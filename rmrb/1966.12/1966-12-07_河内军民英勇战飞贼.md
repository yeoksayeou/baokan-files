The heroic military and civilians of Hanoi responded to the great call to battle by Chairman Ho Chi Minh. On December 2nd and 4th, they fought bravely, delivering a heavy blow to the American air pirates who dared to attack the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam again. In two days, they achieved the glorious feat of shooting down five American planes, damaging several, and capturing a batch of American pilots. In the battle, they demonstrated an indomitable spirit and strength to defend their country to the death.

The Brave Anti-Aircraft Gunners

On the afternoon of the 2nd, the air raid alarm suddenly sounded in Hanoi. At a certain anti-aircraft artillery position, the soldiers immediately loaded the shells and stood ready. When the enemy planes approached, all the cannons on the position roared, scattering the enemy planes in all directions. Some of them hastily hid in the clouds. Four American planes attempted to use the clouds as cover to dive down and wreak havoc. However, they could not escape the eyes of the anti-aircraft gunners. A volley of hate-filled shells met them head-on, and one of the enemy planes was hit before it could escape.

"Hit them hard, and win glory for the people of the capital!" This was the call from Political Instructor Vu Dinh Nhan. Like the shuttle of a loom, he rushed from one gun position to another, mobilizing the soldiers for battle.

"Defend the country to the death!" The soldiers expressed their battle resolve. Although some soldiers were injured in the battle, they refused to leave their posts and continued to fight. The cannons roared on, and another American plane was blown to pieces. The injured American pilot who jumped out of the plane was captured on the spot.

Avenging the People of the Capital

During the capital's defense battle on the 4th, the soldiers of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit's 71st Company fought bravely. That afternoon, as soon as the enemy planes entered Hanoi, they were hit by a plane shot down by the brave gunners of the 71st Company. The second gunner, Nguyen Van Khai, was injured in the head, but when the company commander ordered him to go for treatment, he refused, saying firmly: "The American aggressors are bombing our capital and killing our loved ones. I must continue to fight and avenge the people of the capital!"

Company Political Instructor Nguyen Ngoc, despite the flying shrapnel, ran back and forth on the battlefield, encouraging the soldiers to fight hard and achieve new battle victories to celebrate the victories of the Southern Liberation Army. A piece of shrapnel hit him, but he paid no attention and continued to direct the battle. The soldiers of the entire company were greatly inspired, their fighting spirit soared, and they fought even more bravely, finally coordinating with the brother companies to shoot down another American plane.

The People Are the True Heroes

During the two days of battle on the 2nd and 4th, the vast number of militia and civilians in Hanoi bravely took to the battlefield, supporting the troops and striking back at the enemy planes. At a certain factory in the suburbs of Hanoi, Deputy Director and Deputy Platoon Leader of the militia, Nguyen Van Hai, was directing the team members in practicing with machine guns. Suddenly, American aggressor planes swooped into the sky over Hanoi, and bombs exploded around the factory and the position. Nguyen Van Hai was furious and immediately stood up, aiming his machine gun and firing fiercely at the enemy planes. The team members also bravely fired at the enemy planes with their rifles. Although bombs exploded around them, some team members were blown over and injured, but they stood up again and continued to fire, finally holding out to the last victory and defending the factory.

At every anti-aircraft artillery position, countless militia and civilians were risking their lives to support the battle. At a certain anti-aircraft artillery position, a 12-year-old boy, A Vuong, and his father braved the artillery fire to transport shells for the artillery unit. On the 7th Company's anti-aircraft artillery position, nine white-haired old women also participated in supporting the battle. When the soldiers advised them to go into the air-raid shelter, they refused. They excitedly told the soldiers: "We must contribute our strength to the country. We carry the shells and support you, so you can hit the enemy hard!"

After the battle victory, the militia helped the troops repair the fortifications and transport ammunition; various service departments in Hanoi also promptly delivered food to the positions, ensuring that the soldiers had enough to eat and drink, so they could shoot down more American aggressor planes and achieve greater victories.

    河内军民英勇战飞贼
    英雄的河内市军民响应胡志明主席的伟大战斗号召，十二月二日和四日奋勇战斗，给胆敢再次袭击越南民主共和国首都的美国空中强盗以沉重打击，在两天中取得了击落美国飞机五架，击伤多架，活捉一批美国飞行员的辉煌战绩。他们在战斗中表现了英勇不屈、誓死保卫祖国的顽强意志和力量。
    英勇的高射炮手
    二日下午，河内市突然响起了警报声，在某高射炮阵地上，战士们立即把炮弹推上膛，严阵以待。当敌机飞近时，整个阵地上的大炮就怒吼起来，打得敌机四处逃散，有的慌忙钻进云彩里。四架美国飞机妄图利用云彩的掩护俯冲下来逞凶。但是，它们逃脱不了高射炮手的眼睛。一排排仇恨的炮弹迎头打上去，一架敌机来不及逃跑就被击中了。
      “狠狠地打呀，为首都人民立功！”这是政治指导员武庭宁的呼声，他像织布机的梭子一样，奔向各个炮位，对战士们进行着战斗动员。
      “誓死保卫祖国！”战士们纷纷表达自己的战斗决心。虽然有些战士在战斗中受了伤，但是他们不肯离开自己的战斗岗位，仍然坚持战斗。大炮不停地怒吼着，又一架美国飞机被打得粉身碎骨，受伤跳伞的美国飞贼当场被活捉了。
    为首都人民报仇
    在四日首都保卫战中，人民军高射炮某部七一连的指战员们，打得很英勇。当天下午，敌机一钻进河内，就被七一连的神勇炮手们击中一架。二号炮手阮文魁头部受伤，连首长要他下去包扎，他不肯去，斩钉截铁地说：“美国强盗来轰炸我们的首都，杀害我们的亲人，我一定要继续战斗，为首都人民报仇！”
    连政治指导员阮顽，冒着纷飞的战火，在阵地上跑来跑去，动员战士们狠狠地打，用新的战斗成绩，来祝贺南方解放军的胜利。一块弹片把他打伤了，但他毫不在乎，继续坚持指挥战斗。全连的战士们受到极大的鼓舞，斗志更加昂扬，越战越勇，终于又配合兄弟连队打落另一架美国飞机。
    群众是真正英雄
    在二日和四日两天的战斗中，河内的广大民兵自卫队员和人民群众，都奋勇上阵，配合部队，痛击敌机。在河内市郊某工厂的阵地上，副厂长兼自卫队副排长阮文亥，正在指导队员们练习使用机枪。突然，美国强盗飞机窜入河内上空，炸弹就在工厂和阵地的周围爆炸了。阮文亥怒不可遏，立刻站起来，端着机枪向敌机猛烈射击。队员们也勇敢地用步枪射击敌机。虽然炸弹接连在他们周围爆炸，有些队员被炸弹的汽浪冲倒了，受伤了，但他们又站起来，继续射击，终于坚持战斗到最后胜利，保卫了工厂。
    在每一个高射炮阵地上，无数民兵自卫队和人民群众都在奋不顾身地支援战斗。在某高射炮阵地上，十二岁的男孩阿勇和他的父亲一起，冒着炮火，为炮兵部队运送炮弹。在高射炮第七连的阵地上，九位白发苍苍的老大娘，也参加支援战斗的工作。战士们劝她们进防空洞，被她们拒绝了。她们激动地对战士们说：我们一定要为祖国贡献自己的一份力量。我们抬炮弹，支援你们，让你们狠狠地打击敌人！
    在战斗胜利结束后，民兵自卫队又帮助部队整修工事，搬运弹药；河内各服务部门也及时地把饮食送到阵地上，让战士们喝得足吃得饱，更多地打落美国强盗飞机，争取更大的胜利。
