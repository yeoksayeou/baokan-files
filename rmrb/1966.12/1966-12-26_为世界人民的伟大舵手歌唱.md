"Aren't we going to sing 'The Boat Needs a Helmsman' together?" A Latin American friend visiting China asked the guide this question while touring the Jinggangshan Revolutionary Museum.

Why did this foreign guest think of singing this song? He said: "Chairman Mao's thoughts are too great! His theories on people's war, seizing power by force, and establishing rural base areas are all applicable to us... In our country, some people advocate 'legal struggle,' but after struggling and struggling, the power is still in the hands of the enemy, and what we get is still pain! In China, there is Mao Zedong. From the beginning, he led the revolution on the correct path. He knows how to seize power and established the Jinggangshan base area, using the countryside to encircle the cities, and finally achieved national victory. The path that Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to take is the most correct. Therefore, I proposed to sing this song."

After this Latin American friend excitedly finished speaking, he said to the guide: "Let us sing for the great helmsman of the world's people! Please lead the singing."

Thus, the exhibition hall echoed with songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao.

    为世界人民的伟大舵手歌唱
    “让我们一起唱《大海航行靠舵手》好吗？”一位到中国访问的拉丁美洲朋友，在参观井冈山革命博物馆时，向讲解员提出了这样的要求。
    这位外宾为什么会想到唱这支歌呢？他说：“毛主席的思想太伟大了！他的人民战争、枪杆子里面出政权、建立农村根据地的理论，也完全适合于我们……在我们那里，有一部分人喜欢‘合法斗争’，结果斗过来，斗过去，政权还是掌握在敌人手里，我们所得到的却仍然是痛苦！在中国有了毛泽东，一开始他就把革命领到正道上了。他懂得怎样才能夺取政权，并且建立了井冈山根据地，以农村包围城市，最后取得了全国的胜利。毛主席领导中国人民所走的道路是最正确的。所以我提出要唱这首歌。”    这位拉丁美洲朋友激动地说完了这段话，就对讲解员同志说：“让我们为世界人民的伟大舵手歌唱吧！请你领唱。”
    于是，展览厅里响起了歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌声。
