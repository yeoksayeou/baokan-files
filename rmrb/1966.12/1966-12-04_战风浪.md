Battling the Storm

One day, a seven-level strong wind was blowing over the sea. A certain unit's No. 333 transport ship was on duty and reached a small island far from the mainland.

That evening, the meteorological station issued a typhoon warning: Typhoon No. 11 was approaching and might make landfall near the island. The young captain, Chen Zuopei, went ashore to receive instructions from the island's commanding officer to anchor and resist the typhoon. As he walked back, he thought: This island has no sheltered bay, the typhoon's eye will pass right through here, our ship is small and has weak wind resistance; I was just a navigation class leader not long ago, I have no experience in commanding everyone to fight against the typhoon... Thinking of these things, he felt uneasy. But then he remembered Chairman Mao's words: "In times of difficulty, we must see our achievements, see the light, and boost our morale." These teachings gave him great strength! Looking at his comrades on the ship, most of them were Party members and excellent soldiers, who loved Chairman Mao and actively studied his works, and conscientiously carried out his instructions. Now, they would certainly better study and apply Chairman Mao's works to overcome difficulties. With Chairman Mao's works as a powerful ideological weapon, and people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, no difficulty is too great. This made the young captain firm in his resolve to victory.

He returned to the ship at around eleven at night. He made an emergency mobilization speech to everyone. While preparing to resist the typhoon, everyone encouraged each other. Gunner Jiang Yongguang said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that big winds and waves are nothing to fear, human society has developed through big winds and waves. We must follow the path Chairman Mao has opened for us and bravely move forward." Everyone studied Chairman Mao's teachings, as if they heard Chairman Mao's warm voice, everyone was full of energy, and everyone's fighting spirit was high. Although it was pitch-black at night, the strong winds and waves had already arrived, the soldiers were determined to trample the winds and waves underfoot and defeat the strong typhoon.

The next morning, the wind strength gradually increased, and the waves grew higher and higher. The ship rocked violently on the waves. Some soldiers started to feel seasick. In the morning, it was the new soldier Chen Jiasui's turn to cook. He was very seasick, so the Party member and navigation class leader Zhang Xinliang took over his work. The food was cooked, but no one wanted to eat. Party member Xu Jincheng proposed the slogan, "Learn from the heroes, eat for the revolution." The powerful slogan inspired the soldiers, and everyone stubbornly ate the food.

The wind grew stronger, and the waves grew higher. More people started to feel seasick, some comrades even vomited up yellow bile. At this difficult moment, everyone proposed: We can go without food, we can go without sleep, but we cannot go without studying Chairman Mao's works. Class leader Zhang Xinliang and soldier Zhang Zhiquan in the cabin, lying on the bed, feet braced against the wall, steadied themselves and copied out "Resolve to overcome all difficulties, dare to sacrifice, overcome all obstacles, and strive for victory" and other ten or so quotations, preparing to give them to their comrades in the most difficult times. Young Pioneer Jiang Yongguang posted a couplet by Chairman Mao's portrait: "Each sunflower turns to the sun, one red sun shines brightly in our hearts." It expressed the soldiers' feelings in the midst of the big winds and waves.

At three in the afternoon, suddenly the two ropes tying the small boat broke, and the boat was swept away by the giant waves. The soldiers, who usually cherished every drop of oil, every cent, and every grain of rice for the revolution, how could they stand by and watch state property be damaged? They all volunteered to jump into the sea to rescue the boat. The soldiers' spirit of valuing state property more than their own lives deeply moved the captain. What fine soldiers they were! But at this moment, the sea was boiling, each wave was like a mountain, jumping into the sea to rescue the boat was like snatching a sheep from a tiger's mouth, could he let his comrades take this risk? Under the soldiers' repeated requests, he and his comrades analyzed the wind direction and water flow, deciding to send the best swimmers, Party member Lin Yubei and Young Pioneer Shen Genlin, into the sea. They jumped into the sea, one moment being thrown high by the waves, the next moment submerged under the waves. When they approached the boat, they found that it had been flipped over by the waves and was lodged on the rocks. To rescue the boat, they had to climb onto the rocks. The waves' impact on the rocks was very strong, making it dangerous to climb up, and one wrong move could result in being smashed against the rocks. Lin Yubei and Shen Genlin took advantage of the gap between two waves, quickly climbing onto the rocks. When they returned to the ship, their comrades asked where they got their strength from. They smiled and said: We study Chairman Mao's works every day, and in the midst of the surging waves, we thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "No matter how the wind blows or the waves beat, it's like a leisurely stroll in the courtyard." Thinking of these words, it was as if they were by Chairman Mao's side, and they felt invincible.

Night fell, and the wind strength increased to above eleven levels. The wind blew the bridge swaying and creaking. Mountain-high waves crashed down on the bridge, the ship rocked violently, and the tilt angle exceeded thirty-five degrees. According to navigation theory, exceeding forty-five degrees would cause the ship to capsize. The situation was critical! In this emergency, what should be done? Chen Zuopei's mind flashed with Chairman Mao's words: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles." He immediately followed Chairman Mao's instructions, consulting with Party members, deciding to drop two anchors, stand double watch, strengthen observation, and be prepared to take emergency measures if the ship's position moved. At this time, the sea was pitch-black, the rain and waves beat against people's eyes, making it hard to see, and a moment of carelessness could result in being swept into the sea. Many comrades, though they had not eaten much in over a day, still stubbornly fought against the strong winds and waves. Xu Jincheng thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on the exemplary role of Party members, and to let everyone rest more, he volunteered to stand watch for others. He crawled around the deck, checking and securing every movable item. During the typhoon's most ferocious time, he stood watch for four consecutive hours.

At around eleven at night, a signal came from the shore: "Commander's order: Cut the anchor chain, proceed at full speed, run aground on the beach, disembark with weapons." This was a concern for the soldiers' safety, and everyone was grateful. They said: "The ship is state property, it is our home, it is our battlefield. People are on the battlefield, this is the glorious tradition of the PLA." Everyone unanimously requested to both save people and the ship, and better execute the order. At this time, to untangle the anchor hook caught in the cable, drive the ship closer to the shore, and better execute the superior's order, all the comrades on the ship launched a new battle. On the front deck, everyone tried every means, fighting in the wind and rain for two hours, but still couldn't untangle it. At this time, Party member Xu Jincheng stepped forward, tying a rope around himself, fearlessly climbing onto the ship's exterior, standing on the anchor to untangle it. The newly enlisted mechanic Chen Jiasui, though very seasick, was alone in the engine room watching over two machines. The light in the engine room was broken by the wind, but he had the red sun of Mao Zedong Thought in his heart. He used his hands to feel his way, accurately starting and operating the machines for over two hours until dawn, driving the ship closer to the shore.

The comrades on the No. 333 ship, after a day and night of fighting, finally defeated the strong typhoon, ensuring the safety of people and the ship. They experienced a test of big winds and waves, and also a test of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in big winds and waves. The soldiers said: Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible and unstoppable powerful ideological weapon. Following Chairman Mao's words, no wind or wave is to be feared.

专栏：活学活用毛主席著作的故事

    战风浪
    一天，海上刮着七级大风。某部三三三号运输船，执勤到达了远离祖国大陆的一个前沿小岛。
    当晚，气象台发出了台风警报：十一号台风即将来临，可能在小岛附近一带沿海登陆。年轻的船长陈佐培，上岸接受了驻岛部队首长交代的就地抛锚避风抗台任务回来，边走边想：这个小岛没有避风港湾，台风中心又要从这里经过，我们的船吨位小，抗风力弱；自己不久以前，还只是一个航海班长，没有指挥大家与台风作斗争的经验，……一想到这些，他心里很不平静。可是，他想起了毛主席语录：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”这些教导给他多大力量啊！再看看全船同志，绝大部分是党团员和五好战士，平时热爱毛主席，积极学习毛主席著作，自觉地执行毛主席的指示，现在一定会更好地活学活用毛主席著作，战胜困难。有了毛主席著作这个强大的思想武器，有了毛泽东思想武装起来的人，天大的困难也不可怕。这使年轻的船长坚定了胜利的信心。
    他回到船上，已经是夜里十一点多了。他向大家作了紧急动员。大家一面作抗台风准备，一面互相鼓励。枪炮班长江永光说：“毛主席教导我们，大风大浪也不可怕，人类社会就是从大风大浪中发展起来的。我们要沿着毛主席开辟的航道勇敢前进。”大家学习了毛主席的教导，好像听到了毛主席亲切的声音，人人浑身是劲，个个斗志昂扬。尽管夜漆黑，大风浪已经袭来，战士们决心要把风浪踩在脚下，战胜强台风。
    第二天上午，风力逐渐加强，海浪一浪高过一浪，船在浪峰上颠簸着，摇摆得很厉害。有的战士开始晕船。早晨，轮到新战士陈加岁做饭，他晕船晕得很厉害，共产党员、航海班长张新良主动代替他工作。饭烧好了没有人要吃。党员徐金崇同志提出“向英雄们学习，为革命吃饭”的口号。有力的口号鼓舞了战士们，大家顽强地把饭吃下去。
    风越来越大，浪越来越高。晕船的人多起来了，有的同志饭吐光了，吐黄水。在这困难时刻，大家提出：饭可以不吃，觉可以不睡，毛主席著作不能不学。班长张新良和战士张志谦在驾驶室里，趴在铺位上，脚顶住床壁，摇摇晃晃地坚持抄写了“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”等十几条语录，准备到最困难的时刻赠送给战友们。共青团员江永光在毛主席像旁边贴了一副对联：“朵朵葵花向太阳，一轮红日心里亮。”它表达了在大风大浪里战士们的心情。
    下午三点，突然拴小舢板的两根绳索都断了，舢板被巨浪卷走了。战士们平时为革命对一滴油、一分钱、一粒米都十分爱惜，现在怎么能眼看国家的财产受损失？争着要求下海去把舢板抢救回来。战士们这种把国家财产看得比自己生命还重的精神，深深地激动着船长，这是一些多么好的战士啊！但是眼前海水像开了锅，一个浪头就是一座山，这时候下海抢救舢板，真好比虎口夺羊，能让同志们去冒这个风险吗？在战士们再三的请求下，他和同志们分析了风向和水流情况，决定派水性最好的共产党员林玉杯和共青团员沈根林下海。只见他们跳下海一下子被浪抛得高高的，一下子又埋在浪里头，当他们靠近舢板时，发现舢板已经被海浪掀起，搁在岩石上面了。要抢救舢板，就要登上岩石。海浪对岩石的冲击力很大，人要登上去很危险，弄不好就要撞在岩石上。只见林玉杯和沈根林乘两个浪的空隙，迅速地登上了岩石。当他们回到船上，同志们问他们这股子劲从哪里来的？他们笑着说：我们平时天天学习毛主席著作，在激流巨浪里就想起了毛主席的教导：“不管风吹浪打，胜似闲庭信步”。一想到这些，就好像自己就在毛主席的身边，浑身有了使不完的力量。
    天黑下来了，风力增强到十一级以上。风刮得驾驶台摇摇晃晃，格吱格吱地响。山一般高的浪头，劈头盖脑地向驾驶台压过来，船身摇晃得很厉害，左右倾斜角超过了三十五度。航海理论上说，超过四十五度，就要翻船。情况很严重！在这危急的情况下怎么办？陈佐培脑子里闪现了毛主席的一段话：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。”他立即按照毛主席的指示，分头和党员商量，决定抛双锚，站双岗，加强观察，以便在万一发生船位移动时采取紧急措施。这时，海上漆黑漆黑，暴雨和海浪打得人睁不开眼睛，稍不小心，人就可能被风浪卷到海里去。不少同志虽然一天多没有吃多少饭，但他们仍然顽强地和大风浪搏斗着。徐金崇同志，想起了毛主席关于共产党员应起模范作用的教导，为了让大家多休息，主动为别人站岗。他在甲板上爬来爬去，把能够移动的东西一件一件作了检查和加固。在台风最猖狂的时间里，他连续站了四个钟头的岗。
    深夜十一点多，岸上来了信号：“首长命令：砍断锚链，全速前进，开到沙滩搁浅，人员带着武器上岸。”这是对战士安全的关怀，大家很感激。他们说：“船是国家的财产，是我们的家，是我们的阵地。人在阵地在，是解放军的光荣传统。”大家一致要求既保人又保船，更好地执行命令。这时，为了解开被电缆缠住的锚爪，把船驶近岸边，更好地执行上级命令，全船同志又投入了新的战斗。在前甲板上，大家想尽办法，在狂风暴雨中战斗了两个小时，还是解不开。这时，共产党员徐金崇，挺身而出，身上系着绳子，不畏艰险，爬到船外，站到锚上去解。今年刚入伍的机电兵陈加岁，晕船比较厉害，但他一个人在机房里看着两部机器。机房里的灯被风刮坏了，没有灯，但是他心中有毛泽东思想的红太阳，他用手摸着，准确地起动和操纵机器两个多小时，直到天明，把船驶近了岸边。
    三三三号船的同志们经过一天一夜搏斗，终于战胜了强台风，保证了人员和船只的安全。他们经历了一次大风大浪的考验，也经历了一次在大风大浪中活学活用毛主席著作的锻炼。战士们说：毛泽东思想是战无不胜、攻无不克的强大思想武器。听毛主席的话，再大的风浪也不可怕。
