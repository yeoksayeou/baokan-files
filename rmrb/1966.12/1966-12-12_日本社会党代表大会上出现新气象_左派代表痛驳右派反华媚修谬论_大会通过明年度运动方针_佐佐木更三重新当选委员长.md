The 28th National Congress of the Japan Socialist Party was held in Tokyo from December 6 to 9. The congress adopted the movement guidelines for 1967 and elected a new central leadership. Sasakawa Kyuzo was re-elected as chairman.

During the discussion on the 1967 movement guidelines, the left and right factions of the Socialist Party engaged in fierce debates on several key issues: how to evaluate China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, how to deal with the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters, and how to analyze the role of Soviet modern revisionists in the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam.

Some right-wing representatives viciously attacked the joint statement signed by the Japan-China Friendship Association and the China-Japan Friendship Association in Beijing, claiming that the statement should not condemn Soviet modern revisionists. They also attacked some Socialist Party members who had visited China and praised the Cultural Revolution. The left-wing representatives of the Socialist Party engaged in sharp debates with these fallacies, leaving the right-wing representatives speechless and resorting to disrupting the meeting.

Representative Matsuba Jun from Miyazaki Prefecture said, "China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a necessary path to eliminate the foundation of revisionism and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat." He added, "The Cultural Revolution is a great undertaking that has never been done before. Its guiding ideology, Mao Zedong Thought, is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. We must strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought."

Representative Hasuoi Shinjiro from Fukuoka Prefecture said, "Strengthening friendship with the 700 million people of China is crucial in crushing the U.S. imperialists and reactionaries of various countries that aim to contain China. To accomplish this task, we must eliminate those who, under the banner of Japan-China friendship, actually sabotage Japan-China friendship." He advocated supporting the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters.

Representative Ishino Hisao from Ibaraki Prefecture also advocated supporting the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters.

Representative Kiyomiya Shiro from Tokyo emphasized that the international united action to support Vietnam should not include Soviet revisionism. Kiyomiya also said, "If we do not recognize and correctly evaluate China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we cannot correctly grasp the international situation."

Representative Sugiyama Kacho from Yamaguchi Prefecture stressed, "The joint statement signed by the Japan-China and China-Japan Friendship Associations in Beijing points out the correct path for the Japan-China friendship movement." Sugiyama listed facts of how the new followers of Soviet modern revisionism sabotaged the Japan-China friendship movement and strongly condemned it. Sugiyama emphasized the need to boldly expose the crimes of modern revisionism.

The Oriental News Agency pointed out that this is the first time so many representatives from local Socialist Party organizations have severely criticized the treacherous line and anti-China policies of Soviet modern revisionism and their new followers, highly evaluated China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and emphasized the necessity of studying Mao Zedong Thought at a Socialist Party congress. This reflects the recent growth of progressive forces within the Socialist Party.

The movement guidelines adopted by the congress reflect the demands of the left wing, but as a compromise, they also include the right-wing's content.

The guidelines emphasize the need to struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam and the Sato Cabinet's participation in the aggression, as well as to strive for the establishment of normal diplomatic relations with China. They point out that domestic and foreign reactionary forces use China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and nuclear missile tests to engage in anti-China propaganda, aiming to cover up the facts of the U.S.-Japan military alliance and participation in aggression. The guidelines advocate breaking through this attempt as an important task. They emphasize opposition to the conspiracy of "two Chinas" and hostile policies towards China, advocating for the comprehensive development of friendly exchanges in trade, culture, and personnel, and striving for the success of the Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival. However, the guidelines also praise Yugoslavia and India for their efforts to achieve international peace and do not mention the betrayal line of the Soviet leadership. Instead, they advocate for further active friendly exchanges between Japan and the Soviet revisionist leadership.

In the newly elected leadership, in addition to Sasakawa Kyuzo being re-elected as chairman and Noda Tomomi re-elected as secretary-general, Yamamoto Yukikazu, Kono Hide, and Katsumata Seiichi were elected as vice-chairmen. Among the 19 central executive committee members, 15 belong to the Sasakawa faction and the left wing.

    日本社会党代表大会上出现新气象
    左派代表痛驳右派反华媚修谬论
    大会通过明年度运动方针　佐佐木更三重新当选委员长
    据新华社十一日讯东京消息：日本社会党从六日到九日在东京举行第二十八次全国代表大会，会上通过了一九六七年度运动方针，改选了中央领导机构。佐佐木更三重新当选委员长。
    在讨论一九六七年度运动方针的过程中，社会党的左右两派在如何评价中国的无产阶级文化大革命、如何对待日中友好协会（正统）总部、如何分析苏联现代修正主义者在美帝国主义侵越战争中所起作用等问题上，展开了激烈的斗争。一些右派代表恶毒地攻击了日中友好协会和中日友好协会在北京签署的共同声明，说什么共同声明不应该谴责苏联现代修正主义者。他们还攻击一些访华的社会党人赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命。社会党左派代表同这些谬论进行了针锋相对的辩论。使右派理屈词穷，只好求助于会上起哄，无理取闹。
    宫崎县的代表松叶纯说：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命是为了清除修正主义的基础、巩固无产阶级专政的必经之路。”他说：“无产阶级文化大革命是前人从来没有做过的伟大事业。这个革命的指导思想毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。我们一定要努力活学活用毛泽东思想。”
    福冈县代表莲尾信次郎说：“同中国七亿人民加强友好，在粉碎美帝国主义和各国反动派‘遏制’中国方面，是最重要的任务。为了完成这个任务，当然就要排除那些举着日中友好的旗帜，实际上破坏日中友好的势力。”他主张，应当支持日中友好协会（正统）总部。
    茨城县代表石野久男也主张应当支持日中友好协会（正统）总部。
    东京代表清宫四郎强调指出，支援越南的国际统一行动中不能包括苏联修正主义。清宫还说：“如果不正视中国的无产阶级文化大革命，不给予正确的评价，那就不能正确地掌握国际形势。”
    山口县代表杉山加昌强调说：“日中和中日两个友好协会日前在北京签署的共同声明指出了日中友好运动的正确道路。”杉山列举了苏联现代修正主义新追随者破坏日中友好运动的事实，并且猛烈地谴责了它。杉山强调应当大胆地揭露现代修正主义的罪恶。
    东方通讯社指出，有这么多来自社会党地方组织的代表严厉地批判苏联现代修正主义及其新追随者的叛卖路线和反华政策，高度评价中国的无产阶级文化大革命，强调学习毛泽东思想的必要性，这在日本社会党大会上还是第一次。它反映社会党内部的进步势力近来有了增长。
    大会通过的运动方针反映了左派的要求，但作为一种妥协，也写进了右派的货色。
    运动方针一方面强调要进行斗争反对美帝国主义侵略越南和佐藤内阁参与侵略以及争取同中国建立正常的邦交关系；指出日本国内外反动势力把中国的无产阶级文化大革命和核导弹试验利用来进行反华宣传，企图掩盖美日军事同盟和参与侵略的事实，主张把打破这种企图作为重要的任务；强调反对“两个中国”的阴谋和敌视中国的政策，要全面地发展贸易、文化和人员等方面的友好交流，同时要为使日中青年大联欢成功而奋斗。但是另一方面，运动方针又吹捧南斯拉夫、印度“为争取国际和平而作出的努力”，而且对苏联领导的叛卖路线只字不提，相反地主张同苏联修正主义领导集团“必须进一步积极进行日苏之间的友好交流”。
    在新选出的领导机构中，除了佐佐木更三重新担任社会党委员长、成田知巳连任书记长外，还选出山本幸一、河野密、胜间田清一为副委员长。在十九名中央执行委员中，属于佐佐木派和左派的占十五名。
