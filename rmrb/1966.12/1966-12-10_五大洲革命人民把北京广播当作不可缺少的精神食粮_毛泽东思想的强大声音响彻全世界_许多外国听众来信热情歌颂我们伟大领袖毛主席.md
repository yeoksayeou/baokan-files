The revolutionary people of the five continents regard Beijing Radio as an indispensable spiritual food. The powerful voice of Mao Zedong Thought resonates throughout the world. Many foreign listeners have written letters expressing their enthusiastic praise for our great leader Chairman Mao.

“Listen, this is Beijing Radio, this is the voice of Mao Zedong Thought!” Every day, across the five lakes and four seas, on the five continents, countless revolutionary people listen attentively to the voice of Mao Zedong Thought broadcast from Beijing with excited hearts. They say they love listening to Beijing Radio, just as they cannot do without food every day.

During the high tide of China’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many foreign listeners from different regions and different battlefronts and workplaces have sent letters to China, enthusiastically praising our great leader Chairman Mao, and talking about how they have learned the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary world—Mao Zedong Thought—through Beijing Radio, far away from China, and how they are closely connected with the revolutionary people of China.

Mao Zedong Thought is a spiritual atomic bomb.

An elderly French woman named Ah Feng, after listening to Beijing Radio, wrote a poem with affectionate feelings, titled “Ah! Chairman Mao, You Are the Flame of Hope!” She wrote in the poem:

	We, we French people, miss you!
	Your radio station broadcasts your thoughts to us,
	Your thoughts illuminate communism.
	Every time we think of your greatness,
	Your great light illuminates our hearts.
	Whether it is cloudy or sunny,
	Your thoughts are always a fiery red sun.

A Pakistani listener, Nawaz, wrote in his letter with utmost respect: “I think Chairman Mao Zedong is a great, respected, and rare leader in the history of all nations. The Chinese people follow Chairman Mao Zedong, use the principles pointed out by Chairman Mao, and achieve unprecedented great achievements in the world. Our enemies will be like ants before China. I wish Chairman Mao eternal life.” Another friend from an Asian country, after hearing the radio broadcast about the Chinese people and the people of the world loving Chairman Mao, was deeply moved. He wrote in his letter: “Chairman Mao Zedong possesses the highest wisdom of the Chinese people. The sea voyage relies on the helmsman. Chairman Mao steers China, breaking through the giant waves of the world. Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao!”

A Japanese friend, Kawamura, wrote in his letter: “Beijing Radio has sent the spiritual atomic bomb—Mao Zedong Thought’s long-range nuclear missile—to the world; this is the strongest and invincible weapon on Earth!”

A soldier of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, Du Youyi, sent a letter from the frontline of the anti-American struggle. He said: “We are fighting with guns to defend our motherland, and at the same time, we actively listen to the sincere voice from great China. This voice, like that of brothers, gives us invaluable encouragement and adds strength to our charge.”

A Senegalese listener, Endiya, after listening to Beijing Radio, said: “We need such broadcasts, which can awaken those who have not yet awakened. Let me shout again: Long live Mao Zedong! Long live those who oppose American imperialism with words and deeds!”

A friend from Uruguay, Mrs. Doroleis, sent a letter from the other side of the Pacific Ocean: “Beijing Radio has become my spiritual food, and I will never stop listening to Beijing Radio until I die.” She told her Chinese friends in the letter that when she listened to the live broadcast of the National Day of the People’s Republic of China by Beijing Radio, she was so moved that tears streamed down her face, and she wanted to shout with the Chinese people: Long live the People’s Republic of China! Long live Chairman Mao! She also said in the letter: “You don’t know how excited I am to listen to your voice, my joy is indescribable. We are far away but close to your hearts! Until I die, I am a friend of the Chinese people.”

The news of China’s successful launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shaken the world, and revolutionary people everywhere have enthusiastically cheered. A Belgian youth, Saimon, was very excited after hearing the news of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the radio. He wrote in his letter: “The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China, led by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, is a clear sign of the correct Marxist-Leninist line. Although Belgium and China are geographically far apart, the revolutionary spirit brings the Belgian people closer to China. I wish Chairman Mao a long life. Please convey my brotherly feelings to the Red Guards. I deeply love the Red Guards.”

An Italian friend, Sanuri, wrote in his letter: “We know that China’s cultural revolution is a great historical event. It will contribute to the revolutionary cause of the oppressed people of the world and deal a fatal blow to the bourgeoisie and revisionism.” Sanuri said: “With the Chinese people led by Comrade Mao Zedong, revisionism will not appear in China. The Soviet revisionist clique and its followers will surely suffer a miserable defeat.”

A Japanese listener, Yokokawa, admires the Red Guards without limit. He said: “Every time I hear about the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards on Beijing Radio, my heart is moved. The Red Guards make New China even more radiant, which is so touching! The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will make the Chinese people unite around Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, forever unchanging.” An Australian listener, Singh, praised the work of China’s young Red Guards in his letter. A New Zealand listener, Aiken, wrote in his letter: “When I heard your broadcast about the Chinese Red Guards, I was so happy! I think the Soviet Union did not cultivate its young people like the people of China, putting them in class struggle. No language can describe my feelings for your children, youth, and Red Guards in their great movement to forever eliminate all ghosts and monsters.”

China’s radio reports on the great achievements of China’s socialist construction have brought them happiness and inspiration. A Vietnamese listener, Nguyen Yongchang, wrote in his letter: “When we heard the news of China’s successful missile and nuclear weapon test, all of us were very excited. As soon as the good news from Beijing Radio was broadcast, we hugged each other, cheered, and sang the songs ‘The Sea Voyage Relies on the Helmsman’ and ‘The East Is Red’ in Chinese; we shouted: Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao! We will forever shout these slogans.”

A Senegalese listener, Kidi, wrote in his letter: “When I heard the news of China’s missile and nuclear weapon launch on Beijing Radio, I was so happy! I wish China to crush the arrogance of the United States. The people of China are the greatest hope for the revolutionary people of the world, the most reliable flag of freedom for the oppressed. May the Chinese people continue to grow stronger, so that those who try to dominate human destiny can never hold their heads high. The plots of American imperialism and modern revisionism have completely failed.” A Brazilian listener, Segio, quickly wrote a letter to express his congratulations after hearing the broadcast. He wrote in his letter: China’s successful launch of missiles and nuclear weapons has inspired the revolutionary people of the world and is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    五大洲革命人民把北京广播当作不可缺少的精神食粮
    毛泽东思想的强大声音响彻全世界
    许多外国听众来信热情歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席
    “听，这是北京的广播，这是毛泽东思想的声音！”每一天，在五湖四海，在世界的五大洲，多少革命人民怀着激动的心情，守在收音机前，凝神倾听从北京发出的毛泽东思想的声音。他们说，他们爱听北京的广播，就像他们每天不可缺少粮食一样。
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，许多外国听众从不同的地区，从不同的战斗和工作岗位上，写信寄来我国，热情颂扬我们的伟大领袖毛主席，谈到他们通过北京的广播，在远离中国的地方，学习了当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，使他们和革命的中国人民紧紧连结在一起。
  毛泽东思想是精神原子弹
    一位名叫阿凤的法国老太太，听了北京的广播，怀着亲切的感情写了一首诗，题为《啊！毛主席，您是希望的火焰！》她在诗中写道：
    我们，我们法国人在思念您！
    您的电台向我们播诵您的思想，
    您的思想照亮出共产主义。
    每当我们想到您的伟大，
    您伟大的光辉就把我们的心房照亮。
    不管阴天和晴天，
    您的思想总是一轮火红的太阳。
    巴基斯坦听众纳瓦士在来信中，以极其崇敬的心情赞颂说：“我认为毛泽东主席是一位伟大的、尊敬的、在世界各民族历史上罕见的领袖。中国人民跟随着毛泽东主席走，运用毛主席指出的原则，是中国人民在世界上取得空前辉煌的伟大成就的原因。我们的敌人在中国面前将似蝼蚁一般。我祝愿毛主席万寿无疆。”还有一位亚洲国家的朋友，听了电台广播中国人民和世界人民热爱毛主席的报道后，深受感动。他在来信中写道：“毛泽东主席具有中国人民无比崇高的最高智慧。大海航行靠舵手。毛主席为中国掌舵，冲破世界上的巨浪。中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    日本朋友河村来信欢呼：“北京电台向全世界输送了精神原子弹——毛泽东思想的远程核导弹；这是地球上最强大的不可抵御的武器！”
    越南南方解放军战士杜友宜，从反美斗争的最前线寄来了一封信。他说：“我们正在拿枪战斗，保卫祖国，同时也积极收听从伟大的中国传来的真挚的声音。这种亲如兄弟般的声音给我们以十分宝贵的鼓舞，为我们冲锋陷阵增添了力量。”
    塞内加尔听众恩迪亚依听了北京的广播后说：“我们需要这样的广播，它能唤起那些尚未觉醒的人们。让我再高呼一遍：毛泽东万岁！用声明和行动反对美帝国主义的人们万岁！”
    乌拉圭朋友多罗列士夫人，从遥远的太平洋彼岸来信说：“北京广播已经成为我的精神食粮，到死我也不停止收听北京广播。”她在信上告诉中国朋友，当她收听北京电台的中华人民共和国国庆实况广播时，感动得眼泪夺眶而出，真想和中国人民一起高呼：中华人民共和国万岁！毛主席万岁！她在信上还说：“你们不知道我是多么激动地倾听你们的声音，我的高兴无法用语言来描述。我们远在天边，近在心田！到死我也是中国人民的朋友。”
  中国文化大革命震动了全世界
    我国胜利开展无产阶级文化大革命的消息，震动了整个世界，革命人民无不为之热烈欢呼。比利时青年赛尔蒙听到广播无产阶级文化大革命的消息后，感到十分兴奋。他在来信中说：“目前在中国进行的，由伟大舵手毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是正确的马克思列宁主义路线的明显标志。比利时和中国在地理上相距遥远，但革命精神使比利时人民同中国相近。我祝毛主席长寿。请向红卫兵转达我的兄弟般的感情，我深深地热爱红卫兵。”
    意大利朋友萨努里来信赞扬说：“我们知道中国的文化革命是一个伟大的历史事件，它将对全世界被压迫人民的革命事业作出贡献，给资产阶级和修正主义以致命的打击。”萨努里说：“由于有在毛泽东同志领导下的中国人民，修正主义不可能在中国出现。苏联修正主义集团和它的追随者必将遭到惨败。”
    日本听众横江诰无限钦佩红卫兵，他说：“每当从北京广播中听到红卫兵的革命行动时，我的心就被激动。红卫兵使新中国更加焕然一新，这是多么感动人的事情啊！伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，将使中国人民团结在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的周围，永远不变颜色。”澳大利亚听众辛格在来信中赞扬中国年青的红卫兵的工作做得很出色。新西兰听众艾金在信里说：“听到你们关于中国红卫兵的广播时，我是多么高兴啊！我认为苏联过去没有把苏联青少年像人民中国做的那样，把他们放在阶级斗争中来培养。没有语言能形容出我对你们的儿童、青年、红卫兵，在他们永远清除一切牛鬼蛇神的伟大运动中的感情。”世界革命人民分享中国人民的幸福
    中国的广播报告了中国社会主义建设取得伟大成就的喜讯，使他们分享了幸福，受到了鼓舞。越南听众阮勇长在来信中说：“当听到中国发射导弹核武器试验成功的消息时，我们全体同志的心非常激动。北京电台的喜讯一播完，我们互相拥抱，欢呼，用汉语高唱《大海航行靠舵手》《东方红》歌曲；高呼：中国共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！我们要永远高呼这些口号。”
    塞内加尔听众基迪来信说：“当从北京广播里听到中国发射导弹核武器的消息时，我是多么高兴啊！祝中国打掉美国的嚣张气焰。人民中国是全世界革命人民最大的希望，是受压迫者的最可靠的自由旗手。愿中国人民不断强大，使那些企图主宰人类命运的家伙永远抬不起头来。美帝国主义和大肆帮腔的现代修正主义者的阴谋完全破产了。”巴西听众赛吉奥在听到广播后，很快来信表示祝贺。他在信中欢呼，中国发射导弹核武器成功鼓舞了全世界的革命人民，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
