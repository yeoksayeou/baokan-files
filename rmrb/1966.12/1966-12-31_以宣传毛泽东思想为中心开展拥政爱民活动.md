The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Issues a Notice Requiring the Entire Army to Launch the Campaign to Support the Government and Love the People with the Propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as the Center

During the month of supporting the government and loving the people, all units should study and apply Chairman Mao's works together with the masses, and extensively carry out activities to do good deeds for the people, further strengthening military-civilian relations.

	New China News Agency, December 30th: The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice on the activities for the month of supporting the government and loving the people in 1967, requiring the entire army to launch the campaign to support the government and love the people with the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as the center. All units should universally carry out education on the glorious tradition of supporting the government and loving the people, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, humbly learn from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and Red Guards, and extensively carry out activities to do good deeds for the people, further strengthening military-civilian relations.

	The notice states that under the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all officers and soldiers of the entire army must in the month of supporting the government and loving the people in 1967, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, implement Chairman Mao's great call for the entire country and the entire army to become a great school, vigorously launch the campaign to support the government and love the people with the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as the center, and promote a new high tide of the army and the people studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

	The notice states that Chairman Mao as early as during the Anti-Japanese War, established the system of holding a campaign to support the government and love the people every year for our army. Chairman Mao taught us: "The army should solve the problem from the thoughts of every officer and soldier, making them thoroughly understand the importance of supporting the government and loving the people." All units should organize officers and soldiers to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on supporting the government and loving the people and the instructions on the "People's Liberation Army should be a great school," universally carry out education on the glorious tradition of military-civilian unity and supporting the government and loving the people, carry out education on the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, and thoroughly carry out the activities of supporting the government and loving the people.

	The notice emphasizes that vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental task of our army as a work team. Every unit should become a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, and every officer and soldier should become a propagandist for Mao Zedong Thought. During the month of supporting the government and loving the people, all units should, according to the specific circumstances at that time and place, adopt appropriate methods, together with the masses, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and actively carry out propaganda activities in various forms. At the same time, they should extensively carry out activities to do good deeds for the people, further strengthening military-civilian relations.
