Title: From Necessity to Freedom

I am in charge of barracks work, mainly responsible for procurement. At the beginning, I couldn't use an abacus; looking at blueprints with blue backgrounds and white lines, I didn't know what they were drawing; when people asked about the quality of a pile of wood, how many cubic meters, what type and tonnage of trucks were needed for transportation, I didn't know what to say. I was truly clueless, like trying to blow fire with a rolling pin. I thought, I am a soldier, good at fighting, training, standing guard, and sentry duty, but when it comes to dealing with blueprints, plans, procurement, and transportation... I was completely stumped. To be honest, I really wanted to go to some school to study and then do this job. With this question in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: “Learn warfare from warfare—this is our main method. Those who have no opportunity to go to school can still learn warfare, that is, learn from warfare. Revolutionary warfare is the people's business, often not learning first and then doing, but doing and then learning. Doing is learning.” Chairman Mao's teachings made me understand a truth—doing is learning. I thought, from not knowing how to fight to knowing how to fight, from not understanding revolution to understanding some revolutionary principles, wasn't it all learned from practice? For anything, if you don't understand, you must learn, you must do, doing is learning. Revolutionary skills are learned from doing. From necessity to freedom, one must practice seriously. I decided to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and forge ahead bravely.

In 1961, the leadership sent me to Enshi, Hubei, to transport timber. Transporting timber requires some skill. If you can't measure, you can't calculate the quantity; if you can't identify, you can't distinguish good from bad; if you can't tie the rafts properly, they will scatter when encountering waves. To learn these "skills," I first borrowed a theoretical book on timber from the timber transfer station and read it for half a day, but I didn't understand what it was talking about. I thought, since I can't learn from the book, I should go to the labor site and practice myself. The next morning, I went to the site, took off my coat, picked up a hook, jumped onto the raft, and started working with the workers. In the process of labor, the workers voluntarily taught me how to measure and identify timber. They enthusiastically told me how to judge the storage time and quality of timber from its color, the sound of knocking, and the signs of timber changes. They explained while picking out various types of timber for me to compare and observe, making it easy to understand and remember. I thought, the workers really know a lot. Who are the experts? They are the timber experts. True experts can only come from practice. With the patient help of these comrades and through practical training, I quickly learned how to identify timber and other knowledge.

To truly achieve freedom, one must seriously practice according to Chairman Mao's instructions and do. Doing is the struggle to change objective things, and one cannot be careless at all. Here, "completely" and "thoroughly" are also needed, and one cannot settle for "good enough." A little less, half a point less, will bring losses to the Party's cause. Once, I went to Jiangxi to transport flooring. After the ship departed from Nanchang, I made a long-distance call to inform the troops that the goods would be delivered within a week. The troops then notified the relevant units to pick up the goods on time, but it fell through, as the ship did not arrive on time. It turned out that my work was a bit off: I did not calculate the time for changing tugboats at each port. Chairman Mao said: “The correct deployment of the commander comes from the correct decision, the correct decision comes from the correct judgment, the correct judgment comes from thorough and necessary reconnaissance, and the thinking of various reconnaissance materials.” My problem was with the "thorough" part. “Learn from failure.” Before the second batch of ships departed from Jian, I conducted a more thorough investigation at the port bureau, estimated various possible situations that might occur during the voyage, and made a more correct deployment. Thus, each port could change tugboats on time and pass through smoothly. Although this voyage was 400 li more than the previous one, the time to reach the designated location was halved.

To understand the laws of work and learn revolutionary skills, over the years, I have visited many timber workshops in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Xiamen, Nanchang, and other places, learning about the knowledge of various camp equipment in more than 20 regions. The more I see and learn, the more I remember, and I know which places have good furniture and which have high technology.

Things in the world are like this: when you have not yet come into contact with them or understood them, you often feel they are very complicated and frightening, but when you constantly deal with them and understand their laws, you can lead them by the nose and make them serve the revolution. Otherwise, even a simple matter can make you confused and become its slave.

I deeply feel that: all things in the world, whether social or natural, as long as you seriously practice according to Chairman Mao's instructions, you can grasp them. They can no longer control me. As long as we seriously learn while doing, learn swimming while swimming, learn fighting while fighting, we can master any skill. Imperialism, revisionism, all ghosts and monsters will be done away with, and communism will be created by us. This world will be ours.

    从必然到自由
    宋乐山
    我搞营房工作，主要负责采购。开始时，算盘不会拨；看图纸尽是蓝底白道道，不晓得划的啥玩艺；人家问这堆木头哪好哪坏，多少立方？车运计划要什么型号，多大吨位？我都不知说啥好。真是擀面杖吹火，一窍不通。心想，咱是个扛大枪的，打仗、练兵、站岗、放哨还行，叫搞什么图纸，计划，采购，运输……，可就把我给拿捏住了。说实在的，我真想到个什么学校学习学习，再来干这工作。我带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。没有进学校机会的人，仍然可以学习战争，就是从战争中学习。革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”毛主席的教导使我懂得了一个道理——干就是学习。我想，过去由不会打仗到会打仗，由不懂革命到懂得一些革命道理，还不是在实践中学到的吗？无论对什么事情，不懂，就要学，就要干，干起来就是学习。革命的本领就是从干中学出来的。从必然到自由，就是要认真实践。我决心按照毛主席指示的方向，勇往直前闯下去。
    一九六一年，领导上派我到湖北恩施去运木料。运木料可有点学问。不会检尺，就计算不了数量；不会识别，就分不出好坏；木排扎不好，遇到风浪就会打散。为了学到这些“学问”，我先向木材转运站借了一本关于木材的理论书，看了半天，不知说的是啥。我想，书上既学不来，还是到劳动中去亲自实践实践吧。第二天清早，我就到了现场，脱下棉衣，拿起抓钩，跳上木排，和工人一起干起活来。在劳动中，工人同志主动来教我检尺和鉴别木材的知识。他们热情地告诉我怎样从颜色上，从敲打的声音上，从木料变化的征候上，来识别木材存放时间和好坏程度。他们一边讲，一边拣出各种类型的木料让我比较观察，真是又好懂又好记。我心想，工人同志可真有学问。什么是专家？他们就是木材专家。真正的专家只有从实践中才能产生出来。我在这些同志的耐心帮助下，又经过了在实际中的锻炼，很快地就学会了识别木材等知识。
    要想得到真正的自由，就得认真地按照毛主席的指示去实践，去干。干就是变革客观事物的斗争，半点也马虎不得。这里同样需要“完全”、“彻底”，不能搞“差不多”。差一点，差半点，就会给党的事业带来损失。有一回，我到江西运铺板。船由南昌出发以后，我就打长途电话，告诉部队说货物保证在一个星期内运到。部队便通知有关单位派人准时领货，结果却落了空，船没按时到。原来我的工作差了一点：就是没有把每个港口换拖轮的时间计算进去。毛主席说：“指挥员的正确的部署来源于正确的决心，正确的决心来源于正确的判断，正确的判断来源于周到的和必要的侦察，和对于各种侦察材料的联贯起来的思索。”我的问题就出在这“周到”二字上边。“吃一堑长一智”。第二批船由吉安开出前，我到港务局作了比较周到的调查，估计船行到途中可能发生的各种情况，从而作了比较正确的部署。这样，个个港口都能及时换拖，顺利通过。虽然这一次航程比上一次还多四百里，但是，到达指定地点的时间，却比上次缩短了一半。
    为了摸清工作规律，学习革命本领，几年来，北京、上海、沈阳、厦门、南昌等地的许多木材铺，我都登门访问过，了解了二十多个地区的多种营具知识。摸的看的多了，脑子里就记的多了，哪里家具好，哪里技术高，心里都有了数。
    世上的事物都是这样，当你还没有接触它们、认识它们的时候，往往感到它们怪复杂，挺吓人，但当你不断地和它们打交道，摸着了它们的规律以后，就能牵着它们的鼻子走，让它们乖乖地为革命服务。不然的话，一点很简单的事也能把你搞得懵头转向，让你当它的奴隶。
    我深深地体会到：世上的万事万物，不管是社会的或是自然的，只要认真地按照毛主席的指示去实践，就都能把它们捉住。它们再要想拿捏我，就办不到。只要我们认真地在干中学习，在游泳中学习游泳，在斗争中学习斗争，啥本领也能学到手。什么帝国主义、修正主义，一切牛鬼蛇神都得完蛋，共产主义就会被我们创造出来，这世界就是我们的。
