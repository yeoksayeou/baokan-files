Chairman Mao's teachings are the beacon that lights our path forward. We must study them diligently, understand them deeply, and apply them resolutely in our work.

Chairman Mao has repeatedly emphasized the importance of class struggle. We must remain vigilant and never forget the lessons of the past. The enemies of the people are always plotting to undermine our revolution. We must be prepared to defend our gains at all times. Chairman Mao's call for continuous revolution is our guiding light. We must carry out the Cultural Revolution to its conclusion, smashing all reactionary elements and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In all our endeavors, we must adhere to the mass line. The masses are the true heroes. We must learn from them, rely on them, and serve them. Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line are the foundation of our work. We must always remember that the masses are the creators of history, and we must never forget to serve them.

Chairman Mao's thoughts are the guiding principles for our actions. We must study them, understand them, and apply them in our work. Only by doing so can we achieve victory in the great proletarian cultural revolution and build a truly socialist society. Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!
