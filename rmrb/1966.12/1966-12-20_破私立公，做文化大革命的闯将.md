The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches the souls of people. Fundamentally, it is about using Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's souls and thoughts, establishing a communist worldview that is dedicated to the public good.

Some people, however, oppose the struggle to break with selfishness and establish public interest, as well as the struggle to transform worldviews, with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, especially with the current criticism of the capitalist roaders in power within the party. I have personally experienced that this understanding is incorrect. Breaking with selfishness and establishing public interest is not only not opposed to the current revolutionary struggle but is completely consistent with it. Every revolutionary comrade who continually breaks with selfishness and establishes public interest in the movement will greatly promote the healthy development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In June of this year, the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution were ignited in our school. Inspired by revolutionary fervor, I responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and together with other revolutionary comrades, I posted big-character posters to the school Party committee, launching a fierce attack on the capitalist roaders in power within the party and engaging in uncompromising struggle against the work teams that implemented the capitalist reactionary line. As a result, they labeled us as "rightists" and "counter-revolutionaries."

This sharp and complex class struggle was a severe test for me. Initially, my thoughts were in turmoil: for the sake of the people's interests, I must persist in the struggle, but what if the struggle fails? Will it affect my admission to the party, my graduation assignment, and my personal future? A series of personal considerations made me hesitant. With these thoughts, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we not sacrifice our personal interests and abandon our mistakes?" The glorious images of countless revolutionary martyrs inspired me, filling me with strength and courage, making me realize how petty it is to consider only personal gains and losses in sharp and complex struggles. To revolutionize, to be a revolutionary pioneer, one must not be afraid. To truly be unafraid, one must eliminate selfish thoughts and consider only the people's interests, placing personal matters aside. I prepared myself mentally, determined to continue the struggle no matter how difficult and arduous the circumstances. This way, personal selfish thoughts decreased, my mind was liberated, my spiritual appearance changed, my enthusiasm increased, and my confidence grew stronger. Together with other revolutionary comrades, we persisted in the struggle, directing our attack at the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the party, and finally smashed their counter-revolutionary tricks of counterattack.

The revolutionary road is not smooth. Although the capitalist roaders in power within the school have been exposed by the broad revolutionary teachers and students, new problems have arisen with the changing situation of the struggle. The work teams that insisted on the capitalist reactionary line framed the revolutionary masses, set the tone, directed, and replaced them, adopting an "official" attitude towards the revolutionary masses, suppressing and stifling the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. Should we expose and criticize the mistakes and shortcomings of the work teams? Can we oppose them? At that time, many comrades were confused, unable to distinguish right from wrong, and had many misgivings. I also thought: if we oppose them correctly, there will be no problem; if we oppose them incorrectly, what consequences will it bring? Personal selfish thoughts and the idea of dedicating oneself to the public good clashed again.

Chairman Mao said: "Communist Party members must ask why about everything, must think it over carefully in their own minds, consider whether it conforms to reality, whether it is reasonable, and must not blindly follow, must not advocate slavishness." Yes, we must not blindly follow, must not advocate slavishness. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest directive for all our work. Whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, we firmly support and defend; whatever does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we firmly oppose and struggle against. A person who only considers personal matters, with a mind full of selfish thoughts, disregarding the interests of the party and the state, can never become a revolutionary. Thus, we posted big-character posters exposing and criticizing the work teams. Some people in the work teams who insisted on the wrong line were taken aback, relying on their authority, confusing right and wrong, and reversing black and white, putting pressure on us. Some classmates who were temporarily deceived and did not understand the truth were also incited to criticize and accuse us. Suddenly, the whole school was in chaos. Some people who could not withstand the test began to waver. The surrounding pressure weighed heavily on us. I thought, could we withstand it? At this critical moment, I again recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, active, with revolutionary interests as the first priority, and personal interests subordinated to revolutionary interests; no matter when and where, adhere to correct principles, and tirelessly struggle against all incorrect thoughts and behaviors..." Only by being selfless can one be fearless. A true revolutionary is fearless. At the crucial moment of struggle, to abandon revolutionary principles in pursuit of personal interests is a betrayal of the revolution. Under the education and inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, we stood up and exposed the tricks and plots of a handful of people who opposed and sabotaged the Cultural Revolution.

Through tortuous and repeated struggles, we achieved victory. Practice has proven that the truth is on our side, and our revolutionary direction is correct. Victory is also an important test for people. The victory of the struggle made me develop some arrogant and complacent emotions, looking down on those who were deceived, and not listening to opposing opinions. Some comrades even became arrogant, boasting about their personal fame and status. We brought these problems to the study of Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught us that everything should be done for the people's interests. Arrogance and complacency stem from "selfishness" and are not conducive to unity and revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is in full swing, and the revolutionary road is still long. We must continually break with selfishness and establish public interest, and forever revolutionize and advance.

In this Cultural Revolution that touches people's souls, it is a severe test for everyone, a political class without lectures, an exam without tests. The revolutionary struggle over the past few months has made me deeply realize that in the great winds and waves of class struggle, where you stand, whether you can withstand the test, depends on whether you are for the public good or for selfishness; whether you act from the interests of the people or from your own interests.

Only by insisting on acting from the people's interests and continually breaking with selfishness and establishing public interest can one truly master Mao Zedong Thought; with "dare" and "break" at the forefront, adhering to the truth and correcting mistakes, can one be a thorough revolutionary in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    破私立公，做文化大革命的闯将
    红卫兵　聂树人
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。这场革命，从根本上说，就是用毛泽东思想改造人的灵魂，改造人的思想，树立一心为公的共产主义世界观。
    有人却把破私立公、改造世界观的斗争，同无产阶级文化大革命，特别是同当前批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争对立起来。我亲身体会到，这种认识是不对的。破私立公不但与当前的革命斗争不是对立的，而且是完全一致的。每个革命同志在运动中不断破私立公，就会大大推动无产阶级文化大革命更健康地向前发展。
    今年六月间，我校无产阶级文化大革命的烈火点起来了。我激于革命热情，响应了我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席和党中央的号召，和其他革命同志一起给校党委贴了大字报，向党内走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火，向执行资产阶级反动路线的工作组进行了不调和的斗争。结果，他们把我们几个人打成“右派”、“反革命”。
    这场尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争，对我是一个严峻的考验。开初，我的思想斗争是很激烈的：为了人民的利益，我要坚持斗争，但是万一斗争失败了，会不会影响我的入党、毕业分配、个人前途等问题呢？一连串的个人考虑使我顾虑重重。我带着这些思想问题去学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”无数革命先烈的光辉形象鼓舞了我，使我浑身是力量，勇气倍增，认识到一个人在尖锐、复杂的斗争中，只考虑个人利害，是多么渺小啊！要革命，要做革命的闯将，就不能怕。要真正不怕，就要破除私心杂念，一切从人民的利益出发，把个人的一切置之度外。我作好一切思想准备，决心不论在任何艰难困苦的情况下，一定要继续战斗下去。这么一来，个人私心杂念少了，思想解放了，精神面貌变了，劲头就更足了，信心也更强了。我和其他革命同志一起，坚持斗争，把斗争矛头针对着一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，终于粉碎了他们进行反扑的反革命伎俩。
    革命的道路不可能是平坦的。学校中走资本主义道路的当权派虽然被广大革命师生揪出来了，但是，随着斗争形势的变化，新的问题又出现了。坚持资产阶级反动路线的工作组，给革命群众划框框，定调子，指手划脚，包办代替，对待革命群众采取“官老爷”的态度，压制、扼杀群众的革命热情。对工作组的错误、缺点该不该揭发、批评？能不能反对？当时，不少的同志受到迷惑，辨别不清是非，顾虑很大。我也想：若是反的对了，没有问题；反错了，又会带来什么样的后果？个人的私心杂念和一心为公的思想又斗争起来了。
    毛主席说：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”对，不能盲从，不能提倡奴隶主义。毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的最高指示。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，我们坚决赞成、拥护，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，我们坚决反对、斗争。一个人光是考虑个人，满脑子的私心杂念，置党和国家的利益于不顾，他就决不能成为一个革命者。于是，我们又贴出揭发批判工作组的大字报。工作组中一些坚持错误路线的人，惊慌失措，仗恃职权，混淆是非，颠倒黑白，对我们施加压力。一时被蒙蔽而不明真相的同学也被挑动起来对我们进行非难和指责。霎时间，全校闹得乌烟瘴气。一时经受不住考验的人开始动摇了。周围的千钧之力不断向我们压来。我想，能不能顶得住？在这个关键的时刻，我又想起毛主席的教导：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争，……”。无私才能无畏。真正的革命者，是无所畏惧的。在紧要的斗争关头，放弃革命的原则而图谋个人私利，这是对革命的背叛。在毛泽东思想的教育和鼓舞下，我们挺身而出，揭露了一小撮人对抗和破坏文化大革命的阴谋诡计。
    经过曲折的、反复的斗争，我们取得了胜利。实践证明真理在我们一方面，我们的革命大方向是正确的。胜利对人又是一个重要的考验。斗争的胜利使我思想上滋长了一些骄傲自满情绪，看不起受蒙蔽的人，听不得相反意见。有些同志甚至尾巴翘得老高，闹起个人名誉地位来了。我们又带着这些问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们，一切从人民的利益出发。骄傲自满是从“私”字出发，是不利于团结，不利于革命的。无产阶级文化大革命方兴未艾，革命的道路还很长，我们必须不断破私立公，永远革命，永远前进。
    在这场触及人们灵魂的文化大革命中，对于每一个人都是一个严峻的考验，是不上课的政治课，是不经考试的考试。几个月来的革命斗争，使我深深体会到：在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，你站在什么立场，经不经得起考验，就要看你是为公，还是为私；是从人民群众的利益出发，还是从自己的利益出发。
    只有坚持一切从人民利益出发，不断破私立公，才能把毛泽东思想真正学到手；“敢”字当头，“破”字当头，坚持真理，修正错误，才能在无产阶级文化大革命中当一名彻底的革命派。
