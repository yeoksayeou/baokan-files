Chairman Mao said: "It is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life, not to do bad deeds, to consistently benefit the broad masses, to consistently benefit the youth, to consistently benefit the revolution, to struggle hard for decades as if it were just one day. This is the most difficult thing!" I have been involved in the revolution with the Party and Chairman Mao for over twenty years, and I can say that I have done some good deeds. However, how can one do good deeds all one's life? How can one maintain integrity and see the revolution through to the end? Over the past two years, through studying Chairman Mao's works and participating in class struggle, I have begun to find the "golden key" to unlock this problem. That is, to use the "Three Articles" to revolutionize one's soul, eliminate bourgeois ideology, reform one's worldview, and promote ideological revolutionization.

The weaker the body, the more one must maintain vigorous revolutionary spirit

I have suffered serious injuries, had pneumonia, liver disease, and long-term neurasthenia. In the autumn of 1964, during a critical period of the unit's mission, my condition worsened, and my body deteriorated. Faced with this situation, I reread "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and Chairman Mao's thoughts gave me boundless strength.

Chairman Mao said: "To struggle means to make sacrifices, and death is a common occurrence. But we think of the interests of the people, of the sufferings of the majority of the people, and we die for the people, and that is a worthy death." This made me further realize that a revolutionary fighting for the great and arduous cause of communism must be prepared to make sacrifices at any time. I made up my mind: if alive, I will work; if dead, it will be a worthy death.

At that time, the combat readiness tasks were quite heavy. I focused on political and ideological work to boost the unit's morale and adjusted the positions and deployment of weapons. During the day, I went deep into the field to guide, and at night, I insisted on combat readiness duty. Once, while on combat duty, I fainted while talking on the phone. After regaining consciousness, comrades advised me to rest. I thought, this is a battle, how can a commander leave his post at this critical moment? I poured some cold water on my head and continued working.

Comrades often cared about my health. I thought that while the body is the capital of the revolution, the revolution is the soul of the body! If a person only has a strong body but does not revolutionize, isn't that just a "mummy"? In the past, countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives without hesitation. Today, with just a little pain, what is there to worry about?

Last autumn, my condition worsened, and the leadership wanted me to go to the hospital. On my way to the hospital, I heard that a large number of cadres were going to the countryside to participate in the "Four Clean-ups" movement. I turned back from the halfway point and insisted on returning to the unit to resume work. Later, the leadership decided that I should rest for a year. In the sanatorium, I repeatedly read the "Three Articles" and thought, the unit's work is so heavy, how can I idle away and rest? I finally managed to leave the hospital early.

However, as soon as I returned to the unit, the organization, in order to let me fully recover, ordered me to leave my post and rest. Hearing this decision, I was deeply grateful to the Party for its care, but I also thought, how can I eat the people's provisions and stay at home? Back home, I opened the "Three Articles" again. Chairman Mao pointed out that a person's abilities may be large or small, but as long as they have a spirit of selflessness, they can become a great benefit to the people. I thought, a person's physique may be strong or weak, and their condition may be light or heavy, but the spirit of selflessness is indispensable. The organization, in order to protect cadres, let me rest, but I absolutely cannot have the idea of abandoning work to preserve myself. Especially after learning about the glorious deeds of Mao Zedong's good student, Jiao Yulu, I was deeply moved. I thought, a revolutionary's position can be handed over, but revolutionary work should shine as long as there is a spark of heat. I actively sought to do some things within my abilities. Every time I participated in a specific activity, I felt an indescribable joy because I had fulfilled my duty to the people.

Through these years of fighting against illness, I deeply felt that chronic physical illness is not frightening; it can at most destroy my body but cannot destroy my revolutionary will. What is frightening is chronic illness of the mind. In a peaceful environment and under relatively good living conditions, indulging in comfort, losing fighting spirit, fearing death, seeking ease, and doing nothing, that is the most dangerous.

The higher the position, the more one must maintain the spirit of an ordinary soldier

After taking on leadership duties in the unit, I gradually developed an "official" attitude and unconsciously had an "official" demeanor. When encountering unpleasant things, I spoke loudly, and when seeing things I didn't like, I got even angrier, sometimes even slamming the table. In the past, I often used my bad temper and poor cultivation as an excuse to forgive myself. During the rectification movement in 1959, the masses posted many big-character posters for me, and I became alert. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Many people do not handle the relationship between officers and soldiers, or between the military and the people, well. They think it is a matter of method, but I always tell them it is a matter of fundamental attitude (or fundamental purpose). This attitude is to respect soldiers and respect the people." I realized that the problem was not one of method, but of fundamental attitude, forgetting that I was one of the masses, forgetting that I, like the soldiers, was a servant of the people. I decided to further correct my shortcomings according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

First, I regarded myself as a servant of the soldiers, regarded cadres and soldiers as my class brothers and close comrades, and regarded the company as the starting point for the work of leading cadres, with sincere enthusiasm to go deep among the masses and connect with the masses, and to care for every comrade politically and in life.

Chairman Mao said: "Our cadres must care for every soldier, and everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other." He also said: "Communist Party members should be friends of the people in mass movements, not their superiors, not tireless teachers, but not bureaucratic politicians." In daily work and life, I paid attention to treating people equally, and when problems arose, I patiently persuaded and reasoned with them. There was a cadre in my unit who was somewhat arrogant and could not accept criticism. I thought: although he has shortcomings, he is a revolutionary comrade from a poor peasant background. As long as we help him with deep class feelings and arm him with Mao Zedong Thought, he will not fail to become red. So, I took the initiative to study with him and have heart-to-heart talks. Now he actively studies Chairman Mao's works and has made great progress. This fact gave me a deep lesson: the more "official" a leading cadre is, the farther the soldiers are from him; the less "official" he is, the closer the soldiers are to him; when the "official" attitude is gone, the soldiers' hearts are connected with his.

On the other hand, I also paid attention to caring for every comrade in life. Every time I went to the company, I paid attention to doing beneficial things for the company. Through these practical activities, the feelings between the leadership and the grassroots cadres and soldiers became more harmonious.

Secondly, in terms of ideology, one must constantly struggle against the "official" attitude, prevent the sense of superiority, and in action, always appear in the posture of an ordinary laborer, becoming a genuine servant of the people.

Chairman Mao said: "All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people...." I thought, since we are servants of the people, we only have the obligation to do our work well and no right to demand special treatment. Therefore, every time I went to a company, I paid attention to blending in with the soldiers. When the soldiers studied, I also studied; when the soldiers carried manure, I also carried manure; when the soldiers repaired the fortifications, I also repaired the fortifications. At night, when the company cadres checked the beds and sentries, I also participated. And in life details, I restrained myself, not seeking special treatment. In the company and on business trips, I tried to live with the comrades to facilitate heart-to-heart talks and work discussions. On holidays, I often visited the soldiers, had heart-to-heart talks with everyone, organized cultural activities, told stories, and sometimes stood guard and sentry for the soldiers to watch movies and enjoy the holiday. These seemingly small things, but thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings that "our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people. Cadres participate in collective production labor, maintaining the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucracy, prevent revisionism and dogmatism," I felt that doing so had great significance. It not only maintained our army's glorious tradition but also helped to promote my own and the unit's ideological revolutionization.

In the struggle against the "official" attitude, I deeply felt that a leading cadre, regardless of his position, should always be a servant of the people, with a heart full of concern for all the comrades in the unit, and only then can he truly connect with the masses.

I am using the "Three Articles" to solve the problem of how to revolutionize and be a good person in the second half of my life, and this is just the beginning. I firmly respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, determined to revolutionize for life, study the "Three Articles" for life, promote my own ideological revolutionization, and forever maintain revolutionary youth.

    为人民做一辈子好事
    解放军广州部队　高里
    毛主席说：“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，一贯地有益于广大群众，一贯地有益于青年，一贯地有益于革命，艰苦奋斗几十年如一日，这才是最难最难的呵！”我跟党、跟毛主席闹了二十多年革命，可以说做过些好事。但是，怎样才能一辈子做好事呢？怎样才能保持晚节，将革命进行到底呢？近两年来，我从学习毛主席著作和参加阶级斗争实践过程中，开始找到了开这把锁的“金钥匙”，那就是要用“老三篇”在自己灵魂深处闹革命，灭资兴无，改造世界观，促进思想革命化。
  身体越差，越要保持
    旺盛的革命干劲
    我负过重伤，患过肺炎、肝病和长期神经衰弱症。一九六四年秋，正当部队执行任务的紧张阶段，我的病却越来越重，身体越来越坏。面对着这种情况，我重温了《为人民服务》，毛泽东思想给我增添了无穷的力量。
    毛主席说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”这使我进一步认识到，一个革命者为伟大而艰巨的共产主义事业奋斗，就要随时准备作出牺牲。下定决心，活着就干，死了就算。
    当时，战备任务比较繁重，我就一面抓政治思想工作，提高部队斗志，一面抓阵地调整，兵器部署；白天深入现场指导，晚上坚持战备值班。有一次，我在战斗值班的时候，正打着电话就晕过去了。醒来以后，同志们劝我回去休息。我想，这是在战斗，一个指挥员在这关键时刻怎么能离开自己的岗位呢？我用冷水浇浇头，又继续工作。
    同志们经常关心我的身体健康。我想身体固然是革命的本钱，但革命是身体的灵魂！如果一个人光有健壮的身体，不革命，岂不成了一具“木乃伊”？过去，无数革命先烈抛头颅，洒热血，在所不惜，今天自己有点小伤小痛，还有什么考虑的。
    去年秋天，我的身体状况更坏了，领导上要我去住医院。我在去医院途中，听说部队大批干部要到农村参加“四清”运动，我就从半路转回部队坚决要求恢复工作。后来领导上又确定要我休息一年。在疗养院我反复看了“老三篇”，心想，部队工作那么繁重，我能闲着休息吗？不能。我终于争取提早出了院。
    可是，刚回到部队，组织上为了让我彻底养好身体，命令我离职休养。听了这个决定，我从内心感激党对我的关怀，但又想怎能吃着人民的给养，耽在家里泡？回到家里，我又翻开“老三篇”，毛主席指出，一个人的能力有大小，但是只要有毫无自私自利之心的精神，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。我想，一个人的体质有强弱，病情有轻重，但是毫无自私自利之心的精神不可少。组织上为了爱护干部，让我去休养，但我绝不能有放弃工作保存自己的想法。特别是学习了毛主席的好学生——焦裕禄的光辉事迹后，更有感触。心想，一个革命者的职务是可以交班的，但是革命的工作要有一分热发一分光。我积极主动争取做一些力所能及的事。每当我参加一项具体活动后，心里就有一股说不出的高兴劲，因为我为人民又尽了一点应尽的义务。
    经过这几年与疾病的斗争，我深深体会到：肉体上的慢性病并不可怕，它最多只能毁灭我的躯体，不能毁灭我的革命意志；可怕的是思想上的慢性病，在和平环境中，在较好的生活条件下，养尊处优，斗志衰退，贪生怕死，苟且偷安，无所作为，那才是最危险的。
    职务越高，越要保持普通一兵的本色
    我在部队担任领导工作以后，就渐渐地滋长起“官气”，不知不觉地有了“官”架子。遇到不顺心的事，说话嗓门很粗，看到不顺眼的事，火气更大，有时甚至拍桌子。过去常以脾气不好、修养差为借口，原谅自己。一九五九年整风的时候，群众给我贴了不少大字报，这时我才警惕起来。毛主席指出：“很多人对于官兵关系、军民关系弄不好，以为是方法不对，我总告诉他们是根本态度（或根本宗旨）问题，这态度就是尊重士兵和尊重人民。”我认识到过去不是方式方法问题，而是根本态度问题，忘记了自己是群众中的一员，忘记了自己和战士一样，都是人民的勤务员。我决心进一步按照毛主席的教导去改正自己的缺点。
    首先，我把自己看作是战士的勤务员，把干部、战士看作是自己的阶级兄弟和亲密战友，把连队看作是领导干部工作的基点，以满腔热忱深入群众，联系群众，并从政治上和生活上去关怀每个同志。
    毛主席说：“我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”又说：“共产党员在民众运动中，应该是民众的朋友，而不是民众的上司，是诲人不倦的教师，而不是官僚主义的政客。”在日常工作和生活中，我处处注意平等待人，遇有问题，耐心说服，以理服人。我部有一位干部有些骄傲自大，听不进批评。我想：虽然他有缺点，但他是贫农出身的革命同志，只要我们怀着深厚的阶级感情去帮助他，用毛泽东思想武装他，不会红不起来。于是，我主动找他一起学习，一起谈心。现在他积极学习毛主席著作，有了很大进步。这个事实，给了我深刻的教育，一个领导干部，“官”气越大，战士离你越远；“官”气越小，战士靠你越近；“官”气去掉，战士跟你心连心。
    另一方面，我也注意从生活上关心每个同志。我每次下连队，都注意给连队做些有益的事情。通过这些实践活动，领导和基层干部、战士的感情就更加融洽了。
    其次，在思想上要不断与“官”字斗，防止“特殊感”，在行动上也要处处以普通劳动者的姿态出现，做一个名副其实的人民勤务员。
    毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，……”。我想，既然是人民的勤务员，就只有搞好工作的义务，没有要求特殊照顾的权利。因此，每到一个连队，我就注意和战士们打成一片。战士学习我也学习，战士挑粪我也挑粪，战士修阵地我也修阵地。晚上连队干部查铺查哨，我也参加。并在生活细节上约束自己，不搞特殊化。在连队和出差途中，我尽量和同志们住在一起，便于谈心，谈工作。在节日假日，我经常去看望战士，和大伙谈心，搞文娱活动，讲故事，有时还替战士站岗放哨，让战士去看电影，欢度假日。以上种种，看来都是些小事，但想到毛主席教导说：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”觉得这样做意义就大了。它不仅保持了我军的光荣传统，还有利于促进自己和部队的思想革命化。
    在同“官”字斗争的过程中，我深深体会到：一个领导干部，不论在什么岗位上，都应该是人民的勤务员，胸中一定要随时装着部队的全体同志，对他们要有一颗火热的心，才能真正联系群众。
    我用“老三篇”来解决自己下半辈子如何革命，如何做人的问题，还仅仅是开始。我坚决响应林彪同志的号召，决心干一辈子革命，学一辈子“老三篇”，促进自己思想革命化，永葆革命青春。
