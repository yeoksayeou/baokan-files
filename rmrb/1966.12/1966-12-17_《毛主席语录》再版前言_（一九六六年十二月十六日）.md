Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new and higher stage.

Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era in which imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is marching towards worldwide victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and dogmatism. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the entire Party, the entire army, and all the people of the nation.

Therefore, it is the most fundamental task of our Party's political and ideological work to forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to arm the minds of all the people of the nation with Mao Zedong Thought, and to ensure that Mao Zedong Thought guides all our work. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the broad ranks of revolutionary cadres, and the broad ranks of intellectuals must all truly master Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and become good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

In studying the works of Chairman Mao, one must study with problems in mind, applying what one learns actively and practically, combining learning with application, learning what is urgently needed first, seeing immediate results, and concentrating on the "application" aspect. To truly master Mao Zedong Thought, one must repeatedly study Chairman Mao's fundamental viewpoints. Some of his aphorisms should be memorized and repeatedly applied. Newspapers should frequently publish Chairman Mao's quotations in conjunction with actual conditions, for the study and application of the masses. The experience of the masses in the past few years in actively applying Chairman Mao's works has shown that studying Chairman Mao's quotations with problems in mind is a good method for studying Mao Zedong Thought and can produce immediate results.

To help the broad masses better study Mao Zedong Thought, we have compiled this book of "Chairman Mao's Quotations." Each unit should, when organizing study, combine it with the current situation, tasks, the ideological situation of the masses, and work situation, and select relevant content for study.

Now, our great motherland is entering a new era in which workers, peasants, and soldiers master Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. When Mao Zedong Thought is mastered by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force and a spiritual atomic bomb of boundless power. The mass publication of "Chairman Mao's Quotations" is a crucial measure for the broad masses to master Mao Zedong Thought and promote the ideological revolution of our people. I hope that every comrade will study diligently and earnestly, and that a new high tide of actively applying Chairman Mao's works will surge across the nation. Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, let us strive to build our country into a great socialist country that possesses modern agriculture, modern industry, modern science and culture, and modern national defense!

    《毛主席语录》再版前言
    （一九六六年十二月十六日）
    林彪
    毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。
    毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。
    因此，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想武装全国人民的头脑，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅，是我党政治思想工作最根本的任务。广大工农兵群众、广大革命干部和广大知识分子，都必须把毛泽东思想真正学到手，做到人人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在“用”字上狠下功夫。为了把毛泽东思想真正学到手，要反复学习毛主席的许多基本观点，有些警句最好要背熟，反复学习，反复运用。在报纸上，要经常结合实际，刊登毛主席的语录，供大家学习和运用。几年来广大群众活学活用毛主席著作的经验，证明带着问题选学毛主席的语录，是一种学习毛泽东思想的好方法，容易收到立竿见影的效果。
    为了帮助广大群众更好地学习毛泽东思想，我们选编了这本《毛主席语录》。各单位在组织学习的时候，应当结合形势、任务、群众的思想情况和工作情况，选学有关的内容。
    现在我们伟大的祖国，正在出现一个工农兵掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的新时代。毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。《毛主席语录》的大量出版，对广大群众掌握毛泽东思想，推动我国人民思想革命化，是一个极为重要的措施。希望每个同志认真地、刻苦地学习，在全国范围内，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，为把我国建设成为一个具有现代农业，现代工业，现代科学文化和现代国防的伟大社会主义国家而奋斗！
