Mao Zedong said: "Those who are determined to be led by the nose by U.S. imperialism will ultimately become sacrificial offerings for U.S. imperialism."

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on December 7th: Tokyo, Japan. U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk visited Japan from December 5th to 7th and held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato. This is Rusk's second visit to Tokyo in half a year, following his visit in July.

According to reports, during his talks with Sato, Rusk exchanged views on the situation in Vietnam and Asia, and discussed the issue of "bombing for peace" against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Sato expressed support for the U.S. "peace talks" plot. They also discussed China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's nuclear test, the so-called prevention of nuclear proliferation, and obstructing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legal seat in the United Nations. They both expressed "satisfaction" with the recent UN General Assembly vote to keep China out of the United Nations. Rusk's visit was obviously to complete the mission left unfinished by Johnson at the Manila conference.

Rusk rushed to Tokyo on the third day of Sato's third cabinet reshuffle, reflecting the close collaboration between the U.S. and Japanese reactionary governments in their joint efforts to invade Vietnam and oppose China. During the talks, Rusk provided Sato with what he claimed to be "firsthand information" about China. Sato assured Rusk: "Despite the cabinet reshuffle, Japan's close alliance policy with the United States remains unchanged." Sato also expressed his willingness to further assist the United States in its nuclear strategy in Asia.

Rusk left Tokyo for Taiwan on the morning of December 7th and will then proceed to South Vietnam and Thailand.

    美日反动派加紧勾结侵越反华
    腊斯克又到日本同佐藤进行密商
    毛主席说：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”
    据新华社七日讯　东京消息：美国国务卿腊斯克五日到七日访问了日本，同日本首相佐藤荣作举行了会谈。这是腊斯克继七月访日之后半年内第二次到东京活动。
    据报道，腊斯克在同佐藤会谈时，就越南和亚洲局势交换了意见，并谈到对越南民主共和国的“以炸迫和”的问题。佐藤对美国的“和谈”阴谋表示支持。他们还讨论了中国的无产阶级文化大革命、中国核爆炸和所谓防止核扩散以及阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位问题，并对最近联大表决把中国关在联合国外的结果互相表示“满意”。腊斯克此行显然是为了完成约翰逊在马尼拉会议后所未完成的访日使命。
    腊斯克在佐藤内阁第三次改组的第三天就迫不及待地闯进了东京，反映了美日反动当局在侵越反华的相互勾结方面，紧密到何种程度。在会谈中，腊斯克向佐藤说明了关于中国的所谓“第一手消息”。佐藤向腊斯克保证：“尽管内阁进行了改组，日本同美国密切的联盟政策仍然不变”。佐藤还表示要进一步帮助美国在亚洲的核战略体制。
    腊斯克已经在七日上午离东京去台湾活动，然后还要去南越和泰国。
