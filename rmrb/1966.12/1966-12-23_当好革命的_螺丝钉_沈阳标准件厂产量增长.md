The revolutionary workers of the Shenyang Standard Parts Factory have followed Chairman Mao's teachings on considering the overall situation, starting from the interests of the whole, and taking pride in being a good "screw" for the revolution. They have created conditions for thousands of brother factories across the nation to complete their plans. This factory has already completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment. The total production volume has increased significantly compared to last year, and the product quality has been notably improved.

The Shenyang Standard Parts Factory is one of the largest standard parts factories in the country. It produces several billion screws and other components annually, supplying more than two thousand brother factories nationwide.
