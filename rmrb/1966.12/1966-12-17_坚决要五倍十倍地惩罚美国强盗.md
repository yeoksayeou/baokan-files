The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam condemns the U.S. imperialists for sending aircraft to continuously bomb the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi. The Front vows to punish the American aggressors fivefold and tenfold. No matter how much the U.S. imperialists escalate and expand their aggression, no matter how long and arduous the struggle, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of the North and defeat the American aggressors and their traitorous lackeys.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, December 16 — According to a broadcast by the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on December 15 strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists for sending aircraft to continuously bomb the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi. The statement vows that the people of South Vietnam will punish the enemy fivefold and tenfold and are determined to defeat the new strategic counteroffensive of U.S. imperialism, achieving greater victories.

	The statement said that to save itself from the predicament in the Vietnam War, U.S. imperialism has escalated the war against the North, using its air force to indiscriminately bomb the capital, Hanoi, even attacking the area of foreign embassies.

	The statement said that this is a very serious new escalation, an unprovoked and arrogant provocation against the Vietnamese people and the peace-loving and justice-seeking people and governments of the world.

	The statement said that the U.S. bombing of Hanoi will only make the entire Vietnamese people more deeply remember the bloody crimes of the American aggressors, arouse stronger hatred, and make the entire nation more united and determined to defeat the common enemy of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world — the American aggressors. The statement angrily condemns the despicable war actions of U.S. imperialism, demanding that it immediately and unconditionally stop bombing North Vietnam, immediately withdraw U.S. troops and its mercenaries from the South, and respect the sacred national rights of the Vietnamese people. The U.S. government must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused by its military adventurism.

	The statement expresses the belief that the progressive people of the world, including the American people, will recognize the intentions of the U.S. in escalating and expanding the war of aggression, and take timely and effective measures to stop the most barbaric crimes of U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people, firmly supporting the position stated in the statement issued by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 14.

	The statement said: The great sacrifices made by the people of the North in countering the destructive war of the American aggressors fully demonstrate the deep feelings of the people in the rear for the frontline soldiers. "The people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam express their fraternal feelings to the 17 million compatriots in the North, standing shoulder to shoulder with the people of the North at all times, willing to make the greatest contributions. No matter what sacrifices we have to endure, no matter how much the U.S. imperialists escalate and expand their aggression, no matter how long and arduous the struggle, we will defeat the American aggressors and their traitorous lackeys."

	The statement said that the people of the South are already prepared, and if the U.S. imperialists attack the North, they will make the aggressors pay fivefold and tenfold for their crimes, giving the criminals the punishment they deserve. The more the U.S. imperialists continue down the path of aggression, the heavier the blows they will suffer on all battlefields in the South and the North, and they will inevitably meet their final defeat.

	The statement warns the warmongering clique of the U.S.: They cannot even defeat the 14 million people of the South, so how can they defeat the 30 million Vietnamese people who are united, determined to fight to the end, bound by blood, filled with deep hatred, and who love their country dearly, willing to sacrifice everything rather than be slaves?

	The statement calls on the people of the South to recognize the situation, firmly carry forward the brilliant victories achieved in the initial period of the winter-spring offensive, and be determined to charge forward, defeat the new strategic counteroffensive of the U.S.-puppet clique, advance bravely, achieve greater victories, and avenge the compatriots of the North and South and the people of Hanoi who have been killed by U.S. imperialism! The statement said that there is nothing more precious than independence and freedom. The people of South Vietnam are determined to fulfill their sacred duty, thoroughly defeat the aggressive war of U.S. imperialism, liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the country, contributing to the maintenance of peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

    南越民族解放阵线发表声明怒斥美帝轰炸河内
    坚决要五倍十倍地惩罚美国强盗
    无论美帝国主义把侵略战争加强和扩大到什么程度，无论多么长期和艰苦，也要同北方军民并肩在一起，战胜美国侵略强盗及其卖国走狗。
    新华社河内十六日电　据越南南方解放电台广播，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团，十五日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义派遣飞机连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内的滔天罪行。声明表示，越南南方军民要五倍、十倍的惩罚敌人，决心打败美帝国主义新的战略反攻，夺取更大的胜利。
    声明说，为了挽救在侵越战争中的困境，美帝国主义对北方继续进行战争“升级”，用空军滥肆轰炸首都河内，连外国使馆区也遭到了袭击。
    声明说，这是极其严重的一次新“升级”，是对越南人民和世界爱好和平、主持正义的各国人民和政府的一种不可饶恕的蛮横挑衅。
    声明说，美帝国主义轰炸河内市，只能使越南全国人民更加深刻地牢记美国强盗的血腥罪行，更加激起强烈的仇恨，使整个民族更加团结一致，更加加强战胜越南人民和世界人民不共戴天的敌人——美国侵略强盗的决心。声明愤怒谴责美帝国主义的卑鄙的战争行动，要求它必须立即无条件地停止对越南北方的轰炸，立即从南方撤出美国军队和它的帮凶军，尊重越南人民的神圣的民族权利。美国政府必须对由它所采取的军事冒险行动而造成的严重后果，承担全部责任。
    声明表示深信，包括美国人民在内的世界进步人民，必定认清美国在加强扩大侵略战争中的意图，从而采取及时和有效的措施，以制止美帝国主义对越南人民的最野蛮的罪行，坚决支持越南民主共和国政府十二月十四日发表的声明中所阐明的立场。
    声明说：北方军民在反击美国强盗的破坏性战争中所作出的巨大牺牲，充分体现了大后方的同胞对前线军民的深厚情感。“越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线向一千七百万北方同胞表达骨肉兄弟的情感，时刻同北方军民并肩在一起，愿意作出最大的贡献。无论要忍受任何牺牲，无论美帝国主义把侵略战争加强和扩大到什么程度，无论多么长期和艰苦，也要战胜美国侵略强盗及其卖国走狗。”
    声明说，南方军民已经作好了准备，如果美帝国主义袭击北方，就坚决要它五倍、十倍地偿还血债，以便给予罪恶的制造者以应得的惩罚。美帝国主义越是沿着侵略战争的道路走下去，就会在南方和北方的所有战场上遭到越沉重的打击，无论如何也避免不了最后的失败。
    声明警告美国好战集团说：它连一千四百万南方人民都战胜不了，又怎么能够战胜团结一致、决战决胜、骨肉相连，怀着高度仇恨，怀着对祖国的无限热爱，宁愿牺牲一切也不肯做奴隶的三千多万越南人民呢？
    声明号召南方军民，认清形势，坚决发扬在冬春季初期取得的辉煌胜利，决心冲锋陷阵，打败美伪集团的新的战略反攻，勇往直前，夺取更大的胜利，为惨遭美帝国主义杀害的南北两方同胞和首都河内市同胞报仇！声明说，没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。越南南方人民决心完成自己的神圣义务，彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，以解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国，为维护东南亚和世界和平作出贡献。
