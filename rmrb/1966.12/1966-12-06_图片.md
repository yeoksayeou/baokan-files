Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee of victory. The words of Chairman Mao have boosted the confidence and courage of the crew of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, enabling them to dare to struggle and dare to win in the face of difficulties. Before setting out, the locomotive driver, Cai Lianxing (right), and the young driver, Chen Fuhan, together write a board with Chairman Mao's quotations, which is hung in the driver's cabin.
