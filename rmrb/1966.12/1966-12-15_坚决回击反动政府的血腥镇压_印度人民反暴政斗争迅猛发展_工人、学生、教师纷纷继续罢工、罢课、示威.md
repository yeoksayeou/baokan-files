New Delhi, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) — The struggle of Indian teachers, students, and workers for survival and against tyranny continues to surge forward. They are responding with more resolute struggle to the reactionary Indian government's bloody suppression.

The reactionary authorities' brutal suppression of teachers demonstrating in Uttar Pradesh on Dec. 5 has sparked a larger-scale struggle wave among teachers in the state. On Dec. 11, more than 80,000 middle school teachers held demonstrations in various counties within the state to protest the government's brutal suppression. They demanded the unconditional release of teachers who were arbitrarily arrested. The Uttar Pradesh Middle School Teachers Association also issued a statement on Dec. 11, declaring their determination to continue the struggle and demanding the release of their colleagues.

According to reports, teachers detained in the Lucknow prison in Uttar Pradesh went on a hunger strike on the evening of Dec. 11 to protest the Bihar state reactionary government's dispatch of police to open fire and kill a professor and a student in Muzaffarpur.

The irregular strikes by Uttar Pradesh government employees and bus workers are still continuing.

The bloody incident on Dec. 10 in Muzaffarpur, where the Bihar state reactionary government killed a professor and a student, has aroused immense anger among students in the state. Four student organizations called for a statewide student strike to protest the police suppression. The struggle for survival and against tyranny quickly spread to other towns in the state on Dec. 11 and 12. Tens of thousands of students, wearing black armbands and carrying black flags, held demonstrations, strongly condemning the reactionary government's atrocities. The reactionary authorities continued to suppress the students, raiding student dormitories, arresting more than a hundred people, and closing all schools in the state.

In Calcutta, following the anti-persecution struggle wave launched by students on Dec. 8, 11,000 tram workers went on an irregular strike on Dec. 12 to demand wage increases. On Dec. 13, 14,000 bus workers also went on an irregular strike. According to the Indian News Agency, Calcutta is expected to see strikes by more than 100,000 workers.
