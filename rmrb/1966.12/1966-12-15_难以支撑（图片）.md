The current situation is extremely grave. The enemy is becoming more cunning and vicious in their attempts to sabotage our revolution. They are using various means to spread rumors, create chaos, and undermine our unity. We must remain vigilant and resolute in the face of these challenges.

The reactionary forces are trying to exploit the weaknesses in our ranks. They are attempting to divide us, to sow discord, and to weaken our resolve. We must not allow them to succeed. We must stand united, strengthen our ideological education, and deepen our class struggle.

The revolutionary masses must be mobilized to expose and criticize the enemy's schemes. We must not be afraid of their tricks and plots. We must be brave and determined in our struggle against them. The enemy is strong, but we are stronger. We have the support of the people, and we have the truth on our side.

We must also pay attention to our own shortcomings and mistakes. We must be self-critical and correct our errors. Only by doing so can we truly advance our revolution and build a stronger, more united front against the enemy.

In this critical moment, we must remember the teachings of Chairman Mao. We must follow his guidance and lead our people to victory. Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live the great Communist Party of China! Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!
