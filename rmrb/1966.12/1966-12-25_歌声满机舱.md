Once, a Japanese sports delegation boarded a plane from Beijing to Shanghai. As soon as these Japanese friends got on the plane, they enthusiastically sang "The East Is Red." Not only did they sing themselves, but they also organized all the passengers to sing along.

After everyone finished singing, a Japanese friend voluntarily sang "The East Is Red" solo. After finishing, he enthusiastically shouted, "Long live the great unity of the Chinese and Japanese peoples!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" At this moment, all the passengers also raised their arms together with him and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

The Japanese delegation friends became more and more enthusiastic. They held "Quotations from Chairman Mao" above their heads, sometimes singing "The East Is Red," sometimes shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" The entire cabin was filled with songs, overflowing with boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao.

    歌声满机舱
    一次，一个日本体育代表队乘班机从北京去上海。这些日本朋友一上飞机，就热情地高唱《东方红》。他们不仅自己唱，还组织全体旅客一起唱。
    大家唱完了，一位日本朋友又主动独唱《东方红》，唱完后高呼：“中日人民友好大团结万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”这时，全体旅客也同他一起振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    日本代表队的朋友们情绪越来越热烈了。他们把《毛主席语录》顶在头上，一会儿高唱《东方红》，一会儿高呼“毛主席万岁！”整个机舱歌声回荡，洋溢着对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱之情。
