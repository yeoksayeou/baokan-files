Chairman Mao said: "We must break the routine, adopt advanced technology as much as possible, and build our country into a modernized socialist power in a not too long historical period. The great leap forward we are talking about is exactly this. Is this impossible? Is it just boasting or bluffing? No, it is possible. It is neither boasting nor bluffing. Just look at our history and you will know."

The news of China's successful new nuclear test reached Hanoi, and the heroic Vietnamese military and civilians warmly celebrated the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. They regard this new victory of the Chinese people as a powerful support for their struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

From the morning of the 29th to the evening, many Vietnamese comrades and overseas Chinese flocked to the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam and the Xinhua News Agency's Hanoi branch to express their warmest congratulations.

More than 120 workers in a workshop of the Thang Long Cigarette Factory cheered and applauded enthusiastically when they heard the news of China's successful new nuclear test broadcast over the loudspeaker. The party secretary of the factory, Deng Si Cao, said: "This new victory of China is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a heavy blow to American imperialism. American imperialism is very afraid, and we are very happy." The machine operator Nguyen Vu Be said excitedly: "China has successfully conducted a new nuclear test again, breaking the nuclear monopoly of American imperialism. This brings great encouragement to the Vietnamese people. We regard this new victory as our own. With a close ally like China that possesses nuclear weapons, our confidence is stronger. We will continue to carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism and resolutely carry the struggle against American aggression for national salvation to the end."

Under the cold wind, the militia self-defense team members of the Vietnam-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative, Le Van Nha, Vu Thi Loi, and Nguyen Thi Huong, stood guard at the machine gun position, vigilantly watching the sky, and excitedly listened to the joyous news broadcast from the nearby loudspeaker. They said: China successfully conducted three nuclear tests this year, proving that China's national defense is powerful, strongly encouraging us, and strengthening our determination to defeat the American aggressors. The soldiers of a certain artillery battalion, who shot down two American aggressor planes in the battle to defend the heroic capital Hanoi on December 14, ran to tell each other the news of China's successful new nuclear test, their faces beaming with joy. They repeatedly asked the Xinhua News Agency reporter visiting their battalion to convey their greetings to the great leader Chairman Mao and sincerely wished Chairman Mao longevity.

    毛主席说：“我们必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术，在一个不太长的历史时期内，把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化的强国。我们所说的大跃进，就是这个意思。难道这是做不到的吗？是吹牛皮、放大炮吗？不，是做得到的。既不是吹牛皮，也不是放大炮。只要看我们的历史就可以知道了。”
    越南军民热烈欢呼我国成功地进行新的核爆炸
    中国的胜利增强了我们打败美帝的决心
    据新华社河内二十九日电　本社记者报道：中国又一次成功地进行新的核爆炸的喜讯传到河内以后，英雄的越南军民欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，他们把中国人民这一新的胜利，看作是对他们抗美救国斗争的最有力支持。
    从二十九日清晨到傍晚，许多越南同志和华侨纷纷赶到中国驻越南大使馆和新华社河内分社表示最热烈的祝贺。
    升龙卷烟厂某车间的一百二十多名工人在听到有线广播喇叭里传出中国又成功地进行了新的核爆炸的喜讯时，都不约而同地热烈鼓掌，欢呼这一伟大的胜利。这个厂的党委书记邓士操说：“中国这一新的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是对美帝国主义的沉重打击。美帝国主义非常害怕，我们感到非常高兴。”机电工人阮友贝兴高采烈地说：“中国又一次成功地进行新的核爆炸，打破了美帝国主义的核垄断。给我们越南人民带来了巨大的鼓舞。我们把这一新的胜利看作是自己的胜利。我们身边有着掌握了核武器的中国这样的亲密战友，信心更强了，我们要继续发扬革命英雄主义精神，决心把抗美救国斗争进行到底。”
    冒着寒风坚守在机枪阵地上的越中友好农业社的民兵自卫队员梁文雅、武氏累和阮氏向，一面警惕地注视着天空，一面兴奋地倾听从附近广播喇叭中传出的这一喜讯。他们说：中国在今年一年内成功地进行三次核试验，证明了中国的国防力量强大，强有力地鼓舞着我们，增强我们打败美国侵略强盗的决心。在十二月十四日保卫英雄首都河内的战斗中一举击落美国强盗飞机两架的高射炮部队某连的战士们，在听到了中国又成功地进行了新的核爆炸的消息后，奔走相告，喜上眉梢。他们激动地一再请在他们连队访问的新华社记者转达他们对伟大领袖毛主席的问候，并衷心祝毛主席万寿无疆。
