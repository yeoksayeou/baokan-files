	Preparatory Political Mobilization Before Marching
	Editor's Note: The People's Liberation Army is a people's army created by Chairman Mao. This army is skilled in marching and fighting, invincible in all directions. In the past, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, using the two feet of each person, crossed snow-capped mountains and grasslands, creating a "25,000-li Long March," overcoming countless difficulties and hardships, and achieving a miracle unparalleled in ancient and modern Chinese and world military history.

	In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary youth and Red Guards enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to learn from the People's Liberation Army and become the strong reserve force of the army. Many revolutionary youths, taking the Red Army as an example, used their two feet to conduct a Long March-style full-distance foot march. This is a new phenomenon that emerged during the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, a new creation by revolutionary youths. Our great leader Chairman Mao actively supports and praises the revolutionary actions of these revolutionary youths. Now, many revolutionary youths are conducting trial foot marches, preparing to fully launch full-distance foot marches in the spring of next year. To help revolutionary youths march better and gain greater tempering during the full-distance foot march, we will briefly introduce the rich political work experience accumulated by the People's Liberation Army over a long period, for everyone's reference.

	Revolutionary youths have not marched like the troops in the past, and they will inevitably encounter many difficulties during the foot march. To gain experience, it is best to first conduct short-distance foot marches, then long-distance full marches; first conduct foot marches within the province or region, then to other provinces and regions; first walk on major transportation routes, then on remote mountain areas. Places without people should not be chosen for the Long March. Because revolutionary youths conduct full-distance foot marches, not only to temper revolutionary will and marching ability, but also to better contact society, contact the masses, learn from the working-class and peasant masses, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the Sixteen Points. Walking in places with many people and villages is convenient for achieving the above purposes and also convenient for solving food and accommodation problems.

	Dear Red Guards and dear revolutionary youths: You are now preparing for the Long March-style full-distance foot march next spring. To help everyone do a better and more thorough job of preparation, we will introduce some political work experiences of the People's Liberation Army units during marches.

	Everyone knows that the People's Liberation Army is famous worldwide for its marching and fighting skills. In the past revolutionary war period, the troops almost marched and fought every day, walking seventy to eighty li, or even a hundred li, without batting an eye. Sometimes, to seize the opportunity for battle and pursue and annihilate the enemy, the troops would march and fight continuously for days and nights without rest. Sometimes, our army would suddenly appear in front of the enemy, striking fear into their hearts. This high level of marching mobility ensured that the troops could not be worn down or broken in any difficult and harsh conditions. In peacetime, the troops also paid special attention to training their marching abilities during military training, producing many "iron feet" and "flying legs" and "hard bones."

	Why can the People's Liberation Army endure great hardships and labor, having such strong marching abilities? The most fundamental reason is relying on firm political thought work, emphasizing politics, and emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought. This firm political thought work runs through the entire process and every link of marching.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Do not fight unprepared battles, do not fight battles without certainty." Fighting is like this, and marching is also like this. In the past, there was a saying: "When the army moves, provisions must be sent first." Now it should be said: "When the army moves, thoughts must be sent first." To ensure the smooth completion of the marching task, thorough and detailed political mobilization work must be done before marching, so that all personnel have high political morale and vigorous fighting spirit, and are prepared to endure hardships, labor, and march and fight continuously. Only when thoughts are firm, can marching and fighting truly be firm. For example: In the winter of 1962, the border defense troops of the People's Liberation Army, during the self-defense counterattack on the Sino-Indian border, often marched and fought in snow-capped mountains and gorges where few people had set foot. The political work of the troops was done very thoroughly and timely. A certain company's Seventh Platoon, in a counterattack, was tasked with a flanking and blocking mission. The troops had not rested for two days and a night, and had to cross two mountains and two icy rivers along the way. Facing this situation, the platoon conducted thorough political mobilization before marching, explaining the importance of quickly completing the flanking and encirclement mission. The cadres and soldiers were all in high spirits and full of fighting spirit. When they encountered icy rivers, they immediately took off their cotton pants and waded across. Many people's legs and feet were cut by ice blocks, and the mountain roads were rough and difficult to walk, but the cadres and soldiers all advanced bravely with astonishing willpower, and not a single person fell behind. This shows that thorough political mobilization before marching is very important.

	The political mobilization work before marching, generally speaking, should be done deeply and thoroughly in several aspects.

	First, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fundamentally raise the class consciousness of all personnel and the high awareness and political enthusiasm of cadres and soldiers in marching training. To achieve this, it is necessary to link the domestic and international situation, and clearly explain to all personnel the purpose and political significance of the troops' marching and fighting, so that every soldier knows why they are marching and why they are fighting. When soldiers' class consciousness is raised and they understand the intentions of their superiors, their thoughts are unified, and in any difficult and harsh situation, they can make up their minds, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory. In 1962, the Kuomintang bandits, under the instigation of the U.S. imperialists, attempted to invade our mainland. When the PLA troops advanced to the southeast coast, they linked the domestic and international situation at that time, explaining to the cadres and soldiers the great political significance of smashing the evil plots of the U.S. and Kuomintang bandits and defending the socialist mountains and rivers of our motherland. At the same time, they organized cadres and soldiers to denounce the crimes of the U.S. and the Kuomintang bandits, arousing their class consciousness and class hatred. The troops were always in high spirits and full of fighting spirit, successfully completing the marching task.

	To educate the troops to carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army of enduring hardships, laboring hard, fighting bravely, and struggling hard, the platoons all pay attention to conducting revolutionary heroism education before marching, arousing the troops' sense of honor. Many platoons, during the marching mobilization, invite old Red Army soldiers to introduce the heroic deeds of the Red Army in the 25,000-li Long March, climbing snow-capped mountains, crossing grasslands, eating tree bark, and swallowing grass roots, overcoming countless difficulties. They invite heroes and model figures to tell stories of past marching and fighting. A certain unit of the PLA, before conducting a field march, specially organized cadres and soldiers to study the revolutionary war memoirs of seizing the Luding Bridge and crossing the Dadu River, and the deeds of the "Hard-Bone Sixth Platoon" and the "Hard Eighth Platoon on the Karakoram Mountains." This greatly enhanced the troops' confidence in overcoming all difficulties and completing the marching task. The soldiers said: "The revolutionary forerunners, for the victory of the revolution, were not afraid of any difficulties, what is there to fear in walking a few hundred li!"

	To do a good job of political mobilization before marching, it is also necessary to pay special attention to grasping the active thoughts, doing thought work for every individual. Many platoons conduct thorough investigations and research before marching, hold new and old soldiers' symposiums, understand the soldiers' thoughts, and then, based on the different active thoughts of various personnel, conduct targeted thought education. For example, some soldiers are afraid of hardships and fatigue, so they organize them to study Chairman Mao's expositions on strategically despising difficulties and tactically valuing difficulties, and articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Some comrades often have high spirits at the beginning of the march, but when they encounter difficulties, their feet blister, or they become overly fatigued from continuous marching, their spirits drop, lacking the spirit of perseverance. This requires doing thought work in advance, so that everyone is fully prepared to overcome various difficulties, and in the face of any difficulty, they possess the heroic spirit of "defeating all enemies and never being subdued by the enemy."

	While conducting thorough political mobilization, it is also necessary to do a good job of organizational and material preparations. Only when the preparations are done well can the marching task be successfully completed.

    行军前的思想动员工作
    编者按：人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的一支人民的军队。这支军队能走善打，所向无敌。当年，中国工农红军开动每人的两只脚，爬雪山，过草地，“铁流两万五千里”，战胜了数不尽的艰难险阻，创造了古今中外战史上未曾有过的奇迹。
    在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，革命青少年和红卫兵小将们，热烈响应毛主席的号召，向解放军学习，作解放军的坚强后备军。许多革命小将，以红军为榜样，开动两只脚，进行了长征式的全程徒步串连。这是在文化大革命的高潮中涌现出来的新事物，是革命小将的新创造。我们伟大领袖毛主席积极支持和赞扬革命小将们这种革命行动。现在，许多革命小将正在进行步行串连试点，准备明年春天全面开展全程徒步串连活动。为了帮助革命小将们在全程徒步串连时，走得更好，得到更大的锻炼，我们把人民解放军长期积累起来的丰富的行军政治工作经验，作一概略的介绍，供大家参考。
    革命小将们，过去没有像部队那样行过军，在徒步串连时，必然会遇到许多困难。为了取得经验，最好先进行短距离的步行串连，再搞长距离的全程长征；先在本省、本地区进行徒步串连，再到外省和其他地区串连；先走交通要道，再走偏僻山区。没有人烟的地方，最好不要去长征。因为革命小将们进行全程徒步串连，不光是为了锻炼革命意志和行军能力，还要更好地接触社会，接触群众，向工农群众学习，宣传毛泽东思想，宣传十六条。走人口多，村镇多的地方，便于实现上述目的，也便于解决食宿等问题。
    亲爱的红卫兵战士们，亲爱的革命小将们：你们现在正在为明年春天进行长征式全程步行串连做准备。为了帮助大家把准备工作做得更好，更充分，我们将陆续介绍一些人民解放军连队的行军政治工作经验。
    大家知道，人民解放军能走善打，是举世闻名的。在过去革命战争时期，部队几乎天天行军打仗，每天走上七十里、八十里，甚至百把里路，都不在话下。有时为了捕捉战机，追歼敌人，几天几夜不睡觉不休息，连续行军，连续战斗。有时我军会突然出现在敌人面前，使敌人闻风丧胆。这种高度的行军机动能力，保证了部队在任何艰难困苦的情况下，都拖不垮，打不烂。平时，部队进行军事训练，也特别注意锻炼部队的行军能力，练出了很多“铁脚板”、“飞毛腿”和“硬骨头”。
    人民解放军为什么能够吃大苦，耐大劳，有这样强的行军能力呢？最根本的一条，就是靠坚强的政治思想工作，靠突出政治，靠突出毛泽东思想。这种坚强的政治思想工作，贯串在行军的全过程和每一个环节。
    毛主席教导我们说：“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗。”打仗是这样，行军也是这样。过去有一句俗话，叫做“兵马未动，粮草先行”。现在应该说是：“兵马未动，思想先行”。要保证行军任务的圆满完成，行军前一定要做好深入细致的思想动员工作，使全体人员具有饱满的政治情绪和旺盛的战斗意志，具有吃大苦，耐大劳，连续行军连续作战的思想准备。只有思想过得硬，行军作战才能真正过得硬。举个例子来说：一九六二年冬天，人民解放军边防部队，在中印边境自卫反击作战中，经常在人迹罕到的雪山和峡谷地区行军作战。部队的政治工作做得非常充分、非常及时。某部七连在一次反击战中，担任迂回阻击任务。部队已经两天一夜没有得到休息了，沿途要翻过两座大山，过两条冰河。面对这种情况，在行军前，连里进行了深入的思想动员工作，讲清了迅速完成迂回包围任务的重要意义。干部战士人人情绪饱满，斗志昂扬。一遇到冰河，就毫不迟疑地脱下棉裤，趟过河去。不少人的腿脚被冰块划破，山路又崎岖难行，但是干部战士都以惊人的毅力奋勇前进，全连没有一人掉队。由此可见，行军前的深入的思想动员是非常重要的。
    行军前的思想动员工作，大体说来，要从几个方面做深，做细。
    首先，要以毛泽东思想为武器，从根本上提高全体人员的阶级觉悟，提高干部战士行军锻炼的高度自觉性和政治热情。要做到这一点，就要联系国内外形势，把部队行军作战的目的和政治意义，向全体人员讲清楚，使每一个战士都懂得为什么行军，为什么打仗。战士们提高了阶级觉悟，明白了上级的意图，思想认识统一了，在任何艰难困苦的场合，都能够下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。一九六二年，蒋匪帮在美帝唆使下，妄图窜犯我国大陆。解放军部队在挺进东南沿海时，就是联系当时的国内外形势，向干部战士讲清了粉碎美蒋匪帮的罪恶阴谋，保卫祖国社会主义江山的伟大政治意义。同时普遍组织干部战士控诉了美帝和蒋匪帮的罪行，激发了他们的阶级觉悟和阶级仇恨心。部队始终情绪饱满，斗志昂扬，胜利完成了行军任务。
    为了教育部队发扬人民解放军吃大苦、耐大劳、英勇奋斗、艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，行军前连队都注意向部队进行革命英雄主义教育，激发部队的荣誉感。不少连队，在行军动员时，邀请老红军战士介绍红军在两万五千里长征中，爬雪山，过草地，吃树皮，咽草根，战胜重重困难的英雄事迹。请英雄模范人物，讲过去行军打仗的故事。解放军某部，在进行野营行军前，专门组织干部战士，学习红军飞夺泸定桥，强渡大渡河等革命战争回忆录，学习“硬骨头六连”和
  “喀喇昆仑山上硬八连”的事迹。这样，就大大增强了部队战胜千难万险，完成行军任务的必胜信心。战士们说：“革命老前辈，为了革命胜利，什么困难都不怕，我们走几百里路有什么可怕的！”
    要做好行军前的思想动员工作，还要特别注意抓好活思想，把思想工作做到每个人身上。不少连队在行军前都进行深入的调查研究，召开新老战士座谈会，摸清战士的思想底细，然后根据对各种不同人员的活思想，有针对性地进行思想教育。例如有些战士怕苦怕累，就组织他们学习毛主席关于战略上藐视困难，战术上重视困难等论述和《愚公移山》等文章。有的同志，往往在开始行军时，情绪很高，但是一遇到困难，脚上打了泡，或连续行军，过度疲劳时，情绪就低落下来，缺乏坚持到底的精神。这就要求把思想工作做在前面，使大家有充分的克服各种困难的思想准备，在任何困难面前，都具有“压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的英雄气概。
    在进行充分思想动员的同时，还要做好组织上和物质上的准备工作。准备工作做好了，行军任务才能圆满完成。
