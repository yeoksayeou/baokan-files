The delegation of the Albania-China Friendship Association left Wuhan for Shanghai today after a four-day visit to Wuhan. They departed by plane.

The Albanian comrades participated in the Wuhan city people's celebration of the 22nd anniversary of Albania's liberation. They visited the Wuhan Steel Company, Wuhan Tractor Factory, and the Yangtze River Bridge. They also held a discussion with the Red Guards. The Albanian comrades enthusiastically praised the Chinese workers, who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and have achieved great successes through self-reliance. A member of the delegation, the Secretary of the Tirana City Party Committee, Ramadan Iftiç, said, "The Chinese people have a high level of consciousness, and this consciousness comes from Mao Zedong Thought. Your achievements show that Mao Zedong Thought has become a great material force."

During their visit to Wuhan, the Albanian comrades were warmly welcomed everywhere. People waved the red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" The guests were also excited and raised their arms to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" When visiting the Wuhan Tractor Factory, the guests even sat on the brand-new small tractors that were being test-driven, learning to operate and drive them from the workers, and had unrestrained conversations with the workers.

When the delegation left Wuhan and arrived in Shanghai, provincial and municipal party and government leaders from Hubei, Wuhan, and Shanghai, as well as hundreds of revolutionary masses and Red Guards, went to the airport to see them off and welcome them.
