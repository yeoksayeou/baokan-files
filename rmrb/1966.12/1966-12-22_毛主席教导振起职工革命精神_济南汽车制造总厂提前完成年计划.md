The revolutionary workers of the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant have studied and applied Chairman Mao's teachings, combined revolution with production, and have completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule.

The Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's policy of self-reliance, has developed from a mere automobile parts factory into a full-fledged automobile manufacturing plant.

The Yellow River-brand heavy-duty trucks produced by the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant have a production task this year that is double that of last year. Faced with this arduous task, some people had feelings of difficulty. The workers, on one hand, seriously studied and applied the "Three Articles" by Chairman Mao, criticizing and transforming themselves to further establish the idea of producing automobiles for the revolution. On the other hand, they linked the development history of the factory with Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance and hard struggle, studying them over and over again. Chairman Mao's words educated the broad masses of workers to arouse their revolutionary spirit, unleash their wisdom and talents. They decided to carry out technological innovations and technological revolutions, improve labor efficiency, and overcome production difficulties. The entire factory has produced twenty-five specialized pieces of equipment through self-reliance, arming themselves. Since this year, the factory has implemented more than six hundred technological innovation projects. The factory has also designed and successfully tested ten new products.

    据新华社济南二十一日电　济南汽车制造总厂的广大革命职工，活学活用《毛主席语录》，抓革命，促生产，已经提前完成今年的生产计划。

    济南汽车制造总厂生产的黄河牌大型载重汽车，今年的生产任务比去年增加一倍。面对着这个艰巨的生产任务，有些人有畏难情绪。职工们一方面认真活学活用“老三篇”，破私立公，进一步树立为革命造汽车的思想；一方面联系本厂的发展史，一遍又一遍地学习毛主席有关自力更生、艰苦奋斗的语录。毛主席的话教育广大职工振起了革命精神，发挥了聪明才智，他们决定大搞技术革新、技术革命，提高劳动效率，克服生产中的困难。全厂自力更生制造设备，自己武装自己。今年以来，全厂已制成二十五台专用设备，有力地促进了生产。全厂已经实现的技术革新项目，共有六百多项。这个厂还设计、试制成功十种新产品。
