Alzaanian friends say Chairman Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to carry the socialist revolution through to the end

Mao Zedong Thought is the highest development of contemporary Marxism-Leninism

The Red Guards are the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution, are staunch anti-imperialist fighters, and are resolute supporters of the struggles of the oppressed peoples

Cairo, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- Devin Makoti and Nirode Sejak, representatives of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) in Cairo, said: "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist revolutionary of our time, and Mao Zedong Thought is the highest development of contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

The two Azanian nationalists spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter about their recent visit to China. They said that all the views they expressed were their shared opinions.

They praised the great international significance of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They said: "When we link this with what is happening in the Soviet Union today, we recognize the great significance of China's Cultural Revolution. Look, the Soviet leadership has been pursuing a policy of peaceful coexistence, peaceful competition, and peaceful transition in recent years. As the first socialist country in the world, it has not only failed to advance the socialist revolution but has also allowed capitalism to be restored. They deny the existence of class struggle, they have not carried out a cultural revolution, and these are some of the main factors leading to revisionism in the Soviet Union."

The two nationalists continued, "Chairman Mao launched the Cultural Revolution in China with the aim of carrying the socialist revolution through to the end. Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism to a new height, and this is one of his great achievements."

In refuting the slanders of imperialism and its followers against the Chinese Red Guards, they pointed out: "The Red Guards are carrying out a mission of international significance. They are not only the vanguard of China's Cultural Revolution but also staunch fighters against international imperialism and resolute supporters of the struggles of the oppressed peoples. We were greatly inspired by our talks with the Red Guards and members of the Red Guards Long March teams. We believe that they are reliable successors to the Chinese revolution."

The two Azanian nationalists were very pleased to receive copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They said: "We will also use Chairman Mao's words to analyze international issues. We will work hard in our struggle for liberation, just as Chairman Mao said about the spirit of the 'foolish old man who moved the mountains.' We are firmly convinced that final victory will belong to the oppressed peoples of Africa."

### 毛泽东思想是当代马列主义的最高发展

    阿扎尼亚朋友说毛主席发动文化大革命就是要把社会主义革命进行到底
    毛泽东思想是当代马列主义的最高发展
    红卫兵是文化大革命的先锋是坚强的反帝战士是被压迫人民斗争的坚决支持者
    新华社开罗电　阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会驻开罗代表德温·马科蒂和宁罗德·塞贾克说：“毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义革命家，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的最高发展。”
    这两位阿扎尼亚民族主义者在这里一起对新华社记者畅谈他们最近访问中国的印象。他们表示，两人各自发表的所有意见都是他们的共同看法。
    他们赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命具有重大的国际意义。他们说：“同苏联现在发生的情况联系起来，我们就认识到中国文化革命的重大意义。你看，苏联领导集团近年来执行的是一条和平共处、和平竞赛和和平过渡的政治路线。作为世界上第一个社会主义国家，它不但没有发展社会主义革命，反而使资本主义复辟。他们否认阶级矛盾的存在，他们没有进行文化革命，这都是苏联出现修正主义的一些主要因素。”
    两位民族主义者接着说，毛主席在中国发动文化大革命，其目的是要把社会主义革命进行到底。“毛主席把马克思列宁主义发展到了一个新的高度，这是他的伟大功绩之一。”
    他们在驳斥帝国主义及其追随者对中国红卫兵的污蔑时指出：“红卫兵正在执行一项具有国际意义的使命。他们不但是中国文化革命的先锋，而且是反对国际帝国主义的坚强战士，是被压迫人民斗争的坚决支持者。我们从自己同红卫兵和红卫兵长征队队员的谈话中受到了很大的鼓舞。我们相信，他们是中国革命的可靠接班人。”
    两位阿扎尼亚民族主义者对于能得到《毛主席语录》感到十分高兴。他们说：“我们也要用毛主席的话来分析国际问题。我们要像毛主席所说的愚公那样，在我们的解放斗争中努力工作。我们坚信，最后胜利一定属于我们被压迫的非洲人民。”
