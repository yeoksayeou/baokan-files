Statement by the Government of the People's Republic of China
December 15, 1966

The war claws of U.S. imperialism have once again reached the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi. On the afternoons of December 13th and 14th, the Johnson administration dispatched a large number of aircraft to carry out savage bombings of the city of Hanoi, causing heavy casualties and destruction. This is a serious provocation by U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people and all revolutionary people of the world. On the afternoon of the 14th, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement, strongly protesting against U.S. imperialism. The Chinese government and people firmly support the solemn statement of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and strongly condemn this heinous crime of U.S. imperialism.

Recently, U.S. imperialism, in collusion with modern revisionism, has attempted to use the Christmas ceasefire to orchestrate a "peace talk" conspiracy. The American bandits' continuous bombing of Hanoi is an important part of this conspiracy. As the bombing "gradually escalates," the collusion between the imperialists and revisionists becomes more frequent. They have gone to great lengths to carry out a series of shameful acts of coercing, enticing, and persuading peace. Rusk repeatedly shouts: "As long as the North expresses 'will stop doing something,' the U.S. can 'consider stopping the bombing.'" The Soviet representative at the United Nations loudly advocates: "The U.S. unconditionally and permanently stopping the bombing of the North is an indispensable step for achieving peace." The Pope, who has always served the U.S. imperialists' peace deception, also chimes in, saying: "The Christmas and New Year ceasefire should be 'connected together' to form a continuous period," so as to conduct peace talks. These accomplices of U.S. imperialism, under the U.S. war blackmail, sing in unison, echoing each other, and from all sides call out to the Vietnamese people. Their purpose is to make the Vietnamese people lay down their arms and accept the surrender conditions of U.S. imperialism.

However, the Vietnamese people are not to be trifled with. In his call to arms this July, Chairman Ho Chi Minh clearly stated: "The U.S. imperialists 'can use thousands of planes to intensify the bombing of North Vietnam. But they cannot shake the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist the Americans and save the country.' 'Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. When the day of victory comes, our people will rebuild our country more magnificently and more splendidly!' This is the solemn vow of the 31 million Vietnamese people to the people of the world, and a powerful response to the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy of 'bombing to force peace.'

Chairman Mao said: "The rampant activities of all internal and external dark forces have caused national disasters; but this rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have strength, but also shows their last struggles, showing that the people are gradually approaching victory." The U.S. imperialists' frenzied bombing of Hanoi means that the day of their final defeat in invading Vietnam is fast approaching. The current situation in Vietnam is good. The people of South Vietnam are fighting stronger and stronger, achieving brilliant victories; the military and people of North Vietnam have shot down more than 1,600 U.S. planes, giving a powerful lesson to the U.S. aggressors. From Lang Son to Cape Vung Tau, the 31 million Vietnamese people are united in their hatred of the enemy, fighting bravely to liberate the South, defend the North, and achieve national reunification. The struggle of the Vietnamese people has entered a critical period. Once this difficult path is crossed, final victory will be at hand.

China and Vietnam are close brotherly neighbors, interdependent and sharing weal and woe. The repeated savage bombings of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by U.S. imperialism cannot but arouse the extreme indignation of the Chinese people. U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Vietnam. The 700 million Chinese people will forever be the staunch backbone of the fraternal Vietnamese people. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have long been determined to fear no sacrifice and resolutely fight alongside the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism.

U.S. imperialism will surely be defeated!
The Vietnamese people will surely be victorious!

    中华人民共和国政府发表声明
    坚决支持越南政府的严正声明，强烈谴责美帝轰炸河内的滔天罪行，揭露美帝苏修一唱一和，此呼彼应，策动“以炸迫和”的大阴谋。
    强调指出，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，早就下定决心，不怕任何牺牲，坚决同越南人民一道，彻底打败美帝国主义。
    新华社十五日讯　中华人民共和国政府十五日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义接连派遣飞机轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市的滔天罪行。声明强调指出，七亿中国人民永远是兄弟的越南人民的坚强后盾。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，早就下定决心，不怕任何牺牲，坚决同越南人民一道，彻底打败美帝国主义。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府声明
                    一九六六年十二月十五日
    美帝国主义的战争魔爪，再一次伸向越南民主共和国的首都河内市。十二月十三日和十四日下午，约翰逊政府派遣大批飞机对河内市区进行了野蛮的轰炸，造成了重大的伤亡和破坏，这是美帝国主义对越南人民和全世界革命人民的一次严重挑衅。十四日下午，越南民主共和国政府发表声明，对美帝国主义提出强烈抗议。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持越南民主共和国政府的严正声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义这一滔天罪行。
    最近，美帝国主义伙同现代修正主义，企图利用圣诞节停火，策动一个“和谈”的大阴谋。美国强盗对河内的连续轰炸，就是推行这个阴谋的重要组成部分。随着轰炸的“逐步升级”，帝修的勾结也更加频繁。他们费尽心机干了一系列迫和、诱和、劝和的无耻勾当。腊斯克一再叫嚷：只要越南北方表示“将停止做什么事”，美国就“可以考虑停止轰炸”。苏联在联合国的代表则大肆鼓吹：美国“无条件地和永久地停止轰炸北方”是实现和平的一个不可缺少的步骤。一向为美帝国主义的和谈骗局效劳的罗马教皇，也出来帮腔说：应该把圣诞节和新年休战“连在一起，成为一个连续的时期”，以便进行和谈。这些美帝国主义的帮凶，在美国的战争讹诈下面，一唱一和，此呼彼应，从各方面向越南人民喊话，其目的就是要越南人民放下武器，接受美帝国主义的投降条件。
    但是，越南人民是不可侮的。胡志明主席在他今年七月的号召书中早就明确表示：美帝国主义“可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。”“河内、海防和其他一些城市、企业可能被摧毁，但是越南人民是不会被吓倒的！没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。在胜利的日子到来的时候，我国人民将重新把自己的祖国建设得更加堂皇，更加壮丽！”这就是三千一百万越南人民向全世界人民发出的庄严誓言，是对美帝国主义“以炸迫和”阴谋的有力回答。
    毛主席说：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”美帝国主义对河内的疯狂轰炸，就是说明它侵略越南最后失败的日子快要到了。目前越南的形势很好。越南南方人民越战越强，不断取得辉煌胜利；越南北方军民打落了一千六百多架美国飞机，有力地惩罚了美国侵略者。从谅山到金瓯角，三千一百万越南人民同仇敌忾，团结一致，为解放南方、保卫北方，实现祖国的统一而进行着英勇的战斗。越南人民的斗争已经进入了一个关键的时期，跨过这段艰难路程，最后的胜利就将到来。
    中越两国是亲密的兄弟邻邦，唇齿相依，安危与共。美帝国主义接二连三地对越南民主共和国首都的野蛮轰炸，不能不引起中国人民的无比愤怒。美帝国主义是中越两国人民的共同敌人。七亿中国人民永远是兄弟的越南人民的坚强后盾。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，早就下定决心，不怕任何牺牲，坚决同越南人民一道，彻底打败美帝国主义。
    美帝国主义必败！
    越南人民必胜！
