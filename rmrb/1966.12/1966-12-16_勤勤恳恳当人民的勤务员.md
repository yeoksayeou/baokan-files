Our Chairman Mao always teaches us to serve the Chinese people and all the people of the world wholeheartedly, to be honest and diligent servants of the people.

Why do we engage in revolution? It is to thoroughly overthrow the social system where people exploit and oppress each other, and to achieve communism throughout China and the world. Chairman Mao says, the proletariat not only needs to liberate itself but also needs to liberate all of humanity; if the proletariat does not liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself. Therefore, every revolutionary fighter, every Communist Party member, should have a great communist ambition, cherish the motherland, and have a global vision. In our minds, we should always think of the 700 million Chinese people and always think of the 3 billion people of the world.

The communist cause is a great, long-term, and arduous task. This requires every revolutionary fighter to truly master the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, to work completely and thoroughly for the people's interests, and to serve the people wholeheartedly. In the decades of brave struggle against powerful domestic and foreign enemies, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, countless ordinary yet great communist heroes have emerged. They seek neither fame nor wealth, fear neither hardship nor death. For the people's cause and the revolutionary cause, they dare to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire. They have paved the way for our victory with their silent labor and their heads and blood, writing a brilliant epic for the people. They will forever be our role models. In this surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, countless new communists will surely be cultivated and tempered. They will carry the torch of the revolutionary forerunners and advance swiftly towards the communist future.

Chairman Mao often quotes two lines from Lu Xun: "With a stern brow, defy the thousand accusing fingers; with a bowed head, be a willing ox for the children." He says, "All Communists, all revolutionaries, and all revolutionary literary and artistic workers should learn from Lu Xun's example, be the 'ox' of the proletariat and the masses, and dedicate themselves to the end." We are working for the early realization of communism in China and the world, consciously becoming the 'ox' of the proletariat and the masses. We work hard, bear hardships, and are honest and diligent servants of the people, adding bricks and tiles to the construction of communism. This is our greatest honor and the highest meaning of our lives. Some of us talk about struggling for communism, but lack the spirit of being an 'ox'. They are irresponsible in their work, picking the easy tasks and avoiding the hard ones; they lack enthusiasm for their comrades and are indifferent to them. They always put themselves first, with an "I" at the forefront. Especially when some people hold high positions, they think they are extraordinary and put on airs in front of the masses. They do not respect others but demand respect from others. They can criticize others, but others cannot criticize them. Such people are bound to hit the wall and fall.

Chairman Mao says: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people's service..." Chairman Mao's words are weighty and meaningful, serving as a motto for every revolutionary comrade. We must always remind ourselves and never forget.

During the Cultural Revolution, there is often such a situation: some leaders of units and departments, despite having faults and errors, do not reflect when criticized by the masses, but instead evade and dodge. They are very resentful of the masses' criticism, thinking, "Who are you to criticize me? This is unacceptable!" Due to this "official" mentality, they become antagonistic and opposed to the masses. When revolutionary masses criticize them, they panic and use various means to protect themselves, even retaliating against the revolutionary masses. These comrades should carefully review Chairman Mao's words: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism from others. Anyone can point out our mistakes. As long as you are right, we will correct them. If your method benefits the people, we will follow it." Look, how sincere and important Chairman Mao's words are! Some comrades do not follow this example. When praised, they listen happily; when criticized, they get angry and cannot be touched like a tiger's buttocks.

Why are they afraid of the masses' criticism? In the end, it is because they fear that criticism will make them lose face and lose their official hats. In short, it is their selfish thoughts that are at play. A person, if they are not wholeheartedly dedicated to the Party's cause and the people's cause, but only half-heartedly or with divided loyalties, even if their position is high, their seniority is long, and their abilities are great, they will inevitably make mistakes and fall.

Therefore, whether one is wholeheartedly serving the people and diligently serving as the people's servants is the fundamental mark of whether a revolutionary fighter has established a proletarian worldview.

The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a severe test for every Communist Party member and every revolutionary cadre. It tests whether each person is completely and thoroughly serving the people, diligently serving as the people's servants, and whether each person stands with the revolutionary people, with the proletariat, and with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, not only in words but also in actions.

Recently, Comrade Lin Biao called on us to study the "Three Articles" as our motto. This is an extremely important matter, a "basic construction" for the transformation of our worldview. We are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fighting against a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and criticizing the reactionary bourgeois line. The "Three Articles" are a powerful ideological weapon for us. Mastering this weapon allows us to identify and defeat the enemy; it also allows us to unite comrades, educate ourselves, promote ideological revolutionization, and transform our subjective world while transforming the objective world.

    勤勤恳恳当人民的勤务员
    任立新
    我们的毛主席总是教导我们，要全心全意地为中国人民和全世界人民服务，老老实实、勤勤恳恳地当人民的勤务员。
    我们为什么要干革命？就是要彻底推翻人剥削人、人压迫人的社会制度，在全中国、全世界实现共产主义。毛主席说，无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类；如果不解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。所以，我们每个革命战士，每个共产党员，都应当具有伟大的共产主义抱负，胸怀祖国，放眼世界。在我们脑子里，要时时刻刻想到七亿中国人民，时时刻刻想到三十亿世界人民。
    共产主义事业，是伟大的、长期的、艰巨的事业。这就要求我们每个革命战士，真正地掌握毛泽东思想这个所向无敌的武器，完全地、彻底地为人民利益而工作，全心全意地为人民服务。在几十年同国内外强大敌人的勇敢搏斗中，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，涌现了无数这种平凡而伟大的共产主义英雄。他们不为名，不为利，一不怕苦，二不怕死。为了人民的事业，革命的事业，他们刀山敢上，火海敢闯。他们用默默无闻的劳动，用自己的头颅和鲜血，为我们开辟了胜利前进的道路，为人民写下了光辉灿烂的史诗。他们永远是我们学习的榜样。在这场汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮中，一定会培养和锻炼出千千万万这种共产主义新人。他们将接过革命先驱者的火炬，向着共产主义的未来迅猛地前进。
    毛主席常常引用鲁迅的两句诗：“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”，并且说，“一切共产党员，一切革命家，一切革命的文艺工作者，都应该学鲁迅的榜样，做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”我们是为了共产主义在全中国和全世界的早日实现，自觉地做无产阶级和人民大众的“牛”。我们埋头苦干，任劳任怨，老老实实，勤勤恳恳地当人民的勤务员，就是为建设共产主义大厦添砖加瓦。这是我们无尚的光荣，是我们生活的最崇高的意义。我们有些人，口里也讲为共产主义奋斗，但是却缺乏这种做“牛”的精神。他们对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重；对同志缺乏热情，漠不关心。他们遇事把自己摆在第一位，“我”字当头。特别是有的人职务高了，更自以为了不起，向群众摆起臭架子来。他们不是以普通劳动者的姿态出现，而是把自己放在群众之上。他们可以不尊重别人，却要别人尊重自己。他们可以批评别人，别人却批评不得他们。这种人是没有不碰壁，不摔跤子的。
    毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，……”毛主席这几句话，语重心长，是我们每个革命同志的座右铭。我们要随时随地向自己敲警钟，千万不要忘记了。
    在文化大革命中，常常有这种情况：有些单位和部门的领导人，明明自己有缺点错误，群众提出了批评，就是不检讨，支支吾吾，躲躲闪闪。他们对群众的批评很反感，心想：“你们算得了什么，居然批评到我头上来了，这还了得！”由于这种“官老爷”思想的支配，他们就同群众抵触起来了，对立起来了。革命群众批评他们几下，他们又慌了手脚，用各种办法来保护自己，甚至对革命群众进行打击报复。这些同志应当很好地重温毛主席这一段话：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”请看，毛主席这几句话，讲得多么恳切，多么重要！有的同志就是不照这样办。别人表扬他，就听得进，而且很舒服；批评他，就听不进，而且动肝火，老虎屁股摸不得。
    他们为什么害怕群众批评呢？说来说去，他们是怕群众批评了，自己会失去尊严，会丢掉乌纱帽。一句话，还是自己的私心杂念在作怪。一个人，如果对党的事业，对人民的事业，不是全心全意，而是半心半意，不是一心一意，而是三心二意，即使他的职务再高，资格再老，本事再大，也非犯错误不可，非栽跟斗不可。所以，是不是全心全意为人民服务，勤勤恳恳做人民的勤务员，是每个革命战士是不是确立了无产阶级世界观的根本标志。
    当前的无产阶级文化大革命，对每一个共产党员，每一个革命干部，都是一个严峻的考验。它考验着每个人是不是完全、彻底地为人民服务，勤勤恳恳地当人民的勤务员，考验着每个人是不是不但在口头上而且在行动上也站在革命人民方面，站在无产阶级方面，站在毛主席的革命路线方面。
    最近，林彪同志号召我们要把“老三篇”当做座右铭来学。这是个非常非常重要的事情，是人们世界观改造的“基本建设”。我们进行无产阶级文化大革命，斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，批判资产阶级反动路线，“老三篇”是我们一个强大的战斗思想武器。掌握了这个武器，就可以用来识别敌人，战胜敌人；而且可以用来团结同志，教育自己，搞好思想革命化，在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界。
