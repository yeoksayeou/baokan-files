The Soviet revisionist leaders have once again dusted off the failed proposal to convene an "International Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties" from their dusty archives. Brezhnev, a faithful disciple of Khrushchev, stubbornly follows Khrushchev's old tricks, taking the stage at the congresses of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party to once again call for another "conference of communist parties." According to him, this conference will be a "new collective discussion among communists on the situation and tasks of the international communist movement."

Anyone who has observed the development of the international communist movement in recent years will easily see that Brezhnev's proposed new conference is merely a rehash of the failed initiative previously proposed by Khrushchev.

The Process of the "Conference" Proposed by the Khrushchevites

On July 30, 1964, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, headed by Khrushchev, proposed a specific plan and strict agenda for how and where the conference would be held. Khrushchev ordered that a "Drafting Committee" meeting be held in Moscow on December 15 of the same year, and a general conference with the participation of all parties be held in mid-1965.

Khrushchev proposed this plan in a desperate situation. His policy of betrayal, both domestically and internationally, had failed in all respects; the era of using Marxist phrases and covertly operating under the guise of the prestige of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had ended. The resolute struggle waged by the Communist Party of China, the Party of Labour of Albania, and other Marxist-Leninist parties and forces had completely exposed Khrushchev's mask. This struggle drew a clear line between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, between revolutionaries and traitors. Divisions and contradictions within the revisionist camp deepened, and the revisionist orchestra became increasingly unruly. Togliatti's will exposed the quarrels among the revisionists.

Khrushchev and his clique believed that their lifeline to escape their predicament was to convene a "Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties," and they wanted to control and manipulate this conference according to their plans and wishes. The conference had two main purposes: to "condemn" the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania and to strengthen the struggle against them; to strengthen the unity of the divided revisionist forces and prevent various revisionist groups from breaking away from the Soviet leadership. At the same time, the Soviet leaders also hoped to use this conference to organize a broad front to oppose the establishment of new Marxist-Leninist parties and revolutionary organizations. In short, the conference planned by Khrushchev, whether from the situation at the time of its proposed convening or from the purposes it sought to achieve, was aimed at strengthening the struggle against Marxism-Leninism; destroying unity and ultimately splitting the international communist movement; and consolidating the shaky position of Khrushchev revisionism.

However, all of Khrushchev's efforts to achieve these goals failed miserably. Despite using demagogic, flattering, threatening, deceiving, and blackmailing tactics, the conference failed. The exposure of the conspiracy behind the conference by Marxist-Leninist parties, especially the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, played a decisive role in this regard. The failure of the conference led to the downfall of its initiator, Khrushchev, who was discarded like a lemon peel by his accomplices. Why did Khrushchev's "international conference" plan fail?

Khrushchev desperately tried to stop the debate to smoothly push his base, treacherous, and revisionist line. The Marxist-Leninists, on the other hand, made the principled and revolutionary debate a powerful weapon, bravely and resolutely exposing the strategic and tactical plans of modern revisionism in all its aspects and forms.

Khrushchev tried to gather other countries' revisionists around a single center—the Soviet leadership—but he could not stop the centrifugal forces from developing. The multi-center theory of revisionism became more evident, and the scale of resistance to the "baton" increased.

Johnson's "bridging," his policy of approaching and infiltrating Eastern European countries, was quickly accepted by the revisionist groups in these countries, making their relations with the imperialists more direct and closer, no longer needing Khrushchev as an intermediary, thus further exposing and dividing the revisionists.

While tightening cooperation with American imperialism, the Soviet revisionists also tried to hide the meaning and purpose of the Soviet-American "holy alliance" from the peoples of various countries. However, they also suffered a crushing defeat in this activity. The line of cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union had already been exposed, aiming to dominate the world by the two superpowers, to divide spheres of influence between them, to suppress the revolutionary and national liberation movements of various countries, and to restore capitalism in socialist countries and strengthen bourgeois rule in other countries.

All these factors led to the failure of Khrushchev's "conference" plan. These factors, along with domestic failures, such as the collapse of the Khrushchevites' grandiose promises of abundant food and clothing, the failure of their boastful slogans of entering communism in a few years, and the incredible chaos caused by Khrushchev's reforms and super-reforms in the Soviet Union, led to the tragic fate of this traitor, the greatest traitor in the history of the international communist movement.

Khrushchev stepped down from the political stage, leaving his successors with a particularly difficult task: to carry out Khrushchevism without Khrushchev, to faithfully follow this already failed path, and to continue the doomed scheme. He especially left the task of preparing and convening the failed conference to his accomplices.

This is indeed a difficult task. Khrushchev's proposal to convene an international conference not only met with resolute resistance from various Marxist-Leninist parties but also faced opposition and hesitation from revisionists in other countries, especially after Khrushchev's downfall, when there were clear signs of dissatisfaction, anger, and independence from Moscow in these countries. In this situation, the new Soviet leadership had to postpone the conference, originally scheduled for December 15, 1964, to March 1, 1965, and change the name of the "Drafting Committee" to the "Consultative Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties."

However, postponing the conference and changing its name did not change its purpose in the slightest. In fact, the purpose of this conference was to achieve Khrushchev's plan in new circumstances. This was an arbitrary, divisive, and factional conference, a conference beneficial to imperialism. Thus, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and other new Soviet leaders tore off their masks, exposing their faces as faithful successors to Khrushchev's anti-Marxist, counter-revolutionary, and divisive line of conspiracy and betrayal to the world.

At this conference and in the documents adopted at the conference, the new strategy of the current Soviet leadership was formulated and adopted. Khrushchev's successors learned from Khrushchev's tragic experience, formulating a more flexible but, in their view, effective strategy to oppose Marxism-Leninism, revolution, and socialism. The essence of this strategy is deception: swearing allegiance to Marxism-Leninism and socialism while betraying Marxism-Leninism and socialism; swearing unity while destroying unity; on the one hand, calling for opposition to imperialism, and on the other hand, tightening cooperation with American imperialism; supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries in words, while sabotaging these revolutionary struggles in practice.

However, as a variant of lies, deception is not something that can be sustained forever. Such deception can only yield temporary gains, but those who practice it cannot avoid being exposed. Life itself, the struggle of Marxist-Leninist parties and forces, tore off all the masks of the Soviet leaders and publicly exposed them not only as faithful successors of Khrushchev but also as those who further developed, deepened, and concretized the treacherous line of their fallen mentor.

The Brezhnev-Kosygin group and their accomplices are traitors to communism and the most despicable and dangerous enemies

The new Soviet leaders have gone further than Khrushchev in pursuing the path of capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union and cooperation with American imperialism, in further executing the policy of division and great-power chauvinism towards socialist countries and communist parties. Khrushchev first approached American imperialism, while his successors have developed to the point of allying with and closely cooperating with American imperialism in various aspects. They have signed a series of agreements with the United States aimed at implementing the line of the two superpowers ruling the world. In addition, they continue on this path, approaching the Federal Republic of Germany and other Western imperialist countries, while colluding with Japanese imperialists in the Far East.

During Khrushchev's rule, he vigorously opposed China, while the current Soviet leadership, in collusion with American imperialists and other reactionaries, is using every means to build a "ring of fire" around China. The foreign policy of the Soviet Union under Brezhnev and Kosygin further exposes its intensified anti-China policy. All political initiatives and actions of the current Soviet government in international relations are closely linked to this policy, and there is no other explanation for them.

The collusion and cooperation of the Soviet leadership with the Indian reactionaries is an example. Together with imperialism, it provides large-scale economic and military aid to India to make India oppose China, incite it to wage war against China, and turn India into a permanent supply base for invading the southwestern border of the People's Republic of China. From the beginning, it was the instigation, support, and aid of Khrushchev and Kennedy that emboldened Nehru to launch an invasion of China. Now, it is still the instigation, aid, and support of the successors of Khrushchev and Kennedy that embolden Indira Gandhi and other Indian reactionaries to brandish their swords against China. These facts are plain for all to see.

On November 30 of this year, a new economic agreement was signed between the Soviet Union and India, according to which the Soviet leadership will provide the Indian reactionaries with a loan of 970 million rubles over five years (1966-1970), an amount double the aid provided in the previous five years and more than the total "economic aid" provided during the ten years of Khrushchev's rule. Similarly, according to the trade agreement signed on November 3, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and India will double in 1970 compared to 1965. The Soviet leadership is arming India with rockets, submarines, warships, tanks, aircraft, and other military equipment, and is helping to build some aircraft factories in India, one of which has already started production. All this "aid" is provided to India at a time when the Indian reactionary government is more frantically anti-China and facing major political and economic difficulties and is on the verge of total collapse. In fact, the purpose of this aid is to maintain the reactionary regime in India and to incite the Indian reactionaries to oppose China and its neighboring countries.

The increasingly extensive contacts and cooperation between the leaders of the Soviet Union and Japan have also expanded in scale, and they have established close friendship in various aspects. Japanese monopoly capital companies are invited to develop the natural resources of the Soviet Far East, Japanese aircraft are allowed to fly from one end of Siberia to the other, and important Soviet-Japanese contracts and agreements are about to be signed. All this is not accidental. This is the political line formulated and vigorously supported by American imperialism aimed at opposing and encircling the People's Republic of China.

The recent Soviet-Mongolian treaty is also signed in the same direction and for the same purpose, and the anti-China nature of this agreement is undeniable. Similarly, the successors of Khrushchev organized and directed the India-Pakistan talks held in Tashkent, are approaching the Thai government, are interested in the U.S. Southeast Asia Development Plan involving Chiang Kai-shek's remnants, are doing everything possible to support the Indonesian reactionaries to suppress communists and other revolutionary forces, and to incite the Indonesian reactionaries to oppose People's China. After conducting friendly and cordial talks with the butchers of the Indonesian people, on November 23, an agreement was signed in Moscow on the deferment of Indonesia's repayment of debts to the Soviet Union and an agreement on the expansion of trade between the two countries. The Indonesian military clique requests the Soviet government to provide spare parts for the Soviet tanks that have just arrived in Indonesia. The Soviet diplomatic representative in Indonesia openly praises the fascist regime in Indonesia and advocates strengthening the "well-founded" relations between the two countries.

All the activities of the Soviet Union, as well as other more covert or unpublicized activities, are part of the vicious conspiracy to form an alliance between revisionism and the United States and various reactionaries to encircle China militarily and prepare for an anti-China war.

As time goes on, it becomes increasingly clear that the American imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists are in collusion, using the Vietnamese issue to jointly plot an anti-China conspiracy. They fantasize that Vietnam (divided or reunified) will become a country serving imperialism-revisionism to encircle China, a country implementing an active anti-China policy, and a pillar in the anti-China war. The revisionists' attempt to bring the resolution of the Vietnamese issue into the track of Soviet-American cooperation is precisely for this purpose.

The tricks played by the Soviet Union and the United States on the Vietnamese issue are very complex, but their purpose is very clear, and the role they play is also very clear. In this trick, the Americans provide weapons and troops, while the revisionists act as saboteurs, fifth columnists, spreaders of terror, and defeatists. The common goal is to suppress Vietnam from within and without, encircle China, and escalate the aggression towards China.

The compromise reached between the Khrushchev revisionists and the imperialists of various countries in Europe clearly reveals the strategic goals of the Soviet-American preparation for an anti-China war. Under the slogan of "European security," with the approval and support of American imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leaders have embarked on the path of appeasement in Europe and aggression in Asia. This new "European" policy of the Soviet leaders, which has already taken formal shape at the recent Bucharest meeting of the Warsaw Pact countries, aims to ensure that American imperialism has no worries in Europe, to help American imperialism transfer its troops and equipment in Europe to Asia, to strengthen military operations in Vietnam and invade the People's Republic of China. The Soviet revisionists have reduced their burden in Europe, thus opening up new possibilities for concentrating their forces on the Asian battlefield. Currently, the spearhead of the Soviet-American joint struggle for world domination is directed at the Asian battlefield.

The Soviet propaganda on appeasement in Europe, or the recent visits and planned meetings by Brezhnev and Kosygin, coincide with Johnson's visit to Asia and the Manila meeting, which is not accidental. These developments occurred after a series of direct talks between high-level representatives of the Soviet Union and the United States, while American military forces were being transferred in large numbers from Europe to Vietnam and American military bases in Asia. It is after these major diplomatic conspiracies that the Khrushchev revisionists launched a new anti-China propaganda campaign and claimed to convene a "conference of communist parties." The close coordination and intensified implementation of the anti-China struggle by the imperialists-revisionists are evident, and any deception or trickery cannot cover it up.

American imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists are in deep contradictions, which reflect their weakness

On the surface, the international situation seems to show that American imperialists and Soviet leaders are influential, taking the initiative, and eager to utilize the situation and opportunities. However, in this complex situation, the weakness of the imperialists-revisionists is more evident than ever.

As time goes on, contradictions among imperialist countries are intensifying and deepening. In their preparation for war, conclusion of new alliances, competition for markets and spheres of influence, competition and struggle are constantly intensifying. The United States has lost the hegemony it established in the short period after World War II over capitalist countries and can no longer and has no practical possibility of reorganizing the forces of capitalism and putting other imperialist countries under its control. These countries, which were the main partners of the United States in aggressive treaties, are now trying to completely break free from the past American economic, political, and military control. Now, these countries are firmly demanding their own position in world politics and their own share in the capitalist world market.

The disagreements among imperialist countries, due to endless quarrels over adopting common policies and attitudes towards third countries, have caused a significant impact on aggressive treaties such as NATO, exposing the contradictions.

Currently, American hegemony in Europe is not only opposed by French bourgeoisie. France feels it has sufficient strength to resist American orders and defend its own interests. West Germany is also beginning to waver, causing many troubles for its transatlantic friends. These two countries, of course, based on their own interests, demand the renegotiation of old alliances and the search for new markets to counter American pressure. In Japanese militarism and British imperialism, there are also similar phenomena to a greater or lesser extent.

The policy of American interference and aggression towards other countries makes its allies, who do not want to get involved in American adventures, extremely uneasy. This policy has not received any effective support from them. For example, American imperialists are doing everything possible to internationalize their aggression against Vietnam, but in fact, they are far from achieving what they did during the Korean War, when they could rally a large number of allies under the banner of the United Nations.

The famous American journalist Lipmann recently, when talking about the current isolation of the United States and the lack of support from its European allies for the Vietnam War, wrote: "Any government of a European country that joins us on the battlefield cannot survive. The illusion that the Wilson government will send a small number of troops to Vietnam has been shattered. As for our claim to save the peoples of Asia, not a single independent country in Asia—Japan, India, Pakistan, Burma, Malaya, and Indonesia—has given us any support, not even symbolic support. Only the dependent countries of Australia and New Zealand are with us. They are the outposts abandoned by the former British Empire."

The revisionist camp itself is also afflicted with the disease of the capitalist world. The Soviet leaders have used various means and methods to fill the ever-widening gaps. To achieve this goal, they use rubles and pressure, threats, and chauvinist blackmail. However, the results are tragic.

The chauvinist policy pursued by the Soviet leadership has aroused narrow nationalism, dissatisfaction, various forms of resistance, and opposition among its followers. Each revisionist group, in order to defend its own interests, always disregards the harm to others and tries to establish its own alliances. In addition, in order to act freely and as a means of blackmailing the Soviet Union, many groups replace rubles with dollars and establish various relations with the West. In these confrontational actions and this struggle, there is no principle at all. This is the law of the bourgeois society they restored in their own countries at work, which arouses nationalist sentiments, causes endless quarrels, and endless competition.

The merciless exposure of the Khrushchev revisionists by Marxist-Leninists has further deepened and worsened this crisis. At the same time, this exposure helps to strengthen the revolutionary spirit of communists and working people. In the Soviet Union, the anti-revisionist movement is growing, manifesting itself in the establishment of secret revolutionary committees, and in other countries, such as Poland, Marxist-Leninist revolutionary parties have been established. In these countries where revisionist groups are in power, these various factors of different natures are all fires directed at the revisionist groups, fundamentally determining their inevitable destruction.

The struggle of Marxist-Leninist parties and forces against Khrushchev revisionism, the establishment of new revolutionary parties and organizations in various countries, the weakening of relations between revisionist countries and parties, and the significant reduction of the influence of Soviet revisionists on them are all continuing to develop. The Soviet leaders and other revisionist groups are at a loss, desperately trying to get rid of the crises that are tormenting them from within and without. Facing such failure and great exposure in the international communist movement, facing the rebellion of their own people against their anti-Marxist and capitulationist policies, facing the serious economic difficulties caused by the implementation of capitalist reforms, they are holding one secret or public meeting after another to find some remedy to get out of the giant pincers that have them in their grip.

The Purpose of the Brezhnev Revisionist Group to Convene a "Conference of Communist Parties"

In the difficult situation of the Khrushchev revisionists, Brezhnev and his open agents call for the convening of a "conference of communist parties." The situation that forces them to take this step is obvious, just as people understand the purposes and goals they intend to achieve.

First, the revisionist leaders want to cover up their treacherous, anti-Marxist, and capitulationist policies, to cover up their rapprochement and cooperation with American imperialism, and to cover up the policy of capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union. The Khrushchevites need this "massive communist conference" to present it as a "great achievement" on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, while they have fundamentally betrayed and destroyed the ideals and great cause of the October Socialist Revolution.

Second, they hope to strengthen their already shaky leadership in the revisionist camp and to strengthen the disintegrating revisionist forces through this conference, even if they cannot truly strengthen them, at least to create a surface phenomenon of unity with the conference attendees.

Third, they mainly intend to strike at the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania through this conference, to condemn them as "dogmatists," "splitters," "sectarians," and so on. Although Brezhnev guarantees not to exclude or condemn anyone, it is undoubted that the main purpose of the conference will be to attack the Marxist-Leninist parties and their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist revolutionary lines. The recent World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting in Sofia saw such a shameful act, where the Chinese representative was excluded from the conference at the instigation of the Soviet revisionists, while the traitor Titoites were allowed to participate, clearly exposing the plans and conspiracies of the Khrushchevites. Therefore, this is the prelude to the tricks that Brezhnev and his ilk want to play at the "Conference of Communist Parties."

Fourth, the Soviet revisionist leaders intend to formalize their anti-China, anti-revolutionary policy of allying and closely cooperating with American imperialism and the world reactionaries as an official line here, and to more enthusiastically continue to implement this policy.

The Soviet leaders believe they have invented a deceptive and deceitful argument for convening this conference, which can be discussed anew at the conference and serve as the overall basis for the conference. This is the well-known slogan now known to everyone: "Unity and support for Vietnam." This slogan means that unified action must be taken in the "struggle against American imperialism." The Khrushchev revisionist leaders make the issue of "supporting Vietnam" the basis for the "conference of communist parties," which, of course, they do not intend to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression, nor do they intend to fight against American imperialism themselves. If they were anti-imperialist communists and revolutionaries, they could support Vietnam and fight against this imperialism that is not just stuck in Vietnam without holding such a conference.

Not only that, the Soviet revisionist leaders and their allies, instead of fighting against imperialism, are increasingly colluding with the American imperialist butchers who are slaughtering the Vietnamese people. How hypocritical this is. Just as Brezhnev and his followers are shouting "unified action" and "opposition to American imperialism" and "supporting" Vietnam at the congresses of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, these two socialist countries elevate their diplomatic relations with the United States to the ambassadorial level. This fact itself does not clearly prove that the revisionists are truly united and taking unified action with the American imperialist butchers who are slaughtering the Vietnamese people? Kadar, the First Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, even said on the congress platform: "We are striving for the normalization of relations with the United States, and we hope to establish relations with the United States in the fields of politics, economics, and science. If they express such a desire on their side, then our relations can be improved." He also said: "Hungary has accepted the American request: on the day of the opening of the congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the news that we have upgraded our diplomatic mission to the ambassadorial level was announced." And he called all these actions a "principled policy, not a tactical one." In fact, only those who have abandoned all principles can carry out such a "principled" policy.

Obviously, the proposal to unite and support Vietnam is a revisionist trick, a despicable speculation on the genuine feelings of the peoples of various countries to support Vietnam, a conspiracy to speculate on an issue that concerns all honest people in the world, and a conspiracy to exploit the hatred of people all over the world for the aggressors of Vietnam.

The "Vietnam issue" is of great strategic significance to the Soviet leaders because, in the current situation, the Khrushchevites can only use this issue to try to rally various revisionist groups around them and only on this issue can they put on a show of some unity, carry out deceptive propaganda, and deceive public opinion.

In addition, the Soviet leaders base the "conference of communist parties" on the Vietnam issue, hoping that in this way they can "expose" the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, which oppose and refuse to participate in this revisionist conference, as if they are opposed to unity and support for the Vietnamese people and unity in the struggle against American imperialism.

However, the Khrushchev revisionists' deception propaganda, attempting to make people believe that they are against American imperialism, is in vain. Their adoption of a "joint resolution" on "aiding" Vietnam is also in vain. They cannot distort facts and erase the truth. The Albanian people and the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, together with all the revolutionary peoples of the world, have been and are completely united, have been and are unconditionally supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the country. They resolutely condemn the armed aggression and "peace talks" fraud of American imperialism. They also fearlessly expose the deceptive tricks of the new Soviet leaders. The new Soviet leaders, while pretending to support the Vietnamese people, betray the Vietnamese people, collude with American imperialism, and plot conspiracies to force the Vietnamese people to surrender.

The Khrushchev revisionists' despicable deception propaganda on "unity of socialist countries against imperialism" and "joint action on the Vietnam issue" is actually a conspiracy to cover up their great betrayal of the Vietnamese people. The successors of Khrushchev put on some postures of supporting Vietnam or opposing American imperialism, trying to bring the Vietnam issue into the scope of Soviet-American cooperation, into the line of the two superpowers ruling the world.

The Khrushchev revisionists are not concerned with helping the Vietnamese people but with how to betray the Vietnamese people, not with how to resist the Americans but with how to support the Americans. The main concern of the Soviet leaders is how to support the Americans in expanding their aggression against Vietnam and impose Johnson's "peace talks" deception on the Vietnamese people. This is the main aspect because the military and political failures of the United States, as well as the victories of the people's war in Vietnam, are also the great failures of the Khrushchev revisionists, the great failures of their short-term and long-term strategies. The interests and goals of such a force are diametrically opposed to the interests of the Vietnamese people, the peoples of the world, the revolution, and the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of various countries. How can one "joint action" with such a force?

The Soviet leaders loudly proclaim and swear to heaven that on the Vietnam issue, they completely support the position of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and they have not taken a special attitude. If this were true, then why do the leaders of American imperialism and their allies and agents discuss and study the Vietnam issue day after day with the Soviet revisionist leaders? Why do Johnson, Rusk, Harriman, Wilson, Brown, Paul Martin, Tito, Indira Gandhi, and Shigenobu, not to mention the many other representatives of imperialism and reactionaries and their faithful agents, seek help from the Soviet leaders on the Vietnam issue? Do they think they are so naive that they knock on the tightly closed door in vain? Of course not. No one will believe such a naive thing. Therefore, one thing is clear: in these secret meetings and talks, new conspiracies have been plotted, the original conspiracies have been further implemented, tricks and plots have been devised, and joint actions against Vietnam and China have been coordinated.

The Vietnam issue cannot, as the revisionists claim, serve as a basis for unity, but rather, it is one of the fundamental issues that separate the revisionists from the Marxist-Leninists, making their struggle irreconcilable, and making it necessary for all revolutionaries and all those who truly stand on the side of the Vietnamese people to resolutely fight to thoroughly expose the true face of the Khrushchev revisionists as the allies and accomplices of imperialism.

The Soviet revisionists need to convene a "conference of communist parties" now for another reason. They are greatly fearful of the recent revolutionary events in China, understanding that their hope of changes in China favorable to revisionism and the restoration of capitalism has been dashed. Due to the thorough revolutionary measures taken by the Communist Party of China in recent times, the great People's China has become even stronger, the Chinese revolution is advancing smoothly along the correct path of Marxism-Leninism, and its influence in the world is growing.

China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution against bourgeois and revisionist ideas in people's minds, aiming at all class enemies, both open and covert revisionists; these people attempt to make China regress to the capitalist road; this revolution aims at American imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism, and it has fundamentally shaken the revisionist groups everywhere. Under the banner of this great revolution, the Communist Party members, workers, peasants, and revolutionary Red Guards of China, guided by the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, are uprooting all weeds, exposing degenerate elements, exposing all those with revisionist views—friends and allies of the Khrushchevites—and have shattered their last hopes. However, the recent events in China are not just a blow to the revisionists.

China's Cultural Revolution, the great revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, which is flourishing, is an inspiring example for all true revolutionaries in the world. For the true communists and revolutionary youth in the Soviet Union and other countries where the revisionists have usurped power, this example is particularly inspiring and motivating. It points out the path of struggle against revisionism, which is the path of revolutionary mass action, the path of mobilizing the masses to expose the betrayal of revisionism and sweep away all revisionist elements. What the revisionists fear is precisely this: the example of China may one day have an impact on their countries. Therefore, to resist the danger posed by this great revolutionary example to them, and to distort the truth and the noble purpose of this great revolution, the revisionists, together with imperialism, viciously slander China's Cultural Revolution. Their newspapers are now filled with statements and articles attacking the Communist Party of China, attacking Comrade Mao Zedong, attacking the correct line of Marxism-Leninism of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, and the great achievements of the Chinese revolution and the Chinese people.

The revisionists now plan to make a so-called "ideological historical document" on China's Cultural Revolution and the decisions of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The content of this decision is not difficult to predict. Its outline has already been proposed in an article titled "On the Situation in China" published in Pravda on November 27, which is full of slander, lies, and vicious curses against the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese leadership.

Thus, the Soviet revisionist leaders have exposed themselves again as clowns like Khrushchev, appearing on stage to debate, attacking socialism and revolution with the slander of a cheat and the curses of a ruffian. Now, the situation of 1964 is being faithfully reproduced, when Khrushchev did not attack the People's Republic of China for a single day, when he raged and used both soft and hard tactics at the congresses of some revisionist parties to demand the holding of the infamous conference to condemn the Communist Party of China and expel it from the world communist movement.

The article in Pravda, Brezhnev's call from the podiums of the congresses of the Bulgarian and Hungarian parties for a new conference of revisionist parties, at which the Communist Party of China, the Party of Labour of Albania, and other parties loyal to Marxism-Leninism will be "condemned" and "expelled," the entire new anti-China propaganda carried out by Soviet revisionist newspapers and some newspapers of certain countries following them, these facts themselves refute the deceptive tricks and conspiracies of the Soviet leaders after the fall of Khrushchev.

However, as Khrushchev proved at the time, these things do not indicate their strength but indicate their weakness, the failure of their unprincipled struggle, and the failure of their deceptive tricks. The desperate attempt of the Soviet revisionists to defeat the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China shows that the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China are an insurmountable obstacle to the realization of the anti-Marxist and anti-socialist conspiracies of the revisionists. They attack the Communist Party of China, attack the Party of Labour of Albania, attempt to separate the peoples, revolutionaries, and our Marxist-Leninists, attempt to isolate and subdue us. However, they actually expose and isolate themselves, and they are increasingly deepening the chasm that separates them from the communist movement and the revolutionary peoples of the world.

The only path for the Marxist-Leninist unity of true revolutionaries is to resolutely fight to expose Khrushchev revisionism

It seems that all revisionists now agree to convene a "conference of communist parties" according to the program proposed by the Soviet leadership, although due to differences in interests and strategic considerations, they have serious disagreements with the Soviet revisionists and among themselves. The Khrushchev revisionists, due to their exposure and failures in domestic and foreign policies, are experiencing a very serious crisis, and the pressure among them is very intense, so for them, convening an international conference is necessary and inevitable. The Soviet leaders, who are eager to re-establish their hegemony over various revisionist groups, to attack China, and to justify their rapprochement and cooperation with American imperialism, are doing everything possible not to miss this opportunity. The "arguments" of this conference are so "timely" that each revisionist group can "justify" its participation in the conference and maintain its "independence" and "views" on the surface.

Some revisionist groups have already begun to express doubts about the timing and agenda of the conference. Some express doubts and hesitation, saying that the conditions for convening the conference are "not ripe" or that more time is needed for preparation. Others say that convening the conference is fine! Expelling from the party is not fine. Still, others openly support the Soviet plan and say that the conditions are "ripe" or "are ripening," and there is no reason to wait any longer. Some remain silent and say nothing. As for the Soviet revisionists who have long decided to go ahead, they can hold the conference even if they only do so with those who are willing to participate. As for those who do not attend this "grand event," the Soviet leaders know very well that these people agree with the purpose of the conference, and these people, to maintain their so-called independent position, do not want to openly unite with others. The Soviet leaders are very pleased with and can accept this middle position of these people, believing that this position is a disruption of the principled struggle of Marxist-Leninists to expose the Khrushchev revisionists. These people do not participate in this conference, which is the least harmful to them.

The Soviet revisionists themselves, from historical experience, know what serves their interests and is in their interests. They know that the middle position in the communist movement is a temporary stop, a transition to the position of opportunism and betrayal of Marxism-Leninism.

The new "conference of communist parties" planned by the Soviet revisionist leaders after the March 1965 conference is a new diversionary action to further split the international communist movement, to disrupt the anti-imperialist united front of the peoples of various countries, and to disrupt the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They intend to use this conference to further promote the anti-China movement, to impose their revisionist ideas and lines on the communist movement, to cover up their rapprochement and cooperation with American imperialism, and to divert attention from their failures and exposures.

However, the new tricks that the Soviet revisionist leadership intends to play at the "conference of communist parties" are doomed to fail. Whether or not there is this conference, the failure of the Khrushchev revisionists and their inevitable final failure are unavoidable. The new leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the state will meet the same dishonorable fate as its predecessor. No tricks, no conspiracies, no deceptive tricks can change its bleak future.

The challenge posed by the Khrushchev revisionists to the Marxist-Leninists through their conference does not frighten anyone. On the contrary, it will prompt all true communists, all true revolutionaries, to correctly analyze the situation and draw the necessary conclusions, to further strengthen the resolute struggle against Khrushchev revisionism, and to fearlessly expose all their deceptive conspiracies.

Now is the time to draw a clear line with all kinds of modern revisionists. The hope that the traitorous revisionists will one day return to the right path has disappeared. Now, everything separates the Marxist-Leninists from the Khrushchev revisionists, and nothing unites them. They are on diametrically opposite poles in both political thought and ultimate goals. Due to the pursuit of anti-Marxist and treacherous policies of betrayal, the Khrushchev revisionists have placed themselves outside the ranks of the international communist movement and outside the anti-imperialist front.

Our party has publicly declared that the sharp reality on the agenda today is not to reconcile and unite with the revisionists but to completely break with them. Communists and revolutionaries need true unity, but such unity cannot be achieved through the kind of conference currently planned by the Soviet revisionists. This unity will be established in the struggle against Khrushchev, Tito, and all kinds of modern revisionists and on the basis of tested Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

Our party has expressed its principled position on the historical tasks facing the communist movement in the current situation, especially on the struggle against revisionism, in many materials and documents, particularly in Comrade Enver Hoxha's report on the work of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania at the Fifth Congress of the Party.

Comrade Enver Hoxha said in his report: "The situation in the world and the international communist movement is developing in a direction favorable to us and unfavorable to the enemy. However, we must face this situation and bravely deal with it, because imperialism and revisionism, these enemies, despite their failures, have not laid down their arms. On the contrary, they are intensifying their collusion and activities. For this situation, there is no room for weakness, hesitation, and indecision, but it requires courage, decisiveness, and maturity, not to adopt a strategy of leniency, weakness, and opportunism, and empty talk, but to adopt swift and combative actions, to adopt a combative strategy that is beneficial to our revolutionary strategy every day and every hour, that is, to determine a wise and prudent strategy based on the combat situation and circumstances of each party. Undoubtedly, with a revolutionary strategy and tactics based on our invincible ideology, the Marxist-Leninist parties and forces will advance courageously and, together with the working class, the oppressed peoples, and oppressed nations, achieve new victories in the sacred struggle against imperialism and revisionism, for the victory of Marxism-Leninism, socialism, revolution, and world peace."

    勃列日涅夫建议召开的“各国共产党”会议是赫鲁晓夫
    修正主义者反对马克思列宁主义和反革命的新阴谋
    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十二月十三日发表的编辑部文章
    新华社地拉那二十六日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十二月十三日发表了题为《勃列日涅夫建议召开的“各国共产党”会议是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者反对马克思列宁主义和反革命的新阴谋》的编辑部文章。全文如下：
      苏联修正主义领导人又一次从积满灰尘的档案中搬出关于召开“共产党和工人党”国际会议的已经破产的主张。赫鲁晓夫的忠实门徒勃列日涅夫执迷不悟地仿效赫鲁晓夫的老一套作法，登上保加利亚共产党和匈牙利社会主义工人党代表大会的讲台，又一次发出举行另一次“各国共产党”会议的呼吁。按照他的说法，这次会议将是“共产党人对国际共产主义运动的形势及其任务的一次新的集体讨论”。
    凡是注视国际共产主义运动近几年来发展情况的人都不难看出，勃列日涅夫建议召开的新的会议，只不过是从前赫鲁晓夫提出的破产的倡议的翻版。
     赫鲁晓夫分子建议召开的“会议”的经过
    一九六四年七月三十日，赫鲁晓夫主持的苏联共产党中央委员会提出了会议如何举行和在什么地方举行的具体计划和严格的议程。赫鲁晓夫下令，同年十二月十五日应在莫斯科举行“起草委员会”会议，一九六五年年中举行各国党都参加的大会。
    赫鲁晓夫在绝望的处境中才提出了举行这种会议的计划。当时，对内对外的背叛政策在各个方面已遭到失败；苏联领导人口头上挂着马克思主义的词句和利用苏联及苏联共产党享有的巨大威望来平安无事地暗中进行活动的时代已经结束了。中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党以及其它马克思列宁主义政党和力量进行的坚决斗争，完全撕下了赫鲁晓夫的假面具。这场斗争划清了马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间、革命者和叛徒之间的界线。在修正主义者阵线内部，分裂和矛盾开始加深，修正主义乐队越来越不服从指挥棒。陶里亚蒂的遗嘱把修正主义者的争吵暴露无遗。
    赫鲁晓夫及其一伙认为，他们摆脱困境的救生圈就是举行一次“共产党和工人党会议”，他们想按照他们的计划和愿望控制和操纵这个会议。会议要达到两个主要的目的：“谴责”中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党并且加强反对它们的斗争；加强修正主义者的分裂的队伍的团结和防止各修正主义集团摆脱苏联领导集团。苏联领导人同时还希望通过这次会议组织起一个广泛的阵线来反对成立新的马克思列宁主义政党和革命组织。一句话，赫鲁晓夫策划的这个会议，不论从当时要举行会议的情况来看或是从会议企图达到的目的来看，都是为了加强反对马克思列宁主义的斗争；破坏团结和最后分裂国际共产主义运动；巩固赫鲁晓夫修正主义的摇摇欲坠的阵地。
    但是，赫鲁晓夫为达到他的这些目的而作出的一切努力都遭到了彻底的失败。尽管他采取了蛊惑人心、吹捧、威胁、欺骗和讹诈等手段，会议还是失败了。马克思列宁主义政党，首先是中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党对这次会议的阴谋的揭露，在这方面起了决定性的作用。会议的失败导致了会议的倡议者赫鲁晓夫的垮台，赫鲁晓夫像一块柠檬皮似的被他的同谋者抛弃了。赫鲁晓夫的“国际会议”计划为什么遭到失败呢？
    赫鲁晓夫曾徒劳地拚命设法停止论战，以便平安无事地推行他的卑鄙的、投降的修正主义路线。而马克思列宁主义者则越来越使原则性的和革命的论战成为强大的武器，他们勇敢坚决地揭露了现代修正主义在各个方面的和各种形式的战略和策略计划。
    赫鲁晓夫竭力把其它国家的修正主义者纠集在唯一的一个中心——苏联领导集团——的周围，但是他没有能够阻止离心力量的发展。修正主义的多中心论更加明显，对“指挥棒”反抗的规模更大了。
    约翰逊的“搭桥”，他向东欧国家接近和渗透的政策很快为这些国家的修正主义集团所接受，这就使得它们同帝国主义者的关系更加密切和直接了，不再需要赫鲁晓夫来作中间人，从而使修正主义者进一步暴露和分裂。
    苏联修正主义者一面加紧同美帝国主义靠拢和合作，同时竭力向各国人民掩盖苏美“神圣同盟”的意义和目的。但是，他们在这一活动中也遭到了惨败。美国和苏联之间的合作路线已经被公开揭露，它是一条旨在由两大国主宰世界的路线，是在它们之间划分势力范围的路线，是镇压各国人民的革命和民族解放运动的路线，是在社会主义国家搞资本主义复辟和在其它国家加强资产阶级统治的路线。
    以上种种导致了赫鲁晓夫的“会议”计划的失败。这些因素以及在国内遭到的失败，例如赫鲁晓夫分子关于实现丰衣足食的大肆渲染的诺言的破产，关于在几年之内就可以进入共产主义的吹牛皮的口号的破产，由于赫鲁晓夫的改革和超级改革而在苏联造成的难以置信的混乱，这一切导致了这个叛徒、国际共产主义运动史上空前未有的叛徒的悲惨下场。
    赫鲁晓夫退出了政治舞台，给他的继承者留下了一项特别艰难的任务：推行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫主义，忠实地走这条已经遭到失败的道路，把注定要完蛋的勾当继续搞下去。他特别把筹备和召开没有开成的会议的任务留给他的同伙。
    这真是一件难事。赫鲁晓夫的关于召开国际会议的主张不仅遭到各个马克思列宁主义党的坚决抵制，而且其它国家的修正主义者也采取反对和犹豫的态度，特别是在赫鲁晓夫下台之后，在这些国家公开出现了对莫斯科不满、气愤和闹独立的明显迹象。在这种情况下，苏联新领导人不得不把原定在一九六四年十二月十五日举行的会议推迟到一九六五年三月一日，并把“起草委员会”这一名称改为“共产党和工人党代表协商会议”。
    但是推迟会议和换上新名称都丝毫没有改变这个会议的目的。事实上，这个会议的目的就是要在新的情况下实现赫鲁晓夫的计划。这是一个独断专行的、搞分裂和派系活动的会议，是一个有利于帝国主义的会议。这样，勃列日涅夫、柯西金等苏联新领导人就撕下了假面具，向全世界暴露了他们作为赫鲁晓夫的反马克思主义、反革命、分裂主义和策划阴谋的背叛路线的忠实继承者的嘴脸。
    在这次会议上、在会议通过的文件中，制订和通过了苏联现领导人的新策略。赫鲁晓夫的继承者从赫鲁晓夫的悲惨的经验中吸取了教训，制订了更加有伸缩性的、但在他们看来能有效地反对马克思列宁主义、反对革命和社会主义的策略。这种策略的实质就是蛊惑人心：发誓忠实于马克思列宁主义和社会主义，同时背叛马克思列宁主义和社会主义；对天发誓主张团结，同时破坏团结；一方面呼吁反对帝国主义，另一方面加紧同美帝国主义合作；在口头上支持各国人民的革命斗争，而在事实上破坏这些革命斗争。
      然而，作为谎言的变种的蛊惑人心的伎俩，是不能永远搞下去的。这种蛊惑人心的伎俩只能得到一时的好处，但是搞这一手的人避免不了要遭到揭露。生活本身、马克思列宁主义政党和力量的斗争撕下了苏联领导人的一切假面具，并公开揭露了他们不仅是赫鲁晓夫的忠实的继承者，而且他们进一步发展、深化和具体化了他们的下了台的祖师爷所倡议的背信弃义的路线。
    勃列日涅夫—柯西金及其同伙的集团是共产主义的叛徒和最卑鄙危险的敌人
    苏联新领导人在苏联搞资本主义复辟和同美帝国主义合作的道路上，在对社会主义国家和共产党进一步执行分裂和大国沙文主义政策的道路上，比赫鲁晓夫走得更远。赫鲁晓夫首先同美帝国主义靠拢，而他的继承者已经发展到同美帝国主义结盟和多方面进行密切合作的地步。他们同美国签订了一系列旨在推行两大国统治世界的路线的协定。此外，他们在这条道路上继续走下去，已经同德意志联邦共和国和西方其它帝国主义国家接近，而在远东则同日本帝国主义者勾结在一起。
    赫鲁晓夫在当权时曾竭力反对中国，而苏联现领导集团则同美帝国主义者、其它反动派勾结起来，用一切办法在中国的周围建立“火力包围圈”。勃列日涅夫和柯西金统治下的苏联的对外政策进一步暴露了其加紧反华的方针。苏联现政府在国际关系方面的一切政治倡议和行动都是同这种政策紧密联系的，除了对它们作这种解释外，不可能有任何别的解释。
    苏联领导集团同印度反动派的勾结和合作就是一个例子。它同帝国主义一起向印度提供大量的经济和军事援助，以便使印度反对中国，挑唆它同中国作战，把印度变成侵略中华人民共和国的西南边境的经常性的兵站。从一开始，正是赫鲁晓夫和肯尼迪的挑唆、支持和援助，才使得尼赫鲁敢于向中国发动侵略。现在仍然是赫鲁晓夫和肯尼迪的继承者的同样的挑唆、同样的援助和同样的支持，才使得英迪拉·甘地和印度其他反动分子向中国挥动干戈。这些事实都是有目共睹的。
    今年十一月三十日，苏联和印度之间签订了一项新的经济协定，根据这项协定，苏联领导集团将在五年（一九六六——一九七○年）内向印度反动派提供九亿七千万卢布的贷款，这个数目比前五年向印度提供的援助多一倍，比赫鲁晓夫当政的十年期间提供的全部“经济援助”还多。同样，根据十一月三日签订的贸易协定，苏联和印度的贸易额一九七○年将比一九六五年增加一倍。苏联领导集团正在用火箭、潜艇、军舰、坦克、飞机和其它军事装备武装印度，它正在印度帮助建设一些制造军用飞机的工厂，其中一个工厂已经开始投入生产。而这一切“援助”正是在印度反动政府反华更加疯狂，在政治上和经济上面临重大困难并处于全面崩溃的时候，向印度提供的。事实上，这一援助的目的是要维持印度的反动政权，并唆使印度反动派反对中国及其邻国。
    苏联和日本领导人之间的日益广泛的接触和合作规模更大了，他们之间建立了多方面的亲密友谊。日本的垄断资本公司被邀请开发苏联远东的自然资源，日本飞机被允许从西伯利亚的这一端飞往另一端，即将签订一些重要的苏日合同和协定。这一切都不是偶然的。这是美帝国主义制订的和竭力支持的旨在反对和包围中华人民共和国的政治路线。
    最近的苏联—蒙古条约也是在同一个方面和为了同一个目的签订的，这个协定的反华性质是掩盖不了的。同样，赫鲁晓夫的继承者组织了和指挥了在塔什干举行的印度—巴基斯坦谈判，他们正在同泰国政府接近，对有蒋介石分子参加的美国的东南亚开发计划感兴趣，尽一切可能支持印度尼西亚反动派，以便镇压共产党人和其他革命力量，并唆使印度尼西亚反动派反对人民中国。在同屠杀印度尼西亚人民的刽子手进行亲切友好的谈判以后，十一月二十三日在莫斯科签订了印度尼西亚延期偿还对苏联的债务的协定，以及关于扩大两国之间贸易的协定。印度尼西亚军人集团要求苏联政府为刚刚运到印度尼西亚的苏联坦克提供零件。苏联驻印度尼西亚的外交代表公开赞扬印度尼西亚的法西斯政权，并宣扬加强“具有良好基础”的两国之间的关系。
    苏联的一切活动，以及其它的比较隐蔽的、或者说不公开的活动，都是为修正主义同美国和各国反动派结成联盟以便在军事上包围中国和为进行反华战争作好准备的这个凶恶大阴谋的组成部分。
    随着时间的推移，这一点就越来越明显：美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者之间协调一致，竭力利用越南问题来共同策划反华阴谋。他们妄想越南（分裂的或重新统一的）成为一个为帝国主义—修正主义包围中国而效劳的国家，成为一个推行积极反华政策的国家，成为反华战争中的固定的支柱。修正主义者想把越南问题的解决纳入苏美合作轨道的企图，正是为了达到这种目的。
    苏美在越南问题上玩弄的花招是很复杂的，但其目的是很明确的，同时，它们所起的作用也是很明确的。在这个花招中，美国人出武器，出军队，而修正主义者则充当破坏者，充当第五纵队，充当散布恐怖情绪的人，充当失败主义者。共同的目标就是从越南内部和外部来压倒越南，包围中国，把侵略朝着中国升级。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和各国帝国主义者之间在欧洲达成的妥协明显地揭示了苏美准备反华战争的战略目标。苏联修正主义领导人在“欧洲安全”的口号下，在美帝国主义者的赞同与推动下，走上了在欧洲进行绥靖、在亚洲进行侵略的道路。苏联领导人的这种新的“欧洲”政策，在最近华沙条约国布加勒斯特会议上已正式形成，这个政策的目的在于保证美帝国主义在欧洲无后顾之忧，在于帮助美帝国主义把它在欧洲的军队和装备调到亚洲，去加强在越南的军事行动和对中华人民共和国进行侵略。苏联修正主义者自己减轻了在欧洲的负担，从而开辟了把力量集中于亚洲战场的新的可能性。目前，苏美为统治世界而共同作战的锋芒，正是指向亚洲战场的。
    苏联关于在欧洲进行绥靖的宣传，或勃列日涅夫与柯西金最近进行的各次访问和策划的各种会议，恰巧发生在约翰逊的亚洲之行和马尼拉会议之际，这决不是偶然的。这些事态发展是在苏美高级代表举行一系列直接会谈之后出现的，同时美国的军事力量则从欧洲大量地调到越南和美国在亚洲的军事基地。正是在这些重大的外交阴谋活动之后，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者才发动新的反华宣传和宣称要召开“各国共产党”会议。帝国主义—修正主义者密切配合和加紧执行反华斗争的方针，是昭然若揭的，任何蛊惑人心的伎俩，任何欺骗手法，都是无法掩饰的。
    美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者陷入重重矛盾，这些矛盾反映了他们的虚弱
    从表面上看国际形势，似乎美帝国主义者和苏联领导人在产生影响，采取主动，急于利用形势和机会。然而，在这种复杂的形势下，帝国主义—修正主义者的虚弱却是再明显不过的。
    随着时间的推移，帝国主义国家之间的矛盾正在加剧和深化。在他们准备战争、缔结新联盟、争夺市场和势力范围的过程中，竞争和争夺不断加剧，美国失去了它在第二次大战后的短暂时间里在资本主义国家建立起来的霸权，它再也不能和没有任何实际可能重新组织资本主义的力量，并把其它帝国主义国家置于它的控制之下。这些国家，在侵略性条约中充当美国的主要伙伴，但现在却正在设法完全摆脱过去的美国经济、政治和军事方面的统治。现在，这些国家坚决要求在世界政治中占有自己的地位，在资本主义世界市场上有自己的一份。
    帝国主义国家之间的分歧，由于在对第三国采取共同政策和共同态度的问题上发生无休止的争吵而对北大西洋公约组织等侵略性条约造成的冲击，突出地暴露出来了。
    目前，美国在欧洲的霸权不仅仅受到法国资产阶级的反抗。法国觉得自己有充分的力量抗拒美国的命令和保卫自身的利益。西德也开始动摇起来，给它的大西洋彼岸的朋友造成了许多麻烦。这两个国家当然都根据自身的利益，要求重新缔结旧有的联盟和寻找新的市场，以对付美国的压力。在日本军国主义和英帝国主义那里，也或多或少地可以看出类似的现象。
    美国对其他各国人民奉行的干涉和侵略政策，使得它的那些不愿卷入美国的冒险的同盟者极为不安。这一政策在他们中间没有得到任何有效的支持。例如，美帝国主义者千方百计地要使它对越南的侵略国际化，但是，事实上它远远没有做到在朝鲜战争时期所做到的那样，那时它打着联合国的旗号还能够纠集一大批盟国。
    美国出名的记者李普曼最近在谈到美国目前的孤立处境以及它的欧洲同盟者不支持越南战争时写道：“任何一个欧洲国家的政府如果它在战场上和我们联合在一起，就不能生存下去。在‘道义上’支持我们的威尔逊政府会派遣少量部队去越南的这种幻想已经破灭了。至于我们认为在拯救他们的亚洲各国人民，任何一个亚洲的独立国家——日本、印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、马来亚和印度尼西亚——都没有给我们任何支持，那怕是象征性的支持。只有澳大利亚和新西兰那样的附属国家同我们在一起。它们是被前英帝国抛弃的前哨”。
    修正主义阵线自己也患了资本主义世界得的那种病。苏联领导人使用了各种办法和手段来填补越来越大的缺口。为了达到这个目的，他们利用卢布和使用压力、威胁和沙文主义的讹诈。但是，结果却是可悲的。
    苏联领导集团所奉行的沙文主义政策在它的追随者中间激起了狭隘民族主义情绪、不满、各种反抗和反对。每个修正主义集团为了竭力保卫自己的利益，总是不顾损害别人利益，设法建立自己的联盟。此外，为了行动自由并且作为对苏联进行讹诈的手段，许多集团用美元代替卢布，并且同西方建立了各种各样的关系。在这些对抗性的行动中和这场斗争中，是没有任何原则的。这是他们在本国使之复辟的资产阶级社会的法则在起作用，从而唤起了民族主义情绪，引起了无休止的争吵和没完没了的竞争。
    马克思列宁主义者对赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的无情揭露，使这种危机进一步加深和恶化。同时，这种揭露有助于增强共产党人和劳动人民的革命精神。在苏联，反修运动正在壮大，它表现为成立了秘密的革命委员会，同时在其它国家中，如在波兰，也成立了马克思列宁主义的革命党。在这些修正主义集团占统治地位的国家里，这些各种各样性质不同的因素，都是针对修正主义集团的烈火，根本上决定了它们不可避免的毁灭。
    马克思列宁主义政党和力量反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的斗争，世界各国成立的新的革命政党和革命组织，修正主义国家和修正主义党之间关系的削弱以及苏联修正主义者对于它们的影响的显著缩小，这一切都在继续发展。苏联领导人和其他修正主义集团不知所措，他们拚命摆脱从内部和外部折磨着他们的危机。面临着这种失败和在国际共产主义运动中的大暴露，面临着本国人民反抗他们所奉行的反马克思主义和投降的政策，面临着由于实行资本主义改革而出现的严重经济困难，于是他们就接二连三地举行秘密的或者公开的会议，以便寻找某种补救办法来摆脱夹住他们的巨大铁钳。
    勃列日涅夫修正主义集团要召开“共产主义国际会议”的目的
    在赫鲁晓夫修正主义者处境困难的情况下，勃列日涅夫和他的公开推销员呼吁召开“各国共产党”会议。迫使他们采取这种步骤的局势是不言而喻的，就像人们了解他们企图达到的目的和目标一样。
    第一，修正主义领导人企图掩盖他们的背叛的、反马克思主义的和投降主义的政策，掩饰他们同美帝国主义的靠拢和合作，掩盖在苏联复辟资本主义的政策。赫鲁晓夫分子需要这种“大规模的共产主义会议”，以便在十月社会主义革命五十周年的时候把它作为一项“伟大成就”，而他们已经在根本上叛变了和破坏了十月社会主义革命的理想和伟大事业。
    第二，他们希望通过这次会议增强他们在修正主义阵线中已经动摇的领导地位和加强正在分崩离析的修正主义者的队伍，即使不能真正加强，至少也要在表面上加强这个队伍。这次会议可能造成出席会议者同苏联领导人团结一致的表面现象。
    第三，他们主要企图通过这次会议打击中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，谴责它们是“教条主义者”、“分裂主义者”、“宗派主义者”等等。尽管勃列日涅夫保证不排除或谴责任何人，但是毫无疑问，会议的主要目的将是攻击马克思列宁主义政党、攻击它们的反帝反修的革命路线。最近在索非亚举行的世界工联理事会会议上发生了这样的可耻行径，在苏联修正主义者的唆使下把中国代表排斥在会议之外，而允许叛徒铁托分子参加会议，这就清楚地暴露了赫鲁晓夫分子的计划和阴谋。因此，这是勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流想在“共产主义国际会议”上搞的把戏的序幕。
    第四，苏联修正主义领导人企图在这里把他们反对中国、反对革命，同美帝国主义和世界反动派结盟和紧密合作的方针政策确定下来，作为正式的路线，并且更加热中地继续执行这一方针政策。
    苏联领导人认为自己已经发明了召开这次会议的蛊惑人心的骗人的论点，可以在会上重新展开讨论和作为会议的总的基础的论点，这就是现在大家都知道的那个口号：“团结一致，支援越南”。这个口号意味着必须在“反对美帝国主义的斗争中采取一致行动”。赫鲁晓夫修正主义的头目们把“声援越南”问题说成是“各国共产党”会议的基础，不言而喻，他们是根本不想支援越南人民抗击美国侵略的，他们自己也根本不想同美帝国主义作斗争。如果他们是反帝的共产党人，是革命者，他们不开这种会也完全可以支援越南，也可以同这个不只是赖在越南的帝国主义作斗争。
    不仅如此，苏联修正主义领导人及其盟友，不但不同帝国主义作斗争，反而在一切方面同屠杀越南人民的杀人犯美帝国主义者日益加紧勾结。这是多么伪善啊。正当勃列日涅夫及其追随者在保加利亚共产党代表大会和匈牙利社会主义工人党的代表大会上，大叫大嚷“一致行动”以及反对美帝国主义和“支持”越南的时候，这两个社会主义国家把它们同美国的外交关系提升为大使级。这一事实本身难道不是清楚地证明了，修正主义者是同屠杀越南人民的杀人犯美帝国主义者真正团结一致和一致行动的么？匈牙利社会主义工人党第一书记卡达尔甚至在代表大会的讲坛上说：“我们努力争取同美国的关系正常化，我们希望在政治、经济和科学等方面同美国建立关系。如果他们那方面表示有这样的愿望，那么我们的关系就可以改善。”他还说：“匈牙利已接受了美国的要求：在匈牙利社会主义工人党代表大会开幕的这一天宣布把我们的外交代表团提升为大使级的消息。”而且他把所有这种种做法说成是“一项原则性的政策，而不是策略”。实际上，只有背弃了一切原则的那些人才会执行这种“原则性”的政策。
    很显然，提出团结一致支援越南的问题，是修正主义的把戏，是对各国人民声援越南的真正感情进行卑鄙的投机，是在世界上所有正直的人们所关怀的一个问题上搞投机的把戏，是利用世界各地的人们对越南人民的侵略者的仇恨的一个阴谋。
      “越南问题”对苏联领导人来说是具有重大的策略意义的，因为在目前形势下，赫鲁晓夫分子只能利用这个问题来企图把形形色色的修正主义集团纠集在他们周围，他们只能在这个问题上装出某种团结的样子，进行蛊惑人心的宣传和欺骗舆论。
    此外，苏联领导人把“各国共产党”会议建立在越南问题这个基础上，希望这样就能“揭露”反对和拒绝参加这个修正主义的会议的中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，好像它们是反对团结一致支援越南人民和团结一致进行反对美帝国主义的斗争的。
    但是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者进行欺骗宣传，企图使人认为他们是反对美帝国主义的，这是枉费心机。他们作出关于“援助”越南的“共同决议”，这也是枉费心机。他们决不能歪曲事实和抹煞真象。阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民，中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，同全世界所有的革命人民一起，他们过去和现在都是完全团结一致的，他们过去和现在都是无保留地支持越南人民解放南方、保卫北方和统一祖国的正义斗争的。他们都坚决地谴责美帝国主义的武装侵略和“和谈”骗局。他们也毫不犹豫地揭露了苏联新领导人的骗人勾当。苏联新领导人一面假装支援越南人民，一面出卖越南人民，同美帝国主义狼狈为奸和策划阴谋，以迫使越南人民屈服。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者关于“社会主义国家团结反帝”和在越南问题上采取“联合行动”的卑鄙的骗人宣传，实际上是为了掩盖他们对越南人民的大背叛的一个阴谋。赫鲁晓夫的继承者装出支持越南或者反对美帝国主义的某些姿态，力图把越南问题纳入苏美合作的范围，纳入两大国主宰世界这条路线的范围。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者所关心的不是帮助越南人民，而是怎样出卖越南人民，所关心的不是怎样抗击美国，而是怎样支持美国。苏联领导人主要关心的事情，仅仅是怎样支持美国扩大对越南的侵略，把约翰逊关于“和平谈判”的讹诈强加于越南人民。这是主要的方面，因为美国在军事上和政治上的失败，以及人民战争在越南的胜利，也是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的大失败，是他们今后短期和长期战略的大失败。这种势力的利益和目标是同越南人民的、全世界人民的、革命的和各国人民反帝斗争的利益背道而驰的，同这样一种势力怎么能“联合行动”呢？
    苏联领导人大肆叫嚷并对天发誓，说什么，在越南问题上，他们完全赞成越南民主共和国政府和越南南方民族解放阵线的立场，他们没有采取特殊的态度。果真如此的话，那么为什么美帝国主义头目们及其盟友和代理人日复一日地同苏联修正主义头目们商谈和研究越南问题呢？为什么约翰逊、腊斯克、哈里曼、威尔逊、布朗、保罗·马丁、铁托、英迪拉·甘地和椎名悦三郎，且不谈帝国主义和反动派的其他许多代表以及他们的忠实代理人，在越南问题上求助于苏联领导人呢？难道他们那么天真，以致徒劳地去敲紧闭着的大门么？根本不是这么一回事。没有人会相信有这种天真的事。因此，有一点是明确的：在这些秘密的会晤和会谈中，策划了新的阴谋，进一步推行原先的阴谋，谋划了花招诡计，并且协调了反对越南和反对中国的共同行动。
    越南问题不仅不能像修正主义者所硬说的那样作为团结一致的基础，而且相反地是这样的根本问题之一，这个根本问题使修正主义者同马克思列宁主义者分离，使两者之间的斗争不可调和，使得所有的革命者以及所有真正站在越南人民一边的人们必须坚决地进行斗争，以彻底揭露作为帝国主义的同盟军和帮凶的赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的真面目。
    苏联修正主义者需要在现在召开一次“各国共产党”会议，还有另外的原因。他们怀着极大的恐惧看待中国最近的革命事件，了解到他们指望在中国发生有利于修正主义和有利于资本主义复辟的变化的希望落空了。由于中国共产党最近一个时期采取了彻底革命的措施，伟大的人民中国更加强大了，中国革命正沿着马克思列宁主义的正确道路顺利向前发展，它在世界上的影响越来越大。
    中国的无产阶级文化革命，是一场同人们头脑中的资产阶级思想和修正主义思想作斗争的革命，这场革命的矛头指向一切阶级敌人，指向公开的和隐蔽的修正主义分子；这些人企图使中国倒退，回到资本主义道路上去；这场革命的矛头是指向美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的，它从根本上动摇了各地的修正主义集团。中国的共产党员、工农兵和革命的红卫兵在这一伟大革命的旗帜下，按照毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的思想，正在铲除所有的毒草，揭露蜕化变质分子，揭露所有抱有修正主义观点的人——赫鲁晓夫分子的朋友和盟友，并粉碎了这些人最后的希望。然而中国最近的事件还不仅仅是对修正主义者的打击。
    中国的文化革命，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下正在蓬勃发展的挖掉产生修正主义根源的这场伟大革命运动，对于全世界的所有真正革命者是具有鼓舞作用的一个范例。对于苏联及其它被修正主义者篡夺了政权的国家的真正的共产党人和革命青年，这一范例尤其具有鼓舞和推动作用。它指出了同修正主义作斗争的道路，这就是采取革命的群众行动的道路，是发动群众揭露修正主义的背叛，横扫一切修正主义分子的道路。修正主义者所害怕的正是这一点：中国的范例有朝一日将在他们的国家产生影响。因此，为了抵制这一伟大的革命范例对他们所造成的危险，为了歪曲这一伟大的革命的真相和它的崇高的目的，修正主义者就同帝国主义一起，卑鄙无耻地诬蔑中国的文化革命。他们的报刊现在塞满了攻击中国共产党、攻击毛泽东同志、攻击中国共产党和毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义正确路线以及中国革命和中国人民的伟大成就的声明和文章。
    修正主义者现在打算就中国的文化革命和中国共产党中央委员会第十一次全体会议的决定，作出一个所谓“意识形态历史性文件”的共同决定。这个决定的内容会是什么样子，是不难预测的。它的纲领已经在《真理报》十一月二十七日的一篇题为《关于中国形势》的文章中提出，这篇文章充满了对中华人民共和国、中国共产党和中国领导人的诬蔑、造谣和恶毒的咒骂。
    这样，苏联修正主义领导人就暴露出，他们又扮演了同赫鲁晓夫一样的小丑，出场进行论战，以骗子的诬蔑和恶棍的咒骂来攻击社会主义和革命。现在正在维妙维肖地重演一九六四年的局面，当时赫鲁晓夫没有一天不攻击中华人民共和国，他在一些修正主义党的代表大会上勃然大怒，软硬兼施，要求举行臭名远扬的会议，来谴责中国共产党和把中国共产党驱逐出世界共产主义运动。
      《真理报》的文章，勃列日涅夫从保加利亚和匈牙利党的代表大会的讲坛上发出的关于召开一次新的修正主义党的会议的呼吁，在这次会议上中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党及其它忠于马克思列宁主义的党将“受到谴责”和“被排除”，苏联修正主义报刊和追随其后的某些国家的报刊进行的整个新的反华宣传，这种种事实本身就批驳了赫鲁晓夫垮台后苏联领导人的骗人的伎俩和阴谋。
    但是，正如赫鲁晓夫当时所证明的一样，这种种并不表明他们有力量，而是表明他们处境的虚弱，他们的无原则的斗争的破产和他们的骗人的伎俩的失败。苏联修正主义者想打败中国共产党和中华人民共和国的绝望企图，表明中国共产党和中华人民共和国，是修正主义者实现他们的反马克思主义和反社会主义的阴谋计划的不可逾越的障碍。他们攻击中国共产党，攻击阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，力图分离各国人民、革命者和我们这些党的马克思列宁主义者，企图孤立我们和使我们屈服。但是，他们实际上是暴露和孤立了自己，他们正在越来越加深把他们同共产主义运动和世界革命人民分开的鸿沟。
    为揭露赫鲁晓夫修正主义而坚决斗争是真正革命者的马克思列宁主义团结的唯一道路
    看来现在所有的修正主义者都同意按苏联领导集团提出的纲领召开“各国共产党”会议，尽管由于利益和各自的策略上的原因，他们同苏联修正主义者以及他们之间存在着严重的分歧。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者由于被揭露以及在对内和对外政策方面的失败而经历着非常严重的危机，相互之间的压力又非常剧烈，所以，对他们说来，召开一次国际会议是必需的，是势在必行的。竭力要重新建立对各修正主义集团的霸权、攻击中国和为他们同美帝国主义靠拢和合作的路线辩解的苏联领导人，正尽一切可能不错过这个机会。这次会议的“论据”是那么的“适合时宜”，以致每个修正主义集团都可以为自己的参加会议“辩护”，可以在表面上维护自己的“独立”和自己的“观点”。
    某些修正主义集团已经开始对召开这次会议的时机和会议议程表示怀疑。有一些人表示怀疑和犹豫，并且说，召开会议的条件“不成熟”，或者说还需要时间进行准备。另一些人说，召开会议嘛，可以！逐出教门嘛，不干。还有一些人公开支持苏联的计划并且说，条件“已经成熟”或“正在成熟”，没有理由再等待了。有一些人保持沉默，什么也不说。至于早已下决心干下去的苏联修正主义者，他们即使只同那些愿意参加的人一起，也可以举行会议。至于那些不去参加这次“盛会”的人，苏联领导人完全知道，他们是同意会议的目的的，这些人为了维护他们的所谓独立立场，不愿意公开同别人联合。苏联领导人对这些人的中间立场是十分高兴的和可以接受的，他们认为这种立场是对于马克思列宁主义者为揭露赫鲁晓夫修正主义者所进行的原则性斗争的破坏。这些人不参加这个会议，对他们来说，是坏处最少的。
    苏联修正主义者自己从历史经验中，知道什么是为他们的利益服务和符合他们利益的。他们知道，在共产主义运动中的中间立场是一个临时站，是走向机会主义和滑到马克思列宁主义叛徒立场上去的一个间歇。
    继去年三月会议以后，苏联修正主义领导人所策划的新的“各国共产党”会议，是为了进一步分裂国际共产主义运动，破坏各国人民反帝统一战线和破坏亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动的一个新的转移视线的行动。他们企图利用这个会议来进一步推行反华运动，把他们的修正主义思想和路线强加于共产主义运动，掩盖他们同美帝国主义的靠拢和合作，转移人们对他们所遭到的失败和揭露的注意。
    但是，苏联修正主义领导集团企图在“各国共产党”会议上玩弄的新把戏是注定要失败的。不管有没有这次会议，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的失败、必然到来的最后失败都是避免不了的。苏联共产党和国家的新领导集团将遭到和它的前任一样的不光彩的下场。任何花招，任何阴谋诡计，任何蛊惑人心的伎俩都改变不了它的暗淡的前景。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者通过他们的会议对马克思列宁主义者进行的挑战是吓不倒任何人的。恰恰相反，它将促使一切真正的共产党人、一切真正的革命者正确地分析形势和得出必要的结论，进一步加强反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的坚决斗争，毫不犹豫地揭露他们所策划的一切骗人的阴谋诡计。
    现在是同形形色色的现代修正主义者划清界线的时候了。叛徒修正主义者有朝一日会重新走上正道的希望已经没有了。现在一切方面都使马克思列宁主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者分开，没有任何东西使他们联合起来。他们不论在政治思想方面还是在最终目标方面，都是在根本相反的两极上。由于奉行反马克思主义的和投降的背信弃义的政策，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者已经把自己置于国际共产主义运动行列之外，置于反帝战线之外。
    我们党已公开宣布，今天摆在日程上的尖锐的现实问题，不是同修正主义者调和和团结，而是同他们彻底决裂。共产党人和革命者十分需要真正的团结，但是，通过像苏联修正主义者目前所策划的那种会议，是决计不能实现团结的。这种团结将在反对赫鲁晓夫的、铁托的和形形色色的现代修正主义的斗争中，并在经过考验的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上建立起来。
    我们党在许多材料和文件中，特别是在恩维尔·霍查同志在党的第五次代表大会上所作的关于阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会的工作报告中，表示了对于在目前形势下共产主义运动所面临的历史任务，尤其是对于反对修正主义的斗争所采取的原则立场。
    恩维尔·霍查同志在报告中说：“世界和国际共产主义运动的形势正在朝着有利于我们而不利于敌人的方向发展。但是，必须正视这种形势，勇敢地对付这种形势，因为帝国主义和修正主义这些敌人尽管遭到了失败，但他们并没有放下武器。相反地，他们正在加紧勾结和进行活动。对于这种形势，决不容许示弱、犹豫和动摇不定，而要求果敢、坚决和老练，不容许采取宽大、软弱和机会主义的策略和空发议论，而要求采取迅速和战斗的行动，要求采取每日每时都有利于我们革命战略的战斗策略，也就是根据各个党所处的战斗形势和情况确定英明的、慎重的策略。毫无疑问，有了建立在我们战无不胜的思想的基础上的革命战略和策略，马克思列宁主义政党和力量将勇往直前，并同工人阶级、被压迫人民和被压迫民族一起，在反对帝国主义和修正主义、争取马克思列宁主义、社会主义、革命和世界和平事业胜利的神圣斗争中取得新的胜利。”
