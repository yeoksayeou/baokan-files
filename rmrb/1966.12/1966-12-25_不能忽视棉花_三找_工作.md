Title: The Importance of Cotton "Three Find" Work Cannot Be Neglected

The importance of the cotton "three find" work (finding fallen flowers, unopened flowers, and withered flowers) is often overlooked by many rural cadres. Their reasoning is that after the cotton has been picked, the "three find" work yields little benefit.

Is it true that the "three find" work yields little benefit? From what I have observed, it is not that the benefits are small, but rather that they are quite significant! In our commune and some neighboring communes, the average yield per mu (a unit of area) for the "three find" work is between four to nine jin (a unit of weight), with some production teams and brigades yielding over ten jin. Can this be considered a small benefit?

Currently, it is the crucial time to vigorously promote the "three find" work for cotton. I suggest that relevant units quickly take up this task and absolutely must not overlook it.

    不能忽视棉花“三找”工作
    如何做好棉花“三找”工作（找落地花、眼粢花、僵瓣花），是不少农村干部不太注意的问题。他们的理由是：棉花采摘光了，“三找棉”油水不大了。
    是不是“三找棉”油水不大？据我了解，不是油水不大，而是油水大得很！就我们公社和一些兄弟公社的情况来看，一般每亩有“三找棉”四五斤到八九斤，少数的生产队、大队在十斤以上。这能说油水不大吗？
    现在正是狠抓、猛抓棉花“三找”工作的时候。建议有关单位迅速把这一工作抓起来，千万千万不能忽视。
