The Soviet revisionists have once again served U.S. imperialism by manipulating the World Federation of Trade Unions to launch a frenzied anti-China campaign.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on the 11th, the editorial board of the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" today published an article severely condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership and its followers for illegally depriving the Chinese trade union delegation of its right to participate in the 16th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The article points out that this is yet another crime committed by the Soviet revisionists and their followers against the great Chinese people and the Chinese working class.

The article states that the Khrushchev revisionists and the leaders of the World Federation of Trade Unions under their command have persisted in their splitist activities, attempting to impose their policy of betrayal and capitulation, their line of opposing the international working class, the Communist Party, revolution, and their pro-imperialist stance on this organization. At this meeting, they blatantly violated all democratic norms and forcibly passed a brutal resolution to deprive the Chinese trade union delegation of its legitimate right to participate in the meeting. This is a new crime against the great Chinese people and the Chinese working class, and it is another service rendered by the modern revisionists to U.S. imperialism and international reactionaries. The Khrushchev revisionists and their followers are so frantically anti-China because they are terrified by the great victories achieved by the Chinese people on the socialist road and by the great proletarian cultural revolution currently being successfully carried out in China.

The article says that no matter how the Khrushchev revisionists and their followers struggle and engage in sabotage, they will never be able to defile the heroic Chinese working class and the great Chinese people, nor will they be able to stop them from advancing towards the highest peaks of socialism, nor will they be able to stop the struggle of the Chinese people. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class, Chinese trade unions, and the seven hundred million Chinese people have always firmly and unshakably held high the banner of proletarian revolution and the liberation of the oppressed peoples of all countries.

The article states that the Khrushchev revisionists and their followers shout about "unity" but engage in splitist activities.

The article concludes by saying that the Albanian trade union delegation attending the 16th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions regards it as their sacred duty to firmly oppose the line of capitulation and the despicable splitist activities of the Khrushchev revisionists and their followers within the World Federation of Trade Unions. The principled stance of the Albanian trade union delegation is a testament to the courageous and uncompromising struggle for the just cause of genuine unity within the World Federation of Trade Unions, and it is another blow to the enemies of the working class—the imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists and their followers.

    苏修对美帝国主义的又一次效劳
    阿《人民之声报》谴责苏修操纵世界工联疯狂反华
    据新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》今天发表编辑部文章，严厉谴责苏联修正主义领导集团及其追随者非法剥夺中国工会代表团参加世界工联第十六次理事会会议的权利。文章指出，这是苏联修正主义者及其追随者反对伟大的中国人民、中国工人阶级的又一新的罪行。
    文章说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者以及在他们指挥下的世界工联领导人坚持分裂活动，企图把他们的背叛和投降政策，把他们的反对国际工人阶级、反对共产党、反对革命和亲帝国主义的路线强加给这个组织。在这次会议上，他们公然违反一切民主准则，强行通过了剥夺中国工会代表团参加会议的合法权利的蛮横决定。这是反对伟大的中国人民、中国工人阶级的新罪行，是现代修正主义者对美帝国主义和国际反动派的又一次效劳。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其追随者，所以这样拚命地疯狂地反华，这是因为他们被中国人民在社会主义道路上所取得的伟大胜利，被中国正在胜利地开展着的无产阶级文化大革命吓破了胆。
    文章说，不管赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其追随者如何挣扎和进行破坏活动，他们永远也不可能沾污英雄的中国工人阶级和伟大的中国人民，永远也阻挡不住他们朝着社会主义的最高峰乘胜前进，永远也阻挡不住中国人民的斗争。在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党英明领导下的中国工人阶级、中国工会以及七亿中国人民，一贯坚定不移地高举无产阶级革命和各国被压迫人民解放事业的旗帜。
    文章说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其追随者大叫大嚷着“团结”，但是干的却是分裂勾当。
    文章最后说，出席世界工联第十六次理事会会议的阿尔巴尼亚工会代表团，把坚决反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其在世界工联组织中的追随者的投降路线和卑鄙无耻的分裂活动的斗争，看作是自己的神圣义务。阿尔巴尼亚工会代表团的原则性立场是勇敢地、毫不妥协地争取世界工联真正团结的正义斗争的见证，是对工人阶级的敌人——帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其追随者的又一打击。
