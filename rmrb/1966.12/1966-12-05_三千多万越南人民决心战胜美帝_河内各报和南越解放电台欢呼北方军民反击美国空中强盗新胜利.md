Hanoi newspapers and the South Vietnamese Liberation Radio Station celebrate the new victory of the northern military and civilians in counterattacking American air pirates

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 3rd: Hanoi newspapers published editorials on the 3rd, strongly condemning the savage crime of American pirate planes bombing the residential areas of Hanoi, and warmly praising the glorious victory of the Hanoi military and civilians and the military and civilians of other places in North Vietnam on the 2nd, shooting down 12 American pirate planes and capturing many American pilots. The editorials called on the military and civilians of North Vietnam to maintain vigilance and give the American aggressors even heavier blows, smashing their new "escalation" actions.

The editorial of the People's Daily said that the great victory on December 2nd proved that the Vietnamese military and civilians have maintained high vigilance, prepared well, and struck back at the enemy in a timely manner. In many places, the enemy planes were shot down as soon as they intruded into the airspace.

The editorial said that the victory on the 2nd showed that the Vietnamese military and civilians have made new progress in tactics, technology, command of battles, service for battles, and capturing American pilots. No matter where the enemy planes come from, they are met with fierce counterattacks by the Vietnamese military and civilians. No matter where American pilots parachute, they are surrounded and captured by the Vietnamese military and civilians.

The editorial finally called on the Vietnamese military and civilians to continue to maintain vigilance, be ready at any time to give the American aggressors even heavier blows, and achieve even greater victories.

The editorial of the Hanoi Capital Daily said that no matter what tricks the American aggressors play or how much they intensify their bombing, the Vietnamese military and civilians will resolutely give them even fiercer counterattacks and strive for even greater and more glorious victories.

The editorial of the New Vietnam Chinese Daily pointed out that the 31 million heroic people of Vietnam resolutely respond to Chairman Hu's call, fearing neither hardship nor sacrifice, and are determined to carry the struggle against the Americans and for national salvation to the end.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 4th: The People's Army Daily of Vietnam published an editorial on the 4th, warmly praising the glorious victory of the military and civilians of North Vietnam on the 2nd, shooting down 12 American pirate planes, and called on the military and civilians of North Vietnam to continue to maintain vigilance, constantly improve their combat effectiveness, and resolve to defeat the American aggressors.

The editorial said that the glorious achievements of December 2nd are another brilliant manifestation of the revolutionary heroism, decisive will to win, high vigilance, and readiness for battle of our military and civilians.

The editorial emphasized that the American aggressors' new escalation of the war once again exposed their extremely savage nature of aggression. Just as Johnson's people were running around everywhere, peddling the phony "peace talks" merchandise, the serious war actions taken by the American aggressors against North Vietnam on December 2nd continued to expose the policy of fake peace and real war of the war-mongering American imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 4th: The South Vietnamese Liberation Radio Station published a commentary on the 3rd, warmly celebrating the glorious victory of the military and civilians of North Vietnam on the 2nd in the battle against the savage attacks of American pirate planes on Hanoi.

The commentary pointed out that the American aggressors taking such crazy actions cannot escape the fate of suffering heavy blows from the northern military and civilians the more they cause trouble.

The commentary said, "The great victory of the northern military and civilians on December 2nd greatly encouraged the southern military and civilians and strengthened the firm belief of the people of the whole country in the inevitability of victory in the struggle against the Americans and for national salvation."

The commentary said, "The American aggressors invading our beloved North not only received the punishment they deserved from the northern military and civilians but also further aroused the deep hatred of the southern military and civilians towards the American aggressors, making the southern military and civilians more determined to rise up and annihilate more American aggressors and their lackeys."

The commentary said, "Facing the brutal and rampant invaders, the military and civilians of South and North Vietnam must more than ever remember Chairman Hu's teachings, actively respond to the call of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, carry forward the victories achieved in the early dry season, continue to give the American aggressors and their lackeys heavy blows, and thwart all their vile plots."

    三千多万越南人民决心战胜美帝
    河内各报和南越解放电台欢呼北方军民反击美国空中强盗新胜利
    据新华社河内三日电　河内各报三日纷纷发表社论，严厉谴责美国强盗飞机轰炸河内市居民区的野蛮罪行，并且热烈赞扬河内军民和越南北方其他地方军民二日一举击落美国强盗飞机十二架，活捉许多美国飞行员的辉煌胜利。各报社论号召越南北方军民，继续保持警惕，给美国侵略强盗以更加沉重的打击，粉碎它的新的战争“升级”行动。
    《人民报》社论说，十二月二日取得的巨大胜利证明，越南军民保持了高度警惕，作好准备，及时地给敌人以猛烈还击。在许多地方，敌机刚窜犯领空，就被打得粉身碎骨。
    社论说，二日的胜利表明，越南军民在战术、技术、指挥战斗、为战斗服务和围捕美国飞行员等方面有了新的进步。不论敌机从哪里来，都遭到越南军民猛烈的还击。不论美国飞行员跳伞降落到什么地方，都被越南军民围捕和一网打尽。
    社论最后号召越南军民必须继续提高警惕，随时准备给美国强盗更沉重的打击，夺取更加巨大的胜利。
    《首都河内报》的社论说，不管美国强盗玩弄什么手段，加强轰炸到什么程度，越南军民也坚决给它以更加猛烈的还击，决心争取更加巨大和辉煌的胜利。
    《新越华报》的社论指出，越南三千一百万英雄人民坚决响应胡主席的号召，不畏艰苦、不怕牺牲，坚决把抗美救国斗争进行到底。
    据新华社河内四日电　越南《人民军队报》四日发表社论，热烈赞扬越南北方军民二日击落美国强盗飞机十二架的辉煌胜利，号召越南北方军民继续保持警惕，不断提高战斗力，决心战胜美国侵略强盗。
    社论说，十二月二日的辉煌战果，是我国军民的革命英雄主义、决战决胜意志、高度的警惕性和战备精神的又一光辉表现。
    社论强调指出，美国强盗的新的战争升级行动，又一次暴露了它的极其野蛮的侵略本质。正当约翰逊派人四处奔走，兜售骗人的“和平谈判”冷货的时候，美国强盗十二月二日对越南北方采取的严重的战争行动，继续暴露出好战的美帝国主义的假和平、真战争的政策。
    新华社河内四日电　越南南方解放电台三日发表评论，热烈欢呼越南北方军民二日在反击美国强盗飞机野蛮袭击河内的战斗中取得的辉煌胜利。
    评论指出，美国强盗采取这种疯狂的行动，决不能摆脱越捣乱就越遭到北方军民的沉重打击的命运。
    评论说，“北方军民十二月二日的巨大胜利，大大地鼓舞了南方军民，加强了全国人民对抗美救国事业必胜的坚定信心。”
    评论说，“美国强盗侵犯我们亲爱的北方，不但遭到北方军民应有的惩罚，而且更加激起南方军民对美国强盗的深刻仇恨，使南方军民更坚决地奋起消灭更多的美国强盗和它的走狗。”
    评论说，“面临着残暴和猖狂的侵略者，越南南北两方军民比过去任何时候都更要牢牢记住胡主席的教导，积极响应越南南方民族解放阵线的号召，发扬在旱季初期取得的胜利，继续给美国强盗和它的走狗以沉重的打击，挫败它们的一切卑鄙阴谋。”
