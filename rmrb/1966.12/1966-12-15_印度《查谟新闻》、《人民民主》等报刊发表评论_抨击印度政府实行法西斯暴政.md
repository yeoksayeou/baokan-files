Indian newspapers *Kashmir News* and *People's Democracy* have published commentaries criticizing the Indian government for extending the "Preventive Detention Act" for the seventh time, accusing the Congress Party government of implementing fascist tyranny and intensifying the suppression of the people.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, New Delhi: Some Indian newspapers have commented on the issue of the Indian reactionary ruling clique extending the validity period of the "Preventive Detention Act" for the seventh time, criticizing the Congress Party government for implementing fascist tyranny and intensifying the suppression of the people.

The Urdu weekly *Kashmir News* and the Punjabi weekly *People's Democracy* recently published commentaries pointing out that the Congress Party government is turning India into a dictatorial police state, which is the greatest threat to democracy. To defend democracy and the interests of the people, the only way is for the Indian people to unite and resolutely fight against the anti-people and anti-democratic policies of the Congress Party government.

The commentary in *Kashmir News* pointed out: "Today, there is no city in India that is not suffering from police brutality. People from all walks of life—teachers, professors, students, lawyers, doctors, workers, peasants, employees, and shopkeepers—have all suffered under police rule..."

The commentary, while calling on the people to rise up and fight against the tyranny of the Congress Party government, pointed out: "The people are the decisive force. As long as the people are organized and rely on the people, even the strongest enemy can be defeated."

The commentary in the Punjabi weekly *People's Democracy* said that the Congress Party government continues to implement the "Defense of India Rules," maintain the "state of emergency," and repeatedly extend the implementation period of the "Preventive Detention Act" to use these reactionary laws to suppress the people and protect the interests of the big bourgeoisie and landlord class.

The commentary concluded by calling on the Indian people to unite and fight against the fascist dictatorship of the Congress Party.

    抨击印度政府实行法西斯暴政
    据新华社十一日讯新德里消息：印度的一些报刊就印度反动统治集团第七次延长“预防拘留法”有效期限的问题发表评论，抨击国大党政府实行法西斯暴政，加紧镇压人民。
    乌尔都文周刊《查谟新闻》和旁遮普《人民民主》周刊最近都发表评论指出：国大党政府正在把印度变成一个独裁的警察国家，它是对民主的最大的威胁，印度人民要保卫民主和人民利益，唯一的办法就是团结一致地同国大党政府的反人民、反民主的政策展开坚决斗争。
    《查谟新闻》的评论指出：“今天，印度没有一个城镇不受警察暴行之害。各阶层人民——教员、教授、学生、律师、医生、工人、农民、雇员和店员——都吃尽了警察统治的苦头……。”
    评论在号召人民起来展开反对国大党政府暴政时指出：“人民是决定性的力量，只要把人民组织起来和依靠人民，就能够打倒即使是最强大的敌人。”
    旁遮普《人民民主》周刊的评论说，国大党政府继续实行“保卫印度条例”、保持“紧急状态”和一再延长“预防拘留法”实施期限，是想借助于这些反动法律来镇压人民，保护大资产阶级和大地主阶级的私利。
    评论最后号召印度人民团结起来反对国大党的法西斯独裁统治。
