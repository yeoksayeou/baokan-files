According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tokyo: Just as U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique are singing in unison, hastening to carry out their "bombing for peace" conspiracy on the Vietnam issue, Sato Eisaku on December 15th delivered a speech at a plenary session of the House of Representatives. He avoided mentioning the heinous aggression of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam. He put on a "fair" face, speaking for his American master, saying, "The most important thing is that all parties involved in this struggle should first stop fighting."

    掩盖美帝侵略罪行，鼓吹“停止战斗”
    据新华社讯　东京消息：正当美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团在越南问题上一唱一和，加紧进行“以炸迫和”的无耻勾当时，佐藤荣作十五日在众议院全体会议上发表讲话，避而不谈美帝国主义对越南的罪恶滔天的侵略行动。他装出一副“公正”的面孔，为他的美国主子帮腔，说什么“最重要的是所有卷入这一场斗争的双方，应当首先停止战斗”。
