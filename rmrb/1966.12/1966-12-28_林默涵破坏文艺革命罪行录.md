	Lin Mo-han, the second-in-command of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Chou Yang, during his tenure as deputy minister of the former Propaganda Department and deputy minister of the former Ministry of Culture, has been frantically resisting and sabotaging the literary and artistic revolution, committing heinous crimes.

		Publicly defying Chairman Mao's instructions

		In 1963, Chairman Mao issued several important instructions to the literary and artistic circles. Chairman Mao said: Many departments are still dominated by "dead men." Many Communist Party members enthusiastically promote feudal and capitalist art, but do not enthusiastically promote socialist art. Isn't this astonishing? Regarding Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lin Mo-han not only refused to carry them out but also sneered, saying, "The Chairman only said that one sentence." He even said that Chairman Mao's criticism of the former Ministry of Culture was a "joke" and "need not be passed down." Lin Mo-han dared to treat the highest instructions in this manner, truly daring and mad to the extreme!

		The malicious "one segment" theory

		Comrade Chiang Ching, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, personally oversaw the performance of modern Beijing opera and focused on dramas such as "The Red Lantern," "Shachihuang," and "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," setting a model for Beijing opera to portray revolutionary life, opening up a path for the Beijing opera revolution, and driving the revolution in the literary and artistic circles, achieving epoch-making results.

		However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lin Mo-han hated this deeply and tried every means to resist and sabotage it. On the eve of the national modern Beijing opera performance in 1964, he spoke at length about the "division of labor" theory at a meeting of the Propaganda Department's literary section. He openly shouted, "We should perform modern dramas for a while, but we should also perform traditional dramas!" He maliciously said, "We do not exclude traditional dramas, especially not those with new perspectives on historical dramas." His sinister purpose was to use traditional and historical dramas to squeeze out and kill revolutionary modern dramas!

		Poison arrows aimed at "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy"

		During the Beijing opera performance, after the Shanghai delegation performed "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," someone wrote an article in the newspaper, shooting poison arrows and pouring cold water on this drama. The achievements of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" in its adaptation and creation are outstanding, created under the leadership of comrades such as Kao Ching-shih. The purpose of attacking "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" was not to attack this drama but to attempt to sabotage the Beijing opera revolution. This article was written under Lin Mo-han's instructions and the draft was personally revised by him.

		A malicious wind blowing against "The Red Lantern"

		The plots of the former Propaganda Department, former Ministry of Culture, and former Beijing Municipal Committee to obstruct and sabotage the Beijing opera revolution have one by one been exposed. Dramas such as "Shachihuang," "The Red Lantern," and "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" have been warmly praised by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and many Beijing opera troupes and local opera troupes have enthusiastically adapted them. This is a great thing, but Lin Mo-han strongly opposed it. In a meeting, he openly said, "The Red Lantern is good, but it's not good if it's all 'The Red Lantern'." Lin Mo-han and his ilk, in order to oppose the Beijing opera revolution, blew a malicious wind to extinguish the "red lantern." But things did not develop according to their wishes. Now, several opera genres across the country have adapted "The Red Lantern." We believe that with the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, more "Red Lanterns" will be created, and the "red lantern" will illuminate every stage!

### 林默涵破坏文艺革命罪行录

    林默涵破坏文艺革命罪行录
    周扬反革命修正主义集团的二号头目林默涵，在他窃踞旧中宣部副部长、旧文化部副部长职位期间，一直疯狂地抵制和破坏文艺革命，犯下了滔天罪行。
      公开抗拒毛主席的指示
    一九六三年，毛主席对文艺界发出过多次重要的指示，毛主席说：许多部门至今还是“死人”统治着。许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。对于毛主席的极为重要的指示，反革命修正主义分子林默涵不但拒不执行，还蔑视地说：“主席不过讲了那么一句话。”还说毛主席对旧文化部的批评是“开玩笑”，“不必向下传达”。林默涵竟敢这样对待最高指示，真是胆大包天，疯狂到了极点！
      居心险恶的“一段”论
    江青同志根据毛主席指示精神，亲自抓京剧现代戏会演，并且重点抓《红灯记》《沙家浜》《智取威虎山》等剧目，为京剧表现革命生活树立了样板，为京剧革命开辟了道路，并且带动了文艺界的革命，取得了划时代的成就。
    可是，反革命修正主义分子林默涵却恨之入骨，千方百计进行抗拒和破坏。在一九六四年全国京剧现代戏会演前夕，他在中宣部文艺处的一次会上大谈“分工论”。公开叫嚷“现代戏搞一段，还要搞传统戏嘛！”胡说什么“不排斥传统戏，特别不排斥新观点的历史戏”。他阴险的目的就是要用传统戏、历史戏来挤掉和压死革命现代戏！
      向《智取威虎山》放毒箭
    在京剧会演期间，上海代表团演出《智取威虎山》之后，有人在报纸上写文章，对这出戏大放毒箭，大泼冷水。《智取威虎山》这出戏在改编、创作上的成就是十分突出的，是在柯庆施等负责同志领导下创作出来的。打击《智取威虎山》，目的决不在于打击这一出戏，而是妄图破坏京剧革命。这篇文章就是在林默涵的授意下写出来的，发表的稿子是经过他亲自修改的。
        一股吹向“红灯”的妖风
    旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委阻挠破坏京剧革命的阴谋一个一个的破产了。《沙家浜》、《红灯记》《智取威虎山》等样板戏受到了广大工农兵群众的热烈赞扬，许多京剧团和地方戏曲剧团都纷纷移植。本来是件大好事，可是林默涵却极力反对，他在一次会议上公开说：“《红灯记》好是好，都是《红灯记》就不好了。”林默涵之流为了反对京剧革命，吹起了一股扑灭“红灯”的妖风。但事物不按照他们的意愿发展，现在全国已有几个剧种都移植了《红灯记》，我们相信随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，将创造出更多的《红灯记》，让“红灯”照亮每一个舞台！
