The Albanian National Song and Dance Troupe today, while visiting the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing, celebrated together with the commune members the success of China's latest nuclear weapon test.

The artistic comrades from the front lines against imperialism and revisionism were particularly excited today. They eagerly picked up the *People's Daily* with the good news and passed it among themselves, enthusiastically congratulating their Chinese comrades. The deputy director of the troupe, Ro Hadjo, excitedly told everyone at the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune: "The great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and the successful conduct of another nuclear test are powerful proof. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is your achievement, and it is also our achievement, the achievement of our comrades and friends."

The Albanian artistic warriors received a very warm welcome at the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune. People held up red copies of *Quotations from Chairman Mao*, beat drums, and continuously shouted slogans: "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong," "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the Party of Labour of Albania!"

The Albanian comrades arrived at the fields of the Sunrise Production Brigade. They immediately took off their shirts, some with hoes and others with wheelbarrows, and joyfully worked alongside the commune members.

    文化大革命获巨大胜利又一证明
    据新华社二十九日讯阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团今天在访问北京郊区中阿友好人民公社时，同社员们一起热烈欢呼我国又一次核武器爆炸成功。
    来自反帝反修前线的文艺战友们今天特别兴奋，他们一早就拿着《人民日报》喜报，相互传阅，向中国同志热情祝贺。歌舞团副团长罗·哈多在中阿友好人民公社激动地对大家说：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命获得巨大胜利，又一次成功地进行了新的核爆炸就是有力证明。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！这是你们的成绩，也是我们、我们的同志和朋友的成绩。”
    阿尔巴尼亚文艺战士们在中阿友好人民公社，受到了公社社员们极其热烈的欢迎。人们高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，敲锣打鼓，不断高呼：“毛泽东—恩维尔”“恩维尔—毛泽东”、“中国共产党万岁！”“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”
    阿尔巴尼亚战友们来到向阳大队田间，他们立即脱去上衣，有的拿镐，有的推车，和社员们一起欢快地劳动起来。
