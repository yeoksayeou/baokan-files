According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 30th, the head of the Chinese delegation to the Fifth Congress of International Agricultural and Forestry Workers said in an interview with a Xinhua reporter that at this congress, the Chinese delegation, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, together with other representatives who insist on opposing imperialism and modern revisionism and adhering to the line of class struggle, engaged in a face-to-face struggle with the Soviet revisionists who advocate the line of "peaceful coexistence" and class capitulation. They powerfully exposed the ugly face of the Soviet leadership as the henchmen and traitors of U.S. imperialism.

This congress was held in Berlin from November 8th to 12th.

The head of the Chinese delegation said that the general report of this congress and the resolution on the Vietnam issue, which was forcibly passed under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionists, did not support the "Call by Chairman Ho Chi Minh," nor did it support the Vietnamese people's resolute stance of fighting to the end until all U.S. aggressors are thoroughly driven out of Vietnam. The general report also served the conspiracy of "peace talks" plotted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. After the Chinese delegation made a sharp exposure and criticism of this, the head of the Soviet delegation even maliciously attacked China in his speech, saying that "the Chinese leaders' rejection of the proposals for joint action from other socialist countries actually helps U.S. imperialism and reactionary forces around the world." The Chinese delegation gave a resolute rebuff to such blatant anti-China behavior and cited numerous facts to expose the Soviet leadership's various crimes of trying in every way to serve the U.S.'s "peace talks" hoax and attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. They pointed out that it is the Soviet leadership itself that is helping U.S. imperialism. To engage in "joint action" with the Soviet leadership is to join hands with U.S. imperialism and betray the Vietnamese people. The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never engage in any "joint action" with them but will fight them to the end. The Soviet revisionists, feeling guilty as thieves, were refuted to the point of being speechless, fully exposing their traitorous face of false support and true betrayal on the Vietnam issue.

The head of the Chinese delegation said that under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionists, the general report of the congress advocated that seeking "peaceful coexistence" is the highest interest of mankind. The general report, departing from the struggle against imperialism, talked extensively about land reform, claiming that land reform is of decisive significance to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and that workers in capitalist countries can push the monopolistic capitalist government to nationalize land and help farmers organize cooperatives. These fallacies were strongly refuted by many representatives. The representative from Ceylon, Ramiah, said that the workers of the world cannot coexist peacefully with U.S. imperialism; our task is to establish a united front of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and build a new civilization on the basis of burying U.S. imperialism. The representative from Indonesia pointed out that the enemy will not lay down their weapons voluntarily, and the working class cannot achieve revolutionary victory through peaceful means.

The head of the Chinese delegation said that at this congress, the Soviet revisionists, in organizational matters, vigorously excluded the chairman of the Indonesian Forestry Workers' Union, Jukito, who was bravely fighting under white terror, from continuing to serve as the president of the International Agricultural and Forestry Workers' Union, and refused to recognize Jukito's representative to exercise the president's powers. They also obstructed the general secretary of the Ceylon Plantation Workers' Union, Samugadasan, from continuing to serve as a member of the administrative committee, and excluded the general secretary of the All-India Kisan Sabha, Rayalpur, who was persecuted by the Indian reactionaries, from continuing to serve as the vice-president of the International Agricultural and Forestry Workers' Union. The Soviet revisionists' fake unity and true division, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries to persecute progressive forces, aroused the dissatisfaction and opposition of many representatives. The representatives from Indonesia and Ceylon successively issued statements, angrily condemning the Soviet revisionists' hypocritical respect for Jukito and Samugadasan while actually excluding and attacking them. The Chinese delegation solemnly pointed out that this congress's exclusion of progressive forces from Indonesia, India, Ceylon, and other countries in the leadership of the International Workers' Union is a concrete evidence of the Soviet leadership's collusion with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries in various countries to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Such counter-revolutionary behavior will inevitably be punished by history.

The head of the Chinese delegation pointed out that at this congress, the Soviet revisionists even used the general report of the congress to refer to China's sacred and indivisible territory, Hong Kong, as a "country." They also used slander, bribery, and other despicable means to incite the delegates to anti-China sentiment. At the same time, they used undemocratic means such as turning off the loudspeakers and creating disturbances to prevent the Chinese delegation from speaking.

The head of the Chinese delegation said that the vast majority of representatives from Asia, Africa, and Latin America resolutely opposed the Soviet revisionists' incitement to anti-China sentiment and expressed friendship towards China. Many people praised and admired Mao Zedong Thought and China's stance. The representative from Ceylon, Ramiah, highly evaluated the Chinese revolution at the plenary meeting, emphasizing that "Lenin opened the path of the October Revolution, and Comrade Mao Zedong led the Chinese revolution to continue and develop this path, which is the path of the world's people's revolution." An African representative said, "Mao Zedong Thought has great significance for the revolution in Asia, Africa, and Latin America," and "China's line is completely correct." Some representatives expressed their support for "China's line" and "admiration for China's revolutionary stance." Inside and outside the venue, many people voluntarily asked the Chinese delegation for Chairman Mao's portraits and "Quotations from Chairman Mao." All this shows that Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly becoming the strongest and sharpest ideological weapon for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and for the people of the world.

    我出席国际农林工人代表会议代表团负责人发表谈话指出
    苏修勾结美帝镇压革命必遭历史惩罚
    他们竭力为美帝效劳排斥和打击进步力量暴露出叛徒和工贼面目
    据新华社三十日讯　出席国际农林、种植园工人第五次代表会议的中国农林工会代表团负责人向新华社记者发表谈话说，在这次会议上，中国代表团高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，和其他坚持反对帝国主义和现代修正主义，坚持阶级斗争路线的代表一起，同推行“和平共处”、阶级投降路线的苏联修正主义者进行了针锋相对的斗争，有力地揭露了苏联领导集团作为美帝国主义的帮凶和工贼的丑恶面目。
    这次会议是在十一月八日到十二日在柏林举行的。
    中国代表团负责人说，这次会议的总报告和在苏联修正主义者操纵下强行通过的越南问题决议，根本不支持《胡志明主席号召书》，不支持越南人民打到底，直到把美国侵略者全部彻底赶出越南的严正立场。总报告还为美苏策划的“和谈”阴谋效劳。在中国代表团对此进行了尖锐的揭露和批判之后，苏联代表团团长竟然在发言中恶毒地攻击中国，说什么“中国领导人拒绝其他社会主义国家关于联合行动的建议，这种态度实际上帮助了美帝国主义和世界上的反动势力。”中国代表团对这种明目张胆的反华行为给予了坚决的回击，并列举大量事实，揭露了苏联领导千方百计地为美国的“和谈”骗局效劳，妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的烈火的种种罪行。指出为美帝国主义帮忙的正是苏联领导集团自己。同苏联领导集团搞“联合行动”就是同美帝国主义联合，出卖越南人民。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，决不同他们搞什么“联合行动”，而是要同他们坚决斗争到底。苏联修正主义者作贼心虚，被驳得哑口无言，充分暴露了他们在越南问题上的假支持、真出卖的叛徒面目。
    中国代表团负责人说，在苏联修正主义者操纵下，会议的总报告宣扬争取“和平共处”“是人类至高无上利益的斗争”。总报告离开反帝斗争，大谈土地改革，胡说什么土地改革对亚非拉人民具有决定性意义，说什么资本主义国家工人能够推动垄断资本政权把土地国有化，帮助农民组织合作化。这些谬论遭到了不少代表的有力驳斥。锡兰代表拉米亚说，全世界工人决不能同美帝国主义和平共处，我们的任务是建立全世界人民的反美统一战线，在埋葬美帝国主义的基础上建立新的文明。印度尼西亚代表指出，敌人是不会自动放下武器的，工人阶级取得革命胜利不能通过和平途径。
    中国代表团负责人说，在这次会议上，苏联修正主义者在组织问题上极力排斥正在白色恐怖下进行英勇斗争的印度尼西亚林业工会主席朱吉托继续担任农林工会国际主席，拒绝承认朱吉托的代表履行主席的职权。他们还阻挠锡兰种植园工人工会总书记桑穆加塔桑继续担任行政委员，排斥被印度反动派迫害的全印农民协会总书记赖耶尔普里继续担任农林工会国际副主席。苏联修正主义者这种假团结、真分裂，配合美帝国主义和反动派迫害进步力量的叛徒行径，引起了许多代表的不满和反对。印度尼西亚和锡兰的代表先后发表声明，愤怒谴责这种口头上尊重朱吉托、桑穆加塔桑，而实际上对他们进行排斥、打击的丑恶面目。中国代表团严正指出，这次会议在工会国际领导机构中排斥印尼、印度、锡兰等进步力量，是苏联领导集团勾结美帝国主义和各国反动派，镇压世界人民革命斗争的具体罪证。这种反革命行为必将受到历史的惩罚。
    中国代表团负责人指出，在这次会议上，苏联修正主义者竟然利用会议的总报告把中国神圣不可分割的领土——香港称作为一个“国家”。他们还利用造谣中伤、收买等无耻手段极力煽动与会代表反华。同时还采用关闭扩音器、起哄等反民主的手段，阻止中国代表团发言。
    中国代表团负责人说，绝大部分亚非拉代表坚决反对苏联修正主义者煽动反华，表示对中国友好。许多人赞扬和钦佩毛泽东思想和中国的立场。锡兰代表拉米亚在大会上高度评价了中国革命，他强调指出，“列宁开创了十月革命的道路，毛泽东同志领导的中国革命继续和发展了这条道路，这是全世界人民革命的道路。”一位非洲代表说，“毛泽东思想对亚非拉革命有着伟大的意义”，“中国的路线是完全正确的”。有些代表纷纷向中国代表团表示“支持中国的路线”，“赞赏中国的革命立场”。在会场内外，许多人主动向中国代表要毛主席像纪念章和《毛主席语录》。这一切都表明毛泽东思想正日益成为亚非拉人民和全世界人民的最强大、最尖锐的思想武器。
