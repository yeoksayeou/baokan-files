    Being a "nice guy" does not make one a true good person; a true good person should be bold and always care about the collective interests. Studying Chairman Mao's works has transformed me from a "nice guy" into someone who "involves himself in everything."

    Zhang Yunzhen

    In the past, I was the most famous "nice guy" in the village. How "nice" was I? For example, when meetings were held and I was asked to give suggestions, I always said I had none; when working in the fields, I never slacked off myself, but if others did not work hard, I did not care. When I saw things that harmed collective interests, I neither criticized nor reported them.

    Last year, our village began studying Chairman Mao's works. Everyone studied, and I followed along. Later, the more I listened, the more engrossed I became. When I heard "Opposing Liberalism," I could not sit still. Especially when Chairman Mao criticized some people for being "unconcerned when things do not affect them, speaking less when they know something is wrong, preserving themselves, and just seeking to avoid blame," I felt more and more ashamed, feeling that Chairman Mao was criticizing me. From then on, I loved listening to Chairman Mao's books even more. I listened every day, thought every day, and corrected myself every day. Slowly, this "nice guy" began to change.

    Once, a woman was digging pits for planting rice. She only cared about speed and not quality, digging pits that were small and shallow, and not fully preserving the topsoil. I thought, this way, it would affect grain production. So, I said to the woman, "Auntie, the pits you dug do not meet the standards and need to be repaired." This woman compared her work with others and also felt that her quality was poor, finally repairing the pits. My husband saw me managing this matter and said, "Why are you also getting involved in other people's business? Aren't you afraid of offending people?" I said confidently, "Revolutionary people should care about the collective's affairs. How can we not care when we see things that are not beneficial to the collective? For the collective, offending people is also worthwhile!"

    Now, whenever someone does something harmful to the collective, no matter who it is, I dare to criticize or struggle against it. The community members say I have changed, calling me "involved in everything." Many people wonder, "Who cured you of this 'disease' of not caring about anything? Who told you to do this?" I reply: It is Chairman Mao who told me to do this. I have studied Chairman Mao's works and realized that a "nice guy" is not a true good person. A true good person should be bold, always caring about collective interests, and thinking about the collective in everything.

    “老好人”变成“啥都管”
    张云珍
    我过去是村里顶顶有名的“老好人”。“老好”到什么程度？比方说，开会叫我提意见，我总是说没有；在地里干活，我自己从来不马虎，可是别人不好好干，我就不管。见到损害集体利益的事，我一不批评，二不汇报。
    去年，我们这个村开始学习毛主席著作。大家学，我也跟着听。后来，越听越入迷。听到《反对自由主义》的时候，我听着听着坐不住了。特别是听到毛主席批评有些人“事不关己，高高挂起；明知不对，少说为佳；明哲保身，但求无过。”我越听越惭愧，觉得毛主席就是批评我哩。从此，我更爱听毛主席的书了。天天听，天天想，天天改正，慢慢地我这“老好人”开始变了。
    有一次，一个妇女在掏坑田的时候，光顾速度快，不求质量好，掏的坑田又小又浅，表土也没全保住。我想，这样不就要影响增产粮食吗？于是，我对那个妇女说：“婶婶，你掏的坑田不合标准，需要修整修整。”这个妇女同别人掏的比较了一下，也感到自己掏的质量差，终于重新修整了。我管了这件事，被我男人看见了，他说：“你怎么也管起闲事来了，不怕惹人？”我理直气壮地说：“革命的人民就是要关心集体的事业。咱见了对集体不利的事怎能不管呢？为集体，惹人我也乐意！”
    现在，只要有人干不利于集体的事，不管是谁，我都敢于进行批评或斗争。社员说我变了，称我为“啥都管”。有不少人惊奇地问我：“是谁把你这个不管事的‘病’治好了？是谁叫你这样做的？”我回答说：是毛主席叫我这样做的。我学习了毛主席著作，认识到：“老好人”并不是真正的好人。一个真正的好人应该是“敢”字当头，时时刻刻关心集体利益，事事处处为集体着想。
