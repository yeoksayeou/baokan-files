The delegation from the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association is set to visit African and Arab countries.

The Asian-African Journalists Association, led by its General Secretary, Charoen, is holding a reception in Beijing tonight for the friendly delegation from the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association, which is about to visit African and Arab countries.

Charoen spoke at the reception. He said that at a time when the newly independent countries of Asia and Africa are playing an increasingly important role in their common struggle against imperialism led by the United States, the delegations led by Morrison and Sugiyama Shihei from the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association are about to visit African and Arab countries. This is of great significance.

Charoen condemned the recent armed aggression by the tool of U.S. imperialism, Israel, against the southern part of Jordanian Arab territory, and the concentration of troops on the Syrian border. He said that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association has always supported the just cause of the Arab people and the just cause of the African people. He mentioned that delegations sent by the Asian-African Journalists Association in the past to various Asian and African countries have strengthened the unity and ties between the Secretariat and member organizations, and promoted the unity of the people and journalists of Asia and Africa in their struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and to save their countries.

Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the China-Africa Friendship Association, toasted at the reception. The reception was filled with a warm atmosphere of fighting unity among Asian and African journalists.

Invited to the reception were Japanese peace activist Nishi Sonji, Sudanese peace activist Kail, Lao noblewoman Kuning Bounsena, and representatives of some international organizations in Beijing, as well as Asian and African journalists in Beijing.

Also present at the reception were Zhang Siyu, Chu Tunan, Wang Minzhao, Chang Zhiqing, Chen Weifan, and other relevant officials from our country.
