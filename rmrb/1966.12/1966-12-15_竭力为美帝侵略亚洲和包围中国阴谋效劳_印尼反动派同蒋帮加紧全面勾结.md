Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the right-wing military regime in Indonesia has further intensified its collaboration with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in political, military, and economic spheres, serving the U.S. imperialist plot to invade Asia and surround China.

According to a report by the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Chung Hwa News Agency," the right-wing military regime in Indonesia and the Chiang Kai-shek clique formally signed an agreement in New York on November 2 to process 75,000 bales of "U.S. aid" cotton yarn for the Indonesian right-wing authorities. On November 19, the regime openly dispatched its ambassador to Japan, Major General Rukminto Hendraningrat, and a delegation of four to Taiwan to discuss with the Chiang Kai-shek clique a loan plan worth hundreds of millions of dollars and a grain supply plan. The report said that the two sides have "reached a basic agreement" on these plans. It is revealed that more than a month ago, the right-wing military regime in Indonesia secretly sent a military delegation led by a colonel to Taiwan for a week of activities, meeting with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and the Chiang Kai-shek clique's personnel in charge of "economics and overseas affairs," requesting "cash loans" from the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The Chiang Kai-shek clique also sent 2,000 tons of rice as a "friendship gift" to the right-wing military regime in Indonesia. According to Agence France-Presse, the right-wing military regime in Indonesia and the Chiang Kai-shek clique are negotiating a "barter agreement."

In addition to economic collusion, the right-wing military regime in Indonesia is also in cahoots with the Chiang Kai-shek clique politically, aligning itself against the Chinese people. According to news from Jakarta, the right-wing military regime in Indonesia refers to the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who has been spurned by the Chinese people, as the "head of state of Taiwan," refers to the Chiang Kai-shek clique as the "government," and has maliciously slandered and attacked China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards.

According to news from Jakarta, the right-wing military regime in Indonesia also incites Chiang Kai-shek clique's spy elements in Indonesia to establish the "Jakarta Free Chinese Association for the Restoration of the Republic of China Industry Preparatory Committee" in Jakarta and the so-called "Chinese Charity Association" in Bandung, collaborating with the Indonesian right-wing authorities to carry out anti-China and anti-Chinese activities.

From the economic collusion of "purchasing" cotton cloth and processing "U.S. aid" cotton yarn, the right-wing military regime in Indonesia has developed into political and military collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, striving to serve the U.S. imperialist war policy.

Even the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "United Daily News" openly states that the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Indonesian right-wing military regime's surface-level "trade" has deeper implications, and the "connection" in "trade" is a "turning point in the enemy situation in Southeast Asia." It claims that the cooperation between the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Indonesian right-wing authorities is in accordance with the will of the United States, aiming to form a new crescent-shaped encirclement from the Sunda Strait to the Taiwan Strait against our country.

    竭力为美帝侵略亚洲和包围中国阴谋效劳
    印尼反动派同蒋帮加紧全面勾结
    据新华社十二日讯　在美帝国主义的指使下，印尼右派军人政权在政治、军事、经济方面进一步同蒋帮加紧勾结，为美帝国主义侵略亚洲和包围中国的阴谋效劳。
    据蒋帮《征信新闻报》报道，印尼右派军人政权同蒋帮十一月二日在美国纽约正式签订了一项为印尼右派当局加工“美援”棉纱七万五千包的“协定”，十一月十九日，又公然指使印尼右派军人政权驻日本的大使鲁克明托·亨德拉宁格拉特少将一行四人到台湾活动，同蒋帮“商讨”一项价值数百万美元的“贷款计划”和一项有关“粮食供应计划”。报道说，这两项计划，双方“原则上已达成协议”。据透露，在一个多月前，印尼右派军人政权曾秘密派遣一个由一名上校率领的军方代表团，到台湾活动了一周，与卖国贼蒋介石和蒋帮“经济及侨务”方面的人员进行了接触，向蒋帮要求“现金贷款”。蒋帮还把二千吨食米作为“友谊”赠品送给印尼右派军人政权。据法新社透露，印尼右派军人政权同蒋帮正在谈判签订一项“以货易货的协定”。
    印尼右派军人政权在经济上同蒋帮勾勾搭搭，在政治上是狼狈为奸，与中国人民为敌。据雅加达消息透露，印尼右派军人政权把早被中国人民唾弃了的卖国贼蒋介石称为“台湾国家元首”，称蒋帮为“政府”，并对我国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵的革命行动进行了恶毒的诬蔑和攻击。
    据雅加达消息透露，印尼右派军人政权还怂恿在印尼的蒋帮特务分子，在雅加达成立了“雅加达自由华侨恢复中华总会属下产业筹备会”和在万隆成立了所谓“华侨慈善会”，协同印尼右派当局搞反华排华活动。
    印尼右派军人政权同蒋帮从“购买”棉布，加工“美援”棉纱的经济勾结开始，进而发展到了政治、军事的勾结，竭力为美帝国主义的战争政策效劳。
    连蒋帮《联合报》也毫不隐讳地说，蒋帮和印尼右派军人政权表面上是“贸易”，但深一层，“很有启示意义”，“贸易”上的“联系”，是“扭转东南亚敌我形势的契机”。并声称蒋帮同印尼右派当局的“合作”，是秉承美国的意志，使“自巽他海峡到台湾海峡”真正对我国形成一个新月形的包围圈。
