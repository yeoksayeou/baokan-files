Leaders of the China-Japan Friendship Association, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation today issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters, firmly supporting the protest by the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival Participating Organizations Liaison Meeting and the Japanese Socialist Party against the Sato government's sabotage of the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The China-Japan Friendship Association, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation firmly support the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival Participating Organizations Liaison Meeting and the Japanese Socialist Party in their protest against the Sato government's obstinate opposition to the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and its sabotage of the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. We express our utmost indignation and strong protest against the Sato government's evil deeds.

The Sato government's obstruction of Japanese youth coming to China and its sabotage of the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival is another anti-China plot it has hatched in collusion with U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their various new and old followers. The Sato government's evil deeds fully expose its hostile attitude towards the Chinese people and its role as a spearhead in anti-China activities; at the same time, this incident also exposes the ugly faces of a small clique of people who, under the guise of Sino-Japanese friendship, engage in anti-China activities.

The reason why U.S. imperialism, the Sato government of Japan, Soviet modern revisionism, and their various new and old followers are doing everything in their power to obstruct and sabotage the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival is that they are extremely afraid of the strengthening of the fighting friendship and revolutionary unity between the peoples and youth of China and Japan. They are extremely afraid of the profound influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China on Japan and the world. They are extremely afraid of the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people, especially the Red Guards who are the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are extremely afraid of the great achievements of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. In a word, they are extremely afraid of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the high prestige that Chairman Mao enjoys among the Japanese people and the revolutionary people of the world. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in our time, the most powerful ideological weapon for defeating imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth that applies everywhere. Truth is invincible. Mao Zedong Thought is being grasped by more and more revolutionary people around the world and is radiating boundless brilliance.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Apart from the monopoly capitalists and militarist clique who are pro-American, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." "It is U.S. imperialism that has forced the peoples of China and Japan to unite. Both our peoples are suffering from the oppression of U.S. imperialism, and we have common experiences, so we have united." Strengthening and developing the fighting friendship and revolutionary unity between the peoples of China and Japan in their common struggle against U.S. imperialism, and persistently holding the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival, the peoples of China and Japan will be friends for generations to come. This is not only the common wish and fundamental interest of the peoples of China and Japan, but also the requirement of the times. This is an irresistible historical trend that no reactionary forces can stop.

Chinese youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought are people of their word. We Chinese youth will, as always, resolutely fight to strengthen the fighting friendship between the youth of China and Japan and to ensure the success of the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. The Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival will definitely be held and will definitely succeed. We revolutionary youth and Red Guards in China have made all the preparations. Whenever our Japanese friends come, we will welcome them.

We are firmly convinced that the excellent sons and daughters of the great Japanese nation, as long as they make up their minds, strengthen their unity, and persist in their struggle, will definitely be able to break through all obstacles and win the final victory.

Japanese youth hold a protest rally, vowing to fight against all domestic and foreign forces that sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship and to fight for further promoting exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan and cultural and economic exchanges.

    中日友协等负责人抗议佐藤政府破坏中日青年大联欢
    佐藤政府害怕中日人民友谊，甘当反华急先锋
    日本青年坚持斗争就一定能赢得最后胜利
    新华社二十一日讯中国日本友好协会、中华全国青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会负责人，今天对新华社记者发表谈话，坚决支持日本第二届日中青年友好大联欢参加团体联络会议和日本社会党对佐藤政府破坏第二届中日青年友好大联欢的抗议。谈话全文如下：
    中国日本友好协会、中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会坚决支持日本第二届日中青年友好大联欢参加团体联络会议和日本社会党抗议佐藤政府顽固地与中日人民为敌，破坏中日青年友好大联欢的暴行，并对佐藤政府的罪恶行径表示极大愤慨和强烈的抗议。
    日本佐藤政府阻挠日本青年来华，破坏中日青年友好大联欢，是它同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的新旧追随者串通一气，干下的又一反华勾当。佐藤政府这种罪恶行径，充分暴露了它敌视中国人民、充当反华急先锋的狰狞面目；同时，从这件事情中也暴露了一小撮披着中日友好外衣、干着反华勾当的人的丑恶嘴脸。
    美帝国主义、日本佐藤政府、苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的新旧追随者之所以千方百计地阻挠和破坏第二届中日青年友好大联欢，就是因为他们十分害怕中日两国人民和青年加强战斗友谊和革命团结，十分害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命在日本和全世界发生的深远影响，十分害怕中国人民，特别是无产阶级文化大革命的闯将红卫兵的革命造反精神，十分害怕中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就。一句话，他们十分害怕战无不胜的毛泽东思想，十分害怕毛主席在日本人民和世界革命人民中享有的崇高威望。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的最强大的思想武器。毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。真理是任何力量也阻挡不了的。毛泽东思想正为世界上越来越多的革命人民所掌握，放射出无比灿烂的光辉。
    毛主席教导我们：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”“是美帝国主义迫使我们中日两国人民联合起来的。我们两国人民都遭受美帝国主义的压迫，我们有着共同的遭遇，就团结起来了。”加强和发展中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中结成的战斗友谊和革命团结，坚持中日两国青年友好大联欢，中日两国人民要世世代代友好下去，这不仅是中日两国人民的共同愿望和根本利益，也是时代对我们的要求，这是任何反动势力也阻挡不了的历史洪流。
    以毛泽东思想武装起来的中国青年说话是算数的。我们中国青年将一如既往，坚决为加强中日两国青年的战斗友谊，为实现第二届中日青年友好大联欢的胜利举行而斗争。第二届中日青年友好大联欢一定要举行、一定要实现。我们中国广大革命青年和红卫兵已经作好了一切准备，日本青年朋友什么时候来，我们就什么时候欢迎。
    我们坚信：伟大的日本民族的优秀儿女，只要下定决心，加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够冲破重重障碍，赢得最后胜利。（附图片）
