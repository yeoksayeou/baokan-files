    Chairman Mao has pointed out, "The governments of Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Franco, and Chiang Kai-shek have abolished or simply not used the veil of bourgeois democracy, because the class struggle within the country has reached a tense extreme, and it is more advantageous to abolish or simply not use that veil, so that the people do not also use that veil to dance wildly." The Indian reactionaries, frightened by the Indian people's struggle against tyranny, are now openly following in the footsteps of Hitler and his ilk.

    The Indian government has always used the banner of "freedom" and "democracy" to carry out the brutal rule of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie over the Indian people. In the face of the increasingly sharp class struggle and the surging people's struggle within India, the Indian government has thrown that bit of bourgeois "freedom" and "democracy" to the winds, and brazenly taken the fascist path. It savagely massacres and persecutes unarmed crowds, extends the so-called "Preventive Detention Act," establishes "deputy principals" in schools to engage in espionage work, sets up "industrial security forces" in industrial areas to suppress workers, and establishes "village volunteer corps" in rural areas to suppress peasants. It also wants to maintain a "state of emergency" within the country. In a word, it wants to use fascist methods more extensively throughout India to suppress the struggle of the Indian people.

    However, where there is oppression, there is resistance. The more oppression, the stronger the resistance. Fascist rule did not save Hitler and his ilk from destruction, and it will not prolong the life of the Indian reactionaries. On the contrary, the Indian people will certainly become more resolute in their struggle against the fascist rule of the Congress Party government. They will more bravely fight for their liberation.

### 压迫越大，反抗越强

    压迫越大，反抗越强
    毛主席曾经指出，“希特勒、墨索里尼、东条、佛郎哥、蒋介石等人的政府取消了或者索性不用那片资产阶级内部民主的幕布，是因为国内阶级斗争紧张到了极点，取消或者索性不用那片布比较地有利些，免得人民也利用那片布去手舞足蹈。”被印度人民的反暴政斗争吓破了胆的印度反动派，现在也公开继承了希特勒之流的衣钵。
    印度政府一向打着“自由”、“民主”的招牌，对印度人民实行大地主大资产阶级的残暴专政。在印度国内阶级斗争日益尖锐、人民斗争风起云涌的情况下，印度政府就把那一点儿资产阶级的“自由”“民主”抛到了九霄云外，赤裸裸地走上了法西斯的道路。它野蛮地屠杀、迫害手无寸铁的群众，延长所谓“预防拘留法”，在学校里设立专搞特务工作的“副校长”，在工业区搞镇压工人的“产业保安部队”，在农村搞镇压农民的“乡村志愿队”，还要在国内保持“紧急状态”。一句话，它想在印度全国变本加厉地使用法西斯的手段，把印度人民的斗争镇压下去。
    但是，有压迫，就有反抗。压迫越大，反抗越强。法西斯统治没有能够挽救希特勒之流的灭亡，也决延长不了印度反动派的寿命。相反，印度人民一定会在同国大党政府的法西斯统治的斗争中锻炼得更坚强。他们将更勇敢地去争取自己的解放。
