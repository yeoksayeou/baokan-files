Comrades:

The conference has learned that on December 14, the Chinese Embassy in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was brutally bombed by American aggressor planes, and we unanimously express our utmost indignation. In the name of the people of all circles in the capital, we extend to you our warmest condolences.

During this bombing by American planes, you were fearless and unyielding, steadfastly standing at your posts. This fully demonstrates that in any situation, you dare to struggle and dare to win, and are staunch fighters against imperialism. At the same time, this powerfully shows that the U.S. imperialists' attempt to shake the resolve of the Chinese people to aid Vietnam and resist America through the threat of war is absolutely futile.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have already won revolutionary victories should support the struggle of the people who are still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have always firmly supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. Your actions embody the internationalist spirit of the Chinese people. The struggle of the Vietnamese people is our struggle. The victory of the Vietnamese people is our victory. We believe that you will surely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Be good soldiers of Chairman Mao and make greater contributions to the common struggle and victory of the peoples of China and Vietnam against U.S. imperialism.

    给我国驻越南大使馆全体同志慰问电同志们：
    大会获悉十二月十四日我国驻越南民主共和国大使馆遭到美国强盗飞机的野蛮轰炸，一致表示极大的愤慨。我们以首都各界人民的名义，向你们致以最亲切的慰问。
    在这次美机轰炸我国大使馆的时候，你们无所畏惧，不怕牺牲，坚守工作岗位。这充分表明，在任何情况下，你们敢于斗争、敢于胜利，是反对帝国主义的坚强战士。同时，这也有力地表明，美帝国主义想用战争的威胁来动摇中国人民援越抗美的决心，这是绝对办不到的。
    毛主席教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，一贯坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。你们的行动体现了我国人民的国际主义精神。越南人民的斗争，就是我们的斗争。越南人民的胜利，就是我们的胜利。我们相信，你们一定能够更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，为中越两国人民反对美帝国主义的共同斗争和胜利作出更大的贡献。
