Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam wrote a letter to the American people on December 24, strongly condemning the U.S. government's escalation of the war in Vietnam and expressing the determination of the South Vietnamese people to fight to the end, regardless of sacrifices.

The letter states that while the South Vietnamese people are engaged in fierce battles against the Johnson administration's policy of aggression and enslavement, they remain attentive to the various struggles of the American people and rejoice in their victories.

In the letter, Nguyen Huu Tho, on behalf of the South Vietnamese people, expresses heartfelt thanks to the American people for their courageous condemnation and opposition to the U.S. government's dirty war in Vietnam.

Nguyen Huu Tho states in the letter that the American people's attitude of opposing the White House's policy of aggression and war, and actively supporting the legitimate aspirations of the South Vietnamese people, has already received and continues to receive the welcome and strong support of people around the world.

The letter emphasizes that while the U.S. government talks about "peace intentions," in reality, it is strengthening and expanding the war. The Johnson administration is frantically sending more troops and weapons to South Vietnam, savagely bombing and strafing the capital city of Hanoi in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and at the same time, proposing conditions that attempt to force the South Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and surrender.

The letter states that in the face of the Johnson administration's refusal to abandon its secret plot to permanently occupy South Vietnam and divide the country, the South Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, are determined to endure any sacrifices and hardships, and to fight resolutely to seize their sacred national rights.

The letter expresses the belief that the American people will further unite and wage more intense struggles, demanding that the U.S. government stop the war of aggression in South Vietnam, withdraw all American troops, and allow the Vietnamese people to determine their own fate.

In conclusion, Nguyen Huu Tho stresses that the just struggles of the Vietnamese and American peoples will surely triumph, and he wishes for the friendship between the South Vietnamese people and the American people to continue to develop!

    信中说，越南南方人民在进行反对约翰逊政府的侵略和奴役政策的激烈战斗的同时，仍然关注着美国人民所进行的各种斗争，并且对美国人民在斗争中取得的胜利感到无比高兴。
    阮友寿在信中代表越南南方人民，对美国人民勇敢地谴责和反对美国政府对越南进行的肮脏战争，表示衷心的感谢。

    信中说，面对约翰逊政府不肯放弃霸占越南南方和永远分割我国的不可告人的阴谋，越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，决心不怕任何牺牲和艰苦，坚决战斗，以夺取自己的神圣的民族权利。
    信中表示相信，美国人民将进一步团结起来，进行更猛烈的斗争，要求美国政府停止侵略越南南方的战争，把美国军队全部撤回国，让越南人民自己决定自己的命运。
    阮友寿在信中最后强调，越南人民和美国人民的正义斗争必胜，他并祝越南南方人民和美国人民之间的友谊日益良好地发展！
