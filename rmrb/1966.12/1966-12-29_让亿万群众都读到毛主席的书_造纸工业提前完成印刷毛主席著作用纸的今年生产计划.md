The revolutionary workers of China's paper industry, filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and boundless admiration for the great Mao Zedong Thought, have actively produced offset paper for printing Chairman Mao's works and achieved outstanding results. The production plan for offset paper this year has been completed 80 days ahead of schedule, with a 56% increase in production over last year, significantly improved quality, and reduced costs.

Since the Central Committee of the Party decided to accelerate the large-scale publication and distribution of Chairman Mao's works, workers in paper enterprises across the country have been jubilant and have expressed their determination to do their utmost to produce more and better paper, contributing to the large-scale publication and distribution of Chairman Mao's works. They say: Producing paper for printing Chairman Mao's works is like producing spiritual atomic bombs. The more the class enemies try to obstruct the printing and distribution of Chairman Mao's works and prevent the workers, peasants, and soldiers from mastering Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must produce large quantities of paper for printing Chairman Mao's works, allowing hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers to master Mao Zedong Thought, and letting the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought shine across the globe.

Workers in paper enterprises across the country, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have vigorously carried out technological innovations and technological revolutions, exploring every possible way to fully utilize existing equipment and complete the glorious tasks assigned by the Party. In the past, producing offset paper with double-circular wire and single-drying cylinder paper machines did not meet quality standards and usage requirements. Workers at the Weifang Paper Mill in Shandong and the Baichengzi Paper Mill in Jilin demonstrated their revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act, creating a semi-wet pressure polishing machine installed on double-circular wire drying cylinder paper machines, making the product quality reach the standard and meet usage requirements, thus pioneering the production of offset paper on double-circular wire drying cylinder paper machines. Workers in the pulp-making workshop of the Jincheng Paper Mill in Liaoning, guided by Chairman Mao's teaching that "Human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress," broke through old and foreign frameworks, continuously practiced, and summarized, successively reforming dust removal, washing, and other equipment, not only saving manpower but also improving the quantity and quality of pulp. The paper-making workshops of Guangdong People's Paper Mill, Shunde Sugar Mill, and Sichuan Neijiang Sugar Mill successfully produced offset paper using sugarcane residue as raw material, opening up a new source of raw materials for producing paper for Chairman Mao's works.

Workers in paper enterprises across the country have taken a high sense of political responsibility towards product quality. This year, the offset paper produced nationwide for Chairman Mao's works has made new achievements in reducing dust content, improving smoothness, and solving problems such as paper transparency and shedding.

Currently, revolutionary workers in paper enterprises across the country are deeply carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They are determined to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles," carry out a revolution in their souls, accelerate the revolutionization of their thinking, and continue to produce more and better paper for Chairman Mao's works for the country.

    让亿万群众都读到毛主席的书
    造纸工业提前完成印刷毛主席著作用纸的今年生产计划
    据新华社二十八日讯我国造纸工业战线广大革命职工，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对伟大的毛泽东思想无限崇拜的深厚感情，积极生产印刷毛主席著作的凸版纸，取得了优异的成绩。今年凸版纸的生产计划，已经提前八十天全面完成，产量比去年增长百分之五十六，质量显著提高，成本有所降低。
    自从党中央作出加速大量出版和发行毛主席著作的决定以后，各地造纸企业广大职工欢欣鼓舞，纷纷表示一定要尽最大努力，多产纸、产好纸，为大量出版和发行毛主席著作作出贡献。他们说：生产毛主席著作用纸印刷毛主席著作，就是生产精神原子弹。阶级敌人越是阻挠印刷发行毛主席著作，不让我们工农兵群众掌握毛泽东思想，我们就越要大量生产毛主席著作用纸印刷毛主席著作，让亿万工农兵群众掌握毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照红全球。
    各地造纸企业职工以毛泽东思想为武器，大力开展技术革新和技术革命，千方百计挖掘现有设备能力，完成党交给的光荣任务。过去用双圆网双烘缸、单烘缸纸机生产凸版纸，质量达不到标准，不符合使用要求，山东潍坊纸厂和吉林白城子纸厂工人发扬敢想、敢干的革命精神，创造了半湿压光机，安装在双圆网烘缸纸机上，使产品质量达到了标准，满足了使用要求，从而开创了在双圆网双烘缸纸机上生产凸版纸的先例。辽宁金城纸厂制浆车间工人根据毛主席的“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，打破了旧框框、洋框框，不断实践，不断总结，先后改革了除尘、洗涤等设备，不仅节省人力，而且提高了浆料的数量和质量。广东省人民纸厂、顺德糖厂和四川内江糖厂的造纸车间，以甘蔗渣为原料试制凸版纸成功，为生产毛主席著作用纸开辟了新的原料来源。
    各地造纸企业职工以高度的政治责任心来对待产品质量。今年全国生产的毛主席著作用纸，在降低尘埃度，提高平滑度，以及解决纸张透印和掉毛掉粉毛病等方面，都取得了新成绩。
    目前，全国各地造纸企业广大职工正在深入地开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，他们决心学好“老三篇”，在灵魂深处闹革命，加速思想革命化，继续为国家增产更多更好的毛主席著作用纸。
