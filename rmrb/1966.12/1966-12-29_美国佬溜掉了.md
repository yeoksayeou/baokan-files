The Chinese folk dance troupe performed in Cairo and was warmly welcomed by the people of the United Arab Republic, causing a sensation throughout the city. This made the Americans in Cairo quite uneasy. With ulterior motives, they sneaked into the theater, looking for an opportunity to cause trouble. However, when the American soldiers on stage raised the white flag and surrendered to the Vietnamese heroine, the cheers and applause from the audience made the Americans sitting there feel like they were on pins and needles, as if they were being publicly tried, and they hung their heads. Some Americans couldn't bear to stay any longer and slipped away midway.

    中国民间歌舞团在开罗演出，受到阿联人民热烈欢迎，轰动了整个开罗，这使在开罗的美国佬十分不安。他们怀着鬼胎钻到剧场去，想找机会捣乱。可是，当舞台上的美国兵举起白旗向南越女英雄投降时，台下观众喝采声、欢呼声使坐在那里的美国佬如坐针毡，活像受公审似地搭下了脑袋。有的美国佬不敢久呆，中途偷偷地溜掉了。
