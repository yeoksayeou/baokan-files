The U.S. imperialists' "bomb to force peace" plot has been exposed. In a hurry, they want U Thant to promote a new deception of peace talks. A Soviet deputy foreign minister, after several secret talks with U Thant in New York, has returned to his country.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 20th, Washington: The Johnson administration, after continuously sending planes to bomb Hanoi and further "escalating" the war in Vietnam, on the 19th, once again brought out the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant to help the United States concoct a new "peace talk" deception.

The U.S. representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, met with U Thant on the 19th and handed him a letter, requesting that U Thant take "any steps he deems necessary to promote the discussions required for such a ceasefire as called for by the Pope." The letter stated that the U.S. government would "cooperate fully" with U Thant in this regard.

Thus, the U.S. imperialists have once again exposed their shameful plot to play the new "bomb to force peace" trick.

Goldberg's letter, ignoring the fact that the Johnson administration is continuously expanding the war in Vietnam and is planning to further escalate this aggression, shamelessly talks about the U.S.'s "hope for a peaceful resolution of the Vietnam conflict," while at the same time bringing up the stinking "14-point plan" for a peaceful resolution of the Vietnam issue proposed by the U.S. a year ago, advocating for a meeting to "discuss" the issue of "stopping hostile actions."

According to reports, this action was personally decided by Johnson after consulting with Goldberg and the recently returned "vacationing" U.S. ambassador to Saigon, Lodge. Goldberg requested that U Thant distribute this letter as an "official document" of the United Nations Security Council.

It is worth noting that U Thant, who has repeatedly acted as a go-between for the U.S. and the Soviet Union and served the U.S.'s "peace talk" deception, immediately stated that he would "carefully study" the U.S.'s request and then promptly met with the Soviet chief representative to the United Nations, Fedorenko, to "consult" on this matter. Afterwards, Fedorenko refused to disclose the contents of the meeting.

At the same time, there are reports that the Soviet deputy foreign minister Kuznetsov, who suddenly arrived in New York in mid-November, has recently left quietly. A report from Agence France-Presse on the 19th from the United Nations said: "Considering the timing of his return, it is believed here that he may have some connection with the U.S.'s request for U Thant to take action on the Vietnam issue; the fact that U Thant immediately conveyed the contents of the U.S.'s request to the Soviet representative Fedorenko also seems to support this possibility." During his stay in New York, Kuznetsov had several secret talks with U Thant, and it is revealed that they focused on discussing the Vietnam issue. There are also reports that he had secretly "visited" Washington.

According to a report by the U.S. official propaganda agency United Press on the 19th, U.S. officials claimed: "The U.S. is making many channels busy with an effort to move the Vietnam war to the negotiating table." On the same day, the Associated Press also made a similar report, revealing that Goldberg handing the letter to U Thant was just "one of the many actions" the U.S. is taking in plotting a new "peace talk" deception.

In reporting Goldberg's letter, United Press tried to cover up the fact that U.S. officials did not want to call this action "the beginning of another U.S. peace offensive"; however, reports from other Western news agencies pointed out that "this U.S. initiative came almost immediately after the bombing of Hanoi and its suburbs," and believed that it was "Johnson's Christmas trick."

### 美帝“以炸迫和”阴谋不打自招  急急忙忙又要吴丹出面推销和谈新骗局  苏副外长在纽约同吴丹数次密谈后回国

    美帝“以炸迫和”阴谋不打自招
    急急忙忙又要吴丹出面推销和谈新骗局
    苏副外长在纽约同吴丹数次密谈后回国
    据新华社二十日讯　华盛顿消息：美国约翰逊政府在连续派遣飞机轰炸河内、把侵越战争进一步“升级”之后，十九日，再一次把联合国秘书长吴丹请出来帮助美国搞新的“和谈”骗局。
    美国驻联合国代表戈德堡十九日会见吴丹，交给他一封信件，要求吴丹采取他“认为是必要的任何步骤，以促成（罗马教皇所呼吁的）那样一种停火所必须进行的讨论。”信中说，美国政府将在这方面同吴丹“进行充分的合作。”
    这样，美帝国主义就再一次不打自招地供认了它正在无耻地玩弄新的“以炸迫和”的阴谋。
    戈德堡的信件不顾约翰逊政府不断扩大侵越战争，并且正在策划进一步扩大这场侵略战争的事实，厚颜无耻地大谈美国“希望和平解决越南冲突的愿望”，同时又搬出了美国在一年前提出的那个臭气熏人的所谓和平解决越南问题的“十四点计划”，鼓吹开会“讨论”“停止敌对行动”问题。
    据报道，这个行动，是约翰逊在同戈德堡以及刚刚回国“休假”的美国驻西贡“大使”洛奇磋商之后亲自决定的。戈德堡要求吴丹把这封信作为联合国安全理事会的“正式文件”散发。
    值得注意的是，曾经多次在美苏之间穿针引线、为美国的“和谈”骗局效劳的吴丹，立刻表示他将“仔细研究”美国的要求，并且随即约见了苏联驻联合国首席代表费德林，同他就这个问题“进行了磋商”。事后，费德林拒绝透露会谈内容。
    同时，有消息说，十一月中旬突然到纽约活动的苏联副外长库兹涅佐夫，已在最近悄然离开。法新社十九日从联合国发出的报道说：“考虑到回国的时机，此间认为，他可能同美国要求吴丹在越南问题上采取行动一事有某种关系；吴丹把美国提出的要求的内容立即转告苏联代表费德林这一事实，似乎也支持了这种可能性。”库兹涅佐夫在纽约期间曾几度同吴丹密谈，据透露，他们着重讨论了越南问题。还有消息说，他曾秘密“访问”了华盛顿。
    据美国官方宣传机构美新处十九日报道，美国官员声称：“美国正使许多渠道忙于进行一项使越南战争移向会议桌的努力”。同一天，美联社也作了同样的报道，并且透露，戈德堡向吴丹递交信件只是美国在策划新的“和谈”骗局方面所作的“许多努力当中的一个行动”。
    美新处在报道戈德堡的信件时掩饰说，美国官员不肯把这一行动说成是“美国另一次和平攻势的开始”；但是，其他西方通讯社的报道指出，“美国的这个倡议几乎是紧接着轰炸河内及其郊区之后提出的”，并且认为，这是“约翰逊的圣诞节花招”。
