	Quotation boards featuring Chairman Mao's sayings are like revolutionary mirrors and guides to action.
	This is the common sentiment among the members of the Ruitian Production Brigade in the Linghou Production Team of the Haiyang People's Commune in Longhai County, Liaoning Province.

	To guide their actions with Chairman Mao's words, the members of this production brigade started setting up more than forty quotation boards last autumn. These boards are hung in streets and in the homes of the commune members. By November of this year, each board had been rewritten more than a hundred times. To ensure that the quotation boards are lively and effective, they established four study groups to guide the writing, reciting, and explaining of Chairman Mao's quotations. Initially, the content of the quotations was decided by the instructors, which lacked relevance and could not be updated in a timely manner. Later, they learned from the experience of the People's Liberation Army in collectively selecting quotations and adopted a method where everyone participated in selecting the quotations. This way, the quotation boards became increasingly effective.

	After setting up the quotation boards, they began to address issues in the three great revolutionary movements by studying and applying Chairman Mao's teachings in their actual situations. Their experience is to follow the trends, align with the Party's central tasks, and target the thoughts of the commune members with precision.

	This spring, the production brigade undertook the task of digging a large number of high-yield pits, which was a heavy burden. Some members initially had a sense of difficulty. After discussions, the quotation board displayed Chairman Mao's teaching: "Resolutely to carry out the task, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." This guidance inspired everyone to strive for progress and overcome difficulties. In just one month, they dug more than five hundred high-yield pits, completing the task on time and in quality, providing favorable conditions for this year's agricultural harvest.

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all the quotation boards in the brigade displayed Chairman Mao's teaching: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, and all monsters and demons must be criticized and cannot be allowed to spread freely." This greatly raised the political consciousness of the masses, inspired revolutionary enthusiasm, and the commune members actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Since setting up the quotation boards, not only the young people but also the elderly and children in Ruitian Production Brigade have been studying them. Grandma Zhang Guirong, who cannot write, has her grandson write Chairman Mao's quotations on the board and reads them to her. Commune member Lin Jinying not only recites the quotations at home but also while working in the fields. She can now recite more than twenty passages from Chairman Mao's works, including "Moving Mountains," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "Serve the People." The commune members say: "Memorizing Chairman Mao's words, we fear no difficulties; memorizing Chairman Mao's words, we speak with reason and act with clarity; memorizing Chairman Mao's words, we help others with reason and keep our minds clear."

### 语录板处处挂毛主席说啥咱干啥

    语录板处处挂毛主席说啥咱干啥
    “毛主席语录板是一面革命的镜子，是行动的指南。”
    这是辽宁省长海县海洋公社岭后大队瑞城屯生产队社员的共同语言。
    这个生产队的社员为了用毛主席的话指导自己的行动，从去年秋天开始，就办起了毛主席语录板四十多块。这些语录板分别挂在街头和社员家里。到今年十一月份，每块语录板都换写了一百多次。为了把毛主席语录板办活办好，他们成立了四个学习《毛主席语录》辅导小组，负责写语录、念语录、讲语录。开头，写什么语录都由辅导员决定，结果写的语录缺乏针对性，还不能及时换写。后来，他们学习了解放军集体选语录的经验，采取了大家选语录的办法。这样，语录板就越办越好。
    毛主席语录板办起来以后，他们便带着三大革命运动中的问题，联系实际，边学边用。他们的经验是：紧跟形势，紧跟党的中心工作，针对社员的思想实际，有的放矢地发动大家选语录。
    今年春天，生产队大挖丰产坑，任务很重，有些社员起初有畏难情绪。经过大家讨论，语录板上写出“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的这一教导，激发了大家奋发图强、不怕困难的革命精神。仅在一个月的时间里，大家就一鼓作气挖了五百多个丰产坑，按质按量地完成任务，为今年的农业丰收提供了有利条件。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，全队的语录板都写上了毛主席的教导：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”这样，就大大提高了群众的思想觉悟，鼓舞了群众的革命热情，社员们积极参加了无产阶级文化大革命。
    瑞城屯生产队自从办起语录板以后，不仅青年人学，老年人也学，少年儿童也学。张桂英老大娘，自己不会写字，就叫孙子把毛主席语录写在语录板上，念给她听。社员林金英，不仅在家背语录，下地干活也背语录。她现在已能背诵毛主席的《愚公移山》《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》和其他著作中的二十几段语录。社员们说：“记下毛主席的话，什么困难也不怕；记下毛主席的话，说话有根做事有准；记下毛主席的话，帮人有理，自己心明眼亮。”
