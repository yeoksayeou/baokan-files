The broad masses of community members in Fuan Special District, Fujian Province, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. After several months of tenacious efforts, they have achieved a significant victory in the autumn anti-disaster struggle. Now, the late rice in this district has been harvested and threshed. In many coastal areas that suffered heavy damage, the production of most communities has not decreased or has only slightly decreased; in the mountainous areas of various counties that suffered lighter damage, the production of late rice has increased significantly. Seeing such a good harvest in a year of major disasters, the community members all say this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

In early September this year, just as the late rice was in a critical growth period, this district was hit by a series of typhoons, tidal waves, and mountain floods. In the entire district, nine counties had 730,000 mu of autumn grain crops submerged, and some sea dikes and water conservancy projects were destroyed. Faced with such a serious disaster, the cadres and community members throughout the district remained undaunted. They studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, and launched a courageous struggle against the disaster, ultimately achieving victory.

    用毛泽东思想武装社员头脑
    福安专区夺得抗灾斗争大胜利
    福建省福安专区广大社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，经过几个月的顽强努力，夺得了秋季抗灾斗争的重大胜利。现在，这个专区的晚稻已经收割登场，沿海地区许多受灾较重的社队，一般都没有减产或减产不多；受灾较轻的山区各县的晚稻都获得大幅度增产。社员们看到大灾之年有这样好的年景，都说这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    今年九月初，正当晚稻生长的关键时刻，这个专区连续遭到台风、海啸和山洪的袭击，全区九个县有七十三万亩秋粮作物被淹，还有一部分海堤和水利工程被毁坏。在这样严重的灾害面前，全区干部社员毫不气馁，他们活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，向灾害展开了英勇的斗争，取得了胜利。
