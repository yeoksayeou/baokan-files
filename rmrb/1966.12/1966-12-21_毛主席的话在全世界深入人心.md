Today, revolutionary people all over the world yearn for Mao Zedong Thought. In our work of receiving passengers, we increasingly see friends from various countries eagerly studying Chairman Mao's works. Many foreign friends excitedly express to us: "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people, but also the great leader of the revolutionary people of the whole world. Chairman Mao's words have strengthened our confidence in the victory of the revolutionary cause. We love to read the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' the most." Such heartfelt words of praise express the boundless respect and deep love that the revolutionary people of the world have for Chairman Mao.

When we are flying in the air, or before takeoff and after landing, as long as we say to the passengers, "Let's study the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' together, shall we?" the foreign guests immediately respond with enthusiastic applause, shouting, "Good, good, welcome!" Then, in the cabin, in the waiting room, the sound of reciting Chairman Mao's quotations in various languages fills the air. Once, a West German passenger recorded this scene full of revolutionary sentiment with a tape recorder. He said he wanted to take it back as a keepsake.

Some foreign friends' diligent spirit in studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" deeply moves us. Once, a Swedish friend flew from Beijing to Guangzhou. During the four-hour flight, the flight attendant offered him tea and candy, but he didn't even bother to respond, just focused on reading the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Such touching incidents, we have encountered many times in our work.

Foreign friends are so eager to study the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" because Chairman Mao's words represent the interests of the revolutionary people of the world, pointing out the direction for the world's revolutionary people to advance, and are the strongest ideological weapon in the world people's revolutionary struggle. Once, two foreign friends boarded the plane and immediately took out Chairman Mao's works to study Chairman Mao's theory on armed struggle with full concentration. They told the flight attendant: Chairman Mao said, "Every Communist must grasp this truth: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'" We are now going to Jinggangshan to learn from it. Many guests from the anti-American struggle fronts in Vietnam, Laos, and other countries often ask us to teach them to read the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" word by word in Chinese. They said that from Chairman Mao's words, they draw endless strength for their struggle.

Comrade Lin Biao said: Chairman Mao's words are the highest in level, the highest in prestige, the greatest in power, every sentence is the truth, one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences. The situation of foreign friends studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with high revolutionary enthusiasm proves that Chairman Mao's words are increasingly penetrating deep into the hearts of people around the world. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the course of world revolution, showing the world's people their bright future.

    毛主席的话在全世界深入人心
    今天，全世界的革命人民都向往着毛泽东思想。我们在接待旅客时，也越来越多地见到来自世界各国的朋友如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。许多外国朋友激动地向我们表示：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖。毛主席的话，增强了我们对革命事业必胜的信心。《毛主席语录》我们最爱读”。这种充满着真挚的革命感情的赞语，表达了全世界革命人民对毛主席的无限崇敬、无比热爱的心情。
    当我们在空中飞行的时候，或是在起飞前和到达后，只要我们向旅客们说：“让我们一起学习《毛主席语录》好吗？”外宾们马上热烈鼓掌响应，大声地说：“好，好，欢迎！”于是，在机舱里，在候机室里，响起了一片用各国语言朗读毛主席语录的声音。有一次，一位西德旅客把这片充满革命感情的朗诵声用录音机录了下来。他说，要带回去留作纪念。
    有些外国朋友学习毛主席语录的刻苦精神，使我们十分感动。有一次有位瑞典朋友从北京乘飞机到广州。在四个小时的航程中，乘务员同志给他送茶送糖，他都顾不上答理，只是专心一致地读着《毛主席语录》。像这样动人的事例，我们在工作中碰到过不少次。
    外国朋友所以这样如饥似渴地学习《毛主席语录》，是因为毛主席的话代表着世界革命人民的利益，向世界革命人民指明了前进的道路，是世界人民革命斗争的最强大的思想武器。有一次，两位外国朋友一上飞机，就立刻拿出毛主席的著作来，全神贯注地学习毛主席关于武装斗争的理论。他们向乘务员说：毛主席说：“每个共产党员都应懂得这个真理：‘枪杆子里面出政权’。”我们现在就是到井冈山去参观取经的。还有许多来自越南、老挝等反美斗争前线的客人，经常让我们用中文教他们逐字逐句地念《毛主席语录》。他们说，从毛主席的话中，他们汲取了无穷无尽的斗争力量。
    林彪同志说：毛主席的话，水平最高，威信最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。外国朋友用高度的革命热情学习《毛主席语录》的情况，证明了毛主席的话在全世界越来越深入人心。毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了世界革命的航程，使世界人民看清了他们的光明前途。
