		*Australian "Pioneer"*

I have obtained a Japanese edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung." I read it every day. No matter which page I open, there are always words that touch the depths of people's souls, living words that fly from the pages into my mind.

		*Japan, Murata Shu*

Eating sugar is sweet in my mouth, reading Chairman Mao's quotations is sweet in my heart.

		*Mali, A Friend*

The radiant Mao Zedong Thought embodied in this red book with a red cover is extremely great and profound. I must strive to study it.

		*Azania, A Freedom Fighter*

I am very fond of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung." I can find all the essence of Chairman Mao's views in it. This is extremely important for us to study Chairman Mao's works.
