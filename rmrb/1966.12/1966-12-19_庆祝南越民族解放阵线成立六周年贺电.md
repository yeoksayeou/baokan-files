The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam
To the People of South Vietnam:

We, the people of the capital, ten million strong from all walks of life, are holding a grand rally today to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. On behalf of the entire Chinese people, we extend our warmest congratulations and highest respect to our brothers and sisters who are bravely fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle.

The heroic people of South Vietnam, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, are waging a powerful people's war and achieving great victories. The armed forces of South Vietnam have grown from small to large and are becoming stronger in battle. The U.S. imperialists are suffering more defeats. The great struggle of the South Vietnamese people has set an example of daring to fight and daring to win for all oppressed nations and peoples, greatly enriching the world's experience in anti-American armed struggle, and making a tremendous contribution to the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

Recently, the U.S. imperialists have ruthlessly bombed Hanoi. The heroic military and people of North Vietnam, in response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Call," have struck back at the American air pirates and achieved brilliant results. This is a powerful response to the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression and their "bombing for peace" plot, and a heavy blow to the leading clique of modern revisionism in the Soviet Union, the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

Chairman Mao said, "Create disorder, fail, create more disorder, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." This is exactly what U.S. imperialism is doing in Vietnam. We firmly believe that the iron will of the Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation is indestructible, and the Vietnamese people are invincible. No matter what "peace talks" tricks the U.S. imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries play, or what military adventures they plot, they cannot avoid their ultimate failure.

China and Vietnam are neighboring countries that depend on each other, and our two peoples are brothers and sisters. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, are fearless and will be a strong backing for the Vietnamese people. The great proletarian cultural revolution currently underway in our country is the most fundamental preparation for war for the Chinese people to support the Vietnamese people and oppose the U.S. imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression. We have long made up our minds to bear any sacrifice and take any risk to firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American, national salvation war to final victory.

Long live the victory of the Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation war!

Long live the combat friendship and great unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam!

    庆祝南越民族解放阵线成立六周年贺电越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会转越南南方人民：
    我们首都各界十万人民今天举行隆重集会，热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年。我们谨以全中国人民的名义，向英勇战斗在反美斗争最前线的越南南方的兄弟姐妹们致以最热烈的祝贺和最崇高的敬意。
    英雄的越南南方人民，在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，正在进行着气贯长虹的人民战争，取得了伟大胜利。越南南方人民的武装力量从小到大，越战越强；美帝国主义越败越惨。越南南方人民的伟大斗争，为一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民树立了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的榜样，大大丰富了全世界反美武装斗争经验的宝库，为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。
    美帝国主义最近丧心病狂地对河内狂轰滥炸。英雄的越南北方军民，坚决响应胡志明主席的“号召书”，迎头痛击美国空中强盗，取得了辉煌的战果。这是对美帝国主义战争讹诈和“以炸迫和”阴谋的有力回答，是对美帝国主义头号帮凶——苏联现代修正主义领导集团的沉重打击。
    毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义在越南正是这样。我们坚信，越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志是不可摧毁的，越南人民是不可战胜的。不论美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派玩弄什么“和谈”花招，策划什么军事冒险，都无法避免其最后失败的命运。
    中越两国是唇齿相依的邻邦，我们两国人民是情同手足的兄弟。用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民无所畏惧，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾。我国正在进行的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，是中国人民支援越南人民、反对美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的最根本的战备。我们早就下定决心，不怕任何牺牲，敢于承担任何风险，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到最后胜利。
    越南人民抗美救国战争胜利万岁！
    中越两国人民的战斗友谊和伟大团结万岁！
        首都各界人民声讨美帝轰炸越南
          首都河内和庆祝越南南方民族
          解放阵线成立六周年大会
                一九六六年十二月十八日
