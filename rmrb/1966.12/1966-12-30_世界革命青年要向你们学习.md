Respected Red Guards:

You are truly the revolutionary youth of the great era of Chairman Mao. You listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to his instructions, bravely making revolution. You are right! You have done well! Very well!

All revolutionary people around the world, especially the revolutionary youth of various countries, warmly praise and highly evaluate your revolutionary spirit and actions. You have set an example for them. They are determined to learn from you.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is one of the greatest and most profound proletarian revolutions in human history since the victory of the Chinese revolution. It is the greatest new driving force in history. Under the leadership of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of modern times, Chairman Mao, the great People's Republic of China is the hope of all revolutionary people in the world, a great base for world revolution. Therefore, the victory of the Chinese proletarian revolution is a common victory for the international proletariat! The victory of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only related to the future of the great destiny of the Chinese people but also to the future of all revolutionary people in the world.

In the face of the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guard movement, let the U.S. imperialists, revisionists, and all reactionaries tremble! What use are their hatred and their curses? This only shows the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought, the greatness of the Chinese people! It only shows that the revolutionary rebel spirit of the Red Guard youngsters is very good!

    世界革命青年要向你们学习敬爱的红卫兵战士们：
    你们不愧是伟大的毛泽东时代的中国革命青年。你们听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，勇敢地闹革命。你们做得对！做得好！好得很！
    全世界革命人民，特别是各国革命的青年一代热烈地赞扬和高度地评价你们的革命精神和革命行动。你们为他们做出了榜样。他们决心向你们学习。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命，是继中国革命胜利以来的人类历史上最伟大、最深刻的无产阶级革命之一，是最伟大的新的历史的推动力。伟大的中华人民共和国，在现代最最伟大的马列主义者毛主席的领导下，是全世界革命人民的希望，是世界革命的伟大根据地。因此，中国无产阶级革命的胜利，就是我们国际无产阶级的共同胜利！这次无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，不仅是关系到人民中国的更伟大的明天的命运，同时关系到全世界革命人民的明天的命运。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的胜利面前和红卫兵运动面前，让美帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派都发抖吧！它们的痛恨、它们的谩骂有什么用处呢？这只能说明毛泽东思想的伟大，中国人民的伟大！只能说明红卫兵小将们的革命造反精神好得很！
