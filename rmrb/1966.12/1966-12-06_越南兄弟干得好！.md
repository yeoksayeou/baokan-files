From December 2 to 4, the American aggressors launched dozens of sorties to savagely bomb the city of Hanoi. This is yet another vicious escalation of the U.S. imperialists' war in Vietnam. The military and civilian population of North Vietnam have bravely struck back at the American aggressors. We must shout to our Vietnamese brothers: You are doing great! Hit them hard, beat them up! The 700 million people of China will firmly stand behind you!

The U.S. imperialists have always been "honey-mouthed but dagger-hearted." The American aggressors' savage bombing of Hanoi is yet another proof of this.

Lately, the Americans have been singing the "peace" tune very loudly. The head of the American aggressors, Johnson, has been posing as a "savior," shouting everywhere about how "we should lay down our weapons and sit together at the table of reason," and "we should abandon the work of destroying our enemies and take on the task of letting people live," and so on. Modern revisionists have been frantically backing them up, doing their utmost to promote the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" fraud.

Chairman Mao has long taught us that "to understand the present and future of the reactionaries, look at their past and present." The facts have proven that the "peace" tactics used by the U.S. in the Vietnam War, although they appear to be varied and ever-changing on the surface, are all essentially the same: they use "peace" as a cover to expand the war of aggression in Vietnam.

The Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world have long seen through this: Johnson's recent "peace" tune is nothing but a smoke screen to cover the expansion of the war of aggression. Sure enough, the Johnson administration has now exposed its own "peace" mask through its actions.

The U.S. imperialists are not only like this in Vietnam, but also in the entire Asia, Africa, and Latin America, they are using the same counter-revolutionary two-pronged policy. Their policy of peace deception is serving their policy of aggression and war. In the words of the U.S. imperialists themselves, "peace strategy" is a supplementary means of war policy, using two hands "alternately or simultaneously" to ultimately make the whole world "submit" to American "rule of law."

The U.S. imperialists think they can force the Vietnamese people to surrender by sending in more troops and bombing Hanoi. This is completely a pipe dream. The heroic Vietnamese people, who have been fighting for more than twenty years for the independence and unification of their country, have given a resolute answer: Not one bit possible, not ten thousand bits possible! The 31 million heroic people of Vietnam will definitely respond to Chairman Ho's call, endure hardships, and fear no sacrifice, to carry the anti-American, national salvation struggle to the end, and drive the American aggressors out of Vietnamese soil, not leaving a single one behind!

### 越南兄弟干得好！

    越南兄弟干得好！
    十二月二日到四日，美国强盗两次出动数十架次飞机，野蛮地轰炸河内市。这是美帝国主义在侵越战争中采取的又一个穷凶极恶的战争“升级”行动。越南北方军民已经英勇地给美国强盗以迎头痛击。我们要向越南兄弟高呼：你们干得好！你们要狠狠地打，狠狠地揍！我们七亿中国人民坚决做你们的后盾！
    美帝国主义者一贯是“蜂蜜嘴，刀子心”。美国强盗这次野蛮轰炸河内市的战争罪行，又是一个新的证明。
    这一阵子，美国佬的“和平”调子唱得可高了。美国强盗头子约翰逊摆出一副“救世主”的面孔，到处叫嚷什么：“让我们放下武器，一起坐到理智的桌旁来”啦，“让我们放弃致敌人于死地的工作，而承担起让人活下去的任务”啦，等等。现代修正主义者也拚命帮腔，竭力为推销美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局效劳。
    毛主席早就教导我们，对于反动派“看它的过去，就可以知道它的现在；看它的过去和现在，就可以知道它的将来”。事实证明，美帝在侵越战争中玩弄的“和平”手法，尽管表面看起来五花八门、千变万化，但万变不离其宗，都是挂羊头，卖狗肉，用“和平”作幌子，行扩大侵越战争之实的鬼把戏。
    越南人民和世界革命人民早就看得清楚：约翰逊最近唱的“和平”调，不过是为扩大侵略战争放烟幕弹。果然，约翰逊政府现在又用它的行动，揭穿了自己的“和平”假面具。
    美帝国主义不仅在越南是这样，在整个亚、非、拉推行的也都是那一套反革命的两手政策。它的和平欺骗政策正是为它的侵略政策和战争政策服务的。用美帝国主义自己的话说，“和平战略”是战争政策的补充手段，两手“交替采用或兼施并用”，以达到最终使全世界“服膺”美国“法治”的目的。
    美帝国主义想用大举增兵和轰炸河内的办法迫使越南人民屈服。这完全是白日做梦。为了祖国的独立和统一而流血奋战二十多年的英雄越南人民的坚决回答是：一千个办不到，一万个办不到！越南三千一百万英雄人民一定要坚决响应胡主席的号召，不畏艰苦，不怕牺牲，把抗美救国斗争进行到底，把美国侵略者一个不剩地通通从越南的土地上赶出去！解放军某部
