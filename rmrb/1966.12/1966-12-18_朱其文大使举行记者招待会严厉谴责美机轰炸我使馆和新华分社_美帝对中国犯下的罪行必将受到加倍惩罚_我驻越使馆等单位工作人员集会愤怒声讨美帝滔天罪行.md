Ambassador Zhu Qifeng Holds Press Conference Strongly Condemning U.S. Airstrikes on Chinese Embassy and Xinhua Bureau
The Crimes Committed by U.S. Imperialism Against China Will Surely Be Punished in Kind
Staff of Chinese Embassy in Vietnam and Other Units Hold Meeting to Angrily Denounce U.S. Imperialism's Heinous Crimes

	HA NOI, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Qifeng, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, held a press conference in the afternoon of Dec. 17 to strongly condemn and protest in the strongest terms the serious provocation of the U.S. bandit planes bombing the Chinese Embassy and the Xinhua Bureau.

	Ambassador Zhu Qifeng, in his speech at the conference, stressed that the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. Every crime committed by U.S. imperialism against China will surely be thoroughly settled. The crimes of U.S. imperialism will surely be punished in kind.

	Ambassador Zhu Qifeng first accompanied the reporters to inspect the scene of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy by the U.S. bandit planes and the evidence of the bombing, and gave a detailed account of the bombing. He then read out the statement of the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on Dec. 16 and made a speech.

	Ambassador Zhu Qifeng said that on the afternoon of Dec. 14, U.S. bandit planes again made a series of mad bombing raids on the heroic Vietnamese people's capital, Ha Noi, causing heavy casualties among the citizens and serious damage to buildings. At the same time, four U.S. planes circled over the diplomatic quarter in Ha Noi. At 3:24 p.m., two of them suddenly dived and bombed the Chinese Embassy, causing serious damage to the buildings of the Chinese Embassy. The buildings of the Xinhua Bureau in Ha Noi were also damaged. The entire staff of the Chinese Embassy expressed their utmost indignation at this heinous crime of U.S. imperialism.

	Ambassador Zhu Qifeng said that the U.S. imperialists sent their bandit planes to attack the Chinese Embassy and the Xinhua Bureau, which is another extremely serious act of war provocation against the Chinese people. The U.S. government must bear all the serious consequences arising therefrom.

	Ambassador Zhu Qifeng pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' savage bombing of the Chinese Embassy was a deliberate, planned crime. The U.S. imperialists hate the Chinese people so deeply because the Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are the most resolute in opposing imperialism, reactionaries of all countries and modern revisionism, the most resolute in supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and the most resolute in supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the whole world.

	Ambassador Zhu Qifeng said that the situation of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression is excellent. The U.S. imperialists' war of aggression is in a desperate plight under the heavy blows of the heroic Vietnamese people. Their mad bombing of the Ha Noi area and the attack on the Chinese Embassy fully reveal their dog-like, cornered, extremely weak nature. Chairman Mao said: "To disturb, to fail, to disturb again, to fail again, till they are routed -- this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries the world over in dealing with the people's cause, and they will never be able to depart from this logic. This is a law of Marxism." The U.S. imperialists' desperate, dog-like struggles, although encouraged and closely coordinated by modern revisionism, in an attempt to push forward their great conspiracy of "bombing to force surrender" against the Vietnamese people, will never be able to save themselves from their final doom in the face of the 31 million Vietnamese people who are determined to fight to the end.

	Ambassador Zhu Qifeng said that the staff of the Chinese Embassy are fearless proletarian diplomats armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao has always taught us to "make up our minds, not to be afraid of sacrifice, to overcome all difficulties, and to strive for victory." We are shouldering the glorious mission of aiding Vietnam and fighting against U.S. aggression entrusted to us by the seven hundred million Chinese people. The U.S. imperialists want to intimidate us with bombing. This is completely a case of mistaking the object. The U.S. imperialists' any mad provocation and war threats will not in the least shake our unshakable stand of resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression. We most resolutely and warmly support the solemn declaration of Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the great leader of the Vietnamese people, on July 17. We will surely forever stand together with the heroic Vietnamese people, fight together and win together! U.S. imperialism is doomed to defeat! The Vietnamese people are sure to win!

	Mr. Vu Dien, Director of the News Department of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Chau Thuc Thong, Chief of the First Asian Section, and news officials of various embassies in Vietnam also attended the press conference.

	HA NOI, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- The staff of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam and the Xinhua Bureau in Ha Noi held a meeting in the afternoon of Dec. 17 to strongly condemn and angrily denounce the savage crime of the U.S. bandit planes bombing the Chinese Embassy and the Xinhua Bureau on Dec. 14.

	The meeting hall was decorated with the quotation from Chairman Mao: "Make up your minds, not to be afraid of sacrifice, to overcome all difficulties, and to strive for victory."

	First Secretary Chen Liang read out the letter of condolence from the Party Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the revolutionary comrades of the Xinhua News Agency to all the comrades of the Embassy and the Xinhua Bureau. Then, representatives of the Embassy, the Xinhua Bureau, the Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission in Vietnam, Chinese experts and students in Vietnam spoke at the meeting with indignant hearts, unanimously strongly condemning this serious act of provocation by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people and exposing the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy of "bombing to force surrender" in collusion with modern revisionism and other accomplices. They pointed out unanimously that the Vietnamese people are not to be intimidated, and neither are the Chinese people. The diplomatic fighters armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought are fearless and unafraid of any sacrifice. The U.S. imperialists want to use war threats to force us to abandon our internationalist duty of aiding the Vietnamese people, which is absolutely impossible. They expressed their determination to support the statement of our government on Dec. 15 and the statement of the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Dec. 16, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to further promote the revolutionization of our thinking, to be unafraid of hardships and unafraid of death, to fight together with the heroic Vietnamese people to the end, to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors, and to accomplish the glorious mission entrusted to us by the Party and the motherland.

	Ambassador Zhu Qifeng also spoke at the meeting. He called on all the Chinese staff in Vietnam to actively respond to the call of Comrade Lin Biao, to study Chairman Mao's works seriously, to stand together with the heroic Vietnamese people, to fight together and to win together.

	The meeting adopted a resolution to the Party Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressing the determination of all the Chinese staff in Vietnam to hold high the revolutionary banner of opposing imperialism, opposing modern revisionism and upholding proletarian internationalism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to fight together with the people of the motherland and the people of the world to thoroughly defeat imperialism, modern revisionism and the reactionaries of all countries, and not to rest until the goal is achieved.

	At the end of the meeting, all the comrades raised their fists and shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Vietnam will win, U.S. imperialism will be defeated!" "The seven hundred million Chinese people will forever be the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people!" "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao, the great supreme commander, the great helmsman, a thousand times, ten thousand times!"

    朱其文大使举行记者招待会严厉谴责美机轰炸我使馆和新华分社
    美帝对中国犯下的罪行必将受到加倍惩罚
    我驻越使馆等单位工作人员集会愤怒声讨美帝滔天罪行
    新华社河内十七日电　中华人民共和国驻越南民主共和国特命全权大使朱其文，十七日下午举行记者招待会，严厉谴责和强烈抗议美国强盗飞机轰炸中国大使馆和新华分社的严重挑衅行为。朱其文大使在会上发表谈话时强调指出，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不好惹的，美帝国主义对中国犯下的每一桩罪行，一定要彻底清算，美帝国主义的罪恶，必将得到加倍的惩罚。
    朱其文大使首先陪同记者们察看了中国大使馆被美国强盗飞机轰炸的现场和美机轰炸的罪证，详细介绍了被轰炸的经过。接着，他宣读了中华人民共和国外交部发言人十二月十六日的声明，然后发表了谈话。
    朱其文大使说，十四日下午，美国强盗飞机多批再次疯狂轰炸英雄的越南人民的首都河内市区，造成了市民的重大伤亡和建筑物的严重破坏。与此同时，四架美国飞机在河内市内的使馆区上空盘旋，下午三时二十四分，其中两架美国飞机竟然俯冲轰炸中国大使馆，使中国大使馆房屋遭受了严重破坏，新华社河内分社的房屋也受到破坏。中国大使馆全体工作人员，对美帝国主义这一罪恶滔天的暴行，表示无比愤慨。
    朱其文大使说，美帝国主义派遣强盗飞机袭击中国大使馆和新华分社，是它对中国人民的又一次极为严重的战争挑衅。美国政府必须承担由此而引起的全部严重后果。
    朱其文大使指出，美帝国主义野蛮轰炸中国大使馆，完全是蓄意的、有计划的罪恶行为。美帝国主义如此刻骨仇恨中国人民，是因为中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，反对帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义最坚决，支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争最坚决，支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界各国人民的革命斗争最坚决。
    朱其文说，当前，越南人民抗美战争的形势好得很。美帝国主义的侵略战争在英勇的越南人民的沉重打击下，已经走投无路，它狂轰滥炸河内市区，袭击中国大使馆，十足地表现出它狗急跳墙的十分虚弱的本质。毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。”美帝国主义这种疯狗式的垂死挣扎，虽然得到现代修正主义的积极鼓励和紧密配合，妄图对越南人民加紧推行“以炸迫和”的大阴谋，但是在三千一百万决战决胜的越南人民面前，绝不能挽救它最后失败的命运。
    朱其文大使说，中国大使馆工作人员是由毛泽东思想武装起来的大无畏的无产阶级外交战士。毛主席一贯教导我们，要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我们肩负着七亿中国人民赋予的援越抗美的光荣使命，美帝国主义妄想用轰炸来吓唬我们，这真是完全看错了对象。美帝国主义的任何疯狂的挑衅和战争恫吓，都丝毫不能动摇我们坚决支持越南人民抗美斗争的坚定立场。我们最坚决、最热烈地支持越南人民伟大领袖胡志明主席七月十七日的庄严声明，我们一定永远同英雄的越南人民团结在一起，斗争在一起，胜利在一起！美帝国主义必败！越南人民必胜！
    越南外交部新闻司司长吴田，第一亚洲司专员周寿通，以及各国驻越南使馆新闻官员，也出席了记者招待会。
    新华社河内十七日电中国驻越南大使馆和新华社河内分社的工作人员，十七日下午举行集会，强烈谴责和愤怒声讨美国强盗飞机十四日悍然轰炸中国大使馆和新华分社的野蛮罪行。
    会场上悬挂着毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。” 
    大使馆参赞陈亮首先在大会上宣读了中国外交部党委和新华社总社全体革命同志给使馆和新华分社全体同志的慰问信。接着，大使馆、新华分社和中国驻越南经济代表处、中国专家和留学生的代表，以无比愤怒的心情，纷纷在会上讲话，一致严厉声讨美帝国主义向中国人民蓄意进行的这一严重挑衅罪行，并且揭露了美帝国主义伙同现代修正主义及其他帮凶，加紧向越南人民推行“以炸迫和”的恶毒阴谋。他们一致指出，越南人民是吓不倒的，中国人民也是吓不倒的。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的外交战士，是无所畏惧、不怕任何牺牲的。美帝国主义妄图用战争威胁来迫使我们放弃援助越南人民的国际主义义务，是绝对办不到的。他们表示，坚决拥护我国政府十五日的声明和外交部发言人十六日的声明，要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，进一步促进思想革命化，不怕苦，不怕死，誓同英雄的越南人民一起战斗到底，彻底打败美国侵略者，完成党和祖国交给的光荣任务。
    朱其文大使也在会上讲了话。他号召中国驻越南的全体工作人员，要积极响应林彪同志的号召，认真学习毛主席著作，坚决和英雄的越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    大会通过了给外交部党委的决心书，表示全体驻越人员决心在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，更高地举起反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和坚持无产阶级国际主义的革命旗帜，同祖国人民和世界人民一道，彻底打倒帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，不达目的誓不罢休。
    在大会结束时，全体同志振臂高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“越南必胜，美帝必败！”“七亿中国人民永远作越南人民的坚强后盾！”“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
