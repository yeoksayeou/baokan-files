In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers of various ethnic groups at the Karamay Oilfield in Xinjiang, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have smashed the bourgeois technical "authorities" and broken the foreign frameworks, bringing about an unprecedentedly good situation in oilfield production. By the middle of December this year, the annual production tasks for oil extraction, refining, and drilling have all been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, with all indicators showing a significant increase compared to last year. The scale and achievements of technological innovation and technological revolution in the oilfield this year are unparalleled in any previous year.

At the beginning of the development of the Karamay Oilfield, it was severely constrained by the rigid frameworks of foreign revisionism. In recent years, the workers have managed the enterprise according to Mao Zedong Thought, leading the oilfield out of a dead end, rapidly changing its appearance, and improving production year by year.

This year, under the impetus of the great proletarian cultural revolution, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the oil workers of various ethnic groups has soared. They have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, dispelled their illusions about foreigners, and smashed their illusions about bourgeois technical "authorities." They have broken the foreign frameworks and launched a revolution in production. Originally, a foreign-designed oilfield gathering and transportation process had many problems and a low degree of automation, relying entirely on manual operation. This year, during the Cultural Revolution, the workers decided to overthrow this foreign process and create their own new technology. At this time, the bourgeois "authorities" said that without electronic computers and wireless remote control devices, it would be very difficult to achieve automated production. The workers studied Chairman Mao's instructions: "What is work? Work is struggle. ... We work and struggle to solve difficulties." They did not believe in the "authorities" at all. The workers endured the scorching heat of over 40 degrees Celsius on the Gobi Desert, worked on the wells, and ate on the wells, overcoming numerous difficulties, and finally smashed this foreign process and achieved automation. The adoption of this new technology saved 50% of labor, more than 90% of steel, and 80% of investment. More importantly, it ensured the complete and accurate collection of data, thus solving the problem of individual metering after the implementation of stratified exploitation of oil wells.

### 遵照毛主席教导大破资产阶级“权威”  克拉玛依油田超额完成今年生产任务

    遵照毛主席教导大破资产阶级“权威”
    克拉玛依油田超额完成今年生产任务
    据新华社乌鲁木齐二十八日电　在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，新疆克拉玛依油田的各族职工，依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，大破资产阶级技术“权威”，大破洋框框，使油田生产出现了前所未有的大好形势。到今年十二月上旬，采油、炼油、钻井的全年生产任务，都已提前超额完成，各项指标都比去年有大幅度的增长。今年油田技术革新技术革命规模之大、成果之多，也是以往任何一年不能比拟的。
    克拉玛依油田在开发之初，就受到外国修正主义死框框的严重束缚。最近几年，职工们按照毛泽东思想办企业，使油田从死胡同里走了出来，面貌迅速改变，生产一年比一年好。
    今年，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，各族石油职工的革命干劲大大高涨。他们用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，破除对洋人的迷信，破除对资产阶级技术“权威”的迷信，大破洋框框，在生产上大闹革命。原来外国设计的一种油田集输流程，毛病很多，自动化程度低，全靠手工操作。今年，在文化大革命中，职工们决心打倒这个洋流程，创造自己的新工艺。这时，资产阶级“权威”就说什么没有电子计算机和无线电遥控装置，很难实现生产自动化。工人们学习了毛主席的教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。……我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”根本不信
  “权威”的那一套。职工们冒着戈壁滩上摄氏四十度左右的燥热，干在井上，吃在井上，克服了重重困难，终于把这个洋流程打了个稀巴烂，实现了自动化。这种新工艺的采用，使劳动力节省了百分之五十，钢材节省了百分之九十以上，投资节约了百分之八十。更重要的是能取全取准资料，从而解决了油井实行分层开采后的单独计量问题。
