The glorious anti-revisionist fighters, the delegation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions attending the 16th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions held in Sofia, led by the delegation head Han Xiya and deputy head Lu Zongying, returned triumphantly to Beijing this noon.

Under the banner of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the Chinese trade union delegation resolutely fought against the Soviet revisionists and their small clique of followers who manipulated the council meeting and created anti-China incidents at the 16th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions. When they returned to the capital airport, more than a thousand officials from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and workers from Beijing welcomed them. They held up portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations, beat drums and gongs, and enthusiastically cheered for the anti-revisionist fighters, saying they did the right thing, did it well, and achieved great victories.

The workers of the capital held a welcoming rally at the airport. They waved red flags and shouted slogans, expressing their resolute support for the just struggle of our country's trade union delegation, their strongest protest against the World Federation of Trade Unions' arrogant deprivation of our country's delegation's right to attend the meeting, their indignant condemnation of the Soviet revisionists' anti-China crimes at the World Federation of Trade Unions' council, and their determination to carry the struggle against American imperialism and modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU to the end.

After Vice Chairman Kang Yonghe of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions announced the beginning of the welcoming rally, all the comrades held up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and recited together: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. It looks as though the reactionaries are terrible, but in reality they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, the real power does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people. ... The people of the whole world, unite and defeat the American aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the whole world, be courageous, dare to fight, do not be afraid of difficulties, and go forward wave upon wave. Then the whole world will surely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be routed."

Vice Chairman Ma Chunwu of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the serious incident of the Soviet revisionists brazenly splitting the World Federation of Trade Unions and launching a new wave of anti-China activities clearly exposed their traitorous and scab-like faces of being anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary.

Ma Chunwu enthusiastically praised the Chinese trade union delegation for completing the task entrusted to them by the working masses of our country in this anti-revisionist struggle and expressed his respect for their firm proletarian stance and tenacious fighting spirit displayed in the struggle. He said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'To be opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing.' Chairman Mao said: 'If the enemy vigorously opposes us, slanders us, and says we are utterly worthless, that would be even better, for it would prove that we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation between ourselves and the enemy but also that our work has been very successful.' At the 16th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Soviet revisionists were so vigorously hostile to the Chinese trade union delegation, afraid of the voice of the Chinese workers, and deprived the Chinese trade unions of their legitimate rights, which proves that our delegation did the right thing and did it well."

He denounced the Soviet revisionists and their small clique of lackeys for shouting about "purifying" the atmosphere of the World Federation of Trade Unions and taking "organizational measures" against our country's trade unions. Ma Chunwu said, "Can these things frighten our working class and prevent us from opposing imperialism and revisionism? A thousand noes, ten thousand noes. 'Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and no heroes fear bears and wolves.' We believe that the international working class will certainly 'purify' its ranks and throw a small clique of traitorous scabs into the dustbin of history."

In his speech, Ma Chunwu strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists for shamelessly colluding with imperialism to spread rumors and slander, viciously attacking our great proletarian cultural revolution, and rudely interfering in the internal affairs of our trade unions. He said, "We must warn them: you have miscalculated. Your wild dreams and treacherous actions will surely be smashed to pieces against the copper-wall-iron-wall of the Chinese working masses, and your backward and reactionary actions will not harm a single hair of our working class and trade unions. You are digging your own graves."

Ma Chunwu hoped that the delegation members would, upon their return to the country, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, actively participate in the proletarian cultural revolution, and temper themselves in the storms of international and domestic class struggle to become even stronger anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist fighters.

Delegation head Han Xiya began his speech amid enthusiastic applause. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionists manipulated the meeting and arrogantly made a decision to exclude the Chinese delegation because they were afraid that the Chinese delegation would expose to the world their traitorous and scab-like faces of colluding with American imperialism, suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world, and betraying the fundamental interests of the international working class. This is precisely a manifestation of their weakness and panic.

Han Xiya said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'To create disorder, fail, create disorder again, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the cause of the people. They will never deviate from this logic.' Now, the leadership clique of Soviet revisionism is rolling down the road to complete failure and complete bankruptcy."

He said that in this victorious struggle against modern revisionism, the invincible thought of Mao Zedong gave the delegation immense strength and great encouragement. This struggle made us deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat and the most effective mirror to expose modern revisionism.

After the speeches by Ma Chunwu and Han Xiya, the entire audience shouted slogans: "Long live the great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong! Long live the great Communist Party of China! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years, ten thousand years!"

Also present at the airport to welcome the delegation were Vice Chairmen Zhu Lifan and Gu Daqin of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Secretary Zhang Weizhen of the Secretariat, and heads of various departments of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Tang Zhang, Zhang Ze'an, and Wang Jiachun.

On the afternoon of the 10th, when the Chinese trade union delegation boarded the plane to leave Sofia, Chinese Ambassador to Bulgaria Xie Bangzhi, embassy staff, and Chinese students studying in Bulgaria were at the airport to enthusiastically see off the glorious anti-revisionist fighters and the great envoys of the Chinese working class returning home in triumph. Also present at the airport to see them off were Albanian Ambassador to Bulgaria Dello Ballari, members of the Albanian trade union delegation, the Vietnam Democratic Republic trade union delegation, and the Vietnam South Liberation Trade Union Federation delegation.

    苏修反华反共反人民反革命丑恶嘴脸毕露
    国际工人阶级必将把叛徒丢进历史垃圾堆
    首都工人代表热烈欢迎在世界工联会议上进行坚决斗争的中国工会代表团胜利归来
    据新华社十二日讯　光荣的反修战士，出席在索非亚举行的世界工联第十六次理事会会议的中国工会代表团全体成员，在团长韩西雅和副团长卢宗英率领下，今天中午胜利回到北京。
    中国工会代表团高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在世界工联第十六次理事会会议上，同一手操纵理事会会议、制造反华事件的苏联修正主义者及其一小撮追随者，进行了坚决的斗争。他们今天回到首都机场时，前往欢迎的中华全国总工会的负责人和首都工人代表一千多人，高举毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌，敲锣打鼓，热烈欢呼反修战士们做得对，做得好，取得了很大的胜利。
    前往欢迎的首都工人在机场上举行了欢迎大会。他们挥动红旗，高呼口号，表示最坚决地支持我国工会代表团的严正斗争，最强烈抗议世界工联横蛮剥夺我国代表团出席会议的权利，愤怒谴责苏联修正主义在世界工联理事会上的反华罪行，并表示中国工人和人民一定要把反对美帝国主义和反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    全总副主任康永和宣布欢迎大会开始后，全体同志捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，齐声朗诵：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    全总副主任马纯古在会上讲话。他指出，苏联修正主义者悍然分裂世界工联、掀起新的反华浪潮的严重事件，再清楚不过地暴露了他们的反华、反共、反人民、反革命的叛徒和工贼嘴脸。
    马纯古热烈赞扬中国工会代表团在这场反修斗争中完成了我国工人群众委托给他们的任务，并对他们在斗争中表现出来的坚定的无产阶级立场和英勇顽强的斗争精神表示敬意。他说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”毛主席说：“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”在世界工联第十六次理事会会议上，苏联修正主义者这样起劲地仇视中国工会代表团，害怕中国工人的声音，剥夺中国工会的正当权利，就证明我们的代表团做得对，做得好。
    他痛斥苏联修正主义者和它们的一小撮走卒叫嚣要“净化”世界工联的气氛，对我国工会采取“组织措施”。马纯古说，难道这些就能吓倒我国的工人阶级，不去反帝，不去反修吗？一千个不可能，一万个不可能。“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”我们相信，国际工人阶级必将“净化”自己的队伍，把一小撮叛徒工贼丢到历史的垃圾堆里去。
    马纯古在讲话中强烈谴责苏联修正主义者无耻地配合帝国主义大肆造谣诬蔑，对我国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命进行恶毒攻击，对我国工会内部事务进行粗暴干涉。他说，我们要正告他们：你们打错了算盘，你们的痴心妄想和叛逆行动必定要在中国工人群众的铜墙铁壁面前碰得头破血流，你们倒行逆施无损于我国工人阶级、我国工会的一根毫毛，你们是在自掘坟墓。
    马纯古希望代表团同志们在回国之后，更要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，在国际、国内阶级斗争的风浪里经受锻炼，使自己成为更加坚强的反帝、反修战士。
    代表团团长韩西雅在热烈的掌声中开始讲话。他指出，苏联修正主义者操纵会议，蛮横地作出排斥中国代表团的决定，是因为他们害怕中国代表团向全世界揭露他们勾结美帝国主义、镇压世界人民革命斗争、出卖国际工人阶级根本利益的叛徒和工贼的嘴脸。这正是他们虚弱和惊慌的表现。
    韩西雅说，毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”现在，苏联修正主义领导集团正朝着彻底失败、彻底破产的道路滚下去。
    他说，这一次同现代修正主义的胜利的斗争中，战无不胜的毛泽东思想给了代表团无比的力量和极大的鼓舞。这次斗争使我们更加深刻地体会到毛泽东思想是无产阶级最强大的思想武器，是揭露现代修正主义最有力的照妖镜。
    马纯古和韩西雅讲话以后，全场高呼口号：“伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    今天到机场欢迎的，还有中华全国总工会副主任朱学范、顾大椿，书记处书记张维桢，以及全总各部门负责人唐章、张则荪、王家宠等。
    中国工会代表团十日下午乘飞机离索非亚时，中国驻保加利亚大使谢邦治，以及使馆工作人员和我国留保学生，到机场热烈欢送光荣的反修战士，伟大的中国工人阶级的使者凯旋回国。到飞机场欢送的，还有阿尔巴尼亚驻保加利亚大使德洛·巴利里，以及阿尔巴尼亚工会代表团、越南民主共和国工会代表团、越南南方解放工会联合会代表团的成员。
