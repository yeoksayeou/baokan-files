I am an old livestock keeper, but in the past, I could not raise strong animals. After studying the "Three Articles," I managed to fatten a cow that no one else wanted to feed. Someone asked me for advice, and I said:

	The Sun in My Heart, Thoughts Changed, Livestock Transformed
	Liú Jiǔzhēn

I am an old livestock keeper. In terms of technique, I am one of the best in the entire brigade. Therefore, the brigade always gave me special treatment, often praising me highly. However, in the past, although the brigade treated me well, I did not treat the brigade well. I was selfish and my thoughts were far from the collective. I only thought about earning more work points; while in the livestock shed, my mind was on my private plot. So, the livestock was always weak.

Since last year, the brigade party branch has been vigorously promoting the study of Chairman Mao's works. Through study, Mao Zedong Thought illuminated my heart, and my mind began to change: White was a famous foreign doctor, but he treated the Chinese revolution as his own cause and worked tirelessly for it. Zhang Sided was an old Red Army soldier who had gone through the Long March, and he sacrificed his life for the revolution by burning charcoal. Why did they do this? Wasn't it for the revolution, for the liberation of mankind, for the happiness of future generations! And I am a member of a people's commune. Why can't I raise the livestock well? Chairman Mao's books are like a golden key that instantly unlocked the rusty chains in my mind. My class consciousness was raised, and I began to connect raising livestock with the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. From then on, my thoughts broadened, and my vision became far-reaching. I replaced my thoughts of "eating," "clothing," "children," and "family" with "collective," "the brigade's livestock," "state," and "revolution." In a study session, I painfully examined my wrong thoughts and regretted not reading Chairman Mao's books and listening to Chairman Mao's words earlier. I resolved to raise the livestock well for the revolution.

The fifth brigade had a cow that was very weak and listless, and no one wanted to feed it. Some people wanted to slaughter it, and others suggested selling it. After learning about this, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties." So, I volunteered: "Give the weak cow to me to feed. I will work tirelessly, even to the point of exhaustion, to fatten this weak cow." The brigade cadres saw my determination and agreed.

After taking on the task of feeding the weak cow, I devoted all my energy to it. In winter, it was cold, so I spread straw and covered the cow with a sheepskin coat. Every day, I carefully gave the cow water and fine feed. In this way, after several months of diligent care, I finally fattened the cow that was "waiting to be skinned and eaten" into a plump one. Some livestock keepers saw that I had fattened the weak cow and asked me for advice. I said: "Livestock keeping is all about ideology. The Sun in my heart, thoughts changed, livestock transformed. I fattened the weak cow with Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, we must work hard to study Chairman Mao's works even better."

    我是个老饲养员，过去却喂不壮牲畜。学习了“老三篇”，我把没人肯喂的瘦牛喂肥了。有人向我取经，我说：
    心中有了红太阳  人换思想畜变样

    我是一个老饲养员，论技术是全大队数一数二的。因此，队里总是特别“优待”我，常把我捧得高高的。可是，过去队里优待我，我却不“优待”队里。我这个人过去私心很重，思想不沾集体的边，光想自己多挣工分；身在饲养室，心在自留地，所以牲口老是喂不壮。
    去年以来，大队党支部狠抓了毛主席著作的学习。通过学习，毛泽东思想照亮了我的心，我脑子里翻腾开了：白求恩是个有名的外国大夫，却把中国革命事业当作他自己的事业，拚上命干。张思德是个经过长征的老红军，为革命烧木炭，牺牲了生命。他们是为了什么呢？还不是为了革命，为了人类解放，为了子孙后代的幸福！而我是个人民公社社员，为什么不能把牲口喂好呢？毛主席的书，像一把金钥匙，一下子打开了我思想上的锈锁。我的阶级觉悟提高了，也就把喂牲口和中国革命、世界革命联系起来。从此，我想的宽了，看的远了，把心上的“吃饭”、“穿衣”、“孩子”、“家庭”，换成了“集体”、“队里的牲畜”、“国家”、“革命”。在一次学习会上，我痛心地检查了自己的错误思想，后悔自己没有早读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话。我下决心，为革命喂好牲畜。
    第五队有一头牛，瘦弱得很，有气无力，没有人肯喂它。有人要杀掉，有的人主张卖掉。我知道这件事后，想到毛主席的教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”于是，我主动提出：“把瘦牛交给我喂，我就是熬死累死，也要把这头瘦牛喂肥。”队干部见我态度坚定，就答应了。
    我接受了喂瘦牛的任务以后，就把全部精力都用在牛身上。冬天天冷，我怕牛冻着，就铺上麦秸，给牛盖上皮袄。平日，我细心地给牛饮水，喂细草料。就这样，经过几个月的精心喂养，终于把这头“等着剥皮吃肉”的瘦牛喂得圆胖胖的。有些饲养员见我把瘦牛喂壮了，向我取经，我说：“饲养饲养，全靠思想。心中有了红太阳，人换思想畜变样。我是靠毛泽东思想把瘦牛喂壮的，咱们今后得下苦功夫把毛主席著作学得更好。”
