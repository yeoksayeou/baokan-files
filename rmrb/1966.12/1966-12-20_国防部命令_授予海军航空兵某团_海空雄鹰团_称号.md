In every battle, they have shown an invincible spirit, fighting resolutely, intelligently, bravely, and tenaciously, achieving brilliant results and successfully completing their combat missions. The Ministry of National Defense hopes that all comrades in the regiment will remain humble, avoid arrogance and impatience, continue to strive for excellence, maintain and further carry forward their honor, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They should study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently, always emphasize politics, summarize experiences seriously, and train hard to master solid skills. The order finally calls upon them to be highly vigilant, be ready for battle at any time, and resolutely and thoroughly annihilate any enemy aircraft that dares to invade. This is to safeguard national security, thwart the enemy's war plots, and strive for greater victories.
