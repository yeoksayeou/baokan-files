	New China News Agency Hong Kong, December 9th

	After the Guangdong Provincial People's Radio Station broadcasted the news on the 8th that thousands of Red Guards from universities and colleges in Guangzhou held a rally and demonstration on the 7th, strongly protesting against the brutal massacre of Macau Chinese compatriots by the Portuguese authorities in Macau, and vowing to be the backbone of Macau compatriots, the broad masses of Macau patriots were filled with boundless excitement. They spread the news to each other, expressing their determination to resolutely fight against the Portuguese imperialists in Macau to the end, and not to rest until they achieve complete victory.

	Many workers told reporters from the "Macau Daily" that the Red Guards are the heroes of the Chinese people. What they say, they do. All the ghosts and demons in the world tremble at the sound of their voices. The workers also said: The Red Guards are right. The Chinese people are not to be trifled with. The Portuguese authorities must pay for their blood debt and thoroughly admit their crimes.

	The responsible person of the Macau Federation of Chinese Students said, "The support from the motherland and the Red Guards has given us all the students in Macau immeasurable strength. We are determined to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards. No matter what happens, we can stand firm."

	The responsible person of the Macau Women's Federation said, "Our Red Guards say what they mean. If the Portuguese imperialists in Macau do not immediately stop their persecution of the Chinese compatriots in Macau and promptly accept the just demands of the Chinese compatriots in Macau, we will resolutely fight to the end."

	The broad masses of patriotic compatriots in Macau pointed out that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are fearless, dare to struggle, and are good at struggling. If the Portuguese imperialists dare to continue to be enemies of the Chinese people, they will definitely break their backs. We have the Red Guards as our backbone, and we are filled with a hundredfold confidence in victory.

    坚决同澳葡帝国主义者斗争到底
    新华社香港九日电  当广东省人民广播电台八日播出广州市大专院校数千红卫兵七日举行集会和示威游行，严正抗议澳门葡萄牙当局残酷屠杀澳门中国同胞，誓作澳门同胞后盾的消息后，广大的澳门爱国同胞怀着无比振奋的心情，奔走相告，他们纷纷表示，坚决要同澳门葡萄牙帝国主义者斗争到底，不获全胜，决不罢休。
    许多工人群众对《澳门日报》的记者发表谈话时指出：红卫兵小将是我们中国人民的英雄后代，他们说得到做得到，世界上的一切牛鬼蛇神无不闻声丧胆。工人们还说：红卫兵小将说得对，中国人民是不好惹的，澳葡当局必须偿还血债，彻底低头认罪。
    澳门中华学生联合会的负责人说，祖国人民对我们的支持，红卫兵对我们的支持，使我们全澳门同学增添了无穷的力量。我们决心向红卫兵的革命造反精神学习，天塌下来也能顶得住。
    澳门妇女联合会的负责人说，我们红卫兵说一不二。如果澳门葡萄牙帝国主义仍不迅速停止对澳门中国同胞的迫害，迅速接受澳门中国同胞的严正要求，我们就要坚决斗争到底。
    澳门广大爱国同胞纷纷指出，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，无所畏惧，敢于斗争，善于斗争。葡萄牙帝国主义如果胆敢继续与中国人民为敌，就一定要打断他们的脊骨。我们有红卫兵作后盾，我们充满着百倍的胜利信心。
