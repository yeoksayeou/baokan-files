Comrades,

The 41 overseas Chinese youth, through their brave struggle, have finally defeated the numerous persecutions and various conspiracies of the Indonesian reactionaries, and have triumphantly returned to our great socialist motherland. Now, you have come to the heart of our motherland, to the side of our great leader Chairman Mao. On behalf of Chairman Mao and his closest comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, I warmly welcome you and extend to you the most cordial greetings!

The 41 youth, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved a brilliant victory in their struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries, which is another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought.

The 41 youth are a heroic fighting collective. In the "reception centers" and prisons of the Indonesian reactionaries, you held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and followed Chairman Mao's teachings to fight. Under the threat of the guns and bayonets of the fascist military, you firmly defended the dignity of the socialist motherland, fully demonstrating the revolutionary heroism of fearlessness in the face of violence, fearlessness of sacrifice, daring to struggle, and daring to win. Your struggle and victory have greatly crushed the reactionary arrogance of the Indonesian reactionaries and imperialism, and boosted the revolutionary spirit of overseas patriotic compatriots, the Chinese people, and the people of the world.

The heroic deeds of the 41 youth have set a brilliant example for overseas Chinese, as well as for the people of the entire nation. We should learn from these little heroes of the Mao Zedong era.

Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era in which imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing towards global victory. It is the guiding principle for all the work of our entire Party and nation, and the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to defeat imperialism, the reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionism.

Currently, the people of the entire nation are actively responding to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, turning the entire nation into a school of Mao Zedong Thought. Overseas Chinese should, like the people of the entire nation, seriously and diligently study Chairman Mao's works, truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought. Only those armed with Mao Zedong Thought can have a firm and correct political direction and a vigorous fighting will in the turbulent waves of international class struggle, possess the great revolutionary spirit of overcoming all enemies and never being subdued by enemies, and resolutely fight against imperialism, the reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionism.

The right-wing military clique in Indonesia is playing the shameful role of running dogs for U.S. imperialism, stirring up a counter-revolutionary frenzy in Indonesia. They have adopted inhuman fascist methods, carrying out large-scale massacres of Indonesian revolutionary masses, and bloodbaths in the archipelago. Under the control of the right-wing military clique, the Indonesian government, to cater to the needs of U.S. imperialism, is speeding up its reactionary policies. While they are frantically engaging in anti-communist and anti-people activities, they are also escalating their anti-Chinese and expelling-Chinese activities, brutally persecuting Chinese nationals. The Indonesian government, on the one hand, is obstructing our country's work of repatriating the affected overseas Chinese, and is limiting our consulates from performing their normal duties, making it impossible for our work of repatriating overseas Chinese to proceed smoothly; on the other hand, they are continuously expanding their anti-Chinese and expelling-Chinese activities. In many places in Indonesia, they are speeding up the unreasonable expulsion of overseas Chinese, depriving them of their livelihood, forcing tens of thousands of overseas Chinese out of their homes, pushing them to the brink of despair. We strongly protest against the Indonesian government's rampant anti-Chinese and expelling-Chinese activities. We must warn the Indonesian government that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with, and the nationals of powerful socialist China cannot be persecuted at will. The blood debt owed by the Indonesian reactionaries must be settled. If the Indonesian government does not stop its anti-Chinese and expelling-Chinese activities, we will resolutely fight to the end!

History has proven that the more people the reactionaries kill, the greater the revolutionary force becomes, and the closer the reactionaries are to their doom. No matter how rampant the Indonesian reactionaries may be for a time, they are actually nothing but paper tigers, and in the end, they will be exposed by the Indonesian people and receive the stern judgment of history. The 700 million Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, will forever stand on the side of the Indonesian people. We deeply sympathize with and care for the heavy disasters suffered by the Indonesian people. We firmly support the Indonesian people's just struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and the reactionaries of their own country, to achieve national independence, freedom, democracy, and liberation. We believe that the Indonesian people will further unite, break through all difficulties, and use resolute struggle to defeat all attacks by reactionary forces. The future of the Indonesian people is bright, and their revolutionary cause will definitely achieve final victory.

The right-wing military regime in Indonesia, in its domestic policies of anti-communism, anti-people, anti-progress, anti-national liberation, and anti-Chinese and expelling-Chinese, has received the support and approval of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique. They have been continuously shipping modern weapons into Indonesia, helping the right-wing military clique massacre communists, revolutionary people, and all patriotic democrats. They have been continuously conducting dirty political deals with the right-wing military regime in Indonesia through various channels. Countless facts tell people that wherever there is imperialist aggression, wherever there is the reactionaries massacring revolutionary people, the role of the Soviet revisionists as accomplices appears there. This once again exposes that the Soviet revisionist clique is a traitor to the revolutionary cause of the Indonesian people and the people of the world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said that the current situation in the world is one of the final struggle between the two great forces of revolution and counter-revolution. These two great forces have raised two great banners: one is the red banner of revolution, calling on all the oppressed classes of the world to rally under its banner; the other is the white banner of counter-revolution, calling on all counter-revolutionaries of the world to rally under its banner.

U.S. imperialism is desperately rallying various dark forces, struggling to the death. The Indonesian reactionaries are desperately aligning themselves with U.S. imperialism. The Soviet revisionist clique is desperately colluding with U.S. imperialism. This precisely shows that their days are getting harder. They are increasingly tearing off their masks, openly standing under the counter-revolutionary white banner of U.S. imperialism. Now, the lines of demarcation between revolution and counter-revolution in the world are becoming clearer. This is a great thing for the revolutionary people of the world.

The brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought is illuminating the world, lighting up the road to liberation for the people of various countries. We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. Currently, the struggle of the revolutionary people of the world against imperialism, the reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionism is in a great situation. The ranks of Marxism-Leninism are continuously expanding and growing stronger. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America and for national salvation is achieving one victory after another. The revolutionary movements of the people of various countries, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are thriving. In this vast region, the revolutionary people of more than 20 countries and regions have already or are currently taking up arms, engaging in life-and-death armed struggles with U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. A new revolutionary storm is rising in the world. The trend of imperialism heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism advancing towards global victory is absolutely unchangeable. The international proletariat and the revolutionary people of various countries, armed with and applying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, this most powerful weapon, will unite and fight, and will definitely win the whole world.

Comrades, our great leader Chairman Mao has summed up the practical experience of proletarian dictatorship and class struggle in our country and internationally, pointing out that throughout the very long historical period of socialism, there is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. The struggle between the two classes and the two roads is the principal contradiction in socialist society. If we do not remain highly vigilant and take necessary measures, there is the danger of the proletarian dictatorship degenerating into bourgeois dictatorship, the danger of capitalist restoration.

Currently, the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution is being carried out in our country, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. This cultural revolution is precisely to further consolidate our country's proletarian dictatorship and socialist system, prevent the revisionists from usurping leadership, and prevent capitalist restoration.

The main target of this proletarian cultural revolution is a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Their anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought criminal activities are in collusion with the class enemies at home and abroad. They are time bombs buried within our Party. Exposing them strikes a powerful blow against the counter-revolutionary revisionists' plot to restore capitalism and also uproots the base for imperialism and modern revisionism's attempt to carry out peaceful evolution and subversion in our country.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres are the main force of this cultural revolution. A large number of previously unknown revolutionary youth have become brave pioneers. The Red Guards are the vanguard of the proletarian cultural revolution, the bravest pioneers, and they have made outstanding contributions in the proletarian cultural revolution. Together with other revolutionary youth organizations, they have bravely and tenaciously fought against the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, against the bourgeois reactionary line, and against all the ghosts and monsters in society, charging into the fray, thoroughly criticizing the old and establishing the new, achieving brilliant victories, and creating immortal merits.

The proletarian cultural revolution is vigorously developing across the nation. It is powerfully promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking and further liberating the productive forces. The people of the entire nation, with Mao Zedong Thought as their guide, are implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction, seizing the revolution and promoting production, and using the sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm aroused in the cultural revolution in the struggles of industrial and agricultural production and scientific experiments, thereby making all work better, faster, and more economical. New leaps forward are emerging on all fronts across the nation. Yesterday, a new nuclear explosion was successfully conducted in our country's western region. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and another rich fruit of the proletarian cultural revolution.

Currently, the situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in our country is very good. The broad revolutionary masses have a better understanding of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, their direction of struggle is clearer, and their fighting spirit is more ardent. The broad masses are responding to Chairman Mao's call to care about state affairs, seriously thinking about the struggle between the two lines in the proletarian cultural revolution, and launching a mass criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line. Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the great proletarian cultural revolution is breaking through the obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line and is developing in a deeper and broader direction.

The broad masses of revolutionary overseas Chinese students, workers, and cadres, like the revolutionary masses across the nation, are responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, actively participating in this proletarian cultural revolution. They are fiercely attacking a handful of power-holders within the overseas affairs departments who are taking the capitalist road. The revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of overseas Chinese is very good. We hope that you will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, focus on politics, respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in your respective work or study units, carrying the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

The 41 youth have been tested and have overcome the persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries, and they are excellent. You are Red Guards without armbands. The Red Guards across the nation should learn from you, and you should also learn from the Red Guards at home. At the same time, you must realize that this is the first step of your great historical mission on the road of Mao Zedong Thought. You must remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "humility makes one progress, pride makes one fall behind," and you must be humble and avoid arrogance.

We hope that the 41 youth will actively participate in the proletarian cultural revolution, better master and apply Mao Zedong Thought, become good soldiers and students of Chairman Mao, be tempered and tested in the great waves of class struggle at home, make your thinking even redder, and make greater contributions to the socialist revolution and construction of our motherland; make greater contributions to supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.

Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live our most, most beloved leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years!

    在首都欢迎四十一名华侨青少年大会上
    陈毅副总理的讲话同志们：
    我们四十一名华侨青少年经过英勇斗争，终于挫败了印度尼西亚反动派的重重迫害和各种阴谋诡计，胜利地回到了伟大的社会主义祖国。现在，你们又来到我们祖国的心脏，来到我们伟大领袖毛主席的身边。我代表毛主席和他最亲密的战友林彪副主席，代表党中央和国务院，热烈地欢迎你们，并且向你们表示最亲切的慰问！
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的四十一名华侨青少年，在同印度尼西亚反动派的英勇斗争中所取得的光辉胜利，是毛泽东思想的又一曲凯歌。
    四十一名青少年是英雄的战斗集体。你们在印度尼西亚反动派的“收容所”和监狱里，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，遵循毛主席的教导去进行斗争。你们在残暴的法西斯军人的枪口和刺刀的威胁下，坚决维护社会主义祖国的尊严，充分表现了不畏强暴、不怕牺牲、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命英雄气概。你们的斗争和胜利，大大地灭了印度尼西亚反动派和帝国主义的反动气焰，长了海外爱国侨胞、中国人民和世界人民的革命志气。
    四十一名青少年的英雄事迹，为海外华侨树立了一个光辉的榜样，也为全国人民树立了光辉的榜样。我们应该向这些毛泽东时代的小英雄学习。
    毛泽东思想是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，是我们全党全国一切工作的指导方针，是全世界革命人民战胜帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义的最强大、最锐利的思想武器。
    现在全国人民正积极响应林彪副主席的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。广大华侨也要和全国人民一样，认真地、刻苦地大学毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，在国际阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪中，才能有坚定正确的政治方向和旺盛的斗争意志，才能具有压倒一切敌人而决不被敌人所屈服的大无畏的革命精神，向帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争。
    印度尼西亚右派军人集团，扮演着美帝国主义走卒的可耻角色，在印度尼西亚掀起了一股反革命的狂暴逆流。他们采取了灭绝人性的法西斯手段，大规模屠杀了印度尼西亚的革命群众，血洗了千岛之国。在右派军人集团的控制下，印度尼西亚政府为了迎合美帝国主义的需要，加紧推行反动政策。他们在疯狂地反共反人民的同时，也在变本加厉地进行反华排华活动，对华侨进行了残酷的迫害。印度尼西亚政府一方面百般阻挠我国接运受害华侨回国的工作，竭力限制我领事馆正常行使职务，使我国的接侨工作无法顺利进行；另一方面又在不断地扩大其反华排华活动。在印度尼西亚的许多地方，正在加紧对华侨进行无理迫迁，剥夺了华侨的生计，把数以万计的华侨赶出家门，推向绝路。对印度尼西亚政府猖狂的反华排华活动，我们提出最强烈的抗议。我们要正告印度尼西亚政府，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不可侮的，强大的社会主义中国的侨民绝不能任人迫害。印度尼西亚反动派欠下的血债一定要清算。印度尼西亚政府如果不停止反华排华活动，我们就要坚决和它斗争到底！
    历史证明，反动派杀人越多，革命的力量越大，反动派就越接近灭亡。不管印度尼西亚反动派如何猖狂一时，实际上它不过是一只纸老虎，到头来终将被印度尼西亚人民戳穿，受到历史的严正审判。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的七亿中国人民永远站在印度尼西亚人民一边。我们对印度尼西亚人民所遭受的深重灾难表示深切的关怀和同情。我们坚决支持印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义和本国反动派，争取祖国独立、自由、民主和解放的正义斗争。我们相信，印度尼西亚人民必将进一步团结起来，冲破重重困难，用坚决的斗争来击败反动势力的一切进攻。印度尼西亚人民的前途是光明的。他们的革命事业一定会取得最后胜利。
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权在国内实行的反共、反人民、反进步、反民族解放和反华排华政策，受到了苏联修正主义领导集团的支持和赏识。他们一直继续把现代化的武器运进印度尼西亚，帮助右派军人集团屠杀共产党人、革命人民和一切爱国民主人士。他们不断地通过各种途径，同印度尼西亚右派军人政权进行肮脏的政治交易。无数事实告诉人们，那里有帝国主义侵略，那里有反动派屠杀革命人民，苏联修正主义者帮凶的角色就在那里出现。这又一次暴露出：苏修集团是印度尼西亚人民和世界人民革命事业的叛徒。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说过，现在世界上的局面，是革命和反革命两大势力作最后斗争的局面。这两大势力竖起了两面大旗：一面是红色的革命的大旗，号召全世界一切被压迫阶级集合于其旗帜之下；一面是白色的反革命的大旗，号召全世界一切反革命分子集合于其旗帜之下。
    美帝国主义正在加紧纠合各种黑暗势力，拚命进行挣扎。印度尼西亚反动派加紧投靠美帝国主义。苏修集团同美帝国主义加紧勾结。这恰恰表明他们的日子都越来越难过。他们越来越撕开了假面具，公开站到美帝国主义的反革命的白旗下面。现在，世界上革命和反革命的界线划分得越来越清楚。这对于全世界革命人民说来，是一件大好事。
    伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉正在照耀着全世界，照亮着各国人民的解放道路。我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。当前全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义的斗争，呈现着一片大好形势。马克思列宁主义的队伍正在不断发展壮大。越南人民的抗美救国战争取得一个又一个的胜利。世界各国人民的革命运动，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命运动，正在蓬勃发展。在这个广大地带，有二十多个国家和地区的革命人民，已经或者正在拿起武器，同美帝国主义及其走狗展开你死我活的武装斗争。一个新的革命风暴正在全世界兴起。帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利，这个总趋势是绝对改变不了的。国际无产阶级和各国革命人民，掌握和运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想这个最强大的武器，团结战斗，一定能够赢得整个世界。
    同志们，我们伟大领袖毛主席总结了我国和国际的无产阶级专政和阶级斗争的实践经验，指出：在整个社会主义很长的历史时期，贯穿着无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，贯穿着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。两个阶级、两条道路的斗争是社会主义社会的主要矛盾。如果不引起高度警惕，不采取必要措施，也就存在着无产阶级专政蜕变为资产阶级专政的危险，存在着资本主义复辟的危险。
    目前，正在我国进行着的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的。这场文化大革命，正是为了进一步巩固我国的无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，防止修正主义篡夺领导，防止资本主义复辟。
    这场无产阶级文化大革命打击的重点，就是一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派。他们反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动，是同国内外阶级敌人相呼应的。他们是埋在我们党内的定时炸弹。把他们揪出来，就有力地打击了反革命修正主义分子实行资本主义复辟的阴谋，同时也就挖掉了帝国主义和现代修正主义妄图在我国搞和平演变和颠覆活动的根子。
    广大的工农兵、革命的知识分子和革命的干部，是这场文化大革命的主力军。一大批本来不出名的革命青少年，成了勇敢的闯将。红卫兵战士们是无产阶级文化大革命中的急先锋，是最勇敢的闯将，他们在无产阶级文化大革命中做出了卓越的贡献。他们和其他革命青少年组织一起，向党内走资本主义道路的当权派，向资产阶级反动路线，向社会上的一切牛鬼蛇神，进行了英勇顽强的斗争，冲锋陷阵，大破四旧，大立四新，取得了光辉的战果，创立了不朽的功勋。
    无产阶级文化大革命已经在全国蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。它正在有力地促进人的思想革命化，进一步解放社会生产力。全国人民以毛泽东思想为指针，贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，抓革命，促生产，把在文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天的革命干劲，用到工农业生产和科学实验的斗争中，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省，全国各个战线正在出现新的全面跃进的局面。昨天，在我国西部地区成功地进行了一次新的核爆炸。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕的成果。
    目前，我国无产阶级文化大革命的形势好得很。广大革命群众对于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线更加了解。他们的斗争方向更加明确，斗志更加昂扬。广大群众响应毛主席要关心国家大事的号召，认真思考无产阶级文化大革命中两条路线的斗争，对资产阶级反动路线展开了群众性的批判。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，冲破资产阶级反动路线的阻碍，正在向着更深入、更广阔的方面发展。
    广大归侨革命师生、职工和干部，同全国革命群众一样，响应党中央和毛主席的号召，积极投入了这场无产阶级文化大革命。他们猛烈地向各级侨务部门中一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开火。广大归侨革命群众的造反精神好得很。希望你们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，响应林彪副主席的号召，努力活学活用毛主席著作，坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，在各自的工作或学习的单位中完成一斗二批三改的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    四十一名青少年，经受了考验，战胜了印度尼西亚反动派的迫害，是好样的。你们是没有戴袖章的红卫兵。全国红卫兵要向你们学习，你们也要向国内红卫兵学习。同时，必须认识到这是你们在毛泽东思想的道路上，负起伟大历史使命的万里征途的第一步。你们要牢记毛主席关于“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，要戒骄戒躁。
    我们希望四十一名青少年积极投入无产阶级文化大革命，更好地掌握和运用毛泽东思想，做毛主席的好战士、好学生，在国内阶级斗争的大风大浪中，经受锻炼和考验，把思想炼得更红，为祖国的社会主义革命和建设事业，作出更大的贡献；为支援世界人民的革命斗争，作出更大的贡献。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
