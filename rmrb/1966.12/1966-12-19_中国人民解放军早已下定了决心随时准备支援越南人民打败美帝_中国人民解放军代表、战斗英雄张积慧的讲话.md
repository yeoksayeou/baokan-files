The Chinese People's Liberation Army has long resolved to support the Vietnamese people in defeating American imperialism at any time. This is a speech by Zhang Jihui, a representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and a battle hero.

Recently, American imperialism has repeatedly bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi. This is a serious provocation against the Vietnamese people and the people of the world! Today, I, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, strongly condemn and protest against American imperialism!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "American imperialism creates tension everywhere in the world to achieve its goal of aggression and enslavement of the people of various countries. American imperialism thinks that tension is always to its advantage, but the fact is that the tension created by the United States has turned against its wishes. It has served to mobilize the people of the world to oppose the American aggressors." This is exactly the case. The American bandits fully intended to use this bombing as part of their conspiracy to "bomb and force" in collusion with the Soviet Union, but their bombing has only further enraged the 31 million Vietnamese people, strengthening their resolve to resist American aggression and save their country. The American imperialists' conspiracy has once again been thoroughly smashed! The American bandits' bombing of Hanoi is just another ugly performance of a paper tiger in front of the Vietnamese and world peoples! Blood debts must be repaid with blood. The heroic Vietnamese people will surely give the American bandits a double dose of severe punishment!

While American imperialism was madly bombing Hanoi, it brazenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, once again making a serious war provocation against the Chinese people. This further infuriates us! American imperialism thinks that by such hooligan behavior, it can force the Chinese people to abandon their support for the Vietnamese people, which is nothing but a pipe dream! The Chinese people are a great people armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They are a great people who dare to take on any risks and make any sacrifices. They are a great people who will not be intimidated by any war threats. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have long resolved to be ready at any time to join the heroic Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors until all American bandits are driven out of Vietnam! We warn American imperialism: you are defeated soldiers under the hands of the Chinese people. If you insist on imposing war on the Chinese people, it will be your own doing, lifting a rock to drop on your own feet! You will have no good end!

Comrades and friends: On this solemn occasion, we are also filled with great joy and excitement to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Over the past six years, the people of South Vietnam have fought bravely and achieved brilliant victories, making the people's war shine brightly, boosting the morale of the people, and crushing the arrogance of the American bandits. They have set a brilliant example for the world people's anti-American struggle. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is determined to fully support you and learn from you humbly. We will definitely defeat our common enemy, American imperialism, thoroughly! Finally, let us shout:

Down with American imperialism!
Victory to the Vietnamese people!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times, ten thousand ten thousand times!

    中国人民解放军早已下定了决心随时准备支援越南人民打败美帝
    中国人民解放军代表、战斗英雄张积慧的讲话
    美帝国主义最近接二连三地轰炸越南民主共和国的首都河内，这是对越南人民和世界人民的严重挑衅！今天，我代表中国人民解放军的全体指战员，对美帝国主义进行强烈的谴责和抗议！
    毛主席教导我们：“美帝国主义在全世界到处制造紧张局势，以期达到它侵略和奴役各国人民的目的。美帝国主义自以为紧张局势总是对它自己有利，但是事实是，美国制造的这些紧张局势走向了美国人愿望的反面，它起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用。”事情正是这样，美国强盗满心想把这次轰炸作为它推行美苏合搞的“以炸迫和”阴谋的一个组成部分，但是，它的轰炸更加激起了三千一百万越南人民的无比的愤怒和坚持抗美救国的决心。美帝国主义的阴谋，又一次被彻底粉碎！美国强盗这次轰炸河内，不过是在越南和世界人民面前又作了一次纸老虎的丑恶表演！血债要用血来还，英雄的越南人民必定会加倍地给予美国强盗以严厉的惩罚！
    美帝国主义在疯狂地轰炸河内时，还悍然轰炸了我国驻越南民主共和国大使馆，再一次向中国人民进行严重的战争挑衅，这更激起我们无比的愤怒！美帝国主义企图用这种流氓行为，迫使中国人民放弃对越南人民的支援，完全是白日作梦！中国人民是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大人民，是敢于承担任何风险，不怕任何牺牲的伟大人民，是任何战争恫吓都吓不倒的伟大人民。中国人民和中国人民解放军早已下定决心，随时准备和英雄的越南人民一起，彻底打败美国侵略者，直到把美国强盗全部赶出越南！我们要警告美帝国主义：你们是中国人民手下的败将。如果你们硬要把战争强加在中国人民头上，那是你们“自作孽不可活”，自己搬起石头砸自己的脚！你们绝对没有好下场！
    同志们，朋友们：在今天这个庄严的大会上，我们还以十分欢欣鼓舞的心情，庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年。六年来，越南南方人民越战越强，取得辉煌胜利，使人民战争大放异彩，长了人民的志气，灭了美国强盗的威风，为世界人民反美斗争树立了光辉的典范。中国人民解放军决心全力支援你们，并虚心向你们学习，一定要把我们共同的敌人美帝国主义彻底打败！最后，让我们高呼：
    美帝国主义必败！越南人民必胜！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！
