The impoverished herdsmen of Dong Ujimqin Banner's Samai Commune in Inner Mongolia hold boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao. They regard studying Chairman Mao's works as their primary need in life.

Every yurt in the entire commune has a portrait of Chairman Mao, his works, and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Each herding group has established a study group for Chairman Mao's works, each production brigade has a study guidance group, and each study group has a "study garden." During the day, on the vast grasslands, one can see herdsmen holding the bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and studying; in the evenings, one can hear the voices of reading and discussing Chairman Mao's works from the yurts. Herdsman Urenchimuge said, "Chairman Mao's words hit the spot for us poor herdsmen. The more we listen to Chairman Mao's words, the clearer our minds become, and the more energetic we feel." Elderly people like Ardihede and Boerjige often tell the young people: "If it comes to running, we can't keep up with you young people; but in studying Chairman Mao's works and listening to Chairman Mao's words, we will not fall behind!"

Last winter and this spring, the commune faced a series of snowstorms; in the summer, it encountered prolonged drought and livestock diseases. In the face of these disasters, each production brigade's herdsmen first repeatedly studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles." Chairman Mao said, "Our comrades must see achievements and light in the face of difficulties, and raise our morale." "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." These teachings greatly boosted the herdsmen's confidence and resolve to overcome the disasters. In a blizzard, herdsman Bater lost his way while herding sheep. At that moment, he was cold, tired, and hungry. When he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, "No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight," he immediately regained his spirit and followed the sheep closely. Later, his wife also caught up, and the couple fought through the blizzard for two days and a night, ensuring that the collective's sheep were not harmed.

    毛主席的话句句说到牧民心坎上
    内蒙古东乌珠穆沁旗沙麦公社的贫苦牧民，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的深厚阶级感情，把学习毛主席著作当成了生活第一需要。
    全公社的每个蒙古包里，都有毛主席像、毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》。每个放牧组都成立有毛主席著作学习小组，每个生产队都有学习辅导组，每个学习小组还设有“学习园地”。白天，在广阔的草原上，可以看到放牧员手捧着鲜红的《毛主席语录》在学习；晚间，可以听到蒙古包里朗读和讨论毛主席著作的声音。牧民乌仁其木格说：“毛主席他老人家的话，句句说到咱贫苦牧民的心坎上。越听毛主席的话，心里越亮堂，劲头也越足。”阿尔迪希德和博日额吉等老人，经常对年轻人说：要是跑，我们跑不过你们年轻人；可学习毛主席著作、听毛主席的话，我们决不让你们拉下！
    去冬今春，这个公社遭到了一连串的风雪袭击；夏季，又遇到了长期的干旱和牲畜疾病。在灾害面前，各生产队的牧民首先反复学习了“老三篇”。毛主席说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这些教导，大大提高了社员战胜灾害的信心和决心。在一次暴风雪中，牧民巴特尔放羊迷失了方向。这时他又冷又累又饿。当他想到毛主席的教导：“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去”时，立刻振作起精神，紧紧跟着羊群跑去。后来，他爱人也跟了上来，夫妻俩跟着羊群在暴风雪中搏斗了两天一夜，终于保证了集体的羊群没受损失。
