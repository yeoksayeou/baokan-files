The advanced unit in Shandong Province, following the Dazhai model, the Daxia Village Production Brigade of Lujia Commune in Huang County, has seen a new situation and a new level in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The villagers and many children around the age of ten in this brigade study Chairman Mao's works and quotations wherever they are, whether in the fields, at the construction sites, in schools, or on their kangs (traditional Chinese beds).

Now, most villagers not only have the images of Zhang Zedong, White Furong, and the Old Man of the Mountain deeply imprinted in their minds, but they also memorize many commonly used quotations from Chairman Mao. Everyone takes Chairman Mao's quotations as their guide to action and regards the "three people" as their role models. The atmosphere of selflessness and love for the collective has become even stronger, and good deeds are constantly emerging.

During the autumn, the brigade was building a middle school in Xiaobei Valley. One night, it suddenly rained, and the seven households in Xiaobei Village all spontaneously brought out their mats and quilts to cover the unfinished building, thus protecting the public property in time.

There is a villager named Lü Wenkuang in Kouzi Village. In the past, he was lazy and avoided heavy work, and some villagers called him "points crazy." After studying Chairman Mao's works, he abandoned the "self" and devoted himself to the collective, actively participating in collective production labor. Now, everyone unanimously calls him "collective crazy."

In various production teams, such incidents often occur: when there is a shortage of sand at the water conservancy construction site, someone would bring a lot of sand overnight; an urgent task proposed the previous night would be quietly completed by someone the next morning.

People change, land changes, and production changes. The power of Mao Zedong Thought is boundless. This year, despite the severe natural disasters, the average yield per mu in Daxia Village reached 1,025 jin. Oil crops and fruits also saw a significant increase in production. This is the best harvest the village has ever had. The villagers say, "This is because we all 'obediently follow Chairman Mao's command.'"

Villagers Sing Quotations Songs

The villagers of Xinhua Commune in Qingtongxia County, Ningxia, have enthusiastically launched a movement to study Chairman Mao's thoughts and sing quotations songs, and the enthusiastic quotations songs can be heard everywhere.

Recently, at a villagers' meeting held in Xinhua Commune, an old women's choir performed the quotations song "Strive for Victory" and the revolutionary song "The Ship of the Sea Depends on the Helm" and others. This choir is composed of nine women aged between 45 and 60. They are illiterate, but they love Chairman Mao and his works and are determined to remember Chairman Mao's words in their hearts. Therefore, they organized this choir to learn quotations songs from the young people. At first, someone laughed at them, saying, "Old people have short breath, teeth fall out, and even speaking is difficult, how can they sing?" However, they did not give up and finally learned many quotations songs. They said: "We suffered for half of our lives in the old society. When we were girls, we never sang songs. Now that we are old, we still sing songs, all because Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have liberated us. We must read Chairman Mao's books and follow Chairman Mao's words even better."

Every Quotation is a Mobilization Order

"One quotation is a mobilization order!" During the busy autumn harvest season, the cadres and villagers of Liangpu Production Brigade in Liangcun Commune, Hua'an County, Fujian, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out a thorough ideological revolution, and make the autumn harvest work proceed quickly and smoothly.

During the busy autumn harvest season, the villagers wrote Chairman Mao's quotations everywhere in the brigade, inside and outside the houses, at the village entrances, on the roadsides, and in the fields. Everyone looks at them, studies them, and uses them all the time. In the Hu Xing Production Team, some female villagers used to let their chickens and ducks into the collective fields to eat grain during the harvest. Before this autumn harvest, the team cadres organized them to study the "Three Articles," and placed quotation boards at the entrances and fields for everyone to study at any time. One day, the female villager Fang Xieguang was about to let her chickens and ducks into the collective field to eat grain when she saw the quotation board at the field's edge. She thought: Comrade White Furong is a foreigner who crossed the ocean to help the Chinese people make a revolution and sacrificed his precious life; I, on the other hand, only think of myself. Thinking of this, she quickly put the chickens and ducks back in and led five female villagers to the mountain to cut bamboo poles, fencing the field at the entrance. The Puwei Production Team's late-season rice this year is all short-stemmed varieties, making threshing more difficult. The villager Huang Fuyou initially was afraid of hurting his hands on the rice stalks and did not dare to thresh heavily, resulting in very dirty threshing. When he saw the quotation from Chairman Mao on the rice stalks, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," he felt full of energy and threshed very cleanly.

The villagers all happily said: "Quotation boards are hung everywhere, revolutionary truths are carved in the heart, every word and sentence shines with gold, every word and sentence is powerful, guiding us forward, firing at the 'self,' forever revolutionary, always following the Party."

    沿着毛泽东思想轨道不断前进
    山东省的大寨式先进单位、黄县大吕家公社下丁家大队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，出现了一个新的局面，提高到了一个新的水平。
    这个大队的社员和许多十岁左右的儿童，无论在田野里，在工地上，在学校里，在炕头上，都随时随地学习毛主席著作和毛主席语录。
    现在，多数社员，不但脑子里深深印下了张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个人的形象，而且熟记着很多条常用的毛主席语录。人人把毛主席语录作为自己行动的指南，把“三个人”作为自己做人的榜样，一心为公、热爱集体的空气更加浓厚了，好人好事不断涌现。
    秋季，大队在小北夼修建农业中学校舍。一天夜里忽然下了雨，小北夼村的七户社员，都不约而同地把自己家里的席子、毯子拿出来，盖在还没有完工的房子上，及时保护了公共财产。
    口子村有个社员叫吕文广，过去干活拈轻怕重，有的社员叫他“工分迷”。学习毛主席著作以后，他丢掉“私”字，一心为公，积极参加集体生产劳动。现在，大家一致称他为“集体迷”。
    各生产队常常发生这样的事情：当水利工地上沙子不足的时候，一夜之间，不知谁又挑来了很多沙子；头一天夜晚提出的紧急任务，第二天一早便有人悄悄地把它完成了。
    人变，地变，产量变，毛泽东思想威力大无边。今年，下丁家大队自然灾害比较严重，但是，粮食平均亩产量却达到了一千零二点五斤。油料、水果也获得了大幅度增产。这是这个大队空前的好收成。社员们说，这是因为我们大家都“老老实实地听毛主席的指挥。”
    社员高唱语录歌
    宁夏青铜峡县新华公社的社员，热烈开展了学毛主席思想、唱毛主席语录歌的活动，到处都可以听到热情洋溢的语录歌声。
    最近，在新华公社举行的一次社员大会上，一个老大娘合唱队演唱了《争取胜利》语录歌和《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌曲。这个合唱队是由九位四十五岁到六十岁的妇女组成的。她们都不识字，但是她们热爱毛主席，热爱毛主席著作，决心把毛主席的话牢牢地记在心里。于是她们组织了这个合唱队，向青年人学唱毛主席语录歌。开始有人笑她们说：“人老了，气短了，牙掉了，说话都走风，还能唱歌？”但是她们不灰心，终于学会了很多首毛主席语录歌。她们说：咱们在旧社会受了半辈子苦，当女娃娃时也没有唱过歌。现在年纪大了还唱歌，完全是因为毛主席、共产党领导咱们翻了身，咱们就要读毛主席的书，更好地听毛主席的话。
    条条语录都是动员令
    “一条语录就是一道动员令！”福建华安县良村公社良埔大队的干部社员在秋收大忙季节，努力活学活用毛主席著作，大搞人的思想革命化，使秋收工作进行得又快又好。
    在秋收大忙时，社员们在全大队的厝内厝外，村里路口，路边田头，都写上了毛主席语录。大家时时看，时时学，时时用。虎形生产队有的女社员，过去每到收割时就把自己家里的鸡鸭放到集体田里去吃谷子。今年秋收前，队里干部组织她们学习了“老三篇”，并在门口田边插上了毛主席语录牌，便于大家随时学习。一天，女社员方谢榴刚想放鸡鸭到集体田里吃谷子，一眼看到田边上插的语录牌，她想：白求恩同志是一个外国人，漂洋过海，帮助中国人民闹革命，献出了自己宝贵的生命；我呢，却专为自己打算。想到这里，她赶快把鸡鸭关起来，并带领五个女社员上山砍竹竿，把门口的田围上了篱笆。埔尾生产队今年晚稻都是矮秆品种，打谷比较困难。社员黄福有开始时怕手碰上谷楻，不敢重打，脱粒很不干净。当他看到谷楻上写的毛主席语录“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”时，便觉得浑身是劲，打谷时打得很干净。
    社员们都高兴地说：“语录牌，处处挂，革命真理刻心上，字字句句闪金光，字字句句力量大，指引我们向前进，向着‘我’字猛开火，永远革命永向党。”
