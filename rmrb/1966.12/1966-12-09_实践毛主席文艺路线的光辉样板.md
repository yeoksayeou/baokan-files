Chairman Mao said: History is created by the people, but on the old stage (in all literature and art that is divorced from the people), the people are reduced to mere dregs, while the stage is dominated by masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being corrected by you, restoring history's true face. From now on, old dramas have a new look, and this is worth celebrating. A certain unit of the PLA, Shi Peishi, said:

The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Sha Jianhu" has successfully emphasized politics and held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a brilliant achievement in firmly implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought. The birth of "Sha Jianhu" and other revolutionary model operas is a great victory for Chairman Mao's line on literature and art in the struggle against the bourgeois and revisionist line on literature and art represented by Zhou Yang!

The most successful aspect of the revision of "Sha Jianhu" is that it is permeated throughout with Chairman Mao's military thought. It vividly embodies Chairman Mao's ideas of "without a people's army, there is nothing for the people" and "revolutionary war is the people's war," thus elevating and deepening the theme. The characters are more complete and towering, the plot and content are more reasonable, and therefore more moving and educational.

	*	*	* A worker from Henan said:

We have seen ballet performances before and listened to some ballet music excerpts, but we have never been as moved as when we listened to the music excerpts from the ballet "Red Detachment of Women." Some worker comrades said after listening, "Red Detachment of Women" is great, ballet can also be revolutionized, this is unprecedented! This is the great Mao Zedong Thought reforming the ballet. After listening to the broadcast, I wrote these two lines in my diary:

	Hearing the ballet "Red Detachment of Women," I am determined to be a red successor.
	If I have the chance to see the performance in person, I don't know what words I will use to praise it! But we all think:

	Thousands of words, Chairman Mao's words are the most important,
	Thousands of principles, Mao Zedong Thought is the first and foremost.
	In the end, the reason ballet can be revolutionized is that Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought is in command!

	We need and welcome such revolutionary ballets very much. We hope to create more works like "Red Detachment of Women" to inspire and encourage us to carry the socialist revolution through to the end!

	*	*	* Ke Xingyi from Shanghai said:

The slogan of reforming Beijing opera has been raised for many years since liberation. However, it encountered various obstacles. The remnants of the feudal class opposed it, bourgeois artists opposed it, and the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Zhou Yang was even more deceitful and obstructed it in every way. Therefore, for a long time, there was actually no progress. After seeing the plays "Red Lantern," "Sha Jianhu," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Harbor," and "Ambush on White Tiger Mountain," I feel that they are truly reformed! Truly a great revolution! They have swept the emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties into the trash can and made workers, peasants, and soldiers the masters of the Beijing opera stage. These plays powerfully prove that as long as we adhere to the great Mao Zedong Thought and follow Chairman Mao's line on literature and art, any difficulty can be overcome, just as these model operas have done. In this way, Beijing opera can truly serve socialism.

	*	*	* Yang Shanzhong, a member from Hebei, said:

We listened to the ballet "Red Detachment of Women." I think this play is very good. This is the preliminary achievement of our young dancers, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, combining with the workers and peasants, and carrying out the socialist revolution. It is also a new victory for the dance work to implement the policy of revolutionization, nationalization, and popularization. I hope that the drama workers and all the performers will continue their efforts, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive for new victories for the new literature and art of the proletariat.

	*	*	* Liu Huaming, a worker from Beijing, said:

The symphony "Sha Jianhu" expresses Chairman Mao's great thoughts. It was completed in a month, which is a revolutionary innovation under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Literature and art should face the workers, peasants, and soldiers. I think that after the reform, the symphony is a very good form of serving proletarian politics. Today, after listening to it, I will also tell my comrades about the revolutionary spirit of this play and carry this spirit into our production to do our work better.

	*	*	* A commune member from Shanghai said:

I had the opportunity to see the large-scale ballet "White-Haired Girl," and I was both happy and excited. I am a young person from a poor peasant family and have never seen a ballet before. I heard that it only performs stories of foreign emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, and that we laboring people have no place on the stage. However, revolutionary literary and artistic workers have implemented Chairman Mao's direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and brought the revolutionary struggle stories of us poor and lower-middle peasants onto the stage. This is the achievement of the revolutionization of ballet art.

The ballet "White-Haired Girl" depicts the miserable plight of our laboring people in the old society and their tenacious struggle against the landlord class. The performers acted vividly and were full of class feelings, greatly boosting the revolutionary spirit of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

Some people say that ballet cannot express the revolutionary struggle of the laboring people. The performance of "White-Haired Girl" proves that this saying is wrong. After seeing the play, I deeply felt that this is the victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. I hope that my comrades in the ballet will achieve greater successes under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought!

Editor's Note: Since 1964, under the shining guidance of Chairman Mao's line on literature and art, a high tide of revolutionary reforms in Beijing opera, ballet, and symphonic music has risen, creating revolutionary model operas such as "Sha Jianhu," "Red Lantern," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Harbor," "Ambush on White Tiger Mountain," the ballet "Red Detachment of Women," "White-Haired Girl," and the symphony "Sha Jianhu."

The birth of these revolutionary model operas is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great innovation in the history of proletarian literature and art. These achievements were made by breaking through the heavy obstacles and suppression of the anti-party and anti-socialist leadership of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, former Propaganda Department, and former Ministry of Culture. In this serious class struggle, Comrade Jiang Qing held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and made special contributions.

The birth of these revolutionary model operas is a heavy blow to the decaying feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism in literature and art, and a great shock to the old world. Under the influence and leadership of these revolutionary model operas, a batch of new revolutionary literary and artistic works have been produced, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have taken the stage.

This new literature and art of the proletariat has unprecedentedly attracted the revolutionary masses. They enthusiastically support it with both hands. Because these model operas are created for them and used by them. Because these model operas can raise their awareness and inspire their fighting spirit. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals cannot suppress their excitement and express their enthusiastic support and deep love for the revolutionary model operas in various forms. What is published here is a summary of some of the letters written by the masses.

### 实践毛主席文艺路线的光辉样板

    实践毛主席文艺路线的光辉样板
    毛主席说：历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目，从此旧剧开了新生面，所以值得庆贺。解放军某部施丕石说：
    革命现代京剧《沙家浜》做到了突出政治，高高举起了毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。这是坚决贯彻毛主席文艺思想所取得的辉煌战果。《沙家浜》和其他革命样板戏的诞生，是毛主席文艺路线对以周扬为代表的资产阶级、修正主义文艺路线进行斗争的伟大胜利！
    《沙家浜》修改得最成功之处，就是从头到尾贯穿了毛主席的军事思想，它形象地体现了毛主席关于“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”和“革命战争是群众的战争”的思想，从而提高和深化了主题思想。人物塑造也更完整、更高大，情节内容更合情合理，因而也就更感人，教育意义更大。
                          ＊　＊　＊河南一位工人说：
    我们过去看过芭蕾舞演出，也听过一些芭蕾舞音乐片断，但从来没有像我们听芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的音乐片断那么激动过。有的工人同志听了说，《红色娘子军》太好了，芭蕾舞也能革命化，这是开天辟地第一遭呢！这是伟大的毛泽东思想改革了芭蕾舞剧。听完播音后，我在日记里写了这么两句话：
        喜听芭蕾《红色娘子军》，
        誓做红色接班人。
    如果将来有机会亲眼看一次演出，真不知会用什么语言来赞扬呢！但我们都认为：
          千言万语，毛主席的话最重要，
        千条万条，毛泽东思想挂帅第一条！
    说到头，芭蕾能革命化，最根本一条，就是毛泽东文艺思想挂帅啦！
    我们太需要和欢迎这样革命的芭蕾舞剧了。我们希望多创造一些像《红色娘子军》这样的剧目，来激励我们，鼓舞我们，把社会主义革命进行到底！
                          ＊　＊　＊上海柯兴一说：
    京剧改革这句口号，解放以来提了不少年。但是它遇到了种种障碍。封建阶级的遗老遗少反对它，资产阶级文艺家反对它，周扬反革命修正主义集团更是阳奉阴违，百般阻挠。所以在过去很长一段时间，实际上没有进展。看了《红灯记》《沙家浜》《智取威虎山》《海港》和《奇袭白虎团》这些戏以后，我觉得真是改得好！真是大革命！它们把帝王将相、才子佳人扫进垃圾箱，让工农兵成为京剧舞台的主人。这些戏有力地证明：只要以伟大的毛泽东思想挂帅，坚持毛主席文艺路线，任何困难都能克服，就像这些样板戏已经做到的那样。这样，京剧才能真正为社会主义服务。
                        ＊　＊　＊河北社员杨善忠说：
    我们收听了芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》。我认为这个剧很好，这确是我国年轻的舞蹈工作者在毛主席文艺思想指引下，与工农群众相结合，进行社会主义革命所取得的初步成果，也是舞蹈工作执行革命化民族化群众化方针的一次新胜利。希望舞剧工作人员和全体演员们再接再厉，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为无产阶级新文艺的新胜利而奋斗。
                        ＊　＊　＊北京工人刘华明说：
    交响音乐《沙家浜》表现了毛主席的伟大思想。用一个月搞出来，是毛泽东思想指导下的一个革命的创举。文艺应该面向工农兵。交响音乐经过改造，我认为这是为无产阶级政治服务的一个很好的形式。今天听完了，我还要和同志们讲讲这出戏的革命精神，把这种精神也贯彻到我们的生产上去，把工作搞得更好。
                          ＊　＊　＊上海一位公社社员说：
    我有机会看到大型芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，又高兴又激动。我是一个贫农出身的青年，从来没有看过芭蕾舞，听人说它演的都是外国的帝王将相、才子佳人，我们劳动人民在舞台上是没有地位的。但是，革命的文艺工作者们，贯彻了毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，把我们贫下中农的革命斗争故事搬上了舞台，这是芭蕾舞艺术革命化的收获。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，表现了我们劳动人民在旧社会里的悲惨遭遇和对地主阶级进行的顽强斗争，演员们演得又生动，又充满了阶级感情，大长了我们贫下中农的革命志气。
    有人说，芭蕾舞不能表现劳动人民的革命斗争，《白毛女》的演出证明了这种说法是不对的。看过戏以后，我深深体会到：这是毛泽东文艺思想的胜利。希望从事芭蕾舞的同志们，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，作出更大的成绩！
    编者按：一九六四年以来，在毛主席文艺路线的光辉照耀下，兴起了京剧、芭蕾舞剧和交响音乐等革命改革的高潮，创造了京剧《沙家浜》、《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《奇袭白虎团》，芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，交响音乐《沙家浜》等等革命样板戏。
    这些革命样板戏的诞生，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文艺史上的伟大创举。这些成就是冲破了旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部反党反社会主义领导的重重阻挠和种种压制取得的。在这场严重的阶级斗争中，江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，做出了特殊的贡献。
    这些革命样板戏的诞生，对腐朽没落的封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的文艺，是个沉重的打击，对旧世界是个极大的震动。在这些革命样板戏的影响和带动下，已经产生了一批新的革命的文艺作品，广大工农兵登上了戏剧舞台。
    这种无产阶级的新文艺，空前地吸引了革命群众。他们举双手热烈赞成。因为这些样板戏为他们所作，为他们所用。因为这些样板戏能提高他们的觉悟，鼓舞他们的斗志。广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子，抑制不住内心的激动，以各种形式表达他们对革命样板戏热烈支持、万分喜爱的心情。这里发表的，是部分群众所写的信稿的摘要。
