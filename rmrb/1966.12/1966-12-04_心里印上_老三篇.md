Chairman Mao's thoughts arm me,
"The Three Constantly Read Articles" are engraved in my heart.
Pulling the "Taihang" feels effortless,
The hoe against "Wangwu" is but a trifle.
Glue-like mud and flowing sand are no obstacles,
Enduring hardship and toiling willingly,
Chairman Mao's call is remembered in my heart,
Fighting against the heavens and the earth with boundless enthusiasm.

    心里印上“老三篇”
    高海毛主席思想武装俺，心里印上“老三篇”。车拉“太行”不觉累，锨端“王屋”只等闲。胶泥流沙难不住，吃苦耐劳心情愿，毛主席号召心里记，战天斗地干劲冲天。
