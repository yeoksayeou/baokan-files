On December 26th, many bookstores in the capital once again sold a large batch of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Amidst the sounds of firecrackers and drums, people held up the revolutionary treasure, jumping and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The intense love for Chairman Mao in everyone's hearts dispelled the chill of temperatures below zero. Many people started queuing at the bookstores from the night of the 25th, singing "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman" and reciting the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" over and over, welcoming the rising sun. Five hundred thousand copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" were sold out in just over an hour. By this point, during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the capital had distributed a total of 1.5 million copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

Some workers came to the Xinhua Bookstore on Chaoyang Street early in the morning, filled with class feelings of boundless love for Chairman Mao, each buying a set of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Some of these workers had just finished their night shift, while others hadn't even taken off their work clothes. They said: "Treasure book, treasure book! We workers have been longing for you day and night. We can't revolutionize without reading Chairman Mao's books!" A young worker, after buying the treasure book, solemnly held it to his chest. He excitedly said: "I will study it for life and use it to guide our actions. I will definitely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study the 'Three Articles' as a motto, open up a battlefield in my mind, launch a fierce attack on the 'self,' and use 'public' to defeat 'self,' striving to become a new communist person armed with Mao Zedong Thought."

Some workers, after buying the treasure book, wrote on the red wrapping paper with deep affection: "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" The workers said: "We can buy the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' today, this is the greatest joy, this is the greatest happiness. We will swear to Chairman Mao: we will follow your teachings, seize the revolution and promote production. In the fiery Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we dare to charge forward, walk the path that no one has walked before, and blaze a new trail to communism. In production struggles and scientific experiments, we dare to climb the peaks that no one has climbed before, and contribute to the socialist construction of our motherland."

A group of guards who protect Chairman Mao, just off duty, rushed to the Xinhua Bookstore without washing their faces or eating. After getting the treasure book, they excitedly said: "The guards of Chairman Mao must listen to Chairman Mao's words, tightly grip the gun in our hands, stand guard for life, serve the people for life, and protect Chairman Mao for life."

A soldier from a certain island in Shandong, who was on a business trip to Beijing, rushed to the Xinhua Bookstore's front door store in the few hours before leaving Beijing to buy a set of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" for his unit. Holding the revolutionary treasure book, he excitedly said: "Chairman Mao is the reddest sun in our hearts. With Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, we have everything! I will take Chairman Mao's book back to the island and study it with my comrades every day, using it in practice, and responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage with actual actions."

Among the people who joyfully received the treasure book, there were many revolutionary cultural workers from all over the country who came to Beijing for revolutionary exchanges. A Sichuan opera performer from Chengdu, after obtaining a set of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," was overjoyed. She held the book tightly to her chest, excitedly saying: "I will forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming a true proletarian revolutionary cultural warrior, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving proletarian politics. We will resolutely and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

A group of young Long Marchers from Shandong, upon hearing that the Xinhua Bookstore was selling the treasure book, took dry rations from the canteen the night before and rushed from their living quarters in the eastern suburbs to the city's Xinhua Bookstore. While waiting in the cold wind, they recited Chairman Mao's quotations. They said, "Although the weather is very cold, thinking about obtaining the treasure book makes our hearts infinitely warm!" When they got the treasure book wrapped in red paper, they happily said: "With Chairman Mao's book, we have a direction for revolution. Chairman Mao's book is air, food, and a steering wheel. In the future, we will never be separated from Chairman Mao's thoughts, always reading Chairman Mao's book."

Seven members of a Long March team from Shaanxi, after each obtaining a set of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," excitedly gathered together and had a heated discussion. A female team member excitedly said: "Although Beijing's weather is very cold, our hearts are always burning hot because we have the reddest sun in our hearts." A male team member, holding the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in both hands, said: "We obtained the treasure book for revolution by Chairman Mao's side, which is a significant event for our lives." Another male team member added: "In the future, we will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, revolutionize according to Chairman Mao's teachings, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and make our iron-clad socialist state never change color!"

Several revolutionary young warriors from the "Red Female Soldiers Long March Team" from Tianjin, each holding a new set of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," excitedly shouted: "We all have a red book, we all have it!" In three days, they will hoist the red flag, carry the revolutionary treasure book, and set off on the journey to the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an. They said: "On the Long March, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought. We will follow Chairman Mao closely, read Chairman Mao's books for life, walk the revolutionary path for life, reform our thoughts for life, and serve the people for life!"

    最大的喜事　最大的幸福
    ——记十二月二十六日首都万千革命群众喜得《毛泽东选集》
    十二月二十六日，首都许多新华书店门市部又一次大批发行《毛泽东选集》。在鞭炮声、锣鼓声中，人们高举着革命宝书，跳跃欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    一颗颗无限热爱毛主席的火热红心，驱散了零下十多度的严寒。许多人从二十五日深夜起就赶到书店等候，在那里一遍又一遍高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，诵读《毛主席语录》，迎来了东方旭日。五万套《毛泽东选集》，在一个多小时内就发行完了。至此，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，首都先后发行了一百五十万套《毛泽东选集》。
    一些工人一大早来到新华书店朝外大街门市部，满怀对毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，每人买了一套《毛泽东选集》。这些工人有的刚刚下了夜班，有的连工作服还未脱下就来了。他们说：宝书呀，宝书！我们工人日夜都想得到你，干革命不读毛主席的书不行呀！一个青年工人买到宝书后，端庄地把它托在胸前。他激动地说：“我要一辈子学习它，用它来指导我们的行动。我一定响应林彪同志的号召，把‘老三篇’当作座右铭来学，在自己的头脑里开辟一个战场，向‘私’字猛烈开火，用‘公’字把‘私’字打倒，努力做一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产主义新人。”
    有的工人买到宝书后，在包书的红纸上满怀深情地写上：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”工人们说：我们能在今天买到《毛泽东选集》，这是最大的喜事，这是最大的幸福。我们要向毛主席宣誓：我们按照您的教导，抓革命促生产。在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，敢于冲锋陷阵，走前人未走过的道路，为通向共产主义闯出一条崭新的道路来。在生产斗争和科学实验中，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰，为祖国的社会主义建设作出贡献。
    守卫在毛主席身边的一批警卫战士，刚刚下哨，顾不上洗脸、吃饭，就跑到了新华书店门市部。当他们拿到宝书以后，兴奋地说：毛主席的警卫战士，一定要听毛主席的话，紧握手中枪，站一辈子岗，为人民服务一辈子，一辈子保卫毛主席。
    一位出差来京的山东某海岛的解放军战士，抓紧离京前的几个钟头，赶到新华书店前门门市部给班里买了《毛泽东选集》。他捧着革命宝书激动地说：毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。有了毛主席，有了毛泽东思想，才有我们的一切！我把毛主席的书带回海岛，要同战友们一道天天读，天天用，活学活用，以实际行动响应林彪同志的把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段的号召。
    在喜得宝书的人们中，有许多是全国各地来京串连的革命文艺工作者。来自成都的一个川剧演员得到一套《毛泽东选集》，万分欣喜。她双手把书紧紧捧着贴在胸前，激动地说：我要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，作一个真正的无产阶级的革命的文艺战士，为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务。我们要坚决彻底粉碎反革命修正主义文艺路线，完成一斗二批三改的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    来自山东的一支长征队小将们，听说新华书店出售宝书，头天晚上就在食堂取了干粮，从东郊住地赶到城区新华书店门前。他们一边在寒风中等候，一边背诵毛主席语录。他们说，虽然天气很冷，但是想到可以得到宝书，心里就无限温暖！当他们拿到了用红纸包装的宝书时，高兴地说：有了毛主席的书，我们干革命就有了方向。毛主席的书是空气，是粮食，是方向盘。今后，我们一定做到一刻也不离开毛主席的思想，时时都读毛主席的书。
    来自陕西的一个长征队的七名队员，每人得到一套《毛泽东选集》后，兴奋地聚在一起，热烈地议论起来。一位女队员激动地说：北京的天气虽然很冷，可是我们心里却一直火热，因为我们心中有着一颗最红最红的红太阳。一名男队员双手捧着《毛泽东选集》说：我们在毛主席身边得到了干革命的宝书，这对我们一生都是有着重大意义的事件。另一位男队员接着说：今后，我们要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，按照毛主席的教导干革命，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，使我们铁打的社会主义江山永不变色！
    来自天津的“红色女兵长征队”的几名革命小将，每人手捧一套崭新的《毛泽东选集》，兴奋地喊着：“我们都有了一套红书，我们都有了！”三天后，她们就要高举红旗，带着革命宝书，踏上征途，向革命圣地延安进发了。她们说：长征路上，我们靠的就是毛泽东思想。我们要紧紧跟着毛主席，读一辈子毛主席的书，走一辈子革命的路，一辈子改造思想，一辈子为人民服务！
