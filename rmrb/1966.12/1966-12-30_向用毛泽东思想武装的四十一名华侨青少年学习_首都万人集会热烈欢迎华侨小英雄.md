A grand meeting of over ten thousand people, including Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, workers, people's commune members, PLA soldiers, and representatives of returned overseas Chinese, was held in the afternoon to warmly welcome the heroic fighting collective of forty-one overseas Chinese youth who had resolutely fought against the Indonesian reactionaries and to celebrate the brilliant victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Leaders from the central government and various departments, including Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Kang Sheng, Chen Yi, Liu Zhijian, Wu De, Liao Chengzhi, and Yao Zhongming, attended the meeting.

In his speech at the meeting, Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the struggle and victory of the forty-one youth are another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought. It has greatly dampened the arrogance of the Indonesian reactionaries and imperialists and boosted the revolutionary spirit of overseas Chinese patriots, the Chinese people, and the people of the world. Their deeds have set a brilliant example for overseas Chinese and for the people of the entire country. Everyone should learn from these young heroes of the Mao Zedong era.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech: We must warn the Indonesian government that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with, and the overseas Chinese of a powerful socialist China cannot be bullied by anyone. He emphasized that the 700 million Chinese people, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, will always stand on the side of the Indonesian people. The Indonesian reactionaries, who are arrogant for a time, are merely paper tigers and will be exposed and judged by history.

The welcoming ceremony was held in the majestic Great Hall of the People. The stage was adorned with a giant portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao in the center, flanked by ten red flags. Around the stage hung large banners with slogans such as: "Long live the great leader, teacher, commander, and helmsman Chairman Mao!" "The victory of the forty-one overseas Chinese youth in their heroic struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!" "Down with American imperialism! Down with modern revisionism! Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!"

At 2:30 PM, Comrade Zhou Enlai and the heroic overseas Chinese youth, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang "The East Is Red," and walked onto the stage together. The entire audience erupted in cheers, rhythmically shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Also on the stage were representatives of the Red Guards, workers, people's commune members, PLA, and returned overseas Chinese, as well as the brave diplomatic fighters Zhao Xiaoshou, who defended the five-starred red flag in Indonesia with his blood, and Huang Muhe, who remained steadfast in the face of Indonesian fascist violence. Also present were Wang Yaoting, Wang Weizhen, and Jiu Qingdong, who had fought bravely in Brazil, and relevant officials Lin Xiushi, Cui Gengsheng, Yuan Gang, as well as Indonesian friends Supeno and Indonesian students in China representative Sharma.

The representative of the Beijing Municipal Committee for Receiving the Forty-One Overseas Chinese Youth announced the beginning of the meeting. Following this, the entire audience sang "The East Is Red" and recited Chairman Mao's teachings:

"'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools. All the persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the long run, only serve to promote more extensive and more intense revolutionary struggles among the people."

"The people of the whole world, unite and defeat the American aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the world must have courage, dare to fight, not be afraid of difficulties and press on. Then, the whole world will belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be destroyed."

Vice Premier Chen Yi was the first to speak at the meeting, representing Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the Party Central Committee, and the State Council, to warmly welcome the forty-one overseas Chinese youth and express their most sincere greetings. (The full text of the speech is on page two.)

Acting Mayor of Beijing Wu De, representing the people of Beijing, said in his speech that the struggle and victory of the forty-one overseas Chinese youth once again proved that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon to defeat all ghosts and monsters. The banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of victory. Wu De said that the arrival of the forty-one overseas Chinese young heroes in Beijing is another great encouragement to the revolutionary masses of Beijing. The people of Beijing will definitely learn from their loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level.

Representatives of the Red Guards, Zhao Wenming, workers, Luo Naikuang, people's commune members, Zhang Guirong, PLA, Qian Aijun, and returned overseas Chinese, Yu Bingwei, also spoke at the welcoming ceremony. They expressed their warmest welcome to the forty-one overseas Chinese youth who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

In their speeches, they severely condemned the Indonesian reactionaries, under the orders of American imperialism and with the support of Soviet modern revisionism, for their heinous crimes of massacring and brutally persecuting the Indonesian people and overseas Chinese. They expressed their firm support for the Indonesian people's just struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and their own reactionaries, and for the independence, freedom, democracy, and liberation of their country.

They expressed their determination to follow the example of the forty-one overseas Chinese youth and other brave anti-violence refugees, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, to make our great motherland last forever, and to make greater contributions to the world proletarian revolution.

Representative of the forty-one overseas Chinese young heroes, Yu Yazhou, spoke at the meeting. He said excitedly, "Today, we have come to Beijing, the heart of our long-awaited and night-thought motherland, to the side of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Our hearts are so excited that they seem to jump out of our chests! We want to shout from the bottom of our hearts: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!"

After reporting to the motherland on their heroic struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries, Yu Yazhou said, "In this struggle, we relied on Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible powerful ideological weapon, to defeat the various persecutions of the Indonesian reactionaries, making them suffer a shameful defeat. This is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "We deeply feel that without our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, we would have nothing. The honor belongs to the great Communist Party of China, to our great leader Chairman Mao, and to the people of our motherland armed with Mao Zedong Thought."

Yu Yazhou sternly warned the Suharto-Nasution fascist clique: Your crazy anti-China and anti-Chinese policies will not save your dog lives, but will only accelerate your doom.

Yu Yazhou concluded, "Today, there are still many people in the world who have not been liberated. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life. We will have our hearts in our motherland and our eyes on the world, actively participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, support the liberation struggle of the people of the world, and strive for the realization of communism in our country and the world. We are determined to learn from the Red Guard comrades. We have fought against American imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries abroad, and now we will join the Red Guard comrades to fight against those in power who are taking the capitalist road within the Party. We are determined to temper ourselves in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, study the 'Three Articles,' overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and carry out the thought revolution to become reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

Two representatives of the refugees who participated in the anti-violence struggle at the "refugee camp" of the Indonesian Medan Chinese School on November 9 also attended the welcoming ceremony with the forty-one overseas Chinese youth. One of the refugee representatives, Liu Ruixia, spoke at the meeting. She said excitedly, "Chairman Mao! Your health is so good, which is the greatest happiness for us patriotic overseas Chinese, the greatest happiness for the people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the world. Only under your leadership in a socialist motherland can we overseas Chinese have such a powerful backing."

Liu Ruixia said, "In the future, we will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, read Chairman Mao's books, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to strive for building our country into a strong socialist iron fortress."

All the speeches at the meeting were met with waves of enthusiastic applause. During the speeches, people waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting: "The great leader Chairman Mao is the reddest sun in our hearts!" "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries! Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet modern revisionism! Down with the reactionaries of all countries!" "Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!" "Thoroughly criticize the capitalist reactionary line, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!"

Representative of the forty-one overseas Chinese young heroes, He Derong, read at the meeting a letter they wrote to our most beloved leader Chairman Mao while in the prison of the Indonesian reactionaries. The letter said: "In the struggle against the enemy, you are the red sun in our hearts. The works of Chairman Mao have given us boundless strength, making us dare to fight face to face with all ghosts and monsters and decisively defeat them!" "Whenever the struggle is the most difficult, we think of our motherland and Chairman Mao, and we advance bravely with full confidence!" After reading the letter, the entire audience shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!"

The forty-one overseas Chinese young heroes, while in the prison of the Indonesian reactionaries, carefully embroidered a red flag with the words "Long live Chairman Mao" in gold, and carefully made a five-pointed star with our great leader Chairman Mao's portrait in the center, surrounded by forty-one small red stars, symbolizing forty-one red hearts toward the sun, toward the great leader Chairman Mao. Today, they presented these two most precious gifts to Chairman Mao with great excitement. Comrade Zhou Enlai, on behalf of Chairman Mao, accepted the precious gifts from the forty-one overseas Chinese young heroes, and the entire audience shouted: "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" The applause and cheers lasted for a long time.

Comrade Kang Sheng then presented each of the heroic overseas Chinese youth with a copy of the revolutionary classic "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." At this moment, the scene was extremely moving, with ten thousand people shouting in unison: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good students of Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" People, with boundless passion, sang "The East Is Red" and "The Boat Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman."

The representative of the Indonesian Students' Union in China presented a banner with the words "The fighting friendship between the people of Indonesia and China will last forever! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!" to the overseas Chinese young heroes. This Indonesian friend, after presenting the banner, shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Down with American imperialism! Down with modern revisionism! Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" At this moment, the entire audience enthusiastically shouted: "Firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people!" "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people!"

At the end of the meeting, Comrade Zhou Enlai directed the ten thousand people to sing "The Boat Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman" together.
