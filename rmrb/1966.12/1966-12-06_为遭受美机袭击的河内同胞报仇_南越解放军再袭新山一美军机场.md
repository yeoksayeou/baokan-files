	To avenge the people of Hanoi attacked by U.S. aircraft, the Liberation Army of South Vietnam strikes again at the U.S. airbase in Tan Son Nhut.

	New China News Agency, December 5th: Saigon reports: On the evening of the 4th, the Liberation Army of South Vietnam once again attacked the U.S. airbase in Tan Son Nhut, Saigon, causing the already panicked U.S. aggressors to become even more disoriented. This is the second heavy blow the Liberation Army has dealt to the enemy following the intense artillery bombardment of this base in the early morning of the 4th.

	According to Western news agencies, the Liberation Army began firing in the western outskirts of Tan Son Nhut airport around 9 PM on the 4th, lasting for four and a half hours. At the same time, a hand grenade exploded at the entrance of Tan Son Nhut airport. The Liberation Army also fiercely attacked U.S. aircraft preparing to land at the airport that night.

	Another report states that on the 5th, the Liberation Forces also threw a hand grenade into the porch of a U.S. Air Force residence in Saigon, causing casualties among the enemy.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, December 5th: The "Liberation Radio" of South Vietnam issued a commentary on the 4th regarding the military and civilian forces of the West Saigon-Cho Lon region's fierce attack on the U.S. airbase in Tan Son Nhut and the destruction of the U.S. Army Psychological Warfare Headquarters, calling it a brilliant victory. The commentary states that for every act of aggression by the U.S. against North Vietnam, the military and civilian forces of South Vietnam will retaliate tenfold or even a hundredfold.

	The commentary points out that this victory shows that in South Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors have no safe rear bases. The military and civilian forces of South Vietnam are taking the initiative to attack the enemy on all fronts, annihilating a large number of U.S. and puppet troops.

	The commentary states that the great victory in Saigon also demonstrates the unparalleled courage and flexibility of the Liberation Army in the West Saigon-Cho Lon region. They bravely infiltrated the enemy's throat in Saigon to avenge the people of Hanoi who were attacked by U.S. aircraft on the 2nd, fearlessly sacrificing themselves to deal a heavy blow to the enemy.

	The commentary calls on the military and civilian forces of the West Saigon-Cho Lon region and other cities across the country to continue to be vigilant, preserve their strength, and be ready at any time to smash the U.S. aggressors' new "dry season counteroffensive" plan, achieve greater victories, and drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam.

    为遭受美机袭击的河内同胞报仇
    南越解放军再袭新山一美军机场
    新华社五日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放军四日晚间再次袭击西贡新山一美国空军基地，使惊魂未定的美国侵略者更加慌乱不安。这是解放军紧接着四日清晨猛烈炮轰了这个基地之后给敌人又一次的沉重打击。
    据西方通讯社报道，解放军在四日晚上大约九时在新山一机场西部边缘一带开始射击，一共持续了四个半小时之久。和这同时，新山一机场的门口爆炸了一枚手榴弹。解放军在这一天晚上还猛烈射击了准备到机场降落的美国飞机。
    另据报道，解放武装力量五日还向西贡美国空军的一所住房的门廊里投掷了手榴弹，使敌人遭到伤亡。
    新华社河内五日电　越南南方“解放电台”四日就越南南方西贡—嘉定地区军民猛烈袭击新山一美军机场和炸毁美国陆军心理战总部的辉煌胜利发表评论说，美国侵略者侵犯越南北方一次，南方军民就要十倍、百倍地惩罚它。
    评论指出，这一胜利表明，在越南南方，美国侵略者没有一个后方基地是安全的。南方军民正在各个战场上主动进攻敌人，消灭大量美伪军。
    评论说，西贡大捷也显示了西贡—嘉定地区解放军无比英勇和机智灵活的战斗精神。他们为了给二日遭受美机袭击的河内市人民报仇，不怕牺牲，英勇插入西贡市侵略军的咽喉给敌人以沉重打击。
    评论号召西贡—嘉定地区军民和全国其他城市军民今后要继续提高警惕，保存力量，随时准备粉碎美国侵略者新的“旱季反攻”计划，夺取更大的胜利，把美国侵略者赶出越南。
