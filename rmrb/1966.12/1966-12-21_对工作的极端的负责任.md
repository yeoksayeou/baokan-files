Twenty-seven years ago today, our beloved leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to learn from Comrade Norman Bethune. For decades, Bethune's communist spirit has inspired every revolutionary. During his lifetime, Bethune had boundless love and admiration for our Chairman Mao. In his diary, he wrote, "Chairman Mao is the greatest person in the world..." We learn from Bethune to love Chairman Mao and the people as he did. We learn from Bethune to be a person who "does not seek personal gain but dedicates oneself to the welfare of others."

Below is the story of Comrade Norman Bethune and an excerpt from a comic strip.

Extreme Responsibility in Work

During the famous Battle of Chiwei, a wounded soldier was brought down from the frontlines—Captain Xu of the 716th Regiment, 3rd Company. He was shot in the abdomen during the charge, with a ruptured intestinal mesenteric artery and severe abdominal bleeding, and was on the verge of death. Comrade Norman Bethune quickly performed surgery on him. After the operation, the soldier had difficulty breathing. Bethune then took out carpentry tools and made a backrest for the soldier himself. While sawing, he said, "A battlefield surgeon must also be able to do the work of a carpenter, tailor, blacksmith, and barber. Only then can one be considered a good surgeon." He also personally prepared four meals a day for Captain Xu. The chief of the medical department saw that Dr. Bethune was really too tired and advised him to let the cook do it, but he refused. He said, "Medicines are only effective to a certain extent. Physiotherapy and dietary therapy, combined with good nursing, can quickly restore the health of the wounded and sick. Let me do it..." Every so often, he would go to check on Captain Xu. He also saved canned milk and coffee for Captain Xu, placed pears given by others by Captain Xu's pillow, put cigarettes in his mouth, and lit them for him. When the troops moved, he had Captain Xu carried and followed alongside. Due to Bethune's timely treatment and meticulous care, twenty-eight days later, Captain Xu's wound was healed, and he was then sent to the rear for recuperation. Before leaving, Captain Xu grabbed Bethune's clothes, tears streaming down his face, and said, "Dr. Bethune, I can only repay you by killing more enemies." Bethune patted Captain Xu's shoulder and said, "This is my duty. Don't thank me. We are all comrades. I saved you, and you can kill more enemies and defend the motherland."

### 对工作的极端的负责任

    二十七年前的今天，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席发出向白求恩同志学习的伟大号召。几十年来，白求恩的共产主义精神激励着我们每个革命者。白求恩生前，无限热爱、无限敬佩我们的毛主席，他在日记中说，毛主席“是我们世界上最伟大的人物……”。我们向白求恩学习，要像他那样热爱毛主席，热爱人民。向白求恩学习，要像他那样做一个“毫不利己专门利人”的人。
    下面是白求恩同志的故事和连环画片断。
    对工作的极端的负责任
    在有名的齐会战斗中，火线上下来一个腹部负伤的伤员——七一六团三连徐连长，他冲锋时中了枪弹，肠间膜动脉管破裂，腹部大量出血，眼看就要死亡。白求恩同志迅速地为他施行了手术。手术后，伤员呼吸发生困难。他便拿出木匠工具自己动手替伤员做了一副靠背架。一边锯一边说：“一个战地外科医生，同时要会作木匠、缝纫匠、铁匠和理发匠的工作。这样，才能算是好的外科医生。”他还每天亲自给徐连长做四顿饭。卫生部首长看见白求恩大夫实在太疲劳了，劝他让炊事员做，他不答应。他说：“药物只有在一定程度上才有用，理学疗法和食饵疗法配合好，护理得好，伤病员就能够很快恢复健康。还是让我自己来做……”每隔一定时间，他就去看徐连长一次。他还把罐头牛奶和咖啡省下来给徐连长吃，把别人送给他的梨子放在徐连长枕边，把香烟放在他嘴里，给他点火。部队行动时，他叫人抬着徐连长，自己跟着徐连长一块走。由于白求恩同志这样及时的治疗和精心的护理，二十八天以后，徐连长的伤口已没有问题了，这才送到后方去休养。徐连长临走时，抓着白求恩同志的衣服，感动得流下了眼泪，说：“白求恩大夫，我以后只有多杀敌人来报答你。”白求恩同志拍着徐连长的肩膀说：“这是我应尽的责任，不要感谢，大家都是同志。我把你救活了，你就可以多杀敌人，保卫祖国。”
