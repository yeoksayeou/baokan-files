The Soviet revisionist clique is vigorously boosting the morale of the reactionaries in India and Indonesia. It has provided the Indian government with a large amount of rubles and weapons and has agreed to extend the debt repayment period for the right-wing regime in Indonesia.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on December 5, New Delhi: The Soviet revisionist leadership recently provided the Indian government with a loan of 970 million rubles (approximately 8.3 billion rupees) to prop up the reactionary rule of the Congress Party, which is in internal and external difficulties.

According to the Indian News Agency, the Soviet economic delegation led by Skachkov, Chairman of the Soviet State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, held talks with the Indian government delegation in New Delhi on November 30 and agreed that during India's Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970), the Soviet Union would provide this loan to India.

The Soviet revisionist leadership's loan to the Indian government this time is more than double the amount of "economic aid" provided by the Soviet Union during India's Third Five-Year Plan and much more than the total "economic aid" provided by Khrushchev during his ten years in power.

According to a report by TASS on December 3, the trade delegations of the two countries signed an agreement in Moscow on December 3. According to the agreement, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and India in 1967 will reach a record high of 2.55 billion rupees in history.

The Soviet revisionist leadership is also continuously providing weapons to India to help the Indian reactionary ruling clique accelerate military buildup and prepare for its expansionist ambitions. Indian Defense Minister Singh confirmed on November 21 that the Soviet government had provided the Indian government with three Tu-124 aircraft for use by the Indian Air Force. The Soviet government is also continuously providing the Indian government with missiles, submarines, warships, tanks, and other weapons, and sending experts to India to help with military training.

The Soviet government's intensified "aid" to the Indian reactionaries is part of the global collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union and the new holy alliance formed with reactionaries from various countries to oppose communism, the people, revolution, and China. The Indian reactionaries play a particularly important role in this alliance. Therefore, the Soviet Union's "aid" to the Indian government has been rapidly increasing with the development of the Indian government's anti-China madness. Now, seeing that the Congress Party's reactionary government is on the verge of collapse politically and economically, it is eager to transfuse blood for the Indian reactionary ruling clique to help the Indian reactionaries maintain their shaky rule.

According to foreign media reports, the Soviet government also exploits and plunders India through trade. India purchases Soviet goods at prices 20% higher than the world market. Meanwhile, the Soviet government sells leather, jute, tea, and other items obtained from India under the trade agreement for cash in the Western market.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta: The Soviet revisionist leadership has recently provided political and economic support to the right-wing military clique in Indonesia in various ways, attempting to help it get out of its internal and external difficulties. Soviet Ambassador to Indonesia Sedyanko once shamelessly praised this reactionary regime in front of Suharto, the head of the Indonesian right-wing military government, for "continuing to implement its policy of opposing imperialism and colonialism," and expressed that the Soviet government's attitude towards the Indonesian government remains unchanged.

To help the Indonesian right-wing military government get out of its serious economic difficulties, the Soviet government signed an agreement with Indonesian Cabinet Advisor Suprayogi on December 23 in Moscow, agreeing to extend the repayment period for the huge debt and interest owed to the Soviet Union by the Indonesian right-wing military government.

According to a spokesman for the Indonesian Embassy in the Soviet Union, the authorities of Indonesia and the Soviet Union have also reached a new agreement to increase bilateral trade.

    加紧拉拢各国反动派拼凑反华联盟
    苏修集团使劲为印度和印尼反动派打气
    给印度政府大批卢布和军火　答应印尼右派政权延期还债
    据新华社五日讯　新德里消息：苏联修正主义领导集团最近又给印度政府九亿七千万卢布（约合八十三亿卢比）的巨额贷款，以扶植内外交困的国大党政府的反动统治。
    据印度新闻处报道，正在新德里访问的由苏联国家对外经济联络委员会主席斯卡奇科夫率领的苏联经济代表团，同印度政府代表团在十一月三十日会谈后确定，在印度第四个五年（一九六六——一九七○）计划期间，苏联向印度提供这笔贷款。
    苏联修正主义领导集团这次给印度政府的巨额贷款，比印度第三个五年计划期间苏联给印度的“经济援助”增加了一倍多，比赫鲁晓夫十年执政期间向印度提供的全部“经济援助”还要多得多。
    据塔斯社三日报道，苏印两国贸易代表团三日还在莫斯科签订了一项协定。根据协定，一九六七年苏印贸易额将达到两国历史上的最高纪录——二十五亿五千万卢比。
    苏联修正主义领导集团还正在源源不断地给印度提供武器，以便帮助印度反动统治集团加紧扩军备战，为实现其扩张主义的野心作准备。印度国防部长辛格在十一月二十一日证实，苏联政府又给了印度政府三架图—124型飞机供印度空军使用。苏联政府还正在源源给印度政府提供导弹、潜水艇、军舰、坦克车等其他武器，派出专家到印度帮助进行军事训练等。
    苏联政府加紧“援助”印度反动派，是美苏全球勾结并同各国反动派组成的反共、反人民、反革命、反华的新神圣同盟的一个组成部分。印度反动派在这个同盟中起着特别的作用。因此，苏联对印度政府的“援助”，随着印度政府的反华病狂的发展而飞速增长。现在，它看到印度国大党反动政府在政治、经济上濒于破产，就迫不及待地为印度反动统治集团输血，来帮助印度反动派维持摇摇欲坠的统治。
    据外国报刊透露，苏联政府还通过贸易对印度实行残酷的剥削和掠夺。印度购买苏联商品，比世界市场的价格要高百分之二十。而苏联政府在贸易协定下从印度得到的皮革、黄麻、茶等，都在西方市场以现金出售。
    据新华社讯　雅加达消息：苏联修正主义领导集团最近在政治上和经济上给予印度尼西亚右派军人集团以种种支持，企图帮助它摆脱内外交困的处境。苏联驻印尼大使塞坚科曾经当着印尼右派军人政权头子苏哈托的面，无耻地吹捧这个反动政权“继续执行它的反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义政策”，并且表示苏联政府对印尼政府的态度不变。
    为了帮助印尼右派军人政权摆脱严重的经济困难，苏联政府同印尼内阁顾问苏普拉约基二十三日在莫斯科签订了一项协定，答应印尼右派军人政权延期偿还欠下苏联的巨额债款和利息。
    据印尼驻苏联使馆发言人宣布，印尼和苏联当局还达成了关于增加双方贸易的新协议。
