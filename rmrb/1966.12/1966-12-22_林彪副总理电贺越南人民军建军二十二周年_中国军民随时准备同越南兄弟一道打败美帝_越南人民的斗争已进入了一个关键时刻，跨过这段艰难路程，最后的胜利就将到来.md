	BEIJING, Dec. 21 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao today sent a cable to Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Vo Nguyen Giap, extending warm congratulations to the Vietnam People's Army on the 22nd anniversary of its founding. In the cable, Lin Biao reiterated: The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have consistently and resolutely supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. We have long been determined to make any sacrifice and are ready at any time to join our Vietnamese brothers and their army in defeating the American aggressors and driving them out of Vietnam completely.

	The full text of the cable is as follows:

	To Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense
	Vo Nguyen Giap, Dear Comrade Minister:

	On the occasion of the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the heroic Vietnam People's Army, I, on behalf of the Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and in my personal name, extend my warmest greetings and most enthusiastic congratulations to you, and through you, to all the Vietnamese people and soldiers of the Vietnam People's Army.

	Under the wise leadership of the Vietnam Labor Party headed by Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the heroic Vietnamese people and their army have been continuously dealing heavy blows to the U.S. aggressors in their great struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, achieving brilliant victories. The struggle of the Vietnamese people has reached a critical moment. Once this difficult period is overcome, final victory will be at hand. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are greatly encouraged and inspired by the brilliant victories achieved by our Vietnamese comrades-in-arms.

	The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army strongly condemn and express their utmost indignation at the recent savage air raids by U.S. imperialism on the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi. These savage acts are an important part of the "peace talks" conspiracy hatched by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. They are also a sign that the day of its final defeat in Vietnam is approaching. No matter how it escalates, no matter how it plays the "peace talks" trick, and no matter how eagerly its running dogs and lackeys work for it, the heroic Vietnamese people and soldiers will not be deceived or intimidated. The fate of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam is doomed to failure. We are firmly convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, unleash the boundless power of people's war, and ultimately defeat the U.S. aggressors, achieving the great cause of national reunification.

	The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have consistently and resolutely supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. We have long been determined to make any sacrifice and are ready at any time to join our Vietnamese brothers and their army in defeating the American aggressors and driving them out of Vietnam completely.

	We wish the Vietnamese people and their army continuous and greater victories.

	We wish the fraternal friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Vietnam eternal glory.

	Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, Lin Biao
	Beijing, December 21, 1966

    越南人民的斗争已进入了一个关键时刻，跨过这段艰难路程，最后的胜利就将到来
    新华社二十一日讯　国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪，今天打电报给越南民主共和国副总理兼国防部长武元甲大将，热烈祝贺越南人民军建军二十二周年。林彪副总理在电报中重申：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，一贯坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，并且早已下定决心，不怕任何牺牲，随时准备同兄弟的越南人民和军队一道，共同打败美国侵略者，直到美国强盗干净全部地从越南滚出去。电报全文如下：越南民主共和国副总理兼国防部长
  武元甲大将亲爱的部长同志：
    在兄弟的越南人民军建军二十二周年的时候，我谨代表中国人民和中国人民解放军全体指战员，并以我个人的名义，向你，并通过你向兄弟的越南人民和越南人民军全体战友，致以最亲切的问候和最热烈的节日祝贺。
    英雄的越南人民及其军队，在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的英明领导下，在抗美救国的伟大斗争中，不断给美国侵略者以沉重的打击，接连取得辉煌的胜利。越南人民的斗争已经进入了一个关键的时刻，跨过这段艰难路程，最后的胜利就将到来。中国人民和中国人民解放军，对兄弟的越南军民所取得的光辉胜利，感到无比欢欣鼓舞。
    中国人民和中国人民解放军，对于美帝国主义最近轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内的滔天罪行，表示极大的愤慨和强烈的谴责。美帝国主义的这一野蛮行径，是它伙同其帮凶推行“和谈”阴谋的重要组成部分，也是它侵略越南最后失败的日子快要到来的表现。不管它怎样“升级”，不管它怎样玩弄“和谈”骗局，也不管它的走狗、帮凶们如何起劲地替它卖力，英雄的越南军民是骗不了、吓不倒的。美帝国主义在越南的失败命运必定是无可挽回的。我们坚信，英雄的越南人民，一定能够冲破一切困难和障碍，发挥人民战争的无穷威力，最后打败美国侵略者，实现统一自己祖国的伟大正义事业。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，一贯坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，并且早已下定决心，不怕任何牺牲，随时准备同兄弟的越南人民和军队一道，共同打败美国侵略者，直到美国强盗干净全部地从越南滚出去。
    祝越南人民及其军队不断取得新的更大的胜利。
    祝中越两国人民和军队之间的战斗友谊万古长青。
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长  林彪
    一九六六年十二月二十一日于北京
