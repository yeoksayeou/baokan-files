	Bai Honglan is a female member of the commune. After hearing others talk about the importance of studying Chairman Mao's works, she immediately urged her husband, Lu Yuanxi, to buy a copy of the "Selected Readings from Mao Zedong's Works" (Type B).

	Someone in the village saw this and said to her, "You can't read a single character, how can you read Chairman Mao's books?"

	Bai Honglan smiled and said, "I couldn't read before, but now I want to start. I have a head, two ears, and a mouth. Isn't it good to listen? Isn't it good to remember? Isn't it good to ask?"

	Someone disbelievingly said, "Can you understand it?"

	Bai Honglan saw that others didn't believe she could understand, and she felt a bit angry. She said, "Chairman Mao's books are written for us poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao's words are spoken to us poor and lower-middle peasants. Why can't I understand them!"

	However, Bai Honglan was already in her late forties, illiterate, with six children and a lot of housework. The difficulties were indeed many! She started studying in the commune's cultural room, listening carefully to what the teacher said, but she couldn't remember. Many women studying with her would ask questions while listening, and everyone was eager to learn. Bai Honglan was so anxious that her head ached. Looking at the characters in the book, she couldn't recognize them and wished she could learn them all quickly. One day, while the commune was planting trees, some commune members recited the ten manifestations of "Opposing Liberalism" while working. Bai Honglan couldn't recite a single one. Bai Honglan thought to herself, "Bai Honglan, do you really want to study Chairman Mao's books? If you do, you must overcome this difficulty."

	One night, lying in bed, she thought, it was the great Party and the great Chairman Mao who led the poor and lower-middle peasants to stand up and walk on the bright path. Her heart was filled with boundless love for Chairman Mao, and she eagerly wanted to study Chairman Mao's works. But she immediately couldn't recognize so many characters. What should she do? She thought and thought, and her two older children could recognize characters. If they helped her study, wouldn't that be good? Thinking of this solution, she was overjoyed. The next day, she told the children, "In the old society, we poor people couldn't go to school, so Mom can't read. Now I want to study Chairman Mao's books and learn revolutionary theories. You must help me study well." The children saw that she was determined to study Chairman Mao's works and were all very happy, all willing to help Mom study Chairman Mao's books. The family discussed and organized a family study group. This group was the first family study group in the production brigade to study Chairman Mao's works. With its establishment, many family study groups were set up one after another.

	From then on, every evening, Bai Honglan's family would gather together to help each other study Chairman Mao's works. The children would read a sentence, and Bai Honglan would follow with a sentence; Bai Honglan would recite a sentence, and the children would check it in the book. In this way, they would read and recite, often studying for several hours at a time. One day, the children taught Bai Honglan to recognize the characters "people." After three, five times, a long time passed, and she still couldn't remember them. Bai Honglan was very anxious, and others were also anxious for her. Her husband, Lu Yuanxi, blurted out, "You are really stupid!" Hearing this, Bai Honglan angrily said, "In the old society, it was so difficult for the poor to go to school. You don't hate the old society, but you say I'm stupid! You should help me with class feelings." With her boundless love for Chairman Mao, she didn't stop until she recognized these two characters.

	Sometimes, Bai Honglan would talk to the children about family history, using the method of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness to educate them to love the Party, love Chairman Mao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In this way, the children helped Mom study Chairman Mao's works even more seriously.

	When encountering difficulties in her studies, Bai Honglan would look up at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall and see Chairman Mao smiling at her affectionately, and her spirit would rise. Even when she went to bed and blew out the lamp, Bai Honglan would still be reciting. Sometimes, if she couldn't recite a part, she would light the lamp, have the children find it and read it to her, and then continue reciting. Every morning when she got up, while cooking, eating, or walking on the road, working in the fields, Bai Honglan would be reciting. In this way, after some days of effort, she finally memorized important articles by Chairman Mao such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People."

	Bai Honglan not only memorized them but also worked hard to put them into practice. When faced with a task, she would seriously follow Chairman Mao's words. For example, last winter, the commune was digging ditches to accumulate fertilizer. The next day, a lot of water seeped out, and when everyone went to work to dig, they had to first remove the water before they could dig, wasting a lot of manpower. Bai Honglan saw this situation and thought, Chairman Mao said, "Never seek anything for oneself and always devote oneself to others." We should do everything according to this. We should think for the collective. So, every morning, before dawn, she would quietly get up and remove the water, so that everyone could start work right away, digging or carrying, without wasting time. For one, two days, everyone didn't notice, but after a long time, everyone was puzzled, why didn't the water seep up anymore? Later, everyone found out it was Bai Honglan who removed it, and they all praised her for truly studying Chairman Mao's works and putting them into practice. Someone even joked with her, "You did all the good deeds, and you didn't even let others know!" Bai Honglan smiled and said, "Doing this little thing, what's there to talk about. Compared to Zhang Side and Norman Bethune, I'm still far, far behind! I want to study Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime and use them for a lifetime!" She wrote "Serve the people wholeheartedly" on the wall outside her door to let all the commune members supervise her, so that she would see these ten big red characters every morning and check herself in the mirror every day.

    柏洪兰

    女社员柏洪兰听了别人介绍学习毛主席著作的重要性以后，马上催她的爱人陆元喜去买回来一本《毛泽东著作选读》乙种本。
    村里有人看见了，就对她说：“你一个字不识，还能读毛主席的书吗？”
    柏洪兰笑着说：“过去不能读，现在要开始读。我有一个脑袋，两只耳朵，一张嘴，不好听？不好记？不好问？”
    有人不相信地说：“你能听懂？”
    柏洪兰见别人不相信自己能听懂，心中不免有些生气。她就说：“毛主席的书，是为我们贫下中农写的，毛主席的话，是对我们贫下中农说的，为什么听不懂！”
    话是这么说，可是柏洪兰已是四十七、八岁的人了，自己不识字，又有六个孩子，一大堆家务，困难的确不少！开始在队里文化室学习，老师说的讲的，她认真地听，就是记不住。一块学习的许多妇女都是边听边问，大家抢着学。柏洪兰着急得脑袋直发胀，看着书上的字认不得，恨不能快点都学会。有一天队里栽树，有的社员边劳动，边背《反对自由主义》里的十一种表现，柏洪兰一条也背不出来。柏洪兰心里说：“柏洪兰呀，柏洪兰，你学毛主席的书真心不真心？要真心就要克服这个困难。”
    一天夜里，她躺在床上想，是伟大的党、伟大的毛主席，领导贫下中农翻了身，走在一条光明大道上。她心中充满了对毛主席的无限热爱，迫切地想学毛主席著作，可马上又认不了那么多的字，怎么办呢？她想来想去，自己两个大孩子都认字，如果叫他们帮助自己学习这不很好吗？想到这条办法，她高兴极了。第二天，就向孩子们说：“旧社会，我们穷人念不起书，妈妈才不识字。现在我要学毛主席的书，学革命的道理，你们要好好帮助我。”孩子们见她下决心学习毛主席著作，都很高兴，都愿意帮助妈妈读毛主席的书。一家人商量以后，就组织了个家庭学习小组。这个小组是生产大队里学习毛主席著作的第一个家庭学习小组，随着它的诞生，许多家庭学习小组接连成立起来了。
    从此以后，每天一到晚上，柏洪兰一家人就围坐在一起，互相帮助学习毛主席著作。孩子念一句，柏洪兰跟着念一句；柏洪兰背一句，叫孩子在书上对一句。就这样念啊、背啊，常常一连学几个小时。有一天，孩子教柏洪兰认“人民”两字，三遍、五遍，好长时间过去了，她仍然记不牢。柏洪兰急得很，别人也为她着急。她爱人陆元喜顺口说一句：“你这人真笨啊！”一听这话，柏洪兰生气地说：“过去穷人上学多难啊！你们不恨旧社会，倒说我笨！你们应当带着阶级感情帮助我。”她就这样带着对毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，一直到认识了这两个字才算罢休。
    有时，柏洪兰向孩子谈家史，用忆苦思甜的办法教育他们热爱党、热爱毛主席，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。这样，孩子们帮助妈妈学毛主席著作就更认真了。
    在学习遇到困难的时候，柏洪兰抬头望着墙上的毛主席像，看到毛主席对她在慈祥地微笑着，劲头就来了。就是上床睡觉，吹灭了灯，柏洪兰还在那里背。有时候，哪里背不上来，她就点上灯，让孩子找出来念给她听，再继续背。每天早上起来，烧饭、吃饭，或者走在路上、下田劳动的时候，柏洪兰都在背。就这样，经过一些天的努力，她终于背会了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等重要文章。
    柏洪兰不但能背，更下功夫去用。一事当前，她就认真对照着毛主席的话去办。比方去年冬天，队里挑塘泥积肥，当天挑了泥，第二天就有很多水渗出来，大家上工挑泥时，先要把水掏掉才能挑，浪费了不少人力。柏洪兰看到这种情况，心里想，毛主席说“毫不利己专门利人”，我们就应该事事照着做，应该为集体着想。于是，每天一早，天还不亮，她就悄悄起来把水掏掉，好让大家一上工，就挖的挖，挑的挑，不浪费时间。一天、两天，大家还没注意，时间长了，大家挺奇怪，水为什么不往上渗了呢？后来大家才知道是柏洪兰掏的，都称赞她真是学了毛主席著作就认真用。有人还对她开玩笑地说：“好事都让你一个人做了，还不肯让人家知道！”柏洪兰笑着说：“做这点事，有什么值得说的。比起张思德、白求恩还差得很远很远呢！我要把毛主席的书，学一辈子，用一辈子！”她把“全心全意地为人民服务”写在门外墙上，让全体社员督促自己，让自己每天一早就见到这十个红色的大字，每天照照镜子。
