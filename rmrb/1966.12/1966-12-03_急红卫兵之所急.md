One day, a soldier named Chen Fanglin was assigned to be the company commander of a Red Guard unit. He saw a Red Guard with very long hair waiting in line at a barbershop. The line was very long. The Red Guard anxiously asked the barber, "Can I go to see Chairman Mao with my hair this long?" Chen Fanglin thought, "Indeed, how can Chairman Mao's guests not be able to get a haircut? The leadership sent me to receive Chairman Mao's guests, so I should think of a way."

What method should be used? Do it yourself. Chen Fanglin ran to the store to buy a hair cutting tool. He ran more than twenty miles and visited four stores before he finally bought a set of barber tools. Upon returning, some comrades offered to pay for the tools. Chen Fanglin said, "How can that be? I bought the tools to give the Red Guards a haircut, so they can go to receive Chairman Mao's inspection clean, neat, and happy. This is the wish of the Red Guards and also my wish. We should also be anxious about the things that the Red Guards are anxious about; otherwise, we cannot be good servants of the people."

For many days, Chen Fanglin would give haircuts to the Red Guards whenever he had time. He had already given haircuts to dozens of Red Guards, making their hair neat and tidy. The Red Guards regarded this matter as the most vivid education for themselves. They said, "The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army always think of us, they are models of serving the people, and they are truly Chairman Mao's good soldiers. We will definitely learn from the People's Liberation Army and inherit the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army."

    急红卫兵之所急
    一天，被派到红卫兵某连当连长的解放军战士陈方林同志，看到一位头发很长的红卫兵到理发馆排队理发。队排得很长。那个红卫兵着急地对理发员说：“能让我带着这样长的头发去见毛主席吗？”陈方林想：“是啊，怎么能让毛主席请来的客人理不上发呢？领导上派我来接待毛主席的客人，我应该想办法。”
    想什么办法呢？自己动手。陈方林跑到商店去买理发的推子。跑了二十多里路，找了四个商店，才买到一套理发工具。回来，有的同志提出要替他出钱，陈方林说：“那怎么行呢！我买了工具，给红卫兵理发，让他们干干净净、整整齐齐、高高兴兴去接受毛主席的检阅，这是红卫兵的心愿，也是我的心愿。红卫兵着急的事，我们也应当着急，否则，就当不好人民的勤务员。”
    好多天了，陈方林一有空就给红卫兵理发，已有好几十个红卫兵的头发被剪得整整齐齐。红卫兵们把这件事看作是对自己最生动的教育。他们说：“解放军同志处处为我们着想，是为人民服务的榜样，不愧为毛主席的好战士，我们决心好好向解放军学习，继承解放军的光荣传统。”
