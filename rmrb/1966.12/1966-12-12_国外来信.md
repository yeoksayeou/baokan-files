Marxists-Leninists Must Study Mao Zedong Thought

I firmly believe that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary world. Contemporary Marxists-Leninists who discuss modern revolution without studying Mao Zedong Thought are mistaken. It is precisely because of Mao Zedong Thought that China has achieved the 12,000-ton water press machine, the Daqing Oil Field, and the accomplishments of Dazhai.

Chairman Mao Leads the Poor People to Happiness

The name of Chairman Mao has spread to every corner of the world. Even newly enrolled students shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Mao Zedong Thought has greatly inspired the people of various countries. Chairman Mao leads the poor people of the world to shake off their miserable lives and move towards happiness. Therefore, Chairman Mao is respected by the people of Cambodia and the people of the whole world.

Chairman Mao is the Leader of the International Communist Movement

The revolutionary theories of Comrade Mao Zedong attract Marxist-Leninists fighting all over the world. Comrade Mao Zedong is the living Lenin of our time, the greatest Marxist-Leninist revolutionary in the world. Since the death of Stalin, Comrade Mao Zedong has been the leader of the international communist movement.

Chairman Mao is the Hope of the Revolutionary People of the World

Mao Zedong Thought is not only a powerful ideological weapon for the Chinese people in their revolutionary struggle, but also a powerful weapon for the revolutionary people of the world in their struggles on the political, military, and economic fronts. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the people, it can generate tremendous material force and change the face of the world. Chairman Mao belongs to the revolutionary people of the world. Chairman Mao is the hope of the revolutionary people of the world.

Chairman Mao is the Great Savior of the World Working Class

I am a British youth. I will never take the revisionist road. The only road is the road of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought.

Chinese youth can indeed feel proud because you can study the works of Chairman Mao. However, the works of Chairman Mao do not belong only to the Chinese people, but also to the proletariat of the whole world, including our country. Chairman Mao is the great savior of the working class.

    马列主义者必须学习毛泽东思想
    我深信，毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马列主义。当代的马克思列宁主义者，如果不学习毛泽东思想而议论现代的革命这是错误的。正是因为有了毛泽东思想，中国才有一万二千吨水压机、大庆油田和大寨的成就。
