Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam recently sent a letter to Chairman Ho Chi Minh and Vice Chairman Ton Duc Thang of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In the letter, he strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for their aggressive war against South Vietnam and their barbaric bombing of the North. The letter emphasized that the military and civilian population of South Vietnam are not afraid of hardship or sacrifice. No matter how long the resistance lasts, they will resolutely fight and decisively win, resolutely striving for independence and freedom.

The letter, which was handed over by Nguyen Van Thang, head of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in North Vietnam, said: Our Vietnam is a unified country from Lang Son to Ca Mau. The Vietnamese nation, with its thousands of years of history, is a heroic nation. After the nine-year victory over the French colonialists and American interventionists, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys trampled on the Geneva Accords. The United States sent troops to trample on the land of the South, attempting to turn the people of the South into its slaves, to permanently divide our country, and to turn the South into a springboard for attacking and invading the North.

The letter went on to say: The entire military and civilian population of the South are closely united, carrying forward the glorious traditions of the heroic Vietnamese nation and the unbreakable South. They have fought bravely and achieved brilliant victories, and are determined to fight to the end, to liberate the South, to defend the North, and to ultimately unite the country.

The letter pointed out: "The American aggressors, in order to save their failing situation in the South, attempted to force the people of the North to abandon their sacred duty to their fellow countrymen in the South and to the country, and blatantly sent planes to bomb the North. The people of the North, who have long made up their minds, while engaging in production competitions, bravely fought and decisively defeated the destructive war of the American aggressors, and at the same time, fully fulfilled their duty as the national rear and revolutionary base."

The letter said: The people of the South day and night yearn for their beloved North, and with hearts full of joy and excitement, listen to every report of production and battle victories from the North. At the same time, they express their deep indignation at the American aggressors' mad bombing of the North, killing our people, and destroying the common wealth of the entire nation.

Nguyen Huu Tho said in the letter: On July 17 of this year, Chairman Ho issued a call to the entire military and civilian population to resolutely promote the anti-American, national salvation struggle. This sacred call from the heart of the country has strengthened the power and determination of the 14 million people of the South to resist America and save the nation. The armed forces of South Vietnam have become even more valiant, annihilating the American invaders and traitorous lackeys.

The letter concluded by saying: Vietnam is a whole. The Vietnamese nation is a whole. The deep bond of kinship from south to north of the Vietnamese nation, forged over thousands of years, is unbreakable by any force. In the life-and-death struggle with the American aggressors, whether in times of difficulty or victory, the people of the South always yearn for the 17 million fellow countrymen of the North, yearn for Chairman Ho. The Vietnamese people will surely win! The American aggressors will surely be defeated! South Vietnam will surely be liberated! Vietnam will surely be united!

    阮友寿主席写信给胡志明主席
    越南南方必获解放　越南一定统一
    全体南方军民不怕艰苦牺牲，决心战斗到彻底胜利
    新华社河内十六日电　越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿最近在给越南民主共和国主席胡志明和副主席孙德胜的一封信中，严厉谴责美帝国主义对越南南方进行侵略战争和对北方进行野蛮轰炸。信里强调指出：越南南方军民不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，不管抗战要延长多久，也要坚决战斗，坚决夺取胜利，坚决争取独立和自由。
    这封由越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团团长阮文进转交的信里说，我们越南，是一个从谅山到金瓯的统一的国家。具有几千年历史的越南民族是一个英雄的民族。在抗击法国殖民者和美国干涉者的九年抗战胜利以后，美帝国主义及其走狗践踏了日内瓦协议。美国派遣军队蹂躏南方的土地，妄想把南方人民变成它的奴隶，长期分割我国，把南方变成进攻和侵略北方的跳板。
    信里接着说，全体南方军民紧密团结，发扬英雄的越南民族和坚如铜墙铁壁的南方的光荣传统，进行了英勇的战斗，取得了辉煌的胜利，并且决心战斗到彻底胜利，解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。
    信里指出：“美国强盗为了挽救它在南方的败局，妄图迫使北方同胞放弃对骨肉的南方同胞、对祖国负有的神圣义务，而明目张胆地派遣飞机轰炸北方。早就下定决心的北方军民，一边开展生产竞赛，一边英勇战斗，坚决打败美国强盗的破坏性战争，同时全心全力地履行了作为全国大后方和革命根据地的义务。”
    信里说，南方同胞日夜向往着亲爱的北方，满怀欢欣鼓舞的心情，倾听着北方的每一个生产和战斗的捷报，同时对美国强盗疯狂轰炸北方，杀害我国人民，摧毁全民族的共同财富的罪行，表示无比愤慨。
    阮友寿在信里说，今年七月十七日，胡主席向全国军民发出了坚决促进抗美救国战斗的号召。这一个从祖国的心脏发出的神圣号召，增强了一千四百万南方人民抗美救国的力量和决心。越南南方解放武装力量更加奋勇前进，消灭美国侵略者和卖国走狗。
    信里最后说，越南是一个整体。越南民族是一个整体。从南到北的越南民族千年万载结成的骨肉深情，是任何力量也破坏不了的。在与美国侵略强盗进行你死我活的战斗中，不论是在困难或者在胜利的时候，南方人民都时刻向往着一千七百万骨肉的北方同胞，向往着胡主席。越南人民必胜！美国侵略强盗必败！越南南方一定获得解放！越南一定统一！
