	We are the propagators of Mao Zedong Thought,
	Carrying the battle flags of the old Red Army,
	Facing the wind and snow, hacking through thorns and brambles.
	The propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought have set out,
	The call to march shakes the heavens and earth!
	Singing the battle songs of the old Red Army,
	Crossing valleys and rivers, climbing mountains and hills.
	The radiant treasure book lights our way,
	We spread Mao Zedong Thought everywhere.
	Following in the footsteps of the old Red Army, we march forward bravely,
	In the storm, red seagulls take flight!
	Learning, applying, and advancing in red,
	We are the propagators of Mao Zedong Thought!

    我们是毛泽东思想的宣传员	诗信诗　李保林画
    举着老红军举过的战旗，
    顶风冒雪，披荆斩棘。
    毛泽东思想宣传队出发了，
    进军的号角震天动地！
    唱着老红军唱过的战歌，
    越沟涉水，翻山过坡。
    金光灿烂的宝书把路照亮，
    我们把毛泽东思想到处传播。
    踩着老红军的脚印勇往直前，
    暴风雨中飞起红色的海燕！
    一路学，一路用，一路红，
    我们是毛泽东思想的宣传员！
