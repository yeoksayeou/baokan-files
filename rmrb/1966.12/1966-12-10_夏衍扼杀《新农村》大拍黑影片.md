Newsreels are originally an effective tool for the Party to educate hundreds of millions of peasants. However, Xia Yan and his gang have been vigorously opposing and ruthlessly suppressing them. The Central Newsreel Film Studio had produced a specialized periodical film for rural areas called "New Countryside," which was halted twice by Xia Yan and his cohorts.

The first time it was halted was precisely during the period when socialist high tides emerged in China's countryside. In 1955 and 1956, Chairman Mao successively published the report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the preface and postscript to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," which greatly inspired the five hundred million peasants to take the socialist road. Logically, this should have been an excellent opportunity to use newsreels to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the peasants. However, Xia Yan and his gang halted "New Countryside" at this critical moment. Their excuse was that there were difficulties in producing 16mm films. Yet, at this very time, they were mass-producing 16mm films that sang the praises of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, poisoning the peasants.

The second time "New Countryside" was halted was in August 1960. At that time, the countryside was suffering severe natural disasters, and it was precisely when the peasants most needed to be strengthened with Mao Zedong Thought. However, Xia Yan and his gang once again suppressed "New Countryside," which had just been resumed. This time, their excuse was a shortage of film. Yet, during the same period, they were producing anti-Party, anti-socialist poisonous films.

The two instances of suppressing "New Countryside" exposed the anti-Party, anti-socialist intentions of Xia Yan and his gang.

### 夏衍扼杀《新农村》大拍黑影片

    夏衍扼杀《新农村》大拍黑影片
    新闻纪录片本来是党教育几亿农民的一种有效工具。夏衍一伙却竭力反对，拚命扼杀。中央新闻纪录电影制片厂曾经出过专门对农村发行的期刊片《新农村》，两次出片，都被夏衍等人借口停掉。
    第一次恰恰是在我国农村出现社会主义高潮的时期停止出片的。一九五五年和一九五六年，毛主席先后发表了《关于农业合作化问题》的报告和《中国农村的社会主义高潮》的序言和按语，对五亿农民走社会主义道路发生了极大的鼓舞作用。按理说，这正是通过新闻纪录片向农民宣传毛泽东思想的大好时机。可是，夏衍等人偏在这个紧要关头把《新农村》停掉了。他们的借口是缩制十六毫米影片“有困难”。可是，就在这个时候，他们却在大量地缩制歌颂帝王将相、才子佳人的十六毫米影片，向农民大肆放毒。
    第二次停出《新农村》是一九六○年八月。那时正是农村遭受到严重自然灾害的时期，也是最需要对农民加强毛泽东思想宣传的时候。可是，夏衍一伙又把刚恢复不久的《新农村》扼杀了。这一次借口是胶片不足，而在同一个时期，他们却又大拍反党反社会主义的毒草片。
    两次扼杀《新农村》，暴露了夏衍一伙反党反社会主义的祸心。
