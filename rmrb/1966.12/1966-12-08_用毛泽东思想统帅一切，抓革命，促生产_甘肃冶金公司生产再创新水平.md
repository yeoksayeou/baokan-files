The workers of Gansu Metallurgical Company have placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all their work, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, grasping the revolution and promoting production, and achieving victories on both the ideological and material fronts.

This year, on the basis of three consecutive years of full-scale leaps, the company, despite reducing some equipment and personnel, has once again reached new production levels and achieved new successes. The average daily production of mining and ore dressing has increased by more than 14 percent compared to last year, and the production capacity of smelting has increased by one-third. The annual state production plan has been completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled, production costs have continued to decrease, and a number of new products have been successfully trial-produced. In terms of technological innovation, the number of projects and the level of innovation are unprecedented.

In this year's production, the workers, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on liberating the mind and breaking superstitions, have smashed the bourgeois technical "authorities" and broken the foreign frameworks, achieving one victory after another in the field of metallurgical science and technology. For example, in the construction of the secondary air preheating device for large metallurgical furnaces, bourgeois technical "authorities" believed that it would take three years of design, one year of experimentation, and an investment of 300,000 yuan. During the Cultural Revolution, the workers designed it themselves, utilizing all available materials, and used the local method to complete it in just 17 days, with an investment of only 9,000 yuan, and the production effect is very good.

Currently, the various factories and mines of Gansu Metallurgical Company are taking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the guideline, continuing to grasp the revolution and promote production, striving to complete the annual production and savings plan ahead of schedule, and at the same time, doing all the preparatory work to welcome the greater production and construction new high tide in the coming year.

### 用毛泽东思想统帅一切，抓革命，促生产  甘肃冶金公司生产再创新水平

    用毛泽东思想统帅一切，抓革命，促生产
    甘肃冶金公司生产再创新水平
    据新华社兰州六日电  甘肃冶金公司职工把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，抓革命、促生产，取得了精神和物质两条战线上的胜利。
    今年这个公司在连续三年全面跃进的基础上，在减少部分设备和人员的情况下，生产又打出了新水平，创出了新成绩。采矿和选矿的平均日产水平比去年平均提高了百分之十四以上，冶炼的生产能力增长了三分之一。全年国家生产计划已提前超额完成，生产成本继续降低，并且试制成功了一批新产品。在技术革新方面，项目之多，水平之高，都是前所未有的。
    在今年的生产中，职工们按照伟大领袖毛主席关于解放思想、破除迷信的教导，大破资产阶级技术“权威”，大破洋框框，在冶金科学技术领域里，取得了一个又一个的胜利。比如，大型冶金炉二次风预热新装置的建设，资产阶级技术“权威”认为需要设计三年，试验一年，投资三十万元。职工们在文化大革命中，自己动手设计，利用一切可以利用的现有材料，土法上马，只用了十七天时间就搞出来了，投资只花九千元，生产效果很好。
    现在，甘肃冶金公司各厂矿以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，继续抓革命、促生产，力争再提前完成全年的增产节约计划，同时，作好一切准备工作，迎接明年更大的生产建设新高潮。
