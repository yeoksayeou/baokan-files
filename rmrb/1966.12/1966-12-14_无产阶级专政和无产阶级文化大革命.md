We are currently in a new era of world revolution. This is an era where imperialism is heading towards total collapse, and socialism is advancing towards global victory. Sharp class struggles are raging in various forms, both internationally and within individual countries, in capitalist and socialist worlds alike. The struggles among various classes and political forces are extremely complex. Ultimately, the central issue is the question of state power.

Lenin said that the fundamental issue of all revolutions is the question of power. He also said that those who merely acknowledge class struggle are not Marxists; only those who acknowledge both class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat are Marxists.

The dictatorship of the proletariat is the essence of Marxism-Leninism, the fundamental issue of the proletarian revolution, and the guarantee for the proletariat to defeat the bourgeoisie and achieve victory in the socialist cause. For the proletariat, having power means having everything, losing power means losing everything. Throughout the historical period of transition from capitalism to communism, the question of whether or not to have the dictatorship of the proletariat has always been the touchstone for distinguishing Marxist-Leninists from all kinds of revisionists.

New historical experiences of the dictatorship of the proletariat tell us that the question of state power is the fundamental issue of revolution in capitalist countries where the proletariat has not yet seized power, and it remains the fundamental issue of revolution in socialist countries where the proletariat has already seized power. Before the proletariat and revolutionary people seize power, they must adhere to the principle of violent revolution, smash the old state machine, and seize power by force. After the proletariat seizes power, they must carry the socialist revolution to completion, prevent revisionists from usurping the party and the state, prevent capitalist restoration, and defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In the past, people often thought that once the proletariat seized power, the question of power was resolved, and the main task of the revolution was to transform the old economy, organize the new economy, and engage in construction and education. They did not realize that state power could still be seized by the bourgeoisie, that the proletariat could still lose power, and that the dictatorship of the proletariat could still be transformed into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

Due to the betrayal of the Tito clique, Yugoslavia had long since degenerated from a socialist country into a capitalist country. Later, in the homeland of Leninism, the Khrushchev revisionist clique usurped the party and the state, leading the Soviet Union, which had been building socialism for several decades, down the path of capitalist restoration.

This harsh fact cannot but draw the attention of Marxist-Leninists and make them seriously reflect on it.

Comrade Mao Zedong has continuously studied and summarized the experiences and lessons of the socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat in China and internationally. He has proposed a theory about the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society, solving a series of major new problems and developing Marxist-Leninist theory on the dictatorship of the proletariat to a new height.

Comrade Mao Zedong brilliantly applied the dialectical materialism of Marxism-Leninism to socialist society, scientifically analyzing the nature and development laws of contradictions in socialist society.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that socialist society is full of contradictions, with two types of contradictions: those between enemies and those within the people. These two types of contradictions can transform into each other under certain conditions. Recognizing and correctly handling these two types of contradictions is the key to continuously consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and advancing the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that socialist society is still based on class antagonism. Throughout this very long historical period of socialism, there is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. The struggle between the two classes and the two roads is the main contradiction in socialist society and the driving force for its progress.

If the existence of two classes and two roads in socialist countries is not taken seriously and necessary measures are not taken, there is a danger that the dictatorship of the proletariat will degenerate into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and there is a danger of capitalist restoration.

The Soviet revisionist leadership deliberately obscures the fact that contradictions exist in socialist society and denies the existence of classes and class struggle in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev was like this, and his disciples Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Shelest are also like this.

Their theory of a classless and class-struggle-free socialist society is aimed at maintaining the interests of the Soviet revisionist leadership and privileged classes and their reactionary rule over the Soviet people. They deny the existence of classes and class struggle in the Soviet Union precisely as a weapon in their class struggle. In reality, they stand firmly on the side of the bourgeoisie, suppressing the proletariat and waging a ruthless class struggle against the Soviet people. They use the slogan of a "classless" and "class-struggle-free" society as a basis for their so-called "state of the whole people" and "party of the whole people" to deceive the Soviet people and the people of the world, covering up their traitorous behavior of abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have completely betrayed the great Lenin and Stalin. What they fear most is that the Soviet people will rise up to oppose the revisionists and capitalist restoration, wage class struggle against them, overthrow their rule, and restore the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Comrade Mao Zedong often quotes the saying "The tree wants to be still, but the wind will not cease," reminding people that class struggle is an objective existence that does not change with one's subjective will. You want to avoid it, but you can't. If you don't fight them, they will fight you. If you don't destroy them, they will destroy you. Marxist-Leninists must not deny or evade class struggle but should lead the proletariat, according to the laws of class struggle, to guide the struggle on the political, economic, and ideological fronts, carry the socialist revolution to completion, smash the bourgeoisie's plot to restore capitalism, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Currently, our country is undergoing an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to prevent capitalist restoration and further consolidate our country's proletarian dictatorship and socialist system.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong has engaged in a fierce struggle with the bourgeois reactionary line and achieved great victories.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two lines within the party is a reflection of the class struggle in society. The social base of the bourgeois reactionary line is mainly the bourgeoisie. This reactionary line essentially maintains the bourgeoisie. Within the party, it has a certain market, which is those whose bourgeois worldview has not been transformed or has not been thoroughly transformed. A small handful of anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought elements within the party who are taking the capitalist road, along with the ghosts and monsters in society, use this line as their shield and take advantage of the situation to stir up trouble.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the most profound class struggle in history. The struggle between the two lines within the party is also the most profound struggle in the history of our party. A very small number of people who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line have, through various channels, brought the struggle between the two lines within the party to society, intertwining it with the class struggle in society.

With every step forward in the Cultural Revolution, there has been fierce struggle and overcoming various obstacles in society and within the party. Over the past few months, the broad masses of revolutionaries have deeply exposed and criticized the bourgeois reactionary line. This is the largest-scale debate on the question of the two lines. Through this great debate, the broad masses and revolutionary cadres have raised their class consciousness and ideological level, and more consciously support and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Although a very small number of people who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line keep changing their tactics and using new tricks to resist Chairman Mao's correct line, with the irresistible advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mass movement, the bourgeois reactionary line is continually suffering defeat and failure.

In half a year, the torrents of the revolutionary mass movement have washed away all the filth left over from the old society, bringing about a great change in our country. This is a real revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, causing a great upheaval in class relations and touching people's souls. Countless new things have emerged on the horizon, making some people dizzy. However, if one grasps the key issue of the struggle between the two classes and the two roads in socialist society, one can clearly see the great significance and main characteristics of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

First, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a necessary development of domestic class struggle, a necessary development of the socialist revolution, and a new and higher stage of the proletarian revolution.

Our country's proletariat has seized power and, on the economic front, has carried out the socialist revolution, fundamentally changing the capitalist ownership of the means of production. Following this, they smashed the bourgeois rightists' ferocious attacks on the party and socialism, carrying out a socialist revolution on the political front. With the deepening of the socialist revolution and the development of the socialist education movement in cities and countryside across the country, class struggle in the ideological realm has become increasingly prominent.

The overthrown exploiting classes, taking advantage of their still considerable dominance in the ideological and cultural realms, use old ideologies and old habits to corrupt the masses, deceive the masses, bewitch people's minds, expand their territory, and create public opinion for restoration.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that to overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. Revolutionary classes are like this, and counter-revolutionary classes are also like this. Practice has proven that Comrade Mao Zedong's point is completely correct.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is about resolving the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism in the ideological realm.

This is a continuation and development of the struggle between the two classes and the two roads, a new stage of the socialist revolution that is deeper and broader.

Second, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the most extensive, profound, and largest-scale revolutionary mass movement in history.

Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle, a great revolution to transform people's souls and promote the revolutionization of people's thinking. It necessarily touches on all aspects of society's politics, economy, and culture. Such a great revolution can only be carried out deeply, thoroughly, and to the end by relying on the conscious actions of hundreds of millions of people.

The characteristic of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is that Mao Zedong Thought has deeply penetrated people's hearts, truly mobilizing hundreds of millions of people.

The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong is characterized by trusting the masses, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and respecting the masses' spirit of initiative.

The bourgeois reactionary line, on the other hand, opposes the masses, opposes the revolution, and suppresses the revolutionary mass movement.

In the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, the waves of the mass movement have surged higher and higher.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many new things of great historical significance have emerged. The acumen and bravery of proletarian revolutionaries lie in their strong support for these new things as soon as they sprout.

The Red Guards are such a new thing. Under the far-sighted support of Comrade Mao Zedong, a small number of Red Guards quickly developed in schools, factories, and rural areas across the country, becoming a vast revolutionary mass force. They dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to struggle, and dare to make a revolution. They have accomplished great deeds that shake the heavens and earth.

The broad masses of revolutionaries are the masters of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Firmly allowing the masses to educate themselves, liberate themselves, and rise up to make a revolution has resulted in a mighty, irresistible revolutionary mass movement of countless people.

Third, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a struggle to prevent the usurpation of leadership by counter-revolutionary revisionists, a struggle by the proletariat to prevent capitalist restoration.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of people have consciously taken action, thoroughly criticizing and repudiating the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, and establishing new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat. They are changing the spiritual face of the whole society and uprooting the roots of revisionism.

The focus of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is a small handful of party officials who are taking the capitalist road. These bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, government, military, and various fields of culture are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists, Khrushchev-like scoundrels, and time bombs planted within our party. Once the time is ripe, they will explode and launch a Khrushchev-style coup.

In this great revolution, a small handful of party officials who are taking the capitalist road have been submerged in the vast ocean of the mass movement. They have been exposed and fought until they are disgraced. This has powerfully struck at the plot of counter-revolutionary revisionists to carry out capitalist restoration.

Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a life-and-death struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, a struggle between consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat on one hand and turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie on the other. This is an extremely fierce, sharp, and profound class struggle.

Fourth, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has created new experiences in great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat and new experiences in implementing democratic centralism.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great democratic movement under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the Cultural Revolution, our party supports the creative efforts of the broad masses of revolutionaries and supports the revolutionary masses in widely using the forms of great democracy such as great debate, great posters, great criticism, and great linking up. The masses have the right to criticize and make suggestions about the party's policies and the various links of the state machine. Leaders at all levels, regardless of their merits, positions, or seniority, can be criticized by the masses. The power organs leading the cultural revolution are all elected according to the principles of the Paris Commune, implementing a comprehensive electoral system. The masses have the power to recall or replace the elected personnel at any time. Among the masses and between various mass organizations, great democracy should also be implemented, using the methods of great debate, great posters, great criticism, and great linking up to unify thoughts and raise consciousness, grasp Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This great democracy is the best method for the masses to educate themselves.

The great democracy we implement is great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, a truly great proletarian democracy of an unprecedented level in human history, a new development of Chairman Mao's mass line in the socialist revolution.

The historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat tells us that without fully implementing proletarian democracy, it is impossible to have true proletarian centralism. Without great proletarian democracy, it is impossible to achieve a great revolution in people's souls, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to completion, and to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without this great democracy, without hundreds of millions of people caring about state affairs, supervising the party and state organs, and supervising leaders at all levels, it is impossible to prevent counter-revolutionary revisionists from usurping the leadership of the party and state, and it is impossible to prevent the dictatorship of the proletariat from turning into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

At the same time, the dictatorship of the proletariat is the guarantee of great democracy. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, there can be no great democracy of the people. It is precisely because our dictatorship of the proletariat is solid that we dare to and are able to implement such great democracy.

The political situation that Comrade Mao Zedong advocates, which has both concentration and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and individual comfort, is being formed in our country.

Fifth, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has laid the foundation for cultivating and training a contingent of intellectuals from the working class.

Our country already has a group of intellectuals from the working class. However, the work in this area is far from sufficient. Some schools have not yet broken or have not completely broken free from the framework of the capitalist education system. Some positions in the cultural field are not in the hands of the proletariat but in the hands of the bourgeoisie.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses have thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary ideas in the academic, educational, news, literary, and publishing circles, thoroughly changed the phenomenon of reactionary bourgeois "authorities" ruling these positions, and seized and consolidated the leadership of various fields in the cultural realm.

After being tested by the great storms of the revolution, the contingent of intellectuals from the working class is developing and growing. Revolutionary youth and Red Guards are combining with the working and peasant masses and advancing on the road of proletarian revolutionization.

Many revolutionary cadres and revolutionary youth are striving to become reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause according to the five conditions proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

Under the leadership of our party, we will turn the whole country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, and cadres from various departments should all take their own work as the main focus, learn from others, and gradually become cultured laborers with communist consciousness who can both write and fight, and who are both workers and peasants.

Sixth, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "People's social existence determines their thinking. And the correct thinking that represents the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force for transforming society and the world."

Material transforms into spirit, and spirit transforms into material. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is powerfully promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, breaking all unreasonable old frameworks, abolishing all outdated customs, further liberating social productive forces, and further unleashing the enthusiasm and creativity of the working and peasant masses and scientific and technological researchers, creating new favorable conditions for the great development of industry, agriculture, and scientific research.

Under the slogan of "grasp revolution, promote production," the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in factories and rural areas is rising. It can be foreseen that the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and peasants and revolutionary scientific and technological personnel, which has been aroused in the Cultural Revolution, will certainly be used in the struggle for industrial and agricultural production and scientific experiments, leading to a great leap in our country's national economy.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will ensure that our country's construction cause advances in great strides along the socialist and communist path.

Seventh, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also a struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet Communist Party.

A socialist country that adheres to Marxism-Leninism must resolutely oppose imperialism and modern revisionism in the international arena and must resolutely oppose revisionism and "peaceful evolution" at home.

A small handful of party officials in our country who are taking the capitalist road are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Their anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought criminal activities are in response to the class enemies abroad. They actively serve the policy of "peaceful evolution" of imperialism. What they want to do is exactly what Khrushchev has already done in the Soviet Union and what the Soviet revisionist leadership hopes they will do.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has shattered the imperialists' and modern revisionists' illusions of carrying out capitalist restoration in our country, dealing a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country emphasizes proletarian politics and promotes the revolutionization of people's thinking, which is the most fundamental preparation for smashing the aggressive war of American imperialism and its running dogs. The broad revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary youth are an important reserve force for the People's Liberation Army of China.

Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, an unchanging socialist China will more effectively carry out the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet Communist Party, more powerfully support all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world, and better fulfill our glorious internationalist duties of the proletariat.

Eighth, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted the great development of Marxism-Leninism.

The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" formulated under the personal direction of Comrade Mao Zedong, and Comrade Mao Zedong's series of instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are major developments of Marxism-Leninism.

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have always developed in the struggle against domestic and foreign class enemies, in the struggle against various opportunists and revisionists, and in the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology. The thorough criticism of bourgeois ideology by hundreds of millions of people in our country will inevitably bring about the great development of Marxism-Leninism.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country have widely studied and established Mao Zedong Thought, opening a new era for laboring people to directly grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Hundreds of millions of laboring people use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as weapons to observe all problems in the world, to criticize the old world, to struggle, and to make a revolution. This is a great event in the history of the development of Marxism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has been praised by revolutionary people all over the world. The traitors like Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Shelest, together with imperialists like Johnson and Rusk, have cursed it with gnashing teeth. They have mobilized all their propaganda machines, using the most vicious language to launch anti-China hysteria and fiercely attack China's Cultural Revolution. Why are these reactionaries so enraged? It is because the blazing fire of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution cannot but spread to the people of the world, cannot but have a great impact on the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, and cannot but shake and shock the shaky rule of imperialism and modern revisionism. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has sounded the death knell for imperialism and modern revisionism even more loudly.

The new leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique are now bare-chested, tearing off their masks of deception. This further exposes that they are of the same ilk as Khrushchev and even worse than Khrushchev. This will inevitably arouse the Soviet people to further rise up against them. In this way, they themselves will accelerate their march towards the same fate as Khrushchev.

In the history of the development of Marxism, when Marxism was born, when Marxism achieved historic victories and reached a new stage, all the ghosts and monsters in the world would unite to launch a frenzied counterattack.

As soon as Marxism was born in Europe and began to be grasped by the working class, the enemy felt a great threat. At that time, all the reactionary forces in Europe united to form a "Holy Alliance" against Marxism, attempting to drive out the "ghost" that had appeared in Europe. When Marxism developed to the stage of Leninism and achieved the epoch-making victory of the October Revolution, all the imperialist elements who were fighting each other, the "heroes" of the Second International revisionism who served imperialism, the traitors and scabs of various countries, all united to form a "Holy Alliance" against Leninism, ferociously attacking Leninism. Now, Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. The imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party, the reactionaries of various countries, and all the new and old traitors and scabs in the world have all united to form a "Holy Alliance" against Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to resist the spread of Mao Zedong Thought around the world and obstruct the oppressed peoples and nations from grasping Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible ideological weapon.

The "heroes" in history who opposed Marxism, the "heroes" who opposed Leninism, have all been thrown into the garbage heap of history. Now, the "heroes" who oppose Mao Zedong Thought will fail even more miserably. Their clamor is merely the desperate struggle of the dying.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our people are actively responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. Arm the people of our country with Mao Zedong Thought to prevent revisionism, prevent capitalist restoration, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is the most reliable and fundamental guarantee. Arm the Chinese people with Mao Zedong Thought, which also has great significance and far-reaching influence for the international communist movement and the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.

    无产阶级专政和无产阶级文化大革命
    王力　贾一学　李鑫
    我们当前正处在世界革命的一个新时代。这是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的新时代。尖锐的阶级斗争，在国际范围内，在各国范围内，在资本主义世界，在社会主义世界，都以不同的形式炽烈地进行着。各个阶级、各种政治力量的斗争，是十分错综复杂的。斗争的中心问题，归根到底，就是国家政权问题。
    列宁说过，一切革命的根本问题是政权问题。他还说过，谁仅仅承认阶级斗争，那还不是马克思主义者，只有承认阶级斗争同时也承认无产阶级专政的人，才是马克思主义者。
    无产阶级专政，是马克思列宁主义的精髓，是无产阶级革命的根本问题，是保证无产阶级战胜资产阶级，取得社会主义事业胜利的法宝。对于无产阶级说来，有了政权，就有了一切，丧失政权，就丧失一切。从资本主义向共产主义过渡的整个历史时期，要不要无产阶级专政，从来都是识别马克思列宁主义者和形形色色的修正主义者的试金石。
    无产阶级专政的新的历史经验告诉我们，国家政权问题，在无产阶级没有取得政权的资本主义国家，是革命的根本问题，在无产阶级已经取得政权的社会主义国家，仍然是革命的根本问题。在无产阶级和革命人民取得政权以前，要坚持暴力革命的原则，打碎旧的国家机器，武装夺取政权。在无产阶级取得政权以后，要把社会主义革命进行到底，防止修正主义者篡党篡国，防止资本主义复辟，保卫和巩固无产阶级专政。
    过去，人们往往认为，无产阶级在取得政权以后，政权问题就已经解决了，革命的主要任务就是改造旧经济，组织新经济，搞建设，搞教育，没有认识到，国家政权还可以被资产阶级夺过去，无产阶级还可以丧失政权，无产阶级专政还可以变为资产阶级专政。
    由于铁托集团的叛变，南斯拉夫早就由社会主义国家蜕变为资本主义国家。以后，在列宁主义的故乡，又发生了赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡党篡国的事件，使进行了几十年社会主义建设的苏联，走上资本主义复辟的道路。
    这个严酷的事实，不能不引起马克思列宁主义者极大的注意，认真地加以思考。
    毛泽东同志不断地研究和总结了中国的和国际的社会主义革命和无产阶级专政的经验和教训，提出了关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的学说，解决了一系列重大的新问题，把马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的理论发展到一个新的高峰。
    毛泽东同志天才地把马克思列宁主义的唯物辩证法，创造性地运用到社会主义社会，科学地分析了社会主义社会矛盾的性质和发展规律。
    毛泽东同志指出，社会主义社会是存在着矛盾的，存在着敌我之间的和人民内部的两类性质不同的矛盾。这两类性质不同的矛盾在一定条件下是可以转化的。承认这两类矛盾，正确地认识和处理这两类矛盾，才能不断地巩固无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业推向前进。
    毛泽东同志指出，社会主义社会还是建立在阶级对立的基础上的，在整个社会主义这个很长很长的历史时期，贯穿着无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，贯穿着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争。两个阶级和两条道路的斗争是社会主义社会的主要矛盾，是社会主义社会前进的动力。
    社会主义国家存在着两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，如果不引起警惕，不采取必要的措施，也就存在着无产阶级专政蜕变为资产阶级专政的危险，存在着资本主义复辟的危险。
    苏联修正主义领导集团故意抹煞社会主义社会存在着矛盾的事实，矢口否认苏联存在着阶级和阶级斗争。赫鲁晓夫是这样，赫鲁晓夫的门徒勃列日涅夫、柯西金、谢列平也是这样。
    他们这种社会主义社会无矛盾的谬论，是为了维护苏联修正主义领导集团和特权阶层的利益，为了维护他们对苏联人民的反动统治。他们否认苏联存在着阶级和阶级斗争，这正是他们进行阶级斗争的一种武器。实际上，他们自己牢牢地站在资产阶级方面，镇压无产阶级，对苏联人民进行残酷的阶级斗争。他们用没有阶级、没有阶级斗争的说法，作为实行所谓“全民国家”、“全民党”的根据，来欺骗苏联人民和全世界人民，掩盖他们取消无产阶级专政的叛徒行为。他们完全背叛了伟大的列宁和斯大林。他们最害怕的是苏联人民起来造修正主义的反，造资本主义复辟的反，同他们展开阶级斗争，推翻他们的统治，重新建立无产阶级专政。
    毛泽东同志经常引用“树欲静而风不止”这句话，告诉人们，阶级斗争是客观存在，不以人的主观意志为转移。你想避免也避免不了。你不斗他，他要斗你，你不消灭他，他要消灭你。马克思列宁主义者绝不能否认阶级斗争，逃避阶级斗争，而应当领导无产阶级，根据阶级斗争的规律，因势利导，在政治战线、经济战线、思想文化战线上，把社会主义革命进行到底，粉碎资产阶级复辟的阴谋，巩固无产阶级专政。
    当前，我国正在进行的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，正是为了避免资本主义复辟，进一步巩固我国的无产阶级专政和社会主义制度。
    这场无产阶级文化大革命，是毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的。以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同资产阶级反动路线，进行了激烈的斗争，取得了伟大胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，党内两条路线的斗争，是社会上阶级斗争在党内的反映。资产阶级反动路线的社会基础，主要是资产阶级。这条反动路线，实质上是维护资产阶级的。它在党内是有一定市场的，这就是那些资产阶级世界观没有改造或者没有改造好的人。而党内一小撮反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的走资本主义道路的当权派，社会上的牛鬼蛇神，则把这条路线，当作他们的护身符，乘机兴风作浪。
    这次无产阶级文化大革命，是历史上最深刻的阶级斗争。反映在党内的两条路线的斗争，也是在我党历史上最深刻的斗争。极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，通过各种渠道，把党内两条路线的斗争搬到社会上来，同社会上的阶级斗争交织在一起。
    文化大革命每前进一步，都经过激烈的斗争，都经过克服社会上和党内的各种阻力。几个月来，广大革命群众对资产阶级反动路线进行了深刻的揭露和批判。这是一次最大规模的关于两条路线问题的大辩论。通过这场大辩论，使广大群众和革命干部，提高了阶级觉悟和思想水平，更加自觉地拥护和执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。尽管极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，不断变换手法，采取新的花样，来对抗毛主席的正确路线，但是，随着势不可挡的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的向前发展，资产阶级反动路线不断遭到破产和失败。
    在半年的时间里，革命的群众运动的洪流，冲刷着旧社会遗留下来的一切污垢，使我国发生了天翻地覆的大变化。这是无产阶级专政条件下的一场真正的大革命，引起了阶级关系的大变动，触动了人们的灵魂。无数的新事物从地平线上冒出来，使得一些人眼花缭乱。但是，如果掌握社会主义社会两个阶级、两条道路的斗争这个纲，就可以清楚地看到我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和主要特点。
    第一，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是国内阶级斗争的必然发展，是社会主义革命的必然发展，是无产阶级革命的新的高级的阶段。
    我国的无产阶级掌握了政权，在经济战线上进行了社会主义革命，基本上改变了资本主义的生产资料所有制。紧接着，粉碎了资产阶级右派向党向社会主义的猖狂进攻，进行了一场政治战线上的社会主义革命。随着社会主义革命的深入，随着全国城乡社会主义教育运动的开展，意识形态领域里的阶级斗争，日益突出起来了。
    被推翻了的剥削阶级，利用他们还在思想文化领域里占有相当的优势，利用旧的意识形态和旧的习惯势力，来腐蚀群众，欺骗群众，蛊惑人心，扩大阵地，制造复辟的舆论。
    毛泽东同志指出，凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。实践证明，毛泽东同志的这个论断是完全正确的。
    无产阶级文化大革命，就是在意识形态领域里解决社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题。
    这是两个阶级、两条道路斗争的继续和发展，是社会主义革命发展到了一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。
    第二，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是历史上最广泛、最深刻、规模最大的革命的群众运动。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场极其尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，是一场改造人的灵魂，促使人的思想革命化的大革命，必然触及到整个社会的政治、经济和文化的各个领域。这样的大革命，只有依靠亿万群众自觉地行动起来，才能搞深，搞透，搞彻底。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命的特点，就是毛泽东思想深入人心，把亿万群众真正发动起来了。
    以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线，贯穿着信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神。
    而资产阶级反动路线却反对群众，反对革命，反对和压制革命的群众运动。
    同资产阶级反动路线不懈地进行斗争，群众运动的浪潮，就一浪高过一浪。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，涌现出许多具有伟大历史意义的新事物。无产阶级革命家的敏锐和勇敢，就在于当这些新事物刚刚萌芽的时候，给予有力的支持。
    红卫兵，就是这样的新事物。在毛泽东同志高瞻远瞩的支持下，一小批红卫兵迅速地在全国各学校、许多工厂和农村发展起来，成为浩浩荡荡的群众革命队伍。他们敢想，敢说，敢干，敢斗争，敢革命。他们干出了惊天动地的大事。
    广大的革命群众，是无产阶级文化大革命的主人。坚定不移地让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己，自己起来闹革命，就出现了声势浩大的、千军万马的、锐不可挡的革命的群众运动。
    第三，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是防止反革命修正主义篡夺领导的斗争，是无产阶级防止资本主义复辟的斗争。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，亿万群众自觉地行动起来，大破剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，大立无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，正在改变整个社会的精神面貌，正在挖掉修正主义的根子。
    我国这场无产阶级文化大革命打击的重点，就是一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派。这些钻入党里、政府里、军队里和文化领域各界里的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命修正主义分子，是赫鲁晓夫式的坏蛋，是埋在我们党内的定时炸弹。一旦时机成熟，就会爆炸，就会发动赫鲁晓夫式的政变。
    在这场大革命中，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，陷入群众运动的汪洋大海。他们被揭露出来，被斗得威风扫地。这就有力地打击了反革命修正主义分子实行资本主义复辟的阴谋。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是社会主义道路同资本主义道路你死我活的斗争，是一方面要巩固无产阶级专政，另一方面要变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政的斗争。这是一场极其激烈、极其尖锐、极其深刻的阶级斗争。
    第四，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，创造了无产阶级专政制度下的大民主的新经验，创造了实行民主集中制的新经验。
    毛泽东思想是无产阶级文化大革命的行动指南。我国无产阶级文化大革命，是在毛泽东思想统帅下的大民主运动。
    在文化大革命中，我们党支持广大革命群众的创造，支持革命群众广泛采用大鸣，大放，大字报，大辩论，大串连这些大民主的形式。党和国家的各项政策，国家机器的各个环节，群众都有权提出批评和建议。各级领导干部，不管他功劳多大，地位多高，资格多老，群众都可以批评。领导文化革命的权力机构，一律按照巴黎公社的原则，实行全面选举制。群众对被选的人员，有随时改选和撤换的权力。在群众之间，在各个群众组织之间，也要实行大民主，用大鸣，大放，大字报，大辩论的方法来统一认识、统一思想，提高觉悟，掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。这种大民主，是群众自己教育自己的最好方法。
    我们所实行的大民主，是无产阶级专政下的大民主，是人类历史上从来没有过的高度的真正的无产阶级民主，是毛主席的群众路线在社会主义革命中的新发展。
    无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们，如果不充分实行无产阶级的民主制，就不可能有真正的无产阶级的集中制。没有无产阶级的大民主，就不可能实现人们灵魂深处的大革命，就不可能把无产阶级文化大革命搞深搞透，无产阶级专政就不能巩固。没有这种大民主，没有亿万群众关心国家大事，监督党和国家机关，监督各级领导干部，就不能防止反革命修正主义分子篡夺党和国家的领导，就不能防止无产阶级专政演变成资产阶级专政。
    同时，无产阶级专政是大民主的保障。没有无产阶级专政，就不能有人民群众的大民主。正因为我们的无产阶级专政是巩固的，所以敢于和能够实行这样的大民主。
    毛泽东同志倡导的又有集中，又有民主，又有纪律，又有自由，又有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的那样一种政治局面，正在我国形成。
    第五，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，为培养和造就一支工人阶级的知识分子队伍打下了基础。
    我国已经有了一批工人阶级的知识分子。但是，这一方面的工作做得很不够。一些学校，还没有打破或没有完全打破资本主义教育制度的框框。一些文化领域里的阵地，不在无产阶级手里，而在资产阶级手里。
    在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，革命群众彻底批判学术界、教育界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界的资产阶级反动思想，彻底改变反动的资产阶级学术“权威”统治这些阵地的现象，夺取和巩固文化领域各界的领导权。
    经过革命的大风大浪的考验，工人阶级知识分子的队伍正在发展和壮大。革命的青少年和红卫兵，正在同工农群众相结合，正在无产阶级革命化的道路上前进。
    许多革命干部和革命青少年，正在按照毛泽东同志提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件，努力把自己锻炼成为可靠的接班人。
    在我们党的领导下，要把全国办成为一个毛泽东思想的大学校。工、农、兵、学、商和机关干部，都要以本行为主，兼学别样，逐步做到能文能武，亦工亦农，成为有共产主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    第六，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。
    毛泽东同志指出：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”
    物质变精神，精神变物质。无产阶级文化大革命，正在有力地促进人的思想革命化，打破一切不合理的旧框框，废除一切陈规陋习，进一步解放社会生产力，进一步发挥工农群众和科学技术研究人员的积极性和创造性，为工农业和科学研究事业的大发展，创造了新的有利条件。
    在“抓革命，促生产”的口号下，工厂和农村的无产阶级文化大革命，正在兴起。可以预见，广大工农群众和革命的科学技术人员，在文化大革命中发扬起来的冲天的革命干劲，一定会用到工农业生产和科学实验的斗争中去，引起我国国民经济的大飞跃。
    无产阶级文化大革命，将保证我国的建设事业沿着社会主义和共产主义的方向大踏步地前进。
    第七，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，也是一场反对以美国为首的帝国主义和反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争。
    坚持马克思列宁主义的社会主义国家，在国际上坚决反对帝国主义，坚决反对现代修正主义，就必须在国内坚决反对修正主义，坚决反对“和平演变”。
    我们党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是一批反革命的修正主义分子。他们反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动，是同国外阶级敌人互相呼应的。他们积极为帝国主义的“和平演变”政策效劳。他们要做的事情，正是赫鲁晓夫在苏联已经做过的事情，也正是苏联修正主义领导集团希望他们做的事情。
    我国的这场文化大革命，打破了帝国主义和现代修正主义在我国搞资本主义复辟的幻想，这是对帝国主义和现代修正主义的沉重打击。
    我国这场文化大革命，突出无产阶级政治，促进人的思想革命化，是做好粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗侵略战争的最根本的准备。广大的革命的红卫兵和革命的青少年，是中国人民解放军的重要的后备力量。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命，一个永不变色的社会主义中国，将更有效地进行反对以美国为首的帝国主义和反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争，更有力地支援全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，更好地完成我们光荣的无产阶级国际主义义务。
    第八，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，推动了马克思列宁主义的大发展。
    毛泽东同志亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，毛泽东同志关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列指示，是马克思列宁主义的重大发展。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，从来就是在反对国内外阶级敌人的斗争中，在反对形形色色的机会主义、修正主义的斗争中，在破除资产阶级意识形态的斗争中发展起来的。我国亿万群众对资产阶级意识形态的彻底批判，必然带来马克思列宁主义的大发展。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国广大的工农兵群众大学大立毛泽东思想，开辟了劳动人民直接掌握和运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的新纪元。亿万劳动人民用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想作武器，来观察世界上的一切问题，来批判旧世界，来斗争，来革命，这是马克思主义发展史上一件划时代的大事。
    对于我国的无产阶级文化大革命，全世界革命人民，同声赞扬。勃列日涅夫、柯西金、谢列平之流的叛徒，伙同约翰逊、腊斯克之流的帝国主义者，切齿咒骂。他们开动了全部的宣传机器，用最恶毒的语言，掀起了反华歇斯底里，大肆攻击中国的文化大革命。这些反动家伙为什么这样暴跳如雷呢？就是因为中国无产阶级文化革命的燎原大火，不能不传布到世界人民中去，不能不对各国人民的革命斗争发生巨大的影响，不能不冲击和震撼帝国主义和现代修正主义摇摇欲坠的统治。史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，更加响亮地敲起了帝国主义和现代修正主义的丧钟。
    苏联修正主义集团的新头目，现在都赤膊上阵，扯下了骗人的假面具。这就进一步暴露了他们同赫鲁晓夫是一路货，他们比赫鲁晓夫更坏。这就必然激起苏联人民进一步起来反对他们。这样，他们自己就加速地走向赫鲁晓夫那样的结局。
    在马克思主义的发展史上，当马克思主义产生的时候，当马克思主义取得历史性的胜利，提高到一个新阶段的时候，全世界的牛鬼蛇神就要联合起来，进行疯狂的反扑。
    马克思主义刚在欧洲诞生，并开始被工人阶级所掌握的时候，敌人就感到了巨大的威胁。当时，欧洲一切反动势力，都联合起来，结成反马克思主义的“神圣同盟”，妄图驱逐这个在欧洲出现的“幽灵”。当马克思主义发展到列宁主义阶段，并取得十月革命划时代胜利的时候，正在互相厮杀的一切帝国主义分子，为帝国主义效劳的第二国际修正主义“英雄”们，各国的工贼和叛徒们，又都联合起来，结成反列宁主义的“神圣同盟”，张牙舞爪地对列宁主义进行围攻。现在，毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。以美国为首的帝国主义者，以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者，世界各国的反动派，一切新老工贼和叛徒们，又都联合起来，拼凑反对毛泽东思想的“神圣同盟”，妄图抵制毛泽东思想在全世界的传播，妄图阻挠被压迫人民和被压迫民族掌握毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的思想武器。
    历史上反对马克思主义的“英雄好汉”们，反对列宁主义的“英雄好汉”们，一个个的都被抛进了历史的垃圾堆。现在反对毛泽东思想的“英雄好汉”们，将失败得更惨。他们的叫嚣，只不过是垂死的疯狂挣扎罢了。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国人民积极响应林彪同志的号召，正在把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的阶段。用毛泽东思想武装我国人民，是防止修正主义，防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政的最可靠最根本的保证。用毛泽东思想武装中国人民，对于国际共产主义运动，对于全世界人民的革命事业，也具有伟大的意义和深远的影响。
