The people of the entire nation, with surging waves of indignation, have held massive protest meetings and demonstrations, expressing the strongest condemnation of the U.S. imperialists' frenzied bombing of Hanoi and our embassy, and angrily denouncing the traitorous actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique.

Chairman Mao said: "People who have already won revolutionary victories should support the struggles of those who are fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 19th, the people of the entire nation, with surging waves of indignation, have held massive protest meetings and demonstrations, expressing the strongest condemnation of the U.S. imperialists' frenzied bombing of Hanoi and our embassy, and angrily denouncing the traitorous actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique.

People from all over the country have expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "People who have already won revolutionary victories should support the struggles of those who are fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." They believe that as long as the people of the world unite, fight bravely, and advance fearlessly, they will definitely be able to defeat the American aggressors and all their lackeys! They will definitely be able to annihilate all the devils!

In many cities in the south and north, people braved heavy rain and severe cold to hold powerful demonstrations. Millions of Red Guards in various places have expressed that the U.S. and its accomplices are the sworn enemies of the Red Guards, and they will definitely annihilate all the devils to create a new world. The People's Liberation Army, on high alert, has expressed its determination to be a hundred times more vigilant and ready to smash any sudden attacks by the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices.

In recent days, tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people in cities such as Kunming, Nanning, Changsha, Fuzhou, Wuhan, Hohhot, Urumqi, and Hangzhou have held meetings and demonstrations. The demonstrators said that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have unleashed an irresistible fighting spirit and revolutionary zeal during the Cultural Revolution, which is the fundamental guarantee for supporting the Vietnamese people and opposing the U.S. imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression. The tens of thousands of demonstrators in Kunming also went to the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's consulate in Kunming to express their support and handed over a large number of support letters. After the demonstration and parade in Fuzhou on the 17th, more than fifty thousand revolutionary masses and Red Guards took to the streets again on the 18th. In Changsha, ten thousand revolutionary masses and Red Guards held a grand meeting and parade, angrily denouncing the U.S.'s heinous crimes and expressing their firm resolve to support Vietnam and resist America. In Urumqi, people of various ethnic groups marched through the snow. Some ethnic minority steelworkers and Red Guard fighters angrily denounced the Soviet revisionist leadership clique's collusion with the U.S. imperialists, serving the U.S.'s "bombing to force negotiations" plot, and exposing their traitorous faces. They expressed their determination to be brave anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist fighters, ready to rush to the front lines against America at any time, and fight to the end with the U.S. and its lackeys.

In places such as Changchun, Harbin, Jinan, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Nanjing, Xining, Guiyang, Lhasa, and Yinchuan, the masses have expressed that to do a good job in preparing for war, they will further launch a new high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works, study the "Three Articles," carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, and strive for victory in both revolution and production. The activists studying Chairman Mao's works who are exchanging learning experiences in Changchun have strongly denounced the U.S.'s new crimes in Vietnam, expressing their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, promote revolution and production, and fight to the end with the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists. The revolutionary masses in the Hefei region of Anhui Province braved the rain to demonstrate and march. Many militia members also studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again, expressing their determination to learn from Bethune's internationalist spirit, ready to fight alongside the Vietnamese people at any time to defeat the American bandits. The entire militia of the Dazhai Brigade in Shanxi Province angrily denounced the U.S.'s aggressive crimes. They expressed their determination to remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, hold a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, practice labor and military integration, and be ready at any time to defeat the American aggressors.

Many Red Guards and revolutionary students' Long March teams, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "pay attention to state affairs," heard the news of the U.S. bombing Hanoi while on their Long March, and were filled with indignation. They conducted propaganda along the way and held denunciation meetings. Long March teams passing through Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces all expressed their determination to strengthen training, enhance the concept of preparedness, and be ready to rush to the front lines of resisting America at any time. Eight Long March teams of Red Guards passing through Dayu County, Jiangxi Province, braved the rain to hold a denunciation meeting with local masses. The young revolutionaries expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "the whole party must pay attention to war, study military affairs, and prepare for war," to temper their feet into iron during the Long March, to temper their hearts to be red and their wills to be firm, to temper a life philosophy of living and dying for the revolution, and to contribute everything to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and the people of the world. Eighty-two Long March teams from Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning, Gansu, Shandong, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, totaling more than a thousand young revolutionaries, did not even have time to shake off the dust of their journey before they jointly held a denunciation meeting. They angrily said: The U.S. imperialists are so brazen in bullying us, we revolutionary students and Red Guards will never agree to it! These eighty-two Long March teams collectively passed a resolution to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao at the meeting, expressing their determination to firmly respond to Comrade Lin Biao's great call, to strive to study the "Three Articles" on the revolutionary Long March, and to complete this task as the greatest preparedness task. These young revolutionaries declared: We will definitely bury imperialism in this generation! We will fight for a bright red new world!
