The people of Shiqiujie often say: "The sun can only shine on the ground, but the golden light of Mao Zedong Thought can illuminate our hearts and make the mine shaft bright." Indeed, it is because of Mao Zedong Thought that we have today's Shiqiujie and today's Wang Zhenjiang. I often think: What do I, Wang Zhenjiang, have that is not given by the Party and Chairman Mao! I must listen to Chairman Mao's words and dedicate my life to the revolution. Even if it means climbing a mountain of knives or descending into a sea of fire, breaking my head and bones, I will throw myself into it.

	To do revolution, one must have a fighting spirit

Chairman Mao said: "We not only know how to destroy an old world, we will also know how to build a new world." He also said: "All the people of the world must have the courage to fight, dare to struggle, not fear difficulties, and advance fearlessly. Then, the whole world will definitely belong to the people."

These words are right on the mark. Doing revolution is about struggle. Struggle against class enemies, struggle against nature, struggle against various erroneous thoughts. Without struggle, we cannot eliminate the bourgeoisie and establish communism, and we cannot achieve victory. We struggled against imperialism and capitalists and took back Shiqiujie; but we must continue to struggle, to build it into a socialist new coal mine, to make it "completely" and "thoroughly" serve socialism and the people.

In 1961, the Party Committee decided to mine the coal field to the southwest. The main tunnel excavation required passing through the old mining area that had been mined before liberation, and the working conditions were extremely difficult. Above the head were three intersecting old tunnels, and the working site was a large cavity nine meters high and ten meters wide; the roof rock was gnashing its teeth, and the coal walls on all sides occasionally emitted the sound of falling coal. The mine leadership decided to assign part of our team to help complete this project. I convened a meeting with everyone, explained the significance of the southwest main tunnel excavation, and laid out all the favorable and unfavorable conditions, letting everyone discuss. Comrades unanimously said: "Excavating the southwest main tunnel is directly related to the lifespan of our mine. Building a mine is not easy! We cannot just let these hundreds of millions of tons of coal lie idle underground. There are many difficulties, but the martyrs did not fear bloodshed and sacrifice for the revolutionary cause, so why should we fear difficulties when we are building?" The excavation began, and one problem after another came up. To set up pillars, there was no wood long enough, and even if there was, it couldn't be transported down; to set up a canopy, it wouldn't work. We worked for three or four days, but the progress was not great. This made me so anxious that I couldn't eat or sleep. I thought, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we proletarians were able to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and defeat imperialism. Could we really give up in the face of this tunnel? No, a million times no! Chairman Mao teaches us: "In times of difficulty, we must see achievements, see the light, and raise our courage." The southwest main tunnel is related to the lifespan of our mine for more than ten years. No matter what, we must fight to the end!

I and everyone studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," taking Zhang Side and the "Foolish Old Man" as examples, and decided to advance in the face of difficulties. Practice creates experience, and we finally created the "short wood digging groove inclined roof method" through continuous exploration, solving the key problem of advancing. The more we fought, the higher the morale, the more methods we had, and the faster the excavation progressed. To ensure safe passage through the "danger zone," I stayed on duty at the workface for three consecutive days and nights. Was I tired? Sometimes I felt tired. But as soon as I thought of the miserable life in the old society and the fact that two-thirds of the laboring people in the world were suffering, and then thought of Chairman Mao's teaching of "firmly resolve, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," my tiredness disappeared, and my energy came back, and this energy is inexhaustible. I feel that doing revolution must have a fighting spirit. Without a revolutionary fighting spirit, we cannot achieve socialism and communism. Over the years, it is with this fearless revolutionary fighting spirit that we have become stronger and stronger. Big difficulties and big tests, small difficulties and small tests, tempering thoughts and styles in struggle, producing talents and achievements. We have successively mined 36 working faces, overcoming various difficulties such as small pit destruction, roof collapse, and fault water inrush, and achieved one victory after another.

	To do revolution, one must be bold and meticulous

I like to fight hard battles. Wherever it is most dangerous, I run there. Some comrades advised me to be more stable and not to take risks. I thought, in the past, when we worked for imperialists and capitalists, there was not even a bit of safety equipment down there. Now we are working for ourselves, the roof and coal walls are managed so well, and there are good ventilation facilities. If we don't throw ourselves into it and work hard, how can we explain it?

Once, a small group was pulling out pillars. They pulled out three, and saw that the large pieces of rock on the roof were all gaping open. The young technician, Xie Shuangui, knew that he could not hesitate any longer and had to go forward to pull it back. I went over and carefully checked the changes in the roof rock, said "Let me do it," and jumped into the old pit, quickly pulling out the wooden pillar. Soon, there was a "crash" sound, and a large piece of the roof collapsed. Perhaps someone would say, is this a bit risky? In fact, it is not risky at all. As long as the conditions of the roof and coal walls are diagnosed thoroughly, and detailed investigation and research work is done, it is not risky. Everything has its regularity. A house collapses and must first scatter soil; coal walls collapse, and the roof collapses, all have omens. As long as one is bold and meticulous, there will be no mistakes. In fact, the more one fears, the more likely one is to make mistakes; the bolder one is, the more meticulous one is, the more concentrated one's spirit is, and the more skillful one's operation is, the less likely one is to make mistakes. Of course, there are situations where we need to pull teeth from a tiger's mouth. This requires courage. Revolutionary courage comes from unlimited loyalty to the Party, to the people, and to socialist construction, and from Chairman Mao's great teaching of "in strategy, we must despise all enemies, and in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously." Once, a small roof collapse occurred at the working face, instantly pressing down a coal conveyor. This made everyone anxious. After the roof stabilized, I and a few comrades went to rescue it. Was it dangerous? Yes, it was. If not handled properly, we would all be in trouble. But this is state property, and we must think of a way to rescue it.

I feel: taking a bit of risk is a small matter, not mining coal and affecting socialist construction is a big matter. Just having a cautious mind is not enough, one must stand in Shiqiujie, see all of China, and see the whole world.

	To do revolution, one must not calculate personal gains

The Party Committee decided to reform the coal mining method, changing from full-height mining to layered mining. We all strongly supported this. However, there were a few people who, from their own personal calculations, thought that although the recovery rate increased, the efficiency would decrease and the cost would increase. I do not think this way. Changing to layered mining, it is true that the working face will relatively require more people, and the consumption of pit props and auxiliary materials will also increase. However, as long as we innovate technology, the problem can be solved. Implementing layered mining can increase the resource recovery rate from the original 50% to more than 75%, and the mine's lifespan can be extended by at least 11 or 12 years. This calculation is definitely worthwhile. In the old society, capitalists, for the sake of profit, mined recklessly, destroying countless resources. Now, the mine is ours, and seeing piece after piece of coal being wasted, how can we not feel heartbroken! Layered mining is more labor-intensive and tiring than full-height mining, but compared to the past when we worked under a small oil lamp for 15 or 16 hours a day and couldn't earn a pound of sorghum flour, it is truly incomparable. Some people worry that if layered mining does not complete the task and does not reach the quota, the red flag will be lost, and the over-fulfillment bonus will not be considered. But I think, our bonus is not three or five yuan, it is "seven hundred million," and this value is very great. Working for the bonus is not a purely communist-moral person. We workers do not work for the bonus. If we do not build socialism well, we will not be able to keep our capital, let alone talk about anything else!

Calculating gains requires positioning, and I think carrying the red flag also requires a standpoint. If the calculation is misplaced, it cannot be done; if the standpoint for carrying the red flag is low, it cannot be held high. Should we calculate gains? Yes, we should. Putting the interests of the Party and the people first, calculating revolutionary gains, calculating the country's big gains, the calculation is correct; only calculating personal small gains, breaking the big calculation, three yuan and seven hundred million, will never add up. Should we carry the red flag? Yes, we should. But for a revolutionary, it is not a matter of "protecting" the red flag, but a matter of holding the revolutionary red flag high, continuously revolutionizing, and advancing.

Things are always like this: only with revolutionary thoughts can there be revolutionary actions. As long as one puts "me" aside and puts "public" first, no matter in what situation, one can be very self-aware and very firm, charge forward, and advance bravely, not for fame, not for profit, and wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people.

	Being a revolutionary cadre means setting an example

After becoming the team leader, I, like before, work day and night with the workers. If a worker is sick, I send him food. If a new worker comes, I ask about his well-being. If a comrade has a knot in his mind, I help him untie it. Doing this, I can timely understand the workers' situation, listen to the masses' opinions, and also facilitate accepting the masses' supervision, making myself always stand among the masses, always maintaining the character of a laboring people, and being an ordinary laborer.

The cadres of Shiqiujie Coal Mine have the experience of: "Three days without going down the mine, speaking with a weak back." Practice has made me deeply realize: the actions of cadres have a great influence on everyone. Just take this January as an example. At that time, the working face cycle was a bit tense, and my toothache also flared up, making my face swollen like a big fat person, and speaking was very difficult. In this situation where I couldn't sleep or eat, I still insisted on working and directing production. Comrades all advised me to rest, and I said: "Everyone is working hard underground, how can I sit still upstairs?" I worked with energy, and comrades worked with even more energy.

I have strict requirements for myself and also have strict requirements for comrades. I feel that as a team leader, one should care about the masses' lives, pay attention to work methods, and more importantly, have strict requirements for comrades in work. This is being responsible to the Party, and at the same time, it is also being responsible to comrades. Only by being strict can we bring up good successors, produce heroes and good men; only by being strict can we temper people, temper thoughts, and temper styles.

Chairman Mao teaches us: cadres should care about every soldier, not be selfish, not seek enjoyment, be selfless, and care about others more than oneself. I think, being a cadre means putting one's heart on "public." In a previous period, my wife complained that the house was too narrow and wanted me to talk to the leadership to adjust it. I said: "In the old society, you and I were both poor. Now we are building socialism, and Chairman Mao teaches us to build the country with thrift and struggle hard. How can we pursue personal enjoyment?"

Being a revolutionary cadre means strictly requiring oneself in everything and setting an example. The Party has entrusted us with more than a hundred people, and we should give everything to the Party and to everyone. The leader should be a model for the masses and a pioneer of the revolution in everything.

    在革命斗争中炼思想、炼作风
    石圪节煤矿五零一采煤队队长　王振江
    我们石圪节人常说：
  “太阳只能照在地面上，毛泽东思想的金光才能把我们心里照亮，才能把矿井底下照得亮堂堂。”的确，有了毛泽东思想，才有了今天的石圪节，才有了今天的王振江。我常想：我王振江浑身上下那一点不是党和毛主席给的！我一定要听毛主席的话，干一辈子革命，就是上刀山，下火海，砸头断骨，也要扑着身子去干。
          干革命就得有股斗劲
    毛主席说：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”还说：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。”
    这话正说在咱心坎上。干革命就是斗争。跟阶级敌人斗，跟自然斗，跟各种错误思想斗，不斗就不能灭资兴无，就不能取得胜利。我们跟帝国主义斗，跟资本家斗，夺回了石圪节；但还得斗下去，把它建设成为一座社会主义的新煤矿，让它“完全”“彻底”地为社会主义、为人民服务。
    一九六一年，党委决定开采矿井西南方向的煤田。大巷掘进，需要通过解放前采过的旧采区，工作条件十分艰难。头顶上是三条旧巷道的交叉点，工作地点又是九米多高、十米多宽的大空洞；顶板岩石呲牙咧嘴，四处煤壁不时发出煤块下落的声音。矿领导决定抽调我队一部分人去帮助完成这项工程。我召集大家先开了个会，说明西南大巷发碹的意义，并把各种有利条件和不利条件摆出来，让大家讨论。同志们一致表示：“发碹西南大巷，是直接关系着咱们矿井寿命的问题。国家建设一个矿井可不容易啊！咱可不能眼看着这几百万吨煤炭扔在底下不管。困难是很多的，可是烈士们为了革命事业流血牺牲都不怕，我们搞建设遇到点困难怕什么？”发碹开始了，难题也一个接一个地来了。打柱吧，没有那么长的木料，即便有也运不下来；架棚吧，起不了作用。一连干了三、四天，进展不大。这一来，急得我吃不下饭，睡不着觉。心想，在党和毛主席领导下，我们无产阶级起来能把国民党的反动统治推翻，能把帝国主义打败，难道我们在这个巷道面前就服输了吗？不能，一万个不能！毛主席教导咱：“在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”西南大巷关系着我们矿井十几年的寿命问题，说什么也得斗到底！
    我和大家一块学习《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》，以张思德和“老愚公”为榜样，决心迎着困难前进。实践出经验，我们终于在不断摸索中创造了“短木挖槽斜顶法”，解决了前进中的关键问题。大家越斗情绪越高，越斗办法越多，砌碹进展大大加快。为了确保安全地通过“危险区”，我连续三天三夜坚守在工作面。累不累？有时也感到累。可是我一想起旧社会的悲惨生活，一想起世界上还有三分之二的劳动人民受苦受难，再想想毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，我的累就跑了，劲就来了，这股劲永远也使不尽。我觉得，干革命就得有股斗劲。没有革命的斗劲，就不能实现社会主义和共产主义。几年来，我们就是凭着这股天不怕地不怕的革命斗劲，越斗腰板越硬朗。大困难大考验，小困难小考验，在斗争中炼思想，炼作风，出人才，出成果。我们先后采过了三十六个工作面，克服了小窑破坏、顶板破碎、断层透水等种种困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
          干革命就要胆大心细
    我喜欢打硬仗。哪里最艰险，我就往哪里跑。有的同志劝我稳一些，不要瞎冒险。我想，过去给帝国主义、资本家干活，那时下面一点安全设施也没有。现在给自己干，顶棚、煤帮管理得这样好，又有良好的人工通风等设施，不扑上身子好好干，咋说得过去哪！
    有一次，一个小组正在回柱子。他们拉倒了三根，看见顶棚上大块的石头都是张嘴露豁的，青年技术员谢栓贵知道再不能迟疑了，要上前拖回来。我过去仔细检查了顶板岩石的变化情况，说了声“让我来”，便纵身跳进了老塘，迅速把木柱拖了出来。不一会，只听得“哗啦”一声，顶板塌下了一大片。也许有人说，这是不是有点冒险？其实，一点也不冒险。只要把顶和帮的各种情况诊断透，做好细致的调查研究工作，就不是冒险。什么事物都有它的规律性。房屋倒塌总要先撒土；煤帮卧，顶板塌，也都有预兆。只要胆大心细，就不会出漏子。事实倒是越害怕，越容易出漏子；胆越壮，心越细，精神贯注，操作麻利，就不会出漏子。当然，需要我们在老虎嘴里拔牙的情况，也是有的。这就需要有胆略。革命的胆略来自对党、对人民、对社会主义建设事业的无限忠诚，来自毛主席的
  “在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的伟大教导。有一次，工作面发生了小冒顶，一下子压住了一部煤溜。这可把人急坏了。等顶板稳住，我和几个同志就去抢救。危险不危险？危险。招架不好，就都上不来了。可是这是国家的财产，说啥也得想办法抢救出来。
    我觉得：咱担点风险是小事，出不了煤，影响社会主义建设是大事。光有小心眼不行，要站在石圪节，看到全中国，看到全世界。
        干革命决不能打个人的小算盘
    党委决定改革采煤方法，由一次采全高改为分层开采。我们大家都十分拥护。可是也有个别人，从自己的小算盘出发，认为这样虽然回收率提高了，但效率会降低，成本会提高。我不这样打算盘。改为分层开采，固然工作面用人相对地是要多些，坑木和辅助材料的消耗也要多些。但是只要我们革新技术，问题是可以解决的。实行分层开采，资源回收率就能由原来的百分之五十提高到百分之七十五以上，矿井寿命至少可以延长十一、二年。这笔账咋算也划得来。在旧社会，资本家为了挣钱，乱挖乱采，不知破坏了多少资源。现在，矿山是咱们的，眼看着一片片的煤炭白白丢掉，怎能不觉得心痛！分层开采比一次采全高，干活既重又累，但是，要比起过去顶上个小油灯，一天干十五六个小时，挣不上一斤高粱面的那种情景，真不知强了多少倍。有的人担心，分层开采如果完不成任务，达不到定额，红旗丢了，超额奖也不用想得了。但是我想，咱的奖金不是三块五块，是“七亿”，这个价值大得很。为奖金干，那不能算是一个纯粹的具有共产主义道德的人。咱工人阶级才不为着奖金干哩。建设不好社会主义，咱的老本还保不住，那里还谈得上别的！
    打算盘讲究定位，我看扛红旗也得讲究立足点。算盘定错了位打不成，扛红旗立足点站低了举不高。算盘要不要打？要打。把党和人民的利益放在第一位，打革命的算盘，打国家的大算盘，算盘就打对了；光打个人的小算盘，砸了大算盘，三块钱和七亿人，啥时候也加不到一起。红旗要不要？要。但对于一个革命者来说，决不是什么“保”红旗的问题，而是要把革命的红旗高高举起，不断革命，不断前进的问题。
    事情总是这样，有了革命的思想，才能有革命的行动。一个人只要“我”字让了位，“公”字当了头，不论在什么样的情况下，都能十分自觉，十分坚定，冲锋陷阵，勇往直前，不为名，不为利，一心一意为革命，全心全意为人民。
          当革命干部就得以身作则
    我当了队长以后，和过去一样，每天没明没黑，同工人滚在一起。有的工人病了，我给他送饭。新工人来了，我问寒问暖。有的同志思想上有疙瘩，我帮他解一解。这样做，既能及时了解工人的情况，倾听群众的意见，又便于接受群众的监督，使自己永远站在群众当中，永远保持劳动人民的本色，当一个普通劳动者。
    我们石圪节煤矿干部对参加劳动的体会是：“三天不下井，说话腰不硬”。实践使我深深体会到：干部的一举一动对大家有很大影响。就拿今年一月份来说吧，当时工作面循环有些紧张，刚好我的牙疼病又犯了，脸肿得像个大胖子，说话很吃力。就在这觉不能睡、饭不能吃的情况下，我仍然坚持一边劳动、一边指挥生产。同志们都劝我休息，我说：“大家在井下苦战，我怎能在上面坐得住呢？”我干得有劲，同志们比我干得更有劲。
    我对自己要求严格，对同志们要求也严格。我觉得，作为一个队长，应当关心群众生活，注意工作方法，更应当在工作上对同志们要求严格。这是对党负责，同时也是对同志们负责。严，才能带出好的接班人，才能出英雄，出好汉；严，才能锻炼人，锻炼思想，锻炼作风。
    毛主席教导我们：干部要关心每一个战士，不自私自利，不贪图享受，克己奉公，关心他人胜过自己。我想，当干部就得把心操在“公”字上。前一个时期，我爱人嫌房子住得窄，要我向领导同志说说，调整一下。我说：“旧社会你我都是穷得当当响。现在咱们进行社会主义建设，毛主席教导咱勤俭建国，艰苦奋斗。咱怎么能去追求个人享受呢？”
    当个革命干部，就得处处事事严格要求自己，以身作则。党把一百几十来号人交给咱，咱就应该把自己的一切交给党，交给大家。领头人就应该处处是群众的表率，革命的先锋。
