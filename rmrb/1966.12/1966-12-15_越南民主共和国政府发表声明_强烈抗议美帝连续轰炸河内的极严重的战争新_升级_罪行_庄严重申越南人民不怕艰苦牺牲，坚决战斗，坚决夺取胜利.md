The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on December 14, strongly protesting the barbaric crimes of U.S. aggressor planes continuously bombing the capital city of Hanoi of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The statement pointed out that this is an extremely serious new "escalation" of the U.S. imperialists in strengthening and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. The statement reaffirms: The Vietnamese people are not afraid of hardships and sacrifices, will definitely fight resolutely, and will definitely win victory, and will certainly win.

The full text of the statement is as follows:

On December 13 and 14, 1966, the United States sent multiple batches of planes to bomb and strafe various places in and around the city of Hanoi, including the area of foreign embassies, killing and injuring more than 100 people and destroying many buildings.

In this way, in the past approximately ten days, the U.S. aggressors have attacked the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam four times. This is an extremely serious new "escalation" in the U.S. imperialists' strengthening and expanding of the war of aggression against Vietnam. This is an extremely arrogant provocation against all socialist countries, all national independence countries, and all peace-loving and justice-seeking peoples of the world.

Recently, the U.S. authorities have been shouting about new deceitful arguments regarding "peace talks." However, the crazy bombing and strafing of Hanoi by U.S. planes have exposed their attempt to cover up their heinous war of aggression and new "escalation."

The U.S. authorities think that they can shake the Vietnamese people's resolve to resist U.S. aggression and save the country, force the Vietnamese people to surrender, and desperately try to reverse the heavy defeats suffered by the U.S. expeditionary forces in South Vietnam, especially at the beginning of this dry season. But they are greatly mistaken.

The Vietnamese people are fighting against U.S. imperialist aggressors, defending the independence and freedom of their homeland, and defending peace in Asia and the world. The Vietnamese people are not afraid of hardships and sacrifices, will definitely fight resolutely, and will definitely win victory, and will certainly win. More than 1,600 U.S. planes and many U.S. air pirates have been shot down and captured in the North, which is the deserved punishment given to the U.S. aggressors by the people of the capital and the North.

The peoples of the world are extremely indignant at the U.S. imperialists' aggression against the Vietnamese people, and even more indignant at their bombing and strafing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The peoples of the world will further strengthen their solidarity with the Vietnamese people and will not forgive the U.S. aggressors' acts of aggression.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly protests to international public opinion the above-mentioned blatant and heinous acts of aggression by the U.S. government; firmly demands that the U.S. government must immediately stop bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; withdraw all U.S. troops and their puppet troops from South Vietnam, and dismantle all U.S. military bases in South Vietnam; and fully respect the basic national rights of the Vietnamese people recognized in the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Vietnam issue.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sternly warns the U.S. government: It must take full responsibility for all consequences arising from its bombing and strafing of the capital city of Hanoi and the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam calls on all socialist brother countries, all national independence countries, and all peace-loving and justice-seeking peoples of the world, including the American people, to take timely action, more strongly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people, severely condemn the U.S. war of aggression, and firmly demand that it must stop this heinous war.

Compatriots and soldiers throughout the country!

The more the U.S. aggressors approach defeat, the more crazy and adventurous they become. The compatriots throughout the country have already and are turning Chairman Ho's sacred call to resist U.S. aggression and save the country, issued on July 17, 1966, into strength, giving the U.S. aggressors heavy blows, and achieving great victories in battle and production. Facing the U.S. aggressors' barbaric attack on the capital city of Hanoi, the military and people of the North and South, and the military and people of the capital, must further deepen their hatred, strengthen their unity, advance bravely, and decisively defeat and win against the U.S. aggressors, completing the glorious national task.

U.S. imperialism will surely be defeated!

The Vietnamese people will surely win!

December 14, 1966, in Hanoi

    越南民主共和国政府发表声明
    强烈抗议美帝连续轰炸河内的极严重的战争新“升级”罪行
    庄严重申越南人民不怕艰苦牺牲，坚决战斗，坚决夺取胜利
    新华社河内十四日电　越南民主共和国政府十四日发表声明，强烈抗议美国强盗飞机连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市的野蛮罪行。声明指出，这是美帝国主义在加强和扩大侵越战争中进行的极其严重的新“升级”。声明重申：越南人民不怕艰苦、牺牲，一定坚决战斗，坚决夺取胜利，而且必定胜利。声明全文如下：
    美国接连在一九六六年十二月十三日和十四日两天，派遣多批飞机，轰炸、扫射包括外国使馆区在内的河内市区和郊区的一些地方，炸死炸伤一百人以上，炸毁房屋多幢。
    这样，在过去约十天内，美国侵略者四次袭击越南民主共和国首都。这是美帝国主义在加强和扩大侵略越南战争中进行的极其严重的新“升级”。这是对各个社会主义国家、各个民族主义国家，以及全世界一切爱好和平和主持正义的人民的极其蛮横的挑衅。
    最近，美国当局叫嚷关于“和平谈判”的新狡诈论调。但是，美国飞机对河内的疯狂轰炸和扫射，赤裸裸地暴露了它企图掩盖罪恶滔天的侵略战争的新“升级”的骗人手段。
    美国当局以为用炸弹可以动摇越南人民抗美救国的决心，迫使越南人民投降，妄图挽救美国远征军在越南南方，尤其是在今年旱季初期遭到严重失败以后的惨重败局。但是，它大错特错了。
    越南人民正在进行反对美帝国主义侵略者，保卫祖国的独立和自由，保卫亚洲和世界和平的战斗。越南人民不怕艰苦、牺牲，一定坚决战斗，坚决夺取胜利，而且必定胜利。一千六百多架美国飞机和许多美国飞贼在北方被击落和活捉，是首都人民和北方人民给予美国侵略者的应有惩罚。
    世界人民对美帝国主义对越南人民的侵略，表示极大的愤慨，而对它轰炸、扫射越南民主共和国首都，表示更大的愤慨。世界人民将进一步加强同越南人民的团结，决不饶恕美国强盗的侵略行动。
    越南民主共和国政府向国际舆论强烈控诉美国政府的上述明目张胆和罪恶滔天的侵略行动；坚决要求美国政府必须立即停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动；把美国军队和它的帮凶军全部撤出越南南方、撤销在越南南方的各个美国军事基地；彻底尊重一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议所承认的越南人民的各种基本民族权利。
  越南民主共和国政府严厉警告美国政府：它必须对由于它在轰炸、扫射越南民主共和国首都河内和越南民主共和国领土而引起的一切后果，承担全部责任。
    越南民主共和国政府呼吁各个社会主义兄弟国家、各个民族主义国家和包括美国人民在内的全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人民，必须及时采取行动，更有力地支持越南人民的正义斗争，严厉谴责美国的侵略战争，坚决要求它必须停止这一场罪恶滔天的战争。
    全国同胞和战士们！
    美国侵略强盗越接近失败，就越疯狂和冒险。全国同胞已经和正在把胡主席一九六六年七月十七日的抗美救国神圣号召化为力量，给予美国强盗沉重的反击，在战斗和生产中取得了巨大的胜利。面对着美国强盗野蛮袭击首都河内市的滔天罪行，全国北南两方军民，首都军民，要进一步加深仇恨，加强团结，英勇前进，决战决胜美国侵略强盗，完成民族的光荣任务。
    美帝国主义必败！
    越南人民必胜！
                一九六六年十二月十四日于河内
