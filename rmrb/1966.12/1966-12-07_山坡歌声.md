The "Red East Long March Team" during their long march, placed the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought in the first position, and whenever there was an opportunity, they propagated it. Whenever they arrived at a place, they would often not even put down their backpacks or let their sweat dry before propagating Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "To propagate Mao Zedong Thought, we are not afraid of hard work!" They took advantage of the time before mass meetings, before showing films, and during labor rest periods to read the "Sixteen Points," teach songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, and perform short, concise programs, which were very popular with the masses. They propagated regardless of whether there were many or few people, saying, "If one more person grasps Mao Zedong Thought, it will add one more bit of strength to the revolution."

Once, the young revolutionaries came to a valley not far from Pingxing Pass and saw an old man in his sixties herding livestock on a hillside. The young revolutionaries thought, "For the collective cause, for socialism, this old man gets up early and returns late, comes through wind and rain, does not shy away from hard work, and is not afraid of bitterness. He wholeheartedly herds livestock for the commune. If we read some of Chairman Mao's works to him, wouldn't it make him even clearer in mind and eye?" So, the young revolutionaries, despite the pain from the blisters on their feet, ran up the hillside and said to the old man, "Grandpa, let's study the 'Three Articles' together!"

The old man rubbed his eyes and took a close look. Oh! Standing in front of him were several young people full of vigor, each holding a book of Chairman Mao's works, with red armbands on their arms. A large red flag was fluttering in the wind. The old man happily said, "Good!" Then, the young revolutionaries surrounded the old man and began to read "In Memory of Norman Bethune." The young revolutionaries read with more and more vigor, and the old man listened more and more intently. He excitedly said, "Right! Chairman Mao's words are correct. A person's ability has its limits, but as long as one has the spirit of Norman Bethune, it's fine. I should also learn from Norman Bethune!" Finally, the young revolutionaries specially performed a dialogue "Hail the Success of Our Country's Missile and Nuclear Weapon Test Launch," a rapid-fire "Chairman Mao Receives Hundreds of Thousands of Revolutionary Students and Teachers," and specially told the old man that Chairman Mao's health was very good. The old man listened and laughed, excitedly saying, "That's great! Chairman Mao's health is so good, this is our greatest happiness! I, this old man, must study Chairman Mao's works well, wholeheartedly for the collective, wholeheartedly for the revolution, and raise all the commune's livestock to be strong and healthy!"

The young revolutionaries set off with red flags. The old man was still waving and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The shout echoed throughout the valley.

    山坡歌声
    红文
    “东方红长征队”在长征途中，把宣传毛泽东思想放在第一位，只要有机会就宣传。他们每到一地，常常是背包不放，汗水不干就宣传毛泽东思想。他们说：“为了宣传毛泽东思想，我们不怕累！”他们利用群众集会前，放电影前，劳动休息时，读“十六条”，教唱毛主席语录歌，演出短小精悍的节目，很受群众的欢迎。他们不管人多人少，都进行宣传，他们说：“多一个人掌握毛泽东思想，就会给革命多增加一分力量。”
    有一次，小将们来到离平型关不远的一个山沟里，看到一个六十多岁的老大爷在山坡上放牲口。小将们心想：“老大爷为了集体事业，为了社会主义，早起晚归，风里来，雨里去，不辞劳，不怕苦，一心一意给公社放牲口。我们为他读读毛主席著作，不是更能使他心明眼亮吗？”于是，小将们不顾脚上的血泡疼痛，一气跑上山坡，向老大爷说道：“老大爷，咱们来共同学习‘老三篇’吧！”
    老大爷揉了揉眼，仔细一看，嗬！迎面站着几个朝气勃勃的小青年，手里捧着一本本毛主席著作，臂上戴着红袖章。一杆大红旗被风吹得哗哗直响。老大爷高兴地说：“好呵！”接着，小将们把老大爷围在中间，读起《纪念白求恩》来。小将们越读越有劲，老大爷越听越入神，他激动地说：“对！毛主席的话就是对，一个人的能力有大小，只要有白求恩那种精神就行，我也得向白求恩学习呀！”最后，小将们还专门演了对口词《欢呼我国发射导弹核武器试验成功》、数来宝《毛主席接见百万革命师生》，还特地向老大爷讲毛主席身体非常健康。老大爷听着、笑着，激动地说：“太好啦！毛主席的身体这样健康，这是咱们的最大幸福呀！我老汉一定要好好学习毛主席著作，一心为集体，一心为革命，把社里的牲口都养得壮壮的！”
    小将们打着红旗出发了，老大爷还在遥遥招手高呼：“毛主席万岁！”这喊声回荡在整个山谷。……
