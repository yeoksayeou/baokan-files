Chairman Mao pointed out in his 1963 directive on literary and artistic work: "Socialist transformation in many sectors has yielded little result. In many sectors, it is still the 'dead' who are in charge." Instead of conveying Chairman Mao's directive downward, Summer Yat-sen engaged in conspiracies and stubbornly resisted.

Creating Amulets

	In late that year, Summer Yat-sen suddenly notified the New China Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio (New China Film Studio) to evaluate outstanding films and outstanding cinematographers, repeatedly urging immediate evaluation. The New China Film Studio hastily evaluated ten "outstanding films" and ten outstanding cinematographers. After reporting, it immediately received approval from the former Ministry of Culture and hastily held an awards ceremony.

	Summer Yat-sen and his group also extensively publicized that the New China Film Studio had "implemented the directives of the Propaganda Department," boasting that "the New China Film Studio has been a model in recent years," is the "vanguard of film," and is the "red flag" for implementing the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in literary and artistic work.

	Why did Summer Yat-sen, who had previously shown no interest in the New China Film Studio, suddenly change his attitude and enthusiastically praise the studio? It is clear that they wanted to gain some benefits from the New China Film Studio as a protective amulet to resist Chairman Mao's criticism and cover up their anti-party and anti-socialist crimes.

	Faking Repentance

	In March 1964, at a cadre meeting held by the Ministry of Culture, Summer Yat-sen spoke publicly against Chairman Mao's directive. He casually described many of his past anti-party and anti-socialist crimes as mere "directional errors," claiming that he had taken the "first step towards improvement."

	This is sheer nonsense! As early as 1942, at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out the direction for workers, peasants, and soldiers. How could it still be "directionless" in 1964? Summer Yat-sen's "direction" is very clear: it is the bourgeois direction of the "1930s" that his group stubbornly adheres to, the revisionist direction, the direction of emperors, kings, and scholars, and the direction of talented scholars and beautiful women. In short, they aim to take the path of capitalist restoration. As for the so-called "first step towards improvement," it is merely a trick to play at rectification, changing tactics.

	Performing a Counterplay

	Less than a month after Chairman Mao's second directive in July 1964, Summer Yat-sen, in collusion with Chen Huangmei, repeatedly instructed the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation to increase the "economic task" by five million yuan.

	"The real intention is not in the wine," this is a conspiracy: under the pretext of increasing income, they forced the distribution company to release six films about emperors, kings, and scholars, and talented scholars and beautiful women that had been filmed but were not yet convenient to release. At that time, the Cultural Revolution had begun, and Beijing and various places were holding performances of revolutionary modern plays. Summer Yat-sen attempted to create a situation where the stage and screen sing counterplays, obstructing and suppressing the rise of the cultural revolution tide. Although their methods were more concealed and cunning at this time, they had reached the point of "exhausting their tricks."

### 夏衍的滔天罪行是掩盖不了的

    夏衍的滔天罪行是掩盖不了的
    毛主席在一九六三年关于文艺工作的批示中指出：“社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微。许多部门至今还是‘死人’统治着。”夏衍不但不向下传达毛主席的批示，反而大搞阴谋，顽强对抗。
    搞护身符
    就在当年年底，夏衍突然通知新影（中央新闻纪录电影制片厂），要为优秀影片和优秀摄影师评奖，还一再催促马上评定。新影厂匆匆评了十部“优秀影片”和十个优秀摄影师。上报之后，立即得到前文化部的批准，并且匆匆忙忙地举行了授奖大会。
    夏衍一伙还大肆宣扬新影“贯彻了中宣部的指示”，夸耀“新影这几年是标兵”，是“电影的尖兵”，是贯彻文艺为工农兵服务方向的“红旗”。
    过去一直对新影不感兴趣的夏衍一伙，为什么这时一反常态，突然热心地夸奖起新影来了呢？一眼可以看出，他们想从新影捞取一点油水，作为自己的护身符，对抗毛主席的批评，掩盖他们反党反社会主义的罪行。
    做假检讨
    一九六四年三月，夏衍在文化部召开的一次干部会上讲话，公开对抗毛主席的批示。他把自己过去所犯的许多反党反社会主义罪行，轻描淡写地说成是什么“方向不明”的错误，说目前开始走上“好转的第一步”。
    这完全是胡说！毛主席早在一九四二年的延安文艺座谈会上就明确地指出了工农兵方向，怎么到一九六四年还是“方向不明”呢？夏衍的“方向”是很明的，这就是他们一伙顽固坚持的“三十年代”资产阶级方向，修正主义方向，帝王将相，才子佳人方向，一句话，他们要走资本主义复辟的方向。而所谓“好转的第一步”，也无非是玩弄假整风的阴谋，换换步法而已。
    唱对台戏
    一九六四年七月，毛主席第二次批示后不到一个月，夏衍伙同陈荒煤，接二连三地指示中国电影发行放映公司，要增加五百万元的“经济任务”。
      “醉翁之意不在酒”，这是一个阴谋：用增加收入的幌子，迫使发行公司把已拍好而一时不便出笼的六部帝王将相、才子佳人影片放出笼。当时文化大革命已揭开了序幕，北京和各地陆续举行革命现代戏会演。夏衍妄图用大映帝王将相、才子佳人电影的办法，造成舞台和银幕大唱对台戏的局面，阻挠和压制文化革命高潮的兴起。尽管这时他们的手法更隐蔽，更狡猾，却是到了“黔驴技穷”的境地了。
