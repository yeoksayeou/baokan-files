With 700 million people of the motherland as backing, and the support of the Red Guards, Macao compatriots are determined to achieve complete victory in the struggle against violence. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions and the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held rallies to condemn the bloody crimes of the Portuguese authorities in Macao. Various circles in Macao extended warm condolences to teachers and students who persisted in the struggle against violence and to the families of the deceased compatriots.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hong Kong on the 13th, the workers and people of Macao, Hong Kong, and Kowloon held rallies on the 11th and 12th to sternly warn the Portuguese authorities in Macao that they must immediately accept and fully implement the four proposals put forward by the Director of the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office and the six demands of the Macao compatriots. They must not allow the American and British imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits to interfere and create trouble; otherwise, the Portuguese authorities will surely reap what they sow.

At the rallies, workers from various industries read aloud Chairman Mao's quotation: "Resolve to fight to the end, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory."

At a representative meeting held by the Macao Federation of Trade Unions on the evening of the 11th, all representatives read the commentary article "Warning to the Portuguese Authorities in Macao" published in the People's Daily on the 11th. The representatives excitedly said that this is a great concern and support from the great socialist motherland for the Macao compatriots. It greatly encourages the Macao working class and people of all circles to overcome any difficulties and strive for victory.

The Macao Vegetable Farmers' Cooperative and other trade unions and community organizations also held protest rallies on the evening of the 11th. The representatives present expressed their unwavering confidence, saying that the Macao compatriots' struggle against violence has the support of 700 million people of the motherland and the backing of the revolutionary Red Guards. They will not allow the Portuguese authorities to evade responsibility. They are determined to achieve complete victory in the struggle against violence; otherwise, they will not rest.

That evening, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions also held a condemnation rally and issued a statement. The rally unanimously passed a message of condolence to the Macao compatriots and decided to send a delegation of workers from various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon to Macao to condole with the Macao compatriots who persisted in the struggle against violence.

The rally began with a collective reading of Chairman Mao's quotation: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are exactly such a bunch of fools." The representatives then spoke one after another, pointing out that while the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the motherland was achieving one great victory after another, the Portuguese imperialists dared to collude with the American and British imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits to massacre our compatriots. The workers of all industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon were filled with indignation and hatred. The representatives sternly said that if the Portuguese authorities still persist in their mistakes and dare to be enemies of the Chinese people to the end, they will surely suffer a crushing defeat.

The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce also held a condemnation meeting in the afternoon of the 12th and passed a statement protesting against the Portuguese authorities' bloody massacre of our Macao compatriots, as well as a message of condolence to the Macao compatriots of all circles.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hong Kong on the 13th, a "Macao Compatriots Condolence Delegation" composed of patriotic compatriots from various circles in Macao visited the teachers and students of various schools who were beaten and injured by the Portuguese fascist military and police, and who bravely persisted in the struggle against violence, to express their heartfelt respect and warm condolences.

The delegation visited the Hougang Middle School, Women's Federation Children's School, Guangda Middle School, Silver Industry Primary School, and Vegetable Farmers' Children's School to conduct condolence activities and presented "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the teachers and students who persisted in the struggle against violence. The venue resonated with thunderous applause and cheers. The teachers and students repeatedly shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

That day, the "Macao Compatriots Condolence Delegation" also visited the families of the compatriots who were killed by the Portuguese fascist military and police. On the 11th, the delegation had also visited the Jinghu Hospital to extend warm condolences to the 54 compatriots who were injured in the bloody massacre by the Portuguese fascist military and police. The injured compatriots and the families of the deceased compatriots angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the Portuguese fascist military and police to the delegation and unanimously expressed their determination to strive for complete victory in the struggle together with all the compatriots in Macao.

    据新华社香港十三日电　澳门、港九广大工人和各界同胞十一、十二日两天继续举行集会，严正警告澳门葡萄牙当局，必须立即接受并完全实现我广东省外事处长提出的四项主张和澳门同胞所提出的六项要求，不得让美英帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮插手和捣乱，否则，澳葡当局就必将自食恶果。
    在集会中，各业工人齐声朗读了毛主席的语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    澳门工会联合总会在十一日晚举行的代表会议上，全体代表朗读了《人民日报》十一日发表的评论员文章《警告澳门葡萄牙当局》。代表们兴奋地说，这是来自伟大社会主义祖国的对澳门同胞的极大关怀和支持，它极大地鼓舞着澳门工人阶级和各界同胞决心不怕任何困难，去争取胜利。

    声讨会开始，集体朗读了毛主席语录：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”接着，代表们接连发言，他们指出，正当祖国无产阶级文化大革命取得一个又一个伟大胜利的时候，澳葡帝国主义者竟敢勾结美英帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，疯狂屠杀我同胞，港九各业工人无不义愤填胸，切齿痛恨。代表们严正地说，澳葡当局如果仍然执迷不悟，胆敢与中国人民为敌到底，就一定会碰得头破血流。

    慰问团分别到达濠江中学、妇联子弟学校、广大中学、银业小学和菜农子弟学校进行慰问活动，并且向各校坚持抗暴斗争的师生赠送《毛泽东选集》和《毛主席语录》。全场响起了雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼声，师生们不断高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    这天，“澳门各界慰问团”还分别慰问了被澳葡法西斯军警杀害的死难同胞家属。十一日，慰问团还曾到镜湖医院向在澳葡法西斯军警的血腥大屠杀中受伤的五十四名同胞进行了亲切的慰问。受伤同胞和死难同胞家属，都向慰问团愤怒地控诉了澳葡法西斯军警的滔天罪行，一致表示要与全澳同胞一道去争取斗争的完全胜利。
