Title: The Gains and Losses of Praise and Criticism

When I was a salesperson before joining the army, customers always praised my service attitude. Having heard so much praise, I found it particularly jarring when I first received criticism in the army. To gain more praise, I would sweep the floor vigorously in front of my comrades, causing dust to fly and making the room unbearable. My comrades said I was "only doing superficial work," and I ended up putting in effort without gaining approval. Because I was afraid of being criticized, during production, I accidentally broke the handle of a rake, and I quietly put it back in the tool room. When someone saw me, I blamed it on "the rake being loose." In the end, I still received criticism. Why did I end up receiving criticism instead of praise? After studying Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism, I realized: it was because my attitude was wrong and my understanding was one-sided. Praise and criticism are both meant to mobilize positive factors, overcome negative factors, strengthen our team's unity, and advance the revolutionary cause. However, I harbored selfish thoughts, only thinking that receiving praise was good, without understanding that if my attitude was incorrect, receiving praise could also lead to "catching a cold"; I thought receiving criticism was shameful, without understanding that if my attitude was correct, criticism would remove my flaws and bring progress.

After my understanding improved, I no longer did good deeds just to receive praise, nor did I hide my flaws out of fear of criticism. As a result, I made much faster progress than before. From this, I understood that praise and criticism have gains and losses, and these gains and losses can be interchanged. Receiving praise brings honor and encouragement; if you treat it as a pillow and lie on it, you will lose more. Receiving criticism brings honest advice, and you lose face; if you treat it as a burden and fear losing face, and cannot accept honest advice, you will suffer. Only by truly treating praise and criticism as catalysts for ideological revolution can you continuously make progress.

    表扬、批评的得和失
    战士　钱智培
    我入伍前当营业员的时候，顾客们都说我服务态度好。听惯了表扬，到部队以后乍听到批评，觉得特别刺耳。为了多受表扬，趁班里同志都在面前，我拿起扫帚猛扫地，弄得灰尘飞扬，屋里坐不住人。同志们说我“尽干表面活”，落了个出力不讨好。因为怕受批评，搞生产的时候不小心弄脱了耙子柄，我悄悄放回工具室，被人撞见，又推说“耙子本来就不牢”。最后还是受到批评。为啥越想得表扬越得不到表扬，越怕批评硬是落到头上呢？学习了毛主席关于批评和自我批评的教导，才明白：原来是自己态度不对，认识片面。表扬和批评，都是为了调动积极因素，克服消极因素，加强我们队伍的团结，推动革命事业前进。可是，我抱着私心杂念，只觉得受表扬好，却不懂得如果态度不正确，受了表扬也可能“伤风感冒”；认为受了批评不光彩，却不懂得只要态度正确，批掉的是缺点，得到的是进步。
    认识提高了，我不再为了受表扬而干好事，也不再因为怕受批评而掩藏缺点。结果，比以前进步快多了。我从这里体会到，表扬、批评是有得有失的，得和失又是可以互相转化的。受表扬，得到的是荣誉和鼓励，你要是把它当成枕头，躺在上面睡觉，就会失去更多的东西；受批评，得到的是忠言，失去的是“面子”，你要是把它当成包袱，害怕失“面子”，听不进忠言，就要吃苦头。只有真正把表扬和批评都当成思想革命化的“催化剂”，才能不断地进步。
