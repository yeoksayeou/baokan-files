During a meeting to summarize the struggle against drought, we discussed the issue of how cadres should take the lead.

Being a cadre means taking the lead. But what exactly should be led first? Our previous understanding was unclear. We only led in production labor, but not in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Some comrades said: "Since we became cadres, we know we need to do a good job, and we need to take the lead. But we were not clear about what we should lead first. In the morning, we lead by calling people to work; when working in the fields, we lead by working ahead. It is completely necessary for cadres to take the lead in labor. However, if we only do this, it is not enough." He gave an example: During the summer drought last year, while carrying water to irrigate corn, one day I arrived late due to some business. When I arrived at the field, I saw some community members sitting at the edge of the field chatting and smoking, and they had not started working yet. I asked, "Why are you still resting?" Someone said, "We are waiting for the brigade leader to come and work together."

Many comrades also used their personal experiences to illustrate: Leading only in production, leading production with production; not leading in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, not doing political and ideological work, the result is that cadres themselves cannot achieve ideological transformation, and the community members cannot achieve ideological transformation either. Sometimes, although we can mobilize everyone, it is not stable. At the same time, if we just focus on leading community members in production every day, without seriously studying Chairman Mao's works, we will lose direction in the waves of class struggle and go astray.

Comrades also used many vivid facts to illustrate: Only by leading in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, by promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, by deeply rooting Mao Zedong Thought in the minds of the broad community members, by consciously breaking away from "self" and establishing "public," breaking away from "old" and establishing "new," can we truly and solidly improve production. Community members say: "With Mao Zedong Thought in command, even the old lady at home cannot sit still." The fourth production team had a community member who was originally called "work points fool" by the community. He arrived late to the fields, left early, complained about the low work points, and often argued with the work point recorder. After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he said: "Bethune is a foreigner who dedicated his life to the Chinese people. I am a Chinese, and my heart is only for myself and my small family. How meaningless is that!" From then on, he decided to discard the "self" and establish the "public." In the struggle against drought, he faced difficulties head-on, took on heavy work, and everyone elected him as the team leader.

Through such a discussion, everyone's awareness of leading in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has been raised. Comrades said: Only by first leading in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works can one become a revolutionary leader. Comrade Lin Biao said, "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat with a population of 700 million. It needs a unified, revolutionary, and correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought." Our brigade is the same. With several hundred people in the entire brigade, only by arming everyone's minds with Mao Zedong Thought can we have unified thoughts, unified directions, and unified actions. Only when cadres and the masses seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, will the spiritual appearance of people change, the relationship between cadres and the masses change, and the production situation change. In this way, we can make greater contributions to the socialist revolution and construction, and make greater contributions to the world revolution.

    首先要在学习毛主席著作上带头
    中共山西长子县城关公社同福大队支部委员会
    在一次支部总结抗旱斗争的会上，我们讨论了干部怎样带头的问题。
    当干部，就要带头。究竟最重要的是带什么头，以前的认识是糊涂的。光在生产劳动上带头，没有在活学活用毛主席著作上带头。有的同志说：“咱当上干部，知道要搞好工作，就得起带头作用，就是不明确首先应该带什么头。清早下地，咱带头叫人；下地干活，咱一股劲走在前头。干部在劳动上带头是完全必要的，但是，如果只做到这一点，那是不够的。”他举了一个例子说：去年夏季抗旱，担水浇玉茭。有一天，我因为有点事，去迟了点，到地里一看，有的社员坐在地头拉闲话、吸烟，还没有干哩。我问怎么还歇着呀？有人说：“等队长来了一起干。”
    接着许多同志都用自己的亲身经历说明了：光带生产头，以生产领导生产；不带活学活用毛主席著作的头，不进行政治思想工作，结果，必然是干部本身实现不了思想革命化，社员群众也实现不了思想革命化。有时虽然能把大家带动起来，但是很不稳固。同时，如果整天只是埋头领导社员搞生产，不去好好学习毛主席著作，就会在阶级斗争的风浪中迷失方向，走到斜路上去。
    同志们也用很多活生生的事实说明：只有带好活学活用毛主席著作的头，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动开展起来，使毛泽东思想在广大社员的思想上深深地扎了根，自觉地破“私”立“公”，破“旧”立“新”，才能真正扎扎实实地搞好生产。社员都说：“毛主席思想挂了帅，家里坐不住老太太。”第四生产队有一个社员，原来群众叫他“工分迷”，下地迟，收工早，嫌工分少，常和记工员吵。学习了《纪念白求恩》，他说：“白求恩是外国人，把生命都献给咱中国人民。我是个中国人，心里光有自己，光有小家庭，活的多没意思呀！”从此，他决心丢掉“私”字，树立“公”字。在抗旱斗争中，他迎着困难走，拣重活干，大家推选他当了作业组长。
    经过这样一讨论，大家对带头活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性提高了。同志们说：当干部只有首先带头活学活用毛主席著作，才能成为革命的带头人。林彪同志说“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”我们这个大队同样是这样。全大队好几百人，只有用毛泽东思想去武装大家的头脑，才能思想一致，方向一致，行动一致。只有干部和群众认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，人的精神面貌才会改观，干部和群众的关系才会改观，生产面貌才会改观。这样，才能为社会主义革命和建设做出更大的贡献，为世界革命做出更大的贡献。
