At a time when international imperialism and modern revisionism are shouting at the top of their lungs to curse us and trying every means to strangle us, we electric machine workers, with a spirit to bring glory to the Chinese people and to Chairman Mao, have taken on the task of designing and manufacturing a ten-million-kilowatt water turbine generator. Our feelings are both joyous and anxious. We are joyous because the Party and the people have great trust in us electric machine workers, entrusting us with this heavy responsibility; we are anxious because we young people have not only never manufactured such a machine, but we have not even seen one. We are truly afraid of not being able to complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the Party and the people.

At this time, some bourgeois "authorities" and "experts" within and outside the factory are blowing cold wind, saying that such a large-capacity, high-requirement water power equipment as the ten-million-kilowatt water turbine generator cannot be made in our country; even if it is made with great effort, the quality cannot be guaranteed, and it cannot be used in power stations. We heard these words and felt very indignant. Everyone unanimously expressed: We are workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We have the revolutionary courage of fearing neither heaven nor earth. Where there is a path, we will walk it; where there is no path, we will blaze a trail forward.

We studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary war is the people's business. Often it is not a matter of first learning and then doing, but of doing and then learning. Doing is learning." We realized that soldiers learn warfare from warfare; we make machines by learning from "warfare," and similarly, doing is learning. To meet the needs of socialist construction, we must learn while doing and increase our abilities while doing. Only by working diligently can we learn what we do not know, accumulate experience, find the laws, otherwise, we will forever remain at the original level and will never progress.

The processing began. Our group was responsible for the most precise part of the water turbine generator, the thrust bearing turntable. From the start, we encountered a tough "hard bone." This component has very high precision requirements. On a two-and-a-half-meter diameter flat surface, the smoothness requirement is very strict, and the parallelism of the two surfaces must not exceed 0.03 millimeters, equivalent to half the thickness of a hair. If processed by the old method, it would not meet the design requirements.

We brought this problem to the study of Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught us: "It is said that learning and using are not easy, meaning it is not easy to learn thoroughly and use skillfully. It is said that the people can quickly become soldiers, meaning this door is not difficult to enter. Combining the two, there is a Chinese saying: 'Where there's a will, there's a way.'" Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we mobilized all the comrades in the group to use their brains, find ways, and be determined to enter the door and learn thoroughly and use skillfully. With the cooperation of the design and production departments, we adopted the new processing method of the grinding disc. However, as soon as this problem was solved, a new problem arose: the grinding disc did not rotate when it came into contact with the surface of the workpiece, and the surface of the workpiece was scratched with small grooves. At this time, we remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on the importance of practice in learning, realizing that practice is the key. Only through practice can we find the laws of development of things, affirm the correct things, and correct the wrong methods. We re-examined, analyzed, and researched, and through repeated practice, we finally found four reasons for the problem. First, due to the grinding disc being too tight or too loose with the surface of the workpiece, it did not rotate; second, due to the grinding disc shaft and bearing being too tight, it did not rotate; third, due to the unclean working environment, the operator brought dirt, iron filings into the surface of the workpiece, causing small grooves; fourth, due to burrs or other debris on the surface of the grinding disc, it caused small grooves on the surface of the workpiece. After finding the causes, we studied and solved them one by one. We took the initiative and finally overcame one difficulty after another, making the thrust bearing turntable meet the design standards.

Our process of processing and manufacturing the ten-million-kilowatt water turbine generator is a process of doing and then learning. We deeply feel that all true knowledge comes from practice. No matter how many books you read, if you are not brave enough to practice and use them boldly, you can at most be a "bookcase." Only by daring to practice and using boldly can we overcome all difficulties and climb any scientific and technological peak.

    世上无难事　只怕有心人
    哈尔滨电机厂十车间立车组
    正当国际上帝国主义和现代修正主义声嘶力竭地咒骂我们，千方百计地卡我们脖子的时候，我们电机工人憋着一股为中国人民争光，为伟大领袖毛主席争光的志气，接受了设计和制造十万瓩水轮发电机的任务。我们的心情是既高兴，又担心。高兴的是党和人民对我们电机工人十分信任，将这副重担子交给了我们；担心的是我们这些青年人别说是制造，就是看都没有看见过十万瓩水轮发电机，真怕完不成党和人民交给我们的光荣任务。
    这时，厂内、厂外的一些资产阶级“权威”、“专家”在一旁吹冷风，胡说什么：像十万瓩水轮发电机这样大容量、高要求的水电设备，我国是做不出来的；即使勉强做出来，也保证不了质量，不能用到电站上。我们听了这些话，心里感到非常气愤。大家一致表示：我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，我们有天不怕，地不怕的革命勇气，有路要走，没路更要闯出一条前进的道路来。
    我们学习了毛主席的教导：“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”认识到，战士打仗是从战争学习战争，干就是学习；我们造机器也是从“战争”学习“战争”，同样也是干就是学习。为了适应社会主义建设的需要，我们必须在干中学，在干中增长才干。只有脚踏实地地干，才能学会我们不会的东西，才能积累经验，找出规律，否则，将永远停留在原来的水平上，永远不会前进。
    加工开始了。我们小组担负了水轮发电机中最精密的推力轴承转环的加工任务。一开始，我们就遇到了一块难啃的“硬骨头”。这种部件精度要求非常高。在二米五直径的大平面上，光洁度要求很严，两面平行度不得超过零点零三毫米，即相当于半根头发丝那么小的距离。如果按老办法加工，就达不到设计要求。
    我们带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们说：“说学习和使用不容易，是说学得彻底，用得纯熟不容易。说老百姓很快可以变成军人，是说此门并不难入。把二者总合起来，用得着中国一句老话：‘世上无难事，只怕有心人。’”我们按照毛主席的教导，发动全组同志，动脑筋，想办法，做有心人，一定要使自己能够入门，并且能够学得彻底，用得纯熟。在设计部门和生产部门的配合下，我们采用了研磨盘这个新的加工方法。可是，这个问题刚解决，新的问题又摆在面前：研磨盘和工件表面接触时，研磨盘不转，工件的表面划成小道子。这时，我们想起了毛主席关于使用是更重要的学习的教导，体会到所谓使用，就是实践。只有通过实践，才能找出事物的发展规律，肯定正确的东西，修正错误的作法。我们又重新观察、分析、研究，反复实践，终于找出了产生问题的四个原因。第一，由于研磨盘与工件的表面接触过紧或过松，所以不转；第二，由于研磨盘的轴与轴瓦之间过紧，所以不转；第三，由于工作环境不清洁，操作者把泥砂、铁屑带入工件表面，所以产生小道道；第四，由于研磨盘表面有毛刺或其他杂物，所以使工件表面有小道道。找出了原因后，我们又逐项地研究了解决办法。自己动手，终于攻克了一个又一个难关，使推力轴承转环达到了设计标准。
    我们加工制造十万瓩水轮发电机的过程，就是干起来再学习的过程。我们深深体会到，一切真知都来源于实践。尽管你读书千万篇，不勇于实践，不大胆使用，至多不过是个“书柜子”。只有勇敢地实践，大胆地使用，才能战胜一切困难，才能攀登任何科学技术高峰。
