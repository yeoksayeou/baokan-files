	Finding Faults Amid Praise
	Driver Hu Guojiang
	In the past, whenever I heard others praising me, I would feel very pleased, thinking that I indeed had some skills. However, after receiving praise, I would often make mistakes. Why is this? After studying Chairman Mao's works, I learned to hold myself to a higher standard and understand that the more praise I receive, the more I should be vigilant and consciously examine my own faults.

	One day, the section's duty officer notified us, "The section chief will ride with you." Hearing that the section chief would be riding with me, I thought, "The section chief is riding with me for the first time, I must show him my skills." Along the way, my spirit was highly concentrated, and I passed through each station early. When the train entered the station and the signal was lowered, I paid extra attention, ensuring the train stopped smoothly at the designated spot. As soon as the train stopped, the section chief praised me, saying, "Little Hu, your basic skills are solid, but you must not be complacent; you must continue to improve." I turned back and smiled at him, thinking to myself, "Without these skills, could I have been on the 'Mao Zedong Number' locomotive?" But I said out loud, "This time, I just got lucky!" In fact, "just got lucky" was the truth. Previously, when stopping the train, I usually needed to start and stop twice to reach the designated spot. This time, because I was especially careful, I luckily managed to stop it in one go. However, at that time, I was so elated by the praise that I didn't think about it at all.

	Not long after, I made a mistake. Once, when I was stopping at the watering station, I thought, based on my previous success, I could stop it in one go. As a result, not only did I not stop it, but I also overshot the watering point by one meter. This incident was reported to the locomotive captain, who sternly criticized me, saying, "This watering station is very close to the signal. If it goes forward another three meters, it will cause a serious accident of running a red signal, which is extremely irresponsible to the people." At that time, I was still quite unhappy, thinking that one meter is still far from three meters! The locomotive captain pointed out my thoughts and asked me to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on ideological cultivation. Chairman Mao said, "Modesty helps one to make progress; conceit makes one fall behind. We must always remember this truth." Chairman Mao's words woke me up. I reflected on the previous praise from the section chief, realizing that I had not followed Chairman Mao's teachings of the two-line struggle to view the problem. I only saw the achievements and not the faults, resulting in this mistake. After that, I consciously looked for my own shortcomings in the midst of praise.

	Recently, as we were preparing to pull the train from Nan Cang back to Feng Tai, we heard that there was another locomotive behind us that had been working for an extended period. According to the regulations, the later-arriving locomotive should go last. At that moment, I had the thought of going first. However, I then thought, as part of the "Mao Zedong Number," I should embody the spirit of selflessness and dedication to the people. Thus, I proactively suggested to the duty officer that they should pull the train back to Feng Tai first to rest, and I would return five hours later. This suggestion was immediately praised by the duty officer and the crew of the other locomotive. This time, I did not relax because of the praise. When I returned home, I specifically studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," using the spirit of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and their selfless dedication to the people to examine myself. I also thought about how, in the past, when doing good deeds for the people, my thoughts often mixed with the desire for fame and recognition. In the midst of praise, I found this fault and used the praise as a starting point for progress, making Mao Zedong Thought take deeper root in my mind.

### 表扬声中找缺点

    表扬声中找缺点
    司机　胡国江
    过去，我每逢听到别人表扬自己，心里总是美滋滋的，觉得自己确实有两下子。但是，受到表扬之后，我又总是不断地出毛病。这是为什么？学了毛主席著作，我用高标准要求自己，懂得了越是受到表扬，越要警惕自己，越要自觉地检查自己的缺点。
    有一天，段上值班员通知说：“段长跟你们一起跑车。”听说段长跟车，我就想，段长第一次跟我走，得露一手让他瞧瞧。一路上，我的精神非常集中，站站早点通过。在列车进站撂闸时，我百倍的注意，使列车平稳地停在规定的地点。车刚停下，段长就表扬我说：“小胡，你的基本功过硬，可是不能骄傲，今后还得不断提高。”我回头冲他一笑，心想，没这两下子能上“毛泽东号”机车吗？可是，又嘴不从心地说：“这次是蒙上的！”实际上，“蒙上的”倒是真话。以前，我在停车时，一般都需要开动两次才能停在规定地点。这次因为特别小心，才侥幸做到了一次停妥。不过，那时我被表扬冲昏了头脑，根本不往那方面去想。
    时隔不久，我就出了毛病。有一次我在上水站停车，自认为根据上次的成绩，有把握一次停住。结果，不但没有停住，反而越过上水地点一米。这件事情让司机长知道了，他严肃地批评说：“这个上水站离信号很近，如果再往前超越三米，就会造成冒进信号的恶性事故，这是对人民极不负责任的表现。”当时我还很不服气，认为超过一米离三米还远着哩！司机长针对我的思想，要我好好地学习毛主席关于思想意识修养的论述。毛主席说：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”毛主席的话使我猛醒过来，回想上次段长表扬时，我没有按照毛主席教导的两分法去看问题，光看到成绩，看不到缺点，结果这次就出了毛病。以后，我就有意识地在表扬声中，找自己不足的地方。
    最近，我们正准备从南仓拉车回丰台的时候，听说后面有一台机车工作时间过长。按照规定，后到的机车应当后走。当时，我脑子里闪过自己先走的念头。但是又一想，自己是“毛泽东号”的，应该发扬毫不利己专门利人的风格。于是，我就主动向值班员提出，让他们先拉车回丰台休息，我晚回五个小时。这个意见，当即得到值班员和那台机车乘务员的赞扬。这次，我并没有因为受到表扬而放松自己。回到家里，我针对白天一闪而过的错误思想，专门学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》，用张思德、白求恩全心全意为人民服务和毫不利己专门利人的精神对照自己。还联想到自己以前在为人民做好事的时候，思想上常常夹杂着争名、争出风头的私心。我在表扬声中找到了这个缺点，把表扬当作前进的起点，使毛泽东思想在头脑里扎的根又深了一分。
