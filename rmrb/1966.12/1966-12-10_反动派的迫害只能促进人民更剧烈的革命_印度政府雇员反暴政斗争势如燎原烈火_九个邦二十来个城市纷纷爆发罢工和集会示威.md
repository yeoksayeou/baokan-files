A struggle for survival and against oppression by Indian government employees is spreading like wildfire in nine states and over twenty cities across India. This struggle, which is still in its early stages, is rapidly expanding nationwide.

Government employees in Uttar Pradesh began their second indefinite strike in five months on December 7. Over 450,000 people are participating in this strike, bringing the state government's work to a complete standstill.

The employees are demanding the withdrawal of arrest warrants for their leaders and equal living allowances with central government employees.

The day before the strike began, over 15,000 government employees in Uttar Pradesh held a massive rally outside the governor's residence in Lucknow. At the rally, leaders of the Uttar Pradesh Government Employees Joint Action Committee strongly opposed the government's repressive measures, including arrests and issuance of warrants, to suppress the masses. The meeting passed a resolution to hold an indefinite strike amid thunderous applause and shouts of "Long live the revolution!"

The reactionary government of this state is terrified of their struggle and has sent over 3,000 police and plainclothes agents to brutally suppress them, arresting five worker leaders at the rally. However, the government's suppression has not frightened the broad masses of state government employees; instead, it has made them more determined to fight. The Uttar Pradesh Government Employees Joint Action Committee issued a statement on December 7 warning the government: "The fire lit in Uttar Pradesh will soon spread across the country." The statement also said, "Four million state government employees across the country have decided to unite as one to oppose tyranny."

In Mysore State's capital Bangalore, 8,000 low-level government employees also held a demonstration. Police fired tear gas and beat 25 demonstrators with batons wrapped in iron. However, the crowd bravely retaliated with stones, injuring several police officers and a deputy police commissioner. They also held a meeting after the demonstration to condemn the police's brutality.

Government employees in Madhya Pradesh held a statewide demonstration on December 6.

Government employees in West Bengal began a week-long demonstration on December 5, demanding the withdrawal of all repressive measures and an increase in wages and living allowances.

In the states of Maharashtra, Kerala, Orissa, Bihar, and Punjab, government employees in many cities also went on strike and held demonstrations.

In New Delhi, the Indian government arrested over 160 people on December 7 under the pretext of opposing the ban on demonstrations.

The Indian government employees' struggle for survival and against oppression is continuing to spread with unstoppable momentum. The reactionary Indian government's brutal suppression is only fueling a broader and more intense struggle. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "The reactionaries in various countries... all the oppression they inflict on the revolutionary people, in the final analysis, can only promote more widespread and more violent revolution by the people."

    反动派的迫害只能促进人民更剧烈的革命
    印度政府雇员反暴政斗争势如燎原烈火
    九个邦二十来个城市纷纷爆发罢工和集会示威
    据新华社九日讯　新德里消息：一场印度政府雇员的争生存、反迫害斗争以燎原之势在印度九个邦、二十个左右城市中展开，这一斗争方兴未艾，正在迅速扩展到全国。
    北方邦政府雇员，七日开始了五个月来第二次不定期罢工，参加这次罢工的已有四十五万人，这个邦政府的工作全部陷入严重的混乱状态中。
    雇员们在罢工中要求政府撤销逮捕他们领导人的拘票，要求给他们同中央政府职工同等的生活费用津贴。
    这次大罢工开始的前一天，一万五千多名北方邦政府雇员在邦首府勒克瑙市长官邸外面举行了一次盛大的集会。在会上，邦政府雇员联合行动委员会的领导人强烈反对政府采取迫害、逮捕、发出拘票等反动措施来镇压群众。大会在雷鸣般的掌声和“革命万岁！”的口号声中通过了举行不定期罢工的决定。
    这个邦的反动政府对他们的斗争怕得要死，竟派出三千多名警察和便衣特务进行残酷镇压，并在会上逮捕了五个职工领导人。但是，政府采取的镇压措施并没有吓倒广大的邦政府雇员，相反，促使他们进行更坚决的斗争。邦政府雇员联合行动委员会七日发表声明警告政府说：“北方邦点燃起来的火焰将迅速燃遍全国”。声明还说：“全国四百万邦政府雇员已决定团结得像一个人一样来反对暴政。”
    在迈索尔邦首府班加罗尔，八千名政府低级雇员也举行了示威，警察施放催泪弹并用包有铁皮的警棍打伤了二十五名示威群众。但是群众英勇地用石块还击，打伤了多名警察和一名警察局副局长。他们还在示威后召开大会，谴责警察的暴行。
    中央邦的邦政府雇员六日举行全邦性的示威。
    西孟加拉邦的政府雇员从五日开始也举行历时一星期的示威，要求政府撤销一切镇压措施，要求增加工资和生活费用津贴。
    在马哈拉施特拉、喀拉拉、奥里萨、比哈尔、旁遮普五个邦的不少城市中，政府雇员也举行了罢工和示威。
    在新德里，印度政府七日借口群众反对禁止游行示威的命令，出动警察逮捕了一百六十多人。
    印度政府雇员的争生存反迫害斗争正以不可阻挡之势继续扩展，印度反动政府的残酷镇压，更加促使斗争更广泛更剧烈。正如毛主席指出的：“各国反动派……他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”（附图片）
