Vietnamese People's Daily says Vietnamese people resolved to defeat American aggressors

The U.S. imperialists' talk of "peace" means war, and their "peace talks" mean intensifying the war of aggression.

The commentary pointed out that recently, Johnson, Rusk, and Harriman and the like have been rushing about, playing up the "peace talks" fraud, attempting to deceive public opinion. However, they cannot deceive people because their sole aim is to intensify and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.

The commentary pointed out that since the Manila meeting, U.S. imperialism has sent 40,000 more troops, as well as many planes and warships, to South Vietnam. They have been continuously bombing the demilitarized zone. The Johnson clique has hurriedly increased the war budget from 10 billion to 15 billion dollars. At the same time, U.S. imperialism has intensified its air and naval attacks on North Vietnam, madly bombing Hanoi in succession.

The commentary said that the above-mentioned crimes of U.S. imperialism expose the fact that its so-called "peace talks" are merely a means to cover up its new "escalation" in its wicked war of aggression.

The commentary concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people throughout the country have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Hu's sacred call to resist America and save the nation on July 17 this year and the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 14. They are resolved to devote all their energy to defeating the American aggressors and to accomplish the glorious task of liberating the South, defending the North, and reunifying the fatherland.

Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Warns Thai Reactionaries Serving U.S. Imperialism Will Meet a Bad End

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 21, the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on December 20, strongly protesting the Thai reactionary regime's criminal act of providing military bases to U.S. imperialism and serving the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam.

The statement revealed that since the Manila meeting, the Thai authorities have further intensified their collusion with the U.S. aggressors, sending cruisers, landing craft, and naval forces to South Vietnam to directly participate in combat with the U.S. army and its puppet forces. More seriously, the Thai authorities have conspired with the U.S. to plan the deployment of B-52 strategic bombers to the U.S. airbase in Utapao, Thailand.

The statement expressed full support for the statement issued by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on December 14, 1966, on this matter. It firmly demands that the Thai authorities must withdraw all Thai mercenary troops from South Vietnam; must immediately stop the U.S. from using Thai bases to bomb and strafe both South and North Vietnam; and must immediately stop the plan to deploy U.S. B-52 bombers in Thailand.

The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sternly warns the Thai authorities: if they insist on allowing the U.S. to use Thai territory as a springboard for aggression against the Vietnamese people and the people of Indochina, they will have to bear the heavy responsibility of expanding the war crisis in this region and will inevitably meet the same fate of failure as their masters.

    越《人民报》说越南人民决心尽全力战胜美国强盗
    美帝玩弄和谈骗局就是为了扩大战争
    新华社河内二十一日电　越南《人民报》二十一日发表评论说，在美帝国主义的嘴里，“和平”的含义就是战争，“和平谈判”的含义就是加强侵略战争。
    评论指出，约翰逊、腊斯克和哈里曼之流最近东奔西跑，大肆玩弄“和谈”骗局，妄图欺骗舆论。但是，它们是骗不了人的，因为它们要达到的唯一目的，就是加强和扩大侵略越南的战争。
    评论指出，自马尼拉会议以来，美帝国主义就向越南南方增派了四万名军队以及许多飞机和军舰，连续轰炸非军事区。约翰逊集团还匆匆忙忙把战争预算从一百亿美元增加到一百五十亿美元。同时，美帝国主义加强用飞机和军舰来袭击越南北方，疯狂地接连轰炸河内。
    评论说，美帝国主义的上述罪行，暴露了它的所谓“和谈”只不过是为了掩盖它在万恶的侵略战争中进行新的战争“升级”，而采取的骗人手段。
    评论最后说，越南全国人民热烈响应胡主席今年七月十七日的抗美救国神圣号召和越南民主共和国政府十二月十四日的声明，决心拿出全部精力来战胜美国强盗，完成解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国的光荣任务。
    越南外交部警告泰国反动当局为美帝效劳决不会有好下场
    据新华社河内二十一日电　越南民主共和国外交部二十日发表声明，强烈抗议泰国反动当局向美帝国主义提供军事基地，为美国侵越战争效劳的罪恶行动。
    声明揭露说，自从马尼拉会议以后，泰国当局又进一步加紧同美国侵略者勾结，增派巡洋舰、登陆艇和海军到越南南方，直接参加美国军队及其走狗军队的作战。更严重的是，泰国当局竟然伙同美国加紧策划把B—52型战略轰炸机进驻泰国乌塔保基地的阴谋。
    声明表示完全支持越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会一九六六年十二月十四日就这个事件发表的声明。坚决要求泰国当局必须把泰国帮凶军全部撤出越南南方；必须立即让美国停止使用泰国的基地对越南南北两方进行轰炸、扫射；必须立即停止推行让美国B—52型飞机进驻泰国的计划。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府严厉警告泰国当局：如果它仍然顽固地让美国使用泰国领土作为反对越南人民和印度支那人民的侵略跳板，它就必须承担扩大这个地区的战争危机的重大责任，必定遭到同它的主子一样的失败命运。
