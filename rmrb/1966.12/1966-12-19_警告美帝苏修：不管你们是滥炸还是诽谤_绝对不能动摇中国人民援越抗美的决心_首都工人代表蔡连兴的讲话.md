I represent all the workers of the capital to strongly condemn the heinous crime of the U.S. imperialists bombing Hanoi. I pay my highest respects to the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting and warmly celebrate the sixth anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

In recent days, the American bandits have been madly bombing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, causing heavy casualties and destruction. This is a serious provocation by U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people and all revolutionary people of the world. It is a serious step in the conspiracy of "bombing to force negotiations" by U.S. imperialism in collusion with Soviet revisionism. Chinese workers strongly protest against the evil actions of the U.S. imperialists' "escalation" of the war and strongly condemn the traitorous deeds of Soviet revisionism.

The Vietnamese people are a heroic people tempered by long years of war. They will not be intimidated by the war threats of U.S. imperialism. Chairman Ho Chi Minh said well: "The more the U.S. aggressors escalate the war, the more they will suffer heavy defeats. The more vicious they are, the more our people will hate them and the more determined we will be to defeat them." This is the solemn pledge of the 31 million Vietnamese people to defeat the U.S. aggressors. The desperate struggles of U.S. imperialism can only hasten their doom in the vast sea of people's war launched by the Vietnamese people.

The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are forever the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people. Recently, the American bandits' planes brazenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to intimidate the Chinese people with war and test their resolve to aid Vietnam in fighting the U.S. We must honestly tell U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism that no matter how much you bomb indiscriminately or slander, you cannot shake the Chinese people's firm resolve to support the Vietnamese people. Your crimes will be punished tenfold, a hundredfold. No matter what happens, no matter what risks we have to take, the Chinese people are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's just struggle until we drive the last U.S. aggressor out of Vietnam. If U.S. imperialism dares to impose its war of aggression on the Chinese people, the Chinese people will surely break its backbone and smash its dog's head, thoroughly and completely annihilating it.

Chinese workers will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to seize the revolution and promote production, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, and promote the leapfrog development of socialist construction. We will support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation with actual victories in both revolution and production.

Victory to Vietnam! Defeat to U.S. imperialism!

Long live the revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam!

Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!

Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    警告美帝苏修：不管你们是滥炸还是诽谤  绝对不能动摇中国人民援越抗美的决心
    首都工人代表蔡连兴的讲话
    我代表全体首都工人强烈谴责美帝国主义轰炸河内的滔天罪行，向正在进行英勇斗争的越南人民致以最崇高的敬意，并且热烈地祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年。
    最近几天，美国强盗疯狂轰炸越南民主共和国的首都河内，造成重大的伤亡和破坏。这是美帝国主义对越南人民和全世界革命人民的严重挑衅，是美帝国主义勾结苏联修正主义推行“以炸迫和”阴谋的一个严重步骤。中国工人愤怒抗议美帝国主义战争“升级”的罪恶行动，强烈谴责苏联修正主义的叛徒行径。
    越南人民是久经战争锻炼的英雄人民，是决不会被美帝国主义的战争讹诈吓倒的。胡志明主席说得好：“美国强盗越进行战争
  ‘升级’，就遭到越惨重的失败。它越凶恶，我国人民就越仇恨它，越决心战胜它。”这是三千一百万越南人民决心打败美国侵略者的庄严誓言。美帝国主义垂死的疯狂挣扎，只能加速它们葬身在越南人民所掀起的人民战争的汪洋大海之中。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，永远是越南人民的坚强后盾。最近，美国强盗飞机悍然轰炸中国驻越南民主共和国大使馆，妄图用战争恫吓试探中国人民援越抗美的决心。我们要老实告诉美帝国主义和苏联修正主义，不管你们狂轰滥炸，还是欺骗诽谤，都绝不能动摇中国人民支持越南人民的坚定决心。你们的罪恶，定将得到十倍百倍的惩罚。不管出现什么情况，不管要冒多大的风险，中国人民决心不惜做出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争，直到把美国侵略者一个不剩地从越南赶出去。如果美帝国主义胆敢把侵略战争强加到中国人民头上，中国人民一定打断它们的脊骨，砸烂它们的狗头，干净、彻底、全部地把它们消灭。
    中国工人将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的高潮，坚决响应毛主席关于抓革命、促生产的号召，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，促进人的思想革命化，推动社会主义建设事业的飞跃发展，用革命和生产双胜利的实际行动支援越南人民的抗美救国战争。
    越南必胜！美帝必败！
    中越两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结万岁！
    胡志明主席万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
