Vo Nguyen Giap, Vice Premier and Minister of Defense of the Vietnamese Government, held a grand reception on the evening of December 21 to warmly celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese People's Army.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh and other leaders of the Vietnamese Labor Party and government, including Nguyen Huu Tho, Le Duan, Le Duc Tho, Pham Van Dong, and senior military leaders of the Vietnamese People's Army, attended the reception.

The delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, headed by Nguyen Van Tho, also attended the reception.

Vo Nguyen Giap spoke at the reception. He condemned the intensified aggression of American imperialism against South Vietnam and the bombing of North Vietnam. He said, "The American aggressors think they can intimidate our people with bombs, but they have encountered the extremely brave fighting spirit and invincible people's war of the northern military and people, suffering heavy defeats. Our people's determination to defeat the American aggressors is unshakable; instead, our resolve to defeat the American aggressors is as firm as stone and as hard as steel."

Vo Nguyen Giap emphasized, "The glorious victories of the northern military and people are the victories of our nation's indomitable will; they are the victories of the correct line of our Party led by the beloved Chairman Ho; they are the victories of the 'decisive battle, decisive victory' spirit of our people's armed forces."

He said, "In the flames of the anti-American national salvation struggle, our socialist North is becoming stronger and stronger, more powerful than ever. It is clear that the North has not betrayed the trust of our compatriots in the South and is playing a solid role as the rear base, with sufficient strength to foil all the American imperialists' plots to escalate the war and lead our people's anti-American national salvation cause to complete victory."

Vo Nguyen Giap warmly praised the heroic and outstanding fighting spirit of the South Vietnamese people in their more than twenty years of struggle against imperialist aggression, and praised the glorious victories achieved by the South Vietnamese people in the anti-American national salvation struggle under the banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam over the past six years.

Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that despite the aggressive and stubborn American aggressors' large-scale increase in troops to South Vietnam this year, making the total number of American troops in South Vietnam double that of last year, they still cannot escape their strategic passivity and are at a loss tactically, nor can they escape their political crisis. Meanwhile, the military and people of South Vietnam are becoming stronger and stronger.

Vo Nguyen Giap expressed his firm belief that no matter how many troops the American aggressors send or how frantically they escalate the war, the people of North and South Vietnam will resolutely fight and will surely defeat the American aggressors.

Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, Zhu Qifeng, and diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries in Vietnam attended the reception.

    武元甲在庆祝越南人民军建军节招待会上重申
    战胜美国强盗的决心毫不动摇
    胡志明主席和越南党政领导人出席了招待会
    新华社河内二十二日电　据河内报纸报道，越南政府副总理兼国防部长武元甲大将，二十一日晚上举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝越南人民军建军二十二周年。
    胡志明主席以及越南劳动党和政府其他领导人孙德胜、黎笋、长征、范文同和越南人民军高级将领等出席了招待会。
    以阮文进为首的越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团也出席了招待会。
    武元甲在招待会上讲了话。他谴责美帝国主义加紧对越南南方的侵略战争和对越南北方的轰炸。他说：“美国强盗以为，可以用炸弹来威胁我国人民，但是它遇到北方军民的极其勇敢的战斗精神和无敌的人民战争，遭到了惨重的失败。我国人民毫不动摇，相反，我们战胜美国侵略强盗的决心更加坚如石、硬如钢。”
    武元甲强调指出，“北方军民的辉煌胜利，是我们民族坚强不屈的意志的胜利；是以敬爱的胡主席为首的我党正确路线的胜利，是我国人民武装力量的‘决战决胜’精神的胜利。”
    他说：“在抗美救国斗争的烽火中，我们社会主义的北方越打越强，比任何时候都更加强大。很明显，北方没有辜负我国南方同胞的信赖，正在发挥着稳固的大后方的作用，有足够的力量挫败美帝国主义的一切扩大战争的阴谋，把我国人民的抗美救国事业引向彻底胜利。”
    武元甲热烈赞扬了越南南方人民二十多年来反抗帝国主义侵略的英勇卓越的斗争精神，赞扬了越南南方人民六年来在越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜下，在抗美救国斗争中所取得的辉煌胜利。
    武元甲指出，今年以来，尽管好战和顽固的美国强盗加紧向越南南方大规模增兵，使目前在越南南方的美国军队总数比去年年底增加一倍，但是，它仍然摆脱不了战略上的被动处境，战术上处于黔驴技穷的地步，也摆脱不了政治上的危机。而越南南方军民却越打越强。
    武元甲表示坚信：不管美国强盗增派多少军队，也不管它怎样疯狂地进行战争“升级”，越南南北两方人民坚决战斗，并且必定战胜美国强盗。
    中国驻越南大使朱其文以及各国驻越南外交使节和武官出席了招待会。
