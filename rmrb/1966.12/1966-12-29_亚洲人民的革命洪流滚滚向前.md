The revolutionary tide among the Asian people is surging forward. On the vast land of Asia, where the invincible thought of Mao Zedong is widely spread, the people's struggles against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionary forces of various countries have flourished and achieved new great victories in the past year. The surging revolutionary tide of the Asian people is rolling forward, heading towards new heights.

Chairman Mao said: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will certainly deal a decisive and destructive blow to the entire old world. The great victory of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America is a powerful proof of this." The developments in Asia over the past year have fully confirmed Chairman Mao's wise judgment.

Today, Asia is an important battlefield where the revolutionary people of the world are engaged in a great struggle against American imperialism and its accomplices. Over the past year, with the help of the Soviet revisionist leadership, American imperialism has intensified its counter-revolutionary global strategy, shifting its focus from Europe to Asia, actively forming an anti-China encirclement, and attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Asian people, especially the flames of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America. However, under the influence and inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of various Asian countries have united and fought together, exposing the various evil plots of American imperialism and its accomplices; they have defeated the armed attacks launched by American imperialism and its lackeys, fully demonstrating the unprecedented awakening of the Asian people and their immense power.

In the current focus of the world people's anti-American struggle, Vietnam, the past year has been a year of glorious victories in the heroic Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America. During this year, with the help of the Soviet revisionist leadership, American imperialism has on the one hand crazily expanded the war, and on the other hand intensified its "peace talks" conspiracy. However, this has not been able to reverse its defeat. The Vietnamese military and civilians, who are determined to fight to the end, have displayed the boundless power of people's war, making the American aggressors suffer even more defeats and heavier losses, creating an unprecedented favorable situation.

In the war of resistance against America, the 31 million people of Vietnam have united as one, with each person being a warrior against American aggression and each piece of land being a battlefield to annihilate the American aggressors. Over the past year, in South Vietnam, more than 100,000 American aggressors have been annihilated, which is more than five times the total number of American troops annihilated last year. In North Vietnam, so far, more than 1,600 American bandit planes have been destroyed in the fires of people's war. The most ferocious beast, American imperialism, is facing annihilation in the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war.

The Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression has greatly weakened and tied down the forces of American imperialism, disrupted American imperialism's global strategic deployment, and greatly encouraged and supported the revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia and the world.

Over the past year, in Laos, Thailand, as well as Malaysia and the Philippines, people's armed struggles have continued to develop and achieved new victories.

In Laos, the Lao people and the Lao People's Liberation Army have repelled the repeated attacks by American bandit planes and the right-wing military group of Laos on the liberated areas, foiling American imperialism's strategic conspiracy to seize central and southern Laos and connect the southern part of Laos with the battlefield in South Vietnam. Over the past year, the patriotic military and civilians of Laos have also recovered many important strongholds, further consolidating the liberated areas. In the first eleven months of this year, the patriotic military and civilians of Laos have achieved glorious victories, annihilating nearly 10,000 enemies and shooting down and damaging more than 150 bandit planes, dealing a heavy blow to American imperialism and its lackey, the right-wing military group of Laos.

Thailand is an important military base for American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and the entire Southeast Asia. Since this year, American imperialism has increased its troops in Thailand to more than 36,000, and has been working with the Thai reactionaries to launch "encirclement and suppression" operations against the people's armed forces. However, the people's armed forces in Thailand have grown stronger and more developed in the struggle against "encirclement and suppression." Currently, the activities of the people's armed forces in Thailand are not only in the northeast but have also spread to the south. From the beginning of this year to mid-November, the people's armed forces in the northeast and south of Thailand have engaged in 120 battles with the enemy, making the American and Thai reactionaries panic-stricken. Western news agencies have warned that Thailand is becoming a "second South Vietnam."

Chairman Mao said: "The rampant activities of all internal and external dark forces have caused national disasters; but this rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have strength, but also shows their last struggles, showing that the people are gradually approaching victory."

Over the past year, the fierce attacks launched by American imperialism and its lackeys against the people of various Asian countries have greatly promoted the awakening of the Asian people. While the people of many countries have taken up the torch of armed struggle and fought bravely against American imperialism and its lackeys, achieving victories step by step, the broad masses of the people in countries like Cambodia have been continuously fighting against American imperialism; the broad masses of the people in the Philippines, India, and other countries have joined the fiery mass movements, launching political struggles against American imperialism and its lackeys.

This year, the people of the Philippines have been fighting against American imperialism. In October, when the war criminal Johnson was plotting to expand the aggression against Vietnam at the Manila conference, the people of the Philippines reached the peak of their demonstrations. Angry Philippine people held protest rallies outside the venue, shouting in unison: "Down with the American aggressors!" "Johnson, Rusk, and McNamara are the murderers of the Asian people!"

In India, over the past year, the people of various classes have been engaged in massive struggles against the domestic and foreign policies of the Congress Party government, with waves of struggles rising and falling. The people of Kerala province held a large anti-hunger demonstration in early January, raising the banner of opposing the fascist tyranny of the Congress Party government, marking the beginning of the people's struggles in India this year. After that, whether in the big cities of India like Calcutta, or in some remote small and medium-sized towns; whether in the industrially concentrated West Bengal province, or in the heart of the Congress Party's reactionary rule—New Delhi, massive waves of people's struggles have swept across the country. Currently, the storm of mass movements has swept across the entire India, with the number of participants reaching 12 million. The Indian government is now surrounded by the entire nation.

In Indonesia, although the right-wing military clique has implemented the most barbaric fascist rule over the past year, brutally massacring tens of thousands of Indonesian people, the Indonesian people, with a glorious history of struggle, have been fighting against this fascist regime. Now, they are reorganizing and beginning to use revolutionary armed forces to fight against counter-revolutionary armed forces.

The heroic Indonesian people will certainly defeat the brutal rule of the reactionary regime and achieve the final victory of the revolution.

An important sign of the new awakening of the Asian people in the past year is that the broad masses of the Japanese people, while insisting on fighting against American aggression and the Sato government's servitude to American imperialism's aggressive policies, have been engaged in a head-on struggle with the various followers of Soviet modern revisionism.

The new followers of Soviet modern revisionism, at the 12th World Conference to Ban the Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held in August this year, revealed their so-called "united action" fox tail; then, in the activities of sabotaging friendly exchanges between the people of Japan and China, they revealed their ugly face of false friendship and true anti-China; their mad attacks on the great Mao Zedong Thought have more thoroughly exposed their false revolutionary nature. Their reactionary actions have precisely served as negative examples for the Japanese people. In the struggle against the followers of Soviet revisionism, more and more Japanese people regard Mao Zedong Thought as the magic weapon to defeat the Japanese and American reactionaries. The Japanese people who have grasped Mao Zedong Thought can best distinguish between enemies and friends, and best discern right from wrong; they have resolutely broken with those false revolutionaries.

Currently, in various organizations in Japan, the situation of reorganization is developing rapidly, affecting political, economic, cultural, and social aspects in a short period. This situation indicates that the Japanese people have immense revolutionary enthusiasm, and the forces truly striving for national independence are continuously gathering and growing, and a new high tide of massive anti-American patriotic movements is bound to come.

Chairman Mao said: "The imperialist wolves should remember that the era when they could arbitrarily manipulate the fate of mankind and arbitrarily carve up the Asian and African countries has gone forever." The developments in Asia over the past year show that under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the people of various Asian countries are striding forward bravely, marching towards the thorough smashing of the old Asia where imperialism and reactionaries rule arbitrarily. They firmly believe that a brand-new Asia will eventually be completely established in the East!

    亚洲人民的革命洪流滚滚向前
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想广泛传播的亚洲大地上，各国人民反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，在过去一年里蓬勃发展，取得了新的伟大胜利。亚洲人民的汹涌澎湃的革命洪流正在滚滚向前，奔向新的高峰。
    毛主席说：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命风暴，定将给整个的旧世界以决定性的摧毁性的打击。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，就是一个有力的证明。”一年来亚洲局势的发展，完全证实了毛主席的英明论断。
    今天，亚洲是世界革命人民同美帝国主义及其帮凶进行大搏斗的重要战场。一年来，美帝国主义在苏联修正主义领导集团的帮助下，加紧把它的反革命全球战略的重点从欧洲移到亚洲，积极拼凑反华包围圈，妄图扑灭亚洲各国人民革命的烈火，特别是越南人民抗美救国战争的烈火。但是，在毛泽东思想影响和鼓舞下的亚洲各国革命人民，团结战斗，戳穿了美帝国主义及其帮凶制造的各种罪恶阴谋；击败了美帝国主义及其走狗发动的武装进攻，充分显示了亚洲人民的空前觉醒，显示了他们无比强大的威力。
    在当前世界人民反美斗争的焦点越南，过去的一年是英雄的越南人民的抗美救国战争取得辉煌胜利的一年。在这一年中，美帝国主义在苏联修正主义领导集团的帮助下，一面疯狂扩大战争，一面加紧推行“和谈”阴谋。但是，这丝毫没能扭转它的败局。坚决抗战到底的越南军民发挥人民战争的无穷威力，使美国侵略者败得更惨，摔得更重。创造了空前未有的大好形势。
    在抗美救国战争中，越南三千一百万人民团结一致，敌忾同仇，每个人都是抗美救国的战士，每一块土地都是歼灭美国侵略者的战场。一年来，在越南南方，被歼灭的美国侵略军已达十万多人，相当于去年全年美军被歼总数的五倍多。在越南北方，到目前为止已经有一千六百多架美国强盗飞机葬身在人民战争的火海里。美帝国主义这只最凶恶的野兽在越南人民战争的汪洋大海中正面临灭顶的命运。
    越南人民抗美救国斗争有力地削弱和牵制着美帝国主义的力量，打乱了美帝国主义的全球战略部署，极大地鼓舞和支援着亚洲和世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    一年来，在老挝、泰国以及马来亚和菲律宾，人民武装斗争都在不断发展，取得了新的胜利。
    老挝人民和老挝人民解放军击退了美国强盗飞机和老挝右派军人集团向解放区发动的一次又一次的进攻，粉碎了美帝国主义企图攻占中、下寮，从而把老挝南部同美国在南越的战场连接起来的战略阴谋。老挝爱国军民一年来还收复了许多重要据点，进一步巩固了解放区。今年头十一个月中，老挝爱国军民已经取得了歼敌近万名、击落和击伤强盗飞机一百五十多架的辉煌胜利，沉重地打击了美帝国主义和它的走狗老挝右派军人集团。
    泰国是美帝国主义侵略越南和整个东南亚的一个重要军事基地。今年以来，美帝国主义在泰国大量增兵，把侵略军增加到三万六千多名，并且加紧伙同泰国反动派对人民武装力量进行“围剿”。但是，泰国人民武装力量在反“围剿”斗争中不断壮大，迅猛发展。目前，泰国人民武装力量的活动范围不仅在东北部，而且发展到南部。从今年年初到十一月中旬，泰国东北部和南部的人民武装力量同敌人进行了一百二十次战斗，使美、泰反动派惶恐万状。西方通讯社惊呼泰国将变成“第二个南越”。
    毛主席说：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”
    一年来，美帝国主义及其走狗向亚洲各国人民发动的猖狂进攻，极大地促进了亚洲人民的觉醒。在许多国家的人民高举武装斗争的火炬，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行英勇斗争并取得节节胜利的同时，柬埔寨等国的广大人民不断进行反对美帝国主义的斗争；菲律宾、印度等国的广大阶层的人民群众纷纷投入到如火如荼的群众运动中去，开展反对美帝国主义及其走狗的政治斗争。
    今年来，菲律宾人民一面坚持武装斗争，一面开展反帝示威斗争。在十月间，当战争瘟神约翰逊在马尼拉会议上策划扩大侵越战争的时候，菲律宾人民的示威斗争达到了高潮。愤怒的菲律宾人民在会场外举行抗议集会，齐声高呼：“打倒美国侵略者！”“约翰逊—腊斯克—麦克纳马拉是谋杀亚洲人民的凶手！”
    在印度，一年来，各阶层人民反对国大党政府对内对外政策的群众斗争波澜壮阔，此伏彼起。喀拉拉邦人民在年初举行反饥饿大示威，举起反对国大党政府法西斯暴政的大旗，揭开了这一年印度群众斗争的序幕。在这之后，无论是在印度的大城市加尔各答，还是在一些偏僻的中小城镇；无论是在工业比较集中的西孟加拉邦，还是在国大党反动统治的心脏——新德里，都掀起了声势浩大的群众斗争浪潮。目前，群众运动的风暴已经席卷了整个印度，参加斗争的人数共达一千二百万人。印度政府正在处于全民的包围之中。
    在印度尼西亚，尽管右派军人集团在过去的一年中实行了最野蛮的法西斯统治，疯狂地屠杀了数十万印度尼西亚人民，但是，具有光荣斗争历史的印度尼西亚人民一年来一直坚持同这个法西斯政权的斗争。现在，他们正在重新组织起来，并且开始用革命的武装来反对反革命的武装。
    英雄的印度尼西亚人民必将战胜反动政权的残暴统治，取得革命的最后胜利。
    在过去的一年中，作为亚洲人民新觉醒的一个重要标志是，广大的日本人民在坚持反对美国侵略、反对佐藤政府为美帝国主义侵略政策效劳的斗争的同时，同苏联现代修正主义的形形色色的追随者进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    苏联现代修正主义的新追随者在今年八月召开的第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会上，露出了所谓“联合行动”的狐狸尾巴；接着，又在破坏日中两国人民友好往来的活动中，露出了假友好真反华的丑恶嘴脸；他们对伟大的毛泽东思想的疯狂攻击，更加彻底地暴露了他们的假革命的本质。他们这些反动行径，恰恰充当了日本人民的反面教员。在同苏联修正主义追随者的斗争中，越来越多的日本人民把毛泽东思想看作是同美日反动派斗争制胜的法宝。掌握了毛泽东思想的日本人民最能分清敌友，最能辨明是非，他们纷纷同那些假革命者坚决决裂。
    目前，在日本的各种团体中，重新改组的形势发展得迅猛异常，在短短的时间内，已经波及到政治、经济、文化、社会等各个方面。这种形势表明，日本人民中间蕴藏着极大的革命热情，真正争取民族独立的力量正在不断集结和壮大，一个规模巨大的反美爱国运动的新高潮必将到来。
    毛主席说：“帝国主义的豺狼们应该记住，由他们任意摆布人类命运、任意宰割亚非国家的时代，已经一去不复返了。”一年来亚洲形势的发展表明，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，亚洲各国人民正在昂首阔步地奋勇前进，正在向彻底砸碎帝国主义和反动派横行霸道的旧亚洲大进军。他们坚信：一个崭新的亚洲迟早要在世界的东方完全建立起来！
