One Saturday evening, four Nepalese youths who had recovered from their illnesses at the Asia-Africa Youth Sanatorium in our country came to the civil aviation waiting room. After watching the flight attendants perform a propaganda program on Mao Zedong Thought, they were very pleased and requested that the flight attendants perform the song and dance "We Love to Read the 'Three Articles'" again. After watching, they were still not satisfied and asked the flight attendants to teach them this song. The four Nepalese friends quickly learned the first two verses of the song "We Love to Read the 'Three Articles'". Two Nepalese female youths told the flight attendants, "You young women can propagate Mao Zedong Thought, we are also young women, and we also love Chairman Mao. When we go back, we will also study the 'Three Articles' and propagate Mao Zedong Thought."

    我们也要学习“老三篇”
    一个星期六晚上，有四位在我国亚非青年疗养院治好了病归国的尼泊尔青年，来到民航候机室。他们看了乘务员演出宣传毛泽东思想的文艺节目后，非常欢迎，还要求乘务员再演一次歌舞“我们爱读‘老三篇’”，看完后他们还不满足，要乘务员教他们唱这支歌曲。四位尼泊尔朋友很快学会了“我们爱读‘老三篇’”这支歌曲的头两段。两位尼泊尔女青年对乘务员说：“你们女青年能宣传毛泽东思想，我们也是女青年，也同样热爱毛主席。回去，我们也要学习‘老三篇’，也要宣传毛泽东思想”。
