By the side of Shaoshan Village, ten thousand trees flourish; ten thousand rays of light illuminate the distant mountains. My heart is aflame, illuminated by the great thought of Mao Zedong. The sun's rays have shone on Beijing since ancient times, but how can its power compare to the thought of Mao Zedong? The radiance of Mao Zedong's thought illuminates all the peoples of the world. Chairman Mao, you are the eternal red sun!

    红太阳颂韶山村旁，万木争荣；万道霞光把远山照映。我的心啊，一片通红，照亮它的，是伟大的毛泽东思想。太阳的光辉自古照耀着北京，但它的威力怎能比得上毛泽东思想？毛泽东思想的光芒照耀着全世界人民，毛主席啊，是永远不落的红太阳！
                      英国　亚瑟
