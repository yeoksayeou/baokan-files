In the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, how can we use Mao Zedong Thought to forge a new type of communist who is selfless, dedicated to the public, and committed for life? Recently, representatives attending the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Guangzhou Military Region unanimously agreed: We must regard ourselves as the objects of revolution, use "The Three Articles" as a sharp weapon, and with a fearless spirit of "blood and iron," break down private interests and establish public interests. Only in this way can we quickly enter the sublime world of communist spirit.

The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the Guangzhou Military Region has been vigorously developing in recent years, and many advanced units and individuals have emerged in various systems. This conference was held amidst the triumphant songs of a new situation in the nationwide mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, with unprecedented scale, with 6,000 representatives in attendance. At the conference, the representatives, following Chairman Mao's instruction that the People's Liberation Army should be a great school, and Comrade Lin Biao's directive to push the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, spoke passionately about their experiences and insights, especially widely and deeply exchanging experiences in studying "The Three Articles," breaking down private interests and establishing public interests, and carrying out a revolution in the depths of the soul.

Chairman Mao said: "To ensure that our party and state do not change color, we not only need a correct line and policy, but also need to cultivate and train millions of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution." The representatives believe that the fundamental task of the new stage of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is to further use Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's worldviews, especially to use the brilliant ideas of "The Three Articles" to cultivate new communists. Everyone believes that as long as we have a sincere heart for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, dare to use "The Three Articles" to purify the "muddy water" in our minds, we can establish a communist worldview and, when it is necessary to sacrifice for the people's interests, remain calm and unperturbed; in life-or-death situations, give the hope of life to comrades and leave the threat of death to ourselves; in ordinary work, be content to be the people's "old yellow ox" and happily be a screw in the revolution; in life, "seek hardship" and always walk the "Long March Road." The representatives said, "The Three Articles" are about great public spirit, the embodiment of "publicness." The advanced individuals nurtured by "The Three Articles" are our concrete goals to learn from and catch up with. They can do it, and we can do it if we act according to the requirements of "The Three Articles."

Comrade Lin Biao said: "'The Three Articles' are the easiest to read, but it is not easy to truly put them into practice." Why is it not easy to put them into practice? Everyone feels that studying "The Three Articles" is a great struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews, a class struggle of breaking down private interests and establishing public interests in the realm of ideology, and an extremely profound thought revolution of eliminating bourgeois elements and promoting proletarian elements. This revolution will touch upon everyone's head and soul and will inevitably encounter various obstacles. However, breaking down private interests and establishing public interests is determined by the law of development of socialist society, is a requirement of the times, and is an irresistible historical trend. The communist spirit of selflessness will definitely defeat the bourgeois thought of selfishness, and Mao Zedong Thought will definitely quickly become the unified thought of the 700 million Chinese people.

How can we use "The Three Articles" to carry out a soul-stirring revolution and become new communists? The representatives unanimously believe: First, we must distinguish between friends and enemies in our thoughts. Only by hating the "self" to the core can we love the "public" deeply. Everyone said that in today's socialist revolution entering a new stage, and in the rapidly changing situation of domestic and international class struggle, the public and the private cannot "coexist peacefully" and cannot have one foot in each boat. We must engage in a life-and-death struggle with the "self."

The representatives present pointed out that using "The Three Articles" to break down private interests and establish public interests requires a high degree of self-awareness and thorough revolutionary spirit. Everyone said that the "self" will not withdraw from the historical stage on its own. In today's society, where the "self" is "shunned like a rat crossing the street," the naked "self" is becoming less and less. However, the hidden "self" is still active in some people's minds, some wearing the cloak of "publicness," finding various "legal" excuses to deceive people; some lurking in the depths of the soul, making a last stand; some are tough on the outside but soft on the inside, unable to cut off the tail; some are evasive, leaving room for maneuver. In a word, it is the "fear" that is at the forefront, fearing to injure dignity, fearing to lose honor, fearing to infringe on "acquired interests." Everyone solemnly pointed out: The greatest threat to the thought revolution at present is this hidden "self." Whether or not to break with this "self" is the dividing line between verbal revolutionaries and complete revolutionaries, and the touchstone of whether one is loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us that in the process of building a socialist society, everyone needs to be transformed. Comrade Lin Biao, based on the requirements of the new stage of socialist revolution, recently instructed us that we must regard ourselves both as a force for revolution and as the object of revolution, and constantly revolutionize ourselves. This points out the fundamental direction for us on how to correctly treat ourselves and thoroughly transform ourselves. Therefore, we must always place ourselves on the starting line of thought transformation, firmly stand on the side of "publicness," rise up to revolt against ourselves, constantly demand of ourselves with communist thought, urge ourselves with communist ideals, and compare ourselves with new communists. We must make our revelations thorough, our struggles fierce, and our transformations swift.

Many leading cadres participating in this conference, who have grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, felt deeply in their common study of "The Three Articles" that to lead millions of people to stride forward into the world of communist spirit, one must first revolutionize oneself. They said: Comrade Lin Biao requires all military personnel to study "The Three Articles" as a motto, to carry out thought revolutionization, which is first of all a requirement for cadres at all levels. The responsibility of cadres is not lighter than before, but heavier than at any time before; the requirement for thought revolutionization is higher than at any time before. Anyone who lacks awareness of this situation and is indifferent will be unable to complete the party's entrustment and will not have the qualifications to be a leader.

During the conference, all the representatives held a grand parade, enthusiastically cheering for our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao's eighth reception of the cultural revolution army, and enthusiastically cheering for the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. During this period, the representatives, with hearts full of love for the great leader, visited the site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute that Chairman Mao established in Guangzhou 40 years ago.

    用“老三篇”荡涤头脑中的“污泥浊水”
    决心做一心为公的共产主义新人
    广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表畅谈学习体会
    据新华社广州二十二日电　在活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动中，怎样用毛泽东思想铸造一心为公、一切为公、一生为公的共产主义新人？最近，出席人民解放军广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表们一致认为：必须把自己当作革命对象，以“老三篇”为锐利武器，以敢于“刺刀见红”的大无畏精神，破私立公，彻底改造世界观。只有这样，才能使自己尽快地进入崇高的共产主义精神世界。
    广州部队活学活用毛主席著作群众运动，最近几年，一直在蓬勃发展，各个系统都涌现出大批的先进单位和先进人物。这次大会，是在全国活学活用毛主席著作群众运动出现新局面的凯歌声中召开的，盛况空前，到会代表六千名。会上，代表们遵循着毛主席关于人民解放军应该是一个大学校的教导，和林彪同志关于把学习毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段的指示，满怀激情地谈心得，讲体会，特别是广泛而深入地交流了学习“老三篇”，破私立公，在灵魂深处闹革命的经验。
    毛主席说：“为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”代表们认为，活学活用毛主席著作群众运动新阶段的根本任务，就是进一步用毛泽东思想改造人们的世界观，特别是用“老三篇”的光辉思想培育共产主义新人。大家认为，只要我们怀着一颗对毛主席和毛泽东思想赤诚的忠心，敢于用“老三篇”荡涤头脑中的“污泥浊水”，就能建立起共产主义的世界观，就能在需要为人民利益献身的时候，做到脸不变色心不跳；在生死紧急关头，把生的希望让给同志，把死的威胁留给自己；在平凡的工作上，甘当人民的“老黄牛”，乐做革命的螺丝钉；在生活上“自找苦吃”，永走“长征路”。代表们说，“老三篇”是大公篇，是“公”字的化身，用“老三篇”哺育出来的先进人物，是我们学赶的具体目标。他们能做到，我们按照“老三篇”的要求去做，也一定能做到。
    林彪同志说：“‘老三篇’最容易读，真正做到就不容易了。”为什么不容易做到呢？大家体会：因为学习“老三篇”是一场无产阶级和资产阶级两种世界观的大搏斗，是一场意识形态里的破私立公的阶级斗争，是一场极其深刻的灭资兴无的思想大革命。这场革命，要革到每个人的头上，触及每个人的灵魂，必将遇到各种阻力。但是，破私立公毕竟是社会主义社会发展规律所决定的，是时代的要求，是不可抗拒的历史潮流。一心为公的共产主义思想一定会战胜为私的资产阶级思想，毛泽东思想一定会迅速成为中国七亿人民的统一思想。
    怎样用“老三篇”大闹灵魂革命，使自己成为共产主义新人呢？代表们一致认为：首先要分清思想上的敌我，只有对“私”字恨之入骨，才能对“公”字爱入肺腑。大家说，在今天社会主义革命进入新的阶段，在国内外阶级斗争急速变化的形势下，公和私绝不能“和平共处”，绝不能脚踏两只船，必须和“私”字展开你死我活的斗争。
    到会的代表指出，用“老三篇”破私立公，必须有高度的自觉和彻底的革命精神。大家说，“私”字是不会自行退出历史舞台的。在“私”字处于“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的今天，赤裸裸地表现出来的“私”字越来越少了。但是，隐蔽的“私”字，在有些人头脑中，还在活跃，有的披着“公”字的外衣，找出种种“合法”的借口，蒙蔽人们；有的潜伏在灵魂深处，负隅顽抗；有的口硬心软，下不了狠心割尾巴；有的躲躲闪闪，留有余地。一句话，是“怕”字当头，怕损伤尊严，怕丢掉荣誉，怕触犯“既得利益”。大家严肃地指出：当前对思想革命化威胁最大的，就是这种隐蔽的“私”字。愿不愿和这种“私”字决裂，是口头革命派还是完全革命派的分水岭，是是否忠于毛泽东思想的试金石。毛主席教导我们，在建设社会主义社会的过程中，人人需要改造。林彪同志根据社会主义革命新阶段的要求，最近指示我们，既要把自己当作革命的一分力量，同时又要把自己当作革命的对象，不断革自己的命。这给我们指出了如何正确对待自己，彻底改造自己的根本方向。因此，我们必须把自己经常放在思想改造的起跑线上，坚定地站在“公”字的立场上，自己起来造自己的反，时刻用共产主义思想来要求自己，用共产主义理想来鞭策自己，用共产主义新人来对照自己，做到亮要亮得透，斗要斗得狠，改要改得快。
    参加这次大会的许多领导干部，在和毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的一代新人，共同学习“老三篇”中，深深感到，要领导好千万大军向共产主义精神世界飞步前进，必须自己首先革命化。他们说：林彪同志要求全军指战员把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，搞好思想革命化，首先是对各级领导干部的要求。领导干部的责任，不是比过去轻了，而是比过去任何时候更重了；思想革命化的要求，比过去任何时候更高了。谁要是对这个情况缺乏认识，麻木不仁，谁就无法完成党的委托，没有资格充当领导。
    大会期间，全体代表举行盛大游行，热烈欢呼我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志第八次接见文化革命大军，热烈欢呼以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。这期间，代表们怀着对伟大领袖无限热爱的心情，参观了毛主席四十年前在广州举办的农民运动讲习所旧址。（附图片）
