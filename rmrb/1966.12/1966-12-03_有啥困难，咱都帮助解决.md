On November 8, our Long March team from the Henan Puyang Normal School arrived in Lincang, Shandong Province.

After marching over 300 miles, one of our comrades had a blister that had become infected, and he urgently needed a pair of suitable, lightweight cotton shoes. When we went to the market to buy some, unfortunately, there were none that fit. Somehow, this matter came to the attention of two elderly workers from the Lincang "July 1st" Cigarette Factory, Xing Yuanzhi and her family member Li Yucui. They discussed it and said: Chairman Mao teaches us that all revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other. Now that this young revolutionary has encountered difficulties, how can we not care or ask about it? So, they went home to look, went to the Lincang Shoe Factory to look, and asked among the workers of the cigarette factory. Finally, comrade Ding from the cigarette factory provided a suitable pair of shoes. He said, "These young revolutionaries are marching hundreds of miles to make a revolution and to see Chairman Mao in Beijing. Whatever difficulties they have, we will definitely help solve them."

When the comrade received the shoes, he excitedly said, "The workers care so much for me. I will definitely not disappoint their sincere hopes, firmly complete the Long March, and successfully reach Beijing to convey the deep affection of the workers and poor peasants to our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao!"

    “有啥困难，咱都帮助解决”
    十一月八日，我们河南濮阳师范学校的长征队来到了山东省临清。
    经过三百多里的长途行军，有一位同学的脚磨破化脓了，很需要一双合适的轻便棉布鞋。到街上买，碰巧没有合适的。这件事，不知怎么被临清“七一”卷烟厂的老工人邢玉枝和家属李玉清知道了，她俩一商量：毛主席教导我们，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。现在这位长征小将有了困难，我们怎能不管不问呢？于是，她们回家去找，到临清鞋厂去找，到卷烟厂工人同志中间去找。最后，卷烟厂的丁师傅让出了一双合适的鞋子。他说：“小将们步行几百里搞革命串连，到北京去见毛主席，有啥困难，咱们都坚决帮助解决。”
    当那位同学接到这双鞋时，激动地说：“工人同志对我这样关心，我一定不辜负他们的殷切希望，坚决完成长征，胜利到达北京，把工人、贫下中农的深情厚意，带给最敬爱的领袖毛主席！”
