The Liaison Conference of Participating Organizations of the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival and the Japanese Socialist Party issued separate statements on December 20, strongly protesting the Japanese government's unreasonable refusal to issue passports to Japanese youth visiting China, thereby sabotaging the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival.

The statement by the Liaison Conference of Participating Organizations of the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival said that the friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Japan are the sincere wishes of the peoples of both countries and have great significance for peace in Asia and the world. The statement pointed out that in the face of the U.S. imperialists' unending expansion of the Vietnam War, it is of great importance for the youth of China and Japan to gather together and renew the "pledge not to fight again."

The statement said that the organizations united in the Liaison Conference of Participating Organizations of the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival have made efforts to fulfill the above mission and to strive for the realization of the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. However, the Sato Cabinet remains obstinate, and at the Cabinet meeting on September 20, it brazenly trampled on the Constitution and refused to issue passports for those going to China to participate in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. This fully exposes the reactionary nature of the Sato Cabinet, the most reactionary of all the conservative party cabinets.

The statement also clearly pointed out that there are those who, while claiming to be friendly, actually oppose the friendship movement and, objectively, help the Sato Cabinet to obstruct it. The statement said that we must condemn these people. The statement said that we will further develop the unity established in the struggle for passports and, in the upcoming general election struggle, smash the Sato Cabinet's policy of hostility towards China, and fight to the end for the further development of Sino-Japanese youth exchanges.

The statement by the Japanese Socialist Party pointed out that the Japanese government is not only increasingly tightening its policy of hostility towards China but also adopting despicable deceptive tactics towards our party and Japanese youth. This nakedly exposes the reactionary and deceptive nature of the Sato Cabinet.

The statement expressed that the Japanese Socialist Party will strengthen its struggle in the future and resolutely smash the Sato Cabinet's unreasonable policy.

    日中青年友好大联欢参加团体联络会议等声明
    决心同佐藤反华政策斗争到底
    必须谴责那些口称友好而实际帮助佐藤政府的人
    新华社二十一日讯　东京消息：第二届日中青年友好大联欢参加团体联络会议和日本社会党，二十日分别发表声明，强烈抗议日本佐藤政府无理拒绝发给日本青年访华护照，破坏日中青年友好大联欢的行动。
    第二届日中青年友好大联欢参加团体联络会议的声明说，日中两国人民的友好和团结，是两国人民的衷心愿望，对亚洲和世界和平具有重大意义。声明指出，在美帝国主义无止境地扩大侵略越南战争的形势下，日中两国青年相聚一起，重新建立“不再打仗的誓言”是非常重要的事情。
    声明说，团结在第二届日中青年友好大联欢参加团体联络会议的我们，为了完成上述使命，为争取实现第二届日中青年友好大联欢做了努力。然而，佐藤内阁仍然执迷不悟，它在九月二十日的内阁会议上，竟然粗暴地蹂躏宪法，拒绝发给前往中国参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢的出国护照……这就充分地暴露了在历届的保守党内阁中最反动的佐藤内阁的本质。
    声明还明确地指出，有人口称友好、实质上反对友好运动，并在客观上帮助佐藤内阁进行阻挠。声明说，我们必须谴责这些人。声明说，我们将进一步发展在争取出国护照的斗争中所建立起来的团结，在即将到来的大选斗争中粉碎佐藤内阁敌视中国的政策，为进一步发展日中青年交流斗争到底。
    日本社会党的声明指出，日本政府不仅日益加紧它的敌视中国的政策，而且对我们的党和日本青年采取了恶劣的欺骗做法。这就赤裸裸地暴露了佐藤内阁的反动性和欺骗性。
    声明表示，日本社会党今后要加强斗争，坚决地粉碎（佐藤内阁的）这种毫无道理的政策。
