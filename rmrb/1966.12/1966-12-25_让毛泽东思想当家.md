Under the guidance of the thought of letting "Mao Zedong Thought Take the Helm," the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Red Guards Brigade in Daping Commune, Xiji County, Ningxia, have extensively and deeply carried out the "All-Red Family" campaign.

Currently, the entire brigade has produced a group of families who actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Many commune members who were previously illiterate have, with the help of others, read through the "Three Articles" (i.e., "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?"). Many can even recite them.

Many "All-Red Families" frequently hold study sessions, using Chairman Mao's words to examine their own thoughts and actions, and engage in criticism and self-criticism.

Once, during a rainy day when work was suspended, poor peasant Liang Zongxian helped the brigade sell sheep. Upon returning, he demanded that the brigade give him credit for one and a half work points. While studying the "Three Articles," he measured his actions against the standards of "completely" and "thoroughly" and found his actions to be wrong. At the family study session, he voluntarily made a self-criticism.

    让毛泽东思想当家
    “让毛泽东思想当家！”宁夏西吉县大坪公社红卫大队的贫下中农，在这个思想指导下，广泛深入地开展了“全家红”的活动。
    目前，全大队已涌现出一批活学活用毛主席著作的“全家红”。许多原来不识字的社员，在别人帮助下，已经通读了“老三篇”，不少人还能背诵“老三篇”。
    许多“全家红”的家庭，还经常召开讲用会，用毛主席的话，对照自己的思想行动，开展批评和自我批评。
    有一次，贫农冉宗贤利用雨天休息时间，帮助队上去卖羊，回来以后就要队上给他记了一分半工。在学习“老三篇”时，他用“完全”、“彻底”两把尺子一量，觉得自己的做法很不对头。在家庭讲用会上，他主动地作了自我批评。（附图片）
