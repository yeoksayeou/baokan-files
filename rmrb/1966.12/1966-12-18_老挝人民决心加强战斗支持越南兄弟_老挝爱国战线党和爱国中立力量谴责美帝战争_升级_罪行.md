The Lao people are determined to strengthen their combat to support their Vietnamese brothers. The Lao Patriotic Front and patriotic neutral forces condemn the U.S. imperialist's "escalation" of the war.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut, December 16th: According to the Pathet Lao radio broadcast on the 16th, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on the 15th, strongly condemning the savage bombing of the capital Hanoi of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by American aggressor planes in recent days.

The statement said that this extremely serious "escalation" of the war by U.S. imperialism is an extremely savage and brutal crime, which has aroused the indignation of all progressive humanity.

The statement said that the Lao people firmly believe that the Vietnamese people, responding to the sacred call for national salvation by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, will bury the American aggressors on their own land. The Vietnamese people will surely win! U.S. imperialism will surely fail!

The statement said that the Lao people, who share a common enemy with the Vietnamese people, will further strengthen their brotherly combat solidarity with the Vietnamese people. The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, on behalf of the Lao people, expresses its complete support for the statement issued by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 14, 1966, and demands that U.S. imperialism must immediately and unconditionally stop the bombing and strafing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, immediately withdraw all U.S. troops and their puppet forces from South Vietnam, and recognize the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people.

The statement finally said that in order to effectively support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people, the Lao people will do their utmost to smash all the plots and actions of U.S. imperialism against Laos, especially to smash its plan to send U.S. ground troops to directly attack and occupy the central and southern regions of Laos, in an attempt to turn Laos into a bridgehead connecting the U.S. military bases in Thailand and the battlefield in South Vietnam, and to expand the war to the entire Indochina.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut, December 16th: According to the Voice of Laos radio broadcast, a spokesman for the Lao Patriotic Neutral Forces issued a statement, strongly condemning the heinous crime of the U.S. imperialists sending planes to bomb the capital Hanoi of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The statement said that the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism can only make the hatred of the people of South and North Vietnam burn more fiercely, and make them unite more closely to carry out the just struggle against the Americans and for national salvation to the final victory.

The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Neutral Forces fully support the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the settlement of the Vietnamese question and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, demanding that the U.S. government immediately stop its actions of infringing upon the sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, immediately stop its aggression against South Vietnam, and must unconditionally withdraw all U.S. and its puppet troops, weapons, and war tools from South Vietnam, allowing the Vietnamese people to solve their own internal affairs.
