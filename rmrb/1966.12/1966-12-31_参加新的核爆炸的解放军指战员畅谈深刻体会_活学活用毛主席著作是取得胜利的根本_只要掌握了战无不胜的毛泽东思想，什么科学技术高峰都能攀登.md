Soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who participated in the successful new nuclear explosion, with hearts full of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, joyfully celebrate the success of the new nuclear explosion. They enthusiastically acclaim this as a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They say that this is a success achieved with the spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought, a success brought about by the revolutionization of thought, which has raised scientific and technological standards to a new level. They shout "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times!" a thousand times and ten thousand times.

The soldiers and officers recall that during the experiment, they consciously turned the test site into a large classroom and examination ground for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. With a spirit of seizing the day, they studied, lectured, and applied the "Three Articles" (Old Three Articles). In the struggle, they learned and applied, gaining a deeper understanding that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the fundamental key to the success of the nuclear explosion. The station chief said: "This new nuclear explosion was able to achieve one hundred percent success, primarily because we achieved one hundred percent in four areas: one hundred percent emphasis on politics, one hundred percent reading of Chairman Mao's books, one hundred percent listening to Chairman Mao's words, and one hundred percent implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions in our work." The soldiers and officers unanimously agreed from their personal experiences that the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought shines wherever it goes. As long as people listen to Chairman Mao, the machinery and equipment will listen to people. As long as one masters the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, one can create any miracle and scale any scientific and technological peak.

After hearing the congratulations and praise from the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission through the radio, the broad masses of soldiers and officers were extremely moved. They unanimously believe that the success of this new nuclear explosion was achieved under the leadership and personal care of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Military Commission, promoted by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and with the strong support of the people of the entire country. It was achieved by the broad masses participating in the experiment, implementing Chairman Mao's instructions of self-reliance, striving for progress, collective wisdom, and great cooperation. Our victory should be credited to the Party, to Chairman Mao, and to the people of the entire country. Everyone unanimously expressed that the praise from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is a new and higher requirement and expectation for us. We must resolutely respond to the great call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, and forever regard the "Three Articles" as our motto. We will carry out a revolution in our souls, further promote the revolutionization of thought. We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind." We will be humble and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, strive for greater achievements, and make new and greater contributions to accelerating the modernization of national defense and safeguarding world peace.

    参加新的核爆炸的解放军指战员畅谈深刻体会
    活学活用毛主席著作是取得胜利的根本
    只要掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，什么科学技术高峰都能攀登
    据新华社三十日讯　参加成功地进行新的核爆炸的中国人民解放军某部指战员，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱的心情，热烈庆祝新的核爆炸的成功，热烈欢呼这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。都说，这是用毛泽东思想的精神原子弹，成功地实现了新的核爆炸，是思想革命化，带来了科学技术的新水平。大家千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！！”
    指战员们回顾，在实验过程中，他们自觉地把试验场当作活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂、大考场，以只争朝夕的革命精神，大学大讲大用“老三篇”，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，更加深刻地体会到活学活用毛主席著作是取得核爆炸成功的根本。某站站长说：“这次新的核爆炸所以能做到百分之百的成功，首先是在思想上做到了四个百分之百，就是：百分之百地突出政治，百分之百地读毛主席的书，百分之百地听毛主席的话，百分之百地照毛主席的指示进行工作。”指战员们从切身体会中一致认为，伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉，照到那里，那里就亮，只要人听毛主席的话，机器装备就听人的话。只要掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来，什么科学技术高峰都能够攀登。
    广大指战员们从广播中听到党中央、国务院和中共中央军委对他们的祝贺和赞扬后，心情万分激动。他们一致认为，这次新的核爆炸的成功，是在毛主席、党中央、中央军委的领导和亲切关怀下，在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的促进下，在全国人民的大力支援下取得的。是参加试验的广大群众贯彻执行毛主席指示的自力更生，奋发图强，群策群力，大力协同的方针取得的。我们的胜利，应该归功于党，归功于毛主席，归功于全国人民。大家一致表示，党中央、毛主席对我们的赞扬是给我们提出了新的更高的要求和希望。我们一定坚决响应林彪副主席的伟大号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段，永远把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，在灵魂深处闹革命，进一步促使思想革命化。我们一定牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，为加速实现国防现代化，为保卫世界和平作出新的更大的贡献。
