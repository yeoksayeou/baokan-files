All the revolutionary workers of the Xi'an Electric Capacitor Factory have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's brilliant directive to break through the foreign framework and forge our own path of industrial development. They have thoroughly smashed the foreign framework and launched a technological innovation and revolution, transforming a factory that could only produce outdated mineral oil capacitors into a technically advanced factory that produces batches of the new products of the 1960s, trichlorobenzene capacitors, and successfully trial-manufactured China's first 100 million volt high-voltage standard capacitor. This year, the factory has completed the state's annual plan one month ahead of schedule and exceeded it, with production increasing by more than onefold compared to last year. In just one year, the factory has achieved the equivalent of two factories. Especially under the powerful impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, production has continued to develop, and the output in the third quarter has surpassed that of the first half of the year.

Since this year, the revolutionary workers of this factory have launched a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and guiding their actions with Mao Zedong Thought, significantly raising their class consciousness. The broad masses of workers have responded to Chairman Mao's call to seize the revolution and promote production, channeling the boundless enthusiasm ignited in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production. With the spirit of "daring" at the forefront, they dare to innovate, driving production to leap forward.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without removal, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." The revolutionary workers of the Xi'an Electric Capacitor Factory follow Chairman Mao's teachings, thoroughly smashing the metaphysical and cumbersome system of copying from foreign countries, and gradually establishing a set of management methods that face production, face the work teams, and face the masses, creating favorable conditions for the development of production.

    敢字当头　勇于创新　生产飞跃
    西安电力电容器厂今年产量超过去年一倍多
    据新华社西安电　西安电力电容器厂全体革命职工坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于打破洋框框，走自己工业发展道路的英明指示，大破洋框框，大闹技术革新和技术革命，把一个只能生产落后的矿物油电容器的工厂，改造成为成批生产六十年代新产品三氯联苯电容器，并且试制成功我国第一台一百万伏高压标准电容器的技术先进的工厂。今年，这个厂已经提前一个月超额完成了全年的国家计划，产量比去年增加一倍以上，在短短一年中实现了一厂顶两厂。特别是在文化大革命的强大动力推动下，生产不断发展，第三季度的产量超过了上半年。
    今年以来，这个厂的革命职工掀起活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动，阶级觉悟大大提高。广大职工坚决响应毛主席的号召，抓革命，促生产，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天干劲用到生产上去，“敢”字当头，勇于创新，推动生产飞跃发展。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。西安电力电容器厂的全体革命职工遵循毛主席的教导，大破照抄外国的一套形而上学的烦琐制度，逐步建立起一套面向生产、面向班组、面向群众的管理方法，为生产的发展创造了有利条件。
