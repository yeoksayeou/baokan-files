The editorial board of Xinhua News Agency: The Party Committee of the Nanjing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently made a decision to call on all officers and soldiers, especially leaders at all levels, to learn from Song Kongguang, the Party Committee Secretary and Team Leader of a certain team in the "Linfen Brigade."

Learn from his boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, his diligent and painstaking study of Chairman Mao's works. With the greatest self-awareness, the highest standards, and the fastest speed, transform one's worldview, uphold revolutionary principles, and maintain revolutionary youth.

Learn from his deep class feelings for the masses. His roots are in the platoons, his heart is with the soldiers, and he appears among the people as an ordinary soldier. First, he is a student, then a teacher. He cares about the people's hardships and is a confidant of the people.

Learn from his insistence on the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, firmly emphasizing politics. He achieves the goal of not changing direction despite a thousand changes and not wavering despite wind and waves. At all times and in all places, he leads with Mao Zedong Thought and uses Mao Zedong Thought to build a solid foundation for the ideological transformation of the troops.

Currently, the Nanjing Military Region is carrying out activities to learn from Song Kongguang. Here, we introduce the deeds of this outstanding team Party Committee Secretary and team leader to everyone.

Everything grows with the sun, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

Song Kongguang, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the Nanjing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the team leader and Party Committee Secretary of a certain team in the "Linfen Brigade," has an infinite love for Mao Zedong Thought, studies Mao Zedong Thought diligently, and actively spreads Mao Zedong Thought. He uses Mao Zedong Thought to transform his soul, and although he is old and often ill, he always maintains revolutionary youth. He uses Mao Zedong Thought to unify the Party Committee's thinking, and the Party Committee's spiritual face has undergone great changes, becoming the core of promoting the ideological transformation of the troops. He uses Mao Zedong Thought to unify the troops' thinking, and the troops' ideological transformation has presented a new situation.

Transforming the Soul with Mao Zedong Thought

In August 1965, Song Kongguang was transferred to this team. At that time, this team was building barracks in a remote mountainous area. When Song Kongguang arrived at his new post, he had a blueprint in his mind: the first step was to understand the political and ideological situation of all platoons in a short time; the second step was to work with the team Party Committee to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp political and ideological work tightly, and lead the entire team to advance rapidly on the road of being extremely proletarian and extremely combat-ready.

To achieve this blueprint, on the day after he took office, he set out to the grassroots level. He wore an old military uniform, carried a bag, and appeared in the platoons and on the construction sites. When the soldiers were breaking stones, he broke stones; when the soldiers were making mud bricks, he made mud bricks. Even when the soldiers were on official business, he joined in. Seeing his vigorous work ethic, who would have thought that he was a person who had suffered from hepatitis, had duodenal ulcers, back pain, and high blood pressure? The officers and soldiers respectfully said: We got to know the new team leader in the platoons, on the construction sites, and in our shared labor.

From many years of leadership work, Song Kongguang deeply felt that only a revolutionary leadership can lead a revolutionary team. To make the team revolutionary, one must first be revolutionary oneself. Therefore, he decided with the greatest self-awareness, the highest standards, the strongest resolve, and the fastest speed to transform his subjective world. No matter how tired he was after work and labor, he always took out his most beloved Chairman Mao's works from his bag under a kerosene lamp, listened to the leader's affectionate instructions with deep emotion, and used Mao Zedong Thought to measure his thoughts and actions.

In the harsh life of a remote mountainous area, in moments of extreme fatigue, he once worried whether his body could endure it. But at this moment, he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and it is more arduous." "Because of victory, there may be arrogance within the party, the emotion of considering oneself a hero, the emotion of stopping and not seeking progress, the emotion of seeking enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life again." He firmly grasped this fleeting thought and conducted an in-depth analysis. He realized that worrying about whether his body could endure it was, in essence, a reflection of the emotion of not wanting to live a hard life again as pointed out by Chairman Mao. He deeply felt that in the face of heavy revolutionary tasks, in the complex class struggle situation, and in the new period of deepening socialist revolution, a leader's soul must not have even a speck of dust. One must consciously and thoroughly use Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's soul to better revolutionize in the latter half of one's life, to never fall behind, to never change color, and to complete the important mission entrusted by the party and the people. The longer one's tenure, the more vigorous one's fighting spirit should be; the older one is, the more energetic one should be; the higher one's position, the more one should maintain the spirit of an ordinary soldier; the better one's life, the more one should maintain the style of hard struggle. Revolution is about doing, doing it thoroughly, doing it hard, and doing it with all one's might. Revolution is about struggle, and struggle requires paying a certain price, whether in war or in peacetime. This price is just a bit more suffering, a bit more fatigue, and even if one lives a few years less for the revolutionary cause, what does it matter!

Song Kongguang, with a strong desire to transform his worldview, decided to roll in the mud with the masses and undergo tempering in labor. Wherever there was difficulty, wherever there was hardship, he went there. He went to the construction site, broke stones, laid foundations, built walls, and covered roofs, participating in every process. He went to the horse handler's class to sweep the stable and remove horse manure, doing every job. Even the horse manure stuck to the bottom of the horseshoes, he personally picked it out bit by bit. He said: "Sweeping the stable and removing horse manure, although it is a bit hard and a bit dirty, it is beneficial for sweeping away officialdom and transforming thoughts." One day, Song Kongguang came to the second platoon's construction site and saw the platoon leader Li Shengsen building a wall alone, busy and hurried, so he took the initiative to pass him bricks and mortar. At first, Li Shengsen was very restrained and did not dare to order him around. Song Kongguang thought: He dares not order me around, which shows that I have not completely put down my airs, and he still does not dare to use me as an ordinary laborer. The more I take the initiative, the more diligently I work, the more I should work. Two hours passed, and Li Shengsen felt that this laborer was very cooperative, and the more he worked, the happier he became, to the point where he completely forgot that the person helping him was the team leader, and he boldly began to command. Sometimes he complained that the mortar was too thin, sometimes he complained that the actions were still not fast enough. Seeing this situation, Song Kongguang was also happier and more energetic the more he worked. This incident made him deeply feel that leaders must completely put down their airs and be unexceptional in labor to cleanse the dust from their thoughts and build a bridge to the soldiers' hearts.

With a high degree of self-awareness in transforming one's subjective world, one can have the greatest resolve to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Song Kongguang often said: "Transforming thoughts is like pulling out radishes, pulling out the roots and leaves together; it is not like cutting leeks, cutting one batch and growing another." With a strong desire to transform one's subjective world, one can discover problems from phenomena that are often overlooked by ordinary people.

When Song Kongguang was stationed in the ninth platoon, one night after lights out, a soldier fell ill and had no hot water to take medicine. Another soldier, who clearly knew that the team leader had a thermos of hot water by his bed, did not dare to go and get it. Song Kongguang personally brought the thermos to him, and the sick soldier called him "comrade" repeatedly, persuading him for a long time before taking a little medicine. When he was stationed in a certain artillery platoon, he often played basketball with the soldiers during his free time. On the basketball court, he discovered a strange phenomenon: whichever team he joined, that team was sure to win. After observing carefully, he found that as soon as he caught the ball, the soldiers did not dare to boldly snatch it. For the soldiers, leaving the water for the team leader to drink and letting the older and weaker team leader have a little consideration on the basketball court was not unusual. For a team leader, being able to care about whether a soldier has hot water to take medicine and personally bringing the water he prepared for himself; for the sake of blending in with the soldiers, being able to play basketball with young people, was already very good. However, these two incidents made Song Kongguang think deeply. He thought: The soldiers did not want to drink his water and did not dare to snatch the ball from his hand, which showed that in the soldiers' eyes, he was still an official, which showed that in his thoughts and actions, he had not completely eliminated officialdom and had not truly blended in with the soldiers as an ordinary soldier. He brought this problem to study Chairman Mao's works, and Chairman Mao said: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." He also said: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people." He deeply felt that living problems, although they seem small, are the first hurdle in transforming one's worldview. Whether a leader can always place himself in the position of a servant of the people, whether he can always maintain the character of an ordinary laborer, and truly blend in with the masses, first depends on whether he can share the same joys and sorrows with the masses in his life. He decided to make thoroughly eliminating officialdom and putting down airs a hurdle that must be overcome in his ideological transformation.

Chairman Mao's book pointed out the direction of revolutionization for him and opened up a path for revolutionization. He increasingly deeply felt that machines cannot be started without people, and revolutionary soldiers cannot advance without being armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Whether a leading cadre strives to study Chairman Mao's works and thoroughly transforms his worldview is not only a matter of whether he can revolutionize to the end, but more importantly, it is a matter of the construction of the troops, the cultivation of revolutionary successors, and the security of the state. Listen to Chairman Mao's words, do not forget a single sentence; act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, do not yield a single step. He actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, first focusing on transforming his worldview and taking a new step forward on the path of progress. Although he was over forty and had multiple chronic illnesses, he was spirited and full of energy. Although he held a leadership position, he was heart to heart with the cadres and soldiers. The cadres and soldiers respectfully said: In work and labor, Comrade Song is our vanguard; in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and grasping ideological transformation, Comrade Song is our leader.

Unifying the Thoughts of the "One Group" with Mao Zedong Thought

After Song Kongguang came to this team, he took on the position of team Party Committee Secretary. How to unite and rely on the Party Committee's "one group" to better lead the troops in revolutionary construction became a major issue he often considered. He repeatedly studied "The Working Method of the Party Committee" and deeply realized that to lead a team well, one must first lead the Party Committee's "one group" well. Chairman Mao said: "If this 'one group' does not act in unison, it is impossible to lead thousands or tens of thousands of people to fight or build." He thought: To make this "one group" act in unison, one must first make this "one group" united, using Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts of the Party Committee members, making the Party Committee members united under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. He believed that the thoughts of the Party Committee are the main peak of the troops' ideological battlefield. As the team Party Committee Secretary, the primary task is to firmly plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on this main peak.

As soon as he arrived at this team, he tightly grasped the study of Chairman Mao's works by the Party Committee's central group. He realized from his own experience that whether the study of Chairman Mao's works is effective depends on whether the self-awareness of transforming thoughts is high. Among leading cadres, some comrades often think that they have a longer revolutionary history, have received more party education, have gone through the test of war, have not made mistakes, and their minds are easily filled with a sense of satisfaction. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: "The enemy of learning is one's own satisfaction. To seriously learn something, one must start from not being satisfied with oneself." Therefore, to further improve everyone's self-awareness in studying Chairman Mao's works, one must free these comrades from the constraints of the character "satisfied" and make everyone deeply realize that without redoubling efforts to study Chairman Mao's works and urgently transforming one's thoughts, one cannot complete the leadership tasks and will fall behind.

Soon, the heroic deeds and diary of the great communist warrior Wang Jie were published in the newspaper. Song Kongguang was deeply moved by this communist warrior's heroic deeds. He believed that Wang Jie's spirit of thorough self-revolution and self-awareness in diligently studying Chairman Mao's works was just the east wind to help Party Committee members free themselves from the character "satisfied." Therefore, he immediately organized the Party Committee to lead the way in learning from Wang Jie, guiding everyone to compare and find the gap. Wang Jie's revolutionary history is shorter than ours, and he has received less party education than us, so why does he grow faster than us, and why is his transformation of worldview more thorough than ours? After comparing, many comrades felt that the "young warriors" had run ahead of the "old warriors," and this was indeed a situation where the times were pressing.

At the study meeting, Song Kongguang proposed a resounding slogan: "Whoever raises the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought higher, learn from him!" This became the common oath of the Party Committee members. Through learning, everyone deeply felt that whoever grasped Mao Zedong Thought had the right to lead. Leading cadres could only lead the troops to climb new heights of revolutionization by learning and applying new levels of Mao Zedong Thought.

After improving their ideological understanding, Song Kongguang and the Party Committee members took the "Three Articles" as their motto and as a sharp weapon for transforming their worldview, studying and applying them repeatedly, often reviewing and often comparing. Everyone deeply felt: Often studying the "Three Articles" and often comparing oneself can discover problems, can enhance revolutionary self-awareness, and can uphold high standards for transforming thoughts.

Song Kongguang believed that revolution relies on the masses, and self-revolution also requires the help and supervision of the masses. Therefore, he and the Party Committee members went to the masses, revolutionized themselves with the masses, let the masses keep an eye on their revolution; in practice, transformed their thoughts, and used the results of practice to test the effectiveness of transforming thoughts. Deputy Team Leader Zhao Fubin went deep into the seventh platoon to stay and insisted on working with the class. He said: "Working with the class can cleanse the dust from one's mind. The closer one is to the soldiers, the more revolutionary fighting spirit one has." Deputy Chief of Staff Li Qingxiang went deep into the platoons to work with the class and humbly learned from the soldiers, quickly realizing that transforming thoughts with the soldiers made one feel younger and younger. He deeply felt: The older one is, the more revolutionary fighting spirit one has. The older one is, the more vigorous one's fighting spirit is. Only then does one have the qualities of a proletarian revolutionary warrior. The soldiers' eagerness to learn, diligence in studying Chairman Mao's works, and spirit of learning and applying what they have learned are a great encouragement and motivation for the Party Committee members. They also bravely exposed their thoughts to the soldiers and accepted the soldiers' help. The soldiers praised Song Kongguang and also praised the other leaders of the Party Committee, saying they had the spirit of transforming thoughts and raised the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought high, and were models of revolutionary troops.

Song Kongguang unified the thoughts of the Party Committee with Mao Zedong Thought, making everyone think in one direction and work in one direction, becoming more united and stepping in unison. Everyone decided to revolutionize for a lifetime, study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, transform thoughts for a lifetime, and serve the soldiers for a lifetime! They decided to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and lead the troops to be extremely revolutionary.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to Unify the Troops' Thoughts

Chairman Mao said that politics is the commander, the soul, and political work is the lifeline of all work. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, Song Kongguang firmly grasped the education of Mao Zedong Thought and firmly grasped the emphasis on politics, building a solid foundation for the ideological transformation of the troops. The first thing he talked about when he went down to the platoons and the first thing he checked was the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, firmly emphasizing politics. He required the troops to remain unchanged despite a thousand changes and unshaken despite wind and waves.

Once, Song Kongguang went to the ninth platoon to check the construction progress and found that a stone slab was erected on the wall. He felt strange: The stone slab was clearly stable when placed flat, but it was not stable when erected. He thought there must be a problem here. After investigation, it turned out that the progress was rushed and the quality was neglected. Aiming at this situation, he organized everyone to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," inspiring everyone to use the spirit of "extreme responsibility" to examine their thoughts and work. Through learning, the soldiers realized that this was not just a problem of seeking progress without considering quality, but a big problem of not firmly establishing the idea of long-term preparedness. Song Kongguang took this incident as a live teaching material for educating platoon cadres. He said: "We must pay attention to the quality of every stone, building a solid foundation. But we must pay more attention to the quality of every stone in the 'foundation' of the soldiers' ideological transformation. Otherwise, the house is built, but the 'foundation' of the soldiers' thoughts is crooked, and that will be a big problem!"

Song Kongguang believed that whether the "foundation" of the troops' ideological transformation was solid depended on how deep the roots of Mao Zedong Thought were. The work of the troops was complex and varied, but he was determined on one thing: to propagate and implement Mao Zedong Thought, to unify the troops' thoughts with Mao Zedong Thought, and to lead all work with Mao Zedong Thought. He often told the platoon cadres: "We have a thousand tasks to do, ten thousand tasks to do, but the most important thing is to study Chairman Mao's works. Forgetting to grasp the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works is being foolish!"

In November 1965, the construction was in a tense stage when the newspaper published the heroic deeds of Comrade Wang Jie. Wang Jie was a model of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and Song Kongguang believed that learning from Wang Jie would greatly promote the troops' active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works and accelerate the troops' ideological transformation. The team Party Committee decided to suspend work for three days and carry out extensive activities to learn from Wang Jie. At that time, some comrades reflected: Time is more precious than gold now, how can we suspend work? Song Kongguang also thought that suspending work for three days would temporarily affect the construction progress, but he believed that through learning from Wang Jie, the troops' red flag of Mao Zedong Thought would be raised even higher, and the spiritual power would be transformed into material power, and the lost time would be made up. He firmly said: "The construction of barracks is important, but the construction of ideological transformation is even more important. We would rather let material things suffer temporary losses than let spiritual things suffer losses!" The facts proved that the troops learned from Wang Jie's revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, raised their awareness, and boosted their fighting spirit, greatly accelerating the construction progress and completing the task ahead of schedule. Chairman Mao said: "...if it is limited to general mobilization, and the leaders do not specifically and directly implement the work called for in some organizations, break through a point, gain experience, and then use this experience to guide other units, it is impossible to test whether the general mobilization proposed is correct, nor is it possible to enrich the content of the general mobilization, and there is a danger of the general mobilization becoming empty." Song Kongguang firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings. Through long-term practice, he deeply felt that to make Mao Zedong Thought take root in the troops and truly implement it in all work, the leadership could not be satisfied with general mobilization. One must work hard and meticulously at the grassroots level. To grasp deeply and meticulously, in less than a year since he came to this team, he visited every corner of the team, stayed in four platoons for a long time, and spent 75% of his time living at the grassroots level, exchanging hearts and talking with all the main cadres above the platoon level.

In the class struggle, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works is the fundamental way to build a solid "foundation" for the troops' ideological transformation. Song Kongguang repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and deeply understood that we must not only learn to fight against enemies with guns but also learn to fight against enemies without guns. Struggle requires weapons, and the sharpest weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. Practice can temper people the most, and through the practice of class struggle, the level of Mao Zedong Thought in the troops can be greatly improved. Therefore, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he and the Party Committee specially studied and organized the Party Committee members to go down to the platoons, study Chairman Mao's works with the cadres and soldiers, and actively participate in the struggle against counter-revolutionary revisionists and reactionary bourgeois academic "authorities." In this class struggle practice, the cadres and soldiers further felt that Mao Zedong Thought was the lifeline of the revolutionary masses, and the more fiercely the class enemies opposed Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely defend Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone consciously used Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls. Mao Zedong Thought took deeper roots in the minds of the cadres and soldiers.

Song Kongguang firmly and unshakably raised the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and consistently grasped the political and ideological construction of the troops, making the entire team present a new situation. The number of "Four Good" platoons steadily increased, and a large number of "Five Good" models emerged. Heroes and models like the communist warrior Zhang Hongbing, who are worthy of praise and admiration, are countless, and a new generation of communists is rapidly growing.

Recently, Comrade Lin Biao instructed the entire army to adapt to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, raise the mass movement of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and the army must truly become a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. The team where Song Kongguang is located enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, resolutely implemented Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, marched to the new "battlefield," and undertook the task of cultivating fields and farming. And in the new battle, they launched a new high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. They decided to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, advance along the extremely proletarian and extremely combat-ready road.

    突出政治的好团长——宋孔广

    目前，南京部队正在开展学习宋孔广的活动。这里，我们把这位优秀的团党委书记、团长的事迹介绍给大家。
    万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。
    解放军南京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、“临汾旅”某团团长兼团党委书记宋孔广，无限热爱毛泽东思想，勤奋学习毛泽东思想，大力传播毛泽东思想。他用毛泽东思想去改造自己的灵魂，虽然年大多病，却能常葆革命青春。他用毛泽东思想去统一党委的思想，党委的精神面貌起了很大变化，成为推动部队思想革命化的核心。他用毛泽东思想去统一部队的思想，部队的思想革命化出现了崭新的局面。
    用毛泽东思想改造灵魂
    一九六五年八月，宋孔广调到这个团工作。当时这个团正在偏僻山区里修建营房。宋孔广来到新的工作岗位时，心里就有了一本蓝图：第一步，在短时间内，摸清全团所有连队的政治思想情况；第二步，和团党委同志一道，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓政治思想工作，带领全团在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的道路上大步前进。
      为了实现这个蓝图，他到职的第二天，就迈开两腿，到基层去了。他穿一身旧军装，背着挎包，出现在连队，出现在工地上。战士打石头他打石头，战士脱土坯他脱土坯。甚至战士出公差，他也插了进去。看看他劳动中那股猛干的劲头，谁能想到，他竟是个害过肝炎，又有十二指肠溃疡、腰痛和高血压病的人呢！干部和战士怀着敬佩的心情说：我们认识新来的团长，是在连队，在工地上，在共同劳动中。
      从多年的领导工作中，宋孔广深刻体会到，只有革命化的领导，才能带出革命化的部队。要部队革命化，首先要自己革命化。因此，他决心以最大的自觉，最高的标准，最狠的决心，最快的速度，改造自己的主观世界。每天工作和劳动以后，不管怎样劳累，他总要在一盏煤油灯下，从挎包里取出最心爱的毛主席著作，满怀深情地聆听领袖的亲切教导，用毛泽东思想衡量自己的思想，检验自己的行动。
    在偏僻山区的艰苦生活中，在十分劳累的时候，他曾经担心身体是不是吃得消。但就在这个时刻，他想起了毛主席的教导：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”于是他紧紧抓住这个一闪而过的思想苗头，深入地进行分析。他认识到，担心身体吃不消，实质上正是毛主席指出的不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪的反映。他深深感到，在繁重的革命任务面前，在复杂的阶级斗争形势下，在社会主义革命日益深入的新时期，一个领导干部灵魂深处绝不能有半点灰尘，必须以高度的自觉彻底地用毛泽东思想去改造自己的灵魂，才能在后半辈子更好地干革命，才能永不掉队，永不变色，才能完成党和人民交给自己的重大使命。资历越长，斗志应该越旺；年龄越大，干劲应该越足；职位高了，普通一兵的本色不能变；生活好了，艰苦奋斗的作风不能变。革命就是要干，实干、苦干、加油干。革命就是斗争，斗争就要付出一定的代价，战时是这样，平时也是这样。这种代价无非是苦一点，累一点，即使为革命事业少活几年，又算得了什么！
    宋孔广带着改造世界观的强烈愿望，决心到群众中去滚几身泥巴，到劳动中去经受磨炼。哪里有困难，哪里艰苦，他就到哪里去。他到营建工地上，采石头、打地基，砌墙、盖草，每道工序都参加。他到驭手班扫马厩，除马粪，样样活都干。甚至马蹄底下粘积的马粪，他也亲自一点一点掏干净。他说：“扫马厩，除马粪，虽然苦一点，脏一点，但是有利于扫除官气，有利于改造思想。”一天，宋孔广来到二连工地，见班长李盛森一个人砌一堵墙，忙上忙下，就主动上去递土坯，送泥浆。开始，李盛森很拘束，不好意思支使他。宋孔广心里想：他不好意思吩咐，说明我还没有彻底放下架子，他还不敢把我当一个普通小工使用。我越要干得主动，干得踏实，干得勤快。两个小时过去了，李盛森觉得这位小工配合得得心应手，越干越欢，到后来简直忘记了给他当小工的人是团长，大胆地指挥起来了。一会儿嫌泥浆稀了，一会儿又嫌动作还不够快。宋孔广见到这种情况，也越干越高兴，越干越有劲。这件事使他深深感到，领导干部只有彻底放下官架子，在劳动中毫不特殊，才能清除自己思想上的灰尘，才能搭起通向战士心坎上的桥梁。
    有了改造主观世界的高度自觉，就能够有按毛主席指示办事的最大的狠劲。宋孔广常说：“改造思想要像拔萝卜，连根带梢一起拔；不能像割韭菜，割了一茬长一茬。”有了改造主观世界的强烈愿望，就能够从一般人容易忽视的平平常常的现象中发现问题。
    宋孔广在九连蹲点的时候，有天晚上熄灯以后，一个战士病了，服药没有热开水。另一个战士明明知道团长床边有壶热水，却不肯去倒。宋孔广亲自把热水瓶送过去，生病的战士一口一声“首长”，劝了许久才倒了一点把药吃下去。他在某炮连蹲点的时候，课余时间常跟战士一块打篮球。在篮球场上他发现了一种怪现象：他参加哪一队，哪一队准赢。仔细一观察，原来，他一接住球，战士就不敢大胆上去抢了。在战士来说，把开水留给团长喝，在球场上对年大体弱的团长让一让，不是很平常吗？在一个团长来说，能够关心到一个战士服药没有热开水，并且亲自把准备自己用的开水送过去；为了跟战士打成一片，能够和小青年一块打篮球，不是已经很不错了吗？可是，这两件事却引起了宋孔广的深思。他想：战士不愿喝自己的水，不肯抢自己手上的球，说明自己在战士眼里还是个官，说明自己平时在思想、行动上还没有彻底打掉官气，还没有真正以普通一兵的姿态和战士融合在一起。他带着这个问题去请教毛主席著作，毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。又说：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”他深深感到，生活问题，看起来是小问题，但它却是改造世界观的头道关口。一个领导干部能不能永远把自己摆在人民的勤务员的位置，能不能永远保持普通劳动者的本色，真正和群众打成一片，首先就要看他生活上能不能和群众同甘共苦。他决心把彻底扫除官气，打掉官架子，当作自己思想革命化必须攻克的一道关口。
    毛主席的书，给他指引了革命化的方向，为他开辟了革命化的航道。他越来越深刻地体会到，机器没有人不能发动，革命战士没有毛泽东思想武装就不能前进。领导干部是不是努力学习毛主席著作，是不是狠抓世界观的改造，不仅是关系到个人能不能革命到底的问题，而且更是关系到部队建设，关系到培养革命接班人，关系到国家安危的大问题。听毛主席的话，要句句不忘；照毛主席的指示办事，要步步不让。他活学活用毛主席著作，首先在改造世界观上狠下功夫，在前进的道路上迈出了新的一步。他虽然年满四十，又有多种慢性病，却精神焕发，干劲充沛。他虽然身居领导职位，却和干部战士心贴心。干部和战士敬佩地说：在工作、劳动中，宋团长是我们的排头兵；在活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓思想革命化上，宋团长是我们的带头人。用毛泽东思想统一
    “一班人”的思想
    宋孔广来到这个团以后，担任了团党委书记职务。怎样才能团结、依靠党委这“一班人”，去更好地领导部队进行革命化建设，成了他经常考虑的一个重大问题。他反复学习了《党委会的工作方法》，深深认识到，要带好一个团，首先要带好党委这“一个班”。毛主席说：“如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。”他想：要使这“一班人”动作整齐，首先要使这“一班人”心齐，用毛泽东思想来统一党委成员的思想，使党委成员在毛泽东思想指导下心齐起来。他认为，党委班子的思想，是部队思想阵地的主峰。作为团党委书记，首要的任务，就是在这个主峰上，牢牢地插上毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    他一到这个团，就把党委中心组的毛主席著作学习紧紧地抓了起来。他根据自己的经验体会到，学习毛主席著作是不是有成效，关键在于改造思想的自觉性高不高。在领导干部中，有些同志常常认为自己革命历史比较长，受党的教育比较多，经过了战争的考验，没有犯过错误，头脑里容易装个“满”字。毛主席早就指出：“学习的敌人是自己的满足，要认真学习一点东西，必须从不自满开始。”因此，要进一步提高大家学习毛主席著作的自觉性，就必须使这些同志从
  “满”字的束缚中解放出来，使大家深切地认识到，不百倍努力学习毛主席著作，不加紧改造自己的思想，就无法完成领导任务，就要落后。
    不久，伟大的共产主义战士王杰的事迹和日记在报上登出来了。宋孔广深深为这位共产主义战士的英雄事迹所感动。他认为，王杰那种彻底的自我革命精神，勤奋地学习毛主席著作的自觉性，正好是帮助党委成员从“满”字中解放出来的东风。于是，他立即组织党委带头学王杰，引导大家对比找差距，王杰同志的革命历史比我们短，受党教育的时间比我们少，为什么成长却比我们快，世界观的改造比我们彻底？一对比，许多同志觉到“小将”跑到“老将”前头去了，这确实是形势逼人。
    在学习会上，宋孔广提出了一个响亮的口号：“谁毛泽东思想红旗举得高，就向谁学习！”成了党委成员的共同誓言。通过学习，大家深深感到，谁掌握了毛泽东思想，谁就有领导权。领导干部只有自己学出新水平，用出新水平，才能带领部队去攀登革命化的新高峰。
    提高了思想认识以后，宋孔广和党委成员把“老三篇”当作座右铭，当作改造世界观的锐利武器，反复学，反复用，经常温习，经常对照。大家深有体会地说：经常学习“老三篇”，经常对照自己，就可以发现问题，就可以增强革命自觉性，就可以坚持思想改造的高标准。
    宋孔广认为，革命靠群众，自我革命也要取得群众的帮助和监督。因此，他和党委成员一起，到群众中去，和群众一起革自己的命，让群众盯着自己闹革命；在实践中改造思想，以实践的成绩来检验改造思想的效果。副团长钞福彬深入七连蹲点，坚持跟班劳动。他说：“跟班劳动可以清除掉自己头脑里的思想灰尘。离战士近一步，革命斗志增一分。”副参谋长李庆祥深入到连队跟班劳动，虚心向战士学习，很快体会到，和战士一起改造思想，好像越活越年轻了。他深有体会地说：“年纪大一点，革命干劲增一分，越老斗志越旺，人老思想年青，这才是无产阶级革命战士应有的品质。”战士们好学上进，勤奋学习毛主席著作，学了就用的革命精神，对党委成员是极大的鼓舞和鞭策。他们也勇敢地向战士亮思想，接受战士的帮助。战士们赞扬宋孔广，也赞扬党委的其他领导同志，说他们改造思想劲头足，毛泽东思想红旗举得高，是部队革命化的榜样。
    宋孔广用毛泽东思想统一了党委的思想，使大家心往一处想，劲往一处使，团结越来越紧，步子越走越齐。大家决心干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想，为战士服务一辈子！决心把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得更高，把部队带得非常革命化。
    用毛泽东思想去统一部队的思想
    毛主席说，政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线。根据毛主席的教导，宋孔广狠抓毛泽东思想的教育，狠抓突出政治，打牢部队思想革命化的“墙基”。他下连讲的第一件事情，检查的第一件工作，就是活学活用毛主席著作，坚定不移地突出政治。他要求部队做到千变万化不转向，风吹浪打不动摇。
    有一次，宋孔广到九连检查营建施工情况，发现墙上竖砌了一块石板。他感到很奇怪：石板明明平放着稳当，竖着砌不牢靠，为什么这样简单的道理会不懂得？他认为，这里面一定有问题。经过了解，是赶进度快，忽视质量。针对这种情况，他组织大家学习《纪念白求恩》，启发大家用“极端的负责任”的精神，检查自己的思想和工作。通过学习，战士们认识到，这不仅是只求进度不顾质量的问题，而是长期战备的思想没有牢固树立的大问题。宋孔广抓住这件事，作为教育连队干部的活教材。他说：“我们要注意每一块石头的质量，把墙基打牢。但是，我们更要注意战士思想革命化的‘墙基’上每块石头的质量，否则，房子盖好了，战士思想上的‘墙基’却砌歪了，那就会出大问题！”    宋孔广认为，部队思想革命化的“墙基”打得牢不牢，关键在于毛泽东思想的根子扎得深不深。部队工作尽管很复杂，情况多种多样，但是，他认准了一条，就是宣传、贯彻毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统一部队的思想，用毛泽东思想统帅全部工作。他经常对连队干部说：“我们有一千件工作要做，有一万件工作要做，但是头等重要的是学习毛主席著作。忘记了抓活学活用毛主席著作，就是个糊涂人！”
    一九六五年十一月，营建施工正进入紧张阶段，这时报上发表了王杰同志的英雄事迹。王杰是活学活用毛主席著作的典范，宋孔广认为，学习王杰对推动部队活学活用毛主席著作，加速部队思想革命化会是极大的促进。团党委研究决定，全团停工三天，广泛开展学习王杰的活动。当时，有的同志反映：眼下时间比金子还宝贵，怎么能停工？宋孔广也曾想到，停工三天会暂时影响营建进度，但是他认为，通过学王杰，部队毛泽东思想红旗举得更高了，精神的力量转化为物质的力量，丢失的时间是会抢回来的。他坚定地说：“营房建设要紧，但是思想革命化的建设更要紧。宁肯让物质的东西暂时受损失，绝不能让精神的东西受损失！”事实证明，部队学习了王杰一不怕苦二不怕死的革命精神，提高了觉悟，鼓舞了干劲，大大加快了营建进度，提前完成了任务。毛主席说：“……如果只限于一般号召，而领导人员没有具体地直接地从若干组织将所号召的工作深入实施，突破一点，取得经验，然后利用这种经验去指导其他单位，就无法考验自己提出的一般号召是否正确，也无法充实一般号召的内容，就有使一般号召归于落空的危险。”宋孔广牢牢记着毛主席的这一教导。在长期的实践中，他深深体会到，要使毛泽东思想在部队扎下深根，在一切工作中真正落实，领导上不能满足于一般的动员号召。必须踏踏实实地深入基层，进行艰苦细致的工作。为了抓深抓细，他到这个团不到一年时间，就跑遍了全团各个角落，在四个连队长期蹲过点，百分之七十五的时间是生活在基层，和全团连以上主管干部都交过心谈过话。
    在阶级斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，是打牢部队思想革命化“墙基”的根本途径。宋孔广反复学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，深深懂得，我们不仅要学会与拿枪的敌人作斗争的本领，还要学会与不拿枪的敌人作斗争的本领。斗争，就要掌握武器，最锐利的武器是毛泽东思想。实践最能锻炼人，通过阶级斗争的实践，可以把部队的毛泽东思想水平大大提高一步。因此，在无产阶级文化大革命中，他和党委专门作了研究，党委成员下到连队，和干部战士一起学习毛主席著作，积极参加批判反革命修正主义分子和反动的资产阶级学术“权威”的斗争。在这场阶级斗争的实践中，干部战士进一步体会到，毛泽东思想是革命群众的命根子，阶级敌人越是疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，我们便越是要紧紧地掌握毛泽东思想，坚决地捍卫毛泽东思想。大家自觉地用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂。毛泽东思想在干部战士的头脑里根子扎得更深了。
    宋孔广坚定不移地高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，始终如一地狠抓部队的政治思想建设，使全团出现了新的局面。四好连队稳步上升，五好标兵大量涌现，像共产主义战士张红兵那样可歌可泣的英雄模范人物，数不尽，赞不绝，一代共产主义新人正在迅速成长。
    不久前，林彪同志指示全军，要适应我国无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段，军队一定要真正成为毛泽东思想的大学校。宋孔广所在的团热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决执行林彪同志的指示，奔赴新的“战场”，担负起垦田兼农的战斗任务。并且在新的战斗中掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。他们决心遵循着毛主席指引的方向，沿着非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的道路阔步前进。
