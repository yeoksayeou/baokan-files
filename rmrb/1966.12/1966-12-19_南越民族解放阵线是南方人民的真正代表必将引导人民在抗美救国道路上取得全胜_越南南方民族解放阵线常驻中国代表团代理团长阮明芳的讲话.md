First of all, allow me to represent the South Vietnam National Liberation Front's delegation in China to extend the warmest greetings of unity and struggle to the representatives and friends present, and to convey the most sincere greetings of the people of South Vietnam to the fraternal people of China. I express my heartfelt thanks to the guests from various countries attending today's meeting and request you to convey the most fervent greetings of the people of South Vietnam to your respective peoples. I also express my heartfelt thanks to the Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, various people's organizations in China, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army for organizing today's meeting to condemn the U.S. imperialist bombing of Hanoi and to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Comrades and friends,

In recent days, the entire people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam have been filled with indignation over the U.S. imperialists' continuous bombing of the capital city of Hanoi in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This provocation against the 31 million Vietnamese people, against the entire socialist camp, and against all progressive humanity has once again exposed the aggressive and warlike nature of U.S. imperialism, completely unmasking the "peace" smokescreen being spread by the Johnson administration, and adding new bloody crimes to its record of aggression against Vietnam.

The U.S. imperialists attempt, through this new "escalation," to threaten the indomitable fighting spirit of the people of South Vietnam, to save their precarious situation, and to force the people of South Vietnam to lay down their arms and surrender. This is a pipe dream. The U.S. imperialists' bombing of the heart of the entire Vietnamese nation, Hanoi, is an affront to the sacred feelings of the entire Vietnamese nation, further igniting the flames of hatred among the military and people of South Vietnam, and giving them the punishment they deserve. Playing with fire will only burn oneself. Blood debts must be repaid with blood. The military and people of South Vietnam are not afraid. They only know how to fight to the end and win. The military and people of South Vietnam have fulfilled their ironclad warning to the U.S. imperialists with their glorious victories on the battlefield, fulfilling their sacred oath to their beloved northern brethren: "For every aggression against the North, the military and people of the South will strike back five times, ten times harder."

The military and people of South Vietnam have enthusiastically responded to the statement issued by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 14, 1966, and the statement issued by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on December 15, 1966, determined to charge into battle, fight bravely, and deal heavier blows to the U.S. imperialists, better avenge the compatriots of the capital Hanoi and the beloved people of the North, and fulfill their great and glorious duty to the rear areas of the entire country.

Comrades and friends,

For more than twelve years, U.S. imperialism has waged the most brutal and bloody war of aggression in the world today in South Vietnam. In this dirty war of aggression, U.S. imperialism has mobilized the entire modern war machine of the most economically and militarily powerful country within the imperialist camp, deploying nearly 500,000 U.S. and puppet troops, as well as 500,000 puppet troops raised by the U.S., to oppose the self-determination, national independence, and freedom of the people of South Vietnam. They have not hesitated to use all kinds of savage and barbaric methods, from medieval torture and killing to modern warfare weapons and tools, including those prohibited by international law. U.S. imperialism has used napalm bombs, phosphorus bombs, chemical poisons, and gases on a large scale in South Vietnam to massacre people, kill livestock, and destroy crops and trees. The number of our compatriots killed, tortured, imprisoned, or maimed by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys has reached nearly 1.5 million, a figure that speaks volumes about their extremely savage and heinous crimes.

U.S. imperialism, regardless of world opinion and American public opinion, has openly declared that the war it is waging in South Vietnam is not only to occupy South Vietnam but also to gain experience to suppress the patriotic movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

It is clear that the U.S. aggressors are a group of bloodthirsty, evil demons, even more savage than the fascists of Hitler's time. Their extremely savage crimes have outraged every person of conscience in the world. U.S. imperialism is the number one war criminal in the world today. It is not only the sworn enemy of the Vietnamese people but also the sworn enemy of the peoples of all nations.

Comrades and friends,

Faced with the aggressive plots and actions of U.S. imperialism, the people of South Vietnam have no other choice but to rise up, unite as one, and take up arms to decisively defeat the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, using revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence, and using a patriotic war against an aggressive war.

The resolute and widespread struggle of the people of South Vietnam led to the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on December 20, 1960. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is a banner that has united all patriotic forces from all classes, groups, parties, religions, and ethnicities to struggle for the fundamental demands proposed in the program of the Liberation Front: independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and ultimately the unification of the country. The founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is a major historical event that marks a major turning point in the liberation struggle of the people of South Vietnam.

Under the sacred banner of national salvation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the people of South Vietnam have creatively combined political struggle with armed struggle, combined the countryside with the cities, and launched a powerful and comprehensive people's war against the enemy from the military, political, and logistics fronts, making all military and political plans of U.S. imperialism suffer defeat.

In the past period, the people of South Vietnam have achieved extremely important strategic victories.

First, the victory of the widespread mass struggle movement from 1959 to 1960. Through the combination of political violence and armed activities, the foundation of the U.S. imperialist lackey, the dictatorial regime of Ngo Dinh Diem, which had more than 300,000 puppet troops, was destroyed, revolutionary power was established in the countryside and mountainous areas, and the enemy's plot to eliminate the revolutionary forces in the South and the plan to advance northward were both foiled.

The second victory was the complete smashing of the U.S. imperialist "special war" strategy (1961-1964) with 600,000 puppet troops and 30,000 U.S. advisors, annihilating tens of thousands of puppet troops and U.S. advisors, destroying thousands of "strategic hamlets," and liberating four-fifths of the land and 10 million people from enemy control, making the enemy's attempt to achieve a quick victory fail and forcing the enemy's strategy to shift from "special war" to "limited war."

The third victory was the defeat of the 1965-1966 "dry season strategic counteroffensive," which served as the prelude to the U.S. limited war, involving 800,000 reactionary armed forces, including more than 200,000 U.S. troops. The enemy's plan to annihilate the main forces of the Liberation Army, encroach on the liberated areas, consolidate the puppet army and puppet government, and isolate and annihilate the revolutionary forces in the South was foiled. In the great victories of the 1965-1966 dry season, the military and people of South Vietnam annihilated nearly 50,000 U.S. troops and 70,000 puppet troops, completely wiped out 35 regiments, including 14 U.S. regiments. This is a victory of great significance, indicating that the military and people of South Vietnam have not only defeated and disintegrated the puppet army but are also defeating the most ferocious army in the capitalist world today, equipped with the latest weapons and equipment—the U.S. expeditionary forces.

From 1961 to September 30, 1966, nearly six years, the military and people of South Vietnam have annihilated more than 850,000 enemy troops, including more than 110,000 U.S. and allied troops. In just the first nine months of 1966, the military and people of South Vietnam annihilated more than 200,000 enemy troops, including nearly 90,000 U.S. and allied troops, completely wiped out 27 infantry regiments, 9 armored brigades, 212 companies, and 295 platoons, shot down and destroyed 1,651 aircraft, destroyed 2,570 various military vehicles, and forced the enemy to abandon 150 strongholds.

In recent days, the military and people of South Vietnam have responded to the call issued by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on October 27, 1966, launching continuous attacks and striking hard and accurately at the U.S. puppet troops and allied forces. According to incomplete statistics, in November 1966 alone, the military and people of South Vietnam annihilated 11,400 enemy troops, including more than 6,000 U.S. and allied troops. In the first round of the second dry season counteroffensive plan, they defeated the U.S. aggressors. Guerrilla warfare has developed strongly and widely, forming iron rings tightly surrounding the enemy, capable of consuming and annihilating the enemy. While engaging in armed activities, the people of South Vietnam are also attacking the enemy politically, causing the puppet army and puppet government to further disintegrate and become chaotic. In just the first nine months of 1966, 360 million people in the countryside of South Vietnam participated in the struggle, firmly opposing the enemy's plot to "pacify the countryside" and the large-scale sweeping, suppression, bombing, and chemical poisoning. The struggle movement in the cities is also flourishing, while the contradictions within the enemy have become even more severe.

With political and military victories, the liberated areas under the control of the Liberation Front are being continuously consolidated and expanded. In the liberated four-fifths of the land, a healthy, happy, and democratic new life is being built everywhere. Farmers have been allocated 2 million hectares of land. Self-sufficiency in production is developing; thousands of schools from primary to university levels have accepted tens of thousands of students; thousands of health stations, medical teams, and cultural troupes are active day and night in various places in the liberated areas. In all liberated areas, the people have established self-governing committees, built combat villages, organized militia and guerrilla forces, and guarded their hometowns day and night, determined not to let the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys return. In the liberated areas surrounding the U.S. military bases, even around Saigon, a fierce campaign to annihilate the Americans and save the country is being carried out.

Comrades and friends,

The reality in South Vietnam proves that the increase in U.S. troops in South Vietnam cannot help it find a way out of the "dead end." The more U.S. troops there are, the more they die, the more passive they become, and the deeper they sink. On the contrary, the military and people of South Vietnam are fighting stronger and stronger, and the greater the victory. This reality also proves that under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the military and people of South Vietnam, firmly grasping the line of people's war, have full confidence in defeating the U.S. aggressors militarily and politically under any circumstances.

Comrades and friends,

The victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in all aspects are inseparable from the glorious victories of the military and people of the North, who are blood brothers. In the nearly two years of confrontation with the military and people of North Vietnam, in terms of their fundamental goals, the U.S. imperialists' war of destruction using air power has failed. The more than 1,600 U.S. aircraft shot down in North Vietnam have made the so-called "U.S. air superiority" bankrupt. Despite encountering many difficulties in production and combat, the people of North Vietnam continue to push forward the cause of socialist construction, continuously increasing their economic and defense strength, ensuring the needs of the people, and at the same time fully supporting the revolution in the South, fulfilling their duty to the rear areas for the front lines.

On the occasion of celebrating the six-year victories of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the people of South Vietnam enthusiastically acclaim the great victories and glorious achievements of their blood brothers in the North in combat and production, feeling proud and greatly inspired.

Comrades and friends,

The struggle of the Vietnamese people is just, aimed at liberating their own territory and making an active contribution to the national liberation movement and the defense of world peace. Therefore, the people of the world, including the American people, stand on the side of the Vietnamese people and support them. The international prestige of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is increasing. Many countries have already recognized the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the sole legitimate representative of the 14 million people of South Vietnam and have established formal diplomatic relations with the Liberation Front. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has established permanent representative offices in many countries. The people of South Vietnam highly value the precious sympathy and support of the world's people and regard it as a great encouragement and an important factor in achieving complete victory for the revolution in South Vietnam.

On this occasion, I express the deep gratitude of the people of South Vietnam to the people of the socialist countries and the people of all countries in the world who enthusiastically support the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam. We warmly welcome and thank the American people who resolutely and bravely oppose the U.S. government's policy of aggression and war in Vietnam.

Comrades and friends,

China and Vietnam are two neighboring countries that are closely connected. The people of South Vietnam, with deep feelings and happy hearts, always pay close attention to and watch the great achievements of the fraternal Chinese people in their revolutionary and national construction. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government lead the Chinese people to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, self-reliance, hard work, overcoming various difficulties and obstacles, and building China into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, agriculture, national defense, and advanced science and technology. The most outstanding symbol of this is the successful test of the third atomic bomb and nuclear missile weapons containing thermonuclear materials.

The revolutionary struggle history of the Chinese people, the spirit of self-reliance in building the country, and the resolute opposition to imperialism led by the United States are shining examples for the Vietnamese people and all peoples of the world.

The people of South Vietnam warmly congratulate the great victories achieved by the Chinese people and wish you even greater victories and the successful completion of the Third Five-Year Plan.

The people of South Vietnam fully support the Chinese government's opposition to the U.S. imperialists' plot to create two Chinas and demand the restoration of its legitimate position in the United Nations. We firmly support the struggle of the Chinese people to liberate the sacred territory of Taiwan, the People's Republic of China.

We strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' continuous attacks on Chinese fishing boats and merchant ships and demand that the U.S. imperialists immediately stop these war provocations against the People's Republic of China.

We strongly protest the savage persecution and massacre of Chinese people in Macao by the Portuguese authorities and demand that the Portuguese authorities immediately stop these crimes, severely punish the culprits, immediately release the arrested persons, and compensate for all the losses caused.

In the arduous and just struggle of patriotism, the people of South Vietnam have received the sympathy and the most resolute, powerful, and effective support from the great Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Communist Party of China. On August 29, 1963, Chairman Mao Zedong declared: "We Chinese people are firmly supporting the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam..." In the statement issued by the Government of the People's Republic of China on July 3, 1966, it was pointed out: "Now, due to the development of the U.S. imperialist war of aggression to a new and more serious stage, our support and assistance are no longer subject to any constraints and limitations. We will take actions we deem necessary based on the interests of the Vietnamese people and the demands of the Vietnamese people." This is the common voice of 700 million Chinese people, and it is the iron will of every Chinese person. In recent years, the movement to support Vietnam and resist the U.S. has been powerfully carried out on the vast land of China. From the PLA units, factories, enterprises, communes, schools, and various strata of the Chinese people, men, women, old, and young, to young students, everyone has actively participated in the movement to support Vietnam and resist the U.S. This is a shining embodiment of the friendship and unity between the peoples of Vietnam and China.

We highly value the immense and precious support of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Communist Party of China. It is this great support, as well as the support of other brotherly countries, that has given the people of South Vietnam powerful encouragement and made an important contribution to strengthening their fighting forces.

On this occasion, please allow us to express our deep gratitude to the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Communist Party of China led by the respected Chairman Mao Zedong, on behalf of the people of South Vietnam and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Comrades and friends,

The current situation in Vietnam has become very serious due to the aggressive and warlike policies of U.S. imperialism. The U.S. imperialists, who have suffered heavy losses in their military adventures, are trying every means to get out of their predicament. They are sending a large number of U.S. expeditionary forces and allied troops to South Vietnam, increasing weapons and war materials, in order to expand the war of aggression. Currently, the number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam has increased to more than 380,000. Regarding North Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has strengthened its war of destruction using air and naval forces, continuously bombing cities, towns, villages, and densely populated areas with aircraft. Many schools, hospitals, and water conservancy projects have been destroyed. More seriously, recently, the U.S. imperialists have recklessly sent aircraft to bomb the capital city of Hanoi in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

While carrying out extremely brutal war actions against Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is also constantly provoking and destroying the independence and neutrality of the Kingdom of Cambodia, strengthening the war in Laos, and creating a very tense situation in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

Just as U.S. imperialism is frantically intensifying the war of aggression in Vietnam and Indochina, it is also repeatedly playing the old tunes of "peace talks" and "unconditional talks" to deceive public opinion and cover up its crimes. However, people have clearly seen that all the "proposals" made by U.S. imperialism so far, including Goldberg's recent remarks at the United Nations, Johnson and Rusk's remarks, and the so-called Manila Declaration, are full of hypocrisy, deception, and arrogance, that is, U.S. imperialism must insist on staying in South Vietnam, trying to maintain the puppet regime it has set up in South Vietnam, attempting to permanently divide Vietnam, and not recognizing the right of the Vietnamese people to settle their internal affairs independently. Therefore, the deceptive tricks of U.S. imperialism have been scorned by the Vietnamese people and the people of the world.

The people of South Vietnam once again warn the U.S. aggressors that all their cunning plots and threats will not make the Vietnamese nation, which has a tradition of unyielding struggle against foreign aggression, which has defeated the Japanese fascists and French colonialist invaders, and written the magnificent chapter of Dien Bien Phu, and is now fearlessly defeating U.S. imperialism, surrender. The U.S. imperialists will not be able to threaten the fighting spirit of the people of South Vietnam through the bombing of North Vietnam. The military and people of South Vietnam will resolutely implement the call issued by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on October 27, 1966, to achieve the greatest victory in the 1966-1967 winter and spring seasons, resolutely complete the tasks of liberating the South, defending the North, and unifying the country.

The U.S. imperialists are aggressors in South Vietnam and trample on the basic sovereignty of the South Vietnamese state. If the United States truly wants peace, it must stop the war of aggression in South Vietnam, withdraw U.S. and allied troops and weapons from South Vietnam, dismantle all U.S. military bases in South Vietnam, respect the national rights of the people of South Vietnam, that is, independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality; recognize the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the sole legitimate representative of the people of South Vietnam, and the Liberation Front has its position and decisive voice in all political solutions related to the Vietnamese issue. At the same time, the United States must permanently and unconditionally stop the war of destruction against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam using air power. There is no other way.

After more than twenty years of continuous fighting against imperialist wars of aggression, the Vietnamese people love peace very much and hope to live happily and build their country. However, the Vietnamese people also clearly understand that only on the basis of true independence and freedom can there be true peace. Only by fighting resolutely to resist the U.S. imperialist war of aggression can there be peace. As long as U.S. imperialism does not give up its aggressive ambitions, the people of South Vietnam will resolutely fight to the end and definitely achieve their goal: liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately unify the country. The wishes and iron will of the Vietnamese people have been clearly expressed in the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. This is the correct basis for solving the Vietnamese issue. This is the true stance of peace. The U.S. imperialists are aggressors and have no right to impose any conditions on the Vietnamese people. The United Nations, controlled by U.S. imperialism, also has no right to interfere in the Vietnamese issue. For independence, freedom, and the unification of the country, the Vietnamese people are determined to defeat the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism and are confident of final victory.

Comrades and friends,

The past six years have been six years of extremely heroic struggle and six years of extremely glorious victories for the people of South Vietnam. These great victories show that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has completed and is completing its historical mission. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the decisive factor and force in the development of the situation in South Vietnam, the organizer and leader of the heroic struggle of the people of South Vietnam. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has become such an organization that it performs the functions of a truly democratic and strong state of the people of South Vietnam. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam enjoys great influence and high prestige internationally and is loved and praised by friends from the five continents.

All this shows that it is the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and only the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, that is the sole legitimate representative of the 14 million people of South Vietnam, leading the revolution in South Vietnam from victory to victory on the path of resistance against American aggression and national salvation, and will definitely achieve complete victory.

On the occasion of the enthusiastic celebration of the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on December 20, 1966, the people of South Vietnam are extremely happy with their victories and have recognized the difficulties that must be overcome, determined to continue the struggle and strive for greater victories. The people of South Vietnam are not afraid of hardships and sacrifices and are determined to complete the glorious task for their beloved country together with the 17 million blood brothers in the North. The people of South Vietnam are determined to fulfill their sacred international duty, that is, to defeat the U.S. imperialist war of aggression in South Vietnam and make a contribution to the common struggle of the world's people for national independence, democracy, peace, and social progress.

The current situation in South Vietnam shows a bright prospect for the anti-American and national salvation struggle of the people of South Vietnam. The strength of the people of South Vietnam and North Vietnam in all aspects is unprecedentedly growing and strengthening. The glorious victories of the Vietnamese military and people have put the U.S. aggressors in a state of failure and desperation. The Vietnamese people will definitely win, and U.S. imperialism will definitely lose.

South Vietnam will definitely achieve independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. Vietnam will definitely be unified.

Long live the unbreakable unity and fighting friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China!

Long live the spirit of unity and struggle of the revolutionary peoples of the world who are fighting for national independence, democracy, peace, and social progress!

    南越民族解放阵线是南方人民的真正代表必将引导人民在抗美救国道路上取得全胜
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长阮明芳的讲话
    首先，请允许我代表越南南方民族解放阵线驻华代表团向在座的各位代表和朋友们，向兄弟的中国人民致越南南方人民最亲切的团结战斗的敬礼。我向出席今天大会的各国来宾表示衷心的感谢，并请你们向贵国人民转达越南南方人民最热烈的敬意。我也向组织今天声讨美帝国主义轰炸河内和庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年大会的中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中国各人民团体和中国人民解放军表示衷心的感谢。
    各位代表和各位朋友，
    近几天来，越南南方全体人民和越南南方民族解放阵线对美帝国主义连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市区，悍然向三千一百万越南人民挑衅，向整个社会主义阵营挑衅和向整个进步人类挑衅，感到无比愤怒。美帝国主义这一挑衅，再一次暴露了它的侵略和好战的面目，完全揭穿了约翰逊集团正在放出的“和平”烟幕，在它侵略越南的罪状中又增加了新的血腥罪行。
    美帝国主义企图通过这一新的“升级”可以威胁越南南方人民英勇不屈的斗争精神，挽救它的岌岌可危的处境，妄图通过轰炸越南北方，轰炸首都河内，迫使越南南方人民放下武器，向它投降。这是白日作梦。美帝国主义轰炸整个越南民族的心脏河内，就是触犯了整个越南民族的神圣感情，更加激发了越南南方军民的仇恨烈火，给予它以应有的惩罚。玩火必自焚。血债要用血来还。越南南方军民从不畏惧，他们只知道决战决胜。越南南方军民以在战场上的显赫战功，兑现了他们对美帝国主义斩钉截铁的警告，实现了他们对骨肉的北方的神圣誓言，这就是：“只要美帝国主义侵犯北方一次，南方军民就决心要五倍、十倍地狠狠回击他们”。
    越南南方军民热烈响应越南民主共和国政府一九六六年十二月十四日的声明和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会十二月十五日的声明，决心冲锋陷阵，英勇战斗，给美帝国主义更沉重的打击，更好地为首都河内的同胞，为亲爱的北方同胞报仇，履行自己对全国的大后方的重大而光荣的义务。
    各位代表和各位朋友们，
    十二年多以来，美帝国主义在越南南方进行了一场当前世界上最残酷的、血腥的侵略战争。在这场肮脏的侵略战争里，美帝国主义开动了帝国主义阵营内一个拥有最强大的经济力量和军事力量的国家的整个现代战争机器，出动了近五十万美国及其仆从国军队，以及由美国豢养的五十万伪军，来反对越南南方人民的自决权、民族独立和自由的权利。它们不惜采取一切野蛮残暴的手段，从中世纪式的拷打和杀人方法到现代化的各种战争武器和工具，包括国际法禁止使用的手段。美帝国主义在越南南方大规模地使用凝固汽油弹、磷弹、化学毒剂和毒气来残杀人民、杀害家畜，毁坏庄稼和树木。被美帝国主义及其走狗杀害、拷打、监禁或致残废的我们的同胞，已近一百五十万人，这个数字说明了它们的极其野蛮的滔天罪行。
    美帝国主义不顾世界舆论和美国舆论的反对，竟公然宣称，它在越南南方进行的战争不仅是为了侵占越南南方，而且也是为了取得经验来镇压亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各民族的爱国运动。
    很明显，美国侵略者表明了它们是一群嗜血成性的凶恶的魔鬼，更甚于当年的希特勒法西斯，它们所犯的极其野蛮的罪行，使世界上每一个有良知的人都感到愤慨。美帝国主义是当前世界上的头号战犯，它不仅是越南人民不共戴天的敌人，而且也是世界各民族不共戴天的敌人。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    面对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋和行动，我们越南南方人民没有别的办法，只有起来，团结一致，万众一心，拿起武器，坚决打败美国侵略者及其走狗，用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，用爱国战争反对侵略战争。
    越南南方人民坚决和广泛的斗争导致一九六○年十二月二十日越南南方民族解放阵线的成立。越南南方民族解放阵线是一面旗帜，它团结了各阶层、各团体、各党派、各宗教和各民族的一切爱国力量，为实现解放阵线纲领中所提出的根本主张：独立、民主、和平、中立，进而统一祖国而斗争。越南南方民族解放阵线的成立是一个重大的历史事件，它标志着越南南方人民解放斗争的重大转折。
    在越南南方民族解放阵线神圣的救国旗帜下，越南南方人民创造性地把政治斗争同武装斗争结合起来，把农村同城市结合起来，从军事、政治、兵运工作三方面向敌人展开连续进攻，发动了强大和全面的人民战争，使美帝国主义的一切军事计划和政治计划都遭到了失败。
    在过去这段时间里，越南南方人民已取得了具有战略意义的极其重大胜利。
    首先，是一九五九年到一九六○年广泛的群众斗争运动的胜利。通过政治暴力同武装活动的结合，摧毁了拥有三十多万伪军的美帝国主义的走狗吴庭艳独裁统治的基础，在农村和山区建立起革命政权，使敌人妄想消灭南方革命力量的阴谋和北进计划遭到失败。
    第二个胜利是彻底粉碎了美帝国主义用六十万名伪军和三万名美国顾问进行的“特种战争”战略（一九六一——一九六四），消灭了数以十万计的伪军和美国顾问，捣毁了成千个“战略村”，把五分之四的土地和一千万人民从敌人的控制下解放出来，使敌人速战速决的企图失败了，迫使敌人的战略从“特种战争”转为“局部战争”。
    第三个胜利是打败作为美国局部战争序幕的、有八十万反动武装力量，包括二十多万美军参加的一九六五——一九六六年“旱季战略反攻”，粉碎了敌人妄图消灭解放军的有生力量，蚕食解放区，巩固伪军和伪政权，孤立并消灭南方革命力量的计划。在一九六五——一九六六年旱季大捷中，越南南方军民消灭了近五万名美军、七万名伪军，全歼了三十五个营，其中有十四营美军。这是具有十分重大意义的胜利，它表明越南南方军民不仅打败和瓦解了伪军，而且正在打败当前资本主义世界中拥有各种最新式武器装备的一支穷凶极恶的军队——美国远征军。
    从一九六一年到一九六六年九月底的将近六年的时间里，越南南方军民已歼灭了八十五万多名敌军，其中有十一万多名美军和仆从军。仅在一九六六年头九个月里，越南南方军民消灭了二十多万名敌军，其中包括近九万名美军及其仆从军，全歼二十七个步兵营、九个装甲分团、二百一十二个连和二百九十五个排，击落和击毁一千六百五十一架飞机，击毁二千五百七十辆各种军车，迫使敌人放弃了一百五十个据点。
    近日来，越南南方军民响应越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六六年十月二十七日的号召，连连发动进攻，狠狠地、准准地打击美伪军和美国仆从军。据不完全统计，仅在一九六六年十一月份，越南南方军民已歼灭了一万一千四百名敌人，其中有六千多名美国及其仆从军。在第二次旱季反攻计划的第一个回合中打败了美国强盗。游击战争有了强大和广泛的发展，形成了一道道钢铁般的包围圈，紧紧围住敌人，能够消耗和消灭敌人。在武装活动的同时，越南南方人民还在政治方面进攻敌人，促使伪军和伪政权进一步瓦解和混乱。仅在一九六六年的头九个月里，越南南方农村有三百六十万人次参加斗争，坚决反对敌人“绥靖农村”的阴谋和大肆进行扫荡、镇压、轰炸、撒放化学毒剂等手段。城市里的斗争运动也在蓬勃发展，同时，敌人内部本来就已经严重的矛盾就更加严重了。
    随着政治上和军事上的节节胜利，解放阵线所控制的解放区在不断巩固和扩大。在解放了的五分之四的土地上，到处都在建设着健康的、愉快的和民主的新生活。农民分到了二百万公顷的土地。生产自给日益发展；成千所从小学到大学的各级学校接受了数以十万计的学生；成万个卫生站、医疗组和文工队正在解放区各地日夜活动着。所有解放了的地方，人民都成立了自治委员会，建立起战斗村，组织民兵游击队，日夜守卫家乡，决不让美帝国主义及其走狗卷土重来。在包围着美军基地的解放区，甚至在西贡市周围，正在轰轰烈烈地开展着歼美救国竞赛运动。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    越南南方的现实证明，美帝国主义增兵越南南方，也丝毫不能帮助它在“死胡同”里找到一线光明。美军增加得越多，就死得越多，就越被动，就陷得越深。相反，越南南方军民越战越强，越强胜利越大。这一现实还证明，越南南方军民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，紧紧掌握人民战争的路线，不管在什么情况下，都有充分的把握在军事上和政治上战胜美国侵略强盗。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    越南南方人民在各方面取得的胜利是同他们血肉相连的北方军民的辉煌胜利分不开的。在同越南北方军民较量了近两年以来，就其基本目标来看，美帝国主义用空军进行的破坏性战争已经失败。在越南北方被打落的一千六百多架美国飞机已使得所谓的“美国空中优势”破产了。尽管在生产中和战斗中遇到了许多困难，越南北方人民仍继续把社会主义建设事业推向前进，不断增加经济和国防力量，保证人民的需要，同时也是为了全心全意支援南方的革命，尽到大后方对大前方所应尽的义务。
    在庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线六年来的胜利的时候，越南南方人民热烈欢呼骨肉的北方同胞在战斗中和生产中所取得的巨大胜利和辉煌战功，并以此感到自豪，同时受到莫大鼓舞。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    越南人民的斗争是正义的，是为了自己解放自己的国土，并为全世界民族解放运动和保卫世界和平作出积极的贡献。正因为这样，所以世界人民，包括美国人民都站在越南人民一边，支持越南人民。越南南方民族解放阵线在国际上的威望日益提高。许多国家已经承认越南南方民族解放阵线是一千四百万越南南方人民唯一真正的代表，并同解放阵线建立了正式外交关系。越南南方民族解放阵线已在许多国家里设立了常驻代表团。对于世界人民这种珍贵的同情和支持，越南南方人民给予高度的评价，并视之为巨大的鼓舞和促使越南南方的革命取得完全胜利的重要因素。
    借此机会，我向热情支持越南南方人民的正义斗争的社会主义各国人民和全世界各国人民表达越南南方人民的深切谢意。我们对坚决和英勇地反对美国政府在越南奉行侵略和战争政策的美国人民表示热烈的欢迎和感谢。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    中国和越南是两个唇齿相依的邻邦。越南南方人民怀着深刻的感情和非常高兴的心情，时刻关心和注视着兄弟的中国人民在革命和建设祖国的事业中所取得的巨大成就。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，中国共产党和中国政府领导中国人民，发扬不断革命的精神，自力更生，辛勤劳动，克服各种困难和障碍，把中国建设成一个具有现代工业、农业、国防和先进的科学技术的强大的社会主义国家，其最突出的标志是第三颗含有热核材料的原子弹和导弹核武器的试验成功。
    中国人民的革命斗争历史，自力更生地建设祖国的精神，坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义的意志，是越南人民和全世界各民族的光辉榜样。
    越南南方人民热烈祝贺中国人民所取得的伟大胜利，并预祝你们取得更加巨大的胜利，并胜利地完成第三个五年计划。
      越南南方人民完全支持中国政府反对美帝国主义企图制造两个中国的阴谋，要求恢复它在联合国的正当地位的立场。我们坚决支持中国人民为解放中华人民共和国的神圣领土台湾而进行的斗争。
    我们强烈谴责美帝国主义连续袭击中国渔船和商船的行为，并要求美帝国主义立即停止对中华人民共和国的这一战争挑衅行动。
    我们强烈抗议葡萄牙当局野蛮迫害和屠杀在澳门的中国人，要求葡萄牙当局立即停止这种罪行，严厉惩办罪魁祸首，立即释放被捕的人，并赔偿它所造成的一切损失。
    在充满艰苦牺牲的爱国正义斗争中，越南南方人民得到伟大的中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党所给以的同情和最坚决、有力和有效的支持。一九六三年八月二十九日，毛泽东主席已经声明：“我们中国人民是坚决支持越南南方人民的正义斗争的……”中华人民共和国政府在一九六六年七月三日的声明中，肯定指出：“现在，由于美帝国主义侵略战争发展到了一个新的更加严重的阶段，使我们的这种支持和援助，更加不受任何约束和限制。我们将根据越南人民的利益，根据越南人民的要求，随时采取我们认为必要的行动。”这是七亿中国人民的共同声音，这是每一个中国人民的钢铁意志。几年来，援越抗美运动在辽阔的中国土地上有力地开展着。从解放军部队、工厂、企业、公社、学校、中国各阶层人民，男女老幼，到少年学生，每个人都积极投入援越抗美运动。这是越中两国人民团结和战斗的情谊的光辉体现。
    我们对中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党这种无比巨大和珍贵的支持给予很高的评价。正是这种巨大的支持，以及其他兄弟国家的支持，对越南南方人民给予了有力的鼓舞，并对增强他们的战斗力量作出了重要的贡献。
    借此机会，请允许我们向中国人民、中国政府和以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党，表示越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的深切谢意。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    目前越南的局势由于美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策而变得十分严重。在军事冒险的道路上遭到了惨重失败的美帝国主义，正在千方百计摆脱困境。它向越南南方大力增派美国远征军及其仆从军、增加武器和作战物资，以便扩大侵略战争。目前在越南南方的美军已增加到三十八万多人。对于越南北方，美帝国主义加强了用空军和海军进行的破坏性战争，不断用飞机轰炸城市、集镇、村庄和居民集中的地区。许多学校、医院和水利工程都被毁坏。更严重的是，最近美帝国主义冒险地连续派飞机轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市区。
    在对越南采取极其残暴的战争行动的同时，美帝国主义还不断对柬埔寨王国的独立和中立进行挑衅和破坏，加强老挝战争，在印度支那和东南亚造成了极其紧张的局势。
    正当美帝国主义在越南和印度支那疯狂加紧侵略战争的时候，它又喋喋不休地弹起“和平谈判”、“无条件谈判”的陈词滥调，以欺骗舆论和掩盖其罪行。但是，人们都清楚地看到，美帝国主义先后所提出的所有“建议”，包括戈德堡最近在联合国发出的论调，约翰逊和腊斯克的论调，以及所谓马尼拉会议的声明，都充满着虚伪、欺骗和蛮横的内容，即：美帝国主义一定要赖在越南南方，竭力维持它在南越一手扶植起来的傀儡集团，力图长期分裂越南，不承认越南人民的自行解决内部事务的权利。因此，美帝国主义的欺骗伎俩遭到越南人民和世界人民的唾弃。
    越南南方人民再一次正告美国侵略者，它们的一切狡诈阴谋和威胁手段，决不能使有着反抗外来侵略的不屈不挠的斗争传统，曾经打败日本法西斯、法国殖民主义侵略者，写下了雄伟的奠边府史篇，并正在无所畏惧地战胜美帝国主义的越南民族屈服。美帝国主义休想通过对越南北方的轰炸来威胁越南南方人民的斗志。越南南方军民坚决实现越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会一九六六年十月二十七日发出的夺取一九六六——一九六七年冬春季的最大胜利的号召，坚决完成解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国的任务。
    美帝国主义在越南南方是侵略者，是越南南方国家基本主权的践踏者。如果美国真正希望和平，它就必须停止对越南南方的侵略战争，把美国及其仆从国的军队和武器撤出越南南方，撤除美国在越南南方的所有军事基地，必须尊重越南南方人民的民族权利，即：独立、民主、和平、中立；必须承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民唯一的真正代表，民族解放阵线在有关越南问题的一切政治解决中有它的地位和决定性的发言权，同时美国还必须永远和无条件地停止用空军对越南民主共和国进行的破坏性战争。除此之外，没有其他别的道路。
    经历了二十多年反对帝国主义侵略战争的连续战斗，越南人民非常热爱和平，非常希望能愉快和幸福地生活以便建设自己的国家。但是，越南人民也非常清楚地懂得，只有在真正的独立自由基础上，才能有真正的和平。只有进行坚决的斗争，抵抗美帝国主义的侵略战争，才能有和平。美帝国主义一天不放弃侵略野心，越南南方人民就坚决战斗到底，一定要达到自己的目的：解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。越南人民的愿望和钢铁意志已经清楚地体现在越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明中。这是解决越南问题的最正确的基础。这是真正的和平立场。美帝国主义是侵略者，根本没有权利向越南人民提出任何条件。美帝国主义控制下的工具联合国，也根本没有权利干涉越南问题。为了独立、自由和统一祖国，越南人民决心打败美帝国主义的侵略政策，并对最后胜利满怀信心。
    各位代表和朋友们：
    过去的六年是越南南方人民无比英勇战斗的六年，同时也是取得极其辉煌胜利的六年。这些巨大的胜利表明，越南南方民族解放阵线已经和正在完成自己的历史使命。越南南方民族解放阵线是决定越南南方局势的发展的决定因素和力量，是越南南方人民英勇战斗的组织者和领导者。越南南方民族解放阵线已成为这样一个组织，它执行着越南南方人民真正民主和坚强国家的职能。越南南方民族解放阵线在国际上享有巨大的影响和很高的威望，受到五大洲的朋友们的爱戴和赞扬。
    所有这一切表明，正是越南南方民族解放阵线，也只有越南南方民族解放阵线，才是一千四百万越南南方人民唯一的真正代表，在抗战救国的道路上，它引导越南南方革命从胜利走向胜利，并必将取得完全胜利。
    在热烈庆祝一九六六年十二月二十日越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年的时候，越南南方人民对自己的胜利感到无比高兴，并认清了必须克服的困难，决心连续战斗，争取更大的胜利。越南南方人民不怕艰苦牺牲，决心同一千七百万北方骨肉同胞一起，完成对亲爱的祖国所承担的光荣任务。越南南方人民决心履行自己崇高的国际义务，这就是打败美帝国主义在越南南方的侵略战争，为世界人民争取民族独立、民主、和平和社会进步的共同斗争作出贡献。
    越南南方目前的形势对越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争正展示着光明的前景。越南南方和北方人民在各方面的力量都在空前地成长壮大。越南军民的辉煌胜利使美国侵略者陷于失败和绝境。越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必败。
    越南南方一定取得独立、民主、和平、中立。越南一定统一。
    越中两国人民牢不可破的团结和战斗的友谊万岁！
    为民族独立、民主、和平和社会进步而斗争的全世界革命人民团结战斗的精神万岁！
