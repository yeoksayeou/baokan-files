On November 30, the last day of the track and field events at the First Asian New Forces Games, China's famous high jumper Ni Zhiqun cleared a height of 2.27 meters. This surpassed his national record of 2.26 meters set in May this year and was just one centimeter short of the world record, making him the highest jumper in the world since 1963.

When this exhilarating news was broadcast and the Chinese national flag was raised, the Cambodian National Stadium erupted in thunderous applause and cheers, celebrating his contribution to the glory of the First Asian New Forces Games.

On the afternoon of the 30th, the stands next to the high jump pit at the National Stadium were packed with thousands of spectators, all directing their hopeful gazes at the Chinese high jumper Ni Zhiqun. At 24 years old, Ni Zhiqun was the high jump champion of the First New Forces Games and the holder of China's highest high jump record.

Around 3 PM, the athletes from various countries participating in the high jump event began their warm-up exercises. At this time, Ni Zhiqun was deeply engrossed in reading the radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He repeatedly studied Mao Zedong's teachings: "We must eliminate all weak and cowardly thoughts within ourselves. Any view that overestimates the enemy's strength and underestimates the people's strength is wrong." For Ni Zhiqun, this quote from Chairman Mao was something he had studied countless times. Today, he used it to continue to spur and inspire himself, striving for greater victories for his country and the revolutionary people of the Asian New Forces.

Ni Zhiqun's first attempt was at a height of 1.90 meters, which he cleared effortlessly. He then consecutively cleared heights of 1.95, 2.00, 2.10, 2.14, 2.18, and 2.23 meters, all on his first attempt. At this point, two judges fixed the bar at 2.27 meters. Ni Zhiqun clearly understood that the 2.27-meter bar was the mark to break the national record (2.25 meters) and the starting point to challenge the world record (2.28 meters). Facing a bar that was 43 centimeters higher than his own height, Ni Zhiqun loudly read another quote from Chairman Mao: "All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must never relax their fighting spirit. Any thought of relaxing the fighting spirit or underestimating the enemy is wrong." With very coordinated movements, he dashed towards the bar. With a mighty leap, his body soared over the bar like a swallow. The stands immediately erupted in enthusiastic applause.

As darkness fell, at Ni Zhiqun's request, the judges raised the bar to 2.29 meters under the illumination of the stadium lights. Ni Zhiqun began his attempt to break the world record. However, due to a knee injury sustained during his first attempt, despite his immense willpower, he failed to clear the height after three attempts. Ni Zhiqun's tenacious spirit was met with enthusiastic praise from the spectators.

Ni Zhiqun's success today fully demonstrated the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past few years, his continuous improvement in high jump technique was a result of his increasing political awareness. As Ni Zhiqun himself said, "Only by raising one's ideological level can one raise the height of the jump, and the raising of one's ideological level can only be achieved through Mao Zedong Thought."

In 1963, although Ni Zhiqun won the first place in the First New Forces Games with a height of 2.01 meters, he did not reach his original level of 2.20 meters. After the competition, with the help of his leaders and comrades, he summarized his experiences and lessons. From that time on, he began to realize the importance of arming himself with Mao Zedong Thought. After the nationwide campaign to learn from the People's Liberation Army and Lei Feng, Ni Zhiqun more consciously studied the "Three Articles" in response to his own thoughts, further clarifying the purpose of competing for the revolution. Through unremitting efforts, his level continued to improve.

After accepting the glorious task of challenging the world record, Ni Zhiqun became even more strict with himself. Whenever he encountered difficulties in training, he immediately turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance, thereby improving both his ideology and technique. As a result, in 1965, he cleared a height of 2.25 meters, and then in May this year, he cleared a height of 2.26 meters.

In September this year, after deciding to participate in the Asian New Forces Games, his comrades repeatedly encouraged him, and many Red Guards also gave him many quotations from Chairman Mao, inspiring him to strive for new victories according to Chairman Mao's teachings. The Party's care and the comrades' expectations became a great driving force for his continued progress.

When Ni Zhiqun cleared the 2.27-meter height and people congratulated him on his success, he modestly said, "The high jump itself is a continuous revolution. Although 2.27 meters has been cleared, the 2.29-meter height has not yet been cleared, so how can it be said to be a success?" He is determined to advance to new heights.

    毛泽东思想的巨大威力
    ——记我国跳高运动员倪志钦创造近三年来世界最好成绩
    十一月三十日，第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会田径比赛最后一天的下午，中国著名跳高选手倪志钦跳过了二米二七的高度，超过了他在今年五月创造的二米二六的全国最好成绩，距世界纪录仅差一厘米，成为一九六三年以来世界上跳得最高的人。
    当这个振奋人心的消息从广播器传出来、中国的五星红旗冉冉升起的时候，柬埔寨国家综合体育场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声，祝贺他为第一届亚洲新运会增添了新的光彩。
    三十日下午，国家综合体育场跳高架旁边的看台上挤满了几千名观众，他们把期望的目光投在中国跳高选手倪志钦的身上。二十四岁的倪志钦，是第一届新运会的跳高冠军，也是中国跳高最高纪录保持者。
    三时许，参加跳高比赛的各国运动员开始在跳高场地上做准备活动。这时，倪志钦正聚精会神地阅读红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》。他反复地学习了毛主席的教导：“我们应当在自己内部肃清一切软弱无能的思想。一切过高地估计敌人力量和过低地估计人民力量的观点，都是错误的。”对于倪志钦来说，毛主席的这条语录不知道学过多少遍了，今天他要用这条语录来继续鞭策和鼓舞自己，为祖国、为亚洲新兴力量的革命人民，去争取更大的胜利。
    倪志钦第一次试跳的高度是一米九○，他轻松地跳过去了，接着，又连续跳过一米九五、二米、二米一○、二米一四、二米一八、二米二三的高度，也都是第一次试跳就跳过了。这时候，两名裁判员把横竿固定在二米二七的高度。倪志钦清楚地知道，二米二七横竿，是打破全国纪录（二米二五）的标志，也是向世界纪录（二米二八）冲击的起点。面对着比他自己身高还高出四十三厘米的横竿，倪志钦高声朗读了毛主席的又一段语录：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”接着，他以非常协调的动作冲向横竿，只见他用劲一提，身子像一只飞燕似的，轻松地越过了这个高度。这时，看台上立即爆发出热烈的掌声。
    天色黑下来了，在倪志钦的要求下，裁判员又在灯光照明之下，把横竿升到二米二九的高度。倪志钦开始了向世界纪录的冲击。但是，由于他第一次试跳时扭伤了膝关节，尽管他以极大的毅力连跳三次，没有能跳过这个高度。倪志钦的这种顽强精神受到观众热烈的称赞。
    倪志钦能够在今天的比赛中取得成功，充分显示了毛泽东思想的巨大威力。几年来倪志钦跳高技术水平的不断提高，是他思想觉悟不断提高的结果。正如倪志钦自己所说的：“思想高度提高，才能使跳越横竿的高度提高，而思想的高度的提高只有靠毛泽东思想。”
    一九六三年，倪志钦在第一届新运会上虽然以二米零一的成绩赢得了第一名，但是他没有跳出自己二米二○的原有水平。比赛结束后，倪志钦在领导和同志们的帮助下，总结了经验教训。从那时起，他开始认识到用毛泽东思想武装自己头脑的重要性。在全国掀起了大学解放军、大学雷锋的热潮之后，倪志钦更加自觉地针对自己的活思想反复学习“老三篇”，进一步明确了为革命而比赛的道理。他通过不懈的努力，水平不断提高。
    倪志钦在接受了向世界纪录冲击的光荣任务后，更加严格地要求自己。他在训练中遇到困难时，就立即去请教毛主席著作，从而使自己在思想和技术上有了明显的提高，结果在一九六五年跳过了二米二五的高度，接着又在今年五月间跳过了二米二六的高度。
    今年九月间，当他决定参加亚洲新运会后，同志们都一再鼓励他，许多红卫兵还送了他许多毛主席的语录，激励他按着毛主席的教导去争取新的胜利。党的关怀，同志们的期望，成为推动他继续前进的巨大力量。
    当倪志钦跳过二米二七高度、人们祝贺他的成功时，倪志钦谦虚地说：“跳高运动的本身就是不断革命，二米二七跳过了，但是二米二九的高度还没有跳过，怎么能说是成功了呢？”他决心向更新的高度前进。
