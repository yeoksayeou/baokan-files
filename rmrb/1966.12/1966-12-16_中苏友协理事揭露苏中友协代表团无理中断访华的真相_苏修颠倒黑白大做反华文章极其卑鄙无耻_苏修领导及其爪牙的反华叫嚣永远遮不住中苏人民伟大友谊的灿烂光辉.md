The Soviet revisionist leadership, after orchestrating the unreasonable interruption of the visit by the Soviet-China Friendship Association delegation to China, has recently used this incident as a pretext to launch a propaganda campaign, distorting facts and confusing right and wrong. They have shifted the blame for the delegation's interruption of their visit onto China and published anti-China articles. Kang Jimin, a member of the China-Soviet Friendship Association who accompanied the delegation throughout their visit, spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter to expose the truth behind the Soviet-China Friendship Association delegation's unreasonable interruption of their visit and to refute the Soviet side's slanderous accusations.

China consistently provided warm and friendly reception

Kang Jimin said that the delegation, led by the Soviet "Pravda" newspaper commentator Mayevsky, was invited by the China-Soviet Friendship Association according to the annual cooperation plan between the two countries' friendship associations. They arrived in China on November 2 to participate in activities celebrating the 49th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and to conduct a friendly visit. The China-Soviet Friendship Association and relevant departments, following the consistent teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, as always, valued and maintained the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. From the beginning to the end, they provided the delegation with a warm and friendly reception and did their utmost to create the most convenient conditions for the delegation's visit to China. From November 2, when the delegation arrived in China, until November 17, when they unreasonably interrupted their visit, in just 15 days, according to the delegation's wishes and mutual consultations, the Chinese side arranged for them to visit Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. The delegation participated in the celebration of the 49th anniversary of the Great October Revolution in Beijing, visited four factories, two rural people's communes, four museums, two large-scale industrial and agricultural achievement exhibitions, as well as libraries, workers' cultural palaces, and kindergartens. At the delegation's request, the Chinese side arranged for them to have discussions with revolutionary teachers and students, Red Guards, and writers from schools and universities, to meet with active members of the China-Soviet Friendship Association, and to have extensive contact with tens of thousands of Chinese workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life. Wherever the delegation went, they were warmly welcomed by the Chinese people who have deep feelings for the great Soviet people. When the delegation first appeared on Tiananmen Square, a large group of Red Guards enthusiastically surrounded them, eagerly shaking hands and asking them to convey their warm greetings to the great Soviet people. When they visited the Huangtugang People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing, the commune members warmly invited them to their homes, and some members of the delegation had heart-to-heart talks with Chinese commune members, encouraging each other to "educate our children well and not forget the past." When the delegation visited Shanghai, a worker from the delegation had a very cordial conversation with a Chinese worker, and they did not want to part ways. Later, Mayevsky forcibly pulled the worker away from the Chinese worker while he was still in the middle of his conversation. These ironclad facts must still be fresh in Mayevsky's memory, but after the delegation returned to the Soviet Union, Mayevsky shamelessly distorted the facts and fabricated lies, claiming that the delegation was "placed in extremely difficult conditions" as soon as they arrived in China and that there was a "hostile atmosphere" surrounding them. He attempted to use this to incite anti-China sentiments among the Soviet people.

Mayevsky and others repeatedly provoked incidents

Kang Jimin then listed several facts to expose that Mayevsky and others had repeatedly provoked incidents during their visit to China, even openly interfering in China's internal affairs and attacking China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and foreign policy.

When the delegation held a discussion with Red Guards from schools and universities in Beijing about the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Mayevsky and others posed dozens of questions to the Red Guards, many of which were obviously unfriendly. Although the Chinese Red Guards were somewhat dissatisfied with Mayevsky and others' attitude, they still valued the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and remained very restrained, calmly answering their questions one by one. However, Mayevsky and some members of the delegation further provoked the situation, openly slandering the Chinese Cultural Revolution as "destroying culture" and having "no connection with the proletarian revolution." The Red Guards could no longer tolerate this and had to refute them on the spot. At this point, Mayevsky turned around and accused the Red Guards of being "anti-Soviet," demonstratively leading the way to leave the scene and later making an extremely unreasonable "protest" to relevant personnel of the China-Soviet Friendship Association.

On the evening of November 7, the Soviet-China Friendship Association delegation attended a reception at the Soviet Embassy in China to celebrate the 49th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. After the reception ended, several hundred revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards from some universities in Beijing spontaneously gathered on the street in front of the Soviet Embassy to solemnly celebrate the brilliant holiday of the proletariat and revolutionary people around the world. The Red Guards presiding over the meeting said: "With boundless respect for the glorious October Revolution, with boundless love for the great Soviet people, and with boundless indignation towards modern revisionism, we enthusiastically celebrate the 49th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution." At the celebration, the Red Guards read the telegrams of congratulations from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the State Council to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Long live the Great October Socialist Revolution," "Long live the great Soviet people," "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union," and "Down with modern revisionism." The celebration was filled with the boundless revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, and the entire meeting was both solemn and lively, and orderly. However, Mayevsky blatantly ignored the facts and publicly slandered the Chinese Red Guards, claiming that they had "acted recklessly" and carried out "anti-Soviet provocations" in front of the Soviet Embassy that night.

After the delegation visited Shanghai, they themselves admitted that the visit to Shanghai was "satisfactory." However, in this situation, Mayevsky and others added fuel to the fire and insisted on unreasonably canceling the scheduled visit to Changsha the next day, insisting on changing the route to Guangzhou. When the Chinese side made great efforts to arrange for the delegation to arrive in Guangzhou, Mayevsky and others continued to provoke incidents during their visit.

On the day the delegation visited the 20th China Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou, the fair's guide explained to the delegation that China had established trade relations with more than 120 countries and regions around the world. This fair had received more than 6,000 guests from more than 60 countries and regions, surpassing any previous fair, and the total transaction amount also set a new record for all previous fairs. This situation fully demonstrated that "our friends are all over the world," and the policy of isolation and blockade against China led by the United States had completely failed. After hearing these introductions, Mayevsky and others not only did not feel happy about China's foreign trade achievements but instead openly slandered China's foreign trade policy as "not in accordance with Marxist-Leninist principles," claiming that China's trade relations with countries around the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit "undermined the will of the revolutionary people of the world." After Mayevsky and others' malicious attacks were refuted on the spot, they once again demonstratively left the scene midway, stopped the visit, and later made extremely rude accusations to the Chinese side, unreasonably deciding to unilaterally interrupt their visit to China.

Ignoring our warnings, unilaterally deciding to interrupt the visit

During the delegation's visit to China, it was precisely the time when all Chinese students in the Soviet Union were unreasonably ordered to return home by the Soviet government. The Chinese revolutionary masses and Red Guards, indignant at this, strongly protested against the Soviet revisionist leadership's deliberate worsening of Sino-Soviet relations. In this situation, Mayevsky and others, instead of reflecting on their own actions, repeatedly used the excuse that they heard someone shouting "oppose modern revisionism with the Soviet Communist Party leadership as the center" on the streets or saw slogans such as "oppose imperialism and revisionism" to blatantly distort right and wrong, confuse right and wrong, and slander that the Chinese people's opposition to the Soviet Communist Party revisionist leadership was "opposing the Soviet people," was "anti-Soviet," and repeatedly made unreasonable "protests" to the Chinese side.

Whenever Mayevsky and others looked for opportunities to provoke incidents, either on the spot or afterwards, the personnel of the China-Soviet Friendship Association who accompanied the delegation had repeatedly warned them to value the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, to seriously implement the agreements of the two countries' friendship associations, and to complete their visit to China smoothly, so that the delegation could leave a good impression among the Chinese people. After the delegation decided to interrupt their visit, relevant responsible personnel of the China-Soviet Friendship Association had repeatedly tried to persuade them. However, Mayevsky and others stubbornly refused to accept the warnings, continued to provoke incidents, acted arbitrarily, left the scene four times during their visit, refused to carry out four pre-agreed activities, made five unreasonable "protests" to the Chinese side, issued two threatening statements to announce the interruption of their visit, and finally unreasonably decided to leave China early, abruptly interrupting their visit, setting a very bad precedent in the history of exchanges between the friendship associations of the two countries.

Kang Jimin continued to expose that after the Soviet-China Friendship Association delegation returned to their country, the Soviet revisionist leadership further instructed Mayevsky to hold a press conference for Soviet and foreign journalists in Moscow, issuing malicious anti-China statements and speeches, spreading lies through Tass, major Soviet newspapers, and foreign journalists, claiming that the delegation had been subjected to "anti-Soviet provocations" in China, had been "attacked and insulted," and had been "forced" to interrupt their visit. They attempted to deceive the Soviet people and mislead the world's people, trying to shift the blame for their sabotage of the agreements between the friendship associations of the two countries and the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries onto the Chinese side.

At this press conference, Mayevsky and others fabricated a large number of lies and issued a series of extremely malicious anti-China provocations, directly targeting the great leader of all the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao. They completely ignored the boundless love and respect of 700 million Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world for the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and slandered the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works as "idol worship." They did not see the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the enthusiastic cheers of the revolutionary people of the world, and instead attacked the Chinese Cultural Revolution, claiming that it was "not a revolution" and was "far removed from the interests of workers and peasants," and that one of the results was "closing all schools." They also attempted to erase the brilliant achievements of China's socialist construction, claiming that Chinese workers and peasants had "many difficulties" and that the Chinese "working class had taken power only to maintain permanent poverty."

At this point, Kang Jimin emphasized that Mayevsky and others' actions during their visit to China and after their return fully demonstrated that the interruption of the visit by the Soviet-China Friendship Association delegation was completely a serious anti-China incident planned and organized by the Soviet revisionist leadership to further worsen Sino-Soviet relations, sabotage the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries. The evidence is irrefutable, and they cannot deny it.

Kang Jimin said that the Soviet Communist Party revisionist leadership, inheriting the legacy of Khrushchev, is implementing Khrushchevism without Khrushchev, and is going further and further down the road of colluding with the United States to oppose China. In order to launch a new wave of anti-China sentiment, to curry favor with American imperialism, and to realize their so-called dream of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world, they have degenerated to an extremely despicable and shameless level. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Beginning with the intention to harm others, ending with the result of harming oneself. This will be the development law of all reactionary policies." The Soviet revisionist leadership, which has done so much evil, will ultimately be overthrown by the Soviet people.

Kang Jimin finally said that under the education of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, the 700 million Chinese people have always regarded the Soviet people, nurtured by great Lenin, as their friends. The friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is eternal and cannot be destroyed by anyone. The temporary anti-China provocations of the Soviet revisionist leadership and their lackeys are like black spots in the sun and can never obscure the brilliant friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

    中苏友协理事揭露苏中友协代表团无理中断访华的真相
    苏修颠倒黑白大做反华文章极其卑鄙无耻
    苏修领导及其爪牙的反华叫嚣永远遮不住中苏人民伟大友谊的灿烂光辉
    新华社十五日讯　苏联修正主义领导集团在一手制造了苏中友好协会代表团无理中断访华的事件之后，近来又以此为题，开动宣传机器，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，把代表团中断访华的责任硬栽在中国头上，大作反华文章。在代表团访华期间曾经全程陪同代表团访问的中苏友好协会理事康冀民，为此向新华社记者发表谈话，揭露苏中友协代表团无理中断访华的事实真相，严正地驳斥了苏联方面的造谣诬蔑。
      中国方面始终给以热情友好接待
    康冀民说，以苏联《真理报》评论员马耶夫斯基为首的苏中友协代表团，是根据中苏两国友协今年的合作计划，应中苏友协的邀请，在十一月二日来我国参加中国人民庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十九周年活动并进行友好访问的。中苏友协和有关方面，遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的一贯教导，一如既往，从珍视和维护中苏两国人民的友谊出发，自始至终给予代表团以热情友好的接待，并且竭尽自己的力量，为代表团在我国的访问创造了最方便的条件。从十一月二日代表团到达中国之日起，到十七日代表团无理中断访问之日止，在短短十五天内，根据代表团的愿望和双方的协商，中国方面安排他们先后访问了北京、上海和广州三个城市。代表团在北京参加了庆祝伟大十月革命四十九周年晚会，在各地参观了四个工厂，两个农村人民公社，四个博物馆，两个大型工农业成就展览会，以及图书馆、工人文化宫和幼儿园等。根据代表团的要求，中国方面安排他们同大中学校的革命师生、红卫兵以及中国作家座谈，和中苏友协积极分子会见，同成千上万的我国工农群众和各方面人士进行了广泛接触。代表团所到之处，都受到了对伟大苏联人民怀有深厚感情的中国人民的热烈欢迎。当代表团第一次在天安门广场上出现时，一大群红卫兵热情地围住他们，争着和他们热烈握手，请他们向伟大的苏联人民转达亲切的问候。他们到北京郊区黄土岗人民公社参观时，社员们殷勤地邀请他们到家里去作客，有的团员同中国社员谈得很亲切，他们相互勉励“要好好教育后代，不能忘记过去”。代表团在上海访问时，代表团中的一位工人同中国工人谈得十分投机，久久不愿分开，后来马耶夫斯基把这位谈兴正浓的团员硬从中国工人面前拉走。这些铁的事实，想来马耶夫斯基仍然记忆犹新，而当代表团回到苏联之后，马耶夫斯基居然信口雌黄，任意歪曲事实，胡说什么代表团一到中国“就被置于非常困难的条件之下”，围绕着他们的“是一种敌对的气氛”，妄图以此来煽动苏联人民的反华情绪。
    马耶夫斯基等人一再进行公然挑衅
    接着，康冀民列举许多事实，揭露马耶夫斯基等人在访华期间曾多次主动挑起争端，甚至公然干涉中国内政，攻击我国无产阶级文化大革命和对外政策。
    当代表团在北京同大中学校红卫兵座谈有关中国文化大革命的问题时，马耶夫斯基等人曾向红卫兵们一连提出几十个问题，其中有许多问题显然是很不友好的。中国红卫兵虽然对马耶夫斯基等人的这种态度有所不满，但仍然以中苏两国人民的友谊为重，非常克制，心平气和地一一回答了他们的问题。但是，马耶夫斯基和个别团员却进一步进行挑衅，公然诬蔑中国文化大革命“破坏文化”，“与无产阶级革命毫无联系”。红卫兵们忍无可忍，不得不据理给以驳斥。这时，马耶夫斯基竟反咬一口，诬赖红卫兵“反苏”，示威性地带头退场，并且在事后向中苏友协有关人员极其无理地提出了所谓“抗议”。
    十一月七日晚，苏中友协代表团在苏联驻中国大使馆参加庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十九周年招待会。在招待会结束之后，北京一些高等学校的数百名革命师生和红卫兵，自动聚集到苏联大使馆门前的马路上，隆重地庆祝全世界无产阶级和革命人民的光辉节日。主持大会的红卫兵在会上说：“我们怀着对光荣的十月革命无限崇敬的心情，怀着对伟大的苏联人民无限热爱的心情，怀着对现代修正主义无比愤慨的心情，热烈庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十九周年。”在庆祝大会上，红卫兵们朗读了中共中央、人大常委会和国务院给苏共中央、苏联最高苏维埃主席团和苏联部长会议的贺电，不断高呼“伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁”“伟大的苏联人民万岁”“中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁”“打倒现代修正主义”等口号。庆祝大会上洋溢着红卫兵小将们的无限革命豪情，整个大会进行得既隆重热烈，又秩序井然。而马耶夫斯基竟然丝毫不顾事实，公开诬蔑中国红卫兵这天晚上在苏联大使馆门前“胡作非为”，进行了所谓的“反苏挑衅”。
    代表团由北京到上海访问之后，他们自己也承认上海的访问“令人满意”。但是，就在这种情况下，马耶夫斯基等人又节外生枝，毫无道理地执意取消预定第二天到长沙的访问日程，硬要临时改变路线去广州。而当中国方面作了很大努力，安排代表团到达广州以后，马耶夫斯基等人又在参观中进行挑衅。
    代表团在广州参观第二十届中国出口商品交易会的那天，交易会讲解人员在参观过程中告诉代表团，中国已经同全世界一百二十多个国家和地区建立了贸易往来，这一届交易会共接待来自六十多个国家和地区的客人六千多人，超过了以往任何一届，成交总额也创造了历届交易会的最高纪录。这种情况充分说明“我们的朋友遍天下”，以美国为首的帝国主义妄图封锁和孤立中国的政策已彻底破产。马耶夫斯基等人听了这些介绍以后，不仅不为中国对外贸易的成就感到高兴，相反地却当场公然诬蔑中国的对外贸易政策“不合乎马克思列宁主义原则”，胡说什么中国在平等互利基础上同世界各国开展的贸易往来“瓦解了世界革命人民的意志”。当马耶夫斯基等人这种恶毒攻击当场遭到严正驳斥以后，他们又一次示威性地中途退场，停止参观，并且在事后极其粗暴地向中国方面提出责难，毫无道理地单方面决定立即中断在中国的访问。
      不顾我方忠告片面决定中断访华
    在代表团访华期间，正是中国全体留学生被苏联政府无理勒令回国的时候。中国革命群众和红卫兵激于义愤，纷纷对苏联修正主义领导集团蓄意恶化中苏关系的罪行表示最强烈的抗议。在这种情况下，马耶夫斯基等人不仅不反躬自问，相反地却多次借口他们在街上听到有人喊“反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义”等口号，或者看到了“反帝必须反修”等标语，就公然颠倒黑白，混淆是非，诬蔑中国人民反对苏共修正主义领导集团就是“反对苏联人民”，就是
  “反苏”，从而一再无理地向中国方面提出所谓的“抗议”。
    在马耶夫斯基等人每次寻机挑衅的当场或事后，中苏友协陪同代表团参观的人员曾多次向他们提出忠告，希望他们以中苏两国人民友谊为重，认真执行两国友协的协议，顺利完成在中国的访问，以便代表团能够在中国人民中留下良好的印象。代表团提出中断访问以后，中苏友协有关负责人员曾多次挽留。但是，马耶夫斯基等人顽固地拒绝接受忠告，继续进行挑衅，一意孤行，访华期间先后四次在参观的中途退场，四次拒绝履行事先双方商定的活动项目，五次无理地向中国方面提出所谓“抗议”，两次发表宣布中断访华的威胁性声明，最后竟然毫无道理地单方面决定提前离开中国，悍然中断访问，在中苏两国友协人员的往来史上开创了极其恶劣的先例。
    康冀民继续揭露说，苏中友协代表团回国以后，苏联修正主义领导集团更进一步指使马耶夫斯基在莫斯科举行苏联和外国记者招待会，发表恶毒的反华声明和谈话，通过塔斯社、苏联各主要报纸和外国记者散布谎言，胡说什么代表团在中国遭到“反苏挑衅”，受到“攻击和谩骂”，以致“被迫”中断访问，借以欺骗苏联人民，蒙蔽世界人民的视听，企图把他们破坏中苏两国友协协议和两国人民传统友谊的罪责转嫁于中国方面。
      苏修反华罪责铁证如山
    在这次记者招待会上，马耶夫斯基等人还编造大量谎言，发出了一系列极其恶毒的反华叫嚣，把攻击的矛头直接指向全中国人民和全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席。他们完全无视七亿中国人民和全世界革命人民对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想的无限热爱和无限崇敬，竟然诬蔑中国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动是“拜神行为”。他们看不到中国无产阶级文化大革命的一片大好形势和全世界革命人民的热烈欢呼，竟然攻击中国文化大革命“不是革命”，“远远离开了”工农利益，其结果之一是“关闭所有学校”。他们还妄图抹杀中国社会主义建设的辉煌成就，胡说什么中国工农有“很多困难”，中国“工人阶级取得政权只是为了永远保持贫困”。
    谈到这里，康冀民强调指出，马耶夫斯基等人在访华期间以及他们回国以后的所作所为充分说明，苏中友协代表团的中断访华，完全是苏联修正主义领导集团为了进一步恶化中苏两国关系，破坏两国人民的传统友谊，从而预谋制造的一个有组织、有计划的严重反华事件。铁证如山，他们想抵赖是抵赖不了的。
    康冀民说，苏共修正主义领导集团继承赫鲁晓夫的衣钵，执行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫主义，在联美反华的道路上越走越远。他们为了掀起新的反华浪潮，献媚美帝国主义，实现其所谓苏美合作主宰世界的美梦，已经堕落到了极其卑鄙无耻的地步。我们的伟大领袖毛主席说过：“以损人的目的开始，以害己的结果告终。这将是一切反动政策的发展规律。”作尽了坏事的苏联修正主义领导集团，最后必将被苏联人民所打倒。
    康冀民最后说，在我们伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党教育下的七亿中国人民，始终不渝地把伟大列宁哺育下的苏联人民看作是自己的朋友。中苏两国人民的友谊是永恒的，是任何人也破坏不了的。苏联修正主义领导集团及其爪牙一时的反华叫嚣，就像太阳中的黑点一样，永远也遮不住中苏两国人民伟大友谊的灿烂光辉。
