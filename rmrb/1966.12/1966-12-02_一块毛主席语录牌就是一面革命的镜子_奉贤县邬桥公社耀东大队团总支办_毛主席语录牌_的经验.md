A Board of Chairman Mao's Quotations is a Revolutionary Mirror
— The Experience of the Youth League Branch of Yao Dong Production Brigade, Wuqiao People's Commune, Fengxian County in Setting Up Boards of Chairman Mao's Quotations

The Youth League Branch of Yao Dong Production Brigade, under the leadership of the Party Branch, has set up boards of Chairman Mao's quotations. The commune members generally feel that the quotations are concise, clear in meaning, easy to learn, easy to remember, and easy to apply. A board of quotations is indeed a revolutionary mirror.

In carrying out the campaign to "Learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun," the Youth League Branch of Yao Dong Production Brigade has made great efforts to set up boards of Chairman Mao's quotations, using them to promote the study and propagation of Mao Zedong Thought. The establishment of the quotation boards has promoted a new high tide of mass study and application of Chairman Mao's works, gradually changing the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of commune members, and powerfully advancing various tasks in the brigade.

Revolutionary Innovation and Mass Demand

The brigade Party Branch actively supports the revolutionary actions of the League members and youth, calling on them to learn from Comrade Liu Yingjun, persist in setting up boards of Chairman Mao's quotations, and enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought. The League members and youth set up quotation boards at the doors of commune members' homes, writing quotations relevant to various ideological issues and reading and explaining them to the commune members repeatedly. The commune members, moved, said: "The youth have brought us a guiding light." An elderly poor peasant in her sixties said: "Having Chairman Mao's words written at my door is like having Chairman Mao by my side, it's wonderful!" Under the urgent demand of the masses, this brigade has quotation boards in every household, revolutionary slogans everywhere, and everyone studies Chairman Mao's words.

Targeted and Integrated Study and Application

After setting up the quotation boards, the first problem encountered was what to write. Through gradual exploration and summation, some experiences were accumulated: the content should be "four-in-one," that is, it should be combined with the current situation, the central task, the ideological reality, and the production season. In this way, it is closely linked with the masses' thoughts and the central task.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the entire brigade uniformly selected Chairman Mao's quotations such as, "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons must be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely." These were written on the doors of commune members' homes and on mobile quotation boards; for different objects with different ideological situations, quotations such as, "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" were written indoors. Chairman Mao's quotations have raised the ideological awareness of the masses and inspired their revolutionary enthusiasm.

The Fourth Production Team had slow progress and poor quality in "rushing to harvest and plant" last year, falling behind. This year, the commune members initially lacked confidence in completing the "double rush" task in fifteen days. The quotation writers selected, "Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." and "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." These were written on the quotation boards, powerfully inspiring everyone to strive for progress and continuous struggle. In just ten days, they completed the "double rush" task in quality and quantity, making the fastest progress in the entire brigade.

Cadres Take the Lead and Achievements Are Obvious

To ensure the quotation boards are lively and effective, each production team has one to three quotation writers who are of good origin, high awareness, have a certain level of education, and lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The entire brigade has thirty-four quotation writers.

The main tasks of the quotation writers are: selecting quotations, writing quotations, reading quotations, explaining quotations, and guiding everyone to read, memorize, discuss, and apply the quotations. The quotation writers and League members must lead in "four aspects": leading in study, leading in application, leading in propaganda, and leading in defense. First, they themselves study and apply Chairman Mao's quotations, and at the same time help the commune members to do the same. The production committee member of the brigade Youth League, Gu Ronghua, who is a medical worker from a poor peasant background, made a quotation board. Whenever she went on medical rounds, she carried the medical bag on her right shoulder and the quotation board on her left shoulder. Wherever she went, the quotation board went with her. When a commune member was sick, she read the quotations and treated the illness. The commune members praised her, saying, "She is both a doctor and a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought."

In the campaign to "smash the four olds," the quotation writers selected, "The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them. All reactionary things, if you do not attack them, they will not fall. This is just like sweeping the floor, if the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." This inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. They said: "Old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits will not disappear by themselves. We must wield the revolutionary broom and sweep out all the poison of feudalism and capitalism, and the roots of revisionism, from every corner." The entire brigade organized a "smash the old, establish the new" propaganda team. The revolutionary young fighters were full of vigor, distributing portraits of Chairman Mao, propagating the Sixteen Points, and in just a few days, they swept away a large number of feudal superstitions and yellow books, to the great delight of the people.

Continuous Summation and Continuous Advancement

Setting up boards of Chairman Mao's quotations can widely propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the commune members, promoting the study and application of Chairman Mao's works; it can also mobilize the strength of young intellectuals, promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. To continue to vigorously promote the boards of Chairman Mao's quotations, they have summed up several experiences based on their initial practical experience:

First, setting up boards of Chairman Mao's quotations should be listed as an important method to promote the mass study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Select good quotation writers and actively set up and manage the quotation boards.

Second, insist on less but better. Each time, study only one or two quotations until the viewpoint is clear and the problem is solved, then study another one. Study one, apply one.

Third, write, read, explain, memorize, discuss, and act should be integrated.

Fourth, the quotations of Chairman Mao should be accurately excerpted and neatly written, so that people can see them clearly. (See picture)

Chairman Mao's words are all truths, each word shines with golden light, with the highest authority and the greatest power, and can solve problems the best. A soldier from a certain unit went deep into the masses, reading Chairman Mao's words word for word to the commune members.

    一块毛主席语录牌就是一面革命的镜子
    ——奉贤县邬桥公社耀东大队团总支办“毛主席语录牌”的经验
    奉贤县邬桥公社耀东大队团总支，在党支部的领导下，办起了毛主席语录牌。社员普遍反映：语录牌文字简短，意义明了，学起来方便，记起来方便，用起来方便，一块语录牌就是一面革命的镜子。
    耀东大队团总支在开展“向刘英俊同志学习”的活动中，全力办好毛主席语录牌，通过它推动学习和宣传毛泽东思想。毛主席语录牌的建立促进了群众性活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，逐步改变了广大社员的精神面貌，有力地推动了队里的各种工作。
  革命创举　群众要求
    大队党支部积极支持团员、青年的革命行动，号召他们向刘英俊同志学习，坚持办好毛主席语录牌，热情宣传毛泽东思想。团员和青年们在社员家门口设立毛主席语录牌，针对各种思想问题写上语录，给社员一遍一遍地读念和讲解。社员听了感动地说：“青年为我们送来了指路明灯”。一位六十多岁的贫农老妈妈说：“把毛主席的话写在我门口，就好像毛主席在我身边，真好！”在群众的迫切要求下，这个大队已经是语录牌户户有，革命标语处处见，毛主席的话人人学。
  有的放矢　学用结合
    语录牌办起后，首先碰到的问题是写什么。经过逐步摸索、总结，积累了一些经验：内容要“四结合”，即：结合当前形势，结合中心工作，结合思想实际，结合生产季节。这样就和群众思想，和中心工作有力地结合起来了。
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，全大队统一选录了毛主席的“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”等语录，写在社员家门口和流动语录牌上；又针对不同对象的不同思想情况，在室内写上“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”等语录。毛主席的语录，提高了群众的思想觉悟，鼓舞了群众的革命热情。
    第四生产队去年“抢收抢种”进度慢，质量差，落在后头。今年，社员起初对十五天完成“双抢”任务信心不足，语录员就选了“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”和“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”写在语录牌上，有力地鼓舞了大家奋发图强、连续作战的革命精神，仅仅十天工夫就按质按量完成了“双抢”任务，是全大队进度最快的。
  骨干带头　成效显著
    为了把语录牌办活办好，每一个生产队由一至三名出身好，觉悟高，有一定文化水平，带头活学活用毛主席著作的人担任语录员。全大队共有三十四个语录员。
    语录员的主要任务是：选语录、写语录、念语录、讲语录，引导大家看语录、背语录、议语录。语录员和团员在学习中要做到“四带头”，即：带头学，带头用，带头宣传，带头捍卫。首先自己活学活用毛主席语录，同时帮助社员活学活用。大队团总支生产委员顾荣华是贫下中农出身的卫生员，她做了一块语录牌，每逢巡回医疗，右肩背上卫生包，左肩背上语录牌，人到那里，语录牌带到那里。社员有病，她又读语录，又看病。社员称赞她“既是看病的医生，又是毛泽东思想的宣传员”。
    在破“四旧”活动中，语录员选了“人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”鼓舞群众的革命热情。他们说：“一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯是不会自行消灭的，我们就要挥起革命的铁扫帚，把封建主义、资本主义的一切流毒，把修正主义的孽根，从各个角落里统统扫出去。”全大队组织了“破旧立新宣传队”，革命小将斗志昂扬，送毛主席像，宣传十六条，在短短几天里，扫除了大量的封建迷信用品和黄色书籍，大快人心。
  不断总结　不断前进
    办毛主席语录牌，可以广泛地在社员群众中传播毛泽东思想，促进社员活学活用毛主席著作；可以发挥知识青年的力量，推动群众性的活学活用毛主席著作运动。为了继续大力推广毛主席语录牌，他们根据初步的实践经验，总结了几点体会：
    一、要把办毛主席语录牌列为推动群众性活学活用毛主席著作重要方法之一。推选好语录员，积极把语录牌办活办好。
    二、要坚持少而精，每次只学一两条语录，直到把观点弄清楚，问题解决了，再学另一条。学一条，用一条。
    三、要写、念、讲、记、议、做六结合。
    四、毛主席语录要摘录准确，书写工整，使人看得清楚。（附图片）
    毛主席的话，句句是真理，字字闪金光，威信最高，威力最大，最能解决问题。某部战士深入群众，把毛主席的话原原本本读给社员听。
