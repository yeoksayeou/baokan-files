Recently, we visited Red Guards who had walked from all corners of the country to Beijing. Their accounts of what they saw and heard along the Long March route made us deeply feel that, due to the widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought, the spiritual and social faces of hundreds of millions of peasants and vast rural areas are undergoing tremendous changes.

Hundreds of millions of peasants love to read Chairman Mao's books.
Everywhere is a red sea of Chairman Mao's quotations,
Everywhere resonates with the loud voices reading Chairman Mao's quotations,
Everywhere shines the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought!
This is the vivid summary by revolutionary youngsters from a Shanghai Long March team of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the vast rural areas along the route. It is also the common feeling of Long March youngsters from all over the country.

Currently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are actively responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high. Whether in the south or the north, whether in the plains or the mountains, the moving scenes of studying Chairman Mao's works everywhere, at all times, and by everyone, have left a deep impression on the Red Guard youngsters.

Chairman Mao's quotations written in bright red ink have decorated countless villages anew. On the walls, doors, tree trunks, and both sides of the roads, even in the sparsely populated mountains, there are eye-catching quotations from Chairman Mao shining brightly.

Chairman Mao's quotations and the "Three Articles" have become indispensable spiritual nourishment in the daily lives of the community members. Every morning, they carry the quotation boards to the fields. During labor, they insert the quotation boards into the ground or hang them on trees for easy study of Chairman Mao's teachings. During rest, people spontaneously gather together, take out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" they carry with them to read, or discuss production issues they encounter, heatedly.

Many communes' community members, no matter how tired they are after work, the first thing they do after dinner is to gather to study Chairman Mao's works. Some production teams often hold meetings to share experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, or gather community members to teach and sing songs written with Chairman Mao's quotations.

In the Yimeng Mountain area, some community members recite Chairman Mao's quotations while walking on the road.

In the Jianghuai Plain, some old carters read the "Three Articles" aloud with the passengers while driving.

On the Haihe Water Conservancy Project, red flags are flying, and the workers are full of enthusiasm. The person leading the rammer leads everyone, shouting slogans compiled from Chairman Mao's quotations.

In many regions, the Young Pioneers set up propaganda stations or quotation posts at the village entrance or roadside. They not only enthusiastically propagate to passersby but also play a supervisory role in studying. Seeing someone coming, they ask him to recite a few quotations from Chairman Mao or sing a song written with Chairman Mao's quotations. If someone recites poorly or doesn't know how to sing, they will patiently teach him like a little teacher.

The female Red Guards on the Long March often sleep on the same kang (bed) with many poor peasant grandmothers along the way, reading the "Three Articles" with them. Some poor peasant grandmothers wake up the Red Guards sleeping beside them in the middle of the night, asking them to repeat the name of the Canadian doctor who was selfless and dedicated, so that they can forever engrave the name of the shining Norman Bethune in their hearts.

In some remote mountain villages, the Long March youngsters often see many poor and lower-middle peasants reciting a quotation from Chairman Mao before meals and singing a song written with Chairman Mao's quotations, and then eating. They are turning their families into red revolutionary families under the slogan of "Old leading the young, young urging the old, the whole family red."

Many communes and production brigades set up reception stations along the Long March route for the revolutionary youngsters. In the reception stations, the poor and lower-middle peasants not only enthusiastically arrange food and accommodation for the Red Guards who have come from afar but also read Chairman Mao's quotations and sing revolutionary songs with the youngsters, performing various artistic performances praising the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, turning the reception stations into propaganda stations for Mao Zedong Thought.

The Long March youngsters originally came to the countryside with full enthusiasm to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. However, they felt on the Long March that many poor and lower-middle peasant community members study and apply Chairman Mao's works better than themselves. They should learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Long March youngsters from various places excitedly said that Comrade Lin Biao called for using Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts of the people of the whole country. Now this great call is being turned into the actual actions of hundreds of millions of peasants. Our great motherland's countryside is gradually becoming a big school of Mao Zedong Thought!

Mao Zedong Thought is cultivating a new generation of peasants.
Whether in the mountains or the plains, the Long March youngsters strongly felt that Mao Zedong Thought is washing away the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left over from the old society, changing the spiritual faces of hundreds of millions of peasants.

Recently, a Long March team that walked from Nanjing through Julu Village in Shandong's Juxian County saw that the people of Julu Village had achieved great results in using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls. The youngsters said that the community members here are ashamed of private interests and proud of public interests, love the collective, and care about the country's advanced deeds, which are countless. In the past, some people who were called "old conservatives" are now competing to be "new Yu Gong." Those who used to only think about earning work points now wholeheartedly farm for the revolution. The activities of becoming red community members, red families, and red descendants are booming here.

In Julu Village, there is a woman named Dai Chunying. She used to be not very active in collective labor. After studying Chairman Mao's works, this woman who had suffered a lot in the old society understood that she should "serve the people wholeheartedly" and be like Comrade Norman Bethune, extremely responsible for work and extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people. Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated her heart. In the past, she sometimes carried a basket to cut the community's firewood for her own use. Now, she carries a basket to work in the fields but hands over the manure she picks up along the way to the production team. This summer, when most of the labor force went to build a reservoir, the task of harvesting wheat and planting sweet potatoes was very arduous. Dai Chunying, lying on the kang at night, had surging emotions, thinking of Chairman Mao's work "Moving Mountains," and associating it with harvesting wheat and planting sweet potatoes as "two mountains" that must be moved. She got up from the kang in the middle of the night and called the women community members at home to go to the fields to harvest wheat. Later, when the team called for accumulating fertilizer, she also dismantled the earth wall of her old house to make fertilizer. When the Long March team youngsters asked her, she said: "Didn't Chairman Mao teach us to serve the people wholeheartedly? As long as it is beneficial to the people, I am willing to do it!"

A Long March team from Heilongjiang Province, passing through Lingyuan County's Qitian Commune in Liaoning Province, once visited a five-good militia named Sun Wu. Once, this young man and a few community members were planting trees on a hillside. Suddenly, a large rock rolled down from the terrace construction site on the mountain. The large rock rolled down the slope straight towards the community members working below. At this moment, Sun Wu's mind flashed with the image of Comrade Wang Jie sacrificing himself to save the militia. He took a step forward and, with all his strength, hugged the large rock, saving the safety of the community members below. But he was injured himself. Not long ago, when the Long March youngsters asked him to introduce his advanced deeds, this young man shyly said: Compared to Comrade Wang Jie, I am far behind! I still need to continue studying the "Three Articles" well.

The similar new people and new deeds talked about by the Long March teams from various places are countless. They said that from these new-type peasants, we deeply feel that after liberation, agricultural collectivization, and people's communes, especially in recent years with the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the peasants' spiritual faces have undergone extremely profound changes. Hundreds of millions of peasants have found powerful ideological weapons to eliminate private interests and establish public interests from the brilliant works of Chairman Mao and are using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls.

They said, the great Mao Zedong Thought is cultivating a new generation of peasants in our country. We Red Guards must learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, study and apply the "Three Articles," and stride forward towards the world of communism with a spirit of selflessness!

Mao Zedong Thought turns into a great material force.
Chairman Mao said: "People's social existence determines people's thoughts. And the correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will turn into material forces to transform society and the world."

The youngsters who walked and connected saw with their own eyes the countless moving scenes of the broad masses of community members changing the sky and earth and fighting against nature, fully proving the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's above-mentioned statement.

A Long March team talked about what they saw with their own eyes in a Dazhai-style advanced unit in Hebei Province. This production brigade was originally a poor mountain gorge with only rocks and no soil. After learning "Moving Mountains," the community members vowed to cut down the mountain head and fill the mountain gorge. However, after a few days of work, many picks and iron drills were broken, but not much of the mountain head was cut down. Some people began to waver. They studied "Moving Mountains" again and decided to eliminate the "fear" character and farm for the revolution like Old Yu Gong. Thus, they overcame various difficulties and continued to work. Tools were broken, and they repaired them themselves. Some young people swung a large hammer, hitting more than a hundred times, and still didn't let others replace them. After two months of hard work, they finally cut down the mountain head and built a flat and level piece of land.

A group of revolutionary teachers and students passed through a commune in the northern part of Henan Province, where community members and cadres were discussing how much public grain and surplus grain to deliver to the state. According to regulations, they should deliver 200,000 jin, but everyone insisted on delivering 300,000 jin. They said: The commune's grain production this year is 50% higher than last year, which is the result of listening to Chairman Mao's words. It is appropriate to deliver more to express the poor and lower-middle peasants' gratitude to Chairman Mao! Originally, this commune was low-lying, with saline-alkali soil, and often suffered from drought and flood disasters, making the yield unstable. This year, they studied Chairman Mao's works, swept away the "pessimistic view," carefully studied the natural conditions and disaster laws, vigorously developed water conservancy, and built terraced fields, enclosed fields, strip fields, and square fields. In a year of continuous drought without rain, they achieved an unprecedented good harvest, with the total grain production increased by 50% compared to last year.

The youngsters who walked and connected saw along the way the moving deeds of the peasant masses fighting against nature, strongly feeling that: Currently, our country's countryside is gradually forming a new all-around leap-forward situation, and the broad masses of community members have never been as spirited, enthusiastic, and full of vigor as they are now. Whether inside or outside the Great Wall, south of the Yangtze River, or in the mountains and plains, they saw community members working selflessly to strive for an even greater harvest next year.

All of this made the revolutionary youngsters who walked and connected realize that hundreds of millions of peasants, with Mao Zedong Thought as the compass, are determined to turn the sky of the countryside into the sky of Mao Zedong Thought and the land of the countryside into the land of Mao Zedong Thought, making themselves people armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

### 毛泽东思想光辉照亮了亿万农民的心——长征红卫兵喜看农村新面貌

    毛泽东思想光辉照亮了亿万农民的心
    ——长征红卫兵喜看农村新面貌
    最近，我们访问了从祖国四面八方步行来北京的红卫兵小将，他们所谈的在长征路上的所见所闻，使我们深深感觉到，由于毛泽东思想的大普及，亿万农民的精神面貌和广大农村的社会面貌正在发生着巨大的变化。
    亿万农民爱读毛主席的书
    到处是毛主席语录的红色海洋，
    到处荡漾着朗读毛主席语录的响亮声音，
    到处闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉！
    这是上海一支赴京长征队的革命小将们，对沿途广大农村活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动的生动概括。也是来自全国各地的长征小将们的共同感受。
    目前，广大贫下中农积极响应林彪同志的号召，正把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的高潮。不论是南方，是北方，也不论是平原，是山区，那种无处不学、无时不学、无人不学毛主席著作的动人场景，给红卫兵小将们留下了极为深刻的印象。
    用鲜红颜料写成的毛主席语录，把无数村庄装饰一新。墙壁上，大门上，树干上，道路两旁，甚至在人烟稀少的崇山峻岭中间，都有醒目的毛主席语录在那里闪闪发光。
    毛主席语录和“老三篇”，已经成了社员们每天生活中必不可少的精神食粮。每天早晨，他们扛着毛主席语录牌走向田间。劳动时，他们把语录牌插在地头或挂在树上，以便随时学习毛主席的教导。休息时，人们自动围拢在一起，拿出随身携带的《毛主席语录》阅读起来，或者带着生产中遇到的问题，进行热烈讨论。
    许多公社的社员劳动归来，不管有多么疲乏，晚饭后的第一件事，就是集合起来学习毛主席著作。有的生产队经常召开活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，或是把社员聚集一处，教唱用毛主席语录谱写的歌。
    在沂蒙山区，一些社员在路上一边走，一边背诵着毛主席语录。
    在江淮平原，有的老车工在赶车时，和坐车的人轮流朗读“老三篇”。
    在海河水利工地上，红旗招展，民工们干劲冲天。领夯的人领着大家，呼喊着用毛主席语录编的号子。
    许多地区的村寨，少先队员们在村头或路边自动设立了宣传站、语录岗。他们不但热情地向过往行人进行宣传，而且也起着督促学习的作用。看见有人走来，就请他背上几段毛主席语录，或者唱一支用毛主席语录谱写的歌。假如有个别人背得不熟或者不会唱，他们就会像小先生一样，耐心地教给他。
      长征的女红卫兵们常和沿途的许多贫农老大妈睡在一个炕上，和她们一起朗读“老三篇”。有的贫农老大娘深夜叫醒睡在身边的红卫兵，让她把那位毫不利己专门利人的加拿大医生的名字再说一遍，以便把白求恩这个光辉的名字永远铭刻在心上。
    在一些偏僻的山村里，长征小将们常常看到许多贫下中农社员家在吃饭前，每人都要背一条毛主席语录，再合唱一支用毛主席语录谱写的歌，然后再吃饭。他们正在“老带小，小促老，全家红”的口号下，把自己家变成红色的革命家庭。
    许多地区的公社和大队，在革命小将们的长征沿途设立了接待站。在接待站里，贫下中农不仅热情地为远道而来的红卫兵安排食宿，而且和小将们一起朗读毛主席语录，大唱革命歌曲，表演各种歌颂伟大领袖毛主席、歌颂毛泽东思想的文艺节目，把接待站办成了毛泽东思想的宣传站。
    长征小将们本是怀着满腔热情到农村宣传毛泽东思想的。但是，他们在长征途中感到，许多贫下中农社员活学活用毛主席著作，比自己学得好，用得好，自己应当向贫下中农学习。
    来自各地的长征小将们兴奋地说，林彪同志号召要用毛泽东思想来统一全国人民的思想。现在这一伟大号召正在变成亿万农民的实际行动，我们伟大祖国的农村正在逐步成为毛泽东思想的大学校！
      毛泽东思想造就着一代新型农民
    不论在山区，在平原，长征小将们都强烈地感受到毛泽东思想正在荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，改变着亿万农民的精神面貌。
    最近从南京步行经过山东莒南县厉家寨的一支长征队，看到厉家寨人在用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂方面已经取得了很大成绩。小将们说，这里的社员们以私为耻，以公为荣，热爱集体，关心国家的先进事迹，是说不完的。过去一些被人称为“老保守”的人在争当“新愚公”，过去只想挣工分的人，现在一心一意为革命而种田。争做红社员、红家庭、红后代的活动在这里搞得热火朝天。
    厉家寨有个妇女叫戴春英，以前不大积极参加集体劳动。自从学习毛主席著作以后，这个旧社会饱尝辛酸的女社员，懂得了要“全心全意地为人民服务”，应该像白求恩同志那样对工作极端的负责任，对同志对人民极端的热忱。毛主席的教导照亮了她的心。过去，她有时提着篮子出去割队里的柴给自己用。现在，她下地干活也带着篮子，却把沿路拾的粪交给生产队。今年夏天，队里大部分劳力修水库去了，当时，收小麦和栽甘薯的任务很艰巨。戴春英夜里睡在炕上，心潮澎湃，想着毛主席的著作《愚公移山》，联想到收小麦、栽甘薯也是“两座山”，一定要把它们搬掉。她半夜就下了炕，召集队里在家的女社员一起下地割麦。后来，队里号召积肥，她又把自己老屋的土墙拆掉做肥料。当长征队小将们问起她的时候，她说：“毛主席不是教导我们要全心全意地为人民服务吗？只要是对人民有益的事，我都心甘情愿去做！”
    黑龙江省的一支长征队小将路过辽宁省凌源县欺天公社时，曾经访问过一个名叫孙武的五好民兵。有一次这个小伙子和几个社员在山腰栽树，突然间，一块大石头从山上修梯田的地方翻滚下来。大石头顺着山坡直往下滚，眼看就要砸着山下干活的社员。这时，孙武的脑海里闪现出王杰同志舍身救民兵的英雄形象，就一个箭步冲上去，用尽平生气力把大石头猛然抱住，保住了山下社员的安全。但他自己却受了伤。不久前，当长征小将们请他介绍先进事迹时，这个小伙子却腼腆地说：比起王杰同志来，我差得远哩！我还要继续好好学习“老三篇”。
    来自各地的长征队小将们谈到的类似戴春英、孙武这样的新人新事，是很多很多的。他们说，从这些新型农民身上，使我们深深感到，解放后，农业集体化、人民公社化以后，特别是近年来活学活用毛主席著作群众运动展开以后，农民的思想面貌发生了极其深刻的变化。亿万农民从光辉的毛主席著作中找到了破私立公的强大的思想武器，正在用毛泽东思想改造着自己的灵魂。
    他们说，伟大的毛泽东思想造就着我国一代新型农民。我们红卫兵一定要向工农兵学习，活学活用“老三篇”，向一心为公的共产主义精神世界阔步前进！
      毛泽东思想变成巨大的物质力量
    毛主席说：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”
    步行串连的小将们亲眼看到的广大社员改天换地、向大自然开战的无数动人场景，充分证明了毛主席上述论断的无比正确。
    一支长征队谈到他们路过河北省亲眼见到的一个大寨式先进单位劈山开地的情景。这个大队原是光有石头没有土的穷山沟。社员们学习了《愚公移山》后，发誓要劈下山头填平山涧。可是，没干几天，尖镐、铁钎坏了不少，山头却没有削下很多。有的人有点动摇了。他们就又学习《愚公移山》，决心像老愚公那样，要革掉“怕”字，要为革命而种田。于是他们克服各种困难，继续干下去。工具坏了，自己动手修。有的青年抡起大铁锤，一连打了一百多下，还不肯让别人替换。经过两个月的奋战，他们终于劈下了山头，修起了一块平平整整的山地。
    一批革命师生路过豫北地区一个公社时，社员和干部们正在讨论向国家交售多少公粮和余粮的问题。按规定应交售二十万斤，但大家坚持要交售三十万斤。他们说：社里今年粮食比去年多收了五成，这是听了毛主席的话的结果。理应多交一些，向毛主席表表贫下中农的一点心意！原来，这个公社地势低洼，土地盐碱化，又经常遭受旱、涝灾害，使收成不稳定。今年，他们学习了毛主席著作，扫掉了“悲观论”，他们仔细地研究了自然条件和成灾规律，大兴水利，大搞台田、围田、条田、方田，竟在连续一年多没下透雨的大旱之年，夺得了从没有过的好收成，粮食总产量比去年增加了五成。
    步行串连的小将们，沿途见到农民群众与天斗、与地斗的动人事迹，强烈地感受到：当前我国农村正在逐步形成新的全面跃进局面，广大社员从来也没有像现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。无论是长城内外，大江南北，还是山区、平原，他们都见到社员们正为夺取明年更大丰收而忘我劳动。
    这一切的一切，使步行串连的革命小将们意识到，亿万农民正以毛泽东思想为指针，决心要把农村的天变成毛泽东思想的天，把农村的地变成毛泽东思想的地，使自己成为毛泽东思想武装起来的人！
