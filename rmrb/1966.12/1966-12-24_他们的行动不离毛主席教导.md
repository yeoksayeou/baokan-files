Their actions never depart from Chairman Mao's teachings. In Longtian Commune's Er Village Brigade of Fuzhou County, Fujian Province, there are 516 households, and every family has a portrait of Chairman Mao and reads Chairman Mao's works. The village is filled with quotations from Chairman Mao, and revolutionary songs and the recitation of quotations can be heard everywhere. The commune members study whenever they have a spare moment, whether in the fields, at meetings, or at home. Some couples discuss Chairman Mao's teachings passionately to understand his ideas better. When commune members meet, they often ask each other, "How many quotations have you learned today?" Now, the entire brigade has many people who can recite more than 20 quotations. Many people carry Chairman Mao's works with them, speak Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

Chairman Mao's quotations have become the brigade members' guiding principles. Everyone firmly remembers the fundamental ideas in the "Three Articles" and uses them as revolutionary "iron brooms" to sweep away the trash in the depths of their souls at all times. Commune member Zhang Houlien has often thought in recent years: "I have no children or grandchildren, so why should I work hard?" As soon as selfish thoughts arise, his hands slacken, and he cares less about the collective. After studying the "Three Articles," he decided to follow Chairman Mao's words and think for all the people of China and the world. One night, he woke up to find it raining heavily outside. He thought about how the production team had piled soil on the road while building a house, making it easy for people to slip after the rain. So, he put on a raincoat, took a hoe, and braved the rain to remove the soil. He said, "After studying the 'Three Articles,' I understand 'farming for the revolution' and 'serving the people.'"

Female commune member Wang Hanying used to be selfish. Every time she tilled her private plot, she would move the boundary a bit further with her hoe. As a result, the plot kept getting bigger. When other commune members criticized her, she would argue with them. After studying Chairman Mao's works, she realized her mistake, broadened her perspective, and stopped doing this. This year, when the production team needed to grow potato seedlings, because her private plot was most suitable for growing seedlings, she voluntarily went to the cadres and offered to lend her plot to the team for use. She said, "Chairman Mao teaches me to be selfless and devoted to others. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions. When the team has a bumper harvest, it can support socialist construction, and that is the big thing."

    他们的行动不离毛主席教导
    福建省福清县龙田公社二村大队，共有五百一十六户人家，家家贴毛主席像，读毛主席书。村里写满了毛主席语录，到处可以听到革命歌声和背诵语录声。社员们在田边、会场、家里，抓空就学习。有的夫妻为了领会毛主席的一个观点，互相热烈讨论；社员们见面经常询问的是：今天又学了几条语录？现在，全队已有不少人能背诵二十条以上语录。许多人身不离毛主席书，口不离毛主席话，行动不离毛主席教导。
    毛主席语录成了大队社员的座右铭。大家牢牢记住“老三篇”中的基本观点，把它们当做革命的“铁扫帚”，时时刻刻横扫灵魂深处的垃圾。社员张后连，近年来常想：自己没子没孙的，积极劳动为了什么呢？私心一抬头，手头就松劲，对集体就关心得少了。学了“老三篇”以后，他决心听毛主席的话，为全中国和全世界人民着想。一天，半夜醒来，外面下大雨，他想到生产队盖房时把泥土堆在路上，雨后行人容易跌倒，就披起棕衣，拿起锄头，冒着大雨把土扒掉。他说：学了“老三篇”，我懂得了“为革命种田”，“为人民服务”。
    女社员王汉英过去私心重，每次整自留地，总是往外挪一锄。结果，那块地越滚越大。社员批评她，她就和人家吵嘴。学习毛主席著作以后，她认识到自己的错误，眼光放远了，不再这样做了。今年生产队要育薯苗，因为她的自留地最适宜育秧，她就主动去找干部，要把自留地借给队里用，并且说：“毛主席教我要毫不利己专门利人，我一定照毛主席的指示做。队里粮食丰收了，支援社会主义建设，这才是大事哩。”
