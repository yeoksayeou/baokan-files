What are proteins? What is insulin? What is the significance of artificially synthesizing insulin, a type of protein? This discussion begins with organic compounds.

In the past, people believed that a certain class of compounds could only be obtained from living organisms and could not be synthesized artificially. Since living organisms are organic, these compounds were called organic compounds. Because it was believed that organic compounds could only be obtained from living organisms, idealists asserted that there was an insurmountable absolute boundary between organic and inorganic compounds. They claimed that organic compounds, living matter, and living organisms were all created by a non-existent God. Materialists, on the other hand, held the opposite view. Materialists believe that organic compounds are derived from inorganic compounds, and living matter is derived from non-living matter, all of which are the result of the objective material world's movement from simple to complex.

In 1828, a German scientist named Friedrich Wöhler artificially synthesized an organic compound, urea, from inorganic substances using chemical methods for the first time in the world. This broke the supposed absolute boundary between organic and inorganic compounds, demonstrating that inorganic compounds can be synthesized into organic compounds, and that organic compounds are derived from inorganic compounds. This was a heavy blow to idealism. The great revolutionary leader Engels gave this achievement a very high evaluation. The biological and chemical sciences of the 19th century also underwent a revolution as a result.

With the development of science, people discovered that among organic compounds, there are two types of substances that are the material basis of life: one is nucleic acid, and the other is protein. Nucleic acid is a very complex organic compound that was first discovered in the cell nucleus, hence the name. There are now two major types of nucleic acids discovered: deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid. Many scientists believe that the former is the material basis for reproduction in organisms, while the latter is widely present in the cytoplasm and plays an important role in the synthesis of proteins within the organism.

The types of proteins in living organisms are diverse, and even within a single cell, there can be thousands of types. In all life activities, proteins participate and play a major role. For example, enzymes are a large class of proteins, and almost all chemical reactions in the human body are catalyzed by them. For instance, when food is digested in the intestines and stomach and absorbed by the body, converting into energy, various types of enzymes are at work. Some hormones (not all hormones) are also proteins, and they regulate and control metabolism within the organism. For example, humans and animals can move and their muscles can contract freely, all due to a type of contractile muscle protein.

In the pancreas of humans and animals, there are some islet-shaped cells that secrete a hormone protein, which regulates blood sugar metabolism in the human and animal body. A lack of this hormone causes sugar utilization to be impaired, leading to elevated blood sugar levels and diabetes. If there is too much of this hormone, blood sugar levels can drop too low, causing convulsions and even death. This hormone is insulin.

Proteins are all composed of amino acids. Amino acids are a class of organic compounds containing amino groups. There are now more than forty known amino acids, of which twenty-three are involved in the composition of proteins. If amino acids are compared to phonetic letters, proteins are like words composed of these letters. Just as twenty-six Latin letters can form tens of thousands of words and create a rich language, twenty-plus amino acids, through different numbers and types of arrangements and combinations, can form countless proteins. There are already thousands of proteins discovered.

In chemistry, the product of connecting one amino acid to another through chemical reactions is called a peptide. A peptide containing two amino acids is called a dipeptide, one containing three is called a tripeptide, and one containing multiple amino acids is called a polypeptide. Proteins are all composed of polypeptides. Scientists have discovered through research that the polypeptide chains that make up proteins not only have a definite sequence of amino acids, but they also coil, fold, and aggregate to form so-called secondary, tertiary, and quaternary special spatial structures. Scientists believe that this special spatial structure of proteins is the fundamental difference between proteins and polypeptide substances and is the basis for their physiological functions.

Insulin, this type of protein, is composed of a 21-peptide A chain and a 30-peptide B chain, connected by two sulfur atoms (also called two disulfide bonds), and at the same time coiled and folded to form secondary and tertiary structures. The insulin of humans, cows, and sheep is only different in a few amino acids on the two chains, with no qualitative differences.

Due to the complexity of protein structure, although many countries have studied proteins, for a long time, no scientist dared to propose the artificial synthesis of insulin. In 1958, Chinese scientists, under the call of Chairman Mao to break away from superstition and liberate thought, began the first research on the artificial synthesis of insulin. Following this, West Germany and the United States also started research. After more than six years of effort, Chinese scientists were the first in the world to obtain crystalline artificial insulin.

Proteins are one of the material bases of life. The artificial synthesis of insulin has enabled humanity to take a great step forward in the great journey of exploring the mysteries of life, marking the beginning of the era of synthetic proteins. This research once again convincingly proves the brilliant philosophical ideas of Marxism on the origin of life, and also proves the absurdity of idealism. At the same time, this achievement lays a good foundation for China's future research on protein and polypeptide drugs.

### 谈谈蛋白质、胰岛素

    谈谈蛋白质、胰岛素
    什么是蛋白质？什么是胰岛素？用人工方法合成胰岛素这一种蛋白质有什么重大的意义？这要从有机化合物谈起。
    从前人们以为有一类化合物只能从生物体得到，人工是无法合成的。生物体是有机的，所以就把这类化合物叫作有机化合物。正因为以为有机物只能从生物体得到，所以唯心主义者断言：有机物和无机物之间存在着不可逾越的绝对界限。他们认为，有机物、有生命的物质、生物体，都是由客观世界根本不存在的上帝创造的。唯物主义者和唯心主义者的断言正相反。唯物主义者认为：有机物是由无机物发展而来，有生命的物质是由无生命的物质发展而来，这都是客观物质由简单到复杂运动的结果。
    一八二八年，德国一个叫违勒的科学家，在世界上第一次把无机物用化学的方法，人工合成了一种有机化合物——尿素，从而打破了有机物和无机物之间的所谓绝对界限，说明无机物可以合成有机物，有机物是从无机物而来。这是对唯心主义的一次沉重打击。伟大的革命导师恩格斯曾经给予这一成就极高的评价。十九世纪的生物学、化学等自然科学也因此爆发了一场革命。
    随着科学的发展，人们发现，在有机化合物中，有两类物质是生命的物质基础：一是核酸，一是蛋白质。核酸是一种很复杂的有机化合物，最早是在细胞核中发现的，所以取名叫核酸。现在已经发现的核酸有去氧核糖核酸和核糖核酸两大类。许多科学家认为，前一类是生物体内传种接代的物质基础，后一类广泛存在于细胞质中，它在生物体内对蛋白质合成有重要作用。
    生物体中蛋白质的种类是多种多样的，即使在一个细胞中也有上千种。在一切生命活动中，都有蛋白质参与，起主要作用。例如酶就是一大类蛋白质，一切人体内化学反应，几乎都是由它催化的。像食物经过肠胃消化，被人体吸收，转化为能量，都有各种各样的酶在起作用。有些激素（不是所有激素）也是蛋白质，它们在生物体内起调节、控制新陈代谢的作用。又如人和动物所以能够运动，肌肉伸缩自如，也是靠一种能够伸缩的肌肉蛋白质来完成的。
    在人和动物的胰脏中，有一种呈岛形的细胞，这种细胞分泌一种激素蛋白质，在人和动物体内起调节血糖代谢的生理功能。缺少这种激素，糖的利用发生障碍，血糖就会升高，就会得糖尿病。如果这种激素过多了，血糖过分低，就会引起抽搐以至死亡。这种激素就是胰岛素。
    蛋白质都是由氨基酸组成的。氨基酸是一类含有氨基的有机化合物。现在已经发现的氨基酸共有四十多种，其中参与组成蛋白质的氨基酸有二十三种。如果把氨基酸比作拼音字母，蛋白质就好比是由字母构成的字词，正像二十六个拉丁字母，可以构成数以万计的单词，组成无比丰富的语言一样，二十多种氨基酸通过不同数目、不同种类的排列组合，可以形成无数种蛋白质。目前已经发现的蛋白质有几千种。
    在化学上，通过化学反应，把一个一个氨基酸连接起来的产物，叫做肽。含两个氨基酸的叫二肽，含三个的叫三肽，含多个的叫多肽。蛋白质都是由多肽构成的。科学家经过研究发现，构成蛋白质的多肽肽链，不仅氨基酸排列有一定次序，它还盘曲、折叠、聚合起来，形成所谓二级、三级、四级特殊的空间结构。科学家们认为，蛋白质所具有的这种特殊空间结构，就是它和多肽物质的根本区别，也是它具有生理功能的基础。
    胰岛素这一种蛋白质是由一条二十一肽的A链，一条三十肽的B链，通过两对硫原子（也叫两个硫硫键）联结起来，同时盘曲、折叠，形成二、三级结构。人、牛、羊不同的胰岛素只是两条链上个别氨基酸不同而没有质的差别。
    由于蛋白质结构的这一复杂性，虽然世界各国研究蛋白质的很多，但很长时期内没有哪一国的科学家敢于提出人工合成胰岛素。一九五八年，我国科学工作者在毛主席的破除迷信，解放思想的号召鼓舞下，首先开始研究胰岛素的人工合成。接着，西德、美国才跟着进行研究。经过六年多的努力，我国科学工作者在世界上第一个得到人工合成胰岛素的结晶。
    蛋白质是生命的物质基础之一。人工合成出胰岛素，这使得人类在探索生命奥秘的伟大历程中又迈进了一大步，标志着合成蛋白质的时代开始了。这项研究再次雄辩地证明了马克思主义关于生命起源的唯物辩证学说的光辉哲学思想，也证明了唯心主义的荒谬可笑。同时，这项成就为我国今后从事蛋白质和多肽药物的研究，奠定了良好的基础。
