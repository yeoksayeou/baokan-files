The Vietnamese people in the South, through their indomitable struggle, have achieved an unprecedentedly favorable situation in 1966. The U.S. imperialists have thrown more than a quarter of their army and a large number of naval and air forces into the South Vietnamese battlefield, yet they have failed to reverse the situation. The heroic Vietnamese people in the South have mobilized the power of people's war, driving the U.S. imperialists into a state of utter confusion, exhaustion, and utter disarray, laying a solid foundation for greater victories in the future.

The noose around the neck of U.S. imperialism is tightening

Chairman Mao said: "The hands of U.S. imperialism have stretched too far. Every place it invades, it puts a new noose around its own neck." The U.S. imperialists' invasion of Vietnam has put a big noose around their own necks, handing the other end to the Vietnamese people and the people of the world. The more they expand their war of aggression and struggle, the tighter the noose becomes.

1966 was a year of fierce counterattacks by U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people, but it was also a year of their crushing defeat in the Vietnam War. In this year, they used their counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy alternately. On the one hand, they sent a large number of troops to South Vietnam, increasing their invading forces by more than onefold, leading the charge in bloody "sweeps"; they carried out even more barbaric bombing of North Vietnam, escalating the war of aggression. On the other hand, they colluded with the Soviet revisionist clique, repeatedly playing the "peace talks" trick, attempting to use the smoke screen of "peace talks" to cover up their crimes of expanding the war, and also attempting to use the threat of expanding the war to force a "peace talks" situation, to grab on the negotiating table what they could not grab on the battlefield.

However, the heroic Vietnamese people are not intimidated and are not deceived. They do not harbor any illusions about the "wisdom" of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, do not believe in the "good words" of U.S. imperialism, and are not afraid of its threats. They have smashed the war blackmail of U.S. imperialism and the sinister plots of U.S.-Soviet collusion with "war to force peace," "bombing to force peace," and "stopping bombing to lure peace" through resolute fighting actions.

In the face of the large-scale U.S. troop buildup, they further developed the people's guerrilla war, setting up a dense net of traps for the American aggressors. The main forces of the liberation armed forces, local forces, and militia guerrillas worked closely together, using extremely flexible and mobile tactics to actively attack the enemy on a vast battlefield, annihilating a large number of the enemy's fighting forces. From January to the end of November this year, the South Vietnamese people killed, wounded, and captured a total of 233,000 enemy troops, including 100,700 U.S. aggressors; they shot down and destroyed nearly 1,900 enemy aircraft. This means that in the eleven months of this year, the number of U.S. troops annihilated is approximately half more than the number of U.S. troops sent to Vietnam in the same period this year (181,000) and more than five times the total number of U.S. troops annihilated last year (19,200).

The strategic plans of the White House and the Pentagon have failed

Nineteen years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out that when the U.S. imperialists directed their lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, to launch a large-scale invasion of the Chinese liberated areas, "they overestimated their own strength and underestimated the strength of the revolution, recklessly launching a war, and thus fell into the trap they had set for themselves. Our enemy's strategic plan has been thoroughly defeated." Today, the situation of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in South Vietnam is exactly the same.

The U.S. imperialists, who hold nuclear weapons in their hands, foolishly think they are "exceptionally powerful" and "invincible in the world." They think that as soon as their "elite troops" are sent to the South Vietnamese battlefield, they can "regain the initiative" and "quickly pacify South Vietnam," realizing their dream of permanently occupying South Vietnam. However, the situation over the past year has shown that they have fallen into the trap they set for themselves, and their strategic plan has been thoroughly foiled.

The U.S. imperialists originally wanted to use a large army to achieve a quick victory. However, the opposite happened. The more desperately they struggle, the deeper they sink into the South Vietnamese quagmire. They immediately took up positions, trying to make the South Vietnamese people fight according to their tactics. However, the result was the opposite. The South Vietnamese people forced them to follow the flexible and mobile tactics of the South Vietnamese people, being beaten everywhere. The U.S. imperialists wanted to use the "high mobility" of their troops to concentrate their forces for large-scale "sweeps" and "annihilate" the main forces of the liberation armed forces, destroying the liberated areas. However, as soon as their troops entered South Vietnam, they were overwhelmed by the vast sea of people's war, unable to cope, and had to divide their forces to guard strategic bases and important strongholds, guard transportation lines, which greatly reduced their mobile forces. Despite repeated increases in troops, they were still at their wits' end, lacking manpower. The enemy troops sent out for sweeps, despite being equipped with modern weapons, were blind and deaf on the battlefield, being beaten everywhere. The U.S. imperialists wanted to establish a stable rear in South Vietnam, but the anti-American fury of the people in the U.S.-puppet-controlled areas was burning more fiercely, and the expanding armed struggle in enemy-occupied cities made the enemy find no safe place. The so-called "rural pacification" plan concocted by the U.S. imperialists was at a loss due to the strong resistance of the South Vietnamese people. The repeated defeats of the U.S. troops on the battlefield made the puppet regime shake and accelerated the collapse of the puppet army. The number of deserters from the puppet army this year far exceeded that of last year. According to statistics, the average number of deserters from the puppet army since the beginning of this year has reached 15,000 per month, and by the end of the year, it is estimated to reach 180,000, approximately a quarter of the total strength of the puppet army.

The American paper tiger's true colors are exposed on the South Vietnamese battlefield

Chairman Mao said: "Imperialism is strong on the outside but weak on the inside." "U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries are paper tigers. The struggle of the Chinese people has proven this. The struggle of the Vietnamese people is proving this." Over the past year, the U.S. imperialists have repeatedly clashed with the heroic South Vietnamese people, and the results have repeatedly proven that they are a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside.

The U.S. aggressors launched the so-called "dry season offensive" in the winter and spring of last year, throwing all the mobile forces of the U.S. "elite" troops in South Vietnam into the battlefield, using all modern killing weapons and equipment except nuclear weapons, in an attempt to "annihilate" the main forces of the liberation armed forces. However, the result was an even more disastrous defeat. In the five months of the dry season (from November 1965 to March 1966), the South Vietnamese people annihilated 114,000 enemy troops, including 43,000 U.S. aggressors and mercenaries.

After suffering a disastrous defeat in the dry season, the U.S. troops immediately suffered another defeat in the rainy season. In the rainy season, the liberation army, in close cooperation with the local forces and guerrillas, tightened the encirclement of the U.S. troops, not giving them a chance to breathe, launching continuous attacks on the enemy, fighting a series of brilliant annihilation battles. At the same time, the South Vietnamese people widely carried out guerrilla warfare, dispersing the enemy's forces, making them unable to cope, and using small-scale warfare and continuous attacks as the main means, gradually eating away at the enemy's fighting forces. According to preliminary statistics, from the end of April to October of the rainy season, the South Vietnamese people annihilated 21 enemy battalions and regiments, including 7 U.S. infantry battalions and 3 tank and armored vehicle regiments. In the third quarter alone, 21,000 U.S. aggressors were annihilated, which is equivalent to two-fifths of the U.S. troops sent to South Vietnam in the third quarter.

As they entered the new dry season of this winter and next spring, despite the U.S. increasing the number of troops in Vietnam to the recent 370,000 to 380,000 (the number of U.S. troops at the beginning of last dry season was only 160,000), their new "dry season counteroffensive" was immediately met with a fierce blow. The South Vietnamese people launched fierce attacks on the enemy on various battlefields, smashing the enemy's multiple "sweeps." From October 27 to November 26 alone, the South Vietnamese people annihilated 11,400 enemy troops, including 5,700 U.S. aggressors.

The U.S. imperialists have made many bets in South Vietnam over the past year, but they have failed more miserably than in any other year. The so-called "elite" troops that they boasted about, such as the 1st Cavalry Division and the 1st Infantry Division, have been beaten to pieces, with some units annihilated by more than half.

The U.S. imperialists are accelerating towards complete failure

Chairman Mao said: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic."

The U.S. imperialists have suffered a disastrous defeat and are accelerating towards complete failure. However, they are not willing to admit defeat and are struggling desperately. Since the U.S. held the Manila meeting in October to plan the expansion of the war of aggression, in more than a month, the U.S. imperialists have sent more than 30,000 additional troops to South Vietnam and are continuing to increase their troops, preparing for new military adventures. The U.S. imperialists are also tirelessly creating public opinion for their ground invasion of North Vietnam. They are also colluding more closely with the Soviet revisionist leadership, frantically pushing the sinister plot of "bombing to force peace." Since early December, U.S. bandit aircraft have bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, four times, taking extremely serious "escalation" actions against the Vietnamese people, attempting to force a "peace talks" situation with bombs.

However, the 31 million heroic Vietnamese people are not intimidated. They are actively responding to the battle calls of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, pushing the anti-American, national salvation struggle to new heights, determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors. The Vietnamese people are a true iron wall. In front of this iron wall, the U.S. imperialists will only smash their heads and flow with blood, until they suffer a complete defeat.

    发挥人民战争威力　筑成真正铜墙铁壁
    南越军民打出大好形势决心夺取更大胜利
    今年头十一个月歼美军十万余、伪军十多万，毁敌机近两千架
    美帝战争“升级”失败惨重，勾结苏修玩弄“和谈”阴谋无法挽救败局
    新华社十九日讯　本社记者报道：一九六六年，越南南方军民经过英勇不屈的斗争，打出了空前大好的形势。美帝国主义把它的四分之一以上的陆军和大量的海空军投入南越战场，也未能扭转败局。英雄的越南南方军民发挥人民战争的威力，把美帝国主义打得焦头烂额，拖得精疲力竭，万分狼狈，为今后夺取更大的胜利，打下了稳固的基础。
    美帝国主义脖子上的绞索越拉越紧
    毛主席说：“美帝国主义的手伸得太长了。它每侵略一个地方，就把一条新的绞索套在自己的脖子上。”美帝国主义侵略越南，正是它自己给自己的脖子上套上了一个大绞索，而把绞索的另一端交给了越南人民和全世界人民，它越是扩大侵略战争，进行挣扎，绞索就越拉越紧。
    一九六六年，是美帝国主义向越南人民进行疯狂反扑的一年，也是它在侵越战争中遭到惨败的一年。在这一年中，它的反革命两手策略交替使用。一方面，它大举增兵南越，把侵略军的兵力增加了一倍以上，自己打头阵，进行血腥的大“扫荡”；对越南北方进行更野蛮的轰炸，把侵略战争不断升级。另一方面，它同苏联修正主义集团勾结起来，一次又一次地玩弄“和谈”骗局，妄图用“和谈”的烟幕掩盖其扩大战争的罪行，又妄图用扩大战争的讹诈，压出一个“和谈”的局面，在谈判桌上捞取战场上所捞不到的东西。
    但是英雄的越南人民是吓不倒的，也是骗不了的。他们不对美帝国主义及其走狗的“明智”抱任何幻想，不相信美帝国主义的“好话”，不害怕它的恐吓，他们以果敢的战斗行动，粉碎了美帝国主义的战争讹诈和美苏勾结“以战迫和”、“以炸迫和”、“停炸诱和”的阴谋。
    他们在美国大量增兵的情况下，进一步发展人民游击战争，为美国强盗设下了重重天罗地网。解放武装力量的主力部队、地方部队和民兵游击队紧密配合，以极其机动灵活的战术，在广阔的战场上积极进攻敌人，歼灭了敌军的大量有生力量。从今年一月到十一月底，南越军民共打死、打伤和俘虏敌军二十三万三千多名，其中包括美国侵略军十万零七百多名；击落和击毁敌机一千九百多架。这就是说，今年十一个月美军被歼人数，约等于今年同期美军增兵人数（十八万一千人）的一半还多，等于去年全年美军被歼总数（一万九千二百人）的五倍多。
      白宫和五角大楼的战略计划破产
    十九年前，毛主席就曾经指出，美帝国主义指使它的走狗蒋介石集团大举进犯中国解放区时，“他们过高地估计了自己力量，过低地估计了革命力量，冒险地发动战争，因而落在他们自己布置的陷阱里。我们敌人的战略打算是彻底地输了。”今天，美帝国主义和它的走狗在南越的处境也正是这样。
    手里拿着核武器的美帝国主义，愚蠢地自以为它是“异常强大的”、“举世无敌的”，它自以为它的“王牌军”一开上南越战场，就可以“夺回主动权”，就可以“迅速平定南越”，实现它永远霸占南越的美梦。但是，一年来的战局表明，它已经落在自己布置的陷阱里，它的战略打算是彻底的落空了。
    美帝国主义本想用大军压境，来一个速战速决。但是结果恰恰相反，它愈拚命挣扎，在南越的泥沼中就陷得越深。它一上阵就摆开架势，想叫南越军民按照它的战术打，可是结果适得其反，南越军民迫使它不得不跟着南越军民机动灵活的战术团团转，到处被动挨打。美帝国主义想利用它的军队的“高度机动性”，集中力量进行大“扫荡”，“围歼”解放武装力量的主力，破坏解放区。但是它的军队一进入南越，就陷入人民战争的汪洋大海中，无法应付，它不得不分兵把守战略基地和重要据点，把守交通线，这就使它的机动兵力大为减少，一再增兵，仍然是捉襟见肘，兵力不足。它外出扫荡的军队，尽管有着现代化装备，但是在战场上变成了瞎子、聋子，到处被动挨打。美帝国主义想在南越建立一个稳定的后方，但是美伪统治区人民的反美怒火却越烧越旺，敌占城市里日益扩大的武装斗争使敌人找不到一块安全的地方。美帝国主义拼凑的所谓“乡村绥靖”计划，由于遭到南越人民的强烈反抗而一筹莫展。美军上阵屡战屡败，这就更加使傀儡政权摇摇欲坠，并且加速了伪军的瓦解。伪军今年逃跑的人数就大大超过了去年。据统计，今年年初以来，伪军逃跑的人数每月平均已高达一万五千人，这样到年底预计将达十八万人，约等于伪军总兵力的四分之一。
    美国纸老虎在南越战场上原形毕露
    毛主席说过：“帝国主义是外强中干的。”“美帝国主义和各国反动派都是纸老虎。中国人民的斗争证明了这一点。越南人民的斗争正在证明这一点。”一年来，美帝国主义同英雄的越南南方军民多次较量的结果，一再证明了它是一只十足的外强中干的纸老虎。
    美国侵略者在去冬今春的旱季里气势汹汹地发动了所谓“旱季攻势”，把美国在南越的“精锐”部队的所有机动力量都投入了战场，把除了原子武器以外的现代化杀人武器和现代化装备也都统统使用上，妄图“消灭”解放武装的主力部队。但是，结果是失败得更加惨重。越南南方军民在旱季的五个月（从一九六五年十一月到一九六六年三月）中，共歼灭敌军十一万四千人，其中包括美国侵略军和帮凶军四万三千多人。
    美军在旱季遭到惨败以后，紧接着又在雨季里大吃败仗。在雨季中，解放军同地方部队、游击队密切配合，紧缩歼美包围圈，不让敌人有喘息的机会，接连向敌人发动进攻，打了一连串漂亮的歼灭战。同时，越南南方军民广泛开展游击战，使敌人分散兵力，穷于应付，并且以小规模作战和连续进攻作为主要手段，一口一口地吃掉敌人的有生力量。据初步统计，在从四月底开始到十月份的雨季里，越南南方军民共歼灭美伪军和帮凶军二十一个营和战团，其中包括美国侵略军七个步兵营和三个坦克、装甲车战团。仅在第三季度，美国侵略军就被歼二万一千人，这相当于第三季度增派到南越的美军人数的五分之二。
    在进入今冬明春的新的旱季以后，尽管美国把侵越美军人数增加到最近的三十七、八万人（去年旱季开始时的美军人数只有十六万多人），但是它的新的“旱季反攻”，一开始就遭到了迎头痛击。南越军民在各个战场上猛烈地打击敌人，粉碎了敌人的多次“扫荡”。仅从十月二十七日到十一月二十六日，南方军民就共歼灭敌人一万一千四百名，其中有五千七百名是美国侵略军。
    美帝国主义在过去一年中在南越战场上投的赌注很多，但是失败得比过去任何一年都惨重。被它吹嘘为“最精锐”的“王牌军”，如第一骑兵师、第一步兵师等都被打得落花流水，有的单位被消灭一半以上。
    美帝国主义正在加速走向彻底失败
    毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    美帝国主义已经遭到了惨重的失败，正在加速走向彻底失败。但是，它并不甘心认输，正在进行疯狂的垂死挣扎。自从美国在十月份召开策划扩大侵略战争的马尼拉会议以来，在一个多月中，美帝国主义就向南越增派了三万多名侵略军，并且正在继续增兵，准备进行新的军事冒险。美帝国主义还正在喋喋不休地为它从地面上进攻越南北方制造舆论。它还同苏联修正主义领导集团加紧勾结，猖狂地推行“以炸迫和”的阴谋。十二月初以来，美国强盗飞机四次轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内，对越南人民采取极其严重的“升级”行动，妄图用炸弹压出一个“和谈”的局面来。
    但是，三千一百万英雄的越南人民是吓不倒的。他们正在积极响应胡志明主席和越南南方民族解放阵线的战斗号召，把抗美救国斗争推向新的高潮，决心战胜美国侵略强盗。越南人民是真正的铜墙铁壁。在这个铜墙铁壁前，美帝国主义只会碰得头破血流，直至遭到彻底失败。
