Not long ago, workers in Hefei City, Anhui Province, held a "Chairman Mao Quotation Song Singing Festival."

The old workers' chorus of Anhui Provincial Agricultural Machinery Factory No. 1 consists of fourteen people. These old workers suffered greatly in the old society, and it was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved them from the depths of misery. At the meeting, they sang "The Core Force Leading Our Cause," "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose," and "Strive for Victory" with boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao. The young workers of Hefei Chemical Factory sang "Work is Struggle," "Our Hope Lies in You," and "Strive for Victory" with great passion at the meeting. They said, "Singing Chairman Mao's quotation songs, the red sun rises in our hearts, our blood boils, and we are full of strength."

The chorus of Anhui Textile Factory No. 1, consisting of more than thirty people, are all active learners of Chairman Mao's works and model workers. They regard singing Chairman Mao's quotation songs as a good way to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and they sing them seriously. They sang "The Core Force Leading Our Cause," "Policy and Strategy Are the Life of the Party," "Strive for Victory," and "Our Hope Lies in You" at the meeting. The chorus of active learners of Chairman Mao's works and model workers of Anhui Textile Factory No. 2 also participated in the performance. They said, "We sing Chairman Mao's quotation songs to remember Chairman Mao's teachings at all times. We not only sing ourselves but also teach others to sing, making Chairman Mao's quotations known to every household and forever engraved in people's hearts."

    纵情高唱语录歌心中升起红太阳
    不久以前，安徽省合肥市的工人举行了一次“毛主席语录歌曲演唱大会”。
    省农机一厂老工人合唱队，由十四人组成。这些老工人在旧社会里饱受苦难，是党，是毛主席把他们从苦难的深渊里拯救出来。会上，他们怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情，演唱了《领导我们事业的核心力量》、《凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对》和《争取胜利》这三首语录歌。合肥化工厂青年工人，在会上满怀激情，演唱了《工作就是斗争》、《希望寄托在你们身上》和《争取胜利》等几首语录歌。他们说：“高唱毛主席语录歌，心中升起了红太阳，热血在沸腾，浑身都是力量。”
    安纺一厂三十多人的合唱队队员，全都是学习毛主席著作积极分子和五好职工。他们把演唱毛主席语录歌，当作是活学活用毛主席著作的好形式，认真地学，认真地唱。他们在会上演唱了《领导我们事业的核心力量》、《政策和策略是党的生命》、《争取胜利》和《希望寄托在你们身上》四首语录歌。安纺二厂学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好职工合唱队，也参加了大会演出，他们说：“我们高唱毛主席语录歌，就会时时刻刻记住毛主席的教导。我们不但自己唱，还要教别人唱，把毛主席语录唱得家喻户晓，让毛主席的话永远刻在人们的心中。”
