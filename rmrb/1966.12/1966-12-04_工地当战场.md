The militia squad of Guozhuang treats Chairman Mao's works as spiritual atomic bombs. They study them constantly and apply them in everything they do, learning on-site and applying on-site. Through study, they have gained a fundamental understanding of the nature of imperialism. Core militia member Yang Binghai said: "In the past, I thought that after the U.S. imperialists suffered a defeat in Vietnam, they would pack up and leave automatically. Now I realize that their nature will not change, and we must be prepared to fight!" The word "enemy" is always in the minds of every militia member. Therefore, they have implemented militarization in their actions: they march in formation to and from work; in the barracks, they have achieved three lines, blankets folded into one line, bowls and chopsticks arranged in one line, and bags placed in one line. In construction, they have achieved combat readiness, treating tools as guns and the construction site as a battlefield. They propose the battle cry: "Quickly load, quickly run, pull an extra cart, and that's like eliminating an extra enemy." Therefore, the project quality is good, and the work efficiency is high. That day, when they were digging a drainage ditch, they treated it as building a fortification. With a command, the entire squad of militia members, with a sense of enemy presence, jumped into the water and began the battle. The task originally planned to be completed in one day was finished in just half a day. Militia Company

    工地当战场
    郭庄民兵排把毛主席著作当成精神原子弹。他们时时学、事事用，现场学、现场用。通过学习，对帝国主义的本性有了根本的认识。基干民兵杨兵海说：“过去，我认为美帝在越南吃了败仗之后，会卷起铺盖自动滚蛋的。现在认识到，它的本性不会改变，必须准备打！”每个民兵的头脑中，都有“敌人”二字，所以，他们在行动上实现了军事化：上下工整队；工棚做到了三条线、被叠成一条线、碗筷摆成一条线、包袱放成一条线。在施工中，实现了战斗化，把工具当成枪，工地当战场。提出：快装、快跑、多拉一车，就是多消灭一个敌人的战斗口号。因此，工程质量好，工效高。那天，挖排水沟时，他们当成筑工事，一声令下，全排民兵带着敌情观念，跳下水去，开始了战斗。原计划一天完成的任务，仅用了半天就干完了。民兵连部
