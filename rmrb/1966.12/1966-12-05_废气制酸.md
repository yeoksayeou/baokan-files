Sulfuric acid is a fundamental chemical raw material that plays a significant role in the national economy. In the chemical industry, approximately several thousand products require sulfuric acid as a raw material. Sulfuric acid is also widely used in metallurgy, petroleum, light industry, and defense sectors. The primary raw materials for producing sulfuric acid are typically natural sulfur, pyrite, and sulfur concentrate. Utilizing the large amounts of sulfur-containing waste gases produced during the smelting of non-ferrous metals to manufacture sulfuric acid is an international development trend. This approach not only prevents the release of toxic gases containing sulfur dioxide during smelting from polluting the air, which is harmful to humans, livestock, and crops, but also allows for the comprehensive utilization of resources, reduces investment, and significantly lowers the production cost of sulfuric acid. The establishment of waste gas sulfuric acid plants in China has opened up a broad path for the comprehensive utilization of resources in the metallurgical industry, and has also paved a new way for China to develop the sulfuric acid industry in a rapid, good, and economical manner.

    废气制酸
    硫酸是基本化工原料之一，在国民经济中占着相当重要的地位。在化学工业中，大约有几千种产品需要以硫酸为原料。硫酸还大量应用于冶金、石油、轻工和国防等方面。通常制造硫酸的主要原料是天然硫磺、硫铁矿、硫精砂等。利用冶炼有色金属过程中大量产生的含硫废气制造硫酸，是国际上的一个发展方向。它既可以避免冶炼中排放出来的含有二氧化硫的有毒气体将空气污染，有害于人、畜和庄稼，又可以综合利用资源，节省投资，大大降低硫酸的生产成本。我国废气制酸厂的建成，为我国冶金工业开展资源的综合利用开辟了广阔的途径，也为我国多快好省地发展硫酸工业闯出了一条新路。
