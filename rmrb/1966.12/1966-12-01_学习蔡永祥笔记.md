	Notes on Studying Cai Yongxiang
	Soldier of the People's Liberation Army, Pan Guanghe

	Removing Obstacles

	A train is rushing towards us. If we do not immediately remove the obstacles placed on the tracks by class enemies, a serious accident will occur. The situation is extremely urgent! Cai Yongxiang, disregarding his own safety, rushed towards the obstacle forty meters away. The obstacle was removed! The Red Guards were saved! The Qianjiang River Bridge was preserved! The class enemy's plot to sabotage the Cultural Revolution was foiled!

	Cai Yongxiang's actions on this forty-meter "track" were marked by each step shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, each step pulsating with a heart dedicated to the public good.

	Cai Yongxiang's ability to remove obstacles in times of danger is due to his ability to remove obstacles in the realm of thought. Private thoughts are the greatest obstacles to the revolutionization of thought. Cai Yongxiang, during his lifetime, strived to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to remove obstacles on the path to the revolutionization of his thoughts. He said well: "Private thoughts must be fiercely fought. The 'I' must be fiercely fought, defeated, and crushed. Private thoughts must be deeply excavated. With Mao Zedong Thought, even if the sky falls, one dares to support it." Only by continuously removing obstacles to the revolutionization of thought can one remove obstacles on the train tracks, and remove all obstacles on the revolutionary path!

	"Rolling Up," "Tucking Up," "Taking Off"...

	Cai Yongxiang, when going out, saw workers carrying coal. He rolled up his sleeves, tucked up his pants, and took off his shoes, and helped out. The spirit of "rolling up," "tucking up," and "taking off" is truly precious! "Rolling up," "tucking up," and "taking off" demonstrate the revolutionary quality of "caring for others more than oneself" and promote the revolutionary style of "going among the masses and being with the masses."

	A revolutionary soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who is dedicated to the public good, can "roll up," "tuck up," and "take off" in everyday life, and in times of emergency can be like Dong Cunrui, who "lifted" the explosive package to destroy the enemy fort, like Huang Jiguang, who "blocked" the enemy's gun port with his body to open the path for his comrades, like Liu Yingjun, who "pulled" the reins to save the child in front of the galloping horse, and like Cai Yongxiang, who "rushed" to remove the wood from the tracks...

	Those with "self" at the forefront lack the spirit of "rolling up," "tucking up," and "taking off" in everyday life and have no courage of "lifting," "blocking," "pulling," or "rushing" in times of emergency!

    排除障碍
    列车飞奔而来，如不立即排除阶级敌人在轨道上安下的障碍物，就要发生严重车祸。情况万分紧急！蔡永祥奋不顾身地向着四十多米以外的障碍物冲去。障碍排除了！红卫兵脱险了！钱塘江大桥保住了！阶级敌人妄图破坏文化大革命的阴谋破产了！
    蔡永祥在这四十多米的“跑道”上，一步一个脚印，步步闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉，步步跳动着一颗一心为公的共产主义红心。
    蔡永祥在危险关头排除障碍那样过得硬，是因为他平时在思想领域里排除障碍物过得硬。私心杂念是思想革命化的最大障碍。蔡永祥在生前努力用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来排除自己思想革命化道路上的障碍。他说得好：“私心杂念要猛斗。‘我’字要狠斗，斗倒，斗垮。私心要深挖。有了毛泽东思想，天塌下来也敢顶。”只有不断排除思想革命化上的障碍，才能排除列车轨道上的障碍，才能排除革命道路上的一切障碍！
      “一卷”“一挽”“一脱”……
    蔡永祥外出，看到工人挑煤，他就袖子一卷，裤子一挽，鞋子一脱，帮着干了起来。这“一卷”、“一挽”、“一脱”的精神实在可贵！“一卷”，“一挽”，“一脱”，表现了“关心他人比关心自己为重”的革命品质，发扬了“到群众里面去，和群众在一起”的革命作风。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的一心为公的革命战士，在平时能“一卷”、“一挽”、“一脱”，在紧急关头就能像董存瑞那样为除掉敌堡把炸药包“一举”，像黄继光那样为给战友冲锋开辟道路，用身体向敌人的枪眼上“一堵”，像刘英俊那样为抢救奔马前面的孩子而把缰绳“一拉”，像蔡永祥那样为排除铁轨上的木头而“一冲”……。
      “私”字当头的人，在平时就缺少“一卷”、“一挽”、“一脱”的精神，危急关头更没有“一举”、“一堵”、“一拉”、“一冲”的气概！
