Heart-stirring news has come from overseas. Amidst the great waves of international class struggle, a heroic fighting collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought has emerged.

Forty-one overseas Chinese youth engaged in a serious struggle with the Indonesian reactionaries and achieved a brilliant victory. Their heroic deeds of struggle are widely praised among the people of the motherland and overseas Chinese. This is another triumphant song of great Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao has always taught us that revolutionary fighters of the proletariat must overcome all enemies and never be subdued by them. The forty-one overseas Chinese youth are precisely such revolutionary fighters with a fearless spirit.

In the prisons of the Indonesian reactionaries, facing the guns and bayonets of the fascist police, they were fearless of death, fearless of oppression, fearless of ghosts, and fearless of demons. They remained steadfast and fearless, maintaining the dignity of the Chinese nation and safeguarding the honor of the great motherland. In their presence, the arrogant Indonesian reactionaries were nothing but paper tigers.

They have a clear distinction between love and hate, harboring deep hatred towards the enemy and deep class feelings towards comrades. In the struggle, they encouraged, cared for, and supported each other, uniting as one.

These overseas Chinese youth, who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to the motherland, are truly good fighters of Chairman Mao and good children of the motherland.

Where did the forty-one overseas Chinese youth get their courage, confidence, and strength to fight under the white terror of Indonesian fascism?

It comes from the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon to defeat all enemies. With Mao Zedong Thought, one will have a firm and correct political direction, an indomitable will to struggle, and become the bravest, most intelligent, and most revolutionary person. The forty-one overseas Chinese youth, whether on the prison wagon, behind bars, or in round after round of struggle with the enemy, always insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, taking Chairman Mao's words as the guide for all actions. Mao Zedong Thought is their inexhaustible source of courage to overcome all difficulties and defeat the enemy.

Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the people of our country and in the hearts of all patriotic overseas Chinese. The forty-one young heroes of overseas Chinese have boundless admiration, respect, and love for the great leader Chairman Mao. On the walls of the Indonesian reactionary prison, the young heroes of overseas Chinese wrote with their own blood the words "Long Live Chairman Mao." These blood-written words represent the hearts of forty-one people who love Chairman Mao, and the hearts of millions of patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia who love Chairman Mao. In the critical moment when they were severely persecuted by the Indonesian reactionaries, the words of the beloved leader Chairman Mao always echoed in their ears and were engraved in their hearts, giving them endless warmth and boundless strength, inspiring them to continue the struggle and strive for victory.

Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, our motherland has become a great and powerful socialist country. Our socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved great successes. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is profoundly changing the spiritual and social faces of the people. On the land of the motherland, a new generation is growing, and miracles are happening. All this has greatly inspired the overseas Chinese, making them love the great leader Chairman Mao, the great Chinese Communist Party, and the great motherland even more. Their hearts are closely linked with the seven hundred million people of the motherland.

The heroic deeds of the forty-one overseas Chinese youth have set a brilliant example for the overseas Chinese and also for the people of the entire country. We should learn from these heroes of the Mao Zedong era.

The forty-one overseas Chinese youth, along with some patriotic overseas Chinese who suffered persecution with them, have triumphantly returned to the embrace of the motherland. We extend our highest respect and warm greetings to them.

Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive together for the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our motherland!

    海外传来毛泽东思想的凯歌
    激动人心的消息从海外传来。在国际阶级斗争的大风大浪中，出现了一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的战斗集体。
    四十一个华侨青少年，同印度尼西亚反动派进行了一场严重的搏斗，取得了光辉的胜利。他们英勇斗争的事迹，在祖国人民和海外侨胞中广泛传诵。这是伟大毛泽东思想的又一曲凯歌。
    毛主席历来教导我们，无产阶级革命战士要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。四十一名华侨青少年，就是具有这种大无畏精神的革命战士。
    在印尼反动派的监狱中，他们面对法西斯军警的枪口和刺刀，不怕死，不怕压，不怕鬼，不怕魅，坚贞不屈，无所畏惧，保持了中华民族的气节，维护了伟大祖国的尊严。在他们面前，气焰嚣张的印尼反动派，不过是纸老虎。
    他们爱憎分明，对敌人怀着强烈的仇恨，对同志怀有深厚的阶级感情。在斗争中，他们互相勉励，互相爱护，互相支援，团结得像一个人一样。
    这些忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于祖国的华侨青少年，不愧为毛主席的好战士，祖国人民的好儿女。
    在印尼法西斯的白色恐怖威胁之下，四十一个华侨青少年的斗争勇气、信心和力量从何而来？
    来自伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是战胜一切敌人的最强大最锐利的思想武器。有了毛泽东思想，就会有坚定正确的政治方向，就会有旺盛的斗争意志，就会成为最勇敢、最聪明、最革命的人。四十一个华侨青少年，不论在囚车上，在铁窗下，在同敌人进行一个又一个回合的斗争中，始终坚持活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的话当作一切行动的指南。毛泽东思想，是他们一往无前，排除万难，战胜敌人的取之不竭的源泉。
    毛主席是我国人民心中的红太阳，是所有爱国侨胞心中的红太阳。四十一个华侨小英雄，对伟大的领袖毛主席，无限崇拜，无限敬仰，无限热爱。在印尼反动派监狱的墙上，华侨小英雄用自己的鲜血写下了“毛主席万岁”五个大字。这血凝成的字，代表着四十一颗热爱毛主席的心，代表着成百万颗印尼爱国侨胞热爱毛主席的心。在他们受到印尼反动派疯狂迫害的严重关头，敬爱的领袖毛主席的话，总是响在他们的耳边，记在他们的心上，给他们以无限温暖，无穷力量，鼓舞他们去坚持斗争，争取胜利。
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们的祖国已经成为一个伟大的强盛的社会主义国家。我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，取得了伟大的成就。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，深刻地改变着人民的精神面貌和社会面貌。在祖国的大地上，一代新人正在成长，人间奇迹不断出现。这一切，给了海外侨胞以极大的激励，使他们更加热爱伟大的领袖毛主席，热爱伟大的中国共产党，热爱伟大的祖国。他们的心与祖国七亿人民紧密地联结在一起。
    四十一个华侨青少年的英雄事迹，为海外侨胞树立了一个光辉的榜样，也为全国人民树立了一个光辉的榜样。我们应该向这些毛泽东时代的英雄们学习。
    四十一个华侨青少年，以及同他们一起受迫害的一部分爱国侨胞，已经胜利地回到了祖国的怀抱。我们向他们致以崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问。
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，为祖国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大事业，共同奋斗！
