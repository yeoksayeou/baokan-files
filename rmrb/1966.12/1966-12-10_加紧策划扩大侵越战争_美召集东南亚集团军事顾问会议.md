The U.S. convenes a meeting of military advisors of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 9th, in Bangkok, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, the military advisors' meeting of the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" was held on the 7th and 8th. This meeting, following the plan to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam formulated by the war criminal Johnson at the Manila meeting, discussed the issue of member countries of this aggressive bloc coordinating with the United States to wage the war against Vietnam.

	It is reported that the commander of the U.S. armed forces in the Pacific, Sharp, attended this meeting. The U.S. accomplices and puppets, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Thailand, all sent high-ranking military personnel to attend the meeting. However, Pakistan and France only sent low-ranking officers to attend. The Associated Press reported that this is because these two countries "continue to resist the military activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in practice."

	The communiqué issued by the meeting expressed support for the U.S. expansion of the war against Vietnam and expressed "satisfaction" with some member countries of the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" hastening to serve the U.S. war against Vietnam. The meeting also proposed military and non-military plans to intensify aggressive war activities in the Southeast Asian region.

    加紧策划扩大侵越战争
    美召集东南亚集团军事顾问会议
    据新华社九日讯　曼谷消息：在美帝国主义的操纵下，“东南亚条约组织”军事顾问会议七日和八日在曼谷举行。这次会议按照战争瘟神约翰逊亲自主持的马尼拉会议制定的扩大侵越战争的计划，讨论了这个侵略性集团的成员国配合美国进行侵越战争的问题。
    据报道，美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令夏普出席了这次会议，美国的帮凶和傀儡英国、澳大利亚、新西兰和泰国都派遣高级军事人员出席会议，但是巴基斯坦和法国只派了低级军官出席。美联社的报道说，这是因为这两个国家“继续在实际上抵制东南亚条约组织的军事活动”。
    会议发表的公报表示支持美国扩大侵越战争，对“东南亚条约组织”的一些成员国加紧为美国侵越战争效劳“表示满意”。会议还提出了在东南亚地区加紧进行侵略战争活动的军事计划和非军事计划。
