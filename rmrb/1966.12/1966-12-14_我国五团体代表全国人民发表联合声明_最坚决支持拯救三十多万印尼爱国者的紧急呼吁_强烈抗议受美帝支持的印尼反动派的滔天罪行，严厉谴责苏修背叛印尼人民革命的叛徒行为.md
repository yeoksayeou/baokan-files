The Chinese People's Association for Peace and Disarmament, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, and the Chinese Political and Legal Society today issued a joint statement on behalf of all Chinese people. They strongly condemn and denounce the brutal massacre of Indonesian patriotic and progressive individuals by the right-wing military regime in Indonesia. They fully support the recent urgent appeal by the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization to save the more than 300,000 Indonesian patriots who are currently being persecuted.

The statement says that the right-wing military clique in Indonesia, backed by American imperialism, has, in over a year of reactionary rule, used the most barbaric fascist methods to carry out mass arrests and massacres, turning Indonesia into a living hell of white terror. They have cruelly murdered tens of thousands of Indonesian patriotic and progressive individuals and innocent elderly and women, with more than 300,000 still imprisoned and facing the possibility of being executed at any moment. The horrifying terrorist crimes committed by the Indonesian reactionaries are unprecedented in history. Their savagery fully exposes the reactionary and fascist nature of the right-wing military regime led by Suharto and Nasution, which is determined to oppose the Indonesian people.

The statement points out that the right-wing military regime in Indonesia, which implements anti-communist, anti-people, anti-progressive, and anti-national liberation policies domestically and a mad anti-China and anti-Chinese policy abroad, has received the support and approval of the Soviet revisionist leadership. During the process of the right-wing seizure of power and the massacre of the people in Indonesia, the Soviet revisionist clique has continued to supply modern weapons to Indonesia, which the right-wing military clique uses to slaughter Indonesian Communist Party members and all patriotic democrats. The Soviet revisionist leadership recently even invited the foreign minister of the Indonesian right-wing military regime, Malik, to visit the Soviet Union, engaging in dirty political deals with this fascist butcher whose hands are stained with the blood of the people. The treacherous behavior of the Soviet revisionists in betraying the Indonesian people's revolution once again exposes their traitorous face.

The statement emphasizes that the killers like Suharto and Nasution will, like all reactionaries, be thrown into the dustbin of history by the revolutionary people. History has proven that the more reactionaries kill, the greater the revolutionary force becomes, and the closer they come to destruction. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, has said: "The various forms of oppression and persecution inflicted by the reactionaries on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote a broader and more intense revolution." No matter how ferocious and savage the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia may be for a time, in reality, they are nothing but paper tigers, which will ultimately be pierced and smashed by the Indonesian people, receiving the merciless judgment of history.

The statement expresses that the 700 million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will forever stand firmly on the side of the Indonesian people and on the side of all revolutionary people. We believe that the Indonesian people will further unite, overcome all difficulties, and use resolute struggle to defeat all attacks by the reactionary forces. The future of the Indonesian people is bright, and their revolutionary cause will surely achieve final victory.

    我国五团体代表全国人民发表联合声明
    最坚决支持拯救三十多万印尼爱国者的紧急呼吁
    强烈抗议受美帝支持的印尼反动派的滔天罪行，严厉谴责苏修背叛印尼人民革命的叛徒行为
    新华社十三日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中华全国总工会、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国青年联合会、中国政治法律学会今天代表全国各界人民发表联合声明，强烈抗议和严厉谴责印度尼西亚右派军人政权大规模野蛮屠杀印度尼西亚爱国进步人士的滔天罪行，最坚决地支持印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织最近发出的为拯救正在遭受迫害的三十多万印度尼西亚爱国者的紧急呼吁书的正义立场。
    声明说，受到美帝国主义支持的印度尼西亚右派军人集团，在一年多的反动统治期间，以最野蛮的法西斯手段，实行大逮捕、大屠杀，把印度尼西亚变成了白色恐怖的人间地狱。他们残酷地杀害了几十万印度尼西亚的爱国进步人士和无辜的老弱妇孺，现在还有三十多万人被囚禁着，随时有被投上屠场的可能。印度尼西亚反动派的这种骇人听闻的恐怖罪行，是史无前例的。他们的野蛮残暴，完全暴露了以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的右派军人政权决心与印度尼西亚人民为敌的反动的法西斯面目。
    声明指出，印度尼西亚右派军人政权在国内实行的反共、反人民、反进步、反民族解放和对外执行的疯狂反华排华政策，受到苏联修正主义领导集团的支持和赏识。在印度尼西亚右派篡夺政权和屠杀人民的过程中，苏修集团一直继续把现代化的武器运进印度尼西亚，让右派军人集团用来屠杀印度尼西亚共产党人和一切爱国民主人士。苏联修正主义领导集团最近还邀请了印度尼西亚右派军人政权的外交部长马利克到苏联访问，同这个双手沾满人民鲜血的法西斯刽子手进行肮脏的政治交易。苏联修正主义者背叛印度尼西亚人民革命的行为再一次暴露了它的大叛徒的嘴脸。
    声明强调说，杀人的刽子手苏哈托—纳苏蒂安之流必将同一切反动派一样，被革命的人民扔进历史的垃圾堆。历史证明，反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近灭亡。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说过：各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”不管印度尼西亚右派反动势力如何猖狂凶恶于一时，实际上它不过是一只纸老虎，到头来终将被印度尼西亚人民戳穿敲碎，受到历史的无情审判。
    声明表示，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，永远最坚定地站在印度尼西亚人民一边，站在一切革命人民一边。我们相信，印度尼西亚人民必将进一步团结起来，冲破重重困难，用坚决的斗争来击败反动势力的一切进攻。印度尼西亚人民的前途是光明的，他们的革命事业一定会取得最后的胜利。
