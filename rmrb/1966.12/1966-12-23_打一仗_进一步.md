Revolutionary people can indeed learn warfare through warfare. Chairman Mao said: “There is a distance between the ‘common people’ and soldiers, but it is not an insurmountable Great Wall; it can be quickly eliminated. Engaging in revolution and warfare is the method to eliminate this distance.” The history of China’s revolutionary wars fully proves this point. Our army is composed of “common people” wearing military uniforms. The history of our army’s growth is the history of “common people” in military uniforms learning warfare through warfare.

In the spring of 1945, the Party organization sent me to the Taihang Mountains to serve as the political instructor of the newly established Second Company of a certain regiment of the Eighth Route Army. The Second Company had over a hundred new recruits, all of whom were impoverished farmers who had suffered double oppression from Japanese imperialism and the reactionary Kuomintang. They harbored a deep hatred for the nation and class enemies, and with burning indignation, they laid down their hoes, donned military uniforms, and joined the ranks of the revolutionary armed struggle. These “slaves” who had been trampled under the enemy’s iron hooves understood from Chairman Mao’s teachings that only by seizing weapons from the enemy and learning warfare through warfare could they completely defeat the enemy and liberate themselves.

The Second Company participated in the fierce battle to capture Qujiao Town, which was the company’s first battle. Our equipment consisted of two people sharing a “Hubei rifle” or “old musket,” and some soldiers used large swords and spears. In terms of weapons and combat experience, we were no match for the Japanese puppet army. However, in terms of political quality, we were superior to any enemy. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the determination to drive out the Japanese invaders and achieve liberation gave all our soldiers and officers the heroic spirit to overcome all enemies.

After the battle began, the first platoon, which was assigned to the assault team, quickly broke through the outer defenses of Qujiao Town in coordination with the brother units, like a sharp blade piercing the enemy’s heart, and scattered the enemy’s division headquarters and a security regiment like a flock of sheep, causing chaos. The second and third platoons tightly surrounded the enemy command post in a courtyard. The enemy put up a desperate resistance, but we firmly held their throats, seeking to annihilate them completely. The fourth squad leader seized the enemy’s weakness, leading the entire squad to cleverly and actively attack from the enemy’s flank and rear, jumping over the wall and into the back courtyard, causing the enemy to panic and hastily respond. The entire battle lasted less than an hour, and our company annihilated an entire enemy division headquarters, killing and capturing over seventy enemy officers, including the division commander. The newly established Second Company thus, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fought a brilliant first battle.

After the first battle, we organized the soldiers to evaluate achievements, command, tactics, and actions based on Chairman Mao’s teaching of “fight a battle, advance a step,” to summarize experiences and further study and master the laws of warfare. Later, we fought more than ten battles and achieved the annihilation of over a thousand enemies in the first year of the company’s establishment, writing the first glorious page in the company’s history. In this way, the Second Company grew and was tempered in warfare. During the War of Liberation and the Korean War, the Second Company became a steel-like fighting collective that could attack and defend, and was indestructible.

In the years of warfare, our soldiers often enlisted yesterday and had to fight today. History has proven that we not only can fight but also can fight and win. This is because we are soldiers of the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The war we wage is a just people’s revolutionary war. Our people’s soldiers have learned warfare through the people’s revolutionary war. Today, revolutionary people in many regions of the world are engaging in revolution and seeking liberation, following the path we once took. All revolutionary people of the world will definitely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, learn warfare through warfare, and bury American imperialism and the reactionary forces of various countries in the vast sea of the world’s people’s revolutionary war, establishing a new world without imperialism and capitalism.

    打一仗　进一步
    左三星
    革命人民是完全可以从战争学会战争的。毛主席说：“从‘老百姓’到军人之间有一个距离，但不是万里长城，而是可以迅速地消灭的，干革命，干战争，就是消灭这个距离的方法。”中国的革命战争史充分证明了这一点。我们的军队，就是穿着军装的“老百姓”。我军成长的历史，就是穿军装的“老百姓”在战争中学会战争的历史。
    一九四五年春，党组织派我到太行山区八路军某团新建立的二连担任指导员。二连一百多新兵，全是饱受日本帝国主义和国民党反动派双重压迫的贫苦农民。他们怀着雪民族恨，报阶级仇的满腔怒火，放下锄头，换上军装，投身到革命武装斗争的行列里来。这些在敌人铁蹄下惨遭蹂躏的“奴隶”，从毛主席的教导中懂得了只有从敌人手里夺过武器，从战争学会战争，才能彻底打败敌人，解放自己。
    二连参加了强攻曲沟集的战斗，这是二连建立后的第一仗。我们的装备是：两个人合使一支“湖北条子”或“老套筒”，有的战士使的是大刀、长矛。论武器，论实战经验，都不能与日伪军相比。但是论政治质量，却是任何敌人都比不过的。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，驱逐日寇闹翻身的决心，使我们全体指战员都具备了足以压倒一切敌人的英雄气概。
    战斗发起后，担任突击队的一排，协同兄弟连队，迅速突破曲沟集外围阵地，像尖刀一样直插敌人心脏，把敌人的一个旅部和一个保安团打得像散了群的山羊，乱成一团。二、三排将敌指挥所紧紧地包围在一个院落里。敌人负隅顽抗，我们死死卡住敌人的脖子，力求全歼。四班长抓住敌人的弱点，主动机智地带领全班，从敌人侧后，翻越围墙，跳进后院，使敌人惊慌失措，仓皇应战。整个战斗不到一小时，我连全歼敌一个旅指挥部，毙俘敌旅长以下七十余名。新建的二连，就是这样紧紧依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，漂亮地打赢了第一仗。
    第一仗下来，我们根据毛主席打一仗进一步的教导，组织战士评功，评指挥，评战术，评动作，总结经验，进一步研究和掌握战争规律。以后，我们又打了十几仗，在建连一周年时取得了歼敌一千余名的胜利，给连队写下了第一页光荣的历史。就这样，二连在战争中锻炼成长起来了。在解放战争和抗美援朝战争中，二连成为一个能攻善守，攻不垮、打不烂的钢铁战斗集体。
    在战争年代，我们的战士常常是昨天入伍，今天就要打仗的。历史证明，我们不仅能打，而且能打得赢。这是因为我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民战士。我们进行的战争是正义的人民革命战争。我们的人民战士在人民革命战争中学会了战争。今天，世界上许多地区的革命人民，正在干革命，闹翻身，走我们过去走过的道路。全世界革命人民，一定能按照毛主席所指引的道路，从战争中学会战争，把美帝国主义和各国反动派彻底埋葬在世界人民革命战争的汪洋大海之中，建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义的新世界。
