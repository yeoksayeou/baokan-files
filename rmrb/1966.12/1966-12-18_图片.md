The massive publication of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" is a crucial measure for the broad masses to grasp Mao Zedong Thought and promote the ideological revolution among the Chinese people. We hope that every comrade will study it diligently and with perseverance, and initiate a new wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works nationwide. Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, let us strive to build our country into a great socialist state with modern agriculture, modern industry, modern science and culture, and modern national defense!

	Chairman Mao's words are the treasures of the revolution. Singing the songs of quotations boosts morale, overcomes all difficulties, and dares to scale the heights. Workers at the Shanghai Refining Plant sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations before starting their shifts. Inspired by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they work and struggle with high spirits!

	With boundless love for Chairman Mao, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, study Chairman Mao's many fundamental viewpoints repeatedly to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, memorize some aphorisms, and apply them repeatedly. This is a communication company's cadres and soldiers in the Shenyang Military Region singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations.

	Communes' broad masses of members study Chairman Mao's quotations with questions in mind, transforming their worldviews. The entire countryside has seen a new wave of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Members of the Fuxing People's Commune in Xinzhou County, Hubei, relying on Mao Zedong Thought, overcame a once-in-a-century drought and achieved a bumper harvest of late-season rice. This is the first brigade's cadres and members studying Chairman Mao's quotations in the fields.

	Chairman Mao's words shine like gold, guiding the revolutionary path. Red Guards on footlink tours study Chairman Mao's quotations at all times and in all places, combining them with reality to raise their ideological understanding and boost their victorious spirit. They are determined to undergo trials and broaden their horizons during their footlink tours, study Mao Zedong Thought, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and temper themselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	The great Mao Zedong Thought nurtures the growth of a new generation. The broad revolutionary youth of our country bravely step into society, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and do good deeds. This is a group of children in Beijing leading passengers to read Chairman Mao's quotations on a public bus.

	Students sent back to China by the Soviet government, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, remained vigilant when revisionists tried to corrupt them ideologically and in their lives, leaving no room for infiltration. They said: "Every time we read Chairman Mao's books, we feel infinitely warm and full of strength."

	Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon to defeat all enemies. Forty-one overseas Chinese youth, taking Chairman Mao's words as their guide to action, engaged in a serious struggle with the Indonesian reactionaries and achieved a brilliant victory. On their way back to the motherland, when they received the radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they enthusiastically shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"
