Dear Red Guards and young revolutionaries!

Today, let us discuss how the People's Liberation Army studies and applies Chairman Mao's works while on the march.

Everyone knows that the People's Liberation Army was personally founded by our great leader Chairman Mao and has grown strong under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The People's Liberation Army has been able to grow from small to large and from weak to strong, defeating powerful domestic and foreign enemies, and becoming a highly proletarian and combat-ready revolutionary army. This is entirely the result of Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army hold deep proletarian feelings for the supreme commander, Chairman Mao, and love him and Mao Zedong Thought dearly. Over the years, under the call of Comrade Lin Biao, the entire army has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao," has become the action guideline for every officer and soldier in the army. They regard Chairman Mao's works as "food," "weapons," and "compasses." Wherever they go, they study there. Even on the march, they do not miss any opportunity to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

How does one study and apply Chairman Mao's works while on the march?

The most important thing is to link theory with practice, to study in the midst of struggle, and to apply what is learned in the midst of struggle. There are different types of marches: rapid marches for combat missions and general marches under normal conditions. The tasks, purposes, and situations of marches are different, and so are the reflections in one's thoughts. Therefore, one must distinguish between different situations and organize officers and soldiers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works flexibly and purposefully.

In combat situations, especially during forced marches, the troops march day and night with little rest and easily become fatigued. It is precisely at such times that strong political and ideological work is especially needed, and Mao Zedong Thought must be at the helm. One must know that the more difficult and challenging the situation, the greater the encouragement and strength that every word and every letter of Chairman Mao provides for officers and soldiers. For example, a certain "Red Army Regiment" of the Kunming troops successfully completed a mountain and forest combat march exercise under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The area where they marched was a vast forest. Here, the cliffs are steep, ancient trees towering, thorns everywhere, and moss covering the ground. To complete this difficult march, the regiment party committee from the beginning required the troops to study Chairman Mao's works extensively, especially organizing the troops to study Chairman Mao's discussions on overcoming difficulties and promoting revolutionary heroism. They cultivated the troops' spirit of not fearing hardships and fatigue, and a fearless fighting spirit. Before the march, cadres at all levels personally lectured the soldiers on Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, helping them select articles and find quotations; during the march, they guided the soldiers to seize every opportunity to study. When climbing steep slopes and mountains, and feeling physically tired, they organized the soldiers to study Chairman Mao's discussions on work being struggle and daring to take on heavy burdens; when marching continuously day and night, they organized the soldiers to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains"; when under the scorching sun and thirsty, they organized the soldiers to study Chairman Mao's discussions on unity and mutual aid. To adapt to the inconveniences of movement in the mountains and forests, they also created some practical study methods. On the march, soldiers carried small bamboo plaques and paper slips with Chairman Mao's quotations. Whenever they encountered difficulties, they would take out the relevant quotations, read a passage, and discuss. Some adopted the method of studying a bit during short rests, a section during long rests, and a full article when stopping. The soldiers acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings, having a "compass" in their minds. Although the forest was vast and the difficulties were numerous, they opened up a path to victory and successfully completed the task of marching through the forest.

In situations where small teams act independently, the soldiers of the Liberation Army also consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Once, a small team was on patrol duty in a desert area. On the march, there were few people, and they walked through deserts, marshes, and saline-alkali lands. Sometimes they couldn't find a drop of fresh water. The soldiers had to camp in the wilderness, eating their own dry rations and drinking bitter, salty water. In these difficult conditions, they, with strong class feelings and astonishing willpower, insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works while on duty. One afternoon, everyone was so hungry and tired that they could hardly walk. The soldiers then held up the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and walked step by step. At this moment, Chairman Mao's benevolent face seemed to be right in front of them, and Chairman Mao's teachings of "firmly making up your mind, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory" seemed to be ringing in their ears. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought gave them boundless strength, and they persisted until they reached their destination. They finally overcame one difficulty after another and successfully completed the glorious mission of patrolling eight thousand miles.

Wild camping or general marching is the best time for the troops to interact with the masses, familiarize themselves with society, and learn from workers and peasants. Many units pay attention to conducting social investigations during wild camping and invite local old workers, old poor peasants, and old revolutionaries to give reports to the soldiers. In this way, they closely link with the local social situation to study Chairman Mao's works, making it easier for the soldiers to understand, remember, and actively apply what they learn. The nationally famous "Eighth Company of Nanjing Road" does this. Once, the Eighth Company left Shanghai and went to the countryside for wild camping. As soon as they entered the wild camping area, the company party branch organized the soldiers to study Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and other articles, letting the officers and soldiers live in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, working and having heart-to-heart talks with them, listening to their family histories, village histories, and commune histories. The poor and lower-middle peasants' clear class stance gave the soldiers a vivid class education. The soldiers said: We grew up in the sweet water of the new society, and we have no whip scars from landlords on our bodies, nor dog bite marks on our legs. But the bitterness of the old society and the blood debt, we must never forget. This method of combining theory with practice made the soldiers understand Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" more deeply.

In places with conditions, many units also organize soldiers to study Chairman Mao's works together with local workers and peasants, to read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together, to hold lectures and exchange experiences on studying Chairman Mao's works. Some workers and peasants, although they may not be well-educated, have deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works. Their shared experiences are rich in content, profound in meaning, and vivid in language. The soldiers can draw valuable nourishment from them and learn things that cannot be learned in the barracks.

The great Mao Zedong Thought inspires us to march forward bravely.

    行军中怎样学习毛主席著作
    亲爱的红卫兵战士们，亲爱的革命小将们！今天，我们来谈一谈人民解放军在行军中是怎样活学活用毛主席著作的。
    大家知道，人民解放军是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的，是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长壮大起来的。人民解放军所以能够从小到大，从弱到强，战胜了强大的国内外敌人，成为非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命军队，完全是毛主席英明领导的结果。人民解放军的广大指战员，对最高统帅毛主席怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想。这些年来，在林彪同志的号召下，全军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”，已经成为全军每一个干部战士的行动准则。他们把毛主席著作当做“粮食”、“武器”和“方向盘”。走到哪里，学到哪里。在行军路上，也不放过一切机会活学活用毛主席著作。
    在行军情况下，怎样活学活用毛主席著作呢？
    最重要的，就是要联系实际，在斗争中学，在斗争中用。行军有执行战斗任务的急行军和在一般情况下的行军。行军的任务、目的、情况不同，思想反映也不同。这就要区分各种不同的情况，灵活地和有针对性地组织干部战士活学活用毛主席著作。
    在战斗情况下的行军，尤其是强行军，部队日夜兼程前进，休息时间少，容易疲劳。正是在这种时候，特别需要强有力的政治思想工作，特别需要用毛泽东思想挂帅。要知道，越是在艰难困苦的场合，毛主席的每一句话、每一个字，对干部战士都是巨大的鼓舞力量。例如，昆明部队某部“红军团”，用毛泽东思想挂帅，胜利地完成了一次山林地战斗行军演习任务。他们行军的地区，是一片林海。这里山崖陡峭，古树参天，荆棘遍地，到处长着苔藓。为了完成这次困难的行军任务，团党委一开始就要求部队大学毛主席著作，特别注意组织部队学习毛主席关于战胜困难，发扬革命英雄主义的论述。培养部队不怕困难，不怕疲劳的硬骨头作风和一往无前的战斗精神。行军前，各级干部亲自给战士们讲毛主席的有关教导，帮助他们选文章、找语录；行军中及时指导战士抓紧各种时机进行学习。爬大坡，上大山，身体疲劳时，就组织战士学习毛主席关于工作就是斗争，勇于挑重担子的论述；连续行军，昼夜兼程前进时，就组织战士学习《愚公移山》；烈日当头，缺水口渴时，就组织战士学习毛主席关于团结互助的论述。为了适应山林地行动不便的特点，他们还创造了一些切合实际的学习方法。行军路上，战士们都带了写着毛主席语录的小竹板和纸条，遇到什么困难，就拿出有关语录念上一段，议论一番。有的采取小休息学一点，大休息学一段，住下来学一篇的办法。战士们按照毛主席的教导办事，思想上有了“指北针”，尽管林海茫茫，困难重重，他们却开辟出一条胜利的道路，圆满地完成了穿林行军任务。
    在小分队单独行动的情况下，解放军的战士们也能自觉地活学活用毛主席著作。有一次，一支小分队，在沙漠地区执行巡逻任务。在行军路上，人烟稀少，走的尽是沙漠、沼泽和盐碱地。有时找不到一滴甜水。战士们不得不露宿荒野，吃着自带的干粮，喝着苦咸的水。在这困难的情况下，他们怀着强烈的阶级感情，以惊人的毅力，坚持在执勤中活学活用毛主席著作。一天下午，大家走得又饥又累，实在走不动了。战士们就手举着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，一步一步向前走。这时，毛主席慈祥的面容，好像就在他们眼前，毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，好像就响在他们耳边。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，使他们增添了无穷无尽的力量，坚持到达了目的地。他们终于战胜了一个又一个的困难，圆满地完成了巡逻八千里的光荣任务。
    野营行军，或一般情况下的行军，这是部队接触群众，熟悉社会，向工农学习的最好时机。许多部队在野营时，都注意作社会调查，请当地的老工人、老贫农、老革命前辈给战士作报告。这样，密切联系当地的社会情况，学习毛主席著作，战士们容易懂，记得牢，学得活，学得好。全国闻名的“南京路上好八连”就是这样做的。有一次，好八连离开上海，到农村去野营。一进入野营地区，八连党支部就组织战士们学习毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》等文章，让干部战士住到贫下中农家里，一面劳动，一面和贫下中农促膝谈心，听他们讲家史、村史、社史。贫下中农爱憎分明的阶级立场，使战士们受到了一次生动的阶级教育。战士们说：我们在新社会的甜水里成长，身上没有地主抽的鞭痕，腿上没有恶狗咬的伤疤，但是旧社会的阶级苦，血泪仇，我们一刻也不能忘。这种理论联系实际的学习方法，使战士们对毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》这篇光辉著作领会得更深刻了。
    在有条件的地方，许多部队还组织战士和当地的工农群众一起学习毛主席著作，一起朗读《毛主席语录》，一起开讲用会，交流学习毛主席著作心得体会。有些工农群众虽然识字不多，但是，他们对毛主席著作有着深厚的阶级感情，他们谈的心得体会，有丰富的内容，深刻的道理，生动的语言。战士们可以从中吸取宝贵的营养，学到在营房里学不到的东西。（附图片）
