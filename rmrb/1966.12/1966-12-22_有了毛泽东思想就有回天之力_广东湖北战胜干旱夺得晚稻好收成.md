With Mao Zedong Thought, there is the power to turn the tide. Farmers in Guangdong and Hubei provinces, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have displayed unyielding revolutionary will and boundless revolutionary enthusiasm to overcome severe drought and achieve a bumper late rice harvest.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 21st: Farmers in Guangdong Province, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have overcome a severe autumn drought with unyielding revolutionary will and boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, achieving a bumper late rice harvest.

Since August this year, Guangdong Province has experienced three to four months without rain or significant rainfall. Late rice fields severely affected by drought accounted for nearly one-third of the province's late rice planting area. However, Guangdong farmers launched a new wave of studying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, and achieved a brilliant victory in the anti-drought struggle. Currently, the late rice has been harvested. According to preliminary statistics from relevant departments, the province's total late rice production has increased by about 10% compared to last year's bumper harvest.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 19th: Following the bumper harvest of early and mid-season rice, Hubei Province's 7.7 million mu of double-cropping late rice has also achieved large-scale and significant increases in production. Many prefectures and counties have increased production by four to five times or even more compared to last year.

Since last winter, Hubei Province has experienced a prolonged period of below-average rainfall. Just as the critical period for late rice transplantation arrived, drought conditions became widespread and persisted until early October, making it one of the most severe droughts in decades. Under the threat of severe drought, the vast number of commune members across the province, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory," engaged in a tenacious struggle against the drought. Therefore, this year's double-cropping late rice area not only did not decrease but also expanded by more than 1.1 million mu compared to last year.

    有了毛泽东思想就有回天之力
    广东湖北战胜干旱夺得晚稻好收成
    据新华社广州二十一日电用毛泽东思想武装起来的广东省农民，以坚定的革命意志和冲天的革命干劲，战胜了特大秋旱，夺得晚稻好收成。
    从今年八月起，广东全省连续三四个月没有下雨或没有下过大雨，严重受旱的晚稻田曾占全省晚稻种植面积的将近三分之一。但是，广东农民掀起了大规模的学习毛主席著作的新高潮，用毛泽东思想作武器，促进人的思想革命化，取得了抗旱斗争的辉煌胜利。目前，晚稻已经收割完毕，据有关部门初步统计，全省晚稻总产量比丰收的去年又增长一成左右。
    据新华社武汉十九日电湖北省继早中稻丰收之后，全省七百七十多万亩双季晚稻，又获得大面积大幅度增产。不少专区和县比去年增产四五成甚至更多。
    湖北省从去年冬季以来，长期雨量偏少。正当晚稻插秧的关键时期，旱象又普遍发生，一直持续到十月初，是几十年来罕见的大旱。在严重的旱情威胁下，全省广大人民公社社员，按照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，同旱灾展开了顽强的搏斗。因此，今年双季晚稻面积不仅没有减少，而且比去年还扩大了一百一十多万亩。
