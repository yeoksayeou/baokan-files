The hardest job on the construction site is pulling the carts. In the eight days since I arrived at the site, I have always volunteered to pull the carts. However, some people only load the carts and do not want to do the hard work. I feel a bit cheated. Is this considered being cheated? In the evening, I opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read, "Hard work is like a burden placed before us, see if we dare to shoulder it. Burdens are light and heavy. Some people pick the light ones and push the heavy ones to others. This is not a good attitude. But some comrades are not like this. They let others enjoy the benefits first, pick the heavy burdens, and put hard work before enjoyment. Such comrades are good comrades." I read this passage several times, and my mind became clear: volunteering to shoulder heavy burdens is not being cheated, but an honor. I should be willing to shoulder heavy burdens, and the more others do not want to do the hard and heavy work, the more I should volunteer to do it. This is in line with Chairman Mao's teachings. Yes, in the future, I will continue to pull the carts, and with even more enthusiasm, use my actions to influence those who do not want to do heavy work.

Our team's comrades have decided to turn the team into a school of Mao Zedong Thought. I am a student of this great school, and I am truly happy from the bottom of my heart! I will definitely strive to be a good student. At the meeting, I declared my resolution and challenged my younger brother Xiao Hui to a revolutionary competition, aiming to be "brothers in arms." The challenge letter is as follows: "Compare studying and applying 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong'; compare thoughts with actions; compare effort with work efficiency; compare unity with style."

Xiao Hui also did not back down, and in his response letter, he wrote: "My thoughts: follow Chairman Mao's teachings and serve the people wholeheartedly; my actions: resolutely, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory; my style: face difficulties head-on, let go of honors, learn from the advanced, and help the backward."

After entering the school of Mao Zedong Thought, today I feel especially energetic. The cart is loaded like a small mountain, and I pull it very quickly, creating the highest record in the team.

Our squad has been fighting in the mud for ten whole days. My legs have been swollen by the shovel. Some comrades advised me, "Xiaoheng, your legs are swollen like this, don't soak them in water anymore, or they will be ruined." I said, "What's the big deal? Comrade Norman Bethune gave his life for our Chinese revolution, and we retreat just because our legs are swollen a bit? Are we still students of the school of Mao Zedong Thought?" To be honest, my legs hurt, but thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, I think to myself, serving the people means not fearing difficulties, and we must persist and not retreat in the face of difficulties. Students of the school of Mao Zedong Thought must be modern-day Yu Gong, only then can we be worthy of the great leader Chairman Mao!

    要乐于挑重担子
    ——水利工地民工日记摘抄

    工地上的活数拉车子最累，我来到工地这八天，一直抢着拉车子。可是个别人，光是装车，不愿干累活。我觉着自己有点吃亏。这算不算吃亏呢？晚上，我打开《毛主席语录》，毛主席说：“艰苦的工作就像担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。有的同志不是这样，享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。”我把这一段反复读了几遍，心里亮堂了：抢挑重担子不是吃亏，而是光荣。我应该乐于挑重担子，越是别人不愿干的苦活累活，越是要抢在头里干，这才是符合毛主席的教导。对，今后我要照常拉车子，而且劲头要更大，用实际行动去带动不愿干重活的人。

    我们连的同志决心把连队办成毛泽东思想大学校。我是这座大学校的一名学生了，真是从心眼里高兴！我一定努力做一名好学生。在会上，我表了决心，并向我弟弟小辉提出开展革命竞赛，争当“哥俩好”。挑战书是这样写的：“比学
  ‘毛选’看活用；比思想看行动；比干劲看工效；比团结看风格。”
    小辉也不示弱，他在应战书中写道：“我的思想：听从毛主席的教导，全心全意为人民服务；我的行动：下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利；我的风格：见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮。”
    进了毛泽东思想大学校，今天我身上觉着格外有劲，车子装得像小山似的，还拉得飞快，创造了全连最高纪录。

    我们突击队在泥水里激战，今天整整十天了。我的腿也叫铁锨把磨肿了。有的同志劝我说：“小恒，你的腿肿成这样了，别在水里泡着啦，泡坏了可不是闹着玩的。”我说：“这算个什么？人家白求恩为咱中国革命，献出生命都不怕，咱腿肿了点就打退堂鼓，还算什么毛泽东思想大学校的学生！”说心里话，腿是疼呵，可是想起毛主席的教导，我心里说，为人民服务就不怕困难，就要坚持干，决不能在困难面前退缩。毛泽东思想大学校的学生，要做当代愚公，才能对得起伟大领袖毛主席！
