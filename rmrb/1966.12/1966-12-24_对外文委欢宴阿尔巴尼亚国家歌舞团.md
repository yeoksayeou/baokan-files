The Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the Albanian People's Republic National Song and Dance Ensemble, led by Director B. Pejo and Deputy Director R. Hado, on their visit to China for performances.

The banquet was filled with a very warm and enthusiastic atmosphere from beginning to end. When the artistic comrades from the front lines against imperialism and revisionism entered the banquet hall, the hosts and guests warmly embraced each other, shook hands enthusiastically, and chanted in rhythm, "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong." During the banquet, Zhang Ziyu, Director of the Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee, and relevant officials Liu Xiao, Chu Tunan, He Biao, Zhou Yi Ping, Li Wei, and capital cultural workers, had warm conversations with the Albanian comrades, discussing the revolutionary fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania. They raised their glasses to toast the health of our beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the beloved leader of the Albanian people and close friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. At the banquet, artists from China and Albania sang "The East Is Red," "The Ship Sails on with the Helmsman at the Tiller," and the Albanian song "Song of the Eagle."

Zhang Ziyu and Director B. Pejo spoke at the banquet. They jointly toasted the revolutionary solidarity and fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, which are based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and expressed the hope that this solidarity and friendship would be further strengthened in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership.

The delegation led by P. Dode, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Korça People's Assembly, and Albanian Ambassador to China Vasili Nataneli were also invited to attend the banquet.
