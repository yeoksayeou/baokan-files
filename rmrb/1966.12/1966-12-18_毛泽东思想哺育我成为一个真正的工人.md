I am a railroad switchman. On the morning of October 10th, at seven ten, in a moment of extreme urgency, I risked my life to prevent a major collision between a special train carrying Red Guards and a freight train, thereby saving the lives of more than a thousand Red Guards, protecting state property, and safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

This is what I should have done. I was able to do this because I have been studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm my mind, deeply excavating my selfishness, fiercely battling the "I," and firmly establishing the "public." I have been continuously transforming my worldview; this is the result of the Party's continuous cultivation and education of me; it is also the result of the patient help from the people around me.

Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, there would be nothing for Wu Dianlin. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of our working class. I love Chairman Mao the most, and I love reading Chairman Mao's books the most. Chairman Mao's books have educated me into a true worker.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's soul is the only way to become a true and thorough revolutionary.

Someone with a good background, who has suffered deeply in the old society, naturally has boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and wants to repay the Party and Chairman Mao's kindness. However, if one thinks carefully, this kind of pure "repayment" thought stems from the "I," and is not a true and thorough revolutionary thought. If a person does not establish a thought of wholeheartedly serving the revolution, their revolutionary enthusiasm will not be solid, their revolutionary spirit will not be enduring, they will not have a grand revolutionary ideal, and they will not become a true and thorough revolutionary.

In the old society, my hatred ran deep. Whenever I thought of the old society, I hated it to the core.

After liberation, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao rescued me from the sea of suffering. Comparing the past with the present, I have boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and for today's new society. This pure class sentiment made me develop a strong desire to repay the kindness.

Not long after liberation, I joined the people's railway work with this desire to repay kindness. Because my understanding of the purpose of the revolution was not clear, my revolutionary spirit was not conscious. At first, working at the station, I put all my effort into it. The leadership told me to do something, and I did it. Later, the leadership promoted me to be the train dispatcher, and I worked even harder, getting up early and staying up late, without knowing what hardship or fatigue was. However, the revolutionary enthusiasm fueled by the desire to repay kindness could not last long. After just a few years, I felt that the job of train dispatcher was too hard, getting up early and staying up late, coming and going in the wind and rain. Coupled with poor health, I requested the leadership to transfer me to the station to work as a switchman.

From my personal experience, I deeply realized that if a person only wants to repay kindness, they will not have revolutionary firmness. If this continues, they will gradually lose their revolutionary initiative and may even eventually leave the revolutionary ranks.

In 1964, the entire station launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. I began to seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works. I compared my pure desire to repay kindness with Chairman Mao's teachings and realized that our working class not only needs to carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction to the end in our country but also bears the heavy responsibility of supporting the world revolution and liberating all oppressed peoples around the world. Facing such a heavy responsibility, relying solely on the desire to repay kindness is not enough. If I continue to approach the current revolutionary cause with that pure desire to repay kindness, how can I not fall behind?

Especially through repeatedly studying the "Three Articles," the lofty revolutionary spirit of Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune greatly inspired me. Comparing myself to them, I felt even more that my desire to repay kindness was too narrow. I repeatedly thought: If Norman Bethune had come to China to help the Chinese people in their revolutionary struggle just to repay kindness, could he have traveled thousands of miles? No. Norman Bethune was able to be so selfless and dedicated to the people because he had a heart that was wholeheartedly for the revolution. Over the years, my thoughts gradually changed, my steps forward became smaller, and my vision became narrower, all because I lacked the word "revolution" in my heart.

My ideological understanding improved, my work purpose became clear, my work enthusiasm increased, and my ideological realm became broader.

With revolution in my heart, I naturally connected my work with the revolution. Although the switchman's work is ordinary, it is also an indispensable part of the revolutionary cause. Therefore, I love my switchman's work even more. Whether it's on duty or off duty, in snow or rain, I always keep the switches clean and bright; every time a train passes through the switches, I check them once, and if I find any problems, I deal with them immediately. I feel that only by doing this can I make my due contribution in our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in supporting the world revolutionary struggle, which is the revolutionary task given to me by the Party.

With revolution in my heart, my vision became broader, and my thoughts became more open. I felt that every revolutionary's work position is different, but the goal is the same—to serve the revolution. Whatever is beneficial to the revolution, no matter who it is, should be actively done, and done well. Therefore, in my work, I broke out of the small circle of just being a switchman. I often paid attention to the station's affairs and actively helped others with their work. Sometimes when others forgot their work, I would remind them.

With revolution in my heart, I no longer felt tired at work, whether on duty or off duty, I was always full of energy. I felt that although a person has on-duty and off-duty times, rest and busy times at work, in terms of doing the revolution, one should always be on duty and always be busy. Therefore, when I was on duty, I actively did my work well, and when I was off duty, I also went to the station to help maintain order, assist the elderly and children, help passengers with their luggage, and do my best to solve some difficulties.

With revolution in my heart, I became younger.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's soul is the only way to uproot selfish thoughts and firmly establish the public spirit.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation."

If a person wants to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly," they must arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, carry out a revolution in the depths of their soul, break down selfishness and establish the public spirit, do one day of revolution and transform one day of thought, do a lifetime of revolution and transform a lifetime of thought. Only in this way can selfish thoughts be uprooted, and the public spirit can be firmly established.

I gradually improved my understanding of transforming my thoughts through actual struggles. In the past, I always thought that I was an old worker, from a tenant farmer family, had never done anything wrong, had never made mistakes at work, and had boundless love for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I worked hard every day for the revolution, getting up early and staying up late. I thought that with these points, there was nothing else that needed to be transformed! When I heard someone say, "Everyone needs to transform their thoughts," I was unhappy from the bottom of my heart. Therefore, I usually did not talk about transforming thoughts and never thought about it. All day long, I only knew how to work, and the leadership told me to do something, and I did it. The Party had some calls, and I actively responded. When I saw something, as long as it was beneficial to the revolution, I actively did it. I thought that this way, I could do the revolution for a lifetime and walk the revolutionary path for a lifetime.

Was my thought really without any problems? Were my selfish thoughts completely eliminated, clean and tidy? Did I really not need to transform? No, it was just that I had not studied and applied Chairman Mao's works well, and my brain lacked this red line of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, although selfish thoughts had already emerged, I did not realize it and was not conscious of it.

In March 1963, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," which greatly inspired me. I read Lei Feng's deeds over and over again, and my tears flowed over and over again. Every time I read it, I received a profound education. I repeatedly thought: My background is the same as Lei Feng's, the suffering in the old society is the same, and the education and cultivation by the Party after liberation are the same. Why am I not as good as Lei Feng? After searching and searching, I found the most fundamental reason: I did not treat Chairman Mao's books like air, food, and a steering wheel like Lei Feng did; I did not carry out a revolution in the depths of my soul like Lei Feng did, and I did not use Mao Zedong Thought to transform myself and guide my actions.

From then on, I often studied Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Moving Mountains" and combined them with reality, learning and applying them bit by bit, learning one sentence and applying one sentence, using Chairman Mao's highest instructions to break down selfishness and establish the public spirit, to transform my worldview, and to launch a fierce attack on the "I."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "An foreigner, with no selfish motive, regards the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause. What kind of spirit is this? This is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism. Every member of the Communist Party of China should learn from this spirit." "We should all learn from his spirit of selflessness. From this point of view, one can become a person who is greatly beneficial to the people."

Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, I overthrew the "I," and the "public" was established. I felt that my eyes were brighter than before, the direction was clear, and my whole body felt a kind of indescribable lightness and happiness. This incident made me further realize that although I am an old worker with a good background, I not only need to transform but also must resolutely decide to transform my thoughts, so that I can truly follow the Party and Chairman Mao and do the revolution for a lifetime.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's soul is the only way to unite with comrades to revolutionize and advance together.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history."

Our revolutionary cause can only achieve one great victory after another under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao by uniting the broad masses of the people. Although an individual may have great abilities, compared to the broad masses, they are still very small and insignificant; only by uniting with everyone to revolutionize and advance together, merging one's strength into the broad masses, can one make contributions to the revolutionary work.

I have always been unwilling to let anyone say "no" to the work I am responsible for. When on duty, I always wanted to do things neatly and tidily, arrange the tools in order, and keep the surroundings of the switchman's room clean. When others handed over their duties, if they did it poorly, I would get angry if it did not meet my expectations. Once, I took over Li Cheng's shift and saw that the ashtray was not emptied, and in a fit of anger, I threw it into the gutter behind the switchman's room. Over time, this affected the unity among comrades and caused dissatisfaction among everyone. Someone even gave me a nickname, "Wu the Great Marshal." At first, I always thought that I was serious and responsible in my work and strict in my requirements for others, and there was nothing wrong with that. Once, an apprentice forgot to add oil to the signal lamp just before handing over his shift, and it was too late to get oil from the station. He was afraid that I would get angry when I took over the shift, so he filled the oil can with water. I took over the shift and saw that the signal lamp was polished bright and the "oil" was full, and I did not say anything and took over the shift. Soon, I went to the freight line to perform shunting operations. Just after finishing the work, the signal lamp went out. I was really puzzled. I poured out the "oil" in the oil can and saw a few oil droplets floating on top, and the rest was all water. This time, I was really angry and was ready to scold him severely. The next day at the shift handover meeting, before I could open my mouth, the apprentice took the initiative to check himself: "Yesterday evening, I forgot to get the lamp oil, and I was afraid that Teacher Wu would get angry if I did not add it, so I poured in water." When the apprentice said this, I was at a loss for words. This incident gave me a great lesson. I thought: I did not expect that my stubborn temper would have such a big impact. With this problem in mind, I repeatedly studied the "Three Articles."

Chairman Mao said: "We all come from the rivers and lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." Chairman Mao also said in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness and dedication is manifested in his extreme responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, I examined myself and realized that my attitude towards comrades could not be seen as just a bad temper. If I dug deeper, there was also an "I" here. Everything was based on my own will. If the handover was not done well, I did not actively and enthusiastically help my comrades but instead scolded, frowned, and got angry. This was not the manifestation of the "I"? If this continued, how could I not alienate the masses? According to Chairman Mao's teachings of the two "extremes," I was really far behind. After realizing my shortcomings, I actively looked for ways to correct them. In my work, I paid attention to strengthening the unity among comrades; during the handover, if there were things not done, I would actively do them, and if there were things not finished, I would continue to do them. Everyone saw that my attitude had changed, and the handover became more detailed and serious. Usually, everyone rushed to do the work, and it was no longer like before when everyone did their own thing.

From this incident, I realized: If I do not believe in everyone, everyone will naturally not believe in me, and the result is that the revolutionary cause suffers losses; if I believe in everyone, I will also gain everyone's trust, and the result is that unity is strengthened, and work shows a new situation.

Let me talk about how Li Cheng and I improved our unity. Li Cheng is a very cultured person. Every time I got angry, he would just smile and let it go. The more he treated me like this, the more uncomfortable I felt. With this problem in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's works.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other."

After repeatedly studying, I realized that the problem was mainly on my side. I always looked at Li Cheng with old eyes, thinking that he was "careless," "not quick," and "not careful," and I did not pay much attention to or think much about his background of suffering deeply from a young age, being tormented by the landlord, and being active and hardworking at work, and being one of the pioneers of our station. We were both from the same bitter roots in the old society, and we should care for, love, and help each other. Therefore, I took the initiative to talk to him. I said: "In the past, we were both sufferers, and today we have come together for the revolution. We are not only classmates but also should be close friends. In the past, I was wrong to get angry with you. In the future, you should help me more." My self-criticism moved him, and he also admitted his shortcomings at work and spoke his mind. From then on, Li Cheng and I strengthened our unity and formed a pair of mutual help and learning. Usually, we studied Chairman Mao's works together, talked about our family history, dug up our bitter roots, and denounced the evil old society, and we loved the new society even more, continuously strengthening our class feelings. Because our thoughts were consistent, we supported and helped each other in our work, without any distinction, and we rushed to do the work when we saw it. This incident made me realize that only by uniting everyone can we produce boundless power.

Lin Biao comrade instructs us: Mao Zedong Thought is the science of revolution, the truth of the proletariat tested by long-term revolutionary struggles, the most realistic Marxism-Leninism, and the unified action guideline for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire country. We must thoroughly implement Mao Zedong Thought throughout the Party, the army, and the people of the entire country, and use Mao Zedong Thought to unify our thoughts.

Lin Biao comrade calls on us: All comrades should make every effort to truly master and grasp Mao Zedong Thought.

I resolutely respond to Lin Biao comrade's call, determined to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and focus on the "application." Chairman Mao's books are the lifeblood of our working class, the lifeblood of our descendants for generations to come. Not only must I study and apply them well, but I must also organize my entire family to study and apply them well, achieving the thought revolutionization of the entire family. Last month, my wife and I led a few children to Jiangdun Commune Jiangdong Brigade to learn from their experience in setting up Mao Zedong Thought schools, and we were greatly inspired. We also learned from the experience of the commune members' entire family being red. After the study and visit, our confidence in turning our entire family into a Mao Zedong Thought school was strengthened. After returning, with the help of the Party branch, our entire family stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and held an opening ceremony, expressing our determination: Our entire family will resolutely read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, achieving thought revolutionization, and following Chairman Mao to do the revolution for a lifetime. From then on, our entire family studied three times a week, discussed twice, and held a family lecture meeting on the weekend. After such study, the selfish thoughts of the entire family decreased, my work enthusiasm increased, and the children all rushed to do good deeds outside.

I still need to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more, and our family's Mao Zedong Thought school has just begun, but we have made the greatest determination: Not only must we achieve everyone being red and the entire family being red, but we must also achieve generation after generation being red, passing down the great Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation, letting our descendants for generations forever read Chairman Mao's books, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and forever do the revolution.

    毛泽东思想哺育我成为一个真正的工人
    锦州铁路局励家车站扳道员　吴殿林
    我是一个铁路扳道工人。今年十月十日早晨七点十分，在万分紧急的关头，我冒生命危险，防止了一列运送红卫兵的特别快车和货物列车追尾的重大伤亡事故，保卫了上千名红卫兵的生命，保卫了国家财产，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命。
    这是我应该做的事情。我所以能够做出这样的事情来，是我活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，深挖私心，狠斗“我”字，大立“公”字，不断改造世界观的结果；是党对我不断培养教育的结果；也是周围群众对我耐心帮助的结果。
      没有共产党和毛主席，就没有我吴殿林的一切。毛泽东思想，是我们工人阶级的命根子。我最热爱毛主席，我最爱读毛主席的书。毛主席的书教育我成为一个真正的工人。
    用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，才能成为一个真正的彻底的革命者
    一个出身好，在旧社会苦大仇深的人，对党和毛主席无限热爱，满心眼想报答党和毛主席的恩情，这是很自然的。可是仔细想一下，这种单纯“报恩”的思想，是从“我”字出发的，不是真正的彻底的革命思想。一个人如果不树立起一心为革命的思想，革命热情就不会巩固，革命干劲就不会持久，就不会有远大的革命理想，就不能成为一个真正的彻底的革命者。
    在旧社会，我的仇深似海，一提起旧社会，我恨之入骨。
    解放了，共产党、毛主席把我从苦海火坑中救了出来。想想过去，比比现在，我对党和毛主席无比热爱，对今天的新社会无比热爱。这种纯朴的阶级感情，使我产生了强烈的报恩思想。
    解放不久，我就带着这种报恩思想，参加了人民铁路工作。由于对革命的目的还不十分明确，因此，革命很不自觉。起初，在车站工作，真是有多大劲使多大劲，领导叫干啥就干啥。后来，领导提拔我当了运转车长，更是起早贪黑，一个劲地干，从来不知道啥叫苦，啥叫累。但是，由报恩思想激发起来的革命热情，并不能持久。只是几年的时间，便感到运转车长贪黑起早，风里来雨里去，太辛苦，再加上身体不好，就请求领导将自己调到车站担任了扳道工作。
    从我的切身经历中，使我深深体会到，一个人单纯为了报恩，是不会有革命坚定性的，发展下去，会渐渐地丧失革命进取心，甚至最后脱离革命队伍。
    一九六四年，全站掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，我开始认真地活学活用毛主席著作。我把我的单纯报恩思想跟毛主席的教导一对号，我认识到，我们工人阶级不仅要把我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设进行到底，而且，还担负着支援世界革命，解放全世界被压迫人民的重大责任。面对这样的重大责任，光靠报恩思想是不行的，我还以那种单纯报恩思想来对待现在革命事业的要求，怎能不落后呢！
    特别是通过反复学习“老三篇”，张思德、白求恩高尚的革命精神，极大地鼓舞了我。跟他们一对比，越发感到自己的报恩思想太狭隘了。我反复地想：白求恩要是为了报恩，能不远万里来到中国，帮助中国人民进行革命斗争吗？不能。白求恩之所以能够那样毫不利己专门利人，就是由于他有一颗一心为革命的红心。几年来，我的思想所以渐渐变化，前进的步子迈得越来越小，眼睛看得越来越近，正是因为我心里缺少“革命”两字。
    思想认识提高了，干工作的目的明确了，工作起来劲头更足了，思想境界更开阔了。
    心中有了革命，就很自然地将自己担负的工作跟革命紧紧连在一起了。扳道工作虽然平凡，但它同样是革命事业所不可缺少的一部分。所以，我对扳道工作更加热爱了。不管当班还是休班，雪天还是雨天，我总是把道岔扫得干干净净，擦得亮亮堂堂；列车从道岔通过一次，我就检查一次，发现一点毛病，就马上处理。我觉得只有这样做，才能在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，在支援世界革命斗争中做出我应有的贡献，这也就是党给我的革命任务。
      心中有了革命，眼睛看得更远了，心里想得更开阔了。我觉得，每个革命者的工作岗位不同，但是目标是一个，都是为了革命。凡是对革命有利的事，不管是谁的，见到了都应该积极去做，而且还应该做好。所以，我在工作中跳出了仅限于扳道工作这个小圈子，车站的事，我经常关心，别人的工作，我主动帮助干，有时别人把工作忘了，我主动帮助记着。
      心中有了革命，工作不觉得累了，休班、忙班，都是一个劲。我觉得，一个人在工作上虽然有上班下班、休班忙班之分，但是就干革命来说，应该永远是上班，永远是忙班。所以，我当班时积极做好工作，休班时也总到车站上来，帮助维持站内秩序，扶老携幼，帮助旅客拿东西，尽力帮助解决些困难。
    心中有了革命，使我变得更年轻了。
    用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，才能把私心杂念斩草除根，公字才能越立越牢
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。
    一个人要想做到“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务，就必须用毛泽东思想武装自己，在灵魂深处闹革命，破私立公，干一天革命，改造一天思想，干一辈子革命，改造一辈子思想。这样，私心杂念才能斩草除根，公字才能越立越牢。
    我对改造自己的思想，是经过实际斗争，认识才逐步提高的。过去，我总觉得，自己是一个老工人，家庭出身雇农，又没干过坏事，在工作上没犯过错误，对共产党和毛主席，满心眼热爱，整天为革命起早贪黑，辛辛苦苦。就凭这几条，还有啥需要改造的！听到有人说：“改造思想，人人有份，人人需要”，我就从心眼里往外不高兴。所以，平素我根本不谈思想改造，也从来不往这上想。一天到晚，只知道干工作，领导让干啥就干啥，党有什么号召，我积极响应，见到什么事，只要对革命有利，我就积极去做。自己满以为这样，就可以干一辈子革命，走一辈子革命道路了。
    是不是我的思想真的一点毛病也没有呢？是不是我的私心杂念都清除得干干净净，利利索索了呢？真的不需要改造呢？不是的，只是因为我没有很好地活学活用毛主席著作，脑子里缺少毛泽东思想这条红线，所以私心杂念虽然已经冒了出来，自己还不以为然，还很不自觉。
    一九六三年三月，我们伟大的领袖毛主席发出“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召，使我受到了很大的鼓舞。雷锋的事迹，我读了一遍又一遍，我的热泪，也流了一次又一次。每读一遍，都使我受到一次深刻的教育。我反复想：我跟雷锋的出身一个样，在旧社会受的苦一个样，解放后受党的培养教育也一个样，可是我为什么不如雷锋呢？找来找去，找到了最根本的一条，就是没有像雷锋同志那样把毛主席的书当做空气、粮食和方向盘；没有像雷锋那样在自己灵魂深处闹革命，没有用毛泽东思想改造自己，指导自己的行动。
    从这以后，我就经常学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》三篇文章，结合实际，一点一点的学，一点一点的用，学一句，用一句，把毛主席的最高指示用到破私立公上，用到改造自己的世界观上，用到向“我”字猛烈开火上。
      毛主席教导我们说：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，每一个中国共产党员都要学习这种精神。”“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。”
    根据毛主席的教导，斗倒了“我”字，“公”字树立起来了。我觉得眼睛比过去更亮了，方向明了，全身感到有一种说不出来的轻松愉快。这件事使我进一步认识到，自己虽然是一个老工人，出身好，不仅同样需要改造，而且，还必须下定决心，狠狠地改造思想，这样，才能真正跟着党和毛主席干一辈子革命。
    用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，才能团结同志一道革命，一道前进
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    我们的革命事业，只有在党和毛主席的领导下，团结广大人民群众才能取得一个又一个的伟大胜利。一个人尽管有很大能力，但是与广大群众比起来，仍然是很渺小的，微不足道的；只有团结大家一道革命，将自己的力量溶化在广大群众之中，才能对革命工作作出贡献。
    我对自己担负的工作，多咱都不愿意让人说出个“不”字来。当班，总想把事情干得利利索索，把工具摆得顺顺当当，把扳道房周围收拾得干干净净。别人交班时，做得差一点，一看不符合自己的心意，我就来气。有一次我接励成的班，看到烟灰盒没倒净，一气之下，顺手就把它扔到扳道房后边的阴沟里去了。这样天长日久，影响了同志间的团结，引起大家的不满。有人还给我起了个外号，叫“吴大帅”。起初，总觉得自己对工作认真负责，对人严格要求，没有什么错。有一次，一个徒工临交班时，发现信号灯里的油忘添了，上站取油已经来不及，又怕我接班时发脾气，他就将信号灯的油壶加满了水。我一接班，看信号灯擦得崭亮，“油”也上得满满的，没说啥就接了班。随后，我到货物线进行调车作业，刚干完活，信号灯就灭了。我真有点纳闷。我把油壶里的“油”倒出来一看，只见上面飘着几颗油珠，下面全是水。这下可把我气坏了，准备狠狠说说他。第二天交班会上，还没等我张口，那个徒工就主动检查说：“昨天晚间交班忘了领灯油，不添又怕吴师傅发脾气，没有办法，才倒的水。”听徒工这么一说，我反而不好开口了。这件事给了我很大的教育。我想：想不到我的一股倔脾气，竟会造成这样大的影响。我带着这个问题反复学习了“老三篇”。
    毛主席说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”毛主席还在《纪念白求恩》一文中说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”按照毛主席的教导检查自己，我认识到自己对同志耍态度，不能只看成是脾气不好，深挖一挖，这里也有一个“我”字。一切都从自己的意愿出发，交班差一点，不是积极热情地帮助同志，而是摔打，皱眉毛，大发脾气，这不正是“我”字的表现吗？长此下去，怎能不脱离群众呢？按照毛主席教导的两个“极端”检查自己，我差得实在太远了。认识到了缺点，我就积极想法改正。在工作中注意加强同志之间的团结；在交接班时，发现没做的活我就主动去做，没做完的事我就接着去干。大家见我态度有了转变，交接班也就更加细致、认真了。平时有活大家抢着干，不像过去那样各干各的了。
    从这件事使我体会到：我不相信大家，大家自然也不会相信我，结果使革命事业受了损失；我相信了大家，也就得到了大家的信任，结果是团结加强了，工作出现了新气象。
    再说说我与励成是怎样搞好团结的吧。励成是个很有涵养的人，每当我发脾气时，他总是嘿嘿一笑了事。励成越是这样对待我，我就越觉得心里不是滋味。带着这个问题，我学习了毛主席著作。
    毛主席教导我们说：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”
    经过反复学习，我认识到，毛病主要在我这边。我对励成总是用老眼光看他，认为他“干活粗拉”、“不利索”、“不细心”，而对他出身很苦，从小受尽地主的折磨，工作积极肯干，是我们站上的一名闯将，就看得不多，想得不多。我与励成在旧社会都是一个苦根上的瓜，我们应该相互关心，相互爱护，相互帮助。于是，我就主动跟他谈心。我说：“过去咱们都是受苦人，今天走到一起来了，都是为了革命。我们不但阶级亲，人也要亲。过去我对你发脾气太不对了，今后你要多帮助我。”我的检查使他很受感动，他也承认了自己在工作上的缺点，说出了心里话。从此，我跟励成增强了团结，并结了互帮互学的对子。平时，我们一起学习毛主席著作，谈家史，挖苦根，控诉万恶的旧社会，更加热爱新社会，不断增强阶级感情。由于思想一致了，在工作上也互相支持，互相帮助，不分彼此，见活就抢着干。这件事使我体会到，只有把大家团结起来，才会产生无穷无尽的力量。
                      ×　　×　　×
    林彪同志指示我们：毛泽东思想是革命的科学，是经过长期革命斗争考验的无产阶级的真理，是最现实的马克思列宁主义，是全党全军全国人民的统一的行动纲领。必须彻底把毛泽东思想贯彻于全党全军全国人民，用毛泽东思想来统一我们的思想。
    林彪同志号召我们：全体同志都应当尽最大的努力，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来。
    我坚决响应林彪同志的号召，决心活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，不断斗倒“我”字。毛主席的书，是我们工人阶级的命根子，是我们子孙万代的命根子，不仅我要学好、用好，也要组织我全家人学好、用好，实现全家思想革命化。上个月，我同爱人领着几个孩子，到姜屯公社姜东大队学习他们办毛泽东思想大学校的经验，很受启发。我们还学习了社员们全家红的经验。经过学习访问，增强了把我们全家办成毛泽东思想大学校的信心。回来后，在党支部的帮助下，我们全家人站在毛主席像前，举行了开学典礼，表示了决心：我们全家坚决读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，实现思想革命化，跟毛主席干一辈子革命。从此，我们全家每周学习三次，讨论二次，周末还开一次全家的讲用会。这么一学，一家人的私心杂念少了，我的工作干劲更足了，孩子们都争着到外边做好事。
    我活学活用毛主席著作还很不够，全家的毛泽东思想大学校还只是刚刚开始，但我们已经下定最大决心，不但要做到人人红，全家红，还要做到辈辈红，把毛泽东思想大学校世世代代办下去，把战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想代代传下去，让我们的子孙万代，永远读毛主席的书，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远干革命。　（新华社稿，本报作了删节）
