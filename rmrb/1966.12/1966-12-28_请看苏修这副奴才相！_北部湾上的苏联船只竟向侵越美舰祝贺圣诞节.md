Look at the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists!
Soviet ships in the Gulf of Tonkin actually send Christmas greetings to U.S. warships invading Vietnam

New China News Agency, December 27th

Just as the U.S. aggressors, under the cover of "peace talks," are escalating their war of aggression against Vietnam, Soviet ships in the Gulf of Tonkin near the Vietnamese coast have actually sent a "Christmas telegram" to the U.S. warships invading Vietnam, expressing their "best wishes" to the American butchers who are slaughtering the Vietnamese people. This once again exposes the true colors of the Soviet modern revisionists as accomplices of U.S. imperialism.

According to a report by the Associated Press on the 26th from Saigon, the U.S. Navy announced on the 26th that a U.S. warship operating in the waters off northern Vietnam sent a "Christmas telegram" to a Soviet ship. The Soviet ship immediately sent back a telegram to the U.S. warship. The text of the telegram was as follows: "Wishing you a Merry Christmas and the best wishes for 1967. May 1967 be a year of peace. Wish you good luck."

This telegram once again shows that the Soviet modern revisionists, who are obsessed with "U.S.-Soviet cooperation," are always flattered and flirting with the American imperialist murderers who pat them on the shoulder. In front of the Vietnamese people and all the people of the world, they fully expose their traitorous and servile nature.

    请看苏修这副奴才相！
    北部湾上的苏联船只竟向侵越美舰祝贺圣诞节
    新华社二十七日讯正当美国侵略者在“和谈”的烟幕下把侵略越南的战争不断“升级”的时候，在北部湾越南沿海附近的苏联船只竟然向北部湾上的侵略越南的美国军舰发出“圣诞贺电”，向屠杀越南人民的美国强盗致“最好的祝愿”。这再一次暴露了苏联现代修正主义者充当美帝国主义的帮凶的面目。据美联社二十六日从西贡报道，侵越美国海军二十六日宣布，在越南北方沿海一带进行活动的一艘美国军舰，向一艘苏联船发了“圣诞贺电”之后，这艘苏联船立即给这艘美国军舰发回贺电。这封贺电的电文如下：“祝圣诞节愉快，致一九六七年的最好的祝愿，祝一九六七年成为和平年。祝你们幸运。”这种贺电再一次表明，醉心于“美苏合作”的苏联现代修正主义者，对于拍拍他们肩膀的美帝国主义杀人犯，总是受宠若惊，频送秋波，在越南人民和全世界人民面前，充分暴露出一副叛徒、奴才相。
