A new high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution is surging in industrial and mining enterprises across the country. The working class of our country is the leading force and the most active element in the cultural revolution. They bear a particularly heavy responsibility for this cultural revolution. It is a historical trend and a good thing for millions of workers to rise up and carry out the cultural revolution, and it is something that no force can stop.

The question of which path our industrial and mining enterprises should take is of extreme importance to the success or failure of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Should they advance along the socialist path as pointed out by Chairman Mao? Or should they slide down the capitalist and revisionist path?

Over the past seventeen years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, and through the hard work of the broad masses of workers, our industrial and mining enterprises have achieved great successes. However, it must be noted that many of our enterprises, in terms of political ideology, organizational leadership, and production management, have been seriously influenced by capitalism, revisionism, and even feudalism to varying degrees. These influences not only shackle the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers and hinder the development of productive forces but also breed the seeds of revisionism and become the breeding ground for a capitalist restoration. In some enterprises, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in collusion with class enemies, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, unrepentant bourgeois elements, and degenerate elements who have infiltrated the ranks of the workers, stubbornly resist Chairman Mao's correct line, vigorously promote a revisionist line, and attempt to lead socialist enterprises down the capitalist road. If we do not resolutely overthrow these capitalist-roaders within the Party, thoroughly eliminate the pernicious influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, and uproot the revisionist roots, we will inevitably undermine our country's socialist economic foundation, obstruct the consolidation of our country's socialist public ownership and proletarian dictatorship, and risk a change in color.

From this, it can be seen that carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution in industrial and mining enterprises is not a matter of whether to do it or not, or whether it is important or not, but a matter of necessity and of doing it thoroughly.

Chairman Mao has always taught us, "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Chairman Mao's policy of combining revolution with production means putting revolution in the first place, using revolution to guide production, and promoting production. Our methods for developing production are completely different from those of imperialism and modern revisionism. We do not rely on coercion or material incentives but on the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, political and ideological work, and the ideological transformation of the people. When people's political and ideological outlook changes, spiritual strength will be transformed into tremendous material force.

Who understands the significance of combining revolution with production the best? It is first and foremost the workers who have personally participated in revolutionary and productive practice. Some worker comrades see that the lid of class struggle in the factory has not been lifted, that workers advocating cultural revolution are suppressed, and they feel very indignant and anxious; they see that because the revolution cannot be carried out, production is affected, and they feel very painful. They have a strong sense of political responsibility towards our great socialist motherland. Now, they are resolutely carrying out the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, actively participating in the proletarian cultural revolution on the one hand, and firmly holding their posts in production and construction on the other, adhering to the eight-hour workday, striving to complete and overfulfill production plans, and striving for high-quality products. They can thus achieve double victories in cultural revolution and production.

Carrying out the proletarian cultural revolution within industrial and mining enterprises will inevitably involve serious struggles. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few die-hard defenders of the bourgeois reactionary line will use the pretext of promoting production to suppress the revolution. They are not afraid of failing to complete production plans but are afraid of the masses overthrowing them. Some workers have said, "They are afraid of the masses, afraid of the revolution, afraid of being removed from office, but not afraid of failing to complete production plans." This is a penetrating criticism.

When the revolutionary masses resolutely struggle against these capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few die-hard defenders of the bourgeois reactionary line, they will use every possible means to resist fiercely. They regard themselves as the "embodiment of the Party," and anyone who opposes them is labeled as "anti-Party." They also threaten with "settling accounts later." They use the recruitment of Party and Youth League members and material benefits as bait to deceive and mislead some people to act as their bodyguards. They even operate behind the scenes, instigate workers to fight workers, instigate workers to fight students, create incidents, incite armed struggles, disrupt production, and sabotage the cultural revolution. The working class must remain highly vigilant and smash their plots.

The Party Central Committee has stipulated that during the proletarian cultural revolution, no leader of any industrial and mining enterprise may retaliate against workers for criticizing them or exposing facts, deduct their wages, or dismiss them. Temporary and contract workers must not be dismissed for participating in the cultural revolution. Those who have been labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" during the cultural revolution must be exonerated. Leaders must not be transferred from their original production positions, and their family members must not be threatened or persecuted. Workers who have been forced to leave the factory due to persecution must be allowed to return to participate in production and the cultural revolution. Wages of workers who were forced to leave the factory should be paid in full. We must resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's stipulations to ensure that the cultural revolution in industrial and mining enterprises can proceed normally and healthily.

The working class must resolutely follow the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the proletarian cultural revolution and elect cultural revolution small groups, cultural revolution committees, or cultural revolution representative assemblies from among the masses to represent themselves. The production of these representative organizations cannot be appointed from above, manipulated from behind, but must be elected by the masses according to the principles of the Paris Commune, through full discussion and repeated elections by the masses, and can be changed or replaced at any time.

The working masses have the right to establish various revolutionary organizations during the proletarian cultural revolution. All worker organizations must maintain the hardworking and simple character of the working class and not establish bureaucratic institutions and material equipment that are detached from the masses. Generally, the staff of worker organizations should not be separated from production.

Workers and worker organizations must strengthen unity on the basis of great Mao Zedong Thought and in the context of a unified revolutionary direction. They must not be used by bad elements or create a situation of confrontation. They must insist on ideological struggle, not armed struggle, and not resort to violence. Differences in views and opinions should be resolved through democratic discussion, presenting facts and reasoning, and seeking consensus through consultation. On major issues, consensus should be sought, while on minor issues, differences can be tolerated.

We must be steadfast revolutionaries, resolutely implement the Party's class line and policies, continuously consolidate and strengthen the revolutionary leftist forces, unite the majority, and form a mighty army of proletarian cultural revolutionaries to maximize the isolation of the enemy.

The combination of revolutionary intellectuals and workers and peasants is an important guarantee for the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. The working class should welcome revolutionary students to come to the factories for exchanges, and revolutionary students should also welcome workers from their own city to go to the schools for exchanges, so that they can learn from each other, help each other, support each other, and promote each other.

Comrades, workers across the country, as long as we are good at learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, mastering Mao Zedong Thought as an invincible ideological weapon, although there will be difficulties and twists and turns on our way forward, we will definitely be able to ride the wind and break the waves, from victory to victory, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

### 迎接工矿企业文化大革命的高潮

    迎接工矿企业文化大革命的高潮
    现在，一个无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮，正在全国工矿企业中兴起。我国工人阶级是文化大革命的领导力量和最积极的因素。他们对于这场文化大革命负有特别重大的责任。千百万工人群众起来进行文化大革命，是大势所趋，好得很，是任何力量都不能阻挡的。
    我们的工矿企业，究竟走什么道路？是按照毛主席指出的社会主义的道路前进呢？还是沿着资本主义、修正主义的道路滑下去？这是关系到我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设成败的极端重大的问题。
    十七年来，我们的工矿企业，在以毛主席为首的党中央的正确领导下，经过广大工人群众的辛勤劳动，取得了伟大的成就。但是，应当看到，我们有很多工矿企业，无论在政治思想上，组织领导上，生产管理上，都不同程度地受到资本主义、修正主义、甚至封建主义的严重影响。这些东西，不仅束缚工人群众的革命积极性，阻碍着生产力的发展，而且繁殖修正主义的种子，成为资本主义复辟的温床。在有些工矿企业中，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，和混进职工队伍里的地富反坏分子、没有改造好的资产阶级分子、蜕化变质分子勾结起来，顽固地对抗毛主席的正确路线，极力推行修正主义的一套，妄图把社会主义的企业引上资本主义的道路。如果我们不坚决打倒那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的恶劣影响，挖掉修正主义根子，那就必然会破坏我国社会主义的经济基础，妨碍我国社会主义所有制和无产阶级政权的巩固，使我国有改变颜色的危险。
    由此可见，在工矿企业里开展无产阶级文化大革命，不是可有可无，无足轻重，而是非搞不可，非大搞特搞不可。
    毛主席历来教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”毛主席关于抓革命、促生产的方针，就是把革命放在第一位，用革命统帅生产，带动生产。我们发展生产的办法，同帝国主义和现代修正主义是完全不同的。我们一不靠强制，二不靠物质刺激，而是靠毛泽东思想挂帅，靠政治思想工作，靠人的思想革命化。人们的政治思想面貌改变了，精神的力量就会转化为巨大的物质力量。
    谁最能理解抓革命、促生产的意义呢？首先是那些亲自参加革命和生产实践的工人群众。有些工人同志，看到工厂里阶级斗争的盖子没有揭开，工人闹文化革命受到压制，感到非常愤慨，非常焦急；看到因为革命搞不起来，而使生产受到影响，又非常心痛。他们对于伟大的社会主义祖国，有高度的政治责任感。现在，他们坚决执行党中央和毛主席的指示，一方面积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，一方面坚守生产和建设的岗位，坚持八小时工作制，努力完成和超额完成生产计划，并且力争产品的高质量。他们这样做，完全可以夺取文化革命和生产的双胜利。
    在工矿企业内进行无产阶级文化大革命，是要经过严重斗争的。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，他们口口声声也讲抓生产，其实，他们是借口抓生产来压革命，抓生产是假的，压革命是真的。这些人不是害怕搞不好生产，而是害怕群众革他们的命。有的工人说：“他们怕群众，怕革命，怕罢官，就是不怕完不成生产计划。”这真是一针见血的批评。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，当革命群众向他们作坚决斗争的时候，总是千方百计地进行疯狂的抵抗。他们俨然以“党的化身”自居，谁要反对他们，就说谁“反党”，并且以“秋后算账”相威胁。他们还以“发展党团员”和物质利益作为诱饵，欺骗和蒙蔽一些人，为自己保镖。他们甚至在幕后操纵，挑动工人斗工人，挑动工人斗学生，制造事件，煽动武斗，破坏生产，破坏文化革命。我们工人阶级一定要保持高度的警惕，粉碎他们的阴谋诡计。
    党中央规定，在无产阶级文化大革命中，任何工矿企业的领导人，都不能因为群众提出批评，揭露事实，而实行打击报复，不准因此克扣工资，开除工人，也不准因此而解雇合同工和临时工。在文化大革命中，凡是把革命群众打成“反革命”的，必须一律平反。不许调动原来的生产位子，不许对工人家属进行威胁迫害。受到打击而被迫离开工厂的革命工人，必须允许他们回厂参加生产，参加文化革命。革命工人被迫离厂时的工资应该照发。我们一定要坚决执行党中央的规定，保证工矿企业的文化大革命能够正常地健康地进行。
    工人阶级应当坚决按照中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，由群众选出能够代表自己的文化革命小组、文化革命委员会或文化革命代表会议。这些组织代表的产生，不能由上面指定，不能背后操纵，而必须按照巴黎公社的原则，实行全面的选举制，经过群众充分酝酿，反复讨论，认真选举，并且可以随时改选和撤换。
    工人群众在无产阶级文化大革命中，有建立各种革命组织的权利。一切工人组织，都应当保持工人阶级勤劳朴素的本色，不要搞一套脱离群众的官僚主义机构和物质装备。工人组织中的工作人员，一般都不要脱离生产。
    工人群众之间，工人组织之间，一定要在伟大的毛泽东思想的基础上，在革命大方向一致的前提下，加强团结，不要被坏人利用，不要造成对抗的形势。要坚持文斗，不用武斗，不要动手打人。对一些问题有不同的看法、不同的意见，应当以革命利益为重，以大局为重，通过摆事实、讲道理的方法，进行民主讨论，求得协商解决。在原则问题上应当求同，在枝节问题上可以存异。
    我们一定要做坚定的无产阶级革命派，坚决执行党的阶级路线和党的政策，不断地巩固和壮大革命左派的队伍，团结大多数，组成一支浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，以便最大限度地孤立敌人。
    革命的知识分子和工农群众相结合，是使无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的重要保证。我们工人阶级应当欢迎革命学生到工厂来串连，革命学生也应当欢迎本市的工人到学校去串连，以便相互学习，相互帮助，相互支持，相互促进。
    全国广大工人同志们，只要我们善于在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的强大思想武器，尽管我们前进道路上会有困难，会有曲折，我们也一定能够乘风破浪，从胜利走向胜利，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
