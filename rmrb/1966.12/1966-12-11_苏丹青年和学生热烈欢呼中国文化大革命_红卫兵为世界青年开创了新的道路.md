Many Sudanese youth and students have warmly hailed the revolutionary actions of China's Red Guards in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A youth named Bakri Ali wrote in a letter, "We firmly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great Chairman Mao Zedong, the teacher of the world's revolutionary people. We also unreservedly support the glorious revolutionary activities of the heroic Red Guards, who are the vanguard and pioneers of this revolution."

He said, "The Great Revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong's thought is actually a fatal blow to both old and new colonialism and their accomplices, the modern revisionists. Therefore, U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership, which colludes with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries, are trembling with fear. The Soviet revisionist leaders dare not carry out such a revolution in their own country or organize Red Guards; instead, they attack China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards. However, their plots will never succeed because the great Chinese people, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, have the support of the world's revolutionary people, who make up 90 percent of the world's population."

A student from Khartoum Middle School wrote to the Chinese Red Guards, "The Red Guards are a powerful force armed with the thoughts of the great teacher and leader Chairman Mao Zedong. The actions of the Red Guards are excellent." He said, "As soon as I heard the name Red Guards and read about your deeds, I was very happy, and my heart almost jumped out. I always cherish boundless love for you in my heart."

He continued, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the actions of the Red Guards have made the imperialists and revisionists tremble with fear. Therefore, they fabricate facts to deceive the people. But we do not believe these lies because we fully understand that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great achievement in China's socialist revolution and also a great achievement in the international communist movement."

A student from Khartoum University published an article in the latest issue of the university's wall newspaper, saying that the creative actions of the Chinese Red Guards have dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary forces in China and other parts of the world, as well as to the modern revisionists. Because the Red Guards "have dashed the hopes of the imperialists and modern revisionists to infiltrate their influence into China and sabotage China's construction."

A student from Khartoum Technical Institute told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "All revolutionary people in the world admire and love the Chinese Red Guards. Because under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought—the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—the Red Guards are full of revolutionary spirit in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and have opened up new paths for the youth of the world."

He said, "The world imperialists and their accomplices—the modern revisionists—have taken a shameful attitude towards this cultural revolution. This is their consistent attitude towards the Chinese people and all revolutionary people around the world who are fighting for freedom, democracy, and socialism."

    苏丹青年和学生热烈欢呼中国文化大革命
    红卫兵为世界青年开创了新的道路
    新华社喀土穆八日电　许多苏丹青年和学生热烈欢呼中国红卫兵在无产阶级文化大革命中的革命行动。
    一位名叫巴克里·阿里的青年在一封信中热情地说：“我们坚决支持伟大的毛泽东主席——全世界革命人民的导师——领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。我们也毫无保留地支持英勇的红卫兵的一切光辉的革命活动，他们是这场革命中的闯将和先锋。”
    他说：“毛主席思想指导下的这场大革命实际上是对新老殖民主义及其帮凶现代修正主义的致命打击，因此，美帝国主义以及同美帝国主义和反动派勾结的苏联修正主义领导集团吓得发抖。苏联修正主义领导人不敢在他们国内进行这样的革命和组织红卫兵，反而攻击中国的无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵……但是他们的阴谋决不会实现，因为在伟大的领袖毛泽东主席领导下的伟大的中国人民得到占全世界人口百分之九十的世界革命人民的支持。”
    喀土穆中学的一位学生写信给中国红卫兵说：“红卫兵是用伟大导师和伟大领袖毛泽东主席的思想武装起来的一支强大的力量。红卫兵的行动好得很。”他说：“我一听到红卫兵这个名称和读到关于你们的事迹，就十分高兴，我的心几乎快跳了出来。我的心中始终怀着对你们无限热爱的感情。”
    他接着说：“无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵的行动，使帝国主义者和修正主义者吓得发抖。因此，他们捏造事实，来愚弄人民。”“但是，我们不相信这些谎言，因为我们完全懂得，无产阶级文化大革命既是中国社会主义革命中的伟大创举，也是国际共产主义运动中的伟大创举。”
    喀土穆大学一位学生在这所大学最近一期的墙报上发表文章说，中国红卫兵的创造性行动，给了中国和世界其他地方的反动势力以及现代修正主义者沉重的打击。因为红卫兵“使帝国主义者及现代修正主义者企图把他们的影响渗透到中国并破坏中国建设的任何希望都破灭了”。
    喀土穆技术学院的一位学生对新华社记者说，全世界一切革命的人民，都钦佩和热爱中国红卫兵。因为红卫兵在毛泽东思想——当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——的指导下，在无产阶级文化大革命中充满了革命干劲，并为世界青年开创了新的道路。
    他说：“世界帝国主义及其合作者——现代修正主义对这场文化大革命采取了可耻的态度。这是他们对中国人民以及全世界为自由、民主和社会主义而斗争的一切革命人民采取的一贯态度。”
