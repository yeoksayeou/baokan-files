These are the forty-one overseas Chinese youth heroes who, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fought bravely against the Indonesian reactionaries and returned home triumphantly. These young people were unlawfully arrested and tortured by the Indonesian army authorities in Medan. They remained unyielding and fought tenaciously against the Indonesian reactionaries for forty days. Their deeds serve as a shining example for overseas Chinese.

    这是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同印尼反动派进行英勇斗争胜利归国的四十一名华侨小英雄。这些青少年曾被印尼棉兰陆军当局无理逮捕，严刑拷打。他们威武不屈，同印尼反动派进行了四十天英勇顽强的斗争。他们的事迹，是海外华侨的光辉榜样。
