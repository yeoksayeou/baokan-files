There are two attitudes towards difficulties. One is to stand up and fight through them. The more difficulties there are, the more one should forge ahead, turning difficulties into a driving force. Overcoming a difficulty is a victory. Such comrades are good comrades. The other attitude is to be overwhelmed by difficulties, becoming pessimistic and hopeless, seeing only the difficult side and not the favorable conditions. They do not believe in the Party, the masses, or collective economy, and have no enthusiasm for work.

				Jiao Yulu

A true revolutionary must be prepared to face all hardships and overcome all obstacles in the struggle. They must not fear difficulties and must stand firm in the face of all kinds of storms, even if a typhoon of the twelfth level comes, they must stand firm and advance steadfastly.

					Wang Jie

I will definitely not fear storms and waves, stand in front of the enemy, and fight to the end. A soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought is tough, like true gold that fears no fire.

					Cai Yongxiang

We are Chairman Mao's petroleum workers. For the motherland, we search for gas and oil. As soon as the order is given, we will set off, to the ends of the earth, to the corners of the sea, without a wrinkle on our brows or a tremor in our legs.

					Workers of the 32111 Drilling Team

Use Mao Zedong Thought to constantly transform one's own thinking, discard the "I," and revolutionize without fearing difficulties or dangers. When there are difficulties and dangers, you will dare to charge forward and fight against them.

    学用警句
    对待困难有两种态度，一种是站起来，斗争过去，越是困难越往前闯，把困难当成前进的动力，克服一个困难，就是一个胜利。这样的同志才是好同志。另一种是困难压头，悲观失望，只看到困难的一面，看不到有利条件的一面，他们不相信党，不相信群众，不相信集体经济，干起工作来没有劲头。
              焦裕禄
    真正的革命者，就要准备在斗争的过程中迎接万难，排除万难，不怕困难，经受住各种各样的风浪的考验，那怕是刮起十二级台风来，也要站稳脚跟，坚定不移的前进。
                      王杰
    我一定不怕大风大浪，站在敌人面前，和他战斗到底。用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士就是过硬，真金不怕火来炼。
                    蔡永祥
    我们是毛主席的石油工人，为祖国找气找油，只要一声令下，我们拔腿就走，走到天涯，走到海角，眉不打结，腿不发抖。
      三二一一一钻井队工人
    用毛泽东思想不断地来改造自己的思想，丢掉“我”字，干革命就不怕困难，不怕危险；有了困难有了危险，你才能敢于冲上去和它作斗争。
                      王裕昌
