As early as ninety years ago, Engels pointed out that "life is the mode of existence of proteins," and predicted that one day people would be able to artificially create proteins. Now, Chinese scientists, after six years and nine months of arduous work, have for the first time in the world used artificial methods to synthesize a biologically active protein—crystalline insulin.

Engels' brilliant foresight has first been scientifically proven in socialist China, under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a vivid manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system and a brilliant victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The origin of life has always been a fiercely debated issue between materialism and idealism. Materialism holds that life is the result of the billions of years of motion, evolution, and development of lifeless inorganic matter, while idealism attributes life to "divine creation." The "mystery of life" has been the most stubborn stronghold of idealism. The success of artificial insulin synthesis once again declares the bankruptcy of idealism and once again demonstrates the immense power of dialectical materialism.

The development of natural science is filled with struggles between materialism and idealism and between dialectics and metaphysics, from the macrocosm to the microcosm, from celestial bodies to elementary particles, all have their own laws of contradictory motion.

Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the most powerful ideological weapon for the proletariat to transform nature and society. Mastering Mao Zedong Thought enables one to understand objective laws, explore the mysteries of nature, and promote the development of natural science.

The artificial synthesis of insulin was once ridiculed by domestic and foreign bourgeois "experts" and "scholars" as a "risky" and "futile" endeavor, described as a "distant" prospect. However, Chinese scientists armed with Mao Zedong Thought dared to break free from the religious prejudices of the exploiting classes, dared to shatter the shackles of metaphysics and idealism, did not blindly follow old documents and literature, were not bound by old frameworks, dared to experiment and innovate, and thus broke into the "forbidden palace" of scientific research.

Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Matter can turn into spirit, and spirit can turn into matter." This is a great truth of dialectical materialism. This truth not only serves the interests of the proletariat but also conforms to the laws of development of nature and society. More and more scientific and technological personnel are recognizing this great truth through practice, consciously undergoing profound transformations in their worldviews, and thus achieving one outstanding achievement after another in the field of science and technology in our country.

Comrade Mao Zedong said as early as 1957: "If in the next few five-year plans, a considerable number of our intellectuals can accept Marxism, if a considerable number of people can, through work and life practice, through the practice of class struggle, production, and science, understand more Marxism, that would be good. This is our hope."

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have opened the door to the "mystery of life" and taken a significant step forward in exploring the mysteries of nature. As long as our broad masses of scientific workers study and apply Chairman Mao's works more effectively, master the powerful ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought for transforming the subjective and objective worlds, we will certainly be able to unravel more mysteries of nature and tap into boundless natural resources in our march towards nature. In this way, in the struggle to catch up with the advanced level of world science and technology, in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, our scientific workers can make even greater contributions.

### 用毛泽东思想打开“生命之谜”的大门

    用毛泽东思想打开“生命之谜”的大门
    早在九十年前，恩格斯就指出，“生命是蛋白体的存在方式”，并且预言，人们有一天能用人工制造蛋白体。现在，我国科学工作者，经过六年零九个月的艰苦工作，在世界上第一次用人工方法合成了一种具有生物活力的蛋白质——结晶胰岛素。
    恩格斯的天才预见，首先在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的社会主义中国，得到了科学的证明。这是社会主义制度优越性的生动体现，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。
    关于生命的起源，从来是唯物主义和唯心主义激烈争论的问题。唯物主义认为，生命是没有生命的无机物经过亿万年的运动、演化、发展的结果，而唯心主义却把生命说成是“神创造的”。“生命之谜”，成了唯心主义踞守的最顽固的一个堡垒。人工合成胰岛素的成功，又一次宣告了唯心主义的破产，又一次显示了辩证唯物主义的无比威力。
    自然科学的发展，每前进一步，都充满着唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争，充满着辩证法和形而上学的斗争。大至宏观世界，小至微观世界，从宇宙天体到基本粒子，都有着自己矛盾运动的规律。
    毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级手中改造自然、改造社会的最强大的思想武器。掌握了毛泽东思想，就能认识客观规律，探索自然界的奥秘，推动自然科学的发展。
    用人工方法合成胰岛素，曾经被那些国内外资产阶级的“专家”、“学者”讥讽为“冒险”，“痴心妄想”，说成是“遥远的”事情。可是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国科学工作者，敢于摆脱剥削阶级的宗教偏见，敢于冲破形而上学、唯心主义的羁绊，不迷信旧的文献资料，不受老框框的束缚，大胆试验，大胆创造，终于闯进了科学研究的“禁宫”。
    毛泽东同志说，物质可以变精神，精神可以变物质。这是一个伟大的唯物辩证法真理。这个真理，既符合无产阶级的利益，又符合自然、社会的发展规律。越来越多的科学技术人员，从实践中认识到这个伟大的真理，自觉地进行世界观的深刻改造，因而在我国科学技术领域中取得了一个又一个的杰出成就。
    毛泽东同志在一九五七年就说过：“如果在今后几个五年计划的时间内，在我们的知识分子中间能够有比较多的人接受马克思主义，能够有比较多的人通过工作和生活的实践，通过阶级斗争的实践、生产的实践、科学的实践，懂得比较多的马克思主义，这样就好了。这是我们的希望。”
    在毛泽东思想的指导下，我们打开了“生命之谜”的大门，在探索自然界奥妙的长途中，跨出了重大的一步。广大的科学工作者，只要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想这个改造主观世界和改造客观世界的强大思想武器，在向大自然的进军中，我们一定能够解开更多的自然之谜，挖掘出无穷的自然财富。这样，在赶超世界科学技术先进水平的斗争中，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，我们的科学工作者就可以做出更多更大的贡献了。
