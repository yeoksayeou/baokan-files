A friend from Africa, after visiting the Peasant Movement Training Institute in Guangzhou, took out a book titled "Socialist Thought in Africa." He angrily told his Chinese comrades, "Look at this book, it says 'Africa must become strong by relying on foreign aid.' This is complete nonsense." Then he picked up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and turned to the section on self-reliance and hard struggle, saying, "Chairman Mao's teachings are: 'Our policy should be based on what? It should be based on our own strength.'" He continued, "This is the most powerful weapon we have in our struggle against imperialism."

    最有力的武器
    一位非洲朋友在广州参观了农民运动讲习所之后，拿出一本叫什么《非洲的社会主义思想》的书，愤怒地对中国同志说：“你看，这本书上说什么‘非洲要强盛必须靠外国的援助’，这完全是胡说八道。”然后他拿起《毛主席语录》翻到自力更生，艰苦奋斗一节说：“毛主席的教导是：‘我们的方针要放在什么基点上？放在自己力量的基点上。’”接着他说：“这是我们同帝国主义作斗争的最有力的武器。”
