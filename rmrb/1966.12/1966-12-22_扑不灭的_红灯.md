The process of our theater rehearsing the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Red Lantern" is a process of struggle between two literary lines. It is a process of Chairman Mao's literary line defeating the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line.

Comrade Jiang Qing has shown great concern for the creation of the Beijing opera "The Red Lantern." From the selection of the script to the writing, performance, music, singing, and stage design, she conducted investigations and research and provided personal guidance, offering extremely valuable opinions. However, these opinions were maliciously altered by counter-revolutionary revisionists such as Zhou Yang and Lin Mohan. They did not faithfully convey Jiang Qing's opinions to the masses. A small clique of those in power within our theater who are taking the capitalist road collaborated with Zhou Yang and Lin Mohan, obstructing the revolution of Beijing opera. During the production of "The Red Lantern," we experienced a sharp and complex struggle.

The third scene, "The Soup Kitchen," is a very important part of the play. Comrade Jiang Qing pointed out that this scene should depict Li Yuhe's close relationship with the masses and the social background of the time. It should further use actions to praise Li Yuhe's unyielding, wise, and brave proletarian heroism in the face of the enemy, highlighting the excellent qualities of a Communist Party member. However, they used deceitful and hypocritical methods to remove this scene. Only after Comrade Jiang Qing insisted repeatedly did they reluctantly add it back. Comrade Jiang Qing also pointed out that the play should highlight the heroic characters and that the portrayal and handling of the villainous characters should give way to the worker-peasant-soldier heroes, not sharing the stage equally, and not letting the villain steal the show. However, these people would not listen and insisted on sharing the stage equally, focusing on portraying the villainous characters to attract the audience, saying things like, "If there's a play, you have to grab the audience's attention, each finding their own tricks."

Regarding the "Struggle at the Execution Ground" scene, Comrade Jiang Qing pointed out several times: In this scene, Li Yuhe should sing a lot. A complete and perfect singing style should be used to fully express Li Yuhe's revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism, showing his concern for the country and his vision for the world. It should have a musical image, further depicting Li Yuhe's unyielding Communist Party member qualities of being fearless in the face of danger while in prison, looking towards the world revolution. This is a key scene in establishing a tall image of worker-peasant-soldier heroes. However, a small clique of bourgeois "authorities," driven by their class sentiments, said things like: Li Yuhe singing too much in this scene is not appropriate, especially singing a complete singing style, which will definitely "sing to death" the audience! They emphasized the cruelty of the struggle, using torture and bourgeois sentimentalism to "stimulate" the audience, thus distorting the heroic images of three generations and damaging the revolutionary theme of "The Red Lantern."

Comrade Jiang Qing also pointed out: In this scene, when Li Yuhe is walking to the execution ground, the "Internationale" should be played to express Li Yuhe's loyalty to the Communist Party, to Chairman Mao, to the proletariat, to the working masses, and to the oppressed nations and peoples of the world who have not yet been liberated. The broad masses of creators, with great enthusiasm, composed and performed the music. One day, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lin Mohan came to watch the rehearsal. After watching, he shot his poisonous arrows, saying that our use of national instruments to perform was "lacking atmosphere, like playing with rats." Due to Lin Mohan's obstruction, the revision of this scene was not well resolved. A small clique of those in power within the China Beijing Opera Theater who are taking the capitalist road, and bourgeois "authorities," dared to openly oppose the Maoist literary line executed by Comrade Jiang Qing in the reform of Beijing opera, sabotaging the revolution of Beijing opera. This is not accidental. The old Propaganda Department and the old Ministry of Culture are their backers, and counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang and Lin Mohan are their bosses! They use two-faced tactics, soft and hard methods, and every possible means to try to extinguish the "red light" of the Beijing opera revolution. However, under the brilliant guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the red light of the literary revolution is indomitable! It burns brighter and more radiantly!

Now that our troupe has been incorporated into the military system, we must, under the leadership of the Central Military Commission, the General Political Department, and Comrade Jiang Qing, strive to study Chairman Mao's works, take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, and seriously reform ourselves. We must resolutely respond to the great call of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao: to care about state affairs and to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

    扑不灭的“红灯”
    中国京剧院　高良
    我院排演革命现代京剧《红灯记》的过程，就是两条文艺路线斗争的过程，就是毛主席文艺路线战胜反革命修正主义文艺黑线的过程。
    江青同志对京剧《红灯记》的创造过程，是十分关怀的。从选择剧本，一直到写作、表演、音乐、唱腔、舞台美术等方面都进行调查研究，亲自指导，提出非常宝贵的意见。可是这些意见，被反革命修正主义分子周扬、林默涵等人肆意篡改，他们根本不把江青同志的意见原原本本向群众传达。我院一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，则与周扬、林默涵等人上呼下应，串通一起，竭力阻挠京剧革命。在《红灯记》的编演过程中，我们经历了一场尖锐复杂的斗争。
    《红灯记》第三场“粥棚”是很重要的一场戏，江青同志指出，这场戏应该表现出李玉和同群众的密切关系，以及当时的社会背景；应该进一步用行动来歌颂李玉和在敌人面前脸不变色心不跳，沉着、机智、勇敢的无产阶级英雄性格，突出一个共产党员的优秀品质。但是他们采取了欺上瞒下、阳奉阴违的卑鄙手段，硬把这场戏去掉。后来在江青同志一再坚持的情况下，他们才不得不加上。江青同志还指出要突出剧中英雄人物，对反面人物的表演和处理，要给工农兵英雄人物让路，不搞平分秋色，不要喧宾夺主。可是这些家伙听不进去，偏要搞平分秋色，着力刻划反面人物来哗众取宠，他们说什么：“有戏，要抓住观众，各找各的窍头”。
    对“刑场斗争”一场戏，江青同志曾几次指出：这场戏，李玉和要大唱一下。要用成套的完美的唱腔，来集中抒发李玉和这个英雄人物胸怀祖国、放眼世界的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神。要有音乐形象，进一步表现出李玉和身在监狱，眼望世界革命，临危不惧的共产党员坚贞不屈的英雄品质。这是树立高大的工农兵英雄形象的一场关键戏。而一小撮资产阶级的反动“权威”，从他们的阶级感情出发，胡说什么：李玉和在这场戏里唱多了不合适，尤其要唱成套的唱腔，非给观众唱“死”不可！他们极力渲染斗争的残酷性，用酷刑拷打，用资产阶级的儿女情长来“刺激”观众，这样既歪曲了三代人的英雄形象，也损害了《红灯记》的革命主题。
    江青同志又指出：在这场戏中李玉和在走向刑场的时候，要奏出庄严的《国际歌》，用来表现李玉和这个无产阶级革命者忠于共产党、忠于毛主席、忠于无产阶级、忠于劳动大众、忠于世界上还没有解放的被压迫民族、被压迫人民的临危不惧的崇高品质。广大创作干部根据这个意见，满腔热忱地进行谱曲和演奏。有一天，反革命修正主义分子林默涵来看彩排，看完就放出了毒箭，说我们用民族乐器演奏，“没有气氛，好像耍耗子一样。”由于林默涵的阻挠，这场戏的修改一直没有很好地解决。中国京剧院一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级“权威”，所以敢在京剧改革上，公开反对江青同志所执行的毛主席文艺路线，破坏京剧革命，这绝不是偶然的。旧中宣部、旧文化部就是他们的靠山，反革命修正主义分子周扬、林默涵等人就是他们的后台老板！他们两面三刀，软硬兼施，千方百计地想扑灭京剧革命的“红灯”。但是，在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，文艺革命的红灯是永远扑不灭的！它越点越亮，越点越灿烂夺目！
    现在我们团列入了军队建制，我们一定要在中央军委、总政治部和江青同志领导下，努力学习毛主席著作，把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，认真改造自己。坚决响应我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的伟大号召：要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
