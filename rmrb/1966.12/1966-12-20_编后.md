Afterword

	Whether it is in daily life and work, or in the sharp and complex class struggle, all of these test whether each of us is a genuine revolutionary of the proletariat.

	In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, an unknown youth, as long as he starts from the interests of the people and constantly breaks down private interests and establishes public interests, can become a revolutionary vanguard. A female cadre from the countryside, because she has a heart that starts from the interests of the people, can always insist on walking the socialist path. A seasoned soldier, only by starting from the interests of the people and carrying out a revolution in his soul, constantly promoting the revolutionization of his thoughts, can he maintain his revolutionary integrity. Whether one can start from the interests of the people and wholeheartedly serve the people depends fundamentally on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, and treating the "Three Articles" as a motto for learning. As long as each of our comrades studies earnestly and acts concretely, our cause will greatly flourish.

    编后
    不论日常的生活、工作，还是尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，都在考验我们每一个人，是不是一个真正的无产阶级革命派。
    在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，一个不出名的青年，只要从人民群众的利益出发，不断破私立公，就能当一名革命闯将。一位农村妇女干部，因为有了从人民群众利益出发的心，就能处处坚持走社会主义道路。一位久经锻炼的战士，也只有从人民群众的利益出发，在自己灵魂深处闹革命，不断促进思想革命化，才能保持革命的晚节。能不能做到一切从人民群众的利益出发，全心全意为人民服务，根本的问题在于活学活用毛主席著作，把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学。只要我们每个同志认真地学，切实地做，我们的事业就会大大兴旺起来。
