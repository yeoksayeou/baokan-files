The Cuban people love Chairman Mao. Many Cuban friends eagerly hope to obtain a Mao Zedong badge.

Once, after receiving a Mao Zedong badge, a worker said, "I admire Chairman Mao. I have always been watching China's progress and development." The worker said, "It's a pity that now we can't buy any Chinese magazines, but it doesn't matter. We will make our own judgments about things."

He praised Chairman Mao, saying, "I firmly believe in Chairman Mao's correctness and greatness. He is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the people of the world. Only such a great leader can lead China's great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

He said that he came to understand the significance of this revolution from the slander and attacks by U.S. imperialism and its allies against the Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "We should look at these slanders and attacks from the opposite side. Chairman Mao said, 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.'"

A Cuban female teacher who loves studying Chinese history and is a poetry enthusiast can recite many of Chairman Mao's poems. She said that her most revered poet is the great Chairman Mao. She said, "Chairman Mao's poems are filled with a revolutionary spirit as vast as the ocean and as lofty as the mountains. Only a great people's leader like Chairman Mao can write such poems."

She used her spare time to translate parts of Chairman Mao's poems from the English version into Spanish and sent her translations to Chinese comrades. She said, "I only want the Chinese comrades to understand my grasp of Chairman Mao's poems and to express my respect for Chairman Mao."

    古巴人民心向毛泽东
    古巴人民热爱毛主席，很多古巴朋友热切地希望得到一枚毛主席像章。
    有一次，一位工人在得到了一枚毛主席像章之后说：“我敬佩毛主席，我一直注视着中国的进步和发展。”这位工人说：“遗憾的是现在什么中国杂志都买不到了，但是，没有关系，我们对事情会作出自己的判断的。”
    他赞扬毛主席说：“我坚信毛主席的正确和伟大，他不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是世界人民的伟大领袖。只有这样伟大的领袖，才能领导中国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。”
    他说，他是从美帝国主义及其同盟者对中国无产阶级文化大革命的诬蔑和攻击中来认识这场革命的意义的。他说：“我们要从反面来看待这些诬蔑和攻击。毛主席说过：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’”
    一位酷爱研究中国历史的古巴女教师是诗歌爱好者，她能把许多首毛主席诗词背诵出来。她说，她最崇敬的诗人是伟大的毛主席。她说，毛主席的诗词“充满了像海洋一样辽阔、像山岳一样崇高的革命气概。只有像毛主席这样伟大的人民领袖才能写出这样的诗篇。”
    她利用业余时间把毛主席诗词英文版中的部分诗词译成西班牙文，并把她的译文送给中国同志。她说，她这样做只是想让中国同志了解她“对毛主席诗词的理解程度，并表达对毛主席的敬意”。
