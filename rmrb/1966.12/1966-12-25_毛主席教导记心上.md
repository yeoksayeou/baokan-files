The militia members of Shuitun Brigade, Licheng County, Shandong Province, who were personally inspected by our great leader Chairman Mao, have studied the Quotations from Chairman Mao and have seen immediate results. They generally feel that the Quotations from Chairman Mao are the most precious treasure, easy to study, easy to remember, and easy to apply. Studying the Quotations from Chairman Mao is indeed a good way to study Mao Zedong Thought.

When studying the Quotations from Chairman Mao, the militia members of this brigade pay attention to combining their studies with the current situation, the central task, their thoughts, and production, aiming at specific targets. For instance, in June this year, during the wheat harvest and rice transplanting season, farm work was heavy, time was tight, and tasks were numerous. The seventh platoon of militia lacked confidence in completing the tasks. They collectively studied the quotation from Chairman Mao: "Resolutely set your mind on it, be not afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." This boosted their morale, and they successfully completed the tasks.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the militia members of this brigade selected and studied the quotation from Chairman Mao: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters, should be subjected to criticism. They must not be allowed to spread unchecked." Through their studies, everyone unanimously declared: We must resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, destroy the Four Olds, establish the Four News, and resolutely carry out the Sixteen Points and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to complete the tasks of one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The militia members of this brigade hold a lecture meeting once a month to share their experiences of studying and applying the Quotations from Chairman Mao to solve problems, and to eliminate private interests and establish public interests. They also set up quotation boards and quotation signs on streets and alleys to facilitate learning and applying the Quotations from Chairman Mao at any time.

    毛主席教导记心上
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自视察过的山东历城北园公社水屯大队的民兵们，大学毛主席语录，收到了立竿见影的效果。他们普遍反映：毛主席语录是宝中宝，学起来方便，记起来方便，用起来方便。学习毛主席语录，真是学习毛泽东思想的一种好方法。
    这个大队的民兵在学习毛主席语录时，注意结合形势，结合中心，结合思想，结合生产，有的放矢。如今年六月，是麦收和插秧季节，农活多，时间紧，任务重，第七排民兵对完成任务缺乏信心。他们集体学习毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”鼓起了干劲，终于，出色地完成了任务。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个大队的民兵又选学了毛主席语录：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”通过学习，大家一致表示：要坚决支持红卫兵小将的革命行动，破四旧，立四新，坚决贯彻执行十六条，贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，完成一斗二批三改的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    这个大队的民兵，每月举行一次讲用会，讲述自己带着问题活学活用毛主席语录，破私立公的体会。他们还在大街小巷设立了毛主席语录牌和语录板，以便随时学，随时用。
