The Soviet revisionists, in order to further split the Asian and African writers' movement, held an illegal so-called third preparatory committee meeting of the Asian and African Writers' Conference in Cairo from November 13 to 14, in collusion with a small group of followers and those who are unaware of the truth. They planned to hold an illegal third Asian and African Writers' Conference next March to establish a so-called Asian and African Writers' Association.

All the documents passed at this Cairo splitist meeting do not contain a single word about "opposing American imperialism" or "supporting the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples." They do not expose and condemn the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in the Vietnam War, nor do they say a single word in support of the Vietnamese people's just war of resistance against American aggression. The entire proceedings of the meeting clearly show that the Soviet revisionists, in their urgent need to peddle the political line of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world" and "unite with the United States against China," have stripped off their last fig leaf and adopted more open methods of betrayal against the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples, shamelessly exposing their traitorous faces.

It is well known that in late June of this year, representatives from 53 countries and regions successfully held an emergency conference of Asian and African writers in Beijing, highlighing the banner of unity and struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States. At that time, the Soviet revisionists, who intended to sabotage the unity and anti-imperialist cause of the Asian and African peoples, held a splitist meeting in Cairo from June 19 to 20 to obstruct and sabotage this conference and split the Asian and African writers' movement. To salvage the failure of the Cairo meeting, they held another farcical writers' splitist meeting in Baku, Soviet Union, from August 30 to September 1. The so-called third preparatory committee meeting of the Asian and African Writers' Conference held in Cairo this time is a carefully staged production by the Soviet revisionists based on the illegal resolutions of the Cairo-Baku splitist meetings. However, like the previous two splitist meetings, the number of participants in this meeting was still very small; even if all the so-called representatives who were unaware of the truth are counted, there were only 13 units participating. The originally scheduled four-day meeting was hastily concluded after only two days.

The splitist meeting held in Cairo after the Beijing emergency conference of Asian and African writers indicates that the splitist crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique among the Asian and African peoples have reached a new level. Currently, on the one hand, the Asian and African writers' movement, representing the vast majority of revolutionary writers in Asia and Africa, is united under the leadership of the Colombo Asian and African Writers' Permanent Secretariat, headed by Secretary-General Senanayake, and is holding high the banner of unity and anti-imperialism, which has received widespread support from Asian and African writers and peoples and has had a far-reaching impact. On the other hand, there are those represented by the Soviet revisionists and their small group of followers, who not only do not support the revolutionary struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and old and new colonialism, but also "urge" Asian and African writers to follow the Soviet revisionists in surrendering to imperialism without distinguishing between enemies and friends, creating new deceptions among Asian and African intellectuals. However, this plot has been spurned by the vast majority of Asian and African writers and peoples.

This Cairo splitist meeting openly "urges" all Asian and African writers and writers from around the world to "eliminate their differences" without distinguishing between enemies and friends. This shows that the meeting, planned by the Soviet revisionists, has formally elevated the capitulationist line pursued by the Soviet leadership as its overall program. In the draft "Charter of the Asian and African Writers' Association" passed at the meeting, it is even more blatantly stipulated that it will accept "guest members" from "non-Asian and African countries," attempting to open the door for the United States to interfere in the "Asian and African writers' movement." The memorandum of the budget subcommittee passed at the meeting shamelessly stipulates that the fake third Asian and African Writers' Conference and the so-called "Asian and African Writers' Association" will submit applications for funds and donations to UNESCO. This further exposes the Soviet revisionists' shameful plan to bring the Asian and African writers' movement under the track of their "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," revealing that the fake "three conferences" and the so-called "Asian and African Writers' Association" are actually a "cultural exchange" jointly operated by the United States and the Soviet Union.

### 加紧推行投降主义路线　力图开办美苏“文化交易所”  苏修公开分裂亚非作家运动出卖反帝斗争  伙同一小撮追随者在开罗开会策划成立所谓“亚非作家协会”

    加紧推行投降主义路线　力图开办美苏“文化交易所”
    苏修公开分裂亚非作家运动出卖反帝斗争
    伙同一小撮追随者在开罗开会策划成立所谓“亚非作家协会”
    新华社十七日讯　苏联修正主义者为了进一步分裂亚非作家运动，在十一月十三日至十四日又伙同其一小撮追随者和不明真相的人在开罗非法召开了所谓的第三次亚非作家大会筹备委员会会议，策划在明年三月间召开非法的第三次亚非作家大会，成立所谓亚非作家协会。
    这次开罗分裂会议通过的所有文件，没有任何一处写上“反对美帝国主义”或者“支持亚非人民反帝斗争”，更没有揭露和谴责美帝国主义在侵略越南战争中所犯下的滔天罪行，没有一句话支持越南人民神圣的抗美救国战争。会议的进程完全表明：苏联修正主义者为了兜售“美苏合作主宰世界”和“联美反华”政治路线的迫切需要，已扯下仅有的遮羞布，对亚非人民反帝斗争采取了更加公开的出卖手段，赤裸裸地暴露了革命叛徒的可耻面貌。
    人所共知，今年六月底，五十三个国家和地区的代表在北京成功地举行了亚非作家紧急会议，高高地举起了支持亚非拉人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的团结战斗旗帜。当时，蓄意破坏亚非人民团结反帝事业的苏联修正主义者为了阻挠和破坏这个会议，分裂亚非作家运动，曾一手导演和制造了一个于六月十九日至二十日在开罗举行的分裂会议。为了挽救开罗会议的惨败，又于八月三十日到九月一日在苏联的巴库召开了另一次很不像样的作家分裂会议。这次在开罗举行的所谓第三次亚非作家大会筹备委员会会议，就是苏联修正主义者根据开罗—巴库分裂会议的非法决议煞费苦心地导演出来的。但是，像上两次分裂会议一样，参加这个会议的仍然寥寥无几，连那些不明真相的所谓代表们统统都算上，一共只不过有十三个单位参加；原定四天的会议，只开了两天便草草收场了。
    在北京亚非作家紧急会议之后召开的这次开罗分裂会议，说明苏联修正主义领导集团在亚非人民中进行的分裂罪行已经升到了新的一级。目前，一方面是代表着亚非广大革命作家的亚非作家运动，团聚在以森纳那亚克为秘书长的科伦坡亚非作家常设局的周围，高举着团结反帝旗帜，得到了亚非作家和人民广泛的支持，产生了日益深远的影响；另一方面则是以苏联修正主义者及其一小撮追随者为代表，他们不仅不支持亚非人民反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义的革命斗争，反而“号召”亚非作家不分敌我地跟随苏联修正主义一起去投降帝国主义，在亚非知识分子中制造新的骗局。但是这个阴谋已经遭到亚非广大作家和人民的唾弃。
    这次开罗分裂会议公开“号召”所有亚非作家及全世界作家，不分敌我，“消除他们之间的分歧”。这就表明，由苏联修正主义者所策划的这次会议，已把苏联领导集团所推行的投降主义路线正式升级作为它的总纲领。在会议通过的伪“亚非作家协会章程（草案）”中，更公然规定它将接纳“非亚非国家”的什么“客人会员”参加，企图为美国插手“亚非作家运动”敞开大门。会议通过的预算小组委员会备忘录，还恬不知耻地规定了，伪第三次亚非作家大会和所谓的“亚非作家协会”将向联合国教科文组织提出乞求经费和捐款的函件。这就更暴露了苏联修正主义者想把亚非作家运动纳入它的“美苏合作主宰世界”的轨道的可耻计划，暴露出伪“三大”与所谓“亚非作家协会”实际就是美苏合股开办的“文化交易所”。
