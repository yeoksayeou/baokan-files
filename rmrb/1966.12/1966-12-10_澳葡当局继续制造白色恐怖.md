The Portuguese authorities in Macau continue to create a white terror. They have dispatched large numbers of military and police forces, arresting and beating people, looting shops, and seriously threatening the lives and property of Macau compatriots.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 9th: According to news from Macau, the city has been under a terror-filled atmosphere for several days. The Portuguese imperialists continue to dispatch large numbers of military and police forces, armed to the teeth, to harass residents and seek opportunities to escalate the situation.

Currently, the Portuguese authorities in Macau are still implementing martial law and, outside of martial law hours, are arresting and beating people everywhere, crazily looting shops. Portuguese public officials have also been issued handguns and are allowed to shoot at any time. Even now, gunshots can still be heard on the streets of Macau. All of this seriously threatens the lives and property of Macau compatriots. On the afternoon of the 6th, two young men were suddenly beaten and arrested by a group of Portuguese military and police with gun butts as they passed by the Ferry Street. On the same day, three young men delivering goods were brutally arrested by Portuguese police as they passed by a Portuguese police station.

In recent days, Portuguese military and police forces have not only arbitrarily arrested people on the streets but have also brazenly entered residential buildings to search and arrest Macau compatriots. The Portuguese authorities even dispatched disguised "reporters" to conduct "interviews" everywhere. As soon as these "reporters" leave, armed military and police forces immediately arrive to arrest people.

According to reports, since December 3rd, more than sixty Macau compatriots have been unjustly arrested by the Portuguese authorities, and many more have gone missing with unknown whereabouts.

Macau compatriots are resolutely fighting against the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities. Under pressure from Macau compatriots, the Portuguese authorities were forced to announce the number of injured and deceased Macau compatriots on the 8th due to their brutal behavior on December 3rd and 4th. The announcement stated: there were 123 injured, of whom 55 were hospitalized, and 8 died. Macau compatriots have pointed out that the number of casualties announced by the Portuguese authorities is greatly understated, and the Portuguese authorities must confess their crimes truthfully.

    澳葡当局继续制造白色恐怖
    派出大批军警，到处抓人打人，抢劫商店财物，严重威胁澳门同胞生命财产安全
    新华社香港九日电据澳门消息：这几天以来，澳门一直还处在恐怖气氛之中。澳葡帝国主义者继续派出大批军警，荷枪实弹，骚扰居民，伺机扩大事端。
    目前，澳葡当局还继续实行武装戒严，并在非戒严时间内到处抓人、打人，疯狂地抢劫商店财物。澳葡公务人员还领到手枪，被准许随时开枪射击。至今，澳门街道还不时听到枪声。这一切都严重威胁着澳门同胞生命财产的安全。六日下午，有两名青年在路过渡船街时，突然被一群澳葡军警用枪托打伤后逮捕。同一天，有三名送货的青年在经过一所澳葡警署时，竟被野蛮的葡警横加逮捕。
    几天来，澳葡军警不但在街上随意捕人，还明目张胆地闯入居民的楼房搜查和逮捕澳门同胞。澳葡当局甚至派出乔装成“记者”的特务四处进行“采访”，当这些“记者”一离开时，武装的军警随即前来抓人。
    据报道，自十二月三日以后，被澳葡当局无理逮捕的澳门同胞，已知者有六十多名，还有好多人失踪，下落不明。
    澳门同胞对澳葡当局的法西斯暴行正进行坚决的斗争。在澳门同胞的压力下，澳葡当局于八日晚不得不公布十二月三日和四日在他们残暴行为下伤亡的澳门同胞数字。公布中说：受伤者计有一百二十三人，其中五十五人在医院留医，另有八名死亡。澳门同胞严正指出，澳葡当局公布的这个伤亡数字是大大地缩小了的，澳葡当局必须如实认罪。（附图片）
