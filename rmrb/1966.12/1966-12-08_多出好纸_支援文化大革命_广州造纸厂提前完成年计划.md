According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 6th: The revolutionary workers of the Guangzhou Paper Mill have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions to seize the revolution and promote production. During the Cultural Revolution, they have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, channeling the boundless enthusiasm sparked by the Cultural Revolution into production, thereby promoting the development of production. The entire mill has completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule. Compared to the same period last year, the total production of various types of paper in this mill has increased by 17.32% while maintaining and improving product quality. Labor productivity has also increased, and costs have been reduced.

Since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the workers have been determined to produce more and better paper to support the Cultural Revolution. Starting from July, the daily production has been increasing steadily, and in October, a record high in daily production was achieved since the establishment of the mill.

Previously, the commercial pulp produced from Masson pine in this mill was not as good in quality as that of other sister mills. Over the past half year, the workers have collectively innovated more than 40 items of process operations and mechanical equipment, finally making the pulp produced from Masson pine reach the quality level of white pine and poplar pulp.

    多出好纸　支援文化大革命
    广州造纸厂提前完成年计划
    据新华社广州六日电　广州造纸厂革命职工坚决贯彻执行毛主席抓革命，促生产的指示，在文化大革命运动中，活学活用毛主席著作，把在文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天干劲用到生产上，促进了生产的发展，全厂提前完成了今年的生产计划。和去年同期相比，这个厂今年在产品质量稳定上升的基础上，各类纸的总产量提高了百分之一七点三二；劳动生产率也有所提高，成本有所降低。
    无产阶级文化大革命运动开始以后，职工们决心多出纸、出好纸，支援文化大革命。从七月份起，日产量节节上升，十月份创造了建厂以来日产量的最高纪录。
    过去，这个厂用马尾松生产的商品木浆，质量一直不如其他兄弟厂好。半年来，工人们群策群力先后革新四十多项工艺操作和机械设备，终于使马尾松造的木浆，达到了白松、白杨木浆的质量水平。
