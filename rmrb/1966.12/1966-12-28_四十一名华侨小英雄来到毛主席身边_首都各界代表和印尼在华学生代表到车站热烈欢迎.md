The great collective armed with the thought of Chairman Mao, who fought bravely against the reactionaries in Indonesia—forty-one overseas Chinese youth—arrived in the capital of the great motherland, at Chairman Mao's side, filled with boundless affection for the great leader. They sang "Father and Mother Are Dear, But Not as Dear as Chairman Mao" on the train today. Two representatives of the overseas Chinese who bravely participated in the struggle against the "refugee camp" in Medan, Indonesia, also arrived in Beijing by the same train.

These overseas Chinese youth, while fighting against persecution in Indonesia, always thought of the great leader Chairman Mao. On their way to Beijing from southern China, their hearts were filled with immense excitement. Last night, they held a meeting on the train, singing "The East Is Red" and shouting "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!" They wished Chairman Mao eternal life. They said, "We have just returned to the motherland and are already in the capital, at Chairman Mao's side. This is our greatest happiness!"

Today, Beijing Station was filled with a strong revolutionary atmosphere. Large red banners hung above the platform, reading: "Long Live Our Most Beloved Leader Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of overseas Chinese!" Over 1,500 people, including Red Guards, workers, commune members, PLA soldiers, cadres, and representatives of returned overseas Chinese, held up portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with his quotations, welcoming the overseas Chinese youth who had maintained national dignity and defended the motherland's honor. They enthusiastically shouted slogans celebrating the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

As the heroic overseas Chinese youth stepped off the train to the sound of drums, representatives from the Beijing Reception Committee for Forty-one Overseas Chinese Revolutionary Youth and officials such as Liao Chengzhi, Lin Xiude, Yao Zhongming, Ding Guoyi, Cui Gengsheng, and Yuan Gang warmly embraced them, expressing their heartfelt greetings. The overseas Chinese youth, tears of excitement in their eyes, waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and jumped with joy, repeatedly shouting, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!" "Long Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

As the overseas Chinese youth walked through the long line of welcomers, the platform was filled with a moving scene of Red Guards and heroic overseas Chinese youth reuniting in victory. The Little Red Guards of Chairman Mao pinned red flowers with quotations from Chairman Mao and red badges with Chairman Mao's portrait on the chests of their victorious comrades who had returned from the front lines of international class struggle. They also gave them red armbands. At this moment, everyone sang "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" and "Father and Mother Are Dear, But Not as Dear as Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!" "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Down with American Imperialism!" "Down with Soviet Modern Revisionism!" "Down with the Indonesian Reactionaries!"

Zhao Xiaoshou, who had defended the Five-Star Red Flag with his blood in Indonesia, Huang Muhe, who remained steadfast against the Indonesian reactionaries, Wang Weizhen and Ju Qingdong, who had fought bravely against the reactionary regime in Brazil, all came to the station to give a warm welcome. When they met the overseas Chinese youth heroes, everyone embraced and shook hands, filled with pride. They said, "It is the great Mao Zedong Thought that gave us the strength and wisdom to fight against the international class enemies. We must continue to strive together, study Chairman Mao's works diligently, and put his teachings into practice. We must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

Representatives from the Indonesian Students Union in China also came to the station to welcome them. They held up portraits of Chairman Mao and banners written in Indonesian, reading: "The path of Mao Zedong is the only path to victory for the Indonesian people!" "Smash the fascist regime of Suharto-Nasution supported by American imperialism and Soviet revisionism!" The Indonesian friends, filled with fighting friendship, expressed their respect to the overseas Chinese youth at the station.

The forty-one overseas Chinese youth who had achieved glorious victories in their struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries were warmly welcomed by over 1,500 Red Guards and revolutionary masses at Beijing Station.

    四十一名华侨小英雄来到毛主席身边
    首都各界代表和印尼在华学生代表到车站热烈欢迎
    新华社二十七日讯伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的战斗集体——同印度尼西亚反动派进行过英勇斗争的四十一名华侨青少年，满怀着热爱伟大领袖毛主席的无限深情，高唱《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》，今天乘火车来到了伟大祖国的首都，来到了毛主席的身边。在印度尼西亚曾经英勇参加过棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”抗暴斗争的两名难侨青年代表，也同车到达北京。
    这批华侨青少年在印度尼西亚进行反迫害斗争的时候，时时刻刻都在想念着伟大领袖毛主席。他们从祖国南方乘车来北京的路上，心里万分激动，昨晚在火车里举行集会，集体一遍又一遍地高唱《东方红》，高呼“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”祝愿毛主席万寿无疆。他们说：“我们刚回到祖国，就要到首都，就要到毛主席身边，这是我们的最大最大的幸福！”
    今天北京车站洋溢着强烈的革命气氛。月台上高悬大幅红色标语，上面写着：“我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！”“毛主席是华侨心中最红的红太阳！”首都红卫兵、工人、人民公社社员、解放军指战员、机关干部，以及归国华侨代表一千五百多人，高举毛主席像和毛主席语录牌，来到火车站，最热烈地欢迎坚持民族气节、维护祖国尊严的华侨小英雄，尽情地欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    英雄的华侨小将们在锣鼓声中走下火车的时候，首都人民接待四十一名华侨革命青少年工作委员会的代表，以及廖承志、林修德、姚仲明、丁国钰、崔更生、袁庚等有关方面负责人，上前同他们热烈拥抱，向他们表示亲切问候。华侨小将们眼里闪着激动的泪花，挥舞着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，激动地跳跃着，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万万岁！”
  “战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    华侨青少年们穿过长长的欢迎人群时，月台上出现了红卫兵小将同海外归来的英雄中华儿女胜利会师的动人场面。毛主席的红小兵把一朵朵佩有毛主席语录的大红花，一枚枚闪着红光的毛主席像章，别在从国际阶级斗争前线胜利归来的战友们的胸前，并给他们戴上鲜红的红卫兵袖章。这时人们放声齐唱《大海航行靠舵手》、《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》，不断地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”
  “打倒印尼反动派！”
    曾经在印度尼西亚用鲜血保卫五星国旗的外交战士赵小寿，在印度尼西亚反动派面前坚贞不屈的爱国侨胞黄沐和，同巴西反动当局进行过英勇斗争的王唯真和鞠庆东，今天都到车站热烈欢迎。他们同华侨小英雄会见的时候，大家又是拥抱，又是握手，人人心中充满了自豪感。他们说：是伟大的毛泽东思想，给了我们同国际阶级敌人进行斗争的力量和智慧。我们今后更要共同努力，活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的教导印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    印度尼西亚在华学生联合会的代表们，今天也到车站欢迎。他们高举着毛主席像和标语，标语上用印尼文写着：“毛泽东的道路是印尼人民革命胜利的唯一道路！”“粉碎美帝国主义和苏联修正主义支持下的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权！”印尼朋友们满怀战斗友情，在车站上向华侨青少年表示敬意。（附图片）
