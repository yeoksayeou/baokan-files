The New Year is approaching. To better and more widely propagate Mao Zedong Thought and to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we propose the following: In both urban and rural areas, in places where spring couplets were previously posted, post quotations from Chairman Mao, the Sixteen Points, or revolutionary spring couplets. The content of the quotations and the Sixteen Points can be chosen according to actual circumstances. In this way, during the New Year and Spring Festival, we will have more opportunities to receive education in Mao Zedong Thought.

    广泛张贴毛主席语录
    新的一年快到了。为了更好地、更广泛地宣传毛泽东思想，搞好无产阶级文化大革命，特此建议：无论是城市、农村，在过去贴春联的地方，都贴上毛主席语录、十六条或革命春联。语录和十六条的内容，可结合实际情况选择。这样，我们在新年和春节期间，就可以有更多机会受到毛泽东思想的教育。
