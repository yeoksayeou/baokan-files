The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement on December 7, strongly condemning the U.S. warplanes' indiscriminate bombing of Chinese fishing boats in international waters on November 30 and December 1, which resulted in the deaths and injuries of Chinese fishermen.

The statement said: "Since the beginning of this year, U.S. aircraft have repeatedly attacked Chinese fishing boats and merchant ships. These heinous acts by U.S. imperialism are serious provocations against the People's Republic of China and blatantly violate international norms regarding the freedom of fishing boats and merchant ships in international waters."

The statement said: "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns the aforementioned crimes of U.S. imperialism and demands that it must stop its provocative actions against the People's Republic of China. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully supports the solemn position stated in the statement by the Spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China on December 5, 1966."

The statement emphasized: "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Vietnamese people and the Chinese people. The Vietnamese people and the Chinese people stand shoulder to shoulder, resolutely defeating the U.S. aggressors, and resolutely resisting all U.S. provocative actions against the People's Republic of China."
