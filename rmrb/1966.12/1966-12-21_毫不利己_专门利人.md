On the night of November 28, 1938, the hospital received a letter from the frontline commander, instructing the medical team to rush to the frontline the next day to perform medical duties. The hospital was over a hundred miles away from the frontline, with rugged mountains and narrow paths making travel extremely difficult. The cold in Yanbei was severe, with temperatures dropping to minus twenty or thirty degrees. Upon hearing the situation, Comrade White described it as "immediate departure."

The medical team, riding horses and leading medicine-laden mules, traversed endless mountains and valleys, arriving at a small valley just twelve miles from the frontline by noon the next day. The operating room was set up in a small temple in the valley. By then, the battle had already started. The sound of machine guns and exploding hand grenades filled the air. Soon, batches of wounded soldiers were brought in. Comrade White focused intently on performing surgery on the wounded, forgetting to eat. Comrades repeatedly urged him to rest, but he said, "The lives of the wounded are crucial; what does it matter if I rest a little less?"

The surgeries continued non-stop until the next morning. A buzzing sound came from the sky, and four enemy planes circled overhead. "Boom! Boom!" The enemy planes dropped bombs, causing the operating room's tent to flutter wildly. Comrades urged White to take cover, but he firmly said, "Can frontline soldiers stop fighting because of air raids? No! Our battlefield is the operating table. Leaving the operating table is like abandoning the battlefield. We must hold our ground." He continued the surgery. Suddenly, a loud explosion shook the temple, followed by a crash as a cloud of dust fell near the operating table. The guard rushed in, panting, "A bomb fell forty meters behind the temple, and the back wall collapsed."

Comrades were all worried about White's safety. A comrade from the political department of the brigade urged again, "Comrade White, please take cover. We must ensure your safety!"

Comrade White stood unmoved and said, "Revolutionaries cannot prioritize personal safety. Fighting against fascism is not safe. If I came to China for personal safety, I wouldn't have come. Only by eliminating fascism can we have the most reliable safety. Communists cannot think of personal safety first."

Comrade White's righteous words deeply moved everyone. Everyone had only one thought: everything for the wounded, everything for the battle.

In this battle, Comrade White went two days and nights without sleep, performing surgery on seventy-one wounded soldiers. The treatment was very effective, with eighty-five percent of the wounded in good condition. He excitedly said, "This treatment has set a new world record. Time is power, time is the life of class brothers!"

    毫不利己　专门利人
    一九三八年十一月二十八日深夜，医院接到前线部队首长的信，要医疗队在第二天务必赶到前线，执行疗伤任务。医院离前线有一百多里路，沿途崇山峻岭，崎岖小路，行走非常困难。雁北酷寒，气温在零下二三十度。白求恩同志听了情况后，果断地说：“马上出发。”
    医疗队一行骑着马，牵着药驮子，经过绵延不绝的高山和山谷，于第二天中午到达离前线只有十二里路的一个小山沟。手术室就布置在小山沟的一座小庙里。这时阵地上已经打响了。机枪声、手榴弹的爆炸声响成一片。不大一会儿，伤员一批一批送到了。白求恩同志全神贯注地给伤员施行手术，连饭都忘了吃。同志们几次劝他休息，他说：“伤员的生命要紧，我少休息一会有什么关系。”
    手术不断地进行到第二天上午。天空传来一片嗡嗡声，四架敌机盘旋在上空。“轰！轰！”敌机投弹了，气浪冲激，手术台上的帐顶哗哗乱动。同志们劝白求恩同志去隐蔽，他坚定地说：“前线的战士，能不能因为空袭而停止作战？不！我们的战斗岗位是手术台，离开手术台就是离开阵地。要坚守阵地。”说着，仍继续进行手术。突然，轰的一声，小庙剧烈震动了一下，接着，“哗啦”一声，一片尘土落在手术台旁。警卫员跑进来呼吸急促地说：“一个炸弹落在庙后四十米的地方，庙的后墙被震塌了。”
    同志们都为白求恩同志的安全担心。旅政治部的同志再一次劝说：“白求恩同志，赶紧隐蔽一下吧，我们要对你的安全负责！”
    白求恩同志岿然不动地说：“闹革命就不能先顾个人的安全。和法西斯作战，就不安全。如果为了个人安全，我就不到中国来了。只有消灭法西斯，才有最可靠的安全。共产党员不能先为个人的安全着想。”
    白求恩同志正气凛然的语言，深深地感动了同志们。大家只有一个念头：一切为了伤员，一切为了战斗。
    在这次战斗里，白求恩同志两天两夜没有合眼，先后给七十一个伤员做了手术。治疗效果非常好，百分之八十五的伤员情况良好。他十分兴奋地说：“这一次治疗，开创了世界新纪录。可见，时间就是力量，时间就是阶级兄弟的生命！”
