	The article said: "The Chinese people who are carrying out this great Chinese revolution clearly understand the characteristics of the new era. No matter how complex the problems are, the Chinese Communist Party can solve them successfully."

	The article said that the Chinese Communist Party is advancing victoriously on the path of resolutely opposing imperialism and revisionism, which makes American imperialism fearful.

It is under these circumstances that we understand that true Marxists-Leninists must stand shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese Communist Party, with the great teacher of the world communist movement today, Comrade Mao Zedong—with the great leader of the world proletariat today, Comrade Mao Zedong, who has been tested by war and the people's struggle."

    文章说：“进行这场伟大的中国革命的中国人民，清楚地懂得当前新时代的特点。无论面临着多么复杂的问题，中国共产党都能顺利解决。”
