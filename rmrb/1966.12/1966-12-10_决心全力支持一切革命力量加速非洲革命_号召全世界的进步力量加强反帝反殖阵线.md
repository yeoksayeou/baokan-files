The special conference of the All-African Trade Union Federation strongly condemns the U.S. imperialist aggression against Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is determined to fully support all revolutionary forces to accelerate the African revolution and calls on all progressive forces around the world to strengthen the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist front. It has decided to move the headquarters of the All-African Trade Union Federation from Accra, Ghana, which is under U.S. control, to Dar es Salaam.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Dar es Salaam on the 9th, the special conference of the All-African Trade Union Federation was held from the 2nd to the 6th of this month. Approximately 30 countries from Africa sent trade union workers to attend this conference.

The conference passed a general resolution, strongly condemning the international imperialism led by U.S. imperialism for its aggression against Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and "praising the determination of the Vietnamese workers and the heroic people to drive out the U.S. aggressors from their own country."

The conference decided to move the headquarters of the All-African Trade Union Federation from Accra, Ghana, to Dar es Salaam, and elected Mamadou Famadi Sissoko from Mali as the general secretary of the All-African Trade Union Federation to replace John Tettegah from Ghana.

The general resolution passed by the conference severely condemned the "international imperialism led by U.S. imperialism for launching offensives against the people of the world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, strengthening exploitation methods, mass arrests, and assassinations of leaders of political organizations and trade unions, and allowing their puppets to continue to rule."

The general resolution called on all progressive forces around the world to strengthen the front against imperialism and colonialism and urged workers in independent revolutionary countries to "remain vigilant forever, use revolutionary violence to resist subversive actions, counter-revolutionary plots, and imperialist coups to safeguard the fruits of the revolution."

The conference also passed a resolution, "condemning the Western imperialist countries led by U.S. imperialism" and the South African racist regime for continuing to support Portuguese colonialists.

In another resolution, the conference strongly protested the arbitrary arrest by the puppet authorities in Accra of trade unionists from Morocco and Upper Volta who were attending this special conference.

Tanzania's second vice president, Kawawa, spoke at the opening ceremony of the conference. He emphasized the need for African trade union workers to unite in their common struggle. He pointed out that foreign aid to Africa or aid from Africa to other countries should not come with conditions.

Vice Chairman of the All-African Trade Union Federation, Mishael Kamaliza (Tanzania), strongly condemned imperialist conspiracies and subversive activities against Africa in his speech.

After the conference, the newly elected general secretary of the All-African Trade Union Federation, Mamadou Famadi Sissoko, held a press conference on the 8th, strongly condemning the imperialist-planned military coup in Ghana. He emphasized that "U.S. imperialism has controlled Ghana." The special conference of the All-African Trade Union Federation decided to move the headquarters of the All-African Trade Union Federation from Accra to Dar es Salaam because the imperialist attack on Ghana had left the headquarters in Accra "paralyzed."

He said that the All-African Trade Union Federation will continue to fight against imperialism and colonialism and do its utmost to support all revolutionary forces to accelerate the African revolution.

U.S. imperialism out of Africa!
Tanzania, El Hassan

    全非工联特别代表大会强烈谴责美帝对亚非拉的侵略
    决心全力支持一切革命力量加速非洲革命
    号召全世界的进步力量加强反帝反殖阵线
    决定将全非工会联合会总部从美帝控制下的加纳迁到坦桑尼亚
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆九日电　全非工会联合会特别代表大会从二日到六日在这里举行。大约有三十个非洲国家的工会工作者参加了这次大会。
    大会通过一项总决议，强烈谴责以美帝国主义为首的国际帝国主义对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的侵略，并“赞扬越南工人和英勇的人民要把美国侵略者赶出自己国家的决心”。
    会议把全非工会联合会的总部从加纳的阿克拉迁移到达累斯萨拉姆，并选举马里的马马杜·法马迪·西索科为全非工会联合会的总书记，以代替加纳的约翰·特特加。
    大会通过的总决议严厉谴责“以美帝国主义为首的国际帝国主义对世界人民、特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民发动攻势，加强剥削手段，大规模逮捕、暗杀政治组织和工会组织的领导人，并使它们的傀儡继续执政”。
    总决议号召全世界的进步力量加强反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的阵线，并呼吁独立的革命国家的工人“永远保持警惕，用革命的暴力反对颠覆行动、反革命阴谋和帝国主义政变，以维护革命的成果”。
    大会还通过决议，“谴责以美帝国主义为首的西方帝国主义国家”和南非种族主义政权继续援助葡萄牙殖民主义者。
    在另一个决议中，大会强烈抗议阿克拉傀儡当局在阿克拉专横地逮捕出席这次特别代表大会的摩洛哥和上沃尔特的工会人士。
    坦桑尼亚第二副总统卡瓦瓦在大会开幕式上讲了话。他强调非洲工会工作者在共同的斗争中要团结一致。他指出外国给非洲的援助或者非洲给其他国家的援助都不应当附带条件。
    全非工会联合会副主席米沙勒·卡马利扎（坦桑尼亚）在讲话中强烈谴责帝国主义对非洲的阴谋和颠覆活动。
    在会议闭幕后，新当选的全非工会联合会总书记马马杜·法马迪·西索科八日在这里举行记者招待会，强烈地谴责了帝国主义策划的加纳军事政变。他强调说，“美帝国主义控制了加纳。”全非工会联合会特别代表大会决定把全非工会联合会的总部从阿克拉迁到达累斯萨拉姆，因为帝国主义对加纳的进攻使阿克拉的全非工会联合会总部“处于瘫痪状态”。
    他说，全非工会联合会将坚持反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，竭尽全力支持一切革命力量以加速非洲革命。（附图片）
