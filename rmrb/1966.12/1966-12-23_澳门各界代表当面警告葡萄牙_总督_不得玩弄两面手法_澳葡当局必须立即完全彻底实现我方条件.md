Representatives from various circles in Macau, including Liang Pei, He Xian, Tan Liming, Rong Baoshan, and Yuan Zirong, along with ten others, visited the "Governor's Office" in the afternoon of the 20th to urge the Portuguese "Governor" of Macau, Carlos da Cunha, to immediately and completely fulfill the four conditions stated in the declaration by the Director of the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office and the six demands of the people of Macau. They warned the Macau Portuguese authorities not to play both sides.

Prior to this, the representatives had received a written response from the Macau Portuguese authorities regarding the protest letter and six demands submitted by the representatives of various circles in Macau. This response not only lacked any genuine remorse but also distorted facts, evaded the main issues, shifted blame, and played both sides. The representatives were extremely dissatisfied with the Macau Portuguese authorities' written response and returned it to Governor Carlos da Cunha on the 20th.

During the meeting with Carlos da Cunha, the representatives sternly pointed out that the November 15th bloodshed in Taipa and the "December 3rd" massacre were entirely premeditated, planned, and organized by the Macau Portuguese authorities. The Macau Portuguese authorities must bear all responsibility and cannot evade it. In their written response, the Macau Portuguese authorities not only refused to acknowledge that the shooting of Chinese residents by Portuguese military and police was a fascist atrocity but instead claimed it was "injuries and deaths resulting from disturbances," describing the martial law as "maintaining social order" and the shooting of people as "preventing looting and ensuring the safety of citizens." Such a serious distortion of facts not only failed to take responsibility for the incident but also attempted to shift the blame onto the Chinese residents who were killed and injured. This is unacceptable.

The representatives sternly pointed out that after deliberately orchestrating the fascist bloodbath, the Macau Portuguese authorities adopted a two-faced approach. On one hand, under the pressure of the great people of our motherland and all the people of Macau, they had to announce the acceptance of the six demands of the people of Macau. On the other hand, without the consent of the various circles in Macau, they released the culprits, Schwena, Yang Duanni, and Yan Deqi, and have not yet responded to the demand for them to confess in person, sign a confession, and publish it in newspapers and on the radio.

The representatives also told Carlos da Cunha: The four conditions proposed by the Director of the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office are precisely the demands of the people of Macau and should be implemented quickly, completely, and thoroughly. For seventeen years, you have harbored and utilized the Kuomintang spies in Macau to conduct activities that harm the interests of the Chinese people and the people of Macau. The Macau Portuguese authorities must take effective measures to eliminate all organizations and activities of the Kuomintang spies in Macau to meet the six demands of the people of Macau and the four conditions proposed by the Director of the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office.

The representatives warned the Macau Portuguese authorities: Regarding the four conditions proposed by the Director of the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office and the six demands of the people of Macau, the Macau Portuguese authorities must immediately and completely fulfill them. Otherwise, all serious consequences that arise from this must be fully borne by the Macau Portuguese authorities.

    澳门各界代表当面警告葡萄牙“总督”不得玩弄两面手法
    澳葡当局必须立即完全彻底实现我方条件
    新华社香港二十二日电　澳门各界代表梁培、何贤、谭立明、容宝山、阮子荣等十三人，二十日下午前往“澳督府”，督促澳门葡萄牙“总督”嘉乐庇立即完全彻底实现广东外事处处长声明中提出的四项条件和澳门同胞的六项要求，当面警告澳葡当局不得玩弄两面手法。
    在此以前，代表们曾收到澳葡当局就澳门各界同胞代表提出的抗议书和六项要求所作的书面答复。这个答复不仅毫无悔罪诚意，而且还颠倒是非，避重就轻，推卸罪责，玩弄两面手法。代表们对澳葡当局的书面答复极端不满，于二十日当面退给了澳葡“总督”嘉乐庇。
    代表们在会见嘉乐庇时严正指出，十一月十五日氹仔流血事件和“一二·三”血案，完全是澳葡当局有预谋、有计划、有组织地蓄意制造的，澳葡当局必须承担一切罪责，不容抵赖。澳葡当局在书面答复中，对澳葡军警打死打伤中国居民的严重事件不但不承认是法西斯暴行，反而说成是“获悉骚动而引起受伤，并有死亡”，把戒严说成是“维持社会秩序”，把开枪杀死人说成“防止抢劫，保障市民的生命安全”。这样严重地歪曲事实，不但没有把事件的责任承担起来，反而企图把责任转嫁到被打死打伤的中国居民身上。这是决不能容许的。
    代表们严正指出，澳葡当局在蓄意制造法西斯血腥事件之后，采取两面手法，一方面在我们伟大祖国人民和全澳同胞的压力下，不得不宣布接受澳门同胞的六项要求，另一方面，未经澳门各界同胞的同意就将凶手施维纳、颜端尼和晏德地放走，而且对于当面认罪，签署认罪书并在报章及电台公布的要求，还没有作出答复。
    代表们还对嘉乐庇指出：广东外事处处长所提出的四项条件，正是澳门同胞的要求，应迅速、全部、彻底地实现。你们十七年来纵容蒋帮特务在澳门并利用澳门进行破坏中国的活动，严重地损害中国人民和澳门同胞的利益。澳葡当局必须迅速采取有效措施肃清蒋匪特务在澳门的一切组织和活动，才能符合澳门同胞的六项要求和广东外事处处长提出的四项条件。
    代表们警告澳葡当局：对于我广东外事处处长在声明中提出的四项条件和澳门同胞的六项要求，澳葡当局必须立即全部、彻底实现。否则，由此而产生的一切严重后果，必须由澳葡当局完全负责。
