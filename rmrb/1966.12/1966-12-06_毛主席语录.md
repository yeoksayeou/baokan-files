	To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the armed military. However, having only this kind of military is not enough; we must also have a cultural military. This is an indispensable force for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy.

    毛主席语录
    我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。
