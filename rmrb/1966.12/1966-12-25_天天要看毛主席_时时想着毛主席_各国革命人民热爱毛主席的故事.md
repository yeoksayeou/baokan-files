Various countries' revolutionary people have an infinite love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. They regard obtaining a portrait of Chairman Mao or a Chairman Mao badge as the happiest event in their lives and a great source of inspiration for their revolutionary spirit.

Treasure Chairman Mao's Portrait as a Family Heirloom

"For many days, I have yearned to have a portrait of Chairman Mao in my home. He is the most brilliant figure of our time, the greatest and most wise Marxist-Leninist of the contemporary era. A portrait of Comrade Mao Zedong can inspire the fighting spirit of revolutionaries. I will buy the best frame to mount Chairman Mao's portrait and hang it in the center of the room, as a family heirloom to be passed down from generation to generation." This is an excerpt from a letter sent from abroad, brimming with fervent love for our great leader.

Nowadays, letters filled with boundless love for our great leader pour in from various parts of the world. They request a portrait of Chairman Mao or a Chairman Mao badge. They regard obtaining these as the happiest events in their lives.

Seeing Chairman Mao, Everything Becomes Energizing

The September special issue of "People's Pictorial" published many photographs of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards, as well as a large color portrait of Chairman Mao. This issue was enthusiastically welcomed by revolutionaries from various countries. An Argentine friend wrote, "What a great issue of 'People's Pictorial'! Chairman Mao's photograph is excellent. In the future, every issue of the pictorial should include a photograph of Chairman Mao. This is extremely important for the world. Chairman Mao's photograph will give great encouragement to the proletariat of the world." At the Beijing Hotel, the September issue of "People's Pictorial" was quickly taken by many foreign friends. They were overjoyed, some holding the pictorial and unwilling to let go, some placing Chairman Mao's portrait by the lamp and bowing in respect, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" A Palestinian friend hung the six photographs of Chairman Mao from the pictorial on his room's door, windows, and walls. He said, "This way, as soon as I open my eyes, I can see Chairman Mao. Seeing Chairman Mao, everything becomes energizing."

Chairman Mao Badges Worn on the Chest, to Let Everyone See

The shining Chairman Mao badges are the most beloved treasures of revolutionary people from various countries. Whenever a Chinese delegation goes abroad, many people point to their chests and shout, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" asking Chinese comrades for Chairman Mao badges.

In the Soviet Union, despite the modern revisionists' intense slander of China and prohibition of people praising Chairman Mao, they still cannot stop the Soviet people's love for Chairman Mao. Recently, when the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe visited the Soviet Union for performances, Chairman Mao badges became the most cherished gifts among the Soviet people. In Moscow, an audience member who received a Chairman Mao badge raised his arm and shouted, "Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Mao Zedong!" In Donetsk, an elderly Soviet driver carefully pinned the Chairman Mao badge on his collar and proudly said, "I wear the Chairman Mao badge on the highest part of my chest, so everyone can see it!"

Wearing Chairman Mao Badges, Hearts Turned to Chairman Mao

Revolutionary people from various countries wear Chairman Mao badges on their chests and their hearts turn to Mao Zedong. They regard Chairman Mao badges as a great source of inspiration for their fighting spirit. Three Lao combat heroes, after wearing Chairman Mao badges, happily said, "The Chairman Mao badge is our best gift. Even in the most intense moments of battle, we must protect it. We will never let anything defile Chairman Mao's image." A Japanese friend, after wearing a Chairman Mao badge, said, "We will wear the Chairman Mao badge on our chests and keep it in our hearts. As long as our hearts beat, we will never forget Chairman Mao." A friend from Congo-Brazzaville, upon receiving a Chairman Mao badge, happily said, "With this Chairman Mao badge, I think of Chairman Mao every day. He is always with us." An Iraqi university student tightly held the Chairman Mao badge to his chest and excitedly said, "I want the beloved Chairman Mao to always be close to my heart, forever guiding me forward!" A university student from Khartoum, Sudan, told a Chinese comrade, "The Chairman Mao badge is the thing I love most. Every time I see it, I gain boundless strength." An Austrian friend wrote to a Chinese comrade, "I always wear the Chairman Mao badge. For me, it serves as a reminder to fight for Marxism-Leninism and against American imperialism."

    天天要看毛主席　时时想着毛主席
    ——各国革命人民热爱毛主席的故事
    本报讯　各国革命人民无限热爱中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席。他们把得到一张毛主席像或一枚毛主席像章看作是一生中的最幸福的事情，看作是激励斗志的巨大鼓舞力量。
    把毛主席像作为传家宝
    “多少日子以来，我就渴望在我的家中能有一张毛主席的像片。他是我们这个时代最光辉的人物，是当代最伟大最英明的马列主义者。毛泽东同志的像，能鼓舞革命者的斗志。我要买最好的镜框把毛主席像镶起来，挂在房中间，作为我家的传家宝，一代一代地传下去。”这是从国外写来的热情洋溢的索取毛主席像的一封信。
    现在，世界各个地方，不断寄来这样充满着对我们伟大领袖无限热爱之情的来信。他们要求得到一张毛主席像片或者一枚毛主席像章。他们把得到这一切看作一生中最幸福的事情。
    看见毛主席，干啥都有劲
    《人民画报》九月特大号刊登了毛主席接见红卫兵的许多照片，还有一张大幅的毛主席的彩色照片。这期画报受到了各国革命者最热烈的欢迎。一位阿根廷朋友来信说：“第九期《人民画报》，多好的一期啊！毛主席的照片美极了，今后每一期画报里都应有毛主席的照片，这对世界来说是极重要的。毛主席的照片会给予全世界无产阶级莫大的鼓励。”在北京饭店，九月号《人民画报》就被许多外国朋友取光了。他们拿到后都兴高采烈，有的捧着画报不肯放，有的把毛主席像靠在台灯上鞠躬致敬，高呼“毛主席万岁！”一位巴勒斯坦朋友把画报上的六张毛主席照片挂在自己房间的门、窗、墙等处。他说：“这样，我一睁开眼就可以看到毛主席。看到毛主席，干什么事都有劲。”
    毛主席像章挂胸前，要让人们都看到
    金光闪闪的毛主席像章是各国革命人民最心爱的宝物。每当中国代表团到国外，总有许多人指着自己胸前，喊：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”向中国同志要毛主席像章。
    在苏联，尽管现代修正主义者大力诬蔑中国，禁止人民赞扬毛主席，但是他们仍然禁止不了苏联人民对毛主席的热爱。不久前，北京歌舞团到苏联访问演出时，毛主席像章成了最受苏联人民欢迎的珍贵礼品。莫斯科一位观众得到了毛主席像章以后，振臂高呼：“中国共产党万岁！毛泽东万岁！”在顿涅茨克，一位苏联老司机把毛主席像章小心翼翼地别在衣领上，自豪地说：“我把毛主席像章挂在胸前最高处，要让人们都能看到！”
    戴上毛主席像章，心向毛主席
    各国革命人民是身戴毛主席像章，心向毛泽东。他们把毛主席像章当作激励他们斗志的巨大的鼓舞力量。有三位老挝战斗英雄戴上毛主席像章后高兴地说：“毛主席像章是我们最好的礼品。就是在战斗紧张的时刻，也要把它保护好，我们决不让任何东西沾污毛主席像。”一位日本朋友挂上毛主席像章后说：“我们要把毛主席像章挂在胸前，印在心中，只要我们的心脏跳动一天，我们就永远不忘记毛主席。”一位刚果（布）的朋友拿到毛主席像章时高兴地说：“我有了这枚毛主席像章，就每天想着毛主席。他同我们永远在一起。”一位伊拉克的大学生把毛主席像章紧紧放在胸口，激动地说：“我要让敬爱的毛主席永远贴着我的心，永远指引着我前进！”苏丹喀土穆一位大学生对中国同志说：“毛主席像章是我最心爱的东西。每当看到它，我就增添了无穷的力量。”一位奥地利朋友写信给中国同志说：“毛主席像章我总戴在身上，对我来讲，它起着督促我为捍卫马列主义、反对美帝国主义而斗争的作用。”
