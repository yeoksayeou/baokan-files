    Not Being Used as Cannon Fodder for American Aggression, Turning Guns on the Enemy
    More and More South Vietnamese Puppet Soldiers Rebel
    Two Puppet Soldiers in Quang Nam Province Kill and Wound Nearly Forty American and Puppet Soldiers Before Defecting

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi - According to a report by the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the recent "sweeping" operation by the American and puppet forces in the Thua Thien province's Thuan Hoa commune was forced to halt due to the resistance of over 2,000 puppet soldiers.

    According to the report, on October 26, as soon as the American and puppet forces arrived in Thuan Hoa commune, they were immediately met with fierce ambushes by local guerrilla forces. The American aggressors, fearing for their lives, forced the puppet soldiers to take the lead, and opened fire on those who refused to be their cannon fodder, killing and wounding over a hundred puppet soldiers.

    On the morning of October 27, the Americans again used helicopters to transport a large number of puppet soldiers to Thuan Hoa commune in an attempt to continue the "sweeping" operation. However, the reinforcements saw their fallen comrades lying on the ground and, in a fit of rage, refused to participate in the "sweeping" and demanded to be immediately sent back to the base. Due to the resistance of over 2,000 puppet soldiers, the American commander had no choice but to halt the operation.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 13 - According to a report by the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the barbaric crimes committed by the American aggressors in South Vietnam have sparked strong indignation among some patriotic soldiers in the puppet army. Recently, two puppet soldiers in Quang Nam province successively turned their guns on the enemy, killing and wounding nearly forty American and puppet soldiers, and then joined the liberation forces.

    On September 26, a group of American and puppet forces launched a "sweeping" operation in several communes in Dien Ban district, Quang Nam province.

    The American aggressors' barbaric acts of burning, killing, and looting the local people during the "sweeping" operation aroused the righteous indignation of the puppet soldiers. One soldier immediately turned his gun on the American aggressors and fired fiercely, killing twenty-four enemies and wounding seven. Subsequently, this patriotic soldier joined the liberation forces.

    On October 27, a puppet soldier in Tam Ky district, Quang Nam province, used a hand grenade to kill five commanding officers and wound three, and together with twenty other soldiers, surrendered to the people.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi - According to a report by the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, as the liberation forces in South Vietnam continue to achieve victories, more and more puppet soldiers are rebelling and turning their guns on the enemy.

    A part of the puppet soldiers stationed in Chau Duc and Ong Cong districts in Binh Dinh province staged rebellions on October 5 and 16, respectively, and cooperated with the liberation forces to annihilate an entire enemy platoon, seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

    In the first nine months of this year, there were thirty-six rebellions among the puppet soldiers stationed in Ninh Thuan and Tay Ninh provinces, killing 131 American aggressors and puppet military officers.

    The rebelling puppet soldiers also cooperated with the liberation forces to capture four forts, annihilate two puppet platoons, and seize many weapons.

    Due to the increasing scale of puppet soldiers' rebellions, many puppet army units have suffered severe shortages. For example, each battalion of the puppet army's 25th Division has only 160 to 190 soldiers. Many puppet companies have only 40 to 50 soldiers.

    不当美帝侵略炮灰　掉转枪口打击敌人
    南越伪军起义越来越多
    广南省两名伪军毙伤近四十名美伪军后弃暗投明
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，美伪集团不久前对朔庄省同兴乡发动的“扫荡”，由于遭到两千多名伪军的抗拒而不得不停止下来。
    据报道，十月二十六日，美伪军刚刚开到同兴乡，立即遭到当地游击队的猛烈截击。美国侵略军因为怕死，就迫使伪军打头阵，并向不愿意为他们充当炮灰的伪军进行扫射，打死打伤伪军一百多人。
    二十七日上午，美国人又用直升飞机增运大批伪军到同兴乡妄图继续进行“扫荡”。但是前来增援的伪军一看到他们死去的同伴躺在地上，就怒不可遏地拒绝进行“扫荡”，并要求把他们立即送回基地。由于两千多名伪军的反抗，美国指挥官不得不中止了这次“扫荡”。
    新华社河内十三日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，美国侵略者在南越犯下的野蛮罪行，激起了伪军中一些爱国士兵的强烈愤慨。广南省最近有两个伪军士兵先后掉转枪口，打死打伤美伪军近四十名，然后投奔解放武装力量。
    九月二十六日，一批美伪军向广南省奠盘县的一些乡进行“扫荡”。
    美国侵略强盗在“扫荡”中，肆意烧杀虏掠当地人民的野蛮罪行，激起了伪军士兵的义愤，其中一个士兵当即掉转枪口，向美国强盗猛烈射击，打死敌人二十四名，打伤七名。
    随后，这个爱国士兵便投奔解放武装力量。
    十月二十七日，广南省三岐县的一名伪军，用手榴弹炸死指挥官五名，炸伤三名，同另外二十名士兵一起，向人民投诚。
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，在越南南方解放武装力量的节节胜利下，越来越多的伪军士兵举行起义，掉转枪口打击敌人。
    驻扎在槟椥省周城县和翁宗县的伪军中的一部分爱国士兵，在十月五日和十六日相继举行起义，配合解放武装力量全歼敌人一个排，并且缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    驻扎在新安和堤岸两省的伪军，在今年头九个月内发生了三十六起起义事件，共打死美国侵略军和伪军军官一百三十一名。
    起义的伪军士兵还配合解放武装力量攻克了四座碉堡，全歼伪军两个排，缴获了许多武器。
    由于伪军士兵起义的规模越来越大，致使伪军许多部队大量缺额，例如伪军第二十五师每个营只有一百六十到一百九十人。许多伪军连只有四十到五十名士兵。
