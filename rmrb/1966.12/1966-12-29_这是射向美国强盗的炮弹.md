Our country's Eastern Song and Dance Troupe recently visited and performed in Vietnam. In addition to holding large-scale performances, they also organized several "Red Lantern" style performance teams, bringing song and dance art full of fighting spirit to Vietnam's factories, rural areas, and people's military front lines. The female performers each carried a sewing kit, and upon arriving at the front lines, in addition to performing, they also helped the soldiers mend their clothes. The Vietnamese soldiers were moved and said, "Every stitch and thread you sew connects the brotherly feelings between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples." After watching the performances of "Destroy the Strategic Hamlets," "Yankee, Get Out of Here," "Spring in the Battle Zone," and "Liberate the South," the soldiers were moved and said, "This is not acting, this is real life. Watching it makes me want to pick up my gun and fight!" They called the performances by the Eastern Song and Dance Troupe "flowers of Sino-Vietnamese friendship" and "shells fired at the American bandits."

    这是射向美国强盗的炮弹
    我国东方歌舞团不久前到越南访问演出时，除了举行大规模的公演之外，还组织了几个“乌兰牧骑”式的演出队，把充满战斗气息的歌舞艺术送到越南的工厂、农村和人民军阵地。女演员们随身都带着一个针线包，到了阵地上，除演出之外，还帮助战士们缝补衣服。越南人民军战士们激动地说：“你们的一针一线都连结着越中两国人民的兄弟之情。”战士们看了《捣毁战略村》、《美国佬滚出去》、《战区的春天》和《解放南方》等歌舞后，激动地说：“这不是演戏，这是真实的生活。我看了它，就想拿起枪来战斗！”他们把东方歌舞团的演出称作“中越友谊花朵”，称作“射向美国强盗的炮弹”。
