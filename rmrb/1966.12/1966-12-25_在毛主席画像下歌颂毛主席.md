There were two Belgian friends, a couple, who came to visit China. They often heard the Chinese people singing "The East Is Red" and were very eager to learn to sing this song in Chinese to praise the great leader Chairman Mao.

A Chinese comrade found a record of "The East Is Red" for them, with the lyrics phonetically transcribed in their language, and taught them how to sing it. They were overjoyed and immediately began to learn it seriously, phrase by phrase. After practicing more than ten times, they finally mastered it. At this point, they straightened their clothes, solemnly walked to a large portrait of Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically sang the song in unison to praise Chairman Mao.

    在毛主席画像下歌颂毛主席
    有两位来中国访问的比利时朋友，是一对夫妇。他们听到中国人民常常唱《东方红》，非常想学会用中文来唱这支歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲。
    一个中国同志替他们找来了《东方红》的歌片，歌词用外文拼上音，教他们唱。他们高兴极了，马上一句一句认真地学。学了十多遍，终于学会了。这时，他们整了整衣服，严肃地走到一张毛主席的巨幅画像下面，热情地齐声高唱起这支歌颂毛主席的歌子。
