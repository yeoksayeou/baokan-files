The people of Quang Tri and Thua Thien provinces in South Vietnam have been waging a vigorous guerrilla war since the beginning of this year, inflicting heavy losses on the American aggressors and their lackeys, and achieving brilliant victories. The American bandits are increasingly being engulfed in the flames of guerrilla warfare in Quang Tri and Thua Thien.

By the end of October this year, the people of Quang Tri and Thua Thien had annihilated 20,000 enemy troops, including more than 5,300 American aggressors. Among the American troops annihilated were two entire battalions, nine companies, and 39 platoons. Compared to 1965, the number of American troops annihilated has increased 23-fold. The people of the two provinces have also destroyed many of the enemy's important military strongholds, and the liberated areas have expanded unprecedentedly, including a population of 360,000. Many places have formed solid bases.

The Thua Thien provincial guerrilla forces have formed a powerful encirclement around the Phu Bai American military base, about 20 kilometers from Hue City, tightening the noose around the necks of the American bandits. The guerrilla forces' elusive activities have dealt heavy blows to the enemy at the Phu Bai base.

The activities of the guerrilla forces have tied down a large part of the American Marine Corps forces at the Phu Bai base, making it difficult for the American bandits to turn the situation around, even though they have poured in tens of battalions into Quang Tri and Thua Thien.

Destroying and attacking the enemy's supply lines, and cutting off Highway No. 1 and the railway for an extended period, have been notable achievements of the Quang Tri and Thua Thien guerrilla forces this year. The guerrilla forces have destroyed enemy roads, blown up bridges, and attacked enemy convoys, ships, and outposts near bridges and roads, putting the enemy in a very passive state. The enemy is busy everywhere, adjusting troops to deal with the situation, which has created good opportunities for the liberation army to annihilate the enemy.

To cope with the increasingly vigorous guerrilla warfare in Quang Tri and Thua Thien, the American bandits and their lackeys have launched one "sweeping" operation after another, crazily attacking the liberated areas. The guerrilla forces in Quang Tri and Thua Thien, in coordination with the main forces and local forces, have actively and proactively consumed the enemy's combat forces. Just this summer, the guerrilla forces in Quang Tri and Thua Thien launched more than 400 battles in various places, annihilating more than 1,000 enemy troops.

The guerrilla forces, armed with simple weapons and those seized from the enemy, have flexibly employed the strategies and tactics of people's war, actively attacking the enemy, surrounding and assaulting the enemy, forcing the enemy to withdraw from some strongholds and outposts, and making the enemy divide their forces to deal with the situation. While attacking the enemy, the guerrilla forces have also smashed the enemy's puppet administrative organs and expanded the liberated areas.

    灵活运用人民战争战略战术　主动消灭敌人的有生力量
    南越广治承天两省军民大打游击战
    据新华社河内二十四日电　据越南通讯社报道：今年以来，越南南方北部的广治和承天两省的游击战争蓬勃发展，广大军民痛歼美国侵略者及其走狗，取得了辉煌的战功。美国强盗愈来愈被淹没在广治、承天游击战争的火海中。
    到今年十月底为止，广治、承天军民歼灭的二万名敌军中，有五千三百多名美国侵略者，其中包括全歼美军两个营、九个连和三十九个排。同一九六五年比较，被歼美军增加了二十三倍。两省军民还拔除了敌人许多重要军事据点，解放区已空前扩大，包括有三十六万人口，许多地方已形成稳固的根据地。
    承天省游击队在离顺化市约二十公里的芙拜美军基地周围，形成了一个强大的歼美包围圈，把套在芙拜美国强盗脖子上的绞索越拉越紧。游击队展开的神出鬼没的活动，给芙拜基地的敌人以沉重的打击。
    游击队的活动牵制了芙拜基地美国海军陆战队的大部分力量，使美国强盗虽然在广治、承天投进成十个营兵力，但仍然不能扭转局面。
    破坏和袭击敌人交通线，长期切断一号公路和铁路是广治、承天游击队今年的显著成绩之一。游击队破坏敌人公路、炸毁桥梁，同时袭击敌人车队、战船和进攻桥梁、公路附近的哨所，使敌人陷于十分被动的状态，到处忙于调兵应付，这就为解放军创造了歼敌的良机。
    美国强盗及其走狗为了对付广治、承天日益蓬勃发展的游击战争运动，它们接二连三地展开了“扫荡”，疯狂地进攻解放区。广治、承天游击队配合主力部队和地方部队积极、主动地消耗敌人的有生力量。仅今年夏季，广治、承天游击队就在各地展开了四百次战斗，消灭敌人一千多名。
    游击队以简陋的和从敌人手中夺来的武器，灵活地运用人民战争的战略、战术，主动地袭击敌人，包围、进攻敌人，强迫敌人撤出一些据点和哨所，迫使敌人分兵对付。游击队在进攻敌人的同时，还粉碎敌伪统治机构，扩大解放区。（附图片）
