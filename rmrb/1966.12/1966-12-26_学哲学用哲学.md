The comrades from a reconnaissance platoon in a certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region have shared some profound insights. They say: To maintain a clear mind in the sharp and complex class struggle, one must study and master Chairman Mao's philosophical thoughts. Only in this way can one see clearly and stand firmly.

Our great teacher, Chairman Mao, has repeatedly instructed us: We must study materialism and dialectics, strive to avoid subjectivism and one-sidedness, and oppose metaphysics and pedantic philosophy. Chairman Mao is the greatest philosopher, and his philosophical thoughts represent the highest level of Marxist philosophy. We must study them seriously.

Some comrades are intimidated by the word "philosophy," as if it is always profound and incomprehensible, beyond reach. In reality, this is a trick played by those bourgeois "authorities." Philosophy originally comes from the practical experiences of the working people in class struggle and production struggle. It is easiest for the working people to learn and understand. Those so-called "philosophical authorities" have created many obscure and pedantic philosophies, distorting it into a tool to deceive and oppress the working people. Now, we must break these superstitions, thoroughly criticize bourgeois philosophy, and smash it to pieces! At the same time, we must vigorously promote proletarian philosophy and Chairman Mao's philosophical thoughts.

How do we study philosophy? The comrades from the reconnaissance platoon have also provided us with good experiences. That is, by closely grasping the two characteristics of Marxist philosophy—its class nature and practicality—we can conduct our studies. We must constantly engage in the struggle to eliminate private interests and establish public interests, to destroy the bourgeoisie and promote the proletariat, and firmly stand on the side of the proletariat. At the same time, we must connect our studies with actual practice, integrating class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments. By seizing this key to learning, the comrades from the reconnaissance platoon have been able to study and apply Chairman Mao's philosophical thoughts effectively in their struggles. They have learned well and applied them well.

    学哲学用哲学
    立影
    南京部队某部侦察连同志们写的体会很深刻。他们说：要使自己在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中永远保持清醒的头脑，就要学习和掌握毛主席的哲学思想。只有这样，才能看得清，站得稳。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席一再教导我们：要学习唯物论和辩证法，要努力避免主观主义和片面性，要反对形而上学和烦琐哲学。毛主席是最伟大的哲学家，毛主席的哲学思想是最高水平的马克思主义哲学，我们必须认真学习。
    有些同志听到“哲学”这两个字就有点害怕，好像哲学总是深奥难懂、高不可攀的东西。其实，这是上了那些资产阶级“权威”老爷们的当了。哲学本来是从劳动人民参加阶级斗争生产斗争的实践中总结出来的道理，劳动人民最容易学，最容易懂。那些哲学“权威”们搞了许多晦涩难懂的烦琐哲学，把它歪曲成为欺骗和压迫劳动人民的工具。我们现在就要破除迷信，大破资产阶级哲学，把它打个稀巴烂！同时就要大学无产阶级哲学，大学毛主席的哲学思想。
    怎样学哲学？侦察连的同志们也给我们提供了好经验，那就是紧紧抓住马克思主义哲学的阶级性和实践性这两个特点，进行学习。不断地进行破私立公、灭资兴无的思想斗争，坚定地站到无产阶级的立场上来；同时又一定要联系实际，结合阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，活学活用。侦察连的同志们抓紧这个学习关键，在斗争中活学活用毛主席的哲学思想，他们就学得好，用得好。
