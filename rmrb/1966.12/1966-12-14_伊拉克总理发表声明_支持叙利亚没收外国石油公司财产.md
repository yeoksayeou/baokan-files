Iraqi Prime Minister Naji Talib issued a statement on December 10, reaffirming the Iraqi government's support for Syria's stance and legitimate demands regarding the "Iraq Petroleum Company," which is owned by American, British, French, and Dutch capital.

On December 8, the Syrian government seized all the assets of this foreign oil company in Syria as compensation for the company's unreasonable delay in paying Syria's transit oil taxes. The Syrian government also announced an increase in transit taxes for foreign oil.

Talib made the statement after learning that the oil company had stopped transporting Iraqi oil from the Syrian port of Baniyas. Prior to this, he had chaired a special cabinet meeting to discuss the situation.

In his statement following the meeting, Talib said that Syria's seizure of the "Iraq Petroleum Company's" assets in Syria should not be used as a reason to disrupt the flow of Iraqi oil or reduce its export volume.

The statement said: The Iraqi government has formally notified the company that the Iraqi government will not ignore the losses caused to Iraq by the company's deliberate actions. The statement also said that even if the company reduces or completely stops transporting oil through the pipeline to Syria, the Iraqi government retains the right to collect all taxes from the company.

    伊拉克总理发表声明
    支持叙利亚没收外国石油公司财产
    据新华社巴格达十日电　伊拉克总理纳吉·塔列布十日发表声明，重申伊拉克政府支持叙利亚对美、英、法、荷资本拥有的“伊拉克石油公司”采取的立场和提出的正当要求。
    叙利亚政府在八日没收了这家外国石油公司在叙利亚的全部财产，作为这家公司无理拖欠叙利亚过境石油税的抵偿，并宣布提高外国石油的过境税。
    塔列布总理是在获悉这家石油公司已停止从叙利亚的巴尼亚斯港运输伊拉克石油后发表这一声明的。在这以前，他曾主持一次特别内阁会议，研究这一局势。
    塔列布在会后发表的声明说，叙利亚政府没收“伊拉克石油公司”在叙利亚的财产不能成为中断伊拉克石油流通或降低它的输出量的理由。
    声明说：伊拉克政府已经正式通知这家公司，伊拉克政府决不会对这家公司蓄意采取的立场而给伊拉克造成的损失置之不理。声明还说，即使这家公司减少或完全停止通过油管向叙利亚输送石油，伊拉克政府依然保留向这家公司征收全部税款的权利。
