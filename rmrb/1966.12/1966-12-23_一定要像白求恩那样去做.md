	Recently, a delegation from the Uruguayan-Chinese Cultural Association visited our country. During their tour of various places, Chinese comrades asked the Uruguayan friends if they had any suggestions regarding the itinerary. The oldest member of the delegation immediately raised a point: "I am satisfied with everything, but there is one thing I would like to mention: there was no time allocated for studying Chairman Mao's works." His suggestion was immediately endorsed by the other Uruguayan friends.

	Several days later, this Uruguayan friend fell ill. In the evening, Chinese comrades went to visit him and found him lying in bed, deeply engrossed in reading Chairman Mao's essay "In Memory of Norman Bethune." As soon as he saw the Chinese comrades, he exclaimed, "What a wonderful passage!" The Chinese comrades were puzzled, but the friend immediately recited, word for word, "Comrade Bethune's spirit of complete selflessness and devotion to the people is shown in his extreme dedication to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people..." It turned out that he was deeply moved by this passage from Chairman Mao.

	After recovering from his illness, this friend continued to enthusiastically study Chairman Mao's works during the visit. In the final days of the visit, he repeatedly requested that the Chinese comrades find him Spanish translations of the "Three Articles." At the farewell, he spoke about why he held such deep affection for the "Three Articles." He said, "During my visit to China, one of the deepest impressions I gained was witnessing the great spiritual strength of the Chinese people. Here, everyone connects themselves with the world revolution, which is unparalleled in the world." He then excitedly declared, "My greatest gain is that I have learned a bit of the spirit of Norman Bethune in China. After returning home, I will definitely strive to act like Norman Bethune."

    一定要像白求恩那样去做
    不久前，乌拉圭中国文化协会代表团来我国访问。在各地参观的旅途中，中国同志征求乌拉圭朋友们对旅程安排有什么意见。代表团中一位年龄最长的乌拉圭朋友马上提出：“我对什么都满意，可就是有一点意见：没有给我留下学习毛主席著作的时间。”他的意见，立刻得到了其他乌拉圭朋友的同意。
    几天以后，这位乌拉圭朋友病倒了。晚上，中国同志去探望他，只见他躺在床上正专心地阅读毛主席的《纪念白求恩》这篇文章。他一见中国同志，劈头一句话就说：“这话说得多好啊！”中国同志听了正摸不着头脑，紧接着这位朋友马上一字一句认真地念道：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。……”原来，他是被毛主席的这段话深深感动了。
    这位朋友病愈以后，在访问途中一直热情地学习着毛主席著作。到访问快结束的那几天，他一再要求中国同志替他找一些“老三篇”的西班牙文译本。在告别时，他谈了自己为什么对“老三篇”那样无限热爱。他说，这是因为“在中国访问期间，最深的感受之一是见到了中国人民伟大的精神力量。在这里，每一个人都把自己同世界革命联结在一起，这是世界上无与伦比的。”接着，他又激动地表示：“我自己最大的收获是在中国学了一点白求恩精神。回国以后，我一定要像白求恩那样去做。”
