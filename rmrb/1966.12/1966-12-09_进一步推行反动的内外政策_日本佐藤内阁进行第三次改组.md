	Further Implementing Reactionary Domestic and Foreign Policies
	The Sato Cabinet Conducts Its Third Reshuffle

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 5th, Tokyo: On the 3rd, Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku conducted his third cabinet reshuffle since taking office more than two years ago. The composition of the new cabinet indicates that it will further serve U.S. imperialism's aggressive war policies in Vietnam and Asia in foreign affairs, while in domestic politics, it will further move towards reactionary policies and the exploitation of the laboring people.

	Among the nineteen cabinet members, Sato, Kishi Nobusuke, Ishii, and those following Sato's Three Wood faction together occupy twelve seats, with Sato's faction alone controlling six seats. Other factions that entered the cabinet also support Sato. In the Liberal Democratic Party's election for party president on the 1st, those who supported Fujiyama Aikichi, such as the Fujiyama faction and Matsumura faction, did not have a single member enter the cabinet.

	On the 5th, Sato Eisaku said at a press conference that the new cabinet will continue to regard the close alliance between Japan and the United States as the foundation of its foreign policy, and that the "Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" system will not undergo any changes. A report from Kyodo News in Washington said: U.S. officials believe that the "pro-American line of the new cabinet is unshakable."

	After the formation of Sato's new cabinet, it immediately faced condemnation and opposition from various sectors of Japanese society. Dongfang News Agency pointed out that the Sato cabinet is increasingly facing strong opposition from the Japanese people, and it is attempting to find a way out by further consolidating the leadership of the right-wing.

    进一步推行反动的内外政策
    日本佐藤内阁进行第三次改组
    据新华社五日讯　东京消息：日本首相佐藤荣作三日进行了他上台两年多来的第三次内阁改组。新内阁的组成表明，它在外交上将进一步为美帝国主义侵略越南和亚洲的战争政策效劳，同时，在内政上将进一步趋向反动和压榨劳动人民。
    在十九名阁员中，佐藤、岸信介、石井等右派和跟着佐藤走的三木派共占十二个席位，其中仅佐藤一派就控制了六个席位。其他派系入阁的也都是支持佐藤的。在一日的自由民主党竞选总裁大会上支持藤山爱一郎的藤山派、松村派等没有一个人参加内阁。
    佐藤荣作五日在记者招待会上说，新内阁将继续把日本同美国的密切的联盟视为它的外交政策的基础，日美“安全条约”体制不会有任何变化。共同社发自华盛顿的消息说：美国有关人士认为，“新内阁亲美路线的基调是坚定不移的”。
    佐藤的新内阁组成后立即遭到日本各界人士的谴责和反对。东方通讯社指出，佐藤内阁日益受到日本人民的强烈反对，它企图依靠进一步确立右派领导权的办法来寻找出路。
