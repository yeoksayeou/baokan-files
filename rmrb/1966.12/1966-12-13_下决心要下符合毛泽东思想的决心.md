	To Resolve to Make a Decision, Not to Fear Sacrifice, To Overcome All Difficulties, and To Strive for Victory
	The comrades of the well-digging team in Changzi County, Shanxi, in the process of fighting against nature, actively studied and applied the "Three Articles," focusing on studying Chairman Mao's teaching: "Resolve to make a decision, not to fear sacrifice, to overcome all difficulties, and to strive for victory." They used this teaching to guide their thoughts and actions, achieving remarkable results. The following are some of their speeches at the study session.

	Resolve to Make a Decision in Accordance with Mao Zedong Thought
		Guǒcūn Commune Guidance Officer

	Our well-digging team went to Songjiazhuang Brigade to dig a well. We heard the masses say: "Digging a well in the sand, one dig and it becomes a black hole." Many people heard this and said: "Never mind, this is probably the opinion of backward masses. We just do our job!" At that time, I thought: perhaps the masses' words have some basis. Because in this regard, we have had lessons. In the previous period, when we dug a well in Guocun Brigade, because we did not conduct thorough investigation and research, did not understand the underground water source and the structure of the strata, we simply determined the well position and started digging. As a result, we wasted a lot of effort, dug more than five zhang deep, and still did not see water. Later, after an investigation, we found out that we had chosen the well position on a high bank, the water level was deep, and the water volume was insufficient. This incident made us realize: to resolve to make a decision, it must be the right decision, a decision in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought. If we do not follow Chairman Mao's instructions, make decisions recklessly, or make wrong decisions, the bigger the decision, the worse it will be. With this question in mind, we studied Chairman Mao's works.

	Chairman Mao said: "The correct deployment of the commander comes from the correct decision, the correct decision comes from the correct judgment, the correct judgment comes from thorough and necessary reconnaissance, and the comprehensive thinking of various reconnaissance materials." Based on Chairman Mao's instructions, we first went deep into the masses to conduct investigation and research. It turned out that this brigade had dug a quicksand well a few years ago, and it failed because it did not use pressurized water to control the quicksand. Thus, under the inspiration of the decision "a quicksand well must be dug," we adopted the method of adding pressurized water and pouring red clay soil into the well. By fully exerting human subjective initiative, treating the digging of a quicksand well as going to the battlefield to fight the enemy, the result was that in just three days, this quicksand well was completed.

专栏：活学活用“老三篇”讲用会

    下定决心  不怕牺牲  排队万难  去争取胜利
    山西长子县打井专业队的同志们，在同大自然作斗争的过程中，活学活用“老三篇”，着重学习了毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这一条语录，用这条语录来指导自己的思想和行动，取得了显著的效果。这里刊登的是他们在讲用会上的几篇发言。
    下决心要下符合毛泽东思想的决心	郭村公社指导员	李文先
    我们打井分队到宋家庄大队打井。听到群众说：“沙滩打机井，一打一个黑窟窿。”许多人听了以后都说：“管他呢，这恐怕是落后群众的意见。咱们只管干吧！”当时我想：群众这些说法或许是有根据的。因为在这方面，我们有过教训。前个时期，我们在郭村大队打井时，因为事先没有周密的调查研究，没有摸清地下水的来龙去脉和地层的结构，就定好井位打起来。结果，误了许多工，打了五丈多深，还不见水。后来一调查，才知道我们把井位选在一个高岸上了，水位很深，水量不足。这件事使我们认识到：下定决心，必须是下定正确的决心，下定符合毛泽东思想的决心。如果不照毛主席的指示，乱下决心，错下决心，决心越大越糟糕。我们带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。
    毛主席说：“指挥员的正确的部署来源于正确的决心，正确的决心来源于正确的判断，正确的判断来源于周到的和必要的侦察，和对于各种侦察材料的联贯起来的思索。”我们根据毛主席这个教导，就先深入到群众中去进行调查研究。原来这个大队前几年打流沙井，因为没有加压力水去制服流沙而失败了。于是，我们在“非打成流沙井不可”的决心鼓舞下，采取了增添压力水，往井里倒红胶泥土的办法。由于充分发挥人的主观能动作用，把打流沙井当成上战场打敌人，结果，只用了三天，这眼流沙井就打成了。
