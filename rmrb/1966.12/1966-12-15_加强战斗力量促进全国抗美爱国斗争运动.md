The Lao People's Patriotic Front and the Patriotic Neutralist Forces Political Consultative Conference Propose Six Points

Strengthen Combat Forces to Promote National Anti-American Patriotic Struggle

It is necessary to further strengthen the alliance between the Lao People's Patriotic Front and the Patriotic Neutralist Forces. Strongly condemn the U.S. for escalating its insane war in Vietnam and its "peace talks" deception.

KANGO, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao Radio, the Lao People's Patriotic Front and the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces recently held a political consultative conference.

A communiqué issued by the conference exposed that while the U.S. imperialists were gradually escalating their war of aggression against Vietnam and conducting military provocations against the Kingdom of Cambodia, they were also intensifying their "special war" against Laos to realize their plot of expanding their war of aggression against the Indochina Peninsula. They are desperately preparing military and political conditions to send U.S. ground troops to directly occupy the central and southern regions of Laos, in an attempt to salvage their heavy defeats suffered in Laos and South Vietnam.

The communiqué, in discussing the internal contradictions within the Vientiane regime, pointed out: The contradictions within the puppet government and puppet army are becoming increasingly sharp. Hidden contradictions and power struggles among various pro-American factions and military cliques have led to the "National Assembly" in Vientiane voting against the government of Souphanouvong, and the puppet government in turn dissolving the puppet "National Assembly." Coups are occurring one after another. This situation further increases the instability and weakness of the puppet government and army, creating many difficulties for the U.S. in realizing its plot to expand its war of aggression against our country.

The communiqué said, "The conference unanimously agreed that over the past year, the patriotic forces and people of Laos have overcome many difficulties and achieved new and major victories. The most significant victory is the continuous consolidation and development of the national united front. Most importantly, the alliance between the Lao People's Patriotic Front and the Patriotic Neutralist Forces has become increasingly solid. The two forces have correctly implemented the principles of the alliance, becoming increasingly united and unified in politics and action. Both sides' forces continue to be consolidated and grow."

The communiqué said, based on the current tasks of the patriotic forces and people of Laos, the conference proposed the following six points:

1. Develop the anti-American patriotic struggle into a more powerful political force. As the strong core force of the national united front against American imperialism, the alliance between the Lao People's Patriotic Front and the Patriotic Neutralist Forces must be further strengthened.

2. Further carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and tenacious fighting will of the people in the liberated areas, further promote production, develop the economy and culture, improve living conditions, foil all new attacks and encroachments by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, defend the liberated areas, and build the liberated areas into a strong base for the long-term struggle of the people throughout the country.

3. While strengthening the construction of the main forces, actively build and further widely develop local forces and guerrilla units, further promote and expand the guerrilla warfare movement, so as to mobilize the entire nation to participate in the fight to defend the homeland.

4. Further promote the national anti-American patriotic struggle movement, especially organizing and mobilizing the people in the areas controlled by the pro-American regime to participate more widely in political struggles.

5. Actively seek the broader and more powerful spiritual and material support of friends from all over the world, first and foremost the peoples of the Indochina countries and the Asian countries.

6. Vigorously support the movement of the peoples of the world against imperialism and for the defense of peace, and use all means to support the struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national independence. In particular, it is necessary to wholeheartedly support the just struggles of the Vietnamese people and the Cambodian people, strengthen the fighting unity with the peoples of these two brotherly countries, and coordinate actions to defeat the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression against Indochina. It is particularly necessary to pay close attention to and actively support the patriotic struggle movement of the Thai people.

The communiqué said: The conference strongly condemns the U.S. for escalating its insane war in Vietnam and its "peace talks" deception, and once again reaffirms the complete support of the Lao people for the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The conference strongly condemns the despicable war provocations by the U.S. and its South Vietnamese and Thai lackey cliques against the Kingdom of Cambodia, and once again reaffirms the complete support of the Lao people for the firm and correct stance of the people and government of the Kingdom of Cambodia in maintaining the sovereignty, independence, neutrality, and territorial integrity of their country.

The communiqué said: The Lao people regard the promotion of their anti-American patriotic struggle as the most practical support for the struggle of the peoples of the Indochina countries, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the peoples of the world who love peace, against their common enemy.

The communiqué also said: The conference strongly condemns and opposes the lackey cliques, under the plot of the U.S., to hold so-called "elections" in the coming period to manufacture a new puppet National Assembly and government in Vientiane, which is completely illegal, undemocratic, and ineffective.

The Lao People's Patriotic Front and the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces Political Consultative Conference was held from November 21 to 27, 1966, in the liberated areas.

    老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量政治协商会议提出六点主张
    加强战斗力量促进全国抗美爱国斗争运动
    必须进一步增强老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量的联盟  强烈谴责美国对越南的疯狂战争“升级”行动和“和谈”骗局
    新华社康开十三日电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝爱国战线党和老挝爱国中立力量最近举行了政治协商会议。
    会议发表的一项公报揭露美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中“逐步升级”和对柬埔寨王国进行军事挑衅的同时，也加强了对老挝的“特种战争”，以实现其扩大对印度支那地区的侵略战争的阴谋。它竭力在军事和政治方面准备条件，妄图派遣美国陆军直接攻占中下寮地区，妄图挽救它在老挝及越南南方连续遭到的惨重失败。
    公报在谈到万象当局内部矛盾时指出：伪政权、伪军内部的矛盾日益尖锐。各个亲美派之间、各个军阀集团之间的隐蔽矛盾和争夺军权的事件，导致万象“国民议会”投票不赞成梭发那·富马“政府”，反过来傀儡政府又解散傀儡“国民议会”。兵变事件接连发生。这种情况进一步增加了走狗政权和军队的不稳定性和软弱性，为美国实现扩大对我国的侵略战争阴谋造成了许多困难。
    公报说，“会议一致认为，一年来，老挝爱国力量和人民克服了许多困难，取得了新的、重大的胜利。具有头等重大意义的胜利，是民族团结阵线不断得到巩固和发展。尤其重要的是，老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量之间的联盟日益牢固。两种力量正确地执行了各项联盟原则，日益团结，在政治和行动上得到统一。双方的队伍继续得到巩固和日益成长。”
    公报说，会议根据老挝爱国力量和人民的当前任务，提出以下六点主张：
    一、把抗美爱国斗争事业中的全民团结阵线，发展成为更加强大的政治力量。作为抗美爱国全民团结阵线的坚强核心力量，老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量的联盟必须进一步增强。
    二、进一步发扬解放区军民自力更生精神和顽强的战斗意志，进一步促进生产，发展经济和文化，改善生活，粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗一切新的进攻和蚕食计划，保卫解放区，把解放区建设成为全国人民长期斗争的坚强根据地。
    三、在加强对主力部队建设的同时，积极建设和进一步广泛发展地方部队和民兵游击队，进一步促进和扩大游击战争运动，以便动员全民参加保家卫国的战斗。
    四、进一步促进全国的抗美爱国斗争运动，特别是组织和动员亲美政权控制地区人民更加广泛地参加政治斗争。
    五、积极争取全世界朋友，首先是印度支那各国和亚洲各国人民在精神和物质上的更广泛和更有力的同情和支持。
    六、大力支持世界人民反对帝国主义、保卫和平的运动，用一切方法来支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立的一切斗争。特别是要全心全意支持越南人民和柬埔寨人民的正义斗争，增强同这两个兄弟国家人民的战斗团结，密切配合行动，打败美帝国主义对印度支那的侵略战争。特别要密切关心和积极支持泰国人民的爱国斗争运动。
    公报说：会议强烈谴责美国对越南的疯狂战争“升级”行动和它的“和平谈判”骗局，再一次重申老挝人民完全支持越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。会议强烈谴责美国及其南越和泰国走狗集团对柬埔寨王国进行的卑鄙的战争挑衅行动，再一次重申老挝人民完全支持柬埔寨王国人民和政府旨在维护祖国的主权、独立、中立和领土完整所采取的坚决和正确立场。
    公报说，老挝人民把促进自己的抗美爱国斗争，看作是对印度支那各国人民，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民反对共同敌人的斗争事业的最切实的支持。
    公报还说：会议强烈谴责和反对走狗集团根据美国的阴谋，在即将到来的期间内进行目的在于炮制新的万象傀儡国民议会和政府的所谓“普选”，这是完全非法、反民主的和无效的。
    老挝爱国战线党和老挝爱国中立力量政治协商会议是一九六六年十一月二十一日到二十七日在解放区召开的。
