On the afternoons of November 30 and December 1, U.S. military aircraft carried out two consecutive savage air raids on Chinese fishing boats in the public waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. Six of our fishing boats were sunk, and 46 of our fishermen were killed or injured. This is a most serious act of war provocation by the evil U.S. imperialists against the great Chinese people. The Chinese people are greatly indignant about this and have issued the most serious warning and the strongest protest to the U.S. government.

The U.S. imperialists have repeatedly provoked wars against China. This is not an isolated incident. Currently, the U.S. is escalating its aggression in Vietnam. The U.S. imperialists aim to expand the war to China, to launch armed aggression against China, and to challenge China. This policy has been decided long ago. The "peace" rhetoric of the Johnson administration towards China is nothing but a smokescreen to deceive people.

China is a great socialist country armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese people, holding high the great banner of revolution, resolutely oppose imperialism, all reactionaries, and modern revisionism, and resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. They also resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all countries in the world. Therefore, the U.S. imperialists regard socialist China as the biggest obstacle to their policy of aggression and war, seeing it as their biggest enemy, and are determined to use all means, including war, to strangle China.

The Chinese people are irreconcilable with U.S. imperialism. The war provocations by U.S. imperialism can only further inspire the Chinese people to resolve to fight to the end with China's sworn enemy and the number one enemy of all peoples of the world. The blood debts owed by U.S. imperialism to the Chinese people must be thoroughly settled and fully repaid. The bloody crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people must absolutely not be forgiven!

Chairman Mao said, "Our policy is also decided long ago, that is, to counterattack." The Chinese people have no illusions about U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people have long been prepared. We are now on high alert. The unprecedented, massive, and magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in our country is also the best and greatest form of preparedness. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will certainly smash any act of aggression by U.S. imperialism. All war plans of U.S. imperialism will be thoroughly foiled.

    誓同美帝国主义斗争到底
    本报评论员
    十一月三十日下午和十二月一日下午，美国军用飞机连续两次对在北部湾公海捕鱼的我国渔船，进行疯狂的轰炸。我国渔船六艘被炸沉，我渔民四十六人被炸死炸伤。这是万恶的美帝国主义向伟大的中国人民发动的一次极为严重的战争挑衅。中国人民对此表示巨大的愤慨，并且向美国政府提出最严重的警告和最强烈的抗议。
    美帝国主义一次又一次地向中国进行战争挑衅，这决不是偶然的现象，这决不是孤立的事件。目前，美国正在加紧扩大侵略越南的战火。美帝国主义妄图把战争扩大到中国来，要发动对中国的武装侵略，要同中国较量一番，它的这个方针是早已定了的。约翰逊政府挂在嘴边的对中国的“和平”言词，完全是迷惑人的烟幕弹。
    中国是一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的社会主义国家。中国人民高举伟大的革命红旗，坚决反对帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界各国人民的革命斗争。因此，美帝国主义把社会主义的中国看成是实现它的侵略政策和战争政策的最大障碍，当作它的最大的敌人，要用包括战争在内的一切手段来扼杀中国。
    中国人民同美帝国主义是势不两立的。美帝国主义的战争挑衅，只能更加激励中国人民下定决心，誓同中国人民的死敌、全世界人民的头号敌人斗争到底。美帝国主义对中国人民欠下的累累血债，一定要彻底清算，全部讨还，绝对不能饶恕美帝国主义对中国人民犯下的血腥罪行！
    毛主席说：“我们的方针也是老早定了的，就是针锋相对”。中国人民对于美帝国主义是没有任何幻想的。中国人民早就作好了准备。我们正在严阵以待。目前在我国开展的规模空前的、声势浩大的、伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，也正是最大最好的战备。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的任何侵略行动，美帝国主义的一切战争计划必将被彻底粉碎。
