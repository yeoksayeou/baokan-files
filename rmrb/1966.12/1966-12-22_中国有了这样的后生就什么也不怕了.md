On the afternoon of November 22, around 3 PM, a fire broke out at the home of poor peasant community member Xie Qinghui in Yanjiagang Production Brigade, Zhizi Production Team, Jiangjiang People's Commune, Changsha County. In an instant, thick smoke filled the air and flames shot into the sky. Over a hundred Red Guards, who were on their way to Shaoshan, saw the scene and, driven by a strong sense of protecting the people's lives and property, forgot their fatigue from the long journey. They spontaneously rushed towards the fire.

The fire grew larger, engulfing the homes of five poor peasant households. The young revolutionaries, fearless in the face of danger, bravely fought against the raging flames. Some carried water, some climbed onto the roofs, and some rushed into the houses to save furniture. A Red Guard saw a pig weighing over forty pounds fall into a pit of human waste half a person deep. He immediately jumped into the pit, pulled the pig out, and was completely soaked in filth, but paid no mind. The young revolutionaries' hearts were redder than the fire, and their resolve to overcome difficulties was as strong as a mountain. They fought while shouting, "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory." Chairman Mao's teachings gave those around them fighting the fire boundless strength. After more than two hours of heroic rescue efforts by the Red Guards and local residents, the fire was finally extinguished.

To help the affected poor and lower-middle peasants quickly rebuild their homes, the young revolutionaries launched a support campaign. Some donated Chairman Mao's works, some donated money, and some donated goods. Before leaving, they also left nine classmates to help the affected poor and lower-middle peasants work for two days. They did so many good deeds, but when the community members asked for their names, they humbly replied, "We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards. This is what we should do." No matter how much the community members insisted, they refused to reveal their names. The poor and lower-middle peasants repeatedly said, "These items are your necessities. No matter how great the difficulty, we cannot accept your things." But these revolutionary youth left the items and walked away.

Later, the local poor and lower-middle peasants had no choice but to hand over the money, grain, and clothing they had donated to the local government, intending to send them to their respective units.

The high-minded actions of the Red Guards left a deep impression on the poor and lower-middle peasants. Old poor peasant Du Zichang said, "These are the fine young people raised by Chairman Mao! With such youth, China fears nothing."

    中国有了这样的后生就什么也不怕了
    十一月二十二日下午三时左右，长沙县九江公社芝子大队烟家河生产队贫农社员谢青辉家失了火。霎时浓烟弥漫，火光冲天。正在向韶山进发的一百多名红卫兵小将，经过这里，见此情景，一股保卫人民生命财产的强烈感情，使他们忘记了长途跋涉的疲劳，不约而同地向失火地点奔去。
    火越来越大，五户贫农的房子都被火光吞没了。革命小将们临危不惧，同熊熊的烈火展开了英勇斗争，有的提水，有的上屋，有的冲进房子里抢救家具。一个红卫兵看到一口四十多斤重的猪掉进半人深的粪池里，马上跳到池里把猪抱上来，满身被粪水浸透，也毫不在意。小将们忠于毛泽东思想的心比火还红，战胜困难的决心比山还大，他们一面战斗，一面振臂高呼：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的教导，给周围救火的人们增添了无穷无尽的力量。经过红卫兵和当地群众两个多小时的奋勇抢救，大火终于被扑灭了。
    为了使受灾的贫下中农迅速重建家园，小将们开展了一个支援救灾的活动，有的献毛主席著作，有的献钱，有的献物。临走时，他们还留下九位同学，帮助受灾的贫下中农劳动两天。他们做了这么多的好事，可是当社员问他们的姓名的时候，他们却谦虚地回答：“我们是毛主席的红卫兵。这是我们应该做的。”无论如何不肯说出自己的名字。贫下中农再三表示：“这些东西是你们的生活必需品，我们遇到再大的困难，也不能要你们的东西。”可是这些革命青少年把东西放下就走了。
    后来，当地贫下中农只好把他们捐出的钱、粮、衣物交给当地政府，准备寄到他们所在的单位去。
    红卫兵这一高尚行动，给贫下中农留下了极深刻的印象。老贫农杜子章说：“这是毛主席培养出来的好青年啊！中国有了这样的后生子，就什么也不怕了。”
