Letters from Abroad

Chairman Mao's Words Are Classics

Chairman Mao's words, every single word and sentence, are modern classics. Chairman Mao has surpassed all the sages of the past and present. Now, the Chinese people are further carrying out the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, which is indeed a very good thing. I deeply feel that China truly deserves to be a country with the most ancient culture in the East. Especially the large-scale promotion and use of young people, and the effort to cultivate successors, this also gives us great enlightenment.

Let us unite as one and strive for the construction of a new world.

Hungry for Chairman Mao's Books

With a joyful heart, I eagerly read the works of Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao. Because I firmly believe that with Mao Zedong Thought, I will definitely improve my political consciousness and devote myself to the revolutionary struggle every day.

I Respect Comrade Mao Zedong

I respect Comrade Mao Zedong. He is a great strategist and philosopher.

I will study Chairman Mao's books for life and devote myself to the revolution for life.

Carve Chairman Mao's Words in My Heart

I have carefully read some of Chairman Mao Zedong's works and have engraved the words of this great leader in my heart. Some of these words, I will use for the rest of my life. Chairman Mao Zedong is worthy of being called the Lenin of our time. He has liberated the Chinese people from bondage. His thoughts will liberate more people.

    让我们团结一致，为建设新世界而努力奋斗。
