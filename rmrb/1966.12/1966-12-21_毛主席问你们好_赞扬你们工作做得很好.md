Chairman Mao is in good health. Over ten million reception workers enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Xiao Hua, and Jiang Qing spoke, enthusiastically praising the PLA fighters as true soldiers of the great Chairman Mao, excellent propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, and true servants of the people, who have done a great job in safeguarding the Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: Central and other leaders held a reception on the afternoon of the 19th in the capital for more than ten million PLA fighters and party and government officials who had worked hard to receive revolutionary students and Red Guards.

At 2:40 PM, Zhang Chunqiao, deputy director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, announced the start of the reception. Central leaders braved the cold wind, riding in open-top cars, slowly circling the spacious Workers' Stadium to meet with the PLA fighters. The entire venue was in an uproar, with fighters waving the red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouting in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

Xiao Hua, director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, spoke first. He expressed greetings on behalf of Comrade Lin Biao, the Central Military Commission, and the PLA General Departments to everyone.

Comrade Xiao Hua said, the glorious task entrusted to you by our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao has been successfully completed. With selfless revolutionary spirit and boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, you have received the guests of Chairman Mao. Your work is excellent!

Comrade Jiang Qing, first deputy director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, spoke next. She enthusiastically said, "Comrades, revolutionary comrades, greetings!" I salute you with proletarian revolutionary greetings.

She said, Chairman Mao sends greetings to you! You must be very concerned about Chairman Mao, so let me tell you, he is very healthy. At this moment, the entire venue enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Comrade Jiang Qing said, in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you have done a lot of work, serving the Red Guard youngsters, allowing revolutionary students from all over the country to see Chairman Mao and his close comrades-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and other central leaders. Your work is very good! She said, you have become an invincible force because you are an army armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Chen Boda, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, spoke at the meeting. He said, over the past few months, more than ten million revolutionary students from across the country have come to Beijing to meet our great leader Chairman Mao. You have done an extremely good job of receiving them. You are truly the soldiers of the great Chairman Mao. You do not betray the glorious honor of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army. You truly embody the purpose of the people's army as indicated by Chairman Mao to serve the people. You are truly a proletarian people's army.

Comrade Chen Boda said, such an army as yours is unprecedented in world history. With such an army, with an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we can be invincible. No matter what enemy, whether it is imperialism, revisionism, or all kinds of ghosts and monsters, they will be smashed to pieces when they encounter you. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, you truly understand the meaning of serving the people. We should learn from you. We are your students. We hope to advance together with you, our many teachers. His speech was met with prolonged applause and cheers from the entire venue.

Comrade Zhou Enlai, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, spoke last amidst thunderous applause. He first, on behalf of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, and on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, extended cordial greetings to all participants in the reception work. He said:

"Chairman Mao said that you have done excellent work in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Comrade Zhou Enlai said, you have first done an excellent job of learning from the masses. You have successively received revolutionary students from all over the country who have been received by Chairman Mao. This Cultural Revolution, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, is unprecedented in history. He said, everyone should learn from the masses. You have personally come into contact with many revolutionary youngsters and learned their daring to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to make revolution, and dare to rebel revolutionary spirit.

He said, you are excellent propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. You have done an excellent job of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and propagating to the broad revolutionary students. You have helped train revolutionary youngsters, received and sent revolutionary youngsters, and this work has been very tense, busy, and meticulous. This is actually a large-scale exercise in serving the people. You have also done work to safeguard the Cultural Revolution. The Cultural Revolution has attracted many revolutionary students to Beijing. At its peak, there were more than three million revolutionary students in Beijing, but the order was very good, which left a deep impression on the people of our country and foreign friends, showing the immense power of the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said, the situation of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is very good. It is advancing steadily. But it is not smooth sailing without obstacles. In fact, a handful of capitalist roaders in power and all kinds of ghosts and monsters are unwilling to admit defeat and are struggling desperately. We must keep our eyes open and, while practicing great proletarian democracy, strengthen proletarian dictatorship. Relying on the broad masses of the people, we will root out and smash all counter-revolutionaries who dare to sabotage the Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has not only inspired the revolutionary people of China but also inspired the revolutionary people of the world, making the hidden counter-revolutionaries in China tremble with fear and making the imperialists, modern revisionists, and all reactionaries in the world tremble with fear!

After the speech, the central leaders went to the Workers' Gymnasium to extend cordial greetings to more than ten thousand central and Beijing municipal party and government officials who had gathered there.

The meeting concluded with all attendees, under the direction of Comrade Zhou Enlai, singing, "The vast ocean relies on the helmsman, all things grow under the sun, dew and rain nourish the seedlings, and revolutionary work relies on Mao Zedong Thought..." The revolutionary spirit-filled song echoed throughout the venue.

The central and other leaders who participated in the reception included Tao Zhu, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Yang Chengwu, Wu De, Liao Chengzhi, Xiao Jinguang, Su Yu, Yang Yong, Li Zhimin, Liao Hansheng, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Peng Shaohui, Liu Zhijian, Xu Licheng, Yuan Ziqing, Zhang Chuming, Wu Faxian, Yu Lijin, Wu Kehua, Chen Renmi, Cui Tianmin, Tan Furen, Jiang Wen, Huang Wenming, Li Zhen, Zheng Weishan, Fu Chongbi, Huang Zuozhen, Cai Shunli, Hu Chi, Peng Fujiu, Li Xin, Ye Yungao, Xie Pingzhong, Wang Li, Guan Feng, Chen Boda, Mu Xin, Yao Wenyuan, Wang Dongxing, Xiong Fu, Tang Pingzhu, Cao Yiyou, Yu Sang, Song Qiong, etc.

    周恩来、陈伯达、萧华、江青同志讲话，热烈称赞解放军指战员不愧是伟大的毛主席的战士，是很好的毛泽东思想宣传员，真正懂得为人民服务，作了保卫文化大革命的工作。
    新华社二十日讯　中央和其他各方面负责同志，十九日下午在首都接见了辛勤接待革命师生和红卫兵的十多万中国人民解放军指战员和党政机关工作人员。
    下午二时四十分，中共中央文化革命小组副组长张春桥同志宣布接见大会开始。中央负责同志们冒着寒风，分乘敞篷汽车，在宽广的工人体育场上缓缓绕行，同参加大会的人民解放军指战员亲切会见。这时，全场沸腾，指战员们挥舞着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，齐声欢呼“毛主席万岁！”“伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    中国人民解放军总政治部主任萧华同志首先在会上讲话。他代表林彪同志和中共中央军委以及人民解放军各总部，向大家表示慰问。
    萧华同志说，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，交给你们的光荣任务，已经胜利地完成了。你们以忘我的革命精神，以满腔的革命热情，接待了毛主席的客人。你们的工作做得好！
    中共中央文化革命小组第一副组长江青同志接着讲话。她热情地说，同志们，革命的战友们，你们好！我向你们致无产阶级革命的敬礼。
    她说，毛主席问你们好！你们一定很关心毛主席，告诉你们，他很健康。这时，全场热烈高呼：毛主席万岁，万万岁！
    江青同志说，在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，你们做了许多工作，为红卫兵小将服务，使全国的革命师生见到毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志、周恩来同志以及中央其他负责同志，你们工作做得好得很啊！她说，你们所以成为一支战无不胜的力量，就是因为你们是一支用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的人民的军队。
    中共中央政治局常委、中共中央文化革命小组组长陈伯达同志在会上讲话。他说，几个月来，全国一千多万革命师生到北京来，会见了我们的伟大领袖毛主席，你们作了非常好非常好的接待工作。你们不愧是伟大的毛主席的战士。你们不辜负伟大的中国人民解放军的崇高荣誉。你们真正地实现了毛主席所指示的为人民服务的军队的宗旨，你们不愧是无产阶级的人民军队。
    陈伯达同志说，像你们这样的军队，是世界历史上从来没有过的。有了你们这样的军队，有你们这样的用毛泽东思想武装起来的军队，我们就可以无敌于天下。不管什么敌人，不管是帝国主义也好，修正主义也好，一切牛鬼蛇神也好，碰到了你们，就会碰得粉碎。你们在毛主席和林彪同志的领导下，真正懂得为人民服务。这一点，我们要向你们学习。我们是你们的学生。我们这些学生，希望同你们这许多先生一块前进。他的讲话，博得全场经久不息的掌声和欢呼声。
    中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理周恩来同志最后在全场暴风雨般的掌声中讲话。他首先代表伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表党中央和国务院，向参加接待工作的全体人员表示亲切慰问。他说：
    “毛主席说，你们这次在无产阶级文化大革命中，工作做得很好。”周恩来同志说，你们首先做了很好的向群众学习的工作。你们先后接待了受到毛主席接见的来自全国各地的革命师生。这次文化大革命在毛主席的亲自领导下，轰轰烈烈地开展，这是史无前例的。他说，我们每个人都要向群众学习。你们亲身接触了许多革命小将，学到了他们敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢革命、敢造反的革命精神。
    他说，你们是很好的毛泽东思想的宣传员。你们很好地活学活用毛主席著作，向广大革命师生作了很好的宣传。你们帮助训练革命小将，接送革命小将，这项工作做得非常紧张、繁忙，又非常细致。这事实上是一次为人民服务的大演习。你们还作了保卫文化大革命的工作。文化革命把很多革命师生吸引到北京来了。最多的时候有三百多万革命师生在北京，而秩序却很好，这给了我国人民和外国朋友们很深刻的印象，显示了中国人民在毛泽东思想指引下强大无比的威力。
    周恩来同志最后说，我们无产阶级文化大革命的形势是很好的。它正在浩浩荡荡地向前迈进。但不是一帆风顺没有阻力的。事实上，一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神，不甘心失败，总是拚命挣扎。我们要擦亮眼睛，在实行无产阶级大民主的同时，加强无产阶级专政。依靠广大人民群众，把胆敢破坏文化革命的反革命分子揪出来，把他们打倒。我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这次无产阶级文化大革命，不仅鼓舞了中国的革命人民，也鼓舞了全世界革命人民，使中国暗藏的反革命分子吓破了胆，也使世界上帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派吓破了胆！
    讲话结束后，中央负责同志又来到了工人体育馆，向汇集在这里的一万多中央和北京市党政机关接待工作人员致亲切的问候。
    大会最后，在周恩来同志指挥下，全体到会同志高唱：“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，雨露滋润禾苗壮，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。……”充满革命豪情的歌声，激荡着整个会场。
    参加接见的中央和各方面的负责同志有：陶铸、康生、李富春、陈毅、李先念、谭震林、谢富治、刘宁一、杨成武、吴德、廖承志、萧劲光、粟裕、杨勇、李志民、廖汉生、李天佑、王新亭、彭绍辉、刘志坚、徐立清、袁子钦、张池明、吴法宪、余立金、吴克华、陈仁麒、崔田民、谭辅仁、江文、黄文明、李真、郑维山、傅崇碧、黄作珍、蔡顺礼、胡痴、彭富九、李信、叶运高、谢镗忠、王力、关锋、戚本禹、穆欣、姚文元、汪东兴、熊复、唐平铸、曹轶欧、于桑、宋琼等。
