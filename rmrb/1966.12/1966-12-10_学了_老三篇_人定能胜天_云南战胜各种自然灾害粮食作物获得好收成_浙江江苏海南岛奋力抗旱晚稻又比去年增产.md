Yunnan Province's various ethnic communities have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, relying on Mao Zedong Thought to overcome various natural disasters, achieving a good harvest for grain crops. According to statistics from relevant departments, the province's total grain output has increased by one and a half times compared to last year.

This spring and summer, most of Yunnan experienced prolonged drought with little rain for over a hundred days. At this critical moment, the various ethnic communities actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using the "Three Articles" as their battle weapon, and with unwavering confidence, they fought against the drought, ensuring timely planting and irrigation for the autumn crops.

After autumn, continuous rain lasted for over a month in various places, and some areas were also hit by diseases, pests, wind, and hail. The communities continued to fight against these natural disasters and finally achieved a good harvest.

According to a report from Hangzhou on the 9th, the harvest of late-season rice in Zhejiang Province, covering over 1,800 million mu, has ended, with most areas seeing an increase in production of over 10% compared to last year. In the southern and western mountainous areas of Zhejiang and the Zhoushan Archipelago, many communes that previously had lower yields saw a significant increase in late-season rice production, setting a new historical record.

Zhejiang's increase in late-season rice production this year is a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought. During the rice transplanting period, many areas experienced continuous drought, but the masses studied the "Three Articles," established the idea that people can conquer nature, actively sought water sources, and irrigated the rice fields, ensuring that over 1,000 million mu of double-cropping late-season rice seedlings were transplanted on time. During the rice growth period, various measures were taken to strengthen the cultivation and management of the seedlings.

According to a report from Nanjing on the 9th, following the bumper harvests of early and mid-season rice, Jiangsu Province's 140 million mu of late-season rice also saw an increase in production. The Taihu Lake region, where late-season rice accounts for more than two-thirds of the province's total area, saw an increase in production of about 10% based on last year's high yield.

Late-season rice is Jiangsu Province's highest-yielding grain crop. This year's drought is one of the most severe in decades. The local officials and masses followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "discard illusions and prepare for struggle," persevering in drought resistance during late-season rice production and striving to improve cultivation levels. The masses in the Taihu Lake region learned from Comrade White's spirit of being extremely responsible in his work, universally following Chen Yongkang's full set of experiences, formulating agricultural work standards, and cultivating with meticulous care. Many places saw communes and fields with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu and 1,300-1,400 jin per field.

According to a report from Guangzhou, Hainan Island achieved a good harvest of late-season rice in a year of severe drought. Preliminary statistics show that the island's late-season rice production increased by about 20% compared to last year.

This year, Hainan's late-season rice experienced severe autumn drought during its growth period. However, the various ethnic peoples studied the "Three Articles," resolved to be like the legendary Yu Gong, and fought against the drought with all their might, finally achieving a bumper harvest.

For more than half a month, from the Wuzhishan area to the coastal plains, the scene was one of abundance. The Li, Miao, and Han peoples joyfully said: This year's late-season rice harvest was not due to the weather or the land, but entirely due to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

In the past half month, from the Wuzhishan area to the coastal plains, everywhere was a scene of abundance. The Li, Miao, and Han peoples joyfully said: This year's late-season rice harvest was not due to the weather or the land, but entirely due to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

In Zhouning County, Fujian, the masses, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, overcame a severe typhoon and achieved a bumper grain harvest. This is a scene from Duanxuan Brigade, Duyuan Commune, Zhouning County, where community members are bringing in new grain from the fields.

    学了“老三篇”  人定能胜天
    云南战胜各种自然灾害粮食作物获得好收成
    浙江江苏海南岛奋力抗旱晚稻又比去年增产
    据新华社昆明电　云南省各族社员活学活用毛主席著作，依靠毛泽东思想战胜了各种自然灾害，全省粮食作物获得了好收成。据有关部门统计，全省粮食总产量比去年增加一成半。
    今年春夏之交，云南大部地区久晴少雨，干旱持续一百多天。在这紧要关头，各族社员活学活用毛主席著作，以“老三篇”作为战斗武器，信心百倍地同干旱展开斗争，保证了秋收作物的适时栽种和作物生长期的灌溉用水。
    入秋以后，各地阴雨连绵达一个多月，部分地区还遭到病、虫、风、雹等自然灾害的侵袭。各地社员继续同各种自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，终于夺得好收成。
    据新华社杭州九日电浙江省一千八百多万亩晚稻收割结束，大部分地区比去年增产一成以上；浙南、浙西山区和舟山群岛许多过去产量较低的公社，今年晚稻大幅度增产，创造了历史上最高纪录。
    浙江今年晚稻增产是毛泽东思想的新胜利。在晚稻插秧期间，许多地区连续干旱，但是广大社员学习“老三篇”，树立了人定胜天的思想，积极寻找水源，灌溉稻田，终于使一千多万亩双季连作晚稻秧苗适时栽插下去。在晚稻生长期间，各地又采取各种办法，加强了禾苗的培育管理。
    据新华社南京九日电江苏省继早、中稻丰收之后，一千四百万亩晚稻又获增产。晚稻面积占全省三分之二以上的太湖地区，晚稻在去年高产的基础上又增产一成左右。
    晚稻是江苏省一季产量最高的粮食作物。今年的干旱是江苏省几十年来少见的。各地干部群众遵照毛主席“丢掉幻想，准备斗争”的教导，在晚稻生产中坚持抗旱，并努力提高耕作水平。太湖地区广大社员，学习白求恩同志对工作极端负责任的精神，普遍按照陈永康的全套经验，制定农活规格，栽培管理精益求精，很多地方出现亩产千斤的社队和一千三四百斤的田块。
    据新华社广州电　海南岛在大旱之年晚稻获得好收成。据初步统计，整个海南岛的晚稻产量比去年增加两成左右。
    今年海南区的晚稻在生长期间，遇上了严重秋旱。但是，各族人民大学“老三篇”，立下愚公志，奋力抗旱，终于夺得丰收。
    半个多月来，从五指山区到沿海平原，到处是丰收的景象。黎、苗、汉各族人民欣喜地说：今年晚稻获得丰收，不靠天，不靠地，全靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。（附图片）
    福建周宁县广大干部社员以毛泽东思想为武器，战胜特大台风，夺得粮食丰收。这是周宁县峬源公社端源大队的社员从田间运回新粮。
