Cadres and members in Sichuan are actively learning and applying the "Old Three Articles," and their revolutionary enthusiasm is soaring high. The basic construction of farmland in Sichuan is progressing at a large scale and fast pace.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Chengdu, the basic construction of farmland in Sichuan Province has reached a new high. Currently, more than 4.8 million rural cadres and members are participating in the farmland basic construction movement. The scale, progress, and quality of the construction have far exceeded previous years.

This year, the farmland basic construction projects in various places in Sichuan are generally organized by communes and production brigades, relying on the masses to self-reliantly carry them out. Therefore, they have achieved quick, efficient, and cost-effective results. Statistics show that the province has already transformed over 1 million mu of low-yield fields (including paddy fields and dry land). There are more than 75,000 water conservancy projects under construction. In conjunction with the transformation of low-yield fields and water conservancy construction, various places have planted a large number of trees.

The vast number of rural cadres and members have enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. They are studying Chairman Mao's works extensively and applying them extensively. They take the "Old Three Articles" as their motto, thoroughly criticize and repudiate selfishness, and establish public spirit, promoting the revolutionization of thought and driving the basic construction of farmland. In most counties, districts, and communes in Leshan Prefecture, meetings to study and apply Chairman Mao's works or conferences of active members in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works have been held at all levels. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the members has been greatly aroused. In just over half a month, the entire prefecture has transformed more than 270,000 mu of low-yield fields, built more than 400 new ponds and stone embankments, and planted tens of thousands of trees.

    干部社员活学活用“老三篇”革命热情高涨
    四川农田基本建设规模大进度快
    据新华社成都电　四川省的农田基本建设出现了新的高潮。目前，全省投入农田基本建设运动的农村干部和社员达四百八十多万人，建设的规模、进度和质量都大大超过往年。
    今年四川各地的农田基本建设工程，一般都是由社队依靠群众自力更生地举办的。因此，收到了多快好省的效果。据统计，全省已经改造低产田土（即水田和旱地）一百多万亩，正在动工的各种水利工程共有七万五千多处。结合改造低产田土和兴修水利，各地还栽植了一大批树木。
    广大农村干部和社员热烈响应林彪同志把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动提高到一个新阶段的伟大号召，大学大用毛主席著作。他们以“老三篇”为座右铭，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，促进了思想革命化，推动了农田基本建设。乐山专区的大部分县区和公社，层层召开了毛主席著作讲用会或活学活用毛主席著作积极分子大会，社员们的革命热情大为高涨，只用了半个多月的时间，全区就改造低产田土二万七千多亩，新修平塘和石河堰四百多处，还栽了数以万计的树木。
