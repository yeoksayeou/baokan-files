Forty years ago, Chairman Mao, in his famous work "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," meaningfully cited the story of "Yepu Loves Dragons." Forty years later, today, as we face the magnificent spectacle of the broad masses rising up to criticize the capitalist reactionary line, revisiting this story is very meaningful.

Yepu was very fond of dragons. He would "carve dragons on hooks and chisel dragons on walls," and everywhere in his house were pictures of dragons. One day, a real dragon appeared, "peering its head through the window and stretching its tail in the hall," but Yepu was so frightened that he "lost his soul and was at a loss for words." It turned out that Yepu's affection was not for real dragons but for something that was dragon-like but not a real dragon.

Under the guidance of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing with the momentum of a thunderous storm, breaking through the numerous obstacles of the capitalist reactionary line and developing in a deeper and broader direction.

The masses have truly been mobilized!

Facing such a magnificent mass movement, true revolutionaries feel an unprecedented exhilaration in the new situation. They immerse themselves in the movement, enthusiastically praising the revolutionary mass movement as excellent!

There are also some people who, in normal times, talk about believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses. They also shout, "Mobilize the broad masses! Criticize the capitalist reactionary line!" But when the masses are truly mobilized and the revolutionary torrent surges like the Yangtze River, they cry out, "You are overdoing it by criticizing the capitalist reactionary line!" "You are inciting the masses to fight the masses, which is a new form of the capitalist reactionary line"...

The characters like Yepu have reappeared in the new mass movement!

This cannot but make people ponder: Why is there a discrepancy between words and actions? Ultimately, this involves the attitude in one's soul towards the masses and the mass movement.

The struggle to criticize the capitalist reactionary line is to fully mobilize the masses and remove all obstacles to the mass movement. If you are a true proletarian revolutionary, not just a revolutionary in words, you will certainly rejoice and be inspired by the rise of hundreds of millions of people, stand with the masses to make revolution, and together join the torrent of criticizing the capitalist reactionary line. If you still harbor bourgeois or petty-bourgeois impurities or other selfish motives deep in your soul, especially when the revolution reaches your own head, you will inevitably feel panic-stricken, even develop a hostile attitude, continue to adhere to the wrong line, oppose the mass movement, and thus slide into the position of opposing the Party and the masses. The reason Yepu was afraid of the real dragon is that deep in his soul, he had something that feared the impact of the dragon. Yepu was just a character in a story, but the Yepus in real life are products of a certain class ideology.

The mass "giant dragon" criticizing the capitalist reactionary line is soaring into the sky, its form is majestic and powerful, and its momentum is irresistible. In the face of this "giant dragon," are you joyful and inspired, or are you worried and anxious? Do you fight together with the masses, or do you stand apart?

Every revolutionary comrade must examine his soul on this issue.

    重温“叶公好龙”
    四十年前，毛主席在他著名的《湖南农民运动考察报告》一文中，意味深长地引用了一个“叶公好龙”的故事。四十年后的今天，面对着广大群众起来批判资产阶级反动路线的壮丽图景，重新回味这个故事，是很有意义的。
    叶公是很“爱”龙的。“钩以写龙，凿以写龙”，屋里到处画的都是龙。一天，真龙出现了，“窥头于牖，施尾于堂”，叶公却吓得
  “失其魂魄，五色无主”了！原来叶公爱好的并非真龙，而是一种似龙非龙的什么东西。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命在以毛主席为代表的革命路线指引下，正以雷霆万钧之势，冲破资产阶级反动路线的重重阻碍，向着更深入、更广阔的方面发展。
    群众真正发动起来了！
    面临着这样轰轰烈烈的群众运动，在新形势面前，真正的革命者都感到一种前所未有的痛快，他们置身于运动之中，热烈赞扬革命的群众运动好得很！
    也有些人，他们在平时也讲相信群众，依靠群众，发动群众。他们也高喊：“发动广大群众！批判资产阶级反动路线！”而在群众真正发动起来了，革命的洪流有如长江大河浩浩荡荡奔腾而至的时候，他们却又大叫：“你们批判资产阶级反动路线过火了！”“你们挑动群众斗群众，是资产阶级反动路线的新形式”……他们就活像叶公见了“真龙”，心惊胆战，失了魂魄。
    叶公式的人物，在新的群众运动中再现了！
    这不能不又引起人们思索：为什么口头上和行动上不是一回事呢？归根结底，这里有一个灵魂深处如何对待群众，对待群众运动的态度问题。
    批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争，就是为了放手发动群众，踢开一切阻碍群众运动的绊脚石。你如果是一个真正的无产阶级革命家，而不是一个口头上的革命派，你必定会为亿万人民的兴起而欢呼，而鼓舞，同群众站在一起闹革命，一起投入批判资产阶级反动路线的洪流。如果你灵魂深处还保留着资产阶级的或小资产阶级的杂质或是其他的私心杂念，在革命的群众面前，特别是当革命革到自己头上的时候，你就必然会感到惊慌失措，甚至产生对抗情绪，继续坚持错误路线，对抗群众运动，那就会滑到同党和群众对抗的地步。叶公之所以害怕真龙，就是因为他的灵魂深处有着怕龙冲击的东西。叶公只不过是故事中的人物，而现实生活中的叶公，却是一定的阶级意识形态的产物。
    批判资产阶级反动路线的群众“巨龙”正在腾空而起，其形威武雄壮，其势锐不可当。在这个“巨龙”面前，自己是欢欣鼓舞，还是忧心忡忡？是和群众共同战斗，还是格格不入？
    每一个革命同志，必须在这个问题上检验自己的灵魂。
