Students from the Hainan Island Automobile School were deeply moved by the actions of the PLA comrades on their first night in Beijing. Comrade Tan Jufu, who served as the Red Guards' instructor, repeatedly helped the Red Guards cover themselves with blankets and added coal to the stove throughout the night. Seeing that some students had thin blankets, he gave them his own blanket and overcoat, and sat up all night himself. The next day, the PLA comrades led everyone to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and together they recited: "Our cadres must care for every soldier, and all revolutionaries must care for, love, and help each other." The students from the Automobile School thought to themselves: The PLA comrades do it this way, we should learn from them.

On the second night, the students from the Automobile School discussed among themselves and decided that since they had more blankets, they should care for students from other places. They took out two blankets and three quilts and sent them to Room 7, for the students from Inner Mongolia and Jiangsu. The students from Jiangsu and Inner Mongolia were very touched by these "gifts" and felt that they should also prioritize caring for others over themselves. They then sent the blankets and quilts to Room 9 for the students from Hunan. The Hunan students, upon seeing this, decided to learn from this selfless spirit and sent the blankets and quilts to Room 6 for the female students.

In this way, several blankets and quilts were passed through many rooms. Everyone said: "Although we didn't use them to cover ourselves, our hearts felt warm, and the deep class friendship warmed our entire bodies." Some students happily said: "This is the result of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and it is the result of learning from the PLA."

    毛主席的红小兵
    照解放军的样子去做
    海南岛汽车学校的同学，到北京的第一天晚上，深深被解放军同志的行动感动了。担任红卫兵指导员的谭菊甫同志，夜里一次又一次地帮助红卫兵盖被子，一次又一次地往煤炉子添煤，看到有的同学被子单薄，便把自己的被子和大衣给他们盖上，自己却坐了一夜。第二天，解放军同志领着大家学习《为人民服务》，和大家一起念：“我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”汽车学校的同学们心里想：解放军同志就是这样做的，我们要好好学习。
    第二天晚上，汽车学校的同学在一起讨论，认为自己的被子多，应该关心由别的地方来的同学，便拿出两床被子、三床毯子送到七号房间，给来自内蒙古、江苏的同学。江苏、内蒙古的同学接到这些“礼物”很感动，觉得自己也应该关心他人比关心自己为重，便把被子、毯子送到九号房间，交给湖南同学。湖南同学一看，决心学习这种专门利人的高贵品质，又把被子、毯子送到六号房间给女同学用。
    就这样，几条被子和毯子传了很多房间。大家说：“虽然没有盖在身上，心里却热呼呼的，深厚的阶级友爱的感情暖透了全身。”有的同学高兴地说：“这是活学活用毛主席著作的结果，是向解放军学习的结果。”
