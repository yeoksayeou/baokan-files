The "Sea Tiger Boat," which earned distinction in the naval battle east of Chongwu, has a quote board made by the sailors at every station and a quote banner painted by the sailors in every cabin. They say: A sentence from Chairman Mao is an unshakable truth; a quote from Chairman Mao is an order to mobilize. In the midst of raging winds and waves, learning it means overcoming difficulties; in the face of gunfire and bullets, learning it means defeating any enemy.

	In the Rescue Operation

One noon, the sea was windy and the waves were high, with rolling tides. In the anchorage of the Chongwu fishing ground on the front line in Fujian, many fishing boats were moored to avoid the wind. The "Sea Tiger Boat" was also on standby. Suddenly, the lookout spotted that a large fishing boat had broken its anchor and was being blown out to sea. This area has high waves and many hidden reefs, and the fishing boat was in imminent danger of being wrecked and its crew drowned.

The "Sea Tiger Boat" immediately set sail and chased after the fishing boat. As they approached, due to the high winds and waves, the boat could not get close. What to do? Could they just watch as the people's lives and property were endangered?

At this moment, a gunner climbed onto the turret and loudly recited Chairman Mao's quote: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. This army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly for the interests of the people."

A sharp question was posed to every sailor: Could the harsh environment shake our resolve to completely and thoroughly serve the people's interests? No! The soldiers unanimously demanded: "Swim over and bring the rope to the fishing boat!"

In such a stormy sea, to chase a distance of several dozen meters and catch up with the drifting fishing boat, what a great risk it was! The platoon leader hesitated. But the soldiers repeatedly requested, and finally, the platoon leader agreed to let the two best swimmers, Tan Dacheng and Guo Peiai, jump into the sea.

They saw the two dive into the sea, bravely swimming against the waves towards the fishing boat. After several dozen minutes of struggle, they finally boarded the fishing boat and brought back the rope. They searched the entire boat but found no one, as the fishermen had anchored the boat and gone ashore.

Late at night, the "Sea Tiger Boat" towed the fishing boat back to shore, successfully completing the mission. After a day of intense battle, the sailors were very tired, but they remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on completely and thoroughly serving the people. No one went to rest; they automatically picked up buckets and cleaning tools, wiping down the fishing boat and tidying up the cabin, which had been scattered by the waves, making it clean and orderly.

	After the Return

On another day, the gunboat successfully completed its patrol mission and returned to shore, cutting through the waves. At this time, a new soldier on the boat saw the political commissar standing alertly at the cannon position, vigilantly watching for the enemy. He was concerned that the old soldier might be standing too long and wanted to bring him a stool to sit on. The commissar declined and kindly told him: "Our battle has not ended, we cannot sit down, otherwise if the enemy plane suddenly appears, we will lose the opportunity, and even suffer losses." Then, the most experienced old soldier on the boat, combined with his own battle experience, told everyone about Chairman Mao's teachings: "Create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until annihilation—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." Chairman Mao's words, like an order, immediately spread throughout the boat, and the sailors were all highly vigilant, firmly guarding their positions.

The gunboat docked at the pier, and the patrol mission was lifted. Despite being extremely tired, the gunners Wu Jiayi and Cai Shangru did not leave their positions. Chairman Mao's words were deeply engraved in their minds. They said: "Although the patrol mission has been lifted, the enemy has not been completely eliminated! If there is a situation, we must seize every second!" Not long after, an enemy plane indeed tried to sneak in from the sea. These two soldiers, upon hearing the enemy plane's noise, quickly climbed onto the cannon seat and fired a volley of shells at the enemy plane, causing it to turn around and flee in panic. This interception battle against the enemy plane lasted only seven seconds.

    一条语录一道“动员令”
    ——“海上猛虎艇”活学活用毛主席语录的故事
    在崇武以东的海战中荣立战功的“海上猛虎艇”，每个战位都有水兵们精心制作的毛主席语录板，每个机舱都有水兵们亲手绘制的语录标语。他们说：毛主席的一句话，就是一条颠扑不破的真理；毛主席的一条语录，就是一道“动员令”，狂风恶浪中学了它，艰苦困难踩脚下；枪林弹雨中学了它，任何敌人都不经打。
        在抢险时
    一天中午，海上风大浪涌，波涛滚滚，福建前线崇武渔场的锚地里，停泊着许多避风的渔船。“海上猛虎艇”也在锚地待命。突然，了望的战士发现，一艘大型渔船脱了锚，正在被大风刮向外海。这一带浪大暗礁多，这只渔船随时都有船碎人亡的危险。
      “海上猛虎艇”立即起航，向外海追去。接近渔船了，因为风大浪高，战艇靠不上去。怎么办？难道眼看着人民的生命财产受损失？
    这时候，一个枪炮兵跨上炮塔，向大家高声朗读毛主席的语录：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
    一个尖锐的问题摆在每个水兵面前：环境的险恶，能动摇我们完全、彻底为人民利益而工作的决心吗？不能！战士们一致要求：“泅水过去替渔船带缆！”
    在这样的惊涛骇浪中，要追几十米的距离，赶上飘行的渔船，那要冒多大的危险啊！中队长踌躇了。但战士们再三请求，中队长终于同意让两个水性最好的水兵谭大成、郭培爱下海去了。
    只见他两人翻身下海，迎着恶浪奋力向渔船游去。经过几十分钟的搏斗，他俩终于登上了渔船，带起了缆绳。他俩找遍了全船，没有发现一个人，原来船上的渔民抛好了锚，都到岸上去了。
    深夜，“海上猛虎艇”拖着渔船迎着风浪，胜利返航。经过一天激战，水兵们虽然十分劳累，但是他们牢记毛主席关于完全、彻底为人民服务的教导，谁也没去休息，自动拿起水桶和清洗工具，拭洗渔船，把被风浪打得七零八落的船舱收拾得干干净净，整整齐齐。
        在返航后
    在另一天，炮艇胜利完成巡逻任务，劈开浪涛，胜利返航。这时，一个初上艇的新战士，看见中队政委挺立在炮位前，机警地监视着敌人。他担心这位老水兵站得太久了，受不住，想给他搬条凳子坐坐。政委谢绝了，亲切地告诉他：“我们的战斗没有结束，不能坐下，否则敌机突然窜来，就会失去战机，甚至要吃亏的。”接着，这位全艇最有经验的老战士，结合自己的战斗经历，给大家讲了毛主席的教导：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”毛主席的话，像一道命令，立即传遍全艇，水兵们个个百倍警惕地坚守在自己的战位上。
    炮艇靠了码头，巡逻任务解除。枪炮兵吴加溪、蔡尚如虽然极度的疲劳，却不肯远离炮位。毛主席的话深深地刻在他们的脑子里，他们说：“巡逻任务虽然解除了，但是敌人并没有全部消灭！万一有了情况，就得争分夺秒啊！”没过多久，一架敌人的飞机果然企图从海面上偷偷地窜进大陆。这两个水兵一听到敌机的骚音，飞速地跨上炮座，对着敌机就是一排炮弹，飞贼掉转机头惊慌地向外海逃去。这次拦击飞贼的战斗，总共只用了七秒钟。　新华社通讯员
