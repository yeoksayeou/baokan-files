The cultural troupe of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party visited China for a performance tour. Upon arriving in China, they eagerly requested a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." When the Lao friends received "Quotations from Chairman Mao," many were moved to tears. Everyone spontaneously sang "The East is Red," and some jumped up shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

The Lao friends received the Chinese version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." However, this did not deter those who deeply loved Chairman Mao. They asked Chinese interpreters to translate "Quotations from Chairman Mao" into Lao, and then wrote it on big-character posters to be copied and read by everyone. They worked from dawn to dusk, day and night, and some even forgot to eat. One person, despite being ill, still insisted on copying. A twelve-year-old young actor named Mai Xin meticulously copied an entire book.

The Lao friends often read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together. Sometimes, they even took the time to write study notes and put up wall newspapers. Actor Vong said, "Chairman Mao's works are revolutionary treasures. We must study them well and be good students of Chairman Mao." Deputy Director Chan said, "Chairman Mao's words are all truths. We love to read them more and more."

    我们越读越爱读
    老挝爱国战线党中央文工团到中国访问演出时，一来中国就热切要求得到一本《毛主席语录》。当老挝朋友得到《毛主席语录》时，许多人激动得热泪盈眶。大家情不自禁地歌唱起《东方红》，有的人跳了起来高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    老挝朋友们拿到的是中文版《毛主席语录》。但是，这并难不倒对毛主席无比热爱的老挝朋友，他们请中国译员把《毛主席语录》翻译成老挝文，写成大字报贴在墙上让大家抄写阅读。他们起早贪黑，夜以继日，有的人常常连饭也顾不上吃，有的人病了也还坚持抄写。有一位十二岁的小演员名叫麦信，他却工工整整地抄了一厚本。
    老挝朋友们经常集体朗读《毛主席语录》，有时还抽空写学习心得和出墙报。演员汶翁说：“毛主席著作是革命的宝书，我们一定要好好学习，做毛主席的好学生。”副团长占农说：“毛主席的话，句句是真理，我们越读越爱读。”
