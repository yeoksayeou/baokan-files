	In the year 1966, China successfully conducted three nuclear tests. This is a heavy blow to the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists who collude with each other to attempt nuclear monopoly and sabotage the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations. It is a great encouragement to the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting against U.S. aggression for national salvation and to all revolutionary peoples around the world who are bravely fighting. It is a significant contribution to the defense of world peace.

    中国在今年一年内，成功地进行了三次核试验，这对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义相互勾结，妄图实行核垄断，破坏一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族革命斗争的阴谋是一个沉重的打击，对正在进行抗美救国斗争的英雄的越南人民和全世界正在进行英勇斗争的革命人民是一个巨大鼓舞，对保卫世界和平是一个重大贡献。
