Dear Red Guards and young revolutionaries!

Today, we will discuss the propaganda and mobilization work during marching. Propaganda and mobilization work is a powerful form of political and ideological work. The People's Liberation Army has always attached great importance to propaganda and mobilization work. It is highly combative and inspiring. In the past, whether during marching, combat, or executing other missions, the propaganda and mobilization work in the units were always very active. During combat, there was battlefield mobilization or frontline mobilization. During marching, there was mobilization along the way. This propaganda and mobilization work greatly boosted the fighting spirit of the troops, ensuring that the officers and soldiers remained spirited, enthusiastic, and full of revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism in any difficult and challenging situations. It played a significant role in ensuring the successful completion of marching and combat missions.

The propaganda and mobilization work during marching can be generally divided into two types: combat marching and general marching. During combat marching, the mission is urgent, and secrecy and silence are required. At this time, short and powerful mobilization work is particularly needed, with strong mobilization slogans to fill the officers and soldiers with a fearless revolutionary spirit and intense hatred towards the enemy, overcoming all difficulties and advancing bravely. Let's take an example from the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War. Once, a certain regiment's third battalion was assigned the honorable task of penetrating deep into the enemy's rear and attacking Daofeng Mountain. After the battalion and company leaders received the mission, they had only about ten minutes before departure. They mobilized the troops while marching, clearly explaining the upper-level's combat intentions and the significance of completing this infiltration mission to every soldier. At the same time, they also put forward powerful mobilization slogans, encouraging the soldiers to "Fight well! March well!" "Fight while marching, penetrate into the enemy's heart!" "Good Party members, good League members, and good soldiers go to Daofeng Mountain to achieve glory!" The entire battalion was united with a single resolve, a single idea, and a single goal: "Go to Daofeng Mountain to achieve glory!" Along the infiltration route, many soldiers, under such clear mobilization slogans, expressed their determination: "Even if we have to crawl, we will get to Daofeng Mountain!" Some soldiers said: "As long as we have a breath, we will fight to Daofeng Mountain!" This high fighting spirit ensured that the entire battalion, in a short period, broke through the enemy's seven barriers, advanced 120 miles, and successfully occupied Daofeng Mountain. During the self-defense counterattack on the China-India border, a certain regiment's second company of the border defense troops was tasked with a long-distance flanking maneuver to encircle the enemy. The troops marched day and night on rugged mountain roads, maintaining silence. In such circumstances, their propaganda and mobilization work was still very active. During the march, they used short breaks to conduct brief evaluations by the squad leaders, and during night marches, they softly spread good deeds. Sometimes they used the method of passing orders to encourage soldiers to overcome difficulties and persevere. For example: "Pass it on, hardship is glory, perseverance is victory!" "Think of your determination!" "Don't forget to avenge the martyrs!" "Keep up, maintain the honor of the company!" and so on. When the road was difficult and the soldiers were very tired, the company and platoon leaders also told stories like "Desert Pursuit" to the troops. The soldiers said: "In times of difficulty, thinking of revolutionary predecessors gives us strength!" The entire company climbed mountains, waded through rivers, drank cold water, and ate dry rations, marching continuously for four days and nights, with morale always high and no one falling behind.

In general marching, propaganda and mobilization work can be more active. Various forms can be adopted to carry out cultural and entertainment activities and propaganda and mobilization work, such as broadcasting good deeds, telling battle stories, telling glorious traditions, performing short skits, singing local operas, singing songs, shouting slogans, writing slogans, and setting up mobilization tents in key areas. For example, during a certain regiment's foot march, due to the long distance and hot weather, each company organized singing, song competitions, storytelling, and joke-telling activities. From the starting point to the campsite, songs and slogan shouts echoed, creating a lively atmosphere. This greatly boosted the morale of the officers and soldiers, reduced the fatigue of the troops, and ensured the successful completion of the marching mission.

The propaganda and mobilization work during marching should seize the opportunity and be effective at critical moments. Especially when the troops are in the most difficult, most challenging, and most fatigued situations, the power of propaganda and mobilization work should be fully utilized. Once, a certain regiment's fifth company marched in the wrong direction, and the troops walked an additional ten kilometers in snow several centimeters thick. Everyone's shoes and socks were wet, and some comrades had complaints. The cultural and entertainment team members then beat drums and sang: "Drums beat loudly to the sky, we come here to propagate, today although we took the wrong path, everyone should not complain. We did not waste our efforts, we gained more training. Stay calm, take a smoke, rest and then move forward." After this song, everyone's morale was boosted again. In one company, when crossing a river, some soldiers hesitated. The mobilizer then sang: "The river water laughs, asking the soldiers how to cross, in the past, the Red Army crossed the Wujiang River, bravely crossing the Dadu River, the people's warriors have high spirits, what is a small river?" As the mobilization ended, the company ordered the crossing of the river, and the soldiers quickly crossed over.

The propaganda and mobilization work during marching must fully mobilize the masses, ensuring that everyone participates and does propaganda and mobilization work. Due to the arduous marching tasks and changing situations, propaganda and mobilization work cannot be done by a few people. Everyone must be mobilized to participate, with everyone speaking up and encouraging each other, to create a situation where there is propaganda and mobilization everywhere and at all times.

In propaganda and mobilization work, the most powerful weapon is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's words are all truths, with the highest authority and greatest power, one sentence is worth a million. The propaganda and mobilization during marching mainly target active thoughts, propagating Chairman Mao's words, and using Chairman Mao's teachings to inspire everyone. Many companies broadcast Chairman Mao's quotations during marching, sang songs composed with Chairman Mao's quotations, and hung Chairman Mao's quotations on backpacks, along the marching route, and on buildings and trees. Wherever Chairman Mao's teachings go, there is a great inspiring force. Once, a certain regiment's first company was marching at night when suddenly a strong wind blew and heavy snow fell, accumulating several centimeters in less than two hours. At this time, the party branch organized everyone to read Chairman Mao's teachings on facing difficulties. The more they walked, the higher their spirits, and the better they helped each other, not only overcoming the wind and snow but also completing the marching mission on time.

### 行军中的宣传、鼓动工作

专栏：谈谈解放军的连队行军政治工作3

    行军中的宣传、鼓动工作
    亲爱的红卫兵战士们，亲爱的革命小将们！今天，我们再来谈一谈行军中的宣传鼓动工作。宣传鼓动工作，是一种强有力的政治思想工作。人民解放军历来是重视宣传鼓动工作的。它有很强的战斗性和鼓动性。过去，不论是行军、打仗或是执行其他任务，连队的宣传鼓动工作，都搞得非常活跃。打仗的时候，就搞战场鼓动或火线鼓动。行军的时候也是走一路，宣传鼓动一路。这种宣传鼓动工作，大大激励了部队的战斗意志，使干部战士在任何艰难困苦的情况下，都始终精神焕发，斗志昂扬，朝气蓬勃，充满了革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神。对保证部队圆满地完成行军作战任务，起了很大的作用。
    行军中的宣传鼓动工作，大体上可以分两种情况：一种是战斗行军；一种是一般情况下的行军。战斗行军，任务紧急，要注意隐蔽，保持肃静。这时，特别需要进行简短的鼓动工作，提出有力的鼓动口号，使干部战士充满大无畏的革命英雄气概和对敌人的高度仇恨心，排除万难，勇猛前进。举一个中国人民志愿军在朝鲜作战的例子。有一次，志愿军某部三营，接受了深入敌人后方，猛插道峰山的光荣任务。营连干部领受任务后，距离出发时间只有十几分钟，他们就边走边动员，简明地把上级的作战意图和完成这次穿插任务的意义，给每个战士讲清楚。同时，还提出了有力的鼓动口号，要战士们“打好！走好！”“边打边走，钻到敌人心脏中去！”“好党员、好团员、好战士到道峰山上去立功！”全营人员树立了一个决心，一个观念，一个目的：“到道峰山上去立功！”穿插路上，好多战士在这样明确的鼓动口号下，纷纷表示决心：“爬也要爬到道峰山上去！”有的战士表示：“只要有一口气，就要打到道峰山去！”这种旺盛的战斗情绪，保证了全营在短时间内，突破敌人七道阻拦，前进一百二十里，胜利插上了道峰山。在中印边界自卫反击战中，我边防部队某部二连，担任远距离迂回包围敌人的任务。部队在崎岖不平的山道上，日夜兼程，肃静前进。在这种情况下，他们的宣传鼓动工作仍然非常活跃。行军中，利用小休息的机会，由班长进行简短讲评，夜行军中，小声地宣扬行军中的好人好事。有时还用传口令的办法，鼓励战士在艰苦时要战胜困难，过得硬。例如：“往后传，艰苦就是光荣，顽强就是胜利！”“想想自己的决心！”“别忘了给烈士报仇！”“跟上队，保持连队荣誉！”等等。在道路难走，战士十分疲劳时，连排干部还给大家讲《沙漠追匪记》等电影故事。战士们说：“在困难的时候，想想革命前辈，劲头就来了！”全连爬山涉水，喝冷水，吃干粮，连续行军四昼夜，情绪始终饱满，无一人掉队。
    在一般情况下行军，宣传鼓动工作，可以搞得更活跃。这时，可以采用多种多样的形式，开展文娱活动和宣传鼓动工作。如广播好人好事，讲战斗故事，讲光荣传统，演小节目，唱家乡戏，拉歌子，呼口号，写标语，在重点地方设鼓动棚等。例如，解放军某部在徒步行军中，由于路程远，天气热，各连都开展了拉歌、唱歌、赛歌、讲故事、说笑话等活动。每天从出发地到宿营地，歌声，口号声，此起彼伏，一片欢腾。大大鼓舞了指战员的行军情绪，大大减轻了部队的疲劳，保证圆满地完成了行军任务。
    行军中的宣传鼓动工作，要注意抓住时机，做到节骨眼上。特别是部队在最艰难最困苦最疲劳的时候，更要发挥宣传鼓动工作的威力。某部五连有一次行军走错了路，部队在几十厘米厚的雪地里多走了十几公里路，大家鞋袜都湿了，有的同志产生了埋怨情绪。文娱组的同志就敲锣打鼓地唱起来：“敲起锣鼓响连天，我们这里来宣传，今天虽然走错了路，大家不要闹意见。我们没有白费劲，额外收获多锻炼。沉着气，抽口烟，养精蓄锐再向前。”这样一唱，大家的情绪又都高涨起来。有的连队在强渡江河时，有人表现犹豫。鼓动员就唱道：“河水哗哗发笑声，笑问战士怎么过，当年红军过乌江，奋勇强渡大渡河，人民战士志气高，小小江河算什么。”鼓动声刚落，连里下令强渡江河，战士们都迅速地渡了过去。
    行军中的宣传鼓动工作，一定要充分发动群众，做到人人开口，人人做宣传鼓动工作。由于行军任务艰巨，情况多变，宣传鼓动工作只靠少数人是做不好的。一定要发动大家来做，人人开口，互相鼓励，才能搞得热火朝天，形成处处有宣传鼓动，时时有宣传鼓动的局面。
    在宣传鼓动工作中，最有力的武器是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。毛主席的话句句是真理，威信最高，威力最大，一句顶一万句。行军中的宣传鼓动，主要是针对活思想，宣传毛主席的话，用毛主席的教导去鼓舞大家。许多连队在行军路上广播毛主席的语录，唱用毛主席语录谱曲的歌子，在背包上，在行军路旁的建筑物和树上张贴毛主席语录。毛主席的教导传到哪里，哪里就产生巨大的鼓舞力量。某部一连在夜间行军时，突然狂风四起，大雪纷飞，不到两个小时，就下了几十厘米厚。这时党支部就组织大家朗读毛主席关于对待困难的教导，大家越走情绪越高，团结互助搞得越好，不仅战胜了风雪严寒，而且按时完成了行军任务。（附图片）
