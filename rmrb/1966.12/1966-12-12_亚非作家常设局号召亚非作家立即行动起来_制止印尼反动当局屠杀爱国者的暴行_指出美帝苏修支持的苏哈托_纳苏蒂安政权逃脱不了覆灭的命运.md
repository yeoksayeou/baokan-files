The Afro-Asian Writers' Association urges Afro-Asian writers to take immediate action to stop the Indonesian reactionary regime's massacre of patriots and points out that the Suharto-Nasution regime, supported by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, cannot escape its doom.

Chairman Mao said, "The various oppressions inflicted by the reactionaries of all countries on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote broader and more violent revolutions among the people."

New China News Agency, December 11th: The Afro-Asian Writers' Association issued a statement today, fully supporting the recent urgent appeal by the Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organization in Indonesia to all progressive and democratic people around the world to actively rescue the 300,000 Indonesian patriots illegally imprisoned by the Indonesian fascist military regime. The statement calls on Afro-Asian writers to take immediate action to thoroughly expose the atrocities of the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime, which is backed by the U.S. imperialist and Soviet revisionist cliques, and to strive to the utmost to rescue Indonesian patriots and fight to the end.

The statement said that the right-wing military regime in Indonesia has been ruthlessly persecuting patriots and brutally massacring hundreds of thousands of people. The Suharto-Nasution fascist regime has actively followed and aligned itself with U.S. imperialism in its foreign relations, launching an unprecedentedly savage anti-China and anti-Chinese racist movement, making the world's strongest bastion and center of revolution—China—their number one enemy. They have already integrated politically, economically, and militarily into the U.S. imperialist strategic system in Asia, blatantly betraying the interests of the Indonesian people. The names Suharto and Nasution have become synonymous with fascist tyranny and imperialist lackeys.

The statement emphasized that while the Suharto-Nasution fascist clique was massacring patriotic progressive masses and communists on a large scale, Soviet revisionists continued to supply weapons to the Indonesian reactionary regime, handing the executioners their knives. This once again exposed the extremely ugly and ferocious face of the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique, the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, and showed that they are the number one traitor to the liberation cause of the Indonesian people and the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world.

The statement said that the brutal persecution and mad attacks by the Indonesian reactionaries can only further awaken the great Indonesian people and ignite an even broader revolutionary storm. If the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime and its handful of people insist on acting as imperialist lackeys and partners of Soviet revisionists abroad, and pursuing anti-communist, anti-people, anti-democratic, and racist policies at home, they will definitely not escape the historical punishment of the Indonesian people and will not escape their ultimate doom.

    亚非作家常设局号召亚非作家立即行动起来
    制止印尼反动当局屠杀爱国者的暴行
    指出美帝苏修支持的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安政权逃脱不了覆灭的命运
    毛主席说：“各国反动派……他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    新华社十一日讯　亚非作家常设局今天发表声明，表示完全支持印尼亚非人民团结组织最近要求全世界进步和民主人士积极拯救被印尼法西斯军事当局非法监禁的三十万印尼爱国者的紧急呼吁。声明号召亚非作家立即行动起来，彻底揭露在美帝和苏修领导集团支持下的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的暴行，竭尽全力为拯救印度尼西亚爱国者而斗争到底。
    声明说，印度尼西亚右派军人政权一直在疯狂地迫害爱国人士，残酷地屠杀了数十万人民。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权在对外关系上积极追随和投靠美帝国主义，掀起了空前未有的最野蛮的反华、反华侨的种族主义运动，把世界革命的最强大的堡垒和中心——中国，当做了他们的头号敌人。他们从政治、经济和军事上，已经纳入了美帝国主义在亚洲的战略体系，明目张胆地在出卖印度尼西亚人民的利益。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安的名字已经成为法西斯暴政和帝国主义走狗的代名词。
    声明强调指出，正当苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯集团大规模屠杀爱国进步群众和共产党人的时候，苏联修正主义者给印尼反动政权不断输送武器，向刽子手递上了屠刀。这就又一次清楚地暴露了苏联现代修正主义领导集团这个美帝的头号大帮凶的极端狰狞丑恶的面貌，说明了他们是印尼人民和亚、非、拉人民以及全世界人民解放事业的头号大叛徒。
    声明说，印尼反动派的残酷迫害和疯狂进攻，只能进一步促进印尼人民的伟大觉醒，只能激发起更加广泛的革命怒潮。如果苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权一小撮人仍旧坚持对外充当帝国主义走卒和苏联修正主义者的伙伴，对内推行反共反人民、反民主和种族主义的政策，一定逃脱不了印度尼西亚人民的历史惩罚，逃脱不了最后覆灭的命运。
