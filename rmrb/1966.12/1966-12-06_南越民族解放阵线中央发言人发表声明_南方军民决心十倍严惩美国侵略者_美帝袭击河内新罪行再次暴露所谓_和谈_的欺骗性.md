The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on December 4, strongly condemning the barbaric act of U.S. aggressor aircraft bombing residential areas in Hanoi.

The statement said that after suffering consecutive defeats in recent battles in areas such as Xining, Bolavieng, Long Phu, Saigon, Bien Hoa, Oitam, and northern Quang Nam Province, the U.S. imperialists are in a very awkward situation. On December 2, they brazenly bombed densely populated residential areas in the southern suburbs of Hanoi and two residential areas within the city. This is a very serious new escalation of the war, following the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong on June 29 this year, and is a blatant provocation against the Vietnamese people.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. imperialists foolishly believe that by using such despicable means, they can intimidate the patriotic spirit of the Vietnamese people and suppress the Vietnamese nation's fearless fighting spirit. But they are gravely mistaken. The heroic Vietnamese people are fearless and know only how to fight and defeat the enemy.

The statement said that the U.S. imperialists' attack on residential areas in the southern suburbs of Hanoi and two residential areas within the city once again exposed the deceitfulness of their so-called "peace talks" and "stopping the bombing."

The statement expressed firm support for the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 3, strongly condemning the U.S. government's extremely brutal new war escalation, and demanding that the U.S. imperialists immediately stop their heinous acts against all Vietnamese people, withdraw all U.S. and puppet troops from the South, and allow the Vietnamese people to decide their own internal affairs.

The statement said that the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam sternly warns the U.S. aggressors: their new "counteroffensive" plan in South Vietnam has been thoroughly defeated, and their new escalation against North Vietnam will only meet with even more disastrous failures. The military and people of the South are determined to fulfill their duties to the national rear, resolutely implement the call issued by the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on October 27 to "resolutely defeat the U.S. aggressors." The U.S. imperialists' aggression against Hanoi is an aggression against the heart of the Vietnamese nation. The military and people of the South are determined to punish them fivefold, tenfold. The actions of the Liberation Army on December 4, such as shelling the U.S. military base at New Mountain and destroying U.S. military barracks in Saigon, are heavy blows in retaliation for the compatriots in Hanoi and the North.

The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam reiterates: regardless of how vicious the new escalation actions the U.S. imperialists take, regardless of how much they intensify the war, regardless of whether the war lasts five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, the military and people of the South will resolutely, together with all compatriots in the country, overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifice, and are determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors. They will contribute to the struggle for national independence and freedom, and to the maintenance of peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

    南越民族解放阵线中央发言人发表声明
    南方军民决心十倍严惩美国侵略者
    美帝袭击河内新罪行再次暴露所谓“和谈”的欺骗性
    新华社河内五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会发言人，四日发表声明，强烈抗议美国强盗飞机轰炸河内市居民区的野蛮罪行。
    声明说，美帝国主义最近在西宁、波来吉浪、龙平、西贡、边和、油汀和广南省北部等地接连遭到失败以后，处境十分狼狈，于是又在十二月二日悍然轰炸河内市南郊的居民稠密区和市内的两个居民区。这是美帝国主义在今年六月二十九日轰炸河内和海防以后的极其严重的新战争“升级”行动，是对越南人民极其明目张胆的挑衅。
    声明指出，美帝国主义妄想以这种卑鄙手段，来威胁越南人民的爱国主义精神，压制越南民族不怕牺牲的战斗精神。但是它大错特错了。英雄的越南人民毫无畏惧，只知道战斗和战胜敌人。
    声明说，美帝国主义袭击河内市南郊的居民稠密区和市内两个居民区，再一次暴露了它的“和平谈判”、“停止轰炸”的欺骗性。
    声明表示坚决支持越南民主共和国外交部十二月三日的声明，强烈谴责美国当局的上述极残暴的新战争“升级”行动，并且要求美帝国主义必须立即停止对全体越南人民的罪恶滔天的行动，把美国侵略军和帮凶军全部撤出南方，让越南人民自己决定自己的内部事务。
    声明说，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会严厉警告美国侵略者：它在越南南方的新“反攻”计划，已经被打得落花流水，它对越南北方进行的新“升级”行动，也只能遭到更加惨重的失败。南方军民决心履行自己对全国大后方的义务，坚决实现越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团十月二十七日发出的“决心战胜美国强盗”的号召。美帝国主义侵犯河内，就是侵犯越南民族的心脏。南方军民决心五倍、十倍地严惩它。解放军十二月四日炮轰新山一美军机场、炸毁西贡美军宿舍等行动就是为河内同胞和北方同胞报仇而给美国侵略强盗的沉重打击。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会再一次重申：不管美帝国主义采取怎样恶毒的新“升级”行动，不管它把战争加强到什么程度，不管战争延长五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，南方军民都坚决同全国同胞一起，克服一切困难，不怕牺牲，决心战胜美国强盗，为争取祖国独立和自由，为维护东南亚和世界和平作出贡献。
