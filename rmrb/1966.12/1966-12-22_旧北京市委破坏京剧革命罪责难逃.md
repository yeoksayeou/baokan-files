	Editor's Note: Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the reforms of Peking opera, ballet, and symphonic music have achieved epoch-making successes in recent years, producing a series of brilliant revolutionary model operas. This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory for Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line.

	Victory does not come easily. It is the result of Comrade Jiang Qing and revolutionary literary and artistic workers resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, engaging in fierce struggles against the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, and breaking through the numerous obstacles, suppressions, and sabotages imposed by the old Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, and the old Beijing Municipal Committee. The birth of these revolutionary model operas shows that the class struggle in the literary and artistic field is extremely sharp and complex, and that the task of literary and artistic revolution is extremely arduous. We must continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly settle the accounts of the counter-revolutionary revisionist crimes of the old Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, and the old Beijing Municipal Committee, thoroughly eliminate their pernicious influences, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the literary and artistic circles through to the end!

	The Old Beijing Municipal Committee's Crime of Sabotaging the Peking Opera Revolution is Indisputable

	Beijing Peking Opera Troupe 1  Qunhong

	The class struggle in the literary and artistic circles has always been extremely sharp and complex. The old Beijing Municipal Committee, the old Propaganda Department, and the old Ministry of Culture have colluded with each other over the years, vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line and opposing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. They have one set of words and another set of actions, one set of soft tactics and another set of hard tactics, resisting Chairman Mao's instructions, sabotaging the reform of Peking opera, and committing heinous crimes against the Party and the people!

	Our Beijing Peking Opera Troupe 1 is the first unit in Beijing to undertake the glorious task of Peking opera reform. Comrade Jiang Qing began personally guiding our troupe to reform Peking opera and stage the revolutionary modern Peking opera "Sha Jianhu" at the end of 1963. However, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists led by the main responsible person of the old Beijing Municipal Committee harbored extreme hostility towards the Peking opera revolution. They created various difficulties for our Peking opera reform work, obstructing and sabotaging it in various ways.

	The revolutionary modern Peking opera "Sha Jianhu" was born under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. In the process of creating and revising the script, Comrade Jiang Qing conveyed Chairman Mao's instructions: to emphasize armed struggle, reflect the people's war thoughts, and strengthen the image of positive heroic characters. Comrade Jiang Qing specifically pointed out that the scene "Three Tea Houses" should be deleted as it disrupts the plot, the role of the negative character Xiao San should be reduced, and the image of the positive character Guo Jian Guang, the New Fourth Army commander, should be strengthened. However, Li Qi, the head of the old Beijing Municipal Committee's Propaganda Department, who carried out the instructions of the main responsible person of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, openly resisted Chairman Mao's instructions and ordered our troupe's former party branch secretary to retain "Three Tea Houses." The bourgeois reactionary "authorities" within the troupe also colluded with them, refusing to change the play. They stubbornly resisted for four months.

	Comrade Jiang Qing has repeatedly pointed out that male dan actors cannot perform revolutionary modern plays. Male dan is a product of feudal society, and its appearance on the socialist stage is an anomaly. Male dan performing revolutionary modern plays can only be disruptive. However, the main responsible person of the old Beijing Municipal Committee openly opposed this, saying that someone sings well and people want to listen. The former party branch secretary of our troupe colluded with them, writing scripts and arranging performances for male dan actors. In 1964, they went to great lengths to have a certain male dan actor perform "Reed Fire." In 1965, they hatched a new plot, with the main responsible person of the old Beijing Municipal Committee personally ordering the transfer of this male dan actor to Peking Opera Troupe 2, and publicly stating that he "can perform some old plays." When this male dan actor performed a revolutionary modern play in the theater, some old remnants in the audience cheered loudly, causing a bad influence. It is clear that their goal was to preserve their strength and, when the time was ripe, carry out a capitalist restoration, allowing emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties to return to the stage.

	Comrade Jiang Qing has clearly stated: "Peking Opera Troupe 1's experiment with revolutionary modern plays must not perform old plays." She also said: "After more than ten years of liberation, are we still performing plays about landlord heads and landlord wives? Is that not shameful? ... I am resolute on these plays!" Hearing Comrade Jiang Qing's words, every revolutionary comrade became even more determined to carry out the Peking opera revolution, to eliminate bourgeois elements and promote proletarian elements, and to struggle for the creation of new proletarian literature and art. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee spared no effort to sabotage the Peking opera revolution. In June 1965, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Li Qi and the former party branch secretary of our troupe colluded to have some bourgeois "authorities" in our troupe plot to open up "old plays." When the second team of our troupe went to Shanxi to participate in the North China Region Modern Peking Opera Performance, they performed modern plays during the day, and Li Qi personally named them to sing old plays at night. They also kept fifty old play props in the troupe, with enough costumes to perform all the old plays. The former party branch secretary of our troupe even more brazenly had young actors practice old plays and incited old artists to prepare to perform old plays. They harbored deep hatred for revolutionary modern Peking opera, attempting to seize leadership in the literary and artistic field and realize a capitalist restoration!

	Now is the time to thoroughly settle the accounts of these demons and monsters. Chairman Mao teaches us, "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame by learning from King Xiang Yu." We must thoroughly expose and criticize the collusion of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, the old Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, and the former party branch secretary of Peking Opera Troupe 1 in sabotaging the Peking opera revolution, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	We are determined to forever follow the Party, follow Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the Central Military Commission, the General Political Department, and Comrade Jiang Qing, to carry the Peking opera revolution through to the end, to dedicate our lives to the revolution, and to contribute everything we have to the creation of the most brilliant and radiant new proletarian literature and art!

    编者按：在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，京剧改革、芭蕾舞剧改革和交响音乐改革，近几年来取得了划时代的成就，出现了一批光芒四射的革命样板戏。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛主席文艺路线的伟大胜利。
    胜利得来不易。它是江青同志和革命文艺工作者坚决贯彻毛主席的文艺路线，同反革命修正主义文艺黑线进行激烈斗争，冲破旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委的重重阻挠、压制、破坏所取得的伟大成果。这些革命样板戏的诞生，表明了文艺战线上的阶级斗争十分尖锐、十分复杂，表明了文艺革命的任务是极其艰巨的。我们要继续高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，彻底清算旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委的反革命修正主义罪行，彻底清除他们的恶劣影响，把文艺界的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    旧北京市委破坏京剧革命罪责难逃
    北京京剧一团  群红
    文艺界的阶级斗争一直是十分尖锐复杂的。旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部长时期以来互相勾结，极力推行反革命修正主义文艺黑线，同毛主席的文艺路线相对抗。他们阴一套，阳一套，软一套，硬一套，抗拒毛主席的指示，破坏京剧改革，对党、对人民犯下了滔天罪行！
    我们北京京剧一团是北京首先接受京剧改革光荣任务的一个单位。江青同志在一九六三年底，就开始亲自指导我团进行京剧改革，排演革命现代京剧《沙家浜》。但是，以旧北京市委主要负责人为首的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，极端仇视京剧革命，他们对我们的京剧改革工作，制造种种困难，进行种种阻挠和破坏。
    革命现代京剧《沙家浜》，是在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下诞生的。在这个剧本的创作和修改过程中，江青同志传达了毛主席的指示：要突出武装斗争，体现人民战争思想，要加强正面英雄人物形象。江青同志具体指出，要删掉破坏剧情的“三茶馆”一场戏，削减反面人物刁小三的戏，加强正面人物新四军指导员郭建光的形象。但是执行旧北京市委主要负责人意旨的旧市委宣传部部长、反革命修正主义分子李琪，却公开抗拒毛主席的指示，叫我团前党总支主要负责人保留“三茶馆”。团内的资产阶级反动“权威”，也和他们勾结在一起，拒不改戏。他们硬顶软磨，达四个月之久。
    江青同志曾经不止一次地提出男旦演员不能演革命现代戏。男旦是封建社会的产物，在社会主义的舞台上出现是怪现象，男旦演革命现代戏只能是起破坏作用。但是旧北京市委主要负责人却公开反对，说什么某某人唱的好，有人愿意听。我团前党总支负责人和他们勾结在一起，为男旦写剧本安排演出。一九六四年，他们千方百计地让某男旦演员演出了《芦荡火种》。一九六五年，他们又耍弄新的阴谋，旧北京市委主要负责人亲自下令把这个男旦演员调到京剧二团去，还公开叫他“可以演点老戏”。这个男旦演员在剧场演革命现代戏时，台下一些遗老遗少怪声叫好，影响极坏。很明显，他们的目的就是要保存实力，一旦时机成熟，就进行资本主义复辟，让帝王将相、才子佳人重登舞台。
    江青同志曾经十分明确地提出：“京剧一团搞革命现代戏试验，决不能演老戏。”她又说：“解放十几年，还是演地主头子、地主婆子，不可耻吗？……我对这些戏是决绝了！”听了江青同志的话，我们每一个革命同志都更加坚定了进行京剧革命的决心，灭资兴无，为创造无产阶级的新文艺而斗争。但是旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团却不遗余力地破坏京剧革命。一九六五年六月，反革命修正主义分子李琪和我团前党总支负责人串通一气，让我团的一些资产阶级“权威”策划，阴谋开放“老戏”。我团二队到山西参加华北区京剧现代戏会演时，白天演现代戏，晚上李琪就亲自点名大唱旧戏。他们还在剧团内存留了五十出旧戏的戏箱，里面的戏衣足够开放全部的旧戏之用。我团前党总支负责人更明目张胆地让青年演员大练旧戏，并鼓动老艺人准备上演旧戏。他们就是这样对革命现代京剧怀着刻骨的仇恨，妄想夺取文艺方面的领导权，实现资本主义复辟！
    现在，是彻底清算这些牛鬼蛇神的罪行的时候了。毛主席教导我们“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。我们要彻底揭发批判旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部和北京京剧一团前党总支负责人相互勾结，破坏京剧革命的滔天罪行，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    我们决心永远跟着党，跟着毛主席，在中央军委、总政治部和江青同志的领导下，把京剧革命事业进行到底，干一辈子革命，为创造出最光辉灿烂的无产阶级新文艺贡献自己的一切！
