Young scientific and technical personnel and workers in the Shanghai Petroleum Fermentation and Dewaxing Experimental Group have established a new system of writing shift change logs using Mao Zedong Thought.

From the beginning of their work, this group encountered numerous difficulties. How to face these difficulties? The first person to write a shift change log took up this question by studying "Quelling the Mountains by Persistence." To inspire himself and encourage everyone's revolutionary will, he wrote the first quote from Chairman Mao on the first page of the shift change log: "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, and surmounting every difficulty to win victory." He vowed to overcome difficulties with the spirit of the old man who moved the mountains and complete the experimental work of the fermentation group.

After the experiment began, the work became somewhat chaotic. They studied Chairman Mao's works again with this issue in mind. Chairman Mao said: "It is necessary to grasp the progress of work at any time, exchange experiences, correct mistakes, and not wait for several months, half a year, or even a year to hold a summary meeting, settle accounts, and make overall corrections." From Chairman Mao's teachings, they realized that the chaos in work was mainly due to not summarizing and exchanging experiences in a timely manner, so the work could not be improved and had a lot of blind spots. After raising this issue in the shift change log, everyone followed Chairman Mao's teachings and conducted a summary after each experiment, then arranged the next experiment, making sure they had a clear understanding. This way, everyone's enthusiasm was aroused, blind spots were avoided, chaotic situations were overcome, and the experimental work was ensured to proceed smoothly.

The members of this group dared to reveal their thoughts when writing shift change logs and used Mao Zedong Thought to transform their subjective world. One comrade, after being transferred to work in the fermentation group, had a temporary mindset and was not proactive in his work. After studying a passage from "In Memory of Norman Bethune" that said, "We are all from the four corners of the country, united for a common revolutionary goal," he realized the great significance of the fermentation group's work, which is to make China's petroleum industry catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level. To complete this glorious mission, everyone needs to unite and strive together. With his thoughts elevated, he criticized his wrong views in the shift change log and actively participated in the experimental work, displaying enthusiasm and creativity. Because they encouraged and helped each other with Chairman Mao's quotes every day, praised achievements, and overcame shortcomings, all the members of the group were united as one.

    用毛泽东思想写交接班日记
    上海石油发酵脱蜡试验发酵组的青年科学技术人员和工人们，建立了用毛泽东思想写交接班日记的新制度。
    这个小组的工作一开始，就遇到了不少困难。怎样对待困难？第一个写交接班日记的同志，带着这个问题学习了《愚公移山》。为了激励自己和鼓舞大家的革命意志，他在交接班日记的第一页上，写了第一条毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他表示一定要拿出老愚公的精神来克服困难，完成发酵组的试验工作。
    试验开始以后，工作一度比较忙乱，他们又带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“必须随时掌握工作进程，交流经验，纠正错误，不要等数月、半年以至一年后，才开总结会，算总账，总的纠正。”从毛主席的教导中，他们认识到工作忙乱，主要是没有及时总结、交流经验，因此工作提不高，有很大的盲目性。他们在交接班日记中提出这个问题以后，大家就按照毛主席的教导，在一个试验结束以后，进行一次小结，然后再布置下一个试验，做到心中有数。这样，就调动了每个人的积极性，避免了盲目性，克服了忙乱现象，保证了试验工作的顺利进行。
    这个小组的同志，在写交接班日记时，敢于亮思想，用毛泽东思想改造自己的主观世界。有一个同志刚调到发酵组工作时，因为有临时观点，工作不够主动。学习了《为人民服务》中的一段语录“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了”以后，他认识到发酵组工作的重大意义，是使我国石油工业赶上和超过世界先进水平。为了完成这个光荣任务，需要大家团结一致，共同奋斗。思想认识提高了，他就在交接班日记中，主动地批判了自己的错误观点，并且在以后的试验工作中，发挥了积极性和创造性。由于每天都用毛主席语录来互相鼓励，互相帮助，发扬成绩，克服缺点，全组同志团结得像一个人一样。
