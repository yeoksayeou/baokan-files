The people of Yemen have deep feelings for Chairman Mao. They regard Chairman Mao as their great leader. A Yemeni friend named Al-Hafas replaced the landscape painting in his house with a portrait of Chairman Mao.

When a Chinese journalist asked him why he did this, he said: "Chairman Mao is not only yours, but also ours. Mao Zedong Thought is a common treasure for the progressive people of the whole world."

    毛主席也是我们的领袖
    也门人民对毛主席有着深厚的感情。他们把毛主席看成自己的伟大领袖。有一位名叫阿哈法斯的也门朋友把他屋子里挂着的风景画换上了毛主席像。
    当中国记者问他为什么这样做的时候，他说：“毛主席不仅是你们的，也是我们的。毛泽东思想是全世界进步人民的共同财富。”
