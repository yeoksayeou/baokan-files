Romanian newspapers on December 17th published a statement from the Romanian government condemning the U.S. bombing of Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The statement noted that the U.S. bombing of Hanoi is a highly dangerous step in the U.S. imperialists' escalation of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The statement reaffirmed that the Romanian people and government are determined to provide comprehensive political, material, and moral support to the Vietnamese people until they ultimately defeat the U.S. aggressors.

The statement said that the Romanian people and government were outraged to learn that U.S. aircraft had conducted new barbaric bombings of residential areas in Hanoi, resulting in many civilian casualties and property damage. During the air raid on December 14th, the diplomatic quarter of Hanoi, including the Romanian Embassy, was also bombed. The statement pointed out that the U.S. bombing of Hanoi once again exposed the hypocrisy of the U.S. leaders' so-called "peaceful intentions."

The statement said that the Romanian government fully supports the statement issued by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 14th, demanding that the United States immediately stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, cease its aggression against Vietnam, and withdraw its troops from Vietnam.

The statement concluded by saying that the Romanian people and government firmly believe that the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity will ultimately triumph.
