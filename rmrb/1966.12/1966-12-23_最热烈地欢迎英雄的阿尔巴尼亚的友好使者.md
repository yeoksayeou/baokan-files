We are filled with excitement and joy as we extend our warmest welcome to the friendly envoys from the heroic country of Albania—the Albanian People's Republic National Song and Dance Ensemble—who are visiting our country for a tour.

Chairman Mao said, "'Though we are separated by mountains and seas, our hearts are united.' Although China and Albania are far apart, our hearts are connected." This June, our Beijing Song and Dance Ensemble, led by Premier Zhou Enlai, visited the heroic country of Albania for more than a month. Everywhere we went, whether in cities or villages, people dressed in festive attire would surge towards us like a tide from all directions. Shouts of "Enver—Mao Zedong" and "Mao Zedong—Enver" echoed, along with songs of "Beijing—Tirana," creating a joyous atmosphere. Whenever we performed dances symbolizing Sino-Albanian friendship and images of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver appeared on stage, the audience would stand up and cheer, with cries of "Enver—Mao Zedong" and "Mao Zedong—Enver" resonating through the air, never ceasing.

The fraternal Albanian people have an unparalleled deep friendship with our people and an infinite love and respect for our great leader, Chairman Mao. The Albanian people all yearn for a badge with Chairman Mao's image, but we did not bring enough, and many people did not get one. We said, "We are sorry, we have run out." They pointed to their chests and said, "It's okay, Chairman Mao is in our hearts!" Even toddlers who had just started speaking would shout "Mao Zedong" when they saw us. The Albanian people love Chairman Mao's works immensely, and everywhere you can see people organizing themselves to study Chairman Mao's works conscientiously. During our more than a month-long visit to Albania, we deeply felt the combat friendship forged by Mao Zedong and Enver, based on Marxism-Leninism.

Our great leader, Chairman Mao, said, "Heroic Albania, a great beacon of socialism in Europe." During our visit, it was also the time when the Albanian people were enthusiastically responding to and implementing the five revolutionary measures proposed by the Albanian Party of Labour. Everywhere we went, we saw leaders from the central government, district committee secretaries, and ordinary workers and soldiers laboring together. We went to agricultural reclamation areas and saw people from all over joyfully and diligently working; we went to border areas and saw people holding hoes in one hand and guns in the other, building a prosperous socialist homeland and fighting against and crushing the enemy's provocations; we went to border outposts and saw the soldiers of the People's Army laughing and talking with us about the ugly faces of imperialism and modern revisionism. Albanian artists often go to factories and villages to perform, supporting the Party's central tasks. In Tirana, we had the opportunity to watch a song and dance evening full of revolutionary passion and the ballet "Red Detachment of Women." All of this left a profound impression on us. We are proud and honored to have such steadfast and fearless friends like Albania.

When we were about to leave heroic Albania, Comrade Shehu said to us, "No matter how high the mountains are, how deep the seas are, or how far the roads are, they cannot block the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!" Indeed, this time, led by Director Ba Pejo and Deputy Director Ro Hadro, the Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble, carrying the deep friendship of two million Albanian people, came to our country for a visit and performance, once again uniting the combat friendship between our two peoples. We once again extend our warmest welcome. We wish the Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble a successful performance.

    最热烈地欢迎英雄的阿尔巴尼亚的友好使者
    王前
    我们满怀激动而兴奋的心情，最热烈地欢迎来自英雄国家的友好使者——阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国国家歌舞团到我国进行访问演出。
    毛主席说：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”今年六月，我们北京歌舞团随同我国总理周恩来同志，到英雄的阿尔巴尼亚进行了一个多月的访问演出。我们每到一个城市或村镇，穿着节日的盛装的人群，就像潮水一样从四面八方向我们拥来，“恩维尔—毛泽东”“毛泽东—恩维尔”的欢呼声，“北京—地拉那”的歌声，此起彼落，一片欢腾。每当我们演出中阿友谊舞，在舞台上出现毛主席和霍查同志的画像时，人们起立欢呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东”“毛泽东—恩维尔”的声音响彻云霄，经久不息。
    兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民对我国人民有着无比深厚的战斗友情，对我们伟大的领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限崇敬。阿尔巴尼亚人民都渴望得到一枚毛主席像纪念章，而我们带的没有那么多，许多人没有能够得到。我们说：“很对不起！没有了。”他们指指胸口说：“没关系，毛主席在我的心里！”连刚刚会说话的两三岁的孩子，见着我们就喊“毛泽东”，“毛泽东”。阿尔巴尼亚人民无限热爱毛主席著作，到处可以见到人们自动组织起来，自觉地认真地学习毛主席著作。在我们访问阿尔巴尼亚的一个多月中，深深地感受到由毛泽东、恩维尔亲手缔造的建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的战斗友情。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”在我们访问的时候，也正是阿尔巴尼亚全国人民热烈响应与贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党所提出的五项革命措施的时候。到处可以看到从中央首长、区委书记到一般工作人员与工农兵在一起，共同劳动。我们走到农垦区，看到来自各地的人们在愉快而辛勤的劳动着；我们走到边防区，看到人们一手拿镐，一手拿枪，为建设富强的社会主义祖国，打击、粉碎敌人的挑衅而战斗着；我们走到边防哨卡，人民军的战士们和我们一起笑谈帝国主义、现代修正主义纸老虎的丑态。阿尔巴尼亚的文艺工作者，经常深入到工厂、农村，为配合党的中心任务而进行演出。我们在地拉那还有机会看了他们一场充满革命激情的歌舞晚会和芭蕾舞《红色娘子军》。所有这些，都给我们留下了极其深刻的印象。我们有像阿尔巴尼亚这样坚定无畏的朋友，感到十分骄傲和光荣。
    在我们将要离开英雄的阿尔巴尼亚的时候，谢胡同志向我们说：“山再高，海再深，路再远，也挡不住中阿两国人民的战斗友谊！”的确是这样。这次由团长巴·佩约，副团长罗·哈多率领的阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团，满载着二百万阿尔巴尼亚人民深厚的友谊到我国来进行访问演出，又一次把我们两国人民的战斗友谊凝结在一起。我们再一次表示最热烈地欢迎。在此谨预祝阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团同志们演出成功。
