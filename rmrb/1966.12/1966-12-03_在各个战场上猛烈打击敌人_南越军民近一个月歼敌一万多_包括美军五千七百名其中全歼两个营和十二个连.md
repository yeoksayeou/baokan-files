Heroic South Vietnamese military and civilians, in response to the call issued by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in October to "resolutely defeat the American aggressors," have fiercely struck the enemy on all fronts in the past month, achieving magnificent victories. According to a battle report released by the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, from October 27 to November 26, the South Vietnamese military and civilians annihilated a total of 11,400 enemy troops.

The report announced that among the annihilated enemy troops were 5,700 American soldiers and 388 South Korean mercenary troops; two American battalions, twelve companies, one puppet battalion, nine companies, and twenty-three platoons of American and puppet troops were completely wiped out, while two American battalions, one puppet battalion, and twelve companies and five platoons of American and puppet troops were severely damaged. At the same time, the South Vietnamese military and civilians also shot down and destroyed seventy enemy aircraft, damaged sixteen, sank seven enemy ships, destroyed more than two hundred tanks and armored vehicles, and captured or destroyed 134 enemy strongholds and ammunition depots.

The report stated that in the past month, the South Vietnamese military and civilians have engaged in many large-scale battles, achieving great victories in places such as Xinheng, Bien Hoa, Kunshan, and Gia Lai, and have dealt heavy blows to the U.S. 1st Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 4th Infantry Division, 11th Independent Armored Brigade, and especially the 196th Infantry Brigade.

To support these large-scale battles, the South Vietnamese military and civilians launched a high tide of guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla forces and local troops fiercely attacked enemy supply lines, cutting off and destroying many important roads, and annihilating and tying down a large number of enemy forces on these roads. Guerrilla forces and local troops also penetrated deep into enemy rear bases to annihilate the enemy, capturing many enemy strongholds.

The report emphasized that the magnificent achievements of the South Vietnamese military and civilians in the past month show that the U.S. imperialists are having a harder time in the Vietnam War. The more American invaders that come in, the more are annihilated, and the more they fail.

Currently, the South Vietnamese military and civilians, on the basis of new victories, are full of fighting spirit and determined to achieve even greater victories.

According to a report by the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the liberation armed forces in various parts of South Vietnam have continued to bravely attack the enemy, annihilating many American and puppet troops and mercenary troops.

From November 13 to 19, the military and civilians of the New An-Ha Tien area continuously attacked enemy strongholds, completely annihilating four puppet companies.

From November 9 to 16, the guerrilla forces of Son Ha County in Quang Ngai Province continuously attacked three battalions of South Korean mercenary troops conducting "sweeping operations," killing and wounding 338 enemy troops and shooting down one helicopter.

In the past week, the guerrilla forces of Quang Nam and Vinh Thuan County bravely smashed large-scale "sweeping operations" by American and puppet troops, annihilating 219 enemy troops.

    在各个战场上猛烈打击敌人
    南越军民近一个月歼敌一万多
    包括美军五千七百名其中全歼两个营和十二个连
    新华社河内二日电　英雄的越南南方军民，响应越南南方民族解放阵线十月间发出的“决心战胜美国强盗”的号召，最近一个月来，在各个战场上猛烈打击敌人，取得了辉煌胜利。据越南南方解放通讯社发布的战绩公报说，从十月二十七日到十一月二十六日，南方军民共消灭敌人一万一千四百名。
    据公报宣布，在被消灭的敌人中包括美军五千七百名，南朝鲜帮凶军三百八十八名；全歼美军两个营、十二个连、伪军一个营、九个连和美伪军二十三个排，重创美军两个营、伪军一个营和美伪军十二个连五个排。同时，南方军民还击落和击毁敌机七十架，击伤十六架，击沉敌舰艇七艘，击毁坦克、装甲车二百多辆，攻克、捣毁敌据点和军火库一百三十四座。
    公报说，越南南方军民在一个来月中进行了许多场规模巨大的战斗，取得了西宁、边和、昆嵩、嘉莱等大捷，沉重地打击了美国第一步兵师、第二十五步兵师、第四步兵师、第十一独立装甲团、特别是第一九六步兵旅。
    为了配合上述大规模战斗，越南南方军民掀起了一个游击战争运动的高潮。游击队和地方部队猛烈袭击敌人各条交通线，切断和破坏了许多重要公路，并在这些公路上歼灭和牵制敌人大量有生力量。游击队和地方部队还深入敌人后方基地消灭敌人，攻克了敌人许多据点。
    公报强调指出，越南南方军民一个月来取得的辉煌战果表明，美帝国主义在侵越战争中，日子越来越不好过，美国侵略军进来得越多，被歼灭的也就越多，失败也就越惨。
    目前，越南南方军民在新的胜利的基础上，个个斗志昂扬，决心争取更大的胜利。
    据新华社河内一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方各地解放武装力量，最近继续勇猛进攻敌人，又歼灭许多美伪军和帮凶军。
