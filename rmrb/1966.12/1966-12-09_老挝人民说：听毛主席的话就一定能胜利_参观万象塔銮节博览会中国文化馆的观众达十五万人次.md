The Chinese Cultural Pavilion at the recent Vientiane That Luang Festival Exhibition has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Lao people, demonstrating their boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao Zedong. They enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought, congratulating the Chinese people on their tremendous achievements in all fields under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. In just seven days, from November 21 to 27, the pavilion attracted 150,000 visitors.

The display of Chairman Mao's works inside the pavilion was the most attractive. People often crowded around the plaster statue of Chairman Mao, eagerly reading his works, and enthusiastically requesting copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works, and poems. As soon as a batch of Chairman Mao's works was put out, they were quickly taken. Many visitors who obtained Chairman Mao's works unanimously expressed their determination to study his works carefully. Some visitors said, "Chairman Mao's works are powerful weapons against imperialism. We must learn to fight against imperialism." "Reading Chairman Mao's books is not just for a few days, months, or years, but for a lifetime." Some visitors said they would take Chairman Mao's books back to study with their friends.

Young people from Thailand, the Philippines, and other countries also flocked to the Chinese Pavilion to request Chairman Mao's works. Two workers from northeastern Thailand, after receiving Chairman Mao's works, excitedly said, "We need it very much." A Lao worker, after receiving several single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works, raised his thumb and joyfully shouted, "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong!"

The Lao people have great love and respect for our great leader Chairman Mao. They expressed their admiration in various ways. An elderly Lao man bowed deeply in front of Chairman Mao's statue to express his boundless admiration. Many visitors took photos in front of the large embroidered portrait of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards, which was hung in the center of the exhibition hall. The Lao people also requested portraits of Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao badges from the Chinese Pavilion staff. Many visitors immediately pinned the Chairman Mao badges on their chests and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong!" A black friend from the Pacific Islands requested twenty portraits of Chairman Mao to send to his friends.

During the exhibition, the Chinese Pavilion also screened films every evening, attracting about 100,000 viewers. Documentaries such as "Chairman Mao with the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army" were particularly popular. Some Lao viewers said after watching Chinese films, "The Lao people will learn from your films and believe that the Lao people will definitely decide to fight like the Chinese people."

The Lao people highly praised the Chinese Pavilion's exhibition. Hundreds of visitors wrote enthusiastic comments in the Chinese Pavilion's guest book. They unanimously praised the Chinese Pavilion as the "best," "most lively," and "most attractive." Tao Su Phalasi, the representative of the Lao Patriotic Front in Vientiane, wrote in the guest book, "After visiting the exhibition of the People's Republic of China, I feel that the great achievements of the Chinese people in all aspects are completely due to the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the firm implementation of the policy of self-reliance." Many visitors from different professions unanimously shouted, "Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest leader of all the people in the world today!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Support China, support Mao Zedong!" "I fully support Chairman Mao Zedong, I love Chairman Mao Zedong very much!" "Wish Chairman Mao Zedong eternal life!" "Firmly believe, follow Chairman Mao's words, victory is ours!" and so on.

    老挝人民说：听毛主席的话就一定能胜利
    参观万象塔銮节博览会中国文化馆的观众达十五万人次
    最近在万象塔銮节博览会展出的中国文化馆，受到了老挝广大人民群众的热烈欢迎，显示了老挝人民对毛泽东主席的无限热爱和敬仰。他们热情地赞扬毛泽东思想，祝贺中国人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下在各条战线上取得了巨大成就。在从十一月二十一日到二十七日展出的短短的七天中，共有十五万人次参观了中国馆。
    展览馆里的毛主席著作陈列处最吸引人，人们经常拥挤地聚集在毛主席的石膏像前，如饥似渴地阅读着毛主席著作，并且热切地争相向中国馆工作人员索取《毛泽东选集》、毛主席著作单行本和诗词。一批批毛主席著作刚拿出来，转瞬间就索取一空。许多拿到毛主席著作的观众都不约而同地表示，他们一定要很好地学习毛主席著作。有的观众说：“毛主席著作是反对帝国主义的强有力武器，我们必须学会同帝国主义作斗争。”“读毛主席的书，不是只读几天几个月几年，而是要读一辈子。”有的观众表示他把毛主席的书带回去，同他的朋友一起学习。
    来自泰国、菲律宾及其他国家的一些青年，也纷纷向中国馆索取毛主席著作。两位来自泰国东北部的工人，在拿到了毛主席著作以后激动地说：“我们非常需要它。”一个老挝工人在得到了几本毛主席著作单行本后，翘起大拇指高兴地连声欢呼：“毛泽东，毛泽东！”
    老挝人民非常热爱和敬仰我们伟大的领袖毛主席，他们以各种不同的方式来表达他们的敬仰之情。一个老挝老大爷为了表达他对毛主席的无限爱戴，在毛主席像前深深行礼致敬。许多观众在悬挂在展览馆中央的毛主席接见红卫兵的巨幅绣像前拍照留念。老挝人民还纷纷向中国馆工作人员索取毛主席像和毛主席像章。许多观众拿到毛主席像章后，立即别在胸前，并满怀激情地欢呼：“毛泽东万岁！”一个来自太平洋岛屿的黑人朋友要求送给他二十幅毛主席像，好让他寄给他的朋友们。
    中国馆在展出期间，每天晚上还放映了电影，观众约达十万人次。《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》等纪录片最受观众的欢迎。一些老挝观众在看了中国电影以后说：“老挝人民将从你们的电影中吸取良好的经验，相信老挝人民一定会像中国人民那样下定决心去斗争。”
    老挝人民对中国馆的展出给予了高度的评价，数百名观众在中国馆留言簿上写下了热情洋溢的赞语。他们一致赞扬中国馆“最好”，“最有生气”和“最吸引人”。老挝爱国战线党驻万象代表陶苏·培拉西在留言簿上写道：“在参观了中华人民共和国展览馆以后，我感到中国人民在各方面取得的伟大成就，完全是由于在毛泽东思想的指引下，坚决实行自力更生政策的结果。”许多不同职业的观众异口同声地欢呼：“毛泽东主席是当代全世界人民最伟大的领袖！”“毛泽东万岁！”“支持中国，支持毛泽东！”“我完全拥护毛泽东主席，我很热爱毛泽东主席！”“祝毛泽东主席万寿无疆！”“坚定信心，听毛泽东的话，胜利是我们的。”等等。
