Last December, I came to the Second Brigade to take on the task of cleaning the pipes. When I first arrived, I thought this work was dirty and tiring, unworthy of my efforts, so I was not committed to it. After studying Chairman Mao's works, my thoughts underwent a significant change. Chairman Mao said: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people." This made me realize that being a pipe cleaner is also serving the people, and it is also glorious. If the pipes are not cleaned properly, normal production cannot be maintained. From then on, my work enthusiasm grew, and I no longer feared dirt or hardship.

How to deal with difficulties?

In March of this year, we cleaned the pipelines. The pipes had already been buried and covered with soil, but because water had entered the pipes and they were not thoroughly cleaned, it caused a rework incident. The brigade decided to open a hole in the place where there was water to drain it. Since I am small in stature, I was asked to crawl into the pipe and carry out the water bucket by bucket. Together with Lu Anquan, we carried over fifty buckets, cleaning this section of the pipe. At that time, I continued to crawl into the pipe, checking as I went, and found water droplets inside. I thought that the other end of the pipe might still have water. If the water was not removed, it would affect the quality. To be responsible for the quality to the end, I decided to crawl in and check if there was any water. After crawling through six or seven pipes, I didn't see any water. I thought there was no water, but my knees were hurting, so I decided to come out. However, at that moment, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade does." I thought, if I retreat at the sight of difficulties, I am not a good comrade, not a good student of Chairman Mao. So, I decided to continue crawling forward.

Should I be responsible?

After crawling through twenty to twenty-one pipes, I still didn't see any water, and I began to feel discouraged. At the same time, I started to feel afraid. This pipeline is a long section covered with soil, with only one skylight. I had heard people say that if you stay inside the pipeline for too long, you might suffocate. Just as I was hesitating, I thought of the article "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." The old man Qu was not afraid of difficulties and moved two big mountains. Why couldn't I make up my mind to continue forward and see for myself? With this thought, I gained boundless strength and continued to crawl forward.

After crawling through twenty-eight to thirty pipes, I found a lot of water inside. At that time, I started to wonder: how could I remove so much water? I thought: I am responsible for cleaning the pipes, and if I clean the pipes thoroughly, I have fulfilled my duty. If there is water inside, it is the responsibility of the team leader and the brigade leader, what does it have to do with me? This water was irresponsibly let in by them, so they should come in and remove the water. At that moment, I did not want to remove the water. Just as my thoughts were in fierce struggle, I once again thought of Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy, must be in the interest of the people. If there are errors, they must be corrected, this is what it means to be responsible to the people." The water in the pipe should be removed, and if the water is not removed, it is irresponsible to the country and the people. Thinking of this, I gathered my courage and carried out over two hundred buckets of water, finally cleaning the pipe.

At that time, I thought, since this section of the pipe has water, does the previous section of the elbow pipe also have water? If the water is not removed, it will affect the entire pipeline in the future, and the loss would be even greater. I thought of the quality as the lifeline of the pipeline, and I must be responsible for the quality to the end, so I decided to check it out. Therefore, I continued to crawl forward.

Dare to take risks or not?

When I crawled to the elbow pipe, I again felt afraid: first, I was afraid of the heat and the strong smell of paint inside the pipe, and my mouth was very dry, staying too long would make it hard to breathe; second, I was afraid the pipe was slippery and I wouldn't be able to climb out of the elbow; third, I was afraid the pipe was full of water, and if I slipped into the water, I would drown; fourth, I was afraid that if I went down and had difficulty breathing, no one would hear me, and I wouldn't be able to climb out, and I would suffocate inside. In the end, it came down to whether I dared to go down or not, whether I was afraid of death or not. At this critical moment, my thoughts were in fierce struggle. I immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Thinking of the heroic deeds of model worker Wang Zhishun who was not afraid of death, I mustered my strength and crawled down, all the way to the other side of the river. After a thorough inspection, I found no problems, so I was relieved and prepared to crawl back.

However, this section of the elbow pipe had a steep slope, making it easy to crawl down but hard to climb up. After trying twice, I still couldn't climb up, my heart was pounding, and beads of sweat poured down my face and body. I shouted a few times, but no one heard me. I thought, this is it, feeling weak all over. At that moment, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades, in times of difficulty, must see achievements, see the light, and raise our courage." Like seedlings getting dew, my spirit was revived. How to get out? After getting rid of the fear, my mind calmed down, and I thought of a way. I took off my gloves and hat, placed them under my knees, and climbed step by step, finally making it out.

After climbing out, I saw that the pipe was not completely cleaned, but I heard that there would be a movie screening in the evening, so I didn't want to continue. I told Lu Anquan: I am very thirsty, my head is spinning, let's do this bit tomorrow! Lu Anquan said to me: "Persist in cleaning it thoroughly before coming out! You always say you want to learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and focus on the 'use' part. If you don't thoroughly clean the pipe today, the pipe cannot be welded, and tomorrow will delay a day of assembly and welding." Thinking carefully, I felt he was right, so I accepted his advice and decided to persist. I continued until around 7:30 PM before coming out. Because I stayed inside the pipe for over five hours, I felt dizzy and unsteady when I came out. At that time, the weather was very cold, but I had Mao Zedong Thought guiding me, completing the task, and I felt very happy, so I didn't feel cold, thirsty, or tired. That day, although I didn't sleep until after midnight, I still went to work as usual the next morning.

If you ask me why I could do this, I feel that the most fundamental reason is that Mao Zedong Thought has taken root in my mind. Chairman Mao's words are all truths. By studying them in conjunction with reality, applying what you learn, especially using them to transform your thoughts, you will have boundless energy and no difficulties that cannot be overcome.

    步步离不开毛泽东思想
    舒心懿
    去年十二月我来到二大队，担负清扫管子的工作。刚来时，我嫌这工作又脏又累，没“出息”，因此对工作不安心。学习了毛主席著作以后，我的思想起了很大变化。毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。这使我认识到：当管工也是为人民服务，也很光荣。如果不把管子打扫干净，就不能保持正常生产。从这以后，我的工作劲头越来越大，再也不怕脏、不怕苦了。
    碰到困难怎么办？
    今年三月，我们清理管线。管线已经埋下去，填了土，由于管子里面进了水，没有彻底搞干净，造成了返工事故。队上决定在有水的地方开一个口放水，我个子小，就叫我钻进管子里把水一桶一桶地提出来。我和陆安全一道提了五十多桶，把这一段管子搞干净了。这时，我又往管子里继续爬，边爬边看，又发现管子里面有水珠。我想，管子的那一头可能还有水。如果不把水提出来，就会影响质量。为了对质量负责到底，我决心钻进去检查，看看有没有水？爬了六、七根管子没有看见水。心想没有水了，膝盖头又跪痛了，还是出去算了。但是，这时候我想起了毛主席的教导。毛主席说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”我想，碰到困难就打退堂鼓，就不是好同志，就不是毛主席的好学生。于是我又坚持往前爬。
    该不该我负责？
    爬了二十到二十一根管子，还是没有见到水，我就有些灰心了，同时，又产生了怕的思想。这条管线很长一段上面都盖了泥土，只有一个天窗。平时听有的人说：人在管线里面工作的时间久了，就会憋死在里面。正在犹豫不决的时候，我又想起了《愚公移山》这篇文章。愚公这个老人不怕困难，把两座大山搬掉了，我为什么不能下定决心继续前进，去看一个究竟呢？这样一想，就增加了无穷的力量，坚持爬下去。
    一直爬到二十八到三十根管子，发现管子里面有很多水。这时，我就嘀咕开了：这样多的水怎么弄出去呢？我想：我是清扫管子的，把管子打扫干净了，就算尽到了责任。里面有水，这是组长、队长的事情，与自己有啥关系？这是他们不负责任放进来的水，应该由他们进来把水弄干净。这时候我的思想上就不想弄水了。正在思想斗争很激烈的时候，我又一次想起了毛主席的教导。毛主席说：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”管子里进去了水，就应该把水弄出来，如果不把水弄出来，这就是对国家、对人民不负责任。想到这些，我就鼓起勇气，一直提了两百多桶水，终于把管子搞干净了。
    这时候我又想，既然这段管子里有水，前面那一段弯管里是否也有水呢？如果有水不弄干净，将来就会弄得全管线都有水，那损失就更大了。我想到质量是管线的命根子，一定要对质量负责到底，就决定去检查一遍。于是我继续向前爬去。
    敢不敢冒风险？
    当我爬到快下弯管子的时候，思想上又产生了“怕”：一怕管子里闷热，油漆味难闻，口也渴得厉害，时间呆长了，就会感到呼吸困难；二怕管子滑，下到弯道里爬不上来；三怕管子里装满了水，滑到水里就会淹死；四怕下去以后，呼吸困难的时候，喊不应，爬不出，会闷死在里面。归根到底，敢不敢下去就是怕不怕死的问题。在这个关键时刻，思想斗争非常激烈。我马上想到毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”想起标兵王芝顺不怕死的英雄事迹，我就一股劲地爬了下去，一直爬到河对面。经过周密检查，没有发现什么问题，我就放心了，准备往回爬。
    但是，这段弯管坡度较大，爬得下去，却爬不上来了。爬了两次都没有爬上来，我的心里咚咚直跳，大颗的汗珠从头上、身上冒了出来，我大声喊了几声，根本喊不应。心想这下完了，感到浑身无力。这时候，想到毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”就像禾苗得了雨露一样，我的精神重新振作起来。怎么出去呢？打掉了“怕”字，脑子冷静了，办法也就想出来了。我把手套和帽子拿下来，垫在膝头上，一步一步地爬，终于爬了上来。松口气还是干到底？
    爬上来以后，我看到管子还没有彻底扫干净，但是，听说晚上要演电影，就不想干了。我对陆安全同志说：我口渴得厉害，头也晕，这点活，明天来干吧！陆安全对我说：“坚持扫干净了再出来吧！你平时不是说要活学活用毛主席著作，在‘用’字上狠下功夫吗？如果今天不彻底扫清管子里的渣渣，管子不能焊接，明天就会耽误一天组装和焊接。”仔细一想，觉得他的话很对，我就接受了他的意见，决定坚持干下去。一直干到晚上七点多钟才出来。由于在管子里面呆了五个多小时，出来时，头有些晕，站不稳。当时天气很冷，但我脑子里有了毛泽东思想作指导，完成了任务，感到很高兴，也就不觉得冷了，口也不渴了，身体也不累了。这一天尽管晚上十二点多钟才睡觉，第二天早上我还是照常上班。
    要问我为什么能够做到这样？我感到最根本的一条，就是毛泽东思想在我头脑里起了作用。毛主席的书，句句是真理，结合实际去学，学了就用，特别是用来改造自己的思想，就会产生用不完的劲头，当然也就没有克服不了的困难。
