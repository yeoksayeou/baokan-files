Everything for the People's Interests, Wholeheartedly Serve the People

We should be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people, ...

		*From "Two Destinies of China" (April 23, 1945)*
		*Mao Zedong Selected Works, Volume 3, Page 1028*

Our army is entirely for the liberation of the people, working thoroughly for the people's interests.

		*From "In Memory of Norman Bethune" (December 21, 1939)*
		*Mao Zedong Selected Works, Volume 3, Page 1003*

Another prominent feature distinguishing the Communist Party from any other political party is that we maintain the closest ties with the broadest masses of the people. We wholeheartedly serve the people, never parting from them for a moment; we proceed from the people's interests and not from those of individuals or small groups; we combine responsibility to the people with responsibility to the Party's leading bodies; these are our starting points.

		*From "On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945)*
		*Mao Zedong Selected Works, Volume 3, Pages 1095-1096*

The criterion for everything the Communist Party says and does should be whether it conforms to the highest interests and demands of the broadest masses of the people.

		*From "On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945)*
		*Mao Zedong Selected Works, Volume 3, Page 1097*

Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness, his extreme dedication to his work, and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people, are all worthy of our learning. ...

We must all learn from his spirit of selflessness. From this point of view, one can become greatly beneficial to the people. A person's abilities may be great or small, but as long as he has this spirit, he is a person of noble character, a person of purity, a person of integrity, a person who has risen above petty interests, a person who is of benefit to the people.

		*From "In Memory of Norman Bethune" (December 21, 1939)*
		*Mao Zedong Selected Works, Volume 2, Pages 653-654*

Two lines from Lu Xun's poetry, "Frowning at a thousand accusing fingers, bowing down to be an ox for the children," should be our motto. "A thousand" here refers to the enemy. We will never yield to any vicious enemy. "Children" here refers to the proletariat and the masses. All Communists, all revolutionaries, all revolutionary literary and artistic workers, should learn from Lu Xun's example and be the "ox" for the proletariat and the masses, dedicating themselves wholeheartedly until death.

		*From "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" (May 1942)*
		*Mao Zedong Selected Works, Volume 3, Page 878*

To struggle means to make sacrifices, and death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, of the sufferings of the great majority of the people. To die for the people is a most glorious death. However, we should try our best to reduce unnecessary sacrifices.

		*From "In Memory of Norman Bethune" (September 8, 1944)*
		*Mao Zedong Selected Works, Volume 3, Page 1004*

People all die, but death has different meanings. The ancient Chinese historian Sima Qian said, "To die is as certain as the fall of autumn leaves, but one's death can be as heavy as Mount Tai or as light as a feather." To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai; to die for the fascists, to die for those who exploit and oppress the people, is lighter than a feather.

		*From "In Memory of Norman Bethune" (September 8, 1944)*
		*Mao Zedong Selected Works, Volume 3, Page 1003*

It is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life, never to do bad deeds, and always to be beneficial to the broad masses, always to be beneficial to the youth, always to be beneficial to the revolution, to struggle hard for decades as if it were just one day. This is the most difficult thing!

		*From "Congratulatory Words for Wu Yuzhang's 60th Birthday" (January 15, 1940)*
		*New China Daily, January 24, 1940*

All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people. What bad habits do we have that we cannot give up?

		*From "The Tasks for 1945" (December 15, 1944)*
		*Yan'an Liberation Daily, December 16, 1944*

Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy, must be in the people's interests. If there are any mistakes, they must be corrected. This is what it means to be responsible to the people.

		*From "The Current Situation and Our Policy After the Victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan" (August 13, 1945)*
		*Mao Zedong Selected Works, Volume 4, Page 1128*

Communists must always be ready to uphold the truth, because any truth is in the people's interests; Communists must always be ready to correct errors, because any error is not in the people's interests.

		*From "On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945)*
		*Mao Zedong Selected Works, Volume 3, Page 1096*

Communists who take the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people as their starting point believe that their cause is entirely just, and are willing to sacrifice everything personal for it, always ready to give their lives for our cause. Is there any thought, viewpoint, opinion, or method that does not meet the needs of the people and that we are reluctant to give up? Do we welcome any political dust or political microorganisms to soil our clean faces and corrode our healthy bodies? Countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person's heart ache when they think of them. Do we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any errors that we cannot abandon?

		*From "On Coalition Government" (April 24, 1945)*
		*Mao Zedong Selected Works, Volume 3, Pages 1097-1098*

Strive to do a good job in broadcasting for all the people of China and all the people of the world.

		*Inscription for the 20th Anniversary of the Founding of China's Broadcasting Industry*
		*People's Daily, December 9, 1965*

### 一切从人民群众的利益出发，全心全意为人民服务

专栏：毛主席关于群众路线的语录②

    一切从人民群众的利益出发，全心全意为人民服务
    我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务，……
             《两个中国之命运》（一九四五年四月二十三日）
                    《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一○二八页
    我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。
                        《为人民服务》（一九四四年九月八日）
                      《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一○○三页
    我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的又一个显著的标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系。全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；向人民负责和向党的领导机关负责的一致性；这些就是我们的出发点。
                  《论联合政府》（一九四五年四月二十四日）
            《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一○九五———一○九六页
    共产党人的一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。
               《论联合政府》（一九四五年四月二十四日）
                      《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一○九七页
    白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。…………
    我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。
                 《纪念白求恩》（一九三九年十二月二十一日）
                 《毛泽东选集》第二卷第六五三——六五四页
    鲁迅的两句诗，“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”，应该成为我们的座右铭。“千夫”在这里就是说敌人，对于无论什么凶恶的敌人我们决不屈服。“孺子”在这里就是说无产阶级和人民大众。一切共产党员，一切革命家，一切革命的文艺工作者，都应该学鲁迅的榜样，做无产阶级和人民大众的“牛”，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。
              《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》（一九四二年五月）
                    《毛泽东选集》第三卷第八七八页
    要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。不过，我们应当尽量地减少那些不必要的牺牲。
                 《为人民服务》（一九四四年九月八日）
                      《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一○○四页
    人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。中国古时候有个文学家叫做司马迁的说过：“人固有一死，或重于泰山，或轻于鸿毛。”为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。
                      《为人民服务》（一九四四年九月八日）
                          《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一○○三页
    一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，一贯地有益于广大群众，一贯地有益于青年，一贯地有益于革命，艰苦奋斗几十年如一日，这才是最难最难的呵！	　《吴玉章同志六十寿辰祝词》（一九四○年一月十五日）
                《新中华报》一九四○年一月二十四日
    我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？
               《一九四五年的任务》（一九四四年十二月十五日）
              延安《解放日报》一九四四年十二月十六日
    我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。
                      《抗日战争胜利后的时局和我们的方针》（一九四
                          五年八月十三日）
                        《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一二八页
    共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理，因为任何真理都是符合于人民利益的；共产党人必须随时准备修正错误，因为任何错误都是不符合于人民利益的。
                      《论联合政府》（一九四五年四月二十四日）
                      《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一○九六页
    以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道还有什么不适合人民需要的思想、观点、意见、办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？难道我们还欢迎任何政治的灰尘、政治的微生物来玷污我们的清洁的面貌和侵蚀我们的健全的肌体吗？无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？
                  《论联合政府》（一九四五年四月二十四日）
              《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一○九七——一○九八页
    努力办好广播，为全中国人民和全世界人民服务。
                      为中国广播事业创建二十周年的题词
                      《人民日报》一九六五年十二月九日
