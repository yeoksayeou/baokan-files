The largest agricultural chemical factory in Southwest China—the Chongqing Agricultural Chemicals Factory—has seen its workers actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. By promoting thought revolutionization, they have driven the entire factory's production to new heights, completing this year's national plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets. The factory has produced record-high quantities of six-six-six formulations, DDT emulsions, and other pesticides, with costs universally reduced and quality surpassing national standards.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers of the Chongqing Agricultural Chemicals Factory have focused on actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, vigorously combating the arrogance of bourgeois technical "authorities," and vigorously promoting technological innovations. Six years ago, workers in the six-six-six formulation workshop proposed modifying the Raymond mill, but this suggestion was rejected by some bourgeois "authorities" who claimed that foreign machinery should not be tampered with. During the Cultural Revolution, workers exposed the class struggle behind the suppression of this proposal and, within a short period, achieved this innovation. As a result, the factory's production of six-six-six formulations increased by about 50%, and the quality significantly improved.

    职工思想革命化  带动生产大发展
    重庆农药厂产品又多又好
    据新华社重庆电西南地区最大的农药厂——重庆农药厂广大职工，活学活用毛主席著作，以思想革命化带动全厂生产跃进，已经提前全面超额完成了今年的国家计划，生产的六六六制剂、滴滴涕乳剂、乐果等农药，产量达到了历史上的最高水平，成本普遍降低，质量也都超过国家规定标准。
    重庆农药厂的广大职工在无产阶级文化大革命中，大抓活学活用毛主席著作，大灭资产阶级技术“权威”的威风，大搞技术革新。六六六制剂车间工人在六年前就提出过改造雷蒙机的建议，却被一些资产阶级“权威”们所否定，认为洋机器摸不得。在文化大革命中，工人们揭开了这个建议被扼杀的阶级斗争的盖子，在短期内便实现了这项革新，使全厂六六六制剂的产量提高了百分之五十左右，质量也显著提高。
