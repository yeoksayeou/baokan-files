Our brigade's method of studying Chairman Mao's works is: combining the leading cadres and the broad masses, with cadres leading the masses and the masses urging the cadres. This is an effective way to organize and mobilize the masses to study.

The cadres in our brigade, under the leadership of the party branch and the influence of party members, generally study quite seriously. Everyone also regards leading and organizing the masses to study as a prominent political task and pays special attention to leading their families to study.

Cadres lead the masses to study, and in turn, the masses urge the cadres to study. My neighbor, seventy-year-old poor peasant Lu Yucheng, after listening to our family's sharing session on studying Chairman Mao's works, went back and led his grandchildren and granddaughter-in-law to study and discuss. Later, he invited me to listen, and I heard that they were doing well, so I held an on-site meeting at his home and invited the production team cadres to listen. The cadres, after listening, felt a great pressure and also stepped up their study and application.

The masses urge the cadres, mainly in the aspect of "application." After the mass study activities were launched, the cadres often fell behind the masses in the aspect of "application," especially in transforming their worldview. For example, both the first and sixth teams' rice had been harvested. The first team bought a threshing machine, and the threshing work proceeded smoothly; the sixth team's rice was threshed by hand, and the progress was slow. The team leader of the first team, Yin Guisen, wanted to finish threshing his team's rice quickly and then lend the threshing machine to the sixth team. However, the community members' thoughts went beyond his. The community members proposed to the team leader: "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serve the people, to be 'selfless' and 'dedicated to others.' We should lend the threshing machine to the sixth team earlier, and we can all help thresh the remaining rice in our team." The team leader deeply felt: "If we cadres do not study Chairman Mao's works well and change our thinking, we not only have no right to lead the community members but also hold them back!"

We realize that: for cadres, the process of leading the masses to study Chairman Mao's works is actually also a process of learning from the masses. We lead the masses, and the masses are mobilized, quickly surpassing us, urging us to move forward. The masses have cadres to lead, making it easier for them to take action; cadres have the masses to urge, making them run faster.

    群众促干部，跑得就更快
    江苏南通县新坝公社十九大队党支部书记  沙桂生
    我们大队学习毛主席著作的办法是：领导骨干和广大群众相结合，骨干带群众，群众促骨干。这是组织发动群众学习的一个有效办法。
    我们大队的干部，在支部的领导和党员的带动下，大多数学习都比较认真。大家也把带动和组织群众学习，作为突出的政治任务，并且特别注意带动家属学习。
    干部带动群众学，反过来群众又推动干部学。我的邻居、七十岁的老贫农陆玉成，听了我们全家学习毛主席著作的讲用会，回去以后也带领孙子、孙媳妇和小孙女儿学起来，讲起来。后来还约我去听，我一听，呱呱叫，就在他家开了现场会，请生产队干部去听。干部听了，感到压力很大，也就加紧学用起来了。
    群众促干部，主要表现在“用”字上。群众性的学习活动开展起来以后，干部在“用”字上，特别是在改造世界观方面，常常不如群众。譬如，一队和六队稻子都登了场。一队买了部打稻机，脱粒工作进行得很顺利；六队稻子靠人力掼，进度很慢。一队队长殷桂森，想把自己队里的稻子快点脱粒好了，再把打稻机借给六队。那知社员的思想走到他前面去了。社员向队长提出：“毛主席教导我们要‘完全’、‘彻底’地为人民服务，要‘毫不利己专门利人’，我们应该早点把打稻机借给六队，自己队里的一部分稻子大家掼。”队长深有体会地说：“我们做干部的不好好地学习毛主席著作，换换思想，不仅没资格领导社员，还要拖社员的后腿呐！”
    我们体会到：对干部来说，在学习毛主席著作中，带动群众的过程，其实也是向群众学习的过程。我们带动了群众，群众发动了起来，很快就超过了我们，促着我们再朝前跑。群众有了干部带，容易动起来；干部有了群众促，跑得就更快。
