A young man from West Africa who regularly listens to Beijing Radio has been attentively tuning in ever since the station began broadcasting Chairman Mao's quotations at the start of each program. Except for special occasions, he has consistently listened carefully. In the broadcasts, he heard that every Red Guard in China has a copy of "Chairman Mao's Quotations," and he eagerly desired to obtain such a precious book.

Soon, he acquired an English version of "Chairman Mao's Quotations." Holding the book, he looked up at his friends present and said, "I have obtained the revolutionary treasure! I am determined to learn from the revolutionary spirit of my Chinese Red Guard brothers and fight for the liberation of my homeland."

He then opened the cover of this red-covered treasure and, with deep emotion, gazed at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the title page. He exclaimed, "Great Chairman Mao, you are not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the oppressed peoples of the world. You always think of us and help us. We all respect and love you."

    学《语录》　闹革命
    一位经常收听北京电台广播的西非青年，自从北京电台在每节广播开始时播送毛主席语录以来，他除了有特别的事情以外，一直都认真收听。他在广播中听到每个中国红卫兵都有《毛主席语录》，于是他非常渴望也得到这样一本宝书。
    不久，他得到了一本英文版的《毛主席语录》，他拿起《毛主席语录》，仰着头对在场的朋友说：“我得到了革命的宝书！我决心学习我的中国红卫兵兄弟的革命精神，为争取祖国的解放而战斗。”
    他又打开这本红皮宝书的封面，深情地看着扉页上的毛主席像，激动地说：“伟大的毛主席呵，您不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是世界被压迫人民的伟大领袖。您总是想着我们，帮助我们。我们大家都尊敬您，热爱您。”
