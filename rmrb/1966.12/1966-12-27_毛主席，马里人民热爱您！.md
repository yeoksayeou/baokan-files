In October, a day came when the picture exhibition of the Da Zhai Brigade of the Da Zhai People's Commune in China was about to open in Bamako, the capital of Mali. The Chinese staff were busy setting up the exhibition hall. A Malian friend passing by the entrance saw this scene and immediately entered the hall, enthusiastically helping to move the pictures and chairs. After everything was moved, this unnamed Malian friend, adjusting his clothes, respectfully saluted the portrait of Chairman Mao displayed in the exhibition hall and solemnly said, "Chairman Mao, Aga Yi (meaning 'good' in Bambara)!"

On another occasion, a Malian friend received the first and fourth volumes of the French edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." He was overjoyed, holding the two precious books and saying, "Mao Zedong has provided the most correct answers to various problems of contemporary world revolution in his works. His books are universal truths. No one in contemporary times can compare with him. He is the representative of our era. I will read his works very carefully."

A Malian worker named Musa obtained a French edition of Chairman Mao's works, but since he did not understand French, he used his evenings to ask his elder brother, who understood French, to translate Chairman Mao's words into Bambara and read them to him. Not only did he listen himself, but his entire family listened as well. He also invited his friends to gather at his home under the lamp, all listening together to Chairman Mao's words. Every evening after reading a section, he would carefully lock the book in a box, and the next evening continue reading. Chairman Mao's book so powerfully attracted this ordinary Malian worker!

"Chairman Mao's book, once studied, must be put into practice; otherwise, it is worthless." These are the words of Kali Sidibe. Sidibe is a workshop director. He saw in Chairman Mao's book that to be a good teacher, one must first be a good student. From then on, every time there was a meeting, he would let the workers speak first, listening to the workers' opinions to improve his work. Chairman Mao said that cadres should participate in collective production labor, so he put on work clothes and, together with the workers, cleaned the workshop and often participated in other auxiliary labor.

    毛主席，马里人民热爱您！
    十月里的一天，中国大寨人民公社大寨大队图片展览会就要在马里首都巴马科开幕了，中国工作人员正在忙碌着布置会场。一位路过会场门前的马里朋友看到这番情景，立刻进入会场，热情地帮助搬运图片和椅子。当东西搬运完了之后，这位不知姓名的马里朋友，整了整衣服，向着展览会场内展出的毛主席照片，满怀敬意地敬了一个礼，并且庄重地说：“毛主席，阿嘎依（邦巴拉语好的意思）！”
    有一次，一位马里朋友得到《毛泽东选集》法文版第一卷和第四卷，他高兴极了，把两本宝书捧在手上说：“毛泽东在他的著作中对当代世界革命的种种问题作出了最正确的答案，他的书是普遍的真理，当代没有任何人能同他相比，他是我们这个时代的代表。我要很好地读他的著作。”
    一位名叫穆萨的马里工人得到了一本法文版的毛主席著作，但是他不懂法文，就利用晚上时间请他的懂法文的哥哥把毛主席的话译成邦巴拉语读给他听。不仅他自己听，他全家人都听，他还邀请了他的朋友聚集在他家的灯下，共同倾听毛主席的话。每天晚上读完了一段，他就把这本书珍贵地锁在箱子里，第二天晚上再接着读。毛主席的书多么有力地吸引着这位普通的马里工人！
      “毛主席的书，学了就要用，不用等于零”。这是卡利·西迪贝讲的话。西迪贝是一位车间主任，他看到毛主席的书上说过，要作好先生，首先要作好学生。以后每次开会他就先让工人发表意见，倾听工人的意见以改进工作。毛主席说干部要参加集体生产劳动，他就穿起工作服，同工人一起打扫车间的卫生，并且经常参加其他辅助劳动。
