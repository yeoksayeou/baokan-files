The mass struggles of Indian workers, peasants, and students against the reactionary government of the Indian National Congress are gaining momentum. Now, government employees across India are also rising up in rebellion.

The internal and external policies of the Indian National Congress government have reduced India to a state of poverty and financial ruin, with famine and death spreading across the land. The U.S. imperialists are taking advantage of this situation to further control India. Western media admits that the Johnson administration recently withheld 2 million tons of emergency relief grain that the Indian government desperately begged for, in order to force India to open its doors wider to U.S. capital. The Indian National Congress government, which has aligned itself with U.S. imperialism, has already oppressed the vast majority of the Indian people to the point of suffocation. The Indian people, including government employees, have no choice but to rise up and fight resolutely against them.

Chairman Mao said: “There is no room for compromise with the running dogs of imperialism... and their accomplices. Either we overthrow these enemies, or we are slaughtered and oppressed by them; there is no other way.” The Indian people are beginning to understand this truth in the midst of their brutal class struggle.

The Indian government is a tool of the Indian landlord and bourgeoisie for their reactionary rule. The struggle of Indian government employees for survival and against tyranny is throwing the reactionary machinery of the Indian rulers into serious disarray.

Storm clouds gather, winds sweep the tower. The reactionary policies of U.S. imperialism and the Indian reactionaries are creating a situation in India where the reactionaries can no longer rule as before, and the people can no longer live as before, leading to a great upheaval.

    山雨欲来风满楼
    印度工人、农民、学生反对国大党反动政府的群众斗争方兴未艾，印度政府的雇员又在全国范围内起来造反了。
    印度国大党政府的对内对外政策，把印度弄得民穷财尽，饿殍遍野。而美帝国主义又利用这种局势，进一步控制印度。西方报刊承认，约翰逊政府最近扣住印度政府紧急乞讨的两百万吨救灾粮食不给，是为了迫使印度对美国资本更加敞开大门。投靠美帝国主义的印度国大党政府，已经把印度广大人民压得喘不过气来了。印度人民，甚至政府的雇员，不能不起来和它们进行坚决的斗争。
    毛主席说：“和帝国主义的走狗……及其帮凶们决无妥协的余地，或者是推翻这些敌人，或者是被这些敌人所屠杀和压迫，二者必居其一，其他的道路是没有的。”印度人民在残酷的阶级斗争中正在懂得这个道理。
    印度的政府机构是印度大地主大资产阶级进行反动统治的一个工具。印度政府雇员的争生存、反暴政斗争，使印度反动派的统治机器陷入了严重的混乱。
    山雨欲来风满楼。美帝国主义和印度反动派的反动政策，正在使印度出现反动派再也不能照旧统治下去、人民再也不能生活下去的大动荡局面。
