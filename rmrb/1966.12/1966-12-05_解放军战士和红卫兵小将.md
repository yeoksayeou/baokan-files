November in Beijing, although it was early winter, the city was bustling with revolutionary fervor. Over 2.5 million Red Guards and revolutionary students from 28 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), representing dozens of ethnic groups, gathered in Beijing to receive the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao's Soldiers Love the Red Guards

On a winter night, the stars were bright in the sky. The lights of Beijing were even more brilliant. Here, the Red Guards, who were invited by Chairman Mao, were happily asleep. The PLA officers and soldiers who were hosting the Red Guards were very busy. In every reception station, they moved quietly among the rooms filled with sleeping Red Guards, covering up those who had kicked off their blankets, mending clothes and socks for the Red Guards. Many of them had not slept for two days and two nights, but at this moment, no one felt the slightest bit of sleepiness. Their hearts were filled with boundless happiness: being by Chairman Mao's side, hosting Chairman Mao's guests, they wished they had ten pairs of hands to serve the Red Guards. How could they sleep?

In a reception station in the Xicheng District, 23-year-old PLA squad leader, now serving as the Red Guards' platoon leader, Deng Yuejin, studied the "Three Articles" under the dim light of the hallway. He strictly examined himself to see if he had followed Chairman Mao's teachings to serve the Red Guards completely and thoroughly, just like Bai Qiuen and Zhang Zide. He treated these Red Guards as his own younger brothers and sisters, fearing they might catch a cold, and gave them his own quilts, mattresses, and cotton coats, leaving himself only a thin raincoat. He saw a Red Guard move slightly and his heart moved with him. Was the Red Guard still cold? Had he not done enough to be "selfless and devoted to others"? Deng Yuejin quickly covered the Red Guard with his raincoat. "As long as you are warm, I am warm," Deng Yuejin said to the sleeping Red Guard in his heart.

Deng Yuejin recalled his first night of field training. At that time, he had just enlisted. The team camped on a hilltop, and the weather was very cold. His squad leader came over and covered him with his own coat. He declined, but the squad leader gently said, "As long as you are warm, I am warm." The squad leader's words were not just a reflection of Chairman Mao's teachings of "selflessness and devotion to others," but also an embodiment of the traditions of the great leader Mao's personally created people's army. The squad leader's words stayed in his heart. Now, he was leading the Red Guards just like his squad leader. He also wanted to pass on Chairman Mao's teachings and the revolutionary traditions and styles of the PLA, which Chairman Mao personally created and cultivated, to the Red Guards!

It was very late at night. The political department director of a certain PLA unit, Yang Shuxing, had not yet slept. He was concerned about the Red Guards' comfort and personally checked every room where the Red Guards were staying. He saw that the PLA comrades were all sleeping fully clothed at the doorways, blocking the cold wind from entering the rooms and not letting a single cold breeze reach the Red Guards. He saw a Red Guard, bare-chested, about to go outside to relieve himself, and a soldier quickly gave him a cotton jacket to wear. He saw a 13 or 14-year-old little Red Guard kicking his blanket and murmuring in his sleep, "I want to see Chairman Mao, I want to see Chairman Mao!" What a good little Red Guard! Yang Shuxing was deeply moved. He thought: so young, so loving of Chairman Mao! So young, and already in Beijing to participate in revolutionary linking up, so concerned about national affairs! The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought shone brightly in this young generation. He couldn't help but recall his youth, when he was the same age as these Red Guards, and his body was not as tall as a three-eight rifle when he joined the Eighth Route Army. Like these Red Guards, his generation was daring, bold, and ready to fight. He had fought guerrilla warfare and trench warfare in the Hebei region, engaging in fierce battles with armed enemies. His youth was spent in war, and he grew up in the people's army that Chairman Mao personally created. Chairman Mao had personally cultivated them. Now, in this new historical period, the revolutionary young generation, with even higher revolutionary consciousness, was engaged in sharp struggles with unarmed enemies in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao was personally cultivating this revolutionary generation! Chairman Mao hoped they would lead this revolutionary young generation. Millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause were growing up in the storms of class struggle.

Yang Shuxing, with his emotions surging, thought: In just three months, our great leader Chairman Mao, amidst his busy schedule, received nearly 10 million Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country. In the past and present, which country, which revolutionary leader could do this? Only in our great country, our great leader Chairman Mao is forever heart-to-heart with the people.

At this moment, throughout Beijing, in tens of thousands of government offices, schools, and some workers' dormitories, beside the 2.5 million revolutionary students and Red Guards who came to Beijing to receive Chairman Mao's eighth inspection, millions of PLA officers and soldiers, just like Deng Yuejin and Yang Shuxing, were filled with excitement and shared the same belief. They felt that loving the Red Guards was an expression of their limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao, and hosting the Red Guards well was a powerful support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Passing on Mao Zedong Thought to the Younger Generation

"Why are the PLA soldiers so tireless? Why do the PLA soldiers care so much about people? Why are the PLA soldiers so patient with people? Why is the PLA's discipline and organization so strong?" During their time with the PLA, many Red Guards found the answers. This is because the PLA never leaves Chairman Mao's books, never leaves Chairman Mao's words, never leaves Mao Zedong Thought, and never leaves Chairman Mao's teachings in their actions.

The day to receive the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao was approaching. The 2.5 million revolutionary young people must all carry Mao Zedong Thought to receive Chairman Mao's inspection. The PLA and the Red Guards together studied the "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" repeatedly. To make the Red Guards' discipline strong, their thoughts must be strong. The PLA kindly made the Red Guards understand that the "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," personally formulated by Chairman Mao, represent the interests of the people and are the PLA's treasures.

These words deeply moved the Red Guards. The young warriors made up their minds: "We must show the power of the Red Guards with our high discipline and organization, making the great leader satisfied, making the people of the whole country satisfied, and making the people of the whole world satisfied!"

The Red Guards listened to Chairman Mao's words the most. Mao Zedong Thought unified the Red Guards' thoughts and steps. When they marched past Tiananmen, they thought: if only they could stop for a second more, look for a moment more! But, "all actions follow orders," Chairman Mao's words echoed in their ears, and they did not stop for a moment! When they sat on the sides of Tiananmen to receive Chairman Mao's inspection, they wanted to stand up to see their beloved Chairman Mao more clearly! But, they did not stand up from their seats. They wanted the beloved Chairman Mao to see their little Red Guards, a team with high discipline and organization like the PLA.

In the reception station of the Central Academy of Fine Arts Affiliated Middle School, some Red Guards and revolutionary students from the south had thinner clothes. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao warmly cared for the revolutionary young people and sent them new sets of cotton and quilted clothes. However, there were more people than clothes, and it was not possible for everyone to have one.

The PLA comrades knew about this. They said: "Material things can be a little less, but spiritual things must not be lacking. We not only give clothes but also let every Red Guard and revolutionary student receive an education in Mao Zedong Thought."

A series of meaningful activities began.

PLA soldier Zhang Wenliang, seeing the new cotton coats and quilts sent by Chairman Mao, was moved to tears as he recounted the class oppression and exploitation of the old society. From the time he could remember, his family had never had a quilt. His mother, after giving birth to his little sister, wore ragged clothes and worked for the landlord in the ice and snow on the third day. Three of his younger brothers and sisters froze and starved to death. It was only after Chairman Mao liberated the disaster-stricken Inner Mongolia that his family ended their miserable days and began to live a happy life. Who made Zhang Wenliang's younger brothers and sisters freeze and starve to death? Who liberated Zhang Wenliang's family? The silent hall was filled with tears from many Red Guards. These were tears of anger and gratitude. The happiness of living in a new society and the boundless gratitude to Chairman Mao merged into a great warm current. They could not help but shout: "Never forget class bitterness, always remember blood debts!" "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" They carried strong class feelings and took up the "Three Articles," reading them over and over again.

"All revolutionary comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other." Mao Zedong Thought, like sunshine and dew, nourished the hearts of these revolutionary young people.

Now, distributing clothes presented a new problem: whoever was given clothes did not want them. Northern students gave them to southern students, and southern students gave them to ethnic minority students. Male students wanted to give them to female students, and female students pushed them to younger students. A female student, after repeatedly declining, cried. Many students who voluntarily did not take the cotton clothes said: "Chairman Mao's sunshine warmed our hearts, and we are warm even if we wear less." The distribution of cotton clothes turned into a living class on learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and a living class on class education.

The PLA had unlimited faith in Mao Zedong Thought. They elevated every matter to the height of Mao Zedong Thought to understand and solve it. The reception station was filled with the brilliant sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought.

"Living Lei Feng" Is Among Us

In the hearts of countless Red Guards, there was a lofty aspiration: to learn from Comrade Lei Feng, to take Comrade Lei Feng as an example, and to be reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Now, they were with the PLA, seeing countless living Lei Fengs with their own eyes. They said with hearts full of gratitude: "Chairman Mao cares the most about our growth and understands our feelings the best, sending living Lei Fengs to our side."

In the hearts of the Red Guards, the PLA left a deep, deep impression:

The incident happened by the moat outside Fuchengmen. That afternoon, the PLA was leading a team of Red Guards to train on the riverbank. Suddenly, there was a splash, and three children playing with a tricycle fell into the river, along with the tricycle. The PLA soldiers Zhang Guolai, Luo Wanyin, and Zhang Xiaoyan, wearing new cotton uniforms and serving as Red Guards' platoon leaders, did not hesitate and dove into the water. They rescued the three children and then went back into the water to retrieve the tricycle.

The northwest wind was howling, and the three PLA soldiers were soaked, their faces blue from the cold. When they heard the rescued children say that there was also a shovel on the tricycle that had fallen into the river, Zhang Guolai's mind immediately flashed with the words: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the people's interests." He did not hesitate and immediately jumped back into the water, retrieving the shovel that had sunk to the bottom.

The three rescued children returned safely to their homes. The three PLA soldiers, as if nothing had happened, continued to lead the Red Guards in training, still wearing their cold, wet cotton uniforms.

What is "selflessness and devotion to others"? What is a "pure person," a "noble person," a "person free from vulgar interests," and a "person beneficial to the people"? The Red Guards saw living examples.

In an eastern suburb reception station, PLA soldier Zhang Laibao became the Red Guards' platoon leader. In terms of age, he was about the same as the Red Guards. One night, something happened that deeply moved the Red Guards. That day, the weather was very cold, and Zhang Laibao was afraid the little brothers would catch a cold, so he quietly gave his quilt and coat to the Red Guards to cover themselves, leaving himself to lie on a straw mat in his clothes. The eldest aunt in the house saw that Zhang Laibao had nothing to cover himself with and immediately went to her room to get a coat to cover him. After a while, the aunt found that the coat had been moved to cover the Red Guards.

The next day, Zhang Laibao caught a cold. The aunt was deeply moved. She told the Red Guards who had just woken up: "You are not learning from Lei Feng? Living Lei Feng is among you, he is your platoon leader Zhang!"

At night, the Red Guards were asleep, and Zhang Laibao quietly read the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" leaning against the wall. In the morning, before the Red Guards had woken up, he had already swept the courtyard clean. Once, after returning from a revolutionary linking up, the students felt hungry. He enthusiastically gave them the dry rations he had bought. On the night before the great leader Chairman Mao received the Red Guards, a Red Guard from Hubei had an attack of arthritis. Zhang Laibao knew how anxious this comrade was. Zhang Laibao did his best to give the comrade a few cupping treatments. The next day, the comrade was able to walk again. He happily went with his companions to receive the inspection of the great leader and spent the happiest day of his life.

In the reception stations scattered throughout Beijing, there were countless soldiers like Zhang Laibao, who were ordinary yet great people like Lei Feng. They enthusiastically received Chairman Mao's guests from all over the country, spreading the great Mao Zedong Thought and the excellent traditions and styles of the PLA in action. Countless Red Guards would deeply remember the living Lei Fengs who had lived with them!

Learning the Good Traditions and Styles of the PLA

In every reception station, we could see such touching scenes: where the PLA soldiers with five-pointed red stars on their caps appeared, there would be dozens of lively faces surrounding them. These lovable Red Guards affectionately held the hands of the PLA soldiers, pulled their shoulders, asked them to explain the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shared their experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, asked them to tell stories of battles, and tell their personal histories...

How much our Red Guards loved the PLA!

Countless Red Guards learned from the PLA everywhere. In the reception station of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, in the corridors, dining halls, and dormitories, there were groups of Red Guards quietly taking the brooms from the hands of the PLA soldiers, learning from the PLA to do the dirtiest and hardest work. They did not care about the fatigue of a day of revolutionary linking up, and at night, they crowded around the PLA soldiers, studying Chairman Mao's works together to find answers to their questions. The PLA's every word and deed consciously followed Chairman Mao's teachings, using the "Three Articles" to break down selfishness and establish public spirit, which had a strong resonance in the hearts of the Red Guards.

The Red Guards of the Petroleum War School Long March Team walked over a thousand miles on foot to Beijing. When they passed by the Ta Mountain Hero Memorial, they had solemnly sworn in front of the martyrs' tomb: they would definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, face the wind and rain in class struggle, and no matter what setbacks they faced, they would not turn back. They planned to continue on foot to Yan'an after seeing the great leader in Beijing. At this time, they saw in the newspaper the news of Premier Zhou and other central leaders receiving various long march teams. Some people had the thought: we could also be on the newspaper, how glorious. But they saw the PLA comrades in the reception station, working diligently from morning to night, doing everything for them, and they couldn't even find out their names. When asked insistently, they said their surname was "Jie" and their name was "Jiefangjun," or their surname was "Qin" and their name was "Qinmuyuan." The Red Guards of the Petroleum War School understood a truth from these humble answers: the PLA had made Chairman Mao's instructions into conscious actions, and no one recorded their good deeds for themselves. Thus, they re-studied the "Three Articles," dug out the fleeting wrong thoughts from their hearts, and decided to re-arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, lead the long march with the spirit of the "Three Articles," and be nameless heroes in the long march, just like the PLA!

The great example of the PLA deeply infected every Red Guard. A little Red Guard from Shanghai, who was originally very naughty, seemed to have grown up after living with the PLA for a few days. He recalled his past: "Before, I always used my young age to excuse myself and was not willing to seriously correct my shortcomings. When I found a shortcoming, I always thought in my heart: forgive myself one more time, and I will correct it next time!" Now, he learned the good traditions and styles of the PLA, and whenever he encountered such a problem, he would tell himself: "Never forgive myself one more time!"

A student who had returned from Indonesia wore a cotton vest and a sweater, insisting on giving the cotton vest to a student from Guangzhou. He said: "Clothes worn by others warm the heart." At night, some students slept warmer and warmer because someone had added a coat to them without them knowing.

The PLA was like this, using their actual actions of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to promote the ideological revolution of the Red Guards. The excellent traditions and styles of the PLA were blooming and bearing fruit among countless Red Guards.

Now, the Red Guards from all over the country were bidding farewell to the capital with full enthusiasm. The train was about to depart. Many Red Guards still held the hands of the PLA soldiers, reluctant to part, and cried until they could not speak. Their hearts had deeply engraved the heroic image of the PLA. These ten days in their lives were only a short time, but they would illuminate their growth path. They would forever remember November 1966, forever remember the boundless expectations of the beloved Chairman Mao on Tiananmen, and forever remember the education they received in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought of the PLA. Their future battle path was still long, and the revolutionary burden on their shoulders was still heavy. They would still face many tests. But as long as they thought of their days in Beijing, their courage would double, and their steps would be firm. They would be like the PLA, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. They would spread the flames of the cultural revolution throughout the country and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. They would be like the PLA, always, everywhere, and in everything study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They would be like the PLA, be selfless and devoted to others, fight against selfishness, and establish public spirit. They would be like the PLA, have iron discipline. In short, they would be like the PLA, "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people.

    解放军战士和红卫兵小将
    十一月的北京，虽然进入初冬，但是全城热气腾腾，一片革命景象。来自全国二十八个省（区）市、几十个民族的二百五十万红卫兵和革命师生，齐集北京，接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。
          毛主席的战士热爱红卫兵
    初冬的夜晚，满天星斗。北京的灯火，比天上的星斗更灿烂辉煌。在这里，毛主席请来的客人——红卫兵已经幸福地入睡了。招待红卫兵的解放军干部和战士，十分忙碌。在每一个接待站里，他们在睡满红卫兵的房间里轻轻走动，给这一个蹬掉被子的红卫兵盖好被子，给那一个红卫兵缝补衣服和鞋袜。他们不少人已有两天两夜没有睡觉了，但是这时候谁也没有一丝睡意。他们心里充满了无比的幸福：来到毛主席的身边，招待毛主席请来的客人，真是恨不得长出十双手来为红卫兵服务。他们那里能睡得着呢？
    在西城区一个接待站里，二十三岁的解放军班长、现在担任红卫兵排长的邓跃进，借着走廊里的灯光学习“老三篇”。他严格地检查自己是不是按照毛主席的教导，像白求恩、张思德那样，做到了“完全”、“彻底”为红卫兵服务？他把这些红卫兵看成自己的亲弟弟、妹妹一样，生怕他们着凉，把自己的被子、褥子和棉大衣全给红卫兵盖上，自己只披了一件薄薄的雨衣。他看到一个红卫兵的身子动了一下，不由得心里也动了一下。是不是这个红卫兵身上还冷？是不是自己还没有做到“毫不利己专门利人”？邓跃进连忙把身上的雨衣盖到那个红卫兵身上。“只要你们身上暖和，我身上就暖和。”邓跃进心里对睡着的红卫兵说。
    邓跃进想起他第一次野营的夜晚。那时他刚入伍。队伍露宿在一个山头，天气非常冷。他的班长过来，把自己的大衣盖在他身上。他推辞不要。班长轻轻对他说：“只要你身上暖和，我身上就暖和。”班长这句话，不正是体现了毛主席教导我们的“毫不利己专门利人”吗？不正是说明了我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的这支人民军队的传统吗？班长这句话，一直留在他的心里。现在，他也像班长那样来带红卫兵了。他也要像班长那样，把毛主席的教导，把毛主席亲手缔造和培养的解放军的革命传统、革命作风一代代传下去，传给红卫兵！
    夜已经很深了。解放军某部师政治部主任杨述兴还没有睡。他关心着红卫兵的冷热，亲自到红卫兵住的每间房子去检查。他看到解放军同志一个个都和衣睡在门口，挡住门缝吹进的冷风，不让一丝冷风吹到红卫兵身上。他看到一个红卫兵光着上身要到门外解手，一个战士急忙把棉袄给他披上。他看到一个十三四岁的小红卫兵一边踢着被子，一边在睡梦中咕噜着：“我要见毛主席，我要见毛主席！”多么好的红小兵啊！杨述兴十分感动。他想：这么年轻，这样热爱毛主席！这么年轻，就到北京来进行革命串连，这样关心国家大事！在这年轻一代的身上，强烈地闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。他不禁想起了他的青年时代，和这些红卫兵一样的年龄，身体还没有三八步枪高就参加了八路军。和现在的红卫兵一样，他那一辈青年也是敢想敢干敢斗争。他曾经在冀中坚持游击战、地道战，同拿枪的敌人进行残酷的战斗。他的青年时代在战争中度过，他在毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队中锻炼成长。毛主席亲手培育了他们这一代。现在，在新的历史时期，革命小将以更高的革命自觉，在无产阶级文化大革命的严峻斗争中，同不拿枪的敌人进行尖锐的斗争。毛主席又在亲手培养着这革命的一代！毛主席希望他们带好这革命的青年一代。千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人正在阶级斗争的大风大浪中成长起来。
    杨述兴感情激动地想，在短短的三个月内，我们的伟大领袖毛主席在百忙之中，接见了来自全国各地的近千万红卫兵和革命师生。古往今来，世界上有哪一个国家，哪一个革命领袖能这样做？只有在我们伟大的国家，我们伟大的领袖毛主席永远和群众心连心。
    就在这时，在全北京城，在成千上万个机关、学校和一部分职工宿舍里，在来北京接受毛主席第八次检阅的二百五十万革命师生和红卫兵身边，千千万万个解放军干部和战士，都和邓跃进、杨述兴一样，怀着激动的心情，抱着同样的信念。他们觉得热爱红卫兵，就是对毛主席的无限忠诚，招待好红卫兵，就是对无产阶级文化大革命的有力支持。
        把毛泽东思想传给年青一代
    “为什么解放军那样不知道疲劳？为什么解放军那么关心人？为什么解放军对人那么耐心？为什么解放军组织性、纪律性那样强？”在和解放军相处的日子里，许许多多红卫兵找到了答案。这就是：解放军身不离毛主席的书，口不离毛主席的话，心不离毛泽东思想，行动不离毛主席的教导。
    接受伟大领袖毛主席检阅的日子快要来到了，要使二百五十万革命小将都带着毛泽东思想，去接受毛主席的检阅。解放军和红卫兵一起，认真地、反复地学习“三大纪律、八项注意”的语录。要使红卫兵的纪律过硬，必须思想过硬。解放军亲切地使红卫兵了解到毛主席亲手制订的“三大纪律、八项注意”，每一条、每一字都代表人民的利益，是解放军的传家宝。
    这些话深深打动了红卫兵。小将们下定决心：“要以自己的高度组织性、纪律性，来显示红卫兵的威力，使伟大的领袖看了满意，使全中国人民满意，使全世界人民满意！”
    红卫兵最听毛主席的话。毛泽东思想统一了红卫兵的思想和步伐。当他们列队走过天安门的时候，他们想：那怕是多停留一秒钟，多看上一眼也好啊！可是，“一切行动听指挥”，毛主席的话响在耳边，他们一刻也不多停留！当他们坐在天安门两旁的大街上接受毛主席检阅的时候，多么想站起来更清楚地看看敬爱的毛主席！可是，他们谁也不从自己的座位上站起来。他们要让敬爱的毛主席看看自己的红小兵，是一支像解放军那样有着高度组织性、纪律性的队伍。
    在中央美术学院附中接待站里，有些从南方来的红卫兵和革命师生的衣服比较单薄。党中央和毛主席热情关怀革命小将，送来了一套套崭新的棉衣和绒衣。人多衣服少，不可能每人一件。
    解放军同志知道了这件事。他们说：“物质的东西少一些不要紧，精神的东西万万不能少。我们不但要发衣服，更要让每个红卫兵和革命师生受到一次毛泽东思想的教育。”
    一系列富有教育意义的活动开始了。
    解放军战士张文亮，眼看着毛主席送来的一件件新棉衣，一条条新棉被，激动地控诉了旧社会的阶级压迫和剥削。从他记事起，全家没有盖过一条棉被。母亲生下小妹妹的第三天，就穿着破烂的单衣裤，在冰天雪地里给地主干活。三个弟弟、妹妹都冻死饿死了。毛主席解放了灾难深重的内蒙古以后，他们全家才结束了苦难的日子，过上了幸福的生活。是谁使张文亮同志的小弟弟、小妹妹冻死、饿死？是谁使张文亮同志的一家得到解放？肃静的会场上，不少红卫兵悄悄地擦抹眼泪。这是悲愤的眼泪，也是感激的眼泪。生活在新社会的幸福，对毛主席的无限感激，汇成一股巨大的暖流。他们禁不住高呼：“不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇！”“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”他们带着强烈的阶级感情，拿起“老三篇”，一遍又一遍地朗读起来。
      “一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”毛泽东思想像阳光，像雨露，滋润着这些革命小将的心。
    现在，发衣服又出现了一个新的难题：发给谁谁都不要。北方的同学让给南方同学，南方同学又让给少数民族的同学，男同学要给女同学，女同学又推给小同学。一位女同学再三推让不过，急得直掉眼泪。许多自动不领棉衣的同学说：“毛主席的阳光照暖了我们的心，我们身上穿得少些，我们的心里无比温暖。”发放棉衣的事，变成了一堂活学活用毛主席著作、一堂活生生的阶级教育课。
    解放军无限信仰毛泽东思想。他们把每一件事情，都提高到毛泽东思想的高度来认识，来解决。接待站充满了毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光。
          “活雷锋”就在我们身边
    在无数红卫兵的心里，早有一个崇高的志愿：要向雷锋同志学习，要以雷锋同志为榜样，做无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人。
    现在，他们和解放军在一起，亲眼看到了千千万万个活雷锋。他们怀着无比感激的心情说：“毛主席最关心我们青少年的成长，最了解我们红卫兵的心情，把活雷锋送到了我们的身边。”
    在红卫兵的心坎上，深深地、深深地刻下解放军这样光辉的形象：
    事情发生在阜成门外的护城河边。这天下午，解放军正带领一队队红卫兵，在河滩上操练。忽然“噗通”一声，三个推着三轮车玩耍的孩子，连人带车全部掉到河里。穿着崭新的棉军装、担任红卫兵排长的解放军战士张国来、罗万银、张小彦三人不顾一切，一头钻进水里。他们把三个孩子抱上河岸，又下水去抬出了三轮车。
    西北风在呼啸，三个解放军战士浑身湿淋淋的，脸冻得发青。当听到被救出的孩子们说，车上还有一把铁锹也掉在河里的时候，张国来头脑里立刻闪出几个金光闪闪的大字：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”他毫不犹豫，立即重新跳进水里，摸到了那把沉在水底的铁锹。
    三个被救出的孩子，平安地回到自己的家里。三个解放军战士，若无其事地穿着冰冷的湿棉衣，仍然坚持带领红卫兵操练。
    什么叫做“毫不利己专门利人”？什么叫做“纯粹的人”、“高尚的人”、
  “脱离了低级趣味的人”、
  “有益于人民的人”？红卫兵小将们看到了活生生的榜样。
    在东郊一个接待站里，解放军战士张来宝当了红卫兵的排长。论年龄，他和红卫兵小将差不多。一天夜晚，使红卫兵小将们深深感动的事情发生了。这天天气很冷，张来宝生怕小弟弟们受冻，悄悄把自己的棉被和大衣全给红卫兵盖上，自己和衣躺在草垫上。这家的老大娘看到张来宝什么也没有盖，马上到自己屋里拿了一件大衣盖在他身上。过了一会，老大娘发现那件大衣，又盖到红卫兵的身上去了。
    第二天，张来宝受凉感冒了。老大娘深受感动。她对刚起床的红卫兵说：“你们不是要向雷锋学习吗？活雷锋就在你们身边，他就是你们的张排长！”
    夜晚，红卫兵睡熟了，张来宝靠着墙角悄悄地读《毛主席语录》。早晨，红卫兵们还没有起床，他已经把住处的院子扫得干干净净。有次串连回来，同学们感到饿了。他把买好的干粮，热情地送到他们手里。在伟大领袖毛主席接见红卫兵的前夜，来自湖北的一个红卫兵的关节炎发作了。张来宝知道，这位同学的心里多么着急呵！张来宝想方设法，给这个同学拔了几次火罐。第二天，这位同学就能走动了。他欢欢喜喜地和同伴一道，接受了伟大领袖的检阅，度过了一生中最幸福的一天。
    在遍布北京城的红卫兵接待站里，有千千万万个张来宝这样的战士，他们都是雷锋式的平凡而又伟大的人。他们极端热忱地接待来自祖国各地的毛主席的客人，身体力行地传播伟大的毛泽东思想，传播解放军的优良传统和作风。千千万万红卫兵都将深深记住曾经和他们生活在一起的活雷锋！
        学习解放军的好传统好作风
    我们在每个接待站里，都可以看到这样动人的情景：戴着五角红星军帽的解放军出现在哪里，哪里就围拢着十几张、几十张生气勃勃的笑脸。这些可爱的红卫兵亲热地拉着解放军的手，扯着他们的肩膀，要他们讲解《毛主席语录》，介绍活学活用毛主席著作的体会，请他们讲战斗故事，讲个人的家史……
    我们的红卫兵多么热爱解放军啊！
    千千万万个红卫兵处处以解放军为榜样，处处学习着解放军。在石油工业部接待站里，走廊上，食堂里，宿舍里，都有一群群红卫兵悄悄从背后夺走解放军手里的扫帚，学着解放军的样子，抢着去干最脏最累的活儿。他们不顾一天外出串连的疲劳，晚上挤在解放军的身边，一起带着问题从毛主席的著作里寻求答案。解放军一言一行都自觉遵照毛主席的教导，用
  “老三篇”破私立公，在红卫兵心里引起了强烈的反响。
    锦州石油战校红卫兵长征队徒步走了一千多里，来到北京。当他们途经塔山英雄纪念碑的时候，曾在烈士墓前庄严宣誓：一定要听毛主席的话，在阶级斗争中经风雨，见世面，不管受到什么挫折，决不回头。他们准备到了北京，见了伟大的领袖，继续徒步向延安前进。这时候，他们在报上看到周总理和其他中央负责同志接见各路长征队的消息。有的人脑子里就闪过这样的念头：咱们也能上报多光彩。可是，他们看到接待站的解放军同志，从早到晚，勤勤恳恳，埋头苦干，把一切都替他们想到了，把一切都替他们做到了，就是打听不出他们的姓名。实在问得紧了，他们就说姓“解”，叫“解放军”，或者姓“勤”，叫“勤务员”。石油战校的红卫兵，从这些谦虚的回答中，懂得了一个真理：解放军把执行毛主席的指示变成了自觉的行动，谁也不把自己做的好事记在自己账上。于是，他们重新学习了“老三篇”，从思想深处去挖自己一闪而过的错误念头，决定重新用毛泽东思想武装自己，用“老三篇”的精神统帅长征，像解放军那样，做长征中的无名英雄！
    解放军伟大榜样的力量，深深地感染着每个红卫兵。上海来的一个小红卫兵，本来很调皮。但他和解放军一起生活了短短几天，好像一下子长大了。他回顾自己的过去说：“以前，总是拿年龄小原谅自己，不肯认真克服缺点。发现了什么缺点，心里老是想：再原谅自己一次吧，以后改就对了！”现在，他学了解放军的好传统、好作风，一遇到这样的问题，就对自己说：“决不再原谅自己一次！”
    一位从印度尼西亚回来的华侨同学，穿了一件棉背心和一件毛衣，硬把棉背心脱给广州来的同学。他说：“衣服穿在别人的身上，暖在自己的心里。”夜里，一些同学越睡越暖和，因为不知是谁，在自己身上添盖了一件大衣。
    解放军就是这样，用自己活学活用毛主席著作的实际行动，促进了红卫兵的思想革命化。解放军的优良传统和作风，正在无数红卫兵中间开花结果。

    现在，来自全国各地的红卫兵，正满怀激情地向首都告别。火车快要开动了。许多红卫兵还拉住解放军的手，恋恋不舍，哭得说不出话来。他们的心里已经深深地刻下了解放军的英雄形象。这十几天在他们一生中只是很短的时间，但将照亮他们成长的道路。他们永远都会记住一九六六年的十一月，他们永远都会记住天安门上敬爱的毛主席对他们的无限期望，他们永远都会记住在解放军这座伟大的毛泽东思想大学校中所受到的教育。他们今后战斗的道路还很长，肩上要挑的革命担子还很重，他们还要经受很多考验。但是，只要他们一想起在北京的日子，他们就会勇气倍增，步伐坚定。他们要像解放军那样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想。他们要把文化革命的烈火燃遍全国，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。他们要像解放军那样，时时、处处、事事活学活用毛主席著作。要像解放军那样，毫不利己专门利人，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字。要像解放军那样有铁的纪律。总之，要像解放军那样，“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务。

    接待站既是革命师生和红卫兵交流文化革命经验的场所，也是宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。这是北京部队某部接待站的宣传人员在研究绘制幻灯片。
