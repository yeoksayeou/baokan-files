Kenyan Chargé d'Affaires Odhiambo held a reception to celebrate the third anniversary of Kenyan independence.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman Yang Mingxuan of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Chairman Gao Chongmin of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Chairman Fu Zuoyi of the National Defense Council, President Yang Xiufeng of the Supreme People's Court, Vice Minister Qi Pengfei of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other relevant officials were invited to attend the reception.

Odhiambo and Chen Yi both spoke at the reception, expressing their wishes for the friendship between the peoples of Kenya and China to grow stronger.

In his speech, Odhiambo introduced the situation of Kenya's economic construction after independence and expressed his gratitude for China's economic aid to Kenya.

He also said that Kenya firmly believes that the United Nations should be reorganized to better reflect the current world situation. He stated that Kenya has always supported and will continue to support the restoration of the People's Republic of China's lawful seat in the United Nations.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the peoples of China and Kenya have always been sympathetic and supportive of each other in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. Today, both our peoples still face the tasks of opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism, safeguarding national sovereignty, and building our own countries. Our friendship and cooperation have a broad foundation. Maintaining and strengthening friendly relations between China and Kenya is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries and is also in the interests of Asian-African unity against imperialism and the defense of world peace.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that Kenya's people have always supported the just cause of the peoples of Asian and African countries, and we fully support this. The Chinese people have always believed that mutual support among the oppressed peoples of the world in their struggle against imperialism and for national liberation is very important and a powerful guarantee of victory. The Chinese people are determined to work with the people of Kenya and the people of Africa to make every effort to continue to make their own contributions.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Kenyan government has consistently advocated for the restoration of China's lawful rights in the United Nations, opposed the U.S. imperialists' plot to create "two Chinas," and this year at the United Nations General Assembly, again took a supportive stance for the Chinese people. For this, the Chinese government and the Chinese people express their heartfelt thanks to the Kenyan government and people.

Envoys from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.
