To make a revolution, one must first revolutionize one's own thoughts. One must examine whether there are any impure elements in one's thoughts that do not align with the revolution. If there are, they must be thoroughly eliminated immediately.

		×		×		×

Transforming one's thoughts is a revolution; it cannot be comfortable or easy. Only by constantly "rebelling" in one's mind can one overthrow the "self" and establish the "public."

		×		×		×

Transforming one's worldview is like laying the foundation for a house; it is a major revolutionary task. If one's worldview is not thoroughly transformed, it is like building a house on sand, which cannot withstand the winds and waves.

		×		×		×

A gun that is not frequently cleaned will rust, and a person who does not thoroughly transform their thoughts will fall behind.

		×		×		×

The battlefield of thoughts must be fought over inch by inch, and every bit of power must be seized. Let Mao Zedong Thought completely occupy it.

		×		×		×

What is capability? Equipping one's mind with Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest capability. What is the future? Struggling for the cause of communism to the end is the greatest future.

		×		×		×

If Mao Zedong Thought does not occupy a person's mind, bourgeois thoughts will. Therefore, one must always be vigilant and frequently engage in criticism and self-criticism to eliminate non-proletarian thoughts from one's mind and maintain its purity. Only in this way can one preserve the honorable title of a proletarian revolutionary fighter.

		×		×		×

Whether it is one thousand or ten thousand, grasping the "main switch" is the first step. One must use revolutionary screws to fix the "main switch" on the proletarian "public," so that Mao Zedong Thought can always shine brightly, illuminating one's path forward.

		×		×		×

The revolution of thought must be like a social revolution; it cannot be gentle and polite, modest and yielding. It must be confrontational, unyielding, and direct. One must fight offensively, not defensively. One must not only attack the outer fortresses but also the inner strongholds. One must not only fight peripheral battles but also decisive battles. In this way, every struggle brings progress, and every struggle brings victory.

专栏：学用警句

    干革命，要先从自己的思想革起，看看自己思想里有没有与革命不合的脏东西。如果有，就应该马上把它彻底清除掉。
                ×　　×　　×
    改造思想是革命，不能那么舒服，也不是那么容易。只有在头脑里不断进行“暴动”，才能把“私”字推翻，把“公”字立起来。
                  ×　　×　　×
    改造世界观，就像造房子打地基一样，是革命大计；世界观改造得不彻底，就像房子盖在沙滩上一样，经不起风吹浪打。
                  ×　　×　　×
    枪不经常擦就会生锈，人不狠狠改造思想就会落后。
                  ×　　×　　×
    思想阵地，要寸土必争，寸权必夺，让毛泽东思想完全占领。
                  ×　　×　　×
    什么是能力？用毛泽东思想武装了头脑就有最大的能力。什么是前途？为共产主义事业奋斗到底就是最大的前途。
                ×　　×　　×
    人的脑子里，毛泽东思想不去占领，资产阶级思想就会去占领。因此，必须随时随地提高革命警惕，经常开展批评与自我批评，才能把脑子里的非无产阶级思想清除掉，保持其纯洁。这样才能保持无产阶级革命战士的光荣称号。
                ×　　×　　×
    抓一千，抓一万，抓好“总开关”是第一环。要用革命的螺丝钉，把“总开关”固定在无产阶级的“公”字上，永远闪耀毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮自己前进的道路。
                ×　　×　　×
    思想革命，要像社会革命一样，不能那样文质彬彬，那样温良恭俭让，而要针锋相对，寸步不让，短兵相接，刺刀见红。不能打防御战，而要打进攻战。不仅要打子堡，更要打母堡。不仅要打外围战，而且要打攻坚战。这样，斗一次就有一次进步，斗一次就有一次胜利。
