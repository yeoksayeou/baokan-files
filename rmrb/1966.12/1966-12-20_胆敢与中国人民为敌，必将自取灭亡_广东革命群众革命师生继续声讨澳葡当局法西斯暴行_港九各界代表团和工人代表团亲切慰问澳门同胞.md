Those who dare to oppose the Chinese people will surely meet their doom. Revolutionary masses and students in Guangdong continue to condemn the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities in Macau. Delegations from various sectors and workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon warmly visit Macau compatriots.

	New China News Agency, Guangzhou, December 17th: The revolutionary masses and students in Guangdong Province continue to hold meetings and write to newspapers, angrily condemning the heinous crimes of the Portuguese imperialists in Macau who killed Macau compatriots. They sternly warn the Portuguese authorities in Macau that they must immediately and fully implement the four demands proposed in the statement by the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee's Foreign Affairs Office and all the just demands of the Macau compatriots without any exception.

	More than 800 revolutionary teachers and students of the Fifth Primary School in Meixian City held a meeting and a demonstration march. At the condemnation meeting, they warned the Portuguese authorities in Macau that the great Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. We do not put the vicious U.S. imperialists in our eyes. If you dare to oppose the Chinese people, you will surely meet your doom.

	Revolutionary cadres and masses from Huizhou County, Taiping Town in Dongguan County, Zhaoqing City, and the chemical industry department in Guangzhou City warmly praised the righteous struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Macau, which showed the heroic spirit of the great Chinese people. They unanimously declared that they would be the strong backing of the Macau compatriots. They warned the Portuguese authorities in Macau that they must immediately and fully implement all the just demands proposed by our side and the Macau compatriots without any exception, publicly admit their guilt, and through relevant channels return the seven Kuomintang spies who were taken by the Portuguese authorities in Macau when they intruded into our waters in June 1963, and hand them over to the Chinese government for handling. They will not allow any deception tactics to be played.

	At a condemnation meeting attended by more than 2,000 people on Datang Street in Guangzhou, Rong Fengping, the mother of Xiang Xiu Li, representing the residents of the street, strongly protested against the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities in Macau who massacred Macau compatriots. She said, we absolutely will not allow the Portuguese authorities in Macau to escape responsibility, blood debts must be repaid! We firmly support the just struggle of the Macau compatriots and all their just demands. The Portuguese authorities in Macau must fully accept them, immediately fulfill them, admit their guilt, and publicly acknowledge their mistakes.

	According to the New China News Agency in Hong Kong, the delegation from various sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon to visit Macau compatriots and the delegation of workers from various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon to visit Macau compatriots visited Macau on the 14th and 17th respectively to express their warm greetings to the Macau compatriots who bravely resisted the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities in Macau, and to learn from the Macau workers, peasants, and patriotic students who actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle. During their stay in Macau, the two delegations were warmly welcomed by the Macau compatriots.
