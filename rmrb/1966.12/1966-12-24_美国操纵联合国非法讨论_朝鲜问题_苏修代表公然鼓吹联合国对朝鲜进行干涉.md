The United States Manipulates the United Nations to Illegally Discuss the "Korean Issue"
The Soviet Revisionists' Representative Openly Advocates United Nations Intervention in Korea

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 23rd, under the manipulation of the United States, the 21st United Nations General Assembly once again illegally discussed the "Korean Issue" and on the 19th passed a resolution that openly supports the United States' aggression against Korea and interference in Korea's internal affairs.

As in previous years, when the Political Committee of the General Assembly began discussing this issue on December 12, the United States rallied Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, and 11 other countries to propose a blatantly interfering resolution that supports U.S. aggression. This resolution, ignoring the fact that the United Nations was a belligerent in the Korean War and that more than 50,000 U.S. and other puppet country troops are still occupying South Korea under the "United Nations" banner, absurdly demands that "genuine free elections" be held in accordance with relevant UN resolutions to achieve the "independence" and "unification" that U.S. imperialists need in Korea. It also demands that the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," a tool used by the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean people, continue to "intensify its efforts."

The resolution also created a "legal" basis for the long-term U.S. occupation of South Korea, claiming that the U.S. invasion of Korea was "completely for the maintenance of peace and security." It stated that U.S. troops would only withdraw when the South Korean puppet regime "requests" it, or when the conditions for a "lasting solution (to the Korean issue)" stipulated by the United States using the name of the United Nations have been met.

Despite the opposition of many countries, the U.S. representative activated the voting machine, and the resolution was passed in the Political Committee of the General Assembly and the United Nations General Assembly, adding a dirty page to the criminal history of the United Nations.

On this issue, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique followed a path of betrayal and surrender. The Soviet representative, in his speech, on the one hand, claimed that the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people without external interference; on the other hand, he talked about how the United Nations bears a great responsibility for resolving the Korean issue and should play an active role in "resolving the Korean issue."

They dared not expose and condemn the crimes of U.S. imperialism in invading and interfering in Korea. This shows that their "support" for the Korean people is false, and their attempt to bring the Korean issue into the track of Sino-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world is true.

### 美国操纵联合国非法讨论“朝鲜问题”  苏修代表公然鼓吹联合国对朝鲜进行干涉

    美国操纵联合国非法讨论“朝鲜问题”
    苏修代表公然鼓吹联合国对朝鲜进行干涉
    据新华社二十三日讯在美国操纵下，第二十一届联合国大会又一次非法地讨论了“朝鲜问题”，并且在十九日通过了一项公然支持美国侵略朝鲜、干涉朝鲜内政的提案。
    同往年一样，在联大政治委员会十二月十二日开始讨论这个问题时，美国就纠集了日本、泰国、菲律宾等十四个国家，提出了一项露骨地干涉朝鲜内政、支持美国侵略的提案。这项提案，不顾联合国是朝鲜战争中的交战一方、至今仍有五万多名美国和其他仆从国的军队打着“联合国”的旗号占领南朝鲜这一事实，荒谬地要求通过“按照联大有关的决议举行的真正自由的选举”，在朝鲜实现美帝国主义者所需要的那种“独立”和“统一”，并且要求美国专门用来干涉朝鲜人民内部事务的工具“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”继续“加紧它的努力”。
    决议还为美国军队长期侵占南朝鲜制造了一个“合法”的“根据”，说什么美军侵略朝鲜“完全是为了维护和平和安全”，只有在南朝鲜傀儡政权的“要求”下，或是在美国盗用联合国的名义所规定的“持久解决（朝鲜问题）的条件已经实现”的情况下，美国才撤走它的侵略军。
    不顾许多国家的反对，美国代表开动表决机器，先后在联大政委会及联合国大会通过了它一手炮制的这一可耻决议，从而在联合国的罪恶历史上增添了肮脏的一页。
    苏联修正主义领导集团在这个问题上，奉行叛卖投降路线。苏联代表在发言中，一方面声称朝鲜问题应由朝鲜人民在没有外来干涉的情况下自己去解决；同时却又大谈什么“联合国对解决朝鲜问题负有很大责任”，要联合国在“解决朝鲜问题”中“起积极作用”。
    他们根本不敢揭露和谴责美帝国主义侵略、干涉朝鲜的罪行。这说明，他们“支持”朝鲜人民是假，企图把朝鲜问题纳入苏美合作主宰世界的轨道是真。
