Chinese Red Guards:

In the history of the world, in the era of Chairman Mao, your rise is a very significant event. We are watching you.

We also believe in the great leader Chairman Mao, just as you do, because Chairman Mao has always been with us. He has always been with the oppressed people. Chairman Mao is a reliable helmsman. Mao Zedong Thought is our compass. Since we have been illuminated by the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, we assure you that no force in the world can stop our advance.

When imperialism, led by the United States, colludes with revisionism to extend its filthy claws towards us, we must rely on Mao Zedong Thought. Without Mao Zedong Thought, we would be at a loss. Now, we will act as they call us—rebels. We will forever be rebels. If following Mao Zedong Thought is to be a rebel, then we are determined to forever be rebels.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of Africa and the people of all countries in the world have always been reliable. Although imperialists and revisionists in various countries try to smear the Cultural Revolution, we are exhilarated. Just as Chairman Mao told us, if the enemy opposes us, that is good, that means we have drawn a clear line with the enemy.

Let the thoughts of our supreme commander, the great helmsman Chairman Mao, spread throughout the world. All monsters and demons will eventually reveal their true colors.

Let us further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Let us resolutely respond to the call of Comrade Lin Biao. When you see Chairman Mao again, please shout with thunderous voices, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

    我们也将永远当造反者中国的红卫兵朋友们：
    在世界历史上，在毛泽东时代，你们的兴起是一个非常重大的事件。我们在注视着你们。
    我们也和你们一样信仰伟大的领袖毛主席，因为毛主席是始终和我们在一起的。他始终和我们被压迫的人民在一起。毛主席是可靠的舵手。毛泽东思想是我们非洲人民的指南针。由于我们已经得到毛泽东思想光辉的照耀，我们向你们保证，世界上没有任何力量能阻止我们前进。
    当以美国为首的帝国主义勾结修正主义向我们伸出肮脏的魔爪时，我们就必须依靠毛泽东思想。如果没有毛泽东思想，我们就会不知所措。而现在我们将像他们称呼我们为造反者那样地采取行动，我们将永远做造反者。如果遵循毛泽东思想就是造反，那么，我们就决心永远造反下去。
    在这个史无前例的中国文化大革命的斗争中，我们非洲人民和全世界的各国人民始终是可以信赖的。尽管帝国主义者和各国的修正主义分子企图给文化大革命抹黑，但是我们却感到欢欣鼓舞。正像毛主席告诉我们的，如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。……
    让我们的最高统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的思想传播于全世界，一切牛鬼蛇神终将显露原形。
    让我们用毛泽东思想进一步武装自己。让我们坚决响应林彪同志的号召。当你们再见到毛主席的时候，请用雷鸣般的声音高呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
