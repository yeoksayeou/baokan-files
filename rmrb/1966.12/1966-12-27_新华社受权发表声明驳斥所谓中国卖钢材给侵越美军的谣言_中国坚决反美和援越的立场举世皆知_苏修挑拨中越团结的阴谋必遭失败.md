	Xinhua News Agency, authorized to issue a statement, strongly refutes the recent malicious rumors spread by Western news agencies and Soviet publications that "China sold thousands of tons of steel to the U.S. forces invading Vietnam." The full text of the statement is as follows:

	Recently, Western news agencies and Soviet publications have been relentlessly spreading the rumor that "China sold thousands of tons of steel to the U.S. forces invading Vietnam." In response, Xinhua News Agency is authorized to declare that this claim is obviously a malicious fabrication aimed at slandering. The clear stance of the Chinese people and government in firmly opposing U.S. imperialism and resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation is well-known worldwide. Anyone attempting to sow discord and disrupt the great combat unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples will meet with a shameful failure.

	Xinhua News Agency, December 26th. As the Johnson administration of the United States continues to dispatch aircraft to bomb Hanoi, committing heinous crimes that have been universally condemned by the people of the world, and as the conspiracy of U.S.-Soviet collusion to "bomb to force negotiations" is fully exposed, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique shamelessly fabricated and spread the rumor that China sold a large amount of steel to the U.S. forces invading Vietnam. They maliciously slander the seven hundred million Chinese people, who are the most resolute supporters of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, in an attempt to sow discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples and to cover up their despicable collusion with U.S. imperialism and betrayal of the interests of the Vietnamese people.

	The Soviet newspaper *Izvestia* on the 20th published an article from the British *Observer*, accusing the People's Republic of China of selling several thousand tons of steel to the United States for use in "constructing new air and military bases in South Vietnam necessary for the escalation of the war in Vietnam." It is worth noting that the *Observer* explained the origin of this rumor by stating that the news of China selling steel came right after *Izvestia* last month accused China of conducting large-scale transactions with the United States. This shows that the *Observer* is merely a small peddler in the spread of this rumor, while the true rumor-monger is the Soviet revisionist leader who directed *Izvestia* to publish this rumor.

	The Soviet revisionist leaders, who are at their wits' end, have stooped to the level of living by spreading rumors, fully exposing that these anti-China heroes have reached the point of desperation. Rumors cannot distort the well-known stance of the Chinese people in firmly opposing U.S. imperialism and resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have already declared to the world that they are willing to make the greatest national sacrifices to be the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people. The combat unity between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples, who are as close as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe, and intimately united, is unbreakable by anyone. The rumors fabricated and spread by the Soviet revisionist leaders can only further expose their treacherous faces of betraying the world's revolutionary people and further prove that they are the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

    新华社受权发表声明驳斥所谓中国卖钢材给侵越美军的谣言
    中国坚决反美和援越的立场举世皆知
    苏修挑拨中越团结的阴谋必遭失败
    新华社二十六日讯　新华社二十六日受权发表声明，严厉驳斥西方通讯社和苏联报刊最近拚命散布所谓“中国卖几千吨钢材给侵越美军”的无耻谣言。声明全文如下：
    最近西方通讯社和苏联报刊拚命散布所谓“中国卖几千吨钢材给侵越美军”。对此，新华社受权声明，这种说法明眼人一看就知道是别有用心的彻头彻尾的造谣诽谤。中国人民和中国政府坚决反对美帝国主义、坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的鲜明立场，是举世皆知的。任何人想要挑拨和破坏中越人民的伟大战斗团结，都将遭到可耻的失败。
    新华社二十六日讯　正当美国约翰逊政府连续派飞机轰炸河内的滔天罪行遭到全世界人民一致声讨，美苏勾结“以炸迫和”阴谋大暴露的时候，苏联修正主义领导集团竟无耻地制造和传播所谓中国出卖大量钢材给侵越美军的谣言，恶毒地污蔑最坚决支持越南抗美救国斗争的七亿中国人民，妄图挑拨中越人民的战斗团结，掩盖它和美帝国主义勾结、出卖越南人民利益的卑鄙勾当。
    苏联《消息报》二十日用转载英国《观察家报》文章的方式，污蔑中华人民共和国卖给了美国几千吨钢，供“在南越建造在越南进行战争升级所必需的新的空军和军事基地”之用。值得注意的是，英国《观察家报》在文章中交待这个谣言的来历时说，中国卖钢材的消息是紧接在《消息报》上月指责中国和美国“进行大规模交易”之后透露出来的。这说明，英国《观察家报》不过是贩卖这个谣言活动中的一个小商贩，真正的谣言制造者是指挥《消息报》转载这一谣言的苏联修正主义领导人。
    日暮途穷的苏联修正主义领导人，竟然堕落到完全靠造谣言过日子，充分说明了这些反华勇士已经到了黔驴技穷的地步。谣言丝毫歪曲不了举世皆知的中国人民坚决反对美帝国主义、坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的鲜明立场。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，早已向全世界宣布，不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾。中国人民和越南人民唇齿相依、安危与共、亲密无间的战斗团结，是任何人也破坏不了的。苏联修正主义领导人制造和散布的这些谣言，只能更进一步暴露出他们背叛世界革命人民的丑恶嘴脸，更进一步证明他们是美帝国主义的头号帮凶。
