New China News Agency, December 19th: The leadership of the People's Liberation Army Navy held a grand naming ceremony yesterday in a certain location in East China. According to the order of the Ministry of National Defense, the certain regiment of the Navy Air Force was awarded the glorious title of "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment."

The ceremony began with the majestic melody of "The East Is Red." The more than 2,000 attendees recited Chairman Mao's quotes in unison: "The People's Liberation Army will forever be a fighting force. Even after national victory, during the historical period when classes have not been eliminated domestically and imperialist systems exist internationally, our army will still be a fighting force. There must be no misunderstanding or wavering on this point." The entire ceremony was filled with the revolutionary sentiments of the officers and soldiers' boundless loyalty, love, faith, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao. They unanimously expressed their determination to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, to seriously and diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to accelerate the construction of ideological revolutionization.

At the meeting, the responsible comrade of the Jinan Military Region, Yang Dezhi, read the order from the Ministry of National Defense awarding the certain regiment of the Navy Air Force the glorious title of "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment" and presented the flag on behalf of the Ministry of National Defense. Yang Dezhi, along with the navy's responsible comrades Liu Daosheng and Guo Bingkun, and the responsible comrades of certain units of the navy, Lu Renchan, presented the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Selected Readings from Mao Zedong's Works," Chairman Mao's photographs, Chairman Mao's badges, and Chairman Mao's quote badges on behalf of the leadership of the military units to all comrades of the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment." The comrades of the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment" were extremely moved when they received this batch of revolutionary treasures and precious gifts. They raised their arms and shouted in unison: We will resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call and raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level!

Yang Dezhi, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Jinan Military Region Party Committee, and all officers and soldiers, extended warm congratulations to all comrades of the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment." He said, "The 'Sea and Air Eagles Regiment' has, in the fifteen years since its establishment, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, focused on the ideological revolutionization of personnel, and highly carried forward the spirit of patriotism and internationalism. In the battles to resist America and aid Korea and to defend the country's sea and air, they have always displayed an unyielding spirit and revolutionary heroism that overwhelms all enemies, dealing heavy blows to the enemy and achieving brilliant results. They are indeed faithful defenders of the cause of the people of our country and the world."

Yang Dezhi said, the current domestic and international situation is excellent. With the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the entire country and the entire army have enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to "raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level," launching a new wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and creating a new situation. More and more revolutionary people around the world love Mao Zedong Thought and study Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionary tide of opposing imperialism and modern revisionism is surging forward worldwide. However, there is still a counter-revolutionary current in the world. The U.S. imperialists are expanding their aggression in Vietnam and have recently crazily bombed Hanoi and the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam. The modern revisionists are also working hard to serve the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression. We must heighten our vigilance, strengthen our preparedness, and be ready at any time to participate in the struggle to aid Vietnam and resist America, and to smash the provocations of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices against our great motherland.

Navy responsible comrade Liu Daosheng said: All the achievements and victories of the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment" are the victories of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has enabled them to establish a thoroughly communist worldview of serving the Chinese people and the people of the world, and Mao Zedong Thought has cultivated in them the greatest courage and the highest wisdom. He hoped that the comrades of the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment" would remain humble and press on, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always putting politics in command, and achieving new and greater successes. He called on all comrades in the navy to resolutely implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and tighten the study of Chairman Mao's works, creating a new situation and achieving new levels of study. Currently, it is especially important to study the "Three Articles" well, to thoroughly criticize the "self" and to revolutionize the "I," so that the "public" deeply takes root in one's soul, truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought.

At the meeting, speeches and congratulations were also given by local party and government leaders and relevant military leaders. The meeting also read congratulatory telegrams and letters from the Jinan Military Region Party Committee, Shenyang Military Region, Beijing Military Region, and Air Force leadership.

Representing all comrades of the regiment, Commander Wang Haicheng expressed his determination to the Party and Chairman Mao. He said, we will, with the deepest class feelings and the strongest revolutionary will, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao. We will definitely study the "Three Articles" as our motto, carry out a thorough revolution in our souls, promote ideological revolutionization, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people and the people of the world. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must never relax their fighting will. Any thought of relaxing the fighting will or of underestimating the enemy is wrong." We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen our preparedness, and deepen our hatred for the enemy. We will resolutely support our country's declaration with actual actions and be ready to participate in the struggle to aid Vietnam and resist America.

The naming ceremony ended with loud slogans. (Accompanied by a picture)

Mao Zedong Thought is the source of strength for the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment" and the fundamental guarantee of victory. This is the officers and soldiers of the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment" studying Chairman Mao's quotes together during the "Daily Reading" time.

    海军领导机关隆重举行“海空雄鹰团”命名大会
    表彰高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的英雄集体
    “海空雄鹰团”代表表示：一定要牢记毛主席的教导，百倍提高警惕，加强战备，做好参加援越抗美斗争的准备。
    新华社十九日讯　中国人民解放军海军领导机关昨天在华东某地隆重举行命名大会，根据国防部命令授予海军航空兵某团以“海空雄鹰团”的光荣称号。
    命名大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。到会的两千多人齐声朗读毛主席语录：“人民解放军永远是一个战斗队。就是在全国胜利以后，在国内没有消灭阶级和世界上存在着帝国主义制度的历史时期内，我们的军队还是一个战斗队。对于这一点不能有任何的误解和动摇。”大会自始至终充满着指战员们对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚，无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜的革命感情。他们一致表示，坚决响应林彪副主席的号召，要更加认真地刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，加速思想革命化建设。
    会上，人民解放军济南部队负责人杨得志，代表国防部宣读授予海军航空兵某团以“海空雄鹰团”光荣称号的命令，并且代表国防部向“海空雄鹰团”授旗。杨得志和海军负责人刘道生、郭炳坤以及海军某部负责人卢仁灿等代表部队领导机关向“海空雄鹰团”全体同志赠送《毛泽东选集》、《毛泽东著作选读》、毛主席照片、毛主席像章以及毛主席语录章。“海空雄鹰团”的同志们，接到这批革命的宝书和珍贵的礼品时，心情异常激动，大家振臂高呼：坚决响应林副主席的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段！
    杨得志代表中共中央华东局、济南部队党委及全体指战员，向“海空雄鹰团”全体同志致以热烈祝贺。他说，“海空雄鹰团”在组建后的十五年中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓人的思想革命化，高度发扬了爱国主义和国际主义的精神，在抗美援朝和保卫祖国海空的历次战斗中，都以一往无前的精神，和压倒一切敌人的革命英雄主义气概，给了敌人沉重的打击，取得了光辉战绩。他们不愧为祖国人民和世界人民事业的忠实保卫者。
    杨得志说，当前国内外是一片大好形势。随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，全国全军热烈响应林副主席“把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段”的伟大号召，掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的新热潮，出现了新局面。全世界越来越多的革命人民热爱毛泽东思想，学习毛主席著作。世界范围的反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的革命浪潮正在推向前进。但是，世界上还有一股反革命逆流存在。美帝国主义正在扩大侵略越南的战争，最近竟疯狂轰炸河内以及中国驻越南大使馆，现代修正主义者也加紧为美帝国主义的侵略政策效劳。我们要提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备参加援越抗美的斗争，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶对我们伟大祖国的挑衅。
    海军负责人刘道生说：“海空雄鹰团”所取得的一切成就和胜利，都是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。毛泽东思想使他们树立了完全彻底地为中国人民和世界人民服务的共产主义世界观，毛泽东思想培养了他们最大的勇敢和高度的智慧。他希望“海空雄鹰团”的同志们戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远突出政治，做出新的更大的成绩。他号召海军全体同志要坚决贯彻林副主席的指示，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得更高，把毛主席著作的学习抓得更紧，造成新局面，学出新水平。当前尤其要学好“老三篇”，大造“私”字的反，大革“我”字的命，使“公”字在自己的灵魂深处深深扎根，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。
    在大会上讲话和祝贺的，还有当地党政负责人和军队有关方面的负责人。会上，还宣读了济南部队党委、沈阳部队、北京部队和空军领导机关等单位发来的贺电和贺信。
      “海空雄鹰团”团长王海成代表全团同志在大会上向党和毛主席表示决心。他说，我们决心以最深厚的阶级感情，最坚强的革命意志，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。我们一定把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，在灵魂深处大闹革命，搞好思想革命化，全心全意地为中国人民和世界人民服务。毛主席教导我们：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”我们一定牢记毛主席的教导，百倍提高警惕，加强战备，把对敌人的仇恨搞得深深的。我们坚决以实际行动拥护我国政府的声明，做好参加援越抗美斗争的准备。
    命名大会在响亮的口号声中结束。（附图片）
    毛泽东思想是“海空雄鹰团”力量的源泉，是打胜仗的根本保证。这是“海空雄鹰团”的指战员在“天天读”的时间里集体学习毛主席语录。
