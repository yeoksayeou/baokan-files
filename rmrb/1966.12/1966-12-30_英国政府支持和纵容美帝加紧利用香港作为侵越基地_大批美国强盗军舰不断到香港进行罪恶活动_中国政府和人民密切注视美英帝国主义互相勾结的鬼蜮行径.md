Just as U.S. imperialism is madly bombing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, escalating its war of aggression against Vietnam, and brazenly bombing the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, the U.S. Seventh Fleet aircraft carrier "Coral Sea" and the destroyers "Parker," "Wallingford," "Uhlmann," "J.D. Craig," "N.J. Perry," and the amphibious assault ship "DeFiance Point," among other U.S. aggressor ships, have recently openly sailed to Hong Kong for activities.

On December 25, the number of U.S. aggression ships gathered off the coast of Hong Kong reached as many as ten. By noon on the 28th, there were still five U.S. ships docked in Hong Kong.

Throughout this year, with the support and connivance of the British government, U.S. imperialism has increasingly used Hong Kong as a base for its aggression against Vietnam.

By mid-December this year, the number of U.S. ships that had sailed to Hong Kong had reached 390, compared to 340 for the entire year of 1965.

In January of this year, after the U.S. resumed bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it sent its nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" to Hong Kong. U.S. Third Fleet Commander Admiral Miller openly threatened nuclear war against China from Hong Kong.

Since July of this year, the U.S. has further expanded its bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. Large numbers of U.S. ships participating in the aggression against Vietnam, including the aircraft carriers "Constellation," "Ticonderoga," "Oriskany," "Kearsarge," and the nuclear submarine "Permit," have all sailed to Hong Kong in succession.

It is clear that the U.S.'s series of criminal activities in Hong Kong are not only closely linked to the situation on the Vietnam battlefield but are also closely coordinated with the U.S.'s policy of intensifying the "containment" of China.

The British Labour government has consistently followed the U.S. on the Vietnam issue. To curry favor with the U.S., Britain has provided Hong Kong as a military base for the U.S.'s war of aggression against Vietnam.

In this regard, the Chinese government has strongly protested to the British government in two notes, on September 1, 1965, and February 1, 1966. However, the British government has persistently evaded responsibility, not only failing to take measures to stop it but also conniving at U.S. imperialism's continued war preparations in Hong Kong.

The Chinese government and people have been closely watching every "escalation" by the U.S. on the Vietnam battlefield and its various criminal activities in Hong Kong with the support of the British government.

The Chinese people and compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau strongly condemn the collusion between U.S. and British imperialism, and express great indignation and firm opposition to the British Labour government's blindly following the U.S. and turning Hong Kong into a U.S. military base. If the British government continues with this foolish act of playing with fire, it will surely reap the consequences.

    英国政府支持和纵容美帝加紧利用香港作为侵越基地
    大批美国强盗军舰不断到香港进行罪恶活动
    中国政府和人民密切注视美英帝国主义互相勾结的鬼蜮行径
    新华社二十九日讯正当美帝国主义疯狂轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内，在侵越战争中进行新的严重“升级”并且悍然轰炸中国驻越南大使馆的时候，参与这些罪恶活动的美国第七舰队航空母舰“珊瑚海”号和驱逐舰“帕金斯”号、“沃林顿”号、“乌尔曼”号、“杰·德·克雷格”号、“恩·杰·佩里”号和两栖登陆舰“迪法恩斯岬”号等美国强盗军舰，最近又公然开到香港进行活动。
    十二月二十五日，集结在香港海面的美国侵略军舰只竟达到十艘之多。截至二十八日中午，停泊在香港的美舰还有五艘。
    今年以来，在英国政府的支持和纵容下，美帝国主义变本加厉地利用香港作为它进行侵略越南战争的活动基地。
    截至十二月中旬，今年开到香港的美国军舰已达三百九十艘次，而一九六五年全年则为三百四十艘次。
    今年一月，美国悍然恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸后，曾把它的核动力航空母舰“企业”号开到香港。美国第三航空母舰舰队司令米勒海军少将还公然在香港向我国发出进行核战争的叫嚣。
    今年七月以来，美国进一步扩大轰炸河内、海防，大批参加侵越战争的美国舰只，包括航空母舰“星座”号、“提康德罗加”号、“勇猛”号、“奥里斯坎尼”号、“歧沙治”号和核潜艇“军曹鱼”号等，都曾先后开到香港。
    由此可见，美国在香港的这一系列罪恶活动，不仅同越南战场的形势发展密切相连，而且是同美国加紧“遏制”中国的战争政策紧密相配合的。
    英国工党政府在越南问题上一贯追随美国。为了讨好美国，英国把香港提供给美国作为侵越战争的军事活动基地。
    对此，中国政府曾在一九六五年九月一日和一九六六年二月一日的两次照会中，对英国政府一再提出强烈抗议。但是，英国政府一味狡辩抵赖，不但不采取措施制止，反而纵容美帝国主义继续在香港进行侵略战争的战备活动。
    中国政府和中国人民一直密切注视着美国在越南战场上的每一次“升级”和它在英国政府支持下利用香港进行的种种罪恶活动。
    中国人民和港澳各界同胞强烈谴责英美帝国主义互相勾结的鬼蜮行径，对于英国工党政府死心塌地追随美国，使香港成为美国军事活动基地的做法，表示极大愤慨和坚决反对。英国政府如果继续坚持这种玩火自焚的愚蠢行动，它必将自食其恶果。
