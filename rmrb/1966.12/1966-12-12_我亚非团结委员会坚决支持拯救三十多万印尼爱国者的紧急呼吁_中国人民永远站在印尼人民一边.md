The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity today issued a statement resolutely supporting the just stance of the recent urgent appeal by the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization of Indonesia regarding the rescue of over 300,000 Indonesian patriots. It strongly condemns the brutal massacre of Indonesian patriots by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, which is backed by U.S. imperialism, and exposes the traitorous nature of the Soviet revisionists who are acting as accomplices. The Indonesian people will surely repay their enemies in kind and with blood, and through their resolute struggle, they will ultimately achieve victory with the support of the revolutionary people of the world.

	New China News Agency, December 11th: The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity today issued a statement, resolutely supporting the just position of the recent urgent appeal by the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization of Indonesia regarding the rescue of over 300,000 Indonesian patriots. It angrily condemns the brutal massacre of Indonesian democratic progressives, communists, and patriots from all walks of life by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, which is backed by U.S. imperialism.

	The statement says that the right-wing military clique led by Suharto and Nasution, with the encouragement and support of U.S. imperialism, has launched a frenzied persecution campaign against Indonesia's democratic progressives, communists, and patriots from all walks of life. Over the past year, tens of thousands of outstanding Indonesian youth have been brutally slaughtered. Currently, over 300,000 patriots are still imprisoned, suffering inhuman torture and abuse. The bloody white terror still hangs over Indonesia. This bloody crime starkly exposes the extremely reactionary and brutal nature of the Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique, which has betrayed Indonesia's people and aligned itself with U.S. imperialism.

	The statement says that when Indonesian patriots and revolutionary people were brutally persecuted and slaughtered by the Suharto-Nasution fascist clique, the Soviet revisionist leadership actually provided the Suharto-Nasution clique with large quantities of military equipment, openly helping the Indonesian reactionary forces to slaughter revolutionary people. Countless facts show that wherever there is imperialist aggression and reactionary massacres of revolutionary people, the Soviet revisionists appear as accomplices. This once again clearly shows that the Soviet revisionist clique is a great traitor to the revolutionary cause of the Indonesian people and the people of the world.

	The statement points out that the revolutionary Indonesian people are not to be intimidated or exterminated. Ultimately, the persecution of revolutionary people can only promote broader and more intense revolutionary struggles among the people. Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. All reactionaries are merely paper tigers. The people have the power to defeat them. The more they kill, the more they will be defeated. This is an irresistible law." The Suharto-Nasution clique will surely "lift the stone only to drop it on their own feet." The great Indonesian people will surely repay their enemies in kind and with blood, and through their own resolute struggle, with the support of the revolutionary people of the world, they will ultimately achieve victory.

	The statement concludes that the Chinese people, who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support the Indonesian patriots in their struggle against the brutal persecution and slaughter by the Suharto-Nasution fascist clique. They resolutely support the Indonesian people in their struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and their own reactionary forces, and in their sacred cause of striving for the independence, freedom, democracy, and liberation of their country. The Chinese people will forever stand by the Indonesian people and fight to the end to support the just struggle of the Indonesian people.

    我亚非团结委员会坚决支持拯救三十多万印尼爱国者的紧急呼吁
    中国人民永远站在印尼人民一边
    谴责印尼反动派屠杀爱国者的血腥罪行，揭露苏修充当帮凶的叛徒面目  印尼人民一定会以牙还牙以血还血地对付敌人，坚决斗争取得最后胜利
    新华社十一日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天发表声明，坚决支持印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织最近发表的关于拯救三十多万印度尼西亚爱国者紧急呼吁书的正义立场，愤怒谴责在美帝国主义支持下的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军政权大规模野蛮屠杀印度尼西亚爱国人士的血腥罪行。
    声明说，以苏哈托和纳苏蒂安为首的印度尼西亚右派军人集团，在美帝国主义的纵容和支持下，向印度尼西亚的民主进步人士、共产党人和各阶层爱国人士发动了一场疯狂的迫害运动。一年多以来，几十万印度尼西亚优秀儿女惨遭杀害。目前仍有三十多万爱国者被监禁，遭受着惨无人道的虐待和折磨。血雨腥风的白色恐怖仍笼罩着印度尼西亚。这种血腥罪行赤裸裸地暴露了苏—纳右派军人集团投靠美帝国主义、与印度尼西亚人民为敌的极端反动和残暴的面目。
    声明说，苏联修正主义领导集团在印度尼西亚爱国志士和革命人民遭到苏—纳法西斯集团残暴迫害和屠杀的时候，竟然为苏—纳集团提供大量军事装备，明目张胆地帮助印尼反动势力屠杀革命人民。无数事实告诉人们，那里有帝国主义侵略、那里有反动派屠杀革命人民，苏联修正主义者帮凶的角色就在那里出现。这又一次清楚地告诉人们，苏修集团是印度尼西亚人民和世界人民革命事业的大叛徒。
    声明指出，革命的印度尼西亚人民是吓不倒、杀不绝的。对于革命人民的迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民更广泛更剧烈的革命。伟大领袖毛主席指出：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”苏—纳集团必将“搬起石头打自己的脚”。伟大的印度尼西亚人民一定会以牙还牙，以血还血地对付敌人，通过他们自己的坚决斗争，在世界革命人民的支援下，取得最后胜利。
    声明最后说，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国人民，坚决支持印度尼西亚爱国者反对苏—纳法西斯集团野蛮迫害和屠杀，坚决支持印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义和本国反动派，争取祖国独立、自由、民主和解放的神圣事业。中国人民将永远站在印度尼西亚人民一边，为支持印度尼西亚人民的正义斗争而奋斗到底。
