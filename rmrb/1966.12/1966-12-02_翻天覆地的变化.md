The story of "A Sewing Machine's Tale" reflects a scene from the Cultural Revolution where the "Four Olds" are destroyed and the "Four News" are established. This incident is but a small ripple in the surging tide of the great proletarian cultural revolution. From this small ripple, we can see the earth-shattering changes that have taken place in urban streets since the Cultural Revolution.

The reform of the Weidong Clothing Store is a product of the active cooperation between the Red Guards and revolutionary workers. Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the Red Guard youngsters have put forward many excellent proposals for destroying the old and establishing the new in society. These proposals are in line with the wishes of the broad revolutionary masses of workers. With great revolutionary enthusiasm, they have responded to and supported these proposals. Whatever can be immediately implemented, they have combined with specific circumstances to carry out and make them even more perfect.

The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards and revolutionary workers have formed a mighty current, powerfully washing away the remnants and dregs left over from the old society. Many capitalist poisons that could not be eliminated in the past have been washed away by this current today!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Youth is the most active and vital part of the entire social force. They are the most eager to learn and have the least conservative ideas, especially in the socialist era." Our young generation, our Red Guard fighters, have grown up under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong. They have keen political insight, and they have the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to pioneer. In this great proletarian cultural revolution, the Red Guards have become the vanguard. All revolutionary people should welcome the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards with both hands and join hands with the Red Guards to make a common revolution, sweeping away the "Four Olds" completely.

    翻天覆地的变化
    《一架缝纫机的故事》，反映了文化大革命中破“四旧”立“四新”的一个镜头。这件事情，只不过是汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命洪流中的一个小小的浪花，从这小小的浪花里，我们看到了文化大革命以来，城市街道的翻天覆地的变化。
    卫东服装店的革新，是红卫兵和革命职工积极合作的产物。在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，红卫兵小将们，对社会上破旧立新提出了许多很好的倡议。这些倡议，正符合广大革命职工的心意。他们以极大的革命热忱，响应和支持了这些倡议。凡是可以立即付诸实施的，他们都结合具体情况，加以实施，并且使它们更加完善。
    红卫兵和革命职工的革命行动，汇成一股巨流，有力地冲刷着旧社会遗留下来的残渣余孽。旧“蓝天”的许多资本主义余毒，十几年来未能清除的，今天被这股巨流冲掉了！
    毛主席教导我们：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。他们最肯学习，最少保守思想，在社会主义时代尤其是这样。”我们的青年一代，我们的红卫兵战士们，是在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的。他们有敏锐的政治眼光，他们有敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯的革命精神。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，红卫兵充当了急先锋。所有革命人民都应当举双手欢迎红卫兵的革命行动，都应当同红卫兵携起手来共同闹革命，把“四旧”扫除净尽。
