Nepali friends enthusiastically praise the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and warmly applaud the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

A Nepali engineer who recently visited China said: Chairman Mao is the great teacher, the great leader, the great helmsman, and the great commander. When he said this, he passionately recited a quote from Chairman Mao: "Resolve to fight to the end, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

This engineer said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has immense significance. China's prevention of revisionism is not only for the Chinese people but also for all the people of the world. He also talked about the joyful scenes of being with the Red Guards during his visit to China. He said: The Red Guards are very brave and very friendly to us. They took photos with us and taught us songs. We have already learned to sing "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea."

Another Nepali friend, during a get-together with the Red Guards, received a record of the song "The East Is Red" praising the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, from a young Red Guard. He treasures this gift very much and often invites his friends to learn this song of praise together. He said: Let us sing this song together and let the melody of "The East Is Red" resonate around the world.
