Macanese and Hong Kong compatriots from various sectors enthusiastically support the statement by the director of the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office and the four proposals put forward. They resolutely support the six demands and protest letter submitted by the Macanese representatives to the Portuguese authorities. They unanimously pointed out that the Portuguese authorities must fully accept these serious demands, implement them completely, without delay, and without haggling.

Yesterday afternoon, the *Macau Daily News* issued an extra edition, which was quickly sold out. The streets were filled with the inspiring news of the great support from the people of the socialist motherland for the anti-violence struggle of the Macanese. Many units held condemnation meetings.

A responsible person from the Macau Federation of Chinese Students said, "The statement of the Foreign Affairs Office has greatly boosted the morale of the Macanese. Due to the close unity of all Macanese and the resolute support of the great socialist motherland, our struggle will definitely achieve complete victory." Many workers and students severely condemned the long-term collusion of the Portuguese authorities with the Kuomintang bandits, endangering the Macanese. They angrily pointed out that the Kuomintang bandits, as lackeys and accomplices, played a role in the bloody massacre of our compatriots by Portuguese imperialism. The Portuguese authorities must immediately hand over the seven Kuomintang bandits who invaded our waters and were seized in 1963 to the Chinese government for handling.

Hong Kong compatriots from various sectors also expressed their views yesterday, stating that the statement of the Foreign Affairs Office is a solemn statement by our great socialist motherland condemning the fascist bloody massacre of the Portuguese authorities against the Macanese. It is the greatest support and encouragement for all Macanese who are steadfastly resisting the atrocities of the Portuguese authorities. Many workers held meetings yesterday to condemn the bloody crimes of the Portuguese authorities.

Macanese and Hong Kong compatriots from various sectors also pointed out unanimously: We will never let the fascist thugs in Macau get away with their bloody massacre of the streets of Macau. We must severely punish the main culprits, Schwellen and Fook-yee, and make the Portuguese authorities admit their guilt. However, the Portuguese authorities have not yet admitted their guilt truthfully and are still stubbornly playing tricks. We must join hands and stand shoulder to shoulder to carry on the struggle against the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities to the end.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 12th: Over 40,000 people from various sectors and Red Guards in Zhuhai County, Xinhui County, Jiangmen City, and Zhaoqing City in Guangdong Province held meetings and demonstrations on the 11th, angrily condemning the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese imperialists in Macau who brutally killed Macanese compatriots, and resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Macanese compatriots against oppression.

Party and government leaders from Foshan Prefecture, Zhaoqing Prefecture, Jiangmen City, and Zhaoqing City, as well as representatives of Red Guards, farmers, militiamen, and workers, were all filled with indignation and fury. They spoke at the condemnation meetings held in Jiangmen and Zhaoqing, warning the Portuguese authorities in unison: They must immediately accept and fully implement the four proposals made by the director of the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office on behalf of the government; they must immediately and unconditionally accept and fulfill all the just demands of the Macanese compatriots, severely punish the main culprits, apologize to the victims, and compensate for all losses; they must ensure that Kuomintang bandits do not carry out any sabotage activities in the future, and that American and British imperialists do not interfere in Macau affairs. Otherwise, they will reap what they sow.

Representatives at the condemnation meetings praised the Macanese patriots for their unyielding struggle against the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities, showing the fearless heroism of the Chinese nation in the era of Mao Zedong. They unanimously expressed their firm support and vowed to be the strong backbone of the Macanese compatriots in their struggle against oppression.

In Wanzi Commune, Zhuhai County, which is just across the water from Macau, a large number of militiamen and farmers held a condemnation meeting in the square facing Macau. Representatives of the militiamen and farmers pointed out at the condemnation meeting that the commune members living on the opposite bank of Macau had witnessed the Portuguese authorities' armed police opening fire and killing Macanese compatriots. The Portuguese authorities' attempt to evade their blood debt is absolutely impossible, and they must bear full responsibility for it.

Representatives of the Red Guards and revolutionary masses in Xinhui County solemnly pointed out at the condemnation meeting: The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. Blood debts must be repaid, and revenge must be taken. We firmly support the Macanese patriots in their struggle to the end. If the Portuguese authorities persist in their mistakes and dare to use the Kuomintang bandits and American and British imperialists to interfere in Macau affairs, the Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate it. Whoever provokes the great Chinese people will not have a good end.

After the meetings, a large number of Red Guards, workers, fishermen, commune members, and cadres from these regions, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao's quotations, and large banners strongly protesting the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities, angrily shouted slogans and held a grand demonstration.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 11th: News from Macau: Macanese compatriots who were illegally arrested by the Portuguese authorities were brutally tortured and beaten by the Portuguese fascist thugs in prison. Macanese compatriots strongly demand that the Portuguese authorities immediately release all the arrested compatriots.

Under the resolute support of the great socialist motherland, and under the angry condemnation of the Macanese and Hong Kong compatriots, the Portuguese authorities attempted to cover up the truth and released a total of 15 illegally arrested compatriots on the 8th and 11th. These victims, after being released from prison, immediately angrily exposed the crimes of the Portuguese fascist thugs who beat and tortured them.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, December 11th: Witnesses to the fascist bloody atrocities of the Portuguese authorities, and the brave rescuers of the injured Macanese compatriots, the 300-plus medical and staff members of Macau Jianhu Hospital, held a condemnation meeting on the afternoon of the 8th. On the 11th, all the doctors published an article in the *Macau Daily News*, exposing the heinous crimes of the Portuguese authorities.

    港九各界同胞昨天也纷纷发表谈话表示：外事处的声明是我们伟大社会主义祖国谴责澳葡当局对澳门同胞进行法西斯血腥大屠杀的严正声明，是对正在坚持反抗澳葡当局暴行斗争的全澳同胞的最大支持和极大的鼓舞。许多职工昨天分别举行了集会，声讨澳葡当局的血腥罪行。

    佛山专区、肇庆专区、江门市、肇庆市的党政负责人和红卫兵、农民、民兵、工人的代表们，个个气愤填膺，怒不可遏，他们在江门、肇庆两市分别举行的声讨大会上发表讲话，一致严正警告澳葡当局：必须立即接受并完全实现广东省人民委员会外事处长奉命提出的四项主张；必须立即无条件接受和履行澳门同胞所提出的一切正义要求，严惩主要肇事者，向受害者赔礼道歉和赔偿一切损失；必须切实保证今后不让蒋匪特务进行任何破坏活动，不让美英帝国主义插手澳门事务。否则，你们必将自食恶果。
    代表们在声讨大会上的发言中，热烈赞扬澳门爱国同胞同澳葡当局的法西斯暴行进行了不屈不挠的斗争，表现了毛泽东时代中华民族的大无畏的英雄气概。对此，他们一致表示最坚决的支持，誓做澳门同胞反迫害的坚强后盾。
    与澳门只一水之隔的珠海县湾仔公社，广大民兵和农民在面对澳门的广场上举行声讨大会。民兵和农民的代表们在声讨会上指出，湾仔公社社员住在澳门对岸，曾经耳闻目睹澳葡当局武装军警开枪屠杀澳门同胞，澳葡当局企图抵赖掉他们欠下的血债，是万万办不到的，他们必须对此承担全部罪责。
    新会县广大红卫兵和革命群众的代表在声讨大会上严正地指出：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好欺负的。血债一定要偿还，仇一定要报，我们坚决支持澳门爱国同胞斗争到底。如果澳葡当局执迷不悟，胆敢再利用蒋介石匪帮和美英帝国主义来干预澳门事务，中国人民是绝对不能容忍的。谁向伟大的中国人民挑衅，谁就决不会有什么好下场。
    这些地区在集会后，广大红卫兵、工人、渔民、公社社员和机关干部，高举毛主席画像、毛主席语录牌和最强烈抗议澳葡当局法西斯暴行等巨幅标语，愤怒地高呼口号，举行了声势浩大的示威游行。

    在强大的社会主义祖国坚决的支持下，在澳门和港九同胞愤怒的声讨下，澳葡当局企图敷衍塞责，于八日和十一日两次共释放了十五名被无理逮捕的同胞。这些受害者出狱之后，立即愤怒地控诉了澳葡法西斯暴徒毒打和虐待他们的罪行。
