The brilliance of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" has illuminated the Taishan Production Brigade of Hongshi People's Commune in Hengyang County, Hunan Province. Since 1964, this brigade has been deeply studying Chairman Mao's works, with the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as the main content, repeatedly studying and applying them. Over the past two years, the spiritual face of the commune members has been completely renewed. The elderly strive to be living "Yugongs," the youth strive to be living "Leifengs." The political atmosphere is thick, and good people and good deeds continuously emerge. Over the past two years, the commune members, with the spirit of Yugong moving mountains, have changed heaven and earth, making eighty percent of the farmland achieve irrigation, transforming barren hills into a new scene. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries have all developed vigorously.

Comrade Lin Biao's call to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage has greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the brigade's commune members and cadres to study. They have made a comprehensive summary, discussion, and sharing of their gains from studying and applying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" over the past two years. At the sharing meetings, more than 130 people have talked about their study experiences. Their feelings can be summed up in one sentence: The power of heaven and earth is nothing compared to the might of Mao Zedong Thought; the "Three Constantly Read Articles" have boundless power, are ever-new, and the more you study, the closer you feel.

    “老三篇”常学常新越学越亲
      “老三篇”的光辉，照红了湖南省衡阳县洪市公社太山大队。这个大队，从一九六四年开始大学毛主席著作，以“老三篇”为主要内容，反复学、反复用。两年来，社员们的精神面貌焕然一新。老年人争当活“愚公”，青年人争做活雷锋，政治空气很浓，好人好事不断涌现。两年间，社员们以愚公移山的精神改天换地，使百分之八十的农田实现了自流灌溉，使荒山秃岭变了样。农林牧副渔都有了蓬勃的发展。
    林彪同志关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的号召，极大地鼓舞了这个大队社员干部的学习积极性。他们对两年来反复学用“老三篇”的收获，进行了大总结、大讨论、大讲用。在讲用会上，先后有一百三十多人畅谈了自己的学习心得。他们的体会千条万条，归纳起来，就是一条：天大地大，比不上毛泽东思想的威力大；“老三篇”威力无穷，常学常新，越学越亲。
