The Indian government, which follows the United States, relies on U.S. "aid" grain to get by, and its days are getting harder and harder.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from New Delhi: Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi announced on November 26 that the U.S. government recently informed the Indian government that the U.S. is facing difficulties in supplying the 200 million tons of grain that India requested in August this year. The Indian government is considering reducing the domestic ration to cope with the food shortage. She urged the Indian people to prepare to tighten their belts even more.
