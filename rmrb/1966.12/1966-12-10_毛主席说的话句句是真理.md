Chairman Mao's words are all truth. Marxism-Leninism was established by Marx and Engels, developed by Lenin and Stalin, and brought to a new stage by Mao Zedong.

Comrade Mao Zedong's words are all truth, they are spiritual atomic bombs. For the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the whole world, studying Mao Zedong Thought is of the utmost importance. For me, studying Mao Zedong Thought is a duty, and it is my greatest joy.

    毛主席说的话句句是真理
    马列主义是马克思、恩格斯所确立的，列宁、斯大林把它发展的，毛泽东把马列主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。
    毛泽东同志的话句句是真理，是精神的原子弹。学习毛泽东思想对亚、非、拉以及全世界人民来说也是最重要的事。对我说来，学习毛泽东思想是一项义务，也是我最大的愉快。
