The vast number of workers on China's fertilizer production front, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's great strategic line of preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people. During the socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have launched a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, leading to a profound change in the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of workers. This has, in turn, promoted a leap forward in fertilizer production. By the end of November, the state's fertilizer production plan for this year has been completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled. Fertilizer production has increased by 26 percent compared to last year. The quality of nitrogen fertilizer has remained stable, while the quality of phosphate fertilizer has steadily improved; the consumption norms for raw materials and fuel have generally decreased; production costs have significantly reduced; and a new type of high-efficiency nitrogen-phosphorus compound fertilizer has also been put into production this year.

Workers on the fertilizer front have pointed out that these achievements this year are the victories of the great Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest and the wisest. They dare to think, dare to do, and dare to make revolution. A workshop in the Dalian Chemical Factory, designed by foreigners, was constrained by over a hundred regulations that tied the workers' hands, keeping the workshop's production from increasing. The workers of this factory, implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic line of preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people, decided to carry out reforms and switch from negative pressure to positive pressure operation. At that time, some people said, "Positive pressure operation has never been heard of in the world. This isn't something to play around with." In this situation, the workers studied Chairman Mao's teachings and drew great strength from them. They finally broke through the foreign constraints, successfully experimented with positive pressure operation, and, without increasing equipment or investment, raised the production capacity by 26.8 percent.

The vast number of workers on the fertilizer production front, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "making discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress," have resolutely carried out the policy of big, medium, and small enterprises coexisting and walking on two legs. This has led to a many-fold increase in production for small nitrogen fertilizer enterprises across the country, as well as the creation of advanced production processes in technology.

    从毛主席著作中吸取巨大的力量
    我国化肥产量显著增长
    头十一个月产量比去年全年还多四分之一
    据新华社南京二十七日电　我国化肥工业战线广大职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真贯彻毛主席提出的备战、备荒、为人民的伟大战略方针，在社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命中，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动新高潮，促进广大职工的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，从而推动化肥工业生产飞跃发展。到十一月底止，今年国家化肥生产计划已经提前超额完成，化肥产量比去年全年增长百分之二十六。氮肥质量一直稳定，磷肥质量稳步提高；原料、燃料消耗定额普遍下降；生产成本显著降低；一种新型高效的氮磷复合肥料也在今年投入了生产。
    化肥战线广大职工指出，今年这些成绩的取得，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大职工，最勇敢，最聪明，他们敢想、敢干、敢革命。大连化工厂有一个工段，是外国设计的。外国专家用一百多条规定束缚职工的手脚，使这个工段的产量一直上不去。这个厂的职工贯彻执行毛主席提出的备战、备荒、为人民的伟大战略方针，决心进行改革，改负压为正压操作。当时有人说：“加压操作在世界上还没有听说过，这不是闹着玩的。”在这种情况下，职工们就学习毛主席的教导，从中汲取巨大的力量。终于打破了洋框框，试验成功正压操作，没有增加设备、投资，就使生产能力提高了百分之二十六点八。
    化肥工业战线广大职工，遵循毛主席关于“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，坚决贯彻大中小并举，两条腿走路的方针，使各地的小氮肥企业，不仅在产量上有成倍的增长，而且在技术上也创造出了先进的生产流程。
