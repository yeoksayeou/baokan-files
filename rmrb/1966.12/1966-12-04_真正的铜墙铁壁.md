Chairman Mao said: "What is the true iron wall? It is the people, the millions and tens of millions of people who genuinely support the revolution."

To have unlimited trust in the people and to firmly rely on the people is Chairman Mao's consistent thought, the glorious tradition of our army, the foundation of the principles of revolutionary warfare strategy and tactics, and the code that every revolutionary soldier must follow. The people are the true heroes, the main actors on the stage of revolutionary warfare. The commanders of our revolutionary army are merely representatives of the countless commanders of the people. They must not stand above the people, act like aristocratic commanders, be self-satisfied, and fight "gentlemen's wars." We must, as ordinary soldiers, go deep into the people, humbly learn from the people, and draw courage and wisdom to defeat the enemy from the people. We must go to the most difficult and fiercest battlefields, share life and death with the people, and share the same fate. Only in this way can we achieve correct command.

In February 1945, a certain regiment of the Eighth Route Army was ordered to eliminate a key stronghold of the Japanese invaders in the heart of Shanxi Province, in the town of Mafen. This stronghold was on a hill to the east of the town. The Japanese had spent two years building it, using solid stone to construct walls five zhang high and more than two zhang thick. Each corner of the wall had a stone sentry post, and outside the wall was a circle of barbed wire, with only one gate for entry and exit. The stronghold housed a Japanese battalion equipped with steel cannons and machine guns, and had a radio station. Whenever there was a situation, reinforcements would arrive immediately. The Japanese used this stronghold to burn, kill, and loot in the surrounding counties of Xiyang, Shouyang, Yuxian, and Hexian within a day's journey. The local people hated them to the core and eagerly hoped to capture the Japanese stronghold. At that time, our equipment was very poor; we had no heavy artillery or explosives, and the only thing that could be considered a "heavy weapon" was a mortar. How could we, with such poor equipment, attack such a strong fortress? It was all thanks to the power of the people.

After receiving the mission, the regiment commander personally went to Mafen Town to gather intelligence on the enemy. The local people, upon hearing that the Eighth Route Army was going to attack the Japanese stronghold, flocked to report the atrocities of the Japanese and provided information about their activities. The Japanese were cunning; they did not allow a single Chinese person to live inside the stronghold. However, invaders on Chinese soil could not survive without Chinese people, so they still managed to get a Chinese liaison officer, but he could only live in a small house outside the stronghold. It was this lone Chinese person who could approach the Japanese who provided the army with important intelligence. With his and the people's help, the regiment commander and the officers who were to lead the assault team disguised themselves and entered the stronghold for further reconnaissance. In this way, relying on the people, we obtained all the information about the enemy's troop deployment and daily life. In contrast, due to the people's strict sealing of information, the Japanese were like blind and deaf, completely unaware of our activities.

Based on the instructions from higher authorities and the information gathered, the regiment commander and the people jointly formulated the battle plan. Given the situation at the time, it was obviously impossible to launch a frontal assault; we could only use a surprise attack. To successfully execute a surprise attack, we had to overcome several obstacles: First, how could the eighty-plus assault team members, under the watchful eyes of the Japanese sentries, stealthily cross more than twenty zhang of snow-covered ground and hide in the caves near the gate? Everyone suggested that the assault team should all wear thick cotton socks, allowing them to enter the hiding place without making a sound. Second, when should the attack be launched for maximum effectiveness? The people suggested choosing 6 AM, when the Japanese had opened the gate, and the sentries of the four sentry posts had been withdrawn, leaving only one sentry at the gate. All the Japanese were eating, completely unprepared, allowing us to catch them off guard. Everyone also suggested organizing a squad with large knives to silently eliminate the Japanese gate guards, thus not alerting the Japanese inside the stronghold. This battle plan, which concentrated the wisdom of the people, was perfectly executed during the battle.

The local people, to support our military operations, hurriedly made eighty-plus pairs of cotton socks and more than a dozen large knives overnight. The local militia and guerrilla forces were fully mobilized to intercept reinforcements and tie down nearby Japanese strongholds, actively cooperating with our actions. The people of Mafen Town organized themselves, standing guard at the village entrances and controlling the flow of people to prevent spies, seal off information, and ensure secrecy. After the battle began, the troops, according to the predetermined plan, rushed into the gate and, after fierce fighting, annihilated all the Japanese in the stronghold. Under the powerful containment of the local militia and guerrilla forces, the nearby strongholds' Japanese were preoccupied with their own problems and could not come to the rescue.

The battle of Mafen once again proved Chairman Mao's wise judgment: "What is the true iron wall? It is the people, the millions and tens of millions of people who genuinely support the revolution. This is the true iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries." Mobilized revolutionary masses are the true iron wall, the vast ocean that drowns the enemy, the fire formation that burns all "wild oxen," and the source of power for our revolutionary warfare. For decades, we have followed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, relying on the people and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, defeating powerful enemies both at home and abroad, and achieving one victory after another.

In the past, we relied on the people to fight wars, and in the future, we will rely even more on the people to fight wars. To do any revolutionary work, we must believe in the people and rely on the people to overcome all difficulties and advance victoriously on the revolutionary path. If we do not do this, we will see nothing, hear nothing, know nothing, be good for nothing, and accomplish nothing. We may even lose our way, lose confidence, forget the revolution, and fall into the abyss of opportunism.

Postscript

The articles published in this issue are the reflections of workers, peasants, and soldiers on studying Chairman Mao's quotations about the people being the creators of history.

The Shanghai Non-Ferrous Smelting Plant is a factory with very primitive equipment, but with workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, it can produce sulfuric zinc and copper powder. In Jiangsu's Yanjing County, Fangxiang Brigade, with peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought, it can turn a "wild duck pond" into a granary. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, a certain regiment, without heavy weapons, relied on the people to eliminate the Japanese stronghold. These vivid examples, from different angles, prove Mao's basic Marxist-Leninist principle: the people are the creators of history, and the masses are the true heroes.

Believing in this principle or opposing it is the dividing line between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line. The current struggle between the two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has always revolved around the issue of what stance and attitude to take towards the people. The proletarian revolutionary line, represented by Chairman Mao, firmly believes in the people, relies on the people, and respects the people's pioneering spirit, thus possessing invincible power. The bourgeois reactionary line does not believe in the people, does not rely on the people, and even suppresses the people's revolutionary actions. Their line has been defeated by the people who create history and has been declared bankrupt.

We must follow Chairman Mao, follow Mao Zedong Thought, rely on the people, believe in the people, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. We must also, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's statements about the mass line, forever be with the people, and do revolution together.

    真正的铜墙铁壁
    战群
    毛主席说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”
    无限信任群众，坚决依靠群众，是毛主席一贯的思想，是我军的光荣传统，是革命战争战略战术原则的基础，也是每一个革命战士必须遵守的信条。群众是真正的英雄，是革命战争舞台上的主角。我们革命军队的指挥员，只是千千万万个群众指挥员的代表，决不可高踞于群众之上，当贵族式的指挥员，自作聪明，闭门造车，打“老爷仗”。我们必须以普通一兵的身份，深入到群众之中，老老实实向群众请教，从群众中吸取战胜敌人的勇气和智慧；到战斗最艰苦、最激烈的地方去，和群众共生死，同命运。只有这样，才能实现正确的指挥。
    一九四五年二月，我八路军某团奉命拔除日寇在山西省腹地马坊镇的一个核心据点。这个据点在镇东的山头上，鬼子花了两年时间，长期经营，用坚石砌起五丈多高，两丈多厚的寨墙。寨墙四角各有一个石头碉堡，寨墙外还有一圈铁丝网，只有一个寨门出入。据点里住着鬼子一个大队，装备有钢炮和机枪，配备电台，一有情况，援兵随呼随到。鬼子依托这个据点，只消一天行程，就可以到周围昔阳、寿阳、榆次、和顺四个县烧杀抢掠。当地人民恨之入骨，切盼早日打下鬼子据点。当时，我们装备很差，既没有大炮，也没有炸药，称得上“重武器”的只有一门迫击炮。这样差的装备条件打那样坚固的堡垒，靠什么？就是靠群众的力量。
    团首长受领任务后，亲到马坊镇了解敌人情况。当地群众听说八路军要打鬼子据点，纷纷向我军控诉鬼子的暴行，介绍鬼子的活动情况。鬼子很狡猾，寨子里不住一个中国人；但是，侵略者毕竟是在中国土地上，离了中国人就无法生存，还是弄了一个中国联络员，可是他也只能住在寨墙外一间小屋子里。就是这个唯一能接近鬼子的中国人，给我军提供了重要的情报。又是在他和群众的帮助下，团首长和准备担任突击队的连排干部，先后化装进入据点，作了进一步侦察。这样，依靠群众，我们掌握了从敌人兵力部署到生活细节等全部情况。相反，由于群众严密封锁消息，鬼子却像瞎子聋子一样，一点不知道我们的活动。
    根据上级指示和所得情况，团首长和群众共同研究了作战计划。按照当时情况，显然不能强攻，只能奇袭。要奇袭成功，还得通过几道难关：首先是，八十多人的突击队，在鬼子哨兵眼皮底下，怎样才能隐蔽地通过二十多丈的大雪地，进入寨门边的窑洞里潜伏起来？大家提出：突击队全部穿上厚棉袜，就可以毫无声息地进入潜伏地。第二，何时发起攻击最有利？群众建议选在早上六点，这时，鬼子已打开寨门，四个碉堡的岗哨都撤下来了，只留下寨门口一个哨兵，全部鬼子都在吃饭，毫无防备，可以打敌措手不及。大家还提出：组织一个大刀班，用冷兵战解决鬼子的门卫班，就不会惊动据点里的鬼子。这个集中群众智慧制订的作战计划，在战斗中得到了完满的实现。
    当地群众为了支援我军作战，连夜赶制了八十多双棉袜和十几把大刀。地方武装和游击队全部出动，准备打援和牵制附近的鬼子据点，积极配合我们行动。马坊镇的群众组织起来，在村边路口，站岗放哨，控制来往行人，防奸保密，封锁消息。战斗发起后，部队按照预定计划冲进寨门，经过激烈的拚杀，把据点的鬼子全部歼灭。在地方武装和游击队的有力牵制下，附近据点的鬼子自顾不暇，也无力赶来救援了。
    马坊战斗再次证明毛主席的英明论断：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”动员起来的革命群众，是真正的铜墙铁壁，是陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海，是烧死一切“野牛”的火阵，是我们进行革命战争的力量源泉。几十年来，我们就是遵循着毛主席的革命路线，依靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众和士兵群众，打败了国内外强大的敌人，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    过去打仗依靠人民群众，今后打仗更要依靠人民群众。做任何革命工作，只有相信群众，依靠群众，才能够在革命大道上排除万难，胜利前进。如果不是这样，就什么也看不见，什么也听不见，什么知识也没有，什么本事也没有，什么事也干不成。甚至会迷失方向，丧失信心，忘记革命，落进机会主义的深渊。
    编后
    本版发表的几篇文章，是工农兵学习毛主席论人民是创造历史的动力等有关语录的体会。
    国营上海有色冶炼厂是一个设备非常简陋的工厂，但是，有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，就能制造出硫酸锌和紫铜粉。江苏邗江县方巷大队，有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的农民，就能把“野鸭塘”变成米粮仓。在抗日战争中，某团没有重武器，依靠人民群众，就能拔掉日寇的坚固碉堡。这几个生动的事例，从各个不同的角度，证明了毛主席讲的这个马克思列宁主义的基本原理：人民是创造历史的动力，群众是真正的英雄。
    相信这一原理，还是反对这一原理，是无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的分水岭。当前无产阶级文化大革命中两条路线的斗争，一直围绕着对待群众采取什么立场，采取什么态度的问题上。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，所以，具有战无不胜的无比威力。资产阶级反动路线不相信群众，不依靠群众，甚至压制群众的革命行动。他们的路线在创造历史的人民群众的反击下，终于宣告破产。
    我们一定要紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，依靠群众，相信群众，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们还要在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席关于群众路线的论述，永远和群众在一起干革命。
