The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam, who are fighting on the front lines of the anti-American war, are extremely indignant at the heinous crime of the American air pirates attacking the capital, Hanoi, on December 2. They have sent telegrams to relevant units in North Vietnam, expressing their determination to fight more fiercely and accurately on the battlefield and give the American aggressors a more severe punishment.

A telegram from the West Saigon-Cho Lon region committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to the Hanoi committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front states that the U.S. imperialists' attack on Hanoi is a very serious new "escalation" in their war of aggression against Vietnam, committing new crimes against the Vietnamese people.

The telegram says that the U.S. aggressors' violation of the heart of the motherland can only arouse the great indignation of all Vietnamese military and civilian people, prompting us to further strengthen our strikes against the enemy.

The telegram expresses that the military and civilian people of the West Saigon-Cho Lon region will spare no effort and redouble their efforts to give the U.S. puppet troops a fatal blow, achieve greater victories in the winter and spring, and contribute to the cause of national reunification.

A telegram from a unit of the liberation armed forces in Binh Dinh Province, which has achieved two great victories at Long Phu, states: The victories of the military and civilian people of Hanoi and North Vietnam are all inspirations for us, strengthening our confidence in the anti-American, national salvation struggle.

The telegram expresses that in the coming period, the liberation armed forces will definitely penetrate deep into the enemy's rear, deal heavier blows to the enemy, and make the American aggressors pay a thousandfold for their blood debt.

A telegram from a unit of the liberation armed forces in Quang Ngai Province, which recently foiled a major "sweep" by 30,000 U.S. puppet troops, states: Recently, the military and civilian people of Hanoi and North Vietnam have shot down twelve American planes. This is a well-deserved punishment for the American aggressors' new war "escalation."

The telegram expresses the determination to fight more fiercely and accurately with all South Vietnamese military and civilian people, avenging the compatriots killed by the American aggressors.

The liberation armed forces of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam, from November 16 to 27, continuously attacked the enemy in Cam Lo and Hai Lang counties, killing and dissolving nearly 400 U.S. puppet troops, completely annihilating a puppet main force company and a self-defense platoon, shooting down one helicopter, and damaging three M-113 amphibious armored vehicles.

On November 27, in a ambush battle in Hai Lang County, this provincial liberation armed forces killed 200 enemy troops, completely annihilating a puppet company.

According to another report, on November 17, the liberation armed forces of Quang Nam Province launched a fierce attack on the marching puppet troops in Tam Ky County, Quang Nam Province, annihilating an enemy company and a platoon.

Under the heavy blows of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam, the U.S. aggressor troops suffered heavy casualties and their morale was extremely low. The picture shows the American aggressors, who were severely beaten by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam, bowing their heads in prayer, begging God to save their lives.
