	Editorial Note

	Today, we have selected to publish the revolutionary story "A Magnificent Youth" and the short performance "Cai Yongxiang Loves the 'Three Articles' the Most." These two works enthusiastically praise Cai Yongxiang, a communist warrior who dedicated himself to the public good.

	Holding "revolutionary story sessions" and small-scale singing and speaking performances are convenient and popular forms of art that are widely welcomed by the masses for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of people hope to receive vivid and concrete education in Mao Zedong Thought from these story sessions and small-scale performances.

	To meet the readers' demands, we plan to successively publish good revolutionary stories and excellent singing and speaking works. We hope everyone will recommend good works in this area to us.

    今天，我们选登了革命故事《壮丽的青春》和小演唱《蔡永祥最爱“老三篇”》。这两篇作品热情地歌颂了一心为公的共产主义战士蔡永祥同志。
    举办“革命故事会”和小型说唱文艺晚会，是宣传毛泽东思想的一种简便易行、深受群众欢迎的文艺形式。广大群众很希望从这些故事会、小型晚会中，生动具体地受到毛泽东思想的教育。
    为了满足读者的要求，我们准备陆续选登好的革命故事、好的说唱作品，希望大家向我们推荐这方面的好作品。
