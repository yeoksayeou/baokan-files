During the period when the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe visited various parts of Japan, Japanese friends frequently requested copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from the Chinese performers. When they received this precious revolutionary book, they were overjoyed and felt extremely excited.

A Japanese friend named Sasakawa Katsu in Osaka asked a Chinese performer for a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." When he received the shiny red book, he excitedly said, "Only Mao Zedong Thought can bring victory to the Chinese people, and similarly, only Mao Zedong Thought can bring victory to the world revolution."

A spectator named Hayashi Akimasa from Kanagawa Prefecture requested a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from a Chinese performer after watching the Beijing Song and Dance Troupe's performance in Tokyo for the first time. The Chinese performer gave him the copy they were using. He was overjoyed. A few days later, when the troupe performed near his residence, he specially went backstage to find the Chinese performer who had given him the book and presented him with a letter written on red paper. The letter said, "I will cherish the book of Chairman Mao you gave me forever. I love Chairman Mao and the Chinese people. As long as we hold hands, we can exchange feelings." When the troupe returned to Tokyo after performing in other places, he once again rushed to the theater to give the troupe member five red pens. He said, "I know you read Chairman Mao's book every day. These red pens are for you to use when reading Chairman Mao's book."

The troupe members often read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" aloud. Japanese friends who assisted the troupe also read along loudly. A young Japanese female interpreter, when parting with the Chinese troupe members, made an agreement: "You in Beijing, we in Tokyo, let's study Chairman Mao's works together and walk the revolutionary path for life."

    读了红书心更红
    中国北京歌舞团到日本各地进行访问演出的期间，经常有日本朋友向中国演员索取《毛主席语录》。当他们得到这本革命宝书时，他们就欢欣鼓舞，感到无比兴奋。
    大阪市一位名叫佐佐木胜的日本朋友向中国演员要一册《毛主席语录》。当他拿到那本红光闪闪的宝书时激动地说：“只有毛泽东思想才能使中国人民胜利，同样也只有毛泽东思想才能使世界革命胜利。”
    神奈川县的观众叶秋本茂，第一次在东京看北京歌舞团演出时，要求中国演员送给他一册《毛主席语录》，中国演员把自己学习的那本送给了他。他高兴极了。几天以后，歌舞团到他居住的附近地方演出时，他特意到后台找到送给他语录的中国演员，送了一封用红纸写的信。信上说：“我将把你们送给我的毛主席的书，珍贵地保存到永久。我热爱毛主席和中国人民。我们之间只要挽起手来，就可以互相交流感情。”当歌舞团从外地演出再度回到东京时，他又一次赶到剧场，给这位团员送来了五支红笔。他说：“我知道你们每天都读毛主席的书。送给你们这些红笔，读毛主席的书时使用吧。”
    歌舞团的团员经常朗读毛主席语录。帮助歌舞团工作的日本朋友也大声跟着朗读。一位年轻的日本女翻译人员同中国团员分手时约定：你们在北京，我们在东京，共同学习毛主席著作，走一辈子革命的道路。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（据新华社讯）
