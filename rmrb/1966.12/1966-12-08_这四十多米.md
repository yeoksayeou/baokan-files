	This forty plus meters...
	Gong Xianming

	Cai Yongxiang's life is one of following Chairman Mao in revolution. On the early morning of October 10, he bravely rushed out in front of the speeding train, covering this forty plus meters. This is the peak of the hero's journey into the spiritual world of communism.

	This forty plus meters is a matter of life and death, a severe test! At this moment, if there is even a speck of dust or a hint of weakness in one's heart, one would not dare to take this step!

	However, why was Cai Yongxiang able to bravely take this forty plus meters? Let us see how long the path connected to these forty plus meters is... Look: Cai Yongxiang walked this path, listening to his mother tell stories of hardship, hearing tales of revolutionary struggle, singing "The East Is Red" as he went to school, and wearing Chairman Mao's portrait badge as he worked in the fields. Look: Cai Yongxiang, with deep class feelings, firmly stepped into the ranks; he bought Chairman Mao's works with his first allowance; he went to find his platoon leader to report on his study of the "Three Articles"; after standing night watch, he would go to the lamppost to read the "Three Articles" again. ... He walked this path, helping workers carry coal, helping the commune pick cotton, helping comrades feed pigs, standing guard in wind and rain, daring to face a raging fire, daring to cross raging waters. This son of a poor peasant grew up under the influence of Mao Zedong Thought. Because he loves Mao Zedong Thought, daring to break down the "self" in his mind and establish the "public," Cai Yongxiang could stand tall and proud, full of fighting spirit, bravely advancing on the great road of Mao Zedong Thought!

	It is clear that before these forty plus meters, he had already taken several thousand, several ten thousand steps of forty plus meters! Precisely because of the training of these several thousand, several ten thousand steps of forty plus meters, and the constant "seizing the day" self-reform, in the critical moment, he was able to have this forty plus meters of earth-shaking "sprint"!

    这四十多米……
    龚贤明
    蔡永祥的一生，是跟着毛主席干革命的一生。十月十日凌晨，他迎着飞奔的列车冲出的这四十多米，则是英雄跨入共产主义精神世界历程的一个顶点。
    这四十多米，是生死的关口，是严峻的考验！在这个时候，心里只要沾上一粒灰尘，有一分软骨，就跨不出去，就不敢上！
    然而，这四十多米，为什么蔡永祥能够勇敢地去冲？让我们看看，和这四十多米连着的路程该有多长……。看吧：蔡永祥走在这条路上，听过母亲讲苦难的家史，听过革命斗争的故事，唱着《东方红》去上学，挂着毛主席像纪念章去种田。看吧：蔡永祥怀着阶级深情，坚定地跨进连队；他第一次领到津贴费，就去买毛主席著作；他跑去找排长，第一次汇报的就是学习“老三篇”的心得；站好夜班岗回来，先走到路灯下再读一读“老三篇”。……他走在这条路上，帮助工人挑煤，帮助公社摘棉花，帮助战友喂猪，顶着风雨站岗执勤，弥天大火敢上，滔滔江水敢闯。他这个贫农的儿子，靠着毛泽东思想的熏陶成长起来。只因为他热爱毛泽东思想，勇于在头脑中大破私字，大立公字，蔡永祥才能这样地昂首挺胸，斗志昂扬，奋勇地前进在毛泽东思想的大路上！
    很清楚，在这四十多米以前，他已经跨出了几千个、几万个四十多米！正由于这几千个、几万个四十多米的锻炼，由于平时不断地“只争朝夕”地改造自己，在紧急关头，他才能有这四十多米震天动地的“冲刺”！
