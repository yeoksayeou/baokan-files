    A revolutionary, if he does not use Mao Zedong Thought to reform his soul, even if his background is good, cannot withstand the infiltration of bourgeois ideology.

    Only the Self-Aware Red Can Remain Red Forever

    Driver Hu Chundong

    In the past, I did not want to hear the words "thought reform." I always felt that thought reform was for those with bad backgrounds or those who had made mistakes. Someone like me, born into a family of three generations of railway workers, had nothing to reform.

    Is that really the case? No, not at all.

    In the early years of my work, the contradictions in my thoughts were not very pronounced. At that time, with the idea of repaying the Party's kindness, I worked hard from dawn to dusk, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, and always received praise. This made me feel that I did not need to undergo thought reform to serve the people well. However, as time went on, my enthusiasm gradually waned, and thoughts of personal gain began to creep in unknowingly. Take driving the train, for example. The cargo volume on the Jingguan line is large, and sometimes I have to work four or five consecutive night shifts. The work is quite tiring, and I always wanted to ask the dispatcher to delay the train for a day, changing the night shift to a day shift. When the piecework wage system was implemented, whenever the end of the month approached and I saw that I was still short of one or two trips, I hoped that the train would not be delayed at that time. Whether delaying the train is something to hope for or to fear, it all stems from "me." The more I thought of myself, the less comfortable I felt working, and instead, I felt more and more troubled.

    Later, with the help of the leadership, I studied the "Three Articles" and other articles by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said, "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the people's interests." Chairman Mao also said, "In the process of building a socialist society, everyone needs to be reformed, the exploiters need to be reformed, and the laborers also need to be reformed." Chairman Mao's words seemed to be directed at me. I measured myself with the standards of "completely" and "thoroughly," and the more I measured, the more my face burned, and the more I realized that there is no such thing as being red from the start.

    Since then, my awareness of the need for thought reform has increased somewhat. In recent years, people often ask me, "You have been on this train, from stoking the fire to driving it, for nearly twenty years. Others have been promoted, and now only you, the five-generation elder, are left!" At first, when I heard these remarks, my heart stirred a bit. But when I opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao's words shone brightly in my mind: "An foreigner, with no selfish motives, regarded the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause. What kind of spirit is this? This is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism. Every member of the Communist Party of China should learn this spirit." Compared to Comrade Bethune, I, as a Communist Party member, have a huge gap. I realized: In one's life, there will indeed be various changes, but the thought of serving the people must never change. Later, when I heard someone make such remarks, I would confidently reply, "I can drive a train for the people for a lifetime, and this is my greatest happiness!"

    In the process of thought reform, I deeply felt that a true revolutionary, if he does not use Mao Zedong Thought to reform his soul and establish a proletarian worldview, even if his background is good, cannot withstand the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and is easily corrupted. The proletarian worldview cannot be spontaneously generated; only by constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly reform one's soul can it gradually be formed. Only by letting Mao Zedong Thought fill one's mind more and more and take root more deeply can one always be a faithful servant of the people.

### “自觉红”才能红到底

    一个革命者，如果不用毛泽东思想改造灵魂，即使出身再好，也经不起资产阶级思想的侵蚀。
   “自觉红”才能红到底
    司机　胡春东
    过去，我不愿意听“思想改造”这个词，总觉得思想改造是对那些出身不好的、或者犯过错误的人说的。像我这样出身在三代铁路工人家庭的人，没有什么需要改造的。
    真的是这样吗？不，一千个不是，一万个不是。
    在上车的头几年里，我思想上的矛盾还不很大。当时，我怀着报答党的恩情的思想，起早贪黑，不怕苦，不怕累，一个劲地干，经常受到表扬。这样一来，更感到自己用不着进行思想改造也能很好地为人民服务了。可是，时间一长，干劲慢慢地不足了，为个人打算的思想不知不觉地多起来了。拿跑车来说吧，京山线货运任务大，有时要连续干四、五个夜班，工作比较累，我总想要求调度员压一天火，把夜班调成白班。在实行计件工资的时候，每逢到月底，一看还差一、两趟车，心里就希望不要在这个时候压火。同样是压火，一个是盼压火，一个是怕压火，都是从“我”字出发。替自己打算的多了，工作起来心里也不像过去那样舒畅了，相反，越来越感到苦恼。
    后来，在领导的帮助下，我学习了“老三篇”和毛主席的其他文章。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”毛主席还说：“在建设社会主义社会的过程中，人人需要改造，剥削者要改造，劳动者也要改造”。毛主席的话，好像句句都是针对我说的。我用“完全”、“彻底”两把尺子量自己，越量脸上越发烧，越量越认识到“自来红”是根本没有的事。
    从这以后，我对思想改造的自觉性比较高了一些。这几年经常有人问我：“你在这台车上，从烧火到开车已经干了将近二十年，人家都提升了，现在就剩下你这位五代元老啦！”开始，我听到这些议论，心里也有一点活动。当我打开《纪念白求恩》，毛主席的话就在我脑子里放出万丈光芒：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，每一个中国共产党员都要学习这种精神。”我作为一个共产党员，和白求恩同志比较，差距太大了。我认识到：人的一生中，确实会遇到这样那样的变动，但是千变万变，为人民服务的思想永远不能变。以后，再听到有人这样议论，我就理直气壮地回答：“我能为人民开一辈子火车，这是我最大的幸福！”
    在思想改造的过程中，我深深体会到：一个真正的革命者，如果不用毛泽东思想改造灵魂，不树立起无产阶级世界观，即使出身再好，也经不起资产阶级思想的侵蚀，容易变质。无产阶级的世界观，不可能自发地产生，只有不断地用毛泽东思想狠狠地改造自己的灵魂，才能逐步地形成。也只有让毛泽东思想在自己的头脑里越装越多、越扎越深，才能永远做个为人民服务的忠实的勤务员。
