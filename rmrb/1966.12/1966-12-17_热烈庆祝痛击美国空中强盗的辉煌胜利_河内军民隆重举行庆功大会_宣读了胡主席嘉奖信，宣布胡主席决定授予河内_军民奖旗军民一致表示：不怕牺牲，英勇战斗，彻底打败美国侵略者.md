Hanoi's military and civilians held a grand victory celebration on the evening of the 15th to enthusiastically celebrate the glorious victory of shooting down eight American pirate planes in the battle to defend the capital on the 14th, shattering the arrogant attacks of the American air pirates. The military and civilians of Hanoi who attended the meeting unanimously declared that they would, together with the military and civilians of the entire country, fear neither hardship nor sacrifice, fight bravely, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

Chen Youyi, Minister of the State Council of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, first read at the meeting the letter of commendation from Chairman Ho Chi Minh to the military and civilians of Hanoi, and announced that Chairman Ho Chi Minh had decided to award a banner to the military and civilians of Hanoi that reads, "Determined to Defeat the American Aggressors."

General Vo Nguyen Giap, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, also spoke at the meeting. He highly praised the spirit of decisive victory of the military and civilians of Hanoi. Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that the continuous bombing of Hanoi by American pirate planes in no way indicates the strength of American imperialism, but rather exposes its weakness and brutal nature. The American aggressors are moving from one failure to another, falling into a desperate situation. Vo Nguyen Giap said that American imperialism thought that by continuously bombing Hanoi, it could shake the fighting will of the Vietnamese people, which is a grave mistake. The iron will of the Vietnamese people is: as long as there is one American aggressor left on Vietnamese soil, the Vietnamese people will fight, fight, and fight again until they achieve final victory.

Vo Nguyen Giap called on the military and civilians of Hanoi to continue to carry forward the spirit of brave fighting, follow the teachings of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and together with all military and civilians, be determined to defeat the American aggressors and push the anti-American national salvation war to complete victory.

Chen Weixing, Chairman of the Administrative Committee of Hanoi, also spoke at the meeting. Chen Weixing called on the military and civilians of the capital to maintain high alert, fight bravely, vigorously promote production, and strengthen people's air defense work, shoot down more American pirate planes, and successfully complete the glorious task of defending the heroic capital.

Representatives of the people's air defense forces, people's air force, and self-defense militia units, who have made brilliant achievements in the recent battles to defend the capital, also expressed their fighting resolve at the meeting.

At the end of the meeting, the entire audience sang the battle song "Liberate the South" in unison.

    军民奖旗军民一致表示：不怕牺牲，英勇战斗，彻底打败美国侵略者
    新华社河内十六日电　河内市军民十五日晚上隆重举行庆功大会，热烈庆祝在十四日保卫首都的战斗中，一举击落美国强盗飞机八架，粉碎了美国空中强盗猖狂进攻的辉煌胜利。参加大会的河内市军民一致表示，他们誓同全国军民一道，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，英勇战斗，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    越南民主共和国总理府部长陈友翼首先在会上宣读了胡志明主席给河内市军民的嘉奖信，并宣布胡主席决定授予河内市军民一面“决心战胜美国侵略强盗”奖旗。
    越南劳动党中央政治局委员、政府副总理兼国防部长武元甲大将在会上讲了话。他热烈赞扬河内市军民的决战决胜精神。武元甲指出，美国强盗飞机连续轰炸河内市，这丝毫也不表明美帝国主义的强大，相反，只能暴露它的虚弱和残暴的本质。美国侵略者正从一个失败走向另一个失败，陷入了走投无路的困境。武元甲说，美帝国主义以为连续轰炸河内市，就可以动摇越南人民的战斗意志，这是大错特错了。越南人民的钢铁般的决心是：只要还有一个美国侵略者留在越南国土上，越南人民就战斗、战斗、再战斗，直到取得最后胜利。
    武元甲号召河内市军民继续发扬英勇战斗的精神，遵循胡志明主席的教导，同全体军民一起，决心战胜美国侵略强盗，把抗美救国战争推向完全胜利。
    河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴也在会上讲了话。陈维兴号召首都军民继续保持高度警惕，勇敢战斗，大力促进生产和加强人民防空工作，打落更多的美国强盗飞机，胜利完成保卫英雄首都的光荣任务。
    连日来在保卫首都的战斗中立下了光辉战功的人民军防空部队、人民空军、民兵自卫队的代表们，也纷纷在大会上表达了他们的战斗决心。
    大会结束时，全场同声高唱《解放南方》的战歌。
