Under the shadow of white terror in Indonesia, the right-wing reactionary forces have been madly anti-communist, anti-people, anti-Chinese, and anti-overseas Chinese, turning the beautiful and rich archipelago into a living hell.

However, where there is oppression, there is resistance. Over a thousand patriotic overseas Chinese, driven by the Indonesian reactionaries to the refugee "shelter" at the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School, rallied together under the great inspiration and encouragement of Mao Zedong Thought, forming a fighting collective. They not only drove away American provocateurs five times but also repelled an attack by 400 right-wing thugs organized by the military authorities, achieving a significant victory in their struggle against violence.

Yet another provocation!

On November 9 this year, after several organized and planned provocations against the refugees at the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School, the Indonesian right-wing reactionaries launched another brazen attack.

That morning at around seven o'clock, over four hundred male and female thugs, under the orders of the Medan military authorities, gathered outside the fence on the left side of the "shelter," screaming wildly: "Drive out the Chinese!" "Expel the Chinese residents!" "The Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School belongs to us!"

At first, the refugees ignored the thugs' provocations. The thugs, thinking the refugees were weak and easy to bully, gave the order at around eight-thirty in the morning. About fifty or sixty thugs, their heads wrapped in black cloth, armed with axes, clubs, and stones, pushed over the fence and rushed towards the refugees. They smashed open the refugees' boxes with axes, looting valuable items and destroying what they couldn't take.

Just as the thugs who had rushed in were wreaking havoc and looting, the thugs standing outside the fence howled like wolves, singing reactionary songs. The soldiers guarding the "shelter" laughed and clapped along with the thugs' songs. They also fired shots into the air to prevent and suppress the refugees from self-defense and resistance.

When pushed to the limit, the refugees remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching: "If someone does not offend me, I will not offend them; if someone offends me, I will certainly offend them." To protect the lawful rights of the overseas Chinese and defend the dignity of the motherland and the nation, they could no longer tolerate the thugs' rampage. Everyone roared: "Charge! Drive out the lackeys of American imperialism!" Over two hundred unarmed refugees surged forward like a tide, charging towards the thugs who were wreaking havoc.

The refugees' hearts burned with anger against the Indonesian reactionaries. They fearlessly fought face-to-face with the savage thugs. The refugees shouted angrily: "Charge forward to defend the dignity of the motherland!" "Avenge the harmed compatriots!"

This was a struggle for self-defense by the oppressed! This was a necessary resistance! This was a just struggle!

In the face of the irresistible self-defense and anti-violence struggle, many thugs were frightened, their faces pale, panicking and hastily throwing away the things they had looted, retreating back outside the fence to catch their breath.

However, the enemy did not accept defeat. Soon, the thugs launched a second attack on the refugees. Over a hundred thugs divided into three groups counterattacked the "shelter." At the same time, the large crowd of thugs gathered around the "shelter" threw stones, madly attacking the refugees.

The refugees, under a "hail of stones," immediately counterattacked, determined to give the enemy a severe lesson. Over twenty overseas Chinese, at this moment, used two pots of boiling water as weapons, scooping and pouring it over the advancing thugs. The thugs at the front were instantly scalded, screaming, and the thugs behind quickly fled. The refugees guarding the dining hall and the houses used large wooden boxes as cover until the thugs approached, then leaped up to give the thugs a fierce blow. Many thugs who had just been snarling now cried and begged for mercy from the brave refugees.

The most intense part of the struggle was the "stone battle."

Originally, the thugs had prepared for the attack on the refugees, burying piles of stones in the soil near the "shelter." After launching the attack, they continuously dug out stones, madly throwing them at the refugees. Stones fell like rain on the roofs and courtyards of the "shelter," shattering tiles, breaking light bulbs, and injuring many overseas Chinese, leaving them with broken heads and bleeding wounds.

At this time, the refugees' emotions were even more indignant. They encouraged each other: "The enemy treats us so cruelly, so we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and use the methods of imperialism and reactionaries against them!" They picked up the stones thrown by the thugs and threw them back. The refugees used iron buckets as helmets, wrapped their heads with towels, and under the "stone rain," they fought back while holding their ground, not giving an inch. Many refugee women who had not participated in the battle also put down their children and joined the men in the self-defense battle. A young woman handed her youngest child to an older girl to take care of, picked up a broom from the ground, and bravely rushed downstairs to drive away the thugs. Over ten young female teachers and students quickly bandaged the wounds of over sixty injured refugees in the first aid room. Refugees with minor injuries, after having their wounds bandaged, immediately returned to the battle.

The "stone battle" continued for over two hours, and the thugs retreated step by step. A refugee woman, while chasing the thugs, shouted loudly: "Don't run, I'll fight you to the end!" The thugs were so frightened that they didn't dare to look back, running away as fast as they could.

The Medan refugees' just struggle against violence greatly inspired the broad masses of overseas Chinese in Indonesia who were suffering in deep waters and fiery pits. Refugees in over ten "shelters" in the Medan area drew a common conclusion from this victory in the struggle against violence: We must not harbor any illusions about the Indonesian reactionaries. The more the Indonesian reactionaries madly persecute the overseas Chinese, the more it will arouse the overseas Chinese's even stronger resistance. Many people confidently and firmly declared: We are overseas Chinese armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with a powerful socialist motherland as our backing, and with the sympathy and support of the broad masses of the Indonesian people, we will certainly achieve greater victories in the struggle against persecution.

    为了保卫祖国的尊严
    ——记棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”的抗暴斗争
    在白色恐怖笼罩下的印度尼西亚，右派反动势力疯狂地反共反人民，反华排华，使美丽富饶的千岛之国变成了人间地狱。
    但是，有压迫就有反抗。被印尼反动派驱赶到棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”的一千多名爱国华侨，在伟大的毛泽东思想的感召和鼓舞下，团结起来，结成一个战斗的集体，不仅曾经五次怒逐前来挑衅的美国佬，而且还打退过陆军当局组织的四百名右派暴徒的进攻，取得了抗暴斗争的重大胜利。
        又一次新的挑衅！
    今年十一月九日，印尼右派反动势力在多次对棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”的华侨进行挑衅之后，又一次有组织有计划的猖狂袭击开始了。
    这天上午七时许，四百多名男女暴徒，在棉兰陆军当局的指使下，聚集在“收容所”左侧的篱笆外面，不停地疯狂叫喊：“驱逐支那人！”“把中国侨民赶出去！”“棉兰华侨中学归我们！”
    起初，难侨们没有理会暴徒的挑衅。暴徒们以为难侨软弱可欺，到了上午八时半左右，暴徒头目一声令下，头缠黑布的暴徒五六十人拿着利斧、木棒、石头，推倒篱笆，向难侨扑来。他们用利斧劈开华侨的箱子，搜劫值钱的东西，抢不走的就捣得稀烂。
    正当冲进来的暴徒们大肆破坏和抢劫的时候，站在篱笆和围墙外边的暴徒，像狼嚎似地狂唱反动歌曲。那些看守“收容所”的军人，嘻嘻哈哈地随着暴徒们的歌声打拍子。他们还朝天开枪，阻止并镇压难侨进行自卫反抗。
        人若犯我，我必犯人
    这时，实在忍无可忍、退无可退的难侨们，想起了毛主席的伟大教导：“人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人。”他们为了保卫华侨的合法权益，捍卫祖国和民族的尊严，再也不能听任暴徒肆虐了。大家怒吼起来：“冲！把美帝国主义走狗赶出去！”二百多个赤手空拳的难侨就像怒潮一样，向正在逞凶的暴徒冲了过去。
    难侨们心头燃烧着对印尼反动派的怒火，奋不顾身地同凶残的暴徒展开了面对面的搏斗。难侨们愤怒地高喊：“为保卫祖国的尊严向前冲啊！”“为受害侨胞们报仇啊！”
    这是被迫害者的自卫！这是应有的反抗！这是正义的斗争！
    在势不可当的自卫抗暴斗争面前，很多暴徒被吓得面色灰白，慌张失措，连忙扔掉抢到手的东西，奔回到篱笆外面站着喘气。
    以其人之道，还治其人之身
    但是，敌人并没有甘心失败。不久，暴徒们又向难侨发起了第二次进攻，有一百多名暴徒分三路向“收容所”反扑。与此同时，聚集在“收容所”周围的大批暴徒，也向“收容所”里投掷石头，疯狂地袭击难侨。
    难侨们冒着“石头雨”，立即分头迎击，决心再狠狠地教训敌人。有二十多位华侨，这时把两锅沸腾的开水当作武器，一勺一勺地泼向来犯的暴徒。冲在最前头的暴徒，一下子被浇得哇哇叫，后面的暴徒连忙抱头鼠窜。守卫在饭厅与平房里的难侨，用大木箱做掩护体，直到暴徒逼近的时候，一跃而起，给暴徒以迎头痛击。许多刚才还张牙舞爪的暴徒，这时却哭丧着脸，向英勇自卫的难侨们求饶。
    在袭击和反袭击的整个斗争中，最激烈的是一场场的“石头战”。
    原来，暴徒们早就做好袭击难侨的准备，预先把成堆的石头埋在“收容所”附近的泥土里。他们发起攻击后，不停地挖出石头，疯狂地向难侨投掷。石头像雨点似地落到“收容所”的屋顶和院子里，瓦片被砸碎，电灯泡被打破，不少华侨被石头打得头破血流。
    这时，难侨们的情绪愈加激愤，他们互相鼓励：“敌人这样凶狠地对待我们，我们就一定要遵照毛主席的教导，以帝国主义和反动派之道，还治帝国主义和反动派之身！”他们纷纷拾起暴徒们扔进来的石头，又对准暴徒掷回去。难侨们拿起铁桶当钢盔，用毛巾包着头，冒着“石雨”，一面还击，一面顶住阵脚，寸土不让。许多原来没有参加战斗的难侨妇女，也放下怀中的孩子，同男难侨一起参加自卫战斗。有一个青年妇女，把怀中最小的孩子交给大女孩照管，从地上操起一把扫帚，勇敢地冲下楼来驱赶暴徒。十多位年青女教师和学生，在救护室里敏捷地给受伤的六十多位难侨上药包扎。受轻伤的难侨在包扎好伤口后，马上又投入了战斗。
    “石头战”继续了两个多小时，暴徒们节节败退。一位华侨妇女一面追赶暴徒，一面厉声高喊：“你们不要走，我跟你们拚了！”暴徒们吓得头也不敢回，只管拚命往外跑。
    棉兰难侨这次正义的抗暴斗争，大大鼓舞了处于水深火热中的广大印尼华侨。棉兰地区十多个难侨“收容所”里的难侨们，从这次抗暴斗争的胜利中得出了一个共同的结论：我们决不能对印尼反动派抱任何幻想。印尼反动派越是疯狂地迫害华侨，只能激起华侨更加强烈的反抗。许多人充满信心坚定地表示：我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的爱国华侨，有强大的社会主义祖国做后盾，有广大印尼人民的同情和支持，我们一定能够取得反迫害斗争的更大胜利。　新华社记者
