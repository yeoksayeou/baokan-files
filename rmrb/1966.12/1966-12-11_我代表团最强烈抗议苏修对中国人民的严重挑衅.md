The World Federation of Trade Unions, under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionists, illegally stripped our delegation of the right to attend the conference. Our delegation strongly protests the Soviet revisionists' serious provocation against the Chinese people. The Soviet revisionists fear the truth of Mao Zedong Thought, revealing their extreme weakness. Chinese workers and trade unions will steadfastly advance on the path of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism to victory.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Sofia on the 9th, the 16th Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, held in Sofia, was manipulated and meticulously planned by the Soviet revisionists. On the 8th, they brazenly and illegally stripped the Chinese trade union delegation of the right to attend the 16th Executive Committee meeting, staging an unprecedented anti-China farce in the history of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The Chinese trade union delegation attending the meeting firmly fought against and strongly protested the serious provocation launched by the Soviet revisionist clique against the great Chinese working class and people.

The 16th Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions opened on the 6th. On the 7th, the meeting's presiding chairman slandered the Chinese representative as "anti-Soviet" and unreasonably interrupted the speech of Han Xiya, the head of the Chinese delegation, on the first agenda item. On the morning of the 8th, the Chinese delegation continued to request to speak, but was again unreasonably rejected by the meeting's presiding chairman. Later, when Lu Zongying, the deputy head of the Chinese delegation, spoke on the second agenda item and exposed the amendment to the World Federation of Trade Unions' charter as serving the class capitulation line of Soviet revisionism, the presiding chairman openly announced a recess, interrupting the Chinese representative's speech. Subsequently, the Soviet trade union leaders and their followers, after nearly two hours of backstage plotting, had Sayan come out and announce a decision by the meeting's presidium. This decision fabricated all sorts of absurd reasons, claiming that the Chinese representatives "repeatedly violated the rules of procedure," that the members of the Chinese delegation, except for Han Xiya, "were not council members or alternate council members," and that the situation of the Chinese trade unions was "unclear," and demanded that the meeting strip the Chinese delegation of the right to attend the 16th Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Han Xiya, the head of the Chinese delegation, immediately took the podium to expose and denounce the Soviet revisionists and their followers' insane fascist behavior, pointing out that this was a serious political provocation against the Chinese trade unions and the Chinese working class.

Following this, the Albanian representative took the podium to speak, supporting the position of the Chinese delegation and condemning the despicable actions of the Soviet revisionists. At this point, the Soviet revisionists directed their lackeys, using the pretext of wanting to speak, to push and shove the Albanian representative. When the Chinese delegation stepped forward to stop their fascist behavior, the Soviet revisionists and the host country's Bulgarian trade union leaders released the burly men hidden in the venue to collide with the Chinese and Albanian representatives, pushing the Albanian representative off the podium.

The anti-China incident orchestrated by the Soviet revisionists sparked strong opposition from many representatives, who issued statements one after another, condemning the absurd decision to strip the Chinese delegation of the right to participate in the meeting.

Ignoring the opposition of many delegations, the Soviet revisionists activated the voting machine, forcibly passing the decision to strip the Chinese delegation of the right to attend the meeting with a so-called "majority."

During the voting, the delegations of Indonesia, Ceylon, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnam South Liberation Trade Union Federation, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Romania, Cuba, Japan, and others voted against it. Many delegations, including Venezuela, did not participate in the voting.

After the voting, the Chinese delegation immediately issued a statement pointing out that the Soviet revisionists' manipulation of the meeting and illegal stripping of the Chinese delegation's right to attend the meeting was a serious anti-China political incident and a new serious step they had taken on the road to splitting the international trade union movement. They must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this. The statement pointed out that who the Chinese trade unions send to attend the meeting is an internal affair of the Chinese trade unions and is something that no one has the right to interfere with. The statement also emphasized that the so-called "unclear situation" of the Chinese trade unions in the anti-China decision is a malicious provocation against the great Chinese working class, which the Chinese workers cannot tolerate.

The anti-China incident orchestrated by the Soviet revisionists at this meeting was entirely organized and planned. Before the meeting opened, some people, under the direction of the Soviet revisionists, repeatedly shouted at the executive committee meeting to "purify the atmosphere of the federation" and to "take organizational measures" against the Chinese delegation. After the meeting opened, the presiding chairman used vile means to repeatedly obstruct the Chinese representatives from speaking. On the evening of the 7th, under the direction of the Soviet revisionists, the chairman of the host country's Bulgarian trade unions rushed to the Chinese delegation's residence to pressure the Chinese representatives, attempting to make the Chinese representatives abandon their principled stance against imperialism and revisionism, but was sternly rebuked by the Chinese representatives.

On the 9th, the responsible person of the Chinese trade union delegation also spoke to the Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Sofia about the anti-China incident orchestrated by the Soviet revisionists, pointing out that the meeting's illegal stripping of the Chinese delegation's right to attend the meeting was personally planned and directed by Grishin, the leader of the Soviet trade unions, and was a component of the new wave of anti-China actions recently launched by the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The anti-China farce orchestrated by the Soviet revisionists thoroughly exposed their hypocritical and divisive nature.

The responsible person of the Chinese delegation pointed out that the Soviet revisionists meticulously planned this incident because they feared that their treacherous actions would be exposed by the Chinese representatives. They, like demons fearing the sun, fear the truth of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a manifestation of their extreme weakness.

The responsible person of the Chinese delegation finally said, "How can an ant shake a tree?" No matter what vile means the Soviet revisionists adopt, the Chinese workers and trade unions will steadfastly advance on the path of opposing imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership to victory. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought will definitely spread more widely throughout the world.

    世界工联在苏修操纵下非法剥夺我代表团出席会议的权利
    我代表团最强烈抗议苏修对中国人民的严重挑衅
    苏修害怕毛泽东思想的真理的声音，表现了他们的极端虚弱  中国工人和工会将坚定不移地在反帝反修的道路上胜利前进
    据新华社索非亚九日电　在索非亚举行的世界工联第十六次理事会会议在苏联修正主义者一手操纵和精心策划下，八日悍然非法剥夺中国工会代表团出席第十六次理事会议的权利，演出了一场世界工联历史上空前未有的反华大丑剧。出席会议的中国工会代表团对苏联修正主义集团向伟大的中国工人阶级和中国人民发动的这场严重挑衅，进行了坚决的斗争，提出了最强烈的抗议。
    世界工联第十六次理事会会议是六日开幕的。在七日的会议上，会议执行主席诬蔑中国代表“反苏”，无理中断了中国代表团长韩西雅就会议的第一项议程的发言。八日上午，中国代表团继续要求发言，但再次遭到会议执行主席的无理拒绝。后来，在中国代表团副团长卢宗英就会议第二项议程发言揭露修改世界工联章程是为苏联修正主义的阶级投降路线服务时，会议执行主席公然宣布休会，中断了中国代表的发言。接着，苏联工会领导人及其追随者经过近两小时的幕后策划，让赛扬出场宣布会议主席团的一项决定。这个决定制造种种荒谬透顶的理由，说什么中国代表“一再违反议事规则”，中国代表团的成员除韩西雅一人以外“都不是理事和候补理事”，中国工会“情况不明”等等，要求会议剥夺中国代表团出席世界工联第十六次理事会会议的权利。
    中国代表团团长韩西雅立即登上讲台，揭露并痛斥苏联修正主义者及其追随者这种丧心病狂的法西斯行为，指出这是对中国工会和中国工人阶级的严重的政治挑衅。
    接着，阿尔巴尼亚代表登台发言，支持中国代表团的立场，谴责苏联修正主义者的卑鄙行径。这时，苏联修正主义者指挥其娄罗以要发言为借口，竟上台推撞阿尔巴尼亚代表。当中国代表团上前阻止他们这种法西斯行为时，苏联修正主义者及会议的东道主保加利亚工会领导人将事先隐蔽在会场里的彪形大汉放出来冲撞中国和阿尔巴尼亚代表，并把阿尔巴尼亚代表推下讲台。
    苏联修正主义者蓄意制造的反华事件激起了许多国家代表的强烈反对，他们先后发表声明，谴责剥夺中国代表团参加会议权利的荒谬决定。
    苏联修正主义者不顾许多代表团的反对，开动表决机器，以所谓“多数”强行通过了剥夺中国代表团出席会议的权利的决定。
    在表决时，印度尼西亚、锡兰、越南民主共和国、越南南方解放工会联合会、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、罗马尼亚、古巴、日本等代表团投了反对票，委内瑞拉等不少代表团没有参加投票。
    在表决后，中国代表团立即发表声明，指出，苏联修正主义者操纵会议、非法剥夺中国代表团出席会议的权利，是一个严重的反华政治事件，是他们在分裂国际工会运动的道路上迈出的新的严重的一步，他们必须承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。声明指出，中国工会派遣什么人来出席会议，是它的内部事务，是任何人也无权干涉的。声明还着重指出，这个反华决定中的所谓中国工会“情况不明”，是对伟大的中国工人阶级的恶毒挑衅，是中国工人决不能容忍的。
    苏联修正主义者在这次会议上制造的反华事件，完全是有组织、有计划进行的。在会议开幕前举行的执委会上，有些人在苏联修正主义者的指挥下，就一再叫嚷要“净化工联的气氛”，要对中国代表团“采取组织措施”。在会议开幕后，会议执行主席用卑劣手段一再阻止中国代表发言。七日晚上，在苏联修正主义者指挥下，会议东道国保加利亚的工会主席跑到中国代表团住处，对中国代表施加压力，妄图要中国代表放弃反对帝国主义和修正主义的严正立场，遭到中国代表的严厉斥责。
    中国工会代表团负责人，在九日还就苏联修正主义者制造的反华事件向新华社驻索非亚记者发表谈话，指出，会议非法剥夺中国代表团出席会议的权利，是苏联工会领导人格里申亲自策划和指挥的，是苏联修正主义领导集团最近掀起的新的反华浪潮的一个组成部分。
    苏联修正主义者策划的这场反华丑剧，彻底暴露了他们假团结、真分裂的丑恶面目。
    中国代表团负责人指出，苏联修正主义者处心积虑制造这一事件，是由于害怕他们的叛卖行径遭到中国代表的揭露，他们像魔鬼害怕太阳一样，害怕毛泽东思想的真理的声音。这是他们极端虚弱的表现。
    中国代表团负责人最后说，“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”，不管苏联修正主义者采取什么恶劣手段，中国工人和工会将坚定不移地在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和反对以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的道路上胜利前进。战无不胜的毛泽东思想一定要更加广泛地在全世界传播。
