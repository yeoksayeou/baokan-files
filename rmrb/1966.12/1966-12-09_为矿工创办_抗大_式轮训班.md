Miners in the coal city of Fushun have established a new form of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works based on the characteristics of coal mine production—"Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" style rotating training classes. These training classes last for one month per session. Miners participating in the training work during the day and live and study together in the evening. This new learning format solves many practical difficulties miners face in their studies, pushing the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among all miners to a new level. It has effectively promoted the revolutionization of miners' thoughts. Workers praise it, saying, "This is truly a great school for studying Mao Zedong Thought!"

To solve the accommodation problem for the training classes, workers in the mining area took the initiative to build over 20,000 square meters of "rammed earth" houses and vacated some excess offices. The entire mining area has held 505 sessions of "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" style rotating training classes, with over 43,000 workers participating in the study.

    为矿工创办“抗大”式轮训班
    煤都抚顺的矿工们，根据煤矿生产的特点，创办了一种活学活用毛主席著作的新形式——“抗大”式轮训班。这种轮训班，每期一个月。参加轮训的矿工，白天劳动，晚上集体住宿，集体学习。这一新的学习形式，解决了矿工们学习中的许多实际困难，把全矿活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了一个新的水平，有力地促进了矿工思想革命化。职工们称赞说，这里真是学习毛泽东思想的大学校！
    为了解决轮训班的宿舍问题，矿区职工自己动手先后盖起了二万多平方米“干打垒”，并腾出了一些多余的办公室。全矿区已举办“抗大”式轮训班五百零五个，先后参加学习的职工有四万三千多人。
