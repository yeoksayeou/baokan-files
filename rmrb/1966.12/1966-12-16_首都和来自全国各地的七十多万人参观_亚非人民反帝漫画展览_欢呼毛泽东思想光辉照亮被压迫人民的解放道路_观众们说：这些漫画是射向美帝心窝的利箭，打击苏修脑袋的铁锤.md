	"Four volumes of heroic writings, a shining star,
	Red sun over five continents and four seas.
	Brothers of Asia and Africa unite tightly,
	Take up arms to make revolution!"

	Red Guards from the capital and revolutionary masses from all over the country, totaling over 700,000 people, have visited the "Anti-Imperialist Cartoon Exhibition of Asian and African Peoples" held in Beijing. After the visit, people are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, praising the fighting spirit of the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa against imperialism and revisionism, and enthusiastically hailing the brilliance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, which illuminates the path to liberation for the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world.

	The exhibition, organized by the Secretariat of the Asian and African Journalists' Association, has achieved great success. Since its opening on November 24, a tide of people has been pouring into the exhibition hall every day, unceasingly. The exhibition, originally scheduled to close today, has been extended for another week at the request of the masses.

	Visitors have written numerous messages on the comment cards, some expressing enthusiastic praise, some writing impromptu poems, and others sketching drawings. They said they felt the boundless love of the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa for our great leader Chairman Mao from the works provided by revolutionary cartoonists from more than 20 countries and regions in Asia and Africa. They saw the heroic spirit of the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa in defying imperialism, defying revisionism, and defying all reactionaries. They said, "This is a revolutionary exhibition," "The exhibition shows the powerful unity and struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa," "Each cartoon here is like an arrow, piercing the heart of American imperialism; it is also like a heavy hammer, striking the heads of Soviet revisionists." Many visitors wrote in unison: "This exhibition has greatly dispelled the arrogance of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism and greatly boosted the morale of revolutionary peoples around the world," "It is truly excellent, excellent."

	Visitors talked about how the works praising our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, and the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, made them feel particularly close. People stood and looked again and again at the paintings "Mao Zedong Thought is the Red Sun in the Hearts of the World's Peoples," "The East Is Red," and "Invincible Weapon of Thought," unwilling to leave. A group of students from Guizhou had just been inspected by Chairman Mao, and they visited the "Anti-Imperialist Cartoon Exhibition of Asian and African Peoples" with great joy before leaving Beijing. A student wrote on the comment card: "This is a living classroom for the peoples of Asia and Africa to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The entire exhibition shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. The peoples of Asia and Africa and the peoples of the world will unite under the great red banner of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, fight bravely, and then the world will surely belong to the people, and all devils will be destroyed!" A student from Xingtai, Hebei, wrote: "This cartoon exhibition is a concrete manifestation of Mao Zedong Thought taking root, sprouting, blooming, and bearing fruit in the hearts of the world's peoples." Many people also wrote: "The peoples of Asia and Africa look towards Beijing. The great thought of Mao Zedong is not only a magic weapon for the revolution of the Chinese people, but also the best weapon for the struggle of the world's peoples for liberation. Our Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people, but also the great leader of the peoples of the world."

	The broad masses of revolutionary cartoonists and journalists in Asia and Africa stand with the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa, using their pens as weapons, and with sharp pen points, powerfully expose on paper the hollow nature of imperialism and reactionaries in various countries, and enthusiastically praise the great victories of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa. Visitors pointed out that these works reflect the "anti-imperialist storm" of the peoples of Asia and Africa, play a "revolutionary battle song," and record the "footsteps of the peoples of Asia and Africa advancing to victory." It once again proves that Chairman Mao's statements about "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind" and "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" are unshakable truths and spiritual atomic bombs for revolutionary peoples to defeat all enemies.

	Works reflecting the heroic Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation received particularly enthusiastic welcome from the visitors. People denounced the mad aggression of U.S. imperialism and its "peace talk" tricks during the visit; enthusiastically hailed the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese military and people using people's war. Many people wrote in their comments, "The Chinese people will definitely be the backbone of the Vietnamese people," some wrote: "U.S. imperialism will surely fail, the Vietnamese people will surely win," "U.S. aggressors will surely drown in the vast ocean of the Vietnamese people's war, this is their inevitable fate," "We salute the heroic Vietnamese people."

	Revolutionary cartoonists also vividly depicted the ugly faces of Soviet modern revisionists with their sharp brushes. People sneered at and hated those who colluded with the U.S. imperialists, betrayed the interests of the world's revolutionary peoples, and peddled the "peace talk" scam on the Vietnam issue. Some wrote on the comment cards: "Pinching the heads of Soviet revisionist leaders in the cartoons is excellent, let those harmful creatures cry and tremble!" Students from the Baotou Iron and Steel School in Inner Mongolia wrote in their comments: "Soviet revisionists are genuine running dogs of the United States. We must remember: anti-imperialism must be anti-revisionism."

	Visitors, especially the Red Guards, were particularly excited about the exhibition of works reflecting China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. A Red Guard from Shenyang said: "This exhibition hall radiates the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. The image of us Red Guards has been quickly understood and praised by revolutionary artists from various countries, and I am greatly inspired." People also expressed that they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, so as to better support the liberation struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

	The broad masses of revolutionary people in China are very concerned about this exhibition. Some people, after seeing the opening news in the newspapers, sent letters from Nanjing, Tianjin, Haikou in Hainan Island, and other places to the Secretariat of the Asian and African Journalists' Association, which organized the exhibition, to express their congratulations, pay their respects to the revolutionary cartoonists and journalists in Asia and Africa, and wish them, under the brilliant guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, to use their pens as weapons to make greater contributions to the unity and struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa against imperialism and revisionism.

    首都和来自全国各地的七十多万人参观“亚非人民反帝漫画展览”
    欢呼毛泽东思想光辉照亮被压迫人民的解放道路
    观众们说：这些漫画是射向美帝心窝的利箭，打击苏修脑袋的铁锤
    新华社十五日讯　“雄文四卷启明星，五洲四海太阳红。亚非兄弟团结紧，拿起枪杆闹革命！”首都和来自全国各地的红卫兵小将和广大革命群众，总共七十多万人，已经参观了在北京举行的“亚非人民反帝漫画展览”。人们在参观后满怀革命豪情，赞扬亚非革命人民反帝反修的战斗精神，热烈欢呼伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮了亚洲、非洲和全世界一切被压迫人民争取解放的道路。
    由亚非新闻工作者协会书记处举办的这个漫画展览，已经取得了极大的成功。展览从十一月二十四日开幕以来，每天涌入展览馆参观的人流，似潮水一般，络绎不绝。这个展览原定在今天闭幕，现在根据广大群众的要求，决定展出延长一周。
    观众们纷纷在留言笺上题词，有的写下热情的赞语，有的即兴写诗，有的挥笔作画。他们说，他们从亚非二十多个国家和地区的革命的漫画工作者提供的作品中，感受到了亚非革命人民对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，看到了亚非革命人民蔑视帝国主义、蔑视修正主义、蔑视一切反动派的英雄气概。他们说，这是一个“革命的展览会”，“展览显示了亚非人民团结战斗的强大力量”，“这里的一幅幅漫画像利箭，一支支射向美帝国主义的心窝；又像沉重的铁锤，一锤锤砸在苏联修正主义者的头上”。许多观众不约而同地写道：“这个展览大灭了美帝苏修的威风，大长了全世界革命人民的志气”，“真是好得很，好极了。”
    观众们谈到，展出的歌颂我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席，和歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想的作品，大家感到特别亲切。人们在《毛泽东思想是世界人民心中的红太阳》、《东方红》、《战无不胜的思想武器》这些画前，看了又看，不愿离去。一队贵州学生刚刚接受了毛主席的检阅，他们带着无限高兴的心情，在离京前参观了“亚非人民反帝漫画展览”。有一位同学在留言笺上写道：“这是一个亚非人民活学活用毛主席著作的生动课堂，整个展览会闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。亚非人民和全世界人民在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下团结起来，英勇奋斗，那末，世界一定是属于人民的，一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭！”来自河北邢台的一位学生写道：“这一漫画展览，是毛泽东思想在世界人民心中生根、发芽、开花、结果的具体体现。”许多人还这样写道：“亚非革命人民心向着北京。伟大的毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民革命的法宝，而且是世界人民争取解放斗争的最好武器。我们的毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是全世界人民的伟大领袖。”
    广大的亚非革命漫画工作者和新闻工作者，同亚非革命人民站在一起，把笔作为武器，以锐利的笔锋，在画纸上有力地揭露了帝国主义和各国反动派外强中干的本质，热情地歌颂了亚非人民革命斗争的伟大胜利。观众们指出，这些作品反映了亚非人民的“反帝风暴”，奏出了一曲“革命的战歌”，记下了“亚非人民胜利前进的脚步声”。它再一次证明了毛主席关于“东风压倒西风”、“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论断，是颠扑不破的真理，是革命人民用以战胜一切敌人的精神原子弹。
    反映英雄的越南人民抗美救国战争的作品，受到了观众们十分热烈的欢迎。人们在参观中痛斥美帝国主义的疯狂侵略和它玩弄的“和谈”伎俩；热烈欢呼越南军民运用人民战争所取得的光辉胜利。许多人在留言中表示，“中国人民誓做越南人民的后盾”，有的写道：“美帝必败，越南人民必胜”，“美国侵略者必将淹没在越南人民战争的汪洋大海中，这是它不可逃脱的命运”，“我们向英雄的越南人民致敬”。
    革命的漫画工作者还用他们犀利的画笔，淋漓尽致地勾画了苏联现代修正主义者的丑恶嘴脸。人们对那班同美帝穿一条连裆裤、出卖世界革命人民利益、在越南问题上兜售“和谈”骗局的工贼和叛徒，嗤之以鼻，十分憎恶。有的在留言笺上写道：“把苏联修正主义头目‘揪’在漫画上，好得很，让那一班害人虫哭泣吧，发抖吧！”来自内蒙古包头钢铁学校的学生在留言中说：“苏联修正主义者是一个地地道道的美国帮凶。我们一定要牢记：反帝必须反修。”
    观众们特别是红卫兵小将们，对于展览会展出反映我国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵革命行动的作品，感到十分兴奋。一位来自沈阳的红卫兵说：“这个展览馆放射着毛泽东思想的光芒。我们红卫兵的形象很快被各国革命艺术家所理解，所赞扬，我受到无限鼓舞。”人们还纷纷表示，他们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，以便更好地支援世界革命人民的解放斗争。
    我国广大革命群众十分关心这个展览会，有些人从报纸上看到开幕消息以后，从南京、天津、海南岛的海口等地寄信来，向举办这个展览的亚非新闻工作者协会书记处表示祝贺，向亚非革命的漫画工作者和新闻工作者致以敬意，祝他们在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，把画笔作为武器，为亚非人民战斗团结和反帝、反修斗争，做出更大的贡献。
