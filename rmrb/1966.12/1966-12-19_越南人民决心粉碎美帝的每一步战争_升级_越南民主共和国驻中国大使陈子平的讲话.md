Various organizations, people's groups, and Red Guards in China held a grand rally to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. We express our heartfelt thanks for this. We salute our comrades and friends, and through you, we salute the seven hundred million people of brotherly China with a resolve to defeat the U.S. aggressors. At the same time, as the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is approaching, I extend my warmest congratulations and anti-U.S. salvation greetings to Mr. Nguyen Minh Phuong, Deputy Head of the Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and to all members of the delegation, and through you, to the fourteen million compatriots in the South.

Over the past six years, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has implemented a correct line and achieved great victories: it has led the people of South Vietnam to smash the various military and political plans of the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, established a vast liberated area covering four-fifths of the land and a population of ten million, carried out democratic reforms in the liberated areas, distributed land to the peasants, and gradually developed cultural and educational undertakings. Internationally, the number of countries recognizing the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and establishing formal relations with it is increasing. Recently, the establishment of the permanent delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in North Vietnam marks a further enhancement of the prestige of the National Liberation Front, which is in line with the wishes of the people of South and North Vietnam. Despite the deliberate non-recognition and distortion by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the facts show that the prestige of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is growing both domestically and internationally. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the sole legitimate representative of the fourteen million people of South Vietnam and has the power to resolve all issues concerning the future of the people of South Vietnam.

After suffering heavy defeats in the "special war," U.S. imperialism has continuously sent more than forty thousand U.S. troops and mercenaries, along with more than fifty thousand puppet troops, to directly wage a war of aggression in Vietnam. However, over the past year, they have suffered even more severe defeats and have been forced to take a passive stance under the relentless attacks of the military and people of South Vietnam. Whether it is U.S. troops, mercenaries, or puppet troops, they have been beaten and routed everywhere, falling deeper and deeper into the encirclement of the invincible people's war. The organization and prestige of the National Liberation Front have been further consolidated and enhanced in the countryside, and have also made significant progress in the cities, causing the puppet regime to further disintegrate and become unmanageable.

To extricate itself from its predicament in South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has launched a war of destruction against North Vietnam, using its navy and air force to bomb densely populated areas and peaceful villages in North Vietnam. More seriously, in recent days, U.S. imperialism has continuously sent aircraft to bomb the capital city of Hanoi and its suburbs, causing many casualties and destroying many buildings, committing another heinous crime against the Vietnamese people. This is a serious new "escalation" of the war by U.S. imperialism, a blatant provocation against all socialist countries, nationalist countries, and all peace-loving people around the world.

U.S. imperialism thinks that by bombing the capital Hanoi, it can shake the resolve of the Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and force them to surrender, thus saving the inevitable defeat of the U.S. expeditionary forces in South Vietnam.

But U.S. imperialism is gravely mistaken!

The heroic Vietnamese people are fearless; they know only struggle and victory. The more the U.S. aggressors escalate the war, the more they arouse the hatred of the Vietnamese people, who will more resolutely fight back with tenfold, even hundredfold, strength to annihilate the aggressors. The blood debt must be repaid in blood. Johnson and his accomplices, let us tell you, your crimes against the Vietnamese people are well-documented, and your recent crimes in the capital Hanoi are known to all. You cannot deny them. The Vietnamese people will punish you, and the world's people will condemn you.

The people of the North have made a vow: no matter how fierce the war, they will fulfill their duty as the rear base, fight and produce steadfastly to support everything needed by their compatriots in the South. The people of Hanoi have fought well and accurately, giving the U.S. aggressors the punishment they deserve; in the battles of December 13 and 14, 1966, they shot down twelve U.S. aircraft, captured many U.S. air pirates, and foiled their bandit-like attacks, bringing the total number of U.S. aircraft shot down in the North to over 1,600, with more than a hundred U.S. air pirates captured.

Bombing the capital Hanoi is an affront to the entire Vietnamese nation. The military and people of the South are even more determined to strike back at the enemy with even greater ferocity, avenging their compatriots in the North.

U.S. imperialism's bombing of the capital Hanoi does not show its strength but rather its desperation, like a wild beast making its final, frenzied struggles. The Vietnamese people are more confident than ever in their just cause of victory, resolutely implementing Chairman Hu's call of July 17, 1966, to fight tenaciously, endure hardships and sacrifices, and resolve to carry the struggle against U.S. aggression to complete victory. The declaration of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 14, 1966, once again embodies this iron will to fight to the end. This is the appropriate and powerful response to U.S. imperialism's new "escalation."

Comrades and friends:

The struggle of the entire Vietnamese people from North to South against U.S. imperialist aggression is not only to defend their own nation's sacred independence and freedom but also to defend peace in Asia and the world. U.S. imperialism's new war "escalation" further exposes its extremely reactionary, aggressive, and warlike nature, more than ever revealing that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys' so-called "peace talks" are nothing but a cunning deception, making the people of the world, including the American people, even more indignant and united with the Vietnamese people, strongly condemning the aggressive and war policies of the Johnson administration.

The Vietnamese people and the Chinese people have a traditional friendship of mutual dependence and shared fate. The Vietnamese people have always received immense and invaluable sympathy and support from the brotherly Chinese people. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have consistently and fully supported the just stance of the Vietnamese people and, in accordance with the requests of the Vietnamese people, provided all necessary assistance to help them defeat the U.S. aggressors. On December 15, 1966, the Government of the People's Republic of China issued another statement; now, in many places in China, the brotherly Chinese people are holding rallies to severely condemn U.S. imperialism's new war "escalation." The seven hundred million people of China, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, and are ready to make the greatest national sacrifices to support the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people are very proud to have the Chinese people as a sincere friend and close brother.

The Vietnamese people are delighted with the achievements of the Chinese people and believe that these victories have strengthened our vast rear base and increased our fighting strength. The Vietnamese people express their deep gratitude to the Communist Party of China led by the respected Chairman Mao, to the Government of the People's Republic of China, and to the brotherly Chinese people. The Vietnamese people wish the brotherly Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and under the radiant guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, greater achievements in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The people of South and North Vietnam, with unshakable resolve, and with the support of the Chinese people, the people of socialist countries, and the peace-loving people of the world, will smash every step of U.S. imperialism's war "escalation," smash its second dry-season offensive plan, fight to the end, and achieve complete victory. The Vietnamese people are confident that we will overcome all difficulties and achieve brilliant success in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The Vietnamese people will win!

U.S. imperialism will be defeated!

Long live the fighting friendship between the Vietnamese people and the Chinese people!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the Labor Party of Vietnam!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live Chairman Hu!

    越南人民决心粉碎美帝的每一步战争“升级”
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使陈子平的讲话
    中国各组织、各人民团体和红卫兵举行了这一盛大的集会，来支持正在进行抗美救国斗争的越南南、北两方人民，我们对此表示衷心的感谢。我们向同志们、朋友们，并通过你们向兄弟的七亿中国人民致以决心战胜美国侵略强盗的敬礼。同时，在越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年纪念日即将到来的时候，我也向越南南方民族解放阵线代表团代理团长阮明芳先生以及代表团全体成员，并通过你们向一千四百万南方骨肉同胞致以最热烈的祝贺，致以抗美救国的敬礼。
    六年来，越南南方民族解放阵线执行了正确的路线，取得了伟大的胜利：领导越南南方人民粉碎了美国侵略者和卖国走狗的各种军事、政治计划，建立了拥有五分之四面积的土地和一千万人口的广大解放区，在解放区进行了民主改革，把土地分给农民，并逐步发展文化教育事业。在国际上，承认越南南方民族解放阵线并同它建立正式关系的国家越来越多。最近，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团的设立，标志着民族解放阵线的威望得到了进一步的提高，这是符合越南南方和北方人民的愿望的。尽管美帝国主义及其走狗故意不承认并竭力加以歪曲，但是事实表明，越南南方民族解放阵线在国内外的声望日益扩大。越南南方民族解放阵线是一千四百万越南南方人民唯一的真正的代表，拥有解决有关越南南方人民前途的一切问题的全部权力。
    美帝国主义在“特种战争”中遭到惨重失败后，连续地派遣了四十多万美军和仆从军，同五十多万伪军一起，直接在越南进行侵略战争。但是一年多来，他们遭到了更加惨重的失败，在越南南方军民日益猛烈的连续攻击下，他们只能被动挨打。无论是美军，仆从军，还是伪军，到处都被打得丢盔弃甲，越来越深地陷入战无不胜的人民战争的重重包围之中。民族解放阵线的组织和威信在农村更加巩固和提高，在城市也有了很大的发展，使卖国的傀儡政权进一步陷入土崩瓦解，无法收拾的境地。
    美帝国主义为了摆脱它在越南南方的困境，对越南北方进行破坏性战争，使用海、空军对越南北方人口稠密的地区和和平的村庄进行了狂轰滥炸。更为严重的是，最近几天来，美帝国主义连续地派遣飞机轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市区和郊区，使许多居民遭到伤亡，许多房屋遭到破坏，对越南人民又犯下了滔天的罪行。这是美帝国主义极其严重的新的战争
  “升级”，是对各社会主义国家、各民族主义国家以及全世界一切爱好和平人民的横蛮挑衅。
    美帝国主义以为轰炸首都河内，就可以用炸弹来动摇越南人民抗美救国的决心，迫使越南人民屈膝投降，就可以挽救美国远征军在越南南方不可避免的败局。
    但是，美帝国主义是大错特错了！
    英雄的越南人民是无所畏惧的，他们知道的只有战斗和胜利。美国强盗越是使战争“升级”，就越激起越南人民的仇恨，更坚决地以五倍、十倍的力量来消灭侵略者，血债必须用血来还。约翰逊及其同伙们，告诉你们，你们杀害越南人民的罪证如山，你们最近在首都河内犯下的罪行是人所共知的，你们是抵赖不了的。越南人民将惩罚你们，世界人民将谴责你们。
    北方人民已经发出了誓言，不论战争如何酷烈，也要履行自己作为大后方的义务，坚定地进行战斗和生产，来支援南方骨肉同胞所需要的一切。首都河内军民打得好，打得准，给了美国侵略者应得的惩罚；在一九六六年十二月十三日，十四日的两次战斗中，把十二架美国飞机打得粉身碎骨，活捉了许多美国飞贼，粉碎了它们的强盗式的进攻，使在北方被击落的美国飞机总数达到一千六百多架，上百名美国飞贼被活捉。
    侵犯全国的心脏首都河内，就是触犯了整个越南民族的感情。南方军民更加愤怒地坚决给敌人以更沉痛的打击，为北方同胞报仇。
    美帝国主义轰炸首都河内，并不表示它的强大，而表示它正处于穷途末路，像野兽一样正在疯狂地进行垂死的挣扎。越南人民对于自己必胜的正义事业更加充满信心，坚决实现胡主席一九六六年七月十七日的号召，顽强战斗，不怕艰苦牺牲，决心把抗美救国斗争进行到彻底胜利。一九六六年十二月十四日越南民主共和国政府的声明，再一次体现了这种决战决胜的钢铁般的意志。这正是对美帝国主义新的“升级”应有的有力回答。
    同志们，朋友们：
    从北到南的全体越南人民为反对美帝国主义的侵略而进行的斗争，不仅是为了保卫自己民族的神圣独立和自由，而且是为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平。美帝国主义新的战争“升级”，更加暴露了它们的极其反动的侵略和好战面目，比任何时候都更加暴露了美帝国主义及其走狗的所谓“和谈”，只是一种狡诈的骗局，使包括美国人民在内的全世界人民更加愤慨，更加和越南人民团结在一起，强烈地谴责约翰逊政府的侵略政策和战争政策。
    越南人民和中国人民，有着唇齿相依、生死与共的传统友谊。越南人民一贯得到兄弟的中国人民极其巨大的、无比珍贵的同情和支持。中国共产党和中国政府始终如一地完全支持越南人民的正义立场，并且根据越南人民的要求，向越南人民提供了一切必要的援助，以战胜美国侵略强盗。一九六六年十二月十五日中华人民共和国政府再次发表声明；现在，在中国许多地方，兄弟的中国人民都举行集会严厉谴责美帝国主义新的战争
  “升级”。高举毛泽东思想红旗的七亿中国人民，坚决执行林彪同志的指示，不惜作出最大的民族牺牲来支援越南人民。越南人民为有中国人民这样一个真诚的朋友、亲密的兄弟而感到非常自豪。
    越南人民对中国人民所取得的成就感到十分欢欣鼓舞，并且认为这些胜利巩固了我们的辽阔的大后方，给我们增强了战斗力。越南人民谨向以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党、向中华人民共和国政府和兄弟的中国人民致以深切的谢意。越南人民祝兄弟的中国人民，在中国共产党的领导下，在马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，在目前正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命中，取得更大的成就。
    越南南、北两方人民，有坚定不移的决心，有中国人民、社会主义各国人民和世界爱好和平人民的支援，必将粉碎美帝国主义的每一步战争“升级”，粉碎它的第二个旱季攻势计划，坚决打到底，直到取得彻底胜利。越南人民坚信，我们将克服一切艰难困苦，使抗美救国的事业取得辉煌的成功。
    越南人民必胜！
    美帝国主义必败！
    越南人民和中国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    越南劳动党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    胡主席万岁！
