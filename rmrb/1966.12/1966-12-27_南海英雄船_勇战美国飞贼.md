Broadcast of the naming and commendation ceremony for the 1018 cargo ship, awarded the title "South China Hero Ship," held in Guangzhou

New China News Agency, Guangzhou, December 26th -- The Ministry of Communications and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee recently held a naming and commendation ceremony in Guangzhou. The 1018 cargo ship, which bravely fought against American bandit planes while carrying out missions to aid Vietnam and resist the United States, was awarded the glorious title of "South China Hero Ship." The entire crew, who demonstrated great revolutionary courage in this struggle, were commended and rewarded.

Attending the meeting were over 5,000 people, including Red Guards, workers, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary cadres. Responsible officials from Guangdong Province and the Ministry of Communications, as well as responsible officials from the Central-South Bureau of the Communist Party of China and the Guangzhou garrison of the People's Liberation Army, participated in the meeting.

Du Van Minh, Consul General of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Guangzhou, was also invited to attend.

The meeting was filled with boundless love and loyalty for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It demonstrated the Chinese people's firm resolve to aid Vietnam and resist the United States. The meeting began with the solemn melody of "The East Is Red," and the attendees read aloud Chairman Mao's quote: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. It looks as though the reactionaries are all-powerful because they can kill people, burn houses, and destroy things. But in reality, they are paper tigers. As soon as the people's masses are aroused, they reveal their essential weakness and collapse like houses made of rotten wood."

At the meeting, the decision to award the 1018 cargo ship the glorious title of "South China Hero Ship" was announced. Representatives from the Ministry of Communications and Guangdong Province presented the flag to the "South China Hero Ship," and the responsible official from the Guangdong Provincial Maritime Bureau presented the crew with a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and awarded them certificates of merit.

On August 29th of this year, while the 1018 cargo ship was on its way to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it was suddenly attacked by American bandit planes in the normal navigation line of the Gulf of Tonkin. The crew, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in their motherland, focused on politics, united as one, and bravely fought against the enemy planes for three hours. They demonstrated the revolutionary heroism of the Chinese people in daring to struggle and daring to win. After the ship was sunk, the crew, despite their injuries, swam together across the sea and organized resistance on a deserted island. They demonstrated the spirit of class solidarity, hard work, mutual care, and mutual assistance, and finally, with the loving care of the people of their motherland and the great support of the Vietnamese people, they returned to their motherland victorious.

A responsible official from the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, on behalf of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, extended the warmest congratulations to the crew of the "South China Hero Ship." He said: The 1018 cargo ship is a heroic collective of proletarian revolutionaries. The crew's self-sacrificing spirit for socialism and support for the world revolution is a living example of the high internationalism, patriotism, and revolutionary heroism of the Chinese people in the Mao Zedong era. He said, the heroic spirit and revolutionary spirit of the crew of the 1018 ship come from the great Mao Zedong Thought. They have boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. All revolutionary cadres and people in the province should be like the heroes of the 1018 ship, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to the Party, and forever loyal to the people. They should study Chairman Mao's books as revolutionary classics, learn from them in struggle, and apply them in struggle. They should use Mao Zedong's works, especially the "Three Articles," to transform their worldview and become fearless warriors armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought.

A responsible official from the Ministry of Communications spoke at the meeting. He said, the American imperialist military planes brazenly sank and damaged our 1018 and 1019 cargo ships, causing many of our crew members to be killed and injured. This is another serious incident of war provocation by the evil American imperialists against our country, and another blood debt they owe to the Chinese people. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have no illusions about American imperialism and have long been determined to fight to the end with the enemy of the Chinese people and the number one enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism. Chinese sailors will, with their actual actions, transport more materials to Vietnam to support the Vietnamese people in thoroughly defeating American imperialism.

He said, the heroic deeds of the crew of the 1018 ship once again prove that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, most steadfast, most combat-ready, and most capable of overcoming all difficulties, possessing the highest spirit of proletarian unity and camaraderie. Learning from and publicizing the heroic deeds of the 1018 cargo ship has strategic significance for transportation work. The Party Committee of the Ministry of Communications calls on all workers in the national transportation system to seriously learn from the heroic deeds of the crew of the 1018 ship. Learn from their revolutionary heroism in supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, fearlessly facing American imperialism, daring to struggle, and daring to win; learn from their dauntless spirit of overcoming all difficulties and winning victory in any adverse environment; learn from their proletarian high moral character of unity, standing up, shouldering heavy responsibilities, and self-sacrifice in times of extreme danger. In a word, learn from their deep class feelings in studying Chairman Mao's works, learning from them, and applying them in practice, and their boundless love for Chairman Mao, eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, the Party, the people, and the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Du Van Minh, Consul General of Vietnam in Guangzhou, was invited to speak at the meeting. He, on behalf of the Vietnamese Consulate General in Guangzhou and all Vietnamese comrades in Guangzhou, extended warm congratulations to the officers and crew of the "South China Hero Ship." He strongly condemned the continuous war provocations by American imperialism against China. He pointed out that American imperialism attempts to use planes, warships, cannons, tanks, and other weapons to threaten and force the Vietnamese people to surrender, and also attempts to threaten and obstruct the Chinese people's assistance to the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. But they are wrong. The Vietnamese people will resolutely fight to the end until they achieve final victory; the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. The fraternal Vietnamese and Chinese peoples will stand shoulder to shoulder, fight together, and win together forever.

Chen Daying, the captain of the "South China Hero Ship," spoke on behalf of all the crew members at the meeting, expressing their determination to the Party and Chairman Mao. He said, we have the deepest feelings for Mao Zedong Thought and boundless love for it. We will forever be loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, and with the greatest willpower and enthusiasm, we will study, implement, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought. We will resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao to bring the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and study them diligently and seriously. We will take the "Three Articles" as our motto, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, cultivate communist thinking, dedicate ourselves to the revolution, study Chairman Mao's books for life, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and truly implement it in our actions.

Speeches were also made at the meeting by responsible officials from Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City, relevant departments, and the military, as well as representatives of workers and Red Guards.

    越南民主共和国驻广州总领事杜文敏也应邀出席。
    大会始终充满了对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想无限忠诚的感情，表现了中国人民援越抗美的坚强决心。大会在庄严的《东方红》乐曲声中开始后，到会的人齐声朗读毛主席语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    会上，宣读了交通部和广东省人民委员会授予一零一八号货船以“南海英雄船”光荣称号的决定。交通部和广东省的负责人代表交通部和广东省人民委员会向“南海英雄船”授旗，广东省航运厅负责人向英雄船员们赠送了《毛泽东选集》和颁发了立功奖状。
    一零一八号货船于今年八月二十九日驶往越南民主共和国途中，在北部湾正常航行线上突然遭到美国强盗飞机的疯狂袭击。船员们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在祖国无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，突出政治，众志成城，坚守岗位，同敌机进行了长达三个小时的英勇战斗，表现了中国人民敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命英雄气概。船被炸沉以后，船员又带着伤集体游过大海，在荒岛上有组织地坚持斗争，发扬了团结一致，艰苦奋斗，互相关心，互相帮助的阶级友爱精神，终于在祖国人民的亲切关怀和越南人民的大力援助下，胜利回到祖国。
    中共广东省委负责人代表中共广东省委、广东省人民委员会向“南海英雄船”的船员们致以最热烈的祝贺。他说：一零一八号货船是一个无产阶级革命硬骨头的英雄集体。英雄船员们献身社会主义祖国和支援世界革命事业的高尚精神是毛泽东时代的中华儿女高度国际主义、爱国主义和革命英雄主义的一个活典型。他说，一零一八号船员们的英雄气概和革命精神，来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。他们对伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。全省革命干部、革命人民都要像一零一八号的英雄们那样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于党，永远忠于人民。要像他们那样，把毛主席的书当作革命的宝书，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，在用字上狠下功夫。要像他们那样，用毛主席著作特别是用“老三篇”来改造自己的世界观，使自己成为用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的无畏战士。
    交通部负责人在会上讲话，他说，美帝国主义军用飞机悍然炸沉、炸伤我一零一八号和一零一九号货船，使我船员多人牺牲和负伤，这是万恶的美帝国主义对我国进行战争挑衅的又一严重事件，是对中国人民欠下的又一笔血债。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，对美帝国主义没有任何幻想，早已下定决心，誓同中国人民的死敌、全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义斗争到底。中国海员将以自己的实际行动，把更多的物资运到越南去，支援越南人民彻底打败美帝国主义。　
    他说，一零一八号船员们的英雄事迹再次证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最勇敢，最坚定，最有战斗力，最能排除万难，具有最高的无产阶级团结友爱精神。学习和宣传一零一八号货船的英雄事迹，对交通运输工作具有战略意义。交通部党委号召全国交通系统职工坚决地、认真地学习一零一八号船员们的英雄事迹。学习他们为了支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，在美帝国主义面前，不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，敢于斗争的革命英雄气概；学习他们在任何艰难困苦的环境下，充满信心，排除万难，去争取胜利的大无畏精神；学习他们在十分危急的时刻，团结一致，挺身而出，抢挑重担，舍己为人的无产阶级崇高品德。集中到一点，就是学习他们带着深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，学习他们无限热爱毛主席，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民，忠于无产阶级革命事业。
    越南驻广州总领事杜文敏应邀在大会上讲话。他代表越南驻广州总领事馆以及在广州的全体越南同志，向“南海英雄船”的干部和船员表示热烈祝贺。他强烈谴责美帝国主义不断对中国进行战争挑衅。他指出，美帝国主义企图用飞机、军舰、大炮、坦克来威胁和迫使越南人民屈服，而且还企图威胁和阻挡中国人民对越南人民抗美救国斗争的援助。但是它们大错特错了。越南人民要坚决打到底，直到取得最后胜利；用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是任何人也欺负不了的。兄弟般的越中两国人民决心肩并肩，永远战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
      “南海英雄船”指导船长陈大瑛代表全体船员在大会上向党和毛主席表示决心。他说，我们对毛泽东思想有最深厚的感情，无限热爱毛泽东思想。我们永远忠于我们伟大的领袖毛主席，要用最大的毅力，最大的热情来学习毛泽东思想，贯彻毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想。我们坚决响应林彪副主席的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段，认真刻苦地学，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，破私立公，树立一心为公的共产主义思想，干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席的书，把毛泽东思想真正地学到手，真正地掌握起来，真正地落实到行动中去。
    在大会上讲话的，还有广东省、广州市有关方面负责人和部队的负责人，以及工人代表和红卫兵战士。（附图片）
