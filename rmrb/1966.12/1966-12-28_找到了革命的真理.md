	More and more British workers and progressive individuals are finding the truth of revolution in "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung."

	A worker said that many workers in his factory love this "little red book" and have already applied Chairman Mao's quotations in their struggles. He said, "These quotations have answered our questions well!"

	Another British friend, who recently visited China, said he felt very proud to be able to wave the "little red book" together with millions of Chinese youths on Tiananmen Square. The high level of trust between the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people deeply moved him.

	He said, "Why do millions of youths hold up this red book? Because they love their great leader, Chairman Mao!"

	A British youth recently wrote a letter to his Chinese friends, hoping to obtain a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung." He wrote, "I now realize that following the revolutionary line of the Communist Party of China and using armed force can defeat imperialism and its running dogs."

	Recently, this "little red book" has become an important topic among progressive individuals in London. For them, the "little red book" is indeed a precious gift.

    找到了革命的真理
    越来越多的英国劳动群众和进步人士从《毛主席语录》中找到革命的真理。
    有一位工人说，他所在的工厂中许多工人都喜爱这本“红书”，并且已经在斗争中运用了毛主席的语录。他说：“这些语录很好地解答了我们的问题！”
    另一位刚刚访问过中国的英国朋友说，他能在天安门广场上同百万中国青年一起挥动《毛主席语录》感到非常自豪。中国领导人和中国人民之间彼此具有高度的信任，这使他深受感动。
    他说：“为什么百万青年高举这本红书呢？因为他们热爱他们的伟大领袖毛主席！”
    一个英国青年不久前曾写信给中国朋友，希望得到一本《毛主席语录》。他写道：“我现在认识到遵照中国共产党的革命路线，用武装力量才能打败帝国主义及其走狗。”
    最近，这本“红书”已经成为伦敦进步人士的重要话题。“红书”对他们来说，确实是一件珍贵的礼物。
