	Thoughts that contain only the spirit of "public" can fearlessly forge ahead, dedicating everything to liberate all humanity. One can only "charge ahead" and cannot "preserve."

	Foreman Cai Lianxing

	When celebrating the 20th anniversary of the naming of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, we received the highest honor. Comrade Lin Biao inscribed a calligraphy for our locomotive, adding the most glorious page to its history. Facing this new honor, I feel greatly encouraged and inspired; but at the same time, I also feel hesitant and timid. I thought, now our reputation is even greater, and the demands are even higher. How can we preserve this honor? Especially when considering that our locomotive crew's current ideological and work standards, compared to some advanced collectives nationwide, still have a significant gap, I feel the burden is heavy and the pressure is great.

	How should we treat this new honor? With this question in mind, I repeatedly studied the "Three Articles." I opened "Qu Fuxiang Moves Mountains," and a few lines of shining golden words appeared before my eyes: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Chairman Mao's words seemed like the newest directive, making me realize that in my mind, I lack this revolutionary spirit of Qu Fuxiang. Then, I opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune," using Comrade Norman Bethune's selfless dedication and his meticulous pursuit of technical excellence to reflect on myself. I deeply felt that in the face of new honors, the reason I had conservative and timid thoughts was that I had not established a communist worldview like Comrade Norman Bethune.

	Speaking of conservative and timid thoughts, I am not having them for the first time today. In 1964, the Ministry of Railways and the Political Department of the Communist Party of China's Ministry of Railways awarded our locomotive crew a commendation flag, and I also had the idea of "preserving" the honor. Later, with the help of the Party organization, we studied Chairman Mao's works and realized that "preserving" is the theory of stagnation. After removing the idea of "preserving," we continued to charge ahead and make progress. However, at that time, we did not thoroughly root out the conservative and timid thoughts, so once the conditions were right, they resurfaced.

	This time, after studying the "Three Articles," I further realized that the essence of "charging ahead" and "preserving" is the issue of public and private interests. If one's thoughts contain the spirit of "public," one will always think of driving the revolutionary train for 700 million people and for the 3 billion people around the world, and will always have the spirit to charge ahead, fearlessly and bravely, dedicating everything to liberate all humanity. If one's thoughts are dominated by "private" interests, fearing the loss of honor and wanting to "preserve" it, one will be inactive and stagnant. Preserve what? In the end, it is just to preserve one's fame and personal gain. The "self" and "private" are the most dangerous enemies and the greatest hidden dangers.

	Facing this new honor, we have the duty to accelerate and advance bravely, but we do not have the right to stop and stagnate. In the future, I will definitely give the "self" a dead stop and a death sentence, and drive a special express train on the road of ideological revolution.

### 不能“保”

    思想里只有“公”字，才能无所顾忌，勇往直前，为解放全人类献出自己的一切。只能“闯”
  　不能“保”
    司机长　蔡连兴
    在庆祝“毛泽东号”机车命名二十周年的时候，我们得到了最高的奖励。林彪同志为我们机车题词，给机车历史添上了最光荣的一页。在新的荣誉面前，我感到这是对我们最大的鼓舞和鞭策；但同时，也产生了畏难和胆怯的情绪。我想，这下子名声更大了，要求也更高了。怎样才能保住荣誉呢？特别是想到我们包车组现在的思想和工作水平，与全国一些先进集体比较，还有不小的差距，就感到担子很重，压力很大。
    究竟怎样对待新的荣誉？我带着这个问题，反复地学习“老三篇”。我打开《愚公移山》，几行金光闪闪的字闪耀在我的眼前：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的话，好像是最新的指示。使我认识到，在自己头脑里，正是缺少这种革命的愚公精神。接着，我又翻开《纪念白求恩》，用白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人和对待技术精益求精的革命精神对照自己，深深感到自己在新的荣誉面前，所以产生保守和畏难思想，原因就是没有确立白求恩同志那样的共产主义世界观。
    谈起保守、畏难思想，我不是今天才有的。一九六四年，铁道部和中共铁道部政治部授予我们包车组一面奖旗，我也曾产生过“保”荣誉的想法。后来，在党组织的帮助下，我们学习了毛主席著作，才认识到“保”就是停止的论点。去掉了“保”字之后，我们又不断地闯、不断地前进了。但是，当时对保守、畏难思想，没有认真地挖它的老根，所以一旦遇到适当的气候和条件，它又冒了出来。
    这次学习了“老三篇”，我进一步认识到：“闯”和“保”的实质问题，就是公和私的问题。思想里有了“公”字，就会时刻想到为七亿人民开革命列车，为世界上三十亿人民开革命列车，就会永远有一股闯劲，无所顾忌，勇往直前，为解放全人类献出自己的一切。思想里让“私”字占了上风，怕丢了荣誉，想“保”荣誉，就会无所作为，停止不前。保什么呢？说穿了，无非是为了保住自己的名和利。“我”字和“私”字，是最危险的敌人，是最大的事故隐患。
    在新的荣誉面前，我们只有加足马力，奋勇前进的义务，而没有停步不前的权利。今后，我一定要给“我”字撂死闸，判死刑，在思想革命化的道路上开特别快车。
