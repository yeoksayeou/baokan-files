Ningxia Launches Winter Repair Campaign for Agricultural Water Conservancy

According to Xinhua News Agency in Yinchuan, the people of Ningxia are vigorously carrying out a massive winter repair campaign for agricultural water conservancy, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Both the Huanghe River Delta region and the southern part of the Liu Pan Mountains in Ningxia are actively engaged in water conservancy projects. The main focus in the Huanghe River Delta region is to improve the drainage and irrigation conditions of farmlands, while also constructing fields that are resistant to both drought and flooding, ensuring stable and high yields. Currently, more than twenty counties and cities along both banks of the Huanghe River have completed over 200,000 mu (approximately 13,333 hectares) of such fields. In the Liu Pan Mountains, the primary effort is to build small reservoirs and ponds for water storage. Several key projects, including the newly constructed Qing Shi Xia, Shen Jia He, and Hai Zi Xia reservoirs, as well as the heightening of the dams for the Shi Zi Lu and Xian Ma He reservoirs, have all commenced construction.

	This is the water diversion dam at Yangtian in Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, which intercepts the flow of Lian River and directs it into newly opened canals.

    宁夏掀起农田水利冬修运动
    据新华社银川一日电　宁夏各地广大社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起了轰轰烈烈的农田水利冬修运动。
    宁夏黄河河套地区和南部六盘山区现在都在积极兴修水利。河套地区主要是改善农田的排灌条件，同时建设旱涝保收、稳产高产的园田。目前黄河两岸十一个县市建成的园田已达二十多万亩。六盘山区主要是修建小水库、塘坝等蓄水工程。几个重点工程如新修青石峡、沈家河、海子峡等水库工程，和什字路水库、苋麻河水库的大坝加高工程都已开工。（附图片）
