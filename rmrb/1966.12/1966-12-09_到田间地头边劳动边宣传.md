The poor and lower-middle peasants of Six He Big Team, Changtu County, Liaoning Province, were inspired by Comrade Lin Biao's call to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. They selected a group of outstanding individuals from the 187 active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the entire team to form a propaganda team to help everyone study.

The members of this propaganda team carried their production tools with them, worked alongside the masses, and propagated while working. They changed the previous method of studying in the classroom for long periods and lecturing for several hours, adopting a new approach: "The fields are the classroom, study and propagate while working, and discuss thoughts during rest periods." They used the language of the masses to talk about the people and events in front of them, which the masses found particularly enjoyable and familiar.

Once, the propaganda team was preparing to go to the fourth production team for propaganda. Prior to this, they learned that team leader Li Jian was in a bad mood and did not want to be a cadre. The propaganda team discussed this and decided that Party branch secretary Sun Shao Wu, who had previously had similar thoughts to Li Jian, should share his experiences. During a rest period in the fields, Sun Shao Wu first read a passage from "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticisms and corrections." He then shared his own thought transformation process: "In the past, I thought that being a cadre was a disadvantage, with much hard work and many criticisms. I brought this question to my study of White's selfless spirit and Zhang Sided's complete dedication to serving the people. The more I studied, the more guilty I felt. I thought, 'Our ancestors have all been exploited, and I was raised by the Party. Today, I have complaints against the Party and the people. Isn't this forgetting my roots?'"

After hearing this, Li Jian could not sit still any longer. He said with shame, "Sun Shao Wu's words hit the mark. Isn't my problem the lack of a spirit of serving the people?" Afterwards, he sorted out his thoughts and finally put down the burden of not wanting to be a cadre, working actively once again.

    到田间地头边劳动边宣传
    辽宁省昌图县虻牛公社六合大队的贫下中农，听了林彪同志关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的号召，心情振奋。他们从全大队一百八十七名学习毛主席著作积极分子中，推选了一部分尖子，组成了一支活学活用毛主席著作的宣传队，帮助大家学习。
    这支宣传队的队员随身带着生产工具，同群众一起劳动，边劳动边宣传。他们改变了过去在课堂里一学一大篇，一讲几小时的办法，代之以“田间地头是课堂，边干边学边宣传，休息时间来讲用，讲后大家谈思想”的新方式。他们用群众的语言，讲群众眼前的人、眼前的事，群众特别爱听，感到特别亲切。
    有一次，宣传队准备到第四生产队去宣传。事先，他们了解到队长李俭闹情绪，不想当干部。宣传队一研究，认为党支部书记孙绍武过去的思想情况对李俭的号，就决定由孙绍武去讲体会。地头休息时，孙绍武先读了一段《为人民服务》中的话：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”然后又讲自己的思想转变过程：“过去，我认为当干部吃亏，累没少受，还落了一大堆意见。我带着这个问题学习了白求恩毫不利己专门利人的精神和张思德完全、彻底为人民服务的思想，越学心里越有愧。心想家里祖祖辈辈都受剥削，自己是党一手培养起来的，今天反而对党和人民有意见，这不是忘了本？”听他这一说，李俭可坐不住了，惭愧地说：“孙绍武的话打中了我的要害，我不就是缺少为人民服务的思想吗？”以后，他搞通了思想，终于放下了不想当干部的思想包袱，积极工作起来。
