While visiting the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum, Chen Shugui picked up a brand-new wristwatch. He immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and of Norman Bethune, who was selfless and dedicated to others. Although the watch was valuable, the most precious thing was the spirit of selflessness, which is incomparable to any valuable item. With this in mind, he promptly handed the watch over to the museum staff and left without a word. When others asked for his name, he did not respond. Many visitors who witnessed the event commented, "What a noble character!" Upon returning to their accommodation, some classmates eagerly shook hands with Chen Shugui, saying, "Your hands are the cleanest!"

    无私的精神最珍贵
    陈书贵在参观中国人民革命军事博物馆时，拣到一块崭新的手表。他立刻想起毛主席的教导，想起毫不利己专门利人的白求恩。手表虽然珍贵，但最珍贵的还是毫无自私自利之心的精神，这是任何高贵的东西无法比拟的。想到这里，他马上把拾到的手表交给了博物馆的工作同志，回头就走了。别人问他的姓名，他也没有回答。不少参观的人看到了这件事，都说：“风格真高。”一回到住地，有的同学忙着同陈书贵握手，并说：“你的手是最干净的啊！”
