Yunnan Province's first large-scale textile mill, equipped with 60,000 spindles and more than 2,000 looms, has recently been completed in Kunming and has partially started production.

The construction of the Kunming Textile Mill began last year. From the start, the project has adhered to the principle of building a new factory by first cultivating new people, emphasizing the ideological transformation of the workers. Each new worker received a copy of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" upon entering the factory and was organized to study and discuss them, thereby instilling in the new employees a spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. After raising the workers' ideological awareness, they fully demonstrated their enthusiasm and creativity in production. The installation work was completed one quarter ahead of schedule, and the quality fully met the specified standards.

    云南建成一座大型纺织厂
    云南省第一座拥有六万纱锭和两千多台布机的大型纺织厂最近在昆明建成，并已部分地投入生产。
    昆明纺织厂从去年动工兴建起，始终坚持建设新厂首先培养新人的原则，重视职工的思想革命化。新工人一进厂就每人发给一本“老三篇”，组织他们学习讨论，使新职工树立起全心全意为人民服务的思想。职工思想觉悟提高后，充分发挥了生产积极性和创造性，安装工作提前一个季度完成计划，质量完全达到规定标准。
