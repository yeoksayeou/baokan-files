The right-wing military fascist regime in Indonesia is intensifying its political, military, and economic collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. This is a blatant exposure of the ugly face of the Indonesian reactionaries who are aligning with U.S. imperialism and opposing China.

The Chiang Kai-shek bandits are a political zombie preserved by U.S. imperialism, serving as a tool for U.S. imperialism's aggression against China and Asia. The collusion between the Indonesian right-wing military regime and the Chiang bandits only makes it clearer that they are of the same ilk.

It is obvious that the actions of the Indonesian reactionary authorities are directed by Washington. U.S. imperialism is intensifying its policy of hostility and aggression against China, hatching new conspiracies to create "two Chinas," and is hastening to build a military encirclement around China. The Indonesian reactionaries, who have aligned themselves with U.S. imperialism, will inevitably serve as lackeys in U.S. imperialism's anti-China conspiracies.

However, it must be warned that the Indonesian right-wing military regime has already done many bad things to the Chinese people. Now, by colluding with the Chiang bandits to oppose the Chinese people, both the Chinese people and the Indonesian people will not forgive you.

Chairman Mao said: "Those who are completely subservient to U.S. imperialism and follow its lead will ultimately become sacrificial lambs for U.S. imperialism." The Indonesian right-wing military regime, led by the nose by U.S. imperialism, will certainly not end well.

    反华不会有好下场
    印尼右派军人法西斯政权正在加紧同蒋介石匪帮进行政治、军事、经济上的勾结。这是印尼反动派投靠美帝、反对中国的丑恶面目的大暴露。
    蒋介石匪帮是美帝国主义保存的一具政治僵尸，是美帝国主义侵略中国和亚洲的一个工具。印尼右派军人政权同蒋介石勾结一起，只能使人看得更清楚，他们同蒋匪帮是一路货。
    很显然，印尼反动当局的这种做法，是受华盛顿指使的。美帝国主义正在加紧推行敌视和侵略中国的政策，大搞“两个中国”的新阴谋，并且加紧建立对中国的军事包围圈。投靠美帝国主义的印尼反动派，就必然地出来为美帝国主义的反华阴谋效劳。
    但是，必须警告印尼右派军人政权，你们对中国人民所干的坏事已经很不少了，现在你们又同蒋匪帮勾结一起来同中国人民为敌，中国人民和印尼人民都不会饶恕你们的。
    毛主席说：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”被美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的印尼右派军人政权，是决不会有好下场的。
