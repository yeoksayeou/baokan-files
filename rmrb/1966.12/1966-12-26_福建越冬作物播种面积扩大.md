Fujian Province's winter sowing is progressing rapidly and with high quality. The province has already planted 81.5 million mu of winter grains, oilseeds, and green manure crops, with the planting area increased by 40% compared to last year. Among these, the wheat planting area has increased by more than 30% compared to last year.

In the midst of the high tide of the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works, rural areas across the province have turned the winter sowing front into a large classroom for studying and applying the "Three Articles." They are seizing the revolution and promoting production. The broad masses of cadres and community members, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit, farming for the revolution, and planting winter crops with high standards. In many places in Minhou District, some people in the past wanted to engage in more sideline businesses to earn cash and were not willing to expand the winter sowing area. This year, community members studied Chairman Mao's works, carried out class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and criticized capitalist thoughts. The winter sowing area for grains and green manure crops this year has increased compared to last year.

    福建越冬作物播种面积扩大
    福建省冬种进度快，质量好。全省已经种下越冬粮食、油料和绿肥作物八百一十五万亩，播种面积比去年扩大百分之四十。其中，小麦播种面积比去年扩大百分之三十以上。
    在群众性的学习毛主席著作运动的高潮中，各地农村把冬种第一线变成活学活用“老三篇”的大课堂，抓革命，促生产。广大干部社员以毛泽东思想为武器，大破私字，大立公字，为革命种田，用高标准的要求播种越冬作物。闽侯专区的许多地方，以往有些人想多搞点副业赚现钱，不愿扩大冬种面积；今年社员们学习毛主席著作，深入开展阶级斗争和两条道路斗争，批判了资本主义思想，今年的冬种粮食和绿肥作物面积都比去年有所扩大。
