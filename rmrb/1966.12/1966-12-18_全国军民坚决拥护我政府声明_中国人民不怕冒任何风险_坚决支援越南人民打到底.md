The broad masses of people in major cities such as Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenyang, Xi'an, and many provincial capitals, as well as the vast number of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, resolutely support our government's statement issued on the 15th. They vehemently condemn the U.S. imperialists' frenzied bombing of Hanoi and the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, a serious act of war provocation, and unanimously denounce the treacherous behavior of the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique in assisting the U.S. in pushing the "bombing to force peace" plot.

People from various places have held meetings and demonstrations, expressing: If the enemy sharpens their knives, we will also sharpen ours. The U.S. aggression against the Vietnamese people is also an aggression against us. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. The heroic Vietnamese people will not be defeated. The Chinese people are not afraid of taking any risks and are determined to pay any price to stand with the Vietnamese people and contribute everything to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism.

The people of Shanghai, with hearts filled with boundless indignation, strongly condemn the banditry of U.S. imperialism and the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership in serving the U.S. The broad masses of workers and Red Guards today carried red flags, portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, and placards with Chairman Mao's quotations, marching in the rain to demonstrate. They expressed that the people of China and Vietnam are forever brothers who share the same breath and suffer the same hardships. The U.S. and its accomplices, the Soviet revisionists, are escalating the war step by step. We cannot stand idly by. We vow to be the strong backbone of the Vietnamese people, to stand with them forever, and fight to the end until we achieve a complete victory. Wang Chuangen, a model worker and demobilized soldier from the Shanghai Micro-Bearing Factory, said: The more bombs the U.S. imperialists drop, the greater our indignation and the more resolute our fighting spirit. I am ready. As soon as the motherland gives the order, I will immediately return to the front lines. He also said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally led and initiated by Chairman Mao, is the greatest preparation for war. We must follow Chairman Mao's words and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. We must seize the revolution and promote production to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

The broad revolutionary masses and Red Guards in Chengdu sang songs of support for Vietnam and held a grand demonstration. Workers in Chengdu said: The U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi is just the desperate struggle of a paper tiger. The Chinese working class, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, will not just take care of ourselves but will also care about world revolutionary affairs. We are determined to pay any price to support the Vietnamese people to fight to the end!

The broad masses of workers and peasants in Shenyang, as well as revolutionary students, expressed their determination to turn their indignation into strength and support the Vietnamese people with practical actions. Wei Fengying, a model worker in Shenyang and a good worker of Chairman Mao, said: We must treat the factory as a battlefield. Producing one more product is like eliminating one more enemy. Workers from various factories also pointed out sternly: The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are singing in unison, crazily pushing the "bombing to force peace" plot, which shows that they are very weak and are approaching death.

The broad revolutionary masses in Xi'an vehemently condemned the U.S.'s heinous crimes. Over 500 militia representatives attending the Xi'an City Militia Study of Chairman Mao's Works Active Members and Advanced Units Representatives Conference held an indignant denunciation meeting. The representatives collectively expressed their determination: The U.S. imperialists' aggression against our Vietnamese brothers is also an aggression against us. We are Chinese militiamen armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We are not afraid of any sacrifices and will resolutely fight with the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism.

In the city of Fuzhou, on the front line of our country's coastal defense, over 50,000 Red Guards, revolutionary students, militiamen, workers, and cadres held a meeting and marched in the pouring rain today to denounce the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes. People repeatedly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." At the grand denunciation meeting, the Red Guards said, if the Vietnamese people need us, at the motherland's command, we are ready at any time to fight with the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the U.S. invaders.

Over 40,000 people from various circles and Red Guards in Nanning held a grand meeting and demonstration today. A Red Guard representative said at the meeting, we resolutely follow the words of our supreme commander Chairman Mao. If the Vietnamese people need us, at Chairman Mao's command, we will immediately rush to the front lines of supporting Vietnam and resisting the U.S., fighting shoulder to shoulder with our Vietnamese brothers. Vietnamese Consul General Pan Mengjun, invited to speak at the meeting, said, the enthusiastic support of the Communist Party of China, the government of China, the people of China, and the Red Guards is a powerful backbone for our Vietnamese Democratic Republic's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, which is achieving great victories and will ultimately achieve final victory.

In the heroic city of Nanchang, 120,000 revolutionary masses held a meeting and demonstration on the 16th. Workers, revolutionary students, and Red Guard representatives successively spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their complete support for our government's statement and the statement of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic government, vowing to be the strong backbone of the Vietnamese people. The representatives also severely condemned the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership. The meeting also unanimously passed a telegram to Chairman Ho Chi Minh, expressing full support for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

In cities such as Changsha, Hohhot, Lanzhou, and Urumqi, tens of thousands of people from various ethnic groups and revolutionary masses held large-scale meetings and demonstrations, expressing their determination to support the Vietnamese people in driving out all U.S. invaders.

The vast number of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, upon hearing the news of the U.S. continuously bombing Hanoi and brazenly bombing our embassy in Vietnam, were indignant and unanimously expressed their resolute support for our government's solemn statement issued on the 15th, ready to fight alongside our Vietnamese brothers at any time. They said, as soon as our supreme commander Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin give the order, we will immediately rush to the front lines of supporting Vietnam and resisting the U.S., drowning the U.S. paper tiger in the vast ocean of people's war alongside the Vietnamese people. The broad officers and soldiers of the Chengdu troops of the People's Liberation Army expressed their determination to closely monitor the U.S.'s new provocations in Vietnam and to seriously deal with the U.S.'s new "escalation" activities in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. They proposed to carry forward the internationalist spirit of White, the revolutionary heroism of Huang Jiguang, and the fighting style of the heroes of the Tashan Blockade Battle and the "Steel Knife Company" soldiers, supporting the Vietnamese people and demanding blood debt from U.S. imperialism. The naval fleet in Fujian, which had previously sunk and damaged two U.S.-made Kuomintang warships east of Chongwu, unanimously expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's strategic thoughts more diligently, strengthen war preparedness by a hundredfold, and be ready to smash the U.S.'s new war provocations at any time.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions today issued a statement, strongly condemning the U.S.'s heinous crimes, resolutely supporting the Vietnamese Democratic Republic government's solemn stance, and enthusiastically supporting our government's statement issued on December 15th.

The statement strongly condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership's assistance to the U.S. in promoting the "peace talks" deception, accelerating the "escalation" of the war, and aiding the U.S. in its frenzied anti-China actions, attempting to sabotage the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The statement says, Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to defeat the U.S. aggressor invaders is the solemn vow of the 31 million Vietnamese people, a powerful response to U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, the modern revisionists.

The statement concludes that the Chinese workers and people, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, have an unshakable stance of supporting Vietnam and resisting the U.S. All Chinese workers and people will forever be the strong backbone of our Vietnamese brothers, resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people in fighting the war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th, the All-China Women's Federation today issued a statement, most strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' frenzied bombing of Hanoi and the bombing of our embassy in Vietnam, expressing complete support for our government's solemn statement issued on December 15th. The statement also severely condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership's singing in unison with the U.S., actively serving its "bombing to force peace" plot.

The statement says, the Chinese people and women, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, vow to be the strong backbone of the Vietnamese people.
