Chairman Mao said: "Reading books is learning, using them is also learning, and it is even more important learning. Learning warfare from warfare—this is our main method." This principle applies to combat, production, and technological innovation. Anything can be learned as long as one is willing to do it. If one does not do it, one will never learn it; if one never does it, one will never learn it. Thus, I began to think about how to improve my "inserting tiles" work. "Inserting tiles" is a process in the machining of axle bearings. Originally, it was done manually, with a large amount of labor and low efficiency. Inspired by Mao Zedong Thought, I decided to eliminate this manual "inserting tiles" process. I observed carefully and learned humbly. Later, inspired by a type of inserting machine, with the help and support of veteran workers, I created an inserting machine based on the working principle of the inserting machine. The efficiency of this machine was fifteen times higher than manual inserting, freeing us from the labor of manual inserting.

Doing something once increases one's wisdom. Since then, I have made many innovations and revolutions in tools, fixtures, and molds while working and learning. In the process of small improvements and innovations, I found some methods and accumulated some experience. However, to make further innovations and creations, I encountered difficulties. The main obstacle was my lack of knowledge in mechanical principles and technical theories. I had only attended school for a few years and knew nothing about mechanical principles or technical theories. I thought: making major innovations and creations seemed impossible, and my thoughts wavered. Facing a pile of difficulties, I turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. Chairman Mao said: "The distance between 'the common people' and soldiers is not an insurmountable Great Wall, but one that can be quickly eliminated. Doing revolution, doing war, is the method to eliminate this distance." Chairman Mao's words truly enlightened me. Although there is a distance between a worker and an engineering technician in terms of technical theory, it is not an insurmountable Great Wall. As long as one learns from doing, this distance can be eliminated. I seized every spare moment to observe the structure and motion laws of machines carefully during the innovation process. I practiced continuously, exploring the characteristics of various machines. By doing and learning, learning and doing, I gradually mastered the basic principles of mechanics and further discovered some laws of technological innovation and revolution.

Later, relying on the knowledge and experience accumulated from innovations, and the basic technical theories learned from innovations, I completed over four hundred large and small innovations and creations. I also worked with veteran workers and technicians to design and manufacture the first 40-ton pulling lathe and five-hole boring machine, special-purpose boring machine, and seven other large special-purpose equipment in China.

I am an ordinary worker. From operating machines to making machines, everything was learned from doing. From my own experience, I deeply feel that Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," published thirty years ago, not only guided us to achieve great victories in revolutionary wars in the military field but also has immense power in guiding China's socialist revolution and construction. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can change the world and create miracles, ensuring that we are always invincible!

The comrades of the Daqing 1202 Drilling Team are determined to reach the peak of world technology. How can they achieve this? They said well: "We will use Mao Zedong Thought to forge ahead and work hard. Doing creates skills, doing creates wisdom, doing opens paths, doing creates experience, doing creates miracles, doing reaches the peak."

Only under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, by firmly following Chairman Mao's teachings, can we create miracles and reach the peak. This is a truth proven by the revolutionary practice of millions of revolutionary masses.

We must learn Mao Zedong Thought well and use it to guide all our actions. We must act according to Chairman Mao's words. Chairman Mao said: "Reading books is learning, using them is also learning, and it is even more important learning." Only by learning from doing and using, can we learn well and use Mao Zedong Thought to "shoot" at various problems.

Today, this column also publishes two other articles, "Advancing One Step with Each Battle" and "Learning by Doing and Doing by Learning," both of which illustrate this principle.

    边干边学　边学边干
    卢盛和
    毛主席说：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。”打仗是这个道理，搞生产，搞技术革新也是这个道理。天下事，只要肯去干，就能学会的。不干就不会，永远不干就永远不会。于是，我开始从我干的“插瓦”活上打主意。“插瓦”是轴瓦加工的一道工序。原来是手工操作，劳动量比较大，效率却很低。在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，我决心革掉这个手工“插瓦”的命。我细心观察，虚心学习。后来，由于得到一种插床的启发，在老工人的帮助和支持下，仿照插床的工作原理，搞成了一台插瓦机，效率比手工插瓦提高了十五倍，摆脱了手工插瓦的劳动。
    干一回，长一智。打那以后，我边干边学，在工具、卡具和胎具上搞了不少革新和革命。在小改小革过程中摸到了一些门路，积累了一些经验。但是，要想进一步搞大的革新和创造，却又碰到了难题。主要的难关，是一些机械原理和一些技术理论方面的知识。我过去只念过几年书，什么机械原理、技术理论是一窍不通的。我想：搞重大革新创造，算是没门了，思想上有点动摇。面临着一大堆的困难，我又向毛主席著作去请教，毛主席说：“从‘老百姓’到军人之间有一个距离，但不是万里长城，而是可以迅速地消灭的，干革命，干战争，就是消灭这个距离的方法。”毛主席说的话真是开了我的窍。一个工人要达到工程技术人员的技术理论水平，虽然有一个距离，但这不是万里长城，只要从干中学，就能消灭这个距离。平日我抓紧空隙时间，在革新当中专门细心观察机器的结构和各种机器的运动规律，不断地进行实践，摸索各种机械的脾性。边干边学，边学边干，逐渐掌握了机械的基本原理，又进一步摸到了一些搞技术革新、技术革命的规律。
    后来，我靠着革新积累的知识和经验，靠着从革新当中学来的基础技术理论，搞成了四百多项大大小小的革新和创造；还和老工人、技术人员一起，设计制造成功了我国第一台四十吨拉床和五孔镗床、专用镗床等七台大型专用设备。
    我是一个普通工人，从开机器到造机器，都是从干中学会的。我从自己的经历中深深体会到，毛主席在三十年前发表的《中国革命战争的战略问题》这部光辉著作，不但在军事上指导我们取得了革命战争的伟大胜利，而且在指导我国社会主义革命和建设事业中，同样有极其伟大的威力。毛泽东思想是我们各项工作的指导方针，有了毛泽东思想，就能改天换地，创造出人间奇迹，使我们永远立于不败之地！
    大庆一二○二钻井队的同志们立志要攀登世界技术的最高峰，怎样才能做到？他们说得好：“我们就是要用毛泽东思想去闯、去干。干能出本领，干能出智慧，干能闯道路，干能闯经验，干能创奇迹，干能攀高峰。”
    只有在毛泽东思想指导下，坚决按照毛主席的教导，去干革命，干一切工作，才能创造奇迹，才能攀高峰。这是被亿万革命群众的革命实践所证明的真理。
    我们要学好毛泽东思想，要用毛泽东思想指导一切行动，就要按照毛主席的话去办。毛主席说：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”只有在干中学，在用中学，才能学好，才能用毛泽东思想之“矢”，去射各种问题之“的”。
    今天本版发表的另外两篇文章《打一仗进一步》《边干边学边学边干》，都说明了这个道理。
