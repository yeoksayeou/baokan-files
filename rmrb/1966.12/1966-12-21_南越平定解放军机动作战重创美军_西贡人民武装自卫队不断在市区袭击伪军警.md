The Liberation Army in Binh Dinh, South Vietnam, conducted mobile operations on December 17, dealing a heavy blow to a battalion-sized unit of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division.

According to Western news agencies, the battle took place about 60 kilometers northwest of Quy Nhon. Around 10 AM on December 17, a company of U.S. invaders, engaged in a "sweep" operation, fell into an ambush set by the Liberation Army and was met with fierce gunfire. The U.S. aggressors hastily dispatched helicopters to airlift reinforcements. As these helicopters landed, they were again subjected to intense ground fire from the Liberation Army, resulting in the destruction of two helicopters and injuries to their pilots.

In the afternoon, the U.S. forces increased their strength to a battalion level. The Liberation Army, fortified in underground bunkers, bravely fought back, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy before withdrawing under the cover of darkness.

On the morning of December 18, the Liberation Army reappeared about 50 kilometers northwest of Quy Nhon and launched another attack on the disorganized U.S. invaders.

According to a report from the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the armed forces in Saigon and Can Tho in South Vietnam have continued to penetrate enemy strongholds, striking at the enemy with stealth and precision.

On November 26, the People's Self-Defense Force in Saigon launched a sudden and fierce attack on over 100 enemy marines and police between Rue Tay and the Ten Bridges in the city. After a 20-minute battle, the Self-Defense Force killed 20 enemy personnel, captured four, and seized eight weapons.

On December 13, the guerrilla forces in Can Tho used bombs to destroy the "pacification" office across from the puppet government's office, killing and wounding 75 enemy personnel who were attending the closing ceremony of a "pacification cadre training class."

Additionally, the local forces and guerrilla units in Chau Thanh District, Long An Province, intercepted and attacked an enemy patrol boat squadron guarding the Long An Airport on the night of December 9, sinking one landing craft and damaging another, killing seven enemy soldiers and wounding many more.

On the night of November 27, the guerrilla forces in Thanh Hoa Province also damaged three enemy patrol boats on the Dong Nai River.
