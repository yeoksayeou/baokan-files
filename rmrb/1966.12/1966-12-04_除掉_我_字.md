Title: Eradicating the "I"

We have already made a commitment: We must definitely meet the "six completions" (river completion, dike completion, road completion, bridge completion, tree completion, field completion) standard on time. In pursuit of efficiency, I pulled two loads of wet soil onto the river dike. Everyone immediately criticized me. I was a bit resentful at first: "I brought the wet soil for the collective." Comrades asked me to think about Zhang Zide. I immediately took out "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and read it through. My mental block was resolved. I realized that bringing wet soil would not ensure quality, and if there was a big flood, it would be at risk of being washed away. My action did not conform to Chairman Mao's instructions. Measuring my thoughts with the "Three Articles," I found that there were selfish thoughts at work, and I had not fully and thoroughly served the people. Therefore, I mustered my courage and pulled the two loads of wet soil off the dike.

I deeply felt that: Only by using the "Three Articles" to transform my worldview can I truly turn Chairman Mao's call into my actual actions.

    除掉“我”字
    我们已经做了保证：一定要按期达到“六成”（河成、堤成、路成、桥成、树成、田成）标准。为追求工效，我把两车湿土拉到了河堤上。大家立时就向我提出了批评。我乍一听还有点不服气：“我上湿土也是为了集体”。同志们让我想想张思德。我立时拿出《为人民服务》念了一遍，思想疙瘩解开了。认识到上湿土保不住质量，一遇大水就有被冲垮的危险，我这个行动，是不符合毛主席的指示的。用
  “老三篇”的尺子量一量，自己的思想里有私心杂念在作怪，没有做到“完全”“彻底”为人民服务。因此，我鼓足了勇气，又把两车湿土拉下堤来。
    我深深体会到：只有用“老三篇”改造世界观，才能真正把毛主席的号召变成自己的实际行动。
