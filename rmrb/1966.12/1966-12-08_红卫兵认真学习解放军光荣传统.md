Hotly responding to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Red Guards are seriously studying the glorious traditions of the PLA. Revolutionary youngsters have undergone great tempering in politics, ideology, organization, and discipline. They are determined to temper themselves into revolutionaries who meet the requirements of Mao Zedong Thought and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The People's Daily reports: Recently, Red Guards from all over the country who have come to Beijing for joint activities have enthusiastically responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao. In the days they spent with the PLA officers and soldiers who participated in the reception work, they consciously took the PLA as their example, learning from the PLA in every aspect, and have greatly improved and tempered themselves in politics, ideology, organization, and discipline. The revolutionary youngsters excitedly said, "This time coming to Beijing, studying Chairman Mao's works by his side, and learning from the PLA by their side, is a great joy we will never forget in our lifetime." "Living with the PLA this time, we feel warmth in every aspect and are educated in every matter. We truly feel that the PLA is a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, forever worthy of our learning."

Learning from the PLA to study and apply Chairman Mao's works

The Red Guard youngsters understand that the source of the PLA's invincible power is the great Mao Zedong Thought. They learn from the PLA, first of all, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. At a joint evening party between the PLA and the Red Guards, six PLA comrades collectively performed a meaningful item: reciting "In Memory of Norman Bethune" word for word loudly. Hearing them recite so fluently and seeing their meticulous care for their actual actions, the Red Guard youngsters were deeply moved. They decided to catch up. The next day, they seriously studied "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They also seriously applied them, often compared, repeatedly checked, and launched a wave of learning and applying the "Three Articles," with good deeds constantly emerging.

The fifth class of Red Guards living in an accommodation center in Dongcheng District initially read dozens of quotations from Chairman Mao each time they studied, but the actual effect was not obvious. How could they study well? Once, a political instructor from the troops studied with them, picking out a quotation from the collective recitations they had done: "Concern for the Party and the masses is more important than concern for oneself, concern for others is more important than concern for oneself..." He inspired everyone to compare this teaching of Chairman Mao, talking about how they and their classmates had done. Everyone spoke enthusiastically, warmly praising the many good deeds of actively cleaning the toilets and caring for and looking after the sick, and some also voluntarily checked where they had not done enough. The study session was lively and everyone benefited a lot.

In various Red Guard units, PLA officers and soldiers held many study sessions on Chairman Mao's works with the youngsters. The PLA comrades took the lead in exposing their thoughts, with a strong spirit of self-revolution to fight against selfish thoughts, which strongly infected and educated the youngsters. Many Red Guard youngsters also regarded the "self" in their minds as an enemy, daring to "fight hand to hand" and "see the blade." A youngster from the Long March Team of Fengfeng Yonghong Middle School in Hebei once ate a persimmon that had fallen to the ground while passing through a mountainous area. Later, he realized that this violated the "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," but he was afraid that his classmates would look down on him and did not have the courage to speak out. At a study session, the PLA squad leader frankly talked about his thought transformation process of studying the "Three Articles" and fighting against selfish thoughts. He was deeply moved and also voluntarily exposed his thoughts, made a self-criticism, and sent a letter of apology with a small amount of money to the local people. He vowed to be a person who is selfless and dedicated to others.

Many Red Guards took the PLA as their example, insisting on reading Chairman Mao's works every day and studying the "Three Articles" every day. Many good deeds emerged in the Red Guard ranks. Two female students living in the Xianghe Temple Primary School accommodation center in the western suburbs once went out to visit and ran dozens of miles. In the evening, they returned to the vicinity of their accommodation, feeling both hungry and tired. Just at this time, they met an old man asking for directions. This old man was already in his fifties or sixties, carrying several dozen pounds of things, and was still twenty or thirty miles away from his destination. Could they let him walk alone? The teachings of Chairman Mao in "Serve the People" resonated in the ears of the two youngsters; the deeds of the PLA comrades serving the people appeared before their eyes. They asked themselves: If the PLA comrades encountered such a situation, how would they handle it? Yes! They should act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Thus, the two youngsters took the things from the old man, enduring hunger and fatigue, and escorted the old man safely to his destination. When they returned to their accommodation, it was already past nine o'clock in the evening.

Learning from the PLA to be selfless and dedicated to others

During the days the Red Guard youngsters spent with the PLA, they were deeply moved by the spirit of selflessness and dedication to others of the PLA officers and soldiers. As soon as they arrived at the accommodation center, they felt the warmth of the PLA comrades everywhere. When the weather turned cold, the PLA comrades gave their coats and blankets to the students who were dressed lightly. When clothes were torn, the PLA comrades took out needles and thread to mend them. When hair grew long, the PLA comrades gave them haircuts. When someone fell ill, the PLA comrades brought them soup and meals. At night, the Red Guards had already fallen asleep, but the PLA comrades were still studying how to help them with their studies and visits. Many youngsters said excitedly, "We used to talk about learning from Lei Feng, learning from Lei Feng, but this time we have seen a living Lei Feng. We must learn well from these living Lei Fengs."

Many Red Guard youngsters, after studying Chairman Mao's works and being influenced by the PLA comrades, all required themselves to have the spirit of selflessness and dedication to others. Many moving deeds of selflessness and helping others appeared in various accommodation centers. The students from the Long March Team of Chifeng Forestry School in Inner Mongolia brought only one blanket for two people when they came to Beijing. They saw that the southern students in the same room had fewer blankets, so they voluntarily took out three blankets and three quilts to cover the southern students. They said, "When other comrades are warm, our hearts are also warm." Thirteen female students from Wuhan saw that the PLA comrades would rather be a bit cold themselves and let the Red Guards use the bedding and coverings. They were deeply moved and voluntarily took out five blankets to support other students. They said, "Learning from the PLA, we must have actions. The PLA leaves the difficulties to themselves, and we should also send convenience to others."

The Red Guard youngsters liked to listen to the PLA comrades telling battle stories, learning the revolutionary spirit of the PLA soldiers who fearlessly risked their lives for the people's interests. Many youngsters all expressed that they must be fearless like the heroic fighters. The revolutionary youngsters also learned from the PLA comrades about Chairman Mao's teachings on being ruthless to the enemy and harmonious to oneself, and were determined to strengthen unity among comrades. Many accommodation centers became harmonious families. In the Dongdajiao accommodation center, there was a class composed of students from six provinces. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "All members of revolutionary forces must care for each other, love each other, and help each other," saw the example of unity and mutual assistance of the PLA comrades, actively strengthened unity among themselves, eliminated estrangement, and the whole class was united as one.

Learning from the PLA to strictly observe discipline

Many Red Guard youngsters said before leaving Beijing, "This time living with the PLA, we received a non-enlistment army education, lived a non-uniform army life." They listed an important gain, which was strengthening organizational discipline.

Initially, some students had a more scattered style, were not used to collective life, and were not adapted to the relatively strict organizational discipline. The PLA comrades propagated to them Chairman Mao's personally formulated "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" and "Three-Eight Style," and influenced them with their own exemplary actions of strictly observing discipline. The broad Red Guards realized that the PLA was invincible not only because they had a high level of political awareness of self-sacrifice for the people's interests but also because they had strict discipline based on self-awareness. The youngsters all expressed that they would learn from the PLA and temper the Red Guards into a fighting force with high organizational discipline.

The Red Guard youngsters, taking the PLA as their example, did many good deeds of consciously maintaining discipline. A student from Jilin Jiaohe Town Hongqi Agricultural Middle School broke a bowl while eating. He immediately thought of the "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" about "compensating for damaged items," and voluntarily reported the matter to the class leader, went to the street to buy a new bowl, and gave it to the kitchen.

Currently, the Red Guards from various places are bringing the great happiness of being inspected by the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, and are gradually saying goodbye to their good teachers and friends—the PLA comrades—and returning to their battle positions. They are determined to bring back the good traditions and styles of the PLA, apply them in their future battle life, continue to learn from the PLA, temper themselves into proletarian fighters who meet the requirements of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The staff of the reception station of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region, in order to let the Red Guards who came to Beijing for joint activities convey the good news of seeing the great leader Chairman Mao to their classmates and relatives back home, specially sent envelopes, stationery, and stamps to the Red Guards' dormitories for sale, providing great convenience for the youngsters. Many youngsters excitedly said, "The PLA comrades are truly heart to heart with us!"

    热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召
    红卫兵认真学习解放军光荣传统
    广大革命小将在政治上思想上组织上纪律上得到很大锻炼。他们决心把自己锻炼成符合毛泽东思想要求的革命战士，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    本报讯　全国各地最近来京串连的红卫兵，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，在同参加接待工作的解放军干部战士朝夕相处的日子里，自觉地以解放军为榜样，处处向解放军学习，在政治上、思想上、组织上、纪律上得到了很大的锻炼和提高。革命小将们兴奋地说：“这次到北京来，在毛主席身边学习毛主席著作，在解放军身边学习解放军，是我们终生难忘的大喜事。”“这次和解放军生活在一起，处处得温暖，事事受教育，真正体会到解放军是一个毛泽东思想的大学校，永远值得我们学习。”像解放军那样活学活用毛主席著作
    红卫兵小将们懂得，解放军战无不胜的力量源泉，是伟大的毛泽东思想。他们向解放军学习，首先是学习解放军活学活用毛主席著作。在一次解放军和红卫兵的联欢晚会上，有六名解放军同志，集体表演了一个很有意义的节目：一字不漏地大声背诵《为人民服务》。听到他们背诵得那么熟练，再看他们无微不至地关心自己的实际行动，红卫兵小将们感动极了。他们决心迎头赶上。第二天，他们就认真地学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》。他们还认真运用，经常对照，反复检查，掀起了一个学“老三篇”、用“老三篇”的热潮，好人好事不断涌现。
    住在东城区一个接待站里的红卫兵第五班，开始的几天，每次学习都读几十条毛主席语录，读是读了，可是实际效果不明显。怎样才能学得好呢？有一次从部队来的政治指导员和他们一起学习，从他们集体朗读过的语录中，挑出这样一条：“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重……”，启发大家对照毛主席的这一教导，谈谈自己和其他同学做得怎样。大家发言很踊跃，热情地赞扬了主动打扫厕所、关心和照顾病号等大量好人好事，也有人主动检查了自己哪些地方做得不够。学习会开得生动活泼，大家都很有收获。
    在各个红卫兵连里，解放军干部战士和小将们一起，举行过多次学习毛主席著作的讲用会。解放军同志，带头亮思想，狠斗私心杂念的自我革命精神，强烈地感染和教育着小将们。许多红卫兵小将也把头脑里的“私”字当作敌人，勇于“短兵相接”，敢于“刺刀见红”。河北峰峰永红中学长征队的一位小将，路过山区时，曾经在路旁吃了一个掉在地上的柿子。事后，他意识到这是违犯了“三大纪律八项注意”，但是怕同学们瞧不起自己，一直没有勇气讲出来。在一次讲用会上，担任排长的解放军同志，坦率地讲了自己学习“老三篇”，狠斗私心杂念的思想转变过程。他听了很受感动，也主动地亮了思想，作了检查，还给当地群众捎去一角钱，一封道歉的信。他立志要做一个毫不利己专门利人的人。
    许多红卫兵以解放军为榜样，坚持天天读毛主席著作，天天学习“老三篇”。红卫兵队伍中出现了大量好人好事。住在西郊马神庙小学接待站的两位女同学，有一天外出参观，跑了几十里路，傍晚回到住地附近，又饿又累。正在这时候，遇见一位老大爷向她们问路。这位老大爷已经五六十岁了，背着几十斤重的东西，离他要去的地方还有一二十里路。能让他独个儿走吗？毛主席在《为人民服务》中的教导，在两位小将的耳旁震响着；解放军同志为人民服务的事迹，在她们眼前浮现出来。她们反问自己：要是解放军同志遇到这种事情，会怎么处理呢？对！应该像解放军同志那样，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事。于是，两位小将从老大爷手里接过东西，忍着饥饿和劳累，护送老大爷平安地到达了他要去的地方。等她们回到住地的时候，已经是晚上九点多钟了。像解放军那样毫不利己专门利人
    红卫兵小将们和解放军相处的日子里，对于解放军干部战士毫不利己专门利人的精神非常感动。他们一到接待站，就处处感受到解放军同志的温暖。天气冷了，解放军同志把大衣、被子让给衣着单薄的同学。衣服破了，解放军同志拿出针线给他们缝补。头发长了，解放军同志给他们理发。有人病了，解放军同志给端汤送饭。夜里，红卫兵早已入睡，解放军同志还在研究怎样帮助他们学习、参观……。许多小将感动地说：“过去老讲学雷锋，学雷锋，这次可见到活雷锋了。我们一定要向这些活雷锋好好学习。”
    许多红卫兵小将学习了毛主席著作，受到解放军同志的感染，纷纷以毫不利己专门利人的精神要求自己。各个接待站里，出现了许多舍己为人、助人为乐的动人事迹。内蒙古赤峰林业学校长征队的同学，来北京的时候是两个人带一条被子。他们看到同屋住的南方同学带的被子少，就主动拿出三条被子和三条毯子，给南方同学盖。他们说：“别的同学身上暖和了，我们的心里也暖和了。”来自武汉的十三个女同学，看到解放军同志宁肯自己冷一些，把铺的盖的让给红卫兵盖，心里非常感动。她们也主动拿出五条被子，支援别的同学。她们说：“学习解放军，就要有行动。解放军把困难留给自己，我们也要把方便送给别人。”
    红卫兵小将们非常喜欢听解放军同志讲战斗故事，从中学习解放军战士为了人民利益不顾个人安危的革命精神。许多小将都表示，一定要像战斗英雄们那样，作一个无畏的人。革命小将们也从解放军同志那里了解了毛主席教导的对敌要狠，对己要和的道理，决心加强同志之间的团结。许多接待站都成了团结友爱的大家庭。在东大桥接待站里，有一个班是由六个省的学生组成的。他们学习了毛主席关于“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，看到了解放军同志团结互助的榜样，彼此主动加强团结，消除隔阂，全班团结得像一个人一样。像解放军那样严格遵守纪律
    许多红卫兵小将离京以前，满意地说，“这次和解放军生活在一起，受了一次不入伍的部队教育，过了一次不穿军装的部队生活。”他们列举的一项重要收获，是加强了组织性纪律性。
    开始的时候，有的学生作风比较散漫，对集体生活不习惯，对比较严格的组织纪律不适应。解放军同志就向他们宣传毛主席亲手制订的“三大纪律八项注意”和“三八作风”，并且以自己严格遵守纪律的模范行动影响他们。广大红卫兵认识到，人民解放军所以战无不胜，不仅因为他们具有为人民利益勇于自我牺牲的高度政治觉悟，而且因为他们有建立在自觉基础上的严格纪律。小将们纷纷表示，要向解放军学习，把红卫兵锻炼成一支有高度组织性纪律性的战斗队伍。
    红卫兵小将们以解放军为榜样，做了许多自觉维护纪律的好事。吉林蛟河镇红旗农业中学的一个学生，吃饭的时候，打坏了一个碗，立即想起了“三大纪律八项注意”中的“损坏东西要赔”的规定，就主动向班长报告了这件事，上街买了个新碗，还给伙房。
    目前，各地红卫兵正带着接受了伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席检阅的巨大幸福，陆续同自己的良师益友——解放军同志们告别，返回战斗岗位。他们决心把解放军的好传统好作风带回去，运用在今后的战斗生活中。他们决心继续向解放军学习，把自己锻炼成符合毛泽东思想要求的无产阶级战士，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。（附图片）
    解放军某部接待站工作人员，为了让来京串连的红卫兵小将把见到伟大领袖毛主席的喜讯，及时告诉本地的同学和亲人，特意把信封、信纸、邮票送到红卫兵小将宿舍代售，给小将们提供了很大方便。许多小将们兴奋地说：“解放军同志真是和我们心连心！”
