Vietnamese Ambassador to China, Colonel Chen Wenpeng, hosted a banquet tonight to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the Vietnamese People's Army. Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, Xu Xiangqian, attended the banquet.

At the banquet filled with the fighting camaraderie between the peoples and armies of China and Vietnam, Colonel Chen Wenpeng and Acting Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Yang Chengwu, delivered speeches. Colonel Chen Wenpeng emphasized in his speech: The heroic Vietnamese people and their army will never surrender, fear no hardship or sacrifice, and will resolutely defeat the various plots of American imperialism. He said, in the struggle against American imperialism, the Vietnamese army and people are willing to fight side by side forever with the brotherly Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Acting Chief of the General Staff Yang Chengwu stressed in his speech that the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with the invincible and great Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and are determined to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people. Furthermore, they have already made up their minds that as long as the interests of the peoples of China and Vietnam require it, and as long as our great commander gives the order, we will immediately march to the front lines to fight side by side with the brotherly Vietnamese people and army, and together defeat American imperialism until the American aggressors are completely driven out of Vietnam.

Attending the banquet were also senior officials from various departments, branches, and services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including Peng Shaohui, Li Tianyou, Yuan Ziqin, Fu Zhong, Tang Tianji, Chen Shigang, Li Zuopeng, and Wang Huijiu. Also present were Deputy Foreign Minister Han Nianlong and other relevant officials invited to the event.

Ambassador Chen Ziping of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, Secretary Nguyen Thu of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, and ambassadors and military attachés from other countries to China also attended the banquet.

Colonel Chen Wenpeng spoke first at the banquet. He strongly condemned the crimes of American imperialism in escalating the war of aggression against Vietnam and introduced the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese military and people in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. He said that these victories demonstrate a fact: although the American imperialist aggressors are brutal and extremely cunning, they are not to be feared and can be defeated. This also proves a truth: a nation, no matter how small, as long as it has the leadership of a genuine Marxist-Leninist party, achieves great unity among the people, fights to the end, has the correct political line, and an invincible people's war, can definitely defeat the imperialist colonizers, even if it is American imperialism.

Chen Wenpeng said, Vietnam and China are two socialist brother countries that are inseparable. Comrade Lin Biao has said: "We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support the brotherly Vietnamese people in carrying the war of resistance against American aggression to the end." From the very beginning, the Chinese people have been striving to provide strong, continuous, and timely assistance to the military and people of both North and South Vietnam in many ways. At this solemn moment, we express our sincere gratitude to the beloved Chairman Mao, to the glorious Communist Party of China, to the great 700 million Chinese people, and to the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Chen Wenpeng concluded by saying, the Vietnamese People's Army and the Vietnamese people are delighted with the great achievements made by the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in building China into a socialist power with modern industry and agriculture, advanced science and technology, and a modern national defense. They believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the glorious Communist Party of China, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, will achieve even more brilliant successes in politics, economy, military, and culture.

Acting Chief of the General Staff Yang Chengwu, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended the warmest holiday greetings to the comrades of the Vietnamese People's Army fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle. He praised the Vietnamese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese Labor Party, for continuing to write brilliant chapters in the history of their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. He said, the heroic Vietnamese military and people have achieved brilliant victories and created magnificent achievements in the great struggle against American aggression, demonstrating the mighty power of people's war and making extremely important contributions to the anti-American struggle of all oppressed peoples around the world.

He said, our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In human history, any reactionary forces that are about to perish will always make a last struggle against the revolutionary forces." Now, the vicious American imperialism is intensifying its "escalation" on the Vietnamese battlefield, making its last desperate struggles. It is carrying out heavy bombing raids on North Vietnam, even brazenly bombing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and openly firing at our embassy in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It is conducting bloody sweeps against the people of South Vietnam. At the same time, it is colluding with its various lackeys to repeatedly hatch a series of plots to force, entice, and persuade Vietnam to negotiate, attempting to gain at the negotiating table what it cannot gain on the battlefield. However, no matter how frantically American imperialism tries to use its counter-revolutionary tactics, it will never be able to reverse its doomed fate. Those who follow American imperialism and attempt to betray the interests of the Vietnamese people, becoming its lackeys, will also meet a bad end.

He said, Chairman Mao also teaches us: "After crossing the difficult path of war, the road to victory will open up." Now, the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation is at a crucial moment. We firmly believe that the great struggle of the brotherly Vietnamese people to liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify their country will overcome the difficulties and achieve final victory.

Acting Chief of the General Staff Yang Chengwu enthusiastically praised the fighting camaraderie between the peoples and armies of China and Vietnam. He said, we fully support the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 14 and fully endorse the statement of our government on December 15. Not long ago, Vice Chairman Lin Biao solemnly declared: "We have made all the preparations. We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support the brotherly Vietnamese people in carrying the war of resistance against American aggression to the end." The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with the invincible and great Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao and are determined to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people.

    杨成武代总参谋长在越南建军节招待会上重申中国军民的决心
    只要中越人民利益需要，只要毛主席下令我们就立即开赴前线同越南兄弟并肩作战
    陈文彭武官说，越南军民决不屈服，不怕艰苦牺牲，坚决打败美帝
    新华社二十二日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆武官陈文彭上校今晚举行招待会，热烈庆祝越南人民军建军二十二周年。
    人大常委会副委员长、国防委员会副主席徐向前出席了招待会。
    在充满中越两国人民和两国军队战斗友谊的招待会上，陈文彭上校和中国人民解放军代总参谋长杨成武先后讲话。陈文彭武官在讲话中着重指出：英雄的越南人民和人民军决不屈服，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决打败美帝国主义的各种阴谋。他说，在反对美帝国主义的斗争中，越南军队和人民愿同兄弟的中国人民和中国人民解放军永远并肩一起战斗。杨成武代总参谋长在讲话中强调说，用战无不胜的、伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，坚决响应林彪副主席的号召，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾。并且早已下定决心，只要中越两国人民利益的需要，只要我们伟大的统帅一声令下，我们就立即开赴前线，同兄弟的越南人民和军队并肩作战，共同打败美帝国主义，直到美国强盗全部从越南滚出去。
    出席招待会的还有中国人民解放军各总部、军种、兵种负责人彭绍辉、李天佑、袁子钦、傅钟、唐天际、陈士榘、李作鹏、王辉球等。应邀出席的还有外交部副部长韩念龙以及其他有关方面负责人。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使陈子平，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团秘书阮顺和，以及其他各国驻华大使和武官也出席了招待会。
    陈文彭武官在招待会上首先讲话。他强烈谴责美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的罪行，并介绍了越南军民在抗美救国斗争中取得的辉煌胜利。他说，这胜利表明一个事实：美帝国主义侵略者虽然残暴和非常狡猾，但是没有什么可怕的，是可以打败的。这也表明了一条真理：一个民族虽然很小，但只要有真正的马克思列宁主义政党的领导，实现人民的大团结，坚决斗争到底，有正确的政治路线和战无不胜的人民战争，就一定可以战胜帝国主义殖民者，哪怕它是美帝国主义。
    陈文彭说，越南和中国是唇齿相依的两个社会主义兄弟国家。林彪同志说过：“我们决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民把抗美救国的战争进行到底。”从一开始，中国人民就已努力在多方面向越南南北两方军民提供有力的、连续的、及时的援助。在这个隆重的时候，我们向敬爱的毛主席，向光荣的中国共产党、伟大的七亿中国人民和英雄的中国人民解放军表示越南军民的真诚谢意。
    陈文彭最后说，越南人民军和越南人民对中国人民和中国人民解放军在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，在把中国建设成一个拥有现代工农业、先进的科学技术和现代国防的社会主义强国的事业中所取得的巨大成就感到高兴，并且相信，在以毛泽东主席为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下，用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，将在政治、经济、军事和文化等各方面取得更加辉煌的成就。
    杨成武代总参谋长在讲话中代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向战斗在反美斗争最前线的越南人民军全体战友致以最热烈的节日祝贺，并且赞扬越南人民，在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的英明领导下，在抗美救国的斗争史上，继续写下了无数光辉的篇章。他说，英雄的全体越南军民，在伟大的抗美救国斗争中取得了辉煌胜利，创造了丰功伟绩，使人民战争的威力大放异彩，对全世界一切被压迫人民的反美斗争，作出了极其重大的贡献。
    他说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。现在，穷凶极恶的美帝国主义正在越南战场上不断加紧“升级”，正在进行垂死挣扎。它对越南北方加紧狂轰滥炸，甚至悍然连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内，并公然向我国驻越南民主共和国的大使馆开火。它对越南南方人民加紧进行血腥的扫荡。同时，还伙同它的形形色色的帮凶，翻来复去地策动了一系列迫和、诱和、劝和的阴谋，妄图从谈判桌上捞取它在战场上捞不到的东西。但是，不管美帝国主义如何疯狂的施展它反革命的两手，它绝对无法挽回它的失败命运。一切追随美帝国主义，企图出卖越南人民利益、甘当美帝国主义帮凶的人，也决不会有好下场。
    他说，毛主席还教导我们：“跨过战争的艰难路程之后，胜利的坦途就到来了”。现在，越南人民的抗美救国斗争，正处在一个关键性的重要时刻。我们坚信，兄弟的越南人民解放南方、保卫北方、统一自己祖国的伟大斗争，必将跨过艰难路程，赢得最后胜利。
    杨成武代总参谋长热烈赞扬中越两国人民和两国军队之间的战斗友谊。他说，我们完全支持越南民主共和国政府十二月十四日的声明，完全拥护我国政府十二月十五日的声明。不久以前，林彪副主席庄严宣告：“我们已经作好了一切准备。我们决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民把抗美救国的战争进行到底。”用战无不胜的、伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，坚决响应林彪副主席的号召，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾。
