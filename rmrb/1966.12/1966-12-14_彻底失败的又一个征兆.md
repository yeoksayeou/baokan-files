The great victories achieved by the Liberation Army of South Vietnam in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation have had a profound impact on the puppet army in South Vietnam. Some patriotic soldiers in the puppet army, who initially felt war-weariness and deserted, have now developed to the point of refusing to fight, and even turning their guns on American aggressors and puppet military officers. This indicates that the American aggressors and their lackeys are increasingly facing a situation of widespread desertion and betrayal.

The U.S. imperialists have spared no expense in maintaining a large puppet army in South Vietnam, hoping to achieve their aggressive goals through the policy of "Vietnamese fighting Vietnamese." However, most of the soldiers in the puppet army were forcibly conscripted and do not want to fight for the American aggressors. Therefore, this army has low morale and collapses at the first encounter with the enemy. The U.S. aggressor forces are savage and tyrannical, acting arrogantly, which has created sharp contradictions between them and the puppet army. As the armed forces of South Vietnam grow stronger and more victorious in battle, this puppet army will inevitably disintegrate.

Chairman Mao said, "On the side of our enemy, they are so corrupt, so full of increasing internal disputes that cannot be resolved, so hated by the people and isolated, and have suffered so many defeats, that they are bound to head towards destruction." The resistance of South Vietnamese puppet soldiers against the American aggressors is another sign of the imminent failure of the American aggressors.

    彻底失败的又一个征兆
    越南南方解放军在抗美救国斗争中所取得的伟大胜利，在南越伪军中产生了深远的影响。伪军中的一部分爱国士兵，从厌战、逃亡，发展到了拒绝作战，甚至掉转枪口打死美国侵略者和伪军军官。这表明美国侵略者和它的走狗已经越来越陷于众叛亲离的局面。
    美帝国主义在南越不惜工本，豢养了一支庞大的伪军，妄想用“越南人打越南人”的政策来实现自己的侵略目的。但是，伪军的士兵绝大部分是被强征入伍的，他们不愿意替美国侵略者卖命。因此，这支军队士气低落，在战场上一触即溃。美国侵略军野蛮残暴，作威作福，使伪军同他们之间的矛盾非常尖锐。随着南越解放武装力量越战越强，越战越胜，这支傀儡军队就必将土崩瓦解。
    毛主席说，在我们的敌人方面，“他们是那样腐化，那样充满日益增多的无法解决的内部争吵，那样被人民唾弃而陷于完全的孤立，打了那样多的败仗，因此他们就必不可免地走向灭亡。”南越伪军士兵对美国侵略者的反抗，正是美国侵略者必将彻底失败的又一个征兆。
