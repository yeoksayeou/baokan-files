The furnace repair team of the Muling Forestry Bureau in Heilongjiang Province received a batch of urgent tasks. This team consisted of only five people. Due to the heavy workload and tight schedule, they discussed and felt that they lacked manpower and were worried about not being able to complete the tasks on time.

At this moment, the lathe team sent them a quotation from Chairman Mao. The furnace repair team saw that on a large red paper, Chairman Mao's words were written: "The Yangtze River, everyone says it is very big, but actually, big things are not scary. Isn't American imperialism very big? We have stood up to it, and it's nothing. Therefore, some big things in the world are actually not scary."

After reading this quotation, the team members immediately felt a surge of warmth throughout their bodies, gaining boundless courage and strength to overcome difficulties. They excitedly said, "Thank you for your support, comrades." They neatly pasted the quotation sent by the lathe team on the wall and studied it repeatedly. Worker Zhang Shoufou said, "If we are not afraid of American imperialism, what is there to fear? With Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome." Everyone unanimously agreed: Without increasing manpower, they would still complete the tasks ahead of schedule. In the past, five people only operated two furnaces, but now they operated three furnaces, and finally completed the production tasks excellently. Team leader Zhao Wenrui said, "No matter how much support, sending us Chairman Mao's quotations is the greatest support."

    最大的支援
    黑龙江省穆棱林业局检修厂烘炉组接到一批急活。这个组只有五个人，由于任务重，时间紧，大家研究来研究去，总感到人手不够，担心完不成任务。
    正在这时，车工组的同志们给他们送来了一条毛主席语录。烘炉组的同志一看，大红纸上写着毛主席的话：“长江，别人都说很大，其实，大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。所以，世界上有些大的东西，其实并不可怕。”
    同志们念完这条语录，顿时觉得一股热流流遍全身，增添了克服困难的无穷勇气和力量。他们激动地说：“感谢同志们的支援。”他们把车工组送来的语录，工工整整地贴在墙上，又反复学了几遍。工人张寿福说：“连美帝国主义我们都不怕，还怕什么困难。有毛泽东思想武装，就是再大的困难也能踢开。”大家一致表示：不增加人，也要提前完成任务。过去，五个人只开两盘炉，现在开了三盘炉，终于出色地完成了生产任务。组长赵文瑞说：“千支援，万支援，送来毛主席语录，对我们是最大的支援。”
