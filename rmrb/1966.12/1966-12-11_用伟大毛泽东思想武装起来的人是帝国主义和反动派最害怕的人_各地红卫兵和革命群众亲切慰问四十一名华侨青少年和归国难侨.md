	Those armed with great Mao Zedong Thought are the ones imperialism and reactionaries fear the most

	Red Guards and revolutionary masses from various places warmly visit 41 overseas Chinese youth and returned overseas Chinese who faced difficulties

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, December 10th: Red Guards and revolutionary masses from all over the country have sent telegrams and letters to the 41 overseas Chinese youth who are loyal to Chairman Mao and to the motherland, as well as to other returned overseas Chinese who have bravely fought against the Indonesian reactionaries. They express warm regards and high respect, and enthusiastically encourage them to make new contributions to the socialist revolution and construction of the motherland and to the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.

	The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary people pointed out in their telegrams and letters that the glorious victories achieved by the 41 overseas Chinese youth in their struggles prove that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of any threats or violence. Students from the "South Island Long March Team" of Hainan Overseas Chinese Agricultural College wrote in a letter: Your moving and glorious deeds show that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, strongest, and smartest people, and are the ones imperialism and all reactionaries fear the most.

	The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary people also enthusiastically praised the daring spirit of the 41 overseas Chinese youth to fight and win. Medical staff from Tianjin Baiqen Hospital wrote in a letter: Your brave struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries greatly boosts the morale of patriotic overseas Chinese and revolutionary people, and greatly dampens the arrogance of U.S. imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries. You did well, and you did it brilliantly. We are proud and honored for you. A returned overseas Chinese student from the "Long March Red Guards" of Beijing Aviation Institute Affiliated Middle School wrote in a letter: Facing the cruel persecution of class enemies, you remained unperturbed and fearless. No matter what tricks the enemy used, you exposed them mercilessly and smashed them completely. You are truly good soldiers of Chairman Mao and good children of the motherland.

	Many telegrams and letters expressed the desire to learn from the 41 heroic overseas Chinese youth and patriotic overseas Chinese, drawing strength from their struggle. Many people also sent copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and works by Mao Zedong when writing letters, encouraging the returned overseas Chinese youth to continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly remold their worldview with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," and to become good successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Gao Xihua, a third-grade student from Nanfeng Brigade, Anxin County, Hebei Province, is a daughter of a poor peasant. She bought two copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sent them to the returned overseas Chinese, and wrote in her letter: Chairman Mao's book is a revolutionary treasure. It contains the direction of the revolution, the weapon to defeat the enemy, and the method to overcome difficulties. Let us study it diligently together, master it, and contribute everything to building a powerful socialist motherland and supporting the world people's revolution. (With pictures)

    用伟大毛泽东思想武装起来的人是帝国主义和反动派最害怕的人
    各地红卫兵和革命群众亲切慰问四十一名华侨青少年和归国难侨
    据新华社湛江十日电　全国各地红卫兵和革命群众，纷纷给忠于毛主席、忠于祖国的四十一名华侨青少年以及其他曾和印尼反动派进行过英勇斗争的归国难侨们来电来信，向他们表示亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意，热情地鼓励他们今后为祖国社会主义革命和建设以及世界人民的革命事业作出新的贡献。
    广大红卫兵和革命群众，在来电来信中指出，四十一名华侨青少年在斗争中取得辉煌胜利的事实证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是任何威胁、任何暴力也吓不倒的。海南岛华侨农学院“南岛长征队”的学生在信中说：你们可歌可泣的光辉事迹说明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最勇敢、最坚强、最聪明的人，是帝国主义和一切反动派最害怕的人。
    广大红卫兵和革命群众，还热情地赞扬了四十一名华侨青少年敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄气概。天津白求恩医院的医务工作人员来信说：你们同印尼反动派的英勇斗争，大长爱国华侨和革命人民的志气，大灭美帝国主义和印尼反动派的威风。你们干得好，干得漂亮，我们为你们感到骄傲和自豪。北京航空学院附属中学“长征红卫队”一位归侨学生来信说：面对着阶级敌人的残酷迫害，你们面不改色，无所畏惧，无论敌人使出什么鬼花招，都被你们无情地揭露，彻底地粉碎，你们不愧为毛主席的好战士，祖国人民的好儿女。
    许多来电来信表示要向四十一名英雄的华侨青少年和爱国华侨们好好学习，从他们的斗争事迹中吸取前进的力量。不少人在来信时还寄来了一本本《毛主席语录》和毛主席著作，鼓励归国华侨青少年继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神彻底改造世界观，当好无产阶级革命事业的接班人。河北省安新县南冯大队三年级小学生高锡花，是一个贫农的女儿。她买了两本《毛主席语录》寄给归国华侨，并且在来信中说：毛主席的书是革命的宝书，这里有革命的方向，有战胜敌人的武器，有克服困难的办法。让我们共同刻苦地学习它，掌握它，为建设强大的社会主义祖国和支持世界人民革命而贡献一切。（附图片）
