I have come to understand that a person can only be most powerful when united with the collective. ... In the future, whatever I do, I will definitely follow the mass line, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, unite the masses, and together contribute our strength to the construction of socialism and the realization of communism. — Lei Feng

The power of the masses is great. The masses are the true heroes. The millions and millions of people who sincerely support the revolution form an iron wall that cannot be broken or overthrown. Only by mobilizing the masses can we move mountains and fill seas, and change the course of heaven and earth. — Wang Jie

We Communists, in rural work, without the poor and lower-middle peasants, cannot accomplish anything. — Jiao Yulu

The main force of the proletarian revolutionary cause is the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. To smash the reactionary state machine, bury the reactionary social system, and thoroughly eliminate all bourgeois ideology, in short, to destroy the old world and build a new world, we must rely on the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. — Li Suwen

We workers, peasants, and soldiers study Chairman Mao's works, master Mao Zedong Thought, and become the bravest, most intelligent, most powerful, and most knowledgeable people. We can control the objective laws of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. We can change the heavens and the earth, create miracles, defeat any enemy, and overcome any difficulty. — Feng Fusheng

Human potential is immense. As long as we listen to the Party, devote ourselves wholeheartedly to the revolution, use our minds, and exert our strength, the soldiers of Chairman Mao can create any miracle. — Sun Leyi

An individual's abilities are limited, but the wisdom of the masses is boundless. By continuously learning from the masses and consulting with the masses, we can keep moving forward and continuously improve. — Chen Yongkang
