Edition: 3

The heroic fighting collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought—41 overseas Chinese youth in Indonesia's prisons have fought bravely, and their deeds have spread throughout China and the world. The following excerpt from the diary of Yu Yazhou, one of the 41 youth who was arrested before the incident, shows how great Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured the growth of overseas Chinese youth. Yu Yazhou is one of the 41 youth, 20 years old, born into a poor laboring family in Indonesia. Before being illegally arrested by the Indonesian reactionaries, he studied diligently at the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School while working part-time. From his diary, one can see how great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought has given our overseas heroic children tremendous fighting strength.

	May 9, 1966
	Transforming one's thoughts is no easy task! It requires deep reflection and struggle. One must read books, starting with Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" to whip oneself into shape and inspire oneself. The process of transforming one's thoughts is also a painful one. Sometimes, after overcoming errors, incorrect thoughts reappear, and one must go through another struggle to overcome them.

	May 10, 1966
	"China has successfully detonated a nuclear weapon containing thermonuclear materials!" Early in the morning, this exhilarating news spread throughout the entire dormitory (Note: referring to the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School dormitory). Everyone was overjoyed, some laughing uncontrollably, others excitedly raising their fists and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

	I couldn't contain my excitement. I had to go out in the morning, and as soon as I met an acquaintance, I told him the good news. Xiaochen heard it and was so happy she shouted. Looking at her, I thought, if all the students and all the overseas Chinese could hear this news immediately, it would be wonderful!

	Motherland! When we were bullied by the running dogs of imperialism, you gave us a sense of justice; in our most difficult times, you gave us strength. We must strive to be worthy citizens of the People's Republic of China.

	May 16, 1966
	"To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai." Under the guillotine of the reactionaries, at the moment of life and death, facing the threat of death from demons and monsters, remembering Chairman Mao's teaching, one can remain steadfast and unyielding, and fight to the end to maintain the interests of the overseas Chinese and the dignity of the motherland, even at the cost of one's precious life.

	We overseas Chinese, even in times of bayonet threats, must, like the people of the motherland, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, despise all demons and monsters that oppose the people, and resolutely fight them to the end. Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear strong but are actually weak. As long as we fearlessly oppose them, we can definitely defeat them.

	We listened to a broadcast from the motherland's radio station, where a former serf from Tibet denounced anti-party and anti-socialist elements. Listen, her voice is so resolute: "Without the Communist Party, we million Tibetan serfs would not have been liberated; without Chairman Mao, we would not have our happy lives today." Her voice gives us the strength to fight. Although it is still night here, and we are suffering unprecedented difficulties and calamities, in any situation, we must follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to his instructions, to be overseas Chinese who are worthy of our great motherland and its people!

	May 23, 1966
	Whether one dares to despise the enemy, whether one can remain calm under the enemy's guillotine, whether one is willing to sacrifice oneself for the people's interests and the dignity of the motherland, this is the dividing line between true revolutionaries and false ones, the watershed between sincere revolutionaries and traitors.

	The heroic deeds of Zhao Xiaoshou, Huang Mu, and two comrades tell us: we must not have any illusions about the enemy. Chairman Mao said: "All reactionary things, if you do not attack, they will not fall." Chairman Mao also taught us: imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The reactionaries who bully the weak and fear the strong can definitely be overthrown.

	Bullying the weak and fearing the strong is the nature of all reactionaries. The more you fear them, the more you compromise with them, the more they will bully you. As long as we stand tall, hold our heads high, and face them with a stern expression, "frowning at a thousand pointing fingers," and confront them head-on, even under their butcher's knives, we must persist in fighting, fearing neither sacrifice nor bloodshed. We must not say anything about "preserving strength by temporarily surrendering." This is the "survival philosophy" of traitors, and only cowards believe it!

	May 28-29, 1966
	I am 20 years old this year. At this age, one is in a period of flourishing knowledge and physical strength. Chairman Mao said: "You young people are full of vigor, in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you." At this age, one must definitely establish a great ambition to serve the motherland and the people.

	Do young people pursue eating, drinking, and entertainment day and night? Do they pursue love and small families? Absolutely not. These are decadent bourgeois ideas, which we do not adopt. The hearts of young people should be vast, standing high and looking far. We must be like the seagulls in the storm, not like the sparrows circling the eaves. I must strive to study Chairman Mao's works, establish a proletarian worldview and a life philosophy of serving the people.

	August 1, 1966
	The Central People's Broadcasting Station's broadcast to overseas Chinese starts broadcasting Chairman Mao's quotations from August 1. To better study Chairman Mao's works, grasp Mao Zedong Thought, and treat Mao Zedong Thought as the highest directive for all work, my diary also starts copying down Chairman Mao's quotations from August 1. I will learn from Chairman Mao's good student Lei Feng, from Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, and Liu Yingjun, and use their diaries as a source of inspiration for myself.

	August 5, 1966
	Chairman Mao recently issued a great call: to turn the army into a revolutionary school, and to turn the entire country into a revolutionary school.

	The people of the motherland are currently holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, determined to turn the entire country into a school of Mao Zedong Thought. They are striving to be able to work with a hammer, plow with a plow, fight with a gun, and write with a pen, and in the three great revolutionary movements, to temper themselves into highly politically conscious, all-around developed communist new people.

	Chairman Mao's great directive has equally great significance for us living under white terror. Although the environment does not allow us to master various professions, we must learn as much as possible within our reach, so that we can be like small screws, tightening wherever needed.

	August 7, 1966
	Chairman Mao said: "China's broad revolutionary intellectuals, although they have the role of vanguards and bridges, are not all able to revolutionize to the end. Some of them, when the revolution reaches a critical moment, will withdraw from the revolutionary ranks and take a passive attitude; a few will even become enemies of the revolution. This shortcoming of intellectuals can only be overcome in long-term mass struggles."

	Everyone says, it seems that Chairman Mao knows our situation and points out the correct path for us.

	Under the white terror in this island country, at this moment when the Indonesian reactionaries and the Kuomintang bandits collude to carry out bloody persecution against patriotic overseas Chinese, for every patriotic overseas Chinese student and every patriotic overseas Chinese, this is a serious test. If you are a patriot, you must stand firm and resolutely defend the dignity of the motherland; if you are wholeheartedly serving the people, you must dare to face the enemy's threats and bribes, dare to sacrifice yourself, and fight to the end for the people's interests.

	August 9, 1966
	An individual is extremely insignificant, and the issue of life and death is trivial. However, if one can dedicate everything to the cause of serving the people, sacrifice oneself for the collective, even if it is in obscurity, one should feel contented.

	August 19, 1966
	Now I feel that I have boundless strength to work and struggle, not because I have any special abilities, but because I am like a drop of water, merging into the ocean, surging forward with the rolling waves.

	August 23, 1966
	The meaning of "selflessness" is to work hard for the collective cause, without regard for personal gains or losses, without concern for personal fame and fortune. Because it is for serving the people, everything should be based on the people's interests, "persisting in what is good for the people and correcting what is wrong for the people." For the people, for the collective cause, contribute one's youth, and even one's life.

	September 11, 1966
	In the days of working for the overseas Chinese, I deeply feel that I know too little. I was too unrealistic and too ambitious in the past. Chairman Mao instructed us: "If one wants to directly recognize certain or some things, one must personally participate in the struggle to transform reality, to transform certain or some things, in order to touch the phenomena of that thing or those things, and only in personally participating in the struggle to transform reality can one expose the essence of that thing or those things and understand them." Summarizing past experiences, I have made up my mind to follow Chairman Mao's words, starting from scratch, to learn well in serving the masses, and to be a student of the masses.

	September 27, 1966
	Living under white terror is not necessarily a bad thing. Bloody class struggles, inhuman racial discrimination, and various demons and monsters all appear before you, making you see the ugly faces of the reactionaries clearly, remember class hatred firmly, and raise your thoughts of fighting against the enemy high.

	The more we experience here, the more we deeply realize the correctness and greatness of Chairman Mao's words, and thus we are filled with confidence to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions: "Make up your mind, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

    毛泽东思想哺育着海外英雄儿女
    ——归国华侨青年余亚周日记摘抄
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的战斗集体——四十一名华侨青少年在印尼狱中的英勇斗争事迹，传遍了全中国，传遍了全世界。这里发表的余亚周被捕前的日记摘抄说明，正是伟大的毛泽东思想，哺育着我们华侨青少年的成长。余亚周是四十一名青少年当中的一个，今年二十岁，出生在印尼一个贫苦劳动人民的华侨家庭。他被印尼反动派非法逮捕以前，靠半工半读在棉兰华侨中学读书时，就同广大爱国华侨青年一起，勤奋地学习毛主席著作。从他的日记中，人们可以看到，伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，给了我们海外的英雄儿女们多么巨大的斗争力量。
        一九六六年五月九日
    一个人思想的改造可不是容易的事啊！它要经过深思，经过斗争。要找书籍阅读，首先是要用毛主席的《纪念白求恩》和《为人民服务》来鞭策和激励自己。思想改造的过程又是一个痛苦的过程。有时克服了错误，可是过不多久，不对头的思想苗头又露了出来，这又要经过一番苦斗来克服。
                    五月十日
      “中国成功地爆炸了含有热核材料的核武器！”一大早，这个振奋人心的消息传遍了整个宿舍（注：指棉兰华侨中学宿舍）。同学们个个欢欣鼓舞，有的笑得合不拢嘴，有的激动得振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    我实在不能抑制内心的兴奋。上午有事外出，一遇熟人便告诉他这个好消息。小陈听了高兴得叫了起来，看着她，我想，要是让全体同学、全体华侨马上听到这个消息，该有多好！
    祖国啊！在我们受到帝国主义走狗欺侮的时候，你给我们出了一口气；在我们最困难的时刻，你给我们以力量。我们要努力奋斗，当个无愧于中华人民共和国的侨民。
                    五月十六日
      “为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。在反动派的铡刀下，在生死关头，在面对牛鬼蛇神的死亡威胁下，想起了毛主席的这个教导，就能够坚强不屈，坚决为维护华侨的利益，为维护祖国的尊严而奋斗到底，甚至付出自己宝贵的生命也在所不惜。
    我们侨居在国外的中国侨民，即使是在刺刀威胁着的日子里，也要像祖国人民一样高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，蔑视一切与人民为敌的牛鬼蛇神，坚决跟它们斗争到底。帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，它们貌似强大，实质上都是虚弱的。只要毫不畏惧地反对它，是完全可以打倒的。……
    我们听了祖国电台广播的一位西藏翻身农奴声讨反党反社会主义分子的文章。你听，她的声音多么坚决：“没有共产党，我们百万藏族农奴就不能得到解放；没有毛主席，我们就没有今天幸福的生活。”她的声音给我们以战斗的力量。我们这里虽然还是黑夜，正在遭受空前未有的苦难和浩劫，可是，我们在任何情况下，都要听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做一个对得起自己伟大祖国和祖国人民的侨民！
                  五月二十三日
    敢不敢蔑视敌人，能不能在敌人铡刀下做到脸不变色心不跳，肯不肯为人民的利益、为祖国的尊严牺牲自己，这是真革命和假革命的分界线，是真诚的革命者和无耻的叛徒的分水岭。
    赵小寿、黄沐和两同志的英雄事迹告诉我们：对敌人绝不能存在任何幻想。毛主席说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”毛主席还教导我们：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。欺软怕硬的反动派是完全可以打倒的。
    欺软怕硬，是一切反动派的本性。你越怕他，越要与他妥协，他就越欺侮你。只要我们直起腰板，挺起胸膛，板起脸孔，“横眉冷对千夫指”，跟他针锋相对。就是在他们的屠刀下，也要坚持斗争，不怕牺牲，不怕流血。决不能说什么“为了保存实力，暂时投降”。这是变节者的“活命哲学”，怕死鬼才相信它！
            五月二十八日——二十九日
    我今年是二十岁。一个人在这个时期，正是长知识、长体力的兴旺时期。毛主席说：“你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”在这个时期里，一定要很好地树立为祖国和为人民服务的雄心壮志。
    年青人日夜追求的是吃喝玩乐吗？是爱情和小家庭吗？决不是。这些都是腐朽的资产阶级思想，我们是不取的。我们青年人的胸怀应该无比宽广，要站得高，看得远。我们要做出没于暴风雨中的海燕，不做绕屋盘梁的麻雀。我一定要努力学习毛主席著作，树立无产阶级的世界观和为人民服务的人生观。
                        八月一日
    北京中央人民广播电台对国外华侨广播的节目自八月一日起播送毛主席语录，为了更好地学习毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想当作一切工作的最高指示，我的日记也自八月一日起把毛主席语录抄录下来。我要向毛主席的好学生雷锋学习，向欧阳海、王杰、焦裕禄、刘英俊学习，把他们的日记当作鼓舞自己的力量。
                      八月五日
    毛主席最近发出了一个伟大的号召：把解放军办成一所革命化的大学校，把全国办成一所革命化的大学校。
    祖国人民目前正高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，决心把全国办成一所毛泽东思想的大学校，他们正努力做到拿起铁锤就能做工，拿起犁头就能耕地，拿起枪杆就能打仗，拿起笔杆就能写文章，在三大革命运动中，把自己锻炼成有高度政治觉悟的全面发展的共产主义新人。
    毛主席这一伟大的指示，对生活在白色恐怖下的我们同样具有重大意义。虽然环境不许可我们精通各行各业，但我们要在尽可能的范围内学习多方面的工作，使我们自己能像小螺丝钉一样，那里需要就拧到那里去。
                      八月七日
    毛主席说：“中国的广大的革命知识分子虽然有先锋的和桥梁的作用，但不是所有这些知识分子都能革命到底的。其中一部分，到了革命的紧急关头，就会脱离革命队伍，采取消极态度；其中少数人，就会变成革命的敌人。知识分子的这种缺点，只有在长期的群众斗争中才能克服。”
    同学们都说，毛主席他老人家仿佛知道我们这边的情况似的，并且给我们指出了正确的道路。
    在白色恐怖笼罩下的千岛之国，在印尼反动派和蒋介石匪帮互相勾结，对爱国华侨进行血腥迫害的这个时刻，对于每一个爱国的华侨学生、每一个爱国侨胞来说，是一个严重的考验。你是一个爱国者，你就要站稳立场，坚决维护祖国的尊严；你是全心全意为人民服务的，你就得敢于面对敌人的威逼利诱，敢于牺牲自我，为人民的利益奋斗到底。
                      八月九日
    个人是无比渺小的，个人的生死问题是无足轻重的。但是，如果能把个人的一切贡献给为人民服务的事业，为集体牺牲自己，即使是默默无闻，也应该是感到欣慰了。
                    八月十九日
    现在我觉得自己有着无穷的力量去工作，去斗争，这决不是因为我有什么特殊的才能，而是因为自己有如一滴水，融汇在大海里，随着滚滚波涛，向前冲击。
                  八月二十三日
    “忘我”的含义就是为集体事业忠心耿耿地苦干，不计较个人得失，不顾个人名利。因为是为人民服务的，所以一切都从人民的利益出发，“为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”。为人民，为集体事业，贡献出自己的青春，以至于自己的生命。
              九月十一日
    在为难侨工作的日子里，使我深切地感觉到，自己所知道的东西实在太少了。我过去太不踏实，太好高骛远了。毛主席指示我们说：“如果要直接地认识某种或某些事物，便只有亲身参加于变革现实、变革某种或某些事物的实践的斗争中，才能触到那种或那些事物的现象，也只有在亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争中，才能暴露那种或那些事物的本质而理解它们。”总结过去的经验，我下定决心按毛主席的话去做，一切从头学起，要在为群众工作中好好学习，做群众的小学生。
                  九月二十七日
    生活在白色恐怖下，也并不算是一件坏事。鲜血淋淋的阶级斗争，惨无人道的种族歧视，形形色色的牛鬼蛇神，都展现在你面前，叫你把反动派的丑恶嘴脸看得清清楚楚的，把阶级仇恨记得牢牢的，把对敌斗争的思想提得高高的。
    我们在这里经历的事情越多，就越发深切地认识到毛主席的话的无比正确和英明伟大，从而使我们充满信心地按照毛主席的指示去做：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
                                        （新华社）
