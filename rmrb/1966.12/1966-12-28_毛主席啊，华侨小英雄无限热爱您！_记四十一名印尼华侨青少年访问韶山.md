Recently returned to the country, 41 overseas Chinese youth who fought bravely for 40 days in Indonesian prisons, along with two representatives of overseas Chinese youth who participated in the November 9th Medan Overseas Chinese School "refugee camp" anti-violence struggle, on December 23rd, on their way to Beijing, with boundless excitement, specially visited the hometown of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, Shaoshan, to pay tribute to Chairman Mao's former residence.

These heroic overseas Chinese youth, on the enemy's prison trucks, behind the iron bars of the prison cells, in front of the bayonets of the fascist police, were inspired by the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fight bravely and unyieldingly against the enemy, upholding national dignity and safeguarding the dignity of the great motherland. Now, they have come to the place where the red sun rises every day and night, and everyone repeatedly shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and wished Chairman Mao eternal life. They said: This is the most unforgettable day of our lives, the happiest day of our lives!

On the 23rd, the temperature dropped to minus three or four degrees Celsius. The little heroes who had just returned from overseas encountered such cold weather for the first time, but they were still surging with emotion and boiling with revolutionary passion during the visit. They read Chairman Mao's quotations aloud over and over again, singing "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." They regarded every exhibit they saw in Chairman Mao's former residence and the exhibition hall, and every explanation they heard, as living textbooks for learning Mao Zedong Thought, eagerly absorbing from them the strength to educate and inspire themselves.

During the visit to the former residence, the overseas Chinese youth lingered in front of the bed where Chairman Mao was born, on the land where he worked, in the places where he studied, at the wooden table where he held revolutionary meetings, and in the room where he personally established the Shaoshan Party branch. They listened carefully to the guide's explanations, gently touched every item used by Chairman Mao, and wrote detailed notes in their red notebooks. On the threshing ground where Chairman Mao worked, the little heroes sang again the song they collectively created in the Indonesian prison, expressing their endless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao! You are the red sun in our hearts. To follow your teachings, we solemnly swear: We will dedicate our beautiful youth and our blood to defend the dignity of the motherland!"

Qiu Yuehao, who has deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai" in the Indonesian prison. When faced with savage beatings and illegal interrogations, he always showed a firm and fearless revolutionary spirit. Today, he was very excited during the visit and said: The birth of the great socialist motherland is so difficult! For the revolution, Chairman Mao's family has six relatives who sacrificed their precious lives. We must inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the revolutionary forerunners, never forget class struggle, never forget that the majority of people in the world are still suffering, and always follow Chairman Mao to make revolution for life. Nineteen-year-old Zheng Xiancai, during the visit, thought of how Mao Zedong Thought guided them to fight unyieldingly against the Indonesian reactionaries, and she became even more determined in her belief in Mao Zedong Thought. She said: Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible and unstoppable spiritual atomic bomb! It makes us see light in the darkness and gain courage in difficulties. As long as we master it, we can defeat all enemies and achieve victory. I will definitely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, study and apply Chairman Mao's works more actively, eliminate all selfish thoughts, and dedicate my youth and strength to socialist motherland and the world revolution.

Wu Zhao'an and Xie Jiefang, who were teaching in the overseas Chinese school before being arrested by the Indonesian reactionaries, also repeatedly expressed during the visit: In the future, we must definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, temper and reform ourselves through labor, learn from workers and peasants, and cultivate ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause who are both workers and peasants, both intellectuals and soldiers.

During the visit, when the overseas Chinese youth saw the portraits of the six martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the revolution in the exhibition hall of the former residence, everyone was moved to tears. They took out their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud in unison: "Tens of thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward on their blood-stained path!" Yu Yazhou, who faced the enemy's guns and denounced the fascist bandits in the Indonesian prison, led everyone in raising their right hands and solemnly swearing: "Our heads can be cut off, our blood can be shed, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned. We will dedicate our lives to the proletarian revolutionary cause. We will defend the Party Central Committee to the death! We will defend Chairman Mao to the death! We will defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death!"

    毛主席啊，华侨小英雄无限热爱您！
    ——记四十一名印尼华侨青少年访问韶山
    新近回国的在印尼监狱里进行了四十天英勇斗争的四十一名华侨青少年，和两名参加十一月九日棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”抗暴斗争的难侨青年代表，十二月二十三日在前往北京的途中，怀着无限激动的心情，专程来到我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的家乡韶山，瞻仰了毛主席旧居。
    这些英雄的华侨青少年，在印尼反动派的囚车上，在牢房铁窗下，在法西斯军警的刺刀面前，是伟大的领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想鼓舞着他们同敌人进行了英勇不屈的斗争，坚持了民族气节，维护了伟大祖国的尊严。现在，他们来到了日夜思念的红太阳升起的地方，人人都一再放声高呼“毛主席万岁”，祝愿毛主席万寿无疆。他们说：这是我们有生以来最最难忘的一天，最最幸福的一天！
    二十三日这天，气温下降到了零下三四度，刚从海外归来的小英雄们还是第一次遇到这样的严寒，但是他们在参观中始终心潮澎湃，热血沸腾，洋溢着无限的革命豪情。他们在这里一遍又一遍地齐声朗读毛主席语录，高唱《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》和《大海航行靠舵手》。他们把在毛主席旧居和旧居陈列馆见到的每一件展品，听到的每一句讲解，都作为自己学习毛泽东思想的活教材，如饥似渴地从中吸取教育自己和鞭策自己的力量。
    在参观旧居的时候，华侨青少年们在毛主席诞生的床前，在毛主席劳动过的土地上和读过书的地方，在毛主席召开过革命会议的木桌旁和亲自建立韶山党支部的房间里，都久久地舍不得离开。他们仔细倾听着讲解员的讲解，轻轻地抚摸着毛主席当年用过的每一件用具，还在鲜红的笔记本上写下了详细的记录。在毛主席劳动过的晒谷场上，小英雄们又一次唱起了他们在印尼狱中集体创作的一首歌曲，表达他们对毛主席的无限热爱和无限忠诚：“毛主席啊！您是我们心中的红太阳，为了遵循您的教导，我们庄严宣誓：我们将以美丽的青春，用自己的鲜血，誓死保卫祖国的尊严！”对毛主席怀有深厚阶级感情的丘月豪，在印尼狱中始终牢记毛主席“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的教导，在遭到野蛮毒打和非法审讯时，始终表现了坚贞不屈、无所畏惧的革命气概。今天他在参观中非常激动地说：伟大的社会主义祖国的诞生，是多么不容易啊！为了革命，毛主席一家就有六个亲人献出了宝贵的生命。我们一定要继承和发扬革命先辈的革命传统，永远不忘阶级斗争，不忘世界上还有大多数人民正在受苦受难，永远跟着毛主席闹一辈子革命。十九岁的郑仙彩，在参观中联想起毛泽东思想指引他们同印尼反动派进行不屈不挠斗争的种种情景，更加坚定了她无限崇拜毛泽东思想的信念。她说：毛泽东思想是战无不胜、攻无不克的精神原子弹！它使我们在黑暗中见到光明，困难中提高勇气。只要掌握了它，就能战胜一切敌人，取得胜利。我一定响应林彪副主席的号召，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，清除一切私心杂念，为社会主义祖国，为世界革命贡献自己的青春和力量。被印尼反动派逮捕前在华侨中学担任教师的吴招安和谢捷芳，也在参观中一再表示：今后一定要牢记毛主席的教导，到农村中参加农业生产，在劳动中锻炼改造自己，向工农学习，把自己培养成为亦工亦农、亦文亦武的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    在参观中，当华侨青少年们在旧居陈列馆看到毛主席一家为革命牺牲的六位烈士的遗像时，大家都激动得热泪盈眶。他们当场掏出红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，激昂地齐声朗读：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”在印尼监狱中面对敌人的枪口痛斥法西斯匪徒的余亚周，接着领着大家举起右手庄严地宣誓：“头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢。我们将以自己的一生贡献给无产阶级革命事业。誓死保卫党中央！誓死保卫毛主席！誓死保卫毛泽东思想！”
