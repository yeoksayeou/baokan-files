The headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) held a joint meeting of standing committee members and active members in Tokyo on the 3rd and 4th of this month to summarize the experience of the struggle against anti-China elements and the struggle against revisionism since late October. The meeting emphasized that to further develop the Japan-China friendship movement, it is necessary to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

Representatives from 23 prefectures, from Kagoshima in the south to Hokkaido in the north, attended the meeting.

The Chinese trade union delegation led by Kang Yonghe was invited to attend the meeting.

Vice Chairman Kuroda Jutaro of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) Headquarters said at the meeting, "Because we have driven out the destructive forces, the Japan-China friendship movement has begun to develop from a new starting point. Kuroda called on the attendees to, based on the demands of the broad masses of the Japanese people, strive to develop a grand Japan-China friendship movement.

Chairman Miyazaki Seiken said in his speech that the important significance of this meeting is to, on the basis of upholding the glorious tradition, further develop the Japan-China friendship movement.

Director of the General Affairs Bureau Miyoshi Kazuichi made a general report at the meeting. He said that new followers of Soviet modern revisionism have emerged in Japan, and they have carried out various conspiracies to destroy the unity of the peoples of the two countries. The contradiction between these destructive elements and the broad masses of the Japanese people who truly desire Japan-China friendship is an antagonistic contradiction. Miyoshi said that the struggle of the Japanese people against a small handful of anti-China elements is rapidly unfolding across the country, and currently, 13 prefectures have established branches of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), and branches have been established in many places.

Representatives from various places spoke passionately at the meeting. They pointed out that to develop the Japan-China friendship movement, it is necessary to strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought. They talked about the fierce struggles against revisionism in various places and expressed their firm belief that the unity of the peoples of the two countries is unbreakable by any force.

The representative from Kagoshima said that some people say that one can oppose China while fighting against American imperialism, which is a lie. The people of Japan and various countries in Asia understand that only the path pointed out by Chairman Mao is the path to national liberation. Therefore, they are concerned about and study Mao Zedong Thought.

Representative Yamaguchi Kenkoku from Yamaguchi Prefecture said that the new followers of Soviet modern revisionism are frantically destroying Japan-China friendship and are the guerrilla forces of American imperialism. He pointed out that now, on all fronts, we must struggle for friendship with China and strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought.

A representative from a certain district in Tokyo said that the new followers of Soviet revisionism have joined the anti-China chorus directed by the American imperialists, thus exposing their true faces as monsters and demons.

A representative from Yokohama City emphasized that anti-China elements are most afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, so they desperately attack Mao Zedong Thought. This representative emphasized the need to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle.

Kang Yonghe was invited to speak at the meeting. He expressed his sincere congratulations and firm support for the establishment of the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) and its genuine prefectural branches and sub-branches, and announced the severance of all ties with the old Japan-China Friendship Association, which is controlled by a small handful of anti-China elements.

Kang Yonghe expressed his firm support for the statement of 32 prominent figures in Japan and the joint statement signed by the representatives of the two friendly associations of China and Japan. He said: "At present, American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionism, and their various new and old followers are extremely afraid of the friendship between the peoples of the two countries and are constantly working hard to obstruct and destroy the exchanges and friendship between China and Japan. However, the China-Japan friendship movement has not been weakened or reduced because of their obstruction and destruction, but has been strengthened and expanded."

Kang Yonghe said: "Recently, some people talk about China-Japan friendship, but in action, they collude with American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and Japanese reactionaries to oppose China-Japan friendship. These people actually participate in the anti-China chorus. This is nothing to be surprised about; they can only play the role of a pitiful clown. In the face of the powerful current of China-Japan friendship, they are like 'ants trying to shake a big tree.'"

Kang Yonghe said: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Friends have true and false, but through practice, we can see who is a true friend and who is a false friend.' Now, who is maintaining China-Japan friendship and who is opposing it, the lines are becoming clearer. This is the inevitable result of the deepening development of the China-Japan friendship movement."

Kang Yonghe said: The Chinese people must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, adhere to the policy of developing friendship between the peoples of the two countries, and through our joint efforts, "push the combat friendship between the peoples of the two countries in the struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys to a new height." Kang Yonghe's speech was warmly welcomed by the attendees.

The meeting adopted a declaration, calling for strengthening the combat friendship and unity between the peoples of the two countries. The declaration pointed out that the biggest obstacle to the Japan-China friendship movement at present is a small handful of destructive elements who, under the banner of "Japan-China friendship," engage in anti-China activities. We, starting from the wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people, to develop a genuine Japan-China friendship movement, resolutely unite around the genuine headquarters.

The declaration pointed out that strengthening genuine Japan-China friendship is a powerful support for the Vietnamese people who are fighting against American imperialism, and a contribution to Asian peace and Japanese independence.

The declaration extends warm greetings to the seven hundred million Chinese people who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and are carrying out a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution.

The meeting also decided that the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) Headquarters will establish branches in all prefectures nationwide by the end of this year and plans to hold a national congress in April next year.

    新华社五日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会（正统）总部三、四两日在东京召开常任理事和积极分子联席会议，总结从十月下旬以来同反华分子进行斗争和在全国各地展开反修斗争的经验。会议强调指出，为了进一步发展日中友好运动，必须活学活用毛主席著作。
    南自鹿儿岛北至北海道的二十三个都道府县的一百六十名代表出席了会议。
    由康永和率领的中国工会访日代表团应邀出席了会议。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部副会长黑田寿男在会上讲话说，由于我们赶走了破坏势力，开始使日中友好运动从一个新的起点向前发展。黑田号召与会者根据广大日本人民的要求，努力发展规模宏伟的日中友好运动。
    总部理事长宫崎世民在发言中指出，这次会议的重要意义是，在维护光荣传统的基础上，进一步发展日中友好运动。
    总部事务局长三好一在会上作了总报告。他说，日本出现了苏联现代修正主义的新的追随者，他们为了破坏日中两国人民的团结进行了各种各样的阴谋活动，这些破坏分子同希望真正日中友好的日本广大人民之间的矛盾是敌我矛盾。三好一说，日本人民同一小撮反华分子的斗争正在全国各地迅速展开，目前已经有十三个府和县建立了日中友好协会（正统）分会，并在许多地方成立了支部。
    各地代表在会上热烈发言。他们指出，为了发展日中友好运动，必须努力学习毛泽东思想。他们谈到了各地同修正主义进行激烈斗争的情况，并且表示坚信，日中两国人民的团结是任何力量也破坏不了的。
    鹿儿岛代表指出，有人说可以一面反对中国一面同美帝国主义斗争，这是撒谎。日本和亚洲各国人民懂得，只有毛主席指出的道路，才是争取民族解放的道路。因此，他们关心毛泽东思想，学习毛泽东思想。
    山口县代表塚本正国说，苏联现代修正主义的新追随者，正在疯狂地破坏日中友好，他们是美帝国主义的别动队。他指出，现在在各条战线上，都要为同中国友好而斗争，要努力学习毛泽东思想。
    东京某区的代表说，苏修的新追随者参加了由美帝指挥的反华大合唱的行列，这就暴露了他们的牛鬼蛇神的真面目。
    横滨市的代表强调说，反华分子最怕毛泽东思想，所以他们拚命攻击毛泽东思想。这位代表强调要在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作。
    康永和应邀在会上讲话。他对日中友好协会（正统）总部的成立和它的正统县分会以及支部的成立表示衷心祝贺和坚决支持，并且宣布同被一小撮反华分子所把持的旧日中友好协会断绝一切来往。
    康永和表示坚决支持日本三十二位知名人士的声明以及中国和日本两个友好协会代表团所签署的共同声明。他说：“当前，美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的新旧追随者，害怕中日两国人民友好，害怕得要命，他们无时无刻不在卖劲地阻挠中日友好往来，破坏中日友好关系。但是，中日友好运动并没有因为他们的阻挠、破坏而削弱、缩小，而是更加加强，更加扩大了。”
    康永和说：“最近，有些人口头上讲中日友好，但在行动上却同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、日本反动派狼狈为奸，一股劲反对中日友好。这些人实际上参加了反华大合唱。这并没有什么了不起，他们只能充当一名可怜的跳梁小丑。在强大的中日友好的洪流面前，他们就像‘蚍蜉撼大树’。”
    康永和说：“毛主席教导我们：‘朋友有真假，但通过实践可以看清谁是真朋友，谁是假朋友。’现在，谁在维护中日友好，谁在反对中日友好，阵营是越来越明显了。这是中日友好运动深入发展的必然结果。”
    康永和说：中国人民一定要遵循毛主席的教导，坚持发展中日两国人民的友好方针，并且通过我们共同的努力，“把中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中结成的战斗友谊推向一个新的高峰”。康永和的讲话受到与会者的热烈欢迎。
    会议通过宣言，号召加强日中两国人民的战斗友谊和团结。宣言指出，当前阻挠日中友好运动的最大障碍，是打着“日中友好”旗子干着反华勾当的一小撮破坏分子。我们从广大日本人民的愿望出发，为了发展真正的日中友好运动，坚决地团结在正统总部的周围。
    宣言指出，加强真正的日中友好，是对正在反对美帝国主义的越南人民的有力支援，是对亚洲和平和日本独立的贡献。
    宣言向用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民正在进行着气势磅礴的无产阶级文化大革命热烈致意。
    会议还决定，日中友好协会（正统）总部将在今年底以前在全国所有都道府县设立分会，并预定在明年四月召开全国代表大会。（附图片）
