Mao Zedong's great strategic thoughts on people's war are highly valued by the people of Latin America who are fighting for liberation.

A friend from Nicaragua, who is currently engaged in armed struggle, said that in their ranks, almost everyone has a copy of Mao Zedong's military works. He said, "We cherish Mao Zedong's works as we do our own lives, because Mao Zedong's books guide us to gain something more precious than life."

This Nicaraguan patriot said that under the rule, oppression, and plunder of U.S. imperialism and the Somoza family, Nicaragua has become a "hell on earth," with over a million residents living in misery. However, the Nicaraguan people are not willing to live a humiliating life. They have taken up arms, entered the mountains, and engaged in a life-and-death struggle against U.S. imperialism and the reactionary dictatorship.

He said: "The struggle is arduous. U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries have surrounded us, revisionists have betrayed us, and the environment is extremely perilous. However, whenever we recall Mao Zedong's assertion that 'a single spark can start a prairie fire,' we gain more confidence and resolve."

    比生命还珍贵的宝书
    毛主席关于人民战争的伟大战略思想，受到为争取解放而斗争的拉丁美洲人民极大重视。
    一位正在进行武装斗争的尼加拉瓜朋友说，在他们的队伍中，几乎每个人都有一本毛主席的军事著作。他说，“我们就像爱护自己的生命一样爱护毛主席的著作，因为毛主席的书引导我们获得比生命还宝贵的东西。”
    这位尼加拉瓜的爱国人士说，在美帝国主义和索摩查家族反动的统治、奴役和掠夺下，尼加拉瓜已经成为“人间地狱”，一百多万居民生活在水深火热之中。但是，尼加拉瓜人民不甘心过屈辱的生活，他们拿起武器，进入山林，同美帝国主义和反动独裁政府展开了生死的斗争。
    他说：“斗争是艰巨的，美帝国主义和反动派包围了我们，修正主义者出卖我们，环境十分险恶。但是，每当我们想起毛主席‘星星之火，可以燎原’的论断的时候，我们就增强了信心，鼓起了斗志。”
