On the eve of the 27th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," several hundred foreign experts who have been helping China build its country held a study session on "In Memory of Norman Bethune" in Beijing. They expressed their boundless love and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

At the meeting, experts from various countries took Norman Bethune as their model, combining their thoughts and work with his spirit. They said, "Chairman Mao is the contemporary Lenin, the great leader of the world's revolutionary people. Chairman Mao's teachings have shown us the bright path of revolution. 'Always remember Norman Bethune's selfless spirit of serving others without seeking anything for oneself. This is a very important lesson for every revolutionary foreigner. Norman Bethune had no personal gain in his life; he was bold and fearless. His struggle yesterday is our struggle today. We will fight to the end until the people of the world finally take control of their own destiny.' They decided to follow Chairman Mao's words, learn from Norman Bethune, walk the path he walked, and become true communists, fighting for the world revolution for life.

The meeting hall was adorned with red banners reading, "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions." Before the meeting, the foreign experts held red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and recited in various languages, "A foreigner who, without any selfish motives, regards the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause—what kind of spirit is this? It is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism. Every Communist Party member must learn from this spirit." After the meeting, they held hands and sang "The East Is Red" and the international anthem "The Internationale."

Below are excerpts from some of the foreign friends' speeches at the meeting:

**Serve the World Revolution with the Spirit of Internationalism**

Kandasa (Sri Lanka): I started studying Marxist works and Chairman Mao's works four years ago. Initially, I did not understand the significance of Chinese comrades repeatedly studying the "Three Articles." In 1965, I studied the quote from Chairman Mao: "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are stamped with the mark of the class." This quote made me deeply reflect on my past experiences. Later, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with a completely different attitude. I re-examined myself. I thought: Norman Bethune selflessly regarded the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause. ... But do I regard the work I do in China as my own cause? Do I have the spirit of internationalism and communism? Many questions flashed through my mind. The struggle between good and bad, backward and progressive unfolded in my thoughts. One day, I read the article again. "A person's ability may be great or small, but as long as he has this spirit, he is a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has transcended lowly interests, a person who benefits the people." These words deeply moved my heart. I felt that Chairman Mao's words hit me hard, making me start to move forward.

Internationalism is not abstract; in practice, it must take a certain form and be reflected in this or that work. With this question in mind, I read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again and was delighted to find the answer in this article. Chairman Mao said: "Norman Bethune's selfless spirit of serving others without seeking anything for oneself is reflected in his extreme responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. Every Communist Party member must learn from him." I read these lines several times and then began to examine my sense of responsibility to my work. When I made a contribution, I became proud and boastful. Why was I like this? It turned out that I was seeking fame, wanting others to praise me, wanting to stand out. I asked myself another question: "Did Norman Bethune treat his work like this?" So I read the article again. "Feeling proud after making a little contribution, liking to boast, fearing that others would not know." These words seemed to be written especially for me. I felt ashamed. But now I have begun to change.

I am very happy that I have found a priceless treasure, which is Chairman Mao's works, the Mao Zedong Thought that illuminates the entire world with its infinite brilliance. Now, China's movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have given me new inspiration. Lin Biao's instructions on studying Chairman Mao's works have timely helped me understand that the purpose of study is to revolutionize one's thoughts, like Norman Bethune, to serve the world revolution with the spirit of internationalism, not for anything else.

**Treat Chairman Mao's Words as Your Motto**

Ruth Leake (New Zealand): Before coming to China, I did not understand the significance of "In Memory of Norman Bethune." I thought this article was just about Norman Bethune and had nothing to do with me.

When I realized the importance of this article and knew that hundreds of millions of Chinese comrades, especially the Chinese People's Liberation Army, study this article every day, I deeply felt that we foreigners need to study this article even more.

"In Memory of Norman Bethune" embodies the highest peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought. The masses can derive a correct line to guide the world revolutionary struggle from it.

Chairman Mao said: "Leninism holds that the proletariat of capitalist countries must support the liberation struggle of the peoples of colonial and semi-colonial countries, and the proletariat of colonial and semi-colonial countries must support the liberation struggle of the proletariat of capitalist countries. Only then can the world revolution be victorious." This is very important and should be our motto at every moment. This not only applies to hundreds of millions of Chinese people but also to the people of all countries. Imperialism and revisionism are most afraid of the revolutionary unity of the oppressed peoples of the world.

Through the study of this article, the Chinese people have established the principle of working for the revolution and putting the interests of the revolution first. This is an important guarantee for China to firmly establish proletarian dictatorship and never change color. All these have set us an example.

I am a New Zealander. Now I further realize that we must unite the proletariat of my country with the proletariat of other oppressed and exploited countries to fight together to overthrow American imperialism and end imperialist wars! I further realize that only proletarian revolution can bring freedom and independence to the people of my country and the people of other countries in the world. This is my internationalist duty.

**Revolutionary Attitude Toward Revolutionary Work**

Yang Zao (United States): Many years ago, when I first read Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," my understanding was very shallow. At that time, I thought Norman Bethune was indeed a great person. But I thought his greatness was largely due to the objective environment. If he were engaged in ordinary, mundane work, he could not have had the spirit of work like Norman Bethune.

Over the years, I have gradually gained a deeper understanding of what Chairman Mao said about Norman Bethune's "selfless spirit of serving others without seeking anything for oneself," his "extreme responsibility to his work," and his "extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." In this short article, Chairman Mao told us a very profound idea—what is the worldview of the proletariat. I gradually realized that Norman Bethune could become a revolutionary not because of his special work and living environment but mainly because of his proletarian worldview, as Chairman Mao said, "regarding the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause." I realized that no matter when, where, or what kind of work, as long as it is beneficial to the people, it is revolutionary work, and we should treat it with a revolutionary attitude. The fundamental issue lies in our thoughts, not in the objective environment.

I have been living and working in China for twenty years. Most of my time has been spent in the countryside. Before coming to Beijing, I worked in a state farm. During night shifts, problems often arose: such as receiving a phone call in the middle of the night saying the machine had broken down, the cows were sick, the milk sterilizer was broken... At this time, selfish thoughts began to creep into my mind, "After all, the sky won't fall tonight! It's better to sleep and deal with it tomorrow." But another thought urged me to go and see if I could help. In such situations, I worked with the workers all night. Every time we finally solved the problem, I felt very happy. Because Norman Bethune would have done this, and this is what Chairman Mao hoped I would do.

When Chinese workers and peasants knew I was an American, they quickly regarded me as a representative of the American working people and strictly distinguished me from American imperialism. They expressed warm comradely friendship to me. What spirit enables seven hundred million Chinese people to hate imperialism so much while treating an ordinary American so warmly and friendly? What spirit makes seven hundred million Chinese people regard the cause of the oppressed peoples of the world as their own cause? What spirit makes seven hundred million Chinese people live and work in China while embracing the world? This is the spirit of internationalism, the communist spirit of seven hundred million Chinese people under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party. I think we should all seriously learn from this spirit.

**Determined to Strive to Become More Like Norman Bethune**

Shio Mitsuru (Japan): This spring, we Japanese went to Zhoukoudian. During the lunch break, two preschool children playing by the fountain near the rest room fell into the pool. At that moment, a young member of the commune happened to pass by and, without hesitation, jumped into the pool. By the time we all gathered at the poolside, he had already rescued the two children. The Chinese comrade who saved the children thought he had only done what he should have done and quickly left.

I believe we will not attribute such an incident to the personal kindness of the Chinese people but will clearly realize that this is the high awareness of the Chinese people who have become the masters of the country. And the foundation for producing this awareness and raising it is Mao Zedong Thought.

I came to China to participate in the Chinese revolution. What we have seen and heard in China has made us clearly realize that China is the base that raises the Marxism-Leninism banner to inspire the people of the world to carry out the revolution. We are convinced that participating in the Chinese cause is the internationalist task of world communists.

Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. I believe that supporting the socialist revolution and construction of China, which raises the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is one of the most important tasks of world communists. I am convinced that only in this way can we carry out proletarian internationalism. I am determined to strive even harder to become more like Norman Bethune.

**Use the "Three Articles" to Examine One's Thoughts and Actions**

Hong Ruoshi (Britain): Like Norman Bethune, I am also a surgeon. I hope that I can gradually understand the full meaning of "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and put it into practice. One day, I can compare myself with Norman Bethune and become a revolutionary like him. This is my great ambition.

I worked in a British hospital for eighteen years, mostly treating workers. During this time, I regarded myself as a revolutionary and thought I was quite responsible for my work. However, after coming to China and reading Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I began to doubt myself: Was I really as responsible for my work as I thought I was? Looking back, my sense of responsibility was limited and insufficient.

Two days ago, I performed a leg amputation on a critically ill patient (he was the chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association of a people's commune). This operation was very dangerous. In the past, I would have thought, "Don't take this risk, or the doctor's reputation will be ruined." However, due to studying Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I thought, if I were extremely responsible, I should perform the operation for him. So, I and my colleagues performed the operation on him. Now I can happily say that he has withstood the operation. If he can recover, it is because Norman Bethune set us an example to learn from, and it is the result of Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune" teaching us.

The problem of ideological remolding is the basic problem for all revolutionaries. The first step in ideological remolding is to fearlessly use Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" as the standard to examine one's thoughts and actions. The "Three Articles" have made me take only a few steps on the long road to becoming a Communist like Norman Bethune. I will walk this road for life.

**Always Compare Yourself with Norman Bethune**

Epstein (United States): The reputation of the internationalist fighter Norman Bethune is well-known. But he never put on airs. He was not the kind of person who "feels proud after making a little contribution, likes to boast, and fears that others would not know." As a true Communist, he always went to the most difficult and dangerous posts to work and refused to enjoy privileges. He had a burning heart—this is the heart of loving comrades and selflessly serving the people.

I think this is an education for those among us who are older and have more experience and thus always regard themselves as authorities. "Putting on airs" is a fatal disease. In essence, it is a reactionary thing. Of course, long-accumulated experience can be very valuable. But only when the person who gains the experience continues to progress and becomes a more steadfast revolutionary, does that experience have value. The size of this value is determined by the masses, not by oneself. We should always compare ourselves with Norman Bethune.

Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought has pointed out a path for us to fight against imperialism led by American imperialism and to fight against revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership. To defeat imperialism, we must oppose revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership.

We want to serve the people, so we must constantly remold ourselves, improve our work, and improve our style. Only in this way can we embody proletarian internationalism with our actual actions; only in this way can we get closer to the Chinese people; only in this way can we make beneficial contributions to the Chinese people, our own people, and the people of the world.

**Take Norman Bethune's Spirit as the Model for Your Actions**

Martins (Brazil): Chairman Mao said: "A foreigner who, without any selfish motives, regards the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause—what kind of spirit is this? It is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism. Every member of the Chinese Communist Party must learn from this spirit."

Chinese comrades working abroad are following Chairman Mao's teachings, with the spirit of proletarian internationalism and without any selfish motives, regarding the cause of the people of other countries as their own cause. According to Xinhua News Agency, China has helped Tanzania build a powerful radio station. The Chinese comrades working there live in old tents on the construction site and make their own tables and chairs from scrap wood. They work at least ten hours a day under the scorching sun. Whenever they encounter difficulties, they study Chairman Mao's "In the Service of the People," "On Practice," and the brilliant work we are commemorating—"In Memory of Norman Bethune," drawing strength from them. Chinese workers and experts regard the cause of the Tanzanian people as their own cause. Tanzanian people and leaders think that all this is more important help than the design of the radio station itself.

These Chinese comrades have set us a brilliant example of turning Norman Bethune's spirit into action at any time and in any place.

Communist Party members in Brazil, Latin America, and other colonial, semi-colonial, and not yet independent countries should unite with the proletariat of all capitalist countries. As Chairman Mao said, "Only then can we defeat imperialism, liberate our nations and peoples."

In today's world, this unity is based on the struggle against imperialism led by American imperialism and the new and old colonialism, and against their agents—the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet leadership.

**Break the "I" and Establish the "Public," Strive to Remold Yourself**

Suleya (Tanzania): My understanding of class and class struggle is not high, but it is much higher than before I came to China. I want to thank the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese people for giving me the most urgent education.

Dr. Norman Bethune's internationalist spirit is the spirit of serving the people of the world. To become like Norman Bethune, one needs to undergo long-term remolding, first breaking down the "I" step by step and establishing the "public."

Norman Bethune never considered personal interests; he was very enthusiastic and dedicated to others, taking great responsibility for others. This is the quality of this communist warrior. We should learn from him.

China is the best school for us to learn from. We should learn from Norman Bethune and learn from heroes who walk the path of Norman Bethune, such as Wang Jie and Mai Xiande.

**Defend Mao Zedong Thought and Care About the Cultural Revolution**

Morille (France): After studying this article, I was deeply moved. Every time I reread it, I am moved. Studying Norman Bethune's spirit means we should uproot the roots of individualism in our minds. Norman Bethune's example should inspire us to carry out self-revolution, engrave proletarian thoughts in our minds, and better participate in the revolutionary mass movement and the anti-American struggle. Studying Norman Bethune's spirit should make us strive to defend Mao Zedong Thought and Lin Biao's instructions. We should pay more attention to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

**With Mao Zedong Thought, You Can Achieve Victory in Ideological Remolding**

Enrique (Colombia): Norman Bethune's communist spirit is to sweep away all the obstacles of the old world and establish this truth: class hatred and class love, deep hatred for the enemy, and boundless love for the people.

We are living in China, which is building socialism and carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We believe that at any time, in any place, and in all revolutionary work, we must carry forward and develop Norman Bethune's spirit.

I come from the capitalist world. I understand that to dedicate oneself to the proletarian cause, one must remold one's worldview and establish a proletarian worldview. The road to ideological remolding is long, difficult, and sometimes painful. However, with Mao Zedong Thought and the example of Norman Bethune and revolutionary practice, our ideological remolding will definitely achieve victory.

**With a Class Perspective, You Can Master Mao Zedong Thought**

Ma Haide (United States): "In Memory of Norman Bethune" has been published for 27 years. Practice has proven that Chairman Mao has made great contributions to the development of Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is a great truth. It has made outstanding contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Now, seven hundred million Chinese people are studying Mao Zedong Thought, and this movement has also promoted our ideological revolutionization. We must strive to master Mao Zedong Thought.

Norman Bethune is a true internationalist of the proletariat. He always fought in the most difficult places. Dr. Norman Bethune loved the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao. He regarded the Chinese revolution as his own cause. He saw the world revolution in the Chinese revolution. He came to China to engage in the world revolution. "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I have read many times, and each time I have new insights. It has helped and inspired me. I have realized that only by acting according to Chairman Mao's thoughts can we make progress. Studying Chairman Mao's works must have a proletarian worldview and a class perspective; otherwise, we cannot master it.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has put forward the task of establishing communist thoughts for each of us, as the Chinese comrades say, "break the 'private' and establish the 'public.' This is very important for us and also very important for the world revolution. How do we commemorate Norman Bethune? It is to learn from him to thoroughly break down the "private" and replace it with the "public."

**Fight to the End Along the Path of Norman Bethune**

Monique (Belgium): Always remembering Norman Bethune's selfless spirit of serving others without seeking anything for oneself is a very important lesson for us who have come to work in China. We should ask ourselves: Do we have the courage to fight to the end for our beliefs like Norman Bethune? If tomorrow American imperialism launches a final war, intending to fight to the death with the obstacle to its world hegemony—China, at that time, Norman Bethune will tell us how to defend our posts.

Norman Bethune had no personal gain in his life; he was bold and fearless. His struggle yesterday is our struggle today. We will fight to the end until the people of the world finally take control of their own destiny.

    学习毛主席的著作　做白求恩式的战士
    ——在北京的外国专家学习《纪念白求恩》座谈纪要
    新华社二十一日讯　在毛主席的光辉著作《纪念白求恩》发表二十七周年的前夕，在北京帮助我国建设的数百名外国专家，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对伟大的毛泽东思想无比崇拜的心情，举行了学习《纪念白求恩》的座谈会。
    在座谈会上，各国专家以白求恩同志为榜样，结合自己的思想和工作，热烈发言。他们说，“毛主席是当代的列宁，是世界革命人民的伟大领袖，毛主席的教导给我们指出了革命的光明大道”。“经常牢记白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的献身精神，对于每个革命的外国人是很重要的一课。白求恩一生毫无私心，大胆无畏。他昨天的战斗，也就是我们今天的战斗。我们要战斗到底，一直到世界人民最后掌握自己的命运为止”。他们决心听毛主席的话，向白求恩学习，走白求恩走过的路，做一个真正的共产主义战士，为世界革命奋斗终身。
    会场上悬挂着红色横幅，上面写着林彪同志的号召：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。”座谈会前，各国专家手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，用各种语言齐声朗诵：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神”，“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。”座谈会结束以后，大家手挽着手，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和世界无产阶级的战歌《国际歌》。
    下面是部分外国朋友在座谈会上的发言纪要：
      以国际主义精神为世界革命服务
    康德萨密（锡兰）：我是四年前开始学习马克思主义著作和毛主席著作的。起先，我对中国同志反复学习“老三篇”的意义，不太理解。一九六五年我学习了毛主席语录：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”这条语录使我深深地回顾了我过去的经历。随后，我用与过去完全不同的态度学习了《纪念白求恩》一文。我重新检查了自己。我想：白求恩毫不自私地把中国人民的解放事业当做自己的事业。……而我是否把在中国做的工作看作自己的事业呢？我有没有国际主义精神、共产主义精神？许多问题从我脑子里闪过。坏与好、落后与进步的斗争在我思想里展开了。一天我再次读了这篇文章。“一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”这些话深深打动了我的心。我觉得毛主席说的话狠狠地打中了我，使我开始前进。
    国际主义不是抽象的，在实践中，它必定采取一定的形式，表现在这项或那项工作中。带着这种问题，我再次读了《纪念白求恩》，我惊喜地发现答案就在这篇文章中。毛主席说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。”我把这几行念了好几遍，然后开始检查我的工作责任感。当我做出点贡献的时候，我骄傲、自吹起来。为什么我会这样呢？原来我在追求名誉、要人奉承我，想出风头。我又对自己提出一个问题：“白求恩同志是这样对待他的工作吗？”于是我再次读了这篇文章。“出了一点力就觉得了不起，喜欢自吹，生怕人家不知道。”这段话好像特意为我写的。我感到羞愧。但是现在我开始有了改变。
    我很高兴，我找到了无价之宝，这就是毛主席著作，就是用无限光辉照耀全世界的毛泽东思想。现在，中国活学活用毛主席著作运动和无产阶级文化大革命给了我新的鼓舞。林彪同志的关于学习毛主席著作的指示及时地使我懂得，学习的目的是使思想革命化，像白求恩一样以国际主义精神为世界革命服务，而不是为了别的东西。
      把毛主席的话当作自己的座右铭
    露丝·雷克（新西兰）：来中国前，我看不懂《纪念白求恩》这篇著作，我想《纪念白求恩》这篇文章谈的就是白求恩，和我没有关系。
    当我认识到这篇文章的重要性，知道亿万中国同志，特别是中国人民解放军每天都学习这篇文章时，我深深地感觉到，我们外国人更需要学习这篇文章。
    《纪念白求恩》一文，体现了当代马克思列宁主义的最高峰——毛泽东思想。群众可以从中得出一条指导世界革命斗争的正确路线。
    毛主席说：“列宁主义认为：资本主义国家的无产阶级要拥护殖民地半殖民地人民的解放斗争，殖民地半殖民地的无产阶级要拥护资本主义国家的无产阶级的解放斗争，世界革命才能胜利。”这点非常重要，应该成为我们每时每刻的座右铭，这不仅适用于几亿中国人民，也适用于各国人民。帝国主义和修正主义最怕全世界被压迫人民的革命团结。
    通过这篇文章的学习，中国人民树立了为革命而工作，把革命的利益放在第一位。这是中国牢固建立无产阶级专政，永不变色的重要保证。这些都给我们树立了榜样。
    我是新西兰人。现在我进一步地认识到，我们必须为我国的无产阶级与被压迫和被剥削的其他国家的无产阶级联合起来，为推翻美帝国主义和结束帝国主义的战争共同奋斗到底！我进一步认识到只有无产阶级革命才能使我国人民和世界其他各国人民获得自由与独立，这就是我的国际主义义务。
      应该以革命的态度对待革命工作
    阳早（美国）：很多年以前，当我第一次读毛主席的《纪念白求恩》这篇文章时，我的体会很肤浅。当时我想，白求恩同志的确是一个伟大人物。但我认为他的伟大在很大程度上，是由于客观环境所决定的。如果从事一般的平凡工作，就不可能有像白求恩同志那样的工作精神。
    多年以来，我对毛主席所说的白求恩同志“毫不利己专门利人”、“对工作的极端的负责任”、“对同志对人民的极端的热忱”，逐渐地有了比较深刻的认识。毛主席在这篇短文里，告诉了我们一个非常深刻的思想——什么是无产阶级世界观。我逐步地认识到，白求恩同志之所以能成为一个革命者，并不是由于他工作和生活的特殊环境，而主要是由于他的无产阶级世界观，正如毛主席说的“把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业”。我认识到，不管在何时、何地做何种工作，只要是对人民有益的，就是革命工作，我们就应该以革命的态度来对待这种工作，根本的问题在于我们的思想，而不在于客观环境。
    我已经在中国生活和工作了二十年。我大部分时间都生活在农村里。我来北京前，曾在一个国营农场工作。值夜班时常常发生一些问题：如半夜接到电话，说机器发生故障啦，牛病啦，牛奶消毒器坏啦……。这时我脑子里的自私自利思想就开始作怪了，“反正今晚天塌不下来！还是睡觉吧，明天再说。”而另外一种思想又促使我快去看看，究竟我能否帮点忙。在这样情况下我就和工人们一起干活，一干就是一夜。每当我们最后解决问题时，我就感到非常地幸福。因为白求恩同志一定会这样做，这也是毛主席希望我那样去做的。
    当中国的工人和农民知道我是一个美国人时，他们很快地就把我作为美国劳动人民的代表，把我和美帝国主义严格地区分开来。并向我表示热情的同志般的友谊。是什么精神能使七亿中国人民如此地仇恨帝国主义，而又如此热情地友好地对待一个普通的美国人呢？是什么精神使七亿中国人民把全世界被压迫人民的事业当作自己的事业呢？七亿中国人民生活和工作在中国，胸怀世界，这又是什么精神？这是国际主义精神，这是在毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党教导下七亿中国人民的共产主义精神。我认为，我们都应该认真地学习这种精神。
      决心努力使自己更接近于白求恩
    盐见敦郎（日本）：今年春天，我们日本人到周口店去参观，中午休息时，同去的有两名学龄前的儿童在休息室前的喷水池旁游玩，不留心掉到池子里去了。这时刚巧有位人民公社的年青的社员走过这里，毫不踌躇地跳进池子。等我们都聚集到池旁时，他已经把两个孩子救了出来。救孩子的中国同志认为，他只是做了一件应该做的事情。就很快地走开了。
    我相信我们大家一定不会把这样的事情仅仅归于中国人民个人的善良，而一定会清楚地意识到，这是已成为国家主人的中国人民的高度觉悟。而产生这一觉悟并使之提高的基础是毛泽东思想。
    我是为了参加中国的革命事业而从日本来的。在中国的所见所闻，使我们清楚地认识到，中国是高举马克思列宁主义旗帜，鼓舞全世界人民进行革命的根据地。我们确信参加中国的事业，就是世界共产主义者的国际主义任务。
    毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。我认为，支持高举毛泽东思想旗帜的中国社会主义革命和建设，是世界共产主义者的最重要的任务之一。我确信，只有这样才是我们贯彻无产阶级国际主义的唯一道路。我决心更加努力，使自己更加接近于白求恩。
      以“老三篇”来检查自己的思想行动
    洪若诗（英国）：跟白求恩一样，我也是一个外科医生。我希望，我能逐渐领会《纪念白求恩》这篇文章的全部含义并付诸于实践。有一天，我能与白求恩相比较，成为白求恩式的革命者，这就是我的雄心壮志。
    我在英国医院工作了十八年，多半是为工人治病。在这段时间里，我把自己当成一个革命者，认为自己对工作是相当负责的。但是，自从我到了中国，阅读了毛主席《纪念白求恩》的文章以后，我才怀疑自己：我真是像我过去认为的那样对工作相当负责吗？回想起来，我的责任感是有限的，不够的。
    两天以前，我给一个重病人（他是人民公社的贫协主任）作了切腿手术。这个手术有着非常大的危险性，要是在过去，我就会想，可别冒这个险，弄不好医生的名誉要受到毁坏。但是，由于学习了毛主席《纪念白求恩》一文，我想，如果我是极端负责的话，我就应该给他作手术。于是，我和同事们给他动了手术。现在我可以高兴地说，他经受住了这次手术。如果他能恢复健康，这是由于白求恩给我们树立了学习的榜样，这是毛主席《纪念白求恩》这篇文章给我们教导的结果。
    思想改造的问题是所有的革命者的基本问题，思想改造的第一步就是要毫无畏惧地以毛主席的“老三篇”为标准，对照检查自己的思想和行动。“老三篇”使我在争取成为白求恩式的共产党员的漫长的道路上才走了几步。我要一辈子走这条路。
        时时刻刻用白求恩来对照自己
    艾泼斯坦（美国）：无产阶级国际主义战士白求恩的声誉是早就被人所知的。但是他从来不摆架子，他并不是那种“出了一点力就觉得了不起，喜欢自吹，生怕人家不知道”的人。作为一个真正的共产党员，他总是到最艰苦、最危险的岗位上去工作，而拒绝享受特权。他有着一颗火热的心——这就是热爱同志，无私地为人民服务的心。
    我认为，这对我们中间那些年纪较大的，经历较长的因而处处以先生自居的人是一个教育。“摆老资格”是一种致命的疾病。从本质上说来，它是一种反动的东西。当然长期积累的经验可能非常宝贵。但是，只有当取得经验的人继续进步时，并使自己成为一个更加坚定的革命者时，那这种经验才有价值。这种价值的大小要由群众来决定，而不是自己来决定。我们应该时时地用白求恩来对照自己。
    毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。毛泽东思想已经给我们指出了一条同以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义作斗争的道路，指出了一条同以苏联领导集团为中心的修正主义作斗争的道路。要打败帝国主义，就必须反对以苏联领导集团为中心的修正主义。
    我们要为人民服务，就应该不断地改造自己，改进工作，改进作风，这样我们才能以我们的实际行动体现无产阶级国际主义；这样我们才能更加接近中国人民；这样才会对中国人民、对我们本国人民和世界人民作出有益的贡献。
    把白求恩的精神作为自己行动的榜样
    马尔丁斯（巴西）：毛主席说：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，每一个中国共产党员都要学习这种精神。”
    在国外工作的中国同志，他们就是按照毛主席的教导，以无产阶级国际主义精神和毫无利己的动机，把其他国家人民的事业当成自己的事业的。据新华社报道，中国帮助坦桑尼亚建设了一个强大的电台。在那里工作的中国同志住在工地的旧帐篷里，用废木头自己制成桌子、凳子。在烈日下每天至少工作十小时。只要遇到困难，他们就学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》和我们正在纪念的光辉著作——《纪念白求恩》，从中汲取力量。中国工人和专家把坦桑尼亚人民的事业当作自己的事业。坦桑尼亚人民和领导人认为这一切是比电台本身的设计更为重要的帮助。
    这些中国同志，给我们树立了一个随时随地把白求恩同志的精神变成行动的光辉榜样。
    巴西，拉丁美洲和其他殖民地、半殖民地以及未获得独立的国家的共产党员，应当同所有的资本主义国家的无产阶级联合起来。就像毛主席所说的，“才能打倒帝国主义，解放我们的民族和人民”。
    在今天的世界上，这种团结是建立在反对以美帝为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，反对他们的代理人——以苏联领导集团为核心的现代修正主义者的斗争的基础上。
    破“我”字，立“公”字，努力改造自己
    苏莱娅（坦桑尼亚）：我对阶级和阶级斗争的认识水平不高，但比我在来华前要高多了。我要感谢中国共产党、毛主席和中国人民，他们给了我最为迫切的教育。
    白求恩大夫的国际主义精神是为世界人民服务的精神。要成为像白求恩那样的人，需要经过长期的改造，首先要一步步破除“我”字，树立“公”字。
    白求恩同志从来不考虑个人利益，他非常热情，一心为别人，对他人非常负责，这就是这位共产主义战士的品质。我们应该向他学习。
    中国是大家学习的最好的学校。我们要向白求恩学习，要向走白求恩道路的英雄人物王杰、麦贤得学习。
      捍卫毛泽东思想，关心文化大革命
    莫利勒（法国）：学习了这篇文章后，我很受感动。每当我重读这一文时，没有一次不感动。学习白求恩的精神，就是说应该挖掉脑子里的个人主义根子。白求恩同志的榜样应该促使我们进行自我革命，把无产阶级的思想刻在我们的脑子里，以便能更好地参加革命的群众运动和反美斗争。学习白求恩精神应使我们奋起努力捍卫毛泽东思想和林彪的指示。我们应当更为关心无产阶级文化大革命。
    有毛泽东思想就能取得思想改造的胜利
    恩利格（哥伦比亚）：白求恩同志的共产主义精神就是扫除一切旧世界的障碍，树立了这样一个真理：阶级的恨和阶级的爱，对敌人的深仇大恨，对人民的无比热爱。
    我们正生活在进行社会主义建设和进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国。我们认为在任何时候，任何地方，在一切革命工作中都要贯彻发扬白求恩同志的精神。
    我来自资本主义世界。我懂得：要献身于无产阶级事业，就必须改造自己的世界观。建立无产阶级的世界观。思想改造的道路是长期的，困难的，有时是痛苦的。但是，有毛泽东思想，有白求恩同志的榜样和革命实践，我们的思想改造一定能取得胜利。
    带着阶级观点才能把毛泽东思想学到手
    马海德（美国）：《纪念白求恩》一文已经发表二十七年了。实践证明毛主席对马克思列宁主义作了伟大的发展，毛泽东思想是伟大的真理。它对中国革命和世界革命有卓越贡献。现在七亿中国人民都在学习毛泽东思想，这个运动也带动了我们思想革命化，我们要努力掌握毛泽东思想。
    白求恩同志是一位真正的无产阶级国际主义者，他总是在最困难的地方进行斗争。白求恩大夫热爱中国人民、中国共产党和毛主席，把中国的革命事业当作自己的事业。他从中国革命中看到世界革命，他来到中国就是为了从事世界革命。《纪念白求恩》一文，我读了许多遍，每一次都有新的体会，它帮助和鼓舞了我。我体会到只有按毛泽东主席的思想办事，才会取得进步。学习毛主席著作必须有无产阶级世界观，有阶级观点，否则学不到手。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，向我们每个人提出树立共产主义思想的任务，就像中国同志讲的那样，破“私”立“公”。这对于我们来说是十分重要的，对世界革命也是十分重要的。我们用什么纪念白求恩？就是学习他彻底破除“私”字，代之以“公”字。
        沿着白求恩的道路战斗到底
    莫尼克（比利时）：经常牢记白求恩这种毫不利己的献身精神，对于我们这些来中国工作的人是很重要的一课。我们应该自问：我们是否有勇气像白求恩那样为自己的信念奋斗到底？如果明天美帝国主义要发动起一场最后的战争，妄图与实现它的世界霸权（现代修正主义也想分享这个世界霸权）的障碍——中国决一死战，那时候，白求恩就会告诉我们应该怎样坚守岗位。
    白求恩一生毫无私心，大胆无畏。他昨天的战斗，也就是我们今天的战斗，我们要战斗到底，一直到世界人民最后掌握自己命运那一天为止。（附图片）
