	The Vice Minister of the News Department of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China.

	Three Soviet journalists should leave China.

	It was pointed out: For a long time, Soviet journalists stationed in China have consistently engaged in anti-China reporting to meet the needs of the Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-China stance. Recently, they have gone to great lengths to spread rumors and slander our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, providing a large amount of anti-China propaganda material for imperialism led by the United States. China absolutely cannot tolerate such activities that disrupt Sino-Soviet friendship and openly provoke our country.

	Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: Today, Chen Weifan, Vice Minister of the News Department of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, summoned Razdukhov, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China, and formally notified him that three out of the six Soviet journalists stationed in our country should leave China by December 25th.

	Vice Minister Chen Weifan pointed out during the meeting with Razdukhov, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China: For a long time, Soviet journalists stationed in China, in order to meet the needs of the Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-China stance, have taken advantage of the various conveniences provided by our government and people out of a desire to maintain friendship between the two peoples, and have consistently engaged in anti-China reporting. Especially in recent periods, they have gone to great lengths to spread rumors and slander our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Such rumors and slander have provided a large amount of anti-China propaganda material for imperialism led by the United States. We absolutely cannot tolerate such deliberate provocations and activities that disrupt Sino-Soviet friendship, and we absolutely cannot tolerate such open provocations against our country.

	Vice Minister Chen Weifan proposed: Based on the principle of reciprocity, the Soviet side has no reason to retain six journalists in China, while China only has three journalists in the Soviet Union. Therefore, three out of the six Soviet journalists stationed in our country should leave China by December 25th.

    我外交部新闻司副司长通知苏驻华临时代办
    苏联三名记者应离开中国
    指出：苏联驻华记者长期以来一贯进行反华报道，最近对我国无产阶级文化大革命极尽造谣诬蔑之能事，为以美国为首的帝国主义提供了大量反华宣传资料。中国绝对不能容忍这种破坏中苏人民友谊的活动和对我国的公然挑衅。
    新华社十六日讯我国外交部新闻司副司长陈维帆今天召见苏联驻华大使馆临时代办拉兹杜霍夫，正式通知他：苏联驻我国六名记者中的三名应在十二月二十五日以前离开中国。
    陈维帆副司长在召见苏联驻华大使馆临时代办拉兹杜霍夫时指出：长期以来，苏联驻华记者为了适应苏联修正主义领导集团反华的需要，利用我国政府和人民基于维护两国人民友好的愿望提供的各种方便，一贯进行反华报道，特别是最近一个时期，对我国无产阶级文化大革命极尽造谣诬蔑之能事。这种造谣诬蔑已经为以美国为首的帝国主义，提供了大量的反华宣传资料。我们绝对不能容忍这种蓄意挑拨和破坏中苏两国人民友谊的活动，绝对不能容忍对我国的公然挑衅。
    陈维帆副司长提出：根据对等原则，苏联方面没有理由在中国保留六名记者，中国在苏联的记者也只有三人。为此，苏联驻我国六名记者中的三名应在十二月二十五日以前离开中国。
