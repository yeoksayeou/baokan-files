	Chinese people from various sectors have been sending letters and telegrams to the Vietnamese Embassy to express their support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. The Vietnamese Embassy in China has written a letter of thanks.

	The following is the full text of the letter of thanks from the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam:

	After the American aggressors' barbaric bombing and strafing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the People's Republic of China has received a large number of telegrams and letters from various sectors and individuals in China, expressing their indignation at the savage aggression of American imperialism and their determination to thoroughly support the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist America and save the nation. This is a precious support for the Vietnamese people and a beautiful manifestation of the close combat friendship and interdependent relationship between the brotherly peoples of Vietnam and China.

	On this occasion, the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, on behalf of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Vietnamese people, would like to express our sincere and heartfelt gratitude to all the organizations, groups, and brothers and sisters in China who have written to us or come directly to our embassy to condemn American imperialism and support our Vietnamese people's just struggle. We wish that the fraternal combat friendship between our two peoples will be increasingly consolidated and developed.

    本报讯　越南民主共和国大使馆的感谢信，全文如下：
    最近在美国强盗轰炸、扫射越南民主共和国首都河内以后，越南民主共和国驻中华人民共和国大使馆收到了中国各界人民的集体和个人从各地寄来的大批电报和信件，对美帝国主义野蛮的侵略行动表示愤慨，并表示要彻底支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争事业。这是对越南人民宝贵的支持，是兄弟的越中两国人民亲密的战斗友谊和唇齿相依的关系的美好表现。
    借此机会，越南民主共和国驻华大使馆，谨代表越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和越南人民，向曾经给我们来信或直接到我们使馆来表示谴责美帝国主义和支持我们越南人民正义斗争的中国的各组织、各团体和兄弟姐妹们，表示真诚的、深切的谢意。祝我们两国人民兄弟般的战斗友谊日益巩固和发展。
    越南民主共和国驻华大使馆
