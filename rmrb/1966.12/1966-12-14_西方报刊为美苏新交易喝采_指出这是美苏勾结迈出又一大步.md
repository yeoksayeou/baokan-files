Western newspapers have enthusiastically praised the new deal between the United States and the Soviet Union on the so-called "peaceful use of outer space."

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on December 11, American and British newspapers have been extolling the agreement reached by the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the "treaty for the peaceful use of outer space."

The editorial in the December 10 issue of the *New York Times* acknowledged that the significance of the agreement between Moscow and Washington on signing a "treaty for the peaceful use of outer space" lies not in its prohibition of placing nuclear weapons in outer space, but in the fact that "Moscow and Washington were able to reach an agreement on this complex document within a few months."

The editorial also admitted that to describe such an agreement as a step towards "peace" and "disarmament" is deceitful, because "up to now, no one has proven that sending (nuclear) bombs into (space) orbits or placing them on celestial bodies has any military advantage."

The *Times* of London also expressed approval of the Soviet revisionists' intensified collusion with American imperialism. The newspaper said that this agreement is "a valuable step forward in the mutual collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union." The newspaper further stated that the conclusion of the agreement shows that the Soviet leaders are not hesitant to seek certain types of limited agreements with the United States due to the Vietnam War and the exposure and condemnation of their betrayal by China. "Now it seems that the prospect of realizing a non-proliferation (of nuclear weapons) treaty is obviously brighter."

The December 11 issue of the *Sunday Telegraph* in London also pointed out that the agreement reached by the Soviet Union with the United States shows that "despite the Vietnam issue, the Kremlin still insists on keeping the line of reconciliation with the White House open." This newspaper also pointed out that the Soviet side made significant concessions in the negotiations to reach this agreement.

### 西方报刊为美苏新交易喝采  指出这是美苏勾结迈出又一大步

    西方报刊为美苏新交易喝采
    指出这是美苏勾结迈出又一大步
    据新华社十一日讯美英报刊大肆吹捧美苏在所谓“和平利用外层空间”问题上作成的新交易。
    《纽约时报》十日的社论承认，美苏就签订一项“和平利用外层空间条约”达成的协议，其“重要意义主要不在于它禁止（把）核武器（置于外层空间），而在于”“莫斯科和华盛顿能在几个月内就这个复杂的文件达成协议”。
    社论还承认，把这样一个协议说成是有利于“和平”和“裁军”的步骤，那是骗人的，因为，“到现在为止，还没有任何人证明把（核）炸弹送入（空间）轨道或放在天体上，在军事上有任何好处。”
    伦敦《泰晤士报》对苏联修正主义者加紧同美帝国主义进行勾结的这种作法也表示赞赏。报纸说，这一协议是美苏在相互勾结方面“向前迈出的有价值的一步”。报纸还说，协议的达成表明，苏联领导人不愿由于越南战争以及中国对他们的叛卖行为的揭露和谴责“而缩手缩脚，而不敢去寻求同美国达成某些类型的有限协议。现在看来，实现一项不扩散（核武器）条约的希望显然是更光明了”。
    十一日的伦敦《星期日电讯报》也指出，苏联同美国达成的这一协议表明：“尽管存在越南问题，克里姆林宫仍然要求保持同白宫和解的线路畅通。”这家报纸并且指出，苏联方面为了达成这项协议不惜在谈判中作出了重大的让步。
