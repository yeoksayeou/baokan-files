Revolutionary youths visited Liu Hulan's hometown to tour revolutionary sites and a memorial hall, vowing to be as loyal to the revolutionary cause as the martyr and to harbor deep hatred for the enemy.

XINHUA, Taiyuan, Dec. 7 — Liu Hulan's hometown, Yunzhouxi Brigade in Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, recently received a large number of visiting revolutionary youths. Revolutionary youths from various places, after a long march on foot, arrived in Liu Hulan's hometown. They toured revolutionary sites and a memorial hall, paid tribute at the martyr's grave, and admired Chairman Mao's personal inscription for Liu Hulan: "Great in life, glorious in death." They vowed to learn from Liu Hulan's unwavering loyalty to the revolutionary cause, her deep hatred for the enemy, and her steadfast spirit in the face of the enemy's butcher's knife.

The story of Liu Hulan's martyrdom 20 years ago moved the hearts of the revolutionary youths. Many shed tears of indignation upon hearing about Liu Hulan's heroic death in the face of the enemy's guillotine. They swore, "We will study and fight like Liu Hulan, and face life and death like Liu Hulan." A long march team from the capital, before leaving the martyr's hometown and setting off on their journey, solemnly pledged at the martyr's grave: "We will take up the hero's gun, hold high the flag dyed red with the blood of the martyrs, walk the path the martyrs did not finish, complete the cause the martyrs did not complete, and strive for communism all our lives." Revolutionary youths from Inner Mongolia said: "We are the descendants of the revolution. The land won by the martyrs with their blood and flesh, we will defend with our blood and flesh. The red flag held by the older generation, we will hold high and pass it down, for generations to come."

Many revolutionary youths who marched on foot carried forward the revolutionary tradition, living, eating, and working with the poor and lower-middle peasants in the martyr's hometown. Many long march teams, upon arriving at their campsite, despite their fatigue from the journey, immediately helped the villagers cover their grain. A long march team from Hebei's Ba County, upon entering the village on the morning of November 12, immediately helped the villagers cover their grain when it started to rain. A long march team from Beijing, upon entering the village, put down their bags without resting and went to the fields to plow. They worked from 4 PM until 8 PM before returning. In addition to learning production techniques from the poor and lower-middle peasants, they also learned about the local revolutionary struggle history and the history of the poor and lower-middle peasants. They used the evenings to invite cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants for discussions, enriching their class struggle knowledge and learning from their experiences. The revolutionary youths encouraged themselves with Chairman Mao's teachings, vowing to be like Liu Hulan, achieving "great in life, glorious in death," and resolving to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

    学习刘胡兰的革命硬骨头精神
    革命小将到刘胡兰家乡参观革命遗址和纪念馆，决心像烈士那样，对革命事业无限忠诚，对敌人刻骨仇恨
    新华社太原七日电　刘胡兰烈士的故乡——山西省文水县云周西大队，最近接待了大批来访的革命小将。来自各地的革命小将们，经过徒步长征，来到刘胡兰的故乡，参观革命遗址和纪念馆，祭扫烈士墓，瞻仰毛主席给刘胡兰烈士的亲笔题字：“生的伟大，死的光荣”。他们决心学习刘胡兰烈士对革命事业无限忠诚，对敌人刻骨仇恨，在敌人屠刀面前脸不变色心不跳的革命硬骨头精神。
      刘胡兰二十年前为革命英勇牺牲的事迹，激动着革命小将们的心。不少人当听到刘胡兰烈士当年在敌人铡刀面前坚贞不屈从容就义的壮烈情景时，流下了悲愤的眼泪。他们立下誓言：“要像刘胡兰那样学习和战斗，要像刘胡兰那样对待生和死。”来自首都的一支长征队，当他们离开烈士故乡踏上征途前，在烈士墓前庄严宣誓：“我们要接过英雄的枪，高高举起先烈用鲜血染红的旗帜，走先烈没有走完的路，完成先烈没有完成的事业，为共产主义奋斗终生。”来自内蒙古的革命小将说：“我们是革命的后代，先烈用血肉换来的江山，我们一定用血肉来捍卫。老一辈手中的红旗，我们一定接过来，高高举起，传下去，千秋万代传下去。”
    不少徒步串连的革命小将，发扬革命传统，在烈士故乡和贫下中农同吃同住同劳动，虚心地向贫下中农学习。许多长征队一到宿营地，不顾征途疲劳，就和社员一起翻地，摘棉花，捆秸秆，担水，扫院。河北省霸县来的长征队，十一月十二日上午进村时，下起雨来，他们当即放下行李，帮助社员覆盖粮食。北京来的长征队一进村，放下背包不休息，就到地里翻地，从下午四时一直翻到晚上八时才回来。他们在劳动中除向贫农下中农学习生产技术外，还了解当地革命斗争史，贫下中农家史，并利用晚上时间，邀请干部和贫下中农举行座谈，丰富自己的阶级斗争知识，学习阶级斗争经验。革命小将们纷纷以毛主席的教导勉励自己，要像刘胡兰那样，做到“生的伟大，死的光荣”，决心跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
