Under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, in recent years, Chinese revolutionary literary and artistic workers have achieved remarkable results in their struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line. These achievements have been warmly praised and highly evaluated by friends from the five continents. They have seen in China's reforms of Peking Opera, ballet, symphonic music, and sculpture the heroic image of the revolutionary people of New China, the spiritual appearance of proletarian heroes, and the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They believe that these reform achievements have great world significance.

China's cultural revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, has set a shining example for the whole world.

The famous singer Ibrahim Dukiqi of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe, who visited China this year, was deeply moved after watching the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women." He said, "This is truly proletarian art, truly Marxist-Leninist art, truly Mao Zedong Thought art." Sri Lankan expert Pulei said, "The ballet 'The Red Detachment of Women' is very good. Whether in terms of content or form, it is a success. This is the result of implementing Chairman Mao's policy of revolutionization, nationalization, and popularization, and of art serving politics." Japanese Progressive Theater Troupe director Kawahara Kichijiro, after watching the Peking Opera "The Red Lantern," praised, "We watched your 'The Red Lantern,' and it was performed excellently. This is an indication of the development of China's Cultural Revolution. 'The Red Lantern' is a revolutionary flower born in the midst of China's Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao."

Many foreign revolutionary comrades and friends, while highly praising the brilliant achievements of China's cultural revolution, pointed out that all these achievements were made under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They said, Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line is the direction for the world's revolutionary literature and art, and the road that Chinese revolutionary literary and artistic workers are blazing is the road that all revolutionary literary and artistic workers in the world will take. Japanese Matsuyama Ballet Troupe director Seisuke Shimizu, after watching the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," told the Chinese performers, "You created the play with Mao Zedong Thought. 'The Red Detachment of Women' was created according to the spirit of Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.' Ballet is not just about watching the dance, but about seeing the ideology. Chinese ballet is highly ideological and a model of nationalization. In the future, one must come to China to learn ballet. We will also go deep among the masses and study Mao Zedong Thought when we return." Deputy Director Bu Xi of the Dance Group of the Lao Patriotic Front Cultural Troupe, after listening to the introduction of the ballet revolution, on behalf of everyone, expressed that the Chinese people develop art with Mao Zedong Thought, and we Lao people will also develop art with Mao Zedong Thought to serve the peasants, soldiers, and cadres. A member of the British Friendly Delegation to China thought that the modern Peking Opera has important significance for the world cultural revolution. He said, "I believe this will be a contribution to world culture. China will set an example for the world, especially for those countries influenced by British and American imperialist culture, and for Asian, African, and Latin American countries. For countries whose national culture has been destroyed, such as Greece, it is the same." Japanese famous actor Yoshiko Sugimura said, "Friends in the Japanese theater are very concerned about the issue of modern Peking Opera. The task of the actors on the front line is very heavy. They not only have to do well with Chinese theater but also set an example for the Japanese theater. Everyone's eyes are on the friends in the Chinese theater."

Foreign friends not only highly evaluated China's cultural revolution from a political perspective but also believed that a series of model works such as the Peking Operas "The Red Lantern," "Shajiabang," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "The Raid on the White Tiger Regiment," the ballets "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl," the symphonic music "Shajiabang," and the clay sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard" are also successful and outstanding in art. Chinese revolutionary literary and artistic workers have perfectly combined revolutionary content with the most perfect artistic form, reflecting the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, loved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and becoming a powerful tool for educating and inspiring the people.

A Vietnamese comrade highly praised the modern Peking Opera. He said, "This is the victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic policy. Modern Peking Opera has made many improvements in singing and speaking, and the audience can better understand the plot by looking at the actors' expressions."

Japanese-Chinese Friendship Association (orthodox) General Secretary Seiken Miyazaki said, "To be honest, I was doubtful about whether the reform of Peking Opera could succeed, but after watching the performance, I was relieved. You reformed it correctly and well. You not only retained the original characteristics of Peking Opera but also developed it in a new way." Congolese (Brazzaville) writers Lunda and Aba, who watched several modern Peking Operas in a row, said, "Several years ago, we watched Peking Opera in Paris. To be honest, we didn't like it because we wanted to understand the reality of New China from Chinese artworks, but Peking Opera was all about describing past life, which we revolutionaries could not accept. The French bourgeoisie liked it. This time we watched Peking Opera that reflects modern struggle life, and the characters in the play, who are enemies and who are friends, we Africans can understand without translation." A Japanese critic, after watching the performance of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," said, "Very good. I have heard that China is trying to give Peking Opera new themes to reflect modern life. After watching the performance, I was very enlightened. You have given new life to the old formulas. The scenes of skiing and climbing mountains all retain and develop the beauty of Peking Opera's acrobatics. This attempt is very successful. The action of swinging the rifle does not show any trace of wielding the green dragon saber. The exaggerated makeup of the big-faced character is very appropriate and harmonizes well with modern costumes. In short, everything exceeds my imagination." French Classical Ballet Troupe director Claude Chaudet, while praising the achievements of the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," said, "Chinese dancers successfully combined traditional Peking Opera dance movements with Western ballet, which is an outstanding creation." An Italian expert working in China said, "Italian ballet has degenerated, and Chinese ballet is developing in a new direction. Such good ballet should go to Europe and Italy to perform, and it will definitely cause a sensation throughout Europe and gain higher reputation than other art troupes." Argentine friend Valotta said, "The 'White-Haired Girl' is a revolutionary ballet, with superb acting skills, and the stage setting is incredibly good, with profound social significance. 'Swan Lake' of the Soviet Union is a symbol of the political and artistic stagnation of the Soviet Union." The great achievements of China's sculpture revolution, the clay sculpture group "The Rent Collection Courtyard," also made many foreign friends sigh in admiration.

Foreign friends saw that China's cultural revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the policy of emphasizing the present, using the past for the present, and using foreign elements for Chinese purposes, achieved great victories. They saw the broad masses of workers and peasants taking the stage, and were greatly inspired and educated. A Guatemalan playwright said, "There is no reason to obstruct the reform of theater. We should use socialist content to replace feudalist and capitalist content and let the new characters of the socialist era take the stage." Japanese Matsuyama Ballet Troupe director Seisuke Shimizu believed that ballet must reflect real life. He expressed that in the future, he would serve the Japanese people through extensive artistic activities and strive for the direction of revolutionization, nationalization, and popularization of ballet. Next time, he would bring works that are not afraid of difficulties and fight against American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries to visit and perform in China. A member of the Canada-China Friendship Association delegation, Danuelson, said, "In capitalist countries, we cannot see such theater because Western theater is all capitalist in nature, and so is the Soviet Union."

This year, the leader of the Vietnamese Cultural Delegation, Van Ngoc Tu, after watching the large-scale revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl," said, "This play is an education on class struggle, an education on hatred towards the enemy, and an education on raising ideology. 'This play is very successful and is a victory of China's Cultural Revolution. Our people regard China's victory as our own victory. We have the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese people as our backing, and our victory is also the victory of the Chinese people.'" After the performance, the leader presented three rings made from the wreckage of the first thousand enemy planes shot down to the responsible person and main performers of the performance troupe. Deputy Director Chan Nong Yintaphon of the Lao Patriotic Front Cultural Troupe deeply felt that due to class exploitation and oppression, the White-Haired Girl was produced, and because the exploiters and the exploited could not coexist, Xi'er went to the wilderness and had to take up arms to fight. A representative from Swaziland who attended the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers said, "This play made me realize how the Chinese people were exploited and oppressed in the past. Now the Chinese people have stood up; but such things are still happening in Swaziland. Watching this ballet, I felt a sense of power to fight for liberation. This play is like giving me a weapon." The Vietnamese Democratic Republic Song and Dance Art Troupe, while visiting the exhibition of the clay sculpture group "The Rent Collection Courtyard," many people cried from beginning to end while watching and listening, and some even wept uncontrollably. Leader Qu Huyen said, "Although the exhibits are clay sculptures, they are full of blood and flesh, and have great educational significance." Dance director Minh Chen said, "This is a good historical textbook that educates the younger generation to never forget class hatred and to establish a resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit. This has deep educational significance for us, so many of us were moved to tears." Soloist Bi Hong (from South Vietnam) cried, "After watching it, I thought of the people in South Vietnam who not only suffer from the oppression and exploitation of landlords but also from the trampling of imperialism. I am very grateful to the comrades for arranging such a good opportunity for us to be educated." She expressed that she would work hard when she returned and make contributions to the early liberation of her hometown.

    五大洲朋友热情赞扬我国文艺革命取得划时代的成就
    毛主席的文艺方向是世界革命文艺的方向
    新华社十二日讯　在毛主席文艺路线的光辉照耀下，近几年来我国革命文艺工作者在同反革命修正主义文艺路线斗争中取得的文艺革命成果，受到来自五大洲的朋友们的热情赞扬和极高的评价。他们从我国京剧改革、芭蕾舞剧改革、交响音乐改革和雕塑改革中，看到了新中国革命人民的英雄姿态，看到了无产阶级英雄人物的精神面貌，看到了毛主席文艺为工农兵服务的方向的辉煌胜利。他们认为，这些改革成果具有伟大的世界意义。
    中国文艺革命在毛主席文艺方向指引下取得的光辉成就，为全世界树立了一个榜样
    今年在我国访问演出的阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团著名歌唱演员依卜拉欣·都基齐，看了芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》后，激动地说，这是真正无产阶级艺术，是真正马列主义的艺术，是真正毛泽东思想的艺术。在中国工作的锡兰专家普瑞说：“芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》很好，不论从内容和形式来看，都是成功的，这是贯彻了毛主席的革命化、民族化、大众化和艺术为政治服务的方针的结果。”日本前进座剧团团长河原崎长十郎看了京剧《红灯记》后，赞扬说：“我们看了你们的《红灯记》，演得很精彩，这是中国文化大革命发展的说明。《红灯记》是毛主席领导的文化大革命中诞生的一朵革命鲜花。”
    很多外国革命同志和朋友们，在高度评赞我国文艺革命所取得的光辉成就时指出，所有这些成就，都是在毛主席文艺为工农兵服务的方向指引下取得的。他们说，毛主席的文艺方向，就是全世界革命文艺的方向，中国革命文艺工作者正在开辟的道路，也就是全世界革命文艺工作者将要走的道路。日本松山芭蕾舞团团长清水正夫看了革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》后，对中国演员们说：“你们是用毛泽东思想创作剧目的，《红色娘子军》就是按照毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》精神来创作的。芭蕾舞不只是看舞蹈，而是要看思想，中国的芭蕾舞是有高度思想性的，也是民族化的典范。以后学习芭蕾舞必须到中国来学。我们回去以后也要深入群众，学习毛泽东思想。”老挝爱国战线党文工团舞蹈组副组长布西在听了关于芭蕾舞革命经过的介绍之后，代表大家表示，中国人民发展艺术靠毛泽东思想，我们老挝人民也要靠毛泽东思想来发展艺术，为农民、广大士兵、干部服务。英国友好访华小组一位成员认为，京剧现代戏对于世界文化革命具有重要意义。他说：“我相信，这对世界文化会是一个贡献。中国将会为世界树立一个榜样，特别是对那些受英、美帝国主义文化影响的国家，对亚、非、拉美国家来说，更是这样。对于那些民族文化受摧残的国家，如希腊也是如此。”日本著名话剧演员杉村春子说：“日本戏剧界的朋友都很关心京剧演现代戏问题。站在第一线的（中国）演员们的任务很重大，不仅要把中国的戏搞好，同时也是日本戏剧界的榜样。人们的眼睛都在注视着中国戏剧界的朋友。”
    革命的内容和完美的形式结合起来，反映了工农兵的思想感情，为工农兵所热爱
    外国朋友们不仅从政治上对我国文艺革命的成就给予高度评价，而且认为京剧《红灯记》《沙家浜》《智取威虎山》《奇袭白虎团》，芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》《白毛女》，交响音乐《沙家浜》，泥塑《收租院》等一系列样板作品，在艺术上也是成功的，十分杰出的。中国的革命文艺工作者把革命的内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式，完美地结合起来了，反映了工农兵的思想感情，为工农兵所热爱，成为教育人民和鼓舞人民的有力工具。
    越南的一位同志对现代京剧很称赞。他说：“这是毛泽东文艺方针的胜利。现代京剧在唱腔方面有很多的改进，念白也好懂了，看了演员的表情，观众对剧情就更容易理解了。”
    日中友协（正统）总部理事长宫崎世民说：“老实讲，以前我对京剧的改革能否成功是有怀疑的，但看了演出，我放心了，你们改得对，改得好。你们不仅保持了京剧固有的特色，而且有了新的发展。”刚果（布）作家隆达和阿巴连续看了几出京剧现代戏，他们说：“好几年前，我们在巴黎看过京剧。老实说，我们都是不喜欢的，因为我们想从中国的艺术作品中了解新中国的现实生活，但是京剧却都是描写过去生活的，那种生活是我们不能接受的，所以我们革命者不喜欢。法国的资产阶级倒是喜欢的。这一回我们看了表现现代斗争生活的京剧，戏里面的人物，谁是敌人，谁是朋友，我们非洲人，不用翻译，都能理解。”日本的一位评论家看了《智取威虎山》的演出后说：“非常好。我早就听说中国在尝试给京剧以新的主题，反映现代生活，这次看了演出以后，很受教益。你们给旧的程式赋予了新的生命。剧中滑雪、登山等场面，都保持并发扬了京戏翻打的美的特色，这个尝试是非常成功的。舞动步枪的动作，一点也看不出有挥舞青龙大刀的痕迹，大花脸夸张很适当，与现代服装配合在一起，一点也没有不调和的感觉。总之，一切都超出了我的想像。”法国古典芭蕾舞团团长克劳德·基劳德在赞扬芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的成就时说：“中国舞蹈家们成功地把传统的京剧舞蹈动作与西洋芭蕾舞揉合起来，这是一种出色的创造。”在我国工作的一位意大利专家说：“意大利的芭蕾舞已经颓废，中国的芭蕾舞向新的方向发展，这样好的芭蕾舞应该到欧洲和意大利演出，它一定会轰动整个欧洲，会比其他的艺术代表团获得更高的声誉。”阿根廷朋友瓦洛塔说：“《白毛女》是革命的芭蕾舞，演技高超，布景是令人难以想像的好，具有深远的社会意义。”“苏联的《天鹅湖》则是苏联政治和艺术僵化的象征。”我国雕塑革命的伟大成果泥塑群像《收租院》在艺术上的成就也使得许多外国朋友赞叹不止。
    让社会主义时代的新人物登上舞台，使各国革命人民受到极大的鼓舞和教育
    外国朋友们看到我国文艺革命在毛主席的为工农兵服务的方向和厚今薄古、古为今用、洋为中用的方针指导下获得了伟大胜利，看到了广大工农兵登上戏剧舞台，受到了极大的鼓舞和教育。危地马拉一位剧作家说：“没有理由来阻碍戏剧改革，应该用社会主义内容来代替封建主义、资本主义的内容，让社会主义时代的新人物登上舞台。”日本松山芭蕾舞团团长清水正夫认为，芭蕾舞必须反映现实生活。他表示，今后要通过广泛的艺术活动为日本人民服务，为芭蕾舞走向革命化、民族化、群众化方向而努力。下次将带着不怕困难，同美帝国主义和日本反动派作斗争的作品再来中国访问演出。加拿大—中国友好协会代表团团员丹纽森说：“在资本主义国家里，我们不可能看到这样的戏剧，因为西方的戏剧都是资本主义性质的，苏联也是如此。”
    今年上半年来我国进行访问的越南文化代表团团长范玉纯，看了大型革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》以后说：“这个剧是阶级斗争的教育，对敌人仇恨的教育，提高思想的教育。”“这个剧演得很成功，是中国文化大革命的胜利。我国人民把中国的胜利视作自己的胜利。我们有中国共产党、毛主席和中国人民作后盾，我们的胜利也是中国人民的胜利。”演出结束后，团长把三枚用打落的第一千架敌机的残骸做成的戒指赠给演出团负责人和主要演员。老挝爱国战线党文工团副团长占农·因塔冯深有体会地说，由于阶级剥削和压迫产生了白毛女，又因为剥削者与被剥削者不能共处，喜儿到了荒山上去，而且只好拿起枪杆进行斗争。出席亚非作家紧急会议的斯威士兰的一位代表说：“这个剧使我知道了过去中国人民是怎样受剥削受压迫的。现在中国人民站起来了；可是，这种事情在斯威士兰还在发生。看了这个舞剧，我感到产生了一种力量，去争取解放。这个剧等于给了我武器。”越南民主共和国歌舞艺术团在参观《收租院》泥塑群像展览中，好多人从始至终流着眼泪在看、在听，甚至有的泣不成声。团长瞿辉瑾看后说：“展品虽是泥塑，但它有血有肉，教育意义很大。”舞蹈编导陈明说：“这是很好的历史教材，教育年轻一代，使他们永远不忘记阶级恨，树立起坚决、彻底的革命精神，这对我们来说，教育意义也很深，所以我们好多人被感动得流出眼泪。”独唱演员碧红（越南南方人）哭着说：“看了后，使我想到越南南方人民不但在遭受地主的压迫剥削，而且还遭受着帝国主义的蹂躏。我非常感谢同志们给我们安排这样一个好的受教育机会。”她表示，回去后，一定努力工作，为家乡早日解放作出贡献。
