During the Korean War of 1952, our unit was stationed on the front lines of Kumch'on. The enemy, relying on their superior technology and equipment, used the flat and open terrain of the valley in our central position to their advantage, allowing them to deploy large numbers of tanks. They repeatedly launched probing attacks, their arrogance knowing no bounds. At the time, we had only a few small-caliber, short-range infantry anti-tank weapons. Facing the enemy's superior equipment and aggressive posture, how could we destroy their tanks and hold our position? This question was urgently before us.

Chairman Mao said, "The outcome of a war is mainly determined by the military, political, economic, and natural conditions of the two sides. This is undeniable. However, it is not just that. It is also determined by the subjective leadership capabilities of the two sides." From Chairman Mao's teachings, we understood that we must not only see the objective factors such as weapons and terrain but also the subjective factors such as the political consciousness and initiative of the people. Terrain is static, but people are dynamic. If the terrain is unfavorable, we can change it. The enemy relies on firepower but fears close combat. We cannot match the enemy in firepower; we must outdo them in politics and bravery. We unanimously advocated moving our positions into the valley to engage the enemy in close combat and "fight the enemy's tanks with bayonets."

Moving to the open ground presented the greatest challenge in terms of concealment and maneuverability. Initially, due to our lack of experience, we only extended our fortifications into the valley. The enemy's tanks came a few times. We found that if we were too far away, we couldn't hit them, and if we were too close, we couldn't maneuver to a favorable shooting position to effectively destroy the enemy's tanks. At this point, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, not to be "reckless and rash," but to be "brave and wise heroes." By mobilizing the masses to think of solutions and find strategies, based on the characteristics of both sides, we identified their patterns, avoided harm, and innovated. Relying on the wisdom and strength of the masses, we constructed a network of anti-tank fortifications that were crisscrossed and interconnected, and we built trenches on both sides of the valley. Once the enemy's tanks broke through, we could move everywhere, use cover everywhere, and shoot everywhere. We could quickly, at the closest range, and with the most effective angle, decisively and bravely fight back. Truly, when the enemy shoots at us, they can't hit us; when we shoot at them, we hit them, hit them accurately, and destroy them.

On June 13, more than 20 American tanks, supported by two infantry companies, attacked our position. As soon as the enemy tanks entered our minefield, one was blown up by a mine. Our anti-tank teams, hidden in the trenches, quickly and stealthily entered the position. When the rocket launcher team led by Wang Mingshan took up their firing position at the forefront, the enemy's leading tank had already fiercely charged into our position. Wang Mingshan's team aimed at the second tank and fired a shot. With a loud explosion, the enemy tank caught fire. At this moment, the third tank pressed forward towards Wang Mingshan's team. Wang Mingshan's team quickly and cleverly moved along the trench to one side and fired another shot, disabling its track. The first tank that had charged into our position was also destroyed in our front and rear pincer attack. After the enemy's consecutive failures, the following tanks dared not advance and wildly fired their cannons from their original positions. Our anti-tank heroes, seeing that the enemy tanks did not dare to advance, braved the dense artillery fire, crossed the damaged trenches, and charged forward to "fight the enemy tanks with bayonets," destroying and damaging three more enemy tanks. The remaining tanks, fearing annihilation, fled in disarray. After about two hours of intense battle, we suffered no casualties and achieved the glorious results of destroying and damaging six enemy tanks, capturing one, and killing or wounding a portion of the enemy, capturing four enemy tank soldiers including a deputy platoon leader.

    做勇敢而明智的英雄
    李长林
    一九五二年抗美援朝战争中，我部守卫在金城前线。敌人凭着它技术装备的优势，利用我阵地中央的谷地地势平坦、开阔，便于大量使用坦克的有利条件，不断向我进行试探性的攻击，气焰十分嚣张。我们当时只有为数极少的、口径小、射程短的步兵防坦克火器。面对优势装备、气势汹汹的敌人，怎样歼灭其坦克，守住阵地？这个问题尖锐地摆在我们的面前。毛主席说：“战争的胜负，主要地决定于作战双方的军事、政治、经济、自然诸条件，这是没有问题的。然而不仅仅如此，还决定于作战双方主观指导的能力。”从毛主席的教导中，我们认识到：不仅要看到武器装备、地形条件等客观的因素，更要看到人的政治思想、自觉能动性等主观的因素。地形是死的，人是活的。地形不好，可以改变。敌人依仗的是火力，害怕的是近战；我们不能和敌人比火力，要和敌人比政治、比勇敢。我们一致主张把阵地设置到谷地中间去，和敌人打近战，和敌人的坦克“拚刺刀”。
    到平地去打，最大的困难是不便于隐蔽机动。开始，由于我们没有经验，只是将工事伸展到谷地中间。敌人坦克来了几次。我们发现远了打不到，近了又不能机动到有利的射击位置，有效地消灭敌人坦克。这时，我们遵循毛主席的教导，不做“乱撞乱碰的鲁莽家”，要做“勇敢而明智的英雄”。通过发动群众想办法，找对策，根据敌我特点，找出它的规律，趋利避害，破旧创新。我们依靠了群众的智慧和力量，构成了纵横交错、四通八达的步兵防坦克网状阵地，并在谷地两侧构筑了坑道。一旦敌人坦克突入，我们到处都有堑壕可运动，到处都有掩体可利用，到处都能射击，能以最快的速度，最近的距离，最有效的射角，坚决、勇敢地打。真正是，你打我时，叫你打不到，摸不着；我打你时，就要打上你，打准你，吃掉你。
    六月十三日，美军坦克二十多辆，配合两个步兵连，向我阵地攻击。敌坦克一进入我雷区，即触雷炸毁一辆。隐蔽在坑道内的我各防坦克小组迅速、隐蔽地进入阵地。当位于最前沿的汪明山火箭筒小组占领好射击位置时，敌先头坦克已凶猛地冲入我阵地。汪明山小组对准第二辆打了一炮，“轰”的一声响，敌坦克就烧起来了。这时，第三辆对着汪明山小组猛压过来。汪明山小组机智迅速地沿壕绕至一侧，又是一炮，打断了它的履带。最先冲入我阵地的第一辆坦克，也在我前后夹击中被消灭。敌接连失败后，后续的坦克不敢前进，在原地猖狂炮击。我打坦克的英雄们，见敌人坦克不敢前来，就冒着浓密的炮火，穿过残缺的战壕，迎上前去，和敌坦克“拚刺刀”，又击毁、击伤敌坦克三辆。其余坦克害怕被歼，狼狈逃窜。约经两小时的激烈战斗，我无一伤亡，取得了击毁、击伤敌坦克六辆，缴获一辆，击毙、击伤敌一部、活捉敌坦克副连长以下四人的光辉战绩。
    从这次战斗中看出：坦克，这个身披钢甲、有枪有炮、气势汹汹的“庞然大物”，看样子很厉害，其实并不可怕，不过是只
  “纸老虎”。只要认识了敌我双方的情况，找出了行动的规律，发挥我政治上的优势，勇敢，不怕死，敢于抵近到它跟前去，和它“刺刀见红”，不但能把它打碎、打烂，还能把它活捉。
