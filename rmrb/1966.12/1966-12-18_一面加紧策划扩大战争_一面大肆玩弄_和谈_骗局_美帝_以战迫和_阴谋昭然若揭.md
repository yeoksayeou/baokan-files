	While Intensifying Plans to Expand the War, the U.S. Empire is Also Brazenly Playing the "Peace Talks" Trick; the U.S. Empire's "War to Force Peace" Conspiracy is Exposed

	New York, December 17 (Xinhua) - Washington: The U.S. State Department spokesman has repeatedly made statements in recent days, denying the heinous crimes of the U.S. repeatedly bombing Hanoi and the serious provocation of bombing the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam. At the same time, the Johnson administration continues to plot the bombing of Hanoi and the expansion of the Vietnam War, intensifying the implementation of the "war to force peace" conspiracy. This fully exposes the banditry and hooliganism of the Johnson administration.

	Facing the strong protests of the American people and the people of other countries around the world against this new act of aggression by U.S. imperialism, State Department spokesman McCloskey, at press conferences on the 14th and 15th, repeatedly denied the fact that U.S. bandit planes had continuously bombed the city of Hanoi. Under repeated questioning by reporters, he had to resort to sophistry, saying, "I don't know how people define the city area." On the 16th, after the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement strongly protesting the U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, McCloskey, in answering reporters' questions, still clung to a "statement" from the U.S. Department of Defense, claiming that the claim that U.S. planes had bombed the city of Hanoi was "unfounded." The hooligan tactics of Washington officials fully reveal the banditry of U.S. imperialism and their shameful, guilty appearance.

	At the same time, the war clamor and the conspiracy to expand the war in the United States have been increasing.

	The Associated Press's chief correspondent in Washington, Heitow, on the 15th, quoted U.S. government officials as saying that the Johnson administration plans to "ignore the international (protest) storm" and, according to "military needs," continue to bomb Hanoi. On the 16th, Johnson convened a "high-level meeting" with officials directly involved in the Vietnam War to discuss the "progress" of the Vietnam War. It is reported that the meeting discussed the issue of sending U.S. troops into the Mekong Delta for a long time. On the same day, the U.S. head of the Vietnam War, Westmoreland, in Manila, shouted: "Greater efforts are needed in South Vietnam," and expressed the intention to recruit more cannon fodder from U.S. vassal states to be thrown into the Vietnam War. Johnson's senior advisor on the Vietnam War, former U.S. "ambassador" to Saigon, Taylor, made speeches on the 14th and 16th, blatantly advocating to continue the Vietnam War until the Vietnamese agree to "peace talks."

	Taylor's speech fully exposed the Johnson administration's evil intention of "war to force peace." In fact, U.S. imperialism is on the one hand crazily expanding the war, and on the other hand brazenly playing the "peace" conspiracy. While the Johnson administration is rallying its henchmen to vigorously advocate extending the Christmas "ceasefire," a powerful figure in the U.S. ruling class, Senate Democratic leader Mansfield, on the 13th, made a speech advocating that the U.S. government propose a "suggestion" for both sides to "ceasefire and stand still" in South and North Vietnam to "seek some reconciliation." On the 14th, White House spokesman Moyers immediately publicly stated that Johnson would "happily consider" Mansfield's proposal in any discussion. He also boasted that the U.S. is prepared to discuss the extension of the Vietnam "ceasefire" and the "freeze" on increasing troops, "if the other side is willing to engage in such talks." It is reported that the "high-level meeting" on the 16th also discussed the "prospects for a peaceful resolution (of the Vietnam issue)." After the meeting, an official said: "The U.S. is still willing to discuss the issue of long-term ceasefire."

	However, whether it is the "escalation" of the war or the "escalation" of the "peace talks" deception, it cannot save U.S. imperialism from the fate of failure in South Vietnam. This, the U.S. ruling class also has to admit. Johnson, on the 15th, at the ceremony of lighting the White House Christmas tree, said with a worried heart: "We are facing an uncertain future. Serious problems threaten us all," and the U.S. "days ahead will not be easy." He asked the American people to continue to "make sacrifices" for the Vietnam War. The U.S. Secretary of the Air Force, Brown, who has been crazily advocating the expansion of the war, lamented: the Vietnam War is "a more difficult war than the Korean War." The recently resigned special assistant to the president for national security affairs, McGeorge Bundy, in an article on the 15th, also admitted that the hope of defeating the Vietnamese people is "extremely wrong," and the future of U.S. troops in Vietnam is "to continue to make sacrifices."

### 一面加紧策划扩大战争  一面大肆玩弄“和谈”骗局  美帝“以战迫和”阴谋昭然若揭

    一面加紧策划扩大战争  一面大肆玩弄“和谈”骗局
    美帝“以战迫和”阴谋昭然若揭
    新华社十七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人连日来一再发表谈话，矢口抵赖美国接连轰炸河内的滔天罪行和轰炸中国驻越南大使馆的严重挑衅行为；与此同时，约翰逊政府却继续策划轰炸河内和扩大侵越战争，加紧推行“以战迫和”阴谋。这就充分暴露了约翰逊政府的强盗行径和流氓嘴脸。
    面对着美国人民和世界其他各国人民对于美帝国主义这一新的侵略罪行的强烈抗议，美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基在十四、十五两日的记者招待会上，一再抵赖美国强盗飞机连续轰炸河内市区的事实，在记者的一再追问下，他竟不得不乞灵于诡辩术，说什么他“不知道人们是怎样对市区下定义的”。十六日，中国外交部发表声明，强烈抗议美机轰炸中国驻越南大使馆之后，麦克洛斯基在答记者问时，仍然死死抱住美国国防部的一个“声明”不放，胡说什么美国飞机轰炸河内市的说法是“没有根据的”。华盛顿官方的这种流氓手法充分显露了美帝国主义强盗的一副作贼心虚的狼狈相。
    在这同时，美国的战争喧嚣和策划扩大战争的阴谋活动却有增无已。
    美联社驻华盛顿首席记者海托华十五日引美国政府官员的话说，约翰逊政府打算“不顾国际上的（抗议）风暴”，根据“军事需要”继续轰炸河内。十六日，约翰逊召集同侵越战争直接有关的官员举行了一次“高级会议”，讨论侵越战争的“进展”。据透露，会议就派美军侵入湄公河三角洲的问题“讨论了很久”。同一天，美国侵越头目威斯特摩兰在马尼拉叫嚷：“在南越需要作出更大的努力”，并且表示要从美国的仆从国搜罗更多的炮灰投入侵越战争。约翰逊进行侵越战争的高级顾问、美国前驻西贡“大使”泰勒在十四日和十六日接连发表谈话，赤裸裸地鼓吹要把侵越战争进行到越南人同意“和谈”为止。
    泰勒的谈话和盘托出了约翰逊政府“以战迫和”的罪恶企图。实际上，美帝国主义正在一边疯狂扩大战争，一边大肆玩弄“和平”阴谋。在约翰逊政府纠集它的帮凶走卒起劲地鼓吹延长圣诞节“停火”的时候，美国统治集团中有势力的人物、参议院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德十三日又发表谈话，主张美国政府提出圣诞节后双方在南北越“停火和原地不动”的“建议”，以便“求得某种和解”。十四日，白宫发言人莫耶斯立即公开表示：约翰逊将“高兴地在任何讨论中”考虑曼斯菲尔德的建议。他并且扬言：美国准备讨论延长越南的“停火”和“冻结”增加部队的问题，“如果对方愿意进行这种会谈的话”。据报道，十六日的“高级会议”也讨论了“和平解决（越南问题）的前景”。会后，官方人士重申：“美国仍愿讨论长期停火问题”。
    但是，无论是战争“升级”还是“和谈”欺骗“升级”，都挽救不了美帝国主义在南越的失败的命运。这一点，美国统治集团也不得不承认。约翰逊十五日在点燃白宫圣诞树的仪式上就忧心忡忡地说：“我们面临着捉摸不定的未来。严重的问题威胁着我们大家”，美国“今后的日子将不是容易的”。他要美国人民为侵越战争继续“作出牺牲”。一向疯狂叫嚣扩大战争的美国空军部长布朗哀叹：侵越战争“是一场比朝鲜战争更为棘手的战争”。刚刚辞职的总统国家安全事务特别助理麦·邦迪，十五日在一篇文章中也承认，美国指望打败越南人民“是极端错误的”，侵越美军的前途是“继续作出牺牲”。
