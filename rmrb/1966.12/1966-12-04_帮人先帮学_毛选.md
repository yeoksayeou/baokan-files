Yang Denshan is a model; he always carries the "Three Articles" with him. He studies before work and applies what he learns during work, thoroughly transforming his worldview. When he has shortcomings, he dares to expose them; he takes the lead in pulling carts and digging rivers. He lets others have the honor and takes the lead in facing difficulties. When he sees someone lagging behind, he helps them, helping others by helping them study "Selected Works of Mao." Taking heroes as examples, he continues to work even after getting injured. Everyone praises him for studying and applying the "Three Articles" in real life.

    帮人先帮学“毛选”杨登坡是模范，随身带着“老三篇”；工前学，工中用，彻底改造世界观。有了缺点他敢亮，拉车挖河带头干；荣誉方便让别人，有了困难抢在先。见了后进他就帮，帮人先帮学“毛选”。以英雄为榜样，负了工伤坚持干。活学活用“老三篇”，人人称他是模范。
