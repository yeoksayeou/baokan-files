During the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a team of instructors for studying Chairman Mao's works emerged in the rural areas of Ningxia's Ninxia County. This team, consisting of over 3,500 people, is spread throughout the county's communes and production brigades. They are the backbone of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

Most of these instructors are young members of poor and lower-middle peasant households. During the socialist education movement, they heard the poor and lower-middle peasants, as well as their own parents, denounce the bitterness of the old society and praise the sweetness of the new society. They came to understand more deeply what class is and what exploitation is, and they grew to hate the old society even more while loving the new society. Their hearts were filled with boundless love for our great leader, Chairman Mao. As instructor Yang Fazhi put it, "The debt of gratitude to our parents is deep, but the debt of gratitude to Chairman Mao is the deepest. Thinking of the past and looking at the present, without Chairman Mao's wise leadership, how could we poor and lower-middle peasants have today's life?"

Many instructors, with such deep class sentiments, guide the poor and lower-middle peasants in their studies. Instructor Qing Yulian of the 11th Brigade voluntarily lived with the peasant He Yufang, helping her read the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's quotations every day. Under Qing Yulian's guidance, He Yufang made rapid progress in her studies and was selected to attend the second session of the Autonomous Region's Militia Representatives Conference. Instructor Kang Peng of the 6th Brigade saw that some young people in the brigade were not united, so he organized them to study Chairman Mao's works according to Chairman Mao's teaching that "All revolutionary comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other," uniting the youth.

Instructors go deep into the poor and lower-middle peasant households to hold study and application meetings.

The representatives of the Jiangxi Jiujiang Military Sub-district's active members in studying Chairman Mao's works, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching that "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and getting close to the workers and peasants, can one truly learn," walked to Jiujiang County's Xingang Commune. They ate, lived, worked, and entertained with the poor and lower-middle peasants, holding meetings to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, exchanging experiences with each other.

The representatives saw the poor and lower-middle peasants' deepest class sentiments, strongest learning willpower, and most vivid and moving deeds in studying Chairman Mao's works. For example, Li Renyou, a poor peasant from Xingang Forest Farm, followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "One must be extremely responsible to one's work and extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people," and when a female cook asked for maternity leave, he took on the tasks of cooking and raising pigs, doing the work of three people. When the farm workers went to the fields to work, he would take the time to wash their shoes, socks, and clothes, not afraid of dirt or hard work. When he was sick in the hospital, he insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works and also helped the nurse sweep the floor, empty the spittoons, and wash the clothes of the patients. When others thanked him, he always said, "If you want to thank someone, thank Chairman Mao, it is he who taught me to do this."

Such examples were very vivid and inspiring to the representatives. They resolved to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles" thoroughly, to make a revolution in the depths of their souls.

Every village and hamlet is adorned with shining red quotations from Chairman Mao.

One day, a poor peasant woman from the fifth production brigade of Liqi Township's Xihe Brigade in Yunnan Province's Yuxi Basin sent her 12-year-old daughter, Zhang Cunfen, to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy salt. However, the girl returned home with a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" instead. It turned out that Zhang Cunfen had long wanted a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." That day, when she went to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy salt, she saw the peasants crowded around buying "Quotations from Chairman Mao," so she used the money her mother gave her to buy salt to purchase a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." When she returned home, her mother asked her why she didn't buy salt. The girl happily said, "Mother, it's okay to go a day without salt, but how can we go without studying Chairman Mao's works!"

Similar examples of loving Chairman Mao's works can be seen everywhere in the harvest-rich Liqi Commune. Now, the walls of every village and hamlet are adorned with large red slogans such as "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought" and "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao." The homes of the broad masses of commune members are decorated with shining red quotations from Chairman Mao, and couplets praising the Party and Chairman Mao are written on the door thresholds. People carry Chairman Mao's works with them and study them whenever they have time. Everywhere, the air is thick with politics, and everywhere, the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines.

The workers of the photography industry in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, have been responsible for printing the great leader Chairman Mao's photographs since the beginning. They insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works every day and in everything, taking Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding principle.

Before going to work every day, they always study Chairman Mao's quotations with questions in mind. Many workers also made plaques with Chairman Mao's quotations and placed them on their workbenches as mottos. Most of the members of the developing and printing group lacked experience in printing news photographs, and after five or six attempts, the quality still did not meet the requirements. Some individuals were a bit discouraged. At this time, everyone studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties, we strive for victory." They also reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings that "failure is the mother of success" and "learning from mistakes." Everyone gained courage and said that no matter how great the difficulty, they must print the great leader Chairman Mao's photographs well. After repeated research and trials, they finally succeeded.

At present, they have printed nine types of high-quality photographs of Chairman Mao, which have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses.

    大学毛主席著作  大立毛泽东思想
    文化大革命高潮中出现的辅导员队伍
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，宁夏中宁县农村出现了一支学习毛主席著作辅导员队伍。这支队伍由三千五百多人组成，遍布全县各社队。他们是活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的骨干。
    这些辅导员，大多是贫农下中农青年社员。在社会主义教育运动中，他们听到贫农下中农和自己的父母控诉旧社会的苦，畅谈新社会的甜，更加懂得了什么是阶级，什么是剥削，更加痛恨旧社会，热爱新社会，心中充满对我们最伟大的领袖毛主席的无限热爱。正像辅导员杨发智所说：“父恩母恩，毛主席的恩情最深。想想过去，看看现在，没有毛主席的英明领导，那会有我们贫农下中农的今天。”
    许多辅导员都是怀着这样深厚的阶级感情，辅导贫农下中农学习的。十一队辅导员邢玉玲，主动和社员贺玉芳住在一起，每天帮助她读“老三篇”和毛主席语录。在邢玉玲的帮助下，贺玉芳通过活学活用毛主席著作，思想进步很快，被选为出席自治区第二次民兵代表会议的代表。六队辅导员康鹏，看到队上一些青年人闹不团结，就按照毛主席的“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，组织大家学习毛主席著作，把青年团结起来了。
    深入到贫农下中农里面去召开讲用会
    江西九江军分区学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议的代表，遵照毛主席关于“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到”的教导，步行到九江县新港公社，与贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同娱乐、同开活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，互相交流经验。
    代表们看到了贫下中农学习毛主席著作的最深厚的阶级感情、最坚强的学习毅力、最生动感人的事迹。比如新港林场贫农李仁友，遵照毛主席关于“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的教导，在一个女炊事员请产假时，主动地把做饭和养猪的担子挑起来，一个人做三个人的事。林场职工下地生产，他就抽空给他们洗鞋子、洗袜子、洗衣服，不怕脏、不怕累。他有病住院时，坚持学习毛主席著作，并且帮助护理员扫地、倒痰盂，给病友洗衣服。当别人感谢他时，他总是说：“要感谢，就感谢毛主席吧，是他老人家教我做的。”
    这样的事例，对代表们是很生动的教育和鼓舞。他们决心响应林彪同志的号召，狠学狠用“老三篇”，在灵魂深处闹革命。
    村村寨寨贴满红光闪闪的毛主席语录
    一天，云南省玉溪坝子李棋公社下赫大队第五生产队的一个贫农妇女，叫十二岁的女儿张存芬到供销社去买盐巴。可是，这位小姑娘回家交给她母亲的却是一本《毛主席语录》。原来，小存芬早就想有一本《毛主席语录》了。那天，她到供销社去买盐巴，看到社员们正挤着买《毛主席语录》，便用妈妈给她买盐巴的钱买了《毛主席语录》。回到家里，妈妈问她咋个不买盐巴，小姑娘高兴地说：“妈妈，一天不吃盐巴不要紧，不学毛主席著作怎么行呀！”
    类似这样热爱毛主席著作的事例，在丰收后的李棋公社到处可以看到。如今，村村寨寨的墙壁上，都写着“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁”，“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁”等大红标语。广大社员家里贴上了红光闪闪的毛主席语录，门沿上也书写了歌颂党和毛主席的对联。人们把毛主席著作随身带，一有空就学起来。真是处处洋溢着浓厚的政治空气，处处闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。
    把毛泽东思想作为自己行动的指针
    浙江省杭州市的照相业职工，从开始负责印制伟大领袖毛主席的照片以来，就坚持天天、事事活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想作为自己的行动指针。
    在每天上班前，他们总是带着问题学习毛主席语录。很多职工还精制了毛主席语录牌，放在自己的工作台上，作为座右铭。冲晒组的大部分同志缺乏印制新闻摄影照片的经验，试印了五、六次，质量都不合要求。个别同志有点泄气了。这时，大家便学习毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”并重温了毛主席关于“失败者成功之母”、“吃一堑长一智”的教导。大家增加了勇气，都说，天大的困难也不怕，一定要把伟大领袖毛主席的照片印好。经过一次又一次研究试印，终于试印成功。
    目前，他们已印制了九种质量比较好的毛主席照片，受到广大群众热烈欢迎。
