We warmly welcome the song and dance troupe of the Romanian Socialist Republic's army to come to our country for a friendly visit and performance.

Last year, from October 27 to November 16, the song and dance troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army visited the Romanian Socialist Republic. In Bucharest, Constanta, Galati, Brasov, Sibiu, and other five cities, they conducted friendly visits and performances, receiving enthusiastic welcome and hospitality from the Romanian people, government, and military. They visited the achievements of the Romanian working people in building socialism under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, adhering to the principle of independence and self-reliance. Through their performances, they introduced revolutionary songs and dances to the broad Romanian audience. During the visit, we had several friendly meetings with the officers and soldiers of the Romanian armed forces. In Bucharest, we also met with all the members of the Romanian Socialist Republic's army song and dance troupe and enjoyed some of their singing and musical performances.

One year later, at a time when our country is in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and when the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is being achieved, the Romanian army song and dance troupe is invited to visit our country for a one-month friendly visit and performance. We are very pleased about this.

The Romanian army song and dance troupe was established in early 1947 and is now one of the largest and best song and dance art troupes in Romania. It has a male chorus, a dance troupe, a symphony orchestra, a folk orchestra, and solo and solo performance groups, totaling more than 200 people. In 1952, this troupe visited our country and left a deep impression on the Chinese people and our military personnel with their enthusiastic and richly national and folk-style songs and dances.

The members of the Romanian army song and dance troupe are visiting our country again. They will have extensive contact with the people of our country, the People's Liberation Army, and the Red Guards, and can conduct on-the-spot investigations of our unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and our industrial and agricultural production. This will certainly help to deepen the mutual understanding between the two countries' peoples and armies, further strengthening the friendship and unity between the peoples and armies of the two countries.

    热烈欢迎罗马尼亚军队歌舞团
    李伟
    我们热烈欢迎罗马尼亚社会主义共和国军队歌舞团来我国进行友好访问演出。
    去年十月二十七日至十一月十六日，中国人民解放军歌舞团访问了罗马尼亚社会主义共和国，在布加勒斯特、康斯坦察、加拉茨、布拉索夫、锡比乌等五个城市进行了友好访问演出，受到罗马尼亚人民、政府、军队的热情欢迎和接待，参观了罗马尼亚劳动人民在罗马尼亚共产党领导下本着独立自主的方针建设社会主义的成就，通过演出，把我国的革命歌舞节目，介绍给广大的罗马尼亚观众。访问过程中，我们同罗马尼亚武装部队的官兵同志们进行了数次友好的会见，在布加勒斯特，我们还会见了罗马尼亚社会主义共和国军队歌舞团的全体同志，欣赏了他们的部分歌唱、音乐节目。
    一年之后的今天，正在我国无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，正当以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得伟大胜利的时候，罗军歌舞团应邀来我国作为期一个月的友好访问演出，我们感到非常高兴。
    罗军歌舞团成立于一九四七年初，现在是罗马尼亚最大的、最好的歌舞艺术团体之一。它拥有男声合唱队、舞蹈队、交响乐队、民间乐队和独唱独奏小组，共二百多人。一九五二年，这个团曾访问过我国，他们以其热情洋溢的、富有民族、民间色彩的歌舞节目，给我国人民和我军指战员留下了深刻的印象。
    罗军歌舞团的同志们再次访问我国，将同我国人民、人民解放军、以及红卫兵小将们广泛接触，可以对我们正在轰轰烈烈进行的、史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命和我国的工农业生产，作实地的考察。这必定会有助于两国人民、两国军队之间的互相了解，进一步增强中罗两国人民、两国军队之间的友谊和团结。
