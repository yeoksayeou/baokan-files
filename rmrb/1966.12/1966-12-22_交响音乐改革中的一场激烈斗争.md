For a long time, under the control and influence of the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line of Zhou Yang, some anti-revolutionary revisionists in the music world, under the pretext of "introducing foreign heritage," have been peddling capitalist black goods, allowing foreigners and the dead to dominate the stage.

The revolution in Peking opera in 1964 was like a clap of spring thunder that awakened us. If such an old opera genre as Peking opera can be reformed, why can't symphony music? No, symphony music must be reformed, must be revolutionized, must end the situation where foreigners and the dead dominate the stage, and must let the protagonists of our times, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, take the stage in symphony music. Symphony music must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve proletarian politics. At this critical moment, Comrade Jiang Qing came to our Central Orchestra, bringing the boundless concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. She gave us an important speech, pointing out that we must not follow the foreigners to death, but must walk our own path. She also specifically suggested that we should base ourselves on the Peking opera "Shajiabang" and transform and transplant it into symphony music. The revolutionary masses of the orchestra were overjoyed after hearing this. However, a small clique of those in power within the old Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, and the Central Orchestra who were taking the capitalist road fiercely resisted. They first used the tactic of "delay," and it was only with great difficulty that they managed to assign two people to work on it, and even then, they let it go unsupervised and unmanaged. In this way, they dragged it out for three whole months. Due to the struggle of Comrade Jiang Qing and the revolutionary masses of the orchestra, seeing that the situation was not in their favor, they had to hurriedly start the project. At this time, they played a new trick, attempting to bring the symphony "Shajiabang" into their "track." The anti-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang said: "What you are doing is very necessary, but you must consider your methods." Lin Mohan also chimed in: "You must develop your own characteristics," "You must take two steps, the first step is to rely more, the second step is to develop." What kind of "development" are they pursuing? The person in charge of the Art Bureau of the old Ministry of Culture gave a specific explanation: "Your 'Shajiabang' is not a sample, nor is it a waste product, it is a trial product. In the future, it can be developed into pure music!" They truly revealed their intentions, wanting to drag revolutionary symphony music back onto the bourgeois "pure music" path.

A small clique of those in power within the Central Orchestra who were taking the capitalist road faithfully carried out this anti-revolutionary revisionist line, colluding with anti-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang and Lin Mohan, and creating all kinds of obstacles and sabotage for the creation and performance of the symphony "Shajiabang." Some bourgeois academic "authorities" also shouted wildly: "I don't work on 'Shajiabang,' but that doesn't mean I'm a counter-revolutionary." "I just disagree with performing Peking opera, and I'd rather be a conservative." The revolutionary comrades in the orchestra wanted to learn Peking opera, but the leadership did not provide the conditions; they wanted to rehearse, but there were no actors; they wanted to perform, but there were no costumes. However, the clouds can never cover the sun. Under the leadership and support of Comrade Jiang Qing, the broad revolutionary masses of the orchestra finally won the struggle. The symphony "Shajiabang" met with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and received their enthusiastic welcome and high praise. This is a victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, a great victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought.

After the symphony "Shajiabang" achieved success, the anti-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang again stretched out his black hand. He said: "The key is to combine." "Combining foreign things with Chinese national things will produce new things." "The Central Orchestra performing 'Shajiabang' is combining foreign things with our national opera." Zhou Yang's so-called "combination" is in opposition to Chairman Mao's instruction on "using foreign things for Chinese use" and "replacing the old with the new." He removes class nature and denies that "new" must "replace the old," attempting to use the symphony "Shajiabang" to peddle his reactionary theory of "fusion of Chinese and Western cultures."

In the great Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the broad revolutionary masses have exposed all the anti-revolutionary revisionists of the old Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, and the old Beijing Municipal Committee. Their heinous crimes must be thoroughly settled. We must, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end and build the Central Orchestra into a highly proletarianized and highly combative revolutionary orchestra!

    交响音乐改革中的一场激烈斗争
    中央乐团　普兵
    长期以来，在周扬反革命修正主义文艺黑线的控制和影响下，音乐界一些反革命修正主义分子，借口“介绍外国遗产”，大肆贩卖资本主义的黑货，让洋人、死人统治着舞台。
    一九六四年的京剧革命，像一声春雷震醒了我们，京剧这样一个老剧种都能改革，交响音乐难道就不能吗？不，交响音乐一定能改革，一定要革命，一定要结束洋人、死人统治舞台的局面，一定要让我们时代的主人公工农兵登上交响音乐的舞台。交响音乐一定要为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务。正在这个时候，江青同志来到了我们中央乐团，带来了党中央和毛主席对我们的无限关怀。她对我们作了重要的讲话，提出不能跟着洋人去死，一定要走自己的路，并且具体建议我们在京剧《沙家浜》的基础上把它加工和移植成交响音乐。乐团革命群众听了以后，都欢欣鼓舞。可是，旧中宣部、旧文化部和中央乐团的一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派却拚命抵制。他们开始是采用“拖延”的手法，好容易才抽出两个人搞搞，也是放任自流，不加过问，就这样整整拖了三个月。由于江青同志和乐团革命群众的斗争，他们见势不妙，才不得不匆匆上马。这时，他们又玩了一个新花招，企图把交响音乐《沙家浜》纳入他们的“轨道”。反革命修正主义分子周扬提出：“你们这样搞，学过来很必要，但要照顾到你们的方法。”林默涵也跑出来说：“要发挥各自的特点”，“要分两步走，第一步多依靠，第二步发展。”他们所追求的“发展”是什么呢？旧文化部艺术局的负责人则作了具体的解释：“你们这个《沙家浜》不是样品，也不是废品，是个试制品。将来可以发展为纯音乐嘛！”真是不打自招，他们就是要把革命的交响音乐拉回资产阶级的“纯音乐”的道路。
    中央乐团内的一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，忠实贯彻执行了这一条反革命修正主义路线，同周扬、林默涵等反革命修正主义分子勾结在一起，对交响音乐《沙家浜》的创作和演出百般刁难，采用了许多手段进行阻挠破坏。一些资产阶级的学术“权威”也猖狂叫嚷：“我不搞《沙家浜》，也不能说我是反革命。”“我就是不同意搞京戏，宁愿做个保守派”等等。乐团的革命同志要学京戏，领导上不给条件；要排练，不给演员；要上演，不给服装。但是乌云终究遮不住太阳，乐团广大革命群众在江青同志的领导、支持下，终于取得了斗争的胜利。交响音乐《沙家浜》和广大工农兵群众见面了，得到了他们的热烈欢迎和高度赞扬。这是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是毛泽东文艺思想的伟大胜利。
    当交响音乐《沙家浜》获得成功以后，反革命修正主义分子周扬又伸出了黑手。他说：“关键在于结合。”“外国东西和中国民族东西相结合，就会出新东西。”“中央乐团演《沙家浜》，就是把外国的东西，跟我们的民族戏曲相结合。”周扬的所谓“结合”，是和毛主席关于“洋为中用”“推陈出新”的指示相对抗的，他抽掉了阶级性，否认“出新”必须“推陈”，企图利用交响音乐《沙家浜》来贩卖他那反动的“中西合流”的谬论。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命群众把旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委的反革命修正主义分子统统揪出来了。对他们所犯下的滔天罪行，必须彻底清算。我们一定要在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把中央乐团建设成为一个非常无产阶级化非常战斗化的革命乐团！
