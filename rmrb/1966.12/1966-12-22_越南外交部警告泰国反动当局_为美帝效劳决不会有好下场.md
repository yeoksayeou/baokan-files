Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Warns Thai Reactionary Regime: Serving the U.S. Imperialists Will Not End Well

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 21st: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on December 20th, strongly protesting the Thai reactionary regime's provision of military bases to U.S. imperialism and its criminal actions of serving the U.S. aggression against Vietnam.

The statement revealed that since the Manila Conference, the Thai authorities have further intensified their collusion with the U.S. aggressors, sending cruisers, landing craft, and naval forces to South Vietnam to directly participate in combat alongside U.S. troops and their puppet armies. More seriously, the Thai authorities have conspired with the United States to hasten the plot to station B-52 strategic bombers at the U-Tapao base in Thailand.

The statement expressed full support for the statement issued by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's External Liaison Committee on December 14, 1966, regarding this incident. It firmly demands that the Thai authorities must withdraw all Thai mercenary troops from South Vietnam; must immediately stop the U.S. from using Thai bases to bomb and strafe both South and North Vietnam; and must immediately halt the plan to station U.S. B-52 aircraft in Thailand.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sternly warns the Thai authorities: if they continue to stubbornly allow the U.S. to use Thai territory as a springboard for aggression against the Vietnamese people and the people of Indochina, they will have to bear the heavy responsibility of expanding the war crisis in this region and will inevitably suffer the same fate of failure as their masters.

    越南外交部警告泰国反动当局
    为美帝效劳决不会有好下场
    据新华社河内二十一日电　越南民主共和国外交部二十日发表声明，强烈抗议泰国反动当局向美帝国主义提供军事基地，为美国侵越战争效劳的罪恶行动。
    声明揭露说，自从马尼拉会议以后，泰国当局又进一步加紧同美国侵略者勾结，增派巡洋舰、登陆艇和海军到越南南方，直接参加美国军队及其走狗军队的作战。更严重的是，泰国当局竟然伙同美国加紧策划把B—52型战略轰炸机进驻泰国乌塔保基地的阴谋。
    声明表示完全支持越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会一九六六年十二月十四日就这个事件发表的声明。坚决要求泰国当局必须把泰国帮凶军全部撤出越南南方；必须立即让美国停止使用泰国的基地对越南南北两方进行轰炸、扫射；必须立即停止推行让美国B—52型飞机进驻泰国的计划。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府严厉警告泰国当局：如果它仍然顽固地让美国使用泰国领土作为反对越南人民和印度支那人民的侵略跳板，它就必须承担扩大这个地区的战争危机的重大责任，必定遭到同它的主子一样的失败命运。
