History is created by the people, but on the old stage (in all literature and art that is divorced from the people), the people are reduced to mere dregs, while the stage is ruled by masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being overturned by you, restoring history to its true face. From now on, old dramas have a new life, and this is worth celebrating.

Our most beloved Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for them and used by them."

Our country's first revolutionary ballet, "The Red Detachment of Women," is a result of implementing Chairman Mao's instructions. Its birth is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a victory for Jiang Qing and our revolutionary comrades in adhering to Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, and resolutely fighting against the revisionist literary and artistic black line led by Zhou Yang. As Jiang Qing comrade said, the reform of ballet is a breakthrough of numerous difficulties and obstacles. From the "Swan Lake" of foreign talents and beauties to the revolutionary "Red Detachment of Women," it has undergone a serious class struggle.

The old Propaganda Department and the old Ministry of Culture, led by Zhou Yang and Lin Mo-han, have long controlled our troupe, resisting and opposing Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to turn our troupe into a tool for preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. They promoted tales of talents and beauties, gods and demons in ballet, spreading the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. We are young actors who graduated from school, grew up in a new society, love the Party, and love Chairman Mao. We want to follow Chairman Mao's words and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, after joining the troupe, we performed Western ancient palace myths every day, wearing silk and satin. Is this kind of work serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving proletarian politics? Every time we study the "Three Articles" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," we always raise such questions, but we cannot explain it ourselves, feeling very distressed. We strongly requested the leadership to go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for tempering and reform, and to perform small-scale programs reflecting the lives and struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. At this time, the leaders of the institute and the troupe brought out Zhou Yang and Lin Mo-han's fallacies to deceive and corrupt us, saying things like, "Our profession is indirectly serving," and "Our division of labor is to do foreign things, so we must do it thoroughly and create a name for it." They not only used this nonsense to deceive us but also, under the pretext of professional characteristics, cut off our contact with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, depriving us of the right to learn from them. In essence, they were afraid of us getting close to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, afraid of us mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and even blocked Chairman Mao's two important instructions to the literary and artistic circles in 1963 and 1964. However, no matter how much they fear, how much they plot and shoot dark arrows, they cannot stop the wheel of history, cannot stop the torrent of the proletarian cultural revolution, and cannot cover up the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

In December 1963, Comrade Jiang Qing suggested and personally helped us with the ballet reform, guiding us to walk the path of Mao Zedong Thought and create new art. We were particularly excited and moved by this news. We must walk the path that no one has walked before. Due to the long-term control and poisoning of the old Propaganda Department and the old Ministry of Culture, some of us thought that the revolutionization and nationalization of ballet were still distant, and we lacked ideological preparation for the imminent reform. Some comrades even had a sense of difficulty. However, when we understood the principle of "foreign for domestic use" and "ancient for modern use" proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao, we immediately became clear-headed and full of energy, determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

The revolution of ballet encountered fierce resistance and sabotage from the beginning by the anti-revolutionary revisionists Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, and Zhao Tuo. Comrade Jiang Qing suggested that we create "The Red Detachment of Women" to propagate Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war, which had significant educational significance at that time in the international and domestic situation. However, the anti-revolutionary revisionist Lin Mo-han played a trick of substituting beams and pillars, wanting us to create "Daji and Her Father," full of so-called human emotions. Despite his repeated insistence, it did not succeed due to the opposition of the majority of the creation team.

In the discussion of the script for "The Red Detachment of Women," a new struggle began. Lin Mo-han emphasized the need to focus on one person and one event, saying that this had dramatic effect, attempting to turn a theme that expresses the great thoughts of people's war into a biography that praises individual heroes. Comrade Jiang Qing insisted on highlighting Mao Zedong Thought and the principle of political standards first. She pointed out: We must write well about people's war, not only about the women's detachment but also about the male Red Army. With their joint struggle, the revolution in Hainan Island has always been a red flag that does not fall; we must write about the heroic image of the revolutionary class, write about Qinghua's deep hatred, and create a typical proletarian warrior. Comrade Jiang Qing also suggested adding scenes such as the Red Guards distributing grain to the people to show the relationship between the army and the people, especially emphasizing the need to highlight the leadership of the Party and the growth process of Qinghua's thoughts... Every point of her opinion first focuses on political thought, focusing on form serving content. Comrade Jiang Qing's extremely responsible and selfless spirit in creating revolutionary plays has greatly educated each of us.

During the rehearsals, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, and their lackeys used various excuses to obstruct and harass us, preventing us from going to the troops for in-depth life experience. Finally, under the strong demand of the revolutionary masses, they reluctantly allowed us to go to the platoon. But they only gave us ten days, and also kept the directors at home, letting them fantasize behind closed doors. This group of anti-revolutionary revisionists either distorted or twisted some important opinions of Comrade Jiang Qing, and completely ignored the opinions raised by the masses many times. They played a fake "three-in-one" and a true "one-man show," with everything decided by Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, and a few reactionary "authorities." However, the great Mao Zedong Thought is invincible. The revolutionary masses of the troupe actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, drawing endless strength from Chairman Mao's works, gradually realizing the profound significance of the ballet revolution we are engaged in. Especially Comrade Jiang Qing firmly implemented Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies and fought unyieldingly against Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, and their group, "The Red Detachment of Women," this epoch-making revolutionary ballet was finally born.

Our sun in the heart, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, watched "The Red Detachment of Women" on the evening of October 8, 1964. Chairman Mao enthusiastically encouraged us, saying: "The direction is correct, the revolution is successful, and the art is also good." Chairman Mao's words are like a bright lamp, illuminating the bright path of the revolutionization of ballet, making our confidence more firm. In the future, no matter what difficulties and obstacles we encounter, we will firmly follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and strive to the end!

The small group of anti-revolutionary revisionists in the old Propaganda Department and the old Ministry of Culture hated the success of "The Red Detachment of Women" to death and cursed it endlessly. On the day after Chairman Mao watched "The Red Detachment of Women," Lin Mo-han rushed to our troupe, shouting: "The Red Detachment of Women' is an infant in swaddling clothes, and the modern Beijing opera is a child in diapers." Zhou Yang slandered "The Red Detachment of Women" as a "shameful daughter-in-law who cannot be seen." The former director of the theater, the anti-revolutionary revisionist Zhao Tuo, even more maliciously said about "The Red Detachment of Women": "It is a steamed bun that has not come out of the oven." In 1965, they took the opportunity of the complete revision and improvement of the whole play to carefully hatch a new conspiracy. They used Comrade Jiang Qing's criticism of the troupe's work to direct the spearhead at the masses, completely denying the achievements of "The Red Detachment of Women"; and hastily "designed and improved" by drawing a large number of "experts" from other art units, changing the play beyond recognition. In the end, it was still under the encouragement and help of Comrade Jiang Qing that we completed the revision work and smashed their conspiracy.

Now, "The Red Detachment of Women" has become a brilliant model for ballet reform. Every performance is warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. While those who attempted to attack and strangle "The Red Detachment of Women," such as Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, and Zhao Tuo, have exposed their ugly faces like "Southern Tyrant." We will pursue victory, thoroughly settle the accounts of these anti-revolutionary revisionists, and forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carrying the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

    打倒妄图扼杀《红色娘子军》的“南霸天”
    中央歌剧舞剧院芭蕾舞剧团　齐向红
    历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目，从此旧剧开了新生面，所以值得庆贺。  毛泽东
    我们最敬爱的毛主席教导我们说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”
    我国第一个革命的芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，就是贯彻执行毛主席指示的成果。它的诞生，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是江青同志领导我团革命同志坚持毛主席的文艺路线，与周扬修正主义文艺黑线进行坚决斗争的胜利。正像江青同志所说的那样，芭蕾舞剧的改革，是冲破了重重的困难和阻挠搞起来的。从洋才子佳人的《天鹅湖》到革命的《红色娘子军》，经历了一场严重的阶级斗争。
    旧中宣部、旧文化部以周扬、林默涵为首的一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，长期把持着我们剧团，抵制和对抗毛泽东思想，企图把我团变成为资本主义复辟做舆论准备的工具。他们在芭蕾舞剧目上大搞才子佳人、神仙妖怪，散布封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的毒素。我们是从学校里毕业出来的青年演员，生长在新社会，热爱党、热爱毛主席。我们要听毛主席的话，为工农兵服务。但是我们来到剧团以后，整天演的是西方古代的宫史神话，穿的是绫罗绸缎。难道这样的工作就是为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务吗？每当学习“老三篇”和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》时，我们总是提出这样的问题，但自己又无法解释，心里很苦闷。我们向领导强烈要求到工农兵群众中去锻炼改造，要求排演中小型反映工农兵生活斗争的节目。这时，院、团领导便搬出周扬、林默涵那一套谬论，来蒙蔽和腐蚀我们，胡说什么：“我们的专业就是间接服务的”呀，什么“我们的分工是搞洋的，就要洋到底，洋出个名堂来”呀。他们不但用这一派胡言欺骗我们，还借口专业的特点，隔绝我们与工农兵的联系，剥夺我们向工农兵学习的权利。实质上他们是害怕我们接近工农兵，害怕我们掌握毛泽东思想，甚至连毛主席一九六三、一九六四年两次对文艺界的重要批示，都对我们实行封锁。但是，不管他们怎么怕，怎么耍阴谋、放暗箭，终究阻挡不住历史的车轮，阻挡不住无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，掩盖不住毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。
    一九六三年十二月江青同志建议，并亲自帮助我们进行芭蕾舞的改革，引导我们走毛泽东思想的大道，创造崭新的文艺。我们听了这个消息，心情特别兴奋、激动。我们一定要走前人没走过的路。由于多年来旧中宣部、旧文化部的控制和毒害，我们有一些人认为芭蕾舞革命化、民族化，还是遥远的事情，对马上要进行的改革缺乏思想准备，有的同志还有着畏难思想。但是，当我们领会了伟大领袖毛主席提出的“洋为中用”“古为今用”的原则，立即心明眼亮，浑身是劲，立志要遵照毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    芭蕾舞剧的革命，一开始就遭到来自周扬、林默涵、赵沨等反革命修正主义分子的顽固抵抗和疯狂破坏。江青同志建议我们搞《红色娘子军》，宣传毛主席的人民战争的思想，在当时的国际国内形势下是有重大教育意义的。而反革命修正主义分子林默涵却耍了偷梁换柱的阴谋，要我们搞充满所谓人情味的《达吉和她的父亲》。尽管他再三坚持，但是由于大多数创作人员的反对而没有得逞。
    在讨论《红色娘子军》剧本的过程中，新的斗争又开始了。林默涵强调要搞一人一事，说这样有戏剧性，企图把一个表现人民战争伟大思想的题材，搞成一个宣扬个人英雄的传记。江青同志始终坚持突出毛泽东思想，坚持政治标准第一的原则。她指出：一定要写好人民战争，不仅要写娘子军，还要写男红军，有了他们的共同战斗，海南岛的革命才一直是红旗不倒；要写出革命阶级的英雄群像，写出清华的苦大仇深，塑造一个无产阶级战士的典型。江青同志还建议增加赤卫队给群众分粮等情节以表现军民关系，特别强调了要突出党的领导和清华思想成长的过程……她的每一点意见，都首先着眼于政治思想，着眼于形式服从内容。江青同志对搞革命戏极端的负责任和废寝忘食的精神，使我们每个同志受到很大的教育。
    在排练过程中，周扬、林默涵和他们的走卒，又千方百计地抵制和刁难，以各种借口阻拦我们到部队去深入生活。最后，在革命群众的强烈要求下，才迫不得已让我们到连队去。但又只给我们去十天时间，并且把编导人员留在家里，让他们关起门来空想。这一小撮反革命修正主义分子对江青同志的一些重要意见，不是篡改就是歪曲，对群众多次提出的意见更是根本不听。他们耍了假“三结合”，真“一言堂”的手腕，一切都是周扬、林默涵一伙和几个反动“权威”说了算。但是，伟大的毛泽东思想是不可战胜的。剧团革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，从毛主席的著作里吸取无限的力量，逐步认识到我们所从事的芭蕾舞革命的深远意义。尤其是江青同志坚决执行了毛主席的文艺方针，同周扬、林默涵一伙进行了坚决的不屈不挠的斗争，《红色娘子军》这个划时代的革命芭蕾舞剧终于诞生了。
    我们心中的红太阳、我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，在一九六四年十月八日晚上，观看了《红色娘子军》。毛主席热情鼓励我们说：“方向是对的，革命是成功的，艺术上也是好的。”毛主席的话，像一盏明灯，照亮了芭蕾舞革命化的光明大道，使我们的信心更坚定了。今后无论碰到什么艰难险阻，我们都要坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的方向奋斗到底！
    旧中宣部、旧文化部一小撮反革命修正主义分子，对《红色娘子军》的成功恨得要死，骂个不休。就在毛主席看过《红色娘子军》的第二天，林默涵就迫不及待地赶到我们团里，大叫大嚷：“《红色娘子军》是襁褓里的婴儿，京剧现代戏是穿开裆裤的小孩。”周扬污蔑《红色娘子军》是“见不得人的丑媳妇”。剧院前院长、反革命修正主义分子赵沨更恶毒地说《红色娘子军》：“是个还没出笼的窝窝头”。一九六五年，他们又趁全剧修改加工的机会，煞费苦心地搞了一个新阴谋。他们借江青同志对剧团工作的一些批评，把矛头指向群众，全盘否定《红色娘子军》的成绩；又从其他艺术单位中抽来大批“专家”，匆匆忙忙地“设计加工”，把这个戏改得面目全非。最后还是在江青同志的鼓励和帮助下，我们完成了修改工作，粉碎了他们的阴谋。
    现在，《红色娘子军》成了芭蕾舞改革的光辉样板，它的每次演出，都受到广大工农兵群众的热烈欢迎。而妄图攻击扼杀《红色娘子军》的周扬、林默涵、赵沨之流，却暴露了他们像“南霸天”那样的丑恶嘴脸。我们要乘胜追击，彻底清算他们这一伙反革命修正主义分子的罪行，永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
