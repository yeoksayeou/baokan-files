The U.S. imperialists are sending their 9th Infantry Division to South Vietnam to serve as a gambling chip in their escalation of the war. The first batch of troops from this division has already landed in South Vietnam.

According to reports from Western news agencies, over 1,400 soldiers from the first batch of the U.S. 9th Infantry Division landed in the South Vietnamese city of Da Nang on the 19th. The remaining troops of this 15,000-strong infantry division will arrive in South Vietnam over the next few weeks. Once the entire division is in place, the U.S. ground forces in South Vietnam will consist of seven full divisions and four brigades. The Associated Press reported that sending this division to South Vietnam will allow "U.S. infantry units to be deployed in the Mekong Delta in the near future," further expanding the U.S. aggression in South Vietnam.

According to reports, the number of U.S. invading troops in South Vietnam has already exceeded 370,000.
