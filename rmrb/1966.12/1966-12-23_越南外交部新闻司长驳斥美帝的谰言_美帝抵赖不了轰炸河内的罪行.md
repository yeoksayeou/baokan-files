Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Refutes U.S. Imperialist Lies
U.S. Cannot Deny Its Crime of Bombing Hanoi

New China News Agency, Hanoi, December 22 — On December 22, Vu Dinh, Director of the News Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, held a press conference to severely refute the shameless lies of U.S. imperialism, which has repeatedly denied the crime of U.S. bandit planes continuously bombing the city of Hanoi.

He pointed out that although the U.S. authorities are trying to use sophistry to exonerate the U.S. air bandits, the barbaric crimes they have committed against the people of Hanoi are irrefutable and cannot be denied or covered up.

Vu Dinh listed a large number of facts about the continuous barbaric bombing of the city of Hanoi by U.S. bandit planes, and pointed out that the U.S. bandits not only continuously bombed and strafed the three towns of Vinh Dien, Gia Lam, and An Dinh in the suburbs of Hanoi, but also bombed and strafed all four districts of Hanoi, including the diplomatic quarter. The U.S. bandits' blatant acts of aggression not only violated the sovereignty and independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam but also constituted an extremely arrogant provocation to all peace-loving countries and peoples of the world.

Vu Dinh pointed out that recently, the U.S. authorities have been propagating the so-called "conditional cessation of bombing," "de-escalation of the war," and "conditional withdrawal of troops" and other "peace talks" arguments. However, the U.S.'s frenzied bombing of Hanoi shows that it has taken an unprecedented "escalation" step in the Vietnam War. The "peace talks" arguments of the Johnson clique are merely a deceptive means used by the U.S. bandits to cover up their new "escalation" steps in the Vietnam War, attempting to use bombs to shake the anti-American, national salvation spirit of the Vietnamese people and force the Vietnamese people to surrender to them.

Vu Dinh emphasized that the Vietnamese people love peace very much, but this must be a genuine peace of independence and freedom.

He said that the Vietnamese people are determined to carry out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's sacred call for resistance against the Americans and national salvation, to overcome hardships and sacrifices, to defeat the U.S. aggressor bandits, and they will definitely defeat the U.S. aggressor bandits.

    越南外交部新闻司长驳斥美帝的谰言
    美帝抵赖不了轰炸河内的罪行
    新华社河内二十二日电　越南民主共和国外交部新闻司司长吴田二十二日举行记者招待会，严厉驳斥美帝国主义最近一再抵赖美国强盗飞机连续轰炸河内市罪行的无耻谰言。
    他指出，尽管美国当局竭力进行诡辩，妄图为美国空中强盗开脱罪责，但是它对河内市人民所犯下的野蛮罪行，铁证如山，是绝对抵赖和掩盖不了的。
    吴田列举了美国强盗飞机连续野蛮轰炸河内市的大量事实之后指出，美国强盗不仅连续对河内市郊文典、嘉林、安沿三个市镇进行了轰炸和扫射，而且还对包括外国使馆区在内的河内市所有四个区进行轰炸和扫射。美国强盗这种明目张胆的侵略行动，不仅侵犯了越南民主共和国的主权和独立，而且是对各个爱好和平的国家和世界人民极其蛮横的挑衅。
    吴田指出，最近，美国当局又在大肆宣扬所谓“有条件停止轰炸”、战争“降级”、“有条件撤军”等“和平谈判”论调。但是，美国疯狂轰炸河内市，表明它在侵越战争中迈出了空前“升级”的一步。约翰逊集团的“和平谈判”论调，只不过是美国强盗为了掩盖它在侵越战争中新的“升级”步骤的一种欺骗手段，妄图用炸弹来动摇越南人民的抗美救国精神，迫使越南人民向它投降。
    吴田强调说，越南人民十分热爱和平，但是，这必须是真正获得独立、自由的和平。
    他说，越南人民决心实现胡志明主席的抗美救国神圣号召，不怕艰苦和牺牲，决心战胜美国侵略强盗，而且也一定能够战胜美国侵略强盗。
