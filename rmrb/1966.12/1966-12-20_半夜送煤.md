In the early days of November, the wind was strong and the weather was cold in the mountain valley. On this day, during the break between shifts, the company headquarters announced: Each shift should send two comrades to carry coal for heating back to their own shift. The third shift leader assigned the task to Qi Anfu and Li Yuanben. When they arrived at the coal yard with their baskets, the deputy company commander said, "Each shift gets twelve baskets, each basket one hundred and five jin. Look at this basket I've packed; use it as the standard, and we won't weigh each basket individually." Qi Anfu looked at the packed basket and saw that the large and small pieces of coal were well-mixed and slightly above the rim of the basket. As soon as the deputy company commander finished arranging the coal-carrying work, he was called away. Qi Anfu and Li Yuanben looked at the large pile of shiny black coal and felt an indescribable joy. Following the deputy company commander's instructions, they carried the first basket. When carrying the second basket, Qi Anfu saw the large pieces of coal on the other side and picked them, saying to Li Yuanben, "Let's add one more big piece!" His suggestion was agreed upon by Li Yuanben. When carrying the third basket, Qi Anfu said again, "Adding one more piece won't be a burden on the shoulders; let's add one more!" They saw the pile of coal they had carried back to their shift, which was large in quantity and big in size, and they felt delighted.

In the evening, the company held a roll call. The political instructor first read a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: "...When faced with a task, one first thinks of oneself and then of others.... Such a person is not a Communist, at least not a pure Communist." He continued, "Chairman Mao calls on us to learn from Comrade White's spirit of selflessness and dedication to others. We must consciously practice this in everything we do, combining learning with application, especially focusing on application... The political instructor's words struck Qi Anfu and Li Yuanben's hearts.

After the roll call, the class discussion began. Class leader Zhou Bolang led everyone to review "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again. He first examined himself and said to everyone, "We should be selfless and dedicated to others. Why haven't we done this in specific matters? Only with the public interest in mind can we always think of the whole; with personal interests in mind, it is not just harming the public for personal gain, but also harming the greater public for the lesser public..." Soldier Yan Guangrong said, "Take today's coal-carrying task as an example. I think our class carried a few more pieces of good coal, but forgot about the class solidarity with all the comrades in the company, which is not appropriate..." Thus, everyone discussed the coal-carrying matter more and more heatedly and deeply. Everyone agreed that to truly establish a worldview of selflessness, one must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out a thorough self-revolution in one's soul; in daily life, one must focus on the big picture and start with small details, bit by bit eliminating selfish thoughts, and strive persistently and unremittingly. Finally, everyone said, "If we have done something wrong, we must correct it. Tomorrow morning, we will return all the extra good coal we carried."

It had been a long time since the lights were turned off, but Qi Anfu had no sleep. He reflected on his mistake during the day with a very heavy heart. When he thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "If one makes a mistake, one should correct it. The sooner and more thoroughly one corrects it, the better," he could no longer lie down. He whispered to Li Yuanben, "Comrade Liu Yingjun does not let problems linger overnight. We made a mistake today, so we cannot wait until tomorrow morning to correct it!"

Qi Anfu and Li Yuanben quietly got out of bed, found a basket, and went out. Other comrades heard the sound of coal blocks outside and knew that they were returning the coal in the dark, so everyone helped them, and they returned the extra large pieces of coal they had carried during the day back to their original place.

It was deep into the night, and all the comrades in the class had peacefully fallen asleep. Qi Anfu and Li Yuanben also emitted steady snores.

    半夜送煤
    杨喜盛　廖林浩
    十一月上旬，山沟里风紧天寒。这一天工间休息时，连部通知：每班派两名同志往自己班里抬烤火煤。三班长把任务交给了齐安福和李元根。当他俩抬着筐来到煤场时，副连长说：“每班十二筐，每筐一百零五斤。大家看我装好的这一筐，就以它为标准，不再一筐一筐过秤了。”齐安福往装好的一筐看去，只见大小煤块搭配，稍稍高出筐的边沿。副连长刚把抬煤工作布置停当，就被人叫走了。齐安福和李元根看着这一大堆乌黑发亮的块煤，心里有说不出的高兴。按照副连长的布置，他俩抬了第一筐。在抬第二筐的时候，齐安福看着那边有大块大块的煤，就专拣大的挑，对李元根说：“再多加一块大的吧！”他的意见得到了李元根的同意。抬第三筐的时候，齐安福又说：“多加一块抬在肩上也没啥，再加一块吧！”他俩看到自己给班里抬回的一堆煤，量多块大，心里美滋滋的。
    晚上，连里点名。指导员首先给大家读了一段毛主席语录：“……一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。……这种人其实不是共产党员，至少不能算一个纯粹的共产党员。”他接着说：“毛主席叫我们学习白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，我们要时时事事处处自觉去做，学用结合，特别要在用字上狠下功夫……。”指导员的话，一下下地敲在齐安福和李元根的心上。
    点名结束后，班里的讨论会开始了。班长周波良领着大家重新学习了一遍《纪念白求恩》。他首先检查了自己，并对大家说：“我们要毫不利己专门利人，为什么在一些具体事情上就没作到呢？只有公字当头，才能经常想到整体；私字当头不是损公利己，也是损大公利小公……。”战士燕广荣说：“就拿今天抬煤的事来说，我看咱班多抬了几块好煤，可忘记了跟全连同志的阶级感情，很不应该……。”于是大家围绕抬煤的事，越谈越热烈，越谈越深刻。大家一致认为，要真正树立起一心为公的世界观，必须以毛泽东思想为武器，在灵魂深处大闹自我革命；在日常生活中，大处着眼，小处着手，一点一滴地破除私心杂念，长期奋战，始终不懈。最后大家说：“做错了事，就要改正。明天一早，咱们就把多抬的好煤全部送回去。”
    熄灯已经很久了，齐安福一点也没有睡意。他怀着十分沉痛的心情反省自己白天所犯的错误。当他想起毛主席的教导：“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好”，他再也躺不住了。他小声对李元根说：“刘英俊同志有问题不过夜，我们今天错了，就不能等到明天早晨再改正！”
    齐安福和李元根偷偷地起了床，找了一个抬筐，就出去了。其他同志听到外面煤块在响，知道他俩在摸黑送煤，于是大家一齐帮他们，把白天多抬的大块煤连夜还回了原处。
    夜深了，全班同志都安然地进入梦乡，齐安福和李元根同志也发出均匀的鼾声。
