The warm praise from our homeland's kin has greatly inspired 41 overseas Chinese youth heroes. The young heroes say: Glory belongs to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, December 10th - The 41 overseas Chinese youth heroes, who have received warm praise from their kin in the homeland, have resolved to continue holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to serve the people for life, and to dedicate all their strength to the socialist revolution and construction of the motherland, as well as to the liberation cause of the people of the world. They say: The victories we achieved in our struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries are victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The glory first belongs to our great leader Chairman Mao and to the people of the motherland who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

After their deeds of struggle were published in the newspapers, the 41 overseas Chinese youth immediately conducted a collective study of the editorial "The Triumphant Song of Mao Zedong Thought from Overseas" published in the People's Daily on the 9th, and combined this with studying Chairman Mao's quotations. They seriously discussed the reasons for their victory in the struggle and how to view the honor bestowed upon them by their kin in the homeland.

Wang Jinming, who always cared for his comrades even in the most difficult times of struggle, said, "We were able to fearlessly confront the heavily armed Indonesian reactionaries and dare to struggle because Chairman Mao taught us to see through the Indonesian reactionaries as nothing but paper tigers. We were able to unite as one in the most difficult times of struggle because Chairman Mao taught us to hate our enemies to the core and to cherish and protect our comrades."

Guo Lihua, who remained steadfast in the face of the enemy's torture, said, "Our victory in the struggle is the result of the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese, inspired by Mao Zedong Thought, giving their full support. It is the result of the 700 million people of the motherland, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, giving their full support. Any victory we achieve must first be attributed to our great leader Chairman Mao, and to the patriotic overseas Chinese and the people of the motherland who support our struggle."

The heroic youths expressed in the discussion that they had only done what they should have in the struggle and must regard the praise from the Party and their kin in the homeland as a great encouragement and spur. Zheng Xiancai, a young woman who endured the enemy's gunstock blows to share the pain with her comrades, said, "We must make the greatest effort and work hard to master Mao Zedong Thought, establish the spirit of selflessness, follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, and serve the people for life."

Yu Yazhou, Cai Qianglin, Xie Jiefang, and others all expressed that in the future, they must continue to strengthen their tempering in the great storms of class struggle and study Chairman Mao's works more diligently. Yu Yazhou, who dared to confront the enemy's gun muzzles and denounce the fascist bandits, said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that it is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life and not do bad deeds. We must not disappoint Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, devote ourselves to the revolution, take root among the masses, and serve the people for life."

In the discussion, the 41 overseas Chinese youths also expressed their determination to continue holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to establish the ambition to struggle for the socialist revolution and construction of the motherland and for the world revolution for life. They said, "There are still the majority of oppressed peoples in the world who have not been liberated. We must have a global revolutionary spirit and be determined to struggle for the liberation of all mankind for life. We must go to the most arduous places in the motherland to welcome new battle tasks."

    祖国亲人的热情赞扬有力地鼓舞了四十一名华侨青少年
    小英雄们说：光荣归于伟大领袖毛主席
    新华社湛江十日电受到祖国亲人热情赞扬的英雄的四十一名华侨青少年，决心继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，为人民服务一辈子，为祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设以及全世界人民的解放事业贡献自己的一切力量。他们说：我们在同印尼反动派斗争中取得的胜利是毛泽东思想的胜利。光荣首先归于我们伟大的领袖毛主席，归于用毛泽东思想武装起来的祖国人民。
    四十一名华侨青少年的斗争事迹在报纸上发表以后，他们立即集体学习了《人民日报》九日的社论《海外传来毛泽东思想的凯歌》，并且结合学习毛主席语录，认真地讨论了他们为什么能够取得斗争胜利和如何对待祖国亲人给予他们的荣誉的问题。
    在斗争最艰难的时候都时刻关心战友们的王金铭说，我们能够在武装到牙齿的印尼反动派面前无所畏惧，敢于斗争，这是因为毛主席教育我们看穿了印尼反动派不过是只纸老虎。我们所以能够在斗争最困难的时候团结得像一个人一样，这是因为毛主席教育我们懂得了对敌人要切齿痛恨，对同志要互相爱护。
    在敌人的严刑拷打面前从不动摇的郭利华说，我们斗争的胜利，是在毛泽东思想鼓舞下的广大爱国华侨全力支持的结果，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的祖国七亿人民全力支持的结果。我们的任何胜利，都要首先归功于我们的伟大领袖毛主席，归功于支持我们斗争的爱国侨胞和祖国人民。
    英雄的青少年们在讨论中纷纷表示：我们只是在斗争中作了自己应该作的事情，一定要把党和祖国亲人对自己的赞扬看作是莫大的鼓励和鞭策。在斗争中用自己的身体去承受敌人枪托的重击来为战友分担苦痛的女青年郑仙彩说，我们一定要用最大的努力，下苦功夫把毛泽东思想学到手，树立一切为公的思想，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，为人民服务一辈子。
    余亚周、蔡强霖、谢接芳等都表示，今后一定要在阶级斗争的大风大浪中继续加强锻炼，更加刻苦地学习毛主席著作。敢于面对敌人的枪口痛斥法西斯匪徒的余亚周说，毛主席教导我们，一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，我们一定不辜负毛主席和祖国人民的期望，牢记着毛主席的教导，一心为革命，在群众中落地生根，一辈子为人民服务。
    在讨论中，四十一位华侨青少年还表示要继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，树立为祖国社会主义革命和建设以及为世界革命奋斗终身的雄心壮志。他们说，世界上还有大多数被压迫人民没有解放，我们一定要胸怀世界革命，抱定为解放全人类而奋斗一生的决心，到祖国最艰苦的地方去迎接新的战斗任务。
