Art workers, with Chairman Mao's thoughts on the peasant movement and armed struggle as their guide, extensively absorbed the opinions of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards, and carried out important modifications and recreations. They vividly portrayed the peasants' struggle of resistance, elevating the ideological level of the entire work to a new height.

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: According to the demands and suggestions of the revolutionary masses, the entire clay sculpture group of "The Rent Collection Courtyard" from the Class Education Exhibition Hall in Daxian, Sichuan, has been reproduced and is now officially on display at the Palace Museum in the capital. The newly reproduced clay sculptures of "The Rent Collection Courtyard" have undergone important modifications and recreations, more vividly and prominently embodying the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, with both ideological and artistic levels elevated to new heights. This is a new achievement of art workers in the process of reproduction by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and a new achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"The Rent Collection Courtyard," born in the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is a brilliant victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and a great innovation in the art of sculpture. Through more than a hundred life-sized sculptures, it vividly and realistically reflects the shocking class struggle in rural China under the old society, fiercely denouncing the heinous crimes of the landlord class in exploiting and oppressing the peasants, and praising the spirit of peasant resistance. By the end of last year, art workers from Sichuan and Beijing had reproduced some of the sculptures of "The Rent Collection Courtyard," along with all the photographs of the original work, which were successively exhibited at the National Art Museum of China and the Gate Tower of Shengwu Gate in the Forbidden City, receiving enthusiastic praise from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as international friends. Poor and lower-middle peasants said: "The Rent Collection Courtyard" speaks out the bitterness and hatred of the old society for us! Revolutionary masses said: "The Rent Collection Courtyard" is the best classroom for class education! People, with strong revolutionary passion, watched "The Rent Collection Courtyard," their hearts burning with hatred for the old society and all systems of exploitation, igniting their boundless love for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, and further strengthening their resolve to carry the socialist revolution and world revolution to the end. In the past eleven months, the audience has been very enthusiastic, exceeding two million visits. The revolutionary masses have repeatedly requested that the sculptures of "The Rent Collection Courtyard" be entirely reproduced and permanently exhibited in the capital to educate future generations, to never forget class struggle, to always follow Chairman Mao in revolution, and to defend the iron fortress of the proletariat with their lives!

The exhibition hall of the newly reproduced "The Rent Collection Courtyard" sculptures is set in the Hall of Martial Valor within the Palace Museum. The exhibition hall is named "Class Education Hall - The Rent Collection Courtyard." The full-body sculpture of our great leader Chairman Mao stands tall in the front hall of the exhibition hall. The walls of the exhibition hall are adorned with golden calligraphy of Chairman Mao's quotes on class struggle. The entire clay sculpture of "The Rent Collection Courtyard" is arranged on a corridor composed of many cylindrical pillars, divided into six parts according to the sequence of events: paying rent, inspecting rent, measuring grain, settling accounts, demanding rent, and resisting. The original 114 sculptures have been modified and reproduced into 119 sculptures, with 16 new creations. The background and settings on the corridor are all made to resemble the scene of "The Rent Collection Courtyard" in Daxian, Sichuan. The dim brick walls, the grain storage with a wide mouth, the big door through which the thugs drag the pregnant woman into the inner courtyard, the gloomy prison, and so on, vividly set off the darkness of this hell on earth, arousing the revolutionary masses' strong hatred for the old society and the evil landlord class.

The most significant changes made during the reproduction process were in the final part of the work, "Resistance," which depicts the peasants awakening and taking the path of revolutionary struggle.

The art workers, based on the opinions of the revolutionary masses, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, daring to innovate, daring to act, and daring to revolutionize. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's discussions on the peasant movement and armed struggle. Chairman Mao said: "In feudal society in China, only the class struggle, uprisings, and wars of the peasantry were the genuine motive force of historical development." Chairman Mao also said: "The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and the laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the force of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be transformed with the gun." The art workers, guided by these brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao, carried out modifications and designs, making the peasants' struggle of resistance in "The Rent Collection Courtyard" develop from spontaneous to conscious, from general resistance to armed struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party, thus elevating the ideological level of the entire work to a new height.

In line with these changes, the spirit of peasant resistance throughout the work has been strengthened. Some peasants' images, although only modified in one action, make the characters' fighting spirit more soaring, the images more towering, and righteousness overcoming evil.

The improvement of "The Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculptures in the reproduction process is also the result of art workers holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the mass line, open creation, and humbly learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers. Throughout the reproduction process, they repeatedly invited workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards to the site for visits, discussing and researching issues in the reproduction and modification process together. During the reproduction period, tens of thousands of workers, peasants, labor models, PLA soldiers, and Red Guards visited by invitation, proposing thousands of suggestions. Almost every important modification suggestion came from workers, peasants, and Red Guards. In the "Settling Accounts" part, an old man knocked down by the landlord Liu Wen Cai was originally sculpted with his head down, and although his left hand pointed at Liu Wen Cai, the spirit of resistance was not prominent. Some PLA comrades suggested after watching: "Why doesn't the old man raise his head to glare at Liu Wen Cai?" The art workers felt this suggestion was good, and after modification, it was sculpted into the old man raising his head to glare at the class enemy, with a completely different effect from the original. Similarly, the modification suggestions for the "Resistance" part also came from workers, peasants, and soldiers. If the masses were not satisfied with one change, the art workers would study Chairman Mao's works again and make another change. When determining the final modification plan for this part, many PLA soldiers, Red Guards, and old workers came to the reproduction site and discussed with the art workers until late at night. The art workers, through extensive contact with workers and peasants, received profound class education. They deeply felt that the working class and peasant masses understood Chairman Mao's thoughts most profoundly, had the firmest class stance, and the most vivid class feelings. They were the best teachers for art workers. Many creators, in combination with their own thoughts, found the gap with workers and peasants, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and decided to better learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers and thoroughly transform their worldview.

Many workers, peasants, and Red Guards who visited the pre-exhibition expressed enthusiastic praise for the newly reproduced works. They said: "This change is good, better reflecting the truth that where there is exploitation and oppression, there is resistance." Some said: "The reactionaries are paper tigers, and we laboring people are hard-boned. We should make our people stand tall." A national labor model said: "In the past, why did we laboring people always suffer from the bullying of reactionaries? It was because the gun was in their hands. Chairman Mao led us to seize the gun and the printing press, and we have finally stood tall. We must forever defend the proletarian state, making our country never change color." A Red Guard wrote in the suggestion book: "The new reproduction breaks through the old framework, continuing to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on the basis of the original work, which has greater educational significance for domestic and foreign audiences."

In addition to the three original authors from Sichuan, the participants in this reproduction work also included art workers from Beijing and Tianjin, red guards and revolutionary students from art academies, red guards and revolutionary students from Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts and Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts who came to Beijing for revolutionary linkage, as well as old workers from the Palace Museum. With the surging revolutionary enthusiasm released in the Cultural Revolution, they eagerly threw themselves into the battle, completing the reproduction task in just over a month.

The awakened peasants, armed with pitchforks, hoes, and other weapons, bravely carried out organized resistance under leadership, knocking down the landlord's thugs and seizing their guns to arm themselves.

    毛主席光辉文艺思想新体现　无产阶级文化大革命新成果
    《收租院》全部泥塑重新复制在京展出
    美术工作者以毛主席关于农民运动和武装斗争的思想为指针，广泛吸取了工农兵和红卫兵的意见，进行了重要的加工修改和再创造，突出地体现了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把《收租院》中农民的反抗斗争更强烈地表现出来，使整个作品的思想性提高到一个新的高度。
    新华社二日讯　根据广大革命群众的要求和建议，重新复制的四川大邑阶级教育展览馆《收租院》全部泥塑群像，现已在首都故宫博物院正式展出。新复制的《收租院》泥塑群像，经过重要的加工修改和再创造，更加鲜明突出地体现了伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，思想性和艺术性有了新的提高。这是美术工作者们在复制过程中活学活用毛主席著作所取得的新成就，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一新成果。
    在无产阶级文化大革命初期诞生的泥塑《收租院》，是毛泽东文艺思想的光辉胜利，是雕塑艺术革命的伟大创举。它通过一百多个和真人大小相似的塑像，深刻而真实地反映了旧中国农村惊心动魄的阶级斗争图景，愤怒地控诉了地主阶级残酷剥削压迫农民的滔天罪恶，歌颂了农民的反抗精神。去年年底，四川和北京等地的文艺工作者复制了《收租院》的部分塑像，连同原作的全部照片一起，先后在首都中国美术馆和故宫神武门城楼上展出，受到广大工农兵和国际友人的热烈欢迎和赞扬。贫下中农们说：《收租院》替我们控诉出了旧社会的苦和恨！广大革命群众说：《收租院》是最好的阶级教育的课堂！人们怀着强烈的革命激情看过《收租院》，胸中燃起仇恨旧社会和一切剥削制度的万丈怒火，激发起对毛主席对中国共产党的无比热爱，更加坚定了将我国社会主义革命和世界革命进行到底的决心。十一个月来，观众非常踊跃，已经超过了两百万人次。广大革命群众纷纷要求将《收租院》塑像全部复制出来，在首都永久展出，以教育子孙万代，永远不忘阶级斗争，永远跟着毛主席干革命，誓死捍卫无产阶级的铁打江山！
    新复制的《收租院》塑像展览室设在故宫博物院的奉先殿内。展览室定名为“阶级教育馆——收租院”。我们伟大领袖毛主席的全身塑像，屹立在展览大厅的前厅。展览厅的墙壁上，悬挂着用金字缀成的毛主席关于阶级斗争的语录。《收租院》全部泥塑像陈列在由许多根圆柱组成的围廊上，按情节发展顺序，分成交租、验租、过斗、算账、逼租、反抗六个部分。原作一百一十四个塑像，现在修改复制成为一百一十九个塑像，其中有十六个塑像是新创作的。围廊上的背景和陈设，都是仿照四川大邑《收租院》现场制作的。灰暗的砖墙、张着大口的粮仓、狗腿子强拉产妇进内院的那张大门、阴森的监牢，等等，逼真地衬托出这座人间地狱的黑暗，激起革命群众对旧社会对万恶的地主阶级的强烈仇恨。
    在复制过程中，改动较大的是整个作品结尾的《反抗》部分。这部分塑像表现农民们觉醒起来走上革命斗争的道路。
    参加复制的美术工作者们根据广大革命群众的意见，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，发扬敢闯、敢干、敢革命的精神，大胆进行再创造。他们反复学习了毛主席关于农民运动和武装斗争的论述。毛主席说：“在中国封建社会里，只有这种农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”毛主席还说：“帝国主义时代的阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”美术工作者们以毛主席这些光辉的思想为指针，进行修改设计，使《收租院》中农民的反抗斗争由自发发展到了自觉的阶段，由一般的反抗发展到共产党领导下的武装斗争，从而使整个作品的思想性提高到一个新的高度。
    和这些改动相适应，整个作品中农民的反抗精神都加强了。有些农民的形象虽然只是修改了一个动作，却使人物的斗志更加昂扬，形象更加高大，正气压倒了邪气。
    《收租院》泥塑群像在复制中获得提高，也是美术工作者高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持群众路线，开门创作，虚心向工农兵学习的结果。在整个复制过程中，他们不断邀请工农兵和红卫兵小将到现场参观，和他们一起讨论、研究复制修改中的问题。在复制期间，陆续应邀前往参观的工农群众、劳动模范、解放军和红卫兵等达数万人，提出了几千条意见。几乎每一处重要的修改建议，都是由工农兵和红卫兵小将提出来的。《算账》部分中被地主刘文彩打倒在地的一位老大爷，原来塑像是低着头，左手虽然指着刘文彩，但反抗精神不够突出。一些解放军同志看了以后提出：“老大爷的头为什么不抬起来怒视刘文彩呢？”美术工作者们感到这个意见提得好，经过修改，就塑造成老大爷昂首怒视阶级敌人的形象，效果和原作迥然不同。又如《反抗》部分的修改建议也是工农兵提出的。改了一次群众不满意，美术工作者们就再学习毛主席著作，再改。在确定这一部分的最后一次修改方案时，许多解放军指战员、红卫兵、老工人到复制现场和美术工作者一起讨论直到深夜。美术工作者们在和工农兵广泛接触中，受到极深刻的阶级教育。他们深切体会到，工农兵群众对毛主席思想领会最深刻，阶级立场最坚定，阶级感情最鲜明，他们是文艺工作者最好的老师。许多创作人员结合自己的思想，同工农兵找差距，反复学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，决心更好地向工农兵学习，彻底改造自己的世界观。
    参观预展的许多工农兵和红卫兵对新复制的作品表示热烈赞扬。他们说：这样改，改得好，更好地体现了哪里有剥削压迫，哪里就有反抗的真理。有的说：“反动派是纸老虎，我们劳动人民是硬骨头，就是应该把我们的人做得硬挺些。”一位全国劳动模范说：“过去咱们劳动人民为什么尽受反动派的欺侮，就是因为枪杆子掌握在他们手里。毛主席领导咱们把枪杆子和印把子夺过来，咱们才扬眉吐气了。我们一定要永保无产阶级江山，使我们的国家永不变色。”一位红卫兵在意见簿中，称赞新复制的作品“突破了旧框框”，“是在原作基础上继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的新胜利，对国内外观众都有更大的教育意义。”
    参加这项复制工作的除三位四川的原作者外，还有北京、天津的美术工作者和艺术院校的红卫兵和革命师生，还有广州美术学院和浙江美术学院来京进行革命串连的红卫兵和革命学生，以及故宫博物院的老工人。他们带着在文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天革命干劲，紧张地投入了战斗，仅仅用了一个多月时间，就胜利地完成了复制任务。（附图片）
    觉悟了的农民们，拿起梭镖、扁担等武器，英勇地进行有领导有组织的反抗斗争，他们把地主狗腿子打翻在地，夺过枪来武装自己。
