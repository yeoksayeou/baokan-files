I want to study Chairman Mao's works word for word. I am currently studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." After I finish reading it, I will give it to my friends so they can also learn about the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao led the Chinese people in their revolution, drove out imperialism, overthrew Chiang Kai-shek, and the broad masses of laboring people gained freedom and happiness. The liberated Chinese people love their leader Mao Zedong. The African people also love Mao Zedong because the Chinese revolution and construction led by him have educated the African people and shown us the path to our own liberation.

    我要一字一句地学毛主席著作
    我正在学习《毛泽东选集》，我要一字一句地学。等我看完后，我就送给我的朋友，让他们也了解一下中国革命。毛泽东领导中国人民闹革命，赶走了帝国主义，打倒了蒋介石，广大劳动人民得到了自由和幸福。解放了的中国人民热爱自己的领袖毛泽东，非洲人民也同样热爱毛泽东，因为他领导的中国革命和建设教育了非洲人民，给我们指出了自己解放的道路。
