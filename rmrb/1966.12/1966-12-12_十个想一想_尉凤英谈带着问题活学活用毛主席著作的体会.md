	Ten Things to Think About
	Wei Fengying on Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works with Questions in Mind

	Editor's Note: Comrade Lin Biao has called on us to study and apply Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind. Wei Fengying's "Ten Things to Think About" is an excellent example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind.

	Wei Fengying is good at grasping her own active thoughts. The "Ten Things to Think About" summarize the main problems she often encounters in class struggle, work, and life. By addressing these problems, one can essentially grasp the laws of thought and proactively wage the battle of ideas.

	Wei Fengying is adept at using the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to hit the "target" of her own ideological problems. When she encounters problems, she finds the fundamental viewpoints in Chairman Mao's works to solve these problems, carefully compares and examines them, repeatedly studies and applies them, and achieves immediate results.

	From the "Ten Things to Think About," every comrade can gain great education and enlightenment. We should, like Wei Fengying, hold the deepest class feelings for Mao Zedong Thought, regard Mao Zedong Thought as the criterion for all our words and deeds, and constantly consult Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, so that we can grow rapidly into new people of communism under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Comrade Wei Fengying, a model worker of Chairman Mao, is an engineer at the Northeast Machinery Manufacturing Plant. On October 19 of this year, she gave a report on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to the revolutionary masses in the capital. On October 22, this newspaper published her report. Wei Fengying's deeds and experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works have been warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses. In this report, she talked about the "Ten Things to Think About" in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The broad revolutionary masses are eager to know the specific contents of the "Ten Things to Think About." Our reporter interviewed Wei Fengying on this issue. The following is the interview record.

	1. When facing major issues, think: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends?"

	For many years, Wei Fengying has acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In the face of major issues, she has always been firm in her stance and clear in her distinction between enemies and friends.

	In the old society, those landlords and capitalists would grind their teeth at three in the morning and eat people at five. Wei Fengying started begging for food with her mother at the age of three, suffering immense class hardships and harboring deep class hatred. She studied Chairman Mao's works and, when faced with major issues, would think about Chairman Mao's words, "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends?"

	Wei Fengying said: "I think that today, although the class enemies have been overthrown, they are still alive but not dead in spirit. They still have representatives. They are trying to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. There are thousands and millions of people in the world, but in terms of class, they are divided into two sides. No matter how clever you are in other aspects, if you cannot distinguish between enemies and friends, you are a confused person."

	During the Cultural Revolution, Wei Fengying thought and analyzed repeatedly. She saw that under the banner of revolution, there were genuine revolutionaries, as well as fake revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries. She remembered Chairman Mao's words: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful." She actively participated in denunciation meetings, wrote articles, and criticized counter-revolutionary revisionists. She said: "Our workers, peasants, and soldiers are flesh and blood with the Party and Chairman Mao. We are firmly with the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We are determined. Mother and I still have the broken copper bowl we used to beg for food in front of us. If you want me to return to the old society, that's just a daytime dream."

	2. When personal interests conflict with collective interests, think: "Serve the people wholeheartedly."

	Vice Chairman Lin Biao has called on us to study the "Three Articles" as a motto. Under the radiance of the "Three Articles," Wei Fengying has achieved wholehearted dedication to revolution and the people.

	In previous years, some people called Wei Fengying a foolish girl, saying she lacked a brain. In fact, Wei Fengying only lacked the brain of individualism. Whatever is hard, she does it. Wherever there is difficulty, she goes. She takes the initiative to do what others have not done. She runs ahead of what others want to do.

	During the factory's promotion exam, her fellow young workers who entered the factory with her were all preparing eagerly. Wei Fengying was then researching a key technical innovation, and although others repeatedly advised her to put the innovation aside for a while, she resolutely gave up the promotion exam and finally solved the key production problem. She thought: Lacking the brain of individualism is a good thing. Although she did not get promoted, she followed Chairman Mao's words and did something beneficial to the people, and her heart was very happy. People said, "Wei Fengying has only one brain." This one brain is the brain taught by Chairman Mao, "Serve the people wholeheartedly," "Selflessly serve the people."

	Wei Fengying said well: "One should not be like a cigarette butt, only lighting up one's own nose tip. One should do more work for the Party, do more good deeds for the people."

	3. When discipline is lax, think: "Oppose Liberalism."

	Liberalism is very harmful to revolutionary collective organizations. Wei Fengying studies Chairman Mao's works, does not commit liberalism herself, and strives to help others overcome liberalism.

	Overcoming difficulties and achieving victory is a good thing. However, it also brings some trouble. After achieving results, everyone talks and laughs, dances and jumps, and sometimes becomes lax, forgetting discipline. Wei Fengying thought of Chairman Mao's words: "Liberalism is extremely harmful in a revolutionary collective organization." She led everyone to sit down and study "Oppose Liberalism." However, when faced with difficulties, people become listless and undisciplined. What should be done? Wei Fengying organized everyone to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End."

	Liberalism is just the surface; there are still things inside. Wei Fengying thought of this. Therefore, she did not simply oppose liberalism but carefully found the root cause and went deep into the masses to do ideological work.

	4. When receiving criticism, think: "If there is, correct it; if there isn't, strive harder."

	How to treat criticism? Wei Fengying has also had deviations in her thoughts. However, she seriously studied Chairman Mao's works, thought about it many times, and knew that criticism is a good thing. For any criticism that is correct, she would correct it resolutely.

	Wei Fengying usually does not like to dress up, and someone advised her to tidy up and look like a girl. She changed into a new outfit and combed her hair neatly. Tang Shizhen saw this and said to her: "Having oil and dirt on your body is not scary, but having an unclean mind is scary. Today you wear a new outfit, and tomorrow you might want to wear something better. When working, you will be afraid of this and that. If this develops, it will be very dangerous." Wei Fengying thought, "Yes!" She immediately corrected it resolutely.

	When encountering criticism that is wrong, Wei Fengying always adopts the attitude of "If there isn't, strive harder" and sets higher standards for herself.

	Wei Fengying checks herself in the mirror every day, examining herself. For criticisms that are correct, she accepts them and corrects them resolutely. For flaws that others have not found, she proactively points them out and does not let flaws stay overnight. She said: "Even a fleeting private thought is not a completely thorough revolutionary." She always remembers Chairman Mao's words: "Because we are servants of the people, we should not be afraid of others pointing out our shortcomings."

	5. When achieving results, think: "Being humble makes one progress, being arrogant makes one fall behind."

	Achievements and honors, like setbacks and failures, are also tests for people. Chairman Mao said: "We must not become complacent and self-satisfied at the sight of success." Wei Fengying listens to Chairman Mao's words and is very humble in the face of honor, so she can continue to make progress.

	She humbly learns from others, not only from old workers but also from young workers. She saw that the apprentice Yuan Guimin disassembled and repaired the bed faster than herself, so she humbly learned from him.

	Wei Fengying never boasts about herself. She knows that arrogance leads to backwardness.

	Wei Fengying has seen our most beloved leader Chairman Mao thirteen times. Someone asked her for a photo of Chairman Mao shaking hands with her, but Wei Fengying said: "I cannot boast about myself. Chairman Mao's reception is the Party and the leader's care for all the people of the province, not my personal honor."

	Wei Fengying went to other factories to help with innovations and did many good deeds, but she never mentioned them. Someone said: "Even a bird flying leaves a trace, but you do good deeds and leave no name?" Wei Fengying said: "Farmers in the fields grow thousands of bushels of grain, enduring wind and rain, but not a single grain has their name on it! Miners dig thousands of tons of coal in the coal seams, enduring hardships, but not a single piece of coal has their name on it!"

	Wei Fengying always remembers Chairman Mao's teachings, "Being humble makes one progress, being arrogant makes one fall behind."

	6. When encountering difficulties, think: "Overcome all difficulties to strive for victory."

	Difficulties exist objectively, and doing revolution inevitably encounters difficulties. Wei Fengying said well: "Doing revolution, innovating, cannot avoid encountering difficulties. The main question is how we treat difficulties, whether we retreat in the face of difficulties or advance towards them."

	Wei Fengying wanted to create an automatic feeding device, but when the model was halfway done, she was stuck by the problem of the bending mechanism. What should she do?

	She pondered all day, not wanting to eat or sleep. She went to the train station to observe how the train wheels bend. She walked through the grass and saw grasshoppers jumping high. She caught one and carefully observed how its legs bend.

	One day, Wei Fengying returned home and saw her mother cleaning pig's feet. Suddenly, she thought that pig legs can also bend, so she quickly asked her mother why? Her mother said: "It has tendons and bones at the wrist!" This sentence reminded Wei Fengying. She thought: "Right! Tendons are springs, and bones at the wrist are the axis." Thinking of this, she did not even eat dinner and rushed back to the workshop to conduct experiments.

	The bending problem was finally solved. However, when everyone installed this device on the machine and tested it, they heard a crack, and it was crushed. The onlookers started talking: "It can't walk, but it wants to run." Wei Fengying was very sad. However, Chairman Mao's thoughts inspired her. Keep going! Difficulties must be taken seriously and defeated one by one.

	After five months of experimentation and eleven failures, it finally succeeded.

	Wei Fengying deeply felt: "In the face of difficulties, if you only think, 'It's over, it's over,' you will immediately collapse. If you think of Chairman Mao's teachings, 'Overcome all difficulties to strive for victory,' you will have endless energy."

	7. When there is no solution at work, think: "Three cobblers with their wits combined make a Zhuge Liang."

	When there is no solution at work, Wei Fengying thinks of Chairman Mao's teachings, "The people have limitless creativity," and seeks advice from the masses for every matter.

	Wei Fengying saw that the workshop had heavy tasks and could not complete the plan. She thought, can this punch press be made to work at both ends? She humbly sought advice from many people, and the trial production was successful. One punch press took on the tasks of seven. Someone said: "Wei Fengying is clever." Wei Fengying said: "This is the result of Chairman Mao's teachings and everyone's help!"

	Many people, great strength. Wei Fengying not only humbly learns from the masses but also further organizes the masses.

	Wei Fengying said: "A single thread does not make a cloth, a single tree does not make a forest. One person innovating and producing a hundred more products is still only a hundred. A hundred people, each producing ten more, is a thousand." Therefore, she organized the "Zhuge Liang" among the workers into the Red Expert Squad. They armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, used politics to lead technology, and attacked the key issues in production. They used their spare time, relying on the collective wisdom, and successfully completed 771 innovation projects.

	Wei Fengying thought, one person is not as good as two, three people can come up with a great idea. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, constantly seeking advice from the masses will lead to constant discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress.

	8. When encountering setbacks and failures, think: "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End."

	In technical innovation, Wei Fengying encountered countless setbacks and failures, but she was like the Foolish Old Man, and no difficulties could stop her.

	One spring, Wei Fengying and her team made a set of semi-automatic disc feeding tools to replace the backward manual feeding operation. However, when they tested it, the holes did not align with the center. The automated tool became a pile of junk and was sent to the warehouse. Someone made some sarcastic remarks.

	Wei Fengying thought, "Failure teaches success." Each failure brings one step closer to success. Success always follows failure. If you give up after one failure, you will never succeed. She shared this idea with everyone. Thus, the "junk" was taken out of the warehouse and continued to be tested.

	However, things were not that smooth. The test failed again, and the "junk" was sent back to the warehouse. Wei Fengying remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory." She led everyone to continue, but the test failed again, and the "junk" was sent to the warehouse for the third time. Faced with this situation, what should be done? Wei Fengying thought, Chairman Mao teaches us to "Make up our minds, not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." We have only tried a few times, how can we give up? She led everyone to continue the experiment, preparing for it to fail ten times, a hundred times, and never stop.

	The "junk" was taken out of the warehouse again for testing. Through collective wisdom and hard work, the experiment finally succeeded, and the daily output also increased.

	In the production struggle, Wei Fengying established this belief: Do not fear the long road, but fear the short will.

	9. When seeing others in difficulty, think: "Selflessly serve the people."

	Wei Fengying combined her specific actions with the lofty goal of serving the people, using silent language to propagate the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought.

	In Wei Fengying's view, helping others is a responsibility, not a burden; it is joy, not trouble; the closest are class ties, and class brothers' hearts are connected.

	Female worker Han Guirong suffered from a serious illness. At that time, only Han Guirong was in the dormitory, and Wei Fengying moved from her home to Han Guirong's dormitory to bring her water and food. Wei Fengying often read Chairman Mao's works to her, encouraging her to continue forward. Wei Fengying was going to Beijing for a meeting, and before leaving, she brought Han Guirong to her home to recuperate. In Beijing, she always thought of this sick class sister and wrote a letter to her mother, asking her to take good care of Han Guirong. With Wei Fengying's help, Han Guirong returned to the production line.

	Wei Fengying often remembered Chairman Mao's words: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly working for the people's interests." When others encounter difficulties, she is more anxious than others. She goes wherever she goes, doing good deeds. She is like a fire, and whoever gets close to her gets warm.

	10. When helping backward comrades, think: "Analyze things in two ways."

	In general, it is easy to find strengths in advanced individuals, but it is more difficult to find strengths in backward comrades. Wei Fengying, according to Chairman Mao's thought of "analyzing things in two ways," solved this problem.

	There was a technician whose thoughts had fallen behind, and although he was only in his thirties, he had grown a long beard and always worked with his head down. Comrades thought he was strange, difficult to approach, and did not want to approach him. Wei Fengying remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Communist Party members' attitude towards backward people is not to look down on them, despise them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to advance." She analyzed according to the thought of "analyzing things in two ways," although that technician had serious individualism, he had been an apprentice since he was young, suffered exploitation, and still had a certain class consciousness. He was good at research and had good skills. He should be helped to overcome his shortcomings and develop his strengths.

	Wei Fengying patiently helped him, tried a few times, and failed, but she did not give up. Wei Fengying thought, the best way is still to help him read Chairman Mao's books. She bought a copy of "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and gave it to the technician. The technician read "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and his heart was moved. He thought, "How could I forget my roots?"

	Wei Fengying saw this and thought, "His thoughts are beginning to change, seize the opportunity to promote it." She took out a razor blade she had been carrying for more than two months and said to him: "This razor blade is for you..." Before she finished speaking, the technician took it with both hands, tears in his eyes, and said excitedly: "This is the razor blade for a thorough revolution! I will use this razor blade to shave off the lumps in my thoughts!" This technician finally shaved off the "lump beard" and underwent a thorough transformation, later becoming an advanced worker.

	Wei Fengying thus enthusiastically helped backward comrades, mobilized their positive factors, and brought them into the ranks of the advanced.

    十个想一想
    尉凤英谈带着问题活学活用毛主席著作的体会
    编者按：林彪同志号召我们，要带着问题活学活用毛主席著作。尉凤英的“十个想一想”，就是带着问题活学活用毛主席著作的一个范例。
    尉凤英善于抓自己的活思想。“十个想一想”，概括了她在阶级斗争中，在工作和生活中，经常遇到的主要问题。抓住了这些问题，也就基本上抓住了思想规律，就能主动地打好思想仗。
    尉凤英善于用毛泽东思想之“矢”射自己思想问题之“的”。她遇到问题，就从毛主席著作中找出解决这个问题的基本观点，认真对照，认真检查，反复学习，反复运用，收到了立竿见影的效果。
    从“十个想一想”里，我们每个同志都可以得到很大教育和启发。我们要像尉凤英那样，对毛泽东思想怀着最深厚的阶级感情，以毛泽东思想为一切言论和行动的准则，时时处处带着问题向毛主席著作请教，使自己在毛泽东思想的哺育下，迅速成长为共产主义新人。
    毛主席的好工人尉凤英，是东北机器制造厂的工人工程师。她在今年十月十九日，向首都革命群众作了一个活学活用毛主席著作的报告。十月二十二日本报发表了她的报告。尉凤英活学活用毛主席著作的事迹和经验，深受广大革命群众欢迎。在这个报告中，她谈到了活学活用毛主席著作的“十个想一想”。广大革命群众很希望知道“十个想一想”的具体内容。本报记者就这个问题，访问了尉凤英。下面就是访问纪要。
    一、在大是大非面前，要想一想：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？”
    多少年来，尉凤英按照毛主席的指示办事，在大是大非面前，一直立场坚定，敌我界限分明。
    在旧社会，那些地主资本家，三更天磨牙，五更天吃人。尉凤英三岁就跟妈妈去讨饭，吃尽了阶级苦，满怀着阶级恨。她学了毛主席著作，碰到大是大非，就好好想一想毛主席的话，“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？”
    尉凤英说：“我想，今天，那些阶级敌人虽然被打倒了。可是，他们人还在，心不死。他们还有代表人物。他们企图推翻无产阶级专政，实现资本主义复辟。世上人千千万万，论阶级一分两边。说一千，道一万，你别的地方再聪明，要是分不清敌人和朋友，那就是个糊涂人。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，尉凤英想了又想，分析又分析，她看到在革命的红旗下面，有真正的革命派，也有假革命派，还有反革命。她想起毛主席的话：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”她积极参加声讨会，写文章，批判反革命修正主义分子。她说：“我们工农兵的骨肉，跟党跟毛主席连在一起。跟党中央跟毛主席我们是跟定了，是铁了心了。妈妈同我要饭的破铜碗还摆在跟前哩，要我回到旧社会，那是白天做梦。”
    二、个人利益和集体利益发生矛盾的时候，要想一想：“全心全意地为人民服务”。
    林彪副主席号召我们，要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学。尉凤英在“老三篇”的光辉照耀下，作到了一心为革命，一心为人民。
    前几年，有些人管尉凤英叫傻丫头，说她缺个心眼。其实，尉凤英不过缺个人主义的心眼罢了。什么累，她就干什么。哪里困难，她就到哪里去。别人未干的事，她抢着干。别人想干的事，她早就跑到前头。
    工厂举行晋级考试时，和她一起入厂的青年工人，都在积极准备。尉凤英当时正在研究一项技术革新的关键，尽管别人三番五次地劝她把革新放一放，可是她毅然放弃了晋级考试，终于解决了这个生产关键问题。她想：缺个人主义的心眼，可是件好事，虽然没有晋级，但听了毛主席的话，做了对人民有益的事，心里非常愉快。人们都说，“尉凤英只一个心眼。”这一个心眼，就是毛主席教导的“全心全意地为人民服务”的心眼，“毫不利己专门利人”的心眼。
    尉凤英说得好：“决不应该像烟头火一样，只照亮了自己鼻子尖前一点地方。应该为党多做一点工作，再多做一点工作；为人民多做一件好事，再多做一件好事。”
    三、纪律涣散的时候，要想一想：《反对自由主义》。
    自由主义对革命的集体组织是十分有害的。尉凤英学习毛主席著作，自己不犯自由主义，还努力帮助别人克服自由主义。
    闯过难关，取得胜利，是件好事。可是，它也带来点麻烦。有了成绩，大家又说又笑，又舞又蹈的，有时就松懈下来，把纪律忘掉了。尉凤英看到这里，就想到了毛主席说：“革命的集体组织中的自由主义是十分有害的。”她就带着大家，坐下来学习《反对自由主义》。可是，碰到困难又会使人委靡不振，精神涣散，纪律不严。怎么办呢？尉凤英就组织大家学习《愚公移山》、《将革命进行到底》。
    自由主义不过是外表，内心里还有东西。尉凤英想到这点。所以，她不是简简单单地反对自由主义，不像荷花叶子只浮在水皮上冒尖，而是细心去找根由，深入到群众中去，做好思想工作。
    四、受到批评的时候，要想一想：“有则改之，无则加勉”。
    怎样对待批评？尉凤英思想上也出过岔子。可是，她认真学习毛主席著作，想了好多遍，知道了批评是件好事。凡是批评对了的，她就坚决改正。
    尉凤英平常不爱打扮，有人劝她收拾得利索一些，像个姑娘样子。她就换上一身新，把头梳的亮光光的。汤世祯看到了，就对她说：“身上有油泥味，并不可怕，可怕的是思想不干净。今天你穿上件新衣服，明天就可能想穿更好的，干起活来怕这怕那的，这样发展下去就很危险。”尉凤英一想，对呀！她马上坚决改正。
    碰到批评错了的时候，尉凤英总是抱着“无则加勉”的态度，对自己提出更严格的要求。
    尉凤英天天照镜子，检查自己，别人批评对的，她就接受，坚决改正。别人没发现的缺点，就自己主动提出，决不让缺点过夜。她说：“有一闪而过的私心杂念也不是一个完全彻底的革命者。”她永远记住毛主席的话：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”
    五、有了成绩的时候，要想一想：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。
    成绩、荣誉同挫折、失败一样，对人也是一种考验。毛主席说：“我们决不能一见成绩就自满自足起来。”尉凤英听毛主席的话，在荣誉面前，她很虚心，所以就能不断进步。
    她虚心向别人学习，不仅向老工人学习，也向青年工人学习。她看到徒工袁桂敏拆修床子比自己快，就虚心去学习。
    尉凤英从不夸耀自己。她知道，骄傲起来，必然落后。
    尉凤英十三次见到我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席。有人向她要毛主席和她握手的照片，尉凤英却说：“我可不能夸耀自己。毛主席的接见，是党和领袖对全省人民的关怀，这不是我个人的荣誉。”
    尉凤英到外厂帮助人家闹革新，帮助别人做了许多好事，从来不说。有人说：“雁过还留声呢，你做了好事名都不留？”尉凤英说：“农民在田野里种千万石粮食，风吹雨淋，哪一粒粮食刻有自己的名啊？矿工们在煤层里挖千万吨煤炭，千辛万苦，哪一块煤上刻着他们自己的名啊？”
    尉凤英永远牢记着毛主席的教导，“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。
    六、遇到困难的时候，要想一想：“排除万难，去争取胜利”。
    困难是客观存在的，干革命就不可能不遇到困难。尉凤英说得好：“干革命，搞革新，不能不遇到困难。主要问题是看我们怎样对待困难，是在困难面前退却，还是迎着困难前进。”
    尉凤英想搞一个自动送料装置，但是，模型做到半道，就被打拐问题难住了，怎么办呢？
    她整天琢磨，连饭也不想吃，觉也不想睡了。她到火车站去，观察火车拐轴是怎么打拐的。她从草地走过，看到蚂蚱蹦得老高。她捉了一只，认真地观察它的腿是怎么打拐的。
    一天，尉凤英回家，看见妈妈在收拾猪蹄，猛然想到猪腿也能打拐，她连忙问妈妈为什么？妈说：“有筋有骨轴腕呗！”这一句话，提醒了尉凤英。她想：对！筋不就是弹簧，骨轴腕不就是轴吗？想到这里，她连饭也没顾得吃就跑回车间，去搞试验。
    打拐问题终于解决了。但是，当大家把这个装置安在机床上一试验，只听见咔嚓一声，被压扁了。看的人就七嘴八舌地议论：“不会走，就想跑了”。尉凤英心里难过极了。然而，毛主席的思想鼓舞了她。干下去！困难是要认真对待的，必须一个一个去打败它。
    经过了五个月的试验，十一次失败，终于成功了。
    尉凤英深有所感地说：“在困难面前，如果只是想，完了，完了，那就会马上垮下去。如果想到毛主席的教导，‘排除万难，去争取胜利’，使不完的劲儿也就来了。”
    七、工作没有办法的时候，要想一想：“三个臭皮匠，合成一个诸葛亮”。
    在工作没有办法时，尉凤英想起了毛主席教导的“人民群众有无限的创造力”，就遇事向群众请教。
    尉凤英看到车间任务重，完不成计划。她想，这个冲床一去就只能冲一个活，回来就空着，能不能搞个“两头忙”？她虚心向许多人请教，结果试制成功了。一台冲床包下了七台的任务。有人说：“尉凤英的脑子灵。”尉凤英说：“这是毛主席的教导和大家帮助的结果啊！”
    人多势众力量大，众人拾柴火焰高。尉凤英不仅自己虚心向群众学习，还进一步把群众组织起来。
    尉凤英说：“单线不成布，独木不成林。一个人搞革新，多生产一百个产品，也只是一百个。一百人，每人多生产十个就是一千个。”于是，她把工人中的“诸葛亮”组成了红专大队。他们用毛泽东思想武装头脑，用政治统帅技术，围攻生产中的关键。他们利用业余时间，依靠集体的智慧，先后搞成了七百七十一项革新项目。
    尉凤英想，一人不敌二人计，三人出个大主意。按照毛主席指示，不断向群众请教，就会不断有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。
    八、碰到挫折和失败的时候，要想一想：《愚公移山》《将革命进行到底》。
    在技术革新中，尉凤英碰到的挫折和失败，何止千百次？然而，她像愚公一样，什么困难的大山都挡她不住。
    一个春天，尉凤英和小组的同志，做出了一套圆盘式半自动上料工具，想代替手工上料的落后操作。可是一试验，孔不对中心。自动化工具变成一堆废物，送进仓库里去了。有人说了些风凉话。
    尉凤英想到，“吃一堑，长一智”。失败一次，就接近胜利一步。胜利总是跟在失败后边。碰到一次失败就算了，那就永远不会成功。她把这个想法对大家说了。于是“废物”从仓库里拿了出来，继续试验。
    然而，事情并不那么顺利，试验又没有成功，“废物”照旧被送进仓库。尉凤英想起了毛主席的教导：“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利”。她带领大家继续干，可是，试验又失败了，“废物”第三次进了仓库。面对这种情况怎么办？尉凤英想，毛主席教导我们，要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我们才试验这么几次，怎么就灰心了？她带领大家坚持试验下去。准备它失败十次、百次，决不停止。
    那个“废物”又从仓库里拿出来试验。经过群策群力，苦干巧干，试验终于成功了。日产量也提高了。
    在生产斗争中，尉凤英树立起这样一个信念：不怕天长，就怕志短。
    九、见到别人有困难的时候，要想一想：“毫不利己专门利人”。
    尉凤英把自己的具体行动同为人民服务这个崇高目标结合了起来，用无声的语言，宣传了金光闪闪的毛泽东思想。
    在尉凤英看来，帮助别人，是责任，不是负担；是快乐，不是麻烦；最亲是阶级亲，阶级兄弟心连心。
    女工韩桂英，患了严重的疾病。当时，宿舍里只有韩桂英一人，尉凤英从家里搬进韩桂英的宿舍，为她端水送饭。尉凤英经常给她念毛主席著作，鼓舞她继续前进。尉凤英要去北京开会，临走前，把韩桂英接到自己的家里养病。到北京后，她时刻惦记着这位病中的阶级姐妹，写信给自己妈妈，要她好好照顾韩桂英。在尉凤英的帮助下，韩桂英重新回到了生产岗位。
    尉凤英经常记住毛主席的话：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”别人有了困难，她比别人还着急。她走到哪里，好事做到哪里。她像一盆火，靠近谁，谁就暖。
    十、帮助后进同志的时候，要想一想：“一分为二”。
    在一般情况下，从先进人物身上找优点容易，从后进同志身上找优点，那就比较难了。尉凤英按照毛主席“一分为二”的思想，解决了这个问题。
    有位技术员，思想掉队了，年纪还不过三十，胡子倒蓄得很长，整天一个人闷着头干活。同志们觉得他怪，难接近，也不愿同他接近。尉凤英想起毛主席的教导：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”她按照一分为二的思想来分析，虽然那位技术员有严重的个人主义，可是，他从小当过徒工，受过剥削，还有一定的阶级觉悟。他肯钻研，技术好。应该帮助他克服缺点，发扬优点。
    尉凤英耐心帮助他，试了几次，都不“投簧”，碰了钉子回来。可是，她并不灰心。尉凤英想到，最好的办法，还是帮助他读毛主席的书。她就买了一本《为人民服务》，送给那个技术员。技术员学了《为人民服务》，心被打动了。他想到，“我怎么忘了本？”
    尉凤英看到眼里，心想，“他思想开始转变了，趁热打铁，要促进一下。”她把在怀里揣了两个多月的刀片拿了出来，对他说：“这刀片送给你……”她话没有说完，那位技术员含着热泪，双手接过来，激动地说：
  “这是让我彻底革命的刀片呵！我要用这刀片剃掉思想疙瘩！”这位技术员终于剃掉了“疙瘩胡”，彻底转变过来，后来成为先进工作者。
    尉凤英就是这样热情帮助后进的同志，调动他们的积极因素，使他们走到先进的行列里来。
