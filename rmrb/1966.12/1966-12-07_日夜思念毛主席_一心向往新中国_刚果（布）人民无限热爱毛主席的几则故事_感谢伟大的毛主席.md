One day, at the construction site of the Kinsondi United Textile Factory in Congo (Brazzaville), an elderly visitor arrived. He saw Chinese experts and technicians selflessly teaching Congolese workers technical skills and working with Congolese workers like brothers. This deeply moved him, and he repeatedly shouted, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!"

The old man's name was Danke, a railway worker. Originally, from 1921 to 1934, the colonialists had brought a large number of Chinese workers to build the railway from Brazzaville to Pointe-Noire with Congolese workers. Danke had also participated in this railway construction project. He remembered that the colonialists had used whips to force them to clear forests and mountains, hacking through thickets and opening up paths. Many Chinese workers and Congolese workers either died in work accidents, buried in caves, or died from overwork.

Today, Danke came to the site where Chinese experts and technicians were working with Congolese workers. Seeing the Chinese comrades who had traveled thousands of miles to help build Congo (Brazzaville) working selflessly and being so friendly and helpful to the Congolese workers, the old man couldn't help but recall the bitter past. He stood for a long time in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, repeatedly and affectionately saying, "Thank you, great Chairman Mao, thank you, great Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao Is with Us

In a small factory run by the People's Militia in the capital of Congo (Brazzaville), dozens of militia members were engaged in military training while also producing pottery and woodwork with a spirit of self-reliance. Among them, three young militia members, filled with boundless love for Chairman Mao, sculpted a life-sized bust of Chairman Mao. They were very careful while sculpting, sometimes comparing the sculpture with a photograph, sometimes discussing and pondering together. To sculpt Chairman Mao's image well, they worked from dawn to dusk for more than half a month.

The leader of the three sculptors was a 19-year-old named Yuyu. He had learned some drawing and sculpting as a child, and now he led the other two young men to create the great image of our Chairman Mao. When talking about their motivation for sculpting Chairman Mao's statue, he said: Many Congolese friends yearn for Beijing and hope to see Chairman Mao with their own eyes, but the opportunity is hard to come by. People encouraged him to create a great image of Chairman Mao so that everyone could often pay their respects. He also said, "The Congolese people love this greatest world revolutionary leader. I think about his image day and night, and sometimes I even dream of Chairman Mao."

One of his companions said, "While we were sculpting, we didn't think of anything else, only of Chairman Mao's greatness and his concern and support for the Congolese people."

The militia team leader in charge of the factory said, "Our militia members love Chairman Mao because his thoughts guide our actions. We read his books and are always with him."

Inspired by Mao Zedong Thought

Not long ago, a football team from Congo (Kinshasa) came to Brazzaville for a match. Their opponents happened to be the Congolese youth football team that had recently returned from a visit to China. The visiting Chinese youth delegation was invited to watch the match. During the game, every time the Congolese youth team scored a goal, the crowd sitting on both sides of the delegation stood up, cheering and shouting, "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Thank you, China!" "We sincerely thank Chairman Mao!" "Thank you, Mao Zedong Thought!" When the match ended, many people walked over to the delegation, shaking hands and embracing them.

The Congolese youth football team defeated the Congolese (Kinshasa) football team, which had previously won against another Congolese team, with a score of 3-1. A youth football team member spoke about the reason for their victory: "During our visit to China, we realized that the Chinese sports comrades are nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. We saw their collective heroism, their unity, mutual assistance, and high discipline and self-awareness, especially the revolutionary firmness inspired by Mao Zedong Thought. We learned from them, and we became more courageous, more determined, and more skilled. We know that we must play for our country, people, and revolution."

    日夜思念毛主席　一心向往新中国
    刚果（布）人民无限热爱毛主席的几则故事  感谢伟大的毛主席
    一天，在刚果（布）金松迪联合纺织厂的建筑工地上，来了一位年老的参观者。他看到中国专家、技术人员无私地教刚果（布）工人技术，同刚果工人们像亲兄弟般地在一起工作。这使他非常感动，他反复地喊：“毛主席，毛主席！”
    这位老人名叫丹卡，是一位铁路工人。原来，在一九二一年到一九三四年间，殖民者曾运来大批中国工人，同刚果（布）工人一起修筑从布拉柴维尔到黑角的铁路，丹卡当时也参加了这项筑路工程。他记得，殖民者用皮鞭强迫他们在森林里，高山上，披荆斩棘，开山辟岭。大批中国工人和刚果工人或因工伤事故，被埋在山洞里，或因劳累过度而死亡。
    今天，丹卡来到中国专家、技术人员同刚果（布）工人一起工作的场地上，看到中国同志们不远万里而来、为帮助刚果（布）建设而忘我地劳动，同刚果工人这般亲热、互相帮助和学习，老人不禁回忆起辛酸的往事，他长久伫立在场地上毛主席像前，反复而亲切地说：“感谢伟大的毛主席，感谢伟大的毛主席！”毛主席和我们在一起
    在刚果（布）首都民卫团开办的一个小工厂里，有几十位民卫团员一面进行军事训练，一面以自力更生精神从事制造陶器、木器等生产劳动。其中有三位年青的民卫团员，满怀对毛主席的无限热爱，雕塑了一个二尺多高的毛主席的半身塑像。他们在雕塑时十分细心，一会儿拿手中的照片对照塑像，一会儿互相议论，研究琢磨。他们为了雕塑好毛主席的像，每天从天亮忙到夜晚，工作了半个多月。
    三位雕塑工人中，为首的是十九岁的尤尤。他年幼时曾学过一些绘图雕塑，现在，他带领着另外两位青年，塑造起我们毛主席的伟大形象。他在谈起他们雕塑毛主席像的动机时说：许多刚果（布）朋友向往北京，热望亲眼见到毛主席，但机会很难得到，人们鼓励他塑造一座毛主席的伟大形象，以便让大家经常瞻仰。他又说：“刚果人民热爱这位最伟大的世界革命领袖，我日夜琢磨着他的形象，有时做梦也看到毛主席。”
    他的另一位同伴说：“我们在雕塑时，什么也不想，只想着毛主席的伟大，毛主席对刚果人的关心和支持。”
    负责这个工厂的民卫团队长说：“我们民卫团员热爱毛主席，因为他的思想指导着我们的行动。我们读他的书，同他永远在一起。”受到毛泽东思想鼓舞
    不久前，刚果（利）有一个足球队到布拉柴维尔来比赛。他们的对手恰巧是最近从中国访问归来的刚果（布）青年足球队。在这里访问的中国青年代表团应邀观看了这场比赛。在比赛中，刚果（布）青年队队员每踢进一球，坐在代表团两旁的群众就站起来，朝着中国代表团热烈鼓掌，高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”“感谢中国！”“我们真诚感谢毛主席！”“感谢毛泽东思想！”比赛结束时，许多人走向代表团，同他们热烈握手，拥抱他们。
    刚果（布）青年足球队以三比一打败了曾经胜过刚果（布）另一个球队的刚果（利）足球队。一位青年足球队队员说出了他们这次获胜的原因：“在访问中国期间，我们意识到，中国体育界同志受到毛泽东思想的哺育。我们看到他们的集体英雄主义，他们的团结、互助，和高度的纪律性、自觉性，尤其是看到毛泽东思想鼓舞的革命坚定性。我们向他们学习，我们就更加勇敢，更加坚决，更加熟练。我们知道，我们必须为我们的祖国、人民和革命踢球。”
