The French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) central organ, "New Humanity Daily," published an article titled "Study Mao Zedong Thought and Act According to Mao Zedong Thought" on December 8. The article emphasizes that "the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the criterion for judging whether a person is a true revolutionary or a false revolutionary, a Marxist-Leninist or a revisionist."

The article stresses the necessity for Marxist-Leninists to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought and to propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses of laboring people.

The article states: "To unify thought with Mao Zedong Thought is the task of all Marxist-Leninists in the world. It is not enough to just know that Mao Zedong is the contemporary Lenin; one must use persuasive methods to spread, propagate, and explain the common wealth of the peoples of all countries in the world—Mao Zedong's works."

The article further states: "Propagating Mao Zedong Thought is promoting revolution. This is a task that falls on all Marxist-Leninists."

The newspaper writes: "Chairman Mao's theory on class, class contradictions, and class struggle in the socialist stage is a new development of Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee against revisionism and the struggle against imperialism. This is the guarantee to carry the revolution through to the end. Mao Zedong Thought is the most advanced and correct thought of the proletarian class."

In discussing the importance Chinese people place on studying the "Three Articles" (i.e., "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains"), "New Humanity Daily" writes: "The three articles written by Chairman Mao are the guide for the Chinese people in transforming their worldview. The 'Three Articles' help them fight against individualism, be loyal to the collective, and be loyal to the revolution."

"New Humanity Daily" also praises the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese revolutionary masses, stating: "Mao Zedong summed up this bold revolutionary spirit of the proletariat in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' This spirit inspires millions of Chinese people to criticize the old world. This spirit should be our example for French Marxist-Leninists to learn from."

    法国《新人道报》强调活学活用毛主席著作
    学习毛泽东思想　按毛泽东思想办事
    据新华社巴黎电　法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）中央机关报《新人道报》八日发表一篇题为《学习毛泽东思想，按毛泽东思想办事》的文章。文章强调指出：“对待毛泽东思想的态度，是判断一个人是真革命者还是假革命者、是马克思列宁主义者还是修正主义者的标准。”
    这篇文章强调了马克思列宁主义者活学活用毛泽东思想、并在广大的劳动群众中宣传毛泽东思想的必要性。
    文章说：“用毛泽东思想来统一思想，这是全世界马克思列宁主义者的任务。光懂得毛泽东是当代的列宁是不够的，必须用说服的办法传播、宣传、解释全世界各国人民的共同财富——毛泽东著作”。
    文章还说：“宣传毛泽东思想就是促进革命”，“这是落在一切马克思列宁主义者身上的任务。”
    这家报纸写道：“毛主席关于社会主义阶段的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的理论，是马克思列宁主义的新发展”，“毛泽东思想是反对修正主义、反对帝国主义斗争的根本保证。这是把革命进行到底的保证。毛泽东思想是最先进的阶级无产阶级的正确思想。”
    《新人道报》在谈到中国人民重视“老三篇”的学习时写道：毛主席所写的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》三篇文章，是中国人民改造世界观的指针。“老三篇”使他们同个人主义作斗争，忠于集体，忠于革命。
    《新人道报》还赞扬中国革命群众所表现的无产阶级革命造反精神，文章写道：“毛泽东用一句话来概括这种大胆的无产阶级革命造反精神，即‘造反有理’，这种精神鼓舞着数以百万计的中国人起来批判旧世界，这种精神应当成为我们法国马克思列宁主义者学习的榜样。”
