In a middle school in Entuman, Sudan, the Sudan-China Friendship Association was recently established. One day, some leaders of this association brought back four large portraits of Chairman Mao and a batch of Chairman Mao's works for their classmates. Upon seeing them, the students immediately became excited. They held up the portraits of Chairman Mao and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

In many schools and professional organizations in the three cities of Khartoum, North Khartoum, and Entuman, many members of the Sudan-China Friendship Association are also eagerly searching for portraits and works of Chairman Mao, as well as books about the Chinese Cultural Revolution. After reading Chairman Mao's works, a student wrote in an article: "Revolutionary people, only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought, can they defeat American imperialism and also criticize modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Union leadership. Mao Zedong Thought is a great development of Marxism-Leninism; it is not only applicable to China but also to other parts of the world."

A middle school in Sudan published a wall newspaper introducing the revolutionary and construction achievements of China, featuring an article enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao: "Revolutionary people around the world enthusiastically acclaim Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding beacon. They regard Chairman Mao's works as extremely valuable revolutionary guides." "Revolutionary people around the world love and respect Chairman Mao because he holds high the torch of revolution, guiding the people forward and truly representing the interests of the working people."

Recently, a student at Khartoum Technical Institute, after reading the telegram signed by Chairman Mao to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "Chairman Mao's words are all truth. I completely agree with his views." He also said, "Chairman Mao said, 'Our friends are all over the world.' Yes, as for me, I am one of your friends in Sudan. I have infinite respect for you, Chairman Mao. Because of your great thoughts and great revolutionary actions, you have set the most brilliant example for revolutionary people all over the world."

Recently, a wall newspaper dedicated to introducing China was published in the club of Khartoum University. One of the articles introduced the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. The article stated: "The Cultural Revolution will forever be an important milestone of our era and a prominent sign of the development of the world proletarian revolution."

Recently, a university student in Khartoum, while talking to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, took out a Chairman Mao badge given to him by a friend and said, "This Chairman Mao badge is my most cherished possession. I carry it with me and often look at it. Every time I see it, I gain boundless spiritual strength." He also said meaningfully, "Mao Zedong Thought is like the rising sun in the east, illuminating the hearts of revolutionary people around the world."

He continued, saying that he had loved Chairman Mao since his middle school days. He and his two brothers ran to many bookstores and bought a Chinese magazine featuring a portrait of Chairman Mao. He specially cut out the portrait of Chairman Mao from the magazine and pasted it in his room so that he could see Chairman Mao every day. When his father, a tenant farmer, found out that this portrait was of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, he immediately said with joy, "Chairman Mao is not only the savior of the Chinese people; oppressed people all over the world need him."

    苏丹学生热情歌颂毛主席
    毛泽东思想代表了世界劳动人民的利益
    在苏丹恩图曼的一所中学里，最近成立了苏丹—中国友好协会。这个协会的一些领导人有一天给同学们带回了四大张毛主席像和一批毛主席著作。同学们见了立即欢腾起来。他们举起毛主席像，兴奋地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
  “毛主席万岁！”
    在喀土穆、北喀土穆和恩图曼三镇的许多学校和职业团体里，许多苏丹—中国友好协会会员也纷纷寻找毛主席的像片和著作以及关于中国文化大革命的书籍。一位学生在读了毛主席的著作之后，在一篇文章中写道：“革命的人民，只有掌握了毛泽东思想，才能打败美帝国主义，也才能批判以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。”“毛泽东思想是马列主义的巨大发展，它不仅适用于中国，也适用于世界其他地方。”
    苏丹一所中学出版了介绍中国革命和建设成就的墙报，登了一篇热情颂扬毛主席的文章说：“全世界各国革命人民热烈地欢呼毛主席的思想是他们的指路明灯。他们把毛主席的著作看成是非常宝贵的革命指南。”“全世界的革命人民无限热爱和崇敬毛主席，是因为他高举着革命的火炬，给人民指引前进的方向，真正代表了劳动人民的利益。”
    喀土穆技术学院的一位学生最近在读了毛主席签署的中共中央给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电之后对新华社记者说：“毛主席的话字字句句是真理。我完全同意他的观点。”他还说：“毛主席说，‘我们的朋友遍天下。’是的，就以我来说，我就是你们在苏丹的一位朋友。我对您，毛主席，无限崇敬。因为您的伟大思想和伟大的革命行动，为全世界革命人民树立了最光辉的榜样。”
    在喀土穆大学的俱乐部里，最近出版了一期专门介绍有关中国情况的墙报。其中有一篇稿件介绍了由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义。这篇文章写道：“文化大革命将永远是我们时代的重要里程碑，是世界无产阶级革命发展的显著标志。”
    喀土穆的一位大学生最近在同新华社记者谈话时，从口袋里掏出了一枚他的朋友送给他的毛主席像章，并说：“这枚毛主席像章是我最心爱的东西。我随身带着它，经常看着它。每当看到它，我就增添了无穷的精神力量。”他还意味深长地说：“毛泽东思想像东方的朝阳，照亮了世界革命人民的心灵。”
    他接着说，他早在中学念书时，就热爱毛主席。他和他的两个兄弟一起跑过很多家书店，买到了一本上面刊有毛主席像的中国杂志。他特地把毛主席的像从杂志上剪下来，贴在自己的房间里，以便天天都能看到毛主席。当他的父亲——一位佃农知道这张像就是中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的像时，立刻高兴地说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的大救星，世界上被压迫的人民都需要他。”　新华社记者（附图片）
