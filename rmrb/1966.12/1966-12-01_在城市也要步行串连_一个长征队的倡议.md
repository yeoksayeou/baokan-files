We, the 59 members of the "Revolutionary Long March Team" from the Taiyuan Health School in Shanxi, with hearts full of boundless love for Chairman Mao, have followed Chairman Mao's instructions to undergo tempering in the midst of great storms and hardships. We have come to Beijing, the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, on foot. We have undergone a test in these harsh conditions.

Upon arriving in Beijing, the environment is different. There are smooth asphalt roads, and cars and trams are constantly flowing. The different environment poses new questions for us: should we squeeze onto the cars, or should we insist on walking and linking up? To maintain the spirit of hard work and simplicity like the old Red Army, regardless of the environment, we unanimously decided that even in Beijing, we will not take cars and will insist on walking all the way.

For more than ten days, all the members of the Long March Team have done just that. We went to Peking University to link up, and even though the journey was far, we walked back and forth. On November 14, four female comrades went to visit the clay sculpture group "The Rent Collection Courtyard." After the visit, it was already after 7 PM. At that time, many people were queuing up to take the bus, but they still insisted on walking back to the reception station.

We deeply feel that walking and linking up, although it takes more time and is more tiring, allows us to come into broader and deeper contact with the masses, to get to know society better, to better feel the revolutionary atmosphere of the capital, and to better temper our revolutionary will.

With full revolutionary enthusiasm, we propose to all revolutionary students and teachers who have come to Beijing: Inherit the revolutionary spirit of the Long March, and walk and link up in the cities. We hope that revolutionary students and teachers from all places will actively respond to this initiative.

    在城市也要步行串连
    ——一个长征队的倡议
    我们山西太谷卫生学校“革命长征队”的五十九名战士，怀着对毛主席无比热爱的心情，遵照毛主席关于在大风大浪里经受锻炼的教导，徒步来到了无产阶级文化大革命的中心——北京。我们在艰苦的环境中经受了一次考验。
    来到北京，环境不同了。平坦的柏油路，川流不息的汽车、电车，不同的环境向我们提出了新的问题：是挤着坐车呢，还是坚持徒步串连呢？为了像老红军那样，在任何环境中都能保持艰苦朴素的作风，我们一致决定在北京进行串连也不坐车，坚持步行到底。
    十多天来，我们全体长征队员就是这样做的。我们到北京大学串连，路途较远，也是徒步来回。十一月十四日，四个女同学去参观泥塑群像《收租院》，参观完已是下午七点多了。当时，许多人都在排队等车，她们还是坚持徒步回到接待站。
    我们深切地体会到：徒步串连，虽然要多费一些时间，也比较累，但是可以更广泛、更深入地接触群众，熟悉社会，更好地感受首都的革命气氛，更好地锻炼我们的革命意志。
    我们以满腔的革命热情，向全体来京的革命师生提出倡议：继承红军长征的革命精神，在城市里也要徒步进行革命大串连。我们希望各地革命师生积极响应这一倡议。
