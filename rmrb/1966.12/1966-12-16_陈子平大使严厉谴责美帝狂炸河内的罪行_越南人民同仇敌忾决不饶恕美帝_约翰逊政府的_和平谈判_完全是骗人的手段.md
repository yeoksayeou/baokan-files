Ambassador Chen Ziping today held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists, severely condemning the U.S. imperialists' recent continuous and frenzied bombing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi. The ambassador emphasized that the U.S. imperialists' new adventurism will not shake the resolve of the Vietnamese people but will only intensify the hatred of the people of North and South Vietnam, and will deal the U.S. imperialists an even more powerful and painful blow.

Ambassador Chen Ziping told the journalists present that the U.S. imperialists' bombing of Hanoi, the heart of Vietnam, is a very despicable and blatant act of aggression, a very barbaric and shameless act of war, a new step in escalating and expanding the war, and a highly arrogant provocation to all peace-loving and justice-seeking people around the world. He said that this is also the desperate struggle of the U.S. imperialists on the brink of death.

The ambassador pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' frenzied acts of aggression are a result of their military invasions suffering repeated defeats, their "peace talks" charade being exposed and rejected by the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, and their military plans and political conspiracies in Honolulu and Manila completely failing. This adventurous and brutal action further exposes the fact that the Johnson administration's "peace talks" are a deceitful ploy.

The ambassador said that the U.S. imperialists think they can subdue the Vietnamese people with bombs, but the Vietnamese people's resolve and determination to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation are unwavering. This resolve has been reiterated in the statement issued by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 14. He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' new escalation of the war by bombing Hanoi will only make the hatred of the 31 million Vietnamese people against the U.S. imperialists burn even more fiercely. The Vietnamese people and people around the world, united in their hatred of the enemy, will never forgive the U.S. imperialists.

Ambassador Chen Ziping said that the Vietnamese people are full of confidence in their just cause. The Vietnamese people are determined to fight and determined to win. From north to south, the Vietnamese people are striving to fulfill Chairman Hu's sacred call on July 17, 1966, advancing bravely and steadfastly to achieve complete victory in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The press conference also distributed the statement issued by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 14, 1966.

    陈子平大使严厉谴责美帝狂炸河内的罪行
    越南人民同仇敌忾决不饶恕美帝
    约翰逊政府的“和平谈判”完全是骗人的手段
    新华社十五日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使陈子平今天举行中外记者招待会，严厉谴责美帝国主义最近连续疯狂轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内的滔天罪行。大使强调指出，美帝国主义的新的冒险行动，绝不能使越南人民动摇，只会增加越南北方和南方人民的仇恨，并给美帝国主义以更猛、更痛的打击。
    陈子平大使向参加招待会的中外记者指出，美帝国主义轰炸越南的心脏河内，是非常卑鄙和露骨的侵略行为，是非常野蛮和无耻的战争行为，是加强和扩大战争的新的冒险步骤，是对全世界一切爱好和平和主持正义的人民的极其蛮横的挑衅。他说，这也是美帝国主义临近死亡的挣扎。
    大使指出，美帝国主义的疯狂的侵略行动，是它的军事侵略一再遭到惨败，是它的“和谈”骗局被越南人民和全世界人民已经识破和唾弃，以及它在檀香山和马尼拉策划的各项军事计划和政治阴谋彻底破产之后采取的。这个冒险和残暴的行动，更加清楚地暴露了约翰逊政府的“和平谈判”，是骗人的手段。
    大使说，美帝国主义以为用炸弹可以使越南人民屈服，可是，越南人民抗美救国斗争的意志和决心是坚定不移的。这种意志已经在越南民主共和国政府十四日发表的声明中再一次得到表明。他指出，美帝国主义轰炸河内的新的战争“升级”行动，将使三千一百万越南人民焚烧美帝国主义的仇恨怒火燃烧得更加旺盛。越南人民和全世界人民同仇敌忾，是决不会饶恕美帝国主义的。
    陈子平大使说，越南人民对自己的正义事业充满了必胜的信心。越南人民决心战斗和决心取胜。越南人民从北到南，正努力实现胡主席一九六六年七月十七日发出的神圣号召，英勇坚定地前进，争取抗美救国斗争的完全胜利。
    招待会上还散发了越南民主共和国政府在一九六六年十二月十四日发表的声明。
