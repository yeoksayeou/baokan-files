Japanese audiences eagerly visit our exhibition, enthusiastically praising the Cultural Revolution

Only Chairman Mao has the courage to launch this revolution of world significance

The Red Guards led by Chairman Mao have become a million-strong army charging into the old world

		NEW DELHI, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese people from various places continue to enthusiastically visit the China Economic and Trade Exhibition held in Nagoya. In the two weeks since the exhibition opened to the afternoon of December 4, the number of visitors has reached over 1.56 million.

		At 2:45 p.m. on December 4, when the staff announced through the loudspeaker that the number of visitors had reached 1.5 million, the broad masses of spectators inside and outside the venue, along with Chinese and Japanese staff, enthusiastically applauded and cheered together.

		December 4 was the third Sunday since the exhibition opened. On that day alone, more than 310,000 visitors came, including workers, peasants, and fishermen. Many women pushing baby carriages or carrying children, as well as elderly people with white hair, also came to visit the exhibition. Many visitors lingered at the entrance, gazing with boundless reverence at a radiant portrait of Chairman Mao hanging there. A female teacher who was about to go to China to participate in the second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Rally said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest sun. As soon as we see his portrait, we feel his warmth and strength. I hope to see Chairman Mao in China."

		A group of university students who visited China this autumn stood at the entrance of the exhibition hall and, upon seeing the Chinese staff, took their hands and sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" in spirited Chinese. This is their favorite song.

		Many visitors stood intently in front of large photos of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards and other revolutionary masses several times, listening to the explanations of the guides. An elderly doctor from Mie Prefecture said, "Although the Red Guards are ordinary young people, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, they have become a million-strong army fearlessly charging into the old world." Another man named Matsuoka Yoshihiko, an 81-year-old, wrote in the guestbook: "Only Chairman Mao has the courage to launch this revolution of world significance. I hope this revolution will achieve even greater results. Long live Chairman Mao." A female middle school student said, "The Cultural Revolution is very good. We support the Chinese Red Guards and hope you will work hard in the Cultural Revolution!"

		To meet the urgent demand of Japanese friends to read "Quotations from Chairman Mao," the Japanese friends of the China Exhibition Japan Cooperation Book Sales Committee specially set up two places in front of the exhibition hall to sell "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Since this red treasure book was published in Japan on November 20, many people have been eager to buy it every day.

		Japanese friends who insist on the correct stance also sell magazines in the exhibition hall's bookstore that propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and small booklets published by the headquarters of the (orthodox) Japan-China Friendship Association that expose the attempts of a small group of Soviet revisionist followers in Japan to sabotage the Japan-China friendship movement. Those who sabotage Japan-China friendship, ashamed and angry, shamelessly slandered and, through infiltrators in the book sales committee, caused trouble and published fallacies attacking the China Economic and Trade Exhibition Team in the newspapers. The majority of members in the book sales committee who maintain Japan-China friendship angrily expelled the two troublemakers from the committee, exposing the plot of Soviet revisionists' followers in Japan.

    日本观众踊跃参观我展览会热情赞颂文化大革命
    毛主席才有这样巨大魄力发动这场革命
    毛主席领导的红卫兵已成为向旧世界冲锋陷阵的百万雄师
    新华社五日讯　名古屋消息：日本各地人民继续热情洋溢地参观在名古屋举行的中国经济贸易展览会。从这个展览会开幕到四日下午的两周内，观众已经达到一百五十六万多人。
    四日下午二时四十五分，当会场工作人员通过扩音器宣布观众总数已达一百五十万人时，会场内外的广大观众和中日两国工作人员，一起热烈地鼓掌欢呼。
    四日是展览会开幕以来的第三个星期天。仅仅这一天的观众就超过三十一万人，其中包括工人、农民、渔民。许多推着儿童车或者抱着孩子的妇女，以及白发苍苍的老人也赶到展览会参观。许多观众久久停留在入门处，抱着无限崇敬的心情仰望着悬挂在那里的一幅光辉四射的毛主席绣像。一位即将到中国参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢的女教师说，毛主席是最伟大的太阳。我们一看见他的像，就感受到他的温暖和力量。我希望能够在中国看到毛主席。
    今年秋天曾经到中国参观访问过的一批大学生，在会场门口一见到中国的工作人员，就挽起他们的手，用中文精神抖擞地唱起《大海航行靠舵手》。这是他们最爱唱的一支歌曲。
    许多观众在伟大的毛主席几次接见红卫兵和其他革命群众的大幅照片前，聚精会神地听解说员的讲解。一位来自三重县的老医生说：“红卫兵虽然是普通的青少年，但是有毛泽东的英明领导，就变成了无所畏惧地向旧世界冲锋陷阵的百万雄师。”另一位名叫松冈义彦的八十一岁的老人在留言簿上写道：只有毛泽东主席才有这样巨大的魄力，发动这场具有世界意义的文化大革命。他表示希望这场革命取得更伟大的成果。他祝毛主席万寿无疆。一位女中学生说：“文化大革命好得很。中国的红卫兵，我们支持你们，希望你们在文化大革命中加油干！”
    为了满足日本朋友读到《毛主席语录》的迫切要求，中国展览会日本协力会书籍贩卖委员会的日本朋友，特地在展览馆门前设立了两个专售《毛主席语录》的地方。这本为日本人民渴望得到的红色宝书，自从十一月二十日在日本出版以来，每天都有许多人踊跃购买。
    坚持正确立场的日本朋友，还在会场内的书店里，出售在日本出版的宣传毛泽东思想的杂志，出售日中友好协会（正统）总部编印的揭露苏联修正主义在日本的一小撮追随者企图破坏日中友好运动的小册子。那些日中友好的破坏者恼羞成怒，竟然恬不知耻地大肆谩骂，并且通过混入书籍贩卖委员会中的破坏分子就这件事寻衅捣乱，在报纸上发表攻击中国经济贸易展览团的谬论。书籍贩卖委员会中维护日中友好的大多数成员，愤怒把两名破坏分子赶出这个委员会，揭露了苏联修正主义者在日本的追随者的阴谋。
