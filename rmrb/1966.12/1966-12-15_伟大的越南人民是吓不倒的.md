The great Vietnamese people are indomitable.

The Johnson government, on December 13 and 14, consecutively dispatched American bandit planes to bomb and strafe the capital city of Hanoi and its suburbs in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, killing and injuring over a hundred innocent civilians. This is a new heinous crime committed by American imperialism against the entire Vietnamese people, a new and extremely serious act of escalating the war. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has issued a statement strongly denouncing this new act of aggression by the American bandits to the world. The Chinese people, filled with immense anger, sternly condemn American imperialism and express the most resolute support for the just stance of the Vietnamese people.

Since December, in just half a month, American air bandits have bombed and strafed the city of Hanoi and its suburbs four times. Each time, they have become more brazen, even developing to the point of bombing and strafing the diplomatic district in Hanoi. This is not only a mad invasion of the Vietnamese people but also a reckless provocation to the people of Asia and the world who love peace.

Recently, American imperialism has been pushing the so-called "Christmas truce," "bombing halt," and "peace talks" farce. The Johnson government arrogantly attempts to use the evil means of intensifying the bombing of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to force the Vietnamese people to kneel and accept the American peace talks trap. The Johnson government wants to use bombs to create a "peace talks" situation.

The Johnson government dares to take such mad actions because it has received active encouragement and close coordination from the Soviet revisionist leadership clique. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has been vigorously pushing the "three helps" policy on the Vietnam issue. It helps the United States peddle the peace talks trap, helps the United States escalate the war, and helps the United States madly oppose China, attempting to sabotage the great rear area of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America and national salvation. Recently, the United States and the Soviet Union have been closely colluding, pushing the conspiracy of "bombing to force peace talks." The facts once again prove that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is the number one accomplice of American imperialism in extinguishing the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people.

However, no matter how mad American imperialism is, no matter how many bombs it drops on Vietnamese soil, the Vietnamese people will never surrender. The Vietnamese people are fearless warriors standing at the forefront of the anti-American struggle. They have already sworn to drive out all American invaders from their land and to complete the sacred mission of thorough liberation and national reunification. In the face of such a great and brave people, any pressure is utterly ineffective. The statement of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 14 declared resolutely: "Facing the barbaric attack by American bandits on the capital city of Hanoi, the military and civilians of the entire country, north and south, and the military and civilians of the capital, will deepen their hatred, strengthen their unity, advance bravely, and decisively defeat the American invading bandits, completing the glorious national mission." This is a powerful response to the American imperialism's war blackmail and the conspiracy of "bombing to force peace talks."

Chairman Mao said: The rampancy of the dark forces not only indicates that these dark forces still have strength, but also indicates their last struggle and the people's gradual approach to victory.

American imperialism's dispatch of planes to barbarically bomb Hanoi is a desperate struggle. Its war and peace tactics have both hit a wall. Nearly 370,000 American invading troops are bogged down in the battlefields of South Vietnam, passively taking blows, and suffering heavy losses. The "bombing halt and peace talks" and "bombing to force peace talks" tactics have been repeatedly tried, but to no avail. They cannot win in battle, nor can they deceive. Sending planes to bomb Hanoi is precisely a manifestation of American imperialism's extreme weakness and inner fear.

The seven hundred million Chinese people, who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have an unshakable stance of aiding Vietnam and resisting America. Comrade Lin Biao recently pointed out: "The current focus of the struggle is in Vietnam. We have made all the preparations. We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support our Vietnamese comrades in carrying the war of resistance against America and national salvation to the end." The Chinese people are closely watching the developments in Vietnam. We firmly believe: American imperialism will be defeated, and the Vietnamese people will be victorious!

    伟大的越南人民是吓不倒的
    约翰逊政府于十二月十三日、十四日，接连地派出美国强盗飞机，轰炸和扫射越南民主共和国首都河内市区和郊区，炸死炸伤和平居民一百多人。这是美帝国主义对全体越南人民犯下的新的滔天罪行，是一个极为严重的新的战争“升级”行动。越南民主共和国政府已经发表声明，向全世界强烈控诉美国强盗这一新的侵略罪行。中国人民怀着无比的愤怒，严正声讨美帝国主义，并且对越南人民的正义立场表示最坚决的支持。
    十二月份以来，仅仅半个月之内，美国空中强盗已经四次轰炸和扫射河内市区和郊区。而且，一次比一次更加猖狂，甚至发展到轰炸和扫射河内的外国使馆区。这不仅是对越南人民的疯狂侵略，也是对亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的狂妄挑衅。
    近来，美帝国主义正在大搞所谓圣诞节“休战”、“停炸”、“和谈”的把戏。约翰逊政府妄想用加强轰炸越南民主共和国首都的罪恶手段，来迫使越南人民屈膝投降，接受美国的和谈骗局。约翰逊政府就是要用炸弹压出一个“和谈”的局面来。
    约翰逊政府所以敢于采取这样疯狂的行动，是由于得到苏联修正主义领导集团的积极鼓励和紧密配合。苏联修正主义领导集团在越南问题上卖力地推行“三帮”政策，它帮助美国推销和谈骗局，帮助美国加紧战争“升级”，并且帮助美国疯狂反华，企图破坏越南人民抗美救国战争的大后方。最近，美苏正在加紧勾结，推行“以炸迫和”的阴谋。事实再一次证明，苏联修正主义领导集团是美帝国主义扑灭越南人民革命烈火的头号帮凶。
    但是，不管美帝国主义怎样疯狂，不管它在越南土地上丢多少炸弹，越南人民决不会屈服。越南人民是站在反美斗争最前线的大无畏的战士。他们早已立下誓言，一定要把美国侵略者全部赶出国土，一定要完成彻底解放和祖国统一的神圣事业。在这样伟大的英勇的人民面前，任何压力都是毫无作用的。越南民主共和国政府十二月十四日的声明斩钉截铁地宣告：“面对着美国强盗野蛮袭击首都河内市的滔天罪行，全国北南两方军民，首都军民，要进一步加深仇恨，加强团结，英勇前进，决战决胜美国侵略强盗，完成民族的光荣任务。”这是对美帝国主义战争讹诈和“以炸迫和”阴谋的强有力回答。
    毛主席说：黑暗势力的这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。
    美帝国主义派飞机野蛮轰炸河内，是一种绝望的挣扎。它的战“和”两手，都碰了壁。近三十七万美国侵略军陷在南越战场上，被动挨打，损失惨重。“停炸诱和”、“以炸迫和”，翻来复去搞，结果都白费劲。打又打不赢，骗又骗不了。派飞机炸河内，恰恰是美帝国主义十分虚弱的表现，恰恰是它色厉内荏的表现。
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的七亿中国人民援越抗美的立场，是坚定不移的。林彪同志不久前指出：“当前斗争的焦点在越南。我们已经作好了一切准备。我们决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民把抗美救国的战争进行到底。”中国人民密切注视着越南局势的发展。我们坚定地相信：美帝国主义必败，越南人民必胜！
