Tanzanian Friend Praises the Internationalist Spirit of Chinese Revolutionary Youth
Red Guards Guided by Chairman Mao Have a Global Revolutionary Outlook

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, Kabenja Nsa Kayesi, a Tanzanian journalist who recently visited China, spoke to reporters in Dar es Salaam upon his return. He shared his impressions of the Chinese Red Guards.

He praised them, saying, "The Red Guards left a deep impression on me. They are brave, they understand the global situation and hate American imperialism and its lackeys. They love Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Chinese people."

He said, "The Red Guards' boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao deeply moved me. During my conversations with the Red Guards in China, they all told me that Chairman Mao is the red sun in their hearts."

He said, "All the Red Guards diligently study Chairman Mao's thoughts and teachings, and they are always ready to serve the people. I have personally seen them working with farmers."

He said, "In my conversations with the Red Guards, they all expressed their firm support for the national liberation struggles in Africa. He emphasized, 'This is very exciting and a great encouragement. It shows that the Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao not only educates young people to care about their own national interests but also to care about the interests of all oppressed and revolutionary peoples around the world. This also proves the great proletarian internationalist spirit of the Chinese people.'"

He also enthusiastically praised the Red Guards' revolutionary actions of touring the country to connect with the revolution, spreading Chairman Mao's thoughts among workers and peasants, and learning from the broad masses of laboring people.

    坦桑朋友赞扬中国革命小将的国际主义精神
    毛主席教导的红卫兵胸怀世界革命
    据新华社讯　不久前曾到中国访问的坦桑尼亚新闻工作者卡本加·恩萨·凯西，回国后在达累斯萨拉姆向记者发表谈话，谈到他对中国红卫兵的印象。
    他赞扬说：“红卫兵给了我深刻的印象，他们有勇气，他们了解世界局势和痛恨美帝国主义及其帮凶。他们热爱毛主席、共产党和中国人民。”
    他说：红卫兵无限热爱伟大的领袖毛主席，使他深为感动。他在中国同红卫兵谈话时，所有的红卫兵都对他说，毛主席是他们心中的红太阳。
    他说，所有的红卫兵都刻苦学习毛主席的思想和教导，他们随时准备为人民服务。他曾经亲眼看到他们和农民一起劳动。
    他说，他在同红卫兵交谈中，所有的红卫兵都表示坚决支持非洲的民族解放斗争。他强调指出：“这是非常令人兴奋的，是一个极大的鼓舞。这表明，毛主席领导的中国共产党，不仅教育青年要关心自己的民族利益，而且要关心全世界所有被压迫人民和革命人民的利益。这也证明了中国人民伟大的无产阶级国际主义精神。”
    他还热烈赞扬红卫兵在全国进行革命串连，在工农中宣传毛主席思想，同时向广大劳动人民学习的革命行动。
