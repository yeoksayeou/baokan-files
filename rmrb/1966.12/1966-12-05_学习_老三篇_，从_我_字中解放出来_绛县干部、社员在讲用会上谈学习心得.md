The people of Shaanxi Province's Jiang County are enthusiastically responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call to elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. They particularly regard the "Three Articles" as a motto to study. Many community members not only memorize the "Three Articles" but also use Zhang Zedong, Bai Qiu'en, and the Old Man Moving Mountains as mirrors and rulers, examining themselves daily and measuring themselves daily, consciously undergoing ideological transformation. Therefore, people's spiritual outlook has greatly changed, and new people and new deeds are emerging in large numbers.

Below are the study experiences shared by several cadres and community members from Jiang County at a recent "Three Articles" study meeting.

"The 'Three Articles' Helped Me Step Out of the Family's Small World"

Dong He Shui Brigade of Dajiao Commune's Dong Zhi Hua said: I am 43 years old. Due to having many children at home, I was always busy with household chores, running around all day. In the past few years, not to mention participating in collective production labor, I rarely attended meetings. Last year, I studied the "Three Articles" with many community members and felt that I was not even a bit comparable to Zhang Zedong, Bai Qiu'en, and the Old Man Moving Mountains. Chairman Mao said: "The women of China are a great human resource. We must tap this resource and strive to build a great socialist country." However, I was always stuck in my own house, sitting on the kang, circling the stove, guarding the door, how could I contribute to building socialism? I thought about it from all angles and felt something was wrong. I am a poor peasant, I must listen to Chairman Mao's words, contribute to building socialism, and become a person beneficial to the people.

But who will do the housework? Mending clothes, washing socks, cooking, feeding chickens and pigs, taking care of children... it never ends. I brought these problems back to study the "Three Articles." Bai Qiu'en came to China from afar to help the Chinese revolution, why can't I step out of the house? The Old Man Moving Mountains can move two big mountains, why can't I overcome the difficulty of having many children? Zhang Zedong sacrificed his life for the revolution, why can't I give up this family? Thinking about it, my courage grew. Chairman Mao said: "Resolutely determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." I decided to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, mustered my courage, and stepped out of the house.

How to solve the household problems? I convened a family meeting and discussed two methods: The first method is to have everyone in the family pitch in and do the housework together. Let the older children take care of the younger ones. When cooking, the husband stokes the fire, I knead the dough, and the second child fetches water. After eating, the second child feeds the chickens, the third child feeds the pigs, everyone does their own chores. The second method is to plan and arrange the housework early. Some chores are done on Sundays when the children are off, and some are done in the evenings. This way, I can free up time to participate in collective production labor.

Now, I attend work every day. By the end of September this year, I have already completed over 230 workdays, and the housework is also well arranged. I also insist on studying Chairman Mao's works every day. Reading Chairman Mao's books, I feel that my thoughts have progressed, and I have boundless energy. In the past, I could only see the small family, thinking about the small things under my nose. Now, I think about and see the big things of socialism, class struggle, production struggle, and opposing imperialism and modern revisionism.

"We Overcame the Difficulties with Mao Zedong Thought"

Nanfeng Commune's Huaiquan Brigade's Liu Jinxue said: I come from a poor peasant family and am 26 years old. I hate the old society and love Chairman Mao. Over the past two years, I have read through the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" (Volume B) and often use the "Three Articles" to examine my thoughts and actions, determined to contribute everything for the revolution.

In the autumn of 1965, when building the "May 1st Canal" in Lizeyu, our militia platoon's task was to blast an 80-meter-long section of the canal in our work section, which was over 100 meters high on the steep cliffs. This was the most dangerous section of the entire site, requiring ropes to suspend people in mid-air to drill holes and set off explosives. In some sections, in the middle of the cliffs, people in mid-air could not reach the rocks, and had to use the "flying man" method, swinging back and forth to reach the rocks to drill holes and set off explosives. Some people saw this situation and were a bit timid. I organized everyone to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," which increased our courage and strength. I thought, the steep cliffs are also a paper tiger, there is nothing to be afraid of, as long as we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, we will achieve victory. Therefore, I volunteered to go down first to drill holes and set off explosives.

Once, we set 48 charges, and according to the signal to set off the explosives, I lit all 48 charges and then quickly ran away. After running about 20 meters, I suddenly saw five community members delivering grain from below the bend, driving the livestock into the danger zone. It was too late to call them to avoid it. I was so anxious that I was sweating all over. At this moment, Chairman Mao seemed to be saying to me: "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." So, I rushed back without hesitation to pull out the fuse. At that time, my mind had only one thought: quickly pull out all the fuse cords! Militia member Jin Jiguang also rushed with me to pull them out. We quickly pulled out all the fuse cords. When I threw away the last fuse cord with the detonator, the detonator exploded in mid-air. How dangerous! If it had been delayed by even a second, a serious accident would have occurred.

In the blasting project, we constantly studied Chairman Mao's works, resolutely followed Chairman Mao's words, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In the bitterly cold days of the ninth lunar month, we overcame the cold, strong winds, danger, and other difficulties and successfully completed the canal-opening task.

I deeply feel that only those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the wisest, bravest, and have the greatest fighting power.

"Feeding Livestock for the Revolution"

Nanfeng Commune's Nanzhu Brigade's Qiao Ziming said: In the autumn of 1964, the brigade selected me to be the livestock keeper. At that time, the livestock shed was washed away by water, and the brigade was busy with planting wheat and harvesting, so they couldn't build it. The weather was also gradually getting colder. I lived in the livestock shed and froze for a few days, and my thoughts wavered. I brought this problem to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao called on everyone to learn from Norman Bethune's selfless spirit of serving others. I thought, if I put myself first in everything, how could this be following Chairman Mao's words? I am a poor peasant, and from a young age, I worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord, suffering from cold and hunger. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao came, and I was liberated and lived the happy life of today. But my thoughts have not been liberated from the "self," isn't this forgetting my roots? Chairman Mao said: "Without poor peasants, there would be no revolution." The revolutionary work is in front of us, who else will do it if not us poor peasants? Thinking of this, I decided to continue and do it well.

I visited the model livestock keeper Wang Qishan, learned from his good experience, and carefully fed the livestock. Seeing the livestock gaining weight day by day, I was very happy.

In addition to feeding my own livestock, I also helped another livestock keeper fetch water, lay down bedding, and cut alfalfa. He thanked me. I said: "I am not just doing this for you, we are all for the revolution, no one should thank anyone, we should all thank Chairman Mao! If I hadn't read Chairman Mao's books, even if you gave me work points, I wouldn't help you do it!"

To raise the livestock well, I and other livestock keepers together researched a method to treat prolapse in livestock. Sometimes, brother brigades asked me to treat livestock diseases, and even when my waist pain acted up, I insisted on going. Sometimes, I ran over 60 miles to help brother brigades in other counties treat livestock diseases. Someone praised me for this. In fact, Norman Bethune came to China from afar, dedicating his precious life to the Chinese revolution. I only walked this little distance and did this little thing, compared to Norman Bethune, I am far behind! In the future, I will act according to Chairman Mao's words and contribute greater strength to the revolution.

"Following Chairman Mao's Words, Daring to Shoulder Heavy Burdens"

Chengguan Commune's Yunan Brigade's Li Suying said: During this autumn harvest, the community members of our third production team, based on my and Wang Suyun, Sang Sufang, Si Suiping, and Gao Suju's daily performance, selected us five young women to be political workers, team leaders, deputy team leaders, and women's team leaders. We few girls gathered together to discuss. Some said, our third production team has barren land and backward production. We are on average less than 17 years old, young and inexperienced, we can't do it well. I said, our team has few male laborers, we are all daughters of poor peasants, who will manage the collective production if not us? We should do as Chairman Mao says. After a discussion, we all agreed that since we have studied the "Three Articles," we should serve the people completely and thoroughly like Zhang Zedong. This heavy burden, we will shoulder it. The brigade party branch secretary and poor and lower-middle peasants came to encourage and support us. With the party's leadership and the support of the poor and lower-middle peasants, our confidence grew even stronger.

The burden has been shouldered, but how to shoulder it well? When we were selected, it was the busiest time for autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing, with mountains of farm work piled up, but there were few laborers and we couldn't keep up. What to do? At this time, we remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." We decided to first organize the community members to study the "Three Articles," raise awareness through study, and carry out ideological revolutionization. As a result, the community's spiritual outlook changed greatly, and everyone expressed their willingness to learn from the Old Man Moving Mountains' spirit, determined to overcome difficulties and change the backward face of the production team. Community members voluntarily advanced the work start time, and some elderly women and women with children who used to not participate in labor also actively participated in collective production labor.

We had no experience in leading production, but we had one old trick, which was to do as Chairman Mao said. Chairman Mao taught us to serve the people completely and thoroughly, and to be extremely responsible for work, so we followed this teaching and endured hardships first in everything.

The community's enthusiasm was aroused, but another difficulty arose, which was that we few people were unfamiliar with farm work, and often made mistakes when assigning tasks. What to do? We turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. Chairman Mao said: "Learning war from war—this is our main method. Those who have no opportunity to go to school can still learn war, that is, learn from war. Revolutionary war is the people's business, often not learning first and then doing, but doing and then learning, doing is learning." We also learned from the army, learning from practice. We took old farmers as our teachers, learning to plow, herd sheep, and use the plow. Although we fell a few times and suffered some hardships, we finally learned it.

We few young women have decided to forever follow Chairman Mao's words and make a revolution for life.

### 学习“老三篇”，从“我”字中解放出来——绛县干部、社员在讲用会上谈学习心得

    学习“老三篇”，从“我”字中解放出来
    ——绛县干部、社员在讲用会上谈学习心得
    山西省绛县人民热烈响应林彪同志的号召，正在把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段。他们特别把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学。许多社员不但会背“老三篇”，而且把张思德、白求恩、老愚公当作镜子、尺子，天天照，天天量，自觉地进行思想改造，因此，人们的精神面貌大改变，新人新事大量涌现。
    下面是绛县的几个干部、社员在最近举行的一次“老三篇”讲用会上所讲的学习心得体会。
    “老三篇”帮助我走出了家庭小天地
    大交公社东贺水大队的董枝花说：我今年四十三岁，由于家里孩子多，我一天到晚被家务事纠缠住，忙得团团转。前几年，不用说参加集体生产劳动，连会也很少参加。去年，我同许多社员一块学习了“老三篇”，就觉得自己那一点也比不上张思德、白求恩和老愚公。毛主席说：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。”可是，我老是钻在自家屋里，坐在炕头，围着锅台，守着门口，这怎能为建设社会主义出力呢？我左思右想觉得不对头。我是贫农，要听毛主席的话，要为建设社会主义出力，要做一个有益于人民的人。
    可是，家里的活谁干呢？缝衣补袜、烧水做饭、推米磨面、养鸡喂猪、看孩子奶娃娃……就没个完。我又带着这些问题，再学“老三篇”。白求恩为了帮助中国革命，可以不远万里来到中国，我为啥不能走出家门呢？老愚公可以搬走两座大山，我为啥不能克服孩子多的困难呢？张思德为革命献出自己的生命，为啥我舍不得这个家呢？想着想着，我的勇气就大了。毛主席说：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我下决心照毛主席这个指示去做，鼓起勇气，走出家门。
    家里的困难怎么解决呢？我召开了家庭会议，讨论出两个办法：第一个办法是家务事大家一齐动手干。让大孩管小孩。做饭时，老汉烧火我和面，二孩担水。吃完饭，老二喂鸡，老三喂猪，各干各的活。第二个办法是家务活早计划早安排。有的活放到星期天孩子们放假时集中干，有的活放在晚上干。这样我就腾出手，参加了集体生产劳动。
    现在，我天天出勤，今年到九月底，我已做了二百三十多个劳动日，家务活也安排得很好，还天天坚持学毛主席著作了。读毛主席的书，我觉得自己思想进步了，浑身有使不完的力气。过去只能看到小家庭，想的是鼻子尖下的小事。现在想的看的是社会主义、阶级斗争、生产斗争和反对帝国主义、现代修正主义的大事情。
      我们靠毛泽东思想征服了艰险
    南樊公社槐泉大队的刘进学说：我出身贫农家庭，今年二十六岁。我仇恨旧社会，热爱毛主席。两年来，我通读了《毛泽东著作选读》乙种本，经常用
  “老三篇”来检查思想和行动，决心要为革命贡献自己的一切。
    一九六五年秋天，在里册峪修建“五一渠”的时候，我们民兵排的任务，是在我们的工段内，在高达百米以上的悬崖绝壁间，炸出一段八十米长的渠道。这是整个工地最艰险的一段工程，要用绳索把人吊在半空凿石打眼放炮。有的地段，在悬崖中间的凹处施工，人在半空够不着岩石，要用“空中飞人”的办法，荡来荡去，才够着岩石打眼放炮。有些人看到这种情况，有些胆怯。我就组织大家学习《愚公移山》，增添了无限的勇气和力量。我想，悬崖绝壁也是一只纸老虎，没有什么可怕的，只要我们按照毛主席的教导去做，就会取得胜利。于是，我要求第一个下去打眼放炮。
    有一次，我们装了四十八炮，根据放炮讯号，我把四十八炮全部点着，然后飞快跑开。跑了二十多米，忽然发现山下从拐弯处走出五个交公粮的社员，吆喝着牲口，进入了危险区。叫他们避开已经来不及了。我为他们急得浑身冒汗。这时候，毛主席好像在对我说：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”于是，我不顾一切地跑回去拔药捻。当时脑子里只有一个想法：赶快拔掉全部火药捻子！民兵靳吉贵同志也和我一起抢着拔。我们很快拔掉了全部火药捻子。当我把最后一根火药捻子连着雷管一起拔出来扔开的时候，雷管就在半空爆炸了。多危险啊，如果再迟一秒钟，就会出现一场严重的不幸事故。
    在炸石工程中，我们时时学习毛主席著作，坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，在数九寒天里，战胜了寒冷、大风、危险等各种困难，胜利地完成了开渠任务。
    我深深体会到：只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才是最聪明的人，最勇敢的人，是最大的战斗力。
        为革命喂好牲口
    南樊公社南柳大队的乔子明说：一九六四年秋天，队里选我当了饲养员。当时，正好饲养棚被水冲塌了，队里忙着种麦收秋，也顾不上盖，天气又渐渐冷了。我住在饲养处，挨了几天冻，思想便动摇了。我带着这个问题，学习了《纪念白求恩》。毛主席号召大家要学习白求恩毫不利己专门利人的精神。我想，如果我一事当前，先为自己打算，这怎能算听毛主席的话呢？我是个贫农，从小给地主当长工，挨冻受饿。共产党和毛主席来了，我才得到解放，过上了今天的幸福日子。可是，我的思想还没有从“私”字里解放出来，这不是忘了本吗？毛主席说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。”革命工作摆在面前，咱贫农不干谁干？想到这些，我就坚决干下去，而且要干好。
    我访问了模范饲养员王歧山，学习他的好经验，精心喂养牲口，眼看着牲口一天天长膘，心里很高兴。
    我除了喂好自己的牲口，还帮助另一个饲养员担水、垫圈、割苜蓿。他感谢我。我说：“我也不是给你一个人干活，咱都是为革命，谁也别谢谁，都要感谢毛主席！要不是读了毛主席的书，你就是给我工分，我也不会帮你干呢！”
    为了养好牲口，我和其他饲养员一起，研究出一种办法，给牲口医治脱肛病。有时候，兄弟队请我给牲口医病，我腰痛病犯了，也坚持去。有时候，跑到六十多里地以外去帮助外县的兄弟队给牲口治病。有人为这表扬我。其实，人家白求恩不远万里来到中国，为了中国革命献出了他宝贵的生命。我才走了这点路，做了这点事，比起白求恩，差得远哩！以后我一举一动都要照毛主席的话做，为革命贡献出更大的力量。
      听毛主席的话，敢于挑重担子
    城关公社峪南大队的李素英说：今年秋收的时候，我们第三生产队的社员们，根据我和王素云、桑素芳、司素萍、高素菊的日常表现，选我们五个女青年当了政治工作员、生产队长、副队长和妇女队长。我们几个女娃跑到一块商量。有的说，咱第三生产队土地瘠薄，生产落后。咱们平均年龄还不到十七岁，人小经验少，干不好。我说，咱队男劳动力很少，咱都是贫农的女儿，集体生产咱不管让谁管？咱要照毛主席说的去做。经过一番讨论，大家一致认为，既然学了“老三篇”，就要像张思德那样完全、彻底为人民服务。这个重担子咱们挑了。大队党支部书记和贫下中农都来鼓励我们，支持我们。有了党的领导和贫下中农的支持，我们的信心更大了。
    担子是挑起来了，但如何挑好呢？选上我们的时候，正是秋收、秋种、秋耕最紧张的时候，农活像山一样堆了一堆，可是劳动力少，忙不过来。怎么办？这时候，我们想起了毛主席的教导：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”我们几个决定首先组织社员学
  “老三篇”，通过学习，提高觉悟，开展思想革命化。结果，群众精神面貌发生很大的变化，大家纷纷表示要学老愚公的精神，决心克服困难，改变生产队的落后面貌。社员们自动提早了上工时间，一些过去不参加劳动的老年妇女和有孩子的妇女，也积极参加了集体生产劳动。
    我们领导生产没有经验，可是我们有一条老主意，就是毛主席怎么说我们就怎么办。毛主席教导我们要完全、彻底地为人民服务，对工作要极端的负责任，我们就本着这个教导，事事吃苦在前。
    群众积极性调动起来了，又有一个困难摆在面前，就是我们几个人农活生疏，派活经常发生差错。怎么办？又向毛主席著作请教。毛主席说：“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。没有进学校机会的人，仍然可以学习战争，就是从战争中学习。革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”我们也像解放军那样，从干中学。我们拜老农为师，学习犁地、放羊、扶耧，尽管跌了跟斗，吃了一些苦头，最后我们还是学会了。
    我们几个女青年已经下定决心，永远听毛主席的话，闹一辈子革命。
