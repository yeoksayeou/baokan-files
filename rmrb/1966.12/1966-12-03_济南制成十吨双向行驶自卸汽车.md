Implementing the Policy of Combining Revolution with Production

Jinan Produces 10-Ton Bidirectional Self-Dumping Truck

This type of truck, with its unique shape, structure, and layout, is different from ordinary trucks. It is suitable for use in tunnels, mountainous areas, plateaus, and railway construction sites, making it a product urgently needed for China's socialist construction.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on the 2nd, the workers of the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Factory have been holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have dared to challenge difficulties and overcome fears. In just 100 days, they have designed and tested China's first 10-ton bidirectional self-dumping truck. This major achievement in China's automobile manufacturing industry is a great victory for the Party's policy of self-reliance, a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and ultimately, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The 10-ton bidirectional self-dumping truck is a product urgently needed for China's socialist construction. It is suitable for use in tunnels, mountainous areas, plateaus, and railway construction sites. The shape, overall layout, and structure of this type of truck are different from ordinary trucks and have been imported from abroad in the past.

The process of designing and testing the 10-ton bidirectional self-dumping truck has been a process of the workers of the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Factory studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. It has been a process of using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls and promote ideological revolutionization; it has been a process of implementing the Sixteen Points, combining revolution with production.

In June of this year, the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Factory accepted the task of designing and testing this new product. The factory immediately organized two teams, taking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the guiding principle, mobilizing the masses broadly and deeply, relying on the masses, and combining revolution with production. The workers first started by studying the "Three Articles" to overcome fears and establish courage. The workers regarded the completion of this testing task as a specific action to implement Chairman Mao's great strategic plan of preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people. It is a contribution to the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan, to the victory of the Cultural Revolution, and to the support of the world revolution. They said: The task is on the agenda, and with the "enemy situation" in mind, the direction is clear, and the enthusiasm is high. However, some technicians were skeptical about testing this new product. They said that they had never seen a bidirectional self-dumping truck, and while imitation was possible, self-design was difficult. Some even thought that the factory had a majority of young workers, with the average age of the design team being only 29, and that it was impossible to design and test a new car in three months! In response to these active thoughts and specific problems in the design and testing process, the workers repeatedly studied the "Three Articles" and "On the Reunification of China" and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" Their confidence soared, and their enthusiasm grew. They said: Even if experience, time, and conditions are insufficient, as long as Mao Zedong Thought is in command, everything will be sufficient! With heightened ideological awareness, creativity emerged. The designers, with Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people and learning from workers and peasants, went to the workshops and conducted on-site designs with the workers. Many difficult problems were solved.

During the testing process of the 10-ton bidirectional self-dumping truck, the factory received support and help from many units across the country.

Recently, the workers of this factory have been cooperating with the using departments to conduct comprehensive tests, improvements, and evaluations of the sample car, while also preparing for production, so as to provide more 10-ton bidirectional self-dumping trucks to the state next year.

    贯彻执行抓革命促生产的方针
    济南制成十吨双向行驶自卸汽车
    这种汽车的外形、结构，和一般汽车不同，适用于隧洞、山区、高原和铁路建设等工地，是我国社会主义建设急需的产品
    据新华社济南二日电济南汽车制造总厂广大职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命中，大立“敢”字，大破“怕”字，仅仅用了一百天时间，就设计、试制出我国第一辆十吨双向行驶自卸汽车。我国汽车制造工业的这项重大成就，是党的自力更生方针的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，归根结底，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    十吨双向行驶自卸汽车，是我国社会主义建设急需的产品。它适用于隧洞、山区、高原和铁路建设等工地。这一种汽车的外形、总布置以及结构，都和一般汽车有所不同，过去一直是从国外进口。
    十吨双向行驶自卸汽车设计和试制的过程，是济南汽车制造总厂广大职工活学活用毛主席著作的过程，是这个厂广大职工用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，促进思想革命化的过程；是贯彻十六条，抓革命，促生产的过程。
    今年六月份，济南汽车制造总厂接受了设计、试制这项新产品的任务。厂里立刻组织了两套班子，以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，广泛深入发动群众，依靠群众，一手抓革命，一手抓生产。广大职工首先从学习“老三篇”入手，打掉“怕”字，树立“敢”字。广大职工把实现这项试制任务，看做是贯彻执行毛主席提出的备战、备荒、为人民的伟大战略方针的具体行动，是为实现第三个五年计划，为取得文化大革命的胜利，为支援世界革命做出贡献。他们说：任务上了纲，带着“敌情”上阵，干起活来方向明，干劲足。但是，有的技术人员对试制这项新产品抱怀疑态度。他们说，双向行驶自卸汽车没有见过，仿造还可以，自己设计困难。还有人认为：厂里青工占多数，搞设计的队伍平均年龄只有二十九岁，三个月设计试制出新车不可能！针对这些活思想，针对设计、试制工作中的具体问题，职工们反复学习了“老三篇”和《关于重庆谈判》、《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》，大家信心倍增，干劲大长。他们说：经验不够，时间不够，条件不够，只要有毛泽东思想挂帅，什么都够了！思想觉悟提高了，创造性就有了。设计人员带着毛主席教导的为人民服务、向工农学习的决心下车间，和工人一道大搞现场设计，一些困难问题迎刃而解。
    十吨双向行驶自卸汽车在试制过程中，得到了全国许多单位的支援和帮助。
    最近，这个厂的职工一面和使用部门配合，对样车进行全面试验、改进、鉴定，一面进行生产准备，以便明年向国家提供更多十吨双向行驶自卸汽车。
