The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a report meeting today to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the Vietnam People's Army.

Colonel Chen Wenpeng, military attaché of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's embassy in China, and Nguyen Thuan Hoa, secretary of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's permanent representative office in China, were invited to give reports at the meeting. Their reports were warmly welcomed by the more than 800 Chinese People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers present.

The meeting was presided over by Fu Zhong, deputy director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, expressed the highest respect to the brothers and sisters of the Vietnam People's Army who are fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle, and extended warm congratulations on the sixth anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front.

Colonel Chen Wenpeng, in his report, detailed the glorious combat history of the Vietnam People's Army and its heroic deeds in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

Chen Wenpeng said, "We firmly believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the seven hundred million heroic Chinese people will surely overfulfill the Third Five-Year Plan, and will achieve greater victories in class struggle, production struggle, scientific experiments, national defense consolidation, and the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Nguyen Thuan Hoa, in his report, introduced the great victories and ever-increasing achievements of the Vietnamese people and military in the south in their struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys.

Deputy Director Fu Zhong then gave a speech of thanks. He said, "The peoples and armies of China and Vietnam are the closest comrades-in-arms. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are determined to be a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people. We will not hesitate to make any national sacrifices and are determined to fight alongside the Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat American imperialism until final victory is achieved."

Attending the report meeting today were various leaders from the Chinese People's Liberation Army's general departments, military branches, and services, including Pan Zhenwu, Song Chengzhi, Luo Huasheng, Zhang Kuiyi, Qi Xianchu, Chen Yigui, Zhu Min, Li Dazong, Feng Weijing, and Wang Li.

After the meeting, a Vietnamese documentary film titled "Returning to the Embrace of the North" was screened.
