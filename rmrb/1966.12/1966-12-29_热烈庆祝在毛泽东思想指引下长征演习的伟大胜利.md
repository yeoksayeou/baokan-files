Thousands of Long March teams from all over the country, comprising over 100,000 revolutionary youths, gathered in Beijing to hold an experience-sharing conference. They enthusiastically celebrated the great victory of the Long March exercise under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Zhou Enlai, on behalf of Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, extended greetings to all the revolutionary youths of the Long March teams.

Comrade Jiang Qing said: The revolutionary road is tortuous and uneven. Comrades, you must continue to advance with courage and a hundredfold revolutionary spirit.

In a letter to Chairman Mao, the Long March youths expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's books, follow Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They vowed to firmly carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, becoming reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

New China News Agency, December 28th: Over 100,000 Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country, who had marched on foot to Beijing for revolutionary linkage, gathered today at the Workers' Stadium in the capital to hold the "National Long March Teams Experience-Sharing Conference." They celebrated the great victory of the Long March exercise under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Central and other leaders Comrade Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Yang Chengwu, Jiang Qing, Peng Shaohui, Liu Zhijian, Zhang Chunqiao, and Wu De attended the conference.

Today, thousands of Long March team flags fluttered in the bright sunlight, turning the vast Workers' Stadium into a sea of red. The Red Guard youths were all in high spirits, repeatedly reading Chairman Mao's quotations and singing songs composed from Chairman Mao's quotations. Their voices and songs echoed throughout the stadium.

At 12:30 PM, Comrade Zhou Enlai and other central and other leaders arrived at the venue. They joined the assembled Red Guard youths and revolutionary students in singing "The East Is Red." They then boarded open-top cars and slowly circled the stadium track, greeting all the Long March youths. At this moment, the entire stadium was in a state of joyous excitement. The youths repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Cultural Revolution!" "Defend to the death the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!" Comrade Zhou Enlai and others waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao," joining the Red Guards and revolutionary students in shouting, "Our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao lives forever! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The thousands of Long March teams participating in today's experience-sharing conference came from all over the country. These revolutionary youths, inspired by Chairman Mao's support for on-foot linkage, inherited the revolutionary traditions of the old Red Army, overcame all difficulties, and traversed mountains and rivers to reach Beijing, the center of the Cultural Revolution, and to be by the side of our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao. Today, holding this conference, the youths were extremely excited and overjoyed.

After the conference began, the representative of the presidium delivered the opening speech. He said, "Our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and are tempered in the great winds and waves of the revolution.' Our Long March has been carried out according to this great instruction of Chairman Mao. Our Long March has finally been victorious. Our victory is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought! But the Long March of ten thousand miles, we have only completed the first step. We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, be humble, cautious, guard against arrogance and impatience, maintain the spirit of hard struggle, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for new victories in the Cultural Revolution."

Comrade Jiang Qing, the first deputy director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, spoke amidst thunderous applause. She said passionately, "Comrades, Red Guard youths, you have marched on foot from all over the country to Beijing. We welcome you! We salute you in the name of the Cultural Revolution."

She said: You have come here following Chairman Mao's teachings, carrying forward the spirit of hard work and simplicity. You have learned from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. You have inherited and carried forward excellent revolutionary traditions. We learn from you. The revolutionary road is tortuous and uneven. Comrades, you must continue to advance with courage and a hundredfold revolutionary spirit.

A representative from the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards Long March team from Wuxi Light Industry Institute shared their experiences and insights from their 39-day march from Wuxi to Beijing. Finally, he said excitedly: The Long March is a great school, a great furnace. In 39 days, we have attended a vivid class on class education in this great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Through extensive contact with society and learning from workers and peasants, our minds have become much wiser and cleaner. We have further understood Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." The great winds and waves of mass struggle have taught us: We must believe in the masses, we must believe in the Party. Our red hearts will forever be with our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao! We will forever follow Chairman Mao through the great winds and waves, vowing to carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end!

Then, Comrade Zhou Enlai, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, spoke amidst enthusiastic cheers. Comrade Zhou Enlai first, on behalf of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as the Party Central Committee and the State Council, extended greetings to all the Red Guard youths and revolutionary students of the Long March teams. He said, "You have come from all over our country, through mountains and rivers, finally to our capital Beijing. We welcome you!"

He said, "We are very happy that you have learned from the spirit of the PLA. Some of you have walked one or two thousand miles, some three or four thousand miles, and the farthest have walked over five thousand miles to Beijing. This spirit is worth learning from, worth all students in the country learning from. You said it correctly, this is only the first step of the Long March of ten thousand miles. You still need to continue to learn from the PLA, to be propaganda teams, work teams, and study teams, and to keep the revolutionary spirit of on-foot linkage forever."

After Comrade Zhou Enlai finished his speech, he led everyone in shouting: "Long live the Long March spirit!" "Long live the Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" At this moment, the entire stadium was stirred, and there was prolonged, enthusiastic applause.

The conference finally passed a letter to Chairman Mao. The youths expressed in the letter their determination to read Chairman Mao's books, follow Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They vowed to firmly carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, making continuous revolution, forever revolution, and becoming reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    今天，数千面迎风招展的长征队旗，在灿烂的阳光照耀下，把宽广的工人体育场映得一片通红。红卫兵小将们个个喜气洋洋，一遍又一遍地朗读毛主席语录，高唱用毛主席语录谱写的歌曲，朗读声和歌声响彻全场。

    大会开始后，主席团代表首先致开幕词。他说，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”我们的长征正是按照毛主席的这一伟大指示去做的。我们长征终于胜利了。我们的胜利是毛泽东思想的胜利！但是，万里长征我们还只是走完了第一步。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，继续保持艰苦奋斗的作风，不怕牺牲，排除万难，奋勇前进，去争取无产阶级文化大革命的新的胜利。

    接着，中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理周恩来同志在全场热烈的欢呼声中讲话。周恩来同志首先代表伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志以及党中央和国务院，向全体长征队红卫兵小将和革命师生问好。他说，你们从我们祖国的四面八方，通过千山万水，终于来到我们首都北京，我们欢迎你们！
    他说，我们很高兴，你们学习解放军的精神，有的走了一二千里路，有的走了三四千里路，最远的走了五千多里路来到北京。你们这种精神值得我们学习，值得全国的同学学习。你们自己说得很对，这仅仅是万里长征的第一步。你们还要继续向解放军学习，作宣传队、工作队和学习队，将徒步串连的革命精神永远保持下去。
    周恩来同志在结束讲话以后，领着大家高呼：“长征精神万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“无产阶级专政万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“我们伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”这时，全场振奋，长时间地热烈鼓掌。
