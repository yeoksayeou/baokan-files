Listen to Chairman Mao's Words, Actively Participate in Socialist Revolution and Construction

The second batch of Indonesian victims who returned to the country aboard the Guanghua ship left Zhanjiang today, full of joy and excitement, heading to Ninghua County, Fujian Province, to participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The atmosphere at Zhanjiang Railway Station was filled with revolutionary fervor. In recent days, the Red Guards and revolutionary students who had formed close friendships with the returning compatriots held up red banners reading "Warmly send off the returning compatriots to the frontlines of socialist revolution and socialist construction" and waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," rushing to see off the compatriots. They sang "Strive for Victory," a song based on Chairman Mao's quotations, over and over again, wishing the compatriots success in their new posts, diligently studying Chairman Mao's works, and promoting ideological revolutionization. The compatriots, each with a spirit of vigor, held up portraits of Chairman Mao and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting in excitement:

"Long live Chairman Mao!"
"Long live the motherland!"

The 41 young Indonesian compatriots who are still in Zhanjiang also came to the station to enthusiastically see them off.

Many compatriots, before heading to Ninghua, recited Chairman Mao's poem from the Second Revolutionary Civil War period over and over again with excitement: "Ninghua, Qingliu, Guihua, the path is narrow, the forest deep, and the moss slippery. Today, where are we heading? Straight to the foot of Wuyi Mountain. Under the mountain, under the mountain, the red flag flutters like a painting." They also expressed their determination over and over again: We must read Chairman Mao's books well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Together with the local people, we will turn this place, rich in revolutionary history, into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Mingming, December 12th: The second batch of Indonesian victims who returned to the country aboard the Guanghua ship arrived in Sanming Prefecture, Fujian Province, by special train from Zhanjiang, Guangdong. They will settle in the state-owned Quanshang Overseas Chinese Farm in Ninghua County of this prefecture and participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland.

When the compatriots' special train arrived in Sanming City, it was warmly welcomed and enthusiastically received by more than 20,000 revolutionary masses and party and government leaders.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Ninghua, December 10th: The state-owned Quanshang Overseas Chinese Farm in Ninghua County, Fujian Province, has made all preparations to welcome the second batch of Indonesian compatriots returning to the country. Now, everywhere is filled with a revolutionary atmosphere. Red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" signs stand along both sides of the roads leading to various management areas of the farm and around rows of brand-new buildings. In every room prepared to receive the new returning compatriots, a portrait of Chairman Mao and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" are hung on the pristine white walls. Inside the rooms, "Chairman Mao's Three Articles" are placed on the tables. A set of newly made daily necessities has also been arranged in each new room.

Quanshang is located in a basin in the northeastern part of Ninghua County, a revolutionary base area. It has abundant rainfall, suitable for planting grain crops and economic crops such as tea and fruit trees. Overseas Chinese who came from various overseas Chinese farms across Fujian Province to participate in the development work of Quanshang Farm expressed their determination to work together with the new compatriots to paint a new and beautiful picture in this place where revolutionary martyrs once fought.

    听毛主席的话，积极参加社会主义革命和建设
    第二批印尼归侨精神焕发奔赴宁化
    新华社湛江十日电第二批乘光华轮胜利回国的印尼受害华侨今天离开湛江，兴高采烈地前往福建省宁化县参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    湛江火车站洋溢着欢腾的革命气氛。连日来和归国难侨们结下了亲密友谊的红卫兵和革命师生们，高举着“热烈欢送归国侨胞走上社会主义革命和社会主义建设岗位”的红色横幅，挥舞着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，赶到这里来给难侨们送行。他们一遍又一遍地唱着毛主席语录歌《争取胜利》，祝愿难侨们到达工作岗位以后，努力学习毛主席著作，促进思想革命化。难侨们个个精神焕发，高举着毛主席像和《毛主席语录》，一再激动地高呼：
  “毛主席万岁！”“祖国万岁！”
    目前还留在湛江的四十一名华侨青少年等，也到车站热情欢送。
    许多难侨在去宁化之前，一遍又一遍激动地朗诵毛主席在第二次国内革命战争时期写下的诗篇：“宁化、清流、归化，路隘林深苔滑。今日向何方，直指武夷山下。山下山下，风展红旗如画。”他们还一次又一次地表示决心：我们一定要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，同当地人民一起，把这个富有革命历史意义的地方，建设成为毛泽东思想的大学校。
    据新华社三明十二日电  第二批乘光华轮回国的印尼受害华侨，今天乘专车由广东湛江到达福建省三明专区。他们将在这个专区宁化县的国营泉上华侨农场安家落户，参加祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    当难侨专车到达三明市时，受到当地党政负责同志和二万多革命群众的热烈欢迎和盛情接待。
    据新华社宁化十日电福建省宁化县国营泉上华侨农场，已经为迎接第二批回国印尼华侨作好准备。现在，这里处处洋溢着一派革命景象。红色的毛主席语录牌，林立在通往农场各管理区的大道两旁和一排排崭新的建筑物周围。每一间准备接待新来归国华侨的住房的雪白墙壁上，都挂上了毛主席像和毛主席语录。在住房里的桌子上，还放着毛主席的“老三篇”。一套套新制的日常生活必备家具，也已分别安置在各间新房里。
    泉上位于宁化县东北部一块盆地上，是革命老根据地。这里雨量充足，适宜种植粮食作物和茶树、果树等经济作物。从福建全省各个华侨农场前来参加泉上农场开辟工作的归国华侨们，纷纷表示要同新来的侨胞们一起，在这块革命先烈战斗过的地方绘出一幅又新又美的图画。
