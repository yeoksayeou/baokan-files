The "Three Articles" shine in our hearts, with boundless power to fight against heaven and earth. The "Three Articles" are all red.

The "Three Articles" are red, every word and sentence shines brightly. Held high, they radiate golden light; kept close, they warm the heart. The "Three Articles" are red, read them every day and use them every day. "Completely" and "thoroughly" for the people, forever be a rustless screw.

The "Three Articles" are red, they teach us to break down selfishness and establish the public good. Throw away the "I" to the heavens, devote your heart to the Party and revolution. The "Three Articles" are red, revolutionize the soul, kick away obstacles, and fight against heaven and earth like Yu Gong.

The "Three Articles" are red, inherit the revolutionary tradition. Die for the revolutionary cause, live for the Party's mission. The "Three Articles" are red, strive for life and use them for life. The more achievements, the more we learn; the more urgent the tasks, the more we grasp tightly.

The "Three Articles" are red, each one is our guiding principle. Move forward with direction, forever red-hearted towards Mao Zedong.
