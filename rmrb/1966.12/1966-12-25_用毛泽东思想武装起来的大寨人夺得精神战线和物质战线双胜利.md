The people of Dazhai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved victory on both the ideological and material fronts this year by overcoming five major disasters. Through their struggle against these disasters, the people of Dazhai have become even stronger, and Dazhai has been built even better.

Editor's Note: Comrade Lin Biao said in the preface to the reprint of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong": "Now, in our great motherland, a new era is emerging where workers, peasants, and soldiers are mastering Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force, a spiritual atomic bomb of tremendous power." The brilliant deeds of the people of Dazhai in overcoming five major natural disasters this year, such as drought, heavy rain, and pestilence, and achieving victory on both the ideological and material fronts, powerfully prove the absolute correctness of this statement.

The people of Dazhai say well: "This power is great, that power is great, but nothing compares to the power of Mao Zedong Thought; this victory, that victory, all are victories of Mao Zedong Thought." The people of Dazhai have become towering figures because of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The people of Dazhai are fearless in the face of severe natural disasters, dare to struggle, and are good at struggling, all because of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The people of Dazhai firmly believe that the great Mao Zedong Thought will inspire them to overcome all difficulties and achieve victory. Whenever natural disasters strike, they bring their problems to the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Each time they study Chairman Mao's works, they gain more strength and wisdom. The greater the disaster, the greater their enthusiasm; the more disasters, the more solutions they find. Spiritual power has been transformed into tremendous material power.

The people of Dazhai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are always full of vigor and fighting spirit. Post-disaster Dazhai is even better built. The people of Dazhai have become even stronger through their struggle against difficulties. The movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the masses in Dazhai Brigade has become even more widespread and in-depth. Let us, like the people of Dazhai, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, broaden our horizons to see the future, and advance steadfastly!

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 24th: This year, the heroic people of Dazhai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, under the impetus of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have consecutively overcome five major disasters and achieved triple harvests in ideology, production, and farmland construction. This brilliant new achievement once again demonstrates the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought.

This year, Dazhai Brigade has been under the threat of severe natural disasters from spring planting to autumn harvest. The drought that began last year continued into this summer. In July, heavy rain and mountain floods destroyed the neat fields of Dazhai in seven major gullies, leaving them in disarray. Subsequently, there were floods, pestilence, and windstorms. The scale of the disasters was unprecedented in Dazhai's history. However, the people of Dazhai, following Chairman Mao's teachings, overcame all difficulties for the revolution, relying on collective efforts to fight against nature and persevere through hardships, ultimately achieving a great victory in disaster resistance and bumper harvest, making the collective economy even more prosperous. Red Guards who traveled thousands of miles to learn from Dazhai, standing on Tiger Head Mountain, saw that the lands destroyed by the floods had been repaired anew. The stone dams were neat and sturdy. In the terraced fields of the most severely affected Wolf's Paw Gorge, green wheat was growing, and the threshing floor was piled high with corn. They could not help but feel deeply moved and excited.

This spring, as the drought threat became increasingly severe, some people worried that production would be difficult under such severe drought conditions, and serious reduction in yield was inevitable. The difficulties were indeed great. However, the people of Dazhai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, saw the difficulties but were not afraid of them. They said proudly: With the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, even if the sky were to fall, we would hold it up. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in this year's anti-disaster struggle and build Dazhai even better!

To complete the arduous task of fighting the drought, the Dazhai Party branch first focused on the human factor and the revolutionization of people's thinking. The branch organized all the cadres and villagers to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" extensively, using Mao Zedong Thought to summarize past anti-disaster experiences. Mao Zedong Thought gave the people of Dazhai boundless wisdom and strength. They boosted their revolutionary spirit and vowed to compete with the heavens. In the spring, they built six high-standard gully-dam projects in places like Wolf's Paw, Xiaobei Valley, and Zhao Bei Valley. They also dug six wells on the mountain to store water and adopted the method of step-by-step water transfer to bring water from the foothills to the mountains for storage. They also built canals to bring water from the Guozhuang Reservoir ten miles away. By the end of April, they launched a campaign to repair the fields. All the cadres and villagers organized themselves to repair the fields day and night, working for forty consecutive days and repairing a total of 230 mu. By the end of May, it was still dry. The villagers said: It doesn't matter if it doesn't rain, Mao Zedong Thought is the rain. Thus, the villagers organized themselves again, and in the fields where they could borrow moisture to sow, they dug through the dry soil layer and sowed on the wet soil; for the fields that could not be sown, they carried water to sow. The young and strong carried water, the elderly watered, the children carried water, and the women sowed and spread fertilizer. In this way, all the villagers and cadres fought continuously for more than fifty days, carrying over 60,000 loads of water, and finally completed the sowing task.

The seedlings came up. But the severe drought continued. After the seedlings emerged, many died. Thus, the villagers watered and replanted. Because the drought-affected area was large, after watering one field, another field would dry up, and there were still dead seedlings. At this time, the people of Dazhai, inspired by Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to overcome all difficulties, fearing no sacrifice, and striving for victory," displayed their revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and being good at struggling. They creatively adopted the method of manually transplanting seedlings and finally filled in the missing seedlings.

Just as they had overcome the vicious drought, they were hit by a severe flood. Two mountain floods and heavy rains washed away 178 gullies and dams in Dazhai, destroying 170 mu of the best soil quality gully-dam fields. The places most cared about by the people, Wolf's Paw and Cooperation Gully, were washed away to reveal the stone riverbed. The damage caused by the two disasters was much more severe than the major mountain flood in 1963.

After the disaster, the Party branch held consecutive branch meetings, cadre meetings, and villagers' meetings, organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's works with their problems. They reviewed the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions: "Our comrades must see achievements and see light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." The great leader's teachings gave them boundless strength and wisdom. After everyone discussed and came up with ideas together, they finally worked out the remedial measures of "rushing to the ridges after gully fields are damaged, one stalk of grain tops half, strengthening management with sufficient fertilizer, and no reduction in yield despite major floods and droughts," determined to seize a bumper harvest from the "mud dragon's mouth" to support national construction and world revolution.

Another fierce anti-disaster struggle began. The villagers rushed to the mountains to repair the stone dams, drain water, and support seedlings. They transplanted and replanted. Chen Yonggui and other cadres studied and fought alongside everyone. The chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association, the 58-year-old old hero Jia Jincai, led the stone-breaking group of villagers to work day and night in the stone pits of Jinshi Slope. Guo Fenglian, Jia Xiulan, and other iron girls stood in deep muddy water for days to support seedlings. Brigade leader Jia Chengran and the chairwoman of the Women's Representative Assembly, Song Liying, led the villagers to deliver and chase fertilizer. The villagers repairing the dams had even greater determination. They said, "We will not only repair the dams destroyed by the floods but also make them more solid than before." The repaired dams of Wolf's Paw and Zhao Bei Valley were all built with large stone blocks, and lime was used to fill the gaps.

Soon after the drought and floods, it rained continuously for more than twenty days, seriously affecting the pollination of corn and the growth of other crops. By late August, nearly 200 mu of sorghum was infested with autumn stick insects. The villagers, like fighting against drought and floods, immediately launched a struggle against the pests without hesitation. After overcoming drought, floods, waterlogging, and pests, the sorghum was about to mature, and the corn began to fill, a strong northwest wind blew, killing some green corn and knocking off many sorghum grains. The people of Dazhai, who became stronger with each battle, remained undaunted and continued to fight against the disasters, finally overcoming the disasters and achieving a rare bumper harvest.

Facing five major disasters, it was a great misfortune, but the people of Dazhai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, turned the great misfortune into a great fortune. Post-disaster Dazhai was built even better than before. To strive for an even greater harvest next year, the winter wheat sowing area this year was expanded by more than three times compared to last year. The repaired gullies and dams were more solid and magnificent. For the first time, deep wells appeared on Tiger Head Mountain. The village built a batch of new green stone caves and houses and leveled a mountain top more than two zhang high into a large courtyard. The people of Dazhai are also preparing to build a group of dry wells and water channels to further improve the level of water conservancy.

This year, the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the masses in Dazhai was more widespread, in-depth, and solid than ever before. From children who have just learned to understand to elderly people in their seventies and eighties, almost everyone studies and applies. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they thoroughly criticize the "self" and establish the "public," fostering the idea of farming for the revolution. Visitors to Dazhai asked Chen Yonggui: Why are the villagers of Dazhai so capable? Chen Yonggui replied: "Because we have studied Chairman Mao's books." It was because the villagers of Dazhai read Chairman Mao's books and mastered Mao Zedong Thought that they overcame the unprecedented disasters this year and achieved triple harvests in ideology, production, and farmland construction. As the villagers said: This power is great, that power is great, but nothing compares to the power of Mao Zedong Thought; this victory, that victory, all are victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

They are determined to arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and become thorough revolutionaries of the proletariat.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨人夺得精神战线和物质战线双胜利
    大寨大队今年战胜五次大灾，人们在抗灾斗争中锻炼得更坚强了，大寨建设得更好了
    编者按：林彪同志在《毛主席语录》再版前言中说：“现在我们伟大的祖国，正在出现一个工农兵掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的新时代。毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”大寨人今年连续战胜干旱、暴雨、虫灾等五次严重自然灾害，在精神战线和物质战线取得双胜利的光辉事迹，有力地证明了这个论断的无比正确。
    大寨人说得好：“这威力大，那威力大，比不上毛泽东思想威力大；这一胜利，那一胜利，全都是毛泽东思想的胜利。”大寨人所以成为顶天立地的人，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。大寨人在严重的自然灾害面前所以无所畏惧，敢于斗争，善于斗争，同样靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    大寨人坚信伟大的毛泽东思想一定能够鼓舞他们排除万难，争取胜利。每当自然灾害袭来，他们就带着问题活学活用毛主席著作。每学一次毛主席著作，他们就鼓起了更大的力量，增添了更多的智慧。灾害越大，他们的干劲越大；灾害越多，他们的办法越多。精神力量变成了巨大的物质力量。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨人，永远朝气蓬勃，斗志昂扬。灾后的大寨建设得更好了。大寨人在同困难作斗争中锻炼得更坚强了。大寨大队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动开展得更广泛、更深入了。让我们像大寨人那样，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，放开眼界看未来，坚定不移向前进！
    据新华社太原二十四日电　今年，用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄大寨人，在进一步活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推动下，连续战胜五次大灾，夺得了思想、生产和农田建设的三丰收。这一光辉的新成就再一次显示了毛泽东思想的无限威力。
    今年，大寨大队从春种到秋收，一直处在严重自然灾害的威胁之中。从去年即开始的大旱，一直延续到今夏。七月间的暴雨、山洪，把七条大沟里整齐的大寨田，冲得七零八落。接着，又接连发生涝灾、虫灾和风灾。灾害之大，在大寨历史上是空前的。然而，大寨人按照毛主席的教导，为革命排除万难，靠集体战天斗地，艰苦奋斗，终于取得抗灾丰收的伟大胜利，使集体经济办得更加兴旺。不远千里前来学习的红卫兵们，站在虎头山上，看到被洪水冲毁的土地早已重新整修一新，一条条大青石坝显得那样整齐而又坚固，受灾最重的狼窝掌沟的梯田里，长着绿油油的小麦，场上玉米堆积如山，无不感到万分激动和兴奋。
    今年春天，当干旱威胁越来越严重的时候，曾有人担心在这样大旱的情况下，生产很难进行，严重减产在所难免。困难确实是很大的。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨人，既看到困难，又不怕困难。他们豪迈地说：有毛主席和党中央的领导，就是天塌下来，我们也要顶住。我们一定要在今年的抗灾斗争中，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗举得更高，把大寨建设得更好！
    为了完成抗旱的艰巨任务，大寨党支部首先抓人的因素，抓人的思想革命化。支部组织全队干部和社员大学“老三篇”，用毛泽东思想总结过去的抗灾经验。毛泽东思想为大寨人增添了无穷的智慧和力量。他们大振革命精神，誓同老天比高低。春天，他们在狼窝掌、小背峪、赵背峪等地，兴建了六处高标准沟坝工程。又在山上打了六眼蓄水的旱井，采取逐级转运的方法，把山下的水运到山上蓄存起来。他们还修筑渠道，从十里外的郭庄水库引来了水。到了四月底，他们又开展了修整地的斗争。全队干部和社员组织起来，白天修地，晚上也修地，连续修了四十天，一共修了二百三十亩。到了五月底，还是滴雨不下。社员们说：天不下雨不要紧，毛泽东思想就是雨。于是，社员们又组织起来，在能借墒播种的地块，扒开干土层，在湿土上播种；对实在不能播的地块，就挑水点种。青壮年挑水，老年人浇水，小孩端水，妇女点种、撒粪。就这样，全队社员和干部连续奋战了五十多天，挑水六万多担，终于胜利完成了播种任务。
    苗儿长出来了。但严重干旱还在继续。小苗出土后，又旱死了不少。于是，社员们又浇水补种。因为受旱面积大，浇了这块地，那块地又干了，还是有死苗现象。这时，大寨人在毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导的鼓舞下，发扬敢于斗争和善于斗争的革命精神，创造性地采取了手拔移苗的办法，终于把缺的苗补齐了。
    刚刚战胜了凶恶的旱魔，又遭到了特大的洪灾。两次山洪、暴雨，冲垮了大寨的一百七十八条沟坝，毁坏了土质最好的沟坝地一百七十亩，人们最关心的狼窝掌和合作沟，冲得露出了石底河道。两场灾害所造成的损失，比一九六三年那次大山洪还严重得多。
    党支部在灾后，连续召开了支部会、干部会、社员会，组织大家带着问题学习毛主席著作。他们重温伟大领袖毛主席的指示：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”伟大领袖的教导，给他们增添了无穷的力量和智慧。经过大家共同想办法、出主意，终于研究出了“沟地受灾梁上赶，一株禾苗顶株半，加强管理上足肥，大洪大旱不减产”的补救措施，决心从“泥龙口”夺取丰收，来支援国家建设和世界革命。
    又一场轰轰烈烈的抗灾斗争开始了。社员们上山抢修石坝，排水扶苗，移栽补种。陈永贵和其他干部，同大家一道学习，一道战斗。贫协主席、五十八岁的老英雄贾进才，带领着打石头组的社员们，日夜奋战在金石坡的石窝里。郭凤莲、贾秀兰等铁姑娘们，一连几天站在深深的泥水里扶苗。大队长贾承让和妇女代表会主任宋立英，领着社员送肥追肥。修坝的社员们决心更大，他们说，我们不但要把洪水冲坏的坝修起来，还要把它修得比原来更坚实。修复的狼窝掌、赵背峪沟的地坝，全部用大石块垒，还用石灰勾缝。
    旱灾、洪水刚过不久，又一连阴雨二十多天，严重地影响玉米扬花授粉和其他作物的生长。到八月下旬，又有近二百亩谷子发生秋粘虫。社员们和抗旱战洪一样，毫不犹豫地向害虫展开了斗争。闯过了旱、洪、涝、虫四害，谷子即将成熟，玉米也开始壮粒时，刮了一场西北大风，把一些青绿的玉米吹死了。谷粒也磨掉不少。越战越强的大寨人，毫不动摇，继续和灾害作斗争，终于最后战胜灾害，夺得了一次非常难得的丰收。
    连遭五场大灾，是大坏事，但用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨人，把大坏事变成了大好事。灾后的大寨建设得比以前更好了。为了争取明年更大的丰收，今年冬小麦播种面积，比去年扩大了三倍多。一条条修复的大沟坝，比原来更结实更壮观。虎头山上第一次出现了深水井。村里新修了一批青石窑洞和房子，并且把一个两丈多高的山头平成了大场院。大寨人还在为修建旱井群和引水渠等工程做准备，以进一步提高水利化的程度。
    今年，大寨活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，比过去更广泛、更深入、更扎实。从刚懂事的小孩子到七八十岁的老人，几乎人人学，人人用。他们在毛泽东思想的指引下，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，树立为革命种田的思想。来大寨参观的人问陈永贵：大寨的社员为什么这样能？陈永贵回答说：“因为我们学习了毛主席的书。”大寨人就是读了毛主席的书，掌握了毛泽东思想，才战胜今年的空前大灾，夺得思想、生产、农田建设三丰收的。正如社员们所说的那样：这威力大，那威力大，比不上毛泽东思想威力大；这一胜利，那一胜利，全都是毛泽东思想的胜利。（附图片）
