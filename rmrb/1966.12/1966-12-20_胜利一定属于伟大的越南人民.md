Today is the sixth anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The Chinese people extend their fighting, revolutionary greetings to the people of South Vietnam who dare to struggle and dare to win!

The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam represents the will of the people of South Vietnam and is their organizer, leader, and inspirer. Fourteen million people in South Vietnam are closely united around the National Liberation Front. The international prestige of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is growing higher and higher.

Over the past six years, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, the people of South Vietnam have raised the banner of resistance against America and national salvation, opened up the situation with guns, liberated most of the land in South Vietnam, and achieved brilliant victories. The people of South Vietnam have used the weapon of people's war to make the world's number one imperialist, the United States, suffer heavy losses and cry in pain. The struggle of the people of South Vietnam has greatly inspired all oppressed peoples and nations and has made a great contribution to the cause of the world people's anti-American struggle.

At present, the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people has entered a critical moment.

To achieve the complete liberation and unification of the motherland, to defend the victories already won, the Vietnamese people must certainly carry the struggle against American aggression to the end and drive the American aggressors out of Vietnamese territory without leaving a single one behind. Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call in July this year solemnly declared: "In the new situation, we resolutely unite as one, fearing neither hardship nor sacrifice, and resolutely complete our nation's glorious historical mission: to defeat the American aggressors!" The statement of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on December 15 also clearly stated: "No matter what sacrifices we have to endure, no matter how much the U.S. imperialists intensify and expand the war of aggression, no matter how long and arduous it may be, we will defeat the American aggressors and their traitorous lackeys." This is the firm principle of the Vietnamese people, this is the unshakable revolutionary resolve of the Vietnamese people.

The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership are colluding, playing dirty tricks of coercion, enticement, and persuasion, using both soft and hard tactics, aiming to make the Vietnamese people lay down their arms and stop the struggle. Recently, on the issue of the Christmas truce, the U.S., the Soviet revisionists, and all the ghosts and snakes are engaged in a counter-revolutionary grand alliance. They are coordinating with the U.S. to intensify the bombing of Hanoi, putting tremendous pressure on the Vietnamese people in a mad attempt to realize their grand conspiracy of "forcing peace through war."

The situation of the struggle is like this: The Vietnamese people, who have the firm support of all revolutionary peoples of the world, have made up their minds to carry the struggle against American aggression to the end. While the U.S. imperialists, modern revisionists, and their accomplices are using various means to try to make the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression falter halfway and extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people.

Chairman Mao said: "The oppressed peoples and nations can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle." The people of South Vietnam are doing just that.

The Vietnamese people are facing a great situation. The Vietnamese people are becoming stronger and stronger in the struggle. If six years ago, the revolutionary forces in South Vietnam were relatively weak, then today, the balance of power has undergone a tremendous change. The military and civilian forces of South Vietnam have grown into a very powerful revolutionary force. The initiative on the battlefield is increasingly in the hands of the Vietnamese people. The law of development of the people's revolutionary cause is like this: After persisting through a difficult period, the road to victory will come.

The U.S. imperialists are fierce on the surface but weak at the core. Under the heavy blows of the Vietnamese people, the former prestige of the U.S. imperialists has been completely swept away. Their situation is becoming more and more desperate. Their days are becoming worse and worse. Johnson's "Christmas Proclamation" is dejected, lamenting that the war in Vietnam "shows no signs of hope." The American aggressors have already fallen into the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war. Their doomsday is not far off.

The Chinese people have consistently supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. The Chinese people have long made up their minds and prepared in every way to take actions deemed necessary by the peoples of China and Vietnam at any time and place to jointly strike the American aggressors. A few days ago, the American bandit planes brazenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, attempting to use war threats to test the Chinese people's resolve to aid Vietnam and fight America. The U.S. imperialists are truly blind. We must frankly tell the Johnson government that even if the mountains crumble and the earth collapses, the Chinese people's resolve to fully support the Vietnamese people will not waver. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have further heightened their fighting spirit in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and are standing in full readiness. If the U.S. imperialists dare to expand the war and impose it on the Chinese people, we will resolutely fight back. The Chinese people stand firmly with the Vietnamese people and with all revolutionary peoples of the world, united in heart and mind, to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

    胜利一定属于伟大的越南人民
    今天，是越南南方民族解放阵线成立六周年的光辉节日。中国人民向敢于斗争、敢于胜利的越南南方人民致以战斗的、革命的敬礼！
    越南南方民族解放阵线代表着越南南方人民的意志，是他们的组织者、领导者和鼓舞者。一千四百万越南南方人民，紧密团结在民族解放阵线的周围。越南南方民族解放阵线的国际威望，越来越高。
    六年来，越南南方人民在民族解放阵线领导下，高举抗美救国的大旗，用枪杆子打开了局面，解放了越南南方的大部分土地，取得了辉煌的胜利。越南南方人民，用人民战争这个法宝，把世界上头号帝国主义打得焦头烂额，叫苦连天。越南南方人民的斗争，极大地鼓舞了一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，为世界人民反美斗争的事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    目前，越南人民的革命斗争，进入了一个关键的时刻。
    越南人民要实现祖国的彻底解放和完全统一，要保卫已经取得的胜利成果，就一定要把抗美救国斗争进行到底，就一定要把美国侵略者一个不留地赶出越南国土。胡志明主席今年七月的号召书庄严宣告：“在新的形势下，我们坚决同心协力，不怕一切艰苦和牺牲，坚决完成我们民族光荣的历史使命：战胜美国侵略强盗！”越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团十二月十五日的声明也明确表示：“无论要忍受任何牺牲，无论美帝国主义把侵略战争加强和扩大到什么程度，无论多么长期和艰苦，也要战胜美国侵略强盗及其卖国走狗。”这是越南人民坚定的原则立场，这是越南人民不可动摇的革命决心。
    美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团串通一气，玩弄迫和、诱和、劝和的肮脏手法，软硬兼施，目的是要越南人民放下武器，停止斗争。最近，在圣诞节停火问题上，美帝、苏修以及一切牛鬼蛇神，正在进行反革命的大纠合。它们配合美国加强轰炸河内的战争讹诈，向越南人民疯狂地施加压力，妄图实现“以战迫和”的大阴谋。
    斗争的形势就是这样：得到全世界革命人民坚决支持的越南人民，下定决心，要把抗美救国斗争进行到底。而美帝国主义、现代修正主义和它们的合伙者，则使用种种手段，力图使越南人民的抗美救国斗争半途而废，扑灭越南人民的革命烈火。
    毛主席说：被压迫人民和被压迫民族“只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。越南南方人民就是这样做的。”
    越南人民面临一片大好形势。越南人民越战越强。如果说，六年前，越南南方的革命力量还是相对的弱小的话，那么，今天，力量对比已经发生了巨大的变化。越南南方军民已经成长为一支十分强大的革命力量。战场上的主动权越来越转到了越南人民手里。人民革命事业的发展规律就是这样：坚持走过一段艰难的路程，胜利的坦途就会到来。
    美帝国主义表面上张牙舞爪，骨子里虚弱得很。在越南人民的沉重打击下，美帝国主义的昔日威风，扫地以尽。它的处境越来越狼狈。它的日子越来越不好过。约翰逊发表的“圣诞文告”，垂头丧气，哀叹侵越战争“看不到希望的迹象”。美国侵略者已经陷入越南人民战争的汪洋大海，它灭顶的日子，为期不远了。
    中国人民始终如一地支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。中国人民早已下定了决心，作好了各种准备，随时随地采取中越两国人民认为必要的行动，共同打击美国侵略者。前几天，美国强盗飞机悍然轰炸中国驻越南大使馆，妄图用战争恫吓来试探中国人民援越抗美的决心。美帝国主义真是瞎了眼。我们要坦率地奉告约翰逊政府，山可崩，地可塌，中国人民全力支援越南人民的决心决不动摇。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，在无产阶级文化大革命中更加提高了斗志，严阵以待。如果美帝国主义胆敢扩大战火、把战争强加在中国人民头上，我们坚决应战。中国人民紧紧地和越南人民在一起，紧紧地和全世界革命人民在一起，同心协力，彻底打败美国侵略者。
