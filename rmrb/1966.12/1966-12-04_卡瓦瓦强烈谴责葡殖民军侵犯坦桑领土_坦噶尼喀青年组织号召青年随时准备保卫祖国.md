Tanzania's Second Vice President Kawawa strongly condemned the Portuguese colonialists for invading Tanzanian territory and openly provoking Tanzania on November 30.

Kawawa, in a statement issued here, said that on the morning of November 29, Portuguese colonial troops crossed the Rufuma River from Mozambique and entered Tanzanian territory, laying mines and killing four Tanzanians and injuring five others. He said the Portuguese colonial troops invaded the vicinity of Maherenga village in Mtwara District in southern Tanzania.

Vice President Kawawa called on the people along the Tanzanian border to be on guard against the enemy and assist the Tanzanian People's Defense Force in safeguarding the country's security.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Dar es Salaam on December 2, the *Uhuru* newspaper published an editorial today stating that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners of Portugal must also bear responsibility for the recent Portuguese colonial troops' invasion of Tanzania.

The military provocation by the Portuguese colonialists has aroused great indignation among the broad masses of the people in Tanzania.

The Tanganyika African National Union Youth League issued a statement here yesterday, calling on all young people across the country to be vigilant against the enemy and be ready to defend the country at any time.
