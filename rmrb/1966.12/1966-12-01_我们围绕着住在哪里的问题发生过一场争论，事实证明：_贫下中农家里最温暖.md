We had a debate about where to stay, and it turned out that the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants are the warmest.

On the evening of October 31, we arrived at the reception station of Sha Village Brigade in Yi County, Henan. This reception station is quite remote, about ten miles away from Sha Village Brigade.

It was already dark. Everyone was tired and hungry from walking, so we took a temporary rest. At this time, a debate arose among the students: some suggested staying at the reception station; others firmly opposed this and insisted on continuing to Sha Village Brigade to stay with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Those who suggested staying at the reception station argued: "It's already dark, and everyone is quite tired. The living conditions at the reception station are also better..."

Those who insisted on continuing to Sha Village Brigade countered: "We are walking to connect with the masses to undergo hardship training and to go among the broad masses of workers and peasants to learn from them. We cannot just stay where it is comfortable." Another student said: "The village has many poor and lower-middle peasants, which is exactly where we can learn and propagate Chairman Mao's thoughts."

The result of the debate was that everyone agreed to continue on to Sha Village Brigade to camp.

At this point, it was even darker. The students braved the cold and hunger, walked another ten miles, and arrived at Sha Village Brigade.

Upon entering Sha Village, we were immediately warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. The brigade cadres and community members came to visit us, and the students studied "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with the masses. Sixteen-year-old female student Wang Wanling, enduring foot pain, enthusiastically taught the community members to sing songs from "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The community members were deeply moved and invited the students one by one to their homes for dinner. After dinner, we performed cultural programs we had rehearsed for the entire village community.

After the event, everyone summarized the events of that evening with excited hearts. The students said: The homes of poor and lower-middle peasants are the warmest. We would rather walk a little further to go among the masses and blend in with them.

### 我们围绕着住在哪里的问题发生过一场争论，事实证明：  贫下中农家里最温暖

    我们围绕着住在哪里的问题发生过一场争论，事实证明：
    贫下中农家里最温暖
    十月三十一日晚，我们来到河南汲县沙村大队的接待站。这个接待站比较偏僻，离沙村大队还有十多里路。
    天已经黑了。同学们个个走得又累又饿，就暂时歇了下来。这时候，同学们中间发生了争论：有的人主张住在接待站里；有的人坚决反对，主张继续前进，住到沙村大队贫下中农家中去。
    主张住在接待站的理由是：天已经黑了，人也相当累了，接待站的生活条件也比较好……。
    主张继续前进的同学反驳说：“我们徒步串连，就是为了艰苦锻炼，为了走到广大工农群众中去，向群众学习，决不能哪里舒服就住在哪里。”还有的同学说：“村子里有广大的贫下中农，正是我们学习毛泽东思想、宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。”
    争论的结果，大家一致同意继续前进，到沙村大队去宿营。
    这时，天更黑了。同学们顶住寒冷和饥饿，一气又走了十多里，来到了沙村大队。
    走进沙村，我们立即受到贫下中农的热烈欢迎。大队干部和社员来看望我们，同学们就和群众一起学习《毛主席语录》。十六岁的女同学王万灵，忍受着脚痛，兴致勃勃地教社员们唱毛主席语录歌。社员们非常感动，把同学们一个个拉到家里去吃饭。晚饭后，我们又在街头为全村社员演唱了自己排练的文艺节目。
    会后，大家以激动的心情，总结了当天晚上发生的事情。同学们说：贫下中农的家里最温暖，我们宁愿多走一点路，也要走到群众中去，和群众打成一片。
