Chairman Mao! Overseas Chinese youth will forever follow you in revolution!

“Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but we will never abandon Mao Zedong Thought!”

“We vow to defend Chairman Mao! We vow to defend the Party Central Committee! We vow to defend Mao Zedong Thought!”

In the afternoon of the 29th, at a welcoming ceremony for forty-one overseas Chinese young heroes, the overseas Chinese youth who had returned triumphantly from the frontlines of international class struggle, stood on the stage and raised their arms, shouting these solemn slogans. They once again expressed their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their boundless loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought.

Among the forty-one young heroes, He Derong, with a heart full of excitement, read aloud the letter they had written to Chairman Mao while in an Indonesian prison. Then, holding the letter, he went to Comrade Zhou Enlai and said excitedly, “Comrade Premier Zhou, we overseas Chinese youth miss Chairman Mao very much. We wish Chairman Mao eternal life!” At that moment, his comrades standing beside him all shouted, “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!” Comrade Zhou Enlai, amidst the cheers, took the letter they had written to Chairman Mao and shook He Derong’s hand tightly, expressing his warm regards to the young heroes.

Nineteen-year-old Zheng Xiancai, along with ten female youths from the group of forty-one young heroes, had embroidered a red flag with the words “Long live Chairman Mao” in an Indonesian prison. Today, at this unforgettable and happy moment, she held up high the red flag they had brought back from the foreign prison, and then held up the five-pointed star made by the male youths in prison, with a portrait of Chairman Mao in the center and forty-one small red stars surrounding it. Facing the crowd, tears in her eyes, she said, “The vast overseas Chinese community misses Chairman Mao very much and loves Chairman Mao dearly. It is the great Mao Zedong Thought that ensured our victory in this international class struggle. To express our boundless love for Chairman Mao and our boundless loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, we made these two gifts in prison to present to the reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. We wish Chairman Mao eternal life!”

At this moment, the entire venue erupted in applause, and the shouts of “Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!” grew louder and louder. Then, Zheng Xiancai and the youngest member of the forty-one young heroes, thirteen-year-old Liao Shengchang, each holding the red flag and the five-pointed star, approached Comrade Zhou Enlai and asked him to convey these two gifts to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Comrade Zhou Enlai nodded repeatedly and held their hands tightly for a long time. Zheng Xiancai and Liao Shengchang raised their arms and shouted, “We wish Chairman Mao eternal life!”

Comrade Kang Sheng presented each of the heroic overseas Chinese youth with a copy of “Selected Works of Mao Zedong.” At this moment, the excitement in the venue reached another peak. Comrade Kang Sheng said to the overseas Chinese youth, “This is the most precious book, the best weapon to defeat all reactionaries! You must follow Comrade Lin Biao’s instructions, study Chairman Mao’s books, study them for a lifetime, and revolutionize for a lifetime!”

The young heroes took the revolutionary treasures and held them to their chests, warming their hearts. Tears shone in their eyes as they made firm vows to the central leaders:

	“I will definitely master Mao Zedong Thought!”

	“I will study Chairman Mao’s books, listen to Chairman Mao’s words, and act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions. I will be a good soldier of Chairman Mao!”

	“I will study Chairman Mao’s books for a lifetime and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution!”

Comrade Kang Sheng, with a face full of smiles, affectionately said to them, “Yes! You must study Chairman Mao’s works and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution!”

At this moment, the overseas Chinese youth, along with the Red Guards and revolutionary masses, sang loudly, “The ship sails on the sea relying on the helmsman,” and “Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao.” People felt proud that Mao Zedong Thought had nurtured heroic overseas Chinese youth and sang heartily the songs of the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    毛主席啊！华侨小将永远跟着您干革命！
    “头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢！”
    “誓死捍卫毛主席！誓死捍卫党中央！誓死捍卫毛泽东思想！”
    二十九日下午，在欢迎四十一名华侨小英雄的大会上，从国际阶级斗争前线凯旋回国的华侨小将，在主席台上振臂高呼着这些庄严的口号，再一次表达了他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对毛泽东思想的无限忠诚。
    四十一名小英雄集体中的何德荣，怀着万分激动的心情，在会上朗读了他们在印尼监狱中写给伟大领袖毛主席的信。接着他捧着这封信来到周恩来同志面前，激动地说：“周总理啊！我们华侨青少年非常想念毛主席，我们祝毛主席万寿无疆！”这时，站在他旁边的战友们一齐高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”周恩来同志在欢呼声中，接过他们写给毛主席的信，紧紧握住何德荣的手，向小将们表示亲切的慰问。
    十九岁的郑仙彩，同四十一名小英雄集体中的十名女青年一起，在印尼牢狱中，绣制了一面有“毛主席万岁”五个大字的红旗。今天，在这个难忘的幸福时刻，她双手高举这面从异国牢狱中带回祖国的红旗，接着又举起男青少年们在狱中制作的中间贴着毛主席像，周围簇拥着四十一颗小红星的五角星，面向万众，热泪盈眶地说：“我们海外广大侨胞非常想念毛主席，无限热爱毛主席。正是伟大的毛泽东思想，保证了我们在这场国际阶级斗争中取得了最后胜利。为了表达我们对毛主席的无限热爱和对毛泽东思想的无限忠诚，我们在狱中做了这两件礼物，献给我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    这时，全场掌声雷动，“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的口号声一浪高过一浪。接着，郑仙彩和四十一名小英雄集体中年龄最小的十三岁的廖盛昌，分别举着红旗和捧着五角星，迎着周恩来同志，请他把这两件礼物转给最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。周恩来同志连连点头，久久地紧握着他们的手。郑仙彩和廖盛昌举臂高呼：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    康生同志向一个个英雄的华侨小将们发了《毛泽东选集》。这时候会场上的热烈气氛达到了又一个高潮。康生同志向华侨小将们说：“这是最珍贵的书，这是战胜一切反动派的最好武器！你们要执行林彪同志的指示，好好读毛主席的书，读一辈子毛主席的书，干一辈子革命！”
    小将们接过革命宝书，捧在胸前，暖在心里。他们脸上闪着泪花，向中央领导同志发出了坚定的誓言：
      “我一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手！”
      “我要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士！”
      “我一定要读一辈子毛主席的书，永远跟着毛主席干革命！”
    康生同志满面笑容，亲切地对他们说：“对啊！你们要好好学习毛主席著作，要永远跟着毛主席干革命！”
    这时候，华侨青少年同红卫兵和革命群众，放声唱起《大海航行靠舵手》、《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》。人们为毛泽东思想哺育出英雄的海外中华儿女而感到自豪，尽情地高唱着毛泽东思想伟大胜利的赞歌。
