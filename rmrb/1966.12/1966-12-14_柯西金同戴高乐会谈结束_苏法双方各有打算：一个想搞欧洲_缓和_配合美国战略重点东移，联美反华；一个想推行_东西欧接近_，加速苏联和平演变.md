Kosygin Ends Talks with De Gaulle: Both Sides Have Their Own Plans
According to Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 10th: At the invitation of French President Charles de Gaulle, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited France from December 1st to 9th and held talks with de Gaulle. This visit and talks are a continuation of the discussions held during de Gaulle's visit to the Soviet Union in June this year. According to the joint statement released on the 9th, both sides "discussed major political issues in the world and the development of bilateral relations," including European security, Vietnam, and "economic aid" to countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

	According to various sources, the rapprochement between France and the Soviet Union is driven by different motives. While the Soviet revisionist leadership is engaging in a rapprochement with the United States, it is also strengthening ties with France to promote "détente" in Europe, aligning with the U.S. strategic shift towards the East, and collaborating with the U.S. against China. At the same time, the Soviet Union seeks France's assistance in pushing the "peace talks" deception in Vietnam.

	For de Gaulle, over the past few years, he has been launching a comprehensive counterattack against the United States in politics, military, and economics to maintain French independence and expel U.S. influence in Europe. Meanwhile, he is exploiting the current conditions in the Soviet Union, such as the resurgence of capitalism, to promote the rapprochement between Eastern and Western Europe, particularly Franco-Soviet "cooperation," aiming to accelerate the peaceful evolution of the Soviet Union. He also aims to counter pro-American West Germany and expand French influence across Europe.

	According to reports, during the talks, the Soviet leaders again proposed the idea of convening a "European Security Conference." However, France insists that such a conference can only be held after the complete peaceful evolution of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, i.e., after the so-called "East-West reconciliation," and not before. The joint statement says that only after changes occur in the relations between European countries will it be "possible to gradually create favorable conditions for discussing the major unresolved issues in Europe." From this statement, it appears that the Soviet Union has accommodated France's position, willing to sacrifice the interests of the Soviet and Eastern European peoples to promote the "East-West reconciliation" policy.

	On the Vietnam issue, the Soviet leaders are eager to serve the U.S. "peace talks" conspiracy. In this period, they have frequently discussed the matter with officials from the United States, Britain, and Canada. This time, Kosygin also discussed the issue with de Gaulle. The joint statement, when mentioning Vietnam, does not condemn U.S. aggression nor demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam. Instead, it vaguely refers to the serious situation in Vietnam as resulting from "external interference." This stance is even more retrograde than France's usual criticism of U.S. intervention and demand for the withdrawal of U.S. troops.

	The joint statement concludes that to coordinate the positions of France and the Soviet Union, both sides agree that Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Nikolai Podgorny, and French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou will visit each other at an appropriate time.

### 柯西金同戴高乐会谈结束  苏法双方各有打算：一个想搞欧洲“缓和”配合美国战略重点东移，联美反华；一个想推行“东西欧接近”，加速苏联和平演变

    柯西金同戴高乐会谈结束
    苏法双方各有打算：一个想搞欧洲“缓和”配合美国战略重点东移，联美反华；一个想推行“东西欧接近”，加速苏联和平演变
    据新华社巴黎十日电应法国总统戴高乐的邀请，苏联部长会议主席柯西金一日到九日在法国进行了访问，并同戴高乐举行了会谈。这次苏法会谈是今年六月戴高乐访苏时双方会谈的继续。据九日发表的两国会谈联合声明说，双方“讨论了世界的主要政治问题和双边关系的发展”，其中包括欧洲安全、越南、对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家的“经济援助”等问题。
    据各方面透露的消息表明，法苏接近是各有打算的。苏联修正主义领导集团在大搞苏美勾结的同时，正在继续同法国拉关系，以便在欧洲大搞“缓和”，配合美国战略重点东移，联美反华。同时，苏联还想在推行越南“和谈”骗局方面得到法国的帮助。
    对戴高乐来说，几年来，他一方面在政治上、军事上和经济上向美国展开全面反击，以维护法国的独立，排挤美国在欧洲的势力；另一方面他正利用苏联目前出现的国内资本主义复辟等条件，推行东西欧接近，特别是法苏“合作”的政策，以加速苏联的和平演变，同时抵制亲美的西德，进而扩展法国在整个欧洲的势力。
    据报道，苏联领导人在会谈中又提出召开“欧洲安全会议”的建议，但是法国坚持认为，这一会议只能在苏联和东欧国家完全和平演变以后，即所谓“东西欧和解”以后举行，而不能在和解之前举行。联合声明说，要等欧洲国家间关系发生变化后才“有可能逐步为讨论欧洲所存在的重大的悬而未决问题创造有利条件”，从这一句话看来，苏联对法国的立场作了迎合，不惜出卖苏联和东欧各国人民的利益，来推行“东西欧和解”政策。
    在越南问题上，苏联领导人急于为美国“和谈”阴谋效劳。这一时期来，他们曾同美国、英国、加拿大政府负责人士进行了频繁的讨论。这次，柯西金又同戴高乐会谈了这一问题，联合声明在谈到越南问题时根本没有谴责美国侵略，也没有要求美国军队撤出越南，却笼统地提越南严重的局势是产生于“外部干涉”。这甚至比法国平时指责美国干涉并且要求美军撤退的立场还退了一步。
    联合声明最后说，为了协调法苏间的立场，双方确认，苏联共产党中央委员会总书记勃列日涅夫、最高苏维埃主席团主席波德戈尔内和法国总理蓬皮杜将于适当时期相互访问。
