The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a statement on December 16, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' continuous aerial bombardment of Hanoi and calling on the Vietnamese people to carry out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call for more heroic struggle to defeat the American aggressors.

The statement said that the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front fully supports the statement issued by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 14, 1966, and calls on the people of the world to stop the bloody crimes of U.S. imperialism and strongly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.

The statement said that for the independence and freedom of the motherland, for the peace of Asia and the world, the Vietnamese people are determined to carry the anti-American, national salvation struggle to the end. The more obstinate the U.S. imperialists are, the more miserable their defeat will be. The 31 million people of the whole country will not waver and are ready to make the greatest sacrifices at any time to defeat the American aggressors.

The statement finally called on the Vietnamese people to thoroughly carry out Chairman Ho Chi Minh's sacred call for anti-American, national salvation, to unite as one, to pool all their efforts, to fight more fiercely and more ruthlessly against the American aggressors, to smash the U.S. imperialist aggression, to liberate the South, to defend the North, and to unify the country.
