Dearest comrades in arms—Red Guards!

You asked me to share my experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works diligently and growing through struggle. I feel quite ashamed; what experience do I have to share? However, since you all have brought it up, I will share a bit of my personal experience with the attitude of learning from you, helping each other, and making progress together.

In the spring of 1959, I participated in the campaign to pacify Tibet. Once, we were tasked with pursuing and annihilating the fleeing enemy. Everyone carried weapons and equipment weighing fifty to sixty pounds, marching day and night through rugged, snowy mountains. The day after we set out, my feet were covered in blisters and blood blisters, and the soles of my feet were skinned. Every step forward was like being stabbed with needles. Just as I was about to give up, the platoon leader was at the front of the column, leading everyone in reciting Chairman Mao's poem, "The Red Army fears no hardships, ten thousand mountains and rivers are as nothing." I also joined in the recitation. At that moment, I thought of Chairman Mao leading the Red Army over the snow-capped mountains and through the grasslands, and I felt warm all over, as if Chairman Mao were by my side, kindly saying, "Little soldier, you are fighting for the people's cause!" With this thought, all the cold and fatigue disappeared, and I felt full of energy. When the battle began, I was wounded in the neck and legs, and blood was flowing. Seeing that my injuries were severe, my comrades advised me to rest in the rear. But how could I rest? After being wounded, old and new grievances surged in my heart: I thought of the inhuman life I had as a cowherd for the landlord at the age of six or seven; I thought of my Tibetan class brothers whose eyes were gouged out, hands and feet chopped off, and ears and noses cut off by the serf owners; I thought of the bloodthirsty crimes of those serf owners who used the skulls of our class brothers as drinking cups and the arm bones of young girls as musical instruments. Thinking of these things, my pain and fatigue were forgotten, and I had only one thought: the rebels must be annihilated, and the Tibetan class brothers must be liberated; I could not stop fighting for a moment! I gritted my teeth, endured the pain, and never left the front line. In the mountains, I and my comrades pursued the rebels for over forty days, successfully completing our mission.

In the spring of 1964, the organization promoted me from squad leader to deputy platoon leader. At that time, I felt very uneasy, thinking that my education was low and my abilities were poor, and suddenly I had to bear such a heavy responsibility. The difficulties were indeed many. But then I thought, this mindset was wrong. I opened "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and compared myself with Chairman Mao's teaching, "Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." I found that my confidence was not enough, and my courage to strive for victory was not enough. During the self-examination, I also recalled the situation in Tibet: at that time, our platoon leader was not on duty, and the leadership asked me to act as his deputy. Before setting out, I was very worried that I had no combat experience and feared that I could not complete the mission. However, once on the front line, after recalling bitterness with the Tibetan people, denouncing the old society, and especially studying Chairman Mao's instructions to dare to struggle and dare to win, all my worries disappeared. I only wanted to rush into battle quickly and annihilate all those rebels who had grown fat on the blood and sweat of the people, avenging the Tibetan people. On the battlefield, I firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "This army has an indomitable spirit, it will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by the enemy." I led the entire platoon of soldiers to fight fiercely, charging straight into the enemy's lair, fighting right under the enemy's nose, and displaying the spirit of lone-wolf combat. Finally, we successfully completed the mission. This experience made me further understand: a revolutionary soldier, no matter what revolutionary work he does, to do it well, the key is not the size of his abilities, but whether he has revolutionary courage and the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly.

Having found the root cause and made up my mind, I often used "completely" and "thoroughly" as a mirror, and the two "extremes" as a measure, to fiercely struggle against selfish thoughts. I firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "The masses are the real heroes," and humbly regarded the masses as my teachers. From the highest commander to the lowest soldier in the company, I actively sought their guidance. In this way, I overcame various difficulties and shouldered the heavy responsibilities given to me by the Party and the people.

The wings of an eagle are tempered in storms; fearless soldiers are forged in the battlefield of gunfire and shelling. Dear Red Guard comrades, we all know that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a great innovation in the socialist revolution and an extremely fierce, sharp, and profound class struggle. I hope that in this struggle, you will strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently, temper yourselves to be even stronger, and truly become pioneers of the times.

### 迎着斗争的考验阔步前进

    迎着斗争的考验阔步前进
    广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子　张仲明最亲爱的战友——红卫兵小将们！
    你们要我谈谈自己在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作、在斗争中锻炼成长的经验，我感到很惭愧。我有什么经验可以谈呢？不过，大家既然提出来了，我只得抱着向你们学习、相互帮助、共同进步的态度，谈一点点亲身经历的事情。
    一九五九年春天，我参加了西藏平叛的战斗。有一次，我们接受了追歼逃敌的任务，大家背着五、六十斤重的武器装备，在崎岖不平的雪山上，昼夜奔袭。出发后的第二天，我的双脚便打满了水泡、血泡，脚板破了一层皮。每向前移动一步，都痛得像针扎一样。正当我有些支持不住的时候，指导员走在队伍最前头，领着大家朗诵毛主席“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲”的诗句。我也跟着朗诵起来。这时，我联想到当年毛主席率领红军爬雪山、过草地的艰难情景，心里只觉得热乎乎的，好像毛主席他老人家就在我的身旁，慈祥地对我说：“小战士呵，你是在为人民利益而战斗！”想到这里，什么寒冷、疲劳，一下子全跑光了！只觉得浑身有使不完的劲。战斗打响后，我颈部、腿部两处受了伤，鲜血直流。同志们见我伤势较重，都劝我留在后面休息。可是我怎么能够休息？负伤以后，新仇旧恨一齐涌上了心头：我想起六、七岁就给地主放牛的非人生活；想起那些被农奴主挖掉眼睛，剁掉手脚，割掉耳朵、鼻子的藏族阶级兄弟的血泪控诉；想起那些吃人的农奴主用我们的阶级兄弟的脑壳做酒杯，用少女的肱骨做乐器的血腥罪行……。想到这些，我的伤痛、疲劳，全都忘了，心中只有一个念头：叛匪一天不消灭，西藏的阶级兄弟一天不解放，我就一刻也不能停止战斗！我咬紧牙关，忍着伤痛，始终不下火线。在雪山上，我和同志们一起，一直坚持追击叛匪四十多天，胜利完成了战斗任务。
    一九六四年春天，组织上把我从班长提升为连副指导员。当时，我心里很不踏实，觉得自己文化低，能力差，一下子要挑这么重的担子，困难实在很多。但转念一想，觉得这种情绪不对头。我翻开“老三篇”，用毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”的教导一对照，就发现自己信心还不足，争取胜利的勇气还不够。在对照检查时，我又回忆了西藏平叛的情况：当时，我们排的排长不在职，领导上叫我代理他的工作。临出发前，我很担心自己没有作战经验，怕指挥不好，完不成任务。但是，到了前线，经过和西藏人民一起忆苦，控诉旧社会，特别是学习了毛主席的敢于斗争，敢于胜利的指示后，担心全没了，我只想赶快上阵，把那些用人民血汗养肥的叛乱分子统统消灭，为西藏人民报仇雪恨。上了战场，我牢记毛主席“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的教导，带领全排战士猛打猛冲，直插敌穴，贴着敌人的鼻子底下打，发扬了孤胆作战的精神，终于出色地完成了任务。这段经历的回忆，使我进一步明白了：一个革命战士，无论干哪一件革命工作，要干好，关键不在于能力的大小，而在于有没有革命的勇气，有没有全心全意为人民服务的思想。
    根子找到了，决心下定了，我就经常以“完全”、“彻底”为镜子，两个“极端”为尺子，狠斗私心杂念。我牢记毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，虚心拜群众为师，上至师首长，下至连队战士，我都主动向他们求教。这样，我就不断战胜了各种困难，挑起了党和人民给我的重担子。
    雄鹰的翅膀，是在暴风雨中练出来的；无畏的战士，是在枪林弹雨的战场上闯出来的。亲爱的红卫兵战友们，我们都知道，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是社会主义革命的伟大创举，是一场极其激烈、极其尖锐、极其深刻的阶级斗争。希望你们在这场斗争中，努力活学活用毛主席著作，把自己锻炼得更加坚强，真正成为时代的闯将。
