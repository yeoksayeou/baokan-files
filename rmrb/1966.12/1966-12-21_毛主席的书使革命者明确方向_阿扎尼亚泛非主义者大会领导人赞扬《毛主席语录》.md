According to Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, December 19th. Moret, the Secretary of Propaganda and News for the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), who is currently visiting here, said on the 17th to a reporter from Xinhua News Agency, "The publication of the foreign-language version of the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is a significant event, as it answers many practical questions for the revolutionary people who are engaged in anti-imperialist struggles."

He said, "Chairman Mao's works are rich in content, easy to understand, and cover revolutionary theory, construction policies, struggles against enemies, and issues of unity among friends and comrades. They are filled with experiences from various struggles. Therefore, truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought means being able to do all kinds of work well. As long as we arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, we will have a clear direction."

He mentioned that he had visited many African countries and personally witnessed how many revolutionaries from Asia and Africa love this little red book. They carry it wherever they go and often take it out of their pockets during discussions to quote Chairman Mao's words to illustrate their points. He said, "This book has become a long-term need for the revolutionary people of the world." He particularly praised Chairman Mao's theories on distinguishing between friends and enemies, armed struggle, the decisive factor in war being people rather than weapons, criticism, and self-criticism.

When talking about Mao Zedong Thought, he said, "We are convinced that the sun has risen in the East, and its radiance will illuminate the entire world." He then recited Chairman Mao's statement, "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers," and "To disturb, to fail, to disturb again, to fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause." He said, "Many of Chairman Mao's articles, although written many years ago, are still very relevant today, as if they were written yesterday, or even today."

    毛主席的书使革命者明确方向
    阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会领导人赞扬《毛主席语录》
    据新华社阿尔及尔十九日电　正在这里访问的阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会宣传和新闻书记莫雷特十七日在这里对新华社记者说，《毛主席语录》外文版发行是一件大事，因为《毛主席语录》回答了正在进行反帝斗争的革命人民的许多实际问题。
    他说，毛主席著作内容丰富，通俗易懂，既有革命理论，又有建设方针，既有对敌斗争，又有对待朋友和同志的团结问题，充满了各方面的斗争经验。“所以真正掌握了毛泽东思想，就可以做好一切工作”。“只要我们用毛泽东思想武装起来，我们就会有明确的方向”。
    他说，他曾访问过不少非洲国家，亲眼看到许多亚非国家的革命者非常喜欢这本红书，他们走到哪里，带到哪里，在讨论问题时也常从口袋里掏出来，以便引用毛主席的话来说明问题。他说，“这本书已成了世界革命人民长时期的需要”。他特别赞扬毛主席关于分清敌友、武装斗争、战争的决定因素是人而不是武器、批评和自我批评等方面的理论。
    他在谈到毛泽东思想时说：“我们确信，太阳已从东方升起，它的光辉将照耀全世界。”他接着背诵了毛主席关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论断以及“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑”等语录。他说，毛主席的许多文章虽然写了有许多年了，但是现在读起来还非常亲切，就像是昨天、甚至是今天写的。
