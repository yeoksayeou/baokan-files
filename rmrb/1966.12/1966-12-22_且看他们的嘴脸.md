	Observe Their True Colors
	Beijing Drama Academy	Gē Xīnwú

	The clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Committee has been relentlessly promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line that opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary path in our school. They oppose the revolution of Peking opera, viewing revolutionary modern plays as a thorn in their side, while they fondly remember and praise traditional operas. Their true colors are truly despicable and detestable.

	Here are a few examples for public exposure.

	Human by Day, Ghost by Night

	The main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Committee are typical examples of those who wave the red flag to oppose it. They have two faces regarding the reform of Peking opera—one in the open and one in secret. By day, they are human; by night, they are ghosts. During the 1964 National Peking Opera Modern Play Festival, they wrote articles and gave speeches, praising revolutionary modern plays. However, as soon as night fell, they would sneak back to their "leisure palace," close the doors, and enjoy their emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, as well as ghosts and snakes.

	Glaring at the "Red Lantern," Smiling at the "White Snake"

	The 1964 National Peking Opera Modern Play Festival was like a thunderclap that shook the entire drama world, the nation, and the world. Revolutionary modern plays began to take over the Peking opera stage. However, the former Beijing Municipal Committee held our school in a tight grip, not allowing us to rehearse the revolutionary model opera "The Red Lantern" until April 1965. When we repeatedly requested to rehearse it, the black "edict" from the former Beijing Municipal Committee came down: rehearse the entire "The Legend of the White Snake."

	See how clear their likes and dislikes are!

	Seven Parts Traditional Plays, Three Parts Modern Plays

	When emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties were driven off the stage, they realized they were powerless to resist. Thus, they tried every means to interfere with the teaching of drama schools. Revolutionary model operas like "The Red Lantern" and "Shajiabang" were not allowed to be included in the teaching repertoire. They attempted to maintain the dominance of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties in the teaching field. As late as last September, the former Beijing Municipal Committee's propaganda chief and counter-revolutionary revisionist Li Qi conveyed his master's orders, loudly proclaiming that in professional teaching, the foundation must be traditional plays, with a ratio of seven parts traditional plays to three parts modern plays. Clearly, their so-called "foundation" is not for performing revolutionary modern plays but for preparing the revival of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties.

	Viciously Abusing the Symphony "Shajiabang"

	One day, the main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Committee asked a few people from our school, "Have you seen the symphony 'Shajiabang'?" The answer was, "Yes, I have." He then asked, "What do you think?" The answer was, "It's quite good, just like a song." This counter-revolutionary revisionist, upon hearing this, viciously abused, saying, "This play is rotten to the core. The other day, the newspaper published an article praising it, saying it is popular among the people. They didn't come down to ask who likes to watch it!"

	The Unseen Play List

	Under the direct control of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, from April 1965 to March 1966, our school rehearsed and performed the following plays: "The Legend of the White Snake," "The Garden of Young Phoenixes," "Yandang Mountain," "The Broken Bridge," "Carrying the Seal," "Crying and Complaining," "Iron Dragon Mountain," "Jade Hall Spring," "Selling Water," "Watching the River," and "Appointing the Commander." The main leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Committee often invited some "business elites" to their homes, specifically requesting them to sing those reactionary and vulgar plays, and shamelessly said, "You can sing anything in my home. I have the analytical ability..."

	"The golden monkey wields the thousand-pound rod, and the jade sky clears the dust for ten thousand miles." Now is the time to thoroughly settle the accounts of the former Beijing Municipal Committee's long-term crimes against the party and socialism, and thoroughly eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist filth and poison they have spread!

    且看他们的嘴脸
    北京戏剧专科学校　戈辛芜
    旧北京市委的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在我校一直推行着一条与毛主席革命文艺路线相对抗的反革命修正主义文艺黑线。他们反对京剧革命，把革命现代戏看成是眼中钉，对旧戏则念念不忘，吹捧备至。他们的嘴脸实在可恶可憎。
    现举几例示众。
    白天是人，夜晚是鬼
    旧北京市委主要负责人，是打着“红旗”反红旗的典型，他们对于京剧改革是阳一套，阴一套，白天是人，夜晚是鬼。一九六四年全国京剧革命现代戏会演期间，他们白天写文章做报告，满嘴革命现代戏。可是一到夜晚就偷偷地回到“逍遥宫”里，关起门欣赏他们的帝王将相、才子佳人、牛鬼蛇神去了。
    怒视“红灯”，笑对“白蛇”
    一九六四年的全国京剧革命现代戏会演，像一声春雷震动了整个戏剧界，震动了全国，震动了全世界，革命现代戏开始占领了京剧舞台。可是旧北京市委却把我校卡得死死的，直到一九六五年四月还不让我们排演革命样板戏《红灯记》。当我们再三要求排演时，旧北京市委的黑“圣旨”下来了：排练全部《白蛇传》。
    看，他们的爱憎是多么鲜明！
    七分传统戏，三分现代戏
    当帝王将相、才子佳人被赶出舞台的时候，他们自量无力抵抗，于是就千方百计在戏剧学校教学上打主意。革命样板戏《红灯记》《沙家浜》等一律不准列入教学的排练剧目，妄想在教学领域维护帝王将相、才子佳人戏的统治地位。直到去年九月旧北京市委宣传部长、反革命修正主义分子李琪还传达他主子的意旨，大肆叫嚷业务教学上一定要以传统戏打基础，比例应该七分传统戏，三分现代戏。可见他们所谓的“打基础”，绝不是为演革命现代戏打基础，而是给帝王将相、才子佳人戏的复活做准备。
    破口大骂交响音乐《沙家浜》
    有一天，旧北京市委主要负责人问我校几个人：“你看过交响音乐《沙家浜》吗？”答：“看过了。”他又问：“怎么样？”答：“不错，就是像歌子。”这个反革命修正主义分子听了以后，破口大骂说：“这戏坏透了。前两天报纸上还登了一篇赞扬的稿件，说它被人民喜闻乐见，他们也不下来问问，有谁爱看！”
    见不得人的“剧目表”
    我校在旧北京市委的直接把持下，从一九六五年四月到一九六六年三月一年间，彩排和演出了些什么呢？请看下面这张“剧目表”：《白蛇传》《雏凤花园》《雁荡山》《断桥》《捧印》《哭诉》《铁龙山》《玉堂春》《卖水》《望江亭》和《挂帅出征》……。旧北京市委主要负责人还经常把一些业务“尖子”请到他们家里，专门点那些反动的、低级下流的戏来唱，并无耻地说：“你们在我家什么都能唱，我有分析力……。”
      “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”现在，是彻底清算旧北京市委长期犯下的反党反社会主义罪行，彻底清除他们散布的反革命修正主义污秽毒素的时候了！
