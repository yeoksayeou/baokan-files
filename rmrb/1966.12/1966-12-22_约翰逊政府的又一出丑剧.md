Title: Another Farce by the Johnson Administration

The Johnson administration has staged another farce of "bombing for peace."

After U.S. air pirates continuously bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, Johnson immediately instructed the U.S. representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, to write a letter on December 19 to U Thant, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, asking him to help the U.S. realize its "peace talks" plot. Bombs followed by "peace talks" tricks—this is the most blatant and shameless extortion of the Vietnamese people.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has been eagerly serving the U.S. "bombing for peace" plot. Recently, Moscow has been receiving Western dignitaries one after another, while also sending officials abroad to actively collaborate with the U.S.'s new "peace talks" scam. Meanwhile, surrounding the so-called "Christmas truce," the Pope, the United Nations Secretary-General, and various "peace talks" brokers have all come out to perform. They all appear "impartial," putting on a face of "mediators." Now, the U.S. representative has publicly stepped forward to write a letter to U Thant, thus the main actor of this "bombing for peace" farce by U.S. imperialism has come from behind the scenes to the forefront. At the same time, it has also exposed the true face of the Soviet revisionist leadership in betraying the Vietnamese revolution, and it has also exposed the true nature of the "peace talks" and "truce" scams peddled by the Pope and the United Nations Secretary-General, all of which are genuine U.S. products.

U.S. imperialism thinks that bombs are omnipotent, that they can intimidate revolutionary people. As long as the U.S. drops a few bombs on Hanoi, and then finds some accomplices and lackeys to come out, demanding that the Vietnamese people accept "peace talks," the job will be done. However, U.S. imperialism has misjudged the situation and completely misread its target.

Revolutionary people fear neither heaven nor earth, let alone bombs! The Vietnamese people are such steadfast and unyielding people. The Vietnamese people have long decided not to fear breaking pots and pans, not to fear making great sacrifices, and are determined to complete the cause of national liberation and reunification. Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared in his call: "Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated," "When the day of victory comes, our people will rebuild our country more magnificently and more splendidly!" What a magnificent oath! In the face of such heroic people, what bombing, what extortion, what threats, are all useless.

Chairman Mao said: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish always make their last struggles against revolutionary forces."

Today, U.S. imperialism's situation in the Vietnam issue is already at a dead end. Bombing, coercing, enticing—all kinds of means have been used, but the result is still that "peace talks" cannot be achieved. Johnson colluding with U Thant, hurriedly playing the "peace talks" scam again, is even more shameful. This is another exposure of the cunning and weak nature of U.S. imperialism. Every time U.S. imperialism plays the "bombing for peace" trick, it is not only a prelude to expanding its aggression but also a reflection of its increasing desperation. No matter how U.S. imperialism struggles, it cannot save itself from its inevitable failure.

    约翰逊政府的又一出丑剧
    本报评论员
    约翰逊政府精心策划的又一出“以炸迫和”丑剧上演了。
    在美国空中强盗连续几次轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内之后，约翰逊马上指令美国驻联合国代表戈德堡于十二月十九日写信给联合国秘书长吴丹，要他出面来帮助美国实现“和谈”阴谋。炸弹的后面紧跟着“和谈”把戏，这是对越南人民最露骨、最无耻的讹诈。
    苏联修正主义领导集团一直起劲地为美国的“以炸迫和”阴谋奔走效劳。最近以来，莫斯科一方面接二连三地接待西方要人，一方面不断派要员到国外活动，来积极配合美国的“和谈”新骗局。同时，围绕着所谓“圣诞节休战”，罗马教皇、联合国秘书长，以及形形色色的“和谈”掮客，也都出来表演一番。他们都貌似“公正”，装出一副“和事佬”的面孔。现在，美国代表公开出面写信给吴丹，这样美帝国主义这个“以炸迫和”丑剧的主角，就从后台走到了前台。同时，也就赤裸裸地暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团出卖越南革命的真面目，也赤裸裸地暴露了罗马教皇和联合国秘书长所兜售的“和谈”和“休战”骗局，统统是地地道道的美国货。
    美帝国主义以为，炸弹是万能的，是能够把革命人民吓倒的。只要美国对河内扔下几次炸弹，然后再找一些帮凶和走卒出来，要越南人民接受“和谈”，事情就成功了。但是，美帝国主义错误地估计了形势，完全看错了对象。
    革命的人民天不怕，地不怕，还怕什么炸弹！越南人民就是这样坚强不屈的人民。越南人民早就下定决心，不怕打破坛坛罐罐，不怕作出重大牺牲，一定要完成祖国解放和统一的事业。胡志明主席在号召书中庄严宣告：“河内、海防和其他一些城市、企业可能被摧毁，但是越南人民是不会被吓倒的”，“在胜利的日子到来的时候，我国人民将重新把自己的祖国建设得更加堂皇，更加壮丽！”这是何等豪迈的誓言！在这样的英雄人民面前，什么轰炸，什么讹诈，什么威胁，通通是没用的。
    毛主席说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。
    美帝国主义今天在越南问题上的处境，已经山穷水尽。炸呀，迫呀，诱呀，各种手段都使出来了，结果还是搞不成“和谈”。约翰逊串通吴丹，急急忙忙再一次玩弄“和谈”骗局，更是丑态毕露。这是美帝国主义的狡诈和虚弱本质的又一次暴露。美帝国主义每搞一次“以炸迫和”的把戏，固然是它扩大侵略战争的前奏，也是它越来越走投无路的反映。美帝国主义不管怎样挣扎，都挽救不了它的必然失败的命运。
