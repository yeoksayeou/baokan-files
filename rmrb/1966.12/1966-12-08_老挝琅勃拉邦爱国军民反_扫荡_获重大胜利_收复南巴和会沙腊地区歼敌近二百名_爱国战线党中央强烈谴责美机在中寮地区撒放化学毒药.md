Patriotic military and civilians in Luang Prabang, Laos, achieved a major victory in their anti-sweeping operations in November, eliminating nearly 200 enemy troops and recapturing several regions.

On November 7, the patriotic military and civilians in Luang Prabang Province launched a fierce counterattack against the enemy forces that had invaded the Nam Ba and Huai Xai areas. They killed 44 enemy troops, wounded many, and seized one heavy machine gun and 200 hand grenades. On November 11, the patriotic military and civilians again counterattacked the enemy forces invading the Huai Xai area, killing 42 enemy troops, wounding many, and forcing 10 enemy troops to surrender. They also seized 10 firearms. The remaining enemy troops fled in disarray, and the patriotic military and civilians recaptured the Nam Ba and Huai Xai areas.

From November 23 to 27, the patriotic military and civilians in the northern Phou Sene Fin area of Luang Prabang Province bravely fought back against the enemy's sweeping operations, killing 75 enemy troops, wounding four, capturing nine, and seizing more than 30 weapons, completely shattering the enemy's sweeping operations.

The Pathet Lao radio station also reported that in the Chomphet District of this province, the local patriotic forces and guerrilla units have bravely fought 15 battles in the past three months, eliminating 57 enemy troops, seizing two heavy machine guns, a batch of carbines and pistols, and 200 hand grenades, and sinking one enemy ship.

In the Muan Ai District, recently, 10 enemy soldiers surrendered with their weapons to the patriotic forces.

According to a report from the Pathet Lao radio station, the Lao People's Liberation Army General Command spokesperson issued a statement on November 30, strongly protesting the U.S. imperialists and their Laotian puppets dispatching tens of battalions of troops to launch a large-scale encroaching attack on the liberated areas of Tadton District and Ban Fong Township in Saravane Province.

The spokesperson of the Lao People's Liberation Army General Command, on behalf of the command, once again warned the U.S. imperialists and their Laotian puppets: If they persist in sending mercenaries to encroach and attack the liberated areas, the Lao people and patriotic forces will resolutely give them the punishment they deserve, making them suffer even more severe defeats.

According to another report from the Pathet Lao radio station, the spokesperson of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on December 1, strongly condemning the U.S. aggressors' aircraft for dropping chemical poisons in the central region of Laos.

The statement said that on November 23, U.S. imperialism dispatched four aircraft to bomb and drop chemical poisons on villages and fields in the Mang Pone Phai area of Xam Neua Province and the Nakone area of Saravane Province. This is another new crime committed by U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Laos.
