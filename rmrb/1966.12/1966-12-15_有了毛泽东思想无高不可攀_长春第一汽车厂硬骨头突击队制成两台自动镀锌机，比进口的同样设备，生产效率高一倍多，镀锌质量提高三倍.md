With the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the "Hard-Boned" Brigade of the First Automobile Works in Changchun has, after 188 days of hard work, produced two advanced automatic galvanizing machines that are on par with the world's best. These machines have a production efficiency 1.4 times higher and a galvanizing quality three times better than the imported machines of the same type. The working conditions for the workers have also been greatly improved.

Last year, in order to significantly increase automobile production, the factory decided to manufacture two galvanizing machines based on the design of imported machines from the 1950s. However, the workers said, "We are familiar with every aspect of these old imported machines from the 1950s. We have the confidence to improve them and create new ones." The workers' bold words quickly turned into action. Seven people, including design engineer Wang Jinghua and machinist Sun Baoxing from the workshop's mobile repair team, formed a brigade specifically responsible for the design and manufacturing work. The galvanizing machine is a large piece of equipment, 15 meters long and weighing 22 tons. The workshop's mobile repair team, which usually handles equipment maintenance, faced many challenges in manufacturing such a large machine. How to proceed? Chairman Mao's teaching, "Practice while learning, and learning through practice," gave them boundless strength. Thus, they began to work, learn, and discuss simultaneously.

To create advanced equipment suitable for China's needs, they fearlessly challenged conventional wisdom and insisted on forging their own path. Despite the lack of resources, they worked tirelessly, seizing every moment. In just 97 days, they completed the design of over 5,000 parts and the drafting of 560 blueprints ahead of schedule.

When the manufacturing process began, the first challenge they encountered was the lack of a suitable workshop. Where could they find a 300-square-meter workshop? The brigade members decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and solve the problem with the spirit of Daqing. They erected a temporary shed using old wooden boards, scrap iron sheets, and tar paper next to the main workshop. Inside the shed, they hung banners with slogans such as "Break free from foreign constraints, discard foreign crutches. Dare to revolutionize, be good at innovating, and forge our own path."

They treated Chairman Mao's teachings as commands for production. No matter how cold the weather or how many difficulties they faced, they persisted in their struggle. In this way, they successfully and efficiently produced two advanced automatic galvanizing machines that are on par with the world's best.

In March of this year, the factory leadership, to encourage them to continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to forever revolutionize and advance, named this brigade the "Hard-Boned" Brigade and awarded them a collective first-class merit citation.

### 有了毛泽东思想无高不可攀  长春第一汽车厂硬骨头突击队制成两台自动镀锌机，比进口的同样设备，生产效率高一倍多，镀锌质量提高三倍

    有了毛泽东思想无高不可攀
    长春第一汽车厂硬骨头突击队制成两台自动镀锌机，比进口的同样设备，生产效率高一倍多，镀锌质量提高三倍
    据新华社长春电　长春第一汽车制造厂热处理车间硬骨头突击队在毛泽东思想指引下，奋战一百八十八天，制成了两台具有世界先进水平的钟型自动镀锌机。他们制成的镀锌机，比外国进口的同样设备，生产效率提高一点四倍，镀锌质量提高三倍；工人的劳动条件，也比过去大大改善。
    去年下半年，厂里为了大幅度提高汽车产量，决定按照从外国进口的钟型镀锌机的老样子，自制两台镀锌机。但是工人们说：“这种由外国进口的五十年代的老设备，我们对它的里里外外，已经摸熟了，有把握革它的命，造新的。”职工们的豪言壮语很快变成了实际行动。车间机动科设计员王靖华、钳工孙宝兴等七人组成了一个突击队，专门负责设计制造工作。钟型镀锌机是一种长十五米、重二十二吨的大型技术设备。车间机动科向来是管设备维护的，要制造这样大的机器，困难是很多的。怎么办呢？毛主席关于“干起来再学习，干就是学习”的教导，给了他们无穷的力量。于是，他们就边干，边学，边议论。
    为了制造出适合我国需要的先进设备，他们在设计过程中，不怕鬼、不信邪，坚决要走自己的路。他们废寝忘食，争分夺秒，在没有资料的困难情况下，只用九十七天时间，就提前完成了五千多个零件的设计和五百六十多张图纸的绘制工作。
    制造工作开始后，遇到的头一个困难就是厂房问题。哪里能有一个现成的三百平方米的厂房呢？突击队队员们决定按着毛主席的教导，用大庆的精神来解决问题。他们在大厂房旁边，用旧木板、碎铁皮和油毡纸搭起一个临时工棚。工棚里写着“打破洋框框，丢掉洋拐棍。勇于革命，善于创新，走自己的路”等大字标语。
    他们把毛主席的教导，当作指挥生产的命令。天再冷，困难再多，他们始终坚持战斗。就这样，他们终于高速度高质量地制成了两台具有世界先进水平的钟型自动镀锌机。
    今年三月，工厂领导为勉励他们进一步高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远革命，永远前进，已给这个突击队命名为“硬骨头突击队”，并且给他们记了集体特等功。
