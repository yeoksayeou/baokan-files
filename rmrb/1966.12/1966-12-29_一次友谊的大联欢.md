When the Indian aggressors invaded Pakistan in the previous year, they had built a bunker in the front lines of Lahore. The heroic military and civilian people of Pakistan united and finally drove the Indian aggressors back.

Not long ago, when the Chinese Folk Dance Troupe visited Pakistan to perform, they specially went to visit this bunker. After hearing about the heroic deeds related to this bunker, the members of the Chinese art troupe couldn't help but sing the song "Salute to the Defenders of Lahore Heroes!" Instantly, passersby all stopped and joined in, enthusiastically singing this song of praise for the people of Lahore. Then, four or five hundred people formed a large circle. The Chinese performers sang "The Voyage of the Ocean Depends on the Helmsman" and danced a battle dance. The entire scene became lively. Shouts of "Long Live Mao Zedong!" and "Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship!" echoed back and forth. Finally, the friendship gala ended with the high-spirited singing of "Unity is Strength."

    一次友谊的大联欢
    去年印度侵略者入侵巴基斯坦的时候，曾在拉合尔前沿修了一个碉堡。英雄的巴基斯坦军民，齐心协力，终于把印度侵略者打回去了。
    中国民间歌舞团不久前到巴基斯坦访问演出时，特地去参观这个碉堡。当中国艺术团团员听了有关这个碉堡的英勇事迹后，就情不自禁地唱起了《向拉合尔英雄的保卫者致敬！》的歌曲。刹那间，过往的行人都停留下来，一起激情地高唱这首拉合尔人民的赞歌。接着，四五百人围成了一个大圆圈。中国演员唱起了《大海航行靠舵手》，跳起了战斗的舞蹈。全场沸腾起来了。“毛泽东万岁！”“中巴友谊万岁！”的口号声此起彼落。最后在《团结就是力量》的高歌声中结束了这场友谊的大联欢。
