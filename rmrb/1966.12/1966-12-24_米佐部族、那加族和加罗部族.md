The Mizo tribe resides in the Mizo Hills district of Assam. For a long time, they have been oppressed by the Indian ruling class and have consistently demanded national autonomy. In March 1964, the Mizo tribe attacked several government strongholds. This year, at the end of February, about 10,000 members of the Mizo tribe launched a large-scale armed rebellion, causing significant shock to the Indian government.

The Naga tribe is a minority ethnic group living on the border between India and Burma. The Indian government has consistently refused their demand for autonomy and has implemented a brutal policy of national oppression against them. Many Naga villages have been burned down, tens of thousands of villagers have been killed or starved to death, and many have been imprisoned in concentration camps. Unable to endure any longer, the Naga people were forced to take up arms and begin their struggle against oppression in 1950.

The Garo tribe is a tribe in the Garo Hills of Assam. This mountainous region covers an area of approximately 3,150 square miles and is home to more than 200,000 people, including the Garo tribe.

    米佐部族、那加族和加罗部族
    米佐部族居住在阿萨姆邦米佐山区县，长期以来备受印度统治阶级的压迫，一直要求实行民族自治。一九六四年三月，米佐部族曾袭击了政府当局的几个据点。今年二月底，米佐部族约一万人举行了大规模的武装暴动，给了印度政府以很大的震动。
    那加族是居住在印度和缅甸边境的一个少数民族。印度政府一直拒绝它要求自治的愿望，对它实行了残酷的民族压迫政策。那加族的许多村庄被焚毁，数以万计的村民被杀害或饿死，许多人被关在集中营里。那加族人忍无可忍，于一九五○年被迫拿起武器开始进行反压迫斗争。
    加罗部族是阿萨姆邦加罗山区的一个部族。这个山区的面积约三千一百五十平方英里，包括加罗部族在内，有二十多万居民。
