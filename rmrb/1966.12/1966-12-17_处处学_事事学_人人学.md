Our study group at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation Sintering Plant has persisted in studying Chairman Mao's quotations for over a year, achieving the goal of learning every day, everywhere, everything, and everyone. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the members of our group have continuously improved their work and thoughts, becoming a model group.

Our group has three quotation boards. One is set up in the rest room, allowing comrades to study during breaks. The other two are carried with us, and wherever the group works, the boards are hung there. When encountering problems at work, we write relevant quotations on the boards, providing timely inspiration, encouragement, and the correct ideological weapons to solve problems. Once, after repairing equipment twice without success, some comrades lost heart. At that moment, the following quotation was hung at the repair site: "We must recognize difficulties, analyze difficulties, and struggle against difficulties." This quotation boosted everyone's confidence to overcome difficulties. We immediately analyzed and studied the issue, found the problem, and after repairing the equipment for the third time, finally fixed it, meeting the standard for a model equipment. Comrades said, "The quotation board is always in sight, Chairman Mao's teachings are before our eyes, guiding our actions."

Studying quotations can be done flexibly using every bit of time and various opportunities. In the production site, we study during work breaks; in the rest room, we study during rest times; before and after meetings, we study. While reading newspapers, we learn a quotation to understand the situation with Mao Zedong Thought; before small group life meetings, we study quotations to reflect on our own thoughts and work with Chairman Mao's words; during summaries and evaluations, we use Chairman Mao's words to judge right and wrong, good and bad. We can study collectively, discussing together, or individually, looking and thinking whenever there's time. This way, studying quotations permeates every aspect of the group's activities.

Our group starts from solving real problems, continuously studying and using quotations. Comrades have learned many quotations based on their different problems. Through persistent study over the years, accumulating day by day, repeatedly studying and using them, fundamental viewpoints such as serving the people, class struggle, daring to struggle and daring to win, have gradually taken root in our minds, significantly improving our understanding.

    处处学　事事学　人人学
    武钢烧结厂工人学习小组
    我们小组一年多来坚持学习毛主席语录，做到天天学，处处学，事事学，人人学。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，小组同志的工作和思想不断进步，成为五好小组。
    我们小组有三块语录板，一块设在休息室，同志们休息时可以学。两块随身带，小组在那里干活，就挂在那里。工作上遇到了问题，语录板上就写出语录，使大家及时得到启发，得到鼓舞，得到正确解决问题的思想武器。有一次，检修设备一连修了两次都没有修好，有的同志泄气了。这时，检修现场上挂出了这样的语录：“我们要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。”这条语录鼓起了大家战胜困难的信心，大家马上分析研究，找出毛病，再修第三次，终于修好了这台设备，达到了五好设备的标准。同志们说：“语录板，抬头见，毛主席的教导在眼前，行动有指南。”
    学语录，可以利用点滴时间和各种场合，灵活地进行学习。在生产现场利用工作间隙学，在休息室利用休息时间学，开会利用会前会后学。读报时学一条语录，用毛泽东思想认清形势；开小组生活会前学语录，用毛主席的话对照自己的思想和工作；总结评比时学语录，用毛主席的话来鉴别是非好坏。既可以集体学，大家议；也可以自己学，有空就看一看，想一想。这样，学语录渗透到小组活动的各个方面。
    我们小组从解决现实问题出发，不断学语录，用语录。同志们根据各自不同的问题，学习了不少语录。由于长年坚持，日积月累，反复学，反复用，对一些根本观点，如：为人民服务的观点，阶级斗争的观点，敢于斗争敢于胜利的观点等等，逐渐在脑子里扎下了根，认识上有了很大提高。
