Tokyo, Dec. 16 (Xinhua) - The broad masses of the Japanese people, with boundless respect for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, are enthusiastically purchasing the revolutionary classic "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong."

The red-covered "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," published by the Chinese Bookstore in Tokyo, was first sold in Nagoya on November 20 and has since been on sale in bookstores in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, and other cities, receiving enthusiastic welcome from people in various places.

In Nagoya, where "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" was first sold, buyers have been coming in an unbroken stream from morning to night. Among them are workers, peasants, shop assistants, students, women; there are old people and young people as well. When they buy this long-awaited revolutionary classic, they are all very happy.

A construction worker from the Chita Peninsula said, "A long time ago, I read Chairman Mao's 'On Practice' and 'On Contradiction.' My colleagues around me also love Chairman Mao's works. I will show this 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong' that I have bought to them."

A young woman in Nagoya, after buying "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," excitedly said, "Although some people oppose Marxism and are afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, preventing us from reading 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong,' I believe that Mao Zedong Thought is the true Marxism-Leninism." A few days later, she came back with her friends to buy "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong."

A university student bought seven copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and excitedly said, "In the past, our study group only had one copy of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong,' and everyone wanted to study it. This time, we can have one copy each." A junior high school student, after buying "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," said, "To truly understand China's revolution today, one must read 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong' well."

In remote areas such as Hokkaido, where "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" is not yet available, people are writing to bookstores in Tokyo and Nagoya, requesting mail orders.

According to a responsible person from a bookstore in Tokyo, in just twenty days, four bookstores in Tokyo sold more than 40,000 copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong."

The enthusiastic reception of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" is unparalleled by any other book published in Japan so far.

After "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" was published in Japan, the enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works among the broad masses has further surged. Study groups and small groups for studying Chairman Mao's works have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain in various places.

"Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" has immediately become a powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary masses in Japan to oppose U.S. imperialism, Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism. A young man in Kyoto, who is currently fighting against elements that sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship, said, "Chairman Mao's words are all truths." He also said, "After reading 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong,' my courage, confidence, and strength in the struggle have been enhanced. In the future, I will further combine study with struggle, truly achieve learning and applying, and advance under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought."

Ten days ago, some Japanese friends and overseas Chinese from bookstores, at a banquet celebrating the sale of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" exceeding 30,000 copies, read aloud in front of Chairman Mao's portrait a passage from "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong": "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." They unanimously expressed their determination to continue to smash the enemy's sabotage and obstacles, overcome all difficulties, persist in supplying Chairman Mao's works and revolutionary books, spread Mao Zedong Thought, and expose the various new and old followers of Soviet modern revisionism, who betray the interests of the Japanese people and oppose Sino-Japanese friendship, in the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Japanese people have an infinite love for Chairman Mao's works. At the China Economic and Trade Exhibition held in Nagoya, people from various parts of Japan rushed to buy "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." (Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter)

    日本人民欢欣鼓舞争购《毛主席语录》
    广大群众学习毛主席著作的热潮进一步高涨，学习会雨后春笋般出现
    新华社十六日讯　东京消息：日本广大人民群众怀着对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想无限崇敬的心情，欢欣鼓舞地购买革命宝书《毛主席语录》。
    东京的中华书店出版的红色封皮的《毛主席语录》，从上月二十日首先在名古屋出售，最近又在东京、大阪、京都、神户等地书店陆续出售，受到各地人民极其热烈的欢迎。
    在名古屋出售《毛主席语录》的地方，购买的人从早到晚，络绎不绝。其中有工人、农民、店员、学生、妇女；有老人，也有少年。当他们买这本盼望已久的革命宝书时，都非常高兴。
    一位来自知多半岛的建筑工人说：“很久以前，我就读了毛主席的《实践论》和《矛盾论》。我周围的伙伴也都喜爱毛主席著作。我要把这次买到的《毛主席语录》给他们看。”
    名古屋的一位女青年买到《毛主席语录》后，激动地说：“虽然有人反对马克思主义、害怕毛泽东思想，不让我们读《毛主席语录》，但是我却相信毛泽东思想是真正的马克思列宁主义。”过了几天，她又带着自己的朋友来买《毛主席语录》。
    一位大学生买了七本《毛主席语录》，他兴奋地说：“过去我们的研究小组只有一本《毛主席语录》，大家都要求学习。这回，我们就可以做到人手一册了。”一个初中学生买到《毛主席语录》后说：“要想真心地了解中国今天的革命，就必须好好读《毛主席语录》。”
    在北海道等边远地区一时在当地还买不到《毛主席语录》的群众，纷纷给东京和名古屋的书店写信，要求邮购。
    据东京一家书店的负责人说，二十天内，东京的四家书店就卖出四万多册《毛主席语录》。
    《毛主席语录》受读者欢迎的盛况，是至今日本出版的任何一种书都远远不能相比的。
    《毛主席语录》在日本出版以后，广大群众学习毛主席著作的热潮进一步高涨。毛主席著作学习会、学习小组，像雨后春笋般地在各地出现。
    《毛主席语录》到了日本革命群众手里，立即成为他们反对美帝国主义、日本反动派和现代修正主义的强大思想武器。京都的一位正在同破坏日中友好的分子进行斗争的青年说：“毛主席的话句句是真理。”他还说：“读了《毛主席语录》，提高了我的斗争勇气、信心和力量。今后，我要进一步结合斗争学习，真正做到活学活用，在毛泽东思想的指导下前进。”
    十天前，一些书店的日本朋友和华侨，在庆祝出售《毛主席语录》突破三万册的酒会上，在毛主席像前，大声朗读《毛主席语录》中的一段话：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”他们一致表示要继续粉碎敌人的破坏和障碍，克服一切困难，坚持供应毛主席著作和革命书籍，传播毛泽东思想，使叛卖日本人民利益、反对日中友好的苏联现代修正主义的形形色色的新旧追随者在毛泽东思想的照妖镜下现出原形。（附图片）
