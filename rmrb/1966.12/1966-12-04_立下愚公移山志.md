    With "The Three Constantly Read Articles" in his pocket and a red sun in his heart, he has resolved to move mountains like the Foolish Old Man. He dares to brave knife mountains and fire seas. For the revolution, he rushes to the battlefield, determined to tame the waves of the Haihe River. Holding high the red book, he watches his actions; with a shovel, a pickaxe, and a cart, he is busy. On the construction site, battle songs resound, Chairman Mao's thoughts shine with golden light, and the heroic troops on the construction site display their prowess. This winter, they will definitely fight a brilliant battle!

    立下愚公移山志
    王戍忠“老三篇”身上装，胸中有个红太阳。立下愚公移山志，刀山火海咱敢闯。为革命“赶战场”，定要驯服海河浪。红书高举看行动；挥锨抡镐拉车忙。工地上，战歌响，主席思想闪金光，工地雄师逞英豪；今冬再打漂亮仗！
