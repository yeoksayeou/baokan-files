Workers at the Yumen Oil Field, under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have taken the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key link, combining revolution with production. As a result, the entire oil field's crude oil production plan has been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, with a significant reduction in production costs.

Yumen Oil Field is one of China's oldest oil bases. This year, the workers have resolutely implemented the five principles of emphasizing politics proposed by Comrade Lin Biao. They have placed a strong emphasis on politics, taking the People's Liberation Army as their example, and have been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, especially since October. The workers have responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study the "Three Articles" as their guiding principles, greatly promoting the ideological revolution of the workers and the revolutionization of the enterprise.

In recent years, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the workers of Yumen Oil Field have conducted a series of scientific experiments and adjustments for the late-stage development of the oil field, gradually improving the oil field's conditions and restoring the old oil field's vitality.

This year, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," the workers have further adjusted the oil field. They have displayed a spirit of tackling the hardest problems, focusing on low-yield oil layers. The entire oil field has launched a mass movement to analyze oil wells, basically understanding the distribution patterns of each oil layer and identifying the main contradictions in the late-stage development of the oil field. The workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings on focusing on the main contradictions and concentrating forces to win decisive battles, have conducted two major oil field development campaigns targeting different oil layers. This has led to a new situation where production, pressure, and water content are all stable. The workers have fought this battle of oil field development as a political and moral struggle, as a battle against imperialism, revisionism, and all monsters and demons, achieving brilliant results. The daily crude oil production in the Shiyougou area has increased by 47% compared to the past, reaching the highest level in recent years.

This year, the workers have broken free from foreign frameworks, carried out technological innovations and revolutions, and gradually established a set of oil extraction techniques suitable for the late-stage development of the oil field. They have developed many new tools, equipment, and technologies for the late-stage development of oil fields, contributing to the late-stage development of China's oil fields.

The revolutionary workers of the Lanzhou Refinery, under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have completed the annual production plan for the main products one month ahead of schedule. This is the workers of the alkylation workshop maintaining and repairing equipment and pipelines after completing the annual plan ahead of schedule, preparing for the new production tasks of the coming year.

    职工思想革命化促进企业革命化
    玉门原油生产计划提前超额完成
    据新华社兰州十三日电　玉门油矿广大职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，以文化大革命为纲，抓革命，促生产，全矿的原油生产计划已经提前超额完成，原油生产成本也有显著降低。
    玉门油矿是我国的一个老石油基地。今年以来，这个油矿的广大职工，坚决贯彻执行了林彪同志提出的突出政治的五项原则，大力突出政治，以解放军为榜样，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中坚持活学活用毛主席著作，特别是十月份以来，职工们响应林彪同志的号召，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，大大促进了职工的思想革命化和企业革命化。
    近几年来，玉门油矿职工，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，针对老油田的特点，进行了一系列油田后期采油的科学试验和调整工作，使油田面貌逐步改观，使已经转入后期采油的老油矿恢复了青春的活力。
    今年以来，职工们根据毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”的指示，进一步对油田进行了调整。他们发扬啃硬骨头的精神，重点向低产量的油层进攻。全矿开展了群众性的油井分析活动，基本上搞清了各个油层的分布规律，找到了油田后期开发的主要矛盾。职工们遵照毛主席关于抓主要矛盾，集中力量打歼灭战的教导，针对油层之间的差异，开展了分层注水、分层采油和攻坚啃硬的两次油田开发大会战，从而使油田出现了产量、压力、含水三稳定的新局面。广大职工把这场油田开发上的攻坚战，当成政治仗和志气仗来打，当成反帝、反修和反击一切牛鬼蛇神的仗来打，取得了辉煌的战果。石油沟地区原油日产量比过去增长了百分之四十七，创造了近几年的最高水平。
    今年以来，职工们大破洋框框，大搞技术革新和技术革命，逐步建立了一套适应油田后期开发的采油工艺，搞出了许多油田后期开发方面的新工具、新设备、新技术，为我国油田的后期开发作出了贡献。（附图片）
