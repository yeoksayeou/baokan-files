The Zhangjiawuzi Production Brigade of the Mayangshan People's Commune in Yinchuan County, Ningxia, has hung a board with Chairman Mao's quotations at the door of each household. The quotations on the boards are tailored to the thoughts and concerns of the commune members. These quotation boards were initiated by the brigade's study group for Chairman Mao's works.

Previously, the brigade members had requested that the herdsmen, while herding, fill in the holes left from digging for ground squirrels and licorice, and sow grass seeds in the filled holes. However, during a certain period, the herdsmen did not perform this task well. The study group discovered that the main issue was that some herdsmen were afraid of the difficulties involved. Therefore, they studied Chairman Mao's quotation with herdsman Sun Deyi: "Resolutely take the road of socialism, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They also helped Sun Deyi write this quotation on the board at his door. Sun Deyi kept this quotation in mind and carried a shovel and a bag of grass seeds while herding, filling in holes and sowing grass seeds along the way. Inspired by his actions, the other two herdsmen also took action.

Production team leader Sun Dechuan used to often delay hitching the plow and unharness it early, and he would also choose the better plows and seeders, which caused discontent among the commune members. After learning about this situation, the study group studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with him. Chairman Mao said: "Many people are irresponsible in their work, shirking heavy tasks and pushing them onto others, taking on light tasks themselves. When faced with a task, they first think of themselves and then of others.... Such people are not real communists, at least not pure communists." After studying this together, they wrote this quotation on the quotation board. Sun Dechuan said, "Chairman Mao is talking about me. I must change." From then on, he often went to the fields early, worked with great enthusiasm, and let others use the better farming tools.

    把条条语录记在心上
    宁夏盐池县麻黄山公社张家洼子大队卧风掌生产队，每户社员的家门口都挂着一个毛主席语录牌。牌上的语录，都是针对社员的活思想写的。这些语录牌，是这个生产队学习毛主席著作小组办起来的。
    过去，这个队的社员曾要求放牧员结合放牧，把挖黄鼠和挖甘草时留下的坑填好，再顺手补种上牧草。可是，有一个时期，放牧员没有很好去做。学习毛主席著作小组一了解，主要是一些放牧员怕困难。于是，他们就和放牧员孙得义一起，学习了毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”同时，他们还帮助孙得义把这条语录写在他门前的语录牌上。孙得义把这条语录看在眼里，记在心上，每天放牧带上一把锹，背上一口袋草籽，边放牧边填坑、边种牧草。在他的带动下，其他两个放牧员也行动起来了。
    生产组长孙德川，过去经常套犁迟、卸得早，还拣好犁，挑好耧，社员很有意见。学习毛主席著作小组知道这一情况后，就和他一起学习《纪念白求恩》。毛主席说：“不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。……这种人其实不是共产党员，至少不能算一个纯粹的共产党员。”他们一起学习后，就把这条语录写在语录牌上。孙德川说：“毛主席这是在说我呢，我一定改正。”从这以后，他经常早早地下地，干劲很大，还把好农具让给别人。
