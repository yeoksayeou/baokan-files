The Soviet revisionist leadership clique and its followers have been escalating their anti-China farce, recently even stirring up a black wind to expel Chinese students. The Soviet authorities issued an unreasonable order in October for all Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union to leave and return to China. Subsequently, the Hungarian authorities, following the Soviets, expelled five Chinese students studying in Hungary from their schools.

The Soviet and Hungarian authorities have long been terrified of Chinese students, constantly imposing various unreasonable restrictions on their activities. Before the Chinese students were forced to leave the Soviet Union, they went to bid farewell to the great leader of the world proletariat, Lenin's remains, and Stalin's tomb. The Soviet authorities, as if facing a major threat, mobilized a large number of police to seal off the entrances to Red Square. Their fear and timidity are truly laughable.

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is not only afraid of Chinese students but also of Chinese delegations visiting the Soviet Union. In September and October of this year, a Chinese delegation visited the Soviet Union. The Soviet side deliberately arranged for this delegation to go out for tours at night to prevent Soviet people from contacting the delegation. Once, this delegation visited a factory. Upon entering, they saw no Soviet workers. It turned out that the Soviet authorities had previously driven all the workers to one workshop. Later, the Soviet workers discovered that the visitors were Chinese comrades and, disregarding the surveillance, enthusiastically rushed over, surrounding the Chinese comrades. Some shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" while others asked the delegation for Mao Zedong badges. Our delegation saw a photograph of the visitors in the factory office, labeled "Japanese Delegation." Upon closer inspection, they found familiar Chinese comrades in the photograph and lodged a protest with the Soviet side. Look, the Soviet authorities are so terrified of even photographs of Chinese people!

Why are the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and its followers so afraid of Chinese students and Chinese delegations?

Chairman Mao pointed out: All reactionaries are paper tigers. The U.S. imperialists are paper tigers, and the Soviet revisionists are also paper tigers. After seizing power, the Soviet revisionist clique has been implementing fascist terror rule at home, carrying out mad persecution against revolutionary people. On the surface, the Soviet leadership seems formidable and invincible, but in reality, they do not have the support of the people at home and are very weak, just like sitting on a volcano.

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique and its followers are extremely afraid of the great Mao Zedong Thought. They know that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon to defeat modern revisionism. Therefore, they are deeply afraid that the people at home will come into contact with and grasp Mao Zedong Thought, rising up to fight against them. Especially since China, under the personal initiation and leadership of Chairman Mao, is carrying out an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, which has sounded the death knell for all revisionists worldwide. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique and its followers are even more afraid that the people at home will understand the truth about China's cultural revolution and that young people will learn from the example of the Chinese Red Guards, rising up to sweep away all monsters and demons, and to rebel against revisionism. Therefore, although Chinese students and Chinese delegations are unarmed, they are seen as extremely dangerous by the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and its followers, who isolate them from the people at home and even order them to leave the country. They think that by doing so, they can block the spread of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Soviet leadership clique and its followers' plan is nothing but a wild dream. Everyone knows that truth cannot be suppressed by any force. The great Mao Zedong Thought spreading throughout the world is an irresistible historical trend. The situation described by the Chinese students returning from the Soviet Union shows that, no matter how the Soviet revisionist leadership clique blocks and suppresses the Soviet people and attacks and slanders China, our great leader Chairman Mao is still deeply loved by the broad masses of the Soviet people, and the great Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly taking root in the hearts of the Soviet people. The situation in Hungary is the same. History will develop in the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, just like a train running along the tracks towards the future. The Soviet revisionist clique and its followers, attempting to use anti-China sentiments to block the progress of history, are like a few toads crawling on the tracks, screaming, and will ultimately be crushed into powder by the wheels of history.

### 真理是封锁不住的

    真理是封锁不住的
    苏联修正主义领导集团及其追随者，反华丑剧越演越凶，最近还刮起赶走我国留学生的黑风。苏联当局在十月份无理勒令我国留苏学生全部离苏返国。接着，匈牙利当局追随苏修把我国五位留匈学生无理赶出了校门。
    苏联当局和匈牙利当局早就对中国留学生怕得要死，一直对中国留学生的行动进行种种无理的限制。当我国留苏学生被迫离开苏联之前，向世界无产阶级的伟大领袖列宁遗体和斯大林墓告别，苏联当局如临大敌，竟调动大批警察，封锁红场入口。心虚胆怯，实在令人可笑。
    苏修领导集团不但怕中国留学生，也怕去苏联访问的中国代表团。今年九、十月间，我们有一个代表团到苏联去访问。苏方故意安排这个代表团在夜里出外参观，防止苏联人民同代表团接触。有一次，这个代表团到一个工厂参观，进厂时看不到一个苏联工人。原来，苏方当局事先把工人都赶到一个车间去了。后来，苏联工人发现来访者是中国同志，就不顾那些监视者的拦阻，热情地涌上来，围住中国同志。有的高呼“毛泽东万岁！”有的向代表团要毛主席像纪念章。我们的代表团看到工厂办公室里挂着一张参观者的照片，上面写着“日本代表团”字样。凑近仔细一看，发现照片上有自己熟悉的中国同志，就向苏方提出了抗议。看，苏联当局连中国人的照片都怕到这种地步！
    苏修领导集团及其追随者为什么这样害怕中国留学生和中国代表团呢？
    毛主席指出：一切反动派都是纸老虎。美帝国主义是纸老虎，苏联修正主义也是纸老虎。苏联修正主义集团及其追随者篡夺了领导权以后，在国内实行法西斯恐怖统治，对革命人民进行疯狂的迫害。从表面上看，苏联领导集团似乎威风凛凛，不可一世，实际上，他们完全得不到国内人民的支持，地位虚弱得很，正像坐在火山口上一样。
    苏修领导集团及其追随者极端害怕伟大的毛泽东思想。他们知道，毛泽东思想是战胜现代修正主义的强大武器。因此，他们深恐国内人民接触和掌握毛泽东思想，起来同他们进行斗争。特别是中国在毛主席亲自发动和领导下正在进行一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，给全世界的修正主义者敲响了丧钟。苏修领导集团及其追随者就更加害怕国内人民了解中国文化大革命的真相，害怕青少年学习中国红卫兵的榜样，起来横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，大造修正主义的反。因此，中国留学生和中国代表团虽然手无寸铁，但是在苏修领导集团及其追随者看来却是危险万分，把他们同国内人民隔绝，甚至勒令非离境不可。他们认为，这样做，就可以阻挠毛泽东思想传播了。
    苏联领导集团及其追随者的这种打算，不过是痴心妄想。谁都知道，真理是任何力量都封锁不住的。伟大的毛泽东思想在全世界的传播，是不可抗拒的历史潮流。中国留苏学生回国后所谈到的情况表明，不管苏修领导集团对苏联人民怎样进行封锁和压制，对中国怎样进行攻击和诬蔑，我们的伟大领袖毛主席仍然受到广大苏联人民的无限热爱，伟大的毛泽东思想在苏联越来越深入人心。在匈牙利，情况也是一样。历史必将按着毛主席指出的方向发展，正像列车沿着铁轨隆隆奔向前方一样。苏联修正主义集团及其追随者，妄想用反华来阻挡历史的前进，不过像几只癞蛤蟆爬在铁轨上乱叫，最后一定要被历史的车轮压得粉碎。
