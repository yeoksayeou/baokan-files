Chairman Mao said, "A change in worldview is a fundamental change." The comrades of a motor transport company in a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region have deeply felt the truth of this statement through their revolutionary practice. Previously, they did not grasp the fundamental issue of worldview reform and, despite investing considerable effort, found that the problems within the company were still not effectively resolved. Later, after analyzing and studying the issue, they identified the key problem and guided everyone to consciously reform their worldview. As a result, the company's ideological landscape underwent a significant transformation, and some long-standing "difficult problems" were resolved.

Worldview is a comprehensive summary of one's stance, perspective, and methods. People's thoughts vary greatly and manifest in diverse ways, but ultimately, they are all connected to and determined by a particular worldview. One either stands on the proletarian stance and uses proletarian perspectives to view everything, or stands on the bourgeois stance and uses bourgeois perspectives to view everything; one either acts for the public good or for personal gain. To reform one's thoughts, one must elevate each specific issue to the level of worldview for recognition and analysis. One must grasp the core issue of breaking away from personal interests and establishing public interests in the reform of worldview, and use Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly eliminate bourgeois ideology. If one does not address this fundamental issue and instead deals with each matter individually, focusing only on minor problems, one will, as the comrades of the motor transport company put it, "suppress one problem only to see another emerge."

Worldview is manifested through one's words and deeds. There is no clever way to reform one's worldview; one must, in revolutionary struggle and in daily work and life, use the "Three Articles" as a mirror, frequently examine one's words and deeds, and honestly reform oneself bit by bit. If one only talks about reforming but does not put in the effort in action, fearing pain and discomfort, such reform is merely empty talk.

Thought reform must start from the fundamentals and begin with small steps. The experience of the motor transport company is not only helpful for comrades doing grassroots work but also provides inspiration for each of us.

    从根本着眼，从点滴入手
    立影
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。广州部队某部汽车运输连的同志，经过自己的革命实践，对这条真理有了深切的体会。以前，他们没有抓住世界观改造这个根本，花了不少力气，连队的问题仍然解决得不好；后来，他们经过分析研究，找到了问题的关键，引导大家自觉地改造世界观，连队的思想面貌就有了显著的变化，一些“老大难”的问题也得到了解决。
    世界观是人们的立场、观点、方法的总概括。人们的思想千差万别，表现各种各样，但是，归根到底，总是和一种世界观联系着，被一种世界观决定着。不是站在无产阶级立场上，用无产阶级观点来看待一切，就是站在资产阶级立场上，用资产阶级观点看待一切；不是为“公”，就是为“私”。改造思想，就要把一个一个的具体问题，提到世界观的高度来认识和分析，就要抓住破“私”立“公”这个改造世界观的核心问题，就要用毛泽东思想，彻底破除资产阶级思想。不从这个根本问题着眼，就事论事，光在一些枝节问题上打圈子，就会像汽车连的同志形容的那样：“按下葫芦浮起瓢”。
    世界观是通过人们的一言一行体现出来的。改造世界观，没有什么巧妙的办法，只有在革命斗争中，在日常的工作、生活中，以“老三篇”作镜子，经常检查自己的言行，一点一滴地、老老实实地进行改造。嘴里喊着要改造，行动上又不肯下功夫，怕痛怕痒，这样的改造不过是一句空话。
    思想改造要从根本着眼，从点滴入手。汽车连的经验，不仅对一些做基层工作的同志有帮助，对我们每个同志都有启发。
