	China has successfully conducted three nuclear tests this year, which makes us very happy. This signifies that China's science and technology have reached a new level. This is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people who are fighting against American aggression for national salvation and to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are bravely fighting for national liberation. It is a great contribution to the defense of world peace.

Please also convey our heartfelt congratulations to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the workers, the engineering and technical personnel, and the scientific workers.

	Wishing you good health.
