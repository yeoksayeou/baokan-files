The Albanian "Warrior" newspaper published an article on December 4 introducing the heroic deeds of Cai Yongxiang, who sacrificed himself to rescue a Red Guard special train, and praised him as a good warrior of Chairman Mao. The article emphasized that only those nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought can be loyal to the motherland and the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 4: The Albanian People's Army organ "Warrior" published an editorial on December 4, warmly praising Cai Yongxiang, who sacrificed himself to rescue a Red Guard special train and dedicated himself to the public, as a communist warrior. The newspaper also published his photograph.

After introducing Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds, the article pointed out that Cai Yongxiang is another shining example following Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ou Yanghai, and Liu Yingjun. He has a high level of political awareness and believes that he is undertaking a great mission more precious than life itself. He sacrificed his life for the sake of thousands of people.

The article said that dying for a just and sacred cause, for the people and the motherland, is a glorious deed that will be remembered forever. The people for whom he dedicated his life will forever respect and remember him. Only those nurtured by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can achieve such feats of loyalty to their class, to the people and the motherland, and such courage and fearlessness.

The article said that Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds will forever inspire the younger generation in China to love the Communist Party of China, their leader Chairman Mao Zedong, their socialist motherland, and their faithful defenders—the People's Liberation Army.

The article said that as comrades-in-arms and fellow soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, our armed forces highly evaluate the heroic example set by their comrade. In the liberation war and after liberation, our army also produced unyielding and brave warriors like Hekuran Zenuni and Seferdin Selami, who completed glorious missions with rare selflessness, just like the heroic deeds of Comrade Cai Yongxiang, which earned them the respect of the people.

The article concluded by saying that while learning from these heroic examples, we will strive to further strengthen and consolidate the combat friendship and unity between the brotherly peoples and brotherly armies under the leadership of the two Marxist-Leninist parties. In our two countries' armies, there will emerge many more figures like Cai Yongxiang and Hekuran Zenuni, who are fearless in the face of difficulties and sacrifices, and are willing to dedicate their lives to the cause of socialism and the people without hesitation. They are invincible.

    新华社地拉那四日电  阿尔巴尼亚人民军机关报《战士报》四日发表编辑部文章，热烈赞扬舍身抢救红卫兵专车、一心为公的共产主义战士蔡永祥，并刊登了他的照片。
    文章在介绍了蔡永祥的英雄事迹后指出，蔡永祥是继雷锋、王杰、欧阳海和刘英俊之后的又一个光辉典范。他有着高度的政治觉悟，相信自己是去完成一件比生命还宝贵的伟大任务，他为千百万人献出了自己的生命。
    文章说，像蔡永祥一样为正义的、神圣的事业而死，为人民和祖国的利益而死，是流芳千古的业绩。他为之献身的人民将永远尊敬他和怀念他。只有用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想培养出来的人，才能完成这样忠于本阶级、忠于人民和祖国，这样勇敢和大无畏的业绩。
    文章说，蔡永祥的英雄行为将永远激励中国的年青一代对中国共产党，对他们的领袖毛泽东同志，对社会主义祖国，对他们的忠实保卫者——人民解放军更加热爱。
    文章说，作为中国人民解放军的战友和同志，我国武装部队高度评价自己战友的英雄榜样。在解放战争中，在解放后，我们的军队也出现了像海库拉恩·泽努尼，塞费丁·塞拉米等不屈不挠的英勇战士，他们以罕见的忘我精神完成了光荣的任务，像蔡永祥同志的英雄行为一样得到人民的尊敬。
    文章最后说，我们在学习这些英雄的光辉榜样的时候，将为进一步加强和巩固我们两个马克思列宁主义党领导下的兄弟人民和兄弟军队之间的战斗友谊和团结而斗争。在我们两国的军队中还将产生许多不怕困难、不怕牺牲、为社会主义和人民的事业而毫不犹豫地献出生命的蔡永祥和海库拉恩·泽努尼式的人物，他们都是不可战胜的。
