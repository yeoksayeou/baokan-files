To achieve the ideological transformation of people, one can accomplish various tasks more, faster, better, and more economically. The boiler workers at the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army have earnestly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, modified the boilers three times, and saved a large amount of coal for the country. Their brilliant deeds fully illustrate this unshakable truth.

Transforming old things and creating new things is not an easy task. One must be prepared to take a winding road and overcome numerous difficulties and obstacles. This especially requires the establishment of a great ambition and spirit of the proletariat, possessing the daring to think, do, and venture. The boiler workers at the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army used Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls, establishing the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly. Therefore, they dared to lead the way, overcome all difficulties, and achieve the goal of conquering and transforming nature.

Under the leadership of the Logistics Department Party Committee and the hospital party committee, the boiler room comrades at the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army have, since 1964, broken free from the constraints of old frameworks and foreign dogmas. They have modified the boilers three times in three years, achieving the outstanding results of one boiler performing the work of three and burning two years' worth of coal in one year.

The boiler workers used revolutionary actions to deeply expose and criticize the ideas of seeing only objects, adhering to old ways, and doing nothing. They eloquently proved that workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the most creative spirit.

Two kinds of thoughts, two kinds of conclusions

Chairman Mao said: Many things, if we fall into blind obedience and lack self-awareness, can become our burdens and obstacles.

The General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army originally had only one boiler room with three boilers. Later, the number gradually increased to twenty-one boilers, consuming a significant amount of coal each year.

The hospital requires hot water and steam year-round, and it cannot be interrupted at any time. In the past, because people did not see the active role of humans, they reached such a conclusion: "Boiling the boiler is only passively meeting the needs of medical treatment. The ward needs disinfection, so we supply gas; the ward is cold, so we add coal. We cannot control our own fate." Due to this passive attitude, people became slaves to the boilers, not only failing to save coal but also increasing coal consumption year by year, and the heating costs exceeded the budget every year.

For a long time, there was a saying: "The hospital is large, the boilers are many, the requirements are high, and it is difficult to save coal." They invited technical personnel to inspect the equipment and calculate the data, concluding that everything was normal and no coal-saving potential was found. They also consulted engineers and experts, who said that according to the needs, two more boilers were required.

In 1964, the Central Committee issued directives on saving coal, and the hospital party committee immediately organized everyone to study them. At this time, the workers thought: Others can save coal to support national construction, but we are competing with industry for "grain," which made them feel uneasy. Therefore, the party branch organized some comrades to visit and learn from others' methods of recycling boiler slag, starting trials on low-pressure boilers. However, several attempts failed. Some comrades said: "How much oil can be extracted from the slag? This is like blowing out a lamp with a split lip—it's all in vain!"

The party branch of the barracks department believed that whether or not to burn slag reflected the struggle between two kinds of thoughts: daring to revolutionize or not. They mobilized all the department's cadres to go deep into the boiler room, work with the workers, and conduct trials and discussions together. Worker team leader Wu Yinshuang said: "Why does the steam pressure from one boiler vary in different places? That's because there are leaks in the pipes; why can others burn slag but we can't? That's because there are leaks in our thoughts." Everyone expressed their determination to move mountains with the spirit of Yu Gong, overcome this difficulty. Thus, they continued the experiments. Ten boilers competed with each other, summarizing experiences as they went, gradually mastering the laws, and burning coal and slag in equal proportions to meet the heating requirements.

Subsequently, they used the experience of reducing the furnace area from a sister unit, reducing the daily coal consumption of ten low-pressure boilers from twenty-two tons to twelve tons, opening the first breakthrough in saving coal.

The appearance of this breakthrough educated the leaders and all the boiler room workers, breaking the old framework of "the hospital is large, the boilers are many, the requirements are high, and it is difficult to save coal."

In 1965, the hospital party committee required them to make further efforts to catch up with and surpass the most advanced coal-saving level in Beijing.

The comrades in the boiler room accepted this task with full confidence, determined to stage a complete comeback. However, to achieve the new requirements, what should they rely on?

Chairman Mao said: Grasping ideological education is the key link in uniting the entire party to wage a great political struggle. If this task is not solved, the party's political tasks cannot be completed.

At this time, the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao issued directives on emphasizing politics. The party branch of the barracks department immediately organized all department members to study these directives. Combining the summary of past work, they extensively discussed the sweetness of emphasizing politics and the bitterness of not emphasizing politics. Through study, everyone realized that the potential for saving coal is limitless, the key lies in the ideological transformation of people, relying on emphasizing politics, and relying on Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead.

The workers actively responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, quickly forming a trend of voluntarily reading Chairman Mao's works every day in the entire class. The thought of "boiling the boiler for the revolution" took root in their minds.

At this time, the hospital organized a short-term training class to study Chairman Mao's four philosophical works. The party branch of the barracks department believed that the boiler room's tasks were heavy and the work was busy, so they needed to study Chairman Mao's works even more. Therefore, they sent several team leaders and key members to participate. Boiler worker Li Wenyuan previously thought that the workload was heavy and manpower was insufficient, and this contradiction could not be solved. After reading "On Contradiction," he understood that people are the decisive factor. By mobilizing the masses' strength, focusing on the main issues, and concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles, even with few people, big things can be done. Zhang Zongxue, after studying "Practice," said: "Chairman Mao said that all knowledge comes from practice. As long as we dare to lead the way, learn as we do, and master objective laws, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome." The workers all said: "Those who have participated in the training have changed a lot, they stand higher and see farther than us." More and more people in the class are studying. They said: "As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, no matter how great the difficulty, we will trample it underfoot."

Chairman Mao said: The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and working intellectuals. As long as these people grasp their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, not avoiding problems but solving them with an active attitude, any human difficulty can be overcome.

Chairman Mao's works elevated the workers' thoughts to a new level. Everyone dared to imagine what others had not done before, beginning to make a revolution on the foreign boilers.

The Lancashire-style high-pressure boilers, manufactured and used for over three hundred years, have rarely been modified. Now, our firemen, guided by Chairman Mao's teachings, conducted investigations and measurements, discovering that the rear flue had a temperature of 260 degrees, with a large amount of heat escaping from the chimney. Calculating the waste over three hundred years, how much coal it had wasted, and how much sweat of the working people it had squandered. Thinking this way, every comrade hated the foreign frameworks. As Chairman Mao said: "The autocrats benefit from the people's ignorance, while we benefit from the people's wisdom..." The bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" put on a "scientific" face to intimidate people, making workers their eternal slaves. Today, workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought will be the masters of the boilers!

At this time, the superior barracks department sent cadres to stay and work with the workers, studying and planning to utilize the residual heat in the flue to produce hot water, proposing to add pipes in the rear flue. Assistant clerk Yu Yongshan, based on this principle, suggested adding pipes in the furnace to obtain more hot water. However, adding pipes was equivalent to adding another boiler inside the furnace. Such a large project had never been done before. There were no materials or drawings. However, the workers all had a revolutionary spirit to save coal, and each person had a design prototype in their minds. Everyone believed: They could definitely overcome any difficulty.

This reform plan, the earlier it was implemented, the more coal it could save for the country. They decided to immediately start the modification under high temperatures. Thus, a tense "coal seizure at the fire mouth" battle began.

Chairman Mao said: Resolve to make sacrifices, fear no difficulty, and strive for victory.

This was a battle of will, wisdom, and strength.

The first battle was to install pipes in the flue. The flue was a sealed passage behind the boiler, with only a ventilation hole above the ground that could barely allow a person to crawl through. The welding work for installing the pipes had to be done inside the flue.

In the evening, the boiler was shut down, the flue's wind door was closed, the ventilation hole was opened, cold air was let in, and the walls were sprayed with tap water to cool the flue. As soon as the water was sprayed, steam filled the air. Before the steam dissipated, the comrades crawled into the ventilation hole, stepping on the black muddy water, racing against time to work. Hot wind blew in from the ventilation hole, mixing with the heat from the welding torch, scorching their faces. The hammer's wooden handle was so hot that it burned their hands. Especially when passing through the fire door behind the boiler, the high temperature from the furnace leaked out through the gaps, like tongues of fire, stinging their eyes. Working here was very difficult. However, they insisted on working in shifts of twenty minutes, never stopping. At this time, everyone had only one thought: "Resolve to make sacrifices, fear no difficulty, and strive for victory." They encouraged each other with the name of the hero Qiu Shaoyun, their hearts were calm, their hands were steady, and they firmly welded every joint. At four in the morning, they completed the task victoriously. The test burn far exceeded the expected effect, and the hot water produced could supply thirty-seven shower heads in the bathhouse and still had some left.

To expand the victory, they thought that if pipes were added to the furnaces of the four reverse-fire high-pressure boilers, it might be possible to replace the ten low-pressure boilers for water heating, saving more coal for the country. Thus, the battle cry of "shutting down ten low-pressure boilers" was raised. They carefully studied the construction plan and decided to try installing them in two phases.

The party branch did political and ideological work on the front line, where there was work, there were Chairman Mao's quotations, and where it was the most difficult, there were cadres. The comrades working inside the furnace crouched, bent their legs, sometimes crawled, sometimes lay flat, working for several hours at a time. Many comrades treated the boiler room as their home and did not want to leave the site after work. Thus, they worked continuously for ten days and nights, and the four reverse-fire high-pressure boilers were successively modified and began to shut down ten low-pressure boilers for testing.

However, the hot water produced by the furnace pipes could not meet the temperature requirements for heating the 42,000 square meters of barracks area. It was estimated that there was still a shortage of one million kilocalories of heat, and three low-pressure boilers had to be restarted. Seeing the coal they had just saved being burned again, everyone was unwilling, had the potential been reached? At this time, they took out their "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sat by the boiler, concentrating on studying this passage: "Humanity must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress. The theory of stagnation, pessimistic theory, and the theory of doing nothing and being complacent are all wrong." Chairman Mao's words hit the spot. They saw clearly, their courage doubled, and the distant goal of saving coal for the revolution became even more vivid.

They checked the fire and steam supply lines from beginning to end, discovering that there was a lot of waste gas in the return water tank, which could be utilized. To increase the heat absorption efficiency, they boldly imagined using radiators to replace steel pipes, installing them in the return water tank to collect heat. Saying was doing, everyone used physical objects to arrange models on the ground, discussing and finalizing the construction plan. During the day, when supplying steam, people could not enter the return water tank, so the installation work could only be done at night after the boiler was shut down for a few hours.

The return water tank was buried deep underground, with only two millstone-sized holes on top, and the steam inside was difficult to disperse. Although a lot of cold water was poured in, the temperature still could not be reduced. Due to the heat and lack of oxygen, one could not work inside for long without feeling dizzy and weak. Everyone took off their shirts, constantly using their safety helmets to scoop up cold water to pour on their heads, working for a few minutes and then lying in the water to cool down. The more difficult the conditions, the more tenacious everyone was.

When the installation of the radiators inside the return water tank was nearly completed, they encountered a new difficulty. To connect the water heating pipes, a hole had to be drilled in the tank wall. The concrete of the tank wall was over twenty centimeters thick, had been soaked in water for many years, and was extremely hard. Under such conditions, swinging a hammer to drill through the tank wall required immense strength!

However, workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most able to endure hardship and toil. They did not hesitate, using all their strength, swinging the hammer, and striking in unison. With the rhythmic and resonant sound of the hammer, they recited Chairman Mao's words: "Resolve to make sacrifices, fear no difficulty, and strive for victory." Each strike was stronger than the last, and each person struck more times. The hammer embodied the indomitable revolutionary will, and the hammering sound showed the daring and revolutionary spirit. After two nights of eighteen hours of hard work, they finally achieved this reform. They were very excited, forgetting all their fatigue, and unanimously said: "This is indeed a vivid political lesson. In the return water tank, we deeply experienced the great power of spirit transforming matter."

After sixteen days and nights of hard work, the three reform battles ended victoriously. The heat obtained exceeded the predetermined target, realizing the ideal of shutting down ten low-pressure boilers. Each heating season saved 1,800 tons of coal for the country, exceeding the coal-saving target by onefold, and creating a new record for coal-saving in the hospital.

The low-pressure boilers were dismantled, and the workers personally turned the vacant boiler room into a classroom. On the wall, Chairman Mao's portrait was hung neatly, and quotations from Chairman Mao were pasted all around. On the bookshelf, there were many of Chairman Mao's works. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the boiler room's endless revolutionary prospects, and the workers' hearts were closer to Chairman Mao.

Revolution has no end. The comrades in the boiler room understood a truth from their personal experience, which is what Chairman Mao said, "The people have limitless creativity." The more they reformed, the more confident they became, and the more they changed, the more methods they found. In 1966, they carried out another major reform on the boiler firing method. The center of the Lancashire high-pressure boiler has two fire tubes side by side. In the past, they always burned coal according to the "rules" from here. Now, they broke this framework and successfully lifted the entire boiler by eighty centimeters, burning from the bottom of the furnace, increasing the heating surface area of the boiler; at the same time, they adopted other measures to make better use of the heat energy of coal.

The boiler room was changing day by day. The number of boilers was reduced from twenty-one to seven to nine, and the coal consumption was halved. However, the boiler workers were not satisfied. They had an endless vision in their hearts. During this year's reform, they had already discussed next year's coal-saving plan. They were determined to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, ride the wind and break the waves, and achieve greater victories. (With pictures)

The comrades in the boiler class of the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army often held discussions to study the insights from Chairman Mao's works and research measures to improve work, saving more coal for the country.

The comrades in the boiler class were studying the reform of the Lancashire-style boiler.

    毛泽东思想武装起来的人有无限创造力
    ——记解放军总医院锅炉工人活学活用毛主席著作三改锅炉、节约煤炭的事迹	白愚
    编者按：实现人的思想革命化，就可以把各项工作办得又多又快又好又省。解放军总医院的锅炉工人，认真活学活用毛主席著作，三改炉灶，为国家节约大量煤炭的光辉事迹，充分说明了这一颠扑不破的真理。
    改造旧事物，创造新事物，不是一件轻而易举的事情。必须准备走曲折的道路，必须克服无数的艰难险阻。这就特别需要树立无产阶级的雄心壮志，具有敢想、敢干、敢闯的大无畏革命精神。解放军总医院的锅炉工人用毛泽东思想去改造自己的灵魂，树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想，因而才有可能“敢”字当头，排除万难，达到征服自然，改造自然的目的。
    解放军总医院锅炉房同志，活学活用毛主席著作，身在炉旁，胸怀祖国，放眼世界。一九六四年以来，他们在总后勤部党委和医院党委的领导下，冲破了旧框框、洋教条的束缚，三年三改锅炉，取得了一台锅炉顶三台用，一年的煤炭两年烧的优异成绩。
    锅炉工人们用革命的行动，深刻地揭露与批判了见物不见人、因循守旧、无所作为的思想；雄辩地证明了毛泽东思想武装起来的工人最有创造精神。
    ·两种思想　两种结论·
    毛主席说：有许多的东西，只要我们对它们陷入盲目性，缺乏自觉性，就可能成为我们的包袱，成为我们的负担。
    解放军总医院，过去只有一间锅炉房，三台炉子。随后逐渐增加到二十一台锅炉，每年要消耗不少煤。
    医院里一年四季都要供热水、蒸汽，一时也不能间断。过去由于人们看不到人的积极因素，竟然得出了这样的结论：烧锅炉只不过是被动地满足医疗的需要，“病房要消毒，我们就送气，病房喊冷，我们就添煤，没法掌握自己的命运”。由于抱着这种消极态度，人成了锅炉的奴隶，不但谈不上节煤，相反，耗煤量步步上升，烤火费年年超支。
    长期以来，流行着一种说法：“医院大、锅炉多，要求高、节煤难”。他们请来技术人员，检查了设备，核算了数据，结论是：一切都很正常，没有发现什么节煤潜力。他们又去请教工程师和专家，得到的回答是：按需要计算，还得增加两台锅炉。
    一九六四年，中央发布了有关节煤的指示，院党委立即组织大家学习。这时，工人们想：别人能节约煤炭支援国家建设，我们却在和工业争夺“粮食”，心里很不安。于是党支部组织一些同志，参观学习了别人回烧炉渣的办法，着手在低压炉进行试烧。但是，接连几次都失败了。有一部分同志就说：“炉渣能熬出多大油水？这不是豁唇子吹灯——白费劲吗？”
    营房科党支部认为：能不能烧炉渣，反映了敢不敢革命的两种思想的斗争。他们发动全科干部深入锅炉房，和工人一起试烧，共同讨论。工人班长武银双同志说：“为什么一个锅炉出来的汽，有的地方压力就比较小？那是因为管子有了漏洞；为什么别人能烧炉渣我们办不到？那是因为我们思想上有了漏洞。”大家表示，一定拿出愚公移山的精神，闯过这一关。于是又继续进行试验。十台炉互相竞赛，边干边总结，逐渐掌握了规律，用煤和炉渣各半掺烧，使水温达到了取暖的要求。
    随后，他们又运用兄弟单位缩小炉膛面积的经验，使十台低压炉的日耗煤量由二十二吨下降到十二吨，打开了节煤的第一个突破口。
    这个突破口的出现，教育了领导，也教育了锅炉房全体工人。打破了“医院大、锅炉多，要求高、节煤难”的旧框框。
    一九六五年，医院党委要求他们进一步努力，赶上并超过北京市最先进的节煤水平。
    锅炉房的同志们接受了这个任务，满怀信心地想打一个彻底的翻身仗。但是，要实现新的要求，到底靠什么呢？
    ·抓住根本环节·
    毛主席说：掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。
    正在这个时候，军委和林彪同志关于突出政治的指示下达了。营房科党支部立即组织全科人员学习这个指示。结合总结过去的工作，大摆突出政治的甜头和不突出政治的苦头。通过学习，大家认识到：节煤的潜力是无穷的，关键在于人的思想革命化，靠突出政治，靠毛泽东思想挂帅。
    工人们积极响应林彪同志的号召，很快在全班形成了天天自觉读毛主席著作的热潮，“为革命烧锅炉”的思想在头脑里扎了根。
    就在这个时候，医院举办学习毛主席四篇哲学著作的短期集训班。营房科党支部认为锅炉房的任务重，工作忙，更需要学习毛主席著作，于是把几个班长和骨干都派去参加。锅炉工李文元过去认为工作重，人手少，这个矛盾解决不了，读了《矛盾论》就明白了，人是决定的因素，把群众力量调动起来，抓住主要问题，集中兵力打歼灭战，人少也可以办大事。张宗学学了《实践论》以后，说：“毛主席说一切知识都是从实践中来的，我们只要敢字当头，在干中学，掌握客观规律，就没有克服不了的困难。”工人们都说：“参加过集训的同志变化真大，比咱们站得高了，看得远了。”班里学习的人越来越多。他们说：“只要按毛主席的指示办事，天大的困难踩脚下。”
    ·走革命的路·
    毛主席说：社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。
    毛主席的著作把工人的思想提高到一个新的境界。大家敢于设想前人没有做过的事情，开始在洋锅炉身上大闹革命。
    兰开夏式的高压锅炉，制造使用至今已有三百多年，很少有谁敢去改造它。现在我们烧火工人根据毛主席的教导，进行调查研究，仔细一测量，发现后烟道竟有二百六十度高温，大量的热能从烟囱里白白地溜掉了。算一算三百多年，它浪费了多少煤，挥霍了劳动人民多少血汗。这样一想，每个同志对洋框框切齿痛恨。正如毛主席说的：“专制主义者利于人民愚昧，我们则利于人民聪明……”。资产阶级的“专家”、“权威”摆出一副“科学”的面孔吓人，要工人永远做他们的奴隶。今天用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，要做锅炉的主人！
    正在这时候，上级营房部门派干部来蹲点，和工人们一起研究，打算利用烟道余热产生热水，提出在后烟道加排管的设想。助理员于永山同志，根据这个道理，建议在炉膛里也加上排管，可以得到更多的热水。可是装排管就等于在炉子里再加进去一台锅炉，这么大的工程谁也没有做过。既没有资料，也没有图纸。但是工人们都有一颗为革命节煤的雄心，每个人脑子里都有一个改革设计的雏型。大家相信：一定可以战胜任何困难。
    这个改造计划，早一天实现就能多为国家节约煤炭。他们决定立即冒着高温进行改装。就这样，一场紧张的“火口夺煤”战斗开始了。
    ·火口夺煤·
    毛主席说：下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。
    这是一场拚意志、拚智慧、拚力量的战斗。
      第一仗是在烟道里装排管。烟道是横在锅炉后面一条密闭的甬道，只有一个露出地面仅能容人爬行的通风口，安装排管的焊接作业必须在烟道里面进行。
    傍晚，锅炉压了火，关闭了通向烟道的风门，打开通风口，放进冷空气，用自来水冲洒四壁，使烟道降温。水一喷洒，蒸汽弥漫，没等蒸汽消失，工人同志们就从通风口钻了进去，踏着墨黑的泥水，争分夺秒地干起来。通风口吹进来呼呼热风，热气交织着焊枪焰火，火烧火燎地打在脸上。榔头木把都被烤得烫手。尤其是经过锅炉后面火门的时候，炉里的高温从缝隙里泄出来，像一条条火舌，刺得人睁不开眼。在这里作业是很困难的。但是，他们坚持二十分钟一班，交替焊接，一刻也不间断。这时候，大家只有一个想法：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们用英雄邱少云的名字互相鼓舞，心不慌，手不抖，牢牢实实地焊好了每个接口。清晨四点钟胜利完成了任务，挑火试烧，远远超过了预想的效能，烧出来的热水，同时供给三十七个喷头的澡堂都用不完。
    打一仗进一步。为了扩大战果，他们联想到，如果把四台回火式高压炉炉膛里都装上排管，就有可能代替十台低压炉供水暖，就可能多为国家节约一些煤炭。于是“停烧十台低压炉”的战斗口号提出来了。他们详细地研究了施工方案，决定分两次试装。
    党支部把政治思想工作做到第一线去，哪里有人工作，哪里就有毛主席语录牌，哪里最艰苦，哪里就有干部在。在炉膛里面工作的同志，蜷着身，弓着腿，时而匍伏，时而仰卧，一干就是几小时。许多同志以锅炉房为家，下了班仍不愿离开现场。就这样连续工作十昼夜，四台回火式高压炉相继改装完毕，开始停下十台低压炉，进行试验。
    可是，炉膛排管产生的热水供给四万二千平方米营房面积的水暖，温度没有达到需要的标准，据估算还差一百万大卡的热量，不得不重新点起三台低压炉。眼看就要夺到手的煤又填进去了，大家很不甘心，难道潜力已经到顶了吗？这时候，他们拿起《毛主席语录》本，坐在锅炉旁边，聚精会神地学了这样一段：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。停止的论点，悲观的论点，无所作为和骄傲自满的论点，都是错误的。”毛主席的话，正说到大家的心坎上。他们心明眼亮，勇气倍增，为革命节煤的远大目标分外鲜明了。
    他们把烧火送汽的线路，从头到尾查了又查，发现回水池的废气很多，可以利用。为了增加吸热效率，他们大胆地设想用暖气片代替钢管，装进回水池去收集热量。说干就干，大家用实物在地上拼凑着摆出模型，你一言我一语，就把施工方案定下来了。白天送汽时，回水池里进不去人，安装工作只能在夜间锅炉压火后的几个小时进行。
    回水池深埋在地下，顶上只有两个磨盘大的洞口，里面的蒸汽很难发散，虽然放了不少冷水进去，温度仍然降不下来。因为酷热和缺氧，在池里干不了一会就头晕乏力。大家光着膀子，不住地用安全帽舀起凉水冲头，干上几分钟就趴在水里泡一泡身子。条件越艰苦，大家越顽强。
    在回水池内部安装暖气片接近完成的时候，又遇到了新的困难。要连接水暖管线，必须在池壁上开个洞。池壁的水泥足有二十多厘米厚，长年浸在水里，坚硬异常，除了硬凿，没有别的办法。在这样的条件下，抡起铁锤来凿通池壁，需要何等的气力啊！
    然而，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，是最能吃大苦耐大劳的。他们毫不犹豫，使出全身力气，抡起大锤，一呼一应地敲打起来。随着铿锵而有节奏的锤击声，他们背诵着毛主席的话：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一锤比一锤打得响，一个比一个打得多，铁锤凝结着无坚不摧的革命意志，锤声显示了敢想敢干的革命精神。经过两个晚上十八个小时的苦战，终于胜利地实现了这项改革。他们非常兴奋，把疲劳忘得一干二净，不约而同地说：“这真是一堂生动的政治课，咱们在回水池里，深刻地体验了精神变物质的巨大威力。”
    经过十六个日夜奋战，三项革新的战斗胜利结束了。取得的热量，超过了预定指标，实现了停烧十台低压锅炉的理想。每个烤火期为国家节约了一千八百吨煤炭，超额完成了翻一番的节煤任务，使每平方米取暖耗煤量创造了医院节煤的最新纪录。
    低压锅炉拆掉了，工人们亲手把空出来的锅炉房布置成一间课堂，墙上端端正正地挂着毛主席像，四面贴满了毛主席语录，书架上放了许多毛主席著作。毛泽东思想的光辉，照亮了锅炉房不断革命的前景，工人们的心和毛主席贴得更紧了。
    革命无止境。锅炉房的同志们从切身的经验中领会了一条真理，这就是毛主席所说的，“人民群众有无限的创造力。”他们愈革愈有信心，愈改愈有办法，一九六六年，又对烧锅炉方法进行了一次大改革。兰开夏高压锅炉的中心并排有两个火筒，过去，一直是按“规矩”从这里烧煤的。现在，他们打破了这个框框，成功地把整个锅炉抬高了八十厘米，从炉底烧火，加大了锅炉的受热面积；同时，还采用其它一些措施，以更多地发挥煤炭的热能。
    锅炉房里日新月异地变化着。锅炉已由二十一台减少到七到九台，耗煤量下降了一半。但是锅炉工人们并不满足，他们心里有一个无限广阔的远景，在今年改革过程中，就已经讨论了明年节煤的新计划了。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，乘风破浪，夺取更大的胜利。（附图片）
