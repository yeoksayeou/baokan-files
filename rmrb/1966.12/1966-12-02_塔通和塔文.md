Tathong and Tavien are two military strongholds in the southeastern part of Xieng Khouang Province, Laos, holding significant strategic importance. They control the highway from the Xieng Khouang Plain to the towns of Nong Het and Tchepone on the Mekong River.

The region where Tathong and Tavien are located was liberated, along with other parts of Xieng Khouang Province, by the combat forces of the Lao Patriotic Front and the neutralist forces at the end of 1960 and the beginning of 1961. In June 1962, when the National Union Government of Laos issued the formal ceasefire order, Tathong and the surrounding areas were under the control of the patriotic neutralist forces and the Lao Patriotic Front. In April 1963, the U.S. imperialists instigated the rightist forces in Laos to illegally invade the Xieng Khouang region, seizing Tathong, Tavien, and some surrounding areas. In May 1964, the Lao patriotic forces counterattacked the forces of the Vientiane regime, recapturing these two towns. By the end of last year, Tathong and Tavien had once again been occupied by the U.S. imperialists' puppet army.

    塔通和塔文
    塔通和塔文是老挝川圹省东南部的两个军事重镇，具有重要的战略地位，它们控制着从查尔平原通向湄公河边城镇北汕和他曲的公路。
    塔通和塔文所在的地区，是在一九六○年底和一九六一年初同川圹省其它地方一起，被老挝爱国战线党战斗部队和中立力量部队解放的。一九六二年六月，老挝三方面民族团结政府发布正式停火令时，塔通市和周围地区，为爱国中立力量和老挝爱国战线党控制。一九六三年四月，美帝国主义唆使老挝右派非法侵入查尔平原—川圹地区，占领了塔通、塔文及周围的一些地方。一九六四年五月，老挝爱国力量反击沙湾拿吉集团的进攻，收复了这两个市镇。去年年底，塔通和塔文又被美帝的走狗军队占领。
