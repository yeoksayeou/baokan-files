The revolutionary youngsters of the New Northern University Long March Team, following Chairman Mao's teachings that "The Long March is a manifesto, the Long March is a propaganda team, the Long March is a seed-sowing machine," actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution during their long march. This is a scene of them performing in a rural area, warmly welcomed by the broad masses of commune members.

Crossing thousands of mountains and wading through ten thousand rivers, the Red Guards fear no difficulties in their long march. The long march teams from Beijing Agricultural University and Beijing Institute of Light Industry are advancing through the valleys, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao, determined to forge ahead on the path opened by Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary students of Renmin University of China, forming the "Red Successors Long March Team," visited the red locomotive engine "Mao Zedong No." when passing through Fengtai, filled with excitement. This is the locomotive driver, Comrade Cai Lianxing (left one), introducing to the revolutionary youngsters how they study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

A long march Red Guard team composed of more than a hundred revolutionary youngsters from thirteen provinces and municipalities across the country carried forward the glorious traditions of revolutionary forebears. During the long march, they actively participated in labor and learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants. This is a scene of them helping commune members thresh beans during their march.

A long march team composed of female students from Xianyang Machinery Manufacturing School solemnly swore at the grave of Comrade Zhang Zide in the Yan'an Martyrs' Cemetery: "We will always listen to Chairman Mao's words, take revolutionary martyrs as our examples, serve the people all our lives, and study Chairman Mao's works all our lives."

The revolutionary youngsters of the long march teams everywhere carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the old Red Army, observing the three main disciplines and eight points for attention. Wherever they go, they propagate Mao Zedong Thought, do good deeds, and blend in with the masses. This is a scene of team members of a long march team sweeping the courtyard for the villagers early in the morning.

Chairman Mao said, "We all come from the rivers and lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." The revolutionary youngsters, following Chairman Mao's teachings, care for, love, and help each other during the march. When a comrade's foot blisters, other comrades rush to carry his luggage for him.

    红卫兵不怕远征难
    新北大长征队的革命小将，按照毛主席“长征是宣言书，长征是宣传队，长征是播种机”的教导，在长征途中积极宣传毛泽东思想，宣传无产阶级文化大革命。这是他们在农村演出，受到广大社员热烈欢迎的情形。
    越千山，涉万水，红卫兵不怕远征难。北京农业大学、北京轻工业学院的两支长征队伍行进在山谷中，他们高举毛主席像和毛主席语录，表示坚决沿着毛主席开辟的道路奋勇前进。
    中国人民大学革命学生组成的“红色接班人长征队”，途经丰台时，怀着激动的心情访问了用毛泽东思想武装起来的红色火车头——“毛泽东号”机车包车组。这是包车组的司机长蔡连兴同志（左一）向革命小将们介绍他们活学活用毛主席著作的情形。
    由全国十三个省市的一百多名革命小将组成的一支长征红卫军，发扬革命前辈的光荣传统。在长征途中积极参加劳动，向贫下中农学习。这是他们在行军途中和贫下中农社员一起打豆子。
    咸阳机器制造学校的一支由女同学组成的长征队，在延安烈士陵园张思德同志墓前庄严宣誓：永远听毛主席的话，以革命先烈为榜样，为人民服务一辈子，学习一辈子毛主席著作。
    长征队的革命小将处处发扬老红军的革命传统，遵守三大纪律八项注意，走到哪里，毛泽东思想宣传到哪里，把好事做到哪里，处处和群众打成一片。这是一支长征队的队员们，清晨起来在为老乡扫院子。
    毛主席说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”革命小将们遵照毛主席的教导，在征途中互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。一个战友脚上打了泡，其他战友就抢着替他背行李。
