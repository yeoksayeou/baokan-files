Dear Red Guards and revolutionary students! Recently, many of you have responded to Chairman Mao's call and actively participated in the trial of long-distance marching. I am deeply moved by your revolutionary actions.

You will certainly encounter many difficulties during your long-distance marches. However, revolutionary soldiers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, can overcome all hardships and difficulties. Over the past few years, in this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary army, I have undergone rigorous long-distance marching training and have gained such experiences.

I enlisted in August 1961 and have participated in seven major and minor field training exercises, covering over 5,000 miles. During these marches, I deeply felt that marching relies on legs, legs rely on thought, and thought relies on the books of Chairman Mao. With Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, we can overcome all kinds of difficulties, dare to train ourselves in harsh environments, and insist on completing the marching tasks under any circumstances.

When I first enlisted, I did not fully understand the question of "for whom we march and for whom we endure hardships," and I did not link "marching" with "revolution." Therefore, I regarded marching as a "tough job." Later, the party branch repeatedly organized us to study the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and I gradually understood the reason for training marches for the world revolution and enduring hardships for the Chinese people and the people of the world. Chairman Mao said: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. This army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the interests of the people." I thought that for revolutionary soldiers, serving the people is not an empty slogan; training marches is a concrete way to serve the people. Our marching training, facing wind and snow, overcoming difficulties, climbing mountains, and fording streams, is to defend the motherland so that our people can build socialism with peace of mind. With the hardships of a few, we exchange the happiness of the majority. This is not hardship but the greatest joy. After understanding this truth, I marched with more energy.

Long-distance marching is indeed tough. Feet blister, shoulders chafe, backs ache, and one might even lose a few pounds. Natural conditions may also bring various difficulties. Especially in the most difficult and fatigued moments, whether one can persist to the end is a test. To pass this test, physical strength is a factor, but the most important thing is whether we have a firm will and the perseverance to overcome difficulties.

In practice, I have felt that willpower comes first in marching. I was physically weak since childhood, so how did I persist in marching? Mainly through willpower. With a mindset of fearing hardship and difficulty, ten units of strength can be reduced to five or six; with tenacious perseverance and strong willpower, five units of strength can be increased to seven or eight, even ten. One winter during a field training exercise, we marched over 90 miles, and along the way, we had to cross a mountain over 500 meters high. This was the first time in my life I had walked such a long distance and climbed such a high mountain. When the troops reached the foot of the mountain to rest, I saw the towering mountain and felt anxious. Halfway up the mountain, my legs trembled, and my cotton clothes were soaked with sweat. I wanted to sit down and rest, but suddenly I saw a piece of paper with Chairman Mao's words on a large rock by the roadside: "Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, raise our courage." Chairman Mao's words gave me boundless strength. I thought: difficulties are dead, but people are alive. If I climb one step higher, the mountain top will be one foot closer. As long as I can persist, I will definitely trample the high mountain under my feet. If I cannot overcome this difficulty, how can I defeat American imperialism! So, I endured the pain, gritted my teeth, and followed the troops without lagging behind, persisting to the top of the mountain.

Long-distance marching, especially continuous marching, is also a test of the revolutionary style of revolutionary soldiers. Whether one can have the tenacity and endurance to persist to the last minute is an important indicator of whether a soldier has a hard-boned spirit. Therefore, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate an indomitable and unbreakable hard-boned style. We often use Chairman Mao's instructions on "promoting a brave fighting spirit, fearlessness of sacrifice, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous combat (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)" and his teachings of "making up our minds, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory" to inspire our revolutionary heroic spirit. Once during a winter field training exercise, on the last day, the troops set out at eleven o'clock at night and reached the highway at dawn. At this time, the leadership issued an order for "rapid advance," and we covered over 40 miles in three hours. My feet had several blisters. Just when I felt extremely difficult, a note was passed from behind. I read it while walking: "Make up our minds, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." After reading it, I immediately passed the note to the comrades in front. It was like adding oil to a machine; I suddenly felt that Chairman Mao was with us, and my whole body was filled with energy.

Dear Red Guard comrades! Our training in long-distance marching and your long-distance marching are both for the revolution, both to learn and spread Mao Zedong Thought during the march, and to temper the revolutionary will. In the past few days, I have seen teams of Red Guards and revolutionary students carrying red flags, backpacks, language boards, and singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, coming and going from all over the country to conduct revolutionary great linking. This scene is so inspiring! We must seriously learn from your determination to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end and your fearless, forward-looking revolutionary spirit, and hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought!

    步行串连最能锻炼革命意志
    ——和革命小将谈谈长途行军的体会
    解放军某部学习毛主席著作积极分子　包成勇
    亲爱的红卫兵和革命师生们！最近你们许多人响应毛主席的号召，积极投入了长征式步行串连的试点，我深深为你们的革命行动所感动。
    你们在全程步行串连中，一定会遇到不少的困难。但是，革命战士有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就能够战胜一切艰难困苦。这几年来，我在革命部队这个毛泽东思想的大学校里，苦练长途徒步行军，就有这样的体会。
    我是一九六一年八月入伍的，入伍以来参加过大小七次野营训练，走了五千多里路。我在行军的过程中，深深体会到：行军靠腿，腿靠思想，思想靠毛主席的书来武装。头脑里有了毛泽东思想，就能排除各种困难，勇于在艰苦的环境中锻炼自己，在任何情况下都能坚持完成行军任务。
    我刚入伍的时候，对“为谁行军、为谁吃苦”这个问题认识不足，没有把“行军”与“革命”挂起钩来，因此把行军看作是“苦事情”。后来，党支部反复组织我们学习《为人民服务》这篇文章，才逐步弄清了为世界革命练行军，为中国人民和世界人民吃苦的道理。毛主席说：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我想，对我们革命战士来说，为人民服务不是一句空话，练行军就是具体地为人民服务。我们冒着风雪，迎着困难，爬山涉水的行军训练，就是为了保卫祖国，使我国人民能够安心建设社会主义。以少数人的辛苦，换来多数人的幸福，这不是苦，而是最大的快乐。当我弄清了这个道理以后，我就越走越有劲。
    徒步行军当然是艰苦的，脚打泡，肩磨破，腰酸背痛，甚至还要瘦掉几斤肉；自然条件也可能会带来各种各样的困难。尤其是在最困难最疲劳的时刻，能不能坚持到最后，这是一个考验。要经受住这个考验，身体强弱是一个因素，但最主要的是看我们有没有坚强的意志和克服困难的毅力。
    我在实践中体会到：行军中意志第一。我从小身体比较弱，行军靠什么坚持？主要靠意志。有了怕苦畏难的思想，十分体力能减弱到五分、六分；有了顽强的毅力，坚强的意志，五分体力可以增强到七分八分，甚至十分。有一年冬季野营，一次行军跑了九十多里路，途中还翻越一座五百多米高的大山。这是我有生以来第一次走这么远的路，第一次翻这么高的山。部队来到山脚下休息，当我看到高耸入云的大山，心里直发慌，爬到半山腰，两腿直打颤，棉衣都被汗水湿透了，正想坐下来歇一歇，忽然看到路边大石上贴着一条毛主席语录：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的话，给我增添了无限力量。我想：困难是死的，人是活的，我向上登一步，山顶就离我近一尺，只要我能够坚持下去，就一定能把高山踩在脚底下。如果这一点困难都克服不了，怎么能斗倒美帝国主义！于是忍着痛，咬着牙，一步不拉地跟上部队，坚持爬到了山顶。
    徒步行军，特别是连续行军，也是对革命战士革命作风的一个考验。能不能有坚持到最后一分钟的硬劲和耐力，是衡量战士有没有硬骨头精神的一个重要标志。这就必须用毛泽东思想来培养拖不垮、打不烂的硬骨头作风。我们经常以毛主席关于“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”的指示和“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，来激发我们的革命英雄主义精神。有一次冬季野营，最后一天，部队半夜十一点钟出发，天亮上了公路。这时领导上传来了“快速前进”的命令，我们在三个小时跑了四十多里路，我的脚底打了好几个泡。正感到万分困难的时候，后面递来了一张纸条，我边走边看：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”看完后，立即把纸条传给前面的同志。这真像机器加油，我好像突然感到毛主席就在我们身边，浑身都添了劲。
    亲爱的红卫兵同志们！我们练徒步行军和你们步行串连一样，都是为了革命，都是为了在行军的过程中学习毛泽东思想，传播毛泽东思想，磨练革命意志。这几天来，我看到一队队红卫兵和革命师生，扛着红旗，背着背包，挂着语录板，唱着毛主席语录歌，南来北往，到全国各地进行革命大串连。这种情景是多么振奋人心呵！我们一定要认真学习你们这种誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心和无所畏惧、勇往直前的革命精神，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗举得更高！
