The song "East Is Red" echoes through the universe; Chairman Mao is the banner of world revolution. The red sun rises over Tiananmen Gate, and sunlight bathes the five continents. The mountains and seas are dyed red, and revolutionary people raise their heads. They look towards Beijing with eager eyes: the red flag dances in the wind. The great banner holder is our Chairman Mao, waving his mighty hand from Tiananmen Gate. Chairman Mao, waving his mighty hand, leads the revolutionary army forward; the four volumes of books illuminate the ten thousand li path, striding forward vigorously and heroically. With a long whip in hand, he subdues wolves and tigers; the surging tide swallows clowns. To sweep away all the harmful creatures on earth, uproot them completely!

Chairman Mao waves his mighty hand, and the winds of revolution roar across the five continents and four seas; looking out with joy at Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the spirit of Jinggangshan spreads everywhere! Countless sparks ignite vast areas, illuminating the sky; countless people hold revolutionary guns in their hands; battle songs shatter the enemy's courage, and every mountain and river will turn red!

Chairman Mao waves his mighty hand, and the soldiers follow closely behind, with red hearts, firm bones, and unyielding will, fearless in the face of fire and knives! Even if their heads are cut off and blood flows, they will follow Chairman Mao to the death. They will fight bravely, one after another, to seize the bright light of communism and illuminate the entire globe!

    毛主席是世界革命的旗手
    廖代谦《东方红》的歌声响彻宇宙，毛主席是世界革命的旗手。天安门上升起红太阳，阳光洒遍了五大洲。染红了高山染红了海，革命的人民仰起头。翘首齐向北京望：红通通大旗迎风舞。伟大的旗手是咱毛主席，天安门上他挥巨手。毛主席，挥巨手，率领革命大军向前走；四卷书照亮了万里路，健步如飞雄赳赳。长缨在手缚狼虎，洪流滚滚吞小丑。要把人间一切害人虫，扫完除尽连根揪！毛主席挥巨手，五洲四海风雷吼；放眼喜看亚非拉，井冈山精神传处处！多少处星火燎原烛天亮，多少人革命枪杆握在手；战歌震碎敌人胆，山山水水要红透！毛主席挥巨手，战士紧跟着向前走，心红骨硬斗志坚，火海刀山眉不皱！头可断，血可流，誓死跟着毛主席走。前赴后继去战斗，要夺来共产主义光辉照全球！
