The U.S. imperialists have been waging a war of aggression against Vietnam for more than ten years. They have used every means to try to subjugate the Vietnamese people, but they have failed. The Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party, have been fighting bravely and have achieved great victories. The U.S. imperialists, in their desperation, have resorted to various tricks to prolong the war and to deceive the world public opinion. They have even proposed to "negotiate" with the Vietnamese people, but this is just a trick to cover up their aggression and to prolong the war.

The U.S. imperialists have been using the "Vietnamization" policy to shift the burden of the war to the puppet regime in South Vietnam. They have been training and equipping the puppet army to fight against the Vietnamese people. They have been bombing and shelling the North Vietnamese people to force them to submit. But the Vietnamese people have not been intimidated. They have been fighting bravely and have achieved great victories.

The Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party, have been fighting bravely and have achieved great victories. The U.S. imperialists will never be able to subjugate the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people will never be intimidated. They will fight bravely and will achieve final victory.

The U.S. imperialists will never be able to achieve their goals in Vietnam. They will never be able to subjugate the Vietnamese people. They will never be able to prolong the war. They will never be able to deceive the world public opinion. They will never be able to cover up their aggression. They will never be able to shift the burden of the war to the puppet regime in South Vietnam. They will never be able to achieve their goals in Vietnam.

The Vietnamese people will achieve final victory. They will achieve national independence and reunification. They will achieve socialism. They will achieve final victory. The U.S. imperialists will be defeated. They will be driven out of Vietnam. They will be driven out of Indochina. They will be driven out of Asia. They will be driven out of the world. The Vietnamese people will achieve final victory.
