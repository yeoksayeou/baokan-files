The workers in the printing and etching department of Wuxi Dyeing Factory have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, daring to think, dare to act, and dare to make revolution. They have broken through the obstruction of bourgeois technical "authorities" and, with the help of brother factories in Shanghai, successfully experimented with a set of unique spray etching technology for printing cylinders in China.

Previously, printing cylinders for printed fabrics were all hand-engraved, with very low efficiency. Later, the development of photogravure technology greatly improved efficiency and the level of printing technology. The new spray etching technology pioneered by the workers of Wuxi Dyeing Factory has achieved an even higher level of engraving for some very complex patterns.

The successful trial of the spray etching technology is the result of the workers in the printing and etching department of Wuxi Dyeing Factory studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, breaking free from the constraints of foreign frameworks, and overcoming the obstacles of bourgeois technical "authorities."

Currently, the factory has basically ended the long-used manual engraving method. More than 95% of the patterns that previously required photogravure have now been replaced by the new spray etching technology. More than half a year of production practice has proven that the spray etching technology has significant advantages.

    无锡印染厂创喷涂雕刻新技术
    无锡印染厂印花雕刻间工人，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢想、敢干、敢革命，冲破资产阶级技术“权威”的阻挠，在上海兄弟厂的帮助下，试验成功了一套我国独有的印花滚筒喷涂雕刻新技术。
    印花布用的印花滚筒，从前都是靠手工雕刻的，效率很低；后来发展了照相雕刻技术，大大提高了效率和印花技术水平。无锡印染厂职工首创的喷涂雕刻新技术，在雕刻一些难度很高的花型时，达到比照相雕刻更高的水平。
    喷涂雕刻新技术的试验成功，是无锡印染厂印花雕刻工人活学活用毛主席著作，打破洋框框的束缚，冲垮资产阶级技术“权威”的阻力取得的。
    目前，这个厂已经基本结束了多年沿用的手工雕刻方法，百分之九十五以上需要照相雕刻的花样，都已由喷涂雕刻新技术代替。半年多的生产实践证明，喷涂雕刻新技术具有很大的优越性。
