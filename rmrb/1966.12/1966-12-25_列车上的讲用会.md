On the train from Dalian to Beijing, in every car, there are portraits of our most respected and beloved great leader Chairman Mao, and red quotation boards with Chairman Mao's sayings. People from all over the country, in this temporary collective, are reading Chairman Mao's quotations, studying the Sixteen Points, and reading newspapers...

At this moment, a soldier walked to the middle of one of the cars and said, "Comrades, shall we use this time to hold a study session on the 'Three Articles'?" The passengers all unanimously agreed, "Good!" This soldier recited a segment of a quick-talk about studying the "Three Articles." Another soldier enthusiastically shared his experiences in studying the "Three Articles" and fighting against selfishness. He said: I was born in the new society and grew up under the red flag. I am nurtured by the Party. I thought my thoughts would only become redder and could not turn bad. I thought the theory of peaceful evolution had nothing to do with me. Later, the leadership assigned me to the kitchen. I always felt that this job was not suitable for me, so I did not work hard or take it seriously. Someone criticized me for not acting like a cook. At this time, I carefully studied the "Three Articles." Through studying, I gradually realized: not wanting to cook is individualism, it is bourgeois ideology stirring up trouble in my mind. Peaceful evolution is not unrelated to me, but it is very relevant. Cooking for class brothers is also doing revolution. There is no shameful revolutionary work, only shameful thoughts. The stove is my revolutionary battlefield.

As the soldier finished speaking, an old worker from Beijing stood up excitedly and shared his experiences in studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune."

The train attendant, Zhao Zhenmei, listening and listening, also walked to the middle and started speaking: After graduating from junior high school, I became a train attendant and was very happy. I thought, this time I can travel all over the country and broaden my horizons. After working for a while, I felt that being a train attendant was too "lowly" and had no future, so I became wavering again. Later, I brought this question to study the "Three Articles," and by examining my own thoughts, I realized that it was not my work that was "lowly," but my thoughts that were lowly. From then on, I gradually corrected my attitude and served the passengers wholeheartedly.

The study session ended amidst enthusiastic applause. The passengers were all smiles, singing the quotation song in unison: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism."

    列车上的讲用会
    在大连——北京的列车上，每节车厢里，都悬挂着我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的像，悬挂着鲜红的毛主席语录牌。来自五湖四海的人们，在这个临时大家庭里，读着毛主席语录，学习着十六条，看着报纸……。
    这时，一位解放军战士走到一节车厢中间，说：“旅客们，我们利用这一段时间开个学习‘老三篇’的讲用会好不好？”旅客们都异口同声地说：“好！”这位解放军战士说了一段学习“老三篇”的快板，另一位解放军战士热情地讲了他学习“老三篇”，狠斗“我”字的体会。他说：我生在新社会，长在红旗下，是党培养起来的。我想，我的思想只会变红，不可能变坏，和平演变与我关系不大。后来，领导调我到炊事班工作，我总觉得这个工作不适合我去做，所以工作起来不认真、不负责。有人批评我不像个炊事员。这时，我仔细地学习“老三篇”。通过学习，我逐步认识到：不愿意做饭，这是个人主义，是资产阶级思想在我脑子里兴风作浪。和平演变不是与我无关，而是大有关系。为阶级兄弟做饭也是干革命，只有丢人的思想，没有丢人的革命工作。锅台就是我的革命阵地。
    那位解放军战士的话音刚落，来自北京的一位老工人激动地站起来，讲了一段学习《为人民服务》的体会。
    列车员赵振梅，听着听着，也走到中间讲起来：我初中毕业后，当上了列车员，十分高兴。心想，这回可以走南闯北，开阔开阔眼界。干了一段时间，觉得列车员太“低气”，没有什么前途，于是又动摇起来了。后来我带着这个问题，学习了“老三篇”，对照自己的思想一检查，才认识到不是我的工作“低气”，是我的思想低气。从此，我就慢慢地端正了服务态度，热心地为旅客服务了。
    讲用会在大家的热烈掌声中结束了。旅客们喜笑颜开，齐声高唱语录歌：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”
