According to a report from New China News Agency on the 8th, the public in Copenhagen expressed strong opposition to the delegation from the South Vietnamese puppet regime that was touring Nordic countries.

On the evening of the 6th, a delegation led by Chen Wen'en, a member of the National Leadership Committee of the South Vietnamese puppet government, held a lecture at a commercial school in Copenhagen. They attempted to justify the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam. However, as soon as Chen Wen'en began to speak, he was surrounded and attacked by hundreds of protesters. The crowd threw rotten eggs and stink bombs at Chen Wen'en and his entourage. The demonstrators also overturned Chen Wen'en's table and shouted, "Down with Fascism!" and "Long live the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam!" On the 7th, when Chen Wen'en spoke at another gathering, he again faced protests from the public.

    丹麦公众用臭鸡蛋围攻
    据新华社八日讯　哥本哈根消息：丹麦公众愤怒抗议到北欧国家进行游说的南越傀儡政权的代表团。
    六日晚，由南越傀儡政府国家领导委员会委员陈文恩率领的代表团在哥本哈根的一所商业学校里举行讲演会，力图为美帝国主义的侵越战争辩解。但是，当陈文恩刚一开始讲话，就遭到数百名到会群众的围攻，群众向陈文恩及其一伙扔臭鸡蛋和臭气弹。示威群众还打翻了陈文恩的桌子，并且高呼：“打倒法西斯！”“南越民族解放阵线万岁！”七日，陈文恩在另外一个集会上讲话时，又遇到了群众的示威。
