Vice Premier Chen Yi today received Syrian Ambassador to China, Bashir Sadik, and had a friendly conversation with him.

Ambassador Sadik mentioned the plundering and exploitation of Syria and Arab countries by the "Iraq Petroleum Company," which is operated by imperialist capital from the United States and Britain. He said that the Syrian government firmly demands that the company compensate for the past overdue transit taxes on oil.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Syrian government is correct. We firmly support the Syrian people and government in their struggle against the political oppression and economic plundering by imperialism. The Chinese people will forever stand with the Syrian people and the Arab people, who have a glorious anti-imperialist tradition.
