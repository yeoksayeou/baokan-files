Dear Red Guards and revolutionary youngsters!

Before we discuss the issue of upholding the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention, let us first talk about how the People's Liberation Army's Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention came into being.

The Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention were personally formulated by our great leader Chairman Mao during the Second Revolutionary Civil War for the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. The Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army is fundamentally different from the old armies of the exploiting classes. All old armies were tools of oppression used by the reactionary ruling classes to suppress the people. They would curse and beat the people at the slightest provocation, and seize anything they saw. They were armies that were hated by the people. The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, on the other hand, is a new type of people's army, the people's own army. As early as the initial period of the Red Army, Chairman Mao required the troops to be polite when dealing with the masses, to conduct fair trade, not to conscript labor, not to beat people, and not to curse people. In the spring of 1928, when the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was in Jinggangshan, Chairman Mao personally announced three disciplines to the Red Army: first, actions must follow orders; second, do not take a single item from the workers and peasants; third, when confiscating property from local tyrants, it must be for public use. In the summer of 1928, Chairman Mao, based on the situation at the time, further proposed six points for attention: one, cover doors; two, tie up straw mats; three, speak politely; four, conduct fair trade; five, return borrowed items; six, compensate for damaged items. After 1929, Chairman Mao changed the third discipline from "do not take a single item from the workers and peasants" to "do not take a single needle or thread from the people," and changed "when confiscating property from local tyrants, it must be for public use" to "when raising funds, it must be for public use." For the six points for attention, two more items were added: "avoid women when bathing" and "do not search the pockets of prisoners." Thus, the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention were formed. On October 10, 1947, at the beginning of the great turnaround in the People's Liberation War, the Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army officially issued an order, making a unified regulation of the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention for the People's Liberation Army, and reissued them. This is the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention that all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army strictly adhere to today. The formulation of the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention is our great leader Chairman Mao's great contribution to the construction of the proletarian army. The Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention are important components of the political work of the Red Army, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the People's Liberation Army. They have played a great role in the construction of this new type of people's army, in correctly handling internal relations within the army, in uniting the masses, and in establishing the correct policy of the people's army towards prisoners of war.

Everyone knows that the Red Army, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the People's Liberation Army are brave and skilled in battle; at the same time, they are the most disciplined. Under any circumstances, they strictly follow Chairman Mao's teachings and have achieved strict discipline and no petty offenses. I remember that during the War of Liberation, in the spring of 1948, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in cooperation with brother units, captured the city of Luoyang. When the soldiers rushed into a building, the enemy had already fled, and the owner of the house had also hidden somewhere. The building was quiet, with no one around. On a table, there was a steel-cased pocket watch ticking away. After the soldiers searched the place, the items in the building remained untouched. The battle ended, and the third platoon was ordered to stay in this building. Seeing this watch, the soldiers all liked it. In times of war, how much the officers and soldiers needed a watch! But everyone voluntarily adhered to and maintained the discipline of the People's Liberation Army, and no one moved the watch. When the troops departed, the deputy political instructor checked the discipline among the people, and the items in the building were untouched, with the steel-cased watch still on the table, ticking away.

In May 1949, when the People's Liberation Army liberated Shanghai, the first units to enter the urban area, in order not to disturb the citizens of Shanghai at night, the soldiers voluntarily slept under the eaves of the houses on both sides of the street. This incident was praised nationwide. As Chairman Mao taught us: "The army must integrate with the masses, so that the army appears to the masses as their own army. Such an army will be invincible in the world..." The People's Liberation Army, from small to large, from weak to strong, has been invincible. Apart from the fundamental reason that it is under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and that it is an army of workers and peasants with strong political work, its strict discipline and no petty offenses are also inseparable.

Red Guards and revolutionary young people should regard the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention as the family heirloom of the People's Liberation Army, as the revolutionary family heirloom, and study and strictly adhere to them. They should become models of adhering to the Party's policies and models of adhering to discipline, so as to better fulfill the great mission bestowed upon us by the great era of Mao Zedong.

To voluntarily adhere to the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention, one must first study Chairman Mao's teachings on the people's army, people's war, military-civilian relations, and the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention, as well as the relevant policies of the Party. This way, everyone will understand that policies and strategies are the lifeblood of the Party. The words and deeds of every comrade must take the interests of the whole Party as the starting point and take the greatest benefit of the broadest masses of the people and being supported by the broadest masses of the people as the highest standard. This way, one can continuously strengthen the awareness of policies and discipline and continuously improve the voluntariness of implementing policies and discipline. Cadres must take the lead in learning and learn better, becoming models of voluntarily adhering to discipline. For those who go out for setting up camp (advance party), purchasing, cooking, etc., more attention must be paid to strengthening education on policies and discipline.

To strictly adhere to the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention, one must conduct social investigations in the places they pass through. Understand the production and living conditions of the local people, as well as their religious beliefs, customs, and habits, so as to timely educate the troops.

For the "four olds" among the masses, believe that the masses can educate themselves and liberate themselves; actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, raise the class consciousness of the masses, and let the masses voluntarily destroy the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes' "four olds" and establish proletarian "four news." In some places, respect the customs and habits of the masses and wait for their enlightenment.

When the troops leave the place of residence, conduct a check on discipline among the people. If there are phenomena of violating policies and discipline, deal with them promptly and appropriately. Praise those who implement policies and discipline well, and criticize those who implement policies and discipline poorly. The methods of inspection can be door-to-door visits or holding mass consultation meetings to widely solicit the masses' opinions on the troops. Take the masses' opinions seriously, and thank the masses for their support and help.

### 遵守三大纪律八项注意

专栏：

    遵守三大纪律八项注意亲爱的红卫兵战士们，亲爱的革命小将们！
    在谈遵守三大纪律八项注意这个问题以前，我们先来谈一谈人民解放军的三大纪律八项注意是怎么来的。
    三大纪律八项注意，这是我们伟大领袖毛主席，在第二次国内革命战争中，为中国工农红军亲手制定的纪律。中国工农红军是和过去剥削阶级的旧军队截然不同的两种军队。一切旧军队都是反动统治阶级压迫人民的工具。他们见了老百姓，张口就骂，举手就打，见东西就抢……。他们是不得人心的反人民的军队。工农红军是一支新型的人民军队，是人民的子弟兵。还在红军初创时期，毛主席就要求部队，对待群众要说话和气，买卖公平，不拉夫，不打人，不骂人。一九二八年春天，工农红军在井冈山的时候，毛主席亲自向红军宣布了三项纪律：第一，行动听指挥；第二，不拿工人农民一点东西；第三，打土豪要归公。一九二八年夏天，毛主席根据当时的情况，进一步提出了六项注意：一，上门板；二，捆铺草；三，说话和气；四，买卖公平；五，借东西要还；六，损坏东西要赔。一九二九年以后，毛主席又把三大纪律中的“不拿工人农民一点东西”，改为“不拿群众一针一线”，“打土豪要归公”，改为“筹款要归公”。对于六项注意，增加了“洗澡避女人”和“不搜俘虏腰包”两项内容，从而成了三大纪律八项注意。一九四七年十月十日，也就是伟大的人民解放战争开始转入反攻的时期，中国人民解放军总部正式发出了训令，对人民解放军的三大纪律八项注意，又作了统一规定，重行颁布。这就是现在人民解放军全体指战员严格遵守的三大纪律八项注意。三大纪律八项注意的制定，是我们伟大领袖毛主席对无产阶级军队建设的伟大贡献。三大纪律八项注意，是红军、八路军、新四军、人民解放军政治工作的重要内容，对于这支新型的人民军队的建设，对于正确处理军队内部关系，团结人民群众和确立人民军队对待俘虏的正确政策，都起了伟大的作用。
    大家知道，红军、八路军、新四军、人民解放军是英勇善战的；同时，又是最守纪律的。他们在任何情况下，都坚决遵循毛主席的教导，做到了纪律严明，秋毫无犯。记得在解放战争时期，一九四八年春天，人民解放军某部配合兄弟部队攻占了洛阳城。当战士们冲进一座楼房时，敌人已经逃走了，房主人也不知躲到哪里去了。楼上静悄悄的，一个人也没有。在一张桌子上，还放着一只钢壳怀表，正在滴滴答答地走着。战士们搜索过后，楼上的东西，仍旧原封不动。战斗结束，三连奉命住在这座楼上。看见这只怀表，战士们都很喜爱。在战争时期，指战员们多么需要一只表啊！可是，大家自觉地遵守和维护人民解放军的纪律，谁也没有动一动这只表。部队出发了，副指导员检查群众纪律，楼上的东西丝毫未动，那只钢壳表依然放在桌上，滴滴答答地走着。
    一九四九年五月，人民解放军解放上海时，首先进入市区的解放军部队，为了在夜间不惊扰上海市民，战士们都自觉地睡在马路两旁的房檐下。这件事在全国传为佳话。正如毛主席教导我们的：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下……。”人民解放军所以从小到大，从弱到强，所向无敌，除了根本上是由于党和毛主席的英明领导，由于它是一支工人农民的军队，有着坚强的政治工作以外，同它的纪律严明，秋毫无犯是完全分不开的。
    红卫兵战士们和革命的青少年们，应该把三大纪律八项注意，当作人民解放军的传家宝，当作革命的传家宝，好好学习，严格遵守。要像人民解放军那样成为遵守党的政策的模范，成为遵守纪律的模范，以便更好地完成伟大的毛泽东时代所赋予我们的伟大使命。
    要做到自觉地遵守三大纪律八项注意，首先要学好毛主席有关人民军队、人民战争、军民关系、三大纪律八项注意的论述，和党的有关政策。使大家认识到：政策和策略是党的生命，每个同志的一言一行，都必须以全党的利益为出发点，以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。以便不断增强政策纪律观念，不断提高贯彻执行政策纪律的自觉性。干部要学在前头，要学得更好些，成为自觉地遵守纪律的模范。对于设营（打前站）、采购、炊事等外出人员，更要注意加强政策纪律教育。
    要严格遵守三大纪律八项注意，就要对所经过的地方进行社会调查。了解当地群众的生产和生活情况，以及宗教信仰、民情风俗习惯等情况，以便及时对部队进行教育。
    对于群众中的“四旧”，要相信群众能够自己教育自己、自己解放自己；要积极宣传毛泽东思想，提高群众的无产阶级觉悟，让群众自觉地破资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的“四旧”，立无产阶级的“四新”。有些地方，还要尊重群众的风俗习惯，等待群众的觉悟。
    在部队离开住地时，要进行群众纪律检查，发现违犯政策纪律的现象，要及时妥善处理。对执行政策纪律好的同志要表扬，对执行政策纪律差的同志要批评。检查方法，可以逐户访问，也可以召开群众座谈会，广泛征求群众对部队的意见。对群众提出的意见要认真对待，要感谢群众的支持和帮助。（附图片）
