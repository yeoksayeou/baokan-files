The United States and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement to sign a so-called "Treaty on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space." U.S. officials admit that signing this treaty will not affect U.S. military plans.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 10th, Washington: U.S. President Johnson announced on the 8th that the United States and the Soviet Union had reached an agreement to sign a so-called "Treaty on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space." On the 9th, the U.S. delegation to the United Nations distributed the draft of the treaty, attempting to deceive other countries into supporting it, and then submit it to the current session of the United Nations General Assembly as a "joint proposal" for approval.

This is a new deal between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the so-called arms control issue at this session of the United Nations General Assembly, and it is also a new development in the process of their intensified collusion in global transactions.

According to the agreement reached at the request of the United States, the treaty superficially stipulates that the signatory countries guarantee not to place objects carrying nuclear weapons or other types of weapons of mass destruction in Earth orbit and on the Moon and other celestial bodies, or in any form in outer space. It also prohibits the establishment of military bases and facilities on celestial bodies, the testing of any type of weapon, or the conduct of military activities, and so on.

In a statement issued on the 8th, Johnson boasted that this agreement is the "most important development in arms control" since the partial nuclear test ban treaty that the U.S., the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom concluded in August 1963.

However, in reality, the provisions of this agreement are merely another trick played by U.S. imperialists in collusion with Soviet revisionists. On the day Johnson announced the agreement, the Associated Press quoted a "Department of Defense official" as saying that signing such a treaty "will have no impact on the current U.S. military plans." At the same time, "it is expected that this treaty will not prevent the United States or the Soviet Union from continuing to launch military equipment such as reconnaissance satellites, which are called 'air spies,' into space." On the same day, the U.S. News Service, in commenting on this agreement, also acknowledged that, from a military standpoint, "placing nuclear weapons in orbital satellites ... is not as effective as land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles."

This shows that, no matter how much Johnson boasts, this agreement has nothing to do with "peace" or "disarmament." However, the Soviet revisionist leadership is very eager to reach such an agreement with the United States. Johnson proposed such a suggestion on May 7 this year, and on May 30, it received a public response from the Soviet side. The two sides exchanged their respective treaty drafts for a brief discussion by the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and from September began bilateral "top-secret talks." Due to the repeated concessions made by the Soviet side, the negotiations quickly reached an agreement. The U.S. News Service commentary pointed out that "the pace of the negotiations was very rapid," which indicated the "enthusiasm of the negotiators."

The reason why the Soviet revisionists are so eager to conclude such an agreement is to cater to the needs of U.S. imperialism, to create an illusion of "peace" and "disarmament" in front of the world's people, to help the Johnson administration, which is plotting to expand the war in Vietnam, to deceive and lull the world's people; at the same time, it is also to create an atmosphere to facilitate their making more and bigger political deals with the United States to sell out the interests of the world's people on other major issues.

According to reports, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, despite the opposition of the Albanian representative, has agreed to submit the draft of the U.S.-Soviet agreement to the General Assembly. Before this, the U.S. and the Soviet Union had already colluded to manipulate the General Assembly to pass a series of proposals on the so-called arms control issue.

### 加紧全球性勾结　制造“和平”幻觉欺骗世界人民  苏美达成签订所谓和平利用外层空间条约协议  美官方人士承认签订这条约不影响美国军事计划

    加紧全球性勾结　制造“和平”幻觉欺骗世界人民
    苏美达成签订所谓和平利用外层空间条约协议
    美官方人士承认签订这条约不影响美国军事计划
    据新华社十日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊八日宣布，美国和苏联已就签订一项所谓“和平利用外层空间条约”达成协议；九日，美国驻联合国代表团散发了条约草案的文本，企图骗取其他国家的支持，然后以“联合提案”形式提交本届联合国大会通过。
    这是美苏在本届联大就所谓裁军问题作成的一笔新交易，也是两国在加紧勾结进行全球性交易过程中的一个新发展。
    根据美国的要求达成的这项协议表面上规定：缔约国保证不把载有核武器或其他种类的大规模毁灭性武器的物体放置在地球轨道上和月球及其他天体上，或以任何形式放置在外层空间，也禁止在天体上建立军事基地和设施，试验任何类型的武器，或进行军事活动，等等。
    约翰逊八日就此发表的一项声明吹嘘说，这一协议是苏美英三国一九六三年八月搞成部分禁止核试验条约那一大骗局以来“在军备监督方面的最重要的发展”。
    但是，实际上，这一协议的条文只不过是美帝国主义者伙同苏联修正主义者玩弄的又一个骗人的花招。在约翰逊宣布达成协议的当天，美联社援引美国“国防部人士”就签定这一条约发表的谈话，就清楚地暴露了这一花招的实质。谈话说：签订这样一个条约“对美国目前的军事计划将不会有什么影响”；同时，“预料这个条约也不会阻止美国或者苏联继续把称作‘空中间谍’的摄影侦察卫星之类的军用装置发射到空间去”。同一天，美新处在评论这一协议时也承认，从军事上来说，“把核武器置于轨道卫星上……不如设在陆地上的洲际导弹有效”。
    这说明，不管约翰逊吹得如何天花乱坠，这一协议同“和平”、“裁军”是毫不相干的。然而，苏联修正主义领导集团对于同美国达成这样一项协议却表现得十分起劲。约翰逊今年五月七日提出这样一项建议，五月三十日就得到了苏联方面的公开响应，苏美双方把各自的条约草案交由联合国宇宙空间委员会作短暂的讨论后，从九月份开始即转入双边“绝密会谈”，由于苏联方面一再作出让步，谈判迅速达成协议。美新处的评论指出：谈判的步调“是十分迅速的”，这表明了“会谈者的热中程度”。
    苏联修正主义者之所以如此热中于搞成这样一个协议，既是迎合美帝国主义的需要，在世界人民面前制造“和平”“裁军”的幻觉，以帮助正在策划扩大侵越战争的约翰逊政府欺骗和麻痹世界人民；同时也是为了制造气氛，便于他们就其他重大问题同美国作成更多更大的出卖世界人民利益的政治交易。
    据报道，联合国宇宙空间委员会不顾阿尔巴尼亚代表的反对，已经同意把美苏协议的条约草案提交联大；在这以前，美苏已经合谋操纵联大通过了一系列有关所谓裁军问题的提案。
