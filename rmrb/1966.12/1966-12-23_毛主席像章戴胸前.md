    Chairman Mao's badge worn on the chest,
    Li Shiming thinks of it day and night, hoping to wear a Chairman Mao badge on his chest. Today, the wish has come true, and tears of joy well up in his eyes. He bends down to take a look, turns his head to have another look. It seems like a rainbow of five colors is hanging on his chest, like a golden sun rising over the snow-capped mountains. It seems like a rainbow stretching for thousands of miles to Beijing, like Chairman Mao is by my side. Unable to contain his excitement, he shouts out a "Good!" The joyous laughter flies over the mountains! Flies over the mountains, flying straight to Chairman Mao's side. We pledge to Chairman Mao: "Border guards will resolutely follow you and march forward forever!"

    毛主席像章戴胸前
    李世鸣日日想呀夜夜盼，有枚毛主席像章戴胸前。今天愿望实现了，幸福的泪花眼中转。低下头来瞧一瞧，转过头去看一看，好像是五彩红霞胸前挂，好像是金灿灿太阳升雪山。好像是万里长虹连北京，好像毛主席就在我身边，情不自禁喊出个“好”，欢乐的笑声飞过山！飞过山呀飞过山，一直飞到毛主席身边。我们向毛主席宣誓：“边防战士坚决跟着您永向前！”
