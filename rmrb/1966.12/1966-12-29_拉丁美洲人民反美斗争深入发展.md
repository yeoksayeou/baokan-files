In the favorable situation of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries, the Latin American people have made new progress in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys over the past year. The invincible thought of Mao Zedong is spreading widely in Latin America, the revolutionary consciousness of the broad masses is constantly improving, and the revolutionary forces are growing stronger in the struggle against various enemies, including modern revisionist forces. The national democratic revolutionary movement in Latin America is developing deeply.

In recent years, as the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Latin American countries have developed, the hegemony of U.S. imperialism in this region has become increasingly shaky. Therefore, it is frantically carrying out direct armed suppression of the people's revolutionary movements in Latin America and propping up pro-American fascist regimes in more countries. Under these circumstances, the national and class contradictions in the various countries of Latin America have become increasingly sharp.

Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are also such fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people ultimately only promote a broader and more intense revolution among the people." In Latin America, the situation is exactly the same. The brutal persecution of the revolutionary forces by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys has aroused fierce resistance from the people of the various countries, especially the broad masses under the pro-American dictatorship.

In August and September this year, tens of thousands of university students across Brazil bravely and tenaciously carried out anti-American, anti-dictatorship struggles for more than a month. In March this year, workers, peasants, students, employees, housewives, and other people from all walks of life in Ecuador launched a nationwide struggle to overthrow the pro-American dictatorship, toppling the military dictatorship led by the American lackey Higinio Cueva. In Argentina, the pro-American military leader Onganía, who came to power at the end of June this year, immediately faced opposition from tens of thousands of university students and hundreds of thousands of workers, who rose up to fight against the pro-American dictatorship.

In this year, the peasants and agricultural workers in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, and the Dominican Republic have continued to launch struggles to seize land, march against hunger, and go on strike to gain land and living rights. In the northeastern part of Brazil, where peasants suffer deep misery, a greater storm of struggle is brewing.

Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct." In Latin America, more and more people realize that armed struggle is the only way for them to get rid of exploitation and slavery and achieve liberation. Many revolutionaries have taken up arms and fought bravely, one after another.

The guerrilla forces in countries such as Colombia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Peru, and Nicaragua continue to fight armed struggles in the mountains and countryside despite the enemy's repeated "encirclement and suppression," preparing for a long and arduous revolutionary war.

Of great significance is that some advanced revolutionaries have begun to accept Chairman Mao's great theory of people's war. At the same time, revolutionaries in many countries in Latin America have also realized that the main battlefield of the people's war is the countryside. Now, some guerrilla forces have begun to pay attention to mobilizing the peasants. The armed struggle forces in Venezuela that insist on armed struggle have clearly pointed out that the leadership of the armed struggle must be transferred from the cities to the mountains; students in Peru, carrying Chairman Mao's works, have gone deep into the Andean Indian regions to organize peasant associations; the guerrilla forces in Colombia, mainly composed of peasants, have used various favorable conditions to use land mines, pitfalls, and other primitive methods to deal with the government army equipped with new American bombers; some guerrilla forces in Guatemala are also conducting revolutionary propaganda among the peasants and are working to establish militias and organize peasant committees.

Chairman Mao said: "To defeat the reactionary rule of imperialism, a broad united front must be formed, and all forces that can be united, excluding the enemy, must be united to continue the arduous struggle." Now, some revolutionary organizations in Latin America have taken the establishment of such a revolutionary united front as an important task. They point out that the working class and its party must take the lead in the united front, establish a worker-peasant alliance as the basis of the united front, shift the party's work focus to the countryside, and pay attention to uniting the national bourgeoisie to participate in this line.

Chairman Mao said: "If you want a revolution, you must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party established according to Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and revolutionary style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its lackeys."

In the past year, the revolutionary forces of the various countries in Latin America have further developed and grown stronger in the fierce struggle against modern revisionism. New-type Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations have been established in more countries. This is a far-reaching event in the deepening development of the national democratic revolutionary movement in this region.

The establishment of these new-type proletarian revolutionary parties and organizations is the result of the widespread spread of Mao Zedong Thought in Latin America. The revolutionaries of Latin America regard Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful ideological weapon to guide their revolution. They say that with Mao Zedong Thought, they can undertake and accomplish the greatest historical task of the international communist movement—to drive U.S. imperialism out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and open up a new era in human history.

At the same time, they all regard the serious study and vigorous promotion of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as a central task of ideological construction.

It can be foreseen that in Latin America, which has long been under the control of U.S. imperialism, no matter what twists and turns the national democratic revolution of the peoples of the various countries may encounter, with the further widespread and in-depth spread of Mao Zedong Thought on this continent, and with the continued development and growth of the revolutionary forces on this continent, a more intense anti-American revolutionary storm will surely arise, and the national democratic revolution of the two hundred million Latin American people will surely achieve new and greater victories.

### 拉丁美洲人民反美斗争深入发展

    拉丁美洲人民反美斗争深入发展
    在世界各国人民革命斗争的大好形势下，拉丁美洲人民一年来反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争取得了新的进展。战无不胜的毛泽东思想在拉丁美洲广泛传播，广大人民的革命觉悟不断提高，革命力量在同各色各样敌人——包括现代修正主义力量斗争的过程中，日益壮大。拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动正在深入地向前发展。
    近年来，随着拉丁美洲各国人民革命斗争的发展，美帝国主义在这个地区的统治地位更加动摇，因此，它疯狂地对拉丁美洲的人民革命运动进行直接的武装镇压，在更多的国家中扶植亲美法西斯统治。在这种情况下，拉丁美洲各国的民族矛盾和阶级矛盾变得更加尖锐。
    毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”在拉丁美洲，情况也正是这样。美帝国主义及其走狗对革命力量的残酷迫害，激起了各国人民，特别是亲美独裁统治下的广大人民的激烈反抗。
    今年八、九月间，巴西全国的十几万名大学生，英勇顽强地举行了持续一个多月的反美、反独裁斗争。今年三月，厄瓜多尔的工人、农民、学生、职员、家庭妇女和其他各界人民，在全国范围内掀起了打倒亲美独裁政权的斗争怒潮，冲垮了以美国走狗希洪为首的军事独裁政权。在阿根廷，亲美军人翁加尼亚今年六月底上台以后，立即遭到几万名大学生和数十万名工人的反对，他们相继起来开展反对亲美独裁政权的斗争。
    在这一年中，巴西、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、秘鲁、阿根廷、多米尼加等国的农民和农业工人，为了获得土地和生活权利，继续不断地发动了夺地、反饥饿进军、罢工等斗争。在农民遭受深重苦难的巴西东北部，正酝酿着一场更大的斗争风暴。
    毛主席曾经指出：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”在拉丁美洲，越来越多的人认识到武装斗争是他们摆脱剥削和奴役、取得解放的唯一出路。不少革命者拿起了枪杆子，前赴后继地英勇战斗。
    哥伦比亚、委内瑞拉、危地马拉、秘鲁和尼加拉瓜等国家的游击队在敌人一次又一次的“围剿”之下，仍然在山区和农村坚持武装斗争的道路，准备进行长期而艰苦的革命战争。
    具有重大意义的是，一些先进的革命者开始接受毛主席关于人民战争的伟大理论。同时，拉丁美洲许多国家的革命者还认识到，人民战争的主要战场是农村。现在，一些游击队已经开始重视发动农民的工作。委内瑞拉坚持武装斗争的力量明确指出，必须把武装斗争的领导机构从城市转移到山区；秘鲁大学生带着毛主席的著作深入安第斯山印第安人地区，组织农会；主要由农民组成的哥伦比亚游击队利用各种有利条件，用土地雷、陷坑等土办法来对付配备有美国新式轰炸机的政府军；危地马拉一些游击队也正在农民中进行革命宣传，并着手建立民兵和组织农民委员会。
    毛主席说：“为了战胜帝国主义的反动统治，必须结成广泛的统一战线，必须团结不包括敌人在内的一切可以团结的力量，继续进行艰巨的斗争。”现在，拉丁美洲的一些革命组织已经把建立这样一种革命统一战线，作为重要的任务。它们指出，必须使工人阶级及其政党在统一战线中居于领导地位，建立工农联盟作为统一战线的基础，把党的工作重点转向农村，并注意团结民族资产阶级参加这个阵线。
    毛主席说：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”
    过去一年中，拉丁美洲各国的革命力量，在同现代修正主义的剧烈斗争中进一步发展壮大，新型的马克思列宁主义政党和组织在更多的国家里建立。这是这个地区民族民主革命运动深入发展过程中意义深远的事件。
    这些新型的无产阶级革命政党和组织的建立，是毛泽东思想在拉丁美洲广泛传播的结果。拉丁美洲的革命者，把毛泽东思想作为指导他们进行革命的强大思想武器。他们说，有了毛泽东思想，就能担负和实现国际共产主义运动最伟大的历史任务——把美帝国主义赶出亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，开创人类历史的新时代。
    同时，他们都把认真学习和努力传播马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想作为思想建设的一项中心任务。
    可以预见，在美帝国主义长期控制下的拉丁美洲，不管各国人民的民族民主革命可能出现什么样的曲折和反复，随着毛泽东思想在这个大陆的进一步广泛、深入的传播，随着这个大陆的革命力量的继续发展和壮大，必将兴起一场更为激烈的反美革命风暴，两亿拉丁美洲人民的民族民主革命必将取得新的更大的胜利。
