Recently, a moving story has been widely circulated in Japan. It passionately praises the communist spirit of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and extols the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

The story goes like this:

This June, members of the first production brigade of Lvjiazhuang in Maoyugong Commune, Jin County, Hebei Province, bought a batch of chemical fertilizer from the supply and marketing cooperative. When they opened one of the bags, they suddenly found a ladies' wristwatch between the paper and the plastic lining of the bag. From the packaging of the fertilizer, it could be seen that this bag of fertilizer was imported from Japan. They thought, the owner of this lost watch must be a Japanese citizen. The members of the new Chinese people's commune, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, immediately thought: the owner of this lost watch must be very anxious! They promptly handed the watch and the original packaging to the brigade leader to be sent to the commune party committee, suggesting that it be handed up level by level and returned to the owner.

The commune party committee sent the watch to the county, which then transferred it to the prefecture and the province. Finally, through the National Supply and Marketing Cooperative, it was determined that this batch of fertilizer had been imported from Japan in March. They then handed the watch over to the Liaozhengzhi Office in Japan, which, through the relevant Japanese-China trade authorities, conducted extensive investigations and finally found the owner of the lost watch, Matsunaga Shizuka.

Matsunaga Shizuka is a packaging worker at the Ube Kosan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant in Japan. In February of this year, while packaging fertilizer, she accidentally dropped her watch into the fertilizer bag. She searched everywhere but couldn't find it and had long since given up hope of finding it. She never imagined that half a year later, the watch would "travel" back from China. When she received the watch sent by her Chinese friends, she was deeply moved and said, "This is like a dream! I will keep this watch forever as a memento." She immediately wrote a fervent letter to our Jin County Maoyugong Commune, expressing her heartfelt thanks and highly praising the brigade members' noble character. She wished the people's commune prosperity.

This incident was reported in some Japanese newspapers under the titles "Such a Thing Happened! A Lost Item Mixed in Ammonium Sulfate Travels to China and Returns" and "A Watch Travels Back from China."

New people, new things, and new customs have emerged in Mao Zedong's new China. The story of this watch, which embodies the new customs of the Chinese people, is being praised among the broad masses of the Japanese people.

    毛泽东思想的颂歌
    ——在日本广泛流传的一个动人故事
    最近，在日本广泛流传着一个动人的故事。它热情地歌颂用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民的共产主义风格，赞扬中日两国人民的深厚情谊。
    这个故事是这样的：
    今年六月，河北省晋县马于公社吕家庄第一生产队社员，从供销社购回了一批化肥。当他们解开其中的一袋化肥时，忽然发现袋口内的牛皮纸与塑料袋之间有一只女式手表。从包装化肥的口袋上，可以看出这袋化肥是从日本进口的。他们想，丢失这只手表的主人，肯定是日本人民。用毛泽东思想武装起来的新中国人民公社社员，一事当前，首先想到的是：丢失了这只表的主人，该会多么着急呀！他们立即将这只手表同原包装袋交由生产队长送交公社党委，建议逐级上交，设法送还失主。
    公社党委把这只手表送到县，又转到专区、省，最后经全国供销合作总社查明，这批化肥，是今年三月从日本进口的。于是他们又将手表转交驻日本的廖承志办事处，通过日本的日中贸易有关方面多方调查，终于找到丢失这只手表的主人松永静江。
    松永静江，是日本宇部兴产氮肥厂的包装工人。她在今年二月包装化肥时，不小心，将手表掉在化肥包装袋内。她到处寻找，都没找着，早就以为没有找到的希望了。却万万没有想到半年之后，这只手表会从中国“旅行”归来。当她接到中国朋友送来的手表时，激动万分地说：“这真是在作梦！我要把这只手表永生地保存起来，作为纪念。”她立即写了一封热情洋溢的信给我国晋县马于公社，表示衷心的谢意，并且热烈赞扬社员这种高尚的品德，祝愿人民公社获得发展。
    这件事，日本的一些报刊分别以《竟有这种事！丢失的东西混在硫铵中去中国“旅行”归来》《手表在中国“旅行”归来》为题，作了报道。
    新人、新事、新风尚出现在毛泽东时代的新中国。体现着中国人民新风尚的这支手表的故事，正在广大日本人民中间传颂着。
