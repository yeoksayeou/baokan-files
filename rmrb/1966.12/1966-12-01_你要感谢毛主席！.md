In August of this year, one day, while the veteran of the transportation team, Li Lianyun, was on duty, a young soldier he did not recognize hurriedly walked up to him, grabbed his hand tightly and would not let go, repeatedly saying, "Old Li, I am so grateful to you. You have brought about a great change in my family's thinking."

Li Lianyun was taken aback for a moment, but immediately, as if he had seen a long-lost relative, he happily said, "You must be Cheng An!"

"Yes, yes, I am Zhang Cheng An, the comrade-in-arms you have never met."

Li Lianyun sincerely said, "You don't need to thank me. You should thank Chairman Mao! It is his teachings that have brought about a complete transformation in your family; it is also the result of your family's love for Chairman Mao and listening to his words."

The story was as follows:

Last year, Li Lianyun became the study guide for the cave team behind the barracks, focusing on Chairman Mao's works. Over time, he heard that the poor peasant and military family member, Zhang Da Ye, often quarreled with his eldest daughter-in-law. Li Lianyun thought, Zhang Da Ye is an old poor peasant and a military family member. If there are problems in their family, it will not only affect the enthusiasm of the whole family for production but also affect his son who has recently joined the army. Chairman Mao teaches us to be extremely enthusiastic towards the people. Poor and lower-middle peasants are class relatives. I cannot stand by and watch them have problems without solving them.

From then on, Li Lianyun often visited Zhang Da Ye's home, chatted with him about family matters and national affairs, and helped with the work. Gradually, Zhang Da Ye grew fond of him and regarded Li Lianyun as his most intimate person. One day, when Zhang Da Ye talked about his daughter-in-law, he sighed, "She is always in the team and does not care about the family's affairs. When she comes back, she complains about this and that."

Li Lianyun heard Zhang Da Ye's opinions and, while participating in the production team's labor, carefully observed the performance of his daughter-in-law, De Er. He saw that De Er worked well, cared for the collective, and although she spoke straightforwardly, she had not had any disputes with anyone. He asked De Er, "I see that you are good to your comrades in the team. Why do you argue with the elders as soon as you return home?"

De Er said, "The elders say I 'turn my elbows outward and care for outsiders but not insiders.' I get angry and argue with them."

Li Lianyun thought, it seems that household chores are complicated, and it is also a matter of public and private interests. If they all have a public spirit, there will be no major conflicts.

Later, Li Lianyun brought the "Three Articles" to Zhang Da Ye's home. He focused on guiding Zhang Da Ye to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," helping him eliminate the "self" character. He focused on guiding De Er to study "In Service to the People," educating her to respect her in-laws as she would revolutionary comrades, and to struggle against the old ideas of the elders with patience and persuasion.

One day, Li Lianyun told Zhang Da Ye the story of Norman Bethune and saw that Zhang Da Ye was deeply moved. He asked, "Grandpa, what do you think of Dr. Bethune?"

Zhang Da Ye said, "He is great, with no selfishness at all!"

Li Lianyun said, "Yes, if a person has no selfishness, he will eagerly do public affairs and be especially kind to comrades. Chairman Mao calls on us to learn from Bethune, which is to learn from his spirit of selflessness!"

Zhang Da Ye nodded silently. Li Lianyun continued, "We are poor and lower-middle peasants and must seriously listen to Chairman Mao's words and act on them. This is how we can repay our savior, Chairman Mao!"

At this moment, Li Lianyun could not help but talk about his own bitter family history. He talked about how his family of three generations had fled and begged for food year after year, and how his grandfather was dragged to death by the Japanese cavalry. This stirred Zhang Da Ye's class feelings. Grandpa recounted his own hardships of being a long-term laborer and begging for food in the first half of his life and said excitedly, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao, the bones of my family would have been fed to wild dogs long ago! I really don't know how to repay Chairman Mao's kindness!"

Li Lianyun replied, "We do not forget our roots by listening to Chairman Mao's words; we do as he says, and this is how we repay Chairman Mao."

Zhang Da Ye said, "Then how should I listen to Chairman Mao's words?"

Li Lianyun said, "It is to learn from Bethune's spirit of selflessness, to think of the team first in any matter, and to consider the country first. De Er doing more work for the collective is a good thing and should not be blamed or argued with. Let Grandma do more housework, so De Er can free her hands to do more for the collective, which is also Grandma doing more work for the revolution."

Zhang Da Ye, who used to get angry when someone mentioned his daughter-in-law, now thought of her hard work for the collective and felt ashamed of his past attitude. He said, "Previously, I had a hard time with De Er, mainly because my selfishness was too heavy."

Li Lianyun said, "Yes, this 'self' is the biggest harm. If a family has selfishness, the family will be in chaos; if a team has big selfishness, the team will fall behind; if a country has big selfishness, how can we build communism?"

Zhang Da Ye's mind was filled with the spirits of Bethune, Zhang Side, and the Old Fool. Not only did he no longer quarrel with his daughter-in-law, but he also devoted his heart to the collective cause. He had not gone into the paddy fields for many years due to severe arthritis. Now he thought, Bethune and Zhang Side were not afraid to die for the revolution, so how can my old bones be so delicate? He went into the paddy fields to teach the young people how to plant rice. When the team decided to implement rational dense planting, he took the lead in pulling strings to plant rice, planting it densely and evenly. When the team decided to trial-plant red flower grass, he actively participated, regardless of wind and rain, day and night, carefully managing it, making the first trial-planting of red flower grass a success. Everyone said, this old man has truly become "red in old age." De Er's relationship with her in-laws improved, and she worked even harder in the team, being elected as a women's representative. Li Lianyun also helped Zhang Da Ye write a letter to Cheng An, telling him about the changes at home and asking him to focus on studying Chairman Mao's works in the army. Cheng An, with his worries removed, studied more diligently and worked more seriously. At the beginning of this year, he was rated as one of the five good soldiers and became an active member of the team in studying Chairman Mao's works.

This time, Cheng An returned home on leave and saw the new situation at home. He asked his father why he had made such rapid progress. Zhang Da Ye was so happy that he could not close his mouth and said, "It was all thanks to the soldier Li from the Liberation Army who came to help me study! The portrait of Chairman Mao at home is the one I personally hung up, and Chairman Mao's words are the ones Li brought to my heart. Wherever Mao Zedong Thought shines, there is light!"

### “你要感谢毛主席！”

专栏：活学活用毛主席著作的故事

    “你要感谢毛主席！”
    成益　柳兵
    今年八月，有一天，运输队老战士李连云正在值日。忽然，一个陌生的青年战士兴冲冲地快步向他走来，猛地抓住他的手紧紧不放，一连声地说：“老李同志，我太感谢你了。你使我家里的人思想起了大变化。”
    李连云愣了一下，马上也像见到多年不见的亲人似的，高兴地说：
    “你是成安吧！”
      “对，对，我就是你未曾见过面的战友张成安。”
    李连云诚恳地说：“你不要感谢我，你要感谢毛主席！是他老人家的思想，使你家起了天翻地覆的变化；也是你们一家热爱毛主席、听毛主席的话的结果。”
    事情原来是这样的：
    去年，李连云担任了营房后面窑墩生产队的学习毛主席著作辅导员。时间长了，听说贫农、军属张大伯经常和他大儿媳妇吵架。李连云想，张大伯是老贫农，又是军属，他们家庭不和，不仅影响全家人的生产积极性，也会影响他那参军不久的儿子。毛主席教导我们对人民要极端热忱，贫下中农是阶级亲人，我不能看着他们有问题不去解决。
    从此，李连云就常到张大伯家，和张大伯拉家常，谈国家大事，帮助干活，张大伯渐渐地喜欢起他来，把李连云当做了最知心的人。有一天，张大伯谈到儿媳的时候，叹着气说：“她整天在队里，一点不顾家里的事。回来还嫌这不好，那不对。”
    李连云听了张大伯的意见，又在参加生产队劳动时，留心观察他儿媳妇德娥的表现。他见德娥干活很好，关心集体，说话虽是心直口快，但也没有和谁闹过纠纷。就问德娥：“我看你在队里对同志们很好，为啥一回家就和老人顶起来呢？”
    德娥说：“公公婆婆说我什么‘胳膊肘朝外，顾外不顾里’哟，我就生气，就和他们吵。”
    李连云心想，看来家务事千头万绪，也离不开为公为私的问题。要是让他们老少都一个心眼为公，就不会闹大矛盾了。
    以后，李连云就把“老三篇”送到张大伯家。着重辅导张大伯学习《纪念白求恩》，帮助他扫除一个“私”字。着重辅导德娥学习《为人民服务》，教育她要像关心革命同志那样尊重公婆，对老人的旧思想意识作斗争也要讲方式方法，耐心说服开导。
    有一天，李连云给张大伯讲白求恩的故事，看见张大伯听入了神，就启发他：“大伯，你看白求恩医生为人怎么样啊？”
    张大伯说：“太好了，人家一点私心也没有！”
    李连云说：“对，人要是没有了私心，他对公家的事就会抢着去干，对同志就会特别亲。毛主席号召我们学习白求恩，就是要学习他那毫无自私自利之心的精神啊！”
    张大伯听了默默点头。李连云又说：“我们是贫下中农，可要认真听毛主席的话，听了就照办，这才对得起我们的救星毛主席！”
    这时，李连云情不自禁地谈起自己苦难的家史，他谈到自己一家三代连年逃荒要饭，祖父被日本鬼子马队活活拖死的情景，激起了张大伯的阶级感情。大伯诉说了他前半辈子当长工和要饭的苦情后，激动地说：“要不是毛主席，我这一家人的骨头还不早喂野狗了？我真不知道怎样才能报答毛主席他老人家的恩情啊！”
    李连云回答说：“我们不忘本就是听毛主席的话；他老人家怎么说，我们就怎么办，这样做就是对毛主席的报答。”
    张大伯说：“你说我该怎样听毛主席的话呢！”
    李连云说：“就是要学习白求恩那毫无自私自利之心的精神，遇到啥事都要先替队里想，先为国家打算。德娥多为集体干活，这是好事，不应当埋怨她、和她吵架。让大妈多做些家务事，使德娥腾出手来多为集体干活，也等于大妈为革命多干了工作。”
    张大伯以前一听人提起媳妇就生气，现在想到她为集体忙累的情景，对于自己过去的态度心里感到挺惭愧。他说：“以前和德娥过不去，主要怪我的私心太重了。”
    李连云说：“对呀，这私字就是最大的祸害。一家人有私心，家里就闹翻天；一个队的人私心大，这个队准落后；要是一个国家的人私心都大，哪能建成共产主义啊！”
    张大伯心中装上了白求恩、张思德、老愚公三个人，不但不再和儿媳妇吵架，自己也把一颗红心拴到集体的事业上去了。他本来因为关节炎重，好多年不下水田了。现在他想，白求恩、张思德为革命死都不怕，我这把老骨头哪能这样娇贵呢，就下水田给小青年们传授种水稻的技术。队里要搞合理密植，他带头搞拉线插秧，插得又密又匀直。队里试种红花草，他积极参加，不分风里雨里，不管白天黑夜，精心管理，使红花草第一次试种就成功了。大家说，这老头儿可真变成“老来红”了。德娥和公婆关系好了，在家心情舒畅，在队里就干得更带劲，被选为妇女代表。李连云还给张大伯代笔把家里的变化写信告诉成安，叫他在部队安心，努力学习毛主席著作。张成安解除了后顾之忧，学习更专心，工作更认真，今年初评上五好，还成了连队的学习毛主席著作积极分子。
    张成安这次探家，看见家里的新气象，就问起爸爸为啥进步这样快。张大伯高兴得合不拢嘴说：“多亏解放军的老李来帮助我学习啊！这家里的毛主席像是我亲手挂上的，毛主席的话是老李送到我心坎上的，毛泽东思想照到哪里哪里亮啊！”
