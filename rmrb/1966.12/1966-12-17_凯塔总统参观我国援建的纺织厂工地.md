President Modibo Keita of Mali visited the construction site of the Segou Joint Textile Factory, which is being built with Chinese aid, on December 13.

Keita praised the Chinese experts for working alongside Malian workers and helping them acquire technical skills, which has accelerated the progress of the project.

Keita inspected the factory buildings and the auxiliary projects under construction. He happily remarked, "Last December, I passed through here, and the project had not yet begun. Now, the work is proceeding very smoothly."

Accompanying Keita on the visit were Jean-Marie Koné, the Minister of State for Planning, Economic Coordination, and Financial Affairs, and Mamadou Gologo, the Minister of Information and Tourism.
