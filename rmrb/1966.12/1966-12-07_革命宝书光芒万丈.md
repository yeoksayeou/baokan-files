The Chinese people are studying Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionary people of the world are also studying Chairman Mao's works. In the newspapers, we often see the moving examples of revolutionary people from various countries eagerly studying Chairman Mao's works:

In South Vietnam, soldiers are diligently studying Chairman Mao's works on the battlefield amidst the chaos of war. They say: Chairman Mao's books have strengthened their fighting spirit and encouraged them to strike back even harder against the American aggressors.

In the Congo (Leopoldville), guerrilla fighters risk their lives, crossing through layers of enemy blockades to bring Chairman Mao's works into the guerrilla zones. They say: Chairman Mao's books have given them boundless strength in their struggle, instilling in them the resolve to fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.

In Venezuela, a revolutionary youth, arrested by the reactionary government backed by American imperialism, managed to have Chairman Mao's works smuggled into the prison, organizing fellow prisoners to study them. They want to arm their minds with Chairman Mao's books to prepare for future struggles.

The world's revolutionary people love Chairman Mao's works, which is a great encouragement and a great spur to us. It is Chairman Mao who led the Chinese people to victory in the revolution. It is Chairman Mao who guided us poor and lower-middle peasants step by step onto the happy path of the people's commune. From our personal experience, we deeply understand: only by following Chairman Mao's words can the Chinese people advance from victory to victory. Therefore, we enthusiastically respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, achieving the goal of "carrying Chairman Mao's works with us at all times and studying them at any time and in any place." Moreover, we pay special attention to applying what we learn, using Chairman Mao's words as the guiding principles for all our actions.

Seeing our class brothers abroad studying Chairman Mao's works with such strong revolutionary feelings, we further realize: Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth applicable everywhere. Chairman Mao's books are not only the revolutionary treasure for the Chinese people but also for the people of the world. We are Chinese peasants living in the shadow of Chairman Mao, and we must redouble our efforts to study Chairman Mao's books and truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat, with a population of 700 million. We need a unified thought, a revolutionary thought, a correct thought, and that is Mao Zedong Thought. With this thought, we can maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit and have a firm and correct political direction." We are glad to see that the revolutionary people of the world love Chairman Mao's works and have unwavering faith in Mao Zedong Thought. Under the great Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of the world will surely maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit and a correct political direction, fight against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and sweep away all the harmful elements in the world.

    革命宝书光芒万丈
    中国人民在大学毛主席著作。全世界革命人民也都在大学毛主席著作。在报纸上，我们经常看到各国革命人民如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作的动人事例：
    在南越，战士们在战火纷飞的战场上刻苦地学习毛主席著作。他们说：毛主席的书增强了他们的斗争勇气，鼓舞他们更有力地打击美国侵略者。
    在刚果（利），游击队员们冒着生命危险，穿过敌人的层层封锁，把毛主席著作带进游击区。他们说：毛主席的书使他们在斗争中得到了无穷的力量，树立了不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利的决心。
    在委内瑞拉，一位革命青年被美帝国主义扶植的反动政府逮捕后，千方百计地托人把毛主席著作带进监狱，组织难友进行学习。他们要用毛主席的书武装自己的头脑，迎接未来的斗争。
    世界革命人民热爱毛主席著作，对我们是莫大的鼓舞，也是莫大的鞭策。是毛主席，领导我们中国人民取得了革命的胜利。是毛主席，指引我们贫下中农逐步走上人民公社的幸福大道。我们从切身体会中深深懂得：只有听毛主席的话，中国人民才能从胜利走向胜利。因此，我们热烈响应林彪副主席的号召，努力学习毛主席著作，做到“毛主席著作随身带，随时随地学起来”。而且，我们特别注意活学活用，把毛主席的话作为一切行动的指导方针。
    看到国外的阶级弟兄怀着强烈的革命感情学习毛主席著作，我们进一步认识到：毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。毛主席的书不仅是中国人民的革命宝书，也是世界人民的革命宝书。我们是生活在毛主席身边的中国农民，一定要百倍努力把毛主席的书学好，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。
    林彪同志说：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。有了这个思想，才能保持旺盛的革命干劲，才有坚定正确的政治方向。”我们高兴地看到，全世界革命人民是这样无限热爱毛主席著作，无限信仰毛泽东思想。在伟大的毛泽东思想的武装下，世界革命人民也一定能保持旺盛的革命干劲，坚持正确的政治方向，同帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派进行斗争，把世界上一切害人虫扫除干净。
