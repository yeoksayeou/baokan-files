	Hundreds of millions of military and civilian people warmly celebrate our country's new nuclear explosion achievement
	Hail Chairman Mao leading us from victory to new victory
	Determined in the new year to raise higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works extensively, to resolutely carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, to seize new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to welcome a new upsurge in socialist construction.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 30th, in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at a time when the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved major victories, the news of our country's successful new nuclear explosion has greatly inspired the hundreds of millions of people across the nation. Revolutionary masses across the country have expressed that in the new year, they will raise higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works extensively, resolutely carry out and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and fight against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and monsters in society. They will seize new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, welcome a new upsurge in socialist construction, and contribute greater strength in supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war and the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.

	In the past two days, major cities across the country, as well as many small cities, industrial areas, and rural areas, have seen revolutionary masses in high spirits, holding extensive celebrations and parades. Countless letters of congratulations, resolutions, and telegrams have flown like snowflakes to the Party Central Committee and the State Council, as well as to local leadership organs. The entire nation is in a festive mood, with people joyfully shouting: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" "Long live, ten thousand times long live, our great leader Chairman Mao!"

	Revolutionary masses in cities such as Wuhan, Nanning, Changsha, and Zhengzhou in the Central-South region pointed out during their celebrations of victory that the news of the successful new nuclear explosion has further inspired the Chinese people's fighting spirit. Revolutionary workers and commune members from the suburbs of Wuhan braved the rare severe cold of many years to hold celebratory parades. Many revolutionary workers and commune members expressed their determination to learn from the comrades who participated in the nuclear test, follow the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. They will deepen and thoroughly carry out the Cultural Revolution in factories and rural areas. The young Red Guards of Wuhan said that at this time of celebrating victory, we must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! We will ensure that our country will never change color, which is the most fundamental war preparedness and the fundamental guarantee for our support of the world revolution. Workers and peasants in the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, expressed their determination to study the "Three Articles" as their guiding principles, to carry out ideological revolutionization, to promote production while carrying out the revolution, to support national construction, and to support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-American national salvation war to the end.

	The joyous news spread like spring breeze throughout the cities and rural areas of the East China region, including Fuzhou, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Jinan, Nanjing, and Hefei, creating a scene of extremely enthusiastic celebration. In the coastal defense city of Fuzhou, revolutionary masses held grand celebratory meetings and parades, expressing their determination to be a hundred times more vigilant and ready to annihilate any enemy that dares to invade. In the heroic city of Nanchang, broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and young Red Guards expressed their determination to take the comrades who participated in the nuclear weapons test as their examples, to be ambitious and resolute, to study Chairman Mao's works extensively, to apply Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out a thorough revolution in their souls, to break down private interests and establish public interests, and to actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The news of victory spread like spring wind throughout the cities and villages of North China, with the broad masses holding grand celebratory meetings and parades, filled with deep affection for our great leader Chairman Mao. Red Guards from many schools in Tianjin expressed that Mao Zedong Thought is the source of all our victories. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, care about state affairs, and swear to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We will thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. Workers of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company resolved to learn from the comrades who participated in this nuclear explosion test, to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the new year, to better grasp the revolution and promote production, seizing new victories.

	In the cities of Harbin, Changchun, and Anshan in the Northeast region, people braved temperatures of minus twenty degrees to paste joyous bulletins on the streets at night and parade in groups. Revolutionary workers of the First Automobile Works in Changchun expressed their determination to follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao and, in the new year, to seize double victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production. Revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel unanimously expressed their determination to learn from all the comrades who participated in the nuclear test, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to be ambitious and resolute, to grasp the revolution and promote production, to overcome all difficulties, and to shoulder heavy responsibilities for the construction of our motherland.

	Throughout the vast lands of Southwest China, from cities to border areas, people are celebrating the new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. In Chongqing, tens of thousands of revolutionary workers held a parade lasting five to six hours, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and red flags. Workers expressed their determination to better use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldviews and to run their enterprises as great schools of Mao Zedong Thought. In Guiyang, many young Red Guards, upon hearing the news, took to the streets with drums and gongs, celebrating this great joy for the revolutionary people of the world. In the border city of Kunming, many young Red Guards, upon hearing the news, went to the streets and rural areas to spread the word.

	In the past two days, the cold Northwest Plateau has been hot with excitement. In the Yumen Oil Field, revolutionary workers have been writing big-character posters and holding celebratory meetings. Workers said that we develop nuclear weapons precisely to eliminate nuclear weapons. We will never be the first to use nuclear weapons, but if the enemy dares to start a nuclear war, we will fight to the end. Zhang Pengya, a Chinese student recently ordered back to China by the Soviet government, was excited to hear the news in Lanzhou: "This great victory has greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and has greatly dampened the arrogance of American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and all reactionaries." In Yinchuan, broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants held meetings, joyfully shouting: "Long live, ten thousand times long live, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!" In the plateau city of Xining, people of various ethnic groups also held celebratory parades.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 30th, from the moment the radio broadcast the great news that our country had successfully conducted a new nuclear explosion, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army were immersed in boundless excitement and joy, with drums and firecrackers echoing everywhere, presenting a scene of great rejoicing. Soldiers and officers cheered, jumped, and sang joyfully, hailing this as another triumphant song of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought resonating through the clouds, singing praises to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, who leads the Chinese people to scale one peak after another, from victory to new and greater victories.

	Units of the Kunming-based troops stationed in the southwestern border of the motherland, from headquarters to companies, from camps to border outposts, held celebratory meetings, discussions, wrote articles, put up wall newspapers, and performed programs, enthusiastically hailing the new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and praising the new achievements of the Cultural Revolution. Soldiers and officers of a communication company on a certain island in the front line of Fujian performed and propagated among the local fishermen. Soldiers and officers of the "Hard-Boned Sixth Company" of the Wuhan-based troops were overjoyed upon hearing this inspiring news. They proudly read aloud Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." Recently, the pilots of a certain unit of the naval air force, who were awarded the title of "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment," braved the cold winter wind and held a celebratory meeting on the tarmac, celebrating this great victory.

	Soldiers and officers of various units enthusiastically hailed that the victory of the new nuclear explosion is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a new fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. Soldiers and officers said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "Humanity must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress." "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." Comrades engaged in the research and testing of nuclear weapons have precisely followed Chairman Mao's teachings and, within this year, successfully conducted three nuclear tests, thus raising the scientific and technological level of our country's nuclear weapons to a new level. Thousands of victories, tens of thousands of victories, are all great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The victory belongs to our most, most great leader Chairman Mao. Soldiers and officers of the "Red Ninth Company," a model company for studying Chairman Mao's works in the entire army, enthusiastically said that our era is the most great era of Mao Zedong, an era of heroes emerging in droves, miracles happening frequently, and scaling world peaks. Our country's successful conduct of three nuclear tests in one year most eloquently, most profoundly, and most powerfully demonstrates that Mao Zedong Thought is a great treasure for understanding everything, mastering everything, transforming everything, and promoting everything.

	Many soldiers and officers expressed in discussions and debates that they are determined to take the comrades who participated in the research and testing of nuclear weapons as their examples and, in the new year that is about to come, to raise higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to continue to emphasize proletarian politics, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to establish a communist worldview of selflessness, to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.
