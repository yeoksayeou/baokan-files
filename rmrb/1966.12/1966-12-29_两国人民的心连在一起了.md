This year, a Chinese youth delegation consisting of four people visited the Congo (Brazzaville) for a performance tour. The solo dance "Song of the Slaves" depicts the struggle of Tibetan serfs under the leadership of the Communist Party of China to gain liberation. When the performer angrily smashes the symbolic shackles in their hands and dances with joy, the audience often excitedly shouts, "Just like us Africans, we are finally free." During the performance of the duo dance "Bow Dance," the audience would stick out their thumbs in approval, and some would say, "Just like when we fight the colonial devils." Some audience members said that the performance by the Chinese artists has united the hearts of the Chinese and Congolese peoples.

    两国人民的心连在一起了
    今年中国青年代表团一个由四个人组成的演出小组到刚果（布）访问演出。单人舞蹈《奴隶之歌》描写了西藏农奴在中国共产党领导下获得解放的斗争。当演员在演出中愤怒地砸碎手上象征性的镣铐而欢舞时，观众们常常激动地喊叫：“正像我们非洲人一样，终于自由了。”在演出双人舞《弓舞》时，观众就伸出大拇指叫好，有的还说：“就像我们打殖民鬼子一样。”有的观众就说，中国艺术家的演出，使中刚两国人民的心连在一起了。
