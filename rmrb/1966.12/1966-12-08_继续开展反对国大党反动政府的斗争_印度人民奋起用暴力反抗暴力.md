New Delhi, December 7 (Xinhua) - Teachers, students, and workers in India, despite the brutal suppression by the reactionary government of the Indian National Congress, continue to stage anti-government protests.

According to Indian newspapers, on December 5, 2,000 middle school teachers in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, defied the government's ban on demonstrations and held a protest in front of the municipal council, demanding improved wages and working conditions for teachers.

It is reported that the teachers have been conducting their struggle through a hunger strike in batches for 61 days. The state government refused to meet their demands, forcing them to hold protests to express their grievances.

The Indian National Congress government brutally suppressed their protest, arresting 44 teachers.

According to the *Indian Express*, on December 5, students in Bikaner, Rajasthan, held a protest outside the local government building. The reactionary government sent police to fire tear gas and beat the students. The students, forced to resist violence with violence, used stones as weapons and bravely fought the police, and attacked the local government building. All schools and cinemas in the city went on strike to show sympathy and support for the protesting students. The entire city was paralyzed.

All four colleges in Bikaner have been on strike since November 22. The Rajasthan government ordered the closure of two colleges on December 5 to suppress the student movement.

Workers at New Delhi Railway Station held a protest on November 23 to oppose the illegal arrest of three workers by the police.

In Chingleput District, Madras, on the night of December 4, when a police unit supposedly "anti-smuggling" chased a truck in a police car, many people threw stones at the police, damaging the police car.

Unable to bear the reactionary rule of the Indian National Congress, the Indian people have been staging continuous anti-government protests in recent days. This is a scene of students and military police facing off in New Delhi. (Photo by Xinhua)

    比卡内尔市所有四所专科学院的学生自十一月二十二日以来，一直举行罢课。拉贾斯坦政府五日已下令关闭两所学院来镇压学生斗争。
    新德里火车站职工十一月二十三日为抗议警察非法逮捕三名职工进行了示威。
