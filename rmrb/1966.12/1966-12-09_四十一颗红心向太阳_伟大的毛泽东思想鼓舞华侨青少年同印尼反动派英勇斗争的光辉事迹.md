In the stormy island nation, in the black dungeon of the Sumatran base command in North Sumatra, the revolutionary spirit overflowed. The heroic song of the young patriots often burst out from the iron-wire-covered windows:

"We are the overseas children of the Chinese nation, the youth of the Mao Zedong era. We fight alongside the Indonesian people, and now in prison, we continue our unyielding struggle. Chairman Mao! You are the red sun in our hearts. To follow your teachings, we solemnly vow: We will use our beautiful youth and our own blood to defend the honor of our motherland! We will defend the dignity of our motherland to the death!"

This was the battle song sung by forty-one overseas Chinese youth in the dark and terrifying foreign prison. This group, which held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, these overseas Chinese male and female youths with an average age of only nineteen, fought bravely for forty days in prison against the savage Indonesian fascist soldiers. They relied on Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful ideological weapon, to overcome the enemy's brutal torture and secret interrogations, shattering the political persecution plots of the Indonesian reactionaries, and defending the dignity of the motherland with their blood, upholding national dignity. Now, they have returned to the motherland victorious, singing the triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought.

Singing the Battle Song to Welcome the Struggle

On October 10, 1966, when the Indonesian reactionaries launched a larger-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese frenzy, the sound of guns firing to suppress patriotic overseas Chinese echoed through the streets of Medan.

That afternoon at around two o'clock, the Medan military authorities, in order to sabotage the work of the Chinese government in repatriating willing overseas Chinese victims, to extinguish the flames of resistance against persecution by the victims, and also to obtain propaganda materials for their American masters that they had not yet obtained, sent a group of Indonesian reactionary officers and plainclothes spies to the "refugee camp" of the Medan Overseas Chinese School, under the pretext of "inspecting hygiene," to forcibly take humiliating photographs of the refugees.

The overseas Chinese children of the Mao Zedong era would not tolerate the imperialists and their running dogs to do as they pleased! The refugees linked arms and stood shoulder to shoulder, surrounding the two Indonesian captains who came under the guise of "inspecting hygiene" — Datuk Ahda Be and Lanli Margan — and the two Indonesian plainclothes spies, shouting at them with thunderous voices:

"No photographs!"

"Hand over the negatives!"

"Get out, you American imperialist running dogs!"

The terrified Datuk captain drew his pistol and shouted hoarsely, "If you don't disperse, I'll shoot!"

"Bang! Bang!..." The reactionary soldiers guarding the "refugee camp" fired shots to suppress them!

But the gunshots could not intimidate the patriotic overseas Chinese armed with Mao Zedong Thought! The roar of "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" and the song "Unity Is Strength" drowned out the gunshots. The refugees, facing the bullets whizzing over their heads, tightened their encirclement. The sweating Indonesian reactionary officers and spies, relying on the reactionary soldiers to clear a path with their rifle butts, fled in disarray.

An hour later, two cars sped towards the "refugee camp." Soldiers in green and camouflage uniforms, wearing steel helmets, shouted and rushed into the "camp," forcibly taking away eight young men. Near the dormitories, a group of thugs who had followed the soldiers surrounded and beat up another overseas Chinese youth, then handed him over to the soldiers for arrest. This gang of fascist bandits, as they took the nine overseas Chinese youths away from the "camp," still crazily threatened to arrest all the refugees who had participated in stopping the photographs!

A new attack was imminent. A group of calm and composed overseas Chinese youths hurriedly took a bath and changed their clothes, then sat together and read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations:

"Resolve to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

"To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai; to die for the fascists, to work for those who exploit and oppress the people, is lighter than a feather."

Suddenly, the sound of car engines and the clatter of military boots echoed from below. When a large group of armed soldiers appeared in the "camp," the overseas Chinese youths who had always stood at the forefront of the anti-persecution struggle, one by one, stepped forward and shouted, "It was us who protested against your photographs! We protested against your insults to our compatriots, and it was a completely just action. You have no right to arrest us!"

The savage fascist soldiers swung their rifle butts and fists, howling as they pushed into the crowd, pulling out thirty-two youths and pushing them towards the prison van.

Even a fifteen-year-old and a thirteen-year-old overseas Chinese youth were not spared, and they were also taken away. The two youths, thinking of the many revolutionary stories their elder brothers and sisters had told them, tightly held their elder brothers' and sisters' hands and said solemnly, "We are not afraid of anything!"

When the forty-one youths were taken in two batches to the Medan base command, they alternately recited Chairman Mao's quotations on the prison van: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no great power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." They also sang songs like "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helm" and "We Walk on the Great Road." A reactionary newspaper in Medan could not help but admit that these overseas Chinese youths were "singing marching songs repeatedly, shouting Mao Zedong's name," as they were taken to the Medan base command.

Yes, our heroic overseas Chinese youths felt at that moment that they were not going to prison but were marching to the battlefield of international class struggle, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Faces Unchanged, Hearts Unshaken

The Medan base command was filled with a murderous atmosphere. Machine guns were set up around the grassy area in the courtyard, and a group of heartless executioners stood there.

The heroic youths had already put life and death aside, and at this moment, they only felt Chairman Mao's teachings resonating in their ears. They faced the savage fascist soldiers, each one standing tall and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

The Indonesian reactionaries, who had slaughtered countless Indonesian people, attempted to use fascist violence to make the overseas Chinese youths submit. A group of armed soldiers, like mad beasts, pounced on the youths. They took turns hitting the youths' heads with their steel helmets, striking their knee joints with rifle butts, whipping their cheeks with ammunition belts, and kicking their abdomens and waists with boots. Eighteen-year-old Li Jinxin was beaten until his face was covered in blood and he collapsed to the ground. The enemy then stomped on his waist with their boots. Twenty-year-old Yu Yazhou had his temples beaten until his skin split and blood gushed out. Nineteen-year-old Zheng Xiancai was punched until her face was swollen. Twenty-one-year-old Guo Lihua collapsed to the ground in pain after being kicked in the abdomen. Wu Zhao'an, Huang Shuncai, Qiu Yuehao, Xie Wentian, Zhang Liangming, and others were beaten until they could not stand on their legs, had bleeding heads, or were covered in wounds.

"Quick! Who assassinated the Datuk captain?" the right-wing soldiers shouted, asking such a ridiculous question and interrogating each of the forty-one youths under torture.

The forty-one unyielding overseas Chinese youths clenched their teeth and fists, shouting protests: "Shameless! You are lying! Your beating us is illegal, and we strongly protest!"

Seeing that torture was ineffective, a leader named Samin Darigan drew his pistol and pointed it at Yu Yazhou, shouting, "Aren't you afraid of death?!" The reactionary soldiers all raised their guns, loading the bullets into the chambers.

Young Yu Yazhou, who had lost his parents at a young age and supported himself through work to study, had often transcribed Chairman Mao's quotations from the broadcasts of the motherland's radio station and copied them for his classmates to study. In his diary the day before his arrest, he wrote: "Chairman Mao said, reactionary things, if you don't fight them, they won't fall. They bully the weak and fear the strong, which is the nature of all reactionaries. As long as we stand tall, chest out, and glare at them, facing them head-on and daring to fight, and persist, the reactionaries who bully the weak and fear the strong can be completely defeated."

At this moment, facing the enemy's gun barrel, Yu Yazhou tore open his shirt, stood tall, and shouted, "If you have the guts, shoot!" The youths all linked arms and shoulders, standing tall and shouting at the enemy, "You dogs! Come on, shoot here!"

The paper tiger was exposed! The leader named Samin Darigan was so frightened by our young warriors that he retreated, and several bullets fell from his ammunition belt to the ground. The other right-wing soldiers also lowered their guns.

But the enemy did not give up. That night, as the darkness enveloped the terrifying prison, the torture continued.

In a small cell, the enemy took turns beating Qiu Yuehao and Zheng Xiancai. The right-wing soldiers struck twenty-year-old Qiu Yuehao with a baton, and Zheng Xiancai immediately rushed over to protect him with her body. The enemy kicked Zheng Xiancai's abdomen, and Qiu Yuehao rushed over to shield her. They protected each other like this, sharing the pain.

Midnight, a right-wing soldier named Samisir rushed into the cell where Yu Yazhou was being held alone, and viciously raised his rifle butt, striking Yu Yazhou's head, which had already been severely injured during the day. Yu Yazhou's head was split open again, and blood spurted out. At this moment, Yu Yazhou was still unyielding, standing tall and cursing the enemy with gritted teeth.

It was deep into the night, and Yu Yazhou was tortured by the pain, unable to sleep for a long time. At this moment, he seemed to hear the voices of his comrades: "Yazhou! Think of Chairman Mao, think of the motherland, and you will be full of strength!" He endured the pain and used his right hand to dip in his own blood on his head, writing five bright red words on the prison wall:

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

A Fortress of Unity and Struggle

The day after the forty-one youths were arrested—October 11—early in the morning, a group of armed soldiers drove eleven female youths out of the prison. A plainclothes spy with a face full of horizontal meat stood on the grass, raised his camera, and tried to take photographs again.

The female youths immediately saw through the enemy's plot. Zheng Xiancai shouted angrily, "Classmates, drive away the American running dogs! Don't let them take photographs!" The female youths covered their faces and turned their backs, firmly refusing to let the enemy take photographs.

A right-wing officer rushed up and slapped Zheng Xiancai's face twice. Ten female youths protected Zheng Xiancai in the middle, enduring the enemy's whips, rifle butts, and kicks, but they could not be separated.

"Don't hit women! Don't hit women! Protest against fascist atrocities!" The male youths locked in nearby cells also shouted angrily from the windows.

The enemy hurriedly pushed the eleven female youths back into the female prison, then rushed to the male prison. They took turns crazily beating the male youths. But no matter how the enemy beat them, the roar of "Down with American imperialist running dogs!" still shook the entire Medan base command.

The enemy's provocation was shattered again! The female youths wrote in their prison diary that day: "This storm has passed, but a bigger storm may follow. Come on! Reactionary things, the more you come, the better, we will swallow you one by one!"

On the third day of their imprisonment—October 12—the forty-one youths launched a counterattack against the crazed persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries. That morning, the female prison echoed with the sound of struggle. They sang a song of unity and struggle to the tune of "We Walk on the Great Road":

"We are not criminals, but we are unjustly imprisoned in this prison to uphold national dignity. Torture cannot intimidate us. Forward! Forward! For the liberation of mankind, forward! Forward! Towards victory!"

"The great teachings of Chairman Mao: Resolve to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory. Victory will surely be ours. Forward! Forward! For the liberation of mankind, forward! Forward! Towards victory!"

The female youths had just practiced their newly composed song when the refugee representatives came to the base command to negotiate. The eleven female youths rushed out of the prison, singing "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helm" and their newly composed battle song, and shouting to the refugee representatives who were negotiating with the Indonesian authorities:

"Uphold national dignity!"

"The dignity of the motherland cannot be insulted!"

"The truth is in our hands!"

"We have a great motherland as our support!"

"We have seven hundred million compatriots as our backing!"

"Victory will surely be ours!"

The male youths locked in the prison also crowded to the iron-wire windows, singing and shouting! The shouts and songs of the male and female youths echoed each other, forming a powerful demonstration against the Indonesian reactionaries. The refugee representatives saw the youths' fighting spirit in prison, giving them thumbs up and nodding in praise.

The reactionary leaders of the base command were terrified by this scene, and the commander of the Medan base, Languda, personally took charge, dispatching troops. More than fifty fully armed soldiers arrived, surrounding the eleven female youths, trying to drag Zheng Xiancai out. The female youths linked arms, protecting Zheng Xiancai in the middle. At this moment, fists and whips rained down on the female youths' heads and bodies.

"Stop! I'll come out! See what you can do to me!" Zheng Xiancai, seeing her comrades beaten for protecting her, stepped out of the protective circle.

The enemy locked Zheng Xiancai in a separate small cell. Zheng Xiancai, this steadfast overseas Chinese female youth, had participated in organizing literacy classes in the "refugee camp," often telling revolutionary stories and teaching revolutionary songs to the refugee children, and was a brave and collective-loving good youth. Now, facing a group of fascist bandits, she felt a strong anger in her heart. She clenched her fists and cursed, "Shameless dogs! American imperialist running dogs! Get out! All of you get out!" The other female youths simultaneously shouted in another room, "American imperialist running dogs! Get out! Get out!"

The female youths finally drove away the beasts. Then, they unlocked the cell where Zheng Xiancai was held and rescued their comrade.

Six Days of Hunger Strike

The forty-one overseas Chinese youths decided on the day of their arrest to prepare for a life-and-death struggle against the savage Indonesian reactionaries according to Chairman Mao's teachings. On the second day of their imprisonment, in the morning, they cleverly contacted each other and unanimously announced the start of a hunger strike. They solemnly demanded of the military authorities: immediately stop the torture, immediately send the injured comrades to the hospital for treatment, and must declare all of them innocent and release them.

One day passed, then another. The youths, whose bodies were severely damaged, saw their strength rapidly declining. But this fighting collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought had an even stronger fighting spirit and fighting power. In the male and female prisons, the youths, relying on their memory, recited Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again:

"Our comrades must see achievements and light in difficult times and raise our courage."

"We all come from the four seas and the five lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together. All our comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other."

In the hot male prison, under the dim light, twenty-year-old Cai Qianglin fanned away the heat and mosquitoes for his comrades, fanning until his comrades fell asleep, and then he slept. Sometimes, he would light a candle in the middle of the night, walk around his comrades to catch bedbugs, so that his comrades could sleep more peacefully. Most of his comrades slept on the concrete floor without mats, and some developed edema. He let the comrades with edema sleep on the few wooden planks, while he slept on the concrete floor. This youth from a poor family, who had completed junior high school by working part-time, wrote on the prison wall the battle call of Chairman Mao: "Resolve to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

Chairman Mao's words illuminated the dark prison, guiding this group of overseas heroes to fight from night to dawn.

The hunger strike entered its fourth day. The youths' strength was weakening, and everyone took turns caring for the seriously injured comrades, supporting each other to the toilet. On that dawn, they sang a battle poem they collectively created, expressing their boundless revolutionary spirit, their boundless love for the most beloved great leader Mao Zedong and the great motherland, and their boundless loyalty to the great Mao Zedong Thought. They sang:

"Motherland! You are our strongest support,
To defend your dignity, we are fighting a heroic hunger strike.
When hunger tortures us endlessly,
I think of you,
All suffering disappears.
Chairman Mao! You are the red sun in our hearts,
To follow your teachings, we are fighting face to face with the enemy.
When our bodies are beaten,
I think of you,
The pain in our bodies is completely gone!"

During the most difficult time of the hunger strike, the youths became more and more anxious about two young comrades in their fighting collective—thirteen-year-old Liao Shengchang and fifteen-year-old Zheng Tian Shu. These two youths, who had bravely driven away the American imperialists and Kuomintang spies in the "refugee camp," although they were emaciated by hunger, they always fought alongside their elder brothers and sisters, and never wavered.

The Indonesian reactionaries were terrified by the youths' hunger strike. They repeatedly sent officers and spies to the prison to threaten and bribe the youths, attempting to sabotage the hunger strike. But they always received a chorus of angry shouts: "Shameless running dogs! Get out! Get out!"

In the face of our fearless youth heroes, the Indonesian reactionaries retreated again. On October 16, the sixth day of the hunger strike, the Medan military authorities were forced to agree to treat the injured and sick youths and stop the torture. The hunger strike achieved a decisive victory, and the youths resumed eating on October 17, preparing for the new struggle.

Debating with Fascist Bandits

The strong protest of the Chinese government against the detention of forty-one overseas Chinese youths by the Indonesian reactionaries made the enemy tremble. The second repatriation ship, the Guanghua, was about to arrive at Wura Port, making the reactionary leaders of the Medan military authorities restless. The desperate base command leaders held meetings day and night, looking for a way out.

Individual interrogations began. The enemy hoped to use this fascist psychological warfare to break through the impregnable steel fortress and force the youths to submit.

The heroic overseas Chinese youths found the weapon of struggle in the works of Chairman Mao: strategically, we must despise all enemies, and tactically, we must take all enemies seriously. They had long been prepared to deal with secret interrogations to shatter the enemy's plots at any time.

One day, Yu Yazhou was taken to the interrogation room. An officer sat there, acting arrogant, and as soon as he saw Yu Yazhou, he slammed the table and shouted, "You are the leader! If you don't reveal the internal situation, you will be sentenced to life imprisonment!"

"You have no right to judge us! You want to sentence us, the Indonesian people will not agree! You say I am the leader, where is the evidence!" Yu Yazhou had long anticipated the enemy's move and immediately gave the enemy a stern rebuke.

The officer's face twitched, and suddenly he smiled and offered Yu Yazhou tea and cigarettes. Then, the officer ran to another room and whispered with his superior before coming back out.

"Are you here voluntarily? Or were you arrested?"

Yu Yazhou thought the enemy had brought out some new trick, and now hearing the enemy ask such a clumsy question, he almost laughed out loud and took the opportunity to attack the enemy: "I was illegally arrested by you! And I was severely tortured!"

"Why did you go on a hunger strike! Who is leading it?"

The enemy's plot was exposed. Yu Yazhou pressed the enemy: "We are completely innocent. We went on a hunger strike to protest against your illegal arrest and torture, and we do not need anyone to lead us!"

In the face of righteous condemnation, the enemy was speechless.

The enemy then used their usual fascist trickery. An officer, during the interrogation of twenty-year-old Qiu Yuehao, pretended to be calm and said, "Your friend has told us, you are the leader!"

Our heroic youths are an indestructible, united fighting collective! Qiu Yuehao, full of confidence, saw the enemy playing such a clumsy political trick and deliberately countered the enemy: "If someone says so, let them come out and testify!" The right-wing officer was struck dumb for a long time. The brave and alert Qiu Yuehao immediately took the initiative and reproached the enemy: "You provoke our compatriots, take photographs without our permission, it is an insult to our motherland and compatriots, a political plot, we cannot tolerate you doing this!"

The enemy was at a loss in front of our heroic young warriors and quickly made a U-turn: "Do you have any other requests?"

"Release us immediately! Compensate for all losses!" Qiu Yuehao gave the enemy another heavy blow.

The enemy then interrogated four more youths. They recorded a large number of "confessions," but they got nothing. During the interrogation of Zheng Xiancai, an officer, helpless and frustrated, said, "You people are really tough! There are Red Guards on the Chinese mainland, perhaps there are Red Guards in Indonesia, perhaps there are Red Guards in Medan, are you all Red Guards?"

Zheng Xiancai proudly said to the enemy, "You are so afraid of the Red Guards, which shows that our Red Guards are right! If I can become a Red Guard in the future, I would be very happy!"

The enemy's illegal interrogations failed, one after another.

The Source of Victory

What power supported the unarmed overseas children to fight unyieldingly against the savage fascist enemies? What power inspired them to sacrifice everything to strive for victory? Our forty-one young heroes answered this question with their moving struggle: This is the great Mao Zedong Thought, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

On November 16, 1966, two days before our young heroes were to be released from prison, they wrote a letter to our great leader Mao Zedong from prison. People can see from this letter that although our young heroes were overseas, because the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated and nurtured them, they could stand like pine trees in the storm.

They wrote in the letter to Chairman Mao:

"From the moment we were arrested, we used Chairman Mao's teachings to encourage and inspire each other. In the struggle, we deeply felt the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. In the dark prison cells patrolled by the enemy, comrades relied on their memory to recite Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again. Although we were in the dark and terrifying prison, the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated our hearts."

"We promise Chairman Mao: We will continue to use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon and achieve final victory in this international class struggle!"

Our youths showed how deeply loyal they were to Mao Zedong Thought, and how they drew boundless inspiration from Mao Zedong Thought. This can be best illustrated by the following story.

This was the day after the youths won the hunger strike. At noon, the refugees outside the prison sent a folded note to their comrades inside.

"Is it a letter? Or what?" The youths slowly unfolded the note, their hearts pounding, and they couldn't help but cheer softly:

"It's Chairman Mao's article!"

"It's the spiritual weapon we need most!"

The note contained the complete text of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," which was the most precious gift from the overseas Chinese outside the prison to their comrades inside.

In the foreign prison, in one round of struggle after another, the youths, relying on their memory, recited Chairman Mao's quotations together, guiding their struggle. Now, they had obtained the "In Memory of Norman Bethune" that shone with boundless light, how could they not be excited!

To avoid the enemy's search, and more importantly, to deeply imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in their minds, the comrades gave Yu Yazhou, Wang Jinming, Qiu Yuehao, Cai Qianglin, and Xie Jiefang the most glorious task: divide "In Memory of Norman Bethune" into five parts, each person memorizing one part, not missing or misreading a single word.

Chairman Mao's teachings, every word was like the sun's rays, every word was like sweet dew, every word was the spiritual nourishment they urgently needed. Soon, the five youths had memorized it.

Later, they tore up the note and dictated it in sections to the female youths. Everyone imprinted Chairman Mao's teachings in their minds, feeling as if they were by Chairman Mao's side, with clear minds and bodies full of strength, invincible.

In the forty days of struggle, the forty-one overseas Chinese youths deeply felt the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought and deepened their boundless love for Chairman Mao. They said, "It was Chairman Mao who gave us wisdom, it was Chairman Mao who gave us the strength to persist in the struggle!"

Hearts Forever Toward Chairman Mao

In early November, the Chinese consul in Medan arrived from Jakarta, and the Guanghua, sent by the motherland, arrived near Wura Port. The youths sensed from the panic-stricken expression of the duty officer of the Medan base command that the dawn was about to break in the dark prison.

"If we are released victorious, what should we give to our most beloved leader Chairman Mao?" The youths enthusiastically discussed this extremely moving question. After repeated discussions, everyone unanimously decided to write a letter of respect to Chairman Mao, and also make two gifts: the male youths were responsible for making a five-pointed star with Chairman Mao's portrait in the center, surrounded by forty-one small red stars; the female youths embroidered a red flag with "Long live Chairman Mao" in the center and "Forty-one Indonesian Overseas Chinese Youths" below.

As soon as the solemn decision was made, everyone rushed to complete the task. The male youths Wang Jinming, Cai Qianglin, Qiu Yuehao, Wang Qilv, Li Mingguang, Chen Zhifeng, Liu Ruizhi, Huang Fuliang, Liu Yizhi, Xiong Yicheng, Zhang Liangming, Su Ping'an, Xiong Jinglin, Wen Shichang, Huang Shuncai, Xie Wentian, Li Jinxin, Zheng Tian Shu, Xiao Yuanhui, and others took on the task of covering, while Liao Shengchang, Wu Guoming, Su Liqu, Huang Jieren, Shen Hanqing, Zhong Zhiming, He Derong, Xie Jiefang, and Yu Yazhou were responsible for making the five-pointed star. They found the hard paper boxes and colored paper sent by the refugees to pack items and candy, cutting them into concave and convex shapes that could be fitted together to form a five-pointed star. They carefully found a round relief portrait of Chairman Mao from the Chinese books and magazines stolen by the enemy, and pasted it in the center of the five-pointed star. They concentrated the boundless love of forty-one comrades for Chairman Mao, using a razor blade to carve out forty-one small red stars, one by one, and pasted them around Chairman Mao's portrait. With their hearts pounding, they completed the gift after two nights of happy labor on the night of November 15.

The red flag embroidered by the female youths Zheng Xiancai, Wang Guifeng, Huang Ailian, Liu Cuijuan, Zhong Xinxiu, Tan Weixiao, Yang Yuying, Li Chunyuan, Guo Yueying, Liao Caimei, and Zheng Xianmei was an even finer task and could only be done at night. After being imprisoned, the female youths took turns guarding at night. So, the female youth on night duty, while vigilantly watching the movements of the patrolling soldiers, embroidered one stitch at a time throughout the night.

On the first night, they embroidered the three characters "Chairman Mao," the most resounding and glorious name in the world. The next morning, everyone found that the character "seat" was not embroidered ideally, so on the second night, they embroidered it again. During the days of embroidering the flag, the eleven female youths, as soon as they got up every day, would gather around the red flag, touching and examining it, even if a single stitch was crooked. If a thread was raised, they would carefully rework it.

Three days later, on the morning of November 17, the red flag with the five shining golden characters "Long live Chairman Mao" was completed! This was the red flag that condensed the boundless affection of forty-one overseas heroes, the red flag that guided them to victory!

On the day after the red flag was completed—November 18—after repeated negotiations by the Chinese government and the resolute struggle of the forty-one youths, and because the struggle of the forty-one youths gained the support of the Indonesian people and the vast number of overseas Chinese, the political frame-up plot of the Indonesian reactionaries completely failed. The Medan base command was forced to unconditionally release the forty-one overseas Chinese youths.

On that day, at the gate of the Medan Overseas Chinese School "refugee camp," a joyous scene of victory reunion appeared. The forty-one heroic youths, along with the compatriots who had fought alongside them, embraced each other. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and "We have won!" and the song "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helm" echoed through the sky of Medan. The once formidable right-wing soldiers, seeing such a scene, could only stand to the side, dejected.

On the night of November 19, the forty-one youths, on the eve of their return to the motherland from Medan, gathered with more than a thousand male and female refugees of all ages in the square of the Medan Overseas Chinese School. They enthusiastically celebrated the victory of the forty-one youths' release from prison and sent them off on their triumphant return to the motherland. During the meeting, a heavy rain fell, but the forty-one youths stood firmly in the rain, telling the compatriots, "We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, a great socialist motherland as our support, and seven hundred million compatriots as our backing. The final victory will surely be ours!"

Now, facing the larger-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese frenzy launched by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese are taking the forty-one young heroes as an example, fighting bravely to defend the dignity of the motherland and uphold national dignity!

The forty-one overseas Chinese youths boarded the Guanghua, the ship sent by the motherland to repatriate them, with the attitude of victors. Their hearts surged with emotion, and tears welled up in their eyes as they thanked the great leader Mao Zedong and the people of the motherland for their warm care. They shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

During the return voyage, the Chinese repatriation team held a solemn ceremony on the Guanghua to distribute "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the refugees. The forty-one overseas Chinese youths, holding the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," solemnly swore before Chairman Mao's portrait: We will resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call: Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

    四十一颗红心向太阳
    ——伟大的毛泽东思想鼓舞华侨青少年同印尼反动派英勇斗争的光辉事迹
    在乌云密布的千岛之国，在苏门答腊岛北部棉兰基地司令部的黑牢里，洋溢着革命豪情的壮烈歌声，经常从罩着铁丝网的窗口冲了出来：
      “我们是中华民族海外的儿女，毛泽东时代的青少年。我们和印尼人民战斗在一起，如今在狱中坚持着不屈的斗争。毛主席啊！您是我们心中的红太阳，为了遵循您的教导，我们庄严宣誓：我们将以美丽的青春，用自己的鲜血，誓死维护祖国的荣誉！誓死保卫祖国的尊严！”
    这是四十一名华侨青少年在阴森恐怖的异国牢狱中唱出的战歌。这个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的战斗集体，这些平均年龄只有十九岁的华侨男女青少年，在狱中同残暴的印尼法西斯军人进行了四十天的英勇战斗。他们依靠毛泽东思想这个最强大的思想武器，战胜了敌人的严刑拷打和秘密审讯，粉碎了印尼反动派的政治迫害阴谋，用鲜血捍卫了祖国的尊严，坚持了民族气节。现在，他们高唱着毛泽东思想的凯歌胜利回国了。
      高唱战歌迎接斗争
    一九六六年十月十日，在印尼反动派掀起更大规模反华排华狂潮的时候，棉兰市内又响起了镇压爱国华侨的枪声。
    当天下午两点多钟，棉兰陆军当局为了破坏中国政府接运自愿回国受害华侨的工作，扑灭受害华侨反迫害斗争的烈火，同时也为了替美国主子攫取他们没有捞到的欺骗性宣传材料，他们在五次前来偷拍难侨照片的美国佬都被赶得抱头鼠窜之后，竟然又把一群印尼反动军官和便衣特务派到棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”，以所谓“检查卫生”为名，强行给难侨们拍摄侮辱性的照片来了。
    毛泽东时代的中华民族的海外儿女，岂能容得帝国主义及其走狗任意摆布！难侨们手挽手，肩并肩，把以“检查卫生”为名的两个印尼上尉军官——拿督·阿赫达·贝、兰利·玛尔甘和两个印尼便衣特务团团围住，向他们发出了震天动地的怒吼声：
      “不准拍照！”
      “留下底片！”
      “美帝国主义走狗滚出去！”
    吓得浑身哆嗦的拿督上尉拔出手枪，哑着嗓子狂喊：“如果不散开，我要开枪了！”
      “砰！砰！……”看守难侨“收容所”的反动军人鸣枪镇压了！
    但是，枪声吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的爱国侨胞！“打倒印尼反动派”的怒吼声，《团结就是力量》的歌声，压住了枪声。难侨们冒着从头上呼啸而过的子弹，把包围圈缩得更紧了。满头大汗的印尼反动军官和印尼特务，靠着反动军人用枪托替他们开道，狼狈外逃。
      一个小时以后，两辆汽车向难侨“收容所”急驰而来。头戴钢盔，身穿青色军服和斑纹军服的武装军警，狂喊乱叫，冲进“收容所”，把八个男青年强行押走。在宿舍附近，跟随军人而来的一群暴徒，围着毒打另一个华侨青年，然后又交给军人加以逮捕。这伙法西斯匪徒把九名华侨青年押着离开“收容所”的时候，还疯狂地叫嚣要把参加制止拍照的难侨全部抓走！
      新的袭击眼看就要来了。镇静自若的一群华侨青少年，抓紧时间洗了澡，换了衣裳，然后围坐在一起，
  齐声朗读毛主席语录：
      “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
      “为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”
    楼下忽然响起汽车的马达噪声和杂乱的军靴声。当一大群武装军警出现在“收容所”时，一向站在反迫害斗争前列的华侨青少年，一个个拥到他们面前，挺起腰杆喊道：“就是我们抗议你们拍照的！我们抗议你们侮辱我们的侨胞，完全是正义的行动，你们没有任何道理逮捕我们！”
    野蛮的法西斯军人，抡起枪托，挥着拳头，嚎叫着挤进人群，把三十二个青少年拉了出来，押向囚车。
    就连一个十五岁和一个十三岁的华侨少年，敌人都不放过，也被他们押走了。两个少年想到哥哥姐姐们平时给他们讲的许多革命故事，紧拉着哥姐们的手，严肃地说：“我们什么也不怕！”
    当四十一名青少年分两批被押往棉兰基地司令部的时候，他们在囚车上一会儿齐声朗诵着毛主席的语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”一会儿高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和《我们走在大路上》等歌曲。棉兰市一家反动报纸也不得不承认，这些华侨青少年是“以凯旋者的姿态，不断唱着进行曲，反复高喊着毛泽东”，被载到棉兰基地司令部的。
    是的，我们英雄的华侨青少年这时觉得自己不是去坐牢，而是高举着毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，奔赴国际阶级斗争的战场。
        脸不变色心不跳
    棉兰基地司令部一片杀气腾腾。院子里的草地四周，架起机关枪，站着一群杀人不眨眼的刽子手。
    英雄的青少年们早把生死置之度外，这时只觉得毛主席的教导一字一句地在他们耳边回响。他们面对着凶残的法西斯军人，一个个昂首挺胸，放声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    残杀了无数印尼人民的印尼反动派，妄图用法西斯暴力使华侨青少年们屈服。一群武装军人像发疯的野兽，扑到青少年面前。他们轮番用钢盔敲击青少年的头顶，用枪托猛击青少年的膝盖骨，用子弹带抽打青少年的脸颊，用皮靴踢青少年的腹部和腰部。十八岁的男青年李锦新，被打得血流满面，昏倒在地，敌人又用皮靴狠踏他的腰部。二十岁的余亚周，太阳穴被皮带抽得皮开肉绽，鲜血直冒。十九岁的女青年郑仙彩，被拳头击得脸部青肿。二十一岁的郭利华，因小腹被踢而痛倒在地。吴招安、黄顺才、丘月豪、谢文临、张良明等，有的被打得双腿不能站立，有的后脑出血，有的遍体鳞伤。
      “快说！是谁行刺拿督上尉？”右派军人狂叫着，提出如此荒唐的问题，对四十一个青少年挨个地严刑拷问。
      威武不屈的四十一位华侨青少年，人人咬紧牙，握紧拳，发出抗议的吼声：“无耻！”“你们撒谎！”“你们毒打我们是非法的，我们强烈抗议！”
      敌人看到毒打无效，一个名叫沙明·达利干的头目拔出手枪，把枪口对准余亚周嚎叫：“难道你们不怕死吗？！”反动军人们都刷地一下端起枪，把子弹推上了膛。
      年轻的余亚周，这个早年丧失父母的贫苦孩子，靠做工来读书的中学生，过去经常从祖国电台的广播里把毛主席语录速记下来，再复写给同学们学习。他在被捕前的一天日记中写道：“毛主席说，反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。……欺软怕硬，是一切反动派的本性。只要我们直起腰板，挺起胸膛，板起脸孔，‘横眉冷对千夫指’，跟他针锋相对，勇于跟他斗争，加以坚持，欺软怕硬的反动派是完全可以打倒的。”
      此刻，余亚周面对着敌人的枪口，猛地撕开衬衣，昂首挺胸，大声喝道“你们有胆量，就开枪吧！”青少年们都手挽手，肩靠肩，挺着胸膛，高声怒斥敌人：“你们这些狗东西！来吧，向这里射击！”
    纸老虎戳穿了！那个叫沙明·达利干的头目被我们的小将吓得连连后退，腰间子弹带上的几粒子弹都抖落到了地上。其他的右派军人，也一个个把枪放了下来。
    但是，敌人并没有就此罢休。当夜幕笼罩阴森的牢房时，严刑拷打还在继续。
    在一间狭小的囚室里，敌人轮番地毒打着丘月豪和郑仙彩。右派军人用警棍猛击二十岁的丘月豪，郑仙彩立即扑了过去，用自己的身体护住丘月豪；敌人抬腿猛踢郑仙彩的腹部，丘月豪又扑过去用身体掩护郑仙彩，他们就这样互相为战友分担苦痛。
    午夜，一个名叫山姆斯尔的右派军人，冲进单独关押着余亚周的囚室，穷凶极恶地提起枪托，朝着白天已受重伤的余亚周的头部猛击。余亚周的头顶又被打开一个二寸多长的窟窿，鲜血直喷。这时候，余亚周仍然威武不屈，咬牙切齿地挺立着怒骂敌人。
    夜深了，余亚周被伤痛折磨得久久不能入睡，这时他仿佛听到了战友们的亲切声音：“亚周！你想到毛主席，想到祖国，你就会浑身充满力量！”他忍住剧痛，用右手蘸着自己头上的血，在牢房的墙壁上写下了五个鲜红的大字：
      “毛主席万岁！”
        团结战斗的堡垒
    四十一名青少年被捕入狱的第二天——十月十一日清早，一群武装军人把他们当中的十一个女青年从牢房赶出来。一个满脸横肉的印尼便衣特务站在草地上，端起照相机又想拍照。
    女青年们立即识破了敌人的阴谋。郑仙彩愤怒地呼喊：“同学们，赶走美国走狗！不让他们拍照！”女青年们一个个蒙起脸，转过身子，坚决拒绝敌人拍照。
    一个右派军官冲上来，朝郑仙彩的脸上猛击了两掌。十个女青年把郑仙彩护在中间，任凭敌人用皮带抽，用枪托捣，用皮靴踢，都不能把她们分开。
      “不准打女人！不准打女人！抗议法西斯暴行！”被紧锁在附近牢房里的男青少年，也挤到窗口发出愤怒的呼喊。
    敌人慌忙把十一个女青年押回女牢房，然后直奔男牢房。再一次轮番地疯狂毒打男青少年们。但是，不管敌人怎样毒打，怒骂“美帝国主义走狗”的吼声，依然震撼着整个棉兰基地司令部。
    敌人的又一次挑衅被粉碎了！女青年们在当天的狱中日记上写道：“这场风波过去，更大的风波也许跟随而来。来吧！反动的东西，你越来得多越好，我们一个个地把你们吞掉！”
    入狱的第三天——十月十二日，四十一名青少年一齐向疯狂迫害他们的印尼反动派反击了。这天清早，女牢房里就响起了战斗的歌声。她们用《我们走在大路上》的曲调，唱着自己创作的一首团结战斗的歌：
      “我们不是犯人，为了坚持民族气节，被无理关在牢房。严刑拷打，吓不倒我们。向前进！向前进！为了争取人类解放，向前进！向前进！朝着胜利的方向！
      “毛主席的好教导：下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。胜利一定属于我们。向前进！向前进！为了争取人类解放，向前进！向前进！朝着胜利的方向！”
      女青年们刚练熟了新编的歌曲，正好难侨代表进基地司令部交涉来了。十一个女青年欢呼着冲出牢房，高唱起《大海航行靠舵手》和她们自己新编的战歌，并且朝着正同印尼当局交涉的难侨代表高呼：
      “坚持民族气节！”
      “祖国尊严不可侮！”
      “真理在我们手里！”
      “我们有伟大的祖国做靠山！”
      “我们有七亿祖国人民做后盾！”
      “胜利一定属于我们！”
      被锁在牢房里的男青少年们，也挤到铁丝窗口唱呀！喊呀！男女青少年们的口号声和歌声互相呼应，形成了对印尼反动派的强大示威。难侨代表看到青少年们在狱中斗志昂扬，朝着他们竖起大拇指，连连点头称赞。
      基地司令部的反动头目被这个场面吓得丧魂落魄，棉兰基地司令朗古达亲自出马，遣兵调将。五十多个全副武装的军警开来了，他们把十一个女青年围住，拚命要把郑仙彩拖出来。女青年们手挽手，把郑仙彩护在中间。这时，拳头、皮带不断地打在女青年们的头上、身上。
    “住手！我出来！看你们把我怎么办？”郑仙彩看到战友们为保护自己遭到敌人毒打，大踏步走出护卫圈来。
    敌人把郑仙彩关进了一个单独的小牢房。郑仙彩，这个坚强的华侨女青年，她曾在难侨“收容所”参加举办识字班，经常给难侨的孩子讲革命故事，教革命歌曲，是一个见义勇为，热爱集体的好青年。现在，她面对着一群法西斯匪徒，胸中升起了强烈的怒火。她握紧拳头，咬牙切齿地连声骂道：“不知耻的狗东西！美帝国主义走狗！快给我滚开！统统滚开！”其他的女青年同时在另一间房里高喊：“美帝国主义走狗！滚开！滚开！”
    女青年们终于把一群野兽赶走。接着，她们把关押郑仙彩的牢房扭开，救出了战友。
        六天绝食斗争
    四十一个华侨青少年在被捕的当天，就决心按照毛主席的教导，准备同残暴的印尼反动派进行殊死的斗争。他们入狱的第二天上午，通过巧妙的方式互相取得了联系，一致宣布绝食开始。他们严正地向军事当局提出：立即停止严刑拷打，立即把受伤的战友送医院治疗，必须宣布全部无罪释放。
    一天又一天过去了，肉体遭受严重摧残的青少年，体力在迅速减退。可是，这个用毛泽东思想武装起来的战斗集体，斗志越来越旺，战斗力越来越强。在男女牢房里，青少年们凭着记忆，一遍又一遍地朗诵着毛主席语录：
      “我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”
      “我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”
    在闷热的男牢房里，在昏暗的灯光下，二十岁的蔡强霖摇着扇子，给身边的战友扇凉、赶蚊虫，直扇得战友们睡熟了，他才入睡。有时，他又在深夜燃起一根蜡烛，沿着战友的身边捉臭虫，为的是让战友们睡得安稳一些。大多数战友睡在没有铺席子的水泥地上，有些人出现了水肿，他就让水肿的战友睡到仅有的一些木板上，自己睡水泥地。这个贫苦家庭出身，靠半工半读才读完初中的青年，在牢房的墙壁上写下了毛主席的战斗号召：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
      毛主席的话，把黑森森的牢房照得通明透亮，引导着这群海外的英雄儿女，从黑夜战斗到天明。
    绝食斗争进入第四天。青少年们的体力越来越弱了，大家争着照顾伤重病重的战友，互相扶持着上厕所。就在这天黎明，他们怀着无限革命豪情，集体创作了战斗的诗篇《我们的誓言》，接着又为它谱了曲。他们在斗争中千百次地唱着这首战歌，表达了他们对最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和伟大祖国的无限热爱，表达了他们对伟大的毛泽东思想的无限忠诚。他们唱道：
      “祖国啊！你是我们最强大的靠山，
    为了维护你的尊严，我们在作着英勇的绝食斗争。
    每当饥饿的痛苦在不断折磨我们时，
      想起了你，
      一切苦难都不复存在。
      毛主席啊！您是我们心中的红太阳，
      为了遵循您的教导，我们正与敌人进行面对面的斗争。
      每当我们的躯体横遭毒打时，
      想起了您，
      我们肉体上的痛苦就消灭净尽！”
      在绝食斗争最困难的时候，青年们越来越焦急地关注着这个战斗集体中两个小战友——十三岁的廖盛昌和十五岁的郑天书。这两个在难侨“收容所”里勇敢地驱逐过美国佬和蒋帮特务的华侨少年，虽然被饥饿折磨得越来越瘦削，但是他们始终和哥哥姐姐们战斗在一起，任何时候也没有动摇过。
    印尼反动派被青少年们的绝食斗争吓得团团转。他们不断派军官和特务来到牢房，对青少年们进行种种威逼利诱，妄图破坏绝食斗争。但是，他们每次得到的回答都是一片怒逐声：“无耻的走狗！滚开！滚开！”
    在我们青少年英雄大无畏的斗争面前，印尼反动派又败下阵来。十月十六日，也就是青少年们绝食六天之后，棉兰军事当局被迫答应给伤病青少年治疗，停止严刑拷打。绝食斗争取得了决定性胜利，青少年们在十月十七日复食，准备迎接新的斗争。
        舌战法西斯匪徒
    我国政府强烈抗议印尼反动派扣押四十一名华侨青少年的正义声音，使敌人胆战心惊。第二次接运难侨的光华轮就要到达勿拉港，使棉兰陆军当局的反动头目坐立不安。黔驴技穷的基地司令部的头目，日夜开会，寻找脱身之计。
    个别审讯开始了。敌人妄想用这套法西斯的神经战术，从打不烂的钢铁堡垒上冲开缺口，迫使青少年们就范。
    英雄的华侨青少年，从毛主席著作中找到了斗争的法宝：在战略上要藐视一切敌人，在战术上要重视一切敌人。他们为了随时粉碎敌人的阴谋诡计，早就做好了对付秘密审讯的准备。
    一天，余亚周被押进了审讯室。一个军官坐在那里，装出一副神气活现的样子，见到余亚周就把桌子一拍：“你是领导人！如果不说出你们内部的情况，就判你无期徒刑！”
      “你们根本没有权利审判我们！你们妄想判我们的刑，印尼人民决不会答应！你说我是领导人，证据在那里！”余亚周早已料到敌人这一着，马上正言厉色地迎头给敌人一棒。
    那军官像泄了气的皮球，脸上的肉颤了一下，忽然又嘻皮笑脸地要余亚周喝茶，抽烟。接着，那军官翻身跑到另一间房子，同他的上级咕噜了一阵又出来了。
      “你是自愿到这里来的？还是被逮捕来的？”
    余亚周以为敌人取来了什么新法宝，现在听到敌人提出了这样一个拙劣的问题，几乎要笑出声来，于是乘势向敌人展开了进攻：“我是被你们非法逮捕来的！而且遭到了你们的严刑拷打！”
      “你们为什么要绝食！究竟是谁在领导？”
    敌人露底了。余亚周进逼敌人：“我们完全无罪，我们绝食是抗议你们的非法逮捕和严刑拷打，不需要任何人领导！”
    在正义的谴责面前，敌人哑口无言。
    敌人又搬出了惯用的法西斯诈骗术。一个军官在审讯二十岁的丘月豪时，故作镇静地说：“你的朋友已向我们说了，你就是领导人！”
    我们英雄的青少年是一个坚不可摧的团结的战斗集体！丘月豪充满无限自信，看到敌人玩弄这种拙劣的政治讹诈，故意将了敌人一军：“如果有人这么说，那就叫他出来作证吧！”那个右派军官被回击得半天说不出话来。勇敢机警的丘月豪，随即以原告的姿态，据理申斥敌人：“你们向我们的同胞挑衅，不经我们的允许就拍照，是对我们祖国和难侨的侮辱，是一个政治阴谋，我们不能容忍你们这样做！”
    敌人在我们的英雄小将面前下不了台，马上来了一个急转弯：“你还有什么要求吗？”
    “立即释放我们！赔偿一切损失！”丘月豪最后又给了敌人一个沉重的打击。
      敌人接着又审讯了四个青年。他们记录了一大堆“口供”，但什么也没有捞到。在审讯郑仙彩的时候，一个军官无可奈何，十分懊丧地说：“你们这些人真厉害！中国大陆上有红卫兵，印尼也许有红卫兵，棉兰大概也有红卫兵，你们都是红卫兵吧？”
      郑仙彩自豪地对敌人说：“你们这样害怕红卫兵，可见我们的红卫兵做对了！如果我将来也能成为一个红卫兵，那我就太高兴了！”
    敌人的非法审讯，就这样一次又一次地失败了。
    胜利的源泉
    是什么力量支持着手无寸铁的海外儿女敢于这样同凶残的法西斯敌人进行不屈不挠的斗争？是什么力量鼓舞着他们不惜牺牲自己的一切去争取胜利？我们的四十一名小英雄，用他们可歌可泣的斗争事迹作出了响当当的回答：这就是伟大的毛泽东思想，这就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    一九六六年十一月十六日，也就是我们的小英雄们即将胜利出狱的前两天，他们曾经怀着海一样深的感情，在狱中给我们的伟大领袖毛主席写了一封信。人们从这封信中可以看到，我们的小英雄虽然身在海外，但是因为毛泽东思想的光辉照耀着他们，抚育着他们，他们就能够像一棵棵劲松挺立在暴风骤雨之中。
    他们在给毛主席的信中写道：
      “从我们被捕的那个时刻起，我们就用毛主席的教导来互相勉励，互相鼓舞。从斗争中，我们深刻体会到毛泽东思想的无比威力。在敌人来回巡防的黑暗的囚室里，同志们凭着记忆，把毛主席语录一遍又一遍地朗读。虽然我们身在阴森恐怖的牢房里，可是毛泽东思想的光辉却照亮了我们的心。”
      “我们向毛主席保证：我们一定要继续以毛泽东思想为武器，在这场国际阶级斗争中取得最后胜利！”
      我们的青少年是怎样无比地忠诚于毛泽东思想，他们又是怎样从毛泽东思想中汲取了无限的鼓舞力量，这还可以从下面的故事中得到最好的说明。
    这是青少年们取得绝食斗争胜利以后的一天中午，狱外的难侨们，给狱中战友送来了一张折叠着的纸条。
      “是书信？还是什么？”青少年们把纸条缓缓展开，颗颗红心在剧烈地跳动，大家不由得轻声欢呼起来：
      “是毛主席的文章！”
      “是我们最需要的精神武器！”
    纸条上，工工整整地抄写着毛主席的光辉著作
  《为人民服务》全文，这是狱外侨胞送给狱中难友的最珍贵的礼物。
    在异国牢狱中，在一个回合接着一个回合的斗争中，青少年们凭着记忆，你一句，我一句，一遍又一遍地集体背诵毛主席语录，指导自己的斗争。现在，他们得到了放射着万丈光芒的《为人民服务》全文，怎能不感到无比兴奋呢！
    为了防避敌人的搜查，更重要的是为了把毛主席的指示深印在脑海内，战友们给了余亚周、王金铭、丘月豪、蔡强霖和谢接芳一个最光荣的任务：把《为人民服务》分成五段，每人背熟一段，一个字都不能错读或遗漏。
    毛主席的教导，每一个字都像太阳的光辉，每一个字都像甘霖雨露，每一个字都是他们急需的精神食粮。一会儿，五个男青年就背熟了。
    随后，他们把纸条撕毁，又分段口授给女青年们。大家把毛主席的教导印在脑子里，觉得自己就像在毛主席身边一样，心明眼亮，浑身是劲，所向无敌。
    在四十天的斗争中，四十一名华侨青少年深深体会到了毛泽东思想的无穷威力，也更加深了他们无限热爱毛主席的强烈感情。他们说：“是毛主席给了我们智慧，是毛主席给了我们坚持斗争的力量！”
    红心永远向着毛主席
    十一月上旬，中国驻棉兰领事从雅加达来到了棉兰，祖国派来的光华轮开到了棉兰附近的勿拉港。青少年们从棉兰基地司令部值班军官惊慌失措的窘态中，敏锐地预见到黎明的曙光即将在黑牢内升起。
      “如果我们胜利出狱了，我们应该用什么来献给最最敬爱的领袖毛主席呢？”青少年们热烈地讨论了这个无比激动人心的问题。经过反复商量，大家一致决定给毛主席写一封致敬信，另外再做两件礼物：男青年负责做一个五角星，中间贴着毛主席像，周围簇拥着四十一颗小红星；女青年绣制一面红旗，中间绣出“毛主席万岁”五个大字，下边绣出“四十一名印尼华侨青少年”十一个小字。
    庄严的决定一经作出，大家便争分夺秒，呕心沥血地去完成。男青少年王金铭、蔡强霖、丘月豪、王其禄、李明光、陈志文、刘瑞芝、黄富良、刘义志、邢益成、张良明、苏平安、熊敬粦、温世昌、黄顺才、谢文临、李锦新、郑天书、萧远辉等担任掩护，由廖盛昌、吴国明、苏立球、黄界仁、沈汉清、钟志明、何德荣、谢接芳、余亚周等负责制作五角星。他们找出难侨送来的装物品的硬纸盒和包糖果的彩色纸，裁剪成一凹一凸可以套起来的五角星。他们巧妙地从被敌人抢劫去的中国书刊中，找到了一张毛主席的圆形浮雕像，小心翼翼地贴在五角星中间。他们把四十一个战友无限热爱毛主席的感情凝结在一起，用刮脸刀一刀刀地刻出了四十一颗小红星，一颗颗地贴到毛主席像的周围。他们怀着跳动的红心，经过两个夜晚的幸福劳动，在十一月十五日深夜把礼物制成了。
    由女青年郑仙彩、王桂花、黄爱莲、刘翠娟、钟新秀、潭微笑、杨玉英、李春园、郭月玲、廖彩玲、郑仙妹负责制作的红旗，更是一件细活，并且只能利用晚上的时间做。入狱后，女青年们每晚都轮流值班守夜。于是，值夜班的女青年，一面警惕地注视着巡逻军人的动静，一面一针一线地刺绣彻夜。
    第一个晚上先绣了“毛主席”三个字，这是全世界最响亮、最辉煌的名字。第二天清早，大家发现“席”字还绣得不够理想，于是，第二个晚上又重绣。绣旗的那几天，十一个女青年每天起床后第一件事，就是大家围着红旗抚摸、端详，那怕是有一针绣歪了。有一根线鼓起来了，都要认真返工。
    三天后的十一月十七日凌晨，“毛主席万岁”五个金字闪闪发光的红旗绣成了！这是凝结着四十一名海外英雄儿女无限深情的红旗，是引导着他们走向胜利的红旗！
    就在红旗绣成后的第二天——十一月十八日，经过我国政府的反复交涉和四十一名青少年的坚决斗争，也由于四十一名青少年的斗争得到了印尼人民和广大华侨的支持，印尼反动派策划的政治陷害阴谋彻底破产，棉兰基地司令部被迫无条件释放四十一名华侨青少年出狱。
    这一天，在棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”门口，出现了欢腾的胜利会师场面。四十一名英雄的青少年，还有和他们并肩斗争的受害侨胞们，在这里拥抱了又拥抱。“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“我们胜利了！”的口号声，《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声，响彻了棉兰市上空。曾经凶煞一时的右派军人，看到这样的场面，只有垂头丧气地站到一边。
    十一月十九日夜晚，四十一名青少年离开棉兰回国的前夕，在棉兰华侨中学广场上，一千多名男女老少难侨聚集一起，热烈庆祝四十一名青少年胜利出狱，欢送他们凯旋回国。大会进行过程中，大雨滂沱，四十一名青少年在大雨中屹立不动，他们对受害侨胞们说：“我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想作指南，有伟大的社会主义祖国作靠山，有七亿祖国亲人作后盾，最后胜利一定是我们的！”
    现在，面对着印尼右派反动势力掀起的更大规模的反华排华狂潮，广大的爱国侨胞正以四十一名小英雄为榜样，为了维护祖国尊严和坚持民族气节而英勇斗争！
                                    新华社记者（附图片）
    四十一名华侨青少年以胜利者的姿态登上祖国派来的接侨船——光华轮。他们心潮滚滚，热泪盈眶，感谢伟大领袖毛主席和祖国人民对他们的亲切关怀。他们高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
          新华社稿
