The U.S. bandits' barbaric bombing of Hanoi fully exposes their heinous crimes, thoroughly revealing the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy with the Soviet revisionist leadership to push for "war to force peace." The Soviet revisionists are actively promoting the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" deception with great effort.

New China News Agency, December 15th: Our reporter reports: The Johnson administration's successive dispatch of bandit planes to bomb the city of Hanoi is a heinous crime that fully exposes the U.S. imperialists' collusion with the Soviet modern revisionist leadership to plot the "war to force peace" conspiracy.

The U.S. imperialists' recent "escalation" of the war is part of their long-planned scheme to expand the invasion of Vietnam, in close coordination with the Soviet revisionist leadership. It is also a manifestation of the U.S. imperialists' desperate and reckless behavior in the face of severe defeats, especially in the recent so-called "dry season offensive."

Since late October, when U.S. imperialist leader Johnson convened the Manila meeting with the South Vietnamese traitorous clique and Vietnamese invasion lackeys to formulate plans to intensify the Vietnam War, the U.S. imperialists have taken a series of steps to escalate the war, pushing forward their "war to force peace" conspiracy. In South Vietnam, the number of U.S. invading troops has increased from over 330,000 in October to over 370,000, and it is planned to increase to 400,000 by the end of the year. The U.S. has formulated plans to intensify attacks on the liberated areas in South Vietnam, including the Mekong Delta. The bombing of liberated areas by U.S. bandit planes has also significantly increased. In North Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists have intensified aerial bombing; since December, U.S. bandit planes have bombed Hanoi four times in a row. Simultaneously, they have been shelling the coastal facilities and ships of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from the sea, with the shelling areas moving further north from the military demarcation line. The U.S. has also sent its only nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the "Enterprise," to the South China Sea to threaten Vietnam and China.

During this period, the U.S. has also intensified its war provocations against China. On November 30th, U.S. military aircraft openly bombed Chinese fishing boats engaged in peaceful operations in the western waters of the Gulf of Tonkin, killing and injuring many Chinese fishermen. As pointed out by the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, the U.S. imperialists, while expanding their aggression in Vietnam, have repeatedly dispatched bandit planes to bomb and strafe Chinese fishing boats and merchant ships, despite multiple serious warnings from the Chinese government and people. This is not an isolated incident.

While escalating the war, the U.S. imperialists are also continuing to intensify military build-up and war preparations at home, issuing constant war threats. In October, the U.S. government conscripted over 60,000 soldiers, bringing the total number of U.S. troops to over 3.29 million, the highest figure in 12 years. Johnson recently revealed that he would request an additional $90 to $100 billion for the Vietnam War in the current fiscal year. U.S. Air Force Secretary Brown blatantly declared that the economic targets in North Vietnam are all "collateral" for the U.S. Air Force. The Navy spokesperson also declared that "the next step must be to increase pressure." Senator Stennis, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee, even advocated for "blockading the port of Haiphong and other ports in North Vietnam." U.S. Secretary of State Rusk, while en route to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council meeting, stopped in South Vietnam on December 8th, declaring that they would "fight to the end" and threatening to "urge" its allies to serve the Vietnam War at the NATO meeting.

As the Vietnam War "gradually escalates," the U.S. imperialists' collusion with modern revisionism has become more blatant. In the past month and a half, the U.S. imperialists, in collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership, have instructed the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant, the Vatican Pope, and some reactionaries to stage the "Christmas truce," "stop bombing," and "peace talks" farce. There have been frequent secret missions between Washington, Moscow, and the United Nations, scheming in every possible way to force the Vietnamese people to surrender.

Especially in Moscow, "peace talk" brokers have been coming and going for a month. First, Canadian Foreign Minister Martin brought the "Vietnam Peace Plan" to discuss with Soviet leaders in early November. Then, British Foreign Secretary George Brown brought "U.S. messages on the Vietnam issue" to secretly consult with Soviet leaders on "peace talk" strategies in late November. Brown revealed after the meeting that he and Gromyko discussed the issue of "achieving a possible extension of the Christmas ceasefire." To push the "peace talk" deception further, the Johnson administration recently announced a 48-hour "ceasefire" for Christmas and New Year's, and threatened to extend this "ceasefire" period. The U.S. also conducted so-called "prisoner exchanges" and other probes, attempting to open a "peace talk" gap.

However, the sound of bombs in Hanoi completely exposed the deceptive "peace talk" smokescreen spread by the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices, the Soviet revisionist leadership, thoroughly revealing the U.S. imperialists' treacherous and vicious nature and the Soviet revisionist leadership's traitorous face. It fully demonstrates that the "peace" of the U.S. imperialists is to force the Vietnamese people to kneel and surrender under U.S. war pressure.

The U.S. imperialists' war escalation will not intimidate the Vietnamese people, and their "peace talk" tricks will not deceive the Vietnamese people. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "We must have a clear mind, which includes not believing the 'good words' of imperialism and not being afraid of imperialism's threats." Under the call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh to "not fear hardship and sacrifice, and to fight resolutely to complete victory," the heroic Vietnamese people have already foiled the U.S. imperialists' numerous war "escalations" and "war to force peace" conspiracies. They will surely foil the U.S. imperialists' new conspiracies and will definitely defeat the U.S. aggressors.

    美国强盗野蛮轰炸河内的滔天罪行
    充分暴露美苏合搞“以战迫和”大阴谋
    苏修积极为美帝的“和谈”骗局大肆活动大卖力气
    新华社十五日讯　本社记者报道：美国约翰逊政府接连派出强盗飞机对河内市区进行狂轰滥炸的滔天罪行，充分暴露了美帝国主义者伙同苏联现代修正主义领导集团加紧勾结，策划“以战迫和”的大阴谋。
    美帝国主义的这次战争“升级”，是它在苏联修正主义领导集团的密切配合下蓄谋已久的扩大侵越战争计划的一部分，也是美帝国主义在侵越战争中，特别是最近在所谓“旱季攻势”中遭到严重失败的情况下进行疯狂冒险和绝望挣扎的表现。
    自从十月下旬美帝国主义头子约翰逊召集南越卖国集团和侵越仆从举行马尼拉会议，制定加剧侵越战争的计划以来，美帝国主义采取了一连串加剧侵越战争的步骤，加紧推行它“以战迫和”的阴谋。在南越战场上，侵越美军已从十月间的三十三万多人增加到三十七万多人，并且宣布到年底要增加到四十万人。美国已经制订了加紧进攻越南南方解放区，包括湄公河三角洲地带的计划。美国强盗飞机对解放区的轰炸，也大大加强了。在越南北方，美帝国主义加强了空中的轰炸，十二月份以来，美国强盗飞机已连续四次轰炸河内；同时从海上炮击越南民主共和国的海岸设施和沿海船只，炮击地区越来越从军事分界线地区向北移动。美国还把它唯一的核动力航空母舰“企业号”开到南中国海，对越南和中国进行威胁。
    在这期间，美国还加强了对中国的战争挑衅。十一月三十日，美国军用飞机公然轰炸在北部湾西部海域进行和平作业的中国渔船，炸死炸伤中国渔民多人。正如中国国防部发言人所指出的，美帝国主义在扩大侵略越南战争的同时，不顾中国政府和中国人民的多次严重警告，一次又一次派遣强盗飞机对我国渔船、商船进行轰炸扫射，绝不是一个孤立的事件。
    在加紧战争升级的同时，美帝国主义在国内也正在继续加紧扩军备战，并不断发出战争叫嚣。十月份，美国政府征兵六万多名，使美军总数达到三百二十九万余人，这是十二年来的最高数字。约翰逊在几天前透露，他将要求在本财政年度内再追加侵越军费九十至一百亿美元。美国空军部长布朗露骨地叫嚷越南北方的经济目标都是“美国空军手上的抵押品”。海军发言人也叫嚷“下一步的行动必须是增加压力”。美国参议院军备小组委员会主席斯坦尼斯甚至鼓吹要“封锁海防港和北越的其他一些港口”。美国国务卿腊斯克在出席北大西洋集团理事会会议途中，八日又到南越进行活动，叫嚷要“干到底”，并且扬言他将在北大西洋集团会议上“督促”它的盟国为侵越战争效力。
    随着侵越战争的“逐步升级”，美帝国主义同现代修正主义的勾结，更加露骨。一个半月来，美帝国主义串通苏联修正主义领导集团，指使联合国秘书长吴丹、梵蒂冈教皇和一些反动派，大搞圣诞节“休战”、“停炸”、“和谈”把戏。在华盛顿、莫斯科、联合国之间明差密使频繁往来，千方百计地策划着诱迫越南人民投降的阴谋。
    特别是在莫斯科，一个月来“和谈”掮客络绎不绝。先是加拿大外交部长马丁带着“越南和平计划”于十一月上旬和苏联领导人会谈。紧接着，英国外交大臣布朗带着“美国关于越南问题的口信”于十一月下旬和苏联领导人密商“和谈”机宜。布朗在会谈后透露，他同葛罗米柯研究了“实现可能延长的圣诞节停火”的问题。为了把“和谈”骗局推进一步，约翰逊政府最近又宣布在圣诞节、新年各实行四十八小时的所谓“停火”，并且扬言要延长这个“停火”时限。美国还进行所谓“交换战俘”等试探，妄图打开“和谈”的缺口。
    可是，河内市的炸弹声完全戳穿了美帝国主义及其帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团所散布的“和谈”烟幕，彻底暴露了美帝国主义阴险狡诈的凶恶嘴脸和苏联修正主义领导集团丑恶的叛徒面目。它充分说明了，美帝国主义的“和平”，就是要越南人民在美国的战争压力面前屈膝投降。
    美帝国主义的战争升级吓不倒越南人民，它的“和谈”花招也骗不了越南人民。正如毛主席所指出的：“我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”在胡志明主席“不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利”的号召下，英雄的越南人民已经粉碎了美帝国主义无数次战争“升级”和“以战迫和”的阴谋。他们也必将粉碎美帝国主义新的阴谋，并且必将彻底打败美国侵略者。
