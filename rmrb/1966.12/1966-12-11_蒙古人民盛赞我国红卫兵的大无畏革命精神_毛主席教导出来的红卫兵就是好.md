Mongolian people have praised the revolutionary actions of China's Red Guards, saying "very good" and "right on."

An elderly Mongolian worker said, "Under the leadership of the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has produced the Red Guards. What they do is completely revolutionary. Their fearless, daring-to-think, daring-to-do, and daring-to-act revolutionary spirit is truly admirable."

A female worker said, "The Red Guards trained by Chairman Mao are truly excellent, well-organized, and disciplined. They love the people the most and hate the class enemies. Their actions are revolutionary."

Another worker said, "The Red Guards are truly worthy disciples of Chairman Mao and worthy successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

A miner, speaking enthusiastically about China's proletarian Cultural Revolution, said, "Chairman Mao's Red Guards are very good."

A student said, "Chairman Mao is the living Lenin. I want to study Chairman Mao's works and sing 'The East Is Red' loudly."

An elderly Mongolian woman, after watching a film about Chairman Mao meeting with Red Guards and revolutionary students, said excitedly, "The Chinese Red Guards are so fortunate to be received by Chairman Mao! Although I am old, I really want to see Chairman Mao!"

Another Mongolian woman said after watching the film, "Chairman Mao is truly great! From the fact that Chairman Mao received the Red Guards in an open-top car, it can be seen how much Chairman Mao trusts the Red Guards, how much Chairman Mao trusts the masses, how much the Red Guards love Chairman Mao, how much the masses love Chairman Mao, and how sincerely the Chinese people support Chairman Mao."

Yet another Mongolian woman said, "Some people slander the Chinese Cultural Revolution, but after watching the film, I feel that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is very good."

A Mongolian medical worker happily said, "The revolutionary actions of the Chinese Red Guards are correct and well done."

Another Mongolian citizen told a Chinese comrade, "The Red Guards' spirit of daring to revolutionize and daring to struggle is very good." He also shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong! Long live the Red Guards!"
