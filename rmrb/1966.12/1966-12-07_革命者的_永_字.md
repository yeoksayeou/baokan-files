When Cai Yongxiang first enlisted, his squad leader asked him his name. He replied, "I am Cai Yongxiang." "Is it the '永' character in 'permanently prioritize politics'?" Cai Yongxiang nodded and added with emphasis and deep emotion, "My '永' character is the '永' character of always listening to Chairman Mao and always following Chairman Mao in revolution!" This brief statement expressed the heartfelt words of a proletarian revolutionary soldier.

What a revolutionary "永" character!

It is this "永" character that guides Cai Yongxiang to diligently study Chairman Mao's works, using the "Three Articles" as a guide to revolution and as a lifelong motto.

It is this "永" character that drives Cai Yongxiang in the battle to destroy the bourgeoisie and promote the proletariat, daring to charge into the fray, using the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" to fight against selfish thoughts, and establishing a communist worldview of selflessness.

It is this "永" character that inspires Cai Yongxiang to learn from heroes, walk the path of heroes, create heroic achievements, and for the defense of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, rescue a group of Red Guards, sacrificing his precious youth and establishing an immortal merit.

Every one of us proletarian revolutionary soldiers should uphold this revolutionary "永" character, like Comrade Cai Yongxiang, always having a red sun in our hearts, always being loyal to Chairman Mao, always being loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and always following Chairman Mao in revolution!

    革命者的“永”字
    解放军战士　李福康　王成都　倪勤先
    蔡永祥刚入伍时，班长问他叫什么名字，他回答说：“我叫蔡永祥。”“是不是永远突出政治的‘永’字？”蔡永祥点点头，又加重语气，无限深情地说：“我这个‘永’字是永远听毛主席的话，永远跟毛主席干革命的‘永’字！”这句简短的话，道出了一个无产阶级革命战士的心声。
    好一个革命者的“永”字！
    就是这个“永”字，指导着蔡永祥刻苦地学习毛主席著作，把“老三篇”作为革命的入门向导，又作为终生的座右铭。
    就是这个“永”字，鞭策着蔡永祥在灭资兴无的战斗中，敢于冲锋陷阵，用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，向私心杂念开火，树立一心为公的共产主义世界观。
    就是这个“永”字，激励着蔡永祥学英雄的精神，走英雄的道路，创英雄的业绩，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命，抢救一列车的红卫兵小将，献出了宝贵的青春，立下了不朽的功勋。
    我们每一个无产阶级革命战士，都应该树立这个革命的“永”字，像蔡永祥同志那样，心里永远有颗红太阳，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远跟着毛主席干革命！
