Japanese youth from various sectors preparing to participate in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering spoke to a reporter from the Dongfang News Agency on December 20th. They condemned the Sato government and some anti-China elements for their schemes to obstruct and sabotage the gathering. They also expressed their determination to overcome all difficulties and strive to the end to realize the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering.

The leader of the delegation from the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) Sakata said: "U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionists fear the thought of Mao Zedong and the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. They are desperately trying to sabotage the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering. However, the increasingly united Japanese youth will overcome all obstacles and stride forward to realize the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering."

The leader of the delegation from the All-Japan Port Workers' Joint Struggle Conference, Yamamoto Shinpou, said: "We protest against the Japanese government's policy of hostility towards China and will organize the broad masses of workers more powerfully to wage an unyielding struggle against this policy."

The leader of the delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Enterprise Youth Liaison Association, Morioka, emphasized: "No force can destroy Sino-Japanese friendship. Just as the achievements of the Chinese economic and trade exhibitions held in Kitakyushu and Nagoya have shown, the broad masses of the Japanese people, like the Chinese people, have boundless respect for Chairman Mao. As long as we take the thought of Mao Zedong as our guide and fight against the enemy, we will certainly be able to overcome the difficulties we face."

The secretary-general of the Tokyo Youth Delegation, Masano Kaneo, said: "In the future, we will further strengthen our struggle, persist in our struggle, and strive to realize the Sino-Japanese Youth Grand Gathering. The Red Guards of China, in the fierce struggle of the proletarian cultural revolution, long for the visit of Japanese youth to China. I express my sincere respect to them."

The leader of the delegation from the Japanese Journalists' Alliance, Matsuoka Shinobu, said: "Japanese youth, after several months of sharp struggle against the Japanese reactionaries and modern revisionists and their followers, have raised their consciousness and strengthened their unity. In this struggle, we do not relax our study of the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' for a moment. We draw great encouragement, courage, and confidence from Chairman Mao's words."

On December 22nd, the leader of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Youth Delegation, Ogura Sohei, also spoke to a reporter from the Dongfang News Agency, pointing out that the call to realize the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering is becoming increasingly widespread and fervent. However, under the encouragement of revisionism, the Sato government, which has always followed the United States and been hostile to China, has taken obstructive and suppressive actions. This only further exposes the Sato government's ugly, anti-China, and anti-people nature. We must strengthen our unity, persist in our struggle, and strive to achieve victory in realizing the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering.

    日本青年力争实现日中青年友好大联欢
    决心以毛泽东思想为指针战胜困难
    谴责美日反动派和现代修正主义者的破坏阴谋
    据新华社二十三日讯东京消息：准备参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢的日本各界青年二十日对东方通讯社记者发表谈话，谴责佐藤政府和一些反华分子阻挠和破坏日中青年友好大联欢的阴谋，同时表示决心排除万难，坚决为实现日中青年友好大联欢而奋斗到底。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部代表团团长坂田说：“美帝国主义、日本反动派和现代修正主义者害怕毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命，正在拚命地破坏日中青年友好大联欢。”但是越来越加强团结的日本青年，将会克服一切障碍，为实现日中青年友好大联欢而阔步前进。
    全日本港湾共同斗争会议代表团团长山本信晃说：我们抗议日本政府推行敌视中国的政策，并且要更有力地组织广大工人，为反对这个政策而进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    日中友好企业青年联络会代表团团长森冈强调说：“日中友好是任何力量也破坏不了的。”“就像在北九州和名古屋举办的中国经济贸易展览会取得的成就所显示的那样，广大的日本人民和中国人民一样对毛主席是无限敬爱的。只要我们以毛泽东思想为指针，同敌人进行斗争，就一定能够战胜我们面临的困难。”
    东京青年代表团秘书长增野珂奈江说：“我们今后要更进一步加强斗争，坚持斗争，直到实现日中青年大联欢。中国红卫兵在无产阶级文化大革命的激烈斗争中切望日本青年访问中国，我向他们致以热情的敬意。”
    日本记者同盟代表团长松冈信夫说：“日本青年经过几个月的对日本反动派和现代修正主义及其追随者的尖锐斗争，提高了思想，加强了团结。我们在这个斗争中一刻也不放松学习《毛主席语录》。我们从毛主席的话中得到巨大的鼓舞、勇气和信心。”
    山口县青年代表团团长小仓壮平二十二日也向东方通讯社记者发表谈话指出，要求实现第二届日中青年友好大联欢的呼声越来越广泛，越来越高涨；但是在修正主义的鼓励下，一贯追随美国、敌视中国的佐藤政府，采取了阻挠和压制的行动。这只能更加暴露佐藤政府反华、反人民的丑恶本质。我们一定要加强团结，坚持斗争，争取胜利实现第二届日中青年友好大联欢。
