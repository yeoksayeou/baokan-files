In the battlefields of South Vietnam, people hold boundless affection and love for our great leader Chairman Mao.

A commander of a battalion in the South Vietnamese Liberation Army took a portrait of Chairman Mao with him when he left his hometown. He has gone through hundreds of battles, always keeping the portrait of Chairman Mao with him. When a Chinese journalist visited him, he solemnly took out the portrait of Chairman Mao from his diary and said excitedly, "For more than five years, in the storms of revolutionary struggle, on the front lines of the anti-American fight, I have been with Chairman Mao day and night! In the future, I will forever be with Chairman Mao, and let Chairman Mao see a unified Vietnam and a complete revolutionary victory!"

A seamstress from South Vietnam gave birth to her first child. What meaningful name should she give to this new life? After much thought, she decided to name the child "Viet Hua." She also asked a Chinese comrade to take the first photo of little "Viet Hua" and bring it to Beijing. She said, "I want my child to love China and Chairman Mao from a young age; to know that in China, in the East, in the hearts of revolutionary people around the world, a bright red sun has risen."

Once, in the dense forests of the Truong Son Mountains, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army held a bonfire evening with Chinese comrades. The soldiers clapped their hands and sang songs, celebrating their victory in battle. When the Chinese comrades mentioned that Chairman Mao was in good health and had recently attended a rally at Tiananmen Square in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression, the entire venue immediately erupted with shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" A female soldier, speaking on behalf of everyone, said, "Thank you, Chairman Mao. May Chairman Mao live forever, leading the Chinese people from victory to greater victory."

    我要永远和毛主席在一起
    在战斗的越南南方，人们对我们伟大领袖毛主席怀着无比的深情和热爱。
    有一位南越解放军的营指挥员在离开家乡的时候，就把一张毛主席像带在身上。他经历过成百次战斗，一直把毛主席像珍藏在身上。当一个中国记者去访问他的时候，他郑重地从日记本里把这张毛主席像取出来，激动地说：“五年多了，在革命斗争的风雨里，在反美斗争的最前线，我日日夜夜和毛主席在一起！今后，我要永远和毛主席在一起，让毛主席看到越南祖国统一，革命彻底胜利！”
    有一位南越缝纫女工生下了第一个孩子，为这个新生的孩子取个什么有意义的名字呢？这位女工千想万想，最后决定孩子的名字叫“越华”。她还请一位中国同志替小“越华”拍摄了第一张照片，并且把这张照片带到北京。她说：“我要让我的孩子从小就爱中国，爱毛主席；让他知道，在中国，在东方，在全世界革命人民的心里，升起了一轮鲜红鲜红的太阳。”
    有一次在长山山脉的密林里，南越解放军同中国同志举行篝火晚会。战士们拍着手、唱着歌，庆祝战斗胜利。当中国同志谈到毛主席身体很健康，不久前出席了天安门前举行的支援越南人民抗美救国斗争的大会时，全场立即响起了“毛主席万岁！”的口号声。一位女战士代表大家说：“感谢毛主席，祝毛伯伯万寿无疆，领导中国人民从胜利走向更大胜利。”
