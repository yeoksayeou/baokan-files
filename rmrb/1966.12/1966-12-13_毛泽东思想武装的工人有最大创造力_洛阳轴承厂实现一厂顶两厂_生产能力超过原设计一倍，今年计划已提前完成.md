Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the greatest creativity. The Luoyang Bearing Factory achieves the production capacity of two factories with one. Production capacity exceeds the original design by one fold, and this year's plan has been completed ahead of schedule.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Zhengzhou, during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers at the Luoyang Bearing Factory have been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, further breaking down foreign frameworks, and resolutely forging their own path of industrial development. This year, the workers of this factory have completed a batch of technical projects with advanced standards of the 1960s, completing the state plan ahead of schedule and exceeding it. The output, variety, and quality have all significantly increased compared to last year. Currently, the comprehensive production capacity of this factory has exceeded the original design by one fold, achieving the production capacity of two factories with one.

The practice of the Luoyang Bearing Factory this year once again powerfully proves that production relies on people, people rely on the revolutionization of their thoughts, and the revolutionization of people's thoughts relies on being armed with Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, any difficulty can be overcome, any miracle can be created, and any scientific and technological peak can be scaled.

The forging workshop previously used foreign-made flat forging machines to produce bearing rings, requiring two or three continuous forging strikes to produce a single forging. The bourgeois "authorities" praised such equipment as the most advanced in the world. However, the workers said that this equipment is not only bulky but also has low efficiency and poor quality, failing to meet production needs. What is considered advanced? They decided to forge a new method of forging on their own. During the experiment, the workers, taking Yugong as an example, faced difficulties and learned from Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They continuously enhanced their courage and confidence to overcome difficulties. After dozens of experiments, they finally created a new forging process on a self-made press, achieving the production of two forgings with a single strike. This press can replace two foreign flat forging machines, and the product quality is also better than that produced by the flat forging machine. This year, six of the technical innovation projects realized in this workshop have reached domestic and international advanced technological levels.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of workers at the Luoyang Bearing Factory have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. This year, the entire factory has realized over 700 major and medium technical innovation projects, some of which have reached the advanced standards of the 1960s.

    毛泽东思想武装的工人有最大创造力
    洛阳轴承厂实现一厂顶两厂
    生产能力超过原设计一倍，今年计划已提前完成
    据新华社郑州电在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，洛阳轴承厂广大职工活学活用毛主席著作，进一步大破洋框框，坚决走自己工业发展道路。今年，这个厂的工人拿下了一批具有六十年代先进水平的技术项目，提前超额完成了国家计划，产量、品种、质量都比去年有较大幅度的增长和提高。现在，这个厂的综合生产能力已超过原设计的一倍，实现了一厂顶两厂。
    洛阳轴承厂今年的实践再一次有力地证明，生产靠人，人靠思想革命化，人的思想革命化靠毛泽东思想武装。有了毛泽东思想，什么困难都能战胜，什么奇迹都能创造，什么科学技术高峰都能攀登。
    锻工车间过去用外国造的平锻机生产轴承套圈，要连续锻打两次或三次才能生产出一个锻件。资产阶级“权威”把这种设备吹嘘为世界上最先进的设备。但是工人们说，这种设备既笨重，效率又低，质量又差，满足不了生产的需要，算得什么先进！他们决定自己闯出一条锻造的新方法。在试验过程中，工人们以愚公为榜样，遇到困难，就学习毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”不断增强战胜困难的勇气和信心。他们经过数十次试验，终于在自己制造的一台压力机上，创出套锻新工艺，实现了一次锻打就可以生产出两个锻件。这台压力机可以顶上两台洋平锻机，产品质量也比平锻机生产的好。今年，这个车间实现的技术革新项目中，就有六项达到了国内外先进技术水平。
    洛阳轴承厂的广大职工，在毛泽东思想的指引下，发扬无产阶级革命精神，今年全厂已实现大、中技术革新项目七百多项，其中有些具有六十年代先进水平。
