Macau and Hong Kong compatriots severely warn the Portuguese authorities: the great Chinese people cannot be insulted. They strongly condemn the Portuguese authorities' continued massacre of our patriotic compatriots.

New China News Agency, Guangzhou, December 7th: According to news from Macau and Hong Kong, after the Portuguese authorities in Macau committed fascist bloody atrocities on the 3rd and 4th, they again deployed a large number of armed military police on the streets on the 5th to set up defenses and open fire at will. The number of Macau compatriots arrested and imprisoned reached forty to fifty people.

Currently, the Portuguese authorities in Macau are still imposing martial law in Macau, filling the entire city with a white terror atmosphere. The lives and property of Macau compatriots are still under serious threat.

According to reports, in the bloody atrocities committed by the Portuguese authorities in Macau on the 3rd and 4th, 107 patriotic compatriots in Macau were killed or injured, with 7 dead and 100 injured. Because the Portuguese authorities in Macau sent "ambulances" following the armored cars during their rampage, they took away the bodies of our compatriots who were shot and killed along the way, attempting to destroy evidence, so the number of casualties in the incident cannot be fully accounted for. In addition, many residents are still missing and their whereabouts are unknown.

While deploying tanks, armored vehicles, and armed military police to impose martial law, many Portuguese military police also looted everywhere. They broke into bakeries, pointed their guns at the staff, and forcibly took away the bread. After the fruit stall keepers were driven away, they looted the fruits.

The fascist atrocities of the Portuguese imperialists have aroused the extreme indignation of our patriotic compatriots in Macau and Hong Kong. Various trade unions, associations, schools, and prominent figures in Macau and Hong Kong have strongly protested to the Portuguese authorities in Macau. They pointed out that all the bloody incidents were premeditated, planned, and organized by the Portuguese authorities. The patriotic compatriots in Macau and Hong Kong absolutely cannot tolerate such heinous crimes by Portuguese imperialism. They severely warn the Portuguese authorities: the Chinese people cannot be insulted, and blood debts must be repaid with blood! All serious consequences arising from this must be fully borne by the Portuguese authorities. Hong Kong compatriots also expressed their resolute support for the just struggle of Macau compatriots, vowing not to rest until victory is achieved!

    澳门香港同胞严厉警告澳葡当局：
    伟大的中国人民不可侮
    怒斥澳葡当局继续屠杀我爱国同胞的罪行
    新华社广州七日电　据澳门和香港消息：澳门葡萄牙当局在三日和四日连续制造屠杀澳门爱国同胞的法西斯血腥暴行之后，五日又出动大批武装军警上街布防，任意开枪，澳门同胞被拘捕入狱的竟达四五十人。
    目前，澳门葡萄牙当局仍然在澳门实行武装戒严，使整个澳门充满了白色恐怖的气氛。澳门同胞的生命财产安全，仍处于严重威胁之中。
    据报道，在三日和四日澳门葡萄牙当局制造的血腥暴行中，有一百零七名澳门爱国同胞被打死打伤，其中死亡七人，受伤的一百人。由于澳门葡萄牙当局行凶时派出“救护”车跟随在装甲车之后，沿路把被枪击伤亡的我澳门同胞的尸体抢走，企图毁尸灭迹，因此血案中死伤人数至今还无法作出完全的统计。另外还有不少居民失踪，至今生死不明。
    澳门葡萄牙当局在出动坦克车、装甲车和武装军警实行武装戒严的同时，许多葡籍军警还四处劫掠。他们闯入面包店，把枪口指着店员，强行抢走面包。看守水果摊的摊贩被赶走后，他们又大肆抢劫水果。
    澳葡帝国主义者的法西斯暴行，激起了我澳门和香港爱国同胞的无比愤慨。澳门和香港各工会、社团、学校以及各界知名人士，纷纷向澳门葡萄牙当局提出最强烈的抗议。他们指出，全部血腥案件是澳葡当局有预谋、有计划、有组织地制造出来的。澳门和香港的爱国同胞绝对不能容忍澳葡帝国主义这种滔天罪行。他们严厉警告澳葡当局：中国人民不可侮，血债一定要用血偿还！由此而产生的一切严重后果，澳葡当局必须负完全责任。香港同胞还表示坚决支持澳门同胞的正义斗争，不获胜利，决不罢休！
