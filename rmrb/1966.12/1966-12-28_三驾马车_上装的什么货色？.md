In 1964, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the Peking opera world sounded the call for revolution. Workers, peasants, and soldiers took to the stage, while emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties were kicked off. This was a major event of epoch-making significance, highly praised and warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers at home and abroad. However, the old gentlemen of the Ministry of Culture, who were in charge of "emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties," gnashed their teeth in hatred, determined to maintain the old Peking opera and strangle the revolutionary Peking opera. To "cultivate" their successors of the capitalist and revisionist line in the drama school, they proposed the so-called "three-horse carriage" (traditional plays, historical plays, and modern plays) as a "guiding" policy, throwing out absurd slogans such as "traditional as the foundation" and "rhyming and dialogue changed to Peking opera dialogue," opposing the revolution of Peking opera. They also used so-called "retained plays" to squeeze out the important position of modern plays in teaching. Until last year, they still insisted on using those ghost plays, traitor plays, and plays that propagate feudal morality for teaching, while the proportion of teaching and performing modern plays was very small. They openly told the students: "They can change theirs, you still use *The Second Conquest of the Palace* as the foundation." Under the pretext of "practicing" and "laying the foundation," they performed old plays like *The Banquet at San Guan* and were ready to revive the plays of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties at any time. They even openly shouted: "Do not forget the basic skills of traditional plays, and you can perform them whenever you want." It is clear that the so-called "three-horse carriage" they advocate is actually the horse of "traditional plays" and the carriage of "historical plays" they want, selling feudalist and capitalist ideas, and taking the road back. They oppose revolutionary modern plays and sing a different tune from Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought. This fully exposes the ugly face of the old Ministry of Culture in opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

    “三驾马车”上装的什么货色？
    中国戏曲学校　王显和　李金红
    一九六四年，在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，京剧界吹起了革命化的号角，工农兵占领了舞台，帝王将相、才子佳人从舞台上滚了出去。这是一件具有划时代意义的大事情，受到国内外广大工农兵和革命群众的高度评价和热情赞扬。但旧文化部这个“帝王将相、才子佳人部”的资产阶级老爷们却咬牙切齿，怀恨在心，拚命维护旧京剧，拚命扼杀革命京剧。为了在戏曲学校“培养”他们的资本主义、修正主义路线的“接班人”，他们提出所谓“三驾马车”（传统剧、历史剧、现代剧）的“指导”方针，抛出“传统打基础”“韵白改京白”等荒谬口号，对抗京剧革命，还用所谓“保留剧目”来排挤现代剧在教学上的重要地位。直到去年，他们还坚持用那些鬼戏、汉奸戏、宣扬封建道德的戏来教学，而现代剧的教学和演出占的比例却很小。他们对学生公开说：“他们改他们的，你们照样拿《二进宫》打基础。”他们以“练功”“打基础”为名，大演《三关排宴》等旧戏，随时准备让这些帝王将相、才子佳人戏复活。他们甚至公开叫嚷：“不要忘了传统戏的基本功，什么时候演，都拿得起来。”可见，他们宣扬的所谓“三驾马车”，实际上他们要的是“传统戏”的马，要的是“历史剧”的车，贩卖的是封建主义、资本主义的思想，走的是回头路。他们反对革命现代戏，同毛主席的文艺思想唱对台戏。这就充分暴露了旧文化部反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的丑恶嘴脸。
