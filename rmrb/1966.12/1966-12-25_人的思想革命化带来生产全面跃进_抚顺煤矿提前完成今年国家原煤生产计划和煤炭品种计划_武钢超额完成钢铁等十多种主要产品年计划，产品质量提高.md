According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 23rd: The workers of Fushun Coal Mine, through the great socialist education movement and the Cultural Revolution, have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Articles," promoting the revolutionization of people's thoughts, and stimulating people's enthusiasm and creativity, thus ensuring the comprehensive leap in production throughout the mine area.

By December 7th, Fushun Coal Mine had completed this year's national raw coal production plan ahead of schedule. The coal variety plan was also well completed. The quality of coal supplied to central and local enterprises has been greatly improved. The quantity and quality of coking coal supplied to the steel industry and lump coal needed by the chemical industry have also met the national plan. The labor efficiency of the entire workforce has significantly increased compared to last year, and the unit cost of raw coal has been reduced. The profits remitted to the state have exceeded this year's plan by more than one hundred percent.

Since this year, the broad revolutionary workers of Fushun Coal Mine have regarded the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the first need in life. Workers have deeply felt through the socialist education movement and the Cultural Revolution that Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, our red sun in our hearts, more important than air and food. In response to the situation where the old mine area workers are scattered and live far from the mine, making it difficult to study and discuss, the workers of various factories and mines under Fushun Coal Mine participated in the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" style training class, focusing on studying Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Articles," and implementing a collective living and learning system. The broad miners regard the "Three Articles" as the basic course, studying to eliminate self-interest and establish public interest, and working hard on transforming their worldview. They learn from Zhang Zedong's spirit of completely and thoroughly serving the people and Norman Bethune's selfless and dedicated character, adding boundless strength. Therefore, in production, they are not afraid of dirt, not afraid of hard work, take on difficulties, and take risks. Wherever there is a need, they go, and wherever there are difficulties, they charge in.

At present, the broad workers of Fushun Coal Mine are working harder to strive for more and better coal for the country and are actively preparing for next year's production work.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 24th: The broad revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel and Iron Company, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's instructions to combine revolution with production, have turned the revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed in the Cultural Revolution into production, bravely shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production, and fighting a brilliant battle on both the ideological and material fronts, achieving good results in this year's production. By mid-December, Wuhan Steel and Iron Company had fully exceeded the plan for more than ten major products this year, including steel, iron, coke, steel billets, and refractory materials. Among them, steel production increased by 34% compared to last year, and iron production increased by 67%. The quality of various major products has been significantly improved, the variety has increased significantly, and the cost has been reduced. These achievements are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought and the fruits of the Cultural Revolution.

Since this year, the broad revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel and Iron Company, with deep love for our great leader Chairman Mao and deep loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, have earnestly and diligently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, promoting the revolutionization of thoughts, making the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the entire company reach a new high, a new situation, and a new level. Each class studies before work, applies during work, and evaluates after work, openly sharing thoughts without fear of embarrassment, fiercely fighting against selfishness without fear of pain, and taking action without fear of difficulty, achieving immediate results in thought reform. The workers' spiritual outlook has greatly improved, and the production situation has gotten better month by month, presenting a lively revolutionary scene and a production upsurge.

At present, the broad revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel and Iron Company are following Chairman Mao's teachings, using the method of one divides into two, summarizing achievements, checking shortcomings, and preparing for next year's production work, striving for greater victories on both the ideological and material fronts next year.
