The Ninth Flight Squadron, Second Platoon of the Xinjiang Civil Aviation Management Bureau, has adopted the method of distributing Chairman Mao's quotations to help comrades solve ideological issues, with significant results.

During a sheep transport mission, because the flight volume was relatively large, Platoon Leader Cai Dehe became impatient and his work became somewhat chaotic. Pilot Li Youzhi noticed this and gave him a quotation from Chairman Mao: "We need a passionate yet calm mood, tense yet orderly work." After studying this quotation, Cai Dehe felt enlightened. Following Chairman Mao's instructions, he prepared thoroughly for the flight, overcame the chaos, and ensured that the work proceeded in a tense yet orderly manner.

The crew led by Li Chaojun made a mistake during a flight mission. Co-pilot Jing Huabao was under a lot of mental pressure. In response to this situation, before the crew's evaluation, the platoon leader and deputy political instructor each gave the crew a quotation from Chairman Mao. One was: "After people experience failure, they learn from failure, correct their thoughts to conform to the laws of the external world, and thus turn failure into victory. The saying 'failure is the mother of success' and 'a setback is a stepping stone to success' is based on this principle." The other was: "Our comrades should see achievements and see the light when facing difficulties, and raise our morale." Before the evaluation, the platoon's cadres and all the pilots studied these two quotations together, examined the reasons for the mistake, drew lessons from it, and formulated measures to improve the work. Comrades said: The actions of the platoon cadres are like 'sending coal in snow,' boosting our courage to correct mistakes. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works and truly act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

    有的放矢赠送毛主席语录  帮助同志解决思想问题
    新疆民航管理局第九飞行大队二中队，采取赠送毛主席语录的方法，帮助同志解决思想问题，收效很大。
    在一次运羊任务中，因为飞行量比较大，中队长柴德和产生了急躁情绪，工作有些忙乱。飞行员李有志发现后，便赠送给他一条毛主席语录：“我们需要的是热烈而镇定的情绪，紧张而有秩序的工作。”柴德和学习了这条语录以后，心里豁然开朗。按照毛主席的指示，他做好飞行前的准备工作，克服了忙乱现象，使工作进行得紧张而有秩序。
    李朝俊机组在执行航班任务时，出了一个差错。副驾驶景华宝，思想压力很大。针对这一情况，在机组讲评前，中队长和副教导员各送这个机组一条毛主席语录。一条是：“人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利，所谓‘失败者成功之母’，‘吃一堑长一智’，就是这个道理。”另一条是：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”讲评前，中队的领导干部和全组的飞行员，共同学习了这两条语录，检查了发生差错的原因，从中汲取了教训，并制定了改进工作的措施。同志们都说：中队干部的行动，是“雪中送炭”，提高了我们修正错误的勇气。我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，真正按照毛主席的指示办事。
