We are filled with excitement as we repeatedly and seriously study the speeches given by central leaders at the Cultural Revolution conference of the proletarian cultural revolution in the capital's literary and artistic circles. We have a clearer understanding of the direction of our struggle. We will definitely not disappoint the expectations of the central leaders. We must thoroughly expose and criticize the crimes of the former Propaganda Department, the former Ministry of Culture, the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and a small handful of capitalist-roaders within our troupe and the bourgeois "authorities."

The Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1 has long been a bastion of emperors, generals, and talented scholars and beauties. This bastion is an important tool used by the former Municipal Committee to attempt a capitalist restoration. They have long controlled this position, implementing a complete set of counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic lines, stubbornly opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

Our troupe truly accepted the glorious task of Peking Opera reform under the guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing. The breach in this feudal bastion was also opened by Comrade Jiang Qing leading us. I remember when Comrade Jiang Qing first met with some of our young actors, she solemnly told us: "Today, our stage still performs ghost plays and emperors and generals. Can this still be called people's democratic dictatorship? Why are there so few audiences in your theater? Are there any young people? Your performances of old plays are completely detached from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers." We were greatly educated and inspired by Comrade Jiang Qing's words. We unanimously expressed our willingness to perform revolutionary modern plays and to carry out the revolution of Peking Opera, returning to the correct path indicated by Chairman Mao. Thus, under Comrade Jiang Qing's direct care, we began rehearsing "Red Detachment of Women."

However, during this process, the main responsible person of the former Beijing Municipal Committee obstructed us in every way. They fiercely opposed our performance of revolutionary modern plays, advocating the continued performance of old plays, and absurdly saying, "What reason is there not to perform traditional plays? Universities and middle schools still teach history, so we can walk on two legs, right!" After the performance of "Red Detachment of Women," they organized traditional plays to perform, gathering a group of old reactionaries to praise them highly, creating the public opinion that "modern plays are not as good as traditional plays" to oppose Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line.

After the performance of "Red Detachment of Women," to strive for perfection, Comrade Jiang Qing helped us make major revisions and improvements, mainly emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing the great significance of people's war and armed struggle, and strengthening military-civilian relations. In terms of characters, she emphasized the heroic images of New Fourth Army political commissar Guo Jianguang and others. However, the main responsible person of the former Beijing Municipal Committee and some main members of our old party branch committee colluded, using two-faced and three-cornered tactics to sabotage the rehearsal of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy." They used various despicable means to resist and oppose the emphasis on Mao Zedong Thought and the creation of positive heroic characters. They brought out the reactionary theories of the Zhou Yang clique: such as "heroes also have flaws," to distort our great New Fourth Army heroes. Those stinking "authorities" to sabotage revolutionary modern plays, if they couldn't come to rehearsals, they wouldn't come. Sometimes changing a word, a singing tune, or a movement was quite difficult. They became the biggest obstacles on our path forward. But these did not frighten us. The more they resisted and obstructed, the more determined we were. Comrade Jiang Qing once asked us, "Are you afraid of changes?" We said, "We are not afraid of changes, and we will definitely improve the play." Under Comrade Jiang Qing's guidance, we were not afraid of hardships, not afraid of fatigue, not afraid of setbacks, and were willing to pay the greatest price to rehearse and perform revolutionary modern plays well. Because we knew this was for the proletarian literary and artistic cause, to let Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thoughts illuminate our socialist stage.

The revised "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" received high praise from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and they gave us great encouragement. We also went through this struggle and artistic practice, from which we gained tempering.

Recalling this struggle experience, we have even more confidence in performing revolutionary modern plays and carrying out the revolution of Peking Opera. We deeply feel that among all the principles, following Mao Zedong Thought is the first and foremost. Doing the revolution of Peking Opera, not for a moment can we be separated from the great Mao Zedong Thought. We feel very ashamed that due to our low level of consciousness, especially our insufficient study of Chairman Mao's works, and limited level of understanding, we did not follow Mao Zedong Thought closely enough. If we had followed more closely, we believe that the performance of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" would be even better.

In the future, we will definitely not disappoint the sincere expectations of the central leaders. We will definitely temper ourselves in the storms of class struggle. We will definitely follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin: study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, focus on the "use" aspect, under the direct leadership of the Military Commission, the General Political Department, and Comrade Jiang Qing, to well reform our worldview, and become a proletarian literary and artistic warrior who does not seek fame or wealth, is not afraid of hardships or death.

    京剧革命离不开毛泽东思想
    北京京剧一团　谭元寿　马长礼
    我们怀着激动的心情，反复认真地学习了中央领导同志在首都文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会上的讲话。我们更加明确了斗争的大方向。我们一定不辜负中央领导同志对我们的期望，一定要彻底揭发批判旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委，以及我们剧团内一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级臭“权威”的种种反党罪行。
    北京京剧一团，是一个长期上演帝王将相、才子佳人的封建堡垒。这个堡垒就是旧市委妄图进行资本主义复辟的重要工具。他们长期地统治着这个阵地，实行着一整套的反革命修正主义文艺路线，顽固地与毛主席革命文艺路线相对抗。
    我们剧团真正接受京剧改革这一光荣任务，是在江青同志指导下开始的。北京京剧一团这个封建堡垒的缺口，也是江青同志带领我们打开的。记得江青同志第一次接见我们一些青年演员的时候，严肃地对我们说：“我们今天舞台上还演鬼戏，还演帝王将相，这还算得上什么人民民主专政？为什么你们剧场观众这样少？有青年人没有？你们演老戏完全是脱离了广大工农兵群众。”我们听了江青同志这一段话，受到很大教育和启发。我们一致表示愿意演革命现代戏，愿意搞京剧革命，回到毛主席指出的正确道路上来。于是，在江青同志直接关怀下，我们开始排练《芦荡火种》。
    但是，在这个过程中，旧北京市委主要负责人却百般阻挠。他们疯狂反对我们演革命现代戏，主张继续演老戏，胡说什么“有什么理由不演传统戏呢？大学中学还上历史课呢，可以两条腿走路嘛！”《芦荡火种》上演之后，他们还拚命组织传统戏演出，纠集了一伙遗老遗少为他们大捧特捧，制造“现代戏不如传统戏”的舆论来同毛主席的文艺路线相对抗。
    《芦荡火种》演出之后，为了精益求精，江青同志又帮助我们作重大修改和加工，最主要的是突出毛泽东思想，突出人民战争和武装斗争的伟大意义，加强军民关系。在人物方面突出新四军指导员郭建光等英雄形象。但是旧北京市委主要负责人和我团旧党总支一些主要成员，互相勾结，阴一套，阳一套，用两面三刀的手法破坏《沙家浜》的排演。他们采取种种卑鄙的手段进行抵制和反对突出毛泽东思想，反对塑造正面的英雄人物。他们搬出周扬一伙的资产阶级反动理论：什么“英雄人物也不是没有缺点的”等等，来歪曲我们伟大的新四军英雄形象。那些臭“权威”们为了破坏革命现代戏，说不来排戏就不来排戏，说不干就躺倒不干。有时修改一个字，一句唱腔，一个动作都是相当难的。他们成了我们前进道路上的最大的障碍。但是这些都没有吓倒我们，他们越是抗拒抵制，我们的干劲就越足。江青同志曾经问过我们：“你们怕不怕改？”我们说：“不怕改，一定要把戏改好。”我们在江青同志的教导下，不怕苦，不怕累，不怕受挫折，用最大的代价也要把革命现代戏排好、演好。因为我们知道这是为了无产阶级的文艺事业，是让毛主席文艺思想的光辉照亮我们社会主义的舞台。
    修改后的《沙家浜》，得到广大工农兵和革命群众的好评，他们给予了我们极大的鼓舞。我们也通过这场斗争实践和艺术实践，从中得到了锻炼。
    回忆这段斗争经历，使我们更加增强了大演革命现代戏、搞京剧革命的信心。我们深深地体会到，千条万条，紧跟毛泽东思想是第一条。干京剧革命，一时一刻也不能离开伟大的毛泽东思想。我们觉得很惭愧，由于觉悟不高，特别是学习毛主席著作很不够，认识水平有限，因此紧跟毛泽东思想不够。如果能跟得更紧一些，相信《沙家浜》的演出会比现在更好。
    今后我们一定不辜负中央领导同志对我们的殷切期望，一定在阶级斗争的风浪里锻炼。我们一定按照林副主席的指示：活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，在军委、总政治部和江青同志的直接领导下，很好地改造世界观，做一个不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死的无产阶级文艺战士。
