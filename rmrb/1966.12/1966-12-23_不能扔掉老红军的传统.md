A classmate threw away a somewhat intact umbrella on the road. A soldier picked it up and, braving the wind and rain, walked several miles to return it to us. He said:

Do Not Abandon the Traditions of the Old Red Army

On November 12th, the weather was gloomy and rainy. We were marching north along the railway line. Suddenly, a speeding train passed by, creating a strong gust of wind that tore several of our classmates' umbrellas. One classmate threw a still somewhat intact umbrella to the side of the road.

In the evening, we were resting in the reception station in Guzhen when the staff informed us that a soldier was looking for us outside. We went out to see a soldier holding an umbrella, his body soaked from the rain. As soon as he saw us, he introduced himself, saying he was a soldier on duty at the railway bridge ahead. He had picked up this somewhat intact umbrella from the side of the road and, seeing the words on the umbrella handle, knew it belonged to the Long March team. After getting off duty, he braved the wind and rain to walk four miles to the reception station to find the classmate who had lost the umbrella.

"That broken umbrella wasn't dropped; I threw it away. I don't want it," the classmate who had thrown away the umbrella said sheepishly.

"This umbrella isn't completely broken; why don't you want it?" the soldier asked.

"It's broken and inconvenient to use, and it's hard to carry," our classmate replied.

The soldier smiled and said kindly, "Aren't you the Long March team? Long March isn't just about learning the long-distance marching of the old Red Army; it's also about learning their spirit of hard work and self-reliance. I think the old Red Army soldiers would never throw away an umbrella like this. With a little repair, it can still be used." He paused and then said, "Throwing away this broken umbrella seems like a small matter, but abandoning the glorious tradition of hard work and self-reliance of the old Red Army is a big deal!"

The soldier's heartfelt words moved everyone. The classmate felt even more ashamed and took the umbrella from the soldier's hands, saying, "Thank you, soldier, for your help." As we parted, we promised the soldier that on the Long March, we would learn from the old Red Army and inherit and carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of the old Red Army.

From then on, the spirit of hard work and self-reliance in our Long March team was further promoted. Classmates no longer casually threw away usable items. Everyone carried a small sewing kit, mended their own shoes and socks, and repaired their own clothes. We also proposed measures to learn from the old Red Army's traditions: doing good deeds along the way, not fearing the cold, picking up small parts like screws scattered near the railway to save national resources. Everyone was determined to inherit the glorious traditions of the old Red Army and become good little red guards of Chairman Mao.

### 不能扔掉老红军的传统

    一个同学，在路上把一把还不怎么破的伞扔掉了。一位解放军战士拾到以后，冒着风雨走了几里路，把它送还给了我们。他说：
    不能扔掉老红军的传统
    十一月十二日，天气阴沉，下着雨，我们沿着铁路线往北行进。
    忽然，一列急驰的列车从我们身旁飞奔而过，卷过一阵大风，把几个同学的雨伞都刮破了。有一个同学就把一把还不怎么破的伞扔到了路边。
    傍晚，我们正在固镇的接待站里休息，工作人员告诉我们，门外有一位解放军同志找我们。出去一看，一位解放军同志，手里拿着一把伞，身上已经被雨淋湿了。他一见到我们，就自我介绍说，他是在前面铁路桥边值勤的战士，从路边拾到了这把还不怎么破的雨伞，从伞柄上写的字来看，知道是长征队同学们的。下班以后，他就冒着风雨走了四里路来到接待站，寻找这位丢伞的同学。
    “这把破伞不是掉的，是我扔的，我不要了。”那位扔伞的同学不好意思地说。
    “这把伞不是还能用么，干嘛不要它呀？”解放军战士说。
    “破啦，用起来不方便，又不好带。”我们的同学回答说。
    解放军战士听到这里，笑了笑，很和气地说：“你们不是长征队么？长征，不光要学当年老红军那样的长途行军，还要学老红军艰苦奋斗的精神。我看，像这样一把不算怎么破的伞，当年的老红军战士是绝对不会扔掉的，修一修不是还能用么？”停了一停，他又说，“你们把这把破伞扔了，看来好像是小事，可是扔掉了老红军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，这可是一件大事啊！”
    解放军同志这一段语重心长的话，大家听了都很受感动。那位同学更是感到惭愧，他用双手从解放军战士手里接过伞说，谢谢解放军同志的帮助。分别时，我们向解放军同志保证：在长征路上一定要向老红军学习，继承和发扬老红军的光荣革命传统。
    从此以后，我们长征队里艰苦奋斗的作风进一步发扬了，同学们再也不随便扔掉一些能用的东西。每人都备了一个针线包，鞋袜自己补，破衣自己缝。我们还提出了学习老红军传统的一些措施：沿路做好事，不怕寒冷，捡拾散落在铁路附近的螺丝钉等小零件，为国家节约财富。同学们个个决心把老红军的光荣传统继承下来，做一个毛主席的好红小兵。
