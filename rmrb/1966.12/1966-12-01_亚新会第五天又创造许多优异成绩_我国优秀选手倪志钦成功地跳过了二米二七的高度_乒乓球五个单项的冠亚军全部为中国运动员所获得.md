According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Phnom Penh on the 30th, seven events of the first Asian New Forces Games have been completed. Over the past five days, athletes from various countries have worked together, helping each other, and have created a large number of excellent results.

Today, exciting news came from the track and field competition: China's outstanding athlete Ni Zhiqun successfully cleared a height of 2.27 meters, breaking his own national record of 2.26 meters set in May this year and the New Forces Games record. His performance is just one centimeter short of the world record of 2.28 meters and is the best in the world in the past three years. Today, Ni Zhiqun was full of fighting spirit. When the bar was raised to 2.27 meters, he loudly recited a passage from Chairman Mao: "All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must never relax their fighting spirit. Any thought of relaxing the fighting spirit or being complacent is wrong." He then told his comrades, "I must make up my mind to strive for victory." With a very coordinated motion, he cleared the bar.

    今天，田径比赛场上传出了令人振奋的消息：中国优秀选手倪志钦成功地跳过了二米二七的高度，打破了他在今年五月所创造的二米二六的全国最好成绩和新运会纪录。他的这个成绩比二米二八的世界纪录仅差一厘米，是近三年来世界最好的成绩。今天，倪志钦斗志昂扬，当横杆升到二米二七的时候，他高声朗读了毛主席的一段话：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”接着，他对自己同伴说：“我一定要下定决心，去争取胜利。”他以非常协调的过杆动作，征服了这个高度。这时，全场掌声雷动，观众向这位对第一届亚洲新运会做出新贡献的中国选手热烈欢呼。
