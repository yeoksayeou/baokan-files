Letters from Abroad

Marxist-Leninists Must Study Chairman Mao's Works

Currently, within the global arena, genuine revolutionaries are distinguishing themselves from those who claim to be revolutionary but in reality betray the people. Marxist-Leninists in every country must arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong's works are the most beneficial and important weapons for our political struggles and ideological work. I am determined to study Chairman Mao's works more deeply, to arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought, and to serve the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly.

Chairman Mao's Works Give Me Great Strength and Courage

Chairman Mao's works are profound yet easy to understand, and the more you read, the more you are drawn to them. Articles like "Qu Fuming Moves Mountains" are simple and easy to understand, but they contain profound truths. Every night before I go to sleep and every morning when I wake up, I read Chairman Mao's works to review the day's events and guide my work. Each time I read Chairman Mao's works, they give me great strength and courage.

Learning Communist Spirit from Chairman Mao's Works

Under the great and wise leadership of Chairman Mao, China has become a happy and prosperous country, and the future of the Chinese people is bright. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people will achieve even greater successes. Whenever I have the time, I study Chairman Mao's works. Most importantly, I have learned from Chairman Mao's works the spirit of "loving the people," "having no selfishness or personal gain," and true communism.

    现在，在全世界范围内，真正的革命者同口头上革命实际上背叛人民的修正主义者正在分化。各国真正的马克思列宁主义者必须用毛泽东思想武装起来。毛泽东的著作是我们进行政治斗争和思想工作最有益、最重要的武器。我决心更进一步学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己，完全彻底地为人民服务。

    毛主席著作给我极大的力量和勇气
    毛主席的著作都是深入浅出的，越读越吸引人读下去。像《愚公移山》这样的文章，虽然简单易懂，但里面却富有深刻的道理。我每天睡觉之前和早晨起来，都要读毛主席的著作，来检查一天的情况和指导一天的工作。每次读毛主席的著作都给我带来极大的力量和勇气。
