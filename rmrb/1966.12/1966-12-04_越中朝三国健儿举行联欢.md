Athletes from Vietnam, China, and North Korea held a gala event today. The New China News Agency reported from Phnom Penh on the 2nd that athletes from Vietnam, China, and North Korea participating in the First New Emerging Forces Games gathered at the residence of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's representative team in Phnom Penh to hold a gala event.

The gala was presided over by Nguyen Van Luong, the head of the Vietnamese sports delegation. Huang Zhong, the head of the Chinese sports delegation, and Cho Gye-hui, the deputy head of the North Korean sports delegation, attended the gala.

Chen Shulian, the Chinese ambassador to Cambodia, Nguyen Thoan, the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's representative to Cambodia, and Han Shin-hee, the acting charge d'affaires of the North Korean Democratic People's Republic embassy in Cambodia, were also invited to attend the gala.

The three countries' athletes gathered together, sharing friendship and exchanging experiences. Vietnamese table tennis player Huynh Thi Hong asked Chinese table tennis player Zhuang Zedong to write a message on a tapestry depicting the struggle of the people in South Vietnam. Zhuang Zedong neatly wrote, "Vietnam-China Friendship Lasts Forever." Chinese women's high jumper Zheng Fengrong and North Korean female athlete Shin Kumdan sat together, discussing the situation of this competition and congratulating each other on the victories they had already achieved.

The accompaniment music started, and the athletes from the three countries sang songs praising friendship and unity, demonstrating the unbreakable brotherly unity and anti-American imperialist fighting spirit among the peoples of the three countries.

The gala concluded with the screening of the Vietnamese documentary "Heroic Hon Giao Island." When the screen showed the heroic Vietnamese military and civilians shooting down American aggressor planes, the entire audience erupted in enthusiastic applause.
