The people of Yulin District in Shaanxi Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and launched a large-scale campaign for agricultural land construction. They overcame a severe drought that lasted fourteen months and achieved a bumper autumn harvest. From May last year to June this year, the region experienced a once-in-a-century drought, with the total rainfall amounting to only one-third of the average annual rainfall.

In the face of the severe drought, the people of Yulin District waged a tenacious and heroic struggle. From last winter to this October, the district dug 5,000 wells and newly constructed 240,000 mu (approximately 16,000 hectares) of irrigated land, doubling the area of irrigated land compared to before liberation. This played a significant role in ensuring a bumper harvest. Although the summer harvest was reduced due to the drought, the autumn harvest of crops such as sorghum, proso millet, and maize was excellent. The total grain output for the year increased by nearly 40% compared to a normal year, achieving a bumper harvest.

    发扬自力更生艰苦奋斗精神
    榆林地区战胜干旱秋季丰收
    陕西省榆林地区的人民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，大搞农田基本建设，战胜了持续十四个月的大旱，夺得了今年秋季丰收。从去年五月到今年六月，这个地区又遇到了百年未见的大旱，总降雨量不及常年降雨量的三分之一。
    在大旱面前，榆林地区人民向干旱展开了英勇顽强的斗争。去冬到今年十月，全区共打水井五千眼，新修成水地（即水浇地）二十四万亩，等于解放前水地面积的两倍，对保证丰收起了很大的作用。今年夏季虽然因旱减产，秋季的谷子、糜子、高粱等却获得大好收成。全年粮食总产量比平常年景增长了将近四成，获得了丰收。
