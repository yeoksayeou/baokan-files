More than 100,000 fishermen in the Shengshan Fishery have caught over 1.3 million dan of mackerel in the past month, an increase of about 10 percent compared to the same period last year.

Many fishermen have recently received copies of Chairman Mao's works, and they are all elated. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, they have displayed a spirit of fearlessness and perseverance, working day and night to pursue the fish schools, frequently going out to sea, and casting their nets more often, resulting in a significant increase in their catch.
