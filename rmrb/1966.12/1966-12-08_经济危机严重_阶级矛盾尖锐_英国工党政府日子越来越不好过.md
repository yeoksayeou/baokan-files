The Labour government, which has been in power for two years, is not only at a political dead end but is also in deep financial and economic crisis. The British newspaper *The Guardian* worriedly says that the British economy is "rapidly heading towards what appears to be the most severe recession since the end of World War II."

The particular severity of the current economic crisis in Britain lies in the simultaneous occurrence of a production crisis and a pound crisis. Under the influence of a series of austerity measures, the entire national economy is further declining. In the first half of this year, steel production decreased by 9% compared to the same period last year, and automobile production dropped by more than 10%.

As the lifeline of Britain, foreign trade has seen a deficit of 855 million pounds in the first nine months of this year. In recent years, with the decline of its strength, Britain has increasingly become a dumping ground for industrial products from the United States, Western Europe, and Japan. The worsening foreign trade situation has led to a huge deficit in Britain's foreign payments, causing a continuous outflow of gold and foreign exchange reserves. Therefore, Britain has had to rely on borrowing large amounts of foreign debt to get by. In October, Britain nominally had 1.149 billion pounds in gold and foreign exchange reserves, but it owed the United States and Western European countries 1.2 billion pounds, with all reserves not enough to cover the debt.

The British government actively follows the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism, complements the U.S. strategic focus on the East, and implements the so-called "policy east of Suez," spending a large amount of overseas military expenditures, further deepening Britain's economic difficulties. Britain's current overseas expenditures reach more than 500 million pounds per year, with the majority being military spending.

The emergency measures taken by the Labour government to alleviate the crisis, although numerous in name, are essentially the same, all aimed at cutting into the livelihood of the working people, freezing wages, and creating unemployment. In October, the unemployed reached 437,000, with nearly 100,000 added in one month, shocking the entire nation. It is predicted that the number of unemployed may reach one million this winter. Meanwhile, prices continue to rise, with over 3,100 food and daily necessities increasing in price in the first seven months of this year alone.

The economic policies of the Labour government have exacerbated class contradictions within the country. The working people are becoming increasingly impoverished. In cities large and small, there are homeless people, those who scavenge for a living, and even beggars on the streets everywhere. The people are filled with grievances, and strikes, protests, and demonstrations are becoming more frequent. As winter approaches and the people's movements develop, the Labour government's days will only get worse.

    经济危机严重　阶级矛盾尖锐
    英国工党政府日子越来越不好过
    据新华社伦敦电　上台已两年的英国工党政府，不但在政治上走投无路，而且在财政经济方面也陷入了深刻的危机。英国《卫报》忧心忡忡地说，英国
  “经济正在迅速地走向看来是第二次世界大战后最严重的衰退”。
    目前英国经济危机的特殊严重性还在于生产危机和英镑危机并发。在一系列紧缩措施的影响下，英国整个国民经济正在进一步衰落。今年上半年，钢产量比去年同期下降百分之九，汽车生产下降了百分之十以上。
    作为英国生命线的对外贸易，在今年头九个月出现了八亿五千五百万英镑的巨额赤字。近年来随着实力的衰落，英国日益成为美国、西欧和日本的工业品的倾销市场。对外贸易情况的恶化使英国对外支付产生了巨额赤字，黄金外汇储备源源不绝地大量外流。因此，英国不得不靠大借外债过日子。今年十月份，英国名义上虽然有十一亿四千九百万英镑的黄金外汇储备，但是欠美国和西欧国家的债达十二亿英镑，全部储备也不足抵债。
    英国政府积极追随美帝国主义的侵略与战争政策、配合美国的战略重点东移，而推行所谓“苏伊士以东”政策，耗费大量的海外军事开支，加深了英国经济上的困境。英国政府目前的海外开支每年达五亿多英镑，其中主要是军事开支。
    工党政府为缓和危机而采取的应急措施虽然名目繁多，但是万变不离其宗，无非是向劳动人民开刀，冻结工资，制造失业。十月份失业大军已达四十三万七千多人，在一个月里猛增近十万人，使全国为之震惊。人们预料，今年冬季，失业大军可能达到一百万。而物价却不断上涨，仅在今年头七个月，就有三千一百多种食品杂货涨价。
    工党政府的经济政策促使国内的阶级矛盾尖锐化。劳动人民日益贫困。在大小城市里，无家可归的、拾破烂糊口的、甚至沿街行乞的人到处都是。人民怨声载道，罢工、抗议、示威行动越来越多。随着冬天的临近和人民运动的开展，工党政府的日子将会越来越不好过。（附图片）
    美国食品价格不断上涨，各地的家庭妇女纷纷举行示威表示抗议。
