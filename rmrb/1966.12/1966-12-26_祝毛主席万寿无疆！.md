	Long Live Chairman Mao Forever!

	Not long ago, the China Acrobatics Troupe visited Nepal for a performance tour. During the performance, every time Chairman Mao's portrait appeared on stage accompanied by the melody of "The East Is Red," the audience immediately erupted in thunderous applause and stood up shouting, "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

	A spectator named Batari said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest and most correct. I will strive to study Chairman Mao's works." A spectator named Bacasabati Devkota wrote in the guest book, "Chairman Mao is the most trusted and greatest leader of the world's people." Another spectator named Sindunat Pikul wrote, "Chairman Mao is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of the world proletarian revolution." He concluded his message with the slogan "Long Live Chairman Mao!" which overflows with affection for Chairman Mao.

    祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    不久前，中国杂技艺术团到尼泊尔访问演出。在演出中，每当毛主席像随着《东方红》的乐曲声在舞台上出现时，观众立即发出暴风雨般的掌声，并且起立欢呼“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    一位名叫巴塔里的观众说：“毛泽东思想最伟大最正确。我要努力学习毛主席著作。”一位名叫巴查斯帕蒂·德夫科塔的观众在留言簿上写道：“毛主席是世界人民最信任的、最伟大的领袖。”另一位名叫辛杜纳特·皮库尔的观众写道：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的领袖，而且是全世界无产阶级革命的领袖。”他用“毛主席万岁！”这句洋溢着对毛主席敬爱心情的口号来作为他留言的结语。
