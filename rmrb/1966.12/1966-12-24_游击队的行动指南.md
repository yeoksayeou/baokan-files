Guerrilla fighters in Peru use the works of Chairman Mao as a powerful weapon in their struggle. Many guerrilla leaders carry Mao's works in their backpacks, especially his military writings. Whether in the midst of fierce battles or while working among Indian peasants, they frequently read Mao's works. They pay special attention to studying Mao's military theories.

A Peruvian friend said: "Latin American revolutionaries have personally experienced that Chairman Mao's works are applicable to the actual situation in Latin America. Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the characteristics of China, creatively formulated the theory of revolutionizing the countryside before the cities and surrounding the cities with the countryside. Latin American revolutionaries are applying this experience."

    游击队的行动指南
    在秘鲁，游击队员们把毛主席著作作为斗争的强大武器。许多游击队领导人的背包里都带有毛主席著作，特别是毛主席的军事著作。不论在战火纷飞的日子，或是在印第安农民中活动的时候，他们都经常阅读毛主席著作。他们尤其注意学习毛主席的军事理论。
    一位秘鲁朋友说：“拉丁美洲革命者亲身体会到毛主席著作的论述符合拉丁美洲的实际情况。毛泽东同志根据中国的特点，创造性地制定了中国革命先农村后城市，以农村包围城市的理论。拉丁美洲革命者正在应用着这条经验。”
