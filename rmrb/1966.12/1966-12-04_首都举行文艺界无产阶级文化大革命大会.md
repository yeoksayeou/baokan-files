The revolutionary army of arts and literature across the nation is advancing triumphantly along the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

A meeting on the proletarian cultural revolution in the arts was held in the capital on the evening of November 28, attended by over 20,000 revolutionary artists from the capital and various parts of the country. The meeting was held in the grand and magnificent Great Hall of the People, following Chairman Mao's eight consecutive receptions of over 11 million cultural revolutionaries and the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Premier Zhou Enlai, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Comrade Chen Boda, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Cultural Revolution Group of the CPC Central Committee, and Comrade Jiang Qing, deputy head of the Cultural Revolution Group of the CPC Central Committee and cultural advisor to the People's Liberation Army, attended the meeting and delivered important speeches. Central and local leaders, as well as over 20,000 revolutionary artists from the capital and various parts of the country, attended the meeting.

The meeting called on revolutionary artists across the nation to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to emphasize proletarian politics, to firmly implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, to unite on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform, and to strive to create the most brilliant proletarian new arts in human history. The Central Military Commission decided that Comrade Jiang Qing would serve as a cultural advisor to the People's Liberation Army, and that four arts troupes, including the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, would be incorporated into the PLA's organizational structure.

The following is a report by Xinhua News Agency on November 3:

In the wake of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao's eight consecutive receptions of over 11 million cultural revolutionaries, and in the midst of the great triumph of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, over 20,000 revolutionary artists from the capital and various parts of the country gathered in the grand and magnificent Great Hall of the People on the evening of November 28 to hold a meeting on the proletarian cultural revolution in the arts.

Comrade Chen Boda, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Cultural Revolution Group of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting and delivered the opening speech. He said:

Today's meeting is of great significance. Historically, cultural revolutions often begin with the arts. Our current proletarian cultural revolution is no exception.

Our proletarian cultural revolution is guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong has creatively developed Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic theories, using a proletarian worldview to systematically and thoroughly solve the problems on our literary and artistic front, and to open up a completely new path for the proletarian cultural revolution.

In 1962, at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Chairman Mao proposed that we must grasp the class struggle in the ideological realm. Under Chairman Mao's great call and the direct guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, a high tide of revolutionary reforms swept through Peking opera, ballet, symphonic music, and other fields, using ancient for modern, foreign for Chinese, and pushing the old to bring forth the new. Peking opera and other forms were used to express the epic of the masses' heroic struggle under the leadership of the Chinese proletariat. This new creation gave Peking opera, ballet, symphonic music, and other forms new life, not only with new content but also with significant innovations in form, changing their appearance. Revolutionary modern dramas appeared on our stages everywhere. This proletarian new art attracted the broad masses unprecedentedly. However, the reactionaries, the counter-revolutionary revisionists, cursed and hated it. Why? Because this new art would greatly enhance the political consciousness of the Chinese people, greatly strengthen our proletarian dictatorship and socialist system.

I want to say here that Comrade Jiang Qing has made special contributions in upholding this artistic revolutionary line and unyieldingly fighting against the reactionaries and counter-revolutionary revisionists.

History has shattered the dreams of the reactionaries and counter-revolutionary revisionists. The artistic revolution since the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee has become the true beginning of our proletarian cultural revolution.

The history of arts is filled with fierce conflicts. The conflicts between the new and the old, the modern and the ancient, all reflect the class struggles in society. The bourgeoisie in the revolutionary period used their new arts as an important weapon to overthrow the feudal system. Now, the proletariat must also use their new arts, which serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, as a weapon to overthrow the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. After the proletariat seizes power, the bourgeoisie does not willingly retreat from the stage of history. Chairman Mao often points out to us: the overthrown bourgeoisie uses various methods to attempt to use the artistic front as a breeding ground for corrupting the masses and preparing for the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, our task in the arts is not to lessen but to intensify. Our leadership in the arts should not weaken but strengthen. Our revolutionary arts troupes must carry out their glorious mission and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

As long as classes exist, denying the conflicts in the arts is completely wrong. In the future communist society, when classes are eliminated and class contradictions and class struggles no longer exist, there will still be conflicts between the new and the old, conflicts that we cannot fully foresee or may not be able to foresee, and these conflicts will also be reflected in the arts.

I will say these words as the opening speech for this arts meeting held in the midst of the proletarian cultural revolution.

Comrade Jiang Qing spoke in the midst of thunderous applause. She first greeted the comrades, friends, and Red Guards in the arts and extended proletarian revolutionary greetings to them.

Comrade Jiang Qing said in recounting her understanding of the proletarian cultural revolution that a few years ago, she systematically came into contact with a part of literature and art. First, she felt, why are there ghost plays on the stage of socialist China? Then, she was surprised to see that Peking opera was not very sensitive to reality, but there appeared plays like "The Dismissal of Hai Rui" and "The Ghost Story of Li Hui Mian" with such serious reactionary political tendencies, and there were even things called "excavating traditions," with many emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. Throughout the arts world, there was a lot of talk and performance about "fame," "foreign," and "ancient," filled with a foul air of revering the past and despising the present, admiring foreign and rejecting Chinese, and valuing the dead and despising the living. She began to feel that our literature and art could not adapt to the socialist economic base, and it would inevitably destroy the socialist economic base.

Comrade Jiang Qing said that over the years, with the changes in the new and old struggles in the fields of society, politics, and economics, new literature and art have also appeared in the field of literature and art to oppose the old literature and art. Even Peking opera, which is said to be the most difficult to reform, has produced new works. Everyone knows that more than thirty years ago, Lu Xun was the great leader of the cultural revolution. Chairman Mao proposed the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the problem of pushing the old to bring forth the new more than twenty years ago.

She said, pushing the old to bring forth the new means having new content that is of the people and forms that the people like. Many things cannot be pushed to bring forth the new, such as ghosts and gods. How can we inherit them critically? I think we cannot. Because we are atheists, we are communists, and we do not believe in the existence of ghosts and gods in the world. Again, for example, the feudal morality of the landlord class and the bourgeois morality, their so-called moral codes, are to oppress and exploit people. Can we inherit the things that oppress and exploit people critically? I think we cannot. Because we are a proletarian dictatorship country, we are building socialism, and our economic base is the public ownership system, firmly opposing the private ownership system that oppresses and exploits people. One important aspect of our proletarian cultural revolution is to sweep away all the remnants of the exploitative system and sweep away all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. She went on to say that regarding the old artistic forms, we should not take a nihilistic attitude, nor should we take a completely affirmative attitude. A nation always has its artistic forms and artistic characteristics. If we do not inherit the best artistic forms and characteristics of our motherland critically and take a nihilistic attitude, that is wrong. On the contrary, to affirm everything completely without any pushing the old to bring forth the new is also wrong. Regarding the excellent artistic forms of all peoples in the world, we should also do the work of pushing the old to bring forth the new according to Chairman Mao's instruction of "using foreign for Chinese."

Comrade Jiang Qing pointed out that imperialism is dying, parasitic, and decadent capitalism. Modern revisionism is a product of imperialist policies and a variant of capitalism. They can no longer produce any good works. Capitalism has been around for several hundred years, and their so-called "classic" works are only so much. Some of them imitate the so-called "classic" works and are rigid, unable to attract people, and thus completely declined; others are flooding in large quantities, poisoning and numbing the people with fly music, jazz, striptease, impressionism, symbolism, abstract art, fauvism, modernism, etc., with many tricks. In a word: decadent and vulgar, poisoning and numbing the people.

She said, ask: can the old literature and art adapt to the socialist economic base? Can the ancient artistic forms completely adapt to the socialist ideological content? Should we revolutionize? (The crowd shouted: Yes!) Should we reform? (The crowd shouted: Yes!) I believe that most comrades and friends will think that a revolution is needed, that a reform is needed, but this is a serious class struggle, and it is also a very meticulous and quite difficult task. Plus, the old Propaganda Department and the old Ministry of Culture have long been leading against the party and socialism, creating all kinds of "reasons" to oppose the revolution and sabotage the reform, making people even more reluctant to face difficulties. There is also a small group of people who are malicious. They sabotage the revolution and oppose the reform. The reform of Peking opera, ballet, and symphonic music is how it broke through countless difficulties and obstacles to be carried out.

Comrade Jiang Qing pointed out that since May of this year, the proletarian cultural revolution has entered a nationwide stage that almost involves the entire ideological realm. When talking about the issue of sending work teams, she said that in the proletarian cultural revolution, the form of sending work teams is wrong, and their work content is particularly wrong! They did not direct the spearhead of the struggle at the small group of capitalists within the party and the reactionary academic authorities, but at the revolutionary students. The direction of the spearhead of the struggle is a major issue of principle, a matter of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought! Our Chairman Mao proposed as early as June this year not to hastily send work teams, but some comrades did not report to Chairman Mao and hastily sent them out. But it should be pointed out that the problem is not in the form of the work teams, but in their policies and guidelines. Some units did not send work teams and relied on the original leadership to work, and they also made mistakes. There was also a part of the work teams that adopted correct policies and guidelines and did not make mistakes. This can explain where the problem is.

Comrade Jiang Qing said that on August 18, Chairman Mao received a hundred thousand revolutionary young people, and the Chairman was so respectful of the masses' pioneering spirit, so trusting of the masses, and so caring for the masses. I feel that I have learned very little. After that, the Red Guards went out into society and smashed the Four Olds. We in the Central Cultural Revolution Group clapped our hands in joy. But after a few days, we encountered new problems, so we quickly found materials and conducted investigations, and only then did we catch up with the rapidly developing revolutionary situation. I call it following one end tightly, which is Mao Zedong Thought; following the other end tightly, which is the brave spirit and revolutionary rebellious spirit of the young revolutionaries.

Comrade Jiang Qing emphasized the issue of the cultural revolution in the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe. She said that the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe is a unit in Beijing that first accepted the glorious task of Peking opera reform. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, in just a few years, you have indeed made achievements in the creation of revolutionary modern plays and set an example for the reform of Peking opera across the country.

She pointed out that for the National Day performances of revolutionary modern plays, we had many discussions, supported your performances, and opposed the erroneous views that attempted to erase your revolutionary achievements. For the performance of your "Shajiabang," and for the performances of "The Red Lantern," "The Capture of the Tiger Mountain," "The Harbor," "The Ambush of the White Tiger Regiment," the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," "The White-Haired Girl," the symphonic music "Shajiabang," and so on, we did some work for various aspects. We explained to them: these creations are great victories of the proletarian cultural revolution, great victories of Chairman Mao's artistic thought of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The facts have proven: the broad masses acknowledge our achievements. Revolutionaries and revolutionary peoples around the world give us good evaluations. Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Chen Boda, Comrade Kang Sheng, and many other comrades have affirmed our achievements and given us great support and encouragement!

She said, I hope that after the struggle and tempering of this proletarian cultural revolution, we will continue to combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In this way, we will definitely be able to make new achievements in the reform of Peking opera and other literary arts! Our task is arduous. But we must bravely shoulder this glorious and arduous revolutionary task.

Comrade Jiang Qing said that the proletarian cultural revolution in the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe exists with very sharp and complex class struggles, with struggles for power between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. You have not truly deeply and widely exposed and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Beijing Municipal Committee. Here, it must be seriously pointed out: some responsible comrades in the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe have not seriously drawn a clear line with the old Beijing Municipal Committee, have not deeply exposed the crimes of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, and have not seriously examined their own mistakes. They implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, with a hidden set, an open set, a soft set, and a hard set, resisting Chairman Mao's instructions, sabotaging the reform of Peking opera, with two-faced and three-sided tricks, playing many vile tricks, striking you and also striking us. The old Beijing Municipal Committee, the old Propaganda Department, and the old Ministry of Culture colluded with each other, committing heinous crimes against the party and the people, which must be thoroughly exposed and settled. Regarding the bourgeois reactionary line within our party that targets opposing the proletarian revolutionary line led by Chairman Mao, it must also be thoroughly exposed and criticized. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee the victory of the revolution. Some responsible comrades in the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe must thoroughly confess and thoroughly expose. There is only this path; there is no other way out! After thorough criticism by the masses, if they truly thoroughly confess and expose, "change their face and wash their heart, and become new people," they can still participate in the revolution. If they truly strive to reform and return to the correct path of the party, they may still have the opportunity to become good cadres.

She pointed out that due to not thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, the old Propaganda Department, and the old Ministry of Culture, and not eliminating the influence of this counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the troupe, your proletarian cultural revolution cannot be carried out thoroughly, and your troupe's movement may go astray and be usurped by a few malicious individuals. This will have a very unfavorable impact on the future construction of the troupe.

She pointed out that within your troupe, not all cadres, party members, and league members have made mistakes, and not all cadres have made the same kind of mistakes, but they must be treated differently, facts must be presented, reasons must be explained, and the attitude of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the disease to save the person" must be adopted, allowing the correction of mistakes and allowing revolution.

She emphasized that in the proletarian cultural revolution, we must use cultural struggle, not physical struggle. Do not hit people. Physical struggle can only affect the skin and flesh, while cultural struggle can affect the soul.

She suggested that you: firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, grasp the correct policies and guidelines formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, oppose the small group of capitalists within the party, gradually strengthen the leftist forces in the struggle, unite the majority, including those who have been deceived, and help them return to the correct path.

When talking about the issue of "minority" and "majority," she said that we cannot talk about "minority" and "majority" without class standpoint, but we must see whose hands hold the truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, who truly stands on the revolutionary standpoint of the proletariat, and who truly implements Chairman Mao's correct line. Different units must be analyzed concretely.

Comrade Jiang Qing finally said, I hope that all comrades in the troupe can hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, firmly implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, unite on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform, and build the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe into a truly proletarianized and militarized revolutionary model troupe!

Comrade Jiang Qing's speech was repeatedly interrupted by the enthusiastic applause and cheers of all the attendees.

Comrade Xie Bangzhong, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, spoke at the meeting. He said that according to the instructions of the Central Military Commission and the decision of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe (including the Red Guard performance team of the Beijing Drama Academy participating in the National Day performance), the Beijing Peking Opera Theater (including the Red Guard performance team of the China Opera Academy participating in the National Day performance), the Central Orchestra, and the ballet troupe and orchestra of the Central Opera and Dance Theater were incorporated into the organizational structure of the People's Liberation Army and listed in the military sequence, becoming a part of the political and cultural work of our army.

Comrade Xie Bangzhong, on behalf of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, all military personnel, and all cultural workers in the army, extended a warm welcome to the comrades in these arts troupes.

Comrade Xie Bangzhong also announced to everyone that the Central Military Commission decided that Comrade Jiang Qing would serve as a cultural advisor to the People's Liberation Army. He said that this is the great concern of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao for the cultural work of our army. Comrade Jiang Qing has a good understanding of Mao Zedong Thought, a deep understanding, and a firm and active application. Her serving as a cultural advisor to our army is an important decision to strengthen the revolutionary and militarized nature of the army's cultural work.

Comrade Xie Bangzhong finally required all cultural workers in the army to seriously study Comrade Jiang Qing's speech, firmly implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and follow the instructions of the Central Military Commission and the General Political Department to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

Comrade Wu De, the second secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, spoke at the meeting. He said that the arts circle in Beijing has been severely poisoned by the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Beijing Municipal Committee. The revisionist elements of the old Beijing Municipal Committee directly instructed some units' capitalists to adopt extremely despicable means to resist Chairman Mao's instructions and sabotage Comrade Jiang Qing's work in theatrical reform. This evil activity fully proves that the class struggle in the arts circle is very sharp and complex. We are determined to stand with you, rely on the broad revolutionary masses, and thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, overthrow and denounce the counter-revolutionary revisionists, thoroughly eliminate their evil influence, and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's artistic line, carrying the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

Comrades Tan Yuanshou, Yu Leidi, Li Xinghai, He Fuxing, Qian Haoliang, and others from the arts troupes incorporated into the organizational structure of the People's Liberation Army, such as the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, spoke at the meeting one after another. They unanimously expressed their support for the instructions of the Central Military Commission and the decision of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and their support for the speeches of Comrades Chen Boda and Jiang Qing. They also felt honored and excited to be able to join the glorious ranks of the People's Liberation Army.

They said that Comrade Jiang Qing, representing the correct line of our great leader Chairman Mao, has been unyieldingly fighting against the counter-revolutionary revisionists in the arts circle, leading us to carry out the great revolution in Peking opera, ballet, symphonic music, and other arts, making these arts serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, becoming a powerful tool for serving proletarian politics, and a powerful tool for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

They expressed that they would definitely firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, the old Propaganda Department, and the old Ministry of Culture, and resolutely complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform, carrying the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

Li Yan, a representative of the August First Film Studio, also spoke at the meeting. He said: Comrade Jiang Qing cares deeply about the film industry. To make the film "South Sea Fortress" well, she reviewed the film script many times, talked to the scriptwriters, directors, and actors many times, and reviewed the sample films many times. However, due to a small group of capitalists within the party in our studio resisting Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions, the filming of "South Sea Fortress" and the revision of the script were greatly obstructed.

He said: Through this proletarian cultural revolution, we will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of the Central Military Commission, the General Political Department, and Comrade Jiang Qing, make this film that propagates Chairman Mao's people's war thought well, and build our studio into a stronghold for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

The speakers expressed that we will definitely follow Comrade Lin Biao's teachings, "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." We will insist on the four firsts, carry forward the three-eighths spirit, and take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as our lifelong motto. We will break with selfishness and establish public spirit, seriously reform our worldview, and undergo a thorough transformation and tempering in the red furnace of the People's Liberation Army. We will turn our troupes, orchestras, and film studios into propaganda teams for Mao Zedong Thought, perform more revolutionary modern plays that reflect the great Mao Zedong Thought, create new proletarian arts, and better serve the Chinese people and the people of the world.

Comrade Zhou Enlai spoke in the midst of thunderous applause.

Comrade Zhou Enlai first expressed his complete agreement and support for Comrade Jiang Qing's speech and warmly congratulated the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe and the other four arts troupes on joining the organizational structure of the People's Liberation Army. He also said: I hope that in the future, more arts units will join the sequence of the People's Liberation Army.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said that the proletarian cultural revolution currently being carried out in our country is a very broad and profound, higher-stage proletarian revolutionary movement. This revolution has great significance. This revolution has mobilized hundreds of millions of people, touching the soul of every individual. This revolution has shocked the world, shocked the entire society, and shocked the entire arts circle. This revolution, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, uses a proletarian worldview to transform society. The purpose of this great revolution is to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, uproot the roots of revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, ensure that our country will never change color, greatly promote the development of social productive forces, and greatly influence and support the revolutionary movements of the people of the world.

He said that the proletarian cultural revolution is a new stage of the socialist revolution. With the proletariat taking the stage of history, a new people's literature and art that opposes the old exploitative class literature and art has emerged. In the period of the new democratic revolution, Chairman Mao proposed the historical task of the cultural revolution. Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" expounded the guiding principles of the proletarian cultural revolution. In the period of the socialist revolution, Chairman Mao personally led a series of major movements to criticize bourgeois academic thought. After basically completing the socialist revolution on the economic front, he launched a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Chairman Mao published the two brilliant works "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China," proposing the great historical task of eliminating bourgeois ideology and promoting proletarian ideology in the ideological realm. This revolution has developed to the current stage, becoming a great proletarian cultural revolution movement that involves the entire society, is participated in consciously by hundreds of millions of people, and is carried out vigorously.

Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out that our artistic revolution has achieved great victories. In recent years, the reforms of Peking opera, ballet, symphonic music, and sculpture have all achieved epoch-making achievements. This is a great leap forward in the revolutionary nature of artistic work. These achievements were made under the guidance of Chairman Mao's direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the policies of valuing the present over the past, using the past for the present, and using foreign for Chinese. These are the results of overcoming the numerous obstacles of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the old Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, and the old Beijing Municipal Committee through serious class struggles. This is the elevation on the basis of popularization and the popularization under the guidance of elevation. Under the influence and promotion of these models, a batch of new revolutionary literary and artistic works has been produced, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have taken to the stage. This revolutionary movement will definitely be further carried out in various artistic fields, and it will have a very far-reaching impact on our future.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said that the artistic achievements mentioned above are inseparable from the guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, and they are inseparable from the support and cooperation of the revolutionary leftists in the arts circle. This is the result of a resolute struggle against the line of revisionism that has run through the arts circle from the 1930s to the 1960s. Comrade Jiang Qing personally participated in the struggle and artistic practice.

He said that our artistic revolution achievements have not only been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary masses at home but have also been highly evaluated and enthusiastically praised by revolutionary comrades and friends around the world.

Comrade Zhou Enlai listed many foreign comrades and friends' praise for our artistic reform and said that from the reflections of many foreign comrades and friends, we can see how highly the revolutionary peoples of the world value our artistic reform achievements! This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! Chairman Mao's artistic direction is the direction of revolutionary arts around the world. The path we are opening up is the path that the proletarian arts of the world will take! We should have full confidence to continue to advance on this correct path!

He said that our arts troupes are one of the key units in the proletarian cultural revolution. In the past, they were long under the control of a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, making the arts circle an important stronghold for them to resist Chairman Mao's artistic thoughts and revolutionary line, spread revisionist poison, and create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. We must definitely, in the proletarian cultural revolution, resolutely expose all the anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought bourgeois rightists who have been entrenched in the arts circle, and overthrow, denounce, and overthrow them.

He pointed out that in the proletarian cultural revolution, we must thoroughly rectify and build our arts troops. In the fiery revolutionary struggle, promote the revolutionary nature of the thoughts of the arts workers, eliminate the evil influence of the revisionist artistic line, firmly implement Chairman Mao's artistic line, and seriously combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, making our arts troops into proletarianized and militarized revolutionary arts troops. All comrades who do artistic work must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, seriously reform their worldview, and test themselves in the fiery class struggle, not to be a "verbal revolutionary" who only talks but does not act, but to strive to be a true proletarian arts warrior who is consistent in words and deeds.

He emphasized that the proletarian cultural revolution in the arts circle must be solved by the arts workers themselves. We must definitely implement Chairman Mao's correct line, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform on the artistic front deeply, thoroughly, and completely.

Comrade Zhou Enlai finally said that we will definitely replace all the decadent arts of the exploiting classes with proletarian new arts! Under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely create the most brilliant arts in human history.

At the end of the meeting, everyone stood up and, under the direction of Comrade Zhou Enlai, sang "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" in unison. The revolutionary spirit-filled song and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao" echoed throughout the hall, lingering on.

Leaders from the Central Committee and other departments, including Tao Zhu, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Xu Xiangqian, Ye Jianying, Xie Fuzhi, Deng Yingchao, Xiao Hua, Liu Zhiqian, Zhang Chunqiao, Wu De, Guo Moruo, Xie Bangzhong, Wang Li, Guan Feng, Chen Boda, Mu Xin, Yao Wenyuan, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Xu Licheng, Yuan Ziqin, Zhang Chuming, Wang Dongxing, Zhou Rongxin, Tong Xiaoping, Hu Chi, Ding Guoyu, Xu Guangping, Zhang Ben, Li Wei, Chen Yading, Yu Jie, Cao Yiyou, Ye Qun, Zhang Qie, and others, attended the meeting.

Attendees also included Song Qun, Jin Jingmai, Li Yingru, Qu Xihuan, Li Yan, Wu Di, Yu Ligeng, Ye Xiangzhen, Tan Yuanshou, Wang Mengyun, Qian Haoliang, Du Jinfang, Li Xinghai, Deng Yuanfeng, Yu Leidi, He Fuxing, and others.

Additionally, 182 Red Guards stood on the stage.

    全国革命文艺大军沿着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进
    首都举行文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会
    周恩来、陈伯达、江青三位同志作了重要讲话。中央和各方面负责人以及首都和各地两万多革命文艺战士出席了大会。会议号召全国革命文艺战士高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚决贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，在马列主义、毛泽东思想的原则基础上团结起来，完成一斗二批三改的任务，努力创造人类历史上最光辉灿烂的无产阶级新文艺。中央军委决定江青同志任解放军文化工作顾问，北京京剧一团等四文艺团体列入解放军建制
    新华社三日讯　在我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席连续八次接见一千一百多万文化革命大军之后，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得伟大胜利的大好形势下，首都和来自全国各地的两万多名革命文艺战士，十一月二十八日晚上在雄伟壮丽的人民大会堂举行了文艺界无产阶级文化大革命大会。
    中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理周恩来同志，中共中央政治局常委、中共中央文化革命小组组长陈伯达同志，中共中央文化革命小组第一副组长、中国人民解放军文化工作顾问江青同志等，出席了大会，作了重要讲话。
    这次大会，是我国革命文艺大军向文艺界一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和他们所代表的反革命修正主义文艺路线发动总攻击的誓师大会。这次大会，必将有力地推动文艺界无产阶级文化大革命运动轰轰烈烈地向前发展，必将引导全国革命文艺大军沿着毛主席所指引的方向胜利前进。
    陈伯达同志致开幕词
    陈伯达同志主持了大会，他在开幕词中说：
    今天的会议，是一个有重要意义的会议。历史上的文化革命，常常是从文艺方面开头的。我们现在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，也正是这样。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，以毛泽东思想为指南。毛泽东同志创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的文艺理论，用无产阶级宇宙观，系统地、彻底地解决了我们文艺战线上的问题，同时，系统地、彻底地给我们开辟了无产阶级文化革命的一条完全崭新的道路。
    一九六二年，在党的八届十中全会上，毛主席提出了要抓意识形态领域里的阶级斗争。在毛主席的这一伟大号召下，在毛泽东思想的直接指导下，掀起了京剧改革，芭蕾舞剧改革，交响音乐改革等古为今用，洋为中用，推陈出新的革命改革的高潮，用京剧等形式，表达中国无产阶级领导下的群众英勇斗争的史诗。这个新的创造，给京剧、芭蕾舞剧、交响音乐等以新的生命，不但内容是全新的，而且在形式上也有很大的革新，面貌改变了。革命的现代剧，到处出现在我们的舞台上。这种无产阶级新文艺空前地吸引了广大群众。但是，反动派，反革命修正主义分子，他们却咒骂它，恨死它。不为别的，就是因为这种新文艺的作用，将大大加强我国人民群众的政治觉悟，将大大加强我国的无产阶级专政和社会主义制度。
    我在这里想说，坚持这种文艺革命的方针，而同反动派、反革命修正主义分子进行不屈不挠的斗争的同志中，江青同志是有特殊的贡献的。
    历史打破了反动派、反革命修正主义分子的迷梦。党的八届十中全会以来的文艺革命，成为我国无产阶级文化大革命的真正的开端。
    文艺史上充满着剧烈的冲突。新和旧的冲突，现代和古代的冲突，这些都是反映社会阶级斗争的冲突。处在革命时期的资产阶级，用当时的新文艺，作为摧毁封建制度的一种重要武器。现在无产阶级，同样必须用自己为工农兵服务的新文艺，作为摧毁资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的武器。无产阶级在夺取政权之后，资产阶级并不甘心退出历史舞台。毛主席经常给我们指出：被推翻了的资产阶级采用各种方法，企图利用文艺阵地，作为腐蚀群众、准备资本主义复辟的温床。因此，我们在文艺上的任务，不是减轻了，而是加重了。我们在文艺战线上的领导，不是应该削弱，而是相反地，应该更加强。我们的革命文艺团体，要实行自己的光荣任务，必须把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    在阶级还存在的时候，否认文艺上的冲突，是完全错误的。在将来共产主义社会，阶级消灭了，阶级矛盾、阶级斗争不存在了，但仍然会有新和旧的冲突，会有我们现在还不能完全预见或者不可能预见到的冲突，那些冲突，当然也会反映到文艺上来。
    我现在就说这些，作为这次在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中举行的文艺大会的开幕词。
    江青同志讲话
    江青同志在全场雷鸣般的掌声中讲话。她首先向文艺界的同志们，朋友们，和红卫兵小将们问好，并致无产阶级的革命敬礼。
    江青同志在叙述她对无产阶级文化大革命的认识过程时说，几年前，我较比系统地接触了一部分文学艺术。首先我感觉到，为什么在社会主义中国的舞台上，又有鬼戏呢？然后，我感到很惊异，京剧反映现实是不太敏感的，但是，出现了《海瑞罢官》《李慧娘》……等这样严重的反动政治倾向的戏，还有美其名曰
  “挖掘传统”，搞了很多帝王将相、才子佳人的东西。在整个文艺界，大谈大演“名”、“洋”、“古”，充满了厚古薄今，崇洋非中，厚死薄生的一片恶浊的空气。我开始感觉到，我们的文学艺术不能适应社会主义的经济基础，那它就必然要破坏社会主义的经济基础。
    江青同志说，多少年以来，随着社会政治经济方面新旧斗争的变化，在文学艺术方面，也出现了新的文学艺术，以与旧的文学艺术相对抗。就是号称最难改革的京剧，也出现了新的作品。大家知道，在三十多年前，鲁迅曾经是领导文化革命的伟大旗手。毛主席则在二十多年前，提出了文艺为工农兵服务的方向，提出了推陈出新的问题。
    她说，推陈出新，就是要有新的、人民大众的内容，人民喜闻乐见的民族形式。内容有许多是不能推陈出新的，如鬼神，宗教，我们怎么能批判地继承呢？我认为不能。因为我们是无神论者，我们是共产党员，根本不相信世界上有什么鬼神上帝。又例如地主阶级的封建道德，资产阶级道德，它们天经地义的道德，是要压迫人、剥削人的，难道我们能批判地继承压迫人、剥削人的东西吗？我认为不能。因为我们是一个无产阶级专政的国家，我们是要建设社会主义，我们的经济基础是公有制度，坚决反对那些压迫人、剥削人的私有制度。我们无产阶级文化大革命的一个重要方面，就是扫荡一切剥削制度的残余，扫荡一切剥削阶级的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯。她接着说，对于旧的艺术形式，不能采取虚无主义的态度，也不能采取全盘肯定的态度。一个民族，总有它的艺术形式，艺术特色。我们如果不把祖国最美好的艺术形式、艺术特色加以批判地继承，采取虚无主义的态度，那是错误的。相反，全盘肯定，不作任何推陈出新，也是错误的。对于全世界各族人民的优秀艺术形式，我们也要按毛主席的“洋为中用”的指示，来做推陈出新的工作。
      江青同志指出，帝国主义是垂死的、寄生的、腐朽的资本主义。现代修正主义是帝国主义政策的产物，是资本主义的变种。他们什么好作品都搞不出来了。资本主义已经有几百年了，他们的所谓“经典”作品，也不过那么一点。他们有一些是模仿所谓的“经典”作品，死板了，不能吸引人了，因此完全衰落了；另一些则是大量泛滥，毒害麻痹人民的阿飞舞，爵士乐，脱衣舞，印象派，象征派，抽象派，野兽派，现代派，……等等，名堂多了。一句话：腐朽下流，毒害和麻痹人民。
    她说，试问：旧的文学艺术不能适应社会主义的经济基础，古典的艺术形式不能完全适应社会主义的思想内容，那要不要革命？（群众高呼：要！）要不要改革？（群众高呼：要！）我相信，大多数同志们和朋友们，会认为需要革命的，需要改革的，只是这是一场严重的阶级斗争，又是一件非常细致、相当困难的工作。再加上过去旧中宣部、旧文化部长期的反党反社会主义的领导，制造了种种“理由”，反对革命，破坏改革，就更加深了一般人的畏难情绪。还有一小撮人，则是别有用心的。他们破坏革命，反对改革。京剧的改革，芭蕾舞剧的改革，交响音乐的改革，就是这样冲破重重困难和阻挠搞起来的。
    江青同志指出，在今年五月以后，进入了全国性的几乎涉及整个意识形态领域的无产阶级文化大革命。她在谈到派工作队的问题时说，在无产阶级文化大革命中，派工作队这个形式是错误的，他们的工作内容尤其是错误的！他们不是把斗争锋芒对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，以及反动的学术权威，而是对准革命的学生。斗争的锋芒对准什么，这是一个大是大非的问题，这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的原则问题！我们的毛主席早在今年六月间，就提出过不要急急忙忙派工作队的问题，可是有的同志没有请示毛主席，就急急忙忙地派出去了。但要指出，问题不在工作队的形式，而在它的方针、政策。有些单位并没有派工作队，依靠原来的领导人进行工作，也同样犯了错误。也有一部分工作队采取了正确的方针、政策，并没有犯错误的。这就可以说明，问题究竟在那里。
    江青同志说，八月十八日，毛主席接见了百万革命小将，主席是那样尊重群众的首创精神，是那样相信群众，是那样爱护群众，我觉得自己学习很不够。这以后，红卫兵小将们走向社会，大破四旧，我们中央文化革命小组的同志们拍手称快。但是过了些天，又遇到了新的问题，于是我们赶快找材料，调查研究，这才又追上不断发展的革命形势。我就叫做紧跟一头，那就是毛泽东思想；紧追另一头，那就是革命小将的勇敢精神，革命造反精神。
    江青同志着重地讲了北京京剧一团的文化大革命的问题。她说，北京京剧一团是北京首先接受这次京剧改革光荣任务的一个单位。在毛泽东思想指引下，短短的几年内，你们在创造革命现代戏的工作中，确实做出了成绩，为全国的京剧改革树立了一个样板。
    她指出，为了国庆节演出革命现代戏，我们做过多次讨论，支持了你们演出，反对了那种企图抹杀你们革命成绩的错误观点。为了你们的《沙家浜》能够上演，也是为了《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《奇袭白虎团》，舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，交响音乐《沙家浜》……等等的演出，我们对各方面都做了一些工作。向他们说明：这些创作是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛主席为工农兵服务的文艺思想的伟大胜利。事实证明：广大的人民是承认我们的成绩的。世界上革命的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民是给予我们以好的评价的。毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，恩来同志，伯达同志，康生同志，以及其他许多同志，都肯定了我们的成绩，给过我们巨大的支持和鼓舞！
      她说，我希望：经过这次无产阶级文化大革命的斗争和锻炼，我们还要经常和工农兵相结合。这样，我们一定能够为京剧改革和其他文学艺术的改革做出新的成绩！我们的任务是艰巨的。但我们一定要勇敢地担负起这一光荣而又艰巨的革命任务来。
      江青同志说，北京京剧一团的无产阶级文化大革命，存在着十分尖锐、十分复杂的阶级斗争，存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的夺权斗争。对旧北京市委的反革命修正主义路线，你们还没有真正地进行深入、广泛的揭发和批判。在这里要严肃地指出：北京京剧一团的某些负责人，还没有认真地同旧北京市委划清界限，没有深入揭发旧北京市委的罪行，也没有对自己的错误进行认真的检讨。他们贯彻执行了旧北京市委的反革命修正主义路线，阴一套，阳一套，软一套，硬一套，抗拒毛主席的指示，破坏京剧改革，两面三刀，进行了种种阻挠破坏活动，玩弄了许多恶劣的手段，打击你们，也打击我们。旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部互相勾结，对党，对人民犯下的滔天罪行，必须彻底揭发，彻底清算。对于我们党内以反对毛主席为首的党中央的无产阶级革命路线为目标的资产阶级反动路线，也必须彻底揭发，彻底批判。否则，就不能保障革命的胜利果实。北京京剧一团的某些负责人必须彻底交代，彻底揭发，只有这一条路，除此以外，没有别的出路！经过群众的充分批判，如果他们真正进行了彻底的揭发和交代，“革面洗心，重新做人”，他们还是可以参加革命的。如果他们真正努力改过自新，走上党的正确道路上来，他们还有可能争取做好的干部。
    她指出，由于没有彻底批判旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部的反革命修正主义路线，没有肃清这条反革命修正主义路线在剧团的影响，你们的无产阶级文化大革命就不可能搞彻底，你们剧团的运动就有可能走向邪路，被个别别有用心的人篡夺了领导权。这对将来剧团的建设将会发生很不利的影响。
    她指出，你们剧团内，并不是所有干部、党员、团员都犯了错误，也不是所有干部都犯同样性质的错误，而是必须区别对待，摆事实，讲道理，采取“惩前毖后，治病救人”的态度，允许改正错误，允许革命。
    她强调说，在无产阶级文化大革命中，要用文斗，不用武斗。不要动手打人。武斗只能触及皮肉，文斗才能触及灵魂。
    她指出，我建议你们：牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，掌握党中央、毛主席制定的正确方针和政策，反对一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在斗争中逐步壮大左派队伍，团结大多数，包括那些受蒙蔽的人，帮助他们走上正确的道路。
    她在谈到“少数”和“多数”的问题时说，不能离开阶级观点去谈什么“少数”“多数”，要看马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的真理掌握在谁的手里，谁真正站在无产阶级的革命立场上，谁真正执行了毛主席的正确路线。对不同的单位，要作不同的具体分析。
    江青同志最后说，我希望：全团同志能够更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚决贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的原则基础上团结起来，完成一斗二批三改的任务，把北京京剧一团建设成一个真正的无产阶级化的战斗化的革命样板团！
    江青同志的讲话，不断地受到全体到会同志的热烈鼓掌和欢呼。
      谢镗忠同志发言
    中国人民解放军总政治部文化部部长谢镗忠同志在会上发言。他说，根据中共中央军委的指示，中共中央文化革命小组的决定，将北京市京剧一团（包括北京戏剧专科学校参加国庆演出的红卫兵演出队）、中国京剧院（包括中国戏曲学校参加国庆演出的红卫兵演出队）、中央乐团、中央歌剧舞剧院的芭蕾舞剧团及其乐队，划归中国人民解放军建制，列入部队序列，成为我军进行政治工作和文艺工作的组成部分。
    谢镗忠同志代表中国人民解放军总政治部、全军指战员及部队全体文艺工作者，向这些文艺团体的同志们表示热烈欢迎。
    谢镗忠同志还向大家宣布：中共中央军委决定江青同志担任中国人民解放军文化工作顾问。他说，这是我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席对我军文化工作的极大关怀。江青同志对毛泽东思想学习得很好，领会得很深，运用得很活、很坚决。由她担任我军文化工作顾问，是加强部队文化工作革命化、战斗化的重要决定。
    谢镗忠同志最后要求部队的全体文艺工作者，认真学习江青同志的讲话，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，按照中共中央军委、总政治部的指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
      吴德同志发言
    中共北京市委第二书记吴德同志在会上发言。他说，北京市的文艺界，过去受到了旧北京市委反革命修正主义路线的严重毒害。旧北京市委的修正主义分子们直接指使一些单位的走资本主义道路的当权派，采取极端卑鄙的手段，抗拒毛主席的指示，破坏江青同志进行戏剧改革的工作。这种罪恶活动，充分证明了文艺界的阶级斗争是十分尖锐、十分复杂的。我们决心同你们站在一起，依靠广大革命群众，把揭发批判旧北京市委反革命修正主义路线的斗争搞深搞透，把反革命修正主义分子斗倒斗臭，坚决肃清他们的恶劣影响，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的文艺路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    谭元寿等同志发言
    划归中国人民解放军建制的北京京剧一团等文艺团体的谭元寿、郁蕾娣、李兴海、何复兴、钱浩梁等，先后在会上发言。他们一致表示，热烈拥护中共中央军委的指示和中共中央文化革命小组的决定，热烈拥护陈伯达同志和江青同志的讲话，并为自己能够参加光荣的人民解放军的行列感到欢欣鼓舞。
    他们说，江青同志代表我们伟大领袖毛主席的正确路线，与文艺界的反革命修正主义分子进行了坚持不懈的斗争，领导我们进行了京剧、芭蕾舞剧、交响音乐等艺术的大革命，使这些艺术走上为工农兵服务的道路，成为为无产阶级政治服务的有力工具，成为宣传毛泽东思想的有力工具。
    他们表示，一定要牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，彻底揭发和批判旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部的反革命修正主义路线，坚决完成一斗二批三改的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在会上发言的，还有八一电影制片厂的代表李炎。他说：江青同志对电影事业十分关心。为了拍好电影《南海长城》，她多次审阅电影文学剧本，多次找剧作者、导演、演员谈话，多次审查样片。但是，由于我厂一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，抗拒江青同志的指示，以致《南海长城》这个影片摄制工作以及剧本的修改等，受到了很大阻碍。
    他说：通过这次无产阶级文化大革命，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在中共中央军委、总政治部和江青同志的领导下，把这个宣传毛主席人民战争思想的影片拍好，把我厂建设成一个宣传毛泽东思想的文艺阵地。
    发言的同志表示，我们一定遵照林彪同志的教导，
  “读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”。我们要坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风，把“老三篇”作为我们终身的座右铭，破私立公，认真改造自己的世界观，在中国人民解放军的红色大熔炉中进行脱胎换骨的改造和锻炼。我们一定要把剧团、乐团、电影厂办成毛泽东思想的宣传队，更多地演出反映伟大的毛泽东思想的革命现代戏，创造出崭新的无产阶级新文艺，更好地为中国人民和世界人民服务。
      周恩来同志讲话
    周恩来同志在全场暴风雨般的掌声中讲话。
    周恩来同志首先对江青同志的讲话表示完全同意和支持，并热烈祝贺北京京剧一团等四个文艺团体加入中国人民解放军的建制。他并说：我希望，今后，还会有新的文艺单位加入中国人民解放军的序列。
    周恩来同志说，当前我国正在开展的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场极其广阔的，极其深刻的，更高阶段的无产阶级革命运动。这场革命具有极其伟大的意义。这场革命，发动了亿万群众，触及了每个人的灵魂。这场革命，震动了全世界，震动了整个社会，震动了整个文艺界。这场革命，在毛泽东思想指引下，用无产阶级世界观改造社会。这场大革命的目的，是为了巩固无产阶级专政，挖掉修正主义的根子，防备资本主义的复辟，保证我国永不变色，大大促进社会生产力的发展，并且大大影响和支持全世界人民的革命运动。
    他说，无产阶级文化大革命是社会主义革命的新阶段。随着无产阶级登上历史舞台，就开始出现了同旧的剥削阶级的文学艺术相对抗的新的人民大众的文学艺术。在新民主主义革命时期，毛主席就提出了文化革命的历史任务。毛主席的《新民主主义论》《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，阐明了无产阶级文化革命的指导原则。在社会主义革命时期，毛主席又亲自领导了一系列的重大的反对资产阶级学术思想的批判运动。在经济战线上基本上完成了社会主义革命之后，又展开了政治思想战线上的社会主义革命。毛主席发表了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》这两篇辉煌的著作，提出了在意识形态领域里灭资兴无的伟大历史任务。这个革命发展到现阶段，就成为全社会都动起来的、亿万群众自觉参加的、轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动。
    周恩来同志指出，我们的文艺革命获得了伟大的胜利。近几年来，京剧改革，芭蕾舞剧改革，交响音乐改革，雕塑改革，都取得了划时代的成就。这是文艺工作革命化的大飞跃。这些成就，都是在毛主席的为工农兵服务的方向和厚今薄古、古为今用、洋为中用的方针指导下取得的。这些都是经过严重的阶级斗争，冲破了旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委反革命修正主义路线的重重障碍而取得的。这是在普及的基础上的提高，又是在提高指导下的普及。在这些样板的影响和带动下，已经产生了一批新的革命的文学艺术作品，广大的工农兵登上了戏剧舞台。这个革命运动必将在各个文艺领域里进一步深入地开展起来，必将对我们的未来产生极其深远的影响。
    周恩来同志说，上面所说的文艺革命的成绩都是同江青同志的指导分不开的，都是同文艺界的革命左派的支持和合作分不开的。这是同三十年代到六十年代贯串在文艺界的一条修正主义黑线进行坚决斗争的结果。江青同志亲自参加了斗争实践和艺术实践。
    他说，我们文艺革命的成果，不但受到国内广大工农兵和革命群众的热烈欢迎，而且得到全世界革命的同志和朋友们的高度评价和热情的赞扬。
    周恩来同志列举了许多外国同志和朋友对我国文艺改革的赞语以后说，从许多外国同志和朋友的反映中，我们可以看见，全世界革命人民是多么高度估价我们文艺改革的成就！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！毛主席的文艺方向，就是全世界革命文艺的方向。我们正在开辟的道路，是全世界无产阶级文艺将要走的道路！我们应当有充分的信心，在这条正确的道路上继续前进！
    他说，我们的文艺团体，是无产阶级文化大革命的重点单位之一。过去长期在一小撮反革命修正主义分子的统治下，文艺界成为他们抗拒毛主席文艺思想和革命路线，散布修正主义毒素，制造资本主义复辟舆论的一个重要地盘。我们一定要在无产阶级文化大革命中，坚决把一小撮盘踞在文艺界的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级右派分子，统统揭露出来，把他们斗倒，斗臭，斗垮。
    他指出，在无产阶级文化大革命中，必须彻底整顿和建设我们的文艺队伍。在火热的革命斗争中，促使文艺工作者思想革命化，肃清修正主义文艺路线的恶劣影响，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的文艺路线，认真地同工农兵相结合，使我们的文艺大军成为无产阶级化战斗化的革命文艺队伍。所有做文艺工作的同志，都要在斗争中努力活学活用毛主席的著作，认真改造自己的世界观，在火热的阶级斗争中考验自己，不做那种只在口头上讲讲的“口头革命家”，要努力做一个真正言行一致的无产阶级文艺战士。
    他强调指出，文艺界的无产阶级文化大革命，要靠文艺工作者自己动手来解决。我们一定要坚决执行毛主席的正确路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把文艺战线上的斗、批、改，搞深、搞透、搞彻底。
    周恩来同志最后说，我们一定能够用无产阶级的新文艺来代替一切剥削阶级的腐朽的文艺！在毛泽东思想的照耀下，我们一定能够创造出人类历史上最光辉灿烂的文艺。
    大会结束时，全场起立，在周恩来同志的指挥下，全体同志高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。充满革命豪情的歌声和“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声，激荡着整个大厅，经久不息。
