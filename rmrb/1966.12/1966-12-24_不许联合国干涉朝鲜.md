The United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States, passed a so-called "resolution" on the Korean issue. This "resolution" openly supports the continued occupation of South Korea by U.S. aggression forces and demands that the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" continue to act as a tool to obstruct Korean reunification. This is a brazen provocation against the Korean people and a despicable act of serving U.S. imperialism's continued aggression against Korea.

The United Nations is a tool of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea and a direct participant in the U.S.-led Korean War. It has no right to discuss the "Korean issue." All its "resolutions" on the Korean issue are illegal and invalid. The Korean people will never acknowledge them, nor will the people and countries around the world who love peace. The so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" is an illegal institution set up by U.S. imperialism to interfere in Korea's internal affairs and to invade Korea. It must be dissolved.

Today, the 3,000-li land of Korea is divided. The southern part of Korea is still under the iron hoofs of U.S. aggression forces, and the people of South Korea are living in misery. U.S. imperialism is the culprit behind all the misfortunes and sufferings of the Korean people and is the sworn enemy of the Korean people. The so-called Korean issue is entirely the result of U.S. imperialism's actions. Therefore, to resolve the Korean issue, the primary condition is that U.S. aggression forces must withdraw unconditionally and completely from South Korea.

U.S. imperialism has once again manipulated the UN General Assembly to pass a ridiculous resolution on the Korean issue, which is also to meet its need to further expand the war of aggression in Vietnam. The U.S. has suffered heavy losses in its war of aggression in Vietnam and is desperately short of troops, urgently needing its lackeys to supply cannon fodder. The puppet regime in South Korea has already provided tens of thousands of mercenaries for its master. The U.S. uses the UN General Assembly to pass the resolution on the Korean issue to legalize its occupation of South Korea, so as to drive more South Korean mercenaries into the Vietnam battlefield.

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, in the UN's illegal discussion of the Korean issue, did not dare to severely condemn the U.S.'s heinous crimes of aggression against Korea, did not dare to expose the various plots of the U.S.'s long-term occupation of South Korea, and did not dare to touch upon the essence of the UN being a tool of U.S. aggression against Korea. This once again proves that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is trying to bring the Korean issue into the track of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world. Empty and beautiful words cannot cover up the Soviet revisionist leadership clique's treacherous stance of fake support and real betrayal towards the Korean people's anti-U.S. struggle and the cause of reunifying the motherland.

Chairman Mao said: "Oppressed peoples and oppressed nations can never entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle."

The Chinese people have always firmly supported the Korean people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression and for the reunification of their motherland. The Chinese people have always believed that the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. The Chinese people firmly believe that the Korean people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle will surely break through all obstacles and achieve final victory; the U.S. aggressors will definitely be driven out of Korean territory; and the beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea will definitely be reunified.

    不许联合国干涉朝鲜
    本报评论员
    联合国大会在美国操纵下，通过了一项所谓朝鲜问题的“决议”。这个“决议”公然支持美国侵略军继续霸占南朝鲜，并要“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”继续充当阻挠朝鲜统一的工具。这是对朝鲜人民的狂妄挑衅，是为美帝国主义继续侵略朝鲜效劳的一个恶劣行径。
    联合国是美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的一个工具，是直接参与美国侵朝战争的交战一方。它根本没有资格讨论什么“朝鲜问题”。它所作的关于朝鲜问题的一切“决议”都是非法的，无效的。朝鲜人民绝不承认，世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民，也绝不承认。所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”，是美帝国主义干涉朝鲜内政和侵略朝鲜的一个非法的机构，必须把它解散。
    今天，朝鲜三千里江山遭到分裂。朝鲜南部仍然处于美国侵略军的铁蹄之下，南朝鲜人民生活在水深火热之中。美帝国主义是朝鲜人民所遭受的一切不幸和痛苦的罪魁，是朝鲜人民的不共戴天的敌人。所谓朝鲜问题，完全是美帝国主义一手造成的。因此，要解决朝鲜问题，首要条件是美国侵略军必须无条件地，一个也不留地从南朝鲜滚出去。
    美帝国主义又一次操纵联大通过关于朝鲜问题的荒谬决议，也是为了适应它进一步扩大侵越战争的需要。美国在侵略越南的战争中，损失惨重，兵员奇缺，迫切需要它的仆从源源供应炮灰。南朝鲜傀儡集团已经为它的主子拿出几万帮凶军。美国利用联大通过朝鲜问题的决议，也就是要使它霸占南朝鲜的地位合法化，以便驱使更多的南朝鲜帮凶军投入越南战场。
    苏联修正主义领导集团在联合国非法讨论朝鲜问题的大会上，根本不敢严厉谴责美国侵略朝鲜的滔天罪行，根本不敢揭露美国长期霸占南朝鲜的种种阴谋，根本不敢触及联合国是美国侵略朝鲜工具的实质。这就再一次证明，苏联修正主义领导集团力图把朝鲜问题纳入美苏合作主宰世界的轨道。空洞的漂亮话，掩盖不了苏联修正主义领导集团对朝鲜人民反美斗争和统一祖国的事业所采取的假支持、真出卖的叛卖立场。
    毛主席说：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”
    中国人民一贯坚决支持朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略、要求重新统一祖国的正义斗争。中国人民一贯认为，朝鲜问题应该由朝鲜人民自己解决。中国人民坚信，朝鲜人民反美爱国的斗争，必将冲破重重障碍，取得最后的胜利；美国侵略者一定会被赶出朝鲜国土；朝鲜的锦绣河山一定会得到统一。
