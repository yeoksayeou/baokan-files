According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 30th, Bujumbura reported: On the evening of the 28th, Burundi's Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Mikombe, announced on the Bujumbura radio station that King Ntare V had been overthrown and that the Republic of Burundi had been established, with Mikombe himself as the President of the Republic.

Mikombe accused the monarchical system of being "the root of all our misfortunes" and "unable to guarantee Burundi's progress, unity, and reconstruction."

Mikombe announced on the radio the dissolution of the former Burundi government and the establishment of a provisional national revolutionary committee composed of army officers, with Mikombe as the chairman. Before the formation of a new government, this provisional national revolutionary committee exercises governmental powers.

It was announced that army officers would replace the provincial governors, and the former Minister of Justice, Simbananiye, was appointed as the Prosecutor General.

According to reports, after Mikombe announced the establishment of the republic, there were no incidents within the country. On the 29th, the capital of Burundi, Bujumbura, was very calm, with shops operating as usual and offices functioning normally.

News from Leopoldville stated that after the coup in Burundi and the announcement of the establishment of the republic, the puppet regime leader in the Congo (Leopoldville) backed by the United States, Mobutu, shouted on the Leopoldville radio station on the 29th: "The Burundi coup is an 'impolite gesture' towards the Congo."

    前首相米孔贝罗任总统并成立临时革命委员会
    据新华社三十日讯　布琼布拉消息：布隆迪首相兼国防大臣米孔贝罗二十八日晚在布琼布拉电台宣布，国王恩塔尔五世已被推翻，并成立了布隆迪共和国，由米孔贝罗本人任共和国总统。
    米孔贝罗指责君主政体“是我们一切不幸的根源”，“不能保证布隆迪的进步、统一和重建”。
    米孔贝罗在电台宣布解散原来的布隆迪政府，成立一个由陆军军官组成的临时全国革命委员会，米孔贝罗任这个委员会主席。在成立新政府之前，这个临时全国革命委员会行使政府权力。
    据宣布，任命陆军军官代替各省省长，并任命了前司法大臣辛巴纳尼耶为检察长。
    据报道，在米孔贝罗宣布成立共和国后，国内没有发生事件。二十九日，布隆迪首都布琼布拉很平静，商店照常营业，机关照常办公。
    来自利奥波德维尔的消息说，在布隆迪发生政变宣布成立共和国之后，美国在刚果（利）扶植的傀儡政权头子蒙博托二十九日在利奥波德维尔电台叫嚷：布隆迪政变是对刚果的一种“无礼姿态”。
