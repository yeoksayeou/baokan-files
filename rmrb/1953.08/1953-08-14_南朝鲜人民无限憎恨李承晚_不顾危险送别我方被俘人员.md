Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 12th: When our captured personnel passed through South Korea on their way back, the people of South Korea, living under violent rule, showed their sincere feelings for our captured personnel.

On August 5th, when Yan Zhixie and other captured Korean People's Army personnel repatriated from Prisoner of War Camp No. 1 on Geoje Island passed near Incheon, an old man who was leading an ox working in the fields stopped to raise his hand in farewell.

Lin Changyun, Li Lin Kui and others repatriated from Prisoner of War Camp No. 14 on Geoje Island arrived by train at the first small station before Seoul on the afternoon of August 8th when a farmer in his forties and a fifteen or sixteen-year-old boy waved to them gently, only to be beaten and arrested by the puppet police when they were discovered.

When Jin Yihua and others repatriated from Prisoner of War Camp No. 13 on Geoje Island were on a train stopped at a certain station on August 8th, a young man passed by the carriage and whispered, "Comrades, sing 'The Song of General Kim Il-sung'!" He whistled the tune softly, and our returning personnel sang it in unison. Jin Yihua said: "From the sincere feelings expressed by the folks from all over South Korea towards us, we can see their hatred for Syngman Rhee and their yearning for the Republic. Much of the land in South Korea is barren, but as soon as we passed Panmunjom, we saw that the crops were all green. We felt the feelings of the South Korean people when they risked danger to wave goodbye to us."

    南朝鲜人民无限憎恨李承晚
    不顾危险送别我方被俘人员
    【新华社开城十二日电】我方被俘人员途经南朝鲜归来时，在暴力统治下的南朝鲜人民流露出他们对我方被俘人员的真挚感情。
    八月五日从巨济岛第一号战俘营遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员严智爕等经过仁川附近时，有一个正在牵着牛劳动的老大爷就暂停下来举手送别。
    从巨济岛第十四号战俘营遣返的林昌云、李麟奎等人，在八日下午乘火车到达汉城前面的第一个小站停车时，有一个四十多岁的农民和一个十五、六岁的少年向他们轻轻挥手，因被伪警察发觉，以致遭到殴打并被拘捕起来。
    从巨济岛第十三号战俘营遣返的金义华等，八日乘火车停在某车站时，有一个青年人在经过车厢时轻声说：“同志们，唱一支‘金日成将军之歌’吧！”他用口哨轻轻地吹起这支曲子来，我方归来人员于是齐声唱起来。金义华说：“从南朝鲜各地老乡对我们流露出的真挚感情，可以看出他们对李承晚的憎恨和对共和国的向往。南朝鲜许多土地都荒芜了，但是一过板门店，我们就看到庄稼都是绿油油的。我们体会到南朝鲜人民冒着危险向我们挥手送别时的心情。”
