Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch:

    Although the American propaganda machine is doing its utmost to spread rumors, re-peddling the repeatedly bankrupt lies about the so-called "mistreatment" of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese side, many returned British and American prisoners of war admit that the Korean and Chinese side treated prisoners of war with a humanitarian spirit.

    According to a Reuters report on the 5th: Returned British POW Brand said: "I stayed in two bunker hospitals one after the other, and finally they sent me to the hospital in the POW camp where my companions were. They treated me as well as they could, and I was discharged from the hospital in March of this year. I've been completely fine since then." Brand mentioned that after he was discharged from the hospital, he and other British POWs were in the same POW camp. The British POWs lived together and enjoyed games and entertainment together. They played softball and volleyball, and swam in the Yalu River near the camp.

    Another British POW, cavalryman Karl, described to Reuters reporters the "comfortable POW life" of "only entertainment and no work" he had lived in the POW camp since he was captured in 1951. Karl said: "We often performed plays and had concerts every night. We wrote some plays ourselves and performed them." He said: The POW camp authorities also allowed drinking to celebrate Coronation Day.

    Corporal Elliott of the Gloucester Regiment also said that the Chinese soldiers who captured them treated them very well. He said: "The first Chinese soldiers we saw looked very young and cheerful. They often laughed loudly. Later, the Chinese soldiers took us to Kaesong, and we could buy cigarettes and candy at the local markets along the way when we went north."

    Canadian POW Sergeant Belletier said that he was sent to Pyoktong after being captured. He said: "I went to the hospital there, and a Chinese doctor operated on me. We were treated very well in the hospital." He talked about the farewell party the POW camp gave them: "They prepared chicken, two bottles of beer for every eight people, and one bottle of ordinary wine. Then they gave each of us ten packs of cigarettes for the journey."

    Although the returned American POWs were severely warned and monitored by the US military authorities, they still talked about some facts about the Korean and Chinese side's lenient treatment of POWs. According to Reuters reports: US Army Sergeant Hollett said that in his two and a half years as a POW, he was treated "not badly at all."

    American news agencies are doing their best to distort, tamper with, and fabricate the POWs' conversations, but in their news, they still cannot avoid revealing some facts that the POWs mentioned. The Associated Press admitted: Colombian POW Palacios said that the Colombian soldiers who were captured spent most of their time playing basketball, table tennis, and playing poker. US Army Private First Class Albert Jikinni said that he was injured in the leg when he was captured and received treatment within four hours. He has now recovered.

### 被遣返的英美战俘称道我方的人道待遇

    被遣返的英美战俘称道我方的人道待遇
    【新华社六日讯】虽然美国宣传机器竭力造谣，重新散布那些早已一再破产的所谓朝中方面“虐待”战俘的谎话，但是，许多被遣返的英、美战俘都承认，朝中方面是以人道主义精神对待战俘的。
    据路透社五日报道：被遣返的英国战俘布兰德说：“我先后住了两个地堡医院，最后终于把我送到同伴们所在的那个战俘营的医院里。他们待我尽量的好，我在今年三月出院。自从那时起我就完全好了。”布兰德谈到，他出了医院后，就和其他英国战俘同在那个战俘营里。英国战俘都住在一起，一同游戏娱乐。他们玩软式棒球和排球，并在营房附近的鸭绿江上游泳。
    另一个英国战俘骑兵卡尔向路透社记者叙述了他自从一九五一年被俘以来在战俘营中所过的“只娱乐不工作”的“舒舒服服的战俘生活”。卡尔说：“我们时常演剧并且每晚都有音乐会。我们自己编了一些剧并把它们上演。”他说：战俘营当局还允许吃酒庆祝加冕节。
    格罗斯特团中的埃利奥特下士也说，俘获他们的中国兵待他们很好。他说：“最初见到的那些中国兵看上去非常年青、愉快。他们常常纵声大笑。后来中国兵带我们到开城去，我们到北面去时，一路上可以在当地市场上买香烟和糖果。”
    加拿大战俘中士贝勒蒂尔说，他在被俘后被送到碧潼。他说：“我到了那里的医院里，由一位中国医生给我动手术，我们在医院里受的待遇很好。”他谈到战俘营为他们饯行的情形说：“他们预备了小鸡，每八个人两瓶啤酒，一瓶普通酒，然后他们给我们每人十包香烟，供旅途上吸用。”
    被遣返的美国战俘虽然受到美军当局的严厉警告和监视，他们仍旧谈到一些朝中方面宽待战俘的事实。据路透社报道：美军上士何礼特说，在他两年半的战俘生活中，他受到的待遇“一点也不坏”。
    美国通讯社竭力歪曲、篡改和编造战俘们的谈话，但是，在他们的消息中终究也不能不透露出一些战俘们谈到的事实。美联社承认：哥伦比亚战俘派拉希奥说，被俘的哥伦比亚兵士的大部分时间，都是打篮球、乒乓球和玩扑克牌。美军一等兵艾伯特·季金尼说，他在被俘时腿上受伤，在四小时内就得到治疗。现在他已痊愈了。
