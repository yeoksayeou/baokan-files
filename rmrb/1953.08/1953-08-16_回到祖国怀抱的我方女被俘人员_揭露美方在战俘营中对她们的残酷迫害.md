Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 14th: Our female prisoners of war who have returned, after years of unwavering struggle against the various persecutions of the US side, resolutely demanding repatriation, have now finally returned to the warm embrace of the motherland. However, the terror and torment they experienced in the US POW camps is something they will never forget. They revealed to visiting reporters the various crimes committed by the US side in order to forcibly detain them.

They said that for more than two years, they were confined in POW camps surrounded by five or six layers of barbed wire, and each meal consisted of only a small bowl of barley rice. Many prisoners of war contracted diseases due to the poor treatment; the sick and injured often accounted for more than 30% of the total number, but the US side did not provide them with treatment, saying, "If you want to get treatment, you have to express your willingness to stay in South Korea." Some female prisoners of war died because they could not get treatment. In order to make them submit, the US side used various instruments of torture, such as the rack, splints, hanging ropes, fingernail pliers, toothed rubber whips, and electric shocks. Late at night, the screams of the victims often echoed from the POW camps. Some female prisoners of war developed mental illnesses under the beatings and atrocities of the US side.

However, our female prisoners of war did not succumb to the violence of the US side. They resolutely opposed the US side's illegal "screening" and atrocities, and demanded to return to their homeland. In May 1951, the US POW camp authorities sent two companies of troops to surround the female POW camp and conduct so-called "classification" of North and South Koreans in order to forcibly detain them. The US military drew a line on the ground, dividing it into North and South sides, and ordered that whoever went to which side would belong to that side. Our female prisoners of war protested this forced "classification" with silence. The US military whipped them with leather whips, and they sang patriotic songs and shouted slogans such as "We oppose forced classification!" and "Let all prisoners of war return to their homeland!" One female prisoner of war, whose home was in Hamgyongnam-do in northern Korea, was forcibly placed on the South side by the US military, who dragged her towards the prepared barbed wire fence. But she clung tightly to the barbed wire, tearing her skin, but refused to move. In order to forcibly drag her over, the US military took her belongings and snatched her two-year-old child from her arms. This kind of "classification" went on for almost a day, and the US side suddenly announced the cessation of "classification," insisting that the rest of the people who had not yet been "classified" were "South Koreans" who "did not want to be repatriated," and used more brutal repression to force them to submit.

On September 23, 1951, seventeen of our female prisoners of war were arrested by the US side for opposing the US side's forced detention and were subjected to electric shock eight times in a row. Xu Renshu, Yang Guiren, and a female prisoner of war surnamed Pei were paralyzed in their lower bodies due to inhuman torture, but they still insisted on demanding repatriation.

From November 1951 to March 1952, our female prisoners of war submitted 128 protests to the US POW camp authorities, demanding the repatriation of prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva Convention, and as many as 24,000 personal letters demanding repatriation.

However, on April 13, 1952, the US POW camp authorities again dispatched a large number of armed forces, eight tanks, and dozens of machine guns, menacingly surrounding the female POW camp to conduct so-called "voluntary repatriation" "individual interviews." In order to oppose the US side's forced detention, our female prisoners of war bravely held self-made flags of the Republic and answered the US personnel's inquiries by singing loudly and shouting slogans. The US armed forces violently tore their national flags, beat them, and forced them to interrogate them at gunpoint. They refused to answer, and the US personnel said, "Not answering means you want to stay in South Korea!" As soon as one person said, "I want to go back to my homeland!" the US personnel hurriedly said, "Oh! You want to go to South Korea!" and immediately dragged them away. One female prisoner of war said, "My home is in Pyongyang, I want to go to Pyongyang!" But the enemy said, "She doesn't want to go to Pyongyang." When they encountered female prisoners of war with children, the enemy pointed a shiny bayonet at the child and said, "If you want to go back to North Korea, eat this!" This is how the US side created a batch of so-called "refusal to repatriate" prisoners of war. But one night in April, many of them suddenly broke through the barbed wire and joined the female prisoners of war who were directly repatriated. This is how they were able to be repatriated this time.

In the autumn of 1952, the US prisoner of war camp authorities on Geoje Island announced that they would separate the female Korean People's Army prisoners of war with children from the single female prisoners of war. The US side said it would give these mothers and children "special treatment." However, in reality, the US side was giving them particularly bad treatment, trying to make the helpless mothers submit to the US side in order to support their children.

Kim Suk-ja and 22 other female prisoners of war with children jointly protested to the US side, resolutely opposing this. For more than a month, all the mothers wrote an average of two protest letters to the US side every day. However, at eight o'clock in the morning on October 3, the US side dispatched a battalion of troops wearing gas masks and fully armed, and tanks were set up outside the camp, and machine guns were set up, forcing everyone to come out to assemble. At that time, no one came out, so the US military threw fifteen gas bombs into the barracks, many people could not open their eyes, had difficulty breathing, and some people's skin was burned. US Major Aikers ordered the US military to drive everyone out of the house with wooden sticks and leather whips. The children were snatched from their mothers' backs by the US military and thrown on the ground, barbed wire, and under shiny bayonets. The mothers said with tears in their eyes, "The women of the Republic are not afraid of the enemy's violence, we will never separate!" At this time, Aikers, standing on the watchtower, threw another gas bomb at them, and then the US military threw out more than 30 gas bombs, and rifles and machine guns followed, and whips and wooden sticks also hit them. The mothers' cries, the children's cries, and Aikers' shouts of "Throw it again! Throw it again!" rang out. In this way, the US military forcibly separated the female prisoners of war with children from the single female prisoners of war.

Sure enough, the lives of the mothers and children after being separated were even more miserable. The mothers had to transport grain, carry firewood, fetch water, and sweep garbage by themselves, and children over the age of seven had to cook their own meals. Not long after the separation, all the mothers became ill, and there were no single female prisoners of war to help them, and they had to operate and take care of their children while sick. However, the mothers did not succumb. They also carried out a seven-day hunger strike against the enemy to oppose this separation. The children also hated the US military and loved their motherland even more. When Kim Suk-ja's daughter, Zhou Xian-zhu, returned, she wrote "Long Live Premier Kim Il-sung!" in large characters on her clothes.

The returned female prisoners of war are quietly recuperating under the care of the motherland, and they are all deeply concerned about their sisters who are still groaning in the US POW camps.

### 回到祖国怀抱的我方女被俘人员  揭露美方在战俘营中对她们的残酷迫害

    回到祖国怀抱的我方女被俘人员
    揭露美方在战俘营中对她们的残酷迫害
    【新华社开城十四日电】归来的我方女被俘人员，几年来，刚毅不屈地和美方的种种迫害进行斗争，坚决要求遣返，现在，她们终于回到了祖国温暖的怀抱。然而，她们在美方战俘营中所经历的恐怖和折磨，是她们永远不能忘记的。她们向访问的记者们揭露美方为了要强迫扣留她们所作出的种种罪行。
    她们说，两年多来，她们被关闭在围着五、六层铁丝网的战俘营里，每餐只能吃到不满一小碗的大麦饭。许多被俘人员由于恶劣的待遇得了疾病，病伤者常占全体人数的百分之三十以上，而美方不给她们治疗，他们说：“要想得到治疗，只有表示留在南朝鲜。”有些女被俘人员就因为得不到治疗而死亡。为了要使她们屈服，美方对她们使用了夹棍、夹板、吊绳、夹手指甲的钳子、带齿的橡皮鞭子和电刑等种种刑具。深夜，常常从战俘营里发出受难者的惨叫声。有的女被俘人员在美方的毒打和暴行下得了精神病。
    然而，我方女被俘人员并没有在美方暴力下屈服，她们坚决反对美方的非法“甄别”和暴行，要求重返祖国。一九五一年五月，美方战俘营当局派出两个连的兵力包围女战俘营，进行所谓南、北朝鲜人的“分类”，以便强迫扣留她们。美军在地上划一条线，分成南北两边，命令谁到哪一边谁就得到哪一边。我方女被俘人员用沉默来抗议这种强迫“分类”。美军用皮鞭抽打她们，她们就唱爱国歌曲，并高喊：“我们反对强迫分类！”“让全体战俘返回祖国！”等口号。有一个家住朝鲜北部咸镜南道的女被俘人员被美军硬划在南边，把她向事先准备好的铁丝网里拉。但是她紧抓住铁丝网，划破了皮肉也不走，美军为了要把她强拉过去，把她的东西抢去，并从她怀里夺去了她两岁的孩子。这样的“分类”进行了几乎一天，美方突然宣布停止“分类”，硬说其余尚未“分类”的人都是“不愿意遣返”的“南朝鲜人”，并用更残酷的镇压来迫使她们屈服。
    一九五一年九月二十三日，曾有十七个我方女被俘人员因反对美方强迫扣留而被美方抓去，一连受了八次电刑。有徐仁淑、杨桂仁和一个姓裴的三位女被俘人员因为受到惨无人道的刑罚而下身瘫痪，但是她们仍始终坚持要求遣返。
    从一九五一年十一月到一九五二年三月的五个月中，我方女被俘人员向美方战俘营当局提了一百二十八件抗议文，要求按照日内瓦公约遣返战俘，要求遣返的个人信件多达二万四千多封。
    可是，在一九五二年四月十三日，美方战俘营当局又出动了大量武装部队和八辆坦克、数十挺机枪，杀气腾腾地包围了女战俘营，进行所谓“自愿遣返”的“个人面会审问”。为了反对美方的强迫扣留，我方女被俘人员勇敢地拿着自制的共和国国旗，用高声唱歌和喊口号来回答美方人员的审问。美方武装部队强暴地把她们的国旗撕破，毒打她们，并用枪逼着她们进行审问。她们拒不回答，美方人员就说：“不回答就是愿意留在南朝鲜！”有一个人刚说一句：“我要回祖国去！”美方人员就急忙说：“哦！你就是要到南朝鲜！”马上拉走。有一个女被俘人员说：“我家在平壤，我要到平壤去！”敌人却说：“她不愿到平壤去。”遇到有孩子的女被俘人员，敌人便对孩子挺着明晃晃的刺刀说：“要想回北朝鲜去就吃这个！”美方就是这样制造了一批所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘。但是在四月的一个夜里，她们中间有许多人突然弄破了铁丝网冲出来，和直接遣返的我方女被俘人员汇合在一起。这样，她们才能在这次被遣返回来。
    一九五二年秋天，巨济岛美方俘虏营当局宣布要把带孩子的朝鲜人民军女被俘人员和单身的女被俘人员分开。美方说要给这些母亲和孩子们以“特别待遇”。然而，实际上，美方是要给她们特别恶劣的待遇，企图使无助的母亲们为了要养活自己的孩子而向美方屈服。
    金淑子等二十二个带有孩子的女被俘人员便联名向美方抗议，坚决反对这样做。在一个多月中，所有的母亲平均每个人每天都写给美方两封抗议信。然而，在十月三日的早晨八点钟，美方却出动了带着防毒面具、全副武装的一个营的兵力，在营场外摆起了坦克、架起了机枪，逼令大家出来集合，当时没有一个人出来，美军于是向营房里投了十五个毒气弹，许多人眼睛睁不开，呼吸困难，有的人皮肤被灼伤了。美军少校爱柯司命令美军用木棍和皮鞭把大家从屋子里赶出来。孩子们都从母亲们的背上被美军夺走，扔在地上、铁丝网上及明晃晃的刺刀下面。母亲们含着眼泪大声说：“共和国的女性决不怕敌人的暴力，我们决不分开！”这时，站在了望台上的爱柯司再向她们扔毒气弹，接着，美军也扔出三十多个毒气弹，步枪和机枪跟着响起来了，皮鞭和木棍随着也向她们身上打去。母亲们的呼唤声、孩子们的哭声和爱柯司“再扔呀！再扔呀！”的喊杀声响成一片。这样，美军才把有孩子的和单身女被俘人员强迫分开来。
    果然，被分开后的母亲们和孩子们的生活更加凄惨了。母亲们要自己去运粮食、搬柴火、抬水和打扫垃圾，七岁以上的孩子们都必须自己煮饭。隔离开后不久，所有的母亲都累病了，再也没有单身女被俘人员帮助她们，她们要带着病操作和照料孩子。但是，母亲们没有屈服。她们还曾对敌人进行了七天的绝食斗争，反对这种隔离。孩子们也更痛恨美军、热爱祖国了。金淑子的女孩子周贤珠归来时在自己衣服上写了“金日成首相万岁！”七个大字。
    归来的女被俘人员正在祖国的照顾下安静地休养，她们都深切地关怀着现在还呻吟在美方战俘营中的姊妹们。
