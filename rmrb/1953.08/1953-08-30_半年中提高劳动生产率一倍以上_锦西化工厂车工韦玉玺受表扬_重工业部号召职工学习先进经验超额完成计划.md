[Report from this newspaper] Jinxi Chemical Plant lathe operator Wei Yuxi has been deeply involved in technology, conscientiously studied advanced Soviet experiences, improved equipment, and improved operating methods, increasing his personal labor productivity by more than double in the past six months. The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government issued a circular calling on all workers in affiliated factories and mines to learn from Comrade Wei Yuxi's exemplary behavior and strive to complete and overfulfill state plans.

Comrade Wei Yuxi, a young lathe operator in the Mechanical Branch of Jinxi Chemical Plant, put forward an advanced plan to increase labor productivity by 200% when formulating his personal production plan in January of this year. In the course of practice in the past six months, he overfulfilled the original plan. As of June 15, he had completed an average of 226.465% of the work-hour quota for the first half of the year, increasing his personal labor productivity by more than double.

The main reason why Comrade Wei Yuxi was able to greatly improve labor efficiency was that, under his high political consciousness and high labor enthusiasm, he conscientiously studied advanced Soviet experiences, delved into technology, improved equipment, and improved operations. Comrade Wei Yuxi's main methods of increasing labor productivity are to shorten auxiliary time in work, improve technology, and increase machine tool efficiency. After studying and discovering the reasons for low work efficiency in the past, he made preparations before work, rationally arranged the work location, and placed tools and workpieces in appropriate positions to reduce the time for stopping or running empty cars in the middle and increase effective operation time; improved pulleys, increased lathe speed, improved cutting tools and cutting methods to increase cutting speed and cutting depth. Because Comrade Wei Yuxi adopted this correct and advanced method, his work achieved the following results: the lathe speed was increased from the original maximum of 305 revolutions per minute to the maximum of 617 revolutions per minute, the cutting speed was increased from the original maximum of 200 meters per minute to the maximum of 680 meters per minute, and the cutting depth was increased from 0.8 mm to 4 mm to 1.5 mm to 10 mm, the effective operating time increased from the original 50% to 80%, and the highest was 91%.

The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government pointed out in its circular that in the process of accelerating national industrialization, Comrade Wei Yuxi's practical actions to improve labor productivity are the glory and model of our enterprises, which is of great significance for learning and promoting advanced production technology, organizing labor competitions, and ensuring the completion and ahead-of-schedule completion of the 1953 and Five-Year National Economic Construction Plan. Comrade Wei Yuxi's achievements show that as long as we continuously carry out political and technical study, are proficient in the technology of our work, and master the laws of production, we can find the key to improving production and greatly improve production.

At present, many workers have been inspired by Wei Yuxi's exemplary behavior, actively learning advanced experience, and improving labor productivity. Inspired by Wei Yuxi, Chuo Baoshun, an electric welder at Jinxi Chemical Plant, improved his operating methods and learned the Soviet multi-strip welding method, which increased welding efficiency by more than double. The Zhang Qianfu team of the open hearth furnace section of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant learned from Wei Yuxi's exemplary behavior, improved the charging process and carried out strict division of labor, which greatly shortened the smelting time. Yang Fuchang, a lathe operator at Anshan Machinery General Factory, also improved his operating methods and improved work efficiency under the inspiration of Wei Yuxi. The Ministry of Heavy Industry pointed out in its circular that: quickly transforming Wei Yuxi's methods into the actions of a wider range of workers, and developing the initiative of "improving operating technology, giving full play to equipment efficiency, and improving work efficiency" into a broad mass movement will be a huge driving force, and it will be an important source of strength for completing the National Five-Year Economic Construction Plan. To this end, the Ministry of Heavy Industry specifically calls on all affiliated employees to learn from Comrade Wei Yuxi's labor attitude of improving labor production efficiency and accelerating the construction of the motherland, and requires all factories to attach importance to Wei Yuxi's exemplary behavior, conscientiously organize all employees to actively learn advanced experience, learn from Soviet experience, study work, improve production technology operations, give full play to equipment capabilities, and strive to ensure the completion and exceeding of national production plans.

    半年中提高劳动生产率一倍以上
    锦西化工厂车工韦玉玺受表扬
    重工业部号召职工学习先进经验超额完成计划
    【本报讯】锦西化工厂青年车工韦玉玺，深入钻研技术，认真学习苏联先进经验，改善设备，改进操作方法，半年来把个人劳动生产率提高一倍以上。中央人民政府重工业部发出通报，号召所属厂矿全体职工学习韦玉玺同志的模范行为，为完成和超额完成国家计划而奋斗。
    锦西化工厂机械分厂青年车工韦玉玺同志，在今年一月制订个人生产计划时，提出了百分之二百地提高劳动生产率的先进计划。在半年来的实践过程中，他超额完成了原订的计划，至六月十五日止平均完成了上半年工时定额的百分之二百二十六点四六五，把个人劳动生产率提高了一倍以上。
    韦玉玺同志所以能把劳动效率大大提高，主要是在他的高度政治自觉与高度的劳动热情之下，认真地学习了苏联先进经验，深入钻研技术，改善设备，改进操作的结果。韦玉玺同志提高劳动率的主要方法是缩短工作中的辅助时，改进技术，提高机床效率。他研究、发现过去工作效率低的原因以后，就在工作前做好准备，合理地安排工作地点，将工具、工作物都放在适当位置，以减少中途停车或转空车的时间，增加有效作业时间；改进皮带轮、提高车床转速、改进车刀和切削方法，以提高切削速度及切削深度。由于韦玉玺同志采取了这种正确的与先进的方法，就使他的工作达到了这样的成绩：将车床转速由原来的最高每分钟三百零五转提高到最高每分钟六百一十七转，切削速度由原来最高每分钟二百公尺提高到最高每分钟六百八十公尺，吃刀深度从零点八公厘到四公厘提高至一点五公厘到十公厘，有效作业时间由原来的百分之五十提高到百分之八十，最高曾达百分之九十一。
    中央人民政府重工业部通报中指出：在加速国家工业化的过程中，韦玉玺同志提高劳动生产率的实际行动是我们企业中的光荣和模范，这对于学习与推广先进的生产技术、组织劳动竞赛，保证争取与提前完成一九五三年及五年国家经济建设计划有着重大意义。韦玉玺同志的成就说明只要不断地进行政治与技术学习，精通了自己工作上的技术，掌握了生产中的规律，就能够找到提高生产的窍门，使生产大大提高一步。
    目前已有许多职工在韦玉玺模范行为的启发下，积极学习先进经验，提高了劳动生产率。锦西化工厂电焊工啜宝顺在韦玉玺的启发下改进了操作方法，并学习了苏联多条焊接法之后，使电焊效率提高了一倍多。太原钢铁厂平炉工段张千福小组学习韦玉玺的模范行为，改进了装料并进行了严格分工，使熔炼时间大大缩短。鞍山机械总厂车工杨富昌，也在韦玉玺的启发下，改进操作方法，提高了工作效率。重工业部通报中指出：迅速地把韦玉玺的方法转变成为更广大职工的行动，把“改善操作技术，发挥设备效能，提高工作效率”的创举发展成为一个广泛的群众运动，将是一种巨大的动力，它将是完成国家五年经济建设计划的重要力量源泉。为此，重工业部特号召所属全体职工学习韦玉玺同志提高劳动生产效率而加速对祖国建设的劳动态度，并要求各厂重视韦玉玺的模范行为，认真地组织全体职工积极学习先进经验、学习苏联经验，钻研工作，改善生产技术操作，发挥设备能力，为保证完成和超过国家生产计划而奋斗。
