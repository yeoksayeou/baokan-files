Engels on the worker-peasant alliance and the socialist transformation of agriculture
    ——Commemorating the 58th anniversary of Engels' death
    Zhang Youyi
    Today, fifty-eight years ago, Friedrich Engels, the great warrior and teacher of the proletariat, passed away.
    Engels, together with the great Marx, founded scientific socialism. After Marx's death, Engels became "the most outstanding scholar in the entire civilized world and the mentor of the modern proletariat" (Lenin). In both theoretical and practical activities, he, like Marx, left indelible achievements for the cause of proletarian liberation.
    Theoretical work on the peasant question is one of Engels' outstanding contributions. Although the basic question of Marxism is not the peasant question, and in Marxism, the peasant question is only raised as a question of the proletariat's allies, "this situation will not in the slightest degree deprive the peasant question of the serious and urgent significance that it undoubtedly has for the proletarian revolution." Because in the vast majority of countries, "peasants are a very important element of population, production, and political power," the peasant question becomes a key issue for the success or failure of the proletarian revolution, and a major issue in socialist construction after the proletariat seizes power. These questions were clearly resolved in Engels' brilliant works. Engels not only developed Marx's thoughts on the tactics of the proletarian struggle, scientifically demonstrating the necessity and possibility of the worker-peasant alliance, but also creatively contributed to the theory of transforming small-scale peasant economy and realizing the socialization of agriculture.

    From the experiences of the peasant and worker movements in various European countries, especially Germany and France, Engels summarized the lesson that the proletariat must win over the broad masses of peasants as its allies in order to lead the revolution to victory, and at the same time, the peasants' revolutionary struggle can only achieve true victory under the leadership of the proletariat.
    Historical facts have repeatedly proven that if the proletariat does not unite with the peasants and does not receive their support, it will be difficult to achieve its own liberation cause. As Marx pointed out, "Without this chorus (referring to the peasants' agreement with the proletarian revolution - translator), in all peasant countries, the proletarian revolution's solo would become a lament." As everyone knows, one of the major reasons for the failure of the Paris Commune in 1871 was the lack of coordination of peasant struggles and the failure to obtain timely assistance from the peasants.
    Therefore, Engels emphatically pointed out: In order to seize power, the socialist workers' party "should first go from the city to the countryside, and should become a force in the countryside." This party must expose the true faces of the bourgeoisie and landlords who pretend to be friends with the peasants, and turn the peasants from the reserve army of the bourgeoisie into the reserve army of the proletariat. "Can we safely abandon the doomed peasants to their false protectors until the peasants turn from passive enemies of the industrial workers into active enemies of the industrial workers?" Engels believed: "The more peasants we can bring to our side who have not really been transformed into proletarians but are still absorbed by us as peasants, the more rapid and easier the social transformation will be."
    After pointing out that "as an element of political power, peasants have so far only shown their indifference rooted in the isolated conditions of rural life in most cases," Engels confidently asserted, "This indifference is by no means insurmountable." Engels' judgment is based on historical materialism analysis.
    "Since 1848, the economic revolution has swept across the entire European continent." What comes with capital rule is the bankruptcy of small-scale peasant economy and the impoverishment of peasants. Coupled with the increasingly fierce struggle between the industrial proletariat and the bourgeoisie, it undoubtedly determines the political direction of the peasants. Engels summarized the situation in France at that time and said: "The development of capitalist forms of production cut off the lifeblood of small-scale agricultural production; this small-scale production is irresistibly perishing and declining." He described the worsening situation of French peasants: "The loss of village land rights far outweighs the abolition of heavy taxes; the number of farmers who cannot afford to raise livestock is constantly increasing." Capitalist production destroys the natural economy of the countryside with monetary economy and large-scale industry, causing peasants to "lose half of their past production work." "Indebtedness is becoming more widespread day by day, and it is becoming more burdensome for everyone." This doomed the peasants to be able to listen to socialist propaganda and turn to the proletariat. Marx also wrote in response to this situation: "The interests of the peasants are no longer in harmony with the interests of the bourgeoisie and with capital, as they were in the Napoleonic era, but are opposed to the interests of the bourgeoisie and to capital. Therefore, the peasants have found their natural allies and leaders in the urban proletariat (whose mission is to overthrow the bourgeois system)." It must be pointed out that Marx and Engels' scientific conclusion that the proletariat can win over the peasants as its allies has been fully confirmed by the experience of the proletarian revolutionary movements in various countries in the age of imperialism, especially the experience of the October Socialist Revolution. In our country's new democratic revolution, the worker-peasant alliance question has even more special significance.
    The vast peasantry includes some different classes. "Which ones can be attracted to the Social Democratic Party?" Engels asked the Social Democrats such a question. It was Engels who used the Marxist method of class analysis to give a clear answer to this question. In the article "Germany Before the Outbreak of the Revolution," Engels divided German peasants into four classes: first, the wealthier peasants (called large and middle peasants in Germany), who owned large fields and employed several agricultural laborers. "Their most natural political path is an alliance with the anti-feudal middle bourgeoisie in the cities." The second are small self-cultivating peasants, "whose land has mostly been mortgaged to others under extremely harsh conditions, so that the real landlord is not the peasant, but the usurious moneylender." The third are feudal tenant farmers, who "must pay rent forever or perform labor services for the lord, compensating a certain amount of labor." Finally, there are agricultural laborers, who "from birth to death, are always poor and hungry, slaves to their employers." The last three classes of peasants—small self-cultivating peasants, feudal tenant farmers, and agricultural laborers—may be attracted to participate in the revolution. "The revolution is in the interest of each of them, and once the revolutionary movement is properly launched, each of them can be expected to participate." Regarding this point, Engels has a more in-depth analysis in the preface to the second edition of his famous book "The German Peasant War." He wrote:
    "Small peasants (large peasants belong to the bourgeoisie) can be divided into various components. Some of them are bound by lords and masters under the serf system, and because the bourgeoisie has not fulfilled its responsibility to liberate these people from the serf system, it is easy to convince them that they can only get help from the working class; some are tenant farmers, whose situation is almost equal to that of Irish tenant farmers. The rent is so high that even in good years, farmers and their families can hardly maintain a simple life; in years of poor harvest, they honestly go hungry. When he cannot pay the rent, he is completely at the mercy of the landlord. The bourgeoisie only thinks of relief when forced to do so. So, where do these tenant farmers find relief other than from the workers?
    "There is another group of peasants who own a small piece of land themselves. In most cases, they are burdened with mortgages, so that they rely on usurers, just as tenant farmers rely on landlords. What they get is actually only meager wages, because these wages vary depending on the year's harvest. These people have no hope of getting anything from the bourgeoisie, because it is the bourgeoisie, that is, the capitalist usurer, who squeezes their blood... For these people, it must be made clear that they can only be liberated from the "exploitation" of usurers when the people's government turns all mortgages into national debts, thereby reducing land rents. But this can only be done by the working class.
    "In places where middle landlords and large landlords dominate, rural wage laborers form the largest class. ... Urban industrial workers find the largest number and natural allies here. ... Their living conditions are the same as those of industrial workers, and they fall into the trap of hardship even deeper than urban workers. ... To awaken the life of this class and attract it into the movement is the most urgent task of the German workers' movement."
    According to Engels' analysis, in capitalist countries, only rural proletarians and small peasants have revolutionary potential and can become allies of the working class. In criticizing the first land program of the French Social Democratic Party, Engels more clearly defined the scope of the working class's allies among the peasants and the basic policies of the working class party toward middle peasants and large peasants. He categorically stated: "I firmly deny that the socialist workers' party of any country has the task of absorbing not only rural proletarians and small peasants, but also middle peasants and large peasants, or even large-estate tenants, capitalist ranchers, and other capitalist developers of state land into its ranks." Then, he pointed out that the workers' party can only unite with the above-mentioned rural middle bourgeoisie and large bourgeoisie under certain preconditions and within a certain period of time,
    "Let feudal land ownership be the common enemy of all of them. We can walk with them on some issues, and we can fight hand in hand with them for certain purposes for a certain period of time." It goes without saying that Engels' specific analysis of the various classes in the countryside and his determination of the content of the proletariat's allies have major guiding significance for the tactics of the proletarian revolutionary movement.
    The proletariat needs to ally with the peasants for its own liberation; this is one aspect of the matter. On the other hand, if the peasants do not ally with the proletariat and do not have the leadership and help of the proletariat, they cannot achieve true and final liberation. Regarding this point, Engels, based on his historical materialist viewpoint and rich historical knowledge, put forward extremely incisive scientific arguments.
    The peasants' mode of production and lifestyle create their mutual isolation and dispersion. The small-scale peasant economy is almost self-sufficient. The means of livelihood of each farm household are obtained less from social interactions and more from natural exchanges, that is, mostly directly produced by themselves. Therefore, the peasant masses are just like Marx's analogy, "as if a bag of potatoes is made up of the potatoes in the bag." When Engels discussed the German peasants and the Peasant War, he wrote: "Although the peasants were incited under terrible oppression, it was not easy to encourage them to revolt. Because they are scattered in various places, it is extremely difficult to get a common understanding; the habit of obedience passed down from generation to generation, the lack of practice in the use of weapons in many places, and the degree of exploitation varies depending on the personality of their masters; all this keeps the peasants quiet." In the 1525 Peasant War, the peasants in each province "acted only for themselves, often refusing to assist the revolting peasants in neighboring areas, so that they were successively suppressed in individual wars by troops that were less than one-tenth of the total number of revolting masses. ... The various peasant armies were not united according to the commonality of their actions, whether large or small—the only possible union—but only according to the commonality of the particular enemies against them, which is clear evidence of the peasants' mutual indifference in various provinces."
    The peasants' dispersion, parochialism, and conservatism doomed "their inability to protect their class interests in their own name," doomed them to be unable to independently launch a revolution or win a revolution. Therefore, after inferring that the small self-cultivating peasants, feudal tenant farmers, and agricultural laborers among the peasants might be involved in the revolutionary wave, Engels immediately pointed out: "But at the same time, it is also very clear and has been proven by the history of all modern countries that because peasants are scattered in vast areas, it is extremely difficult to reach a consensus of opinion, and they can never attempt to achieve a victorious independent movement; they need the leadership and impetus of the more concentrated, more knowledgeable, and easier to mobilize people in the cities." Thus, the results of the peasant movement cannot but be determined by the intentions of the peasants' leaders.
    Countless historical facts have proven that if the peasants do not have the help and leadership of the urban working class, their struggle against feudal landlords will either fail completely or the fruits of the revolution will be usurped by other leading groups or classes. It is precisely in this way that the "peasant revolutions" in China's past dynasties "always ended in failure, and were always used by landlords and nobles in the revolution and after the revolution as tools for them to change dynasties." The peasants in some Western European countries joined the bourgeoisie in opposing the feudal system during the bourgeois revolution, or were sold out by the bourgeoisie, or were freed from feudal exploitation and then fell into capitalist exploitation. Engels wrote: "The strange phenomenon is that in all three bourgeois revolutions, the fighting army was the peasantry. But the peasants are precisely such a class, which, after the victory, went bankrupt because of the economic results of this victory." The failure of the German Peasant War in 1525 "was mainly due to the incompletion of the party with the most vested interests, the urban bourgeoisie." The Prussian peasants in 1848 "used the revolution to get rid of all feudal shackles at once. But here... the middle class immediately turned against their earliest and most indispensable allies—the peasants;... feudalism was restored in the hands of the bourgeoisie, which was anti-feudal yesterday." The second great uprising of the bourgeoisie that occurred in England won victory due to the participation of small landowners and urban commoners, but "a century after Cromwell, the self-cultivating small landowners in England almost completely disappeared." The French Revolution thoroughly eliminated the feudal system, and the result was the development of the capitalist mode of production, "and the situation of the peasants became worse and worse," as Marx said, "individual capitalists exploit individual peasants through land mortgages and usury, and the bourgeoisie exploits the peasant class through state taxes." All of this shows that: if the peasants want to achieve final liberation, not to get rid of one shackle and put on another, not to get rid of the pain of feudal exploitation and fall into the pain of capitalist exploitation, it is only possible to ally with the most revolutionary working class and accept its leadership.
    The above is the basic content of Engels' theory on the worker-peasant alliance question.
    The successors of Marx and Engels, the great Lenin and Stalin, ruthlessly condemned the indifferent attitude adopted by the Second International parties toward the peasant question, attacked the counter-revolutionary theories of the Mensheviks and Trotskyites against the worker-peasant alliance, and adhered to and specifically developed the principle of the worker-peasant alliance proposed by Marx and Engels. Lenin and Stalin flexibly applied this principle under different historical conditions and creatively put forward three basic slogans of the Bolsheviks on the peasant question one after another: in the period of bourgeois democratic revolution, uniting all peasants, opposing the Tsar and landlords, and neutralizing the bourgeoisie; in the period of proletarian revolution, uniting poor peasants, neutralizing middle peasants, and opposing urban and rural capitalism; and in the period of socialist construction after the proletariat seized power, relying on poor peasants, establishing agreements with middle peasants, and never stopping the struggle against rich peasants. These three slogans guaranteed the victory of the revolution and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, further creatively applied Lenin and Stalin's basic principles regarding the nature of the peasant movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries and the relationship between the proletarian party and the peasant masses here to the practice of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao believed that the Chinese revolution was essentially a peasant revolution, and the central issue of the working class's leadership was the peasant question; he insisted that the Party must lead the peasant movement. This correct line opposed both the right-leaning opportunism that only saw the bourgeoisie and the Kuomintang and did not see the peasants, and the "left"-leaning opportunism that only saw the workers and did not see the peasants, thereby leading the Chinese people's revolution to final victory.
    The Marxist-Leninist principle of the worker-peasant alliance, after the specific application and development by Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao, is increasingly showing its invincible power. The enormous role of this principle can also be seen from Stalin's argument. Stalin said: "In the field of economics, discovering and applying new laws that violate the interests of the decaying forces of society will encounter extremely strong resistance from these forces. Therefore, there must be a force that can overcome this resistance, a social force. In our country, this force has been found, and its form is the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, which accounts for the vast majority of society. This force has not yet been found in other countries, that is, capitalist countries. The secret of why the Soviet regime was able to crush the old social forces and why the economic law that the relations of production must conform to the nature of the productive forces has obtained a fully broad place to play a role in our country lies in this." Therefore, learning and mastering the Marxist-Leninist principle of the worker-peasant alliance has become an important task for the working-class parties of all countries.
    × × × ×
    Engels' contribution to the peasant question is not only to generally propose and discuss the question of the alliance between the proletariat and the peasants in carrying out the revolution. His creative contribution also lies in clearly resolving such a major issue, that is: how should the proletariat treat small peasants after seizing power? This question is essentially how to transform the small-scale peasant economy and realize the socialistization of agriculture. All of Engels' thoughts in this regard are concentrated in his brilliant work "The Peasant Question in France and Germany," published one year before his death.
    This question is inseparable from the worker-peasant alliance question. If the workers' party provides inappropriately in its program or handles it improperly in practice, it may throw the peasants into the camp of the workers' enemies. "The small peasant, as the predecessor of the proletarian, should have been happy to listen to socialist propaganda. But deep-rooted private ownership ideas sometimes hinder him from doing this. The more arduous his struggle to maintain his small, precarious piece of land, the more stubbornly and desperately he clings to this small piece of land, and the more inclined he is to regard the Social Democrats who tell him to transfer land property to the hands of the entire society as dangerous enemies just like usurers and lawyers." Facing this situation, what program can the workers' party propose to the small peasants in order to win over allies? Can we abandon the basic principles of socialism, allow the protection of their property under any circumstances, and turn their small, private land into eternal, unchanging private property?
    Engels' answer is a complete denial. Engels condemned the land program adopted by the French socialists at the Marseilles Congress in 1892, which "attempted to prove that the socialist principle includes protecting small peasants' private property from extinction under the capitalist mode of production," and "this extinction is inevitable." He emphatically pointed out: "The task of socialism lies only in transferring the means of production to the collective possession of the producers," and "we must fight for the transfer of the means of production to collective possession with all the means of the proletariat." Engels' regulation on the future of socialism is that "collective possession of the means of production is put forward as the only main goal that must be fought for. This is not only the case in the industry where the foundation has already been laid, but also everywhere, that is, in agriculture. According to the program (referring to the program of the French socialists - translator), individual possession has never existed as a common phenomenon of all producers at any time and in any place. For this reason, and also because individual possession is originally excluded by the progress of industry, what socialism is concerned about is by no means to maintain individual possession, but to exclude it, because wherever individual possession still exists, collective possession is impossible."
    The "French Program" loses the socialist principle in order to win over the peasants as allies of the working class. However, doing so obviously cannot achieve the purpose of the worker-peasant alliance. Engels blamed the French socialists, saying, "Your attempt to protect small peasants from their private property is not protecting their freedom, but merely protecting a special form of their slave status." He believed: "If we can do this, then we will return to such a system, from which the existing system will inevitably re-develop. We have not liberated the peasants, but only delayed their demise for a short time." He clearly pointed out: "If we give promises to make the peasants suspect, even a little, that we mean to maintain small land ownership for a long time, then this will not only be the worst help for the Party but also for the small peasants themselves. This is tantamount to simply closing the road to the liberation of the peasants and lowering the Party to the level of vulgar anti-Semitism."
    However, can Engels' meaning be understood as that the proletariat must begin to expropriate the small and medium-sized producers in the countryside and socialize their means of production after seizing power? On the contrary, Engels emphasized that "our French comrades are completely correct on one point: if any solid reform is impossible in France against the will of the small peasants." His specific answer to the question of whether small peasants can be expropriated is:
    "First, the following proposition of the French program is completely correct, that is, we foresee that small peasants will inevitably perish, but we should in no way accelerate this demise by our own intervention.
    "Second, it is equally obvious that when we seize state power, we cannot at all imagine using violence to expropriate small peasants (whether there is compensation or not is irrelevant), just as we have to do for large landowners." In Engels' view, even large and middle peasants will probably not need to be expropriated by force. "If these peasants understand that their current mode of production will inevitably perish and draw the necessary conclusions from it, then let them come to us, and our duty is to try to make it easier for them to transition to a new mode of production."
    Since farmers cannot be expropriated by force, how should socialist principles be implemented? Here, Engels put forward his correct line for transforming the small-scale peasant economy. Engels taught: "Our task for small peasants is first to transform their private production and private ownership into cooperative production and cooperative ownership, but not by using coercive means, but by providing examples and suggesting social assistance to achieve this goal. At that time, we will of course have enough resources to make the small peasants understand the benefits they should already understand."
    The main point of this programmatic instruction is, first, to determine that the path of collectivization is the only practical and feasible path for transforming the small-scale peasant economy, and is the only way to the socialistization of agriculture. Second, it pointed out that it is necessary to use education and enlightenment methods and necessary assistance to induce small peasants to change from individual economy to cooperative economy, and coercive measures cannot be used. Regarding the necessity of adhering to the principle of voluntariness in realizing agricultural collectivization, Engels wrote: "We will do everything possible to make their fate better, and if they are determined, we will make it easier for them to transition to the cooperative, and if they are still unable to make up their minds, we will give them some time to consider on their own small plots of land." Of course, Engels' respect for the peasants' voluntariness cannot be understood as letting things take their own course. On the contrary, Engels emphasized the necessity of actively educating and enlightening the peasants. He said:
    "The main problem here is to make the peasants clearly see that in order to save and maintain their manors and land ownership, they can only turn them into the ownership and production of cooperatives. It is the individual economy restricted by individual ownership that leads the peasants to demise. If they insist on their individual economy, they will inevitably lose their land and manors, and large-scale capitalist economy will squeeze out their outdated mode of production." "It is the duty of our Party to explain to the peasants at all times and in all places: as long as capitalism dominates, their situation is completely desperate, and they can never maintain their small land ownership in that way. They should absolutely believe that large-scale capitalist production will crush their weak and outdated small production, just as a train on a railway crushes a wheelbarrow." Engels also pointed out that agricultural cooperatives with fully available socialist economic conditions can be used as examples to "persuade the last resisting small peasants." Regarding how the government should help the peasants move towards the road of collectivization, Engels wrote: "Under the connection of small plots of land, and under the large-scale management of this entire connected field, a part of the labor force that was used in the past will become surplus; one of the main advantages of large-scale management lies in the saving of this labor. There are two ways to find work for these labor forces: either allocate land from nearby large estates to peasant cooperatives, or give them the resources and possibilities to carry out sideline work, even if mainly for their own consumption. In both cases, they will be in a better economic position, and this will at the same time ensure that the central social regime has the necessary influence to gradually transform peasant cooperatives into higher forms and equalize the rights and obligations of the entire cooperative and its individual members with the rights and obligations of other parts of the entire group. As for how to specifically realize this in each individual occasion, it will depend on the circumstances of the occasion and on the circumstances in which we are able to seize power. It is possible that we can provide these cooperatives with more benefits in this way: the state bank accepts all their mortgaged debts and greatly reduces their interest; subsidies are drawn from public funds to help establish large-scale production (subsidies do not necessarily or only be limited to money, but can also be necessities: machines, artificial fertilizers, etc.), as well as other benefits." His comprehensive instruction is: "We can be very generous to the peasants." Finally, Engels estimated that the peasants can be completely awakened with the help of the working class. He said: "If we do this, then our actions will be adapted to the inevitable economic development, and the economic development will clean the peasants' minds and make them understand what we are talking about." He even believed that the economic development can also educate "these stubborn heads" like large and middle peasants.
    In summary, on the question of how the proletariat should treat small peasants after seizing power, Engels opposed both abandoning the basic principles of socialism to accommodate the peasants' private ownership ideas and using violence to expropriate the peasants. Instead, he advocated achieving the goal of agricultural socialistization through collectivization, and the method is to actively enlighten the peasants' consciousness with educational methods and necessary assistance, so that they voluntarily embark on the road of cooperation, rather than taking coercive measures. This is Engels' principle of transforming small-scale peasant economy and realizing agricultural socialistization.
    As is well known, Engels' principle has become the unwavering guiding principle for the working-class parties of all countries on the socialist transformation of agriculture. Lenin's cooperative plan is a further development and concretization of Engels' principle. Stalin also enriched and developed Lenin's ideas on agricultural collectivization from practice and formed a complete theory of socialist agricultural collectivization. After the promotion and development by Lenin and Stalin, and the test of the socialist construction practice of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, the correctness and great significance of Engels' principle have become increasingly clear. It must be emphasized that Engels' principle is based on the existence of small-scale peasant economy and small land ownership. Therefore, for countries like ours where small-scale peasant economy and small private owners occupy an absolute advantage, the suitability of this principle is even broader. Chairman Mao's principle of "organizing" and the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Mutual Aid and Cooperation in Agricultural Production" are brilliant examples of the combination of the general theory of Marxist-Leninist agricultural collectivization and the specific characteristics of the Chinese countryside.
    Our motherland is now beginning to enter a new historical period, and we are facing the great tasks of realizing national industrialization and gradually transitioning to a socialist society. Agriculture is the foundation for developing industry, and the upsurge in industrial construction cannot but require a corresponding steady socialist transformation of agriculture. Therefore, today, it is of more urgent significance for us to study the theory of the socialist transformation of agriculture by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

    恩格斯论工农联盟和农业的社会主义改造问题
    ——纪念恩格斯逝世五十八周年
    章有义
    五十八年前的今天，无产阶级的伟大战士和导师弗里德利赫·恩格斯与世长辞了。
    恩格斯同伟大的马克思一道，创立了科学的社会主义。在马克思逝世后，恩格斯成为“整个文明世界中最卓越的学者和现代无产阶级底导师”（列宁）。他在理论的活动和实际的活动上，同马克思一样，给无产阶级的解放事业留下了不可磨灭的功绩。
    在农民问题上的理论工作，是恩格斯的杰出的贡献之一。虽则马克思主义的基本问题不是农民问题，在马克思主义中，农民问题只是当作无产阶级的同盟军问题而被提出的，“可是，这个情况，丝毫也不会使农民问题丧失其对于无产阶级革命所无疑具有的那种严重迫切的意义。”〔一〕由于在绝大多数国家中“农民是人口、生产和政治力量底非常重要的要素，”〔二〕所以农民问题成为无产阶级革命成败的关键问题，成为无产阶级取得政权后的社会主义建设中的重大问题。这些问题在恩格斯的天才著作中，得到了明确的解决。恩格斯不只是发挥了马克思关于无产阶级斗争策略的思想，科学地论证了工人和农民联盟的必要性和可能性，而且创造性地贡献了关于改造小农经济和实现农业社会主义化的理论。
    ×    ×    ×
    恩格斯从欧洲各国，特别是德国和法国的农民运动和工人运动的经验中，总结出这样的教训：无产阶级必须争取广大农民群众作为自己的同盟者，才能领导革命走向胜利，而同时，农民的革命斗争，又只有在无产阶级的领导之下才能够得到真正的胜利。
    历史的事实反复证明了无产阶级如果不与农民联合，如果得不到农民的支持，便很难成就自己的解放事业，正如马克思所指出的，“如果没有这合唱
    （指农民对无产阶级革命的附合——笔者），那么，在一切农民国度中，无产阶级的革命的独唱，就会变成哀歌。”〔三〕大家知道，一八七一年巴黎公社失败的重大原因之一，也正在于缺少农民斗争的配合，在于没有及时得到农民的帮助。
    因此，恩格斯强调地指出：社会主义工人政党为了夺取政权，“应当首先从城市走到乡村，应当成为乡村中的力量。”这个政党必须揭露假装和农民作朋友的资产阶级和大地主底真面目，把农民从资产阶级的后备军变为无产阶级的后备军，“能不能安然无事地把注定灭亡的农民摒弃在他们的伪保护者手中，一直到农民从工业工人底消极敌人变成工业工人的积极敌人吗？”恩格斯认为：“我们能使之不真正转变为无产者而把他们仍然作为农民吸收到我们这方面来的农民人数愈多，社会变革的进行也就愈加迅速和愈加容易。”〔四〕
    在指出“作为政治力量底要素，农民至今在多数场合下仅仅表现出自己的那种生根于农村生活孤僻状况中的冷漠态度”之后，恩格斯满怀信心地断定
    “这种冷漠态度决不是不可克服的。”〔五〕恩格斯的这一论断是以历史唯物主义的分析为基础的。
    “自一八四八年以来，经济革命袭取了整个欧洲大陆”，随资本统治而来的，就是小农经济的破产，和农民的贫困化。加以工业无产阶级反对资产阶级的斗争日益猛烈，无疑地决定了农民的政治动向。恩格斯总结当时法国的情况说：“资本主义生产形式底发展，割断了农业小生产底命脉；这种小生产不可抑制地在灭亡着和衰落着。”他这样描述法国农民每况愈下的境遇：“村社土地权底丧失大大地胜过苛税底废除；没有可能饲养耕畜的农民数目是不断地在增长着。”资本主义生产以货币经济和大规模工业破坏了农村的自然经济，使农民“丧失了自己过去的生产工作底一半。”“负债是一天天地普遍起来，而且对于每个人是一天天地更加沉重。”〔六〕这就注定了农民有可能倾听社会主义的宣传，有可能投靠无产阶级。马克思也曾针对这一形势写道：“农民底利益已不再是像拿破仑时代那样，与资产阶级底利益相协调、与资本相协调，而是与资产阶级的利益相对立、与资本相对立。因此，农民在城市无产阶级的身上（城市无产阶级底使命是推翻资产阶级的制度）找到了他们的自然的同盟者和领导者。”〔七〕必须指出：马克思和恩格斯关于无产阶级有可能争取农民为自己的同盟者的科学论断已经为帝国主义时代各国无产阶级革命运动的经验，特别是十月社会主义革命的经验所完全证实了。而在我国的新民主主义革命，工农联盟问题则更具有特殊的意义。
    广大的农民包括着一些不同的阶层。“有哪些是可以吸引到社会民主党方面来的呢？”恩格斯给社会民主党人提出了这样一个问题。也正是恩格斯运用了马克思主义的阶级分析方法，给予这个问题以明确的答复。在“革命爆发前的德国”一文中，恩格斯把德国农民分作四个阶层：第一是较富裕的农民（在德国叫做大农与中等农民），他们拥有广大田场，雇用几个农业劳动者，“他们底最自然的政治道路是与城市中反封建的中等资产阶级联盟。”第二是小的自耕农，“他们底土地大都已经在极苛刻的条件之下极可悲地抵押给了人家，以致真正的地主不是农民，而是放债的高利贷者了。”第三是封建佃农，他们“必得永远纳租，或永远为领主服力役，报效若干数量的劳动。”最后是农业劳动者，他们“由生而死，在任何时候都是贫穷饥饿，作他们雇主的奴隶。”农民中后面这三个阶层——小自耕农、封建佃农与农业劳动者有可能被吸引参加革命，“革命对于他们每个人都有利益，革命运动一旦被适当地开展，可望每个人都会参加。”〔八〕关于这点，恩格斯在他的名著“德国农民战争”一书的第二版序言中，还有更深入的分析。他写道：
    “小农（大农属于资产阶级）可分为各种不同的成份。他们有些在农奴制度之下，受领主和主人的束缚，因为资产阶级未尽它的责任把这些人从农奴制度下解放出来，所以容易使他们信服只有从工人阶级方面得到救助；有些是佃农，他们的状况几乎与爱尔兰的佃农相等。地租是如此之高，即在丰年，农民和其家庭也难维持朴素的生活；到了收成恶劣的年份，就老实饿肚子。当他不能缴纳地租的时候，完全听从地主摆布。资产阶级只在迫不得已的情形下面才想法救济。那么，于工人之外，这些佃农从何处寻找救济呢？
    “还有别一种农民集团，他们自己有一小块土地。在大部分场合，他们负了典押重担，以致依靠高利贷者，正如佃农依靠地主一样。他们所得到的，实际上只是菲薄的工钱，因为年岁丰歉不同，这点工钱亦变易不定，这些人想从资产阶级得一点东西，丝毫没有希望，因为榨取他们血液的是资产阶级，即资本家高利贷者。……对于这些人必须使其明白，只有民众的政府把所有典押变成国家债款，借此减轻地租的时候，他们才能从高利贷者“剥削”之下解放出来。可是这件事只有工人阶级才能做到。
    “在中地主和大地主占优势的地方，农村工钱劳动者形成人数最多的阶级。……城市产业工人在这里得到人数最多的和天然的同盟者。……他们与产业工人的生活情形相同，而且他们落到困苦的陷阱中比城市工人还要更深些。……唤起这个阶级的生命，把它吸引到运动中，即德国工人运动最迫切的任务。”〔九〕
    根据恩格斯的分析，在资本主义国家，农村人口中，只有农村无产者和小农才具有革命可能性，才可以成为工人阶级的同盟者。在批评法国社会民主党的第一个土地纲领时，恩格斯更明确地规定了工人阶级在农民中的同盟军的范围，规定了工人阶级政党对待中等农民和大农的基本政策。他斩钉削铁地说道：“我坚决否认任何国家底社会主义工人政党有任务除了吸收农村无产者和小农以外，还将中等农民和大农，或者甚至将大领地租佃者、资本主义牧畜者以及国家土地底其他资本主义开拓者，也都吸收到自己的队伍中来。”接着，他又指出了工人政党只有在一定的前提下、在一定时期内才可以联合上面所提到的农村中等资产阶级和大资产阶级，
    “且让封建主义土地占有制是他们大家的共同敌人。我们在某些问题上可以和他们一道走，我们在一定时期可以为着某些一定的目的与他们手携手地奋斗。”〔十〕不用说恩格斯对农村各阶级的具体分析和对无产阶级的同盟军的内容的确定，在无产阶级革命运动的策略上，是具有重大的指导意义的。
    无产阶级为着自己的解放，需要与农民联盟，这是事情的一方面。另一方面，农民如果不与无产阶级联盟，没有无产阶级的领导和帮助，也不能得到真正的最后的解放。关于这点，恩格斯根据他的历史唯物主义的观点和丰富的历史知识，提出了极其精辟的科学论证。
    农民的生产方式和生活方式造成他们的互相隔离和散漫的状态。小农经济差不多是自给自足的，每
    一农家的生活资料得自与社会交往者少，而得自与自然交换者多，也就是说，大部分是自己直接生产的。因此，农民群众恰如马克思所比喻的“好像马铃薯一袋是由袋中的马铃薯所构成的那样。”〔十一〕恩格斯论述德国的农民和农民战争时，写道：“虽说农民在可怕的压迫之下被煽动了，然而要怂恿他们暴动却不容易。因为散居各地，想使他们得到一个共同的了解极感困难；世代相传的服从习惯，在许多地方缺乏武器使用的练习，剥削程度的深浅视其主人之个性而异，凡此一切使农民安静了。”在一五二五年农民战争中，各省农民“只为自己而行动，经常不肯援助邻近区域的暴动农民，以致在个别的战争中顺次为不及暴动群众总数十分之一的军队所剿灭。……各种农军不是按照自己行动或大或小的共同性，——唯一可能的联合——而联合，只是按照与自己对抗之特别仇敌的共同性而联合，即为各省农民彼此漠视的显明证据。”〔十二〕
    农民的散漫性、偏狭性和保守性注定了“他们没有能力用自己名义来保护自己的阶级利益”，〔十三〕注定了他们不能独立地发动革命或赢得革命的胜利。所以恩格斯在推断农民中的小自耕农、封建佃农与农业劳动者可能卷入革命的浪潮之后，紧接着就指出：“但同时，这也是同样十分明显而且被一切现代国家的历史证明了的，就是：农民由于分散于广大地区，极难得到大多数意见的一致，是永远不能企图得到一个胜利的独立的运动的；他们需要城市里更集中、更有知识、更易动员起来的人民的领导和推动。”〔十四〕从而农民运动的结果就不能不随农民的领导者的意图为转移了。
    无数的历史事实证明：农民如果没有城市工人阶级的帮助和领导，则他们反对封建地主的斗争，不是根本失败，就是让别的领导集团或阶级篡夺革命的果实。正是这样，中国历代“农民革命总是陷于失败，总是在革命中和革命后被地主和贵族利用了去，当作他们改朝换代的工具。”〔十五〕西欧一些国家的农民曾在资产阶级革命时，与资产阶级一道去反对封建制度，或是被资产阶级出卖了，或是解脱了封建的剥削而又转陷于资本主义的剥削。恩格斯写道：“奇特的现象是：在所有三次资产阶级大革命中，战斗的军队是农民。而农民却正是这么一个阶级，它在胜利之后，却反因这一胜利的经济结果而破产了。”一五二五年德国农民战争的失败“主要是由于最有切身利益的党派、城市资产阶级的不彻底。”〔十六〕一八四八年普鲁士农民“利用革命一下子解脱了一切的封建枷锁。可是在这里……中等阶级立即转而反对他们最早的最不可少的联盟者——农民；……封建制度便在昨天还是反封建的资产阶级手里恢复了。”〔十七〕发生于英国的资产阶级第二次大起义，由于小土地所有者与城市平民分子的参与而获得胜利，可是“克伦威尔之后一世纪，英国的自耕的小土地所有者差不多完全消失了。”〔十八〕法国大革命彻底地消灭了封建制度，其结果是资本主义生产方式的发展，“农民便每况愈下了”，〔十九〕有如马克思所说的“个别的资本家经土地押款和高利贷以剥削个别的农民，资产阶级经国家租税以剥削农民阶级。”〔二○〕所有这一切说明了：农民要得到最后的解放，不至于摆脱了一个锁枷又套上另外一个锁枷，不至于摆脱了封建剥削的痛苦，又陷入资本主义剥削的痛苦，只有和最革命的工人阶级联盟而接受其领导，才是可能的。
    以上这些，就是恩格斯关于工农联盟问题的理论底基本内容。
    马克思、恩格斯事业的继承人，伟大的列宁和斯大林无情地斥责了第二国际政党对于农民问题所采取的冷淡态度，打击了孟什维克和托洛茨基派反对工农联盟的反革命理论，而坚持了并具体地发展了马克思、恩格斯所提出的工农联盟的原则。列宁和斯大林在不同的历史条件下，灵活地运用了这个原则，创造地先后提出了布尔什维克在农民问题上的三个基本口号：在资产阶级民主革命时期是联合全体农民，反对沙皇和地主，中立资产阶级；在无产阶级革命时期是联合贫农、中立中农、反对城乡资本主义；在无产阶级夺取政权以后的社会主义建设时期是依靠贫农、与中农成立协定，一分钟也不停止反富农斗争。这三个口号，保证了革命的胜利，巩固了无产阶级专政。中国人民伟大领袖毛主席进一步将列宁、斯大林关于殖民地半殖民地国家农民运动的性质，和无产阶级政党与这里农民群众的关系的基本原则，创造性地运用到中国革命的实践中来。毛主席认为中国的革命实质上是农民革命，工人阶级领导的中心问题就是农民问题；他坚持了党必须领导农民运动。这一正确的路线，既反对只看见资产阶级和国民党而看不见农民的右倾机会主义，也反对了只看见工人而看不见农民的“左”倾机会主义，从而给中国人民的革命引向最后胜利。
    马克思列宁主义的工农联盟原则经过列宁、斯大林和毛主席的具体运用和发展，日益显现其战无不胜的威力。关于这一原则的巨大作用，还可以从斯大林的一段论证中看出。斯大林说道：“在经济学领域中，发现和应用那些触犯社会衰朽力量的利益的新法则，却要遇到这些力量极强烈的反抗。因此，必须有能够克服这种反抗的力量、社会力量。在我国，找到了这种力量，其形式就是占社会绝大多数的工人阶级和农民的联盟。这种力量在其他国家、即资本主义国家中还没有找到。苏维埃政权之所以能够粉碎了旧的社会力量，而生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个经济法则之所以在我国获得了发生作用的充分广阔场所，其秘密就在于此。”〔二一〕因此，学习掌握马克思列宁主义的工农联盟原则，成为一切国家工人阶级政党的重要任务。

    恩格斯在农民问题上的贡献，并不只一般提出和论证无产阶级进行革命中与农民联盟的问题。他的创造性的贡献还在于明确地解决这样一个重大问题，那就是：无产阶级取得政权以后如何对待小农的问题。这个问题实质上就是如何改造小农经济和实现农业社会主义化的问题。恩格斯在这方面的全部思想，集中体现在他去世前一年发表的天才著作“法德农民问题”中。
    这个问题是和工农联盟问题分不开的。工人阶级政党对这个问题，如果在纲领中规定得不适当或是在实践中处理得不恰当，就可能把农民抛掷到工人阶级敌人的阵营中。“作为无产者前身的小农，本来应当乐意地倾听社会主义的宣传。但是根深蒂固的私有观念，有时候还阻碍他做到这一点。他之为保持他那一小块危机四伏的土地的斗争愈加艰苦，他便愈加顽固和拚命地守着这一小块土地不放，他便愈加倾向于把那些告诉他将土地财产转交给整个社会掌握的社会民主党人看作如同高利贷者和律师一样危险的敌人。”〔二二〕面对这种情况，为了争取同盟军，工人阶级政党能向小农提出什么纲领呢？可不可以放弃社会主义基本原则，允许在任何情况下保护他们的财产，把他们的零细的私有土地变成永恒不变的私有财产呢？
    恩格斯的回答是彻底的否定。恩格斯斥责法国社会主义者在一八九二年马赛代表大会上所通过的土地纲领“企图证明社会主义原则是包括着保护小农私有财产免于在资本主义生产方式下的灭亡”，而
    “这一灭亡是不可避免的。”他强调地指出：“社会主义底任务仅仅在于把生产资料转交给生产者集体占有”，“必须以无产阶级所有的一切办法来为生产资料之转到集体占有而斗争”。恩格斯对社会主义前途的规定是“生产资料之集体占有被提出来作为必须争取的唯一的主要目标。这不仅在基础已经打好了的工业方面是如此，而且在所有的地方，也就是说，在农业方面也是如此。按照纲领（指法国社会主义者纲领——笔者）讲来，个人占有在任何时候和任何地方都从未作为一切生产者共同的现象而存在过。正因如此，并且还因为个人占有本来就被工业的进展所排除，所以社会主义所关怀的决不是去维护个人占有，而是去排除它，因为凡是个人占有还存在的地方，集体占有就不可能。”〔二三〕
    “法国纲领”之丧失社会主义原则为的是要争取农民作为工人阶级的同盟军，但是，这样做，显然是不能达到工农联盟的目的的，恩格斯责备法国社会主义者，说“你们企图从其私有财产中保护小农，这不是保护他的自由，而仅仅是保护他的奴隶身份底特殊形式而已。”他认为：“假使我们能够这样做，那么我们便回到这样的一个制度去，从它里面将不可避免地重新发展出现有的制度。我们并没有解放农民，而只是把他们的灭亡缓延了一个短时间。”他明白指出：“如果我们给予诺言使农民那怕有一点藉口去推想我们的意思是指长期保持零细土地所有制，那么这并不仅对于党而且对于小农自己也是最坏不过的倒帮忙。这就等于把农民解放的道路简直封闭起来并把党降低到庸俗的排犹主义者底水平。”〔二四〕
    但是，可不可以把恩格斯的意思理解为无产阶级取得政权后就必须着手剥夺农村的中小生产者，使他们的生产资料公有化呢？恰恰相反，恩格斯强调了“我们的法国同志有一点是完全对的：如果违反小农底意志，任何巩固的改革在法国都是不可能的。”他关于能否剥夺小农这个问题的具体回答是：
    “第一，法国纲领底下列命题是完全正确的，即我们预见到小农不可避免地要灭亡，但我们无论如何不应该以自己的干涉去加速这种灭亡。
    “第二，同样地显而易见，当我们掌握了国家政权的时候，我们根本不能设想用暴力去剥夺小农
    （有无赔偿是无关重要的），就像我们对于大土地所有者所不得不作的一样。”在恩格斯看来，甚至对大农和中等农民大概也将无须实行强力的剥夺。“如果这些农民懂得他们现时的生产方式不可避免地要灭亡并从中作出必要的结论，那么就让他们到我们这里来吧，而我们的职责就在于尽力地使他们容易过渡到新的生产方式。”〔二五〕
    既然不能用暴力去剥夺农民，那么应该怎样贯彻社会主义原则呢？在这里，恩格斯提出了他的改造小农经济的正确路线。恩格斯教导说：“我们对于小农的任务首先是在于：将其私人的生产和私人的所有权变为协作社的生产和协作社的所有权，但决不是使用强迫的手段，而是凭借提供范例和建议社会帮助以达到这一目的。那时候我们当然会有足够的资力，使小农懂得他们现在本来就应该懂得的好处。”〔二六〕
    这一纲领性的指示的要点，首先就是确定了合作化的道路是改造小农经济的唯一切实可行的道路，是农业社会主义化的必经之路。其次指出了需要用教育和启发的方式以及必要的帮助来诱导小农变个体经济为合作经济，而不能使用强迫手段。关于实现农业合作化必需遵守自愿原则，恩格斯这样写道：“我们将尽一切可能使他们的命运较好些，如果他们下决心的话，就使他们易于过渡到协作社，如果他们还下不了决心的话，就给他们一些时间，让他们在自己的零细土地上考虑一下。”当然，恩格斯之尊重农民自愿并不能理解为放任自流，相反，恩格斯强调了积极地教育和启发农民的必要，他说道：
    “这里主要的问题是在于使农民明白地看到：要想挽救和保持他们的庄园和土地所有权，便只有把它们变成协作社的所有权和协作社的生产。正是被个人占有所制约着的个体经济把农民导向灭亡。如果他们坚持自己的个体经济，那末他们不可避免地将丧失土地和庄园，大规模的资本主义经济将排挤他们陈旧的生产方式。”“我们党底职责是随时随地向农民解释：只要资本主义还统治着，他们的处境便完全绝望，他们便绝对不可能保持他们那样的零细土地所有制，他们应该绝对相信资本主义的大规模生产将压碎他们的无力的过时的小生产，正如铁路上的火车压碎独轮手推车一样。”恩格斯还指出可以用社会主义经济条件已经完全具备的农业协作社为范例来“说服最后反抗的零细农民。”关于政府应该怎样帮助农民走向合作化的道路，恩格斯写道：“在零细土地底联结之下，以及在对这整个联结起来的田地进行大规模经营之下，一部分过去使用的劳动力就会变为多余的；大规模经营底主要优越点之一就在于劳动底这种贮蓄。给这些劳动力寻找工作，可以用两种方法：或是从邻近的大领地中拨出田地给农民协作社，或是给他们以资力和可能性去进行副业工作，那怕主要是为了他们自己的消费。在这两种情况下，他们都将处于较好的经济地位，并且这将同时保证中央社会政权具有必要的影响，逐渐把农民协作社转变为更高级的形式，并使整个协作社及其各别人员底权利和义务与整个集团其他各部分底权利和义务处于平等的地位。至于怎样具体地在每一个别场合下将这一点实现出来，那将决定于这一场合底情况如何，并且决定于我们得以夺取政权的那些情况如何。可能我们这样便能够给这些协作社提供更多的裨益：由国家银行收受它们的一切抵押的债项并将其利息大大减轻；从公共资金中抽拨补助金以帮助建立大规模生产（补助金不一定或者不只是限于金钱，而且可以是必需品：机器、人工肥料等等），还有其他的裨益。”他的一个概括性的指示就是：“我们对于农民是可以非常慷慨的。”最后，恩格斯估计到在工人阶级的帮助下农民是完全可以觉悟过来的。他说道：“如果我们这样作，那末我们的行动便适应于必然的经济发展，而经济发展则会清洗农民底头脑，使之了解我们所讲的话”。他甚至认为像大农和中等农民“这些顽固的脑袋，经济的发展也能够把他们教育过来的。”〔二七〕
    总括起来说，恩格斯在无产阶级在取得政权后怎样对待小农这个问题上，既反对放弃社会主义基本原则以迁就农民的私有观念，又反对使用暴力剥夺农民，而主张经由合作化的途径以达到农业社会主义化的目的，其办法是积极地用教育方式和必要的帮助以启发农民的觉悟，使其自愿地走上合作的道路，而不是采取强迫命令的手段。这就是恩格斯关于改造小农经济和实现农业社会主义化的原则。
    如所周知，恩格斯的原则已经成为各国工人阶级政党在农业的社会主义改造问题上的坚定不移的指导原则了。列宁的合作社计划则是恩格斯的原则之进一步发展和具体化。斯大林又从实践中丰富和发展了列宁的农业合作化的思想，而形成完整的社会主义农业集体化理论。经过列宁斯大林的推进和发展，以及苏联和各人民民主国家社会主义建设实践的检验，恩格斯的原则的正确性及其伟大意义愈来愈明显了。必须着重指出恩格斯的原则是以小农经济和小土地所有制的存在为出发点的，因而对于像我们这样小农经济和小私有者占绝对优势的国家来说，这个原则的适合性就更为广阔了。毛主席的
    “组织起来”的原则和“中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议”正是马克思列宁主义的农业集体化一般理论与中国农村的具体特点相结合的光辉范例。
    我们祖国现正开始进入一个新的历史时期，我们面临着实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会的伟大任务。而农业是发展工业的基础，工业建设的高涨不能不要求相应地稳步进行农业的社会主义改造。因此，在今天我们学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林关于农业的社会主义改造的理论，就更有其迫切的意义了。
