The Beijing Municipal People's Government has carried out planned sanitation construction work in the past three years. From 1950 to 1952, a total of 275 kilometers of sewers were dredged and renovated, and 97.4 kilometers of new sewers were built. Over 200 serious waterlogged areas in the urban area were solved, and 15 large and small stinking open ditches such as Dragon Beard Ditch and Li Guang Bridge were eliminated. Eight larger stagnant ponds such as Taiping Lake, East and West Pig Camps, Artillery Bureau, and North Official Hall were filled. Therefore, the severe situation in the northern Sijia Pit of Xuanwu District and the Elephant Nose Pit of Dongdan District, where water accumulated for half a month after rain in the summer, is no longer seen. The People's Government also dredged the Jin River, Chang River, Moat, Lotus River, and the lower reaches of the South Dry River, and built the Three Seas, Jishuitan, Shichahai, Taoranting, and Longtan, and built embankments for the various seas in the city. The previously silted rivers are now unobstructed, and the previously turbid Longtan and Taoranting have now become good places for the working people to visit.

In the past three years, Beijing has cleared about three million cubic meters of garbage, equivalent to three Jingshan Parks. In order to solve the difficulty of sewage disposal for citizens, the People's Government has also built 403 sewage ponds and 781 infiltration wells. All these sanitation constructions have played a great role in improving the environmental hygiene of the citizens.

With the development of Beijing's municipal construction, the construction plan of the Beijing Municipal People's Government's sanitation projects is also growing larger and larger. This year's total estimated budget is 233.9 billion yuan, which is equivalent to the sum of the past three years. According to this plan, 86 kilometers of sewers will be built this year, 21 new pipe trenches will be built, 35 existing sewers will be renovated, and 900,000 cubic meters of garbage will be cleared. In order to increase the water storage capacity of rivers and lakes for urban water use and to build new scenic spots, a huge project to return abandoned fields to lakes is currently underway in Zizhuyuan, in the western suburbs of the capital. The area of this lake is more than 100,000 square meters. At present, this project has been completed more than 90%, and it will be completed soon. In order to relieve the threat of floods in the capital, the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Hebei Provincial People's Government are actively preparing to dredge the main and tributary streams of the Liangshui River, with a total length of 73.3 kilometers, requiring a total of more than 1.9 million cubic meters of earthwork. This project is expected to officially start this autumn.

    大力改善市民环境卫生
    北京今年卫生工程投资大大增加
    北京市人民政府在最近三年多来进行了有计划的卫生建设工作。从一九五○年到一九五二年的三年中共计掏挖和整修了二百七十五公里的下水道，并新建了下水道九十七点四公里。在城区解决了严重的积水区二百余处，消除了龙须沟、李广桥等处大小十五条又脏又臭的明沟，填平了太平湖、东西猪营、炮局子、北官厅等八条较大的死水坑。因此像过去宣武区北部司家坑、东单区象鼻坑等在夏季雨后积水半月之久的严重情况已不再见了。人民政府又疏通了金河、长河、护城河、莲花河和南旱河的下游，修建了三海、积水潭、什刹海、陶然亭和龙潭，并将城内各海修建了护岸，从前淤塞的河道已经畅通无阻了，从前污浊的龙潭和陶然亭现在也已经成为劳动人民游览的好地方。
    北京市在过去三年中，共计清除了垃圾堆约三百万公方，相当于三个景山大；为了解决市民排除污水的困难，人民政府还修建了四百零三座污水池和七百八十一座渗水井，所有这些卫生建设，对改进市民环境卫生均起了很大的作用。
    随着北京市政建设的发展，北京市人民政府卫生工程的建设计划也越来越大。今年工程总概算为二千三百三十九亿元，这个数字相当于过去三年的总和。按照这个计划，今年要修建下水道八十六公里，新建管沟二十一处，整修旧有下水道三十五处，清除垃圾九十万方。为了增加河湖蓄水量以供城内用水和建设新的风景区，目前在首都西郊的紫竹院，正在进行一个巨大的废田还湖工程。这个湖的面积为十万余平方公尺。现在，这个工程已经完成了百分之九十以上，不久即可完工。为了解除首都洪水的威胁，目前北京市人民政府和河北省人民政府正积极筹备疏通凉水河的主流和支流，共长七十三点三公里，共需挖土方一百九十多万方。这一工程预计在今年秋季正式动工。
