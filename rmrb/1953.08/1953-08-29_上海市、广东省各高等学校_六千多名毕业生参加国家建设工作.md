Alongside the graduates from universities in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places who have taken up construction posts, more than 6,200 graduates from universities in Shanghai and Guangdong have also successively left school to participate in national construction work.

　　There are more than 4,700 graduates from Shanghai universities this summer, a large part of whom have been assigned to factories, mines, and basic construction departments to work on design, construction, and production; some have also been assigned to universities as teaching assistants and graduate students, and to secondary schools as teachers; many others have been assigned to work in state organs, hospitals, local state-owned enterprises, and private enterprises. Wu Wenhou, a graduate of the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing at Jiaotong University, was assigned to work in Taiyuan and felt very excited. He said, "Our motherland is constantly advancing, and now the heavy responsibility of the Five-Year Construction Plan rests on our shoulders. I will never fail the expectations of the motherland." Xu Chaomei, a graduate of the Department of Education at East China Normal University, said, "Although I have just left school, I have the confidence to train myself in my work and become an excellent people's teacher!" Many graduates expressed that they would humbly learn in their work, serve the working people wholeheartedly, and contribute more to the motherland. Before the departure of graduates from Jiaotong University, Fudan University, East China Normal University, East China Institute of Textile Technology, and other schools, the East China Administrative Council, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and various universities jointly held warm send-off rallies.

　　More than 1,500 graduates from Guangdong universities gathered in Guangzhou for study from August 17 to 24 before being assigned to work, and listened to reports on issues such as the great construction of the motherland. After studying, the graduating students expressed their determination and requested to go to the work posts where the motherland needs them most. Guo Hanshuo, a graduate of the South China Institute of Technology, was assigned to work at Anshan Iron and Steel Company. He said excitedly, "I will definitely put my greatest efforts into the hot construction of the motherland!" Li Shuhai, a graduate of the South China Institute of Technology who was also assigned to work at Angang, also drew up a work plan. He plans to start with small and ordinary practical work after arriving at his work post, learn from the workers, and make himself a skilled technician. Liu Genyuan, a graduate of the South China Medical College and a member of the Communist Youth League who was assigned to work in Tibet, wrote in his letter of determination: "Going to Tibet is an arduous but glorious task. I am determined to overcome all difficulties and not fail the motherland's expectations of a member of the Communist Youth League." (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海市、广东省各高等学校
    六千多名毕业生参加国家建设工作
    与京、津等地高等学校毕业生走上建设岗位的同时，上海市和广东省各高等学校毕业生六千二百多人也已陆续离开学校参加国家建设工作。
    上海各高等学校今年暑期毕业生有四千七百多人，其中很大一部分被分配到工厂、矿山和基本建设部门担任设计、施工和生产工作；也有一部分分配到高等学校作助教、研究生和分配到中等学校作教师；还有许多人分配到国家机关、医院、地方国营企业和私营企业中去工作。交通大学机械制造系毕业生吴文侯被分配到太原去工作，他感到很兴奋。他说：“祖国在不断地前进，现在五年建设的重任已落在我们的身上，我决不辜负祖国的期望。”华东师范大学教育系毕业生徐超眉说：“虽然我刚走出校门，但我有信心在工作中锻炼自己，成为一个优秀的人民教师！”许多毕业生表示：要虚心地在工作中学习，全心全意为劳动人民服务，为祖国贡献更多的力量。交通大学、复旦大学、华东师范大学、华东纺织工学院等校毕业生临行前，华东行政委员会、上海市人民政府和各高等学校联合举行了热烈的欢送大会。
    广东省各高等学校毕业生一千五百多名在分配工作前，从八月十七日到二十四日在广州市集中学习，听了有关祖国大建设等问题的报告。毕业学生们经过学习后，纷纷表示决心，要求到祖国最需要的工作岗位上去。华南工学院毕业生郭汉硕被分配到鞍山钢铁公司工作，他激动地说：“我一定拿出我最大的努力，投入祖国火热的建设中去！”被分配到鞍钢工作的华南工学院毕业生黎淑海还订出了工作计划，他准备到工作岗位后从细小、平凡的实际工作做起，向工人学习，使自己成为一个熟练的技术人员。被分配到西藏工作的华南医学院毕业生、青年团员刘根源在决心书上写道：“到西藏去是一个艰苦而光荣的工作，我决心克服一切困难，不辜负祖国对一个青年团员的期望。”（新华社）
