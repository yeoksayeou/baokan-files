    People's Representatives Go Deep into the Electorate to Collect Proposals
    The twelve people's representatives elected from the six electoral districts of Dongyuan Street, Dongfujia District, Harbin City, are actively fulfilling their glorious responsibilities by going deep among the electorate to collect proposals for the District People's Congress.
    After being elected, these people's representatives felt immensely honored. They unanimously expressed their intention to serve the people wholeheartedly, to convey the opinions of the electorate to the government, to transmit the government's opinions to the masses, and to lead the masses in taking on the responsibility of building the motherland. Currently, these representatives are collecting proposals for the District People's Congress. After being elected as a people's representative, Mi Wancheng, a family member of a military personnel, specifically convened a forum with the electorate to solicit their requests and suggestions for the People's Government and explained to the electorate the significance of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, reminding them to heighten their vigilance. Wang Shouyun, an elderly representative of sixty-two years old, mobilized residents to repair a pedestrian bridge and collected various suggestions from the electorate regarding municipal construction. People's Representative Liu Xingshu (craftsman) learned that street residents and craftsmen had an urgent need to study culture, so he volunteered to serve as a cultural instructor and prepared to propose the establishment of a cultural school at the District People's Congress. At the same time, many voters also reflected their opinions to the people's representatives and made requests to the People's Government. The women of Dongyuan Street unanimously suggested to Representative Chen Yaqin that women's literacy classes and kindergartens be opened among the street residents. Chen Yaqin is preparing to formally submit this suggestion as a proposal at the District People's Congress. (Xinhua News Agency)
