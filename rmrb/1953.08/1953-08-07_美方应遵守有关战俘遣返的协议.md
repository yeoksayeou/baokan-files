Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 6th: The work of repatriating prisoners of war by both opposing sides in Korea began on August 5th at Panmunjom.

    According to the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" signed by both parties on June 8, 1953, and the Armistice Agreement and its Provisional Supplementary Agreement signed by both parties on July 27, 1953: All prisoners of war held by both sides who insist on repatriation should be completely repatriated within two months after the armistice agreement comes into effect, without any obstruction. The remaining prisoners of war should be released to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to seek a fair solution to their repatriation issue.

    On July 22 this year, the Korean-Chinese side notified the United Nations Command of the total number of prisoners of war currently held, totaling more than 12,000, including more than 8,000 Koreans, more than 3,000 Americans, more than 900 British, and more than 300 other French, Turkish, Australian, Filipino, Canadian, Colombian, South African, Greek, Belgian, and Japanese prisoners of war. Since the Korean-Chinese side has never conducted so-called "screening" among the prisoners of war it holds, it did not distinguish between prisoners of war for direct repatriation and those for non-direct repatriation when it presented the overall number of more than 12,000 prisoners of war it currently held on July 22 this year. After the Korean-Chinese side announced the agreement on prisoners of war between the two sides to all the prisoners of war it held, if any prisoner of war was unwilling to be directly repatriated, the Korean-Chinese side would, in accordance with the Provisional Supplementary Agreement to the Armistice Agreement, notify the United Nations Command of the relevant figures as soon as possible. The above-mentioned more than 12,000 prisoners of war, plus the more than 680 sick and wounded prisoners of war who had already been directly repatriated by the Korean-Chinese side in April and May this year, mean that the total number of prisoners of war held by the Korean-Chinese side as of July 22 this year has exceeded 13,000. Compared with the list of more than 11,000 prisoners of war that the Korean-Chinese side presented on December 18, 1951, the number has increased by about 2,000. This indicates that the Korean-Chinese side has held a new batch of prisoners of war in the past year or so, and these new prisoners of war, like other prisoners of war already held by the Korean-Chinese side, will all enjoy the right to be repatriated.

    On the other hand, the United Nations Command presented the overall number of 74,000 prisoners of war to be directly repatriated on July 21 this year. Among them, 69,000 were captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and 5,000 were captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This overall number is obviously extremely unreasonable and contradicts the overall number it has presented in the past.

    According to the United Nations Command's clear statement on July 13, 1952, it notified the immediate direct repatriation of 83,000 prisoners of war after the armistice. In April and May this year, the United Nations Command repatriated more than 6,600 sick and wounded prisoners of war. Therefore, even without calculating the new prisoners of war held by the United Nations Command in the past year or so, the prisoners of war it should directly repatriate this time should be at least more than 76,000. In fact, in his letter to Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai on May 27 this year, General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, also clearly put forward the figure of 76,000 of our captured personnel who would be directly repatriated. However, in his letter to Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai on June 29 this year, Clark suddenly reduced the number of our captured personnel who would be directly repatriated to 74,000. In the short period of about a month, the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command has unreasonably reduced the number of prisoners of war for direct repatriation that he personally put forward by 2,000. In the armistice negotiations, the Korean-Chinese side has solemnly pointed out that the figure of 74,000 prisoners of war for direct repatriation presented by the other side obviously does not include the new prisoners of war it has held in the past year or so, and on the contrary shows an incomprehensible difference of 2,000. The United Nations Command bears the unavoidable responsibility of making a clear explanation on this.

    Regarding the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war of the Korean-Chinese side who should be released to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, the United Nations Command presented a figure of 22,300. Among them, 7,800 are from the Korean People's Army and 14,500 are from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. This figure obviously does not include the more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese captured personnel who were forcibly detained by Syngman Rhee. Although the United Nations Command has repeatedly stated that it will continue to make efforts to recover these forcibly detained captured personnel of our side, it has not taken any practical measures in this regard. In the statement issued by General Nam Il on July 19 this year, the Korean-Chinese side solemnly pointed out that the United Nations Command bears the responsibility at all times to recover all these prisoners of war and release them to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and make a clear explanation to the Korean-Chinese side, and declared in the negotiations that it reserves the right to raise this issue at a higher-level political conference between the two sides.

    Regarding the remaining non-directly repatriated Korean-Chinese captured personnel, the United Nations Command has stated that it guarantees that they will all be sent to designated locations in the southern half of the demilitarized zone and released to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody, to which the Korean-Chinese side has expressed its agreement. But at the same time, it solemnly stated:

    (1) The Korean-Chinese side will never recognize the Syngman Rhee government's statement that personnel from India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, armed forces from India and the Indian Red Cross, as well as the Korean-Chinese side's interpretation representatives, are not allowed to enter the South Korean region in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement. The Korean-Chinese side has notified the five neutral countries of India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Sweden that in the work of guarding non-directly repatriated prisoners of war, their representatives and personnel have the right to pass through South Korea and have the right to be protected by the United Nations Command, including the South Korean army.

    (2) The non-directly repatriated prisoners of war sent by the United Nations Command to the southern half of the demilitarized zone for custody by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission must be genuine prisoners of war. Special agents sent by Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek must not impersonate prisoner of war camp administrators, teachers, translators, or other personnel to follow the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to the demilitarized zone.

    (3) In the southern half of the demilitarized zone, the security and order around the locations designated by the United Nations Command for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to guard non-directly repatriated prisoners of war, with the exception of the part under the responsibility of the Indian armed forces, should be maintained by the civil police of the United Nations Command in the southern half of the demilitarized zone in accordance with the Armistice Agreement to prevent any actions that interfere with the locations for guarding prisoners of war.

    The Armistice Agreement and its annexes and provisional supplementary agreements have all come into effect. For the United Nations Command, whether it can adapt to abiding by the agreement between the two sides on the repatriation of prisoners of war will be one of the serious tests it must undergo in front of the people of the world.

### 美方应遵守有关战俘遣返的协议

    美方应遵守有关战俘遣返的协议
    【新华社开城六日电】朝鲜敌对双方遣返战俘的工作已于八月五日在板门店开始。
    根据一九五三年六月八日双方所签订的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和一九五三年七月二十七日双方所签订的停战协定及其临时补充协议之规定：双方收容下的一切坚持遣返的战俘应于停战协定生效后两个月内全部遣返完毕，不得加以任何阻难，其余战俘则全部释交中立国遣返委员会，以求得对他们遣返问题的公正解决。
    今年七月二十二日，朝中方面已将其现所收容的战俘概数通知联合国军方面，计一万二千余名，其中朝鲜籍八千余名，美籍三千余名，英籍九百余名，其他法籍、土耳其籍、澳大利亚籍、菲律宾籍、加拿大籍、哥伦比亚籍、南非籍、希腊籍、比利时籍、日本籍战俘共三百余名。由于朝中方面从未在它所收容的战俘中进行所谓“甄别”，因此它在今年七月二十二日提出它现所收容的一万二千余名战俘概数时，并未区分直接遣返与不直接遣返的战俘。当朝中方面将双方关于战俘的协议向它所收容的全部战俘宣布之后，如有任何战俘不愿直接遣返者，则朝中方面将按照停战协定的临时补充协议，尽速将有关数字通知联合国军方面。上述一万二千余名战俘，加上朝中方面今年四、五月间已直接遣返的六百八十余名病伤战俘，则截至今年七月二十二日为止，朝中方面所收容的战俘总数已超过一万三千名。较之朝中方面在一九五一年十二月十八日所提出的它当时收容的全部战俘名单一万一千余名，增加了二千名左右。这表示朝中方面一年多来又收容了一批新战俘，而这些新战俘和朝中方面所早已收容的其他战俘一样，都将享有被遣返的权利。
    而在联合国军方面，它于今年七月二十一日所提出的应直接遣返之战俘的概数是七万四千名。其中朝鲜人民军被俘人员六万九千名，中国人民志愿军被俘人员五千名。这一概数显然极不合理并和它过去所提出的概数相矛盾。
    按联合国军方面在一九五二年七月十三日曾明白表示，它通知于停战后立即直接遣返八万三千名战俘。今年四、五月间联合国军方面遣返了六千六百余名病伤战俘。因此，即使不计算联合国军在一年多以来所收容的新战俘，它此次应予直接遣返的战俘也至少应在七万六千名以上。事实上联合国军总司令克拉克今年五月二十七日给金日成元帅和彭德怀将军的信中，也曾明白提出了七万六千名将予直接遣返的我方被俘人员的数字。但克拉克在今年六月二十九日给金日成元帅与彭德怀将军的信中，却将直接遣返的我方被俘人员的数字，骤然降低为七万四千人。在短短的一个月左右的时间内，联合国军总司令竟然将他所亲自提出的直接遣返之战俘的数字毫无理由地减少了二千名。在停战谈判中，朝中方面已郑重指出，对方所提出的七万四千名直接遣返的战俘数字，显然没有包括它一年多来所收容的新战俘在内，而相反地显示了不可理解的二千名的差额。对此，联合国军方面负有作出明确交代的不可逃避的责任。
    对于按照停战协定联合国军应释交中立国遣返委员会接管的不直接遣返的战俘，联合国军方面提出了二万二千三百人的数字。其中朝鲜人民军七千八百人，中国人民志愿军一万四千五百人。这一数字显然并未包括被李承晚所强迫扣留的二万七千余名朝、中被俘人员。联合国军方面虽曾一再表示它将继续努力追回这些被强迫扣留的我方被俘人员，但事实上并未对此采取任何实际措施，朝中方面在今年七月十九日南日大将所发表的声明中，曾严正指出：联合国军方面在任何时候都负有将这些战俘全部追回释交中立国遣返委员会并向朝中方面作出明确交代的责任，并在谈判中声明保留权利在双方高一级的政治会议中提出这一问题。
    对于剩余的不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员，联合国军方面曾声明保证他们将全部被送至非军事区南半部的指定地点，释交中立国遣返委员会看管，朝中方面对此表示同意。但同时严正声明：
    （一）朝中方面绝不承认李承晚政府所谓不允许印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克人员、印度武装部队与印度红十字会人员以及朝中方面的解释代表根据停战协定的规定进入南朝鲜地区的声明，朝中方面已通知印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞士、瑞典五个中立国家在看管不直接遣返的战俘之工作上，他们的代表和人员有权通过南朝鲜并有权受到联合国军包括南朝鲜军在内的保护。
    （二）联合国军方面送至非军事区南半部释交中立国遣返委员会看管的不直接遣返的战俘，必须是真正的战俘，凡李承晚，蒋介石所派特务，均不得冒充战俘营管理员、教员、翻译或其他人员跟随不直接遣返的战俘来到非军事区。
    （三）在非军事区南半部，联合国军方面指定由中立国遣返委员会看管不直接遣返的战俘之地点，除由印度的武装力量负责的部分外，其周围的治安与秩序，应按照停战协定，由非军事区南半部联合国军方面的民政警察负责维持，防止任何对看管战俘地点的干扰的行动。
    停战协定及其附件与临时补充协议均已生效，对于联合国军方面来说，是否适应遵守双方有关战俘遣返的协议，将是它在全世界人民面前所必须经受的严重考验之一。
