The Northwest Administrative Committee issued the "Provisional Measures for the Formulation and Approval of Investigation and Statistical Reports by Government Agencies at All Levels in the Northwest Region" and the "Report on Checking the Situation of Randomly Issued Reports and Future Cleanup Opinions" from the Committee's Statistics Bureau, instructing all subordinate government agencies, enterprises, and organizations to conscientiously check and clean up reports. The directive stated: People's governments above the county level should, in accordance with the two issued documents, conduct inspections of their department's report statistics work and conscientiously clean up all current statistical reports. When departments and Greater Administrative Region agencies conduct inspections, they should not only limit themselves to formally issued statistical reports, but also pay attention to disguised statistical reports such as arrangements at meetings, regulations in plans, and requests for material figures from lower levels via telegrams and telephones. Each report-issuing agency should list all current reports or investigation plans it has issued, propose cleanup opinions, and submit them to the Statistics Bureau for review and processing. Those that should be abolished should be immediately notified for abolition; those that need to be revised or continue to be filled out should seek the opinions of the filling-out agencies below, preferably using typical investigation methods. As for the cleanup work of provinces, cities, special districts, and counties, the provincial and municipal governments should specifically study and decide, preferably referring to the methods of the Greater Administrative Region, first conducting key inspections to gain specific experience, and then requiring departments in provinces and cities to conduct inspections and cleanup in conjunction with anti-bureaucracy, and then determining the time, methods, and steps for special districts and counties to conduct inspections and cleanup based on the specific situation. It is also required that the people's governments of each province and city report the inspection and cleanup results to the Northwest Administrative Committee.

The Xi'an Masses Daily published an editorial titled "Overcoming Bureaucracy and Decentralism in Statistical Work." The editorial stated: The most fundamental reason for the current chaotic situation of rural statistical reports is: First, many Party and government leading organs, especially those above the county level, have serious bureaucratic work styles. When issuing statistical reports, they do not consider actual needs and possibilities, but blindly demand many statistical materials from below based solely on their subjective assumptions, and the content is complex and the time limit is short. As a result of layer-by-layer forwarding, when concentrated in districts and townships, a situation of flying forms and inability to cope is formed, which seriously affects the work of district and township cadres in concentrating their efforts on leading production. Many reports sent to rural areas do not take into account the actual situation in rural areas at all. In order to complete tasks and cope with superiors, district and township cadres have to resort to estimation, inference, and finger-guessing methods to fabricate some figures. This is one of the important roots of the "false reports," which our country fundamentally does not allow. The result of recklessly fabricating figures also exacerbates the chaos of statistical work. Second, some leading organs and business departments have serious decentralism. There are many organizations, many tasks, and everything requires "tabularization," and they do not contact each other, communicate vertically, and each emphasizes importance. Some business departments issue many investigation forms to lower levels without review and approval from the Party and government leaders. Some forms are even issued to lower levels by general staff members without review by the responsible personnel of the department, and even if they are reviewed, some responsible persons do not conduct strict reviews and treat the authority of review and approval as a "routine matter." The result of such reckless approval has caused serious duplication and waste of statistical reports. Even more than half of the forms are duplicated, which further aggravates the busy work of districts and townships. This phenomenon also reflects that some Party committees do not strictly supervise the current central work politically, do not control it organizationally, and do not recognize the seriousness of the situation caused by the chaos of statistical reports affecting the busyness of cadres below, or even turn a blind eye. In addition, the desire for greatness and novelty of individual departments and some leaders also contributes to the current abuse and duplication of statistical reports.

In order to correct the current chaotic phenomenon in rural statistical work, the editorial pointed out: Overcoming bureaucracy and decentralism in leading organs, especially those above the county level, is the only way to fundamentally solve this problem. At the same time, combining top-down control with bottom-up supervision can effectively resist the prevalence of bureaucracy and decentralism in statistical reports.

The editorial finally pointed out: In the future, leading organs in various regions should strengthen political supervision and organizational control over statistical work, and pay attention to accumulating experience in statistical work, giving play to enthusiasm and creativity, and improving statistical work organizations, so as to gradually establish practical and feasible statistical work.

    西北行政委员会指示所属
    切实检查清理所发统计报表
    西北行政委员会颁发了“西北区各级政府机关制订及审批调查统计报表暂行办法”和该会统计局“关于检查乱发报表情况及今后清理意见的报告”，指示所属各级政府机关、企业、团体切实检查清理报表。指示说：县以上人民政府，应根据颁发的两个文件，对于本部门的报表统计工作，加以检查，对于所有现行的统计报表切实加以清理。各部门和大区机关检查时不仅限于正式制发的统计报表一个方面，还要注意检查会议上的布置、计划中的规定以及电报、电话上向下边索取材料数字等变相的统计报表。每个制发报表机关，均应将自己所发的现行报表或调查方案，逐一开列清单，提出清理意见，经由统计局审核后，分别加以处理。应废止者，立即通知废止；需要修改或继续填报者，应征求下面填报机关的意见，最好采取典型调查方法进行。至于各省、市、专、县的清理工作，应由省、市政府具体研究决定，最好参照大区的方法，首先进行重点检查，取得具体经验，再要求省、市各部门结合反官僚主义进行检查和清理，然后根据具体情况，确定专区和县进行检查清理的时间、方法和步骤。并要求各省、市人民政府将检查清理结果报告西北行政委员会。西安群众日报对此发表了题为“克服统计工作中的官僚主义和分散主义”的社论。社论说：农村统计报表之所以造成今天这样的混乱局面，最根本的原因是：第一，许多党政领导机关特别是县以上的领导机关存在着严重的官僚主义作风。他们在颁发统计报表时，毫不估计到实际需要与可能，只凭自己的主观臆想，盲目地向下索要许多统计资料，而且内容繁杂，限时短促，加之层层照转的结果，集中到区、乡时，形成表格纷飞，无法应付的现象，严重地影响了区乡干部集中力量领导生产的工作。有许多发往农村的报表，更完全不估计到农村的实际情况，区乡干部为着完成任务，应付上级，也只好采取估计推算、掏指头的办法，捏造一些数目字，这就是产生“假报告”的重要根源之一，这是我们国家根本所不允许的。胡乱捏造数字的结果，同时更助长了统计工作的混乱。第二，某些领导机关和业务部门存在着严重的分散主义。组织多、任务多，样样要求“表格化”，彼此又互不联系，垂直行文，各自强调重要。有些业务部门不经党、政领导审查批准，擅自向下颁发许多调查表格，甚至有的表格不经本部门负责人员审查，仅由一般工作人员擅自向下颁发，有些即使经过审查，也由于有些负责人审查不严，把审查批准的权限当作“例行公事”。这样胡乱批发的结果，就造成统计报表严重的重复浪费现象，甚至有半数以上的表格是重复的，这就更加重了区乡工作的忙乱。这一现象，也正反映了有些党委对当前中心工作，在政治上监督不严，组织上控制不周，对由于统计报表混乱影响下边干部忙乱的情况认识不足，甚至是熟视无睹，感不到问题的严重性。此外，个别部门和有的领导者好大喜功，标新立异，也更助长了目前统计报表的滥发与重复混乱的情况。为了纠正目前农村统计工作中的混乱现象，社论指出：要克服领导机关特别是县以上领导机关中的官僚主义和分散主义，才能从根本上解决这一问题。同时要把自上而下的控制与自下而上的监督相结合，才能有效地抵制统计报表中官僚主义、分散主义的流行。社论最后指出：各地领导机关对统计工作，今后要加强政治上的监督，组织上的控制，并注意积累统计工作的经验，发挥积极性和创造性，健全统计工作机构，以逐步建立起实用的可行的统计工作。
