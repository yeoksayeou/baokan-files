To the respected Chairman Mao:
Under the glorious illumination of your great ethnic policy, for the past three years, the 400,000 people of nine ethnic groups in the Dehong region of Yunnan Province have united as one, smashed the conspiracies of the remnants of the imperialist Chiang Kai-shek bandits, stabilized social order in the border region, carried out ethnic democratic construction, and launched a patriotic production increase campaign. This has greatly enhanced the political consciousness of all ethnic groups, improved their living standards, and made it possible for us to convene here today the first People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region, an event of great significance in the political life of all ethnic groups and unprecedented in history. We are establishing our autonomous region and autonomous organs, and exercising our autonomous rights as masters of our own affairs. In an atmosphere of unity and friendship, all representatives fully demonstrated the spirit of mutual respect and concession, solemnly signed the Unity and Patriotism Covenant, and ended the old hatreds and grudges left over from history, laying a solid political foundation for us to jointly enjoy a free, equal, and happy life in the great family of the motherland.

Respected Chairman Mao, in these days of jubilation and universal celebration, we never forget your care and kindness towards the minority ethnic groups. Your name is the embodiment of our happiness and hope, and the banner of liberation for all ethnic groups. We hereby guarantee to you that in the future, under your wise leadership, we will closely connect with the broad masses of all ethnic groups, strengthen unity and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups, more actively seek the help of the Han elder brother, and fully exert our political enthusiasm and patriotism to strive for the vigorous development of production, strengthening the struggle against the enemy, and consolidating national defense.

The First People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region, Yunnan Province
July 24, 1953
