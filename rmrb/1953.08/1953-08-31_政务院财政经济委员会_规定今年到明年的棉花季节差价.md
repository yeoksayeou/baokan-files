The Government Administrative Council's Financial and Economic Committee
Stipulates Seasonal Price Differences for Cotton from This Year to Next Year

New cotton is about to enter the market. In order to allow cotton farmers to sell cotton at their own pace and to rationally regulate the supply of autumn grain and industrial products to cotton farmers, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government has stipulated the seasonal price differences for cotton from 1953 to 1954, based on the cotton-grain price ratio set on April 1st of this year. The total range is set at about 9%, with increases in early November, mid-to-late December, and after the Spring Festival: The price in early November will be 3.5% higher than the new cotton price in September, and there will be increases in mid-to-late December and after the Spring Festival, so that farmers who store cotton for delayed sale will not suffer losses and will even benefit slightly. To this end, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administrative Council has issued instructions: requiring all localities to conduct full publicity among farmers, so that farmers in cotton-producing areas, especially poor and middle peasants, fully understand this seasonal price difference method, delay selling cotton in steps, sell less first and then more later, which is beneficial to the country and themselves, and not be deceived or exploited by unscrupulous merchants and profiteers who suppress prices for purchases. The Central Ministry of Commerce has, in accordance with the spirit of this instruction from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administrative Council, stipulated the purchase prices of new cotton in early September and November 1st as follows:

    政务院财政经济委员会
    规定今年到明年的棉花季节差价
    【新华社三十日讯】新棉即将上市。中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会为使棉农可以从容出售棉花，对棉农合理调节秋粮与工业品的供应，特根据今年四月一日规定的棉粮比价，规定一九五三年到一九五四年的棉花季节差价。其总幅度定在百分之九左右，在十一月初旬、十二月中下旬和春节后分三次上提：十一月初比九月新棉价提高百分之三·五，到十二月中、下旬和春节后再各提一次，以便使存棉缓售的农民不致吃亏，并稍有利。为此，政务院财政经济委员会已发出指示：要求各地在农民中进行充分宣传，使棉产区农民，特别是贫农、中农充分了解此项季节差价办法，稍为推迟一些时间按步出售棉花，先少卖、后多卖，对国家、对自己都有利，不要受奸商及囤积牟利分子压价收购的欺骗、剥削。中央商业部已根据政务院财政经济委员会这一指示的精神，规定了九月初及十一月一日新棉收购价格如下：
