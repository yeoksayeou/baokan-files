A Corner of the Dongshan Island Battle
Li Weimin

Editor's Note: On the morning of July 16th at 5:00 AM, more than 10,000 remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandits entrenched in Taiwan and Kinmen Islands, under the cover of airplanes and warships and with the cooperation of paratroopers, invaded Dongshan Island, Fujian. The People's Liberation Army, alertly guarding the motherland's coast, with the assistance of the island's militia and masses, dealt a heavy blow to the landing bandits. The battle ended victoriously at 7:00 PM the next day, eliminating more than 3,300 remnant bandits. This dispatch describes a fragment of this battle.

In the deep of night on July 15th, an emergency meeting was held in the company headquarters of the Second Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, alertly guarding Dongshan Island, Fujian. "...That's the situation. Immediately enter the positions and prepare for battle." Company Commander Zheng Dexiu ended the meeting with a brief order.

The villages on the motherland's island were still very quiet. The soldiers, with skillful and agile movements, quickly entered Highland 200. Commander Zhou meticulously checked the deployment of forces and the arrangement of firepower. The soldiers once again wiped the weapons that were always kept clean. Everyone was full of confidence in victory, ready to fiercely annihilate the remnant bandits who dared to intrude.

At five o'clock in the morning on the 16th, more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops rushed towards Highland 200, and a fierce battle began. The commanders and fighters of the Second Company received the regimental commander's order: "Hold Highland 200, pin the enemy down in front of the highland, and wait for the brotherly troops to come up and encircle and annihilate them!" This was a glorious and arduous task, and Company Commander Zheng Dexiu's resolute voice answered the regimental commander: "Rest assured, Commander!"

From 9:00 AM onwards, the enemy, under the cover of artillery fire, launched continuous attacks on Highland 200. When the enemy approached the Second Company's position, they were suddenly met with fierce shooting and hand grenades from the soldiers. Before the enemy could fight back, they rolled down the mountain, dead and alive. Later, several enemy charges were also crushed.

The Sixth Squad's position was on the mountainside to the left of the west side of Highland 200, the most intensely fought place. The enemy's repeated charges here almost never stopped. In the tense battle, Deputy Squad Leader Jiang Shunzhen was wounded. Soldier Wang Wangyan took over the deputy squad leader's machine gun and swept down the enemies who had climbed up. The gun barrel became scalding hot, so he took off his shoes and used them as padding while firing. In the afternoon, Wang Wangyan was also wounded, a bullet piercing his waist. But he knew that now the comrades of the Sixth Squad were holding off more than a dozen enemies each, and one less person meant one less defense force. He bandaged his wound and continued to fight bravely. The warriors of the Sixth Squad repelled the enemy's charges time and time again, killing and wounding the enemy in large numbers. At this time, an exciting news quickly spread on the position. "The brotherly troops fought beautifully, and the enemy paratroopers were annihilated by us as soon as they landed!" The soldiers joyfully assured each other: We must also pin the enemy here and annihilate them completely in the end!

At dusk, the battle became more intense. The traffic trenches around the highland were occupied by the enemy. Cannon smoke billowed on the hilltop, and the enemy, taking advantage of the smoke, climbed up the mountain from the front and from the rear. The soldiers knew that persisting to the end meant victory. They used every bit of time to continuously collect bullets from the enemy's corpses, pulled the safety pins of the 60mm mortar shells to use as hand grenades, and the wounded comrades continued to fight. The cultural instructor and the cooks also came to join the battle. In front of the heroes of the Second Company, the enemy was still beaten bloody and collapsed. At this time, the Twelfth Company of a certain unit of the brotherly troops quickly arrived, and the artillery platoon transferred from the regimental headquarters also arrived at the Second Company's position, greatly boosting the confidence of the Second Company's commanders and fighters in victory, and greatly strengthened the strength of defending Highland 200.

The enemy's several desperate attacks that night were also repelled. The heroic Highland 200 was truly like an indomitable bronze wall, preventing the frenzied enemy from advancing even one step.

On the morning of the 17th, the sun shone on the heroic Highland 200. After a day and a night of battle, the heroic soldiers, regardless of hunger, thirst, and fatigue, were now excitedly and nervously preparing for the counterattack. The moment to annihilate the enemy was about to arrive.

"The brotherly troops are here!" The counterattack began, and the heroic Highland 200 was seething. The heroes who had persevered to victory cheered enthusiastically. They saw the powerful brotherly troops rapidly cutting into the enemy's depth from both sides of Highland 200. The enemy's position was in chaos. They immediately used their prepared firepower to cover the brotherly troops in encircling and annihilating the routed enemy.

On this day, the victorious soldiers saw a long line of captured Chiang Kai-shek troops passing by the foot of Highland 200. The enemy planes, dragging black tails, plunged into the sea, and the enemy warships fled in panic. The heroes who defended the sacred coast of the motherland had won a complete victory.

After the battle, I came to the heroic Highland 200. The heroic People's Liberation Army soldiers were excitedly talking about the victory of the battle. Standing on the highland, they often looked enthusiastically at the motherland's mainland. They guarded here day and night, alertly, in order to defend the great and beloved motherland. If the enemy is still not reconciled, the soldiers will "welcome" them with even more severe blows!

    东山岛战斗一角
    李维民
    编者按：七月十六日上午五时，盘踞在台湾和金门岛的残余蒋匪拼凑了一万多人，在飞机、兵舰的掩护和伞兵的配合下窜犯福建东山岛。警惕地守卫祖国海防的人民解放军某部，在岛上民兵和群众的协助下，给予登陆残匪以沉重的打击，战斗在第二天下午七时胜利结束，共歼灭残匪三千三百余名。这篇通讯所写的就是这次战斗中的一个片断。
    七月十五日深夜，警惕地守卫在祖国福建东山岛上的人民解放军某部第二连的连部里，举行了紧急会议。“……情况就是这样。马上进入阵地，准备战斗。”连长郑德修用简短的命令，结束了会议。
    祖国海岛上的村庄依旧十分安静。战士们用熟练的轻捷的动作，迅速进入二○○高地，指挥员周密地检查了兵力的配备和布置的火力，战士们又一次擦拭始终保持着洁净的武器，大家满怀胜利信心，准备痛歼敢于前来窜犯的残余匪帮。
    十六日清晨五点钟，一千多蒋匪军冲向二○○高地来，激烈的战斗开始了。第二连的指战员们接到团长的命令：“坚守二○○高地，把敌人钉住在高地前面，等兄弟部队上来围歼！”这是光荣而艰巨的任务，回答团长的是连长郑德修的坚决的声音：“请首长放心！”
    从上午九点钟开始，敌人在炮火掩护下，向二○○高地进行连续不断的攻击。当敌人接近二连阵地的时候，突然遇到了战士们猛烈的射击和手榴弹。敌人没来得及还手，就连死带活的滚下山去。以后敌人几次冲锋也都被打垮了。
    二连六班的阵地在二○○高地西部左边的山腰间，是战斗最激烈的一个地方，敌人对这里的轮番冲锋几乎一直没有停息。在紧张的战斗中，副班长江顺珍负伤了，战士王旺炎接过副班长的机枪，把爬上来的敌人扫了下去。枪管打得烫手了，他脱下鞋子垫着打。下午，王旺炎也负伤了，子弹穿透了他的腰。但是他知道，现在六班的同志们，一个人顶着十几个敌人，少一个人就少一份守备力量，他包扎了伤口，英勇地继续战斗。六班的勇士们一次又一次的打退了敌人的冲锋，成批地杀伤了敌人。这时候，阵地上飞快地传播着一个令人兴奋的消息。“兄弟部队打得真漂亮，敌人伞兵一下就给我们歼灭啦！”战士们欢欣鼓舞地互相保证说：我们也一定把敌人钉在这里，最后歼灭它们！
    黄昏，战斗更加激烈起来，高地周围的交通壕被敌人占领了，山头上炮烟滚滚，敌人借着烟雾从正面和侧后爬上山来。战士们知道坚持到底，就是胜利，他们利用了点滴时间不断地从敌人死尸身上搜集子弹，把六○炮弹的保险针拔掉代替手榴弹，负伤的同志继续坚持作战，文化教员、炊事员也赶来参加战斗，敌人在二连英雄们面前依旧被打得头破血流，垮下去了。这时，兄弟部队某部十二连迅速赶到，团指挥所调来的火炮排也到达二连阵地，大大的鼓舞了二连指战员们的胜利信心，也大大加强了坚守二○○高地的力量。
    敌人当晚几次绝望的进攻，又被打退了。英雄的二○○高地，真像擎天的铜墙铁壁一样，使疯狂的敌人不能前进一步。
    十七日上午，太阳照耀着英雄的二○○高地，经过一天一夜战斗，英雄的战士们这时不顾饥渴和疲劳，正兴奋紧张地进行着反击的准备，歼灭敌人的时刻就要到了。
    “兄弟部队来啦！”反击开始了，英雄的二○○高地沸腾了，坚持到胜利的英雄们热烈欢呼，他们看见强大的兄弟部队从二○○高地两侧迅速插向敌人纵深，敌人的阵地混乱了，他们立即用自己准备好了的火力掩护兄弟部队围歼溃退的敌人。
    这一天，胜利的战士们看见一大串一大串被俘虏的蒋匪军从二○○高地山脚下走过，敌机拖着黑尾巴，一头栽倒大海里，敌舰慌慌张张地逃走了。保卫祖国神圣海防的英雄们完全胜利了。
    战斗结束以后，我来到了英雄的二○○高地。英雄的人民解放军战士们正在兴奋地谈着战斗的胜利。他们站在高地上经常热情地眺望着祖国大陆，他们就为了保卫伟大可爱的祖国，日日夜夜警惕地守卫在这里，如果敌人还不甘心，战士们将用更严重的打击“迎接”它们！
