    Jingxi Mining Bureau Tuoli Mine Must Correct Leadership Ideology and Improve Coal Quality
    Ma Xiaotian and Gong Shimin of the Mentougou Wholesale Station of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company wrote: After the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government issued instructions on improving the quality of coal production, the Tuoli Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau did not take effective measures to improve coal quality. On the contrary, the amount of gangue in the coal has been increasing day by day. On June 14, the mine delivered 1.8 tons of raw coal to our company, from which 72 jin of stones were picked out, with a stone content of 2%; on the 15th, 1 ton of pulverized coal was delivered, from which 109 jin of gangue were picked out, with a gangue content of 5.45%; on the 18th, 1.4 tons of pulverized coal was delivered, from which 173 jin of gangue were picked out, and the gangue content rose to 6.178%.
    The staff of the mine do not sufficiently understand the significance of improving coal quality. For example, once when we were weighing the coal, we found that the coal quality was particularly poor, and there were too many small stone chips in the coal, making it impossible for the workers to pick them out, so we raised our concerns with them. Zhang Yurong, the person in charge of Tuoli Mine, said that the coal quality was not bad and asked us to accept it in order to "take care of the interests of the entire mine." The mine also restricted workers to picking gangue only at the weighing location; when workers voluntarily went to the dump slope near the site to pick stones, Zhang Yurong stopped them. The mine often smashes many stone chips and intermediate rocks with coal on them and mixes them into the coal, reducing the quality of coal production. We have raised our concerns many times, but the mine only verbally promised "not to mix them anymore," but afterwards they still mixed the stone chips into the coal. Such erroneous behavior of the mine, which fails to implement the instructions of higher authorities and disregards overall interests, is very serious. The relevant leading organs such as the Jingxi Mining Bureau should strictly inspect their work and correct the erroneous leadership thinking of Zhang Yurong and others.

### 京西矿务局坨里矿必须端正领导思想提高煤质

    京西矿务局坨里矿必须端正领导思想提高煤质
    中国煤业建筑器材公司门头沟批发站马箫田、贡士民来信：中央人民政府燃料工业部发表了提高产煤质量的指示以后，京西矿务局坨里矿并未采取有效措施以改进煤质；相反地，煤中含矸石量却日益增加。六月十四日该矿交给我公司原煤一点八吨，拣出石头七十二斤，含石量为百分之二；十五日发来末煤一吨，拣出矸石一百零九斤，含石量达百分之五点四五；十八日发来末煤一点四吨，拣出矸石一百七十三斤，含石量上升至百分之六点一七八。
    该矿的工作人员对提高煤质的意义是认识不足的。例如有一次我们在收煤过磅时发现煤质特别低劣，煤内含小石片过多，工人无法挑拣，就向他们提出意见。坨里矿负责人张玉荣却说煤质并不次，要我们收下以“照顾全矿的利益”。该矿并限制工人只能在过磅的地点拣矸石；工人主动到现场附近的堆坡上拣石时，张玉荣却加以阻止。矿方经常把很多粘有煤的石片、二性石都砸碎掺在煤中，降低了产煤质量。我们曾多次提出意见，矿方只是口头答应“不再掺”，但过后还是把石片掺到煤里去。该矿这种不执行上级指示、不顾整体利益的错误行为是十分严重的。京西矿务局等有关领导机关应严格检查他们的工作，纠正张玉荣等错误的领导思想。
