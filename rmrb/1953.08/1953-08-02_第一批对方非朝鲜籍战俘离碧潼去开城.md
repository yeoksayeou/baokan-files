Xinhua News Agency, Pi-tong, August 1st: A convoy of vehicles carrying the first group of non-Korean POWs left Pi-tong at 10:30 this morning. This convoy will arrive at the Qing-shui-li railway station on the south bank of the Yalu River this afternoon. The POWs will take a train to Kaesong to await repatriation. They are expected to arrive in Kaesong on August 3rd, two days before the scheduled date for the exchange of prisoners, departing from this railway station, which is 50 kilometers northeast of Sinuiju.

The POWs were very happy when they learned they could depart by train. They said it would be faster and more comfortable this way. Some POWs were very surprised that the railway was still passable after years of bombing.

A cove near the POW camp (where the POWs often swam) became a very busy port at dawn today. Many boats and motorboats were waiting there, ready to ferry the repatriated POWs across the river to board the vehicles.

As the neatly dressed POWs boarded the boats with biscuits and canned food, everyone cheered and shook hands constantly. The POWs who had not yet left stood on the shore, waving goodbye to them. The POWs greeted each other loudly: "See you in London!" "Wait for me on the New York docks!" These POWs who boarded the boats shook hands tightly with every Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel and guard on the riverbank, thanking the Korean and Chinese people for their kindness. One guard said to a POW: "Peace is best!" The POW replied: "Peace—no more fighting between our people."

As the boats left the cove, some POWs began to play the harmonica, guitar, and other instruments, while the rest sang songs. British POWs sang: "Now is the time to say goodbye." A British POW said: "I am very happy to be able to go home, but it is also sad to leave." "I am happy that I can be with my wife and children again, but sad that I don't want to leave the people here who have done so much for us."

Among this group of POWs were non-Korean POWs who were seriously ill or wounded. Doctors and nurses did their best to make the journey safe and comfortable for these POWs. Yesterday, before the POWs left, they gave the POWs a thorough physical examination when they changed their bandages.

Dr. Wei, one of the best doctors at the general hospital here, was assigned to escort these POWs to Kaesong. As the POWs were sent to ambulances and trucks, doctors and nurses stayed by their side. They constantly asked how the patients were feeling, and gave them water and medicine if needed. They had a variety of medicines in their medicine bags. During this journey, very few patients rode in each vehicle.

    第一批对方非朝鲜籍战俘离碧潼去开城
    【新华社碧潼一日电】一队载着第一批非朝鲜籍战俘的汽车队在今天上午十时半离开碧潼。这一汽车队将在今天下午开到鸭绿江南岸青水里的火车站。战俘们将乘火车到开城去等候遣返。他们从这个在新义州东北五十公里的火车站乘车出发，可望在八月三日，即预定交换战俘日期的前两天抵达开城。
    当战俘们知道他们可以乘火车出发时，都非常高兴。他们说，这样比较快而且舒服。有些战俘对于经过几年的轰炸后铁路仍然可以通行，觉得非常惊奇。
    战俘营附近的一个河湾（战俘们常常在那边游泳），今天黎明成了一个非常热闹的港口。许多船只和汽艇等在那边，准备把遣返的战俘摆渡到河的对岸去乘汽车。
    当服装整洁的战俘们带着饼干和罐头食物上船的时候，大家不断欢呼和握手。还没有离开的战俘们站在岸上，向他们挥手道别。战俘们彼此高声招呼：“到伦敦再见！”“在纽约码头上等我吧！”这些上了船的战俘们和在河岸上的每一个中国人民志愿军人员和守卫人员紧紧握手，感谢朝中人民对他们的宽待。一个守卫人员对一个战俘说：“和平顶好！”战俘回答说：“和平——我们人民之间不再打仗了。”
    当船只离开河湾时，有些战俘就开始吹口琴、弹吉他和其他乐器，其余的人就唱起歌来。英国战俘们唱着：“现在这个时候到了。”一个英国战俘说：“我很高兴可以回家了，但分别的时候又觉得难受”。“高兴的是：我又可以和妻子、孩子在一起，难受的是：我不愿意离开这里的人，他们曾为我们做了那么多事情。”    
    在这一批战俘里面有非朝鲜籍的重病重伤的战俘。医生和护士们尽他们最大的努力，使这些战俘在旅途中安全而且舒适。昨天，在战俘们离开这里以前，他们替战俘更换绷带时，还进行了彻底的体格检查。
    魏大夫是这里总医院的最好的大夫之一，他被指派护送这些战俘到开城去。当战俘们被送到救护车和卡车上的时候，大夫和护士们一直守在他们身旁。他们时刻探问病人们感觉怎么样，如有需要，还给他们喝水吃药。在他们的药品袋内有各种各样的药品。在这次旅程中，每辆车上只乘很少的病人。
