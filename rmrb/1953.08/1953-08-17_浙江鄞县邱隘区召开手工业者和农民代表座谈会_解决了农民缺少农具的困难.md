Zhejiang Yinxian Qiuyi District Convenes Symposium of Handicraft Workers and Farmer Representatives
Resolves Farmers' Difficulties in Lacking Farm Tools

    In Qiuyi, Xinle, Dongya, and other three villages in Qiuyi District, Yinxian County, Zhejiang Province, farmers had not prepared tools such as rice baskets, bamboo mats, grain coverings, and rice buckets twenty days before the early rice harvest. Moreover, the actual number of harvesting tools needed this year was much higher than last year. This resulted in a serious situation where the supply of harvesting tools could not meet the demand. Some local handicraft workers thought that since the peak season had arrived and there were more jobs, they could take their time. Others produced shoddy goods, causing dissatisfaction among the farmers. In order to solve the farmers' difficulties in repairing and adding harvesting tools, and to ensure timely harvesting of early rice, the Yinxian Qiuyi District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Qiuyi District People's Government convened a symposium of handicraft workers and farmer representatives from the three villages on July 3.

    At the meeting, the district head reported on the importance of repairing and adding farm tools, the prospects for the development of handicrafts, and specific policies for handicrafts. Then the representatives conducted specific research. Everyone agreed that farmers needed to repair and add many farm tools, but there were few bamboo and rattan workers, and time was tight. Only by adopting the method of "mainly repairing old tools and appropriately making new ones" could they quickly help farmers overcome the difficulty of lacking farm tools. Therefore, it was decided to rationally divide the existing twenty-nine bamboo and rattan workers in the three villages, with twelve bamboo and rattan workers making new tools and seventeen bamboo and rattan workers repairing old ones.

    Next, the representatives studied ways to solve the difficulties of raw materials and funds. In order to reduce costs and alleviate the burden on farmers, the handicraft representatives proposed that raw materials should mainly be obtained locally. In addition to what they could purchase themselves, the remaining raw materials would be purchased uniformly by the local supply and marketing cooperative. If handicraft workers had financial difficulties, they could apply for appropriate loans from the People's Bank.

    Before the meeting, farmers complained about the high price of farm tools, the unreasonable wages for repairing old farm tools, and the poor quality of ironware. Handicraft workers complained that farmers did not provide work in the off-season, but insisted on getting work done during the peak season, which affected the unity between handicraft workers and farmers. At the meeting, representatives from both sides made self-criticisms and put forward suggestions for improvement. Farmer representative Dai Xintang suggested that ironworkers should make the sand-tipped knives thinner and the teeth finer and denser. Ironworker representative Wang Yuanli reviewed his past shortcomings in producing shoddy goods and promised to improve in the future. Bamboo and rattan worker representative Wan Yueming guaranteed that future products would meet specifications. Farmer representative Qiu Ahua said, "It's easy to handle everything if we speak our minds." In an atmosphere of consultation and unity, the handicraft worker representatives and farmer representatives, together with the supply and marketing cooperative, signed an agreement on wages, prices, specifications, and procurement of raw materials.

    After the meeting, the handicraft worker representatives and farmer representatives of Qiuyi District returned to their villages and conveyed the spirit of the meeting, mobilizing people to actively rush to repair farm tools. The farmers in the district also voluntarily consulted and distinguished between priorities and emergencies, first repairing the urgently needed farm tools. Therefore, the difficulty of the farmers in the district lacking farm tools for harvesting early rice has been basically resolved smoothly.

    浙江鄞县邱隘区召开手工业者和农民代表座谈会
    解决了农民缺少农具的困难
    浙江省鄞县邱隘区邱隘、新乐、东雅等三个乡的农民，在早稻收割期二十天前，还没有把稻箩、篾簟、遮粮、稻桶等工具准备好。而今年实际需要的收割工具数目又比去年要多得多。这就出现了收割工具供不应求的严重情况。当地有些手工业者以为旺季到了，活计多了，可以慢慢来；有的就粗制滥造，引起农民不满。为了解决农民修添收割工具的困难，保证及时收割早稻，中共鄞县邱隘区委和邱隘区人民政府于七月三日召开了三个乡的手工业者和农民代表座谈会。
    会上，区长报告了当前修添农具的重要，手工业的发展前途和对手工业的具体政策等问题。接着代表们就具体进行研究。大家认为农民要修添的农具多，篾工少，时间紧迫，只有采用“以修旧为主，适当造新”的办法，才能迅速地帮助农民克服缺少农具的困难。因此就决定将三个乡现有的二十九个篾竹工合理分工，十二个篾竹工去做新的，十七个篾竹工去修理旧的。
    接着，代表们又研究了解决原料和资金困难的办法。手工业代表们为了减低成本，减轻农民负担，提出了原料以就地取材为主，除自己能采办的外，其余都请当地供销合作社负责统一采办。手工业者资金有困难的，可向人民银行适当申请贷款。
    在开会前，农民嫌农具价格高，修理旧农具的工资不合理，嫌铁器的规格品质不好。手工业者埋怨农民淡季不做生活，旺季硬拉工，因此影响了手工业者与农民之间的团结。在会议上，双方代表都作了检查，并提出改进意见。农民代表戴信棠提议请铁业工人把沙尖刀打得薄些，齿要细些，密些。铁业代表王元利检讨自己过去粗制滥造的毛病，今后保证改进。篾竹工人代表万月明保证今后的产品合乎规格。农民代表邱阿华说：“有话讲在明处，什么事情都好办了。”在协商和团结的气氛中，手工业者和农民代表双方和供销合作社根据工资、价格、规格、采购原料等订立了协议书。
    邱隘区手工业者代表和农民代表在会后回村分别传达了会议精神，动员积极赶修农具。该区农民也自愿协商，分出主次缓急，先修急需的农具。因此，该区农民收割早稻缺少农具的困难已基本顺利解决。
