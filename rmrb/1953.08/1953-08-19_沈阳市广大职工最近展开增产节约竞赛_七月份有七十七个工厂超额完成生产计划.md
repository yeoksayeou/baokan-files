    Shenyang City Workers Launch Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    Seventy-Seven Factories Exceeded Production Plans in July

    (Xinhua News Agency) The broad masses of workers in state-owned and local state-owned factories in Shenyang City have recently launched an increase production and practice economy campaign to complete the state production plan. Currently, the workers of fifty-seven factories have taken action.

    In the competition, each factory has put forward different goals based on the completion of the national plan in the first half of the year, the production and sales of products, and the experience of increasing production and practicing economy last year. For example, some factories have better product quality and are very suitable for national construction and the needs of people's lives, so they propose to increase production on the basis of ensuring quality. Some factories have excessive production capacity and the product specifications are not suitable for national construction and the needs of people's lives, so they have determined to focus on improving product quality in the competition. After investigation and research, Shenyang Kiln Factory No. 2 determined that improving the quality and output of red bricks would be the direction of the competition. Many production teams have formulated advanced plans for increasing production and practicing economy. The Zhang Zengchuan team of the factory plans to guarantee the completion of the annual production plan ten days ahead of schedule by promoting advanced kiln firing experience and further implementing technical operating procedures. The monthly output will be increased from 1.15 million red bricks to 1.8 million bricks; the first-class products are also required to reach 88.5%, exceeding the national quality index by 3.5%, and it is planned to save 76 tons of pulverized coal. In the increase production and practice economy competition, the leadership of each factory focused on educating the workers to strengthen labor discipline, and paid attention to actively improving labor conditions and the welfare of workers.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] Seventy-seven state-owned and local state-owned factories in Shenyang City exceeded their July production plans. These factories include ten machinery factories such as Northeast Machinery Factory No. 1, four electrical factories such as Northeast Electrical Factory No. 3, and major factories such as Northeast Rubber Factory No. 7, Shenyang Water and Electrical Equipment Factory No. 1, Shenyang Refractory Material Factory, Shenyang Weaving Factory, Shenyang Lumber Mill, and Shenyang Paper Mill. Among the products of state-owned and local state-owned factories in the city, 36 major products have completed or exceeded their plans. These major products include equipment such as lathes, grinders, metal cutting beds, and transformers for new factories; rock drills and mine cars for mining; mud pumps for geological exploration; plumbing equipment for basic construction; 666 insecticide and fertilizer (bean cake) for agricultural production; and cotton yarn, cotton cloth, flour, paper, etc. for the material and cultural life of the people. The completion of these product plans is of great significance to meeting the industrial construction, rural construction and people's living needs of various places. The blower manufactured by Northeast Machinery Factory No. 4 in July not only meets the needs of the basic construction of the large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, but also provides ventilation equipment for factories and mines in the entire Northeast region and Southwest and Central South regions. The winches manufactured by the factory in July are not only supplied to the construction sites of the Construction Engineering Company of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau and various construction units in Heilongjiang, but also meet the requirements of the Central South Construction Engineering Bureau. This kind of machinery can replace a lot of heavy labor and accelerate the progress of the project. Various electrical equipment such as transformers and wires produced by Northeast Electrical Factory No. 5 and Electrical Factory No. 7 in July are being sent to all parts of the country.

    沈阳市广大职工最近展开增产节约竞赛
    七月份有七十七个工厂超额完成生产计划
    据新华社讯：沈阳市各国营和地方国营工厂的广大职工，最近展开了为完成国家生产计划的增产节约竞赛。目前，已有五十七个工厂的职工行动起来。
    在竞赛中，各厂都根据上半年完成国家计划的情况、产品的产销情况和去年增产节约的经验，提出了不同的奋斗目标。如有些工厂的产品质量较好，很适合国家建设和人民生活的需要，他们就提出在保证质量的基础上增加产量。有些工厂生产能力过大而产品规格又不适合于国家建设和人民生活需要，他们就确定以提高产品质量为竞赛的中心。沈阳市窑业二厂经过调查研究，确定以提高红砖的质量和产量为竞赛的方向以后，许多生产小组都订出了先进的增产节约计划。该厂张增传小组计划通过推广先进的烧窑经验，和进一步贯彻技术操作规程，保证提前十天完成全年的生产计划，月产量由一百一十五万块红砖，提高到一百八十万块；一等品也要求达到百分之八十八点五，超过国家质量指标百分之三点五，并计划节省粉煤七十六吨。在增产节约竞赛中，各厂的领导方面都着重对职工们进行了加强劳动纪律的教育，并注意积极改善劳动条件和职工的生活福利等问题。
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】沈阳市七十七个国营和地方国营工厂超额完成了七月份生产计划。这些工厂包括东北机械一厂等十个机械工厂、东北电工三厂等四个电工厂和东北橡胶七厂、沈阳水电器材一厂、沈阳耐火材料厂、沈阳织布厂、沈阳制材厂、沈阳造纸厂等主要工厂。全市国营和地方国营工厂的产品中，有三十六种主要产品完成或超额完成了计划。这些主要产品包括供给新建工厂用的车床、磨床、金属切削床、变压器等设备；有采矿用的凿岩机、矿车；有地质钻探用的泥浆泵；有供给基本建设用的水暖器材；有供给农业生产用的六六六杀虫剂、肥料（豆饼）和供给人民物质文化生活需用的棉纱、棉布、面粉、纸张等。这些产品计划的完成，对满足各地工业建设、农村建设和人民生活有很大意义。东北机械四厂七月份制造的送风机，不仅供给鞍钢的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂基本建设的需要，而且还供给东北全区和西南、中南等地的工厂、矿山装置通风设备。该厂七月份制造的卷扬机除了供给东北电业局所属建筑工程公司的建筑工地和黑龙江各建筑单位使用外，还满足了中南建筑工程局的要求。这种机械可以代替很多人的笨重劳动，并可加速工程进度。东北电工五厂和电工七厂七月份生产的变压器、电线等各种电工器材，正在送往全国各地。
