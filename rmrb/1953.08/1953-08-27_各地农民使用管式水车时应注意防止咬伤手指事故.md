    Central People's Government Ministry of Water Resources writes: Farmers in various places frequently experience accidents of having their fingers bitten off or injured by waterwheels when using tubular waterwheels. Last year, a farmer in Xingcheng County, Liaoxi, had a finger cut off by a gear when he went to add oil while the waterwheel was running. In Chenjia Village, Qufu County, Shandong, some farmers were busy attaching the chain when the waterwheel came off, but they didn't stop the waterwheel, or even if they stopped the waterwheel, they didn't hold the livestock, resulting in their fingers being injured by the chain. The Guangrao County Health Center in Shandong has treated more than 120 farmers with waterwheel-damaged fingers in the past three months. Last year, two farmers in Gaoyang County, Hebei, unfortunately died due to severe injuries.

    To prevent such accidents, farmers with tubular waterwheels must remember: never touch the gears, sprockets, or chains with your hands when the waterwheel is running; be sure to stop the waterwheel and hold the livestock when adding oil or repairing; use a chicken feather or a small oil brush when oiling the gears. Waterwheel lending departments and rural work cadres in various places should also pay attention to conducting safety education on the use of waterwheels for farmers.

### 各地农民使用管式水车时应注意防止咬伤手指事故

    各地农民使用管式水车时应注意防止咬伤手指事故
    中央人民政府水利部来信：各地农民在使用管式水车时，经常发生被水车咬断或咬伤手指的事故。去年辽西兴城县有一个农民在水车转动时去加油，不小心手指被齿轮切断了一个。山东曲阜县陈家庄也有些农民在水车脱链时忙着去挂链，但没有停住水车或者虽然停住水车而没有牵住牲口，以致手指被链子咬伤。山东广饶县卫生院最近三个月来治疗被水车咬坏手指的农民达一百二十多人。去年河北高阳县还有两个农民因受伤过重而不幸死亡。
    为了防止这种意外事故，装有管式水车的农民在使用时必须记住：水车在转动时千万不要用手去摸齿轮、链轮或链子；加油或修理时必须把水车停住，把牲口牵住；往齿轮上油时，可用鸡翎或小油刷子。各地水车出贷部门和农村工作干部也应该注意对农民进行使用水车的安全教育。
