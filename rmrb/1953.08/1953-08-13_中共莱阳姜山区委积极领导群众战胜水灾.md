The CCP Laiyang County Jiangshan District Committee in Shandong Province actively led the masses to rescue the flood. Jiangshan District has a low-lying terrain and has suffered from floods for years. Local farmers regard it as an incurable disease. On May 27th of this year, a sudden downpour caused the Wu Gu River to backflow, flooding the low-lying areas to a depth of three feet, submerging 30,000 mu of crops. At that time, the masses were very confused and generally reflected, "Everything is over, we can't live anymore." Some planned to sell their cattle and cultivate wasteland, some planned to abandon their homes and flee the famine, and some stayed in bed and refused to get up.

The members of the CCP Jiangshan District Committee immediately divided the work and conducted in-depth inspections, held meetings to study the disaster situation, analyzed the ideological situation of cadres and the masses, and emphasized that the District Committee should actively lead the masses to overcome difficulties and resolutely oppose the bureaucratic style of not caring about the suffering of the masses and not actively leading the masses to rescue the flood.

Then, they held small-scale symposiums with experienced farmers to discuss ways to rescue the flood with local farmers. The farmers attending the meeting put forward two requirements: first, the district and township should have unified leadership; second, everyone should unite and not only care about themselves. Regarding the former, the District Committee stated that it would resolutely take responsibility; regarding the latter, the District Committee stated that it would jointly take responsibility with everyone and mobilize the masses together. After repeated study, it was decided to drain the water as follows: first block the breaches, then drain the accumulated water, uniformly dredge the canals from bottom to top, open the upper reaches and do not block the lower reaches; divert water from the basin into small ditches, and then into large rivers; disperse small areas of water for drainage, and organize neighbors to drain large areas of water; unified leadership, division of labor, mutual assistance and unity, everyone benefits; discuss opinions together to prevent fighting.

After the symposium with experienced farmers, the District Committee held a series of meetings with cadres and the masses inside and outside the Party. Starting from caring for the suffering of the masses, ideological mobilization was carried out on cadres and the masses by using accounting comparisons and recalling past production and disaster relief. In this way, the masses' confidence in rescuing the flood was enhanced. At various meetings, the methods of rescuing the flood proposed at the symposium with experienced farmers were widely conveyed and discussed, and everyone expressed agreement. After the meeting, under the leadership of district and township cadres, the broad masses of people took action. Comrade Li Ruizhong, Secretary of the District Committee, personally led everyone to rush to repair the breaches and persisted in the rescue work in the water for six hours. District and township cadres all competed to be the first to take the lead in the rescue operation, without avoiding difficulties and dangers. When Comrade Ying Shishan, a district cadre, was inspecting the water situation, he discovered two other sections of the river embankment that were about to breach. He jumped into the water without regard for his safety and repaired the dangerous areas. Comrade Song Kekuan was persisting in blocking the breach in the water when he discovered that a section of the river embankment in Zhangjiazhuang on the opposite bank was about to breach. If it was not quickly rushed and blocked, the vast farmland of Zhangjiazhuang would soon be submerged. He braved the chest-deep water, faced the rapid current, crossed two rivers, arrived at Zhangjiazhuang, and mobilized the masses to rush to the rescue. The farmers in Zhangjiazhuang were very moved and went to the river with him to quickly repair the dangerous area. Due to the active leadership of district and township cadres, the masses were greatly encouraged, and the district-wide drainage movement quickly unfolded. In less than three days, the accumulated water was drained, and 30,000 mu of crops were saved.

After the flood rescue work was basically completed, the District Committee led the cadres and the masses throughout the district to summarize the experience of this flood rescue, and from bottom to top commended three district cadres, one township's CCP general branch committee, two village branch committees, and many model figures, conducting a profound practical education for cadres and the masses. Some cadres who had failed to lead the flood control work also made self-criticisms, expressing that they would resolutely change in the future. The enthusiasm of the village branches for leading production has also been enhanced: on the one hand, they actively lead the masses to transplant seedlings, replant seedlings, and repair and hoe; on the other hand, they re-examined and repaired dangerous sections of the embankment, and all villages have generally established flood prevention organizations.

    中共莱阳姜山区委积极领导群众战胜水灾
    中共山东省莱阳县姜山区委会积极领导群众抢救水灾。姜山区地势低洼，历年来不断发生水灾，当地农民把它看成是不治之症。今年五月二十七日突降急雨，五沽河河水倒灌，洼地积水三尺深，三万亩庄稼被淹没。当时群众思想很混乱，普遍反映：“一切都完了，日子不能过了。”有的打算卖牛渡荒，有的打算弃家逃荒，有的睡在炕上不起来。
    中共姜山区委员会各委员马上分工深入检查，举行了会议，研究了灾情，分析了干部和群众的思想情况，强调区委要积极领导群众排除困难，坚决反对不关心群众疾苦，不积极领导群众抢救水灾的官僚主义。
    接着他们又召开了小型老农座谈会，和当地农民研究抢救水灾办法。到会老农提出了两点要求：一是区、乡统一领导；一是大家团结，不能各顾各。对前一点，区委表示坚决负起责任来；对后一点，区委表示和大家共同负责，一齐动员群众。经反复研究，决定了排水的办法：先堵决口，后排积水，由下而上地统一疏渠，上开下不堵；盆地引水入小沟，小沟再引入大河；小片水分散排，大片水由地邻组织起来排；统一领导，分工分段，互助团结，大家有利；有意见大家商量，防止打架斗殴。
    老农座谈会后，区委又在党内党外召开了一系列的干部、群众会议，从体贴群众疾苦出发，采用算账对比和回忆往年生产救灾等方法，对干部和群众进行了思想动员。这样，就提高了群众抢救水灾的信心。在各种会议上，又广泛地传达和讨论了老农座谈会上提出的抢救水灾的办法，大家都表同意。会后，在区乡干部的带领下，广大群众行动起来了。区委书记李瑞忠同志亲自带领大家抢补决口，一直在水里坚持了六小时的抢救工作。区、乡干部在抢险行动中都个个争先恐后，不避艰险。区干部应时珊同志在检查水情时，发现了另外两处河堤即将决口，便奋不顾身地跳入水中，补好了险地。宋克宽同志正在水中坚持堵口时，发现对岸张家庄一段河堤即将决口，如不迅速抢堵，张家庄的广大农田，很快就会被淹没，他便冒齐胸大水，迎着急流，渡过了两道河，到达张家庄动员群众抢险。张家庄的农民很受感动，和他一齐到了河边，很快地把险工修补好了。由于区乡干部的积极领导，给群众的鼓舞很大，全区排水运动迅速展开，不到三天的时间，排尽了积水，救出了三万亩庄稼。
    抢救水灾工作基本结束后，区委领导全区干部和群众总结了这次抢救水灾的经验，自下而上地表扬了三名区干部，一个乡的中共总支委员会，两个村分支委员会及许多模范人物，对干部和群众进行了一次深刻的现实的教育。有些领导治水不力的干部也作了检讨，表示今后要坚决转变。各乡村支部领导生产的积极性也提高了：一方面积极领导群众移苗、补苗、修锄；一方面重新检查、修补了险工地段，各村还普遍建立了防汛组织。
