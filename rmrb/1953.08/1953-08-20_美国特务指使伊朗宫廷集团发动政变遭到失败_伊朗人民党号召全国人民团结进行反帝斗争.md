Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 19th: "Shahezmat Newspaper" published a letter to the people of Iran from the Central Committee of the Iranian People's Party on the 18th.

The letter to the people calls on the Iranian people to overthrow the monarchy and demands an immediate referendum on the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic, free and democratic elections, and the establishment of a constituent assembly to amend and supplement the constitution. The letter states that any attempt to maintain the monarchy by establishing a regency council is an act of betrayal of the national independence movement. The King—the number one agent of imperialism—has fled. However, other agents of the colonialists and other nests of conspiracy remain untouched. Therefore, the danger continues to exist.

The letter points out that US and British imperialists colluded in the rebellious conspiracy of the Iranian court clique. To eliminate the possibility of US imperialist conspiracies, all American advisors must be expelled, the institutions of the Truman "Point Four Program" General Administration in Iran must be abolished, American consulates and other American spy nests must be closed, and all enslaving treaties must be abolished.

The letter advocates that freedom of political parties, democratic parties, and trade unions must be guaranteed, martial law must be lifted, all political prisoners must be released, and freedom of activity must be guaranteed for the People's Party—the only party representing the Iranian people and the most reliable fortress in the Middle East's struggle against the colonial system.

The letter states that to achieve the goal of defeating imperialism, the primary step is to unite people from all walks of life and establish a national united front against imperialism. "In order to establish such a united front, the People's Party agrees to sincerely cooperate with all organizations and individuals who oppose the colonial system."

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Tehran News: The conspiracy of the Iranian court clique to launch a military coup under the manipulation of US special agents has failed. The King of Iran fled to Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, on the 16th.

On the evening of the 15th, Nasiri, commander of the Iranian King's Guard, led troops to arrest Foreign Minister Fatemi, Minister of Transportation Rajabi, Minister of Labor Yarami, and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army. Nasiri also brought armed forces to the residence of Prime Minister Mossadegh in an attempt to arrest Mossadegh. However, Nasiri was arrested by the guards at Mossadegh's residence.

Troops supporting the Mossadegh government restored order early on the morning of the 16th, released those arrested, and arrested more than 100 people, including a group of Royal Guard officers and opposition members of parliament.

Tehran's "Shahezmat Newspaper" pointed out that this coup was an attempt by US imperialism, through its special agents and Schwartzkov, the former American advisor to the Iranian Gendarmerie General Administration, to direct the Iranian court to quickly overthrow the current government through a military coup and establish a government similar to the Qavam government. The newspaper said that the King began his intense activities after meeting with Schwartzkov on the 9th. Note: Qavam was an imperialist dog who was supported by the United States in July 1952 but was quickly opposed by the people of the country and forced to resign.

The Iranian people, who are struggling for national independence and against imperialism and feudalism, expressed great anger at this new conspiracy of the United States and the court's collusion with US imperialism. People in Tehran, the capital of Iran, responded to the call of the Iranian National Anti-Imperialist Struggle Association and held a demonstration on the afternoon of the 16th. The demonstrators shouted slogans: "Down with the conspirators of the court!" "Long live the united front of the Iranian people against the colonial system!" "The Iranian people demand the expulsion of American spies!"

On the 17th, the masses gathered in Tehran destroyed all the commemorative statues of the King of Iran and his father in the city, and wrote on the remaining statue bases: "Yankees go home!" "Long live the people!"

    美国特务指使伊朗宫廷集团发动政变遭到失败
    伊朗人民党号召全国人民团结进行反帝斗争
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰讯：“沙查特报”在十八日刊载了伊朗人民党中央委员会告全国人民书。
    告人民书号召伊朗人民打倒君主制度，要求立即就消灭君主制度和建立共和国问题举行全民投票，举行自由的、民主的选举，成立制宪会议，以修改和补充宪法。告人民书说，凡是企图用成立摄政委员会等办法以保持君主制度的行动，都是背叛民族独立运动的行为。国王——帝国主义的头号代理人逃跑了。然而，殖民者的其他代理人和其他的阴谋巢穴仍然没有动。因此危险仍然继续存在。
    告人民书指出，美英帝国主义者勾结在一起，参与了这次伊朗宫廷集团的叛变阴谋。为了消除美帝国主义组织阴谋的可能性，就必须把所有美国顾问驱逐出去，取消杜鲁门“第四点计划”总署在伊朗各地的机构，封闭美国领事馆和其他美国间谍巢穴，废除一切奴役性的条约。
    告人民书主张，必须保证政党、民主党派和工会的自由，解除戒严状态，释放一切政治犯，保证人民党——唯一的代表伊朗人民的政党和中东反对殖民制度斗争的最可靠的堡垒——的活动自由。
    告人民书说，为达到战胜帝国主义的目的，首要步骤就是团结各阶层人民，建立反帝国主义的全国统一战线。“为了建立这样一个统一战线，人民党同意和一切反对殖民制度的组织和个人真诚合作。”
    【新华社十九日讯】德黑兰消息：伊朗宫廷集团在美国特务操纵下发动军事政变的阴谋遭到失败。伊朗国王已在十六日逃往伊拉克首都巴格达。
    十五日晚，伊朗国王御林军司令纳西里率领军队逮捕了外交大臣法特米、交通大臣拉贾比、劳工大臣亚勒米和陆军副参谋长。纳西里还带了武装部队到首相摩萨台的寓所，企图逮捕摩萨台。但是纳西里被摩萨台寓所的卫兵逮捕了。
    拥护摩萨台政府的军队在十六日清早恢复了秩序，释放了被捕者，并逮捕了一批御林军军官和反对派议员等一百多人。
    德黑兰“沙查特报”指出，这一次政变是美帝国主义想通过它的特务、伊朗宪兵总署前美国顾问施瓦兹科夫斯，指使伊朗宫廷，用军事政变的办法迅速推翻现在的政府，并成立一个类似盖凡姆政府的政府。该报说，国王是在九日和施瓦兹科夫斯会见后，开始他的紧张活动的。按：盖凡姆是美国在一九五二年七月间扶植上台但很快就受全国人民反对而被迫辞职的帝国主义走狗。
    正在为争取民族独立、反对帝国主义和封建制度而斗争的伊朗人民，对于美国的这一次新阴谋以及和美帝国主义勾结的宫廷表示极大愤怒。伊朗首都德黑兰人民响应伊朗全国反帝国主义斗争协会的号召，于十六日下午举行了示威游行。游行的人高呼口号：“打倒宫廷的阴谋者！”“伊朗人民反对殖民制度统一阵线万岁！”“伊朗人民要求把美国间谍驱逐出去！”
    十七日，群集在德黑兰的群众把该市所有的伊朗国王和他的父亲的纪念像摧毁，并在残留的纪念像座基上写着：“美国佬回家去！”“人民万岁！”
