Reader's Letters Digest

Should Rationally Use National Transportation Capacity

Editor's Note: The fundamental purpose of the planned transportation system of the People's Railways is to rationally utilize transportation capacity and maximize the role of railway transportation in national construction. To ensure the implementation of the planned transportation system, not only should railway departments conscientiously implement regulations and rules, but also all consigning units need to formulate their transportation plans accurately from the perspective of overall interests and cherish and rationally use national transportation capacity. However, at present, some consigning units allow goods to travel long distances on railway lines aimlessly, or occupy vehicles or transport materials over short distances extremely irrationally, resulting in the waste of national resources and even disrupting national transportation plans. This is very wrong. We believe that the relevant cadres of the consigning units exposed today must examine their overall perspective and avoid similar incidents from happening in the future; all enterprises, agencies, departments, and units must also educate relevant cadres to strictly abide by the regulations and systems of planned transportation of the People's Railways when handling freight consignments.

Five Electric Shovels Transported Back and Forth, Wasting Over Eight Thousand Kilometers

Liu Jiaxuan from Guangzhou Railway Sub-bureau writes: On June 29th, four flatbed cars loaded with electric shovels arrived at Guangzhou South Station from Manzhouli, the consignor was Changchun 652 Company, and the consignee was the South China Reclamation Bureau. On July 1st, the consigning unit applied to transfer these electric shovels to Huangpu Station; however, after arriving at Huangpu Station, only one of the four cars was unloaded, and the remaining three were applied by the consigning unit to be transported back to Mengjiatun in Northeast China. On July 11th, three more flatbed cars loaded with the same machines arrived at Guangzhou South Station, with the same consignor, consignee, originating station, and destination station as before. Of these three cars, one was transferred to Huangpu Station and unloaded, while the remaining two were applied by the consigning unit to be transported back to Mengjiatun in Northeast China without being unloaded.

The above two batches of electric shovels traveled a total of more than 4,600 kilometers by rail from Manzhouli to Guangzhou South Station; and another more than 3,400 kilometers back to Mengjiatun. That is to say, the two batches of electric shovels traveled back and forth, wasting over 8,000 kilometers. Because electric shovels are bulky and exceed the height and width limits when loaded, the railway stipulates that when passing through curves with a radius of 300 meters or less, or bridges underneath, and when entering and exiting stations, the locomotive speed is limited to 10 kilometers per hour for traffic safety; and the machines must be frequently and meticulously inspected along the way. Therefore, the running time from Manzhouli to Guangzhou South Station takes 27 days, and a round trip takes nearly two months. During this period, the electric shovels cannot be used during transportation, which is obviously a loss. And the five large flatbed cars from Manzhouli to Guangzhou South Station, and then back from Guangzhou South Station to Mengjiatun, each freight car calculated at 40 tons of freight, cost more than 270 million yuan. As for the loss of national transportation capacity, it is difficult to calculate. I think this problem is serious. Changchun 652 Company and South China Reclamation Bureau should jointly examine the reasons for this situation, seriously deal with the relevant personnel, and learn from this lesson to resolutely prevent the recurrence of such serious waste of national transportation capacity.

Irrational Use of Train Transportation Should Be Corrected

Lang Yongchang from Andong Railway Sub-bureau writes: Benxi No. 2 Cement Plant shipped 40 carloads of cement from Benxi Station to Benxi South Station in July, of which 13 carloads were shipped to the shaft project of Benxi Mining Bureau, one carload was shipped to the material department of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, and the remaining 26 carloads were shipped to the Benxi Municipal Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, Industry Bureau, and Construction Bureau. Benxi Station is only 5.2 kilometers away from Benxi South Station, and I think it is unreasonable to use trains for such short-distance transportation. For example, Benxi No. 2 Cement Plant is 4 kilometers away from Benxi Station, but less than 2 kilometers away from the shaft project of Benxi Mining Bureau, and it should be transported by trucks or other means of transportation. However, the consignor and the ordering unit proceed from their own interests and transport it by rail in order to reduce freight costs. The railway department needs to go through a very complicated process to transport cement from Benxi No. 2 Cement Plant to the shaft project of Benxi Mining Bureau: first send empty cars to the cement plant, load the cars, and then use the company's locomotive to haul them to Benxi Station, then transfer them to the station to compile a small operation, hang them to Benxi South Station, disassemble them and then send them to the special line of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, transfer them to the company's locomotive to the Gongyuan Station to compile and hang them on the car, transport them to the company's Baojia Station, and then disassemble them and send them to the shaft line to unload. The time for this series of shunting operations is 20 hours; while the travel time from Benxi Station to Benxi South Station is usually only 8 minutes. In terms of transportation time alone, the waste is already alarming; as for the loss caused to the country due to the reduction of vehicle turnover rate, it is even greater.

The unreasonable practice of Benxi No. 2 Cement Plant in using railway transportation capacity must be stopped in time. The railway department responsible for approving this plan did not even discover this problem, which is also inappropriate. This kind of unreasonable transportation phenomenon may also exist on other railways. It is recommended that the Ministry of Railways attach importance to this issue and instruct the departments of each railway unit responsible for approving transportation plans to revise the plans in time when similar phenomena are discovered.

Harbin Wood Factory of the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways Randomly Submits Consignment Plans, Seriously Accumulating Cars

Wu Jingxin from Jiamusi Station writes: The consignment plan formulated by Harbin Wood Factory of the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways is extremely impractical, resulting in a serious accumulation of car phenomenon. The factory submitted a transportation plan to Jiamusi Station from June 6th to the end of June, requiring a total of 281 cars, but actually loaded 38 cars, only completing 13.5% of the plan. The actual number of cars loaded in July was only 10% of the transportation plan. In the first five days of August, the plan required 106 cars, and 22 cars were actually loaded; the plan for the second five days was 72 cars, but only 14 cars were loaded by the 8th. The above phenomenon has caused a large number of railway cars to be shelved, and disrupted the entire railway transportation plan.

The reason why this situation occurs is inseparable from the factory's erroneous thinking of not paying attention to railway planned transportation. The factory adopted the wrong attitude of "rather ask for more than less" when formulating the transportation plan, and randomly put forward impractical plans regardless of whether there were goods to be loaded. More seriously, the factory still does not care about the repeated accumulation of car situations; when the station personnel put forward opinions on their failure to complete the transportation plan, they are still unwilling to face up to their mistakes and refuse to accept opinions.

It should be pointed out that the factory is an internal unit of the railway system and should model the implementation of the railway planned transportation system; now they have adopted an extremely irresponsible attitude towards planned transportation work, causing losses to the country, which is extremely wrong. Harbin Wood Factory should check the above situation, quickly improve its work, and ensure that it formulates and implements the transportation plan seriously in the future. The Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways should also inspect the factory's work and urge the factory to correct the above errors.

Small Amount of Goods Should Not Occupy Whole Car for Transportation

Letter from Dalian North Station: On July 23rd, the Bridge First Engineering Team of the Engineering Office under the Harbin Railway Administration transported a generator from Dalian North Station to Shiqiaozi. The generator only weighed three tons, but the Bridge First Engineering Team used a car under the pretext of urgent need, causing a waste of transportation capacity. On June 26th, Jinan No. 4 Machine Factory shipped a lathe from Dalian North Station to Jinan. The lathe only weighed two tons, but the factory wanted to use a 30-ton car to ship it out. We suggested that the factory handle less-than-carload transportation, but the factory emphasized that it already had a monthly plan and did not accept our opinion. After our inspection, it turned out that the batch of goods listed in the factory's monthly plan was not two tons, but twenty tons. We refused to load the lathe into the whole car, and the factory was very dissatisfied.

The above two facts show that some consigning units still have the wrong idea of "only caring about their own convenience and disregarding the overall interests" when using railway transportation. This has directly affected the implementation of the national transportation plan and caused a waste of national transportation capacity. We believe that the leaders of the above two units must correct this practice in the future, and other consigning units with similar situations should also pay attention to this issue.

A Dead Cow Should Not Travel More Than 800 Kilometers on a Train

Letter from Zhi Jun of the Business Office of Jinzhou Railway Administration: On July 25th, the Livestock Department of Shenyang Native Produce Company entrusted the railway to transport 63 live cattle from Yanzhou, Shandong to Huanggu Tun, Liaodong. When the train carrying the cattle arrived at Jinan Station, one cow died on the train. The escort Tian Baodai asked Jinan Station to unload the dead cow. However, Jinan Station refused to unload the dead cow on the pretext that the parking time was too short (the actual parking time was more than 40 minutes), and perfunctorily told Tian Baodai that it had contacted Dezhou Station and the dead cow could be unloaded at Dezhou Station. But in fact, Jinan Station did not contact Dezhou Station, and the train arrived at Dezhou Station late at night, so the dead cow had to be transported forward. At 10:00 a.m. the next morning, the train arrived at Tianjin North Station, with a parking time of more than 10 hours, but the station also refused the request to unload the dead cow and pushed it to Tianjin East Station. As a result, Tianjin East Station and Shanhaiguan Station also refused to allow unloading. Finally, the dead cow was unloaded when the train arrived at Jinzhou. The dead cow had been delayed on the road for 49 hours, and had rotted and maggots had grown, and the stench was pungent. When unloading the car, the porters were unwilling to carry it, and the cart drivers were unwilling to pull it. As a result, the consignor spent a high salary of more than 400,000 yuan to solve the problem of transporting and burying the dead cow.

A dead cow actually traveled more than 800 kilometers by train! The reason why this intolerable phenomenon occurs is inseparable from the erroneous thinking of Jinan and other stations that they are afraid of trouble. They only want to save trouble for themselves, but do not consider the hazards that dead cows may cause on the train. This kind of departmentalism will cause damage to various tasks, and the above-mentioned "dead cow travel" incident is just a small example.

     读者来信摘要
    应该合理使用国家运输力量
    编者按：人民铁路实行计划运输的根本目的，在于合理使用运输力量，最大限度地发挥铁路交通工具在国家建设中的作用。为使计划运输制度得以保证贯彻，不仅铁路部门要认真执行制度规章，各托运单位更需要从整体利益着眼，准确地制订本单位的运输计划，珍惜并合理地使用国家的运输力量。但是，目前有些托运单位漫无目标地让货物在铁路线上长途旅行，或是极不合理地占用车辆或短途运送物资，以致浪费了国家资财，甚或打乱了国家的运输计划。这是非常错误的。我们认为，今天被揭发的托运单位的有关干部，必须检查自己的整体观念，避免今后同类事件发生；一切企业、机关、部门、单位也必须教育有关干部，在办理货物托运中，严格遵守人民铁路计划运输的规章和制度。
    五车电铲机往返调运白白走了八千多公里
    广州铁路分局刘家璹来信：六月二十九日，广州南站到达由满洲里开来装载电铲机的大平板车四辆，发货者是长春六五二公司，收货者是华南垦殖局。七月一日，托运单位申请把这批电铲机转票运往黄埔站；但是在到达黄埔站后，四辆车只卸空了一辆，其余三辆又由托运单位申请运回东北孟家屯。七月十一日，广州南站又到达装载同一机器的大平板车三辆，发货者、收货者、发站、到站都与上次相同。这三辆车除一辆经转票运到黄埔站后卸空外，其余二辆又经托运单位申请原封不动地运回东北孟家屯。
    上述两批电铲机从满洲里运到广州南站，铁路里程共四千六百多公里；再运回孟家屯，铁路里程又是三千四百多公里。这就是说，两批电铲机往返调运，白白走了八千多公里。因为电铲机体积庞大，装载时超高超宽，铁路方面为了行车安全，规定行经半径三百公尺以内的曲线或下承桥梁以及出入车站时，机车行速都限制为十公里；沿途并需经常对机器作细密检查。因此，从满洲里到广州南站的运行时间共需二十七天，一次往返所需时间将近二个月。在这个时期内，电铲机在运输途中不能使用，显然是一种损失。而五辆大平板车从满洲里到广州南站、再从广州南站放回孟家屯，每辆货车以四十吨计算运费，共需二亿七千万元以上。至于国家运输力量所受损失也是难以计算的。我认为这个问题是严重的。长春六五二公司和华南垦殖局双方应该共同检查造成这种情况的原因，对有关人员进行严肃处理，并由此吸取教训，坚决防止今后再发生这种严重浪费国家运输力量的事件。
    应该纠正使用火车运输的不合理现象
    安东铁路分局郎永昌来信：本溪第二水泥厂在七月份从本溪站发往本溪南站水泥四十车，其中十三车是运往本溪矿务局竖井工程的，一车是运往本溪钢铁公司材料处的，其余二十六车是运往本溪市内农林局、工业局及建设局等单位的。本溪站距本溪南站仅五点二公里，我认为使用火车作这种短距离运输是不合理的。如本溪第二水泥厂距本溪站有四公里，而距离本溪矿务局竖井工程却不到二公里，完全应该用汽车或其它运输工具运送。但发货单位与订货单位从本位利益出发，为了降低运费，就通过铁路运送。铁路方面把水泥从本溪第二水泥厂运往本溪矿务局竖井工程需要经过非常繁复的过程：先把空车送到水泥厂，装车后又以公司机车牵引送到本溪站，再换铁路机车拉到站内编组小运转，挂到本溪南站，解体后再送入本溪钢铁公司专用线，由公司机车调入工源站编挂到车上，运到公司的鲍家站，再解体送入竖井线卸车。这一连串调车作业的时间共需二十小时；而通常由本溪站到本溪南站的行车时间却只要八分钟。仅就运输时间来说，浪费已经很惊人了；至于因减低车辆周转率而给国家造成的损失更是巨大的。
    本溪第二水泥厂这种不合理地使用铁路运输力量的做法必须及时加以制止。负责批审这批计划的铁路部门竟然没有发现这个问题，也是不应该的。这种不合理运输的现象在其它铁路上可能也有。建议铁道部重视这个问题，指示各铁路单位负责批审运输计划的部门在发现类似现象时及时把计划修正。
    铁道部材料局哈尔滨木材厂乱提托运计划严重积压车皮
    佳木斯车站吴景新来信：铁道部材料局哈尔滨木材厂制定的托运计划极不切合实际，以致造成严重积压车皮的现象。该厂向佳木斯车站提出的从六月六日到六月底的运输计划共要车皮二百八十一辆，但实际上装了三十八辆，只完成计划的百分之十三点五。七月份的实际装车数也只有运输计划的百分之十。八月份第一个五日计划要车一百零六辆，实际装出二十二辆；第二个五日计划是七十二辆，但到八日为止仅装出十四辆。上述现象已使铁路车皮大量搁置，并打乱了整个铁路运输计划。
    这种情况之所以发生，是和该厂不重视铁路计划运输的错误思想分不开的。该厂在制订运输计划时采取了“宁可多提，不能少要”的错误态度，不管有没有要装车的货，就胡乱地提出不切合实际的计划。更严重的是：该厂对屡次积压车皮的情况还毫不在乎；当车站人员对他们不能完成运输计划的问题提出意见时，他们仍不愿正视错误，拒绝接受意见。
    应该指出：该厂是铁路系统的内部单位，应该模范地贯彻执行铁路计划运输的制度；现在他们却对计划运输工作采取了极不负责的态度，以致给国家造成损失，这是极其错误的。哈尔滨木材厂应该对以上情况进行检查，迅速改进工作，保证今后认真制定并切实执行运输计划。铁道部材料局也应对该厂工作进行检查，督促该厂纠正上述错误。
    少量货物不应占用整车装运
    大连北站来信：哈尔滨铁路管理局所属工程处桥梁第一工程队在七月二十三日从大连北站把一部发电机运到石桥子去。这部发电机仅重三吨，可是桥梁第一工程队藉口急用，就占用了一个车皮，造成运输力量的浪费。六月二十六日，济南第四机器厂由大连北站发往济南车床一台。这台车床仅重二吨，该厂却要用三十吨的车皮运出。我们建议该厂办理零担运输，该厂却强调已有月度计划而不接受我们的意见。经我们检查，原来该厂月度计划表内所列的一批货物并不是二吨，而是二十吨。我们拒绝把这台车床装整车，该厂还表示非常不满。
    以上两件事实说明，有些托运单位在使用铁路运输时还有着“只管自己方便、不顾整体利益”的错误思想。这已直接影响了国家运输计划的执行，造成了国家运输力量的浪费。我们认为，上述两个单位的领导方面今后必须纠正这种做法，其它有类似情况的托运单位也应该注意这个问题。
    不该把一头死牛放在火车上旅行八百多公里
    锦州铁路管理局商务处之军来信：七月二十五日，沈阳市土产公司畜产部委托铁路方面把活牛六十三头从山东兖州运到辽东皇姑屯。当装载这批牛的列车到达济南站时，车上死了一头牛。该车押运员田宝玳就向济南车站提出要将这头死牛卸下。但济南车站竟藉口停车时间太短（实际停车时间有四十多分钟），不准把死牛卸下，并且敷衍田宝玳说已与德州站联系好了，这头死牛可以在德州站卸下。但是实际上济南站并未和德州站联系，同时列车到达德州站时正值深夜，所以，只得将死牛继续前运。次日上午十时，列车到达天津北站，停车时间在十小时以上，但该站也拒绝了卸下死牛的要求，又推给天津东站处理。结果天津东站和山海关站也都不让卸。最后直到这次列车到达锦州时，死牛才被卸下。这头死牛因为在路上耽搁了四十九小时，已经腐烂生蛆，臭气扑鼻。卸车时搬运工人不愿搬，大车工人不愿拉，结果托运单位化了四十多万元的高额工资，才解决了死牛的搬运和掩埋问题。
    一头死牛竟然乘火车旅行了八百多公里！这种使人不能容忍的现象之所以会发生，是和济南等地车站怕麻烦的错误思想分不开的。他们只图自己省事，却不考虑死牛在车上可能引起的危害。这种本位主义思想对各项工作都会造成损害，上面所说的
    “死牛旅行”事件只是一个小小的例子而已。
