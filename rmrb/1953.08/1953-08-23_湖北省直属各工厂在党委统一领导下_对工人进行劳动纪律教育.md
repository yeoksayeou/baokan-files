Hubei Province's directly subordinate Wuhan and Suihua Match Factories, Provincial Agricultural Tool Manufacturing Factory, Dada Tobacco Factory, Xinhua Glass Factory, Guanghua Thread Factory, Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory, and others, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, successively carried out labor discipline education among the worker masses of their respective factories around June 10th, to overcome the lax labor discipline phenomena in production.

Since the production reform movement was launched in the province's directly subordinate factories, the enthusiasm and production initiative of the workers and staff have ensured the completion and overfulfillment of production plans. However, on the other hand, due to the lack of production management experience and the imperfection of various systems on the part of the leadership, especially the weakness of political and ideological work, the phenomenon of lax labor discipline is still quite serious. For example, from January to May of this year, the Provincial Agricultural Tool Manufacturing Factory had as many as 36,296 lost work hours due to absenteeism, which is almost equivalent to the factory's workshops directly participating in production being shut down for twelve and a half days. Therefore, the factory failed to complete its production task for the first quarter. In Wuhan, Suihua and other factories, those who violated labor discipline accounted for more than 10% of the total number of employees.

When the education on strengthening labor discipline began in each factory, it always started with the Party members first, then non-Party members, first the backbone, then the masses. First, Party members, League members, and cadres above the level of trade union group leader were convened to study documents and the instructions of the Party Committee. In the study, several erroneous ideas were criticized, reaching a consensus of understanding and thought, laying the foundation for the smooth progress of strengthening labor discipline education. Then, the concerns and incorrect views of workers on strengthening labor discipline were studied. The spirit and resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union were conveyed to the workers, and communist education and education on being the masters of the country were conducted. Then, typical reports were further organized, discussions were launched, and criticism and self-criticism were carried out. At the same time, the method of detailed accounting was adopted (for example, the Wuhan Match Factory learned through detailed accounting that from January to May, illness, personal leave, and absenteeism totaled 2,800 workdays. If each workday is calculated as nine hours, it would result in 2,300 fewer cases of matches being produced, equivalent to 440 million yuan), so that everyone realized that failure to abide by labor discipline would bring serious losses to national construction and have a direct impact on the improvement of workers' welfare.

After these ideological education efforts, the political consciousness of the worker masses in various factories has been initially improved. They have realized their position in economic construction. The non-working-class thinking of belittling labor has been criticized, and the idea of "labor is glorious" has been established among the workers. At present, the attendance rate of each factory has increased. For example, the absenteeism rate of the Dada Tobacco Factory has dropped from over 13% to 10%; the Suihua Match Factory has dropped from 10% to 5%; and the Wuhan Match Factory has dropped from 13% to 9%.

Currently, the Provincial Agricultural Tool Manufacturing Factory has entered the stage of self-examination, personal summary, and formulation of covenants in the education work of strengthening labor discipline; the Dada Tobacco Factory has entered the stage of evaluating production models and excellent workers, and some factories have begun to establish factory rules and formulate various systems.

    湖北省直属各工厂在党委统一领导下
    对工人进行劳动纪律教育
    湖北省直属武汉、燧华两火柴厂、省农具制造厂、大达烟厂、新华玻璃厂、光华线厂、新华化学制药厂等，在党委的统一领导下，于六月十日左右，先后在本厂工人群众中进行劳动纪律的教育，克服生产中劳动纪律松弛的现象。
    省直属各厂自从生产改革运动开展以来，由于职工群众的劳动热情和生产积极性，保证了生产计划的完成和超额完成。但另一方面，因为领导上缺乏生产管理经验和各种制度不健全，特别是政治思想工作的薄弱，所以，劳动纪律的松弛现象还相当严重。如省农具制造厂今年一月至五月，缺勤就达三万六千二百九十六个工时，几乎等于该厂各车间直接参加生产的工人停工十二天半。因此，该厂第一季度生产任务没能完成。武汉、燧华等厂违反劳动纪律的占全厂职工总数百分之十以上。
    各厂在加强劳动纪律教育开始时，都是先党内后党外，先骨干后群众。首先召集党团员和工会小组长以上的干部学习文件和党委的指示，在学习中批判了几种错误思想，达到认识一致，思想一致，为顺利进行加强劳动纪律教育打下基础。然后研究了工人思想上对加强劳动纪律存在的顾虑和不正确的看法，对工人传达了中国工会第七次全国代表大会的精神和决议，进行共产主义教育和国家主人翁的教育。接着进一步组织典型报告，展开讨论，并进行批评与自我批评。同时，又采取了算细账的办法，（如武汉火柴厂通过算细账知道该厂一月份至五月份，病、事假及旷工共为二千数百个工作日，如每工作日以九小时计，少生产二千三百篓火柴，合四亿四千万元。）使大家认识到不遵守劳动纪律会给国家建设带来严重损失，对工人福利的提高也有直接影响。
    经过这些思想教育后，各厂工人群众的政治觉悟已有初步提高，认识到了自己在经济建设中的地位，轻视劳动的非工人阶级思想已受到批判，“劳动光荣”的思想已在工人中树立起来。目前，各厂的出勤率都有了提高。如大达烟厂缺勤率已由百分之十三强降到百分之十；燧华火柴厂由百分之十降到百分之五；武汉火柴厂由百分之十三降到百分之九。
    现在，加强劳动纪律的教育工作，省农具制造厂已进入自己检查，个人总结，订立公约的阶段；大达烟厂已进入到评选生产模范和优良工作者，有的厂并已开始建立厂规和订立各种制度。
