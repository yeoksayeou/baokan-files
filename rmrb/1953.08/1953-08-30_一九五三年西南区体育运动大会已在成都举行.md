    The 1953 Southwest China Sports Meet was held in Chengdu from August 23rd to 27th. More than 500 athletes, delegation members, and dance team members, including workers, peasants, cadres, and students of various ethnic groups such as Han, Tibetan, Hui, Miao, and Yi from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, and Chongqing, participated in the conference.

    The conference held fifty competitions including track and field, gymnastics, cycling, weightlifting, and three boxing performances. Among them, three results broke the national records of 1952: Men's 200-meter low hurdle: 27.6 seconds; Men's 1,500-meter medley relay race: 3 minutes 44 and 3/5 seconds; Women's 200-meter race: 28.1 seconds. In addition, seventeen track and field events broke the Southwest's highest records. These results show that the level of sports in Southwest China has greatly improved. In various competitions, workers and athletes from ethnic minorities also achieved excellent results. Yang Shuqing, a female porter representing Sichuan Province, won third place in the women's track and field individual all-around, and Long Kemin, a female Yi athlete from Guizhou Province, won fourth place in the women's track and field individual all-around. The conference also selected representatives from the Southwest region to participate in the "1953 National Track and Field, Gymnastics, and Cycling Sports Meet" to be held in Beijing in October this year.

    During the conference, the Southwest Aviation Model Training Class performed aviation model shows, and the Xikang delegation's dance team performed "Han and Tibetan People are of One Heart." These performances were warmly welcomed by more than 20,000 spectators.
