Short Commentary:

    The editorial "The Quality of Inspection Work Must Be Improved" published in this newspaper on June 20 pointed out the importance of inspection work and emphasized the need to overcome the perfunctory attitude in inspection work. Recently, many units have begun to pay attention to inspecting the work of the inspection teams they send out, but there are still many phenomena that should arouse our attention. That is, some units do not make sufficient preparations before sending inspection personnel and lack a clear purpose; or the quality of the inspection personnel sent out is not strong, and the number is too large; and some units of the same nature could have been organized together for inspection, but due to a lack of prior contact, they were not organized, resulting in each doing its own thing. As a result, in some areas and units, chaotic phenomena such as duplication, multiple inspections, and overcrowding of personnel have formed in inspection work, and the cadres and masses criticize the inspection teams as "too many dragons not controlling the water." This phenomenon must be changed quickly.
    The existence of chaotic phenomena in inspection work not only cannot help solve the problems below but also adds a lot of trouble to the inspected areas and units, affecting the progress of work and production. For example, in Jingyang County, Shaanxi, recently, there have been six inspection teams working in the county, including the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee's Rural Work Department Working Group, the Weinan Prefectural Commissioner's Office Working Group, the joint working group organized by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Northwest Institute of Science Working Group, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Supervisory Committee Working Group, and the Shaanxi Provincial Finance and Economics Committee Working Group. As soon as these inspection teams arrive in the county, they ask for materials, reports, and request the county to send cadres to assist in their work. For this reason, the county often needs to extract two or three more responsible cadres to receive the inspection teams. This adds a lot of extra burden to the county's leading cadres and greatly affects the leadership of the summer harvest work. Another example is the Shanghai Purchasing Station of China Department Store Company. Since March of this year, a total of 25 or 26 units have come to the unit to understand the situation, request information, and inspect the work, from the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Finance, to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the Tax Bureau, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, etc., coming and going in a hurry, causing some cadres of the station to abandon their current business and specialize in finding materials and reporting the situation for the inspection teams, which has greatly affected the station's work.
    After individual inspection teams arrive at the inspected area or unit, they often do not humbly and conscientiously go deep into understanding the situation, find problems and come up with solutions while assisting local cadres in doing the work that is being carried out locally, carefully analyze the shortcomings they discover, find out the subjective and objective reasons for these shortcomings, and help the inspected units overcome these shortcomings and improve their work; but they only ask here and look there superficially, and without understanding the whole situation, they arbitrarily express opinions, criticizing this and blaming that. For example, not long ago, the Weinan Prefectural Commissioner's Office inspection team, when inspecting work in Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, only stayed in the county for a few days and did not conduct in-depth understanding, so they wrote a summary report to the Weinan Prefectural Commissioner's Office, concluding that: "The shortcomings of Jingyang County's work are generalized leadership and lack of specific methods..." This made the county's leading cadres feel that the opinions raised by the inspection team were also very generalized and not very specific, and did not help the work much. There are even individual inspection teams that, when going down to inspect work, do not go through the local party committee and leading organs, do not take care of local work, do not carefully consider major policy issues, and do not consult the local party committee in advance, so they rashly make decisions, which leads to conflicts with the local party committee's current work, causing undue losses to the work. For example, the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Office Inspection Team of the Central Ministry of Communications' Maritime Affairs General Bureau, when inspecting work in a certain lighthouse manufacturing plant in Shanghai, did not discuss with the local party committee in advance, and easily announced to all employees that they would comprehensively adjust wages in the plant; but in fact, the conditions for comprehensively adjusting wages in the plant were not yet met at that time, and the adjustment could not be carried out at all. This aroused great dissatisfaction among the plant's employees and put the plant's leadership in a passive position. The above examples show that, at present, there are still many problems with the inspection teams sent by the central and local leading departments, which should arouse the serious attention of all leading organs; the work of the inspection teams that have been sent out, especially those that have not yet completed their work, should be thoroughly inspected, the experience should be summarized, the mistakes should be corrected, and the work style of the inspection teams should be seriously improved.
    Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his summary report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "It should be remembered that the purpose of inspecting the implementation of decisions is primarily to expose shortcomings, expose illegal acts, help loyal workers, offer them advice, punish incorrigible elements, and ensure the implementation of adopted decisions, study experience, and, on the basis of this experience, ensure that established tasks are solved in the most correct, beneficial, and economical way. Bureaucratic attitudes towards the issue of inspecting the implementation of decisions must not be tolerated." That is to say, inspection work is an important task to supervise and ensure its realization after formulating correct policies and deploying implementation, and it is an indispensable part of leadership work. Therefore, we must carry out inspection work with a serious attitude and a pragmatic work style. We must make serious preparations beforehand and conscientiously summarize afterward, establish an excellent and conscientious inspection work style, so that inspection work can truly play a positive role in improving work and enhancing work.

### 对检查组的工作必须加以检查

    对检查组的工作必须加以检查
    六月二十日本报曾发表“必须提高检查工作的质量”的社论，指出检查工作的重要，同时强调应克服检查工作中草率从事的作风。最近许多单位已经开始注意检查本单位所派出的检查组的工作，但是还有许多现象仍应引起我们的注意。这就是有些单位在派出检查人员之前，没有进行充分准备，缺乏明确的目的；或者派出的检查人员质量不强，数量过多；还有些性质相同的单位，本可以组织到一起去检查，但由于事先缺乏联系，没有组织起来，结果是各搞各的一套。因而在某些地区、某些单位便形成了检查工作上的重复、多头、人员拥挤等混乱现象，下面干部和群众批评检查组是“龙多不治水”。这种现象必须迅速加以改变。
    检查工作上的混乱现象的存在，不仅不能有助于解决下面的问题，反而给被检查的地区、单位增加了许多麻烦，影响到工作和生产的进行。如陕西泾阳县，最近到该县检查工作的，就有中共中央西北局农村工作部工作组、陕西渭南专署工作组、中央人民政府农业部和陕西省农林厅所组织的联合工作组、西北科学研究所工作组、陕西省人民监察委员会工作组和陕西省财政经济委员会工作组等六个检查组。这些检查组一到县上，就要材料，要汇报，要求县上派干部协助工作。为此，该县经常需要抽出两、三位比较负责的干部来接待检查组。这样，就给该县领导干部增加了不少额外负担，大大地影响了对夏收工作的领导。又如中国百货公司上海采购站，自今年三月以来，到该单位了解情况、索取资料、检查工作的单位，共计有二十五、六个之多，从中央人民政府商业部、财政部、直到上海市工商局、税务局、工商联等，此来彼往，时间仓促，致使该站部分干部不得不丢弃当前业务不管，来专门为检查组找寻材料，汇报情况，使该站工作受到很大影响。
    个别检查组到达被检查地区或单位之后，往往不是虚心认真地深入了解情况，在协助当地干部做好当地正在进行的工作中，来发现问题，想出解决办法，对发现的缺点进行仔细的分析，弄清楚产生这些缺点的主观和客观的原因，帮助被检查的单位克服这些缺点，改进工作；而只是肤浅地这里问问，那里看看，未了解到事情的全面，就自以为是地乱发议论，这也批评，那也指责。如不久以前，陕西省渭南专署检查组，到陕西泾阳县检查工作时，只在县上停了几天，未进行深入了解，便给渭南专署写了一个总结报告，下结论说：“泾阳县工作的缺点是一般化领导，缺乏具体办法……。”致使该县领导干部觉得：检查组提的意见也很一般化，也很不具体，对工作帮助不大。甚至还有个别的检查组，下去检查工作时，不通过当地党委和领导机关，不照顾当地工作，对有关政策性的重大问题，不加慎重考虑，也不事先征求当地党委意见，就轻率做出决定，以致和当地党委当前工作发生矛盾，使工作受到不应有的损失。如中央交通部航务总局上海航务处检查组，在上海某灯标制配厂检查工作时，事先未和当地党委研究，就在全体职工中轻易宣布：要在该厂全面调整工资；而事实上该厂当时全面调整工资的条件尚未具备，根本无法进行调整。这就引起了该厂职工的极大不满，使该厂领导陷于被动。以上这些例子说明，在目前，中央和地方各级领导部门所派出的检查组，还存在着不少问题，应该引起各领导机关的严重注意；对所派出的检查组，特别是对那些现时尚未结束工作的检查组的工作情况，进行一次彻底的检查，总结经验，纠正错误，认真改进检查组的工作作风。
    马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的总结报告中指出：“应当记住，检查执行情况的目的首先是揭发缺点，揭露非法行为，帮助忠诚的工作人员、向他提出意见，惩罚不可救药的分子，并保证已通过的决定的执行，研究经验，并在这种经验的基础上保证既定任务得到最正确的、有利的、经济的解决。决不能容忍对检查决定执行情况的问题采取官僚主义的态度”。这就是说，检查工作是在制定正确政策和布置执行之后，加以督促并保证其实现的重要工作，是领导工作不可缺少的一部分。因此，我们必须以严肃的态度和实事求是的工作作风来进行检查工作。事前要认真作好准备，事后要认真做出总结，树立起优良的认真的检查作风，使检查工作能真正发挥改进工作和提高工作的积极效果和作用。
