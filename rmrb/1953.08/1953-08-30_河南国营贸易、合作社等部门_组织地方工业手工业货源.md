Henan State-Owned Trading, Cooperative and Other Departments
Organize Local Industrial and Handicraft Goods Sources

    In the work of purchasing agricultural crops, Henan Province's state-owned trading, cooperative and other departments vigorously organized local goods sources, commissioned processing and ordering from handicrafts, and expanded supply, which has achieved remarkable results.
    In the previous period, due to the inadequate estimation of the growing purchasing power of the broad masses by cadres of Henan Province's state-owned trading, cooperative and other departments, and the blind compression of inventory, a widespread shortage of major commodities formed after the wheat harvest. In June, according to incomplete statistics from fourteen units including state-owned trading companies and cooperatives: 170 kinds of items such as fertilizers and agricultural tools were out of stock, and 67 kinds of various cotton cloths were out of stock. This not only affected the wheat purchasing work, but also affected farmers' investment in production, causing farmers' dissatisfaction.
    In order to solve the above problems, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Finance and Economic Commission have convened relevant units for discussion, re-revised the social commodity circulation plan for the second half of the year, and at the same time decided that provincial industries should appropriately increase production, and supply and marketing cooperatives should expand the operation of fertilizers and agricultural tools. In terms of organizing goods sources and expanding supply:
    1. Purchase locally, process locally, and supply locally. The Provincial Cotton and Cloth Company has processed and purchased cloth in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Anyang and other places in July, which basically solved the problem of cloth shortage. At the same time, since handicraft products account for a large proportion of rural supplies, in terms of organizing handicraft goods sources, the provincial cooperative's retail plan for the whole province has expanded by 110.4 percent compared with the same period last year. Among them, the province's and special district's wholesale business operation of living materials has expanded from more than 100 kinds to more than 200 kinds of local industrial, handicraft and non-provincial industrial commodities. The processing quantity of production materials such as fertilizers and agricultural tools is also very large. Special district and county trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives have also begun to strengthen ties with handicrafts and carry out processing orders.
    2. Strengthen the allocation and procurement from other regions and the rational internal adjustment. Regarding procurement from other places, the Provincial Cotton and Cloth Company transferred more than 300,000 bolts of cloth from Shanghai, Shandong, Jiangsu, Beijing and other places in July. The Provincial Cooperative purchased a large number of socks, cloth, towels, bed sheets, etc. in Shanghai, and also purchased a batch of rubber shoes, washbasins, etc. At the same time, the state-owned trading system and the cooperative internally carried out rational adjustments, overcoming the unreasonable phenomenon that certain commodities were out of stock in place A and overstocked in place B.
    In order to supply materials to consumers in a timely manner, state-owned trading departments and cooperatives have more generally adopted supply methods such as delivering goods to the countryside, exchanging goods for grain, and carrying out small-scale material exchange meetings and commodity exhibitions in market towns and villages; the advantage of doing so is that it is flexible and convenient, does not delay agricultural work, and those with money buy with money, and those with grain exchange for grain. For example, the Guo Zhuang exhibition held by the Zhenping Town Houji District Cooperative for one day, in addition to recovering a portion of currency, also exchanged for 8,335 jin of wheat. In areas where organization is based, methods such as supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives signing supply and marketing contracts are adopted. According to statistics from thirteen joint cooperatives in Xinxiang Special District: a total of 33,682 jin of fertilizer, 65 bolts of cloth, and 81 heads of livestock were supplied to 173 agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and 38,794 jin of wheat were purchased, ensuring the over-fulfillment of the wheat purchasing task and supporting farmers' expanded production investment. This invigorated the urban and rural economy and promoted the development of industry and agriculture.

    河南国营贸易、合作社等部门
    组织地方工业手工业货源
    河南省国营贸易、合作社等部门在收购农作物工作中，大力组织地方货源，向手工业委托加工、订货，扩大供应，已获得显著成绩。
    前一个时期，由于河南省国营贸易、合作社等部门干部对广大群众日益增长的购买力估计不足，盲目压缩库存，以致在麦收后，形成主要商品普遍脱销。六月份，据国营贸易公司、合作社等十四个单位不完全统计：脱销肥料、农具等一百七十种，各种纱布脱销达六十七种。这不仅影响了小麦收购工作，且影响农民对生产的投资，引起农民不满。
    为解决上述问题，中共河南省委、省财政经济委员会已召集有关单位进行了讨论，重新修订下半年社会商品流转计划，同时决定省内工业适当的增加生产，供销合作社扩大肥料、农具的经营。在组织货源，扩大供应方面：
    一、就地采购、就地加工、就地供应。省花纱布公司七月份已在郑州、开封、安阳等地加工和收购布匹，基本解决了布匹脱销的问题。同时由于手工业产品占农村供应比重很大，因此在组织手工业货源方面，省合作社在全省的零售计划比去年同期扩大百分之一百一十点四。其中省、专区批发业务经营的生活资料由百余种扩大为地方工业、手工业及省外工业商品两百多种。关于肥料、农具等生产资料的加工数量也很大。专区、县贸易公司和供销合作社，也开始与手工业加强联系、进行加工订货。
    二、加强外区调拨、采购与内部合理调剂。关于外地采购方面，七月份省花纱布公司从上海、山东、江苏、北京等地调入三十余万匹布。省合作社在上海采购大批袜子、布匹、毛巾、被面等，另外还采购了一批胶鞋、面盆等。同时国营贸易系统与合作社内部进行了合理调剂，克服了某些商品甲地脱销，乙地积压的不合理现象。
    为了及时把物资供应给消费者，国营贸易部门和合作社比较普遍地采用了送货下乡、以货换粮、在集镇和乡村开展小型物资交流会及商品展览会等供应方法；这样做的好处是灵活方便，不误农时，有钱的用钱买，有粮的用粮换。如镇平镇侯集区合作社在郭庄开展览会一天，除回笼一部分货币外，还换回小麦八千三百三十五斤。在组织起来有基础的地区，采用了供销合作社与农业生产合作社订立供销合同等方法。据新乡专区十三个联合社统计：共供应一百七十三个农业生产合作社、互助组肥料三万三千六百八十二斤，布六十五匹，牲口八十一头，收购小麦三万八千七百九十四斤，保证了收购小麦任务的超额完成，支持了农民的扩大生产投资。这样就活跃了城乡经济，促进了工农业的发展。
