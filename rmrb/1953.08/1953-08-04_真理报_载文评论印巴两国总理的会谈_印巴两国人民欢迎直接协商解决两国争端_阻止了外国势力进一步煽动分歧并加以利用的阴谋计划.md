(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd) TASS Moscow, 1st: "People's Daily" published an article by I. Alexandrov, commenting on the meeting between Nehru and Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali held in Karachi, which ended on July 27th. The two Prime Ministers discussed long-standing disputes between the two countries that often lead to serious conflicts or even hostile acts.

Alexandrov wrote: The main issue they discussed was the Kashmir issue, which had been used by selfish foreign forces to sow discord, and even to cause military conflicts between India and Pakistan. Newspapers in both countries pointed out that the fact that the heads of government of the two countries held direct talks was a pleasant thing. For six years, the peace-loving people of both countries have watched with trepidation the attempts by foreign forces to spread deep discord and hatred among them. Therefore, the news of the talks cannot but make them feel satisfied.

Alexandrov recounted: Since 1947, that is, since the partition of India into India and Pakistan, the imperialists have tried every means to cause discord and conflict between India and Pakistan, thereby weakening the two countries and forcing them to seek external "assistance."

The Kashmir issue has gradually become the main trump card they use in these conspiracies.

Alexandrov continued: If the people of Kashmir could have the right and opportunity to freely express their will and decide their own destiny, this issue might have been resolved long ago. But this is not in line with the wishes of the United States, which wants to turn Kashmir into a military and strategic base for the United States at all costs. Under pressure from the United States, the Kashmir issue was brought to the United Nations, where it was shelved. In a speech at a rally in Delhi in May of this year, Nehru stated that he firmly believes that foreign interference is the only factor complicating the Kashmir issue.

After pointing out that both Prime Ministers believed that the outcome of the talks was positive, Alexandrov said: However, the Kashmir issue is far from resolved. Alexandrov wrote: Obviously, such a complex problem cannot be solved immediately without effort; but the Karachi talks showed that such problems can be solved if there is sincerity towards each other.

In a statement issued after the talks, Nehru and Muhammad Ali stated that both sides demonstrated a sincere desire to ensure success.

Alexandrov concluded: The talks between Nehru and Muhammad Ali will undoubtedly help resolve the differences between India and Pakistan and prevent foreigners who want to further incite these differences from implementing their plans. This meeting violated the will of the enemies of peace and was arranged by themselves without "mediators." The Karachi talks are a victory for the proposition of direct consultations between the parties concerned, which is the only way to resolve all international problems and disputes in our time.

    “真理报”载文评论印巴两国总理的会谈
    印巴两国人民欢迎直接协商解决两国争端
    阻止了外国势力进一步煽动分歧并加以利用的阴谋计划
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：“真理报”刊载了伊·亚历山德罗夫所写的一篇文章，评述尼赫鲁与巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里在喀喇蚩举行的并已于七月二十七日结束的会谈。两位总理讨论了两国之间长期存在的常常促成两国严重纠纷或甚至敌对行为的争端。
    亚历山德罗夫写道：他们讨论的主要问题是克什米尔问题，这个问题曾被私心的外国势力利用来播弄是非，甚至于曾引起印度和巴基斯坦间的军事冲突。这两国的报纸指出：两国政府的首脑直接举行会谈，这件事就是令人愉快的事情，两国爱好和平的人民六年以来一直怀着恐惧的心情注视着外国势力在他们中间散播深刻的不和与仇恨的企图，因此，会谈的消息不能不使他们感到满意。
    亚历山德罗夫追述：自从一九四七年以来，也就是自从印度分治成为印度和巴基斯坦两国以来，帝国主义者想尽了办法引起印度与巴基斯坦的不和，使他们发生冲突，从而削弱这两个国家，使它们不得不寻求外界的“援助”。
    克什米尔问题渐渐成为他们在这些阴谋中加以利用的主要王牌。
    亚历山德罗夫继续写道：假使克什米尔人民能有权利和机会自由地表明他们的意志，并且自己解决自己命运的话，这个问题可能老早已经解决。但是这是不合美国的心意的，它无论如何总想把克什米尔变成为美国的军事和战略基地。在美国的压力下，克什米尔问题被提到联合国，在那里，这个问题被搁置下来了。尼赫鲁在今年五月在德里的一个集会上演说时，表示他坚决认为外国干涉是使克什米尔问题复杂化的唯一因素。
    亚历山德罗夫在指出这两位总理都认为这次会谈的结果是积极的之后说：但是，克什米尔问题还谈不到已经解决。亚历山德罗夫写道：很明显，这种复杂问题不能够毫不费力地立刻解决；但是喀喇蚩会谈说明，假使互相有诚意的话，这种问题是能够解决的。
    尼赫鲁与穆罕默德·阿里在会谈结束后所发表的声明中说明：双方都表现了保证成功的诚意。
    亚历山德罗夫最后写道：尼赫鲁与穆罕默德·阿里的会谈，无疑地将有助于解决印度和巴基斯坦之间的分歧，并且阻止那些想进一步煽动这种分歧的外国人实行他们的计划。这次会谈违背了和平敌人的意志，没有通过“调解人”而自己布置。喀喇蚩会谈是有关方面直接进行协商的主张的胜利，这是使我们当代一切争执中的国际问题和纠纷能得到解决的唯一方法。
