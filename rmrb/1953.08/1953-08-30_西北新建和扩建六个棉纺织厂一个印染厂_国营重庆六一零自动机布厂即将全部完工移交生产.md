Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 29th: The Guanzhong Plain cotton-producing area in Shaanxi Province is building and expanding six cotton textile factories and one printing and dyeing factory. The newly built ones include the State-owned Northwest Second Cotton Textile Factory, the State-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory, the Local State-owned Xi'an Cotton Textile Factory, and the Joint State-Private Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory. The ones with expanded equipment include the State-owned Northwest First Cotton Textile Factory and two joint state-private cotton textile factories. A total of 137,800 spindles and more than 5,000 automatic looms will be added, of which more than 50,000 spindles and more than 2,000 looms can be installed this year. After these facilities are put into production, the total number of spindles in the Northwest region will increase by two times compared with 1949, and the total number of looms will increase by 3.4 times. More than one-fifth of the abundant cotton produced in the Guanzhong area can be spun into cloth in the area to supply local people. In addition to producing ordinary cloth, these newly built and expanded textile factories will also produce twill and various brightly colored printed fabrics that have never been produced in the Northwest region, supplying the people of the entire Northwest region.

The three newly built modern cotton textile factories are distributed along the Longhai Railway, with convenient transportation. The factory buildings are all sawtooth-shaped reinforced concrete structures, which are strong and beautiful. Among them, the State-owned Northwest Second Cotton Textile Factory and the Local State-owned Xi'an Cotton Textile Factory have already started installing machines and will be put into production around the National Day. The State-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory has a construction area of approximately 100,000 square meters, and the foundation work for the factory building is currently underway, scheduled to be completed next year. The newly installed printing equipment of the Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory officially started production on August 1st, with a current daily output of 2,000 pieces of printed fabric. Its annual output will reach 1 million to 1.3 million pieces of printed fabric. The State-owned Northwest First Cotton Textile Factory, which was expanded this year, is a modern textile factory that was just completed and put into production last year. Because this factory still has some factory buildings that can be used, more than 6,000 spindles and 80 looms will be added this year. The other two cotton textile factories are old factories with very unreasonable equipment. After the expansion this year, new production capacity can be added and workers' safety and hygiene conditions can be improved. For example, the Joint State-Private Xinqin Textile Factory is building a new-style, huge factory building. After completion, more than 30,000 newly added spindles and existing equipment can be moved in together to replace the original old workshops.

The basic construction of the textile industry in the Northwest has received support from all over the country. Textile machinery manufacturing plants in Shanghai have manufactured spinning machines, automatic looms, and sizing machines for them. The Qingdao Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant has manufactured carding machines for them. The Tianjin Textile Machinery Plant has also manufactured automatic cotton openers for them. Textile machinery factories in Henan, Guizhou, and other places have also produced roving frames, baling machines, and drawing frames for them. In addition, they have also received various machine tools for repairing machinery and equipment manufactured by machine workers in the Northeast.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 29th: The newly built State-owned Chongqing 610 Automatic Loom Factory will be completely handed over to production on September 1st. The final project of the entire factory—the "distribution board" supplying electricity to the entire factory—is being installed at an accelerated pace. As soon as this equipment is installed, all the looms can be powered on.

On the eve of the transfer of the automatic loom factory to production, the workers are carefully inspecting the installed machinery and equipment. Weaving workshop workers are stepping up the installation of "warp beams" for weaving onto each new loom that is about to be started, and are configuring various tools for tending the machines.

The 610 Loom Factory project started construction on January 12th this year. In less than eight months, a cloth factory of more than 9,000 square meters has been established, and the project quality is very good. At present, the cloth factory has established a set of management organizations, and many personnel who were responsible for the construction project of the cloth factory have now been appointed as the heads of the various workshops that are about to be put into production. After this factory officially starts production, it will supply a large amount of cloth needed by the people in the Southwest region.

    西北新建和扩建六个棉纺织厂一个印染厂
    国营重庆六一零自动机布厂即将全部完工移交生产
    【新华社西安二十九日电】陕西省关中平原产棉区正在新建和扩建六个棉纺织厂和一个印染厂。新建的有国营西北第二棉纺织厂、国营西北第三棉纺织厂、地方国营西安棉纺织厂和公私合营西北印染厂；扩充设备的有国营西北第一棉纺织厂和两个公私合营的棉纺织厂。总共将增添十三万七千八百个纱锭和五千多台自动布机，其中有五万多锭子和两千多台布机可以在今年装置完毕。这些设备投入生产以后，西北全区纱锭总数将比一九四九年增加两倍，布机总数将增加三点四倍。关中区盛产的棉花，又有五分之一以上可以在本区纺织成布，供应当地人民穿用。这些新建和扩建的纺织厂除生产普通布匹外，还将生产西北区从来没有出产过的斜纹布和各种色彩鲜艳的花布，供应西北全区人民。
    三个新建的现代化棉纺织厂分布在陇海铁路沿线，交通运输很方便。这些厂的厂房都是锯齿形的钢筋混凝土结构，坚固美观。其中国营西北第二棉纺织厂和地方国营西安棉纺织厂现已开始安装机器，国庆节前后就可以开工生产。国营西北第三棉纺织厂的建筑面积约达十万平方公尺，目前正在进行厂房的基础工程，预定在明年完工。西北印染厂新装设的印花设备，已在八月一日正式生产，目前日产两千匹花布，它的年产量将达到一百万到一百三十万匹花布。今年扩建的国营西北第一棉纺织厂是刚在去年建设完成投入生产的现代化纺织厂，因为这个厂还有一部分厂房可以利用，所以在今年添设六千多个纱锭和八十台布机。另外两个棉纺织厂是旧厂，设备很不合理，今年进行扩建以后，可以增添新的生产能力，改善工人安全卫生条件。如公私合营新秦纺织厂正在兴建一幢新式的巨大厂房，完工以后就可以把新添的三万多个纱锭和原有设备一齐搬进去，代替原来的陈旧的车间。
    西北纺织工业的基本建设，得到全国各地的支援。上海市各纺织机械制造厂替他们制造了精纺机、自动布机、浆纱机。青岛纺织机械制造厂为他们制造了梳棉机。天津纺织机械厂又为他们制造了自动开棉机。河南、贵州等地的纺织机械厂也为他们生产了粗纱机、打包机和并条机。此外，他们还得到了东北的机器工人为他们制造的修理机器设备用的各种机床。
    【新华社重庆二十九日电】新建国营重庆六一零自动布机布厂将在九月一日全部移交生产。现在全厂的最后工程——供应全厂用电的“配电板”正在加紧安装，只等这项设备安装完毕，就可以通电开动全部布机。
    自动布机布厂移交生产前夕，工人们正仔细地检验已经安装好的机器设备。织布车间工人们正在加紧把织布用的“经轴”装置到每一台即将开动的崭新布机上去，并配置各种挡车用的工具。
    六一零布厂工程从今年一月十二日开工兴建，不到八个月的时间，一座九千多平方公尺的布厂已经建立起来，工程质量很好。目前，布厂已建立好了一套管理机构，许多担负布厂建设工程的人员现在已被委派为即将生产的各个车间的负责人。这个工厂正式开始生产后，将供应西南区人民需要的大量布匹。
