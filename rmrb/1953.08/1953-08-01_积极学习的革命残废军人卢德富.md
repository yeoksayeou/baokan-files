    Revolutionary Disabled Veteran Lu Defu Actively Studies
    Readers Wang Ruohua and Nan Xu wrote: Comrade Lu Defu, a model student at the First Revolutionary Disabled Veterans School of Jiangsu Province, has consistently maintained the glorious traditions and noblest revolutionary qualities of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    Comrade Lu Defu, from a poor peasant family, is currently twenty-three years old. When the flames of the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea spread to the Yalu River, he bravely joined the Chinese People's Volunteers to defend the motherland. He was infinitely loyal to the revolution and the people, and was awarded two third-class merits. He was gloriously wounded in the Battle of Huangcaoling in Korea, had his right leg amputated, and became a second-class disabled veteran. After returning to the motherland, he realized that he should master the cultural and scientific weapons in order to contribute to the economic construction of the motherland. He once said to his comrades: "Although our bodies are disabled, our minds must be healthier. We should study culture hard so as to better serve the people." After arriving at the Revolutionary Disabled Veterans School, he was never late or absent from class, regardless of hot weather, cold weather, rain or overcast days, and he never missed a class even when he was sick and unable to eat. He never interrupted his studies every morning and evening or on Sundays. Because of his diligence, his arithmetic skills were originally very poor, but soon surpassed the highest level of his classmates. In terms of language, because he diligently consulted the dictionary, practiced writing characters, and practiced writing compositions, he achieved the "champion" score in the term exam. From an article of more than two thousand words he wrote, it can be seen that after a year of hard study, he has raised himself from illiteracy to the level of elementary school graduation.

    In addition to actively studying himself, Comrade Lu Defu is also good at helping other comrades study. For example, Comrade Huang Yousheng felt pessimistic and disappointed because his brain nerves were injured during surgery, and he was willing to drop out. After his encouragement and patient help, Comrade Huang Yousheng's wrong thinking was corrected. When learning decimal compound numbers, Comrade Huang Yousheng could not carry over, so he patiently explained it again and again, until Comrade Huang Yousheng learned the ratio method and kept up with other students. In addition, he also signed a "package teaching and learning contract" with Comrade Zhu Mingsheng to help Comrade Zhu Mingsheng extract the main ideas of the language lessons, take notes, etc. In hot weather, in order to help his comrades study, he did not hesitate to give up his lunch break to explain problems to everyone on a small blackboard. He not only reversed the pessimistic and disappointed thoughts of some comrades, but also promoted the atmosphere of mutual teaching and learning.

    Comrade Lu Defu is a hero who killed the enemy on the front line, and now he is also an expert on the cultural learning front. He is continuing to advance in accordance with Chairman Mao's wise instructions to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory."

专栏：读者来信摘要

    积极学习的革命残废军人卢德富
    读者王若华、南煦来信：江苏省第一革命残废军人学校模范学员卢德富同志，一直保持着中国人民志愿军的光荣传统和最高贵的革命品质。
    卢德富同志，贫农家庭出身，现年二十三岁。当美帝国主义侵朝战火延烧到鸭绿江边时，他为了保卫祖国，英勇地参加了中国人民志愿军。他对革命对人民无限忠诚，曾经立过两次三等功，在朝鲜黄草岭战役中光荣负伤，截去右腿，成为二等甲级残废。回到祖国后，他认识到自己应该掌握文化科学武器，好为祖国的经济建设贡献出自己的力量。他曾经对同志们说：“我们身体虽然残废，但思想更要健康，应该努力学好文化，以便更好地为人民服务。”到了革命残废军人学校以后，他不管炎热酷寒或下雨阴天，上课从来不迟到早退，甚至病了不能吃饭时，也不缺一次课。不论每天早晚或星期日，他也从未间断过学习。由于他的勤奋，他的算术程度本来很差，不久便超过了同级同学的最高水平。在语文方面，因为他勤查字典，勤习字，勤练习作文，期考时他得了“冠军”的成绩。从他写的一篇两千多字的文章中，可以看出他经过一年来的刻苦学习，已把自己从文盲提高到小学毕业程度。
    卢德富同志除了自己积极学习以外，还善于帮助别的同志学习。如黄有生同志，因为动手术使脑神经受伤，感到学不进去而悲观失望，甘愿掉队。经他的鼓励和耐心帮助，黄有生同志的错误思想纠正了。当学十进复名数时，黄有生同志不会进位，他就一次又一次地耐心讲解，一直使黄有生同志学会比例法，跟上了其他学员。另外，他还和朱明生同志订了“包教包学合同”，帮助朱明生同志摘录语文课中的内容大意，做笔记等等。炎热的时候，他为了帮助同志们学习，不惜放弃午睡时间，在一块小黑板上给大家讲解问题。他不仅扭转了部分同志悲观失望的思想，而且推动了大家互教互学的风气。
    卢德富同志是前方战线上的杀敌英雄，而且现在又是文化学习阵线上的能手。他正遵循着毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的英明指示而继续前进。
