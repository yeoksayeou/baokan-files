Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 8th: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are faithfully implementing the Korean Armistice Agreement, dispatching unarmed personnel every day to actively clear dangerous objects in our demilitarized zone. From the ceasefire to August 6th, within ten days, our unarmed personnel have removed tens of thousands of landmines and many other dangerous objects from our demilitarized zone of approximately 250 square kilometers along the entire front.

The unarmed personnel of our army entering the demilitarized zone first cleared the main passages for the joint observation teams of the Military Armistice Commission; then removed the minefields that our army had planned to set up during the war and the easily discoverable minefields laid by the enemy. Now, our army is further clearing the hard-to-detect landmines and dangerous objects in complex terrain. The unarmed personnel of our army work in the demilitarized zone every day, braving the sweltering heat and heavy rain, traversing mountains and ridges. In many minefields that are not easily detected by mine detectors, they risk their lives, using long poles tied with iron hooks to detonate the landmines.

    朝中部队积极清除我方非军事区内危险物
    【新华社开城八日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军忠实执行朝鲜停战协定，每天派出非武装人员积极清除我方非军事区内的危险物。自停火时起到八月六日的十天内，我方非武装人员在全线约二百五十平方公里的我方非军事区内，已撤除地雷数万枚和许多其他危险物。
    我军进入非军事区的非武装人员首先扫清了便于军事停战委员会联合观察小组通行的主要通道；接着撤除了我军在战时有计划设置的地雷网和敌军埋设的易于发现的雷区。现在我军正在进一步清除地形复杂区中的不易发现的地雷和危险物。我军的非武装人员，每天在非军事区内冒着酷暑淫雨，翻山越岭工作。在许多用探雷器不易发现的雷区，就冒着生命危险，用长竿缚着铁钩把地雷拉响。
