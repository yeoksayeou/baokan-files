Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch from Tokyo: US Secretary of State Dulles arrived in Tokyo on the afternoon of August 8th after his talks with Rhee Syngman in Korea, and left Tokyo on the afternoon of August 9th to return to the United States. During his 24-hour stay in Tokyo, Dulles held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida and Foreign Minister Okazaki, among others. Many reports indicate that Dulles's mission to Tokyo was to personally urge the Yoshida government to accelerate rearmament after the Korean armistice.

When Dulles arrived in Tokyo, he said that he would "discuss issues of common interest" with Yoshida and Okazaki. The Kyodo News Agency's Washington-based special correspondent revealed on the 7th that the so-called "issues of common interest" were the issue of the United States using the Mutual Security Agency's "aid" to urge Japan to rearm. He quoted the opinion of "State Department officials" as saying: "Japan's defense capabilities becoming the focus of the (Dulles-Yoshida) talks is inevitable," "because there is a relatively strong opinion within the US Congress that: the application of the US Mutual Security Agency's aid regulations (to Japan) should be conditional on Japan strengthening its Security Force; therefore, Dulles will ask Prime Minister Yoshida to explain the Japanese government's defense plans, as well as the political and economic situation in Japan affecting this plan." Kyodo further quoted "Washington diplomatic circles" as revealing that because the United States had stipulated that the Yoshida government should increase the "Security Force" to 350,000 men, during the talks between Dulles and Yoshida, "the last thing Dulles asked was how many years it would take."

After Dulles left Japan, Kyodo News Agency's Tokyo dispatch on the 10th summarized Dulles's visit to Japan by saying that Dulles and Yoshida, etc., "conducted a full study of the issue of strengthening defense capabilities." Dulles particularly emphasized the importance of Japan's rapid rearmament to the United States' implementation of a "disengagement" policy in the Far East. "Dulles, who advocates strengthening defense capabilities," and "Yoshida, who advocates gradually increasing self-defense forces," "both presented their opinions." Kyodo admitted: "This is not so much a conflict of opinions as it is both sides explaining their respective positions and deepening their understanding of each other."

In order to alleviate Japanese public anti-American sentiment, Dulles announced in Tokyo on the 8th that the United States would abandon its occupation of Amami Oshima, originally belonging to Japan, based on the San Francisco Separate Treaty, so that "Amami Oshima could be reunited with Japan." At the same time, Dulles also stated: "The United States finds it necessary to maintain the powers and administrative control it currently exercises over other islands stipulated in the (San Francisco) treaty." With the entire Japan continuing to be under American military occupation, the United States "returning" Amami Oshima to Japan is obviously just a formality. An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 8th indicated that the reason the US government "returned" Amami Oshima to Japan was because the island was very "troublesome." The Associated Press said: "The people of Amami Oshima have never been fond of the administrative personnel sent by the United States, and in 1951 they held hunger strike demonstrations almost every week. In that year, approximately 140,000 residents signed a resolution demanding to return to Japanese jurisdiction." The population of Amami Oshima is approximately 220,000.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch from New York: The "New York Times" published a Tokyo dispatch by its reporter James Reston on the 7th. The dispatch, while reporting on the Japanese people's solemn commemoration on the 6th of the eighth anniversary of the American atomic bombing of Hiroshima, admitted: "The Japanese people are not only convinced that the war brought them no benefits, but the painful lessons have made them hate everything related to war."

Reston said: "The American authorities in Tokyo are attempting to implement a plan for Japan to rearm," however, "the ever-increasing demand for peace expressed at memorial services everywhere is indeed worth deep consideration by the American authorities in Tokyo."

### 杜勒斯到东京催促吉田政府加紧重新武装  “纽约时报”记者承认日本人民要求和平的情绪越来越高

    杜勒斯到东京催促吉田政府加紧重新武装
    “纽约时报”记者承认日本人民要求和平的情绪越来越高
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在朝鲜和李承晚会谈结束后，在八日下午到达东京，并在九日下午离东京返回美国。杜勒斯在东京逗留的二十四小时期间，曾和日本首相吉田和外务相冈崎等人举行会谈。许多消息表明：杜勒斯到东京的任务，是亲自督促吉田政府在朝鲜停战后加紧重新武装。
    杜勒斯到达东京时发表谈话说：他要和吉田、冈崎“会谈关于有共同利害关系的问题”。共同社驻华盛顿特派记者在七日即已透露，所谓“有共同利害关系的问题”，就是美国以共同安全署“援助”督促日本重新武装的问题。他援引美国“国务院人士”的意见说：“日本的防御力量成为（杜勒斯、吉田）会谈的中心问题是势所必然的”，“因为美国国会内部有一种意见比较有力，这就是：（对日本）适用美国共同安全署援助规定须以日本增强保安队为条件；所以杜勒斯将要求吉田首相说明日本政府的防卫计划，以及影响这个计划的日本政治经济情况”。共同社进一步援引“华盛顿外交界人士”的话透露：由于美国已规定吉田政府要将“保安队”增加到三十五万人，在杜勒斯和吉田的会谈中，“杜勒斯最后询问的一件事就是需要几年”。
    杜勒斯离开日本之后，共同社东京十日电又总结杜勒斯对日本的访问说：杜勒斯和吉田等“对于加强防御力量问题作了充分的研究”。杜勒斯特别强调日本迅速重新武装对美国在远东实行“脱身”政策的重要意义。“主张加强防御力量的杜勒斯”和“主张逐渐增加自卫力量的吉田”“同时提出了两人的意见”。共同社承认：“这与其说是意见的对立，不如说是双方各自说明了个人所处的地位，彼此加深了了解”。
    为了缓和一下日本公众的反美情绪，杜勒斯八日在东京宣布美国放弃它根据旧金山单独和约而霸占的原属日本的奄美大岛，以使“奄美大岛与日本重新合并”。杜勒斯同时又声明：“美国有必要把它在（旧金山）和约上规定的其他诸岛上目前施行的职权和管理权继续维持下去”。在整个日本继续处于美国军事占领的情况下，美国将奄美大岛“归还”日本显然只是一种形式。美联社八日东京电表明：美国政府所以将奄美大岛“归还”日本，是因为这个岛很“麻烦”。美联社说：“奄美大岛的人民对美国派去的行政人员从来没有好感，并且在一九五一年他们几乎每星期都举行绝食示威。在那一年，约有十四万居民签了决议书，要求重归日本管辖。”奄美大岛上的人口约二十二万人。
    【新华社十日讯】纽约消息：“纽约时报”七日发表了该报记者詹姆斯·赖斯顿的东京通讯，通讯在报道日本各地人民在六日沉痛地纪念美国用原子弹轰炸广岛的八周年时承认：“日本人民不仅深信战争没有给他们带来好处，而且沉痛的教训已使他们痛恨一切与战争有关的事情”。
    赖斯顿说：“东京美国当局企图使日本实现重新武装的计划”，然而，“在各地纪念会上表现出来的有增无已的要求和平的情绪，的确值得在东京的美国当局深深地考虑”。
