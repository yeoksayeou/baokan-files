Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 25th (TASS dispatch): The German News Agency reported that Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, delivered a speech at a reception welcoming the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic. He said:

    "Mr. Prime Minister, esteemed Deputy Prime Ministers, esteemed representatives of the government delegation, thank you for providing me with a preliminary report on the progress of the talks with the government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Your report has further deepened the profound impression gained by every German who is aware of their responsibility when listening yesterday to the broadcast about the communiqué of the Soviet-German talks and its supplementary protocol. We feel filled with sincere friendship and deep gratitude. We are pleased because the talks between the Soviet government and our government delegation also have extremely beneficial results for the entire German people. We are grateful to the Soviet government because the Soviet government has shown such a deep understanding of the national status of our people and has so generously expressed its willingness to assist our German Democratic Republic.

    The documents explaining the results of your talks and today's report on the talks convincingly prove the point I made in my broadcast speech: the Soviet government's note of August 15th initiated a new stage in our people's struggle for unity and peace. Germany will either become one of the most important factors in strengthening peace and security in Europe, or it will become the main European hotbed of new aggression.

    The speech of G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, spoke of this, and his speech showed that he has a very deep understanding of German history and the current situation of the German people. We hope that some political leaders in West Germany will at least show a little bit of such understanding. The reality is that German militarism, which has destroyed and is currently threatening the peace and security of European countries, has always been the gravedigger of the German nation. After two bloody world wars, the German people are unwilling to hand over their destiny to these gravediggers for a third time.

    Therefore, all nationally conscious Germans will welcome with pleasure the fact that, thanks to the generosity of the Soviet government, the Moscow talks have created new conditions for convening a peace conference, concluding a peace treaty, and restoring Germany's democratic unity. No patriotic German would now oppose East and West Germany sending representatives to hold negotiations to reach an agreement on the establishment of an all-German provisional government.

    This will enable Germany to send representatives to attend negotiations on the peace treaty. This will also create conditions for holding genuine all-German free elections. This is the only possible way to seek a solution to problems that are very important to the German people.

    Gentlemen! In Hitler's war against European countries, the Soviet people sacrificed the most lives and suffered the greatest damage. Only by remembering this can we understand how profound the selflessness and friendship of the Soviet government's decisions show to the German people. The Soviet government has abandoned all reparations, transferred the Soviet joint-stock companies to the German Democratic Republic, and reduced the expenses of the Soviet army stationed in the German Democratic Republic. Except for ordinary commercial debts, the German Democratic Republic will be completely exempt from paying the national debt owed to the Soviet Union due to the consequences of the war.

    This generosity is also reflected in the increase in friendly assistance for the sale of food, coal, rolled metal, non-ferrous metals, cotton, and other goods. We will receive a loan of 485 million rubles at an annual interest rate of 2 percent. This is truly selfless assistance. This is friendly assistance that only socialist countries will give to other countries.

    Finally, at the request of our delegation, even prisoners of war who had been convicted of crimes were generously pardoned and did not have to continue serving their sentences, except for those prisoners of war who had committed the most serious crimes against humanity. This obligates us to never allow brutal fascism to revive in Germany, fascism that turned German soldiers into criminals against the people of other countries. This is our obligation to our people and the people of Europe.

    In conclusion, I would like to point out the following: The Soviet government's note of August 15th, the communiqué on the talks between the Soviet government and the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, and its supplementary protocol make it extremely possible for the entire German people to end the current intolerable state of division, get rid of the shackles of imperialist countries, and eliminate the constant threat caused by foreign arms expansion.

    Thanks to Soviet friendship, our people will be able to achieve the democratic unity of our country, conclude a just peace treaty, and obtain national independence and sovereignty in the near future. I hope, and I believe, that there are also enough men and women in West Germany with a high degree of national consciousness who will put the interests of the entire Germany above the interests of money and profits, and above the interests of parties and religions, and help us reach an all-German agreement.

    Our decision is clear: we have chosen the path of national unity and peace!"

    在欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团招待会上
    皮克总统就苏德会谈发表演说
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林二十五日电：德意志通讯社报道，德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克在欢迎德意志民主共和国政府代表团的招待会上发表演说，他说：
    “总理先生，各位副总理先生，敬爱的政府代表团的各位代表，感谢诸位向我初步报告了与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府进行会谈的经过。诸位的报告更加加深了每一个意识到他们的责任的德国人昨天在收听关于苏德会谈公报以及其附加议定书的广播时获得的深刻印象。我们感到充满一种真诚的友谊与深深的感激心情。我们高兴，因为苏联政府与我们政府代表团之间的会谈对于全体德国人民也有极为有利的结果。我们感激苏联政府，因为苏联政府对于我国人民的民族地位表现了如此深刻的了解，并如此慷慨地表示愿意援助我们德意志民主共和国。
    说明你们会谈结果的文件以及今天关于会谈的报告令人信服地证明了我在广播演说中所说明的一点，即：苏联政府八月十五日的照会在我国人民争取统一与和平的斗争中开始了新的阶段。德国或者是成为加强欧洲和平与安全的最重要的因素之一，或者是成为新侵略的主要欧洲温床。
    苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫的演说中谈到了这一点，他的演说说明他对德国的历史以及德国人民的目前情况有十分深刻的了解，我们希望某些西德的政治领袖们至少也该表现出有一点点这样的了解。实际的情况是：在过去破坏了、在目前又威胁着欧洲各国的和平与安全的德国军国主义一直就是德国民族的掘墓人。经过了两次血腥的世界大战后，德国人民不愿意第三次再把自己的命运交到这些掘墓人手中。
    因此，所有具有民族觉悟的德国人都会以愉快的心情欢迎这个事实，即：由于苏联政府的宽洪大量，莫斯科会谈已为召开和会、缔结和约与恢复德国的民主统一创造了新的条件。任何爱国的德国人现在都不会反对东西德派代表举行谈判以达成成立全德临时政府的协议。
    这将使德国能派代表出席关于和约的谈判。这也将为举行真正的全德自由选举创造条件。这是求得解决对德国人民非常重要的问题的唯一可能途径。
    各位先生！在希特勒对欧洲国家进行的战争中，苏联人民牺牲的生命最多，遭受的破坏最大。只有记住这一点，才能了解苏联政府的决定对德国人民表现了多么深厚的无私和友谊。苏联政府放弃了所有的赔偿费，把苏联股份公司的企业移交给德意志民主共和国，减少了苏军驻德意志民主共和国的费用。除了普通的商业债务外，德意志民主共和国将全部免付由于战争后果对苏联积欠的国债。
    这种慷慨也表现在增加售与粮食、煤、压延金属、有色金属、棉花和其他货物的友谊援助中。我们将按年利百分之二得到四亿八千五百万卢布的贷款。这是不图私利的真正援助。这是只有社会主义国家才会给予其他国家的友谊援助。
    最后，应我们代表团的请求，甚至那些因犯有罪行而被判罪的战俘也得到慷慨的赦免，不必再继续服刑，仅仅那些对人类犯有最严重罪行的战俘除外。这使我们有义务永远不使残暴的法西斯主义再在德国复活，法西斯主义使德国军人成了反对其它国家人民的罪犯。这就是我们对我国人民和欧洲人民的义务。
    作为总结，我愿意指出以下几点：苏联政府八月十五日的照会，关于苏联政府与德意志民主共和国政府代表团之间的会谈的公报以及其附加议定书使得全体德国人民极有可能来结束目前的不可忍受的分裂状态，摆脱帝国主义国家的束缚，并消除由于外国的备战而产生的经常的威胁。
    由于苏联的友谊，我们的人民能在最近的将来实现我们国家的民主统一、缔结公正的和约，并得到民族独立与主权。我希望，我相信在西德也有足够的男女具有高度的民族意识，会把全德的利益放在钱袋与利润的利益，党派与宗教的利益之上，并帮助我们达成全德协议。
    我们的决定是明显的：我们选择了国家统一与和平的道路！”
