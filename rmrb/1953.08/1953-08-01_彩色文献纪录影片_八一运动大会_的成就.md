    The sports meet celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" held in the capital last August 1st has been jointly produced by Beijing Film Studio and the Chinese People's Liberation Army Film Studio as a color documentary. Thanks to the conscientious and diligent work of the editors, directors, photographers, and all the staff involved in this film, the film vividly and graphically recorded the entire picture of the sports meet celebrating the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st," profoundly reflecting the spirit of the meeting. Therefore, this film is successful and deserves congratulations.
    This sports meet was conducted under the guidance of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's thought of "Develop sports and strengthen the people's physique" and "Train ourselves to have iron physiques to defend our most beloved country." As expressed in the film, Commander-in-Chief Zhu clearly pointed out the task of the meeting in his opening speech: "To review the achievements of the troops in cultural education, sports, military technology, and literary and artistic activities, promote the advantages, exchange experiences, in order to powerfully promote the training of the troops." And he called on the People's Liberation Army to "further develop towards complete regularization and modernization on the basis of the existing rich experience, and shoulder the glorious task of defending the motherland and defending peace." The film vividly expresses this idea through a series of color pictures. From the film, we can see: the magnificent and beautiful capital, the bright morning glow, and from the sky, the Xian Nong Tan Stadium, like a colorful patterned brocade. We can also see the scene where the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation, specially invited back to participate in the meeting, was enthusiastically welcomed by people from all walks of life in the capital. People lifted up the Volunteer Air Force heroes Zhang Jihui, Liu Yuti, and Zhao Baotong, with thousands of hands reaching out to them, showing the infinite love of the people of the motherland for the Volunteer heroes. The film shows the solemn and majestic march-in ceremony, with Commander-in-Chief Zhu reviewing the strong athletes from all directions of the motherland, from the sky and the sea, showing the rapid development of the People's Liberation Army towards regularization and modernization. The film introduces the Czechoslovakian Army Song and Dance Ensemble coming to our capital to participate in the congratulatory performance of the "August 1st" Sports Meet, and also introduces the famous Polish basketball team's tense friendship match with the "August 1st" basketball team at the meeting. It not only recorded the excellent results of various sports competitions, but also vividly recorded various equestrian, horse racing, motorcycle, and aviation sports stunts, showing the bravery and enterprising spirit of the People's Liberation Army, as well as their resourcefulness, high degree of organization, and discipline. The film also recorded the excellent programs that won awards in the literary and artistic review of the conference. These programs demonstrate the great achievements of the troops in carrying out combat-oriented, mass-based literary and artistic activities. All this shows that our Chinese People's Liberation Army, since its establishment, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, has always attached importance to the troops' cultural and sports activities. Especially today, as we enter the construction of regularization and modernization, the entire army is universally carrying out cultural education and developing the great achievements of sports and literary and artistic activities. The film vividly and graphically summarizes the entire picture of the conference's combat-oriented, mass-based cultural and artistic activities and sports activities, more profoundly reflecting the "enterprising spirit, learning spirit, discipline spirit, and the spirit of unity and friendship" of the conference, reflecting the fine traditions of our People's Liberation Army, and showing the noble virtues of our troops' sports.
    The reason for the success of this film is that the editors and photographers correctly expressed the characteristics of our Chinese People's Liberation Army's sports meet. The athletes are from the working people and soldiers who have been tempered in combat for a long time. The film prominently introduces Yi Taotege, the representative of the North China Military Region who won first place in the 5,000-meter race, who is a herdsman running on the Mongolian grasslands. It introduces Wu Yuanjin, the representative of the East China Military Region who won first place in the long jump, who was a combat hero who, in a certain battle during the Liberation War, led three soldiers with a light machine gun to repel three counterattacks from an enemy battalion. It introduces the athletes participating in cross-country horse racing, who are also soldiers of the People's Liberation Army cavalry who have been galloping on the grasslands and have been tempered in combat for a long time.
    In the film, we see the pleasant situation of athletes, members of the song and dance troupe, and soldier literary and artistic representatives studying and learning from each other in the beautiful Temple of Heaven camp. In the weightlifting competition and grenade throwing, we can also see the new sports ethics and qualities of athletes helping each other, exchanging experiences, and winners not being arrogant and losers not being discouraged.
    This film, especially the scenes showing aviation sports, is very exciting. For example, the filming of vivid scenes such as pilots performing various stunts in airplanes and male and female flight athletes performing parachute jumps requires the use of various relatively complex techniques in photography to truly and vividly capture these fast-moving scenes. This is due to the careful arrangement of the editors, but more importantly, our photographers have studied the business, learned and mastered the technology of aerial photography, and boldly filmed various stunt flight performances in the sky, forming vivid and beautiful pictures.
    The shortcoming of the film is that the editors and photographers are not familiar enough with military sports life, so they did not fully record the wonderful and moving situations of military sports programs, such as the performance and competition of water sports are not well presented. In this all-army combat-oriented mass literary and artistic review, there were indeed many wonderful programs that showed that they served the needs of combat, closely cooperated with the current military and political tasks, and some of them reached a certain level in art in the song and dance programs, which the film failed to introduce.
    Overall, this is still a very meaningful color documentary. Because it more deeply and vividly expresses the spirit of the "‘August 1st’ Sports Meet," it will encourage commanders and fighters of all units and services of our People's Liberation Army to "carry out the sports and cultural activities of the entire army in a planned and step-by-step manner along the correct direction," according to the instructions of Commander-in-Chief Zhu. For the national people's sports, cultural, and artistic activities, it will also further encourage the people of the whole country to widely carry out mass sports, cultural, and artistic activities.

    彩色文献纪录影片“‘八一’运动大会”的成就
    陈沂
    编导：司徒慧敏  导演：王为一、谭友六  总摄影师：鲁明  北京电影制片厂和中国人民解放军电影制片厂联合出品
    去年八月一日在首都举行的庆祝中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会，已经由北京电影制片厂与中国人民解放军电影制片厂联合摄制成彩色文献纪录片。由于参加这部影片工作的编辑、导演、摄影师和所有的工作人员认真刻苦的劳动，影片生动而形象地纪录了庆祝中国人民解放军“八一”建军节二十五周年体育运动大会的全貌，深刻地体现了大会的精神。所以这部影片是成功的，值得祝贺的。
    这一次运动大会是在毛主席和朱总司令所指示的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”、“锻炼自己成为铁的体质，保卫我们最可爱的国家”思想指导下进行的。正如影片中所表现的，朱总司令在开幕词中明确指出大会的任务：“就是检阅部队关于文化教育、体育运动、军事技术和文艺活动的成绩，发扬优点，交流经验，以便有力地推动部队的训练。”并号召人民解放军在“已有的丰富经验的基础之上，坚定不移地进一步向完全正规化、现代化发展，肩负起保卫祖国，保卫和平的光荣任务。”影片是通过一幅一幅的彩色图画，形象地表现了这一思想的。从影片中我们可以看到：雄伟美丽的首都，灿烂的朝霞，从天空看到，如彩色图案织锦的先农坛运动场。还可以看到大会特别邀请回国参加大会的中国人民志愿军代表队受到首都各界人民狂热欢迎的场面。人们把志愿军空军英雄张积慧、刘玉堤、赵宝桐抬起来，千万只手伸向他们，显示出祖国人民对志愿军英雄们无限的热爱。影片表现了庄严雄伟的入场式，朱总司令检阅了来自祖国四面八方，来自天空、海洋，体质强壮的健儿，表现出人民解放军迅速向正规化、现代化的发展。影片介绍了捷克斯洛伐克军队文工团来我国首都参加“八一”运动大会的祝贺表演，也介绍了著名的波兰篮球代表队在大会上和“八一”篮球队紧张的友谊赛。它不仅纪录了各项体育比赛优异的成绩，而且生动地纪录了各种马术、赛马、摩托车、航空体育的特技表演，表现了人民解放军的勇敢、进取的精神，以及他们的机智、高度的组织性和纪律性。影片还纪录了大会文艺检阅得奖的优秀节目。这些节目显示出部队在开展战斗性、群众性文艺运动的巨大成绩。这一切都说明了我们中国人民解放军自建军以来，在毛主席和朱总司令领导下，一向重视部队文化体育活动。特别是进入正规化、现代化建设的今天，全军正在普遍进行文化教育，发展体育文艺活动的巨大成绩。影片生动而形象地概括了大会战斗性、群众性文化艺术活动和体育活动大检阅的全貌，比较深刻地体现了大会的“进取的精神，学习的精神，纪律的精神，以及团结友爱的精神”，反映出我们人民解放军的优良传统，显示了我们部队体育运动的崇高美德。
    这部影片之所以成功，是由于编导与摄影师正确地表现了我们中国人民解放军的运动大会特点。运动员是来自劳动人民和久经战斗锻炼的战士。影片突出地介绍了获五千公尺赛跑第一名的华北军区代表伊套特格，他是奔跑在蒙古草原的牧人。介绍了跳远第一名的华东军区代表吴愿金，他是在解放战争时某次战斗中，和三个战士带着一挺轻机枪打退敌人一个营三次反扑的战斗英雄。介绍了参加越野赛马的运动员，也就是曾奔驰在草原上，久经战斗的人民解放军骑兵部队的战士。
    在影片中，我们看到在风景美丽的天坛营地，运动员们、文工团员们、战士文艺代表们在互相研究、互相学习的愉快情形。在举重比赛和投弹时，我们也可以看到运动员们互相帮助、交谈经验，胜者不骄、败者不馁的新体育道德和品质。
    这部影片，特别是表现航空体育的场面是十分精彩的。如影片中飞行员驾驶着飞机进行各种特技表演，男女飞行运动员跳伞表演等生动场面的拍摄，都需要使用摄影上各种比较复杂的技术，才能将这些快速度运动场面，真实地、生动地拍摄下来。这一方面是由于编导的精心安排，更重要的是我们的摄影师们钻研业务、学会而且掌握了航空摄影的技术，大胆地把天空各种特技飞行表演拍摄下来，构成生动而美丽的图画。
    影片的缺点是编导与摄影师对于军事体育生活不够熟悉，因此，也就没有把军事体育节目精彩、动人的情况充分纪录下来，如水上运动的表演和比赛是表现得不够的。这次全军战斗性群众性文艺检阅中，确有许多精彩节目，表现得服从了战斗的需要，紧密地配合了当前军事政治任务，在艺术上，其中有一些是达到了一定水平的歌舞节目，影片未能介绍出来。
    总起来说，这还是一部极有意义的彩色文献纪录片。由于它较深刻地、生动地表现了“‘八一’运动大会”的精神，因此它将鼓励我们人民解放军各部队各兵种的指挥员和战斗员们，按着朱总司令的指示，“全军的体育文化活动，循着正确的方针，有计划、有步骤地开展起来。”对于全国人民体育文化艺术活动来说，也会更加鼓舞全国人民，广泛开展群众性的体育、文化艺术活动。
