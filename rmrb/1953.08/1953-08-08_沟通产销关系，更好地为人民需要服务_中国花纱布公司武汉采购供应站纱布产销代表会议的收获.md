Communicating Production and Sales Relationships to Better Serve the Needs of the People
—Gains from the Yarn and Cloth Production and Sales Representatives Meeting of the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation Wuhan Purchasing and Supplying Station

Bing Chen

Currently, the biggest problem in the state-owned commercial sector's yarn and cloth business is that seasonably marketable goods are out of stock, while large quantities of locally processed cloth and plain white and blue cloth have not been sold. In the sixteen months from January 1952 to April 1953, the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation Wuhan Purchasing and Supplying Station consistently held over 400,000 bolts of cotton cloth in excess of reasonable inventory. The station's inventory in April this year increased to three and a half times the reasonable inventory, of which locally processed cloth accounted for 71 percent. In terms of categories, plain white and blue cloth accounted for 70 percent. In terms of quality, substandard cloth accounted for 17 percent. The masses said the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation was a "Black, White, and Blue Company" and a "Substandard Cloth Company."

The reasons for the above situation are, on the one hand, that the sales departments do not understand the needs of the people and blindly process and transfer goods; on the other hand, the production departments have failed to improve the quality of products well according to the needs of the people.

In order to communicate and strengthen the connection between production and sales, study and improve the variety and quality of yarn and cloth production, and expand sales to meet the needs of the people, the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation Wuhan Purchasing and Supplying Station, under the leadership of the central group composed of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Central and Southern District, the Finance and Economics Committee of Wuhan City, various industrial and commercial administrative departments, and related enterprise departments (a total of thirteen units), convened a yarn and cloth production and sales representatives meeting. Representatives attending the meeting included cotton cloth salespersons from the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation, department stores, retail companies, and cooperatives, as well as representatives of workers, technicians, and management personnel from textile mills, dyeing factories, and small weaving factories. In conjunction with the production and sales representatives meeting, an exhibition was also held, displaying all yarn and cloth samples (large and small) and specifications, quality, and price descriptions. In addition, charts and cartoons were used to expose the losses caused by the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation Wuhan Purchasing and Supplying Station's poor business operations in the past. At the same time, the substandard cloth and yarn produced by Wuhan's textile, weaving, and dyeing factories due to their focus on output regardless of quality, as well as the corresponding loss figures, were also displayed in kind. Through the production and sales meeting and the exhibition, the following gains were achieved:

I. Everyone clearly recognized that serving consumers is the common task of both production and sales.

In the past, there were many opinions and even mutual complaints between production and sales. In terms of sales, there was often insufficient understanding of the consistency between serving producers and serving consumers. They believed that consumers were unwilling to buy locally processed cloth, and if they promoted locally processed cloth, although it was serving producers, it was not serving consumers. A representative from a China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation store said, "In the past, we were indifferent to the promotion of locally processed cloth, and we were unwilling to even unpack the packages when the goods arrived." After discussion at the meeting, everyone believed that sales departments should not only strive to sell processed goods, but also reflect the needs and interests of consumers and the sales situation of products to producers at any time, so that producers can produce high-quality and inexpensive goods according to the needs of the people, thus unifying serving consumers and serving producers. In terms of production, there was insufficient clarity on how to serve consumers in the past. Production focused on increasing output and did not pay attention to improving quality. A worker representative from the First Yarn Factory said, "In the past, we always thought that the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation inspected too strictly. Later, we received a letter from a farmer saying, 'We gave you our good cotton, but you produced such bad cloth.' We were shocked. After seeing the exhibition and listening to everyone's opinions this time, we realized that we should improve quality and better serve consumers." Through the meeting, both production and sales unanimously agreed that consumers' needs are gradually increasing and changing. Only when production and sales work together to serve consumers can the needs of the people be met. This ideological consensus paved the way for improving the relationship between production and sales in the future.

II. Recognized the characteristics of rural and urban consumers' needs and established confidence in promoting locally processed cloth

In the past, the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation, from top to bottom, believed that Wuhan-processed cloth was a big burden. At the meeting, all the salesperson representatives conducted a comparative study of the quality and price of existing commodities and criticized the "famous brand" mentality. Finally, everyone unanimously believed that although Wuhan products are generally not as good as Shanghai products, some commodities, such as Central and Southern fine cloth and bleached cloth, can be compared with East China products, and individual commodities, such as Central and Southern fine twill and Central and Southern brown cloth, are even better than East China products. Although some commodities are not as good as East China products in terms of quality, they are low in price, and there is still a future as long as efforts are made to improve them.

The meeting further analyzed the different needs of rural and urban consumers and dispelled the concerns of sales workers. Everyone believed that it is not that locally processed cloth is completely unwanted, but only that the people's material and cultural levels have improved, and some people's requirements for the variety and quality of cotton cloth have changed. However, in the vast rural areas, the demand for plain white and blue cloth is still very large. Representatives from the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation in various parts of Hubei Province generally reflected that the sales volume of plain white and blue cloth still accounts for a very important proportion in various regions. After participating in the meeting and visiting the commodity exhibition, representatives from various parts of Hubei Province successively proposed numbers of goods they wanted. The Fancheng China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation originally planned to order 1,000 bolts of Shanghai white cloth and 500 bolts of Wuhan white cloth. After the visit and meeting, it changed to ordering all Wuhan cloth. This meeting not only promoted the locally processed cloth, but also established everyone's confidence in promoting locally processed yarn and cloth.

III. Exposed shortcomings in business management and pointed out the direction for improving yarn and cloth business

The meeting identified three shortcomings in the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation's business management:

(1) Failure to understand the needs of the people and lack of foresight and planning in work. Salesperson representatives said: "In 1951, people wanted plain white and blue cloth, but you promoted floral cloth and advised people to buy floral cloth for linings; now that people want floral cloth, you insist on promoting plain white and blue cloth." Representatives from the production departments also pointed out: The China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation's processing work always lags behind seasonal needs. They often only try to weave summer goods when summer comes and try to weave autumn goods when autumn arrives. By the time they are processed in large quantities, the season has passed, and they have to be put in the warehouse. Therefore, processing personnel said: "We are out of stock every day, rushing to complete processing tasks every day, and at the same time, we are also accumulating stock every day." Representatives from small weaving factories generally reflected: "Processing for the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation is always as urgent as fire when a task comes, and everyone stops working when the task is completed." Lack of planning in advance and temporary overtime work can easily produce substandard cloth, affect workers' health, and cause worker dissatisfaction. Secondly, the product specifications do not meet the needs of the people. Many processed cloths are too bad for face cloths and too good for linings. The China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation's processed cloths have "simple varieties and complex specifications." For example, there are sixteen types of vulcanized blue cloth, eleven types of gray cloth, and seventeen types of twill. According to salespersons, in fact, each color of cloth only needs to have upper, middle, and lower grades. The China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation lacks floral cloth, which should have complete varieties and more patterns. For example, East China checkered poplin has more than fifty patterns, but the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation only has two.

(2) Serious lack of understanding of the company's inventory. After visiting the exhibition, salespersons from the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation discovered many commodities that they had never seen before. For example, Central and Southern brown cloth, Central and Southern bleached cloth, mass blue cloth, and international mercerized plain twill, which are produced in large quantities in Wuhan, have never been sold in stores. When customers come to buy mass blue cloth, the salespersons say, "We don't have it," and turn the customers away.

(3) Due to insufficient internal and external communication, the losses caused to the state are also very serious. Representatives from the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation in various parts of Hubei Province unanimously believed that the purchasing and supplying station had insufficient contact with them in the past and did not inform them of the processing and inventory situation in Wuhan, resulting in supply imbalances. Representatives from Echeng, Xiaogan, Xiantao, and other places said: "Our Shuǐyuè and Worker-Peasant blue cloth have been out of stock for several months, who knew you still had so much in stock."

IV. Examined the shortcomings in the quality of processed yarn and cloth and helped producers improve product quality

The most serious problem in production at present is that there is too much substandard cloth. From January to May this year, the China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation inspected 248,390 bolts of cotton cloth from Wuhan's large weaving factories, of which 148,516 bolts were substandard. A dyeing factory representative said: "If the greige fabric in the past had been selected strictly, not a single bolt could have been used." The meeting analyzed the reasons for the substandard cloth. Representatives from various yarn factories stated that they would definitely suggest that the leadership take effective measures to reduce the production rate of substandard cloth after returning to the factory and strive to reach the standards stipulated by the central government in the short term.

Representatives from various factories expressed that they would humbly accept everyone's opinions at the meeting and put forward specific improvement plans. The China National Textiles Import & Export Corporation also stated that it would do its best to improve the allocation of raw cotton in the future and consult with the agricultural department to fundamentally solve the problem of the length and grade of raw cotton production.

This yarn and cloth production and sales representatives meeting was relatively successful. It communicated and strengthened the connection between production and sales, appropriately solved the supply disruption caused by the failure to combine production and sales, and laid a good foundation for improving the variety and quality of yarn and cloth production, promoting locally processed cloth, and better meeting the needs of the people.

    沟通产销关系，更好地为人民需要服务
    ——中国花纱布公司武汉采购供应站纱布产销代表会议的收获                                                    
    丙辰
    目前国营商业部门在纱布经营上的最大问题是：季节适销的商品脱销，大量的当地加工布及元、白、蓝布却没有销出去。中国花纱布公司武汉采购供应站一九五二年一月至一九五三年四月的十六个月中，除合理库存外，经常多存着四十多万匹棉布。该站今年四月的库存量竟增加到合理库存的三倍半，其中当地加工布占百分之七十一。以品类说，元、白、蓝布占百分之七十。以品质说，次布占百分之十七。群众说花纱布公司是“黑、白、蓝公司”，是“次布公司”。
    造成上述情况的原因，一方面是由于推销部门不了解人民的需要，盲目加工、调货；另一方面是由于生产部门未能很好地按照人民需要来改进产品的质量。
    中国花纱布公司武汉采购供应站为了沟通并加强产销之间的联系，研究改进纱布生产的品种质量，以便扩大推销满足人民需要，在中南区财委、武汉市财委及各工商行政部门、各有关企业部门共十三个单位所组成的中心小组的领导之下，召开了纱布产销代表会议。出席会议的有花纱布公司、百货公司、零售公司和合作社的棉布营业员代表，纺织厂、染厂、小型织布厂的工人、技术与管理人员代表。配合着产销代表会议，还举办了一个展览会，陈列了全部纱布的大、小样品和规格、品质、价格说明。此外，还通过图表漫画揭露了中国花纱布公司武汉采购供应站过去由于业务经营不善所造成的损失。同时也将武汉市纺、织、染厂由于只顾产量不管品质所生产的次布、次纱及损失数字，进行实物展览。通过产销会议和展览会，取得如下收获：
    一、大家明确认识了为消费者服务是产销双方的共同任务
    过去产销之间意见很多，甚至互相埋怨。在推销方面，常常对于为生产者服务与为消费者服务的一致性认识不足。他们认为消费者不愿意要当地加工布，如果推销当地加工布，虽是为生产者服务，但不是为消费者服务。花纱布公司门市部的代表说：“过去我们对当地加工布的推销漠不关心，货来了连包也不愿拆开。”经过会议讨论后，大家认为推销部门不仅要努力把加工商品推销出去，还必须把消费者的需要、兴趣和产品的销售情况随时反映给生产者，使生产者能按照人民的需要出产物美价廉的东西，这样才能把为消费者服务与为生产者服务统一起来。在生产方面，过去对于如何为消费者服务是不够明确的，生产当中偏重提高产量，没有注意到提高质量。第一纱厂的工人代表说：“过去我们总认为花纱布公司检验得太严格，后来接到农民来信说‘我们的好棉花给了你们，你们却生产出这样坏的布来。’我们这才大吃一惊。这次看了展览，又听了大家的意见，才认识到我们应该改进品质，更好地为消费者服务。”通过会议，产销双方一致认为：消费者的需要是在逐渐增长着和变化着，只有产销双方共同为消费者服务，才能满足人民的要求。这种思想上的一致为今后改善产销关系铺平了道路。
    二、认识了农村与城市消费者需要的特点，树立了推销当地加工布的信心
    过去花纱布公司从上到下都认为武汉加工布是一个大包袱。在会议上，全体营业员代表对现有商品逐一进行了比质比价的研究，批判了“名牌货”思想。最后大家一致认为，武汉产品一般虽赶不上上海货，但是也有一部分商品如中南细布、漂布等可与华东货媲美，个别商品，如中南细斜、中南酱色布比华东货还好。有些商品虽然品质不如华东货，但价格低，今后只要力求改进，还是有前途的。
    会议进一步分析了农村与城市消费者不同的需要，打破了推销工作者的顾虑。大家认为，现在并不是当地加工布完全没有人需要，只是由于人民物质文化水平提高了，一部分人对于棉布的品种、品质的要求起了变化。但在广大的农村里，对元、白、蓝布的需要量仍然是很大的。湖北省各地花纱布公司代表普遍反映，元、白、蓝布在各地的销量仍占很重要的比重。湖北各地代表在参加会议与参观了商品展览会以后，都纷纷提出要货数字。樊城花纱布公司原计划要上海白布一千匹，武汉白布五百匹，经过参观、会议后，改为全部要武汉布。在这个会议上，不仅推销了当地的加工布，而且树立了大家关于推销当地加工纱布的信心。
    三、揭露了经营管理上的缺点，为改善纱布经营指出了方向
    会议检查出花纱布公司在经营管理上的三个缺点：
    （一）不了解人民需要，工作中缺乏预见性与计划性。营业员代表说：“一九五一年人民要元、白、蓝布，你们却推销花布，劝人买花布做里子；现在人民要花布，你们却偏要推销元、白、蓝布。”生产部门的代表们也指出：花纱布公司的加工工作总是落在季节需要的后面，往往是夏季来了才试织夏季货，秋天到了才试织秋季货，等到大量加工出来，季节已过，只好送进仓库里放着。因此，加工人员说：“我们是每天在脱销，每天在赶加工任务，而同时每天也在积压。”小型织布厂的代表普遍反映：“给花纱布公司加工，常常是任务一来，急如星火；任务一完，大家停伙。”事前无计划，临时加班加点，一方面容易出次布，一方面影响工人身体健康，引起工人不满。其次是产品规格不适合人民的需要。有许多加工布做面子嫌坏，做里子嫌好。花纱布公司加工布“品种简单、规格复杂”。如硫化色的青布有十六种，灰布有十一种，斜纹有十七种。据营业员说，其实每种色布只要有上、中、下三等就行了。花纱布公司中品种应该齐全，花样应该多些的花色布却很少。如华东格子府绸的花色有五十余种，但花纱布公司只有两种。
    （二）不了解家底的情况很严重。花纱布公司的营业员看了展览会以后，发现很多商品是他们从未见过的。例如，在武汉大量生产的中南酱布、中南漂布、大众青布、国际丝光元斜等货，门市部从未卖过。顾客来买大众青布，营业员说：“我们没有。”便把顾客推走了。
    （三）由于内外联系不够，对国家所造成的损失也是很严重的。湖北省各地花纱布公司代表一致认为采购供应站过去与他们联系不够，没有把武汉的加工情况和库存情况告诉他们，以致发生供应失调的现象。鄂城、孝感、仙桃等地代表说：“我们的水月、工农蓝布已经脱销了几个月，谁知你们还存着这样多。”
    四、检查了加工纱布品质上的缺点，帮助生产者改进产品质量
    目前生产中最严重的问题是次布太多。今年一月至五月，花纱布公司验收武汉大型织布厂棉布二十四万八千三百九十匹，其中次布即占一十四万八千五百一十六匹。染厂代表说：“过去的胚布如果选得严格一点，一匹也不能用。”会议分析了造成次布的原因，各纱厂代表表示回厂后一定建议领导采取有效办法降低次布生产率，争取在短期内达到中央规定的标准。
    各厂代表在会上表示虚心接受大家的意见，都提出了具体的改进方案。花纱布公司也表示在今后调配原棉时要尽力加以改善，同时商请农业部门从根本上解决原棉生产的长度和品级问题。
    这次花纱布产销代表会议开得是比较成功的，它沟通和加强了产销之间的联系，适当地解决了由于产销不能结合所造成的供应脱节现象，从而为改进纱布生产的品种和质量，推销当地加工布匹，更好地满足人民需要打下了良好的基础。
