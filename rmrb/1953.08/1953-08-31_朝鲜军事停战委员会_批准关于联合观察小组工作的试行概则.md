Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 28th - The Military Armistice Commission approved on the 28th the "Provisional Regulations on the Management, Organization, Work, and Support of Joint Observer Teams" drafted by the staff officers of both sides. The three versions of these provisional regulations were exchanged after being corrected by translators from both sides on the 25th. The main points are as follows:

I. The Military Armistice Commission, through the secretaries designated by both sides, manages the work of the Joint Observer Teams and dispatches the Joint Observer Teams.

II. Ten Joint Observer Teams are established, each team consisting of two or three field-grade officers appointed by each side, and no more than thirty staff assistants and personnel.

III. The Han River estuary is divided into two areas, and the Demilitarized Zone is divided into eight sections. The above-mentioned areas are numbered from 1 to 10. The boundaries of each numbered area may be adjusted through consultation between the secretaries of both sides, based on ease of access, topography, and other considerations for operational convenience. Each Joint Observer Team operates within the area with the same number as its team number.

IV. The various duties of the teams are performed jointly by the members of both sides of the team. The teams are not considered to have been dispatched when performing routine tasks. When investigating incidents of violation of the armistice agreement, members of both sides should have equal opportunities to collect facts and hear the testimony of witnesses.

V. The Joint Observer Teams submit weekly regular reports, special reports on investigations into violations of the agreement, and supplementary reports deemed necessary by individual teams to the Military Armistice Commission. Members of each side may draft reports separately in the formal language with which they are most familiar. The content of the reports includes all matters agreed upon, and the opinions of the members of this side regarding the matters agreed upon.

VI. The Joint Observer Teams receive logistical support from their own side within their station. The commanders of each side should provide all necessary equipment and supplies to their own team members, including transportation and communication services.

The Military Armistice Commission also approved today the "Method for Recovering Corpses from the Demilitarized Zone." This method stipulates that both sides should provide each other with and exchange materials on the locations of the graves of soldiers and unburied corpses of each side within the Demilitarized Zone, and allow a team of no more than twenty unarmed personnel, starting from September 17, 1953, to go to each agreed-upon location within the Demilitarized Zone of the other side to recover the corpses of their own personnel. In the area of each Joint Observer Team, no more than five such teams from each side are allowed at any time.

    批准关于联合观察小组工作的试行概则
    【新华社开城二十八日电】军事停战委员会二十八日批准了双方参谋人员拟订的“关于联合观察小组的管理、组织、工作与支援的试行概则”，这一试行概则的三种文本已于二十五日由双方译员校正后进行交换，其要点如下：
    一、军事停战委员会通过双方指派的秘书长管理联合观察小组的工作，及派遣联合观察小组。
    二、成立十个联合观察小组，每一小组由各方指派二或三名校级军官及不超过三十人的参谋助理与工作人员。
    三、汉江口分为两个区域，非军事区分为八个地段，上述地区冠以第一至第十的编号。各编号地区的界线得按出入的便利、地形地物及其他基于工作便利的考虑，经双方秘书长协商调整。各联合观察小组在与本组编号相同的地区内工作。
    四、小组的各种职司由小组的双方组员共同执行，各小组在执行经常性任务时不被认为已被派遣。在进行调查违反停战协定的事件时，双方组员应有同等机会搜集事实与听取证人的证词。
    五、联合观察小组向军事停战委员会提出每周的定期报告，调查违反协定事件的特别报告，及个别小组认为必需的补充报告。各方成员得以三种正式文字中最熟悉的文字分别草拟报告。报告内容包括已达成协议的全部事项，本方成员对于取得协议的各项事项的意见。
    六、联合观察小组双方组员在驻地内由本方供给后勤支援，各方司令官应提供本方组员所需之一切装备与供应，包括运输工具与通讯服务。
    军事停战委员会今天并批准了“自非军事区寻回尸体的办法”。这一办法规定双方应向对方提供和交换非军事区内各方士兵墓地及未埋葬的尸体的位置的材料，并允许由不超过二十名非武装人员组成的小组，从一九五三年九月十七日起，前往对方非军事区内每一协议的地点寻回本方人员的尸体。在每一联合观察小组的地段，在任何时期每方的此类小组不准超过五个。
