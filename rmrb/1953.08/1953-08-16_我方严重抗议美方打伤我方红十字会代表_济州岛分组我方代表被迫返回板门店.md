Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 15th: The extremely serious incident of the Chaozhong (Korean-Chinese) Red Cross representatives of the Imjin River Bridge group in the joint Red Cross team sent to provide humanitarian services to prisoners of war on the opposite side, according to the provisions of the armistice agreement, being injured by UN military police guards, shows that the UN military authorities' restrictions and obstruction of the Chaozhong Red Cross personnel have not only not stopped, but have intensified, even to the point of persecuting them physically. The people of the world cannot tolerate the UN forces' serious violation of the armistice agreement and the joint Red Cross team working agreement. The Chaozhong side lodged a serious protest with the UN forces at the August 15th meeting of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee regarding this incident, demanding that the UN forces immediately stop such barbaric and brutal acts, apologize to the injured Chaozhong Red Cross representatives, punish the perpetrators, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. The Chaozhong side is waiting for a swift and responsible reply from the UN forces with extreme anger.
The full text of the protest is as follows:
	"According to the report of our chief representative of the joint Red Cross team coordination group, our representative of the Imjin River Bridge group of the joint Red Cross team South group was injured in the chest and legs by the guards who should have been protecting them. This is an extremely serious incident. It shows that your military authorities' restrictions and obstruction of our Red Cross personnel have not only not stopped, but have intensified and even physically harmed them. This is a serious violation of the armistice agreement and the joint Red Cross team working agreement, and is also resented by the people of the world. Therefore, we lodge a serious protest with you. Your side should immediately stop this barbaric and brutal behavior, immediately apologize to our injured representatives, punish the perpetrators, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. We are waiting for your swift and responsible reply with extreme anger."
At the meeting of the Joint Red Cross Team Coordination Group, the Red Cross representatives of both sides decided to immediately send one representative each to the Imjin River Bridge to investigate the facts of the persecution of Chaozhong Red Cross personnel by the UN forces. The Chaozhong Red Cross representatives emphasized that after the investigation, the Joint Red Cross Team Coordination Group should firmly demand that the UN forces make a responsible handling of this matter. The Chaozhong Red Cross representatives also requested the Red Cross representatives of various countries on the UN side to immediately convey the Chaozhong Red Cross representatives' serious protest to the UN forces.
Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 15th: The Chaozhong representatives of the Joint Red Cross Team Jeju Island Group were forced to return to Panmunjom from South Korea on the 14th. Although the Chaozhong Red Cross representatives stayed in Jeju Island for four days, they were unable to meet with a single Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war. The US military authorities and prisoner of war camp authorities in Jeju Island did everything possible to obstruct the work of the Chaozhong representatives in visiting prisoners of war, and imposed various harsh and unreasonable restrictions on communication, transportation, translation and other issues.

    我方严重抗议美方打伤我方红十字会代表
    济州岛分组我方代表被迫返回板门店
    【新华社开城十五日电】根据停战协定的规定派赴对方向战俘提供人道主义服务的联合红十字会小组中的临津江桥分组的朝中红十字会代表，竟被联合国军警卫人员打伤这一极端严重的事件，说明了联合国军当局对朝中红十字会人员横加限制和阻挠的行为，不但未稍停止，而且变本加厉，甚至对他们的人身进行迫害。全世界人民对于联合国军如是严重破坏停战协定和联合红十字会小组工作协议的行为决不能容忍。朝中方面在八月十五日的战俘遣返委员会会议上，就此事件向联合国军方面提出严重抗议。要求联合国军方面立即停止此种野蛮残暴的行为，向被伤害的朝中红十字会代表道歉，惩办肇事的凶手，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。朝中方面正怀着极度的愤怒，等待联合国军方面迅速的负责的答复。
    抗议全文如下：
    “据联合红十字会小组协调组我方首席代表的报告，联合红十字会小组南组临津江桥分组我方代表竟被应该保护他们的警卫伤了他们的胸部和腿部。这是一个极端严重的事件。他说明你方军事当局对我方红十字会人员横加限制和阻挠的行为不但未稍停止，反而变本加厉对他们的人身进行伤害。这是对于停战协定和联合红十字会小组工作协议的严重的破坏，也是为全世界人民所共愤的。为此我方向你方提出严重抗议。你方应立即停止此种野蛮残暴的行为，立即向被伤害的我方代表道歉，惩办肇事凶手，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。我方正怀着极度的愤怒等待你方迅速的负责的答复。”
    在联合红十字会小组协调组会议上，双方红十字会代表决定立即各派代表一人，赴临津江桥就联合国军迫害朝中红十字会人员的事实进行调查。朝中红十字会代表着重指出：在调查后，应由联合红十字会小组协调组坚决要求联合国军方面对此作负责的处理。朝中红十字会代表并要求联合国军方面各国红十字会代表将朝中红十字会代表的严重抗议立即转达联合国军方面。
    【新华社开城十五日电】联合红十字会小组济州岛分组的朝中代表已于十四日被迫由南朝鲜回到板门店。朝中红十字会代表在济州岛虽然停留了四天，但却没有能够和一个中国人民志愿军被俘人员会面。济州岛美方军事当局及战俘营当局对于朝中方面代表访问战俘的工作，千方百计地进行阻挠，并在通讯、交通、翻译等问题上给了种种苛刻无理的限制。
