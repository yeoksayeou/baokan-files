Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 24th. At the meeting of the Repatriation of Prisoners of War Committee on the 24th, Li Pingyi, the chief representative of our side, demanded that the US side provide an answer to the question of detaining 250 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. According to reports from our returned captured personnel, the US side groundlessly seized many of our captured personnel who should have been directly repatriated before and after the start of the repatriation of prisoners of war. US Secretary of the Army Stevens also publicly admitted to detaining 250 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

At today's meeting, Li Pingyi questioned the US side: Your side has publicly stated that you are prepared to detain a considerable number of our captured personnel, of which at least 250 are captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Now we want to know how you are going to handle these captured personnel of our side. Your side cannot avoid answering this question. But the US side refused to answer.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 24th. The Korean-Chinese side has consistently opposed the forced detention of prisoners of war on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, and has never conducted so-called "screenings" among the UN forces prisoners of war it has accommodated. However, after the Korean-Chinese side, in accordance with the agreement between the two sides, announced the content of the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" to the UN forces prisoners of war it was accommodating, a portion of the UN forces prisoners of war immediately expressed their unwillingness to be repatriated. The Korean-Chinese side has made every effort to persuade them to return, but some people are still unwilling to be repatriated. In addition, in the current process of actual repatriation of prisoners of war, some UN forces prisoners of war, although they had not previously expressed unwillingness to be repatriated, are unwilling to return during actual repatriation. The Korean-Chinese side is also making every effort to persuade these people to return. Up to now, approximately 400 UN forces prisoners of war who have refused to listen to our side's persuasion and expressed their unwillingness to return have been discovered. At the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee meeting on August 20, the Korean-Chinese side notified the UN forces side of the above approximate number, and pointed out that because the repatriation of prisoners of war has not yet been completed, and during this period the Korean-Chinese side will continue to persuade these UN forces prisoners of war, the approximate number of UN forces prisoners of war unwilling to be repatriated may change.

    我方在战俘遣返委员会会议上
    要求美方答复扣留志愿军被俘人员的问题
    我方把不愿遣返的联合国军被俘人员概数通知对方
    【新华社开城二十四日电】在战俘遣返委员会二十四日会议上，我方首席委员李平一要求美方对扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员二百五十人的问题提出答复。据归来的我方被俘人员报告，美方在战俘开始遣返的前后，毫无理由地抓走应该直接遣返的我方被俘人员多人。美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯也公开承认扣留了中国人民志愿军被俘人员二百五十人。
    李平一在今天的会议上质问美方：你方曾公开地声称你方准备扣留相当数量的我方被俘人员，其中至少有二百五十人是中国人民志愿军被俘人员。现在我们要知道你方对我方的这些被俘人员究竟作如何处理。你方不能避不回答这个问题。但美方竟拒不回答。
     【新华社开城二十四日电】朝中方面在战俘遣返问题上一贯反对强迫扣留战俘，从不在它所收容的联合国军被俘人员中进行所谓“甄别”，但在朝中方面根据双方协议，向其所收容的联合国军被俘人员宣布“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的内容后，有一部分联合国军被俘人员即表示不愿遣返。朝中方面曾尽力劝说他们回去，然而仍有些人不愿遣返。此外，在目前正在进行的战俘实际遣返过程中，有些联合国军被俘人员事先虽无不愿遣返的表示，但在实际遣返时又不愿回去。对于这些人，朝中方面也正尽力劝说他们回去。上述这些不听我方劝说表示不愿回去的联合国军被俘人员，截至目前为止，已发现约有四百人左右。在八月二十日的战俘遣返委员会上，朝中方面已将上述概数通知联合国军方面，并指出：由于战俘遣返尚未完成，而在此期间朝中方面将继续对此等联合国军被俘人员进行劝说，因此，不愿遣返的联合国军被俘人员的概数可能有改变。
