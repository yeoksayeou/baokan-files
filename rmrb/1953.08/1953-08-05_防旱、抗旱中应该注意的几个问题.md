Several Issues to Note in Drought Prevention and Resistance

In the first half of July, most areas of East and Central South China lacked rainfall, and some areas experienced severe drought. In July and August, early rice is flowering and bearing grain, and middle rice is budding and heading. As the saying goes, "When the rice is budding, the water should be waist-deep," which is the time of urgent need for water. Therefore, striving to overcome the drought in July and August has become the key to achieving a bumper harvest of rice.

In recent years, many farmland water conservancy projects have been built in various places, which have played a great role in guaranteeing agricultural production. But why do droughts occur in many areas after only one or twenty days without rain? There are many reasons for this: in Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang and other provinces, there are some "sky-water fields" whose crop growth depends entirely on rainwater and are extremely vulnerable to drought; in some areas, the ponds and reservoirs destroyed by mountain floods have not yet been fully repaired; in a few areas, cadres and the masses are complacent, and counter-revolutionaries take the opportunity to sabotage water conservancy, and so on. However, an important reason is that there are still many problems in drought prevention work in some areas, so that the existing irrigation water sources cannot be rationally utilized and the strength of the masses has not been well brought into play.

First of all, the management of ponds and dams is not good. In some areas, there is no leadership to manage water conservancy, and there is no organization or order in water use. During periods of water shortage, everyone rushes to irrigate the fields, and those who get water try to irrigate as much as possible, resulting in great waste, while those who do not get water will suffer from drought. Therefore, disputes often occur, undermining the unity among farmers and weakening the strength of drought resistance. In other areas, after the occurrence of drought, cadres took over and established formalistic water management organizations from top to bottom, and also formulated some rules and regulations, but because they were completely unsuitable for the needs of the masses, they did not receive the support of the masses. Secondly, in organizing the masses to build water conservancy projects, jointly use water, and collectively operate waterwheels, the interests of some farmers have been infringed upon. For example, non-beneficiary households are forced to provide labor without compensation to beneficiary households to build ponds and dams, which has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among non-beneficiary households. Also, the water conservancy projects built in this way have many problems. For example, in order to collectively operate waterwheels for drought resistance, farmers' waterwheels are concentrated for public use, but no one repairs them when they are broken. According to a survey in Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, about 20 percent of the waterwheels are broken and not repaired. These are all due to the insufficient implementation of the policy of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, thus weakening the strength of drought resistance.

To do a good job in drought prevention and resistance in the future, the following issues must be noted:

1.  Vigorously implement the policy of protecting farmers' ownership and the policy of mutual assistance and mutual benefit. Cadres in various places should also implement various policies for developing agricultural production in leading drought prevention and resistance work, and should not infringe upon the interests of farmers. If waterwheels are borrowed, it is necessary to be responsible for repairing them. The issue of labor burden left over from the construction of water conservancy projects should be handled according to the principle of who benefits bears the burden. In terms of water conservancy management and water use, democratic discussions among the masses should be fully launched under the principle of benefiting production and benefiting together, and water conservancy management systems should be established or strengthened based on local actual conditions. In carrying out this work, attention should be paid to respecting and protecting farmers' water rights and good water use habits. In organizing farmers to jointly use water, many trivial problems are often encountered, which should also be solved patiently and meticulously.

2.  Summarize and appropriately promote the drought resistance experience of the masses. The masses of farmers in various places have some drought resistance methods. As long as the cadres can go deep down, discuss with the masses, summarize the drought resistance experience of the masses, and appropriately promote it, it can play an important role. Farmers in Echeng County, Hubei Province, first put a small amount of water into the cracked sandy soil fields to soak the soil, and then step on it with their feet to seal the cracks, so that the water will not leak. There are many such good experiences among the masses, which can be promoted in areas where conditions are suitable.

3.  In areas where drought has already occurred, production and drought resistance should be the overriding central task at present. Leading cadres must go deep into these areas to guide and assist local areas in carrying out drought resistance campaigns, enhance the masses' confidence in overcoming disasters, actively seek water sources, and rationally solve water use problems, so as to overcome drought and ensure a bumper harvest.

### 防旱、抗旱中应该注意的几个问题

    防旱、抗旱中应该注意的几个问题
    七月上半月，华东、中南大部地区缺雨，部分地区呈现严重旱象。七、八月份，早稻扬花结实，中稻打苞出穗，农谚“谷打苞，水满腰”，正是急切需水的时候。因此，努力战胜七、八两月的干旱，已成为争取水稻丰收的关键。
    几年来，各地兴修了很多农田水利工程，对农业生产起了很大的保证作用。但为什么只有一、二十天不落雨，不少地区就发生了旱象呢？这里面的原因是很多的：湖南、湖北、浙江等省有部分“天水田”，作物生长全靠雨水，极易受旱；有些地区山洪冲毁的塘坝水库尚未完全修复；少数地区因干部、群众麻痹大意，反动分子乘机破坏水利，等等。而若干地区在防旱工作中还存在着许多问题，以致现有的灌溉水源不能合理地加以利用，群众力量没有很好地发挥出来，也是一个重要原因。
    首先是塘坝管理不好。有些地区没有领导群众管理水利，用水没有组织和次序，在缺雨的时候，大家抢水灌田，得到水的就尽量多灌，浪费很大，得不到水的就要遭受干旱，因此常常发生纠纷，破坏了农民之间的团结，减弱了抗旱的力量。另有些地区，在旱象发生之后，由干部包办，自上而下地建立了形式主义的管理用水组织，也订立了一些规章制度，但因完全不适合群众需要，所以得不到群众的支持。其次是在组织群众兴修水利、合伙用水和集体车水当中，侵犯了某些农民的利益。例如强迫非受益户无代价地出劳力给受益户修塘坝，引起非受益户普遍不满；这样修起来的水利工程毛病也很多。又如为了集体车水抗旱，把农民的水车集中起来，大家公用，但是用坏了却无人修理。据湖南省湘乡县调查，约有百分之二十的水车坏了没有修理。这些都是由于互助互利政策贯彻不够，因而削弱了抗旱的力量。
    要作好今后的防旱抗旱工作，必须注意下列几个问题：
    一、大力贯彻保护农民所有权的政策和互助互利政策。各地干部领导防旱抗旱工作中，同样要贯彻发展农业生产的各项政策，不要侵犯农民的利益。借用水车，一定要负责修理。对兴修水利工程中遗留的劳力负担问题，应按谁受益谁负担的原则加以处理。在水利管理和用水方面，应在有利生产、共同受益的原则下，充分发动群众民主讨论，根据当地实际情况，建立或加强水利管理制度。在进行这一工作时，应该注意尊重和保障农民的用水权和优良的用水习惯。在组织农民合伙用水当中，常常会遇到许多琐碎的问题，也应耐心地细致地加以解决。
    二、总结并适当推广群众的抗旱经验。各地农民群众都有一些抗旱办法，只要干部能深入下去，和群众一道商量，总结群众抗旱经验，适当地加以推广，便能发挥重要作用。湖北鄂城县农民在裂缝的沙土田里，先放进少量的水，将土浸透，然后用脚踩一下把裂缝糊住，可以装水不漏。像这样的好的经验在群众中间是很多的，可以在条件适合的地区推广。
    三、旱象已成的地区，应以生产抗旱为当前压倒一切的中心任务。领导干部务须深入这些地区，指导和协助当地开展抗旱运动，提高群众战胜灾害的信心，积极找寻水源，合理解决用水问题，这样便能战胜干旱，保证丰收。
