A Heartwarming Piece of News

	One day in January of this year, a striking piece of news appeared on the blackboard newspaper of the Jinxi Chemical Factory: A young lathe operator from Workshop 302 of the Mechanical Branch Factory, Wei Yuxi, proposed a personal plan to exceed the work quota by 100%. The news quickly spread, and employees throughout the factory discussed it. Most employees were skeptical, because the Mechanical Branch Factory faced heavy tasks this year. The factory’s production targets had doubled compared to last year, but the number of personnel and equipment remained the same. The work quotas for many products had been raised compared to last year. For example, the quota for No. 1 flanges last year was 20 per work shift, while this year it was 27 per work shift. The quota for figure-eight wheels last year was 3.5 work shifts per wheel, while this year it was 1.7 work shifts per wheel. In this context, Wei Yuxi’s proposal to double production efficiency naturally aroused suspicion. Their products were complex and frequently changed, and each product change required re-preparation of cutting tools and familiarization with drawings. Under these circumstances, Wei Yuxi proposed to increase the machine operating time from 50% to 75%. How could this not arouse suspicion? Wei Yuxi’s lathe was an old eight-foot “sealed can” lathe left over from the Japanese puppet regime, with a maximum speed of only 305 revolutions per minute. Wei Yuxi wanted to improve it, but due to the lathe's limitations, he could only increase it to 500 or 600 revolutions per minute. Given these conditions, Wei Yuxi wanted to increase the cutting speed to 500 meters. How could this not arouse suspicion?

	Workers familiar with Wei Yuxi worriedly went to his home to ask:

	“Old Wei, are you sure? Don’t make empty promises!” Wei Yuxi replied with a smile, “Comrades, the country has begun planned economic construction. Don’t keep walking the old path step by step. Am I sure? It’s all about political consciousness plus learning from advanced Soviet experience.”

Could It Just End Here?

	When formulating the production plan this year, Wei Yuxi spent every evening at his desk writing, trying to create a personal plan to complete the state plan ahead of schedule. For this, he lost sleep for many nights, writing and tearing up drafts, never feeling satisfied. Finally, based on a remark made to him by a Soviet expert – “To increase work efficiency, one should pay close attention to shortening auxiliary time” – he carefully examined his past work and was shocked, realizing that he had not cherished time enough in the past. The average machine utilization rate in the entire branch factory was only over 40%. He was considered advanced, but his rate was only 50%. In an eight-hour workday, he was only actually working for four hours. Wei Yuxi felt that this was the key issue and must be resolved. During the day, whenever he had time, he sought out technicians to study the issue. At night, he studied the book “At High Speed,” hoping to find some clues from the experiences of the ten Soviet high-speed cutting workers. After more than a week of painstaking research, he finally came up with a scientific way to shorten auxiliary time. This method can be summarized as follows: Before processing a part, first check the drawings and raw materials, and understand the requirements for each part, so that you have a clear understanding in your mind; carefully study the processing steps and develop a reasonable construction procedure based on the different products; organize the workplace in an orderly manner, prepare the tools needed in advance, and arrange them in an orderly manner on the tool table within two meters, so that they can be easily accessed when needed, avoiding random grabbing; place the workpieces to be processed in appropriate places, and separate the finished and unfinished workpieces to save “mounting” time; fully grasp the rules of “clamping” and “aligning” to avoid wasting time due to random “clamping” and “aligning”; use the longitudinal feed dial to implement the “quick measurement method” to save measurement time. By doing this, the machine utilization rate can be increased to 75%. Wei Yuxi was extremely happy to come up with this method, and he wrote a personal plan to increase labor productivity by one-third.

	As soon as the plan was finished, Wei Yuxi wanted to lie down on the bed to sleep. When he looked up, he suddenly saw his beloved sewing machine. He stared blankly at the sewing machine for a while, then tore up the plan in a fit of pique. It turned out that this was the reason: In last year’s increase production and practice economy campaign, Wei Yuxi found thirteen tricks to increase production efficiency by 100%, and this sewing machine was bought with the bonus he received for exceeding his quota. He thought, “Last year’s increase production and practice economy increased production efficiency by 100%. Although the state plan has increased this year, this is a new period of economic construction!” Wei Yuxi had almost wracked his brains trying to formulate the plan, and now he encountered the greatest difficulty. Without specific measures to guarantee it, it was impossible to take the plan a step further. Could it just end here? Wei Yuxi’s thoughts were in turmoil. Wei Yuxi lay on the bed unable to sleep, and tossing and turning all night yielded no results.

	When he returned from work in the evening, Wei Yuxi didn’t even want to eat. He habitually sat at the table and picked up a notebook, which he had used to take notes when he attended the high-speed cutting training class in the first half of last year.

Several Things Triggered by the Notebook

	Wei Yuxi was born into a middle peasant family. His father died before he was born, and his mother died when he was six years old. He spent his childhood alone, attending elementary school in his village for six years. At the age of sixteen, poverty forced him to become an apprentice in a private iron factory, where he began to endure the exploitation of the capitalists. At the age of eighteen, he went to work as a lathe operator in a coal mine machinery workshop, enduring ruthless oppression. It was not until after the "August 15th" victory when he entered the Jinxi Chemical Factory that he found his true path in life.

	In March of last year, the state sent Wei Yuxi to a training class to study. This matter moved Wei Yuxi greatly. After returning, Wei Yuxi told everyone he met, "There was no such thing in the old society! Only a country led by the Communist Party would train workers like this." "Soviet experts are working so hard for our economic construction. How should we work?" Wei Yuxi was different from before. Once, the leadership gave Wei Yuxi a batch of tow rope wheel tasks, with a work quota of ten hours per wheel. This task had not been done before, so the quota was not very accurate. Wei Yuxi went to the planning section and said, "There is a problem with the quota for the tow rope wheels." The comrades in the planning section thought he was asking for an increase in working hours, so they said:

	"Ten hours is not too little." But Wei Yuxi said, "My opinion is that it should be reduced." The comrades in the planning section felt very surprised, because it was rare for anyone in this factory to take the initiative to request a reduction in work quotas. After research, it was reduced to five hours. In fact, Wei Yuxi only took three hours to make one, and he asked for it to be reduced to three hours. Even so, Wei Yuxi was not satisfied with his work. He felt that the working class should play a greater role in building their motherland and striving for national industrialization.

	Many past events revolved in Wei Yuxi's mind. He said to himself, "During the large-scale economic construction of the country, I need to contribute more. How can I bow my head when I encounter difficulties?" So he picked up the notebook and flipped through it, trying to find some ways to formulate a more advanced plan.

Another Idea

	Wei Yuxi checked his past work item by item. He realized that identifying past shortcomings would provide a pathway for improving future work. From the beginning of "mounting" a workpiece to finishing it, from starting work to getting off work, he thought about it back and forth several times, but couldn’t find any problems. He then opened the book “At High Speed,” and saw the following words on one page: “The efficiency of machinery should be fully utilized….” He suddenly realized, “My lathe’s efficiency is not high enough. The maximum speed is only 305 revolutions per minute, and the power is ten horsepower. Can this be improved?” The next day, during his break, he brought in technician Ding Jifei and said to him: “Old Ding, let’s dismantle this lathe and calculate how much load each component can handle. Can we increase the speed and power?” While checking, Wei Yuxi thought to himself: Soviet experts have said that Japanese-designed lathes are relatively conservative. The results of the inspection confirmed Wei Yuxi's idea. After calculation, the speed could be increased to more than 500 revolutions per minute, simply by improving the pulley. The power could be replaced with a fifteen-horsepower "motor." With this calculation, he was very confident that the cutting speed could reach more than 500 meters.

	In this way, after more than half a month, Wei Yuxi finally formulated an advanced plan to double labor efficiency.

Wei Yuxi's Glory

	April 5th was a day he would never forget. On this day, he was approved as a probationary member of the Communist Party of China. Wei Yuxi deeply realized that his responsibility was even greater and more arduous, so his enthusiasm for studying technology and learning from advanced Soviet experience became even greater. On April 19th, Wei Yuxi saw a newspaper article in the workshop office introducing Kolesov’s new method of using lathe tools, and he quickly found technician Ding Jifei to study it. "There is no detailed technical introduction, so how can we study it?" the technician worried. It was indeed a difficult task, but if they could learn it, they could increase production efficiency several times, so how could Wei Yuxi let it go? He read the introduction in the newspaper word by word, like looking for pearls, trying to find what he needed. Suddenly, he patted Ding Jifei's shoulder and said happily: "Old Ding, look, 'The larger the radius of the cutting edge corner, the smoother the surface of the processed part,' 'The main difference between Kolesov's new type of lathe tool and the ordinary outer round lathe tool is that it has an additional cutting edge.' Haven't these two sentences already pointed us in the right direction? Let's just do it according to this principle." After several days of exploration, they made a "new type of lathe tool," and the experiment was really effective. The feed rate was increased from 0.4 mm to 2 mm, but there was still a problem: the "chips" cut off were not broken, but became long strips, which greatly hindered the turning work. At this time, the April 24th newspaper published the tool drawings of Kolesov's new type of lathe tool. Wei Yuxi quickly took the drawings to Ding Jifei. The tools made this time cut off "chips" that became small hook-shaped fragments. This new achievement filled Wei Yuxi with confidence to revise his plan, increasing the machine operating time to a maximum of 85% and the cutting speed to 600 meters per minute.

	Comrade Wei Yuxi’s attitude as master of his own affairs and his active study of technology and advanced Soviet experience have significantly improved labor production efficiency: In January, he completed 235.715% of the work quota; in February, 206.15%; in March, 200.94%; in April, 222.03%; and in May, 362.62%. As of June 15th, he had completed an average of 226.465% of the work quota for the first half of the year. These achievements have earned him high honors. In May, the Liaoxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions approved him as a Liaoxi Provincial Model Worker.

Further Training and Leadership Are Still Needed

	The Jinxi Chemical Factory has achieved great results in cultivating Comrade Wei Yuxi, but there are also shortcomings. First of all, the factory leadership lacks the necessary guidance on the plan proposed by Comrade Wei Yuxi. For example, the proposal that the quality be 100% qualified, that a belt-driven lathe be transformed into an automatic lathe for cutting gasoline drum lids before National Day this year, and that the individual's cultural level be raised to the level of a senior vocational school graduate by the end of the year are not appropriate enough. Secondly, the factory leadership directly conducts work without going through the party, administrative, trade union, and youth league organizations of the branch factories and workshops, which has led to a lack of care and support for Comrade Wei Yuxi in the branch factories and workshops. Therefore, in the five and a half months from January to June 15th, due to meetings, visits, reports, and illness, Wei Yuxi's actual working time was only more than 78 days. Therefore, the leadership of the Jinxi Chemical Factory should learn from the above lessons and improve them in the future.

    韦玉玺怎样提高了劳动生产率
    一个动人的消息
    今年一月的一天中午，国营锦西化工厂厂内黑板报上，登了一个十分惹人注目的消息，大字标题是：机械分厂三○二车间青年车工韦玉玺，提出超过工时定额一倍的个人计划。消息很快的传播出去了，全厂的职工们纷纷议论起来。大多数职工都有点怀疑。因为今年机械分厂的任务是很繁重的，全厂生产任务比去年增加了一倍，而人员和设备并没有增加，许多加工品的工时定额比去年提高了，像一号法兰去年定额一工做二十个，今年则是一工做二十七个；八字轮去年定额三个半工做一个，今年则是一点七工做一个。在这个情况下，韦玉玺提出要把生产效率再提高一倍，怎么会不引起很多人的怀疑呢？因为他们的产品复杂，经常换，每换一次产品就得重新准备刀具，熟悉图纸。就是在这个情况下，韦玉玺提出要把机器开动时间由百分之五十提高到百分之七十五，这怎么会不引起很多人的怀疑呢？韦玉玺的车床是伪满遗留下来的八尺闷罐车床，最高转数才三百零五转，韦玉玺想改进一下，因限于车床能力，也只能改到五、六百转，就是在这个条件下，韦玉玺要把切削速度提高到五百公尺，这会不引起人怀疑吗？
    熟悉韦玉玺的工友很耽心地跑到他家里去问：
    “老韦，有把握吗？别放空炮呀！”韦玉玺微笑着回答说：“同志，国家开始有计划的经济建设了，别再按着老路一步一步的走了。把握吗？那就是政治觉悟加上学习苏联先进经验。”
    难道就到此为止了吗
    今年开始制订生产计划的时候，韦玉玺每天晚上回家便伏在桌子上写，想订出一个提前完成国家计划的个人计划。为了这，他多少晚上都没睡好觉，写了撕，撕了又写，总是觉得不满意。最后，他根据苏联专家给他讲过的一句话——“要想提高工作效率，应该十分注意缩短辅助时间”，于是他认真地检查了一下自己过去的工作，不禁吃了一惊，感觉到过去对时间太不爱惜了。机械利用率在全分厂来说，平均只达到百分之四十多，自己算是先进一些，可是也不过百分之五十，一天工作八小时，实际只做了四小时的活。韦玉玺感到这就是关键问题，一定要解决它。白天一有时间，他就找技术人员去研究，晚上回家就学习“在高速下”这本书，想从苏联十个高速切削工人的经验里，找到一些门路。经过一个多星期的苦心研究，他终于整理出了一条科学的缩短辅助时间的办法，这个办法写出来就是：在车一个活以前，先检查好图纸，检查好原材料，熟悉各部分加工的要求，使心里先有底；仔细钻研加工工序，根据不同的产品，制订合理的施工程序；有秩序的组织工作地点，事先准备好应用的工具，把它有次序的安排在二公尺以内的工具台上，用时顺手就可以拿来，免得乱抓；把需要加工的工作物放在适当的地方，已经加完工的要和没有加工的工作物分开放，节省“上活”时间；充分掌握“卡活”“找正”的规律，以免乱“卡”乱
    “找”，浪费时间；用纵进刀刻度盘，实行“快速量活法”，节省量活时间。这样做，机械利用率便可以提高到百分之七十五。想出了办法，韦玉玺高兴极了，他写出了提高劳动生产效率三分之一的个人计划。
    计划刚订完，韦玉玺想躺到床上去睡觉，一抬头忽然看见了他心爱的缝纫机，他发痴地望着缝纫机呆了一会，一堵气又把计划撕掉了。原来是这么一回事：去年增产节约运动中，韦玉玺找到了十三件窍门，使生产效率提高了一倍，这台缝纫机就是用超额奖金买的。他想：“去年增产节约还提高了生产效率一倍，今年虽说是国家计划提高了，可是这是经济建设新时期呀！”为了订计划，韦玉玺几乎绞尽了脑汁，现在他遇到了最大的困难。想不出具体的措施保证，是没办法再把计划提高一步的。难道就到此为止了吗？韦玉玺的思想闹起斗争来了。韦玉玺躺到床上睡不着，折腾一夜也没有个结果。
    晚上下班回来，韦玉玺连饭也不想吃了。他习惯地坐在桌子旁边，顺手拿起了一个笔记本子，这是去年上半年他在高速切削训练班学习时记的笔记。
    笔记本引起来的几件事
    韦玉玺生在一个中农家庭里，出生以前父亲就死去了，母亲把他抚养到六岁又不幸去世了。他孤苦伶仃地度过了童年，在本村里念了六年小学。十六岁那年，贫穷逼着他去一个私营铁工厂里当学徒，开始承受着资本家的剥削。十八岁又到一个煤矿机工场当车工，忍受着无情的压迫。一直到“八、一五”胜利后进入锦西化工厂，才算找到了真正的生活道路。
    去年三月，国家为了培养韦玉玺，把他送到训练班去学习。这件事使韦玉玺很受感动。回来后，韦玉玺每逢见了熟人就讲：“在旧社会那有这事呀！只有共产党领导的国家，才这样培养工人。”“苏联专家为了我们的经济建设，那样不辞辛苦，我们该怎样工作呢？”韦玉玺与前不同了。有一次领导上给韦玉玺一批拖绳轮的任务，工时定额是十小时车一个，这个活过去没做过，所以定额不太准确。韦玉玺去找计划股说：“拖绳轮的定额有问题。”计划股的同志还以为他是要求增加工时呢，就说：
    “十小时不少了。”可是韦玉玺说：“我的意见是应该减少。”计划股的同志感到很突然，因为主动要求降低工时定额的事，在这个厂里还真不多呢。经过研究降到五小时，实际上韦玉玺只用三小时就车一个，他又要求降到三小时。虽然这样，但韦玉玺对自己的工作总是不满意，他觉得工人阶级在建设自己的祖国、为国家工业化而奋斗当中，应该起到更大的作用。
    许多过去的事情，在韦玉玺的脑子里打转转，他自言自语地说：“在国家大规模经济建设中，需要我更多的出力了，那能见到困难就低头呢？”于是他拿着笔记本紧翻，想从里边找到一些办法，重新制订一个更先进的计划。
    又想出了办法
    韦玉玺一件一件地检查自己过去的工作。能够找出过去的缺点来，就给提高今后的工作找到了门路，这是韦玉玺得到的一点体会。可是从“上活”开始到车完一个活为止，从上班起到下班止，他反复想了几个来回，也没找出问题来。他又翻开了“在高速下”这本书，在有一页上他看到了这样几个字：“应该充分发挥机械效能……。”这一下他恍然大悟，“我的车床效能还不够高，最高才能开到三百零五转，动力是十马力，这不能改进了吗？”第二天趁休息时间，他把技术员丁积飞找来了，对他说：“老丁，咱们把这部车床大卸开，算一算各部构造的负荷多大，再加多转数、加大动力还行不行？”一面检查，韦玉玺一面想：苏联专家说过，日本设计的车床是比较保守的。检查的结果，肯定了韦玉玺的想法。经过计算，转数可以增加到五百转以上，只要改进一下皮带轮就可以，动力可以换上十五马力的“马达”。这样一算，切削速度达到五百公尺以上是很有把握的。
    这样，先后经过了半个多月的时间，韦玉玺终于订出了把劳动效率提高一倍的先进计划。
    韦玉玺的光荣
    四月五日，这是他永生也不会忘记的日子，就在这一天，他被批准为中国共产党候补党员了。韦玉玺深深体会到自己的责任是更加重大也更加艰巨了，所以钻研技术、学习苏联先进经验的劲头也越来越大了。四月十九日，韦玉玺在车间办公室看到了报纸上介绍的科列索夫新式车刀工作法后，便赶紧找技术员丁积飞研究。“这也没有详细的技术介绍，怎么个研究法呢？”技术员有些发愁。也的确是个困难，可是如果学会了就能把生产效率提高几倍，韦玉玺怎么能舍得放下呢。他像寻觅珍珠似的一个字一个字的看着报纸上的介绍，尽力想找出所需要的东西。忽然，他拍着丁积飞的肩膀，高兴地说：“老丁，你看，‘刀尖圆角半径越大，制件加工表面也越光滑’，‘科列索夫设计的新型车刀和普通外圆车刀不同的地方，主要在于它有附加切削刃’，这两句话不已经给咱们点破了吗？咱们就照这个道理干它一下。”经过他们几天的摸索，算是制出了“新式车刀”的样子，一试验果真灵验，走刀量由零点四公厘加大到二公厘，但是还有一个毛病，就是切下来的“切屑”不碎，都成了一根根的长条，对车活妨碍很大。就在这个时候，四月二十四日的报纸登载了科列索夫新式车刀工具图样，韦玉玺赶紧拿着图样去找丁积飞。这回制出来的刀具，切削下来的“切屑”就都成小勾形的碎屑了。这个新的成就，使韦玉玺又充满信心地修改了自己的计划，把机器开动时间提高到最高达到百分之八十五，切削速度提高到一分钟六百公尺。
    韦玉玺同志的主人翁的劳动态度，和他积极钻研技术，努力学习苏联先进经验的结果，显著地提高了劳动生产效率：一月份完成工时定额百分之二百三十五点七一五，二月份完成百分之二百零六点一五，三月份完成百分之二百点九四，四月份完成百分之二百二十二点○三，五月份完成百分之三百六十二点六二。至六月十五日为止，平均完成上半年工时定额百分之二百二十六点四六五。这些成绩使他获得了很高的荣誉。在五月里，辽西省总工会批准他为辽西省工业劳动模范。
    还需要进一步培养和领导
    锦西化工厂对于韦玉玺同志的培养工作，已取得很大成绩，但是也还存在着缺点。首先是厂的领导上对韦玉玺同志提出的计划缺乏必要的指导，如质量百分之百合格，今年国庆前完成改造皮带车床一台为切削汽油桶大盖子的自动车床，年底前提高本人文化程度到高级职业学校毕业的程度等等，这些提法是不够妥当的。其次，厂的领导未通过分厂和车间的党、行政、工会、青年团等组织就直接进行工作，因而使分厂、车间曾一度对韦玉玺同志关心与支持不够。因而在一月至六月十五日的五个半月中，由于开会、访问、作报告及生病等原因，使韦玉玺实际工作时间仅达七十八天多。因此，锦西化工厂的领导上应记取以上的教训并在今后加以改进。
