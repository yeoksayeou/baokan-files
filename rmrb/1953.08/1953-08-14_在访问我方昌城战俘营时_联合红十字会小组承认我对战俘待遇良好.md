Xinhua News Agency, Changcheng, 13th. A joint Red Cross team visited the prisoner-of-war camp here on the 12th. They discovered a completely different situation from that on Koje Island: there was no barbed wire, and only about ten armed guards were watching over the POW camp. The camp covers nearly one square kilometer and holds more than 1,400 American and British prisoners of war.

American representative Howard McGee, after seeing a large amount of meat and vegetables piled on tables in the kitchen of a British company, said: "The food is good."

Three ruddy-faced British cooks were frying eggs, with a large box of eggs beside them. British representative Roy Jerram said to the three cooks, "I hope the prisoners of war eat all these eggs."

The visitors found that the prisoners of war did not sleep on the ground as they did on Koje Island, but on double-decker beds.

Behind the rows of tile-roofed dormitories where the British company lived, the joint Red Cross team members saw several sports grounds, a boxing ring, and a punching bag for practice.

A staff member of the POW camp told the Red Cross team members: "If it weren't for the rain, you wouldn't see these prisoners of war inside during the day."

On the wall of the dormitory hung a red mailbox with the words: "Mail collected at 8:30 AM daily".

Danish representative Nelson Megerd expressed his opinion after visiting the British company's club, "This is a well-organized club."

The club was decorated by the prisoners of war with large watercolor paintings. The prisoners of war play ping-pong and find-a-word games here, two games that the prisoners of war are increasingly fond of. There are also more than a dozen tables for everyone to play chess and cards. On the wall facing the entrance hangs a record table of these prisoners of war and the various track and field events of the three camp-wide sports meets held in the past fourteen months. A Danish doctor, Holger K. Jakobsen, after carefully examining these records, said: "These excellent records show the good health of these people."

British prisoner of war Walter Gray, who has been the librarian of this company for the past ten months, led the Red Cross personnel to visit the library, which contains books and magazines from eight countries including Britain and the United States. Canadian representative Albert Batton randomly took a book from the shelf and said to the British Red Cross representative: "They have the works of Dickens and Shakespeare."

The August entertainment program posted on the bulletin board outside the club attracted the attention of these representatives. The program listed prizes for weekly bridge, whist, and other card games, as well as prizes for monthly ping-pong, football, and volleyball matches. The bulletin board also posted sports news and features clipped from British and American newspapers.

Crossing a small stream and climbing a small hill, the visitors arrived at the hospital overlooking the entire POW camp. Forty prisoners of war each had a bed. The hospital was equipped with everything needed for a modern hospital, with a complete staff of doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel. They did an excellent job in protecting the health of the prisoners of war and treating the sick. On average, only one-third of the beds in the hospital are occupied at any given time. The hospital director explained: "This is because we take care of the prisoners of war regularly, engage in regular sports activities, and work hard to improve sanitary conditions."

Canadian representative Albert Batton, in stating the general opinion of the team after visiting the POW camp, said: "Not bad."

Consolation goods sent here by the Red Cross Societies of various countries that sent troops to participate in the "United Nations Command" in accordance with the Korean Armistice Agreement were distributed to the prisoners of war yesterday with the assistance of the POW camp authorities.

### 在访问我方昌城战俘营时  联合红十字会小组承认我对战俘待遇良好

    在访问我方昌城战俘营时
    联合红十字会小组承认我对战俘待遇良好
    【新华社昌城十三日电】联合红十字会小组在十二日访问了这里的战俘营，他们发现了和巨济岛完全不同的情况：这里没有铁丝网，看守战俘营的武装卫兵只有十名左右。这个战俘营占地将近一平方公里，拘留有一千四百名以上美国和英国战俘。
    美国代表霍华德·麦吉看到一个英国中队的厨房里桌子上堆着大量的肉类和蔬菜后说：“吃的不错。”
    三个面孔红红的英国厨子正在炸鸡蛋，他们身旁还有一大箱鸡蛋。英国代表罗埃·杰拉姆对这三个厨子说，“我希望战俘们把这么多鸡蛋都吃掉。”
    来访的人们发现，战俘们不像在巨济岛那样睡在地上，而是睡在双层铺上。
    在这个英国中队住的一排排瓦顶的宿舍后面，联合红十字会小组人员看到几个运动场，一个拳击场和一个给人们用来实习的沙袋。
    战俘营的一个工作人员告诉红十字会小组人员说：“如果不是因为下雨，白天这个时候你在屋子里面是看不到这些战俘的。”
    在宿舍的墙上挂着一个红色邮箱，上面写着：“每天上午八时三十分取件”。
    丹麦代表奈尔逊·梅格尔德参观了这个英国中队的俱乐部出来之后，发表意见说，“这是一个很好的组织”。
    俱乐部被战俘们用大幅的水彩画装饰着。战俘们在这里玩乒乓球和觅韵游戏，这是战俘们愈来愈喜欢的两种游戏。另外还有十几张桌子给大家下棋和玩扑克牌。在一进门迎面的墙上，挂着一张这些战俘们以及过去十四个月中举行的三次全营运动会的各项田径赛的纪录表。一个丹麦医生霍尔吉尔·克·雅各布逊在仔细地看了这些纪录后说：“这些优良的纪录表明了这些人的健康状况。”
    过去十个月来一直在担任这个中队的图书馆管理员的英国战俘华尔特·葛雷，领着红十字会人员参观这个图书馆，图书馆里面有包括英国、美国等八个国家的书报杂志。加拿大代表艾伯特·巴敦随便由书架上抽了一本书出来，他对英国红十字会代表说：“他们有狄更斯和莎士比亚的著作。”
    在俱乐部外面的布告牌上贴着的八月份文娱节目，吸引了这些代表们的注意。节目中开列了每周桥牌、惠斯特（四人玩的一种王牌戏）和其他牌戏的奖品，以及每月乒乓球、足球和排球赛的奖品。布告牌上还贴着从英美报纸上剪下来的体育新闻和特写。
    跨过一条小溪，爬上一座小山，这些来访的人就到了俯视着整个战俘营的医院。四十名战俘每人有一张病床，这医院中具备了一座现代化医院所需要的一切设备，有一批阵容完整的医生、护士和其他医务人员。他们在保护战俘的健康和医治病人方面做得很出色。医院中的病床平均只有三分之一经常占用，医院院长解释说：“这是因为我们对战俘经常照顾，按时作体育活动以及我们努力改进卫生状况的结果。”
    加拿大代表艾伯特·巴敦在表明该小组参观战俘营后的一般意见时说：“还不坏。”
    依照朝鲜停战协定由派有部队参加“联合国军司令部”的各国的红十字会送到这里的慰问品，已于昨天在战俘营当局的协助下分发给战俘。
