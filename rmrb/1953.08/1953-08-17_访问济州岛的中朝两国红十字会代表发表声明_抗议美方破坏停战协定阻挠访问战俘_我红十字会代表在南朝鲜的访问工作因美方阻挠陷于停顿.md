(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th) Representatives of the Chinese Red Cross Society and the Korean Red Cross Society of the Joint Red Cross Team, Jeju Island Group, issued the following statement to reporters regarding the unreasonable restrictions imposed by the United Nations Command prisoner-of-war camp management authorities on visits by representatives of the Chinese and Korean Red Cross Societies to prisoner-of-war camps:

As representatives of the Chinese and Korean Red Cross Societies of the Joint Red Cross Team, Jeju Island Group, visiting prisoner-of-war camps under the administration of the United Nations Command, we arrived at Jeju Island, the detention site for captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, at 09:20 on August 6th, carrying the deep concern of the Chinese and Korean people for our captured personnel. However, the United Nations Command prisoner-of-war camp management authorities adopted an uncooperative attitude towards the visits of the Chinese and Korean representatives of the Joint Red Cross Team, imposing various unreasonable restrictions, so that the visit work could not be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement and the work agreement of the Joint Red Cross Team. As a result, we were ultimately unable to meet with our captured personnel and were forced to leave Jeju Island.

When the Jeju Island Group of the Joint Red Cross Team arrived on Jeju Island, the prisoner-of-war camp management authorities allowed two hours of visit time (14:00 to 16:00 on August 6th) that afternoon to the 600 captured personnel of our side who were to be repatriated to Incheon Port on the morning of August 7th. However, just as the visit was about to begin, the prisoner-of-war camp management authorities temporarily proposed to review the message of condolence that we were to read to our captured personnel. Because we were eager to meet with our captured personnel and to gain time to serve them, we immediately submitted the speech draft to the prisoner-of-war camp management authorities for review, and reminded the prisoner-of-war camp management authorities that if the review time of the message of condolence was delayed until after 14:00, the visit time should also be extended accordingly. The prisoner-of-war camp management authorities agreed to this request at that time. However, due to the prisoner-of-war camp management authorities' deliberate delay, the message of condolence was not returned to us until the time was almost 16:00. We requested that the prisoner-of-war camp management authorities fulfill their promise and still guarantee us two hours of visit time. The prisoner-of-war camp management authorities not only did not fulfill their promise, but instead continued to impose unreasonable restrictions, including: the Jeju Island Group of the Joint Red Cross Team was only allowed one hour of working time on the afternoon of August 6th. What is even more serious is that the opposing military authorities arbitrarily prohibited the Korean Red Cross representative from delivering a message of condolence to the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Regarding the issue of the Chinese Red Cross representative delivering a message of condolence, the prisoner-of-war camp management authorities stated that it would be necessary to see how the prisoners of war reacted before deciding whether to allow it to be read. It can be seen from this that the purpose of these unreasonable restrictions imposed by the prisoner-of-war camp management authorities is to fundamentally obstruct our visit to the prisoners of war, and in fact to completely cancel the work tasks given to the Joint Red Cross Team by the Armistice Agreement and the work agreement of the Joint Red Cross Team. Therefore, the representatives of the Chinese Red Cross Society and the Korean Red Cross Society had no choice but to announce the termination of their work.

Since entering the United Nations Command military control area, the Chinese and Korean Red Cross representatives of the Joint Red Cross Team, Jeju Island Group, visiting prisoner-of-war camps under the administration of the United Nations Command, have also encountered many unnecessary difficulties in communication, transportation, and translation. Obviously, these obstacles also fully demonstrate that the United Nations Command side fundamentally does not want to fulfill the provisions of Paragraph 57(f)(5) and (h) of Article 3 of the Armistice Agreement and the regulations of the Joint Red Cross Team work agreement.

The American representative has emphasized more than once at the negotiating table the importance of the Red Cross visiting prisoner-of-war camps to provide humanitarian services, but when the Red Cross representatives actually began to visit the prisoner-of-war camps, the United Nations Command prisoner-of-war camp authorities adopted a policy of fundamentally obstructing the Red Cross representatives' visits. This further confirms that the US side's so-called humanitarian treatment of prisoners of war is fundamentally unspeakable. We protest against the US side's behavior of obstructing the Red Cross representatives' visits in violation of the Armistice Agreement, and resolutely demand that the opposing military authorities immediately take measures to change this situation so that the various clauses in the Armistice Agreement regarding the Joint Red Cross Team's visits to prisoner-of-war camps can be realized.

(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th) The joint Red Cross team of Korea and China has been subjected to all kinds of obstruction by the US military authorities when visiting prisoner-of-war camps in South Korea. In addition to the Jeju Island group being forced to leave South Korea and return to Panmunjom, the visit work of other groups has also been forced to a standstill. This proves that after the Korean and Chinese sides lodged a protest, the US authorities have not taken measures to improve the working conditions of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives.

In Busan, the US prisoner-of-war camp authorities restricted the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives from talking to our captured personnel and forced the representatives of the captured personnel to leave the talk venue. Finally, the US side, on the pretext of "avoiding accidents," forced the symposium between the Red Cross representatives and the captured personnel to be suspended.

The Red Cross representatives who visited the prisoner-of-war transit station at the Munsan Imjin River Bridge could only talk to the captured personnel through the barbed wire fence; the US authorities also demanded that the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives dissuade the prisoners of war from singing and saluting the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives, claiming that these were "political acts." After this unreasonable request was rejected, the US side arbitrarily canceled the visit plan agreed upon with the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives.

The Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives of the Yeongdeungpo group were concerned about the travel conditions of the captured personnel during repatriation and requested to inspect the equipment in the trains and ships carrying the captured personnel, but were rejected by the US authorities. The US side also restricted the activities of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives in distributing letters of condolence, initially limiting the time for distributing letters of condolence to one hour, and later prohibiting the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives from continuing to distribute letters of condolence. The US military authorities also limited the conversation time between the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives and the captured personnel to only three minutes; the US side also made all kinds of criticisms about the content of the messages of condolence from the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives, so that the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives could not deliver messages of condolence to the captured personnel for three days from August 6th to 8th.

On August 8, the representatives of the Geoje Island group prepared to go to the 13th sector of the first prisoner-of-war camp to observe the progress of the repatriation work, but were prevented by the US military authorities. The US side only allowed them to watch from a distance of about 100 meters through the barbed wire fence. On the morning of August 9, the US side attacked the prisoners of war with tear gas, which invaded the residence of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives, causing them to tear, cough, and have difficulty breathing for an hour.

When the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives of each group were working in South Korea, the US military authorities not only did not provide interpreters in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, but also held up the representatives' incoming and outgoing telegrams and did not provide the representatives with convenient transportation.

In contrast, the US representatives of the Joint Red Cross visiting North Korea received all kinds of conveniences from the Korean and Chinese prisoner-of-war camp management authorities. They could talk to the prisoners of war anywhere in the camp and also visited various facilities of the prisoner-of-war camp, such as dormitories, dining halls, kitchens, bathrooms, clinics, sports fields, and the prisoners of war's cultural and recreational activities. Danish representative Winton, Australian representative Morrison, and Philippine representative Louis, who worked in the Kaesong group, also unanimously expressed their gratitude to the Korean and Chinese military authorities for the convenience they were given; they also expressed their satisfaction with the visit work, believing that the prisoners of war's lives and the various facilities of the accommodation center were very good.

    访问济州岛的中朝两国红十字会代表发表声明
    抗议美方破坏停战协定阻挠访问战俘
    我红十字会代表在南朝鲜的访问工作因美方阻挠陷于停顿
    【新华社开城十六日电】联合红十字会小组济州岛分组中国红十字会代表与朝鲜红十字会代表顷就联合国军战俘营管理当局无理限制中、朝红十字会代表访问战俘营的问题，对记者发表声明如下：
    我们访问联合国军管理下的战俘营的联合红十字会小组济州岛分组的中国红十字会代表和朝鲜红十字会代表，带着中国人民和朝鲜人民对于我方被俘人员深切关怀的心情，在八月六日九时二十分到达中国人民志愿军被俘人员拘留地济州岛。但是，联合国军战俘营管理当局对于联合红十字会小组中、朝代表的访问采取了不合作的态度，提出了种种无理的限制，以致访问工作不能按照停战协定的规定和联合红十字会小组工作协议进行，结果终于未能与我方被俘人员会晤，被迫离开了济州岛。
    当联合红十字会小组济州岛分组到达济州岛后，战俘营管理当局允许可在当天下午以两小时的时间
    （八月六日十四时至十六时），访问八月七日早晨即将遣返至仁川港的六百名我方被俘人员。但正当访问将要开始时，战俘营管理当局临时提出要审查我们向我方被俘人员宣读的慰问词。由于我们迫切地希望和我方被俘人员会晤，并为了争取时间为他们服务，我们立即将讲话稿交予战俘营管理当局审查，并提醒战俘营管理当局注意：如果审查慰问词的时间推延至十四时以后，访问的时间也应该因此顺延。当时战俘营管理当局也答应了这一要求。但由于战俘营管理当局有意拖延时间，以致将慰问词交还我们时，时间已快到十六时了。我们要求战俘营管理当局实践诺言，仍应保证我们有两小时的访问时间。战俘营管理当局非但没有实践自己的诺言，相反地继续提出了不合理的限制，这些限制包括：联合红十字会小组济州岛分组在八月六日下午只准有一小时的工作时间。尤有甚者，对方军事当局横蛮地禁止朝鲜红十字会代表向中国人民志愿军被俘人员致慰问词。对于中国红十字会代表致慰问词的问题，战俘营管理当局表示，须视战俘的反应如何，才能决定是否允许宣读。由此可以看出，战俘营管理当局这些无理的限制，其目的是要根本阻挠我们访问战俘，实际上一笔勾销停战协定和联合红十字会小组工作协议给予联合红十字会小组的工作任务。因此，中国红十字会代表和朝鲜红十字会代表不得不被迫宣布终结自己的工作。
    访问联合国军管理下战俘营的联合红十字会小组济州岛分组中、朝红十字会代表，自从进入联合国军军事控制地区后，在通讯、交通、翻译诸问题上，也曾碰到很多不应有的困难。很显然，这些障碍也充分表明了联合国军方面是根本不想履行停战协定第三条第五十七款丑项之五和寅项以及联合红十字会小组工作协议的规定的。
    美国代表在过去的谈判桌上，曾不止一次强调红十字会访问战俘营提供人道主义服务的重要性，但到红十字会代表真正开始访问战俘营的时候，联合国军战俘营当局却采取了根本阻挠红十字会代表访问的政策，这就更加证实了美方对于战俘的所谓人道主义待遇是根本见不得人的。我们抗议美方这种破坏停战协定阻挠红十字会代表访问的行为，并坚决要求对方军事当局立即采取措施，改变这种情况，使停战协定中有关联合红十字会小组访问战俘营的各项条款得以实现。
    【新华社开城十六日电】联合红十字会小组朝中代表在南朝鲜访问战俘营时遭到美军当局百般阻挠，除济州岛分组已被迫离开南朝鲜回到板门店以外，其他各分组的访问工作也已被迫陷于停顿状态。这证明在朝中方面提出抗议以后，美方当局迄未采取改善朝中红十字会代表工作条件的措施。
    在釜山，美方战俘营当局限制朝中红十字会代表和我方被俘人员谈话，并强令被俘人员代表离开谈话地点。最后，美方竟藉口“避免发生意外事件”，迫使红十字会代表与被俘人员的座谈会停开。
    在汶山临津江桥战俘转运站访问的红十字会代表，只能隔着铁丝网和被俘人员谈话；美方当局又藉口战俘唱歌和向朝中红十字会代表敬礼是“政治性行动”，要求朝中红十字会代表加以劝阻。这一无理要求被拒绝后，美方竟擅自取消了与朝中红十字会代表商定的访问计划。
    永登浦分组朝中红十字会代表关心被俘人员遣返途中的旅行条件，要求视察载运被俘人员的火车和船只内的设备，都遭到美方当局的拒绝。美方还限制朝中红十字会代表散发慰问信的活动，开始是限定分发慰问信的时间为一小时，后来竟禁止朝中红十字会代表继续散发慰问信。美军当局并限定朝中红十字会代表与被俘人员的谈话时间仅为三分钟；对朝中红十字会代表的慰问词的内容，美方也加以百般挑剔，以致八月六日至八日三天内，朝中红十字会代表不能向被俘人员致词慰问。
    八月八日，巨济岛分组代表准备到第一号战俘营第十三号营区观察遣俘工作的进行情况，遭到美军当局的阻止。美方只准他们隔着铁丝网，在距离一百公尺左右的地方观看。八月九日早晨，美方以催泪性毒气攻击战俘，毒气侵袭到朝中红十字会代表的住所，使他们流泪、咳嗽及呼吸困难达一小时之久。
    各分组朝中红十字会代表在南朝鲜进行工作时，美军当局不但没有按照停战协定的规定供给译员，而且还积压代表的来往电报，不予代表以交通工具的方便。
    与此相反，在北朝鲜访问的联合红十字会美方代表却得到朝中战俘营管理当局给予他们的种种方便。他们可以在营地任何地点和战俘谈话，还参观了战俘营的各项设备如宿舍、饭厅、厨房、浴室、诊疗所、运动场和战俘的文娱活动。在开城分组工作的丹麦代表文顿和澳大利亚代表莫里逊、菲律宾代表路易也一致对朝中方面军事当局所给予他们的便利表示感谢；他们对访问工作也表示满意，认为战俘的生活和收容所的各项设备都很好。
