Zhejiang fishermen along the coast, after a bumper harvest of ribbonfish last winter and small yellow croaker and large yellow croaker this year, have been accumulating funds to build new boats and nets to expand reproduction. As of early June, in the areas of Taohua Island, Ant Island, and Shangzhuang in the Putuo region alone, more than 30 new boats had been built, including 20 large fishing boats and 8 pairs of small boats; more than 100 more are under construction. These new boats can solve the problem of going to sea for more than 1,000 people. Many fishermen have added new nets. In He Wai alone, 16 pairs of small boats have added 16 new nets.

However, waste has also occurred among fishermen in some areas. Some fishermen overeat, overdrink, and gamble heavily. In Xiazhi Island, 215 households extensively repaired graves, spending a total of more than 430 million yuan on wages, materials, feasts, and gifts. This amount of money could build 14 large fishing boats. Bi Xintai of Lianghu Township received 2 million yuan during the spring fishing season but spent 2.5 million yuan to repair graves, causing extreme difficulties in his life and forcing him to rely on borrowing to survive. This serious waste is still growing in some areas. Xiazhi Island originally planned to build 47 new large fishing boats; because much of the money was wasted, now only 15 can be built. The main reason for the waste is that, on the one hand, the leadership has not paid attention to publicizing the policy of developing fisheries production, and fishermen have misunderstandings about the future of social development; on the other hand, fishermen's lives were unstable in the past, and after a good harvest, they try their best to consume, "a merry life while life is green," fearing that they will encounter accidents in the future and will not be able to enjoy themselves again. Local leading cadres should conduct in-depth investigations and understanding, conduct a comprehensive review from the perspective of policy implementation, and seize the gap in the off-season of fishing to properly conduct future education for fishermen, improve their political awareness, eliminate waste, and invest funds in expanding reproduction.

    浙江渔民丰收后积累资金扩大再生产
    浙江沿海渔民去冬带鱼汛和今年的小黄鱼汛、大黄鱼汛丰收以后，纷纷积累资金，制造新船新网，扩大再生产。到六月上旬为止，仅普陀地区的桃花岛、蚂蚁岛和上庄等地，就已经造好新船有三十多只，其中大捕船二十只，小对船八对；还有一百多只正在修造。这些新船能解决一千多人的出海问题。许多渔民添置了新网。仅在荷外就有十六对小对船新添了十六顶新网。
    但部分地区的渔民也发生了浪费的现象，有些渔民大吃、大喝、大赌。虾峙岛就有二百一十五户大修坟墓，工资、材料、请吃、送礼，共计用去约四亿三千多万元，这笔钱能造大捕船十四只。良湖乡的毕信台，春汛分到二百万元，为修坟墓却用去了二百五十万元，造成生活上极大的困难，不得不靠借贷来维持。这种严重的浪费情况在有些地区还在滋长着。虾峙全岛原计划新造大捕船四十七只；由于许多钱浪费了，现在只能造十五只。浪费的主要原因，一方面是领导方面未注意宣传发展渔业生产的政策，渔民对社会发展前途有误解；一方面是渔民过去的生活不安定，得到丰收后就尽量消费，“今朝有酒今朝醉”，怕以后遭到意外，不能再享受。当地领导干部应当深入调查了解，从执行政策方面作一次全面的检查，并紧紧抓住渔汛淡季的空隙，对渔民正确地进行前途教育，提高他们的政治觉悟，杜绝浪费，把资金投入扩大再生产。  （翟作标）
