Reader's Letter Summary:

    Reader Jiao Yuanrui writes: All the militiamen in the Fifth District of Huailai County, Hebei Province, are actively participating in substitute farming work. Since the summer weeding began, all the militiamen in the district have resolved the difficulties in weeding for 255 families of martyrs and military personnel in the district, weeding more than 1,150 mu of seedlings for sorghum, corn, yam, sunflower, and millet, and completing the plans for first and second weedings on schedule. For example, Zhao Jinhua, a military family member from Shangbaying Village, had no labor at home and no money to hire workers. After militiaman team clerk Liu Wenming and militiaman Hu Guangfa discovered this, they immediately mobilized 25 militiamen comrades, and in one noon they weeded all three mu of Zhao Jinhua's millet field and three mu of sorghum and bean field. Another example is that Feng Jinhua and 14 other families of martyrs and military personnel in Waijinggou Village all lacked labor at home and could not solve the difficulties in weeding. After village cadre Zhang Yongheng discovered this, he immediately convened a meeting of militiamen, calling on everyone to solve the difficulties for families of martyrs and military personnel. As a result, more than 40 militiamen volunteered to participate, weeding 45 mu of land for families of martyrs and military personnel, including sorghum, corn, millet, and beans. The families of martyrs and military personnel were very happy. Military family members Feng Jinhua and Wang Yongen unanimously stated that they would write to tell their relatives on the front line that any difficulties at home could be solved and that they should work with peace of mind.

    怀来县第五区民兵积极为烈属和军属锄苗
    读者焦元瑞来信：河北省怀来县第五区全体民兵积极参加代耕工作。夏锄以来，该区全体民兵为该区二百五十五户烈军属解决了锄苗中的困难，共锄高粱、玉米、山药、葵花、谷子等苗地一千一百五十多亩，按时完成了锄头苗、二苗的计划。如上八营村军属赵金花，家中无劳动力，也无钱雇工，民兵队文书刘文明和民兵胡光法发觉后，立即动员民兵同志二十五名，在一个中午时间把赵金花的谷子地三亩、高粱和豆子地三亩全部锄完。又如外井沟村封金花等十四户烈军属家中都缺少劳动力，无法解决锄苗中的困难。该村民干部张永恒发现后，立即召开了民兵队员大会，号召大家为烈军属解决困难。结果有四十多个民兵自动报名参加，给烈军属锄了高粱、玉米、谷子、豆子等地四十五亩。烈军属们非常高兴。军属封金花、王永恩等一致表示，要写信告诉在前方的亲人，家中的什么困难都能解决，要他们安心工作。
