Nanjing's Yanzi矶 Town People's Representatives Widely Collect Proposals and Opinions from the Masses

    The thirty-three people's representatives elected from various constituencies in Yanzi矶 Town, Nanjing, have established close ties with the masses. Before attending the town's People's Congress, the representatives collected a large number of proposals and opinions from the masses.
    These thirty-three people's representatives are all outstanding figures with high political awareness and ability to handle affairs, and who have close ties with the broad masses. Wei Weili, sixty-one years old, has been a dyer and cart driver for more than forty years. He was also elected as a model worker in the patriotic health campaign and was unanimously elected as a town people's representative by the masses this time. He personally witnessed the sham constitutionalism of the Qing Dynasty and the ugly farce of the Kuomintang using gold bars, beauties, and wine and meat to lure people and sending police to force people to participate in the "general election." When he received his certificate of election, he said with emotion: "I never thought I would have such glory today! Melons and vines grow on their stems, fish rely on water, and from now on I will certainly not disappoint Chairman Mao and the voters." After the election, he collected eight proposals from voters through mass meetings and individual visits. Geng Xuezhen, a midwife and housewife, often talked to people after being elected as a representative. She said: "People's representatives cannot be separated from the people, and those who do not serve the people are not good people's representatives." Because she is illiterate, she specifically asked someone to sort out the opinions of the masses she collected, preparing to submit them to the People's Congress and the People's Government. Currently, the thirty-three people's representatives in Yanzi矶 Town have all been assigned specific tasks. They establish contact with the masses through small chats, individual conversations, and other means. Before the first session of the first town People's Congress, they had already collected more than 190 proposals and opinions from the masses regarding production, water conservancy construction, cultural education, health construction, and criticism of cadre work style, preparing to bring them to the People's Congress for discussion.
    The representatives help the masses solve the problems they raise whenever possible. Xia Wenguang, a worker at a youth store, can hear requests and opinions from the masses every day. One day, he collected eight opinions from the masses and promptly answered and helped solve them. Internal conflicts in the town's mule cart team affected the transportation of basic construction materials. People's Representatives Wei Weili, et al., convened a meeting of mule cart industry representatives with the town People's Government, and formulated effective systems to restore normal transportation. Vendors selling bran in the town faced many difficulties due to decentralized management. People's Representatives Liu Darong, Zhang Jinlan, et al., suggested that the town People's Government convene a meeting of vendors to organize them and implement joint purchase and sales, which saved manpower and improved order. Some masses raised issues that the state's economic strength could not handle at the time. The representatives patiently explained the state's industrialization policies and guidelines to the masses, educating them to combine individual and partial interests with the overall interests of the country.

Shenyang Tiexi District Election Committee Holds Experience Exchange Meeting on Combining Universal Suffrage with Production

    The Tiexi District Election Committee in Shenyang held an experience exchange meeting on combining universal suffrage with production on the 18th of this month. More than one hundred factory directors, Party committee secretaries, and responsible cadres for universal suffrage from the district's factories attended the meeting.
    The No. 7 Machinery Factory, Dyeing Factory, and No. 1 Glass Factory successively introduced their experiences in doing a good job in universal suffrage at the meeting. The common characteristics of these experiences are: 1. The importance and support of Party and administrative cadres in each factory, the close cooperation of trade unions and the Communist Youth League, unified planning, and unified action are key to doing a good job in universal suffrage. The universal suffrage work plan of the No. 7 Machinery Factory was discussed four times at the Party committee meeting before it was started after the cadres' thinking was unified. The factory director personally gave a report, and the administration provided manpower and material support, purchasing sixty copies of universal suffrage propaganda books. In addition, specific divisions of labor were made, such as the Party branches in each workshop being responsible for collecting propaganda effects and the ideological situation of employees; the trade union being responsible for various literary and artistic propaganda; and the Communist Youth League being responsible for calling on young people to become the backbone and active members of universal suffrage propaganda. 2. Transferring cadres for centralized training and use, and explaining work methods to them. For example, after the No. 12 Machinery Factory trained more than 400 cadres, they became familiar with the policies, had a bottom line in their hearts, and learned work methods, which guaranteed the smooth development of universal suffrage work. After transferring cadres, the No. 1 Glass Factory uniformly allocated and used cadres' strengths. 3. Through different forms, universal suffrage is closely integrated with production, and propaganda activities are carried out to raise employees' awareness. Propaganda generally uses blackboard newspapers, loudspeakers, and color cartoons. After the workers received universal suffrage propaganda and education, they held discussions, compared the lives of the old and new societies, and raised their awareness. Therefore, they proposed the slogan of doing a good job in production to welcome universal suffrage. The No. 1 Glass Factory launched a red flag competition to welcome universal suffrage; more than 20 production teams in the Dyeing Factory proposed action plans to welcome universal suffrage; twelve production teams in the third workshop of the No. 7 Machinery Factory completed their production plans five days ahead of schedule; and the quality of 52-horsepower supports increased from 80% to 100%. The factory's total output value in July completed 101%; and the total value of goods completed 105%.

Bayan County Leaders' Thinking on Universal Suffrage Cadres is Unclear, Resulting in the Phenomenon of Separating from Production and Only Engaging in Universal Suffrage

    Bayan County, Songjiang Province, has already begun universal suffrage work in some districts and villages during the period of hanging up hoes (a period when agricultural work is less intensive). Many cadres have an unclear understanding of the policy of "taking production as the center and combining it with doing a good job in universal suffrage," and the phenomenon of separating from production and only engaging in universal suffrage has occurred in their work.
    Although the cadres leading universal suffrage in Bayan County have undergone a period of study beforehand, their understanding of the policy of taking production as the center and combining it with doing a good job in universal suffrage is still very vague. Ye Fu, the third captain of the universal suffrage work team, said to the leaders of the Ninth District when transmitting the work policy: "This time there are two major tasks (meaning production and universal suffrage are two major centers)." When transmitting to the leaders of the Eighth District, the fourth captain Wang Ping said: "We (referring to the universal suffrage work team) take universal suffrage as the center and combine it with production; you (referring to the cadres who stayed in the district and did not participate in universal suffrage study) take production as the center and combine it with universal suffrage." When the leading cadres of the first brigade met with the district leaders to study work, someone even proposed at the meeting: "Universal suffrage cadres cannot completely undertake (leadership) production tasks." As a result, the meeting lasted a day, and only twenty minutes were used to talk about production. Currently, among the general cadres participating in universal suffrage, the more common thinking is: "Combine with production if you can, and it's okay if you can't combine it and it doesn't affect it," "How can production be combined? It's really hard to combine!"
    Because the cadres' thinking is not clear, problems have occurred in their work. For example, the leaders of some districts, fearing that unified organizational forces would squeeze out production, formed work groups separately with cadres who had not received universal suffrage training, only engaging in production and not asking about universal suffrage. Another example is the universal suffrage work team that went to Pingyang Village in the Eighth District, which convened a large meeting of Party members, Youth League members, village cadres, and mutual aid team leaders, spending the whole day studying how to engage in universal suffrage, but not mentioning production at all. The universal suffrage work team working in Ronghou Village in the Tenth District also only paid attention to universal suffrage work and separated from production. Currently, this practice of mainly focusing on universal suffrage work and treating production work as a supplement has aroused dissatisfaction among rural Party members, Communist Youth League members, village cadres, and farmers.

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    南京市燕子矶镇人民代表广泛向群众搜集提案和意见
    南京市燕子矶镇各选区所选出的三十三名人民代表，和群众建立了密切的联系。代表们在出席镇人民代表大会以前，向群众搜集了大量的提案和意见。
    这三十三名人民代表都是具有较高的政治觉悟和办事能力，并是和广大群众有紧密联系的优秀人物。六十一岁的魏为立当了四十多年的染匠、车夫，在爱国卫生运动中又当选为模范，这次被群众一致选举为镇人民代表。他亲眼看过满清皇朝的伪立宪，也看过国民党用金条、美女、酒肉来引诱并派警察逼迫人民参加“大选”的丑剧。当他拿到当选证书时，感动地说：“我真想不到能有今天的光荣！瓜生藤蔓鱼靠水，今后我一定不辜负毛主席和选民们的心意。”选举以后，他通过群众会议及个别访问的方式，向选民收集了八件提案。接生员、家庭妇女耿学珍当选代表以后，经常找人谈话。她说：“人民代表离不了人民，不给人民办事的就不算好人民代表。”因为自己不识字，她特别请人把收集到的群众的意见整理出来，准备向人民代表大会和人民政府提出。现在，燕子矶镇的三十三个人民代表都按具体情况分了工，他们通过小型漫谈、个别交谈等方式和群众建立联系。在召开第一届第一次镇人民代表大会以前，他们已经从群众中收集到有关生产、兴修水利、文化教育、卫生建设及批评干部作风的提案和意见一百九十多件，准备带到代表大会上去讨论。
    代表们对群众所提出的问题，有的能够解决的都随时帮助群众解决。青年店员工人夏文广，每天都能从群众中听取要求和意见，有一天他收集到八件群众反映的意见，都及时答复和帮助解决了。镇上骡车组内部闹意见，影响基本建设材料的运输，人民代表魏为立等便会同镇人民政府召开骡车业代表会议，订出了有效的制度，使运输恢复正常。镇上卖糠秕的摊贩因经营上的分散，发生很多困难，人民代表刘大荣、张金兰等便建议镇人民政府召开了摊贩会议，把摊贩们组织起来，实行联合购销，这样既节省了人力，秩序也改进了。有部分群众提出了目前国家经济力量一时办不到的事，代表们都向群众耐心解释国家工业化的政策和方针，教育群众要把个人的利益、部分的利益和国家的整体利益结合起来。（新华社）
    沈阳市铁西区选举委员会召开普选结合生产经验交流会议
    沈阳市铁西区选举委员会于本月十八日召开普选结合生产经验交流会议，到会的有全区工厂的厂长、党委书记以及普选负责干部等百余人。
    机械七厂、染料厂、玻璃一厂先后在会上介绍了搞好普选的经验。这些经验的共同特点是：一、各厂党、行政干部的重视和支持，工会、青年团的密切配合，统一计划、统一行动，是作好普选的关键。机械七厂的普选工作计划，在党委会上讨论了四次，干部思想统一后才开始的。厂长亲自作报告，行政上又给以人力和物力的支持，购买了六十册普选宣传书籍。此外，还作了具体分工，如各个车间的党支部负责搜集宣传效果和职工思想情况；工会负责各种文艺宣传；青年团负责号召青年成为普选宣传中的骨干和积极分子。二、抽调干部集中训练和使用，并交代给他们工作办法。如机械十二厂训练了四百多名干部后，他们熟悉了政策，心里有了底，也学会了工作方法，这就保证了普选工作的顺利开展。玻璃一厂抽调干部后，将干部力量强弱进行了统一分配和使用。三、通过不同形式，使普选紧密地结合生产，开展宣传活动，以提高职工觉悟。宣传一般都是利用黑板报、广播筒、彩色漫画等。工人们受到普选宣传教育以后，举行了座谈，对比了新旧社会的生活，提高了觉悟，因而，他们提出搞好生产，迎接普选的口号。玻璃一厂展开了迎接普选红旗竞赛；染料厂有二十多个生产小组，提出迎接普选的行动计划；机械七厂三车间有十二个生产小组提前五天完成了生产计划；五十二马力支架的质量由百分之八十提高到百分之百。该厂七月份生产总值完成百分之一百零一；商品总值完成百分之一百零五。
    巴彦县领导普选干部思想不明确发生脱离生产只搞普选的现象
    松江省巴彦县已经有部分区村结合挂锄期间开始普选工作。很多干部对“以生产为中心，结合搞好普选”的方针认识不明确，在工作中发生脱离生产只搞普选的现象。
    巴彦县领导普选的干部，事先虽然经过一个阶段的学习，但对以生产为中心结合搞好普选的方针认识得仍很模糊，普选工作队第三大队长叶福在向九区领导上传达工作方针时竟说：“这次是两大任务
    （意指生产、普选两大中心）。”第四大队长汪屏向八区领导上传达时说：“我们（指普选工作队）以普选为中心，结合生产；你们（指留区未参加普选学习的干部）以生产为中心，结合普选。”第一大队领导干部在与区领导上开会研究工作时，会上竟有人提出：“普选干部不能完全承担（领导）生产任务。”结果开会一天，只用二十分钟的时间来谈生产。目前在参加普选的一般干部的思想中较普遍的存在着：“能结合生产便结合，不能结合不影响就行”，“生产怎么结合呢？真不好结合！”
    由于干部在思想上不明确，在工作中就发生了问题。如有的区的领导上怕统一组织力量把生产挤掉，而把没有受普选训练的干部单独组成工作组，只搞生产不问普选。又如到八区平阳村的普选工作组，召集党员、团员、村干部、互助组长开大会，整天时间都用来研究怎样搞普选，但对生产却只字未提。在十区荣厚村工作的普选工作组，也是只注意普选工作，而脱离了生产。目前，这种以普选工作为主，把生产工作做为陪衬的做法，已引起农村党员、青年团员、村干部及农民的不满。
