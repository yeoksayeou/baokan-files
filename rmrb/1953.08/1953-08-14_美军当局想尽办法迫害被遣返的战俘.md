Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 12th: In order to force repatriated prisoners of war to betray their conscience and fabricate lies about "mistreatment" of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese side, so as to realize its ulterior political conspiracy, the US military authorities are trying every possible means to persecute the repatriated prisoners of war.

The U.S. military authorities, using the pretext that the repatriated prisoners of war are "suspected of espionage," have specially dispatched a large number of secret agents to examine and persecute them. It is reported that a group of United Nations prisoners of war who were sent to the Omiya camp north of Tokyo are being thoroughly investigated by U.S. intelligence personnel. This means that among these prisoners of war, there are not only American prisoners of war, but also prisoners of war from Britain and other satellite countries. The news said that U.S. intelligence personnel classified the prisoners of war in this camp and thoroughly questioned them about their experiences in the Korean and Chinese prisoner-of-war camps to determine their "reliability and whether there were any problems in their thinking." The news also said that these repatriated prisoners of war were sent to this camp under the guise of recuperation. No one is allowed to enter or leave this camp at will.

The U.S. military authorities have also labeled some American prisoners of war who resolutely refuse to betray their conscience and fabricate "mistreatment" of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese side as so-called "pro-communists" and "informers," and are preparing to further persecute them. According to the Associated Press, a spokesman for the U.S. Eighth Army and a spokesman for the Korean Transportation Zone Command publicly stated on the 11th that all American prisoners of war accused of "informing" would be thoroughly "investigated." This "investigation" will be conducted by the intelligence department of the U.S. Department of the Army. The American propaganda machine is also gleefully fabricating the "rebellion" of these prisoners of war as a pretext for the U.S. military authorities to further harm these prisoners of war.

The U.S. military authorities are also spreading the rumor that the repatriated prisoners of war are "mentally unstable." Under this pretext, they are prepared to detain and persecute the repatriated American prisoners of war for a long time. According to the International News Service, Siegel, a so-called psychiatrist of the U.S. military in Incheon, said on the 10th that all repatriated prisoners of war are actually "living in a world of dreams," and for them, it is best to have "military control and not be allowed to return home for a long time," and to "return to their homes as slowly as possible" so that their "spirits can return to normal" and "recognize reality." Obviously, the U.S. side is extremely afraid that the repatriated prisoners of war will recognize the truth about the American aggression against Korea due to their personal experience. They are afraid that after these prisoners of war return home, they will tell the American people the truth and the fact that the Korean and Chinese side treated them kindly, so that the lies fabricated by the U.S. side will be completely bankrupt. The so-called "recognizing reality" means that after long-term persecution and imprisonment, they will be forced to change this new view and be manipulated by American politicians as in the past.

The U.S. side obviously knows that this persecution will inevitably be opposed by the American people, so they must conduct it secretly outside the United States. The American people should now be able to see clearly that it is not others who are persecuting their sons and husbands, but the American government that is desperately slandering the Korean and Chinese side for "mistreating" prisoners of war. If they do not rise up to fight, they may lose the opportunity to reunite with their sons and husbands.

### 美军当局想尽办法迫害被遣返的战俘

    美军当局想尽办法迫害被遣返的战俘
    【新华社开城十二日电】美军当局为了逼迫被遣返的战俘违背良心捏造朝中方面“虐待”战俘的谎言，以实现其不可告人的政治阴谋，正在想尽一切办法来迫害被遣返的战俘。
    美军当局藉口被遣返的战俘有“间谍嫌疑”，特地派遣了大批特务来审查和迫害他们。有消息说，一批被送到东京以北大宫营场内的联合国军战俘，正在由美方特务人员加以彻底调查。这就是说，在这些战俘中，不仅有美国战俘，而且有英国及其他仆从国家的战俘在内。消息说，美方特务人员把这个营场内的战俘加以分类，并且彻底地考问他们在朝中方面战俘营内的经历，以决定他们的“可靠性和思想上有无问题”。消息还说，这些被遣返的战俘是在休养的名义下被送到这个营场去的。在这个营场内不准随意出入。
    美军当局还把一部分坚决不愿违背良心捏造朝中方面“虐待”战俘的美国战俘，称为所谓“亲共分子”和“告密者”，准备进一步加以迫害。据美联社报道，美军第八军发言人及朝鲜交通区司令部发言人十一日公开声言，对被控“告密”的美国战俘，都要予以彻底“调查”。这种“调查”工作将由美国陆军部的情报部门来进行。美国宣传机器也正在津津有味地捏造这些战俘的“叛变”情形，作为美军当局进一步加害这些战俘的张本。
    美军当局还在放出空气，说是被遣返的战俘“精神不正常”。他们准备在这个藉口下，长期扣押和迫害被遣返的美国战俘。据国际新闻社报道，在仁川的美军所谓精神病专家西格尔十日说，所有被遣返的战俘实际上都是“生活在梦想的世界里”，对他们说来，最好是“军事管制和长时间内不能回国”，并“尽可能慢一点回到他们的家里去”，使他们的“精神恢复正常”，“认清现实”。显然，美方极端害怕被遣返的战俘由于他们亲身的经历而认清了美国侵略朝鲜的真相。他们害怕这些战俘回家以后，将把这个真相和朝中方面宽待他们的事实告诉美国人民，使美方竭力制造出来的谎言全告破产。所谓“认清现实”，就是经过长期迫害和监禁，迫使他们改变这种新的看法，像过去一样任凭美国的政客们摆布。
    美方显然知道，他们这种迫害手段必然要遭到美国人民的反对，所以他们要在美国国外偷偷地进行。美国人民现在应该可以看清楚了，迫害他们的儿子和丈夫的不是别人，正是那个拼命诬蔑朝中方面“虐待”战俘的美国政府。如果他们不起来斗争，他们就可能丧失和他们的儿子和丈夫团聚的机会。
