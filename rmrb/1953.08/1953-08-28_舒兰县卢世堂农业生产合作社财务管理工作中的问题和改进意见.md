Problems and Improvement Suggestions for Financial Management in the Lushi Tang Agricultural Production Cooperative, Shulan County
Liu Jixun

The Lushi Tang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shulan County, Jilin Province, was established on a trial basis last year. The cooperative has fifteen households, cultivating thirty-seven hectares of dry land. In the year since its establishment, it has made certain achievements in production. However, there are some problems in financial management that urgently need to be improved:

	I. Unclear Accounts. Last year, the cooperative did not establish an accounting system or formal accounts. It was managed jointly by the deputy director, Bi Yongfu, and others. Initially, there was a daybook (called "tofu accounts" by the masses), but later even the daybook was not kept. When it came time to settle accounts and distribute dividends after the autumn harvest, the accounts could not be cleared, resulting in a shortfall of more than one million yuan, which Bi had to cover himself. This year, the cooperative has an accountant and has established accounts, but the results of last year's account settlement have not been transferred to this year's accounts. Only this year's accounts have been recorded, resulting in income being recorded in the old accounts and expenses being recorded in the new accounts. The new accounts cannot be separated from the old accounts. When checking an account, it is necessary to look at the old accounts, check the new accounts, and combine them to get the result. Moreover, sometimes the accounts are not fully recorded, and there are often errors. For example, 450,000 yuan was owed to cooperative member Cao Fumin, and 250,000 yuan was repaid from last autumn to the end of June this year, but only 180,000 yuan was recorded in the accounts. Therefore, some cooperative members said, "Having accounts is the same as not having accounts." In addition, the accounts in the ledger are chaotic and unclear. Items that should be recorded in Item A are recorded in Item B, and items that should be in Item B are recorded in Item C. This makes it difficult to see the accurate figures for each expenditure.

	II. Lack of Financial Management System. Regarding expenditures, regardless of the nature and amount of the expenditure, most are controlled by the director and accountant. Although larger expenditures are discussed and agreed upon by the cooperative members, some procedures are unclear, and some lack original receipts. Of the seventy-two receipts for expenditures from January to the end of June this year, the smallest amount is two thousand yuan, and the largest is over one million yuan. The receipts do not have the director's seal or the handler's mark. After a long time, it is impossible to verify them. In particular, twelve of these seventy-two receipts, accounting for 22 percent of the total expenditures, were reimbursed without original receipts. Regarding loans to cooperative members, regardless of the amount and whether it affects the cooperative's production, most are given as long as they are requested, and repaid as long as they are returned. If they are not returned, they are not asked for. The procedures for these loans are as follows: the director approves his own loans; when cooperative members borrow, some tell the director, or take directly from the director, and some borrow directly from the accountant. These are all loans without interest and without a fixed term. The same is true for what the cooperative owes to cooperative members. The cooperative owes seven cooperative members 3.2 million yuan, and the interest has not been determined. Repayments are made by the cooperative members taking back 30,000, 50,000, 100,000, or 80,000 yuan at a time when the cooperative has money, or by offsetting debts. Some cooperative members have experienced difficulties in their lives because the cooperative's repayments are not timely. On the other hand, the cooperative's production is inevitably affected because some cooperative members occupy public funds for a long time. In particular, cooperative members use the cooperative's money for a long time without interest, so those who have not borrowed money are very dissatisfied.

	III. Accounts Not Regularly Publicized. Although the work points are recorded accurately, they have not been publicized on time from the beginning of the year to the end of June. Therefore, cooperative members reflect: "Our accounts are: remember a little in our hearts, gather a little from everyone, write a little in the account book, and it's about right when we calculate it."

	IV. The cooperative's public property is not managed by a dedicated person, nor is it regularly checked and cleaned. For example, the seeder is left in the yard after use, and the roller is left on the road unattended. There are also no regulations on the usage period and amount of items such as oil for vehicles, lamp oil, and whip handles. In particular, the amount of horse feed is large and the price is high, and the amount used is determined by the horse keepers themselves.

The reasons for the above phenomena are, first of all, the patriarchal leadership style of the cooperative's leaders. The director and accountant lack organization and planning in financial management and instead adopt a "I decide" approach, so they borrow and spend public funds casually without any approval procedures. Secondly, the accountant's professional level is low. Although the cooperative's accountant received a month of professional training at the production cooperative accountant training class held in the county this spring, the training was not practical enough, and it is still very difficult to apply it in practice. In addition, although the county and district leading organs often send people to provide specific assistance to the cooperative's work, they do not pay enough attention to financial management work and have not been able to deeply check and discover problems and help solve them in a timely manner.

In response to the above situation, to improve the financial management work of this agricultural production cooperative, we must start from the following two points:

	I. A simple and easy-to-implement financial accounting system should be formulated through democratic discussion by all cooperative members based on the specific circumstances of the cooperative. Generally, it can be divided into: approval system, account publication system, and material management system. The role of the approval system is to control expenditures and make rational use of funds. According to the current actual situation, the director, the management committee (or production management committee), and the cooperative members should separately review and approve expenditures according to the nature and amount of the expenditure. All large expenditures for the purchase of public property should generally be reviewed and approved by the cooperative members' assembly. Larger production expenditures should be approved by the management committee, and smaller daily expenses and office expenses can be approved by the director. Regardless of the size of the expenditure, there must be original receipts for reimbursement. For personal loans to cooperative members, they should not affect the cooperative's capital turnover and production. At the same time, a certain system should be democratically stipulated according to the purpose, borrowing period, and amount of borrowing and jointly implemented. The general account publication system should stipulate that the cooperative's income and expenses, internal and external transactions, and work points should be regularly announced to the cooperative members on a monthly or quarterly basis to facilitate supervision and review by the cooperative members. When necessary, the management committee can designate someone to check the accounting books to prevent corruption and waste. Material management must be democratically selected and managed by a dedicated person, and regular checks and cleaning must be carried out to avoid losses. Materials entering and leaving the warehouse must go through the custodian, and responsibility must be clearly defined during use to strengthen the responsibility system. For certain consumables such as vehicle oil, the usage period and quantity should be democratically stipulated and issued on time and in quantity to prevent waste. The custodian should regularly check the accounts with the accountant to understand the cooperative's material surplus and loss. The management committee should conduct regular checks. To do this work well, the accountant should have certain responsibilities, such as recording accounts on time, organizing them on time, publishing accounts on a regular basis, urging repayment of debts, and keeping relevant accounting materials, and mastering the accounting system. The accountant has the right not to pay for expenditures that have not been approved or are outside the budget.

	II. The county and district leading organs must strengthen ideological leadership and business leadership over agricultural cooperatives. 1. The financial accounting work of agricultural production cooperatives is relatively complicated, and at present, the accountants of general cooperatives only have three to five years of elementary school education. To keep good accounts is indeed a relatively heavy task for them. Therefore, the county leading organs must plan to run accountant training classes to improve the political and professional level of accountants, and send cadres familiar with accounting business to regularly go deep into the countryside to understand and check the financial accounting situation of agricultural cooperatives, and help solve problems specifically. Summarize experiences to guide the general and continuously improve the professional level of agricultural production cooperative accountants. When county and district cadres go deep into cooperatives to help solve problems, they should especially include financial accounting work as one of the main contents and overcome the past tendency of not understanding and not caring or not paying attention to financial work at all. 2. Improving financial accounting work must be combined with the implementation of democratic management. As far as possible, a financial plan should also be formulated when formulating the production plan, which should be discussed and approved by the cooperative members' assembly and jointly supervised and implemented. The cooperative's leaders should conscientiously overcome the patriarchal leadership style, conduct ideological education for cooperative members, strengthen cooperative members' sense of ownership, and fully promote democracy, and rely on cooperative members to continuously improve financial accounting work.

    舒兰县卢世堂农业生产合作社财务管理工作中的问题和改进意见
    刘继勋
    吉林省舒兰县卢世堂农业生产合作社是去年试办的。全社十五户，耕种三十七垧旱田。建社一年多来，在生产上作出了一定的成绩。但在财务管理工作上存在一些亟待改进的问题：
    一、账目不清。该社去年没有建立会计制度和正式账目，只是由副主任毕永富等共同管理，起初有流水账（群众叫豆腐账），后来流水账也不记了，到秋后结账分红时，账目没法算清，差账一百多万元，只好由毕自己包赔了事。今年这个社有了会计，也建立了账目，但没有把去年账目结算的结果转到今年的账上来，只记了今年的账，结果形成旧账上收，新账上支，新账离不了旧账，要查一笔账时，必须看旧账、查新账、连想带凑才能得出结果，而且有时账记不全，常有差错。如欠社员曹富民四十五万元，从去秋到今年六月底偿还二十五万元了，但在账上只记载十八万元。因此，有的社员说：“有账没账一个样。”另外，分类账的账目混乱不清，应记在甲项上的记到了乙项，乙项的又记成了丙项，这样很难看出各项支出的准确数字。
    二、没有财务管理制度。在开支上，不管开支性质与数额大小，大多数都是由主任和会计掌握，数额较大的开支虽也经过社员讨论同意，但有的手续不清，有的缺乏原始单据。今年从一月到六月底开支的七十二张单据，最小数字是两千元，多的百万元以上，单据上既没有主任盖章，又没有经手人印记，日子久了没法对证了。特别是这七十二张单据中有占开支总数百分之二十二的十二张无原始单据也都报销了。对社员的借款，是不管数目大小和是否影响社的生产，多半是有借就支，有还就收，不还不要。这些借款经过的手续是：主任借自己批；社员借时有的告诉主任一声，或从主任手中直接拿去，有的就直接从会计手里借。这都是没有利息和没有定期的借款。社里欠社员的也是这样。社里欠七家社员三百二十万元，说给利息也没确定。还款都是社员趁社内有钱时一次三万、五万、十万、八万地要回，或以先借后顶账的办法要回，有的社员因社还款不及时造成了生活上的困难。另一方面，又因为一部分社员长期占用公款，不免使社的生产受到影响。特别是社员欠社里的款，长期使用无利息，因此没借款的人非常不满。
    三、账目没有定期公布。虽然工账记得准确，但从年初到六月底没有按时公布。因此社员反映：
    “我们这账是：心里记点，大伙凑点，账本上写点，算的时候就差不多点了。”
    四、社里公共财产，没有专人负责保管，也不经常检查清理。例如播种机用完放在院子里，镇压器放在大道上没人过问。对公共用的车油、灯油、鞭鞘等物品也没有规定使用期间和用量，特别是马料等用量多，价格高，用多用少都是由养马的人自行决定。
    造成以上现象的原因，首先是社的领导干部存在家长式的领导作风。主任和会计对财务管理缺乏组织性，计划性，而是采取“自己说了算”的办法，因此不经任何审批手续随便借用和开支公款。其次是会计员业务水平低，虽然今春该社会计在县召开的生产合作社会计训练班上受过一个月的业务训练，但由于训练时结合实际不够，在实际运用时仍然困难很多。此外，县区领导机关，虽然常派人来对社的工作进行具体帮助，但对财务管理工作重视不够，没能深入检查发现问题，及时帮助解决。
    针对以上情况，要改进这个农业生产合作社财务管理工作，必须从下列二点着手。
    一、应根据社内具体情况，由全体社员民主讨论制定简单易行的财务会计制度。一般可分为：审批制度，账目公布制度，物资保管制度三类。审批制度的作用是控制开支，使资金使用合理。应根据目前实际情况，按照开支性质和数目大小分别确定由社主任、理事会（或生产管理委员会）和社员大会审查批准。凡是属于购置公共财产的大宗开支，一般均应由社员大会审查批准，数目较大的生产开支，应由理事会审批，数目较小的日常开支和办公费杂支等则可由社主任批准。不论大小开支都应有原始单据才能报销。对于社员个人借款，应不影响社内的资金周转和生产，同时应根据用途、借用期间、数额多少等民主规定一定的制度，共同执行。账目公布制度一般的应规定按月按季把社内收支，社内外往来等项目及工账，定期向社员公布，以便于社员监督和审查。必要时理事会可指定专人检查会计账目，以防止贪污浪费。对物资保管一定要民主选定专人负责，并经常进行检查清理，以免损失。物资出入库，必须通过保管员，在使用期间应明确责任，以加强责任制。对车油等某些消耗物品，应由民主规定使用期限和数量，按时定量发给，防止浪费。保管员要与会计经常对照账目，了解社内物资盈亏情况。理事会应按期检查。为做好这项工作，会计员应有一定的职责，如按时记账，按时整理，按期公布账目，催还欠款和清偿债务，保管有关会计材料，掌握会计制度等。对没有批准的和预算以外的支出会计有权不予支付。
    二、县区领导机关要加强对农业社的思想领导和业务领导。1、农业生产合作社的财务会计工作是比较复杂的，而目前一般合作社的会计员，只有三、五年小学文化程度，要计好账目，对他们来说确是一件比较繁重的工作。因此县领导机关要有计划地办好会计训练班，提高会计员的政治思想与业务水平，并要派熟悉会计业务的干部经常深入农村，有重点地了解和检查农业社的财务会计情况，具体地帮助解决问题，总结经验指导一般，不断提高农业生产合作社会计人员的业务水平。县区干部深入合作社帮助解决问题时，尤应把财务会计工作列为主要内容之一，克服过去不懂就不管或根本不重视财务工作的偏向。2、改进财务会计工作，必须与贯彻民主管理结合起来，尽可能在制定生产计划时也订出财务计划，经社员大会讨论批准，共同监督执行。社领导干部应认真克服家长式的领导作风，对社员进行思想教育，加强社员的主人翁感觉，充分发扬民主，依靠社员不断地改进财务会计工作。
