Korean Female Nurse Kim Fen
	Han Youcai Fu Jun

One night last year, after being wounded, I vaguely sat in a car, which bumped along a road in Korea. The driver said that we were being transferred from the front line to a hospital near Pyongyang. We arrived at the hospital just before dawn.

The nurses carried us inside, and were about to change our dressings when a nurse suddenly ran in anxiously and said to the doctor, "Doctor, please take a look at this comrade, his condition is very bad!" Immediately following her, a stretcher was carried in, with a seriously wounded soldier lying on it. The car had been bumping too much on the road, and the tied-off blood vessel had been shaken open again, causing a lot of blood loss along the way. He had now lost consciousness.

The situation was very serious. Only a blood transfusion could save this seriously wounded soldier's life. The doctor knew from the soldier's medical records that his blood type was "B," so he immediately prepared for a transfusion. However, whose blood was "B"? There was no time to test the blood types of potential donors. The wounded soldier's breathing became weaker and weaker, and everyone in the ward watched him with anxiety and a heavy heart. Just then, a female nurse ran in. She was wearing an ordinary yellow military uniform, covered with a white coat, and had two braids. As she walked, she rolled up her sleeves and said urgently to the doctor, "I'm blood type 'B', operate quickly!" The tense atmosphere in the room finally eased. But the doctor did not immediately operate. He looked at the nurse asking to donate blood, then looked at the dying soldier. He reluctantly grabbed the nurse's arm and began the blood transfusion for the soldier. I was a bit confused, so I whispered to the nurse next to me, "Why is the doctor hesitating?" The nurse whispered back, "This blood donor is Kim Fen. Including this time, she has donated blood five times. She used to be very healthy, but due to excessive blood donation, her body is now very weak. It seems the doctor is worried about a dangerous outcome, so he is hesitating."

After hearing the nurse's explanation and seeing Kim Fen's face, which seemed even paler, I was so moved that I couldn't speak for a long time.

At that time, my injuries were also very serious, and I couldn't return to the motherland for recuperation immediately, so I had to stay in that hospital. During the days I spent with Kim Fen, I was deeply moved by her meticulous care for the wounded. Because she had donated too much blood, the doctor advised her to rest for a period, but she refused, saying, "This is much less blood than the soldiers on the front line are shedding, how could it hinder my work!" She was responsible for taking care of a seriously wounded soldier, washing his feet, feeding him, and helping him with his bowel movements every day. She also voluntarily took care of other wounded soldiers. She often washed clothes and read newspapers for the wounded. When the wounded were bored lying in bed, she would sing songs for them. She also often borrowed books from the library for the wounded to read. Sometimes when a wounded soldier was too engrossed in a book, she would gently take the book from his hand with a smile and say kindly, "Rest for a while, take a nap and then read again!" Kim Fen's actions deeply touched every wounded soldier.

One day, everyone was chatting in the room, talking about the victory on the front line and the construction of the motherland. Suddenly, enemy planes bombed near the hospital. The lightly wounded went to hide in the trenches at the foot of the mountain, and the nurses and all the hospital staff mobilized to rescue the seriously wounded. The situation became increasingly serious. It seemed that the enemy planes had discovered the hospital, and were frantically strafing the hospital. The entire hospital was obscured by the smoke from the bomb explosions. At this moment, someone shouted, "There's still a seriously wounded soldier inside!" As soon as the words fell, a nurse was seen running out of the crowd, rushing quickly towards the smoke-filled ward. Everyone said in unison, "It's Kim Fen!"

More than a month later, the seriously wounded soldier who had been rescued with a blood transfusion gradually recovered his health. At this time, someone told him, "Your life was saved by Kim Fen's blood!" After hearing others tell him about Kim Fen giving him the blood transfusion, he sat there blankly, tears of gratitude streaming down his face. He asked someone to find Kim Fen, held her hand tightly, and didn't know what to say. After a moment, he took out his beloved little notebook that the motherland's People's慰问团 had given him, and asked Kim Fen to write a few words on it as a permanent memento. Kim Fen picked up the pen and wrote on the notebook:

"To Comrade Sui Hai, a beloved and heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier who is aiding the liberation of Korea and defending world peace: Your precious blood is flowing on the land of Korea. My giving you a little blood is only considered to be comforting you, please do not take it to heart. This shows that the people of Korea and China are as close as flesh and blood. Let the friendship between our two peoples, forged with blood, last forever! I hope you rest and recuperate, recover your health soon, and fight to the end for the peace of Korea, the Far East, and the whole world!"

I have been back to the motherland for almost a year, and the image of Kim Fen often appears in my mind. Whenever I think of her, I deeply feel that "the people of China and Korea are as close as flesh and blood."

    朝鲜女护士金芬
    韩有才  孚君
    去年一天夜晚，我受伤后迷迷糊糊地坐在一辆汽车上，汽车在朝鲜的公路上颠颠簸簸地奔驰着。司机说，我们是从前线转到平壤附近的某医院去的。天快亮的时候我们到了医院。
    护士们把我们抬到屋里，刚想给我们换药，一位护士忽然从外面匆忙地跑进来，焦急地向医生说：“大夫，你快看看这位同志，情形很不好！”紧跟着从外面抬进来一副担架，上面躺着一个重伤员。路上汽车颠得过猛，扎住的血管又给震开了，一路上流了很多的血，现在已经失去了知觉。
    情况是十分严重的。只有输血才能挽回这个重伤员的生命。医生从这位伤员的病历中知道他的血是“B型”的，就马上准备进行输血。可是，谁的血是“B型”的呢？时间已经不允许化验输血人的血型了。伤员的呼吸越来越微弱了，病室里所有的人都带着一种焦急而沉重的心情看着这位伤员。就在这时候，突然从外面跑进来一个女护士，身上穿着一套普通的黄军装，外面罩着件白色的工作服，头上扎着两条小辫子。她一边走一边挽着袖子，紧忙对医生说：“我是‘B型’血，快动手术吧！”屋子里紧张的空气这才松了下来。但是医生并没有立即动手术，他看看要求输血的护士，又看看奄奄一息的伤员，他不得已似地才抓住那个护士的臂膀开始为伤员输血。我有些摸不清头脑，于是小声地问我旁边的一位护士：“大夫为什么有些犹豫呢？”那个护士也小声地告诉我：“这个输血的叫金芬，连这次她已经是第五次输血了。她的体格过去是很健康的，但是输血过多，现在身体已经非常虚弱了。看样子是大夫怕出危险，因此才犹豫的。”
    我听了护士的解释，又看看金芬的好像更加苍白了的脸色，我激动地半天说不出话来。
    当时我的伤也是很严重的，不能马上回祖国来休养，不得不在那个医院里住下来。在我和金芬在一起相处的那些日子里，她对伤员们的无微不至的爱护，深深感动着我。因为她输血过多的原故，医生劝她休息一个时期，但是她无论如何也不肯，她说：“这比前线战士们流的血少得多，哪能妨碍工作呢！”她负责照顾一个重伤员，每天给他洗脚、喂饭，扶持他大小便；并且又自动地照顾别的伤员。她经常给伤员们洗衣服、读报。当伤员们在病床上躺得寂寞的时候，她就唱歌给他们听。她又经常到图书馆里借书给伤员们看。有时伤员看书看得太恋了，她就微笑着将书从伤员手里轻轻地拿过来，温和地说：“休息休息吧，睡一觉再看！”金芬的行动深深感动着每一位伤员。
    有一天，大家正在屋里闲谈，从前线胜利谈到祖国建设。突然，敌机在医院附近轰炸了。伤势轻一点儿的都到山脚下的交通沟里隐避去了，护士们和医院所有的人全体出动抢救重伤员。情况越来越严重，好像敌机发现了这座医院，疯狂地在医院上空不停地扫射。整个医院都被炸弹爆炸的硝烟遮住了。这时不知谁喊了一声：“屋里还有个重伤员！”话音刚落，就看见一个护士从人群里跑出来，飞快地向硝烟弥漫的病房冲去。大家不约而同地说：“是金芬！”
    一个多月以后，那个被输血急救的重伤员渐渐恢复了健康。这时有人告诉他：“你的生命是金芬的鲜血救活的！”这个重伤员听到别人讲完当时金芬给他输血的情形以后，他呆呆地坐在那里，感激的热泪哗哗地流了下来。他请别人把金芬找来，紧紧地握着金芬的手，不知道说些什么话好，停了一会儿，他才拿出祖国人民慰问团赠给他的那个心爱的小本子，请金芬在上面写几句话，作为永久的纪念。金芬拿起笔来就在小本子上写着：
    “援助朝鲜解放的、保卫世界和平的、我敬爱的英勇的中国人民志愿军隋海同志：您的宝贵的鲜血流在朝鲜的国土上，我给您输了一点儿血只算是慰问你，请你不要惦记在心里。这说明我们朝中人民是血肉相联的。让我们两国人民用血结成的友谊万古常存吧！希望您安心休养，早日恢复健康，为朝鲜的远东的和全世界的和平奋斗到底！”
    我回到祖国将近一年了，金芬的形象时常出现在我的脑海里。一想到她，我就深深感到“中朝人民是血肉相连的”。
