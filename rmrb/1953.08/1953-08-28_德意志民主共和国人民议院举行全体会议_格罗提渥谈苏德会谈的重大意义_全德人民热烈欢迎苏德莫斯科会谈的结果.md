    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 27th: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held its 35th plenary session on August 25th, according to the German News Agency. Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic reported on the course of the Soviet-German Moscow talks at the meeting.

    Prime Minister Grotewohl pointed out the great historical importance of the results of the Soviet-German Moscow talks for the German people. He listed the principles agreed upon during the Moscow talks for resolving the German question, emphasizing, "The future face of Germany will be decided by the Germans themselves, without any foreign interference."

    When talking about the important new measures taken by the Soviet Union to help the German Democratic Republic improve its living standards, he cited the following expenditures in the German Democratic Republic's budget for maintaining occupation forces: In 1949, the cost of maintaining occupation forces was 2.182 billion marks, accounting for 12 percent of national income; in 1950, it was 1.993 billion marks, accounting for 10 percent of national income; in 1951, it was 1.995 billion marks, accounting for 7.7 percent of national income; in 1952, it was 1.995 billion marks, accounting for 6 percent of national income; and in 1953, it was also 1.995 billion marks, accounting for about 5.6 percent of national income. According to the decision of the Soviet government, the occupation fee will be reduced to 1.66 billion marks in 1954, accounting for about 5 percent of the total national budget income.

    Grotewohl said that, according to the Soviet-German agreement on financial and economic issues, the German Democratic Republic would benefit a total of 13.48 billion marks, without being subjected to any form of financial pressure or commercial manipulation.

    Prime Minister Grotewohl then made a comparison between the above situation and the current situation in West Germany. He pointed out the development of West Germany's occupation fee expenditures as follows: from 4 billion West German marks in 1949 to 1950, to 4.6 billion West German marks from 1950 to 1951, to 7.7 billion West German marks from 1951 to 1952, to 6.4 billion West German marks from 1952 to 1953, and to 9.6 billion West German marks from 1953 to 1954, accounting for 34.5 percent of West Germany's total national income. He pointed out that, under these circumstances, the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce occupation fees to no more than 5 percent of national budget income, and in any case not to exceed the amount of 1949, had obviously caused a special and cheerful reaction in West Germany. He said that from 1945 to 1950, the United States, Britain, and France extracted a total of about 22 billion marks from West Germany. In recent years, Western countries have continued to extract large amounts of direct and disguised reparations from West Germany. In September 1952, under pressure from the United States, the Bonn government signed an agreement with Israel, promising to pay Israel 3.5 billion marks in reparations.

    According to the London Conference held on February 27, 1953, West Germany's foreign debt reached 14.5 billion West German marks, including 7.5 billion in post-war debt. These debts do not include war debts, which, according to the head of the West German delegation at the London Conference, amounted to 20 billion West German marks.

    The total value of foreign monopoly capital in West Germany amounts to 12 billion West German marks, with annual profits of no less than 1 billion West German marks. This is a far from complete and cannot be considered an accurate statistic; the actual figure of West Germany's debt may be much higher.

    Prime Minister Grotewohl once again declared on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic that the government of the Democratic Republic will continue to demand that an understanding be reached among the German people.

    Grotewohl's report was interrupted by applause many times.

    The Deputy Prime Ministers, Nuschke, Bolz, and Loch, spoke after him.

    The People's Chamber meeting is continuing.

    TASS, Moscow, August 25th: "Pravda" reporter Naumov reported from Berlin that the German people warmly welcome the results of the talks between the Soviet government and the delegation of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

    Naumov wrote that on August 23, all radio stations in the German Democratic Republic repeatedly broadcast the results of the Moscow talks. In eastern and western Germany, thousands of people turned on their radios to listen to every word of the communique. On that day, newspapers in the democratic sector of Berlin and other cities of the German Democratic Republic published special editions carrying documents and materials on the Moscow talks.

    In Berlin, when the youth of the Free German Youth League appeared on the streets with leaflets, they were immediately surrounded by a large group of people who were eager to see with their own eyes the news they had already heard on the radio.

    Throughout the Republic, people have spontaneously held meetings to discuss the results of the Moscow talks. At a meeting held at the metallurgical plant in the Tar region, labor hero Otto Lauber said: "The Soviet Union has been helping us all these years. This help is particularly significant and important. It helps to build a peace-loving and unified Germany."

    The news of the agreement reached in Moscow spread like lightning throughout West Germany. The publication of these news caused panic among the Bonn reactionary group. The West German News Agency hurriedly issued a statement from "Bonn government officials" in an attempt to confuse the West German people. But the truth cannot be stopped. The working people of West Germany recognized the true situation and welcomed the results of the Moscow talks together with the people of East Germany.

    Naumov's report said that the results of the Moscow talks have become the main topic of all newspapers in eastern and western Germany. "Nuremberg News" published on its front page abstracts of Malenkov's speech, Grotewohl's speech, and comments from around the world on the Soviet government's decision to relieve the German Democratic Republic of its obligation to pay reparations. The newspaper also published the Soviet-German communique with a striking headline.

    Naumov finally said that Berlin journalists pointed out that in the post-war years, nothing had aroused such widespread interest among all levels of the German people as the results of the Moscow talks.

    德意志民主共和国人民议院举行全体会议
    格罗提渥谈苏德会谈的重大意义
    全德人民热烈欢迎苏德莫斯科会谈的结果
    【新华社二十七日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国人民议院于八月二十五日举行第三十五次全体会议。德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在会上报告了苏德莫斯科会谈的经过。
    格罗提渥总理指出苏德莫斯科会谈的结果对于德国人民的巨大的历史重要性。他列举了莫斯科会谈所协议的解决德国问题的各项原则，强调说：“德国未来的面貌将由德国人自己决定，不受任何外国干涉。”
    在谈到苏联为帮助德意志民主共和国提高生活水平而采取的重要的新措施时，他举出德意志民主共和国预算中为维持占领军费用的开支情况如下：一九四九年维持占领军的费用为二十一亿八千二百万马克，占国家收入的百分之十二；一九五○年为十九亿九千三百万马克，占国家收入的百分之十；一九五一年为十九亿九千五百万马克，占国家收入的百分之七点七；一九五二年为十九亿九千五百万马克，占国家收入的百分之六；一九五三年也是十九亿九千五百万马克，占国家收入约百分之五点六。按照苏联政府的决定，一九五四年占领费将减少到十六亿六千万马克，约占全部国家预算收入的百分之五。
    格罗提渥说，根据苏德关于财政与经济问题的协议，德意志民主共和国总共将得益一百三十四亿八千万马克，而并没有受任何形式的财政压力或商业操纵。
    格罗提渥总理然后将上述情况与西德目前的情况作了一个对比。他指出西德占领费支出的发展如下：从一九四九年到一九五○年为四十亿西德马克，从一九五○年到一九五一年为四十六亿西德马克，从一九五一年到一九五二年为七十七亿西德马克，从一九五二年到一九五三年为六十四亿西德马克，从一九五三年到一九五四年为九十六亿西德马克，占西德全部国民收入的百分之三十四点五。他指出，在这种情形下，苏联建议减少占领费到不超过国家预算收入的百分之五，无论如何不应超过一九四九年的数目，显然在西德引起了特别的、欣然的反应。他说：从一九四五年到一九五○年，美国、英国和法国从西德共榨取了约二百二十亿马克。最近几年来，西方国家继续从西德抽取大笔的直接的和变相的赔款。一九五二年九月，波恩政府在美国压力之下，与以色列签订了一个协定，答应付给以色列三十五亿马克的赔款。
    根据一九五三年二月二十七日所召开的伦敦会议，西德外债达一百四十五亿西德马克，包括七十五亿的战后债务。这些债务还不包括战债，据西德代表团团长在伦敦会议上声明，西德战债为数达二百亿西德马克。
    外国垄断资本在西德的财产总值达一百二十亿西德马克，每年的利润不下十亿西德马克。这是个远不完全和不能认为精确的统计，西德负债的实际数字可能还要高得多。
    格罗提渥总理再度代表德意志民主共和国政府声明，民主共和国政府将继续要求在德国人中间达成谅解。
    格罗提渥的报告多次被掌声所打断。
    在他之后发言的有副总理努舍克、博尔茨和洛赫。
    人民议院会议在继续进行中。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：“真理报”记者瑙莫夫自柏林报道说，德国人民热烈欢迎苏联政府与德意志民主共和国政府代表团之间会谈的结果。
    瑙莫夫写道，在八月二十三日，德意志民主共和国的所有广播电台都反复地广播着莫斯科会谈的结果。在德国的东部和西部，成千上万的人们扭开收音机，倾听公报中的每一个字。在那一天，柏林民主区以及德意志民主共和国的其它城市的报纸都出版特刊，刊载关于莫斯科会谈的文件与材料。
    在柏林，当自由德国青年联盟的青年拿着传单在街上出现时，立刻就被一大群人包围起来，这些人急于要亲眼看看他们已经从电台上听见的消息。
    在共和国各地，人们纷纷自动举行集会讨论莫斯科会谈的结果。在塔尔地方的冶金工厂举行的集会上，劳动英雄奥托·劳伯说：“这些年来苏联一直在帮助我们。这次给我们的帮助是特别重大与重要的。这有助于建立一个爱好和平与统一的德国。”
    在莫斯科达成协议的消息像闪电一样传遍了西德。这些消息的公布使波恩反动集团大感恐慌。西德通讯社急忙播发了“波恩政府人士”的声明，企图迷惑西德人民。但是真理是阻挡不住的，西德劳动人民认识了真实情况，并与东德人民一道欢迎莫斯科会谈的结果。
    瑙莫夫的报道说，莫斯科会谈的结果成了德国东部和西部所有报纸的主要论题。“纽伦堡新闻”以首页刊载了马林科夫演说的摘要、格罗提渥的演说，以及世界各地对于苏联政府解除德意志民主共和国支付赔偿义务的决定的评论。该报同时以醒目的标题发表了苏德公报。
    瑙莫夫最后说，柏林新闻界人士指出，在战后年代中，没有一件事曾经像莫斯科会谈的结果一样，在各阶层的德国人民之间引起这样广泛的兴趣。
