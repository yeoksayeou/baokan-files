Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    Over the past three years, the Chinese people have continuously transported large quantities of grain and materials to Korea to assist the Korean people, who have suffered greatly from the ravages of war.

    In January 1951, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace launched a campaign to collect慰劳品 (comfort goods) to慰劳 (express sympathy for) the Chinese and Korean People's soldiers and provide relief to Korean refugees. Subsequently, the China Relief Association, the Red Cross Society of China, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued notices one after another. After that, a vigorous movement to donate慰劳品 (comfort goods) and relief goods was launched throughout the country. The people of the whole country, with a strong sense of internationalist friendship for the Korean people, enthusiastically participated in the donations. Many workers launched a "献工 (labor contribution) movement," enthusiastically using their labor earnings from overfulfilling production tasks to make donations. Farmers in various parts of Northeast China successively dried the vegetables they harvested into dried vegetables or slaughtered livestock and poultry to send to the Korean front. Private industrialists and merchants in various places also actively participated in the donations. Many school students and staff of government offices donated their beloved, exquisite clothes, sweaters, blankets, shoes and other items. In this movement, women and children also contributed their efforts. The enthusiasm of the Chinese people for the Korean people is just as some慰问信 (letters of sympathy) said: "Vast China is your strong rear area; whatever you need, we will supply you."

    With the enthusiastic assistance of the people of the whole country, large quantities of materials were continuously transported to Korea. According to incomplete statistics, from 1950 to the beginning of 1952, the materials donated and sent to Korea by the Chinese people included: 192 carloads and more than 6,000 tons of grain, 20 carloads and more than 3,137,000 catties of meat, 110,000 blankets, 35,000 bolts of cloth, more than 360,000 sets of cotton clothes, 24,000 other various clothes, 400,000 catties of cotton, 150,000 pairs of shoes, more than 818,000 towels, 140,000慰问袋 (comfort bags), and another 1,279,000 boxes of other materials. From November 1950 to January 1952, the total amount of慰问金 (comfort money) donated nationwide reached more than RMB 182.85 billion. In addition, the people of Northeast China, which borders Korea, directly donated to the Korean people in 1950 and 1952: funds equivalent to more than 5,700 tons of grain, 20 carloads of pork, 150,000 towels, 20,000 sets of clothes, 300,000 boxes of cigarettes, 25,000慰问袋 (comfort bags), and a large amount of dry food. At the same time, the Chinese people also invited 21,000 Korean children, who had been rendered homeless by the American invaders, to Northeast China to be fostered.

    When the American invaders were carrying out heinous germ warfare in Korea, the Chinese people not only sent epidemic prevention teams and medical teams, but also transported large quantities of medicines and equipment to the Korean people. In one shipment alone to Pyongyang, Korea, in the first half of 1952, there were: dozens of tons of disinfectants and insecticides, 15 ambulances, 300 liquid sprayers and powder sprayers, 1,000 pairs of rubber boots, 1,000 sets of gas masks, and a large number of vaccines, syringes, experimental medicines, and instruments. These items played a certain role in the Korean people's struggle to smash the American imperialists' germ warfare.

    The great Chinese People's Volunteers not only defended Korea with their own blood, but also economized on food and clothing to help the Korean people restore production and rebuild their homes. According to incomplete statistics, from the second half of 1952 to May 1953, the Chinese People's Volunteers donated more than 9.3 million catties of grain to the Korean people. Commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers also actively helped the Korean people with spring plowing, autumn harvesting, repairing canals, building houses, and planting trees. From late March to mid-May 1952 alone, the Chinese People's Volunteers helped the Korean people cultivate more than 131,000 mu (converted to Chinese 市亩, the same below), sow more than 12,000 mu, reclaim 1,100 mu, fertilize more than 3,000 mu, and deliver 451,100 dan and 98,800 baskets of manure. The officers and soldiers of the entire Chinese People's Volunteers army built water conservancy projects for the Korean people with a high degree of internationalist labor enthusiasm, including many sluice gates, reservoirs, and storage ponds. The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers said: The difficulties of the Korean people are our difficulties, and we have a responsibility to help them overcome various difficulties.

    In the future, the Chinese people will continue to help the Korean people rebuild their homes, restore and develop production, and heal the severe wounds inflicted on them by the war.

    中国人民发挥高度的国际主义友情
    三年来以大批物资援助朝鲜人民
    据新华社讯：在过去三年中，中国人民曾源源不绝地把大批粮食和物资运送到朝鲜去，援助饱经战争灾害的朝鲜人民。
    一九五一年一月，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会发起募集慰劳品慰劳中朝人民战士和救济朝鲜难民的运动，接着，中国人民救济总会、中国红十字会总会、中华全国民主妇女联合会等人民团体相继发出通知。在这以后，轰轰烈烈的捐献慰劳品和救济品运动便在全国范围内展开了。全国人民以对朝鲜人民十分关切的国际主义友情，踊跃参加捐献。许多工人为了以超额完成生产任务的劳动所得来捐献，热烈地开展了献工运动。东北各地农民纷纷将自己收获的蔬菜晒成菜干或宰杀了家畜、家禽送往朝鲜前线。各地私营工商业者也踊跃参加捐献。许多学校的学生和机关工作人员献出了自己心爱的精致的衣服、毛衣、毯子、鞋子等物品。在这个运动中，妇女和儿童们也贡献了力量。中国人民对朝鲜人民的这种热情，正如有些慰问信上所说的：“广阔的中国就是你们强大的后方，你们要什么我们供给你们什么。”
    在全国人民热情的援助下，大批的物资源源不断地运往朝鲜。根据不完全的统计：从一九五○年到一九五二年初这一期间内，中国人民捐赠和送到朝鲜的物资计有：粮食一百九十二车皮又六千多吨，肉类二十车皮又三百一十三万七千多斤，毛毯十一万条，布三万五千匹，棉衣三十六万多套，其他各种衣服二万四千件，棉花四十万斤，鞋十五万双，毛巾八十一万八千多条，慰问袋十四万个，另外还有其他物资一百二十七万九千多箱。从一九五○年十一月到一九五二年一月，全国捐献的慰问金共达人民币一千八百二十八亿五千多万元。此外，和朝鲜毗邻的我国东北地区人民在一九五○年和一九五二年两年中，直接捐赠朝鲜人民的有：价值相等于五千七百多吨粮食的款项，二十车皮猪肉，十五万条毛巾，两万套衣服，三十万盒香烟，二万五千个慰问袋，以及大批干粮。同时，中国人民还邀请了被美国侵略者害得无家可归的二万一千名朝鲜儿童来到中国东北地区，代为抚养。
    当美国侵略者在朝鲜进行万恶的细菌战时，中国人民不仅派出了防疫队和医疗队，而且运送了大批药品和器材给朝鲜人民。仅在一九五二年上半年某一次运到朝鲜平壤的就有：消毒剂和杀虫剂数十吨，救护车十五辆，液体喷雾器和粉末喷雾器三百个，橡胶皮靴一千双，防毒服装一千套，另外还有大量的疫苗、注射器、试验药品和仪器等。这些物品，在朝鲜人民粉碎美帝国主义细菌战的斗争中起了一定的作用。
    伟大的中国人民志愿军，不仅用自己的鲜血保卫住朝鲜，同时还节衣缩食援助朝鲜人民恢复生产、重建家园。据不完全的统计，一九五二年下半年到一九五三年五月，中国人民志愿军就捐出了九百三十多万斤粮食给朝鲜人民。中国人民志愿军指挥员战斗员还积极帮助朝鲜人民春耕、秋收、修渠、盖房、种树。仅一九五二年三月下旬至五月中旬，中国人民志愿军战士们就帮助朝鲜人民耕地十三万一千多亩（折合我国市亩，下同），播种一万二千多亩，开荒一千一百亩，施肥三千多亩，送粪四十五万一千一百担又九万八千八百多筐。中国人民志愿军全军干部、战士以高度的国际主义劳动热情为朝鲜人民修建水利工程，其中包括许多水闸、水库和蓄水池。中国人民志愿军战士们说：朝鲜人民的困难，就是我们的困难，我们有责任来帮助他们克服各种困难。
    今后，中国人民将继续不断地帮助朝鲜人民重建家园，恢复与发展生产，医治战争带给他们的严重创伤。“
