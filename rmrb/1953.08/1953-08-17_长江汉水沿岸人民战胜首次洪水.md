Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th: The people along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the Han River, to protect the harvest and the safety of their lives, have fought the flood on the Yangtze River and the Han River dikes for several days and nights, and have now overcome the highest flood in four years on the Yangtze River and eighteen years on the Han River. At present, the people along the rivers are closely monitoring the changes in the water situation and continuing to inspect and reinforce the dikes.

At the end of July and the beginning of August, there were continuous rains in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the upper reaches of the Han River. The water level in the Shashi area of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River suddenly rose to 43.15 meters, exceeding the warning level by 0.15 meters. From the 4th, the Han River and its tributaries, the Tang River, the Bai River, and the East Jing River, generally exceeded the warning water level. After heavy rains on the 5th and 6th, the water level of the Han River from Zhongxiang County to Hanchuan County, a 289-kilometer-long section of the river, generally approached the highest water level in the past 18 years. In many sections such as Yuekou, Shayang, Xiantao, and Taozhubu, the water level exceeded the highest water level in the past 18 years by more than 4 centimeters. As a result, the riverbanks were fraught with dangers, and dozens of dike sections formed dangerous situations such as flood peaks, and dike seepage. However, this flood was finally overcome by the people along the rivers who had rich experience in fighting floods. Before the flood arrived, the people along the river generally inspected the Yangtze River dikes, repaired the hidden dangers, stored a large amount of flood prevention materials, and organized a strict flood prevention team. After the flood arrived, the people along the river, under the leadership of the local people's government and the CPC Party Committee, went to the dike in an organized manner to rescue and protect it. In the areas of Longtouguai, Daijiayuan, Maiwangzui, and Zhaojiatai in the East Jing River, a tributary of the Han River, the flood was level with the top of the enclosure dikes. Under the leadership of Rao Mintai, deputy commissioner of the Jingzhou Special Zone, and the responsible cadres of the Party and government of various counties, the local people worked around the clock to build three sub-dikes in a row. In the most tense sections of the water situation, all the staff of the Party and government leading organs along the river, the People's Liberation Army stationed troops, etc., all went to the dike to rescue and protect the dike together with the people along the river, so that the dike body was saved from danger. From the 12th, the flood of the Yangtze River and the Han River began to recede. The water level of the Han River and its tributaries has generally receded below the guaranteed water level, and the water level in the Shashi area of the Yangtze River has receded below the warning water level.

At present, the people along the Yangtze River and the Han River are watching the changes in the water situation with a hundredfold vigilance to prevent collapses and landslides due to the receding water, and to ensure the final victory of the flood control and flood prevention work. The Joint Headquarters for Flood Control and Drought Resistance Production in the South Central Region has instructed the flood control agencies along the Yangtze River and the Han River to earnestly summarize the experience gained in winning the flood control and flood prevention work this time. It also requires all localities to conduct a general inspection of the dike body after the water recedes, seize the time to repair hidden dangers and loopholes, and make all preparations for winning the flood of the entire flood season, which will extend to the end of October.

    长江汉水沿岸人民战胜首次洪水
    【新华社武汉十六日电】长江中游和汉水两岸人民，为保卫丰收和生命安全，在沿江大堤上和洪水搏斗了数昼夜，现已战胜长江四年来和汉水十八年来最高的一次洪水。目前，江河沿岸人民正密切注意水情变化，继续查堤加工。
    七月底八月初，长江中游、汉水上游连日降雨，长江中游沙市一带水位突涨至四十三点一五公尺，超过警戒水位零点一五公尺。汉水及其支流唐河、白河、东荆河四日起普遍超出警戒水位，五六两日大雨后，汉水从钟祥县到汉川县一段长达二百八十九公里的河道，水位普遍接近十八年来最高水位。岳口、沙洋、仙桃、陶朱埠等不少地段都超过十八年来最高水位四公寸以上。因而江河沿岸险象环生，好几十处堤段形成洪水平顶、堤身浸漏等险象。但这次洪水终为江河沿岸富有和洪水搏斗经验的人民战胜了。这次洪水来到之前，沿岸人民就普遍检查了沿江大堤，修好了险患，储备了大量的防汛器材，并组织了严密的防汛队伍。洪水到来后，沿河人民又在当地人民政府和中共党委会领导下，有组织地上堤抢险防护。汉水支流东荆河的龙头拐、戴家垸、脉旺嘴、赵家台等地洪水和围堤平顶，当地人民在荆州专区副专员饶民太和各县党、政负责干部领导下，不分昼夜，一连做了三次子埂。水情最为紧张的地段，沿江所有党、政领导机关的工作人员、人民解放军驻军等都全部上堤和沿岸人民一道抢险护堤，使堤身转危为安。从十二日起，长江、汉水的洪水开始退落，汉水及其支流的水位已普遍退落到保证水位以下，长江沙市一带水位已退落到警戒水位以下。
    目前长江、汉水沿岸人民正百倍警惕地注视着水情变化，以防因退水而发生崩挫、脱坡等现象，以保证防洪防汛工作的最后胜利。中南区防汛抗旱生产联合总指挥部已指示长江、汉水沿岸防汛机构，认真总结此次防洪防汛工作获得胜利的经验。并要求各地在退水后普遍进行一次堤身检查，抓紧时间修补隐患和漏洞，为战胜将延至十月底的整个汛期的洪水做好一切准备工作。
