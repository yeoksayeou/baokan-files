    Broadcasting Station Work in Basic Construction Sites in the Northeast Region

    Broadcasting station work in basic construction sites in the Northeast region began in a few key construction sites around May 1952. Over the past year, all major construction sites and larger worker dormitories in Northeast China have also established broadcasting stations, with a total of 5,580 high-volume loudspeakers of various types. After the establishment of broadcasting stations, they have played a certain role in raising the political awareness of workers and encouraging them to complete construction plans on schedule and ahead of schedule. Therefore, workers call broadcasting stations "air mobilization platforms" or "air clubs," and they have become an indispensable part of workers' production and recreational life.

    The Significance and Role of Establishing Broadcasting Stations in Basic Construction Sites

    Basic construction site work, apart from some ground-level operations, mostly involves open-air, three-dimensional work, with high-altitude operations dozens of feet above the ground and deep foundation operations over ten feet deep. The construction area is extremely wide, the number of workers is large and dispersed, and there is a lot of noise from various operations. To adapt to this characteristic and carry out propaganda and mobilization work to encourage workers' enthusiasm for production, in addition to making full use of forms such as blackboards and cartoons for propaganda, it is necessary to universally establish broadcasting stations for propaganda and mobilization.

    The role of broadcasting stations is as follows:

    First, it can concentrate propaganda forces to serve the main projects in the construction site. Various projects in basic construction engineering are closely related. If one project cannot be completed on schedule or the project quality does not meet the standards, it will affect the progress and quality of the entire construction site. Therefore, the broadcasting station must grasp the key projects in the construction site and concentrate on using broadcasting tools to carry out propaganda and mobilization work in production. For example, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central Government required the concrete engineering team of construction site ○190 to strictly guarantee quality standards when pouring the foundation of the most important project in the entire project. At this time, the construction site propaganda department decided to concentrate the loudspeakers from minor work sections around the main project, conducting on-site mobilization and technical guidance at any time, introducing tips, spreading good news, and reading congratulatory messages, so that workers were always full of energy throughout the entire project, concerned about project quality, and spontaneously put forward rationalization proposals. This not only ensured that the project could be completed on schedule, but also that the quality reached 100%.

    Second, because oral broadcasting has the characteristics of mobilization and militancy, it can quickly and timely disseminate production experience and promote production competitions. In many construction sites, broadcasting stations are used to promptly announce the competition results of various places to the entire workforce and indicate the direction of advancement during labor competitions. For example, when a large construction site began pouring concrete foundations, it was discovered that a small number of workers were neglecting quality. Therefore, the broadcasting station carried out propaganda on the importance of quality, introduced the model deeds of Li Shengkun and Hao Jinming, and called on everyone to learn from them, which aroused workers' attention to project quality. Ma Shizhong, a worker in the second shift, discovered a crack in the formwork leaking slurry. He immediately took off his hat and blocked the crack. For example, when the Xia Shaodong team of a certain construction site was working on the second floor of the power plant, they needed six days to complete the task according to the instructions. Later, the broadcasting station mobilized them to improve labor organization and complete the plan ahead of schedule. The team immediately held a team meeting to discuss, adjust the labor force, and prepare for various tasks. The next day, Xia Shaodong proposed a plan to complete the six-day task in four days, and then other teams also proposed challenge conditions. This sparked a competition upsurge, and the entire project was completed ahead of schedule.

    Third, through the broadcasting station, the recreational life of the construction site was enlivened, and political and current affairs propaganda was regularized. The broadcasting station regularly broadcast current affairs and various special programs from the Central People's Broadcasting Station, which not only improved the workers' political awareness and patriotic labor enthusiasm, but also cultivated the habit of many workers to listen to the broadcast on time. Many workers listen to current affairs reports during lunch breaks and after work, learn to sing from the radio, and listen to Peking opera and drama. One day, after they listened to the report of the returning representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers, a certain team of workers was so moved that they worked in the heavy rain. The team leader persuaded them to avoid the rain, but they said that the volunteers were fighting so hard at the front, so it was nothing to be drenched in a little rain.

    Experience has proven that wherever the broadcasting station can play the above-mentioned roles, the workers' work, rest, and recreational life are normalized, and the attendance rate and work efficiency are also improved.

    Preliminary Experience in Broadcasting Station Work

    The broadcasting station should have a sound organizational structure. The broadcasting station is a new type of mass propaganda tool that requires systematic organizational leadership. At present, the business work of each construction site broadcasting station is led by the trade union's culture and education committee. Generally, there is one technician and one broadcaster. The director of the broadcasting station is concurrently held by a member of the trade union's culture and education committee, and the expenses are paid from the trade union's culture and education funds. The broadcasting station has editorial, broadcasting, technical, and communication groups. Engineers, technicians, and active workers are recruited to participate in the communication group work. Attention is also paid to training a considerable number of amateur broadcasters and technicians to ensure that the broadcasting station can work day and night. In order for the broadcasting station to carry out broadcasting in accordance with the progress of the project and closely cooperate with the central work, a regular meeting system must be established to regularly study and summarize experience and arrange the work for the next stage.

    The work of the broadcasting station must be carried out under the specific leadership of the Party committee and with the help of the administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League. At present, the Party committees of various construction sites in Northeast China can generally discuss the work of the broadcasting station on time. For example, after the monthly engineering task is formulated, the Party committee promptly explains the requirements for the progress of the project to the broadcasting station staff, points out the key problems in the construction, so that the broadcasting station can formulate a broadcasting plan. For example, in October of last year, in order to strive to complete the project ten days ahead of schedule and exceed the target, the secretary of the construction site Party committee, the director of the construction site, the chairman of the trade union, and the comrades in charge of the broadcasting station jointly studied the broadcasting content; the Party committee provided timely and specific leadership, regularly inspected the work of the broadcasting station, and promptly corrected any deviations. Another aspect of the specific leadership of the Party committee is to use the broadcasting station to assign work to propagandists, regularly send reporters and propagandists to the broadcasting station to broadcast, and give full play to the role of the broadcasting station in mass propaganda and education. When construction site ○190 was pouring the foundation of the main electrical room, the reporter made sixteen reports to the construction site, which had a great effect on encouraging the construction site staff to complete the task ahead of schedule.

    The broadcasting station should appropriately arrange the broadcasting content and time according to the construction site conditions and the needs of the staff. The correct allocation of broadcasting time and the appropriate arrangement of broadcasting programs are one of the important organizational tasks of the broadcasting station. In summer and autumn, the fixed broadcasting time is three times a day. The first time is from 6:00 to 6:30 in the morning, listening to the news programs of the Northeast People's Broadcasting Station and the Central People's Broadcasting Station; the second broadcasting time is from 11:30 in the morning to 1:30 in the afternoon. In addition to rebroadcasting the basic construction programs of the Municipal People's Broadcasting Station, the rest of the time is organized by the broadcasting station to broadcast its own construction site programs; the third time is from 3:30 to 5:00 in the afternoon, conducting on-site speeches and political education (night shifts have separate regulations). In addition, during construction time, motivational speeches of five to ten minutes can be carried out according to the progress of the project. The staff reported that carrying out mobilization during construction time does not hinder work, because timely mobilization and commendation can encourage labor emotions.

    In order to make broadcasting more effective, the program arrangement must be flexible and diverse, and short and concise literary and artistic forms should be used as much as possible. The broadcasting station should regularly organize workers to perform programs at the broadcasting station through the cultural and educational committees of each engineering team. Efforts should also be made to obtain the help and guidance of the Municipal People's Broadcasting Station. The Shenyang Municipal People's Broadcasting Station has helped construction sites hold broadcaster training classes, which has been very successful in improving the business capabilities of broadcasters.

    At a time when the country is carrying out large-scale basic construction, we should further exert the role of broadcasting and use broadcasting stations to carry out production propaganda to encourage labor enthusiasm. When disseminating advanced experience, we should implement the engineering construction policy of "good, fast, economical, and safe" in order to complete the national basic construction tasks. To do this, the editorial department of the broadcasting station must be closely linked to production and must be good at focusing its attention on considering the main problems in factory life; the Party organizations and trade union organizations of enterprises must regularly lead the broadcast, be good at directing the broadcast content, and pay attention to the work content of the broadcast team. The propaganda departments of the Party committees of various provinces and cities and the Party committees of basic construction sites must strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the broadcasting station, specifically help the trade union organization study the broadcasting work of the construction site, send outstanding propagandists to work in the broadcasting station, and establish a construction site propaganda network, hire excellent technicians to actively participate in the technical propaganda work of the broadcasting station and be absorbed as propagandists or reporters, and promptly summarize the experience of the broadcasting station. Only in this way can the role of the construction site broadcasting station be better exerted.

    东北区基本建设工地中的广播站工作
    东北区基本建设工地中的广播站工作，于一九五二年五月间，已在少数重点工地中建立起来了。一年来，全东北各大工地，和规模较大的工人宿舍，也都建立了广播站。各种类型的高音喇叭共五千五百八十台。广播站建立后，在提高工人们的政治觉悟、鼓动工人们按期和提前完成工程计划方面是起了一定的作用。因此工人们称广播站为“空中鼓动台”或“空中俱乐部”；它成为工人们生产和文娱生活中不可缺少的部分。
    基本建设工地建立广播站的意义和作用
    基本建设工地工作除一部分平地操作外，大部均系露天的立体作业；有几十丈高的高空操作和十余丈深的深基础操作。建筑面积极为宽阔，工人数量庞大而又分散，加之各种的操作声又很喧闹嘈杂。为了适应这一特点，开展宣传鼓动工作，鼓舞工人生产热情，除了尽量利用黑板报、漫画等形式进行宣传外，就必须普遍建立广播站进行宣传鼓动。
    广播站的作用如下：
    第一、它能集中宣传力量为工地中的主要工程服务。基本建设工程中各工程是相互密切联系的，如果有一种工程不能按期完成，或工程质量不能合乎标准，就会影响整个工地的工程进度和质量。因此，广播站必须抓住工地中的关键性的工程，集中利用广播工具进行生产中的宣传鼓动工作。例如中央重工业部要求○一九○工地混凝土工程队在浇灌全部工程中最主要工程基础时，严格保证质量标准。这时，工地宣传部门决定把次要工段上的喇叭集中到主要工程周围，随时进行工地鼓动及技术指导，介绍窍门、传捷报、念贺信，使工人在整个工程中始终精神饱满，关心工程质量，自动地提出合理化建议。这样不但保证了工程能够按期完成，而且质量也都达到了百分之百的标准。
    第二、因为口头广播具有鼓动性和战斗性的特点，所以它能迅速及时地传播生产经验，推动生产竞赛。许多工地在劳动竞赛中，利用广播站把各地的竞赛成绩及时地向全体公布，指示前进的方向。如大型工地在开始浇灌混凝土基础时，发现少数工人有忽视质量的现象，于是广播站就进行重视质量的宣传，介绍李盛坤、郝金明的模范事迹，号召大家向他们学习，因而引起了工人们对工程质量的重视。第二班工人马世忠发现模板裂缝淌浆，他立即摘下帽子，把缝口堵上。又如某工地夏绍东小组担任砌机电厂二楼的工作时，按照指示图表需六天完成，后来广播站动员他们改进劳动组织，提前完成计划。该组立刻召开小组会进行讨论，调整了劳动力，做好了各种准备工作。第二天，夏绍东提出六天任务四天完成的计划，接着其他小组也提出了应战条件。因而掀起了竞赛的热潮，整个工程提前完成了任务。
    第三、通过广播站，活跃了工地的文娱生活，并使政治时事宣传经常化。广播站按时转播中央人民广播电台的时事和各种特别的节目，这样不仅提高了工人的政治觉悟和爱国劳动热情，而且还养成了许多工人按时收听广播的习惯。很多工人在中午休息时和下班后收听时事报告，跟电台学唱歌，收听京戏、话剧。有一天，当他们收听了中国人民志愿军归国代表的报告后，某班工人感动得冒着大雨工作，班长劝他们避雨，他们说志愿军在前方打仗那样艰苦，咱挨点雨浇算不了啥。
    经验证明：凡是广播站能够发挥了上述作用的地方，工人们的工作、休息和文娱生活都正常了，出勤率和工作效率也提高了。
    广播站工作中的几点初步经验
    广播站应有健全的组织机构。广播站是一种新型的群众宣传工具，需要进行有系统的组织领导工作。目前，各工地广播站的业务工作，由工会文教委员会领导。一般的设机务一人和广播员一人，广播站主任由工会文教委员兼任，费用由工会文教费项下开支。广播站下设编辑、广播、机务和通讯等组。吸收工程师、技术员、工人积极分子参加通讯组工作。并注意培养有相当数目的业余广播员和机务人员，保证广播站的工作能够日夜进行。为使广播站工作能按照工程进度和紧密配合中心工作进行广播，必须建立定期的会议制度，经常研究和总结经验及布置下一阶段的工作。
    广播站的工作必须在党委具体领导和行政、工会、青年团的帮助下进行。目前，东北各工地党委一般地能做到按时讨论广播站的工作。如每月工程任务制订后，及时地向广播站人员交代工程进度的要求，指出施工中的关键问题，以便广播站制订广播计划。如鞍山轧钢建筑工地在去年十月份为了争取提前十天超额完成工程任务，工地党委书记、工地主任、工会主席与广播站负责同志共同研究了广播内容；党委给予及时和具体的领导，经常检查广播站工作，发现偏差就及时纠正。党委具体领导的另一个方面，就是运用广播站对宣传员布置工作，经常派报告员、宣传员到广播站广播，充分发挥广播站的群众宣传教育的作用。○一九○工地浇灌主电室基础时，报告员曾到工地作了十六次报告，对于鼓动工地职工提前完成任务有着很大的成效。
    广播站要按照工地情况和职工需要，适当安排广播内容和时间。广播时间的正确分配，和广播节目的适当安排，是广播站的重要组织工作之一。在夏、秋两季，每天固定广播时间是三次。第一次是早晨六点至六点半，收听东北人民广播电台和中央人民广播电台的新闻节目；第二次播音时间是上午十一点半至下午一点半，除转播市人民广播电台的基本建设节目外，其余时间由广播站组织本工地节目进行广播；第三次是下午三点半至五点，进行工地讲话及政治教育（夜班时间另有规定）。此外，在施工时间，可以按照工程进度，进行五分钟至十分钟的鼓动讲话。职工反映在施工时间进行鼓动并不妨碍工作，因为及时的鼓动表扬，可以鼓舞劳动情绪。
    为使广播得到更大成效，编排节目必须灵活多样，要尽量采用短小精悍的文艺形式。广播站应经常通过各工程队的文教委员组织工人到广播站演出节目。并设法取得市人民广播电台的帮助和指导。沈阳市人民广播电台曾帮助工地举办广播员训练班，对于提高广播员业务能力很有成绩。
    在国家进行大规模基本建设的时候，我们应该进一步发挥广播的作用，运用广播站来进行生产宣传，以鼓舞劳动热情。在传播先进经验时，应贯彻“又好、又快、又省、安全”的工程建设方针，以便完成国家的基本建设任务。为了做到这一点，广播站的编辑部必须和生产取得密切联系，必须善于集中自己的注意力去考虑工厂生活中的主要问题；企业的党组织和工会组织必须经常领导播送，善于指示播送题材和注意播音组的工作内容。各省、市党委宣传部和基本建设工地的党委必须加强对广播站的政治思想领导，具体帮助工会组织研究本工地的广播工作，把优秀的宣传员派到广播站工作，并建立工地宣传网，聘请优秀的技术人员积极参加广播站的技术宣传工作并吸收为宣传员或报告员，及时地总结广播站的经验。只有如此，才能更好地发挥工地广播站的作用。
