    Repatriated Australian POW Reveals
    American Planes Continuously Strafed American and British POWs
    [Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch] Repatriated enemy prisoners of war admitted that the real threat to their lives while in captivity came from the continuous bombing and strafing by American planes.
    Repatriated Australian soldier Holles said to a United Press reporter on the 9th, "American planes strafed Allied prisoners of war every night during the six months that Allied prisoners of war marched north to POW camps in North Korea."
    Holles said, "They came to strafe us every night for six months. When these planes saw any activity or lights in the villages, they would fly over and strafe those places." Several prisoners of war died under the strafing of American light bombers.
    Holles said, "It's a terrible thing to watch your own planes come and strafe you."

    被遣返的澳大利亚战俘透露
    美机连续扫射美英战俘的罪行
    【新华社十二日讯】被遣返的对方战俘承认，他们在被俘期间所受到的对于生命的真正威胁，是美国飞机的连续轰炸扫射。
    已被遣返的澳大利亚士兵何礼士九日对合众社记者说，“在联军战俘向北行军去北朝鲜的战俘营的六个月期间内，美国飞机每夜都在扫射联军战俘。”
    何礼士说，“它们在六个月期间每夜都来扫射我们。这些飞机看见村子里有什么活动或灯光，它们就飞来扫射这些地方。”若干战俘就死于美国轻轰炸机的扫射之下。
    何礼士说，“眼看着你自己的飞机飞来扫射真是糟糕透顶的事。”
