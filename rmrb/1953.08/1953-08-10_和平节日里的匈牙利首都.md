On the European continent, there is an outstanding "beauty," the blue Danube River.

On the blue Danube River, there is a brilliant "pearl," the magnificent Budapest.

In early June of 1953, to attend the World Peace Council meeting, we came to peaceful, beautiful Budapest—the capital of the Hungarian People's Republic.

We stayed at the "Grand Hotel" on Margaret Island in the center of the Danube River. Hungarian poets call this small island "Aquatic Wonderland" and "People's Island Paradise." Indeed, it is a very attractive place. Look at those ancient buildings, those exquisitely decorated workers' clubs, new-style sports grounds, swimming pools, and open-air concert stages and dance floors, like countless colorful flowers, scattered across the lush green and flowered island. Every evening, after work, laborers and young men and women freely stroll and chat on the long dikes and in the gardens, singing and dancing to their hearts' content....

Margaret Island seems like a giant eagle in flight, its left wing is the "Republic" Bridge, connecting the ancient city of Buda; its right wing is the Stalin Bridge, close to the industrial district of Pest. The green and flat Pest plains face the forested and undulating Buda hills. Looking far away, the cliffs of Gellért Hill stand tall and majestic on the riverbank, and looking far away, Castle Hill, the witness of countless great battles against foreign invasions, seems to be smiling and contemplating with satisfaction.

On a clear morning, the morning mist disappears, and the new-style steamer "Gorky" carries a boatload of guests—peace fighters from various countries—cruising the Danube River. The ship sounds its happy whistle, advancing along the silver ribbon-like river, passing under iron cable bridges and steel suspension bridges erected on the river like scales. Factory districts with rows of chimneys and adjacent historical sites are neatly and harmoniously distributed on both banks.

Anyone who knows the history of Budapest will deeply understand how much of the laboring people's blood, sweat, and wisdom it took to build this beautiful and magnificent city that now appears before people! Therefore, people cherish and love it even more.

During the war years, the Hitler bandits severely damaged Budapest. Many valuable ancient artistic buildings were destroyed, and more than 70 percent of the residences were damaged, some completely burned down. However, now, walking around the city, it is not easy to find unrepaired houses. Four of the five bridges connecting Buda and Pest that were destroyed have been repaired, and a new, large-scale Stalin Bridge has also been built. The famous ancient castle on the elliptical highland of the steep Castle Hill is also being rushed to repair; during the excavation, many precious ancient building relics buried underground were discovered. Among them are palace halls, ancient city walls, stone tablets inscribed with words, and independent watchtowers. Those light gray and light yellow walls and roofs, rebuilt according to the original appearance in order to restore the ancient scenery, have enhanced the beauty of the city. For example, the newly completed Hungarian National Museum not only preserves the architectural style of classical Batteiger style, but also has scientific modern equipment. Standing in front of this magnificent museum, one cannot help but be reminded of 1848, when the great freedom fighter Petőfi recited his famous poem "National Song," full of patriotic enthusiasm, on the high steps of this stone staircase during the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution.

Budapest has not only healed the wounds of war but also completed many new and large-scale "socialist construction projects" in the short few years after liberation. The major project of eliminating the difference between the urban area and the suburbs of Budapest is proceeding smoothly; now the entire suburbs have been connected into one piece. The Five-Year Plan allocated 168 million forints (Hungarian currency) to lay water pipes and sewers in the suburbs. Under the direct guidance of the Party and the trade union, a large number of comfortable three- to seven-story dormitories—"Workers' Homes"—have been built in many concentrated areas of workers in the near suburbs.

We visited the workers' residences on Váci Road. In the past, workers called this road "Suffering Street," where they often gathered to march and demonstrate against the cruel exploitation of factory owners and capitalists. At that time, a family of four or five workers only had one small room. But now most workers' homes have three rooms, with bathrooms, gas supply, and heating equipment. The residences are surrounded by clusters of flowers and trees, and gardens with exquisitely made tables and chairs, and the gardens have swimming pools and sports fields. On the long row of neat open windows, pretty lace curtains flutter like flags, and the healthy apple faces of children peek out from the windows, waving and smiling at us, as if telling the guests about their happy childhood.

When the train enters Budapest, several conspicuous white cement high columns can be seen from a distance, evenly rising above all the buildings. The steel arms of the "Iron Bull" large crane are calmly placing thirty-ton steel and cement beams. This is the National Sports Center of Hungary, which the Hungarian people are proud of—the People's Stadium with a capacity of 100,000 spectators. After its completion, it will be one of the largest and most perfectly equipped new-style sports grounds in the world.

Budapest has many magnificent monuments, but the most outstanding and most praised and admired by people is the "Goddess of Liberty" towering on the top of Gellért Hill—the tomb of Soviet martyrs, the liberators of the Hungarian land and people. Every revolutionary fighter who comes to Budapest comes to this tomb with infinite respect to mourn and offer flowers. You see, under the bronze giant statue of a Soviet Guards soldier several feet high, there are two large wreaths placed side by side: one is presented by the Soviet delegation headed by Tikhonov, and the other is presented by the Chinese delegation headed by Guo Moruo. At the top of the central memorial tower stands a solemn and simple bronze statue of the "God of Peace," holding high a branch of olive symbolizing peace with both hands. On her left is a fearless warrior subduing a poisonous snake, and on her right is a new youth holding a torch to welcome the light; the walls of the tomb are engraved with images of the Hungarian working people building and defending a peaceful life. All of this sings praises of the immortal feats of the Soviet martyrs and expresses the Hungarian people's eternal gratitude and firm vows to the benefactors who saved their lives.

The Hungarian people are warm, down-to-earth, love labor, and are full of vitality. This is the common feeling of people who have been to Hungary. Whether it is the tense and happy situation seen when visiting factories and rural areas, or the high sense of responsibility and frankness seen when working and interacting with them, it is convincing.

What impressed us most was their warm welcome and gracious hospitality to peace envoys from all over the world. Soviet comrade Krutov wrote: "Our Hungarian friends are excellent and hospitable hosts!"

Wherever the delegates appeared, the masses came out to welcome them, flocking to shake hands, greet, and say hello. School choirs, factory brass bands, and rural dance troupes are all busy performing their most beautiful and moving programs for the guests. The working people treated the guests with fresh fruits just picked from their orchards, and presented the guests with long-prepared noble gifts such as "peace packages," "peace boxes," and "peace baskets," filled with all kinds of gifts: exquisite embroidered tablecloths, napkins, handkerchiefs, and many kind and touching letters, and even their own photos and the best crop selections.

The residents of Ivándárt village wrote enthusiastically in a letter signed by the entire village to Guo Moruo: "Come to our village as a guest, Comrade Guo Moruo! We have prepared strong wine and big red foreign plums waiting for you. We have practiced the band and dance troupe and will go outside the village to welcome you...." Balotaris Joseph, the leader of the Red Star assembly group of the "April 4th Machine Factory" in Budapest, also said in a letter to Guo Moruo: "We warmly welcome the peace representatives of the great Chinese people to the capital of our motherland. We are grateful that you have brought the respect of the Chinese people. We tell you with pride and honor that our group has completed the task one week ahead of schedule with the best quality and made a batch of new-style air compressors to be shipped to China...." It is forever unforgettable that on June 19, a celebration meeting attended by hundreds of thousands of people was held on the square named after the great Hungarian national hero Kossuth. When the Chinese delegation entered the venue, the crowd warmly applauded and cheered "China! Peace!"; and when the Chinese representative paid tribute to the Hungarian working people and their leaders at the meeting in the name of the Chinese people, the whole venue, like a forest of colorful flags, was raised and waved, and the whole venue rang with tsunami-like cheers: "Mao Zedong!—Mao Zedong!"

The Hungarian people call the days during the World Peace Council meeting their "Peace Festival." During these days full of friendship and joy, the beautiful Budapest is even more beautiful. The three-color Hungarian flag, the bright red Soviet flag, and the blue peace flag are flying all over the city. Slogans of various kinds defending peace or paying tribute to peace fighters are hung high in the streets and squares. Photos of world-famous peace fighters are hung or placed in the glass windows of shops and clubs: Curie, Fadeyev, Soong Ching Ling, Guo Moruo, Nenni, Ikuo Oyama, and Kitchlew. Wherever you go, you can see or hear a loud word—"Béke (Peace)," which shows that the Hungarian people love peace. Just as the sentence familiar to every Hungarian says: "For the great cause of peace, wherever struggle and sacrifice are needed, the Hungarian people will definitely go there."

On this blue June night, looking from Margaret Island to both banks, Budapest is even more like a glittering pearl! The countless red stars symbolizing the victory of labor are shining on the rooftops like stars in the sky. Small motorboats on the beautiful Danube River carry people who sing heartily and fly across the wide river. The singing is getting more and more energetic, and the melody is getting more and more moving:

My peaceful motherland—Hungary,
Mother of my life—Hungary.
We give you our youth and hope!
We defend you with labor and struggle!…

### 和平节日里的匈牙利首都

    和平节日里的匈牙利首都
    朱子奇
    欧洲大陆上有一个出色的“美女”，是蓝色的多瑙河。
    蓝色的多瑙河上有一颗灿烂的“珍珠”，是壮丽的布达佩斯。
    一九五三年的六月初，为了参加世界和平理事会会议，我们来到了和平的、美丽的布达佩斯——匈牙利人民共和国的首都。
    我们住在多瑙河河中心马尔基特岛上的“大旅社”。匈牙利的诗人们把这座小岛称为“水中仙境”和“人民的岛上乐园”。的确，这是非常引人入胜的地方，你瞧，那些古代的建筑物，那些装修得极为精美的工人俱乐部、新式运动场、游泳池，以及露天演奏台和跳舞场，有如无数彩色的花朵，散开在盖满翠绿和鲜花的小岛上。每到黄昏时分，下工后的劳动者们和青年男女们，在长堤上、在花园里，自由地漫步谈笑，尽情地歌唱和舞蹈……。
    马尔基特岛，仿佛一只巨大的雄鹰在飞翔着，它的左翅是“共和国”大桥，连接着古城布达；它的右翅是斯大林大桥，紧靠着工业区佩斯。绿油油的平坦开阔的佩斯大原野，面对着布满森林的起伏的布达山峰。远远望去，格列尔山的峭壁垂直地威武地耸立在河岸上，远远望去，那经历过无数次反抗外族侵略的伟大战斗的见证人——卡斯尔山的岩石，好像在欣慰地微笑和沉思。
    晴朗的早晨，晨雾消失了，“高尔基号”的新式汽轮载着满船的客人——各国和平战士漫游多瑙河。轮船鸣着快乐的汽笛声，沿着银色长带似的河流前进，穿过一座座天平般架设在河上的铁索大桥与钢骨吊桥，烟囱林立的工厂区和毗连不绝的名胜古迹，整齐而协和地分布在两岸。
    知道布达佩斯的历史的人，就会深刻懂得：如今出现在人们面前的这座优美而辉煌的城市，是由多少劳动人民的血汗与智慧修建起来的呵！因而，人们也就更加珍视它和喜爱它。
    在战争的年月里，希特勒匪徒曾严重地破坏了布达佩斯，许多有价值的古代艺术建筑物都被炸毁，住宅的百分之七十以上都受到损害，有的完全被焚烧掉。但是，现在你走遍全城也不易发觉未修的房屋了。连接布达和佩斯的五座被毁的桥已修好四座，并且还新建了一座工程宏大的斯大林大桥。在险峻的卡斯尔山的椭圆高地上的著名古堡，也正在赶修中；在开掘时，发现了不少埋藏在地下的珍贵的古代建筑物遗迹。其中有宫殿的厅堂、古式的城壁以及刻有文字的石碑与独立的了望台等。那些为了恢复古代景色，按照原样修建起来的带浅灰色和淡黄色的墙壁与楼顶，增加了市容的美化。如刚完工不久的匈牙利国立博物馆，既保存着古典的巴特哥式的建筑艺术风格，又有科学的现代设备。站在这座雄伟的博物馆前面，不禁会使人想起一八四八年匈牙利革命爆发时，伟大的争取自由战士裴多菲，曾在这石阶的高台上朗诵了他那充满爱国主义热情的名诗“国民之歌”。
    布达佩斯不仅医治了战争的创伤，并在解放后的短短几年当中，完成了许多新的巨大的“社会主义建设工程”。为消除布达佩斯城区与郊区的差别的大工程，正在顺利进行；现在全部郊区已连成一片了。五年计划拨款一亿六千八百万佛林（匈币）为郊区敷设自来水管和下水道。在党和工会直接指导下，在许多近郊的工人集中地区，建立了大批三层至七层的舒适的宿舍——“工人之家”。
    我们曾参观过瓦赤路的工人住宅。从前，工人们称这条路为“苦难大街”，他们常常在这里集合游行、示威，反对厂主资本家的残酷剥削。那时，工人们一家四、五口只有一间小房子。但现在大多数工人的家都有三间房子，并有洗澡室、煤气供应和暖气设备。住宅四周都有丛丛花木，并摆设着精制桌椅的花园，园中有游泳池与运动场。在那长排的整齐的打开着的窗户上，像旗帜一样飘着漂亮的花边窗纱，窗台上一盆盆的鲜花连结成行，孩子们健康的苹果脸从窗子里露出来，向我们招手微笑，好像在向客人叙述着自己幸福的童年生活。
    当火车开进布达佩斯时，还在远处就可瞧见几根醒目的白色水泥高柱，匀整地耸起在一切建筑物之上。被称为“铁公牛”的大起重机的钢臂正从容地安置着三十吨重的钢骨水泥的横梁。这就是匈牙利人民引以为荣的全国体育运动中心——可容十万观众的人民体育场。在建成以后，它将是世界上规模最大、设备最完美的新式运动场之一。
    布达佩斯有许多雄伟壮丽的纪念碑，但最出色的、最为人们赞颂与敬仰的是高耸于格列尔山顶上的“自由神”——匈牙利国土和人民的解放者苏军烈士墓。每一个来到布达佩斯的革命战士，都带着无限的敬意到这墓前来吊念和献花。你看，在数丈高的青铜色的苏联近卫军战士巨像下，并排挂着两个大花圈：一个是以吉洪诺夫为首的苏联代表团献的，一个是以郭沫若为首的中国代表团献的。正中的纪念塔顶上，立着一个庄严朴素的“和平神”的铜像，她双手高捧着一片象征着和平的橄榄叶。她的左边是降服着毒蛇的无畏勇士，右边是举着火把迎接光明的新青年；墓碑的两壁，刻着建设与保卫和平生活的匈牙利劳动人民的形象，这一切都歌颂着苏军烈士的不朽功勋，和表达着匈牙利人民对拯救自己生命的恩人的永恒感激与坚决誓言。
                                    ×  ×  ×
    匈牙利人民是热忱、踏实、热爱劳动和充满活力的人民。这是到过匈牙利的人的共同感觉。无论参观工厂和农村时所见到的紧张与快乐的情形，无论在和他们一起工作及交往时所见到的高度责任心与坦白直爽，都令人深信这一点。
    给我们印象特别深的，是他们对世界各国和平使节的热烈欢迎与殷勤招待。苏联同志克鲁托夫写道：“我们的匈牙利朋友，是出色的好客的主人！”
    代表们无论出现在那里，那里的群众就出来夹道欢迎，就蜂拥过去握手、招呼、问候。学校的合唱组、工厂的管乐队、农村的舞蹈团，都忙着为客人们表演他们最优美动人的节目。劳动人民把自己从果园里刚摘下来的新鲜水果来款待客人，把准备已久的高贵礼物“和平包”、“和平箱”及“和平篮”献给客人，里面装满各色各样的礼品：精制的绣花桌布、餐巾、手帕及许多亲切感人的信，甚至还有自己的相片与最好的农作物选种。
    在依万达尔特村全村居民签名给郭沫若的信里热情地写道：“到我们村子里来作客吧，郭沫若同志！我们摆设好了浓葡萄酒和丰收的大红洋梅等候您哩，我们练习好了乐队和歌舞队将到村外去迎接您哩……。”布达佩斯“四月四日机器工厂”红星装配组组长巴洛塔里士·约瑟夫也在给郭沫若的信里说：“我们热烈欢迎伟大中国人民的和平代表来到我们祖国的首都，我们感激您带来了中国人民的敬意，我们以骄傲和荣誉的心情告诉您：我们小组以最好的质量提前一个星期完成任务，制成了一批新式的压气机运往中国……。”使人永远难忘的是六月十九日那一天，在以匈牙利伟大的民族英雄科索特命名的广场上，举行了十几万群众参加的庆祝大会的情形。当中国代表团走进会场时，群众热烈鼓掌欢呼“中国！和平！”；而当中国代表在会上以中国人民的名义向匈牙利劳动人民及其领袖致敬时，全场一片彩色树林似的旗帜就高举?动起来，全场响起了海啸似的欢呼声：“毛泽东！—毛泽东！”
    匈牙利人民把世界和平理事会开会期间的日子称为他们的“和平节”。在这些充满友谊和欢乐的日子里，美丽的布达佩斯是显得更加美丽了。全城飘扬着三色的匈牙利国旗、鲜红的苏联国旗和蓝色的和平旗，街道和广场上高悬着各种保卫和平或向和平战士致敬的标语，商店和俱乐部的玻璃窗里都挂着或摆着世界著名的和平战士的照片：居里、法捷耶夫、宋庆龄、郭沫若、南尼、大山郁夫和克其鲁等。无论你走到那里，都可以看到或听到一个响亮的字——“柏格（和平）”，这正表示着匈牙利人民是热爱和平的。正像每个匈牙利人都熟悉的那句话所说的一样：“为了伟大的和平事业，无论什么地方需要从事斗争和牺牲，匈牙利人民就一定到那里去。”
    在这六月的青色的夜晚，从马尔基特岛向两岸望去，布达佩斯更像一颗亮晶晶的珍珠！那数不尽的象征着劳动胜利的红星，有如满天的星星一样在屋顶上放着光辉。美丽的多瑙河上的小汽艇，载着欢乐的纵情歌唱的人们从宽阔的河面上飞过去。歌声愈唱愈起劲，曲调愈听愈动人：
    我的和平的祖国——匈牙利呀，
    我的生命的母亲——匈牙利呀。
    我们把青春和希望交给你！
    我们用劳动和斗争保卫你！……
