    Work in Existing Industrial and Mining Enterprises Must Be Strengthened

    In the first half of 1953, the production of China's state-owned factories and mines increased significantly compared with the same period in 1952. However, the completion of production tasks was not satisfactory according to the state plan. This situation cannot but attract our great attention.

    What exactly is the situation? According to statistics from five industrial ministries, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the Ministry of Textile Industry completed their total output value plans for the first half of the year. The Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Ministry of Light Industry did not complete their total output value plans for the first half of the year. Among the twenty major industrial products, ten completed their plans, and ten did not. Many state-owned production factories and mines still have serious problems in the execution of the state plan, such as uneven production with output being loose at the beginning and tight at the end, and fluctuations in output. Some factories and mines only completed 10% of their plan in January, 360% in March, then dropped to 14% in April, and reached 249% in June. Many factories and mines, although completing their total output value and output plans, failed to complete plans in other aspects. Some failed to complete the plan for variety, or completed the plan for secondary products but not for major products. Some failed to complete the plan for quality, with defective and substandard products still accounting for a large proportion, even increasing monthly. Some failed to complete the plans for cost and finance, with the phenomena of high product costs and slow capital turnover remaining unresolved. Failure to complete the plans for labor and raw material consumption quotas is also common.

    So, what are the reasons why our many enterprises have not completed their production tasks well?

    There are various specific reasons in different enterprises. However, the situation in the first half of the year proves that one reason is common and fundamental. This is that some industrial departments and their subordinate management organs have relaxed their leadership over production. Some departments do not have a leading cadre specifically in charge of production, and huge production tasks are the responsibility of cadres who are not up to the job. Some departments lack unified arrangements for the production work of factories and mines, do not study how to systematically improve the production management level of various factories and mines, but only manage production work in a piecemeal and bureaucratic manner. Still other departments lack regular inspection of the work of existing factories and mines, fail to resolve or fail to resolve in a timely manner the problems and difficulties existing in production. This slackness in leadership directly affects the failure to complete production tasks well in existing factories and mines.

    Relaxing leadership over production also has ideological reasons.

    Some comrades believe that since large-scale national construction has begun, to develop industry, we should build new and large factories and mines. They complain about the dilapidated old equipment and yearn for large factories and new equipment. They feel that there is nothing to be gained from some of the existing factories and mines, and there is no need to spend a lot of effort to manage them.

    Some comrades also believe that since capital construction must be given top priority, leadership over production must necessarily be relaxed. They completely separate and oppose production and capital construction, believing that it is enough to do a good job in capital construction, and that production work is no longer important. Some comrades, even in areas under their leadership where there are no major capital construction tasks and where production is still the most important task, routinely shout that capital construction should be given top priority, but pay little attention to important production work.

    Some comrades also believe that our existing enterprises have undergone various democratic reforms and have accumulated considerable experience in production management, so even if we relax a little, there will be no major problems. Some even believe that in production factories and mines, things will be produced even if no one is in charge.

    In addition, some comrades believe that "cadres have been drawn away from production factories and mines, making it difficult to work," and therefore lack confidence in completing tasks and lack the courage to overcome various difficulties.

    Obviously, these thoughts and emotions are incorrect and unhealthy.

    Some of our comrades do not yet understand that strengthening leadership over industrial capital construction should never mean relaxing leadership over industrial production. At the beginning of the country's planned construction, it is entirely correct and necessary to give capital construction top priority and to concentrate leadership appropriately in capital construction. With the increasing tasks of industrial capital construction, it will be necessary to continue to strengthen the leadership of the Party and the government over industrial capital construction in the future. However, to complete the tasks of national industrial capital construction, we must never abandon the foundation of existing industry. If we abandon this foundation and neglect existing industrial and mining enterprises, we will only be building industry in the air.

    Why do we say that existing industrial and mining enterprises are the foundation for developing China's industry? What tasks do they undertake in the national construction effort?

    First, existing industrial and mining enterprises undertake the task of expanding reproduction and strengthening national defense in our country. In order to expand reproduction and establish a strong national defense force, it is necessary to produce enough steel, electricity, fuel, non-ferrous metals, various machines, and building materials such as wood and cement to meet the needs of industrial development and national defense. Newly built or expanded industries cannot enter production in a short period of time, or cannot all enter production, so the above-mentioned means of production must rely on existing heavy industry to produce and continuously improve the productivity of existing industrial and mining enterprises to meet these needs. In particular, a large amount of equipment for China's newly built enterprises, whether heavy industry or light industry, in addition to Soviet aid, still needs to be manufactured and supplied by China's existing machinery factories, so the task of the machinery industry is particularly important and arduous. In addition, existing industries also undertake the task of supplying farmers with fertilizers and agricultural machinery.

    Second, existing industrial and mining enterprises undertake the task of supplying people with daily necessities. Everyone knows that the purchasing power of the people—especially the large number of farmers—will continue to increase under the conditions of production development, and they need a large number of high-quality, low-priced daily necessities. These must rely on existing light industry to produce and continuously improve the productivity of existing enterprises to meet these needs. If we cannot meet the needs of the people, especially the farmers, in this regard, it will not only affect the development of industry and agriculture but will also greatly damage the ties between the Party and the government and the people, especially affecting the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.

    Third, existing industrial and mining enterprises undertake the task of preparing technical forces for newly built and expanded enterprises. Everyone knows that newly built and expanded enterprises in our country need a huge number of technical and management cadres. Relying solely on schools to train such a large number of cadres cannot meet the requirements, so a large part of the task of training cadres has to be undertaken by existing industrial and mining enterprises. The fact is that existing industrial and mining enterprises are good places for many people to learn business and technology, to change from laymen to experts, and even to become specialists. Existing industrial and mining enterprises must not only train technical and management cadres but also train a larger number of skilled workers.

    Finally, existing industrial and mining enterprises undertake the task of accumulating funds for the state. Everyone knows that our country's large-scale construction requires huge amounts of funds. An important source of funds is the accumulation of existing enterprises. Increasing production and practicing strict economy in existing enterprises is one of the important conditions for directly guaranteeing the successful completion of the country's industrial construction.

    From this, it can be seen that China's existing industrial and mining enterprises undertake extremely important and arduous tasks. These tasks can be summarized as "providing money, people, and machines." Completing these tasks is actually a powerful support for the country's industrial capital construction. Without relying on existing enterprises and giving full play to the potential of existing enterprises, the realization of national industrialization will become empty talk. Therefore, all ideas that underestimate existing enterprises or view capital construction as opposed to production are without any basis and are therefore extremely wrong. As for the idea that the management work of production factories and mines has been done almost enough, or the fear of difficulties, it is also incorrect.

    After recognizing the importance of existing enterprises ideologically, the important issue is to specifically strengthen leadership over existing enterprises. Based on the situation in the first half of this year, the following issues must be resolved:

    First, the situation in which certain ministries and bureaus have no leading cadres responsible for production work must be changed. Each industrial department should immediately designate a person specifically responsible for leading production work among the ministers and bureau chiefs to establish a responsibility system for the leadership of production by the ministries and bureaus. Departments with few capital construction tasks should have the leading cadres of the ministry and bureau focus their main efforts on production work, and establish and strengthen the institutions of the industrial ministry (bureau) for managing production and technology.

    Second, research on production work must be strengthened. In the second half of this year, we should focus on studying how to implement planned management and promote operational plans in enterprises. According to the characteristics of the production tasks of each enterprise and the different working bases, different methods should be stipulated, and the work of implementing planned management and promoting operational plans in various types of enterprises should be specifically arranged in a step-by-step and focused manner.

    Third, conduct regular inspections and supervision of enterprise production work, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, change general leadership, and conduct specific and in-depth leadership. Leading cadres of the ministry and bureau must personally grasp several factories and mines with typical significance, specifically guide the enterprise leaders, analyze the situation, raise questions, summarize experience, guide the progress of central work, and thereby obtain experiences with universal significance to guide the work of other factories and mines. When selecting typical factories and mines, the leading departments should not only find advanced factories and mines with a foundation to create and absorb experience, but also select some factories and mines that are backward in production and have no foundation in work, so as to specifically guide them to overcome backwardness, become advanced, and find experience to solve the problems of other backward factories and mines.

    Fourth, in view of the fact that the main leaders of many industrial production factories and mines relaxed their specific leadership over enterprise production work in the first half of this year, the factory director or enterprise manager must personally grasp the leadership of enterprise production work. When the enterprise itself has a large capital construction task that requires the factory director or manager to be personally responsible, a strongest deputy factory director or deputy manager should be designated to be responsible for leading production work. In industrial and mining enterprises, functional institutions should be improved, and production scheduling institutions should be established and strengthened to make them powerful assistants to the factory and mine leaders in leading production work.

### 现有工矿企业工作必须加强

    现有工矿企业工作必须加强
    一九五三年上半年，我国国营厂矿的生产，和一九五二年同期比较，有了很大的增长；但是，如果按照国家的计划来检查，生产任务完成的情况却并不好。这种情况不能不引起我们的极大注意。
    情况究竟是怎么样呢？据五个工业部统计，重工业部、第一机械工业部、纺织工业部完成了上半年总产值计划，燃料工业部和轻工业部没有完成上半年总产值计划；在二十种主要工业产品中，完成计划的有十种，没有完成计划的也有十种。许多国营生产厂矿在执行国家计划的过程中，生产前松后紧，产量忽高忽低等不均衡现象仍然很严重。甚至有的厂矿一月份只完成计划百分之十，三月份完成了百分之三百六十，四月份又降为百分之十四，六月份则为百分之二百四十九。还有不少厂矿，总产值和产量虽然完成了计划，但其他方面没有完成计划。其中有的是品种没有完成计划，或者次要产品完成了计划，主要产品却没有完成计划；有的是质量没有完成计划，废品和次品仍然占很大比例，甚至逐月有所增加；有的是成本、财务没有完成计划，产品成本高、资金周转慢的现象仍未克服；在劳动、原材料消耗等定额方面没有完成计划的也很普遍。
    那末，是什么原因使我们的这许多企业的生产任务完成得不好呢？
    在不同的企业中有各种不同的具体原因。但上半年的情况证明，其中有一个原因却是共同的和基本的。这就是某些工业部门及其所属的管理机关放松了对生产的领导。有些部门没有一个领导干部专管生产，巨大的生产任务是由一些力不胜任的干部去负责的；有些部门对厂矿的生产工作缺乏统一的布置，不研究如何有步骤地去提高各个厂矿的生产管理水平，而只是零星地和事务主义地去管理生产工作；也有一些部门，对现有厂矿的工作缺乏经常的检查，不解决生产中存在的问题和某些困难，或解决得不及时。这种领导上的松弛现象，就直接影响到现有厂矿的生产任务不能很好地完成。
    放松对生产的领导，还有着思想上的原因的。
    有这样一些同志，他们认为国家大规模建设既已开始，要搞工业，就要搞新的和大的厂矿；他们埋怨旧设备破破烂烂，一心向往于大工厂和新设备。他们觉得现有的一些厂矿没有什么搞头，也用不着花费很大力气去经营。
    也有一些同志，认为既要把基本建设放在首要地位，就必然要放松对生产的领导。他们把生产和基本建设完全割裂开来和对立起来，认为办好基本建设就行，至于生产工作，现在已不关重要。甚至有的同志在他们所领导的范围内，并没有重大的基本建设任务，生产仍是最主要的任务，但却照例地在喊着要把基本建设放到首要地位，对于重要的生产工作却不大过问。
    还有一些同志，认为我们现有的企业已经进行了各种民主改革，生产管理也已经有了不少经验，即使放松一点，也不会出什么大问题。甚至有人认为在生产厂矿里，不用管也可以生产出东西来。
    另外有一些同志，认为生产厂矿中“干部抽光，工作难做”，因此缺乏信心去完成任务，缺乏勇气去战胜各种困难。
    显然，这些思想和情绪是不正确和不健康的。
    我们有些同志还不了解，加强对工业基本建设的领导，绝不应该放松对工业生产的领导。在国家有计划建设开始的时候，把基本建设放到首要地位，把领导力量适当集中在基本建设方面，这是完全正确的和必要的。随着工业基本建设任务的日益增加，今后还必须继续不断加强党和政府对工业基本建设的领导。但是，要完成国家工业基本建设的任务，我们就绝不能离开现有工业的基础。如果离开了这个基础，忽视了现有的工矿企业，那我们只有从空中去建设工业了。
    为什么说现有工矿企业是发展我国工业的基础？它在国家建设事业中担负着什么样的任务呢？
    首先，现有的工矿企业担负着我国工业扩大再生产和加强国防的任务。为了扩大再生产和建立强大的国防力量，必须生产足够的、与工业发展需要及国防需要相适应的钢铁、电力、燃料、有色金属、各种机器以及木材、水泥等建筑材料。而新建或扩建的工业在一个短时期内是不可能进入生产，或不能全部进入生产的，因此上述那些生产资料，必须依靠现有重工业来生产，和不断提高现有工矿企业的生产力来满足。特别是我国新建的企业，不论是重工业或者是轻工业，它的大量的设备，除苏联的援助外，很大一部分还需要我国现有机械工厂来制造和供应，因此机械工业的任务就特别显得重要和艰巨。此外，现有的工业还担负着供应农民以肥料和农业机器的任务。
    其次，现有工矿企业担负着供应人民生活必需品的任务。谁都知道，人民——其中特别是为数众多的农民，在生产发展的条件下，购买力将不断提高，他们需要大量物美价廉的生活必需品。而这一些，必须依靠现有轻工业来生产，和不断提高现有企业的生产力来满足。如果在这一方面不能满足人民特别是农民的需要，不仅影响到工业和农业的发展，而且将极大地损害党和政府与人民的联系，特别影响到工农联盟的巩固。
    再次，现有的工矿企业担负着为新建和扩建的企业准备技术力量的任务。谁都知道，我国新建和扩建的企业，需要极大数量的技术干部和管理干部。这样大量的干部，仅仅依靠学校培养是不能满足要求的，因此很大一部分培养干部的任务，就不得不由现有的工矿企业来担负。事实也正是这样，现有的工矿企业，是使许多人学习业务和技术，从外行变为内行，以至成为专门家的良好场所。现有的工矿企业不仅要培养技术干部和管理干部，而且必须培养更大数量的技术工人。
    最后，现有的工矿企业还担负着为国家积累资金的任务。谁都知道，我国规模巨大的建设，需要巨量的资金。而资金的来源，重要的一个部分是现有企业的积累。在现有企业中增加生产，厉行节约，是直接保证国家工业建设胜利完成的重要条件之一。
    由此可见，我国现有工矿企业担负着极为重要和艰巨的任务。这些任务集中起来说，就是“出钱、出人、出机器”。完成这些任务，实际上就是有力地支援了国家的工业基本建设。如果不依靠现有企业，不发挥现有企业的潜在力量，实现国家工业化就会变成一句空话。因此，一切轻视现有企业的思想，或把基本建设与生产对立的看法，都是没有丝毫根据的，因而也是极其错误的。至于认为生产厂矿的管理工作已经做得差不多了的想法，或者害怕困难的情绪，也是不对的。
    在思想上认识了现有企业的重要性以后，重要的问题就在于具体加强对现有企业的领导。根据今年上半年的情况，必须解决以下问题：
    第一，某些部、局无领导干部负责生产工作的状况必须改变。各工业部门应立即在部长、局长中指定专人负责生产工作的领导，以建立部、局领导生产的责任制。某些基本建设任务不多的部门，部和局的领导干部应将主要力量放在生产工作方面，并建立与加强工业部（局）管理生产、技术的机构。
    第二，必须加强对生产工作的研究。今年下半年应着重研究企业中怎样实行计划管理和推行作业计划。按照各个企业生产任务的特点及工作基础的不同，应规定不同的办法，有步骤有重点地具体布置各类企业实行计划管理、推行作业计划的工作。
    第三，对企业生产工作进行经常的检查和督促，及时发现问题和解决问题，改变一般化的领导，进行具体、深入的领导。部和局的领导干部必须亲自掌握若干有典型意义的厂矿，具体指导企业的领导人员，分析情况，提出问题，总结经验，指导中心工作的进行，并由此取得有普遍意义的经验，以指导其他厂矿的工作。领导部门在选择典型厂矿时，不仅要找先进的有基础的厂矿去创造并吸取经验，而且要选择某些生产落后和工作没有基础的厂矿，以便具体指导他们克服落后状态，变为先进，找到经验去解决其他落后厂矿的问题。
    第四，鉴于今年上半年不少工业生产厂矿的主要领导人员放松了对企业生产工作的具体领导，因此，厂长或企业的经理必须亲自掌握企业生产工作的领导；在企业本身的基本建设任务较大，需要厂长或经理亲自负责时，就应指定一个最强的副厂长或副经理负责领导生产工作。在工矿企业中要健全职能机构，建立和加强生产调度机构，使它们成为厂矿负责人领导生产工作的有力助手。
