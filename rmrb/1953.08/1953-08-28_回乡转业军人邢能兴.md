Demobilized Soldier Xing Nengxing Returns Home
Chen Qianmei

Xing Nengxing, a demobilized soldier from Nanguan Village, Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, has actively responded to the call of his superiors upon his demobilization in May 1952, actively participating in production and striving to be a model on the production front.

Soon after returning home, he held a forum with two disabled revolutionary soldiers and eight other demobilized soldiers from the village. At the meeting, everyone introduced their personal production and living situations, recalled the instructions of their superiors, and discussed future production plans. Through this forum, Xing Nengxing learned that among these ten people, some were enjoying mass cultivation due to their disabilities, some had difficulties in production due to their physical weakness, and some had some difficulties in their lives. Xing Nengxing thought to himself: If these problems are not resolved as soon as possible, it will affect production, and living standards will not be improved. Therefore, after the meeting, he first automatically lent fifty jin of millet to demobilized soldier Qi Deyi to help him solve his immediate difficulties. At the same time, he also organized everyone to help Qi Deyi weed eight mu of sorghum and millet. Under Xing Nengxing's active promotion, they often worked collectively and helped each other, which improved everyone's production enthusiasm and left them with surplus labor. So Xing Nengxing discussed with everyone and contracted the earthwork and carpentry portion of the Dingxiang County Middle School construction project. After a month of labor, the eleven of them earned 4.8 million yuan in wages. On this basis, they officially established a mutual aid team.

The team had a total of fifty-one mu of land. Since the establishment of the mutual aid team, everyone felt that the land was too small and not enough for cultivation. At this time, Xing Nengxing led everyone to reclaim 75 mu of river滩地 in their spare time, expanding the cultivated area, and everyone's production enthusiasm was further increased. In addition to their own team's production, they also took time to do short-term work for the masses. By the end of last year, the entire team, including sideline production, had a total income of 18,876,000 yuan, which not only overcame the difficulties of insufficient manpower and animal power in production, but also initially improved living standards and established public property. In addition to spending a portion of the income based on each person's situation for resettlement expenses, the remaining income was used as the team's public property, and they bought two horses, two donkeys, a cart, and a walking plow. As a result, those who had previously enjoyed substitute cultivation no longer needed the masses to cultivate for them, reducing the burden on the masses and receiving praise from the local people.

Xing Nengxing not only paid attention to leading the team's production, but also actively participated in various social activities. The mutual aid team he led played a leading and backbone role in responding to the government's calls and various movements. For example, in preferential treatment work, after returning home, Xing Nengxing suggested that the government hang honorary plaques for military families, and he and others divided up the work to visit and comfort the families of martyrs and military personnel, publicizing the victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to the families of martyrs and military personnel, and encouraging everyone to actively engage in production. During the New Year and festivals, their mutual aid team also gave gifts to the families of martyrs and military personnel. In addition, their mutual aid team also provided free water carrying for military families without labor all year round, and also provided many assistance and care to the families of martyrs and military personnel during the busy farming season, which was supported by the local people. Now, six people in Xing Nengxing's mutual aid team serve as village civil affairs committee members or cultural and educational committee members.

In leading production, Xing Nengxing also often humbly learns from the masses, exchanges production experience, so that team members can continuously improve their mastery of production technology. At the same time, he also often discusses with comrades from relevant departments of the People's Government how to consolidate the mutual aid team and solve the problems within the team, so that the mutual aid team can develop steadily and healthily. In addition to a fair and reasonable scoring and work point system, the team has also established a regular learning system and meeting system, giving play to internal democracy, so that everyone can always maintain high production enthusiasm, laying the foundation for future production.

Due to Xing Nengxing's active leadership in organizing the revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized soldiers in the village to participate in production, reducing the burden on the masses, and caring for the lives of the masses, he has been loved by the masses. Last year, he was elected as a county model of preferential treatment, a representative of the people from all walks of life in the county, and a member of the Standing Committee of the County People's Congress, and also served as a village civil affairs committee member. Xing Nengxing is not complacent because of this. He realizes that only more active production can maintain and strive for greater honor.

    回乡转业军人邢能兴
    陈乾美
    山西省定襄县南关村转业军人邢能兴，自从一九五二年五月从部队转业回家以后，就积极响应部队首长在临别时的号召，积极参加生产，争取在生产战线上当模范。
    回家不久，他就和村里的两个革命残废军人和八个回乡转业军人开了一个座谈会，大家在会上介绍了个人的生产和生活情况，回忆了部队首长的指示，研究了今后的生产计划。经过这次座谈，邢能兴了解了这十个人当中，有的因身体残废享受着群众代耕，有的因身体弱在生产上有困难，有的生活上也有些困难。邢能兴心想：这些问题如不能及早解决，就会影响生产，生活也不能提高。因此在会后，他便首先自动地借给回乡转业军人齐德义小米五十斤，帮助他解决眼前的困难。同时又组织大家帮助齐德义锄了八亩高粱和谷子。在邢能兴的积极推动下，他们经常集体干活，互相帮助，提高了大家的生产积极性，劳动力也有了剩余。于是邢能兴又和大家商量，包揽了定襄县立中学建校工程中的土木部分。他们十一个人经过了一个月的劳动，挣了四百八十万元工资。他们就在这个基础上正式成立了互助组。
    组内一共有五十一亩地。自成立了互助组以后，大家就感到土地少不够耕种。这时邢能兴又领导大家抽空开垦了河滩地七十五亩，扩大了耕地面积，大家的生产情绪也更加提高了。他们除了自己组内的生产外，还抽出时间给群众做短工。截至去年年底，全组连同副业生产，一共收入了一千八百八十七万六千元，不仅克服了生产中人力畜力不足的困难，而且还初步提高了生活，建立了公共财产。他们除根据每人情况支出一部分作安家费用外，其余收入都作为组内公共财产，一共买了两匹马、两头驴、一辆大车和一张步犁。这样一来，过去享受代耕的也不再需要群众代耕了，减轻了群众的负担，受到当地群众的赞扬。
    邢能兴不仅注意领导组内生产，同时还积极参加各种社会活动。他领导的互助组在响应政府的号召和各种运动中，都能起带头作用和骨干作用。如优抚工作，邢能兴回家后，就建议政府给军属挂了光荣匾，并和其他人分工包干，挨门逐户地慰问烈属军属，向烈属军属宣传抗美援朝的胜利消息，鼓舞大家积极生产。过年过节，他们互助组还给烈属军属送礼。此外，他们互助组还常年给无劳动力军属义务担水，在农忙时节，也给烈属军属许多帮助和照顾，受到当地群众的拥护。现在邢能兴互助组内有六个人担任村民政委员或文教委员等职务。
    邢能兴在领导生产中，还经常虚心地向群众学习，交换生产经验，使组员们在掌握生产技术上能不断地得到进步和提高。同时，他还经常和人民政府有关部门的同志研究怎样巩固互助组和解决组内问题的办法，使互助组稳步健康地发展。组内除有公平合理的评分计工制度外，还建立了定期的学习制度和会议制度，发挥了组内民主，使大家经常保持很高的生产热情，给今后生产奠定了基础。
    由于邢能兴的积极带头，组织在乡的革命残废军人和回乡转业军人参加生产，减轻群众负担，关心群众生活，因此得到了群众的敬爱；去年被选为县优抚模范、县各界人民代表会议的代表和县人民代表会议常务委员会委员，并担任了村民政委员。邢能兴并不因此而自满。他认识到了只有更加积极的生产，才能保持和争取更大的荣誉。
