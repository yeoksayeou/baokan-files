Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th – Except for the first and second joint observation teams responsible for the Han River estuary area, which are still awaiting departure orders, the remaining eight teams of the Military Armistice Commission have begun the task of supervising the implementation of the provisions of the armistice agreement regarding the demilitarized zone.

From August 1st to 5th, after the members of the Korean-Chinese side of each joint observation team met with the U.S. side members in their respective sectors for the first time, they inspected our side's withdrawal from the demilitarized zone according to the agreed-upon work procedures, and notified the U.S. side that our troops had completed the withdrawal from the demilitarized zone in a timely manner, as per the agreement. Under the supervision of the Korean-Chinese side members, our side dispatched unarmed personnel to actively clear various hazards within our demilitarized zone. Currently, safe passages for the joint observation teams to pass through have been cleared, and further thorough clearing work is underway.

Regarding the establishment of boundary markers for the military demarcation line, according to the agreement between both sides: each sector for which a joint observation team is responsible will be divided into sections A and B from west to east, with the U.S. side and our side responsible for the establishment of these markers respectively. Currently, within the sectors for which our side is responsible in each team, various preparatory tasks have been completed in accordance with the agreement. We are now waiting for each joint observation team to reach an agreement on the specific arrangements for establishing the boundary markers for the military demarcation line, after which the work can commence.
