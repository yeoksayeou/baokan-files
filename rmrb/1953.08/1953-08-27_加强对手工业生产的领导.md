    Strengthen Leadership over Handicraft Production

    The "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on June 13 published letters from readers reflecting the lack of attention to handicraft production in some areas. The replies from the relevant units are summarized below.

    Regarding the problem of the Shashi Purchasing and Supplying Station of Hubei Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company (the original letter mistakenly referred to it as Shashi Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company) treating the hand-weaving industry incorrectly, the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has replied. The letter states: "After inspection by the Hubei Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company: the Shashi Purchasing and Supplying Station began organizing handicraft households for processing work in February 1951. At that time, in order to adjust the supply of cotton cloth, processing was blindly expanded; at the end of 1951, there were more than 400 looms in the local area, which developed to more than 700 looms by the end of 1952. However, the station did not provide good guidance and supervision for the organization of processing work, resulting in high prices and poor quality of processed products. Although the listed prices were lower than the cost, there was still a large backlog, and state property suffered great losses. As for forcing the original hand-weaving households to participate in processing work, it was of course extremely wrong. This spring, under the leadership of the Municipal Finance and Economic Commission, the station began to tighten the scope of processing, mobilizing handicraft households with funds to produce and sell themselves, and providing loans to households with difficulties through the bank; the issue of worker unemployment was also personally controlled by the mayor, mobilizing young people who had flowed into the city from the countryside to return to their hometowns for production. The tightening of processing looms was indeed done somewhat hastily. After several months of work and publicity and explanation, and helping self-employed households find outlets for their products, the opinions of some handicraft households have been basically eliminated. As for the station's raising of cotton yarn listed prices mentioned in the letter, it is understood that this is not the case."

    The People's Government of Mingshui County, Heilongjiang Province, sent a letter reporting on the county's inspection of the leadership's work on handicraft production. The letter states: "After seeing the letter from reader Wang Zhenhua published in the newspaper, the County Finance and Economic Commission and the Industry and Commerce Section inspected the leadership's work on handicraft production, held a symposium with handicraft households to understand the current problems, and convened relevant units such as the County Cooperative, the People's Bank, and the Native Products Company to study solutions. In recent years, we have provided some assistance to handicraft production needed by the people, and have provided some loans or assistance in purchasing raw materials for blacksmiths, carpenters' shops, brick kilns, papermakers, and fur processing handicraft households, but it has not been done enough. Some departments do not have a sufficient understanding of the significant role of handicraft production in the people's production and life, and therefore have not earnestly implemented the policy of supporting handicrafts beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. For example, the County Cooperative cannot meet the requirements of the carpentry handicraft households when supplying timber, and some practices of the Iron Industry Production Cooperative have played a role in squeezing out private blacksmiths' shops. The county's leading organs have not grasped the situation of handicraft production well, and therefore cannot promptly solve the problems existing in handicraft production. The above situation is detrimental to the development of handicraft production. According to our understanding, the biggest problem currently felt by handicraft households in our county is insufficient funds, followed by difficulties in purchasing raw materials. We plan to provide appropriate loans based on the specific situation, and try to supply or organize them to purchase raw materials from other places. We have decided that in the future, a dedicated person will be responsible for leading the work of handicraft production, in order to deeply grasp the situation, provide planned support for handicrafts, and help solve the difficulties in production. Some of the situations in reader Wang Zhenhua's letter of criticism differ from the facts. However, this is still helpful in urging us to improve our work."

    In addition, regarding the issue of the Zhumadian Town Committee of the Communist Party of China blindly developing handicraft production groups, resulting in the collapse of most of them, the Zhumadian Town Committee of the Communist Party of China has not yet replied. We hope that they will quickly investigate this issue and inform us of the results as soon as possible.

### 加强对手工业生产的领导

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    加强对手工业生产的领导
    六月十三日“读者来信摘要”栏刊登了读者反映某些地区不重视手工业生产情况的来信。现将各有关单位的答复摘要发表于后。
    关于湖北省花纱布公司沙市采购供应站（原批评信误为沙市花纱布公司）错误地对待手工织布业的问题，中国花纱布公司已来信作了答复。来信说：“这个问题经湖北省花纱布公司检查：沙市采购供应站在一九五一年二月开始进行组织手工业户加工的工作。当时为了调剂棉布供应，曾盲目扩大加工；一九五一年底当地有布机四百余台，到一九五二年底就发展到七百多台。而该站对组织加工工作又没有很好指导监督，以致加工产品价高质次，虽然牌价低于成本，仍有大量积压，国家财产受到很大损失。至于强制原有手工织布户一律参加加工的情况，当然是极端错误的。今年春季，该站在市财政经济委员会领导下着手紧缩加工范围，动员有资金的手工织布户自产自销，有困难户则由银行贷款；对工人失业问题也由市长亲自掌握，动员那些由农村流入城市的青年还乡生产。关于紧缩加工机台问题，确实做得有些过急。经过几个月的工作和宣传解释，并帮助自营户寻觅产品出路，某些手工业户的意见已基本消除。至于来信中所述该站提高棉纱牌价问题，据了解并无此事实。”
    黑龙江省明水县人民政府来信报告了该县检查领导手工业生产工作的情况。来信说：“看到报上发表的读者王振华的来信后，县财政经济委员会和工商科检查了领导手工业生产的工作，召开了手工业户座谈会了解目前所存在的问题，并召集县合作社、人民银行、土产公司等有关单位开会研究解决办法。几年来，我们对为人民所需要的手工业生产作了一些扶助，对铁匠炉、木匠铺、砖窑、纸匠、毛皮加工等手工业户曾做过一些贷款或协助购买原料的工作，但做得很不够。某些部门对手工业生产对人民生产和生活上的重大作用认识不足，因此没有认真贯彻扶植有益于国计民生的手工业的政策。如县合作社供应木材时不能满足木业手工户的要求，铁业生产合作社的某些做法起了排挤私人铁匠炉的作用。县领导机关对手工业生产的情况没有很好掌握，因此就不能及时解决手工业生产中存在的问题。以上情况是对手工业生产的发展不利的。经我们了解，目前我县手工业户感到的最大问题是资金不足，其次是在购买原料时有困难。我们准备根据具体情况适当给以贷款，并设法供应或组织他们到外地采购原料。我们决定今后由专人负责领导手工业生产的工作，以便深入掌握情况，有计划地对手工业进行扶植，并帮助解决生产中的困难。读者王振华批评信中有某些情况与事实是有出入的。但，这对督促我们改进工作还是有帮助的。”
    此外，关于中共河南驻马店镇委员会盲目发展手工业生产组、结果大部垮台的问题，中共驻马店镇委员会至今还没来信答复，希望他们迅速检查这个问题及早把结果告诉我们。
