    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 17th: People's governments at all levels in the Southwest region have implemented the resolutions of the Southwest Region Ethnic Minority Areas Economic Work Conference last year, and have made achievements in helping ethnic minority people develop production and carry out trade.
    This year, people's governments at all levels in the Southwest first strengthened their leadership over agricultural production in ethnic minority areas. Yunnan Province established the "Mountainous Area Agricultural Production Improvement Committee" to lead the work of improving production in more than 3,000 ethnic minority communities and mixed residential villages. The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province organized production work teams to go to various counties in the autonomous region to assist in production. The Guizhou Provincial People's Government also sent work teams to ethnic minority areas in Bijie, Duyun, Xingyi, and Zhenyuan to lead production. All localities are focusing on solving the problem of means of production as the main task for developing agricultural production. The local people's governments have distributed large quantities of farm tools. The funds for ordering farm tools in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province and the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region reached 13.8 billion yuan. Guizhou Province has distributed more than 255,000 pieces of free farm tools in 72 counties. The farm tools distributed in various places are all custom-made according to the styles favored by ethnic minorities. A batch of farm tools recently ordered by the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province in Chongqing includes various styles such as Ganzi style and Dengke style. At the same time, the people's government also supports the handicraft industry for manufacturing farm tools, supplies raw materials, and organizes blacksmiths to repair or manufacture farm tools for ethnic minority farmers. Local people's governments have also issued large amounts of agricultural loans to help ethnic minorities build water conservancy projects and purchase fertilizers. The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province has issued more than 3.9 billion yuan of various agricultural loans. According to incomplete statistics from Maoxian, Lixian, and Wenchuan counties alone, ethnic minority farmers have used loans to purchase more than 6,000 pieces of farm tools and 198 head of cattle and mules.
    People's governments in various places also regard helping ethnic minority farmers gradually change their primitive farming methods as another major task for developing agricultural production. This year, state-owned farms and agricultural technology guidance stations in ethnic minority areas in the Southwest have paid attention to improving technology in production and played a good demonstration and guidance role. Now, the farming technology in ethnic minority areas in the Southwest has been improved; various crops are growing well, and early rice and corn have been harvested in some areas, and yields have been increased.
    People's governments at all levels in the Southwest also implemented the resolution to carry out trade in ethnic minority areas. The financial and economic departments in various places have begun to attach importance to investigation and research work, organize work teams, go deep into ethnic minority areas to conduct investigation and research, so that trade organizations can supply production and living materials in a timely manner, and purchase local and special products according to the actual situation. This year, due to the good sales of local and special products, not only has the lives of people of all ethnic groups been further improved, but also helped develop cash crops and sideline production.

    西南区各级人民政府
    帮助少数民族发展生产和开展贸易有成绩
    【新华社重庆十七日电】西南区各级人民政府贯彻执行去年西南区少数民族地区经济工作会议的决议，帮助少数民族人民发展生产，开展贸易工作，已有了成绩。
    西南各级人民政府今年首先加强了对少数民族地区农业生产的领导。云南省成立了“改进山区农业生产委员会”，领导三千多个少数民族聚居和杂居乡改进生产工作。西康省藏族自治区组织了生产工作组到自治区各县协助生产。贵州省人民政府也派出工作组到毕节、都匀、兴义、镇远等专区少数民族聚居地区领导生产。各地都以解决生产资料为发展农业生产的主要工作。各地人民政府分别发放了大批农具。西康省藏族自治区和凉山彝族自治区订购农具的款项，即达一百三十八亿元。贵州省已在七十二个县内发放了无偿农具二十五万五千多件。各地发放的农具，都是按照少数民族喜欢的式样订制的。西康省藏族自治区最近在重庆订制的一批农具，就有甘孜式、邓柯式等各种式样。同时人民政府还扶植制造农具的手工业，供给原料，并组织打铁工人为少数民族农民修补或制造农具。各地人民政府又发放大批农业贷款，帮助少数民族兴修水利，购置肥料。四川省藏族自治区发放了各种农业贷款三十九亿多万元，仅茂县、理县、汶川等三县不完全统计，少数民族农民就利用贷款购买了农具六千多件和耕牛、骡马一百九十八头。
    各地人民政府并以帮助少数民族农民逐渐改变原始耕作方法，为发展农业生产的另一主要工作。今年西南少数民族地区的国营农场和农业技术指导站，在生产中注意改进技术，起了良好的示范和指导作用。现在，西南少数民族地区的耕作技术，已有了改进；各种作物生长良好，部分地区收割了早稻、玉米，产量都得到提高。
    西南各级人民政府同时执行在少数民族地区开展贸易工作的决议。各地财经部门都已开始重视调查研究工作，组织工作组，深入少数民族地区，进行调查研究，使贸易机构根据实际情况，及时供应生产、生活资料，和收购土产、特产。今年由于土、特产品的销路较好，不仅使各族人民的生活进一步得到改善，同时还帮助发展了经济作物和副业生产。
