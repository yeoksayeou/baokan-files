    Films of People's Hungary
    Mao Dun
    The Hungarian People's Republic Film Week, held simultaneously in twenty major cities in our country, will begin on the 20th of this month. This will be of great significance in strengthening and consolidating the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people and promoting cultural and artistic exchanges between the two countries.
    Since the Hungarian people were liberated and established a people's democratic government, the cause of culture and art has made great and rapid progress. Hungarian people's cinema has achieved brilliant accomplishments in a short period of time. This achievement is inseparable from the correct leadership and deep concern of the Hungarian Working People's Party for the film industry, and the creative labor of Hungarian film workers.
    Since the nationalization of Hungarian film enterprises in the spring of 1948, that is, in the middle of the second year of Hungary's three-year plan, Hungarian film art has been advancing towards socialist realism by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and with the help of Soviet artists. The first film to gain international fame was "A Piece of Land" (awarded the Labor Prize at the 1949 International Film Festival). This film and its sister film "Liberated Land" can be said to be an epic of Hungarian peasants, showing the resistance of Hungarian peasants to the landlord class before liberation, and the enthusiasm with which Hungarian peasants, who have obtained land after liberation, are building their new lives. In "A Piece of Land," the peasants are not yet organized, but they have begun to awaken; although the protagonist's resistance to the landlord has failed, his firm resistance has sown the seeds of fire among the peasant masses, pointing out that the final victor is not the exploiting landlord, but the exploited peasant. It reflects the truth of history and uses revolutionary spirit to point out the way forward. This is the socialist realist ideological method of "A Piece of Land." In "Liberated Land," the Hungarian peasants we see are different from those in "A Piece of Land." They are an organized mass under the leadership of the working class. They are new people who have been transformed. They are people who control their own destiny and build a new society with infinite confidence.
    With the rapid progress and great achievements of Hungary's socialist construction, Hungarian films, under the guiding principle of "reflecting socialist construction in content and reflecting the characteristics of Hungarian national life in form," have achieved greater and greater success. It reflects the most important phenomena and problems in Hungarian social and political life, expresses the essence of social development, and creates vivid typical examples of new people.
    The six films screened during this Hungarian Film Week have diverse themes and ideological themes, not only showing us the various important aspects of Hungarian people's lives, but also because of their profound ideological content and the realistic significance of the issues they raise for us here, these films are of great educational significance to the vast audience in our country.
    Let us briefly introduce the content of these six films.
    "Baptism of Fire" shows the agricultural production cooperative movement in Hungary, pointing out that the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives requires uniting the middle peasants and preventing the rich peasants from sowing discord and sabotage. The film profoundly depicts the ideological problems existing among the peasants; it exposes the wavering and selfishness of the middle peasants, and also criticizes the "leftist" impatience of mistakenly identifying the middle peasants as enemies and being unwilling to patiently win them over. The theme of "Mattie the Goose-boy" also depicts peasant life, but not modern life, but a review of the Hungarian countryside in the feudal era two hundred years ago. This is adapted from a long poem by the 17th-century Hungarian poet Mihály Fazekas. The film shows the peasants' hatred for the landlords, and profoundly depicts how the goose-boy Mattie, with his courage, wit and determination, and the sympathy and support of the peasants in the village, beat the landlord who had insulted him three times. The film skillfully portrays the peasants' bravery, justice, wit, and the landlords' greed, cowardice, and stupidity.
    "Two Worlds" shows the completely different attitudes of the imperialist aggressive camp headed by US imperialism and the peaceful democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union towards science—the former makes science serve the war to destroy mankind, and the latter makes science serve peace and improve people's happiness. The story of the film is as follows: A famous Hungarian geophysicist who is studying a new type of coal detector went to East Berlin to attend a geological conference. The American intelligence agency in West Berlin instructed the American scientist it hired (who was originally an old friend of the Hungarian scientist) to set a trap, kidnapped the Hungarian scientist to West Berlin, and used all kinds of brutal and despicable means in an attempt to make this scientist, who faithfully serves the peace and happiness of the people of his country, submit to violence; and use his newly invented instrument to explore for raw materials for manufacturing atomic weapons for the warmongers. But the American secret agents completely miscalculated. Great patriotism and the lofty ideal of benefiting mankind cannot be subdued by any violence. After arduous struggles, the respectable Hungarian scientist finally escaped from the clutches of the devil. The film exposes the shamelessness, cruelty and insidiousness of US imperialism, shows the noble qualities of the Hungarian scientist's steadfastness and unyieldingness, but also points out that the reason why he suffered this disaster was due to his usual detachment from politics and insufficient vigilance against the conspiracies of imperialism. The film also powerfully points out that if it were not for the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism everywhere, the capitalist world and the socialist world could coexist peacefully.
    Similarly, a film with the sabotage activities of US imperialist secret agents as its theme is "Underground Colony." This is based on the true event of the US secret agents' conspiracy to sabotage the Hungarian oil fields in 1948. Before liberation, the Hungarian MAORT Oil Company (operated by American capital) produced a large amount of oil to supply Hitler's war of aggression against the Soviet Union; but after the liberation of Hungary, the productive oil fields owned by the American company declared that their oil sources were exhausted. This is because the American secret agents lurking in the oil company carried out sabotage work in various ways. The purpose of this conspiracy is obvious: when Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, this American-capital oil company produced as much oil as possible to support Hitler; and now, if it continues to produce oil, then the beneficiary will be the Hungarian people, so the American boss must destroy it. However, the heroic Hungarian working class dug out the hidden secret agents and spies and smashed the conspiracy of US imperialism. Soviet experts also provided timely technical assistance, and finally this oil field not only restored its former output, but also contributed more products to Hungary's socialist construction. This film exposes the heinous crimes of US imperialism, which are deliberately hostile to the peaceful people, and shows the patriotism of the Hungarian working class and the internationalist spirit of the Soviet people.
    "Fire" exposes the crimes of illegal capitalists colluding with profiteers to steal state property. This illegal capitalist, the owner of a private factory, not only colluded with big profiteers who specialize in international trade, but also placed a spy in the Hungarian Ministry of Finance. And when the treacherous plan was about to be revealed, this illegal capitalist even planned to set a fire to destroy the evidence. However, thanks to the shrewdness and competence of the Hungarian public security personnel and the cooperation of the patriotic workers and staff inside the factory, the case was finally solved.
    The theme of "Catherine's Marriage" turned to another aspect. This film depicts the textile factory worker Catherine developing hedonistic ideas after marriage, not being active in her work, and doing poorly in her studies. Catherine's husband is a Communist Party member and an advanced model worker. He is very dissatisfied with his wife's backwardness. The relationship between the two deteriorated, and they finally separated. After the separation, under the patient education of the party branch secretary and other comrades, Catherine gradually corrected her mistakes and made significant progress. The Soviet Union shipped a batch of new spinning machines, and the resentful bad elements tried to sabotage the Soviet machines, but Catherine stopped them. Catherine was injured while protecting the machine, her relationship with her husband was restored, and she was approved to join the party.
    From the above brief introduction, it can be seen that Hungarian films, under the guidance of socialist realism, profoundly express the essence of social development, and their combativeness is very strong. These six Hungarian films depict how the Hungarian working people bravely carry out struggles in all aspects—struggling with domestic and foreign, open and hidden enemies, and struggling with the backward thoughts of conservatism, selfishness, and hedonism within the working class, and have won victories one by one. These films, undoubtedly, have a huge educational effect on our audience.
    Finally, in order to understand the whole picture of the development of Hungarian film industry, let us briefly talk about the significant expansion of the number of Hungarian cinemas and the number of audiences in recent years. In 1935, there were a total of 401 cinemas of all sizes in Hungary. After liberation, attention was paid to expanding and building new cinemas in rural areas. In 1950, 228 new rural cinemas were built; in 1951, the total number of rural cinemas reached 911. By 1954, according to the plan, every village could have a cinema. The number of moviegoers was 18.5 million in 1935 (times), 42.3 million in 1949 (times), and reached 80 million in 1951 (times). If this number is compared with the total population of Hungary, one can know how dense its screening network has become.
    With highly ideological and artistic films, and a dense screening network, Hungarian films are able to accomplish the task of serving the people and educating the people.

    人民匈牙利的电影
    茅盾
    在我国二十个大城市内同时举行的匈牙利人民共和国电影周，将于本月二十日开始。这对于加强和巩固中匈两国人民的友谊，促进两国文化、艺术的交流，都将有重大的意义。
    匈牙利人民获得解放，建立了人民民主政权以后，文化、艺术事业便有了巨大而迅速的发展。匈牙利的人民电影在短短的时期内，已经获得了辉煌的成就。这种成就，和匈牙利劳动人民党对于电影事业的正确领导与深切关怀，和匈牙利电影工作者的创造性的劳动，是分不开的。
    自从一九四八年春，亦即匈牙利实施三年计划第二年度的中期，匈牙利电影企业国有化以后，匈牙利的电影艺术便在学习苏联先进经验，并在苏联艺术家的帮助之下，向社会主义现实主义迈进。第一部获得国际声誉的影片是“一寸土”（获一九四九年国际电影节劳动奖）。这部影片及其姊妹片“解放了的土地”可说是匈牙利农民的史诗，它表现了解放以前匈牙利农民对于地主阶级的反抗，以及解放后获得了土地的匈牙利农民以怎样的热情来建设他们的新生活。在“一寸土”中，农民还没有组织起来，但已开始觉悟；影片的主人公对于地主的反抗虽然失败了，但他的坚决反抗已在农民群众中播下了火种，指出了最后胜利者不是剥削者的地主，而是被剥削的农民。它反映了历史的真实，用革命精神指示了前进的道路，这就是“一寸土”的社会主义现实主义的思想方法。在“解放了的土地”中，我们看到的匈牙利农民就和“一寸土”中的不同了，他们是在工人阶级领导之下有组织的群众了，他们是经过改造的新人了，他们已是掌握自己命运的人，以无限的信心建设新的社会。
    随着匈牙利社会主义建设的迅速进展与巨大成就，匈牙利电影在“内容上反映社会主义建设，形式上反映匈牙利民族生活的特色”的指导原则之下，获得了更多更大的成就。它反映了匈牙利社会政治生活中最重要的现象与问题，表现了社会发展的本质，创造了鲜明的新人的典型。
    这次匈牙利电影周所放映的六部影片，其题材和主题思想就是多种多样的，不但给我们看到了匈牙利人民生活的各个重要方面，并且由于它们的思想性的深刻，以及所提出的问题在我们这里也富有现实的意义，所以这些影片对于我国的广大观众是具有重大的教育意义的。
    让我们简单地介绍一下这六部影片的内容。
    “战斗的洗礼”表现了匈牙利的农业生产合作社运动，指出了农业生产合作社的巩固与发展要团结中农，提防富农的挑拨离间与破坏活动。影片深刻地描写了农民思想上存在的问题；暴露了中农的动摇和自私，也批判了误认中农为敌人、而不愿耐心地去争取他们的“左倾”的急性病。“牧鹅少年马季”的题材也是描写农民生活，但不是现代的，而是回顾到二百年前封建时代的匈牙利农村。这是根据十七世纪匈牙利诗人米哈依·法捷卡沙的长诗改编的。影片表现了农民对于地主的憎恨，深刻地描写了牧鹅少年马季如何凭着他的勇敢、机智和决心，以及村中农民的同情与支持，三次打了那个曾经侮辱他的地主。影片巧妙地刻画了农民的勇敢、公正、机智，和地主的贪婪、卑怯、愚蠢。
    “两个世界”表现了以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义侵略阵营和以苏联为首的和平民主阵营对待科学的完全不同的态度——前者使科学服务于毁灭人类的战争，后者使科学服务于和平，提高人民的幸福。影片的故事是这样的：一位正在钻研着新式探煤器的匈牙利著名的地球物理学家，到东柏林出席地质会议。西柏林的美国特务机构指使它所雇佣的美国科学家（他原是那位匈牙利科学家的老友）布置了圈套，将这位匈牙利科学家绑架到西柏林，用尽各种残暴卑劣的手段，企图使这位忠诚地为祖国人民和平幸福服务的科学家，在暴力之下屈服；而用他的新发明的仪器为战争贩子们探寻制造原子武器的原料。但是美国特务完全估计错了。伟大的爱国主义和为人类造福的崇高理想，不是任何暴力所能屈服的。经过了艰苦的奋斗，可敬的匈牙利科学家终于脱出了魔手。影片揭发了美帝国主义的无耻、残忍与阴险，表现了匈牙利科学家的坚贞不屈的高贵品质，但也指出了他之所以遭到这次的祸害，由于他平时的脱离政治，对于帝国主义的阴谋警惕不足。影片并且有力地指出：如果没有美帝国主义的侵略阴谋在到处作怪，资本主义世界和社会主义世界是可以和平共处的。
    同样地，以美帝国主义的特务间谍的破坏活动作为题材的一部影片，是“地下殖民地”。这是根据一九四八年美国特务阴谋破坏匈牙利油田的真实事件而摄制的。解放以前，匈牙利的马克尔特石油公司（美国资本经营的）曾出产了多量石油供给希特勒的侵苏战争；可是在匈牙利解放以后，美国公司所拥有的丰产的油田竟然宣告油源枯竭。这是因为埋伏在石油公司的美国特务间谍用各种方法进行了破坏工作。这种阴谋的目的是显然的：在希特勒进攻苏联的时候，这个美国资本的石油公司就生产尽量多的石油以支持希特勒；而现在呢，如果仍旧生产石油，那么，得益者将是匈牙利人民，所以美国老板非破坏它不可。但是，匈牙利英勇的工人阶级挖出了埋藏着的特务和间谍，粉碎了美帝国主义的阴谋。苏联专家又及时给予技术的帮助，终于这个油田不但恢复了从前的产量，并且以更多的产品贡献给匈牙利的社会主义建设。这个影片暴露了美帝国主义处心积虑与和平人民为敌的万恶罪行，表现了匈牙利工人阶级的爱国主义精神，和苏联人民的国际主义的精神。
    “火”揭发了不法资本家勾结奸商，盗窃国家财产的罪行。这个不法资本家，私营工厂的厂主，不但和专做国际贸易的大奸商有勾结，并且还在匈牙利财政部里安置有坐探。而到奸谋势将败露的时候，这个不法资本家还打算放火灭迹。然而，由于匈牙利公安人员的精明干练，以及工厂内部的爱国的职工们的协力，终于把案情破获。
    “卡塔琳的婚姻”的主题转向了另一方面。这个影片描写纺织工厂的女工卡塔琳在结婚以后滋生了享乐思想，工作不积极，学习也很坏。卡塔琳的丈夫是个共产党员，又是先进的模范工作者，对于妻子的落后很不满意，两人的感情发生裂痕，终于分居。分居后的卡塔琳在党支部书记及其他同志的耐心教育之下，渐渐改正了她的错误，有了显著的进步。苏联运来了一批新式纺纱机，怀恨的坏分子竟想破坏苏联的机器，但被卡塔琳阻止了。卡塔琳为了保护机器而受伤，她和丈夫的感情恢复了，并且被批准入党。
    从上面的简略的介绍，就可以看出，匈牙利的电影在社会主义现实主义的指导原则下，深刻地表现了社会发展的本质，其战斗性是很强烈的。这六部匈牙利电影描写了匈牙利的劳动人民如何勇敢地进行着各方面的斗争——与国内国外、公开的和潜伏的敌人进行斗争，与工人阶级内部的保守、自私、享乐等落后思想进行斗争，并一一取得了胜利。这些影片，无疑地，对于我国观众，是有巨大的教育作用的。
    最后，为了了解匈牙利电影事业发展的全貌，再简略地谈一谈匈牙利的影院数量以及观众的人数，在近年来的显著的扩大。在一九三五年，匈牙利全国共有大小电影院四百零一所。解放后，扩建新电影院的注意力放到农村。一九五○年，新建农村电影院二百二十八所；一九五一年，农村电影院总数已达到九百十一所。到一九五四年，按计划，每个村子都可以有一座电影院。电影观众，一九三五年是一千八百五十万人
    （次），一九四九年是四千二百三十万人（次），一九五一年达到八千万人（次）。如果把这个数目和匈牙利总人口一比较，便知道它的放映网已经稠密到怎样的程度了。
    具有高度思想性和艺术性的影片，和稠密的放映网，匈牙利电影是能够完成为人民服务并教育人民的任务的。
