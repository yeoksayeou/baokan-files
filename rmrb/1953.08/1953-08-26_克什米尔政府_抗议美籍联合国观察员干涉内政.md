    Kashmir Government
    Protests Against US UN Observer Interfering in Internal Affairs
    Xinhua News Agency, Srinagar: The Kashmir government lodged a protest on the 14th with the UN Observer headquarters in Srinagar, accusing UN observer Major Hoke of the United States of engaging in activities that interfere with Kashmir's internal affairs. The Kashmir government stated that Hoke was involved in a demonstration against the Kashmir government. He also interfered with the police who tried to prevent the anti-government demonstration two days earlier.
    According to the "Hindustan Standard," foreigners, including UN observers, were seen moving in jeeps and bicycles on the streets of Srinagar, "distributing sweets and money among those who specialize in causing trouble."

    克什米尔政府
    抗议美籍联合国观察员干涉内政
    据新华社讯：斯利那加消息：克什米尔政府十四日向在斯利那加的联合国观察员总部提出抗议，指责联合国观察员美国人贺克少校进行干涉克什米尔内政的活动。克什米尔政府说：贺克与一次反对克什米尔政府的示威有关。他并干涉那些在两天前想要阻止反对政府的示威游行的警察。
    据“印度斯坦旗报”报道，有人看见外国人包括联合国观察员在内，乘着吉普车和自行车在斯利那加街道上活动，“在专门进行捣乱的人们中间分发糖果和金钱”。
