    The Qingdao Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education Should Guarantee Middle School Teachers Have Rest Time on Sundays

    A group of middle school teachers in Qingdao wrote: The Qingdao Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education frequently requires all middle school teachers to gather on Sundays to listen to reports. These reports take up a lot of time, at least a morning, and sometimes there are discussions after listening. Teachers are already very busy on weekdays, and some even have to take time on Sundays to grade homework or do some professional work. This way, all their time is squeezed out, and they are deprived of rest for a long time. In addition, the Bureau of Culture and Education often lacks planning and organization when organizing reports. Sometimes the content of the reports is vague and chaotic; sometimes two consecutive reports have many overlapping points; sometimes the reports are simply read from documents, which we have already studied collectively in school. Therefore, teachers spend a lot of time listening to reports, but gain little.

    Many teachers have expressed opinions on the Bureau of Culture and Education's practice of not taking care of teachers' rest; leading comrades of the Bureau of Culture and Education have also publicly stated that they would "try to avoid" it in the future. However, the report meetings only stopped for a very short period of time, and the Bureau of Culture and Education frequently gathered teachers to listen to reports on Sundays. Especially towards the end of last semester, when teachers were struggling to prepare for the end of classes, the Bureau of Culture and Education still had teachers listen to reports for an entire morning on July 5th (Sunday).

    In order to take care of the rest and health of middle school teachers, we hope that the Qingdao Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education will pay attention to this issue and try to avoid giving reports on Sundays in the future. If the situation requires it, the Bureau of Culture and Education should also make full preparations in advance to make the report meetings as short as possible while still solving problems.

### 青岛市文教局应该保障中学教员星期日有休息时间

    青岛市文教局应该保障中学教员星期日有休息时间
    青岛市一群中学教员来信：青岛市文教局经常在星期日让全市中学教员集中听报告。这些报告占的时间很长，至少是一个上午，有时听完后还要座谈。教员们平日工作就很忙，有的即使在星期日还要抽时间改作业或搞些业务工作，这样一来时间都被挤掉了，而且搞得长期得不到休息。此外，文教局组织报告时常常缺乏计划和组织，有时报告内容空泛杂乱；有时先后两个报告，许多地方互相重复；有时报告完全是照读文件，而这个文件我们在学校中已经集体学习过了。因此，教员们听报告化了许多时间，收获不大。
    对文教局不照顾教员休息的这种做法，不少教员曾提出过意见；文教局领导同志也曾当众表示以后要“尽量避免”。可是，报告会只停了很短一段时间，文教局又经常集中教员在星期日听报告。尤其上学期将要结束的时候，教员们为了准备结束课业，正忙得喘不过气来；文教局却还在七月五日
    （星期日）让教员们听了整整一上午的报告。
    为了照顾中学教员的休息和健康，我们希望青岛市文教局注意这个问题，今后尽量避免在星期日作报告；如果情况必要的话，文教局在事前也应该作充分准备，使报告会尽量开得短而又能解决问题。
