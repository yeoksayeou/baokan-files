Participating in this construction team are technical workers of various trades, a full complement of Chinese Communist Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres from the company, as well as more than 200 technical cadres. During the organization process, the company's employees regarded being able to participate in this great national construction as the greatest glory, believing that it was the greatest trust placed in them by the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao. Many employees submitted applications to the leadership, requesting to be the first to depart.

In order to strengthen the technical force of this construction team, the East China Construction Engineering Bureau also transferred Wu Shihe, a first-class, first-grade engineer and head of the bureau's technical department, along with six other technical cadres to join the team.

In order to enable the Second Construction Engineering Company to complete its construction business in East China ahead of schedule and promptly dispatch technical cadres to support the Northeast, the East China Construction Engineering Bureau, in addition to promptly allocating the second half of the year's construction tasks undertaken by the company to other companies, also transferred more than 30 technical cadres from the bureau to the Second Construction Engineering Company to take over the unfinished work of the technical personnel who were going to the Northeast.

    这支工程队是以华东建筑工程局第二建筑工程公司职工为主组成的。参加这支工程队的，有各种工种的技术工人、公司的中国共产党的、行政的、工会的和青年团全套干部以及二百多个技术干部。在组织过程中，该公司职工都以能参加祖国这一伟大建设为莫大的光荣，认为这是祖国人民和毛主席对他们最大的信任。许多职工都向上级提出了申请，要求首先出发。
    为了加强这支工程队的技术力量，华东建筑工程局还抽调该局一级一等工程师该局技术处处长吴世鹤与其他六位技术干部参加这个队伍。
