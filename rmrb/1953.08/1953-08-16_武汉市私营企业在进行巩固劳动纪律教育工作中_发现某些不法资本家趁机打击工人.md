In Wuhan, since private enterprises began conducting education to consolidate labor discipline among employees, a few unlawful capitalists, believing that the time for retaliating against workers had arrived, smugly seized the opportunity to exploit loopholes, satirize and strike at workers, and unjustifiably suspend work, wages, and meals. Some even unreasonably demanded the dismissal of workers, attempting to sow discord between the government and the workers. Some capitalists told workers: "The Three-Anti Campaign targeted cadres, the Five-Anti Campaign targeted us, and now the Three-Anti plus Five-Anti—the Eight-Anti (referring to the education to consolidate labor discipline) is targeting you. This time it's even more severe than before." Ji Kang and Wang Gen Ji furniture stores in the Jiang'an district both suspended work in July under the pretext of poor production, and the Yongqing Clothing Store owner stopped providing meals under the pretext of poor business. The owners of Xiong Wantai sheet metal shop and Hongchang clothing store in Wuchang also suspended meals for many days during the labor discipline education campaign. In addition, some unlawful capitalists took the opportunity to demand the dismissal of workers. After the launch of the education to consolidate labor discipline in the printing industry in the Jianghan district, employers proposed to dismiss workers in as many as 21 cases in June and July. Some used the excuse of poor production, while others, like the Santai Printing Factory, simply said the workers' labor discipline was poor and demanded their dismissal. Similar situations occurred in other districts. The chairman of the trade union at the May First Factory in the Jianghan district took leave to return to his hometown and was delayed for three days due to unforeseen circumstances. The employer firmly demanded his dismissal, and loudly clamored to the labor bureau and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, saying: "The chairman of the trade union is taking the lead in violating labor discipline; not dismissing him will simply ruin my factory." The employer of Jianghan Canvas Factory also used every means to take this opportunity to dismiss workers, and incited their own children to provoke workers, attempting to create disputes as a pretext for dismissal.

More seriously, the retaliatory behavior of a few unlawful capitalists even developed to the point of beating workers. For example, on July 9th, Shi Dejing, the owner of Shi Heji Bean Curd Store in Wuchang District, dropped a coal invoice on the ground. When Chen Jishun, a young worker, picked it up for him, he immediately said, "Now we are consolidating labor discipline, not conducting the 'Five-Anti' Campaign. Is there any use in you picking up the invoice? Are you still trying to expose me?" With that, he slapped Chen Jishun several times. In Jiang'an District, several incidents of employers beating and injuring workers occurred in July at Liu Senji Bean Curd Store, Xia Hongfa Board Box Store, and other places.

Other instances of employers mocking, exploiting loopholes, and abusing their "three rights" continued to occur. For example, in a machine factory in Jiang'an District, after the labor discipline education for workers began, the employer blamed all production difficulties on the workers' poor labor discipline at the production research meeting. The employer of a certain light bulb factory raised objections at the labor-management consultation meeting, saying that the workers' "labor discipline" was poor because they only completed their own tasks and did not help others. In some stores, when employees held trade union group meetings to discuss labor discipline and conduct criticism and self-criticism, capitalists eavesdropped, trying to catch workers' "shortcomings." Some factories unreasonably prevented workers from attending necessary meetings, and when shop assistants talked at the counter when there was no business, the boss came out to interfere, saying that their "labor discipline" was poor.

These unlawful capitalists completely distorted the significance of the Communist Party and the trade union's efforts to strengthen labor discipline education for workers in private enterprises, and disregarded their own responsibility for causing lax labor discipline among employees (such as passive management, wage arrears, and neglect of workers' lives and welfare). Instead, they took the opportunity to stir up trouble, which is absolutely intolerable. These egregious behaviors have caused great dissatisfaction among the vast majority of workers and shop assistants, and must be rectified immediately.

    武汉市私营企业在进行巩固劳动纪律教育工作中
    发现某些不法资本家趁机打击工人
    武汉市私营企业在职工中开展巩固劳动纪律的教育以来，少数不法资本家以为对工人进行报复的时机到了，就洋洋自得趁机钻空子，讽刺工人，打击工人，借故停工、停薪、停伙，甚至无理要求解雇工人，挑拨政府和工人之间的关系。有的资本家对工人说：“三反是搞干部的，五反是搞我们的，现在三反加五反——八反（指巩固劳动纪律教育）是整你们的，这一下比以前更厉害。”江岸区济康、王根记家具店都在七月份藉口生产不好停了工，永庆服装店老板藉口生意不好把店里伙食停了。武昌熊万泰白铁店和洪昌服装店老板在劳动纪律教育中也曾借故停伙多日。另外还有部分不法资本家乘机要求解雇工人，江汉区印刷业开展巩固劳动纪律教育后，六、七两月份资方提出要求解雇工人的就有二十一起之多，有的是藉口生产不好，有的像三泰印刷厂干脆说工人劳动纪律不好要求解雇。其他各区也有类似情况发生，江汉区五一工厂工会主席请假回乡，因故多耽搁了三天，资方便坚决要解雇他，并向劳动局、工商联等处大肆叫嚣说：“工会主席带头不遵守劳动纪律，不解雇他简直要把我的厂子搞垮了。”江汉帆布厂资方也用尽了心机想趁这个机会解雇工人，并唆使自己的小孩去惹工人，企图引起争端，好作解雇的藉口。
    更严重的是少数不法资方的报复行为竟发展到殴打工人的地步。如七月九日武昌区史合记豆货店老板史德敬把煤炭的发票掉在地上，青工陈记顺替他捡起来了，他马上就说，现在是搞劳动纪律又不是搞“五反”，你把发票捡起来有用么？还想去检举我不成？说着就打了陈记顺几个耳光。江岸区七月份在刘森记豆货店、夏洪发板箱店等处也有资方打伤工人的事件数起。
    其他对工人冷嘲热讽、钻空子、滥用“三权”的情况也不断发生。如江岸区某机器厂，对工人进行劳动纪律教育开始后，资方就在生产研究会上，把所有生产上的困难都推说是由于工人劳动纪律不好造成的。某灯泡厂资方在劳资协商会上提意见，说工人“劳动纪律”不好，只完成自己的任务，没有帮别人干活。有的店里职工在开工会小组会讨论劳动纪律问题展开批评与自我批评时，资本家就在一旁偷听，想在这里抓工人的“小辫子”。有的厂里无理制止工人出去参加必要的会议，店员们在没有生意的时候在柜台边谈了一下话，老板就出来干涉，说是“劳动纪律”不好。
    这些不法资本家完全歪曲了共产党和工会在私营企业中对工人加强劳动纪律教育的意义，并且无视于造成职工劳动纪律松弛他们本身所应负的责任
    （如消极经营、拖欠工资、不顾工人的生活福利等），反而趁机兴风作浪，实在是不可容忍。这些恶劣行为已使广大工人店员十分不满，必须立予纠正。
