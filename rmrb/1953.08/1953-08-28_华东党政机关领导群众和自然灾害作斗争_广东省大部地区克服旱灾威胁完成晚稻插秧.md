East China: Party and government organs lead the masses in fighting natural disasters
Guangdong Province: Most areas overcome drought threat and complete late rice transplanting

East China: Autumn crops are generally growing well and early rice and early corn have had bumper harvests. However, various provinces have experienced various natural disasters such as drought, flooding, and pests since the summer harvest and planting. During this period, local Party organizations and governments have made disaster relief production the overriding central task in rural areas, taking effective measures in a timely manner to vigorously lead the masses in rescue efforts, striving for a bumper harvest in most areas this autumn.

In June, the central part of East China, including Lu'an, Chuxian, Anqing, and Wuhu in Anhui, and Zhenjiang and Yangzhou in Jiangsu, experienced drought followed by flooding, or both drought and flooding. Under the active leadership of local Party and government organs, by the end of July, the flooded fields in Anhui had been drained, except for a few low-lying areas. Most of the flooded seedlings were replanted in a timely manner, and most of the damaged water conservancy projects were repaired. According to statistics, the three special districts of Anqing, Wuhu, and Lu'an drained more than 2.92 million mu of flooded land during this period, accounting for more than 80 percent of the flooded land in the area. The 350,000+ Mu in Anqing Special District replanted accounted for over 80 percent of what had been intended. As of now, the drought and flood disasters that have occurred in the above-mentioned areas and Jiangsu have been resolved one after another.

After July, many areas in northern East China's Shandong, such as Heze, Huxi, Liaocheng, Tengxian, Linyi, Dezhou, Taian, and Laiyang, experienced continuous heavy rains, resulting in flooding, with a wide affected area. In the south, Fujian and Zhejiang experienced more severe drought conditions. Many areas in Fujian have experienced varying degrees of drought since late June. Although typhoons brought showers in early July, which slightly reduced the drought, the weather has been sunny and dry in recent months, and the drought has become more severe. Some areas in Zhejiang have also experienced drought. With the occurrence of drought and flooding, pests, diseases and weeds have also emerged. For example, rice stem borers and rice blast in some areas of Zhejiang and Fujian, aphid damage in some cotton-producing areas of Shandong, cricket plagues in Huxi, Shandong and Suxian, Anhui, and the spread of second-generation armyworms in Wendeng, Laiyang, and Jiaozhou.

The above-mentioned disasters have attracted the attention of local Party and government organs. The East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Shandong Branch Bureau, and the Fujian and Zhejiang Provincial Party Committees of the CPC have successively issued urgent instructions, dispatched a large number of cadres to organize inspection teams to go to the disaster areas to guide rescue efforts. The Shandong Branch Bureau and the provincial government sent cadres at the level of department director, bureau director, and director to lead the groups to guide the masses in flood prevention and drainage. The Fujian Provincial Party Committee sent cadres at the level of minister, and the provincial government sent cadres at the level of department director to lead the groups to go to various special districts to guide drought relief. The Jinjiang and Nanping Prefectural Committees organized 1,600 cadres from the special districts and counties to go to the countryside to assist in rescue efforts. Shandong issued 12 billion yuan in production disaster relief loans and allocated more than 300,000 jin of reserve seeds. Fujian issued 10 billion yuan in production disaster relief loans to support the masses in production and self-rescue. At the same time, trade and cooperative departments were organized to actively solve the difficulties of farmers in production materials such as irrigation tools and insecticidal machinery, as well as daily necessities, to support the masses. For example, cooperatives in Shandong Province allocated and supplied farmers with 100,000 sprayers, 4.28 million jin of various insecticides, and 5 million jin of native tobacco. The Fujian provincial-level organs organized 37 water pumps and all drought-resistant tools to fight the drought. They also widely organized handicraftsmen to build a large number of waterwheels and other drought-resistant tools. This greatly boosted the morale of the masses and also effectively solved many difficulties for the masses.

In leading the masses in fighting drought and draining floods, all localities have proposed to make good use of the masses' existing experience in fighting drought and draining floods, and to implement the policy of mutual assistance and mutual benefit. For example, in drought-stricken areas, the masses are led to actively develop water sources, use water rationally, and use tools rationally. In flood-drained areas, the principle of "overall planning and mutual care" is mastered to eliminate drainage disputes among the masses. Therefore, the production and disaster relief work in the above-mentioned areas has achieved remarkable results. Taking Shandong as an example, by the end of July, more than 4 million mu of seedlings had been drained and rescued, and armyworms and cotton field pests had been basically eradicated.

Since August, the drought situation in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui and other provinces has become serious again. It was not until mid-August that various places gradually experienced rainfall due to the influence of typhoons. After the rain, the above-mentioned local people's governments seized the opportunity to mobilize the masses to rush to plant late autumn crops such as buckwheat and carrots to strive to harvest more grain to prevent spring famine next year. In addition, the people's governments at all levels are also actively organizing the masses to prepare for continued drought resistance and flood prevention to ensure this year's autumn harvest. The Party and government leading organs in areas that have not been affected by the disaster and areas where the disaster has been lifted are calling on the masses to be vigilant, to guard against complacency, and to strictly prevent the attack of disasters.

Guangdong Province has been hot and dry with little rain since mid-June, and drought has gradually occurred. By mid-July, the drought situation in the province was extremely serious, especially in northern Guangdong, western Guangdong, and central Guangdong, where drought was almost universal. Many rice fields were cracked, seedlings died from drought, and some farmers had difficulty getting drinking water. The Party and government organs at all levels in Guangdong Province attached importance to the above situation. The South China Branch Bureau of the CPC promptly instructed all localities to pay close attention to the drought situation, emphasizing that drought resistance and prevention, seedling protection and rush planting are the central tasks that override everything else in the current rural areas. The Guangdong Provincial People's Government promptly allocated 3.5 billion yuan for drought relief funds. He Ximing, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, Wang Gengsheng, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Zhao Ziyang, Secretary-General of the South China Branch Bureau of the CPC, and Li Ming, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department, went to northern Guangdong, western Guangdong, central Guangdong, and eastern Guangdong to assist in leading drought relief work. The Party committees and administrative offices of various regions also transferred a large number of cadres led by responsible cadres of various departments to go deep into the countryside with county and district cadres to lead the masses in drought resistance. After more than a month of efforts, many areas have overcome the drought, solved the water shortage problem in the rice fields, and ensured the smooth progress of late rice transplanting. At present, most areas of the province have overcome the threat of drought and completed the late rice transplanting work. Some areas in Hainan, eastern Guangdong, and western Guangdong, where the season is earlier, have entered the mid-cultivation stage. On August 13th and 14th, there was widespread rainfall throughout the province. Areas that have not been transplanted are seizing the opportunity to rush to transplant after the rain. In order to ensure that the seedlings grow well, the work of drought resistance and seedling protection is still being strengthened.

    华东党政机关领导群众和自然灾害作斗争
    广东省大部地区克服旱灾威胁完成晚稻插秧
    华东各地目前一般秋季作物生长良好，早稻、早玉蜀黍已告丰收。但各省均有若干地区，自夏收夏种以来连续出现旱、涝、病虫害等各种自然灾害。这一个时期，各地党组织、政府都以抗灾生产为农村压倒一切的中心任务，及时采取有效措施，大力领导群众进行抢救，力争绝大部分地区秋季丰收。
    六月间，华东中部安徽的六安、滁县、安庆、芜湖和江苏的镇江、扬州等地区，先旱后涝，或有旱有涝。在当地党政机关积极领导群众抢救下，到七月底，安徽被淹田地除少数洼地外，一般涝地积水都已排出，被淹禾苗大部及时补种，冲毁的水利工程也大部修复。据统计：安庆、芜湖、六安三个专区在这一个时期排出涝地二百九十二万多亩，占该地受涝地亩的百分之八十以上；安庆专区补种三十五万多亩，占其应补种面积也在百分之八十以上。截止目前，上述地区和江苏已发生的旱涝灾害，已经先后解除。
    七月以后，华东北部的山东不少地区，如菏泽、湖西、聊城、滕县、临沂、德州、泰安、莱阳等地，连降大雨，酿成涝灾，受灾面积较广。南部的福建、浙江则旱情较重。福建很多地区自六月下旬以来就发生了轻重不同的旱情。七月初虽台风带来阵雨，使该地旱情一度稍减，但近月来又天晴不雨，旱情又趋严重。浙江若干地区也发生旱象。随着旱涝的发生，并产生了病虫害和草荒。如浙江、福建某些地区发生的三化螟虫和二化螟虫、稻热病，山东等某些产棉区的蚜虫为害，山东湖西、安徽宿县等地的蟋蟀成灾，以及文登、莱阳、胶州等地的二代行军虫的蔓延等。
    上述灾情，都引起了当地党政机关的高度注意，中共中央华东局、山东分局、中共福建省委和浙江省委，先后下达了紧急指示，大量抽调干部组织检查组，分赴受灾地区指导抢救。山东分局和省府派出厅长、局长、主任等干部领导各组指导群众防汛、排涝。福建省委派出部长、省府派出厅长一级干部领导各组分赴各专区指导抗旱，晋江、南平地委组织专区及县的干部一千六百人下乡协助抢救。山东发放生产救灾贷款一百二十亿元，调拨备荒种子三十多万斤，福建发放生产救灾贷款一百亿元，支持群众生产自救。同时并组织贸易、合作部门，积极为农民解决灌溉工具、捕虫药械等生产资料，以及生活资料的困难，以支援群众。如山东省合作社调拨、供应农民喷雾器十万具，各种杀虫药剂四百二十八万斤，土烟五百万斤。福建省级机关组织了三十七部抽水机及一切抗旱工具出动抗旱。并广泛组织了手工业者，大量修造水车等抗旱工具。这样，给群众情绪很大鼓舞，也切实解决了群众的很多困难。
    在领导群众抗旱、排涝中，各地提出要很好利用群众中已有的抗旱、排涝经验，贯彻互助互利的政策。如在抗旱地区，即领导群众积极开发水源，合理用水，合理使用工具。在排涝地区则掌握了“统筹全局，相互照顾”的原则，以消除群众中的排水纠纷。因此，上述地区的生产抗灾工作，获得显著成效。以山东为例，至七月底，已排水救出禾苗四百多万亩，行军虫和棉田虫害已基本上扑灭。
    八月以来，福建、浙江、江苏、安徽等省旱象又呈严重，直到八月中旬，各地方因台风影响，逐渐降雨。雨后，以上各地人民政府都抓紧时机，发动群众抢种荞麦、胡萝卜等晚秋作物，争取多收粮食，以防明年春荒。另外，各地人民政府还积极组织群众，准备继续抗旱和防汛，以确保今年的秋收。未受灾地区和灾情已经解除的地区的党政领导机关，则号召群众提高警惕，力戒麻痹，严防灾害的袭击。
    广东省自六月中旬以来，天气炎热少雨，旱象逐渐发生。七月中旬全省旱象已极严重；其中以粤北、粤西、粤中尤甚，差不多普遍受旱，许多禾田干裂，秧苗旱死，有些农民吃水都感到困难。广东省各级党、政机关都重视了上述情况，中共华南分局及时指示各地密切注意旱情，强调以抗旱防旱，保苗抢种作为当前农村压倒一切的中心任务。广东省人民政府及时拨出三十五亿元的抗旱救济款。广东省人民政府副主席贺希明、农林厅长王更生、中共华南分局秘书长赵紫阳、组织部副部长李明等并分赴粤北、粤西、粤中、粤东等地协助领导抗旱工作。各区党委、行署也抽调大批干部由各部门负责干部率领，配合县、区干部深入乡村，领导群众进行抗旱。经过一个多月的努力，许多地区战胜了旱灾，解决了禾田的缺水困难，保证了晚稻插秧工作得以顺利进行。现在，全省大部地区克服了旱灾的威胁，完成了晚稻插秧工作，季节较早的海南、粤东、粤西的部分地区已进入中耕阶段。八月十三、十四两日，全省又普遍下雨，在没有插秧的地区，正抓紧雨后进行抢插。在已插下去的，为了保证秧苗长得好，仍在继续加强抗旱保苗工作。
