    Inspection of Substitute Farming Work in Xiba Village, Changzhi County
    Readers Li Qiming, Song Xiangbao, and Wang Lingxiang wrote: The People's Government of Xiba Village, Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, recently conducted an inspection and evaluation of the village's substitute farming work in order to celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day and strengthen the masses' understanding of substitute farming. The inspection and evaluation revealed the following: The cornfield cultivated by the agricultural production cooperative for military family member Cui Xiaoxiu was top-dressed twice, and the seedlings are now growing very well, with 1,100 plants per mu. Estimating half a jin per plant, the yield is expected to be more than 550 jin per mu, compared to only 300 jin per mu last year. Another case is that the millet field cultivated by Li Laishun's substitute farming group for military family member Yang Maochun has sufficient fertilizer and was hoed twice. The millet is growing very well, and the estimated yield is 350 jin per mu, exceeding last year's yield by 120 jin. However, there are also some cases of particularly poor substitute farming, such as the land cultivated by Song Heidan's group for military family member Song Chouze. The fertilizer was insufficient, and the seedlings are not growing well. The weeding was also done perfunctorily and sparsely, about 40% less than usual, which will definitely affect the harvest. Furthermore, Song Xiaohei and two other substitute farming groups did not plan to top-dress or hoe twice the land of military family members. After their mistakes were pointed out, they have now applied top-dressing and hoed twice. The remaining twelve substitute farming groups have performed normally, but all have applied top-dressing and hoed twice. After the inspection, a meeting of relevant personnel was convened. At the meeting, the good performers were commended, and the poor performers were criticized. Everyone unanimously recognized that failing to do a good job in substitute farming would let down the volunteers and the People's Liberation Army. Farmers Li Situ and Xu Wanfu took the lead and immediately stated that they would each accumulate 300 jin of wheat fertilizer for the land they were cultivating, and other substitute farming households responded enthusiastically. Everyone unanimously guaranteed that they would prioritize the families of martyrs and military personnel before themselves and use practical actions to demonstrate their importance to the substitute farming work.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    长治县西八村检查代耕工作
    读者李岐明、宋乡保、王伶香来信：山西省长治县西八村人民政府，为了庆祝“八一”建军节，为了加强群众对代耕工作的认识，最近对全村代耕工作进行了一次检查评比。在检查评比中发现有这样一些情况：农业生产合作社给军属崔小秀代耕的玉米地，上了两遍追肥，现在苗长得很好，每亩一千一百棵，每棵按半斤计算，约可收五百五十多斤，而去年每亩只收了三百斤。另一是李来顺代耕组给军属杨茂春代耕的地，肥料足，拉二遍，现在谷子长得很好，预计每亩可收三百五十多斤，将超过去年一百二十斤的产量。但也有一些代耕得特别坏的，如宋黑旦组给军属宋臭则代耕的地，肥料不足，苗长得不好，锄苗时也只是应付一下，锄得很稀，比一般的少百分之四十，这当然要影响到收成。还有宋小黑等三个代耕组，不准备给军属的土地上追肥，拉二遍，经指出他们的错误后，现在他们已给上了追肥，拉了二遍。其余十二个代耕组代耕的情况平常，但都上了追肥，拉了二遍。检查后，召开了有关人员的大会。在会上对好的进行了表扬，坏的给予批评。大家一致认识到：做不好代耕工作，就对不起志愿军、解放军。农民李四秃、徐万福首先当场表示，每人要给自己代耕的土地积麦肥三百斤，其他代耕户也纷纷响应。大家一致保证今后决先烈军属、后自己，用实际行动来说明对代耕工作的重视。
