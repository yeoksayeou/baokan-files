The Northeast Coal Mine Bureau recently convened a coal mine geological exploration meeting. The meeting summarized and inspected the coal mine geological exploration work in the first half of this year, and decided to vigorously strengthen leadership over coal mine geological work, reversing the current serious situation where geological exploration work cannot keep up with the requirements of national construction.

The Northeast coal mine geological exploration work did not complete its tasks well in the first half of this year. Except for the Jiaohe and other four mining bureaus which exceeded their plans, other bureaus failed to complete their plans, with the Fushun Mining Bureau being the worst. The quality and efficiency of geological exploration work in many mines did not meet standards, and cost overruns were serious, which seriously affected the progress of coal mine construction work in the Northeast. The meeting discussed the reasons for the failure to complete the geological exploration work plan: First, the organizational leadership was unsound. The production tasks of various coal mines in the Northeast were not completed well in the first half of this year. Therefore, the leaders of the various bureaus were busy with production work, and relaxed their leadership over geological work. Some geological exploration departments even formed a leaderless, laissez-faire state. No one cared even if the tasks were not completed for several months, resulting in lax management in some geological exploration departments, a lack of work systems, a large organization, too many management personnel, and too few technical personnel, so technical leadership could not be strengthened. Second, there was blindness in the planning of geological exploration work. The geological exploration work must be carried out in accordance with certain scientific procedures. Some projects that did not have the conditions were also included in the construction projects. For example, the geological survey of the Jinzhou Gang area has not been completed, and there is no complete geological data, but it was included in the well construction plan, requiring detailed investigation and construction to begin this year. Similar situations exist in many other regions. Some mines, in formulating plans, started from localism, only seeking the development of their own mining areas, without considering the needs and possibilities of the entire country. They only wanted to clarify the geological conditions of their own mining areas, and included many projects that could or could not be carried out in production in the plan, thus dispersing their strength. Third, technical leadership in geological exploration work is weak, and leading cadres have always lacked understanding of the importance of strengthening geological work. Many drilling projects have no technical guidance and do not follow procedures. For example, the Chengzishan Mine blindly drilled without clarifying the geological conditions, resulting in the cross-sectional diagrams of several drilling lines not being comparable. The Tonghua Iron Factory blindly drilled without conducting a geological survey. Five drills were made without finding a coal seam, and the original plan had to be changed to supplement the geological survey work. Some did not propose expected columnar diagrams before drilling construction, and some did, but the quality was low and could not guide construction. There was also a lack of research and整理 (zhěnglǐ - to arrange, sort out) of data after drilling, and geological reports could not be submitted on time, making design impossible. The research work of geological data lacks the necessary connection with production mines. There was insufficient collection and organization of past geological data. For example, the Zhonggang of Jiaohe had drilled eighteen drills during the Manchukuo period, but the Jiaohe Mine did not analyze and appraise these reference materials, and discarded them all, and re-arranged dozens of drills, which caused repeated waste in drilling construction. However, some mines (such as the Xi'an Mine) over-believed in old data, which is also incorrect. There was also a lack of technical management in drilling construction, and the construction design plan, management charts, and drilling structure diagrams were not carefully implemented. The work of promoting and consolidating the Soviet Union's advanced experience in geological drilling was also not done well enough.

The meeting launched a discussion based on the above issues, further clarified the importance of completing this year's national plan, criticized the tendency of geological work not asking about production, and clearly pointed out that the ultimate purpose of coalfield geological exploration work is to mine coal. Therefore, in addition to serving the construction of new mines, it must also serve the production mines, collect data from the production mines, understand the reserves of the production wellheads, and master the development prospects of the coalfield, so that the national production plan has a reliable basis. In order to correct the chaos in past plans, the meeting re-examined the geological exploration plan of Northeast coal mines this year according to the principle of need and possibility, reduced the drilling projects in the plan that could not be carried out, could be carried out less, or had unclear geological conditions, and determined the focus of construction. Projects that were calculated incorrectly in the past were corrected and supplemented.

In order to quickly reverse the backward situation of coal mine geological exploration work in the Northeast, the meeting decided to reasonably organize and adjust the existing coal mine geological exploration forces in the Northeast, implement unified allocation, improve the organization, and concentrate the use of forces. The various mining bureaus will study and formulate practical and feasible specific measures plans in accordance with the spirit of the meeting, improve efficiency on the basis of ensuring quality, and strive to complete this year's tasks. In order to strengthen geological work, it was decided to focus on adjusting and supplementing geological personnel, transferring several coal mining technicians from the design department to the grassroots units to do geological data work, ensuring that geological reports are submitted in a timely manner after drilling is completed; and strengthening the training and education of existing and newly transferred technical personnel to improve their professional level. In addition, in order to improve the frequent accidents in exploration work, it was decided to continue to implement the operating procedures, improve and establish various responsibility systems, and establish and improve the reporting system between superiors and subordinates, in order to achieve flexible responses between superiors and subordinates and timely reflect and solve problems.

    东北召开煤矿地质勘探会议
    决定大力加强煤矿地质工作
    东北煤矿管理局日前召开了煤矿地质勘探会议，总结检查了今年上半年煤矿地质勘探工作，决定大力加强对煤矿地质工作的领导，扭转目前地质勘探工作跟不上国家建设要求的严重状况。
    东北煤矿地质勘探工作今年上半年任务完成得不好，除蛟河等四个矿务局超过计划外，其它各局均未完成计划，其中以抚顺矿务局为最差。许多矿的地质勘探工作质量、效率都达不到标准，超支情况严重，这就严重影响了东北煤矿建设工作的进行。会上大家研究了地质勘探工作完不成计划的原因：首先是组织领导不健全。东北各煤矿今年上半年生产任务完成得不好，因此各局领导方面都忙于生产工作，放松了对地质工作的领导，有的地质勘探部门甚至形成无领导的自流状态，接连数月未完成任务也无人过问，致使有些地质勘探部门管理松懈，缺乏工作制度，机构庞大，管理人员过多，技术人员过少，使技术领导不能加强。其次，是地质勘探工作在制订计划上存在着盲目性，不懂得地质勘探工作必须按照一定的科学程序办事，把一些不具备条件的工程也列入了施工项目中，如金州岗地质调查尚未完成，还没有完整的地质资料，就列入了建井计划，要求在今年开始精查和施工。其他不少地区都有类似情况。有些矿在制订计划中从本位主义出发，只求本矿区的发展，不考虑整个国家的需要和可能，只想弄清本矿区的地质情况，把很多生产上可打可不打的项目列入计划要求施工，因而分散了力量。第三，地质勘探工作中技术领导薄弱，领导干部对加强地质工作一直认识不足，许多钻井工程没有技术指导，不按程序办事，如城子河矿没有弄清地质情况就盲目钻探，结果几个钻探线上的断面图都对比不出来。通化铁厂未作地质调查就盲目钻探，打了五个钻都未找到煤层，不得不变更原计划，补作地质调查工作。有的在钻探施工前不提出预想柱状图，有的虽然作了，但质量低，不能指导施工。钻探后也缺乏研究整理资料的工作，不能按时提出地质报告，使设计无法进行。地质资料的研究工作缺乏和生产矿井的必要联系。对过去地质资料搜集整理不够，如蛟河中岗在伪满时期曾打过十八钻，但蛟河矿对这些可供参考的资料未加分析鉴定，一律废弃，重新布置了数十个钻井，这就造成了钻探施工的重复浪费。但有的矿又过分相信旧资料（如西安矿），这也是不正确的。在钻探施工中也缺乏技术管理工作，对施工设计计划书，管理图表和钻井构造图等都未认真执行。地质钻探中推广与巩固苏联先进经验的工作也做得不够。
    会议根据以上问题展开了讨论，进一步明确了完成今年国家计划的重要性，并批判了地质工作不问生产的偏向，明确指出煤田地质勘探工作的最终目的是为了采煤，因此它除了为建设新矿井服务以外，还必须为生产矿井服务，向生产矿井搜集资料，了解生产井口的埋藏量，掌握煤田的发展远景，使国家生产计划有可靠根据。为纠正过去计划中的混乱现象，会议根据需要与可能的原则，对今年东北煤矿的地质勘探计划重新进行了审查，削减了计划中可不打，可少打或地质情况不明的钻探项目，确定了施工重点，过去计算不正确的工程则作了修正和补充。
    为了迅速扭转东北煤矿地质勘探工作的落后状况，会议决定合理的组织与调整东北现有煤矿地质勘探力量，实行统一的调配，并健全机构，集中使用力量。各矿务局将根据会议的精神进行研究后订出切实可行的具体措施计划，在保证质量的基础上提高效率，力争完成今年的任务。为加强地质工作，决定重点的调整和充实地质人员，从设计部门中抽调若干采煤技术人员充实到基层单位作地质资料工作，保证钻探竣工后及时提出地质报告；对现有和新调的技术人员加强培养教育，以提高业务水平。另外，为改善勘探工作中事故频繁的状况，决定继续贯彻执行操作规程，健全和建立各种责任制度，建立和健全上下级之间的汇报报告制度，以求得上下间呼应灵活，及时反映和解决问题。
