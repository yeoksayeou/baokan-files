Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 25th: Since the factories and mines in Anshan City launched the mechanization and automation movement to transform old production equipment, they have achieved great success. Half a year ago, only the small rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was engaged in this movement. Now, the movement has expanded to the rolling, smelting, power, machinery, transportation, mining, and other production departments of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, as well as local state-owned factories in Anshan City. Many construction companies and construction sites in the capital construction sector have also launched this movement. According to recent incomplete statistics, in this movement, more than 16,000 employees in the city have put forward 547 suggestions of significant value related to mechanization and automation. Among these suggestions, 469 have been reviewed and approved for adoption, and the equipment related to 299 of the suggestions has already been successfully manufactured.

Through this movement, factories and mining enterprises in Anshan City have improved many outdated equipment and harsh, heavy labor conditions, significantly increasing the output and quality of products, thereby creating a large amount of wealth for the country. The initiator of the mechanization and automation movement – the first workshop of the small rolling mill – now has a production process that is basically mechanized and automated. In the past, the welding rod workshop of the General Machinery Plant had seven production processes. Except for the cutting process, which used machines, the other processes were completely manual. During the mechanization and automation movement, the employees of this workshop created various mechanical equipment for manufacturing welding rods, eliminating the need for manual operation in all processes. After initial testing, the output of these mechanical equipment increased threefold compared to manual operation, and the product quality also met the standards required for capital construction. Due to the significant increase in labor productivity, this workshop can increase production and save more than 20 billion yuan for the country each year. In the past, when the metal products factory's rolling workshop was in production, workers carried cold steel billets into the heating furnace, or sent hot steel billets to the rolling mill, and red-hot wire rods to the wire winding machine, all of which were done under high temperatures. Since the employees created mechanized and automated equipment, the workers' labor conditions have not only been fundamentally changed, but labor productivity has also increased by 16.7 percent compared to last year. Furthermore, they are able to mass-produce new products for capital construction that could not be manufactured before. Due to the improvement of equipment, this workshop can create more than 46 billion yuan of wealth for the country each year. In the steel wire rope factory, after the old worker Li Genyuan and others created eight pieces of mechanized and automated equipment, the output of products was greatly increased. The factory's output in April increased by 35.7 percent compared to March, and in May it increased by 5.2 percent compared to April. When the machinery department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was overhauling the No. 2 blast furnace, it also adopted mechanized construction in many projects, completing the overhaul task six days ahead of schedule. In terms of capital construction, after the brick-laying company successfully created and improved the refractory brick grinding machine and drilling machine, the working efficiency of these two machines increased by 19 to 49 times, respectively, compared to the past. The electric drill created by the rolling mill company increased the working efficiency of making cement cable pipe models by 60 times. In addition, in the carpentry workshop of the civil engineering company, in medium-sized factories, and in the individual processes of many factories and mines, many old equipment have also been transformed into mechanized and automated equipment.

The mechanized and automated equipment created by the employees not only created a large amount of wealth for the country, but more importantly, it enabled the workers to gradually break away from the dangerous and heavy labor conditions left over from the old enterprises. For example, in the past, the ore dressing plant needed 90 people per shift to push the pellet ore trucks. After the trucks came out of the pellet ore furnace with a temperature of more than 1,000 degrees, 20 people were needed to pull and push them. After the employees created mechanized equipment, only 15 workers were needed per shift, which was more efficient than before. During the period of the puppet Manchurian regime, casualties always occurred every time a blast furnace was repaired. This year, during the major overhaul of the No. 2 blast furnace, not only were there no casualties, but more than 500 labor forces were saved. Due to the transformation of some old equipment during construction, more than 800 workers were freed from heavy physical labor and high-temperature operations. Most of the equipment improved by many enterprises and units were transformed and created by workers using old equipment and old materials, so the transformation funds spent were very small. For example, the seven pieces of equipment transformed by the steel wire rope factory only cost 50 million yuan, while the wealth created by these equipment each year, only the part that can be calculated, is more than 500 million yuan. Although the metal products factory can increase production by more than 46 billion yuan for the country after the equipment is transformed, it only cost more than 40 million yuan to transform those old equipment. "Small investment, big return" is the characteristic of every suggestion related to mechanization and automation.

In order to carry out this movement in an organized and guided manner, the relevant leading organs of Anshan City held three city-wide experience promotion conferences for small rolling mills in the first half of the year, and organized more than 7,000 workers, technicians, or factory and mine directors to visit the small rolling mill. Many factories and mines also invited comrades from the small rolling mill to introduce their experience in carrying out the mechanization and automation movement to their units.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 25th: The mechanization and automation exhibition held by Anshan Iron and Steel Company opened on August 18th. The content of the exhibition is very rich, displaying charts showing the great achievements made by Anshan Iron and Steel Company since it launched the mechanization and automation movement, and it is filled with models of various mechanized and automated equipment improved or created by the employees. The charts and various models exhibited fully illustrate that as long as the leadership of factory and mining enterprises seriously mobilize the masses of employees, they can transform old equipment into mechanized equipment without spending a lot of money. During the exhibition, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, the Iron and Steel Industry Administration, and the preparatory committee of the Chinese Hardware and Smelting Workers' Union jointly organized representatives from factories and mines and trade unions from all over the country to visit. As of the 19th of this month, 84 representatives from Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Dalian, Changchun, and other places have arrived in Anshan, and they are visiting with great interest.

    鞍山市各工厂和矿山
    开展机械化自动化运动成就很大
    鞍山钢铁公司举办机械化自动化展览会
    【新华社鞍山二十五日电】鞍山市各工厂矿山开展改造旧生产设备的机械化自动化运动以来，已获得巨大成就。半年以前，开展这一运动的还只有鞍山钢铁公司小型轧钢厂一个单位，到目前，这个运动已扩展到鞍山钢铁公司所属的轧钢、冶炼、动力、机械、运输、矿山等生产部门和鞍山市地方国营的工厂；许多基本建设部门的工程公司和工地，也开展了这一运动。根据最近不完全的统计，在这一运动中，全市有一万六千多职工提出了有重大价值的有关机械化自动化的建议五百四十七件。在这些建议中，有四百六十九件经过审查确定采用，其中有二百九十九件建议的有关设备已经制造成功。
    通过这一运动，鞍山市各工厂、矿山企业改进了许多陈旧的设备和恶劣、笨重的劳动条件，显著地提高了产品的产量和质量，从而为国家创造了大量的财富。机械化自动化运动的首倡者——小型轧钢厂的一车间，现在生产过程已基本上机械化自动化了。机械总厂制焊条的车间，从前的七道生产工序除剪断工序是用机器外，其他工序完全是手工操作。在开展机械化自动化运动中，这个车间的职工创造了制造焊条的各种机械设备，使各种工序都不用手工操作。这些机械设备经过初步试验，产品的产量比手工操作时提高了三倍，产品质量也达到基本建设所需要的标准。由于劳动生产率的显著提高，这个车间每年可为国家增产节约二百多亿元。金属制品厂压延车间过去在进行生产时，工人们搬运冷钢坯送进加热炉，或是把烧热的钢坯送到轧钢机、把火红的线材送到卷线机，都是在高温下操作的；自从职工们创造出机械化自动化的设备以后，工人的劳动条件不但得到根本改变，劳动生产率也比去年增加了百分之十六点七，并且能够大量生产以前不能制造的基本建设用的新产品。由于设备的改进，这个车间每年可为国家创造四百六十多亿元的财富。在钢绳厂，老工人栗根源等创造出八件机械化自动化设备以后，大大提高了产品的产量。该厂四月份的产量比三月份提高百分之三十五点七，五月份又比四月份提高了百分之五点二。鞍山钢铁公司机械处在检修二号炼铁炉时，也在许多工程方面采用了机械化施工，结果提前六天完成了检修任务。在基本建设方面，筑炉公司创造和改进的耐火砖磨砖机和钻眼机成功以后，使这两部机器的工作效率比过去分别提高了十九倍到四十九倍。轧钢公司创造的电钻，使制作洋灰电缆管模型的工作效率提高了六十倍。此外，在土建公司木工场，在中型厂，在许多厂矿的个别工序上，也有不少的旧设备，改造成为机械化自动化了。
    职工们创造的机械化自动化设备，不仅为国家创造了大量财富，更重要的是使工人们逐渐摆脱了旧企业遗留下来的险恶笨重的劳动条件。例如选矿厂过去推运团矿的台车，每班需要九十个人工。台车从一千多度高温的团矿炉出来以后，要用二十个人前拉后推。职工们创造出机械化设备以后，每班只需要十五个工人操作，比以往的工作效率还高。在伪满统治时期，每修一次高炉，总要发生伤亡事故；今年大修二号高炉时，不但没有发生伤亡事故，而且节省了五百多劳动力。由于施工中改造了一些旧的设备，有八百多工人摆脱了笨重的体力劳动和高温操作。许多企业单位改进的大部分设备，都是工人们利用旧的设备和旧的材料改造和创制成功的，因此花费的改造资金很少。如钢绳厂改造的七件设备只花了五千万元，而这些设备每年创造的财富只是能够计算的部分就有五亿多元。金属制品厂改造设备后，虽然一年可为国家增产四百六十多亿元，但改造那些旧设备只花费了四千多万元。“用钱少、收效大”，这是每件有关机械化自动化的建议的特点。
    为了有组织有领导地开展这一运动，鞍山市有关领导机关在上半年曾举行了三次全市性的推广小型轧钢厂经验大会，并先后组织了七千多名工人、技术人员或厂矿长到小型轧钢厂参观访问。许多厂矿还邀请小型轧钢厂的同志到本单位介绍了开展机械化自动化运动的经验。
    【新华社鞍山二十五日电】鞍山钢铁公司举办的机械化自动化展览会于八月十八日开幕。展览会的内容很丰富，展览着鞍山钢铁公司开展机械化自动化运动以来获得巨大成就的图表，并且布满了职工们改进或创造的各种机械化自动化设备的模型。展览会展出的图表和各种模型，充分地说明了只要厂矿企业的领导方面认真发动职工群众，不用花很多钱，就可以把旧的设备改造成为机械化设备。展览会在展览期间，中央人民政府重工业部、钢铁工业管理局和中国五金冶炼工会筹备委员会，共同组织了全国各地的厂矿、工会代表前来参观。到本月十九日止，已有北京、上海、重庆、大连、长春等地的八十四个代表到达鞍山，他们正抱着极大的兴趣在参观。
