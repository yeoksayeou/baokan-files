    Kashmir Constituent Assembly Speaker Delivers Radio Address
    Opposing Imperialist Aggressive Plots in Kashmir
    [Xinhua News Agency, Srinagar, August 28th] According to a report from the Indian Press Trust in Srinagar: The Speaker of the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly, Sadiq, delivered a radio address on Kashmir Radio on August 15th, exposing the plot of imperialist warmongers to turn Kashmir into a war base. Sadiq also called on the people of India, Pakistan, and Kashmir to unite in support of the struggle against imperialist plots, saving India and Pakistan from the ravages of war.
    Sadiq said: "We must remember that the imperialist countries, hoping to plunge the world into another world war and endanger world peace, are paying attention to Kashmir. Because its geographical location borders the national boundaries of five major countries, Kashmir has an important position. This position has attracted the attention of imperialist warmongers. The nature of these countries' despicable intentions towards us has been exposed by their attitude in the United Nations. Their actions in the Kashmir Valley have contributed to our opposition to them."
    Speaking of recent events in the state, he said: "This is the result of a conspiracy by imperialist countries, which are inciting sectarianism and division. A new government has recently been formed in Kashmir because certain individuals in the old government were manipulated by these countries, which want to turn Kashmir into a war base to endanger world peace."
    Finally, Sadiq said: "On this occasion, we have once again made a firm decision: we will not let the sacrifices of our martyrs be in vain. We will never allow imperialism to gain a foothold in our country. We will thwart their vicious plots."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, August 24th] News from Bombay: Kashmir Constituent Assembly Speaker Sadiq, in a statement in Bombay on the 21st, welcomed the recent talks in Delhi between Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali. He said that the agreement between Nehru and Ali suits certain demands that the people of Kashmir have been striving to achieve for many years. Sadiq explained these demands, saying: "We oppose the appointment of U.S. Admiral Nimitz as the plebiscite administrator. We also do not want to appoint any person from the Anglo-American bloc or any other colonial country as the plebiscite administrator."
    Sadiq said that the Kashmir government is actively collecting all evidence of foreign interference in Kashmir affairs, which will be announced after it has been collected.

    克什米尔制宪议会议长发表广播演说
    反对帝国主义在克什米尔的侵略阴谋
    【新华社二十八日讯】据印度报业托拉斯斯利那加讯：查谟和克什米尔制宪议会议长萨迪克八月十五日在克什米尔电台发表广播演说，揭露帝国主义战争贩子企图把克什米尔变为战争基地的阴谋。萨迪克并号召印度、巴基斯坦和克什米尔的人民一致支持反对帝国主义阴谋的斗争，使印度和巴基斯坦免受战争的蹂躏。
    萨迪克说：“我们必须记住，希望把世界投入另一次世界大战并危及世界和平的帝国主义国家，是在注意着克什米尔的。因为它的地理位置与五个大国的国家边界接壤，克什米尔有着重要的地位。这种地位引起了帝国主义战争贩子的注意。这些国家对我们的卑鄙意图的性质，已从它们在联合国中的态度上暴露无遗。它们在克什米尔河谷的行为促成了我们反对它们的态度”。
    说到最近该邦所发生的事情，他说：“这是帝国主义国家阴谋的结果，这些国家在煽动教族主义和分裂。克什米尔最近成立了一个新政府，因为在旧政府中的某些人员受到这些国家的操纵，这些国家要想把克什米尔变成一个战争基地来危害世界和平。”
    最后，萨迪克说：“在这种场合下，我们已再一次作出坚决的决定：我们将不让我们的烈士白白的牺牲。我们决不让帝国主义在我们的国家里获得一个立足点。我们将挫败他们的恶毒阴谋。”
    【新华社二十四日讯】孟买消息：克什米尔制宪议会议长萨迪克二十一日在孟买发表谈话，欢迎印度总理尼赫鲁和巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里最近在德里举行的会谈。他说，尼赫鲁和阿里间的协议适合克什米尔人民多年来极力争取实现的某些要求。萨迪克解释这些要求说：“我们反对任命美国海军上将尼米兹为公民投票行政官。我们也不愿指派英美集团或任何其他殖民国家的任何人为公民投票行政官。”
    萨迪克说，克什米尔政府正积极收集关于外国干涉克什米尔事务的一切证据，收集完毕后将加以宣布。
