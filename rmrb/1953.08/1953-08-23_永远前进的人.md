A Man Who Always Moves Forward
Jiang Ziwan

　　It was late at night. The entire factory was silent, and heavy snoring drifted from the rows of dormitories. At this time, only one dormitory at the south end of the corridor shone with a bright light as usual.

　　This was the most familiar room in this factory—the local state-owned Qinghe United Factory. On the front wall of the room hung a gold-framed portrait of Chairman Mao, with the words "Presented by the Beijing Municipal Model Representative Conference for Supporting the Military" written in the lower left corner. A small desk was placed close to the window, and the owner of the room was leaning on the desk, absorbed in thought. Who knew what he was doing? He had drawn many lines, horizontal and vertical, on the glass plate, and was holding an ink box, turning it over and pushing it back and forth along the lines on the glass plate. He would stand up for a while, then sit down again, sometimes a cheerful smile would appear on his face, and sometimes he would frown and think seriously. Who was he? He was Yao Maolin, the head of the chemical plant of this united factory and a well-known revolutionary disabled soldier model in Beijing. He was only thirty-two years old this year.

　　"Comrade Lao Yao, why aren't you resting yet? It's almost twelve o'clock! You've been staying up later and later recently. You can't keep doing this! Your health..." A person walked in from outside, patting his back with a look of extreme concern. This was our factory director, Comrade Liu Zhongwen.

　　Yao Maolin's spirit was concentrated on his thinking and he didn't see the factory director come in. He was taken aback, and then replied, "I'm thinking about a problem. Sit down, Director!" After speaking, he put the ink box back in its original place.

　　"Did you get a letter from home?"

　　"No."

　　"Is your wound acting up again?"

　　"Director, I'm thinking about that soap-cutting machine. Are we just going to waste more than three million yuan?" A deep sense of responsibility was dominating him, and he seemed not to have heard the director's last sentence.

　　It turned out that a few days ago, the factory had spent more than three million yuan to buy some materials, and the ironworkers' group had made a new-style slicing machine, but it couldn't be used. As soon as the soap bar was pushed up, the steel strip (blade) would break. Because of this, he felt like a thousand-pound stone was pressing on his heart, and he couldn't sleep for several nights. He kept thinking: How can I prevent the steel strip from breaking? Just now he was comparing the lines drawn on the glass plate to the steel strip, and the ink box to the soap bar, to study this principle.

　　"If you flatten the soap bar before pushing it, the steel strip can be shortened, and the force it bears will be smaller, so the steel strip won't break. But the original frame will have to be greatly dismantled and modified, and it might cost a lot of money again!" He told the director the principle he had researched, and the director encouraged him, saying, "As long as it can improve work efficiency, you can do it boldly!"

　　Night after night of research, repeated revisions and planning, more and more difficulties arose. His scientific knowledge was insufficient, the research tools were crude, and his wound was acting up, with bursts of pain like stabs from a knife.... But Lao Yao's enthusiasm grew stronger and stronger, and he finally worked with everyone to successfully modify the machine. The modified machine not only prevented the steel strip from breaking and eliminated debris, but also improved work efficiency. Using the old machine in the past, it took nine people two hours to cut a batch of soap (one hundred and fifty boxes), but now, with the preliminary use of this new machine, it only takes five people thirty minutes to cut a batch of soap, which is a 6.2-fold increase in work efficiency compared to the past. It is expected that when the operation becomes more proficient in the future, it can be increased to more than ten times. He was extremely happy, even though his wound was getting worse and worse!

　　Speaking of his wound, I seemed to have been kept in the dark before, unable to figure out the details. Once, at a meeting in the factory headquarters, I saw him go out for a while and then out again, five or six times in less than two hours. I was a little strange, but I didn't say anything. After the meeting, I asked him, "Lao Yao! Why did you keep running out during the meeting?" He said shyly, "I have a problem with my urination." As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to leave, but I grabbed him and asked again, "Tell me what's going on?" "After a long time, urine will flow out of my anus, and the wound will also become inflamed. I have to run out a few times!" He said with a smile and left embarrassedly.

　　At that time, I felt a little sad. We had been working together for almost half a year, and I only knew that he was a revolutionary disabled soldier, kind and sincere to others, serious and responsible in his work, and diligently studying his profession, but I had never asked about his injury, let alone known that his wound was so serious. Later, I gradually began to pay attention to him, seeing him go to urinate at least forty or fifty times a day. Sometimes, when the wound became inflamed and the pain was unbearable, he was forced to lie in bed and rest. In this situation, the leadership would ask him to take a rest. But his illness was chronic, and as soon as he felt a little better, he would ask to resume work. He often said, "Work is rest."

　　Later, I found in his file that he was wounded in the Yangshan battle in Shandong in 1947. The bullet entered from under the root of his urethra, pierced through the ureter and large intestine, and came out from above the anus, resulting in a first-class disability. Although he had undergone long-term treatment, the wound would recur with overwork.

　　Despite the frequent recurrence of his wound and the heavy workload, his entire life was permeated with revolutionary optimism. He knew how to work and how to rest. He routinely did morning exercises every day, and on Sundays he went boating, watched plays, and strolled in the park. During his daily rest, you could often hear the beautiful melodies of "Midnight Serenade" coming from his room, which was his favorite tune to play on the koto.

　　Comrade Yao Maolin was a talkative and cheerful person, and as soon as it was time to get off work, he would tell us stories. Once, he talked about the rice paddies in his hometown (Hubei Province), how to transplant rice seedlings, weed the rice... all the way to the harvest. He spoke so vividly that it was as if the rice paddies were right in front of us. The most interesting thing was when he talked about digging for loach in the rice paddies. He said, gesticulating, "...you reach your hand into the mud, and a slippery, lively little fellow comes out, so long!" He made his comrades laugh, and he laughed heartily himself. But when he talked about how he used to herd cattle and carry long-term labor for the landlords, his face immediately became serious, and he began to talk about how the landlords exploited and oppressed the peasants in the old society.

　　When he was first assigned here to lead production, he realized: "To be a leading cadre, you must be proficient in your profession and understand technology in order to do a good job of the tasks assigned by the Party and the people." But he had only studied for two years, and although he had worked hard and practiced hard, he could already write simple summary reports, but making soap required understanding chemical principles and science and technology. When he watched the technicians do tests, they would talk about so many "meters" and so many "degrees," and he couldn't understand any of it. At this time, the task before him was like a big stone pressing on him. He couldn't sleep at night and thought: "Chiang Kai-shek's eight million 'American-style' troops were defeated by our 'rifles plus millet', I don't believe I can't learn to make soap. I'll dedicate three years to it, and I'll definitely learn it!" His iron will made him work selflessly.

　　Whenever the technicians did tests, he would always watch intently, thinking in his mind: Why is he doing this? For example: Beijing oil is of poorer quality, what is its freezing point? Hankou oil is of better quality, what is its freezing point? How much caustic soda is needed for which kind of oil? ...He would ask about these technical problems if he didn't know, and he would write them down in his diary little by little. Day after day, month after month, in less than half a year, his diary became almost a "complete guide to soap making."

　　In June and July of last year, due to seasonal factors, the finished products produced were soft and mottled, and the quality was very poor. At one point, the rework rate averaged over 80%. According to the old saying, rework was unavoidable when making soap in the summer. The technicians didn't have a good solution either. At this time, Comrade Yao Maolin thought: "If this problem is not solved, it will not only affect the factory's reputation, but also increase costs and cause losses to the state. I must find a way to solve this problem!" In those days, he didn't tell us stories, and he left his koto aside. Due to overwork, he had to urinate even more frequently. The leadership and his comrades advised him to rest well and not to overwork himself. He always replied with a smile: "Just let me have some peace and quiet." At night, he lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, pondering: "Soap is soft, probably because of moisture. For example, when cooking rice, if there is too little water, it will be hard in the center, and if there is too much water, it will become porridge. Rice boiled in the original soup is delicious. Right! It must be because of the moisture..." He smiled as if a child had received his favorite thing.

　　The next day, when he told the technician about it, the technician didn't believe it, and some even gossiped behind his back: "He hasn't studied chemistry, but he wants to make soap, what a joke!" "Even if he studies for another three years, he won't succeed!"... But he didn't lose heart at all. He patiently discussed with the technician: "Let's try it and see!" The results of the experiment proved that it was indeed because of the moisture and the excessive amount of caustic soda. After this improvement, by last winter, the rework rate had been reduced to 5%.

　　In this way, in less than half a year, he not only mastered the technology of making soap skillfully, but also saved more than 100 catties of caustic soda and more than 30 catties of salt per batch of soap compared to the past, and the quality was also improved. Each year, he could save the state 30 million yuan in wealth and 1,720 work hours.

　　Last October, when the technicians all participated in the Beijing Municipal Materials Exchange Conference, he was the only one at home who mastered the technology, so he personally made more than 20 batches of soap, and the quality was very good. His confidence was even stronger. Sometimes he had to work overtime until 3 a.m., but the next day he got up earlier than anyone else and called the comrades up so that they could participate in the Materials Exchange Conference earlier.

　　Once, when I was chatting with him, I asked him, "How did you learn this technology?" Without thinking, he said, "At first, I didn't understand anything, and I didn't dare to start, but I'm a Communist Party member!" His attitude changed from a smile to seriousness. "The superiors often say: 'Things are different now than in the past. Even a small slip of paper two fingers wide can be used as an official document. If you don't understand, you have to dig into it. It's okay if you don't understand today, but it's not okay if you don't understand tomorrow!' So, I try hard to dig in! Don't you think so?" Before I could answer, he continued, "It's too ordinary. Look at Huang Jiguang and Qiu Shaoyun, they are the real heroes! To be honest, if it weren't for this wound, I would have asked to go to Korea!"

　　"An ordinary person," yes, he is an ordinary person, but he is doing extraordinary things!

　　In the factory's performance evaluation in 1951, he was awarded a second-class merit. In 1952, he was named "Model Worker." In 1953, at the Beijing Municipal Model Representative Conference for Supporting the Military, he was also named "Revolutionary Disabled Soldier Model."

　　In his diary, he wrote: "Although my body is disabled and I can't do too much work, my mind is not disabled. I will always maintain the lofty honor given to me by the people, humbly learn from my comrades under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and do more work for the people!"

    永远前进的人
    蒋子万
    夜深了。整个工厂一片寂静，从一排排的宿舍里，不时地传出沉重的鼾声。这时只有走廊南头的一间宿舍，照例地又射出一派透亮的灯光。
    这是在这个工厂里——地方国营清河联合工厂，大家最熟悉的屋子。屋子的正面墙上挂着镶了金边的毛主席的挂像，挂像的左下角写着：“北京市优抚模范代表大会敬赠”的字样。紧靠窗户放着一个小办公桌，屋子的主人在倚着桌子聚精会神地捉摸着什么。谁知道他在做什么呢？在玻璃板上横三竖四地划了很多道儿，手里拿着墨盒，反过来，调过去，把墨盒来回地顺着玻璃板上的道儿推。他一会儿站起来，一会儿又坐下去，一会儿脸上出现了开朗的笑容，一会又紧皱着眉头严肃地思索起来。他是谁呢？他就是这个联合工厂的化工厂负责人，北京市闻名的革命荣誉军人模范姚茂林同志。他今年才三十二岁。
    “老姚同志，怎么还不休息，快十二点啦？你近来越发睡得晚了，这样经常熬夜可不行！你的身体……。”一个人从外面走进来，脸上带着极度关注的神情用手拍着他的背问了问。这是我们的厂长刘忠文同志。
    姚茂林的精神都贯注在思考上，没有看到厂长进来。于是愣了愣，回答说：“我正在考虑一个问题。坐下吧，厂长！”说完把墨盒放回原来的位置。
    “家里来信了吗？”
    “没有。”
    “伤口又犯了？”
    “厂长，我是想那个切肥皂的切片机。难道厂子里就白化三百多万吗？”一种深刻的责任感在支配着他，厂长的最后一句话，他好像没有听见似的。
    原来前些日子，工厂里化了三百多万元买了些材料，由铁工组做了一架新式的切片机，结果不能使用。肥皂块子往上一推，钢条（刀刃）就断。为了这，他心里像压上了千斤石一样，好几宿睡不着觉。他老是想：怎么才能使钢条不断呢？刚才他就是把玻璃板上划的道儿比做钢条，墨盒当肥皂块子，在研究这个道理。
    “要是把肥皂块子放扁了推，钢条可以缩短，它吃的力量也小啦，钢条就可以不断。但是原来的架子就要大拆大改，说不定又要化多少钱！”他把自己研究的道理告诉厂长，厂长鼓励他说：“只要能提高工作效率，你就大胆地做吧！”
    一夜一夜地钻研，三番五次地修改、筹划，困难越来越多。科学知识不够，研究的工具又粗糙，伤口也犯了起来，阵阵的疼痛像刀扎一般……。可是老姚的劲头却越来越大，终于和大家一起把机器修改成功了。修改后的机器不但钢条不断，消除了碎渣，工作效率也提高了。使用过去的老机器，一锅肥皂（一百五十箱）九个人要切两小时，现在初步使用了这部新机器，一锅肥皂五个人只需要三十分钟就行了，较过去的工作效率提高了六点二倍，预料将来操作熟练了，可以提高到十倍以上。他高兴得不得了，虽然伤口却愈来愈重了！
    说起他的伤口来，以前我好像蒙在鼓里一样，摸不清底细。有一次在厂部开会，我看他一会出去一趟，一会又出去一趟，不到两小时他就出去了五六趟。我心里有点奇怪，可是也没吭声。散会后，我问他：“老姚！你怎么开会时老往外跑啊？”他腼腆地说：“我的小便有毛病。”他刚说完就要走，我一把拉住他，又追问：“你再说说怎么回事？”“时间一长，尿就要从肛门流出来，伤口也要发炎，不多跑两趟不行！”他说完了笑了笑，不好意思地走了。
    当时我心里有点难过。我们在一起工作快半年了，只知道他是个革命荣誉军人，待人和蔼诚恳，工作认真负责，苦心钻研业务，可一向也没问问他的受伤情形，更不知道他的伤口还有这么重。后来我渐渐地对他注意起来，看他每天最少要去小便四、五十次。有时伤口发了炎，疼的实在忍不住，才被迫地躺在床上歇一歇。碰到这种情形，领导上就叫他去休养。可是他的病是慢性的，稍好一些，他就要求恢复工作。他常说：“工作就是休息。”
    后来我从档案里发现，他是一九四七年在山东阳山战斗中负的伤。子弹从他小便根底下打进去，穿过输尿管和大肠，又从肛门上面穿出来，成了一等残废。虽然经过长期治疗，可是一劳累过度，伤口就又复发了。
    尽管伤口经常犯，工作很繁重，可是他的整个生活里渗透着革命的乐观主义。他会工作，也会休息。每天照例上早操，星期天他也去划船、看戏、逛公园。在日常休息时，你经常会听到从他的屋子里传出来的“夜深沉”的优美歌曲声，这是他最喜欢弹奏的大正琴的声音。
    姚茂林同志是个爱说爱笑的人，一到下班时，就给我们讲故事听。有一次讲到他老家（湖北省）的稻田，如何插秧、薅稻……一直到丰收。他讲得是那样逼真，就像稻田在我们眼前一样。最有趣的，是他讲到在稻田里挖泥鳅的情景。他一边说，一边比手划脚地：“……你把手往泥里一掏呀，嗞溜的一条，活蹦乱跳的滑溜溜的家伙就出来了，那么长！”逗得同志们大笑，他也哈哈地笑个不停。但是一讲到他过去给地主放牛、扛长工时，他的脸上马上严肃起来，又讲起在旧社会地主如何剥削和压迫农民的事来了。
    他一开始被派到这里领导生产时，就认识到：“做一个领导干部，必须精通业务，懂得技术，才能把党和人民交给的任务搞好。”可是自己一共才念了两年书，虽然经过苦学苦练，已经能写简单的总结报告，但是制肥皂是需要懂得化学原理和科学技术的，他看着技师做化验时，一讲就是什么多少
    “米特儿”，多少“度”的，简直一点也听不懂。这时，摆在他面前的任务就像一块大石头似的压在他的身上。他黑夜睡不着觉就想：“蒋介石的八百万
    ‘美国式’，都让我们‘步枪加小米’给打垮啦，我就不信学不会制肥皂。我豁出他三年去，非学会不可！”钢铁般的意志，使他忘我地工作着。
    每当技师做化验时，他老是在一旁目不转睛地看，脑子在想：为什么他要这样做？比如：北京的油，质量差些，凝结多少度？汉口的油，质量好些，凝结多少度？那一种油需要下多少火碱才合适？……这些技术问题，他不知道就问，问明白了，就一点一滴地记在自己的日记本子上。天天如此，日积月累地不到半年，他的日记本子快成了“制肥皂大全”啦。
    去年六、七月间，由于季节的关系，制出的成品，又松软，又有花斑，质量很差。一度，反工率曾平均在百分之八十以上。按照老一套的说法，夏季制肥皂回锅是免不了的。技师也没有好办法解决。这时，姚茂林同志想：“如果不解决这问题，不但会影响工厂的信誉，而且要提高成本，给国家造成损失。非想出办法解决这个问题不行！”那几天，他没有给我们讲故事，大正琴也扔在一边啦。由于工作过度紧张，小便越发勤了。领导上劝他，同志们也劝他，要他好好休息一下，不要积劳过度。他总是面带微笑地回答：“叫我清静一会就好啦。”夜里他躺在床上，眼睛凝视着房顶，沉思着：肥皂松软，可能是水分的关系。譬如煮大米饭，水少了就有硬心儿，水多了就成粥啦，原汤煮熟了就好吃。对！一定是水分的关系……”他好像孩子得到了自己心爱的东西似的，笑了。
    第二天他跟技师一说，技师还不相信，有的甚至在背地说风凉话：“没学过化学，就想做肥皂，真是笑话！”“叫他再学三年，也不成！”……可是他一点也没灰心。耐心地跟技师商量：“行不行，咱们试试看！”试验的结果，证明就是因为水分和火碱下的过量的关系。经过这次改良，到去年冬，反工率已经降低到百分之五了。
    这样，不到半年功夫，他不但熟练地掌握了制肥皂的技术，而且每锅肥皂较过去可以节省一百多斤火碱，三十多斤盐，质量也提高了。每年可给国家节省三千万元的财富和一千七百二十个工时。
    去年十月，技师们都参加了北京市的物资交流大会，家里只剩了他一个人掌握技术，他便亲自动手，做了二十多锅肥皂，质量都很好。他的信心更加强了。有时一加班，就得夜里三点钟才能睡觉，但第二天他比谁都起的早，把同志们都叫起来，好早一点去参加物资交流大会。
    有一次，我跟他聊天，我问他：“你这技术怎么学的？”他没有想，顺口就说：“开始时，咱根本就不懂，也不敢下手，可是自己是个共产党员！”他的态度由微笑转为严肃。“上级经常说：‘现在不比过去啦，二指宽的小纸条儿，也可以当公文，不懂就得钻进去，今天不懂可以，明天不懂就不行！’咱就努力钻呗！你说是不是？”我还没来得及答话，他就又接下去：“太平凡了。看看人家黄继光和邱少云，才是真正的英雄呢！老实说，要不是这伤口闹的，我非要求上朝鲜去不可！”
    “一个平凡的人”，是的，他是一个平凡的人，可是他却做着不平凡的事！
    一九五一年工厂考绩时，他立了二等功。一九五二年被评为“工作模范”。一九五三年，在北京市的优抚模范代表大会上，又被评为“革命荣誉军人模范”。
    在他的日记本上这样写着：“我的身体虽然残废了，做不了太多的工作，但是，我的思想并没有残废，我要永远保持着人民给我的崇高荣誉，在党和毛主席的领导下，虚心地向同志们学习，好为人民做更多的工作！”（附图片）
