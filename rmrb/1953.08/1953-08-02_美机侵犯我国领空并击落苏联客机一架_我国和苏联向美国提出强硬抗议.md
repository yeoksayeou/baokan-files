Xinhua News Agency, August 1st:
    Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on the Crime of the U.S. Air Force's Intrusion into Our Airspace and Attack on a Soviet Passenger Plane:
    According to verified reports obtained by our government, on July 27, 1953, U.S. military aircraft intruded into our Northeast airspace in successive waves, totaling 53 batches and 324 sorties. Among them, 15 batches and 78 sorties penetrated deep into areas of Liaodong Province, including Benxi, Gaiping, Anshan, Haicheng, Tonghua, and Liuhe, Jilin Province, including Huadian, Changchun, and Gongzhuling, and areas south of Shenyang in Liaoxi Province, for reconnaissance activities.
    Among the aforementioned intruding U.S. aircraft, a group of four F-86s intruded into our territory from the Linjiang area at 11:12 on the same day, flew to the airspace above Huadian at 11:19 for reconnaissance, and left at 11:28. During the intrusion, this group of aircraft also attacked and shot down a Soviet Il-12 passenger plane flying on a regular route from Dalian to the Soviet Union, resulting in the death of 21 people on board.
    Since the outbreak of the Korean War, U.S. warmongers, in an attempt to expand the Korean War and further undermine peace in the Far East, have repeatedly ordered their air force to intrude into our airspace and carry out despicable provocations against our country. The number of sorties of U.S. aircraft intruding into our airspace this time, and the extent of the invaded areas, have reached the highest record in more than three years. The bandit-like attack on a Soviet passenger plane is the most serious provocative crime against the people of China and the Soviet Union. The Chinese people express great anger at this.
    The U.S. military authorities deliberately chose the day the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed to carry out such a serious provocative action of invading our airspace, which proves that the U.S. warmongers are not reconciled to their failure in Korea. The Chinese people are constantly on high alert and stepping up their preparedness for any possible aggressive and adventurous actions from the U.S. war forces.
    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China hereby lodges a strong protest against the crime of the U.S. Air Force's aggression against Chinese airspace and the attack on a Soviet passenger plane, and solemnly declares that the U.S. government must bear full responsibility for this aggressive crime.

Fifteen passengers and six flight crew members died in the downed plane.
    The Soviet Government lodges a firm protest regarding this bandit-like attack on a Soviet passenger plane by American military aircraft in the airspace of the People's Republic of China, and hopes that the American Government will take measures to severely punish those responsible for this attack, and prevent the recurrence of such criminal actions by the American military authorities in the future.

    美机侵犯我国领空并击落苏联客机一架
    我国和苏联向美国提出强硬抗议
    【新华社一日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部关于美国空军侵犯我国领空并袭击苏联客机的罪行的抗议声明：
    根据我国政府所得的经过核实的报告，一九五三年七月二十七日，美国军用飞机先后侵入我东北领空窜扰，共达五十三批、三百二十四架次之多，其中十五批、七十八架次曾分别深入到我辽东省的本溪、盖平、鞍山、海城、通化、柳河一带，吉林省的桦甸、长春、公主岭一带，和辽西省沈阳以南地区，进行侦察活动。
    在上述入侵的美机中，有一批F—86四架，于同日十一时十二分由临江地区侵入我国境，十一时十九分飞到桦甸一带上空侦察窜扰，至十一时二十八分始行离去；该批飞机在窜扰中并曾袭击和击落我友邦苏联的一架正在旅大到苏联的正规航线上飞行的伊尔十二式客机，机上人员二十一名死难。
    自朝鲜战争发生以来，美国好战分子为了妄图扩大朝鲜战争，进一步破坏远东和平，曾经多次命令其空军侵犯我国领空，对我国进行卑鄙挑衅。这次美机入侵我国领空的架次之多，侵犯地区之广，达到了三年多来的最高记录，并对我友邦苏联客机进行强盗式的袭击，这是对于中苏两国人民一次最严重的挑衅罪行。中国人民对此，表示极大愤怒。
    美国军事当局故意选择了朝鲜停战协定签字的这一天，来进行这样严重的侵犯我国领空的挑衅行动，这就证明美国好战分子们是不甘心于他们在朝鲜的失败的。中国人民对于来自美国战争势力方面的任何可能的侵略行动和冒险行动，都在时刻提高警惕，加紧戒备。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府兹特对于美国空军所犯的侵略中国领空和袭击苏联客机的罪行提出强硬抗议，并且郑重声明，美国政府对于这种侵略罪行，必须承担全部责任。
    一九五三年八月一日于北京【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日电：苏联外交部副部长亚·葛罗米柯在七月三十一日接见美国驻苏联大使查·波伦，并向他递交下列照会：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府认为有必要向美利坚合众国政府发表下列声明：
    根据苏联主管当局的已经核实的报告，今年七月二十七日莫斯科时间六点二十八分，侵入中华人民共和国领空的四架美国战斗机，在距中朝边界一百一十公里处的桦甸附近，袭击并击落了一架正在旅顺口到苏联的正规航线上飞行的苏联伊尔十二式客机。在被击落的飞机上，十五个乘客和六个飞行人员死难。
    苏联政府坚决抗议美国军用飞机在中华人民共和国领空对一架苏联客机进行的这种强盗式的袭击，并希望美国政府采取措施，严惩应对这次袭击负责的人员，并防止美国军事当局的这种罪恶行动在今后发生。
    苏联政府保留就上述二十一个苏联公民的死亡和飞机的损失向美国政府要求赔偿的权利。”
    查·波伦先生说，他将把上述照会转交给美国政府。
