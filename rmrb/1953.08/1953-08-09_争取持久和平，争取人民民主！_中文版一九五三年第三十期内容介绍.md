The organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, 1953, Issue 30, has been published.

This issue publishes in full the communique of the Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on the results of the implementation of the plan for the development of the Soviet national economy in the first half of 1953. Under the title "The Economy and Culture of People's Democratic Countries Are Constantly Rising," it publishes news about Poland, Hungary, and Romania completing their production plans for the first half of this year or the second quarter. This issue also publishes an editorial entitled "New Economic Achievements of the Countries of the Peace, Democracy, and Socialism Camp." The editorial points out that the results of the implementation of the plan for the development of the Soviet national economy in the first half of 1953 once again prove that the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union have the firm will to fully implement the instructions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the Fifth Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union. The steady progress of the Soviet national economy and culture proves that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee have indeed ensured uninterrupted and correct leadership of the country, and proves that the imperialist reactionaries' delusions of weakening the Soviet Union have been completely defeated. The recent economic achievements of the Soviet Union vividly demonstrate the peaceful intentions of the Soviet national economy. The Soviet Union's peace policy has aroused the ever-increasing upsurge of the peace movement throughout the world. At the same time, the Soviet Union's peaceful economic construction and cultural development have greatly promoted the further consolidation and expansion of cooperation among the countries of the socialist camp. The capacity of the world democratic market is expanding day by day. The facts and figures reflecting the victories of Soviet communist construction and the glorious labor of the people's democratic countries are powerful mobilizing weapons for the communist and workers' parties of all countries. To fully use this weapon, to make everyone aware of the true situation of the growing prosperity of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, is the major responsibility of every communist, all communist and democratic newspapers, and all progressive organizations in all countries.

Under the title "The Ninth Anniversary of the Liberation of Poland by the Soviet Army," this issue publishes in full the report of Bolesław Bierut, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic, at the meeting of the Warsaw People's Council celebrating the National Rebirth Day on July 21. This report details the course and achievements of the Polish people in building a new Poland in the nine years after being liberated with the help of the great Soviet army. The report also pointed out the main economic tasks of the Polish people in industry and agriculture in the recent period, and called on the people of the whole country to heighten their vigilance and thwart the sinister schemes of the enemies of peace.

Under the title "Our Party is Unprecedentedly United and Consolidated," this issue publishes excerpts from the report of Mátyás Rákosi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, at the meeting of activists of the Budapest Party Organization of the Hungarian Working People's Party on July 11. Based on the decision of the Central Committee meeting of the Working People's Party at the end of June, this report criticized the mistakes that had occurred in Hungary's industrial and agricultural construction, described the various measures formulated by the Party Central Committee to correct these errors, and pointed out that these measures had already received enthusiastic response from the people. The report also talked about the recent reorganization and simplification of the leadership institutions and Council of Ministers of the Hungarian Working People's Party. He pointed out that this reorganization of the Party's leadership institutions accelerated the pace of the Party's political work and unified the Party's political work. The simplification of the organizational structure of the Council of Ministers was also to accelerate the work of government departments. As for the positions of Secretary of the Party Central Committee and Chairman of the Council of Ministers being shared by two comrades, this is because the responsibilities of both positions are so great that each position requires the full strength and talent of a comrade. Rákosi's report emphasized that our party and the party's leadership institutions are unprecedentedly unified and consolidated. Because our country's friendly relations with the people's democratic countries and with the powerful Soviet Union are becoming deeper and deeper, our strength and our unity are also becoming stronger and stronger. We must learn from past mistakes and carry out socialist construction in a better way.

Other articles published in this issue include: "The Right-Wing Leaders of the Austrian Socialist Party - Defenders of American Policy" by Friedl Fürnberg, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Austria; "Party Supervision of Enterprises" by O. Hranova, Secretary of the Communist Party Organization of the "September 9th" Tannery in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria; and "The Bolivian People Continue to Struggle for National Independence" by A. P.

Hranova's article introduces the experience of the Communist Party Committee of the "September 9th" Tannery in Sofia in supervising the factory's production work. The article points out that the strength of the party's supervision lies in combining supervision work with mass political work. The important task of the Party Committee is to make the Party's supervision more effective, to make every Party member deeply concerned about the factory's work, to study the factory's economy, to never compromise on shortcomings, and to mobilize all workers to strive to become work models through selfless labor and mobilization work.

A. P.'s article is a letter from La Paz, the capital of the Republic of Bolivia. The letter points out that the Bolivian people launched an armed uprising on April 9, 1952, overthrowing the dictatorial government directed by American monopoly capitalists and handing over power to the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement Party headed by Paz Estenssoro (the current president). Under the demands and pressure of the people, the new government nationalized the mines of the three major companies that controlled 80% of the country's tin exports, which were originally in the hands of foreign monopoly capitalists, and established a system of state monopoly of mineral exports. The broad masses of the people have gained democratic rights. However, the government of the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement Party has not seriously implemented the party's platform of implementing the nationalization of mines and land reform, and is increasingly colluding with foreign monopoly capitalists, and is doing its utmost to prevent the people's masses, headed by the working class, from continuing the democratic reforms that began on April 9th last year. In this situation, the Communist Party of Bolivia calls for the establishment of a broad national liberation patriotic front based on the worker-peasant alliance to struggle for the realization of a program of national independence, democratic freedom and peace.

    本期全文刊载了苏联部长会议中央统计局关于一九五三年上半年发展苏联国民经济计划执行结果的公报，并在“人民民主国家的经济和文化不断上升”的标题下，刊载了波兰、匈牙利和罗马尼亚完成今年上半年或第二季度生产计划的消息。本期并以“和平、民主和社会主义阵营国家新的经济成就”为题发表社论。社论指出，一九五三年上半年发展苏联国民经济计划执行的结果，再一次证明了苏联各族人民具有坚定的意志，来全部实现苏联共产党第十九次代表大会关于苏联第五个五年计划的指示。苏联国民经济和文化的稳步前进，证明苏联共产党及其中央委员会已确使国家得到不间断的和正确的领导，证明帝国主义反动派所怀抱的削弱苏联的妄想，已经遭到了完全的失败。苏联最近的经济成就，生动地证明了苏联国民经济的和平意向。苏联的和平政策引起了全世界和平运动的日益高涨。同时，苏联的和平经济建设和文化发展，大大地促进了社会主义阵营各国的合作的进一步巩固和扩大。世界民主市场的容量日益扩大了。反映苏联共产主义建设和人民民主国家的光荣劳动的胜利的事实和数字，是各国共产党和工人党的具有强大动员力量的武器。充分地使用这件武器，使所有的人都知道苏联和人民民主国家日益繁荣的真实情况，是每一个共产主义者、所有的共产主义的和民主的报刊以及各国一切进步团体的重大责任。
    本期在“苏军解放波兰九周年”的题目下，全文刊载了波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席、波兰人民共和国部长会议主席波·贝鲁特七月二十一日在华沙市人民议会庆祝国家复兴节的大会上的报告。这个报告详细地叙述了波兰人民在伟大苏联军队的援助下获得解放后，九年来建设新波兰的经过和成就。报告中还指出了波兰人民最近时期在工业和农业方面的主要经济任务，并号召全国人民提高警惕，挫败和平敌人的罪恶阴谋。
    本期在“我们党是空前地团结和巩固起来了”的题目下，摘要刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会书记马加斯·拉科西七月十一日在匈牙利劳动人民党布达佩斯党组织活动分子会议上的报告。这个报告根据六月底劳动人民党中央委员会会议的决定，批判了在匈牙利工农业建设中曾经发生的错误，叙述了党中央委员会为纠正这些错误而制订的各种措施，并指出了这些措施已经在人民群众中获得热烈的反应。报告中还谈到了匈牙利劳动人民党的领导机构和部长会议最近实行改组和简化的情况，他指出，党的领导机构的这次改组，加速了党的政治工作的节奏，统一了党的政治工作。部长会议组织机构的简化也是为了加速政府部门的工作。至于党中央委员会书记和部长会议主席的职务由两位同志分担，这是因为两个职务的责任都是那样重大，每一个职务都需要一位同志的全部力量和才能。拉科西的报告强调说：我们的党和党的领导机构是空前地统一和巩固了。由于我国与人民民主国家、与强大的苏联的友好关系越来越深厚，我们的力量和我们的统一也越来越坚强了。我们要从过去的错误中吸取教训，以更好的方式来进行社会主义建设。
    本期刊载的其他文章有：奥地利共产党总书记弗雷德尔·费恩柏的“奥地利社会党右翼领袖——美国政策的维护者”，保加利亚首都索非亚“九月九日”制革工厂共产党组织书记奥·赫拉诺瓦的“党对企业的监督”，阿·普的“玻利维亚人民继续为民族独立而斗争”。
    赫拉诺瓦的文章介绍了索非亚“九月九日”制革工厂的共产党委员会对该厂生产工作实行监督的经验。文章指出，党的监督力量在于把监督工作与群众政治工作结合起来。党委会的重大任务是使党的监督更加有效，使每一个党员深切地关怀工厂工作，研究工厂的经济，对于缺点绝不调和，并以忘我的劳动和鼓动工作，动员所有的工人争取成为工作模范。
    阿·普的文章是一封寄自玻利维亚共和国首都拉巴斯的信。信中指出，玻利维亚人民在一九五二年四月九日发动武装暴动，推翻了美国垄断资本家指使的独裁政府，把政权交给以帕斯·艾斯顿索罗（现任总统）为首的民族主义革命运动党。在人民的要求和压力下，新的政府把原在外国垄断资本家掌握下的控制着全国锡的出口量百分之八十的三家大公司的矿山收归国有，建立了由国家垄断矿产出口的制度。广大的人民获得了民主权利。但是，民族主义革命运动党的政府，并没有认真执行该党标明实行矿山国有化和土地改革的政纲，愈来愈同外国垄断资本家联成一气，极力阻止以工人阶级为首的人民群众继续进行从去年四月九日开始的民主改革。在这种形势下，玻利维亚共产党号召成立一个以工农联盟为基础的广泛的民族解放爱国阵线，为实现一个争取民族独立、民主自由与和平的纲领而斗争。
