	State-owned Mechanized Farms in Northeast China Begin Harvesting Spring Wheat

	Currently, state-owned mechanized farms in the Northeast region have begun harvesting spring wheat.

	This year, twenty-four farms in the Northeast region have planted spring wheat, with a planting area of more than 620,000 mu, of which nineteen farms in northern Manchuria have planted as much as 600,000 mu. Because the farms have generally improved their cultivation techniques, carried out deep plowing and close planting, and strengthened field management, the germination rate of wheat is above 90%, and the growth is good, generally promising a bumper harvest. However, because northern Manchuria is located north of 45 degrees north latitude, the frost-free period is short (generally 120 to 140 days), and the annual rainfall of 500 to 600 millimeters is concentrated in July, August, and September, especially in August during the spring wheat harvest, when there is the most rain. If the harvest preparation work is not sufficient, it is easy to cause huge losses to the mature wheat, resulting in a serious phenomenon of "high yield but no harvest." During the wheat harvest in 1951, continuous cloudy and rainy weather caused some farms to abandon their wheat because they had not prepared properly and the machines could not go into the fields. In order to learn from this lesson, this year, the farms in Northeast China generally advanced the sowing period of spring wheat in order to advance the maturity period of spring wheat and shorten the harvesting time during the rainy season. After the spring sowing was completed, the leadership of each farm seized the opportunity to arrange for the repair of machines and prepare for the wheat harvest, such as preparing the wheat drying fields. From June 10th to July 10th, the Northeast State-owned Farm Administration concentrated more than 300 combine operators and opened a short-term training class for combine operators at the "93" farm. After the training class, the bureau sent four working groups to go deep into various farms to check the preparation work. In mid-July, the bureau specially held an agricultural technology conference to study specific technical issues such as spring wheat harvesting and land preparation in various farms. Based on the arrangements of the higher authorities and the actual situation of their own farms, each farm, after field investigation and mobilizing employees to discuss, formulated specific harvesting plans. At present, the machinery and equipment repair work of each factory has been completed, the materials have been prepared, the labor organization has also been adjusted, the roads and bridges that have been damaged by rain have been repaired, and at the beginning of this month, the factories have begun to harvest one after another. The employees of Erlongshan and other farms also launched a harvesting competition under the resounding slogan of "Ensure a bumper harvest." (Li Chungui)

    东北各国营机械化农场开始收割春麦
    目前东北区各国营机械化农场已开始收割春麦。
    今年东北全区播种春麦的有二十四个场，播种面积为六十二万多亩，其中北满有十九个场，播种面积即达六十万亩。由于各场普遍改进了耕作技术，进行了深耕密植，加强了田间管理，麦子的发芽率都在百分之九十以上，生长情况良好，普遍可获得丰收。但由于北满地处北纬四十五度以北，无霜期短（一般是一百二十天到一百四十天），全年五百到六百公厘的降雨量，都集中降在七、八、九三个月份，尤其是春麦收割期的八月份雨水最多，如果收割准备工作做得不充分，就容易使成熟的麦子遭到巨大损失，造成“丰产不丰收”的严重现象。一九五一年麦收时，连续阴雨，有的场就因为准备工作没做好，机器不能下地，白白把麦子扔掉了。为了接受这个教训，今年东北各场普遍提早了春麦的播种期，以便提早春麦成熟期，缩短雨季的收割时间。在春播结束后，各场领导方面，即抓紧时机布置检修机器，做好晒麦场等各项麦收准备工作。从六月十日到七月十日，东北国营农场管理局集中三百多个康拜因手，在“九三”农场开办了康拜因手的短期训练班。训练班结束后，该局又派出四个工作组，分头深入各场检查准备工作。七月中旬，该局又特地召开农业技术会议，研究各场春麦收割和土地整理等具体技术问题。各场根据上级布置及本场实际情况，经过田间调查和发动职工们讨论，都制订了具体的收割计划。现在各厂的机具检修工作已经完成，物料已准备好，劳动组织也已调整好，被雨水冲坏的道路桥梁已修补好，本月初，各场已相继开始收割。二龙山等场的职工们，并在“确保丰产又丰收”的响亮口号下，展开了收割竞赛。（李春桂）
