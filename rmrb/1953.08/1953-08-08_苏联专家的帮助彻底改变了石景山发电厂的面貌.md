    Soviet Experts' Assistance Thoroughly Changed the Face of Shijingshan Power Plant
    Cong Zhimao
    I.
    In the four years since liberation, the face of Shijingshan Power Plant has been thoroughly changed. During the enemy-puppet rule, Beijing experienced power outages every few days, and people called the power plant the "Darkness Company." Even after liberation in 1949, Beijing still had to endure "zonal power outages." In 1949, Soviet experts came to the Shijingshan Power Plant, and they patiently and responsibly studied the problems in the power plant's production. By the end of 1951, they had made more than 300 suggestions on machine equipment, technical management, and cost reduction. These suggestions allowed machines that the Japanese and Kuomintang considered old, broken, and unusable to fully unleash their potential and increase power generation capacity. In 1949, the plant's machine power generation capacity only reached 70% of its quota, while now it reaches 90%. In 1949, there were 113 serious equipment damage accidents, but in 1952 there was only one. Fuel costs in 1952 were 50% lower than in 1949; coal consumption in 1952 was 34% lower than in 1949; and the plant's own power consumption rate was 12% in 1949, but 9% in 1952. This not only guaranteed the industrial production and lighting electricity needs of the capital, but also saved 18.8 billion yuan in wealth in 1952.
    First, Soviet experts helped the Shijingshan Power Plant solve the problem of ensuring safe power supply. The first thing Soviet experts did after arriving at the plant was to oversee the repair of a certain generator, which accounted for half of the plant's power generation capacity, but had never properly generated electricity before liberation and had suffered serious damage. During the repair process, Soviet experts introduced and applied Soviet advanced maintenance technology and experience in maintenance standards. As a result, the generator reached its maximum machine output since installation. After the machine was repaired, Soviet experts personally compiled typical operating procedures for the generator and promoted the Soviet system of regular maintenance and testing, which reduced operational errors and eliminated accidents. The machine vibration problem, which had never been resolved, was also solved under the guidance of Soviet experts. In addition, the adoption of Soviet rapid repair methods and technical maintenance standards achieved the goals of "high quality, high speed, safety, and economy," ensuring a safe power supply for the capital.
    Second, another important contribution of Soviet experts to the Shijingshan Power Plant was solving the problem of improving efficiency and reducing costs. To reduce costs, it was first necessary to reduce fuel costs, which accounted for more than half of the total costs, and secondly, to save on the plant's own power consumption. In 1950, the coal consumption of the Shijingshan Power Plant was 5.4% higher than the national plan. To reduce coal consumption, it was necessary to solve the problem of coal dust leakage. The Soviet experts' proposal for sealed ventilation and improved coal grinding operations solved the problem of coal dust leakage, reducing coal dust leakage by about five tons per day, saving about 1,700 tons of coal per year. In addition, changing the proportion of steel balls and stipulating a ball addition system increased coal grinding output; and formulating a set of water treatment methods improved thermal efficiency and extended the life of the boilers. In terms of steam turbines, the use of steam extraction equipment and heaters to heat boiler water further reduced coal consumption by 3.5%, and improving vacuum would save 3,000 to 4,000 tons of coal per year. The Soviet experts' most important contribution to the Shijingshan Power Plant was in 1952 when they helped the plant learn from the Soviet experience in burning low-quality coal. Before the Shijingshan Power Plant burned low-quality coal, it burned high-quality coal with a calorific value of 6,400 calories per kilogram, but now it uses low-quality coal with a calorific value of 3,000 to 4,000 calories. As a result, fuel costs were 34% lower than the national plan. As a result of adopting advanced experience, savings in 1952 reached 18.8 billion yuan. Another aspect of reducing costs was saving self-used electricity. Under the advice of Soviet experts, a water spray pump was saved, saving 115,200 kWh per year. In addition, for example, increasing coal grinding production also relatively saved on the plant's own power consumption.
    Third, Soviet experts also made significant contributions to the equipment improvement of the Shijingshan Power Plant, tapped the potential of existing equipment, and added and improved equipment to mechanize it, thereby reducing the physical labor of workers and improving environmental sanitation. For example, after burning low-quality coal, the plant installed boiler separators according to the latest Soviet design, so that 80% of the nearly 200 tons of coal ash flying in the air every day was transported outside the plant after sedimentation. For example, the entire plant used to remove ash manually. Based on Soviet experience, water flushing ash removal equipment was installed, which solved the difficulty of ash removal work under high temperature and eliminated the serious impact of dust flying on human health and machine safety. Recently, Soviet experts have provided four solutions for improving the coal mill system, which are now being actively implemented. After adoption, coal consumption will be reduced by another 3%, saving five motors, totaling about 300 horsepower.
    Fourth, thanks to the patient assistance of Soviet experts, the theoretical and practical experience of technical personnel and the technical level of skilled workers have been improved. Soviet experts were generous and unreserved in imparting advanced Soviet experience, and they were very patient in training Chinese technical personnel. Workers described the experts as "really teaching hand-in-hand." Experts often crawled into steam turbines to tell workers things one by one; technical personnel were always afraid of wasting the experts' time when asking questions, but the experts always talked tirelessly until the person asking the question understood. With the patient help of the experts, new technical personnel and skilled workers have slowly grown up. For example, model worker Liu Dezhen was a fourth-grade worker in 1949, but now he is equivalent to a technician. In 1949, he repaired a generator with experts and learned a lot of advanced Soviet experience. In 1950, when he rushed to repair a generator, he solved the vibration problem that had not been solved for more than ten years; Tang Jiyi, a technician in the steam turbine workshop, participated in a training class to spread advanced Soviet experience, and after working with experts, he is now equivalent to an engineer; Su Yuntang, a technical personnel in the boiler workshop, had never done any design before. At the end of 1952, under the guidance of Soviet experts, he began to design complex separators and cold water walls; Yuan Kaichou, a technical personnel in the electrical workshop (now deputy director of the plant), learned the theory and technology of testing the main equipment of the electrical field with the help and guidance of experts.
    In short, the brilliant achievements of applying advanced Soviet science and technology to the Shijingshan Power Plant, as well as the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet people manifested by Soviet experts, deeply moved the technical personnel and workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant. Countless facts have proved that learning from the Soviet Union is a fundamental issue.
    II.
    The Shijingshan Power Plant Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has always regarded mobilizing the masses to implement advanced Soviet experience as the central task of the Party. In this regard, they have the following main experiences:
    1. The Party Committee attaches importance to the opinions of experts and carries out systematic publicity and education work. Advanced Soviet experience was not valued at the plant from the beginning. Initially, some cadres did not implement it seriously, skilled workers found it troublesome, and technical personnel resisted the idea. In order to solve these ideological problems, the Party Committee often helped cadres analyze the situation, explain the Party's policies, clear up their thinking, and set steps, and often used the working spirit and practical achievements of experts to educate employees. In 1952, it summarized the achievements of expert suggestions over the past three and a half years and held a large-scale exhibition, laying an ideological foundation for further learning from the Soviet Union.
    2. The Party Committee mobilizes and organizes forces to supervise the implementation of administrative cadres. In 1950, after the experts came to the plant, they put forward 209 suggestions, but most of them were not seriously implemented. Based on this situation, the Party Committee went deep into the workshops, starting with inspecting the work of the branch, and after collecting the specific situation of the implementation of expert suggestions, it convened a cadre meeting and carried out criticism and education. As a result, by the end of the year, 56% of the suggestions had been implemented, and 80% of the suggestions in the steam turbine workshop had been implemented. When burning low-quality coal in 1952, some people thought that low-quality coal could not be burned, and that it would easily extinguish the fire after burning. Technical personnel insisted that the boiler could only burn high-quality coal because the boiler was designed to burn high-quality coal. Workers also had concerns, fearing that burning low-quality coal would "not be able to produce enough steam." Under such circumstances, the Party Committee pointed out: "Burning one-thousandth or one-ten-thousandth of low-quality coal is also creating wealth for the country." At the same time, the Party Committee assigned the task of trial-burning low-quality coal to Liu Guangjin, a Party member of the key experimental class, as a political task. Because Liu Guangjin united the masses and successfully trial-burned the coal, he strengthened the leadership's confidence. In this way, the factory director personally participated in the trial-burning work, and the technical personnel also went deep into the site to help the workers summarize various advanced experiences in the trial-burning, thus solving a series of problems and making the trial-burning of low-quality coal a complete success. Relying on Party members as the backbone and mobilizing forces inside and outside the Party to conduct in-depth inspections are the main methods for implementing advanced Soviet experience.
    3. After advanced Soviet experience is adopted, the Party Committee formulates a plan to ensure its promotion, and promptly puts forward correct slogans to mobilize the masses to ensure its realization.
    The Shijingshan Power Plant has made great achievements in implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, such as ensuring safe power supply, reducing costs, and unleashing potential, but it is not enough in implementing operating procedures. In order to reduce operational errors and eliminate accidents, Soviet experts specially compiled typical operating procedures for a certain generator with high technical and economic value. The leadership has also done some work to implement this system, but it lacks specific leadership and systematic learning, so the implementation of the rules and regulations has become a formality. The Sheng Xianming team of a certain generator consciously organized the entire team to learn, so that the foreman and some workers mastered the regulations, and also created many experiences in learning the regulations. The team has not had a single major or ordinary responsibility accident in the past three years, but the leadership believes that their achievements were not achieved by implementing regulations, but only because the workers have good skills and a lot of experience, so these experiences were not summarized. As a result of the rules and regulations becoming a formality, operational errors and equipment accidents will occur in production. Of the 65 accidents that occurred in April 1953, more than 50% were caused by violations of rules and regulations. On March 12, 1953, the plant began a major safety inspection, thoroughly exposing the bureaucracy of the leadership. Many of the accidents and near-miss accidents revealed by the workers further exposed the seriousness of violating operating procedures. Through this inspection, it has been clearly recognized ideologically by the leadership that conscientiously implementing operating procedures is the key issue in current production. Therefore, the experience of the Sheng Xianming team in learning the typical operating procedures of a certain generator from Soviet experts was summarized, and it was decided to implement the operating procedures in an organized and systematic manner. The "Rules and Regulations Training Class" attended by the foreman has already started, and recently a general test has been conducted among cadres, technical personnel and the masses. The plant has listed the implementation of rules and regulations and ensuring safe power supply as a major task for the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League.
    In addition, Soviet experts criticized and made suggestions on the factory's cleaning and sanitation work as early as 1949, but they have not been seriously implemented and enforced for several years. The main reason is that the leading cadres have insufficient understanding of the cleaning and sanitation work, and feel that this is a "small matter." They have not linked the hazards of uncleanliness to production, and are accustomed to the current living environment, resulting in a very poor factory environment. At present, it has attracted the attention of the plant's leadership, and the cleaning and sanitation work is regarded as one of the tasks of the third quarter. A plan to improve cleaning and sanitation throughout the plant has begun to be formulated. A cleaning and sanitation campaign has been launched among all employees. The cleaning and sanitation work has been put on the agenda of technical management and production management.

    苏联专家的帮助彻底改变了石景山发电厂的面貌
    丛志茂
    一
    解放四年来，石景山发电厂的面貌已经彻底改观了。敌伪统治时期，北京三天两头停电，人家叫发电厂是“黑暗公司”；就是在解放后的一九四九年，北京也还是要“分区停电”。一九四九年苏联专家来到石景山发电厂，他们耐心地负责地研究发电厂生产中的问题，截至一九五一年底，共提了三百多条关于机器设备、技术管理、降低成本等方面的建议。这些建议使日本人、国民党认为又破又旧、不能再用的机器，充分地发挥了潜在力量，提高了发电能力。一九四九年该厂机器发电能力只达定额百分之七十，而现在则达百分之九十。一九四九年严重的设备损坏事故达一百一十三次，一九五二年则只有一次。燃料成本一九五二年较一九四九年降低了百分之五十；煤耗一九五二年较一九四九年降低了百分之三十四；厂用电率一九四九年为百分之十二，一九五二年则为百分之九。这就不但保证了首都的工业生产及照明用电，而且在一九五二年节约财富一百八十八亿元。
    首先，苏联专家帮助石景山发电厂解决了保证安全供电问题。苏联专家到厂以后头一件事，就是主持修复负荷占全厂发电力一半、但解放前从未正经发过电、且遭受严重破坏的某号机。在修复过程中，苏联专家介绍了并运用了苏联先进的检修技术和检修标准的经验，结果某号机达到了自安装以来从未达到的最大机器出力。机器修复后，苏联专家又亲自编制了某号机典型运行规程，推广了苏联定期检修和试验制度，减少了错误操作，消灭了事故；历来没有解决的机器震动问题，也在苏联专家的指导下得到了解决。加之采用了苏联的快速检修法和检修技术标准，达到了“质高速快”“安全经济”的目的，保证了首都的安全供电。
    其次，苏联专家对石景山发电厂的另一重要帮助，是解决了提高效率，降低成本的问题。要降低成本，首先要降低占全部成本一半以上的燃料成本，其次是节省厂用电。一九五○年，石景山发电厂煤耗较国家计划高百分之五点四。要降低煤耗就要解决跑煤粉的问题。苏联专家提出的密闭通风和改善磨煤操作使跑煤粉的问题解决了，每天少跑煤粉约五吨，一年约节省煤一千七百多吨。此外改变钢球比例，规定添球制度，增加了磨煤产量；制定了一套水处理的办法，提高了热效率，延长了锅炉寿命。汽机方面利用抽汽设备与加热器加热锅炉水，又降低煤耗百分之三点五；提高真空，每年将节省煤三、四千吨。苏联专家对石景山发电厂极重要的贡献是在一九五二年帮助该厂学习了苏联燃烧劣质煤的经验。石景山发电厂没烧劣质煤之前烧的都是每公斤含热量六千四百卡的好煤，现在则是用含热量三千卡到四千卡的劣质煤。因此燃料成本就比国家计划降低了百分之三十四。采用先进经验的结果，一九五二年节约达一百八十八亿元。降低成本的另一方面是节省自用电，在苏联专家的建议下，节省了一个喷水泵，一年省电十一万五千二百度。除此之外，例如增加磨煤产量也就相对地节省了厂用电。
    其三，苏联专家对石景山发电厂的设备改进也作了重大的帮助，发挥了现有的设备潜力，增设和改进了设备，使之走向机械化，因而减轻了职工的体力劳动，改善了环境卫生。例如烧劣质煤之后，该厂根据苏联最新设计，安装了锅炉分离器，使每天飞扬在空中的将近二百吨的煤灰有百分之八十经过沉淀后运到场外处理。又如，全厂过去是用人力除灰，根据苏联经验，安装了水冲除灰的设备，解决了高温下除灰工作的困难，消灭了灰尘飞扬对人体健康、机器安全的严重影响。最近苏联专家又提供了改进磨煤机系统的四个方案，现在正在积极的设法实现。采用后将再降低煤耗百分之三，节省马达五个，共约三百匹马力。
    其四，由于苏联专家的耐心帮助，提高了技术人员的理论和实践经验及技术工人的技术水平。苏联专家对苏联先进经验的传授是毫不吝惜毫不保留的，他们对培养中国技术人才十分耐心。工人们形容专家：“真是把着手教”。专家常常钻到汽机里，把一件件事告诉工人；技术人员问问题时总怕耽误专家时间，但是专家总是不厌其烦地谈，直到提问题的人懂了为止。在专家们的耐心帮助下，新的技术人员和技术工人慢慢地成长起来了。例如劳动模范刘德珍，一九四九年是四级工，现在则相当技师了。一九四九年他和专家一起修某号机，学习了很多苏联先进经验，一九五○年抢修某号机时就解决了十几年一直没有解决的震动问题；汽机车间技术员唐纪?参加了传播苏联先进经验的训练班，又经过和专家在一起工作，现在他已相当于工程师了；锅炉车间技术人员苏允塘过去从来没有作过设计，一九五二年底他在苏联专家的指导下，开始设计了复杂的分离器和冷水壁等；电气车间的技术人员袁开畴（现已为场副主任）在专家的帮助指导下，学会了关于电气场主要设备试验的理论和技术。
    总之，先进的苏联科学技术应用于石景山发电厂所取得的光辉成就，以及通过苏联专家所表现出来的苏联人民的伟大国际主义精神，深深感动了石景山发电厂的技术人员和工人，无数事实证明了学习苏联是一个根本的问题。
    二
    中共石景山发电厂党委一直把发动群众贯彻执行苏联先进经验的工作列为党的中心任务，在这方面，他们有如下几点主要经验：
    一、党委重视专家意见，并进行了系统的宣传教育工作。苏联先进经验在该厂并不是一开始就受到重视的，最初，有些干部不认真执行，技术工人嫌麻烦，技术人员思想抵抗。为了解决这些思想问题，党委经常帮助干部分析情况，交代党的政策，打通思想，定出步骤，并常以专家的工作精神和实际成绩在职工中进行教育。一九五二年并总结了三年半以来专家建议的成就，举办了一个大规模的展览会，对进一步学习苏联打下了思想基础。
    二、党委动员组织力量，监督行政干部执行。一九五○年专家来厂后曾提出建议二百零九条，但大部未被认真执行，党委根据这个情况，就深入车间，从检查支部工作着手，收集了执行专家建议的具体情况以后，就召开了干部会，进行了批评教育，结果到年底有百分之五十六的建议得到实现，汽机车间有百分之八十的建议被执行了。一九五二年烧劣质煤时，有人认为劣质煤不能烧，烧了以后容易灭火。技术人员硬说锅炉只能烧好煤，因为锅炉是为烧好煤而设计的。工人也有顾虑，怕烧劣质煤“顶不上汽”。党委在这种情况下，指出：“烧千分之一，万分之一劣质煤也是给国家创造了财富”，同时党委又把试烧劣质煤当作一件政治任务交给了重点试验班的党员刘光金，由于刘光金团结群众试烧成功，坚定了领导信心。这样厂长亲自参加了试烧工作，技术人员也深入现场，帮助工人总结了试烧中的各种先进经验，因而解决了一系列的问题，使试烧劣质煤的工作全部成功。依靠党员为骨干，动员党内外力量，深入检查，是贯彻苏联先进经验的主要方法。
    三、苏联先进经验被采纳后，党委订出了保证推行的计划，及时提出正确口号，动员群众保证其实现。
    石景山发电厂在执行苏联专家建议中如安全供电、降低成本、发挥潜力等均有很大成绩，但在贯彻操作规程方面则不够。苏联专家为了减少错误操作，消灭事故，曾专门编制了有高度技术性和经济性的某号机运行典型规程，领导方面对此制度的贯彻也曾作过一些工作，但缺乏具体领导和系统的学习，因而使规程制度的贯彻流于形式。某号机生咸明小组自觉地组织全组学习，使领班和部分工人掌握了规程，还创造了许多学习规程的经验，该组三年来没有发生一次重要和普通责任事故，但领导方面认为他们的成绩不是由于贯彻规程制度而取得的，只是工人技术好，经验多，因而对这些经验没有总结。规程制度流于形式的结果，生产中就要发生错误操作，产生设备事故。一九五三年四月份六十五件未遂事故中，有百分之五十以上是由于违犯规程制度造成的。一九五三年三月十二日该厂开始了安全大检查，彻底揭发了领导方面的官僚主义，工人们谈出的很多被隐瞒的事故和未遂事故中，更暴露了违犯操作规程的严重性。通过这次检查，已从领导思想上明确地认识了认真贯彻操作规程是当前生产上的关键问题，于是总结了生咸明小组学习苏联专家某号机运行典型规程学习情况的经验，并决定有组织、有系统地贯彻操作规程，现领班参加的“规程制度训练班”已开课，最近在干部、技术人员和群众中，进行了一次普遍测验。该厂已把贯彻规程制度，保证安全供电列为党、行政、工会、青年团一项主要任务。
    此外苏联专家在一九四九年就对工厂的清洁卫生工作提出过批评和建议，但几年来始终未被认真贯彻和执行，主要原因是领导干部对清洁卫生工作认识不足，觉得这是“小事情”，没有把不清洁对生产的危害联系起来，习惯于现在生活环境，以致工厂环境卫生很差。目前已引起该厂领导方面注意，把清洁卫生工作当作第三季度的工作之一，着手制定全厂清洁卫生改进计划。并已开始发动全体职工，开展清洁卫生运动。把清洁卫生工作提到了技术管理、生产管理的日程上来。
