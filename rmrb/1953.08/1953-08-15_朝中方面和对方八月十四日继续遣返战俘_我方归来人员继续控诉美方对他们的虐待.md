Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 14th: On the 14th, our side repatriated 159 non-Korean prisoners of war to the other side, including 9 wounded and sick prisoners of war, and 247 Korean prisoners of war, for a total of 406. The non-Korean prisoners of war included 84 American prisoners of war, 74 British prisoners of war, and 1 Canadian prisoner of war.

The other side repatriated 2,689 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side, including 291 wounded and sick. In addition, the other side repatriated 7 wounded and sick captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers to our side today. These were not included in yesterday's repatriation figures for today.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 13th: Today the weather was gloomy, with intermittent heavy rain. Our captured personnel returned in open trucks, the heavy rain lashing their wounds.

Amid the welcoming applause of our staff, six captured personnel of the Korean People's Army got out of the trucks and went to the tents of the Joint Red Cross team to accuse the U.S. side of their crimes of abuse. They were beaten by U.S. personnel at Busan Railway Station at 2:30 PM on the 12th of this month for singing "General Kim Il-sung's Song." One U.S. armed personnel pierced Lee Jun-seop's right arm with a bayonet, and stabbed Seo Hong-soon's forehead and Kim Kyung-soo's back of the head. In addition, three other U.S. armed personnel used barbed iron rods to injure Roh Hong-soon, Kim Gwi-tae, and Park Young-woong. Another captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, Yoon Gwi-seok, also got off the bus and shouted with his bloody mouth: "Oppose the U.S. military's abuse of prisoners of war." His injuries were also inflicted by U.S. armed personnel on the train from Busan to Munsan.

Son Gwi-eun, a captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who was carried down from a truck, was blind in both eyes, having been poisoned by a gas bomb released by the U.S. side two hours after the armistice agreement was signed.

Park Seong-dae, a captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who was carried down on a stretcher, had his abdomen pierced by the U.S. side with a bayonet in the first prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island on March 8th this year. When the sheet covering him was lifted, a section of intestine was exposed on his bloody abdomen. A captured personnel of the People's Army lay motionless on the other side's repatriation vehicle. He was so thin that he was skin and bones, and he did not even have the strength to stand. His name was Baek Le-byeong.

Zhang Jie, a captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who only had one right leg left, threw away his crutches as soon as he got out of the car and was carried into the tent by our staff. He said that his left leg was only slightly injured when he was captured, but the U.S. side did not treat it and amputated it.

At exactly 12:00 noon, when the other side's vehicle carrying the returning personnel had not yet stopped, Gui Fu, a captured personnel of the People's Army full of indignation, jumped out of the car and rushed to a U.S. major, representing 152 companions, to protest the U.S. side's atrocities of releasing poison gas on them en route from Busan to Munsan.

The number of captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning today is greatly reduced compared to the past few days, including Du Ziming and other seven captured personnel who were specially detained. They said that there are still five captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who were with them who are still being specially detained. The returning personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers said that in the 7th Reception Center in Busan, there are also captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who are being specially detained.

    朝中方面和对方八月十四日继续遣返战俘
    我方归来人员继续控诉美方对他们的虐待
    【新华社开城十四日电】十四日我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百五十九名，其中包括伤病战俘九名，朝鲜籍战俘二百四十七名，共四百零六名。非朝鲜籍战俘中包括美国籍战俘八十四名，英国籍战俘七十四名，加拿大籍战俘一名。
    对方遣送给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员二千六百八十九名，其中包括伤病者二百九十一名。另外，今天对方遣送给我方中国人民志愿军伤病被俘人员七名，这是昨天对方交来的今天遣返数字中所没有的。
    【新华社开城十三日电】今天天气阴沉，大雨时断时续，我方被俘人员乘坐敞篷的卡车归来，大雨淋着他们的伤痕。
    在我方工作人员欢迎的掌声中，六个朝鲜人民军被俘人员走下车来，然后就到联合红十字会小组的帐篷，控诉美方虐待他们的罪行。他们在本月十二日下午两点半钟，因为在釜山火车站上高唱“金日成将军之歌”，遭到了美方人员的殴打，有一个美方武装人员用刺刀刺穿了李俊燮的右膀，刺破了徐洪顺的前额和金镜秀的后脑。另外还有三个美方武装人员用带刺的铁棍打伤了卢洪顺、金贵泰和朴英雄。另外一个朝鲜人民军被俘人员尹贵石下车后也用流着鲜血的嘴高呼：“反对美军虐待战俘”，他的伤处也是在从釜山到汶山的火车上被美方武装人员刺破的。
    从一辆卡车上背下来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员孙贵恩，两眼已经失明，这是在停战协定签字后两小时被美方施放的毒气弹熏坏的。
    躺在担架上被抬下来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员朴声代，今年三月八日在巨济岛第一战俘营被美方用刺刀刺破了腹部。掀开覆在他身上的被单，还有一截肠子头露在带着鲜血的肚皮上。一位人民军被俘人员丝毫不动地躺在对方的遣送车上，他瘦得皮包骨头，连站立的力气也没有了。他的名字是白勒炳。
    只剩下一条右腿的志愿军被俘人员张杰，刚跳下汽车就扔掉了拐杖，被我方工作人员背进帐篷。他说：他的左腿在被俘时只受了轻伤，美方不予治疗就把这条腿锯掉了。
    中午十二时正，当载着归来人员的对方汽车还未停稳时，一位满怀激愤的人民军被俘人员桂福就跳下了汽车，冲到一个美军少校的身旁，代表一百五十二个同伴抗议从釜山到汶山途中美方向他们施放毒气弹的暴行。
    今日归来的志愿军被俘人员比过去几天大大减少，其中有杜资明等七名被特别拘禁的被俘人员。他们说，还有五名和他们在一起的志愿军被俘人员仍被特别拘禁中。志愿军归来人员说，在釜山第七收容所，也还有被特别拘禁的志愿军被俘人员。
