    Yellow River's Upper and Middle Reaches See Continuous Rise in Water Levels
    Shandong and Other Regions Vigorously Conduct Flood Prevention Work
    [By Our Newspaper] Recently, continuous torrential rains in the middle reaches of the Yellow River have caused a sharp rise in the Yellow River's water level. From Shanxian, Henan, downstream, the floodwaters have approached the highest water level since liberation (1949). The Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters has issued flood forecasts and instructions for flood control measures to the flood control organizations in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The flood control organizations in the downstream provinces are organizing manpower to engage in the battle. In order to overcome this peak flood season in the Yellow River and ensure the safety of the dams, the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shandong Provincial People's Government dispatched Yuan Ziyang, Secretary-General of the Provincial People's Government, Ji Hua, member of the Rural Work Committee of the Branch Bureau, and Li Cheng, Vice Chairman of the Provincial Consultative Committee, to Heze and Liaocheng Prefectures on the evening of the 3rd to inspect and assist in flood control work. Liu Fupeng, Deputy Director of the Shandong Provincial Yellow River Conservancy Bureau, set off in the rain on the morning of the 3rd to provide specific guidance for flood control work in Guanshan. In addition, the Provincial Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters also dispatched cadres and technicians in batches on the 3rd and 4th to specifically assist various places along the river in consolidating the dams and conducting emergency repairs. More than 150 people from the Engineering Corps of the Provincial Yellow River Conservancy Bureau have gone to Liaocheng and Heze Prefectures on the 3rd and 4th. At present, responsible party and government cadres in various places along the Yellow River have also gone to the dikes to lead the masses in guarding the dikes and preventing dangers.
    Responsible cadres in important sections of the Yellow River flood situation, such as the Secretary of the Zhengzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Henan and the Commissioner of the Liaocheng Prefecture in Shandong, have all gone to the dams to guide flood prevention and emergency repairs. The Liaocheng Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China issued emergency instructions on the 2nd and 3rd. It demanded that all counties along the river should immediately take Yellow River flood control as the central task overriding all others. The county party secretaries and county heads of each county, and the district party secretaries and district heads of each district should personally lead the masses in guarding the dikes and preventing dangers, taking responsibility for each section to ensure that the dikes do not collapse. It also required the Shou Zhang County Committee to organize 500 militiamen as a mobile force, ready to be dispatched for emergency repairs at any time. In addition, it also required all counties along the river to make disaster relief preparations to support the disaster areas.
    In order to strengthen the specific leadership of flood control, the Liaocheng Prefecture has organized three inspection teams to assist the local party and government leading organs in implementing flood control work in the Yellow River Repair and Protection Office, the Fan County Temporary Command, and the Linqing Weihe River Command. Now the strong flood prevention teams organized by flood prevention cadres and the masses along the coast have taken to the dikes, and the flood prevention personnel in each river section are also patrolling day and night to strengthen flood prevention work.
    At present, the water situation in the upper reaches of the Yellow River is also increasing day by day, and the people of Suiyuan Province are actively participating in flood control work. The Sui West District convened a flood control committee meeting, drew up a flood control plan for the entire district, specifically deployed flood control work in important dangerous sections, and made a decision on the issue of water discharge to ensure that the Yellow River flow at the Dukoutang River is 4,500 cubic meters per second, so that all Yellow River dikes will not collapse. The Suizhong District Flood Control Headquarters convened a district-wide flood control meeting in Baotou on July 19. The meeting reviewed the implementation of the provincial flood control meeting resolutions by various cities and counties, heard the report of the flood control dike inspection team, and made decisions on consolidation projects and material cleanup. Specific regulations were made for the joint defense organizations of the Yellow River, canals, mountain gullies, and rivers and streams, dividing the boundaries by districts and sections, simplifying grassroots organizations, mobilizing the masses, and organizing herders to maintain the dikes. It also required all localities to promptly fill in rat holes, cracks, and rain-eroded gullies on the dikes. It guarantees that when the Yellow River flow at the Dengkou hydrological station in Baotou is 3,500 cubic meters per second, the dikes in various sections of the Suizhong District will not collapse.

    黄河上中游水位连续上涨
    山东等地大力进行防汛工作
    【本报讯】近来黄河中游连续暴雨，黄河水位陡涨，自河南陕县以下，洪水已接近解放后最高水位（一九四九年）的洪水高峰。黄河防汛总指挥部已向黄河下游各省防汛组织发出水情预报和指示防汛措施，下游各省防汛组织正组织人力投入战斗。为了战胜黄河这次伏汛最高洪峰，确保大堤安全，中共中央山东分局、山东省人民政府，已于三日晚派出省人民政府秘书长袁子扬、分局农村工作委员会委员纪华、省协商委员会副主席李澄之等，赴菏泽、聊城两专区检查帮助防汛工作。山东省黄河河务局副局长刘傅朋于三日上午冒雨出发，到观山具体指导防汛工作。另外，省黄河防汛指挥部也在三、四两日分批派出干部、技术人员，具体帮助沿河各地进行固堤抢险工作。省黄河河务局工程总队一百五十余人，已于三、四两日，分赴聊城、菏泽两专区。现沿黄河各地党政负责干部，也已纷纷上堤，带领群众守堤防险。
    黄河汛情重要地段的负责干部，中共河南郑州地委书记、山东聊城专区专员等都到大堤指导防汛抢险工作。中共聊城地委曾于二、三两日连续发出紧急指示。要求沿河各县应立即将黄河防汛作为压倒一切的中心任务，各县县委书记、县长，各区区委书记、区长应亲自带领群众守堤防险，按段负责，确保大堤不致溃决。并要求寿张县委组织五百名民兵，作为机动力量，准备随时出动抢险。此外，并要求沿河各县作好救灾准备，以便支援灾区。
    聊城专区为加强防汛的具体领导，已组织了三个检查组，分赴黄河修防处、范县临时指挥部以及临清渭河指挥部，协助当地党政领导机关贯彻防汛工作。现在沿岸防汛干部与群众所组织的强大防汛队伍已经上堤，各个河段的防汛员也正昼夜巡逻，加强防汛工作。
    目前，黄河上游水势也日见上涨，绥远省各地人民积极投入防汛工作。绥西区召开了防汛委员会议，订出全区防汛计划，具体布置了重要险工地段的防汛工作，并作出了关于泄水问题的决定，保证渡口堂黄河流量四千五百秒公方时，所有黄河堤防不生溃决。绥中区防汛指挥部于七月十九日在包头召开全区防汛会议，在会议中检查了各市、县对省防汛会议决议案的执行情况，听取了防洪堤检查组的报告，对整险工程，器材清理作了决定。对黄河、渠道、山沟河溪的联防组织，分区分段划清界线，简化基层组织，发动群众、组织放牧人养护堤坝等都作了具体规定，并要求各地将堤坝上的鼠穴、裂缝、雨淋沟等，及时填堵完竣。保证黄河流量在包头镫口水文站三千五百秒公方时，绥中区各段堤防不生溃决。
