    The Tongde County Tibetan Autonomous Region is a nomadic area spanning 120,000 square kilometers with a population of just over 20,000. Since the implementation of regional autonomy in November 1951, Chairman Dander of the Autonomous Region People's Government, in cooperation with and with the assistance of Gong Fuheng, Secretary of the CPC Tongde County Tibetan Autonomous Region Working Committee, has smoothly launched various construction projects.

    Gong Fuheng transferred from the People's Liberation Army to work in the pastoral area. He participated in the 25,000-li Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War. In the autumn of 1950, when he was transferred to Tongde by his superiors, all the tribes, from the thousands of households, hundreds of households, and headmen to the herders, unanimously hoped to stop tribal armed conflicts, stabilize social order, and allow everyone to concentrate on production. The People's Government also attached great importance to this work. But where to start? Initially, Gong Fuheng worked with Dander, an elder respected by the local Tibetans. They selected a dispute that had been entangled for more than thirty years and mediated it. This dispute had involved 37 armed conflicts, resulting in the loss of five lives and 75 livestock on both sides. According to traditional pastoral customs, the 37 conflicts had to be resolved one by one, which meant the problem could never be solved. They repeatedly studied the local situation and decided to ask both parties to recount the causes of the 37 armed conflicts one by one. As a result, it became clear that the origins of the disputes were all minor matters, but because the problems had not been resolved for a long time, the disputes gradually escalated. Both sides understood the causes of the armed conflicts and their harmful consequences, and no one wanted to continue the conflicts, so the dispute was easily resolved.

    They worked together for 70 days, specifically selecting the most difficult disputes to mediate, and resolved more than 80 cases in total. As a result, the entire region rejoiced, and Dander's confidence in his work greatly increased. He went deep into various tribes alone, adopted the same working methods, and led the thousands of households, hundreds of households, and headmen of each tribe to vigorously carry out a campaign to mediate disputes. In the past two years, they have mediated more than 3,000 disputes, creating excellent conditions for the Autonomous Region to carry out various construction projects.

    With Gong Fuheng's specific assistance, Dander became increasingly enthusiastic about taking charge. He worked all day long, responsible for handling every government affair of the People's Government. In February of this year, he inspected the work of the second and third districts of the Autonomous Region and the Laja Temple area, and correctly handled the problem of disrespect for the local Tibetan district head by outside cadres in the second district. At the beginning of this summer, there was a lack of rain, and he led Tibetan men and women farmers to dig springs and wells day and night to overcome the difficulty of water shortage on the grassland.

    Due to the unity and efforts of the cadres, the Tongde County Tibetan Autonomous Region has achieved great success in its work. The number of livestock in the region is gradually increasing. The number of sheep alone has increased by 75 percent compared to the time of liberation. The development of the Autonomous Region's transportation industry and sideline production ranks first in Qinghai Province, with an income of approximately 4 billion yuan last year alone, which is equivalent to the price of 30,000 sheep. Education has also developed greatly. In the past, no schools had ever been established in the pastoral areas. Now, 25 primary schools have been established.

    When Dander talked about the achievements of the Autonomous Region's work, he said: "The reason why the Autonomous Region's work has achieved relatively good results is mainly due to the greatness of Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, the correct leadership of the Provincial People's Government, the specific assistance of Secretary Gong Fuheng, and the efforts of all cadres and the broad masses of herders."

    Under their leadership, the Tongde County Tibetan Autonomous Region continues to move forward.

    团结和前进中的同德县藏族自治区
    新华社记者    程堃
    同德县藏族自治区是一个面积达十二万平方公里，而人口仅两万多的游牧区。自一九五一年十一月区域自治后，自治区人民政府主席丹德尔在中共同德县藏族自治区工作委员会书记龚福恒的合作与帮助下，各项建设工作已顺利展开。
    龚福恒是从人民解放军中转业到牧区工作的。他参加过二万五千里长征、抗日战争、人民解放战争。一九五零年秋天，他被上级调到同德工作时，各部落上自千户、百户、头人，下至牧民群众，一致希望停止部落械斗，安定社会秩序，使大家安心生产。人民政府也十分重视这一工作。但从何下手呢？开始，龚福恒就和当地藏民所爱戴的老人丹德尔一道工作。他们挑选了一件纠缠了三十几年的纠纷，进行调解。这场纠纷先后械斗了三十七次，双方共损失五条人命和七十五头牲口。按照牧区传统习惯，三十七次要一次一次地分别解决，这样，问题就永远解决不了。他们反复地研究了当地情况，决定请双方把三十七次械斗事件的原因，一件件地追述出来。结果，弄清了纠纷的起因原来都是些小事，但因为问题长时期得不到解决，所以纠纷便逐渐扩大了。双方明白了械斗原因和产生的恶果，谁都不愿意继续械斗下去，因此这场纠纷就迎刃而解了。
    他们一道工作了七十天，专门挑选那些最难调解的纠纷帮助解决，前后共调解了八十多件。于是全区欢腾，丹德尔的工作信心大大地提高了。他单独深入各部落，采用同样的工作方法，领导各部落的千户、百户、头人，大力开展调解纠纷的运动，两年来共调解了三千多件纠纷，给自治区开展各项建设工作创造了很好的条件。
    在龚福恒具体的帮助下，丹德尔当家作主的劲头越来越大。他整天工作，负责处理人民政府的每件政务。今年二月，他检查了自治区二、三区和拉加寺区等三个区的工作。并正确地处理了二区外来干部不尊重本地藏族区长问题。今年夏初缺雨，他又率领藏族男女农民，不分昼夜地掏泉挖井克服了草原上缺水的困难。
    同德县藏族自治区由于干部的团结与努力，工作已有很大成绩，现在全区的牲畜数量逐渐上升。仅羊只就比解放时增加了百分之七十五。自治区的运输业和副业生产的发展在青海省占第一位，仅去年一年就收入四十亿元左右，约等于三万只羊的价格。教育方面也有很大发展。过去牧区从没有设立过学校，现在，已成立了二十五所小学。
    当丹德尔谈到自治区的工作成绩时，他说：“自治区的工作所以有比较好的成绩，主要是毛主席民族政策的伟大，省人民政府正确的领导，龚福恒书记的具体帮助，以及全体干部和牧民群众的努力。”
    同德县藏族自治区就在他们的领导下，继续向前进。
