Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 2nd: According to TASS, The Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party have passed a resolution to reduce the uniform retail prices of consumer goods, effective August 3rd. The resolution states that the completion of the first five-year national economic plan in four years, the significant increase in the production of consumer goods, the increase in labor productivity, and the reduction in production costs have made it possible for the Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party to implement a new, third reduction in the state's uniform retail prices of consumer goods. This price reduction once again clearly demonstrates the Party and the government's concern for the continuous improvement of the material and cultural standards of the working people. This new price reduction will save residents 900 million leva (Bulgarian currency) annually just by purchasing goods from state-owned stores and cooperative stores.
According to the decision of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria and the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the food products with reduced state uniform retail prices include: bread, reduced by 11 to 14 percent; flour, 15 percent; pasta, 20 percent; vegetable oil, 10 to 11 percent; lard, 10 percent; dairy products, 4 to 6 percent; meat, 10 percent; apples and grapes, 20 percent; sugar products, 4 to 15 percent, etc. The manufactured goods with reduced prices include: cotton fabrics, with an average price reduction of 15 percent; woolen fabrics, 4 to 18 percent; ready-made clothing, 5 to 18 percent; shoes, 5 to 10 percent, etc. The prices of building materials, clothing items, sports equipment, and other items have also been reduced.
