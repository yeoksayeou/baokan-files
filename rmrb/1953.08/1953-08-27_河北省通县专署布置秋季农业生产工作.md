    Tongxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Hebei Province convened an expanded county magistrate meeting on August 8 to discuss and arrange autumn agricultural production work. In the autumn harvest work, the meeting demanded that all localities extensively organize mutual aid and labor exchange to achieve timely harvesting and prevent the intrusion of disasters such as wind, water, and hail. In addition to the public security armed forces being responsible for organizing militia joint defense to protect the autumn harvest, the work of guarding the autumn harvest should also mobilize the masses to combine with each other according to land neighbors and organize autumn protection teams. At the same time, according to the different conditions in various places, mobilize farmers to conduct field seed selection or field seed selection to gradually promote improved varieties. During the autumn harvest, technology promotion stations and farms should pay attention to summarizing high-yield experiences. High-yield fields should be organized for mutual aid group members, agricultural producers' cooperative members, and village cadres to visit.
    The meeting demanded that all localities must strengthen their leadership over autumn plowing work and truly achieve universal plowing once. In autumn plowing, human and animal mutual aid should be widely organized to give full play to strength. General areas advocate plowing as soon as possible after harvesting; in individual areas lacking animal power, on the one hand, farmers should be mobilized to rely on relatives and friends to borrow land for plowing, and on the other hand, households with livestock should be mobilized to sell plowing services to areas lacking plowing animals to solve the difficulty of insufficient animal power. In areas near cities where many people are engaged in transportation work, attention should be paid to resolving the contradiction between transportation and autumn plowing so that autumn plowing work is not affected.
    In terms of wheat planting, increasing yield per unit area, and in areas where conditions permit (i.e., good soil moisture, abundant rainfall, no shortage of wheat seeds, sufficient fertilizer, and planting wheat does not affect the increase in coarse grain production), calling on the masses to plant more wheat is a very important task. Regarding specific measures to increase wheat yield per unit area, the meeting believes that close planting is a main method. However, due to different soil qualities and different farming methods in various places, some people still have doubts about close wheat planting. Therefore, when promoting close wheat planting, it should be based on the specific conditions and habits of the masses in various places, and a step should be taken on the original basis.
    Recently, there have been continuous autumn rains and many rivers have risen. The meeting specifically proposed that efforts should be made to do a good job in flood prevention to ensure the autumn harvest. The meeting demanded that leading cadres at all levels must clearly establish the idea of production first and do a good job in all other tasks on the premise of completing the autumn production work.

    河北省通县专署布置秋季农业生产工作
    河北省通县专员公署，在八月八日召开了县长扩大会议，讨论和布置了秋季农业生产工作。在秋收工作中，会议要求各地广泛组织互助换工，做到及时收割，防止风、水、冰雹等灾害的侵袭。护秋工作除由公安武装部门切实负责组织民兵联防保卫外，并要发动群众按地邻互相结合，组织护秋小组。同时，根据各地不同条件，发动农民进行田间选种或场中选种，以逐渐推广良种。在秋收中，技术推广站和农场要注意总结丰产经验，对于高额丰产田，应组织互助组员、农业生产合作社员及村干部参观。
    会议要求各地必须加强对秋耕工作的领导，真正做到普耕一遍。在秋耕中，应广泛组织人、畜互助搭套，充分发挥力量。一般地区提倡随收随耕；个别畜力缺乏地区，一方面动员农民投靠亲友，借套耕地，一方面发动有牲畜户到缺乏耕畜的地区卖套，以解决畜力不足的困难。在城廓附近从事运输工作的人较多的地方，应注意解决运输和秋耕的矛盾，不要使秋耕工作受到影响。
    在种麦方面，提高单位面积产量，及在有条件地区（即墒土好，雨水大，麦种不缺，有足够肥料及种小麦不影响粗粮增产的地区），号召群众多种麦，是一个非常重要的任务。对提高小麦单位面积产量的具体措施，会议认为密植是一个主要方法。但由于各地土质不同，耕作方法各异，有些群众对小麦密植还有疑虑，所以，推广小麦密植时应根据各地具体情况和群众习惯，在原有基础上提高一步。
    最近，秋雨连绵，许多河流涨水，会议特别提出要努力做好防汛工作，以确保秋收。会议要求各级领导干部要明确树立生产第一的思想，在完成秋季生产工作的前提下做好其他各项工作。
