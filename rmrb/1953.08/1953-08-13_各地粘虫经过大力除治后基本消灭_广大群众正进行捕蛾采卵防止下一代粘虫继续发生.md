After armyworms occurred in various places this year, mass insect eradication movements were formed in most areas. At present, the first and second generations of armyworms in these areas have been basically eliminated, and moth catching, egg collecting, and other work are being carried out to prevent the next generation of armyworms from occurring. The Northeast Administrative Committee proposed that combining hoeing with pest control as the overriding central task at the initial stage of the armyworm outbreak. Many areas in Northeast China mobilized a large amount of manpower in pest control. In order to concentrate manpower on pest control in Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, Songjiang and other provinces, rural primary schools generally took early holidays. In Songjiang Province alone, 730,000 students participated in insect catching during the holidays. Liaodong Province organized more than 3,000 cadres to go deep into the countryside and join with over a million people in catching insects. According to incomplete statistics from only Andong, Liaoyang, Hailong, and Ji'an counties, more than 100,000 catties of insects were killed, controlling the spread of armyworms and avoiding major disasters. After overcoming paralysis, the farmers in Baodi County, Hebei Province, had more than 4,700 people participating in the insect eradication work. In five days, they eradicated insect pests on more than 4,000 mu of land in ten villages with severe insect infestations, killing more than 7,300 catties of insects. After the eradication, the number of insects generally decreased by 60 percent. In Ningxia Province, Zhongning County organized more than 10,000 people to catch insects, catching more than 155,900 catties of armyworms in seven days, and also eliminated a large number of pupae. In Yunnan Province, one district in Baoshan County caught more than 110,000 catties of insects. At present, in areas where the previous generation of armyworms have pupated or transformed into moths to lay eggs, moth catching and egg collecting work has been carried out in a timely manner in order to fundamentally prevent the occurrence of armyworms. For example, the masses in Gaiping, Kuandian, Xinjin, Huanren, Linjiang and other counties in Liaodong Province have begun to catch moths and collect eggs. In Zizhe River and other nine villages in Xinjin County, nearly 2,000 people were organized to collect and destroy more than 30 million egg-laden leaves (each egg-laden leaf has dozens of eggs), which will greatly reduce the occurrence of armyworms.

In addition, there have been many innovations and experiences in the process of catching armyworms in various places. For example, the masses in Shandong, Gansu, Northeast China and other places have created various simple insect catching devices in accordance with local conditions. The Xiongyue Farm in Liaodong has tested a method of trapping moths with large rice straw bundles, which has proven very effective. This method involves binding more than 50 rice straws into an umbrella-shaped bundle, hanging it on a pole five or six feet above the ground. The tips of the inverted straw bundles are close to the crop leaves, in order to attract armyworm moths to lay eggs on the straw bundles. In terms of organizing and leading insect control, there have also been many improvements in various places. Shandong Province uses mutual aid teams and production cooperatives as units, or voluntarily combines with neighboring areas to catch insects, which not only gives play to the enthusiasm of the masses in catching insects, but also avoids trampling on crops. Shanxi Province organized joint village and joint prevention, digging ditches to block and eliminate areas in sections, and organized temporary insect eradication mutual aid groups, thereby improving insect eradication efficiency.

    各地粘虫经过大力除治后基本消灭
    广大群众正进行捕蛾采卵防止下一代粘虫继续发生
    今年各地发生粘虫后，大部地区都形成了群众性的除虫运动。目前这些地区第一、二代粘虫已基本消灭，正进行捕蛾、采卵等工作，以防止下一代的粘虫发生。东北行政委员会在粘虫发生初期，即提出以铲趟结合治虫为压倒一切的中心任务。东北许多地区在治虫中动员了大量的人力。辽东、辽西、吉林、松江等省为集中人力治虫，一般农村小学都提前放假，仅松江一省就有七十三万学生趁假期参加捕虫。辽东省全省共组织三千多名干部深入农村和百余万群众一起进行捕虫。仅据安东、辽阳、海龙、辑安四县不完全统计，共灭虫十万斤以上，控制了粘虫的蔓延，避免了造成重大的灾害。河北省宝坻县的农民在克服麻痹思想后，即有四千七百多人参加除虫工作，五天内在虫害严重的十个村，除治了四千多亩地里的虫害，灭虫七千三百余斤，捕打后一般虫子减少了百分之六十。宁夏省中宁县组织一万多人捕虫，七天即捕捉粘虫十五万五千九百多斤，还消灭了大量虫蛹。云南省的保山县一个区就捕虫十一万多斤。目前各地在前一代粘虫已变蛹或化蛾产卵的地区，为了从根本上防治粘虫的发生，已及时进行了捕蛾采卵工作。如辽东省的盖平、宽甸、新金、桓仁、临江等县的群众已开始捕蛾、采卵。新金县赞子河等九村即组织了近两千人采毁卵叶三千多万片（每片卵叶有卵十几粒到几十粒），这将大大减轻粘虫的发生。
    此外各地在捕打粘虫过程中，也有不少创造和经验。如山东、甘肃、东北等地群众因地制宜地创造了各种简便的捕虫器。辽东熊岳农场试验出一种大谷草把诱蛾法，效果很好。这个方法是用五十余根谷草绑成伞状草把，垂挂在离地五、六尺的杆上，倒垂的谷草把的尖端与庄稼叶相近，以诱集粘虫蛾在草把上产卵。在组织领导治虫方面，各地也有很多改进，山东省以互助组、生产合作社为单位，或以地邻自愿结合进行捕虫，既发挥了群众捕虫的积极性，又避免了踏毁庄稼。山西省组织联村联防，挖沟封锁，分片消灭，并组织临时除虫互助组，因而提高了除虫效率。
