    CPC Nanyang Prefectural Committee Accepts Reader Opinions and Seriously Deals with Illegal Cadre Zhang Yunsong

    Reader Duan Fucai and five others wrote: Zhang Yunsong, Secretary of the Nanhe Township Party Committee of Nanzhao County, Henan Province, has lost his position, shielded landlords, and condoned his wife, Fu Qingxia, in squandering and wasting, creating extremely negative political impacts.

    Fu Qingxia's family belongs to the landlord class (her father was a puppet district chief and is currently under mass control). After she started working in 1949, she pretended to be active for a while and joined the Communist Youth League. Later, she was transferred to work in Nanhe Township and married Zhang Yunsong. After that, she fully exposed her landlord class nature, became passive in her work, extravagant in her life, and held serious hedonistic ideas. After becoming pregnant in October 1951, she simply stopped working. In June of last year, Fu Qingxia fell ill after giving birth. Her condition was not serious, but she deliberately stayed in bed, having everything served by a female worker. She had a special small stove set up in the district, once making eighteen meals in one day and night, some of which were made and then dumped in the water tank without being eaten. In order to reduce Zhang Yunsong's troubles, the organization approved her treatment at Nanyang Hospital. However, Fu Qingxia was afraid that she would be "constrained" by hospital rules after being admitted, and that she would not be able to enjoy herself arbitrarily after her condition was clearly checked, so she insisted on not going. Zhang Yunsong hired more than twenty doctors to "treat" her, and two or three doctors often lived in the office. Among these doctors, many were members of reactionary secret societies, landlords, puppet village chiefs, and other bad elements who were fundamentally unable to cure diseases. They casually prescribed expensive tonic drugs such as ginseng and velvet antler in the prescriptions, and Zhang Yunsong would immediately buy them; however, many of the medicines were not fully decocted before Fu Qingxia dumped them and refused to eat them.

    Zhang Yunsong also shielded Fu Qingxia's landlord family. Fu Qingxia's brother, Fu Baoxiang, sent many clothes, jewelry, and other items in August 1951, which Zhang Yunsong hid for him and introduced Fu Baoxiang to Hezhuang Township to become a teacher. During the rectification movement, many district cadres suggested that Zhang Yunsong should make a review of the above facts, but Zhang Yunsong refused on the grounds of excuses. In addition, landlord element Zeng Xianmo, who used to be a puppet village chief, often lived in the same room with Zhang Yunsong in the district committee under the pretext of "treating" Fu Qingxia. The peasants were also very dissatisfied with this matter.

    Zhang Yunsong's behavior of suppressing criticism and retaliating against others was also very serious. For example, in May 1951, someone in Shangen Township in this district wrote to the higher-level government to report that Township Chief Zhang Wenqing was shielding landlords and local bullies. When the county inquired about this matter, Zhang Yunsong not only did not investigate and deal with it, but instead believed that bad people were making trouble and falsely accusing cadres, and wanted to investigate the whistleblower. At this time, it happened that Cao Keming, a peasant in the township, had opinions on the land survey and production determination work, and went to the district to appeal and express his opinions on the township chief. Zhang Yunsong said that Cao Keming was deliberately making trouble, detained him, and forced him to write a self-criticism. In July of the same year, poor peasant Cao Changren asked cultural and educational committee member Zhao Shutang to write a letter to the district and county to report Zhang Wenqing's embezzlement and other illegal facts. Zhang Yunsong saw that the content of this report was similar to a previous one, so he detained the scribe Zhao Shutang and Cao Changren's father, Cao Jinduo, for several months.

    Zhang Yunsong's mistakes are even more numerous! Because the leading organs of Nanhe Township lack democratic style, the lower-level cadres dare not express their opinions to the higher-ups, and some district-level leading comrades hold a liberal attitude and do not criticize Zhang Yunsong's erroneous behavior, so the problem has not been exposed for a long time. We hope that you will urge the higher-level Party committee to thoroughly investigate Zhang Yunsong's mistakes and seriously deal with them.

### 中共南阳地委接受读者意见严肃处理违法干部张云松

专栏：读者来信摘要

    中共南阳地委接受读者意见严肃处理违法干部张云松
    读者段复财等六人来信：中共河南省南召县南河店区委书记张云松丧失立场、包庇地主，并纵容他的爱人符青霞挥霍浪费，在政治上造成了极端恶劣的影响。
    符青霞的家庭是地主成分（她的父亲是伪区长，现受群众管制）。她在一九四九年参加工作后，曾一度伪装积极，混入团内。后来她调到南河店区工作，就与张云松结婚。此后，她充分暴露了地主阶级的本质，工作消极，生活奢侈，享乐思想十分严重；她在一九五一年十月怀孕后，便干脆不做工作了。去年六月，符青霞产后得病，病情并不严重，故意不下床，一切叫女工侍奉。她在区里专设一个小灶，曾经有一日一夜做过十八顿饭，有的做了不吃就倒在水缸里。组织上为了减轻张云松的麻烦，曾批准她到南阳医院治疗。但符青霞怕入院后要受院规“约束”，而且检查清楚病情后不能任意享受，就坚持不去。张云松先后请了二十余名医生为她“治病”，经常住机关的医生就有两三人。这些医生中，有许多是反动会道门分子、地主、伪保长等坏分子，根本不能治病。他们随便在药方中开些参茸等贵重补剂药品，张云松就马上去买；但很多药品没有煎透符青霞就倒掉不吃了。
    张云松还包庇符青霞的地主家庭。符青霞的哥哥符保祥于一九五一年八月送来许多衣服首饰等物品，张云松就代为隐藏起来，并介绍符保祥到贺庄乡去当教员。整风时不少区干部提出要张云松对以上事实作检查，张云松竟找藉口拒绝了。此外，地主分子曾宪漠，过去当过伪保长，但他却以为符青霞“治病”为名，经常在区委会与张云松同住一间屋子。农民们对这件事也很不满意。
    张云松平时压制批评、打击报复的行为也很严重。如一九五一年五月本区山根乡有人向上级政府写信检举乡长张文庆包庇地主恶霸。县里追问这事时，张云松不但不进行调查和处理，反而认为是坏人捣乱、诬告干部，要追查检举人。这时正好有该乡农民曹克明对查田定产工作有意见，到区里去申诉，并且对乡长提出意见。张云松就说曹克明故意捣乱，将他扣起来并迫令写反省书。同年七月，该乡贫农曹长任请文教委员赵书堂代笔向区、县检举张文庆贪污等违法事实，张云松看到这份检举材料和过去的一份内容相仿，就将代笔人赵书堂和曹长任的父亲曹金铎扣押了好几个月。
    张云松的错误事实还多着呢！因为南河店区的领导机关缺乏民主作风，下面干部不敢对上级提意见，而有些区级领导同志抱着自由主义态度，对张云松的错误行为不进行批评，因此问题长期没有被揭发。我们希望你们督促上级党委彻底检查张云松的错误，并严肃地加以处理。
