Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Vietnam News Agency, 15th: The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army recently released a communiqué on the achievements and military situation on the North Vietnam battlefield in June and July.

The communiqué stated that, according to incomplete statistics, the People's Army annihilated over 3,000 enemy troops on the North Vietnam battlefield in June and July, including 720 captured; seized 462 machine guns and rifles, and 5 mortars; destroyed 376 motorcycles and vehicles, 2 gunboats, 4 steamboats, and a large amount of other ammunition and equipment.

The communiqué pointed out that after suffering successive defeats in the early months of this year, the French army hurriedly dispatched troops to rescue the European and African mobile units that had been dealt devastating blows by the People's Army, launching some small-scale "sweeps" in an attempt to counter guerrilla activities and help relieve besieged strongholds. However, the People's Army regular forces, local troops, and guerrillas on the left bank of the Red River continued to achieve victories, creating favorable conditions for the development of people's guerrilla warfare. The communiqué stated that after the People's Army launched a surprise attack on Jian'an City in April, it launched an offensive against Haiphong Port in July, proving that the People's Army was capable of annihilating a large number of enemy troops in enemy-occupied cities that the enemy considered to be the safest.

The communiqué also pointed out that in Central and South Vietnam, the People's Army also strengthened its activities in coordination with the main battlefield in North Vietnam. The People's Army repelled two enemy "sweeps" in the watery plains of South Vietnam, resulting in 600 puppet troops and a company of Hoa Hao troops defecting to the people's side.

The communiqué concluded by pointing out that despite the defeats it has suffered, the enemy is preparing to launch more "sweeps" and paratrooper raids against guerrilla bases or liberated areas. Therefore, the People's Army must strengthen guerrilla warfare in enemy-held areas and redouble its vigilance in order to crush all new enemy conspiracies.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Vietnam News Agency: In the past few months, the Vietnam People's Army has continuously attacked the French army in enemy-held areas and carried out counter-sweeping operations, achieving many victories.

On July 12, the People's Army attacked a train on the Haiphong-Hai Duong railway carrying nearly 1,000 French troops, derailing eight carriages and killing or wounding hundreds of French troops. On July 27, the French troops stationed along the Black River defense line in Shanxi Province, fearing an attack by the People's Army, hurriedly withdrew from five strongholds.

In northern Central Vietnam, the People's Army conducted more than 1,300 battles in the first half of this year, killing or wounding 5,200 French troops, including 29 lieutenants and many non-commissioned officers. They also seized many weapons.

In South Vietnam, the People's Army crushed a French "sweep" against the watery plains in late July. In this "sweep," the French army mobilized four battalions of troops, 30 amphibious tanks, and many gunboats. However, they were resisted by the People's Army everywhere and suffered heavy losses, hurriedly withdrawing from the watery plains in just one week.

    越人民军六、七月在北越战场歼敌三千余
    中越北部今年上半年杀伤敌军五千余人
    【新华社十六日讯】据越南通讯社十五日讯：越南人民军总部最近发表关于六、七月份北越战场的战绩及军事形势的公报。
    公报说，据还不完全统计，人民军六、七月份在北越战场上共歼灭敌军三千人以上，其中俘掳七百二十人；缴获机枪和步枪四百六十二支、迫击炮五门；击毁摩托车辆三百七十六辆、炮艇两艘、汽船四艘和其他大量弹药、装备。
    公报指出：法军在今年年初几个月遭受了接连失败以后，曾慌忙派兵救援遭受人民军歼灭性打击的欧、非机动部队，发动了一些小规模的“扫荡”，企图对付游击活动和帮助被围困的据点解围。但是，北越战场上的人民军正规部队、地方部队和游击队在红河左岸仍然不断取得胜利，并为人民游击战争的发展创造了良好条件。公报说：人民军在四月份对建安城进行突袭之后，在七月份又向海防港发动了进攻，证明人民军能够在敌人认为最安全的敌占城市中歼灭大量的敌人有生力量。
    公报并指出：在中越和南越，人民军也配合北越主要战场加强活动。人民军在南越水草平原击退了敌军的两次“扫荡”，结果有六百名伪军和一连和好教军队投到人民方面来。
    公报最后指出：敌人不顾它所遭受的失败，正准备向游击根据地或解放区发动更多的“扫荡”和伞兵突袭。因此，人民军必须加强敌后地区的游击战，加倍提高警惕，以便粉碎敌人的一切新阴谋。
    【新华社十六日讯】据越南通讯社讯：在过去的几个月中，越南人民军在敌后地区不断进攻法军并进行了反扫荡战，取得了许多胜利。
    七月十二日，人民军袭击海防—海阳铁路上的载有近一千名法军的火车一列，使八节车厢脱轨，法军死伤数百人。七月二十七日，沿山西省黑水江防线驻扎的法军，害怕人民军的进攻，慌忙从五个据点撤走。
    在中越北部，人民军在今年上半年进行了一千三百多次战斗，杀伤法军五千二百人，其中有二十九个尉级军官和许多士官。他们还缴获了许多武器。
    在南越，人民军在七月下旬粉碎了法军对水草平原的一次“扫荡”。在这次“扫荡”中，法军曾出动了四个营军队、三十辆水陆两用战车和许多炮艇。但是他们到处遭到人民军的阻击，损失惨重，仅一个星期就慌忙撤出水草平原。
