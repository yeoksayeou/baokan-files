    National Transportation Conference Opens in Beijing

    To further improve transportation construction and transportation work to adapt to the large-scale economic construction that is beginning nationwide, the National Transportation Conference opened in Beijing on the 21st of this month.

    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the Central Ministry of Transportation, New China's transportation industry has made considerable achievements in the past three years. In terms of basic construction, a total of over 1,700 kilometers of new highways have been built, over 8,000 kilometers have been rebuilt, nearly 14,000 kilometers have been restored, and over 23,000 kilometers have been surveyed and designed in the past three years. In terms of waterways, a total of 54 new ships have been added, over 50 old ships have been repaired, 44 sunken ships have been salvaged, and 2 tugboats with a total of 1,030 horsepower have been repaired in the past three years. In addition, ports and harbors such as Huangpu Port and Xingang have been reorganized, and over 28.8 million cubic meters of mud have been dredged from various ports and waterways. In terms of transportation production, in 1952 alone, state-owned automobiles completed over 4.2 million tons of freight volume, over 270 million ton-kilometers of freight turnover, over 41 million passengers, and over 1.1 billion passenger-kilometers of passenger turnover; inland river tugboats nationwide completed over 9.6 million tons of freight volume, over 3.67 billion ton-kilometers of freight turnover, over 27 million passengers, and over 1.7 billion passenger-kilometers of passenger turnover; coastal transportation nationwide completed over 4 million tons of freight volume, over 2 billion ton-nautical miles of freight turnover, over 760,000 passengers, and over 100 million passenger-nautical miles of passenger turnover. Although considerable achievements have been made in the past three years, there are still many problems that urgently need to be resolved. For example, the transportation sector has failed to grasp the regularity and characteristics of the flow of major materials, and the lack of coordination in various aspects has prevented the formation of a holistic and rational transportation system. The most prominent problems are high freight rates, untimely transportation, high damage rates, and insufficient transportation capacity. In terms of basic construction, there is a lack of investigation and research on basic conditions, and the phenomenon of chaotic construction and lack of responsibility is still quite serious. The most serious problems are the neglect of surveying and design work and the lack of design strength. Since China has begun large-scale economic construction, the national transportation industry must be subject to unified and planned leadership. In the past, the unclear division of labor between the central and local governments has prevented local transportation from adapting well to the development of the national economy and meeting the needs of local people. These issues will be properly addressed at this conference.

    全国交通会议在京开幕
    为了进一步提高交通建设和运输工作，以适应全国正在开始的大规模经济建设，全国交通会议于本月二十一日在京开幕。
    新中国的交通事业，三年来在毛主席、中央人民政府和中央交通部的领导下，获得不少成绩。在基本建设上，三年来共新建公路一千七百余公里，改建八千余公里，恢复近一万四千公里，测设二万三千余公里；航路方面，三年来共新添船舶五十四艘，修复旧船五十余艘，打捞沉船四十四艘，修复拖轮二艘，共一千零三十匹马力，并重新整理了黄浦港和新港等港湾，各港和航道挖泥二千八百余万方。在运输生产上，仅就一九五二年来说，国营汽车就完成货运量四百二十余万吨，完成货物周转量二亿七千余万吨公里，完成客运量四千一百余万人，完成旅客周转量十一亿人公里；全国内河轮驳共完成货运量九百六十余万吨，完成货物周转量三十六亿七千余万吨公里，客运量完成二千七百余万人，完成旅客周转量十七亿余人公里；全国沿海运输共完成货运量四百余万吨，完成货物周转量二十余亿吨浬，完成客运七十六万余人，完成客运周转量一亿余人浬。过去三年来的工作虽已获得不少成就，但还存在着许多问题，急需加以解决。如交通运输部门未能很好掌握主要物资流向的规律性及其特点，各方面工作不协调，以致不能形成整体的合理运输。而最突出的问题是运费高，运输不及时而且货损率高，运输力不足。在基本建设方面，对基本情况缺乏调查研究，施工混乱和无人负责现象尚相当严重，而最严重的是忽视测设工作以及设计力量的不足。由于我国已开始大规模的经济建设，全国交通运输事业必须加以统一的有计划的领导。过去由于中央和地方分工不明确，致使地方交通事业未能很好适应国民经济的发展和满足地方人民的需要。这些问题都将在这次大会中加以适当的解决。
