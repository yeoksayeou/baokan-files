    Transforming the Earth into a Giant Flower
    Yang Shuo

    The day I flew from Beijing to Bucharest was the day after the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. I hadn't had time to hear the cheers of my own people celebrating the victory, but in Bucharest, I heard the cheers of people from all over the world. You can imagine the kind of joy that erupted among the young people from various countries gathered in this city when the news of peace in Korea reached the Danube River. The Chinese representatives were hoisted up, and the Chinese and Korean people's heroes from the Korean battlefield were hoisted up. People shouted, embraced, and many waved their tears of joy. Yes, tears, expressing such a sacred human emotion. I have been to Korea. For years, I knew the price the Chinese and Korean people paid for victory, and I also knew the strength contributed by people all over the world. Now, on the eve of our festival, the enemy of peace has finally bowed its head before us.

    Bucharest is a very beautiful city, with red bananas, roses, begonias, and all kinds of flowers blooming everywhere. Today, it has gathered the most beautiful youth, the most beautiful ideals, and the most beautiful hopes of all mankind. Whether on tall buildings or on colorful flags, you can see phrases written in Soviet, Chinese, Romanian, and various other languages: "Peace and Friendship." In the streets and alleys, in Republic Square, and in Stalin Park, you will also encounter large groups of young men and women, wearing various brightly colored national costumes, arm in arm, clapping rhythmically and enthusiastically repeating the same phrase: "Peace and Friendship." This is not just a slogan, it is our most beautiful wish for human life.

    This wish has already been realized among most of humanity on Earth. From every corner of the festival, I am happy to see the entire future of mankind, the future of the world. A sea of colorful flags, a field of flowers, Bucharest today has become a world of brocade, full of intoxicating songs and dances, and youthful laughter. Here are heroes from Vietnam, white-haired elders from Australia, black brothers from the "Gold Coast" of Africa, and people from every corner of the world. Although everyone's skin color and clothing are different, their languages are different, and their thoughts and beliefs are not the same, although everyone comes from across oceans, forests, and high mountains, the belief in peace makes everyone's hearts connected forever. Here, whether you know each other or not, everyone is the closest brother, the closest sister. A five or six-year-old Romanian girl will run up, hold your hand, and ask with a smile in Chinese, "Hello?" A young man from Lebanon will point at you and ask, "China?" and then hug you and kiss you on both cheeks. Italians, Belgians, and Argentinians will surround an Indian brother on the street, vying to ask him for an autograph. A female dancer from Egypt, with beautiful earrings shaking on her ears, will hug you and say, "China is our example. You have stood up, and we will definitely stand up too." I have seen that when the Vietnamese youth representatives appeared in front of the crowd, the French youth swarmed up, shook hands, embraced, presented flowers, and finally carried the Vietnamese war heroes on their shoulders for a parade. I have also seen that when the mighty Soviet youth contingent walked into the Romanian "August 23rd" Square, everyone in the audience stood up, waving colorful handkerchiefs and cheering like thunder, because we all knew that only the Soviet Union is the most powerful guarantee of peace.

    At dusk, when the lights came on and the music played, the city's squares were filled with young people, densely packed, and you couldn't even see people's faces clearly, only a sea of colorful costumes, like flowers and plants planted in a garden. In the crowd, young people from various countries held hands, forming circles, stepping to the rhythm of the fast-paced music, and dancing in circles. Everywhere is flowers, everywhere is love, it is unimaginable that there would still be pain, hunger, or slaughter among mankind.

    But we will never forget that in some corners of the earth, pain still exists. When I hug my Lebanese or Egyptian friends, my heart feels warm, and also a little painful, I cannot help but think of the disasters their people are suffering. The Romanian people rushed to build a beautiful white building, which exhibited photos of people's lives from various countries. I saw the great creations and constructions of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and various new democratic countries. But in the photos of Malaya, I also saw a British soldier, holding two human heads in his arms, grinning triumphantly. Devils! Who can allow these bloody crimes to stain the dignity of mankind? We have the power to win the victory in Korea, and we also have the power to wash these crimes from the earth.

    That day, the day of the opening of the World Youth Festival, Romanian youth used their bodies to form a beautiful large flower bud. Wave-like patterns spread from the flower base, and the human flower bud unfolded, blooming into a red flower. This is our belief. One day, we will definitely be able to transform the world, transforming the entire earth into such a big flower, making the lives of all mankind like Bucharest today, everywhere with flowers, everywhere with love, everywhere with songs and music.

    For our flower-like life, for the future, we will never hesitate to dedicate our bodies to weave this big flower.

    把地球改造成一朵大花
    杨朔
    我从北京飞往布加勒斯特那天，正是朝鲜停战协定签字的第二天。我还来不及听到我的祖国人民庆祝胜利的欢笑，但在布加勒斯特，我却听到整个世界人民的欢笑了。你想像得出，当朝鲜的和平消息一传到多瑙河流域，集中在这座城市的各国青年爆发出怎样一种欢乐。中国代表被抬起来了，来自朝鲜战场上的中朝人民英雄被抬起来了。人们狂呼、拥抱、许多人欢喜的挥着眼泪。是的，眼泪，这表现了人类多么圣洁的感情啊。我到过朝鲜。几年以来，我知道中朝人民为了胜利所付出去的代价，我也知道整个世界人民所贡献的力量。现在，就在我们联欢节的前夜，和平的敌人到底在我们面前低下头来了。
    布加勒斯特是座十分美丽的城市，到处开着红蕉、玫瑰、海棠和各色各样的鲜花。今天，这里更集中了全世界人类最美的青春，最美的理想，最美的希望。不论是在高楼大厦上，也不论是在五彩旗帜上，你到处可以见到用苏联文、中文、罗马尼亚文，以及各种文字写着这样的字句：“和平与友谊。”在大街小巷里，在共和广场上，也不论是在斯大林公园里，你到处更会遇见大群大群的青年男女，穿着各种彩色鲜艳的民族服装，胳臂挽着胳臂，一齐有节奏地拍着手，热情地反复喊着这句同样的话：“和平与友谊。”这不只是句口号，这是我们对人类生活最美的愿望。
    这个愿望，已经在地球上大部分人类当中实现了。从联欢节的每一角，我高兴我见到了整个人类的未来，世界的未来。一片彩旗，满眼鲜花，今天的布加勒斯特已经变成了花团锦簇的锦绣世界，满城洋溢着醉人的歌舞，青春的欢笑。这儿有从越南来的英雄，有从澳大利亚来的白发老人，有从非洲“黄金海岸”来的黑人兄弟，有从世界各个角落来的人民。尽管大家的肤色服装不一样，语言不通，思想信仰也不一致，尽管大家的来处远隔着重洋大海，森林高山，和平的信念却使大家的心永远相通，永远相连。这儿，不管你认不认识，每人都是最亲的兄弟，最亲的姊妹。一个五、六岁的罗马尼亚小姑娘会跑上来，握着你的手，含笑用中国话问：“你好？”一个从黎巴嫩来的青年会指着你问：“中国？”然后抱住你，吧?吧?亲着你的两颊。意大利人、比利时人、阿根廷人，会在街头包围住一个印度兄弟，争着请他签名。一个从埃及来的女跳舞家，耳朵上摇着好看的大耳环，会抱着你说：“中国就是我们的榜样。你们站起来了，我们一定也会站起来的。”我看见过，当越南的青年代表出现在群众前面时，法国的青年轰地拥上去，握手、拥抱、献花，最后还把越南的战斗英雄扛在肩膀上游行。我更看见过，当苏联的强大青年行列走进罗马尼亚“八月二十三日”广场时，全场的人都站起来，摇着彩色的手绢，发出雷似的欢呼，因为我们每人都知道，只有苏联才是和平的最有力的保障。
    黄昏，电灯一亮，音乐响了，满城的广场上都聚满了青年人，密密点点的，也看不清人的脸，只看见一片彩色的服饰，像是花圃里栽满的花草。人堆里，各国青年手拉着手，拉成一圈一圈，踏着急促的音乐节拍，转着圈跳。到处是花，到处是爱，不可想像人类当中还会有痛苦，饥饿，还会有屠杀。
    但我们决不会忘记在地球的某些角落，依旧存在着痛苦。我抱着黎巴嫩或埃及的朋友时，我的心感到温暖，也感到有点痛楚，我不能不想到他们人民正在遭受的灾难。罗马尼亚人民赶着修建了一座漂亮的白色大厦，里面展览了各国人民的生活照片。我见到了苏联、中国以及各新民主主义国家人民的伟大创造和建设。但在马来亚的照片上，我也看见一个英军，张着两臂提着两颗人头，得意地呲着牙笑。魔鬼！谁能允许这些血腥的罪恶沾污着人类的尊严？我们有力量取得朝鲜的胜利，我们也有力量能把这些罪恶从地球上洗涤干净。
    那一天，就是世界青年联欢节开幕的那天，罗马尼亚青年用身体堆成一朵美丽的大花苞。波浪式的花纹从花蒂一开展上去，那朵人的花苞便展开了，开出一朵红色的鲜花。这就是我们的信念。将来有一天，我们一定能改造世界，把整个地球改造成这样一朵大花，使全人类的生活就像今天的布加勒斯特一样，到处是花，到处是爱，到处是歌舞音乐。
    为着我们花似的生活，为着未来，我们决不惜献出自己的身体，来编织这朵大花。
