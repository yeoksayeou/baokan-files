Accepting the Lessons of the "Fake Thousand Catty Township" Incident in Youwu Township, Liling County

Editor's Note: This newspaper published an article on May 30th entitled "A Product of Subjectivism: 'Fake Thousand Catty Township'," exposing the fact that the rice in Youwu Township, Eighth District, Liling County, did not reach an average of 1000 catties per mu in 1952. The Secretary of the Liling County Party Committee, the County Head of Liling County, and the Eighth District Committee of the Liling County Party Committee have already conducted self-criticisms regarding this matter. The following are excerpts from their self-criticisms.

Self-Criticism of the Secretary of the Liling County Party Committee and the County Head of Liling County

After the People's Daily and New Hunan Daily published investigation reports on the "Fake Thousand Catty Township" incident in Youwu Township, the Liling County Party Committee and the Liling County People's Government immediately instructed cadres at the county, district, and township levels to discuss the incident in light of reality and to examine past work. On July 3rd, the Liling County Party Committee conducted further research, re-evaluated and revised the production plan for 1953, and decided to continue in-depth investigations from top to bottom and to launch criticism from bottom to top, exposing subjectivism and bureaucracy in past work, drawing lessons from them, and improving work methods.

The losses caused by the "Fake Thousand Catty Township" incident were serious, and the damage to the prestige of the Party and the People's Government among the masses was immense. It greatly weakened the Party's political and ideological leadership in rural areas.

How was the "Fake Thousand Catty Township" created? As the People's Daily pointed out, it was "a product of bureaucratic subjectivism." Indeed, Liling County had serious bureaucracy and extreme blindness in its agricultural production leadership work in 1952. When starting to formulate production plans, although we considered the difficulty in achieving the target of an average of 900 catties per mu required by the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and made some discounts, we still blindly formulated the plan without conducting a thorough investigation of the actual output of 1951. At that time, land reform was not completely finished, peasants had just received land, and still lacked means of subsistence (rations, etc.) and means of production (oxen, seeds, fertilizer, farm tools, etc.). The relations of production among various classes in rural areas had not yet stabilized. We underestimated these actual conditions and even failed to take into account the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, starting from the current situation of the small-scale peasant economy. We borrowed a set of methods from land reform, using subjective leadership methods and political mobilization slogans to vigorously carry out production campaigns, one "mobilization order" after another. We were satisfied with formalistic and unrealistic over-optimistic plans, giving the idea of some cadres being fond of boasting and eager for quick success a legitimate place, and randomly labeling peasants with "backward" and "conservative" ideas. Some of our leading comrades even said with satisfaction: "Conservative thinking is already illegal in rural areas." This prompted some cadres not to listen humbly to the opinions of the masses, not to study facts realistically, and to force the masses to formulate unrealistic high-yield plans. Some of our leading comrades not only failed to analyze and criticize these unrealistic high-yield plans but also greatly praised and promoted them, giving them excessive economic support. Conversely, plans formulated by some peasants based on reality were criticized by us as "conservative" and "backward." For example, at the county spring plowing production mobilization meeting, a labor model formulated a plan based on the actual situation but was criticized by everyone as "conservative" and "backward" and revised it three times. In the end, he felt that he really couldn't produce that much grain and was so anxious that he cried. In this way, unrealistic high-yield plans continued to emerge, and some of the masses echoed them; some people, although they knew it was impossible and disagreed, were afraid of being labeled as "backward" and "conservative," so they dared not speak up. The county party committee did criticize these erroneous things at the time, but because the county party committee itself had a serious subjective bureaucratic style, it did not fundamentally solve the problem, thus greatly promoting the erroneous idea of some cadres seeking credit, competing for numbers, and vying for praise in a way that was divorced from reality.

Another manifestation of subjectivism in Liling County's leadership of agricultural production last year was the requirement for peasants to produce uniformly, launching campaigns vigorously, treating the countryside as a factory, and viewing individual peasants as farmers of collective farms or workers of state-owned farms. For example, when accumulating fertilizer, "mobilization orders" were issued requiring men, women, old and young to participate in accumulating fertilizer, regardless of whether they had fertilizer or not; when eliminating locusts, the masses were mobilized centrally, regardless of whether the peasants were willing or whether the peasants had time; when applying ash to rice paddies, some cadres put forward slogans of mandatory orders that disregarded the actual situation, such as "advocating three applications, generally applying two, and not allowing one," but the county party committee thought it was very good, "vivid and powerful," and introduced and promoted it in the "High-Yield Communication." In this way, lower-level cadres engaged in coercive orders and even violations of law and discipline. For example, in the locust elimination campaign, an incident occurred in the first district where a district cadre beat the wife of a township head, and the second district even mistakenly put forward coercive slogans such as "If teachers don't catch insects, their rice bowls will cross the ridge; if merchants don't catch insects, their business will not prosper; if workers (handicrafts) don't catch insects, no one will invite them; if students don't catch insects, they won't be able to study." Township cadres in the seventh district used methods of tying up landlords and threatening the masses to force the masses to participate in locust elimination.

At the same time, we blindly believed that there were no problems, and we did not pay attention to strengthening leadership in the two evaluations and acceptances of early and late rice (county and district leading cadres and the vast majority of cadres participated in the "Three-Anti" and land survey and production determination). Therefore, cadres with bad work styles fabricated false figures and false reports below; therefore, fake thousand-catty townships and fake labor models appeared. Because the leading cadres had a subjective bureaucratic style and did not conduct in-depth inspections, such serious problems were not discovered for a long time. Individual members of the county party committee were even deceived by superficial phenomena, intoxicated by victory, and dissatisfied with the suspicious attitude taken by reporters and other comrades from outside. Even after the problem had been initially exposed, they still did not conduct in-depth inspections with an open mind. When preparations for spring plowing and production began this year, because of insufficient understanding of the central government's instructions and a lack of understanding of the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, some cadres still wanted to use the formalistic methods that had long been proven unsuitable, advocating the formulation of high-yield plans. Zhang Longhu, a comrade from the County Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, "helped" Ma Shizhao (a provincial labor model) in Dashuxia Township, Ninth District, to formulate a plan for a maximum output of 2,000 catties of grain per mu, and told him: "2,000 catties is no problem!" Chen Jinbang, a comrade from the Third District, saw that the Tang Qimei Mutual Aid Team in Shiwan Township had formulated a plan for an output of 1,600 catties per mu and said: "Do you all have conservative ideas?"

In short, our work methods and leadership style in leading agricultural production in 1952 ran counter to the Party's consistent fine tradition of linking theory with practice and maintaining close ties with the masses. It was a serious development of subjectivism and bureaucracy. If we do not correct and overcome it thoroughly, it will cause greater harm to the people's revolutionary cause.

On the other hand, since the investigation of the "Fake Thousand Catty Township" incident in Youwu Township was published, a small number of cadres and the masses have had another misconception, regarding everything in Liling County's leadership of agriculture in 1952 as wrong, even thinking that everything was fake. This view is also not based on facts.

Liling County achieved certain successes in leading agricultural production in 1952. According to the investigation by the Hunan Provincial Party Committee's inspection team in Youwu Township, although the Thousand Catty Township was fake, increased production was a fact. Cadre symposiums and old peasant symposiums unanimously believed that production increased by more than 10%. According to the materials inspected by the Provincial Party Committee inspection team in the Chuanxi and Hequan Thousand Catty Townships in the first and second districts, although the figures are different, these two townships were indeed Thousand Catty Townships. The reasons for the increased production were mainly the propaganda and implementation of the Party's policies, the vigorous organization of seasonal temporary mutual aid teams, the steady development of year-round mutual aid teams, and the promotion of the peasants' enthusiasm for production. Moreover, they seized the season, did not violate the farming season, helped the masses overcome various difficulties in manpower, economy, and farm tools, and overcame waterlogging, drought, and insect disasters (especially insect disasters). More importantly, they summarized Li Chenggui's high-yield experience and educated the masses with their own experience, thus improving farming techniques more universally. These are several basic experiences in Liling's leadership of agricultural production last year.

We should, on the one hand, carry forward the past advantages and absorb the existing experiences, and at the same time, take the "Fake Thousand Catty Township" incident as a heavy and painful lesson. All cadres in our county must accept this lesson with a serious attitude, sincere spirit, and realistic and humble attitude, treat it as a mirror, carefully examine their own work, thoroughly liquidate subjectivism and bureaucracy, and eliminate these work styles and methods that are divorced from reality and the masses without hesitation. We must learn the leadership methods and work styles of in-depth and meticulous investigation and research, from the masses to the masses, and combining leadership with the masses, striving not to make mistakes in leading agricultural production in the future, striving to produce more grain, continuing to lead the peasants to advance victoriously, and gradually moving towards socialism.

Secretary of the Liling County Party Committee: Zhao Fengxiang
County Head of the Liling County People's Government: Liu Deren

Self-Criticism of the Eighth District Committee of the Liling County Party Committee

In April of this year, reporters from the People's Daily and the New Hunan Daily learned about the production situation in Youwu Township of our district and discovered that the average yield per mu of the entire township did not reach 1,000 catties, and immediately discussed this issue with the District Committee. At that time, the District Committee did not take it seriously and did not calmly analyze the situation, nor did it conduct a realistic investigation into the actual situation. Instead, it believed that the masses in Youwu Township were trying to lower agricultural taxes, so they told the reporters that the yield was lower than it actually was. After the reporters left, the District Committee only conducted a simple study at the meeting, believing that there might be some problems with the yield of Youwu Township during the acceptance, but there would not be too many problems. The next day, Wu Quanyou, the secretary of the District Committee, conducted a superficial investigation in Youwu Township, and as a result, he still reported some of the subjective and arbitrary things of the past to the County Committee, and said: "If not 1,000 catties, then more than 900 catties." Later, when the Hunan Provincial Party Committee sent an inspection team to Youwu Township to check, Comrade Wu Quanyou and Comrade Nie Rengui, the head of the district, still stubbornly insisted on the old set of arguments. Looking at it today, the District Committee's past views on the situation and problems in Youwu Township were extremely wrong. We only regarded this as a numerical problem, and did not realize the extremely bad impact this matter had on the Party and the People's Government among the masses. When the inspection team came to inspect, although the entire District Committee did not openly resist, a small number of District Committees had resistance emotions, so the District Committee did not actively help the inspection work, which hindered the inspection work. The comrades of the Provincial Party Committee's inspection team and the reporters of the newspaper conducted in-depth and solid investigations from all aspects and repeatedly, and finally used materials from all aspects to prove that the average yield per mu of Youwu Township last year did not exceed 750 catties at most, which was one-third different from the number we originally reported, and it was also found that there was not a single real thousand-catty household in the entire township. After the fake thousand-catty township was exposed, it was supported by the masses. Only then did the entire District Committee begin to sober up, realizing that the past work was too blind and not in-depth enough, and that the subjective and bureaucratic work style was seriously harmful. Through the education of this fact, we made a preliminary examination of the entire work of the district in the past and had the determination to change our work style. Our preliminary understanding of the causes of this fake thousand-catty township is as follows:

In leading production, the District Committee lacked an in-depth investigation and research work style of seeking truth from facts, and was accustomed to vigorous campaigns, setting plans, making guarantees, and challenging competitions. We believed that production should be vigorous, and if it was not vigorous, it would not be possible to achieve high yields, turning the promotion of high yields into the promotion of "boom production." When treating rice borers in the spring of 1952, we mobilized the masses to light lamps, advocating as many as possible, and asking the townships for numbers; therefore, in order to satisfy our love of formalism, one household lit more than 100 lamps, but used small spoons. Nantangqiao Township (now Youwu Township) dipped oil on incense sticks and inserted them into the fields to light them, which was also considered "red all over the ridge"; Tangjiadu Township (now Meixiao Township) tied bamboo into torches, and each person took one and paraded on the road, the effect was not great, but we thought it "formed a mass movement." At the beginning of 1952, we blindly mobilized the Party and Youth League branches of various townships to formulate high-yield plans, stipulating that the Party and Youth League branches of Youwu Township should formulate a high-yield plan that "guarantees that the average yield per mu of the entire township will reach 1,000 catties, and the maximum yield will reach 1,500 catties," and issued a challenge letter to the entire district, the entire county, and the entire province, and called on the peasants in the entire district to universally formulate "thousand-catty household" plans. If that township or that mutual aid group did not challenge, did not respond, or did not formulate a thousand-catty plan, we would be very unhappy with them and criticize them for being "backward-thinking" and "conservative-thinking," and indiscriminately put the hat of "conservative thinking" everywhere. In this way, the peasant masses did not dare to reflect the real situation to us. The entire district, township cadres, Party and Youth League branches, mutual aid groups, and labor models had to challenge and compete for the sake of challenging and competing, creating an atmosphere of formulating fake plans. Fake plans were reported level by level, and when the autumn harvest came, in order to complete the task, everyone falsely reported high yields, and the District Committee was satisfied with these false situations. From 1952 to the spring plowing of this year, the leadership of production was blind. We were satisfied with the "liveliness" of last year's high-yield campaign, only willing to hear good things and unwilling to hear bad things; only willing to have high yields and unwilling to have low yields. Therefore, the District Committee could not see or hear the actual situation, was blinded by the false situation, and became a thorough bureaucrat.

After the New Hunan Daily published the news that Liling had a large area of high yield last year, the cadres of our Eighth District were very happy to see that the news that two townships in our district were thousand-catty townships was announced. Wang Zhenlv, a member of the District Committee, said: "There are 32 thousand-catty townships in the whole county, an average of two per district. We in the Eighth District also have two, and we have not lost to other districts. We are not bad, we have caught up!" But the masses said that the People's Government likes people with wide mouths. If they brag big, they will get a good deal and be able to receive government praise and rewards. It is indeed like this. When evaluating labor models after the summer harvest last year, the Yang Shenghua Mutual Aid Group in Donggang Township actually harvested 280 catties of early rice. He faithfully reported the actual yield, but the District Committee believed that this mutual aid group was good in all aspects, but the yield was too low and could not be rated as a model. (In fact, the high yields reported by other mutual aid groups were fake.) When building water conservancy projects in 1952, the county notified the district to formulate a water conservancy project plan, so we convened a township cadre meeting, and the district office made a form and distributed it to the township cadres at the meeting to fill in, asking each township how many ponds and dams they wanted to repair. This plan was not discussed and brewed among the masses at all, but was made by the township cadres based on their fantasies. The township cadres raised the opinion that "it is not practical for us to make plans in the district, we have to go back and make them." We insisted on making them at the meeting even though we knew they were not practical. After the townships filled out the forms, we added up the numbers and considered it a plan. As a result, only 40% of the district's water conservancy plan was completed. Especially in Huxia Township (now Shuangpang Township), two plans for large reservoirs were made. These two reservoirs had an area of ​​70-80 mu of farmland and required more than 20,000 workers. In order to repair these two reservoirs, the masses did not engage in sideline production for a winter, and their lives became very difficult this spring, and neither of the two reservoirs was completed, creating a situation of being unable to back down.

When accepting high-yield fields last year, the report written by the district to the county was: "After visiting and comparing, the entire district decided that Shenfugang and Youwu Townships were thousand-catty high-yield townships, and conducted acceptance." Obviously, we had determined in our minds that "thousand-catty township" was a thing of the past before the acceptance and acceptance was just "going through the motions." The representative fields accepted in Youwu Township were the best fields in each grade, and they were weighed on a rainy day. As the peasants said: "We cut it in the morning, dressed it up, weighed it, and it was a thousand-catty household. When the abacus was worked, it was a thousand-catty township." The figure of "an average of 1,001 catties per mu in the entire township" was created by Yang Houbin, a cadre sent to Youwu Township by the County Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, who insisted that the abacus be used, and we knew that there was a problem with this figure, but we never asked about it. Some peasants saw that "telling lies" was being praised, so they followed suit and "told lies."

The masses opposed the fake thousand-catty township, and it has long been rumored as "thousand-catty lies." We did not hear the reflections and calls of the masses, which is inseparable from our bureaucratic and subjective leadership style. Looking back on the work of the past, it can be said that it was done by slapping the masses in the face, issuing orders to the masses shamelessly, which caused serious damage to the prestige of the Party and the government among the masses. We deeply feel the pain. We fully accept and are very grateful to the Party newspaper for its criticism and education, and are willing for the higher-level Party committee to give us severe punishment. We are determined to correct our past mistakes, resolutely overcome subjectivism and bureaucracy, oppose false reports, oppose reporting good news but not bad news, closely contact the masses, learn from the masses, lead agricultural production well in the future, and be a good servant of the people.

    接受醴陵县攸坞乡假千斤乡事件的教训
    编者按：本报五月三十日发表了“主观主义的产物——‘假千斤乡’”一文，揭露了湖南醴陵县第八区攸坞乡一九五二年的水稻并没有达到每亩平均一千斤的事实。中共醴陵县委书记、醴陵县县长、中共醴陵县第八区委员会对于这件事情已经作了检讨。这里发表的是他们的检讨的摘要。
    中共醴陵县委书记和醴陵县长的检讨
    人民日报、新湖南报先后刊登了对攸坞乡假千斤乡事件的调查报告之后，中共醴陵县委、醴陵县人民政府即指示县区乡各级干部联系实际展开对这个事件的讨论，检查过去的工作。七月三日，中共醴陵县委又进行了研究，对过去的工作和一九五三年的丰产计划重新作了估价和修改，并决定从上而下继续深入检查，从下而上开展批评，揭发过去工作中的主观主义、官僚主义，从中吸取教训，改进工作方法。
    假千斤乡事件所造成的损失是严重的，对党和人民政府在群众中的威信的破坏是极大的，它大大地削弱了党在农村的政治领导和思想领导作用。
    假千斤乡是怎样造成的呢？正如人民日报所指出的，是“官僚主义主观主义的产物”。的确，醴陵县在一九五二年领导农业生产工作中是有严重的官僚主义和极大的盲目性的。开始订生产计划的时候，对于湖南省农林厅平均每亩产九百斤的要求虽然也考虑到难以达成，打了一些折扣，但仍然是盲目地订了计划，对一九五一年的产量究竟是多少没有进行确实的调查研究。当时土地改革没有完全结束，农民刚刚分到土地，仍然缺乏生活资料（口粮等），生产资料（耕牛种子肥料农具等），农村中各阶层生产关系还未稳定下来。我们对于这些实际情况是估计不足的，更谈不到照顾小农经济的特点，从小农经济的现状出发了。我们搬用了土地改革的一套方式，用主观主义的领导方法、政治动员的口号大轰大擂地搞生产运动，一个紧接一个地下“动员令”。我们满足于形式主义的脱离实际的过高的计划，使某些干部好大喜功的思想取得了合法的地位，乱给农民加“落后”“保守思想”的帽子。我们某些领导同志还满足地说：“保守思想在农村中已经是非法的了。”这就促使某些干部不虚心听取群众的意见，不实事求是地研究事实，强迫群众订出脱离实际的高额丰产计划。我们某些领导同志对这些脱离实际的高额丰产计划不但没有分析批判，反而大大地表扬推广，过分地给以经济扶持。相反地，有些农民从实际出发订出的计划，反被我们批评为“保守落后”。如在县春耕生产动员会上，有个劳动模范按实际情况订了计划，被大家批判为“保守”“落后”，修改了三次。最后，他觉得硬是不能打这样多的谷，急得哭了起来。这样一来，脱离实际的高额丰产计划就不断出现，一部分群众也就随声附和地搞起来；有些人虽然明知办不到，不同意，但怕戴“落后”“保守”的帽子，也就不敢作声了。对于这些错误的东西，县委当时虽然进行过批判，但因为县委本身就有严重的主观主义官僚主义作风，所以没有从根本上解决问题，因而大大地助长了某些干部脱离实际地争功劳、争数字、争表扬的错误思想。
    醴陵县去年领导农业生产的另一个主观主义的表现是要求农民生产整齐划一，大轰大擂地搞运动，把农村当成工厂，把个体农民看成集体农庄的农民或国营农场的工人。比方积肥时下“动员令”要男女老幼都参加积肥，也不管人家有无肥料；灭蝗时集中地调动群众，不管农民是否愿意，不管农民是否有时间；稻田插灰时有的干部提出“提倡插三道（次），普遍插二道，不准插一道”的强迫命令的不顾实际情况的口号，县委却认为很好，“生动有力”，在“丰产通讯”上予以介绍推广。这样，下边干部就发生了强迫命令甚至违法乱纪的行为。如在灭蝗中一区曾发生区干部打乡长老婆的事件，二区更错误地提出“教员不捉虫，饭碗要过垅；商人不捉虫，生意不兴隆；工人（手工业）不捉虫，没人请上门；学生不捉虫，书就读不成”等强迫命令的口号，七区乡干部曾拿捆吊地主、威胁群众的办法来强迫群众参加灭蝗。
    同时，我们盲目地相信没有问题，对于早晚稻两次评比验收工作，都没有注意加强领导（县区领导干部和绝大部分干部都参加“三反”和查田定产了）。因此，作风恶劣的干部就在下面造假数字、作假报告；因此，假千斤乡、假劳动模范就出现了。因为领导干部有主观主义官僚主义作风，没有深入检查过，所以这样严重的问题竟至长期没有被发现。个别县委委员甚至为表面现象所迷惑，被胜利冲昏了头脑，对记者和外来的其他同志所采取的怀疑的态度表示不满。及至问题已经初步揭发以后，仍未虚心地深入检查。到今年春耕生产准备工作开始时，由于对中央的指示领会不足，对小农经济的特点体会不深，有些干部还想搬用早已证明不适用的形式主义的一套办法，提倡订高额丰产计划。县农林局张龙虎同志在九区大树下乡“帮”马世昭（省劳动模范）订了最高每亩产两千斤谷的计划，还对人家说：“两千斤没问题！”三区陈金榜同志去石湾乡看到汤其美互助组订了每亩产一千六百斤的计划后说：“你们是不是都有保守思想？”
    总之，我们一九五二年在领导农业生产中的工作方法和领导作风，是与我党一贯联系实际联系群众的优良传统作风背道而驰的，是主观主义、官僚主义严重发展的恶果。如果不立即纠正，彻底克服，就会对人民革命事业造成更大的损害。
    另一方面，自攸坞乡假千斤乡事件的调查发表后，有少数干部和农民群众产生了另一种错觉，把醴陵县一九五二年在领导农业方面看成一切都不对，甚至认为一切都是假的，这种看法也不是实事求是的。
    醴陵县一九五二年在领导农业生产上是有一定成绩的。根据湖南省委检查组在攸坞乡的调查来看，千斤乡虽然是假的，但丰产了增产了却是事实。干部座谈和老农座谈，一致都认为增产了百分之十以上。从省委检查组检查一、二区的汆溪、荷泉两个千斤乡的材料来看，数字虽有出入，但这两个乡确实是千斤乡。增产、丰产的原因，主要是宣传贯彻了党的政策，大力组织了季节性的临时互助组，稳步发展了常年互助组，发扬了农民的生产积极性；并且抓住了季节，不违农时，帮助群众克服了人力上经济上农具上的种种困难，战胜了水旱虫灾（特别是虫灾）；更重要的是总结了李呈桂的丰产经验，以群众自己的经验教育了群众，因而较普遍地改进了耕作技术。这是醴陵去年领导农业生产上的几个基本经验。
    我们应当一方面发扬过去的优点，吸取已有的经验，同时把假千斤乡事件作为沉重的痛心的教训。我县全体干部要以严肃的态度，诚恳的精神，实事求是地虚心地接受这个教训，把它当作一面镜子，详细地检查自己的工作，把主观主义和官僚主义彻底地清算一下，毫不犹豫地除掉这些脱离实际的和脱离群众的工作作风和方法，学会深入细致调查研究的、由群众中来到群众中去的、领导与群众相结合的领导方法和工作作风，力求在今后领导农业生产中不再犯错误，争取多打粮食，继续领导农民胜利前进，逐步走向社会主义。

                             醴陵县人民政府县长  刘德仁
    中共醴陵县第八区委员会的检讨
    今年四月人民日报记者和新湖南报记者在我区攸坞乡了解生产情况，发觉全乡每亩平均产量是达不到一千斤的，立即向区委谈了这个问题。当时区委听了却不以为然，没有冷静地分析情况，也没有深入实际进行实事求是的调查，反而认为这是攸坞乡的群众企图降低农业税，所以把产量向记者谈得低了一些。在记者走了之后，区委只是在会议上简单地研究了一下，认为攸坞乡的产量在验收时可能有些问题，但也不会有多大问题。第二天，区委书记武全有到攸坞乡进行了皮毛表面的调查，结果仍是把一些过去主观臆断的东西向县委作了报告，并且说：“没有一千斤也有九百多斤”。后来，湖南省委派检查组到攸坞乡检查时，武全有同志和区长聂仁贵同志，仍然武断地坚持过去的一套说法。今天来看，区委过去对攸坞乡的情况和问题的看法是极端错误的。我们只把这当做一个数字问题，而没有认识到这个事情给党和人民政府在群众中造成了极坏的影响。在检查组来检查时，虽然整个区委没有公开表示抵抗，但少数区委对这是有抵触情绪的，因此区委对检查工作没有积极帮助，使检查工作受到了阻碍。省委检查组和报社记者同志深入地踏实地从各方面反复进行调查，终于用各方面的材料证实，攸坞乡去年每亩平均产量最多也不超过七百五十斤，比原来我们所报的数字相差三分之一，并且调查出全乡没有一个真的千斤户。假千斤乡被揭发后，得到了群众的拥护。这才使整个区委头脑开始清醒，觉悟到过去的工作盲目性太大，太不深入，主观主义和官僚主义的工作作风危害的严重。我们通过这一事实的教育，对过去整个区的工作初步作了一番检查，有了改变工作作风的决心。我们对这一假千斤乡产生的原因初步认识如下：
    区委在领导生产当中，缺乏深入调查研究实事求是的工作作风，习惯大轰大擂，订计划，作保证，挑战竞赛。我们认为生产就是要轰，轰不起来就不能丰产，把搞丰产形成了搞“轰产”。一九五二年春季治螟时，发动群众点灯，提倡越多越好，向各乡要数目字；于是，群众为满足我们爱好的形式主义，有一户点了一百多盏，可是，用的是小调羹，南塘桥乡（现在的攸坞乡）用香浸上油插到田里点着，也算是“满垅红”；唐家渡乡（现在的梅小乡）用竹子扎成火把，每人拿一把在路上游行，效果是不大的，我们却认为“形成了群众运动”。一九五二年初盲目地发动各乡党团支部订丰产计划，规定攸坞乡党、团支部订出“保证全乡每亩平均产量达到一千斤，最高额产量达到一千五百斤”的丰产计划，向全区、全县、全省发出挑战书，并号召全区农民普遍订“千斤户”计划。如果那个乡、那个互助组不挑战、不应战、不订千斤计划，就对他们很不高兴，批评他们是“落后思想”“保守思想”作祟；把“保守思想”的帽子到处乱扣。这样农民群众也就不敢向我们反映真实情况了。全体区、乡干部、党、团支部、互助组、劳动模范，只好为挑战竞赛而挑战竞赛，造成了订假计划的空气。假计划一级一级报上去了，到秋收时为了完成任务，大家就又假报丰产，区委满足于这些假情况。从一九五二年起到今年春耕，在生产领导方面都是盲目的。我们满足于去年的丰产运动的“热闹”，只愿听好的，不愿听坏的；只愿要高的，不愿要低的。因此区委对实际情况看不到，听不到，被假情况蒙蔽，成了十足的官僚主义者。
    去年新湖南报上登出醴陵是大面积丰产的消息以后，我们第八区的干部看到本区有两个乡是千斤乡的消息公布了，都很高兴。区委委员汪真律说：“全县有三十二个千斤乡，每区平均两个，我们八区也有两个，没有输给别的区，我们总算不错，赶上去了！”可是群众说人民政府喜欢嘴巴宽的人，吹得大就吃得开，占便宜，能受到政府表扬和奖励，的确是这样的。去年夏收后，评比劳动模范时，东岗乡杨生华互助组早稻实际收了二百八十斤，他很忠实地把实际产量报告了，区委却认为这个互助组各方面都好，就是产量低了，不能评为模范。（其实其他互助组报的产量高是假的。）在一九五二年兴修水利时，县通知区订兴修水利计划，我们就召开了一个乡干部会，由区办公室制下一个表，在会议上发给乡干部填，各乡要修多少塘坝等。这计划根本没有在群众中酝酿讨论，只是乡干部凭着脑子里的空想作的。乡干部提出意见说：“我们在区上作计划不实际，要回去作。”我们却明知不实际，也坚持在会上作了。各乡填了表，我们把数字加了起来，就算是计划。结果，全区的水利计划只完成百分之四十。特别是在湖下乡（现在的双滂乡），作了两个兴修大水库的计划。这两个水库有七八十亩田大的面积，需工两万多个。群众为了修这两个水库，一冬没有从事副业生产，到了今春生活发生很大困难，而且两个水库一个也没有完成，造成骑虎难下的局势。
    在去年验收丰产田时，区上给县上写的报告是：“全区经过参观评比，决定了神福港、攸坞两乡为千斤丰产乡，进行验收。”显然“千斤乡”在验收以前，我们主观上就确定了，验收只是“走走形式”。在攸坞乡验收的代表田，是各等田内最好的田，而且是在落雨天秤的。正如农民说的：“早上就割，割了就扮，扮了就称，称了就是千斤户，算盘一打就是千斤乡。”“全乡每亩平均一千零一斤”的数字是县农林局派到攸坞乡验收的干部杨厚斌硬要打算盘的人造出来的，我们明知道这数字有问题，也从未过问。有些农民看见了“扯白”（即说谎）受表扬了，也跟着“扯白”下去。
    假千斤乡群众是反对的，而早已传为“千斤白”，我们没有听到群众的反映和呼声，这是和我们的官僚主义、主观主义的领导作风分不开的。现在回想过去的工作，可以说在群众中是抹下脸来作的，是毫不知羞耻地向群众发号施令，使党和政府在群众中的威信受到了严重的损失。我们深深感到沉痛。我们完全接受，并万分感谢党报给予我们的批评和教育，并且愿意上级党委给予我们以严厉的处分。我们有决心痛改前非，坚决克服主观主义、官僚主义，反对假报告，反对报喜不报忧，密切联系群众，向人民群众学习，领导好今后的农业生产，做一个人民的好勤务员。
