People of All Countries Welcome the Korean Armistice
    Burmese Peace Committee Celebrates Korean Armistice
    The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace held a celebration meeting in Rangoon on the 2nd for the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. More than 300 representatives from all walks of life attended the meeting. Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, Chairman of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, delivered a speech at the meeting, pointing out that the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement was a failure of the imperialist policy of aggression, a victory for the people of the world, and a result of the continuous struggle of the Chinese and Korean people for peace.
    The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace also issued a written statement saying that the Korean armistice opened a victorious path for resolving international disputes through peaceful means and reduced the risk of a world war. The statement called on the Burmese people to shoulder the important responsibility of preventing war-mongers from opening new battlefields in Burma.
    The Burmese People's United Party issued a statement on the 1st, congratulating and expressing gratitude to the Chinese and Korean people for bravely preventing the American conspiracy to create a new war on the peace front. The statement pointed out that to solve the Korean problem, all foreign troops must be withdrawn, and the Korean people must manage their own politics.
    The "Han Chiao Yueh Li Pao" published a commentary saying that the Korean armistice shows that any major international dispute can be resolved through consultation. In the struggle for the Korean armistice, the Chinese and Korean sides demonstrated their love of peace. Now, although the armistice agreement has been signed, the United States is not happy with the armistice, and Syngman Rhee is still clamoring for war. Therefore, the people of the world should unite on the basis of the current victory and strive for greater victory.
    Iranian Peace Committee Holds Special Meeting
    The Iranian newspaper "Sha Chat Bao" reported that the Iranian Peace Committee held a special meeting for the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The meeting discussed the decisions made at the World Peace Council meeting in Budapest.
    The meeting passed a letter from Iranian peace advocates to the Iranian government. The letter said that the Iranian government should support all actions to ease international tensions and stop wars. The letter also asked the Iranian government to do its best to abide by the United Nations Charter, to defend the United Nations' principles of respecting international treaties and national sovereignty, and to strive to resolve the German question and other international disputes by peaceful means, and to develop economic and cultural relations between Iran and other countries. The letter concluded: "The Iranian government should not allow Iran to become a bridgehead for one country to attack another."
    Dutch Communist Party's "De Waarheid" Welcomes Korean Armistice
    The Dutch Communist Party's organ, "De Waarheid," published an editorial on July 28, welcoming the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    The editorial said: "For the realization of peace now, we must first thank the heroic Korean and Chinese fighters. Furthermore, this is an achievement of the strong peace policy of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. Finally, this is the result of the unwavering action of peace-loving people around the world to strive for a solution to the Korean question."
    The editorial also said: "The current situation requires us to be extremely vigilant, and we must do our utmost to prevent the aggressors from launching new adventures." The editorial said that with the support of all active peace fighters, lasting peace can certainly be achieved.
Tim Buck, General Secretary of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, writes
    The Korean Armistice is the Beginning of a Peace Victory
    On August 3, the "Canadian Tribune" published an article by Tim Buck, General Secretary of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, on the front page, entitled "Welcome the Korean Armistice - a Good Thing for Canada."
    Buck's article said: The Korean armistice brings joy to every democratic Canadian. It unfolds the prospect of solving problems through negotiation and achieving lasting peace.
    The article said: "The realization of the Korean armistice specifically shows that the struggle for lasting peace has entered a new and more favorable stage. Similarly, the realization of the Korean armistice is a serious blow to the American 'war group' and their Canadian partners... Despite the best efforts of war instigators, the armistice has been achieved. This fact assures us that the concerted action of peace-loving forces around the world can make the Korean armistice the beginning of a complete victory for the cause of peace."
    The article said: "The forces of peace must shatter the attempts to make the Korean armistice 'only a temporary pause in the fighting.' The Korean armistice is a very important step towards peace. The shift in the world situation has made it impossible for the American imperialist war-mongers to obstruct the realization of the armistice. This shift in the situation and the significance of the Korean armistice for Canada should become a central issue for discussion among the masses in the election campaign."
    Chilean People Celebrate the Victory of Peace Forces
    The Chilean newspaper "El Siglo" published many news items about the Korean ceasefire. The newspaper wrote: The Chilean people believe that the Korean armistice is a great victory for the Korean people, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the entire peace and democratic camp.
    According to news from "El Siglo," the youth of Santiago held a demonstration in the city center to celebrate the great victory of the peace forces over the war instigators in Korea. The demonstrators demanded that the Chilean government adopt a peaceful policy, abolish the military agreement signed with the United States, and establish trade relations with all countries in the world.
    Uruguayan People Hold "Korean Peace Week"
    The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Uruguay held a meeting in Montevideo to celebrate the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Gomez, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Uruguay, made a report at the meeting. In his report, he pointed out that the end of the Korean War made all peace-loving people in Uruguay feel very happy. He said: The signing of the armistice agreement is a victory for the forces of peace, a victory for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Korean people, and the Chinese People's Volunteers. It will help ease international tensions. Gomez further pointed out: The end of the Korean War proves that the forces of peace are growing stronger.
    The Uruguayan National Peace Committee also met to celebrate the end of the Korean War. The meeting decided to hold a mass rally on August 4. The Uruguayan peace advocates also announced that they would hold a "Korean Peace Week" in the week before the mass rally. During this week, extensive explanatory work will be carried out to people from all walks of life to publicize the great significance of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and to call on the people to be vigilant and strengthen the struggle for peace and against the conspiracies of war-mongers.

    世界各国人民欢迎朝鲜停战
    缅甸和平委员会庆祝朝鲜停战
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会二日在仰光举行庆祝朝鲜停战协定签字大会。出席大会的各界代表有三百多人。缅甸保卫世界和平委员会主席德钦哥都迈在会上发表演说指出：朝鲜停战协定的签订，是帝国主义侵略政策的失败，是世界人民的胜利，是中朝人民不断为争取和平而奋斗的结果。
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会还发表了书面声明说：朝鲜停战开辟了一条以和平方式解决国际争端的胜利道路，减少了世界大战的危机。声明号召缅甸人民担负起阻止战争贩子在缅甸开辟新战场的阴谋这一重大责任。
    缅甸人民团结党一日发表声明，对中朝人民站在和平前线英勇地阻止了美国制造新战争的阴谋，表示庆贺和感激。声明指出：解决朝鲜问题，必须撤退所有外国军队，必须由朝鲜人民自己来管理自己的政治。
        “罕礁越利报”发表评论说：朝鲜停战说明：任何国际上的重大争端都可用协商方法解决。在争取朝鲜停战中，中朝方面表现了他们热爱和平。现在，停战协定虽然已经签字，但美国对停战并不高兴，李承晚还在叫嚣战争，因此，世界人民应该在目前的胜利基础上团结起来，争取更大的胜利。
    伊朗和平委员会举行特别会议
    伊朗“沙查特报”报道，伊朗和平委员会为了朝鲜停战协定签字举行了特别会议。会议讨论了世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议所作出的决定。
    会议通过了伊朗和平拥护者给伊朗政府的信。这封信说，伊朗政府应当支持缓和国际紧张局势和停止战争的一切行动。这封信并要求伊朗政府尽力遵守联合国宪章，卫护联合国的尊重国际条约和国家主权的原则，竭力以和平方法解决德国问题和其他国际争端，发展伊朗和其他国家之间的经济和文化关系。这封信最后说：“伊朗政府不应当让伊朗成为一国攻击另一国的桥头堡。”
    荷共“真理报”欢迎朝鲜停战
    荷兰共产党机关报“真理报”七月二十八日发表社论，欢迎朝鲜停战协定签字。
    社论说：“对于目前和平的实现，我们首先要感谢英勇的朝中战士。再进一步说，这是苏联和人民民主国家强有力的和平政策的一个成就。最后，这是全世界爱好和平的人民坚定不移地争取解决朝鲜问题的行动的结果。”
    社论又说：“目前形势要求我们有最大的警惕，我们一定要尽最大的努力来预防侵略者发动新的冒险。”社论说：在所有积极的和平战士的支持下，最后的和平是一定可以获得的。加拿大劳工进步党总书记布克撰文
    朝鲜停战是和平胜利的开端
    八月三日“加拿大论坛报”以首页地位发表了加拿大劳工进步党总书记蒂姆·布克的一篇文章，题目是“欢迎朝鲜停战——加拿大的幸事”。
    布克的文章说：朝鲜停战给每一个民主的加拿大人带来了欢悦。它展开了以协商方式解决问题从而实现持久和平的前景。
    文章说：“朝鲜停战的实现具体说明争取持久和平的斗争已经进入了新的更为有利的阶段。同样的，朝鲜停战的实现对美国的‘战争集团’和他们的加拿大伙伴是一个严重的打击……尽管战争挑拨者的竭力阻挠，停战还是实现了。这个事实向我们保证，全世界爱好和平力量的一致行动，是可以使朝鲜停战成为和平事业的全部胜利的开端的”。
    文章说：“和平力量必须粉碎想使朝鲜停战‘只成为战斗的暂时间歇’的企图。朝鲜停战是走向和平的非常重要的步骤。世界局势的转变已经使美帝国主义战争贩子不能阻挠停战的实现，这种局势转变和朝鲜停战对加拿大的意义，应该成为在选举运动中让广大群众讨论的一个中心问题。”
    智利人民庆祝和平力量的胜利
    智利报纸“世纪报”发表了许多关于朝鲜停火的新闻。该报写道：智利人民认为朝鲜停战是朝鲜人民、中国人民志愿军和整个和平民主阵营的伟大胜利。
