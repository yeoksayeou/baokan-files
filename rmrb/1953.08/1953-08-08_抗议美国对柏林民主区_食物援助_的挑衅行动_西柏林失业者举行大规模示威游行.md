Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 5th: According to a TASS report from Berlin on August 5th: On August 4th, unemployed workers and pensioners in West Berlin held a massive protest demonstration against the provocative so-called "food aid" from the United States to residents of the democratic sector of Berlin and the German Democratic Republic. Protests and demonstrations took place on major streets in the western sector of Berlin near the areas where the U.S. was distributing food, at the West German employment agencies, and in Kreuzberg and Neukölln (U.S. occupation zone), and Wedding (French occupation zone).

According to the German News Agency (DPA), on the morning of August 4th, tens of thousands of unemployed workers in West Berlin held a protest demonstration on Reichenberger Straße. The West German unemployed workers and pensioners gathered here shouted: "We want work, we want to be fed!" The police brutally suppressed the demonstrators with rubber batons, without exception even against women and elderly pensioners. However, the enraged unemployed workers resolutely resisted the police.

At the same time, unemployed workers held similar protests and demonstrations on Prinzenstraße. They engaged in arguments with some residents of the democratic sector of Berlin who had been deceived by American radio propaganda and went to receive a trifle of American charity. As a result, those who received the food gave it to the unemployed workers and pensioners of West Berlin who really needed it. Seeing this situation, the supervisor of the aforementioned registration station quickly summoned a police team, attempting to disperse the unemployed workers, but without success.

In the afternoon, unemployed workers and pensioners in West Berlin continued to demonstrate and protest against the provocative "food aid" from the United States. Under the pressure of the wave of anger from unemployed workers in West Berlin, many American food distribution stations in the American and French occupation zones of West Berlin closed down.

Housewives and employees of the "Karstadt" department store in West Berlin held a large-scale demonstration on German Square in the Neukölln district. Participants in the demonstration distributed leaflets that read: "Don't flaunt American food here!" "Germany belongs to the Germans!" "Americans go home!" "Strive for peace and negotiation!"

According to the West German German Press Agency (dpa), West Berlin police arrested seventy-two demonstrators on the morning of August 5th who participated in demonstrations against the American "food aid" conspiracy.

    抗议美国对柏林民主区“食物援助”的挑衅行动
    西柏林失业者举行大规模示威游行
   【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社柏林五日讯：八月四日，西德失业者和领取年金者在西柏林举行规模巨大的抗议示威游行，反对美国对柏林民主区和德意志民主共和国居民的挑衅性的所谓“食物援助”。在柏林西区靠近美国分发食物的地方的各大街上，在西德职业介绍所，以及在克列蒲柏尔和新科隆（美国占领区）、维金格（法国占领区）都举行了抗议示威游行。
    据德意志通讯社报道，八月四日上午，西柏林失业者在雷溪柏尔街举行了几万人的抗议示威。聚集在这里的西德失业者和领取年金者高喊：“我们要工作，我们要吃饱！”警察用橡皮棍残酷地镇压示威者，对妇女和领养老金的老年人也不例外。但是，激怒了的失业者对警察进行了坚决的反抗。
    同时，在太子街，失业者也举行了同样的抗议示威。他们和一些受了美国电台宣传的欺骗影响而去领取美国的一点微不足道的施舍的柏林民主区居民展开了争论。结果，这些领得食物的人把食物给了真正需要食物的西柏林的失业者和领取年金者。上述登记站的主管人看到这种情形，连忙召来了警察队，企图驱散失业工人，然而没有成功。
    西柏林的失业工人和领取年金者下午仍继续在西柏林示威抗议美国的挑衅性的“食物援助”。在西柏林失业工人的愤怒浪潮的压力下，西柏林美占区和法占区的许多美国粮食的分配站关了门。
    西柏林的家庭主妇和西柏林“卡尔斯塔德”商店的职员在新科隆区德国广场上举行了声势浩大的示威。参加示威的人散发了传单，上面写着：“不要在这里卖弄美国食物！”“德国属于德国人！”“美国人滚回去！”“争取和平和协商！”
    据西德德意志新闻社消息，西柏林警察在五日上午逮捕了七十二个参加反对美国“食物援助”阴谋的示威游行者。
