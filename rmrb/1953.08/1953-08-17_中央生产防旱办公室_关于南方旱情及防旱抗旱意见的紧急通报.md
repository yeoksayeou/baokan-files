Central Production Drought Relief Office
Emergency Circular Regarding the Drought in the South and Opinions on Drought Prevention and Relief

    In the past month, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces have generally experienced little rainfall and dry weather, with approximately six million mu of rice suffering from severe drought, some of which has already become a drought disaster. The drought situation is currently developing, and efforts to prevent and combat drought have become crucial to achieving a good rice harvest.

    Generally, provinces and regions experiencing drought have paid attention to the issue of drought relief. The CPC Hunan Provincial Committee, the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Consultative Committee held a special meeting to discuss emergency measures for drought prevention and relief. They also dispatched leading comrades, such as the Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Committee and the Deputy Chairman of the Provincial Government, to lead working groups to inspect and promote drought relief work in various drought-stricken areas. The CPC Guangxi Provincial Committee, the Provincial Government, and organizations such as the Provincial Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation, transferred more than 300 cadres, led by heads of various departments, to various special districts to explain policies and specific practices, and to promote drought relief work throughout the province. The Secretary of the CPC Guilin Prefectural Committee personally led the drought relief work in a severely drought-stricken area, corrected the cadres' impatient and anxious mood in the face of the drought, delved into the masses to explore some experiences in organizing the masses to help each other and use water rationally, and developed and utilized various water sources such as rivers, ponds, wells, and springs, opening up the situation and strengthening the confidence of cadres and the masses in fighting the drought. In some areas of Changsha County, Hunan Province, where water conservancy conditions are relatively poor, the threat of drought has been reduced because they have tightened the three links of water storage, water conservation, and water use in advance. In Gong'an County, Hubei Province, through mass discussions, methods such as "using lake water first, then pond water" and "using pond water for upper fields and lake water for lower fields" were established to maximize the use of water, save seedlings, and ensure harvest. The main cadres of the Guangdong Provincial Government and agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments have also gone to the countryside to fully lead the masses in drought prevention and relief. The CPC Fujian Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government held a special meeting at the end of July to study drought prevention and relief measures, issued instructions respectively, and allocated 10 billion yuan from the Provincial Government to subsidize various places in building small-scale water conservancy projects, renovating existing irrigation equipment, and organizing handicraftsmen to help the masses repair waterwheels and purchase drought prevention and relief tools. At the same time, eight cadres at the level of department and division heads were dispatched from provincial-level agencies to lead working groups to various special districts to promote and assist the drought prevention and autumn protection campaign. Jinjiang and Nanping Special Districts have organized more than 1,600 cadres from special counties to go to the countryside. However, there are still many areas that neglect drought relief work, and cadres and the masses are paralyzed and waiting for rain. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen the leadership of drought prevention and relief work.

    In areas with severe drought, drought relief should immediately become the overriding central task in the countryside. All work that can be stopped or postponed and is not closely related to current agricultural production should be suspended or postponed in order to concentrate efforts on drought relief work. The main cadres responsible for leading agricultural production should personally study and analyze the situation, explain to the vast number of rural cadres the policies and specific practices for leading the masses in drought relief, and encourage and support all the efforts made by the masses for drought relief, so as to widely carry out mass drought prevention and relief movements. In areas where the drought situation is not yet serious, vigilance should also be raised, forces should be organized as appropriate, drought should be actively prevented, and full preparations should be made for drought relief.

    The main links of drought prevention and relief are to strengthen irrigation management, enlighten the wisdom of the masses, and find and develop local water sources that are easy to develop. Agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments at all levels and rural work cadres should lead the masses to establish or strengthen irrigation management organizations, implement organized and orderly water use, respect the good water use habits of farmers, and when necessary, consult with the original water users to obtain their consent and appropriately adjust the water volume of upstream and downstream or nearby farmland to rescue farmland that can be rescued, but compulsory methods cannot be adopted. Mobilize the masses to repair field ridges and ditches to reduce water loss and give full play to the drought resistance efficiency of existing water sources. Small-scale farmland water conservancy projects that have been washed away should be quickly repaired so that they can store water and irrigate in time. Guide the masses to establish temporary mutual aid organizations, repair and add water-carrying tools, and collectively help each other with waterwheels to rescue drought-stricken fields. Attention should be paid to implementing the principle of rationality and mutual benefit so that most of the members participating in mutual aid can benefit from irrigation. Members who do not benefit but provide labor or tools should be given reasonable remuneration to avoid anyone suffering losses. Existing pumping machines in drought-stricken areas should be fully utilized. Cities with conditions should support farmers in nearby drought-stricken areas with various pumping equipment.

    In areas where water sources are particularly scarce, simple and effective drought resistance experiences such as spreading grass, shallow hoeing, and carrying wet pond mud can be promoted according to local conditions to reduce water evaporation in the fields and maintain soil moisture; or watering seedlings by carrying water. For late rice seedlings in the South that are transplanted without water, methods such as entrusting seedlings and replanting can be adopted, and replanting can be carried out when the rain replenishes. Fields where rice seedlings have dried up and cannot be replanted should be changed to dryland crops so that no land is left uncultivated.

    During the tense drought relief campaign, relevant departments should provide farmers with practical and strong support in a timely manner. Now that early rice has been marketed in most areas, commercial departments and cooperatives should pay attention to the grain purchase and supply work in drought-stricken areas and supply farmers with urgently needed means of production. For farmers in disaster areas and those who have difficulties in production and life, they should be helped to carry out mutual assistance, production for self-relief, or given appropriate social relief. The People's Bank should issue a certain amount of loans as appropriate to solve urgent problems such as food rations in drought relief to facilitate the progress of drought relief work.

    Drought prevention and relief is an urgent and arduous task. It is hoped that the vast number of cadres in drought-stricken areas will mobilize together, go deep into the masses, lead the drought relief struggle, and strive for a good harvest of food crops.

    中央生产防旱办公室
    关于南方旱情及防旱抗旱意见的紧急通报
    近一个月来，浙江、福建、广东、广西、江西、湖南、贵州、云南各省，普遍雨水稀少，气候干燥，水稻严重受旱约有六百万亩，部分已成旱灾。目前旱情尚在发展，努力防旱抗旱，已成为争取水稻丰收的关键。
    各有旱象省区，一般均已重视了抗旱问题。中共湖南省委、省府及省协商委员会举行了专门会议，讨论了防旱抗旱的紧急措施，又派省委副书记，省府副主席等负责同志率领工作组到各受旱地区检查推动抗旱工作。中共广西省委、省府及省团委、妇联等组织，抽调干部三百多人由各部门首长带领分赴各专区交代政策和具体的作法，推动全省抗旱工作。中共桂林地委书记亲自领导了一个严重的受旱区的抗旱工作，纠正了干部临旱急躁、焦灼不安的情绪，深入群众摸索到一些组织群众互助互利合理用水的经验，并开发和利用了河流、塘井、泉眼等各种水源，打开了局面，坚定了干部和群众的抗旱信心。湖南省长沙县有些水利条件较差地区，由于事前抓紧了蓄水、保水、用水的三个环节，减轻了干旱威胁。湖北省公安县通过群众讨论，定出“先用湖水、后用塘水”，“上田用塘水、下田用湖水”等办法，达到水尽其利，救苞保收。广东省府及农林水利部门主要干部亦已大部下乡，全力领导群众进行防旱抗旱。中共福建省委和省府于七月底召开专门会议，研究防旱抗旱措施，分别发出指示，并由省府拨出一百亿元经费，补助各地兴修小型水利，整理旧有灌溉设备，以及组织手工业者帮助群众修造水车和购置防旱抗旱工具。同时从省级机关派出厅长处长级干部八人，带领工作组，分赴各专区推动和帮助抗旱保秋运动。晋江、南平二专区已组织了专县干部一千六百多人下乡。但是仍有不少地区，忽视抗旱工作，干部群众麻痹等雨，因此必须进一步加强防旱抗旱工作的领导工作。
    旱情严重地区，应即以抗旱为当前农村中压倒一切的中心工作，停办或缓办一切可停可缓及与当前农业生产没有密切关联的工作，以便集中力量，从事抗旱工作。负责领导农业生产的主要干部，应亲自研究分析情况，向广大农村干部说明领导群众抗旱的政策与具体作法，鼓舞与支持群众为抗旱所作的一切努力，以广泛开展群众性的防旱抗旱运动。在旱情尚未严重的地区，亦应提高警惕，酌情组织力量，积极防旱，并作好抗旱的充分准备。
    防旱抗旱的主要环节是加强灌溉管理，并启发群众智慧，寻找开发当地容易开发的水源。各级农林水利部门及农村工作干部应领导群众建立或加强灌溉管理组织，实行有组织有次序地用水，尊重农民的优良用水习惯，必要时可与原有用水户商量，取得同意，适当调剂上下游或邻近农田的水量，抢救可能抢救的农田，但不能采取强迫命令的方法。动员群众修补田畔水沟，减少水量损失，充分发挥现有水源的抗旱效能。对于已被冲毁的小型农田水利工程，要迅速修补，使之能够及时蓄水灌溉。引导群众建立临时性的互助组织，修补添置挑水工具，集体互助车水，抢救受旱田亩，应注意贯彻合理互利的原则，使大多数参加互助的成员，都能得到灌溉的利益，对于不受益而出劳力或工具的成员，应给以合理的报酬，不使有人吃亏。对旱区现有的抽水机器，应充分加以利用。有条件的城市，应以各种抽水设备支援附近旱区的农民。
    在水源特别缺乏的地区，可视当地条件推广群众中的铺草、浅锄、挑湿塘泥等简易有效的抗旱经验，减少田间水量的蒸发，保持土壤水分；或挑水点浇，保护稻苗。南方无水插秧的晚稻，可采取寄秧、补播等方法，待雨补插，稻秧已经干死而又不能补插的田亩，应改种旱田作物，做到不荒一亩地。
    在紧张的抗旱运动当中，各有关部门应及时给农民以切实有力的支持。现在大部地区早稻已经上市，商业部门、合作社应注意干旱地区的粮食收购供应工作并供应农民迫切需要的生产资料。对于灾区及群众生产和生活有困难的农民，应当扶助他们开展互助互济、生产自救或给以适当的社会救济。人民银行应酌情发放一定的贷款，解决抗旱当中口粮等迫切的问题，以利抗旱工作的进行。
    抗旱防旱，是紧急而又艰巨的工作，希各受旱地区的广大干部一致动员起来，深入群众，领导抗旱斗争，争取粮食作物的丰收。
