    Guaranteeing the Peaceful Life of the Korean People
    —"Pravda" Editorial, August 15th
    Today, the Korean people celebrate the anniversary of the liberation of Korea by the Soviet army from the shackles of Japanese imperialism. Eight years ago, the Korean people, groaning under enslavement, obtained the freedom they had long awaited and began to revive their national state and rebuild their new life.

    A brilliant prospect unfolded before the Korean people. The destroyed factories were restored and put into operation, and new factories were established in North Korea with the fraternal help of the Soviet Union. The democratic land reform distributed land to millions of farmers. The young Democratic People's Republic of Korea, while successfully developing industry and agriculture, also developed education, culture, and public health.

    The situation in South Korea was completely different. The American authorities, who occupied that part of the country, disregarded the wishes of the Korean people and established a reactionary regime of the Syngman Rhee puppet clique there. In June 1950, with the help of this clique, the aggressive forces launched a war in Korea, attempting to use force to impose the anti-national Syngman Rhee regime on the entire country.

    The bloody Korean War continued for more than three years. It took the lives of countless people and was full of crises that caused the most serious international disputes.

    The Soviet people and all peace-loving humanity welcome the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement with satisfaction and joy. People of all countries rightly regard the victorious conclusion of the armistice negotiations as a great victory for the heroic Korean people and the brave Chinese People's Volunteers, and as a victory for the forces of peace.

    The imperialist bloc participating in the Korean War of aggression hoped that they could quickly bring the Korean people to their knees. However, what actually happened was completely the opposite: they were caught in a fierce war, suffered huge losses in manpower and equipment, and completely damaged their military prestige. All this forced the instigators and organizers of the Korean War of aggression to abandon their plans and sign the armistice agreement. The just war of the Korean people against the interventionists and their henchman Syngman Rhee has proved that the struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland has made the Korean people stronger than ever and determined to fight to victory. Unyielding courage and heroism have been displayed everywhere on the front lines and in the rear of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    The Korean Workers' Party has integrated people of all strata into a unified camp. The Korean people, attacked by the most powerful war machine of modern imperialism, have proved to be invincible because they are fighting for a just cause. Progressive humanity will forever remember the merits of the glorious Chinese People's Volunteers who went to support the heroic Korean people.

    Peace-loving people have always regarded the Korean people's struggle for freedom and independence as an inseparable part of their own struggle for world peace. A powerful movement to defend the Korean people, to end the bloodshed in Korea and to peacefully resolve the Korean issue has been launched throughout the world.

    The will of millions of people demanding peace has become such a powerful force that the aggressors can no longer ignore it.

    Now that the armistice agreement has been signed in Korea, it is even more obvious that the notorious "policy of strength" used by the aggressors to implement their aggressive plans in Korea has suffered an undeniable defeat. Such a policy cannot resolve international disputes and is far from easing international tensions, but rather exacerbates them.

    The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement also shows that international disputes can be resolved through peaceful negotiations and agreements if the parties concerned abandon a policy of acting arbitrarily.

    The Korean armistice is only the beginning of a final peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The current task is to consolidate this major achievement in the struggle for peace. It is necessary to ensure that both sides strictly abide by the terms of the armistice, and then convene a higher-level political conference and ensure its smooth progress so as to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

    Everyone knows that the governments of the countries concerned should convene a political conference within three months after the signing and entry into force of the Korean Armistice Agreement. It is obvious that if the political conference is conducted on the basis of equality and mutual understanding and if both sides are sincere, the conference will be successful. This is the only way to achieve positive results, and all peace-loving people are looking forward to such results. What they deeply care about is that the Korean people should decide their own destiny without foreign interference.

    More and more reports in foreign newspapers show that the aggressive forces stubbornly attempt to worsen the international atmosphere and complicate the resolution of the Korean issue at the upcoming political conference.

    Recently, American newspapers published Dulles's statement. Dulles often expresses the sentiments of the most reactionary groups. This statement indicated that the United States intends to resolve the Korean issue in a unilateral way. This statement has alarmed people of all countries around the world, who are calling for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    The various activities carried out by the US State Department in concluding behind-the-scenes treaties with the puppet "President" Syngman Rhee have certainly attracted the attention of people of all countries. On the eve of the convening of the political conference to consider a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the US State Department announced a draft military treaty between the United States and the Syngman Rhee "government". According to this treaty, the US ruling clique intends to keep their troops stationed in South Korea indefinitely, although the armistice agreement clearly stipulates that the political conference should resolve the issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea through negotiations. From this treaty, it can also be seen that its signatories intend to expand the territory controlled by the United States or the Syngman Rhee "government" in the future. It is obvious that such a treaty is not based on a plan to consolidate peace in the Far East, but on a plan to launch aggression in the future. Those who oppose a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue are carrying out various conspiracies. For this reason, peace-loving people of all countries are raising their vigilance, strengthening their efforts to consolidate victory, and are becoming more persistent in striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and all other outstanding international disputes through consultation among the parties concerned.

    The Korean armistice has given the Korean people broad possibilities to build a peaceful life and restore the destroyed cities, factories, schools, hospitals, theaters and homes. The Soviet people sincerely wish the Korean people to heal the wounds caused by the war.

    Georgy Malenkov, leader of the Soviet government, said at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: We, the Soviet people, earnestly hope that the life of the glorious Korean people will prosper under peaceful conditions. The Soviet Union will help the Korean people heal the severe wounds caused by the war. The government has decided to immediately allocate 1 billion rubles to restore Korea's devastated economy.

    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, representing the will of all the Soviet people, unanimously adopted the decision of the Soviet government to assist the heroic Korean people in restoring their national economy. The people of the countries of the democratic camp will assist the Korean people, who have suffered so much, in rebuilding their peaceful life and restoring their national economy.

    With the fraternal help of the people of the countries of the democratic camp, the heroic Korean people will surely be able to rebuild their cities and villages, revive their economy and culture, and restore a normal peaceful life in a short period of time.

    保证朝鲜人民的和平生活
    ——苏联“真理报”八月十五日社论
    今天，朝鲜人民庆祝苏军从日本帝国主义的桎梏下解放朝鲜的纪念日。八年前，呻吟在奴役下的朝鲜人民获得了长久以来所期待着的自由，开始复兴他们的民族国家，重建新的生活。
    光辉灿烂的远景展开在朝鲜人民的面前。被破坏的工厂都恢复了并且开工了，在苏联兄弟般的帮助下，新的工厂也在北朝鲜建立起来。民主的土地改革把土地分给了千千万万的农民。年轻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在顺利地发展工业和农业的同时，也发展了教育、文化和公共卫生。
    南朝鲜的情况完全不同。占领这个国家的那一部分的美国当局不顾朝鲜人民的愿望，在那里建立起李承晚傀儡集团的反动政权。一九五○年六月，侵略势力借着这个集团的帮助在朝鲜发动了战争，企图用武力来使反民族的李承晚政权统治整个国家。
    血腥的朝鲜战争继续了三年多。它夺去了许许多多人的生命，它充满了引起最严重的国际纠纷的危机。
    苏联人民和全体爱好和平的人类以满意和欢乐的心情欢迎朝鲜停战协定的签订。各国人民正确地把停战谈判的胜利结束看作是英雄的朝鲜人民和英勇的中国人民志愿军的伟大胜利，看作是爱好和平力量的胜利。
    参加朝鲜侵略战争的帝国主义集团希望它们能迅速地使朝鲜人民屈膝。然而实际发生的情况却完全相反：它们陷入一个激烈的战争中，遭受了人力和装备的巨大损失，彻底地损坏了它们的军事威信。这一切的结果迫使朝鲜侵略战争的煽动者和组织者不得不放弃他们的计划而签订停战协定。朝鲜人民反对干涉者和他们的雇佣分子李承晚的正义战争已经证明，争取他们祖国的自由和独立的斗争已经使朝鲜人民比以往更加强大起来并且坚决地要战斗到胜利。在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的前线和后方，到处都表现出百折不挠的勇气和英雄主义。
    朝鲜劳动党已经把各阶层人民溶合在一个统一的阵营内。受到现代帝国主义最强大的战争机器所攻击的朝鲜人民证明是不可战胜的，因为他们是为一个正义的事业而战斗的。进步的人类将永远记得前往支援英雄的朝鲜人民的光荣的中国人民志愿军的功绩。
    爱好和平的人民经常把朝鲜人民争取自由和独立的斗争看作是他们自己所进行的争取世界和平的斗争中不可分离的一部分。一个保卫朝鲜人民、争取结束在朝鲜的流血与和平解决朝鲜问题的强大运动已经在全世界展开。
    千百万人民要求和平的意志已成为这样强大的力量，使侵略者不能再置之不顾了。
    现在停战协定已在朝鲜签订，侵略者企图用以在朝鲜实现他们的侵略计划的臭名昭著的“实力政策”遭到无可争辩的失败已更加明显了。这样一种政策不能解决国际争端，并远不能缓和国际紧张局势，而是使其更加恶化。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订同时表明：如果有关方面放弃独断独行的政策，国际争端是能够通过和平谈判和协议的方式求得解决的。
    朝鲜停战不过仅仅是最后和平解决朝鲜问题的开端。当前的任务是巩固这一争取和平的重大成就。保证双方严格遵守停战条款，然后召开高一级的政治会议并保证这个会议顺利进行从而达到以和平方式解决朝鲜问题的目的。
    大家都知道，有关各国政府应在朝鲜停战协定签字并生效后的三个月内召开政治会议。十分明显，如果政治会议根据平等与互相谅解的原则进行而且假如双方都有诚意，这个会议就会成功。这是唯一获致积极结果的办法，所有爱好和平的人民都在期待着这样的结果，对于他们来说，他们所深切关怀的是：朝鲜人民应该不受外国的干涉而由他们自己来决定他们的命运。
    外国报刊上越来越多的消息显示：侵略势力固执地企图使国际气氛恶化，在即将到来的政治会议上使朝鲜问题的解决复杂化。
    最近，美国报纸刊载了杜勒斯的声明。杜勒斯是经常地表达极端反动集团的情绪的。这篇声明表示，美国打算用片面的方式来解决朝鲜问题。这篇声明引起了全世界各国人民的惊愕，他们要求和平解决朝鲜问题。
    美国国务院在与傀儡“总统”李承晚缔结各项幕后条约的时候所进行的种种活动当然引起了各国人民的注意。在将考虑和平解决朝鲜问题的政治会议召开的前夕，美国国务院公布了美国与李承晚“政府”之间的军事条约草案。根据这个条约，美国统治集团打算把他们的军队无限期地留驻在南朝鲜，虽然停战协定明白规定政治会议应通过谈判来解决从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队的问题。从这个条约里还可以看到，它的签字者打算在将来扩张由美国或由李承晚“政府”控制的领土。十分明显，这样一个条约不是出于巩固远东和平的计划，而是出于将来发动侵略的计划。反对和平解决朝鲜问题的人正在进行种种阴谋，为此，爱好和平的各国人民正提高他们的警惕，加强努力以求巩固胜利，他们愈加坚持不懈地争取由有关方面协商来和平解决朝鲜问题与其他一切悬而未决的国际纠纷。
    朝鲜停战使朝鲜人民有广泛的可能来建设和平的生活，恢复被破坏的城市、工厂、学校、医院、戏院和家园。苏联人民衷心预祝朝鲜人民治愈战争所造成的创伤。
    苏联政府领袖格·马·马林科夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上说：我们苏联人民热切希望光荣的朝鲜人民的生活在和平的条件下繁荣起来。苏联将帮助朝鲜人民医治战争所造成的严重创伤。政府已决定立即拨出十亿卢布作为恢复朝鲜的遭受破坏的经济之用。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表全体苏联人民的意志，一致通过苏联政府援助英雄的朝鲜人民恢复国民经济的决定。民主阵营各国人民将援助受难如此严重的朝鲜人民重建他们的和平生活和恢复他们的国民经济。
    英雄的朝鲜人民在民主阵营各国人民的兄弟般的帮助下，一定可以在短期内重建他们的城市和乡村，复兴他们的经济和文化，并恢复正常的和平生活。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯）
