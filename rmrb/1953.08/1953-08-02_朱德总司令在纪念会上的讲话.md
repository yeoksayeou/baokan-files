Comrades:
    Today is the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st". Over the past 26 years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has traversed an extremely glorious path of struggle together with the Chinese people. Relying on this army, the Chinese people defeated powerful enemies at home and abroad and achieved the victory of the Chinese revolution. After the victory of the revolution, they relied on this army to consolidate the national defense, enabling our motherland to smoothly undergo democratic reforms and economic recovery and enter a period of planned and great construction. On this glorious festival, the people of the whole country thank the People's Liberation Army for its loyal service to the people of the motherland.
    Now, our motherland is beginning to enter a new historical period, and its task is to realize the industrialization of our country and gradually transition to a socialist society. However, we must never forget that our national construction is being carried out under the threat of imperialist aggression. Therefore, while building a strong economic force, we must build a strong national defense force to defend our motherland and the peaceful construction of our people. As early as March 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "In the historical period when classes have not been eliminated at home and the imperialist system exists in the world, our army is still a fighting force, and there should be no misunderstanding or wavering on this point." In September of the same year, in his opening speech at the People's Political Consultative Conference, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out again: A completely modern army must be built. He said: "Our defense will be consolidated, and no imperialists will be allowed to invade our territory again. On the basis of the heroic and tested People's Liberation Army, our people's armed forces must be preserved and developed. We will not only have a strong army, but also a strong air force and a strong navy." For nearly four years, we have resolutely implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, and our army has already achieved significant achievements on the road to building a modern and regular national defense force. We have built a fairly strong air force, navy, and various technical arms. Our infantry has also improved its equipment and enhanced its military quality on the original basis. After nearly two years of communist and cultural education, the political outlook of the troops has changed. The entire army is now undergoing unified and regular training, beginning the great historical transformation of our army from a low-level stage to a high-level stage. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has become a strong force for defending peace. Our army is capable of carrying out modern joint operations of various arms when attacked by the enemy, defending our motherland. Our Chinese People's Volunteers have also cooperated with the Korean People's Army to repel the aggression of US imperialism and achieved a great victory in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, which shows that the power of the Chinese people to oppose aggression and defend peace is invincible.
    The Chinese people love peace. We need a peaceful environment to build our country. The People's Republic of China has always pursued a peaceful policy of equal consultation and friendly cooperation in international affairs. The People's Republic of China will never invade others and resolutely opposes the aggression of others. Thanks to the unremitting efforts of the Chinese and Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world, headed by the Soviet Union, the Korean armistice agreement has now been signed. As long as the US government is sincere, the realization of peace in Korea is possible. Our task is to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and, furthermore, to strive for a peaceful settlement of various international disputes. However, in view of the fact that the Syngman Rhee group in South Korea continues to undermine the armistice with the connivance of the United States, and the rampant activities of US warmongers, we must still be vigilant. We must recognize the serious historical task on our shoulders and never forget to strengthen our own strength. The Chinese People's Liberation Army must continue to work hard, taking the great Soviet army as an example, and step up its own construction. We must accurately implement the troops' regulations, discipline, and orders, and consolidate and improve the army's discipline. Constantly improve military, political, and cultural levels, master modern military science and technology, enable each combatant to be proficient in the weapons in their hands, and each commander to become an expert in commanding modern operations, and be ready at any time to defeat the possible aggression of imperialist warmongers against us. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, all comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will live up to the expectations of the people of the motherland and strive to defend the motherland, the Far East, and world peace.
    Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
    Long live the organizer and leader of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    朱德总司令在纪念会上的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    今天是中国人民解放军“八一”建军的二十六周年。二十六年来，中国人民解放军在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下，同中国人民一起走过了极其光荣的斗争的道路。中国人民依靠这支军队，战胜了国内外强大的敌人，取得了中国革命的胜利。在革命胜利以后，又依靠这支军队巩固着祖国的国防，使我们祖国得以顺利地经过民主改革和经济恢复而进入有计划的伟大建设时期。全国人民在这光荣的节日，都感谢人民解放军为祖国人民的忠诚的服务。
    现在，我们祖国正开始进入新的历史时期，其任务就是要实现我们国家的工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会。但是，我们一刻也不能忘记，我们的国家建设是在帝国主义侵略威胁之下进行的。因此，在建设强大的经济力量的同时，必须建设一支强大的国防力量，用以保卫我们的祖国，保卫我们祖国人民进行和平建设事业。还在一九四九年三月，毛泽东同志就指出：“在国内没有消灭阶级和世界上存在着帝国主义制度的历史时期内，我们的军队还是一个战斗队，对于这一点不能有任何的误解和动摇。”同年九月，在人民政治协商会议开幕词中，毛泽东同志又指出：必须建设完全现代化的军队。他说：“我们的国防将获得巩固，不允许任何帝国主义者再来侵略我们的国土。在英勇的经过了考验的人民解放军的基础上，我们的人民武装力量必须保存和发展起来。我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军。”将近四年来，我们坚决执行了毛泽东同志的指示，我军在走向建设现代化正规化国防军的道路上业已获得了重大的成就。我们已经建设了相当强大的空军、海军和各个技术兵种，我们的步兵，在原有的基础上也改善了装备，并提高了军事素质，经过近两年的共产主义的教育和文化的教育，已改变了部队的政治面貌。现在全军正在进行统一的正规训练，开始了我军由低级阶段过渡到高级阶段的伟大历史转变。中国人民解放军已经成为一支保卫和平的坚强力量。我军能够在遭受到敌人侵略时进行诸兵种协同的现代化作战，保卫我们的祖国。我国人民志愿军也已经协同朝鲜人民军打退了美帝国主义的侵略，取得了抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利，这表示中国人民反对侵略保卫和平的力量，是不可战胜的。
    中国人民是热爱和平的。我们需要一个和平环境来建设我们的国家。中华人民共和国一直奉行着国际间平等协商和友好合作的和平政策。中华人民共和国永远不会侵略别人，也坚决反对别人的侵略。由于中国人民、朝鲜人民和以苏联为首的全世界爱好和平人民坚持和平的不懈努力，现在朝鲜停战协定已经签字，只要美国政府确有诚意，朝鲜和平的实现是可能的。我们的任务是争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，并进而争取国际间各种争端的和平解决。但是，鉴于南朝鲜李承晚集团在美国纵容下继续破坏停战，和美国好战分子猖狂活动，我们仍然必须提高警惕。我们必须认清自己肩上的严重的历史任务，一分钟也不要忘记加强自己的力量。中国人民解放军必须继续努力，以伟大的苏联军队作为榜样，加紧自己的建设。必须准确地执行部队的条令、纪律和命令，巩固和提高军队的纪律。不断地提高军事、政治、文化的水平，掌握现代军事科学和技术，使每个战斗员精通自己手中的武器，每个指挥员成为指挥现代作战的能手，随时准备战胜帝国主义好战分子对我们的可能的侵略。我们深信，在中央人民政府和中国共产党英明的领导之下，中国人民解放军全体同志必能不负祖国人民的期望，为保卫祖国保卫远东和世界和平努力奋斗。
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民解放军的组织者和领导者中国共产党和毛泽东主席万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
