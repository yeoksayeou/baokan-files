Chongqing Municipality: Forty-two large state-owned, joint state-private, and private factories and mines, as well as some basic construction units, under the leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, began rectifying labor discipline in early June, and some units have already seen results.

In educating about labor discipline, the factories, mines, and basic construction units, under the leadership of the Party Committee, organized trade union cadres to study the documents from the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions related to rectifying labor discipline. They also criticized the mistakes of trade union cadres who neglected the political education of workers and turned a blind eye to violations of labor discipline. At the same time, they collected good and bad typical examples among the workers and adopted methods of persuasion, education, criticism, and self-criticism to conduct vivid and specific communist education for the workers. When the private Shashi Cotton Mill rectified labor discipline, the mill's trade union first organized Wang Guofang, a worker who consistently observed labor discipline, to make a report to all workers and staff; at the same time, they appropriately dealt with Chen Jiafen, a worker who violated labor discipline and refused to mend her ways despite repeated education, so that the masses could learn from these clear contrasts. After listening to the report, Qinggong Fu Puhua, who previously did not observe labor discipline, automatically conducted a self-criticism, recognized and corrected his mistakes. Now, he not only does not absent himself from work, but also increased his yarn spinning from more than a dozen vehicles a day to forty vehicles, and took the lead in observing various rules. The attendance rate of Class B in the fine spinning workshop has increased by more than 10% compared to the past, and fourteen groups have automatically launched a production competition. The 704 construction site of the Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau, combined the dissemination of the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions with typical examples of work stoppages and waste on the construction site. It carried out communist education for the workers through careful accounting, making the workers realize the losses to the country caused by lax labor discipline. After reviewing the waste he had caused due to not observing labor discipline, He Mingfeng, a mason, said painfully: "If we had rectified labor discipline earlier, we would have reduced so much waste!" Now the construction site has established the necessary systems, and each group has incorporated compliance with labor discipline into the patriotic pact. Workers have high production enthusiasm. Bricklayers have promoted advanced experiences such as the double-hand mud squeezing method and the double-hand ash feeding method, and their work efficiency has increased by more than 40% compared to the past.

    重庆市各厂矿及基本建设单位
    整顿劳动纪律工作取得成果
    重庆市四十二个大的国营、公私合营及私营厂矿和一些基本建设单位，在中共重庆市委的领导下，于六月上旬先后开展了整顿劳动纪律的工作，部分单位已收到效果。
    各厂矿和基本建设单位在进行劳动纪律的教育中，都在党委会领导下组织工会干部学习了中国工会第七次全国代表大会有关整顿劳动纪律的文件，并结合批判了工会干部不重视工人的政治教育，对违反劳动纪律的现象熟视无睹的错误；同时在职工中搜集好坏典型事例，采取说服教育、批评与自我批评的方法，生动具体地对职工进行了共产主义的教育。私营沙市纱厂，在整顿劳动纪律时，该厂工会首先组织一贯遵守劳动纪律的工人王国芳向全厂职工作报告；同时又适当地处理了违反劳动纪律，屡教不改的工人陈家芬，使群众从这些鲜明的对比中得到教育。过去不遵守劳动纪律的青工傅普华听了报告后，自动进行了检讨，认识并改正了错误，现在，不但不旷工，而且，摇纱也由过去每天摇十几车提高到摇四十车，并带头遵守各种制度。该厂细纱车间乙班出勤率较过去提高了百分之十以上，有十四个小组自动展开了生产竞赛。西南建筑工程局七○四工地，结合传达中国工会第七次全国代表大会的决议，以工地上停工、浪费的典型事例，通过算细账对工人进行共产主义教育，使工人认识到由于劳动纪律涣散所带给国家的损失。泥工何明丰检查了自己由于不遵守劳动纪律而造成的浪费后，沉痛地说：“若早些整顿劳动纪律，要减少好多浪费啊！”现在该工地已建立了必要的制度，各小组都把遵守劳动纪律订入了爱国公约。工人生产热情很高，砖工们推行了双手挤浆法和双手供灰法等先进经验，工作效率较过去提高了百分之四十以上。    （本报西南记者站）
