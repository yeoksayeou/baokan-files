The thriving Ulan Maodao Pastoral Area
　　Bao Mucang
　　Getting off the Baihe Railway at Solun Station and heading west for about thirty li, you arrive at the Ulan Maodao pastoral area of the Horqin Right Front Banner in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Here, 503 Mongolian herding families live a settled nomadic life.

　　The Ulan Maodao pastoral area is a mountainous region. The large and small branches of the Greater Khingan Mountains run through the entire area. Accompanying those rolling hills are flat and long valleys with lush water and grass. This is where more than 500 herding families have lived and thrived for many years. Since liberation, from March to the end of October each year, most of the herders, except for the elderly and disabled who stay behind to take care of the village, drive their herds to distant pastures along the valleys. There, according to pre-arranged plans, they build yurts for lambing, shearing, and milking, to welcome the year's harvest. By late autumn and early winter, the young livestock have grown up, the cattle and sheep are fat, and people drive their herds back to the village one after another. At that time, sheepskins are drying on the roofs of every household, many families spread new felt on their kangs (platforms for sleeping), men are repairing willow carts, and women are busy making leather or cotton clothes. After the cold winter, people will begin the second year of nomadism again, welcoming the second year of harvest.

　　Since liberation, the livestock in the Ulan Maodao pastoral area has increased year by year. In 1946, the entire area had more than 22,000 head of livestock, which developed to more than 70,000 head by 1952, far exceeding the highest number before liberation—more than 54,000 head of livestock.

　　The development of livestock in the Ulan Maodao pastoral area can be specifically understood from the example of Baiyin Zhala Ga. Baiyin Zhala Ga is a village in Ulan Maodao. At the time of liberation, the entire village had 3,576 head of livestock, which reached 13,835 head in 1952. Most of the fifteen impoverished herding families with nothing have risen to the living standards of middle-class herders by 1952. The twenty-six herding families who were previously destitute (eleven of whom moved in successively) now own 4,727 head of livestock. During this period, the livestock of the herdowners also increased. Herdowner Amin Wuer Ta had more than 3,000 head of livestock at the time of liberation, which reached 6,965 head in 1952. The reason for the development of livestock was explained by Baoyin Heshige, who had worked as a herdlaborer for sixteen years. He said, "Since we have the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have learned how to manage our own lives. Now we have a herders' representative meeting here (with representatives from all classes) to discuss and resolve all major issues. For example, after the meeting in 1949 studied and formulated the mutually beneficial wage standards for herdlaborers and herdowners [note], the lives of poor herders have improved."

　　Baoyin Heshige is a hardworking and honest person. He had herded livestock for more than ten years in the past, but his family was still dirt poor. After the implementation of the mutually beneficial wage policy for herdlaborers and herdowners, he was still a herdlaborer, but his life was different. The wages of him and other members of his family allowed him to have five horses, thirty-six cattle, and two hundred and nineteen sheep in 1952, and he also built three earthen houses, bought a yurt and a wheelbarrow. Of course, he did not have to worry about food and clothing. Because of his hard work and fairness, he was elected as a labor model of the league and a people's representative of the banner. This wage policy also brought huge benefits to the herdowners. Herdowner Amin Wuer Ta's livestock had never exceeded 4,000 head in the past decades, but last year his livestock increased to 6,965 head. He said, "During the puppet Manchukuo period, we had to deliver livestock and were extorted by the police and the Kwantung Army; if the livestock got sick, no one would treat them. At that time, dead livestock carcasses were all over the village. Now the government helps us in every way to improve breeding management in order to develop animal husbandry...." Therefore, he boldly hired nine herdlaborers and actively managed the livestock. His herdlaborer Shedeng said, "In the past, we received too little wages, so we didn't manage them well for him. It's not like that now, we can go to the herders' representative meeting to discuss and resolve things."

　　The herders whose lives have improved feel that it is beneficial to organize. They felt that it was not convenient to manage their small number of livestock in large herds, and it would also bother others, and it might lead to quarrels. Therefore, they organized various types of mutual aid teams: perennial mutual aid teams, temporary seasonal mutual aid teams, and disaster prevention mutual aid teams. The number of households organized in this way accounts for about 24 percent of the total number of households in the entire pastoral area. The perennial mutual aid team of Erdeun Aoqi Er of Bayinzhalaga Village is one of them. The team was organized in 1949, and it was originally just a temporary lambing team composed of two households. Later, on the basis of voluntary mutual benefit, the number of members gradually increased, and by 1952 it had developed to eleven households, with 1,333 head of livestock, which could send out a yurt for grazing.

　　After the mutual aid team was formed, a problem arose, that is, the number of households was large, the livestock ownership was uneven, and a yurt could not use a lot of labor. What should we do? After research, they adopted a collective shareholding method. The method is that each share is roughly based on 300 sheep as the standard, and accounts are recorded and settled within the share. In this way, four shares were formed, and each share sent a laborer to work on the yurt regularly. All supplies on the yurt are shared equally by each share. Because they are organized, they not only solved the problem of carefully managing livestock, but also solved the difficulties of insufficient tools, insufficient labor, and inability to graze; they can also free up labor to engage in other production, such as lambing, shearing, haymaking, and working as perennial herdlaborers for herdowners. There are four such herdlaborers in the team. Due to the organization, the development of livestock and the improvement of herders' lives have been more guaranteed. Last year, they did not lose a single head of livestock.

　　With the rise of economic life, cultural and health undertakings have also been significantly improved. In pastoral areas, children are very precious. In the past, herders were reluctant to leave their children, and few people sent their children to school. Poor herders could not afford to send their children to school. Now this situation has changed. Many herders not only send their children to school, but also participate in literacy learning themselves. The herders of Haoli Bao Village have persisted in learning in the nomadic environment for nearly three years, and have sent eighteen children from the village to complete primary school. The current enrollment rate of children is more than 47% of school-age children.

　　In the past, diseases constantly threatened the lives of herders. Seven years ago, a disease outbreak occurred in Yao Deli Village, killing twenty children, nearly two-fifths of the village's population. The People's Government now uses various methods to educate herders to prevent diseases, transform old doctors, and organize medical clinics. Herders can ask doctors to see a doctor at any time, and can also get various vaccinations. The spread of general infectious diseases has stopped. No disease disasters have occurred in Yao Deli Village for several years. Now the population has risen to ninety-eight, of which babies under four years old account for one-third. This year, the People's Government has sent venereal disease medical staff to relieve the herders of the suffering of venereal disease.

　　The lives of the people in the pastoral area are improving day by day, but the herders have not forgotten the painful past, and they are even more yearning for a beautiful future. At a casual gathering at the home of Shedeng, an old man in Bayinzhalaga Village, I heard several herders talking about their lives. Shedeng compared the past and the present. He said: "In the past, the pastures were seized by the Japanese devils for military land, and tens of thousands of livestock were crowded on mountain pastures less than a hundred li in radius; now our pastures are eight hundred li from north to south and five hundred li from east to west, connecting to the border of the Mongolian People's Republic. After the autumn harvest, the masses in the agricultural areas also ask us to graze livestock in the stubble fields. In the past, unscrupulous merchants had to take away twelve catties of our wool to sell a piece of brick tea; now in the cooperative, three catties of wool can be exchanged for a piece of brick tea, and you can also buy cloth from Tianjin and porcelain from Jiangxi. In the past, people like us did not dare to go to the yamen; now the People's Government is ours, and we can often go to discuss things, and there are also representatives we elected as members...." Shedeng's nephew, Shedeng, a banner labor model, saw the lives of Soviet herders in a movie and was very envious. He said: "How happy is that! Everything uses machines, even milking uses machines, and wool is carried by cars. We still use wheelbarrows, which can only travel fifty li a day at most. ... We must produce well and improve our lives step by step."

　　[Note] The annual herdlaborer's wage is eighteen sheep, of which fifteen are ewes. The specific wage is determined by the herdlaborer and the herdowner through negotiation around this standard. The herdowner supplies the herdlaborer with clothing and food for all four seasons. Now the herdlaborers in Bayinzhalaga Village do not want clothes, but instead receive 160 catties of spring wool and 140 catties of autumn wool.

    欣欣向荣的乌兰毛道牧区
    宝木仓
    从白河铁路的索伦车站下车，向西走出三十多华里，就到了内蒙古自治区科右前旗乌兰毛道牧业区。这里有五百零三户蒙族牧民，过着定居游牧生活。
    乌兰毛道牧区是多山地区。大兴安岭的大大小小的支脉贯串了整个区域。伴着那些起伏连绵的丘陵，是水草丰美的平坦而漫长的山谷。这是五百多户牧民多少年来生存养息的地方。解放以来，每年从三月到十月末，牧民们除了年老残废的留下来照顾村庄外，大多数都赶着畜群顺着山谷移向远处游牧去了。在那里，他们按着预定计划，盖起接羊羔、剪羊毛的和挤牛奶的套包，来迎接一年的丰收。到秋末冬初，幼畜长大了，牛羊肥壮了，人们赶着畜群又陆续回到村庄来。那时候，家家户户的房顶上晒晾着羊皮，好多人家把新毡铺满炕，男人们在修编柳条芭，妇女们忙碌着做皮衣或棉衣。寒冬之后，人们又将开始第二年度的游牧，迎接第二年度的丰收。
    解放以来，乌兰毛道牧区的牲畜一年比一年增加。一九四六年全区有二万二千多头牲畜，到一九五二年就发展到七万多头，远远超过了解放前最高数量——五万四千多头牲畜。
    乌兰毛道牧区牲畜发展的情况，可以从白音扎拉嘎得到具体的了解。白音扎拉嘎是乌兰毛道的一个屯子。解放时，全屯有三千五百七十六头牲畜，一九五二年达到一万三千八百三十五头。十五户一无所有的贫困牧民，到一九五二年绝大多数都上升为中等牧民的生活水平。过去是赤贫的二十六户牧民
    （其中十一户是陆续迁入的）现在已拥有四千七百二十七头牲畜。这一时期，牧主的牲畜也有了增加。牧主阿民乌尔塔解放时有牲畜三千多头，到一九五二年达到六千九百六十五头。牲畜发展的原因，被一个作过十六年牧工的宝音贺什格作了说明。他说：“自从有了共产党、毛主席的领导，我们学会了如何管理自己的生活了。现在我们这里有牧民代表会议（各阶层都有代表参加），讨论和解决一切重大的事情。比方说吧，在一九四九年的会议上研究制订了牧工牧主两利工资标准〔注〕以后，贫苦牧民的生活都有了改善。”
    宝音贺什格是一个勤劳忠厚的人，他过去放牧了十多年，但仍然家穷如洗。牧工牧主两利的工资政策实施后，他仍然是牧工，但生活不同了。他以及他家里其他人的工资收入使他在一九五二年就有了五匹马、三十六头牛、二百十九只羊，还盖了三间土房，买了一个蒙古包和一台辘辘车。吃穿当然不发愁了。由于他的辛勤劳动和办事公道，又被选为盟的劳动模范和旗人民代表。这种工资政策，同样使得牧主获得了巨大利益。牧主阿民乌尔塔的牲畜，过去几十年来从没有超过四千头，去年他的牲畜已增至六千九百六十五头。他说：“伪满时期既要出荷牲畜，又要被警察、关东军敲诈勒索；牲畜患了病也没人给治疗。那时候，屯子周围遍地都是牲畜的死尸。现在政府为发展牧畜业，处处帮助咱们想办法改进饲养管理……。”因此他放心大胆地雇用了九个牧工，积极管理牲畜。他的牧工舍登说：“过去我们得到的工资太少，因此就不给他好好管理。现在可不这样了，有事可以到牧民代表会去商量解决。”
    生活提高了的牧民，感到组织起来才有益处。他们觉得自己少数的牲畜放大群，既不便于管理，又要麻烦别人，闹不好还得争吵。于是他们纷纷组织起各种类型的互助组：常年互助组、临时季节互助组和防灾互助组等。这样组织起来的户数约占全牧区总户数的百分之二十四。巴彦扎拉嘎屯的额尔敦敖琪尔的常年互助组就是其中之一。该组是一九四九年组织起来的，当时只是一个两户人家组成的临时接羔小组，后来在自愿互利的基础上，组员逐渐增加，一九五二年已发展到十一户，有一千三百三十三头牲畜，能出一个套包放牧了。
    互助组组成后碰到了一个问题，即户数多，占有牲畜不均，一个套包也用不了很多劳动力。怎么办呢？经过研究后，他们采取了集体入股的方式。办法是每一个股大体以三百只羊为标准，股内记账结账。这样凑成了四个股，每股各出一名劳动力，经常在套包上工作。套包上的一切用品，各股平均分摊。由于他们组织起来，不仅解决了精心管理牲畜的问题，而且解决了工具不足、劳力不够而不能游牧的困难；同时也能够抽出劳动力从事其他生产，如接羔、剪羊毛、打羊草，以及为牧主做常年牧工。这样的牧工，该组内就有四人。由于组织起来，牲畜的发展及牧民生活的改善更有了保障。去年他们的牲畜一头也没有损失。
    随着经济生活的上升，文化卫生事业也有了显著的改进。在牧区，小孩子是非常珍贵的。过去牧民舍不得离开自己的子弟，很少有人把子弟送到学校去念书。贫苦牧民则无力送子弟入学。现在这种情况变了，很多牧民不仅把子弟送进学校，而且自己也参加了识字学习。好力宝屯的牧民就在游牧环境中坚持了近三年的学习，并把屯里的十八名子弟送入了完小读书。现在入学的儿童为适龄儿童的百分之四十七强。
    疾病，过去时时刻刻威胁着牧民的生命。姚得利屯在七年前曾经发生一次疫病，死去二十名小孩，将近全屯人口的五分之二。人民政府现在用各种方法教育牧民预防疾病，并改造旧有医生，组织起医疗所。牧民随时都能请医生看病，还能注射各种预防针。一般传染病的蔓延已经停止。姚得利屯数年来没有发生过病灾。现在人口上升到九十八口，其中四岁以下的娃娃就占三分之一。今年人民政府又派去驱梅医务工作人员，为牧民驱除梅毒的痛苦。
    牧区人民的生活一天一天地改善了，但牧民没有忘却痛苦的过去，也更向往着美丽的未来。在巴彦扎拉嘎屯舍日德老头家里一个偶然的聚会里，我听到几位牧民在谈论他们的生活。舍日德把过去和现在作了一个对比。他说：“过去牧场都被日本鬼子抢去做了军用地，几万头牲畜被挤在方圆不到一百华里的山地牧场上；现在咱们的牧场南北有八百华里，东西有五百华里，连接到蒙古人民共和国边境。秋收后农业区的群众还叫我们在地楂子里放牲畜。过去奸商卖一块砖茶要拿走我们十二斤羊毛；现在在合作社三斤羊毛就能换一块砖茶，还能买到天津的布，江西的瓷器。过去咱们这样的人不敢到衙门口；现在人民政府是咱们的，能经常去商量事情，还有我们选出的代表当委员。……”舍日德的侄子、旗劳动模范舍登在电影上看到过苏联牧民的生活，十分羡慕。他说：“那多么幸福啊！什么都用机器，连挤牛奶都用机器，羊毛用汽车载，咱们还用辘辘车，一天顶多走五十里。……咱们一定要好好生产，把我们的生活步步提高。”
    〔注〕常年牧工工资为十八只羊，其中十五只为母羊，围绕这一标准，牧工、牧主双方协商决定具体工资。牧主供给牧工四季服装和吃的。现在巴彦扎拉嘎屯牧工不要衣服，代以春羊毛一百六十斤，秋羊毛一百四十斤。
