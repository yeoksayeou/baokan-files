	Daye Steel Plant Actively Carries Out Summer Hygiene Work

	This summer, the weather in the Yangtze River basin has been very hot, with indoor temperatures often around 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The Daye Steel Plant, located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, has many workshops without ventilation equipment, and the temperatures in the electric furnace, forging, open hearth, and rolling workshops are often between 130 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit. In mid-June (which was not even the hottest time), some workers suffered heatstroke and fainted, and the absenteeism rate gradually increased as a result.

	In order to prevent heatstroke among workers, the plant established a heatstroke prevention and hygiene work committee on June 19. The first step was to reduce the temperature in the workshops: electric fans were installed universally, and windows were opened. Based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, water curtain rooms were installed in high-temperature workshops such as electric furnaces, forging, open hearth, and rolling mills (iron pipes were installed around the room, with many small holes in the pipes; after water was poured into the pipes, the water sprayed out from the holes), allowing workers to take turns resting inside. Based on Soviet experience, the electric fans were also modified into misting fans (water pipes were installed on the electric fans, and the wind from the fans was used to blow the water out), turning the original hot air into cool air. At the same time, ice blocks were provided in the workshops to lower the indoor temperature. Secondly, according to the labor insurance regulations, high-temperature health care benefits were implemented for workers. Those who enjoyed health care benefits could receive nutritious foods such as bean juice, milk, eggs, cakes, and bread every day. From July 2nd, 1,800 people began to enjoy different health care benefits. In addition, each workshop was equipped with salt water and mung bean soup for workers to drink. Various necessary medicines were also distributed to workers. In order to maintain environmental hygiene regularly, a major cleaning was carried out once a week. Adjustments were also made to labor organization to allow workers to get adequate rest.

	After many aspects of prevention, the health of the workers at the Daye Steel Plant improved. The number of people suffering from malaria in June this year decreased to 5.64; the number suffering from dysentery decreased to 0.67; and no cases of typhoid fever occurred this year. For example, the highest absenteeism rate in the rolling workshop last summer reached 12 percent, but it had dropped to 4.5 percent in June this year. The number of people who suffered heatstroke and fainted in June and July also decreased by 42 percent compared to last year.

	Chinese Translation of the Novel "The Gadfly" Published

	The Chinese translation of the novel "The Gadfly" has now been published. This is one of the books that the vast number of Chinese readers have long desired. The novel is set against the historical background of the Italian people in the 19th century being oppressed by the Austrian Empire and deprived of national freedom and unity. It shows the patriotic men of Italy at that time rising up to carry out selfless struggles for the independence of their nation and the unity of their country. Through the image of the protagonist "The Gadfly," the author profoundly expresses the patriotic spirit and revolutionary enthusiasm of those men, so that this work is permeated with revolutionary heroism. The most excellent part of the novel describes the Gadfly enduring suffering and sacrificing heroically for the Italian people, and it magnificently expresses the Gadfly's fortitude, fearlessness, and his iron-like perseverance and hatred and contempt for the enemy, as well as his steadfast quality that is not subdued by any torture or abuse.

	The novel "The Gadfly," with its patriotic spirit and the vitality of its revolutionary enthusiasm, has educated and encouraged many young people. Gorky gave "The Gadfly" a high evaluation because of this, and the famous Soviet writer Ostrovsky also loved this book very much for this reason.

	Three Newly Built Suburban Film Projection Stations in Shanghai Are About to Be Completed

	The three suburban film projection stations built by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau in Jiangwan, Yangjing, and Beixinjing, which began construction in January this year, are now about to be fully completed.

	These three film projection stations are specially built to facilitate farmers watching movies.

	In the past, when projection teams went to the suburbs to show movies, the projections were often affected by climate, light, and other factors, and even had to be stopped halfway. Especially watching movies in the cold winter was very harmful to the health of farmers. These three projection stations are built together with the cultural centers in the towns and villages with a relatively concentrated population and convenient transportation in each district. The equipment in the projection stations is very complete. In addition to soundproofing and sanitation equipment, there are also eight ventilators installed on the four walls, which can regulate the air in the entire venue. The stage surface is very wide, and there are also dressing rooms on both sides. On both sides of the wide foyer, there are also two large, well-lit and well-ventilated rest rooms, specially for the audience to rest and read newspapers and periodicals. The two projection stations in Jiangwan District and Beixinjing District each have 788 seats, and the projection station in Yangjing District has 922 seats.

    大冶钢厂积极开展夏季卫生工作
    今年夏季，长江流域的天气非常炎热，室内温度经常在华氏一百度左右。位于长江中游的大冶钢厂，由于许多厂房没有通风设备，电炉、锻造、平炉、轧钢等车间的温度经常在华氏一百三十多度到一百五十多度之间。六月中旬（这还不是最热的时候），便有工人中暑晕倒，缺勤率因而逐渐增大。
    为了防止工人中暑的现象，该厂在六月十九日成立了防暑卫生工作委员会。首先设法降低车间里的温度：普遍安置各种电扇，开窗户；并根据苏联专家的建议，曾先后在电炉、锻造、平炉、轧钢等高温车间装置水帘室（室内周围装铁管，管上有许多小眼；在管内灌水后，水便从眼内喷出），让工人轮流在内休息。又根据苏联的经验，将电扇改装为喷雾电扇（电扇上安置水管，借电扇的风力把水吹出），使原来扇出的热风变为凉风。同时车间还备有冰块，以降低室内的温度。其次，根据劳动保险条例，对工人实行高温保健待遇。凡享受保健待遇的，每天可以领取豆汁、牛奶、鸡蛋、蛋糕和面包等富有营养的食物。从七月二日起，已有一千八百人开始享受不同的保健待遇。此外，各车间都备有食盐水和绿豆汤，供工人饮用。并普遍发给工人各种必需的药品。为了经常保持环境卫生，每星期进行大扫除一次。在劳动组织方面，也进行了调整，使工人获得充分的休息时间。
    经过多方面的预防，大冶钢厂工人的健康情况有了改善。今年六月份患疟疾的人数降低到五点六四；患痢疾的降为零点六七；患伤寒的今年没有发生。例如，轧钢车间去年夏天的最高缺勤率竟达到百分之十二，今年六月已降到百分之四点五；六、七月份中暑晕倒的人数也比去年减少百分之四十二。
    长篇小说“牛虻”中译本出版
    长篇小说“牛虻”中译本现已出版了。这是我国广大读者想望很久的读物之一。小说以十九世纪意大利人民处在奥地利帝国压迫下，被剥夺了国家的自由、统一的史实为背景，表现当时意大利的爱国志士起来为自己民族的独立和国家的统一进行忘我的斗争。作者通过小说的主角“牛虻”这个形象，把当时那些志士的爱国精神和革命热情深刻地表现出来，使这部作品浸透着革命的英雄主义。在小说最优秀的篇幅中，就是描写牛虻为意大利人民忍受苦难和英勇牺牲的部分，极其壮丽地表现了牛虻的强毅、无畏和他那钢铁般的坚忍力量及对敌人的憎恨、轻蔑，以及他那不为任何拷打凌虐所屈的坚贞品质。
    长篇小说“牛虻”以它的爱国精神和革命热情底活力，曾使很多青年受到教育和鼓励。高尔基曾因这一点，对“牛虻”有很高的评价；著名的苏联作家奥斯特洛夫斯基，也因为这一点非常喜爱这部书。
    上海新建的三个郊区的电影放映站即将完工
    上海市人民政府文化事业管理局在江湾、洋泾和北新泾三个郊区建造的三座郊区电影放映站，从今年一月动工兴建，现在将全部完工。
    这三座电影放映站是专门为便利农民们看电影而建筑的。
    过去放映队到郊区放映电影时，往往由于气候、光线等关系而影响放映，甚至不得不中途停映；尤其在寒风侵袭的冬天看电影，对农民健康有很大妨害。这三个放映站在各该区人口较集中、交通较便利的乡镇，和该区文化馆建筑在一起。放映站的设备很完善，场内除装置有隔音设备、卫生设备外，四壁还装置有八面抽风机，能调节全场空气。舞台面很宽大，两边还设有化装室。在宽阔的穿堂两侧，还有两大间光线充足、空气流通的休息室，专供观众们休息和阅读报刊之用。江湾区和北新泾区的两个放映站，各有座位七百八十八个，洋泾区放映站有座位九百二十二个。
