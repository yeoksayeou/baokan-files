    To welcome the "August 1st" Army Day, railway workers are launching a Red Flag competition.
    Reader Su Zhenshan writes: All the staff of the Fifth Work Zone of the Second Engineering Section of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways have launched a Red Flag competition to welcome "August 1st" Army Day. After the competition began, the technical personnel guaranteed to cooperate with the construction site and not delay the construction plan. They went to the construction site at five o'clock every morning and did not finish work until nine o'clock in the evening. Management personnel also went deep into the construction site to help with work. The workers' families also brought drinking water to the construction site from six or seven miles away and participated in the work. The workers' slogan is: "Repay the soldiers for the happiness they gave us with their blood!" In addition to working actively, the workers also used their brains to find tricks. During this period, Li Ruilin invented the "double-fuse low-middle two-part blasting method". Bian Jianping improved the "three-layer gray paper fuse". Tian Shi also made improvements to the blasting method, which increased work efficiency by 20%. Originally, the stone-smashing team used eighteen workers to smash one cubic meter per day, but after finding a trick, eight workers can now smash one cubic meter per day, increasing the efficiency by more than double. Now, in addition to completing the competition plan, the workers are using their spare time to rehearse plays, preparing to perform on "August 1st" to comfort the families of revolutionary martyrs.

    为了迎接“八一”铁道职工开展红旗竞赛
    读者苏振山来信：铁道部第三工程局第二工程段第五工区的全体工作人员，为迎接“八一”建军节开展了红旗竞赛。竞赛开始后，技术人员们保证配合工地施工，不耽误施工计划，每天早晨五点钟就到工地工作，直到下午九时才收工。管理人员也深入工地，帮助工作。职工家属们，也从六、七里地外送饮水到工地，并且参加工作。工人们的口号是：“报答战士们用鲜血给我们换来的幸福！”工人们积极工作之外，还开动脑筋找窍门。这期间，李瑞麟发明了“双焾低中两部放炮爆炸法”。卞建平改进了“三层灰纸保险焾”。还有田仕对爆炸法的改进，使工作效率提高了百分之二十。原来，砸石头的小队，每天十八个工砸一方，找了窍门后每天八个工就可以砸一方，提高了一倍多。现在职工们除了完成竞赛计划外，正利用空闲时间排戏，准备在“八一”这天演出，慰问烈军属。
