Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 8th: On August 8th, the Korean-Chinese side repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war and 250 Korean prisoners of war to the enemy, for a total of 400. Among the non-Korean prisoners of war, there were 90 American, 35 Turkish, and 25 British. The enemy repatriated 1,798 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and 960 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers to our side, including 360 wounded and sick personnel.

At 12:00 noon today, when the enemy's ninth batch of trucks arrived at our side's transfer area, one captured soldier of the Korean People's Army had already died. The enemy immediately transported the body away in the truck and informed our side that Korean People's Army captured soldier Choi Young-soo (number 54043) should be removed from the repatriation list. According to convention, trucks do not carry wounded or sick prisoners of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 8th: At the staff meeting between the two sides on the 6th, the US staff handed over to our side 18 thick volumes of the death list of Korean-Chinese captured personnel. This list, from the beginning of the American invasion of Korea to July 24th of this year, contains the names of 8,418 deceased. The enemy also submitted to our side a death list from July 25th to August 3rd, including 22 people. These two death lists of Korean-Chinese captured personnel provided by the US side officially constitute a shockingly large number.

However, this alarming number has obviously been greatly reduced. According to an Associated Press report from Geneva on November 29, 1952, based on investigations by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the total number of deaths of Korean-Chinese captured personnel from the beginning of the American invasion of Korea to the end of 1951 had already reached 13,814. At the same time, according to reports from American and British news agencies, inspection reports from the International Committee of the Red Cross, accusations from returned captured personnel from our side, and confessions from captured airborne secret agents from our side, from June 1951 to June of this year alone, the US side killed or wounded more than 6,500 captured personnel from our side, including 3,161 killed. Obviously, these two figures are not the final and complete figures either. Until recently, the bloody massacres in US prisoner-of-war camps have not stopped. In just three days, from July 27th to 29th, in Camp No. 14 on Geoje Island, the US side used machine guns, grenades, gas bombs, and bayonets to kill 14 captured personnel from our side who insisted on repatriation, and seriously injured more than 200 people.

### 朝中方面和对方八月八日继续遣返战俘  美方送来我被俘人员死亡名单怵目惊心

    朝中方面和对方八月八日继续遣返战俘
    美方送来我被俘人员死亡名单怵目惊心
    【新华社开城八日电】八月八日朝中方面遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百五十人，朝鲜籍战俘二百五十人，总数为四百人。在非朝鲜籍战俘中，有美国籍九十人，土耳其籍三十五人，英国籍二十五人。对方遣返给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员一千七百九十八人，中国人民志愿军被俘人员九百六十人，其中有三百六十名伤病人员。
    今天上午十二时，对方的第九批卡车到达我方交接区时，车上有一名朝鲜人民军被俘人员已经死去。对方随即将卡车上的尸体运走，并通知我方在遣返接收名单上须除去朝鲜人民军被俘人员崔荣守
    （编号五四零四三）一名。按照惯例，卡车是不载运伤病战俘的。
    【新华社开城八日电】六日双方参谋会议上，美方参谋送交我方十八厚册朝中被俘人员的死亡名单。这份从美国侵朝战争开始到今年七月二十四日为止的名单中，死亡者共有八千四百一十八人。对方同时送交我方一份从七月二十五日到八月三日的死亡名单，包括二十二人。这两份由美方官方提供的朝中被俘人员的死亡名单，构成了一个令人触目惊心的庞大数字。
    但是，这个惊人的数字显然已被大大削减过。据美联社一九五二年十一月二十九日发自日内瓦的报道，根据红十字国际委员会的调查，从美国侵朝战争开始到一九五一年年底为止，朝中被俘人员的死亡总数就已达一万三千八百一十四人。同时，根据美、英通讯社的报道、红十字国际委员会的视察报告、归来的我方被俘人员的控诉和我方捕获的空降特务的供词等材料统计，自一九五一年六月到今年六月为止，仅被美方打死打伤我方被俘人员就有六千五百多人，其中被打死的共三千一百六十一人。显然，这两个数字也并不是最后的和完全的数字。直到最近为止，美方战俘营中的血腥屠杀仍未停止。仅仅在七月二十七日到二十九日的三天内，美方在巨济岛第十四号营场内，就用机枪、手榴弹、毒气弹和刺刀打死坚持遣返的我方被俘人员十四人，重伤二百多人。
