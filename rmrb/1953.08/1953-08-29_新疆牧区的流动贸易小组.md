    Mobile Trade Teams in Xinjiang Pastoral Areas
    Su Bo
    In the westernmost part of our motherland lies a vast and fertile natural pasture, the famous pastoral areas of the Tianshan, Altai, and Pamir Mountains. Scattered in these areas are over 600,000 herdsmen of the Kazakh, Mongolian, Kyrgyz, Tajik, and other ethnic groups, herding many cattle and sheep on the boundless and lush grasslands.

    The wool, leather, ghee, and meat produced in various pastoral areas, in addition to meeting the needs of the people on the grasslands, are also sold in large quantities every year. After liberation, every autumn when the grass is lush and the livestock are strong, the state-owned trading departments of Xinjiang Province organize mobile trade teams with members from the Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, Kyrgyz, Tajik, and other ethnic groups, carrying large quantities of tea, sugar, and cloth to go deep into the pastoral areas for purchasing and sales.

    This year, the Xinjiang state-owned trading department plans to increase the amount of wool purchased by 167 percent compared to last year, and the amount of cattle and horse hides purchased by 35 percent compared to last year. The purchase volume of camel hair, sheep casings, and other livestock products has also increased compared to last year. Hundreds of mobile trade teams have now entered the vast pastoral areas. In order to increase wool production and maintain wool quality and fat content, herdsmen have built shearing enclosures and sheds to avoid wind and rain during shearing. Some herdsmen, fearing that shearing on the ground would affect quality, spread mats on the ground. The herdsmen have prepared the best livestock products to exchange for their favorite daily necessities.

    The staff of the mobile trade teams have demonstrated a spirit of serving the people of all ethnic groups everywhere, and are welcomed and loved by the herdsmen everywhere. Here, let me introduce the Rehe Mandula team, which is active in the Altai Mountain pastoral area all year round. In the past, the biggest difficulty for the people in the Altai Mountain pastoral area was that they could not sell their livestock products and could not buy the production and living materials they needed. Since Rehe Mandula and the mobile trade team he led went deep there, the situation has completely changed. The Rehe Mandula team has a total of four people. They carefully investigate the needs of the local people and meet the needs of the masses in a timely manner. Last August, the herdsmen in the Alahake area lacked tea. After Rehe Mandula learned about this, he overcame various difficulties and delivered the tea to the yurts in the Alahake area. In the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius, the hands of Rehe Mandula and his team members were so frozen that they could not hold things, but they still insisted on working. Once, they transported goods from Chenghua to Asumubayi Village. On the way, it was about to rain, and the tea, cloth, sugar, paper, etc. loaded on the camels were all afraid of getting wet. Rehe Mandula and another team member drove the camels into the woods and endured hunger, cold, and fatigue overnight, so that the goods were intact. These facts moved the local herdsmen. They called the Rehe Mandula team a team sent by the Communist Party to serve the people. The herdsmen in Alahake area automatically built two houses with glass windows for them, so that they could have a better business place; the herdsmen in Kekexun area also voluntarily gave up two houses, allowing two members of the Rehe Mandula team to live there permanently. In February of this year, the Rehe Mandula team wanted to go to Tacheng to transport goods and lacked camels. The local herdsmen spontaneously organized 87 camels to help them overcome the difficulties.

    The staff of the mobile trade teams not only carried out purchasing and sales business in the pastoral areas, but also frequently publicized the policies of the Party and the People's Government, thereby enhancing the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the herdsmen. When trade cadres in the Keping pastoral area purchased wool, they promoted the principles of patriotism and livestock protection to the herdsmen. The local masses proposed one after another: "Grow more pasture, and ensure that cattle are strong and sheep are fat." The cadres of the mobile trade team in the Zhenxi pastoral area promoted and implemented the policy of "grading and pricing" during the purchase, which greatly improved the purity of the wool.

    In the past few years, the mobile trade teams that have gone deep into the pastoral areas have all implemented the country's fair and reasonable price policy, which has brought about significant changes in the exchange parity of commodities in the pastoral areas. The prices of local and special products have increased, and the prices of imported daily necessities have decreased. In 1949, 340 jin of wool could only be exchanged for one bolt of Yanta cloth, but last year only 54 jin could be exchanged for one bolt; in 1949, 100 sheepskins could only be exchanged for 8.3 bricks of tea, but now they can be exchanged for 60 bricks. At present, the prices of various local and special products have increased by an average of eight times compared to 1949.

    The change in the exchange parity of products has brought happiness to the people on the grasslands; the economic life of the herdsmen has improved, and production has developed. The change in the purchasing power of the Tajik people in the first township of the third district of Puli County is a specific example. In 1949, the average purchasing power of each herdsman in this township was only 41,028 yuan; by 1952, the average purchasing power of each herdsman had increased to 131,413 yuan. In 1949, each person could only buy 0.1 dangzi (1 dangzi equals 2 chi) of printed cloth on average; by 1952, each person could buy 2.5 dangzi of printed cloth on average. In the vast pastoral areas, herdsmen who had no yurts in the past or only had dilapidated yurts have now made new yurts. Many herdsmen who could not afford new clothes in the past are now making new clothes one after another. Herdsmen who could only eat ghee and highland barley flour in the past can now eat white flour. Some herdsmen who lived in yurts all year round have built houses, and some houses have even been fitted with glass windows. In the homes of the herdsmen, portraits of Chairman Mao and pictures loved by people of all ethnic groups are hung. People of all ethnic groups love Chairman Mao and the People's Government. They gratefully praised Chairman Mao as the "red sun." There is a Mongolian herdsman in Hejing County named Yi Renqie, who is over 60 years old this year. Because he was afraid that the Kuomintang would conscript laborers to build roads, he had not left the mountains for more than 20 years; last year, he exchanged a horse hide for ten packs of matches and a pack of sugar from the mobile trade team for the first time. He excitedly called Chairman Mao a "real living Buddha."

    新疆牧区的流动贸易小组
    苏波
    在我们祖国的最西边，有着辽阔而丰美的天然牧场，这便是著名的天山、阿尔泰山和帕米尔高原牧区。散布在这些地方的哈萨克、蒙古、柯尔克孜、塔吉克等民族的六十多万牧民，他们赶着许多牛羊，在一望无垠的牧草肥美的草地上牧放。
    各个牧区出产的羊毛、皮革、酥油和肉类，除了供草原上人民的需用以外，每年还大量外销。解放后，每当草肥畜壮的秋季来临时，新疆省国营贸易部门便组成有维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古、柯尔克孜、塔吉克等各民族成员参加的流动贸易小组，携带着大量茶、糖、布匹，深入牧区进行收购和推销。
    今年新疆国营贸易部门计划收购羊毛的数量，比去年增加了百分之一百六十七，收购牛马皮张的数量，比去年增加百分之三十五，驼毛、羊肠等畜产的收购量比去年也有增加。现在数百个流动贸易小组，已进入广大牧区。牧民们为了增加毛的产量并保持毛的质量和含脂量，他们在剪毛时，搭盖了剪毛圈和剪毛棚，以避免风雨的侵蚀。有的牧民怕在地上剪毛影响质量，就在地上铺上席子。牧民们都准备了最好的畜产，拿来交换自己喜爱的日用品。
    流动贸易小组的工作人员，处处发挥了为各族人民服务的精神，到处受到牧民的欢迎和爱护。在这里，让我介绍一下常年活跃在阿尔泰山牧区的热河满都拉小组吧。过去，阿尔泰山牧区人民最大的困难，就是自己的畜产品卖不出去，需要的生产资料和生活资料买不进来。自从热河满都拉和他领导的流动贸易小组深入到那里以后，情况就完全改变了。热河满都拉小组一共有四个人。他们认真调查当地人民的需要，及时满足群众的要求。去年八月，阿拉哈克区的牧民缺少茶叶，热河满都拉知道以后，就克服种种困难把茶叶送到阿拉哈克区的蒙古包里。在摄氏零下三十多度的严寒里，热河满都拉和他领导的小组的同志们，虽然手冻得已经抓不住东西，但他们依旧坚持工作。有一次，他们从承化运货到阿苏木巴衣村，半路上碰到天要下雨，载在骆驼背上的茶叶、布匹、砂糖、纸张等都怕雨淋，热河满都拉和另一个组员就把骆驼赶进树林，忍着饥饿、寒冷和疲倦，过了一夜，使货物完整无损。这些事实，感动了当地的牧民群众。他们把热河满都拉小组称为共产党派来的为人民服务的小组。阿拉哈克区牧民自动替他们盖了两间有玻璃窗的房子，让他们能有一个比较好的营业所；克克逊区的牧民，也自动让出两间房子，让热河满都拉小组分两个人到那边常住。今年二月，热河满都拉小组要到塔城去运货，缺少骆驼，当地牧民就自动组织了八十七峰骆驼，帮助他们克服了困难。
    流动贸易小组的工作人员，不仅在牧区进行了购销业务，同时，还经常宣传党和人民政府的政策，从而提高了牧民的政治觉悟和生产积极性。柯坪牧区的贸易干部在收购羊毛的时候，向牧民宣传爱国保畜的道理，当地群众纷纷提出：“多打牧草，保证牛壮羊肥。”镇西牧区流动贸易小组的干部在收购时宣传并实行了“分等论价”的政策，大大提高了羊毛的纯度。
    几年以来，深入牧区的流动贸易小组，都贯彻执行了国家公平合理的价格政策，使牧区商品的交换比价，起了重大的变化。土产、特产的价格提高了，外来日用品的价格降低了。一九四九年，三百四十斤羊毛才能换到一匹雁塔布，去年只要五十四斤就可以换到一匹了；一九四九年，一百张羊皮，只能换八点三块茶砖，现在能换到六十块。目前各种土产、特产的价格，比一九四九年平均提高了八倍。
    产品交换比价的变化，给草原上的人们带来了幸福；牧民们经济生活提高了，生产发展了。蒲犁县三区一乡塔吉克族购买力的变化，就是一个具体的例子。一九四九年，这个乡每个牧民的平均购买力，只有四万一千零二十八元；到一九五二年，每个牧民的平均购买力，已增加到十三万一千四百一十三元。一九四九年，平均每人只能购买花洋布零点一档子（一档子等于二尺）；到一九五二年，平均每人已能购买花洋布二点五档子。在广大牧区中，过去没有蒙古包或只有个破烂的蒙古包的牧民，现在都制了新的蒙古包。过去很多穿不起新衣服的牧民，现在都纷纷添做新衣服。以前只能吃到酥油、青稞面的牧民，现在也能吃到白面了。常年住在蒙古包里的牧民，有的盖了房子，有的房子还用玻璃做了窗子。牧民家里，都挂着毛主席的肖像和各族人民喜爱的画片。各族人民都热爱毛主席和人民政府。他们感激地称颂毛主席是“红太阳”。和靖县有一个蒙古族牧民叫义仁且，今年六十多岁了。他因为害怕国民党拉伕修路，二十多年没出过山；去年第一次用一张马皮向流动贸易小组换了十包洋火、一包糖。他兴奋地称呼毛主席是“真正的活佛”。
