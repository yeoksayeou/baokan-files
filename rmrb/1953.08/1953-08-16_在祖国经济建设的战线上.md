Fushun Power Plant Successfully Experiments with Using Mixed Water Gangue to Replace Good Coal for Power Generation

The Fushun Power Plant is using water gangue to replace part of the good coal for power generation, which greatly reduces the cost of power generation. In June, when some of the plant's boilers were trial-fired, the fuel cost was 17% lower than in May. In July, after all the boilers used water gangue to replace part of the good coal, it is estimated that the fuel cost can be reduced by 28% compared to the past. Currently, the amount of water gangue mixed in is 50%. According to this figure, a large amount of good coal can be saved for the country.

Water gangue is a type of low-quality coal that is selected during the water washing of raw coal and is almost like a stone, which used to be discarded as waste. The plant's work on trial-burning water gangue began in mid-May this year. During the trial-burning process, a series of technical difficulties were encountered because the calorific value of water gangue is only about 2,000 calories per kilogram, and it has high ash content, making it difficult to ignite. However, the workers and technicians of the plant solved them one by one based on their past experience in burning low-quality coal. When the water gangue was difficult to ignite, they used the method of adjusting the wind pressure to help combustion; when the water gangue had low calorific value, they used the method of thickening the coal layer to increase the heat; when the water gangue had high ash content and the boiler produced a lot of ash, they created a set of quick ash removal methods and modified the operation methods to normalize the combustion in the furnace.

The Northeast Financial and Economic Committee and the Northeast Electric Power Administration are studying this experience and preparing to quickly promote it in various thermal power plants in Northeast China. (Xinhua News Agency)

Jingdezhen Produces the First Batch of National Day Porcelain

Jingdezhen City, a porcelain production area with a long history and world-renowned reputation, has produced the first batch of National Day porcelain.

The types of National Day porcelain include: Western tableware, coffee sets, tea sets, gift sets (vases, hanging plates), etc. The patterns on the screen include various dances of ethnic minorities and peace doves flying in the sky, which express the happy life of all ethnic groups in the big family of New China and the Chinese people's love for peace. In addition, there is also the Qinghua Doucai, which expresses the strong national flavor of our country. It is painted with a variety of colors, giving full play to the advantages of various colors, beautiful, simple, generous, and unified in regularity. This kind of painting existed in the Ming Dynasty, but has been lost for a long time, and now it has been restored. The quality of National Day porcelain is also better than before, with uniform softness, hardness, thickness, and fineness, and the porcelain is white and beautiful; moreover, the specifications and colors of each factory and kiln are unified.

These beautiful porcelains will soon be sent to all parts of the country. (Cheng Zhengshang)

Significant Achievements in Geological Exploration in Northwest China

The various field exploration teams under the Northwest Geological Bureau set off in early April to work in the Qinling Mountains, the northern part of the Helan Mountains, the Hexi Corridor, the Tianshan Mountains and other areas. The climate in these areas is constantly changing, and cotton clothes are required in the morning and evening, while the midday is unbearably hot. In the Gobi Desert, there is a risk of getting lost when the wind blows. Water sources are scarce, and drinking water is mostly dependent on snow water, and sometimes water has to be drawn from dozens of miles away. The field exploration teams overcame these difficulties. They set up tents and built roads in the mountains and Gobi Desert. In their work, they also persisted in studying political theory, culture and technical business.

Employees of various field teams have adopted new methods. Geological surveyors studied the Soviet "geological point" method to ensure the quality and accuracy of geological maps.

Under the help and guidance of the Central Geological Department, the Northwest Geological Bureau and Soviet experts, the teams have completed more than 800 square kilometers of geological survey, 16 square kilometers of detailed geological survey, more than 8,600 cubic meters of trench exploration, and more than 500 meters of pit exploration. The pit exploration of the 621 team showed minerals in every well. The 625 team found a coal-bearing area in a certain area of ​​Northwest China that can be further explored; it also discovered clay with adsorption properties in this coal-bearing area, which made a great contribution to heavy industrial construction.

People in Northwest China Enthusiastically Report Mineral Deposits

The masses in various parts of Northwest China actively launched mineral reporting activities. According to the statistics of the Mass Mineral Reporting Section of the Engineering Department of the Northwest Geological Bureau: from June 10 to July 23, a total of 54 reports of 18 kinds of minerals were received from various places, including 14 iron ore deposits, 8 coal mines, 4 copper mines, 2 asbestos deposits, 3 silver and mica deposits each, and 1 deposit each of manganese, nickel, gold, gemstones, clay, asphalt, nitrate, orpiment, gypsum, sulfur, white clay, and alum, and 8 other mineral deposits.

Wang Changshun, a farmer in Foping County, Shaanxi Province, dug up an important mineral when planting corn on the mountain, so he brought dry food, carried the mineral on his back, braved the hot weather, crossed the Qinling Mountains, crossed the Wei River, and took a train to Xi'an to send the mineral to the Northwest Geological Bureau. Ma Yongchang, a cadre of the Wen County People's Government in Gansu Province, used his spare time to climb mountains and ridges and cut through thorns with an axe to collect mineral samples in order to send mineral samples to supplement the report. His hands and feet were pierced with blood by wild jujube thorns, but he said excitedly: "For the needs of the country's economic construction, I gloriously completed the sampling task." Ni Wenguang of the People's Armed Forces Department of Shanyang County, Shaanxi Province, reported mineral deposits five or six times in a row, and also purchased reference books for identifying and identifying minerals, intending to lead the masses to report mineral deposits for the country in his spare time. Zhang Guangshi, who has long-term research experience on minerals, sent a manganese ore sample that he had preserved for six or seven years to the Northwest Geological Bureau, and said: "I must write the situation into detailed materials for your geological survey reference."

According to the important mineral materials reported by the masses, the Northwest Geological Bureau has dispatched two groups of outcrop teams to the designated areas for exploration and surveying.

The Yellow River Main Stream Survey Team Completes the Survey Work of the Ningxia Section

The survey team sent by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to the Ningxia-Tuoketuo section of the Yellow River main stream (from Qinglongxia in Ningxia Province to Tuoketuo in Suiyuan Province) has now completed the survey work of the Yellow River main stream in Ningxia Province. In the past two months, the Yellow River Main Stream Survey Team surveyed 400 kilometers of the Yellow River channel east of the Helan Mountains, Lingwu and Yanchi counties, and west of the Yikezhao League of Suiyuan Province, and collected meteorological, hydrological, shipping, irrigation, agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry and other data related to the Yellow River harnessing within an area of ​​about 8,000 square kilometers on both sides of the Yellow River channel.

During the work of the Yellow River Main Stream Survey Team in Ningxia Province, it received active support and assistance from the Party and government organs and people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia Province. Xing Zhaotang, Chairman of the Ningxia Provincial People's Government, specially transferred cadres to assist the survey team, and specially held a symposium to provide the survey team with information about the Yellow River. Farmers of all ethnic groups on both sides of the Yellow River also vigorously assisted the survey team. Many farmers gave the clean beds in their houses to the survey team to live in. When the survey team was surveying at the foot of the Helan Mountains, because of the difficulty in drinking water, the folks actively went to fetch water for the survey team to drink from dozens of miles away. Now, the survey team has entered the Ordos Plateau in Suiyuan Province to continue the survey work. (Xinhua News Agency)

    抚顺发电厂搀和水矸子代替好煤发电试验成功
    抚顺发电厂用水矸子代替部分好煤发电，使发电成本大大降低。六月份，该厂部分锅炉试烧时，燃煤成本就比五月份降低了百分之十七，七月份全部锅炉用水矸子代替部分好煤后，预计燃煤成本可比过去降低百分之二十八。目前水矸子的搀和量为百分之五十。根据这个数目计算，可以为国家节省大量好煤。
    水矸子是原煤经过水洗时被选出来的近乎石块的劣质煤，过去一向作为废物抛去的。该厂试烧水矸子的工作是在今年五月中旬开始的。在试烧过程中，由于水矸子每公斤发热量只有二千卡左右，同时灰份大，不易着火，所以曾碰到一系列的技术困难。但是，该厂工人和技术人员根据过去燃烧劣质煤的经验，都一一加以解决。水矸子不易着火，他们就用调整风压的办法帮助燃烧；水矸子发热量少，他们就用加厚送煤的煤层的办法，提高热量；水矸子灰份大，锅炉出灰多，他们就创造出一套快速扒灰法，并修正了操作方法，使炉内燃烧情况正常。
    东北财政经济委员会，东北电业管理局正在研究这一经验，准备迅速在东北各火力发电厂推广。（新华社）

    这些优美的瓷器，不久即可送到全国各地。 （程正裳）
    西北地质勘探工作获得显著成绩
    西北地质局所属各野外勘探队于四月上旬分别出发到秦岭、贺兰山北部、河西走廊、天山等地区进行工作，这些地区气候变化无常，早晚要穿棉衣，中午炎热难当。在戈壁滩上，大风吹起，就有迷路的危险。水源稀少，饮水多靠雪水，有时得在数十里以外拉水。野外勘探队战胜了这些困难。在崇山峻岭和戈壁滩中，搭起了帐篷，修筑了道路。在工作中，他们还坚持了政治理论、文化与技术业务学习。
    各野外队职工采用了新的方法。地质测绘人员学习了苏联“地质点”工作法，保证了地质图的质量和精确程度。
    各队在中央地质部、西北地质局和苏联专家帮助指导下，已经完成了地质普查八百余平方公里，地质详查十六平方公里，槽探八千六百余立方公尺，坑探五百余公尺。六二一队的坑探，井井见矿。六二五队在西北某地找到了可供进一步勘探的煤藏区；在这个煤藏区还发现了带有吸附性的黏土，对重工业建设贡献很大。
    西北各地人民踊跃报矿
    西北各地群众积极展开报矿活动。据西北地质局工务处群众报矿科统计：从六月十日到七月二十三日，共接到各地群众报告十八种五十四件，其中有铁质矿十四处，煤矿八处，铜矿四处，石棉两处，银矿、云母各三处，锰矿、镍矿、金矿、宝石、黏土、沥青、硝、雄黄、石膏、硫磺、白土、矾各一处，其他矿产八处。
    陕西佛坪县农民汪长顺，在山上种包谷时挖出一种重要矿物，便带了干粮，背着矿物，冒着大热天，翻过秦岭，渡过渭河，坐火车到了西安，把矿物送到了西北地质局。甘肃文县人民政府干部马永昌为了补寄矿苗样品，利用业余时间，攀登崇山峻岭，用斧头砍开荆棘采集矿样，手脚都被野枣刺刺出鲜血，他还兴奋地说：“为了祖国经济建设的需要，我光荣地完成了采样任务。”陕西山阳县人民武装部倪文光接连报矿五、六次，还购买了识别鉴定矿产的参考书，打算在工作以外的时间，带动群众来为祖国报矿。对于矿产有长期研究经验的张广石，把保存了六、七年的锰矿矿样送到西北地质局，并说：“我一定要把情况写成详细材料，供你们进行地质普查参考。”
    西北地质局根据群众报来的重要矿产材料，已经派出露头队的两个小组，分赴指定地区进行勘测。
    黄河干流查勘队完成宁夏段的查勘工作
    黄河水利委员会派往黄河干流宁托段（从宁夏省青铜峡到绥远省托克托）的查勘队，现已完成宁夏省黄河干流的查勘工作。黄河干流查勘队两个月来共查勘了贺兰山以东，灵武、盐池县和绥远省伊克昭盟以西四百公里长的黄河河道，并搜集了包括黄河河道两旁面积约八千平方公里内的气象、水文、航运、灌溉、农林、畜牧等根治黄河有关的资料。
    黄河干流查勘队在宁夏省工作期间，受到了宁夏省党、政机关和各族人民积极支持和帮助。宁夏省人民政府主席邢肇棠专门抽调干部协助查勘队工作，并特别召开了座谈会，为查勘队提供有关黄河的资料。黄河两岸各族农民也大力协助查勘队工作，许多农民把屋内净炕让给查勘队住。查勘队在贺兰山脚测量的时候，因为饮水困难，老乡们便积极地到数十里以外去取水给查勘队饮用。现在，查勘队已进入绥远省鄂尔多斯高原继续进行查勘工作。 （新华社）
