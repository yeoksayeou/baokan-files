Anshan Iron and Steel Company Strives for Early Completion of Three Major Key Projects
All Departments and Production Units Intensify Support to Guarantee Supply
[By this newspaper] Anshan Iron and Steel Company's basic construction has entered a tense construction phase, and all departments and production units are intensifying their actions to support basic construction.

This year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's basic construction projects include four major items, excluding housing construction. Among them, the thin plate rolling mill project is scheduled to be completed next year according to the national plan. The large rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant, which began construction last year, and the No. 7 blast furnace system, which began construction this year, are all striving to be completed within this year.

Currently, the large rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant projects are nearing completion, and partial mechanical equipment of the seamless steel tube plant has begun trial operation. The No. 7 blast furnace system project is under intense construction, and some parts of the project are also nearing completion. However, looking at the overall project situation, there are still many problems that need to be solved urgently. The large rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant projects urgently need to solve the problem of some equipment and materials for power, water, ventilation, oil, gas, and steam supply. In addition to many equipment and materials that need to be solved for the No. 7 blast furnace system project, some designs are also urgently awaiting completion.

In response to the above situation, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all employees of the construction unit to strive for the early completion of the three major projects and ensure the comprehensive completion of the national plan. It also instructed the departments within Anshan Iron and Steel Company that process and order goods to ensure quality and complete the processing and ordering tasks on schedule to support the early completion of the three major projects.

After the call from the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China was issued, the Basic Construction Equipment Department, Materials Department, Design Company, Metal Structure Engineering Company, and Blast Furnace Construction Engineering Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Company all successively formulated specific guarantee plans, and some also held mobilization meetings. After inspecting the equipment supply situation, the Equipment Department sent cadres to various places to urge various processing and production factories to deliver goods on time. The Materials Department formulated a special guarantee plan to solve the urgently needed materials, and adopted necessary measures, such as implementing a special responsibility system for urgently needed materials, that is, each urgently needed material is the responsibility of a special person to ensure the supply of the three major projects. The Design Company held a meeting, pointing out that speeding up the completion of the remaining designs is the central task that overrides everything, and decided that all designs related to the three major projects should be the responsibility of the responsible section chief, reducing unnecessary procedures and speeding up processing. The Blast Furnace Construction Engineering Company conducted ideological education for all employees of the company, and commended the Wang Zhencai scaffolder team and the Bai Fengchi riveter team who tried every means to complete the task.

The Mechanical General Factory and Refractory Factory, which process and manufacture equipment for basic construction, also regard the completion of the processing orders for the three major projects as the most important task at present. On August 6, the Mechanical General Factory convened a special meeting to check the completion of the processing orders for the three major projects and actively solve the remaining problems. For example, the five-ton crane needed in the No. 7 blast furnace system project lacked materials such as ball bearings, electrical insulation wood, and steel plates, and the meeting determined that a special person would be responsible for solving them. At the same time, special personnel were also assigned to be responsible for materials, technology, and other issues required for the manufacturing of the three major projects. Each workshop arranged the order of operations according to the priority and urgency, and determined the delivery date. The Refractory Factory also convened a special meeting to check the brick symbols, strengthen the production plan, and ensure the supply of engineering needs.

According to Xinhua News Agency: Anshan Iron and Steel Company will continue to supply a large amount of steel, pig iron, coke and other products to all parts of the country in the second half of this year. At present, more than 900 units across the country have signed orders with Anshan Iron and Steel Company. According to the contract, the steel billets for rolled heavy steel rails produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company in the second half of this year will be supplied to Chongqing 101 Steel Plant to roll steel rails for the Tiancheng Railway and Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway under construction. The light rails supplied by Anshan Iron and Steel Company in the second half of the year for forestry exploitation, construction engineering, and mine transportation can lay thousands of kilometers. Tens of thousands of tons of cast iron pipes required by Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Wuhan and other cities and the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant will also be supplied by Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

In addition to supplying various steel products for basic construction in various places, Anshan Iron and Steel Company will also supply steel, pig iron, coke, refractory materials, etc. required by machine manufacturing plants and steel plants in various places in the second half of the year.

    鞍钢争取三大重点工程提前竣工
    各部门与生产单位加紧支援保证供应
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司基本建设进入紧张的施工阶段，各部门与生产单位为支援基本建设，正加紧行动起来。
    今年鞍钢基本建设工程，除去住宅工程一项外，共有四大项。其中薄板轧制厂工程，按照国家预定计划，将在明年竣工。去年开始施工的大型轧钢厂与无缝钢管厂，以及今年开始施工的第七号高炉系统等三大工程，都要争取在今年年内全部竣工。
    现在大型轧钢厂与无缝钢管厂工程，已接近竣工阶段，无缝钢管厂局部机械设备已开始试转。第七号高炉系统工程，正在紧张施工，其中也有部分工程接近竣工。但就整个工程情况来看，还有许多问题急需解决。大型轧钢厂与无缝钢管厂工程，急需解决通电、通水、通风、通油、通煤气与通蒸气工程的部分设备与材料。第七号高炉系统工程除许多设备与材料需要解决外，尚有部分设计也急待完成。
    针对以上情况，中共鞍山市委号召施工单位全体职工，争取三大工程提前竣工，保证全面完成国家计划，并责成鞍钢内部加工订货的部门，必须保证质量，按期完成加工订货任务，以支援三大工程早日竣工。
    中共鞍山市委的号召发出后，鞍钢基本建设设备处、材料处、设计公司、金属结构工程公司与高炉建筑工程公司等部门，都先后订出具体的保证计划，有的还召开了动员大会。设备处检查了设备供应的情况后，且已派干部到各地催促各加工生产工厂按时交货。材料处为解决急需的材料问题，专门作了保证计划，并采取了必要的措施，如实行急需材料专责制，即每种急需材料都由专人负责，保证三大工程的供应。设计公司召开会议，指出加紧完成尚未交出的部分设计是压倒一切的中心任务，并决定凡是有关三大工程的设计，都由主管科长负责，减少不必要的手续，加速处理。高炉建筑工程公司对全公司职工进行了思想教育，并表扬了为完成任务想尽一切办法的王真才架工小组与白凤池铆工小组。
    为基本建设加工制作设备的机械总厂与耐火厂等单位，也都把完成三大工程的加工订货当作当前最主要的任务。机械总厂在八月六日召集了专门会议，检查三大工程加工订货完成的情况，并积极解决还存在的问题。如第七号高炉系统工程中需要的五吨起重机，缺乏滚珠、隔电木与钢板等材料，会上便确定专人负责解决。同时对制作三大工程设备所需的材料、技术等问题，也都确定专人负责。各车间都按照轻重缓急，排定了作业顺序，确定了交货日期。耐火厂也召集了专门会议，按砖的符号进行检查，并加强了生产计划，保证供应工程需要。
    据新华社讯：鞍山钢铁公司今年下半年将继续以大量钢材、生铁和焦炭等产品供应全国各地。目前，全国已有九百多个单位和鞍钢签订了订货合同。按照合同规定，今年下半年鞍钢生产的轧制重钢轨用的钢坯，将全部供给重庆一零一钢铁厂，为正在建筑中的天成铁路、兰新铁路轧制钢轨。鞍钢下半年供应各地森林开采、建筑工程等工地和矿山运输用的轻轨，可铺设数千公里长。北京、天津、上海、青岛、武汉等城市及第一汽车制造厂需用的数万吨铸铁管，也将由鞍钢得到供应。
    鞍钢除大量供应各地基本建设用的各种钢材外，下半年还将供应各地机器制造厂、钢铁厂需用的钢材、生铁、焦炭和耐火材料等。
