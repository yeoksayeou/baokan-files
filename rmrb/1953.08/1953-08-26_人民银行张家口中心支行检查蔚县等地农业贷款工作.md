    People's Bank of China Zhangjiakou Central Branch Inspects Agricultural Loan Work in Yu County and Other Areas
    Letter from the People's Bank of China Zhangjiakou Central Branch: In the "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on May 19th, reader Xiao Chen criticized the shortcomings in our special district's Yu County and other People's Bank's issuance of fertilizer loans. We are now informing you of the results of the inspection. When the Yu County People's Bank arranged the issuance of fertilizer loans, it made an internally controlled regulation: "No new loans will be issued if old loans are not repaid; disaster-stricken households and households in difficulty are exceptions." This decision was inappropriate. Some business offices only paid attention to the first half of the sentence and ignored the second half, only looking at whether the old loans were repaid, and ignoring the actual needs of poor farmers in production, which seriously violated the loan policy and affected farmers' production. In addition, when issuing loans, the county's production office, cooperative, and People's Bank jointly decided that borrowers should go to the cooperative to collect fertilizer after completing loan procedures at the bank, which essentially restricted farmers' voluntary purchase of fertilizer. The County People's Bank also blindly implemented this without adhering to the loan policy. This practice was not corrected until problems arose in the work and instructions were issued by the Special Commissioner's Office, the Special District Financial and Economic Committee, and the Central Branch. The reason for the above problems is inseparable from the bureaucratic leadership style of the Central Branch. We only relied on subjective estimates to determine the loan indicators, did not have enough knowledge of the loan situation, and failed to discover and solve problems in the work of lower-level banks in a timely manner, so that agricultural loan work could not effectively support agricultural production. We sincerely accept the reader's opinion and are determined to actively correct the shortcomings and errors in our work.
Correction
    In the "Answers to Readers' Questions" in the August 9th column "Several Questions on Population Survey Registration", the last sentence of the answer to the question "What conditions must be met to be considered a household?" should be changed to "Family households residing in institutions, schools, and other units shall fill out Form A within their respective institutions and schools for unified registration."

### 人民银行张家口中心支行检查蔚县等地农业贷款工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    人民银行张家口中心支行检查蔚县等地农业贷款工作
    中国人民银行张家口中心支行来信：五月十九日“读者来信摘要”栏中，读者晓晨对我专区蔚县等人民银行发放肥料贷款工作中的缺点提出批评，兹将检查结果告诉你们。蔚县人民银行布置发放肥料贷款工作时作出了一个内部掌握的规定：“旧贷不交，新贷不贷；受灾户、困难户例外。”这一决定是不妥当的。有的营业所执行时只注意了前半句而忽略了后半句，只看旧贷是否归还，而不顾贫困农民生产上的实际需要，严重地违犯了贷款政策，影响了农民生产。此外，在发放贷款时，该县生产办公室、合作社和人民银行共同决定了受贷户到银行办贷款手续后就到合作社取肥料的做法，实质上限制了农民自愿选购肥料。县人民银行也不坚持贷款政策而盲目执行了。直到工作中发生问题，专署、专区财政经济委员会、中心支行发出指示后，这种做法才被纠正过来。以上问题发生的原因是与中心支行的官僚主义领导作风分不开的。我们对放款指标的确定只凭主观估计，对放款情况掌握不够，对下级行工作中的问题不能及时发现和解决，以致使农贷工作不能有效地支持农业生产。我们诚恳接受读者意见，并决心积极纠正工作中的缺点和错误。更正
    八月九日本栏“关于人口调查登记的几个问题”的“答读者问”中，对“具备什么条件才可以作为一户？”这个问题的答复，最后一句应改为“在机关、学校等单位内居住的家庭户，就在各机关、学校内填甲式表统一办理登记。”
