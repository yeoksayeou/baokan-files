    A Critique of Lao She's Play "Spring Flowers, Autumn Fruits"
    Guang Weiran
    Lao She's three-act play "Spring Flowers, Autumn Fruits" (published by People's Literature Publishing House in August 1953, performed by the Beijing People's Art Theater in Beijing from April 1st to May 22nd), uses the significant "Five-Antis" movement as its theme. It depicts the workers of a private iron factory in the capital, under the leadership of the Party and the government, launching a resolute counterattack against the rampant attacks of illegal capitalists, and achieving victory. This new work by Mr. Lao She, following "Fang Pearl" and "Dragon Beard Ditch," further demonstrates his close attention to the current struggles between the old and the new, and social reform movements. Mr. Lao She strives to break through his own life limitations, selects themes of great political significance from the realities of struggle, and through artistic creation, promptly reflects the major events of how the working class wages sharp struggles against the reactionary thoughts of the bourgeoisie to safeguard the interests of the country and the people. This political enthusiasm and creative enthusiasm are very valuable. Mr. Lao She, in close cooperation with the Beijing People's Art Theater, has repeatedly revised this script more than ten times. In the current situation where playwriting is not very vigorous, Mr. Lao She's diligence, humility, and persistent perseverance are particularly worthy of learning for all playwrights.
    From the play "Spring Flowers, Autumn Fruits," we can see that the author strives to analyze the materials he possesses from the standpoint and viewpoint of the working class, combined with his usual social observations, and permeates the description of the object with distinct political feelings. The play depicts the contradiction between the working class and the capitalists in their different attitudes towards the country and production; depicts the working class's selfless labor and master-like attitude in order to produce more and better products; depicts the rampant behavior of illegal capitalists in organizing small groups, bribing state staff, and cutting corners in order to pursue illegal profits; it also depicts the policy of the People's Government and the working class towards capitalists, which is both struggle and unity, and the policy of restriction, education and transformation. The bourgeoisie problem is one of the basic problems in China's gradual transition to a socialist society. The author of "Spring Flowers, Autumn Fruits" has undertaken such an important task in the play, which is to draw a clear political line between the working class and the bourgeoisie, expose the ugly face of the bourgeoisie who resist national leadership and refuse workers' supervision, shatter the bourgeoisie's sophistry of their illegal behavior, awaken the vigilance and righteous indignation of the working class and the masses, and also point out the legitimate way out for bourgeois entrepreneurs in our country. In this purpose, this work is still the first attempt in the literary circles of our country today, and from the main aspect, it is a successful attempt. In exposing the illegal behavior of capitalists and raising the vigilance of the people and the awareness of workers, this work is of educational significance.
    The image of the capitalists written by Mr. Lao She in this play is vivid and can give people a deep impression. Their activities and their environment have a strong local color. The author uses concise and characterful language to deeply portray the hypocrisy, decay, and rampant illegal thoughts and behaviors of these characters. The unfolding of the drama, centered on the activities of the main character Ding Yiping, is very dramatic in the first half of the play, with sharp conflicts, tight plots, and rapid (often unexpected) changes. The clever interweaving of different aspects of Ding Yiping's activities (towards government economic agencies and their staff, towards other capitalists, towards the factory's staff, towards the factory's workers, towards his own family, and finally towards the inspection team of the "Five-Antis" movement), and the entire drama's layer-by-layer progression towards the inevitable climax of the conflict, shows the author's talent. The few characters the author arranged around Ding Yiping are all necessary for the development of the drama and are representative. The author's depiction of some minor characters in the illegal capitalist group does indeed achieve what the author himself said, "to make them stand up with a few words." Look at the sickly Qian shopkeeper, who is "always afraid that one breath won't come and he will die," but still "wants to grab a few more before he kicks the bucket." In these places, it can be seen that the writer's scalpel has pierced deep into the souls of these decadent characters. Also, Tang Ziming, the timid and fearful factory owner of the iron factory, Guan Qingbo, the rascally and daring manager of the hardware store, Wang Xianzhu, the grinning broker, and Li Dingguo, the cautious bookkeeper (who was later won back to the ranks of the working class), their faces and character traits are also appropriately portrayed. Although Ding Yiping's description is not unified and complete enough, his thoughts and character are generally expressed. When people see these corrupt and profit-seeking figures, colluding with each other and combining to carry out illegal theft, and when they see them still carrying out all kinds of stubborn resistance under the angry counterattack of the working class, they cannot help but gain an understanding: the struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie is inevitable and has a profound foundation; it is necessary to repel the attacks of the bourgeoisie, and it is necessary to restrict, educate, and transform bourgeois entrepreneurs so that they can no longer be solely profit-seeking, but carry out their legitimate activities under the leadership of the working class in accordance with the needs of the state and the people.
    The shortcoming of Mr. Lao She in depicting capitalists is that the expression of Ding Yiping's transformation relies too much on reasoning (which makes the development of the second half of the play dull), especially for the transformed Ding Yiping, he has not been able to make an appropriate performance, so that the entire work is not complete enough politically and artistically. In addition, although the words, smiles, and demeanors of the characters in Mr. Lao She's capitalist group accurately reflect the customs of the ancient capital's industrial and commercial society, and reflect the dispersity, conservatism, and backwardness of the old-fashioned industrial and commercial capitalists in Beijing; but these characteristics are not very suitable for expressing the capitalists who the author seems to want to depict who want to monopolize steel production. Although the main character Ding Yiping expressed the ambition to monopolize, and said in the "epilogue" of the play that his factory has the ability to undertake the manufacture of 30,000 to 50,000 seven-step plows; but from the entire play, his demeanor, his tricks, his social relations, his relationship with the workers, etc., it seems that he is still the boss of a small-scale, semi-handicraft iron factory.
    As the author himself pointed out, the main weakness of the script is the expression of the workers. The portrayal of the images of the workers, the description of their thoughts and character, in contrast to the image of the capitalists, are obviously flat, weak, and lacking in flesh and blood. The character of the chairman of the trade union should have been the center of gravity of the play, should have been a lively, overall, and advanced typical, but now lacks color and attractiveness, and does not show his weight. The reaction of the "waterwheel incident" arranged in the play among the workers is not powerful enough. Because most of the workers' families live in the rural areas near the suburbs, and most of them have contact with the peasants, the serious cutting of corners by Manager Ding in the waterwheel ordering before the "Five-Antis" would cause great losses to the peasants, and the workers at that time would not have been difficult to appreciate. However, even after the worker Jiang Er was injured, everyone only started from the noble desire to love labor and make "beautiful work", and behind their backs, they issued a burst of complaints to the manager. These places weakened the ideological and artistic power of the script.
    In the "Spring Flowers, Autumn Fruits" script, Mr. Lao She handled such a major theme as the "Five-Antis" movement, and relatively steadily grasped the state's policies, which shows that the author's spirit of studying and delving into national policies is commendable. However, the policy nature of literary and artistic works means that writers rely on the guidance of policies to understand the ins and outs of life, while still requiring writers to start from the specific circumstances of life, strictly follow the principles of realism, delve into the interior of life and the depths of people's souls, and engage in realistic and specific descriptions, thereby objectively revealing the spirit and power of policies from the specific development of events.
    "Spring Flowers, Autumn Fruits" has not completely met this requirement. The script about the workers' scenes has very few plots, and mainly consists of discussion, debate, speeches, and feelings. In the third act of the play, the characters' actions became a diagram of the writer's explanation of policies and struggle strategies. In the "epilogue," the writer raised and solved a series of ideological problems: such as Master Ma's passive thoughts: "We are too enthusiastic about reforming machines, etc., isn't it a bit like hooking up with the manager?" Liu "Cannon"'s impatience: "After being positive, isn't the manager still making money?" Jiang Er's easy satisfaction: "I think it's good that he has already agreed to 10,000 units, it's better than nothing!" Finally, there were Liu "Cannon" and Lu "Second Cannon"'s confused thoughts: "Why not change to socialism all at once?" Here, the writer sequentially solved a series of confused ideological problems, perhaps in order to clarify the spirit of the policy, but the actual effect inevitably simplified the workers' thoughts and the process of solving ideological contradictions, and made the characters tools for the writer to explain policies and various ideological concerns. The characters' actions and language showed traces of the writer's deliberate arrangement, which inevitably damaged the authenticity.
    Creative problems must be gradually and completely solved by writers in continuous life practice and creative practice. With Mr. Lao She's labor attitude and open-minded spirit, he will definitely be able to gradually cross the obstacles in front of him and create more and better works in the future. We fully agree with Mr. Lao She's brilliant statement: "Excellent works are not produced solely by wishes, but are the fruits of the most and greatest labor."
    (See Mr. Lao She's article "How I Wrote the 'Spring Flowers, Autumn Fruits' Script," published in the "Script" monthly magazine, May 1953)
    The performance of this play by the Beijing People's Art Theater is very successful. In particular, the characters playing the capitalist group are generally played vividly and realistically, and some of them can even give people a lasting impression. Here, it can be seen that the actors have made diligent efforts in experiencing life and studying life, and it can also be seen that the director has devoted a lot of effort to the performance work. Without these, the current achievements cannot be obtained.

    评老舍作话剧“春华秋实”
    光未然
    老舍先生的三幕话剧“春华秋实”（人民文学出版社一九五三年八月出版，北京人民艺术剧院曾于四月一日至五月二十二日在北京演出），以意义重大的“五反”运动为题材，描写首都某一私营铁工厂的工人，在党和政府的领导之下，对不法资本家的猖狂进攻展开了坚决的反击，并得到了胜利。老舍先生继“方珍珠”“龙须沟”之后的这一新的创作，进一步表现了他对当前的新旧斗争与社会改革运动的密切关注。老舍先生力求突破自己的生活限制，选取现实斗争生活中具有重大政治意义的题材，通过艺术创作，把工人阶级如何为保卫国家和人民的利益，向资产阶级反动思想展开尖锐斗争的重大事件及时反映出来，这种政治热情、创作热情是非常可贵的。老舍先生在和北京人民艺术剧院的密切合作下，对这个剧本进行了十次以上的反复修改。在目前剧本创作不够旺盛的情况下，老舍先生的勤劳、虚心和坚持不懈的毅力，是特别值得所有剧作家们学习的。
    从话剧“春华秋实”中，我们可以看出作者力求以工人阶级的立场观点来分析自己所占有的材料，结合着自己平时的社会观察，把鲜明的政治感情渗透到对象的描写中去。剧本描写了工人阶级和资本家对待国家、对待生产上的两种不同态度的矛盾；描写了工人阶级为了生产更多更好的产品而忘我劳动的主人翁态度；描写了不法资本家为了追求非法利润而组织小集团、贿赂国家工作人员、偷工减料的猖狂行为；也描写了人民政府和工人阶级对资本家又斗争、又团结的限制政策和教育改造政策。资产阶级问题是我国在逐步过渡到社会主义社会的过程中的基本问题之一。“春华秋实”的作者在戏剧中负起了这样重要的任务，即划清工人阶级与资产阶级的政治界限，把反抗国家领导、拒绝工人监督的资产阶级的丑恶面目暴露出来，粉碎资产阶级对自己的不法行为的诡辩，唤起工人阶级和人民群众的警觉和义愤，同时也指出资产阶级企业家在我国的正当出路。在这个目的上，这个作品还是今天我国文学界的第一次尝试，并且从主要方面说来，是一次成功的尝试。在揭露资本家的不法行为，提高人民的警惕性和工人的觉悟性方面，这个作品是有教育意义的。
    老舍先生在这个剧本中所写的资本家的形象是生动的，能够给人以深刻的印象。他们的活动和他们的环境有浓厚的地方色彩。作者运用简洁的、性格化的语言，深入地刻划了这些人物的虚伪性、腐朽性和猖狂不法的思想行为。以主要角色丁翼平的活动为中心的戏剧的展开，在剧本的前半部，是很富于戏剧性的，有尖锐的冲突，紧凑的情节和迅速的（往往是意外的）变化。丁翼平的活动的不同方面（对待政府经济机关及其工作人员，对待其他资本家，对待本厂职员，对待本厂工人，对待自己的家庭，最后是对待“五反”运动的检查组）的机巧的穿插，整个戏剧一层一层地向冲突高潮的不可避免的前进，表现了作者的才能。作者安排在丁翼平周围的不多的人物，都是戏剧发展所必要的，并且是有代表性的。作者对不法资本家集团中某些次要人物的描写，确乎做到了如作者自己所说的“用三言五语使他们站立起来”。试看那位病病歪歪的钱掌柜，他“老怕一口气不来，就呜呼哀哉”，可还是“想乘着还没断气，多抓弄几个”。在这些地方，可以看出作家的解剖刀，已经刺进这类腐朽人物的灵魂深处了。又如胆小怕事的铁工厂厂主唐子明，泼皮大胆的五金行经理管清波，嬉皮笑脸的跑合商人王先舟，小心翼翼的账房先生李定国（他后来被争取回到工人阶级队伍了），他们的面貌和性格特征，也都得到恰如其份的描写。丁翼平的描写虽然还不够统一、不够完整，但他的思想和性格，一般说来也表现出来了。人们看到这些腐朽的惟利是图的人物，互相倾轧又互相结合起来进行非法盗窃的时候，看到他们在工人阶级的愤怒还击下还要进行千方百计的顽抗的时候，就不能不得到一种觉悟：工人阶级和资产阶级之间的斗争是必然的，是有深刻基础的；必须击退资产阶级的进攻，必须限制教育改造资产阶级企业家使他们不能再唯利是图，而在工人阶级领导下按照国家和人民的需要进行他们的合法的活动。
    老舍先生在描写资本家方面的缺点是表现丁翼平的转变过多地依靠说理（这使戏剧后半部的发展陷于沉闷），特别是对于转变以后的丁翼平没有能作出适当的表现，以致整个作品在政治上和艺术上都不够完整。此外，老舍先生笔下的资本家集团的人物的言谈笑貌，虽然精确地反映出了古都工商业社会的习俗，反映出了北京老派的工商业资本家的分散性、保守性和落后性；但这些特征，用以表现作者所企图描写的似乎想独占钢铁生产的资本家，却不很相称。剧中主要角色丁翼平虽然表示了独占的雄心，并在戏剧的“尾声”中说他的工厂有承造三五万件七步犁的能力；但从整个剧本所表现出来的，他的气概，他的花样，他的社会关系，他和工人的关系等等看来，他究竟还是一个生产规模狭小的半手工业式的铁工厂的老板。
    像作者自己所指出的，剧本的主要弱点是对于工人的表现。剧中对工人的形象的塑造、对他们的思想和性格的描写，在和资本家的形象对比之下，显然是平板，薄弱而缺少血肉。工会主席这个人物本应该是剧中的重心，应该是一个生气勃勃的、总领全局的、先进者的典型，现在却缺乏色彩和吸引力，显不出他的分量。剧本安排的“水车事件”在工人中的反应也不够有力。因为工人的家大都住在近郊的农村，他们大部分和农民是有联系的，所以，“五反”前丁经理在水车订货上严重的偷工减料，这会带给农民多大的损失，工人们当时是不难体会到的。可是甚至在工人姜二受伤之后，大家也只是从爱劳动、爱作“漂亮活”的高尚愿望出发，背后对经理发出了一阵抱怨。这些地方，削弱了剧本的思想和艺术的力量。
    老舍先生在“春华秋实”剧本中，处理了像“五反”运动这样重大的题材，并比较稳当地掌握了国家的政策，由此可见作者对国家政策的学习与钻研精神，是值得称赞的。但文学艺术作品的政策性，是意味着作家依靠政策的指引，洞察生活的来龙去脉，同时仍然要求作家从生活的具体情况出发，严格地遵循现实主义原则，深入到生活内部和人们的灵魂深处，从事真实的、具体的描写，从而由事件的具体发展中，客观地显露出政策的精神和力量。
    “春华秋实”还没有完满地达到这一要求。剧本关于工人的场面，情节很少，主要的是议论，辩论，演说，感想。在剧本的第三幕，人物的行动成了作家说明政策与斗争策略的图解。在“尾声”中，作家提出和解决了一系列的思想问题：如马师傅的消极思想：“咱们太热心改造机器什么的，是不是有点像勾着经理似的呢？”刘“大炮”的急躁思想：“积极完了，还不是叫经理赚钱？”姜二的容易满足：“我看他已经应下来一万部，就不错，总比没有强啊！”最后又是刘“大炮”、吕“二炮”的糊涂思想：“为什么不一下子改成社会主义呢？”作家在这里针对着一连串的糊涂思想问题依次加以解决，或许是为了借此阐明政策的精神，可是，实际的效果却不免把工人的思想及思想矛盾的解决过程简单化了，并且使人物成了作家交代政策、交代各种思想顾虑的工具。人物的行动和语言显出了作家有意安排的痕迹，不可免地使真实性受到了损害。
    创作上的问题，必须依靠作家在不断的生活实践和创作实践中，逐步达到完满地解决。以老舍先生的劳动态度和虚怀若谷的精神，今后一定能逐步跨过横亘在前面的障碍，创作出更多更好的作品。我们完全同意老舍先生的精彩说法：“优秀的作品不专凭愿望就能产生，而是最多最大的劳动的果实。”
    （见老舍先生写的“我怎样写的‘春华秋实’剧本”一文，载“剧本”月刊一九五三年五月号）
    北京人民艺术剧院对此剧的演出是很有成绩的。特别是饰演资本家集团的人物，一般都演得生动真实，其中有些人物甚至能够给人以经久难忘的印象。这里可以看出，演员在体验生活、研究生活方面所作的辛勤的努力，也可以看出导演在演出工作上所付的心血。没有这些是不能获得目前的成绩的。
