(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th) According to "Labor News," the Eleventh Plenary Session of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions was held from the 3rd to the 4th of August in the Column Hall of the Trade Union Building in Moscow.

The meeting heard a report by N.M. Shvernik, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, on the implementation of collective contracts in 1953 in Soviet industrial, transportation, construction, and agricultural enterprises regarding the improvement of housing and living conditions for workers and staff. In his report, Shvernik pointed out that the construction of housing, schools, children's welfare institutions, cultural institutions, shops, canteens, hospitals, and other public utilities in the Soviet Union is expanding year by year. In the period after the end of the Patriotic War, the total area of buildings restored and constructed in Soviet cities and workers' settlements reached more than 155.5 million square meters, and more than 3.8 million square meters of buildings were constructed in rural areas. Currently, the Soviet Union is still carrying out large-scale construction of housing and various cultural and welfare facilities. In total, during the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, the total area of buildings constructed by the state in cities and workers' settlements will reach approximately 100.5 million square meters. By 1955, the total state investment in public utilities will increase by about 50 percent compared to 1950. At present, the construction of domestic housing, cultural, and welfare facilities is proceeding on a large scale. The main projects in the first half of 1953 increased by 7 percent compared to the same period in 1952 for housing, 17 percent for schools, 16 percent for hospitals and clinics, and 30 percent for kindergartens and nurseries. The Soviet government also pays special attention to helping workers and staff build private houses. In the post-war period, the living area built by workers and staff with government loans is approximately 21 million square meters. Shvernik then talked about the development of commerce and public catering, as well as the shortcomings and problems existing in the implementation of collective contracts in industrial, transportation, construction, and agricultural enterprises.

The meeting discussed Shvernik's report and adopted a resolution to strengthen supervision and leadership over the implementation of collective contracts. The resolution pointed out that collective contracts concluded by factory trade union committees and local trade union committees of industrial, construction, transportation, commercial, and agricultural enterprises with the administration are of great significance for the victorious completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan and for the continuous improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of workers and staff. However, not all enterprises strictly implement the collective contracts. Trade union organizations still have shortcomings in leading workers in the implementation of collective contracts. Trade union organizations do not adequately inspect the implementation of these issues and do not regularly carry out the necessary work to support such resolutions. In addition, the central committees of the various trade unions have not striven for leadership from the various ministries to strengthen the implementation of collective contracts. Therefore, the resolution further pointed out that the most important task of trade unions and economic organizations is to mobilize workers, engineers, technicians, and staff to strive to complete the tasks stipulated by the 19th Party Congress, to further promote socialist production, and to fulfill and over fulfill the state plan. Local trade union organizations should work with economic leaders to take measures to unconditionally complete the construction plans for housing, children's welfare institutions, canteens, shops, sanatoriums, rest homes, schools, and other cultural and welfare facilities as stipulated in the collective contracts. It is necessary to ensure the quality of construction, reduce construction costs, and resolutely fight against the bad tendencies of rough engineering and perfunctory completion.

    全苏工会中央理事会第十一次全会决议
    加强对各企业执行集体合同的监督和领导
    【新华社十九日讯】莫斯科消息：据“劳动报”报道：全苏工会中央理事会三日至四日在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅举行了第十一次全体会议。
    会议听取了全苏工会中央理事会主席尼·米·什维尔尼克的报告。他谈到了一九五三年苏联工业、运输、建筑和农业企业执行改善职工住宅和生活条件的集体合同的情况。什维尔尼克在报告中指出：苏联住宅、学校、儿童福利机关、文化机关、商店、食堂、医院和其他公用事业的建筑工程，一年比一年扩大。在卫国战争结束后的时期内，苏联城市和工人住宅区恢复和修建的建筑物总面积，共达一亿五千五百多万平方公尺，乡村中修建了总面积为三百八十多万平方公尺的建筑物。现在，苏联还在大规模地进行住宅和各种文化与生活福利事业的建设工作。总计在第五个五年计划期间，由国家出资在城市和工人住宅区建筑的建筑物总面积，将达一亿零五百万平方公尺左右。到一九五五年，国家对公用事业的投资总额，将比一九五零年约增加百分之五十。现在，国内住宅和文化、生活福利事业的建筑工作正在大规模地进行着，一九五三年上半年的主要工程，在住宅方面比一九五二年同期增多了百分之七，学校多百分之十七，医院和诊疗所多百分之十六，幼儿园和托儿所多百分之三十。苏联政府同时特别注意帮助工人和职员建筑私人住宅。战后时期，工人和职员靠政府贷款建筑的居住面积，约为二千一百万平方公尺。什维尔尼克接着谈到了商业和公共饮食业发展的情况，以及工业、运输、建筑和农业企业在执行集体合同方面所存在的缺点和问题。
    会议讨论了什维尔尼克的报告，并通过了加强对执行集体合同的监督和领导的决议。决议指出：工业、建筑、运输、商业和农业企业的工厂工会委员会与地方工会委员会，跟行政上订立的集体合同，对胜利完成第五个五年计划，对不断提高职工物质福利和文化水平，有着重大的意义。但是，并不是所有的企业都严格执行了集体合同。工会组织在领导工人执行集体合同中，还存在着缺点。工会组织对有关这些问题的执行情况检查不够，没有经常进行必要的工作来支持这种决议。此外，各工会中央委员会也没有争取各部对加强执行集体合同的领导。因此，决议进一步指出：工会和经济组织最重要的任务是，动员工人、工程师、技术员、职员为完成第十九次党代表大会所规定的任务，为使社会主义生产进一步高涨，为完成和超额完成国家计划而努力。各地工会组织应当和经济领导人员共同采取措施，无条件地完成集体合同所规定的住宅、儿童福利机关、食堂、商店、疗养院、休养所、学校和其他文化与生活福利事业的建设计划。必须保证建筑的质量，减低建筑成本，坚决和工程粗糙、草率完工的不良倾向作斗争。
