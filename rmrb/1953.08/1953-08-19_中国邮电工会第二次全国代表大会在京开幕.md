    The Second National Congress of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union opened in the capital on August 17th. This congress will, according to the spirit of the Seventh National Congress of the Trade Union, summarize the work of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union since its First National Congress, determine the guidelines and tasks of the postal and telecommunications workers during the national construction period, and elect the Second National Committee and the Funds Review Committee of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union.

    The congress opened with a speech by Xiang Minghua, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union. Wang Zigang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government, delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress. Then, Li Jinghan, Acting Chairman of the First National Committee of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, gave a report on the work of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union.

    In his report, Li Jinghan described the basic achievements of the Chinese postal and telecommunications workers over the past three years and more, saying: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese postal and telecommunications workers have implemented the resolutions of the First National Congress of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, worked hard to overcome various difficulties, completed the national communication tasks, and restored and developed the people's postal and telecommunications services. A national communication network centered on Beijing has been initially established, and relatively close communication links have been established with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. In rural areas, drought-resistant postal routes have increased three times compared with before liberation, and the number of post and telecommunications offices has increased 2.3 times compared with before liberation. Postal and telecommunications workers have made brilliant achievements in supporting the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, liberating Tibet, cooperating with land reform, and in communication work for flood control and flood prevention. Over the past three years, the number of members of the National Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union has continued to increase. By the end of 1952, the number of members had increased by 75.66 percent compared with the time of the First National Congress in 1950, and had grown to account for 91.7 percent of the total number of postal and telecommunications workers. The postal and telecommunications union organizations have been consolidated and are relatively pure. Over the past three years and more, a large number of cadres have been sent to the Party, the Youth League, the government, the higher-level trade unions, and enterprises, and thousands of model figures have been cultivated.

    Over the past three years and more, the postal and telecommunications union has also made many achievements in implementing the policy of "orientation towards production". The main achievements are to coordinate with administrative summaries and to promote Guo Xiuyun's operation method, the experience of Beijing-Tianjin mail delivery work, the work method of the Shenyang Telecommunications Bureau's automatic telephone mechanical section, etc., which are decisive for production, and to mobilize employees to launch labor competitions, and to gain some major experiences in the union's work of "orientation towards production". With the increasing recovery and development of postal and telecommunications enterprises, the material and cultural life of postal and telecommunications workers has also been continuously improved. In 1952, the wages of postal and telecommunications workers across the country increased by 22.88 percent compared with 1949. In 1952, postal and telecommunications enterprises across the country built 100,000 square meters of new dormitories, and in 1953, another 150,000 square meters of new dormitories are under construction. Various collective welfare and cultural and educational undertakings such as medical institutions, sanatoriums, convalescent homes, rest homes, milk stations, nutrition canteens, nurseries, breastfeeding rooms, spare-time schools, cultural classes, and libraries for postal and telecommunications workers are constantly growing and improving every year.

    In his report, Li Jinghan examined and criticized the shortcomings and errors in the past work of the postal and telecommunications union, and finally put forward the most important and most basic tasks of the postal and telecommunications union organization during the national construction period: it must correctly implement the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of the Trade Union, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, connect and educate the masses of postal and telecommunications workers, actively complete postal and telecommunications production plans and construction plans, ensure state communication secrets, carry out labor competitions, improve the quality of postal and telecommunications work, exploit the potential of existing equipment, improve labor productivity and reduce enterprise costs, in order to cooperate with the country's defense, political power, economic, and cultural construction and gradually meet the people's communication needs, and on the basis of developing production, gradually improve the material and cultural life of postal and telecommunications workers, and work with the national working class to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, unite the people of all strata, and strive to realize the country's industrialization and gradually transition to a socialist society.

    In order to better complete the tasks undertaken by the postal and telecommunications union during the national construction period, Li Jinghan pointed out that the postal and telecommunications union must, under the leadership of the Party, combine production and the daily life of the masses, conduct practical communist education for employees, improve the employees' level of awareness, strengthen organization, establish an overall concept and a spirit of collectivism, and carry out cultural, technical, and business education, as well as sports and entertainment activities. The postal and telecommunications union must continue to strengthen its own construction work, rely closely on the Party, and obtain the guidance and assistance of local trade unions. In addition to continuing to strengthen the work at the grassroots level in large and medium-sized cities, it must also strengthen the work at the grassroots level in counties and towns, in order to unite all employees around the Party and enable the postal and telecommunications union to play a greater role during the national construction period.

    中国邮电工会第二次全国代表大会在京开幕

    李景韩在报告中叙述三年多来中国邮电工人的基本成就时说：中国邮电工人在中国共产党的领导下，贯彻了中国邮电工会第一次全国代表大会的决议，努力克服了各种困难，完成了国家通信任务，恢复并发展了人民邮电事业。初步建立了以北京为中心的全国通信网，和苏联以及各人民民主国家建立了比较密切的通信联系。在农村中，旱班邮路比解放前增加了三倍，邮电局、所比解放前增加了二点三倍。邮电工人在支持抗美援朝、解放西藏、配合土地改革以及治淮、防汛等通信工作中，都有光辉的成绩。三年来全国邮电工会会员人数不断增加。到一九五二年底，会员人数比一九五零年召开第一次全国代表大会时，增加了百分之七十五点六六，并发展到占邮电职工总数的百分之九十一点七。邮电工会组织经过整顿，比较纯洁了。三年多来，向党、团、政府、上级工会和企业输送了大批干部，并培养了数以千计的模范人物。
    三年多来，邮电工会在贯彻“面向生产”的方针上也有许多成绩。主要的是配合行政总结和推广了对生产有决定意义的郭秀云操作法、京津邮件投递工作经验、沈阳电信局市内自动电话机械股工作法等，发动职工展开了劳动竞赛，取得了一些工会工作“面向生产”的主要经验。随着邮电企业的日益恢复和发展，邮电职工的物质生活和文化生活也不断地得到改善和提高。一九五二年全国邮电职工的工资比一九四九年增加了百分之二十二点八八。一九五二年全国邮电企业修建了新宿舍十万平方公尺，一九五三年又有十五万平方公尺的新宿舍在修建。邮电职工的医疗机构、疗养院、疗养所、休养所、牛奶站、营养食堂、托儿所、哺乳室、业余学校、文化班、图书馆等各种集体福利和文化教育事业，每年都在不断增长和改善。
    李景韩在报告中检查批判了过去邮电工会工作中的缺点和错误，最后提出了在国家建设时期邮电工会组织最重要、最基本的任务：必须正确贯彻中国工会第七次全国代表大会的决议，在中国共产党领导下，联系并教育邮电职工群众，积极地完成邮电生产计划和建设计划，确保国家通信机密，开展劳动竞赛，提高邮电工作质量，发挥现有设备潜在力量，提高劳动生产率和降低企业成本，以配合国家的国防、政权、经济、文化建设和逐步满足人民通信的需要，在发展生产的基础上，逐步地改善邮电职工的物质生活与文化生活，并与全国工人阶级一道，巩固工农联盟，团结各阶层人民，为实现国家的工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。
    为了很好地完成国家建设时期邮电工会所担负的任务，李景韩指出邮电工会必须在党的领导下，结合生产和群众日常生活，对职工进行实际的共产主义教育，提高职工的觉悟程度，加强组织性，树立整体观念和集体主义精神，并开展文化、技术、业务教育，和体育娱乐活动。邮电工会必须继续加强本身的建设工作，紧紧依靠党并取得地方工会的指导和帮助，除继续加强大、中城市基层工作外，还必须加强县镇基层工作，以把全体职工团结在党的周围，使邮电工会在国家建设时期发挥更大的作用。（新华社）
