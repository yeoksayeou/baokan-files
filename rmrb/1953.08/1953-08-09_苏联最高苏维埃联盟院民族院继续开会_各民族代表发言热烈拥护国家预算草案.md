Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 8th: According to TASS, the Soviet Supreme Soviet of the Union met on the morning of August 7th to continue discussing the report on the 1953 Soviet national budget. Twelve representatives spoke at the meeting. The representatives enthusiastically supported the draft budget, which embodies the economic strength of the Soviet state, and cited vivid facts and figures to illustrate the achievements of the Soviet economy and culture.

    T. Kuliyev, representative of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, said that the Soviet national budget is a budget for peaceful construction. It powerfully demonstrates the constant concern of the Soviet government and the Communist Party for the welfare of the people and for maximizing the satisfaction of the people's material and cultural needs. The working people of Azerbaijan are very happy to welcome the financial plan of their own government and will do everything possible to complete and overfulfill the national economic plan and to implement the 1953 budget well.

    U. Yusupov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, spoke about the further development of Uzbekistan's economy and culture. He said that, for example, cotton production will almost double in the next five years compared to 1952. Yusupov pointed out the possibility of greatly expanding irrigated land and the potential for increasing yield per unit area.

    A. Kochinyan, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, said that in the first two years of the new Five-Year Plan, Armenia's industrial production increased by 30 percent, and its industrial production level in 1952 had reached more than three times that of 1940. Now, the working people of Armenia are striving to make fuller use of production equipment and their economic potential.

    In his speech, writer N. Tikhonov emphasized that one of the characteristics of the Soviet budget is the increase in budget allocations for education and culture. Then he drew the representatives' attention to another characteristic of the Soviet budget, which is the reduction of taxes. Tikhonov also spoke in detail about the tasks of art and literature workers and emphasized the great responsibility that writers and artists bear to the people. He said that the social activities of Soviet writers and their works have contributed to the universal struggle for peace and international friendship. Writers from the fraternal Soviet republics, together with literary workers from democratic countries, as well as progressive writers from the West and the East, are continuing to wage a resolute struggle with the sharp weapon of the pen against war-makers and their accomplices.

    A. Kozlov, Minister of Agriculture and Agricultural Procurement of the Soviet Union, spoke. He emphasized that the Communist Party and the Soviet government are striving to continuously improve Soviet agriculture in order to produce more food for the residents and more raw materials for light industry. For example, a large amount of funds have been allocated to further develop agriculture, especially livestock breeding and vegetable cultivation, and to supply machine tractor stations and state farms with new tractors, combines, and other latest machines. The increased budget expenditure for the implementation of these measures this year amounts to 13.6 billion rubles.

    Kozlov expressed his approval of the new agricultural tax bill. He said that the implementation of this agricultural tax law will set off a new upsurge in the work of collective farms.

    A. Tretyakov, Minister of Health of the Soviet Union, talked about the situation and development of the Soviet health care system. He said that we are focusing our efforts on preventing diseases and improving medical care. This year, the Soviet Union has allocated a large amount of funds for health care. This year, tens of thousands of beds will be added to hospitals, sanatoriums, kindergartens, and nurseries. Two thousand medical institutions are under construction, and the production of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment is increasing.

    Representatives from Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan also spoke at the meeting.

    The Soviet of the Union will hold a joint meeting with the Soviet of Nationalities at 2 p.m. on August 8th.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 8th: According to TASS, the Soviet Supreme Soviet of Nationalities held a meeting on the evening of August 7th to continue discussing the report on the 1953 Soviet national budget. Representatives of various union republics, autonomous republics, border regions, and states spoke one after another, unanimously expressing their support for the draft national budget, believing that it is a clear proof of the growing economic power of the great Soviet Union.

    P. Prokopen, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, said that the Soviet 1953 national budget is in line with the interests of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. When talking about the achievements of Karelo-Finland in the timber industry, he pointed out that the timber industry of the Karelo-Finnish Republic completed its logging plan in the fourth quarter of last year and the first half of this year. More than 80 percent of logging work has been mechanized, and the loading and unloading of timber has been almost completely mechanized. Prokopen finally talked about strengthening the training of cadres in the republic's timber industry, and criticized the shortcomings of the Soviet Ministry of Timber and Paper Industry in providing insufficient assistance in this regard.

    M. Medzhedov, representative of the Dagestan Autonomous Republic, said that the people of Dagestan wholeheartedly support the new agricultural tax bill, believing that this is a new manifestation of the Party and the government's concern for strengthening collective farms and improving the material welfare of collective farmers. They will repay this concern with new labor achievements.

    S. Akopov, Minister of the Ministry of Machine Building Industry of the Soviet Union, one of the main departments of the Soviet national economy, reported on the production of machine tools, agricultural machinery, automobiles, instruments and other various equipment at the meeting. He pointed out that now the enterprises under the ministry can produce more than 2,500 kinds of products, which are supplied to various departments of the national economy. Design engineers, together with advanced producers, continue to work hard to improve various machine tools, machines and other equipment.

    G. Burkatzkaya, chairman of the Khrushchev Collective Farm in the Kiev region of Ukraine, described the achievements of the collective farmers in the state. She said that the collective farms in the Kiev region have completed the plan for developing public livestock breeding, and milk production has exceeded the pre-war level. The income of the collective farms has increased greatly, and the public accumulation funds have also increased, so it is now possible to extensively build livestock farms, granaries, cultural palaces, clubs, radio stations, and nurseries. Burkatzkaya expressed her support for the agricultural tax bill, believing that this decree will not only promote the further improvement of the welfare of collective farmers and all residents, but also promote the comprehensive increase of agricultural products.

    The immortal friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union was clearly permeated throughout all the representatives' speeches. A. Mirtskhulava, representative of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, said that in the united family of all nationalities in our socialist motherland, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and with the active support and assistance of the great Russian people, the Georgian people have established metallurgy, chemical, machine manufacturing and other new industrial sectors, and have also achieved many great achievements in agriculture and in various aspects of political and cultural life. A. Vantsova, representative of the Lithuanian people, said that the thirteen years of life since the Lithuanian people joined the free Soviet family of nationalities have proved that the Soviet system means the continuous improvement of all material and cultural forces of all nationalities, and the rise in living standards under this system is incomparable to the living standards under the capitalist system. In the post-war Five-Year Plan, Lithuania has established more than 190 large industrial enterprises, restored the cities, factories, schools and hospitals of Lithuania destroyed by the war, and built many stadiums, libraries and scientific institutions. The victory of the collective farm system in Lithuania has opened up new vast roads for the rapid improvement of the agricultural economy. Vantsova, like other speakers, expressed her warm support for the adoption of the Soviet 1953 national budget and the new agricultural tax bill.

    The Soviet of Nationalities will hold a joint meeting with the Soviet of the Union at 2 p.m. on August 8th.
