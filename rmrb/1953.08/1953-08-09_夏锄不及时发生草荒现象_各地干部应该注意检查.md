Untimely Summer Weeding Leads to Weed Infestation; Cadres in Various Regions Should Pay Attention to Inspection

Correspondent Yu Huihai reports: According to reports from various counties in the Zibo Special District of Shandong and the Zibo Special Commissioner's Office agricultural inspection team, some areas have experienced serious weed infestation due to untimely summer weeding, hindering the normal growth of autumn crops. For example, a preliminary inspection in Zhangqiu County (now under the Tai'an Special District) revealed approximately 400 mu of weed-infested land, mostly late autumn crops such as corn and beans; Huangjia Township in Zichuan's Eighth District also had more than 100 mu of weed-infested land. The reasons for the weed infestation are mainly that cadres believe that "the elimination of wasteland has been proposed in the leadership of production over the years, and the wasteland has long been eliminated by now, and the summer weeding of the masses has also been done well this year." The actual situation is that some people are busy with sideline occupations, some are out working as laborers, and some have no labor and no ability to hire laborers, resulting in wasteland; there are also a few idlers who do not work hard and also abandon the land. According to a survey of six households in Zhangqiu's First District that did not weed, three were households with labor difficulties, one was delayed due to building a house, and two were lazy people. Therefore, at the end of the current summer weeding period, cadres in various regions should pay attention to inspecting and eliminating this weed infestation phenomenon, and strive for a bumper autumn harvest.

    夏锄不及时发生草荒现象
    各地干部应该注意检查
    通讯员于会海报道：根据山东淄博专区各县及淄博专署农业检查组的汇报，有些地区因为夏锄不及时，有严重的草荒现象，妨碍了秋禾的正常生长。如章邱县（现属泰安专区）初步检查约有四百余亩草荒地，大部分是晚秋作物玉米、豆子等；淄川八区黄家乡也有一百多亩荒地。荒地原因主要是干部认为“历年领导生产都提出消灭荒地，到现在荒地早已消灭了，今年群众的夏锄也搞得不错。”实际情况是：有的群众忙于出去搞副业，有的出去当工人，有的自己无劳力又无力雇工而荒了地；还有少数二流子不好好劳动也把地荒了。据调查章邱一区六户未锄的地，其中三户是无劳力的困难户，一户因盖房子耽误了，二户是懒汉。因此在目前夏锄结束时期，各地干部应该注意检查和消灭这种草荒现象，争取秋粮丰收。
