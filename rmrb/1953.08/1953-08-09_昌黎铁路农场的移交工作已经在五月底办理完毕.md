Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    A letter from the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government: The "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on April 29, 1953, published a letter from reader Dong Zhicheng and others, suggesting that the Ministry of Railways of the Central Government inspect the handover work of the Changli Railway Farm. We accepted this suggestion and immediately sent people to the Tianjin Railway Administration to conduct an inspection and resolve the differences of opinion that existed in the handover work. The handover of the farm was fully completed on May 31. Please inform the reader.

    中央人民政府铁道部来信：一九五三年四月二十九日“读者来信摘要”栏刊登读者董志诚等来信，建议中央铁道部检查昌黎铁路农场的移交工作。我们接受这一建议，立即派人去天津铁路管理局进行了检查，解决了移交工作中存在的不同意见。现在该场已于五月三十一日全部交接完竣，请转告读者。
