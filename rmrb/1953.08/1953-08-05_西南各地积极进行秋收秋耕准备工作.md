Southwest China: Various localities are actively preparing for the autumn harvest and autumn planting.

In Sichuan Province, early rice has begun to be harvested in the Chengdu Plain, Meishan, Leshan, Qionglai, and nine counties in southern Sichuan, including Fushun; in Yunnan Province, early rice has begun to be harvested in more than ten counties, including Yuanmou, Yuanjiang, and Pu'er. Generally, yields are higher than last year. In some areas of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, mid-season rice has flowered and is earing, nearing maturity. Generally, the rice stalks are growing strong and upright, with many plump ears. Farmers in various places are filled with joy and are actively carrying out various preparations for the autumn harvest.

The CCP Sichuan Provincial Committee conducted investigations on the preparation for the autumn harvest in Gaowu Village in Jiangjin County, the CCP Jingyan County Committee conducted investigations in Tongyi Village, and the CCP Zhongjiang County Committee conducted investigations in Village No. 1 of Longtai Township. They put forward solutions to issues such as organizing labor, reasonable assessment of work points, depreciation of farm tools, and rental of oxen, in order to correct the unreasonable phenomena in the past autumn harvest and autumn planting, such as using farm tools without compensation, not paying rent for the use of cattle, and excessively low labor wages; to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production, and to ensure timely harvesting. In preparing for the autumn harvest, various localities are further consolidating and activating mutual aid teams. Fushun County and its subordinate districts in Sichuan Province carried out key pilot work to consolidate mutual aid teams; some mutual aid teams in Longchang, Jingyan, Yibin, Luxian, the suburbs of Luzhou, Nanxi, Meishan, and other places have already formulated autumn harvest plans and are actively repairing and adding farm tools, improving the organization of labor, and arranging the order of work. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Mianzhu, Dazhu, Changshou, Daxian, Liangping and other counties in Sichuan Province are preparing to supply farmers with a large number of autumn harvest production materials. They have investigated the farmers' needs for production materials during this year's autumn harvest based on the shortcomings of the supply of production materials last autumn and during this year's spring plowing, and have formulated supply plans, adopting the method of "obtaining materials locally and supplying them locally" to organize local blacksmiths and bamboo craftsmen to manufacture farm tools. Blacksmith furnaces in Changshou County are concentrated on producing and repairing autumn harvest farm tools. Currently, the supply and marketing cooperatives in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth districts of the county have prepared 17,432 sickles, 990 loads of bamboo baskets, and more than 1,200 large and small backpacks. The Eighth District Cooperative in Daxian County organized twelve iron workers to install four iron furnaces and has produced a large number of sickles, hoes, iron rakes, etc., to ensure the supply to local farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Liangping County have organized iron furnaces and carpenters to process farm tools. Cooperatives in Changshun County and Qingping in Lushan County in Guizhou Province are also actively preparing to supply autumn harvest farm tools. In order to help some poor farmers overcome the difficulty of lacking funds to add and repair farm tools, the Jiangiang County People's Government in Sichuan Province decided to allocate 27,500 jin (catty) of relief grain (rice) to various districts and pay for the advance purchase of more than 1.7 million jin (catty) of new grain by the Grain Bureau. The People's Bank of China issued short-term loans, and the cooperatives purchased a large number of local and special products from farmers such as gallnuts. (Our Southwest Correspondent Station)

    中共四川省委在江津县高屋村、中共井研县委在同意村、中共中江县委在龙台乡一村分别进行了准备秋收工作的调查，对于组织劳动力、合理评工记分、农具折旧和耕牛租金等问题提出了解决办法，以纠正过去在秋收、秋耕中无偿使用农具、用牛不给租价、劳动力工资过低等不合理的现象；发挥农民的生产积极性，保证及时收割。各地在准备秋收中，正在进一步巩固和活跃互助组。四川省富顺县及所属各区进行了巩固互助组的重点试验工作；隆昌、井研、宜宾、泸县、泸州市郊、南溪、眉山等地部分互助组已经订立了秋收计划，正积极修补和添制农具，改进劳动力的组织，安排活路的先后次序。四川省绵竹、大竹、长寿、达县、梁平等县供销合作社为大批供应农民秋收生产资料，大都根据去年秋季和今年春耕时生产资料供应工作的缺点，调查了农民今年秋收时对生产资料的需要情况，订出了供应计划，采取“就地取材，就地供应”办法，组织当地铁匠、篾匠制造农具。长寿县各地铁匠炉都集中生产和修补秋收农具，目前该县五、六、七、八四个区供销合作社，已作好镰刀一万七千四百三十二件、箩筐九百九十担、大小夹背一千二百多个。达县八区合作社组织十二个铁工安装四盘铁炉，已生产出大批镰刀、锄头、铁耙等，保证供应当地农民的需要。梁平县各供销合作社都组织了铁炉、木工进行农具加工。贵州省长顺县、炉山县清平等地合作社，都正在积极进行供应秋收农具的准备工作。为帮助部分贫苦农民克服缺乏添置和修补农具的资金的困难，四川省夹江县人民政府决定分拨各区救济粮（大米）二万七千五百市斤，并由粮食局付款预购新粮一百七十余万斤，人民银行发放短期贷款，合作社大量收购农民的五棓子等土、特产品。  （本报西南记者站）
