Instructions of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Agricultural Tax Work in 1953
(Adopted at the 181st Meeting of the Government Administration Council on June 5, 1953)

　　Agricultural tax work over the past three years has been built on the foundation of land reform and the patriotic production increase movement, and has therefore won the support of the broad masses of farmers. Precisely because of the support of the masses of farmers, the correct leadership and full support of the CCP committees at all levels, the attention of the people's governments at all levels, and the efforts of rural cadres and financial and grain workers, the task of agricultural tax collection has been basically completed, playing an extremely important role in balancing the national budget, regulating the market, stabilizing grain prices, ensuring military and civilian food supplies, and providing disaster relief. In the implementation of the agricultural tax law, over the past three years, the tax law has been revised based on the principles of reasonable burden and encouragement of production increase and the development of the rural economy. The policy of stipulating normal annual yields, calculating taxes according to rates, reducing and exempting taxes according to law, and not increasing taxes on increased production has been gradually implemented, so that the burden on farmers has gradually become more reasonable, thereby gradually stabilizing and increasing farmers' enthusiasm for production. However, on the other hand, there are still many shortcomings and errors in agricultural tax work. The most significant is that the publicity for the agricultural tax policy and the methods for completing the collection task is insufficient, and the explanation is unclear. When checking whether the collection task has been completed, little attention is paid to the implementation of the policy, which has fueled the commandist style of some cadres. There is insufficient understanding of the unbalanced nature of China's rural economy, and insufficient understanding of the fact that the formulation of agricultural taxes must be adapted to local conditions. Although there are various tax rates across the country, there is still a general tendency, which cannot fully adapt to the specific conditions of the rural economy in various parts of the country. There are also errors in the practice of land surveying and yield determination. It has neither based itself on the land yields assessed by the masses during land reform and the habit of farmers' burdens over the years, nor has it relied well on the local farmers. Therefore, the determined acreage yields are not completely suitable for the specific conditions of the local area, and there are phenomena of being too high or too low. Some of the regulations in the reduction and exemption methods are too complicated. Although the total amount of reduction and exemption across the country is very large, it has still failed to effectively and reasonably solve the problem. The setting of grain depots is not appropriate, and the work of transporting grain into the depots lacks specific guidance and in-depth inspection, so that there are still casualties of people and animals. Some areas have done a better job in completing the collection task and transporting grain into the depots, but they have not promptly summarized their experiences and promoted them. The grain that is extremely difficult to transport out of remote mountainous areas has not been dealt with in a timely manner, and a batch of old grain is still accumulated until now and has not been properly disposed of. These shortcomings and errors must be strictly corrected. To this end, the following instructions are made for the agricultural tax work in 1953:

　　1. The guiding principle and policy for collecting agricultural tax: We must follow Chairman Mao's general policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply," and determine the quota figures for collecting public grain based on the needs of the country and the specific conditions of farmers' production development, and resolutely implement the fair and reasonable burden policy of "how much land is cultivated, how much grain should be produced, taxes calculated according to rates, reductions and exemptions according to law, and no increase in taxes on increased production" to encourage production increase. In the next three years, the agricultural tax collection quota should be stabilized at the level of actual collection in 1952 and will not be increased. This is a policy that allows farmers to recuperate and will greatly stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production and increase crop yields, thereby further developing the rural economy. People's governments at all levels and financial and grain workers must act realistically and in accordance with the policy, both to implement the policy that reductions and exemptions must be given where they are due, that there is no increase in burden with increased production, and that it is conducive to the development of agricultural production, and also to ensure that what should be collected must be collected, and what should not be reduced or exempted must not be reduced or exempted, in order to ensure the completion of the agricultural tax collection task. It is wrong to act unrealistically and not in accordance with the policy, whether the quota figures are reached or exceeded, or not reached. The policy must be observed, and the task must also be guaranteed to be completed. The two are unified, and the view that the task and the policy are opposed to each other is wrong and must be changed.

　　2. The agricultural tax rate for 1953 will generally be implemented according to the tax rate of 1952. However, if the provincial and municipal people's governments believe that the tax rate set last year is indeed not suitable for the specific conditions of the local area, they may formulate another one, report it to the administrative committee of the greater administrative region for approval and implementation, and report it to the Central Ministry of Finance for record. The animal husbandry tax in ethnic minority areas should be studied and appropriately adjusted based on the principles of rewarding livestock breeding, improving livestock breeds, and improving the lives of herdsmen, and the collection method should be simplified as much as possible to suit the lives of the pastoral areas. The agricultural tax method cannot be moved to the pastoral areas.

　　3. In order to implement a fair and reasonable burden policy that encourages increased production, public grain collection must be handled separately according to different conditions in various places. In areas where land surveying and yield determination has not been completed or carried out, land surveying and yield determination should generally be stopped. The standard for public grain collection can be adjusted and stipulated based on the materials of the field yield appraised by the masses during the land reform in various places and the preliminary survey of field yield in the grain collection work over the years, with reference to the local production situation of the year, and through democratic appraisal by the masses. In areas where land surveying and yield determination has been implemented, those whose past yield determination is too light or too heavy, resulting in dissatisfaction among the masses, need to be adjusted. Those that are too low can be increased, and those that are too high must be lowered, but all must be carried out step by step and cannot be rushed. Significant imbalances still exist between provinces and provinces, counties and counties, and townships and townships, and these should also be appropriately adjusted. After the adjustment, the field yield for agricultural tax will be announced as fixed. In areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated or mixed communities, land surveying and yield determination should not be carried out. The burden method can only be gradually improved on the basis of the customary burden method, combined with the specific conditions of the local area and the actual needs of the masses, and generally the burden should be gradually fixed. Fixing the field yield and tax rate for agricultural tax calculation can realize what Chairman Mao once instructed: "So that farmers can calculate the amount of tax to be paid according to the quantity and quality of their cultivated land. With this calculation, farmers can calculate the proportion of their annual household income and expenditure, and can freely engage in production, increase their enthusiasm for production, and guarantee the increase in grain production; and the government will not have unfair problems when collecting taxes." (On Economic and Financial Problems) The fixing of agricultural tax field yield in each province should be reported by the provincial and municipal people's governments to the administrative committee of the greater administrative region for approval and forwarded to the Central Ministry of Finance for record.

　　4. Doing a good job in legally reducing and exempting taxes is one of the key issues in grain collection work. The scope of agricultural tax reduction and exemption is divided into two categories according to different properties: one is "disaster reduction and exemption," that is, reducing and exempting the burden of disaster-stricken farmers according to the number of years of poor harvest due to natural disasters. The principle is "small disaster, small reduction, heavy disaster, large reduction, and special heavy, full exemption." The other is "social reduction and exemption." The scope of reduction and exemption includes: (1) farmers who have no labor force or lack labor force and have difficulty in life; (2) farmers who suffer unexpected disasters or have difficulties in paying taxes due to other reasons; (3) old revolutionary base areas that have suffered war wounds or have been severely destroyed by the enemy and whose production has not yet recovered; (4) areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities and have difficulty in life; (5) remote and extremely poor mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation; (6) other areas that the provincial and municipal people's governments deem it necessary to take care of.

　　Implementing the reduction and exemption policy has a great impact on taking care of the suffering of farmers and improving the relationship between the government and farmers. We must absorb the past experiences and lessons, and correct the two deviations of not reducing when it should be reduced, not exempting when it should be exempted, or reducing when it should not be reduced and exempting when it should not be exempted. In order to ensure the implementation of the reduction and exemption policy, the reduction and exemption methods must be announced to the public and widely publicized, so that every household knows it; when determining the reduction and exemption households, the method of "in-depth investigation, mass appraisal, and government verification" should be widely adopted.

　　The reduction and exemption methods should be simplified as much as possible. The central government only stipulates general principles, and the provincial and municipal people's governments formulate implementation methods according to the specific conditions of the local area and report them to the administrative committee of the greater administrative region for approval and forwarding to the Central Ministry of Finance for record.

　　5. Transporting grain into the warehouse is the final and most intense stage of grain collection work. To reduce and eliminate liability accidents of human and animal casualties, the successful experience in transporting grain into the warehouse must be promoted, and the following four issues must be properly resolved: (1) Appropriately set up grain depots, which must not only facilitate the state's allocation and transportation of grain, but also take into account the difficulties of farmers in sending grain. The mileage of farmers' voluntary transportation should generally be such that the grain senders can make a round trip in one day, except for the northwest, Inner Mongolia, and other areas with special circumstances. The specific number of miles can be stipulated separately by the provincial and municipal people's governments according to local conditions. The transportation and allocation of grain vary from place to place. How to set up and manage warehouses, except for the warehouses directly controlled by the central government, is generally determined by the provincial and municipal people's governments according to local transportation conditions and grain allocation conditions. The central government does not make uniform regulations. However, in general areas, in addition to setting up large warehouses along transportation lines, it is advisable to set up one to several medium-sized warehouses according to the district. Individual remote townships (villages) may set up small warehouses at their discretion. Grain collection has already begun this year. If there is no time to build new warehouses in some areas, temporary grain collection stations can be appropriately added to facilitate farmers to send grain. (2) Strengthen leadership and strictly organize transportation. Conscientiously do a good job in organizing the transportation capacity of townships (villages), do a good job in surveying and repairing roads and bridges, protecting safe driving, and do a good job in the warehouse's grain collection work. (3) Appropriately arrange the grain transportation time and do not squeeze the grain transportation time of various places together. (4) Strengthen the management of grain warehouses to reduce losses.

　　6. Other specific issues are stipulated as follows:

　　A. The old grain that is still accumulated in remote mountainous areas should be disposed of quickly. First of all, actively take all possible measures to transport out as much as possible that can be transported out; if it cannot be transported out, sell as much as possible that can be sold locally; if it cannot be transported out and cannot be sold locally, it can be used to exchange for local products, issue agricultural loans, run small-scale local public welfare undertakings, or allocate it for relief, etc. The relevant provincial people's government should propose practical and feasible disposal methods and report them to the administrative committee of the greater administrative region for approval and implementation.

　　B. The proportion of grain, industrial raw materials, and cash in the total amount of agricultural tax collection must be stipulated according to the principle of "national needs and people's resources" and according to specific circumstances. No or less grain should be collected in industrial raw material areas and grain-deficient areas; in grain-producing areas, all or more grain should be collected. According to past experience, it is necessary to divide districts and provinces from top to bottom to stipulate the quota ratio figures for collecting grain, industrial raw materials, and cash, but some flexibility should be given to various places in the implementation. When major changes need to be made according to specific circumstances, the provincial and municipal people's governments may report to the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council for approval and change. The conversion rate of various grains collected and the pricing of cash in lieu of tax can be calculated by each province and city based on the local main grain production as the standard, in principle according to the local market average price, but it must be fair and reasonable, so as not to reduce the country's income and take care of the interests of farmers. The specifications for collecting public grain can generally be based on the local average grain of the year as the standard, but it must be dried and cleaned to ensure quality. The specific specifications are stipulated by the provincial and municipal people's governments.

　　C. The collection method for agricultural production cooperatives shall be determined by the provincial and municipal people's governments with reference to last year's method, as appropriate.

　　D. The finance section of each county people's government should add an appropriate number of agricultural tax workers and include them in the establishment to be specifically responsible.

　　Finally, it must be emphasized once again the importance of agricultural tax to the country. In the past revolutionary war period, it was our main source of income. In the past three years, it is also because we have completed the collection of public grain that we have smoothly guaranteed the balance of national revenue and expenditure, the needs of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and the stability of market prices. In the future, with the development of industry, although the proportion of agricultural tax in the country's total income will relatively decrease day by day, it will always be a huge income for the country and a major guarantee for stabilizing market prices and supplying military and civilian food. At present, the amount of commercial grain needed by our country every year is increasing day by day. In the future, ensuring the supply of grain needed by cities and industrial and mining areas, economic crop areas, and disaster areas will be a regular and major political task. People's governments at all levels must attach the same importance to the collection of agricultural tax as in the past, and always pay attention to preventing the possible tendency to neglect the collection of agricultural tax. In the collection of agricultural tax, we must fully estimate the production enthusiasm and patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers who have been improved through various movements such as land reform, production mutual assistance and cooperation, and patriotic education. As long as we can rely on the broad masses of farmers and give play to the enthusiasm of party and government organs at all levels and village cadres, the task of collecting public grain will definitely be successfully completed.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于一九五三年农业税工作的指示
    （一九五三年六月五日政务院第一百八十一次政务会议通过）
    三年来农业税工作，是建立在土地改革和爱国增产运动的基础之上的，因而获得了广大农民的拥护。正由于农民群众的拥护，中共各级党委的正确领导和全力支持，各级人民政府的重视，以及农村干部和财粮工作人员的努力，基本上完成了农业税的征收任务，对于平衡国家预算、调剂市场、稳定粮价、保证军需民食和救济灾荒等方面，起了极重大作用。在农业税法的执行上，三年来根据合理负担、鼓励增产的原则和农村经济发展的情况，修订了税法，并逐步推行了规定常年应产量、依率计征、依法减免、增产不增税的政策，使农民负担逐渐趋于合理，从而逐步稳定和提高了农民生产情绪。但另一方面，在农业税工作中，还存在着许多缺点与错误。其最显著的是对农业税政策和完成征收任务的方法，宣传不够，交代不清，检查征收任务完成与否时，很少注意政策的执行情况，因而助长了某些干部强迫命令的作风。对中国农村经济不平衡性认识不足，对制定农业税必须因地制宜了解不够，虽然现在全国有各种不同税率，但仍有一般化的倾向，不能完全适应全国各地农村经济的具体情况。查田定产的作法亦有错误，它既未能依据各地土地改革时群众评定的和历年农民负担习惯的地亩产量做基础，又未很好依靠当地农民群众，因而查定的亩数产量不完全适合当地的具体情况，存在着偏高偏低现象。减免办法中有些规定过于繁复，全国减免总额虽然很大，但仍然未能有效地合理地解决问题。粮库的设置不尽适中，运粮入库工作，缺乏具体指导与深入检查，以致仍有人畜伤亡的现象；有些地区完成征收任务和运粮入库工作做的比较好，亦未及时总结经验，加以推广。对于偏僻山区极难运出的粮食，处理不及时，直到现在还积存一批陈粮，未作适当处理。以上这些缺点和错误必须严加纠正。为此，对一九五三年的农业税工作特作如下的指示：
    一、征收农业税的方针政策：必须按照毛主席所指示的“发展经济，保障供给”的总方针，根据国家的需要和农民生产发展的具体情况来决定征收公粮的指标数字，并坚决实行“种多少田地，应产多少粮食，依率计征，依法减免，增产不增税”的公平合理、鼓励增产的负担政策。今后三年内，农业税的征收指标，应稳定在一九五二年实际征收的水平上，不再增加。这是使农民得以休养生息的政策，必将大大地刺激农民的生产积极性和增加农作物的产量，从而进一步发展农村经济。各级人民政府和财粮工作人员必须实事求是地按照政策办事，既要贯彻该减免的必须减免，增加产量不增加负担，有利于发展农业生产的政策，又要做到该征的必须征到，不该减免的不得减免，以保证农业税征收任务的完成。不实事求是地按照政策办事，无论达到或超过指标数字，或达不到指标数字，都是错误的。政策必须遵守，任务也要保证完成，两者是统一的，把任务和政策对立起来的看法是错误的，必须改变。
    二、一九五三年的农业税税率，一般仍按一九五二年的税率执行。但各省、市人民政府如认为去年所订税率确有不适合当地具体情况者，可另行拟订，报经大区行政委员会批准施行，并报中央财政部备案。少数民族地区的牧业税，应根据奖励繁殖牲畜、改良畜种和改善牧民生活的原则加以研究，适当调整，并使征收办法尽量简化，以与畜区生活相适应，不能把农业税的一套办法搬到牧区中去。
    三、为了贯彻公平合理及鼓励增产的负担政策，今后征收公粮必须按照各地不同情况分别处理，在未完成或未进行查田定产地区一般应停止进行查田定产工作，公粮征收标准可根据各地土地改革时群众评定的和历年征粮工作中初步调查的田亩产量材料，参照当地当年生产丰歉情况，并通过群众民主评议，加以调整和规定。在已推行查田定产的地区，过去定产有畸轻畸重以致引起群众不满者，需加调整，过低的可以提高，过高的必须降低，但均须有步骤地进行，不可操之过急；对省与省、县与县、乡与乡之间还存在着显著不平衡的现象，亦应加以适当的调整；调整后，即宣布固定其农业税的田亩产量。少数民族聚居或杂居的地区，不应进行查田定产，其负担办法只能在习惯负担办法的基础上，结合当地具体情况和群众的实际要求，逐步加以改进，一般地也应逐渐将负担固定下来。把农业税计征的田亩产量和税率固定下来，这样，就可以实现毛主席曾指示过的：“使农民能够按照自己耕地的量和质计算交税数目。农民有了这个计算，就可计算他全年全家收支的比例，就可放手进行生产，而增加生产积极性，保证粮食的增产；政府征税时就不发生不公平的问题了。”（论经济问题和财政问题）各省农业税田亩产量的固定应由省、市人民政府报经大区行政委员会批准并转中央财政部备案。
    四、做好依法减免工作，这是征粮工作中关键问题之一。农业税减免范围，按不同性质分为两类：一类是“灾情减免”，即按自然灾害歉收成数减免受灾农户的负担，原则是“轻灾少减，重灾多减，特重全免”。一类是“社会减免”，减免范围包括：（一）无劳动力或缺乏劳动力而生活困难的农户；（二）遭受意外灾害或由于其他原因而交税确有困难的农户；（三）遭受战争创伤或敌人摧残严重而生产尚未恢复的革命老根据地；（四）少数民族聚居而生活困难的地区；（五）交通不便特别贫苦的山区；（六）各省、市人民政府认为有必要加以照顾的其他地区。
    贯彻减免政策，对照顾农民疾苦、改善政府与农民的关系影响极大，必须吸收过去的经验教训，纠正该减不减、该免不免，或不该减也减、不该免也免两种偏向。为求减免政策的贯彻执行，必须将减免办法布告周知，广为宣传，做到家喻户晓；在确定减免户时，应普遍采用“深入调查，群众评议，政府核定”的方法。
    减免办法应力求简化，中央只规定一般原则，由各省、市人民政府根据当地具体情况制定实施办法报大区行政委员会批准转报中央财政部备案。
    五、运粮入库，是征粮工作中最后的也是最紧张的一段工作。要减少与消灭人畜伤亡责任事故，必须推广运粮入库工作中成功的经验，并妥善解决下列四个问题：（一）适当设置粮库，既要便利国家调运粮食，又要照顾农民送粮中的困难。农民义务运输的里程，除西北、内蒙及其他情况特殊的地区外，一般应做到使送粮者一天能够来回，具体里数可由省市人民政府按当地情况分别规定。各地运输和调拨粮食情况不一，仓库如何设置和如何管理，除中央直接控制的仓库外，一般均由各省、市人民政府按照当地交通运输条件与粮食调拨情况自定办法，中央不作统一规定。但一般地区除沿交通线设大仓库外，以按区设一个至数个中等仓库为宜。个别偏僻遥远乡（村）得酌设小仓库。今年征粮已经开始，有些地区如来不及修建新仓，可适当增设临时收粮站，以便农民送粮。（二）加强领导，严密组织运输。认真做好乡（村）运输力的组织工作，做好勘修道路桥梁、保护安全行驶的工作，并做好仓库的收粮工作。（三）适当安排运粮时间，不要把各地运粮入库时间挤在一起。（四）加强粮食仓库的保管工作，减少损耗。
    六、其他几个具体问题，规定如下：
    甲、对现仍积存在偏僻山区的陈粮，应迅速处理。首先是积极采取一切可能的办法，将能运出的尽量运出；确实不能运出而能就地销售的尽量就地销售；不能运出又不能就地销售的可用以交换土产、发放农贷、举办小型的地方公益事业或拨作救济等，由有关省人民政府提出切实可行的处理办法，报大区行政委员会批准施行。
    乙、在农业税征收总额中的粮食、工业原料和代金的比例，必须根据“国需民有”的原则，按具体情况规定。在工业原料区和缺粮区不征或少征粮食；在产粮地区则应全征或多征粮食。根据历年经验，自上而下地分区分省规定征收粮食、工业原料和代金的指标比例数字是必要的，但在执行中应给各地一定的机动权。根据具体情况须作较大变更时，可由省、市人民政府报请政务院财政经济委员会核准予以更改。所征各种粮食的折合率和折征代金的作价，可由各省、市以当地生产的主要粮食为标准，原则上按当地市场平均价格计算，但必须做到公平合理，务使不减少国家的收入，又照顾农民的利益。征收公粮的规格，一般可依照当地当年中等粮食为标准，但必须晒干扬净，保证质量。具体规格由各省、市人民政府规定。
    丙、农业生产合作社的征收办法，由各省、市人民政府参照去年的办法酌情规定。
    丁、各县人民政府财政科应增设适当数量的农业税工作人员，列入编制，以专责成。
    最后，必须再一次着重指出，农业税对于国家的重要性。在过去革命战争时期，它是我们收入的主要来源。近三年来也因为我们完成了公粮的征收，才顺利地保障了国家收支的平衡，抗美援朝的需要和市场物价的稳定。在今后，随着工业的发展，农业税在国家总收入中所占的比重，虽相对地日渐缩小，但它始终是国家的巨大收入和稳定市场物价、供应军需民食的重大保障。目前我们国家每年需要的商品粮食日益增大，今后保证城市及工矿区、经济作物区以及灾区所需的粮食供应，将是一个经常的重大的政治任务，各级人民政府对于农业税的征收工作必须同过去一样重视，并随时注意防止可能产生的忽视农业税征收工作的偏向。在农业税的征收工作中，必须充分估计到广大农民经过土地改革生产互助合作等各项运动和爱国主义教育而提高了的生产积极性和爱国热忱，只要能依靠广大农民群众，发挥各级党政机关与乡村干部的积极性，征收公粮的任务是一定能胜利完成的。
