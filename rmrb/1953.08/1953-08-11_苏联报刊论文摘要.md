Abstracts of Soviet Newspaper Articles

The Method of Persuasion

The "Labor News" published an article by Kuchin, chairman of the trade union committee of the Soviet "Azov Steel Factory" on July 18, which pointed out the importance of the method of persuasion in trade union work. The abstract is as follows:

The method of persuasion is the main method of trade union work. Trade union leaders must be good at organizing people, leading people, and using mass influence methods. This is the key to the success of all institutions.

Trade union organizations should not turn a blind eye to the behavior of individual staff members who violate labor discipline and fail to complete quotas. Life has proven that administrative measures alone cannot stop these old remnants of thought and behavior. In places where administrative means are simply liked and educational work and methods of persuasion are ignored, there will be no excellent results.

Educational work is a complex, arduous, and long-term process. A person's character cannot be changed overnight, and a single method cannot rid a person of his old habits.

The method of persuasion should be based on the principle of treating people separately and abolishing the rigid formula in educational work. To achieve success in this area, it is necessary to take into account the age, occupation, life experience, and education level of each member of the collective. Another necessary condition is to not give up halfway, but to carry out the work that has been started to the end, sparing no time and energy to achieve the goal.

When it comes to educational work, it is usually thought of as referring to young people. Of course, this is incorrect. Adults must also be educated, including those who were once experienced staff members, or even advanced producers, but who have later fallen behind in the general level of improvement.

It often happens that in order to educate a person, it is necessary to seek help from his family. For example, at the meeting of the trade union group leaders in our factory, the phenomenon of extreme indiscipline of sand casting worker Ya. Mikhailov was discussed many times. He consistently failed to complete the orders of the group leader and often left his post. Criticism of him at the conference did not have any effect. So Comrade Fedyushkin, the trade union group leader, sent an activist to his home. It turned out that Mikhailov was often complained about at home because of his low wages, but no one at home mentioned that his work was not good. The factory activist explained the crux of the problem to his family members. Everyone worked together to push Mikhailov. He began to improve his work. Naturally, his salary also increased.

Planned publicity and the adoption of the advanced experience of innovators is a good way to carry out persuasion work. In our factory, schools that teach advanced labor methods on the spot are widely welcomed. In these schools, production innovators talk about their various achievements. Practice has proved that students who participate in this type of school have increased their labor productivity by 10 to 13 percent.

Improve the Trade Work of Consumer Cooperatives

The "News" published an article by Khokhlov, chairman of the Central Union Council of Soviet Consumer Cooperatives, on improving the trade work of consumer cooperatives on June 23. The abstract is as follows:

This year, the Soviet government has passed a series of decisions to make a large additional increase in the production of many commodities urgently needed by residents and collective farms. The influx of these commodities into the commercial network has expanded the variety of existing commodities. In this case, the further development of commodity circulation mainly depends on whether salespeople, stacks and warehouse staff are good at correctly organizing business, considering the requirements of buyers, and meeting them in a timely manner.

Many consumer cooperatives have not required factories to produce the goods needed by residents. They often accept unsalable goods from industry and transport excessive goods to certain commercial enterprises, but there is a shortage of goods in other commercial enterprises. One of the main reasons for this phenomenon is the lack of research on the needs of residents.

Many consumer cooperatives have not yet implemented the pre-purchase system well. They do not estimate existing inventory and residents' needs when creating order forms. After completing the ordering procedures, the staff of the consumer cooperatives do not strive for the industrial sector to fulfill the contract conditions, and they often adopt a conciliatory attitude towards the most serious violations of the commodity supply period, category, color, and size.

Commercial organizations have the right to refuse to accept and pay for goods that have not been ordered and do not meet the supply conditions, but in many cases, they have not exercised this power. This shows that commercial organizations are unwilling to argue with suppliers. This situation in consumer cooperatives should be severely criticized.

To further develop commodity circulation, it is necessary to thoroughly improve the work of wholesale enterprises. These enterprises are responsible for ensuring the timely and planned supply of various commodities needed by the retail commercial network. The staff of wholesale enterprises must better study the situation of retail business and the needs of residents, pay attention to the inventory of each store, estimate this situation when supplying goods, and actively participate in effectively organizing Soviet business.

Many wholesale stacks and warehouses have serious shortcomings in their work. Their work does not serve the development of retail commodity circulation. Some consumer cooperative wholesale department staff often think that once the wholesale commodity circulation plan has been completed, the task is over, and they are no longer responsible. At the same time, when completing the wholesale commodity circulation plan, in order to pursue figures, they often ship goods that do not meet the order form, and ignore the reasonable requirements of consumer cooperatives for the supply of certain goods, which are essential for maintaining a regular store's variety of goods.

Most consumer cooperatives, especially some individual stores, have not completed the commodity circulation plan. This is mainly because many consumer cooperative leaders did not directly participate in the preparation of the commodity circulation plan and did not supervise the implementation of these plans. Some people have forgotten that the completion of the retail commodity circulation plan ultimately depends on the store, grocery store and tea house. Therefore, attention should be focused on the work of retail enterprises, and they should be given the necessary help in developing and improving business, and the experience of the best salespeople and the collective experience of various commercial enterprises should be promoted.

Consumer cooperatives are responsible for purchasing a large amount of meat, milk, eggs, fruits, vegetables and other agricultural products from collective farms and farmers through the vast branches scattered across the country, and improving the supply to residents and increasing the volume of commodity circulation through the sale of these goods.

Now, all consumer cooperatives should understand that purchasing agricultural products and thereby absorbing more food resources into commodity circulation is their direct task.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    说服的方法
    “劳动报”七月十八日刊载了苏联“亚速钢铁工厂”工会委员会主席库琴的论文，其中指出说服的方法，在工会工作上的重要性，摘要如下：
    说服的方法是工会工作的主要方法。工会领导者要善于组织人们、带动人们，善于使用群众感化的方法，这是一切机构的工作成绩的关键所在。
    工会组织对于个别工作人员破坏劳动纪律、没有完成定额的行为，不应采取置之不理的态度。生活证明：仅仅用行政手段不能终止这类旧的残余思想和行为。在单是喜欢使用行政手段，忽视教育工作和说服方法的地方，是不会有优良的成绩的。
    教育工作是一个复杂的、艰苦的和长期的过程。人的性格不能一下子改变，单是一种办法不能使人摆脱他的旧习惯。
    说服的方法要以分别对待人，废止教育工作中的刻板公式为原则。要在这方面获得成绩，必须顾及集体中每个成员的年龄、职业、生活经验和教育程度。另外还有一个必要的条件，就是不要半途而废，而要把已开始的工作贯彻到底，为达到目的，毫不吝惜时间和精力。
    一说到教育工作，通常总认为指的是对青年。当然，这是不正确的，对成年人也必须进行教育，其中包括那些曾经一度表现为有经验的工作人员，甚至曾是先进生产者，而后来又在一般水平的提高中间显得落后了的人们。
    常有这样的情况：为了教育一个人还须求助于他的家属。例如，在我们工厂的工会小组长会议上，曾经多次地讨论了关于翻砂间工人亚·米海耶夫极端不守纪律的现象。他一贯地完不成小组长的命令，经常离开自己的工作岗位。在大会上对他的批评也没有发生任何的效果。于是工会小组长费久什金同志派了一个积极分子到他的家里去。结果发现米海耶夫常在家里受埋怨，为的是工资少，可是家里谁也没有提到过他的工作不好。工厂的积极分子向他的家庭成员说明了问题的关键。大家共同努力推动了米海耶夫。他开始改进了工作。自然，他的工资也就提高了。
    有计划地宣传和采用革新者的先进经验是进行说服工作的一个良好方式。在我们工厂里，实地讲授先进劳动方法的学校受到广泛的欢迎，在这些学校里，生产革新者们讲述着他们的各种成就。实践证明，参加这种学校的学生，都把他们的劳动生产率提高了百分之十到十三。
    改进消费合作社的贸易工作
    “消息报”六月二十三日发表了苏联消费合作社中央联盟理事会主席豪赫洛夫所作的论改进消费合作社贸易工作的论文，摘要如下：
    苏联政府今年通过了一系列的决定，使居民和各集体农庄所迫切需要的许多商品的生产有额外的大量增加。这些商品的流入商业网，扩大了现有商品的种类。在此种情况下，商品流转的进一步发展，主要依靠售货员、堆栈和仓库工作人员善于正确组织商业，考虑买主的要求，并及时予以满足。
    很多消费合作社没有要求各工厂生产居民所需要的商品，它们经常从工业中接受一些没有销路的货物，并把过多的商品向某些商业企业中运去，其实，在另外一些商业企业中却是缺货的。造成这种现象的主要原因之一，是在对居民的需求缺乏研究。
    很多消费合作社还没有很好地实行预购制度，在造订货单时并不估计现有存货和居民的需求。在完成订货手续之后，消费合作社的工作人员也不争取工业方面履行合同条件，而对最严重地破坏商品供应期限、品类、花色、尺寸的现象，经常采取调和的态度。
    商业组织有权拒绝接收和偿付未经订购的、不合于供售条件的商品，但在很多情况下，它们并未行使这种职权。这说明了商业组织不愿同供应货物者发生争吵。消费合作社里的这种情况，应当受到严厉的批评。
    要进一步发展商品流转，就必须彻底改进批发企业的工作。这些企业负有责任来保证及时地、有计划地将所需的各种商品供应零售商业网。批发企业的工作人员必须更好地研究零售商业的情况和居民的需求，注意各个商店的存货，在供应商品时估计到这种情况，并积极参加有效地组织苏维埃商业的工作。
    许多批发栈和仓库，在工作上存在着严重的缺点。它们的工作没有为发展零售商品的流转服务。一些消费合作社批发部门的工作人员时常认为商品的批发流转计划一经完成，任务就已结束，他们不再负有任何责任。同时，在完成批发商品流转计划的时候，为了追求数字，它们常运出一些不符合订货单的商品，忽视消费合作社请求供应某些货品的合理要求，而这些商品对于维持一个正规的商店的货品花色却是十分必需的。
    大多数的消费合作社，特别是某些个别商店没有完成商品流转计划。这主要是因为很多消费合作社的领导者没有直接参加商品流转计划的编制，没有监督这些计划的执行。有些人忘记了零售商品流转计划的完成，归根结底决定于商店、杂货铺和茶馆，因此，应当把注意力集中于零售企业的工作，而在发展和改进商业方面，给它们以必要的帮助，并应推广最好的售货员的经验和各商业企业的集体经验。
    消费合作社负有责任通过散布全国的广阔分支机构，向集体农庄和农民收购大量的肉品、牛奶、鸡蛋、果品、蔬菜和其他农产品，并通过这些货品的出售来改进对居民的供应和增大商品流转量。
    现在，所有的消费合作社都应当了解收购农产品，由此吸收更多的食品资源加入商品流转，乃是他们的直接任务。
