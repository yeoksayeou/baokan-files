Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th – The various bodies established under the Korean Armistice Agreement have, after a week of busy meetings since July 28th, basically completed the arrangements for establishing the organizations and administrative details. The Military Armistice Commission agreed to adjourn at its meeting on the 5th. According to the Armistice Agreement, during the adjournment period, which shall not exceed seven days, the meeting shall reconvene upon notification by either party the day before. At the same time, the repatriation of prisoners of war began at Panmunjom at 9:00 a.m. on the 5th, and work is underway to establish the demilitarized zone and supervise the armistice.

All indications are that the Military Armistice Commission has begun to shift from arranging the administrative details of the post-armistice work to supervising the implementation of the Armistice Agreement.

During the adjournment of the Military Armistice Commission, staff officers from both sides will continue to meet in two groups, one to discuss measures to remove dangerous objects from the demilitarized zone, and the other to discuss the construction of headquarters of the Military Armistice Committee, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

At the Military Armistice Commission meetings over the past week, both sides notified that all military personnel from each side had been withdrawn from the demilitarized zone. The U.S. side also claimed that all troops under U.S. control had completely withdrawn from all islands stipulated in Item 13(c) of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Our chief commissioner, General Li Sang-cho, successively pointed out fourteen incidents of violations of the Armistice Agreement by the U.S. side and requested the U.S. side to pay attention. The U.S. chief commissioner, Mr. Brian, has acknowledged two violations of the Armistice Agreement by the U.S. side and agreed to have them handled by the secretaries-general of both sides. One was the intrusion and reconnaissance of our airspace by a U.S. military aircraft on the morning of July 29, and the other was the crossing of the military demarcation line by U.S. troops on August 4.

The Military Armistice Commission has approved the agreement of the staff meeting on the specifications of the markers of the military demarcation line and their erection and supervision methods. The joint observer groups Nos. 3 to 10 dispatched by the Military Armistice Commission met successively in their respective designated sections before August 2 and began to carry out their tasks. Each group will be responsible for supervising the establishment of markers on the military demarcation line and the northern and southern edges of the demilitarized zone, as well as removing dangerous objects from the demilitarized zone. Joint observer groups Nos. 1 and 2, responsible for the Han River estuary area, will begin work after the Military Armistice Commission formulates regulations on the management of shipping in the Han River estuary.

The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will meet on the morning of the 6th, inviting the chief commissioners of the Korean-Chinese side and the United Nations Command side of the Military Armistice Commission to attend, to clarify issues such as transportation, communication, and personnel safety of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams sent to the rear ports of both sides, in order to finalize the departure dates of the teams.

The members of the twenty Neutral Nations Inspection Teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission met at Panmunjom at 5:00 p.m. on the 5th. The ten teams sent to the rear ports of both sides are each composed of eight officers, with two officers appointed by each of the four neutral nations. After the departure date is determined, each team will immediately go to its designated port to carry out its mission to supervise the cessation of the entry of reinforcing military personnel, combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea. The other ten mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Teams will remain at headquarters on standby. The emblems of each team were determined at the meeting of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the 4th.

The Prisoner of War Repatriation Commission has held eight meetings in recent days, and after exchanging the text of the "Understanding on Administrative Details of Repatriation of Prisoners of War" on the 4th, it completed the preparations for the repatriation of prisoners of war starting today. The joint Red Cross teams, the North Team and the South Team, have departed from Panmunjom according to the agreement between the two sides, and went separately to visit the prisoner of war camps under the management of both sides, to comfort the prisoners of war and distribute gifts, and to provide services for the prisoners of war en route. A subgroup of the North Team remained in Kaesong, a subgroup of the South Team remained in Munsan to work, and the central group began work in the handover area of both sides at Panmunjom on the 5th. The coordination group in Panmunjom will consult on the work of the North, Central, and South teams at any time.

    朝鲜军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会
    开始转入监督停战协定的实施
    【新华社开城五日电】根据朝鲜停战协定设立的各机构，经过从七月二十八日起一周来繁忙的会议活动，已基本上完成建立机构及行政细节的安排。军事停战委员会在五日会议上同意休会。按照停战协定规定，在不超过七天的休会期间，会议在任何一方于前一天通知后即应重新召开。与此同时，战俘遣返工作已从五日上午九时在板门店开始，关于建立非军事区及监督停战的各项工作均在进行中。
    一切迹象显示，军事停战委员会已从进行停战后各项工作的行政细节的安排，开始转入监督停战协定的实施。
    军事停战委员会休会期间，双方参谋人员将继续分两组开会，一组讨论从非军事区清除危险物的措施，一组讨论军事停战委员会、中立国监察委员会和中立国遣返委员会的总部修建问题。
    在军事停战委员会一周来的会议上，双方通知：各方的军事人员已全部撤出非军事区：美方并声称美方控制下的一切军队，已完全撤离朝鲜停战协定第十三款丑项所规定的一切岛屿。我方首席委员李相朝将军，曾先后指出美方的十四起违反停战协定的事件，要求美方注意。美方首席委员勃里安已承认美方的两起违反停战协定的事件，并同意由双方秘书长进行处理。一件是美国军用飞机在七月二十九日晨侵入我方上空盘旋侦察，另一件是美军在八月四日越过军事分界线。
    军事停战委员会已批准参谋会议关于军事分界线标志物的规格及其树立和监督办法的协议。军事停战委员会派出的联合观察小组第三组至第十组，在八月二日以前，已先后在各指定地段内会晤，开始执行任务。各组将负责监督军事分界线及非军事区南北两缘标志物的设立，以及从非军事区内清除危险物。负责汉江口地区的联合观察小组第一组和第二组，在军事停战委员会制定有关管理汉江口航运的各项规定后即出发工作。
    中立国监察委员会将在六日上午开会，邀请军事停战委员会朝中方面和联合国军方面的首席委员出席，澄清有关派赴双方后方口岸各中立国视察小组的交通、通讯和人员安全等问题，以便最后确定各小组的出发日期。
    中立国监察委员会的二十个中立国视察小组的组员，五日下午五时已在板门店会晤。派赴双方后方口岸的十个小组，每组由四个中立国各指派军官二名，共八名军官组成。各组在出发日期确定后，将即刻往各指定口岸执行任务，以监督停止自朝鲜境外进入增援的军事人员、作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药。其他十个机动的中立国视察小组，将留在总部候命。各小组的徽记已在中立国监察委员会四日的会议上予以确定。
    战俘遣返委员会近几天来举行了八次会议，在四日交换“遣返战俘行政细节的谅解”的文本后，完成了从今天开始的战俘遣返的准备工作。联合红十字会小组的北组及南组，已按照双方协议从板门店出发，分头前往访问双方管理下的战俘营，慰问战俘及分发馈赠品，并在途中为战俘提供服务。北组的一个分组留在开城，南组的一个分组留在汶山工作，中组于五日在板门店双方交接地区开始了工作，在板门店的协调组将就北、中、南三组的工作随时进行磋商。
