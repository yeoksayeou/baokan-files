    Protocol on the Cessation of Collection of German Reparations and Other Measures to Reduce the Financial and Economic Obligations Borne by the German Democratic Republic as a Result of the War
    In view of the fact that Germany has fulfilled a considerable part of the financial and economic obligations to the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France as a result of the war; considering it necessary to improve the economic situation of Germany; considering that the Soviet Government, in its note of August 15, suggested that the governments of the United States, Great Britain, and France greatly reduce Germany's financial and economic obligations to the four countries as a result of the war, and that the adoption of these suggestions by the above-mentioned Western countries would guarantee the implementation of these measures for the whole of Germany; and considering that, regardless of the decisions taken by the governments of the United States, Great Britain, and France on this issue, the implementation of these suggestions for the German Democratic Republic will provide significant help to the German people not only in economic terms but also in creating the necessary conditions for restoring the unity of Germany as a peace-loving and democratic country and accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty;—the Governments of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, after discussion, have reached an agreement to implement the following measures:
    (1) The Soviet Government, having reached an agreement with the Government of the Polish People's Republic (regarding the portion of reparations it enjoys), has decided to completely cease collecting reparations from the German Democratic Republic from January 1, 1954, whether in the form of commodity supplies or in any other way.
    Therefore, the German Democratic Republic is relieved of the obligation to pay the remaining portion of reparations from January 1, 1954. According to the Soviet Government's statement of May 15, 1950, on reducing Germany's reparations to the Soviet Union, this reparation amounts to 2,537 million US dollars based on 1938 world prices.
    (2) The Soviet Government will, from January 1, 1954, transfer without compensation a total of thirty-three machine-building, chemical, metallurgical, and other enterprises located in Germany to the German Democratic Republic. These enterprises were previously received by the Soviet Union as reparations and are worth a total of 2.7 billion marks.
    A Soviet-German mixed commission will be established to handle the transfer procedures.
    At the same time, the Soviet Government releases the German Democratic Republic from debts totaling 430 million marks, which were incurred as a result of the Soviet Government's transfer of sixty-six Soviet industrial enterprises located in Germany to the Government of the German Democratic Republic in 1952.
    (3) The Soviet Government will reduce the expenses borne by the German Democratic Republic for the stationing of Soviet troops on the territory of the German Democratic Republic, stipulating that this expense shall not exceed 5 percent of the German Democratic Republic's national budget revenue annually, and in no case should it exceed the total amount of occupation fees in 1949.
    Based on this, the German Democratic Republic's expenses for maintaining the Soviet troops stationed in Germany in 1954 will be 1.6 billion marks, while in 1953 this expense was 1.95 billion marks, and in 1949 it was 2.182 billion marks.
    (4) The Soviet Government declares that it completely relieves the German Democratic Republic of the debt for occupation fees (foreign currency) accumulated since 1945. In this regard, the Soviet Government also declares that Germany is exempt from repaying post-war national debt to the Soviet Union.
    Done in Moscow on August 22, 1953, in two copies, each in Russian and German, both texts being equally authentic.

    关于停止收取德国赔偿费和关于减轻德意志民主共和国由于战争的后果而担负的财政与经济义务之其他措施的议定书
    鉴于德国已经向苏联、美国、英国和法国履行了颇大部分的由于战争的后果而担负的财政和经济义务；考虑到有必要改善德国的经济状况；考虑到苏联政府在八月十五日的照会中建议美国、英国和法国三国政府大大减少德国由于战争的后果而对四国担负的财政和经济义务，而上述西方国家政府采纳这些建议，就会保证对整个德国实行这些措施；同时考虑到，不管美国、英国和法国三国政府对这一问题采取什么决定，对德意志民主共和国实行这些建议，就会不仅在经济方面、而且在创造必要条件、恢复作为爱好和平与民主的国家的德国的统一与加速缔结对德和约方面，给予德国人民以重大的帮助；——苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府经过讨论后，达成了协议，决定实行下列措施：
    （一）苏联政府经与波兰人民共和国政府（关于赔偿费中它所享有的一部分）取得协议，决定从一九五四年一月一日起，完全停止自德意志民主共和国收取赔偿费，无论是以商品供应的方式还是以任何其他方式。
    因此，德意志民主共和国自一九五四年一月一日起，就解除了偿付赔偿费剩余部分的义务，按照苏联政府一九五○年五月十五日关于减少德国对苏联赔偿费的声明，这项赔偿费按一九三八年世界价格计算，共为二十五亿三千七百万美元。
    （二）苏联政府自一九五四年一月一日起，无代价地将位于德国的机器制造、化学、冶金和其他企业共三十三个移交给德意志民主共和国，这些企业是过去由苏联接受作为赔偿的，总价值是二十七亿马克。
    为了办理移交的手续，将成立一个苏德混合委员会。
    同时，苏联政府解除德意志民主共和国的总数达四亿三千万马克的债务，这笔债务是由于一九五二年苏联政府把位于德国的六十六个苏联工业企业转交给德意志民主共和国政府而成立的。
    （三）苏联政府将减少德意志民主共和国由于苏联在德意志民主共和国的领土上驻扎军队而承担的费用，规定这笔费用每年不超过德意志民主共和国国家预算收入的百分之五，无论如何不应超过一九四九年占领费的总数。
    根据这一点，德意志民主共和国一九五四年维持驻扎在德国的苏联军队的费用将是十六亿马克，而一九五三年这笔费用是十九亿五千万马克，一九四九年是二十一亿八千二百万马克。
    （四）苏联政府声明，它完全解除德意志民主共和国偿付自一九四五年以后积欠的占领费（外国货币）的债务。在这一方面，苏联政府还要声明，德国免向苏联偿付战后国债。
    一九五三年八月二十二日订于莫斯科，共两份，每份均用俄文和德文缮就，两种文字的条文均有同等效力。
