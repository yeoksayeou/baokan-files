Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 11th: The fact that representatives of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Chinese Red Cross Society participating in the joint Red Cross team were subjected to various unreasonable restrictions when visiting our captured personnel in South Korea has been confirmed by our captured personnel who have returned in recent days.

　　Xu Gongdu, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who returned on August 8, represented our captured personnel in Busan on August 6 to meet with representatives of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross at the US military command. At that time, a US Colonel wearing a pistol was supervising, and announced that the talks between the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives and the prisoners of war had to be approved by them. During the conversation, the US Colonel often stopped them from speaking, and even asked the POW representative to leave. Later, the US Colonel even stated that "the joint Red Cross team's limited working hours per day have now been reached," and forcibly ended the visit. Wang Wentao, a returned captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, spoke about two other situations: At 10:00 am on August 4, after our Red Cross personnel arrived at Munsan, the US military police did not allow our Red Cross personnel to meet with our captured personnel. Only after negotiation were they allowed to send a representative to meet them. The other captured personnel were still locked in barbed wire, only able to watch our Red Cross personnel from afar, and listen to our Red Cross personnel talking to them through loudspeakers. At 4:00 pm on August 8, thirty captured soldiers of the Korean People's Army who were about to be repatriated were locked in a barbed wire enclosure in Yeongdeungpo. At that time, a group of US military police, military doctors, and a Rhee Syngman military policeman, accompanied by several people wearing Red Cross badges from the other side, came to distribute canned food, pork, and cigarettes, saying that they were issued by the Korean-Chinese Red Cross, while distributing them, they threatened that these things were poisonous. Half an hour later, representatives of our Red Cross arrived at the POW camp, but they were not allowed to meet with our captured personnel, and could only hand over letters of condolence to our captured personnel from outside the barbed wire.

　　In contrast, the joint Red Cross team has full freedom of activity in our area. The opposing representatives of the joint Red Cross team stationed in the Kaesong subgroup have carefully observed the various facilities of our transit camp for repatriating prisoners of war in recent days, held four symposiums with non-Korean and Korean prisoners of war who are about to be repatriated, and conducted a free visit to 300 non-Korean prisoners of war for two hours and twenty minutes on the afternoon of the 6th. About a quarter of the prisoners of war in the transit camp spoke with them. Australian Red Cross representative Morrison also gave a speech to more than 470 prisoners of war on the morning of the 9th.

### 美方限制我方红十字会人员在南朝鲜的活动

    美方限制我方红十字会人员在南朝鲜的活动
    【新华社开城十一日电】参加联合红十字会小组工作的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国红十字会的代表和中华人民共和国红十字会的代表，在南朝鲜访问我方被俘人员时受到种种无理限制，这一事实已由连日归来的我方被俘人员所证实。
    八月八日归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员续公度，八月六日在釜山时曾代表我方被俘人员到美军司令部里去会见朝中红十字会的代表。当时有一个佩带手枪的美军上校在监督，宣布朝中红十字会代表对战俘的谈话要经过他们的允许。在谈话中，这个美军上校经常制止他们发言，甚至要战俘代表出去。后来，美军上校竟声言“现在联合红十字会小组每天被限定的工作时间已经到了”，强制结束了这次访问。归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员王文涛谈到另外两次的情形：八月四日上午十时，我方红十字会人员到达汶山后，美方宪兵不让我方红十字会人员和我方被俘人员见面，经过交涉，才准许我方被俘人员派一个代表去见。其他被俘人员仍被关在铁丝网内，只能远远地望着我方红十字会人员，倾听我方红十字会人员通过扩音器和他们谈话。八日下午四时，即将被遣返的三十个朝鲜人民军被俘人员关在永登浦的一座铁丝网围场内，当时有一群美方宪兵、军医和一个李承晚宪兵，陪着几个对方的配戴红十字会记号的人前来分发罐头、猪肉和香烟，说是朝中方面红十字会发的，一面分发一面恐吓说这些东西有毒。半小时后，我方红十字会代表到达战俘营，他们却不能和我方被俘人员会面，只能从铁丝网外把慰问信交给我方被俘人员。
    与此相反，联合红十字会小组在我方地区却有着充分的活动自由。联合红十字会小组驻开城分组的对方代表几天来曾仔细观察了我方遣送战俘的转运营的各种设备，与即将遣返的非朝鲜籍和朝鲜籍战俘举行了四次座谈会，并于六日下午向三百名非朝鲜籍战俘进行了两小时二十分钟的自由访问，转运营中约有四分之一的战俘和他们谈了话。澳大利亚红十字会代表摩里逊在九日上午还对四百七十多名战俘发表了演说。
