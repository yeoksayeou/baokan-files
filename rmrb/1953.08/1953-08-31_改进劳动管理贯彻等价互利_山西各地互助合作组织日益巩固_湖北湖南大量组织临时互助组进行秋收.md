    Improve Labor Management, Implement Equal Value Exchange and Mutual Benefit
    Mutual Aid and Cooperation Organizations Increasingly Consolidated in Various Parts of Shanxi
    Large Numbers of Temporary Mutual Aid Groups Organized for Autumn Harvest in Hubei and Hunan
    The agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement in Shanxi Province, after correcting the tendency of blind and rash advance, is now progressing steadily and actively. More than 2,300 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 60,000 permanent mutual aid groups are becoming increasingly consolidated; seasonal and permanent mutual aid groups have also seen new development. During the patriotic increase production movement in the spring and summer seasons, mutual aid and cooperation organizations fully demonstrated their great superiority. This summer, various places have accepted the lessons from the past when mutual aid groups were prone to "dissolving in the summer." Based on the new situation of abundant rain, dense seedlings, abundant weeds, and insufficient labor, they have tightly grasped the resolution of labor management and equal value exchange and mutual benefit issues in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, improving labor efficiency, and further consolidating and improving mutual aid and cooperation organizations.
    In terms of agricultural production cooperatives, the advanced experience of the seasonal contracting system of the Guo Yu'en agricultural production cooperative was first widely promoted, changing the temporary assignment system of "allocating according to the work done." Of the more than 2,300 agricultural production cooperatives in the province, aside from a few that implemented the system of contracting for both work and output, about half or more have implemented short-term or seasonal contracting systems. For example, in the 110 cooperatives in Ping Shun County, Changzhi area, only nine cooperatives used a temporary assignment system; in the 28 cooperatives in Ping Ding County, Yuci area, 24 cooperatives implemented the contracting system; in the eight cooperatives in Yang Qu County, Xin County area, only one cooperative temporarily assigned work; in the 13 cooperatives in Hun Yuan County, Yanbei area, nine cooperatives implemented short-term contracting during summer weeding. Cooperatives that implemented the contracting system generally increased their weeding efficiency by one-sixth to one-fifth. Secondly, Yangcheng, Huguan, Xiangyuan, Wuzhai, Shenchi and other counties, also paid attention to helping agricultural production cooperatives improve their financial management, ensuring reasonable expenditures, clear accounts, and supervising and promoting production.
    In terms of mutual aid groups, the contradiction of doing work in different sequences was prominently resolved. Many mutual aid groups adopted methods such as unified arrangement of work, sequencing according to work needs, land evaluation of labor, and labor in small groups, with diligent rotations, changing the past practices of temporary allocation of work, mechanical rotation by household, and excessive emphasis on collective work. Secondly, various places flexibly promoted methods of recording work such as fixed scoring with live evaluation, contracting by piece, and fixed scoring based on seasonal work, changing the unreasonable phenomenon of "labor for labor, old men get full scores" in mutual aid groups.
    Due to the above series of improvements, general agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups were able to complete their production plans on time during the busy summer production season, and many cooperatives and groups, in addition to completing their own work early, also helped individual farmers with weeding and wheat harvesting in exchange for equivalent value. In this way, the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation organizations was greatly demonstrated, providing the most practical and effective education to farmers on organizing, and guiding about 70,000 farmers in the province to newly join mutual aid groups. Taking Guoxian County, where the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation was weak, as an example, 198 temporary groups were developed during the summer weeding, and 68 of the original seasonal groups were promoted to permanent groups. The proportion of farmers organized in the county increased from 26.6 percent in the spring to 30.5 percent.
    However, since the beginning of summer, a few areas have relaxed their leadership over mutual aid groups, resulting in unresolved contradictions in some mutual aid groups regarding the sequence of work and equal value exchange and mutual benefit, leading to disintegration and collapse. A few backward areas have consistently had right-leaning spontaneous tendencies, which have not been criticized and corrected, and mutual aid and cooperation organizations have basically not developed. Since July, this has aroused the serious attention of the leaders of various areas and counties. For example, 23 counties including Shuoxian, Pianguan, Ningwu, Dingxiang, Qixian, Hongdong, and Xinjiang have successively convened meetings of the main responsible cadres of the county and districts, or meetings of mutual aid and cooperation representatives, to review and criticize the phenomenon of leadership drift, further implement the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policy, and discuss and determine the principles and methods for actively rectifying mutual aid groups. Many counties have also identified key townships (villages) and sent cadres down to create experience.
    Xinhua News Agency: Wuhan, August 30th. In the intense autumn harvest work, many areas in Hubei and Hunan provinces are paying attention to organizing the vast number of farmers to participate in temporary labor exchange and mutual assistance to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor, livestock, and farm implements. Before the autumn harvest, in areas such as Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Enshi, Yichang, and Xiangyang in Hubei Province, and in some districts and townships in counties such as Xiangtan and Hanshou in Hunan Province, representative meetings for autumn harvest mutual aid, symposiums for mutual aid group leaders, and symposiums for veteran farmers were generally convened at the district and township levels. These meetings studied the ideological concerns of the masses regarding the organization of mutual aid groups, criticized the compulsory and commanding practices of the previous year, repeatedly explained the voluntary and mutually beneficial policies in mutual aid and cooperation, and, based on this year's heavy rains and the extremely urgent autumn harvest situation, studied the issue of flexible work scheduling, determined harvest plans according to the order of crop maturity, and discussed and resolved specific issues in mutual aid. The farmers who participated in the representative meetings and symposiums in various places were very satisfied, and they expressed their assurances that they would take the lead in organizing temporary labor exchange and mutual assistance. According to preliminary statistics from Echeng County, Hubei Province, 687 temporary labor exchange and mutual assistance groups have been organized in the past few days of the autumn harvest. More than 80 percent of the farmers in Xinyao Township in the fourth district have participated in temporary labor exchange and mutual assistance. At present, various places are continuing to organize large numbers of temporary labor exchange and mutual assistance groups to ensure the victorious completion of the autumn harvest and autumn planting.

    改进劳动管理贯彻等价互利
    山西各地互助合作组织日益巩固
    湖北湖南大量组织临时互助组进行秋收
    山西全省农业生产互助合作运动，在纠正盲目冒进偏向后，目前正在稳步而积极地前进，二千三百多个农业生产合作社和六万多个常年互助组，正日益走向巩固；季节性的和常年互助组也有新的发展。在春夏两季的爱国增产运动中，互助合作组织充分显示出极大的优越性。今年夏季各地接受往年互助组容易“夏散”的教训，根据雨多、苗稠、草大而劳力不足的新情况，紧紧抓住解决了农业生产合作社和互助组中劳动管理和等价互利问题，提高劳动效率，进一步巩固和提高了互助合作组织。
    在农业生产合作社方面，首先普遍地推广了郭玉恩农业生产合作社季节包工制的先进经验，改变“随做活随分配”的临时拨派制。全省两千三百多个农业生产合作社，除少数社实行了包工包产制以外，约有半数以上社推行了短期或季节性的包工制。如长治专区平顺县一百一十个社，只有九个社是临时拨派制；榆次专区平定县二十八个社，二十四个社都实行了包工制；忻县专区阳曲县八个社，只一个社是临时分配营生；雁北专区浑源县十三个社，夏锄中九个社实行了短期包工。凡实行了包工制的社，锄苗效率一般提高六分之一到五分之一。其次，阳城、壶关、襄垣、五寨、神池等县，并注意帮助农业生产合作社改进财务管理，保证合理开支，账目清楚，监督和推动生产。
    在互助组方面，首先突出地解决了做活先后的矛盾问题。不少互助组采用了统一安排营生、按营生需要排定次序、土地评工以及分小组劳动、勤轮流等办法，改变了过去临时拨工派工、机械按户轮流和过分强调集体干活的做法。其次，各地灵活地推行了死分活评、按件包工、按季按活评死分等记工办法，改变了互助组中“工顶工，老十分”的不合理现象。
    由于以上一系列的改进，一般农业生产合作社、互助组在繁忙的夏季生产中，都能按期完成生产计划，而且不少社、组除提早完成自己的活外，还用等价办法帮助单干农民锄苗、割麦。这样，便大大显示了互助合作组织的优越性，对农民作了最实际最有效的组织起来的教育，引导全省约有七万多农户新参加了互助组。以互助合作基础薄弱的崞县为例，夏锄中发展了临时组一百九十八个，原有的季节组有六十八个提高为常年组，全县组织起来的农户比例，由春季百分之二十六点六，上升到百分之三十点五。
    但入夏以来也有少数地区放松了对互助组的领导，致使部分互助组做活先后的矛盾和等价互利等问题得不到解决，以至涣散和垮台。个别落后地区，则是一贯存在着右倾自流倾向，没有受到批判和纠正，互助合作组织基本上没有发展。七月份以来，已引起各地专、县领导上的严重注意，如朔县、偏关、宁武、定襄、祁县、洪洞、新绛等二十三县，都先后召开县、区主要负责干部会议，或互助合作代表会议，检查和批判了领导自流现象，进一步贯彻了党的互助合作政策，讨论和确定了积极整顿互助组的方针和办法。许多县并确定了重点乡
    （村），派干部下去创造经验。
    又讯：湖北湖南两省不少地区在紧张的秋收工作中，注意组织广大农民参加临时换工互助，解决劳力、畜力和农具不足的困难。湖北省黄冈、孝感、荆州、恩施、宜昌、襄阳等专区和湖南省湘潭、汉寿等县的部分区乡，在秋收以前，就以区、乡为单位普遍召开了秋收互助代表会、互助组长座谈会、老农座谈会，研究群众对组织互助组的思想顾虑，批判了去年强迫命令的作法，反复交代了互助合作中的自愿互利政策，并根据今年雨多，秋收十分紧迫的情况，研究了灵活排工的问题，按照庄稼先熟后熟，定出收割计划，和讨论解决了互助中的具体问题以后，各地参加代表会和座谈会的农民都很满意，并纷纷提出保证，回去一定带头组织好临时换工互助。据湖北省鄂城县的初步统计，在几天秋收中，已组织了六百八十七个临时换工互助组。四区新窑乡百分之八十以上的农户，参加了临时换工互助。目前，各地正继续大量组织临时换工互助组，以保证秋收秋种的胜利完成。
