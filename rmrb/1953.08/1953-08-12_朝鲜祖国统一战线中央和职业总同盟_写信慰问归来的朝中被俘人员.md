Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th: The newspapers here published on the 9th the letters of condolence written on August 5th by the Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front to the returning Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war.

The letter of condolence to the Korean People's Army prisoners of war stated: The Central Committee of the Fatherland United Democratic Front feels infinitely joyful at your return to the warm embrace of your beloved homeland and people, and extends warm congratulations to you.

You fought in the dark and murderous living hell of the U.S. imperialist prisoner-of-war camps, and never succumbed to the enemy's bestial persecution and suppression, but steadfastly expressed your loyalty to the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and the leader. The Korean people all praise your fighting spirit, and they have never ceased their struggle to rescue you from death.

The Korean people, resolutely united around the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government led by Marshal Kim Il-sung, with the active assistance of the peace-loving people of the world, headed by the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, dealt a decisive blow to the U.S. imperialist aggressors and the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang who attempted to conquer our country by force. Therefore, you finally escaped the death camps of the prisoners of war and returned to the embrace of the motherland. You have returned to the land of freedom and democracy—the northern half of the Republic, and a broad and bright future full of hope is unfolding before you.

Today, all the Korean people are responding to Marshal Kim Il-sung's call of "Everything for strengthening the democratic base and restoring and developing the postwar people's economy," rising up in unison to complete the great cause of peacefully unifying our motherland and restoring and building the postwar national economy.

We warmly congratulate you on participating in the great cause of peacefully building the motherland. We expect and firmly believe that you will fully demonstrate your loyalty to the motherland, the people, and the leader with new determination and fighting spirit in this glorious struggle.

The letter of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war stated: The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front extends a warm welcome and congratulations to you who have escaped the enemy's dark prisoner-of-war camps and will return to the warm embrace of your motherland.

Under the banner of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, you bravely fought to help the Korean people. In the enemy's prisoner-of-war camps, you also upheld your love for the motherland and the people, and defended the honor of lofty internationalist soldiers, regardless of all the enemy's persecution and threats.

When the Korean and Chinese peoples were waging a tenacious and unyielding struggle for the honor and freedom of the two peoples, they never forgot you, and they have been steadfastly fighting to bring you happy and free days as soon as possible. Today, thanks to the heroic struggle of the Korean and Chinese peoples and the support and solidarity of the world peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, the Korean armistice has been achieved. Therefore, you have gained freedom and returned to the warm embrace of the people and the motherland.

The Korean people will never forget the glorious achievements of the heroic commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who aided the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War with their blood.

The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front is confident that you will achieve brilliant success in participating in the construction of the great People's China, and warmly wishes you victory and a glorious future.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th: The Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea wrote letters of condolence on the 8th to the returning Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war.

The letter to the Korean People's Army prisoners of war stated: The Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, on behalf of all workers, technicians, and staff, extends warm congratulations and welcomes you on your return to the motherland from the enemy's prisoner-of-war camps. Today, the combat tasks before us are to rapidly restore and develop the people's economy that has been destroyed by the war, to further strengthen our country's national defense capabilities, to consolidate the democratic base maintained by our people, and to complete the historic and great cause of peacefully unifying the motherland. The Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea sincerely hopes that you will respond to the call of our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung to "Everything for strengthening the democratic base and restoring and developing the postwar people's economy," unite around the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, and participate in the glorious struggle to restore and build the postwar motherland.

The letter to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war stated: The Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, on behalf of all workers, technicians, and staff, extends warm congratulations to you who have broken free from the shackles of the enemy's prisoner-of-war camps and returned to the warm embrace of your motherland. We, along with all the Korean people, have never forgotten that you aided us with your blood. We contributed all our strength to strive for the final victory of our common struggle and to rescue you. Today, the heroic Korean and Chinese peoples have achieved a historic victory. All the Korean workers, technicians, and staff are sincerely pleased that you have been able to return to your lovely hometowns and wish you a future full of brightness and hope. We wish you success in building achievements in the glorious cause of developing your own country.
