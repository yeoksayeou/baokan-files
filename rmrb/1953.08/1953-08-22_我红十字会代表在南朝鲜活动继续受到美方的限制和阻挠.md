Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 21st: The activities of the Joint Red Cross Team's Korean-Chinese representatives in South Korea continue to be restricted and obstructed.

    Major General McGarr, Commander of the U.S. military POW camp, issued an order to all U.S. military POW camps stating: "Joint Red Cross Teams are not allowed to enter any POW camp areas," and "No personnel from the Joint Red Cross Team are allowed to enter any place where they might approach POWs." Therefore, the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives visiting the Koje Island POW camp have only been allowed to observe our captured personnel from a distance of one hundred meters away from the barbed wire. The U.S. military POW camp management authorities superficially claimed that visits to the dormitories, kitchens, and other facilities in the POW camp would be allowed, but only in the absence of POWs.

    Due to unreasonable inspections by the U.S. military authorities, the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives in the Yeongdeungpo group have been unable to deliver messages of condolence to our captured personnel since August 6th. On the 11th, the U.S. military authorities further prohibited the distribution of letters of consolation. The Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives' request to hold a forum with our captured personnel was also unreasonably rejected by the U.S. side. Consequently, they have been forced to cease their work since the 12th.

    我红十字会代表在南朝鲜活动继续受到美方的限制和阻挠
    【新华社开城二十一日电】联合红十字会小组朝中代表在南朝鲜的活动继续受到限制和阻挠。
    美军战俘营司令部长官麦克加尔少将向所有美军战俘营发布命令说：“联合红十字会小组不得进入任何战俘营场”，“联合红十字会小组任何人员不得进入可能与战俘接近的地方”。因此在巨济岛战俘营访问的朝中红十字会代表一直只被允许在离铁丝网一百公尺以外的地方观看我方被俘人员。美军战俘营管理当局虽然在表面上说是可以参观战俘营中的宿舍、伙房及其他设备，但是这要在没有战俘在场的情况下才被允许。
    永登浦分组朝中红十字会代表由于美军当局的无理检查，从八月六日以后就未能向我方被俘人员致慰问词。到了十一日，美军当局又禁止分发慰问信。朝中红十字会代表要求与我方被俘人员举行座谈会，也遭受美方的无理拒绝。因此他们从十二日起就被迫停止了工作。
