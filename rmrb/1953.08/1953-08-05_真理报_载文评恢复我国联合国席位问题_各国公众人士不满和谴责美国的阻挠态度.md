Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. TASS News Agency, Moscow, August 3rd: "Pravda" published an article by Prischevsky, commenting on the demand by the broad public in almost all countries to restore China's seat in the United Nations. Prischevsky said: To be fair, an organization founded to ensure peace and security has no right to ignore the rights of a country with 500 million people simply because the United States government, one of the organization's sixty member states, dislikes the political and social system established by the Chinese people.

At every session of the UN General Assembly, and in almost every UN body, there are constant and resolute demands in one form or another for the restoration of the position in the United Nations that the Chinese people rightfully deserve. This is by no means accidental. Up until now, it is only due to pressure from the United States that most delegations have had to vote against handing over the seat illegally occupied by the Kuomintang puppets to the legitimate representatives of China, in violation of the vital interests of their countries.

Prischevsky said that the United States' aggression in the Korean War made it easier for the rulers of the United States to force their allies to accept their opinions and refuse to restore China's rights in the United Nations. He pointed out that the statement made by Dulles at a press conference in Washington on July 28 shows that the US government intends to continue to disregard the opinions of its partners in the future. However, the facts show that this policy has begun to lose its effectiveness with the United States' partners in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. Prischevsky said that it was no coincidence that many foreign newspapers were striving to hand over China's seat in the United Nations to China's legitimate representatives the day after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. These newspapers correctly pointed out that it is impossible to sincerely talk about resolving all outstanding issues in the Far East and easing the international situation while a country like the People's Republic of China is still being discriminated against.

Prischevsky pointed out that Dulles' threat to use the veto to obstruct China's admission to the United Nations has aroused dissatisfaction and been met with outspoken condemnation in some countries. In Britain and France, the calls for the restoration of China's legitimate status in the United Nations are growing louder. The newspapers of these two countries emphasize that no Far Eastern problem can be solved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. Most Eastern newspapers are calling for the immediate restoration of China's seat in the United Nations. In this regard, Indian newspapers are unanimous. They rightly point out that the participation of China's legitimate representatives in the United Nations will greatly accelerate the resolution of all pressing Far Eastern issues and ease tensions throughout the world. Official spokesmen and newspapers in Indonesia and other Asian countries are also in favor of restoring the rights of the Chinese people in the United Nations.

Prischevsky continued, in addition, there are also many sober voices in the United States itself calling for a "realistic attitude" towards the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Chinese people in the United Nations. But the attitude of the American rulers on this issue has a very definite purpose. This attitude, as the American newspapers frankly admit, is aimed at obstructing the establishment of peace in the Far East and obstructing the satisfactory resolution of Far Eastern disputes. However, this attitude is completely contrary to the opinions of the broad public in various countries who favor easing international tensions.

    “真理报”载文评恢复我国联合国席位问题
    各国公众人士不满和谴责美国的阻挠态度
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：“真理报”发表普利歇夫斯基的文章，评论几乎一切国家的广大公众人士要求恢复中国在联合国的席位。普利歇夫斯基说：公正地说，一个成立来确保和平与安全的组织没有权利仅仅因为作为这个组织的六十个会员国家之一的美国政府不喜欢中国人民建立起来的政治与社会制度，就无视这个有着五亿人口的国家的权利。
    在每届联合国大会上，在几乎每一个联合国机构中，都不断有人以这种或那种形式坚决要求恢复中国人民在联合国中理应得到的地位，这决不是偶然的现象。一直到现在，仅仅由于美国的压力，大多数代表团才不得不违反他们国家的切身利益，投票反对把现在为国民党傀儡非法窃据的座位交给中国的合法代表。
    普利歇夫斯基说，美国侵略朝鲜战争使得美国的统治者更容易强使他们的盟国接受他们的意见，拒绝恢复中国在联合国的权利。他指出，从杜勒斯七月二十八日在华盛顿的记者招待会上发表的声明可以看出：美国政府打算在将来对它的伙伴的意见仍然置之不理。然而，事实说明，这个政策对美国在北大西洋侵略集团中的伙伴已开始失去效用了。普利歇夫斯基说，就在朝鲜停战协定签字以后的第二天，许多外国报纸竭力要求把中国在联合国的席位交给中国合法代表，这不是偶然的。这些报纸正确地指出，在中华人民共和国这样的国家还受到歧视的时候，要真诚地说到来解决所有悬而未决的远东问题以及缓和国际局势是不可能的。
    普利歇夫斯基指出，杜勒斯扬言要使用否决权阻挠接纳中国加入联合国，他这种威胁已在一些国家中引起了不满，并受到了直率的谴责。在英国和法国，要求恢复中国在联合国的合法地位的呼声越来越响亮了。这两个国家的报纸强调说，没有中华人民共和国参加，什么远东问题也解决不了。大多数东方报纸都要求立即恢复中国在联合国的席位。在这方面，印度报纸的意见是一致的。它们正确地指出，中国合法代表参加联合国将大大加速所有迫切的远东问题的解决，并使全世界的紧张局势得到缓和。印度尼西亚和其他亚洲国家的官方发言人和报纸同样赞成恢复中国人民在联合国的权利。
    普利歇夫斯基继续说，此外，在美国本国，也有不少冷静的呼声，要求对恢复中国人民在联合国的合法权利问题采取“现实态度”。但是美国统治者在这个问题上的态度有着一个十分确定的目的。这种态度，正如美国报纸所坦率地承认的，目的是阻挠建立远东和平，并阻挠圆满地解决远东争执问题。然而，这种态度是完全不合乎赞成缓和国际紧张局势的各国广大公众人士的意见的。
