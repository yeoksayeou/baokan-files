    In order to implement the Central Committee's instructions on cadre theory education for 1953-1954 and to train instructors and tutors in the study of economic construction theory throughout the province, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an economic construction theory training class in late May of this year. The participants included 107 full-time theory instructors, 57 full-time tutors, 129 educational administrative cadres, and 101 cadres from economic and enterprise departments, totaling 394 people. The learning content was Chapters 9-12 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," with the insertion of special reports on Chinese issues and certain documents. The study lasted for 54 days.

    In terms of learning methods, the training class adopted a policy of equal emphasis on lectures and self-study. When studying each chapter, students were first asked to preview the chapter, then the instructor lectured, followed by close reading and discussion, and timely insertion of special reports and document study on China's economic construction issues. Finally, a summary of each chapter was made, and difficult questions were answered. This method can meet the requirements of combining theory with practice and is satisfactory to most students.

    After two months of study, the trainees have made significant gains, mainly reflected in:

    (1) Enriched theoretical knowledge of economic construction, preliminarily understood the theory of the transition period and the basic experience of the Soviet Union's implementation of the New Economic Policy from the Soviet construction process, thereby enhancing the understanding of the Party's economic construction line and policies.

    Before the study, many people had quite poor knowledge of economic construction theory and Soviet construction experience. For example, some people believed that there was a ready-made socialist society after the October Revolution, some confused War Communism with the New Economic Policy, some equated War Communism with Communism, some believed that War Communism was wrong and the New Economic Policy was a correction... After the study, the above confused ideas were clarified. People recognized the necessity of the transition period and the essence of the New Economic Policy, the way to transform the small-commodity economy to transition to socialist large-scale production, the necessity of using capitalist economic components to build socialism under the dictatorship of the proletariat and the control of the economic lifeline, and the importance of commerce in consolidating the worker-peasant economic alliance and building the socialist economy. Based on these understandings, the understanding of the Party's line and policies was enhanced, and the profound significance of Chairman Mao's instruction on "The serious problem is to educate the peasants" and the basis and essence of the Party's policy towards private capitalism were further realized. The thought of wanting to eliminate capitalism quickly regardless of objective economic conditions and the bad style of coercing peasants were criticized. On the issue of commerce, the erroneous views of underestimating commerce, being unwilling to do commercial work, and not caring about the Party's commercial policies were corrected.

    (2) A more systematic and clear understanding of the principles of socialist industrialization was gained, thereby further appreciating the direction, policies, and significance of our country's large-scale economic construction, enhancing confidence in building the country, understanding the relationship between industrial construction and various aspects of work, and establishing a global perspective of serving industrial construction.

    Before the study, although everyone knew about industrialization, there were many incorrect understandings of industrialization. For example, some believed that industrialization meant "opening factories everywhere," "accumulating funds mainly relied on public grain," "increasing production and practicing economy was only to change the social atmosphere"... After the study, there was a clearer understanding of the important role of industrialization in transforming various sectors of the national economy, the methods of two kinds of industrialization under two social systems, the priority development of heavy industry, reliance on internal accumulation, and the relationship between industry and agriculture. The above-mentioned erroneous ideas were criticized. At the same time, combined with reports and discussions on Chinese issues, the tasks and conditions for achieving industrialization in our country were recognized, the outline and prospects of national industrialization were seen, confidence in construction was enhanced, the necessity of key construction, unified concentration and the idea that various works should serve national industrialization and heavy industry were clarified. Furthermore, some erroneous thoughts of departmentalism and decentralism that hindered unified concentration, as well as erroneous thoughts of belittling agriculture, local industry, handicrafts and other uneasiness with one's own job were examined, exposed and criticized. A global perspective was initially established, and the position and role of various works in large-scale economic construction were clearly recognized.

    (3) A clearer understanding of the significance of the Soviet Union's agricultural collectivization policy, the dual nature of the small-peasant economy, the development law and basic experience of the collectivization movement was gained, thereby further appreciating the basis and significance of the Party's policy of leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. The erroneous thoughts of blind rashness and laissez-faire in the transformation of the small-peasant economy were criticized.

    Before the study, many comrades knew that collectivization was good, but they did not know much about the specific process and experience of the Soviet Union's implementation of collectivization, and there were many erroneous thoughts. For example, some believed that "after the victory of the October Revolution, the rich peasants were eliminated, and there were no classes in the countryside," some believed that "with the political power in hand, all-round collectivization can be implemented by simply issuing orders," some believed that "all-round collectivization can be implemented without eliminating the rich peasants," some believed that "the proletariat controls the political power, and the small-peasant economy will naturally follow socialism." After the study, a more systematic understanding was gained of the role of the Soviet agricultural collectivization policy in thoroughly eliminating capitalism and building socialism, the dual nature of the small-peasant economy, the necessity of consolidating the alliance with the middle peasants, the process of collectivization, and the conditions for implementing all-round collectivization. At the same time, combined with the study of China's mutual aid and cooperation movement, the correctness of the policy of active leadership and steady progress was further appreciated, and persuasion and demonstration were the main methods of leading the small-peasant economy. Therefore, the blind rashness and laissez-faire tendencies of the mutual aid and cooperation movement were further criticized. This provides a powerful ideological and theoretical weapon for correctly leading the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    (4) A preliminary understanding of the basis for the Soviet Union's formulation of the new constitution, the basic characteristics of the new constitution, and the significance and role of the new constitution in encouraging the people to complete socialist construction was gained, thereby recognizing the correct relationship between our country's current implementation of universal suffrage, preparation for formulating a constitution, and large-scale construction, and criticizing the erroneous thoughts of belittling universal suffrage and democratic construction. Before the study, many people did not understand the constitution. After the study, there was a preliminary understanding of what a constitution is, the role of the constitution, and the superiority and significance of the Soviet Union's new constitution. Combined with the study of Chinese issues, it was recognized why universal suffrage was implemented, the significance of universal suffrage for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and strengthening the country's various constructions, and the superiority of the people's congress system was recognized. The erroneous views of belittling elections and opposing democratic elections to the Party's leadership were changed, and the understanding of democratic construction and the formulation of a constitution was enhanced, and a legal concept was initially established.

    (5) Through the study of the theory and experience of Soviet socialist construction, the greatness and wisdom of Lenin and Stalin were further appreciated, and the importance of learning from the Soviet Union and learning the theory of economic construction was even more felt, and the consciousness of studying theory and the confidence in carrying out theoretical education were enhanced.

    The training class over the past two months has gained the following experiences in guiding the study of economic construction theory for middle and primary level cadres:

    (1) Before the formal study, an enlightening report must be made to expound the basic arguments of the transition period and summarize the main contents of each chapter to prepare for the formal study. At the beginning of the school year, students were at a loss as to what to study and how to relate it to Chinese issues. Therefore, first, in the form of an introduction, briefly explain the historical stages of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), the basic theories of the transition period, and the basic process from the emergence of socialist economic components to the construction of socialism, as well as how to connect with China, and spend three days referring to "Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" for discussion. In this way, everyone understood the specific purpose, focus, and method of the study, increased the interest in learning, and created favorable conditions for formal study.

    (2) Implement the method of "less but精 (jing - refined/high quality)" and key learning throughout the entire teaching process: Since the students are generally new to studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and have to undertake the task of teaching and tutoring, there is a common phenomenon of being unable to chew, unable to grasp the key points, and being greedy for more at the beginning of the school year. For this reason, on the one hand, we criticized the idea of greed for more and repeatedly explained the principle of "less but jing," and on the other hand, we specifically helped the students to grasp the key points in the learning process. For example, before studying each chapter, clarify the established learning objectives and learning focus, explain the key issues in detail during lectures, and address the main issues when answering questions.

    (3) Emphasize learning the theory and experience of Soviet economic construction from the actual historical process, and for each important issue, the historical and theoretical basis must be recognized. In view of the fact that many people lack knowledge of the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) and international knowledge, therefore, while emphasizing "less but精 (jing - refined/high quality)," it is necessary to prevent the tendency of neglecting historical conditions and abstractly and emptily studying theory. For this reason, it is necessary to adhere to the basic ideas of Marxism-Leninism based on historical facts. That is to say, it is necessary to learn the theory of economic construction of Lenin and Stalin according to historical conditions, emphasize clarifying the historical environment, social and economic situation of a certain period, and understanding the problems facing the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) under the then environment and the construction tasks, policies and policies prescribed by Lenin and Stalin for such problems, as well as the role of this policy in guiding actual construction work. This can both enable students to recognize that Lenin's and Stalin's theories originate from practice and conform to the laws of social and economic development, and can also recognize the great power of this theory in guiding actual construction, especially in the study of combining Chinese issues, distinguishing the different situations of the two countries, distinguishing the general laws and the special laws, and correctly using Soviet experience.

    (4) Insert special reports on Chinese economic construction issues in the process of studying Soviet economic construction issues. Our study is divided into two steps. Each chapter first spends most of the time learning the theory and experience of Soviet economic construction in order to understand its spirit as an ideological weapon. At this time, the tendency to be eager to connect and reluctantly connect with Chinese issues should be prevented. Second, Party and government responsible cadres are invited to make special reports and study the designated relevant domestic documents. At this time, emphasis is placed on the specific analysis of the problems, avoiding the method of simplistic historical analogy, and emphasizing linking with reality, examining and criticizing their own policies and ideas. This can facilitate the grasp of ideological weapons, focus on studying problems, and avoid the tendency of blind connection.

    (5) It is necessary to prepare lessons carefully, strengthen collective research, continuously improve teaching, and answer questions responsibly and carefully. Experience has proven that the quality of lectures has a great impact on learning mood and learning effectiveness. Therefore, teachers must prepare lessons carefully, strengthen collective research work, and continuously improve teaching work. The special reports on Chinese issues should also follow the principle of "less but精 (jing - refined/high quality)," mainly to explain major policy issues. Questions raised in the study must be answered responsibly and carefully in a timely manner, and erroneous thinking methods and learning methods should be criticized when answering questions in order to improve students' ideological and theoretical level and ensure the implementation of the established teaching policy.

    (6) Guiding self-study carefully and holding well-prepared study discussions are important learning methods. Since the students' level is not high, and some lack self-study experience, it is necessary to strengthen guidance on self-study. Generally, the methods we adopt are: First, require to follow the study plan of each chapter, emphasizing clarifying the learning objectives before studying each chapter in order to read documents purposefully; second, implement remedial classes for those with low levels, and organize small mutual aid groups; third, proactively solve the difficulties raised by entering the group; fourth, summarize good learning methods through the summaries of each chapter.

    Since the training is short-term, long discussions are not allowed. We adopted the following methods in leading the study discussion: First, determine the unified discussion topic of the group according to the teaching purpose and the questions raised by the students. This facilitates the discussion to focus on the main issues, avoiding too much involvement and wasting time; second, the teacher should explain the purpose and content of the discussion topic to the study group leader so that they can be clear in mind when leading the discussion and guide the discussion to the main issues in a timely manner; third, emphasize preparing well before the discussion and writing an outline for each speech. Fourth, during the discussion, disputes should be carried out around the focus of the problem to prevent the phenomenon of not fighting each other and talking about different things.

    (7) It is necessary to organize reviews and write study experiences at the end of the study to consolidate and improve learning results. At the end of the study, a week was spent organizing reviews, issuing review questions according to the content that had been studied, so that students could review and integrate what they had learned. On this basis, everyone was required to write a study experience. This experience should be combined with their own work, write out the main gains and changes in their actual thoughts after learning, and circulate them to each other at the group meeting. This method is very helpful for sorting out thoughts, strengthening the digestion process, and clarifying the relationship between learning and their own work.

    中共河北省委举办经济建设理论教员训练班的收获和经验
    中共河北省委宣传部
    为了执行中央一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示，培养全省经济建设理论学习中的教员和辅导员，中共河北省委于今年五月下旬举办了经济建设理论训练班。参加学员计：专职理论教员一百零七人，专职辅导员五十七人，教育行政干部一百二十九人，经济企业部门的干部一百零一人，共三百九十四人。学习内容是“联共（布）党史”第九——十二章，学习中并插入结合中国问题的专题报告和一定文件。学习时间共五十四天。
    在学习方法上，训练班采取了讲课与自学并重的方针。在学习各章的时候，先让学员按章预习，再由教员讲述，然后进入精读和讨论，并适时插入中国经济建设问题的专题报告和文件学习，最后作出每章小结，解答疑难问题。这种方法能达到理论结合实际的要求，为一般学员所满意。
    经过两个月来的学习，参加受训的学员有较显著的收获，主要表现在：
    （一）丰富了经济建设的理论知识，从苏联建设的过程中初步领会了过渡时期的理论和苏联实行新经济政策的基本经验，从而提高了对党的经济建设的路线政策的认识。
    学习之前很多人对于经济建设理论和苏联建设经验的知识是相当贫乏的，如有些人认为十月革命后就是现成的社会主义社会，有的把战时共产主义与新经济政策混淆不清，有的把战时共产主义与共产主义混为一谈，有的认为战时共产主义是错误的，新经济政策是纠偏……。学习之后，澄清了以上胡涂思想，认识到过渡时期的必要性和新经济政策的实质，认识了改造小商品经济使之过渡到社会主义大生产的途径，认识了在无产阶级专政和掌握经济命脉条件下利用资本主义经济成份建设社会主义的必要性，认识了商业在巩固工农经济联盟和建设社会主义经济中的重要意义。在这些认识的基础上提高了对党的路线政策的认识，进一步体会到毛主席关于“严重的问题是教育农民”的指示的深刻意义和党对私人资本主义的政策的根据和实质。批判了不顾客观经济条件希图很快消灭资本主义的思想和对农民实行强迫命令的恶劣作风。在商业问题上纠正了轻视商业、不愿作商业工作及不关心党的商业政策的错误观点。
    （二）对社会主义国家工业化的原理有了比较系统明确的认识，从而对我国大规模经济建设的方针、方向和意义有了进一步的体会，提高了建设国家的信心，了解了工业建设与各方面工作的关系，树立了为工业建设服务的全局观点。
    学习之前大家虽然知道工业化，但对工业化却有许多不正确的了解。如有的认为工业化就是“处处开工厂”，“积累资金主要依靠公粮”，“增产节约只是为了改变社会风气”……。学习之后对工业化在改造国民经济各部门的重要作用，两种社会制度下两种工业化的方法，首先发展重工业，依靠内部积累，以及工业与农业的关系等问题，都有了比较明确的认识。批判了上述的错误思想观点。同时结合中国问题的报告和讨论，认识了我国实现工业化的任务和条件，看到了国家工业化的轮廓和远景，增强了建设信心，明确了重点建设、统一集中的必要和各种工作应为国家工业化服务、为重工业服务的思想，并检查、揭露和批判了一些妨碍统一集中的本位主义、分散主义的错误思想，轻视农业、轻视地方工业和手工业以及其他不安于本位工作的错误思想，初步树立了全局观点，明确认识了各种工作在大规模经济建设中的地位和作用。
    （三）对苏联实行农业集体化的政策的意义，小农经济的两重性，集体化运动的发展规律和基本经验，有了比较明确的认识，从而进一步体会了党领导互助合作运动的方针及自愿互利原则的根据和意义，批判了改造小农经济上的盲目冒进和放任自流的错误思想。
    学习之前很多同志虽然知道集体化好，但对苏联实行集体化的具体过程和经验是不大了解的，而且存在着许多错误思想。例如：有的认为“十月革命胜利后就消灭富农，乡村中就没有阶级了”，有的认为“政权在手，实行全盘集体化只要下命令就行”，有的认为“不消灭富农也可以全盘集体化”，有的认为“无产阶级掌握政权，小农经济自然跟着社会主义走”。在学习之后，对苏联农业集体化政策在彻底消灭资本主义建设社会主义中的作用，小农经济的两重性，巩固地联合中农的必要性，集体化的过程，实行全盘集体化的条件等等，都有了比较系统的了解。同时结合中国互助合作运动的学习，进一步体会到积极领导，稳步前进的方针的正确性，和说服示范是领导小农经济的主要方法，因而进一步批判了互助合作运动的盲目冒进思想和放任自流倾向。这就给正确领导农村互助合作运动以有力的思想理论武器。
    （四）对苏联制订新宪法的根据、新宪法的基本特点、新宪法在鼓舞人民完成社会主义建设中的意义和作用有了初步的认识，从而认识了目前我国实行普选，准备制定宪法和大规模建设的正确关系，批判了轻视普选工作，轻视民主建设的错误思想。学习之前，很多人对宪法是不了解的。经过学习，对什么是宪法，宪法的作用，苏联新宪法的优越性和意义有了初步的了解。结合中国问题的学习，认识了为什么实行普选，普选对巩固人民民主专政，加强国家各项建设的意义，认识了人民代表大会制度的优越性，改变了轻视选举以及把民主选举和党的领导对立的错误观点，提高了对民主建设、制定宪法的认识，初步树立了法治观点。
    （五）通过对苏联社会主义建设理论和经验的学习，进一步体会到列宁、斯大林的伟大英明，更加感到学习苏联，学习经济建设的理论的重要，提高了学习理论的自觉性和进行理论教育的信心。
    两个多月来的训练班在对中、初级水平的干部进行经济建设理论学习的指导上，获得了以下几项经验：
    （一）必须在正式学习以前作一次启发报告，阐述过渡时期基本论点，概括各章主要内容，以作为正式学习的准备。开学之初，学员对这次学习什么和怎样联系中国问题很茫然。因此，首先以引言的形式简要讲述联共（布）党的几个历史阶段、过渡时期的基本理论和从社会主义经济成份产生到建成社会主义的基本过程以及如何联系中国等问题，并以三天时间参阅“无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治”，加以讨论。这样一来，使大家明了了学习的具体目的、重点和方法，提高了学习兴趣，给正式学习创造了有利条件。
    （二）在全部教学过程中贯彻“少而精”和重点学习的方法：由于学员一般是初学“联共（布）党史”而又要担负教学辅导的任务，开学之初普遍存在啃不动、抓不住重点和贪多的现象。为此，我们一方面批判了贪多思想，反复讲明“少而精”的原则，一方面在学习过程中具体帮助学员掌握重点。如每章学习前明了既定的学习目的和学习重点，讲课中抓住重点问题详尽阐述，解答问题时讲主要问题等。
    （三）强调从历史实际过程中学习苏联经济建设的理论和经验，对于每一重要问题均必须认清其历史的和理论的根据。鉴于许多人缺乏联共（布）党历史知识和国际知识，因此在强调“少而精”的同时，必须防止忽视历史条件而抽象地、空洞地学习理论的偏向。为此必须坚持根据历史事实来说明马克思列宁主义的基本思想。这就是说必须根据历史条件来学习列宁、斯大林经济建设的理论，强调弄清一定时期的历史环境、社会经济情况，领会在当时环境条件下摆在联共（布）党面前的问题和列宁、斯大林针对这种问题所规定的建设任务、方针和政策，以及这种方针、政策在指导实际建设工作中的作用。这样作既可以使学员认识列宁、斯大林的理论来源于实践，符合于社会经济发展规律，又可以认识这种理论在指导实际建设中的伟大力量，特别便于在结合中国问题的学习中，区别两国不同情况，区别一般的规律和特殊的规律，正确地运用苏联经验。
    （四）在学习苏联经济建设问题的过程中适时插入中国经济建设问题的专题报告。我们的学习分两步走，每章首先以大部时间学习苏联经济建设的理论和经验，以便领会其精神，作为思想武器，这时应防止急于联系和勉强联系中国问题的偏向。其次是请党、政负责干部作专题报告，研究指定的本国有关文件，这时强调对问题的具体分析，避免简单化的历史类比的方法，强调联系实际，检查批判自己的政策思想。这样作能便于掌握思想武器，集中力量研究问题，避免盲目联系的偏向。
    （五）必须认真备课，加强集体研究，不断地改进教学并负责而慎重地解答问题。经验证明，讲课的好坏对学习情绪和学习效果影响很大，因此教员必须认真备课，加强集体研究工作，不断地改进教学工作。有关中国问题的专题报告亦应本“少而精”原则，主要是讲述重大政策问题。对于学习中提出的问题必须及时给予负责而慎重的解答，并在解答问题时批判错误的思想方法和学习方法，以提高学员的思想和理论水平，保证既定教学方针的贯彻。
    （六）认真地指导自修，开好有准备的学习讨论会是重要的学习方法。由于学员水平不高，有的并缺乏自学经验，因此必须加强对自修的指导。一般我们采取的办法是：第一、要求按照每章学习计划，强调学习各章之前明了学习目的，以便有目的地阅读文件；第二、对水平低的实行补课，并组织小型互助组；第三、深入小组主动解决所提出的疑难；第四、通过各章小结，表扬好的学习方法。
    由于训练是短期的，不允许过长时间的讨论，我们在领导学习讨论时采取以下办法：第一、依照教学目的和学员所提的问题确定小组统一的讨论题目。这样作便于使讨论围绕主要问题，避免牵连过广，浪费时间；第二、教员应把讨论题目的目的和内容要义向学习小组长作交代，使他们在领导讨论时心中有数，及时地把讨论引导到主要问题上去；第三、强调讨论前作好准备，每人写发言提纲。第四、讨论时应围绕问题焦点展开争论，防止互不交锋，各谈一套的现象。
    （七）必须在学习结束时，组织复习和写学习心得，以巩固和提高学习成果。学习结束时，曾以一周时间组织复习，按照已学过的内容发下复习题目，使学员把所学的东西，加以温习和贯通。在这种基础上要求每个人写一篇学习心得。这种心得应联系自己的工作，将自己学习后实际思想上的主要收获和变化写出来，并在小组会上互相传阅。这种方法对整理思想，加强消化过程，明确学习和自己工作的关系有很大好处。
