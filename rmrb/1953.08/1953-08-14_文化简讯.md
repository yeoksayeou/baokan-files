Xinjiang Province Organizes Folk Veterinarians to Prevent and Treat Livestock Diseases

The people's governments at all levels in the vast pastoral areas of Xinjiang Province have universally organized folk veterinarians this year to prevent and treat livestock diseases, reducing livestock mortality.

Xinjiang's pastoral areas are vast, and there is a shortage of veterinary cadres. In order to universally carry out livestock disease prevention and control work, during the spring grazing season this year, the Aksu, Kashgar, Ili, and Tacheng regions successively convened symposiums, representative meetings, and herder meetings for folk veterinarians. These meetings facilitated the exchange of experiences in preventing and treating livestock diseases, studied methods for preventing and treating various livestock diseases, and organized folk veterinarians to treat livestock for herders. Tuoli County organized 130 folk veterinarians from the entire county into 41 groups, sending them to pastures and grasslands to treat livestock. During the spring grazing season, they treated more than 2,000 head of livestock. The county also established folk veterinary teams in various districts and townships. In cooperation with folk veterinarians, the first and second districts of Wuqia County treated more than 6,500 head of livestock in March and April.
