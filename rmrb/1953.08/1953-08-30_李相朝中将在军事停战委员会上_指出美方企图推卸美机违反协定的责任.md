Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 28th: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 28th, the US Senior Member, Mr. Brien, attempted to create excuses to shirk responsibility for the continued intrusion of US military aircraft into our area for reconnaissance.

At the meeting, Brien refused to acknowledge nine of the twelve incidents raised by the Korean-Chinese side on the 8th, demanding that the US side pay attention to the US military aircraft violating the armistice agreement and intruding into our area for reconnaissance. Brien claimed that as long as the US side considered the materials regarding the US military aircraft violating the agreement insufficient, and did not specify the type of US aircraft violating the agreement, the US side would refuse to investigate any future US military aircraft violating the agreement. He also groundlessly stated that these military aircraft flying over the military demarcation line might be from the Korean-Chinese side.

General Li Xiangchao, the Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side, solemnly pointed out at the meeting that Brien's speech was merely an attempt to shirk the US side's responsibility for violating the armistice agreement. Incidents of US military aircraft violating the agreement continue to occur and increase, proving that the US side has not taken measures to stop such incidents. General Li Xiangchao stated that the Korean-Chinese side will not be bound by Brien's statement.

However, Brien had to admit today that a US military aircraft had violated the armistice agreement three times in a row on the 5th, intruding into the airspace of our demilitarized zone near Soning for reconnaissance. Up to now, the Korean-Chinese side has presented thirty-five incidents requiring the US side to pay attention to violations of the armistice agreement by US military aircraft, all listing the exact time, the number of US aircraft, and the latitude and longitude of the specific location of the intrusion. Moreover, the direction of flight and the area of activity of these aircraft all prove that they flew from the area under US control and then flew back to the US area. These irrefutable facts are absolutely undeniable by Brien. His speech shows that the US side is trying to create excuses in advance to shirk responsibility for the US side's deliberate continuation of violating the armistice agreement and dispatching military aircraft to intrude into our area for reconnaissance.

At the meeting on the 28th, General Li Xiangchao expressed deep concern about the difficulties encountered by the Neutral Nations Inspection Team personnel sent to the specific rear port in South Korea on the 20th within the US-controlled area. Prior to this, all members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission signed a statement by Colonel Bibrowski, the Polish alternate member, and submitted it to the Military Armistice Commission. The Polish alternate member stated in the declaration that the Polish and Czechoslovak neutral countries personnel were riding in dilapidated third-class carriages when they were sent to South Korea to work on the 20th. Because there was no loading equipment and manpower, the officers had to load heavy luggage themselves. The train did not depart until five hours late. They did not receive drinking water all day, and they only received field rations at noon.

At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 28th, both sides agreed to grant complete freedom to the Indian personnel of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission who began to arrive in Korea in the demilitarized zone responsible for guarding the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war in terms of activities and access.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 29th: At the meeting on the 29th, Zhu Ran, Colonel and Secretary-General of our side of the Military Armistice Commission, once again raised an incident of a US military aircraft violating the armistice agreement and intruding into our area for reconnaissance, requesting the US side to pay attention and take responsibility for stopping it. At around 4:15 pm on the 27th, a US military aircraft intruded into our airspace south of Sihyeon-ri, southeast of Kimhwa, and went deep into the northeast of Jwasudong, four to five kilometers behind the demilitarized zone, and then turned southeast to Hill 949.2 and flew south.

Up to now, the record of US violations of the armistice agreement has increased to forty-eight times. Although the US side has been forced to admit the seven incidents of US ground personnel violating the agreement raised by our side, it has only admitted four of the thirty-six incidents of US military aircraft violating the armistice agreement, and still refuses to admit the other thirty-two incidents. Along with the US side's irresponsible attitude towards these violations of the armistice agreement, incidents of US military aircraft violating the armistice agreement by intruding into our area for reconnaissance and violations of the agreement by ground personnel continue to occur.

### 李相朝中将在军事停战委员会上  指出美方企图推卸美机违反协定的责任

    李相朝中将在军事停战委员会上
    指出美方企图推卸美机违反协定的责任
    【新华社开城二十八日电】在军事停战委员会二十八日会议上，美方首席委员勃里安企图制造藉口，为美国军用飞机继续侵入我方地区进行侦察的行为推卸责任。
    勃里安在会议上对朝中方面八日提出要求美方注意的十二次美国军用飞机违反停战协定侵入我方地区进行侦察事件中的九次事件，都拒不承认。勃里安声称，只要美方认为关于美国军用飞机违反协议事件的材料不够充分，没有说明违反协议的美国飞机的类型，美方将拒绝对今后的任何美国军用飞机违反协议事件进行调查。他并且毫无根据地说，这些飞越军事分界线的军用飞机可能是朝中方面的。
    朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军在会上严正指出：勃里安的发言只是企图推卸美方对违反停战协定的责任。美国军用飞机违反协议的事件仍在继续发生和增加，这证明美方并未采取措施对此类事件予以制止。李相朝将军声明，朝中方面将不受勃里安这一声明的约束。
    然而，勃里安今天也不得不承认美国军用飞机一架，在五日曾连续三次违反停战协定，侵入朔宁附近我方非军事区上空进行侦察。到现在为止，朝中方面提出要求美方注意的三十五次美国军用飞机违反停战协定的事件，都列举了确切的时间、美国飞机的架数和侵入的具体地点的经纬度。而且这些飞机飞行的方向及活动的地区，都证明它们是从美方控制下的地区飞来，然后又向美方地区飞去。这些无可辩驳的事实，是勃里安绝对无法否认的。他的发言表明，美方正想在事前制造藉口，为美方蓄意继续违反停战协定、派遣军用飞机侵入我方地区进行侦察的行为推卸责任。
    李相朝将军在二十八日的会议上，对二十日派赴南朝鲜特定后方口岸的中立国视察小组人员在美方控制地区内遭遇的困难，表示深切的关怀。在此以前，中立国监察委员会全体委员签名以波兰候补委员毕勃洛夫斯基上校的声明一件，送交军事停战委员会。波兰候补委员在声明中叙述，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两中立国的人员，在二十日派赴南朝鲜工作时乘坐的是破陋的三等车，因为没有装车的设备和人力，军官们竟须自己动手装载沉重的行李，火车在迟延五小时以后才开出，他们整天得不到饮水，到中午才领到战地口粮。
    在军事停战委员会二十八日的会议上，双方同意对开始到达朝鲜的中立国遣返委员会的印度人员，在负责看管不直接遣返战俘的非军事区内的活动和出入，给予完全的自由。
    【新华社开城二十九日电】军事停战委员会我方秘书长朱然上校，在二十九日的会议上又提出一次美国军用飞机违反停战协定侵入我方地区进行侦察的事件，要求美方注意并负责制止。在二十七日下午四时十五分左右，美国军用飞机一架在金城东南的细岘里以南侵入我方上空，深入非军事区后方四至五公里的座首洞东北，然后折回东南至九四九点二高地向南飞去。
    到现在为止，美方违反停战协定事件的记录已增加到四十八次。虽然美方已被迫承认我方提出的美方地面人员违反协议的七次事件，但对美国军用飞机的三十六次违反停战协定事件，仅承认了其中的四次，对其他三十二次仍拒不承认。与美方对这种违反停战协定事件采取不负责任的态度同时，美国军用飞机违反停战协定侵入我方地区进行侦察和地面人员违反协议的事件仍在不断地发生。
