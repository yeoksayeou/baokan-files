    CPC Central Committee South Central Bureau Convenes Basic Construction Conference
    Determines to Strengthen Party Leadership over Basic Construction

    [This newspaper's dispatch] The South Central Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a basic construction conference in late July, clearly stipulating the basic construction guidelines for the South Central region for the second half of this year, exchanging work experiences, and determining several effective measures to ensure the completion of basic construction tasks.

    In January of this year, the South Central Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a industrial and mining conference, clearly stipulating that basic construction should be given top priority. Over the past six months, many achievements have been made. All cadres have a further understanding of the significance of "giving top priority to basic construction." The leadership and cadre strength in basic construction have been gradually strengthened. Relevant construction and design institutions are also being gradually established. Various tasks this year have started on a large scale, and the completion of project plans has been improving month by month. In terms of construction, some advanced units have overfulfilled their engineering tasks for June of this year. After half a year of democratic reform work, the level of consciousness of the working masses has also been improved. In terms of design strength, the nine design units under the South Central Construction Engineering Bureau alone have assembled more than 1,010 designers. In terms of construction institutions, a number of specialized engineering units have also been reorganized and newly established. Some units have been able to undertake the construction of factories and the installation of machinery. Other forces such as surveying and drilling have also been gradually organized. The work of the Party, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League in basic construction is also gradually being strengthened. At the same time, by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the whole country, some advanced experiences have been created and some advanced work units have emerged in the South Central region, which has created favorable conditions for further learning and promoting advanced experience in the future. However, due to the rashness of the overall plan, the slow determination of tasks, the lack of planning in construction management, and the weakness of political work on the construction site, the working masses have not been well mobilized, resulting in the chaos, waste, and lack of responsibility in the first half of the year still being quite serious, and quality rework accidents have occurred repeatedly in some projects. Therefore, the entire region only completed 25% of the total annual task in the first half of the year. The waste of manpower in design and construction is also very serious, and it is far from meeting the requirements of "good, fast, and economical."

    The conference specifically analyzed and studied the current situation of basic construction in the South Central region, and believed that it is necessary to further overcome the rashness in basic construction, prioritize projects according to their importance and urgency, and decided that all provinces and cities must complete the project prioritization work in August. At the same time, effective measures must be taken to balance the imbalance of materials and labor. The meeting also clearly pointed out that promoting operation plans in construction is the central link to overcome chaos and complete the basic construction plan for the second half of the year. In order to implement planned management, it is necessary to start simultaneously in the basic construction leading departments and construction departments. In the construction unit, it is first necessary to establish a construction operation plan, scheduling work, and a grassroots record system. After the plan is formulated, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to discuss and organize forces to complete it. It is also necessary to establish a regular inspection system to understand the implementation of the plan at any time in order to urge the implementation of the plan. Both the construction unit and the construction unit must strengthen the overall concept and closely cooperate to ensure the completion of the task. Around plan management, each construction unit must also focus on and establish some preliminary responsibility systems in a planned manner, and promote advanced experiences such as parallel assembly line operations, prefabricated installation, and rapid drilling to improve project quality and work efficiency.

    The conference also studied the issue of strengthening the Party's leadership over basic construction work. It was believed that since basic construction is a new task, it is inevitable that many shortcomings will arise in the process of advancement. However, the work in the first half of the year showed that wherever the Party organization grasps the basic construction work more tightly, there will be fewer shortcomings and the work will be done better; therefore, it is of utmost importance to further strengthen the leadership of the Party committees at all levels over basic construction work. In the future, the Party's leadership over basic construction work must continue to be strengthened, and the local Party committees must immediately correct the sporadic and passive state of leadership over basic construction in the past and correct the view that they can be irresponsible for the basic construction plan. It is required that the Party committees of all provinces and cities must hold regular meetings to study basic construction work and effectively ensure the completion of the basic construction plan.

    The second aspect of strengthening the Party's leadership is to strengthen the Party's ideological work. First of all, it is necessary to help cadres solve the difficulties of not being familiar with the business and not being able to delve into it, and organize cadres to strengthen theoretical and professional learning. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen political work among employees to inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, tap the potential of production, and solve some specific problems in the lives of employees as needed and as possible (such as adjusting wages, etc.). It must be recognized that only when the masses are truly mobilized can the completion of the plan be guaranteed.

    The third aspect of strengthening the Party's leadership is to strengthen the Party's leadership at the grassroots level of basic construction and to enrich the grassroots cadres, and to send capable Party cadres to the construction site. The work of uniting and transforming technical personnel should also be further noted.

    The conference pointed out that according to the requirements of the national construction plan, the basic construction tasks in the South Central region will continue to increase year by year in the future. In order to strive for the initiative in next year's work and accept the experiences and lessons of this year, from now on, all localities must start selecting factory sites and collecting and studying materials, must pay attention to strengthening the strength of surveying and design, and must improve the ideological level and technical level of existing designers by summarizing work, holding seminars, giving lectures, learning from advanced Soviet experience, going to construction sites, and organizing visits. At the same time, it is necessary to train and cultivate surveying and mapping personnel, geological personnel, and various types of technical workers in a planned manner, establish material testing laboratories, and strengthen urban surveying and planning, solve the problem of using farmers' land for building factories, etc.

    中共中央中南局召开基本建设会议
    确定加强党对基本建设的领导
    【本报讯】中共中央中南局于七月下旬召开基本建设会议，明确规定了今年下半年中南区基本建设方针，交流了工作经验，并确定了若干有效措施，以保证基本建设任务的完成。
    今年一月中共中央中南局曾召开工矿会议，明确规定把基本建设放在首要地位，半年以来，已取得许多成绩。全体干部对“把基本建设放在首要地位”的意义有了进一步的认识。基本建设方面的领导力量和干部力量都在逐渐加强。有关的建筑、设计机构也在逐步建立。今年各项工作已大量开工，工程计划的完成情况已逐月好转。在施工方面，某些先进单位已超额完成了今年六月份的工程任务。经过半年的民主改革工作，工人群众的觉悟程度亦有所提高。设计力量方面，仅中南建筑工程局所属九个设计单位即已集结设计人员一千零数十人。建筑机构方面，也已整顿及新建了不少专业性的工程单位。有的单位已能负担起建筑厂房和机器安装任务。其他如勘测钻探力量也逐渐组织起来。党、工会、青年团在基本建设方面工作也在逐渐加强。同时由于学习苏联的及全国的先进经验，在中南区已创造了一些先进的经验和出现了一些先进的工作单位，这就给今后进一步学习及推广先进经验创造了有利条件。但是由于总的计划有冒进现象，任务确定迟缓和施工管理工作上缺乏计划性，工地政治工作薄弱，工人群众还没有很好发动起来，以致上半年工作中的混乱、浪费和无人负责现象还相当严重，有的工程一再发生质量返工事故。因此全区上半年只完成了全年总任务的百分之二十五。设计和施工力量的窝工浪费也都非常厉害，还远没有达到“好、快、省”的要求。
    会议具体分析、研究了目前中南区基本建设的情况，认为必须进一步克服基本建设中的冒进现象，对工程按轻重缓急加以排队，并决定各省市必须在八月份将工程排队工作做妥。同时必须采取有效措施，对材料、劳动不平衡状况加以平衡。会议又明确指出：在施工中推行作业计划，是克服混乱现象、完成下半年基本建设计划的中心环节。为了贯彻计划管理，必须在基本建设领导部门和施工部门同时着手。在施工单位，首先要建立施工作业计划、调度工作和基层记录制度，计划制订后就要发动群众讨论，组织力量去完成。并要建立经常的检查制度，随时了解计划执行的情况，以督促计划的贯彻。兴建单位和施工单位双方必须加强整体观念，密切配合，以保证任务的完成。围绕计划管理，各施工单位又必须有重点、有步骤地建立一些初步责任制度，并推行平行流水作业、预制安装、快速钻探等先进经验，借以提高工程质量和工作效率。
    会议还研究了关于加强党对基本建设工作领导的问题。认为，由于基本建设是一个新的工作，因此就难免产生许多在前进中的缺点。但是上半年的工作说明，凡是那里的党组织对基本建设工作抓得紧些，那里的缺点就少些，工作也作得好些；因此，进一步加强各级党委对基本建设工作的领导是有头等重要意义的。今后党对基本建设工作的领导必须继续加强，地方党委要立即纠正过去对基本建设领导的那种零星被动状态和纠正对基本建设计划可以不负责任的观点。要求各省、市委必须经常开会研究基本建设工作，切实保证基本建设计划的完成。
    加强党的领导的第二个方面是加强党的思想工作。首先要帮助干部解决不熟悉业务、钻不下去的困难，组织干部加强理论和业务学习。同时要加强职工中的政治工作，以启发工人群众的积极性和创造性，发掘生产上的潜在力量；并根据需要和可能解决职工生活中的一些具体问题（如调整工资等）。必须认识，只有群众真正发动起来了，计划的完成才会有保证。
    加强党的领导的第三个方面是加强党对基本建设基层的领导和充实基层干部，要把有能力的党的干部派到工地去。对技术人员的团结和改造工作，亦应进一步加以注意。
    会议指出，根据国家建设计划的要求，今后中南区的基本建设的任务还将年年增加。为争取明年工作的主动，接受今年的经验教训，从现在开始，各地就必须着手进行厂址的选择和资料的搜集研究工作，必须注意加强勘测设计的力量，必须通过总结工作、开座谈会、讲课、学习苏联先进经验和下工地及组织参观等方式，提高现有设计人员的思想水平和技术水平。同时要有计划地训练和培养测绘人员、地质人员及各类技术工人，建立材料试验室，并要加强城市的测量和规划工作，解决建厂使用农民土地问题等。
