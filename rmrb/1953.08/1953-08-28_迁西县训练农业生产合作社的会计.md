    Qianxi County Trains Agricultural Production Cooperative Accountants
    Qianxi County, Hebei Province, has a total of twenty-eight agricultural production cooperatives and eight mutual aid teams that have invested land but have not yet been approved to be converted into cooperatives. Although the accountants of these cooperatives and teams received accounting training last winter, they still found it very difficult to keep accounts, and the accounts they kept were very chaotic. For example, Guo Xinghua, the accountant of the Dongying Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the First District, could not keep accounts. He wrote people's names in the voucher column, amounts in the summary column, and left the number column blank. Because the accounts were not well kept, both the accountants and the cooperative members had great ideological concerns. The accountants were afraid that they would have to pay money and be accused of embezzlement if they could not settle the accounts clearly, and the cooperative members were afraid that they would not be able to distribute the profits well if they could not settle the accounts clearly after the autumn harvest. Some cooperative members said: "The accounts are already in a mess before autumn, and they will be even more chaotic in autumn. How can we do a good job of distribution?" Therefore, the cooperative members were very uneasy in production, and some even asked to withdraw from the cooperatives and teams. The team leaders and cooperative directors were also worried about this matter. As soon as the cadres of the county leadership organs went to the countryside, they asked for help in solving this problem.
    Based on the above situation, the Qianxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after careful research, decided to conduct a universal training for the accountants of all the teams and cooperatives in the county on the principle of not affecting production. The training method was to transfer a part of the accountants from the county leading organs to do a good job in one key area, and let them work with the accountants of the key teams and cooperatives, and jointly study and study according to the actual problems encountered in the work of the accountants, and gain experience. Then, all the teams and cooperatives in the county were divided into four areas, and training was carried out in each area separately. Their specific method of training in Daheitin Village, Fifth District, was: the four accountants who were trained brought all the accounts and vouchers. They began to explain the principles of bookkeeping in conjunction with the problems encountered by the accountants of each team and cooperative in their actual work, and then systematically explained and sorted out the accounts of one cooperative, focusing on analyzing and discussing the common problems of everyone, until the problems were clarified. This method of training, because it was combined with practice, had very good results. From the end of June, it only took half a month for the four areas in the county to train the accountants of eight teams and thirty-five cooperatives in three phases (five days each), and most of the teams and cooperatives settled the accounts for the first half of the year. Now the accountants of each team and cooperative are working with peace of mind, and the cooperative members have also dispelled their worries about not being able to distribute the profits well after the autumn harvest.

    迁西县训练农业生产合作社的会计
    河北省迁西县共有二十八个农业生产合作社，和八个土地入了股但还没有被批准转社的互助组。这些社和组的会计人员在去年冬天虽然受过一次会计训练，但是记起账来仍然很困难，所记的账目十分混乱。如一区东营村农业生产合作社会计郭兴华就不会记账，在单据凭证栏内写人名，摘要栏内写数目，数字栏内却是空白的。因为账记得不好，会计和社员都有很大的思想顾虑，会计们怕算不清账要赔钱和背贪污罪名，社员们怕秋后算不清账分配不好。有的社员说：“还没有到秋天账码就乱了，到秋天那就更乱了，怎么能作好分配工作呢？”因此，社员们在生产中很不安心，甚至有的人要求退社退组。各组组长、各社社长也为这件事发愁，县领导机关的干部一下乡，他们就要求帮助解决这个问题。
    中共迁西县委根据以上情况，经过周密研究后，决定在不影响生产的原则下把全县的组、社会计进行一次普遍训练。训练的办法是从县领导机关抽调一部分会计搞好一个重点，让他们和重点组、社的会计在一块，根据会计在工作中所发生的实际问题，共同研究，共同学习，取得经验。然后再把全县各组、社划分在四个片内，分别在各片进行训练。他们在五区大黑汀村进行训练的具体作法是：受训的四名会计把所有的账目、单据带来。他们开始结合各组、社会计在实际工作中碰到的问题，把记账的道理讲清，然后再通过一个社的账目进行有系统地讲解和整理，着重分析讨论大家普遍存在的问题，直到问题弄清楚为止。这样训练的方法，因为结合实际，效果很好。从六月下旬起，只用了半个月的时间，全县四个片分三期（每期五天）共训练了八个组、三十五个社的会计，绝大部分组、社并把半年来的账目算清了。现在各组、社的会计都安心工作，社员们怕秋后分配不好的顾虑也打消了。
