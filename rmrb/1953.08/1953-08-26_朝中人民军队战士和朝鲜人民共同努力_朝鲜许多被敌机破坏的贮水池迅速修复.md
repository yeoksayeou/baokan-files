Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 25th: The reservoirs of Jianlong, Cimu, Linyuan, Guicheng, and others in Korea, which were destroyed by barbaric bombing by American aircraft, have been successively repaired and completed due to the active repairs by soldiers of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, Korean working people, and technicians.

In order to complete the repair projects of various reservoirs ahead of schedule and ensure a bumper harvest of vast farmland, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies and Korean working people participating in the repair work launched a warm competition, and the project progressed very smoothly. For example, the huge repair project of Jianlong Reservoir was successfully completed in just 85 days. People in the areas where the reservoirs are located held grand completion ceremonies on-site after the reservoirs were fully repaired.

On the day of the completion ceremony of Jianlong Reservoir on the 17th, the soldiers of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies who participated in the repair work, Korean workers, technicians, transportation team members, and local farmers all gathered at the venue. At the meeting, the Korean people unanimously expressed their gratitude for the strong assistance of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. When Park Mun-kyu, Minister of Agriculture of the Korean Cabinet, read Marshal Kim Il-sung's letter of thanks to the warriors of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who assisted in repairing the reservoir, thunderous cheers and applause erupted throughout the venue.

The director of the Jianlong Reservoir reconstruction project announced at the meeting that in order to thank the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the warriors of the Korean People's Army for their meritorious service in the repair work of Jianlong Reservoir, the people of South Pyongan Province have erected a monument for them.

The warriors of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies who participated in the repair project sent letters to Marshal Kim Il-sung respectively. The warriors of the People's Army expressed their determination to respond to the leader's call and actively participate in the cause of restoring and building the motherland. The warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army expressed that they would unite more firmly with the heroic Korean people and do everything possible to help the Korean people carry out the cause of restoration and construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, August 25th: Soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are assisting the Korean people in repairing the Shiyan Reservoir, which was destroyed by the bombing of the US imperialist invading Korean air force. The soldiers and the Korean People's Army are working hard in the scorching sun, in the rain, and in the waist-deep silt. In the first ten days of the project, the soldiers rushed to repair a 2,400-meter-long temporary dam, blocking the floodwaters. Then, the construction of a permanent dam began. At present, the repair project of Shiyan Reservoir has been fully completed.

Shiyan Reservoir is located at the junction of Pyongwon County and Sunan County in South Pyongan Province, Korea. The reservoir is more than 30 kilometers around, and the water storage capacity is 34.12 million cubic meters, which can irrigate more than 3,400 hectares of land. For 23 years, it has guaranteed the bumper harvest of large areas of land for farmers in this area. In order to destroy this peaceful construction, the US Air Force dispatched more than 100 aircraft sorties to carry out concentrated bombing of the reservoir on May 13th and 14th. Enemy aircraft dropped a large number of heavy bombs on the reservoir dam. As a result, the reservoir dam was destroyed, and the floodwaters flooded large areas of farmland in Sunan County, Pyongwon County, Daedong County, and the suburbs of Pyongyang City in South Pyongan Province, destroying more than 2,000 houses and many grains, livestock, and farm tools, and drowning more than 800 Korean people. At that time, the Korean government and the Korean and Chinese People's forces carried out rescue operations and immediately began to repair the reservoir.

    朝鲜许多被敌机破坏的贮水池迅速修复
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】因美机野蛮轰炸而遭到破坏的朝鲜见龙、慈母、林原、龟城等贮水池，由于朝中人民军队战士、朝鲜劳动人民和技术人员的积极抢修，已先后修复完工。
    为了提前完成各个贮水池的修复工程，保障广大农田的丰收，参加修复工作的朝中人民军队和朝鲜劳动人民曾展开了热烈的竞赛，工程进行得很顺利。例如，见龙贮水池的巨大修复工程，在短短的八十五天中就已胜利竣工。各个贮水池所在地区的人民，当贮水池完全修复以后，都在现场举行了盛大的竣工典礼。
    在十七日见龙贮水池举行竣工典礼的那一天，参加修复工作的朝中人民军队勇士们、朝鲜工人、技术人员、运输队员和当地的农民都齐聚到会场。会上，朝鲜人民一致表示感激朝中人民军队的大力援助。当朝鲜内阁农业相朴文圭朗读了金日成元帅给协助修复贮水池的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军勇士们的感谢信时，全场响起了经久不息的欢呼和掌声。
    见龙贮水池恢复建设事业所所长在会上宣布：为了感谢中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军勇士们在抢修见龙贮水池工作中立下的功勋，平安南道的人民已给他们竖立了纪念碑。
    参加修复工程的朝中人民军队勇士们分别致函金日成元帅。人民军勇士们表示要响应领袖的号召，积极参加恢复建设祖国的事业。中国人民志愿军勇士们表示要和英雄的朝鲜人民更加巩固地团结起来，尽一切力量帮助朝鲜人民进行恢复建设事业。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十五日电】中国人民志愿军某部战士正在协助朝鲜人民，修复遭美帝国主义侵朝空军炸毁的石岩贮水池。战士们和朝鲜人民军一起，在烈日下、暴雨中，在深及腰部的淤泥中紧张地劳动着。在工程开始的头十天中，战士们就抢修起了一条二千四百公尺长的临时堤坝，阻住了泛滥的水流。接着，就进行永久性堤坝的建设工程。目前，石岩贮水池的修复工程，已经全部完工。
    石岩贮水池位于朝鲜平安南道平原郡和顺安郡交界的地方。贮水池周围达三十多公里，贮水量达三千四百十二万立方公尺，可灌溉三千四百多公顷土地。二十三年来，它保证了这一带农民大片土地的丰收。美国空军为了炸毁这个和平建设，在五月十三、十四日，曾先后出动飞机一百多架次对贮水池进行集中轰炸。敌机向贮水池的堤坝投下了大批重磅炸弹。结果，炸毁了贮水池的堤坝，洪水淹没了平安南道顺安郡、平原郡、大同郡和平壤市郊区的大片田地，冲坏了两千多间房舍和许多粮食、牲畜和农具，溺毙了八百多个朝鲜人民。当时，朝鲜政府和朝中人民部队进行了抢救，并立即开始修复贮水池。
