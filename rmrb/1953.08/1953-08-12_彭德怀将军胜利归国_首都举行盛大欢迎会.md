As General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, stepped off the train to the sound of military music, he accepted flowers presented by student representatives from Beijing and three female representatives from the Korean Embassy in China.

Guo Moruo first extended a warm and sincere welcome and gratitude to Commander Peng Dehuai on behalf of all the people of China.

Your victory is the victory of the people of the world, the victory of peace, the victory of democracy, and the victory of justice. After narrating the great victory achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield and the achievements and significance of the armistice negotiations, Guo Moruo said: "The American war-mongers are still manipulating the Lee Seung-man puppet regime, attempting to sabotage the political conference and resume the war. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance and continue to support the Korean people so that the Korean issue can be truly resolved peacefully. We must continue to help the Korean people heal the war wounds caused by imperialist aggression and quickly restore their peaceful and happy life." (Full text to be published separately)

Xu Zhe, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, delivered a speech at the rally. He first extended a warm welcome and congratulations to the triumphant Commander Peng Dehuai, and expressed his deep gratitude to Commander Peng Dehuai and all the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Subsequently, Xu Zhe, after narrating the great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side, said: The US imperialist aggressors are not reconciled to defeat. However, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have maintained a high degree of vigilance to prevent him from undermining the conspiracy of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The forces of democratic peace will surely defeat the forces of aggressive war. Xu Zhe finally said: The Korean people, with the sincere assistance of the great Soviet Union and other democratic countries headed by China, will surely be able to quickly complete their post-war recovery and construction.

General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, delivered a speech amidst enduring applause and cheers.

Commander Peng Dehuai first expressed, on behalf of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, his respect to the great people of the motherland, from whom they have been separated for more than two years, and to the great leader Chairman Mao, and expressed his heartfelt thanks to the people of the motherland who have wholeheartedly supported the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Commander Peng Dehuai said: Now Korea has achieved an armistice. We warmly welcome the armistice and will resolutely implement all the provisions of the armistice agreement, because this is the result of our struggle. But this is only the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Belligerent elements in the United Nations forces, especially the South Korean Lee Seung-man clique, may undermine the armistice agreement at any time. The people of the world must monitor their conspiracies with a high degree of vigilance. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is now continuing to be with the Korean people, holding fast to its glorious post, and striving to ensure the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. We believe that if the enemy dares to break faith and undermine the armistice agreement and launch another aggression, it will suffer an even more shameful defeat.

    中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在军乐声中下车，接受北京市学生代表和朝鲜驻我国大使馆三位女代表的献花。这时，结满红色彩球的月台上，掌声和欢呼声响成一片。欢迎的人们挥动手中的鲜花向凯旋归来的彭德怀司令员表示崇高的敬意。 “欢迎中国人民志愿军彭德怀司令员胜利归国大会”在乐队高奏“中国人民志愿军战歌”乐声中开始。首由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席、中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若致欢迎词。郭沫若首先代表全中国人民向彭德怀司令员表示热烈的诚恳的欢迎和感谢。他说：全中国的人民都感谢你们，全世界爱好和平的人们都感谢你们。你们的胜利是全世界人民的胜利，是和平的胜利，民主的胜利，正义的胜利。郭沫若在叙述了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜战场上所取得的伟大胜利和停战谈判中所取得的成就及其意义后说：“美国的战争贩子们依然在操纵着李承晚傀儡，企图破坏政治会议，恢复战争。我们要保持着高度的警惕，要继续不断地支持朝鲜人民，使朝鲜问题得到真正的和平解决。我们要继续帮助朝鲜人民医治由于帝国主义侵略而带来的战争创伤，迅速恢复其和平幸福的生活。”（全文另发）
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻我国大使馆临时代办徐哲在会上致词。他首先向胜利凯旋的彭德怀司令员表示热烈的欢迎和祝贺，并向彭德怀司令员及中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员表示深深的感谢。接着，徐哲在叙述了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战中的伟大胜利之后说：美帝国主义侵略者还不甘心失败。但是，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军保持了高度的警惕，防止他破坏朝鲜停战协定的阴谋。民主和平力量一定能战胜侵略战争力量。徐哲最后说：朝鲜人民在伟大的苏联和中国为首的各民主国家的诚心诚意的援助之下，一定能很快的完成其战后恢复和建设事业。
    中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在经久不息的掌声和欢呼声中致词。
    彭德怀司令员首先代表中国人民志愿军向分别了两年多的伟大的祖国人民致敬，向伟大的领袖毛主席致敬，向全力支援中国人民志愿军的祖国人民，表示衷心的感谢。
    彭德怀司令员说：现在朝鲜已经停战了。我们热烈欢迎停战，并将坚决执行停战协定的一切规定，因为这是我们奋斗得来的结果。但这只是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。联合国军中的好战分子，尤其是南朝鲜李承晚集团，可能随时破坏停战协定。全世界人民必须以高度的警惕监视着他们的阴谋活动。中国人民志愿军现在正继续与朝鲜人民在一起，坚守自己光荣的岗位，为保障朝鲜停战协定的彻底实现，争取和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗。我们相信，如果敌人敢于背信弃义破坏停战协定，再一次发动侵略，即将遭到更可耻的失败。（全文另发）（附图片）
