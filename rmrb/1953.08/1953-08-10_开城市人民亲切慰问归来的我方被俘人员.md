Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th: The personnel captured by our side who have returned to the embrace of the motherland have received cordial greetings from people from all walks of life in Kaesong City.

Along the roads from the handover zone on our side in Panmunjom to the hygiene transit area and to the various reception stations, large numbers of Korean people wave the national flags of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, singing songs to welcome the returning personnel every day. In the open-air theaters of the reception stations, theatrical troupes of the troops, various theatrical troupes of Kaesong City, various schools, rural music and dance teams, and film projection teams take turns performing every day. A comfort meeting is held here every day, with representatives from all walks of life in Kaesong City, families of the Korean People's Army, and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers participating. At a comfort meeting, Yoon Hee-myung, a representative of housewives, said to the returning personnel: "Your families and mothers have been longing for your return for a long time. Now, a part of all the personnel captured by our side—you—have returned. This is the result of the victory of the Korean and Chinese people fighting on the battlefield and at the conference table, and it is also the result of your persistent struggle against forced detention in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps!"

The returning personnel expressed their deep gratitude to the people of the motherland for their concern.

On the 7th, the returning personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers held a symposium. At the meeting, Li Yanhan, a returning personnel, spoke about his eagerness to return to the country in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp. He said: "Although we suffered all kinds of hardships in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, we believe that victory must belong to us. How much we hope that victory will come sooner and that we can return to the embrace of the motherland immediately!" Wang Wentao, a returning personnel, recalled the moving scene of our captured personnel meeting with members of our Red Cross team in Munsan, saying: "The U.S. initially obstructed us from meeting with our Red Cross personnel. Later, after our struggle, we were allowed to send a representative to meet them. When all of us saw our representative embracing our Red Cross personnel tightly inside the barbed wire, we were all moved to tears. When our Red Cross personnel reported the situation of the motherland's construction with a loudspeaker, we all rushed to the barbed wire and listened attentively to every word with excitement. How eager we were to know the news of the motherland!" Yan Zhixie, a returning personnel, said: "In the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, the enemy used tanks, bayonets, and poison gas bombs to kill us, but we never gave in. We would rather shed blood than shed a tear. This time, after returning to the embrace of the motherland, we have received the cordial care of the Korean and Chinese people, and we are all so grateful that we cannot help but cry."

The returning personnel all expressed that they will study hard in the future and actively participate in the construction of the motherland to repay the care of the people of the motherland.

    开城市人民亲切慰问归来的我方被俘人员
    【新华社开城九日电】回到祖国怀抱的我方被俘人员，受到开城市各界人民的亲切慰问。
    在板门店我方交接区到卫生通过区以及各个招待站的路旁，每天都有大批的朝鲜人民摇着朝、中、苏三国国旗，唱着歌欢迎归来人员。各招待站的露天剧场里，每天都有部队文工团、开城市各剧团、各学校、乡村的音乐舞蹈队和电影放映队轮流前来进行演出。每天这里都举行慰问大会，开城市各界人民和朝鲜人民军家属以及朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军都有代表参加。在一次慰问大会上，家庭妇女代表尹姬明对归来人员说：“你们的家属和母亲都长期盼望着你们回来。现在我方全部被俘人员中的一部分——你们，是回来了。这是朝、中人民在战场上、会场上斗争的胜利结果，也是你们在美方战俘营里坚持斗争、反对强迫扣留的胜利结果！”
    归来人员对祖国人民对他们的关怀表示十分感激。
    七日，中国人民志愿军归来人员举行了一次座谈会，会上，归来人员李炎翰讲到在美方战俘营中急切期待回国的心情。他说：“虽然，我们在美方战俘营里受尽了苦难，但是我们相信胜利一定是属于我们的。我们是多么希望胜利早一天到来，马上能够回到祖国的怀抱里来啊！”归来人员王文涛回忆我方被俘人员在汶山与我方红十字会小组人员会面的动人情景说：“美方最初阻挠我们和我方红十字会人员见面，后来，经过我们的斗争，才准我们派一个代表去会见。当我们全体人员在铁丝网内看到自己的代表紧紧拥抱着我方红十字会人员时，我们都感动得哭起来了。在我方红十字会人员用扩音机报告祖国建设的情形时，我们一齐拥到铁丝网边，兴奋地静听每一句话。我们是多么渴望知道祖国的消息啊！”归来人员严智燮说：“在美方战俘营中，敌人用坦克、刺刀、毒气弹等来杀害我们，我们决不屈服。我们宁可流血，但是不愿流一滴眼泪。这次重回祖国怀抱以后，受到朝中人民的亲切关怀，我们都感激得不由自主地哭起来了。”
    归来人员都表示今后要努力学习，积极参加祖国建设事业，来报答祖国人民对他们的关怀。
