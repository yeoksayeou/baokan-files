    Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Supplying Materials for the Purchase of Agricultural Crops
    Currently, the situation regarding the purchase of wheat is as follows: the peak season for purchasing wheat in the southern wheat-producing areas is about to pass, but there is still a certain amount being put on the market; the northern major wheat-producing areas are in the peak season for purchasing, but the amount purchased so far is far from meeting the state's requirements. This shows that the work of purchasing wheat has entered a more intensive stage. In order to ensure that this year's purchased wheat can fully meet the needs of the country, all state-owned commercial, cooperative, and related departments must cooperate closely and continue to work hard to strive for greater achievements in the work of purchasing wheat.
    One of the most prominent problems in the current wheat purchasing work is that the supply of means of production and means of livelihood cannot meet the needs of the farmers, and the means of production and several major daily necessities that farmers urgently need to replenish after selling wheat are severely out of stock. Due to the shortage of material supply, the interest of farmers in selling wheat has been greatly affected, and the amount of wheat on the market has been reduced. If this situation is not quickly improved, it will not only affect the current wheat purchasing work, but also have an adverse effect on the upcoming autumn crop purchasing work. State-owned commercial and cooperative workers in various regions should pay serious attention to this.
    Experience has shown that in areas where correct price policies have been implemented, necessary political work has been carried out, material preparations have been actively made, seasonal supplies have been grasped tightly, and the needs of farmers for means of production and livelihood after selling wheat have been met, the amount of wheat on the market is large, the amount of wheat purchased is also large, and the supply business of cooperatives and state-owned commercial enterprises also expands accordingly. According to statistics from the Xinxiang Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Henan Province in July, after the new wheat was put on the market, more than 1,000 purchase and sales points and mobile groups were set up in the entire district. From July 1st to 25th, the total number of purchases exceeded 21% of the provincial cooperative's regulations, an increase of 122% compared with June and 469% compared with the same period last year. In terms of supply, from June 1st to July 20th, the total value of means of production such as waterwheels, fertilizers, livestock, and agricultural implements and means of livelihood such as cloth, department stores, and edible salt supplied was nearly 29.3 billion yuan, an increase of more than 40% compared with the same period last year. Among them, the Liancun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanbiao Township, Jixian County, purchased 180,000 catties of wheat, and at the same time supplied 90,000 catties of soybean cake and other means of livelihood such as cloth, totaling more than 50 million yuan, and recovered more than 10 million yuan in loans on behalf of the bank. The total amount of currency withdrawn accounted for 87% of the total amount released. These experiences of the Xinxiang Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative should be promoted.
    Some state-owned commercial and cooperative cadres lack a full understanding of the fact that farmers sell grain to buy goods, and therefore cannot correctly arrange their own business. They only focus on purchasing and neglect supply, and as a result, the purchasing work will certainly not be done well. In Dashiqiao, Lin颍 County, Henan Province, a farmer sold a dou of wheat, and the wheat had already been poured into the bucket, but when he heard that the cooperative had no fertilizer, he asked for the wheat back. This is a very obvious example. Generally speaking, in the early stage of wheat purchasing, most of the farmers who sell wheat are relatively poor, and they are eager to sell wheat in order to repay debts and solve pressing production difficulties. In the later stage, more grain sellers will be farmers and middle peasants with abundant harvests, and they generally do not urgently need cash. They sell surplus grain in order to satisfy their material needs in other aspects. Therefore, strengthening the supply of materials to them plays a more important role.
    This year, summer crops have had a bumper harvest in most parts of the country, and if there are no special disasters in the future, the autumn harvest may also be good. State-owned commercial and cooperative enterprises are now facing the important task of supplying farmers and members with means of production and livelihood during the autumn harvest season. Supplying farmers with cheap and high-quality supplies is not only to smoothly complete the current task of purchasing wheat, but also an important guarantee for the successful completion of the state's task of purchasing autumn crops this year, and an important measure to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. All staff members of state-owned commercial and cooperative enterprises should learn from the fact that the supply of materials was insufficient during the wheat purchasing period this year, quickly make ideological preparations, understand the needs of farmers and members, actively expand sources of goods, replenish reserves, and promptly do a good job in the transfer of materials, so that the supply of materials during the autumn harvest season can proceed smoothly.

### 切实做好收购农作物中的物资供应工作

    切实做好收购农作物中的物资供应工作
    目前收购小麦的情况是：南方产麦区收购的旺季将要过去，但仍保持有一定的上市量；北方主要产麦区正值收购的旺季，但目前已收购的数字距离国家的要求还很远。这说明收购小麦的工作已进入更紧张的阶段。为使今年收购的小麦能充分满足国家的需要，全体国营商业、合作社和有关部门的工作人员，必须密切配合，继续努力，以争取收购小麦工作获得更大成绩。
    目前收购小麦工作中最突出的问题之一，是生产资料、生活资料的供应不能满足农民的需要，农民出售小麦后急需添补的生产资料和若干种主要的生活日用品严重脱销。由于物资供应的不足，大大地影响了农民出售小麦的兴趣，减少了小麦上市的数量。这种状况如果不迅速求得改进，不但会影响当前的收购小麦工作，对即将到来的秋季作物的收购工作，也将有不良影响。各地国营商业和合作社的工作人员对这一点应引起严重的注意。
    经验证明，凡是贯彻了正确的价格政策和进行了必要的政治工作，积极作好物资准备，抓紧季节性供应，满足了农民在出售小麦后对生产、生活资料的需要的地区，小麦上市量就大，小麦收购量也大，合作社和国营商业的供应业务也随之扩大。河南省新乡专区供销合作社七月份统计，新麦上市后，全区设立购销结合的点和流动小组有一千余个，从七月一日到二十五日，收购总数超过省合作社规定的百分之二十一，比六月份增加百分之一二二，为去年同期的百分之四六九。供应方面，从六月一日到七月二十日，供应了水车、肥料、牲口、农具等生产资料和布匹、百货、食盐等生活资料总值近二九三亿元，比去年同期增加了百分之四十多。其中汲县山彪乡联村供销社，收购小麦十八万斤，同时供应了豆饼九万斤，及布匹等生活资料计五千多万元，代银行收回贷款一千多万元，总计货币回笼额占投放总额的百分之八十七。新乡专区供销合作社的这些经验，是应该提倡的。
    有些国营商业和合作社干部，对农民为买货才卖粮的这一情况缺乏充分的认识，因而也不能正确地安排自己的业务。他们只偏重收购，忽视供应，结果收购工作一定作不好。河南省临颍县大石桥有农民卖出小麦一斗，小麦已倒入斗内，但听说合作社没有肥田粉了，又把小麦要了回来，这就是一个很明显的例子。一般地说，在开始收购小麦的初期，出售小麦的大都是比较贫苦的农民，他们为了还债和解决迫切的生产困难而急于售出小麦。到了后期，更多的卖粮户将是丰产的农民和中农，他们一般地是不急用现钱的。他们卖出余粮，是为了在其他方面满足自己的物质要求。因此，对于他们加强物资供应工作就有着更重要的作用。
    今年全国大部地区夏季作物丰收，往后如无特殊灾害，秋收也可能不坏。国营商业和合作社现已面临着在秋收旺季中供应农民、社员以生产和生活资料的重大任务。供应农民价廉物美的用品，不但是为了顺利完成当前收购小麦的任务，也是胜利完成今年国家收购秋季作物的重要保证，是进一步巩固工农联盟的重要措施。国营商业和合作社的全体工作人员，应从今年收购小麦期间物资供应不足的事实中吸取教训，迅速在思想上做好准备，了解农民、社员的需要，积极扩大货源，充实储备，及时做好物资调运工作，使秋收旺季的物资供应工作能够顺利进行。
