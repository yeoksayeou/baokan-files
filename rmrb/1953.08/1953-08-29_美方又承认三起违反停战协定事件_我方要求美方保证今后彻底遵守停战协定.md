Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 28th: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on August 28th, the United Nations Command admitted at the meeting that United Nations Command military aircraft had continuously intruded into the airspace over Bonghwa-hyeon, Gwangdae-dae, and Hill 315.6 in the Korean-Chinese side on the morning of August 5th, which were three more incidents of violating the Armistice Agreement. However, the United Nations Command attempted to evade responsibility for other series of violations of the Armistice Agreement by United Nations Command military aircraft under the pretext of so-called "insufficient information" and "impossible to investigate".

 朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在会上指出：朝中方面曾一再就联合国军军用飞机违反停战协定侵入朝中方面地区上空盘旋的事件提起联合国军方面注意，但此类事件仍不断发生。这充分证明联合国军方面并没有采取必要措施对此等违反停战协定事件加以制止，至于所谓“情报不充分”、“无从调查”则纯系联合国军方面用以抵赖其军用飞机过去曾屡次违反停战协定之藉口。联合国军方面应采取一切必要的措施与办法以保证其所有部属今后彻底遵守停战协定的全部规定。
Chief Korean-Chinese representative Li Sang-cho pointed out at the meeting: The Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly brought to the attention of the United Nations Command the incidents of United Nations Command military aircraft violating the Armistice Agreement by intruding into and circling over the areas of the Korean-Chinese side, but such incidents continue to occur. This fully proves that the United Nations Command has not taken the necessary measures to prevent such violations of the Armistice Agreement. As for the so-called "insufficient information" and "impossible to investigate," they are purely excuses used by the United Nations Command to deny that its military aircraft have repeatedly violated the Armistice Agreement in the past. The United Nations Command should take all necessary measures and methods to ensure that all its subordinates thoroughly comply with all the provisions of the Armistice Agreement in the future.

    【新华社开城二十八日电】八月二十八日军事停战委员会举行会议，联合国军方面在会上承认了联合国军军用飞机曾于八月五日上午连续侵入朝中方面的烽火岘、光大垈及三一五点六高地等地上空盘旋的又三起违反停战协定的事件，但对联合国军军用飞机其他一连串违反停战协定的事件则以所谓“情报不充分”、“无从调查”等藉口企图推卸责任。
