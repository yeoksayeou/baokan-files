    A Model for Correctly Reflecting Historical Truth
    ——Introducing the Soviet Film "Peter the Great"
    Ma Shaobo
    Screenwriters: A. Tolstoy, V. Petrov, N. Leshchenko. Director: V. Petrov. Translator: Yang Fan. Produced by the Soviet Lenfilm Studio in 1937. Translated by the Central Film Studio.

    Adapted from A. Tolstoy's novel, the film "Peter the Great" holds an outstanding achievement among Soviet historical films. It provides us with extremely profound enlightenment on how to use the method of socialist realism to deal with historical themes in terms of correctly reflecting historical facts and vividly shaping character personalities from a scientific historical perspective.
    
    Truth is the highest principle of artistic creation. When portraying historical figures, it is necessary to make a specific analysis of the characters' thoughts and behaviors in accordance with the specific historical environment, give them a fair evaluation, and make artistic expressions that are appropriate to this. This kind of work, as Engels said: "Even the development of a materialist view in a single instance requires years of scientific work in quiet study, because it is obvious that relying solely on words is not enough; this task can only be accomplished with a large amount of critically selected and fully mastered historical material." (Marx: "Critique of Political Economy")
    
    Peter was great because, under the historical conditions of the time, he brilliantly embodied the great spiritual outlook of the Russian nation. With infinite perseverance and tenacious courage, he fought against the ignorance, backwardness, hypocrisy, cowardice, complacency, and corruption of the old Russia (greedy nobles, stupid clergy, and Peter's eldest son, Alexei, were representatives of these people), "opened a window to Europe," and welcomed modern civilization. As Lenin said: "Peter accelerated the imitation of Western culture by barbaric Russia, and he did not hesitate to use barbaric means in the struggle against barbarism." (See Lenin's Selected Works, Vol. VII, p. 366, 1936, Moscow edition.) Peter resolutely eliminated all obstacles in his path of reform, defended his motherland, realized great historical tasks, and promoted the forward development of society. This was exactly the desire of the Russian people at that time.
    
    In the early 18th century, Russia's economy, culture, and military were all lagging behind Western European countries. At that time, Russia had no access to the sea, and the outlets to the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea were blocked: the Black Sea was under the power of Turkey and the Crimean Khanate, while the Baltic coast was occupied by Sweden. At that time, the struggle to acquire the Baltic Sea and recover the "ancestral lands" had become an urgent requirement for the development of Russian capitalism.
    
    The film depicts this fully. When Russia was in crisis, the nobles quarreled endlessly for their own petty interests, the clergy howled for the church's copper bells, and the cowardly Crown Prince Alexei cursed Peter to die early in order to seize the throne. Peter, at this time, was keenly aware that in the war to recover the Baltic Sea, the Russian army was defeated by the Swedish King Charles XII's army due to poor training and equipment. This brought Peter not discouragement and surrender, but a huge force for advancement. He said: "The war has just begun!" "So what if we were defeated at Narva? Science! Even if they beat us five more times, the Baltic Sea will still be ours. Bring King Charles here immediately, I will definitely kiss him gratefully - thank you for defeating us, you taught me a lesson." "The cannons are all lost, to hell with them! They were all bad anyway. Make new ones."
    
    One day in June 1709, at the Battle of the Russian-Swedish War, Peter said in his attack order:
    
    "Soldiers, the fate of our country is at hand. Do not think that you are fighting for Peter, you are fighting for the country entrusted to Peter! Fight for your own flesh and blood and your motherland! Do not be intimidated by the false name of the enemy, who claims to be invincible, because the victories you yourselves have gained have repeatedly proven that this is a lie. As for Peter, he does not spare his life, as long as Russia lives long in happiness and honor for your benefit."
    
    In order to defend the territory, he decided to build a fleet, so he established a shipyard on the banks of the Voronezh River. The young Peter personally worked as a blacksmith, and he did not care when the blacksmith called him "stupid." He understood the dignity of his motherland and trusted the strength of his motherland. The first person to donate his purse to the emperor was not a nobleman, but a merchant from a serf background, Brovkin; many peasants like Fedka joined Peter's army. What a touching scene. When Peter was recruiting soldiers, he competed with the peasant Fedka. When Peter was lifted up and thrown more than ten feet away by Fedka, Peter's reaction was unexpected: he gave Fedka a glass of wine happily and said, "Great!" "With people like this, we don't have to worry about not being able to beat Sweden!"
    
    The film gives Peter the affirmation he deserves, and sings praises of his historical achievements; but no historical hero can be free from certain limitations of the era in which they lived. When Comrade Stalin discussed the characteristics of Russia under Peter the Great, he gave an accurate evaluation of the leading role played by the aristocratic class and the newly emerging merchant class in Russia at that time, especially to Peter. However, Comrade Stalin also clearly and profoundly taught us that if we compare Tsar Peter with Lenin, it is only "a drop in the ocean."
    
    The film gives a correct representation of the historical limitations of this aristocratic emperor. The film profoundly exposes the greed and cruel exploitation of the aristocratic landlords, and describes the disasters and sufferings suffered by the serfs with sympathetic strokes. In particular, through the path taken by the peasant Fedka: "Cut off the stumbling rope with a knife and run to the free Don River!" it gradually reveals the contradictions between the aristocratic landlords and the peasants. During Peter's reign, Russian peasants held many vigorous peasant uprisings.
    
    The film's depiction of Peter himself and the people around him is real and convincing, that is, it does not conceal or embellish the defects in their character and behavior. "Brothers, there is wine and women in the city, let you play for a day and a night!" This was their mobilization slogan for the march, and indeed, from top to bottom, they all went crazy and chaotic. Emperor Peter was intoxicated with wine and women, Peter's confidant Minister Menshikov inevitably embezzled for his own benefit,... all of these are realistically depicted in the film. This is obviously different in principle from the anti-historicists who always want to portray ancient heroes as modern heroes.
    
    Several main characters in the film "Peter the Great" are depicted very deeply and with great individuality. Especially the images of Peter I (N. Simonov), Alexei (N. Cherkasov), Catherine (Tarasova), Menshikov (M. Zharov), Fedka (V. Dobrovolsky), etc. are particularly vivid. The creation of vivid images and powerful characters requires not only the method of expressing the characteristics inherent in the characters themselves, but also the structure of the work, and depends on the relationship between each character and their position in the whole event. For Peter and his son Alexei, the contrast between intelligence and stupidity, virtue and unworthiness, excellence and mediocrity, undoubtedly plays an important role. From the beginning of the film, when Peter wanted to destroy the bells to make cannons, and Alexei firmly opposed it: "The Russian bells are the most famous, and the kings of Eastern Rome say the bells sound good!" it points out the different qualities and interests between the father and son. Among all the images in the film, Peter and his son left the deepest impression on the audience. I think this is mainly because the author not only placed these images in the whole structure, in the row of images, but also closely related them to other images, and put the main contradictions, main characters and dominant ideas of the time in a prominent position. Secondly, it is because the excavation of these characters' inner world is deeper, and it is written reasonably. Everything is in accordance with the facts of life, and the twists and turns and complexity of the contradictions are truly expressed. For example, the path taken by Alexei runs counter to Peter's. He stubbornly tried to seize the throne in the arms of the conservative nobles. When Peter was critically ill, he forcibly concealed his inner joy, made the sign of the cross in front of the sickbed, and retreated to his own palace. He was simply ecstatic: "The ideal has been realized! How happy! I'm going to live in Moscow, listening to the quiet bells in peace and comfort, burn all the ships, let the Swedes take Petersburg, a disgusting place... Cut off the heads of the ministers used by my father, and use my own new people..." Unexpectedly, his father did not die, so he knelt in front of Peter and pretended to say: "Father, I pray for your health... Look, how happy we are." This crown prince is cowardly and mediocre, but he is not willing to be lonely, let alone die. He tried everything to struggle. He fled abroad like a rabid dog, asked the Pope for troops, and did not hesitate to sell his country in an attempt to replace Peter's throne. When he was brought back to the country, he obediently knelt at Peter's knees, trembling with fear, weeping bitterly, as if he were a prodigal son returning and repenting sincerely, but in fact he was still carrying out the conspiracy to overthrow Peter. The character and image depicted in this way are extraordinarily prominent, especially many subtle portrayals. For example, when Peter had his second son, the conservative nobles ran to the crown prince's bedroom and earnestly begged Alexei to become emperor, but Alexei hysterically shouted: "Get out! I can't even save my own head, and you still say such dangerous things!" (crying) He didn't not want to be emperor, but he was timid, he was afraid of death. These few words delicately depict Alexei's character. After the nobles quietly left, Alexei became fierce to his wife: "I'm afraid, my dear, I'm very afraid of my father! I want to kill him! He often walks alone in Petersburg, it's easy to kill him!" "It's easy," why didn't he kill him? Because he was timid, he was afraid of death. Another example is writing about Peter the Great opening the old windows of Russia, symbolizing the opening of a window to Europe; forcing ministers and noblewomen to drink coffee, wear wigs and dance, and cutting off Boyunov's long beard... These humorous plots show the struggle between the new and the old. Through this political struggle, Peter's character is depicted extremely well. He took the lead, personally worked as a blacksmith, competed with Fedka, beat Menshikov, forced the duke's son to study in the Netherlands. If the duke's son's servant could answer mathematics and shipbuilding, he would call the servant a naval officer and let the duke's son be his sailor, pretending to be a pilot, teasing the Pope's ambassador... All of this truly expresses Peter's character, making the whole picture colorful. Especially in the whole process of his handling of his son's treason (including recall, interrogation, judgment, execution), how vivid is the image of Peter the Great! Peter was resolute and stern in dealing with saboteurs; however, even Peter the Great, known as a "tyrant," had a delicate and rich father-son relationship, and this was expressed so realistically, reasonably, and with such extraordinary persuasive power.
    
    The film "Peter the Great" not only has the educational function of promoting the excellent traditions of history and inspiring patriotic spirit, but also provides us with successful models in terms of the creative methods, directing methods, and acting skills of the actors in scientifically handling historical themes.

    正确地反映历史真实的榜样
    ——介绍苏联影片“彼得大帝”
    马少波
    编剧：阿·托尔斯泰、符·彼得洛夫、尼·列施契柯  导演：符·彼得洛夫  翻译：杨范  苏联列宁电影制片厂一九三七年出品  中央电影制片厂译制
    根据阿·托尔斯泰的长篇小说改编的影片“彼得大帝”，在苏联的历史影片中，有着杰出的成就；它在以科学的历史观点，正确地反映历史事实和生动地塑造人物性格方面，也就是说如何运用社会主义现实主义的方法处理历史题材方面，给了我们极其深刻的启示。
    真实是艺术创作的最高原则。在描写历史人物时，必须按照历史的具体环境，对人物的思想行为作具体的分析，给以恰如其分的评价，并在艺术上作到与此相适应的表现。这样的工作，正如恩格斯所说：“即令是唯物论的见解在一个单独的实例上的发展，也是需要数年静心研究的科学工作，因为这很明显，仅仅依靠词句是不行的，只有大量批判地选择过并且完全掌握了的历史材料，才能完成这一任务。”（马克思：“政治经济学批判”）
    彼得之所以伟大，是因为他在当时的历史条件下，出色地体现了俄罗斯民族伟大的精神面貌，以无限坚毅与顽强的魄力，向旧俄罗斯的愚昧、落后、虚伪、卑怯、苟安、腐败（贪欲的贵族、愚蠢的教徒，而彼得的大儿子阿·阿列克谢依就是这些人们的代表）进行斗争，“打开了通向欧洲的窗户”，迎接近代文明。正如列宁所说：“彼得促进了野蛮的俄罗斯对于西方文化的模仿，而且他在对抗野蛮主义的斗争中也不惜采用野蛮的手段。”（见列宁选集第七卷，三六六页。一九三六年，莫斯科版。）彼得坚决地扫除了在他改革道路上的一切障碍，保卫自己的祖国，实现了伟大的历史任务，推动了社会的向前发展。这正是当时俄罗斯人民的愿望。
    十八世纪初叶，俄国的经济、文化和军事，都是落后于西欧各国的。当时，俄国没有通海的出路，走向黑海和波罗的海的出路被闭塞了：黑海是处在土耳其和克里木亚汗国的权力之下，波罗的海沿岸，则被瑞典所占领。在当时，为着取得波罗的海和收复“祖先的土地”的斗争，已经成为俄国资本主义发展的迫切要求。
    影片对此作了充分的描绘。当俄罗斯在危难中时，贵族们却为个人的大小利益争吵不休，教徒们为着教堂的铜钟嘶声号叫，卑怯的皇太子阿列克谢依则为着争夺皇位，诅咒着彼得早死。彼得这时却清醒地知道：俄罗斯在收复波罗的海的战争中，军队由于训练、装备不良，被瑞典王卡尔拉十二的军队击溃了。这给彼得带来的不是灰心和屈服，而是巨大的前进的力量。他说：“战争才开始！”“怎么在那尔伏被打垮了？科学！他们再打五次，波罗的海还是我们的。你马上把卡尔拉王带了来，我一定很感谢地亲着他——谢谢你把我们打败了，你打得我得到教训”。“炮都丢了，去它的吧！都是坏的。制造新的。”
    一七○九年六月俄瑞战争会战的一天，彼得在他的攻击命令中这样说：
    “战士们，决定我们国家命运的就在眼前了。不要以为你们是在为彼得而战，你们是为了付托给彼得的国家而战！为了你们自己的骨肉和祖国而战！不要为号称无敌的敌人的虚名所吓倒，因为你们自己所获得的各次胜利已经一再证明这是骗人的话。至于彼得，他并不惜生命，只要俄罗斯是在为了你们的福利而长存于快乐和荣誉中。”
    为了保卫国土，他决定建立舰队，于是便在伏洛聂目河岸建立起造船厂来。年青的彼得亲自打铁作工，铁工骂他“笨蛋”，他也全不理会，他是理解祖国的尊贵和信赖祖国的力量的。第一个向皇帝献出了自己的钱囊的不是贵族，而是农奴出身的商人勃洛夫金；许多像费杰卡那样的农民，都参加到彼得的军伍中来了。多么动人的场面啊。当选兵入伍时彼得和农民费杰卡较力，彼得被费杰卡拦腰抱起摔到一丈以外的地下时，彼得的反应是出人意外的：他给费倒一杯酒高兴地说：“真不错！”“有这样的人，我们还愁打不过瑞典！”
    影片对于彼得给以应有的肯定，对于他在历史上的功勋加以歌颂；但是历史上的任何英雄都不能不受他们所处的时代条件的一定限制。当斯大林同志论述彼得大帝统治下的俄国特征时，对于当时的贵族阶级和新产生的商人阶级在俄国所起的领导作用，特别是对于彼得是给了精确的评价的。但是斯大林同志也曾明确地深刻地教育我们，如果拿沙皇彼得与列宁相比，那只是“大海中之一滴”。
    影片对于这位贵族皇帝的历史局限性，是给予了正确的表现的。影片深刻地暴露了贵族地主的贪婪和残酷的剥夺，并以同情的笔触描写了农奴们所遭受的灾难和痛苦。特别是通过农民费杰卡所走的道路：“拿刀割断绊脚绳，跑到自由的顿河去！”逐步揭开了贵族地主与农民之间的矛盾。俄国的农民在彼得在位的时期，曾举行了多次轰轰烈烈的农民暴动。
    影片对于彼得本人以及对他身边人物的描写，是真实的，是令人信服的，那就是并不掩盖和粉饰他们性格上行为上的缺陷。“弟兄们，城里有酒和女人，放你们玩一天一夜！”这是他们进军的动员口号，而且也的确曾经上上下下，昏昏然纷纷然闹得不可开交。彼得皇帝曾为酒色陶醉，彼得的亲信大臣缅希柯夫也不免贪污自肥，……所有这些，影片都给真实地描绘出来。这与反历史主义者总是想把古代英雄人物描写成现代的英雄人物，在原则上，是有显然的区别的。
    影片“彼得大帝”中的几个主要人物是描写得非常深刻而富有个性的。尤其是彼得第一（恩·西蒙诺夫饰）、阿列克谢依（恩·契尔卡索夫饰）、叶卡杰陵娜（塔拉索娃饰）、缅希柯夫（姆·查罗夫饰）、费杰卡（符·陀勃罗夫尔斯基饰）等人的形象特别鲜明。鲜明的形象和强有力的性格的创造，不仅要用表现人物本身所具有的特征的方法，而且要藉助于作品的结构，并取决于每个人物的相互关系，以及他们在整个事件中所处的地位。对于彼得和他的儿子阿列克谢依来说，这种智与愚的对照，贤与不肖的对照，杰出与平庸的对照，无疑是有重要的作用的。从影片开头，在彼得要毁钟造炮，而阿列克谢依坚决反对：“俄国的钟声最有名，东罗马的国王都说钟声好听！”就点明了他们父子间品质和志趣的迥不相同。在影片所有的形象中，以彼得和他底儿子对观众的印象为最深。我想这首先是由于作者把这些形象不仅放置在整个结构里，放置在形象的行列中，而且和其他形象发生着密切的关联，而且把当时的主要矛盾、主要人物和主导的思想放在突出的地位。其次，是由于这些人物底内心世界的发掘较深，写得合情合理。一切都是按照生活的实情，把矛盾的曲折性、复杂性如实地表现出来。例如阿列克谢依所走的道路是和彼得背道而驰的，他在顽固保守的贵族们的怀抱里一意夺取皇位。当彼得病危的时候，他强自掩盖着内心的喜悦，在病床前画十字后，退回自己的宫中。他简直欢欣若狂了：“理想实现了！多么快乐呀！要到莫斯科去住，安静舒服地听着幽静的钟声，把船都烧了，彼得堡让瑞典人拿去，讨厌的地方……。父王用的大臣都砍掉他们的脑袋，用我自己的新人……”意外的，他的父王并没有死，于是他跪在彼得的面前装腔作势地说：“父亲，我为你的健康作祈祷……看，我们多么快活。”这位皇太子卑怯平庸，然而他并不甘心寂寞，更不甘心死灭，他想尽一切办法妄图挣扎，他像一条癞狗一样地逃到国外，向罗马教皇请兵，不惜出卖祖国，企图把彼得的皇位取而代之。当他被带回国来，又乖乖地跪在彼得的膝下，诚惶诚恐、痛哭流涕，好像是败子回头，真心忏悔了，实际上却仍在进行着推翻彼得的阴谋活动。这样描写的性格和形象，是异常突出的，尤其是许多入微的刻划。例如当彼得生了第二个儿子，保守的贵族们跑到皇太子的寝宫里团团恳求阿列克谢依来作皇帝，而阿列克谢依却歇斯的里地喊：“滚开！我底头都保不住了，你们还说这样危险的话！”
    （哭泣）他并不是不想作皇帝，但是他胆小，他怕死，这样几句话就细腻地刻划了阿列克谢依的性格。贵族们悄悄地走了之后，阿列克谢依对他的妻发起狠来：“怕，亲爱的，我怕父王怕得很！我要打死他！他常常一个人在彼得堡走，很容易打死他！”“很容易，”为什么没有打死他呢？由于他胆小，他怕死。再如写彼得大帝把俄国的老窗子打开，象征打开通向欧洲的窗户；逼迫大臣和命妇们喝咖啡、戴假发跳舞，剪掉布伊诺夫的长胡子……这些幽默的情节，表现了新与旧的斗争。通过这一政治性的斗争，极其出色地刻划了彼得的性格。他身先士卒，亲自打铁，和费杰卡较力，打缅希柯夫，强迫公爵的儿子到荷兰留学，要是公爵儿子的仆役答得出数学和筑船学就叫仆役当海军军官，让公爵儿子作他的水兵，伪装领港的水手，戏弄罗马教皇的大使……凡此一切无一不是真实地表现了彼得的性格，使得整个画面绚烂多彩。尤其是在他处理儿子叛国罪的整个过程（包括召回、审问、付判、执刑）中，彼得大帝的形象是何等鲜明！彼得在处理破坏者的问题上，是坚决的、严峻的；然而，即使以“暴君”著称的彼得大帝，也是有其细腻的丰富的父子之情的，而这表现得如此真实、合理，如此具有异常的说服力量。
    影片“彼得大帝”对于我们，不仅具有发扬历史优秀传统，鼓舞爱国精神的教育作用，而且在科学地处理历史题材的创作方法、导演方法和演员们的表演艺术方面，也给我们提供了成功的典范。（附图片）
