In this year's spring fishing season, Shandong and Zhejiang coastal areas have experienced bumper harvests and increased production. Liaodong, Jiangsu, Fujian, and Hebei are expected to complete their original plans. Only Liaoxi and Guangdong have experienced reduced production due to bad weather.

Shandong's cod, prawns, and small yellow croaker production have all increased this year. Yantai harvested a total of three million jin of cod, exceeding the total amount of the past three years since liberation by 34%. In Yantai, over 220,000 jin of prawns were brought to market in a single day, more than five times the production of last year. Schools of small yellow croaker were very dense, with a single net-casting boat able to catch 20,000 to 30,000 jin. After the large yellow croaker and Chinese herring fishing season began, the coast of Rongcheng County in the Wendeng Special District went to sea five to ten days earlier. On May 7th, Shidao alone harvested 210,000 jin of Chinese herring, and on May 8th, Lidao in Rongcheng County also harvested over 200,000 jin. From January to April, Zhejiang produced more than 210,000 dan of small yellow croaker. The large yellow croaker season began in early May, and by mid-June, 180,000 dan had been produced in Maotou Ocean and 120,000 dan in Damu Ocean, experiencing a widespread bumper harvest that exceeded the planned targets. As a result, the containers originally prepared by fishermen were insufficient, and they had to borrow all available jars and barrels from various villages to barely solve the problem. During Fujian's spring fishing season, increased production was seen in Pingtan, Sansha, Huangqi, and other places. Pingtan recorded a new high in decades with a single high tide catch of 14,000 dan. Production decreased in Xiamen, Hui'an, and other places. However, fishermen in Fujian showed great enthusiasm for shark fishing this year, catching more than a dozen sharks weighing over 1,000 jin, significantly increasing the supply of fish liver oil. Guangdong experienced bad weather this spring, reducing the number of fishing trips and leading to a general reduction in production. However, in March, four large whales weighing over 1,000 jin each were caught near Hai'an on the Leizhou Peninsula, a welcome harvest during the spring fishing season.

State-owned enterprises generally approached the completion of their planned production tasks during the spring fishing season. In the first quarter, the Shanghai Aquatic Products Company only completed 74.46% of its planned production due to untimely vessel repairs and reduced fishing trips. The Yantai office only completed 49.8% of its plan. However, after improving the fishing situation in April, the Shanghai Aquatic Products Company exceeded its April planned production by 18.25%, and the Yantai office exceeded it by 42%. The Shandong Aquatic Products Company completed 91.14% of its plan in the first quarter and 85.45% in April. The Ludong Aquatic Products Company completed 95.14% of its plan in the first quarter and exceeded it by 2.15% in April. Shandong Transportation and Marketing Company's fishing boats No. 17 and 18 caught 4,500 boxes of fish in less than a week, breaking the past fishing record.

Preparations for this year's spring fishing season were relatively timely, especially in Shandong and Zhejiang provinces, where fishing loans were distributed in a timely manner. Shipbuilding, repair, and fishing gear preparation in major fishing areas were completed before the spring fishing season. Many new fishing boats were built in Rushan, Haiyang, and other counties in Shandong, as well as in Shidao. Zhejiang increased the number of boats participating in the large and small yellow croaker fishing season by 7% compared to last year. Fishery supply and marketing cooperatives and grain companies in Zhejiang Province entered into grain supply contracts. Shandong Province's Provincial Fisheries Cooperative Federation implemented preferential measures to ensure the supply of production and living materials for fishermen.

This year, the leadership organizations for fishery production in various provinces have generally been strengthened. Hebei Province established a Marine Products Working Committee in the Tangshan Special District. Coastal areas of Shandong generally established port and market working committees. In addition to coastal special districts and counties organizing production command headquarters to strengthen unified leadership over offshore production, Zhejiang also established the Provincial Spring Fishing Season Production and Marketing Committee in Shenjiamen, Dinghai, to uniformly direct provincial production and marketing work. Fujian established aquatic product work stations in Fu'an, Minhou, Longxi, and Jinjiang, and working groups in 21 other counties, protecting maritime safety, fighting maritime bandits, and persisting in production, which played a significant role. Shandong Province drew on the experience of organizing fish vendors to promote fresh fish in rural areas last year and strengthened this work this year, helping to promote the sale of fish products.

Fish prices in various producing areas across the country are relatively stable, generally maintaining above 1,000 yuan per jin. In Zhoushan, Zhejiang, where fish prices are most prone to fluctuations, a detailed production cost survey was conducted in advance, calculating the minimum price that could protect the fishermen's production costs, general wages, and production investment profits, and stipulating that the minimum fish price could only be exercised during the peak fishing season. In fact, the average price of yellow croaker in Zhoushan in March and April was more than double the stipulated minimum fish price, which made the fishermen feel satisfied and greatly increased their enthusiasm for production.

Several problems also occurred during this year's spring fishing season.

In terms of prices: Although fish prices in Zhejiang's producing areas were good this year, the price difference between producing areas and selling areas was still significant. For example, in March, small yellow croaker in Zhoushan sold for 1,200 yuan per jin, while it sold for 2,400 yuan in Ningbo and 2,500 yuan in Shanghai. In April, large yellow croaker in producing areas sold for 2,200 yuan per jin, while it sold for 3,400 yuan in Ningbo and 4,300 yuan in Shanghai. Therefore, fishermen rushed to produce and sell on their own too early, delaying the valuable production season to some extent. In the future, reasonable fish prices in both producing and selling areas should be controlled, and fishermen should be educated to recognize the losses caused by delaying production to eliminate this unreasonable phenomenon.

Although there have been some improvements in the loan work this year, there are still many problems. For example, after Huangxian Sangdao in Shandong issued 30 million yuan in loans in the first quarter, the bank stated that the loans were not used to purchase advanced fishing gear, which was not in line with the policy, and forced 56 fishing households to repay the loans within a time limit, preventing the fishermen from going to sea on time. The Wusong Town of Shanghai issued loans through cooperatives, with a tendency towards equal distribution, and some fishermen received far more capital than was necessary for production, resulting in some fishermen diverting the fishing loans to other uses. There are too many tax items levied on fishery products in various places, with many unreasonable phenomena, which should be appropriately changed in accordance with the principle of being conducive to production.

The organization of fishery production cooperatives in various places is not yet stable. Generally, the public accumulation fund is too high, affecting the income of fishermen. Some members of fishery production cooperatives have already requested to withdraw from the cooperative as a result. This kind of rash advance should be corrected in a prudent manner.

The lives of fishermen in Guangdong, where the harvest was poor during the spring fishing season, are more difficult than in the past few years. The Central and Guangdong Provincial People's Governments have allocated funds for relief. All areas with poor harvests should mobilize the masses to engage in production for self-salvation, specifically help fishermen solve various difficulties, stabilize production order, relieve fishermen's concerns, spend the off-season stably, prepare for the next season's production, and strive to increase production and make up for losses in the autumn fishing season.

    今年上半年山东浙江沿海鱼产丰收
    沿海各地应帮助渔民做好准备工作，争取秋汛捕鱼的更大胜利
    在今年春汛中，山东、浙江沿海的渔产都丰收而且增产了，辽东、江苏、福建、河北可完成原定计划，只有辽西和广东因为天气不好而减产了。
    山东今年鳕鱼、对虾、小黄鱼都增产了，鳕鱼在烟台共得三百万斤，比解放后三年来的总数还多百分之三十四。对虾在烟台一天登市二十二万多斤，比去年增产五倍多，小黄鱼鱼群很密，挂网船一船能得二万至三万斤。大黄鱼鳓鱼鱼汛开始后，文登专区荣成县沿岸，都提早五天至十天出海，石岛五月七日一天就收鳓鱼二十一万斤，荣成县俚岛五月八日亦收鱼二十余万斤。一月至四月，浙江产小黄鱼二十一万多担。大黄鱼汛从五月初开始，到六月中毛头洋已产十八万担，大目洋已产十二万担，普遍丰收，都超出了预定计划。以致各地渔民原来准备许多容器仍然不够用，临时从各乡村借用了一切可以容鱼的缸桶，才勉强解决了这个困难问题。福建春汛，增产的有平潭、三沙、黄岐等地，平潭有一大潮捕鱼一万四千担的，创造数十年来的新纪录；减产的有厦门、惠安等地。但今年渔民捕鲨鱼情绪很高，捕得千斤以上的有十几条，鱼肝油原料显著增加。广东今春天气不好，渔船出海次数减少，普遍减产；惟在三月间雷州半岛的海安附近，捕得千斤以上的大鲸鱼四条，是春汛中的可喜的收获。
    国营企业在春汛中一般都接近完成预定的生产任务。第一季度，上海水产公司由于船只修理不及时，出海次数减少，只完成计划产量百分之七十四点四六，烟台办事处只完成计划百分之四十九点八。但到了四月份改善了出海情况之后，上海水产公司超额完成了四月份计划产量百分之十八点二五，烟台办事处也超额完成了百分之四十二。山东水产公司第一季度完成计划百分之九十一点一四，四月份完成百分之八十五点四五。旅大水产公司在第一季度完成计划百分之九十五点一四，四月份超额完成百分之二点一五。山东运销公司的十七、十八号渔轮，不到一周获鱼四千五百箱，突破了过去捕鱼的纪录。
    今年春汛中的准备工作比较及时，特别是山东、浙江两省，及时地发放了渔贷，主要渔区的造船修船及整理渔具工作，都能在春汛前完成。山东乳山、海阳等县和石岛都添造了不少新的渔船。浙江今年参加大小黄鱼汛的船只比去年增加了百分之七。浙江省各渔业供销合作社和粮食公司订立了粮食供应合同。山东省全省渔业合作联营社实行优待办法，保证渔民生产资料和生活资料的供应。
    今年各省春汛中，渔业生产领导机构一般都加强了。河北省在唐山专区设立了海产工作委员会。山东沿海普遍成立了海港及海市工作委员会。浙江除沿海各专署、县组织生产指挥部，加强洋面生产的统一领导以外，又在定海沈家门成立全省春汛渔业产销委员会，统一指挥全省产销工作。福建在福安、闽侯、龙溪、晋江四区设水产工作站，另有二十一县设工作组，保卫海上安全，一面与海上残匪作斗争，一面坚持生产，起了很大作用。山东省吸取去年组织鱼贩向农村推销鲜鱼的经验，今年又加强了这个工作，帮助了鱼货的推销。
    全国各产地的鱼价都相当平稳，一般都保持在每斤千元以上。浙江在最易发生鱼价波动的舟山一带，事先曾详细地做了生产成本调查，算出了可以保住渔民生产成本、一般工资及生产投资利润的最低价格，并规定只在最旺鱼汛才可以行使最低鱼价。实际上舟山三四月份黄鱼最旺时平均价都比规定的最低鱼价高一倍以上，渔民都感到满意，生产积极性很高。
    在今年春汛中也发生了若干问题。
    在价格方面：浙江今年产地鱼价虽好，但产地与销地价格还是相差甚远。例如三月份舟山小黄鱼每斤售一千二百元，而宁波售二千四百元，上海售二千五百元，四月份产地大黄鱼每斤售二千二百元，宁波售三千四百元，上海售四千三百元，因此，渔民纷纷过早地自产自销，在一定程度上延误了可贵的生产季节。今后应当掌握产销两地的合理鱼价，并教育渔民认识延误生产的损失，消除这种不合理的现象。
    贷款工作今年虽有些改进，但问题还多。如山东黄县桑岛第一季度贷出了三千万元以后，银行方面说贷款不是用在购置进步渔具上，不合政策，向五十六户渔民挨户限期逼还，弄得渔民不能按时出海。上海市吴淞镇通过合作社发放贷款，有平均分配的偏向，有的远超过了生产所必需的资金，结果有的渔民把渔贷移作别用。各地征收渔产品的税款项目过繁，有许多不合理的现象，这些都应当在有利于生产的原则下予以适当改变。
    各地渔业生产合作社的组织还不稳固，一般的公积金过高，影响渔民的收入，有的渔业生产合作社的社员已因此提出退社的要求。对这种冒进现象应当用稳妥的办法予以纠正。
    在春汛中收获不好的广东省渔民的生活困难，比过去几年严重。中央和广东省人民政府都已拨款救济。各个歉产地区，都应当发动群众生产自救，具体帮助渔民解决各种困难，安定生产秩序，解除渔民顾虑，安定地度过淡汛，做好下一季生产的准备工作，争取在秋汛，增加生产，弥补损失。
