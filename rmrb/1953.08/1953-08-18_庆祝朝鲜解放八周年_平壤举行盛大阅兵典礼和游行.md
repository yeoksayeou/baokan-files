Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th - To celebrate the eighth anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation of Korea, the democratic capital of Korea, Pyongyang, held a grand military parade and mass demonstration on the 15th. The troops reviewed included units from all branches of the Korean People's Army that had been awarded the title of "Guards Unit," and more than 140,000 working people from the Pyongyang area participated in the demonstration. The military parade and mass demonstration lasted for a total of three and a half hours.

The heroic city of Pyongyang, which has been tested by war, was already decked out in festive attire before "August 15th." On the 15th, just as dawn broke, solemn and majestic melodies such as "The Patriotic Song," "The Song of General Kim Il Sung," and "The East is Red" were broadcast from loudspeakers on the streets. The dawn broke through the morning mist that lingered over the Daedong River, and the rosy glow of dawn draped the "Liberation Monument" on Moranbong Hill in golden-red colors. A day of jubilation began. Troops with neat military bearing and columns of workers, peasants, women, youths, students, and office workers converged on the city center from all directions in orderly fashion and entered the venue. Tanks, anti-aircraft guns, armored vehicles...standing tall on the streets facing the reviewing stand, were all poised to be reviewed, demonstrating their growing strength in the anti-aggression war and their increasing strength with each battle.

The reviewing stand stood solemnly in the central square. The front of the stand was adorned with the national emblem of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and giant portraits of Lenin, Stalin, Kim Il Sung, Malenkov, and Mao Zedong, with the flags of Korea, the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries flying above. Four grandstands were arranged on either side. On the grandstands were responsible cadres from Korean party and government organs, model heroes from the labor front, generals of the Korean People's Army, and delegations from all over the country, as well as staff from the embassies and other organizations of fraternal countries stationed in Korea. The delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers, led by General Li Zhimin, was invited to attend the ceremony and was warmly welcomed.

At precisely 10:00 a.m., when the leaders of the Korean party, government, and military, headed by Marshal Kim Il Sung, ascended the reviewing stand, the People's Army troops lined up in the square and the masses around the square enthusiastically cheered and applauded.

Vice Marshal Choi Yong-kun, Minister of National Defense of Korea and commander of the parade, and General Kim Kwang-hyup, Chief of General Staff of the People's Army and commander of the parade, reviewed the troops of the People's Army in their respective inspection vehicles. Afterwards, Vice Marshal Choi Yong-kun delivered a congratulatory speech to all the officers and soldiers of the People's Army. He recounted the great contributions of the Soviet army in liberating Korea, the enormous assistance given to the Korean people by the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries, and the brilliant victories achieved by the Korean People's Army in its cooperative battles with the Chinese People's Volunteers. He called on the officers and soldiers of the People's Army to bear in mind the instructions of Marshal Kim Il Sung, continue to maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, and further improve their combat effectiveness to prevent the enemy from trampling on peace again. He also called on the officers and soldiers of the People's Army to actively participate in the cause of restoring and building the post-war people's economy.

The troops being reviewed responded to Vice Marshal Choi Yong-kun's call with enthusiastic cheers. Subsequently, gun salutes, military bugles, and military music sounded one after another. The troops began to march towards the reviewing stand, and the parade began. Leading the way was the hero squad composed of "Republic Heroes." On their chests, they all wore brilliant medals and awards that displayed their outstanding military achievements. Following them were the officer squad composed of officers from the General Staff of the People's Army, as well as military school cadets from various branches of the armed forces, as well as male and female students from the Revolutionary Martyrs' Children's Academy and the Military Medical School. The infantry troops of the People's Army, as well as mechanized units and artillery units, followed in a majestic procession. On many of the anti-aircraft guns in the imposing ranks of the artillery units were painted white five-pointed stars, the glorious symbols of having shot down large numbers of enemy aircraft.

Amidst the warm applause and cheers of the people, the tank units entered the square. At the same time, formations of various aircraft led by the heroes of the Korean People's Air Force thundered across the sky above the square. First to fly past was the aircraft piloted by Tae Sun-hui, Korea's first female air force hero.

The people of Pyongyang, who suffered severe damage from enemy aircraft during the war, continuously welcomed their soldiers with thunderous cheers and applause. They felt extremely excited and delighted by the rapid growth and strengthening of the People's Army.

After the parade ceremony concluded, the demonstration began. The workers, peasants, students, office workers, and citizens of Pyongyang, filled with boundless excitement, wore festive attire and participated in the parade, holding high the flags of Korea, the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, as well as portraits of Kim Il Sung, Malenkov, and Mao Zedong. Female students wearing floral crowns and holding bouquets danced Korean folk dances to the rhythm of the music as they marched forward with the parade. As the parade passed the reviewing stand and the grandstands, they enthusiastically cheered and paid their respects to Marshal Kim Il Sung and the soldiers of the Korean and Chinese people's armies. Two Young Pioneers ran up to the reviewing stand with large bouquets of鲜花鲜花 to present to Marshal Kim Il Sung, eliciting enduring applause from the entire audience. Male and female workers, led by railway workers, presented wreaths to the heroes of the Korean and Chinese people's armies.

The most eye-catching in the mass parade were the long lines of workers and peasants. They marched forward in high spirits, holding up placards with slogans such as "Everything for strengthening the democratic base and restoring and developing the post-war people's economy," and displaying various charts demonstrating the active restoration of production, as well as the reconstruction design of Pyongyang and the model of the reconstructed Pyongyang.

The demonstration showed the Korean people's boundless love and support for the Party, the government, and the Korean and Chinese people's armies, and demonstrated the Korean people's powerful strength and firm determination to restore and develop the post-war people's economy. The parade did not end until 1:30 p.m.

    【新华社平壤十七日电】为了庆祝“八·一五”朝鲜解放八周年，朝鲜民主首都平壤在十五日举行了盛大的阅兵典礼和群众示威游行。受检阅的有荣膺“近卫部队”称号的朝鲜人民军各兵种部队，参加示威游行的有平壤地区的劳动人民十四万多人。阅兵典礼和群众示威游行共历时三小时半。
    饱经战争考验的英雄城平壤，在“八·一五”前夕就已经披上了节日的盛装。十五日，天刚黎明，街头播音机里就传送出“爱国歌”、“金日成将军之歌”、“东方红”等庄严、雄壮的旋律。曙光冲破了弥漫在大同江上的晨雾，早霞给牡丹峰上的“解放纪念塔”披上了金红色的晨装。欢腾的一天开始了。从四面八方向市中心区集中的军容严整的部队和工人、农民、妇女、青年、学生、职员的行列陆续进入会场，秩序井然。面向检阅台伫立在街道上的坦克、高射炮、装甲车……都以雄伟的姿态，准备着接受检阅，显示自己在反侵略战争中成长壮大、愈战愈强的力量。
    检阅台庄严地矗立在中央广场上。台的正面挂着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国徽和列宁、斯大林、金日成、马林科夫、毛泽东的巨幅画像，上方插着朝、苏、中三国及各人民民主国家的国旗。两旁分排着四个观礼台。在观礼台上有朝鲜党政机关的负责干部，劳动战线上的英雄模范，朝鲜人民军将领和来自全国各地的观礼代表团及各兄弟国家驻朝使节和使馆等机关的人员。中国人民志愿军的代表团在李志民将军率领下应邀参加观礼，受到了热烈的欢迎。
    上午十时正，当以金日成元帅为首的朝鲜党政军首长登上检阅台时，排列在广场上的人民军部队和广场四周的群众，都热烈地欢呼、鼓掌。
    朝鲜民族保卫相、阅兵司令官崔庸健次帅和阅兵指挥官、人民军总参谋长金光侠大将，分别乘着检阅车检阅了人民军各兵种部队。接着崔庸健次帅向人民军全体将士作了祝贺演说。他叙述了苏联军队解放朝鲜的伟大功勋，苏联、中国和各兄弟国家人民给予朝鲜人民的巨大援助，以及朝鲜人民军在中国人民志愿军的配合作战下所取得的辉煌胜利。他号召人民军将士们牢记金日成元帅的指示，继续保持高度的革命警惕性，进一步提高战斗力，防止敌人再度蹂躏和平。他并号召人民军将士们积极参加恢复和建设战后人民经济的事业。
    受检阅的部队以热烈的欢呼回答了崔庸健次帅的号召。随着，先后响起了礼炮军号和军乐声。部队开始走向检阅台，阅兵式开始。走在最前面的，是由“共和国英雄”们组成的英雄中队。他们的胸前都佩带着显示他们卓著战功的灿烂辉煌的勋章和奖章。接着通过的是，由人民军总参谋部军官组成的军官中队，和各兵种的军事学校学员以及革命烈士子女学院和军医学校的男女学生们。人民军的步兵部队以及机械化部队和炮兵部队，雄赳赳地随后行进。炮兵部队的威武行列中有许多高射炮的炮筒上都漆满了白色的五角星，那是击落大批敌机的光荣标志。
    在人们热烈的掌声和欢呼声中，坦克部队进入广场，同时，人民军空军英雄们率领的各种飞机编队带着隆隆的巨响掠过广场的上空。首先飞过的是朝鲜第一个女空军英雄太善姬驾驶的飞机。
    战时遭受敌机严重破坏的平壤市人民，不断地以雷动的欢呼和掌声，欢迎自己的子弟兵。他们对人民军的迅速成长和壮大感到无比的兴奋和喜悦。
    阅兵典礼结束以后，开始示威游行。平壤市的工人、农民、学生、职员和市民，都怀着无限的兴奋，穿着节日的盛装，高举着朝、苏、中三国及各人民民主国家的国旗和金日成、马林科夫、毛泽东的画像参加游行。戴着花冠拿着花束的女学生们，随着音乐的节奏跳着朝鲜的民族舞蹈，随着游行队伍一齐前进。游行队伍在经过检阅台和观礼台前面时，都热烈地向金日成元帅，向朝中人民军队的将士们欢呼致敬。两个少年团员捧着大束鲜花，跑上检阅台向金日成元帅献花，引起了全场经久不息的掌声。以铁路工人为首的男女工人们向朝中人民军队的英雄们献赠了花环。
    群众游行队伍中最引人注目的，是工人和农民的长列队伍。他们高举着“一切为了加强民主基地，恢复和发展战后人民经济”的标语牌，表示要积极恢复生产的各种图表及平壤市的重建设计图、重建后的平壤市的模型等，兴高采烈地行进。
    示威游行表明了朝鲜人民对党、政府和朝中人民军队的无限热爱和拥护，并显示了朝鲜人民恢复和发展战后人民经济的雄厚力量与坚强决心。游行到下午一时半方告结束。
