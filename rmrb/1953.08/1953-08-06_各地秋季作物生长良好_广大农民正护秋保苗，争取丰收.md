Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Autumn crops are growing well in various regions, and the broad masses of farmers are actively preventing and controlling various diseases and insect pests, weeding and fertilizing, and building farmland water conservancy projects to strive for a bumper autumn harvest. In East China, drought-resistant and mountain miscellaneous grain crops, accounting for about 50% of the region's total grain crop area, are growing well. Currently, sorghum in Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong provinces has generally tasseled and is setting seeds, and will soon begin to be harvested successively; spring corn is approaching maturity, and early corn in northern Jiangsu Province has already entered the market. Millet in Shandong and Anhui provinces has generally reached the heading stage, and early millet can be harvested soon. Late autumn crops such as soybeans and mung beans in the areas north of the Huai River in Anhui Province and Jiangsu and Shandong provinces are mostly growing vigorously, and early-planted sweet potatoes have extended stems more than two feet long. Huian County in Fujian Province, known as the "Sweet Potato County," also has very good sweet potato growth this year.

    In Central and South China, autumn rice is growing well in most parts of Henan Province, and a bumper harvest is expected. Early autumn crops such as sorghum and millet in the province have fully headed and are now filling. Better millet has grown as tall as a person, with panicles as long as seven or eight inches; corn is generally five or six feet tall and is tasseling; cotton has also begun to produce bolls. Various late autumn crops are also growing well, with beans two feet tall and flowering and bearing pods. Farmers in various places report that this year's autumn rice is unprecedented in many years. Judging from the current situation, it is estimated that autumn crops throughout the province will generally have a bumper harvest. Mengjin County, south of the Yellow River, estimates that this autumn's production will increase by 20% to 30% compared to the "bumper harvest year" of autumn 1951; Lushan County at the foot of the Funiu Mountains also estimates an increase of 15% compared to 1951.

    In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, more than one million hectares (15 mu per hectare) of autumn crops in agricultural areas are growing well. Sorghum and corn along the fertile Liaohe and Xinkai rivers are already six or seven feet tall, and the corn has tasseled and formed cobs. Soybeans, the main cash crop here, are also more than a foot tall. In the eastern Ke'erqin Right Wing Front Banner area, which has always been relatively arid, various crops are also growing better than in previous years. According to the current growth of sorghum, corn, and millet in Juliken Nutuk of the Banner, it is estimated that each hectare will produce about 1,000 catties more grain than last year.

    Currently, farmers in various regions are protecting autumn crops and seedlings. After the emergence of rice seedlings in East China, farmers in various regions actively prevent and control various diseases and insect pests, and weed and fertilize. At present, sorghum and corn have been weeded four times in most areas, soybeans and mung beans have also been weeded once, and sweet potatoes are starting to be turned over. In rice-growing areas of Jiangsu Province, elderly farmers' forums or technical exchange meetings are generally held to promote advanced experience such as shallow water frequent irrigation, timely water release, and prevention of lodging, in order to strive for a bumper harvest of mid-season and late-season rice. After the summer harvest this year, farmers in various parts of Jiangsu Province actively participated in the construction of large and small water conservancy projects, combining production with water conservancy construction, to strive for increased grain and cotton production in the autumn. In Henan Province, Central and South China, early autumn crops have matured in a few areas, and farmers are starting to harvest; farmers in most areas are managing autumn fields with greater efforts and preparing to overcome all possible disasters to strive for the complete realization of a bumper harvest. In Northwest China, many rice paddies in Ningxia Province have been weeded two to three times. Farmers in Qinghai Province are changing the past phenomenon of "tight in spring and loose in summer," and immediately plow and harrow the harvested summer fields to conserve soil moisture. The more than ten million mu of wheat stubble land in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province has generally been plowed once and is now undergoing a second plowing and harrowing.

    各地秋季作物生长良好
    广大农民正护秋保苗，争取丰收
    据新华社讯：各地秋季作物生长良好，广大农民正积极防治各种病虫害和锄草施肥，兴修农田水利，争取秋季丰收。华东区占全区粮食作物总面积百分之五十左右的旱地和山区的杂粮作物生长良好。目前，江苏、安徽、山东三省的高粱已普遍抽穗结实，即将陆续开始收割；春玉米已接近成熟，江苏省北部地区的早玉米并已登场上市。山东、安徽两省的谷子已普遍齐穗，早谷在最近就可开始收割。安徽省淮河以北地区和江苏、山东两省的大豆、绿豆等晚秋作物大都生长茁壮，早栽的甘薯已伸出二尺多长的茎藤。福建省素称“甘薯县”的惠安县，今年甘薯生长也很好。
    在中南区，河南省大部地区秋禾生长良好，丰收在望。全省早秋作物高粱、谷子穗已出齐，现正在灌浆。谷子较好的已长得和人一样高，穗子足有七、八寸长；玉米一般都有五、六尺高，正在出梢；棉花也已开始结桃。各种晚秋作物也长得很好，豆子已有二尺高，正开花结角。各地农民反映：今年秋禾是多年来所没有见过的。从目前情况来看，预计全省秋季作物将普遍丰收。黄河南岸的孟津县估计今秋可比一九五一年秋季“丰产年”增产二三成；伏牛山麓的鲁山县估计也可比一九五一年增产一成半。
    在内蒙古自治区，农业地区一百多万垧（每垧十五市亩）秋季作物生长良好。土地肥沃的辽河和新开河两岸的高粱、玉蜀黍已有六七尺高，玉蜀黍已吐缨结棒。这里所出产的主要经济作物大豆也长有一尺多高。在一向比较干旱的东部区科尔沁右翼前旗一带，各种作物也都比往年长得好。根据该旗巨力很努图克高粱、玉蜀黍、谷子等作物目前生长的情况，估计每垧地比去年要多打粮食一千斤左右。
    目前，各地农民正在护秋保苗。华东区各地禾苗出土后，各地农民积极防治各种病虫害和锄草、施肥。现在，各地高粱、玉米已大部锄完四遍，大豆、绿豆也锄完了头遍，甘薯正开始翻藤。江苏省稻作地区，普遍召开老年农民座谈会或技术交流会，推广浅水勤灌、适时放水、防止倒伏等先进经验，争取中稻、晚稻丰收。今年夏收后，江苏各地农民在生产和兴修水利相结合的条件下，踊跃地参加了修建大小水利工程，争取秋季粮、棉增产。在中南区河南省，目前，少数地区的早秋作物已经成熟，农民正开始收割；大部地区的农民正以更大的努力管理秋田，并准备战胜一切可能发生的灾害，争取丰收的彻底实现。在西北区，宁夏省许多稻田已薅草两遍到三遍。青海省农民改变过去“春紧夏松”的现象，收割过的夏田即时犁、耱，使能保墒。陕西省关中地区的一千多万亩麦槎地已普遍犁过一次，现正进行第二次犁、耱。
