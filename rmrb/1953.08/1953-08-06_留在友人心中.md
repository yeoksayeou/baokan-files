    Remaining in the Hearts of Friends
    Li He
    "Life has begun, the era is advancing, there's no end to writing about everything seen, and unforgettable is everything heard. Respect to Mao Zedong!" - This is what a Soviet man, Karnov, left behind after visiting the "People's Republic of China Industry and Agriculture Exhibition."
    The "People's Republic of China Industry and Agriculture Exhibition," which opened in Moscow on July 11th, closed on August 4th amidst the Soviet friends' feelings of reluctance. A total of 550,000 working people visited the exhibition. Many people requested that it be extended for another month or two and be exhibited in other cities in the Soviet Union, but after being extended for five days from July 31st, the exhibition now has to go to Leipzig to participate in the International Fair. During the twenty-five days from July 11th to August 4th, the exhibition hall in Gorky Central Culture and Rest Park was crowded with audiences of men, women, old, and young every day. They came to visit with eager hearts, hoping to know more and understand more about the fruits of labor of their good friend, the Chinese people. During the visit, they were moved to see the achievements of the new China with their own eyes. The exhibits on display at the exhibition enhanced understanding between close friends. The visitors generally felt that it was a matter of pride to have friends like the Chinese people. The good impression reflected by the exhibition of the beginning of the development of the new China's national economy has been deeply imprinted in the hearts of friends.
    The people who visited the exhibition came from various districts of Moscow and from all over the Soviet Union - from Central Asia to the Far North, from the Far East to the Baltic coast. They were workers, technicians, engineers, collective farmers, soldiers, officers, students, teachers, staff, social workers, government ministers, painters, writers, doctors, housewives, and people of all kinds of professions. A disabled person who lost both legs in the Great Patriotic War drove a small car to visit. A teacher from a secondary technical school, 160 kilometers from Moscow, after visiting the exhibition, went back to summon the students who were already on summer vacation to come and see it. Many people came to see it twice. A female textile worker from Vladimir watched it three times in a row. Quite a few people looked carefully for several hours. After queuing up and sweating in the summer heat, people left seven thousand sincere feelings overflowing from their hearts, both individually and collectively. These feelings were fully written in more than fifty opinion books.
    Simple words are permeated with deep friendship. Engineers, technicians, and workers from the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory wrote with emotion: "We deeply admire the great achievements made by the Chinese people in such a short period after liberation. Your achievements encourage us to victoriously complete the task of technically assisting the People's China. In order to consolidate the permanent friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, we will spare no effort to work hard." Popova, Chairman of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, left a message saying: "The brilliant exhibition is clear proof of the heroic labor of the free Chinese people who are building a new life, and a vivid expression of the sincere friendship between the great people of China and the Soviet Union. I wish you, dear friends, to achieve more new achievements! May the indestructible and permanent friendship between our two peoples be further enhanced and developed."
    A group of people from Lenin's hometown sincerely wrote: "We are from Lenin's hometown - Ulyanovsk. Let us offer our respect to the great Chinese people from both sides of the mighty Volga River."
    One person who came from the construction site of the world's largest hydropower station - the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station - left a lingering feeling: "How reluctant I am to leave the exhibition! A warm love for the Chinese people is burning in my heart. Everything is excellent, beautiful, and true. Truly, the Chinese people will live a very happy life. I sincerely wish Mao Zedong good health. My heart is filled with a feeling of pride for the Chinese people."
    Dalkov, a former worker and now an engineer, came to visit with his three-year-old son, Seryosha. Seryosha praised the Chinese students who patiently explained to the audience at the exhibition, saying, "Chinese uncle is good"; Dalkov wrote down his feelings, saying: "First of all, I hope - even if it's just imagination - to embrace all the Chinese people, the great people of the new China, the Chinese people whom we love, whom we sympathize with, and whom we trust." A mother who once dedicated all her sons to the motherland visited the exhibition after the signing of the Korean armistice agreement. After the visit, she wrote: "On the day of the Korean armistice, we share your joy and rejoice together. Your victory is the victory of the progressive mankind of the world."
    Soviet friends' interest in the exhibition is broad and multifaceted. People praised China's resources, saying: "China, which possesses such abundant resources, will surely become a more powerful country after construction." Anshan Iron and Steel's steel, Fushun's coal, huge water conservancy projects, self-made machine tools, as well as the skilled operations of model lathe worker Ma Minghe, spinning worker Zhuang Genying, and weaver Sun Yurong at the exhibition - all of this made people feel surprised and delighted by the rapid progress of Chinese industry. Bushuyev, a famous high-speed cutting lathe worker from the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory who had been to China, exchanged experiences with Ma Minghe on the spot during the visit. Bobrov, a Stalin Prize winner from the Moscow Tool Manufacturing Plant, discovered that the ventilation equipment of the exhibition machine was prone to heating up, so he told his Chinese friends about the ventilation equipment he invented. When Soviet railway staff saw that the mileage of Chinese railways increased from more than 6,800 kilometers in 1947 to more than 24,300 kilometers in 1952, they said: "What a fast speed!" People meticulously inquired about the growth, composition, and uses of agricultural products such as tea, sorghum, and oils from the commentators. A Georgian agronomist inquired about the cultivation method of tung trees. A doctor of agricultural science wrote: "What particularly pleased me was the glorious victory of Chinese farmers - China, in three years, has changed from an importer of grains and industrial crops to a country capable of exporting rice to India and Ceylon." People particularly liked and appreciated the wisdom and talent of Chinese workers manifested in light industry and handicraft products. In front of the two large embroidery paintings of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in the Kremlin and the meeting of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong, large groups of visitors often stood. They repeatedly inquired about the makers and the time and method of making them, and expressed great respect to the embroidery girls. Silk fabrics and textiles, embroidery, ivory carvings, and handicrafts are also very popular. Many textile workers came to watch carefully. A woman once asked for permission to copy embroidery patterns. People wrote their feelings, saying: "Lovely people, strange hands, wonderful works", "It's really hard to imagine that people can make such exquisite works of art, which shows the high skill, artistic style and love of labor of the Chinese people." The restaurant at the exhibition was crowded with customers every day. Here, people ate Chinese dishes such as roast duck and crispy chicken cooked by famous Chinese chefs, and tasted Chinese black tea, green tea, scented tea, and black tea. Although they waited in line for a long time, they were all happy to be able to taste what they considered to be the best food and tea in the world. Some people also hope that Chinese chefs and Soviet chefs will exchange experiences. Although the exhibition has a special Sino-Soviet Friendship Department, the visitors believe that all the exhibition sections are full of the close friendship between China and the Soviet Union.
    During the exhibition, more than ten newspapers in Moscow and various parts of the Soviet Union published their own reports on the exhibition. The public opinion and the audience are consistent. A report recently published in the "Izvestia" entitled "The Fruits of Constructive Labor" can be regarded as a representative. The report said: "The achievements made by Chinese comrades in three and a half years cannot but make us - the Soviets happy. Here, beside these numerous exhibits that so warmly commemorate the victory of the peaceful labor of the great people - neighbors and friends - who are so kind to us, we seem to relive our youthful days, the youthful days of the socialist country. Today's Soviet Union is tomorrow's China. The Moscow exhibition clearly proves how quickly the Chinese people are approaching their tomorrow."

    留在友人心中
    李何
    “生活开始了，时代前进了，写不完看到的一切，忘不了听到的一切，向毛泽东致敬！”——这是一个苏联人卡尔诺夫在参观了“中华人民共和国工农业展览会”后留下的话。
    七月十一日在莫斯科开幕的“中华人民共和国工农业展览会”，已在八月四日在苏联友人惜别的心情中闭幕了。总共有五十五万劳动人民参观了展览会。许多人要求多展览一两个月和到苏联其他城市去展览，但展览会从七月三十一日起延展了五天后，现在必须去来比锡参加国际博览会了。从七月十一日到八月四日的二十五天中，高尔基中央文化休憩公园的展览馆，每天都拥挤着男女老幼的观众，他们怀着渴望的心情前来参观，希望多知道、多了解自己的好朋友——中国人民的劳动的果实。他们在参观中感动地亲眼看到了新中国的成就。展览会上陈列的展览品增进了知己之间的了解。参观的人普遍感到有中国人民这样的朋友是值得自豪的。展览会所反映的新中国国民经济开始发展的良好印象，已经深深地留在友人的心中。
    参观展览会的人们来自莫斯科各区，来自苏联各地——从中亚细亚到极北地方，从远东到波罗的海沿岸。他们是工人、技术人员、工程师、集体农民、士兵、军官、学生、教员、职员、社会工作者、政府部长、画家、作家、医生、家庭主妇和各种职业的人们。在卫国战争中失掉了双腿的残废者驾着小车来参观。一位离莫斯科一百六十公里的中等技术学校教员在参观了展览会以后，回去召集已经放暑假的学生们来看。许多人前来看了两次。一位从乌拉季米尔来的纺织女工连看了三次。有不少人仔细地看了几个钟头。人们在暑天排队挥汗参观以后，个人和集体地留下了七千条从心坎里溢出来的挚诚的观感，这些观感满满地写在五十多本意见簿上。
    朴素的言语浸透着深厚友谊。莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的工程师、技师和工人们感动地写道：“我们深深地赞叹中国人民在解放后的短短期间内所得到的巨大成就。你们的成就鼓舞了我们去胜利地完成在技术上帮助人民中国的任务。为着巩固中苏两国人民的恒久友谊，我们将不惜一切力量去劳动。”苏联妇女反法西斯委员会主席波波娃留字说：“精采的展览会，是建设着新生活的自由的中国人民的英勇劳动创造的明证，是中苏两国伟大人民真诚友谊的鲜明表示。祝你们，亲爱的朋友们，取得更多的新成就！愿我们两国人民不可摧毁的恒久友谊更加提高和发展。”
    一群从列宁的故乡来的人们真诚地写道：“我们是从列宁的故乡——乌里扬诺夫斯克来的，让我们从浩荡的伏尔加河两岸把敬意奉献给伟大的中国人民。”
    一位来自建筑着世界最大的水电站——古比雪夫水电站的人，留下了恋恋不舍的心情：“离开展览会是多么惋惜呵！对中国人民的热烈的爱在我的心中燃烧着。一切都是卓越的、美丽的、真实的。真的，中国人将过着非常幸福的生活。衷心地祝毛泽东身体健康。我的心中充满着为中国人民自豪的感觉。”
    一位过去是工人现在是工程师的达尔科夫，带着三岁儿子谢辽沙一道来参观了。谢辽沙称赞在展览会上耐心地向观众讲解的中国留学生说：“中国叔叔好”；达尔科夫写下他的感觉说：“首先希望——那怕是想像的也好——拥抱全中国人民、伟大的新中国人民、我们所喜爱的、我们所同情的、我们所信赖的中国人民。”一位曾经把所有的儿子献给祖国的母亲，在朝鲜停战协定签订以后参观了展览会，她在参观后写道：“在朝鲜停战的日子，我们和你们共同高兴、共同欢欣。你们的胜利就是全世界进步人类的胜利。”
    苏联朋友对于展览会的兴趣是广泛的、多方面的。人们赞叹中国的资源说：“拥有这样丰富资源的中国，经过建设一定成为更加强大的国家。”鞍钢的钢铁、抚顺的煤、巨大的水利工程、自制的工作母机，以及模范车工马鸣贺、纺纱工庄根英、织布工孙玉荣在展览会上的熟练操作，——这一切使人们对于中国工业进步的迅速感到又惊又喜。到过中国的莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂著名高速切削车工布舒耶夫，在参观时当场同马鸣贺交换了经验。莫斯科工具制造厂斯大林奖金得奖人波布罗夫，发现展览机器的通风设备容易发热，就把自己发明的通风设备告诉中国朋友。苏联铁路工作人员看到中国铁路的通车线路从一九四七年的六千八百多公里发展到一九五二年的二万四千三百多公里时说：“好快的速度！”人们细致地询问解说员关于茶叶、高粱、油类等等农产品的生长情况，包含的成分和用途。一位格鲁吉亚农学家请教了桐树的培养方法。一位农业科学博士写道：“特别使我高兴的是中国农民的光辉胜利——中国在三年期间，从谷物和技术作物的输入国，变成了能够向印度和锡兰输出大米的国家。”人们特别喜欢和赏识在轻工业和手工业产品上所表现的中国劳动者的智慧和才能。中苏友好同盟互助条约在克里姆林宫签订和斯大林同志与毛泽东同志晤谈的两大幅绣画前面，经常伫立着大群的参观者。他们反复询问制作者以及制作的时间和方法，并对绣画的姑娘们表示很大的敬意。绸缎和纺织品、刺绣、牙刻和手工艺品也很令人爱好。许多纺织工人来仔细观看。一位妇女曾要求允许她描下刺绣图样。人们写下观感说：“可爱的人民，奇异的手，绝妙的作品”，“真是难于想像，人能作出这样精致的艺术品，这说明中国人民的高度技巧、艺术风格和爱好劳动。”展览会的餐馆每天顾客盈门。人们在这里吃到了中国名厨烹调的烤鸭子、香酥鸡等等中国菜，尝到了中国红茶、绿茶、花茶、黑茶。他们虽然排队等待很久，但都以能够尝到他们认为世界上最好的菜和茶而高兴。有人还希望中国厨师和苏联厨师交换经验。展览会虽专设有中苏友好部，但参观的人们认为所有的展览部分都洋溢着中苏两国的密切友谊。
    在展览会举行期间，莫斯科和苏联各地十多种报纸发表了自己的关于展览会的报道。舆论界的观感和观众是一致的。“消息报”不久前发表的一篇题目叫“建设性劳动的果实”的报道，可以作为代表。这篇报道说：“中国同志三年半中所达到的成就，不能不使我们——苏联人高兴。在这里，在这些使人这样亲切地铭记的伟大人民——邻居和朋友——的和平劳动的胜利的众多展览品旁边，我们好像重新经历了自己年轻的日子，社会主义国家的年轻日子。今天的苏联就是明天的中国。莫斯科的展览会，鲜明地证明着中国人民是怎样迅速地接近着自己的明天。”
