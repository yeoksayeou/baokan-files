Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 22nd: Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, published an article in the New York "Daily Worker" on the 18th, entitled "Dulles Tries to Rekindle the Flames of War." The article stated: The signing of the Korean armistice agreement is a fundamental defeat for the warmongering Eisenhower government. This explains why the government is making its international trouble-making chief, Dulles, busy with a whole set of tricks, planning to continue and intensify world tensions, and attempting to re-launch the Korean War. There is no other way to explain Dulles' reactionary activities regarding the upcoming Korean peace conference.

The article said: One of Dulles' clever ideas is to exclude the Soviet Union from the conference (political conference) by not allowing it to be a member of the United Nations delegation. The article said that another of his ongoing conspiracies to ensure that the peace conference does not yield any results – apparently approved by Eisenhower – is to insist that India not participate in the conference either. The article said: Another of Dulles' most arrogant war conspiracies is his attempt to exclude the People's Republic of China from the United Nations, despite the growing global demand for it to gain a seat in the United Nations. At least three-quarters of the world's people demand that great China obtain a seat in the United Nations. By what right do Dulles and his Wall Street bosses prevent it from obtaining a seat? Indeed, this position is not in the interests of the American people.

The article said: The answer to this question is: excluding the People's Republic of China will prevent the main cause of international tension from being resolved. Dulles knows and fears that if the People's Republic of China obtains a seat in the United Nations, it will be hailed as a great victory for peace, and the last thing Dulles wants is peace.

The article said: Finally, let us mention another of Dulles' current war-provoking conspiracies, which is that he is apparently encouraging the war criminal Syngman Rhee to carry out his well-planned plan to re-launch the Korean War.

The article said: But Eisenhower and Dulles will find that sabotaging peace talks and resuming the war is not as easy as they imagine. Although they arrogantly attempt to disregard the world's peace sentiment, they will find that they must succumb to peace before their doomsday arrives.

The article said: If Eisenhower and Dulles' war policies are to suffer such a serious defeat, the peace forces in our country and other countries must raise their voices. The article said: The situation in Korea is very dangerous. The task of the working class and other peace forces is to completely extinguish this war before war-mongers like Dulles can expand the flames of war.

### 美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特发表文章  号召和平力量击败杜勒斯挑拨战争的阴谋

    美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特发表文章
    号召和平力量击败杜勒斯挑拨战争的阴谋
    【新华社柏林二十二日电】美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特十八日在纽约“工人日报”上发表了一篇文章，题为“杜勒斯企图重新燃起战火”。文章说：朝鲜停战协定的签订，是好战的艾森豪威尔政府的根本性质的失败。这就说明了为什么政府使它的制造国际纠纷者的头子杜勒斯在目前忙忙碌碌地带着一整套的诡计，策划继续和加剧世界紧张局势，并且企图重新发动朝鲜战争。除此以外，没有其他办法可以解释杜勒斯对于即将举行的朝鲜和平会议的反动活动。
    文章说：杜勒斯的一个乖巧的想法是：不让苏联成为联合国代表团的一员，从而把它排斥在会议（政治会议）之外。文章说，他的另外一个正在进行着的使和平会议得不到任何结果的阴谋——这显然是得到艾森豪威尔的批准的——就是坚持使印度也不参加这个会议。文章说：还有一个在杜勒斯所有战争阴谋中最狂妄的一个阴谋，就是他企图把人民中国排斥在联合国之外，而不顾全世界日益要求它在联合国中取得席位。世界上至少有四分之三的人民要求伟大的中国在联合国中取得席位，杜勒斯和他的华尔街老板凭什么权利来阻止它取得席位？实在的，这种立场是不符合美国人民的利益的。
    文章说：对这个问题的答复是：把人民中国排斥在外，则世界局势紧张的主要原因将不能取得解决。杜勒斯知道而且担心：如果人民中国在联合国中取得席位，那将被欢呼为和平的巨大胜利，而杜勒斯最不需要的就是和平。
    文章说：最后，再提一下杜勒斯当前的又一个挑拨战争的阴谋，就是他显然正在怂恿战犯李承晚进行其重新发动朝鲜战争的用心周密的计划。
    文章说：但是，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯将会发现：破坏和平谈判和恢复战争并不如他们所想像的那么容易。虽然，他们目空一切地企图置世界的和平情绪于不顾，但是他们在他们的末日到来以前，将会发现他们必须向和平屈服。
    文章说：如果要使艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的战争政策遭到如此严重的失败，我们这个国家和其他国家的和平力量就必须发出它们的呼声。文章说：朝鲜的形势非常危险。工人阶级和其他和平力量的任务，就是在杜勒斯之类战争贩子得以扩大战火以前，先把这个战火完全扑灭。
