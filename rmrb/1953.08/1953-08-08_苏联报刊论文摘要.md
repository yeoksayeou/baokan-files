Excerpts from Soviet Newspapers
    Political Mobilization in Workshops
    The "Labor News" editorial on July 10th pointed out that the mass mobilization work of the workshop trade union committee is the main driving force for promoting enterprise progress. Excerpts are as follows:
    Every workshop, section, and group is a central venue for mass mobilization work. The fate of the enterprise plan is determined here. A person's attitude towards labor, towards their social responsibilities, and their level of awareness are most clearly manifested here. To connect the general political tasks facing the entire country with the specific work of a group or individual worker, to point out how the overall achievements are accumulated from the efforts of everyone in their respective positions—this is the noble task of a mobilizer. Comrade Muyansnikov, a mobilizer in the hull manufacturing workshop of the "Red Sormovo" factory, demonstrated an excellent example of combative political mobilization work. A few days ago, he held a discussion in his section on "Your Contribution to Communist Construction." This mobilizer talked about how the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are implementing the resolutions of the 19th Party Congress and realizing the Fifth Five-Year Plan. He used convincing and vivid examples to point out the significance of the factory completing its plan for the national economy, and the great role played by each workshop, section, and individual worker in this regard.
    While listening to this mobilizer's speech, the workers more profoundly understood how important their daily labor is, and how significant their responsibility to the common cause is. Therefore, it is only natural that they are eager to express their thoughts and feelings. Many mistakes that were previously considered inevitable are now being sharply criticized. This mobilizer's speech has achieved its purpose.
    There are many examples of such easily understood and effective mobilization work. However, some trade union organizations still have no interest in political education work in workshops. The richest opportunities in this regard are clearly not being fully utilized.
    All the employees of the mechanical workshop of the "Yachibol Metal" United Manufacturing Factory are striving to improve their targets month by month. There are genuine enthusiasts here, but there are also individual workers who do not care about collective interests, work slowly, and treat their duties negligently. However, the trade union committee of this workshop did not influence these comrades, did not explain to them the full extent of their errors, but instead stood by and watched. Comrade Lausayev, the chairman of the workshop committee, believes that educational work is not the business of the trade union organization. This workshop committee avoids participating in wall newspaper work, not a single trade union activist has served as a mobilizer, held discussions with workers, or knows their needs and requirements. Comrade Lausayev doesn't even know which class is leading the way, or who is most enthusiastic in their work. This is very characteristic of him.
    A trade union worker and activist has no right to turn a blind eye to phenomena that disrupt labor discipline, work sloppily, and treat people's property with indifference. In each of these cases, the most important thing is to point out to everyone how much damage this will cause to production, and how one person's negligence will be reflected in the indicators of the entire group and section. This will create an atmosphere of intolerance towards all kinds of mistakes, and cultivate people's sense of responsibility for the work they are engaged in.
    In addition, the names of those who play an exemplary role in their work, show patriotic initiative, and cherish collective honor must be commended. This will spark a surge in efforts to emulate the innovators and borrow their experience.
    Practice has shown that one of the most important reasons for the backwardness of individual workshops and entire enterprises is often due to a lack of attention to political education work.
    For example, the milling and casting workshop of the Zapolosh Steel Plant achieved high targets. Because here, trade union activists read the newspapers every day and organize discussions on current policies. The wall newspapers are full of manuscripts criticizing shortcomings in production work and introducing the experiences of advanced workers. In the workshop, the production target records of competition participants are announced. But in the No. 2 mechanical assembly workshop, the situation is completely different. Here the trade union committee has completely abandoned political education work. The most recent issue of the wall newspaper was published three months ago. Discussions and newspaper readings are only held occasionally, and the experience of advanced workers has not been promoted.
    Trade union organizations should pay more attention to visual mobilization work. It is unacceptable to take a conciliatory attitude towards the fact that competition target bulletin boards in some factories have not been filled in for many weeks, or even many months, and that workshops are still hanging old slogans and propaganda posters. For example, even in advanced enterprises such as the Leningrad "Power Plant," one can still see slogans calling for the launch of the "May Day" socialist competition. In many clubs, there are no photos of the factory's advanced workers, and some halls of fame are decorated crudely and carelessly, which is intolerable. Visual mobilization work should be effective, concrete, and purposeful.

    Improving the Work of Creative Organizations
    The "Truth News" editorial on July 24 pointed out the current problems and main tasks of Soviet creative organizations. Excerpts are as follows:
    Literary and art workers' creative organizations should play a significant role in the creation of works worthy of the people and their great cause, in the communist ideological education of writers, artists, and composers, in bringing them closer to life, and in perfecting their skills. The task of these organizations is to unite art and literature workers; to help them smoothly solve the most important creative problems, to summarize creative practice with Marxist theory, and to propose urgent problems in art development on this basis.
    There are some serious shortcomings in the work of creative organizations. The fundamental shortcoming is that ideological education issues and creative issues have not often become the focus of these organizations' activities. The Soviet Writers Association, the Soviet Artists Association, and the Soviet Composers Association should provide concrete assistance to the work of literary workers, painting art, and musical art workers. However, the leading organs of these associations often indulge in bureaucratic work styles, busy with trivial matters, directly hindering the main and basic things, which will hinder the unfolding of everyone's discussion of current art issues, extensive discussions of new works, and summaries of creative experience.
    One of the fundamental conditions for creative organizations to make their work fruitful is to strictly abide by the principle of collective leadership.
    The insufficient development of criticism and self-criticism has brought serious damage to the activities of creative organizations and the ideological and artistic growth of art cadres. Especially in the Soviet Artists Association, one rarely hears direct criticism of the association's leadership that is of a principled nature.
    Literary magazines and newspapers should play an important role in this regard.
    Creative organizations have not done a good job in organizing, leading, and employing talent, and they have forgotten that their main task is to work with writers, composers, and artists separately. The task of creative organizations is to develop various forms and genres of artistic creation on the basis of socialist realism, starting from the writer's personal talents and creative interests.
    The forms of organizational work cannot tolerate rigidity and stereotypes, and these forms should be changed in accordance with the requirements of the times. One must never work with artists, composers, or writers "in general." One should understand every talented person's creative plans, their needs, one should understand who needs support, who needs sponsorship, and who sometimes needs direct and open comradely criticism. The leadership of some organizations does not rely enough on its main creative cadres. People with prestige, talent, and experience have not been fully absorbed into the activities of various associations.
    The question of policy, the question of the ideological and artistic principles of art development, is a decisive issue for any creative organization. The main task of creative organizations is to create works of high artistic significance that reflect the great power of the Soviet people and the great wisdom of the Communist Party. The activities of these organizations, their leadership activities, and the activities of all literary and art workers should focus on realizing these tasks. An environment that can promote the wide展开 of creative work should be created in the organizations of writers, composers, and artists.
    The activities of creative organizations are the most important aspect of ideological work, and the direct responsibility of local party organizations is to ensure constant, skilled, and principled party leadership in this important field.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    车间的政治鼓动工作
    “劳动报”七月十日发表社论，指出车间工会委员会的群众鼓动工作，是推动企业前进的主要动力。摘要如下：
    每个车间、分间和小组都是群众鼓动工作的中心场所。企业计划的命运正是在这里被决定。一个人对劳动、对自己的社会职责的态度以及他的觉悟程度，正是在这里表现得最明显。把整个国家所面临的一般政治任务和一个小组或个别工人的具体工作联系在一起，指出总的成绩是如何由每个人在自己岗位上的努力积成——这就是一个鼓动员的高尚任务。 “红色索尔莫沃”工厂船身制造车间的鼓动员穆扬斯尼柯夫同志表现出富于战斗性的政治鼓动工作的优良范例。前几天，他在自己的分间中举行了“在共产主义建设中你的贡献”的座谈会。这位鼓动员谈述了苏联人民如何在共产党的领导下执行党的第十九次代表大会的决议，实现着第五个五年计划。他用了令人心服的、鲜明的例子，指出工厂完成计划对于国民经济所具有的意义，指出每个车间、分间和个别工人在这方面所起的巨大作用。
    在听这个鼓动员谈话的时候，工人们更加深刻地领悟到，他们的日常劳动是如何重要，他们对共同事业的责任是如何重大。因此，他们渴望说出自己的思想和感情也是理所当然的。以前认为不可避免的许多错误，现在遭到了尖锐的批评。这位鼓动员的谈话已经达到了目的。
    像这种容易被了解、并具有实效的鼓动工作的范例是很多的。然而有些工会组织对于车间政治教育工作却仍然不发生兴味。这方面的最丰富的机会，显然没有被充分利用。
    “亚契鲍尔金属”联合制造工厂机械车间全体员工逐月地在努力改进自己的指标。这里有真正的热心分子，但也有个别的工人不关心集体利益，慢条斯理地在做工作，玩忽地对待自己的职务。而这个车间的工会委员会，没有去影响这些同志，向他们说明他们行动的全部错误，反而袖手旁观。车间委员会主席劳萨耶夫同志认为教育工作不是工会组织的事。这个车间委员会避不参加出壁报的工作，没有一个工会积极分子当过鼓动员，和工人举行过座谈会，或是知道他们的需要和要求。劳萨耶夫同志甚至不知道那一班走在前面，谁在劳动中表现得最热情。这是很可以作为他的特征的。
    一个工会工作者和积极分子对破坏劳动纪律，工作潦草塞责，和以漠不关心态度对待人民财产的现象，决没有权利避而不问。在每一个这样的情况下，最重要的是要向大家指出这会给生产带来多大的损害，一个人的轻忽会在全小组和全分间的指标上反映出来。这样就会创造出一种对各种过失采取不容忍态度的气氛，并培养人们对所任工作的责任感。
    此外，对于在工作中起示范作用，表现爱国主义主动性，和珍视集体荣誉的人的名字，必须加以表扬。这样，就会掀起努力向革新者看齐并借用他们经验的热潮。
    实践指出，个别车间和整个企业落后的一个最重要的原因常是由于不重视政治教育工作。
    例如，查波洛什钢铁厂铣铁铸造车间达到了高度指标。因为在这里，工会积极分子每天都进行读报，并组织对当前政策的座谈会。墙报上载满了批评生产工作中的缺点和介绍先进者的经验的稿件。在车间中，公布对竞赛参加者的生产指标的纪录。但是在第二号机械装配车间，情形完全两样。在这里工会委员会完全放弃了政治教育工作。最近一期的墙报是在三个月以前出的。座谈会和读报只是偶而举行，对先进工作者的经验也没有加以推广。
    工会组织应当更多地注意形象的鼓动工作。一些工厂的竞赛指标布告牌好多星期，甚至好多月不填写，车间里老是悬挂着陈旧的口号和宣传画，对这种情况是不应采取调和态度的。例如甚至在像列宁格勒“电力厂”这样先进的企业，目前还可以看到号召展开“五一”社会主义竞赛的口号，在很多俱乐部中，看不到该厂先进工作者的像片，一些光荣榜装饰得很粗糙、草率，这是不应容忍的。形象的鼓动工作应当是有效的、具体的和有目的性的。
    改善创作组织的工作
    “真理报”七月二十四日社论，指出苏联创作组织当前的问题及其主要的任务。摘要如下：
    文学和艺术工作者的创作组织，在无愧于人民及其伟大事业的作品的创作上，在对作家、艺术家和作曲家进行共产主义思想的教育，使他们接近生活并使他们的技巧完善起来等工作上，应当起着重大的作用。这些组织的任务，在于团结艺术和文学工作者；帮助他们顺利地解决最重要的创作问题，以马克思主义理论总结创作的实践，并在这个基础上提出艺术发展中的迫切问题。
    在创作组织的工作中存在着一些严重缺点。根本的缺点就是思想教育问题和创作问题没有经常成为这些组织的活动中心。苏联作家协会、苏联艺术家协会和苏联作曲家协会应当对文学工作者、绘画艺术和音乐艺术工作者的工作予以具体的帮助。但是，这些协会的领导机关却往往沉溺于文牍主义作风，忙于一些琐碎事情，直接妨碍到主要的和基本的事物，这会使展开大家对艺术的当前问题的讨论，对新作品的广泛讨论，以及对创作经验的总结受到阻碍。
    创作组织使本身工作富有成果的根本条件之一，就是严格遵守领导集体性的原则。
    批评和自我批评开展得不够充分，给创作组织的活动和艺术干部的思想艺术的增长带来了严重的损害。尤其是在苏联艺术家协会里，很少听得到对协会领导方面具有原则性的直接的批评。
    文学杂志和报纸在这方面应当起着重要的作用。
    创作组织在组织、领导和运用人材的工作上做得还不好，他们忘记了他们主要的任务是对作家、作曲家和艺术家有分别地进行工作。创作组织的任务是从作家的个人才能和创作兴趣出发，在社会主义现实主义的基础上展开各种各样的艺术创作的形式和体裁。
    组织工作的形式是不能容忍僵化和定型化的，这些形式应随时间的要求而有所改变。对艺术家、作曲家或作家决不能“笼统地”进行工作。应当了解每一个有天才的人他的创作计划，他的需求，应当了解谁需要支持、需要赞助、谁有时需要直接的和公开的同志的批评。有些组织的领导对其主要的创作干部的依靠还不够。有威望、有天才和有经验的人们还没有完全被吸收到各协会的活动中去。
    关于方针问题、关于艺术发展的思想艺术原则问题，对于任何创作组织都是决定性的问题。创作组织的主要任务是创造具有高度艺术意义的，反映苏联人民的强大力量和共产党的伟大智慧的作品。这些组织的活动、它们的领导活动，所有的文学和艺术工作者的活动应当着眼于实现这些任务。在作家、作曲家、艺术家的组织中应当创造一种能够促使创作工作广泛展开的环境。
    创作组织的活动是思想工作最重要的方面，地方党组织的直接责任就是保证对这个重要领域的经常的、熟练的和原则性的党的领导。
