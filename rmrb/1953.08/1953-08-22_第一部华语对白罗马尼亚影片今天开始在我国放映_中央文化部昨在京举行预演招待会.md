Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: The first Romanian People's Republic film dubbed into Chinese dialogue, "For a Better Life," will be released in Beijing starting August 22nd—on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the Soviet Army's liberation of Romania. Major cities across the country will also release the film in succession soon. The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government held an advance screening reception at the Capital Cinema in Beijing on the evening of August 21st.

    This film depicts the story of a Romanian scientist participating in socialist construction. The scientist, Don Aurian, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the support of the working class, breaks away from the influence of reactionary bourgeois cosmopolitan scientific thought, adheres to the position of serving the people with scientific research, and finally overcomes the sabotage of American imperialist agents, successfully experimenting with a method of smelting high-quality pig iron that is extremely important for national industrialization. This film vividly illustrates that scientific work can only achieve brilliant success by serving the construction of the motherland. The film also powerfully points out that the liberated people, in order to defend the peaceful construction of their motherland, must wage a resolute struggle against imperialist sabotage plots and reactionary bourgeois cultural thought at all times and everywhere. The Romanian actor Flaka, who plays Aurian, received an honorary award at the 6th International Film Festival for his excellent performance in this film.

    The reception on the 21st was hosted by Ding Xilin, Vice Minister of Culture. More than a thousand film workers from the capital, as well as well-known writers, playwrights, directors, actors, and young literary and art workers, attended the reception. Romanian Ambassador to China, Guo Zuowen, and embassy staff were invited to attend the reception.

    Vice Minister Ding Xilin and Ambassador Guo Zuowen both spoke at the reception. Vice Minister Ding Xilin said that the cultural exchanges between China and Romania have greatly developed in recent years, and the performance of the Romanian film "For a Better Life" will strengthen this cultural exchange and strengthen the brotherly friendship and cooperation between the two peoples. Ambassador Guo Zuowen, in his speech, described the development of the Romanian people's film industry and the Romanian people's love for Chinese films, and expressed the Romanian people's deep brotherly friendship towards the Chinese people.

    All those who attended the reception were greatly interested in the film "For a Better Life."

    二十一日的招待会是由文化部副部长丁西林主持的。出席招待会的有首都的电影工作者及著名的作家、戏剧家、导演、演员和青年文艺工作者一千多人。罗马尼亚驻我国大使郭佐文和使馆人员应邀出席了招待会。
