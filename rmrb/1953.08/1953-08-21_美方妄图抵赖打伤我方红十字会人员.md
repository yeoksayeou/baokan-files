Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 20th - On August 14th and 15th, the Korean-Chinese side lodged a serious protest against the United Nations Command's excessive restrictions and obstruction of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives who went to the United Nations Command's prisoner-of-war camps to work, and even the persecution of their persons. At the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee meeting on August 19th, the United Nations Command not only showed no remorse for the above unreasonable behavior that violated the Armistice Agreement and the Joint Red Cross Team's work agreement, but also categorically denied it, attempting to deny the ironclad facts.

The Korean-Chinese side solemnly pointed out at the meeting on August 19th: Regarding the incident on August 13th in which a United Nations Command guard used a gun to strike Mr. Pan Fang, a Korean-Chinese representative of the Imjin River Bridge Group of the Joint Red Cross Team South Group, when representatives of both Red Cross societies went to the site for a joint investigation after the incident, the guard admitted on the spot that he had received an order from the local prisoner-of-war management authority to use his gun to interfere with Mr. Pan Fang and other Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives when they came out of the tent. After the above incident, the prisoner-of-war management authority told Mr. Pan Fang that the guard was "a new recruit." The United Nations Command Red Cross representative, who also served as the chairman of the Imjin River Bridge Group, also said that the guard was "a young man." These are ironclad evidence of the United Nations Command's persecution of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives. How can the United Nations Command deny it?

The Korean-Chinese side also pointed out at the meeting on August 19th that, according to recent reports from the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives on Geoje Island, one United Nations Command prisoner-of-war camp unreasonably prohibited the Joint Red Cross Team's groups from entering any prisoner-of-war camp. They could only observe from a place more than 100 meters away from the barbed wire surrounding the prisoner-of-war camp. Another United Nations Command prisoner-of-war camp unreasonably stipulated that representatives of the Joint Red Cross Team could only talk to one prisoner of war in a small camp, and could only visit the prisoner-of-war camp's dormitory, kitchen, and other facilities when the prisoner of war was not present at all. These facts all show that the United Nations Command continues to impose all kinds of restrictions and obstructions on the work of the Joint Red Cross Team representatives, making it impossible for them to visit prisoners of war in accordance with the explicit provisions of the Armistice Agreement and the Joint Red Cross Team's work agreement, and to hold discussions with prisoners of war regarding their welfare in order to understand the living conditions of the prisoners of war.

The United Nations Command's consistent and continued frantic persecution of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, as well as the various unreasonable restrictions, obstructions, and even persecution that the United Nations Command has constantly taken against the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives who went to the United Nations Command's prisoner-of-war camps to understand the real situation of the various prisoner-of-war camps and provide humanitarian services to the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, once again reveals the true faces of the murderers who claim to be humanitarians to the people of the world.

    美方妄图抵赖打伤我方红十字会人员
    【新华社开城二十日电】八月十四日与十五日，朝中方面曾严重抗议联合国军方面对赴联合国军看管战俘地点工作的朝中红十字会代表横加限制与阻挠，甚至于对他们的人身进行迫害。在八月十九日的战俘遣返委员会会议上，联合国军方面对上述违反停战协定与联合红十字会小组工作协议的无理行为，不但毫无反悔表示，而且矢口抵赖，妄图否认铁的事实。
    朝中方面在八月十九日会上郑重指出：关于八月十三日联合国军警卫人员举枪撞击联合红十字会小组南组临津江桥分组朝中代表潘芳先生事件，双方红十字会代表于事后赴该地进行共同调查时，该警卫人员已当场供认：他曾接得当地战俘管理当局的命令，叫他在潘芳先生等朝中红十字会代表出帐篷时，用枪来干涉他们。而在上述事件发生后，该战俘管理当局曾向潘芳先生说：该警卫“是一个新兵”。同时担任临津江桥分组主席的联合国军方面红十字会代表也说：该警卫“是个青年人”。这些都是联合国军方面对朝中红十字会代表进行人身迫害的铁证，联合国军方面怎能否认？
    朝中方面在八月十九日会上并指出：根据巨济岛朝中红十字会代表最近的报告，联合国军一个战俘营竟无理禁止联合红十字会小组的分组进入任何战俘营场。而只能在离战俘营场周围铁丝网一百公尺以上的地方瞭望。联合国军另一个战俘营则无理规定：联合红十字会小组代表只能在一个小营地与一名战俘谈话，并只能在战俘根本不在场时才能参观战俘营的宿舍、伙房及其他设备。这些事实都表明：联合国军方面直到目前为止，仍继续对联合红十字会小组代表的工作百般限制与阻挠，使他们无法根据停战协定与联合红十字会小组工作协议的明文规定去访问战俘，与战俘举行有关其福利的座谈会以了解战俘的生活情况。
    联合国军方面对朝中被俘人员所一贯进行并继续进行的疯狂迫害，以及联合国军方面对赴联合国军看管战俘地点了解各该战俘营的真实情况，并为朝中被俘人员提供人道主义服务的朝中红十字会代表所不断采取的种种无理限制、阻挠乃至于迫害，再一次在全世界人民面前显露出自称为人道主义者的凶手们的真面目。
