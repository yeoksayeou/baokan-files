Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 18th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru made a statement in the Indian Parliament's House of the People on the 17th regarding the Korean issue.

    Prime Minister Nehru, in discussing the situation after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, said: "The conclusion of the armistice agreement is a great event, but the future is fraught with difficulties. The armistice agreement stipulates that, in order to ensure a peaceful settlement of the Korean question, a high-level political conference between the two sides should be held within three months after the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement to 'discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, etc.' These are difficult issues, and if we want to resolve them satisfactorily, we need calm and dispassionate consideration and a will to strive for peace. Unfortunately, there have been various indications recently that this will to strive for peace is not always visible, and there have even been threats. One side has said that unless its demands are met within a certain period, it reserves the right to resume the war. Agreements have been concluded, guarantees have been provided, but none have been fully disclosed, and we do not know how much will be revealed when the political conference formally discusses this issue."
    Nehru said that the United Nations General Assembly is meeting in New York to consider this issue. "But it must be remembered that the armistice agreement is an agreement between two parties, and the United Nations General Assembly represents one of them, namely the United Nations Command. Any decision, if it is to be effective, must be agreed upon by both parties."
    Nehru said: "I sincerely hope that people will approach this conference with a peaceful state of mind and a firm determination to resolve the Far Eastern issues peacefully. Any resumption of the Korean War would be a tragedy, and anything that encourages a war atmosphere would be unfortunate."

    印度总理尼赫鲁就朝鲜问题发表声明
    【新华社新德里十八日电】印度总理尼赫鲁十七日在印度国会人民院就朝鲜问题发表声明。
    尼赫鲁总理在谈到朝鲜停战协定签订以后的形势时说：“停战协定的缔结是伟大的事件，但是前途充满困难。停战协定规定，为了保证朝鲜问题的和平解决起见，在停战协定签字并生效后的三个月内，应举行双方高一级的政治会议，‘协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题’。这些问题都是困难的问题，如果要想圆满地解决这些问题的话，需要冷静的心平气和的考虑和争取和平的意志。不幸，最近一直有各种迹象说明这种争取和平的意志不是经常可以看到的，甚至还有人发出威胁。一方已经说，除非在一定时间内答应它的要求，否则，它保留再度发动战争的权利。协议缔结了，保证提供了，但都没有完全公布，我们也不知道在政治会议正式讨论这个问题时，会有多少透露出来。”
    尼赫鲁说，联合国大会正在纽约开会，以考虑这个问题。“但必须记得，停战协定是两方之间的协定，联合国大会代表其中一方，就是联合国军司令部。任何决定，如果要有效的话，就必须得到双方的同意。”
    尼赫鲁说：“我诚恳地希望人们在对待这个会议时能抱着和平的心情，并坚定地决心以和平方式解决远东问题。任何朝鲜战争的复起都将是悲剧，任何鼓励战争气氛的事物都将是不幸。”
