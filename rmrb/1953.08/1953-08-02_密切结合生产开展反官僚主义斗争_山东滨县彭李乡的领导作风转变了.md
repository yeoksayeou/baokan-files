    Closely Integrating with Production to Carry Out the Anti-Bureaucracy Struggle
    Leadership Style Transformation in Pengli Township, Bin County, Shandong
    In the spring production this year, Pengli Township, Bin County, Second District, Shandong Province, launched a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, improved its leadership style, strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses, and completed the spring plowing production task.
    1. According to the Party's instructions, understand the demands of the masses, combine the Party's instructions with the demands of the masses, and lead the masses to carry out work.
    Due to the long-term existence of bureaucratic style and generalized leadership in the past, cadres generally wanted to hold a lot of meetings and deploy a lot of tasks as soon as they went to the countryside. Cadres from various departments demanded that each be attached a string when assigning tasks. The peasants were afraid of delaying production by only attending meetings, and they were very dissatisfied with the fact that the cadres only talked like outsiders when leading production and still had to obey them. Based on the above situation, the following measures were taken:
    First, resolutely implement the central task of prioritizing production above all else, so that cadres from all departments are unified under the leadership of the local Party committee and serve spring plowing production, not allowing each to act on its own and arbitrarily issue orders to the masses. When assigning tasks, first grasp the center, then combine it with other tasks, and correct the method of advancing on all fronts. It is stipulated that after arriving in the village, the demands of the peasants should be understood and concentrated first, and mass meetings should not be held arbitrarily. Cadres should go deep into the grassroots, and any work should be done in favor of production, reducing all unnecessary burdens on village cadres. At the beginning, the cadres acted according to these regulations, although reluctantly, but after studying the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Shandong Branch, and deeply understanding and analyzing the demands of the masses, they gradually became more conscious.
    Second, after arriving in the village, hold small-scale seminars to investigate and understand the demands of the peasants. It was learned that the land in the township is alkaline and not easy to grow full seedlings, and the output of general land is too low, so the farmers' lives are relatively difficult. At the same time, the Huimin Prefectural Committee and the Huimin Administrative Office of the CPC built houses here and requisitioned a large amount of land from the farmers, which caused some farmers to have difficulties in production and life, and a large number of laborers went out to engage in sideline production. Therefore, the most prominent and concentrated demands of the farmers in the township are: to increase production and solve the contradictions between agricultural and sideline production. For example, to
    require the government to provide loans to buy livestock, fertilizers, and agricultural implements, to require the improvement of cultivation
    techniques, to require the resolution of contradictions between agricultural and sideline production; farmers who have lost land
    require the resolution of land issues; organized farmers want to improve
    the methods of mutual aid teams; and in villages where bad elements are in power, the masses demand the punishment of
    bad elements. After summarizing the above-mentioned demands of the peasants,
    they further went deep into the masses, discussed with the masses on how to solve these problems, and then formulated a preliminary plan. This changed the past task-oriented view that only came from above and adopted the working method of first coming from the masses and then going to the masses, thereby combining leadership thinking with the masses. The masses reflected: "This year, production is really the center, and the government is really doing things for us," "There are fewer meetings and more work." District and township cadres reflected: "Although it was said that production was the center last year, one center was combined with fourteen items, and as a result, there was a center in the articles, but no center in practice. This year, what is said and what is done has a center." Village cadres and activists said: "There is time for production."
    2. Hold the township people's representative meeting well, concentrate on reflecting and solving the demands of the masses, and turn the Party's policies into resolutions of the masses.
    At the township people's representative meeting, the two basic demands of the peasants for production and democracy were grasped, and three links were seized: First, through the speeches of various typical figures, the opinions and demands of the masses were concentratedly reflected, and solutions to the problems were provided. For example, through many high-yield models introducing the experience of increasing production, the methods of preserving seedlings and increasing production were pointed out; through better mutual aid teams, the benefits of organization and the methods of managing mutual aid teams were introduced; through mutual aid teams combining agricultural and sideline production, the demands of disaster-stricken farmers were reflected, and the methods of solving disaster problems were pointed out, etc. Finally, according to the opinions of the masses, a resolution on spring production was formulated. Second, prominent violations of law and discipline were handled in a big way, fully promoting democracy, strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses, and improving the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants. Dong Guitang, a public security officer in the district, in order to force Wei Quanlin's aunt to marry his uncle and take away all the property, fabricated five charges against Wei Quanlin, submitted them to the county public security bureau for approval, designated Wei Quanlin as a counter-revolutionary element, announced two years of control, and held a mass meeting to threaten the masses, saying: "No one is allowed to approach him, no one is allowed to talk to him, whoever approaches him is harboring a counter-revolutionary and is guilty of the same crime." The representatives exposed this serious case of violation of law and discipline and seriously discussed the handling opinions. According to the opinions of the masses, the township people's government reported to the higher-level people's government and brought Dong Guitang to justice. In addition, various proposals made by the representatives were also dealt with separately. Third, by exhibiting agricultural implements, fertilizers, seeds, etc., the demands of supply and marketing and the peasant masses were combined, thereby improving the supply and marketing and credit work. The supply and marketing cooperative displayed a part of the agricultural implements, seeds, and fertilizers prepared to supply the peasants at the representative meeting for the representatives to visit. After the visit, the representatives put forward many criticisms. According to the opinions of the representatives, the cooperative conducted a thorough inventory of all the agricultural implements in the society, and found that there were 816 agricultural implements, of which 564 were usable, and 252 had problems and were unusable; from then on, the reason for the long-term backlog of agricultural implements in the cooperative was discovered, mainly due to rough manufacturing and unqualified specifications, and the peasants were reluctant to buy them. After that, according to the opinions of the masses, the agricultural implements with problems were repaired and improved, and it was stipulated that in the future, when manufacturing agricultural implements, the opinions of the masses should be solicited in advance to determine the style and specifications to avoid blindly rough manufacturing. The Sizi cotton fine variety and 811 grain variety to be promoted in the township were also exhibited at the meeting and compared in detail with the farmers' own seeds, so that the representatives could see the benefits of the fine varieties with their own eyes. At the same time, the difficulties of the farmers in changing fine varieties were also solved, so that 90% of the farmers in the township automatically changed to Sizi cotton fine varieties, and most of the farmers changed to 811 grain varieties. Because this meeting fully promoted democracy, the resolutions were seriously implemented after the meeting, agricultural loans were issued in a timely and correct manner, disaster victims were relieved, production methods were found for them, land was found for farmers who had lost land, and 160 mu of wasteland was found for farmers with less land in Bujiaya and Fanjiaya villages, thereby strengthening the relationship between the Party and the government and the masses and improving the peasants' enthusiasm for production. The masses reflected: "The government is really doing things for the masses! Last year, the cadres said what to do, and now we demand what to do, and the cadres lead us to do it." Township cadres said:
    "Last year, leading production was for the district, and this year it is for the masses."
    3. Learn from the experience of advanced regions, invite experienced farmers as teachers, summarize the production experience of the masses, find the key to increasing production, and overcome generalized leadership.
    Due to the bureaucracy of the leadership in the past and the serious commandism in the work style of the cadres, most of the cadres did not understand the general knowledge of agricultural production, and only knew "more hoeing, more harrowing, and more fertilization"; the peasants believed that the cadres were laymen in leading production. Some farmers once said: "Last year, we suffered losses after listening to the government's call. We hoed and harrowed vigorously, but as a result, the land became hard and could not hold the seedlings." In order to find ways to increase production and methods to lead farmers in production, the cadres were mobilized to learn from the advanced experiences of Zhaoyuan County and Junan County, and local experienced farmers were invited as teachers to summarize their high-yield experience and find the secrets to increasing production. Many typical households were found to study and summarize their experience, so that the characteristics of the township were discovered: there is a lot of alkaline land and a lot of cotton. The key to increasing production is: to obtain full seedlings and strive for early maturity of cotton. The experience of high-yield cotton was specifically analyzed, and the reasons for the reduction of cotton production were discovered. In particular, after weighing the cotton bolls, checking the number of plants, and calculating the yield, it was found that the reason for the low yield was the lack of seedlings. For example, the result of the calculation in Majia was that cotton averaged one jin per hundred peaches, one plant had seven peaches, and there were 3,920 plants per mu, so the yield should be more than 270 jin, but the actual yield was 125 jin. After this calculation, the farmers were shocked. Then the cadres led the farmers to check the seedlings. For example, the result of checking wheat was that the best was lacking 33%, the worst was lacking 83%, and the general was lacking 50% to 60%. The farmers said: "In the past, we didn't care about the lack of seedlings, thinking that sparse crops grew big ears and resting the land was like fertilizing; now it seems that we have been fooled, and the old methods don't work." On this basis, the specific reasons for the lack of seedlings and the experience of preserving seedlings were deeply studied and gradually promoted. Now, ensuring complete spring seedlings in the township has become the conscious action of the broad masses of peasants. After the spring seedlings come out, the farmers immediately launched a movement to check seedlings, replant seedlings, and eliminate pests. The farmers reflected: "The cadres led by Chairman Mao are good at everything, and they have become experts in leading production."
    4. Seize typical examples, set a good example, patiently persuade, and use the facts and experience of the masses to educate the masses. This is an effective measure to overcome generalized leadership.
    Due to the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy and the conservative and worried mentality of the peasants in production, any production measure and technological reform must first be typical examples. In this way, the facts can be shown to the farmers, and only after the farmers see the benefits can they be accepted by the farmers. Similarly, cadres can also gain direct experience through typical examples and correct subjectivism and commandism. Experience has proved that as long as any work is done well and the example is shown to the farmers, it can be quickly promoted. For example, Cai Liu Village seized the Lei Yixiang mutual aid team and often introduced his team's achievements in production to the farmers and often absorbed the farmers to visit his team. As a result, under the influence of this team, the village developed from two teams to ten teams this spring. In the promotion of chemical fertilizers, at the beginning, the farmers did not believe in the role of chemical fertilizers, so they found several typical households to experiment when planting wheat. Half of the land was fertilized and half was left. A month later, the wheat that was fertilized with chemical fertilizers was tall and green, and the wheat that was not fertilized was short and yellow, so the farmers all believed it. When soaking seeds, some farmers did not believe in the benefits of soaking seeds. They first used half of the soaked seeds and half of the unsoaked seeds in a plot of land. As a result, the soaked seeds emerged in seven or eight days, and the unsoaked seeds emerged in ten to eleven days. The soaked seeds grew vigorously, and the unsoaked seeds did not grow vigorously. The same is true for setting production increase plans and studying production increase methods. At the beginning, the farmers had no confidence in increasing production, so they first helped a team to carefully study and formulate a production increase plan, so everyone learned from them. The facts have repeatedly proved that seizing typical examples, first setting an example, adopting comparative methods, educating the masses with their own experience, and gradually promoting methods from shallow to deep are the easiest to be accepted by the peasants.
    5. Through mutual aid and cooperation organizations, unite and lead individual farmers to complete the spring plowing and sowing tasks. At the same time, the key to production was grasped, and the mutual aid and cooperation organizations were rectified and consolidated.
    In all aspects of spring plowing production, individual farmers were united and led through mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Especially in sowing, the mutual aid team was the basis. Exchange of labor was carried out between teams, and households without labor and individual farmers lacking livestock and agricultural implements were actively assisted to solve the difficulties in sowing, thereby overcoming the difficulties in production and ensuring timely sowing. In villages with a stronger foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, the mutual aid teams first formulated sowing plans and put forward the slogan "Teams exchange labor with each other, actively help individual farmers to sow land in time, and strive for high yields in the whole village." The mutual aid teams took the initiative to find targets to help them sow, and the wages were calculated according to the market price of the manpower and livestock used. Households with money paid wages at that time, and households in difficulty paid after the wheat harvest. At the same time, mutual aid teams with strong labor, livestock, and agricultural implements actively helped the weak teams. In villages with a weaker foundation for mutual aid, a large number of temporary mutual aid teams were organized. A total of 26 temporary mutual aid teams were organized in the whole township during the spring plowing and sowing (statistics from six villages). In this way, the difficulties in production were overcome in the case of insufficient livestock and agricultural implements, and the sowing was completed in six or seven days, thereby strengthening the unity between teams and especially uniting individual farmers effectively. Mutual aid team members said: "The more you do this, the more consolidated the mutual aid team becomes." Individual farmers said: "Mutual aid teams are not only good for themselves, but also good for the whole village." Originally, they thought that with mutual aid teams, there would be no place to hire people, and there would be no place to borrow livestock and furniture. As a result, the mutual aid teams took the initiative to help them plant land this year. Now many of them are asking to join the mutual aid teams. In the entire spring plowing production process, the various links in production were tightly grasped, and the mutual aid teams were reorganized and consolidated. In the past, whenever the reorganization and consolidation of mutual aid teams was mentioned, it was about recording work points and accounting, and the central issue of how to increase production was often neglected. This time, the reorganization and consolidation of mutual aid organizations first helped the mutual aid teams study how to increase production. When the Majia Agricultural Production Cooperative began to study the production increase plan, it felt that too little fertilizer was applied in the past and the land was too weak. It required loans and fertilizer application, but it also thought that if it only relied on loans to solve the problem, even if the production increased, it would not increase income. Therefore, they studied the methods of accumulating fertilizer and planned to accumulate 250 carts of fertilizer this year, thereby solving the basal fertilizer for next year (they accumulated a total of 65 carts throughout the year last year). In the production process, simple and easy-to-implement methods of recording work points and accounting were gradually introduced and promoted through typical demonstrations. In this way, the mutual aid teams were gradually improved with the development of farmers' experience. (Reprinted from Shandong Dazhong Daily)

    密切结合生产开展反官僚主义斗争
    山东滨县彭李乡的领导作风转变了
    山东省滨县二区彭李乡，在今年春季生产中开展了反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪的斗争，改进了领导作风，密切了党与群众的关系，完成了春耕生产任务。
    一、根据党的指示，了解群众要求，把党的指示和群众要求结合起来，领导群众进行工作。
    由于过去领导方面长期存在着官僚主义作风和一般化的领导，因此，当着干部下乡时，一般都想马上召开一大套会，布置一大堆任务；各部门的干部要求在布置工作时，都给挂上一条。农民群众则怕光开会耽误生产，认为干部领导生产光说外行话，还得依从他，对这点很不满意。根据以上情况，便采取了以下的措施：
    第一、坚决贯彻以生产为压倒一切的中心任务，使各部门干部都统一在当地党委领导下，为春耕生产服务，不许各自为政，乱对群众发号施令。在布置任务时，先抓中心，后带结合，纠正齐头并进的办法。规定到村之后，先了解和集中群众的要求，不得随意召开群众大会。干部要深入下去，任何工作都要有利生产才能办，给村干部减去一切不必要的负担。在开始时干部按照这些规定办事，虽然很勉强，后经学习党中央及山东分局的指示与深入了解和分析了群众要求之后，就逐渐自觉了。
    第二，到村之后，先召开小型座谈会，调查了解农民群众的要求。了解到该乡的土地是碱性，不易全苗，一般土地产量太低，因之农民生活比较困难。同时，中共惠民地委、惠民专署机关在此修建房屋，征购了农民大批土地，致使有些农民在生产上和生活上发生困难，有大批的劳动力外出，从事副业生产。因而该乡农民最突出的集中的要求是：提高产量，解决农、副业生产中的矛盾。如要
    求政府贷款买牲口、肥料和农具，要求改进耕作技
    术，要求解决农副业生产中的矛盾；失掉土地的农
    民，要求解决土地问题；组织起来的农民就要改进
    互助组的办法；坏分子当道的村庄，群众则要求惩
    治坏分子。在总结了上述农民群众的要求之后，
    又进一步深入群众，和群众商量解决这些问题的办法，然后制订了初步计划。这样就改变了过去那种光从上边来的任务观点，采取了先从群众中来，再到群众中去的工作方法，从而使领导思想和群众结合起来。群众反映：“今年真是以生产为中心了，政府真给咱办事了”，“开会少了，办事多了。”区乡干部反映：“去年虽说以生产为中心，但是一项中心带着十四项结合，结果条文上有中心，作起来没中心，今年说的作的都有中心了。”村干部积极分子说：“有空生产了。”
    二、开好乡人民代表会议，集中反映和解决群众的要求，把党的政策变成群众的决议。
    在乡人民代表会议上，掌握了农民对生产和民主的两项基本要求，抓住了三个环节：第一，通过各种典型人物的发言，集中反映了群众意见和要求，提供了解决问题的办法。如通过许多丰产模范介绍增产经验，指出了保苗增产的办法；通过较好的互助组介绍了组织起来的好处及管理互助组的办法；通过农副业生产结合的互助组，反映了受灾农民的要求，指出了解决灾荒问题的办法等。最后，根据群众的意见，制订了春季生产的决议。第二，抓住突出的违法乱纪事件进行了大张旗鼓的处理，充分发扬了民主，密切党与群众的关系，提高了广大农民的生产积极性。该区公安员董桂堂，为了强要农民魏全林的婶母嫁给他大爷，并要其全部带走财产，他便给魏全林捏造了五条罪状，呈报县公安局批准，把魏全林定为反革命分子，宣布管制二年，并召开群众大会，威胁群众说：“谁都不准和他接近，不准和他谈话，谁接近他就是包庇反革命，与他同罪。”代表们揭发了这一严重的违法乱纪案件，并认真讨论了处理意见。乡人民政府根据群众意见，报请上级人民政府，法办了董桂堂。此外，对于代表们提的各种提案，也都分别作了处理。第三，通过展览农具、肥料、种子等，使供销和农民群众要求相结合，从而改进了供销、信贷工作。供销合作社将准备供应农民的一部分农具、种子、肥料，在代表会上陈列出来，让代表们参观。参观后，代表们提出了很多批评意见。合作社又根据代表们的意见，将社内的全部农具作了一次清查，结果共有农具八百一十六件，其中能用的有五百六十四件，有毛病和不能用的有二百五十二件；从此，便发现了合作社的农具长期积压的原因，主要是由于粗制滥造，不合规格，农民不乐意买。此后即根据群众意见，对有毛病的农具加以修理改进，并规定今后在制造农具时，要事先征求群众意见，规定样式规格，避免盲目地粗制滥造。要在该乡推广的斯字棉良种及八一一谷种，也在会上进行了展览，并与农民自己的种子进行了详细的比较说明，使代表们亲眼看到了良种的好处。同时又帮助农民解决了换良种的困难，因而使该乡百分之九十的农民都自动换了斯字棉良种，绝大部分农民换了八一一谷种。由于这次会议充分地发扬了民主，会后又认真贯彻了决议，及时正确地发放了农贷，对灾民进行了救济，使其找到了生产门路，帮助失掉土地的农民找到了土地，为卜家和樊家两村地少的农民找到了一百六十亩开荒地，从而密切了党和政府与群众的关系，提高了农民生产积极性。群众反映：“政府真给群众办事了！去年干部说怎样办就怎样办，现在是我们要求什么，干部便领导干什么。”乡干部说：
    “去年领导生产是为区里干的，今年是为群众干的了。”
    三、学习先进地区经验，请有经验的农民作老师，总结群众生产经验，找到了增产关键，克服了一般化的领导。
    由于过去领导方面的官僚主义，干部作风上的严重命令主义，因而绝大部分干部对于农业生产一般知识都不了解，只知“多锄、多耙、多上粪”；农民则认为干部领导生产是外行，有的农民曾说：“去年听了政府的号召，吃了亏，猛锄猛耙，结果把地弄板了，拿不住苗了。”为了找增产的办法和领导农民生产的方法，发动干部学习了肇源县和莒南县的先进经验，请当地有经验的农民为老师，总结他们的丰产经验，寻找增产窍门。找了许多典型户来研究总结他们的经验，从而发现该乡的特点是：碱地多，棉花多，增产的关键是：拿全苗，和争取棉花早熟。具体分析了棉花丰产的经验，发现了棉花减产的原因，特别是经过称穗头、查棵数，算产量，发现了产量不高的原因是缺苗子。如在马家算的结果，棉花平均要一百个桃一斤，一棵有七个桃，每亩三千九百二十棵，这样计算产量应收二百七十多斤，但实产量一百二十五斤。这样一算，农民大吃一惊。接着干部就领农民去查苗子，如查小麦的结果，最好的是缺百分之三十三，最差的竟缺百分之八十三，一般的缺到百分之五十到六十。农民们说：“过去对缺苗不在乎，认为稀谷长大穗，歇地如上粪；现在看来是上当了，老法子不行了。”在这个基础上，深入研究了缺苗的具体原因和保苗经验，加以逐步推广，现在该乡保证春苗齐全已成为广大农民的自觉行动，在春苗出来之后，农民们便马上掀起查苗、补苗、除害虫的运动。农民们反映：“毛主席领导的干部，干啥也是好样的，领导生产也变成内行了。”
    四、抓住典型，作好样子，耐心说服，以群众的事实和经验去教育群众，这是克服一般化领导的有效措施。
    由于小农经济的特点，和农民在生产中保守性、患得患失心理，因此，对任何一项生产措施和技术改革，都必须首先搞典型作样子。这样便可以把事实摆给农民看，使农民看到好处后，才可能为农民所接受，同样又可使干部通过搞典型取得直接经验，纠正主观主义和命令主义。经验证明：任何一项工作，只要作好样子，又善于把样子摆出来给农民看，这样就可迅速推开。如蔡刘村抓住了雷义祥互助组，以他组在生产上的成绩，经常介绍给农民听，并经常吸收农民到他组参观，结果该村在这个组的影响下，今春即由二个组发展到十个组。在推广化学肥料上，开始农民不相信化学肥料的作用，便找了几个典型户，在种麦时试验，一块地施上一半，留一半，一个月之后，施化学肥料的麦子又高又绿，没施化学肥料的又矮又黄，农民便都相信了。在浸种时，有的农民不相信浸种的好处。他们便先在一块地中使上一半浸了的种，一半没浸的种，结果浸种的七天到八天出齐了，没浸种的十天到十一天才出齐，浸种的长得旺，没浸种的长得不旺。在订增产计划，研究增产办法上也是如此，开始农民对增产没有信心，便首先帮助一个组，仔细研究制订了增产计划，这样大家就都向他们学了。事实一再证明：抓住典型，先作出样子，采用比较的方法，以群众自己的经验来教育群众，由浅入深，逐步推广的方法是最容易为农民所接受的。
    五、通过互助合作组织，团结带动单干农民，完成春耕春种任务，同时又抓住了生产关键，整顿巩固了互助合作组织。
    在春耕生产的各项工作中都是通过互助合作组织，团结带动个体农民来进行的。特别是在播种中以互助组为基础。组与组之间进行了换工，并主动地帮助无劳动力户和缺乏牲口、农具的个体农民，解决播种中的困难，从而克服了生产中的困难，保证了适时播种。在互助合作基础较强的村庄，互助组首先订出了播种计划，同时提出了“组与组互相换工，主动帮助单干农民及时种上地，争取全村丰产”的口号。互助组各自主动找对象帮助他们播种，工资按照用的人力、牲口以市价计算，有钱的户当时支工资，困难户，麦收后支付。同时劳动力、牲口、农具强的互助组又主动地帮助了弱的组。在互助基础较弱的村庄，则大量组织了临时互助组，全乡在春耕播种中共组织了临时互助组二十六个（六个村的统计）。这样便使在牲口、农具不足的情况下，六、七天的时间，即全部完成了播种，从而密切了组与组之间的团结，特别是有力地团结了单干农民。互助组员说：“这样干法，互助组越干越巩固。”单干农民说：“互助组不但对他们自己有好处，对全村都有好处。”原来他们认为：有了互助组，人没处雇了，牲口家具没处借了，结果今年互助组还主动帮助他们种上了地。现在他们中很多人都要求参加互助组。在整个春耕生产过程中，又紧紧地掌握了生产的各个环节，整理巩固了互助组。过去往往一提到整理巩固互助组，就是要搞记工算账，而对如何增产的中心问题，则往往被忽视。这次整理巩固互助组织，就是首先帮助互助组研究如何增产。马家农业生产合作社，在开始研究增产计划时，便感到过去施肥太少，地力太薄，要求贷款及施肥料，但是又想到若光靠贷款解决，就是增产了也不能增加收入，因此他们便研究了积肥办法，计划今年积肥二百五十车，这样便解决了明年的基肥（去年他们全年共积了六十五车）。在生产过程中，逐渐通过典型示范，介绍推广简便易行的记工算账办法。这样使互助组随着农民经验的发展得到逐步提高。（转载山东大众日报）
