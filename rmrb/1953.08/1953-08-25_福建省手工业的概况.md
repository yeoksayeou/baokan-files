A general overview of the handicraft industry in Fujian Province

From late April, the cities of Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou, the eight special districts of Jianyang, Nanping, Fu'an, Minhou, Jinjiang, Longxi, Yong'an, and Longyan, the counties of Jian'ou, Pucheng, Sha County, Shunchang, Fuqing, Luoyuan, Nan'an, Hui'an, Xianyou, Tong'an, Dehua, Ningde, Putian, Haicheng, Dongshan, and the towns of Shima, Hanjiang, Shishi, and Nanyu in Fujian province, selectively and systematically carried out handicraft industry surveys, focusing on key areas. Through the surveys, we gained a preliminary understanding of the handicraft industry, studied and analyzed the existing problems, and in many areas, also initially put forward opinions on how to lead handicraft production in the future.

Handicraft industry accounts for a large proportion of the national economy in Fujian Province. According to incomplete statistics from various special districts and cities, the total output value of the handicraft industry accounts for approximately 13 percent of the province's national economy and about 70 percent of the total industrial output value. In the four cities of Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou, there are a total of 10,629 handicraft households, accounting for 37.4 percent of the total number of industrial and commercial households. In small towns closer to rural areas, the proportion of handicrafts is even greater. In the seven counties of the Fu'an Special District, the number of handicraft households accounts for 46.6 percent of the total number of industrial and commercial households. In Nanyu Town, Minhou County, the number of handicraft households accounts for 66.5 percent of the total number of industrial and commercial households.

Handicraft industry is closely related to agricultural production. The raw materials needed by the handicraft industry are mostly supplied by rural areas, and the products are mostly sold to rural areas. Farmers' local and special products also often require handicraft processing. According to a survey in Minhou Special District: 75 percent of the raw materials for handicrafts come from rural areas, and 77 percent of the products are sold to rural areas. In Xixia Village, Jingxi Township, Minhou No.7 district, handicraft products account for about 70 percent of the production materials and daily necessities purchased by farmers.

Since liberation, the handicraft industries in various regions that supply the daily necessities for the production and lives of the broad masses in urban and rural areas have all developed to varying degrees, and some products are still in short supply in the market. Only a very small number of handicrafts that do not meet the needs of the people and are crudely made have experienced surplus and backlog phenomena. According to a survey in Quanzhou City, among the city's 1,248 handicraft households, 971 can maintain production and operation, and 251 can currently develop further. The sum of the preceding two categories accounts for approximately 97 percent of the total number of handicraft households in the city, while only 26 handicraft households have no prospects for development and cannot be sustained, accounting for approximately 3 percent of the total number of handicraft households.

The main problems in handicraft production discovered in the surveys in various regions are:

First, the problem of production and sales. Most handicraft households have a shortage of capital. Therefore, they cannot purchase the raw materials needed for production during the peak season directly from the production areas and rely on merchants for supply. When it is difficult to sell products during the off-season, they have to rely on merchants for sales, and are thus severely exploited by the merchants. Some small umbrella shops in Fuzhou City have financial difficulties, and often sell finished products at low prices to larger shops in the same industry for resale, and then buy in high-priced semi-finished products from other shops for reprocessing, forming a commercial exploitation relationship within the same industry. Many handicraft owners cannot sell their products in the off-season, but during the peak season, products are often in short supply and there is often a shortage of raw materials, resulting in extremely unbalanced production between peak and off-seasons, and excessively large differences in supply and demand. The line noodle industry in Minhou County cannot work for even half a month in a month during the off-season; during the peak season, they can sell as much as they can make. For the knitted products in Xiamen City, the ratio of supply to demand during the peak season is "one supply to three demands"; during the off-season, it is "three productions to one sale." Because of the large seasonal fluctuations in the production and sales of handicrafts, some handicraft workers "earn money in the peak season and spend it in the off-season," taking the opportunity to cut corners and produce crudely during the peak season. Because handicraft workers cut corners in Jianyang local paper production during the peak season, reducing the weight of each piece of paper from 15 catties to 12 catties, sales have become difficult. At the same time, the decentralized operation of handicraft production, conservative and backward technology, and high production costs directly affect the quality and sales of products. Zhangzhou homespun cloth, woven on the same loom by the same person, varies in density; in the same shop, the same cloth number varies in weight and specifications. In addition, in individual regions, blind development in individual industries has led to overproduction, which has also affected sales.

Second, labor-capital, employment, and apprenticeship relations in the handicraft industry are not well-coordinated. The main problem is that in the past, some employment and apprenticeship relations that were not labor-capital relations were treated as labor-capital relations, which increased many unnecessary disputes. According to a survey in Jianyang County, among the county's 215 handicraft households, only eight have labor-capital relations, accounting for 3.72 percent of the total number of households; 19 have employment relations, accounting for 8.83 percent of the total number of households; only six have apprenticeship relations, accounting for 2.8 percent of the total number of households; and 182 are independent laborers, accounting for 84.65 percent of the total number of households. Surveys in other places also show that the proportion of real labor-capital relations in the handicraft industry is very small. In the past, various regions also lacked necessary education for handicraft workers, and leadership in handicraft work was weak. As a result, some handicraft workers had low confidence in production and operation, and illegal acts of abuse of workers and apprentices were not promptly stopped. Some individual workers and apprentices also lacked sufficient understanding of the prospects and roles of handicrafts, and had lax labor discipline, which affected production and the establishment of normal relations.

Regarding the leadership of handicraft production, the industrial and commercial departments, labor departments, cooperatives, trade unions, banks, and other departments in various regions are both in charge and not in charge, so many problems existing in the handicraft industry cannot be solved. For example, some small itinerant handicrafts in Jianyang are under "three no managements": the government does not manage them (because the household registration is temporary), the trade union does not manage them (because the workers have not joined the trade union), and the Federation of Industry and Commerce does not manage them (because the handicraft owners have not joined the Federation of Industry and Commerce). As a result, many problems in the handicraft industry cannot be well solved.

After initially investigating and studying the situation and existing problems in handicraft production, various regions have mostly put forward preliminary opinions on how to lead handicraft production in the future. These opinions can be summarized as follows:

First, the Party committees and governments must strengthen unified leadership over handicraft production. The Nanping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided that a county committee member will be responsible for controlling the handicraft industry. The Sha County People's Government has decided that in the future, it will regularly pay attention to understanding the situation of the handicraft industry, regularly study the problems in handicraft production, and take leading handicraft production as an important task. Fuqing County has established a handicraft industry working committee composed of relevant departments to specifically lead the handicraft industry. The relevant departments of the Zhangzhou City Industry and Commerce Department, Labor Department, General Trade Union, Cooperative, and Bank have jointly decided that in the future, they will closely cooperate in their approach to handicraft work, clarify the division of labor, overcome the past phenomenon of mutual disconnection and non-cooperation where everyone is in charge but no one is really in charge, adhere to the established departmental joint meeting system, and solve the problems existing in the handicraft industry in a timely manner. The industrial and commercial administrative departments should change the past laissez-faire attitude towards handicraft production and strengthen price management, business start-up and closure, and market situation surveys for handicrafts.

Second, according to needs and possibilities, actively maintain and appropriately support the handicraft industry, and help handicraft workers solve some of the difficulties in production and sales. Because the handicraft industry is closely related to agriculture, handicraft workers should be educated to face the countryside and serve the needs of agricultural production and farmers' lives. At the same time, handicraft workers should also be educated to improve their business practices, improve production technology, and strive to improve quality, reduce costs, and further open up sales channels. Zhangzhou City has also proposed specific methods: 1. Banks should appropriately relax the scale of loans to the handicraft industry, especially during the off-season. Through loans, assist handicraft workers in organizing temporary joint purchases and distribution, and joint production and sales, to gradually strengthen the connection and mutual assistance between small producers. 2. Tax collection should simplify procedures as much as possible, and more regular and fixed-amount collection methods should be adopted. 3. State-owned trading companies and cooperatives should appropriately help solve the difficulties in raw material supply and finished product sales as needed and as possible.

Third, labor-capital, employment, and apprenticeship relations in the handicraft industry must be properly handled under the principles of unity in production and mutual benefit for both labor and capital. The wages, benefits, and other issues of workers and apprentices should also be handled according to the principles of mutual benefit for labor and capital, and gradually and appropriately improving benefits with the development of production.

    福建省手工业的概况
    福建省福州、厦门、漳州、泉州等四个市，建阳、南平、福安、闽侯、晋江、龙溪、永安、龙岩等八个专区，建瓯、浦城、沙县、顺昌、福清、罗源、南安、惠安、仙游、同安、德化、宁德、莆田、海澄、东山等县及石码、涵江、石狮、南屿等集镇，从四月下旬开始，先后选择重点，有计划地进行了手工业调查工作。在调查中，初步了解了手工业的情况，研究和分析了手工业中存在的问题，同时，许多地区还初步提出了今后领导手工业生产的意见。
    福建省手工业在国民经济中占有很大的比重。据各专区、市的不完全材料统计，手工业生产总值约占全省国民经济的百分之十三，占工业生产总值百分之七十左右。福州、厦门、漳州、泉州四个市手工业共有一万零六百二十九户，占工商业总户数百分之三十七点四。在接近农村的小城镇，手工业所占比重更大，福安专区七个县的手工业户数占工商业总户数的百分之四十六点六，闽侯县南屿镇的手工业户数占工商业总户数的百分之六十六点五。
    手工业和农业生产有着极密切的联系。手工业需要的原料大多由农村供给，产品多销往农村，而农民的土特产品也多需要手工业加工。据闽侯专区调查：手工业的原料百分之七十五来自农村，产品百分之七十七销往农村；闽侯七区荆溪乡溪下村农民购买的生产资料和生活用品，手工业品约占百分之七十。
    解放后，各地供应城乡广大人民生产和生活必需品的手工业，都有了不同程度的发展，部分产品在市场上还供不应求；只有很少数不合人民需要和粗制滥造的手工业品，才有过剩和积压的现象。据泉州市的调查，该市手工业一千二百四十八户，其中有九百七十一户可以维持生产经营，有二百五十一户目前还可发展，以上两类合起来约占全市手工业总户数的百分之九十七；而没有发展前途和不能维持的手工业只有二十六户，占手工业总户数百分之三左右。
    各地在调查中发现的手工业生产中的主要问题是：
    第一、产销问题。手工业户大都资金短少，因此，旺季生产需要的原料，不能直接到产地采购，而依靠商人供应；淡季产品推销有困难，又不得不依靠商人推销，受到商人的严重剥削。福州市雨伞业有些小店资金困难，往往把成品低价卖给同行的大店转销出去，又向别家盘入高价的半成品进行再生产，形成同业间商业上的剥削关系。许多手工业主在淡季产品推销不出去，而在旺季，产品又往往供不应求，原料供应也常有不足，造成淡旺季生产极不平衡，供求量相差过大。闽侯县线面业在淡季一个月做不上半个月的工；在旺季可以做多少卖多少。厦门市针织业的产品，在旺季是“供一求三”；在淡季是“产三销一”。手工业因为产销季节性大，有些手工业者就“旺季赚钱淡季用”，在旺季时乘机偷工减料，粗制滥造。建阳土纸因手工业者在旺季时偷工减料，每件纸的重量由十五斤减到十二斤，这就使得销路发生困难。同时，手工业生产的经营分散，技术保守落后，生产成本高等等，也直接影响到产品的质量和销路。漳州土布，同一个织布机，同一个人织，织出来的土布疏密不一致；同一家店，同一号布，轻重规格不一样。此外，在个别地区有个别行业因盲目发展，造成生产品过剩，也影响到销路。
    第二、手工业中的劳资、雇佣关系、师徒关系不够协调。主要问题是过去曾把一部分不是劳资关系的雇佣、师徒关系当成劳资关系来处理，增加了许多不应有的纠纷。根据建阳县的调查，全县二百十五户手工业中，有劳资关系的只有八户，占总户数百分之三点七二；有雇佣关系的十九户，占总户数百分之八点八三；仅有师徒关系的六户，占总户数百分之二点八；独立劳动者一百八十二户，占总户数百分之八十四点六五。其他地方调查也说明手工业中真正的劳资关系所占比重很小。各地过去对手工业者也缺乏必要的教育，对手工业工作领导薄弱，因而有些手工业者生产经营信心不高，虐待工人、学徒的违法行为也没有及时受到制止；也有个别工人、学徒对手工业的前途和作用认识不足，劳动纪律松懈，影响生产，也影响正常关系的建立。
    在对手工业生产的领导上，各地工商科、劳动科、合作社、工会、银行等部门都管都不管，因此手工业中存在的许多问题都得不到解决。如建阳有些流动性的小手工业就是“三不管”：政府不管
    （户口是临时的）、工会不管（工人没参加工会）、工商联不管（手工业主没参加工商联）。结果，手工业中的许多问题就谈不上很好地解决了。
    各地在初步调查研究了手工业生产的情况和存在的问题后，大都提出了今后领导手工业生产的初步意见。这些意见归纳起来大体为：
    第一，党委和政府要加强对手工业生产的统一领导。中共南平县委会已决定由一个县委委员负责掌握手工业。沙县县人民政府决定今后要经常注意了解手工业情况，定期研究手工业生产中的问题，把领导手工业生产作为一项重要的工作。福清县已由各有关部门成立了手工业工作委员会，专门领导手工业。漳州市工商科、劳动科、总工会、合作社、银行等有关部门研究决定：今后在对待手工业工作上要密切联系，明确分工，克服过去都管都不管的互不联系、互不配合的现象，坚持已建立起来的部门联席会议制度，及时解决手工业中存在的问题。工商行政管理部门要改变过去对手工业生产放任自流的状况，加强对手工业的价格管理、开业停业和市场情况调查等工作。
    第二，根据需要和可能，积极地维持和适当扶植手工业，帮助手工业者解决某些产销上的困难问题。由于手工业和农业有密切的联系，所以应当教育手工业者面向农村，为农业生产和农民生活需要服务。同时，还应教育手工业者改善经营作风，改进生产技术，努力做到提高质量，降低成本，进一步打开销路。漳州市还提出具体办法：一、银行对手工业的贷款应适当放宽尺度，特别在淡季时要加以扶持。通过贷款，协助手工业者组织临时性的联购分销、分产联销等方式，逐步加强小生产者相互之间的联系与互助。二、税收应尽量简化手续，应多采取定期、定额征收的办法。三、国营贸易公司、合作社根据需要与可能，适当帮助解决原料供应和成品销售的困难。
    第三，手工业中的劳资、雇佣和师徒关系，必须在团结生产、劳资两利等原则下加以妥善的处理。对于工人、学徒的工资、福利等问题，也应该根据劳资两利、福利随着生产发展而逐步地适当地提高的原则来处理。        （摘自福建日报）
