Central Film Bureau Publishes Chinese Translation of "The Path to the Development and Prosperity of Japanese Cinema"

The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government recently published a Chinese translation of the book "The Path to the Development and Prosperity of Japanese Cinema." This book is a document published in 1952 by the Film Policy Committee of the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party. This document is an action program for Japanese cinema to fight for peace, democracy, and independence, and plays a decisive role in the development and prosperity of Japanese cinema. The document also fully exposes the conspiracy of American imperialism to destroy Japanese film enterprises and use films to enslave the Japanese people. The document is followed by four translated articles and thirty-two pictures collected by the editors, detailing the recent three years of progressive Japanese film activities. These articles and pictures illustrate that, under the specific leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, progressive Japanese cinema has become one of the powerful weapons for the Japanese people to fight against American imperialists and the Yoshida reactionary government; it is already an integral part of the mass just movement to strive for Japanese independence and defend world peace.

Jiangsu Film Education Work Team Goes Deep into Rural Areas for Screenings

The Film Education Work Team of the Jiangsu Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau recently formed thirty-one small teams to cooperate with the rural general election and the upcoming autumn harvest. Carrying films such as "Government Committee," "The Chinese Farmers Delegation's Visit to the Soviet Union," "Happy Life," "When the Grapes Are Ripe," "A Daughter's Marriage," and "Yiguan's Pernicious Way," they set off to screen in rural areas of southern and northern Jiangsu. The Film Education Work Team, learning from the experience of Soviet rural film projection teams, each team formulated a "Tour Work Route Schedule," gradually fixed screening areas and locations, and planned to enable farmers to see movies regularly. Due to the strengthening of planning in the screening work, the time for long-distance travel was reduced, and the number of screenings was increased. The Film Education Work Teams are equipped with amplification equipment, and during the breaks before the film screenings, they use popular speeches or clapper talks, ditties, and other forms to conduct propaganda with local production and central work as the content. Each team also carries slide projectors and other simple screening tools to cooperate with local cultural centers and stations to screen slides of scientific knowledge and real people and events on the local production front on rainy days or in small venues. This work has been widely welcomed by farmers.

From February to May of this year, the Film Education Work Team also organized twenty-seven small teams to tour and screen films in rural areas of thirty-six cities and counties throughout the province, showing more than 1,700 screenings, and more than 5.2 million farmers saw the films.

Sichuan Opera Thrives in Reform

Literary and art and opera workers in Chongqing are actively carrying out opera reform work, and Sichuan opera, the main local opera of Sichuan, is thriving and developing in a new direction.

At the National Opera Performance and Observation Conference last year, Sichuan opera artists won great praise from the audience with plays such as "The Story of Willow Shade," "Autumn River," and "Judging Snow and Identifying Traces." Afterwards, brother opera troupes in various places adapted and performed these plays one after another. Last year, Chongqing literary and art and opera workers sorted out and revised a total of twenty-three (fifty-seven acts) scripts; this year, they have revised more than twenty acts, and before November, they can complete the revision and trial performance of the three major scripts "Zha Mei An," "Baolian Lantern," and "Bian Fei Ji"; in addition, the revision of full-length operas such as "Red Plum Pavilion," "Jade Hairpin," "Mandarin Duck Tomb," and "Chain Scheme" is also underway.

Sichuan opera is one of China's many excellent opera types, with a long history and rich content, with about two thousand plays. In the past, it was only passed down orally by artists, and there were very few scripts, so many were lost. After collecting from various sources, a total of 692 plays have been collected so far, including 13 newly added ones and 49 (93 acts) that have been revised. There are 409 that are relatively good and can be staged after slight revisions. The revised scripts have been warmly welcomed by the audience. The Chongqing Xin Opera Theater staged "The Story of Willow Shade" 105 times in the first half of this year, with an audience of 110,000 people.

Shanxi Discovers Complete Cenozoic Vertebrate Skull Fossils

Fossil skulls of Cenozoic vertebrates such as Stegodon, Hipparion, Saber-toothed tiger, Kirin deer, rhinoceros, and bear have been discovered underground in Shanxi Province, with a degree of completeness that has never been seen before. These fossils of the earliest mammals from three or four million years ago are of great value for studying biological evolution and studying strata to explore the underground treasures of the motherland. According to investigations: Shanxi Province is richest in paleobiological fossils in Hequ, Baode, Xingxian, Yushe, Wuxiang, Qin County and other counties. In the past, farmers in Baode, Yushe and other places regarded fossils as "dragon bones," and dug up fossils to sell to medicine merchants as a sideline production. In order to protect national cultural relics, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government recently issued a notice to the people's governments at all levels under its jurisdiction to stop digging ancient animal fossils at will in various districts and villages.

Fudan University Biology Department Students Collected a Large Number of Specimens During Field Practice in Tianmu Mountain

At the end of June and the beginning of July, third-year students from the Biology Department of Fudan University, led by mycologist Wang Mingqi and entomologist Xin Jieliu and other teachers, conducted field practice in Tianmu Mountain, Zhejiang Province, and collected a large number of plant and insect specimens. After arriving at Tianmu Mountain, they were divided into higher plant, lower plant and insect groups to collect specimens. On Tianmu Mountain, 1,574 meters above sea level, the students set off to the dense jungle early in the morning. Students in the lower plant group traveled through the humid forest every day and found many valuable specimens. Students in the insect group used various methods to catch more than 5,000 insects of various kinds in ten days. Students in the higher plant group collected specimens of various trees and weeds on the mountain. Every time they collected a specimen, everyone discussed and determined its family and genus range. During the collection process, they found the world-famous tree Eucommia ulmoides, and saw the Chinese money plant with flat fruits. A large number of specimens were collected, and the lower plant group alone found 120 genera of fungi, about 250 species, a total of 412 specimen numbers.

    川剧在改革中欣欣向荣
    重庆市文艺和戏曲工作者积极地进行戏曲改革工作，四川的主要地方戏——川剧正在欣欣向荣地朝着新的方向发展。
    在去年全国戏曲观摩会演大会上，川剧艺人曾以“柳荫记”、“秋江”、“评雪辨踪”等剧目赢得观众很大的赞赏。以后各地兄弟剧种纷纷改编上演这几出戏。去年，重庆文艺、戏曲工作者共整理与修改了二十三个（五十七折）剧本；今年又修改了二十多折，在十一月以前可以完成“铡美案”、“宝莲灯”、“辨非记”三大剧本的修改和试演；此外对“红梅阁”、“玉簪记”、“鸳鸯塚”及“连环计”等整本大戏也正在着手修改。
    川剧是我国许多优秀剧种之一，具有悠久的历史和丰富的内容，剧目约有两千多个，过去只凭艺人口传，很少有剧本，所以失传的很多。经过多方搜集，到目前共搜集了剧目六百九十二个，其中新增加的十三个，已修改的四十九个（九十三折），比较优良和稍加修改即可上演的有四百零九个。修改过的剧本受到观众热烈欢迎。重庆市又新剧场今年上半年上演了“柳荫记”一百零五场，观众达十一万人。

    山西省地下发现了柱齿象、三趾马、剑齿虎、麒麟鹿、犀牛、熊等新生代古脊椎动物头骨化石，完整程度过去从未有过。这些三四百万年前最早的哺乳类动物的化石，对研究生物演化，研究地层以探索祖国地下宝藏有很大价值。据调查：山西省境内以河曲、保德、兴县、榆社、武乡、沁县等县古生物化石蕴藏最为丰富。而过去，保德、榆社等地农民把化石当做“龙骨”，以挖掘化石卖给药商当作副业生产。山西省人民政府为了保护国家文物，最近已对所属各级人民政府发出关于各区村停止随便挖掘古代动物化石的通知。

    复旦大学生物系三年级学生在菌类学专家王鸣岐、昆虫学专家忻介六等教师率领下，六月底到七月上旬在浙江省天目山进行野外实习，采集了大批植物和昆虫标本。他们到达天目山后，分成高等植物、低等植物和昆虫三组采集标本。在拔海一千五百七十四公尺的天目山上，学生们清早就向茂密的丛林进发。低等植物组的学生每天在潮湿的树林中穿行，找到了许多珍贵的标本。昆虫组的学生用各种方法在十天内捕到各种昆虫五千多只。高等植物组的学生在山上搜集各种树木野草标本。每次采到一种标本，大家就相互探讨，确定它的科属范围。在采集过程中，他们找到了世界有名的乔木连香树，看到了果实扁平的摇钱树。采集到很多标本，仅低等植物组就找到菌类一百二十属，约二百五十种，共四百十二号标本。
