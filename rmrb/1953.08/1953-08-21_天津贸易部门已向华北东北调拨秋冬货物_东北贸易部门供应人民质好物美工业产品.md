Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 19th: The Tianjin Municipal Trade Department has begun transferring autumn and winter goods to the vast urban and rural areas of North and Northeast China well in advance. Compared to last year, these goods are of better quality, greater in quantity, and more suited to the different needs of various regions.

In July, the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store Company and the Operating and Supply Department of the North China Cooperative Headquarters had already transported the first batches of thermal underwear, heavy-gauge socks, and wool socks to Chengde, Siping, Fushun, Anshan, Qiqihar, and Ulanhot. Transfers are continuing in August. This year, the thermal underwear supplied to Northeast China and Inner Mongolia is mostly the thickest size one. The colors of the thermal underwear are more varied than in previous years, and the styles include "sailor style," "turned-down collar," "zipper," "three-button," and "open-front" styles. The "zipper" and "open-front" thermal underwear are supplied to suit the habits of farmers and breastfeeding women. In August, the North China Cooperative Headquarters plans to increase the transfer of dark-colored fabrics to Northeast and North China by 50% compared to July. The Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the Printed Cotton Cloth Company transferred more than three times the amount of materials in July compared to the same period last year. The fabrics transferred to various regions include large floral broadcloth with new patterns such as "Peacock Displaying its Feathers" and "Mandarin Ducks Playing on Lotus Flowers." Due to the bright colors of these fabrics, the sales of Tianjin floral broadcloth have expanded from North and Northeast China to Northwest China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region this year.

To meet the needs of farmers in rural areas and pickle shops in towns and cities for a large amount of salt for pickling vegetables after the autumn harvest, the Tianjin Municipal Company of the China Salt Industry Company is transferring a large amount of Changlu salt to more than eighty salt wholesale points scattered throughout the North China region and parts of Central South China, including Kaifeng, Hankou, Changsha, Yuci, Taiyuan, Xinxiang, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou. The planned transfer quantity for the company in August is double the monthly average for the first half of the year. The Tianjin Wholesale Station of the China Petroleum Company, considering that farmers have more time for sideline production and spare-time literacy at night after the autumn harvest, and that the amount of oil used will increase, is transporting a large amount of kerosene to various regions. The amount of oil transported in July increased by nearly two times compared to the same period last year.

Due to the state's adjustment of the prices of some industrial products and the ratio between grain and cotton prices, the industrial products that farmers can buy are cheaper than in previous years. From the Tianjin market, comparing August this year with August last year, the price of Xinhua blue cloth has decreased by 3.3%; the price of Flight blue cloth has decreased by 4.3%. After the price of kerosene was reduced, the exchange volume of kerosene and various agricultural products has changed. For example, taking the Shijiazhuang area as an example, in the third quarter of last year, one jin of kerosene could be exchanged for 4.7 jin of millet, while in the same period this year, 3.41 jin of millet could be exchanged for one jin of kerosene.

Xinhua News Agency reports: The Northeast state-owned trade departments supply industrial products that are suitable for the people and are of high quality and low price.

Knitted goods, which are closely related to the lives of the people in urban and rural areas, have been supplied to the market in large quantities. There are hundreds of patterns and specifications of products, including dozens of beautiful, non-fading knitted goods suitable for women and children, as well as several types of Chinese-style underwear suitable for the habits of farmers, and thick thermal underwear and towel socks, which are essential for cold protection in Northeast China.

The enamel products produced by the Northeast Enamel Industry have improved in gloss and texture after the local state-owned enamel factory learned from advanced enamel factories in Guan Nei and the Changchun Institute of Science. The order contracts signed by state-owned commercial departments in various regions with the enamel factory at the end of the second quarter included more than 700,000 enamel washbasins alone.

Daily necessities with improved quality have also begun to be supplied in large quantities. Several types of toothpaste whose quality has been tested by scientific research institutions this year have been selling well in the market.

The knitted and enamel products pattern exhibition hosted by the Local Industry Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee has opened in Shenyang. After widely soliciting the opinions of consumers, the production departments will be urged to produce new products of better quality.

    天津贸易部门已向华北东北调拨秋冬货物
    东北贸易部门供应人民质好物美工业产品
   【新华社天津十九日电】天津市贸易部门供应华北、东北等地广大城乡人民的秋冬货物，已及早开始调向各地了。比起去年来，这些货物质量好，数量多，而且也比较切合各地不同的需要。
    七月份，中国百货公司天津采购供应站和华北合作总社经营供应处，已将首批绒衣绒裤、大线袜和绒袜等防寒衣着运到承德、四平、抚顺、鞍山、齐齐哈尔、乌兰浩特等地，八月份仍在源源调拨。今年供应东北和内蒙的绒衣绒裤，多是最厚的一号绒，绒衣颜色种类比往年增多，式样有“海式”、“反领”、“拉锁”、“三扣”、“开襟”等几种，其中“拉锁”、“开襟”等绒衣，是为了适合农民和哺乳农妇的习惯而供应的。八月份内，华北合作总社计划调东北、华北等地的深色布匹，比七月份增加百分之五十。花纱布公司天津采购供应站七月份调出的物资比去年同期增加了三倍以上。已调各地的布匹中，包括有“孔雀开屏”、“鸳鸯戏莲”等新花样的大花哔叽。由于这些布匹的色泽鲜艳，今年天津花哔叽的销路已由华北、东北扩大到西北和内蒙古自治区了。
    为满足秋后乡村农民和城镇酱园大量腌菜用盐的需要，中国盐业公司天津市公司正调运大批长芦盐到开封、汉口、长沙、榆次、太原、新乡、保定、张家口等散布在华北全区和中南部分地区的八十多个食盐批发处。该公司八月份的计划调出数量，比上半年每月平均数增加了一倍。中国石油公司天津批发站，考虑到秋后农闲，农民夜间副业生产和业余识字的时间增加，用油量增多，正把大批煤油运往各地。七月份运油量比去年同期增加了将近两倍。
    由于国家调整了一部分工业品价格和粮棉比价，各地农民所买到的工业品比往年更便宜了，从天津市场上看，今年八月和去年八月比较，新华青布的价格下降百分之三点三；飞行蓝布下降百分之四点三。在煤油价格降低以后，煤油与各种农产品的交换量已起了变化。如以石家庄地区为例，去年第三季一斤煤油折换四点七斤伏地小米，今年同时期内，三点四一斤小米就能换一斤煤油。
    据新华社讯：东北国营贸易部门供应适于人民质好物美的工业产品。
    和城乡人民生活关系极密切的针织品已大量供应市场。产品有几百种花样和规格，其中有几十种美观、不褪色，适合妇女和儿童使用的针织品，并包括几种适应农民习惯使用的中式内衣和东北防寒必备的厚绒衣、毛巾袜等。
    东北珐琅工业生产的珐琅产品，经过地方国营珐琅厂向关内先进珐琅厂和长春科学研究所分别学习后，光泽和磁质有了改进。各地国营商业部门第二季度末和珐琅厂签订的订货合同，仅珐琅面盆就有七十几万个。
    质量提高的日用品也开始大量供应。今年几种由科学研究机关检验过质量的牙膏，已在市上畅销。
    东北行政委员会地方工业局主持的针织、珐琅产品花样展览会已在沈阳开幕，在普遍征求消费者的意见后，将督促生产部门生产质量更好的新产品。
