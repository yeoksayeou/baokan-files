Xinhua News Agency, Bitong, 16th: A joint Red Cross team on the morning of the 15th met with twelve representatives of eight hundred and eighty American, British, French, Australian, Canadian, and Colombian prisoners of war at the Tiancang No. 3 POW Camp on the Yalu River. British Red Cross representative Mr. Jurome asked them, "Do you feel that the treatment you receive is in compliance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention?" The answer he received was affirmative - "Yes."

American POW Bangert, in answering a question from American Red Cross representative Scarborough, said: "We only have to get up, eat, and sleep at certain times. We are free to spend the rest of the day as we please. If you want to, you can sleep all day."

Mr. Jurome asked if the POWs had to do physical labor, such as building roads, and the POW representatives all shook their heads. American POW Corsin said: "The labor we do in the POW camp is all for our own benefit, such as going to the POW camp headquarters about half a mile away to collect our rations."

Corsin also told the joint Red Cross team that the POWs could visit friends in other barracks on Sundays and could freely communicate with their friends in the middle of each week. The POWs could send three letters home each month, one more than stipulated by the Geneva Convention.

Danish representative Dr. Nelson Megerld asked Bangert, "Do you like the food here?" Bangert, who works as a cook in the POW camp, told him that everyone here decides the menu themselves. He also said: "The food committee members of the POW squadrons go to each class to collect everyone's opinions on the food." He added that the quantity of carrots had been reduced, and the quantity of potatoes and canned beef had been increased.

Speaking of the POWs' cultural life, American POW Sec told the joint Red Cross team that they had quite a few American, French, Hawaiian, and Spanish music records. He said to the five Danish doctors in the team, "We even have records produced in Copenhagen." The POW camp representatives said that the POW camp authorities helped the POWs in every way possible to give them extensive reading opportunities. An American POW named Holland, who was previously illiterate, is now able to read newspapers without difficulty thanks to the help of a Chinese People's Volunteer Army staff member who can speak English.

American POW Corsin told the joint Red Cross team: "The POW camp authorities provide us with New Testaments, candles, crosses, and veils so that we can hold religious services."

The POW representatives' answers proved that the POWs received very good medical care during their captivity. American Red Cross representative William Sandy asked:

"Is there any dental equipment?" American POW Battdorff replied: "There is a dental clinic in the Bitong General Hospital, and a dentist comes to all the barracks regularly to see patients. He was here last month."

The area where this barrack is located was bombed and strafed by American planes last autumn. Danish doctor Nelson Megerld wanted to know if the POW camp had clearly marked POW camp signs to prevent bombing. American POW Yanda told him: "Each barrack has clear signs, and the POW camp management sounds a siren to notify us to prevent air raids."

As the meeting was coming to an end, the South Korean representative asked a series of questions. He asked: "Have any of you made statements calling for peace? Through what channels? To whom were they made?" POW Bangert immediately told him: "Everyone here wants peace. You can easily see this in every POW's letter to his family and friends."

Mr. Jurome, the chief representative of the United Nations side of the joint Red Cross team, finally said that the United Nations Red Cross personnel would no longer ask questions, and the meeting ended.

In the afternoon, the Red Cross representatives inspected the barracks and carefully examined the welfare facilities of an American POW squadron. They spoke freely with the POWs. These POWs will be welcomed back by a grand farewell banquet organized by the POW camp authorities tomorrow before they are repatriated. Danish representative Paul Kirkett P. saw that there was barbed wire around a small tomato field planted by the POWs, and said, "This is the only barbed wire I have seen inside the barracks."

    联合红十字会小组在我方田仓第三战俘营接见战俘代表
    战俘代表承认我方待遇符合日内瓦公约
    【新华社碧潼十六日电】联合红十字会小组十五日上午在鸭绿江边田仓第三战俘营接见八百八十名美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、加拿大与哥伦比亚战俘的十二个代表。英国红十字会代表朱洛姆问他们：“你们觉得你们所受的待遇是符合于日内瓦公约上的规定的吗？”他所得到的答复是肯定的——“是的”。
    美国战俘班格特在回答美国红十字会代表斯卡布鲁的问题时说：“我们只是必须在一定的时间起床，吃饭和睡觉。其余一天的时间都由我们自由支配。假若你高兴的话，你可以睡上一整天。”
    朱洛姆问到战俘们是否要做体力劳动，譬如说是否要修筑公路，战俘代表们都摇摇头。美国战俘柯辛说：“我们在战俘营里所做的劳动都是对我们自己有好处的，譬如到距离约有半英里以外的战俘营总部去领我们的口粮。”
    柯辛还告诉联合红十字会小组说，战俘们可以在星期日到其他的营房里去看朋友，还可以在每一星期中间和他们的好友们自由地通讯。战俘们每月可以发三封家信，这比日内瓦公约上规定的还多一封。
    丹麦代表奈尔逊·梅格尔德医生问班格特说：“你喜欢这里的伙食吗？”在战俘营中担任炊事员的班格特告诉他说，这里大家自己决定菜单。他又说：“战俘中队的伙食委员会委员到各班去收集大家对伙食的意见。”他又说，胡萝卜的数量减少了，土豆与罐头牛肉的数量增加了。
    谈到战俘们的文化生活时，美国战俘塞克对联合红十字会小组说，他们有相当多的美国、法国、夏威夷与西班牙音乐唱片。他对小组中的五个丹麦医生说：“我们甚至有哥本哈根出品的唱片。”战俘营代表说，战俘营当局以一切办法帮助战俘，使他们有广泛的阅读机会。一个名叫霍兰德的美国战俘以前是文盲，由于一位能讲英语的中国人民志愿军工作人员的帮助，他现在已能够毫不费力地看报了。
    美国战俘柯辛对联合红十字会小组说：“战俘营当局供给我们新约圣经、蜡烛、十字架与布幔，使我们能够举行宗教礼拜。”
    战俘代表的回答证明了战俘们在被俘期间获得很好的医疗。美国红十字会代表威廉·桑迪问道：
    “有没有牙科设备？”美国战俘巴特多尔夫回答说：“在碧潼的全科医院中有一个牙科诊所，一位牙科医生定期到所有营房里来看病。上个月他还到这里来过。”
    这个营房所在的地区在去年秋天曾经遭到美国飞机的轰炸与扫射，丹麦医生奈尔逊·梅格尔德想要知道这个战俘营是否有预防轰炸而明白标出的战俘营标志。美国战俘杨达告诉他说：“每个营房都有清楚的标志，战俘营管理人员拉警笛通知我们预防空袭。”
    在接见会将告结束时，南朝鲜代表发出了一连串问题。他问道：“你们中有任何人发表过要求和平的声明吗？通过什么途径？向谁发表的？”战俘班格特立即告诉他说：“我们这里每一个人都要求和平。你可以很容易在每一个战俘给他家里和给朋友的信中看出这一点。”
    联合红十字会小组联合国方面的首席代表朱洛姆最后说，联合国红十字会人员不再提出问题，接见即告结束。
    在下午，红十字会的代表们视察了营房并仔细地检查了一个美国战俘中队的福利设备。他们和战俘们自由谈话。这些战俘明天将由战俘营当局筹设一个盛大的欢送宴会来欢送他们被遣返。丹麦代表保罗·克基特普看见在战俘们种的一小块蕃茄地周围架设有铁丝网，他说，“这是我在营房里面所看见的唯一的铁丝网。”
