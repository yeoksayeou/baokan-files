    Xinjiang Provincial People's Government
    Supplies Pastoral Production Tools to Herdsmen
    To improve production in pastoral areas this autumn, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government recently supplied a batch of pastoral production tools to herdsmen. These production tools include thirty mowing machines, one thousand long-handled bow-shaped grass-cutting scythes, and five thousand wool shears. These production tools have now been transported or will be transported to pastoral areas such as Yili, Tacheng, and Dihua. Herdsmen have begun cutting and storing winter grass.
    The pastoral production tools supplied by the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government to herdsmen are all improved new tools suitable for the habits of the herdsmen, and are therefore welcomed by herdsmen of all ethnic groups. After receiving the first batch of one hundred scythes, the herdsmen on the grassland of Zhenxi County immediately sent a telegram requesting a further supply of two hundred.
    In addition, more than 2,000 hunting rifles and other tools purchased in the interior with a livestock protection loan of 4.3 billion yuan by the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government are also being transported to pastoral areas. This batch of tools is for hunters among herdsmen of all ethnic groups to hunt wolves, eliminate pests, and protect livestock. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆省人民政府
    向牧民供应牧业生产工具
    为做好秋季牧区的生产，新疆省人民政府最近向牧民供应了一批牧业生产工具。这些生产工具包括三十台打草机、一千把长把弓形割草用的扇镰和五千把羊毛剪子。现在这些生产工具已经运送到或将送到伊犁、塔城、迪化等地牧区。牧民们已开始割储冬草。
    新疆省人民政府供应给牧民的牧业生产工具，都是适合于牧民习惯的经过改良的新工具，因此受到各族牧民的欢迎。镇西县草原上的牧民得到第一批一百把扇镰后，立即打电报要求再供应二百把。
    此外，新疆省人民政府以四十三亿元的保畜贷款，在内地购买的两千多枝猎枪和其他工具，也正运往牧区。这批工具是供各族牧民中的猎枪手，打狼除害，保护牲畜的。（新华社）
