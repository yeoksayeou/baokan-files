Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 23rd:

Respected Prime Minister, Respected Deputy Prime Ministers, Representatives of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic:

Please allow me to express my respect to you and, through you, to the German people, and to wish you decisive achievements in building a peace-loving and democratic Germany and in reconstructing the national unity of your motherland.

We have already discussed, in a truly friendly atmosphere, mutually understanding and friendly issues of extreme importance for European peace and for strengthening the relations between our two peoples. This discussion demonstrated a full consensus of opinion and has led to important decisions.

We believe that the whole world will pay close attention to our sincere desire to ensure a peaceful resolution of the German question, and to the new steps we are taking together with you to help the German people resolutely embark on the path of peaceful development and realize their national aspirations.

Germany is now at the most critical stage in its history.

International reactionary forces, colluding with the current Bonn government, are stubbornly pursuing a policy that threatens Germany's survival as a unified and independent state. They are attempting to permanently divide Germany, turn West Germany into a dependency of monopoly capitalists from across the ocean, and revive German militarism to realize their aggressive plans.

The aggressors' conspiracy is not only against the German people but also against European peace. Therefore, it is natural for peace-loving people to link the German question with the issue of European security, and thus with the issue of international security. Peace-loving people of all countries are intensifying the struggle to avoid another war and to defend the vital interests of the peoples of Europe, including the German people.

Survival requires the German people to take a clear stand in this struggle and to express their strong opinions.

The German people are facing a historic task—to thwart the plans of the aggressive forces, rebuild their national unity, and transform Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country. Because only peaceful development can bring Germany unity, freedom, independence, and national rejuvenation.

The question now is this: Will Germany become one of the most important factors in strengthening European peace and security, or will it become the main European hotbed of new aggression?

Which of these two possible futures will the German people choose?

Which path will they take? The path of peace or the path of war, the path of national unity or the path of dividing Germany?

People of all countries cannot help but learn from their own historical experiences. Naturally, this also fully applies to the German people, who have had a grim life experience. What is the main lesson for the German people to learn from the entire evolution of Germany in the first half of the twentieth century?

The lesson is that the path of militarist aggression and war is the path of national suicide for Germany.

If we look at the period from 1900 to 1945, we can see that in those 45 years, Germany spent at least 20 years intensively preparing for two world wars, and more than 10 years fighting these two wars.

Therefore, in this entire half-century, war was the complete life of Germany from beginning to end.

What was the result? Following the national disaster of 1918, there was the immeasurably greater national disaster of 1945.

Due to the war plans imposed on the German people by the militarists, nearly eight million Germans paid with their lives. As for the disabled and wounded, they are countless. Figures from the German Association of the Disabled cited by German newspapers indicate that of every hundred Germans born in 1924, twenty-five died or went missing, thirty-one were seriously injured, five were wounded, and two were disabled. Two generations of German youth were destroyed or crippled in the great slaughter of war. Therefore, history teaches us that German militarism, while undermining the peace and security of European countries, is also the gravedigger of the German nation itself.

Nevertheless, the aggressors are again trying to drag Germany onto the old path of war adventure.

No disguise can conceal the true desire of the Adenauer clique, which represents the General Staff of West German militarism and revanchism and is leading Germany to another war.

For this sinister purpose, the German militarists are deepening the division of Germany and stirring up mutual hatred among Germans.

For this purpose, they are turning West Germany into a weapon of the aggressive policies of the North Atlantic bloc.

For this purpose, they have bound the hands and feet of West Germany with the so-called "Bonn Treaty." For the German people, this treaty imposes obligations even heavier than those imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, and humiliations greater than those of the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles did not divide Germany; it stipulated a partial occupation of Germany for fifteen years, which is a matter of record. The "Bonn Treaty," however, divides Germany, turns West Germany into a foreign vassal province, and legalizes the occupation of the entire West Germany for fifty years.

Germany still has no peace treaty, and the responsibility lies with the Adenauer government, which is unwilling to resolve the German question peacefully.

The Bonn rulers are forcing Germany onto the path of war. They are again pitting Germans against the peoples of Western and Eastern Europe. For the German people, this policy is fraught with the same consequences as the policies of the Hitler group. Humanity has already condemned the ringleaders of this group as war criminals. But isn't Adenauer and his gang following in their footsteps?

Will German mothers watch silently as the militarists prepare another, even more brutal slaughter for their children? Will German youth willingly become slaves, bleeding to feed the war machine of the American aggressor bloc? Will upright German patriotic people allow the militarists to isolate West Germany from the peace-loving people of all countries? Will they allow them to launch a war of aggression that is bound to arouse the great indignation of the people of all countries, turn West Germany into a region of war and destruction, and ultimately lead to the greatest tragedy for the German people?

If the entire German people are willing to peacefully resolve the German question, no aggressive force, whether from across the ocean or from Europe, can obstruct the realization of this noble aspiration. The fate of Germany is in the hands of the German people.

We know that tremendous changes are taking place among the German people, and clear-headed German political leaders oppose the path of war and the path of reviving militarism. The best elements of the German people are struggling for peace in Germany and for the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany.

The German Democratic Republic has a responsibility to play a epoch-making role in the work of achieving this noble goal. The peace-loving people of all countries rightly see in the German Democratic Republic the development of a new Germany, a peaceful and laboring, democratic and progressive Germany.

Precisely because the German Democratic Republic is the bastion of all peace-loving forces in Germany, the Soviet Union believes it has an obligation to give it full support and assistance.

The German people now have the opportunity to create a new era in their history, an era of peaceful development and prosperity for Germany. Such a future is precisely what the best elements of Germany have been striving to pursue. The great Goethe dreamed of seeing a free land and a free people living in the brilliant light of astonishing progress.

Before the German people is unfolding the real prospect of peaceful coexistence with the people of the Soviet Union and France, Czechoslovakia and Poland, Britain and Belgium, and with the people of all countries.

For a long time, many of the achievements of Germans in intelligence and physical strength have been used by militarists to wage war. In an environment of peaceful development, the German people will use their highly developed industrial power, all scientific and technological achievements, and all creativity and ability to improve the living conditions of the people and to seek the progress of the country. Germany will be able to establish close economic relations with peace-loving countries, to obtain necessary markets, and to restore traditional trade relations with Eastern European countries and other countries. Only by taking this path can Germany regain its status as a great power and achieve a proper place among the countries of the world.

The time has come to guarantee the German people this possibility and to open the way to the reconstruction of Germany's national unity and the establishment of a democratic, peace-loving Germany. The Soviet Union will continue to insist on striving for the early victory of the just cause of the peace-loving people of Germany.

Cheers for the friendship between the Soviet people and the German people, which is conducive to world peace! Cheers for the health of the Government of the German Democratic Republic and Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl!

### 在招待德意志民主共和国政府代表团宴会上  马林科夫主席的演说

    在招待德意志民主共和国政府代表团宴会上
    马林科夫主席的演说敬爱的总理、敬爱的各位副总理、德意志民主共和国政府代表团各位代表：
    请允许我向你们，并通过你们向德国人民表示敬意，祝你们在建立一个爱好和平的民主德国、在重建你们祖国的国家统一方面获得决定性的成就。
    我们已经在真正友好的气氛中，共同讨论了对于欧洲和平、对于加强我们两国人民之间的关系极为重要的相互了解与友好问题。这次讨论表现了意见的充分一致，并已得出了重要的决定。
    我们相信，全世界将极为注意我们保证德国问题得到和平解决的真诚愿望，注意我们为帮助德国人民坚决地走上和平发展的道路并实现他们的民族愿望，而与你们一起采取的新步骤。
    德国现在正处于它历史上最紧要的阶段。
    国际反动势力正与现在的波恩政府串通一气，顽固地奉行威胁德国作为一个统一的、独立的国家而生存的政策。他们企图使德国永远分裂，变西德为大洋彼岸的垄断资本家的附属国，并复活德国军国主义，以实现他们的侵略计划。
    侵略者的阴谋不仅是反对德国人民的，同时也是反对欧洲和平的。因此，爱好和平的人民把德国问题与欧洲安全问题，因而也是与国际安全问题联系在一起是很自然的。各国爱好和平的人民正加紧斗争以避免另一次战争，保卫欧洲各国人民的切身利益，包括德国人民的利益。
    生存要求德国人民在这个斗争中采取明确的立场，并说出他们的有力的意见来。
    德国人民正面对着一个历史性的任务——破坏侵略势力的计划，重建他们的国家统一，变德国为一个爱好和平的民主国家。因为只有和平发展才能使德国得到统一、自由、独立与民族复兴。
    问题现在是这样的：德国或者是成为加强欧洲和平与安全的最重要的因素之一，或者是成为新侵略的主要欧洲温床。
    在这两个可能的前途中，德国人民打算选择那一个呢？
    他们打算走那条路呢？和平的道路还是战争的道路，全国统一的道路还是使德国分裂的道路呢？
    各国人民不能不从他们自己的历史经验中得到教训。自然，这也完全适用于有着冷酷的生活经历的德国人民。对于德国人民来说，从二十世纪前半期德国的整个演变中得到的主要教训是什么呢？
    教训是，军国主义侵略和战争的道路就是德国民族自杀的道路。
    如果我们把一九○○年到一九四五年这段时期来看一下，就可以看出，在这四十五年中，德国至少花了二十年来加紧地准备两次世界大战，花了十多年来进行这两次大战。
    因此，在这整个半世纪中，战争就是德国从头到尾的全部生活。
    结果如何呢？继一九一八年的民族灾难之后，又是一九四五年的无法衡量的更大的民族灾难。
    由于军国主义分子强加于德国人民的战争计划，几乎有八百万德国人付出了他们的生命。至于残废者和受伤者，更是不计其数。德国报纸引用的德国残废者联合会的数字表明，一九二四年出生的每一百个德国人中，有二十五人死亡或失踪，三十一人受重伤，五人受伤，两人残废。两代德国青年在战争的大屠杀中被毁灭或变成了残废。因此，历史教训我们，德国军国主义一方面破坏欧洲各国的和平与安全，同时也是德国民族自己的掘墓人。
    尽管如此，侵略者又在设法把德国拖上战争冒险的旧道路了。
    任何伪装都掩饰不了代表西德军国主义与复仇主义参谋本部，并把德国引向另一次战争的阿登纳集团的真正愿望。
    为了这个罪恶的目的，德国军国主义者正在加深德国的分裂，在德国人之间煽起相互的仇视。
    为了这个目的，他们正变西德为北大西洋集团侵略政策的武器。
    为了这个目的，他们以所谓“波恩条约”把西德的手足束缚起来。对于德国人民说来，这个条约比凡尔赛条约使他们承担的义务还要沉重、比凡尔赛条约给他们的羞辱还要大。凡尔赛条约并没有分割德国，它规定部分占领德国十五年，这是有案可查的事情。而“波恩条约”却分割了德国，把西德变成了一个外国的附庸省份，并法定占领整个西德五十年。
    德国到现在还没有和约，责任在阿登纳政府；它不愿意和平解决德国问题。
    波恩统治者强使德国走上了战争的道路。他们正再度使德国人来反对西欧以及东欧的人民。对德国人民来说，这种政策充满着希特勒集团的政策所曾带来的同样的后果。人类已判定这个集团的魁首为战犯。但是阿登纳和他的一帮人不是正在步他们的后尘吗？
    德国的母亲们会眼看着军国主义者为她们的子女准备另一次更残酷的屠杀而默不作声吗？德国青年会甘心做奴隶，为喂养美国侵略集团的战争机器而流血吗？正直的德国爱国人民会容许军国主义者使西德与各国爱好和平的人民隔绝吗？会容许他们发动势必引起各国人民的极大愤慨、变西德为战火与毁灭的地区、而最后造成德国人民的最大悲剧的侵略战争吗？
    如果全体德国人民愿使德国问题和平解决，任何侵略力量，无论是大洋彼岸的、还是欧洲的，都不能阻挠这个崇高愿望的实现。德国的命运掌握在德国人民手中。
    我们知道，德国人民中间正在发生巨大的变化，头脑清醒的德国政治领袖们反对战争的道路，反对复活军国主义的道路。德国人民中最优秀的分子正在为争取德国的和平，为建立一个统一的、爱好和平的、民主的德国而奋斗。
    德意志民主共和国有责任在达到这个崇高目标的工作中起划时代的作用。爱好和平的各国人民由德意志民主共和国正确地看到了一个新的德国，一个和平和劳动的、民主和进步的德国的发展。
    就是因为德意志民主共和国是全德国爱好和平力量的堡垒，苏联认为，有义务给它全力的支持和援助。
    德国人民现在已有可能创造他们的历史新纪元，一个德国和平发展和繁荣的纪元。德国的最优秀的分子一直在奋斗追求的正是这样一个未来。伟大的哥德梦想看到一个自由的国土，以及生活在惊人进步的灿烂光辉中的自由人民。
    在德国人民面前正在展开着与苏联和法国，捷克斯洛伐克和波兰，英国和比利时各国人民和平共处，与所有各国人民和平共处的真正前景。
    很久以来，德国人在智力和体力方面的许多成就都被军国主义者用来进行战争。在和平发展的环境中，德国人民将把他们高度发展的工业力量、所有科学和技术的成就、全部的创造力和能力用于改善人民的生活条件，用于谋求国家的进步。德国将能够与爱好和平的国家建立密切的经济关系，能够得到必要的市场，能够恢复与东欧国家以及其他国家的传统贸易关系。只有走这条道路，德国才能够重新成为一个大国，并在世界各国间取得一个适当的位置。
    保证给德国人民以这种可能性，打开重建德国的国家统一、建立一个民主的、爱好和平的德国的道路的时候已经来到了。苏联将继续为争取德国爱好和平人民的正义事业尽早获得胜利而坚持努力。
    为苏联人民与德国人民之间有利于世界和平的友谊而干杯。为德意志民主共和国政府和奥托·格罗提渥总理的健康而干杯。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科二十三日电）
