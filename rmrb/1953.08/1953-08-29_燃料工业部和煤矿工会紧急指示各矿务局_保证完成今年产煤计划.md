    [Reported by this newspaper] The Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union have jointly issued an urgent directive regarding current coal mine production work, requiring various mining bureaus to take emergency measures to guarantee the completion of this year's production plan. The directive points out that in the first half of 1953, national state-owned coal mines only completed 95% of the production plan, with quality and costs failing to meet the state plan, and accidents were also serious. Very few units nationwide completed the plan well; among mining bureaus with an annual output of over one million tons, only Jiaozuo and Beipiao completed their output, efficiency, and cost plans. In order to reverse the above-mentioned serious situation, the National Coal Mine Cadre Conference in June studied the reasons why various mines had not completed the state plan and decided to take measures to guarantee the completion of the plan. However, two months have passed, and the change in the situation has been very slow. In July, only 93.6% of the output plan was completed, and accidents showed an upward trend.
    The directive points out the main problems in current coal mine production work:
    I. Tunneling work is lagging behind, and there are insufficient coal extraction faces. Most leading cadres have insufficient understanding of the important position of tunneling work in coal mine production, have long neglected the leadership of tunneling work, and have neglected underground geological work. Moreover, they have not allocated appropriate manpower to seriously promote advanced experiences in rapid roadway development and other tunneling techniques. This has led to the current lagging of tunneling work. In the first half of 1953, various mines nationwide only completed 83.9% of the tunneling plan, of which the main roadways only completed 64.8%. Because the tunneling work has not been completed according to plan, not only has it directly affected the output of coal, but more seriously, it has resulted in a shortage of coal extraction faces or a lack of backup coal extraction faces in most mines nationwide. This is the main reason for the current failure to complete the production plan.
    II. Another reason affecting the completion of production tasks is the severity of accidents. The leaders of some bureaus and mines have adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards the policy of safe production, lack inspection and improvement measures for safe production conditions, and have not seriously implemented technical safety and operating procedures, resulting in frequent personal and mechanical and electrical accidents, which have damaged the labor enthusiasm and labor initiative of workers, and even caused production interruptions, affecting the completion of production tasks.
    III. The failure to seriously implement plan management has prevented production work from reaching the requirements of normal cyclical operations. This year, most mines lack operating plans for coal mining areas, and production scheduling is not flexible. According to statistics from the entire Northeast region from January to May, only 17.6% of coal extraction faces achieved normal cyclical operations, so that most mines cannot complete the production plan in a balanced manner.
    After the National Coal Mine Conference, some mining bureaus conscientiously implemented the spirit of the conference, mobilized the masses, transferred some management and technical cadres to strengthen grassroots organizations, and leading cadres went deep into the field to personally supervise and inspect, made detailed calculations, and promptly solved problems. The production situation has begun to improve. However, most mining bureaus only carried out general communication and deployment without mobilizing the masses, so the production situation has not improved significantly, and the output of individual mining bureaus has even shown a downward trend.
    The directive points out that the above situation shows that the key to the failure to reverse the current production situation in a timely manner lies in leadership. This is manifested in the insufficient understanding of the political and economic significance of the first annual plan of the Five-Year Plan by the leading cadres of some bureaus and mines, the lack of a sense of responsibility for completing the plan, the failure to rely on the masses, and the adoption of a bureaucratic attitude towards the leadership of production work. In order to reverse the current serious situation and victoriously complete the first annual plan of the Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to immediately correct various erroneous thoughts and work styles in leadership, mobilize all employees under the unified leadership of the Party, and take the following specific measures urgently:
    I. Immediately strengthen tunneling work: (1) Formulate a reasonable tunneling plan based on the current production task requirements and the status of coal extraction faces in various mines. It is required that 50 coal extraction faces be added nationwide in September, and most mines should achieve 6 to 10 months of coal reserves by the end of the year. Those mines with real difficulties must also achieve this requirement in the first quarter of next year. (2) Promote advanced experiences in tunneling work, increase the number of rapid tunneling teams, and strengthen the leadership of existing tunneling teams, seriously promoting the experiences of Ma Liuhai and Cui Guoshan in rapid roadway development and deep-hole operations, hollow blasting, and prefabricated sheds. It is required that the average daily advancement speed of roadway tunneling reach more than three meters. (3) Transfer some veteran workers to the tunneling faces and appropriately allocate some capable cadres to the tunneling teams to strengthen the leadership of tunneling work. Implement a piece-rate wage system for tunneling workers and implement an excess reward system. (4) Make full use of existing machinery and equipment, and provide the coal cars, materials, and power needed for tunneling faces in a timely manner to ensure the completion of the tunneling plan. (5) Improve tunneling design, strengthen underground geological work, and reduce the blindness of tunneling work. Improve roadway layout, appropriately extend the length of working faces and the distance between stone gates, to reduce the workload of up and down mountains, inclines, and small roadways, to reduce the tunneling rate and increase the coal reserve. For thin coal seams, full mining methods should be adopted as much as possible according to the conditions to remedy the current situation of lagging tunneling and insufficient working faces.
    II. The director, mine manager, and chief engineer of the mining bureau are naturally responsible for guaranteeing the completion of the production plan, guaranteeing quality, and guaranteeing safety work. In guaranteeing the completion of the production plan, it is necessary to carefully analyze accidents, implement regulations, and conscientiously implement the three major systems of shift handover and instruction books to reverse the trend of continued accident development. Currently, there are many mechanical and electrical accidents, which directly affect cyclical operations and the balanced production of mines. Therefore, the mechanical and electrical maintenance system must be implemented. At the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to quality, actively improve coal mining methods, strengthen coal preparation and gangue picking, establish a strict quality inspection and testing system, implement a reward and punishment system, and improve the quality of raw coal.
    III. It is necessary to adjust labor organization in a planned way according to the principle of professional division of labor, increase mining and tunneling workers, reduce surface workers and indirect workers, and make the work of mining and tunneling workers as fixed as possible. Strive to improve mine operating conditions, strengthen political work and discipline education among employees, so that employees consciously abide by labor discipline, improve attendance rates, and give full play to their high enthusiasm to ensure the smooth implementation of the operating plan.
    IV. Strengthen plan management. Formulate operating plans that meet the actual conditions of the mine, master the balance of mining and tunneling and production scheduling, establish a duty system, continuously supervise and inspect the implementation of the plan day and night, and promptly solve problems occurring in production. It is required that the average daily progress of existing coal extraction faces reach 1.6 meters, and in September, production plans must be completed on a daily basis.
    The directive finally pointed out that eight months have passed in 1953. In order to complete the annual production and increased production plan, the daily output of coal mines nationwide must increase by 22% from September compared to the average daily output before August. This task is arduous, but the time is short. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels must clearly understand the principle that the national plan is the law, and regard guaranteeing the completion of the national production and construction tasks as the central task that overrides everything else. The monthly operating plan of each mine and its related measures must be submitted to the employees for discussion, so that all employees clearly understand the tasks of their workshop and team. Each mining bureau must be urgently mobilized under the unified leadership of the Party, launch a production competition movement, vigorously promote advanced experiences, and strive to comprehensively complete the production plan, ensure quality, and reduce accidents.

    燃料工业部和煤矿工会紧急指示各矿务局
    保证完成今年产煤计划
    【本报讯】中央人民政府燃料工业部和中国煤矿工会全国委员会联合发出了对于当前煤矿生产工作的紧急指示，要求各矿务局采取紧急措施，保证完成今年的生产计划。指示指出：一九五三年上半年，全国国营煤矿只完成生产计划的百分之九十五，质量和成本都未完成国家计划，事故也很严重。全国完成计划较好的单位很少，年产百万吨以上的矿务局只有焦作、北票完成了产量、效率和成本计划。为了扭转上述严重局面，在六月全国煤矿干部会议上，研究了各矿没有完成国家计划的原因，决定采取保证完成计划的措施，但时间又过去了两个月，情况的改变却很缓慢，七月份只完成产量计划的百分之九十三点六，而且事故有上升趋势。
    指示指出了当前煤矿生产工作中的主要问题：
    一、掘进工作落后，回采工作面不足。大部分领导干部对掘进工作在煤矿生产中所占的重要地位认识不足，长期忽视对掘进工作的领导，忽视井下地质工作；而且没有适当配备力量，认真推广快速送道等各种掘进的先进经验。这就造成当前掘进工作的落后现象。一九五三年上半年全国各矿只完成掘进计划的百分之八十三点九，其中主要巷道，也只完成百分之六十四点八。由于掘进工作没有完成计划，不仅直接影响到煤的产量，更严重的是使全国大部矿山回采工作面不足，或者没有了备用的回采工作面。这是目前不能完成生产计划的主要原因。
    二、影响生产任务完成的另一原因是事故严重。某些局矿领导干部对安全生产的方针采取官僚主义态度，对安全生产的条件缺乏检查和改善措施，没有认真贯彻执行技术保安和操作规程，以致经常发生人身和机电事故，损害了职工的劳动热情和劳动积极性，甚至造成生产中断的现象，影响了生产任务的完成。
    三、没有认真贯彻执行计划管理，使生产工作不能达到正常的循环作业的要求。今年大部分矿井缺少采煤区的作业计划，生产调度不灵，据东北全区一至五月份的统计，达到正常循环作业的回采工作面仅占百分之十七点六，以致大部分矿井不能均衡地完成生产计划。
    全国煤矿会议后，部分矿务局认真贯彻了会议精神，发动了群众，抽调部分管理和技术干部充实了基层组织，领导干部深入现场，亲自督促检查，深摸细算，及时解决问题，生产情况已经开始好转。但大多数矿务局只是进行了一般的传达、布置，没有发动群众，因而生产情况没有显著的改进，个别矿务局产量且有下降的趋势。
    指示指出：上述情况说明了目前生产情况未能及时扭转的关键在于领导，这表现在某些局矿的领导干部，对必须完成五年计划的第一年度计划的政治和经济意义认识不足，缺乏完成计划的责任感，不依靠群众，对生产工作的领导采取了官僚主义的态度。为了扭转目前的严重情况，胜利地完成五年计划的第一年度计划，必须立即纠正领导上的各种错误思想和作风，在党的统一领导下，动员全体职工，紧急地采取下列具体措施：
    一、立即加强掘进工作：（1）根据各矿目前生产任务的要求及回采工作面的情况，制定合理的掘进计划。要求在九月份内，全国增加五十个回采工作面，大部分矿山年底要达到六至十个月的获得煤量，部分矿山确有困难者，亦必须于明年第一季度内达到这一要求。（2）推广掘进工作的先进经验，增加快速掘进队，并加强对现有掘进工作队的领导，认真推广马六孩、崔国山快速送道及深孔作业、空心爆破、预制棚子等经验，要求巷道掘进每日平均推进速度达到三公尺以上。（3）抽调部分老工人到掘进工作面，并适当配备一部分能力强的干部到掘进工作队，加强掘进工作的领导。推行掘进工的计件工资制，实行超额奖励制。（4）充分利用现有的机械设备，及时供给掘进工作面所需要的煤车、器材和动力等，保证完成掘进计划。（5）改进掘进设计，加强井下地质工作，减少掘进工作的盲目性。改进巷道布置，适当延长工作面的长度及石门间的距离，以减少上下山、顺槽及小巷道的掘进工作量，做到降低掘进率，增加获得量。对于薄煤层，应根据条件尽可能采用全面采煤法，以补救当前掘进落后、工作面不足的情况。
    二、矿务局长、矿长、主任工程师是保证完成生产计划、保证质量、保证安全工作的当然责任者。在保证完成生产计划中必须认真分析事故，贯彻规程，认真实行交接班、指示簿等三大制度，扭转事故继续发展的趋势。当前机电事故多，直接影响循环作业和矿井的均衡生产，因此机电检修制度必须贯彻执行。同时还必须重视质量，积极改进采煤方法，加强选煤和拣矸石的工作，建立严格的质量检查和化验制度，实行奖惩制度，提高原煤质量。
    三、必须根据专业分工的原则，有步骤地调整劳动组织，增加采掘工，减少地面工及间接工，使采掘工人的工作尽可能固定起来。努力改善矿井作业条件，加强政治工作和职工中的纪律教育，使职工在自觉的基础上遵守劳动纪律，提高出勤率，发挥高度的积极性，以保证作业计划的顺利执行。
    四、加强计划管理。制订切合矿井实际条件的作业计划，掌握采掘平衡和生产调度工作，建立值班制度，日夜不间断地监督和检查计划执行情况，及时解决生产中发生的问题。要求现有回采工作面平均日进度达到一点六公尺，九月份做到按日完成生产计划。
    指示最后指出，一九五三年已经过去了八个月，为了完成全年的生产和增产计划，从九月份起全国煤矿的日产量必须较八月份以前的平均日产量提高百分之二十二。这个任务是艰巨的，但时间是短促的，因此，各级领导干部必须明确认识国家计划即是法律的道理，把保证完成国家生产建设任务当成压倒一切的中心工作。各矿井的月作业计划及其有关的措施，必须交由职工讨论，使全体职工明确了解本车间本小组的任务。各矿务局必须在党的统一领导下，紧急动员起来，展开生产竞赛运动，大力推广先进经验，为全面地完成生产计划，保证质量，减少事故而奋斗。
