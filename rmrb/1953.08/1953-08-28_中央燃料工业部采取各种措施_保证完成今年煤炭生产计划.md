Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: The Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry is taking various measures to ensure the completion of the 1953 coal production plan. In addition to holding a coal mine production symposium on August 19th to further study and resolve existing problems in production, the Central Fuel Industry Ministry has also organized inspection teams, focusing on the Northeast, to go to various locations to inspect production conditions and assist in solving relevant technical difficulties.

Since the Second National Coal Mine Cadre Conference, the production situation in coal mines has gradually improved. In the North China region, the completion rate of the production plan in July increased from an average of 93.1% per month in the first half of the year to 97%. Among them, the completion rate of the plan in July for mining bureaus such as Kailuan, Datong, and Fengfeng has significantly changed compared to the first half of the year. In the East China and Central South regions, production has gradually reached equilibrium in the first half of August. However, nationwide, the completion of the production plan is still poor. The national average completion rate in July was only 93.6%. In particular, the Northeast region, which accounts for half of the country's output, only completed 91.9% of the July plan. The Fuxin, Hegang, Jixi, Fushun, and other mining bureaus with relatively large annual outputs have not completed their plans. After analyzing the various reasons for not completing the plan, the coal mine production symposium believed that the key problem was the weakness of tunneling work. The low efficiency and slow progress of tunneling led to a gradual reduction in the number of mining faces, which affected the completion of the production plan. In order to solve this key problem, Chen Yu, Minister of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry, and Xu Daben, Deputy Minister, made important instructions at the symposium. They demanded that all subordinate units improve their leadership methods and styles, mobilize the masses to launch a tunneling competition movement, improve tunneling efficiency, and make reasonable adjustments to the wages of tunneling workers, as well as establish a system of bonuses for exceeding quotas. In addition, important instructions were also given regarding coal mining and plan management. After the meeting, the Coal Mine Management Bureau has issued urgent instructions to major regions and mining bureaus in accordance with the basic spirit of the symposium, in order to implement them.

    中央燃料工业部采取各种措施
    保证完成今年煤炭生产计划
    【新华社二十六日讯】中央人民政府燃料工业部正采取各种措施，保证一九五三年煤炭生产计划的完成。中央燃料工业部除在八月十九日召开了煤矿生产座谈会，进一步研究解决生产中存在着的问题外，并组织了检查组以东北为重点分赴各地检查生产情况，协助解决有关技术上的困难问题。
    自第二次全国煤矿干部会议以后，煤矿的生产情况已逐渐好转。华北区七月份完成生产计划情况，已由上半年平均每月百分之九十三点一提高到百分之九十七，其中如开滦、大同、峰峰等矿务局七月份的完成计划情况比上半年有显著转变，华东、中南两区到八月上半月在生产上也逐渐达到均衡。但就全国来说完成生产计划还是很差，七月份全国平均完成计划只有百分之九十三点六，尤其是占全国产量二分之一的东北区只完成七月份计划的百分之九十一点九，年产量比较大的阜新、鹤岗、鸡西、抚顺等矿务局都没有完成计划。煤矿生产座谈会分析了没有完成计划的种种原因后，认为关键的问题就是掘进工作薄弱，掘进的效率低、进度慢，以致回采工作面逐渐减少，影响生产计划的完成。为了解决这一关键问题，中央人民政府燃料工业部部长陈郁和副部长徐达本在座谈会上做了重要指示，他们要求所属各单位改进领导方法和作风，发动群众展开掘进竞赛运动，提高掘进效率，对于掘进工人的工资应作合理调整，并应订出超额奖励制度。另外，关于采煤和计划管理方面也做了重要指示。会后，煤矿管理总局已根据座谈会的基本精神，向各大区、各矿务局发出紧急指示，以求贯彻。
