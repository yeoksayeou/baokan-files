Prime Minister Grotewohl's Speech
The delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic expresses sincere gratitude to the Soviet Government and all the people of the Soviet Union for the warm and friendly reception and great care they have given to the delegation, and therefore to all the German people.

Tonight you have once again depicted how the German people's past has experienced national self-destruction. Our task is to ensure that the German people do not embark on a path of destruction for the third time. That is why we have come to you, to the camp of peace. During our stay here, the delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic, together with the Soviet Government, discussed issues of great importance to the German people as a whole: the need to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and to convene a peace conference for this purpose, to prepare a peaceful and democratic solution to the German question, with a view to ensuring the unification of Germany through free elections after the establishment of an all-German provisional government. In addition, suggestions made by the Soviet government to improve the economic and financial situation of the German Democratic Republic caused by the war and the division of Germany were also discussed. These issues are of vital concern to the German people, and the discussions proceeded very smoothly. The Government of the German Democratic Republic and all patriotic people in Germany see in the decisions of the Soviet Government the firm desire of the Soviet Government to promote the conclusion of a peace treaty. The Soviet government's proposal to reduce the burden on the whole of Germany, which has been immediately applied to the German Democratic Republic, is an irrefutable evidence to the whole world and to the whole of Germany that the Soviet government is determined to seek a final solution to the German question. The German people believe that the Soviet government's note to the Western countries on August 15 is a concrete proposal by the Soviet Union on a peaceful solution to the German question on a democratic basis. This note filled the hearts of all peace-loving people in Germany with joy and strength, because it pointed out the right path to restoring German unity and made it possible for the decisive stage of concluding a peace treaty with Germany to arrive at an early date. The Western imperialist countries—the United States, Britain, and France—do not recognize the German people's right to conclude a peace treaty. For this purpose, they argue that there is not yet an all-German government. After the Soviet government's note and our talks, this argument has completely lost its meaning.

We believe that the Soviet government's proposal to establish an all-German provisional government by the parliaments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany indicates that the German question can be resolved by two methods.

The claim that an all-German government does not yet exist is now self-defeating. If the Western occupying powers cease opposing the Soviet proposals, if the people of West Germany and East Germany reach an agreement, an all-German government can be established immediately. We believe that all the German people will support the proposals made by the Soviet Union to the Western countries and will demand the implementation of these proposals. We also believe that preventing the revival of German militarism and fascism promoted by the Bonn and Paris treaties is a matter of concern to Germany, its neighbors, and all peace-loving people. In order to prevent West Germany from becoming a militaristic country threatening peace in Europe, we will do our utmost to implement the will of the peace-loving and democratic forces in Germany.

Our talks and consultations have strengthened our unwavering conviction that the Soviet Union's views and proposals for resolving the German question are entirely based on respect for the rights and national dignity of the German people. Today, after eight years of division, Germany can end its division with reunification. This is in line with the German people's most ardent national struggle and aspirations.

The Soviet government's decision to grant economic assistance to the German Democratic Republic has demonstrated to all the German people the Soviet government's selfless and friendly support.

The consultations between the delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Government were conducted in a spirit of peace and friendship between peoples, and are conducive to strengthening and developing friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union. Every measure formulated and proposed by the Soviet government means practical help to us, which has brought fundamental relief to the people of the German Democratic Republic and helps us to convince our West German compatriots that the Soviet government is the best and most reliable friend of all the German people. The realization of this point will prompt the German people to stand on the side of the great Soviet Union and other countries in the great camp of peace, intensify the struggle for their national rights, and promote peace in Europe and peace in the world. That is why we want to once again express our heartfelt and unlimited gratitude to the Soviet Government and all the people of the Soviet Union. Long live the Soviet Government! Long live Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union! Forward, for the struggle for peace, progress, and democracy! (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd, TASS)

    格罗提渥总理的演说
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团热诚向苏联政府和苏联全体人民表示衷心的感激，感激他们给予代表团的，因此也就是给予全体德国人民的热情友好的接待和巨大的关怀。
    今天晚上你们再度描绘了德国人民的过去怎样经历了民族自我毁灭的情景。我们的任务就是要保证德国人民不再第三次走上招致毁灭的道路。这就是为什么我们到你们这里来，到和平阵营来的原因。在我们停留在这里的期间，德意志民主共和国政府代表团与苏联政府一起讨论了对于德国人民有着巨大重要性的全民族的问题：与德国缔结和约及为此目的而召开和平会议的必要性的问题，准备和平民主解决德国问题，以期在成立全德临时政府后通过举行自由选举而保证德国的统一的问题。此外，也讨论了苏联政府为改善战争和德国分裂所造成的德意志民主共和国的经济和财政状况而提出的建议。这些问题对于德国人民有着切身的关系，这些问题的讨论进行得十分顺利。德意志民主共和国政府以及德国所有的爱国人民从苏联政府的决定中看到了苏联政府想促进缔结和约的坚定愿望。苏联政府提出的减轻整个德国的负担的建议，立即用于德意志民主共和国了，这个事实对全世界和全德国说来，是一个无可置辩的证据，说明苏联政府决心求得德国问题的最后解决，德国人民认为，苏联政府八月十五日致西方国家的照会是苏联关于在民主基础上和平解决德国问题的具体建议。这个照会使德国所有爱好和平的人民心中充满了欢欣与力量，因为它指出了恢复德国统一的正确道路，并使缔结对德和约的决定性阶段可以早日到来。西方帝国主义国家——美国、英国、法国——不承认德国人民缔结和约的权利。为了这个目的，它们提出还没有一个全德政府。在苏联政府提出照会、在我们会谈之后，这样提已经完全失去意义了。
    我们认为，苏联政府关于由德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国议会成立一个全德临时政府的建议指明，可以通过两种方法来开始解决德国问题。
    说全德政府还不存在，这种提法现在已经不攻自破了。假如西方占领国家停止反对苏联建议的话，假如西德与东德的人民达成协议的话，一个全德政府立刻就能成立起来。我们相信，所有的德国人民将支持苏联向西方国家提出的建议，并将要求实现这些建议。我们还相信：防止波恩与巴黎条约所促成的德国军国主义与法西斯主义复活，是德国、它的邻邦，以及所有爱好和平人民所关心的。为了防止把西德变成一个威胁欧洲和平的军国主义国家，我们将尽最大力量来执行德国爱好和平的民主力量的意志。
    我们的会谈与会商已经加强了我们的不可动摇的信念，即苏联提出的解决德国问题的意见与建议完全是以对德国人民的权利与民族尊严的尊重为基础的。今天，在经过了八年的分裂以后，德国能够以重新统一来结束它的分裂了。这是符合于德国人民的最热切的全民族的奋斗与愿望的。
    苏联政府关于给予德意志民主共和国经济援助的决定向全体德国人民证明了苏联政府的大公无私的、友好的支持。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团与苏联政府之间的会商是在和平和各国人民友好的精神下进行的，是有助于加强和发展德意志民主共和国与苏联之间的友好关系的。苏联政府所制定与建议的每一项措施，都意味着对我们的实际帮助，使德意志民主共和国的人民感到了根本的宽舒，并有助于我们说服我们的西德同胞，使他们相信苏联政府是全体德国人民最好的、最可靠的朋友。对这一点的认识将促使德国人民站在伟大的苏联和伟大的和平阵营的其它国家的一边，加紧进行争取他们的民族权利的斗争，并促进欧洲和平与全世界的和平。这就是为什么我们要再一次向苏联政府以及苏联全体人民表示我们的衷心的、无限的感谢的原因。苏联政府万岁！苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志万岁！前进，为和平、进步与民主而斗争！（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科二十三日电）
