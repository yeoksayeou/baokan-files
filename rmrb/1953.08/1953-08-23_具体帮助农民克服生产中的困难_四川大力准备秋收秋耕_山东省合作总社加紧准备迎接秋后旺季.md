    [This article reports that] Party and government organs in various parts of Sichuan Province are actively leading farmers in organizing labor, solving specific problems such as shortages of agricultural tools and draught cattle, in preparation for the autumn harvest and autumn planting. This year, due to the promotion of advanced experience and mastery of agricultural seasons, further land processing has been carried out, so the maturity period of rice is relatively consistent. However, due to attacks by natural disasters such as autumn rains, the autumn harvest task is not only more arduous than in previous years, but also more urgent. In order to solve the difficulties of labor, agricultural tools, and draught cattle shortages faced by farmers during the autumn harvest, various localities have conducted typical investigations in advance. The investigation results in many areas prove that if the labor force is properly organized, it can basically meet the needs of the autumn harvest. To solve this problem, the following methods are generally adopted in various regions: First, organize labor based on the original mutual aid teams; second, restore and organize temporary exchange labor mutual aid teams. These are two main forms. For farmers who lack labor or have no labor, some districts have adopted the method of hiring people. Many areas have strengthened specific leadership over the original mutual aid teams. In mid-July, Luzhou Special District convened a representative meeting of mutual aid team leaders from the entire district to solve problems such as unequal mutual benefit, infringement of private property, and unreasonable work arrangements within the mutual aid teams. Various townships in Bishan County solved the problems of untimely work clearing and settlement, unreasonable work arrangements and labor allocation, and unreasonable work evaluation and wage calculation within the mutual aid teams, further promoting the preparation work for the autumn harvest. The mutual aid teams have also become more active. Restoring and organizing temporary mutual aid teams is an important method to solve the problem of labor shortage in the autumn harvest, and also an opportunity to educate farmers about "getting organized." Many areas have actively led this work based on farmers' original habits of exchanging labor and hiring people: actively promoting the policy of mutual assistance and cooperation, leading individual farmers to organize, and educating mutual aid team members to absorb individual farmers into the mutual aid teams. Many villages' difficulties in labor shortage have been solved in this way. If agricultural tools used for the autumn harvest are adjusted, they are generally sufficient, but due to the phenomenon of free use of agricultural tools in some areas, many agricultural tools have been damaged, and households with agricultural tools are unwilling to repair and replenish them. Therefore, the main problem in terms of agricultural tools is generally to repair the original ones, and some (mainly poor and hired peasants) need to replenish them; at the same time, there is a phenomenon of "incomplete sets of agricultural tools," so appropriate allocation must be carried out. When solving this problem, the policy of protecting farmers' ownership was generally promoted, and some phenomena of free use of agricultural tools and infringement of private property were corrected. After understanding the policy, farmers actively repaired and replenished agricultural tools. According to investigations in many places, there is still a shortage of draught cattle. Due to the phenomena of low cattle wages, wage arrears, and lack of care during use and feeding in renting draught cattle, some areas still have the phenomenon of cattle owners selling draught cattle and tenants not being able to rent draught cattle. While publicizing the policy of protecting farmers' ownership, farmers in some areas have cleared old wage arrears, appropriately adjusted rents, and formulated standards for human-cattle exchange labor, as well as methods for feeding and using draught cattle. However, this problem has not been completely solved yet, and all localities must pay attention to it. When solving the difficulties of shortage of agricultural tools and draught cattle, the People's Bank in some areas has timely issued loans. Cooperatives have also timely supplied agricultural tools for the autumn harvest.

    [This article reports that] The Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Office convened a meeting of directors of special district branches and city cooperative joint offices from July 22nd to 31st, focusing on deploying various tasks to welcome the post-autumn peak season.

    The meeting first summarized and inspected the material supply work in the first half of this year, specifically analyzed the new situation and characteristics of this year's post-autumn peak season, and conducted detailed discussions and research on how to prepare for and welcome the post-autumn peak season. The meeting believes that after the autumn harvest, various autumn crops will be on the market in large quantities, and farmers will exchange for a large number of autumn production materials and living materials; at the same time, the country's planned economic construction has already begun, and the large-scale investment in basic construction after the autumn will further increase the purchasing power in the market. In addition, this year the state has appropriately increased grain prices, lowered the prices of some industrial products, and narrowed the price gap between industrial and agricultural products, the actual purchasing power of farmers will be further improved. These new situations and characteristics will make the supply and marketing tasks of cooperatives more arduous and difficult than in previous years. Therefore, cooperatives at all levels must fully estimate and recognize the new situation and characteristics of this year's post-autumn peak season, resolutely prevent conservatism and empiricism in business operations, and quickly prepare to welcome the arrival of the peak season. According to the specific situation of this year's post-autumn peak season, the meeting determined that cooperatives throughout the province should give full play to the potential of cooperatives and vigorously carry out supply and marketing work based on the needs of members, farmers, and the state, as well as the cooperatives' own operating capabilities. In rural supply and marketing cooperatives, we should vigorously carry out procurement, fully conduct supply, expand the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and further implement the policy of "serving industrial and agricultural production and meeting the needs of members' lives"; in disaster-stricken areas, supply and marketing cooperatives should focus on organizing and leading disaster victims to help themselves through production. At the same time, we must improve business management through business activities, further change the style of business, and improve the quality of work. In terms of sales, in addition to the cooperatives in cotton and tobacco producing areas vigorously doing a good job in cotton and tobacco procurement, in terms of the scope of cooperatives throughout the province, grain procurement should be the focus of operation of cooperatives at all levels, and the task of national procurement of grain should be completed with the greatest efforts. At present, the focus is still on doing a good job in wheat procurement, accumulating wheat procurement experience, and timely carrying out autumn grain procurement business. The self-operated business of cooperatives at all levels should focus on the operation and organization of small local product exchanges, and pay special attention to promoting local products from mountainous and disaster-stricken areas. In terms of supply: Cooperatives at all levels should take active and effective measures to organize sources of goods and carry out necessary reserves to ensure the supply of materials during the peak season. In organizing purchases, we must actively organize and develop sources of local industrial and handicraft products, and take the initiative to strengthen contact with local industries and handicrafts. In carrying out material supply work, in addition to ensuring the supply of production materials during the autumn harvest and autumn planting, we should focus on supplying the living materials needed by members and the masses, and earnestly do a good job in the supply of grain and daily necessities. In order to do a good job in the autumn business, cooperatives at all levels should continue to implement the anti-bureaucracy struggle, strengthen investigation and research, conduct business alignment, and find out the purchasing and selling requirements of members and farmers to overcome blindness in operation; at the same time, cooperatives at all levels should summarize and check work, carry out criticism and self-criticism, sum up experience, commend good people and deeds, and set examples to educate cadres to further change the style of business and strengthen the technical guidance of procurement and supply work, to ensure that the procurement and supply work in this year's post-autumn peak season is done better.

    具体帮助农民克服生产中的困难
    四川大力准备秋收秋耕
    山东省合作总社加紧准备迎接秋后旺季
    【本报讯】四川省各地党政机关工作干部在准备秋收和秋耕工作中，积极领导农民组织劳动力，解决农具、耕牛不足等具体问题。今年各地由于推广了先进经验，掌握了农事季节，进一步作到了土地加工，因此水稻成熟期较一致，但因秋雨等自然灾害的袭击，秋收任务不但比往年繁重，而且时间也较往年紧迫。各地为了解决农民在秋收中劳力、农具、耕牛不足的困难，事先都作了典型调查。许多地区的调查结果证明：如果把劳动力妥善地组织起来，基本上可以满足秋收的需要。各地为了解决这个问题，一般都采取了以下几种办法：一、以原有互助组为基础组织劳动力；二、恢复和组织临时的换工互助组。这是两种主要形式。缺乏劳动力和没有劳动力的农民，有的区采取了请人的办法。许多地区加强了对原有互助组的具体领导。泸州专区于七月中旬召开了全区的互助组长代表会议，解决了互助组内不等价互利、侵犯私有财产、排工不合理等问题。璧山县各乡解决了互助组内清工结账不及时，排工、调配劳动力不合理，及评工计分、工资不合理的问题，进一步推动了秋收准备工作。互助组也活跃起来了。恢复和组织临时互助组，是解决秋收中劳动力不足问题的重要方法，也是向农民进行“组织起来”教育的机会。许多地区已根据农民原有的换工和请人习惯，积极领导这一工作：积极宣传互助合作政策，领导单干农民组织起来，并教育互助组员吸收单干农民参加到互助组中。许多乡村缺乏劳动力的困难，都是这样解决的。秋收用的农具如果经过调剂一般够用，但由于若干地区发生过无偿使用农具的现象，损坏了很多农具，有农具户也不愿修补添置。因此，农具方面的主要问题，一般是修补原有的，部分的（主要是贫雇农）需要添置；同时，在农具的占有上存在“锣起鼓不齐（即农具不全）”的现象，所以必须进行适当调配。在解决这一问题时，一般宣传了保护农民所有制的政策，纠正了一些无偿使用农具、侵犯私有财产的现象。农民在懂得政策后，都积极修补和添置农具。耕牛问题，据许多地方调查，目前仍缺乏耕牛。由于在租用耕牛上存在着牛工资过低、拖欠工资、使用和喂养时不爱惜等现象，到目前止，还有一些地区发生有牛户出卖耕牛，租牛户租不到耕牛的现象。在宣传保护农民所有制的政策的同时，有的地区的农民已清理了旧欠工资，适当调整了租金，并订出了人牛换工标准，及喂养、使用耕牛的办法。但目前这一问题还没有全部解决，各地必须引起重视。在解决农具和耕牛不足的困难时，部分地区人民银行已及时发放贷款。合作社也及时供应了秋收农具。
    【本报讯】山东省合作总社于七月二十二日至三十一日召开了全省专区分社及市合作社联合社主任会议，着重部署迎接秋后旺季的各项工作。
    会议首先总结检查了今年上半年物资供应工作，具体地分析了今年秋后旺季的新情况和特点，对如何准备、迎接秋后旺季进行了详细的讨论与研究。会议认为：秋收后，各种秋季作物将大量上市，农民将要换回大批秋季生产资料与生活资料；同时，国家有计划的经济建设业已开始，秋后基本建设的大批投资，将使市场上的购买力更加增加。加上今年国家适当提高了粮食价格，降低了部分工业品的价格，缩小了工农业产品差价，农民的实际购买力将更为提高。这些新情况和特点，将使合作社的供销任务比往年更加繁重和艰巨。因此各级合作社必须对今年秋后旺季的新情况和特点加以充分的估计和认识，坚决防止业务经营中的保守主义和经验主义，迅速作好准备，以迎接旺季的到来。会议根据今年秋后旺季的具体情况，确定全省合作社要根据社员、农民和国家需要及合作社自身经营能力，充分发挥合作社的潜在力，大力开展供销工作。在农村供销合作社应大力开展收购，充分进行供应，扩大城乡物资交流，进一步贯彻“为工农业生产和为社员生活需要服务”的方针；在灾区供销合作社应以组织和领导灾民生产自救为中心任务。同时，要通过业务活动，改善经营管理，进一步转变经营作风，提高工作质量。在推销业务方面，除了棉、菸产区的合作社要大力作好棉菸收购工作外，就全省合作社范围来说，应以粮食收购为各级合作社经营的重点，以最大努力完成国家采购粮食的任务。目前仍以作好小麦收购工作为重点，并积累小麦收购经验，及时开展秋粮收购业务。各级合作社的自营业务，应以经营和组织小土产交流为重点，并特别注意推销山区及灾区土产品。在供应方面：各级合作社应采取积极而有效的措施组织货源，进行必要的储备，以切实保证旺季物资供应。在组织进货中，要积极地组织与开辟地方工业及手工业产品的货源，主动地与地方工业和手工业加强联系。在开展物资供应工作中，除了在秋收秋种期间切实作好生产资料的供应外，应以供应社员、群众需要的生活资料为重点，切实作好粮食及日用百货的供应。为了搞好秋季业务，各级合作社应继续贯彻反官僚主义的斗争，加强调查研究，进行业务排队，摸清社员、农民的购销要求，以克服经营中的盲目性；同时各级合作社应通过总结检查工作，开展批评与自我批评，总结经验，表扬好人好事，树立榜样，以教育干部进一步转变经营作风，加强收购、供应工作的技术指导，保证把今年秋后旺季的收购、供应工作做得更好。
