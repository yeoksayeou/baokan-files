    Striving to Improve the Quality of Petroleum Products
    Liu Fang, Deputy Director of the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry
    Since liberation, China's natural petroleum processing plants and synthetic petroleum plants have successively resumed production, far exceeding the historical equipment utilization rate, and some new products have been added. However, due to the backwardness of the original petroleum extraction work and the low quality of various refining factories, the quality is inferior. Therefore, although the quality of domestic petroleum products improved somewhat in the early days of liberation, the problem was not fundamentally solved. For example, the gasoline in the Northwest has a very low octane number and large evaporation losses. The shale gasoline in the Northeast has high gum values and final boiling points. The kerosene in the Northwest is yellow in color, and when used in kerosene lamps, it stops drawing oil after burning half a pot; barrelled diesel oil cannot be poured out in winter; the freezing point of transformer oil can only reach minus five degrees Celsius, which is far from the requirements of users. In addition, poor transportation and storage also affect the quality of the products. This situation hinders national construction. If the engine oil is not good, it will be difficult to use the machines. If light diesel oil contains fine sand, it will easily wear out the diesel nozzles and oil pump cores. If the quality of diesel oil is not good, gelatinous sediments will occur after storage. These sediments make the filters of diesel vehicles easy to clog and must be replaced every two days.
    In 1951, state-owned petroleum factories began to pay attention to this issue and were determined to improve the quality of the products. In June 1951, petroleum factories in the Northeast began to establish a technical inspection system during the quality inspection campaign. Petroleum factories in the Northwest rectified their laboratories and established a three-shift inspection system for finished and semi-finished products to ensure that the quality of products and raw materials in each workshop met the factory's standards. Coupled with worker innovation and rationalization proposals, the quality of petroleum products was greatly improved. For example, employees of Petroleum Plant No. 1 took the initiative to study how to improve gasoline quality and proposed three technical improvement methods, which greatly reduced the gum value and final boiling point of gasoline and increased the octane number. The plant also improved the continuous kettle distillation operation and gave full play to the capabilities of the cold pressing workshop, and can produce three freezing points of light diesel oil at minus twenty degrees Celsius, minus ten degrees Celsius, and minus two degrees Celsius to supply different temperature regions in the country. Yumen Refinery adopted a rationalization proposal to add a secondary evaporation tower in the gasoline workshop to increase the octane number of gasoline. Petroleum Plant No. 10 carefully selected raw materials and improved operations, and recently can produce transformer oil with a freezing point of minus twenty-five degrees Celsius. Except for the stability period, which is yet to be studied, other specifications can meet the standards. In the trial production of new products, lubricating grease, high-speed ball bearing grease, and refrigerator oil have also made a certain foundation.
    Petroleum factories have also strengthened production technology management, brought into play the role of the technical inspection section and the laboratory, and improved the sense of responsibility of the staff of the technical inspection section and the laboratory to ensure that the petroleum products leaving the factory meet the specified standards. In the first quarter of this year, the laboratory of Yumen Refinery found that defective products had to be returned to the furnace for re-refining, and these defective products were not allowed to be put into the finished product tanks. The laboratory of the plant also closely cooperated with the workshop to check the quality of products and semi-finished products in the workshop, and put forward the slogan of "completing the plan shift by shift and ensuring quality," which greatly reduced the number of defective products. The phenomenon that the kerosene lamp does not draw oil after burning half a pot has been eliminated. The technical section of Petroleum Plant No. 1 has formulated a set of inspection standards for oil product quality with the production section. This standard is slightly higher than the factory standard. For example, the factory standard for the freezing point of summer shale light diesel oil is minus two degrees Celsius, while the standard controlled by the inspection section is minus three or minus four degrees Celsius. This reliably guarantees the quality of the products.
    Although petroleum factories have made great achievements in the struggle to improve product quality, there are still many problems that need to be solved. China's existing natural crude oil, shale oil, and synthetic crude oil are all paraffin-based crude oil. Various products contain more wax, so that the freezing point of the products (high-grade kerosene, diesel, fuel oil, lubricating oil) cannot be lowered very much, and cannot meet the needs of cold regions and special tasks. In addition, the characteristics of shale diesel products require timely storage and timely use. The acidity of diesel and engine oil refined from Yumen crude oil without cleaning is relatively high, and the iodine value of synthetic solvent gasoline is also high. Under the existing equipment conditions, these shortcomings can only be appropriately improved through the active efforts of workers and technicians, and it is also required that the use department increase heat-resistant devices in storage and transportation equipment and appropriately adjust the storage and transportation period to remedy these shortcomings.
    In terms of production technology management, there are also serious shortcomings. In the process of storage, transportation, and barrel filling, due to the lack of a proper inspection system and carelessness, qualified oil products become unqualified oil products. A petroleum plant spent a lot of sophisticated washing procedures to produce refined oil with a freezing point of minus twenty-five degrees Celsius, but it was placed in the open air. Rainwater entered the barrel, bringing many iron rust impurities into the oil, affecting the quality. The diesel oil newly produced by Petroleum Plant No. 1 is clean, but the quality of the oil is reduced because the oil tanks and oil tank trucks are dirty. The technical inspection sections of some factories and mines have adopted a compromise attitude towards the shortcomings in transportation. The staff of the technical inspection section found that the oil tank truck was not clean and refused to load the truck, but after hearing the opinion that the transportation task was busy and the truck could not be cleaned, they agreed to load the truck, which damaged the quality of the oil. Some factory technicians found that the oil tank truck was not clean, but as long as the other party signed or provided a guarantee, proving that the responsibility for damage to the oil quality after leaving the factory would be borne by the consignee, they would no longer care. This attitude of shirking responsibility must be strictly criticized and stopped. In addition, the quality inspection system of some factories is still not sound and cannot play its role. Due to insufficient scientific knowledge, some technical problems cannot be solved. For example, the question of whether light diesel oil needs to be washed at Yumen Refinery is a problem that has not been solved.
    In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry convened the National Petroleum Specifications Conference in late June, which adopted the "National Provisional Standards for Petroleum Product Specifications" and the "National Provisional Standards for Petroleum Product Testing Methods," including eight types of products such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel, fuel oil, solvent gasoline, lubricating oil, paraffin wax, and asphalt. The conference also discussed quality issues, put forward the direction of future efforts, and required all petroleum factories to first address the existing shortcomings of petroleum products, propose specific plans to improve quality, formulate technical measures, and find advanced refining methods to ensure product quality. Secondly, all petroleum factories must strengthen inspection work, unify testing methods, train cadres for laboratory work, establish a responsibility system, and ensure that the specifications of petroleum products leaving the factory fully comply with national standards; the factory director, chief engineer, and head of the technical inspection section are all responsible for ensuring the implementation of the "National Provisional Standards for Petroleum Product Specifications." In the past, some factories had technical inspection sections and inspection work, but they did not play a role. All petroleum factories must correct this phenomenon. In addition, all petroleum factories should actively contact scientific institutions and user departments. Scientific institutions should conduct engine tests and driving tests on domestic oil products to discover the advantages and disadvantages of petroleum products, inform petroleum factories, and urge petroleum factories to consolidate their advantages and improve their disadvantages. The user departments should pay attention to educating technicians and workers who use oil products, so that they can master scientific knowledge, pay attention to the maintenance of machinery, and pay attention to recording the results of oil product use, so as to serve as the basis for improving the quality of domestic oil products. Transportation and sales departments should try their best to maintain the original quality of qualified oil products and transfer them to users.

    为提高石油产品质量而斗争
    中央燃料工业部石油管理总局副局长  刘放
    解放以来，我国各天然石油加工工厂和人造石油工厂陆续恢复了生产，远远超过了历史上的设备运用率，并且增加了一些新产品。但是由于原有的石油开采工作和各炼油工厂技术落后，质量低劣。所以，解放初期，国产石油产品的质量虽然有所改进，还是没有根本解决问题。例如西北的汽油，辛烷值很低，蒸发损失也大。东北的页岩汽油，胶值和终沸点都很高。西北煤油颜色黄，用它点煤油灯燃烧到半壶，就不上油；桶装的柴油，到冬天就倾倒不出来；变压器油的凝固点只能达到摄氏负五度，距离使用者的要求很远。此外，运输和保管的不良，也影响了产品的质量。这种情况，对于国家建设是有妨碍的。因为机油不好，使用机器时会发生困难。轻柴油含有细砂，就容易磨损柴油嘴和油泵心子。柴油质量不好，储藏后发生胶状的沉淀物，这种沉淀物使柴油汽车的过滤器容易堵塞，必须每隔两天，更换一次过滤器。
    一九五一年，国营石油工厂就开始注意到这个问题，决心要改进产品的质量。一九五一年六月，东北各石油厂在质量大检查运动中，开始建立了技术检查制度。西北石油工厂整顿了试验室，建立了成品和半制品的三班检查制，保证各车间的产品和原料的质量合乎厂定的标准，加以工人的创造和合理化建议，大大提高了石油产品的质量。例如石油一厂的员工主动地研究了如何改善汽油品质的问题，提出了三项改进技术的办法，使汽油的胶值和终沸点大大降低，并提高了辛烷值。该厂还改善了连续釜蒸馏操作，充分发挥了冷榨车间的能力，可以生产摄氏负二十度、负十度和负二度三种凝固点的轻柴油，以供应国内各气温不同的地区使用。玉门炼油厂采用了在汽油车间增添二级蒸发塔的合理化建议，提高了汽油的辛烷值。石油十厂精选原料，改进操作，最近可以生产凝固点摄氏负二十五度的变压器油，除安定性年限尚待研究外，其他的规格都能合乎标准。在新产品试制中，润滑脂、高速滚珠润滑脂、冷冻机油等，也都有了一定的基础。
    各石油工厂还加强了生产技术管理，发挥了技术检查科和试验室的作用，提高了技术检查科和试验室工作人员的责任心，保证了出厂的石油产品合乎规定标准。今年第一季玉门炼油厂的试验室发现次品就要回炉重炼，不许把这些次品打到成品罐里去。该厂试验室还和车间取得密切的配合，检查车间产品和半制品的质量，提出了“班班完成计划、保证质量”的口号，大大减少了次品。消除了煤油灯燃烧到半壶不上油的现象。石油一厂技术科与生产科订立了一套油品质量的检查标准，这个标准稍高于出厂的标准。例如夏用页岩轻柴油凝固点的出厂标准为摄氏负二度，检查科控制的标准为摄氏负三度或负四度。这样就牢靠地保证了产品的质量。
    各石油工厂在提高产品质量的斗争中，虽有很大的成绩，但还有着不少问题，尚待解决。我国现有的天然原油、页岩油和合成原油，都是石蜡基的原油。各种产品含蜡较多，以致产品（高级煤油、柴油、燃料油、润滑油）的凝固点还不能降到很低，还不能满足寒冷地区和特殊任务的需要。另外页岩柴油制品的特点，要求适时储藏、适时使用，玉门原油炼制的未经清洗的柴油和机油的酸度都比较高，合成溶剂汽油的碘价也高。这些缺点，在现有的设备条件之下，还只能通过工人和技术人员的积极努力，来作适当的改善，并且还要求使用部门增加储运设备的防热装置，适当地调整储运期限，来补救这些缺点。
    在生产技术管理方面，也有着严重的缺点。在保管、运输和装桶的过程中，由于没有妥善的检查制度，疏忽大意，使得合格的油品变成为不合格的油品。一处石油厂花费许多精洗的手续，制成凝固点摄氏负二十五度的精洗油，却被放在露天里，雨水进入桶内，把许多铁锈杂质带进油里，影响了质量。石油一厂新生产的柴油是洁净的，但因为油罐脏、油槽车脏，降低了油的质量。有些厂矿的技术检查科对于运输方面的缺点，采取了妥协迁就的态度。技术检查科的工作人员发现了油槽车不干净，拒绝装车，但听说运输任务忙碌，不能清洗车等的意见后，又同意装车，结果损害了油的品质。有些工厂的技术人员，发现油槽车不清洁，但只要对方签字或打保条，证明油品出厂后污损的责任由提货者负责后，就不再过问了。这种推卸责任的工作态度，必须予以严格的批评和制止。此外，有些工厂检查质量的制度还不健全，还不能发挥作用。由于科学知识的不足，有些技术上的问题，不能得到解决。比如玉门炼油厂轻柴油是否需要洗的问题，就是一个没有解决的问题。
    为了解决上述这些问题，中央燃料工业部在六月下旬召开了全国石油规格会议，通过了包括汽油、煤油、柴油、燃料油、溶剂汽油、润滑油、石蜡、沥青等八种产品的“石油产品规格全国暂行标准”和“石油产品试验方法全国暂行标准”，讨论了质量方面的问题，提出了今后努力的方向，要求各石油工厂首先应该针对石油产品的已有的缺点，提出具体的改善质量的计划，拟出技术措施，找出先进的精炼方法，来保证产品的质量。其次，各石油工厂必须加强检验工作，统一试验方法，训练化验工作的干部，建立责任制度，保证出厂的石油规格完全符合国家的标准；厂长、总工程师和技术检查科长都有责任来保证“石油产品规格全国暂行标准”的实行。过去有些工厂虽然有技术检查科，有检验工作，但不发生作用，各石油工厂必须纠正这种现象。此外，各石油工厂应该主动地联系科学机关和使用部门。科学机关应该对国产油料进行引擎试验和行车试验，从而发现石油产品的优缺点，告诉各石油工厂，促使各石油工厂巩固优点，改进缺点。使用部门应该注意教育使用油品的技术员和工人，使他们掌握科学知识，注意机械的保养，注意记录油品使用的结果，以便作为改进国产油品质量的依据。运输和销售部门应该尽量使生产合格的油品保持原来的品质，转运到使用者的手中。
