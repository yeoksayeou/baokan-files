Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic in China, Johann Koenig, on behalf of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, sent a letter to Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, to congratulate him on the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Comrade Premier,

On behalf of Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, I would like to extend to you, Comrade Premier, the heartfelt congratulations of the German people on the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The German people are particularly able to appreciate the significance of the help given by the Chinese people to the heroic Korean people in their arduous struggle against imperialist aggression and for the achievement of an armistice for national self-determination and independence, because the German people have received the support of all peace-loving countries around the world, especially the great Soviet Union, in their struggle to achieve a peaceful solution to their own vital national problems. The conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a victory for the cause of peace throughout the world. This victory gives the patriotic people of Germany new strength and confidence in their struggle to establish a united, independent, democratic and peace-loving Germany and to conclude a peace treaty.

Please allow me, Comrade Premier, to reiterate my highest respect.

Johann Koenig
Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic in China with the rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary
August 1, 1953, in Beijing

    兹奉德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥之命，谨向您，总理同志，代表德国人民就朝鲜停战协定的签订表示由衷的祝贺。德国人民特别能体会到中国人民在英勇的朝鲜人民进行着为了民族自决和独立而抗拒帝国主义侵略以及争取达成停战的艰苦斗争中所给予的帮助的意义，因为德国人民在争取和平解决他们自己的民族切身问题的斗争中获得了全世界爱好和平的国家，特别是伟大的苏联的支援。朝鲜停战协定的达成是全世界争取和平事业的胜利。这一胜利给予德国的爱国人士在争取建立统一、独立、民主与爱好和平的德国及缔结和约的斗争中以新的力量和信心。
    请允许我，总理同志，借此重申最高的敬意。
