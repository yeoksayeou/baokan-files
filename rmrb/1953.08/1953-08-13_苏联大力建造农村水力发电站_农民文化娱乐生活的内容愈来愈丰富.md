Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 12th: The TASS news agency reports that this year, rural areas throughout the Soviet Union are vigorously building rural hydroelectric power stations. In the central Russian Federation, in the Rostov Oblast and Stavropol Krai, in the Urals and many other regions, many rural hydroelectric power stations with a generating capacity of 1,000 to 2,000 kilowatts are under construction. In the Central Asian republics, thousands of rural hydroelectric power stations have already been built or are under construction. Collective farms in the Tajik Republic have allocated more than 15.5 million rubles from their collective farm accumulation funds this year to finance the construction of hydroelectric power stations. After completion, these hydroelectric power stations will use local river water and local fuel resources to generate electricity. Recently, good news about the completion of new hydroelectric power stations has been constantly coming from all over the Soviet Union. The Ukrainian Republic has built 14 rural hydroelectric power stations this year, increasing the total number of rural hydroelectric power stations in the republic to 4,800. The number of electric motors in collective farms in the Ukrainian Republic has increased elevenfold compared to 1940. A newly built hydroelectric power station in the Stalin Collective Farm in Andijan Oblast, Uzbek Republic, has begun supplying electricity to the farm. The newly built hydroelectric power stations throughout the country send electricity to collective farm residences, fields, threshing grounds, and livestock breeding departments, electrifying and mechanizing rural life and work.

Many rural hydroelectric power stations newly built this year throughout the Soviet Union are jointly built by several collective farms. For example, a newly built rural hydroelectric power station on the Obul River in Vitebsk Oblast, Belarus Republic, can supply the electricity needed by ten collective farms and the district center. Rural hydroelectric power stations everywhere have applied the latest engineering achievements. In the Ukrainian Republic, many rural hydroelectric power stations have been converted to automatic control, which greatly reduces the number of personnel managing hydroelectric power stations in collective farms. Some places are working on combining rural hydroelectric power stations into a unified circuit system. The first such circuit system in Ukraine—Korsun-Shevchenkovsky—includes three rural hydroelectric power stations, which can improve the management of hydroelectric power stations.

Xinhua News Agency reports: Soviet rural areas have a variety of cultural and recreational facilities. Currently, there are approximately 37,000 cinemas and a large number of mobile film projectors in Soviet rural areas. There are 324 film facilities in rural areas of the Lithuanian Republic alone. Collective farms in various Union republics of the Soviet Union have farm clubs, libraries, and reading rooms. In the collective farms throughout the Kazakh Republic, there are about 2,000 farm clubs, reading rooms, libraries, and nearly 4,500 other cultural and educational institutions. In the collective farms of the Armenian Republic, there are a total of 1,350 libraries, with nearly 2.5 million books; in these libraries, collective farmers can read the classic works of Lenin and Stalin, the poems of Pushkin, the novels of Leo Tolstoy, and various science and technology books, newspapers, and magazines. In addition, mass sports activities have been widely launched in Soviet rural areas. Many collective farms have established sports fields, gymnasiums, sports squares, and formed mass sports organizations. Tens of thousands of collective farm members have become enthusiasts of various sports. The "Collective Farm" Educational Association of the Tajik Republic alone has nearly 40,000 athletes. Rural areas of Kuban already have more than 3,000 sports fields and other sports buildings.

Soviet farmers have extensive opportunities to learn knowledge and continuously improve their cultural level. In addition to establishing general regular schools, the Soviet state has also specifically established many free correspondence universities, agricultural colleges, and various agricultural and animal husbandry training courses for farmers. This year, three million collective farmers and state farm workers are studying in the three-year agricultural and animal husbandry training courses across the country. This year, 26,000 collective farmers and state farm workers in the Georgian Republic have graduated from various agricultural schools and obtained diplomas as first-class agricultural experts.

    苏联大力建造农村水力发电站
    农民文化娱乐生活的内容愈来愈丰富
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：今年苏联各地农村都在大力建造农村水电站。在俄罗斯联邦中部，在罗斯托夫州和斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区，在乌拉尔和其他许多地区，正在兴建着许多发电能力为一千到两千瓩的农村水电站。在中亚细亚各共和国，数以千计的农村水电站已经建造好了或正在建筑中。塔吉克共和国的集体农庄，今年从农庄公积金中拨出了一千五百多万卢布作为建造水电站的经费。这些水电站落成以后都是利用当地的小河的水力和当地的燃料资源发电的。最近以来，苏联各地不断传来了新的水电站落成的喜讯。乌克兰共和国今年已经建造好了十四个农村水电站，使全共和国的农村水电站增加为四千八百个。乌克兰共和国集体农庄的电动机的数目比一九四零年增加了十一倍。乌兹别克共和国安集延州斯大林集体农庄新近建成的一个水电站，已经开始向农庄供电了。各地新建的水电站把电流源源送到了集体农庄的住宅、田间、打谷场和牲畜饲养部门，使农村的生活和工作电气化和机械化。
    苏联各地今年新建的许多农村水电站都是由几个集体农庄共同建筑的。例如，白俄罗斯共和国维切布斯克州奥布尔河上的一个新建的农村水电站，就可以供应十个集体农庄和区中心所需的电力。各地的农村水电站都应用了工程上的最新成就。在乌克兰共和国，许多农村水电站已经改为自动控制，使得集体农庄大大减少了管理水电站的工作人员。有些地方正在进行把农村水电站合成一个统一的电路系统的工作。乌克兰的第一个这样的电路系统——科尔松、谢夫钦科夫斯基——共包括了三个农村水电站，这样就可以改进水电站的管理工作。
    据新华社讯：苏联农村有着各种各样的文化娱乐设备。现在，苏联农村中约有三万七千个电影院和大批流动电影放映机。仅在立陶宛共和国的农村中就有三百二十四个电影设备。苏联各加盟共和国的集体农庄都设有农庄俱乐部、图书馆和阅览室。在哈萨克共和国各地的集体农庄中，就有两千个左右的农庄俱乐部、阅览室、图书馆和将近四千五百个其他文化教育机构。在亚美尼亚共和国集体农庄中，共有一千三百五十个图书馆，藏书将近二百五十万册；在这些图书馆中，集体农民们可以读到列宁、斯大林的经典著作，普希金的诗歌，列夫·托尔斯泰的小说，也可以读到各种科学技术书籍、报纸和杂志。此外，群众性的体育运动已经在苏联农村广泛展开。许多集体农庄中都设立了运动场、体育馆、体育广场，并成立了群众性的体育组织。成千成万的集体农庄庄员成为各种体育运动的爱好者。单是塔吉克共和国的“集体农庄”教育协会，就拥有将近四万个运动员。库班的农村已经有三千多个运动场和其他运动建筑物。
    苏联农民有着广泛的学习知识、不断提高文化水平的机会。苏维埃国家除了建立一般的正规学校外，还专门为农民设立了许多免费的函授大学、农业专科学校和各种农业畜牧训练班。今年，在各地三年制的农业畜牧训练班学习的就有三百万个集体农民和国营农场工人。格鲁吉亚共和国今年已经有两万六千个集体农民和国营农场工人从各种农业学校毕业，并获得了一级农业专家的文凭。
