    Welcoming the Hungarian Film Week
    Chatuo'erdaoyi, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Hungarian Embassy in China

    The Hungarian Film Week, which is starting in twenty cities in China to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the Hungarian Constitution, is an important step in promoting friendly relations and cultural exchange between our two peoples.

    The Hungarian Constitution, enacted by the Hungarian people after being liberated by the glorious Soviet army, stipulates that all power in the Hungarian People's Republic belongs to the working people. The Hungarian working people have used this power to transform Hungary from a backward agricultural country into an industrial one. Our constitution stipulates that the national economy is led by the state power in order to raise the material and cultural level of the workers. In the past few weeks, our party and our government have taken measures to further improve the living standards of workers, in addition to strengthening socialist construction. Since our liberation, besides economic construction, we have fought against enemies at home and abroad who hate the people's constitution and the people's government. We have no other way but to defend our peaceful construction with persistent struggle. This struggle and large-scale construction work have brought our people to unprecedented unity. As a result of friendly cooperation, our relations with the Soviet Union and brotherly people's democracies have also been strengthened.

    In the field of our cultural life, we have eliminated the decadent tendencies of the past bourgeoisie and are moving towards prosperity on the basis of socialist realism. Hungary did not have film art in the past. The film industry, controlled by capitalists, technologically underdeveloped, and of extremely poor quality, was only intended to divert the attention of the working masses from the reality of life and from serious problems. Fascists also used the screen to incite chauvinistic hatred. People's Democratic Hungary, with the help of the Soviet Union, has established a modern state-owned film factory, and the Soviet Union has supplied the most complex parts of the technical equipment for the state film studio.

    The establishment of the ideological foundation of Hungarian film art is of greater significance than the establishment of the technical foundation of film production. Progressive film artists deeply realize that only works that reflect the lives of the working people, point out ways to solve problems for the people, and educate the people in socialist ideology can successfully serve our people.

    The film "A Foot of Land" is the first large-scale production of the Hungarian People's Republic, depicting the fighting past of Hungarian peasants; the film "Liberated Land" depicts the lives and problems of farmers who acquired land during the land reform period. These films were made in the spirit mentioned above.

    After the initial creation of several films, Hungarian film art is rapidly moving towards a more developed path. Through the film "Singing Makes Life Beautiful," which expresses the pleasant theme of factory cultural life, a new musical film comedy has been formed; through the film "Citizens on the Sports Field," a popular sports film has been formed; the film "Mrs. Déri" depicts the heroic era of Hungarian drama art, opening up the way for a series of historical films. Those films also won fame for Hungarian film art abroad last year.

    The musical opera film "Erkel" won the first prize at the 7th International Film Festival. It shows the life and work of the revolutionary artist and patriot Erkel Ferenc, the founder of Hungarian national opera. "Semmelweis" recreates the selfless career of the 19th-century physicist Semmelweis Ignác, whose merit was resisting the disease of puerperal fever. The film "The Sea Has Risen" is a color documentary depicting the Hungarian War of Independence in 1848. The quality and artistic level of documentary products have also improved in recent years. The film "The Country of Floods" shows the special world of birds in the swamps of southern Hungary. "Eszter's Wedding" is a song and dance performed by the Hungarian National Folk Ensemble, which the ensemble also performed when it visited China last year.

    Comrade Lenin said that film is the greatest force for mobilizing the masses. It is our task to take it into our own hands. Our party, considering the importance and effectiveness of film, pointed out that the main task of film art is also the central issue of our people. The most important task of film art is to serve the struggle for peace. These films educate us to wage an irreconcilable struggle against enemies at home and abroad, cultivate vigilance, and cultivate patriotism. The first film of the Film Week, "Underground Colony," depicts the struggle against the intrigues of imperialist monopolists and educates people to be vigilant. "Two Worlds" is about intellectuals fighting to defend peace. The film "Fire" shows the sabotage of internal enemies, the former rulers, and the fight against them.

    Our party instructed that the task of the film is to mobilize the masses for the realization of the Five-Year Plan. For example, the film "Katalin's Marriage" depicts the growth of a new type of worker. At the same time, it also shows women's equal rights and their participation in socialist construction.

    The development of agricultural production cooperatives and the class struggle in rural areas are shown in the film "Baptism of Fire." This film won the First Class Labor Award at the 7th International Film Festival.

    Our progressive national traditions are also shown on the screen. The first Hungarian five-color film "Mátyás the Goose Boy" is also included in the Film Week's program. It is based on a story written one hundred and fifty years ago about a people's hero who cleverly dealt with the hateful landlord and avenged the damage he suffered.

    We are very happy because the dear Chinese people can become more familiar with the life and struggle of the Hungarian people through the achievements of Hungarian film art. Among the films that are being shot in our film studio and will be released soon, there is a historical film called "Colonel Rákóczi," which depicts the struggle for freedom of the great Hungarian hero Rákóczi Ferenc in the 18th century. Another film called "Under the City" depicts the lives and work of workers who are building the Budapest subway. The film "Angry Days" recalls the events of the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. The popular science film "From Spring to Autumn" introduces forest life.

    One of the fruits of the cultural revolution is that no art in Hungary has ever attracted such a large audience as the new film art of today. Movies have now reached small villages. The number of moviegoers was 49 million in 1950, 65 million in 1951, and 110 million in 1952. Next year, at the end of the Five-Year Plan, every village will have a movie theater. These large and happy audiences naturally require our actors and directors to further improve their political thinking and to be more worthy of this glorious task in art—to educate our people and introduce the life of the Hungarian people and the struggle for peace to foreign audiences. In this regard, we have received great help from learning from the experiences and achievements of friendly countries. We are simultaneously translating many films from friendly countries into Hungarian, including several Chinese films. We organized Soviet and Chinese film festivals, we staged films from fraternal countries, and we also have progressive films from capitalist countries in our program. We have gained a lot of experience from this. We have received particularly great help from the Soviet Union. Soviet films show us the path of development, and they have strongly supported us in embarking on this path. We must emphasize here that the recently deceased Pudovkin taught our photographers, directors, actors, and writers the correct methods of political, artistic, and technical work. He did an outstanding job of demonstration in the preparation of the film "Baptism of Fire." His example illustrates the all-round and selfless assistance that selfless Soviet artists and writers give to our young art. This kind of cooperation strengthens the unity of the peace camp.

    The Hungarian people continue to watch the large-scale construction work of the great Chinese people and their heroic struggle to defend peace.

    During the Chinese Film Festival held in Hungary last year, Hungarian audiences developed a deep interest in Chinese film art. They sympathized when they saw the past suffering of the Chinese people depicted in the films; when the screen showed pictures of the happy life of liberated China, they rejoiced with our Chinese brothers. "Steel Warrior" and "The White-Haired Girl" achieved remarkable success. A Chinese Film Festival will be held in Hungary again in early October this year, and the latest products of the People's Republic of China in film art will be included in the program, which is eagerly awaited by Hungarian audiences.

    We know that China is also very interested in the construction work and development of the Hungarian people. Therefore, through the screening of Hungarian films in China, we will definitely be able to strengthen the friendly ties between our two peoples. This is a great joy for us, and we will fight for peace and socialism in closer unity.

    迎接匈牙利电影周
    匈牙利驻华大使馆临时代办  察托尔道伊
    为了庆祝匈牙利宪法制定四周年纪念日而在中国二十个城市开始举行的匈牙利电影周，是增进我们两国人民间友好关系和文化交流的一个重要步骤。
    被苏联的光荣军队解放了的匈牙利人民的宪法，指出在匈牙利人民共和国里，一切权力属于劳动人民。匈牙利劳动人民利用了这个权力把匈牙利由一个落后的农业国家改变成为一个工业国家。我们的宪法制定：国民经济受国家权力的领导，为的是提高劳动者的物质及文化水平。我们的党及我们的政府在前几星期中作了一些措施，目的在除了加强社会主义建设外，更进一步地提高工人的生活水平。自从我们解放以后，除了经济建设工作，我们向仇视人民宪法和人民政府的内外仇人们战斗过。我们没有别的办法，只有用坚持的斗争来保卫我们的和平建设。这种斗争和大规模的建设工作使得我们的人民达到空前的团结。由于友好合作的结果，我们和苏联及兄弟人民民主国家的关系也加强了。
    在我们的文化生活领域中，我们已经消灭了过去资产阶级的颓废倾向，而在社会主义现实主义的基础上走向繁荣。匈牙利从前没有电影艺术。在资本家掌握中的、技术不发达的、质量极坏的电影工业成品，其目的只是为了要把劳动群众的注意力从生活现实、从严重的问题上转移开去。法西斯主义者也利用银幕来刺激沙文主义的仇恨。人民民主主义的匈牙利在苏联的帮助下建立了现代的国营电影工厂，苏联供应了国家电影制片厂技术设备的最复杂部分。
    匈牙利电影艺术的思想意识基础的奠定比影片产品的技术基础的奠定有更巨大的意义。进步的电影艺术家们深刻地认识到，只有反映劳动人民生活、给人民指出解决问题的途径以及对人民进行社会主义思想的教育的作品，才可以成功地服务于我们的人民。
    影片“一寸土”，是匈牙利人民共和国的第一部大型出品，表现了匈牙利农民的战斗的过去；影片“解放了的土地”表现了在土地改革时期获得了土地的农民的生活和问题。这些影片就是在上述的那种精神下摄制的。
    在最初创作的几个影片之后，匈牙利影片艺术迅速地迈向更发展的道路。通过表现工厂文化生活的愉快主题的影片“唱歌使得生活美丽”，新的音乐电影的喜剧构成了；通过影片“运动场上的公民们”构成了体育电影的普及片；影片“德里夫人”表现了匈牙利戏剧艺术的英雄年代，为一系列的历史影片开拓了道路。那些片子去年也在国外为匈牙利电影艺术博得了声誉。
    音乐歌剧片“艾克尔”在第七届国际电影节得首奖，它表现了革命艺术家和爱国者艾克尔·弗伦克、匈牙利民族歌剧创始者的生活和工作。“森萨麦威斯”再现了十九世纪物理科学家森萨麦威斯·伊格那斯的无私的事业，他的功绩是抵抗产褥热的疾病。影片“海水涨上来了”是一部彩色纪录片，描写一八四八年匈牙利的独立战争。这些年来纪录片产品的质量和艺术水平也提高了。影片“洪水的国家”表现南匈牙利沼地上鸟儿们的特殊世界。“爱瑟的婚礼”是匈牙利国家人民文工团的歌舞，去年文工团访问中国时也表演了的。
    列宁同志说，电影是鼓动群众的最大力量，把它拿到我们自己手上，这是我们的任务。我们的党考虑到电影的重要性和效能，指出电影艺术的主要任务同时也是我们人民的中心问题。电影艺术的最主要的任务是为争取和平的斗争服务。这些影片教育我们向内外敌人作不调和的斗争，培养警惕心，培养爱国主义。电影周的第一个影片“地下殖民地”描写反对帝国主义垄断者的诡计的斗争，并且教育人们要警惕。“两个世界”是有关知识分子为保卫和平而战斗的。影片“火”表现内部敌人、从前的统治者的破坏，和反对他们的战斗。
    我们的党指示：为了五年计划的实现而动员群众，是影片的任务。例如影片“卡塔琳的婚姻”，描写新型工人的成长。同时它把妇女们的平等权利和她们的参加社会主义建设也表现了出来。
    农业生产合作社的发展问题和农村中的阶级斗争在影片“战斗的洗礼”中表现出来。这个影片在第七届国际电影节中得到劳动一等奖。
    我们进步的民族传统也表现在银幕上。第一部匈牙利五彩影片“牧鹅少年马季”也列在电影周的节目中，它是根据一百五十年前写的关于一个人民英雄的故事，他聪明地对付那可恨的地主，而且为了他所受到的损害复了仇。
    我们很高兴，因为亲爱的中国人民可以从匈牙利电影艺术的成绩中更熟悉匈牙利人民的生活和斗争。在我们电影制片厂中正在摄制、不久就要问世的影片中，有一个历史影片名叫“拉科西中校”，它表现十八世纪的伟大匈牙利英雄拉科西·弗伦克为自由的战斗。另一个叫作“在城下”的影片，描写正在布达佩斯兴建地下铁道的工人们的生活和工作。影片“愤怒的日子”使人记起一九一九年匈牙利苏维埃共和国的事迹。科学普及影片“从春到秋”介绍了森林生活。
    文化革命的成果之一是：在匈牙利从没有任何艺术像今天的新电影艺术一样，曾经吸引了这么广大的群众。电影现在已经达到小村庄了。电影观众在一九五○年是四千九百万人次，一九五一年六千五百万人次，一九五二年一亿一千万人次。明年，五年计划的终了，每个村庄都将有一个电影院。这些大量和愉快的观众自然要求我们的演员和导演更加提高他们的政治思想，在艺术方面也要更加担当得起这光荣的任务——教育我们的人民，把匈牙利人民的生活及为和平的斗争介绍给国外观众。在这方面，我们已经在学习友邦的经验和成绩中得到极大的帮助。我们正把许多友邦的影片同时译制为匈文，其中有几部中国影片。我们组织了苏联和中国的电影节，我们上演了兄弟国家的影片，在我们的节目中也有资本主义国家的进步影片。我们由此得到很多经验。我们特别从苏联得到巨大的帮助。苏联影片展示给我们发展的道路，而且他们已经大力地支持我们走上这条道路。我们在这里必须强调，新近去世的普多夫金，教给我们的摄影者、导演、演员和作家以政治、艺术和技术工作的正确方法，他在“战斗的洗礼”影片的准备工作中作了一次示范的杰出工作。他的例子说明了忘我的苏联艺术家和作家给我们年轻的艺术的多方面的、无私的援助。这种合作加强了和平阵营的团结。
    匈牙利人民继续注视着伟大的中国人民的大规模建设工作，和他们保卫和平的英雄的战斗。
    去年在匈牙利举行的中国电影节中，匈牙利观众对中国电影艺术发生了很深的兴趣，他们看到影片上表现中国人民以往的痛苦时很同情；当银幕上出现解放了的中国的快乐生活的画面时，他们和我们的中国兄弟一同欢乐。“钢铁战士”和“白毛女”获得了显著的成功。今年十月初，在匈牙利又要有一个中国电影节，中华人民共和国在电影艺术方面的最新出品将排列到节目中去，那是被匈牙利观众热烈期待着的。
    我们知道，中国对匈牙利人民的建设工作及发展也有极大兴趣的，因此通过匈牙利影片在中国的放映，一定能够加强我们两国人民间的友好联系。这对我们是一个巨大的快乐，我们将在更亲密的团结中为和平及社会主义而战斗。
