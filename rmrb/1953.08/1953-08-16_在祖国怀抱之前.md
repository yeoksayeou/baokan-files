Before Embracing the Motherland
    Lin Wei
    On the highlands west of Panmunjom, comrades from the Korean and Chinese sides, former prisoners of war returning from POW camps in Jeju Island and elsewhere, are passing through a large red archway marked "Embracing the Motherland" and returning to their homelands. I spent some unforgettable days here. The many scenes I witnessed filled me with uncontrollable anger and tears. I deeply rejoice that those unfortunate comrades who were captured have finally, after persistent struggle, escaped the bloody hands of the fascist barbarian tyrants and slave owners, and returned to their civilized countries, to the warm embrace of their motherland and the embrace of their mothers.

    The American aggressors and their accomplices are most fond of talking about so-called "respect for individual will" and "humanitarian principles." However, their brutal treatment of our unarmed captured personnel specifically demonstrates that their words are nothing but shameless lies.

    A captured comrade of the Korean People's Army had both eyes gouged out with sharp knives simply because he insisted on repatriation, insisted on returning to his motherland! Such an act is difficult to imagine for humanity. But it is a fact! This comrade who had his eyes gouged out just walked out of an American repatriation vehicle. He walked down the steps of the vehicle, supporting the arm of his comrade, and stood in front of the cameras and film cameras of news reporters from various countries and American news reporters. The two bloody holes where his eyes had been gouged out had only received so-called "treatment" with salt water twice. Now the wounds are covered with gauze. He insisted on not giving up his desire to return to his motherland, and now he has finally returned; however, his eyes can no longer see his beloved family, comrades, and beloved motherland! He shouted wildly with all his might, denouncing. His throat was hoarse and about to burst. He hoped that everyone could hear his shouts and denunciations. His name is Kim Jung-won. I believe that all righteous people in the world will remember his name and rise up to shout and denounce.

    Yang Yuting, this is a cook of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, a simple Sichuan farmer. When the U.S. side conducted so-called "screening" in early April last year, he was beaten unconscious and then taken to a POW camp for those who "refused repatriation." There, because he insisted on saying "The Communist Party is good," and insisted on going to a POW camp for those who insisted on repatriation, he was beaten to the point of death four times, and was even put in a canvas bag, filled with cold water, and trampled on overnight. His left hand was stabbed with a sharp knife; his abdomen was pierced by a bullet, leaving a palm-sized scar; his right arm was broken and he was crippled. Yang Yuting and other returning comrades told me that in order to insist on repatriation and insist on returning to their country, many comrades were killed, strangled, or buried alive. Even more thousands of people were beaten and crippled or seriously injured. These beastly atrocities were carried out openly under the banner of the "United Nations Forces" with "U.S." knives. Lin Xuefu, a translator of the Volunteer Army, was skinned alive piece by piece. With each cut, he shouted heroically "Long live the Communist Party!" until his death. Finally, the murderers dug out his heart, held it up with a knife for all to see, and said: "Whoever wants to return to the mainland, this is an example, leave the flesh and heart behind!" Yang Wenhua, a radio operator, was beaten to death with an iron bar and his heart was dug out for public display. Qi Zhongtang, a member of the cultural troupe, was strangled to death with a rope and his body was hung on the roof. There are even more who suffered non-judicial punishments such as having kerosene poured into their mouths and having flesh cut from their arms!

    Not only was it like this during the "screening," but even after the repatriation agreement and the armistice agreement were signed and came into effect, and even during the repatriation journey, the enemy continued to persecute our captured personnel. Li Chuantong and other volunteers complained upon their return: before repatriation, they requested to see their comrades imprisoned in another barbed wire fence, requested to retrieve the bodies of their fallen comrades, and requested to ensure safety on the road. For this reason, they were attacked with fifty poison gas bombs, more than five hundred people were poisoned, and more than two hundred people fainted. Li Chuantong's back is still red and swollen. On the ship, in order to prevent them from singing their own songs, the enemy deliberately blocked all ventilation gaps completely, making it difficult for people in the crowded room to breathe, until dozens of people fainted.

    The same goes for women and children. Li Shi and others of the People's Army complained: when they were boarding the train in Busan, six poison gas bombs were thrown into their carriage, seven people fainted, and Li Shi himself was seriously injured. The reason was that they refused to hand over their homemade national flag. There were two children and twenty-six female patients sitting in this carriage, which did not arouse any human sympathy from the U.S. repatriation personnel. Until the car passed the military demarcation line and Panmunjom Bridge, the American repatriation personnel beat four women.

    However, all these brutal methods have failed to destroy the will of our captured comrades to return to their motherland. The majority of people still risked their lives to insist on demanding repatriation. Yang Yuting told me that his idea was very simple: "Either return to the motherland, or die. Anyway, I can't live a life worse than a beast of burden in the enemy's place." The enemy threatened to shoot him countless times, and he replied: "Shoot me quickly, if I don't die, I will return to the motherland." Now, under the support of the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world, they have finally won.

    Hatred and anger towards the aggressors and accomplices are burning like inextinguishable flames in front of the gate of "Embracing the Motherland." Before they even get out of the suffocating dark trucks of the enemy, they are desperately hitting the carriages. As soon as the door opens, American worn-out shoes, belts, kettles, clothes, blankets... are slammed out of the car like garbage. Worthless American "civilization" is trampled on the ground. The American military police opening the door are sticking close to the carriage, letting the door shield them. They are afraid to face the angry faces and hateful eyes inside the car, afraid that the shoes and kettles thrown out will hit them. When the soldiers are helped down the car by the affectionate arms of their compatriots, they tear up and throw away any piece of American cloth, leaving only the homemade national military caps on their heads and the homemade national flag in their hands. Some young children even tear off their underpants and walk naked back into the embrace of their motherland, back into the embrace of their mothers. They are unwilling to let any American thing continue to remain on their clean bodies.

    American officers brazenly protested that these actions damaged the dignity of the "United Nations Forces." But they are unwilling to ask themselves if they ever had any dignity? Their own treatment of prisoners of war has destroyed even the dignity of ordinary human beings! Look: those who were injured by sticks, those who were stabbed by knives, those who were burned by poison gas bombs, those who were burned by branding irons, those who had large pieces of flesh cut off from their good arms... are now being carried down or helped down from American cars. Some of their wounds are bandaged, and some are exposed to the light of day, causing people to see them with their eyes and feel the pain in their hearts. As soon as they get out of the car, they point at the noses of American officers to complain, and some are angrily reading out complaint letters that have not been searched away. Why can American officers only listen with embarrassment and lowered heads? Why don't they refute these facts? Why don't they say a word, don't make a sound, and don't even dare to raise their heads? Where has their prestige gone?

    Now, the captured comrades have struggled out of the dark abyss of suffering. Fathers, elders, brothers and sisters of the motherland are waving fiery red flags everywhere, waving to them, and the vast boundless land of the motherland and the life of true humanity are waving to them, welcoming them to return and participate in the great construction cause of the motherland. Loud songs are sounding. But when they sing of their beloved motherland, torrents of tears flow from the eyes of these comrades who have suffered torment and devastation. Female comrades are crying bitterly. When a male comrade got into his motherland's car, he shouted to other comrades: "Don't cry, comrades, we must turn grief into strength and repay the motherland's concern for us with action!"

### 在祖国怀抱之前

    在祖国怀抱之前
    林韦
    在板门店西边的高地上，从济州岛等地战俘营归来的朝中两国被俘同志们，正经过横标着“祖国怀抱”的大红彩门陆续回到自己的祖国来。在这里，我度过了一些永远不能忘记的日子。我所看到的许多景象，使我不能抑止怒火的燃烧和眼泪的汹涌。我深深地庆幸那些不幸被俘的同志们终于经过坚持的斗争，逃出了法西斯野蛮暴君和奴隶主的血手，回到自己的文明国度里来，回到温暖的祖国怀抱和母亲怀抱里来。
    美国侵略者和它的帮凶者是最喜欢侈谈所谓“尊重个人意志”和“人道原则”的。但是，他们对待手无寸铁的我方被俘人员的残暴行为，却具体地说明了他们所说的话乃是无耻谎言。
    朝鲜人民军的一个被俘同志仅仅因为坚持遣返，坚持要回自己的祖国，两只眼睛就被用尖刀剜掉了！对于人类，这种行为是难于设想的。但这是事实！这个被剜掉眼睛的同志现在就从美国的遣俘汽车里走出来了。他扶着自己同志的手臂走下车梯，站立在各国新闻记者和美国新闻记者的摄影机、电影机面前。他的被剜掉了眼睛的两只血洞，仅仅得到过两次盐水洗涤的所谓“治疗”。现在创口被用纱布遮掩着。他坚持不肯放弃回祖国的愿望，现在他终于回来了；可是，他的眼睛已经看不见自己亲爱的家属、同志和亲爱的祖国了！他使尽力气在狂喊，控诉。他的喉咙嘶哑了，快要破裂了。他希望所有的人都能听到他的呼喊和控诉。他的名字叫金井元。我相信全世界正直的人们将记得他的名字，并起来呼喊，控诉。
    杨玉廷，这是中国人民志愿军的一个炊事员，一个纯朴的四川农民。去年四月上旬美方进行所谓
    “甄别”时，他被打得晕倒在地，然后被抬到所谓
    “拒绝遣返”的战俘营去。在那里，因为他坚持要说“共产党好”，坚持要到坚持遣返的战俘营去，又被打得死去四次，还被装到帆布袋里灌上凉水，踩打过一夜。他的左手被尖刀戳伤了；腹部被子弹打穿了，留下手掌大的伤疤；右臂被打断了，残废了。杨玉廷和另外一些归来的同志告诉我：为了坚持遣返，坚持回国，许多同志被杀死，勒死，或者活埋了。更有成千的人是被打成残废或重伤的。这些野兽般的暴行，是在“联合国军”的旗帜下公开用“U·S·”刀子进行的。志愿军的翻译员林学甫，被一刀一刀地剐了。每剐一刀，他就壮烈地喊一声
    “共产党万岁！”一直到死。最后，凶手们挖出他的心，用刀子挑着示众，说：“谁想回大陆，这就是例子，把肉和心留下！”报话员杨文华，是被铁棒打死后挖心示众的。文工团员戚忠堂，被用绳子勒死后悬尸于屋上。其他受火油灌口、臂上割肉等非刑的，更不知有多少！
    不仅在“甄别”时是这样，一直到遣俘协议和停战协定签署生效之后以至遣返途中，敌人还不断残害我方被俘人员。志愿军的李传通等归来时控诉：他们在遣返前要求见一下被囚于另一铁丝网中的同志，要求起回死难同志的尸体，要求保障路上安全。就为这个原故，他们遭到五十枚毒瓦斯弹的攻击，五百多人中毒，昏倒二百多人。李传通的背部现在还红肿着。在船上，敌人为了不让他们唱自己的歌，故意把所有通风的缝隙完全堵死，使拥挤室内的人们难于呼吸，直至晕倒数十人。
    对妇女儿童也是一样。人民军李实等控诉：在釜山上火车的时候，她们所在的车厢被掷入六枚毒瓦斯弹，七人昏倒，李实本人重伤。原因是她们不肯交出自制的祖国国旗。这个车厢内坐着两个儿童，二十六个女病人，并没有引起美方遣送人员任何人类的同情。一直到汽车开过了军事分界线和板门桥，美国的遣送人员还殴打了四个妇女。
    但是，这一切残暴手段都没有能摧毁我方被俘同志回归祖国的意志。大多数人还是豁出性命来坚持要求遣返。杨玉廷告诉我：他的想法很简单：“要末就回祖国去，要末就死。反正不能在敌人那里过牛马不如的生活。”敌人无数次地威胁说要枪毙他，他回答：“要枪毙请快点，死不了我就要回祖国去。”如今，他们终于在朝中人民和全世界人民声援之下获得胜利了。
    对于侵略者和帮凶者的仇恨和愤怒，像浇不熄的烈火一样在“祖国怀抱”的门前燃烧着。还没有走出敌人那窒息的黑暗的卡车，他们就在拼命撞击着车厢。车门一开，美国的破皮鞋、皮带、水壶、衣服、毯子……就被猛力打下车来，像垃圾一样。不值钱的美国“文明”被践踏在地上。开车门的美国军警紧贴着车厢，让车门掩护着自己。他们害怕面对车内愤怒的面孔和仇恨的目光，害怕丢出来的皮鞋、水壶砸到自己身上。战士们在扶着自己同胞的爱抚的手臂走下车来的时候，把美国的任何一点布片也撕碎扔下了，只留下自制的祖国军帽戴在头上，自制的祖国国旗擎在手里。有的年轻孩子连裤衩也撕掉，赤条条地走回祖国怀抱里来，走回自己母亲的怀抱里来。他们不愿意让任何一件美国的东西继续留在自己干净的躯体上。
    美国军官厚颜地抗议说，这些行动损害了“联合国军”的尊严。他们却不愿意反问自己何曾有什么尊严？他们自己对待战俘的行为，甚至连一般人类的尊严也毁坏无遗了！请看：被棒子打伤的，被刀子戳伤的，被毒气弹烧伤的，被烙铁烙伤的，好好的臂膀被割掉大片肉的……现在都从美国的汽车上被抬下来或搀扶下来了。他们的创伤有的被包扎着，有的暴露在光天化日之下，使人看到眼里，痛到心里。他们一下车就指着美国军官的鼻子控诉，有的在愤激地宣读没有被搜走的控诉书。美国军官为什么只能尴尬地低着头听呢？他们为什么不来反驳这些事实呢？他们为什么一言不发，一声不响，连头也不敢抬起来呢？他们的威风那里去了呢？
    现在，被俘的同志们从黝黑的苦难的深渊里奋斗出来了。祖国的父老兄弟姐妹们到处在挥动着火红的旗帜，向他们招手，广阔无边的祖国大地和真正人类的生活在向他们招手，欢迎他们归来参加祖国的伟大建设事业。嘹亮的歌声响起来了。但是，当他们歌唱亲爱的祖国的时候，汹涌的热泪从这些受尽折磨和摧残的同志们眼里奔流出来了。女同志们痛哭失声了。一个男同志坐上自己祖国的汽车时向其他同志高喊：“不要哭了，同志们，我们要把悲痛化为力量，用行动来报答祖国人民对我们的关怀！”    （八月十日在开城）（附图片）
