Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 12th: TASS Moscow, August 12th: As previously reported, the Soviet government sent a note to the US government on July 31st, strongly protesting the bandit-like attack by four US fighter planes on a Soviet IL-12 passenger plane in the airspace of the People's Republic of China on July 27th, resulting in the destruction of the Soviet passenger plane and the deaths of twenty-one Soviet citizens.

On August 1st, the US Embassy in the Soviet Union, on behalf of the US government, delivered a response to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding this matter. On August 11th, Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs A. Gromyko received US Ambassador Charles Bohlen regarding this matter and delivered a note.

The Soviet note reiterated the fact that four US fighter planes bandit-like destroyed a Soviet passenger plane near Hwadian in the territory of the People's Republic of China at 11:28 AM local time on July 27th, resulting in the deaths of twenty-one Soviet citizens. The note then stated that the attack by US fighter planes on the unarmed Soviet passenger plane occurred near Hwadian, 110 kilometers from the Sino-Korean border, which is on the regular route from Lushun to Vladivostok, on which Soviet passenger planes have been flying for several years. The position of the Soviet plane when it was attacked by the US fighter planes was 43 degrees 5 minutes north latitude and 127 degrees 45 minutes east longitude.

Upon receiving the news of the attack on the Soviet plane by US fighter planes and the resulting destruction of the Soviet plane, the Soviet Central Administration of Civil Aviation immediately dispatched a special committee to the Hwadian area to investigate the damage to the Soviet plane. The committee found the bodies of fifteen passengers and six pilots, as well as the wreckage of the plane. The committee's investigation proved that six bodies had bullet and shrapnel wounds, and the plane wreckage found had nineteen bullet holes. The parachutes and other items inside the plane also had bullet holes. The committee also interviewed local Chinese residents who witnessed the US fighter planes attacking the Soviet passenger plane, and they fully confirmed the facts presented in the Soviet government's note of July 31st.

In its note of August 1st, the US government admitted that US fighter planes attacked an IL-12 plane at 11:25 AM local time on July 27th, which is roughly consistent with the time of the attack cited in the Soviet note. As a result of the aforementioned attack, the IL-12 plane was shot down. However, the US government insisted that the IL-12 plane was attacked not in Chinese airspace but over North Korea, about eight miles from the Yalu River, at a location of 41 degrees 38 minutes north latitude and 126 degrees 55 minutes east longitude. This is a statement that attempts to deny the irrefutable evidence. In reality, the incident of the US fighter planes attacking the Soviet passenger plane did not occur at the location indicated in the US government's note, but at the aforementioned location of 43 degrees 5 minutes north latitude and 127 degrees 45 minutes east longitude, which is not in North Korean territory eight miles from the Yalu River, but in Chinese territory, 170 kilometers northeast of the location indicated in the US note.

Therefore, the US government's note correctly indicated the time of the US fighter planes' attack on the Soviet passenger plane, but incorrectly indicated the location of the attack. It is clear that the US government is mistaken about the location where the US fighter planes attacked the Soviet passenger plane.

Based on the above, the Soviet government reiterates its strong protest lodged on July 31st against the bandit-like attack by US military planes on the unarmed Soviet IL-12 passenger plane, and firmly demands that those who committed this crime be severely punished and that the US military authorities prevent such criminal actions from happening again in the future.

At the same time, the Soviet government firmly demands that the US government compensate the Soviet Union for the losses it suffered as a result of the deaths of twenty-one Soviet citizens and the destruction of the IL-12 plane. An assessment of the losses is detailed in the attachment to this note.

A. Gromyko also handed over the aforementioned note's attachment to Bohlen, which stated that the amount of compensation for the losses suffered by the Soviet Union due to the deaths of Soviet citizens and the destruction of the plane is 7,445,800 rubles or $1,861,450. This compensation includes: 420,000 rubles for pensions to the families of the deceased passengers and flight crew, 5,670,000 rubles for allowances for the deceased's minor children and elderly parents, 315,000 rubles for the burial and transportation costs of the deceased's remains, 84,000 rubles for compensation for the loss of the deceased's personal belongings, and 956,800 rubles to compensate for the cost of the IL-12 plane.

US Ambassador Bohlen said that he would forward the aforementioned note and its attachment to his government.

### 苏联驳斥美国抵赖美机击毁苏联客机罪行  再次照会美国并要求严惩罪犯赔偿损失

    苏联驳斥美国抵赖美机击毁苏联客机罪行
    再次照会美国并要求严惩罪犯赔偿损失
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：前已报道，苏联政府曾在七月三十一日照会美国政府，坚决抗议四架美国战斗机七月二十七日在中华人民共和国领空对一架苏联伊尔十二式客机进行强盗式的袭击，并因此造成苏联客机被击毁和苏联公民二十一人死难的结果。
    八月一日，美国驻苏联大使馆奉美国政府之命将关于这个问题的覆照送交苏联外交部。苏联外交部副部长亚·葛罗米柯八月十一日就此事接见美国大使查·波伦并递交照会一件。
    苏联照会重述了美国战斗机四架于七月二十七日当地时间十一点二十八分，在中华人民共和国领土桦甸附近上空，强盗般击毁苏联客机并招致苏联公民二十一人死难的事实。照会接着说，美国战斗机对没有武装的苏联客机的袭击，是发生在距离中朝边界一百一十公里处的桦甸附近，桦甸就在从旅顺口到海参崴的正规航线上，苏联客机在这条航线上已飞行了几年。苏联飞机在被美国战斗机袭击的时候的方位是北纬四十三度五分，东经一百二十七度四十五分。
    苏联中央民用航空管理处在接到美国战斗机袭击苏联飞机及苏联飞机因此而被击毁的消息，立即派特别委员会前往桦甸地区调查苏联飞机毁坏的情况。委员会发现了十五个乘客和六个飞行员的尸体以及飞机的残骸。委员会所进行的调查证明，六个尸体有子弹和弹片的伤口，被发现的飞机残骸上有十九个弹孔。飞机里面的降落伞和其他物品上也有弹孔。委员会还询问了当地亲眼看见美国战斗机袭击苏联客机的中国居民，他们完全证实了苏联政府七月三十一日照会中所提出的事实。
    美国政府在它今年八月一日的照会中，承认美国战斗机在七月二十七日当地时间十一点二十五分袭击一架伊尔十二式飞机，这与苏联照会所举的关于袭击的时间大致相符。由于上述袭击的结果，伊尔十二式飞机被击落了。然而，美国政府硬说伊尔十二式飞机不是在中国领空而是在朝鲜境内离鸭绿江约八英里的北纬四十一度三十八分、东经一百二十六度五十五分的地点的上空受到美国战斗机的袭击的。这是将证据确凿的事实加以抹杀的说法。实际上，美国战斗机袭击苏联客机的事件并不是发生在美国政府照会所指出的地点，而是发生在上述北纬四十三度五分和东经一百二十七度四十五分的地点，这个地点并不在离鸭绿江八英里的朝鲜领土上空，而是在中国境内，在美国照会所指出的地点东北一百七十公里处的上空。
    因此，美国政府的照会正确地指出了美国战斗机袭击苏联客机的时间，但是不正确地指出了袭击的地点。显然，美国政府在美国战斗机袭击苏联客机的地点方面是错误的。
    根据上述，苏联政府重申它在七月三十一日就美国军用飞机对苏联没有武装的伊尔十二式客机进行的强盗式的袭击而提出的坚决抗议，并且坚决要求严惩犯了这种罪行的人员并防止美国军事当局今后再有这种罪恶的行动。
    同时，苏联政府坚决要求美国政府应该赔偿苏联因二十一个苏联公民的死难和伊尔十二式飞机的被击毁而遭受到的损失。关于损失的估价在本照会的附件中另有说明。
    亚·葛罗米柯同时也将上述的照会附件递交波伦，这个附件表明：对苏联因苏联公民的死难和飞机的被击毁而遭受到的损失的赔偿数目，是七百四十四万五千八百卢布或一百八十六万一千四百五十美元。这笔赔偿包括：死难乘客和飞行人员家属的抚恤金四十二万卢布，死难者的未成年子女和年老双亲的津贴五百六十七万卢布。死难者遗体的安葬和搬运费用三十一万五千卢布，死难者个人财物损失的赔偿费八万四千卢布，赔偿伊尔十二式飞机的成本九十五万六千八百卢布。
    美国大使波伦说，他将把上述照会及其附件转交给他的政府。
