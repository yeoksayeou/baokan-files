Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th -- The Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a decision on the 12th regarding the Soviet government's aid of one billion rubles to Korea for the restoration of the people's economy.

The decision pointed out: The great Soviet Union not only liberated the Korean people from the rule of Japanese imperialism, but also provided the Korean people with enormous economic, technical, and cultural assistance after liberation. Under this fraternal assistance, the Korean people, through their creative labor and struggle, rapidly established a consolidated democratic base in the northern half of the Republic for the sake of national reunification and independence. During our Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggression of the American imperialists, the Soviet Union actively supported and voiced its support for our just struggle, enabling us to achieve a brilliant victory.

Today, the urgent task of rapidly restoring and developing the devastated people's economy and raising our living standards is before the Korean people. At this time, the tremendous assistance given to us Korean people by the Soviet government gives us new strength and encourages us to move towards new victories.

The decision said: The Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, together with all the Korean people, expresses its infinite gratitude to the Soviet government for its assistance, and will use this huge amount of aid to restore the devastated people's economy, lay the foundation for the country's future industrial victory, and improve the material and cultural life of our people. The Korean people will further strengthen their friendship with the Soviet people and victoriously complete the great task of restoring and developing the post-war people's economy in order to repay the fraternal assistance given to us by the Soviet people.

    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁发布决定
    感谢苏联给朝鲜以巨大经济援助
    【新华社平壤十五日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁，十二日就苏联政府以十亿卢布援助朝鲜恢复人民经济建设一事，发布了一项决定。
    决定中指出：伟大的苏联，不但把朝鲜人民从日本帝国主义的统治下解放出来，而且在解放后给了朝鲜人民以经济、技术和文化上的巨大援助。朝鲜人民在这种兄弟般的援助下，通过自己创造性的劳动和斗争，短期内便在共和国北半部建立起为争取祖国统一、独立的巩固的民主基地。在我们反对美帝国主义武装侵略者的祖国解放战争时期，苏联积极地支持和声援了我们的正义斗争，使我们取得了光辉的胜利。
    今天，在朝鲜人民面前正摆着迅速地恢复和发展被破坏的人民经济和提高自己生活水平的紧急任务。苏联政府在这时候，给予我们朝鲜人民的这个莫大援助，给了我们以新的力量，鼓舞着我们走向新的胜利。
    决定说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁和全朝鲜人民一起，对于苏联政府的援助表示无限的感谢，并要把这笔巨额援助金用来恢复被破坏的人民经济，奠定国家未来工业胜利的基础和提高我们人民的物质文化生活。朝鲜人民要进一步加强与苏联人民的友谊，胜利地完成恢复和发展战后人民经济的巨大任务，以报答苏联人民给予我们的兄弟般的援助。
