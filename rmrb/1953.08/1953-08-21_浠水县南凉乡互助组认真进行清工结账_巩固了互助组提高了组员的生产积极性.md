    Nanliang Township is a township in Sandian District, Xishui County, Hubei Province with a relatively good foundation in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. For two years, the farmers in this township have practiced mutual aid production under the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, achieving great results. However, because various mutual aid teams often failed to properly settle work accounts after exchanging labor, some work accounts from last year remained unsettled until this year, causing considerable difficulties for this year's mutual aid teams, and some mutual aid teams even collapsed because of this.

    Before the Dragon Boat Festival this year, some team members requested the team to settle work accounts, but some households that should contribute labor did not want to. There were roughly two situations: one was that because the mutual aid team had some problems with the order of assigning work in production, their production suffered some losses, and they felt it was a disadvantage to contribute labor. The other was that they fundamentally did not understand the principle of equal value and mutual benefit within the mutual aid team, and wanted to renege on the settlement of work accounts. Township cadres also had incorrect views on settling work accounts: some believed that settling work accounts for the mutual aid team was an offensive matter and were afraid it would be difficult to handle; some believed that the farmers themselves knew how to settle work accounts, so they were left unattended; and others believed that it would not matter if the settlement of work accounts was delayed until the second half of the year when they were free.

    In response to the above situation, the township Party branch first made cadres and mutual aid team leaders fully aware that settling work accounts for mutual aid teams was an important issue for consolidating and developing mutual aid teams, and then persuaded and educated team members who were resistant to settling work accounts. They first used the example of mutual aid teams that collapsed last year due to failure to settle work accounts to illustrate the harm of not settling work accounts according to the season; they also compared the differences in everyone's life and crops before and after participating in the mutual aid team to inspire them to recognize the benefits of mutual aid production and the necessity of settling work accounts.

    In addition, the branch also used different methods to help each team summarize its work based on different problems. For teams with minor problems and few opinions, they started with summarizing production and raising the team members' awareness, so that the team members realized the benefits of participating in the mutual aid team, allowing them to automatically do a good job in settling work accounts and improving the mutual aid team. For teams with internal problems and disagreements among team members, they started with promoting democracy, affirmed the achievements of the previous stage, identified shortcomings, carried out criticism, and determined future improvement measures. As a result, many team members reflected: "After speaking clearly (opinions), we are willing to contribute labor." For those teams that insisted on settling accounts rigidly, stubbornly demanding labor, and not combining the summarization of mutual aid achievements with the examination of shortcomings, leading to disputes, they actively mediated to prevent the mutual aid team from collapsing due to disputes.

    After settling work accounts and summarizing production achievements, the team members in this township increased their confidence in cooperation and mutual aid, and everyone actively added and repaired farm tools in preparation for the next stage of production.

    浠水县南凉乡互助组认真进行清工结账
    巩固了互助组提高了组员的生产积极性
    南凉乡是湖北省浠水县三店区互助合作运动基础较好的乡。两年来这个乡的农民在自愿互利的原则下实行互助生产，获得了很大成绩。但由于各个互助组在互相换工后常常不能很好地清工结账，有些去年的工账一直遗留到今年还没有结清，给今年的互助组带来了不少困难，有的互助组甚至因此垮了台。
    今年端午节前，一些组员要求组内进行清工结账，但有些应出分子的户不想出。其中大约有两种情况：一种是由于互助组在生产中排工的先后有些毛病，他们的生产受了些损失，觉得出了分子有些吃亏。另一种是对互助组内的等价互利原则根本认识不够，清工结账时想抵赖。乡干部对清工结账也有不正确看法：有的认为互助组清工结账是得罪人的事，怕不大好搞；有的认为清工结账农民自己晓得搞，因而放任不管；还有人认为清工结账压到下半年空闲时再搞也不要紧。
    该乡党支部针对以上情况，首先使干部及互助组组长充分认识互助组清工结账是巩固与发展互助组的重要问题，接着又对清工结账有抵触的组员进行说服教育。他们首先找出去年因不清工结账垮了台的互助组做例子，说明不按季节清工结账的危害性；又把大家在参加互助组前后的生活和庄稼的不同作了对比，启发他们认识了互助生产的好处和清工结账的必要性。
    另外，支部又根据不同问题运用不同的方法帮助各组总结了工作。对意见不大问题不多的组，就从总结生产，提高组员认识着手，使组员认识到参加互助组的好处，让他们自动地做好清工结账工作，把互助组提高一步。对组内有问题，组员相互有意见的，则从发扬民主着手，肯定上阶段的成绩，找出缺点，开展批评，确定今后改进办法。这样一来，很多组员反映：“把话（意见）说清楚了，出分子也心甘情愿。”对那些硬结账、死要分，不结合总结互助成绩与检查缺点以致闹起了纠纷的组，则积极进行调解，防止互助组因闹意见而垮台。
    该乡经过互助组清工结账、总结生产成绩以后，组员对合作互助的信心提高了，大家积极添置、修整农具，准备下阶段生产。
