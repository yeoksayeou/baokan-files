Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: TASS, New York, August 25th -- The UN General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion of the Korean question on the afternoon of August 24th. Representatives of the Lee Seung-man group, as well as representatives from Peru, Indonesia, and Byelorussia, spoke. The representative of the Lee Seung-man group supported the statement of the US representative, arguing that India should not participate in the political conference. He devoted most of his speech to making rude attacks on the Indian government. The tone of the speech was so intolerable that the chairman of the Political Committee had to interrupt him and reprimand him.

The representative of Peru supported the US position on the issue of membership and purpose of the political conference.

The next speaker was Indonesian representative, Zonderoni Goro. He expressed regret that the Political Committee rejected the Soviet proposal to not invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to the meeting of the Political Committee. He said that if representatives of these two countries had participated in the meeting, it would have helped the Political Committee resolve the disputes that were hindering the progress of the work. He favored holding a round table conference and opposed holding bilateral meetings. He criticized the fifteen-nation proposal, led by the United States, on the issue of membership in the political conference, and he supported the participation of the Soviet Union and India in the conference.

Next, the head of the Byelorussian delegation, K. Kiselev, spoke. He spoke about the speeches of the Cuban and Brazilian representatives. The Cuban and Brazilian representatives said that they would vote against India's participation in the conference because Lee Seung-man had threatened to withdraw from the conference if India participated in the political conference. Kiselev said that it seemed that the issue of membership in the political conference depended entirely on the so-called President of South Korea. The Byelorussian delegation believes that there is no reason to prevent India from participating in the political conference. It is well known that Lee Seung-man also opposed the armistice agreement and demanded that the war continue until the armed interventionists captured North Korea. Of course, this situation should be the responsibility not only of the Lee Seung-man group, but also of its masters, because they condoned Lee Seung-man's provocative actions.

Kiselev said: The Political Committee must take into account the increasingly strong demands of people all over the world to stop all kinds of provocative actions and to support the peace-loving policies of the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Kiselev pointed out: The so-called mutual defense treaty concluded between the United States and the Lee Seung-man government threatens the political conference that has not yet been convened. He said: The statement issued by Dulles and Lee Seung-man on August 7, 1953, shows that they are trying to force the political conference to accept their suggestions and decisions. The fact that the United States concluded this treaty with South Korea shows that the reactionary groups in the United States are still unwilling to accept the failure of their adventure in Korea.

The Byelorussian representative supported the Soviet proposal. He pointed out that the purpose of this proposal is to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and it fully meets the demands of the people all over the world.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: TASS, New York, August 26th -- The UN General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion of the Korean question on the morning of August 25th. The first speaker was Iraqi representative al-Khalidi. He supported the participation of India and the Soviet Union in the Korean political conference. However, he opposed the Soviet proposal on the composition of the conference.

The representative of Abyssinia also supported India's participation in the political conference.

New Zealand representative Munro supported the fifteen-nation proposal and also supported the participation of the Soviet Union and India in the political conference. He said that excluding India from the conference risked making the political conference unsuccessful. He also said that if the UN General Assembly succumbed to pressure from South Korea, the Assembly would thereby abandon its responsibility.

Mexican representative Collina supported India's participation in the political conference. He said that if South Korea were allowed to arbitrarily restrict the UN General Assembly's power to make recommendations on the membership of the political conference, it would create a dangerous precedent.

Syrian representative Zeineddine, who spoke next, said that the composition of the political conference should facilitate a peaceful resolution of the issue, and therefore neutral countries must participate in the conference. He insisted on letting India participate in the conference, and at the same time advocated for the Soviet Union's participation.

Uruguayan representative Fabregat and Australian representative Spender supported the fifteen-nation proposal.

Spender opposed the Soviet proposal and the Indian proposal – that the UN Secretary-General be requested to notify the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of the various proposals and discussions on the Korean question in the General Assembly.

The last speaker at the morning meeting was the representative of Colombia, who opposed India's participation in the political conference.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: TASS, New York, August 26th -- The UN General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion of the Korean question on the afternoon of August 25th.

The first speaker was the Burmese representative, Barrington. He criticized the speech of the South Korean representative, Byun Young-tae, on August 24, pointing out that this speech did not take into account the actual situation in Korea. Barrington hoped that the political conference would not only discuss the Korean issue, but also, if possible, discuss other issues.

When discussing the issue of membership of the political conference, Barrington emphasized that the composition of the political conference should ensure a harmonious atmosphere at the conference, and certain neutral countries should participate in the political conference.

He criticized the fifteen-nation proposal, believing that the purpose of the fifteen-nation proposal was not to create a favorable atmosphere, because this proposal stipulated that the participants in the conference should be divided into two camps.

Barrington strongly insisted that India participate in the political conference. He said that if a concession were made to Lee Seung-man on this issue, it would be tantamount to insulting the dignity of the United Nations, would undermine the prestige of the United Nations before all of Asia, and would condone Lee Seung-man's adoption of the same tactics at the political conference.

Barrington then spoke about the Soviet proposal. He said that, in general, the proposal conformed to the views of the Burmese government. However, Barrington said that he was willing to propose certain amendments.

He said that if his amendments were not accepted, the Burmese government would have to consider the Soviet proposal to be unsatisfactory. He expressed support for the proposal co-signed by Burma. This proposal suggested that the UN Secretary-General notify the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of the General Assembly's recommendations.

The next speaker was the head of the Soviet delegation, A.Y. Vyshinsky, who criticized the fifteen-nation proposal.

    联合国大会政治委员会继续讨论朝鲜问题
    维辛斯基发言批评十五国提案
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十五日讯：八月二十四日下午，联合国大会政治委员会继续讨论朝鲜问题。发言的有李承晚集团代表和秘鲁、印度尼西亚、白俄罗斯代表。李承晚集团代表支持美国代表的声明，主张印度不应参加政治会议。他把发言的大部分都用来对印度政府进行粗鲁的攻击。发言的论调令人不能忍受，以致政治委员会主席不得不打断他，并对他加以指责。
    秘鲁代表支持美国在政治会议成员与目的问题上的立场。
    下一个发言的是印尼代表宗德罗尼哥罗。他对政治委员会拒绝苏联的建议，不邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国代表参加政治委员会会议一节，表示遗憾。他说，要是这两国代表参加了会议的话，就会对政治委员会解决阻碍工作进展的争执问题有所帮助了。他赞成举行圆桌会议，反对举行双方会议。他批评了以美国为首的十五国关于政治会议成员问题的提案，他赞成苏联和印度参加这一会议。
    接着，白俄罗斯代表团团长库·基谢列夫发言。他谈到古巴和巴西代表的发言。古巴和巴西代表说：他们将投票反对印度参加会议，因为李承晚曾要挟说，如果印度参加政治会议，他就要退出会议。基谢列夫说，看起来，政治会议的成员问题好像完全只取决于所谓南朝鲜总统。白俄罗斯代表团认为没有任何理由不准印度参加政治会议。大家知道，李承晚也反对停战协定，并且要求继续进行战争，直到武装干涉者夺取了北朝鲜为止。当然这种情况不仅应该由李承晚集团负责，同时也应该由它的主子负责，因为他们纵容李承晚的挑衅行为。
    基谢列夫说：政治委员会必须考虑到，全世界人民日益强烈地要求制止各种挑衅行为，并支持中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的爱好和平的政策。
    白俄罗斯代表指出：美国与李承晚政府缔结的所谓共同防御条约使尚未召开的政治会议受到威胁。他说：杜勒斯和李承晚在一九五三年八月七日发表的声明说明，他们企图强使政治会议接受他们的建议和决定。美国与南朝鲜缔结这个条约的事实说明，美国反动集团对于他们在朝鲜冒险的失败仍不甘心。
    白俄罗斯代表支持苏联提案。他指出，这个提案目的在于和平解决朝鲜问题，它完全符合于全世界人民的要求。
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：联合国大会政治委员会八月二十五日上午继续讨论朝鲜问题。第一个发言的是伊拉克代表哈里迪。他赞成印度及苏联参加朝鲜政治会议。可是，他反对苏联关于会议成员的提案。
    阿比西尼亚代表也赞成印度参加政治会议。
    新西兰代表孟罗支持十五国提案，也支持苏联与印度参加政治会议。他说，把印度排斥在会议之外有使政治会议开得不成功的危险。他还说，假如联合国大会向南朝鲜的压力屈服，大会就因此放弃了自己的责任。
    墨西哥代表柯林纳赞成印度参加政治会议。他说，假如让南朝鲜得以蛮横地限制联合国大会对于政治会议成员提出建议的权力的话，这就创立了一个危险的先例。
    继起发言的叙利亚代表宰尼丁说，政治会议的组成应该要便利于和平解决问题，因此中立国家必须参加这个会议。他坚持让印度参加会议，同时主张苏联参加。
    乌拉圭代表法布雷加特与澳大利亚代表斯宾德支持十五国提案。
    斯宾德反对苏联的提案以及印度的建议——即请联合国秘书长把大会上关于朝鲜问题的各项提案与讨论情况通知中华人民共和国以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的建议。
    在上午会议上最后发言的是哥伦比亚代表，他反对印度参加政治会议。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：八月二十五日下午，联合国大会政治委员会继续讨论朝鲜问题。
    第一个发言的是缅甸代表巴林顿。他批评南朝鲜代表卞荣泰在八月二十四日的发言，指出这个发言没有考虑到朝鲜局势的实际情况。巴林顿希望政治会议不仅讨论朝鲜问题，可能的话，也要讨论其他问题。
    谈到政治会议的成员问题时，巴林顿强调说，政治会议的组成应该保证会议上有一种和谐的气氛，某些中立国家应该参加政治会议。
    他批评了十五国提案，认为十五国提案的目的并不是要造成一种有利的气氛，因为这个提案规定把会议的参加者划分为两个阵营。
    巴林顿竭力坚持让印度参加政治会议。他说，如果在这个问题上对李承晚让步，便等于侮辱了联合国的尊严，便会在全亚洲之前破坏联合国的威信，并会纵容李承晚在政治会议上采取同样的手段。
    巴林顿接着谈到苏联提案。他说，就提案的一般来说，这个提案符合于缅甸政府的见解。然而，巴林顿说，他愿意提出某些修正。
    他说，假如他的修正案不被接受，缅甸政府就不得不认为苏联提案是不能令人满意的。他表示支持缅甸副署的提案。这个提案建议请联合国秘书长把大会的建议案通知中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    下一个发言的是苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基，他批评了十五国提案。
