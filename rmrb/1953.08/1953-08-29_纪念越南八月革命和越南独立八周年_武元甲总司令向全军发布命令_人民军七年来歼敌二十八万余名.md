Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: According to a Vietnam News Agency dispatch on August 27th, on the occasion of the anniversary of the August Revolution and the eighth anniversary of Vietnamese Independence, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, issued an order to all cadres and soldiers of the People's Army regular forces, local forces, militia, and guerrillas.

The order stated: In the past few years of arduous and heroic battles, the increasingly powerful People's Army has eliminated 280,000 enemy troops and liberated many important areas in the northern border, northeastern, and northwestern Vietnam. The order stated: Despite suffering heavy losses in manpower and material resources, the French colonialists continue to wage their war of aggression, attempting to salvage their precarious situation. They outwardly clamor for peace, but in reality, they are plotting to expand the war. They are actively expanding the puppet army, attempting to use even more despicable means to implement their scheme of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese."

General Vo Nguyen Giap said in the order: On this glorious day for our people and army, I order all cadres and soldiers of the People's Army armed forces to: redouble their vigilance, further enhance their fighting spirit, resolutely annihilate more of the enemy's vital forces, and crush all enemy conspiracies; improve their ideological level, study tactics and techniques, and establish a proactive and heroic fighting style; vigorously support the peasants' struggle to overthrow the traitors, rural despots, and other reactionary elements, and ensure the complete victory of this struggle; intensify guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear, and use all means to crush the enemy's scheme of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese."

The order concluded with the slogans: "Long live the spirit of the August Revolution!" "Long live the independence and unification of Vietnam!" "Long live President Ho Chi Minh!"

Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: According to the "Vietnam News" published by the Vietnamese Embassy in China on August 25th, the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army recently issued a comprehensive bulletin on the war achievements of the Vietnamese People's Army in the anti-aggression war over the past seven years (from December 19, 1946, to July 20, 1953) as follows:
