Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th. The Soviet government's announcement regarding the Soviet Union's successful explosion test of a type of hydrogen bomb has provoked extensive commentary in various countries around the world.

    Progressive newspapers in various countries have published this announcement on the front page, expressing their satisfaction that it is proof of the Soviet Union's strength and a victory for the camp of peace and democracy. These newspapers point out that this announcement is a blow to the aggressive bloc that relies on the United States' monopoly of atomic and hydrogen bombs as the basis of their policies. For example, China's "Xinwen Ribao" (News Daily) said in an article, "The government announcement on the hydrogen bomb test published by the Soviet newspaper is an effective sobering agent for warmongers. It is a very timely and powerful warning to those gentlemen and generals who are dizzy and blindly believe in 'strength' and vainly attempt to launch new war adventures." The British "Daily Worker" published an editorial stating that any idea that the United States was the monopolist of the hydrogen bomb has been shattered. This fact is a victory for peace and gives new impetus to the struggle to ban atomic weapons. Czechoslovakia's "Zemedelske Noviny" (Agricultural Newspaper) pointed out that not long ago, the myth of the United States' atomic bomb monopoly was shattered by the news from Moscow that the Soviet Union also had atomic bombs. After the shameful failure of its atomic policy, American imperialists attempted to pursue a so-called hydrogen bomb policy, but this has also been defeated.

    Many bourgeois newspapers appear very flustered and obviously want to reduce the importance of the Soviet government's announcement on the hydrogen bomb, attempting to make people doubt the fact that the Soviet Union has mastered the hydrogen bomb secret. For example, the Canadian "Ottawa Citizen" published a Washington dispatch on the front page stating that American experts doubt whether the Soviet Union has truly produced one of these terrible weapons. A "Wall Street Journal" editorial also said that American atomic experts are somewhat skeptical of the Soviet government's announcement because, as far as they know, there are no signs of a hydrogen bomb explosion.

    It must be pointed out that the Soviet government's announcement regarding the Soviet Union's hydrogen bomb test has placed some political leaders in a very embarrassing situation. They had recently expressed doubts about the statement by Soviet government leader Malenkov that "the United States is no longer the monopolist in the production of hydrogen bombs." For example, according to a Reuters report, US Secretary of State Dulles said on August 12th, "As far as the hydrogen bomb is concerned, we can only view the Soviet Premier's remarks in this regard with some skepticism. We have no direct evidence to confirm the correctness of this statement." However, after the Soviet newspaper published the Soviet government's announcement, UPI and AP published a statement by Lewis Strauss, Chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. He said: "The Soviet Union conducted an atomic test on the morning of August 12th. We received some information about this that night." He went on to say that the information later received by the United States "indicated that this test included (atomic) fission and thermonuclear reactions." Strauss's statement refuted Dulles's statement.

    Now, we can understand the attitude of those "skeptics" who are trying to make people doubt the Soviet government's announcement about hydrogen weapons.

    According to AP reporter Hightower in Washington, the Soviet Union's "latest sign of development" in atomic weapons "forces governments around the world to consider this new and grim fact when formulating policies: that the Soviet Union may be about to contend for the atomic energy advantage that the West has enjoyed until now." According to AP reporters in Washington, Representative Cole, Chairman of the Congressional Atomic Energy Committee, convened an emergency meeting of the committee members "because scientific observers speculate that the Russian's experiments with thermonuclear reactions in the hydrogen bomb may be more effective than those of the United States." According to a UPI reporter, Cole stated in another statement that the significance of the Soviet hydrogen bomb should not be underestimated.

    The "New York Times," however, is focusing on using its usual news racketeering to create panic, making its readers believe that the Soviet Union's mastery of the hydrogen bomb secret supposedly constitutes a threat to the peaceful existence of all countries. The newspaper said, "The first problem facing the United States is the fact that the United States has more vulnerable hydrogen bomb targets than any other country."

    According to the "New York Daily News," the confirmation that the Soviet Union possesses the hydrogen bomb "is not good news. Obviously, the only thing we can do is continue to arm."

    However, more sober opinions are also more frequently coming from bourgeois newspapers. For example, when reporting the news of the Soviet hydrogen bomb test, the French "Le Monde" said: "The point emphasized by the Soviet Union is that the world should not be alarmed by the fact that the Soviet Union possesses the hydrogen bomb. When the Soviet government announced this fact, it reassured the world in its announcement, telling them not to panic, and expressed the Soviet Union's determination to continue to fight for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction." The British "Evening News" also published an editorial saying: "Russia, in announcing the hydrogen bomb explosion test, also issued words of reassurance, believing that there is no need for the West to panic, 'because the Soviet Union's policy is a policy of peace.'" The Greek newspaper "Alaghi" commented on the Soviet hydrogen bomb test, saying, "Although the Soviet Union now possesses the hydrogen bomb, it has announced that it will continue to pursue a policy of peace. The hydrogen bomb test has made a deep impression in the West."

    Many foreign newspapers have pointed out that the Soviet Union has once again demonstrated its position based on its consistent policy aimed at consolidating peace and strengthening the security of all peoples. Poland's "Trybuna Ludu" said: "The Soviet Union possesses atomic weapons, but it has always been and remains striving to ban such weapons. Now, the Soviet government possesses hydrogen weapons, and it has once again demonstrated its position based on its consistent policy of consolidating peace and strengthening the security of all peoples." The "Times of India" said that the new shift in the balance of atomic power helps to firmly establish effective international supervision of atomic energy, which will ensure that atomic energy is dedicated solely to peaceful purposes.

    While publishing reactionary clamors, some American newspapers had to admit that a good opportunity has arrived to discuss atomic and hydrogen weapons as weapons of mass destruction. For example, an editorial in the "Washington Post" said that due to new developments, "new efforts to prevent atomic weapons from being used for military purposes are essential. We do not want to minimize the difficulty of seeking a satisfactory agreement with the Soviet Union, but these difficulties are not as frightening as the consequences of failure." The Greek "Aki" newspaper used the headline "Those who think the Soviet Union's peace policy is a sign of weakness are wrong. Despite possessing the hydrogen bomb, the Soviet government continues to propose banning all weapons of mass destruction. The dream of an atomic blackmail policy has been shattered." when reporting the news of the Soviet hydrogen bomb test.

    世界舆论重视苏联政府关于氢弹试验公告
    各国进步报纸认为这是苏联强大的证明
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府关于苏联已经作了一种类型的氢弹的爆炸试验的公告，引起了世界各国广泛的评论。
    各国进步报纸都以第一版地位登载了这篇公告，表示它们满意地认为这是苏联强大的证明，是和平和民主阵营的胜利，各报指出，这篇公告对于以美国的原子弹和氢弹垄断作为它们的政策的依靠的侵略集团是一个打击。例如，中国“新闻日报”在一篇文章中说，“苏联报纸发表的关于氢弹试验的政府公告，是对好战分子一付有效的清醒剂。对那些昏头昏脑、迷信‘实力’妄想发动新的战争冒险的绅士、将军们来说，是一个很及时而有力的忠告。”英国“工人日报”发表社论说：以为美国是氢弹垄断者的任何想法都已经破灭了，这个事实是和平的胜利，它给禁止原子武器的斗争以新的动力。捷克斯洛伐克的“农业报”指出，不久前美国的原子弹垄断的神话曾由于莫斯科的消息——苏联也有原子弹——而粉碎了。在原子政策可耻地失败以后，美国帝国主义者企图奉行所谓氢弹政策，然而这又遭到了失败。
    许多资产阶级报纸显得很慌张，并且显然想减低苏联政府关于氢弹公告的重要意义，企图使人们怀疑苏联掌握了氢弹秘密这一事实。例如，加拿大
    “公民报”就在第一版登载一则华盛顿消息说：美国专家怀疑苏联是不是真正已经生产了这种可怕的武器中的一种。“华尔街日报”社论也说，美国原子专家有点怀疑苏联政府的公告，因为据他们所知，并没有氢弹爆炸的迹象。
    不能不指出，苏联政府的关于苏联试验氢弹的公告，使某些政治领袖处于很为难的境地。他们最近还表示怀疑苏联政府领袖马林科夫关于“美国在氢弹的生产方面也不是垄断者了”的声明呢。例如，根据路透社报道，美国国务卿杜勒斯八月十二日说，“就氢弹而论，我们只能带着几分怀疑来看待苏联总理关于这方面的谈话。我们没有直接的证据来证实这种说法的正确性。”然而，在苏联报纸登载了苏联政府的公告后，合众社和美联社就发表了美国原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯的声明。他说：“苏联已经在八月十二日早晨进行了原子试验。那一天晚上我们得到了关于这一方面的某些情报”。他接着说，美国后来接到的情报，“表明这次试验包括
    （原子）分裂和热核子的反应。”斯特劳斯的这个声明驳倒了杜勒斯的声明。
    现在，我们可以了解那些企图使人们怀疑苏联政府关于氢武器的公告的“怀疑分子”的态度了。
    据美联社驻华盛顿记者海托华说，苏联在原子武器方面的“发展的这个最近的迹象，使世界各国政府在制订政策时必须考虑到这一新的冷酷的事实，就是：苏联可能要争夺西方迄今还享有的原子能优势了”。据美联社记者的华盛顿消息，国会原子能委员会主席柯尔召集委员会的委员们开紧急会议，“因为据科学观察家们猜测，俄国人在氢弹的热核子反应方面所作的试验，可能比美国的试验更为有效”。据合众社记者说，柯尔在另一个声明中表示，不应该轻视苏联氢弹的意义。
    “纽约时报”则一心使用它所惯用的新闻讹诈，企图制造惊慌，使它的读者相信，苏联掌握了氢弹秘密据说构成了对各国和平生存的威胁。该报说，
    “摆在美国面前的第一个问题就是这一事实：美国有着比任何其他国家为多的易受攻击的氢弹目标。”
    据“纽约每日新闻”说，苏联拥有氢弹这一事实之被证实，“不是一个好消息，显然，我们所能做的唯一的事就是继续武装。”
    但是，从资产阶级报纸也更经常地传来比较清醒的意见。例如，法国“世界报”在报道苏联氢弹试验的消息时说：“苏联强调的一点就是：世人不要因苏联拥有氢弹这一事实而感到惊慌。当苏联政府宣布这一事实时，它在公告中叫世人安心，叫他们不要惊慌，并表示苏联决心继续为禁止大规模毁灭的武器而斗争。”英国“新闻晚报”也发表社论说：
    “俄国在宣布氢弹爆炸试验的同时还发表了安慰之辞，认为西方没有惊慌的必要，‘因为苏联的政策是和平的政策’。”希腊报纸“阿拉许报”评论苏联的氢弹试验说，“虽然苏联现在拥有氢弹，但是它宣布它将继续奉行和平政策。氢弹试验在西方造成了深刻的印象。”
    许多外国报纸指出，苏联再一次表明了它的从旨在巩固和平和加强各国人民的安全的不变政策出发的立场。波兰“人民论坛报”说：“苏联拥有原子武器，但它过去一向是、现在仍然是力求禁止这种武器的。现在，苏联政府拥有氢武器，它再一次表明了它的从巩固和平和加强各国人民安全的不变政策出发的立场。”“印度时报”说，原子能均势的新的改变，有助于坚决地把有效的原子能国际监督建立起来，这种监督将保证原子能专用于和平目的。
    某些美国报纸在发表反动叫嚣同时，也不得不承认：把作为大规模毁灭的武器的原子武器和氢武器来讨论的良机已经来到了。例如，“华盛顿邮报”的社论说，由于新的发展，“防止原子武器用在军事方面的新努力已十分必要了。我们不想把和苏联谋取一个令人满意的协议的困难说得很小，但是这些困难并没有失败的后果那样令人害怕。”希腊的“阿基报”在刊载苏联作氢弹爆炸试验的消息时所用的标题是：“那些以为苏联的和平政策是软弱的表示的人们错了。尽管拥有氢弹，苏联政府仍继续建议禁止一切大规模毁灭的武器。原子讹诈政策的梦想已经破灭了。”
