Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: Li Honggen, a returned Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war from the Busan U.S. Dongnae POW camp, revealed the truth about the U.S. connivance with the Li Seung-man and Kuomintang gangsters in forcibly detaining our captured personnel with concrete facts.

According to Li Honggen, the Dongnae POW camp held prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The officer in charge of guarding the POW camp was an American officer named Morgan, with Li Seung-man's puppet army serving as guards.

On the night of June 17th, Li's puppet soldiers cut the barbed wire surrounding the POW camp and threw the pliers to the Kuomintang secret agents inside the POW camp. These secret agents, after cutting the inner barbed wire, threatened the captured Korean People's Army personnel to come out, forcing them to board the five cars waiting outside and transporting them away.

In the past, if a person escaped from the POW camp, the U.S. military would chase them everywhere in jeeps, and all captured personnel would be gathered for a search. However, the day after this incident occurred, the American officer only took a squad leader to look around the POW camp, smiled at the people, and left. The cut barbed wire remained open. On the night of the 18th, the U.S. squad leader simply opened the gate, allowing Li Seung-man's gangster agents to take away another group of captured Korean People's Army personnel.

On the night of the 19th, although the Li puppet soldiers guarding the POW camp were replaced by U.S. troops, at the same time, Kuomintang agents were allowed by the U.S. military to enter each small barbed wire enclosure to coerce the captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel to leave the POW camp. By the morning of the 21st, the Kuomintang agent Fei Yulin threatened the captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel, saying, "The Americans want to release you. Anyone who doesn't leave is a Communist and will be killed." After breakfast, the U.S. Staff Sergeant squad leader came to shout, "Go! Go!" More than twenty captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel were driven out of the barbed wire by the agents. At this time, the U.S. soldiers carrying automatic rifles turned their backs, pretending not to see, and only after the captured personnel had been driven far away did a U.S. military vehicle slowly drive out, fire a few shots into the sky, and return. After 4:00 PM, the U.S. soldiers again told the captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel to leave the POW camp with their blankets, and also gave them toothpaste, toothbrushes, and paper-wrapped peanut candies; at the same time, the U.S. military had already set up machine guns outside the barbed wire and threw tear gas, urging: "Go! Go!" The captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel were thus driven out of the camp by Kuomintang agents with the assistance of the U.S. military. At that time, Morgan was watching outside the barbed wire, and an American was taking pictures.

Li Honggen and other captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel were then押送 (yāsòng - escorted/taken under guard) by Kuomintang agents to the "South Korean Gendarmerie" five li away. After dark, two cars載 (zài - carried) them to the Dongnae puppet police station. The next day, a person wearing a yellow Zhongshan suit, claiming to be sent by the so-called "Chinese Embassy" of the Kuomintang gangsters, came to them and said, "We are going to send you to Taiwan." He also issued each person a set of civilian clothes worn by overseas Chinese and one hundred yuan of puppet currency. Then, they were sent to the Dongnae "Changchun Garden" restaurant, filled out a "Temporary Registration Form for Overseas Chinese," and finally were sent to live in the homes of overseas Chinese. Li Honggen was sent to the home of an overseas Chinese at 42 Tucheon-dong power-sign in Busan.

Li Honggen, unwilling to go to Taiwan, found a way to escape back to the POW camp and was repatriated on the 13th of this month.

    我方归来人员李洪根提供确凿的事实
    揭露美方纵容李蒋匪帮强迫扣留战俘
    【新华社开城十六日电】从釜山美方东莱战俘营中归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员李洪根以确凿的事实揭露了美方纵容李承晚和国民党匪帮强迫扣留我方被俘人员的真相。
    据李洪根说，东莱战俘营中拘禁着朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员，负责看管战俘营的是一个美军军官摩根，由李承晚伪军担任警戒。
    六月十七日深夜，李伪军剪断了战俘营外围的铁丝网，并且把钳子扔给战俘营里面的李承晚匪帮特务分子。这些特务分子在剪断了里面的铁丝网后，就威胁朝鲜人民军被俘人员出来，强迫他们乘上早就等在外面的五辆汽车，把他们运走了。
    过去战俘营里跑掉了一个人，美军就乘吉普车到处追捕，全体被俘人员都要集合起来遭到搜查。可是这次事情发生后的第二天，美国军官却只带了一个班长到战俘营周围看了一下，见了人笑笑就走了。被剪开的铁丝网口仍然敞开着。十八日夜晚，美军班长索性把大门打开，让李承晚匪帮特务分子又拉走了一批朝鲜人民军被俘人员。
    十九日晚上，看守战俘营的李伪军虽然由美军接替，但在同时，国民党特务却得到美军允许，进入每个小铁丝网围场，在中国人民志愿军被俘人员中进行胁迫他们离开战俘营的活动。到二十一日早晨，国民党特务费玉林便威胁中国人民志愿军被俘人员说：“美国人要放你们，谁不走就是共产党，就要杀死。”早饭后，美军上士班长就来喊：“快走！快走！”二十多个中国人民志愿军被俘人员被特务赶出了铁丝网。这时，背着自动步枪的美军士兵却背转身去，假装没有看见，只在被俘人员已经被赶出很远了的时候，才有一辆美军汽车慢吞吞地开出来，朝天空打了几枪就回去了。到下午四点多钟，美军士兵又叫中国人民志愿军被俘人员带着毯子离开战俘营，还送给他们牙膏、牙刷和包着纸的花生糖；同时，美军在铁丝网外已经架好了机关枪，并向里面投掷毒气弹，催着：“快走！快走！”中国人民志愿军被俘人员就这样被国民党特务在美军协助下赶出了营场。当时，摩根就在铁丝网外看着，还有一个美国人在拍照。
    李洪根和其他中国人民志愿军被俘人员当时就被国民党特务押到五里地外的“韩国宪兵队”，天黑以后，有两辆汽车把他们载到东莱的伪警察局。第二天，有一个穿着黄色中山服，自称是国民党匪帮的所谓“中国大使馆”派来的人，前来对他们说：“我们要把你们送到台湾去。”他还发给每人一套华侨穿的便衣和一百元伪币。接着，他们又被送到东莱“长春园”餐厅，填写了“华侨临时登记表”，最后被分别送到华侨家里去住。李洪根被送到釜山市土城洞力牌四十二番地的一个华侨家里。
    李洪根因不愿到台湾去，设法逃回了战俘营，在本月十三日被遣返归来。
