Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 20th: On the 20th, our side repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war and 300 Korean prisoners of war to the other side. Among the non-Korean prisoners of war, there were 60 American prisoners of war and 90 British prisoners of war. The total number of prisoners of war repatriated by our side to the other side was 450, which is 50 more than the number stipulated in the agreement.

Today, the other side did not repatriate any captured personnel from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to our side.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 19th: Since the Korean-Chinese side lodged a serious protest on August 14th against the United Nations Command's persecution and abuse of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war during the repatriation process, demanding that the United Nations Command immediately cease such atrocities, the United Nations Command has continued to act perversely, continuing to inflict shocking violence and humiliation on Korean-Chinese prisoners of war by using inhumane methods such as releasing poisonous gas and pouring boiling water. For example:

	(1) Among the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war repatriated on August 14th, 20 were burned on their faces, chests, or limbs by the United Nations Command with poison gas bombs during repatriation. The injured areas were swollen and blistered, some with charred skin and rotten muscles, a truly tragic sight. Women and children also suffered the same tragic fate.

	(2) On August 14th, at 3:00 PM, the United Nations Command surrounded Korean-Chinese prisoners of war with a company of armed forces at the Changdan temporary prisoner of war camp and threw a large number of poison gas bombs at them, causing more than 120 Korean-Chinese prisoners of war to be poisoned and faint. It took eleven and a half hours for them to regain consciousness.

	(3) On August 14th, 15th, and 16th, for several consecutive days, the United Nations Command incited and instigated South Korean secret police to throw bricks and stones at Korean-Chinese prisoners of war on the way from Incheon to Yeongdeungpo. Hundreds of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war were injured, many of whom were seriously injured.

	(4) On August 17th, the United Nations Command again incited South Korean secret police near Incheon to pour boiling water on Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, causing many Korean-Chinese prisoners of war to be scalded.

	(5) According to Korean-Chinese prisoners of war who returned to the Korean-Chinese side on August 18th, after they boarded the ship in Busan, the United Nations Command even used the barbaric method of pouring large amounts of water into the cabins to persecute them, causing serious damage to their bodies.

At the prisoner of war repatriation committee meeting on August 19th, the United Nations Command was forced to admit that it had indeed used violence, even poison gas bombs, against Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, but still attempted to find excuses to defend itself shamelessly. The Korean-Chinese side solemnly pointed out that such atrocities by the United Nations Command seriously violated the principles of humanitarianism and the Geneva Convention, and are absolutely intolerable to the Korean-Chinese people and the people of the world. The United Nations Command will never escape the responsibility for such atrocities.

    朝中方面八月二十日继续遣返战俘
    我方严正抗议美方迫害我方归来人员
    【新华社开城二十日电】二十日，我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百五十名，朝鲜籍战俘三百名。在非朝鲜籍战俘中包括美国籍战俘六十名，英国籍战俘九十名。我方遣送给对方的战俘总数为四百五十名，较协议规定的数字多五十名。
    今天，对方没有遣送给我方朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员。
    【新华社开城十九日电】自朝中方面于八月十四日严重抗议联合国军方面在遣返战俘过程中迫害与虐待朝中被俘人员，要求联合国军方面立即停止此类暴行后，联合国军方面仍怙恶不悛，继续以放毒气、泼开水等惨无人道的办法，对朝中被俘人员施以骇人听闻的暴力和污辱。例如：
    （一）八月十四日被遣返的朝中被俘人员中，有二十名在遣返途中，被联合国军方面用毒气弹烧伤了他们的面部、胸部或四肢，受伤之处均发肿、起泡，其中有的皮肤烧焦，肌肉腐烂，其状惨不忍睹，妇女、小孩也遭受同样惨害。
    （二）八月十四日，下午三时，联合国军方面在长湍临时战俘收容所，以一个连的武装部队，包围朝中被俘人员，并向他们投掷了大量毒气弹，致使一百二十余名朝中被俘人员中毒晕倒，经过十一小时半的时间才苏醒过来。
    （三）八月十四日、十五日、十六日连续数天，联合国军方面在仁川至永登浦途中，唆使和煽动南朝鲜的特务警察，向朝中被俘人员投掷砖头石子，朝中被俘人员被打受伤者达数百人，其中多人伤势严重。
    （四）八月十七日，联合国军方面又在仁川附近，唆使南朝鲜的特务警察，向朝中被俘人员泼开水，致使许多朝中被俘人员被开水烫伤。
    （五）另据八月十八日回到朝中方面的朝中被俘人员诉称，他们自釜山上船以后，联合国军方面竟以向船舱内大量放水的野蛮手段，对他们进行迫害，使他们的身体遭受严重的损害。
    在八月十九日的战俘遣返委员会上，联合国军方面虽然被迫承认确曾对朝中被俘人员使用暴力乃至于毒气弹，但仍妄图寻找藉口，为自己作无耻的辩护。朝中方面严正指出，联合国军方面此类暴行，严重地违反了人道主义的原则和日内瓦公约，是朝中人民与全世界人民所绝不能容忍的，联合国军方面将永不能逃脱对此类暴行应负的责任。
