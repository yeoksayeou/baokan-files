The Shanghai Branch of the All-China Federation of Art Workers held the 1953 Chinese Painting Exhibition at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Hall from August 3rd to 14th, which was warmly welcomed by more than 37,000 visitors.

This exhibition was held with the significance of promoting the excellent traditions of national art and advancing the creation of new Chinese paintings. As early as three months ago, Chinese painters in the city began to create. After viewing and evaluation, 350 works were selected to participate in the exhibition. Most of them are works reflecting new things and new atmospheres in the motherland and depicting the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland.

After the opening of the exhibition, Chen Yi, the Mayor of Shanghai, and Shu Tong, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the East China Administrative Council, visited. Chen Yi also selected several paintings, such as "Presenting Horses to Commander-in-Chief Zhu," and wrote an inscription for the Chinese Painting Exhibition, saying: "One hundred and eighty-three painters have provided more than three hundred new works, and their creative direction is to serve the construction of new China, which is very correct. ... The development of new China's construction enables the broad masses of people to demand cultural supplements in addition to production labor and work. I hope that our writers, artists, musicians, and dramatists can undertake this cultural supplement task for the people to the highest and greatest extent." This inscription gave the Chinese painters great encouragement. During the exhibition, the audience selected and purchased 249 Chinese paintings, and another 138 works were scheduled to be reproduced by Chinese painters. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中华全国美术工作者协会上海市分会举行国画展览会
    中华全国美术工作者协会上海市分会自本月三日起至十四日止在中苏友谊馆举行一九五三年国画展览会，受到三万七千多观众热烈欢迎。
    这次展览是在发扬民族艺术优良传统，推进新国画创作的意义下举行的。早在三个月前全市国画家即开始创作，经过观摩与评选后，选出作品三百五十件参加展览。其中大部分是反映祖国新事物、新气象和描写祖国锦绣河山的作品。
    展览会开幕后，上海市市长陈毅，华东行政委员会文化教育委员会主任舒同等都去参观，陈毅还选购了“向朱总司令献马”等图画数幅，并为国画展览会题词说：“百八十三位画家，提供三百余件新作品，其创作方向是为新中国的建设服务，这是很正确的。……新中国建设之发展，使广大人民在生产劳动与工作之余，要求文化补给。我希望我们的文学家、美术家、音乐家、戏剧家等能为人民在极高、和最大的限度上承担这个文化补给的任务。”这个题词给了国画家们以很大的鼓舞。展览会展出期间，观众选购了国画二百四十九件，另外预定请国画家复制的作品有一百三十八件。    （新华社）
