The Jinlan Township Electoral Group Adopted a Mixed Grouping Method with Good Results

In the general election in Jinlan Township, Miao Autonomous Region of Damaoshan, Guangxi Province, the adoption of a mixed grouping method for electoral groups achieved good results.

Jinlan Township is one of the key experimental townships for the general election in the Damaoshan Miao Autonomous Region. The entire township consists of one hundred and twenty-five households, with a population of five hundred and nineteen people. Among them, 107 households are Miao, with 447 people; 7 households are Dong, with 30 people; 1 household is Zhuang, with 5 people; and 10 households are Han, with 37 people. Because the Miao population is the largest, a Miao autonomous township government was established when regional autonomy was implemented. The township's general election work began with the slogan "Crash Transplanting, Welcome the General Election." The masses, through practical actions of crash transplanting, completed the transplanting work in four to eight days. Subsequently, household registration and voter registration were completed under the principles of no duplication, no omission, accuracy, and correctness. The final number of confirmed voters was 143 men and 145 women. In order to take into account the relatively complex ethnic composition and dispersed population, to ensure gender equality and fully promote democracy, and also considering the shortcomings of the original administrative groups, and based on the opinions of the masses, it was decided to form electoral groups based on the following conditions: 1. All family voters should be broken up and grouped separately, that is, those with father-son, mother-daughter, and mother-in-law relationships should be grouped separately; 2. Those with close kinship ties should be grouped separately; 3. Those who still have private feuds and old grudges should be grouped separately; 4. Young people should be grouped together, or young people and middle-aged people, middle-aged people and elderly people should be grouped together, but the principle of not being too dispersed should be followed; 5. Consideration should be given to the different customs of the various ethnic groups; 6. The opinions of male and female activists should be solicited and they should be appropriately assigned to various groups. Each electoral group consists of nine to fifteen people, with a total of twenty-two groups. This is the basic organizational unit for carrying out general election activities. After this grouping, the constraints of elders and the traditional restrictions centered on men were eliminated, and the past habits of each family sending representatives to meetings and women not being involved in affairs were corrected. Now all voters come to the meetings, and those who did not speak in the past now enthusiastically participate in discussions. When the women of the second group discussed the candidates for representatives, they automatically gathered together and proposed a female candidate. For every meeting, not only the young people, but also the women came early singing mountain songs, and the elderly followed the singing. Due to the appropriate distribution of activists, the past imbalance between groups was corrected. Furthermore, because consideration was given to the customs of the fraternal ethnic groups and to the voters living in scattered areas, everyone was even more satisfied. This grouping method has prompted voters to consciously and actively participate in general election activities and to feel the preciousness of the general election. Zhou Shimo's father said: "I have a voter certificate and a place to speak!" The woman Lan Meiren said: "Our women get to attend meetings and participate in elections, the Communist Party is really good!" After raising awareness, the women of the sixth group said: "In the past, we never came to meetings and didn't understand things; now we understand, and no one will dare to bully us anymore in the future!"

    金蓝乡选民小组采取混合编组办法效果很好
    广西省大苗山苗族自治区金蓝乡在进行普选中，采取了混合编组选民小组的办法，效果很好。
    金蓝乡是大苗山苗族自治区普选重点试验乡之一。全乡共一百二十五户，五百十九人。其中苗族一百零七户，四百四十七人；侗族七户，三十人；僮族一户，五人；汉族十户，三十七人。因为苗族人口最多，所以实行区域自治时建立了苗族自治的乡政权。该乡的普选工作是以“突击插秧，迎接普选”的口号开始的。群众以突击插秧的实际行动，在四天到八天内先后完成了插秧工作。接着，又在不重复、不遗漏、正确无误的原则下完成了户口调查和选民登记工作。最后确定的选民计：男一百四十三人，女一百四十五人。为了照顾民族较复杂、人口较分散的情况，为了照顾男女平等、充分发扬民主，也鉴于原有行政小组的缺点，并根据群众意见，决定根据下列条件编组选民小组：一、全家选民打散编组，即有父子、母女、公婆等关系的分开编组；二、有亲密亲属关系的分开编组；三、暂时还有私仇旧恨的分开编组；四、青年编在一起，或是青年和壮年，壮年和老年编在一起，但也以不过分分散为原则；五、照顾各兄弟民族不同的习惯；六、征求男女积极分子的意见，将他们适当分编到各组去。每一选民小组是九人到十五人，共编了二十二个小组。这就是进行普选活动的基层组织单位。这样编组以后，消除了长辈的束缚，和以男性为中心的传统的限制，纠正了过去每家派代表开会、妇女不理事的习惯。现在全体选民都来开会了，过去开会不发言的现在热烈参加讨论了。第二小组的妇女们讨论代表候选人时，自动地集中在一起，提出了妇女候选人。每次开会，青年们不必说，妇女们也很早便唱着山歌来了，老年人也跟着歌声来了。由于积极分子的适当分配，纠正了过去组与组之间的不平衡现象。还由于照顾到兄弟民族的习惯，照顾到居住分散的选民，大家更是满意。这样编组的办法，促使选民们自觉地、积极地参加普选活动，感到普选的可贵。周世模的父亲说：“我有了选民证，又有了讲话的地方！”妇女蓝妹仁说：“我们妇女得开会，又得参加选举，共产党真好啊！”第六组的妇女们在提高认识后说：“过去我们总不来开会，也不懂事；现在我们懂得了，以后那个也再不敢欺侮我们了！”            （张永坦）
