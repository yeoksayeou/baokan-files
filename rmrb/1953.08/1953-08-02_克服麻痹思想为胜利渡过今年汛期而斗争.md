    Overcome Complacency and Strive to Successfully Overcome This Year's Flood Season
    Hydraulic Engineering Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee
    In the past three years, under the correct leadership and strong assistance of the Central People's Government, cadres at all levels and the broad masses of the people in North China have carried out tenacious struggles in flood control and river management, and have achieved great results. This year's spring project in Hebei Province, involving ten special districts and fifty-two counties, mobilized 130,000 laborers, completed 13.37 million cubic meters of earthwork, and built and repaired 221 buildings and dangerous works. In Suiyuan Province, 7.7 million cubic meters of earthwork was completed in the past three years on the Yellow River embankment section in western Suiyuan. The 35-meter-high flood control dam of the Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River has been completed on schedule with the concerted efforts of all employees and the help of Soviet experts, and will play its flood control role in this year's flood season. In addition, soil and water conservation, embankment repair, and dangerous work reinforcement measures carried out in various places and river systems have greatly enhanced the ability to control sand, slow floods, and resist floods. In recent years, people's governments at all levels have improved the flood control headquarters from top to bottom, and "flood reporting stations" and "joint defense" organizations have been established in various river systems, providing reliable organizational guarantees for mobilizing laborers, preparing materials, grasping water conditions, and mutual support, laying a solid working foundation for flood control work.
    However, we must clearly recognize that our existing achievements in water conservancy construction are only partial and fundamental projects, and their role can only be "avoiding disasters in small floods and reducing disasters in large floods." As for eradicating water disasters, long-term efforts are required. Therefore, when entering the rainy season, cadres and the masses in various places must be highly vigilant and strictly prevent any thoughts of complacency and carelessness. In order to ensure this year's grain production increase and protect the safety of people's lives and property, the following points must be noted: First, the effectiveness of various river embankments is far from sufficient to cope with the potential flood volume. For example, although the Yellow River embankment in western Suiyuan has undergone repair and reinforcement projects, the historical flow of the Yellow River in western Suiyuan far exceeds the current defensive capacity of the embankments. In Hebei Province, the flood-affected area in 1950 was reduced by 50% compared with 1949, and the river repair projects played a certain role. However, the rivers have not experienced excessive floods in the past two or three years, and the embankments have not been tested. Once the guaranteed water level is exceeded, there is still a possibility of breaching. Therefore, we must make various preparations in terms of ideology and organization. We should neither overestimate the effectiveness of existing embankments, which would encourage complacency, nor underestimate them, which would create panic. Second, new situations and new problems after new construction projects. The Guanting Reservoir's flood control dam will start to control floods this year, and it will control the massive flow above Guanting, which will definitely reduce the threat to the lower reaches of the Yongding River. However, the catchment area in the mountainous area below Guanting and above Sanjiadian is only 1,700 square kilometers, and historically, flash floods caused by torrential rains have produced water levels exceeding the guaranteed flow of the Lugou Bridge, causing disasters. The floods in 1939 and 1950 are examples. Some people see the completion of the flood control dam and believe that the people on both sides of the Yongding River will no longer suffer from flood disasters, or that the Yongding River has become tame. It is wrong to have thoughts of complacency and carelessness and relax this year's flood control work. Under the principle of ensuring the safety of the capital and the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway and avoiding water disasters, we must make sufficient preparations for the flood diversion of the Xiaoqing River. At the same time, after the Guanting flood control, the number of larger floods will decrease, and the number of half-channel flows will increase. Experience has shown that half-channel flows are most likely to scour the embankment roots, making dangerous works tight and prolonging the dangerous period. This situation should also be noted. The role of the Duliujian River project is mainly to protect Tianjin and accelerate the discharge of water from the downstream depressions, while the Daqing River channel is becoming smaller and smaller, and the drainage is not smooth. If the middle reaches breach, it cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, we must accurately grasp the water conditions and make preparations for flood diversion in Xingaifang and Langouwadian when necessary. The embankments of the Duliujian River itself and the Dagang embankment have not been tested, and the soil quality of the embankment is poor. When the wind and waves are severe, it is very easy to breach. In addition, there are few villages nearby and it is difficult to transport materials, which is also a problem that cannot be ignored in flood control work. Third, the tributaries of various rivers are distributed in vast mountainous areas. If mountain torrents break out, the flow will inevitably be turbulent and destructive. The county and district people's governments in the mountainous areas must carry out publicity and education and necessary preparations to raise the vigilance of the masses. In areas where conditions permit, we must make full use of flood siltation and irrigation, flood diversion and slow flow to reduce disasters. Fourth, the plain areas have suffered greatly from waterlogging over the years. According to the statistics of water disasters in the Hebei Plain from 1949 to 1952, waterlogging disasters accounted for 60% to 70% of the disaster-affected area, more than twice the area of breaches. We must pay close attention to the disaster prevention measures in waterlogging areas and actively organize the masses to do a good job in drainage and land reclamation.
    The struggle to overcome floods in the entire region is a long-term, complex, and arduous task. During this year's flood season, we must fully educate the masses, mobilize and organize the masses, correctly analyze and grasp the actual situation, overcome complacency, and strive to successfully overcome this year's flood season.

    克服麻痹思想为胜利渡过今年汛期而斗争
    华北行政委员会水利局
    华北三年来的防汛治河工作，在中央人民政府正确领导和大力帮助下，各级干部和广大人民群众曾进行了顽强的斗争，并取得了很大的成绩。今年河北省的春季工程，十个专区五十二个县，动员了民工十三万人，作土方一、三三七万公方，修建建筑物及险工二二一处；绥远省在绥西黄河堤段三年来修堤防土方七七○万余公方；永定河官厅水库三十五公尺高的拦洪坝，在全体员工的一致努力和苏联专家的帮助下，已如期完工，在今年伏汛中将起到它的拦洪作用；此外各地和各河系进行的水土保持，整修堤坝，加固险工等措施，也大大地增强了拦砂缓洪、抗御洪水的能力。几年来各级人民政府自上而下地健全了防汛指挥部，各河系建立了“报汛站”和“联防”组织，在动员民工、准备物料、掌握水情、互相支援等项工作上，有了可靠的组织保证，给防汛工作奠定了有力的工作基础。
    但是，我们必须清楚的认识到，我们现有的水利建设的成就，仅仅是局部的治本工程，它的作用，也只能是“小水免灾，大水减灾”，至于根治水患，则须长期努力。因此，当进入雨季时，各地干部和群众，必须高度警惕，严加防范，不能存有任何麻痹大意的思想。为保证今年的粮食增产，保护人民的生命财产的安全，必须注意以下几点：第一、各河堤防的效能，比可能发生的洪水量还差的多，比如绥西黄河堤防，虽然进行了整修加固工程，而历史上绥西黄河流量，远远超过现在堤防的防御能力；河北省一九五○年水灾面积较一九四九年缩减百分之五十，各河整修工程是起了一定作用的，但是近两三年来各河并未涨发过量洪水，堤防未经考验，一旦超过保证水位，仍有溃决可能。因此，我们必须从思想上、组织上做好各项准备工作，对现有堤防效能，既不应过高估计而助长麻痹思想，也不应过低估计而造成恐惶心理。第二、新建工程后的新情况和新问题。官厅水库拦洪坝今年开始拦洪，它将控制着官厅以上的巨流，肯定要减轻永定河下游的威胁；但是官厅以下三家店以上山峡地区的集水面积仅一、七○○平方公里，而历史上曾因暴雨山洪，产生过超过芦沟桥保证流量的水位而造成灾害，一九三九年及一九五○年的水灾就是例证。有人看到拦洪坝的完成，认为从此永定河两岸人民再也不会遭受洪水灾害，或者说永定河已经变成驯服的，由此产生麻痹大意的思想，放松今年的防汛工作，是不应该的。我们在确保首都及京山铁路安全避免水患的原则下，对小清河的分洪要作足够的准备工作，同时官厅拦洪后，较大洪水次数减少，半槽水次数加多，经验证明，半槽水最易冲淘堤根，使险工吃紧，险期延长，这个情况亦应引起注意。独流减河工程的作用主要是保卫天津，加速下游淀洼泄水，而大清河河槽愈下愈小，宣泄不畅，中游决口即不能保证。因此，我们必须准确地掌握水情，必要时在新盖房和兰沟洼作好分洪的准备工作。减河本身堤防和大港围堤都未经考验，围堤的土质较坏，风浪严重时，极易溃决，加以附近村庄稀少，物料运送困难，也是防汛工作上不能忽视的问题。第三、各河上游支流分布于广大山区，倘若山洪暴发，流量必然汹涌，破坏性很大，山区的县、区人民政府，要进行宣传教育及必要的准备工作，使群众提高警惕；有条件地区，要充分利用洪水淤灌，分洪缓流，减少灾害。第四、平原地区历年因为内涝受害很大，据河北平原一九四九年—一九五二年水灾统计数字，内涝成灾即占受灾面积的百分之六十至七十，比决口成灾的面积大到一倍多，必须十分重视内涝地区的防灾措施，积极组织群众，做好排水脱地工作。
    全区战胜水灾的斗争是一个长期的、复杂的、艰巨的任务，在今年防汛期间，必须充分教育群众，发动与组织群众，正确分析和掌握现实情况，克服麻痹思想，为胜利渡过今年汛期而斗争。
