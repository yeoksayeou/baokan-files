　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 23rd: North Korean People's Army prisoners of war, Li Zaiying and Jin Jingzhi, who were injured by US military poison gas bombs, died on the 21st and 22nd respectively after ineffective treatment. So far, four of our returning personnel who were injured by US poison gas bombs have sacrificed their lives due to severe poisoning.

　　Li Zaiying had a high fever, severe breathing difficulties, cyanotic fingers and toes, hoarseness, coughing, a feeling of suffocation in the chest, and an enlarged liver upon his repatriation on the 14th. His face, buttocks, and knee joints were also burned to the second degree by poison gas bombs. Despite the meticulous treatment by our doctors, he died at 9:00 PM on the 21st. An autopsy revealed that the deceased's lungs were highly edematous, weighing 1,300 grams (normal lung weight is 500 grams), catarrhal bronchopneumonia, lung abscesses, extensive purulent inflammation of the bronchi, purulent inflammation and necrosis of the tracheal mucosa, and laryngeal edema and ulceration. These are characteristics of severe gas poisoning.

　　Jin Jingzhi died at 12:50 PM on the 22nd. After being poisoned by the gas bombs, he was also beaten by US soldiers with rifle butts, resulting in subconjunctival hemorrhage in both eyes. His other symptoms were roughly the same as those of Li Zaiying.

　　Li Zaiying and others were injured by US military poison gas bombs on August 10th at Camp No. 2 of the 15th Prisoner of War Camp on Geoje Island. According to returning personnel Wu Xilong, Pu Fulie, and others, Xi Kui, Liang Zaiyu, Jin Yongxi, Cui Longshan, Xu Rong and others died in the US 64th Hospital on the evening of the 10th and the 11th. Cui Changrong, Han Donghao and seventeen others who were repatriated with Li Zaiying and the other four victims also had serious injuries upon repatriation. Thanks to the treatment of our medical staff, with the exception of Cui Changrong who is still not out of danger, the injuries of the others have improved.

　　In addition, Park Wanji and Zhang Taiyi, two North Korean People's Army prisoners of war who returned from the US prisoner of war camp on Geoje Island on the 14th, also reside in the same hospital as the above-mentioned wounded. They are also severely poisoned by US military poison gas bombs.

　　Faced with the above facts, the US side is still denying its crimes. At the 19th meeting of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee, the US representative read a statement from the United Nations Command. The statement said: "The United Nations Command has never used poison gas in the control of prisoners of war. Non-toxic irritants have only been used when less severe methods of restoring order have proven ineffective." However, the facts are completely different from what the US side said. Taking the incident at the 15th Prisoner of War Camp on Geoje Island on August 10th as an example, according to reports from our repatriated prisoners of war, the US side violated the Geneva Convention's provisions on not harming the personal dignity of prisoners of war, and unreasonably ordered our prisoners of war to remove the collars from their military uniform shirts. When our prisoners of war did not accept this absurd order, the US side immediately mobilized a company of soldiers, under the personal leadership of US Major Basshot O’Ruton, the commander of the 15th Prisoner of War Camp, to throw a large number of poison gas bombs at our prisoners of war, causing serious deaths and injuries. From this, it can be seen that the US side's so-called "restoring order" and "non-toxic irritants" are completely lies.

### 遭受美方毒气弹严重伤害  我方归来人员又有两人死亡

    遭受美方毒气弹严重伤害
    我方归来人员又有两人死亡
    【新华社开城二十三日电】被美军毒气弹伤害的朝鲜人民军被俘人员李在应、金景植，经医治无效，在二十一日和二十二日先后死去。至此，被美军毒气弹伤害的我方归来人员已有四人因中毒严重而牺牲。
    李在应在十四日遣返归来时，即发高烧，高度呼吸困难，手指和足趾呈绀紫，嗄声，咳嗽，胸内窒闷感，肝脏胀大；脸部、臀部和两膝关节等都被毒气弹灼至二度火伤。虽经我方医生悉心治疗，延至二十一日下午九时死去。经解剖检验，死者两肺高度水肿，重量达一千三百克（正常肺重量为五百克），加答尔性支气管肺炎，肺脓疡，支气管有广范围化脓性炎症，气管粘膜有化脓性炎症及坏死，喉头浮肿和溃疡。这是猛烈性瓦斯中毒的特征。
    金景植在二十二日中午十二时五十分死去。他在中毒气弹后还曾被美军以枪托殴击，以致两眼结膜下出血，其他症状与李在应大致相同。
    李在应等都是在八月十日在巨济岛第十五号战俘营第二号营场被美军用毒气弹伤害的。据归来人员吴熙龙、朴富烈等目睹，在十日当晚和十一日，就有锡奎、梁在玉、金永熙、崔龙善、许荣等多人在美军第六十四号病院中死去。和李在应等四位牺牲者一起遣返归来的中毒者崔昌容、韩东浩等十七人，在遣返归来时伤势也很沉重，由于我方医务人员的治疗，除崔昌容一人还没有脱离危险期外，其余的伤势都已经好转。
    此外，和上述伤员同住在医院中的，还有十四日从巨济岛美方战俘营归来的人民军被俘人员朴万吉、张太益两人，他们也是美军毒气弹的严重中毒者。
    在上述事实面前，美方却仍在抵赖其罪行。在战俘遣返委员会十九日会议上，美方委员宣读了联合国军司令部的声明。声明中说：“联合国军司令部在管制战俘方面从来没有使用过毒气。只有在较少的恢复秩序的办法证明无效的时候，无毒的刺激物才被使用。”然而事实和美方所说的话完全不同。以八月十日巨济岛第十五号战俘营的事件为例，据归来的我方被俘人员报告，美方当时违反日内瓦公约关于不得损害战俘个人尊严的规定，无理命令我方被俘人员拆掉军服衬衣上的衣领，当我方被俘人员不接受美方这一荒谬命令时，美方立即调动一个连的兵力，在第十五号战俘营长官美军少校巴斯霍特·吴鲁顿的亲自领导下，向我方被俘人员投掷大量毒气弹，并造成严重死伤。由此可见，美方所谓“恢复秩序”、“无毒刺激物”等等完全是谎话。
