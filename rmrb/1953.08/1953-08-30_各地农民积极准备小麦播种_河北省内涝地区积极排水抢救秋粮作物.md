Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Farmers in major wheat-producing areas such as Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Guanzhong in Shaanxi Province, and Huaibei in Anhui Province are actively carrying out various preparations before sowing in order to strive for increased wheat production next year.

Farmers in various regions are working hard to plow the land and prepare farm tools to welcome the sowing season. Farmers in Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, generally plow the fields about half a month earlier than in previous years. On the land that has been plowed three times, the farmers meticulously harrow and roll it vertically and horizontally, and actively repair wheat sowing drills and purchase seed dressing agents in order to achieve uniform sowing and good emergence. Farmers in Shanxi Province have noticed the shortcomings of previous years, such as the cultivation was not refined enough, the sowing was not completely timely, and the fertilization was too little, which led to wheat being frozen and suffering from insect pests. They are further improving cultivation techniques. In Chuandi Township, Huguan County, wheat fields cultivated with new-style walking plows accounted for 60% of the total wheat field area in the township. Yuncheng Prefecture will expand the area of deep plowing to 12% this autumn, and the depth is generally one inch deeper than last year. At present, while draining and pruning cotton fields, farmers in the southern part of the province have generally plowed wheat fields two or three times. Farmers in Henan Province are plowing the autumn fields as they are harvested. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are preparing to modify the original two- or three-legged drills into three- or four-legged drills in preparation for close planting of wheat.

In order to ensure that the sown wheat can resist disasters and increase production next year, farmers in various regions are actively accumulating fertilizer and exchanging improved varieties. According to statistics from some areas in ten counties including Gaoping and Yishi in Shanxi Province, more than 1,123,000 dan of green manure, compost, and farmyard manure have been accumulated. Changzi County averages 80 dan of fertilizer per mu, an increase of 14.2% over the amount of fertilizer applied per mu last year. In Yuxiang, Yicheng, Quwo, Linfen and other counties in the province, where less base fertilizer was applied in previous years, one-third of the wheat fields have been fertilized early, with an average of more than 3,000 jin per mu. In the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, more base fertilizer is applied to wheat fields than last year. In Hua County, 70% of the 350,000 mu of wheat fields were fertilized last year, and this year it will reach 90%. Farmers in the Guanzhong area began to exchange improved varieties after the summer wheat harvest. Nearly 5 million mu of "Bi Ma No. 1" improved varieties will be sown in the entire area this autumn. In the low-lying and humid areas along the Wei River and in Lantian, Hancheng, Fuping, Sanyuan, Gaoling and other counties, a large number of "6028" improved varieties that resist wheat midges will be sown. The fertilizer accumulation campaign in Lingbi County, Anhui Province, was first launched in mutual aid groups. The Xu Conghui mutual aid group in Wanggang Township plans to plant 180 mu of wheat and apply 270,000 jin of fertilizer.

Party and government organs at all levels have provided strong leadership for the preparation work for increasing wheat production. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government issued instructions on autumn production work on August 24. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Provincial People's Government provided 120 million jin of wheat seeds and 190 billion yuan in loans to help farmers solve the difficulties of insufficient improved varieties, fertilizers, and farm tools. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government and various prefectures and some counties successively held meetings in August to summarize and exchange experiences in increasing wheat production, and held technical training classes in advance to guide farmers to further implement advanced farming techniques in a timely manner. Hebei Province held a 1954 wheat production increase meeting, which decided to expand the province's wheat planting area to 31 million mu, an increase of 10% over the original area this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 29th: Some areas of Hebei Province have experienced excessive rain and waterlogging. Local party and government leading organs are leading farmers to actively drain water and rescue autumn grain crops.

Since mid-July, Hebei Province has experienced continuous heavy rain, with relatively large rainfall in the eastern, southern, and northeastern regions. The rainfall in the Lulong and Luanxian areas reached more than 700 millimeters, and the rainfall in the Dongguang and Cangxian areas also exceeded 600 millimeters, resulting in water accumulation and waterlogging in many low-lying areas, and autumn crops were flooded. In order to rescue autumn grain crops, the Communist Party organizations and People's Governments at all levels in the waterlogged areas immediately determined that draining water to protect autumn crops was the overriding central task at the local level, and took various emergency measures, such as establishing joint drainage organizations between counties, districts, and villages, and mobilizing cadres to participate in the rescue. Li Ziguang, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and party and government leading cadres in the eastern and southern regions of Hebei Province went to the waterlogged areas to express their condolences and supervise. Farmers in the flood-affected areas of Ji County drained water and rescued autumn fields overnight. The Xiaolong River near Nantian Gezhuang in Daxing County breached its banks, and farmers in Weigezhuang and other villages built a horizontal dam to defend against it. As a result, the water accumulated in Nantian Gezhuang and could not be discharged. Hu Yi, secretary of the Daxing County Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally went to the area to investigate, mobilized farmers to open a gap in the river embankment in Weigezhuang, and repaired the old drainage ditch, so that the water near Nantian Gezhuang quickly flowed into the river, protecting the crops.

    各地农民积极准备小麦播种
    河北省内涝地区积极排水抢救秋粮作物
    【新华社二十九日讯】河南、河北、山西、陕西省关中、安徽省淮北等小麦主要产区的农民，为争取明年小麦增产，正积极进行播种前的各项准备工作。
    各地农民正紧张犁地和准备农具，迎接播种季节的到来。陕西省关中农民一般把犁田时间比往年提前了半月左右，在已经犁过三遍的地上，农民们又精细地纵横耙磨，并积极修补种麦耧和购买拌种药剂，以便做到播种均匀和出苗良好。山西省农民注意到已往因耕作还不精细、播种不完全适时、施肥少以致小麦受冻和遭受虫害的缺点，正进一步提高耕作技术。壶关县川底乡用新式步犁耕过的麦田，占到全乡麦田总面积的百分之六十。运城专区今秋要扩大深耕面积到百分之十二，深度一般都比去年加了一寸。目前，该省南部地区农民在进行棉田排水整枝的同时，已把麦田普遍犁过两三遍。河南省农民对大秋地正随收随犁。不少农业生产合作社和互助组正准备把原有的二、三根腿耧改制成三、四根腿耧，准备小麦密植。
    为了保证种下的小麦明年能够抗灾增产，各地农民正积极积肥和调换良种。据山西省高平、猗氏等十个县部分地区的统计，沤成的绿肥、堆肥、圈肥等已有一百一十二万三千多担。长子县每亩平均积肥八十担，比去年每亩施肥量增加了百分之十四点二。该省往年施底肥较少的虞乡、翼城、曲沃、临汾等县，已有三分之一的麦田及早施了底肥，每亩平均三千多斤。陕西省关中地区麦田施底肥的比去年增多。华县三十五万亩麦田，去年施底肥的占十分之七，今年将达到十分之九。关中地区农民在今夏麦收后即开始调换良种。全区今秋将播种近五百万亩“碧蚂一号”良种。在渭河两岸低湿地带和蓝田、韩城、富平、三原、高陵等县，将大量播种抗吸浆虫的“六零二八”良种。安徽省灵璧县的积肥运动首先在互助组中展开。该县王岗乡徐从辉互助组计划全组种麦一百八十亩，施肥二十七万斤。
    各地党政机关对小麦增产的准备工作进行了大力领导。中共河南省委员会、省人民政府在八月二十四日发出关于秋季生产工作的指示，省人民政府农林厅以一亿二千万斤麦种和一千九百亿元贷款帮助农民解决良种、肥料、农具不足的困难。山西省人民政府和各专区以及部分县，八月曾先后召开会议总结和交流了小麦增产的经验，并提前举办了技术训练班，及时指导农民进一步实行先进耕作技术。河北省曾举行一九五四年小麦增产会议，决定把全省小麦播种面积扩大到三千一百万亩，比今年原有面积增加百分之十。
    【新华社保定二十九日电】河北省部分地区雨多内涝，当地党、政领导机关正领导农民积极排水，抢救秋粮作物。
    七月中旬以来，河北省连日霪雨，东部、南部和东北部地区雨量较大。卢龙、滦县一带降雨量达七百多公厘，东光、沧县一带也超过六百公厘，以致不少低洼地带渍水成涝，秋庄稼被水淹没。为抢救秋粮作物，内涝地区的中共各级组织和人民政府，立刻确定以排水保秋为当地当前压倒一切的中心任务，采取各项紧急措施，如建立县与县、区与区、村与村间的联合排水组织，动员干部参加抢救等。中共河北省委员会农村工作部部长李子光和河北省东部、南部地区的党政领导干部都到内涝地区慰问、督导。蓟县受涝地区的农民连夜排水抢救秋田。大兴县南田各庄附近的小龙河决口，魏各庄等村农民便筑起一道横坝防御，结果水积在南田各庄泄不出去。中共大兴县委员会书记胡毅就亲自到该地勘察，动员农民在魏各庄河堤上扒开一个口子，又修整了旧泄水河沟，使南田各庄附近的水很快流入河里，保住了庄稼。
