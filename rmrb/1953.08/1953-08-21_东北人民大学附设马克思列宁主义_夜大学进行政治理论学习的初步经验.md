The Northeast People's University Affiliated Marxist-Leninist Evening University was formally established in September 1951 under the leadership of the university's Party and administrative authorities. It aims to enhance the Marxist-Leninist level of university teachers and school cadres based on advanced Soviet experience, thereby strengthening learning from the Soviet Union and improving teaching quality and work efficiency.

Before the establishment of the Evening University, our school had piloted a half-year cadre study class on "Biographies of Lenin and Stalin," gaining some preliminary experience in teaching methods such as adopting a "school year system," "regular class system," and "lecture-based with discussion as a supplement," laying the foundation for the establishment of the Evening University. To date, the Evening University has adhered to regular theoretical study, except for a semester break in the first half of 1952 due to the "Three-Anti" and ideological reform movements.

Since 1952, under the guidance of the School Work Committee of the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Evening University has gradually expanded in scale. Currently, the Evening University has a school affairs committee as its leading body, with a president and vice president each. The students are mainly teachers from various universities in Changchun, as well as cadres from secondary technical schools, government agencies, and military units. Currently, there are 993 students.

The Evening University plans to complete the study of "History of the Chinese Revolution" (i.e., systematically studying the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" around the history of the Chinese Communist Party), "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism," "Political Economy," and "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism" in four years. The study period for each course is set at one year, and students choose one course each year. The Evening University has already offered courses in "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism" and "Political Economy" (both of which ended at the end of July this year). The learning method is mainly based on lectures, supplemented by study discussions. Classes are held once every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon, each time for three hours. After each unit is completed, specific reference books are assigned, and discussion questions are formulated, which are organized by the study group leaders. Each student spends six to nine hours a week on theoretical study (including class time). The "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism" course takes the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" as the center and is taught using self-compiled outlines, appropriately combined with the actual situation of the Chinese revolution; the "Political Economy" course is based on classic works such as "Das Kapital" and "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.," with reference to the lecture notes of the Soviet Advanced Party School (the capitalist part) and the outlines compiled by Soviet experts from the Renmin University of China, and lectures are conducted using self-compiled lecture notes.

In order to strengthen the learning effect, the Evening University has successively established various learning systems over the past year: such as leave system, classroom discipline, learning reporting system, student status, etc. In addition, to check the learning effect, unscheduled notebook spot checks are often carried out. At the end of the second semester, a final test was held in the form of writing essays and answering questions.

Most of the students of the Evening University can consciously adhere to learning, and the learning mood has always been full. For example, most of the comrades in the law, accounting, and statistics teaching and research sections of our school have read the assigned reference books, take notes carefully during lectures, and prepare fully before each discussion, writing speaking outlines. They also plan their theoretical study to ensure time for theoretical learning, stipulating the specific dates of Evening University lectures and discussions on the "Teaching and Research Section Calendar," and stipulating the time for previewing, reviewing, and reading reference books in their personal "Work Progress Chart."

Since the opening of the Evening University, thanks to the attention of the school's Party and administrative leaders, the diligent teaching of teachers, and the tenacious and conscious learning of students, the learning gains have been great:

First, they have transformed their thinking and improved their political and theoretical level: Most of the students of the Evening University are teachers from universities, most of whom are old intellectuals with relatively chaotic thinking and unclear teaching views. However, on the basis of the ideological reform movement, after three semesters of theoretical study at the Evening University, their thinking and political theoretical level has been greatly improved. They have systematically understood the laws of social development, recognized that Marxism-Leninism is the foundation of all sciences, gradually abandoned some bourgeois teaching ideas of "supra-class," "pure science," and "genius teaching," exposed some absurd bourgeois theories: such as Malthus's "population theory," reformism and revisionism, and other reactionary viewpoints; corrected the teaching attitude of "managing teaching but not learning" and "not proceeding from reality," and can initially use the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to analyze problems and study problems; recognized the glory and responsibility of people's teachers, gradually established new teaching viewpoints, improved their sense of responsibility at work, and consolidated the achievements of the ideological reform movement.

Second, they have recognized the superiority of Soviet textbooks, strengthened their confidence in learning from the Soviet Union, and improved their professional level: Some teachers, before their class standpoint was changed, held a contemptuous and indifferent attitude towards Soviet textbooks and failed to recognize the importance of learning from the Soviet Union. Some teachers knew that Soviet textbooks were good, but due to the limitations of their theoretical level, they could not understand the spiritual essence of Soviet textbooks. After studying at the Evening University, as their ideological level continued to improve, they gradually realized the superiority of Soviet textbooks and strengthened their confidence in learning from the Soviet Union.

Third, most students can apply theory to practice in teaching and work, and improve the quality of teaching and work: Because the teachers of the Evening University focused on enabling students to understand the spiritual essence of the theory in their lectures and appropriately and organically combined theoretical study with real struggle, most students realized the importance of linking theory with practice and began to link theory with practice; some teachers have made systematic connections, making students feel concrete and close.

Fourth, they have improved their interest in learning theory and laid a good foundation for systematic learning of theory: Due to the persistence of regular and systematic theoretical study for more than a year, correcting the past fragmented and piecemeal study, everyone has improved their interest in theoretical study, and many students have developed theoretical study as an indispensable part of their work and daily life, and many students have developed the habit and ability of independent self-study and have begun regular theoretical study step by step.

In the year and a half of teaching work of the Evening University, and in the leadership organization of teaching, there are several experiences. Now, according to the nature of the courses taught and the problems of learning organization and leadership, they are described separately as follows:

First, the experience in the teaching of the "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism" course: Using Soviet theory and experience to study Chinese revolutionary problems and organically combining theoretical study with real struggle is one of the most effective teaching methods for the theoretical study of intellectuals.

"Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism" takes the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" as the center and is appropriately combined with the actual situation of the Chinese revolution. In explaining the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism and the Soviet socialist construction theory, Lenin's and Stalin's theoretical works and the Soviet historical experience and economic construction experience are explained in detail. In each chapter, a section is divided to systematically explain the relevant Chinese revolutionary issues. For example, when explaining the strategic basis of the Party, not only the experience and lessons of the Russian First Revolution and the historical significance of Lenin's "Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic Revolution" are explained, but also the strategic and line issues in the Chinese revolution are explained in more detail; when talking about "Soviet Socialist Agricultural Collectivization," not only the principles, principles, processes, and development directions of Soviet agricultural collectivization are fully explained, but also closely linked to the problem of China's agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, the characteristics of China's small-scale peasant economy, the Party's agricultural mutual aid and cooperation policy are explained, and the erroneous tendencies of blind advance and forced command are criticized, and the problems in China's current agricultural work are systematically explained. In this way, students have a deeper understanding of the Party's theory, policies, and major issues in current work.

Second, the experience in the teaching of the "Political Economy" course: The lectures on "Political Economy" are conducted according to the following basic principles: First, it is first clearly recognized that political economy is a historical science that studies the laws of the development of people's relations of production. Therefore, it focuses on clarifying the relationship between productive forces and relations of production in the development process of all social forms. For example, when talking about the capitalist system, we first talk about the development of productive forces under the conditions of the feudal system and the preparation for the capitalist mode of production. At the same time, it is pointed out that political economy is the ideological weapon of the proletariat in carrying out class struggle, and the theory of surplus value - the main cornerstone of Marx's economic theory - is focused on. Special importance is given to Lenin's and Stalin's theory of imperialism and the theory of the general crisis of the capitalist system; according to the theory in "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.," the characteristics of the second stage of the general crisis are further analyzed. Stalin's theory of socialist economic laws is a new great contribution to Marxist political economy. In the lectures on the socialist system, Stalin's theory is fully explained, and it is pointed out that Lenin's and Stalin's socialist political economy is the guide for the Chinese people to build their own motherland. The relationship between political economy and the Party's policies, economic laws and economic policies, and economic laws and national plans has been clearly explained. Second, the reactionary viewpoints of various bourgeois economists have been strictly criticized. For example, for Malthus's "population theory," it is pointed out how this reactionary theory has become a tool for the United States imperialism to carry out war propaganda today, and the shameless faces of new Malthusian agents Pendell, Leibu, and other bourgeois mercenary scholars are exposed. The reactionary viewpoints of revisionist Bernstein, legal Marxist Struve, Baranovsky, modern bourgeois economists Sombart, Keynes, etc., have also been criticized in connection with the relevant theoretical parts of each chapter. When talking about the chapter "The Transition Period from Capitalism to Socialism," the anti-Party erroneous viewpoints of Trotskyites, Zinovievites, Bukharinites, etc., are criticized, and their bourgeois ideological basis is pointed out. In this way, we can understand the fundamentally opposite nature of the bourgeois ideological system and the socialist ideological system. Third, in the lectures, the actual situation in China is appropriately linked. When talking about the capitalist system, China is placed in its real historical position, as a colonial and semi-colonial country under the exploitation of imperialism, and linked to the world capitalist system, that is, China used to be the object of plunder for primitive accumulation by capitalist countries, and later it has long been the commodity sales market, raw material supply base, and investment place for various imperialist countries. Here, any far-fetched historical analogies are especially avoided, and no isolated connections are made according to certain economic categories that represent various individual aspects of capitalist relations of production, such as "money," "capital," and "wages."

Third, strengthening ideological leadership is the main condition for ensuring the regular conduct of theoretical study: In the process of leading teaching, the Evening University encountered various ideological problems, such as some teachers participating in the Evening University to study theory at first because they did not have enough "capital" and came to study in order to use "new" theories to give lectures; some people had the idea of opposing theoretical study to business in their study; some teachers only wanted to study the theoretical parts related to their business, and some natural science teachers asked to study "natural dialectics" separately... Because the Party Committee and administrative leadership of our school strengthened ideological leadership, constantly conducted education, and often conducted criticism in coordination with the trade union organizational life, the above ideological tendencies were gradually corrected.

At present, there are still many problems and shortcomings in the work of the Evening University of our school, such as insufficient planning in teaching, insufficient guidance work, poor answering of questions and ideological leadership work, etc., which need to be further improved in future work.

    东北人民大学附设马克思列宁主义
    夜大学进行政治理论学习的初步经验
    东北人民大学附设马克思列宁主义夜大学教务室
    东北人民大学附设马克思列宁主义夜大学是在本校党和行政的领导下，于一九五一年九月正式创立的。它是根据苏联先进经验，以提高高等学校教师及学校机关干部的马克思列宁主义水平，从而加强向苏联学习、提高教学质量与工作效能为目的。
    在夜大学成立以前，我校曾试办过为期半年的 “列宁、斯大林传略”的干部学习班，取得了一些关于采用“学年制”“定期上课制”及以“讲课为主、讨论为辅”等教学上的初步经验，为创立夜大学打下了基础。到目前为止，夜大学除一九五二年上半年因开展“三反”及思想改造运动，停课一个学期外，一直坚持了正规的理论学习。
    夜大学自一九五二年起，在中共长春市委学校工作委员会的指导下，规模逐渐扩大。目前，夜大学以校务委员会为领导机构，设正副校长各一人。学员主要是长春市各高等学校教师，及各中等技术学校、机关、部队的干部。现在共有学员九百九十三人。
    夜大学计划在四年时间中学完“中国革命史”
    （即围绕中共党史，系统地学习“毛泽东选集”）。“马克思列宁主义基础”“政治经济学”“辩证唯物论与历史唯物论”。每门课程学习期限定为一年，学员每年选修一门课程。夜大学已开设有“马克思列宁主义基础”及“政治经济学”两门课程（均已在今年七月底结束）。学习方式以上课讲授为主，学习讨论为辅。每周星期三、六午后讲课一次，每次是三小时。每个单元讲完以后都指定一定的参考书，并拟出讨论题，由各学习小组长组织讨论，每个学员每周用于理论学习的时间，为六至九小时，
    （听课时间在内）。“马克思列宁主义基础”课是以“联共（布）党史”为中心，并适当结合中国革命实际，自编提纲进行讲授；“政治经济学”课是以
    “资本论”“苏联社会主义经济问题”等经典著作为基础，参考苏联高级党校讲义（资本主义部分）以及中国人民大学苏联专家所编写的提纲，自编讲稿，进行讲授。
    夜大学为加强学习效果，一年多以来陆续建立了各项学习制度：如请假制度、课堂纪律、学习汇报制度、学籍等。另为检查学习效果，经常进行不定期的笔记抽查。第二学期末，并曾布置以写论文及答题考试的两种方式，举行了期终测验。
    夜大学的学员大多数人都能自觉地坚持学习，学习情绪一直是饱满的。如我校法律、会计、统计教研室的大部分同志都阅读了所指定的参考书，听课时认真记笔记，每次讨论前都能充分准备，写发言提纲。他们并为保证理论学习时间，有计划地进行理论学习，将夜大学听课及讨论的具体日期规定在“教研室历”上，将预习、复习、阅读参考书的时间，规定在个人的“工作进度表”内。
    夜大学自开学以来，由于学校党、行政领导的重视，教员的努力教学和学员顽强自觉的学习，学习收获是很大的：
    第一、改造了思想，提高了政治理论水平：夜大学的学员大部分是高等学校的教师，其中多数是旧知识分子，思想比较混乱，教学观点不很明确。但是，在思想改造运动的基础上，经过三个学期夜大学的理论学习后，他们的思想和政治理论水平已大大提高了。他们系统地理解了社会发展规律，认识了马克思列宁主义是各门科学的基础，逐渐地抛弃了“超阶级”“纯科学”及“天才教学”的一些资产阶级教学思想，揭露了一些资产阶级的荒谬学说：如马尔萨斯“人口论”、改良主义和修正主义等各种反动观点；改正了“管教不管会”“不从实际出发”的教学态度，而能初步运用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法去分析问题和研究问题；认识了人民教师的光荣和职责，逐渐树立起新的教学观点，提高了工作责任心，巩固了思想改造运动的成果。
    第二、认识了苏联教材的优越性，加强了向苏联学习的信心，提高了业务水平：有的教师在阶级观点未改变前，对于苏联教材是抱着轻视和冷淡的态度，没能认识到向苏联学习的重要性。有的教师知道苏联教材是好的，但由于理论水平的限制，体会不了苏联教材的精神实质。经过夜大学学习，由于思想水平不断得到提高，他们逐渐体会了苏联教材的优越性，并由此加强了向苏联学习的信心。
    第三、多数学员能够在教学中、工作中运用理论联系实际，提高了教学及工作质量：夜大学由于教员在讲课中着重使学员理解理论的精神实质，把理论学习与现实斗争恰当地、有机地、结合起来进行讲授，因而使多数学员体会了理论联系实际的重要，开始以理论联系实际；有的教员联系得还有系统，使学生感到具体而亲切。
    第四、提高了学习理论的兴趣，奠定了系统学习理论的良好基础：由于一年多以来，坚持了正规的系统的理论学习，纠正了过去零碎、片断的学习，大家都对理论学习提高了兴趣，不少的学员已经将理论学习养成为自己工作和日常生活不可缺少的一部分，许多学员已经养成独立自修的习惯和能力，开始了循序渐进的正规的理论学习。
    夜大学在一年半的教学工作中，及在领导组织教学上，有几点体会，现在根据讲授的课程性质及学习组织领导问题，分别叙述如下：
    第一、“马克思列宁主义基础”课程教学中的体会：运用苏联的理论和经验，研究中国革命问题，把理论学习与现实斗争有机地结合起来进行讲授，是对知识分子理论学习最有效的教学方法之一。
    “马克思列宁主义基础”是以“联共（布）党史”为中心，适当地结合中国革命的实际进行讲授的。在阐述马克思列宁主义各个基本观点及苏联社会主义建设理论时，均详细讲解列宁、斯大林的理论著作及苏联的历史经验和经济建设经验。每一章中均分出一节，系统地讲解有关的中国革命问题。如讲党的策略基础时，则不但讲解了俄国第一次革命的经验和教训及列宁的“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”的历史意义，而且更详细地联系了中国革命中的策略、路线问题；在讲“苏联社会主义农业集体化”时，不但充分地讲解了苏联农业集体化的方针、原理、经过及其发展方向等，而且密切地联系了中国农业生产互助合作运动的问题，讲解了中国小农经济的特点，党的农业互助合作方针，并批判了盲目冒进、强迫命令的错误倾向，系统地讲解了中国当前农业工作中的问题。如此，使学员对党的理论、政策、当前工作中的主要问题，理解得更深刻了。
    第二、“政治经济学”课程教学中的体会：“政治经济学”的讲授，是按下述基本原则进行的：一、首先明确认识政治经济学是一门历史的科学，它研究人们生产关系发展的法则。因此着重阐明在一切社会形态发展过程中生产力与生产关系间的关系问题。如讲资本主义制度时先讲生产力在封建制度条件下的发展，资本主义生产方式的准备。同时指出政治经济学是无产阶级进行阶级斗争的思想武器，重点讲解了剩余价值理论——马克思经济学说的主要基石。对于列宁斯大林的帝国主义论，资本主义体系总危机的学说，给予了特殊重要的地位；根据“苏联社会主义经济问题”中的理论，进一步分析了总危机第二阶段的特征。斯大林关于社会主义经济法则的学说，是对于马克思主义政治经济学的新的伟大贡献。在社会主义制度部分的讲授中，全面地讲解了斯大林的学说，并指出列宁斯大林的社会主义政治经济学是中国人民建设自己祖国的指南。关于政治经济学与党的政策、经济法则与经济政策、经济法则与国家计划的关系，都做了清楚的说明。二、对资产阶级经济学者的各种反动观点，进行了严格的批判。如：对于马尔萨斯的“人口论”，指出这种反动学说今日怎样成为美帝国主义进行战争宣传的工具，揭穿了新马尔萨斯分子彭德尔、列布等资产阶级雇佣学者的无耻面目。对于修正主义者伯恩斯坦，合法马克思主义者斯特鲁威、巴兰诺夫斯基，现代资产阶级经济学者桑巴特、凯恩斯等的反动观点，也都结合各章的有关理论部分，进行了批判。在讲“从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期”这一章时，批判了托洛茨基分子、季诺维也夫分子、布哈林分子等反党的错误观点，并指出其资产阶级的思想基础。这样就了解了资产阶级思想体系与社会主义思想体系的根本对立的性质。三、在讲授中，适当地联系了中国实际。在讲资本主义制度时，把中国摆在它的真实历史地位上，作为帝国主义压榨下的殖民地半殖民地国家，和世界资本主义体系联系起来，即：中国过去曾经是资本主义国家进行原始积累的掠夺对象，后来又长期是各帝国主义国家的商品销售市场、原料供应地和投资的场所。在这里，特别避免了任何牵强附会的历史类比，也没有采取按照表现资本主义生产关系各个个别方面的某些经济范畴，如“货币”“资本”“工资”等，来孤立地进行联系。
    第三、加强思想领导，是保证理论学习正规进行的主要条件：夜大学在领导教学过程中，曾遇到各种各样的思想问题，如最初有的教师参加夜大学学习理论是因为“本钱”不够，为要用“新”的理论讲课，而来学习；也有的人在学习中有把理论学习与业务对立起来看的思想；有的教师只要学习与自己业务有关的理论部分，在自然科学教师中有的则要求单独学“自然辩证法”等……。由于我校党委与行政领导上加强了思想领导，不断进行教育，并配合工会组织生活经常进行批判，以上思想倾向得以逐渐纠正。
    目前，我校夜大学工作中仍存在不少问题和缺点，如教学计划性不够、辅导工作做得不够、解答问题和思想领导工作较差等等，都需要在今后工作中进一步求得改进。（原载八月十五日东北日报）
