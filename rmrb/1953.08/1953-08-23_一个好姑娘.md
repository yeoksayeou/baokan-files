    A Good Girl
    Ma Wei
    In early summer, the wheat in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, is ripe. On the terraced wheat fields of Wangqu Yuan along the Hao River in Chang'an County, farmers are busy harvesting. Among them is a young girl in her early twenties who, like the men, is cutting the wheat as fast as the wind, quickly clearing a large area. Many farmers are surprised by this girl's strenuous labor.

    This girl is Gao Shuqin, who is quite famous in this area. She is a member of the Communist Youth League and the fiancée of a volunteer soldier.

    Since she was a child, Gao Shuqin followed her father to the fields to drive carts to deliver manure, sow seeds, and harvest crops; she can do everything related to farm work. This year, her father is in poor health and cannot participate in heavy labor, so the entire summer harvest is being undertaken by her and her eighteen-year-old sister. In six days, they harvested six mu and six fen of wheat, more than six mu of broad beans, and three mu of peas. Loading the carts, stacking the sheaves, rolling the stacks, winnowing… they are also responsible for all of it. Shuqin's hard work is inseparable from the encouragement of her fiancé.

    In 1951, Shuqin's fiancé, Wang Zhenji, joined the volunteer army and went to Korea. Once, Zhenji's mother contracted "heart pain," couldn't eat well, couldn't sleep well, and had no strength to work. There was only Zhenji's father and two small children at home. Zhenji's father had to work in the fields every day, and the two children had to go to school, so there was a shortage of manpower to take care of things. Others told Shuqin's parents about this situation. Shuqin's father listened to this and looked at Shuqin, saying, "It's up to her!" However, Shuqin's mother said with certainty, "Go, you must go!"

    Shuqin lowered her head, blushing, and didn't speak. She thought, "I'm not married yet, how can I go!" Thinking this, she ran out by herself. After walking not far, she suddenly stopped, thinking, "Zhenji is a volunteer soldier, protecting our good life, and I am a member of the Communist Youth League, so I must go and see. Besides, his mother is sick and there is a shortage of manpower at home... If something bad happens to my mother-in-law and Zhenji hears about it, what am I going to say!" The more she thought about it, the more she felt something was wrong. Finally, she returned to the house and said to her parents, "Then... then I'll go!" When she spoke, a shy look was still on her face.

    The first time she went, she stayed for more than half a month. For the first two days, she felt uncomfortable and was shy when she saw people. As the days went by, everything felt the same as her own home, and she no longer felt restrained. She said to her mother-in-law, "Mom, tell me all the housework, I can do it all!" In the half month, in addition to serving her mother-in-law and cooking every day, Shuqin also took apart, washed, and mended all the cotton clothes in the family. The mother-in-law looked at her daughter-in-law, who was clever, skillful, and capable of doing everything, and liked her very much. When the mother-in-law's illness improved, Shuqin returned to her parents' home.

    After some time, the mother-in-law's illness relapsed. In addition, she saw that a child in the neighbor's family, who was a year younger than Zhenji, was getting married, and she thought of her own son's marriage, so the illness seemed more serious than last time.

    When Shuqin heard the news, she bought some gifts and went to her mother-in-law's house for the second time. She sat by her mother-in-law's side all day long, serving soup and medicine, and often comforted her, saying, "Mom, take it easy, we are not that old, what's the rush? It's not too late to get married after the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea is won! In the future, if anything happens to our family, just send a message and I'll come quickly."

    From then on, Shuqin went to her future mother-in-law's house whenever she had time. Each time she went, it was as if she had arrived at her own home. She put on an apron and did the housework neatly and cleanly before returning happily. Last year, during the wheat harvest, she also went to help her mother-in-law cook. The mother-in-law also treated Shuqin as her own daughter. When she did too much work, she would tell her to rest, fearing she would get sick from exhaustion. Whenever the family made something good to eat, she would always ask her daughter to cross the Hao River to call Shuqin over. After last year's wheat harvest, she also made Shuqin a set of calico uniform and bought her a pair of rubber shoes. Not long ago, the mother-in-law asked someone to write a letter to Zhenji, which said, "That girl from Gaojiawan often comes to our house. When Mom was sick several times, she came to take care of her, and she rushed to do all the housework. She is really diligent! She also studies very hard at home, and everyone likes her..." She also asked Shuqin to take a photo and sent it to Korea along with the letter.

    Before this year's wheat harvest, Shuqin received a letter from Korea. This was the first love letter she had ever received! The letter was full of passionate language, grateful words, and encouragement for Shuqin to continue her efforts and strive to be a model. In the letter, Zhenji also made his own promise: to strive to be a combat hero! When mentioning their own affairs, Zhenji said:

    "Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea is the responsibility of our young people. I am shouldering such a glorious and great task. When will the task be completed, when will we get married, our love is forever!"

    These words touched Shuqin's heart. Holding the letter in her hand, her heart was jumping with excitement. Finally, she bit her lip and said to herself, "I will definitely do as he says!" She immediately wrote a reply to Zhenji, accepting his challenge.

    Later, the news spread, and people said, "No wonder Shuqin was so energetic during the wheat harvest this year, she's really something!"

    一个好姑娘
    马葳
    初夏时节，陕西关中的麦子熟了。在长安县镐河河畔王曲塬上层层叠叠的麦浪中，农民们正在抢收。其中有一个二十上下的年轻姑娘，和男人一样，割得风也似地快，一会就割一大片。不少农民为这个姑娘的紧张劳动感到惊讶。
    这个姑娘就是在这一带相当出名的高淑琴，她是青年团员，又是一个志愿军战士的未婚妻。
    高淑琴从小就跟她爸下地赶车送粪，播种收割，庄稼活里样样都能来。今年她爸身体不好，不能参加重劳动，于是全部夏收就由她和她十八岁的妹妹担当起来。六天的功夫，她们就抢收了六亩六分麦子、六亩多扁豆，还有三亩豌豆。装车、打垛、放滚、扬场……，也全由她们包下来了。淑琴的紧张劳动，是和她的未婚夫的鼓励分不开的。
    那是一九五一年，淑琴的未婚夫王振济参加志愿军到朝鲜去了。一次，振济的妈得了“心口疼”病，吃不好，睡不好，活也没力气做。家里只有振济的爸爸和两个小孩子，振济的爸爸每天要到地里干活，两个孩子也要上学，家里缺少人手照顾。别人把这情形告诉了淑琴的爸妈，淑琴的爸听了这话，看了一下淑琴说：“看她自己吧！”可是，淑琴的妈说话很肯定：“去嘛，这可得去一趟呀！”
    淑琴在一旁低着头，红着脸，不说话。心想： “又没有过门，去了怎说呀！”想着，就一个人跑出去了。走了不远，她突然又停住脚，想：“振济人家当了志愿军，保卫着咱的好日子，自己又是个青年团员，说啥也得去看看。再说，人家妈有了病，家中缺人手，……万一婆婆有个好歹，传到振济的耳朵里，那我可该说什么呀！”她越想越不对头，最后还是回到屋里，对爸妈说：“那……那就去吧！”说话时，她脸上还流露着害羞的样子。
    她头一回去，一住就是半个多月。头两天，她老觉得不习惯，看到人还羞答答的。天数长了，一切都觉得和自己家里一模样儿，也不觉得拘束了。她对婆婆说：“妈，把家里的活儿都告诉我，我都可以做！”半个多月中，淑琴除了侍奉婆婆、每天做饭外，还把全家的棉衣都拆洗缝补了一遍。婆婆看着媳妇心又灵，手又巧，样样活做得来，喜欢得不得了。婆婆的病好了，淑琴才回了娘家。
    过了些时候婆婆的病又犯了，加上她看到邻家的一个孩子比振济还小一岁就结婚了，也想起了自己儿子的婚事，病显得比上次还重。
    淑琴听到这个消息，便买了一些礼物，第二次到婆婆家里去。她整天坐在婆婆跟前，侍汤奉药的，还常常安慰婆婆说：“妈，把心放宽点，我们年纪又不大，急啥哩？等抗美援朝胜利了，再结婚也不晚呀！以后咱家有啥事，只要捎个信，我很快就来。”
    从这以后，淑琴得空就到婆家去看看。每次去都和到了自家一样，围上围裙，把家里的活做个干净利落，然后才高高兴兴地回去。去年麦忙时，她还去帮助婆婆做饭。婆婆也把淑琴当做自己的亲闺女看待，做活多了就叫她休息休息，恐怕累病了。家里做点啥好吃的，总要叫自己的女儿过镐河去把淑琴叫来。去年麦收后，她还给淑琴做了一身洋布制服，买了一双胶鞋。不久前，婆婆托人给振济写了封信，信里说：“高家湾那个姑娘，常来咱家。妈病了几次，人家都跑来照顾，家里的啥活，她都抢着做。人真勤快！她在家里念书也顶努力，老少都喜欢她……。”她还叫淑琴拍了张照片，和信一块寄到了朝鲜。
    今年麦忙前，淑琴接到了一封从朝鲜寄来的信。这是她第一次接到的情书！信里充满着热情的语言，感激的字句，并勉励淑琴继续努力下去，争取当个模范。信里，振济也提出了自己的保证：争取做一个战斗英雄！提到他们自己的事时，振济说：
    “抗美援朝是咱们青年人的责任，我正担负着这样光荣伟大的任务，什么时候完成任务，什么时候再结婚吧，咱们的爱情是永远的！”
    这些话，句句都说到了淑琴的心上。她手里拿着信，心里激动得直跳。最后，她咬了咬嘴唇自言自语地说：“我一定照着做！”她马上给振济写了封回信，接受了他的挑战条件。
    后来，这个消息被传开了，人们都说：“怪不得今年收麦时，淑琴那个劲头呀，真大！”
