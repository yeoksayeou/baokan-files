Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, August 22nd (TASS): The Iranian King, who fled abroad after the failed first coup d'état launched by the Iranian palace clique on August 15th, returned to the Iranian capital, Tehran, on August 22nd.

The date and time of the King's arrival in Tehran were not announced in advance. It was only at the last minute, at 10:00 local time, that General Zahedi informed the diplomatic corps of the news while meeting with the ambassadors of various countries.

The authorities took emergency measures to protect the airport and the roads the King traveled. Two rows of soldiers were lined up along the ten-kilometer road from the airport to the capital, with one soldier every four meters. Tanks and armored vehicles guarded every intersection. Armored units and trucks filled with soldiers were lined up on the main streets of the capital to protect the roads the King traveled.

Newspapers such as the "Tehran Post" were published on the 22nd. "Handeniha Magazine" reported: "US Ambassador Henderson rushed back to Tehran the day after the King left Iran. Within hours of arriving in Tehran, he visited Mossadegh and formally declared to Mossadegh that the United States would do everything possible to prevent him from holding power in the future and suggested that he resign."

    逃往国外的伊朗国王已返国
    美国大使露骨地干涉伊朗内政
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰二十二日讯：在伊朗宫廷集团于十五日发动第一次政变失败后逃往外国的伊朗国王，已于二十二日回到伊朗首都德黑兰。
    国王抵达德黑兰的日期和时间事先都没有宣布。当地时间十时，萨希迪将军在接见各国大使时，才在最后时刻把这消息告诉各外交使团。
    当局采取了紧急措施，保护飞机场和国王行经的道路。沿着机场到首都十公里长的道路两旁，排列着两行士兵，每隔四公尺就有一个士兵。每一个十字路口都有坦克和装甲车把守。在首都大街上排列着装甲部队和装满了士兵的载重卡车，保护国王行经的道路。
    “德黑兰邮报”等报刊在二十二日都出版了。“汉德尼哈杂志”报道：“美国大使汉德逊在国王离开伊朗的第二天，立刻赶回德黑兰。他在到达德黑兰几小时以后，就访问了摩萨台，并向摩萨台正式声明，美国将竭尽一切力量阻挠他今后执政，同时建议他辞职。”
