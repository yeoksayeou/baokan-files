Xinhua News Agency, August 25th dispatch from New York: Hanson Baldwin, military reporter for the American "New York Times," published an article in the newspaper on August 2nd regarding the international situation after the Korean armistice, expressing pessimism about the various difficulties encountered by the United States in continuing its policy of aggression and war preparation.

Baldwin said that the Korean armistice, coupled with Soviet peaceful diplomacy and the easing of the sense of urgency in Europe, has meant that "most of the political and military policies of the United States over the past five years must be greatly revised." Baldwin admitted that the Korean armistice and the Soviet peace calls have made the trend of Western European capitalist countries relaxing their arms expansion and war preparations "almost irresistible." Baldwin believes that this situation is "not good," "because it is now almost certain that some of our (American) crucial policies are no longer effective, and these policies have always been the basis of our efforts in Western Europe." Baldwin bleakly admitted: "The fall of the Gasperi government, the entire trend of French politics, the Soviet peace offensive, and the events in East Germany have tolled the death knell for the European army. The results of the German (referring to West Germany) general election may even lead to Adenauer's defeat, or even if he continues to govern, his majority will be weakened, because for many German voters, the entire issue of a unified Germany has matured and is more pressing than the issue of West German rearmament and the organization of the European Defense Community. In other words, the entire face of Europe is changing, and the military policies we have supported in Europe seem to have failed."

Speaking of the situation in the Far East, Baldwin said that the Korean armistice has greatly affected the future of Japan. He said: "The demand that Japan will inevitably make to increase trade with Communist China has greatly increased in momentum and urgency, and the demand that American troops withdraw from Japan's major islands will also increase." Baldwin expressed unease over the fact that China has now become a powerful force preventing imperialist aggression and is currently engaged in large-scale economic construction, and admitted that the United States currently does not have a positive way to "adapt to the fact that a new and powerful force has emerged in the East." Baldwin described the US policy of intervening in the Vietnam War to date as a "patching up" approach. He expressed dissatisfaction with France's efforts in the colonial war in Vietnam.

Baldwin also expressed pessimism when discussing the situation in the Middle East and North Africa. He said that the United States had taken various measures in the Middle East to establish a "Middle East Defense Group" within the North Atlantic system, but the policies it pursued there "now seem to be all in vain." He pointed out that "nationalism and colonial unrest in Morocco, France's weakness, the repercussions caused by the situation in Indochina, and the difficulties encountered by the United States in building bases in North Africa" have made the United States lose confidence in establishing military bases in North Africa and pin its hopes on the fascist Franco, attempting to use Spain as a location for American air and naval bases. But he admitted that even if this plan is successfully negotiated, it is "out of step with the trend."

Finally, Baldwin admitted that after the Korean armistice, "the pressure at home in the United States to demand tax cuts, arms reduction, and cessation of large-scale overseas spending will increase," meaning that it will be more difficult to continue implementing the arms expansion and war preparation plan.

### “纽约时报”军事记者鲍德温承认  国际形势的变化使美国发动侵略更加困难

    “纽约时报”军事记者鲍德温承认
    国际形势的变化使美国发动侵略更加困难
    【新华社二十五日讯】纽约消息：美国“纽约时报”军事记者汉逊·鲍德温八月二日在该报上发表一篇关于朝鲜停战后国际形势的文章，对美国继续推行侵略备战政策所遭到的种种困难表示悲观。
    鲍德温说，朝鲜停战以及苏联的和平外交、欧洲对局势的紧急情绪的松弛等，使得“美国在过去五年中的政治和军事政策大部分都要大加修正”。鲍德温承认，朝鲜停战和苏联的和平号召已使得西欧资本主义国家放松扩军备战的趋势“几乎变得不可抗拒”。鲍德温认为这种情况是“不好的”，“因为，现在几乎已经确定的是：我们（美国）的一些具有关键性的政策已不再有效了，这些政策曾经一直是我们在西欧所作的努力的基础。”鲍德温黯然承认：“加斯贝利政府的垮台，法国政治的整个趋向、苏联的和平攻势和德国东区的事件，已替欧洲军敲了丧钟。德国（按指西德）大选的结果甚至可能使阿登纳遭到失败，或则他虽然继续执政，但他的多数地位将削弱，因为在许多德国选民心目中，统一德国的整个问题已经成熟，而且比西德的重新武装问题以及组织欧洲防务集团的问题更为迫切。换句话说，欧洲的整个面貌正在变化之中，而且我们在欧洲所曾经支持的军事政策似乎已经失败了。”
    谈到远东的局势时，鲍德温说，朝鲜停战已大大影响了日本的未来。他说：“日本必然要提出的增加对共产党中国贸易的要求，其声势和迫切性已大大增加，而日本要美军自日本各主要岛屿撤退的要求也一定会增加。”鲍德温对中国目前已经成为制止帝国主义侵略的一个强大力量和目前正在进行的大规模经济建设表示不安，并承认美国目前还没有一个积极的办法来“适应东方出现了一支新的、强大力量的事实”。鲍德温把美国迄今干预越南战争的政策，形容成是一种“补漏洞”的办法。他对于法国在越南殖民战争中的努力表示不满意。
    鲍德温谈到中东和北非的局势时，也同样地表现了悲观。他说，美国在中东曾经采取了各种办法，以便成立一个在北大西洋体系内的“中东防务集团”，但是它在那里推行的那些政策“现在似乎都是徒劳无益的”。他指出“摩洛哥境内的民族主义和殖民地骚动、法国的荏弱、印度支那局势所引起的反响和美国在北非建造基地所遭遇的困难”，使美国对于在北非建立军事基地失去信心，而把它的希望寄托在法西斯佛朗哥身上，企图把西班牙作为美国空军和海军基地的地点。但是他承认，这个计划即使谈得成功，也是“不合潮流了”。
    最后，鲍德温承认，在朝鲜停战后美国本国内“要求减税、削减军备与停止在海外大量化钱的压力将形增加”，就是说，要继续推行扩军备战计划将是更加困难了。
