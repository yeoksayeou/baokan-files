To Prepare for the Start of the Fall Semester This Year, the Central Higher Education Ministry Notifies Secondary Technical Schools of Postponed Opening
    The adjustment of various types of secondary technical schools nationwide will be initially completed this summer. Starting from the new fall semester of this year, some schools will begin teaching reforms. To ensure that schools are fully prepared for the fall semester and that this significant task is carried out with leadership and planning, achieving good results, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government has issued a notice deciding to postpone the opening date of all types of secondary technical schools from September 1st to September 15th. However, schools that can complete preparations ahead of schedule may open earlier as appropriate. The notice also provides opinions on the preparation work for the opening of school for reference by secondary technical schools in various regions:
    1. Make good ideological preparations, organize school leaders and teachers to study the documents of the National Higher Industrial Schools Administrative Conference, understand the experience of teaching reform in higher industrial schools, and the direction and tasks of future teaching reform work, as a reference for conducting teaching work in secondary technical schools. Persuasive educational work should also be carried out among students to steadily implement teaching reforms to avoid excessive or hasty demands.
    2. Make good teaching preparations: Relevant departments, based on the different situations of each school, should determine whether each school, each grade, or different classes will implement new teaching plans. They should guide and assist schools in formulating teaching plans for each grade and class that are suitable for different situations and requirements. For those that have decided to implement new professional teaching plans, teachers and assistant teaching staff should be organized to carefully study the teaching plans, teaching syllabi, and teaching reference books, specifically compile the class schedules for each class, and prepare semester lesson plans or lecture notes based on the teaching syllabi and teaching reference books. Before the start of school, each school must find ways to give teachers ample time to carry out the above work.
    3. Make good organizational preparations: School leaders should make good school-wide semester work plans, study and improve school administrative leadership, unify the pace of various school community activities under the strengthened leadership of the CCP committees in each school, and ensure the smooth progress of teaching work.
    4. Inspect the preparation work of various facilities and administrative affairs such as housing, canteens, teaching equipment, laboratories, practice factories, data rooms, and clinics.
    Schools that do not implement new professional teaching plans should also study their current teaching plans and make all preparations before the start of school to improve their work on the existing basis and prepare conditions for future teaching reforms.

    为作好今年秋季开学前的准备工作
    中央高等教育部通知中等技术学校延期开学
    全国各类中等技术学校的调整工作，将在今年暑期初步完成，从本年秋季新学年起，一部分学校将开始教学改革工作。为了使各校充分作好秋季开学前的准备工作，使这一重大任务能有领导有计划地进行，并收到良好的效果，中央人民政府高等教育部发出通知，决定将各类中等技术学校本年秋季开学日期由九月一日推迟至九月十五日，但准备工作能提前完成的，可以适当提前开学。通知并提出关于开学准备工作的意见，供各地中等技术学校参考：
    一、作好思想准备工作，组织学校负责人与教师学习全国高等工业学校行政会议的文件，领会高等工业学校教学改革的经验，及今后教学改革工作的方针与任务，作为中等技术学校进行教学工作的借镜，并应在学生中进行稳步贯彻教学改革以避免发生要求过高过急的说服教育工作。
    二、作好教学准备工作：各有关部门根据各学校的不同情况，确定各校各年级或不同班次是否执行新的教学计划，指导帮助各校制订适合于不同情况不同要求的各年级班次的教学计划。已确定执行新的专业教学计划的，应组织教师及助理教学人员很好地学习教学计划、教学大纲与教材参考书，具体编制各班的课程表，根据教学大纲与教学参考书编制学期授课计划或筹备讲义，各校在开学前务须设法给教师以较充裕的时间进行上项工作。
    三、作好组织准备工作：学校领导上应作好全校的学期工作计划，研究改进学校行政领导，在加强各校中共党委的领导下统一学校各社团活动步调，保证教学工作的顺利进行。
    四、检查房舍、食堂、教学用具、实验室、实习工厂、资料室、诊疗所等各项设备与行政事务的准备工作。
    在不执行新的专业教学计划的学校，也应就本校现行教学计划学习，作好开学前的一切准备工作，以求在现有基础上，把工作提高一步，准备将来进行教学改革的条件。
