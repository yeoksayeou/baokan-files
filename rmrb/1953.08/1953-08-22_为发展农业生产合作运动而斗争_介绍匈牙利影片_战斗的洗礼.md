    "Baptism of Fire" is one of the excellent films in the Hungarian Film Week currently being held in China. From this film, it can be seen that Hungarian film art, following the path of socialist realism, has achieved significant achievements in ideology and art.

    This film is based on the theme of depicting the struggle in developing the agricultural production cooperative cause. From the truthful depiction of this film, we more clearly recognize the correctness of the Hungarian Working People's Party's adherence to the policy of uniting with the middle peasants, and the importance of overcoming the over-leftist thinking of some cadres. Because the authors of the film have a deep understanding of the lives of Hungarian peasants and have grasped the interrelationships of various classes in the countryside and the ideological outlook of different characters, the film fully reflects the lives and struggles of Hungarian peasants. What is presented before us is a vivid picture. It gives us strong emotion and profound education.

    The film begins its story with Hato, a middle peasant who has been working independently for decades, joining an agricultural production cooperative. Hato is a respected person in the village. From his own personal experience and the Party's propaganda and education, he feels that joining the cooperative is better than working on his own. After Hato joined the cooperative, the Party's propaganda and education work in guiding peasants to participate in the agricultural production cooperative movement had more favorable conditions. Even Kapitan, a middle peasant with strong private ownership ideas, brought his two big horses into the cooperative. He said, "Work in the cooperative is done quickly. Even Hato has joined the cooperative, so it must be right for me to join too." Those who were hesitating and watching outside the cooperative also joined the "Double October" cooperative one after another. The "Double October" agricultural production cooperative therefore developed vigorously, forming a powerful force in the countryside. But its development was not smooth sailing. The film profoundly depicts the struggle of the "Double October" agricultural production cooperative against the rich peasant class in its development. It vividly portrays the ideological outlook of various classes of people in the countryside and the complex class relations, and fully depicts the leading role of the Party in the agricultural cooperative movement.

    In the film, Shao Haar, the representative of the rich peasant class, and the rich peasants gathered around her, are hostile to the agricultural production cooperative, hoping that the rule of the bourgeoisie will make a comeback so that they can continue to act as bullies and cruelly exploit the peasants. The rapid development of the agricultural production cooperative shattered their wishes. They said, "The cooperative is going to kill us!" Shao Haar, the wife of a rich peasant, is a very sinister and vicious person, and her hatred for the new life of the peasants is also the deepest. Some rich peasants came to her and asked her for ideas: "You are a clever person, you quickly think of a way!" "In two days we will have no place to hire labor." Shao Haar said, "I don't think you need to be afraid. As long as I use my brains, watch, I guarantee that the cooperative's propagandists will run in vain." She used the fact that Hato and Bo Jigne (Party branch secretary of the "Double October" agricultural production cooperative) had been in love when they were young to slander Bo Jigne in front of everyone; and she used the fact that Hato had bought a threshing machine and a mill with her to provoke the relationship between the cooperative and Hato, trying to pull the middle peasants out of the cooperative and destroy the cooperative; she herself would then organize a "cooperative" centered on the rich peasants and representing the interests of the rich peasants, thereby restoring the rule of the rich peasant class in the village.

    Her conspiracy temporarily worked, because the "leftist" sickness of Klem, the chairman of the "Double October" agricultural production cooperative, gave the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of. After Klem drove the middle peasant Hato out of the cooperative, many middle peasants were provoked by the enemy and followed Hato to demand withdrawal from the cooperative. This intense struggle scene in the film and the portrayal of Shao Haar's character are very vivid. The film not only depicts how she and the reactionary rich peasants carried out sabotage activities, but also depicts her collusion with the counter-revolutionary element Misha. Misha is Hato's brother-in-law, who had killed many revolutionaries. After the liberation of Hungary, he pretended to be stupid and hid in Shao Haar's house, as Shao Haar's lover, wanting to wait for an opportunity to counterattack the people. Shao Haar once used Misha to threaten Hato, asking Hato to participate in the "cooperative" she organized. Hato refused and wanted to report Misha. Shao Haar let Misha shoot Hato, but Misha's bullet hit Bo Jigne in the chest. In this tense dramatic conflict, the film not only truthfully shows the sinister and vicious methods of Shao Haar and Misha; but also, through the depiction of Shao Haar and Misha's cohabitation relationship, vividly shows the morally degenerate face of the reactionary class.

    The film successfully created the image of Bo Jigne, an excellent leader of the Party. Bo Jigne is the Party branch secretary of the "Double October" agricultural production cooperative. She deeply understands the importance of the Party's policy of uniting with the middle peasants and has made a firm struggle to realize this policy. The Bo Jigne depicted in the film is not a dry, bloodless person. She is a real person with the temperament of a new person, profound thoughts, and rich emotions. She was once moved by Shao Haar's slander, but she did not weaken because of this. When she saw those peasants who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative hitting the cooperative's stable with big sticks, and the cooperative was facing danger, she unhesitatingly used her body to block the door of the stable. After she was injured by a counter-revolutionary element, she still worried about the work of the cooperative and convened a meeting of the Party branch committee while lying in bed. With the spirit of the Party's principles, she strictly criticized the leftist naiveté of Klem, the chairman of the cooperative, and pointed out his mistake of regarding the middle peasants as enemies. She said that the Party's task is to unite the peasants around itself, to educate and transform them, and to guide them to the road of collectivization. She pointed out that the attitude of hostility towards the middle peasants like Klem's would only benefit the enemy and make Shao Haar and Misha happy. The film also depicts Bo Jigne bringing Hato to her, and also criticizing and educating Hato's wavering. She said: "In the old society, what you cared about was how to buy more land for yourself. No matter how hard it was, as long as you could buy land, it was fine. Now it's different from the past, the times have changed. You joined the cooperative, but you always thought that putting the horses and land into the cooperative was enough. As for the ideology, you can leave it outside and ignore it." Hato admitted his mistake and was deeply moved by Bo Jigne's strong spirit. Under Bo Jigne's correct leadership, Hato and some of the middle peasants who had withdrawn from the cooperative returned to the cooperative again. After a serious struggle, the cooperative developed vigorously again.

    The film fully demonstrates the Party's leading role in the countryside through Bo Jigne's struggle against Klem's mistakes and her education of Hato. Klem is a veteran Party member who is loyal to the Party's cause. He has shed blood for the revolution. He personally started the "Double October" agricultural production cooperative. He believes that the cooperative has what it has today because "I shed blood to get it," and it is the price that the old members have paid for more than two years of hard work. The new members are enjoying the fruits of their labor; therefore, he is jealous and repels those new members, driving them out of the cooperative and closing the door of the cooperative tightly. But he does not understand that the Party's cause is to struggle for the interests of hundreds of millions of people. Those peasants who did not join the cooperative very early need the Party to give them patient education, to guide those peasants who are accustomed to individual labor to overcome conservative, backward, selfish, and self-interested ideas, and to move towards the road of organization. When those peasants have become aware and ask to join the cooperative, they should be welcomed, not treated in the opposite way. Klem does not understand these things. He cannot see the new changes in the thinking of those peasants. He carries the burden of a meritorious minister and causes losses to the Party's cause.

    At the same time, the film also focuses on criticizing the wavering of the middle peasant class and their selfish and self-interested ideas. Hato once tried hard to climb to the position of a rich peasant, but he did not achieve this wish. He had a subtle relationship with the rich peasant Shao Haar. They bought a threshing machine and a mill together. However, the development of the revolutionary reality has changed the road that Hato wanted to take, a road that could not be taken. The new life pointed out a new road to him—joining the agricultural production cooperative, but he could not immediately join in. He hesitated and watched for a long time before finally deciding to join the cooperative. On the screen, we also see the peasants Kapitan and Fu Waluoshi who have just joined the cooperative. What they care about most is not the affairs of the cooperative, but their own vineyards and horses. When the cooperative's land should be sown, the two of them hide at home and do their own things. When the cooperative held a celebration meeting, Fu Waluoshi secretly grabbed a handful of sugar and gave it to his two horses to eat. These specific and detailed descriptions hit the peasants' selfish problems sharply. But this does not mean that because the peasants have these problems, they can be abandoned and ignored. On the contrary, it further illustrates the importance of conducting long-term and patient ideological education for the peasants. (Picture attached)

    为发展农业生产合作运动而斗争
    ——介绍匈牙利影片“战斗的洗礼”

    编剧：乌尔本  导演：巴恩    翻译：胡伯胤、李玉华匈牙利电影制片公司出品  中央电影局东北电影制片厂译制
    “战斗的洗礼”是这次在中国举行的匈牙利电影周中优秀的影片之一。从这部影片可以看出，匈牙利的电影艺术，遵循着社会主义现实主义的创作道路，在思想上、艺术上已经获得了显著的成就。
    这部影片是以描写发展农业生产合作事业中的斗争为题材的。从这部影片的真实描写中，我们更清楚地认识到匈牙利劳动人民党坚持团结中农路线的正确性，和克服某些干部过左思想的重要。由于影片的作者们，对匈牙利农民生活的深入理解，掌握了农村中各个阶级的相互关系和不同人物的思想面貌，影片便充分地反映了匈牙利农民的生活和斗争。呈现在我们眼前的，是一幅生动的图景。它给我们以强烈的感动和深刻的教育。
    影片是以单干了数十年的中农哈托参加农业生产合作社开始它的故事的。哈托是个在村子里有威望的人，由他自己切身的体验和党的宣传教育，他感到参加合作社比自己单干好。哈托入社后，党在引导农民参加农业生产合作运动方面的宣传教育工作更有了有利条件，连私有观念很浓的中农卡皮丹也把他的两匹大马牵进了合作社。他说：“合作社里干活干的快，连哈托都入合作社了，我入社也一定错不了。”那些在合作社门外徘徊观望的人们，也都纷纷加入到“双十月”合作社里来。“双十月”农业生产合作社因此蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来，在农村中形成了一股强大的力量。但它的发展并不是一帆风顺的。影片深刻地描写了“双十月”农业生产合作社在发展中，与富农阶级所作的斗争。它生动地把农村中各阶级人物的思想面貌和错综复杂的阶级关系表现了出来，并把党在农业合作运动中的领导作用，作了充分的描写。
    影片中，富农阶级的代表人物邵哈尔，以及聚集在她周围的富农们，敌视农业生产合作社，希望资产阶级的统治卷土重来，以便他们继续作威作福，对农民进行残酷剥削。农业生产合作社的迅速发展，使他们的愿望破产了。他们说：“合作社是要咱们的命哪！”富农的妻子邵哈尔，是个非常阴险毒辣的人，她对于农民新生活的仇视也是最深的。一些富农们找到她，要她出主意：“你是一个聪明人，你赶快想个办法吧！”“再过两天咱们就没有地方雇工去了。”邵哈尔说：“我看你们用不着害怕，只要我动动脑筋，瞧着吧，保管叫合作社那些宣传员白跑腿就是了。”她利用哈托和波吉涅（“双十月”农业生产合作社党支部书记）在年轻时曾经恋爱过的事，在众人面前中伤波吉涅；又利用哈托曾和她一起买过脱谷机和磨坊的事，挑拨合作社和哈托的关系，企图把中农从合作社里拉出来，搞垮合作社；她自己再来组织以富农为中心、代表富农利益的“合作社”，从而在村子里恢复富农阶级的统治。
    她的阴谋暂时发生了作用，这是因为“双十月”农业生产合作社的主席克列姆的“左”倾病，给敌人以可乘之机。克列姆把中农哈托赶出合作社后，许多中农受了敌人的挑拨，也跟着哈托相继要求出社。影片中的这一激烈的斗争场景，和对邵哈尔这个人物的刻划，是很生动的。影片不但描写了她和反动的富农们怎样进行破坏活动，而且也描写了她和反革命分子米沙的勾结。米沙是哈托的内弟，曾杀过许多革命人士。匈牙利解放后，他装傻藏在邵哈尔家里，作邵哈尔的姘夫，想待机向人民反扑。邵哈尔曾用米沙威胁哈托，让哈托参加她组织的“合作社”。哈托拒绝了，并要检举米沙。邵哈尔让米沙去打死哈托，但米沙的子弹却射中波吉涅的胸膛。影片在这一紧张的戏剧冲突中，不但真实地表现了邵哈尔和米沙的阴险毒辣的手段；而且，通过邵哈尔和米沙姘居关系的描写，把反动阶级的道德堕落的面貌，也生动地表现了出来。
    影片成功地创造了党的优秀的领导者波吉涅的形象。波吉涅是“双十月”农业生产合作社的党支部书记，她深刻地体会了党的团结中农路线的重要，并为实现这一路线作了坚决的斗争。影片所描写的波吉涅，不是干瘪的没有血肉的人。她是具有新人的气质，思想深刻、情感丰富的真实人物。她曾为邵哈尔的中伤激动过，但她并没有因此就软弱下来。当她看到那些要退社的农民用大棍子撞合作社的马房，合作社面临着危险时，她毫不迟疑地用身体去挡住马房的大门。她被反革命分子打伤后，仍惦记着合作社的工作，躺在床上，召开了党支部委员会。她以党的原则精神，严格地批判了合作社主席克列姆的左倾幼稚病，指出了他把中农看成敌人的错误。她说党的任务是把农民团结在自己周围，去教育改造他们，引导他们走向集体化的道路。她指出像克列姆那种敌视中农的态度，就只有对敌人有利，使邵哈尔和米沙等高兴。影片并描写了波吉涅将哈托找来，对哈托的动摇，也进行了批评教育。她说：“在旧社会你关心的就是自己怎样多买地，再苦，只要能买地就行。如今跟从前不同了，时代变了。你参加到合作社里来，可是你总以为把马和土地入社就行了。至于思想，可以放在外面不理它。”哈托承认了错误，深受到波吉涅的坚强精神的感动。在波吉涅的正确领导下，哈托和一些退社的中农们重新回到合作社里来。合作社经过一场严重的斗争后，又蓬勃地向前发展了。
    影片通过波吉涅对克列姆错误的斗争，以及对哈托的教育，把党在农村的领导作用充分地表现了出来。克列姆是一个忠实于党的事业的老党员，他为革命流过血，他亲手把“双十月”农业生产合作社搞起来；他认为合作社所以有今天，“是我流血换来的”，是老社员辛辛苦苦干了两年多的代价，新社员入社是坐享其成；所以他嫉忌、排斥那些新社员，把他们从合作社里赶出去，把合作社的大门关得紧紧的。但他不了解党的事业就是为了千百万群众的利益而斗争的。那些没有很早就参加合作社的农民们，需要党对他们加以耐心的教育，去引导那些过惯了个体劳动生活的农民，克服保守、落后、自私自利的思想，走向组织起来的道路。当那些农民已经有了觉悟，要求加入合作社时，就应该欢迎他们，而不应采取相反的态度。克列姆不了解这些，他看不见那些农民在思想上的新变化，背着功臣包袱，给党的事业造成了损失。
    同时，影片也着重地批判了中农阶层的动摇，和他们的自私自利的思想。哈托曾努力想爬到富农的地位上去，但他没有达到这种愿望。他和富农邵哈尔有过微妙的关系，他们一起买过脱谷机和磨坊。但是，革命现实的发展，转变了哈托要走的那一条走不通的道路。新的生活向他指出了新的道路——参加农业生产合作社，但他并不能马上就参加进来，他曾经长时期的犹豫观望，最后才决定加入合作社。我们在银幕上，还看到刚加入合作社的农民卡皮丹与福瓦洛诗。他们最关心的不是合作社的事情，而是他们自己的葡萄园和马匹。合作社的土地该播种了，他们两个却躲在家里干自己的事，福瓦洛诗在合作社开庆祝大会时，偷偷地抓了一把糖，送给他的两匹马吃。这些具体的细致的描写，一针见血地刺中了农民的自私毛病。但这并不是说，由于农民有了这些毛病，就可以扔掉他们不管，相反地，它更说明了对农民必须进行长期的耐心的思想教育的重要性。（附图片）
    波吉涅被反革命分子打伤后，她躺在床上，召开了“双十月”农业生产合作社的党支委会，批评了克列姆的左倾思想，哈托又重新回到合作社。
    中农哈托（左起第一人），认识到农业生产合作社集体劳动的优越性，他自动要求入社。
