The Work of Communist Party Members in the Dike Construction Team of the Twenty-First Engineering Company
By our reporter, Pei Lan

In the first quarter of 1953, the task was to complete 8,800 cubic meters of concrete work. For the dike construction team, this was a rather arduous task. However, the Party branch and all Party members of this construction team were determined and confident to complete this task.

Working in the Ice River

In January, the earth was tightly sealed by wind and snow, and the dike construction team had to start preparing for the drilling and rebar insertion project at this time. The drilling workers of the dike construction team used large pneumatic drills to drill holes in the frozen, hard ground. The bitter northwest wind froze their hands red and even numb. But this did not make the drilling workers flinch. Their hearts were inspired by the brilliant prospects of the industrialization of the motherland. Everyone had the confidence to complete this arduous and glorious task.

Working in this severe cold season, there were indeed many difficulties. When the drilling workers were finally required to work in the ice river, some people began to waver. Tian Junfa, the leader of the drilling construction team and a Communist Party member, thought: This is the time to test every Communist Party member. Communist Party members must lead everyone to overcome this difficulty. But how to lead everyone to overcome this difficulty? Tian Junfa thought that the only way was for Communist Party members to take the lead in going down to the ice river to work. This Communist Party member, who was very thin but had a very strong will, put on his work clothes and firmly jumped into the ice river at minus 30 degrees Celsius. As soon as he put his hands into the ice river, it felt like thousands of small needles were pricking his fingertips, causing excruciating pain. Tian Junfa did not show any fear of this. On the contrary, he became more determined and more aware of the importance of his task. Tian Junfa worked harder, sweating profusely, and his hands regained sensation. At that time, someone asked him: Is it cold? Tian Junfa replied: Of course, it's cold. But his heart of love for the construction of the motherland, the heart of a Communist Party member, finally overcame the severe cold of the ice river.

Everyone intently watched Tian Junfa's work, and everyone was very concerned about Tian Junfa's thin body. Seeing that Tian Junfa had been working in the ice river for a long time, everyone asked him to come up and warm up. However, Tian Junfa still insisted on working and refused to come up. This made everyone even more uneasy and excited. Sun Rongchang, the branch secretary, lied to him, saying, "Old Tian, the branch is calling for you." After Tian Junfa came up, Sun Rongchang pressed him down by the fire and poured him a cup of wine to warm him up. At this time, Tian Junfa smiled knowingly and jumped back into the ice river to continue working. Gao Wanhong, Zhang Fengshan, and He Rongjiang, who were working with Tian Junfa in the ice river, were also moved and said: The team leader (referring to Tian Junfa) is in such poor health and can still work like this, let alone us young lads. An old worker said:
"He truly deserves to be a Communist Party member." Under the leadership of Tian Junfa, the efficiency of drilling in the water gradually increased, from 3.5 meters per shift to more than 4 meters....

When the drilling project was about to end, another difficulty was encountered: because the construction site was reduced, the frame of the pneumatic drill could not be placed, and there was no way to continue working. Jin Yushan, who had applied to join the Party, said that he would find a way to overcome this difficulty and strive to join the Party in completing this project. He tried all the drilling machines, tank drilling machines, rotary drilling machines, large pneumatic drills... none of them could be placed. What to do? He thought: We are not afraid of heavy winds and heavy snow, how can we let these little difficulties stop our work and affect the progress of the entire project? Jin Yushan finally came up with a method to remove the frame of the large pneumatic drill and hold the large pneumatic drill by hand to work. At that time, some workers said it would work, and some workers said it would not work, because holding the machine by hand to drill, the vibration of the drill was very large, and there was no accuracy. However, without this method, there was no better way to do it in this situation. Jin Yushan had very good drilling skills, and he was determined to try it. During the experiment, Jin Yushan concentrated all his energy on the pneumatic drill in his hands. At this time, he thought of the prospects for the construction of the motherland; he thought of the fighting spirit of the volunteers in Korea; he thought of his own great and glorious ideals, and he worked with special energy. Jin Yushan finally mastered the law of machine vibration and ensured that the drilling quality met the specifications. After the experiment was successful, Jin Yushan personally demonstrated it to everyone so that everyone could learn. The entire team adopted this method and completed the project task on schedule. Jin Yushan, because he met the conditions for party membership in other aspects, plus his performance in overcoming difficulties this time, was approved to become a member of the Communist Party of China.

Racing Against Time

After the completion of the preparatory work for drilling and rebar insertion, the concrete work began. Everyone adopted the advanced Soviet experience and adopted a segmented parallel flow operation method. Soviet experts also put forward a valuable suggestion. In order to ensure the quality of the project, it was required to complete one segment number at a time. But everyone had never seen this method before, let alone done it this way. Therefore, some people said: "In the past, we could only pour up to three meters high at a time, but now we are pouring eight meters high at once, and we are not sure." Others said: "It's useless if the cement doesn't arrive." After the branch understood these ideological situations, it immediately convened a meeting of Party members and Youth League members to explain to everyone in detail that the Soviet experts' suggestion was based on scientific evidence and must be implemented 100%. The administration and the trade union also separately convened forums for cadres above the field, section, and team leaders, as well as technicians, and a general meeting of all workers, mobilizing everyone to resolutely overcome difficulties and implement the Soviet experts' suggestions. After these mobilizations, the confidence of Communist Party members, Youth League members, and non-Party activists was enhanced, and they expressed their willingness to respond to the Party's call with practical actions. At this time, those workers who held skeptical attitudes also said: Let's give it a try. The result of the experiment was that one segment number was completed in fifty-one hours. Soviet experts suggested again: To complete the task on schedule, one segment number must be completed within twenty-five hours. The administrative and Party leading cadres of the dike construction team also saw this. According to the current progress, it was very difficult to complete the 8,800 cubic meters of concrete project on schedule, and it was necessary to improve efficiency and speed up the work.

"Strive to complete one segment number in twenty-five hours" is the key issue at present. To solve this problem, there must be organic cooperation between the mixing plant, the vehicle dispatching team, the crane yard, the carpentry team, and the vacuum team. Otherwise, it would be difficult to solve this problem. Now, not only did some workers and technicians lack confidence, but even the site director and the administrative leading cadres of the team lacked confidence. The workers said that there was no way to shorten it to twenty-five hours, and the administration and the trade union called on the workers: Strive to complete one segment number in thirty hours. Lu Shihhan, the secretary of the Party branch, immediately convened a branch committee to study the thinking of the leading cadres and clearly pointed out that to implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, the leading cadres must first have confidence and determination. After the meeting, the branch committee members helped the team's leading cadres and the site director analyze the causes of the difficulties and find ways to overcome them in order to enhance their confidence. The branch also proposed that the leading cadres should establish a clear view of relying on the working class and hand over the national engineering plan to the workers for discussion so that the national engineering plan would become the workers' own work plan. Within the Party, it was further clarified that implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts was the Party's political task for the dike construction team, and every Party member must strictly implement it.

The branch's call received a good response, and the entire construction site was boiling. Yang Bolin, the leader of the vehicle dispatching team and the Party group leader, and all the workers in the team tried to find ways to improve work efficiency. At that time, the vehicle dispatching team had a total of six locomotives, which could send a maximum of eight cans of cement per hour, but according to the requirement of completing one segment number in twenty-five hours, it was necessary to increase it to twelve cans. After Yang Bolin and everyone studied it, they first proposed to speed up the vehicle speed on the bridge. Yang Bolin made this suggestion to the team. In order to ensure safe driving, Chen Guishan, the deputy secretary of the branch, and the captain of the security team both went to the vehicle dispatching team to help solve this problem. Yang Bolin personally drove the locomotive for testing, starting with two gears, then three gears, and finally four gears, and the vehicle was safe. After the problem of vehicle speed on the bridge was solved, Yang Bolin discussed with Communist Party member Tian Yongji to change the one-way line of the vehicle road to a circular line, which could solve the problem of car accumulation and idling. Communist Party member and Youth League branch secretary Wang Lingkun also led the entire group of workers to put forward the slogan that vehicle travel should be equidistant and balanced, and no one should grab cars, further overcoming the phenomenon of grabbing cars and car accumulation, and strengthening labor discipline. After these efforts, Wang Lingkun's locomotive reached seventeen cans the next day. The two locomotives of Youth League members Li Jinglin and Wu Xishan also reached seventeen cans, and other locomotives also reached sixteen cans. At this time, labor competitions were launched between teams (referring to small teams) and between locomotives in the vehicle dispatching team. The locomotives were filled with challenge letters, and big red slogans shone on the heads of the locomotives. Everyone's heart was like ten thousand red flowers blooming, and everyone was working hard to create higher records. As a result, a record of nineteen cans per vehicle was finally created.

The vehicle dispatching team also launched a competition with the crane yard, and Wang Fengqi, the director of the crane yard and a Communist Party member, led all the workers to put forward the challenge conditions: Guarantee to hoist as many cans as are sent, and never fall behind. The mixing plant also put forward the challenge conditions: The vehicle dispatching team sends quickly, and we must load quickly. In the past, it took five minutes to load one can, but now we must strive to load one can in three minutes.

People Can Overcome All Difficulties

All the teams were moving, but the model group of the carpentry team had not yet moved, which directly affected the progress of the entire project. Lu Shihhan, the secretary of the branch, immediately went to the site to understand the situation. The carpentry team had also enthusiastically discussed the Party's call, but one difficulty could not be solved for a while, that is, the model could not be installed in advance. Because if the model is installed in advance, it is easy to be damaged by the vibrator, and after the model is erected, the lowest layer of concrete is not easy to solidify, and the quality cannot be guaranteed. Lu Shihhan helped the carpentry team continue to solve this problem on the one hand, and suggested that Liu Fu (Communist Party member), the leader of the pouring team, and the workers work together to find a solution on the other hand.

The Communist Party members and Youth League members of the pouring team launched a heated discussion. Ding Yangzhong, a new party member, proposed a method of installing the model in advance and then drilling into the rebar mesh to pour concrete.

The method was proposed, but there were still many difficulties. Looking at the high model boxes and the dense rebar mesh, everyone felt that it was like squatting in an iron cage after squeezing in sideways, and they could not move freely. But now, not only must they drill in, but they must also hold the vibrator to work, and not only must they work, but they must also ensure that the project quality fully meets the specifications. Ding Yangzhong looked at the rebar mesh for a long time and decided on his own working method: drill the hole with the upper body, put the vibrator there, and stretch the hand out of the hole to hold the vibrator... He observed it carefully and drilled in, and did not come out until it was vibrated well. After he came out, his upper body was completely covered in mud. Someone laughed at him and asked him to take a picture in the puddle. Ding Yangzhong smiled and said: You see I am not good-looking, but the concrete that is poured is smooth and beautiful! If I am good-looking, the concrete that is poured will be ugly. Communist Party members Li Gui and Sun Rong, Youth League members Wang Haichun and Liu Yulin all followed suit and drilled into the rebar mesh to work, and even the old group leader Wang Lian worked in this way.

Through the efforts of all parties, one segment number has been completed in twenty-seven hours. At this time, the branch further proposed: Add another effort to ensure that one segment number is completed in twenty-five hours. In the end, not only was twenty-five hours achieved, but it only took nineteen hours to complete one segment number.

The task of 8,800 cubic meters of concrete was finally completed ahead of schedule.

    二十一工程公司筑堤工程队共产党员的工作
    本报记者  培蓝
    在一九五三年第一季度里，就要完成八千八百立方公尺的混凝土工程。这对筑堤工程队来说，不能不是一个相当艰巨的任务。但是，这个工程队的党支部和全体党员有决心和信心来完成这一任务。
    工作在冰河里
    一月，大地被风雪严密地封锁着，筑堤工程队就要在这个时候开始准备钻孔插筋工程。筑堤工程队的钻孔工人拿着大风钻在冰冻的坚硬的地面上钻孔。凛冽的西北风把他们的双手冻得通红，甚至麻木了。但这并没有使钻孔工人们畏缩，他们的心被光辉灿烂的祖国工业化的前途所鼓舞着，大家有信心来完成这个艰巨而又光荣的任务。
    在这个严寒的季节里工作，困难的确是很多的。当最后要求钻孔工人在冰河里工作时，有些人就动摇起来。钻孔施工班班长，共产党员田俊发想：这正是考验每个共产党员的时候，共产党员就要带动大家克服这个困难。但是怎么样带动大家克服这个困难呢？田俊发想，唯一的办法，就是共产党员带头下到冰河里去工作。这个身体很瘦弱，但是意志十分坚强的共产党员，穿了工作服，坚定地跳进了摄氏零下三十度的冰河里，两手一伸进冰河，就像千万根小针在扎着指尖一样，疼彻心骨。田俊发对这些并没有表示畏缩，相反的，他更加坚定，更加了解自己任务的重大。田俊发加劲工作，干得满头是汗，两手就恢复了知觉。当时有人问他：冷不冷呢？田俊发回答说：当然冷啊。但是他的热爱祖国建设的心，共产党员的心，终于战胜了严寒的冰河。
    每一个人都聚精会神地注视着田俊发的工作，每一个人又都十分关心着田俊发的瘦弱的身体。大家看到田俊发已在冰河里工作了很长时间，就要他上来暖暖身体。但是，田俊发仍然坚持工作，不肯上来。这更使大家不安和激动了。支部干事孙荣昌就对他撒了一个谎，说：“老田，支部叫你去。”等田俊发起来后，孙荣昌一把把他按在火边，又给他倒了一盅酒，要他暖暖身体。这时，田俊发会意地笑了笑，又跳进冰河里去继续工作。正在冰河里和田俊发一起工作的高万红、张凤山和何荣江也感动地说：班长（指田俊发）身体这么不好还能这样工作，何况我们这伙年青小伙子。老工人说：
    “真不愧是个共产党员。”在田俊发的带头下，水里钻孔的效率逐渐提高，每班由三公尺五提高到四公尺多……。
    在钻孔工程将要结束时，又遇到了一个困难：因为工地地盘缩小，放不下风钻的架子，没法继续工作了。已经申请入党的金玉山表示要设法克服这个困难，并要在完成这个工程中争取入党。他把所有的钻机都试过了，坦克钻孔机、旋回钻孔机、大风钻……都放不下。怎么办呢？他想：大风大雪我们都不怕，难道还能让这点点困难阻止我们的工作，影响整个工程进度吗？金玉山终于想出把大风钻的机架卸下来，用手托着大风钻工作的办法。当时有些工人说行，也有些工人说不行，因为用手托着机器钻，钻机震动力很大，没有准。但是，不用这个办法，在这种情况下又没有别的更好的办法。金玉山钻孔技术很好，他决心要试验一下。在试验的时候，金玉山集中全副精力注视着两只手中的风钻。这时他想起了祖国建设的远景；想起了志愿军在朝鲜的战斗精神；想起了自己伟大的光荣的理想，干起来特别有劲。金玉山终于掌握了机器震动的规律，保证了钻孔质量合乎规格。试验成功后，金玉山又亲自表演给大家看，让大家学习。全队采用这个办法，按期完成了工程任务。金玉山由于其他方面都合乎党员的条件，加上这次克服困难的表现，就被批准为中国共产党党员。
    和时间赛跑
    钻孔插筋的准备工程竣工之后，就开始了打混凝土工程。大家根据苏联的先进经验，采用分段平行流水作业法。苏联专家还提出了一个宝贵的建议，为了保证工程质量，要求一次打完一个分段号。但这种作法大家从来没有见过，更没有这样作过。因此有人说：“过去一次最多打三公尺高，现在一下打八公尺高，没有把握。”又有人说：“洋灰来不了，也是白说。”支部了解了这些思想情况后，立即召开了党、团员大会，详细向大家讲解苏联专家建议是有科学根据的，必须百分之百地执行。行政和工会也分别召开了场、股、组长以上干部和技术人员座谈会、全体工人大会，动员大家坚决克服困难，贯彻苏联专家的建议。经过这些动员后，共产党员、青年团员和非党积极分子的信心增强了，表示要以实际行动来回答党的号召。这时那些持怀疑态度的工人也说：试试看吧。试验的结果，五十一小时打完了一个分段号。苏联专家又建议：要按期完成任务，必须在二十五小时内打完一个分段号。筑堤工程队的行政和党的领导干部也看到了这一点，按照目前进度看，是很难按期完成八千八百立方公尺混凝土的工程任务的，必须提高效率，加紧赶工。
    “争取二十五小时打完一个分段号”，这是当前的关键问题。要解决这个问题，就必须有混合机场、配车班、起重机场、木工班和真空班的有机的配合。否则就很难解决这个问题。现在不仅部分工人和技术人员没有信心，就是工地主任和队里的行政领导干部也没有信心了。工人们表示没有办法缩短到二十五小时，行政和工会就向工人号召：争取在三十小时打完一个分段号。党支部书记卢世汉立即召开支部委员会，研究了领导干部的思想，明确提出：要贯彻苏联专家的建议，首先要领导干部有信心有决心。会后，支部委员分别帮助队里的领导干部、工地主任分析困难的原因，找寻克服困难的办法，以增强他们的信心。支部并且提出领导干部要树立明确的依靠工人阶级的观点，把国家的工程计划交给工人讨论，使国家的工程计划变成工人自己的工作计划。在党内又进一步明确提出：贯彻苏联专家建议是筑堤工程队的党的政治任务，每个党员必须严格执行。
    支部的号召得到了良好的反应，整个工地沸腾起来了。配车班班长、党的小组长杨柏林就和全班工人一起想办法找窍门，提高工作效率。当时配车班共有六台机车，每小时最多能送八罐洋灰，但是按照二十五小时打一个分段号的要求，就要增加到十二罐。杨柏林和大家研究以后，首先提出要加速桥上车行速度。杨柏林向队里提出了这个建议。为了保证安全行车，支部副书记陈贵山和保安队队长都亲自深入到配车班，帮助解决这个问题。杨柏林亲自开机车作试验，开始开二闸，后来开三闸，最后开四闸，车行安全。桥上车行速度问题解决了，杨柏林又和共产党员田永吉商量，将车路的单行线改为巡回线，这样可以解决堆车窝工的问题。共产党员、青年团支部书记王凌坤又领导全组工人提出了车行要等距平衡，不准抢车的口号，进一步克服了抢车、堆车的现象，并加强了劳动纪律。经过这些工作，第二天王凌坤的机车就达到十七罐。团员李景林、吴喜山的两台机车也都达到了十七罐，其他机车也达到了十六罐。这时配车班的班与班（指小班）、机车与机车展开了劳动竞赛。机车上贴满了挑战应战书，大红标语在机车头上闪闪发光，大家心里就像开放了万朵红花，每个人争先恐后地工作着，创造更高的纪录。结果一台车送十九罐的最高纪录终于创造出来了。
    配车班又向起重机场提出了竞赛，起重机场场长、共产党员王凤岐领导全体工人提出了应战条件：保证送多少罐吊多少罐，决不落后。混合机场也提出了应战的条件：配车班送得快，我们就要装的快，过去五分钟装一罐，现在要争取三分钟装一罐。
    人能够克服一切困难
    各班都动起来了，但是木工班的模型组还没有动起来，这就直接影响了整个工程的进行。支部书记卢世汉立即深入现场了解情况。木工班也曾热烈地讨论了党的号召，但是有一个困难一时不能解决，就是模型不能预先安装。因为预先安装模型，一则容易被震动器震坏，二则模型立好后，最下层的混凝土就不容易打固，不能保证质量。卢世汉一面帮助木工班继续解决这个问题；一面建议浇制班班长刘福（共产党员）和工人们一起想办法解决这个问题。
    浇制班的共产党员、青年团员展开了热烈的讨论。新党员丁阳忠提出了预先安装模型，然后钻进铁筋网里去打混凝土的办法。
    办法提出来了，但是困难还是很多的。大家看着高高的模型盒子，又看着密密的铁筋网，一个人侧着身子刚挤进去，一进去后就像蹲在铁笼子里一样，不能自由活动。可是现在不仅要钻进去，还要用手托着震动器工作，不仅要工作，而且要保证工程质量完全合乎规格。丁阳忠在铁筋网外观看了半天，决定了自己的工作方法：上身钻那个孔，震动器放在那里，手从那个孔伸出去托着震动器……他观察好就钻进去了，一直到震动好了才出来。等他出来后，上半身完全成了个泥人了。有人笑他，叫他到水坑里去照个像。丁阳忠笑着说：你看我不好看，打出来的混凝土溜光，可好看啦！我要好看了，打出来的混凝土可就难看了。共产党员李贵、孙荣，青年团员王海春、刘玉林都跟着钻进铁筋网里去工作了，连老组长王连也这样工作着。
    经过各方面的努力，已在二十七小时打完了一个分段号。这时，支部进一步提出了：再加一把劲，保证二十五小时打完一个分段号的鼓动口号。最后，不仅达到了二十五小时，并且只要十九小时就打完了一个分段号。
    八千八百立方公尺的混凝土任务，终于提前完成了。
