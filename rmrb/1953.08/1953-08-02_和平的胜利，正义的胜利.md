My dear volunteer comrades: In the past few days, peace-loving people all over the world have been cheering and rejoicing. Because the Korean War has finally stopped; because the Korean War has stopped, it is not just the end of gunfire on the Korean front, but it has once again extinguished and stopped the fire of aggressive war throughout the world. Did war destroy and undermine peace? Or did peace repel and stop war? Now the facts have very clearly told everyone: Peace has won, justice has won, and you—the people who hold high the banner of peace and justice—have won.

Dear comrades! At this moment, you know that it is not just me, but all peace-loving people, from the motherland and from all over the world, are sending heartfelt thanks to you. All hearts are flying to you, rushing to you, all arms are reaching out to you, all eyes are watching you, all voices are cheering for you... All of this is more numerous than the stars in the sky, and more precious than the flowers on the ground, because everyone's heart is filled with the most sincere love for you. Everyone knows that only when you cross the ice river, plunge into the flames, use your chest to resist the sharp shrapnel, and shed your blood on the ground, can the day that people all over the world have prayed for and longed for—the day of the armistice—arrive, and the first ray of dawn rise on the battlefield.

Not only today, but in the future, people will never forget how you selflessly stood up and joined the battle in that most difficult winter. The invaders at that time were not like this now. Think about it: How rampant and overbearing they were at that time, how ferocious their faces were, and how aggressive their arrogance was, like a raging fire. Now in my hand, there are some confessions from the invaders themselves. It is very meaningful to look at them again today:

"...Corpses were lying across the road near Kimpo Airport, and the remains in the middle of the road were blurred by the American heavy tanks. MacArthur, the 'Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces' of the United States, was inspecting the surrounding area. ...In this scene, MacArthur glanced at the four Korean soldiers with a contemptuous look and said: 'In my old eyes, this is a beautiful sight!'" (Reuters reporter McGartney)

"...MacArthur announced on Friday that he would launch an 'end the war' offensive on the western front of Korea. This statement was issued by MacArthur in Korea. He personally ordered the Eighth Army to send 100,000 troops to attack the Yalu River..." (November 24, 1950, Associated Press)

It was at that time that you and the heroic Korean people stood together. You did not bow your heads, did not look back, and you bravely fought back against the brutal enemy. At that time, friends all over the world were hoping for you, yet worried about you, trusting you, yet concerned about you. Dear comrades, from that difficult time, you took on the responsibility of the front line in the world's struggle to defend peace. The peace-loving people of the world placed their hopes on you. They knew: Only when you win can babies sleep peacefully; only when you advance can mothers smile. Therefore, for so many dark nights and so many days, people were sometimes uneasy because they could not get news from you, just like the red flag of the assault troops on the battlefield was suddenly covered by smoke. But it was precisely at that time that the hearts of the peace-loving people of the world became more and more closely linked with you. You not only represented the will of the people of the motherland, but you also represented the will of the peace-loving people of the world, because what people hate is war, and you are eliminating war; what people long for is peace, and you are fighting for peace with blood and life.

However, dear comrades! I know how much hardship it took to achieve peace. At this time, I think of the many important positions I personally visited, from the east coast to the west coast of Korea; I think of the heroes I personally visited. The first time I went to the Korean front was in the first winter. At that time, the wind and snow were blowing on the firelight, and the enemy poured hundreds of tons of steel onto the battlefield. I saw you enduring the unbearable cold, fighting in the wind and snow and in the ice river, using your fingers, frozen purple, to pull the trigger. You ate a handful of parched flour and a handful of snow, and several people had to share a cigarette rolled with enemy leaflets. Your equipment was not as good as the enemy's, but you said: "I will bend steel, and I will smash demons and ghosts to pieces!" At that time, I saw with my own eyes how difficult it was to fight for peace. The second time I went to the Korean front last year, the situation was very different, but the fierce artillery fire had already blasted the hard rock on the forward positions into a layer of red dust. Everything was exploding, everything was burning, and I once again personally experienced how difficult it was to fight for peace. However, all this severe cold, wind, snow, cruel bombing and strafing, raging floods, the burning of gasoline bombs, and the poisoning of bacteria, all these hardships, were conquered by you, were eliminated by you. From then on, your footsteps in the continuous advance on the Korean battlefield brought new shocks and new joys to the world every day.

Some people in the world may still not understand why our people are so brave? The invaders cannot understand even more. They say they cannot understand why people can be so "fanatical". Yes, they rush to where there is fire, they rush to where there are bombs, but this is by no means due to any magical secret, but because you are new Chinese people, because in your hearts there is a greater force than this fire, than this bomb, that is, the love for peace, for happiness, for the motherland, for the tomorrow of mankind, and that noble and strong character of daring to sacrifice oneself for all these ideals. Today, the gunfire has stopped, the firelight has gone out, and people look to the future and talk about the beginning of peace. I believe that when everyone talks like this, the perfect heroic image of the volunteer army will immediately appear before their eyes. We remember Yang Gensi, who held explosives and rushed towards the enemy on the east mountain of Xiajieyuli, Huang Jiguang, who blocked the enemy's gun with his body on Shangganling, and Qiu Shaoyun, who was burned to death by the fire for the sake of the whole... Countless heroes are like countless flags, and countless heroes are like countless statues standing on the peaks. People all over the world can see them. We want to thank them and remember them forever. But we remember more of every commander, fighter, and all the staff of the volunteer army. Dear comrades! At this moment, how I want to rush to your side, to shake hands and embrace you tightly, because each of you has demonstrated this noble and strong character. You have made the greatest efforts to resist aggression and defend peace. We want to thank you and remember you forever. Now let us recall everyone's experience! When a person crossed the Yalu River in October 1950, he saw the overwhelming war, and he thought of his motherland and homeland; on the other hand, he was aroused by the cruel fate of Korean brothers and sisters and a deeper hatred for the invaders. In this hatred, he combined his love for the motherland with his love for Korean brothers. His heart was filled with a new feeling, a new hatred, and a new love. He fought. He went through the first three battles in the raging storm. His comrades died beside the burning houses. He shed tears, but he withstood the most difficult battles, fighting, and he fought to the end in the dust and smoke. He lost weight, he remained silent, but he went through the real baptism of fire. The night of raging storms passed, and the light of dawn shone on his face. The situation on the Korean battlefield changed. At this time, he looked back, and the sun shone on the motherland, shining on the elderly and infants on the Korean land. At this time, his emotions were like the dazzling dawn, and his thoughts were more enriched and richer in the battle. The entire future of the motherland, Korea, and the world was filled in his heart. He is a victorious person. Think about it, on the Korean battlefield, which person has not gone through a road of overcoming difficulties and unswervingly, and then become a new person, standing at the forefront of the times, setting an example for millions of young people and children, and becoming a truly glorious Mao Zedong era person.

Here I want to tell you something that I will never forget in my life. Now there is an envelope in front of me with a peace dove painted on it by a soldier. This was personally given to me by three soldiers before a battle on the Imjin River front last October. They said: "For the sake of peace, we will continue to strike the enemy!" I watched them walk to the front line. Who knew that after a night of fierce fighting, two of the three soldiers would never return to us for the sake of peace. They contributed their lives for the sake of peace. What could be more touching than this in the world? Every time I see the peace dove on this envelope, I feel infinitely proud and honored for our heroes. Let the peace dove fly freely in front of the people of the world! Let everyone, at every moment, when he enjoys a peaceful life, kindly think of the name of the heroic volunteer army!

Your names will be forever engraved in people's hearts and engraved on every peaceful construction project. Today, the lights on every construction site in the motherland, the red light on every iron-smelting furnace, the new discoveries of every drilling machine, every achievement, every progress are inseparable from you.

The precious and lovely name "Volunteer Army" has shone like sunlight in various places. You only need to listen to the heartfelt joyful voices of children calling this name, you only need to look at the infinitely loving eyes of children when they see this name, and you will understand that this precious name not only lives in people's hearts, but also lives in people's lives. Dear comrades! Accept this noble honor! Glory should belong to you! Cherish this noble honor! This glory will be the most precious and glorious influence you give to our future generations.

The violent wind and snow of 1950 have passed forever, and the initial hope of the peace-loving people of the world has been realized. You have not disappointed their hopes at all. From the very beginning, they watched you with their own eyes, watching the banner of peace and justice that you raised, passing through the flames, through the whistling rain of bullets, through the cruel historical stage of 1950 and 1951. People have seen with their own eyes that this banner is becoming more and more distinct and more and more glorious. Who doesn't know that the brilliance on this banner is the brilliance of your life. Peace has been rescued from blood and fire, and peace has been rescued through countless hardships and continuous efforts. Peace is therefore more lovely, more precious, more worthy of cherishing, and more worthy of protecting. Today, the gunfire has stopped, but we must remember: The armistice is only the first step towards peace. We hope that the first day of the cessation of gunfire will bring a permanent cessation of gunfire. We hope that the dawn will bring a brilliant dawn of peace. Then, we must be solemnly vigilant, and first of all, we need you to more strongly defend and protect our victorious banner, the banner of peace. Let the banner of peace always fly in front of us, let people always look at the brilliance of your lives, let people always cherish the name of the heroic volunteer army! Let people firmly and more firmly defend peace.

    和平的胜利，正义的胜利
    刘白羽
    亲爱的志愿军同志们：这几天来，全世界爱好和平的人们都在欢腾鼓舞。因为朝鲜战争终于停止下来了；因为朝鲜战争停止，不仅仅是朝鲜前线停止了枪声，而是在全世界范围里面，又一次扑灭了、制止了侵略战争的火灾。是战争毁灭了、破坏了和平呢？还是和平击退了、制止了战争呢？现在事实已经非常鲜明地告诉大家：是和平胜利了，是正义胜利了，是你们——高举着和平与正义的旗子的人们胜利了。
    亲爱的同志们！在这个时候，你们知道，不是我一个人，而是所有爱好和平的人，从祖国、从全世界各个地方，都在把衷心的感谢送给你们，所有的心都在飞向你们、奔向你们，所有的臂膀都向你们伸开，所有的眼睛都望着你们，所有的声音都在向你们欢呼，……这一切比天上的星辰还要多，比地上的鲜花还更值得珍贵，因为每一个人心里都充满了对你们最真诚的爱。每个人都知道，只有你们穿过冰河、扑进火焰，拿胸膛抵着锐利的弹片，把自己的鲜血流在地面上，全世界人民所祈求、所盼望的一天——停战的一天才能到来，战场上才升起第一线曙光。
    不但是今天，就是将来，人们永远也不会忘记：你们在那最危难的冬天，怎样忘我地站起来投入战斗。那时候的侵略者可不是现在这样，想一想：那时候他们是多么猖狂，多么跋扈，嘴脸是多么凶残，气焰如同熊熊烈火是多么咄咄逼人。现在在我手边，有一些从侵略者自己口中说出来的供词，今天再看一看，是很有意义的：
    “……在金浦机场附近公路上尸体横陈，路中间的遗尸被美国重坦克碾得血肉模糊。美国的‘联合国军总司令’麦克阿瑟正在这儿的周围视察。……在这个景象中，麦克阿瑟以卑视的目光对着四个朝鲜兵士看了一下，并且说：‘在我的老眼看来，这真是一幅美丽的景象！’……”（路透社记者麦加特尼）
    “……麦克阿瑟曾于星期五宣布要在朝鲜西线进行‘结束战争’的攻击。这一声明是麦克阿瑟在朝鲜发布的。他亲自在那里下令派遣第八军十万人向鸭绿江进攻。……”（一九五○年十一月二十四日，合众社）
    就在那时候，你们和英勇的朝鲜人民在一起，你们没有低头，没有回顾，你们挺身迎击残暴的敌人。那时候，全世界的朋友，对你们希望着可又悬虑着，信任着可又担心着。亲爱的同志们，从那危难的时候起，你们就担负起全世界保卫和平斗争前哨的责任。全世界和平人民就把他们的希望寄托在你们身上。他们知道：你们胜利，婴儿才能以安眠；你们前进，母亲才能以微笑。因此，多少个黑夜又多少个白天，人们有时由于得不到你们的消息而不安，就像战场上突击部队的红旗一下被烟雾遮盖。可是正是在那个时候，全世界和平人民的心和你们就愈来愈紧密地结合在一起了。你们不仅仅代表了祖国人民的心意，你们也代表了全世界和平人民的心意，因为人们所憎恨的是战争，你们在消灭战争；人们所盼望的是和平，你们在用血与生命争取和平。
    可是，亲爱的同志们！我知道和平是经过多么巨大的艰苦才取得的。这时我想起我亲身到过的、从朝鲜东海岸到西海岸那许多重要的阵地；我想起我亲身访问过的英雄们。我第一次到朝鲜前线是头一个冬天，那时候大风雪吹着火光，敌人把成百吨的钢铁倾泻在战场上，我看见你们忍受着难忍的寒冷，在风雪在冰河里作战，用冻得发紫的手指扳着枪机，你们一把炒面一把雪，一根用敌人传单卷起的烟卷也要好几个人分抽，你们的装备不如敌人，可是你们说：“是钢铁我要把你拗弯，是妖魔鬼怪我也要把你砸得稀烂！”那时我亲眼看到：和平的争取是多么艰苦。我去年第二次到朝鲜前线，情况已经大不相同，但是猛烈的炮火已经把前沿阵地上坚硬的石岩炸成一层红色的尘土，一切都在爆炸，一切都在燃烧，我又一次亲身体验到，和平的争取是怎样的艰难。不过，这一切严寒、风雪、残酷的轰炸扫射、暴涨的洪水、汽油弹的焚烧、细菌的毒害，所有这些艰难困苦，都被你们征服了，都被你们排除了，从此你们在朝鲜战场上不断前进的脚步声，每天给全世界带来新的震动、新的欢乐。
    世界上有一部分人到现在也许还不明白，为什么我们的人是这样勇敢？侵略者更无从理解，他们说他们无法了解为什么人能够这样“热狂”。是的，那里有火扑上去，那里是炸弹奔过去，可是这绝不由于什么神奇的秘密，而就因为你们是新中国人，因为在你们心中有比这火、比这炸弹更巨大的力量，那就是对和平、对幸福、对祖国、对人类明天的热爱，以及为这一切理想，而勇于自我牺牲的那种崇高、坚强的品德。今天，枪声停止了，火光熄灭了，人们展望未来，谈到和平的开端，我相信每一个人这样谈话的时候，志愿军完美的英雄形象立刻就出现在眼前。我们记起那在下碣隅里东山上抱着炸药冲向敌人的杨根思，在上甘岭以身体抵住敌人枪眼的黄继光，为了整体而自己被烈火焚毁的邱少云，……无数英雄像无数面旗帜，无数英雄像无数座雕像兀立在高峰上，全世界上的人都能看到他们。我们要感谢他们，永远记住他们。但是我们更多的记起每一个每一个志愿军的指挥员、战士和所有工作人员。亲爱的同志们！这时我多么想飞奔到你们身边，和你们紧紧的握手、拥抱，因为你们每一个人身上都表现出这种崇高的坚强的品德，你们为抵抗侵略、保卫和平尽了最大的努力，我们要感谢你们，永远记着你们。现在让我们回想一下每一个人的经历吧！当一个人在一九五○年十月跨过了鸭绿江，他看见那弥天战火，他想到自己的祖国、家园；另外一方面，他从朝鲜兄弟姊妹残酷的命运里，激起对侵略者更深的仇恨。在这种仇恨中把对祖国的爱和对朝鲜兄弟的爱结合在一起，他心里充满一种新的感情、新的仇恨和新的爱，他战斗了。他通过那狂风暴雨的前三个战役，在那燃烧的房屋旁战友死亡了，他流了泪，但他抗住了最艰巨的拚杀，搏斗，在尘土和硝烟中他战到最后，他瘦了，他不声不响，但是他经过了真正的火的洗炼。狂风暴雨的夜晚过去了，黎明的光迎面照来，朝鲜战场上形势变化了。这时他回过头看一看，阳光照耀着祖国，照耀着朝鲜土地上的老年人和婴儿，这时他的情感就和那照人的黎明一样，他的思想在战斗中更充实、更丰富了，整个祖国、朝鲜和全世界的未来的明天，充满在他的心里。他是一个战胜了的人，想一想，在朝鲜战场上，那一个人不是经过一条战胜困难、百折不回的道路，而后成为一个新生的人，站在时代最前面的人，为千百万青年和儿童作榜样的人，成为真正光辉灿烂的毛泽东时代的人。
    我这里想讲一件我一生一世不能忘记的事。现在我面前摆着一个信封，信封上面有战士画的一只和平鸽子。这是去年十月在临津江前线一次战斗之前，三个战士亲手交给我的。他们说：“为了和平，我们将要不断地打击敌人！”我看着他们走上火线。谁知经过一夜激烈战斗之后，三个战士中有两个战士，为了和平而永远不再回到我们面前来了，为了和平他们贡献了自己的生命了，在世界上有什么比这更感动人的事呢？我每一次看这信封上的和平鸽，我都为我们的英雄感到无比的骄傲、无比的光荣。让和平鸽在全世界人民的面前自由飞翔吧！让每一个人在每一刻时间里，当他享受着和平生活时，都亲切的想起英雄志愿军的名字吧！
    你们的名字将永远镌刻在人们心中，镌刻在每一和平建设事业上。今天，祖国每一个工地上的灯火，每一座熔铁炉上的红光，每一个钻探机的新发现，每一种成绩，每一种进步都和你们分不开，
    “志愿军”这珍贵、可爱的名字，它已经像阳光一样闪耀在各个地方，你只要听一听孩子们呼唤着这个名字时那衷心的欢欣的声音，你只要看一看孩子们看到这个名字时那无限敬爱的眼光，你就懂得，这个珍贵的名字，它不但活在人们心上，同时它已经活在人们的生命里面了。亲爱的同志们！你们接受这种崇高的荣誉吧！光荣应该属于你们！你们爱护这种崇高的荣誉吧！这种光荣将是你们给我们后代人最宝贵、最光辉的影响。
    一九五○年那狂暴的风雪永远地吹过去了，全世界和平人民的最初的希望实现了，你们一点也没有辜负他们的希望。从最初那个时候起，他们亲眼看着你们，看着你们所举起的和平与正义的旗子，穿过火焰、穿过呼呼飞啸的弹雨，穿过一九五○年一九五一年残酷的历史阶段。人们都亲眼看见，这面旗子愈来愈鲜明，愈来愈光辉，谁不知道这旗子上的光辉就是你们生命的光辉呀。和平从血与火中被拯救了，和平经过千难万苦，前仆后继而被拯救了。和平也就更可爱、更宝贵、更值得珍惜、更应该保护。今天，枪声停止了，可我们要记着：停战只是和平的第一步，我们希望第一天停止枪声带来永久的停止枪声，我们希望曙光带来和平的灿烂的黎明，那么，我们就必须庄严地警惕着、首先就需要你们更坚强地保卫、保护我们胜利的旗子，和平的旗子。让和平的旗子永远在我们前面飘扬，让人们永远看着你们的生命的光辉，让人们永远珍爱着英雄的志愿军的名字吧！让人们坚强更坚强的保卫着和平。
