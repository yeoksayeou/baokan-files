Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Central Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives signed an agreement on August 11th regarding the entrusted purchase of cotton. The agreement stipulates that all cotton produced in the provinces within the customs this year will be purchased by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives on behalf of the Central Ministry of Commerce.

The agreement makes principled provisions for formulating purchase plans, controlling prices, and utilizing funds in cotton purchasing operations. Regarding the quality of cotton purchased, the agreement stipulates that cooperatives have the responsibility to mobilize farmers to sun-dry and pick cotton, avoid collecting "peach cotton" (cotton picked from unripe bolls), and pick cotton when it is ripe to improve cotton quality. It also encourages farmers to sell seed cotton during the purchase process.

The Central Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives have jointly issued instructions requiring the commercial departments and cooperative federations of all cotton-producing provinces to promptly sign specific agency purchase contracts based on the principles stipulated in the agreement and in conjunction with local conditions, and to vigorously implement them to ensure the smooth completion of the new cotton purchase work.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The All-China Federation of Cooperatives issued instructions to cooperatives in all cotton-producing areas on August 17th regarding efforts to do a good job in purchasing cotton. The instructions require local cooperatives to effectively integrate cotton purchasing plans with the quantities of cotton farmers want to sell, and to correctly implement the state-prescribed cotton-grain price ratio policy and the policy of better prices for better cotton, in order to complete the cotton purchasing task.

The instructions state that in formulating cotton purchasing operation plans, cooperatives in all cotton-producing areas must closely link all aspects. In order to formulate more realistic purchase plans, cooperatives purchasing cotton should conduct practical investigations and research into local cotton growth conditions, planting area, yield, marketable quantity, and the laws governing when cotton is put on the market at different times, as a basis for formulating or revising purchase plans.

The instructions emphasized: The price of cotton is related to the vital interests of farmers and is a crucial key to doing a good job in purchasing and consolidating the relationship between cooperatives and farmers. Last year, due to the seasonal price differences in cotton, it was common for farmers to rush to sell their cotton as soon as the new cotton was on the market, but the cooperatives could not purchase it in time. At the same time, the trade departments and cooperatives could not supply farmers with the necessary materials in a timely manner as much as possible, which affected the interests of cotton-selling farmers. This year, taking this situation into consideration and in order to take care of the interests of farmers who sell cotton later, the state has prescribed reasonable seasonal price differences for cotton. This regulation not only conforms to the actual situation of cotton purchasing, but also conforms to the interests of farmers. However, because this regulation did not exist last year, cooperatives in all areas should vigorously publicize and explain the seasonal price differences to farmers, eliminate farmers' eagerness to sell, and use historical materials to educate farmers, so that they understand that the reduced cotton price this year still guarantees the interests of cotton farmers, and that farmers sell cotton to the state in accordance with the purchase plan, so that the textile industry can continuously obtain raw materials and ensure production. At the same time, in the inspection work, all levels of cooperatives should strengthen policy education and technical education for inspectors, and strive to be "fair with scales, accurate with grading," and overcome the biases of suppressing grades and prices and raising grades and prices. And, where possible, listen to the opinions of farmers and carry out democratic grading work.

These instructions pointed out to the cadres of cotton-producing cooperatives: Doing a good job in supplying materials in cotton-producing areas is an equally important and arduous task as purchasing. In order to enable farmers to obtain the necessary means of subsistence and means of production in a timely manner, cooperatives at all levels should closely cooperate with state-owned trade departments to investigate the needs of cotton farmers, formulate realistic supply plans, maintain reasonable material reserves, organize local sources of goods as much as possible, appropriately set up supply stations, and vigorously organize allocation. Expand the supply of cotton cloth, daily necessities, small farm tools, timber, and non-staple foods, and in particular, supply the handicrafts and local and special products needed by farmers, and do their best to meet the needs of the masses, rather than simply relying on external transfers and being out of touch with the actual needs of the masses. Whether or not the required materials can be supplied to farmers in a timely manner is the key to whether the purchase plan can be completed. The idea of ​​some cadres who emphasize purchasing and neglect supply should be properly criticized.

Finally, the instructions require cooperative federations at the provincial level and above to organize inspection teams to go deep into grassroots purchasing stations after the cotton harvesting work begins in various places, mainly to concretely understand the situation of cotton farmers selling cotton, the supply of materials, and cotton farmers' opinions on purchasing prices and grading and inspection, so as to improve the work in a timely manner.

    中央商业部委托合作社代购关内各省棉花
    全国合作总社发出购棉工作指示
    【新华社十七日讯】中央人民政府商业部和中华全国合作社联合总社在八月十一日签订了代购棉花协议书。协议书规定，今年度关内各省所产棉花，由中央商业部全部委托中华全国合作社联合总社代购。
    这个协议书对购棉经营中制订收购计划、掌握价格、运用资金等方面都作了原则规定。在购棉品质方面，规定合作社有责任发动农民晒花、拣花、避免剥桃棉，应成熟摘花，以提高棉花质量。并在收购中鼓励农民出售籽棉。
    中央商业部和中华全国合作社联合总社已联合发出指示，要求各产棉省份的人民政府商业厅和合作社联合社根据协议所规定的原则，结合当地情况迅速签订具体代购合同，努力贯彻执行，以保证新棉收购工作的顺利完成。
    【新华社十七日讯】中华全国合作社联合总社在八月十七日向各棉产区合作社发出了关于努力做好收购棉花工作的指示。这个指示要求各地合作社把购棉计划和农民要求售棉的数量切实结合起来。并正确执行国家规定的棉粮比价政策和优棉优价政策，完成购棉任务。
    指示说，各产棉区合作社在制订购棉经营计划时，各个环节要密切衔接。为了订出比较合乎实际的收购计划，收购棉花的合作社均应对本地棉花生长情况、播种面积、产量、商品量及不同时期的上市规律等，作实际的调查研究，作为制订或修改收购计划的依据。
    指示着重指出：棉花价格是关系到农民切身利益，是做好收购工作巩固合作社和农民的联系的重要关键。去年，曾因棉花季节差价关系，新棉上市后，曾普遍发生农民急于出售而合作社收购不及，同时，贸易部门和合作社也不能尽量地及时供应给农民以必要的物资，这就影响了售棉农民的利益。今年考虑到这种情况，并为了照顾迟卖棉花的农民利益，国家规定了合理的棉花季节差价。这个规定不但符合收购棉花的实际状况，而且也符合农民的利益。但因这个规定是去年所没有的，因此，各地合作社应大力向农民进行季节差价的宣传解释工作，消除棉农的急售思想，并用历史材料教育农民，使其了解今年减低了的棉花价格，仍然保证了棉农的利益，使农民按照收购计划，把棉花卖给国家，使纺织工业不断得到原料，保证生产。同时，在检验工作上各级社应加强对验级人员的政策教育和技术教育，力求“磅秤平、验级准”，克服压级压价和提级提价的偏向。并在可能条件下听取农民的意见，展开民主评级工作。
    这个指示向棉区合作社干部指出：做好棉区的物资供应工作，是和收购工作同样重要的一项艰巨任务。为使农民及时得到需要的生活资料和生产资料，各级社应密切配合国营贸易部门调查棉农的需要，制订切实的供应计划，保持合理的物资储备，尽量组织地方货源，适当设置供应站，大力组织调拨。扩大纱布、日用百货、小农具、木材和副食品的供应，特别应供应农民需要的手工业和土特产品，尽力满足群众的需要，而不要单纯仰仗外调，脱离群众的实际需要。能否及时供应给农民以所需物资，是收购计划能否完成的关键，某些干部重收购轻供应的思想应受到正当的批评。
    指示最后要求省级以上各级合作社联合社，在各地收棉工作开始以后，组织检查组深入到基层收购站，主要是对棉农出售棉花的情况、物资供应情况、棉农对收购价格和分级检验的意见等作具体的了解，以便及时改进工作。
