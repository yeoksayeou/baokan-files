Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to People's Daily

    Liaoxi Iron Factory Takes Concrete Measures to Remedy Defects of Inferior Waterwheel Quality

    A letter from Zhang Tieiren and Yang Jimin, Factory Director and Xie Wenrong, Deputy Factory Director of Liaoxi Iron Factory: After reading the criticism from reader Liu Zizhen in the July 21st newspaper regarding the poor quality of our factory's waterwheels, we convened a factory meeting for inspection. We would like to inform you of the inspection results and improvement measures.

    As early as April this year, water conservancy cadres from various counties and cities in Liaoxi Province pointed out the poor quality of our factory's waterwheels. At that time, we decided to replace the sold inferior waterwheels, and so far, we have replaced about seventy parts. In July, Hebei Province also raised concerns about the quality of our factory's waterwheels. We also sent cadres and workers to the province to understand the situation and repair the damaged waterwheels. The reasons for the poor quality and high cost of our factory's waterwheels are mainly poor management and operation of the factory, and the leadership's one-sided focus on tasks, neglecting product quality. This situation has affected farmers' production and damaged the credibility of the People's Government. In addition to thoroughly inspecting our work, we have made the following decisions:

    For any sold waterwheels with damaged parts, our factory will be responsible for repairing or replacing them; if users have already fitted parts themselves or found someone to repair them, it will be handled on a case-by-case basis. In order to improve the quality of waterwheels in the future, our factory will send technicians to organize a working group to investigate the damage and causes of waterwheels in various counties in Hebei Province, purchase waterwheels produced by Shanxi Machine Factory for reference and research, and improve specifications and strengthen inspection during the production of parts, so that unqualified waterwheels do not leave the factory. In addition, we will strive to reduce costs in the future, provide necessary parts with each waterwheel, and make the price of waterwheels the same as those of Shanxi Machine Factory.

    The Leadership Issue of Jiulongpo Temporary Machine Factory Has Been Clearly Defined by the Ministry of Railways

    A letter from the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Bureau and the Labor and Wage Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on July 21st published a letter from Pan Liang and seven other employees of the Jiulongpo Temporary Machine Factory of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, requesting the Ministry of Railways to quickly resolve the leadership issue of the factory. The main reason why the factory is in a state of no leadership is that our Ministry of Railways'主管局 (responsible bureau) did not make a clear instruction to the Chongqing Railway Bureau in the past. Therefore, the Chongqing Railway Administration has always believed that they were managing the factory on behalf of the Ministry of Railways. Now, the Ministry of Railways has clearly stipulated that the factory is under the jurisdiction of the Chongqing Railway Administration. In the future, all plans, tasks, and management work related to the factory will be the responsibility of the Chongqing Railway Administration.

    Jingxing Mining Bureau Drilling Team Determined to Strengthen the Preservation of Geological Data

    A letter from the Party Committee of Jingxing Mining Bureau: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column of the People's Daily on July 25 published a letter from readers Wang Qingxu and Xie Deming criticizing our bureau's drilling team for neglecting the preservation of geological data. This criticism is completely correct. We convened relevant personnel to hold a meeting to examine this issue. The drilling team leader and chief recorder both reviewed the past lack of care for the state's geological data, and did not recognize that neglecting the preservation of rock and coal cores would directly affect the correct construction design and would bring losses to the country's economic construction. Therefore, the accident of two boxes of rock and coal cores being powdered and losing their research value was caused. The comrades of the drilling team promised to correct this error in the future and have initially established some systems in terms of geological data preservation.

    Xuan Cheng Work Zone of Wuhu Highway Management Section Has Inspected the Reasons for the Death of Saplings

    A letter from Xuan Cheng Work Zone of Wuhu Highway Management Section of Anhui Province Transportation Department Highway Bureau: The criticism from readers Lou Rihui et al. published in the July 4th newspaper regarding the problem of many saplings dying on both sides of the highway in Guangde County is correct. The reasons for this situation are, on the one hand, that we did not understand the local soil conditions and lacked experience in selecting seedlings; on the other hand, these saplings were contracted to others for planting, and the contract stipulated that they would be responsible for planting and ensuring survival, and if there were any deaths or breakages, the contractor would replant them next year, so we mistakenly planted them and did not care about them. We will definitely correct this error in the future. However, the original letter of criticism underestimates the enthusiasm of the local people for protecting the saplings. In fact, local farmers automatically assist us in protecting the road and seedlings during the agricultural off-season, and their spirit of caring for the People's Highway is worthy of praise.

### 对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    辽西铁工厂采取具体措施补救水车质量低劣的缺点
    辽西铁工厂厂长张铁人、杨济民，副厂长谢文荣来信：看到七月二十一日报上读者刘自箴对我厂水车质量不好的问题提出批评后，我们就召开厂务会议进行检查。现将检查结果和改进意见告诉你们。
    早在今年四月，辽西省各县市水利干部就指出我厂水车质量低劣。当时我们决定把已售出的劣质水车换回，到现在为止已更换部件七十件左右。七月份，热河省各地又对我厂水车质量提出意见。我们也派了干部和工人到该省去进行了解，并修整损坏的水车。我厂水车质量低、成本高的原因，主要是工厂经营管理不善，领导方面有单纯任务观点，不重视产品质量。这种情况已经影响了农民的生产，并损害了人民政府的威信。我们除了切实检查工作外，并作出如下决定：
    凡是已售出的水车中部件有损坏者，由我厂负责修理或更换；如用户已自配部件或找人修理，则根据具体情况分别处理。为了改进今后水车质量，我厂将派技术人员组织工作组到热河各县调查水车损坏情况和原因，购买山西机器厂出品的水车来参考研究，并在生产部件时提高规格、加强检查，做到不合格的水车不出厂。此外，我们今后争取降低成本，做到每辆水车附带必要零件，并使水车价格和山西机器厂的相同。
    九龙坡临时机厂的领导问题中央铁道部已作明确规定
    中央人民政府铁道部机车车辆修理局、劳动工资局来信：七月二十一日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了成渝铁路九龙坡临时机厂职工潘亮等八人来信，要求中央铁道部迅速解决该厂的领导问题。该厂所以处于无人领导状态，主要原因是我们铁道部主管局过去对重庆局未作明确指示。因此，重庆铁路管理局一向认为他们是替铁道部代管该厂。现在中央铁道部已明确规定该厂隶属重庆铁路管理局。以后有关该厂的一切计划、任务、管理等工作，均由重庆铁路管理局负责。
    井陉矿务局钻探队决心加强地质资料保管工作
    井陉矿务局党委会来信：七月二十五日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏刊登了读者王清戌、谢德明对我局钻探队忽视保管地质资料的批评信。这个批评是完全正确的。我们召集了有关人员开会检查了这个问题。钻探队队长及总记录员都检讨了过去对国家地质资料爱护不够，没有认识到忽视岩、煤芯的保管就直接影响了正确的施工设计，会给国家的经济建设事业带来损失；因此，就造成了两箱岩、煤芯粉化而丧失了研究价值的事故。钻探队同志保证今后纠正这种错误，并在地质资料保管工作方面初步订立了一些制度。
    芜湖公路管理段宣城工区对树苗死亡原因已做检查
    安徽省交通厅公路局芜湖公路管理段宣城工区来信：七月四日报上刊登的读者楼日辉等对广德县公路两旁所栽树苗枯死很多问题的批评是正确的。造成这种情况的原因，一方面是我们对当地土壤情况不了解，缺乏选苗经验；另一方面，这些树苗是包给人家栽植的，合同规定包栽包活，如有枯死折断由承包人明年补植，因此我们就错误地栽下不管了。我们今后定当改正这种错误。但是，原批评信中对当地群众保护树苗热情估计是不足的。事实上，当地农民在农闲时自动协助我们护路护苗，爱护人民公路的精神是值得表扬的。
