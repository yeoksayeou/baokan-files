Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 9th: On August 9th, our side repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war and 250 Korean prisoners of war to the other side, totaling 400 people. Among the non-Korean prisoners of war were 112 Americans, 21 British, 13 Turkish, 2 Australians, and 1 each from Canada and the Philippines. The other side repatriated 2,272 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side, including 473 female prisoners of war; 601 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, including one female prisoner of war; totaling 2,873 people. In addition, 23 children returned with their mothers.
According to the other side's original notification, there were no wounded or sick personnel among the prisoners of war repatriated to our side today. However, there were three female prisoners of war who required stretchers.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 9th: Among the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war repatriated during the first three days, many were disabled, seriously wounded, or suffering from long-term serious illnesses. Some of them were injured by the U.S. side near the time of repatriation after the armistice agreement was signed; some should have been repatriated as early as April this year, but the U.S. side delayed them until now without any reason.

Shang Rencai's eyes were burned by gas bombs in the U.S. prisoner of war camp, causing them to be red, swollen, and constantly tearing. He suffered from chest and abdominal pain and had difficulty breathing. He said that on July 28th, the day they left the 8th prisoner of war camp on Jeju Island, they requested the U.S. prisoner of war camp authorities to release and repatriate Wang Fang, Wei Lin, and more than a dozen other captured officers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who were being detained separately. The U.S. side not only refused this just request but also threw poisonous gas bombs at them. As a result, 500 of the more than 600 prisoners of war on our side were poisoned, and 200 of them fainted on the spot. Shang Rencai was hit by two poisonous gas bombs.

Among the returned personnel were also many seriously wounded soldiers, all of whom were injured by the U.S. military on October 1st last year for raising the flag to commemorate National Day. Ma Haochou, who suffered injuries in three places in his abdomen, arms, and legs, had four experimental operations performed by the U.S. side, which resulted in increasingly serious injuries, and finally, his leg became disabled. He said indignantly: "The U.S. side did not treat our injuries but treated us as experimental subjects. This is the 'humanitarianism' of the United States."

The returned personnel said that in the U.S. prisoner of war camps, they could only eat half-raw barley grains with the skin on every day, and there was no oil to eat. The tents they lived in were damp, with only a little straw as a mattress, and they slept on it. During the day, the U.S. military did not allow them to take the wet straw outside the tent to dry it. Therefore, many prisoners of war on our side suffered from severe illnesses such as edema, eczema, scabies, gastroenteritis, tracheitis, and lung diseases. In addition, many prisoners of war on our side suffered severe nerve damage and became mentally ill due to beatings by the U.S. side. Among the prisoners of war on the Korean-Chinese side repatriated during the first three days, there were as many as eighty-eight mental patients.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 9th: Our correspondent reports: The prisoners of war repatriated on the 8th, like those repatriated in the past few days, returned wearing self-made military caps. They angrily threw away the tattered clothes issued by the U.S. side and only cherished the cigarettes and canned goods given to them by our representatives of the South Group of the Joint Red Cross.

After getting off the train, they told people: We have not had a drop of water for three days and three nights, and some people have not slept for more than forty hours. Cai Jingming, a disabled prisoner of war from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, said: "The United States is not willing to let us return to our motherland. On May 18th, the Americans forced us to go to Taiwan. When we refused, they beat us." In addition, five other prisoners of war on our side were beaten and disabled along with him.

Among those who returned on the 8th, many Korean People's Army prisoners of war immediately accused the U.S. side of forcibly detaining prisoners of war on our side before and after the armistice. Many of the returning Volunteer Army personnel were seriously ill, but the U.S. side did not classify them as wounded or sick prisoners of war. On a U.S. truck carrying non-sick personnel, one severely ill Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war had been jostled into unconsciousness and was dying. After emergency rescue by the Korean-Chinese Red Cross emergency station, the returned personnel were out of danger. While unconscious, this returned personnel kept shouting:
"Resolutely return to the motherland, resolutely return to the motherland!"

Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: The American news agencies, ordered to fabricate lies about our side's "mistreatment" of prisoners of war, are finding it difficult to cover up the truth and cannot help but reveal in their news that some of the repatriated American and British prisoners of war are constantly talking about the humanitarian treatment given to them by the Korean-Chinese side.

United Press reporter Panton admitted on the 7th that three repatriated American prisoners of war told him that they were treated fairly well. One 23-year-old American soldier said that because the Korean-Chinese side treated him so well, he was "reluctant to leave." He said: "Indeed, the treatment improved day by day. They did not mistreat us." Two other American prisoners of war named Floyd Le Stone and Marshall Lu Massey also said that they received "the best treatment possible." Stone said: "We often went swimming in the pool. It was a very good and clean place."

The prisoners of war were very healthy because they received good treatment in the prisoner of war camps. Even United Press reporter Hanson, who specializes in fabricating lies about the Korean-Chinese side's "mistreatment" of prisoners of war, had to admit on the 9th that the repatriated "Americans were in high spirits and looked very healthy."

An Associated Press report on the 7th also revealed that prisoners of war could engage in various religious activities in our prisoner of war camps. British prisoner of war Patrick Leighton, a soldier of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, told reporters: "If anyone wants to go to church, he can go freely." He said: "The Chinese abide by their guarantee not to interfere with religious ceremonies." This Catholic soldier said: The prisoner of war camp not only did not prohibit prisoners of war from organizing and participating in religious ceremonies but also provided them with various conveniences. The prisoners of war could worship and had their own accordion player to accompany them.

Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: TASS, Canberra, August 8th: The "Sydney Morning Herald," in reporting the news of the release of a group of "United Nations forces" prisoners of war by the Korean-Chinese side, wrote: Many of the released prisoners of war, including soldiers of the British Commonwealth, were tanned and looked very healthy. The doctor who examined the prisoners of war said: "The health of these people is very good, which proves that they have received adequate care and medical treatment."

The newspaper said: Most of the prisoners of war told reporters that sports meets were often held in the prisoner of war camps. A British prisoner of war took out a stack of brightly colored programs for the prisoner of war camp "Olympic Games" to show to others.

    朝中方面和对方八月九日继续遣返战俘
    归来的志愿军被俘人员有大批伤残重病的
    英美籍战俘谈我方给予的人道待遇，美方遮盖不住真相
    【新华社开城九日电】八月九日我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百五十人，朝鲜籍战俘二百五十人，共四百人。在非朝鲜籍战俘中，包括美国籍一百十二人，英国籍二十一人，土耳其籍十三人，澳大利亚籍二人，加拿大籍和菲律宾籍各一人。对方遣返给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员二千二百七十二人，内有女被俘人员四百七十三人；中国人民志愿军被俘人员六百零一人，内有女被俘人员一人；共计二千八百七十三人。此外还有儿童二十三人随着母亲归来。
    按对方原来的通知，今天对方遣返给我方的被俘人员中没有伤病人员。但是，仅需用担架运送的女被俘人员就有三人。
    【新华社开城九日电】最初三天遣返回来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员中有不少残废、重伤和长期患着严重疾病的人。其中有些人是在停战协定签字后，临近遣返时被美方打伤的；有些人在今年四月即应遣返，却被美方毫无理由地拖延到现在。
    归来人员尚仁财的眼睛在美方战俘营中被瓦斯弹烧坏了，红肿不堪，不断流眼泪。他的胸腹疼痛，呼吸困难。他说，他们在离开济州岛第八战俘营的那一天——七月二十八日，向美方战俘营当局要求将被另外拘禁起来的王方、魏林等十几名中国人民志愿军被俘的军官予以释放和遣返。美方不仅不答应这项正义要求，反而向他们投掷毒瓦斯弹。结果，六百多名我方被俘人员中有五百名中了毒，其中二百名当场昏倒。尚仁财曾被两枚毒瓦斯弹打中。
    归来人员中还有好多重伤员，他们都是在去年十月一日为了升旗纪念国庆而被美军打伤的。腹部、胳膊、腿部三处负伤的马号丑，曾被美方作了四次试验性的开刀，结果伤势愈来愈严重，最后腿成了残废。他激愤地说：“美方不是给我们治伤，而是把我们当试验品。这就是美国的‘人道主义’。”
    归来人员说，他们在美方战俘营中每天只能吃到半生不熟的带皮大麦粒，没有油吃。他们住的帐篷里面地下透湿，只垫了一点稻草，人就睡在上面。白天，美军还不准他们把湿草拿到帐篷外面去晒一下。所以，许多我方被俘人员都患有浮肿、湿疹、疥疮、肠胃炎、气管炎、肺病等严重的病症。此外，还有许多我方被俘人员因遭到美方毒打，神经受了严重损伤，成了精神病患者。在最初三天遣返回来的朝中方面被俘人员中，精神病患者即达八十八人。 【新华社开城九日电】本社记者报道：八日遣返的我方被俘人员，也像过去几天被遣返的人们一样，戴着自制的军帽回来了。他们愤怒地扔掉了美方发给的破烂衣物，只珍贵地拿着联合红十字会南组我方代表赠给他们的香烟和罐头。
    他们下车后就对人说：我们已有三天三夜没喝到一口水了，有些人已经四十多小时没有睡觉了。两腿残废了的中国人民志愿军被俘人员蔡经铭说：“美国是不甘心让我们回祖国的。五月十八日，美国人还逼迫着要我们到台湾去，我们不去，他们就把我们打伤了。”另外还有五个我方被俘人员和他一起被打残废了。
    在八日归来的人员中，许多朝鲜人民军被俘人员下车后立即控诉美方在停战前后强迫扣留我方被俘人员的暴行。志愿军归来人员中有很多身患重病的，但美方却没有把他们列为伤病战俘。在美方一辆载着非伤病人员的卡车上，有一个病情严重的志愿军被俘人员已被颠得昏迷不醒，奄奄一息了，经过朝中红十字会急救站紧急抢救，这个归来人员才脱离险境。这个归来人员，在昏迷中还一直喊着：
    “坚决回祖国，坚决回祖国！”
     【新华社九日讯】奉命制造我方“虐待”战俘的谎话的美国通讯社，很难遮盖住真象，不能不从它们的消息中透露出一些被遣返的美英战俘们不断谈论着朝中方面给他们以人道主义待遇的事实。
     合众社记者潘顿七日承认：三个被遣返的美国战俘对他说，他们受到相当好的待遇。其中一个二十三岁的美国士兵说：因为朝中方面对待他很好，他“舍不得走”。他说：“的确，待遇一天一天地改善。他们并没有虐待过我们。”另外名叫弗洛伊德·勒·斯通和马歇尔·鲁·麦赛的两个美军战俘也说，他们受到的待遇是“可能得到的最好的待遇”。斯通谈到：“我们常常到游泳池游泳。那是一个很好、很清洁的地方。”
    战俘们由于在战俘营受到良好待遇，身体都很健康。甚至专门制造所谓朝中方面“虐待”战俘的谎话的合众社记者韩森九日也不得不承认：被遣返的“美国人精神很愉快，并且看来都很健康”。
    美联社七日消息还透露，战俘们在我方战俘营中可以进行各种宗教上的活动。英国战俘、原皇家诺森伯兰联队的士兵帕特里克·莱顿对记者们说：“假若任何人要到教堂去，他可以随便去。”他说：“中国人遵守他们所提出的不干涉宗教仪式的保证。”这个信仰天主教的士兵说：战俘营不但不禁止战俘们组织和参加宗教仪式，并且还给他们以各种便利。战俘们可以作礼拜，并且有他们自己的手风琴手伴奏。
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社堪培拉八日讯：“悉尼先锋晨报”在报道朝中方面释放的一批“联合国军”战俘的消息时写道：被释放的战俘，包括英联邦的兵士在内，有许多人晒得黑黑的，显出很健康的样子。检查战俘的医生说：“这些人的健康情况非常良好，这证明他们受到充分的照顾和医药治疗。”
    该报说：多数战俘都告诉记者，战俘营中常常举行运动会。有一个英国战俘拿出一叠色彩鲜艳的战俘营“奥林匹克运动会”的节目单给别人看。
