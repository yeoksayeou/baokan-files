    In the East China region, approximately 22 million mu of cotton have already formed bolls, with some already bursting into floss; Zhejiang and Shandong provinces have already begun harvesting early cotton. It is expected that mid-season cotton and improved cotton varieties in various regions will begin picking around late August or early September. Except for a few areas affected by drought, floods, and wind damage, cotton in general areas is growing better than last year. In Jiading and Baoshan counties of Jiangsu Province, the more than 430,000 mu of cotton, based on the current situation, is estimated to yield about 20% more per mu than last year, with the best yielding over 200 jin per mu.

    This year, farmers in various cotton-producing areas of East China have made great efforts over the past few months to strive for a bumper cotton harvest in order to support the country's economic construction with the good cotton needed by the cotton textile industry. When the cotton was sown, there was generally insufficient rainfall, so farmers in some areas watered the fields to sow the seeds; after the cotton seedlings emerged, they promptly thinned, transplanted, and protected the seedlings. Although various insect pests occurred in many cotton-growing areas, the damage to cotton seedlings was greatly reduced due to the timely use of pesticides and manual prevention and control. At the same time, farmers in various places attached great importance to increasing the yield per unit area of cotton, and the area of densely planted cotton fields increased compared to last year. Improved cotton generally has about 3,000 plants per mu. At present, the topdressing and weeding work in cotton fields in various places has ended, and farmers are continuing to control insects, prune cotton, remove superfluous buds, and actively strive for a bumper cotton harvest.

    In the Central-South region, the cotton plants in the more than 20.09 million mu of cotton fields are generally one chi eight cun to two chi five cun tall. The cotton in Jingzhou Special District of Hubei Province, Xinxiang, Puyang, and Luoyang Special Districts of Henan Province, northern Jiangxi Province, and northern Hunan Province are mostly characterized by thick branches, lush leaves, and abundant cotton bolls. The earlier planted cotton has already produced 14 or 15 bolls per plant and will burst into floss and be ready for picking in early and mid-September. The early-maturing cotton varieties such as "Soviet 3132" and "Yishu Hong" planted in some areas this year are bursting into bolls and producing floss, and new cotton can be harvested in late August. According to estimates by relevant departments of the Central-South Administrative Committee: if there are no unexpected disasters, the total cotton production in the region is expected to increase by more than 10% compared to last year.

    In order to strive for a bumper cotton harvest, farmers in cotton-producing areas of Central-South China have mostly adopted high-quality cotton seeds this year and appropriately expanded the area of dense planting. The vast majority of cotton fields in Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Henan provinces have planted improved varieties such as "Dai Zi Cotton," "Si Zi Cotton," "De Zi Cotton," and "Si Zi Er Bi Cotton," with an average of more than 2,800 plants per mu, an increase of more than 300 plants compared to last year. The number of cotton fields carrying out cotton plant pruning work has also greatly increased compared to last year. Since sowing, farmers in cotton-growing areas have successively fought against drought and insect pests, ensuring the good growth of cotton.

    At present, farmers in cotton-growing areas are continuing to work intensively on insect control, topdressing, rational cotton pruning, boll protection, weeding, and draining accumulated water from low-lying cotton fields.

    华东中南各地农民大力争取棉花丰收
    华东区二千二百万亩左右的棉花已结铃，部分已经吐絮；浙江、山东两省并已开始采摘早棉。预计各地的中棉、改良棉将分别从八月下旬或九月上旬起开始拾花。除个别地区遭受旱、涝、风等灾害外，一般地区棉花都比去年长得好。江苏省嘉定、宝山两县的四十三万多亩棉花，据目前情况来看，估计每亩可比去年增产两成左右，最好的每亩产量可达二百斤以上。
    今年华东各产棉区农民为着支援国家经济建设中棉纺工业需要的良好用棉，几个月来已为争取棉花丰收作了很大的努力。当棉花播种时，一般雨水不足，有些地区的农民便浇水点种；棉苗出土后，又及时地间苗、移苗、保苗。虽然不少棉区发生了各种虫害，但由于适时地使用药械和用人工防治捕打，棉苗受害程度大大减轻。同时，各地农民都很重视提高棉花的单位面积产量，实行密植的棉田比去年增多，改良棉每亩棉株一般都在三千株左右。目前，各地棉田的追肥和除草工作已经结束，农民们正继续除虫、修棉、去赘芽，积极争取棉花丰收。
    中南区二千零九十多万亩棉田的棉株，一般都已长到一尺八寸到二尺五寸多高。湖北省荆州专区、河南省新乡、濮阳、洛阳等专区、江西省北部地区、湖南省北部地区的棉花，大部枝粗叶壮，棉桃累累。种植较早的棉花每株已结桃十四五个，九月上中旬即可吐絮、摘花。部分地区今年种植的“苏联三一三二号”和“一树红”等早熟棉花正在裂桃吐絮，八月下旬即可采摘新棉。据中南行政委员会有关部门估计：如无意外灾害，全区棉花可望比去年增产一成以上。
    为了争取棉花丰收，中南各产棉区农民今年大都采用了优良棉种，并适当扩大了密植面积。江西、湖南、湖北、河南等省绝大多数棉田都分别种植了“岱字棉”、“斯字棉”、“德字棉”和“斯字二比棉”等优良品种，平均每亩种植二千八百多株，比去年增加三百株以上。各地棉田进行棉株整枝工作的也比去年大大增加。从播种以来，棉区农民并先后和干旱、虫害斗争，保证了棉花的良好生长。
    目前，棉区农民正在继续紧张地除虫、施追肥、合理修棉、保桃除草和排除低湿棉田内的积水。          （新华社）
