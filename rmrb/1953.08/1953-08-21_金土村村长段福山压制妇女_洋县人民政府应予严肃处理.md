    Jintu Village Chief Duan Fushan Suppresses Women
    Yangxian People's Government Should Seriously Handle This
    Reader Zhang Fengyu writes: Duan Fushan, the village chief of Jintu Village, Shifo Township, Fifth District, Yangxian County, Shaanxi Province, has consistently looked down on women. If you have attended mass meetings in Jintu Village or visited the village's elementary school, you would find it strange why women do not participate in meetings or study at all. The following facts can answer this question.
    In March of this year, Wu Cuixian was beaten and scolded by her husband (a person under control) and went crying to Village Chief Duan Fushan. Duan Fushan became furious and reprimanded her. When Wu Cuixian made a few appeals, he brutally ordered her to be locked up in the cattle pen. Since then, Wu Cuixian has been constantly subjected to her husband's sarcasm and oppression. On another occasion, when Feng Xiulian's wife made a few complaints about the village affairs during a casual conversation, Duan Fushan, upon learning of this, convened a women's meeting to criticize her and even beat her up. Last year, when Wang Xiuan's wife and several other women said something wrong while repairing the road, Duan Fushan had others severely beat Wang Xiuan's wife. These incidents greatly threatened the women. Some women said privately: When women go to meetings, if something is slightly wrong, it is either a struggle session or being locked in the cattle pen; it's better not to go in the future.
    Duan Fushan also frequently satirizes and attacks female cadres. Sun Fuzhen (family member of a serviceman), a female cadre in the village, has always been active in her work and has been elected as a model twice. Because she held many positions and had no labor force at home, which affected production, she asked Duan Fushan to reduce some of her work. Duan Fushan became very unhappy and developed a prejudice against her. In June of this year, when her husband took leave to return home, she accompanied her husband to visit relatives twice and did not attend the meeting. Her husband returned to the army on June 20th, and Duan Fushan convened a village-wide mass meeting on the evening of the 24th, saying that Sun Fuzhen did not attend the meeting and mobilized everyone to criticize her. After being attacked, Sun Fuzhen was ill for nearly a month.
    Duan Fushan's behavior of stifling women's political enthusiasm is very wrong. It is suggested that the Yangxian People's Government seriously handle this matter.

    金土村村长段福山压制妇女
    洋县人民政府应予严肃处理
    读者张凤钰来信：陕西省洋县五区石佛乡金土村村长段福山，一贯轻视妇女。如果你参加过金土村的群众大会，或者去参观一下民校，你会感到奇怪，为什么妇女全不参加开会和学习呢？下面的事实就可以回答这个问题。
    今年三月，吴翠仙被丈夫（被管制分子）打骂，哭着去找村长段福山。段福山竟大发脾气，对她训斥一番。吴翠仙申诉了几句，他就蛮横地叫人把她关进牛圈里。后来吴翠仙就一直受着丈夫的讽刺和压迫。还有一次，冯秀连的女人在闲谈时对村里的事发了几句牢骚，段福山知道了，就召开妇女大会斗争她，还把她打了一顿。去年王秀安的女人和其他几个妇女在修路时说错了一句话，段福山就让别人将王秀安的女人狠狠地打了一顿。这些事情对妇女们的威胁很大。有些妇女背地说：妇女去开会，一点不对，不是开会斗争，就是关牛圈；以后还是不去好。
    段福山对妇女干部也是动不动就讽刺打击。该村妇女干部孙福珍（军属）。一贯工作积极，曾当选过两次模范。她因兼职很多，家里又没有劳动力，影响了生产，就向段福山提出要求减轻些工作。段福山就大不高兴，对她抱了成见。今年六月，她爱人请假回家时，她有两次陪爱人看亲戚而没有去开会。她爱人在六月二十日回部队去了，段福山就在二十四日晚上召开全村群众大会，说孙福珍不参加会议，发动大家斗争她。孙福珍受了打击后，病了将近一月。
    段福山这种扼杀妇女政治积极性的行为，是非常错误的。建议洋县人民政府对此进行严肃处理。
