　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 20th: TASS Moscow, August 20th—Soviet newspapers on the 20th published the following government announcement regarding the Soviet hydrogen bomb test:

　　Recently, the Soviet Union conducted an explosion test of a certain type of hydrogen bomb. The intense thermonuclear reaction of the hydrogen bomb caused a very violent explosion. The test proved that the power of the hydrogen bomb is many times greater than that of the atomic bomb.

　　It is known that the Soviet Union has possessed atomic weapons for several years and has conducted necessary tests of such weapons. As can be seen from the speech delivered by G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on August 8 this year, the Soviet Union has also mastered the secret of hydrogen bomb production.

　　This statement by the Soviet government has aroused many comments abroad. Some foreign groups, who formerly relied on the American atomic bomb monopoly and later on the American hydrogen bomb monopoly as the basis of their policies, are attempting to intimidate the people with the fact that the Soviet Union has mastered the secret of hydrogen weapons production, thereby causing panic in order to intensify the arms race.

　　The Soviet government believes it must declare that, as before, this panic is completely unfounded.

　　Based on the Soviet Union's unwavering policy of consolidating peace and ensuring the security of all nations, the Soviet government has repeatedly proposed to other national governments that they advocate substantial arms reductions, a ban on the use of atomic weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction, and the establishment of strict international oversight within the United Nations to monitor the implementation of the ban.

　　The Soviet government still adheres to this position.

    苏联政府发表关于氢弹试验公告
    重申大量裁减军备禁用原子武器的主张
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：苏联报纸二十日刊载关于苏联氢弹试验的政府公告如下：
    最近，苏联作了一种类型的氢弹的爆炸试验。氢弹的强烈的热核子反应引起了非常猛烈的爆炸。试验证明，氢弹的威力比原子弹的威力强大许多倍。
    大家知道，苏联拥有原子武器已经有几年了，并曾作过这种武器的必要的试验。从苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫今年八月八日在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上发表的演说中可以知道，苏联也掌握了氢弹生产的秘密。
    苏联政府的这一声明在国外引起了许多评论。若干从前以美国的原子弹垄断、后来又以美国的氢弹垄断作为他们的政策的依靠的外国集团，企图以苏联已掌握氢武器生产秘密这一事实来恫吓人民，从而引起惊慌，以便加紧进行军备竞赛。
    苏联政府认为必须声明：和从前一样，这种惊慌是毫无根据的。
    根据苏联的巩固和平和各国人民安全的不变的政策，苏联政府曾不止一次地向其他国家政府提出建议，主张大量裁减军备、禁止使用原子武器及其他种类的大规模毁灭性的武器，并在联合国范围内建立严格的国际监督，监督禁令的实施。
    苏联政府现在还是坚持这种立场。
