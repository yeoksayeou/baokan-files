    Very Chaotic Warehouse Management at the Fengtai Materials Factory of the Beijing Railway Administration
    Reader Song Zhi writes: I am writing to you with anger to reflect the chaotic situation in the warehouse management of the Fengtai Materials Factory of the Beijing Railway Administration. Various useful tools and equipment are scattered everywhere within the factory, exposed to the elements. A dozen or so electric switch machines, worth two to three hundred million yuan, have been left unattended and are covered in dust, with severely rusted parts, making them unusable without major repairs. In the "scrap heap," it is easy to find brand new, valuable materials. Workers say, "The materials factory is paved with gold." This is absolutely true!
    At the end of last year, the factory's electrical materials warehouse conducted a so-called "inventory count," but in reality, it was just a few people sitting in a room counting cards, counting one card as checking one item. These people counted one or two thousand cards a day, and the leadership considered this exceeding the quota. As a result, the materials and the accounts were completely unrelated. Now, although the warehouse has conducted another "inventory," the materials still do not match the accounts. The inventory materials are either too much or too little, or the specifications are incorrect, or the quality is substandard. Many similar materials should be stored centrally for supply, but the electrical materials warehouse stores them in multiple locations; sometimes, thirty or forty different specifications of materials are recorded on one account; some accounts record radios, but in reality, they are transceivers. Many valuable equipment are covered with dust and difficult to distinguish between new and old because they have not been cleaned and organized for a long time; some are therefore treated as scrap.
    Under these circumstances, the material supply work is, of course, very poorly done. When a production unit wants to requisition a material, the warehouse keeper says that there is none on the books, but the person requisitioning the material finds it in the warehouse themselves. When someone talked to the director of the electrical materials warehouse about these problems, he actually said, "I admit it's chaotic; but no one is taking anything home..." This understanding is extremely wrong and needs no refutation.
    The reason why the warehouse work of the Fengtai Materials Factory is so chaotic is precisely the result of the factory leaders' long-term neglect of this work. When small mistakes and chaos began to appear in the warehouse work, the factory leaders did not pay attention to them at all, and did not urge the warehouse work cadres to take effective measures to improve the work. As a result, the work became more and more chaotic, and finally became a "complete mess." I suggest that the Beijing Railway Administration quickly conduct a thorough inspection of the warehouse work of the Fengtai Materials Factory to end this chaotic situation.

### 北京铁路管理局丰台材料厂仓库保管工作非常混乱

    北京铁路管理局丰台材料厂仓库保管工作非常混乱
    读者宋之来信：我以愤怒的心情向你们反映北京铁路管理局丰台材料厂仓库保管工作中的混乱情况。该厂厂内到处散置着各种有用的工具和器材，任凭日晒雨淋。价值两三亿元的十几台电气转辙机都因为放着没人管而积满尘土，机件锈蚀得很厉害，不经过大修理根本不能使用。在“废料堆”里，很容易找出全新的贵重的材料。工人们说：材料厂遍地是黄金。真一点不假！
    去年年底，该厂电料库曾作过一次所谓“盘存点库”工作，但实际上只是由几个人坐在屋里清点卡片，数一张卡片就算检查了一笔物资。这些人一天数一两千张卡片，领导方面就认为这是超额完成任务。而结果料是料，账是账，各不相干。现在，该库虽然又作过“清点”工作，但仍然是料账不符。库存材料不是多就是少，或者是规格不合，质量不符。有不少同类器材，按理应集中存放，以便供应，但电料库却分存多处；有时三、四十种不同规格的材料记在一个账上；有的账上记的是收音机，实际上却是收发报机。不少贵重器材由于长期无人清理整顿，尘土满布，新旧难分；有的因此就被当作废品处理了。
    在这种情况下，器材供应工作当然就做得很是不好。生产单位要领用一种材料，管库的人说账上没有，但领料人自己却在库里找到了。有人向电料库主任谈起这些问题，他竟说：“乱，我是承认的；但谁也没往自己家里拿东西呀……。”用不着驳斥，这种认识是极端错误的。
    丰台材料厂仓库工作所以形成如此混乱的现象，正是材料厂领导同志长期不重视这个工作的结果。当仓库工作开始出现小错、小乱时，该厂领导同志根本不加注意，没有督促仓库工作干部采取有效办法来改进工作，结果工作愈来愈乱，终于成为“一团糟”。我建议北京铁路管理局赶快对丰台材料厂的仓库工作作彻底检查，结束这种混乱情况。
