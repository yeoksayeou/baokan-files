    Kaesong Frontline During the Armistice
    Yan Wu, Lin Wei

    We stayed on the Kaesong front for ten days or so around the time of the armistice. We saw how the Korean and Chinese People's forces faithfully and thoroughly implemented the armistice agreement.

    On the afternoon of July 27th, the "Demilitarized Zone Indication Map" was added to the side of the operational map on the wall of the front headquarters. Commanders at all levels were busy synchronizing their watches on the phone, and constantly sending special personnel to the positions to check on the progress of the ceasefire preparations. Their slogan was: "Ensure timely implementation of the agreement." Before 10:00 PM, the command organizations at all levels on the entire front issued orders level by level: "Cease fire!" "Stop shooting!"

    At 10:30 PM, half an hour after the ceasefire, when we arrived at the "Red Hill" position, 25 miles southeast of Kaesong, from the headquarters, loudspeakers were broadcasting songs such as "People of the World are of One Heart." We saw engineers accelerating the repair of the Shachuan River Bridge behind the position under the moonlight. Explosives, mines, and other heavy materials were also being moved backwards by rubber boats ahead of time. Two or three hours later, the bridge was repaired; trucks and horse-drawn carts were busy loading and transporting equipment and materials; staff officers were inspecting the preparations for leveling fortifications, checking the explosives used to destroy fortifications, gathering mine-sweeping teams and barbed wire removal teams, and assigning engineers to various locations to level fortifications and remove dangerous objects.

    On the 28th - the morning of the day after the armistice, the sound of exploding fortifications resounded on the position. Soldiers were filling in the communication trenches. The engineers sweeping mines and removing barbed wire were clearing dangerous objects and barbed wire in the forefront, two or three hundred meters from the enemy. They also constantly shouted to the enemy soldiers, telling them the righteousness of our side's defense of peace and resistance to aggression, and the spirit of strictly implementing the armistice agreement, urging them to also seriously level fortifications and abide by the agreement.

    On the 28th, our tank units completely withdrew. When the sun set on the 29th, our various artillery units, anti-tank artillery teams, anti-aircraft artillery units, and heavy machine gun units also withdrew. By the 30th, the last day of withdrawal from the demilitarized zone, at 6:30 PM, the large groups of infantry also marched with vigorous steps to the north of the northern edge of the demilitarized zone. At exactly 10:00 PM, the last soldier of our final guard unit also stepped out of the demilitarized zone.

    Now, our soldiers are rebuilding their "position homes" on new positions north of the northern edge of the demilitarized zone.

    The great peacekeepers and heroes of the Fatherland Liberation War - the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army were as brave as tigers when fighting against aggression and defending peace; and now, they have completely consciously become models for implementing all the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement. However, the heroic Korean and Chinese People's forces have not lost their vigilance because of the Korean armistice, as one soldier said: "If anyone wants to invade us again in the future, we will strike them even harder and make them suffer even more慘重的 defeat!"

    停战在开城前线
    阎吾  林韦
    停战前后，我们曾在开城前线逗留十来天。我们看到了朝中人民部队忠诚而彻底地执行停战协定的情形。
    七月二十七日下午，前线指挥部墙上的作战地图的边上增加了“非军事区标示图”。各级指挥员们忙着在电话里对表，并不断派出专人到各阵地上去检查停火准备工作进行的情况。他们的口号是：“保证按时执行协定”。下午十时前，整个前线的各级指挥机关便逐级下达命令：“停火！”“停止射击！”
    下午十点半，停火后半小时，我们从指挥部到达开城东南二十五里的“红山包”阵地时，扩音器正放送着“全世界人民心一条”等歌曲。我们看到工兵们在月光下正在加速修理阵地背后的砂川河大桥。炸药、地雷和其他笨重物资，也在提前用橡皮船向后搬运。两三个小时以后，大桥修好了；卡车、马车便忙碌地装运器材物资；参谋人员正在检查平毁工事的准备工作，检查炸毁工事用的炸药，调集探雷队和铁丝网扫除队以及分配工兵到各处进行平毁工事和清除危险物的工作。
    二十八日——停战次日的清晨，爆破工事的声音就在阵地上轰轰地响起来了。战士们正在把交通壕填平。扫雷和扫除铁丝网的工兵们，在接敌二、三百公尺的最前沿进行着清除危险物和铁丝网的工作。他们还不断地向敌方士兵喊话，告诉他们我方保卫和平、反抗侵略的正义性和严格执行停战协定的精神，要他们也认真平毁工事，遵守协定。
    二十八日，我军坦克部队完全后撤了。二十九日太阳落山的时候，我军各种炮兵部队、反坦克炮队、高射炮部队、重机枪部队也统统撤下来了。到三十日，撤离非军事区的最后一日下午六点半，大队步兵也踏着健壮的步伐提前往非军事区北缘以北走去。下午十点正，我军最后警戒部队的最后一个战士也跨出了非军事区。
    现在，我军战士们正在非军事区北缘以北新的阵地上重建他们的“阵地之家”。
    伟大的和平保卫者和卫国战争中的英雄——中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军战士们为反抗侵略、保卫和平而战斗时，勇如猛虎；而现在，他们又完全自觉地成为执行朝鲜停战协定中一切条款的模范。但是，英雄的朝中人民部队并没有因为朝鲜的停战而丧失警惕，正如一个战士说：“如果以后谁还想要再来侵犯我们，我们就要把他打击得更重，叫他们遭受到更加惨重的失败！”
