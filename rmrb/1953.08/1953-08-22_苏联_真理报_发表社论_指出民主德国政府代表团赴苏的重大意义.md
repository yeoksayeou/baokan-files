Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 20th: TASS reports that "Pravda" published an editorial entitled "Concerning the Arrival of the Delegation from the German Democratic Republic."

The editorial stated: The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic will soon arrive in Moscow at the invitation of the Soviet government to discuss certain important issues related to the development of relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, as well as pressing matters concerning the German question as a whole. The editorial then pointed out that the Soviet government's note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on August 15th explained the Soviet Union's attitude towards the German question and put forward the Soviet Union's proposals. In addressing the German question, the Soviet Union proceeds from the following premise: this pressing issue, which is of paramount importance to international peace and security, must be resolved and can be resolved. The Western countries' policy of dragging Germany into an aggressive bloc and restoring aggressive militarist Germany hinders the resolution of this issue. The policy pursued by the United States, Britain, and France of permanently dividing Germany has indefinitely delayed the study of the peace treaty issue and has consistently prevented the resolution of the issue of organizing an all-German government.

The editorial stated: Considering the legitimate national interests of the German people and the aspirations of all peace-loving people, the Soviet government proposed that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France convene a peace conference with the participation of relevant countries within six months to consider a peace treaty with Germany, and also proposed the establishment of a provisional all-German government, while also suggesting reducing Germany's financial and economic obligations arising from the consequences of the Great War.

The editorial stated: Since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have been continuously developing and consolidating.

The Soviet government, in accordance with the agreement between the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic, has provided the German people with comprehensive assistance whenever needed.

Economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic is developing smoothly. This year, trade between the two countries has greatly increased compared to 1952. It exceeds the amount stipulated for this year in the long-term agreement of 1951. Scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries is strengthening, and the scale of cultural relations is also expanding.

The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic are thus consolidating year by year. The Soviet Union has consistently helped and supported the German Democratic Republic—the bulwark of the struggle for a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany.

The editorial concluded: The Soviet public is deeply convinced that the arrival of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic will enable the two countries to discuss the German question in detail and believes that this will be an important new stage in the further development of the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.

    苏联“真理报”发表社论
    指出民主德国政府代表团赴苏的重大意义
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：“真理报”以“关于德意志民主共和国代表团的到来”为题发表社论。
    社论说：德意志民主共和国政府代表团即将应苏联政府的邀请到达莫斯科，来讨论有关发展苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的关系的某些重要问题以及关于整个德国问题的迫切事项。社论接着指出，苏联政府在八月十五日致美国、英国和法国政府的照会，说明了苏联对于德国问题的态度，并提出了苏联的各项建议。在着手解决德国问题时，苏联是从下列前提出发的：这个对于国际和平与安全具有头等重要性的迫切问题，是必须解决而且可以解决的。西方国家把德国拖入一个侵略集团的政策和恢复侵略性的军国主义德国的政策，阻挠了这个问题的解决。美国、英国和法国政府所奉行的使德国永远分裂的政策，使和约问题的研究无限期地拖延了下来，并使组织全德政府的问题老是得不到解决。
    社论说：苏联政府考虑到德国人民的合法的民族利益和全体爱好和平的人民的愿望，建议美国、英国和法国政府在六个月以内召开一个由有关各国参加的和平会议，考虑对德和约，并建议成立全德临时政府，同时建议减轻德国由于大战结果而负担的财政与经济义务。
    社论说：自从德意志民主共和国建立以来，苏联和德意志民主共和国的友好的关系就一直在不断发展和巩固。
    苏联政府根据苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府之间的协议，每当需要时，就给予德国人民以全面的帮助。
    苏联和德意志民主共和国的经济合作正在顺利地发展。今年，两国间的贸易已比一九五二年大大增加了。它超过了一九五一年长期协定为今年规定的数量。两国的科学和技术合作正在加强，文化关系的规模也正在扩大。
    苏联和德意志民主共和国的友好关系正是这样一年比一年巩固。苏联始终不渝地帮助和支持德意志民主共和国——争取统一、和平和民主的德国的斗争的堡垒。
    社论最后说：苏联公众深信德意志民主共和国政府代表团的到来，使两国能够详细地讨论德国问题，并相信这将是进一步发展苏联和德意志民主共和国的友好关系的一个重要的新阶段。
