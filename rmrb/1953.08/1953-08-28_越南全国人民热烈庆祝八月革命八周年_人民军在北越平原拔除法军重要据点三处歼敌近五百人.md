Xinhua News Agency, 27th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 25th, Vietnam enthusiastically celebrated the eighth anniversary of the August Revolution in the past few days. Vietnamese newspapers and radio stations published special issues or broadcast special programs to commemorate this festival.

    The Vietnamese newspaper "Cuu Quoc" ("National Salvation") published an editorial entitled "Commemorating the August Revolution, Let Us Establish the Concept of Long-Term and Self-Reliant Armed Resistance." The editorial pointed out that after the victory of the August Revolution, the Vietnamese people heroically resisted the re-aggression of the French colonialists. The course of action determined by President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese government at the beginning of the war of resistance has now proven to be very wise. Looking back at the battles of the past seven years, we can see that our people have gained greater and greater victories and achieved more glorious progress, while the enemy has become increasingly weakened.

    The editorial said: In order to commemorate this year's August Revolution, we must maintain the high fighting spirit of the general uprising, enhance the extensive unity of the people of the whole country, establish the concept of long-term and self-reliant resistance, and strive to complete the following tasks: 1. Eliminate the enemy's active forces; 2. Crush the enemy's policy of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese"; 3. Replenish our own strength.

    The editorial finally called on all Vietnamese people to fully support and participate in the movement to fully mobilize the peasant masses, so as to promote the production movement and armed resistance.

    Xinhua News Agency, 27th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 26th: On August 11th and 15th, the Vietnamese People's Army eliminated three important French military strongholds in the North Vietnamese plains, annihilating nearly 500 enemy soldiers. These three strongholds are: Tien Tien, seven kilometers north of Hai Duong city; Van Tri, north of Hung Yen city; and Tu Ky, five kilometers northeast of Ninh Giang city in Hai Duong province.

    The People's Army killed more than 400 enemy soldiers, captured another 80, and seized many weapons and military supplies.

    The battle to eliminate the Van Tri stronghold in Hung Yen province was very fierce. The People's Army annihilated two enemy companies there and destroyed two enemy heavy artillery pieces.

    社论最后号召全越南人民全力支持和参加全面发动农民群众的运动，以便推进生产运动和武装抗战。
    【新华社二十七日讯】越南通讯社二十六日讯：八月十一日和十五日，越南人民军在北越平原拔除法军重要据点三处，歼灭敌军近五百人。这三个据点是：海阳省会以北七公里的仙仙、兴安省会以北的文治和海阳省宁江城东北五公里处的四其。
    人民军一共打死敌军四百多人，另外俘掳八十人，缴获许多武器和军事供应品。
