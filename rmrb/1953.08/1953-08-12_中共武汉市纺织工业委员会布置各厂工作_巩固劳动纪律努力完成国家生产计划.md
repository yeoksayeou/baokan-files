The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Textile Industry convened an enlarged meeting on July 17th to summarize the ideological education work of strengthening labor discipline in the previous stage and to deploy the tasks for the next stage to each factory.

Currently, the ideological education work of strengthening labor discipline in various textile factories in the city is mostly transitioning to the stage of establishing systems related to consolidating labor discipline, and the Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill has already begun to establish a responsibility system. Comrade Liu Zhenbang, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CCP Textile Industry, emphasized in his summary that to consolidate conscious labor discipline, it is necessary to continue to carry out ideological education in depth, conscientiously implement the established systems, effectively strengthen labor protection and life guidance work, rapidly complete workshop cooling equipment, ensure that workers have sufficient sleep time, strictly control amateur activity time, and solve some practical problems for workers.

Comrade Liu Zhenbang pointed out in his deployment of future work that it is necessary to establish a responsibility system on the basis of consolidating labor discipline education, improve quality, ensure output, and complete the national production plan. At present, for each textile factory, all work should focus on improving quality, and the operation plan with improving quality as the core should be used as the central link running through everything. Through this link, the establishment of the responsibility system, the promotion of advanced work methods, the consolidation of labor discipline, the investigation and determination of key pilot projects, and the launch of labor competitions will be driven and unified. Comrade Liu Zhenbang also made the following specific arrangements:

(1) Regarding the establishment of a responsibility system: The establishment of the responsibility system must be unified with ensuring the completion of the production plan, especially with solving the key problems in current production. The key problem in the current textile production is the low quality of products, so it is necessary to seriously establish a necessary and feasible responsibility system to solve the problem of low product quality. The steps to establish the responsibility system can be roughly divided into three steps: The first step is to summarize the work, and the leadership should compile an operation plan (the operation plan should propose measures, requirements, and work progress based on the main problems in current production); the second step is to mobilize the masses to discuss the operation plan; the third step is to clarify responsibilities and establish a necessary and feasible responsibility system according to the requirements of the operation plan.

(2) Regarding the promotion of advanced work methods: It is necessary to adhere to the promotion and consolidation of the Hao Jianxiu work method. The key to doing this work well lies in strengthening leadership. At the same time, we should also learn from the experience of the Wuchang No. 1 Cotton Mill's North Branch spinning room in deeply promoting the Hao Jianxiu work method, such as assigning special personnel in charge, ensuring the time for promotion, formulating technical education and ideological education plans, and focusing on solving different key problems in different stages. The 1953 maintenance work method should be actively promoted under the principle of "from wiping to leveling, batch promotion, parallel approach, and steady progress." The basic requirements are: improve quality, ensure efficiency, coordinate operation, and reduce end breaks. The current maintenance work should pay special attention to coordinating operation, and solve practical problems such as affecting the quality of yarn and cloth from the maintenance work aspect. The 1951 weaving work method, the pre-spinning work method, etc., should also continue to be seriously promoted.

(3) It is necessary to combine the current central work, and mobilize the masses to launch labor competitions with a plan, steps, and goals. The labor competition should take completing the production plan on the basis of improving quality as the main goal, take the operation plan as the central content, and take group challenges and red flag patrols as the basic methods. The specific contents of the competition may include four items: work method, output, return of flowers, and attendance. In order to enable the competition to be carried out regularly and persistently, on the one hand, the leadership of each factory must strengthen the leadership of the labor competition and assign special personnel to manage it; on the other hand, it must strengthen inspection and award prizes regularly. In terms of inspection methods: the inspection of output, return of flowers, and attendance relies on statistical records, while the inspection of the implementation of the work method adopts a combination of mass self-inspection, mutual inspection, and leadership spot checks. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen statistical records, publish the inspection results in a timely manner, summarize monthly, and award prizes quarterly. Each factory should clarify the purpose and requirements of the competition, and focus on overcoming the bias of being restrained and not daring to boldly carry out labor competitions.

Comrade Liu Zhenbang also put forward requirements and opinions on the investigation and determination of key pilot projects and the issue of Party leadership.

At the meeting, Comrade Li Erzhong, First Deputy Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CCP, made important instructions. He first affirmed the practice of establishing a responsibility system in the textile system based on the operation plan and focusing on improving quality. Then, he gave detailed instructions on the issue of Party leadership. He said: The Party's leadership power should be concentrated on learning management and learning technology, and the most elite forces should be concentrated on the weak links and important workshops that affect quality, and mobilize the masses to solve existing problems; at the same time, we must pay close attention to discovering and cultivating advanced experience and advanced ideas among management personnel and technical personnel, commend the advanced, and drive the general.

### 中共武汉市纺织工业委员会布置各厂工作  巩固劳动纪律努力完成国家生产计划

    中共武汉市纺织工业委员会布置各厂工作
    巩固劳动纪律努力完成国家生产计划
    中共武汉市纺织工业委员会于七月十七日召开扩大会议，总结前一阶段加强劳动纪律的思想教育工作，布置各厂下一阶段的工作任务。
    目前，该市各纺织厂加强劳动纪律的思想教育工作，大多将转入建立有关巩固劳动纪律制度的阶段，武昌第一纱厂并已开始建立责任制。中共武汉市纺织工业委员会书记刘振邦同志在总结时着重指出：要巩固自觉的劳动纪律，必须继续深入进行思想教育，认真贯彻已建立的制度，切实有效地加强劳动保护和生活指导工作，迅速完成车间降温设备，保证工人有充足的睡眠时间，严格控制业余活动时间，为工人解决一些实际问题。
    刘振邦同志在布置今后工作中指出：必须在巩固劳动纪律教育的基础上，建立责任制，提高质量，保证产量，完成国家生产计划。目前各纺织厂，一切工作应以提高质量为中心，把提高质量为中心的作业计划作为贯穿一切的中心链条。通过这一链条，把建立责任制、推广先进工作法、巩固劳动纪律、查定重点试办与开展劳动竞赛等工作带动和统一起来。刘振邦同志并作了以下具体的布置：
    （一）关于建立责任制：建立责任制必须与保证完成生产计划，特别应与解决当前生产上的关键问题统一起来。当前纺织生产上的关键问题是产品质量不高，因此必须为解决产品质量不高的问题认真建立必要与可行的责任制。建立责任制的步骤，大致可分三步：第一步总结工作，领导上编制作业计划（作业计划应根据当前生产中的主要问题，提出措施、要求和作业进度）；第二步发动群众，讨论作业计划；第三步根据作业计划的要求，分清职责，建立必要与可行的责任制。
    （二）关于推广先进工作法：必须坚持郝建秀工作法的推广和巩固工作。做好这一工作，关键在于加强领导。同时，还应学习武昌第一纱厂北场细纱间在深入推广郝建秀工作法的工作中专人负责、保证推广的时间、制订技术教育与思想教育计划、在不同阶段中着重解决不同的重点问题等经验。一九五三保全工作法应在“由揩到平、分批推广、双管齐下、稳步前进”的方针下积极推广。基本要求是：提高质量，保证效率，配合运转，降低断头。保全工作当前应特别注意配合运转，从保全工作方面解决影响纱、布质量等实际问题。一九五一织布工作法、前纺工作法等也应继续认真推广。
    （三）必须结合当前中心工作，有计划、有步骤、有目标地发动群众开展劳动竞赛。劳动竞赛应以在提高质量的基础上完成生产计划为主要目标，以作业计划为中心内容，以小组挑战、红旗巡回为基本方式。竞赛的具体内容可包括工作法、产量、回花、出勤四项。为使竞赛能够经常地、持久地开展下去，各厂领导上一方面要加强对劳动竞赛的领导，专人掌握；一方面要加强检查，定期评奖。在检查方式上：产量、回花、出勤的检查，依靠统计记录，工作法执行情况的检查则采取群众自查、互查与领导抽查相结合的方式。为此，必须加强统计记录，及时公布检查结果，按月总结，按季评奖。各厂应明确竞赛的目的与要求，着重克服束手束脚、不敢大胆开展劳动竞赛的偏向。
    刘振邦同志对于查定重点试办工作及党的领导问题也分别提出了要求和意见。
    会上，中共武汉市委第一副书记李尔重同志作了重要指示。他首先肯定了纺织系统中建立责任制应以作业计划为依据，以改善质量为中心的做法。接着对党的领导问题作了详尽的指示。他说：党的领导力量应集中到学习管理、学习技术上去，应把最精锐的力量集中到影响质量的薄弱环节和重要车间中去，发动群众解决存在的问题；同时，要十分注意发现与培养管理人员与技术人员中的先进经验与先进思想，表扬先进，带动一般。
