Our Great Motherland
Xinjiang's famous granary—the fertile plains of the abundant Yili River, have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. People of all ethnic groups cultivate three million mu of farmland and orchards here. The grain here not only fully provides for the local people, but also has a large surplus for supply to other areas every year. This is the harvested wheat from the Turpan Weizi in Yining County. Uyghur men and women farmers are harvesting.

    新疆著名的粮仓——富饶的伊犁河畔的肥沃平原，今年获得空前的丰收。各族人民在这里耕种着三百万亩农田和果园。这里的粮食不但能充分供给本区人民食用，而且每年有大量的余粮供给外区。这是伊宁县吐鲁番圩孜丰收的小麦。维吾尔族的男女农民正在收割。
