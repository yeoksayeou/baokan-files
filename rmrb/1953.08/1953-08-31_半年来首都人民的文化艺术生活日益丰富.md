    The cultural and artistic life of the people of the capital is becoming increasingly rich. In the capital, huge colorful posters frequently appear along the broad streets and in front of major theaters and cinemas, announcing new dramas and films, powerfully attracting pedestrians. The number of new spoken dramas staged in the capital in the past six months has exceeded that of previous years. Dramas reflecting real life and struggle, such as "Forty Years of Aspiration," "Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits," "Between Husband and Wife," and "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," have aroused the enthusiastic love of the people of the capital. Last winter, the Northeast People's Art Theater's performance of the drama "Dawn Shines on Moscow" in Beijing continued for more than two months, yet still could not meet the demands of the people of the capital. Finally, the North China People's Drama Troupe and the Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission successively performed it for more than four months, with many people still buying tickets for each performance. The premiere of children's dramas such as "Little White Rabbit" and "The Peaches are Ripe" by the China Children's Theater Troupe is a new phenomenon in the cultural life of the people of the capital. On "June 1st" Children's Day, the troupe also staged the five-act drama "Comrade, and You Together," which portrays the excellent qualities of the Soviet youth generation. These three children's dramas were performed more than 50 times in more than two months, with almost all of the more than 40,000 audience members being children.

    Beijing opera and Ping opera, which are traditionally loved by the people of the capital, have also been very active in performances in the past six months. The Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera has adapted and reorganized many Beijing and Ping operas in the first half of this year. The beautiful folk tale "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" has been continuously staged in various theaters in the form of Beijing opera, Yue opera, and Qinqiang opera for 121 performances, with almost every performance being full. The adapted classical dance dramas "Yandang Mountain" and "Wild Boar Forest" and Beijing opera "Generals and Ministers Reconciled," and the opera "Luo Han Qian" have all been warmly praised by the audience. Famous Beijing opera actors Cheng Yanqiu, Li Shaochun, and Tan Fuying have all met with the audience on stage with their outstanding artistic talents. Almost every day, more than 20 theaters in the city stage Beijing opera, Ping opera, and folk art performances that audiences love. In the first half of this year, the total audience in various theaters reached more than 2.7 million people.

    At the open-air theater of the Working People's Cultural Palace and on the big stage of the Beijing Theater, the people of the capital have also continuously enjoyed the excellent performances of foreign and domestic art troupes. In the past six months, the Korean Railway Art Troupe visiting China, the Mongolian People's Republic Art Troupe, the Polish People's Republic Mazowsze Song and Dance Ensemble, and the Indian Art Delegation have come to the capital to perform; excellent domestic art troupes such as the Shanghai United Yue Opera Troupe, the Chongqing Acrobatic Troupe, the Northeast People's Art Theater Music and Dance Troupe, and the Shanxi Yuci Special District Jiaocheng People's Jin Opera Troupe have also performed in various theaters in the capital. These wonderful songs and dances with national styles, music, and folk arts have further enriched the cultural and artistic life of the people of the capital.

    Films, especially Soviet films with a high degree of ideological content, are universally loved by the people of the capital. In the past six months, a total of 60 films have been screened in the city, 56 of which were new films. In addition, Czechoslovak Republic and Hungarian People's Republic film weeks were also held. The audience in the city's 17 cinemas has reached more than 14.3 million in the past six months. People living in urban and suburban areas far from cinemas can also often see performances by dozens of mobile film teams. The Beijing Municipal People's Government is now building four new cinemas and theaters in the southern and northern cities where the working people live. After these new cinemas and theaters are completed, each performance can accommodate more than 3,300 people, which will further meet the cultural life needs of the working people in the capital.

    The artistic images in dramas and films have given the people of the capital great inspiration and education, and the excellent qualities of various advanced figures in films and dramas have become role models for people to learn from in production, work, and life. After watching the drama "Dawn Shines on Moscow," the workers of Qinghe Woolen Mill held a symposium. Many workers enthusiastically expressed: We must learn from Sanya, so that our products become more and more beautiful and stronger, to meet the needs of the people. The movers of the Beijing Transportation Company's trade union held a forum after watching the film "Gate No. 6." After the China Children's Theater Troupe performed the drama "Comrade, and You Together," many middle and primary school students spontaneously held symposiums and discussions. These viewers, who were moved and inspired, all expressed that they would learn from the outstanding characters in the films and dramas. (Xinhua News Agency)

    半年来首都人民的文化艺术生活日益丰富
    首都人民的文化艺术生活日益丰富。在首都，广阔街道的两旁和各大剧院影院门前，时常有巨幅的彩色招贴画出现，预告着新的戏剧和影片，有力的吸引着行人。半年来首都上演的新话剧超过以往几年。反映现实生活和斗争的“四十年的愿望”、
    “春华秋实”、“夫妻之间”、“小二黑结婚”等，引起首都人民的热烈爱好。去冬东北人民艺术剧院旅京公演的话剧“曙光照耀着莫斯科”，连续演出两个多月，仍不能满足首都人民的要求，最后又由华北人民话剧团和人民革命军事委员会总政治部文工团相继演出四个多月，每场买票的观众还是很多。中国少年儿童剧团的“小白兔”、“桃子熟了”等儿童剧的公演，更是首都人民文化生活中的新气象。在“六一”儿童节该剧团又上演了表现苏联青年一代优秀品质的“同志和你在一起”五幕话剧。以上三个儿童剧在两个多月中演出五十多场，观众四万多人中几乎都是少年儿童。
    为首都人民所传统嗜爱的京、评剧，半年来的演出也很活跃。中国戏曲研究院今年上半年改编和整理了许多京、评剧。优美的民间传说故事“梁山伯与祝英台”曾以京剧、越剧、秦腔三种形式在各剧院连续上演一百二十一场，每场几乎都座无虚席。改编后的古典舞蹈剧“雁荡山”、“野猪林”和京戏“将相和”、歌剧“罗汉钱”等，都受到观众的热烈赞扬。著名京剧演员程砚秋、李少春、谭富英等都以出色的艺术才能在舞台上和广大观众见面。全市二十多个剧院几乎每天都有观众喜爱的京戏、评剧和曲艺上演，今年上半年各剧院的观众共达二百七十万多人。
    在劳动人民文化宫的露天剧场和北京剧院等大舞台上，首都人民还不断地欣赏到外国和国内各地艺术团体的优秀表演。半年来先后有朝鲜访华铁道艺术团、蒙古人民共和国艺术团、波兰人民共和国玛佐夫舍歌舞团、印度艺术代表团等来首都表演；国内各地优秀的艺术团体如上海联合越剧团、重庆杂技团、东北人民艺术剧院音乐舞蹈团、山西榆次专区交城人民晋剧团等也在首都各剧院演出。这些精彩的具有民族风格的歌舞音乐和民间技艺，更加丰富了首都人民的文化艺术生活。
    电影，特别是苏联的具有高度思想性的影片为首都人民所普遍爱好。半年中，全市一共上演了六十部影片，有五十六部是新片，此外还举办了捷克斯洛伐克共和国和匈牙利人民共和国电影周。全市十七家电影院半年来的观众达一千四百三十多万人。居住在离电影院较远的城区和郊区人民，也时常可以看到数十个流动电影队的演出。北京市人民政府现正在劳动人民聚居的南城和北城新建设四个电影院和剧场，这些新建电影院和剧场落成后，每场可容纳三千三百多人，将进一步满足首都劳动人民的文化生活要求。
    戏剧和电影中的艺术形象给首都人民以很大的启发和教育，影、剧中的各种先进人物的优秀品质成为人们在生产、工作和生活中学习的榜样。清河制呢厂职工在看完“曙光照耀着莫斯科”话剧后举行了座谈会，许多工人热情地表示：要学习桑妮亚，使我们的产品越来越漂亮，越结实，满足人民的需要。北京市运输公司工会的搬运工人们曾举办电影“六号门”观后座谈会。中国少年儿童剧团演出“同志和你在一起”话剧后，许多中、小学校学生自动举行了座谈会和讨论会。这些受到感动和鼓舞的观众，都表示要向影、剧中的优秀人物学习。    （新华社）
