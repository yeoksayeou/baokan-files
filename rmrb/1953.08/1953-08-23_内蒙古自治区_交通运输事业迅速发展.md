The rapid recovery and development of transportation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has promoted the exchange of goods between urban and agricultural/pastoral areas.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region covers an area of more than 600,000 square kilometers and is rich in resources. However, due to the vast area and inconvenient transportation, agricultural and pastoral products were often stockpiled in large quantities before liberation, and timely supply of urban industrial products was out of the question. After the national liberation, thanks to the vigorous assistance of the Central People's Government, the transportation industry has gradually recovered and developed, and the remote areas of Inner Mongolia have shown a thriving new look. When the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region began to restore the transportation industry in 1950, only 507 kilometers of highways remained, having been destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. However, after more than three years of efforts by the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, in addition to the three railways such as Zheng (Zhengjiatun) - Da (Dahushan) line, Bai (Baichengzi) - A (Arxan) line which are closely connected with all parts of the country, sixteen highways have now been built, with a total length of more than 4,000 kilometers. The number of cars transporting passengers and goods has also increased from fifteen in 1950 to more than one hundred and forty. Now there are 2,600 kilometers of highways with regular buses running regularly between grasslands, rural areas and cities. The Xilin Gol League grassland, where cars had never appeared in the past, now not only has cargo trucks running regularly between Beizimiao (the capital of Xilin Gol League) and Zhangjiakou, more than 700 kilometers away, but also saw three brand-new comfortable passenger carriages specially for passengers in July this year. Recently, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government is also building the highway from Buxi (the seat of the Molidawa Banner government) to Xiaoergou, the capital of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, to further help the Oroqen people develop their cultural and economic undertakings.

On the vast land of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a powerful transportation network composed of trains, automobiles, and nearly 200,000 various animal-powered vehicles and camel teams constantly maintains the connection between urban and agricultural/pastoral areas, transporting large quantities of industrial products, food, and books to grasslands and rural areas, and transporting livestock, grain, fur, and various local and special products from grasslands and rural areas to all parts of the country. After the opening of passenger transport from Zhangjiakou to Beizimiao in 1952, more than 400,000 jin of wool and more than 100,000 jin of cashmere accumulated by herdsmen in the Xilin Gol League and Chahar League for many years were quickly transported to the cities. Since May of this year, the opening of passenger car service from Hailar to Amuzuolang, the central area of the New Barag Left Banner, has made it very convenient for the people of the banner to go to cities for shopping, medical treatment, bathing, and watching movies.

    内蒙古自治区
    交通运输事业迅速发展
    内蒙古自治区交通运输事业迅速恢复和发展，促进了城市与农、牧业区的物资交流。
    内蒙古自治区面积有六十多万平方公里，物产也非常丰富。但由于地区辽阔，交通不便，在解放前，农、牧业产品常年大量积压，城市工业品的及时供应更谈不到。全国解放后，由于中央人民政府的大力帮助，逐渐恢复与发展了交通事业，使内蒙古的边远地区已呈现欣欣向荣的新气象。当一九五零年内蒙古自治区开始着手恢复交通运输事业时，被国民党反动派破坏的公路线仅剩有五百零七公里，但经过内蒙古各族人民三年多的努力，现内蒙古地区除有郑（郑家屯）大（大虎山）线、白（白城子）阿（阿尔山）线等三条铁路与全国各地紧密联系在一起以外，现已修通了十六条公路线，长达四千余公里；运送旅客和货物的汽车也由一九五零年的十五辆，增至一百四十余辆。现在有二千六百公里的公路线经常跑着往返于草地、农村与城市间的定期班车。过去从未出现过汽车的锡林郭勒盟草原，现在不仅有了经常往返于贝子庙（锡林郭勒盟首府）到张家口七百多公里间的运货汽车，而且在今年七月份又出现了三辆崭新的专供旅客乘坐的舒适的棚车。最近，内蒙古自治区人民政府又在修建布西（莫力达瓦旗政府驻地）到鄂伦春自治旗首府小二沟的公路，以进一步帮助鄂伦春族发展文化和经济事业。
    在内蒙古自治区广大的土地上，已由火车、汽车和近二十万辆的各种兽力车，骆驼大队组成的强大运输网，经常的保持着城市与农、牧区的联系，运送大批的工业品、粮食和书籍到草地和农村，又把草地和农村的牲畜、粮食和皮毛以及各种土、特产品运往全国各地。一九五二年开辟了张家口至贝子庙的客运以后，锡林郭勒盟和察哈尔盟牧民积存多年的四十余万斤羊毛和十余万斤羊绒迅速地被运到城市。今年五月份起，海拉尔至新巴尔虎左翼旗中心地阿木左朗的客运汽车通车后，使得该旗人民能够很便利地到城市去购物、治病、洗澡和看电影。（新华社）
