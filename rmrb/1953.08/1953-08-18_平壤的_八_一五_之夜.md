    Pyongyang's "August 15th" Night
    (Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th) This year, Pyongyang's "August 15th" night was exceptionally splendid. As dusk slowly fell, thousands of lights twinkled along both banks of the Daedong River, and the five-pointed star atop the "Liberation Memorial Tower" on Moranbong Hill emitted its radiant glow. In the brightly lit streets, traffic bustled, and people flowed incessantly, with men, women, old, and young all dressed in their festive best.

    Every face wore a smile of victorious joy, tempered by severe trials. People stepped lightly to the lively and cheerful music from the loudspeakers. Several searchlights crisscrossed the sky with their enormous white beams. The sound of celebratory gun salutes rang out. Then, clusters of colorful fireworks painted a myriad of arcs in the clear night sky, crowning the victorious heroic city with a huge and brilliant pearl diadem.

    Roads, shops, and open-air stages decorated in red and green were all packed with people. The audience was captivated by the brilliant performances of amateur art troupes from factories and organizations, and students. The performers were surrounded by crowds of spectators who had forgotten the fatigue of marching in the hot sun during the day.

    Pyongyang's "August 15th" victory night made people linger in the joyful streets and theaters until late at night, reluctant to leave.

    平壤的“八·一五”之夜
    【新华社平壤十七日电】今年平壤的“八·一五”之夜格外灿烂。当夜幕徐徐降下的时候，大同江两岸万家灯火，牡丹峰“解放纪念塔”上的五角星放出光芒。在路灯通明的大街上，车水马龙，到处都是川流不息的人们，男女老幼都穿着节日的盛装。
    每一个人的脸上都浮着一种经过严重考验的胜利的欢笑。人们随着播音机里节奏活泼、明朗的音乐轻快地踏着步子。好几条探照灯的巨大的白色光柱交织在上空。礼炮声响了。接着一群群的彩色焰火，在晴朗的夜空里画着万道弧光，给这座胜利的英雄城市戴上一顶巨大而灿烂的珍珠冠。
    马路上，商店里，装饰得红红绿绿的露天舞台前面，到处都挤满了人。观众们被工厂、机关里的业余艺术团体和学生表演的精采节目吸引着，表演者被忘掉了白天在烈日下游行的疲劳的观众重重包围着。
    平壤“八·一五”胜利之夜，使人们至深夜还留恋着充满欢乐的大街和剧场，不肯散去。
