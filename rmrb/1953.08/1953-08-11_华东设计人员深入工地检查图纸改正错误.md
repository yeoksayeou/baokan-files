East China Architectural Design Company design personnel have gone deep into construction sites to inspect design drawings, discovering and correcting many shortcomings and errors in the design drawings, which has greatly contributed to ensuring the quality and progress of construction projects.

The East China Architectural Design Company's design tasks for 1953 were only handed down in the second quarter. The company's nearly two hundred design personnel completed 280,000 square meters of design work within a quarter. At that time, due to the large workload and the urgent demands from construction units, coupled with the varying degrees of carelessness among the design personnel themselves, and the lack of responsibility systems, drawing review systems, and design work liaison systems in the design process, there were many shortcomings and errors in the drawings, some of which were even unusable for construction. Eighty percent of the drawings for the 6,000-unit housing project at the seventh base of the Workshop Engineering Office had shortcomings. In order to correct the shortcomings and errors in the design drawings and ensure the quality and progress of the construction project, the company began to organize design personnel in batches and groups to go to construction sites to inspect the drawings in mid-July. Each group consisted mainly of the original designers and drafters, supplemented by technical personnel with construction experience and cost estimators. The company established a specialized organization to centralize leadership. Under the slogan of "Discover problems, correct errors, and ensure project quality," most technical personnel recognized that "the foundation for a hundred years lies in quality," and that going to construction sites to inspect drawings was the best way to correct shortcomings and errors in design drawings. The ideas of "fear of taking responsibility," "fear of hardship on construction sites," and "problems can be discovered while sitting in the office" that existed among some technical personnel were quickly overcome.

Through the diligent inspection of the design personnel, many shortcomings and errors in the drawings were discovered and corrected. Many inconsistencies between plan views and elevation views, and between section views and plan views were found, and preliminary corrections were made during this inspection. Omissions, errors, and incomplete information on the drawings were also remedied during this inspection. After going deep into the construction sites, most of the design personnel were able to humbly learn from the workers and listen to their opinions. The original design for the foundation of the classroom project at the Electrical Industry School required digging to a depth of 2.20 meters. The inspection team saw at the site that hardpan had appeared at a depth of 2 meters. After discussing with the workers, it was decided to reduce the digging by 40 centimeters. As a result, not only was the quality of the project unaffected, but investment was also saved.

    华东设计人员深入工地检查图纸改正错误
    华东建筑设计公司设计人员，深入工地检查设计图纸，发现和纠正了不少设计图纸上的缺点和错误，对保证施工工程质量和进度起了很大作用。
    华东建筑设计公司一九五三年的设计任务在第二季度才交下来。该公司的近二百个设计人员，在一个季度内，就完成了二十八万平方公尺的设计任务。当时，因为任务大，建筑单位催得急，加以设计人员本身也存在着程度不同的粗枝大叶作风，和设计工作中缺乏责任制、图纸审核制、设计工作联系制度等，图纸中有不少的缺点和错误，有的甚至不能用来进行施工。工房工程处第七基地六千户工房的图样中，有百分之八十都有缺点。该公司为了纠正设计图纸上的缺点和错误，保证施工工程的质量和进度，在七月中旬便开始组织设计人员分批分组下工地检查图纸。每小组的组员，尽可能以原设计人、绘图人为主，吸收有施工经验的技术人员和工程估算人员参加。公司成立专门机构，集中领导。在“发现问题纠正错误，保证工程质量”的口号下，大部分技术人员认识到“百年大计在于质量”，下工地检查是纠正设计图纸的缺点和错误的最好办法；在部分技术人员中存在着的“怕负责任”、“怕下工地吃苦”、“坐在办公室就可以发现问题”的思想，也很快地得到克服。
    经过设计人员认真检查，发现和纠正了许多图纸上的缺点和错误。平面图和立面图不符、剖面图和平面图不符等现象很多，经过这次检查，都得到了初步修正。图纸上漏注、错注和不完整的地方，也在这次检查中进行了弥补。参加检查的设计人员，深入工地以后，多数都能虚心向工人学习，听取工人的意见。电力工业学校教室工程的底脚，原设计需挖土深二点二○公尺，检查组在现场看到挖到二公尺时已呈现了老土，经和工人商量，便决定少挖四○公分，结果，不仅对工程质量没影响，还节省了投资。
