The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, 1953, No. 33, has been published.

This issue contains the news of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held from August 5th to 8th, the full text of the speech by G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, at the meeting, and, under the title "The General Line of Soviet Foreign Policy," reports on the reactions of progressive public opinion from various countries to the aforementioned meeting and speech.

This issue published an editorial entitled "The Soviet Union Defends Peace and the Security of All Peoples," stating that all honest people welcome and wholeheartedly support G.M. Malenkov's speech with great satisfaction; in his speech, he elaborated on the urgent tasks of the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union in domestic and foreign policy. The goal of Soviet foreign policy has always been to consolidate peace and the security of all peoples. No matter how frantically the propagandists and slanderers of the imperialist camp clamor, no matter how the enemies of peace carry out provocations, they can absolutely not cover up the truth that the Soviet Union unswervingly pursues a policy of peace.

Important articles published in this issue include: "We Must Protect Our Sacred Fruits of Victory as We Protect the Apples of Our Eyes" by Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers; "The 'Charity' to East Berlin" by William Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States; and "The Inside Story of Dulles' Trip to Korea" by John Smith.

Hoxha's article first discusses the resolution passed by the joint meeting of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, the Council of Ministers, and the Presidium of the People's Assembly on July 23 to streamline the central state organs. He points out that the purpose of this measure is to reduce the expenditure of state organs and make them stronger and more capable of successfully completing the major tasks entrusted to them by the Party and the government—completing the Five-Year Plan and ensuring the continuous improvement of the people's livelihood and welfare, so that Albania's national defense forces are greatly strengthened, and loyally defend the interests and fruits of victory of the people. The article then describes the policies of the government of the People's Republic of Albania. In terms of domestic policy, the current main tasks include: formulating all necessary measures to ensure that the national industrial sector completes its production plan, in order to supply urban and rural residents with a predetermined quantity of goods in a timely and uninterrupted manner; making special efforts to expand and strengthen the food industry; considering reducing the working speed of some less urgent projects without violating the principles of the plan, and considering increasing agricultural investment; considering taking further measures to reduce the burden on farmers; taking measures to continuously consolidate and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance and urban-rural relations, and expand the exchange of industrial and agricultural products; and further strengthening the people's army, security organs, and border defense forces.

Foster's article is reprinted from the August 4th issue of the American "Worker's Daily." The article denounces the new trick recently played by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, namely "charity" in the form of grain to the people of East Berlin, in an attempt to stir up trouble in East Germany. The article says: This is an extreme insult to the German people, an absurd and despicable act, and in fact, a tyrannical interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

Smith's article exposes the aggressive essence of the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by Dulles and Syngman Rhee in Seoul on August 8. The article points out that this "treaty" is a naked aggressive conspiracy between the United States and Syngman Rhee to undermine the Korean armistice, and that this "treaty" once again proves that the ruling circles of the United States and their lackey Syngman Rhee intend to continue to follow the path of aggression and pursue policies that will worsen the international situation in the future.

This issue also publishes a feature by British writer Jack Lindsay, "Song of Unity," describing the achievements of the 4th World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第三十三期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第三十三期中文版已经出版。
    本期刊载了苏联最高苏维埃八月五日至八日举行第五次会议的消息，苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫在会议上的演说全文，并在“苏联外交政策的总路线”的标题下，报道了世界各国进步舆论对上述会议和演说的反应。
    本期以“苏联保卫着和平和各国人民的安全”为题发表社论说，所有正直的人们都极为满意地欢迎并衷心拥护格·马·马林科夫的演说；他在演说中详尽地提出了苏联共产党和政府在国内和外交政策方面的迫切任务。苏联外交政策所争取的目标一向是巩固和平和各国人民的安全。无论帝国主义阵营的造谣者和诽谤者如何疯狂叫嚣，无论和平的敌人如何进行挑衅，他们绝对掩盖不了苏联坚定不移地奉行和平政策的真理。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会总书记、部长会议主席恩维尔·霍查的“我们要像保护眼珠似地保护我们神圣的胜利果实”。美国共产党全国委员会主席威廉·福斯特的“对东柏林的‘施舍’”，约翰·史密斯的“杜勒斯先生朝鲜之行的内幕”。
    霍查的文章首先谈到阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、部长会议和人民议会主席团七月二十三日举行联席会议通过精简国家中央机构的决议，他指出：这种措施的目的在于使国家机构的开支减少，而且更加坚强有力，更能胜利地完成党和政府所交付的重大任务——完成五年计划以及保证人民生活福利的不断提高，使阿尔巴尼亚的国防力量大大增强，忠诚地捍卫着人民的利益和胜利果实。文章接着叙述了阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府的政策。在国内政策方面，目前的主要任务包括：制定一切必要措施来保证国家工业部门完成生产计划，以便及时地、不间断地供给城乡居民以预定数量的物品；特别努力扩充和加强食品工业；在不违背计划的原则下考虑减低某些并不迫切的工程的工作速度，考虑增加农业投资；考虑采取进一步减轻农民负担的措施；采取措施来不断地巩固和加强工农联盟以及城乡关系，扩大工业品和农产品的交流；进一步加强人民军、保安机关及保卫边疆的部队。
    福斯特的文章转载自八月四日的美国“工人日报”。文章斥责美国国务卿杜勒斯最近玩出的新花样，即“施舍”粮食给东柏林人民，企图由此在东德引起骚动。文章说：这是对德国人民的极端侮辱，是荒谬绝顶的卑劣行为，实际上是专横地干涉他国的内政。
    史密斯的文章揭露杜勒斯和李承晚八月八日在汉城签订的所谓“共同防御条约”的侵略本质。文章指出，这个“条约”是美国和李承晚合谋破坏朝鲜停战的赤裸裸的侵略阴谋，这个“条约”再一次证明美国统治集团及其走狗李承晚打算今后还要走侵略的路，还要奉行使国际局势恶化的政策。
    本期还刊载了英国作家杰克·林赛的特写“团结的歌曲”，叙述第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的成就。（新华社）
