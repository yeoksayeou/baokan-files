Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 20th. Special Correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Since the exchange of prisoners of war began on August 5th, the lie-mongers employed by the American propaganda machine, under the direction and assistance of the American military authorities, have incessantly fabricated lies to slander the Korean and Chinese side for "abusing" prisoners of war. They have attempted to use these sensational myths to drown out the truth about the Korean and Chinese side's lenient treatment of prisoners of war and to divert the world's attention from the fact that the U.S. side is inhumanely mistreating and persecuting prisoners of war.

As during the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war in April and May, American lie-mongers are creating myths about so-called "death marches" and "death camps." But the more these lie-mongers create these absurd myths, the more thoroughly their lying faces are exposed.

For example, they insist that a large number of prisoners of war died in the Pingtong prisoner of war camp. The number of dead prisoners of war has been fabricated one after another. The same Associated Press reported at least six or seven different figures. On August 7, it reported that about 1,000 American prisoners of war died in the Pingtong prisoner of war camp in two and a half years. On August 9, it reported that 1,800 prisoners of war died in Pingtong. On August 10, it reported that 4,400 prisoners of war died in Pingtong between February and August 1951, and the same news also reported that nearly 2,400 prisoners of war died. On the same day, it also reported that 2,200 to 2,300 prisoners of war died in Pingtong during the winter between 1950 and 1951. The difference between the highest and lowest figures in these contradictory and chaotic figures is as much as 3,400. However, Associated Press reporter Franklin reported that British prisoner of war賀埃尔, who returned from the Pingtong prisoner of war camp, said, "Few people died in our prisoner of war camp." When reporting these so-called figures of dead prisoners of war, the Associated Press, this rumor-mongering organization, is only desperately trying to create the illusion that a large number of prisoners of war really died in the Pingtong prisoner of war camp. However, this rumor-mongering organization obviously does not care about the possible consequences of these figures being contradictory and chaotic, and it obviously does not care that people can easily conclude that these are just rumors and not facts.

In fact, if the number of American prisoners of war who died, fabricated by American lie-mongers, is added up, the total number far exceeds the total number of American soldiers captured announced by the American authorities. U.S. Army Commander Clark gave a speech in Washington on August 6, insisting that the Korean and Chinese side held 2,000 to 3,000 American prisoners of war during the war, in addition to the more than 3,000 who were preparing to be repatriated. That is to say, Clark believes that the Korean and Chinese side held 5,000 to 6,000 American prisoners of war. However, according to International News Service reports, the U.S. Army newspaper "Stars and Stripes," after "analyzing reports of American prisoners of war dying in North Korea," "determined that the number of deaths may be as high as 6,000." If the reports about "death camps" and "death marches" fabricated by the American propaganda machine are true, then all the American prisoners of war held by the Korean and Chinese side should have died long ago. In this case, the more than 3,000 American prisoners of war that the Korean and Chinese side are successively repatriating are not living people but ghosts. Isn't this a big joke!

In addition to fabricating something out of nothing, American lie-mongers also have a technique of deliberately distorting the facts by adding fuel to the fire. Associated Press reporters Kendrick and Hanson have both played this trick. It is clear that the Korean and Chinese side is using advanced "organizational therapy" to treat prisoners of war, but they insist that it is "using prisoners of war as guinea pigs for 'medical experiments'." It is clear that the seven Colombian prisoners of war who were repatriated were "in very good physical condition," but they said that they may have "hidden diseases."

The ridiculous thing is that these lie-mongers often get slapped in the face by their colleagues when they are spreading rumors recklessly, and sometimes they even slap themselves in the face. Associated Press reporter Kendrick falsely accused the Korean and Chinese side of "encouraging" prisoners of war to smoke a narcotic weed, but another Associated Press reporter, Samson, reported that the Korean and Chinese side prohibited prisoners of war from smoking this weed, "and would impose imprisonment as a punishment if it was discovered." Since many British prisoners of war admitted that the Korean and Chinese side gave them good treatment after repatriation, American news agencies tried to make people believe that the Korean and Chinese side treated British prisoners of war and American prisoners of war differently. However, Associated Press reporter Frank King reported that "Commonwealth prisoners of war released from the fifth prisoner of war camp in Pingtong insist that prisoners of war, regardless of nationality, are treated equally."

From these examples, it can be seen how vicious and despicable these lie-mongers' intentions are, but how stupid and clumsy their tricks are.

These servants of the American propaganda machine have recently made a lot of noise about the Korean and Chinese side punishing prisoners of war. Many American prisoners of war admitted to them that the reason they were punished was because they stole things, set fire to houses, fought, smoked narcotic weeds, murdered prisoner of war camp staff, organized even the "Ku Klux Klan," which is said to be not allowed even by the U.S. Department of Justice, and raped women... Are these behaviors permissible by the laws of any country or any army? The American propaganda machine is trying its best to complain for them, calling the punishment given to them by the Korean and Chinese side "unfair punishment," and exaggerating and fabricating this punishment into a terrifying story. Are these legal and normal behaviors according to the American way of life?

In fact, the vast majority of American prisoners of war are unwilling to fabricate stories of so-called "atrocities" against their conscience, so that International News Service reporter Janice has to admit that, judging from the actions of many American prisoners of war, "it seems that the communists have no conspiracy at all." They are also "unwilling to narrate cases of their companions being unfairly punished." The American propaganda machine is now trying its best to create stories of so-called "progressives," insisting that these "progressives" assisted the Korean and Chinese prisoner of war camp authorities in "abusing" prisoners of war. At the same time, they are also threatening to punish these "progressives" in an attempt to create a climate of terror and force prisoners of war to fabricate stories about "atrocities" in order to show that they are not "progressives." In fact, Associated Press reporter Edwards admitted that this story about so-called "progressives" was told with "embellishment" under the prodding of American reporters. He said, "News reporters are always asking this question in repeated interviews," so "many of the repatriated people realized this trend and exaggerated his story to show off."

The lies fabricated by the servants of the American propaganda machine have all gone bankrupt, but the same lies are still being fabricated in large quantities. These disciples of Dr. Goebbels obviously believe that lies will become the truth as long as they are constantly repeated and spread. However, Goebbels has been buried by the lies he fabricated, and the fate of American lie-mongers will certainly not be better than that of their master.

### 美方制造我方“虐待”战俘的谎言完全破产  反使美国谎言贩子自己陷于矛盾百出和混乱不堪的境地

    美方制造我方“虐待”战俘的谎言完全破产
    反使美国谎言贩子自己陷于矛盾百出和混乱不堪的境地
    【新华社开城二十日电】本社特派记者江南报道：自从双方在八月五日开始交换战俘以来，美国宣传机器所雇用的谎言贩子们，就在美国军事当局的指使和协助之下，滔滔不绝地制造诬蔑朝中方面
    “虐待”战俘的谎言。他们企图用这种耸人听闻的神话，淹没朝中方面宽待战俘的真相，转移全世界对于美方惨无人道地虐待和迫害战俘的事实的愤慨的注视。
    像在四、五月间双方交换病伤战俘的时候一样，美国的谎言贩子们大肆制造关于所谓“死亡行军”、
    “死亡营”的神话。可是这些谎言贩子们越是制造这种荒诞无稽的神话，他们的说谎者的嘴脸就暴露得越彻底。
    比如，他们硬说在碧潼战俘营中曾经死亡了大批战俘。死亡战俘的数字一个接一个地被制造出来。同一个合众社，至少报道了六、七个不同的数字。它在八月七日报道说，碧潼战俘营在两年半中死亡美国战俘一千名左右。八月九日又报道说，在碧潼死亡战俘一千八百名。八月十日又报道说，在一九五一年二月到八月期间，在碧潼死亡战俘四千四百名，同一个消息又报道说，死亡战俘接近二千四百人。同一天它又报道说，在一九五○年和一九五一年之间的冬季，在碧潼死亡战俘二千二百人到二千三百人。在这些矛盾而混乱的数字中，最高数字和最低数字相差竟达三千四百名之多。可是合众社记者弗兰克林却又报道说，从碧潼战俘营回去的英国战俘贺埃尔说，“我们战俘营中死人很少”。合众社这家造谣机关在报道这些所谓死亡战俘数字的时候，只是拚命企图制造一种错觉，好像在碧潼战俘营中真的死亡了大批战俘。但是这家造谣机关对于这些数字由于矛盾百出和混乱不堪可能产生什么结果，显然是不管的，对于人们由此很容易作出这只是谣言而不是事实的结论，也显然是并不在乎的。
    事实上，如果把美国谎言贩子们制造出来的美国战俘死亡的数字加到一起，那末总数就大大超过了美国官方所宣布的被俘美军士兵的总数。美军总司令克拉克八月六日在华盛顿发表谈话，硬说朝中方面在战争期间所收容的美国战俘，除了准备遣返的三千多名以外，还有二千到三千名。这就是说，克拉克认为朝中方面收容的美国战俘有五千名到六千名。可是据国际新闻社报道，美国陆军报纸“星条报”在“分析了关于美国战俘死在北朝鲜的报道”以后，“断定死亡人数可能高达六千名”。如果美国宣传机器所制造的关于“死亡营”、“死亡行军”的报道是真实的话，那末朝中方面所收容的美国战俘应该早已全部死光了。这样说来，朝中方面正在陆续遣返的三千多名美国战俘，竟然不是活生生的人而是鬼，这岂非天大的笑话！
    美国的谎言贩子们除了无中生有地捏造以外，还有一个手法是故意加油加酱地进行歪曲。合众社记者肯德里克和韩森都玩过这种花样。明明是朝中方面用先进的“组织疗法”给战俘治病，他们却硬说是“把战俘当作豚鼠进行‘医学实验’”。明明被遣返的七个哥伦比亚战俘“体格很不坏”，他们却说他们可能有“暗疾”。
    可笑的是：这些谎言贩子们在肆意造谣的时候，常常挨到他们同行的耳光，有时甚至不惜自己打自己的耳光。合众社记者肯德里克诬蔑朝中方面“鼓励”战俘吸食一种麻醉性的毒草，可是合众社的另一个记者萨姆松却报道说，朝中方面禁止战俘吸食这种毒草，“如有发现，就予以监禁处分”。由于许多英国战俘在遣返以后都承认朝中方面给予他们良好待遇，美国通讯社企图要人们相信朝中方面对英国战俘和美国战俘不同。可是美联社记者兰克·金却报道说，“从碧潼第五号战俘营被释放回来的英联邦战俘们坚持说，战俘们不分国籍，一律受到平等的待遇。”
    从这些例子中可以看出，这些谎言贩子们的用心是多么恶毒和卑鄙，可是他们的伎俩却又是多么愚蠢和拙劣。
    美国宣传机器的这些佣仆们最近还对朝中方面处罚战俘做了许多文章。许多美国战俘向他们承认，他们之所以受到处罚，是由于他们在战俘营里偷盗东西，放火烧房子，打架，吸食麻醉性毒草，谋害战俘营工作人员，组织甚至据说连美国的司法部都不容许的“三K党”，强奸妇女……。这些行为难道是任何国家任何军队的法律所能容许的吗？美国宣传机器竭力替他们喊冤，把朝中方面给予他们的处分说成是“不公平的处罚”，并且把这种处罚渲染和捏造成恐怖的故事。难道按照美国生活方式这些都是合法的正常的行为吗？
    事实上，绝大部分美国战俘不愿违背良心捏造所谓“暴行”的故事，以致国际新闻社记者杰尼斯也不得不承认，从许多美国战俘的行动看来，“好像共方根本没有什么阴谋鬼计似的”。他们也“不愿叙述他们的同伴受到不公平的处罚的事例”。美国宣传机器现在正竭力制造所谓“进步分子”的故事，硬说这些“进步分子”协助朝中战俘营当局“虐待”战俘。同时他们又扬言要对这些“进步分子”加以处罚，企图制造恐怖气氛，迫使战俘为了表示自己不是“进步分子”，不得不捏造关于“暴行”的故事。而实际上，美联社记者爱德华兹承认，这种关于所谓“进步分子”的故事，全是在美国记者的追逼下“添油加醋地”讲出来的。他说，“新闻记者在反覆进行的访问中，老是问这个问题”，于是，“有很多的被遣返归来的人，觉察到这种趋向，就把他的故事大事渲染一番，借此出一下风头”。
    美国宣传机器的佣仆们所制造的谎言已经全部破产了，可是同样的谎言却仍然在继续被大量制造出来。这些戈培尔博士的信徒们显然相信，谎言只要不断地重复散布，就会成为真理。但是，戈培尔已经被他自己制造的谎言埋葬了，美国谎言贩子们的命运，也决不会比他们的这位师傅更好一些。
