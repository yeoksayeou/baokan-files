    Most Engineering Companies of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the Northeast Region
    Have Not Seriously Implemented the Responsibility System
    Shenyang City Engineering Units Launch Mass Quality Inspection
    [This newspaper reports] The Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government recently inspected the implementation of the responsibility system by its affiliated engineering companies in the Northeast region. The inspection revealed that most engineering companies have not seriously implemented this work.
    Those units that have been able to implement the responsibility system and have done a relatively good job include the Anshan Iron and Steel's Rolling Steel Engineering Company, the Second Section of the Steelmaking Engineering Company, the Civil Engineering and Construction Company, the Third Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Administration, the Second Engineering Company and the Riveting and Welding Factory, and the Jinxi Chemical Factory construction site of the Chemical Engineering Company. The reason why these units have implemented the responsibility system better is mainly because the leading cadres of these units recognized that the purpose of establishing the responsibility system is to improve construction management. Therefore, they have focused on the two main links of the technical responsibility system and the construction responsibility system, thereby improving and strengthening technical management and planning management, enabling continuous improvement of project quality, and ensuring that projects can proceed according to plan. The 301 Factory project contracted by the Third Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Administration had very poor project quality in the past. Since the establishment of the technical responsibility system in April, quality accidents have gradually decreased, and only one quality accident has occurred from June to now. In the undertaking of the large motor factory project of the Electric Appliance Factory No. 4 by the Riveting and Welding Factory, due to the implementation of the construction responsibility system, the project quality increased from 95% to 99.65%, exceeding the quality target. Because the Rolling Steel Company of Anshan Iron and Steel and the Second Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Administration thoroughly implemented the construction responsibility system, the construction operation plan was guaranteed, and the project could be constructed according to plan. Because there are dedicated personnel responsible for the supply of materials, equipment, and tools, these units have also made achievements in terms of "saving."
    However, most engineering companies have not seriously understood the spirit of establishing the responsibility system. Some companies have not even started to establish a responsibility system at all; some companies are "establishing a responsibility system for the sake of establishing a responsibility system" and do not implement it; some companies have not grasped the main links, so the chaotic situation of construction management has not been improved. The dedicated engineer of the Second Construction Site of the First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Administration believes: "It doesn't matter whether the responsibility system is established or not. It is not a good phenomenon to establish it well, because everyone's division of labor is too obvious to be able to contact each other. It is better to 'push' people to do it." Therefore, this construction site basically has not established a responsibility system; also precisely because there is no responsibility system, this construction site only completed 8.7% of the annual task by the end of June, there were six quality accidents a day, and construction was suspended for eleven days due to the failure to supply doors and windows. Some companies have developed a sense of relaxation and complacency. Seeing that workers have exposed many problems and are very active in establishing a responsibility system, they mistakenly believe that the responsibility system has been established. The leading cadres of the First Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Administration saw that the responsibility system at the large motor factory construction site of the Electric Appliance Factory No. 4 was doing a good job, and said: "Okay, with this set, we can make it next year!" As a result, they have a complacent and relaxed mood. As a result, they believe that the best large motor factory construction site has only implemented 22% of the established responsibility system, and the systems of other construction sites have not even been announced to the workers. The Dalian Chemical Engineering Company and the Jilin Chemical Factory construction site of the Chemical Engineering Company have the same situation. There are also companies that have not yet figured out the way to establish a responsibility system. The Benxi North Manchuria Industrial Company and the Dalian Chemical Engineering Company did not try to improve the technical management and planning management of the construction site, but instead used a lot of effort to engage in the "Finance Section"; the Benxi Civil Engineering and Construction Company focused on "original records" and "opening up ideas and specifically helping the group leaders do a good job of the group leader's daily report," so that the responsibility system has not been well established.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 8) Since late July, basic construction engineering companies in Shenyang City have launched mass quality inspections one after another on the basis of implementing the responsibility system. Through this quality inspection, the construction units will further implement technical operating procedures, strengthen the technical management of construction, establish and improve quality inspection agencies and systems, in order to ensure that the project quality meets the national standards. At present, the Second Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Administration, the First Engineering Company, the Second Engineering Company, and the Third Engineering Company of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau have completed the inspection; the First Engineering Company of the Electrical Appliance Industry Administration and the Shenyang Construction Engineering Company and the Shenyang Installation Engineering Company of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry of the Central Government are actively preparing or carrying out the inspection. During the inspection, the Second Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Administration organized a working group of more than 80 people to conduct in-depth inspections of various construction sites. For the quality problems found in the inspection, they immediately looked for the reasons and put forward improvement opinions to the inspected units; the engineering companies under the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, taking the construction site as a unit, mobilized the masses of workers to focus on inspecting the important parts of the project – concrete engineering and brick masonry engineering. In the inspection, each construction site also organized workers and cadres to study quality indicators, and combined with quality accidents to conduct quality education for workers.
    After the initial inspection of the units, workers and cadres have generally enhanced their emphasis on project quality. At present, some units are starting from strengthening management work and implementing various systems, and actively solving the problems found in the inspection. The situation of low project quality in some units has begun to change. For example, the leaders of the 308 construction site absorbed old workers to enrich the inspection agency, organized workers to study operating procedures and quality indicators, and after carrying out regular inspection work, they have corrected the past shortcomings such as uneven width of iron bars and loose buckle twisting. The third construction site of the Nanhu of the Second Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Administration has also begun to change the phenomena of incomplete mortar and uneven walls in brick masonry engineering after improving the system and strengthening inspection work.

    重工业部在东北区的大部分工程公司
    没有认真贯彻责任制
    沈阳市各工程单位开展群众性质量检查
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部最近检查了所属在东北地区的各工程公司贯彻责任制的情况。检查结果，发现大部分工程公司还没有认真做好贯彻责任制这一项工作。
    能够贯彻执行责任制而且比较执行得好的有鞍钢的轧钢工程公司、炼钢工程公司二工段、土木建筑工程公司，有色金属管理局第三工程公司、第二工程公司和铆焊工厂以及化学工程公司锦西化工厂工地等单位。这些单位的责任制贯彻执行得较好，主要是因为这些单位的领导干部认清了建立责任制的目的是改进施工管理，因此特别抓紧了技术责任制和施工责任制两个主要环节，从而改善了和加强了技术管理和计划管理，使工程质量不断提高，工程能按计划进行。有色金属管理局第三工程公司承包的三○一厂工程，过去工程质量很坏，自从四月份建立了技术责任制以后，质量事故逐渐减少，从六月到现在只发生一次质量事故。铆焊工厂在承修电工四厂大型电机厂工程中，由于贯彻执行了施工专责制，工程质量由百分之九十五提高到百分之九十九点六五，超过了质量指标。鞍钢轧钢公司和有色金属管理局第二工程公司由于彻底执行了施工责任制，施工作业计划得到保证，工程能够按计划施工。由于材料、设备、工具供应有专人负责，这些单位在“省”的方面也做出了成绩。
    但是大部分工程公司还没有认真地领会建立责任制的精神。有的公司还根本没有着手建立责任制；有的公司“为建立责任制而建立责任制”，不去贯彻执行；有的公司没有抓住主要环节，因此施工管理的混乱情况没有得到改进。有色金属管理局第一工程公司第二工地的专责工程师认为：“责任制建不建立没啥关系，建立得好也不是好现象，因为大家分工太明显就不能互相联系了，还不如‘推’着干。”因此这个工地基本上没有建立责任制；也正是因为没有建立责任制，所以这个工地到六月末只完成全年任务百分之八点七，一天出过六次质量事故，还因门窗口供应不上停工十一天。有的公司产生了松劲、自满情绪，看到工人揭发的问题很多，建立责任制时也很积极，就错误地以为责任制搞起来了。有色金属管理局第一工程公司的领导干部看到电工四厂大型电机厂工地责任制搞得不错，就说：“行了，有这一套明年也吃得开！”于是就有了自满、松劲的情绪。结果，他们认为最好的大型电机厂工地也只把已建立的责任制度贯彻了百分之二十二，其他工地的制度甚至还没有向工人宣布。大连化学工程公司和化学工程公司吉林化工厂工地都有同样情况。还有的公司到现在还没有摸清建立责任制的门路。本溪北满工业公司和大连化学工程公司不去设法改进工地的技术管理和计划管理，却用很大的力量去搞“财务科”；本溪土木建筑工程公司着重搞“原始记录”和“打通思想、具体帮助组长做好组长日报”，以致责任制还没有很好地建立起来。
    【新华社沈阳八日电】沈阳市各基本建设工程公司在贯彻责任制的基础上，从七月下旬起相继开展了群众性的质量大检查。通过这次质量检查，各施工单位将进一步贯彻技术操作规程，加强施工的技术管理，建立和健全质量检查的机构和制度，以求工程质量达到国家规定的标准。现在，有色金属管理局第二工程公司、沈阳市建筑工程局所属的第一工程公司、第二工程公司和第三工程公司等单位已经检查完毕；电器工业管理局第一工程公司和中央第一机械工业部的沈阳建筑工程公司、沈阳安装工程公司等单位，正在积极准备或进行中。在检查中，有色金属管理局第二工程公司组织了八十多人的工作组，深入各个工地进行了检查。对于在检查中发现的质量问题，都立即寻找原因，并向被检查单位提出了改进意见；沈阳市建筑工程局所属各工程公司在检查中以工地为单位，发动职工群众着重检查了工程重要部分——混凝土工程和砌砖工程。各工地在检查中还组织工人和干部学习质量指标，并结合质量事故向工人进行了质量教育。
    经过初步检查的单位，工人和干部普遍增强了对工程质量的重视。目前，有些单位正在从加强管理工作和贯彻各项制度着手，积极解决检查中发现的问题。有些单位工程质量低劣的情况已开始改变，如三零八工地的领导方面吸收老工人充实检查机构，组织工人学习操作规程和质量指标，开展了经常性检查工作后，已经纠正了过去铁筋做得宽窄不均、扣拧得不紧等缺点。有色金属管理局第二工程公司南湖第三工地，在健全制度和加强检查工作后，砌砖工程灰浆不满、墙面不平等现象也开始得到转变。
