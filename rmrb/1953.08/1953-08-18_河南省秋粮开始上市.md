    Henan Province's Autumn Grain Begins to Enter the Market
    In early August, various autumn grains in Henan Province began to enter the market. In the primary markets of Chenliu, Xincai, Zhecheng, and Gushu counties, the daily market volume of sorghum and beans reached 100,000 jin. In western and southern Henan, the market volume of early-maturing corn and various beans is also increasing daily. This summer, Henan Province has had sufficient rainfall, and autumn crops are growing extremely well. It is estimated that the average yield of autumn grain per mu in the province will increase by more than 10% compared to last year, and the autumn grain yield in many places will reach the highest level since liberation. The Henan Provincial State-owned Grain Company and the Provincial Cooperative have signed an agreement to purchase autumn grain on consignment, and are actively cooperating in the procurement.

    河南省秋粮开始上市
    八月上旬，河南省各种秋粮开始上市。陈留、新蔡、柘城和谷熟等县初级市场，每天上市的高粱、豆类达十万斤。豫西、豫南各县早熟的玉米和各种豆类，上市量也逐日增多。今夏河南省雨量充足，秋季作物生长极好，估计今年全省每亩秋粮平均产量将较去年增产一成以上，许多地方的秋粮产量将达解放以来的最高水平。河南省国营粮食公司和省合作社已签订了代购秋粮协议，互相配合积极收购。
