Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 1st: American Communist Party Chairman William Z. Foster published an article in the New York "Daily Worker" on July 30th, entitled "Korea Is Not Spain."

The article said: Wall Street war planners once attempted to turn Korea into another Spain; to turn the Korean civil war into a prelude to a world war – they hoped to use this war to achieve world hegemony. However, the result was that Korea did not become Spain. This is because the forces of peace have greatly strengthened since the Spanish Civil War. In the past three years of arduous struggle, the strength of the peace forces has been sufficient to save Korea from repeating the fate of the Spanish Republic. The heroic armies of Korea and China intercepted all imperialist forces; socialist countries and people's democratic countries carried out resolute political and diplomatic struggles, defeating the United States' attempt to expand the Korean War; and the masses of people in capitalist countries, including the United States, refused to support their own government's imperialist attempt to expand the Korean War into a world war.

Therefore, the Wall Street war makers were forced to sign the Korean armistice agreement.

The article continued: As stated in the American Communist Party's statement, the Korean armistice is a victory for the world's peace forces. However, this victory is not final. The war hawks have not given up their hope of using Korea as a springboard for war in Asia and the world. The most obvious evidence is that the US government has threatened to withdraw from the negotiations if the upcoming negotiations cannot meet its demands after three months. Eisenhower and Dulles's three-month ultimatum is a dangerous war provocation.

This means that the State Department will try to undermine the negotiations and prevent them from succeeding. Now, government officials, military leaders, and major newspapers have expressed gloomy and despairing views on the effectiveness of the armistice, which is enough to show that they are taking preliminary actions to deliberately obstruct it. Washington and its mouthpieces are now explaining in various ways that they do not welcome peace in Korea.

The article emphasized: Peace-loving people must immediately and resolutely condemn Eisenhower and Dulles's absurd three-month ultimatum. Such arbitrary actions must not be allowed, and no deadlines should be set. The peace conference should be given ample time to continue in a free atmosphere to resolve the many complex issues it will encounter.

The article concluded: Korea should never become the beginning of a major war according to the wishes of Wall Street, but should become the initial stage of consolidating world peace according to the wishes of our country and the people of other countries.
Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 2nd: According to a report in the New York "Daily Worker" on July 28th: Stephen Nelson, Benjamin Carreathers, and others, Pittsburgh American Communist Party leaders who were illegally arrested and imprisoned two years ago for demanding peace in Korea, issued a joint statement on the Korean armistice. The statement said: The signing of the Korean armistice agreement is a major step towards world peace. All of us Pittsburgh Smith Act defendants cheer for the armistice and believe that this armistice is a major blow to the war hawks who framed us and persecuted other Communist leaders. We were persecuted because we opposed American intervention in Korea. The statement called on the American people to strengthen the struggle against thought control trials and against all political persecutions by the McCarthy group. The statement said: This struggle for civil rights can be won. After the victory of peace, domestic victory will also come. We can unite and fight to stop the McCarthy group from viciously questioning good people in Congress. We can stop the killing of black people. The victory of peace can pave the way for the people to win victories on every front.

### 美共主席福斯特号召美国人民提高警惕  制止美政府阻挠政治会议的活动

    美共主席福斯特号召美国人民提高警惕
    制止美政府阻挠政治会议的活动
    【新华社柏林一日电】美国共产党主席福斯特七月三十日在纽约“工人日报”上发表文章，题目是“朝鲜不是西班牙”。
    文章说：华尔街战争策划者曾经企图把朝鲜变成另一个西班牙；把朝鲜的内战变成世界大战的前奏——他们希望借这次战争来取得世界霸权。但是，结果朝鲜并没有成为西班牙。这是因为，自从西班牙内战以来，和平的力量已经大大地加强了。在过去三年艰苦的斗争中，和平力量的强大已足以拯救朝鲜，使它不致再蹈西班牙共和国的覆辙。朝鲜和中国的英勇的军队拦截住了一切帝国主义军队；社会主义国家和人民民主国家进行坚决的政治斗争和外交斗争，打败了美国要扩大朝鲜战争的企图，资本主义国家包括美国的人民大众拒绝支持他们本国政府要把朝鲜战争扩大为世界大战的帝国主义企图。
    因此，华尔街的战争制造者不得已而在朝鲜签订了停战协定。
    文章接着说：诚如美国共产党的声明所说的，朝鲜停火是世界和平力量的胜利。但是，这个胜利还不是最后的。战争贩子还没有放弃他们把朝鲜当作亚洲和世界大战跳板的希望，最明显的证据就是美国政府扬言假如即将举行的谈判在三个月之后不能满足它的要求，它就要退出谈判。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯这个三个月期限的要胁，是危险的战争挑衅。
    这就意味着，国务院将要设法破坏谈判，并妨碍谈判取得成功。现在，政府官员和军事领袖以及各家大报已经对停战的效力问题表示了黯淡和绝望的论调，这就足以叫人看出他们正采取蓄意阻挠的初步行动。华盛顿和它的喉舌现在已在以种种方式说明，朝鲜的和平是他们所不欢迎的。
    文章着重指出：爱好和平的人民必须马上坚决地斥责艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯这个荒唐的三月期限的要胁。决不能容许这种专横行动，不能提出任何期限。和平会议应该有它所需要的充裕的时间开下去，以在自由的气氛中解决它将要碰到的那许多复杂问题。
    文章最后说：朝鲜决不应该按照华尔街的愿望成为大战的开端，而应该按照我国以及他国人民的愿望，成为巩固的世界和平的初步阶段。
    【新华社柏林二日电】据纽约“工人日报”七月二十八日报道：两年前因要求实现朝鲜和平而被非法逮捕下狱的匹兹堡美国共产党领袖斯蒂芬·纳尔逊、本杰明·卡里瑟斯等人就朝鲜停战发表联合声明。声明说：朝鲜停战协定的签字是走向世界和平的一大步。我们匹兹堡的全体史密斯法案被告人都为停战而欢呼，并且认为这次停战对陷害我们并迫害其他共产党领袖的战争贩子是一个重大的打击，我们之所以遭受迫害是因为我们反对美国干涉朝鲜。声明号召美国人民加强反对控制思想的审讯和反对麦卡锡集团的一切政治迫害的斗争。声明说：这个争取公民权利的斗争是能够取得胜利的。和平胜利之后，国内的胜利也会到来。我们能够团结一致，进行斗争，以阻止麦卡锡集团在国会中对善良人民进行恶毒的盘问。我们能够阻止对黑人的杀害。和平的胜利能为人民在每一条战线上获得胜利铺平道路。
