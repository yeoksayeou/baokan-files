    Fenghua County Farm Should Improve Its Work
    Comrade Ying Defang of the CCP Fenghua County Committee, Zhejiang Province, writes: "Last year, the rice that fell down the most was in the farm's fields, and this year, the fields with the most barnyard grass are also the farm's." This is the criticism of the county farm's work from the farmers of Fenghua County. When I participated in the early rice field exhibition of the county farm on July 20th, I also heard some farmer representatives who went to visit mention this problem.
    How was this situation in Fenghua County Farm created? Last year, due to the county farm blindly applying fertilizer and not believing in the actual experience of the masses, the rice stalks were not strong, and they fell down with a single strong wind. Although there have been some improvements in this regard this year, because the farm's leading cadres lack political and ideological education for the workers and rarely inspect the field work, some workers did not weed carefully, only removing weeds but not barnyard grass, so there is a particularly large amount of barnyard grass this year. According to the estimates of some farmer representatives, the average yield per mu may be reduced by about 30 to 50 jin because of this.
    The work of state farms has a great influence on the local farmers. If the farm work is done well, the farmers will actively imitate it; if the farm work is not done well, it will leave a bad impression on the farmers. It is hoped that Fenghua County Farm will accept these lessons, seriously improve its work, and truly play an exemplary role in agricultural production.

    奉化县农场应该改进工作
    中共浙江省奉化县委员会应德芳同志来信：“去年田里的稻子伏倒最多的是农场，今年田里稗草最多的又是农场。”这是奉化县的农民对县农场工作的批评。我在七月二十日参加县农场的早稻田间展览会时，就听到一些去参观的农民代表也提到这个问题。
    奉化县农场这种情况是怎样造成的呢？去年由于县农场盲目追肥，又不相信群众的实际经验，结果稻子秆子不粗壮，大风一吹即倒伏下去。今年这一方面虽然有了一些改进，但由于农场领导干部对工人缺乏政治思想教育，对田间工作也很少检查，有些工人耘田不细致，光把杂草除掉而未把稗草去掉，所以今年稗草特别多。据有些农民代表估计平均每亩田可能要因此而减产三十斤至五十斤左右。
    国家农场的工作，对当地农民群众影响很大。如果农场工作做得好，农民们会积极仿效；如果农场工作做得不好，就会在农民中留下不好的影响。希望奉化县农场接受这些教训，认真改进工作，真正在农业生产上起示范作用。
