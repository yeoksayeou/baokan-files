    Liang Wende Drilling Team Creates New Drilling Record
    The Liang Wende Drilling Team of the Yumen Mining Bureau set a new record of drilling 709.03 meters in one month with one drilling rig, exceeding the July drilling plan by 259.03 meters.
    The main reason for the Liang Wende Drilling Team's achievement was the resolute implementation of the Soviet experts' suggestions and the implementation of the "fast drilling method." Before drilling, they held a driller's meeting to carefully check all preparatory work, such as correcting the drilling rig, rotary table, crown block, diesel engine, and other drilling tools, and understanding the underground geological conditions. During drilling, they strengthened the coordination between drillers and pump house workers and actively responded to the call from superiors to "strive for every minute of drilling time." As a result, work efficiency was continuously improved. For example, the time taken by Liu Maolin's team to connect a single drill pipe was shortened from thirteen minutes to five minutes. The efficiency of Sheng Guobang's team in tripping in and out of the drill string at a depth of 628 meters was 81.08% higher than the efficiency of tripping in and out of the drill string at a depth of 126.72 meters.

    Two Major Fire Zones in Datong Coalfield Have Been Sealed
    The two largest fire zones in the Datong Coalfield, Majiliang and Hujiawan, have been sealed off. There were many kiln openings, cracks, and sinkholes around these two fire zones, and air often entered and exited, causing the coal seams to burn for a long time. This time, a total of 29 old kiln openings, three ground sinkholes totaling 10,000 cubic meters, five mountain cracks, and other small holes were sealed and blocked. To isolate the internal fire from the outside air, stone walls were first built on the old kiln openings, then filled with loess, and then compacted in layers. The sealed area is inspected daily by dedicated personnel, and any new gaps are blocked at any time. According to the gas analysis taken from the observation holes in the fire zone, the sealing project has begun to take effect. In the Hujiawan fire zone, which was completed in early July, the carbon dioxide gas has increased significantly, indicating that the internal fire has been greatly reduced.
    This sealing project started in mid-June and was completed in early August, one and a half months ahead of schedule. During the project, the workers also demonstrated a high degree of heroism and initiative, especially when sealing the exhaust kiln openings, everyone worked in high temperatures and thick smoke. Now the Datong Coalfield Fire Extinguishing Project Office is making every effort to build a fire wall between the loess ditch mine and the fire zone in the Majiliang area in order to surround the fire zone and protect the producing mines. This fire wall is expected to be completed next summer. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Another New-Type Thermal Power Plant Built in Northeast China
    In Northeast China, the main plant building of a new-type thermal power plant, covering an area of 150,000 square meters, officially started construction in early July. Soon, a thermal power plant with world-class equipment will stand tall on this endless vast grassland, and a new-style industrial city will be born around it.
    Every construction preparation work for this project is carried out in accordance with the advanced technical requirements of the Soviet Union, and the construction method is also fully mechanized. First, 460,000 cubic meters of earthwork will be completed using excavators, conveyors, and dump trucks. A large-scale sawmill has been built more than a mile away from the construction site, and a rebar assembly plant and a concrete factory will also begin work soon.
    Currently, a heated and tense atmosphere prevails on the construction site. Trucks, dump trucks, and cranes are driving into the site from all directions, and tractors, excavators, and conveyors are humming in every corner. The workers are full of confidence and a cheerful mood, vowing to engage in this great construction project at the fastest speed.
    Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant Successfully Trial-Produces New Hard-Seat Passenger Car
    The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant has successfully trial-produced a new hard-seat passenger car. The hard-seat passenger car is designed using modern science and technology according to travel needs. The car body is made of steel skin, and the car roof and sides are welded using the advanced Soviet electric welding method (without rivets), which is very strong and durable. The car is equipped with air blowers and electric fans. In winter, the air blowers discharge a large amount of heat from the exhaust pipes to increase the temperature inside the car. In summer, electric fans regulate the heat. The "backrests" and "seat cushions" are all meticulously crafted. The workers demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity in manufacturing the new passenger car. Lu Peikui, the leader of the copper workers' production team in the passenger car workshop, made a suggestion that successfully manufactured the most difficult component of the air blower, the "heat sink." Yu Jichang, an old worker in the car group, researched a set of fixtures for cutting felt, increasing production efficiency by more than two times, and improving quality from about 85% to 100%.
    China-Soviet Civil Aviation Company New Route from Dihua to Kashgar Will Officially Open
    In order to promote the political, economic, and cultural exchange between my country's border areas and the interior, the China-Soviet Civil Aviation Joint Stock Company has been actively planning to open a new route from Dihua to Kashgar (Shufu) via Turpan, Kuqa, and Aksu this year. Now that all the work has been prepared, it has been decided to officially open the route on September 1st, and the passenger and cargo transportation business for the new route will be handled at business offices in various places from now on.

    "Yihong" Tea in Hubei Province Has a Bumper Harvest
    The "Yihong" tea in the Yichang and Enshi special districts of western Hubei Province has a bumper harvest, with an increase in production of about 15% compared to last year. Wufengshan Township, Enshi County, produced only 277 dan of black tea last year, but this year it produced 360 dan, an increase of 29.72%. At the same time, the quality of "Yihong" tea has also greatly improved. Last year, first- and second-grade black tea accounted for only 40% of the total black tea production in the province, but this year it has reached more than 65%.
    Since the liberation of Hubei Province, the sales of black tea have continued to increase, and the state's purchase price of tea is reasonable, so the lives of farmers in the producing areas have been improved, their enthusiasm for production is high, and they are actively organizing and expanding tea gardens. Hufeng County alone has planted more than 800,000 new tea trees this year, and Xianfeng County has expanded tea gardens by more than 1,000 mu. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Grape Harvest in Turpan Basin
    The grapes in the Turpan Basin, a nationally famous producing area of white raisins, have had a bumper harvest. This year, the output of seedless white grapes can reach more than 3.4 million jin. In villages such as Grape Valley, Shahezi in Turpan County, and Tuyugou in Shanshan County, where grapes are abundant, Uyghur farmers are happily picking new grapes and drying raisins.
    In the past, farmers in the Turpan Basin believed that a good grape harvest one year would be followed by a poor harvest the next year. For example, after a good grape harvest last year, farmers were worried that this year's grapes would be in a "poor year." However, thanks to the active assistance of the People's Government this year, cooperatives in various places have timely lent out a large number of agricultural tools and fertilizers, and farmers in various places have also actively improved grape cultivation and management, generally applying fertilizer to grapes and pruning branches and vines. Therefore, this year's grapes in the Turpan Basin still had a bumper harvest.
    Coconuts, Coffee, and Pineapples on Hainan Island Are All Ripe
    Various tropical crops unique to China on Hainan Island have matured and are about to be on the market. Now, coconuts in Wenchang, Lingshui, Yaxian, Qiongdong, Wanning, and Dingan counties have matured in large quantities, and people of all ethnic groups are braving the scorching heat to climb high trees to pick coconuts. There were originally about 1,308,000 coconut trees on the island, and farmers have planted more than 300,000 more trees in the three years since liberation. This year's coconut production is expected to be higher than last year's. In addition to being available for people to eat, coconuts can also be used to squeeze coconut oil (an excellent raw material for making soap). The coffee in the island's 19 coffee gardens is also full of fruit, with each tree generally bearing more than 2,000 fruits, and the annual output of coffee beans is estimated to be more than 10,000 jin. In addition, delicious jackfruit has been harvested in large quantities. Sea buckthorn trees (the fruit can be used to squeeze oil) and betel nut trees are also full of fruit.

    大同煤田两个大火区已被密闭
    大同煤田马脊梁、胡家湾两个最大的火区已经被密闭起来。这两个火区的四周窑口和裂缝、陷坑等很多，空气时常出入，使得煤层燃烧长期不熄。这次一共封闭和堵塞了二十九个旧窑口，三个加起来有一万公方大的地面陷坑，五道山间裂缝以及其他的小洞等。为了使内部的火和外面空气隔绝，旧窑口上都先砌好石墙，再填上黄土，然后分层打结实。封闭地区，每天有专人检查，一发现有新的空隙就随时堵上。现在根据从火区观察孔中取出的气体分析看来，密闭工程已开始发生作用，七月初密闭完工的胡家湾火区内，二氧化碳气体有显著增加，这表明内部的火势已经大减。
    这次密闭工程从六月中旬开始，到八月初全部完工，比预定计划提早了一个半月完成。在工程进行中，职工们还表现了高度的英勇积极的精神，特别是在密闭出风窑口时，大家都在高温中冒着浓烟工作。现在大同煤田消火工程处正在全力修筑马脊梁区的黄土沟矿和火区之间的一道防火墙，以便包围火区，保护正在生产的矿井。这道防火墙预计在明年夏季完成。    （新华社）
    东北又新建一座新型火电站
    在东北，一个占地十五万平方公尺的新型火电站的主厂房工程于七月上旬正式开工了。不久，这一望无际的广阔草原上，就将耸立起一座具有世界第一流设备的火电站，在它的四周，也将诞生一个新式的工业城市。
    这一工程的每一项施工准备工作，都是按照苏联的先进技术要求进行的，工程的施工方法也是全部机械化。首先，四十六万立方公尺的土方工程就将利用掘土机、输土机和自卸车来完成。在离工地一里多远的地方，一个规模宏大的锯木厂已经建成，钢筋装配厂、混凝土工厂也都即将开始工作。
    目前，工地上出现一片热烈紧张的气氛，汽车、自卸车、吊车纷纷从各个方向驶进现场，拖拉机、掘土机和输土机在各个角落轧轧地轰鸣。工人们充满了信心和愉快的心情，保证要以最快速度从事这项伟大的建设工程。
    大连机车车辆制造厂试制硬席新客车成功
    大连机车车辆制造工厂试制硬席新客车成功。硬席新客车车厢是采取近代科学技术，根据旅行的需要设计成的。车厢是钢皮的，车棚和车体侧面是采用苏联的先进电焊法焊成（不用铆钉），非常坚固耐久，车厢内部装有送风机和电扇，冬季里，有送风机由排气筒排出大量的暖气，增加车内的温度；夏季里，有电扇调解闷热。“靠背”“座席垫子”都是精工细作的。工人们在制造新客车时发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，客车车间铜工班生产组长卢培奎提了一个建议，把最难做的送风机部件“散热片”制造成功了；对车组老工人于继昌研究出一套割毛毡的胎具，提高生产效率两倍多，质量由百分之八十五左右提高到百分之百。
    中苏民航公司新辟迪化—喀什航线将正式开航
    中苏民用航空股份公司为促进我国边疆与内地的政治、经济、文化交流，今年起积极筹划开辟由迪化经吐鲁番，库车，阿克苏至喀什（疏附）的新航线；现各项工作业已准备就绪，决定自九月一日起正式开航，并自即日起开始在各地营业处办理新航线的客货运输业务。

    湖北省“宜红”茶丰收
    湖北省西部宜昌、恩施专区一带的“宜红”茶丰收，产量比去年提高了百分之十五左右。恩施县伍峰山乡去年只生产了二百七十七担红茶，今年生产了三百六十担，增产百分之二十九点七二。同时，
    “宜红”茶的质量也大大提高。去年生产的一、二级红茶只占全省红茶总产量的百分之四十，今年已占到百分之六十五以上。
    湖北省解放以来，红茶销路不断增加，加以国家收购茶叶价格合理，因此产地农民生活得到改善，生产情绪很高，积极整理和扩大茶园，仅鹤峰县今年新植茶树即达八十多万株，咸丰县扩大茶园一千多亩。    （新华社）
    吐鲁番盆地葡萄丰收
    全国著名的白葡萄干产地——吐鲁番盆地的葡萄获得丰收。今年无核白葡萄的产量可达三百四十万斤以上。在吐鲁番县的葡萄沟、沙河子和鄯善县的吐峪沟等盛产葡萄的村庄里，维吾尔族农民都欢乐地摘收新葡萄，晾制葡萄干。
    吐鲁番盆地的农民过去都认为葡萄丰收一年就要歉收一年，比如去年葡萄获得丰收，农民都顾虑到今年的葡萄就要轮到“歉年”了，但由于今年人民政府的积极扶助，各地合作社及时贷放了大批农具和肥料，各地农民也积极改进葡萄的作务和管理，普遍给葡萄施肥，修剪枝藤。所以今年吐鲁番盆地的葡萄仍然得到了丰收。
    海南岛椰子咖啡菠萝都已成熟
    海南岛的多种国内特有的热带作物都已成熟，即将上市。现在，文昌、陵水、崖县、琼东、万宁、定安六县的椰子已大量成熟，各族人民正冒着酷热的天气爬上高高的树上采摘椰子。全岛原有椰子树约一百三十万八千多株，解放后三年来农民们又增植了三十多万株。今年椰子可比去年增产。椰子除可供人民食用外，还可榨制椰油（制肥皂用的优良原料）。全岛十九个咖啡园的咖啡也已结实累累，每株树一般结果二千多个，估计年产咖啡豆在一万斤以上。此外，可口的菠萝蜜已大量采摘。海棠树（果实可以榨油）和槟榔树也结实累累。
