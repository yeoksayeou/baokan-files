    How to Identify Iron Ore?
    Common iron ores include magnetite, hematite, limonite, and siderite.
    Magnetite is the best raw material for steelmaking. One hundred catties of pure magnetite ore contains about seventy-two catties of iron. Its color is steel gray-black, it is very hard, and it is magnetic. After breaking the ore with a hammer, its surface shows uneven angular shapes. The ore can scratch black streaks on unglazed porcelain.
    Hematite is also a major raw material for steelmaking, with about seventy catties of iron per hundred catties of pure ore. Its color ranges from reddish-red to liver-colored, and also brown-black; but after pulverizing, it all turns red, and it is not easy to wash off when it stains clothes. The structure of hematite ore can be like fish roe, like peas and soybeans, like soil, or like broad beans. Hematite ore is not as hard and brittle as magnetite ore, and it can scratch red streaks on unglazed porcelain. There is also a type of specular hematite, with the same composition as hematite, but it is steel gray and crystallized into flakes, with a brilliant luster, as bright as a mirror. Specular hematite does not exist independently in large quantities, and its economic value is not great.
    Limonite is slightly inferior to magnetite and hematite in iron content, with a maximum of about sixty catties of iron per hundred catties of pure ore; and the ore often contains more mud and sand, so the iron content of such ore is even lower. The color of limonite is brown or black-brown, and the ore can be layered or in irregular sizes (like grapes, sweet potatoes, or potatoes). It can scratch yellowish-brown or brown streaks on unglazed porcelain. Some limonite is formed by the action of groundwater, carbonic acid, and organic acids on pyrite (the main raw material for sulfur refining, its properties and shape, etc., were introduced in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on June 26th), and thus has crystal shapes like pyrite. This is called "pseudomorph." The "pseudomorph" of limonite is cubic, dark brown in color, and each face has parallel stripes, and the stripes on one face are perpendicular to the stripes on its adjacent face.
    Siderite ore generally contains only about thirty catties of iron per hundred catties, and even the purest does not exceed forty-eight catties. Its shape is usually like a cake, granular, grape-like, etc.; the color is gray and light yellow-gray, and also light brown-red. It shows white or light yellow streaks when scratched on unglazed porcelain. If you drop one or two drops of hydrochloric acid on the ore, bubbles (carbon dioxide) will immediately form.
    A common characteristic of the above four types of iron ore is that they are much heavier than ordinary stones.
    When we pan for gold in rivers or dig wells, or work on river valleys or hillsides, we may find fragments of the above four types of ore. At this time, the distance to the outcrop of the primary iron ore can be inferred from the size of the ore block. If the ore is large and angular, it indicates that this place is very close to the outcrop; if the ore is small and round, it indicates that the outcrop is far away from here. When tracing the traces of this ore, if the ore fragments become more and more numerous and larger, it indicates that you are gradually getting closer to the outcrop of the ore; if the ore fragments become less and less, you should look in the opposite direction.

    怎样识别铁矿？
    铁矿常见的有磁铁矿、赤铁矿、褐铁矿、菱铁矿等。
    磁铁矿是炼钢铁的最好原料，一百斤纯磁铁矿石约含铁七十二斤。它的颜色为钢灰黑色，性质很坚硬，有磁性，用铁锤把矿石打破后，它的表面呈现凹凸不平的棱角状。矿石在毛瓷板（没有釉的瓷板）上可以刻划出黑色的条痕。
    赤铁矿也是炼钢铁的一种主要原料，每百斤纯矿石含铁量约为七十斤。它的颜色由赤红色到像猪肝色的都有，也有棕黑色的；但粉碎后都变红色，染到衣服上很不易洗掉。赤铁矿石的结构有像鱼卵状的，有像豌豆和黄豆状的，有像泥土状的，也有像蚕豆状的。赤铁矿矿石不如磁铁矿矿石硬而脆，在毛瓷板上可以刻划出红色的条痕。还有一种镜铁矿，成分与赤铁矿相同，但是钢灰色，结晶成片状，光泽灿烂，明亮如镜。镜铁矿没有独立而大量存在的，经济价值不大。
    褐铁矿在铁质上比磁铁矿和赤铁矿稍次，每百斤纯矿石含铁最多到六十斤左右；且矿中常含较多的泥砂，这样的矿石含铁量就更少。褐铁矿的颜色是褐色或黑褐色，矿石有层状的，也有不规则的大小块状的（像葡萄、地瓜或土豆）。它在毛瓷板上可以刻划出黄褐色或褐色的条痕。有一些褐铁矿是由黄铁矿（炼硫的主要原料，它的性质、形状等在六月二十六日“读者来信摘要”栏已作了介绍。）受地下水、碳酸和有机酸的作用变化而成的，因而像黄铁矿那样但是晶形的，这叫做“假晶”。褐铁矿的“假晶”是立方体形，颜色深褐，每个面上都有平行条纹，而且一个面上的条纹与其相邻面上的条纹都互相垂直。
    菱铁矿的矿石每百斤一般只含铁三十多斤，最纯的也不超过四十八斤。它的形状通常是饼块状、粒状、葡萄状等；颜色有灰色和淡黄带灰色的，也有淡褐带红色的。它在毛瓷板上刻划时呈白色或淡黄色的条痕。若在矿石上滴上一两点盐酸，马上发生气泡（二氧化碳）。
    以上四种铁矿石的共同特点是：比一般的石头要重得多。
    我们在淘河、挖井时，在河谷或山坡工作时，都可能发现上述四种矿石的碎块。这时，根据矿石块的大小等就可以推断出原生铁矿露头的远近。如果矿石大而带有棱角，这说明此地离露头很近；如果矿石小而圆，则说明露头离此很远。在追寻这种矿石的踪迹时，如果矿石碎块越来越多、越大，就说明离矿石的露头渐渐近了；如果矿石碎块越来越少，那就应该向相反的方向去找。
