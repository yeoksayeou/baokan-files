Reader's Letters - Abstracts

    Strengthening Planning in Translation Work

    Editor's Note: In the following abstracts of letters, readers reflect on certain wasteful phenomena in the current translation work, and put forward suggestions on strengthening the planning of translation work. This is a problem worthy of attention.

    In order to make the existing translation force more effective, appropriate division of labor and necessary liaison should be carried out between translation agencies to strengthen the planning of translation work, reduce work duplication and waste of manpower, so as to improve the quality of translations. In terms of translation work carried out by industrial departments for production or construction needs, industrial leading bodies should take appropriate measures to improve this work. The situation reflected and the suggestions put forward by comrades Shen Rongjun and Sun Yanmin of the Angang Design Institute can be used as a reference. In general translation and publishing work, the General Administration of Publications has resumed the publication of "Translation Bulletin" in June this year, so that translators can understand each other's work and exchange experience, so as to promote the planning of translation work; translation agencies and publishing houses should also report their annual or quarterly translation and publishing plans to the General Administration of Publications for review and unified adjustment; individual translators should preferably contact the publishing house before translating a book, and contact the General Administration of Publications through the publishing house to avoid re-translation.

    The phenomenon of decentralization and waste of manpower in the translation work of industrial departments should be changed

    Letter from Shen Rongjun and Sun Yanmin of the Angang Design Institute Translation Department: In the current translation work of industrial departments, how to ensure the quality of engineering translations and the rational use of existing Russian translation cadres is an urgent problem to be solved.

    There are currently more than 300 translators in Angang. Because the Translation Department was established earlier, it has formulated some translation (translation), proofreading rules, and accumulated certain experience in its work; generally speaking, the quality of translating Soviet engineering specifications and drawings can be guaranteed. However, the situation in other brother factories and mines is not exactly the same. The conditions of some factories and mines translation institutions are very poor: on the one hand, there are few translation cadres, so the division of labor cannot be too detailed, and many translation cadres have only studied Russian for two years, and do not have considerable technical knowledge, or even did not learn mathematics and physics in middle school; on the other hand, the translation tasks are not only very heavy, but also often have a rush nature, and are not allowed to be carefully considered. In the case of few cadres, heavy tasks and short time, the things they translate cannot guarantee a certain quality.

    However, we have found that there are also some manpower waste phenomena in the current translation work of industrial departments. Taking the Northeast as an example, there are many factories and mines in the industrial sector, and the leadership systems are different; however, the content of many construction designs of each factory and mine is basically the same, for example, the basic construction of each factory and mine must first be civil engineering, followed by mechanical parts installation, power systems, etc. Since each factory and mine has its own translation unit, translation work often overlaps because several factories and mines are carrying out similar projects at the same time. At the same time, because each unit has a translation agency, it is necessary to extract a certain number of translators to take on administrative work, and cannot devote all their energy to translation work.

    In order to solve the above problems, we suggest that: it is best to concentrate the existing translators in the industrial sector in the country or large administrative regions, and assign them to a kind of work to master professional Russian and improve technical knowledge. This can not only rationally use translators and avoid waste of manpower; but also lay a good foundation for ensuring the quality of translation. We hope that the higher-level leading organs will consider this issue.

    Duplication of translation work should be avoided

    Letter from Cai Deliang of the Compilation and Translation Office of the August 1st Agricultural College in Dihua: This year, comrades in our office translated about ten books on Soviet biological science and technology, but now we know that three of them have been re-translated. For example, we translated part of the books "Sheep Husbandry" and "Botany", and later received a notice from the Central Higher Education Department saying that someone had already translated them and asked us to stop translating them. Another book, "Brief Instructions for the Use of the Dete-54 Tractor", we only knew that it had already been published and printed by the "Agricultural Machinery Bulletin" after we finished translating and proofreading it. This situation has wasted a lot of manpower and time. Therefore, I hope that the General Administration of Publications can strengthen the leadership of translation work, and use appropriate methods to organize the connection between translation units and translators, so that they can understand each other's work and avoid duplication and waste in translation, and strengthen the planning of translation work.

    The errors in the printing of the book "Mechanical Parts Handbook" are very serious

    Letter from Guo Zhipei and Yang Zengtao, teachers of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Dalian Institute of Technology: Last year, eleven comrades of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of our college collectively translated a Soviet "Mechanical Parts Handbook", which was handed over to the Education Department of the Central Heavy Industry Department by the Teaching Affairs Section of our college for printing and publishing. The "Public Education Printing Factory" responsible for printing the book sent us the sample after typesetting. We found that the printing errors in the sample were very serious, and suggested that they should proofread carefully. However, they did not adopt the translator's opinion and rashly printed 5,000 copies, and instructed the translator to compile an errata list. The printing errors in the book are staggering, and if it is to be compiled into an errata list, it will account for more than one-half of the total number of pages in the book; and many of the views are skewed and the printing is blurred, and the arrangement of views and captions, symbols, etc. are very inconvenient for readers. After we proofread half of the book, we notified them to immediately stop the printing and distribution of this edition; but the publisher ignored the translator's opinion and arbitrarily handed this handbook to the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore for sale. We only learned about this situation after readers who bought the book notified us. We believe that the attitude of the Education Department of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Public Education Printing Factory, which are responsible for publishing and printing, is extremely wrong and irresponsible to readers, and we hope that they will quickly conduct an inspection of this and take timely measures to remedy it.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    加强翻译工作中的计划性
    编者按：在下面摘要发表的几封来信中，读者反映了目前翻译工作中某些浪费人力的现象，并提出了关于加强翻译工作计划性的建议。这是一个值得注意的问题。
    为了使现有的翻译力量更有效地发挥其效能，各翻译机构之间应该进行适当的分工和必要的联系，以加强翻译工作的计划性，减少工作重复、人力浪费的现象，从而提高译品的质量。在工业部门为生产或建设所需要而进行的翻译工作方面，各工业领导机关应该采取适当办法改进这个工作。鞍钢设计处沈荣钧、孙延珉两同志来信中反映的情况和提出的建议可供参考。在一般翻译出版工作方面，出版总署在今年六月已恢复出版“翻译通报”，使翻译工作者内部能够互相了解工作情况和交流经验，以推动翻译工作的计划化；各翻译机构和出版社亦应将年度或季度的翻译出版计划报送出版总署，以便出版总署审核和统一调整；翻译工作者个人在译书前最好先和出版社接洽，并通过出版社和出版总署联系，以避免重译现象。
    工业部门的翻译工作中应改变分散浪费人力的现象
    鞍钢设计处翻译科沈荣钧、孙延珉来信：在目前工业部门的翻译工作中，如何保证工程译品的质量以及合理使用现有的俄文翻译干部是迫切需要解决的问题。
    鞍钢的翻译人员目前有三百余人。因为翻译科设立较早，在工作中制定了一些翻译（笔译）、校对的规程，积累了一定的经验；一般来说，翻译苏联工程说明书、图纸可以保证质量。但是其他兄弟厂矿的情况却不完全相同。有些厂矿翻译机构的条件就很差：一方面，翻译干部少，分工就不可能太细致，而很多的翻译干部只学了两年俄文，并且没有相当的技术知识，甚至中学的数理都没学过；另一方面，翻译任务不但十分繁重，而且常带有突击性质，不允许细细琢磨。在干部少、任务重、时间短的情况下，他们译出来的东西就不可能保证一定的质量。
    但是，我们发现目前工业部门的翻译工作中也有着某些人力浪费的现象。以东北来说，工业部门的厂矿很多，领导系统不一；但各厂矿很多施工设计的内容基本上是一致的，例如各厂矿基本建设中首先一定是土建工程，其次是机件安装、动力系统等。由于各厂矿都分别设有翻译单位，因此常常好几处厂矿因同时进行类似的工程而使翻译工作发生重复。同时，因为各单位都设有翻译机构，这样就需要抽出一定的翻译工作者担任行政工作，不能以全部的精力从事翻译工作。
    为了解决以上问题，我们建议：最好在全国或大行政区范围内将工业部门现有的翻译工作者集中使用，分别派到一种工种中去掌握专业俄文，提高技术知识。这样不但可以合理使用翻译人员，避免人力的浪费；同时也为保证翻译质量打下良好的基础。这个问题，希望上级领导机关考虑。
    应避免翻译工作的重复现象
    迪化八一农学院教务处编译室蔡德梁来信：我室同志今年翻译了十本左右苏联生物科学技术方面的书籍，但是现在知道，重译的已有三本。如“养羊学”、“植物学”两书，我们译了一部分，后来收到中央高等教育部的通知说有人已翻译了，叫我们停译。另一本“德特—五四拖拉机运用简要说明书”，我们在译完校对时才知道已经早由“农机通报”社出版印行了。这种情况，使我们浪费了很大的人力和时间。因此，我希望出版总署能加强对翻译工作的领导，用适当方法组织各翻译单位和翻译工作者之间的联系，使他们互相了解工作情况，以避免翻译中的重复浪费现象，加强翻译工作中的计划性。
    “机械零件手册”一书印刷中的错误非常严重
    大连工学院机械系教员郭志佩、杨曾焘来信：去年我院机械系十一位同志集体翻译了一本苏联的“机械零件手册”，由我院教务科交给中央重工业部教育司印刷出版。负责印刷该书的“公教印刷厂”排好样本后，就送给我们。我们发现样本中印刷的错误非常严重，就建议他们应该仔细校对。但他们却不采纳译者的意见，冒然印出五千本，并嘱译者编制勘误表。该书印刷的错误多得惊人，如果要编成勘误表的话，要占全书总页数的二分之一以上；而且其中许多视图歪斜不正和印刷模糊，视图排列和图注、符号等错误都是对读者很不便的。我们校对了全书一半之后，便通知他们立即停止这版的印刷和发行；但出版者竟不顾译者的意见，擅自将这本手册交到东北新华书店出售。这一情况，直到购得此书的读者通知我们后我们才知道。我们认为：负责出版、印刷的重工业部教育司和公教印刷厂这种对读者不负责任的态度是极端错误的，希望他们迅速对此进行检查并及时设法补救。
