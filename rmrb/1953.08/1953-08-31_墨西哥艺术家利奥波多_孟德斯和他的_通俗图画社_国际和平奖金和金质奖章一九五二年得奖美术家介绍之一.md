    Leopoldo Méndez, winner of the World Peace Council's International Peace Prize in 1952, was born in Mexico City in 1902. His father was a shoemaker, and his mother was a rural woman. From 1920 to 1922, he studied at the San Carlos Academy of Fine Arts, and later entered the Chimalistac Painting School. After that, he devoted himself to the people's art and eventually became an outstanding Mexican artist. The name of Leopoldo Méndez is inseparable from the activities of the "People's Graphic Workshop," which he led. He is the founder and leader of this finest group of woodcut artists in Mexico—the "People's Graphic Workshop."

    The "People's Graphic Workshop" was newly established in 1937, when the League of Revolutionary Writers and Artists—"LEAR"—was dissolved. With the help and encouragement of the painter Siqueiros, and at the initiative of Méndez, Pablo O'Higgins (an American who completely sided with the Mexican people), and Luis Arenal, it became a new art creation center. When it was founded, the workshop had only a five-sentence declaration and an old lithographic press. The main idea of the declaration was: We produce for progress. The words on the printing press were: "Made in Paris in 1871." From that time on, the work of the "People's Graphic Workshop" has continued to develop. Now the workshop has sixteen very talented artists.

    The first task of the "People's Graphic Workshop" after its establishment was to create promotional posters in 1937 to celebrate the founding of the Mexican Confederation of Labor. Later, it also carried out propaganda for the Spanish Republic. The members also hand-printed 32,000 propaganda posters for the anti-fascist "German Cultural Alliance." At the same time, they designed and drew many large-scale pictures for domestic political gatherings.

    During World War II, the activities of the workshop unfolded more significantly. Under the slogan of "The Soviet Front is our first line of defense," a broad propaganda campaign was carried out. The most important work after the war was an 85-page album, "Engravings of the Mexican Revolution," which depicted the entire history of the Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1920. After the architect Hannes Meyer joined the workshop, he established the workshop's publishing institution, which printed a collection of all the workshop's works—"Collection of the Mexican People's Graphic Workshop." Because they had their own publishing institution, they contributed even more to using pictures for political propaganda.

    Leopoldo Méndez has extremely deep national feelings. He hates American imperialism and its "culture," and he despises the formalist schools of Paris. He is a realist artist who is faithful to Mexican traditions. His works display a high degree of national character, directly inheriting the tradition of the people's woodcut artist José Guadalupe Posada from the last century. He published several woodcut pamphlets, including "In the Name of Jesus," which was based on the incident of the murder of school teacher Jaris Fleif by fascist bandits disguised under the guise of Catholicism. These pamphlets were published by the Mexican Ministry of Education in 1939. In 1943, the Mexican Engraving Society published "Twenty-Five Prints by Leopoldo Méndez." He also drew illustrations for several books. His illustrations for "Melodic Events in an Unreasonable World" won the highest prize for book illustration in Mexico in 1945. He also engraved ten illustrations for the film "Rio Escondido." In addition, he painted some murals. But his central activity is woodcuts.

    Leopoldo Méndez has a strong character and extraordinary talent. Each of his paintings is created after careful and meticulous conception. His life is very simple. He lives in a working-class district far from the city center. His residence is a simple little house with very little furniture. His usual clothes are exactly the same as those of workers.

    Because of his dedication to revolutionary literary and artistic work, he has become the undisputed representative of this group of artists who are loved by the Mexican people, the Latin American people, and the people of the world.

    Since he attended the Wroclaw Peace Congress as a representative of Mexico, he has frequently participated in the work of the peace movement. He was even arrested for urging people to sign the Stockholm Appeal. He uses his name and the prestige of his works to fully support the peace movement. He and all the works of the "People's Graphic Workshop" he leads are a testament to the cause of peace.

    墨西哥艺术家利奥波多·孟德斯和他的“通俗图画社”
    ——国际和平奖金和金质奖章一九五二年得奖美术家介绍之一
    世界和平理事会国际和平奖金一九五二年得奖者利奥波多·孟德斯，一九○二年生于墨西哥城，父亲是鞋匠，母亲是农村妇女。一九二○年至一九二二年在圣加洛斯美术学院学习，后进契玛里斯达绘画学校，此后便一直从事人民艺术事业，终于成为墨西哥杰出的艺术家。利奥波多·孟德斯的名字是和他所领导的“通俗图画社”的活动分不开的。他就是这个墨西哥最优秀的木刻家团体——“通俗图画社”的创始人和领导人。
    “通俗图画社”是在一九三七年正当革命文艺工作者同盟——“里尔”被解散的时候，由于画家斯盖罗斯的帮助和鼓舞，并经孟德斯、巴布罗·奥希金斯（一位完全站到墨西哥人民这方面来的美国人）和路易·阿伦纳的倡议，新建立起来的一个艺术创作中心。这个画社在成立时只有一个五句话的宣言和一部老式石印机。宣言的主要意思是：我们为了进步而生产。印刷机上的字却是：“一八七一年在巴黎制造”。从这时起，“通俗图画社”的工作便不断发展起来。现在这个画社拥有十六位很有才能的艺术家。
    “通俗图画社”成立后的第一件工作是一九三七年为庆祝墨西哥工人联合会的成立而作的宣传画，其后也曾为西班牙共和国进行过宣传。社员们又为反法西斯的“德意志文化联盟”亲手印制了三万二千张宣传画。同时也为国内政治性的集会设计绘制了许多巨幅的图画。
    第二次世界大战期间，画社的活动更显著地展开了，在“苏联的阵线便是我们的第一道防线”的口号下，进行了广泛的宣传运动。战后最重要的一部作品，是一本八十五页的画册“墨西哥革命的版画”，它绘出了自一九一○年到一九二○年的墨西哥革命的全部历史。建筑家海涅斯·迈耶加入了画社之后，又建立了画社的出版机构，印行了画社全部作品的集子——“墨西哥通俗图画社集”。因为有了自己的出版机构，他们贡献出更大的力量，用图画来做政治宣传的工作。
    利奥波多·孟德斯有着极其深厚的民族情感，他痛恨美帝国主义和它的“文化”，他轻视巴黎的形式主义学派。他是一位忠实于墨西哥传统的现实主义的艺术家。他的作品发挥了高度的民族性，直接继承了上一世纪人民木刻家何塞·瓜达鹿白·巴沙都的传统。他出版了几本木刻小册，其中“以耶稣的名义”，是以反对披着天主教外衣的法西斯匪徒杀害雅里斯弗的小学教员事件为题材的。这些小册是由墨西哥教育部在一九三九年出版的。一九四三年又由墨西哥版画社出版了“利奥波多·孟德斯印版画二十五幅”。他还画了几本书的插图。他的“一个不合理的世界中旋律上的事件”插图曾获得墨西哥一九四五年书本插图最优等奖。他还为影片“爱斯恭地多河”镂刻了十幅插图。此外，他还画了一些壁画。可是他的中心活动是木刻。
    利奥波多·孟德斯有着坚强的性格和卓越的天才，他的每一幅画都是经过精心、细致的构思而作成的。他的生活很简朴，他住在一个远离城市中心的工人区里，他的住所是一间简陋的小房子，房子里面只有极少的家具，他平日的服装和工人的服装完全一样。
    由于他热心于革命的文艺工作，他成为这个为墨西哥人民、拉丁美洲人民以及全世界人民所爱戴的艺术家团体无可置疑的代表。
    自从他以墨西哥代表的资格出席佛罗兹拉夫和平大会以来，他经常参加和平运动的工作，他甚至因为鼓动人们在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名而被拘捕。他用他的名字和他作品的威信，全力支持和平运动。他和他所领导的“通俗图画社”的全部作品，就是和平事业的见证。
