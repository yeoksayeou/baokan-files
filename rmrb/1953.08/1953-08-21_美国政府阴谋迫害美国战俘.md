    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 20th: The New York "Daily Worker" reported on the 17th that repatriated American POWs may be subjected to fascist persecution by the US government. The paper pointed out: US Attorney General Herbert Brownell said in Los Angeles on the 15th that some American POWs, who were secretly reported as "progressives," may be charged with treason. He also said that these American POWs "may either be court-martialed or prosecuted by the judicial department."

    The paper pointed out: News has it that American officers have already dispatched professional intelligence personnel and spies to the batches of repatriated POWs, and many POWs will be monitored. Brownell's statement after these reports confirms that the Eisenhower government will use more severe punitive measures to replace its "brainwashing" plan.

    美国政府阴谋迫害美国战俘
    【新华社柏林二十日电】纽约“工人日报”十七日报道：遣返的美国战俘可能受到美国政府的法西斯迫害。该报指出：美国司法部部长赫伯特·布朗纳尔十五日在洛杉矶说，某些被密告为“进步分子”的美国战俘可能被控犯叛国罪。他又说，这些美国战俘“可能或受军法审判或被司法部门起诉”。
    该报指出：有消息说，美国军官已经派遣职业的情报人员和间谍到一批一批遣返的战俘中去，而且许多战俘将受到监视，布朗纳尔在这些消息之后发表的声明，证实了艾森豪威尔政府将用更厉害的惩罚手段来代替它的“洗脑子”的计划。
