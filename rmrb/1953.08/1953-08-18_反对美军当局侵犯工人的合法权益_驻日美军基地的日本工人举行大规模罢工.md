Xinhua News Agency, August 13th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese workers employed at US military bases throughout Japan, in order to oppose the US military authorities' restrictions on their union activities and a draft labor contract that infringes upon their legitimate rights, began a 48-hour protest strike simultaneously on the 12th. This is the largest strike ever held by Japanese workers employed by the US military.

A total of 150,000 people participated in the strike, accounting for the vast majority of Japanese workers at US military bases. They mainly belong to the All Japan Garrison Forces Labor Union and the National Garrison Forces Labor Union of Japan. In addition, some workers who do not belong to the above two labor unions also participated in the strike.

The day before the general strike began, more than 5,000 Japanese workers employed at the Tachikawa US Air Force Base first held a 24-hour strike to protest the US military's recent unjustified dismissal of hundreds of Japanese workers at the base.

Both the US military authorities and the Yoshida government have tried their best to suppress the strike. Before the workers even entered the general strike, the Yoshida government's Ministry of Labor hurriedly submitted many demands to the two garrison workers' unions on the 11th to restrict strike actions, in order to curry favor with its American masters. On the first day of the general strike (August 12), the US military authorities hypocritically stated that the US military would not take "retaliatory measures" against the workers' major strike. However, on the same day, when workers at the US military base in Yokota, near Tokyo, were on strike, US soldiers guarding the base opened fire on the demonstrating workers, injuring four striking workers. At the same time, according to the National Local Police Headquarters of Japan, there were a total of eight incidents of US military interference with the workers' strike on the 12th, and a number of workers were injured.

Japanese workers are extremely angry at the US military's bloody suppression. The National Garrison Forces Labor Union of Japan has already lodged a strong protest with the Yoshida government regarding this incident.

### 反对美军当局侵犯工人的合法权益  驻日美军基地的日本工人举行大规模罢工

    反对美军当局侵犯工人的合法权益
    驻日美军基地的日本工人举行大规模罢工
    【新华社十三日讯】东京消息：在日本各地美国军事基地中工作的日本工人，为了反对美军当局限制他们进行工会活动和合法权益的劳工合同草案，从十二日开始，同时举行四十八小时的抗议罢工。这是美军雇用的日本工人举行的规模最大的一次罢工。
    参加这次罢工的共有十五万人，占美军基地日本工人的绝大部分。他们主要属于日本全国驻军工会和全日本驻军工会，此外还有一些不属于上述两个工会的工人也一同参加了罢工。
    在这次总罢工开始的前一天，在立川美国空军基地工作的五千多名日本工人首先举行了一次二十四小时的罢工，抗议美军最近无理解雇该基地数百名日本工人。
    美军当局和吉田政府都竭力想压制这次罢工。在工人还未进入总罢工以前，吉田政府劳动省就慌忙在十一日向两个驻军工人的工会提出了许多限制罢工行动的要求，以向美国主子讨好。总罢工开始的第一天（十二日），美军当局曾经伪善地表示：美军对于工人的这次大罢工将不采取“报复措施”。但是，就在同一天，当东京附近横田美军基地的工人正在进行罢工时，看守该基地的美军士兵竟向示威的工人开枪射击，结果击伤了四名罢工的工人。同时，据日本国家地方警察本部说，在十二日的罢工中，美军干涉工人罢工的事件一共有八起，有若干工人受了伤。
    日本工人对美军的血腥镇压感到十分愤怒。日本全国驻军工会已经就这事件向吉田政府提出了强硬的抗议。
