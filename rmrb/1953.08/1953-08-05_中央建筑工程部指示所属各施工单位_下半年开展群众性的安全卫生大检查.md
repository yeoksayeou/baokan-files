The Central Ministry of Construction Engineering issued instructions on July 27th, requiring all subordinate construction units to conduct a mass safety and health inspection in the second half of this year.

The instructions pointed out: Construction has now entered the third quarter, and construction tasks will be more arduous and heavy. In order to promptly correct the shortcomings in safety technology and labor protection work that existed in construction enterprises in the past, all units must effectively strengthen technical safety and labor protection work, establish necessary systems of responsibility, and avoid further accidents to ensure the completion of this year's construction tasks and the safety of employees.

The instructions specified the scope and content of this major inspection. In terms of labor protection organization and rules, it is necessary to check whether labor protection organizations have been established and improved, and whether there are safe operating procedures and systems. In terms of technical operations and safety equipment, priority should be given to checking the safety equipment of earthwork, foundation engineering, and high-altitude operations; then check the equipment, use, maintenance, and protective equipment distribution of electrical and mechanical equipment, as well as material stacking, waste disposal, and the storage of explosive, flammable, and toxic materials, and fire protection equipment. In terms of environmental hygiene, it is necessary to check whether the workers' sheds are strong, leak-proof, and not crowded; it is also necessary to check the equipment and management of kitchens and canteens, the disinfection and washing of cooking utensils, the health education of cooks, and the setting and cleaning of toilets.

The instructions require all construction units to eliminate major accidents and greatly reduce general accidents in terms of safety technology through this major inspection; in terms of health, it is required to strengthen preventive work and reduce the incidence of employee diseases. All employees should establish the idea of ​​equal importance to production and safety, thereby establishing and improving labor protection organizations, formulating and revising rules and regulations, and resolving urgent problems that need to be solved separately under possible conditions. Problems that cannot be solved immediately should be made into a phased solution plan, and specific personnel should be responsible for solving them.

The instructions finally pointed out that the organization and leadership of this major inspection should be led by the Bureau of Construction Engineering, together with the Construction Trade Union and other relevant departments, to jointly organize an inspection committee to be responsible for the planning, deployment, inspection, and summary of the inspection work. All construction units should also organize inspection committees (absorbing technical, health, fire protection, and skilled workers) to be responsible for leading the inspection work of the unit.
