    CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee Department of Heavy Industry
    Deploys Work on Compiling and Implementing Operation Plans

    On August 13th, the Department of Heavy Industry of the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee convened a meeting of Party member leading cadres from state-owned and joint state-private heavy industrial factories in Shanghai, deploying the focus of work for the second half of the year to be the compilation and implementation of operation plans.

    At the meeting, Yang Shifa, Director of the Department of Heavy Industry of the Municipal Committee, put forward different requirements based on the different work foundations and production conditions of each factory, and emphasized that after discussing the national plan, in addition to formulating a reward system, each factory should focus on compiling and implementing operation plans. In particular, it is necessary to strengthen the operation plans of workshops and work sections, and specifically stipulate the monthly, weekly, and daily progress of groups and individuals. Each factory should concentrate its efforts when compiling the September operation plan, mobilize the masses, earnestly compile according to the prescribed procedures, and strengthen inspection and supervision to ensure the system is maintained. When compiling the operation plan, it should progress from rough to detailed, from simple to complex, first focusing on strengthening the operation plans of the main workshops, studying the problems in the compilation, analyzing the factors that disrupt the operation plan, and then gradually extending to other workshops.

    In order to ensure the implementation of the operation plan, each factory also needs to establish and strengthen scheduling work, regularly supervise and inspect the implementation of the operation plan, and proactively discover and solve problems under the established operation plan, especially the balance work between the relevant workshops and functional departments should be scheduled in a timely manner. At the same time, in the implementation of the operation plan, it is necessary to establish and strengthen several major responsibility systems in a planned and focused manner.

    In the entire process of implementing the operation plan and strengthening production scheduling, political work should be closely integrated with production, and the education of "the national plan is the law" and "completing the plan in a comprehensive and balanced manner" should be repeatedly and specifically carried out to the workers, overcoming conservative thinking, commending advanced figures, and organizing regular labor competitions to ensure the successful realization of the operation plan.

    The meeting was followed by a speech by Ma Tianshui, Director of the Department of Industry of the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau. He said: Shanghai's heavy industry factories only focused on the monthly plan in the first half of this year, and did not focus on grasping the plan by ten-day periods and daily, so the phenomenon of working overtime, rushing at the end, and being slack at the beginning is still very serious. Therefore, focusing on compiling and implementing operation plans as the current center of work is completely in line with the actual situation of Shanghai factories. Only in this way can the factories overcome the chaos in production management and further tap potential. According to the inspection of the operation plans of eight machinery factories, except for the Shanghai Motor Factory which has some foundation, the general situation is: lack of data, poor foundation, and many factors that disrupt the plan. However, the factories should never wait for the conditions to be available before compiling and implementing the operation plan. On the contrary, they should improve conditions and lay the foundation through the implementation of the operation plan. In the implementation of the operation plan, the Party committee must grasp the ideology and grasp the key. Because the implementation of the operation plan requires the efforts of all employees. In addition to the workers, special attention should be paid to strengthening the ideological education of technical and management personnel.

    Finally, Ma Tianshui, Director of the Department of Industry of the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau, asked the cadres of each factory to strengthen their study, work hard, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and oppose pride and complacency, so as to ensure the successful completion of the work in the second half of the year.

    中共上海市委重工业部
    布置编制和贯彻作业计划的工作
    八月十三日，中共上海市委重工业部召开上海市各国营、公私合营的重工业工厂的党员负责干部会议，布置各厂在下半年的工作中应以编制和贯彻作业计划为中心环节。
    会上，市委重工业部部长杨士法根据各厂的工作基础和生产情况的不同，分别提出了不同的要求，并着重指出：各厂在讨论国家计划以后，除结合制定奖励制度外，应以编制和贯彻作业计划为中心工作。其中特别要加强车间与工段的作业计划，具体规定小组、个人的按月、按周、按日的进度。各厂应在编制九月份作业计划时集中精力，发动群众，按规定程序认真编制，并加强检查和监督，使制度坚持下去。编制作业计划时，应由粗到细、由简到繁，先着手加强主要车间的作业计划，研究编制中的问题，分析打乱作业计划的因素，然后逐步推及其他车间。
    为保证作业计划的贯彻，各厂还需要建立与加强调度工作，经常监督检查作业计划的执行，并在既定的作业计划下主动发现与解决问题，特别是对各有关车间之间及职能科间的平衡工作应及时调度。同时，在贯彻作业计划中必须有步骤有重点地建立与加强几种主要的责任制度。
    在贯彻作业计划与加强生产调度工作的整个过程中，政治工作应紧密地结合生产，反复地具体地向职工进行“国家计划就是法律”与“全面均衡地完成计划”的教育，克服保守思想，表扬先进人物，组织经常性的劳动竞赛，以保证作业计划胜利实现。
    会议接着由中共中央华东局工业部部长马天水讲话。他说：上海市各重工业今年上半年只着重抓了月计划，没有着重按旬按日地抓计划，所以至今加班加点、前松后紧现象仍极严重。因此，以编制和贯彻作业计划为目前工作中心是完全符合上海各厂实际情况的。只有如此，各厂才能克服生产管理上的忙乱现象，才能进一步挖掘潜力。根据对八个机器厂的作业计划的检查情况看来，除上海电机厂有些基础外，一般情况是：资料缺，基础差，打乱计划的因素很多。但是，各厂决不应该等待条件具备后再编制和贯彻作业计划，相反地，应通过贯彻作业计划来改善条件，奠立基础。在贯彻作业计划中，党委要抓思想、抓关键。因为贯彻作业计划是需要全体职工努力的。除工人外，特别要注意加强对技术人员和管理人员的思想教育。
    最后，中共中央华东局工业部部长马天水要求各厂干部加强学习，刻苦钻研，展开批评与自我批评，反对骄傲自满，以保证下半年工作胜利完成。
