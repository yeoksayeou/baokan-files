My Opinions on Traditional Chinese Medicine Research
Zhu Yan

Traditional Chinese medicine has a long history of three to four thousand years in medicine. Our understanding of the pharmacological phenomena and therapeutic efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine has been gained from long-term practice (it has not been analyzed by animal experiments or physical chemistry methods beforehand). Therefore, although there are many unclear aspects of traditional Chinese medicine in terms of academic theory, it still has practical significance in treatment. For example, ephedra, which our ancestors used to treat asthma, and changshan, which was used to treat malaria three or four thousand years ago, still occupy a certain position in modern scientific medicine. Some traditional Chinese medicines, before scientific proof is obtained, their clinical application seems absurd. For example, in the seventh century, people used pig liver and sheep liver to treat night blindness, and used sheep thyroid (thyroid gland) to treat goiter (thyroid enlargement). Before the discovery and proof of vitamin and endocrine therapy, these empirical treatments were often covered in extremely bizarre colors, until modern times when they were scientifically proven. We can cite many similar examples. For example, Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" in the Ming Dynasty recorded that red koji can treat infantile tinea capitis (it is not yet known whether it has an antibiotic effect), and gold juice (fecal water) and Ren Zhong Huang (preparation of fecal water) are used to treat febrile diseases (possibly related to bacteriophages). Folk remedies also use artemisia argyi (compositae plant) and lobelia chinensis (platycodon grandiflorum plant) to treat snake bites, and take residual blood from the placenta to prevent measles, etc. These experiences need to be proven by modern science. Some of the above examples show that traditional Chinese medicine not only provides us with information in treatment and enriches the content of modern medicine, but also helps us in the research of medical theories. Therefore, we should affirm in our thinking that traditional Chinese medicine is worth studying and must be studied and developed. I think the following points should be paid attention to when studying traditional Chinese medicine:

First, the study of traditional Chinese medicine should pay attention to the medical experience of traditional Chinese medicine. In the past or now, many people have adopted extremely incorrect attitudes towards my country's medical heritage. They believe that traditional Chinese medicine is valuable, but traditional Chinese medicine is not valuable. They separated traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine completely. This understanding is wrong. Traditional Chinese medicine has its unique experience in using traditional Chinese medicine. If we completely leave the experience of traditional Chinese medicine to study traditional Chinese medicine, we will not be able to better explore the medical heritage of the motherland. For example, rhubarb, morning glory, kansui, mirabilite (sodium sulfate), etc. in laxatives, if we simply look at them based on current pharmaceutical knowledge, they are just laxatives that promote the elimination of stool. However, when traditional Chinese medicine uses this type of laxative, its purpose is not only to relieve constipation. We can also use laxatives to treat some congested diseases in the upper part of the human body, such as conjunctival congestion, pulmonary hemorrhage, hepatic portal vein congestion, and some hypertension, using its stimulating effect on the large intestine to reduce its symptoms. Even infections of the skin on the head and face, such as boils, can be cured with laxatives. Furthermore, the use of kansui, bile arisaema, and rolling phlegm pills with sappanwood to treat epilepsy, and the use of morning glory and euphorbia to treat liver cirrhosis are also worthy of further observation and research. Furthermore, traditional Chinese medicines such as ginger and cassia twig are considered by modern pharmacology to only have a stomachic effect, but traditional Chinese medicine believes that they have the effect of promoting blood circulation and sweating. Because these drugs with spicy ingredients can cause a local stimulating effect on the mucous membranes of the mouth and stomach when taken internally; it can cause a reflex action on the human body whose nervous system is not in an anesthetized state, so that blood circulation is smooth and even sweating. In this way, traditional Chinese medicine has gradually recognized and mastered the holistic response of the human body to certain drug stimulations in long-term clinical practice, and uses these responses to deal with related diseases. If we can pay attention to these experiences when studying traditional Chinese medicine, the application range of traditional Chinese medicine will be expanded, and the academic theory of drug treatment will be gradually improved.

Second, the study of traditional Chinese medicine should pay attention to the method of administering medicine in traditional Chinese medicine. In traditional Chinese medicine drug therapy, the therapeutic effects of many methods are not directly produced by the drug. We should pay attention to this when studying traditional Chinese medicine. If we simply start from studying the drug itself, sometimes we cannot get the expected effect. For example, traditional Chinese medicine uses Tongguan powder or ginger soup to rescue sudden collapses, and its effect is not caused by the effect after the drug is absorbed, but by the reflex action caused by the stimulation of the skin or mucous membrane. Tongguan powder contains gleditsia sinensis, the main component of gleditsia sinensis is soapstone, which has a strong stimulating effect on the mucous membrane. When blown into the nasal cavity, it can immediately cause sneezing and wake the patient up; the spicy ingredients of ginger are poured into the stomach, and it also has a stimulating effect on the mucous membranes of the mouth, esophagus and stomach, thus producing a reflex action to wake the patient up. If these drugs are made into injections and injected subcutaneously or intravenously, they may not necessarily produce a nerve-exciting effect. Therefore, the study of traditional Chinese medicine should pay attention to the principles of traditional Chinese medicine administration. However, it must be understood that the reflexive excitatory effect caused by these drugs that have a stimulating effect on the respiratory tract or digestive tract is limited. When the central nervous system function is in a state of extreme paralysis, this stimulating reflex first aid treatment is ineffective. Furthermore, traditional Chinese medicine often uses the external application of plaster to treat skin trauma, ulcers or abscesses. According to folk experience, after the plaster is applied to the wound, it is often left unattended for three to five days. On the surface, this treatment seems unscientific. But in fact, general traumas and ulcers can also be cured with this ancient therapy. Because this plaster, which is made by decocting and frying, is a sterilized ointment, it can seal the external trauma of the human body, fix it, and prevent it from being invaded by external germs. If we only start from analyzing the medicinal ingredients contained in these plasters and ignore factors other than the drug's effect, then we will not be able to understand some of the therapeutic effects of traditional Chinese medicine well.

Third, the study of traditional Chinese medicine should consider the comprehensive effect after combined use. Generally speaking, modern pharmacologists pay more attention to analytical research, the purpose of which is to find the interaction between a certain pure compound or a certain atomic group and biological tissue cells. This method should also be adopted when studying traditional Chinese medicine. That is, first extract its pure ingredients from a certain traditional Chinese medicine, and then conduct pharmacological research to understand its effect on the organism from the essence of the drug, which is very important. However, it must be known that the effect of traditional Chinese medicine in treatment is by no means entirely the manifestation of the pharmacological effect of a certain raw medicine or a certain simple compound in it, but often the sum of the reaction phenomena caused by the simultaneous action of many different components on the organism. Because each raw medicine often contains a variety of components, even if only one raw medicine is used, it also has the compound meaning of multiple chemical components in effect. Therefore, the study of traditional Chinese medicine should first focus on the overall efficacy of a certain raw medicine or a certain prescription, and then analyze and study the individual effects of its constituent components and the relationship between them, in order to further understand the importance of each constituent component in the overall efficacy. Here, we can cite some examples to illustrate: For example, when traditional Chinese medicine uses changshan to treat malaria, it is often used with pinellia ternata, because the active ingredient of changshan has an emetic effect, while pinellia ternata has a antiemetic effect. Due to the antagonistic pharmacological properties of the two, the clinical effect of treating malaria can be fully exerted. For example, traditional Chinese medicine often uses Foshou powder (angelica sinensis and chuanxiong) to treat dysmenorrhea in women. We know that the angelica sinensis ingredient has the effect of eliminating spasm in the uterine muscles, while the chuanxiong ingredient has an analgesic effect. The synergistic effect of the two can further improve the effect of treating dysmenorrhea. Therefore, when analyzing and studying traditional Chinese medicine, we should not only pay attention to its comprehensive effect, but also pay special attention to clinical application.

Fourth, when studying plant-based traditional Chinese medicine, we should pay attention to understanding the original plant. Most traditional Chinese medicines are plants. When studying, we must understand the morphology, varieties, and whether they are moldy of these medicinal plants, otherwise we will waste our time and energy. For example, some people study the insecticidal effect of the traditional Chinese medicine heshi, and often use carrot seeds (general pharmacies often use it as a substitute), so the effect is not good, because the former is a compositae plant, while the latter is an umbelliferae plant.

Fifth, the study of traditional Chinese medicine must be combined with clinical practice. The purpose of studying traditional Chinese medicine is for clinical application. Therefore, the study must be closely combined with clinical practice. In the past, the research work of traditional Chinese medicine mostly stayed at the experimental stage in the laboratory, and did not pay attention to clinical application. Therefore, although there have been many achievements in drug chemistry and pharmacology, the role in enriching and improving clinical practice has been small. Future research work must first obey clinical needs and be carried out purposefully, with emphasis and in a planned way. For example, at present, there is a lack of drugs such as ergot, ipecac, and santonin. We should study uterine contraction drugs such as motherwort and achyranthes bidentata, antitussive and expectorant drugs such as platycodon grandiflorum and fritillaria cirrhosa, and anthelmintic drugs such as betel nut and quisqualis indica; and apply them clinically. In this way, on the one hand, the problem of drug shortage is solved, and on the other hand, the therapeutic effect of certain traditional Chinese medicines is affirmed in practice, which improves people's understanding of traditional Chinese medicine and enables traditional Chinese medicine to play a greater role in the construction of health undertakings.

    我对于中药研究工作的几点意见
    朱颜
    中药在医学上已有三、四千年的悠久历史了。我们对于中药的药理现象和治疗效用的认识，是从长期的实践中获得的（它在事前并没有经过动物试验或物理化学等方法的分析）。因此，中药在学理上虽有许多未明之处，但在治疗上仍有现实的意义。例如，在三、四千年前我们的祖先用来治疗气喘的麻黄和治疗疟疾的常山，在近代科学医学中仍占有一定的地位。有些中药在没有得到科学的证明以前，其临床应用似乎是荒诞不经的。例如，在七世纪时，人们已用猪肝、羊肝来治疗夜盲，用羊靥
    （甲状腺）来治疗瘿气（甲状腺肿大）等。在没有发现和证明维生素和内分泌素疗法以前，这些经验治疗法往往蒙着极其怪诞的色彩，直到现代才得到科学的证明。我们还可以举出不少类似的例子。例如明代李时珍的“本草纲目”记载红麴可以治疗小儿秃疮（它是否有抗生素的作用，现在还不知道），用金汁（粪水）、人中黄（粪水的制剂）治疗热性病（可能和噬菌体有关系），民间还用大叶蒿（菊科植物）和半边莲（桔梗科植物）来治疗毒蛇咬伤，服用胎盘中的余血来预防麻疹，等等。这些经验都有待现代科学去证明。上述的某些例子说明，中药不但在治疗上给我们提供了资料，丰富了现代医学的内容，而且在医疗理论的研究上它对我们也是有帮助的。因此，我们应当在思想上肯定起来：中药是值得研究，而且必须加以研究和发展的。我认为，在研究中药时应该注意下列几点：
    第一，研究中药应重视中医的医疗经验。无论在过去或现在，有许多人对我国的医学遗产采取了极不正确的态度。他们认为，中药是有价值的，但中医没有价值。他们把中医和中药截然分开了。这种认识是不对的。中医在使用中药上，有其独到的经验。如果完全离开中医的经验来研究中药，就不能很好地发掘祖国医药的遗产。例如泻药中的大黄、牵牛、甘遂、朴硝（硫酸钠）等，若单纯地根据目前的药学知识来看，只是些促进排除大便的泻药。但是中医使用这一类泻药时，其目的不仅仅在于通便而已。我们对于人体上部某些充血的病症，如结膜充血、肺出血、肝门静脉郁血及一部分高血压症等，也可利用泻药来治疗，利用它对大肠刺激的诱导作用来减轻其症状。甚至头面部皮肤的感染，如热疖等病，有的亦可用泻药治愈。还有用甘遂、胆南星、蒙石滚痰丸等来治疗癫痫，用牵牛、大戟等来治疗肝硬变等病的，这也是值得进一步观察和研究的。又如生姜、桂枝等中药，现代药物学认为只有健胃作用，但是中医却认为它们有促进血液循环和发汗的作用。因为，这些具有辛辣成分的药物，内服时对口腔及胃部粘膜能发生一种局部的刺激作用；它对神经系统尚未处在麻醉状态的人体，能引起反射作用，而使血液循环畅盛，以至出汗。中医就这样在长期的临床中逐步认识和掌握了人体对某些药物刺激的整体性反应，并根据这些反应来处理有关的病症。我们在研究中药时，如果能注意这些经验，将使中药的应用范围扩大，并逐步提高药物治疗的学理。
    第二，研究中药应注意中医的给药法。在中医的药物疗法里，有许多方法的治疗效果并不是由药物直接产生的。在研究中药时，我们应当注意这一点。如果单纯地从研究药物本身着手，有时候得不到预期的效果。譬如，中医用通关散或生姜汤来救治卒倒，其效果并不是由药物被吸收后的作用所引起的，而是对皮肤或粘膜的刺激作用所引起的反射作用。通关散中有皂角，皂角的主要成分系石碱草素，它对粘膜有强烈的刺激作用，当吹入鼻腔时，可以立刻引起喷嚏，使患者苏醒；生姜的辛辣成分灌入胃中时，对口腔、食道和胃的粘膜也有刺激作用，因而产生反射作用，使患者苏醒。如果用这些药物制成注射剂，注射于皮下或静脉时，就不一定会产生兴奋神经的效果。所以，研究中药时应注意中医给药法的道理。但必须了解，这些对呼吸道或消化道有刺激作用的药物所引起的反射性的兴奋作用，是有一定限度的，当中枢神经机能陷于极度麻痹状态时，这种刺激反射的急救处置是没有效果的。又如，中医对皮肤创伤、溃疡或脓肿，常用贴膏药的外敷法来医治。民间经验，用膏药把创面封贴以后，往往三五天不去管它。从表面上看，这种疗法似乎是不科学的。但实际上一般创伤、溃疡，也能用这种古老疗法治愈。因为，这种经过煎熬制成的膏药就是灭菌的油膏，它能把人体外部的创伤封闭起来，固定起来，使它不受外来病菌的侵袭。如果单从分析这些膏药所含的药物成分着手，忽视药物作用以外的因素，那末，我们就不能很好地认识中药的某些治疗效果。
    第三，研究中药应考虑合并使用后的综合效果。一般地说，现代从事药理学工作者都比较重视分析研究，其目的在于找寻某种纯粹化合物及其某一原子基团和生物组织细胞间的相互影响关系。在研究中药时，也应采取这种方法。即先从某种中药中提出其纯粹成分，然后进行药理研究，从药物本质上去认识其对生物体所起的作用，这是非常重要的。但是，必须知道，中药在治疗上所起的效应决不完全是某一样生药或其中某一种单纯化合物所具有的药理作用的表现，而常常是许多种不同成分同时作用于生物体所引起的反应现象的总和。因每一种生药往往含有多种成分，所以即使只应用一样生药，在效果上也具有多种化学成分的复方意义。因此，研究中药时首先应重视某一种生药或某一处方的总的效用，然后再分析研究其组成成分的个别作用及其相互间的关系，以便进一步了解各个组成成分在总效用中的重要性。这里，我们可以举一些例子来加以说明：比如中药在使用常山治疗疟疾时，往往和半夏同用，其原因是常山的有效成分具有催吐的作用，而半夏则具有镇吐的功效。由于两者的拮抗的药理性能，使治疟的临床效果得以充分发挥。又如中医治疗妇女的痛经，常用佛手散（当归和川芎）。我们知道，当归成分对子宫肌有消除痉挛的作用，而川芎成分则有镇痛的功效，两者的协同作用，使治疗痛经的效果更加提高。因此，我们在分析研究中药时，不仅要注意其综合的效果，还必须特别照顾到临床应用。
    第四，研究植物性中药，应当注意了解原植物。大部分中药都是植物，研究时必须了解这些药用植物的形态、品种及是否霉烂等情况，否则会使我们枉费时间和精力。例如，有人研究中药鹤虱的驱虫效用时，多用胡萝卜子（一般药店往往用它来作代用品），因此，效果不好，因为前者是菊科植物，而后者却是伞形科植物。
    第五，研究中药必须结合临床实用。研究中药的目的是为了临床应用，因此在研究时必须和临床实用密切结合起来。过去中药研究工作多停留在实验室的试验阶段，不注意临床应用，所以在药物化学、药理学上虽有不少的成就，但在临床实用的充实和改进方面，作用就显得不大了。今后的研究工作必须首先服从临床需要，有目的、有重点、有计划地来进行。譬如，目前缺乏麦角、吐根、山道年等药物，我们就应当研究子宫收缩药如益母草、牛膝，镇咳祛痰药如桔梗、贝母，驱虫药如槟榔、使君子；并在临床上把它们应用起来。这样，一方面解决了药物缺乏的问题，另一方面在实践中肯定了某些中药的治疗效果，提高了人们对中药的认识，使中药在卫生事业建设中起更大的作用。
