The work of erecting military demarcation line markers was carried out according to the agreement of the staff officers' meeting of the Military Armistice Commission. Each joint observer team's section was divided into two parts, and both sides sent a marker team composed of seventy-five unarmed personnel, under the supervision of their respective members of the joint observer teams. The marker teams of the Korean-Chinese side started work in various sections successively from August 8th and 9th, and were all completed before the 17th.

The staff of the Korean-Chinese side's marker teams carried out this work with a very serious and conscientious attitude.

    我方完成树立军事分界线标志物工作
    【新华社开城十九日电】朝中方面树立军事分界线标志物的工作已经全部完成。
    树立军事分界线标志物的工作是根据军事停战委员会参谋人员会议的协议，把各联合观察小组负责的地段分为两段，双方分别派出由七十五名非武装人员组成的标志队，在各联合观察小组本方组员的监督下进行的。朝中方面各地段的标志队从八月八日和九日先后开始工作，到十七日前已先后全部完成。
    朝中方面各标志队的工作人员以十分严肃和认真的态度来进行这一工作。他们根据地图所标示的“军事分界线”，精密地测定实际的军事分界线的正确位置，然后选择适当地点树立标志物。他们越过悬崖绝壁丛林荆棘，扫除战场的各种危险物，克服各种困难，努力完成了树立军事分界线标志物的任务。
    检查军事分界线标志物的工作，待联合观察小组双方组员就互相检查的细节作出具体安排以后即可开始。
