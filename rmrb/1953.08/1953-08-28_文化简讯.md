Cultural and Art Workers in Northeast China and Shenyang Create Many Literary and Artistic Works to Cooperate with the General Election Publicity

Cultural and art workers in Northeast China and Shenyang City have created many literary and artistic works related to the general election to cooperate with the general election publicity.

In mid-May, the Northeast Cultural Bureau convened a meeting of heads of various literary and artistic units in Northeast China and Shenyang City. They discussed the issues related to general election creation and formulated specific creation plans.

After studying the election law and related documents, the literary and artistic workers who participated in the general election creation in various places went deep into the pilot areas of typical general elections to experience life and carry out creation. At present, the creation plan has been basically completed. The Northeast People's Art Theater has created a one-act drama "In the Days of the General Election" and a drum lyric "Who to Elect as a Representative." The Northeast People's Publishing House has published four works, including "A Voter's Certificate," using folk art forms such as Shandong Kuaishu, drum lyrics, and lotus drop. The Northeast Conservatory of Music created five songs, including "Election Serenade" and "A Voter's Certificate, A Heart." The Northeast Academy of Fine Arts painted two propaganda posters, including "Go to Participate in the Election." In addition, literary and art workers in Shenyang City have also created a batch of songs, small performances, and comic strips. Some of these songs and performances have been broadcast on radio stations, and some comic strips are being made into slides. Now, these works have been widely used in various places to cooperate with the general election publicity, and the effect is good. A letter from the people received by the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Culture stated that the comic strip of the election law is of great help to them in learning about the general election.

Tibetan People on the Tibetan Plateau Perform Plays to Celebrate the Harvest Season

The rainy season on the Tibetan Plateau has passed, and crops are about to ripen. In these clear days, Tibetan people in various places are unfolding drama activities to celebrate the most pleasant season of the year.

Since August 10th (the first day of the seventh month of the Tibetan calendar), twelve folk troupes from various places have come to Lhasa to perform plays. The largest Tibetan troupe, "Gyumulong," with a history of nearly two hundred years and more than seventy actors, also came from the Shannan area to perform. From August 10th to 14th, various troupes performed jointly for four consecutive days in Norbulingka, a western suburb of Lhasa. The shady avenues of the always quiet Norbulingka were crowded with people watching the plays all day long. During the performance, General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, and responsible cadres of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also went to watch the plays at the invitation of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama also hosted a banquet.

After the joint performance, each troupe performed separately in Lhasa for ten days, and after the performance, they will be dispersed to various areas for touring performances. The content of Tibetan drama is very exciting, mostly depicting the diligence and bravery of the Tibetan people and stories about religious myths. The story of Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty and Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo's marriage is the most famous historical drama in Tibet. This play vividly narrates the situation of Princess Wencheng introducing Han culture to Tibet, shows the historical relationship between the two major ethnic groups of Han and Tibet, and is a famous play that the Tibetan people love very much. The actors in the Tibetan troupes have a certain degree of artistic accomplishment. Their singing is loud and bold, and their dance movements are also excellent.

Wu Yonggang, the director of the Shanghai Film Studio responsible for making this film, and Wang Li, the assistant director, arrived in Dihua at the end of July. They are now actively working.
