    The characteristic of the current world situation, as pointed out in Comrade Malenkov's extremely important speech on August 8th, is that on the one hand, the relaxation of international tensions has begun, and on the other hand, the die-hard aggressors are trying their best to oppose this relaxation and are trying to make the situation even more tense. This sinister policy of the aggressors is sharply manifested in the US attitude towards the Korean issue.

    Apart from the aggressors, the whole world feels great relief because of the Korean armistice. The vast majority of people around the world expect the armistice to bring peace to Korea and the entire Far East, and to put the tense world on the path of resolving disputes through consultation. There is no reason to believe that the majority of people are wrong. However, when Dulles set off for South Korea, public opinion in many countries showed serious unease. They rightly pointed out that the US government was pre-emptively creating the failure of the political conference and undermining the possibility of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    The so-called "Common Security Treaty" signed by Dulles and Syngman Rhee a week after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, as well as the joint statement they issued, confirmed the concerns of public opinion in various countries. This so-called "Common Security Treaty" is essentially a military alliance between the United States and Syngman Rhee, and is a plan for the United States to continue to encourage Syngman Rhee to undermine peace in Korea. At the same time, Dulles also coerced the other fifteen countries that sent troops to Korea with the United States to issue a joint "declaration" threatening "the resumption of armed struggle" to intimidate the Korean and Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world.

    Dulles' approach is tantamount to burying a bomb on the road to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, attempting to blow up the political conference and prevent a genuine peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. All governments and people who support the Korean armistice and agree to resolve the Korean issue through peaceful consultation cannot but resolutely oppose this major conspiracy of Dulles and Syngman Rhee and arouse the highest degree of vigilance.

    It is well known that the Syngman Rhee clique has been constantly clamoring against the armistice before and after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, declaring that it will "advance north" and "unify Korea by force," and this clamor has been openly supported by Dulles. Therefore, Dulles and Syngman Rhee's claim to guard against the Korean and Chinese side's "unprovoked armed attack on South Korea" cannot attract any serious attention. The purpose of Dulles and Syngman Rhee's negotiations is actually to enable the United States to station troops in South Korea indefinitely, and to make the United States, like Syngman Rhee, not bound by the armistice agreement when launching new offensives.

    The indefinite stationing of US troops in South Korea is a direct violation of the armistice agreement. Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement clearly stipulates: "In order to ensure a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the military commanders of both sides hereby suggest to the governments of the countries concerned on both sides to convene a higher-level political conference of both sides within three months after the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement, and to discuss issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue." According to Dulles' plan, Syngman Rhee, with the aid of the US military, will inevitably undermine the armistice, and there is a danger that the Korean War will break out again.

    Dulles and Syngman Rhee have prepared all the excuses for undermining the political conference and undermining the armistice. The joint statement of Dulles and Syngman Rhee shows that the United States will support the reactionary dictator Syngman Rhee's plan for "unifying Korea" at the political conference, which will put the political conference in a predetermined deadlock. Then, after ninety days, the United States and Syngman Rhee will withdraw from the political conference according to the predetermined plan and will no longer be bound by the armistice agreement. That is to say, Syngman Rhee will implement "unification of Korea by force," and the US military will provide assistance according to the so-called "Common Security Treaty."

    It can be seen that Dulles and Syngman Rhee have nakedly put forward preconditions and stipulated time limits for the future political conference. According to the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the higher-level political conference should be convened jointly by representatives of the governments of the countries concerned on both sides of the Korean War. However, before the political conference was convened, Dulles and Syngman Rhee made such arbitrary decisions behind the backs of Korea and China and other countries related to the Korean issue, including the other allies of the United States, and attempted to impose them on the political conference. This is not only a complete violation of the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, not only a provocation to the Korean and Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world, but also an open coercion to other countries participating in the political conference.

    Dulles, a master of inverting right and wrong, in his conversation with the ambassadors to Washington of the fifteen countries that invaded Korea, actually described the United States' vicious aggressive plan as "the sacrifices made by the United States for the benefit of the armistice" and as the result of the running dog oppressing its master. What a pitiful imperialist! But everyone knows that Dulles's purpose in plotting to undermine the political conference is nothing more than to continue to create tension in Korea in order to continue to expand the maximum profits of Wall Street arms dealers. In any case, Dulles and his ilk think too easily. Resuming the war is by no means only a sweet thing for the US rulers. The experience of the Korean War and the negotiations has shown that since the United States cannot solve the problem by military means, it must honestly sit down and negotiate with a spirit of equal treatment. The number of people who believe this truth has increased many times since the armistice was realized than during the war. The governments and people who have suffered losses due to the Korean War and have gained benefits and hopes due to the Korean armistice will never support the very few crazy professional murderers. The task now facing all peace-loving people is to act quickly to stop Dulles and Syngman Rhee's new diabolical plan, so that it cannot be realized in the light of day, and so that it cannot hinder the easing of the international situation.

### 击破和平敌人破坏政治会议的阴谋

    击破和平敌人破坏政治会议的阴谋
    目前世界形势的特点，正如马林科夫同志八月八日的极重要的演说所指出的，是一方面开始了国际紧张局势的缓和，另一方面死硬的侵略分子却竭力反对这种缓和，并且竭力要使局势更加紧张。侵略分子的这种罪恶政策尖锐地表现在美国对朝鲜问题的态度上。
    除了侵略分子以外，全世界都因为朝鲜停战而感觉莫大的安慰。全世界极大多数人都指望停战将给朝鲜和整个远东带来和平，将使得紧张的世界走上用协商解决争端的道路。没有理由认为大多数人想得不对。但是当杜勒斯起程到南朝鲜去的时候，很多国家的舆论界就表现了严重的不安。他们公正地指出美国政府正在预先制造政治会议的失败，正在破坏朝鲜问题和平解决的可能性。
    在朝鲜停战协定签字一个星期以后由杜勒斯和李承晚签订的所谓“共同安全条约”，以及他们所发表的联合声明，证实了各国舆论的忧虑。这个所谓“共同安全条约”，实质上是美国和李承晚订立的一个军事同盟，是美国继续鼓励李承晚破坏朝鲜和平的计划。与此同时，杜勒斯还胁迫和美国一道出兵朝鲜的其他十五个国家发出了一个共同“宣言”，以“武装斗争复起”相威胁，对朝中人民和全世界和平人民进行恐吓。
    杜勒斯的这种作法，无异于是在和平解决朝鲜问题的道路上，埋下了一颗炸弹，企图炸毁政治会议，使朝鲜问题得不到真正的和平解决。一切支持朝鲜停战，赞成用和平协商办法解决朝鲜问题的各国政府和人民，不能不坚决反对杜勒斯和李承晚的这个重大阴谋而引起最高度的警惕。
    李承晚集团在朝鲜停战协定签字前后，不断叫嚣反对停战，宣称要“向北推进”，“武力统一朝鲜”，而这种叫嚣又得到杜勒斯的公开支持，这是谁都知道的。因此，杜勒斯和李承晚说什么要提防朝中方面“向韩国发动无端的武装进攻”，是不能引起任何郑重的注意的。杜勒斯和李承晚谈判的目的，实际上就是要使美国无限期驻兵南朝鲜，并使美国和李承晚一样在发动新的进攻时不受停战协定的约束。
    美国无限期驻兵南朝鲜是直接违反停战协定的。朝鲜停战协定第六十款曾明确规定：“为保证朝鲜问题的和平解决，双方军事司令官兹向双方有关各国政府建议在停战协定签字并生效后的三个月内，分派代表召开双方高一级的政治会议，协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题。”照杜勒斯的这个计划，李承晚在美国军队援助之下必将破坏停战，朝鲜战争就有重新爆发的危险。
    杜勒斯和李承晚已经为破坏政治会议和破坏停战准备了一切口实。杜勒斯和李承晚的联合声明表明美国将在政治会议上支持反动独裁者李承晚的“统一朝鲜”的计划，这将使政治会议陷于预定的僵局，然后，在九十天以后，美国和李承晚将按照预定的计划退出政治会议，不再受停战协定的约束。这就是说，李承晚将实行“武力统一朝鲜”，而美国军队将根据所谓“共同安全条约”而加以援助。
    由此可见，杜勒斯和李承晚已赤裸裸地对未来的政治会议提出了先决条件，并规定了时限。按照朝鲜停战协定的规定，高一级的政治会议应由朝鲜战争交战双方有关各国政府分派代表共同召开。但是在政治会议还未召开之前，杜勒斯和李承晚就背着朝中两国以及其他与朝鲜问题有关的国家，包括美国的其他盟国在内，作出了这样横蛮的决定，而企图强加在政治会议之上。这不但完全违反了朝鲜停战协定的规定，不但是对朝中人民和全世界爱好和平人民的挑衅，而且是对于参加政治会议的其他国家的公开的胁迫。
    颠倒是非的能手杜勒斯，在和十五个侵朝国家驻华盛顿大使谈话时，把美国的凶恶的侵略计划居然说成是“美国为了停战的利益而作的牺牲”，说成是走狗压迫了主人的结果。真是很可怜的帝国主义者！但是大家都知道，杜勒斯预谋破坏政治会议的目的，无非是继续在朝鲜制造紧张局势，以便继续扩大华尔街军火商人的最大限度的利润。无论如何，杜勒斯之流未免想得太容易了。恢复战争甚至对于美国统治者也决不是只有甜蜜的一面。朝鲜战争和谈判的经验已经显示出，美国用军事办法既然解决不了问题，就必须老老实实地坐下来，以平等对待的精神来协商。信服这个真理的人，由于停战的实现，已经比战争进行期间增加多少倍了。由于朝鲜战争而受到损失，由于朝鲜停战而得到利益和希望的政府和人民，决不会支持极少数疯狂的职业杀人犯。现在摆在一切愿意和平的人们面前的任务，就是迅速行动起来制止杜勒斯和李承晚的新的恶魔式的计划，使它不能在日光之下实现，使它不能阻挠国际形势的缓和。
