Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 14th: At the August 14th meeting of the POW Repatriation Committee, the Korean-Chinese side strongly protested that the United Nations Command side continued to adopt various barbaric methods in the process of repatriating prisoners of war, killing and abusing captured Korean and Chinese personnel, and forcibly detaining some captured Korean and Chinese personnel who were about to be repatriated. The Korean-Chinese side demanded that the United Nations Command side immediately stop all atrocities against prisoners of war, punish all murderers who persecuted prisoners of war, and promptly repatriate all captured Korean and Chinese personnel forcibly detained by the United Nations Command side. The Korean-Chinese side solemnly pointed out to the United Nations Command side: if the United Nations Command side continues such criminal acts against captured Korean and Chinese personnel, the United Nations Command side will be fully responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom. At the same meeting, the Korean-Chinese side also strongly protested that the United Nations Command side violated the provisions of the Armistice Agreement and the Joint Red Cross Team Work Agreement by unreasonably restricting and obstructing the work of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives in visiting and comforting captured Korean and Chinese personnel. The Korean-Chinese side demanded that the United Nations Command side immediately stop such unreasonable behavior and provide full cooperation and convenience to the Korean-Chinese Red Cross personnel. The Korean-Chinese side hoped that the United Nations Command side could provide a clear reply to this issue within three days.

The full text of the Korean-Chinese side's statement strongly protesting the United Nations Command side's continued persecution of POWs after the ceasefire is as follows:

Your side's criminal acts of massacring and persecuting our captured personnel during the war have been cursed and condemned by people all over the world. Our side has also repeatedly lodged serious protests with your side. After the ceasefire, your persecution of our captured personnel has not only not stopped, but has intensified and become more serious. In the process of repatriating prisoners of war, your side has adopted various barbaric means to kill and abuse our captured personnel.

On July 27, 1953, our captured personnel housed in your 64th Hospital on Geoje Island cheered and sang to celebrate the signing of the Armistice Agreement. This was perfectly legitimate. However, your armed forces entered the hospital, threw poison gas bombs at our captured personnel, and stabbed and beat them with bayonets and rifle butts. After many of our captured personnel were beaten and injured, your hospital refused to treat them. On the same day, your armed forces again entered the hospital and strafed our sick and wounded captured personnel with machine guns and carbines, killing two on the spot, seriously injuring two, and slightly injuring two.

On August 3, 1953, a batch of our sick and wounded captured personnel departed from your 64th Hospital. Your side installed five types of poison gas bombs on the vehicles they were traveling in, and detonated three of them during transportation, causing most of our captured personnel to faint or be injured. When this group of people arrived at the wharf to board the ship, your side deliberately attempted to harm them by filling the cabin with poison gas and forcing them to enter, resulting in the poisoning of all our captured personnel.

On the morning of August 7, 1953, your side attacked our captured personnel in the Busan No. 2 POW camp with poison gas bombs for as long as an hour and a half, causing all our captured personnel to be poisoned and faint, with many seriously injured.

When your side transported our captured personnel from the Chinese People's Volunteers, you used the barbaric means of poisoning their food to harm them, resulting in 178 people becoming poisoned and falling ill, experiencing dizziness, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.

When your side transported our female captured personnel, your armed personnel wearing gas masks threw six poison gas bombs into the carriages they were traveling in, and used six gas sprayers to spray our female captured personnel and children, causing them all to faint. Among them, eight were burned, and two were unconscious.

On the morning of August 10, 1953, when our captured personnel departed from Geoje Island, your armed personnel stabbed Kim Deok-gyeom in the face and waist with a bayonet. On the same day, near Munsan, your armed personnel stabbed Choi Tae-gyu and Zhu Lihao with bayonets. On August 11, in Yeongdeungpo, your armed personnel prohibited our captured personnel from carrying letters of comfort issued by our Red Cross representatives, and stabbed one of our captured personnel in the abdomen with a bayonet. On the afternoon of August 12, near Busan, your armed personnel entered the carriages where our captured personnel were traveling and stabbed Lee Jun-seop, Seo Hong-soon, and Kim ?-soo with bayonets.

Your side doubled the abuse of our captured personnel during transportation, not giving them food or water. The vehicles and ships were extremely crowded, the air was polluted, and the stench was overwhelming, seriously damaging the health of our captured personnel. Such facts are too numerous to mention.

Our side would also like to solemnly point out that your side is still forcibly detaining our captured personnel when they are about to be repatriated. For example, on July 27, 1953, your side forcibly seized 150 of our captured personnel from your 64th Hospital on Geoje Island. On the same afternoon, your side entered the 8th POW camp on Jeju Island with four infantry companies and eleven tanks, unreasonably detaining 102 of our captured personnel. Later, you forcibly sent two healthy captured personnel from the camp to the hospital and refused to release them. The three children of our female captured personnel, Li Fuzhu, were all dragged away by your side. When she requested that you release her children before repatriation, your side not only did not release the children, but detained Li Fuzhu and stated, "You will get your children if you don't return to North Korea."

Your side's barbaric and brutal behavior towards our captured personnel is absolutely intolerable to our side, and is also intolerable to the people all over the world. Now, our side once again lodges a serious protest with your side. Our side demands that your side immediately stop all atrocities against prisoners of war and punish all murderers who persecuted prisoners of war. Our side demands that your side promptly repatriate all our captured personnel forcibly detained by your side. If your side continues such criminal acts against our captured personnel, your side will be fully responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom.

The full text of the Korean-Chinese side's statement strongly protesting the United Nations Command side's unreasonable restrictions and obstruction of the work of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross personnel is as follows:

According to reports from our representatives on the Joint Red Cross Team, your military authorities have been using various pretexts to unreasonably obstruct the work of our representatives in the South Group of the Joint Red Cross Team in visiting your POW camps and comforting the POWs, making it impossible for them to provide humanitarian services to the POWs. For example, your military authorities restricted our representatives in the Busan Group from talking to POW representatives, forcibly ordered the latter to leave the talking venue, unreasonably inspected our representatives' words of comfort to the POWs, and used threats to the safety of our representatives to obstruct our representatives' visits. By 23:00 on August 8, 1953, they had been forced to stop working. Most of the gifts had not yet been distributed to the POWs.

Our representatives in the Imjin River Bridge Group were only allowed to talk to the POWs outside the barbed wire fence of the camp. Your military authorities later unreasonably restricted the visiting hours to after 18:00, and obstructed our representatives' visits on the pretext that the POWs singing and saluting our representatives were "political actions." When our representatives refused your military authorities' unreasonable inspection of our representatives' words of comfort to the POWs, your POW management authorities even canceled our representatives' visits. This made it impossible for our representatives to carry out their visiting work at all.

For our representatives in the Geoje Island Group, your military authorities restricted the distribution of gifts, did not allow our representatives to give cigarettes to the POWs, did not allow them to send letters of comfort to the POWs, prohibited POW gatherings, and did not give the group's representatives communication facilities with other groups. What is especially intolerable is that your POW management authorities actually made our representatives live in camps surrounded by two barbed wire fences.

For our representatives in the Yeongdeungpo Group, your military authorities prohibited them from inspecting the train equipment carrying the POWs. Due to the censorship of your military authorities, they were unable to deliver words of comfort to the POWs on August 6, 7, and 8, 1953. What best demonstrates your brutality towards the POWs and your contempt for our Red Cross representatives is that your side actually distributed gas masks to our Red Cross representatives. May I ask, if Red Cross representatives must be ready to wear gas masks at any time, how can they carry out their work?

What is especially shocking is that your side actually used poison gas on the POWs. The poison gas invaded the residence of the Red Cross Team. At 6:45 a.m. on August 9, 1953, an incident of releasing tear gas occurred in the POW camp area on Geoje Island. The tear gas came from the eastern POW camp area with the wind, invading our representatives' huts. The gas caused the entire team to suffer from tearing, coughing, and difficulty breathing for about an hour.

From the above examples, it can be seen how unreasonably your military authorities restricted and obstructed the work of our representatives in visiting and comforting the POWs. In fact, your side has made their humanitarian service to the POWs extremely difficult. This violates the provisions of Article 57, Item 1 of the Armistice Agreement and the Joint Red Cross Team Work Agreement, which was fully agreed upon and approved by both sides of this Committee. Your unreasonable restrictions and obstruction of our Red Cross personnel, who are dedicated to humanitarian service, will not only surprise the people of the world, but will also render the relevant clauses of the Armistice Agreement and the Joint Red Cross Team Work Agreement meaningless. Therefore, our side lodges a serious protest with your side. Your side should immediately stop all of the aforementioned unreasonable behaviors and provide full cooperation and convenience to our representatives on the Joint Red Cross Team. I hope that your side can provide our side with a clear reply within three days.

    在战俘遣返委员会八月十四日会上
    我方严重抗议美方继续迫害战俘
    并抗议对我红十字会代表的工作横加阻挠
    【新华社开城十四日电】在八月十四日的战俘遣返委员会上，朝中方面严重抗议联合国军方面在遣返战俘过程中，仍继续采取种种野蛮手段，杀害、虐待朝中被俘人员，并在若干朝中被俘人员即将被遣返时，仍然对他们实行强迫扣留。朝中方面要求联合国军方面立即制止一切迫害战俘的暴行，惩办一切迫害战俘的凶手，迅速遣返为联合国军所强迫扣留的全部朝中被俘人员。朝中方面向联合国军方面郑重指出：如果联合国军方面对朝中被俘人员仍继续这种罪恶行为，其所引起的一切后果，完全由联合国军方面负责。同日会上，朝中方面并严重抗议联合国军方面违反停战协定与联合红十字会小组工作协议的规定，而对朝中红十字会代表访问与慰问朝中被俘人员的工作横加限制与阻挠。朝中方面要求联合国军方面立即停止这种无理行为，给予朝中红十字会人员充分的合作与便利。朝中方面希望联合国军方面能在三天内就此问题提出明确的答复。
    朝中方面严重抗议联合国军方面在停战后继续迫害战俘的声明全文如下：
    你方在战争期间屠杀和迫害我方被俘人员的罪恶行为，已遭受到全世界人民的咀咒和谴责。我方亦曾一再向你方提出严重抗议。停战以后你方对我方被俘人员的迫害非但未予停止，反而变本加厉，益趋严重。在遣返战俘的过程中，你方采取了种种野蛮手段来杀害和虐待我方被俘人员。
    一九五三年七月二十七日，收容于巨济岛你方六十四号病院中的我方被俘人员，为庆祝停战协定的签字而欢呼歌唱。这是完全正当的。但是你方武装部队却开入该病院，向我方被俘人员投掷毒气弹，并以刺刀、枪托进行刺杀和殴打。我方被俘人员多名被打受伤后，你方医院又拒绝治疗。当日你方武装部队又进入该病院用机枪、卡宾枪向我方病伤被俘人员扫射，当场死亡二名，重伤二名，轻伤二名。
    一九五三年八月三日，我方病伤被俘人员一批自你方六十四号病院出发。你方在他们所乘汽车上安装五种毒气弹，运送途中放了三枚，使我方被俘人员大部晕倒或受伤。该批人员至码头上船时，你方又蓄意对他们进行谋害。将舱内放满毒气，强迫他们进入舱内，以致我方被俘人员全部中毒。
    一九五三年八月七日上午，你方在釜山第二战俘营以毒气弹向我方被俘人员攻击达一小时半之久，致使我方被俘人员全部中毒晕倒，其中并有多人受重伤。
    你方在运送我方中国人民志愿军被俘人员时，曾以在饭中放毒的野蛮手段来谋害他们。致有一百七十八人中毒病倒，头晕腹痛，上吐下泻。
    在你方运送我方女被俘人员时，戴有防毒具之你方武装人员，曾向她们所乘的车厢内投掷毒气弹六枚，并用瓦斯喷射器六具向我方女被俘人员及小孩喷射。致使她们全部晕倒。其中并有八名被烧伤，二名昏迷不省人事。
    一九五三年八月十日早晨，我方被俘人员自巨济岛出发时，你方武装人员以刺刀刺伤我方被俘人员金德兼的面部及腰部。同日在汶山附近你方武装人员以刺刀将我方被俘人员崔太奎、朱礼浩二人刺伤。八月十一日，在永登浦你方武装人员禁止我方被俘人员携带我方红十字会代表发给他们的慰问信，并以刺刀将我方被俘人员一人腹部刺伤。八月十二日下午，在釜山附近你方武装人员进入我方被俘人员所乘车厢，以刺刀刺伤我方被俘人员李俊燮、徐洪顺、金?秀三人。
    你方对我方被俘人员在运送途中加倍虐待，不给饭吃，不给水喝。车船上拥挤不堪，空气污浊，臭气熏天，严重损害我方被俘人员的健康。这类事实更不胜枚举。
    我方还要郑重指出：你方在我方被俘人员即将被遣返时，仍然对我方被俘人员实行强迫扣留。例如：一九五三年七月二十七日你方从巨济岛六十四号病院中强行抓走一百五十名我方被俘人员。同日下午你方以四个步兵连十一辆坦克，开入济州岛第八战俘营，无理扣押我方被俘人员一百零二人之后，又从该营将两名健康的我方被俘人员强迫送入病院，不肯放出。我方女被俘人员李福竹三个小孩均被你方拖走，临遣返时要求你方将其小孩放出。你方非但不放小孩，反将李福竹予以扣留，并声称：“你不回北朝鲜就给你孩子”。
    你方对我方被俘人员这种野蛮残暴的行为，是我方绝对不能容忍的，也是全世界人民所不能容忍的。现在，我方再一次向你方提出严重抗议。我方要求你方立即制止一切迫害战俘的暴行，惩办一切迫害战俘的凶手。我方要求你方迅速将被你方强迫扣留的我方被俘人员全部遣返。如果你方对我方被俘人员仍然继续这种罪恶的行为，其所引起的一切后果完全由你方负责。
    朝中方面严重抗议联合国军方面对朝中红十字会人员的工作横加限制与阻挠的声明全文如下：
    根据联合红十字会小组我方代表报告，你方军事当局对于联合红十字会小组南组各分组的我方代表访问你方战俘营并对战俘进行慰问的工作，以种种藉口横加阻挠，致使他们无法对战俘进行人道主义的服务。例如：对釜山分组我方代表，你方军事当局限制我方代表与战俘代表谈话，强令后者离开谈话场所，无理地检查我方代表对战俘的慰问词，并以威胁我方代表安全为手段，阻挠我方代表的访问。到一九五三年八月八日二十三时，他们已被迫停止工作。大部馈赠品尚未分发给战俘。
    临津江桥分组我方代表只被允许在营房的铁丝网之外与战俘谈话。你方军事当局后又毫无理由地限制访问时间在十八时之后，并藉口战俘唱歌和向我方代表敬礼是“政治性行动”，阻挠我方代表的访问。当我方代表拒绝你方军事当局无理检查我方代表对战俘的慰问词时，你方战俘管理当局竟取消了我方代表的访问。这样就使我方代表的访问工作根本无法进行。
    对巨济岛分组我方代表，你方军事当局限制馈赠品的分发，不准我方代表向战俘发香烟，不准向战俘发慰问信，禁止召开战俘集会，不给该分组我方代表与其他各分组的通讯便利。尤其不能容忍的是你方战俘管理当局竟叫我方代表住在有两道铁丝网围绕着的营房内。
    对永登浦分组我方代表，你方军事当局禁止他们视察载运战俘的火车设备。由于你方军事当局的审查，他们在一九五三年八月六、七、八三天，不能对战俘致慰问词。最足以表现出你方对战俘的残暴和对我方红十字会代表的蔑视的，是你方竟将防毒面具分发给我方红十字会代表。请问如果红十字会代表必须随时准备带上防毒面具，他们如何能进行工作？
    尤其令人惊骇者，你方竟对战俘施放了毒气。毒气侵袭至红十字会小组的驻地。一九五三年八月九日上午六时四十五分，在巨济岛俘虏营地区发生了施放催泪性毒气的事件。催泪性毒气随风自东面俘虏营场而来，侵袭了我方代表的小屋，毒气使全组经受流泪、咳嗽及呼吸困难之苦约达一小时。
    从上述一些例子中，可见你方军事当局对于我方代表向战俘进行访问和慰问的工作，是如何地横加限制和阻挠。事实上，你方已使他们对战俘人道主义的服务陷于非常困难的境地，这是和停战协定第五十七款寅项的规定与本委员会双方完全同意并批准的联合红十字会小组工作协议相违反的。你方这些对于以人道主义服务为目的的我方红十字会人员的无理限制与阻挠，除了使世界人民惊讶以外，将使停战协定的有关条款和联合红十字会小组工作协议失去意义。为此我方向你方提出严重抗议。你方应立即停止所有上述的无理行为，并应对联合红十字会小组我方代表给予充分的合作与便利。我希望你方能在三日内给予我方以明确的答复。
