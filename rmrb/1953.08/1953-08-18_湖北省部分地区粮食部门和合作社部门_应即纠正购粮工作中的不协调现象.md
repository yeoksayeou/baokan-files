In the grain purchase work in Huangpi, Xiaogan, Tianmen, Yunmeng, Echeng and other areas of Hubei Province, the uncoordinated relationship between the state-owned grain departments and the cooperative departments has resulted in losses in the grain purchase work and aroused dissatisfaction among farmers.

During the wheat harvest season, the grain bureaus of Huangpi, Xiaogan and other counties erroneously adopted measures to restrict the cooperative's purchase of wheat on their behalf. For example, the Huangpi County Grain Bureau suppressed the joint instruction of the Xiaogan Prefectural Grain Bureau and the cooperative regarding the agreement on purchasing wheat on their behalf for more than 20 days, and only signed the contract reluctantly when the prefecture sent people to the county for inspection. However, when the contract was issued to the county's branches, it was already late June, and the wheat purchase was coming to an end. The Xiaogan County Grain Bureau had only thirteen purchasing points in the county, such as Wangjiadian and Huayuan. The county cooperative originally planned to set up forty-seven key purchasing points in areas where the grain bureau did not have points, but the grain bureau only agreed to the cooperative setting up eleven purchasing points. Due to the small number of points, it could not meet the farmers' demands for selling wheat, resulting in crowded queues for selling wheat. In late June, the Qijiawan purchasing point of the Huangpi County Grain Bureau often had six or seven hundred people queuing up to sell wheat early in the morning. Farmers had to spend a whole day selling wheat and buying back daily necessities. The poor peasant Zhang Jinwa from Beizu Township, Xiaogan, carried a load of wheat to queue up for sale before dawn, hoping to sell it early and go back to collect lake grass (fertilizer), but he had to go through "four barriers" (selling wheat, exchanging money, buying rice, and getting rice), and it took more than two hours to pass one "barrier". Many farmers were very dissatisfied because queuing to sell wheat delayed production.

In many areas of the province, grain bureaus and cooperatives also have serious uncoordinated phenomena in terms of fund allocation and purchase prices. The Yunmeng Fifth District Cooperative's funds were sometimes not enough for a morning of wheat purchase; cadres of the Xiaogan Zougang Cooperative went to the warehouse of the Xiaojia Port Grain Bureau to receive funds and made suggestions to them. The warehouse director Fan Shangzhi said indifferently: "Lack of funds, suspension of purchases, queuing, and out of stock are common occurrences. Why are you cooperatives so anxious!" In terms of price, some local grain bureaus set higher prices for their own purchases and lower prices for the areas where cooperatives purchased on their behalf. For example, Xiaojia Port and Dougangbu in Xiaogan are only twelve li apart, but the prices differ by more than 6%. However, some cooperatives in the province did not comply with the purchase contracts in their proxy purchases. For example, the Echeng County Cooperative sold 50,000 jin of wheat purchased on their behalf to private merchants; some also falsely reported the number of proxy purchases, making it impossible for state-owned companies to accurately grasp the purchase situation.

The uncoordinated relationship between the state-owned grain departments and the cooperatives has caused great losses to the state's grain purchase work, and at the same time has given lawless private merchants loopholes to exploit. In Longdian, Yangjiahe and other places in Xiaogan County, lawless merchants suppressed prices for purchases, and private merchants in Changyan District, Huangpi, deceived farmers to obtain illegal profits.

The reason for the uncoordinated relationship between the grain departments and cooperatives in these areas is mainly that the cadres of the grain departments do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of supporting and relying on the cooperatives. For example, in some areas, the Huangpi County Grain Department would rather entrust the exchange to purchase than entrust the cooperative to purchase on its behalf; at the same time, the cooperative cadres' understanding of the fact that the cooperative should play the role of an assistant to state-owned commerce, overcome one-sided profit-seeking viewpoints, actively improve operations, reduce proxy purchase costs, and conscientiously implement national purchase tasks is also not clear enough. Therefore, the grain departments and cooperatives in these areas basically do not make necessary contacts and consultations on many issues, and blame each other when problems occur, forming a gap between units and between cadres.

Now the wheat purchase task is waiting for further efforts to be completed, and the grain, cotton, and tobacco purchase work is about to begin. Grain departments (and state-owned commercial departments) and cooperative departments at all levels should educate their subordinate cadres, quickly check and correct the above-mentioned uncoordinated phenomena, and hope that party and government leading organs and financial and economic committees at all levels will supervise and lead them in strengthening unity, specific division of labor, and close cooperation in order to complete the purchase tasks given by the state.

### 湖北省部分地区粮食部门和合作社部门  应即纠正购粮工作中的不协调现象

    湖北省部分地区粮食部门和合作社部门
    应即纠正购粮工作中的不协调现象
    湖北省黄陂、孝感、天门、云梦、鄂城等地区在国家收购粮食工作中，由于国营粮食部门与合作社部门关系不协调，致使购粮工作受到损失，引起农民不满。
    在麦收季节，黄陂、孝感等县粮食局错误地采取了限制合作社代购小麦的办法。如黄陂县粮食局将孝感专署粮食局和合作社关于代购小麦协议的联合指示压了二十多天，等到专署派人到县检查时才勉强签订合同。但当合同再发至县的分支机构时，已是六月下旬，购麦已至尾声。孝感县粮食局在全县只有王家店、花园等十三个收购点，该县合作社原准备在粮食局没有设点的地区设置四十七个重点收购处，但粮食局只同意合作社设十一个收购处。由于设点太少，不能适应农民售麦的要求，造成了排队售麦的拥挤现象。黄陂县粮食局祁家湾收购处六月下旬经常一清早排队售麦的就达六、七百人。农民卖了小麦买回生活资料就得费一天功夫。孝感北咀乡贫农张金娃天没亮就挑了一担小麦去排队出卖，指望早点卖了回去打湖草（肥料），那晓得要挨过“四关”（卖麦、兑款、买米、取米），过一“关”就得两点多钟。很多农民都因卖麦排队耽误了生产而非常不满。
    该省不少地区的粮食局和合作社，在资金调拨和收购价格方面也有严重的不协调现象。云梦五区合作社的拨款有时还不够一个早上收购麦子用；孝感邹岗合作社干部到萧家港粮食局的仓库去领款，向他们提意见，该仓库主任樊尚志满不在乎地说：“缺款、停购、排队、脱销，这是经常的事，你们合作社着什么急！”在价格上，有的地区粮食局将自己收购的地方价格订得高些，而将合作社代购地区的价格订得低些。如孝感萧家港和陡岗埠只隔十二里路，价格就相差百分之六以上。但该省个别合作社在代购中不遵守代购合同，甚至如鄂城县合作社就把代购的小麦五万斤卖给私商；也有的假报代购数字，使得国营公司无法正确掌握收购情况。
    国营粮食部门与合作社的不协调，给国家购粮工作造成了很大损失，同时还给不法私商钻了空子。孝感县龙店、杨家河等地不法商人压价收购，黄陂长堰区私商蒙哄农民，从中获取非法利润。
    这些地区的粮食部门与合作社不协调的原因，主要是粮食部门的干部对扶助和依靠合作社的重要性认识不足，如黄陂县粮食部门在某些地区宁愿委托交易所收购，而不愿委托合作社代购；同时，合作社干部对于合作社应该发挥国营商业的助手作用，克服片面的营利观点、积极改善经营、降低代购费用、认真执行国家收购任务等等思想也不够明确。因而这些地区的粮食部门与合作社对很多问题就根本不作必要的联系和商量，在发生问题时就互相埋怨，形成了单位与单位间，干部与干部间的隔阂。
    现在购麦任务正待进一步努力完成，购粮、购棉、购烟工作即将开始，各级粮食部门（还有国营商业部门）和合作社部门应该教育所属干部，迅速检查和纠正上述种种不协调现象，并希望各级党政领导机关、财经委员会及时监督与领导他们加强团结，具体分工，密切配合，为完成国家给予的收购任务而努力。    （靳吾）
