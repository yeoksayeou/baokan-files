    A Farmer's Economic Life After the Wheat Harvest
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Feng Jian
    In late May, the wheat in Dushan Township, Echeng County, Hubei Province, matured. This area is a major grain-producing region in eastern Hubei. Like many farmers, Liu Caihua, a member of an agricultural production mutual aid team, achieved a wheat harvest unseen in years. The four mu of wheat land he cultivated yielded a total of 1,899 jin of wheat. One high-yield wheat plot produced 508 jin per mu.

    This year's wheat price was 15% higher than last year. The increased income encouraged Liu Caihua to expand his investment in production. After the wheat harvest, it was the season for topdressing cotton. After harvesting the wheat, Liu Caihua sold seven-tenths of the remaining wheat to the nearby supply and marketing cooperative, after setting aside seed, paying the agricultural tax, and providing for his family's consumption. From the cooperative, he exchanged the wheat for 600 jin of soybean cake, sesame cake, and 10 jin of chemical fertilizer. Thus, adding to the base fertilizer already applied to the cotton fields, this year's fertilizer application to the cotton fields increased by more than 70% compared to last year. After selling the wheat, he also purchased some sickles, carrying poles, and winnowing fans for harvesting intermediate rice.

    One evening in early August, Liu Caihua took out three daily account books from his house and, standing on the threshing ground, told me about his family's life after the wheat harvest. In the past two months, his family had bought more than five zhang of grey cotton cloth, white cotton cloth, and various printed fabrics from nearby market towns, and made new clothes for all six members of the family. According to Liu Caihua's account books, the increased income from this year's wheat price was enough to cover the cost of making these new clothes. In the two months since the wheat harvest, his family had spent an average of more than 2,000 yuan per day, buying salt, oil, brown sugar, tea, matches, and kerosene from the market towns. Liu Caihua enthusiastically pointed out to me that in his three tile-roofed houses, two rooms already had a mezzanine floor built with new planks, which he had also bought after selling the wheat. In addition, Liu Caihua spent 40,000 yuan to buy a bamboo mat, a goose feather fan, and some Sichuan white fungus, expenditures rarely seen in his family for many years.

    In mid-August, Liu Caihua began harvesting intermediate rice in earnest. His Dai-character cotton was growing vigorously, with more than ten cotton bolls on each plant. This year, his cotton planting area was neither expanded nor reduced, but the amount of fertilizer applied had increased, and the yield per unit area was likely to improve. He recently bought another bundle of reeds, preparing to weave them for drying cotton. This year, the price of new rice in this area was also about 17% higher than last year. Liu Caihua said, "When the new rice and cotton are available in large quantities, I will buy more fertilizer in preparation for winter planting and spring plowing."

    一个农家收麦后的经济生活
    新华社记者  冯健
    五月末，湖北省鄂城县杜山乡的小麦成熟了。这一带是鄂东的主要粮食产区，和许多农民一样，农业生产互助组组员刘才华获得了多年来未有的小麦丰收。他种的四亩麦地共打麦子一千八百九十九斤，其中一块丰产麦地，每亩收了麦子五百零八斤。
    今年小麦价格比去年提高了一成半，收益的增加鼓舞着刘才华扩大了生产的投资。麦收以后正是棉花追肥的季节，刘才华收了麦子，除了留种籽、缴公粮和吃用的以外，余下的十分之七的小麦都卖给了附近的供销合作社，并从合作社换回了六百斤豆饼、麻饼和十斤化学肥料。这样加上原来在棉地里施的底肥，今年对棉花地的施肥量就比去年增加七成以上。他在卖出小麦以后，还添置了一些收割中稻用的镰刀、扁担、簸箕。
    八月上旬的一个黄昏，刘才华从他屋里取出三本日用流水账，站在打谷场上，对我述说麦收后他一家人的生活。两个多月来，他家从附近集镇上买回了五丈多灰洋布、白洋布和各种花布，给全家大小六口添置了新衣。按刘才华的流水账计算一下，今年麦价的提高给他家增加的收益，已足够裁制这批新衣了。麦收后的两个多月来，他家每天平均要用去二千多元，从集镇上买回盐、油、红糖、茶叶、火柴和煤油等。刘才华饶有兴致地指引给我看，在他的三间瓦屋里，已有两间用新木板搭起了一层楼板，这些木板也是他卖出小麦后新买来的。此外，刘才华还用去四万元买了一条竹席、一把鹅毛扇和一点四川银耳，这已是他家多年少有的开支。
    八月中旬，刘才华紧张地开镰收割中稻了，他的岱字棉长得茁壮，每株已有十多个棉桃。今年他的棉花播种面积没有扩大，也没有缩小，但是施肥量增多了，单位面积产量有可能提高。新近他又买了一捆芦苇，准备织起来晒棉花用。今年这一带新谷价格也比去年提高了百分之十七左右。刘才华说：“等到新稻、棉花大量到手，我还要多买些肥料，准备冬种、春耕。”
