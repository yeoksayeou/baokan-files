The spring disaster relief and lambing work in pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, Northwest China, and Suiyuan has achieved remarkable results. In Inner Mongolia, the disaster relief and lambing work began around the Qingming Festival and is now in the final stage in most areas. The survival rate of young animals is generally above 90%, with some areas reaching 100%. The Jin Ge Pastoral Mutual Aid Group in Xinba Right Banner successfully completed the lambing work by the end of April, delivering over 1,000 lambs, all of which survived. In the Daodemiao and Hanmiao Nuutuk of Alukeerqin Banner, the vast number of herdsmen organized 123 lambing mutual aid groups, built more than 490 sheds, and prepared 47 felt bags and 43 baskets, providing warm shelters for 302 newborn calves and 1,550 lambs. All young animals have survived. In Qitai County, Xinjiang Province, two pastoral areas produced 16,146 lambs this year, with a survival rate of 96%. In the fourth district and fifth township of Tuoli County, the survival rate of foals this year was 97%, and the survival rate of calves was 99.5%. In the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Haiyan County, Qinghai Province, the lambing rate and lamb survival rate were both above 90% due to the adoption of artificial insemination. Zhang Delin, a model shepherd in the Songshan pastoral area of the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region in Gansu Province, is particularly successful because he prepares winter forage for his sheep every year, pays attention to the hygiene of the sheepfolds, grazes them in separate groups, and provides lambing rooms for ewes and warm sheds for nursing lambs. His flock has grown particularly fast. This year, his 106 ewes gave birth to 108 lambs (one ewe gave birth to triplets), and all survived. Lambing work has been fully launched in Suiyuan Province, with widespread increases in lambing rates and young animal survival rates. Lambing work has also begun in Ningxia Province, where herdsmen are carrying out a patriotic competition to increase livestock and protect livestock, with the main focus on improving the survival rate of young animals. According to local conditions, ewes giving birth to twins account for more than 20% this year; newborn lambs are strong, generally weighing three to four kilograms. As of April 14, in the sixth district of Sulai County, Xinjiang Province, 35% of the 2,972 ewes inseminated in 1952 had given birth, with twins accounting for 20%. In the first village of the second township of the seventh district of Qitai County, 51 ewes were artificially inseminated last year, and all have given birth, with five ewes giving birth to twins. Thanks to the promotion of artificial insemination and the good livestock protection work during the past winter, the pregnancy rate has generally increased in various places. According to a survey conducted by the Yili Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Xinjiang Province in Gongliu, Xinyuan, Zhaosu, and other counties, the conception rate of mating fine-wool sheep and Lana sheep is above 80% in various places, and the conception rate of fine-wool sheep in Zhaosu County even reached 90%. The lambs produced are of particularly good quality. For example, herdsmen in the first village of the first township of the sixth district of Sulai County reported: "In the past, the lambs born to our fine-wool sheep weighed at most six jin, but these lambs weighed more than nine jin at birth and grew very strong. They could stand up in less than 20 minutes and could feed themselves (local lambs generally take two hours to stand up and slowly learn to feed themselves), just like small calves."

The main reasons for the good lambing work in the pastoral areas this spring are, first of all, that the Party committees and governments at all levels have given sufficient attention to this work and strengthened organizational leadership. On February 27 this year, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region issued a special instruction to do a good job in disaster relief and lambing, pointing out that doing a good job in the current disaster relief and lambing work should become the overriding central task in the pastoral areas. It also pointed out: "The key to doing a good job in disaster relief and lambing work lies in overcoming paralysis, complacency, blind optimism, and pessimistic disappointment, and the negative emotions of listening to fate, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, immediately mobilizing all possible forces, resolutely relying on the masses, and doing all the preparatory work to welcome the lambing work." In order to give full play to the production enthusiasm and creativity of the herdsmen, April was designated as "Young Animal Protection Movement Month" in the pastoral areas. Subsequently, the Party committees and people's governments of various leagues and banners also issued special instructions, convened various meetings, and carried out publicity and education; and organized appropriate forces to help herdsmen solve difficulties and mobilize and organize disaster relief and lambing mutual aid groups, and check the preparatory work for lambing; local trade authorities and cooperatives were required to immediately fully prepare and supply herdsmen with urgently needed wind and snow protection equipment, animal feed, and various medicines. The Animal Husbandry Department of the People's Government of Xinjiang Province also issued instructions to strengthen the lambing and breeding work of Lana sheep. The Animal Husbandry Department of Xinjiang Province also selected technical cadres to go to the countryside to guide the work. The three key areas of Dihua, Tacheng, and Yili organized 22 lambing work teams and carried a large number of medicines, equipment, etc. to carry out work in various pastoral areas. The Yikezhao League Committee of the Communist Party of China in Suiyuan Province instructed the Party committees of its subordinate banners and counties to pay attention to this work and ensure the smooth development of the patriotic livestock increase and protection competition. The second is that the production enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of herdsmen have been improved, their tireless labor, and the role of organization has been brought into play. Under the leadership of the winter and spring committees, the vast number of herdsmen in most pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia have organized disaster relief and lambing mutual aid groups and have done a good job in preparing for the work. For example, Xinba Right Banner carried out the work of removing artemisia and snow in the winter camps, cleared 921 winter camps, and dried them to prevent livestock from suffering miscarriages or becoming weak due to cold at night. The whole banner organized 92 mutual aid groups and 338 "Huerqi" (disaster relief and lambing groups), accounting for 96.1% of the total number of herding households. It also prepared 9,000 pieces of feed bean cake, 206 double-layered sheepfolds, and 301 carts. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient manpower, the method of "group lambing and group rearing" was implemented during the lambing period, so that ewes, young animals, and all sheep flocks were taken care of. The vast number of herdsmen in many pastoral areas of Xinjiang Province are also working intensively for disaster relief and lambing. Generally, herdsmen feed their sheep very well and made full preparations before lambing. During the lambing period, they take care of the ewes day and night to ensure the safety of the ewes and lambs. The third very important reason is that the overwintering work last year was done well. Many pastoral areas did a good job in fattening sheep last year, strictly controlled the mating period, prepared sufficient feed for the winter, and built sheds and pens, which not only enabled the sheep to maintain strong physical strength after the severe winter but also increased the pregnancy rate. However, there are also a few individual areas where the spring lambing work this year has not been done well, causing great losses to livestock. For example, according to incomplete statistics from five Nuutuk in Aluke Banner, Inner Mongolia, 1,040 lambs and 313 calves were aborted or died from diarrhea. The main reasons why the lambing work was not done well are the opposite of the above three conditions. The local Party committees and people's governments did not pay enough attention to this work, and many necessary tasks that should have been led by the herdsmen (such as feeding, sheds, and organizing manpower) were not done well, and the overwintering work last year was not done well, which affected the health of the livestock.

The lambing work is coming to an end, and thousands of young animals have been born, which is the basis for increasing livestock production. Doing a good job in raising young animals is one of the important tasks of various pastoral areas at present. If this work is not paid attention to, disasters will occur during the growth of young animals, causing major losses.

    各牧业地区今年抗灾接羔工作有很大成绩
    内蒙古、西北、绥远等地牧业区群众性的春季抗灾接羔工作，已获得显著成绩。内蒙古各地抗灾接羔工作，自清明节前后开始，现在大部地区已进入接羔工作的结束阶段，幼畜成活率大都在百分之九十以上，有的地区幼畜成活率竟达百分之百。新巴右旗金戈牧业互助组，接羔工作在四月底胜利结束，接羊羔一千余只，全部成活。阿鲁科尔沁旗道德庙、罕庙努图克广大牧民，组织起一百二十三个接羔互助组，盖起四百九十余处窝棚，准备了四十七个毡袋和四十三个背筐，使刚生下来的三百零二头牛犊和一千五百五十只羊羔有了暖和的窝棚，全部幼畜都已成活。新疆省奇台县两个牧业区今年生产一万六千一百四十六只羊羔，成活率达百分之九十六。托里县四区五乡今年马驹的成活率为百分之九十七，牛犊的成活率达百分之九十九点五。青海省海晏县藏族自治区因采用了人工授精法，产羔率和羊羔成活率都在百分之九十以上。甘肃省天祝藏族自治区松山牧业区的牧民养羊育羔特等模范张德林，因为他每年都给羊准备冬季草料，注意羊圈卫生，分群放牧和给母羊设有产羔房及保育羊羔的暖棚，他的羊群发展得特别快，今年的一百零六只母羊生了一百零八只羊羔（其中一只母羊一胎产三羔），且全部成活。绥远省接羔工作已全面开展，产羔率及幼畜成活率都普遍提高。宁夏省也开始了接羔工作，牧民正开展爱国主义的增畜保畜竞赛运动，并以提高幼畜成活率作为竞赛的主要内容。根据各地情况，今年产双羔的母羊约占百分之二十以上；新生羊羔健壮，一般都有三、四公斤重。新疆省绥来县第六区截至四月十四日止，一九五二年全区输精的二千九百七十二只母羊中，百分之三十五已经产羔，其中产双羔的占百分之二十。奇台县第七区二乡一村去年用人工授精法共配了五十一只母羊，已全部产羔，其中有五只母羊产了双羔。由于推广了人工授精法及去年过冬时保畜工作做得好，各地保胎率都普遍提高。据新疆省伊犁专署在巩留、新源、昭苏等县的调查，各地绵羊和蓝哈羊种羊交配后，受胎率都在百分之八十以上，昭苏县绵羊的受胎率更达百分之九十。所产羊羔，体质特别好。如绥来县六区一乡一村牧民反映说：过去我们的绵羊生下的羊羔，顶多不过六斤，但这些羊羔生下来的体重就九斤多重，长的很壮实，不到二十分钟就能站起来，自己还能吃奶（当地一般羊羔生下来，两小时后才能站起来，慢慢的才学会吃奶），真和小牛犊一样。
    各地牧业区今春的接羔工作做得较好的主要原因，首先是因为各级党委和各级人民政府对这项工作给予了足够的重视，加强了组织领导工作。内蒙古自治区人民政府为做好抗灾接羔工作，在今年二月二十七日发出了专门指示，指出做好当前的抗灾接羔工作，应成为牧业区压倒一切的中心任务。并指出：做好抗灾接羔工作的关键，在于克服麻痹大意、盲目乐观情绪和悲观失望、听天由命的消极情绪，发挥群众的积极性、创造性，把可能动员的力量立即动员起来，坚决依靠群众，做好一切准备工作，以迎接接羔工作。为了充分发挥牧民的生产积极性和创造性，在牧业区规定今年四月为“保育幼畜运动月”。随后各盟、旗党委和人民政府也都发出了专门指示，召开各种会议，进行宣传教育；并组织适当力量，帮助牧民解决困难和动员组织抗灾接羔互助组，检查接羔的准备工作；要求当地贸易机关、合作社，立即充分准备供应牧民迫切需要的防风雪设备、畜料以及各种药品等。新疆省人民政府畜牧厅为加强配种蓝哈羊的产羔及保育工作也发出了指示。新疆省畜牧厅还选派了技术干部下乡指导工作。迪化、塔城、伊犁三个重点专区组织了二十二个接羔工作组，并携带大批药品、器材等，深入各牧业区进行工作。中共绥远省伊克昭盟地委会指示所属各旗、县委重视这件工作，保证爱国主义增畜保畜竞赛运动的顺利开展。其次是广大牧民的生产积极性和创造性的提高，日夜不息的劳动，发挥了组织起来的作用。内蒙古大部牧业区的广大牧民在过冬过春委员会的领导下，组织了抗灾接羔互助组，做好了准备工作。如新巴右旗在冬营盘上进行了除蒿子、除雪等工作，扫除了九百二十一个冬营盘，并将其晒干，使牲畜过夜不因受凉而遭流产或瘦弱。全旗共组织九十二个互助小组及三百三十八个“互尔其”（抗灾接羔小组），占牧户总数的百分之九十六点一。还准备了饲料豆饼九千块，双层羊圈二百零六个，车子三百零一辆。为了解决人力不足的困难，在接羔期实行了“分群接羔，分群寄养”的办法，使母羊、幼畜及所有羊群都得到照顾。新疆省许多牧业区的广大牧民也为抗灾接羔而紧张地工作。一般牧民都把羊喂得很肥，在产羔前作了充分的准备，产羔期间不分日夜照看母羊产羔，保证了母羊和羊羔的安全。第三个很重要的原因是去年过冬工作做得好。许多牧业区去年的羊抓秋膘抓的好，严格控制了交配期，冬季准备了足够的饲养，搭盖了棚圈，不仅使羊在寒冬之后仍保持着健壮的体力，且使保胎率提高。但是，也有极个别地区今年春季接羔工作做得不够好，使牲畜遭受了很大损失。如内蒙古阿鲁旗五个努图克据不完全统计，流产及幼畜下痢死亡的有羊羔一千零四十只，牛犊三百一十三头。接羔工作做得不好的主要原因，正和上述三个条件相反，是当地中共党委和人民政府对这项工作重视不够，应该领导牧民作的许多必须要做的工作（如饲养、棚圈和组织人力）没有做好，去年过冬工作也做得不好，因而影响了牲畜的健康。
    接羔工作即将结束，成千上万的幼畜已降生，这是畜牧业增产的基础。做好保育幼畜工作是各牧业区当前重要任务之一，如不注意这一工作，幼畜在成长过程中将会发生灾害，造成重大损失。
