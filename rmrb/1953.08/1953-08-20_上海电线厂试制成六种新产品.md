The state-owned Shanghai Wire Factory used to manufacture products according to British and American standards. At the end of last year, the factory decided to learn from advanced Soviet experience and switch to using Soviet standards for the trial manufacture of its main products. Thanks to the high level of enthusiasm of all factory workers and the continuous and diligent research of the technical staff, after half a year of trial production, six products have been successfully trial-produced in full accordance with Soviet standards and manufacturing procedures: three-core grounded mining cables, three-core sector-shaped paper-insulated power cables, 1.13 and 2.73 single-core sulfur-free rubber insulation, 100-square-millimeter double-grooved trolley wire, and 600-pair telephone cables. According to the annual production volume statistics for these six main products, the country can save more than 30 billion yuan. Moreover, the service life is much longer than that of products manufactured according to British and American standards. For example, the 600-pair telephone cable, manufactured according to British and American standards, requires six pairs of spare lines in each telephone cable, and the copper-clad insulating paper needs to be in four colors; now, using Soviet standards, it is sufficient to have only three pairs of spare lines in each cable, and the color of the insulating paper can be reduced to two, which can save a large amount of copper and insulating paper. Another example is the new China’s first double-grooved trolley wire successfully trial-produced by the factory. According to British and American standards, the grooves for manufacturing trolley wires are opened in the middle, occupying half the diameter, while the current Soviet standard places the grooves at only about one-third of the diameter. This not only ensures the safety of the trolley during operation but also increases the contact surface of the pulley, and the service life can also be greatly increased.

Through this trial production of new products, the factory's technical staff have further realized the superiority of advanced Soviet technology. The entire factory is now actively preparing to comprehensively learn from advanced Soviet technology.

    上海电线厂试制成六种新产品
    国营上海电线厂过去一向是根据英美的规范制造产品。去年年底，该厂决定学习苏联先进经验，将主要产品改用苏联规范试制。由于全厂职工发挥了高度的劳动热情，技术人员不断地刻苦钻研，经过了半年来的试制，已经有三芯连地的矿用电缆、三芯扇形纸绝缘电力电缆、一根一·一三和一根二·七三的无硫橡皮绝缘、一百平方公厘双沟形电车线，和六百对电话电缆等六种产品，完全根据苏联的规范和制造程序试制成功。根据这六种主要产品一年的生产量统计，可替国家节约三百多亿元。而且使用的寿命也大大超过按英美规范制造的产品。如六百对的电话电缆，根据英美规范制造，每一根电话电缆内要有六对预备线，包铜的绝缘纸要用四种颜色；现在采用了苏联规范，一根线内只要做三对预备线就足够使用，绝缘纸的颜色改用二种就够了，可节省大量的铜料和绝缘纸。又如该厂试制成功的新中国第一根双沟形电车线，根据英美规范，制造电车线的沟槽是开在占直径一半的中间，而现在苏联的标准是将沟槽开在只占直径三分之一左右的地方，这样不但保证了电车在行驶时的安全，同时也增加了滑轮的接触面，使用的年限也可以大大增加。
    通过这次新产品的试制，使该厂的技术人员进一步体会到苏联先进技术的优越性。现在全厂正积极地准备全面学习苏联的先进技术。
