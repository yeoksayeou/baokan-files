How to Increase Sweet Potato Yield and Prevent Rotting
Central Agricultural Ministry's Grain Production Department

Sweet potato (red potato, red yam, sweet potato) is a high-yielding and reliable crop. It is widely adaptable to different regions and not particularly demanding in terms of soil or fertility. It is also relatively easy to cultivate and propagate. The tubers are delicious and can be used to make noodles and alcohol. Therefore, in disaster areas or densely populated areas with limited land, sweet potatoes are popular with the masses and serve as a staple food in winter and spring. Anhui farmers have a saying: "Harvesting sweet potatoes provides half a year's worth of food."

This year, wheat crops have suffered, and the government is calling on the masses to actively engage in self-reliance production, planting more sweet potatoes and melons. The sweet potato planting area has expanded compared to previous years. Agricultural production leadership at all levels must strengthen leadership over sweet potato production to ensure increased sweet potato yields this autumn and strive to reduce losses.

In many areas, sweet potato cultivation is extensive. Generally, planting is sparse, fertilization is minimal or non-existent, seedling cultivation is not meticulous, and transplanting is late, resulting in low yields. Currently, in most areas, sweet potato transplanting has been completed, and there is no time to improve varieties or spacing. To strive for a good sweet potato harvest this year, the focus should be on topdressing fertilizer, earthing up, and doing a good job in field management. According to the experience of the people of northern Jiangsu, unfertilized sweet potatoes yield only a few hundred catties per mu, while those fertilized with one thousand catties can yield over two thousand catties per mu. If the masses can be effectively mobilized to apply some topdressing fertilizer to the sweet potato fields, yields can be greatly increased. Whatever type of fertilizer is used, it should be fully decomposed. The amount can be determined based on local conditions. Grass ash contains a large amount of potassium fertilizer. If one hundred to two hundred catties of grass ash can be applied per mu of sweet potato field, it can not only improve yield and quality but also enhance storage capacity (grass ash should not be mixed with human manure for application, as this will greatly reduce fertilizer effectiveness). The earlier the fertilization, the better. It is best to apply fertilizer around the plants or in holes between plants, covering the fertilizer after application. Spreading it broadly on the ground is wasteful.

Hoeing and earthing up should be frequent, with small amounts each time. In waterlogged areas, ridging and ditching are even more important, as this can avoid or mitigate waterlogging damage. Last year, some farmers in northern Anhui used this method to ensure their harvest. Those who did not adopt this method mostly had their sweet potatoes rot in the ground. The sweet potatoes planted in the disaster areas of Jiangsu and Anhui are mostly long-vined local varieties, which need to be turned over appropriately. However, when turning the vines, care should be taken not to use too much force, so as not to hinder growth. As for the newly promoted Nanrui Sweet Potato, Victory No. 100, and Agricultural and Forestry No. 4, they do not need to be turned over. In rainy areas, it is enough to lift the vines two or three times.

Losses due to improper harvesting and storage of sweet potatoes are significant. Last year, about forty billion catties of sweet potatoes rotted throughout the country. Especially in the northern Anhui area, due to excessive autumn rains, late harvests rotted in the ground. The main reasons for sweet potato rot are late harvesting, excessive bruising, high groundwater levels, or temperature imbalances after storage. These issues should be addressed and improved in the future.

Many farmers are accustomed to harvesting sweet potatoes after frost, believing that this results in larger tubers, better taste, and better storage. In fact, sweet potatoes are crops that thrive in high temperatures. Tubers will suffer frost damage below six degrees Celsius. Therefore, harvesting after frost, excessively cold weather, or failure to store them in time will reduce the storage capacity of sweet potatoes. According to surveys, sweet potato growth is extremely slow after late September. Especially after frost, the stems and leaves die, making further growth impossible. It is also true that tubers harvested after frost taste better due to starch conversion; however, early harvested tubers can also achieve this through storage. Therefore, it is necessary to have a good discussion with the masses and appropriately grasp the harvest time. Harvesting too early may affect yield, while harvesting too late may easily cause rot and losses. In the north, harvesting should be done after the Cold Dew solar term and before the Frost's Descent solar term, avoiding harvesting after severe frost. In the Huai River basin, harvesting should be done within three to five days before and after the Frost's Descent solar term, avoiding autumn rain and sweet potato rot. In the north, harvesting after the Cold Dew solar term and before the Frost's Descent solar term is not a problem, and the masses have experience. However, in the Huai River basin, the period from the Cold Dew solar term to around the Frost's Descent solar term is also the wheat planting season, and harvesting is often delayed due to wheat planting. This requires strengthened leadership and appropriate adjustment of labor to seize the time for harvesting once the Frost's Descent solar term arrives. In case of early frost, the main stem of the vines should be cut off immediately where it enters the soil to prevent bacteria from entering through the frozen areas. The cut vines should not be removed immediately but left on the ground to maintain ground temperature. Digging the potatoes should be done after the weather improves. Harvesting sweet potatoes should be done on a sunny day, preferably after several consecutive sunny days when the soil is relatively dry. Sweet potatoes dug at this time are easier to store. Digging should be done carefully, minimizing damage to the tubers. Handle them gently and carefully after digging, and do not remove the stem (bottom stem), to prevent bacteria from entering and causing rot. Before putting them into the cellar, carefully select the potatoes, choosing those with injuries or diseases that cannot be stored for immediate consumption, and carefully place the others in the cellar. The practice of pulling them in with large carts and dumping them all at once into the cellar is not good.

The terrain in the disaster areas of Jiangsu and Anhui is low-lying. In case of rain, the groundwater level rises, and the sweet potatoes stored in the cellar will be greatly threatened. To avoid this phenomenon, attention should be paid to digging cellars in high and dry places, and the method of above-ground storage should be studied with the masses. Management after entering the cellar is also very important. The cellar should not be overfilled with potatoes. It is best to leave one-quarter to one-third of the space empty for inspection and management. When sweet potatoes first enter the cellar, respiration (i.e., "sweating") proceeds rapidly, the temperature in the cellar is high, and the humidity is high. Evaporated water drips on the sweet potatoes, which will cause rot. Therefore, the vents in the cellar should be kept open during this period. Some farmers spread chaff or fine sand on the potatoes to prevent evaporated water from dripping on them, which is also a good method. Around the Beginning of Winter solar term, the cellar doors should be closed as the weather gets colder, and the soil should be gradually built up to keep warm.

The cellar door should be opened in a sunny place, and it is best to choose a sunny and windless noon to take out the potatoes. The number of times the cellar is opened should be minimized, and the door should be closed at any time when entering or leaving the cellar to avoid severe cold and increase losses.

Because the temperature and humidity are different in various places, and the groundwater level is also different, the methods and experiences of sweet potato storage will not be exactly the same. Therefore, all localities must proceed from local conditions, conduct in-depth investigations and study the existing "rot-proof cellar" experiences and principles among the masses, and mobilize the masses to find ways to store sweet potatoes well.

Because sweet potatoes are afraid of moisture and frost and are not easy to store, many farmers have long created a method of slicing and drying them. Harvesting is done when the weather is sunny, and slicing and drying are done with a slicer board while harvesting. This not only solves the difficulty of storage but also increases the uses for consumption and processing. This method can be vigorously promoted.

    怎样使甘薯多收、不烂
    中央农业部粮食生产司
    甘薯（红薯、红芋、苕）是一种高产保收的作物，地区的适应性很广，对土壤、肥力的选择也不严格，栽培繁殖比较容易；薯块很好吃，又可制粉条、做酒精。因此，在灾区或人多地少的地区，甘薯为广大群众所欢迎，成为冬春两季的主要口粮。安徽农民有“收了红芋半年粮”的说法。
    今年小麦受了灾，政府号召群众积极生产自救，多种甘薯和瓜菜，甘薯种植面积比往年扩大了。各级农业生产领导机关必须加强对甘薯生产的领导，保证今秋甘薯增产，力争减少损失。
    许多地区的甘薯的栽培是粗放的，一般情况是种得稀、施肥少或不施肥，育苗不讲究，扦插得又晚，所以产量不高。目前绝大部分地区的甘薯都已扦插完毕，要从品种、株行距等方面去改进，已经来不及了。为了争取今年甘薯丰收，只有抓紧追肥、培土，做好田间管理工作。根据苏北群众的经验，不施肥的甘薯，每亩只收数百斤；施肥一千斤的，每亩可收到二千斤以上。如能很好地动员群众往甘薯地里施一些追肥，就可以大大提高产量。所用的肥料，不论是那一种，都应该是充分腐熟的；数量可以根据各地具体条件来决定。草木灰里含有大量的钾肥；如果每亩甘薯地能施上一百斤到二百斤的草木灰，不但可以提高产量质量，还可以增强贮藏能力（草木灰不能和人粪尿混合施用，因为这样会大大减低肥效）。施肥时期越早越好。施肥最好施在植株四周，或是在两株之间开穴，把肥料施下后再盖上；普遍地撒在地里是浪费的。
    中耕培土应勤，每次培土应少。在内涝地区，培垅挖沟更重要，因为这样可以避免或减轻涝害。去年皖北部分农民曾用这个方法，保证了自己的收成。没有采用这个方法的，甘薯大都烂在地里。苏皖灾区种植的甘薯多半是长蔓的本地种，这些品种需要适当翻蔓；但翻蔓时应该注意不要用力太猛，免得妨碍了它的生长。至于新推广的南瑞苕、胜利百号、农林四号等，就不需要翻蔓；在多雨的地区，只要提蔓两三次就行了。
    甘薯因收获和贮藏不当所遭的损失是严重的。去年各地甘薯腐烂约达四十亿斤。特别在皖北一带，因秋雨过多，收获晚的在地里就烂掉了。甘薯腐烂的主要原因是收获过晚、碰伤多、地下水位过高或入窖后温度失调。今后应针对这些问题加以改进。
    很多农民习惯在霜后才收获甘薯，认为这样的甘薯块头大、口味好、耐贮存。其实甘薯是喜欢高温的作物，薯块在摄氏六度以下就会受冻害。因此，霜后收获，天气过冷或不能及时贮藏，都会减低甘薯贮藏能力。根据调查，九月下旬以后，甘薯生长是极其缓慢的。特别在霜后，茎叶死亡，更无生长的可能。霜后收获薯块，由于淀粉转化作用，口味较好，也是事实；但早收薯块经过贮藏也能达到这个目的。因此，要很好地和群众商量，适当地掌握收获的时间。过早收获可能影响产量，过晚了就容易引起腐烂造成损失。北方应在寒露后，霜降前收获，力避严霜后收获；在淮河流域应在霜降前后三五天内收获，力避秋雨烂薯。北方在寒露后霜降前收获是没有问题的，群众也有经验；但是在淮河流域，寒露至霜降前后正是种麦季节，往往因种麦耽误收获，这就需要加强领导，适当地调剂劳动力，霜降一到就抓紧时间收获。如遇早霜，可马上把蔓子的主干入土的地方割断，以免病菌自受冻处侵入。割断的蔓子不要马上拿掉，仍留在地上，以保持地温；等天气转好即行挖薯。收获甘薯应选择晴朗天气，最好是连晴了数日，土地比较干燥时进行，这时掘出的甘薯比较容易贮存。掘时要小心，尽量使薯块少受伤害；掘出后也要注意轻拿轻放，不要将薯梗（底茎捌子）除去，以免病菌侵入引起腐烂。入窖以前还应耐心地作好选薯工作，把有伤有病不能贮存的薯块选出先吃，其他的则小心地放在窖里。那种用大车拉来就一下子倒在窖里的方法是不好的。
    苏皖灾区地势低洼，一遇阴雨，地下水位上升，窖内贮藏的甘薯就要受到很大威胁。为了避免这种现象，应注意在高燥地方挖窖，并要和群众研究地上贮藏的办法。入窖后的管理也是很重要的。窖内放置薯块不宜过满，最好还能留出四分之一到三分之一的空隙，以便检查、管理。当甘薯初入窖时，呼吸作用（即“发汗”）进行得很快，窖内温度高、湿度大，蒸发水分滴在甘薯上，就会引起腐烂。所以这一时期窖的气孔都应敞开；有些农民把糠或细砂铺在薯上，防止蒸发出的水滴在薯上，也是很好的办法。立冬前后要随着天气的寒冷开始封闭窖门，并逐渐培土，作好保温工作。
    窖门要开在向阳的地方，取薯时最好选晴朗无风的中午，开窖次数要尽量减少，出入窖要随时封门，以免严寒侵袭，增加损失。
    由于各地温度湿度不同，地下水位高低也不同，甘薯贮藏的办法和经验也不会完全相同。因此，各地必须因地制宜，深入调查研究群众中已有的“不烂窖”的经验和道理，发动群众想办法把甘薯贮藏好。
    因为甘薯怕湿怕冻，不易贮藏，所以早有很多农民创造了切片晒干的办法。在收获时正值天气晴朗，一面收获一面用擦片板切片晒干，这样不仅可解决贮藏的困难，而且可以增多食用和加工的用途。这种办法可以大力推广。
