    The Ocean is Smiling, the Fish are Jumping
    —A Record of the Spring Fishing Season's Grand Market at the Yantai Fishing Grounds
    Wang Hao
    Early summer is the most intense time of production for the spring fishing season's grand market in Yantai, when mackerel (also known as chub mackerel) swim in schools on the Yellow Sea surface. By early May, seven hundred sailing boats and nearly sixty motorized fishing boats were scattered on the sea near Yantai city. The small yellow croaker fishing season in April saw fishermen exceeding their production targets by 80 percent. This grand market is also seeing a great harvest.
    The fishermen here are making full use of old fishing tools (wind nets, sailing boats). Organized, the fishermen have begun to change their individual production methods. Modernized fishing boats are also actively working on the sea. In addition to the fishing boats of the Yantai Bohai Aquatic Products Company, Shandong Aquatic Products Marketing Company, and Shandong Aquatic Products Company, fishing boats from Shanghai, Liaodong, Dalian, and other aquatic products companies have also arrived. Most of them are using the "two fishing boats back-to-back encircling net" method of fishing (putting two boats together, with the net connected to the sterns, and when a school of fish is found, they separate and encircle them from both sides). The Japanese once tried this method but failed. After liberation, the fishermen and technicians of the Dalian Aquatic Products Company experimented many times and finally succeeded. From 1949 to the present, it has been gradually improved and has become the most effective working method for catching mackerel. Some sailing boats are also imitating this method.
    For the first few days of May, the weather wasn't very good; however, many fishing boats braved the wind and waves to fish. From May 1st to 22nd, six million catties of fish were brought to market. One group of fishermen, led by Li Daxi of Dongkou Village on Zhifu Island, caught 60,000 catties of fish. The Dalian No. 6 and No. 7 fishing boats, starting from the 15th, completed 193 percent of their May production targets in eight trips. On the 29th, many fishing boats caught 50,000 to 60,000 fish in one net, filling the fish holds and piling fish on the decks. The "Yu Gan" of the Shandong Aquatic Products Company caught 140,000 catties of fish in one day.

    The fishing grounds are thirty or forty nautical miles (over one hundred li) from Yantai city. The vast sea is dotted with various fishing boats. The two fishing boats using the "back-to-back encircling net" method sailed to the destination one after the other, first tying the two boats together with ropes and connecting the fishing nets piled on the sterns, proceeding side by side. At this time, the two "fishing captains" were perched high on the mastheads, looking for schools of fish, holding red flags to direct the operation. Look! In the deep blue sea, there are clusters of water waves wriggling, a deep purple color—that's a large school of fish! The red flag is waving, and the "fishing captain" is shouting: "Lean to the left!" "Lean to the right!" "Full speed!" "Slow speed!" "Cast the net! Quick!" In just two or three minutes, the two fishing boats separated and then came together again, and the school of fish was surrounded in the middle. Everyone on board threw themselves into the battle, throwing stones at the mouth of the net. "Don't let a single fish escape!" "Hit them! Hit them!" The whistle kept blowing, the steel cable car was cranking, and a dozen crew members in rubber skirts and boots were pulling the net on the stern. A solemn and joyful labor song resounded on the sea: "Heave-ho! Pull-ho! A big school of fish-ho! Pull hard-ho!" Sweat and seawater drenched their bodies, and the swimming school of fish delighted their hearts. Two sampans were sorting out the "floats" in the sea, driving the fish school into the net pool between the two boats like shepherds. The school of fish was running, darting, and the water was no longer transparent, all dark and heavy with fish. The people on the boat used "scoop nets" about five or six feet in diameter to scoop the fish into the hold. Each scoop of mackerel, weighing more than one catty each, held three or four hundred fish, and each net required dozens or hundreds of scoops. The fish fell into the hold, making a crackling sound, flashing with colorful silver light.
    One net, two nets..., until the fish filled the hold, until it was dark.
                                    ×  ×  ×
    The sea in the fishing port is calm, but the climax of the work competition is surging. Dockworkers are competing, workers at the processing plant cutting fish and salting them are competing, sailing boats are competing, and fishing boats are competing. As long as the weather is good, almost every morning there are news of production victories broadcast from the Fishing Port Committee. By the 29th, seven and a half of the twelve pairs of fishing boats of the Dalian Aquatic Products Company had hung up red flags for successfully completing their tasks. The production tasks of various aquatic products companies were not only completed but mostly exceeded. The Dalian No. 157 and No. 158 fishing boats, whose May task was 190 tons, had already reached more than 210 tons before the end of the month. The crew members said: We haven't caught up with boats No. 6 and No. 7 yet; we must catch up!
    On rainy days, there are few fish; however, if the water temperature is right, there will be large schools of fish. So even when the weather is not very good, the fishing boats still have to go to sea. When the wind and waves are too strong and fish cannot be found, they anchor in the sea to save fuel.
    This is the most leisurely time on the boat. The crew members squeeze into the cabin to seize the time to study culture. They cram to learn to read and write, acting as little teachers for each other; sometimes they gather in a pile to chat. Most of them have transferred from sailing boats to fishing boats, starting their lives at sea at the age of thirteen or fourteen, enduring the pain of seasickness and vomiting, often going hungry and fighting the wind and waves, and not catching a single fish all day. They hate the persecution of the Japanese imperialists and have turned their hatred into the strength of production and struggle now. Many crew members have participated in underground revolutionary struggles, and some crew members have participated in the heroic work of supporting the front lines of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. The gold-shining commemorative medals for the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea are hung in the wheelhouse of the captain of the Dalian No. 158 boat and in the engine room of the No. 14 truck. An atmosphere of revolutionary optimism permeates everyone's heart; the beautiful prospects of national construction powerfully attract them. A young fisherman said: "We will soon go to the ocean to hunt whales with cannons. In another two Five-Year Plans, the fishing boats will undergo a great change."
    This is true, this year is already different from previous years. In addition to the large number of fishing boats and fish catches in the Yantai Grand Market, there are also more people coming to intern and study. Many technicians, professors, and students from the Northeast Aquatic Products Experimental Farm, Shanghai Fisheries College, Hebei Aquatic Products Vocational School, and Shandong Yantai Aquatic Products School have come to visit and study on the fishing boats and in the factories, working alongside the workers. This is an important force for improving fishing technology and equipment.

    On a clear morning, the sea is as calm as a mirror, which is good weather for schools of fish to be active on the surface. Large teams of white sails, pairs of fishing boats, are sailing east on the sea. The breeze blows, and the seawater is full of smiling lines. The ocean is smiling, the fish are jumping. The sun rises from the east, and the sea is dotted with golden light; we are advancing on a road paved with gold.

    海洋在笑，鱼儿在跳
    ——记烟台渔场的春汛大海市
    王浩
    初夏，鲭鱼（又叫鲐鱼）成群在黄海海面浮游，这是烟台春汛大海市生产最紧张的时候。五月初，就有七百艘帆船和近六十艘机器渔轮散布在烟台市区附近的海面上了。四月份的黄花鱼小海市，渔民超过原计划百分之八十胜利地完成了生产任务。这次大海市，又是大丰收。
    这里的渔民充分运用了旧有的捕鱼工具（风网、帆船）。渔民组织起来了，开始改变了个体生产的方式。现代化的渔轮也在海面上活跃了起来。除烟台市渤海水产公司、山东省水产运销公司、山东水产公司的渔轮外，上海、辽东、旅大等水产公司的渔轮都驶来了。他们多半采用了“两个渔轮对腚围网”的捕鱼方法（把两个船并在一起行驶，网在船尾连结起来，发现鱼群就分头从两边去包围它们）。这个方法，过去日本人曾试验过，失败了。解放后，旅大水产公司的渔工和技术人员经多次试验，终于成功。从一九四九年到现在，逐步加以改进，已成为捕捉鲭鱼的最有效工作方法。有些帆船，也在仿行这个方法了。
    五月初头几天，天气不大好；但是，许多渔船都冒着风浪去捕鱼了。从五月一日到二十二日，就有六百万斤鱼上市。芝罘岛上东口村渔民李大喜的一个小组，就捕了六万斤鱼。旅大六号、七号渔轮，从十五日起，出海八次，就完成了五月份生产任务的百分之一百九十三。二十九日这天，许多渔轮都是一网就围进五六万条鱼，把鱼舱装满了，甲板上也堆满了鱼。山东水产公司的“渔甘”号，一天捕鱼十四万斤。
                                    ×  ×  ×
    渔场离烟台市区有三、四十海里（一百多里）。在广阔的海面上，布满了各式渔船。“对腚围网”的两只渔船，先后驶到了目的地，先把两个船用绳缆系住，把堆在船尾上的渔网连结起来，并肩前进。这时，两个“渔捞长”高踞在桅杆顶上的了望台上找寻鱼群，手里拿着红旗指挥。看！深蓝色的海水里，有一团团水波在蠕动，紫沉沉的，那就是大鱼群啊！红旗挥动了，“渔捞长”在喊叫：“靠左！”“靠右！”“快车！”“慢车！”“下网！快！”只有两三分钟，两个渔轮分开后又并拢，鱼群便被包围在中间了。全船的人都投入了战斗，向网口丢石子。“不让一个鱼逃掉！”“打啊！打啊！”哨子不停地吹着，钢丝车在绞动，十来个穿着橡皮裙靴的船员在船尾上拉网。海面上响起庄严而愉快的劳动歌声：“嘿哟！拉哟！一大群哟！使劲拉哟！”汗水和海水把他们身上弄得湿淋淋的，游动着的大鱼群把他们的心逗得喜洋洋的。两个舢板在海里整理“浮子”，像牧羊人一样把鱼群往两船之间的网池里赶。鱼群在奔跑，在窜动，水都不透明了，乌沉沉的全是鱼。船上的人们用口径约五六尺的“抄网”把鱼捞在舱里。一斤多重一条的鲭鱼，一抄要装三四百条，一网要抄到几十抄上百抄。鱼倒在舱里，发出劈劈拍拍的声音，闪着五彩的银光。
    一网，两网………，直到鱼装满舱，直到天黑。
                                    ×  ×  ×
    渔港里的海面是平静的，但是工作竞赛的高潮正在奔腾澎湃。码头上搬运工人在竞赛，加工厂里割鱼盐干工人在竞赛，帆船在竞赛，渔轮在竞赛。只要是好天气，差不多每天清晨都有生产胜利的消息从渔港委员会广播出来。旅大水产公司的十二对渔轮，到二十九日为止，已经有七对半挂上了胜利完成任务的红旗。各水产公司的生产任务，不只是完成了，多半是超额完成了。旅大第一五七号、一五八号渔轮，五月份任务是一九○吨，没到月底就已经达到了二百一十吨以上。船员们说：咱们还没有赶上六号、七号船；一定要追上去！
    雨天，鱼群很少；但是，如果水温适度，一有鱼就是大群。所以天气不太好的时候，渔轮也还是要出海的。风浪太大、找不到鱼的时候，为了节省油的消耗，就抛锚停在海里。
    这是船上最清闲的时候。船员们挤在舱里抓紧时间学文化。他们突击速成识字，互相做小先生；有时也聚在一堆谈谈天。他们大多是从帆船上转到渔轮上来的，从十三四岁就开始过海上生活，熬过晕船呕吐的痛苦，经常饿着肚子和风浪斗争，整天打不到一条鱼。他们仇恨日本帝国主义者对他们的迫害，把仇恨变成了现在的生产和斗争的力量。许多船员参加过地下革命斗争，有的船员参加过英雄的抗美援朝的支援前线工作。金光闪闪的抗美援朝纪念章，挂在旅大一五八号船长的舵楼上，挂在十四号大车的机舱里。革命乐观主义的气氛，洋溢在每个人胸怀；祖国建设的美丽远景，强有力地吸引着他们。一个年青的渔工说：“我们不久就要到大洋里去用炮打鲸鱼了。咱再有两个五年计划，渔船上就要大大变个样子了。”
    这话可是真的，今年，就已经和往年不同了。烟台大海市中除了渔船多、捕鱼多外，来实习和研究的人也更多了。东北水产试验场、上海水产学院、河北省水产专科学校、山东省烟台水产学校的许多技术员、教授、学生，都到这里的渔轮上、工场里参观、研究，跟工人们一块儿动手干活。这就是改进渔业技术和设备的一支重要的力量。
                                    ×  ×  ×
    在晴朗的早晨，海水平静如镜，是鱼群活跃在海面的好天气。大队大队的白帆，一对一对的渔轮，在海面上向东驶去。微风吹动，海水满面笑纹。海洋在笑，鱼儿在跳。太阳从东方升起，海面金光万点；我们在铺着黄金的道路上前进。
