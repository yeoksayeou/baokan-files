    Steadily Advancing the Teaching Reform of Higher Industrial Schools
    The recently held National Higher Industrial School Administrative Conference summarized the teaching reform work since the adjustment of departments. Over the past year, the vast majority of teachers have been actively learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, studying Marxism-Leninism, and carrying out teaching reforms, thereby improving their political and professional levels. As a result, their teaching ideology, teaching content, and teaching methods have all improved significantly, and the teaching effectiveness has also improved accordingly. These have become a solid foundation for further teaching reform. If, at the beginning of the teaching reform, a considerable number of teachers did not recognize the advanced nature of the Soviet experience and the great significance of the teaching reform, then after a year of practice, this situation has undergone a decisive change. Now, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to carry out teaching reform has not only become a common understanding for everyone, but also a unified action. The reason why the teaching reform of higher industrial schools has achieved great success lies here. However, from the perspective of leading the overall teaching reform, the question of how to correctly learn and apply the Soviet experience based on China's actual conditions and steadily carry out teaching reform has not yet been resolved. This is concentratedly manifested in the fact that the phenomenon of excessively high and hasty demands is still a problem urgently to be solved in the teaching reform of higher industrial schools.
    The current standards of Soviet higher education, which have developed for thirty-six years, were originally our long-term goal; however, the leading departments of our higher industrial education, due to lack of experience and necessary investigation and research, have regarded it as a goal to be achieved today, neglecting the specific conditions of our country's teachers, equipment, students, and the uneven development of work in various regions and schools. This unrealistic and excessively high demand has created the adverse consequences of generally heavy teaching tasks and excessive tension and busyness for teachers and students, so that the due teaching effect cannot be obtained.
    Why does the phenomenon of excessively high and hasty demands still exist after a year of teaching reform?
    This is primarily because some comrades, although verbally acknowledging the long-term and complex nature of teaching reform, actually attempt to complete it in a relatively short period, that is, to complete the fundamental transformation of higher industrial education and reach the current standards of the Soviet Union. This is of course impossible. Because the ultimate goal of teaching reform in our country's higher industrial schools is to thoroughly transform the old higher industrial education, which is of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial nature, deeply poisoned by the reactionary thoughts of the European and American bourgeoisie, and completely unable to meet the needs of the construction of New China, into a new type of higher industrial education that is of a new-democratic nature, led by the ideology of the working class, and completely suitable for the construction needs of a country that is gradually transitioning to a socialist society. Only when higher education fully meets the needs of national construction can the task of teaching reform be considered complete. From this point of view, teaching reform is truly a long-term and complex task that cannot be accomplished in a short period. In this regard, it is necessary to understand the situation in the Soviet Union. In the second year after the October Socialist Revolution, that is, in 1918, the Soviet Union began to reform the old capitalist higher education. Around the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan in 1928, the Soviet higher education system underwent fundamental reform, adjusted the leadership relationship of higher education institutions, and carried out the adjustment of departments. Since then, a series of works have been carried out in the areas of establishing new types of higher education institutions, ensuring that workers and children of workers can enter higher education institutions, and improving the quality of teaching in higher education institutions. Thus, in 1938, Molotov affirmed at the first All-Union Conference of Higher Education Workers that the Soviet higher education had undergone a fundamental transformation and that it was suitable for the needs of a country that was building socialism. From this, it can be known that the Soviet higher education took about twenty years from 1918 to 1938 to complete the fundamental reform, even if calculated from the reform of the education system in 1928, it took ten years. Some of our current conditions are indeed much better than those of the Soviet Union at that time. We have the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to learn from and the sincere help of the Soviet Union. We can greatly shorten the reform process of higher education, which is undoubtedly; however, our original higher education was very backward. It has only been four years since the national liberation, and the teaching reform has only been carried out for one year. It is impossible to complete the fundamental transformation of higher education and reach the current standards of the Soviet Union in a short period.
    Because we have not made appropriate estimates of our favorable conditions and actual difficulties, and have not truly understood the long-term and complex nature of teaching reform, we cannot correctly handle the relationship between needs and possibilities. Our national construction cause does require a large number of diverse construction talents with high political and scientific and technological levels, this is one aspect; on the other hand, our higher industrial education has emerged from the old higher education. Although a series of reforms have been carried out since liberation, this can only be said to be a preliminary reform, and it is still far from the completion of the fundamental reform task, so it cannot fully meet the needs of national construction at present. That is to say, there is still a large contradiction between the current situation of higher education institutions and the needs of national construction cadres. We are working hard every day to overcome this contradiction, but it will take a considerable amount of time to eliminate this contradiction. This situation is neglected by some comrades, so when they deal with problems, they cannot make a unified and realistic consideration of the two aspects of needs and possibilities, and put forward practical and feasible methods. They often emphasize the need for more and consider the possibility of less, and put forward some requirements that are currently impossible to achieve, creating passivity and difficulties in their work. This is the second reason for the excessively high and hasty demands in teaching reform.
    It should be said that the fundamental method of teaching reform, that is, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union must be combined with China's actual conditions, has not been fully applied in practical work. This is because some comrades have neither seriously studied the Soviet experience nor conducted practical investigation and research on China's actual conditions, that is, the needs of national construction cadres and the real situation of higher industrial schools. This is also an important reason why they demand too much and too hastily. To learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we must clearly understand the content of the Soviet experience. The Soviet experience we are talking about includes all aspects of the current system, educational content, teaching methods, and teaching organization of Soviet higher education, which are what we should learn. In order to truly absorb these experiences, we should know that these experiences are produced under certain conditions, and should be correctly applied according to China's actual conditions. It is well known that Soviet higher education has transformed from the old capitalist higher education, and it has its own development law in the entire transformation process. We must systematically understand the basic development law of Soviet higher education and systematically understand China's actual conditions before it is possible to correctly apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union based on China's specific conditions. If we do not understand what major development stages Soviet higher education has gone through, what problems were raised in each stage, what problems were solved, and what new problems were generated, and how it completed its fundamental reform, met the needs of socialist construction, and then met the needs of the country's construction from socialism to communism, then it is impossible to imagine that we will truly understand the Soviet experience, let alone correctly apply the Soviet experience.
    The phenomenon of excessively high and hasty demands in the teaching reform of higher industrial schools has been concluded by the National Higher Industrial School Administrative Conference. However, this does not mean that everyone's ideas are completely consistent. In fact, some comrades do not admit the existence of this phenomenon, some comrades admit it verbally but do not admit it in practice. Therefore, when considering the development direction and scale of the school, they are always too high and too large; when discussing the contraction of majors that are not yet very necessary and temporarily have no conditions to run well, they often hesitate and are reluctant to part with the obviously too large situation; more importantly, some comrades are unwilling to set appropriate requirements standards based on the current subjective and objective conditions. All of this is a concrete manifestation of the thought of being too high and too large. Although these comrades can list the excellent achievements of certain teachers and certain students to support their erroneous views, such teachers and students are still a minority nationwide or within a school after all, and we need to consider issues from the general situation of the country and the school. Therefore, to overcome the phenomenon of excessively high and hasty demands, we must first overcome the thought of being ambitious and greedy.
    To absorb the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we must first study the basic laws of development of Soviet higher education. The leading departments of higher industrial education can consider organizing the necessary personnel to conduct such studies. In the process of learning, we should also study the development law of higher education in our country since liberation, and recognize the specific conditions of our country's higher industrial education in terms of scientific and technological level, teachers, students, equipment, basic construction, and experience in running new types of industrial universities, so that we can consider how to better apply the Soviet experience and gradually improve the quality of teaching based on these conditions. Here, we must oppose the long-standing idea of blind advancement, and do not only care about the need and ignore the possibility, and put forward excessively high and hasty demands; at the same time, we must also prevent conservative thinking, and do not only care about the possibility and ignore the need, and even underestimate our conditions. The current conditions, coupled with subjective efforts, this is the starting point for our consideration of issues. The so-called subjective effort is to carry forward our advantages, correct our shortcomings, tap our potential, create conditions, and improve our work. Only in this way can we properly handle the relationship between needs and possibilities.
    Under the guidance of correct thought, it is possible to correctly handle specific problems. The most important thing now is to formulate requirements standards that are in line with China's actual conditions, especially the training objectives. The National Higher Industrial School Administrative Conference determined that the general training objective of the undergraduate program, in principle, is to train engineers who are adapted to China's actual conditions and scientific and technological level (which is the title of the graduate, not the position), so that students have the basic conditions to be an engineer. It also pointed out that under the current conditions, it is necessary to go through a certain period of effort to truly achieve such a training objective. As for the general training objective of the specialized course, each school is required to refer to the resolution of the Harbin Institute of Technology specialized course conference to make appropriate provisions. The question here is: What is an engineer who is suitable for China's actual conditions and scientific and technological level? It is necessary to understand that our country is a country that is gradually transitioning to socialism; the engineer who is adapted to China's actual conditions and scientific and technological level is completely consistent with the Soviet standards in its basic direction. That is to say, the engineers we train should have a high degree of political awareness and be able to master the most advanced scientific and technological knowledge. Such engineers are essentially different from bourgeois engineers. At present, due to the limitations of various conditions, we cannot reach the Soviet standards so quickly, but we can gradually reach this standard. The specific training objectives of each major that we currently require cannot be forced to be uniform due to the uneven development of each school, and there can only be a generally unified standard. This standard will be specifically studied by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government and relevant business departments, and the training objectives of certain majors will be determined first. When revising the teaching plan, each school should also invite representatives from relevant business departments and relevant factories and mines to participate, and put forward different specific requirements according to the different conditions of each school, in order to further clarify the training objectives.
    Some people ask: Isn't this in contradiction with the policy of "rectification and consolidation, key development, improving quality, and steady advancement"? Isn't this reducing quality? No, it is not. The improvement of quality we are talking about can only start from the current conditions and the existing foundation, rather than unrealistically improving to such a high standard as the Soviet Union all at once. The Soviet standard is the most advanced and highest standard of modern times, and the original foundation of higher industrial education in our country is extremely backward. Compared with the Soviet Union, the current conditions are still very far behind. This level should be soberly estimated. We want to steadily improve to the Soviet standard under the existing conditions. Needless to say, this is a gradual improvement process. Overcoming the current unrealistic, overly high, and hasty requirements is precisely for the purpose of steadily and practically improving the teaching effect, and it is by no means a reduction in quality. Therefore, to consider the issue of improving or reducing quality, we should always start from our current conditions and the existing foundation. If we leave this point and consider the issue based on subjective imagination, it can only cause ideological confusion and damage our cause of cultivating talents.
    The National Higher Industrial School Administrative Conference has made clear and definite conclusions on many fundamental issues. Higher industrial schools across the country should implement the resolutions of this conference, implement the policy of "rectification and consolidation, key development, improving quality, and steady advancement," learn and apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union according to the general line and general tasks of the current transition period and according to the current actual situation, overcome impetuous emotions, steadily continue to carry out teaching reform, and continuously improve their work in order to adapt to the needs of national construction to the greatest extent.

    稳步地推进高等工业学校的教学改革
    最近举行的全国高等工业学校行政会议，总结了院系调整以来的教学改革工作。一年来，绝大多数教师都在积极学习苏联先进经验、学习马克思列宁主义、进行教学改革的过程中，提高了政治和业务水平，因而教学思想、教学内容、教学方法都有了不少改进，教学效果也有了相应的提高，这些就成为进一步进行教学改革的坚实基础。如果说，在教学改革之初，还有相当数量的教师不认识苏联经验的先进性，不认识教学改革的重大意义的话，那末，经过一年来的实践，这种情况已经有了决定性的变化。现在，学习苏联先进经验进行教学改革，不仅成了大家的共同认识，而且成了大家的一致行动。高等工业学校的教学改革之所以获得了很大成绩，其原因就在这里。但是从整个教学改革的领导来看，究竟怎样根据中国的实际情况，正确地学习和运用苏联经验，稳步地进行教学改革，还是没有解决的问题。这集中地表现在：要求过高过急的现象，至今仍然是高等工业学校教学改革中迫待解决的问题。
    有着三十六年发展过程的苏联高等学校的现行标准，原是我们长期的努力方向；可是我们高等工业教育的领导部门，由于缺乏经验，缺乏必要的调查研究，却把它当作了我们今天就要达到的目标，忽视了我国师资、设备、学生以及各地区各学校工作发展不平衡等等的具体条件。这种脱离实际的过高要求，造成了教学任务一般过重，教师和学生过分紧张忙迫的不良后果，以致不能得到应有的教学效果。
    为什么在教学改革进行了一年以后，仍然存在着要求过高过急的现象呢？
    这首先是因为一部分同志虽然在口头上承认教学改革的长期性和复杂性，实际上却企图在比较短的时期内完成它，即完成高等工业教育的根本改造，达到苏联现行的标准。这当然是不可能的。因为我国高等工业学校教学改革的最终目的，是要使半封建半殖民地性质的、深受欧美资产阶级反动思想毒害的、完全不能适应新中国建设需要的旧的高等工业教育，彻底转变为新民主主义性质的、由工人阶级思想领导的、完全适合正在逐步过渡到社会主义社会的国家的建设需要的新型高等工业教育。只有在高等教育完全适应国家建设需要时，教学改革的任务才算完成。由此看来，教学改革真正是长期的复杂的工作，决不是短时期所能奏效的。在这一方面，了解一下苏联的情况是必要的。从十月社会主义革命以后的第二年，即一九一八年，苏联就着手改革旧的资本主义的高等教育。一九二八年，第一个五年计划开始前后，苏联高等教育制度进行了根本改革，调整了高等学校的领导关系，并进行了院系调整。此后又在建立新型的高等学校、保证工人和工人子女升入高等学校、提高高等学校教学质量等等方面进行了一系列的工作。这样，到一九三八年，莫洛托夫才在全苏第一次高等学校工作人员会议上肯定地指出，苏联的高等教育已经进行了根本改造，它已经适合正在建设社会主义的国家的需要。从这里可以知道，苏联的高等教育从一九一八年到一九三八年，大约有二十年的时间才完成了根本改革，即令从一九二八年改革教育制度算起，也有十年的时间。我们现在的某些条件确实比当时的苏联要好得多，我们有苏联的先进经验可资借鉴，有苏联的真诚帮助，我们可以大大地缩短高等教育的改革过程，这是毫无疑问的；但是我国原有的高等教育是十分落后的，全国解放才有四年，教学改革也只进行了一年，要想在短时期内完成高等教育的根本改造，达到苏联的现行标准，那是不可能的。
    由于对我们的有利条件和实际困难没有作恰当的估计，没有真正了解教学改革的长期性和复杂性，所以也就不能正确地处理需要和可能的关系问题。我们的国家建设事业，确实需要大量的、种类繁多的、政治和科学技术水平很高的建设人材，这是一方面；另一方面，我国的高等工业教育是从旧的高等教育脱胎出来的，解放以后虽然进行了一系列的改革，但这只能说是初步的改革，距离根本改革任务的完成还很远，所以目前还不能完全适应国家建设的需要。这就是说，高等学校的现状和国家建设的干部需要之间，还存在着很大的矛盾。我们天天都在努力克服这种矛盾，但是要消灭这种矛盾，还需要相当长的时间。这种情况被一部分同志所忽视，所以他们在处理问题的时候，就不能把需要和可能这两个方面作统一的实事求是的考虑，提出切实可行的办法，常常强调需要多，考虑可能少，提出了一些在目前不可能达到的要求，造成了工作中的被动和困难。这就是教学改革中要求过高过急的第二个原因。
    应该说，学习苏联先进经验必须和中国实际情况相结合这一教学改革的根本方法，还没有在实际工作中被充分运用。这是因为一部分同志既没有认真地研究苏联经验，也没有切实地调查和研究中国的实际情况，即国家建设的干部需要和高等工业学校的真实状况。他们所以要求过高过急，这也是一个重要原因。要学习苏联的先进经验，就须要把苏联经验的内容弄得清清楚楚。我们所说的苏联经验，包括了苏联高等教育的现行制度、教育内容、教学方法、教学组织等各个方面，这些是我们应该学习的。为要真正吸取这些经验，就应该知道，这些经验是在一定条件下产生的，应该根据我国实际情况正确地加以运用。尽人皆知，苏联的高等教育是从旧的资本主义的高等教育转变而来的，在整个转变过程中，它有着自己的发展规律。我们必须系统地了解苏联高等教育的基本发展规律，并系统地了解中国的实际情况，才有可能依据中国的具体条件正确地运用苏联的先进经验。如果不了解苏联高等教育究竟经历了什么样的主要发展阶段，每一阶段提出了什么问题，解决了什么问题，又产生了什么新的问题，怎样才完成了它的根本改革，适合了社会主义建设的需要，并进而适合了从社会主义过渡到共产主义的国家的建设需要，那就不能设想会真正了解苏联经验，更说不上正确地运用苏联经验了。
    高等工业学校教学改革中的要求过高过急现象，已经由全国高等工业学校行政会议作出结论。但是，这并不是说，大家的想法已经完全一致。事实上，有些同志还不承认这种现象的存在，有些同志口头上承认而实际上不承认，所以在考虑学校发展方向和规模的时候，总是偏高偏大；在讨论收拢尚非十分需要而且暂时没有条件办好的专业时，常常犹豫不决，留恋那显然是太大的摊子；更重要的是，有些同志不愿根据当前的主客观条件，规定适当的要求标准。这一切都是偏高偏大思想的具体表现。这些同志尽管可以列举某些教师和某些学生的优良成绩来支持自己的错误观点，但是这样的教师和学生在全国范围内或者在一个学校内目前毕竟还是少数，而我们却需要从全国、全校的普遍情况出发考虑问题。所以要克服要求过高过急的现象，首先就应该克服好大贪多的思想。
    要吸收苏联的先进经验，首先要研究苏联高等教育发展的基本规律。高等工业教育的领导部门，可以考虑组织必要的人员，进行这样的学习。在学习过程中，应该同时研究一下解放以来我国高等教育的发展规律，认识目前我国高等工业教育的科学技术水平、师资、学生、设备、基本建设以及办理新型工业大学的经验等等具体条件，以便根据这些条件，考虑如何更好地运用苏联的经验，逐步地提高教学质量。在这里须要反对存在已久的盲目冒进思想，不要只顾需要，不顾可能，提出过高过急的要求；同时也要防止保守思想，不要只顾可能，不顾需要，甚至过低估计我们的条件。目前的条件，加上主观努力，这才是我们考虑问题的出发点。所谓主观努力，就是要我们发扬优点，纠正缺点，发挥潜力，创造条件，提高工作。只有这样，才能够恰当地处理需要和可能的关系问题。
    在正确的思想的指导下，就有可能正确地处理具体问题。现在最重要的就是规定切合中国实际情况的要求标准，特别是培养目标。全国高等工业学校行政会议确定：本科的一般培养目标，原则上是培养适应中国实际情况和科学技术水平的工程师（是毕业生的称号而不是职位），使学生具备作一个工程师的基本条件。并且指出，在目前条件下，要真正达到这样的培养目标，还须经过一定时期的努力。至于专修科的一般培养目标，则要求各校参照哈尔滨工业大学专修科会议的决议适当规定。这里的问题是：什么是适合中国实际情况和科学技术水平的工程师呢？要了解我国是要逐步过渡到社会主义的国家；适应中国实际情况和科学技术水平的工程师，就其基本方向来说，是和苏联的标准完全一致的。这就是说，我们培养出来的工程师，应该具有高度的政治觉悟，并能掌握现代最先进的科学技术知识。这样的工程师，和资产阶级的工程师是有本质区别的。在目前，由于各种条件的限制，我们还不可能很快达到苏联那样高的标准，但是我们可以逐步地达到这个标准。我们目前所要求的各专业的具体培养目标，因为各校发展的不平衡性，还不能强求一律，只能有一个大体上统一的标准。这个标准，将由中央人民政府高等教育部和有关业务部门具体研究，把某些专业的培养目标首先确定下来。而各校在修订教学计划时，也应该邀请有关业务部门和有关厂矿的代表参加，根据各校的不同的条件，提出不同的具体要求，以进一步把培养目标明确起来。
    有人问：这不是和“整顿巩固，重点发展，提高质量，稳步前进”这一方针的“提高质量”矛盾么？这不是降低质量么？不，不是的。我们所说的提高质量，只能从目前条件和现有基础出发，而不是脱离实际地一下子要提高到苏联那样高的标准。苏联的标准是现代最先进的、最高的标准，而我国高等工业教育的原有基础是极其落后的，和苏联的比较，目前的条件也还差得很远很远，这一层，应该清醒地去估计。我们要在现有条件下稳步地提高到苏联的标准，不用说，这是逐步提高的过程。克服目前脱离实际的过高过急的要求，正是为着稳步切实地提高教学效果，而绝不是什么降低质量。所以，要考虑提高或降低质量的问题，总应该从我们目前的条件和现有基础出发，如果离开这一点，而根据主观的想像来考虑问题，那就只能造成思想上的混乱，有损于我们培养人材的事业。
    全国高等工业学校行政会议在许多根本问题上作出了明白确定的结论，全国高等工业学校应该执行这次会议的决议，贯彻“整顿巩固，重点发展，提高质量，稳步前进”的方针，根据当前过渡时期的总路线总任务，根据当前的实际情况，学习和运用苏联的先进经验，克服急躁情绪，稳步地继续进行教学改革，不断改进自己的工作，以期最大限度地适应国家建设的需要。
