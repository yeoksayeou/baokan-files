    Let the Motherland's Literary and Art Army Forever Sing for Heroes
    Chang Xiangyu
    During the four months of comfort performances on the Korean front, our Motherland's People's Delegation to Korea for Comforting Performances of Literary and Art Workers lived the most glorious and happiest days. Because the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers loved the Motherland, and the people of the Motherland loved the heroes, our emotions—those of the actors and the heroes—burned like a raging fire and flowed like a tidal wave. We shook hands, embraced, sang, cheered... using all kinds of forms to express our affectionate feelings. The respected heroes called us their relatives. They shouted: "Motherland! Relatives! We will answer you with new victories!"
    In the performances, I had never seen such an enthusiastic scene, seen so many heroic audiences, heard such sincere cheers, or received so many beautiful flowers and so many letters from heroes. I felt that this was the greatest glory in my more than twenty years of stage life, and also the most memorable thing in my life.
    The heroes cherished the Motherland's actors as they cherished the Motherland's wealth, caring for us in every way. When I walked into the "underground auditorium," the leaders and comrades took off their coats and warmly put them on me, and urged me: "Be careful not to catch a cold!" When I had a slight illness, the leaders and comrades came to see me twice and three times up and down the mountain, and wrote letters to comfort me. When we rested during the day, the soldiers temporarily added a post, greeting the comrades passing by: "The Motherland's relatives are tired, speak softly, walk slowly, don't wake them up." In our accommodation, whether in the mountains or in the trenches, the leaders and comrades always prepared everything needed completely, and also built pavilions with pine branches and made fences with mountain flowers, making our environment like a beautiful garden.
    The heroes not only cared for us in life, but also gave us a lot of help politically and ideologically. We met many outstanding combat heroes and listened to their reports of heroic deeds, which educated me, trained me, and improved me. The heroes grew up under the education and cultivation of the Communist Party of China, so I further realized the greatness of the Party. At this time, I expressed to the Party that I must work hard to improve my awareness, better serve the people, and strive to be a glorious Communist Party member.
    I saw Liu Guangzi, the lone hero who captured sixty-three enemies alive, and heard the report of the heroic deeds of Cai Jintong, the steel warrior who insisted on crawling back to his own position despite being seriously injured. I further realized the spirit of selfless struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers for the Motherland and for peace.
    The great deeds of the heroes educated me, which increased my infinite strength during the battlefield performances. Whenever I was tired from work or encountered difficulties, I thought of the heroes, and like the heroes, I thought of the glorious tasks given to us by the Motherland and Chairman Mao. So, when I was dizzy from the heat, I said to myself: "Persist!" When I was suffocated and vomiting, I gritted my teeth and swallowed the vomit, and persisted until a play was finished, and vomited it out when I returned to the backstage.
    Because I thought that the heroes could persevere in the fierce battle until victory, could I not persevere in performing even with illness?
    During the four months of comfort performances, I deeply realized the correctness of Chairman Mao's call for our literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the performances on the Korean front, we learned how to serve the soldiers on the battlefield. Our method is to change with the battlefield environment. We can perform in the large auditorium, and also in the tunnels; we can perform on the artillery position, and also beside the road, in the ward, and in the kitchen... No matter how many people there are, wherever there are Chinese People's Volunteers, we will go there to perform.
    We also encountered difficulties in our work. We learned the spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers in overcoming difficulties and overcame these difficulties. We made helmets from cigarette boxes (old drama props). The twelve or thirteen-year-old young actors carried all his stage costumes and shoe bags into the tunnels and went deep into the companies to perform. It was difficult for our small performance team of seventeen people to perform large dramas like Hua Mulan, but we performed it. Our band mastered five or six instruments per person, and one actor played five or six roles in a play, and even the person in charge of makeup also took on roles and went on stage to perform. When performing two shows, everyone did not take off their costumes, ate on the stage, and then continued to perform. We also learned and performed at the same time, and learned many programs from the troops. We regarded the Korean battlefield as a revolutionary university, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, everyone was our teacher.
    We saw the effect of our performances. At the end of many performances, the heroes all stood up to express their determination to the Motherland. They sent batches of letters of determination to us and asked us to take them to Chairman Mao. They wrote in the letters of determination: "We will use new victories to answer Chairman Mao and the Motherland's relatives' concern for us!" From these touching facts, I further realized that Chairman Mao's literary and art direction has opened up an infinitely broad road for the progress and development of actors.
    When we were about to say goodbye to the heroes, we were full of gratitude and nostalgia, and reluctant to leave our most beloved heroes of the Motherland.
    In the past four months, we have experienced war and also seen the armistice. We have performed for the victory of the anti-aggression war, and we have also sung for the victory of the glorious armistice. How much we love and respect the heroes who created these victories! When we are about to say goodbye to the heroes and return to the country, how reluctant we are to leave our most beloved people!
    We assure the heroes that we will definitely turn your education and rewards into our strength to serve the great Motherland, into the strength for the Motherland's literary and art warriors to move forward, and let the Motherland's literary and art army forever sing for the heroes!

### 让祖国的文艺大军永远为英雄歌唱

    让祖国的文艺大军永远为英雄歌唱
    常香玉
    在朝鲜前线四个来月的慰问演出中，我们祖国人民赴朝慰问文艺工作团过着最光荣和最欢乐的日子。由于中国人民志愿军英雄热爱着祖国，祖国人民热爱着英雄，使我们——演员和英雄的情感像烈火一般地燃烧着，像海潮一样地交流着。我们握手、拥抱、歌唱、欢呼……用各种各样的形式来表达我们亲热的情感。敬爱的英雄们把我们叫亲人。他们高呼着：“祖国啊！亲人啊！用新的胜利来回答你们！”
    在演出中，我从来没有见过那样热烈的场面，见过那样多的英雄观众，听到过那样真挚的欢呼，接受过那样多的美丽的花朵和那样多的英雄的来信。我感到这是我二十多年舞台生活中最大的光荣，也是我一生最值得纪念的一件事情。
    英雄们热爱祖国的演员像热爱祖国的财富一样，处处都关心我们。当我走向“地下礼堂”的时候，首长和同志们把自己的外衣脱下来，亲切地给我穿上，并且叮咛我：“小心别着凉！”当我有点小病的时候，首长和同志们便两次三番上山下山来看我，写信慰问我。当我们在白天休息的时候，战士们临时加上岗，招呼过往的同志们：“祖国的亲人疲劳了，轻点说话，慢点走，别把他们惊醒了。”在我们住宿的地方，不管在山上或在沟里，首长和同志们总是把一切应用的东西准备得齐齐全全，还用松枝搭成了凉亭，拿山花结成栏杆，使我们的环境变得像一个美丽的花园。
    英雄们不但在生活上关心我们，并且在政治上和思想上给了我们许多帮助。我们会见了许多出色的战斗英雄，听了他们的英雄事迹的报告，使我受到教育，受到锻炼，得到提高。英雄们是在中国共产党的教育培养下成长起来的，因而我更进一步体会到党的伟大。就在这个时候，我向党表示，我一定要努力提高觉悟，更好地为人民服务，争取作一个光荣的共产党员。
    我看到过活捉六十三个敌人的孤胆英雄刘光子，听到过身负重伤坚持爬回自己阵地的钢铁战士蔡金同的英雄事迹的报告，我进一步体会到中国人民志愿军为了祖国、为了和平那种忘我斗争的精神。
    英雄们的伟大事迹教育着我，使我在战地演出的时候增加了无穷的力量。每当工作疲劳或遇到困难的时候，我想起了英雄们，并和英雄一样地想起了祖国和毛主席给予我们的光荣任务。所以，在热得发晕的时候，我对自己说：“坚持下去！”在闷得呕吐的时候，我咬紧牙，把呕上来的再咽下去，坚持到一场戏演完，回到后台再吐出来。
    因为我想到英雄们能够在激烈的战斗中坚持到胜利，难道我就不能带病坚持演完戏吗？
    在四个来月的慰问演出中，我深深地体会到毛主席号召我们文艺为工农兵服务的方向的正确。在朝鲜前线的演出中，我们学到了在战场上为兵服务的方法。我们的方法是随战地环境变化而变化。我们在大礼堂里能演，在坑道里也能演；在炮阵地上能演，在公路旁边、病房里、厨房里也都能演……。不论人多人少，那里有中国人民志愿军战士，我们就到那里去演。
    我们在工作中也遇到过困难。我们学习中国人民志愿军克服困难的精神而克服了这些困难。我们用纸烟盒做了头盔（旧剧道具）。十二、三岁的小演员自己携带他用的全部戏衣和鞋包走进坑道，深入连队去演出。我们十七个人组成的一个小型演出队，演出像花木兰一类的大戏是有困难的，但我们演出了。我们的乐队一个人掌握五六种乐器，一个演员在一出戏里演五、六个角色，连管化装的人也担任角色，上场演戏。在演两场的时候，大家就不下装，在舞台上吃了饭再接着演。我们还边学边演，学会了部队里的许多节目。我们把朝鲜战地当作一所革命的大学，中国人民志愿军战士，人人都是我们的老师。
    我们看到了自己演出的效果。在许多次演出结束时，英雄们全体起立向祖国表达决心。他们把一批一批的决心书送到我们手里，让我们带给毛主席。他们在决心书上写着：“我们要用新的胜利来回答毛主席和祖国的亲人对我们的关怀！”从这些感人的事实中，使我更进一步体会到毛主席的文艺方向，给演员的进步和发展开辟了一条无限广阔的道路。
    在我们将要向英雄们告别的时候，我们满怀感激和留恋之情，舍不得离开我们最可爱的祖国的英雄。
    四个月来，我们经历了战争，同时也看到了停战。我们曾为反侵略战争的胜利而演出，又曾为光荣停战的胜利而歌唱。我们是多么热爱和尊敬创造这些胜利的英雄们啊！当我们即将向英雄们告别返国的时候，我们是多么舍不得离开我们的最可爱的人啊！
    我们向英雄们保证，一定把你们的教育和奖励变成我们为伟大祖国服务的力量，变成为祖国文艺战士前进的力量，让祖国的文艺大军永远为英雄们歌唱！    （新华社）
