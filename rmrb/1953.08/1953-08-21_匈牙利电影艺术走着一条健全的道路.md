Hungarian Film Art is Following a Healthy Path
Zhong Dianfei

Starting from August 20th, the "Hungarian People's Republic Film Week," simultaneously held in twenty major cities in our country, will feature the first screening of six excellent Hungarian films in our country. Our people will be educated by these films. Judging from the main characteristics exhibited by these films, they also offer great insights for our country's film art today.

The Party spirit principle of film art requires film artists to have insight into reality

The film art front is an ideological front. For film art work to be effective, it first requires the soldiers on this front to understand the position of art in the entire revolutionary struggle and national construction, to understand what kind of education is needed in people's minds, and to understand when and how to help the people. The six Hungarian films in this exhibition clearly demonstrate that Hungarian film artists clearly understand their tasks and are able to perceive the important developments and changes in real life. Therefore, they are able to call on people in a timely manner to engage in various political and ideological struggles.

The film "Underground Colony" exposes a slowdown incident at an American oil refinery that occurred in Hungary in 1948. The slowdown itself contained a huge political conspiracy. After the conspiracy was exposed, it aroused the anger of the entire Hungarian people and the people of the world. Hungarian film artists selected this theme with great political significance to help the people further recognize the evil face of American imperialism and how American capitalists and spies in Hungary used conspiracies such as abandoning oil wells and sabotaging oil drilling plans to deprive the Hungarian people of oil in order to strangle the construction cause of the Hungarian people.

Another film, "Two Worlds," powerfully criticizes an incorrect idea, namely, that science is unrelated to politics, by focusing on the incident of Professor Yagos being kidnapped to West Berlin by American "cultural" agents while traveling from Budapest to Berlin to attend a geological conference. When Professor Yagos personally experienced American "civilization" and "democracy," and when he saw that his old American friend, McLane, was not studying any science, but had completely degenerated into a murderer, he realized that although he was an expert in science, he was too naive in politics. He resolutely escaped from West Berlin. When his plane landed at the Budapest airport, he felt even more the loveliness of his motherland. He simply said to the friends who came to greet him, "I'm back!" But this meant that he had returned from another world. The profound significance of "Two Worlds" lies in the fact that it helps people to draw a clear ideological boundary between the two worlds through credible facts. Therefore, it is a film of great educational significance for both the Hungarian people and the people of the people's democratic countries.

Regarding the film "Baptism of Fire," we can also say the same thing: it is helping to solve the difficulties in Hungary's agricultural cooperation with great enthusiasm. This help lies in its unwavering spirit in adhering to the Party's line in the agricultural cooperation cause.

All of this gives us reason to say that Hungarian film art is unconditionally loyal to the Hungarian working class and the Hungarian people, consciously becomes a faithful assistant to the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Hungarian government, and consciously serves the interests of all the Hungarian people and the cause of peace for the people of the world. This has laid the foundation for the Party spirit principle of Hungarian film art.

The Party spirit principle of Hungarian film art is also manifested in another aspect, that is, it has a clear internationalist spirit. Among the six films in this exhibition, apart from "Mattie the Goose-boy," which is adapted from a famous Hungarian long poem of the past, the other five films with contemporary real life as their themes have three films—"Underground Colony," "Two Worlds," and "Katalin's Marriage"—that closely linked the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union in their artistic descriptions. As Imre Nagy, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, said in his report to the National Assembly on July 4th this year: "Liberation has opened up before us the prospect of building a progressive and socialist new country. However, if it were not for the comprehensive and vigorous assistance of the Soviet Union, we would not have been able to carry out the great work with our own strength and resources. In our great work of building socialism and in improving the material life of the working people, the Soviet Union has given us invaluable assistance in accordance with the principles of economic mutual assistance and cooperation." Therefore, as a realistic artist, one cannot treat this brotherly help as an embellishment in art, but rather as an important factor in the new life. For example, in the film "Underground Colony," Chief Engineer Bano's prospecting design work was finally corrected and succeeded precisely because of the help of his Soviet friend, geologist Gusev; Professor Yagos in "Two Worlds" was able to apply his coal seam prospecting device precisely because he obtained the Soviet coal seam prospecting tube; in "Katalin's Marriage," the arrival of the Soviet new-style spinning machines at the spinning mill aroused even more enthusiasm for production among the workers, making them see clearly who were friends and who were enemies.

Through these films, we see the spirit of patriotism and internationalism overflowing in the lives of the Hungarian people. The reason why Hungarian film artists can embody this spirit in their works is because they have deeply observed life and used great artistic ingenuity.

The breadth of film themes is the condition for film to maintain the broadest contact with the people

The Party spirit principle of film art should also be linked to the breadth of film themes. Because, if literary and artistic works are to be closely linked to the masses, they should not only pay attention to those political themes with great significance in people's lives, but also pay attention to the growth of new moral qualities in people's lives that have universal significance and are related to the vital interests of the people. The six films in this exhibition, from "Two Worlds" to "Katalin's Marriage," specifically demonstrate that Hungarian film artists are not only concerned about the understanding of the relationship between politics and science by scientists like Professor Yagos, but also concerned about the understanding of happiness by girls like Katalin, and the responsibilities that advanced workers like Jojika (Katalin's husband) should have towards their wives.

The Marxist-Leninist view of literature and art never regards social life as singular, and never believes that a person's political life and his daily life can be completely separated. In "Katalin's Marriage," what Jojika is dissatisfied with Katalin is that she is immersed in the warmth of the family and neglects public affairs. Therefore, they lose the warmth of the family instead. And when Katalin begins to understand that she should not only fulfill her responsibilities to her husband as a wife and to her mother as a daughter, but also fulfill her responsibilities to society as a citizen, their true love is rebuilt. And on Jojika's side, he also received such a lesson: "I didn't spend more time to help her well and let her become an advanced worker. Especially when she had already achieved good results at work and became an advanced worker, my attitude towards her was still very impatient."

From this, it can be seen that the breadth of film themes itself marks the depth of film artists' understanding of real life; the breadth of film themes allows the spiritual outlook of the people to be displayed in many ways.

Related to this is that the breadth of film themes also relies on film screenwriters being good at observing and expressing life from various angles. "Two Worlds" is a serious political theme, but it is expressed from the corner of the Institute of Geophysics. We once used "a storm in a teacup" to mock the narrow range of themes depicted by artists, but in scientists' test tubes, great storms often arise! (There are many Soviet films in this regard) Therefore, when we talk about seriously observing life, we should not only see those common things, but also be able to see those uncommon things, but things that belong to the essence of life. An artist should not be satisfied with a superficial observation of life. Because the life displayed by art should not only be the scenes of life, but more importantly, the meaning of life. The artist's responsibility lies in revealing the most essential meaning of life in those common and uncommon things.

Judging from the scope of film works, we should also point out that Hungarian film artists are not only enthusiastic about the themes of today's real life, but also appropriately pay attention to the themes of yesterday. "Mattie the Goose-boy," which is adapted from the famous long poem by the Hungarian modern poet Fazekas Mihály, fully illustrates that Hungarian film artists are also very attentive in treating their own nation's excellent literary heritage. The film "Mattie the Goose-boy" has won world acclaim for its full revolutionary spirit and beautiful legendary color. This is not only not in conflict with films with current real life as their themes, but also complements each other.

Therefore, it can be said that the breadth of film themes and the diversity of film forms are important conditions for film to attract audiences of various interests and levels around it.

Boldly revealing the contradictions in life is the basis for constructing the plot of a film

The reason why Hungarian films deeply attract us is also because they boldly reveal the contradictions in real life, and also because they attach great importance to the plot of film stories. Comrade Mao Zedong once taught us: "A large thing contains many contradictions in its development process." "A simple process has only one pair of contradictions, while a complex process has more than one pair of contradictions." ("On Contradiction") This is exactly what we feel when we watch "Baptism of Fire" and "Mattie the Goose-boy." The film "Baptism of Fire" depicts how to treat middle peasants in agricultural production cooperatives. The strength of this film lies in the fact that when it deals with the contradiction between individual farmers and agricultural production cooperatives, it reveals all aspects of its contradictions—the contradiction between the cooperative chairman Klem and the Party branch secretary Bojinie regarding the issue of the line; the contradiction between the middle peasant Hatto and the rich peasant Shao Haer and his brother-in-law (counter-revolutionary) Misha. These aspects are mutually exclusive and interconnected. Klem is loyal to the agricultural cooperation cause, but he believes that the poor and lower-middle peasants "shed blood in the revolutionary struggle," and the middle peasants are now joining the cooperative to "enjoy the fruits of their labor"; therefore, he advocates excluding the middle peasants from the cooperative; the participation of the middle peasant Hatto in the cooperative has a significant impact on other middle peasants, but he used to buy threshing machines and mills in partnership with the rich peasants, and he had a love relationship with Bojinie. The rich peasant Shao Haer is precisely using this point to split the relationship between Hatto and the cooperative, and to slander Bojinie, who has always adhered to the Party's line. The plot constructed on this basis in the film is convincing. But the film does not lose its direction in various contradictions, and it is because it grasps the basic contradiction between the working farmers and the rich peasants and counter-revolutionaries in the theme. After a serious class struggle, the cooperative was consolidated and developed, and the counter-revolutionaries who were in contact with the rich peasants were finally caught.

In the film "Mattie the Goose-boy," after Mattie received fifty strokes and declared to the landlord Debreczeni, "I, Mattie, will definitely come and beat you three times in the same way," the contradiction became sharper, deeper, and more complex each time. At first, it was a contradiction between Mattie and Debreczeni, which gradually expanded to the contradiction between Debreczeni and his servants, and later even expanded to the contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class. It is able to closely attract the audience, and it is because the contradictions it depicts are gradually deepened.

From this, it can be seen that one of the important tasks of film art creation lies in its ability to reveal the conflicts in life and in the characters, and to show the drama of the conflict through the artistic structure.

Depicting the character of positive characters in many ways is the most important responsibility of film art

Hungarian film artists did not depict the characters standing at the forefront of the struggle in the film as dry, unfeeling, and ignorant of the pleasures of life, but comprehensively—that is, according to the truth of life—to portray the characters of positive characters. In "Underground Colony," when Lergès, a cadre from a worker background (director of the production department of Makart Oil Company), is entrusted by the Party and the state to find ways to increase oil production, his attitude towards completing this huge task is very principled. On his first day on the job, he encountered the unreasonable dismissal of workers by the capitalists. He immediately went to see Papo, the general manager of Makart, and demanded that the decision to dismiss the workers be revoked immediately. When Papo said, "The company's interests require the dismissal of a group of workers," he said without hesitation: "You must know that I am a representative of the government. I am not allowed to do this."

And when changing the academic views of Chief Engineer Bano, he did not rely on his authority, but used the patriotism of the working class and the humble and cautious political demeanor to persuade the other party. He said to Bano: "Our motherland has thousands of vehicles that need oil, but we can't get it out. I want to know where the oil is, and I have to dig it out with ten fingers. Please come and help us." Chief Engineer Bano was finally moved by his sincere talk and agreed to look for a place where oil could be extracted. Kedas in "Two Worlds" is a character of the same type as Lergès. They are able to confide in their friends and treat each other sincerely, and have no mercy on their enemies. Their humility towards friends and their spirit of learning in the face of new things more deeply express the attitude of the Hungarian working class as masters.

In "Baptism of Fire," the character of Bojinie, the Party branch secretary of the cooperative, is also portrayed very successfully. The rich peasant Shao Haer suddenly slandered her in front of everyone, making her feel overwhelmed. However, when the middle peasant members who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative used large pieces of wood to break open the door of the stables, Bojinie immediately used her body to block the door. At this moment, she was shot by the counter-revolutionary Misha. She lay in bed and asked her daughter to draw the curtains open for her, and she wanted to see the sun. Because what she was thinking about at this time was that the sowing season had arrived, but the cooperative was in a troubled time. So she convened a meeting of the Party branch committee while lying in bed and seriously solved the problem of the cooperative uniting the middle peasants to join the cooperative. The spiritual qualities of a new and inspiring character are perfectly reflected in Bojinie.

The comprehensive portrayal of the character of positive characters is of great significance in film art creation, because film bears the most direct educational task for the people. What does the film use to educate the people? Characters. Especially new, real, and credible characters. These characters are familiar to us—because they live among us, and they are also temporarily unfamiliar to us—because new moral qualities are growing in them. Therefore, they are both ordinary people and not ordinary people; both common characters and uncommon characters. It is these characters that can be understood and approached by the people, and who can guide the people towards the great goal—a communist society.

From the above characteristics, we can say without exaggeration that Hungarian film art is following a healthy path. Naturally, the attainment of these achievements is inseparable from the care and help of the Hungarian Working People's Party for film art, inseparable from the efforts of Hungarian film artists, and also inseparable from their enthusiastic and unreserved learning of Soviet film art.

We hope to see more and greater achievements in the Hungarian film art cause in the future.

    匈牙利电影艺术走着一条健全的道路
    钟惦棐
    从八月二十日开始在我国二十个大城市同时举行的“匈牙利人民共和国电影周”，将有六部优秀的匈牙利影片在我国首次放映。我国人民将从这些影片中受到教育；从这几部影片所表现出的几点主要特征看来，对于我国今天的电影艺术，也有着很大的启示。
    电影艺术的党性原则要求电影艺术家洞察现实
    电影艺术战线是一条思想战线。电影艺术工作要获得成效，首先就要求在这一条战线上的战士们明白艺术在整个革命斗争、国家建设中所处的地位，明白在人们的思想上需要些什么教育，明白应该在什么时候，用什么方法去帮助人民。这次展览的六部匈牙利影片，它显然可以表明一件事情，这就是匈牙利电影艺术家们清楚地了解自己的任务，并能洞察现实生活中的重要发展和变化。因而他们能够适时地号召人们去从事政治上的和思想上的各种斗争。
    影片“地下殖民地”，揭露了一九四八年在匈牙利发生的一件美国大炼油厂的怠工事件。怠工的本身包含着巨大的政治阴谋。当阴谋被揭露之后，曾引起全匈牙利人民和全世界人民的愤怒。匈牙利电影艺术家们选取了这一有着巨大的政治意义的主题，帮助人民进一步认识了美帝国主义的罪恶面目，认识了那些在匈牙利的美国资本家和间谍分子，如何用荒废油井，破坏钻油计划等阴谋来使匈牙利人民得不到石油，以扼杀匈牙利人民的建设事业。
    另一部影片“两个世界”借主角亚高斯教授从布达佩斯到柏林开地质学会议，不幸为美国的“文化”特务绑架到西柏林去的事件，有力地批评了一种不正确的思想，即：科学是与政治无关的。当亚高斯教授亲身尝试了美国的“文明”和“民主”，当他看见他的美国老朋友麦克兰，并不是在研究什么科学，而已经彻头彻尾地堕落到一个杀人犯的地步，他才感到自己虽在科学上是老手，但在政治上，却太幼稚。他毅然地逃出了西柏林。当他的飞机在布达佩斯飞机场着陆的时候，他更感到了祖国的可爱。他简单地对来迎接他的朋友们说：“回来了！”但这却意味着，这是从另一个世界回来了。“两个世界”的深刻意义，是在于它通过可信的事实，帮助人们划清了两个世界的思想界限。因之，它无论对匈牙利人民和对人民民主国家的人民，都是一部具有巨大教育意义的影片。
    关于影片“战斗的洗礼”，我们也可以同样地说，它是怀着很大的热情，去帮助解决匈牙利农业合作事业中的困难的。这种帮助是在于它对农业合作事业中应该坚持党的路线，表现了决不调和的精神。
    所有这些，都使我们有理由这样说：匈牙利电影艺术无条件地忠实于匈牙利的工人阶级和匈牙利人民，自觉地成为匈牙利劳动人民党和匈牙利政府的忠实助手，自觉地为匈牙利全体人民的利益和全世界人民的和平事业而服务，这便奠定了匈牙利电影艺术的党性原则。
    匈牙利电影艺术的党性原则，还表现在另外一个方面，就是它具有鲜明的国际主义精神。在这次展览的六部影片中，除了以匈牙利过去的著名长诗改编的“牧鹅少年马季”外，其它五部以今天的现实生活为题材的影片中，便有三部——“地下殖民地”、“两个世界”、“卡塔琳的婚姻”是在艺术描写中紧密地联系到苏联的友好帮助的。正如匈牙利人民共和国部长会议主席伊姆雷·纳吉今年七月四日在国民议会上的报告中说的：“解放在我们面前展开了建设一个进步的和社会主义新国家的前途。但是，如果不是得到苏联全面的大力帮助，我们就不可能靠自己的力量和资源来进行巨大的工作，在我们建设社会主义的伟大工作上，在改进劳动人民的物质生活上，苏联都依照经济上互助合作的原则，给我们难以估价的帮助。”因之，作为一个现实主义的艺术家，就不能把这种兄弟般的帮助，在艺术上，当做点缀来描写，而是作为新生活中的一个重要因素来描写。比如，在影片“地下殖民地”中，巴诺总工程师的探矿设计工作，正是由于得到他的苏联朋友——地质学家古塞夫的帮助而最后地修正了错误，得到成功的；“两个世界”中的亚高斯教授，正由于得到了苏联的煤层试探管，才使他所设计的探煤器，能够应用；在“卡塔琳的婚姻”中，苏联的新式纺纱机运到纺纱厂，更深刻地掀起了工人们更高的生产热情，使他们看清了谁是朋友，谁是敌人。
    通过这些影片，我们看见洋溢在匈牙利人民生活中的爱国主义和国际主义精神。匈牙利电影艺术家所以能在作品中体现这种精神，是因为他们深入地观察了生活，而且用了巨大的艺术匠心。
    电影题材的广泛性是电影和人民保持最广泛联系的条件
    电影艺术的党性原则，还应该和电影题材的广泛性联系起来。因为，文艺作品要紧密地联系群众，这就不仅要注视人民生活中那些有着巨大意义的政治主题，而且还要留心人民生活中那些带有普遍意义的，关系到人民切身利益的新道德品质的成长。此次展览的六部影片，从“两个世界”到“卡塔琳的婚姻”，都具体地表明了匈牙利电影艺术家们，不仅关切到像亚高斯教授这样的科学家，对于政治和科学的关系的理解问题，而且也关切到像卡塔琳这样的姑娘对于幸福的理解，关切到像尧日卡
    （卡塔琳的丈夫）这样的先进工人对于自己的妻子应尽的责任问题。
    马克思列宁主义的文艺观，从来不把社会生活看做是单一的，从来不认为人的政治生活和他的日常生活是可以截然分开的。在“卡塔琳的婚姻”中，尧日卡所不满意卡塔琳的，是她沉缅于家庭的温暖，而忽视了公众的事情。因此，他们反而失去了家庭的温暖。而当卡塔琳开始明白了，她不仅应该对丈夫尽妻子的责任，对母亲尽女儿的责任，而且还应该对社会尽公民的责任的时候，他们之间真正的爱情，才重新建立起来。而在尧日卡方面，也同时得到了这样的教训：“我没有分出更多的时间来很好地帮助她，让她成为先进工人。尤其是当她在工作上已经得到了很好的成绩，成了一个先进工人，而我对她的态度还是很急躁。”
    由此可知，电影题材的广泛性，它本身便标志着电影艺术家对现实生活的深入程度；电影题材的广泛性，就使得人民的精神面貌，能够多方面地显示出来。
    与此有关的是：电影题材的广泛性，还依靠电影剧作家善于从各式各样的角度去观察生活，表现生活。“两个世界”是一个严重的政治主题，但它却是从地球物理研究所的一角去表现的。我们曾用 “茶杯里的风波”去嘲笑艺术家所描写的题材范围的狭小，但是在科学家的试验管里，却常常掀起了很大的风波！（苏联影片在这方面的选材是不少的）因之，在我们谈到要认真地去观察生活的时候，就不只是要看见那些常见的事物，而且，也要能够看见那些不常见的，但是属于生活中最本质的事物。一个艺术家不应该满足于对生活的表面的观察。因为，艺术所显示的生活，不应该只是生活的场景，而更重要的是生活的意义。艺术家的职责，就在于要在那些常见的和不常见的事物中，显示出生活中最本质的意义。
    从电影作品的取材范围看，我们还应该指出的是：匈牙利电影艺术家不仅热心于今天的现实生活的题材，而且也适当地注意了昨天的题材。根据匈牙利近代诗人法日卡士·米哈依的著名长诗改编的“牧鹅少年马季”，便充分地说明了匈牙利电影艺术家在对待自己民族优秀的文学遗产方面，也是非常注意的。电影“牧鹅少年马季”以它充沛的革命精神和优美的传奇色彩，曾经博得了世界的声誉。这个，不仅不和以当前的现实生活为题材的影片相冲突，而且还是互相辉映的。
    因之可以这样说，电影题材的广泛性和电影形式的多样性，是电影能够把各种不同爱好、不同程度的观众吸引在它周围的重要条件。
    勇敢地揭示生活中的矛盾是构成电影故事情节的基础
    匈牙利电影之所以深深地吸引住我们，还在于它是勇敢地揭示了现实生活中的矛盾，还在于它十分重视电影故事的情节。毛泽东同志曾经教导我们说：“一个大的事物，在其发展过程中，包含着许多的矛盾。”“单纯的过程只有一对矛盾，复杂的过程则有一对以上的矛盾。”（“矛盾论”）当我们看“战斗的洗礼”、“牧鹅少年马季”时所感到的，就正是这样。影片“战斗的洗礼”所描写的，是在农业生产合作社中如何对待中农的问题。这个影片的长处就在于当它处理个体农民和农业生产合作社之间的矛盾的时候，揭示了它的矛盾的各个方面——合作社主席克列姆和党支部书记波吉涅之间关于路线问题的矛盾；中农哈托与富农邵哈尔以及他的妻弟（反革命分子）米沙之间的矛盾。这些方面相互排斥着又相互联系着。克列姆忠于农业合作事业，但他以为：贫雇农们“在革命斗争中流过血”，中农现在参加合作社是“坐享其成”；所以他主张把中农从合作社排挤出去；中农哈托参加合作社对其它中农有重大影响，但他过去与富农伙买过打谷机和磨坊，并与波吉涅有过恋爱关系。富农邵哈尔正是利用这点分裂哈托与合作社的关系，并借此中伤一贯坚持党的路线的波吉涅。影片在此基础上所构成的故事情节，是令人信服的。但影片在诸种矛盾中并未迷失方向，便在于它抓住了题材中的劳动农民和富农以及反革命分子之间的基本矛盾。经过了一场严重的阶级斗争后，合作社巩固和发展起来了，和富农有联系的反革命分子也终于落网。
    在影片“牧鹅少年马季”中，当马季挨了五十大棍，向地主杰勃列吉申言“我马季一定要照样来打你三次”之后，矛盾一次比一次来得尖锐、深刻、复杂。开始是马季和杰勃列吉之间的矛盾，渐次扩展到杰勃列吉和他底仆人间的矛盾，后来竟扩展成为农民阶级和地主阶级间的矛盾。它能够紧紧地吸引住观众，是它所描写的矛盾逐渐深化了。
    由此可见，电影艺术创作的重要任务之一，便在于它能够揭示生活中以及人物性格中的冲突，并通过艺术的结构，把冲突的戏剧性显示出来。
    多方面地刻划正面人物的性格是电影艺术最重要的职责
    匈牙利电影艺术家们不是把影片中站在斗争前列的人物，描写成为干瘪的、不懂人情世故、也不懂得生活情趣的人，而是全面地——也就是说，按照生活的真实去刻划正面人物的性格。在“地下殖民地”中，当工人出身的干部（马克尔特石油公司的生产部主任）黎尔格士受党和国家的委托必须设法增加石油产量时，他对于完成这一巨大任务所采取的态度，是很有原则性的。他到职的第一天，就碰见了资方无理开除工人的事。他立刻去找马克尔特总经理巴波，要求立即撤销开除工人的决定。当巴波说：“公司的利益要求解雇一批工人。”他毫不迟疑地说：“你要知道我是政府的代表我是不允许这样做的。”
    而在改变巴诺总工程师的学术观点时，他便不是凭借职权，而是以工人阶级的爱国主义精神和谦逊谨慎的政治风度去说服对方的。他对巴诺说：“我们祖国有千千万万个机器车辆需要石油，可是我们拿不出来，我要知道石油在哪儿，用十个指头也得把它挖出来。请你来帮助我们吧。”巴诺总工程师终于被他诚挚的谈话所感动，答应去寻找可以挖出石油的地方。 “两个世界”中的凯达斯，与黎尔格士是两个同类型的人物。他们能够对朋友推心置腹、赤诚相待，对敌人毫不留情。他们那种对朋友的谦逊和在新事物面前的学习精神，是更深刻地表现了匈牙利工人阶级的主人翁态度。
    在“战斗的洗礼”中，合作社党支部书记波吉涅的性格，亦是被描写得很成功的。富农邵哈尔突如其来地在众人面前中伤她，使她顿时感到吃不消。可是，当要退社的中农社员们用大木头去撞开马房的大门时，波吉涅立刻用身子去挡住大门。恰在这时，她被反革命分子米沙的枪打伤了。她躺在床上，叫女儿给她拉开窗帷，她要看看阳光。因为这时她所惦记的，是播种的季节已经到了，而合作社却正在多事之秋。她于是躺在床上召开了党的支部委员会，认真地解决了合作社应团结中农入社的问题。一种能够令人振奋的新人物的精神品质，在波吉涅的身上，很完满地体现出来了。
    全面地刻划正面人物的性格之所以在电影艺术创作上具有非常重大的意义，便由于电影担负着对人民最直接的教育任务。影片通过什么去教育人民呢？人物。尤其是新的真实可信的人物。这些人物是我们所熟悉的——因为他生活在我们当中，又是我们暂时还不熟悉的——因为在他的身上生长着新的道德品质。因之，它既是普通人，又不是普通人；既是常见的性格，又是不常见的性格。正是这些能为人民所理解、所亲近的人物，又是能够引导人民向着伟大的目标——共产主义社会前进。
    从以上这几个特征方面看来，我们可以毫不夸张地说，匈牙利的电影艺术，是在走着一条健全的道路。自然，这些成就的得来，是和匈牙利劳动人民党对电影艺术的关怀和帮助分不开的，是和匈牙利电影艺术家的努力分不开的，而且，也和他们热心地、放手地学习苏联电影艺术分不开的。
    我们希望今后能够看到匈牙利电影艺术事业更多、更大的成就。
