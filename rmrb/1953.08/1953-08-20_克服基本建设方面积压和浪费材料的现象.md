Economic Work Commentary

    According to the investigation by branches of the Bank of Communications in various locations, the backlog of materials and the waste and losses caused by the backlog are quite serious in many basic construction units. The material portion of state investment in basic construction generally accounts for around 60%. The large-scale backlog and waste of materials will inevitably lead to losses in the state's investment in basic construction and will affect the smooth progress of national basic construction.
    Given the current shortage of design capacity in our country, inaccurate planning, and the inability of national material management departments to fully achieve balance, some material backlog in basic construction units is unavoidable. However, it is unacceptable for many basic construction units to blindly purchase and allocate materials without considering actual needs, and then fail to properly manage and use them, resulting in material backlog, waste, and losses. For example, the state-owned Shaanxi No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory purchased 30.5 billion yuan worth of machinery and equipment before the basic construction design plan was finalized, resulting in a backlog. Some construction units purchase materials without a plan, often resulting in duplicate and excessive purchases. This year, Chongqing Electric Power Engineering Company purchased materials separately in Beijing and Chongqing. Due to a lack of coordination, the duplicated purchases of machinery amounted to 790 million yuan, and the excess purchases of equipment amounted to over 2.1 billion yuan. The blind allocation of materials by some competent departments also leads to the backlog of certain materials. The Northeast Qingchengzi Lead Mine received 1.29 billion yuan worth of explosives from its superiors, of which 800 million yuan worth of explosives was backlogged because it exceeded the need.
    There are many reasons for these phenomena. First, many cadres in the construction departments have a mentality of greed and recklessness. When formulating basic construction plans, they do not proceed from reality and do not act according to their capabilities, so they have to repeatedly change and reduce the planned projects. In this way, the materials purchased and allocated before the plan changes and reductions will inevitably be backlogged.
    Second, many leading cadres in basic construction units have not yet established a comprehensive idea of "good, fast, and economical" in basic construction work. They "emphasize projects and neglect finance" and "do not calculate project costs," believing that "more material storage is a guarantee for the project" and "it doesn't matter if there is some backlog and waste as long as the project is completed." Therefore, they "buy wide and use narrow, and purchase as much as possible" when purchasing materials. They neither properly keep the purchased materials nor use them sparingly; the system for material procurement, storage, and use is either not established or not sound. This inevitably leads to material backlog, waste, and losses.
    In addition, many basic construction departments lack a strict financial management system, the establishment of branches of the Bank of Communications in various places is not yet widespread, and the ability of cadres is low, so the supervision of appropriations is not widespread and in-depth, and it has not played its due role. This is one of the reasons why the phenomena of material backlog, waste, and losses in basic construction departments cannot be overcome in a timely manner.
    In order to solve the current problem of material backlog and waste in basic construction departments, basic construction departments in various regions should conduct a comprehensive inspection of the backlogged equipment with emphasis, planning, and steps, and deal with it according to the circumstances. For equipment that is not needed within the current year or cannot be used due to non-conforming specifications, the competent departments should first try to adjust it within their own scope; among them, some materials that have been stored for a long time and may deteriorate should be disposed of quickly to avoid losses. In order to solve the problem of backlogged materials, the Northeast District Financial and Economic Committee once invited relevant departments and the District Basic Construction Investment Bank to form a "Material Adjustment Office" to supervise various basic construction units to adjust materials to each other. Since this year, the value of adjusted backlogged materials has been more than 400 billion yuan. This method is effective and should be promoted.
    At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the planning of material supply work and improve the material management system. When allocating equipment, it should be adapted to the actual needs of various basic construction units (including the quantity, quality, specifications, and usage time of equipment), and the equipment should not be blindly allocated simply to solve the capital turnover problems of certain production enterprises. Various basic construction departments should formulate feasible material purchase plans and gradually establish a system for purchasing, using, and storing equipment, and approve the necessary reserve quotas and consumption quotas to ensure that they are effectively implemented. Various equipment management departments should cooperate closely with the construction departments to avoid the disconnection between equipment supply and project progress.
    Financial departments at all levels should strengthen financial supervision of the material work of basic construction departments, and serious handling should be carried out for violations of financial discipline by basic construction units. The Bank of Communications at all levels should strengthen the supervision and review of the appropriation of basic construction units, strictly control advance payments, and effectively implement the method of payment according to the progress of the project. The Bank of Communications at all levels should organize a certain force to conduct on-site inspections and, in conjunction with the responsibility system movement being carried out by the construction units, use the method of inspecting and improving at the same time to help basic construction units improve their financial organizations and strengthen system management. Strengthening supervision of basic construction work is not only the responsibility of financial departments and the Bank of Communications at all levels, but also the responsibility of the competent departments and construction units themselves. Therefore, the competent departments must strengthen leadership, pay attention to inspection, and establish a mass supervision system for the construction units under their jurisdiction to overcome the phenomenon of material backlog and waste in basic construction work.

### 克服基本建设方面积压和浪费材料的现象

    克服基本建设方面积压和浪费材料的现象
    根据交通银行各地分支行的检查，许多基本建设单位积压材料和因积压而造成的材料浪费和损失是相当严重的。国家投入基本建设的资金，材料部分一般要占百分之六十上下。大批材料被积压和被浪费，势必使国家投入的基本建设资金遭受损失，并会影响国家基本建设的顺利进行。
    在我国目前设计力量不足，计划不准确，国家物资管理部门还不能完全实现平衡的情况下，有些基本建设单位积压材料是不可避免的。但不少基本建设单位不根据实际需要，盲目地采购和调拨材料，又不加以妥善的管理和使用，以致造成材料积压、浪费和损失的现象，却是不能容忍的。例如，国营陕西第五棉纺厂还没有确定基本建设的设计计划，就购进机器设备达三百零五亿元，结果就积压起来了。有的建设单位采购材料没有计划，常常发生重购多购的现象。今年重庆市电业工程公司在北京、重庆两地分别购料，因为缺乏联系，重购的机器达七亿九千余万元，多购的器材达二十一亿余元。某些主管部门盲目调拨材料，也造成某些材料的积压。东北青城子铅矿得到上级拨下的火药值十二亿九千万元，有八亿元的火药因超过需要而积压起来了。
    造成这些现象的原因很多。首先，不少的建设部门的干部存在着贪多冒进的思想，他们制订基本建设计划的时候，不从实际出发，不是量力而行，以致不得不一再变更和削减计划的项目。这样，在计划变更和削减以前采购和调拨的材料，势必要被积压起来。
    其次，不少基本建设单位的领导干部对于基本建设工作还没有树立“好、快、省”的全面思想。他们“重工程、轻财务”，“不计算工程成本”，认为“多储材料对工程有保障”、“只要完成工程，积压浪费一点不要紧”。因此，在购买材料的时候就“宽打窄用、尽量多购”。他们对采购到的材料既不妥善保管，也不节约使用；材料的采购、保管、使用等制度，或者没有建立，或有制度而不健全。这就不可避免地造成材料的积压、浪费和损失。
    此外，许多基本建设部门缺乏严格的财务管理制度，交通银行各地分支机构设立尚不普遍，干部能力较低，拨款监督工作做得不够普遍深入，未能发挥应有的作用，这也是基本建设部门积压、浪费、损失材料等现象不能及时克服的原因之一。
    为了解决目前基本建设部门积压和浪费材料的问题，各地基本建设部门应该有重点、有计划、有步骤地对积压的器材进行一次全面的检查，分别情况加以处理。对于本年度内不需要的及因规格不符不能使用的器材，各主管部门应在自己的范围内先行设法调剂；其中有些储存已久可能变质的材料，尤应迅速处理，以免遭受损失。东北区财政经济委员会为了解决积压材料的问题，曾邀集各有关部门及区基本建设投资银行组成“材料调剂办公室”，督导各基本建设单位互相调剂材料，今年以来，已调剂的积压材料的价值在四千亿元以上。这种办法是有效的，应该加以推广。
    同时，要加强器材供应工作的计划性，健全器材管理制度。在调配器材时，应该适应各基本建设单位的实际需要（包括器材的数量、质量、规格、使用时间等），不能单纯为了解决某些生产企业的资金周转问题而盲目调配器材。各基本建设部门应该订出切实可行的购料计划，并逐步建立采购、使用、保管器材的制度，核定必要的储备定额和消耗定额，保证切实执行。各器材管理部门应与施工部门密切合作，以免器材供应与工程进度脱节。
    各级财政部门对基本建设部门的材料工作应该加强财政监督，对于基本建设单位违反财政纪律的现象，应该进行认真严肃的处理。各级交通银行应加强基本建设单位拨款的监督和审查，严格掌握预付款项，切实执行按工程进度付款的办法。各级交通银行应组织一定的力量，深入现场进行检查，结合施工单位正在开展的责任制运动，运用边检查、边改进的办法，帮助基本建设单位健全财务组织，加强制度管理。对基本建设工作加强监督，不仅是各级财政部门及交通银行的责任，同时也是各主管部门及建设单位本身的责任。因此，各主管部门必须对所属建设单位加强领导，注意检查，并应建立群众的监督制度，克服基本建设工作中的材料积压和浪费现象。
