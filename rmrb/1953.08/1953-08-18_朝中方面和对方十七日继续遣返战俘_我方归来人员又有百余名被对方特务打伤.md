Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th: On the 17th, our side repatriated 150 non-Korean POWs and 250 Korean POWs (including 25 wounded and sick) to the opposing side. Among the non-Korean POWs, there were 73 Americans, 75 British, and 2 Japanese. The total number of POWs repatriated by our side to the opposing side was 400.

The opposing side repatriated 2,400 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side, of whom over a hundred were injured by Syngman Rhee's police and secret agents with stones during the repatriation.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th: Today, among the repatriated captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, more than 120 were injured during the repatriation. They returned with bandages and plasters; some had blood seeping from their heads and faces. However, the U.S. side listed them as healthy when notifying the number of repatriates yesterday. Park Dong-wan, a returning captured soldier, told reporters that when they arrived at Incheon pier on landing craft yesterday morning, more than 20 Syngman Rhee policemen led more than 100 secret agents to throw stones at them. Three American officers were also present, gesturing and shouting. As a result, more than 120 captured personnel were injured. Since the 15th, every batch of our captured personnel repatriated has been attacked by U.S.-Rhee secret agents during repatriation, with more than 100 to 200 people injured in each batch.

Today the weather was sweltering, and the Panmunjom highway was dusty. The captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, returning in open trucks, drank large quantities of boiled water prepared for them after arriving at our side's exchange area. One captured soldier said after drinking a large glass of water: "We haven't drunk such sweet water since we were captured!" They said that on the journey from Geoje Island to Incheon by ship, the U.S. side did not provide them with fresh water to drink; and when they arrived at Munsan, the U.S. side did not give them clean drinking water, but instead told them to drink the foul water from the ponds.

After seeing our personnel, the returning captured personnel of the Korean People's Army angrily denounced the abuse and massacre they suffered in the U.S. POW camps. Che Dong-hwan, whose legs were as thin as crutches, was helped out of the truck and recounted an incident where U.S. troops used wolves to bite prisoners to death. That was in June last year, after the "Dodd Incident," when the U.S. POW camp commander, the executioner Bonner, brought unprecedented terror to the POW camp. A captured soldier named Wu Jilu was stripped naked and thrown into a pit surrounded by barbed wire more than two zhang high because he drew a flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the wall to express his firm demand to return to his homeland. Then, two vicious military wolves were released to tear at Wu Jilu's body. Wu Jilu could only roll around in the pit, letting out miserable screams. In the end, Wu Jilu was bitten to death, with bones exposed in many places on his body and the pit stained with blood. Che Dong-hwan, who saw this tragedy, was furious and cursed. A U.S. sentry raised his submachine gun and shot him, injuring his legs. He was not given treatment, resulting in his disability.

Another returnee, Hong Yi-kui, whose right leg was disabled, said that in July last year, Park Jin-seon, who was with him, was hanged by the U.S. side for representing the captured personnel in demanding to return to their homeland, and his body was hung on the gallows for three days. The U.S. side also wrote a line of large characters on the back of martyr Park Jin-seon's body: "The End of Returning to North Korea!"

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th: Among our captured personnel repatriated today, more than 200 were injured by U.S.-Rhee secret agents with stones while traveling by train from Incheon to Munsan. According to Yoon Jeol-yeong, a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army whose face was injured, U.S.-Rhee secret agents were ambushed on both sides of the railway curve. When the train passed the curve and moved slightly slower, they took out the stones they had prepared earlier from the baskets and attacked our captured personnel. This is another proof that the U.S. side deliberately harmed our captured personnel during repatriation.

The captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who returned today held up a military blanket with the words "Severely Punish the Executioner Who Massacred POWs - Bonner!" They angrily denounced the serious crimes of Bonner, the former U.S. POW camp commander, in massacring and persecuting POWs. Kim Nam-woon, a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army whose body was covered with scars, accused the U.S. military secret agents of using torture to force him to provide military intelligence, saying that on the night of June 27, 1952, U.S. soldiers suddenly tied him up with ropes and then carried him to a hill near the camp. He saw another captured soldier of the Korean People's Army named Park Young-gang lying there. His body was tied up, and his mouth was stuffed with a towel. A shirtless American was holding two red-hot bayonets and branding his abdomen. Soon, Park Young-gang was branded to death. U.S. soldiers then burned his body with gasoline. Then, the American forced Kim Nam-woon to provide military intelligence, and Kim Nam-woon responded by shouting patriotic slogans. The American then branded his body with a red-hot iron rod, but Kim Nam-woon remained unyielding. By this time, it was already dawn. The American ordered the soldiers to carry him back. Later, he lay there for more than 20 days and could not move. Choi Chung-hwan, another captured soldier of the Korean People's Army whose left eye was stabbed blind, accused that when Bonner came to inspect the camp in June last year, he glared at him angrily, and Bonner ordered a U.S. soldier to rush over and stab out his left eye.

    朝中方面和对方十七日继续遣返战俘
    我方归来人员又有百余名被对方特务打伤
    【新华社开城十七日电】十七日，我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百五十名，朝鲜籍战俘二百五十名（包括伤病者二十五名）。在非朝鲜籍战俘中有美国籍七十三人，英国籍七十五人，日本籍二人。我方遣送给对方的战俘总数为四百名。
    对方遣送给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员二千四百名，其中又有一百多人在遣返途中被李承晚警察和特务分子用石块打伤。
    【新华社开城十七日电】今天遣返归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员中，又有一百二十多人在遣返途中被打伤。他们回来时，带着绷带、胶布，有的人头上、脸上还渗着鲜血；但是，美方在昨天通知遣返人数时，却是把他们列为健康者的。归来被俘人员朴冬万告诉记者，他们在昨天上午坐着登陆艇到达仁川码头时，有二十多个李承晚警察领着一百多名特务向他们投石块，旁边还有三个美国军官在指手划脚地吆喝着，一百二十多名被俘人员因此被打伤。从十五日以来遣返的每一批我方被俘人员在遣返途中都曾受到美李特务的袭击，每批都有一、二百人以上被打伤。
    今天天气酷热，板门店公路上尘土飞扬，坐在敞篷卡车上归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员到达我方交接区后，痛快地喝下了为他们准备的大量开水。一位被俘人员喝下一大杯水以后说：“我们自被俘以后就没有喝过这样甜的水！”他们说，自巨济岛乘船至仁川的途中，美方不供给他们淡水喝；到了汶山，美方又不给他们清洁的饮水，却叫他们喝池塘里的臭水。
    归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员见了我方人员以后，纷纷激愤地控诉他们在美方战俘营中所受到的虐待和屠杀。两腿细得像两根拐杖似的车冬焕被搀扶下车以后，就诉说了一件美军用狼犬咬死战俘的事情。那是在去年六月间，“杜德事件”以后，美方战俘营长官、刽子手波纳给战俘营带来了空前的恐怖。有一位名叫吴基碌的被俘人员因为在墙上画了一面朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗，表示坚决要求回祖国的意志，被美军剥光了衣服绑起来，扔进一个土坑，土坑周围架着两丈多高的铁丝网。然后，两只凶恶的军用狼狗被放进去撕咬吴基碌的身体。吴基碌只能在坑里面打滚，发出凄厉的惨叫。最后，吴基碌被活活咬死了，身上许多地方露出了骨头，土坑里染遍了鲜血。在一旁看到这种惨状的车冬焕怒不可遏，便痛骂起来，一个美军哨兵端起冲锋枪向他射击，打伤了他的两腿，又不给治疗，结果，使他成为残废。
    另一个右腿残废的归来人员洪衣奎说，去年七月间，和他在一起的朴金先因代表被俘人员向美方当局要求返回祖国，竟被美方绞死，并在绞刑架上吊了三天。美方还在朴金先烈士遗体的背上写了一行大字：“回北朝鲜的下场！”
    【新华社开城十六日电】今天遣返归来的我方被俘人员中，又有二百多人在乘火车自仁川到汶山途中被美李特务用石头打伤。据脸部被打伤的朝鲜人民军被俘人员尹节荣说：美李特务均预伏在铁路拐弯处的两侧，当火车经过拐弯处车行稍慢时，他们就从筐子里拿出早已准备好的石块袭击我方被俘人员。这是美方蓄意在遣返途中加害我方被俘人员的又一证明。
    今天归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员高举着一条写着“严惩屠杀战俘的刽子手——波纳！”几个大字的军毯。他们愤怒地控诉前美方战俘营长官波纳屠杀和迫害战俘的严重罪行。一个混身都是伤疤的朝鲜人民军被俘人员金南云控诉美军特务用酷刑逼他供给军事情报的情形说，一九五二年六月二十七日夜里，美军士兵突然用绳子把他捆绑起来，然后把他抬到了营场附近的一个土岗上去。他看见另外一个名叫朴永江的朝鲜人民军被俘人员也躺在那里。他的身子被捆绑着，嘴里还塞着一块毛巾。一个光着上身的美国人正拿着两把烧红的刺刀，烧烙他的腹部。不一会，朴永江就被烙死了。美军士兵随即用汽油把他的尸体烧毁。然后，这个美国人就向金南云逼供军事情报，金南云以高呼爱国口号来回答他。这个美国人就用烧红的铁棍烙他的身子，但是金南云仍然不屈。这时天已亮了。这个美国人就命令士兵把他抬了回去。后来，他一直躺了二十多天，不能动弹。另一个被刺瞎了左眼的朝鲜人民军被俘人员崔忠焕控诉说，去年六月间，波纳来巡视营场的时候，他愤怒地瞪了一眼，波纳就命令一个美国士兵冲过来刺破了他的左眼。
