    The Universal Suffrage Propaganda Work in Songjiang Village, Jiaohe County, Was Not Done Well
    Reader Li Yingtian's letter: The Central Government and all levels of the election committees have instructed that the universal suffrage work must be carried out in close conjunction with production; and that the people's political awareness and production enthusiasm should be further enhanced through the universal suffrage movement. However, the comrades of the universal suffrage work group in Songjiang Village, Eighth District, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, did not work according to this principle. In Songjiang Village, people are engaged in agriculture, as well as fishing, industry, commerce, and freelance professions. The situation is relatively complicated, and the foundation of the mutual aid groups in this village is not good, and some are even on the verge of collapse. After the universal suffrage work group arrived in the village in early July, they did not face up to the above situation, nor did they delve into the thoughts of the masses. When they began to carry out universal suffrage propaganda, they held women's meetings during the day and mass meetings at night. On the evening of July 8, after the mass meeting, a Comrade Yang announced that a women's meeting would be held at noon the next day, but the next day at noon, Comrade Yang and some other cadres went to the big river to take a bath. The women who came to the meeting waited from 1:00 to 2:00, 3:00, and 4:00, but the person in charge of the meeting was nowhere to be seen. Comrade Yang did not return until almost 5:00 in the afternoon. The women were very dissatisfied. Some said, "You are making fun of us at such a busy time!" The women who were going to hoe the fields said, "We were called to a meeting, but the cadres didn't come, wasting half a day's work." At that time, there were still four or five hectares of land in this village that had not been hoeed for the first time. Obviously, the work of the universal suffrage work group affected the production of this village. In addition, the work group's use of blackboards for propaganda was also a failure: 1. There were four or five blackboards at the crossroads in this village, each with a large area written on it, but all of them were written in artistic fonts. After the blackboard newspapers were put out, many people went to see them, but they couldn't understand them. Some reflected, "If it were written in regular script, we could understand half of it, but we have no way of understanding these kinds of characters!" Some took a look at the blackboard newspaper and walked away. 2. The characters were written too small, making it difficult for the elderly to see clearly; some sentences were too long, making it impossible to read them as sentences. 3. Some blackboard newspapers formally pursued quantity, writing twice a day, but before the farmers had seen the first one, the second one was replaced. In the village, due to the development of the cultural learning movement in recent years, the vast majority of farmers have gone from being illiterate to recognizing hundreds or one or two thousand characters. I think the work group must carry out propaganda in light of such practical conditions. Other villages have similar situations. I suggest that the leaders of Jiaohe County quickly check and correct this, and effectively combine it with the current summer hoeing work to do a good job in the universal suffrage work.

### 蛟河县松江村的普选宣传工作没有做好

专栏：读者来信摘要

    蛟河县松江村的普选宣传工作没有做好
    读者李英田来信：中央和各级选举委员会都指示，普选工作必须切实结合生产去进行；通过普选运动进一步提高人民的政治觉悟和生产积极性。但吉林省蛟河县八区松江村普选工作组的同志却没有按照这一原则进行工作。在松江村，人们除了从事农业生产以外，还有从事渔业、工商业和自由职业的，情况比较复杂，而且这个村的互助组的基础也不好，甚至有的正要垮台。七月初普选工作组到村后，没有正视上述情况，也没有深入了解群众的思想。他们开始进行普选宣传时，就白天开妇女会，晚上开群众大会。七月八日晚上，开完群众大会时，一位杨同志宣布第二天午间开妇女大会，可是第二天午间，那位杨同志却和另外一些干部上大河洗澡去了。来开会的妇女们由一时等到二时、三时、四时，还是不见主持会议的人，那位杨同志快到下午五时才回来。妇女们非常不满，有的说：“在这样忙的时候，还拿我们开玩笑！”要下地铲地的妇女说：“召我们来开会，干部不来，白耽误了我们半天的工。”这个村里那时还有四、五垧地没铲完头遍。显然，普选工作组的工作影响了这个村的生产。另外，工作组利用黑板报进行宣传也是失败的：一、这个村的十字路口有四、五块黑板，每块上都写了挺大一片，但写的都是艺术字。黑板报出了以后，不少人去看了，可是看不懂。有的反映：“要是写正字，还能看一半，写这样的字，咱算没门啦！”有的在黑板报前瞅一眼就走开了。二、字写得太小，老年人难看得清楚；有的句子太长，使人念不成句。三、有的黑板报形式地追求数量，一天写两次，可是农民还没有看到第一次的，又换上第二次的了。村中几年来由于开展文化学习运动，绝大多数农民才由不识字到识几百字或一、二千字。我认为工作组必须针对这样的实际情况进行宣传。别的村也有类似情况。我建议蛟河县领导方面赶快检查纠正，切实结合当前的夏锄工作，把普选工作作好。
