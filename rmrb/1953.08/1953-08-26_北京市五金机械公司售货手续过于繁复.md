    Beijing Hardware and Machinery Company's Sales Procedures Are Excessively Cumbersome
    Reader Wang Ruozheng writes: Anyone who has ever purchased materials from the China Hardware and Machinery Company's Beijing branch will have complaints about their cumbersome purchasing procedures. I have been to the company three times, and each time I saw disputes between buyers and the company's staff.
    The company's sales procedure is as follows: The buyer must first go to the company (in the city) to issue seven invoices (two of which are for the buyer, and five are kept by the company; it is unclear why so many copies of the invoice and other documents mentioned below are needed); then go to the company's second warehouse, which is seventeen or eighteen li away from the city, and present the invoice to obtain a weighing notification slip, and another notification slip after the goods are weighed. The buyer must also go to the first warehouse, which is two li away from the second warehouse, to complete the pick-up procedures and pay the loading and unloading fees with the notification slip; the delivery notification form issued by the first warehouse is also seven copies, and the loading and unloading ticket is three copies. The buyer then returns to the second warehouse to pick up the goods and obtains three exit permits before taking the goods away. If the buyer does not pick up the goods within three days, a fine will be imposed, and seven overdue fine tickets must be issued for the fine.
    The above is the smoothest scenario for buying goods; if there is a slight error in the procedures, it will be even more troublesome. Running back and forth between the first and second warehouses adds up to four or five li. Moreover, since the invoice is issued before the goods are weighed, the actual quantity of the goods may not match the invoice, so the buyer has to go back to the company to reissue the invoice and complete the procedures for supplementing or refunding money.
    Why not handle the procedures currently handled by the first warehouse at the second warehouse? Why can't the invoice be issued and the amount of money be determined after the goods are weighed? Many buyers have repeatedly suggested to the company to simplify the purchasing procedures, but the company's reply is always "under research and processing." Their response of "thunder but no rain" cannot satisfy the buyers' demands. It is hoped that the company's leaders will quickly study effective methods to improve the purchasing procedures.

### 北京市五金机械公司售货手续过于繁复

    北京市五金机械公司售货手续过于繁复
    读者王若征来信：谁要到过中国五金机械公司北京市公司购买过材料，谁都会对他们麻烦的购货手续有意见。我到该公司去过三次，每次都看到买货人和该公司工作人员发生纠纷的事情。
    该公司售货手续是这样的：购货人首先要到该公司（在市内）开七张发票（其中两张是给购货人的，五张要存在该公司；发票及以下提到的其它票据为什么要那么多份可不清楚）；然后到距城十七、八里地的该公司第二仓库，凭发票开一张过磅通知票，到货物过磅后又开一张通知票。购货人还得到距离第二仓库有两里路远的第一仓库凭通知票办理提货手续和交装卸费；第一仓库开的提货通知单又是七张，装卸票有三张。购货人再返回第二仓库取货，又开出出门证三张，才能把货拿走。如果购货人在三天内没有提货要罚款，罚款时又须开出过期罚款票七张。
    上面所说的是买货时最顺利的情况；倘若手续上有一点差错，那就更麻烦了，第一仓库和第二仓库之间多跑一个来回就是四五里路。而且由于先开发票，后拿货过磅，货物的实际数量可能和发票不符合，于是购货人还得到公司去重开发票，办理补钱或退钱的手续。
    为什么不把现在第一仓库办的手续就在第二仓库办呢？为什么不能等货物过磅后再开发票和确定钱数呢？很多买货人向该公司一再提出简化购货手续的意见，但该公司的答复老是“正在研究处理”。他们这种干打雷不下雨的答复是不能满足购货人的要求的，希望该公司领导同志迅速研究有效办法，改进购货手续。
