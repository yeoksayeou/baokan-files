From Being Scolded on All Sides to Being Cheered on All Sides
——Township Cadre Zhuang Deji Talks About the Benefits of Overcoming "Five Excesses"
Jiang Shumao Reporting

I am a cadre in Zhao Village Township, Liuting District, Qingdao City. In the spring of 1951, I was elected by everyone as the chairman of the township farmers' association, and then served as the director of the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, the director of the Public Security Committee, a member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, a member of the Livestock Insurance Committee, a member of the Salt Industry Model Evaluation Committee, and a member of the Collection Committee, holding six positions. Over the past few years, I have deeply realized that the excessive number of tasks assigned by higher authorities, meetings, statistical forms, organizations, and concurrent positions are simply overwhelming us. Let's start with the excessive tasks and meetings: last year, in addition to attending the Party Rectification Training Class and the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Training Class organized by the district for 37 days, I had to attend meetings in the district for an average of at least ten days each month. In April, there were particularly many tasks, and therefore particularly many meetings. I attended meetings in the district for fifteen days in that month alone. I remember that one time, twelve tasks were assigned at a single meeting, and the deadlines for these tasks were very tight. Failure to complete them would result in criticism.

How could we complete these tasks on schedule? We had to follow the method arranged by the district – immediately convene meetings of township and village cadres upon returning to the township, followed by a meeting of township people's representatives on the second evening, a village meeting on the third evening, group discussions on the fourth evening, and a meeting of group leaders and village cadres to gather information on the fifth evening. After this series of meetings, the tasks were finally assigned. But before we could catch our breath, the district would send another notice to attend a meeting, calling for a report on achievements and assigning new tasks. In this way, tasks and meetings piled up like Mount Tai, becoming heavier and heavier, making it impossible to move.

Last year, each village in our township had an average of two meetings every night, and an average of six or seven village meetings every month. In early April, four village meetings were held in just one set of five days. Most of these meetings were held in the evenings, lasting until late at night. The long meeting times meant we couldn't get up early in the morning, which delayed production and aroused the opposition of the peasants. Many peasants questioned me: "Chairman! You call for production today and call for production tomorrow. How can we produce if we have so many meetings and don't get enough sleep?" I had no way to explain it to them, so I had to put on a stern face and criticize them for being "backward." But the masses were not willing to accept this label of "backwardness," saying, "Even if we are progressive, we still have to grow crops!" Some village cadres and masses discussed behind my back, "The chairman is a semi-detached cadre who eats public grain. It doesn't matter to him if he holds more meetings, but we are farmers!" When I heard these words, I felt like I had drunk chili water, my heart burning. And that wasn't all. I was often criticized by higher authorities for failing to complete tasks. One thing I find hard to forget is that during the tree planting season last year, the forest farm gave me five days to complete the task of promoting seedlings. At that time, the peasants didn't understand the idea and were unwilling to plant these seedlings. I forced them, compelling them to assign the tasks. The seedlings were assigned, but the masses didn't have money to pay for the trees at the time. Then Comrade Ji from the forest farm severely criticized me for being irresponsible in my work and asked me to make a deep self-criticism.

Furthermore, the number of statistical forms was also truly staggering: last year, we had to make daily reports on the number of flies, mosquitoes, larvae, rats, etc., killed each day in the entire township, and a comprehensive report every seven days. Other departments in the district also had many complex survey and statistical forms. Our four semi-detached township cadres were running around all day long asking for numbers and filling out forms, troubling the masses and exhausting ourselves, but still couldn't get it done. Later, the villages specially established statisticians to help with the statistics, but they were still too busy. In order to avoid criticism and submit reports on time, several township cadres had to squat in the township government and make wild estimates to fill them out and submit them.

Due to the above situation, we had no time to participate in production or to lead production. Last year, I participated in production for a maximum of four or five days each month, and I didn't work a single day in April. The members of my mutual aid team said, "The chairman is no longer a farmer." Some even said I was a "lazybones," only joining the group without working. By the summer, they were unwilling to help each other with me, which resulted in the collapse of the mutual aid team. At home, I was often not let in the door because I came home late at night, and I wasn't given food in the morning because I couldn't get up early. My children were unwilling to talk to me, and my wife scolded me as soon as she saw me for not being at home all day and said I had no conscience, abandoning the whole family. This made me even more distressed. I thought: I put in some effort and sweat to do a good job, but in the end, I earned the displeasure of everyone!

Since the opposition to "Five Excesses" began this spring, to tell the truth, it is really different from previous years. The tasks assigned by the district have been reduced. In the past six months, I have only attended six meetings in the district, spending only four and a half days; these meetings are not only assigning tasks but mainly leading us to check the implementation of policies, methods of completing tasks, work style and effects. The statistical forms have also been greatly reduced. In the past six months, only seven forms have been issued, and the content of the statistics is simpler and clearer than before. At the same time, the work style of the cadres sent by higher authorities has also changed. They discuss everything with us and help us improve our leadership methods. Our four semi-detached township cadres have established a rotating duty system for the office. The comrades on duty, in addition to handling some administrative affairs, also go deep into the fields and mutual aid teams to check the production situation and problems. The comrades who are not on duty can fully devote themselves to production. The township's main cadres' meetings and mass meetings have also been greatly reduced, and it is stipulated that they should be held in the evening, with each meeting lasting no more than two hours, so as not to affect sleep. For example, our township has only held four village meetings, four township people's representative meetings, and several small symposiums in the past six months. This is very popular with the masses. Many people reflect: "In the past, the meetings were about empty talk and boasting. This year's meetings are about doing practical things for everyone. Although the number of meetings has decreased, the benefits are greater than in previous years."

Because the tasks have been reduced, and the focus is clear and properly arranged, I have enough time to participate in production. This year, in addition to doing some odd jobs at home on weekdays, I can spend seventeen to twenty days each month participating in production. Last year, the peasants were unwilling to help each other with me, but this year, seven peasant households volunteered to organize a year-round mutual aid team with me. Now this group is very united. Last year, I had to borrow a lot of grain to cultivate five mu of land, and the land was still barren. This year, I didn't have to borrow a single grain, and all kinds of crops are growing very well. My wife often happily tells people: "Xiaoman's father has changed this year! He is working hard! Our whole family is also harmonious! This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership, which brought good fortune to our family." Not only is my own production good, but more importantly, I have learned some ways to increase production through production and increased my ability to lead production. For example, our township suffered relatively serious natural disasters such as freezing, drought, and insects in the spring wheat this year. Through the mutual aid team I am in charge of and the typical mutual aid team in the township – Wang Gaoye Mutual Aid Team – we promptly set an example and took the lead in taking action, quickly launching a wheat watering campaign, a topdressing campaign, and an insect extermination campaign, eliminating various natural disasters. Not only did the wheat production in the entire township not decrease, but it also increased by more than 15% compared to last year. Some peasants said to me: "With you leading production like this, who wouldn't support you!" Now, I truly realize the benefits of overcoming "Five Excesses," which are: truly completing the tasks assigned by higher authorities, facilitating the production of the masses, and at the same time, making our families harmonious.

    从三面受气到三面欢喜
    ——乡干部庄德吉谈克服“五多”的好处
    姜树茂记
    我是青岛市流亭区赵村乡的干部。一九五一年春天我被大家选为乡农民协会主席，接着又担任了爱国卫生运动委员会主任、治安委员会主任、中苏友好协会委员、牲畜保险委员会委员、盐业评模委员会委员和征收委员会委员等六个职务。几年来，我深刻体会到：上级布置的任务多、会议多、统计表格多、机构多、兼职多，使我们实在招架不了。先就任务多、会议多来说吧：去年我除了参加整党训练班和区上办的互助合作训练班学习三十七天外，每月平均至少还要到区上开十天会。四月份任务特别多，会议也就特别多，一个月就到区上开会十五天。我记得有一次在一个会议上就布置了十二项任务，这些任务限期都很紧急，不完成就得受批评。
    如何按期完成这些任务呢？只好照区上布置的办法——回乡后马上召开乡、村干部会，第二天晚上开乡人民代表会，第三天晚上开村民大会，第四天晚上开小组讨论会，第五天晚上开小组长及村干部汇集情况会。这一连串的会议开过以后，任务总算布置下去了。可是还没等喘过气来，区上又来通知开会，叫汇报成绩，再布置新的任务。就这样，任务、会议像泰山压顶一样，越压越重，动弹不得。
    去年俺乡各村每晚平均要开两个会，每月平均要开六、七个村民大会，四月上旬一个集空（五天）就开了四个村民大会。这些会议大都是在晚上开的，一开就得大半夜。会议时间长了，早上起不来，耽误了生产，惹起农民的反对。不少农民向我提出质问：“主席！你今天号召生产，明天号召生产，开这样多的会，睡不足觉，怎样生产？”我没有办法向他们解释，只好沉下脸来批评他们“落后”。但群众并不肯接受这个“落后”的帽子，他们说：“进步！也不能不种庄稼呀！”有的村干部和群众背后议论说：“主席是个半脱离生产干部，吃的是公粮，多开些会要啥紧，可是我们是庄稼人哪！”我听了这些话后，真像喝了辣椒水一样，心里火辣辣的。光这还不算，完不成任务时我常受到上级的批评。使我难以忘记的一件事，就是在去年植树造林时节，林场限我五天内要完成推广树苗的任务。当时农民思想不通，不愿栽这批树苗。我强迫他们，逼着把任务分派下去。树苗派下去了，可是群众手中一时无钱交不上树款，这时林场的纪同志就严厉地批评我工作不负责任，要我作深刻检讨。
    再说，统计表格多得也实在惊人：去年全乡每天打死的苍蝇、蚊子、孑孓、老鼠等各项数目都要作日报表，七天还要来一次综合上报。区里其他部门同样都有很多内容复杂的调查统计表格。我们四个半脱离生产的乡干部，整天价东跑西窜要数字，填表格，麻烦了群众，累坏了自己，还是搞不了。后来各村曾专门设立了统计员来帮助统计，但仍旧忙不过来。为了不受批评，又能按期上报，只好由几个乡干部蹲在乡人民政府里乱估计一阵，填交上去了事。
    由于以上情况，我们便没空参加生产，也无法领导生产。去年我每月顶多参加四、五天生产，四月份没有干一天活。我那个互助组的组员说：“主席已经不是庄稼人了。”有的甚至说我是“懒汉”，光入组不干活。到了夏天，他们不愿和我一起互助了，结果使互助组垮了台。家里也常因为我晚上回家晚了不给开门，早晨起不来不给饭吃。我的孩子也不愿和我答腔，老婆一见了我就骂我整天不在家，说我没有良心，丢了全家。这一来，我就更苦恼了。心里想：我卖了一些力气，出了一身汗，为的是把工作搞好，可是结果赚了个三面不讨好！
    自从今春反对“五多”以来，说真心话，真与往年大不相同了。区里布置的任务减少了，半年来我只到区上开了六次会，只花去四天半时间；这些会议不单是布置任务，主要是领导我们检查政策执行的情况、完成任务的方法、作风及效果。表格统计也大大减少了，半年来只下达七份表格，统计的内容也比从前简单明了。同时，上级派来的干部的作风也改变了，凡事和我们一起商量着办，并帮助我们改进领导方法。我们四个半脱离生产的乡干部建立了轮流值日的办公制度，值日的同志除了办理一些行政事务外，并深入到田间和互助组内检查生产情况和问题，不值日的同志可以完全投入生产。乡主要干部的碰头会和群众大会，也都大大减少了，并规定在晚上举行，每次会议时间不超过两小时，不影响睡觉。例如俺乡半年来就只开了四次村民会、四次乡人民代表会和几次小型座谈会。这样很受群众欢迎，不少群众反映：“往年开的是南朝北国讲大话的会，今年开的是为大伙办实事的会，别看会议减少了，可比往年得的好处多。”
    由于任务减少了，加以中心明确，又安排得恰当，所以我便有充分时间参加生产。今年我每月除平日在家干一些零星活外，还能拿出十七天到二十天的时间参加生产。去年农民群众不愿和我一起互助，今年有七户农民自愿和我组织了一个常年互助组。现在这个组非常团结。往年我种五亩地得找出很多粮食，还把地荒了；今年一粒粮食未找出，各样庄稼长得都很好。我老婆经常乐得对人说：“小嫚她爹今年转变啦！干活勤快了！俺全家也和睦啦！这都是毛主席领导的好，给俺家带来的福气。”不光自己的生产好，更重要的是通过生产摸到了一些增产门路，增加了领导生产的本领。如俺乡今春小麦遭受了较严重的冻、旱、虫等自然灾害，通过我掌握的互助组和全乡的典型互助组——王诰业互助组，及时作出样子，带头行动，很快就掀起了浇小麦运动、上追肥运动和消灭虫害运动，消灭了各种自然灾害。全乡小麦不但没有减产，而且比去年增产一成五以上。有些农民对我说：“你这样领导生产，谁还不拥护！”现在，我真是体会到了克服
    “五多”的好处，这就是：真正的完成了上级布置的任务，便利了群众的生产，同时，使我们的家庭也和睦了。（原载山东大众日报）
