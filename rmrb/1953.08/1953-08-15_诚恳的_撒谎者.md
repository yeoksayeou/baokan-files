"Sincere" Liars
    Guang You

    On May 3rd, the Grain Storage and Transportation Company of Lalin County, Songjiang Province, issued 130,000 kilograms of third-class corn kernels from the sales department to the Second Grain Depot. Among these, 30,000 kilograms were piled outside due to rain and were not inspected for temperature or quality for ten days. When they were dried on the 18th, it was discovered that over 6,990 kilograms had already become moldy. After drying, turning, and sifting, only over 5,110 kilograms could maintain their original grade (or be lowered by one grade), about 640 kilograms were lowered by two grades, and the remaining 1,220 kilograms were so moldy that they were no longer edible.

    After the grain became moldy, the Lalin County Grain Storage and Transportation Company submitted a report to the Songjiang Province Grain Bureau on May 26th, stating that a total of 5,077 *jin* of grain had spoiled; after inspection and salvage, 450 *jin* were so moldy that they were no longer edible.

    After receiving the report, the Songjiang Province Grain Bureau sent people to Lalin for inspection. The inspectors wanted to weigh the grain to determine exactly how much had spoiled and how much was completely inedible. The head of the Preservation and Chemical Section of the County Company said, "No need to weigh it, we've already weighed it." The result of the Grain Bureau comrades' weighing showed that the spoiled grain was not 5,077 *jin*, but 6,994 kilograms; of which, the inedible portion was not 450 *jin*, but 1,229 kilograms. However, this section head lied to their faces, saying that the report mistakenly wrote "jin" instead of "kilograms" because they were "careless" when writing the report. But the original report number was "5077," while the actual number was "6994"! Regarding this issue, the section head replied, "'5077' was originally an 'estimated' number." Then, how could 1,229 kilograms of inedible grain be estimated as 450 *jin*? The difference is more than four times! This section head argued, "The inedible grain was not included in the report because we had asked the Preservation and Chemical Section of the Provincial Grain Bureau, and they said that inedible grain should not be counted." But the report clearly stated: "After salvaging the spoiled grain, 450 *jin* were inedible" (actually 1,229 kilograms). What's going on? After thinking for a while, this section head stubbornly said: "In any case, we can't submit a false report about the spoiled grain." Strangely, the deputy manager of the County Company and the deputy director of the Grain Depot echoed the section head.

    After this batch of grain spoiled, before the Provincial Grain Bureau sent people to inspect, the deputy manager of the County Company, the head of the Preservation and Chemical Section, and the deputy director of the Grain Depot had all written "self-criticisms" of one or two thousand words. Some said: "The grain spoiled because of my utter bureaucratism"; some said: "My sense of responsibility is not strong"; some said: "I haven't established a worldview of serving the people," and they all proposed methods to prevent grain from spoiling in the future.

    These "self-criticisms" seem very "sincere." They not only "admitted" their mistakes but also had the "determination" to correct them. However, they submitted false reports to the higher authorities, downplaying the loss figures. When the higher authorities sent people to inspect, they still lied to their faces.

    From this, it can be seen that the leading organs can only avoid being deceived by those "sincere" liars and prevent the people's cause from suffering by seriously conducting top-down and mobilizing bottom-up inspections, and checking the results of the implementation of various tasks. At the same time, such "sincere" liars should be ruthlessly exposed for their evil deeds and should be given reprimands and severe punishments.

    “诚恳的”撒谎者
    光友
    五月三日松江省拉林县粮谷储运公司，由门市部发第二粮栈三等苞米?子十三万公斤。其中有三万公斤因下雨堆在外边，十天未检温检质，到十八日晾晒时发现有六千九百九十多公斤已霉坏。经过晾晒、翻扬、过筛子后，能保持原等（或降低一等）的只有五千一百一十多公斤，约降低两等的有六百四十多公斤，其余的一千二百二十多公斤霉坏得已不能食用。
    粮食霉坏了以后，拉林县粮谷储运公司于五月二十六日给松江省粮食厅打报告说，共坏了粮食五千零七十七斤；经过检查抢救后，霉坏得已不能食用的有四百五十斤。
    松江省粮食厅接到报告以后，派人到拉林去检查，检查的人要过秤，看到底霉坏了多少粮食，完全不能食用的到底有多少。县公司保化股股长说：“不用秤了，我们秤过了。”粮食厅的同志过秤的结果，霉坏的粮食不是五千零七十七斤，而是六千九百九十四公斤；其中已不能食用的也不是四百五十斤，而是一千二百二十九公斤。然而，这位股长却当面撒谎说：报告上把“公斤”误写为“斤”，是因为写报告时“马虎了”。但原报告数字是“五○七七”，实际数字却是“六九九四”呀！对于这个问题，这位股长回答说：“‘五○七七’原来是个‘估计’数字”。那么，霉坏得不能食用的一二二九公斤粮食，怎么就能估计成四五○斤呢？相差四倍还多啊。这位股长声辩说：“坏得不能食用的粮食因曾问过省粮食厅保化科，他们说不能食用的不计算在内，因而未报”。但报告书上明明写着：“坏粮经过抢救后不能食用的有四五○斤”（实际是一、二二九公斤），这是怎么回事呢？这位股长寻思了一会还硬着嘴说：“总之，我们坏了粮不能打假报告的。”奇怪的是县公司的副经理、粮栈副主任也跟着这位股长一个鼻孔出气。
    这批粮食霉坏后，在省粮食厅派人检查前，县公司的副经理、保化股股长、粮栈副主任都曾写过一、两千字的“检讨书”，有的说：“粮食霉坏是因为我十足的官僚主义”；有的说：“自己责任心不强”；有的说：“自己没树立为人民服务的人生观”，并且都提出了今后防止粮食霉坏的办法。
    这些“检讨”看起来好像很“诚恳”，他们不但“承认了”错误，而且有“决心”改正错误，但他们却向上级作假报告，缩小损失数字，等到上级派人去检查时，他们还要当面撒谎。
    由此可见领导机关只有认真的进行自上而下和发动自下而上的检查，检查各种工作的执行结果，才不致于受那些“诚恳的”撒谎者的欺骗，也才不致于使人民的事业遭殃。同时，对于这种“诚恳的”撒谎者，应该无情地揭露他们的恶行，并应给予申斥和严厉的处分才好。
