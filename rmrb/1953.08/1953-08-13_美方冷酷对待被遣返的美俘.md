Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 11th: Non-Korean POWs, as they left the Korean-Chinese side to return, all carried expressions of worry about their future fate. In the past few days, Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel returning to our side from Panmunjom personally witnessed the misfortunes encountered by those non-Korean POWs returning to the other side. American soldiers, with bayonets fixed on their rifles, forced the opposing POWs to take off the brand-new blue clothes and white shirts issued by our side, forced them to put on old military uniforms, then loaded them onto trucks and sent them away under the guard of four armed soldiers.

More than 180 of our returning personnel witnessed this situation. More than a dozen people, including Bai Yunde, Liu Changde, Liu Zuhe, Yuan Shuang, and Qiu Zhiming, recounted this incident. They arrived at Panmunjom from the US side's Eighth POW Camp on Jeju Island on August 7th, 8th, and 9th.

They said: When one American POW was slow to take off his clothes, an American soldier used the tip of his bayonet to tear the blue clothes on his backpack. Another black POW, with tears in his eyes, was unwilling to take off his clothes. The American soldier fiercely slapped him twice and stuffed his watch into his own coat pocket.

All repatriated POWs from the other side had kept their personal belongings in the Korean-Chinese side's POW camps. But as soon as they returned to Panmunjom, the American soldiers coldly searched them and took away all their personal belongings—pens, watches—as well as the supplies given to the POWs by the Korean-Chinese side. Standing to the side, Rhee's (South Korean) soldiers took advantage of the American soldiers' inattention to snatch floral handkerchiefs, tea, matches, and shoes and socks from the pile of clothing.

### 美方冷酷对待被遣返的美俘

    美方冷酷对待被遣返的美俘
    【新华社开城十一日电】非朝鲜籍战俘在离开朝中方面回去的时候，都带着对未来命运忧虑的神色。这几天从汶山回到我方来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员亲眼看到了那些回到对方的非朝鲜籍战俘所遭遇到的不幸。拿着上了刺刀的步枪的美国兵，逼着对方战俘脱下我方发给他们的崭新的蓝衣服和白衬衫，强迫他们换上旧的军装，然后装上卡车，派四个拿枪的兵押走了。
    目击这种情形的我方归来人员有一百八十多人，述说这件事的有白云德、刘长德、刘祖和、袁双、邱志明等十多人。他们在八月七日、八日、九日三天由济州岛美方第八战俘营到达汶山。
    他们说：有一个美国战俘脱衣服慢了些，美兵用刺刀尖划破了他背包上的蓝衣服。另一个黑人战俘流着眼泪，不愿意脱衣服，美国兵就凶狠地打了他两记耳光，一把扯下他的手表塞进了自己的上衣口袋。
    所有被遣返的对方的战俘在朝中方面的战俘营里保存了私人的财物。可是他们一回到汶山，美国兵就冷酷地把他们的私人财物钢笔、手表以及朝中方面送给战俘的用品都一起搜走了。站在旁边的李伪军趁着美国兵不注意的时候，从衣物堆中抢花手巾、茶叶、火柴和鞋袜。
