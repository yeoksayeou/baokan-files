    Farmers' Worries After Wheat Harvest in Qiao Jiadi Village, Wugong County
    Chen Taizhi
    Shaanxi Province had a bumper wheat harvest this year. However, many farmers still feel burdened. During the wheat harvest season, young men are laughing and singing, but some older and middle-aged farmers are silent, full of worries.
    Qiao Jiadi Village in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, is a high-yield village in the county. To facilitate comparison and rewards, the county leadership sent two cadres to the village to verify the output. These two cadres worked diligently. During the wheat harvesting season, they calculated in the fields: one bundle, two bundles… During the threshing season, they spent the whole day going from the north end of the threshing ground to the south end, and then back from the south end to the north end, watching who was winnowing and who was using sacks to hold wheat. When they found someone bagging wheat, they would stop and count: one dou, two dou… Then they would take out their notebooks and record how much Qiao Bingkai threshed, how much Qiao Zhicai threshed… Some farmers said uneasily: Look, these two are "supervising the work" and "supervising the threshing ground"! Some farmers simply stopped measuring when the cadres stopped in front of them to wait for them to measure their wheat; others hurriedly stuffed the wheat into sacks without measuring it with a dou, and then quickly carried it home.
    When the two cadres went to Qiao Zhenxi's threshing ground to register the output, Qiao Zhenxi was also reluctant to measure his wheat. After repeated urging from the cadres, he reluctantly measured it and reluctantly allowed the cadres to record his output. The next day, after he winnowed the wheat, he didn't use a dou to measure it or a sack to hold it. He simply carried it home in a dustpan. When the cadres asked him why he didn't measure it, he replied, "It's not winnowed clean." When the cadres asked Qiao Zhenhai how much wheat he had winnowed, Qiao Zhenhai said it was nine dou and four sheng (local dou, each dou weighing thirty jin); but his younger brother said it was one shi and two dou.
    On the evening of June 14th, when I was eating at Qiao Xinliang's house in the village, he asked me very kindly, "Old Chen, this year we harvested more grain. Do you think the output (referring to the normal output used to calculate agricultural tax) will change?" Then he said, "Several families in the village are worried about this." When I told him about the reasonable burden policy of increasing production without increasing taxes, he was more relieved. Just two days before, he was unwilling to report the actual output. On the afternoon of June 12th, he winnowed the wheat, but he did not measure it with a dou. How much wheat he threshed that day is still unclear. In the village, I have already met several families who have raised the same question to me. As soon as the grain is threshed into the granary, some people are already burdened with the worry of "how to set the output" and "whether the public grain will be increased."
    There are also several wealthy households who are secretly worried: with a bumper harvest, more grain has been harvested, and the output has also been verified by the cadres; now, our wealth has been exposed. Next spring, will there be another "invigorate" (referring to "invigorate free lending")? -- Afraid of "exposing wealth," afraid of "invigorating," this is another knot in their hearts.
    Thoroughly and meticulously publicizing and implementing the reasonable burden policy of increasing production without increasing taxes, the policy of protecting farmers' property rights, and the policy of rewarding high yields is still a serious task. Without first explaining the policies to the masses, without relying on the masses, and having a few cadres rashly and isolatedly investigate the farmers' output can only increase the masses' doubts. Doing so makes it impossible to ascertain the actual output; the purpose is to reward high yields, but the effect is to hinder production. In order to increase the enthusiasm of the masses for production and strive for bumper harvests after bumper harvests, the leaders of Wugong County should regard the implementation of various policies related to rural production as an extremely important task, and pay attention to educating every cadre who goes to the countryside to change their style of work and working methods that are divorced from the masses.

    武功县乔家底村小麦丰收后农民的心事
    陈泰志
    陕西省今年麦子丰收了。可是，许多农民心里却还是沉甸甸的。麦收时节，青年小伙子们在欢笑歌唱，有些老年中年农民却默默不语，满肚子心事。
    陕西省武功县乔家底村是县的丰产村。县领导方面为了便于评比奖励，派了两个干部驻村做查实产量的工作。这两个干部辛苦地工作着。割麦时节，他们在地里计算着：一捆、两捆……。碾场时节，他们整天从麦场北头到南头，又从南头折回北头，看谁家在扬场，看谁家在用口袋盛麦。发现谁家在盛麦，就停下来数着：一斗，两斗……。然后掏出笔记本，记上乔炳凯打了多少，乔致才打了多少……。有些农民不安地说：你看，这两个人在“监工”“监场”呢！有的农民，当干部停在他跟前等他量麦时，他就索性不量了；有的不用斗量就仓促地塞进口袋里，然后又匆匆地搬回家去。
    当这两个干部到乔振西的麦场上登记产量的时候，乔振西也迟迟不再量麦子了。经过干部一再督促，他才勉强量了，迫不得已地让干部记下了他的产量。第二天，他把麦扬出来后，既不用斗量也不用口袋盛，干脆用簸箕端回家去了。干部问他为什么不量，他回答说：“没有扬净。”干部问乔振海扬出多少麦时，乔振海说是九斗四升（当地斗，每斗重三十斤）；可是他的弟弟说是一石二斗。
    六月十四日晚上，我在村里乔新亮家里吃饭时，他很亲切地问我：“老陈，今年粮食多打了，你看产量（指计征农业税的常年产量）会不会变啦？”接着他说：“村子里好几家人家都为这放心不下。”当我把增产不增税的合理负担政策告诉了他时，他才比较宽心了。就在前两天，他还是不愿报实产量的。六月十二日下午他扬出的麦，就没经过斗量。当天打了多少麦子，直到现在还没弄清楚。在村子里，我已遇到好几家人向我提出同样的问题。粮食刚打到囤里，一些群众就已经背上了“产量如何订”“公粮是否加重”的包袱了。
    还有几户富裕户也在那里暗自忧心着：丰收了，粮食多打了，产量也被干部查实了；这一下，家底露了头，明年春上，会不会再来一个“活跃”（指“活跃自由借贷”）呢？——怕“露富”，怕“活跃”，这又是一个压在他们心上的疙瘩。
    深入细致地宣传和贯彻增产不增税的合理负担政策、保护农民财产所有权的政策和奖励丰产的政策，还是一个严重的任务。不先把政策交代给群众，不好好依靠群众，由少数干部冒冒失失地孤立地去查农民的产量，只能更增加群众的疑虑。这样做，是不可能把产量弄确实的；目的是为了奖励丰产，效果却是妨碍了生产。为了提高群众的生产积极性，争取丰收之后再丰收，武功县领导方面应当把贯彻执行有关农村生产的各项政策当作一个极其重要的工作，并且注意教育每个到农村去做工作的干部改变脱离群众的作风和工作方法。
