Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai—The work of discussing the national plan in various state-owned and joint state-private heavy industry factories in Shanghai is nearing completion. The purpose of this plan discussion is mainly to revise quotas so as to start formulating and implementing work plans according to advanced and reasonable quotas, further strengthen plan management, and ensure the smooth completion of the national plan. Starting in August, factories have begun to formulate and implement work plans.

The original quotas of Shanghai's heavy industry factories were mostly relatively backward and incomplete, and could not correctly reflect the production capacity of enterprises. This not only caused difficulties in production management, fostered conservative and complacent sentiments and narrow economic viewpoints among some workers, and hindered the improvement of labor productivity, but also aroused dissatisfaction among many advanced workers.

After this discussion of the plan, the quota targets of each factory have been increased. After discussing the national plan, Shanghai Motor Factory can compress more than 153,000 work hours in the second half of this year, which is equivalent to increasing more than 200 labor inputs into production, greatly shortening the production cycle. Shanghai Wire Factory, which produces various cables and wires for the country, has also compressed its work hour quota by about 30% compared with the original plan. As a result, this factory can complete the task of manufacturing cables for high-voltage current transmission in the second half of the year with only a slight increase in equipment. This task has increased by 74% compared with the original plan. According to the new quota targets, Xinhu Iron and Steel Factory can produce 13% to 27% more steel, train wheels, and screws for the country in the second half of the year. The quality indicators of some products have also been improved, and the consumption of raw materials and fuel can be reduced by 4.8% to 28.6%. After raising the quota targets, Tianyuan and Tianli Electrochemical Factories are expected to produce several thousand tons more liquid alkali, bleaching powder, hydrochloric acid, concentrated nitric acid, and more than 100,000 cubic meters of oxygen and acetylene gas in the second half of the year than the national plan.

The factories not only revised and raised quotas, but also improved quota management. After discussing the output targets, Shanghai Motor Factory also discussed quality targets and learned various indicators such as cost, materials, capital turnover, and labor productivity.

Qiujiang Machine Factory originally only had output quotas and no quality quotas, which caused a tendency among the masses to emphasize quantity over quality. After discussing the causes of defective products this time, it is preparing to formulate quota targets. Xinhu Iron and Steel Factory modified and formulated quotas and established a management system.

In the process of discussing the national plan, these factories discovered and solved some important problems existing in their enterprises, and improved the existing production level. Eliminating copper waste is the most important task of Shanghai Smelting Factory. Therefore, the employees of this factory, from the blast furnace and blowing furnace to each operation link of the open-hearth furnace, have worked hard to improve their operations and put forward many rationalization proposals to block the waste of copper in production. For example, the blowing furnace used to be the place where the most copper was wasted in the factory. For each furnace of smelting, the copper sprayed on the furnace cover and in the flue accounted for 15% of a furnace of copper. This time, workers and technicians studied and reduced the size of the furnace tuyeres and motor pulleys, and the amount of air entering the furnace was reduced by one-third compared with the original, so that the molten copper would not spray out of the furnace, and the accumulated copper on the cover and in the flue was reduced to 4%. The high consumption of iron and transformer oil leakage in Shanghai Motor Factory were problems that had not been solved for many years. In this discussion of the plan, the workers and masses put forward many rationalization proposals and launched extensive discussions, and these problems were basically solved.

After discussing the national plan, cadres and workers generally realized the relationship between their enterprises and national construction, strengthened their planning concepts, and strived to complete the national plan. In the process of discussing the national plan in the second quarter, the output of important products such as steel, steel products, electrolytic copper, motors, transformers, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid increased significantly compared with the first quarter. Steel and electrolytic copper did not complete the plan in the first quarter, but completed the plan for the first half of the year due to the production growth in the second quarter. In July, the weather in Shanghai was hot, and the workers in the steel plants were operating in high temperatures, but through the efforts of the workers, the output plans for steel and steel products were overfulfilled, and the actual output of steel was much higher than in June.

### 上海重工业工厂讨论国家计划工作将结束  各厂定额指标都有适当的提高

    上海重工业工厂讨论国家计划工作将结束
    各厂定额指标都有适当的提高
    【新华社上海讯】上海市各国营、公私合营重工业工厂讨论国家计划的工作已将结束。这次讨论计划的目的，主要是修订定额，以便按照先进的合理的定额着手编制和贯彻作业计划，进一步加强计划管理，保证国家计划顺利完成。从八月份起，各厂已开始着手在编制和贯彻作业计划。
    上海各重工业工厂原有的定额大都比较落后和不完全，不能正确反映企业生产能力。这不仅造成生产管理上的困难，助长了部分工人的保守自满情绪和狭隘的经济观点，阻碍劳动生产率的提高，而且也引起很多先进工人的不满。
    经过这次讨论计划，各厂的定额指标都有了提高。上海电机厂在讨论国家计划后，今年下半年全厂可压缩十五万三千多个工时，相等于增加两百多个劳动力投入生产，大大缩短了生产周期。为国家大量生产各种电缆、电线的上海电线厂，工时定额也比原订计划压缩了百分之三十左右。这样做的结果，使这个厂在只增加少许设备的条件下就可以完成下半年制造输送高压电流用的电缆任务。这个任务比原计划增加了百分之七十四。新沪钢铁厂按照新的定额指标，在下半年可以多给国家生产百分之十三到二十七的钢材、火车轮、螺钉等。部分产品的质量指标也有了提高，原料、燃料的消耗可降低百分之四点八到二十八点六。天原、天利电化厂在提高了定额指标后，预计在下半年可以比国家计划多制造出几千吨液碱、漂粉、盐酸、浓硝酸和十多万立方公尺的氧气、乙炔气等。
    各厂不仅修改和提高定额，而且同时健全了定额管理工作。上海电机厂在讨论产量指标后，又同时讨论了质量指标，学习了成本、材料、资金周转、劳动生产率等各项指标。
    虬江机器厂原来只有产量定额，没有质量定额，在群众中产生重量不重质的偏向，这次讨论了废品原因后，准备制订定额指标。新沪钢铁厂修改和制订了定额后并建立了管理制度。
    这些厂在讨论国家计划中，都发现并解决了本企业存在的一些重要问题，把现有的生产水平提高了一步。消灭铜的浪费是上海冶炼厂最重要的任务，因此这个厂从鼓风炉、吹风炉到平炉的每一操作环节的职工，都努力改进了自己的操作，并提出不少的合理化建议，堵塞住了生产的铜的浪费。如吹风炉过去是全厂浪费铜最多的地方，每吹炼一炉，只是喷结在炉子罩壳上和烟道中的铜，就占一炉铜的百分之十五。这次工人、技术人员研究改小了炉子的风眼和马达皮带盘，进炉风量比原来减少了三分之一，使铜水刚好不喷出炉子，罩壳上和烟道中的积铜便减少到百分之四。上海电机厂铁的消耗大和变压器漏油等，是历年来没有解决的问题，在这次讨论计划中，职工群众提了很多合理化建议，展开了广泛的讨论，这些问题便基本上解决了。
    经过讨论国家计划后的干部和职工群众，普遍认识到本企业和国家建设的关系，加强了计划观念，努力设法来完成国家计划。在第二季度讨论国家计划的过程中，钢、钢材、电解铜、电动机、变压器、硝酸、硫酸等等重要产品的产量，都比第一季度有了显著的增长。钢材、电解铜第一季度没有完成计划，但由于第二季度的生产增长而完成了上半年的计划。七月，上海的天气炎热，各钢铁厂工人又是在高温中操作，但经过工人们的努力，钢、钢材的产量计划都超额完成了，而且钢的实际产量比六月份还高出很多。
