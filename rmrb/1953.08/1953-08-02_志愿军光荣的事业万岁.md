    Long Live the Glorious Cause of the Chinese People's Volunteers
    Chen Yi
    When I heard the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on the radio, my dear volunteer comrades, my heart immediately flew out of my door, flew to Korea, and flew to you. I seem to see you all coming out of the tunnel entrances, standing on your own positions, facing the enemy's positions, and shouting loudly, "We have won!"
    I also seem to see Wang Hai and Zhang Jiihui standing up from their cockpits, just like they used to return from defeating the enemy in the air, shouting to their comrades: "We have won!"
    I also seem to see those warriors standing in front of anti-aircraft guns and on the command towers of tanks shouting loudly: "We have won!"
    I seem to see those volunteer commanders I am familiar with, sitting at their desks, with their hands on their chins, emitting knowing smiles, just like they usually hear the good news from the front lines, "We have finally won!"
    And the Korean people, and the Korean People's Army brothers fighting side by side with our volunteer comrades, they must be clenching their fists even tighter, and holding their heads even higher, just like I have seen them express more than once: "Interventionists! One day you will succumb to our righteous fists."
    Now, these heroic words have been proven in front of the people of the world, and I also seem to see them shouting as loudly as our volunteer comrades: "We have won!" "We have won!"
    Dear comrades: This is not entirely my imagination, although we are now separated by our motherland's great Great Wall, and separated by the river of blood that our two peoples have forged—the Yalu River, but all of this is true. The celebratory artillery of Pyongyang, the joy of our army's victory on Shangganling, I seem to have heard and seen with my own ears and eyes.
    Dear comrades: My emotions cannot be suppressed no matter what. I cannot help but think of you. My six-year-old child also said to me, "Dad: The armistice has been signed. I can go to Korea to see the volunteer uncles too!"
    Is it because I have been to Korea twice and studied on the battlefield of victory built by your flesh and blood that I have this kind of uncontrollable emotion? No. I remember one night last November when Deputy Political Commissar Wang of a certain division accompanied me to the front line. I recall the scene when people were sent to the front line to pick me up: the moonlight was sometimes obscured by the shadows of the mountains, and the jeep passed through the river water full of cobblestone bottoms. The moonlight appeared again, reflected on the water, shining brightly. Suddenly the jeep stalled, and the plane flew over from afar. The soldiers did not hesitate at all, and no one directed them. The cold and dampness did not have any effect on them. They all went into the water and immediately pushed the car....
    After that, we traveled dozens of miles. We couldn't see a single civilian, and here the sound of cannons was constant. The fire from the cannons sometimes reddened the sky, but the soldiers were as calm as usual. When asked, "What's up?", the answer was always "Nothing."
    How calm! Just like the lake in front of the position I went to.
    "Brothers," I couldn't help but shout in my heart, dear comrades, I can't find a more appropriate title,
    "How long have you been here?"
    "One month short of a year."
    "One month short of a year. Is this how you've been spending it?"
    "No, when I first came, I was on that mountain," the soldier turned his head and pointed at a rounded mountain that was left behind the car. "We fought more than twenty battles to seize that mountain. I even had to stay in the hospital twice."
    Obviously, they advanced to another mountain, and for this mountain, he went to the hospital twice. Now he is healed, but he has been back to the front line for a month and a half. He said:
    "I can't stay in the hospital. I can't forget this mountain."
    It was for this reason that he left the hospital eight days earlier than the scheduled discharge date.
    Now he is ordered to take us to their tunnel. He said to my companion more than once:
    "It doesn't matter. The closer we are to the enemy, the clearer we can see him, and the better we can beat him!"
    It really doesn't matter. Our People's Army used this trick as early as the Second Revolutionary Civil War. And it works very well.
    Relying on them, dear comrades: also relying on you (they are some of you), we went safely and returned safely.
    I truly experienced selfless and fearless great emotions, and this great emotion is possessed by each of you. This is the reason for your victory, and also the reason why I miss you whenever I am free. I always feel like I owe you something. I haven't stayed in Korea long enough. Now, when the news of the signing of the armistice agreement was announced, many people were sighing:
    "I haven't been to Korea yet!"
    This is an apology, but it is even more a regret for not being able to touch the glory!
    Because you went to Korea to resist American imperialism and defend the security of the motherland, and protecting Korea is the most glorious thing!
    That is why we are grateful to you, and that is why millions of people in the motherland are grateful to you, melting their gratitude into production, study, work, and loyalty to our beloved leader—the great Chairman Mao.
    No one feels that your glory was obtained casually and easily. "A handful of fried noodles and a handful of snow" is recited like an epic in the mouths of every adult and child, melting into their bodies.
    "The uncles are suffering!" the children said.
    "The brothers are not simple!" the adults said.
    This is the voice of all the people of the motherland. Our People's Liberation Army often thinks: "The skills that the volunteer brothers have practiced in Korea are not small. They are enough for us to learn for several years." Dear comrades, I believe that all peace-loving people in the world will not forget you, and will always remember you. It is the "highest" honor that a person can receive in life, as our Chinese often say.
    I think you will be satisfied. I think you will also think of the responsibilities you have undertaken and the missions you have completed in the past. I think you will even more think of the responsibilities you now and in the future have to undertake and the missions you have to complete, as Commander Peng Dehuai said: "The armistice agreement that has now been signed is of a military nature and is only the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The withdrawal of all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, from Korea, the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the spirit of the Korean people handling their own affairs, and the establishment of a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent new Korea, all remain to be negotiated at a higher-level political conference. The Chinese people have always advocated resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation, and the Chinese people are willing to be a strong backing for the peaceful resolution of international issues." He also said: "If any warmongers, especially the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique, dare to continue their sinful activities of undermining the Korean armistice, their conspiracy will inevitably be met with the firm opposition of the peace-loving people of the world and will end in a shameful failure." Therefore, Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai said in their order on the 27th:
    "(1) All personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers' army, air force, navy, and coastal defense forces must resolutely abide by the armistice agreement, and from 22:00 on July 27, 1953, that is, twelve hours after the signing of the armistice agreement, completely cease fire across the entire line; within seventy-two hours from 22:00 on July 27, 1953, that is, seventy-two hours after the armistice agreement takes effect, all lines shall uniformly withdraw two kilometers behind the military demarcation line already announced by both sides, and shall not enter the demilitarized zone one step further.
    "(2) All personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers' army, air force, navy, and coastal defense forces should maintain a high degree of vigilance, hold their positions, and prevent any invasion and sabotage actions from the other side."
    This is also the hope of the people of the motherland, the voice of the people of the motherland, and also your hope, your voice.
    Dear comrades: Victory! The people of the motherland cheer for your victory! Our brothers in the People's Liberation Army also cheer for your victory! Your blood, sweat, suffering, and fatigue have created happiness for mothers and children all over the world, and have built a barrier for the construction of our great motherland. The motherland will be better constructed due to your victory and further victories. One day, you will also return and participate in the construction with the people of the motherland, and when you return, the victory of peace in the world will be even greater, and more people will participate in the peace camp.
    Now, we all know that you are thinking of the motherland, but we also know that you are even more thinking of how hard-won your victory was. Before the Korean issue is fully resolved, you will maintain a high degree of vigilance in victory, just like when the negotiations began, and you will not slack off in the slightest because of victory.
    The people of the motherland firmly believe in this, because the blood you shed in Korea and the immortal feats you have made for the motherland and the people of the world have long proved this. You will always be victors! The enemy can never defeat you!
    Comrades, dear comrades! Long live! Long live your glorious cause! Long live your close comrades-in-arms—the Korean People's Army, and the heroic Korean people!

    志愿军光荣的事业万岁
    陈沂
    当我从广播上听到朝鲜停战协定签字的时候，亲爱的志愿军同志们：我的心立刻飞出了我的门口，飞到了朝鲜，飞到了你们的面前。我好像看到你们都走出了坑道口，站在你们自己的阵地上，面对着敌人的阵地，大声呼喊：“我们胜利了！”
    我也好像看到王海、张积慧从他们的座舱里站起来，像他们过去从空中击败敌人回来一样，对着他们的战友呼喊：“我们胜利了！”
    我也好像看到那些站在高射炮面前，站在坦克的指挥塔上的勇士们在高声呼喊：“我们胜利了！”
    我更好像看到我熟悉的那些志愿军的指挥员同志，坐在他们办公桌面前，跟平常听到前线的捷报一样，手忖着腮，发出会心的微笑，“我们毕竟是胜利了！”
    而朝鲜人民，和我们志愿军同志们并肩作战的朝鲜人民军兄弟，他们一定跟往常一样，把他们的拳头更加捏得紧了，把他们的头更加高昂起来，像我曾经不只一次看过他们所表示的一样：“干涉者呵！你们终有一天要在我们正义的拳头下屈服的。”
    现在，这些英雄的语言，在全世界人民面前得到了证明，我好像也看到他们跟我们志愿军同志一样在高声呼喊：“我们胜利了！”“我们胜利了！”
    亲爱的同志们：这完全不是我的想像，虽然我们现在远隔着我们祖国伟大的长城，远隔着我们两国人民用血结成的战斗的河——鸭绿江，但这一切都是真的，平壤庆祝胜利的礼炮，上甘岭上我军胜利的欢乐，我仿佛都亲耳听见了，都亲眼看见了。
    亲爱的同志们：我的感情无论如何也抑制不住，我不能不想着你们，我的六岁的孩子也向我说：“爸爸：停战了，我也可以到朝鲜看志愿军叔叔了！”
    是不是因为我曾经去过两次朝鲜，在你们用血肉筑起来的胜利战场上学习过而才发生这种难以抑制的感情呢？不是。我记起去年十一月有一天晚上某师王副政委陪我到前沿阵地去时，阵地上派人来接我的情景：月光忽而被山阴遮着，吉普车通过满是鹅卵石底的河水，月光又出现了，倒映在水上，闪闪发光，忽然吉普车灭火了，飞机从远远飞过来，战士没有一点犹豫，也没有谁指挥他，寒冷、水湿，根本在他们身上就没有起一点作用，不约而同地都下水去，并且马上推车……。
    此后，一路走了几十里，看不见一个老百姓，而这里大炮声不断，大炮发射出来的火光有时使天都发红，战士却像平常一样坦然，问他“有啥”，总是答“没啥”。
    多么平静呀！就像我去的那个阵地前面的湖水一样。
    “兄弟，”我不禁心里这样喊，亲爱的同志们：我再找不出更适当的称呼，
    “你在这里好久了？”
    “还差一月，一年。”
    “还差一月，一年。你就是这样过的吗？”
    “不，刚来时我在那个山，”战士回头指望着被扔在车后的一个圆顶山，“为了争夺那个山，我们打过二十多次仗，我还到医院去住过两回。”
    很显然，他们前进了又一个山，而为了这个山，他去住了两次医院。现在他才好，但他已经回到阵地一月有半了。他说：
    “在医院呆不住，总忘不了这个山。”
    就是为了这个，他按预定的出院期早出院八天。
    现在他是奉命来接我们到他们的坑道，他不只一次地跟我的同伴说：
    “没关系，越靠近敌人，就越清楚敌人，就越能揍他！”
    实在是没关系，这一套，我们人民军队远在第二次革命战争时期就用了。并且是很灵验的。
    依靠他们，亲爱的同志们：也是依靠你们，（他们就是你们中的一些）我们平安地去，平安地回来了。
    我真正的体会到了无私的，也是无畏的伟大感情，而这个伟大的感情是你们每一个人都具备着的，这就是你们胜利的道理，也是我一空下来就想念你们的道理。我总觉我像欠了债似的，我在朝鲜没有住够。现在，当停战协定签字的消息宣布出来时，不少的人都在慨叹：
    “我没去过朝鲜哩！”
    这是歉意，但更是没有接触到光荣的遗憾！
    因为你们为了抗击美帝国主义，保卫祖国安全，而去朝鲜，而保卫朝鲜，是最光荣的！
    我们就是因为这样才感激你们，千千万万的祖国人民也是因为这样才感激你们，把感激融化在生产、学习、工作、以及忠实于我们敬爱的领袖——伟大的毛主席身上。
    没有一个人觉得：你们的光荣，是随随便便、轻而易举得来的，“一把炒面一把雪”，像史诗一样，在每个大人、小孩的口中念着，在身上融着。
    “叔叔们苦呵！”孩子们说。
    “兄弟们不简单呵！”大人们说。
    这就是祖国全体人民的话。我们解放军更常常想着：“志愿军兄弟们在朝鲜练的本事可不小，真够我们学几年的。”亲爱的同志们，我相信，世界上所有爱好和平的人民都不会忘记你们的，都会永远记得你们的。一个人活着能够受到这样的荣誉，正是我国人常说的“至高无上”的了。
    我想，你们会满足的；我想，你们也会想到你们过去已经担负的责任和完成的使命；我想，你们更会想到你们现在和将来要担负的责任和要完成的使命，即彭德怀司令员所说的：“现在所签订的停战协定，是属军事性质的，还只是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。一切外国军队包括中国人民志愿军在内撤出朝鲜，朝鲜问题在朝鲜人自己处理自己问题的精神下的和平解决，一个统一、民主、和平、独立的新朝鲜的建立，尚有待于高一级的政治会议去协商。中国人民是一贯主张以和平协商方式解决国际争端的，中国人民愿意为和平解决国际问题作坚强的后盾。”他又说：“任何好战分子，特别是南朝鲜李承晚集团如果敢于继续他们的破坏朝鲜停战的罪恶活动，他们的阴谋必将遭受世界爱好和平人民的坚强反对而归于可耻的失败。”所以金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员才在二十七日的命令上说：
    “（一）朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的陆军、空军、海军、海防部队全体人员应坚决遵守停战协定，自一九五三年七月二十七日二十二时起，即停战协定签字后的十二小时起，全线完全停火；在一九五三年七月二十七日二十二时起的七十二小时内，即停战协定生效后的七十二小时内，全线一律自双方已经公布的军事分界线后撤二公里，并一律不得再进入非军事区一步。
    “（二）朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的陆军、空军、海军、海防部队全体人员应保持高度戒备，坚守阵地，防止来自对方的任何侵袭和破坏行动。”
    这也正是祖国人民的希望，祖国人民的声音，也是你们的希望，你们的声音。
    亲爱的同志们：胜利了，祖国人民为你们的胜利欢呼！我们解放军的兄弟们也为你们的胜利欢呼！你们的流血、流汗、受苦、受累，为全世界的母亲和孩子缔造了幸福，为我们伟大的祖国建设修起了屏障。祖国，将因你们的胜利再胜利而更好地建设了。有一天，你们也会回来和祖国人民一起参加建设的，而当你们归来的时候，和平在全世界的胜利将更大了，参加和平阵营的人更多了。
    现在，我们都知道你们在想念祖国，但是我们也知道你们更在想念你们的胜利来得不易。你们，在朝鲜问题没有获得全部解决之前，也会跟开始进行谈判时一样会在胜利中提高警惕的，不会为胜利而有丝毫松懈的。
    祖国人民非常相信你们这一点，因为你们在朝鲜所流的血，为祖国，为世界人民所立下的不朽功勋早已证明了这一点。你们永远会是胜利者！敌人永远打不败你们！
    同志们，亲爱的同志们！万岁！你们光荣的事业万岁！你们亲密的战友——朝鲜人民军、英雄的朝鲜人民万岁！
