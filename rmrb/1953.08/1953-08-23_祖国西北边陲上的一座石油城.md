    An Oil City on the Northwestern Border of the Motherland
    Xiang Yang
    In people's impressions, the Great Northwest of the motherland is a desolate Gobi desert. The poet Du Fu once wrote, "The spring breeze does not pass the Jade Gate Pass," which describes the desolate scene there. Indeed, those who have been to the Northwest will know that the further northwest you go from Lanzhou, Gansu, the more desolate it becomes. After passing Yongdeng County, the car travels all day, and you can't see a single household or pedestrian for hundreds of kilometers.
    However, the desolate appearance of the Northwest Plateau is already beginning to change. With the development of the motherland's economic construction, teams of workers, technicians, and commercial staff who are developing the motherland's treasures have come here. The lively sound of machines has shattered the silence of this place, and the bright electric lights have illuminated some of the valleys that have been dark for many years. Some new industrial cities have begun to appear in this Gobi desert. The Lao Jun Miao Oil Mine, an oil city at the northern foot of the Qilian Mountains, is one such new city.
    The Lao Jun Miao Oil Mine is located in the Jiuquan Basin at the northern foot of the Qilian Mountains. The Jiuquan Basin is situated between the northern and southern mountains. The Qilian Mountains stand tall in the south, and the Heli Mountains are close to the north of the basin. The entire Jiuquan Basin is about 20 kilometers long from east to west and more than 40 kilometers wide from north to south, covering an area of about 4,400 square kilometers. This is currently the richest area in the motherland for the production of natural petroleum. It was developed during the Anti-Japanese War, but after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries were keen on promoting the oil of American imperialism and abandoned the Lao Jun Miao Oil Mine. It was not until after liberation that the rich "black gold" (crude oil) underground in the Jiuquan Basin found its true owner. Now, the face of the Lao Jun Miao Oil Mine has fundamentally changed. The old workers said with a smile: "Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have come, and everything in Lao Jun Miao has changed, even the weather has become better!" Indeed, even the climate of Lao Jun Miao has changed. In the past, the Northwest was arid all year round, but now it often rains. Last year, the rainfall in Lao Jun Miao reached a record high in sixty years. Of course, the biggest change is that a people's oil city stands in the desolate area of ​​Northwest China with a brand-new posture.
    When our car arrives at Jiuquan (83 kilometers from Lao Jun Miao), we can gradually see the outline of the oil mine. The chimneys of the new refineries, power plants, machine factories... are emitting thick smoke, and rows of towering derricks are neatly lined up. At this time, the car is running smoothly and quickly. The young driver told us that the road surface of this 80-kilometer-long highway from Jiuquan to the Lao Jun Miao Mine is paved with asphalt, a by-product of the oil mine. Then he looked at a large area of ​​new buildings and excitedly continued to tell us that those beautiful buildings are children's nurseries, a large auditorium, Qilian villas, office buildings, hospitals, and schools, and those buildings are residences for employees and their families... He was so interested in saying it.
    Now Lao Jun Miao, where the oil mine is located, has been officially changed to a city. When we arrived at Lao Jun Miao City, the situation was indeed exciting. In this desolate Northwest, there are already well-equipped hospitals and schools, as well as department stores and cooperatives with a full range of goods, and post and telecommunications bureaus. The cultural life in this oil city is also so active. The mine has a cultural troupe, as well as cinemas and theaters. All employees of the mine and their families can often see good movies and dramas here. In addition, there is a small newspaper called "Petroleum Workers," which is a spiritual food loved by all employees of the mine, and many workers often write articles for "Petroleum Workers."
    In the past three years, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, all employees of the Lao Jun Miao Oil Mine have launched production competitions, rationalization proposals, and finding shortcuts movements, which have made production indicators rise linearly. According to incomplete statistics, labor productivity has increased by about two times in the past three years, and the oil refining rate and output have exceeded the highest level before liberation. The Dabus Refinery is a large-scale factory. In the past, it would have taken two years to build such a factory. Now, with the selfless labor of all employees of the mine, it was completed in one hundred and twenty days.
    In the past few years, the enthusiastic and selfless help of Soviet experts has played a decisive role in the construction of the Lao Jun Miao Oil Mine. As soon as Soviet experts Nelejin and Moseyev arrived at the Lao Jun Miao Oil Mine, they discovered that there were huge shortcomings in our oil mine's drilling work. The drilling efficiency was very low, especially in the long winter (more than half a year), the drilling equipment and personnel were idle and could not be started, which was a great waste! Based on Soviet experience, the experts put forward some specific measures for winter drilling, overcoming the past belief that there was no way to drill wells in winter, greatly improving labor productivity.
    The future of the Lao Jun Miao Oil Mine is exceptionally bright. How much is the reserve of the Lao Jun Miao Oil Mine? In the past, some of our geologists calculated it too conservatively, estimating that there were only a few million tons of reserves. Now, according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, scientific calculations have been carried out. The known exploitable reserves of the Lao Jun Miao Oilfield are now at least several times higher than the previous estimates. And new oil-bearing formations are still being discovered.
    The construction of the people's oil city—the Lao Jun Miao Oil Mine—is now just a beginning. (Attached picture)

    祖国西北边陲上的一座石油城
    向阳
    在人们的印象中，祖国大西北是一片十分荒凉的戈壁沙漠。诗人杜甫曾经写道：“春风不渡玉门关”，就是描写那里的荒漠情景的。确实，到过西北的人就会清楚，从甘肃兰州再向西北进，愈走愈荒凉。过了永登县城之后，汽车跑上整天，数百公里之内看不到一户人家，碰不上一个行人。
    但是，现在西北高原的荒凉面貌已经在开始改变了。随着祖国经济建设的展开，开发祖国宝藏的工人们、技术人员们和商业工作人员们一队队的来到了这里，热闹的机器声已经震破了这儿的静寂，明亮的电灯光也照亮了一些黝暗了多少年的山谷，一些新的工业城市，已开始在这戈壁沙漠里出现。在祁连山北麓的一座石油城——老君庙油矿就是这样的一座新城市。
    老君庙油矿位于祁连山北麓的酒泉盆地。酒泉盆地处在南北大山之间，祁连山耸峙于南，合黎山紧靠盆地的北面，整个酒泉盆地东西长约二十公里，南北宽约四十余公里，面积约为四千四百平方公里。这里是目前祖国天然石油出产最富饶的地区。它在抗日战争时期就曾经开发过，但抗战胜利后，国民党反动派热衷于推销美帝国主义的石油，就把老君庙油矿弃置不顾了。直到解放以后，酒泉盆地地下丰富的“乌金”（原油）才找到了它真正的主人。现在，老君庙油矿的面貌已根本改变了，老工人们笑呵呵地说：“毛主席共产党来了，老君庙一切都变了，连天气都变好啦！”真的，老君庙连气候也变了，过去是长年干旱的西北，现在也经常下起雨来了，去年老君庙的雨量就达到了六十年来所未有的记录。当然最大的变化还是在于：一座人民的石油城以崭新的姿态屹立在祖国西北荒漠地区。
    当我们汽车到达酒泉（距老君庙八十三公里），再往前进，就渐渐地可以看到油矿的轮廓，新的制炼厂、发电厂、机厂……的烟筒在冒着浓烟，一排一排高耸天际的井架，很整齐地林立着。这时汽车行驶得平稳而迅速，年轻的汽车司机告诉我们：这条由酒泉到老君庙矿的八十多公里的公路，路面就是油矿副产品沥青铺设的。接着他又望着一大片的新建筑物兴致勃勃地继续告诉我们，那些漂亮的建筑物是儿童保育院，是一座大礼堂，是祁连别墅，是办公大楼，是医院和学校，那一幢幢的是职工家属的住宅，……他是说得那么有兴趣。
    现在油矿所在地的老君庙，已正式改为市。我们到了老君庙市，情形确实是令人兴奋的。在这荒漠的西北，已有了设备完善的医院和学校，也有百货齐备的商店和合作社，有邮局和电信局。这座石油城市里的文化生活也是如此活跃，矿上有一个文工团，又有电影院和戏院，全矿职工和他们的眷属在这里经常能看到好的电影和话剧。此外还有“石油工人”小型报纸，这是全矿职工所喜爱的精神食粮，很多工人经常替“石油工人”写稿。
    三年来，老君庙油矿的全体职工，在共产党正确的领导下，在苏联专家的热诚帮助下，展开了生产竞赛和合理化建议及找窍门运动，使生产指标直线上升，根据不完全的统计，劳动生产率三年来上涨了两倍左右，原油的炼率和产量都已超过解放前的最高水平。达布斯炼油厂是一个规模浩大的厂，要是在过去建设这样一个厂非得二年时间不行，现在在全矿职工的忘我劳动下，一百二十天就兴建完成。
    几年来，苏联专家热情无私的帮助，对老君庙油矿的建设，起了决定性的作用。苏联专家聂列金、莫谢耶夫等一到老君庙油矿，就发现我们油矿的钻井工作中有巨大的缺点，钻井工作效率很低，特别是在漫长的冬季（一年中有半年以上的时间），钻机设备和人员都闲置着不能开动，这是多大的浪费！专家根据苏联的经验，提出了冬季打井的一些具体措施，克服了过去认为毫无办法的冬季打井，大大提高了劳动生产率。
    老君庙油矿的前途是异常远大的。老君庙油矿的蕴藏量究竟有多少，过去我们有些地质家计算得太保守，估算只有几百万吨的埋藏量。现在根据苏联专家的建议，进行了科学的计算，老君庙油田现在已知的可开采量至少比过去的估计要高出数倍。而且还在继续发现新的储油层位。
