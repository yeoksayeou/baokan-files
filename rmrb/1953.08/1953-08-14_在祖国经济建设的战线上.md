Xinhua News Agency: Shanghai's Some Hardware and Electrical Machinery Factories Successfully Trial-Produce Electro-Optical Safety Brakes

    Some hardware and electrical machinery factories in Shanghai have produced an electro-optical safety brake. Installing this electro-optical safety brake on large punch presses and other machine tools can eliminate industrial accidents. The electro-optical safety brake was first successfully tested by Zhuang Kangyu, a worker at Shanghai Factory 106. The electro-optical safety brake designed and manufactured by Zhuang Kangyu for the blanking machine has a photoelectric tube installed on the right side of the blanking machine and a light on the left side, with the light aimed at the photoelectric tube. During blanking, if a worker carelessly puts their hand into the machine, the hand will block the light. In this way, the light will not reach the photoelectric tube, the current will be interrupted, and the machine will stop immediately without power, so workers do not have to worry about crushing their hands during operation.
    After Factory 106 installed the electro-optical safety brake on the blanking machine, the Shanghai Hardware Trade Union organized employees from many hardware and electrical machinery factories to visit. This July, the Xin'an Electrical Machinery Factory successfully installed an electro-optical safety brake on a punch press. The Samsung Zipper Factory and Yongxin Electrical Appliance Factory are also currently conducting tests.

Xinhua News Agency: Shanghai Construction Workers Create and Improve a Large Number of New Tools and New Working Methods

    In the past year, construction workers in Shanghai have created and improved a large number of new tools and new working methods. Some of these new tools and new working methods increase work efficiency by three to five times, such as the complete set of improved plastering tools for plasterers, tile sawing machines, lime polishing machines, self-flowing lime slaking methods, and woodworking tools such as edge pullers, end trimmers, long-handled planers, and planing limit boxes. Some increase work efficiency by ten to twenty times, such as electric saws for "M" shaped wood pilings and tenon milling machines. Others increase work efficiency by fifty to one hundred percent, such as new tools for painting window sills and open drains. After these new tools and new working methods are applied on construction sites, they have increased a large amount of wealth for the country. For example, after the complete set of improved plastering tools was promoted and used on the construction sites of 20,000 worker housing units, it saved the country more than 7 billion yuan. As another example, after the electric saw for "M" shaped wood pilings was used on the construction sites of 20,000 worker housing units, it not only saved more than 5,000 workdays compared to using axes to cut pilings, but also saved more than 80,000 board feet of timber in sawing 40,000 pilings.
    The new tools and new working methods created and improved by Shanghai construction workers have two characteristics: First, most of the new tools and new working methods have helped to promote advanced working methods in construction projects. For example, after Huang Yongai's advanced plastering method was promoted on the construction sites of 20,000 worker housing units, the efficiency of plastering walls increased threefold, but difficulties such as insufficient scaffolding and mortar supply arose. The self-flowing lime slaking method and the successful development of adjustable wooden high stools by the workers solved these difficulties in a timely manner. Second, some new tools are close to the point where mechanical operation can be implemented. For example, the tile sawing machine created by technician Gu Shiming and the lime polishing machine created by Fang Jinhai can become very good machines as long as power equipment is installed.

Xinhua News Agency: Chongqing State-Owned and Local State-Owned Factories Improve Production Equipment and Lower Workshop Temperatures

    State-owned and local state-owned factories in Chongqing are actively improving production equipment, lowering workshop temperatures, and improving the working conditions of employees. State-owned Factories 201, 202, 206, and Chongqing Electrical Equipment Factory, etc., four machinery factories, added insulation covers around twenty forging furnaces with non-standard products and transformed two forging furnaces with standard products into reverberatory furnaces. This concentrates the heat of the furnaces inside the furnace, reducing the temperature of the workshop. After Factory 202's forging workshop modified the forging furnaces, the workshop temperature dropped from 66 degrees Celsius to 48 degrees Celsius. The forging workshop of Factory 27497 completely sealed the red furnaces with refractory bricks and ordinary bricks, leaving only the furnace door outside, and opening chimneys on top, so that heat is concentrated and transmitted outdoors. This not only lowered the workshop temperature, but also reduced the amount of dust in the room. In the past, red steel from the second field of the 101 Steel Plant was transported to the rolling mill by manpower. It has now been changed to machine transportation, so that workers are no longer subjected to the scorching of hot red steel, and the labor intensity of the workers has also been reduced.
    After the workshop temperature was lowered, the phenomenon of workers in high-temperature workshops fainting due to heat has been greatly reduced. Absenteeism due to illness and injury has also been significantly reduced. For example, in the rolling mill of Factory 101, the average number of workdays missed due to illness and injury in May was 1.13 per person, which was reduced to 0.86 in June.

Xinhua News Agency: Northeast Establishes a Mechanical Afforestation Experiment Station

    In order to complete the construction plan of the western protective forest belt in Northeast China ahead of schedule, the Forestry Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee has officially established China's first mechanical afforestation experiment station in Kaitong County, Heilongjiang Province. This autumn, it will begin to test the use of machines for land reclamation and afforestation. Using machines for afforestation can plow more than twice as deeply as manual afforestation, thus improving the survival rate of seedlings and greatly speeding up the speed of afforestation. The Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experiment Station has now transported tractors, tree planting machines, cultivators, and various machines such as four-bottom plows, five-bottom plows, and disc harrows. At present, the station has also opened a mechanical afforestation training class to vigorously train cadres. The first batch of trainees will graduate by mid-October.

Xinhua News Agency: The Movement to Guarantee Workers Eight Hours of Sleep

    Since the end of June, the families of workers at the State-owned Shanghai No. 7 Cotton Textile Factory have launched a movement to ensure that workers get eight hours of sleep, so that workers can engage in production with vigor.
    In the past, many workers could not sleep well due to the noise in the workers' dormitory and the noise of children. In this movement, 42 family groups in the workers' dormitory signed a convention stipulating that family members should supervise workers to go to sleep and not let them do housework; to take good care of their children and not make noise, and to ensure that they do not make loud noises; not to wear wooden slippers that affect other people's sleep, etc. The group holds a meeting once a week to check. The factory's labor protection and welfare department also actively helps workers with many children and small houses to solve their difficulties, set up night work sleeping rooms, assisted family members in setting up nurseries in the dormitory, and built a large shed for children over the age of seven to cool off, play games, and read and draw. Children are also organized, with older children leading younger children to play games, do homework, and swat flies for hygiene work.
    Now a new atmosphere has emerged in the workers' dormitory area. Many night shift workers put up small red flags with the words "Night Work" in front of their doors to remind everyone to avoid making noise nearby. The environment around the dormitory is also much quieter. Guo Jinshan's mother is a spinning worker who used to sleep less than five hours and never completed her production plan. Now her son does not let her do housework, and she sleeps for eight hours a day. Her production enthusiasm is very high. Her plan for July was to spin 91 carts of yarn per day, but she has now spun 97 carts. One female worker used to take frequent sick leave every summer because she could not support herself due to lack of sleep, but she has not taken a single day of leave this year and has expressed her desire to win the red flag. The eight-hour sleep movement has played a role in reducing absenteeism. In July, the weather was hot, but the number of absentees in the factory not only did not increase, but decreased compared to June.

Xinhua News Agency: Cabbage Grows in Tibet

    In the east of Mozhugongka, upstream of the Lhasa River, in a small garden in Gadong, a Tibetan village, there is a small patch of tender, lush head cabbage and black cabbage. In the past, these two kinds of vegetables did not grow in Tibet. The seeds of these two kinds of cabbage were a gift from Zhu Decai, a model communication worker from a certain company of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to Gadong.
    When the People's Liberation Army marched into Tibet in 1950, Zhu Decai rarely saw Tibetan farmers planting vegetables along the way. Although some people planted a little cabbage, this cabbage generally did not grow large. Zhu Decai wrote a letter to his mother asking her to send some vegetable seeds. In 1951, Zhu Decai received a reply from his mother and seeds of head cabbage, black cabbage, and Henan cantaloupe. These seeds were not easy to get to the Kangzang Plateau. They were transferred for more than 10,000 li through Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Xikang provinces. Zhu Decai arrived in Mozhugongka. When planting this spring, he took some seeds of head cabbage and black cabbage and gave them to his landlord Gadong, who quickly planted them in his small garden. The seedlings emerged, and he carefully nurtured them, watering and weeding them often. The cabbage grew more vigorously day by day. The local Tibetans, hearing that Gadong had planted cabbage from the interior of the motherland, often came to see how the cabbage was growing. Head cabbage and black cabbage are indeed good varieties. They grew quickly and were larger than the local cabbage varieties planted at the same time, and they also tasted better. As soon as the cabbage began to bolt and flower, people came to Gadong to ask for seeds.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    上海部分五金、电机工厂试制电光安全制动器成功
    上海市部分五金、电机工厂制出了一种电光安全制动器。这种电光安全制动器安在大型冲床和其他工作母机上，可以消灭工伤事故。电光安全制动器，是上海一零六工厂工人庄康裕首先试验成功的。庄康裕设计制出的下料机上的电光安全制动器，就是在下料机右边装着光电管，左边装上照明灯，灯光对准光电管，下料时，如果工人不小心把手伸进机器，手就恰好把灯光挡住。这样，灯光照不到光电管，电流就会中断，机器没有电力马上就会停止下来，工人在操作时就完全不必担心轧伤手了。
    一零六工厂在下料机上装置电光安全制动器后，上海五金工会组织了许多五金、电机工厂职工去参观。今年七月，新安电机厂在冲床上装置电光安全制动器又获得成功。目前正在试验的还有三星拉练厂和永新电器厂。  （新华社）
    上海市建筑工人创造和改进了大批新工具和新工作法
    最近一年中，上海市建筑工人创造和改进了大批新工具和新工作法。这些新工具和新工作法中，有的提高工作效率三倍到五倍。如泥工用的全套改良粉墙器、锯瓦机、桩光灰机、自流式化灰工作法和木工用的拉边刨、绝头刨、长柄刨和刨料限度箱等。有的提高工作效率十倍到二十倍。如电动锯“M”形木板桩机和笋头车等。也有的提高工作效率百分之五十到一百的，如粉刷窗盘和粉刷明沟等新工具。这些新工具和新工作法在工地上应用后，为国家增产了大量财富。如全套改良粉墙器在两万户工人住宅工地推广使用后，就为国家节约了七十多亿元财富。又如电机锯“M”形木板桩机在二万户工人住宅工地使用后，不但比用斧头砍板桩节省了五千多个工作日，并且在锯四万根板桩中，节省了八万多板尺木材。
    上海市建筑工人所创造和改进的新工具和新工作法有两个特征：第一，大部分新工具和新工作法都帮助了在建筑工程中推行先进工作法。如黄永爱粉墙先进工作法在两万户工人住宅工地推广后，粉刷墙面效率提高三倍，但产生了来不及搭脚手架和灰浆供应不足等困难。工人们创造的自流式化灰操作法和活络木高凳成功后，就及时地解决了这些困难。第二，有些新工具已接近可以实行机械操作的程度。如技术员顾士明创造的锯瓦机和方金海创造的桩光灰机，只要按上动力设备，就可以成为一部很好的机器。  （新华社）
    重庆市国营和地方国营各工厂改进生产设备降低车间温度
    重庆市各国营和地方国营工厂积极改进生产设备，降低了车间温度，改善了职工劳动条件。国营二零一厂、二零二厂、二零六厂、重庆电工器材厂等四个机器厂，把产品不定型的二十个锻工炉周围加上隔热罩，把产品定型的两个锻工炉改造成为反射炉。这样就使炉子的热量集中在炉内，降低了车间的温度。二零二厂锻工场改装锻工炉以后，车间温度就由摄氏六十六度降低为四十八度。二七四九七厂锻工车间把红炉全部用耐火砖和普通砖砌封，只留炉门在外，上面开烟囱，使热量集中传到室外。这样不但降低了车间温度，而且减少了室内的灰尘。一零一钢铁厂第二场的红钢过去都是用人力运送到轧钢机，现在已经改为机器运送，使工人不再受高热红钢的熏烤，同时还减轻了工人的劳动强度。
    车间温度降低以后，高温车间工人因受热昏倒的现象已大大减少。病伤缺勤也显著降低。如一零一厂轧钢场五月份病伤缺勤平均每人一点一三个工，六月份就降低到零点八六个工。  （新华社）
    东北建立一个机械造林试验站
    东北行政委员会林业局为提前完成东北西部防护林带的营造计划，已在黑龙江开通县正式建立了我国第一个机械造林试验站，今年秋季就要开始试用机器垦荒造林。用机器造林比人工造林可深耕一倍以上，因而能提高树苗的成活率，并大大加快造林的速度。开通机械造林试验站现在已运到拖拉机、植树机、耕耘机各种机械和四铧犁、五铧犁、圆盘耙等耕作机器。目前，该站并开办了机械造林训练班，大力培养干部，第一期受训学员到十月中旬即可毕业。  （新华社）
    保证职工八小时睡眠的运动
    国营上海第七棉纺织厂工人家属六月底以来开展了保证职工八小时睡眠的运动。以便职工们能精神旺盛地从事生产。
    过去由于工人宿舍嘈杂、小孩闹，许多职工睡不好觉。在这一运动中，工人宿舍里四十二个家属小组订立了公约，规定家属要督促工人睡觉，不让他们做家务事；要带好孩子不吵闹，保证不大声吵嚷；不穿木拖鞋影响别人睡觉等。小组每周开会检查一次。工厂劳保福利科也积极帮助孩子多、房子小的工人解决困难，设办了夜工睡眠室，协助家属在宿舍里成立了托儿站，搭盖起一个很大的凉棚，供七岁以上的孩子乘凉游戏、阅读书画。儿童们也都组织起来，大孩子带领小孩子一起游戏，温功课，一起拍苍蝇做卫生工作。
    现在工人宿舍地区出现了新的气象。许多做夜班的职工门前插着写有“夜工”的小红旗，让大家注意不要在附近吵闹。宿舍周围的环境也安静得多了。郭金山的母亲是摇纱工，过去经常睡不足五小时，从未完成过生产计划，现在儿子不让她做家务，每天睡足八小时，生产情绪很高，七月份计划每天摇纱九十一车，现在已摇到九十七车。有一个女工往年夏天因睡眠不足身体支持不住常常请假，今年从未请过一次假，并表示要争取得红旗。八小时睡眠运动对降低缺勤起了作用。七月份天气炎热，该厂缺勤人数不但没有增加反比六月份降低。

    白菜在西藏地区生长起来了
    在拉萨河上游墨竹工卡的东头，在藏族噶东的一个小园子里，长着一小片嫩汪汪的包心白菜和黑白菜，过去，西藏地区没有生长过这两种蔬菜。这两种白菜的种子是中国人民解放军西藏军区某连模范通讯员朱德才给噶东的礼物。
        一九五零年人民解放军向西藏进军的时候，朱德才在沿途很少看到藏族农民们种植蔬菜。虽然也有人种一点白菜，可是这种白菜一般都长不大。朱德才给他母亲写了一封信，要她寄些菜蔬种子来。一九五一年，朱德才收到了他母亲的回信和包心白菜、黑白菜和河南甜瓜等种子。这些种子来到康藏高原可真不容易，它们经过了河南、湖北、四川和西康等省，转运了一万多里。朱德才到了墨竹工卡。今年春天播种的时候，他拿了些包心白菜和黑白菜的种子送给房东噶东，噶东很快就把它种在小园子里。幼苗出土了，他小心地培养着，时常浇水、拔草，白菜一天比一天旺盛的生长起来。当地的藏族人们，听说噶东种了祖国内地的白菜，时常来看白菜的生长情形。包心白菜和黑白菜确实是好品种，很快就长起来了，比同时种的当地白菜种长得大，吃起来味道也好。白菜刚刚抽条开花，就有人来向噶东要种子了。  （新华社）
