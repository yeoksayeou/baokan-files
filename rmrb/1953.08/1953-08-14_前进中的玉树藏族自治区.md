    The Advancing Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zhang Jian
    This summer, I visited the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region in southwestern Qinghai Province. This autonomous region is surrounded by the Kunlun Mountains, Bayan Har Mountains, and Tanggula Mountains, with the Tongtian River running through it. Over 100,000 Tibetan people nomadically live on this beautiful and rich grassland.
    Summer is the season of intense labor on the grasslands. Herdsmen have just finished tending to the newborn lambs and are happily harvesting wool. The yurts of various tribes have moved from the winter pastures to the cooler summer grazing lands. On the green grasslands, herds of cattle and sheep, having survived the winter, are greedily eating the new grass. The cattle and sheep are slowly growing fat. Women are busy milking cows and churning butter. Children are also grazing small cattle and sheep near the yurts. On the ancient post roads in the grasslands and mountains, convoys of yaks are continuously traveling to and from Xining, Xikang, Tibet, and other places. In this beautiful season, the herdsmen are working hard, sincerely grateful to Chairman Mao for bringing happiness and peace to the grasslands. They sing:
    Chairman Mao is like the sun,
    Shining on the beautiful grasslands,
    The cattle and sheep are fat,
    And the people are healthy.
    In the past, this was the time when Ma Bufang's bandit troops plundered the pastoral areas. In 1941 alone, more than 220,000 livestock of all kinds were stolen from the people of Yushu. Now, a large number of cadres sent by the People's Government are coming to various tribes to help herdsmen develop production. This summer, the Qinghai Provincial Animal Husbandry Department sent epidemic prevention teams to various tribes in the autonomous region to carry out animal disease prevention and control work; the three loan groups of the Autonomous Region People's Government went deep into the pastoral yurts to distribute 300 million in relief funds and 800 million in livestock loans; the five mobile trade groups of the state-owned trading company carried nearly 2,000 loads of tea and highland barley and other materials to various tribes for business.
    Since the establishment of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region in February 1952, all aspects have been developing vigorously. After the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government, the People's Governments of Chengduo and Nangqian counties were improved, and ten Xiaoga governments (equivalent to the district level) loved by the herdsmen have been established throughout the region after key pilot projects. The number of minority cadres participating in the work of the People's Government has reached 246, nearly four times more than in 1951. The positions of chairmen, county heads, section chiefs, and Xiaoga heads of the People's Governments at all levels in the autonomous region have mostly been held by minority cadres. Due to the hard work of minority cadres, the construction undertakings of the autonomous region have achieved great results. In the past three years, the number of livestock of all kinds in the region has increased year by year. In 1952, cattle and sheep increased by 11 percent compared with 1951. The medical equipment and medicines of the Autonomous Region People's Hospital have increased fourfold compared with 1951, and two more medical clinics have been added in Chengduo and Nangqian counties. The number of students in Yushu Complete Primary School has increased compared with 1951, and the teaching content is mainly in Tibetan. Two new primary schools have also been established in Chengduo and Nangqian counties. In order to develop Tibetan cultural education, the Autonomous Region has newly established a Tibetan printing factory. The state-owned trading company has increased its supply and purchase by more than three times compared with before the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government.
    With the development of economy and culture and the gradual improvement of people's lives, especially after the smooth flow of materials with Xikang and Tibet, Jegu City, the capital of the autonomous region, has quickly prospered. Last year, 1 million catties of tea were transported from Xikang; and 30,000 yaks were successively used to transport goods to Tibet. This year, a large number of pulu and decorations loved by Tibetan women were transported from Tibet, and 200,000 catties of highland barley were transported from Xining. The urban area of Jegu City has expanded half a li to the west, adding many houses and shops. The construction projects of the Autonomous Region People's Government and the local committees of the Communist Party of China are under intense construction. Now, the local products and special products of various tribes are being successively concentrated in Jegu City. Monks and lay people on the street are constantly flowing. The newly built seven large business departments of the state-owned trading company are crowded with people all day long.

    前进中的玉树藏族自治区
    新华社记者  张坚
    今年夏天，记者访问了青海省西南部的玉树藏族自治区。这个自治区，四面被昆仑山、巴颜喀喇山和唐古喇山环绕，通天河横贯其中。十万多藏族人民，游牧在这一块美丽而富饶的草原上。
    夏季，是草原上紧张劳动的季节。牧民刚接罢羊羔，又在愉快地收获羊毛。各部落的帐房，已从冬季牧场搬入凉爽的夏季牧地。在碧绿的草原上，渡过了寒冬的成群的牛羊，贪婪地吃着新生的绿草。牛羊慢慢地肥壮起来了。妇女们在忙着挤牛奶打酥油。孩子们也在帐房附近放牧着小牛、小羊。在草原和山峦中的古代驿道上，成群的牦牛运输队，络绎不绝地来往在西宁、西康、西藏等地。在这美好的季节里，牧民紧张的劳动着，衷心感激毛主席给草原上带来了幸福和安宁。他们歌唱着：
    毛主席像太阳，
    照在美丽的草原上，
    牛羊肥壮了，
    人儿也健康。
    过去，这时正是马步芳匪军抢掠牧区的时候。仅在一九四一年，玉树全区人民被抢去的各种牲畜就有二十二万多头。现在，人民政府派出的大批干部，正来到各个部落，帮助牧民发展生产。今年夏天，青海省人民政府畜牧厅派出防疫队，到自治区各部落进行兽疫防治工作；自治区人民政府的三个贷款小组，深入到牧区帐房发放三亿救济款和八亿畜牧贷款；国营贸易公司的五个流动贸易小组，驮着近两千驮茶和青稞等物资，到各部落作生意。
    玉树藏族自治区自一九五二年二月成立以来，各方面都在蓬勃的发展着。自治区人民政府成立后，健全了称多、囊谦两个县人民政府，并在全区经过重点试办已经成立了十个牧民们爱戴的消尕政府（相当区级）。参加人民政府工作的少数民族干部已有二百四十六名，比一九五一年增加了将近四倍。自治区各级人民政府的主席、县长、科长和消尕长等职务，大都已由少数民族干部担任。由于少数民族干部努力工作，使自治区各项建设事业获得很大成绩。三年来，全区各种牲畜逐年增加。一九五二年牛羊比一九五一年增殖了百分之十一。自治区人民医院的医疗设备和药品比一九五一年增加了四倍，在称多、囊谦两县增设了两所医疗所。玉树完全小学的学生，比一九五一年有了增加，教课内容以藏文为主，称多、囊谦两县还新设了两所初级小学。为了发展藏族文化教育，自治区新建立了一所藏文印刷厂。国营贸易公司，在供应和收购方面，都比自治区人民政府成立前增加了三倍以上。
    随着经济文化的发展和人民生活的逐渐提高，特别是与西康、西藏两地物资畅通以后，自治区首府结古市就很快繁荣起来。去年由西康运进的茶叶有一百万斤；到西藏运货的牦牛先后达三万头。今年，由西藏运进大批氆氇和藏族妇女喜爱的装饰品，由西宁运进二十万斤青稞。结古市市区向西扩展了半里路，增添了不少房舍和商店。自治区人民政府和中共地方委员会等机关的修建工程，正在紧张地施工中。现在，各部落的土产、特产品正陆续集中结古市，街上来往的僧俗人民川流不息，国营贸易公司新修建的七间宽大的门市部前，整日拥挤着人群。
