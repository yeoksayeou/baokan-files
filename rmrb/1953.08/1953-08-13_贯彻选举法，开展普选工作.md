    Implement the Electoral Law and Carry Out Universal Suffrage
    More Than 560 Townships in East China Complete Pilot Projects for Universal Suffrage
    Since the beginning of May, provinces in the East China region have successively selected 521 townships and 44 small towns to conduct pilot projects for grassroots elections; by the end of July, this work had been largely completed.
    People in the pilot areas for universal suffrage enthusiastically participated in various election activities with high political zeal. During the population census and voter registration, the broad masses actively participated, with some voluntarily requesting to assist staff in registration work. Voters repeatedly reviewed voter qualifications with a responsible attitude, and repeatedly deliberated and selected the representatives they were satisfied with and needed. After the list of 56 candidates in Peijiaying Township, Licheng County, Shandong Province, was determined, each voter group spent two or three nights repeatedly discussing the candidates in their electoral district. Some candidates had shortcomings in their work, and after being strictly criticized by the voters, they all made profound self-criticisms. Voters said: As long as cadres can recognize the shortcomings in their work and correct them, they are still good cadres.
    When the pilot areas for universal suffrage held election meetings, voters enthusiastically participated and conscientiously exercised their democratic rights. In Chongfu Township, Longxi County, Fujian Province, many farmers voluntarily brought out folk instruments such as flutes, xiao, stringed instruments, gongs, and drums, and played folk songs to celebrate the great election day. Some voters wore beautiful clothes as if it were a festival. In Hushu Town, Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, many Hui voters wore "prayer caps," and women put on new clothes and flowers to participate in the election. In Bujiapeng Township, Shouchang County, Zhejiang Province, more than 50 voters who were working elsewhere or had returned to their parents' home rushed back to their hometown to participate in the election on election day. According to statistics from the completed pilot townships and towns, the number of voters participating in the election averaged around 90 percent. In Zhejiang Province, the proportion of voters participating in the vote in 127 pilot townships for universal suffrage reached 88.7 percent; 73 townships reached more than 90 percent.
    New atmospheres have emerged in the areas that have undergone universal suffrage. The unity of the people's representatives and the broad masses has made the relationship between the people's government and the masses closer. After the universal suffrage in Hushu Town, Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, the work style of many cadres has undergone significant changes. Township cadre Qiao Jiayan actively led the masses in flood prevention and dike rescue, persisting on the dike for two days and two nights, which the masses were very satisfied with. After the People's Congress of Mafu Township, Jianyang County, Fujian Province, representatives took the lead in guiding the masses in activities such as rational fertilization, irrigation, weeding, and pest control. The production enthusiasm of farmers throughout the township is extremely high, and they have all expressed their desire to work hard in production to welcome the first harvest year after universal suffrage.
    The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Holds a Symposium on Universal Suffrage Propaganda Work
    In order to strengthen the propaganda work of grassroots elections in various parts of the Northeast, the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC recently held a symposium on universal suffrage propaganda work.
    According to the reflections at the symposium, the Northeast region conducted extensive propaganda and education work among the people during the pilot process of grassroots elections, which achieved good results. However, some places have not closely integrated production to carry out the propaganda work of universal suffrage. Therefore, the meeting unanimously believed that it is necessary to strengthen the propaganda work in universal suffrage.
    The meeting believed that the universal suffrage work team is the main force of propaganda. In addition to leading them in propaganda work, the party's propaganda department should, more importantly, rely on and help the local party branch to lead propagandists and activists who have emerged in the movement to do a good job in propaganda work. Regarding the issue of closely combining universal suffrage propaganda with production, the meeting believed that this not only requires that universal suffrage propaganda work does not delay production, but also that universal suffrage propaganda improves the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the masses, so that universal suffrage truly becomes a driving force for promoting production.
    The meeting pointed out in the summary that in order to widely carry out universal suffrage propaganda work, the propaganda department must provide a large number of literary and artistic propaganda materials with correct content, and conduct extensive propaganda in a vivid, specific, and easy-to-understand manner. In the summary, specific requirements were also put forward for the specific propaganda content and methods of each stage of the universal suffrage work. In addition, the meeting also conducted a detailed discussion on how to consolidate and improve the propaganda network in the universal suffrage movement.
    Shenyang Municipal People's Representatives Conference Discusses Launching Citywide Grassroots Elections
    Shenyang City held its third session of the third People's Representatives Conference on the 8th, reviewed and approved the grassroots election work plan for each district, and mobilized the people of the city to actively participate in the election. More than 2,000 people attended the meeting, including representatives from all sectors of the city and districts, and responsible cadres from various factories, institutions, and schools. The meeting unanimously approved the plan to fully launch grassroots election work in the city, and passed a resolution on doing a good job in the city's grassroots election work.
    Sun Liyu, Deputy Mayor of Shenyang and Secretary-General of the Municipal Election Committee, delivered a report on launching grassroots election work throughout the city. He pointed out that for the past two months, the Shenyang Municipal Election Committee has made full preparations for launching grassroots elections throughout the city. Since the establishment of the city and district election committees, they have successively trained more than 4,600 universal suffrage work cadres; conducted extensive universal suffrage propaganda to the people of the city; and conducted pilot work in two streets, one factory, and one district. Through these pilot works, preliminary experience in conducting universal suffrage in the city has been obtained. The grassroots election work plan for each district in the city formulated this time is based on the experience gained in the pilot work. This plan stipulates that in order to facilitate production and work, the city's grassroots election work will be carried out in two steps. The first step is from August 10th to September 10th to complete the population census and voter registration; then, one month will be used to review voter qualifications and seriously discuss the nomination of candidates. From the beginning of October to the middle of October, the city will complete all grassroots election work. The suburbs will complete the population census and voter registration during the weeding period in September; and complete the grassroots election work after the autumn harvest.
    At the meeting, Zhou Dafu, a representative of various democratic parties in Shenyang, Zhu Weiren, a representative of various people's organizations, and Ma Shifen, a representative of various ethnic minorities, spoke successively. They unanimously agreed with Sun Liyu's report on launching grassroots election work throughout the city, and expressed that they would lead people from all walks of life to take active action to ensure the smooth completion of the city's grassroots election work.
    Yupu and Jinlan Townships in the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous Region of Guangxi Province Successfully Complete Universal Suffrage
    The people of all ethnic groups in Yupu and Jinlan Townships in the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous Region of Guangxi Province have successfully elected representatives to the first People's Congress of the township.
    On July 28th and 29th, grand election meetings were held in each electoral district of the two townships. The voters who participated in the meeting were as if they were celebrating a festival, and they ate breakfast and rushed to the venue before dawn. Miao girls wore new clothes with lace. People of all ethnic groups cherished their right to vote, and more than 95 percent of the voters in the two townships participated in the election.
    In the election, the spirit of unity and equality among all ethnic groups was demonstrated. Before the election, voters of all ethnic groups, after a month of democratic consultation, deliberation, and discussion, carefully put forward a list of candidates, so the elected representatives were all figures supported by the broad masses and had broad representativeness. Among the 38 representatives elected in the two townships, there were eight female representatives. There is Jia Rugui, the current township chief of Yupu Township who has always been active in his work and can connect with the masses, and Dong Ronglin (Miao), a model of hygiene in Guangxi Province, etc. After the election was completed, people of all ethnic groups blew lusheng and danced, celebrating the victory of the election with extremely happy hearts.
    People of All Ethnic Groups in Nongchang Township, Shimian County, Xikang Province Enthusiastically Participate in Universal Suffrage
    In Nongchang Township, Shimian County, Xikang Province, where Han and Tibetan people live together, people of all ethnic groups enthusiastically participated in universal suffrage and held an election meeting on July 30th, electing people's representatives. On the day of the election meeting, before the morning mist on the Dadu River rose, teams of people poured into the venue from the riverbank and valley. The voters of Guangyuan Village set off before dawn, but more than 50 Tibetan voters in Nongchang Village entered the venue even earlier than them. After the election meeting began, the venue was in good order, and no voter left the seat halfway. As a result of the election, 60 outstanding members of the Han and Tibetan peoples were elected as representatives. For example, Yang Guoxuan actively led the people of the township in production and cared about the people's lives during his tenure as township chief. This time, the two peoples elected him as a people's representative. Tibetan woman Wu Guifang is the chairman of the township women's representative meeting. For the past three years, she has consistently and actively promoted the government's various policies, took the lead in completing production tasks, and helped women overcome difficulties in production and life, and was loved by the people.
    Before liberation, people of all ethnic groups in Nongchang Township lived a poor life, and more than half of them lived on "wild food." Now, in Nongchang Village, hundreds of new houses such as banks, shops, and cultural centers have appeared on the formerly overgrown streets, and people's lives have also improved. When the universal suffrage work began, Han and Tibetan people actively participated. Farmer Wang Yufang expressed the feelings of the people throughout the township: "We must elect good people's representatives to be masters of our own affairs and live a better life."

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    华东区五百六十多个乡、镇完成普选典型试办工作
    华东区各省从五月初起，先后选择了五百二十一个乡、四十四个小城镇，进行基层选举试办工作；到七月底止，这一工作已大体完成。
    各普选试办地区人民都以高度的政治积极性热烈参加各项选举活动。在人口调查和选民登记时，广大群众都积极参加，有的自动要求协助工作人员做登记工作。选民们以认真负责的态度反复审查选民资格，并反复地酝酿、挑选自己所满意的和必要的人当代表。山东历城县裴家营乡的五十六名候选人名单确定后，各选民小组用了两三个晚上的时间，反复讨论本选区的候选人。有些候选人在工作中有些缺点，经选民严格地批评后，他们都作了深刻的检讨。选民们说：只要干部能认识工作中的缺点，改正缺点，还是好干部。
    各普选试办地区举行选举大会时，选民们都踊跃参加，认真地行使了自己的民主权利。福建省龙溪县崇福乡许多农民自动地搬出笛、箫、弦琴、锣、鼓等乐器，吹奏着民间歌曲，来庆祝伟大的选举日。有些选民像过节一样穿起漂亮的衣服。江苏省江宁县湖熟镇，许多回族选民戴上了“礼拜帽”，妇女们穿上新衣，插上鲜花去参加选举。浙江寿昌县卜家蓬乡，有五十多个外出做工或回娘家的选民，在选举日都赶回乡来参加选举。据已完成的试办乡、镇的统计，选民参加选举的人数平均都在百分之九十左右。浙江省一百二十七个普选试办乡参加投票的选民比例达到百分之八十八点七；有七十三个乡达到百分之九十以上。
    经过普选的地区都出现了新的气象。人民代表和广大群众的团结一致，使人民政府和群众的关系更加密切。江苏省江宁县湖熟镇普选后，很多干部的工作作风都有了显著的转变。乡干部乔家燕积极领导群众防汛抢救圩堤，在堤上坚持两天两夜，群众非常满意。福建省建阳县马伏乡乡人民代表大会结束后，代表们带头领导群众进行合理施肥、灌溉、锄草、治虫等活动。全乡农民生产情绪极高，都表示要努力生产迎接普选后的第一个丰收年。
    中共中央东北局宣传部召开普选宣传工作座谈会
    为加强东北各地基层选举的宣传工作，中共中央东北局宣传部在最近召开了普选宣传工作座谈会。
    根据座谈会上的反映，东北各地在基层选举典型试办过程中，曾向人民群众进行了广泛的宣传教育工作，收到了良好的效果。但是，也有一些地方还没有密切结合生产把普选的宣传工作开展起来。因此，会议一致认为：必须加强普选中的宣传工作。
    会议认为普选工作队是宣传的主要力量。党的宣传部门除应领导他们进行宣传工作外，更重要的是使他们依靠和帮助当地的党支部领导宣传员以及在运动中涌现出来的积极分子做好宣传工作。关于普选宣传与生产密切结合的问题，会议认为：这不仅要求普选宣传工作不耽误生产，而且要通过普选宣传提高群众的政治觉悟和生产积极性，使普选真正成为推进生产的动力。
    会议在总结中指出，为广泛展开普选宣传工作，宣传部门必须供给大批内容正确的文艺宣传材料，用生动、具体、通俗易懂的方式进行广泛宣传。总结中，对普选工作各个阶段的具体宣传内容和方法，也提出了具体的要求。此外，会议对如何在普选运动中巩固与提高宣传网的问题，也进行了详细的讨论。
    沈阳市各界人民代表会议讨论开展全市基层选举工作
    沈阳市在八日召开第三届第三次各界人民代表会议，审查和批准了各区基层选举工作计划，动员全市人民积极参加选举。参加会议的有市、区各界人民代表和各工厂、机关、学校的负责干部共两千余人。会议一致通过了在全市全面展开基层选举工作的计划，并通过了做好全市基层选举工作的决议。
    沈阳市人民政府副市长、市选举委员会秘书长孙力馀在会上作了关于全市开展基层选举工作的报告。他指出：两个月来，沈阳市选举委员会为开展全市的基层选举已作了充分的准备。全市和各区选举委员会成立以来，先后训练了四千六百多名普选工作干部；向全市人民作了广泛的普选宣传；在两个街道、一个工厂和一个区内进行了典型试办工作。通过这些典型试办工作，已初步取得了在城市中进行普选工作的经验。这次制订的市内各区基层选举工作计划就是根据典型试办中取得的经验而拟定的。这个计划规定：为了便利生产和工作，全市基层选举工作将分两个步骤进行。首先是自八月十日开始到九月十日以前，完成人口调查和选民登记；然后以一个月的时间进行选民资格审查和认真讨论候选人的提名。从十月初到十月中旬全市全部完成基层选举工作。郊区在九月挂锄期间完成人口调查和选民登记；秋收后完成基层选举工作。
    在会议上，沈阳市各民主党派代表周达夫、各人民团体代表朱维仁、各少数民族代表马世芬等相继讲话。他们一致同意孙力馀关于在全市开展基层选举工作的报告，并表示要带领各阶层人民积极行动起来，为保证顺利完成全市的基层选举工作而努力。
    广西省大苗山苗族自治区雨蒲、金蓝两乡顺利完成普选
    广西省大苗山苗族自治区雨蒲、金蓝两乡各族人民已顺利地选出了乡首届人民代表大会代表。
    七月二十八、九两日，两乡各选区分别举行了盛大的选举大会。参加大会的选民都像过节日一样，天还没亮就吃过饭赶到会场。苗族姑娘们穿着镶花边的新衣。各族人民都珍重自己的选举权利，两乡有百分之九十五以上的选民参加了选举。
    在选举中，表现了各民族的团结和平等精神。在选举以前，各族选民经过一个月的民主协商、酝酿讨论，慎重提出候选人名单，因而所选出的代表都是为广大群众所拥护的人物，具有广泛的代表性。两乡当选的三十八个代表中，有妇女代表八名。有一向工作积极能联系群众的雨蒲乡现任乡长贾儒归，有广西省卫生模范董荣林（苗族）等。选举完成后，各族人民吹芦笙、跳舞，用极愉快的心情来庆祝选举的胜利。
    西康省石棉县农场乡各族人民热烈参加普选
    西康省石棉县汉族和藏族杂居的农场乡，各族人民热烈参加普选，已在七月三十日举行了选举大会，选出人民代表。开选举大会那天，大渡河上的朝雾还未升起，一队队的人流就从河畔、山谷涌向会场。广元村的选民天不亮就出发，但农场村五十多个藏族选民却比他们更先进入了会场。选举大会开始后，会场秩序井然，没有一个选民中途离席。选举结果，汉族与藏族人民中六十个优秀分子当选为代表，例如杨国轩在任乡长期内积极领导全乡人民生产，关心人民生活，这次两族人民都选他为人民代表，藏族妇女吴桂芳是乡妇女代表会主席，三年来，一贯积极宣传政府的各项政策，带头完成生产任务，帮助妇女克服生产和生活中的困难，受到人民爱戴。
    农场乡各族人民在解放前过着穷困的生活，有一半以上的人靠“野粮”度日。现在在农场村原来荒草丛生的街上已出现了银行、商店、文化馆等上百幢新屋，人民的生活也得到改善。普选工作开始时，汉族、藏族人民都积极参加。农民王玉芳说出了全乡人民心里的话：“要选好人民代表当家作主，过更好的日子。”    （新华社）
