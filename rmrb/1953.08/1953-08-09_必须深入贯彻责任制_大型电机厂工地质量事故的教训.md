    The Responsibility System Must Be Implemented in Depth
    ——The Lesson of Quality Accidents at the Large Electric Motor Factory Construction Site
    After uncovering waste and a lack of accountability, the large electric motor factory construction site of the First Engineering Company of the Central Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration formulated administrative responsibility systems, technical supply responsibility systems, and technical quality responsibility systems. In particular, the formulation of the technical quality responsibility system organized all aspects of construction technology through regulations—everything had someone in charge, and everyone had a specific responsibility, laying the foundation for strengthening technical management. While establishing the technical quality responsibility system, the construction site organized workers to study operating procedures and quality standards, and workers and teams were assigned quality responsibilities; the drawings were reviewed in detail, and many errors were found; the inspectors were also conscientious and corrected errors in the layout. Under these circumstances, the quality of the first phase of the project was guaranteed. Facts have proven that once the responsibility system is established and implemented, it will produce great results.
    However, after the work of establishing the technical quality responsibility system at the construction site came to an end and the focus shifted to strengthening planning management, a quality accident occurred in the second phase of the reinforced concrete column project. Among the fifty-six concrete columns, thirty-two had problems such as pitting and honeycombing. In the areas with honeycombing, the aggregate was dense with no mortar, and the stones would fall off with a light tap of a small hammer, with a maximum depth of 13.5 centimeters. The most serious problems occurred in five columns, all in important areas—the stress-bearing part under the cantilever beam (i.e., the "middle leg"), where the upper part of one column needed to be re-poured, and the remaining columns needed to be filled with concrete. Because these problems were discovered after removing the formwork, all areas requiring rework had to have the originally poured concrete chiseled away, and the formwork had to be re-supported for re-pouring. This not only wasted labor and materials but also delayed the construction period, affecting the progress of the next phase of bricklaying.
    The direct cause of the quality accident in the second phase of the project at the construction site was the failure to continue implementing the responsibility system in depth. This is reflected in the following aspects: First, Article 1 of the Chief Engineer Responsibility System stipulates that the Chief Engineer should "explain the main key structures and construction measures to the responsible engineers, responsible construction technicians, and construction technicians five days before the start of the sub-project"; Article 4 also stipulates that the Chief Engineer should be responsible for "handling major technical problems that occur temporarily and guiding construction." However, before the construction of the concrete columns in the second phase of the project, the Chief Engineer of the construction site did not study well what measures to take for the key structure—the densely reinforced area under the cantilever beam, and did not clearly stipulate it; when problems occurred during construction, the construction technician reported to the Chief Engineer, but he did not go deep into the site to study and deal with them, leaving major technical problems in a state of no one being responsible. Second, vibrators were used to compact the North Row columns. Because vibrators were being used for the first time, operating procedures should have been formulated before construction, explained to the workers, and organized for study, but they did not do so, and only tested them on sand when they were temporarily used. Although the inspection team leader was present at the time, he only explained it to the workers, but some workers did not hear it. Due to the workers' unfamiliarity with the operation, some areas were not compacted well and problems occurred. Third, some workers violated operating procedures during the construction of the North Row concrete columns. For example, the mortar carriers did not follow instructions, and the mortar was carried for too long and had already solidified but was not carried back for re-mixing; and some compaction workers were irresponsible and poured dry mortar into the formwork, which also seriously affected the quality of the project. Fourth, although the technical inspection responsibility system at the construction site was implemented relatively well, it failed to adhere to principles when encountering critical points. For example, when pouring the South Row columns, even the inspection team leader was not sure, but he did not insist on raising opinions to the Chief Engineer and studying appropriate measures.
    The quality accident at the large electric motor factory construction site proves that after the responsibility system is established, it must be implemented in depth with leadership, organization, and planning; only then can the phenomenon of no one being responsible be truly overcome.
    Based on the lessons of the large electric motor factory, how can the responsibility system be implemented?
    First, we must oppose the blind optimism of leading cadres. After the completion of the first phase of the project at the large electric motor factory construction site, the leading cadres of the construction site did not summarize the work and check the implementation of the responsibility system, blindly believing that "the quality of the first phase of the project was good, and the quality of the second phase will not be a problem." Therefore, they did not study the next phase of the project task and urge the continued implementation of the responsibility system. Of course, the experience of the first phase of the project is helpful for the second phase, but it is wrong to be satisfied only with the experience of the first phase. First of all, the first phase of the foundation project was technically relatively simple, and at the beginning of the establishment of the technical quality responsibility system, both leading cadres and the masses paid attention to quality. Secondly, although some responsibility systems were initially formulated in the first phase of construction, technical management had not yet been systematically organized. Thirdly, some of the initially implemented systems were not yet sound and consolidated. For example, after the concrete strength test work began, six blocks were damaged and no one was responsible, and the test results were not notified to the construction team in time, so the construction technician did not know what the concrete strength was; also, two of the more than ten test blocks failed, and it was not clear whether there was a problem with the water-cement ratio or the protection work was not done well. Therefore, in the second phase of the project, the leaders of the construction site should understand and analyze the implementation of the responsibility system in the previous phase of construction, understand which systems were implemented well and should be consolidated, and which systems were not implemented and what the reasons were. Then, they should determine the plan and method for implementing the responsibility system in depth based on the next step of work and urge its implementation. However, the leading cadres of the large electric motor factory construction site did not do this. They were blindly optimistic, complacent, and careless, resulting in the failure to implement the responsibility system and the work suffering disaster.
    Second, to implement the responsibility system in depth, it is also necessary to correctly organize the implementation of these systems after they are established. That is, to rely on and organize engineering and technical personnel, give play to their enthusiasm, and ensure the implementation of the systems. It should be understood that the establishment and implementation of the responsibility system is a major reform in construction enterprises. For engineering and technical personnel and all employees, it is a new task, and it is necessary to constantly fight against old habits, old ideas, and old styles. Therefore, the leaders of the construction site must be good at helping and urging them to regularly check their work, assist them in overcoming obstacles in their work, strengthen the unity between technical personnel, between technical personnel and workers, and correct the bad ideological styles of technical personnel. Although the leading comrades of the large electric motor factory construction site generally paid attention to this work, they did not do it regularly or in depth, so some quality accidents in the second phase of the project were still caused by technical personnel not following the system.
    Third, it is necessary to rely on the workers, absorb their wisdom, and enrich the content of the responsibility system. The formwork design of the columns at the large electric motor factory construction site was inappropriate. Before supporting the formwork, the concrete workers made a reasonable suggestion to the leading cadres of the construction site: the two large surfaces of the columns should be supported with vertical boards, and the two small surfaces should be nailed with horizontal boards, and the boards should be nailed as the concrete is poured. In this way, the workers can see the concrete and it is easy to compact. However, the leading side of the construction site did not study and adopt this reasonable suggestion. Before pouring the concrete, the Party branch of the construction site accepted the suggestions of the masses and held a technical research meeting, at which the masses proposed a method to overcome the difficulty of compaction by opening holes in the vertical boards, and a decision was made at the meeting. However, the leading cadres of the construction site did not pay attention to this suggestion and urge its implementation, which affected the quality of the project. Facts have proven that the working masses have rich practical knowledge, and the leading cadres of the construction site must absorb the experience and wisdom of the workers in order to continuously enrich the content of the system and ensure its thorough implementation. However, the leading cadres of the large electric motor factory construction site did not study the characteristics of the project well, did not understand that whether the formwork design was appropriate or not had a serious impact on the quality of the project, and blindly believed that since there were no problems in the first phase of the project, they did not pay attention to the reasonable suggestions of the masses to continuously improve their work.
    Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen political work and conduct frequent education on the importance of quality. At the beginning of the establishment of the technical quality responsibility system at the large electric motor factory construction site, extensive education on the importance of quality was carried out among the masses, which had a great effect. However, when pouring the North Side columns in the second phase of the project, because the concrete worker team was not united and individual workers were emotional, they poured dry mortar into the formwork, and the compaction work was not carried out carefully. This proves that the idea of the masses attaching importance to quality cannot be established through one movement. However, to do a good job of political education, the cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League must unite under the principle of facing production. When the cause of the quality accident at the construction site was investigated, it was revealed that the cadres of the Party, administration, and trade union did not hold a meeting to study the project task and how to strengthen political work before the construction of the second phase of the project. No one knew what anyone was doing during the construction, leaving the work of quality education in a state of no one being responsible. Therefore, to implement the responsibility system in depth, the cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League must unite and carry out frequent political education work around the project task.
    Fifth, the implementation of the technical quality responsibility system is a regular task, and the complexity and variability of basic construction construction are also important. 1. The construction objects are constantly changing: for example, a concrete worker team may pour foundations yesterday, pour columns today, and may go to pour prefabricated roof panels tomorrow. As the work objects are different, the operating methods and quality requirements change accordingly; 2. Open-air construction is affected by natural conditions—wind, rain, cold, heat, and work locations. For example, the humidity of the column formwork at the large factory construction site was relatively high, and the moisture evaporated quickly due to the hot weather. After the wood boards contracted, the distance between the formwork and the steel bars was reduced, and the compaction rods could not be inserted, which affected the quality of the project; 3. Various types of work are combined with each other but also have contradictions. For example, when the concrete columns were poured at the large electric motor factory construction site, the carpenters did not open the holes as required, and the scaffolding erected by the scaffolders was not suitable, which affected the compaction work of the concrete workers; even in the concrete worker team, if any work such as mixing, transporting ash, compacting, and curing goes wrong, it will affect the quality of the project; 4. The quality of the project is also affected by the progress. Experience has repeatedly proven that quality is easily overlooked when the construction period is tight. For example, some concrete columns at the large electric motor factory construction site had their cantilever beams poured for only three days, and the formwork was removed in violation of regulations because they were eager to lay bricks. Because the concrete had not yet solidified, one corner was damaged; 5. At present, most construction is done manually, but the technical level of the workers is not high and uneven, and their ideological understanding is not consistent. Problems will occur at any time if there is a slight negligence in organization and ideological education. To expand the scope, basic construction construction is also affected by the design, technical supply, and the technical level and ideological style of technical personnel. All of this shows that technical management is very complex and changeable. This stipulates that the implementation of the technical quality responsibility system is a regular and meticulous task. Therefore, to ensure the in-depth implementation of the responsibility system, it is also necessary to stipulate a system for regularly checking the implementation of the responsibility system, and to solve problems at any time to prevent any loopholes from occurring.
    After the quality accident occurred at the large electric motor factory construction site, the First Engineering Company conducted a major quality inspection, checked the implementation of the technical quality responsibility system, and found that out of 127 responsibility systems, only 27 were implemented, 79 were not fully implemented, 18 were not implemented, and 3 were not implemented because the project had not yet been constructed. Through the inspection, not only did the leading cadres get to the bottom of the situation, but they also specifically criticized the blind optimism and greatly educated the leading cadres and the masses. Now, the construction site has continued to promote the implementation of the responsibility system one step further with major projects as the focus, and has established four systems for regularly checking the implementation of the responsibility system. Along with this, a new atmosphere of attaching importance to quality has reappeared. However, it should be pointed out that the measures taken by the large electric motor factory construction site are already one step late. Other units should learn from this lesson and implement the responsibility system in depth with leadership, organization, and planning before accidents occur.
    The quality accident at the large electric motor factory construction site tells us that the establishment of the responsibility system is relatively easy, but the implementation of the responsibility system is still an arduous task. Only by conducting it with leadership, organization, and planning can we promote the continuous and in-depth implementation of the responsibility system; and only in the in-depth implementation of the technical quality responsibility system can we guarantee project quality and gradually improve the level of technical management.

    必须深入贯彻责任制
    ——大型电机厂工地质量事故的教训
    中央有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司大型电机厂工地，在揭发浪费与无人负责现象之后，制订了行政责任制、技术供应责任制及技术质量责任制等制度。特别是技术质量责任制的制订，用制度把施工技术上的各个环节组织起来——事事有人管，人人有专责，为加强技术管理打下了基础。该工地在建立技术质量责任制的同时，组织工人学习了操作规程和质量标准，工人、小组都确定了质量责任；详细审查了图纸，发现了不少错误；检查人员也认真负责，纠正了放线中的错误。在这种情况之下，第一期工程质量得到了保证。事实证明，责任制一经建立与执行，就会产生很大的效果。
    但是，该工地在建立技术质量责任制的工作告一段落，中心工作转到加强计划管理之后，第二期钢筋混凝土柱子工程发生了质量事故。在五十六根混凝土柱子中有三十二根柱子发生麻面、蜂窝毛病。有蜂窝毛病的地方，石子密集无浆，用小锤子一敲石子就脱落下来，深度最大为十三点五公分。最严重的有五根柱子，毛病都发生在重要部分——悬壁梁（即“中腿”）下部受压力的地方，其中一根柱子的上部需要重新浇灌，其余柱子要用混凝土填补。由于这些毛病是在拆模型板后才发现的，所有需要返工的地方都要把原来浇灌的混凝土凿掉，再把模型板支起来重新浇灌。这不但浪费人工和材料，而且拖延了工期，影响下一期砌砖工程的进行。
    该工地第二期工程发生质量事故的直接原因，是由于责任制度没有继续深入贯彻下去。这表现在以下几个方面：一、主任工程师责任制第一条规定：主任工程师应“于分部工程开工前五天，将主要关键结构及施工措施向专责工程师、专责施工员及施工员进行交代”；又在第四条规定：主任工程师应负责“处理临时发生的重大技术问题，并指导施工”。但是，在第二期工程混凝土柱子施工前，该工地主任工程师并没有很好地研究，对于关键结构——悬壁梁下部钢筋密集的地方采取什么措施，更没有明确规定；在施工中发生问题，施工员曾向主任工程师报告，但他也没有深入现场研究处理，使重大技术问题处于无人负责的状态之中。二、该工地浇灌北排柱子时，是使用震动器捣固的。由于震动器是初次使用，按规定在施工前应制订操作规程，向工人交代并组织学习，但他们没有这样做，临时用时才在砂子上试验了一下。当时虽然有检查组长在场，由他向工人讲了一下，但有些工人还没有听见。由于工人操作不熟练，有些地方就因捣固不好出了毛病。三、在北排混凝土柱子施工中，有些工人违反操作规程。如担浆工人不听指挥，灰浆担来过久已经凝固而不担回重新搅拌；又有个别捣固工人不负责任，就把干浆倒入模型板之中，因而也严重地影响了工程质量。四、该工地技术检查责任制虽然贯彻较好，但遇到关键之处也未能坚持原则。如浇灌南排柱子时，连检查组长也没有把握，可是他没有坚持向主任工程师提出意见，研究妥善措施。
    大型电机厂工地质量事故证明，在责任制建立之后，必须有领导、有组织、有计划地深入贯彻下去；才能真正克服无人负责的现象。
    根据大型电机厂的教训，怎样才能贯彻责任制呢？
    首先必须反对领导干部的盲目乐观情绪。大型电机厂工地第一期工程结束后，工地领导干部没有总结工作，检查责任制贯彻情况，盲目地认为“第一期工程质量不错，第二期质量不会出问题”，因此没有研究下一期工程任务，督促责任制继续贯彻下去。当然，第一期工程的经验对第二期工程是有帮助的，但是仅仅满足第一期工程的经验，则是错误的。首先因为第一期基础工程是技术上比较简单的，而且当时建立技术质量责任制之初，从领导干部到群众都注意质量。其次，在第一期施工中，虽然开始制定了某些责任制度，但也还没有系统地把技术管理起来。第三，某些初步贯彻了的制度，也还不够健全与巩固。如混凝土强度试验工作开始以后，有六块碰坏了无人负责，试块结果也未能及时通知施工组，施工员不知道混凝土强度究竟如何；又在十几个试块中有两块不及格，弄不清是水灰配合比有问题还是保护工作没做好。因此，在第二期工程中，工地领导者应该对上一期工程施工中贯彻责任制的情况加以了解与分析，了解那些制度贯彻得好，应该巩固下去，那些制度没有贯彻，原因何在？然后针对下一步的工作确定深入贯彻责任制的计划与办法，督促执行。可是大型电机厂工地领导干部没有这样作，他们盲目乐观、麻痹大意，结果责任制没有贯彻，工作遭受祸害。
    第二，要深入贯彻责任制，还必须在制度建立以后，正确地组织执行这些制度。也就是要依靠与组织工程技术人员，发挥他们的积极性，保证制度的贯彻。应该了解，建立与执行责任制在施工企业中是一项重大的改革，对于工程技术人员和全体职工来说，都是一件新的工作，必须向旧的习惯、旧的思想与作风作经常的斗争。因此工地的领导者必须善于帮助与督促他们经常检查工作，协助他们克服工作中的阻碍，加强技术人员与技术人员之间、技术人员与工人之间的团结，端正技术人员的不良思想作风等。大型电机厂工地领导同志虽然一般地注意了这项工作，但是作得不经常不深入，因此第二期工程中的一些质量事故，仍然是由于技术人员没有按制度办事所造成的。
    第三，必须依靠工人，吸取他们的智慧，丰富责任制度的内容。大型电机厂工地柱子的模型板设计不当，在支模型板以前，混凝土工人就向工地领导干部提出一项合理建议：柱子两个大面支竖板，两个小面钉横板，随着浇灌混凝土随着钉板。这样，工人可以看到混凝土，便于捣固。但工地领导方面并未很好地研究采纳这个合理的建议。在浇灌混凝土前，工地党支部接受群众建议，曾召开了一次技术研究会，在会上群众提出在竖板上开口克服捣固困难的办法，并在会上作了决定。但工地领导干部也没有重视这一建议，督促执行，以致影响了工程质量。事实证明，工人群众有着丰富的实践知识，工地领导干部必须吸取工人的经验与智慧，才能不断丰富制度的内容，使制度深入贯彻下去。但是大型电机厂工地领导干部没有很好地研究工程的特点，不了解模型板设计适当与否对于工程质量有着严重的影响，盲目地以为第一期工程既然没有出毛病，因而就不重视不断改进工作的群众的合理建议。
    第四，必须加强政治工作，经常进行重视质量的教育。大型电机厂工地在建立技术质量责任制之初，曾广泛地向群众进行了重视质量的教育，收到很大效果。但在第二期工程浇灌北边柱子时，因为混凝土工小组内部不团结，个别工人闹情绪，就把干浆倒入模型板之中，捣固工作也未认真进行。由此证明，群众重视质量的思想并不是经过一次运动就能树立起来的。但是作好政治教育工作，必须工地党、行政、工会、青年团的干部在面向生产的原则之下，团结一致。在该工地检查发生质量事故的原因时，曾揭发了党、行政、工会干部在第二期工程施工前没有开会研究工程任务及如何加强政治工作，施工中谁也不知道谁在作什么，使质量教育的工作处在无人负责的状态之中。因此，要深入贯彻责任制还必须党、行政、工会、青年团的干部团结一致，围绕工程任务经常进行政治教育工作。
    第五，贯彻技术质量责任制是一件经常的工作，还在于基本建设施工具有复杂多变的特点。一、施工对象经常变化：如一个混凝土工小组，昨天浇灌基础，今天就要浇灌柱子，明天就可能去浇灌预制屋面板，工作物不同，操作方法与质量要求就随着变化；二、露天施工受着自然条件——风雨冷热及工作地点等影响。如大型厂工地柱子模板湿度较大，因天气躁热水分蒸发很快，木板收缩后模板与钢筋的距离缩小，捣固钎子插不下去，就影响了工程质量；三、各个工种互相结合而又有着矛盾。如大型电机厂工地浇灌混凝土柱子时，木工未按规定开口，架子工搭的架子不合适，都影响了混凝土工捣固工作的进行。就是混凝土工小组里，如果搅拌、运灰、捣固以及养护工作等，那一工作出了毛病都会影响工程质量；四、工程质量还受着进度的影响。经验一再证明，凡在工期紧迫之时，就容易忽视质量。如大型电机厂工地有些混凝土柱子的悬壁梁才浇灌三天，因急于砌砖就违反规定把模板拆掉，由于混凝土尚未凝固，有一个角就被碰坏了；五、目前施工中多为人工操作，但工人技术水平不高而且不平，思想认识又不一致，在组织上与思想教育方面稍有疏忽，问题就会随时发生。再扩大范围来说，基本建设施工还受着设计、技术供应、技术人员的技术水平与思想作风的影响。凡此种种，都说明技术管理是非常复杂而变化多端的。这就规定了贯彻技术质量责任制是一件经常的细致的工作。因此，要保证责任制度的深入贯彻，还必须规定经常的检查责任制贯彻情况的制度，发现问题随时解决，以防止任何漏洞的发生。
    第一工程公司在大型电机厂工地发生质量事故以后，通过质量大检查，检查了技术质量责任制的贯彻情况，发现一百二十七条责任制度中，贯彻了的只有二十七条，贯彻得不彻底的有七十九条，没有贯彻的有十八条，还有三条因工程项目尚未施工，没有执行。通过检查，不但使领导干部摸着了底，而且具体地批判了盲目乐观情绪，大大地教育了领导干部和群众。现在，该工地已经以主要工程为重点把责任制的贯彻继续推进了一步，并建立了四项经常检查责任制贯彻情况的制度，随着而来的又重新出现了重视质量的新气象。但是应该指出，大型电机厂工地所采取的措施，究竟已经迟了一步，其他单位应该吸取这个教训，在事故发生之前就有领导有组织有计划地把责任制深入贯彻下去。
    大型电机厂工地质量事故告诉我们，责任制的建立是比较容易的，要把责任制贯彻下去还是一件艰巨的工作。只有有领导有组织有计划地进行，才能推动责任制不断深入贯彻；也只有在技术质量责任制的深入贯彻当中，才能保证工程质量，逐步提高技术管理水平。
