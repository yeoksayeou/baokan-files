Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th - The Soviet people are enthusiastically celebrating the closing of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Laboring people in various regions are holding meetings to discuss the 1953 Soviet National Budget Law, the Agricultural Tax Law, and G.M. Malenkov's speech at the closing session of the Supreme Soviet. During the discussions, speakers unanimously expressed their warm support for the policies of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, and pledged to respond to the call of the Party and government with practical actions.

    In Moscow, the workers of the "Fighter" Machine Factory on Sunday duty talked about their feelings regarding the resolutions of the Supreme Soviet. Chief mechanic Tomaschek, when talking about the enthusiasm of the factory staff in responding to the call of the Party and government, said that recently, a work shift at the factory repaired a giant vertical lathe that required fourteen to sixteen hours of repair in eight hours. In Minsk, the workers of the casting repair workshop of the Minsk Tractor Factory all overfulfilled their production quotas. The non-ferrous metal casting workshop overproduced metal by 30% above the plan. Electrical worker Shatunovsky of the factory said: In capitalist countries, the majority of the budget is used to build military bases and take various adventurous and provocative actions. But in the Soviet Union, budget expenditures are used to improve the welfare of the people. Our responsibility is to manufacture inexpensive and high-quality machines for agriculture and the timber industry.

    Donbas miners are celebrating the Supreme Soviet meeting with great production achievements. Workers of the Stalin "Smolyanka" Mine No. 1 to 2 have already completed their August production tasks ahead of schedule. After listening to Comrade Malenkov's speech on the radio, the miners held heated discussions. Coal cutting team leader Chukanov said: In order to successfully complete the urgent tasks put forward by the Party and government, we miners should work better. My work team has already exceeded the task set to be completed by Miners' Day, extracting five hundred tons of coal extra. First section foreman Krivtsov reminded the miners to continue to work hard to reduce the cost of coal. He said: In July, we reduced the cost of mining each ton of coal by one ruble and fifty kopecks. This is only the first step. We have great potential that has not been used. We have the latest coal mining equipment, and we have rich experience in advanced labor organization, all of which enable us to continuously increase labor productivity and reduce the cost of coal.

    Collective farmers in various regions also enthusiastically discussed the resolutions of the Supreme Soviet meeting. Ma Jiluoxiang, a member of the Mikoyan Collective Farm in Echmiadzin District, said: The Agricultural Tax Law shows that the Party and government know the needs of collective farmers very well and care about collective farmers living better, richer, and more cultured lives. After listening to Comrade Malenkov's speech at a meeting of collective farmers in Batulino Village, Rybnov District, Lisen Oblast, collective farm chairman Nacharov said: We unanimously support the new budget of the Soviet government, which is a budget for peaceful construction, a budget for the great improvement of our country's economy and culture, and a budget for further improving the lives of the Soviet people. We must make stronger use of all the conditions given by the collective farm system for labor. We know how much tremendous work we must carry out in improving agriculture. We will do our best to improve agricultural technology and the efficiency of animal husbandry. The villagers unanimously expressed that they would work harder to develop livestock and vegetable production. The villagers enthusiastically support the new Agricultural Tax Law.

    苏联人民热烈拥护最高苏维埃会议决议
    决心用行动响应党和政府的号召 【新华社莫斯科十一日电】苏联人民热烈庆祝苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议的闭幕。各地劳动人民纷纷集会讨论最高苏维埃会议所通过的一九五三年苏联国家预算法、农业税法以及格·马·马林科夫在最高苏维埃闭幕会议上的演说。在讨论过程中，发言的人一致表示热烈拥护苏联共产党和苏维埃政府的政策，并以实际行动响应党和政府的号召。
    在莫斯科，“战士”机器工厂星期日值班的职工交谈了对最高苏维埃的决议的感想。总机械师托马歇克在谈到工厂工作人员响应党和政府号召的热情时说，最近，该厂有一个工作班以八小时的时间修理了一台需要十四到十六小时修理的巨型立式车床。在明斯克，明斯克拖拉机工厂翻砂修理车间的工人都超额完成了生产定额。有色金属翻砂间超计划多生产了百分之三十的金属。该厂电机工人沙图诺夫斯基说：在资本主义国家内预算的大部分费用用来建设军事基地和采取各种冒险和挑衅行动。但在苏联，预算支出是用来增进人民福利的。我们的责任就是为农业和伐木业制造价廉物美的机器。
    顿巴斯矿工以巨大的生产成就庆祝最高苏维埃会议。斯大林诺“斯摩里安卡”第一到二号矿坑工人已经提前完成了八月份的生产任务。矿工们从广播中收听了马林科夫同志的演说后进行了热烈的讨论。截煤工作队队长楚卡诺夫说：为了顺利地完成党和政府提出的迫切任务，我们矿工们应当更好地工作。我的工作队已经超过规定到矿工节完成的任务，多采了五百吨煤。第一工段工长克里甫佐夫提醒矿工们继续努力减低煤的成本。他说：七月份我们采每吨煤减低成本一卢布五十戈比。这只是第一步。我们有很大的潜在力没有使用。我们有着最新式的采煤装备，我们有先进劳动组织的丰富经验，所有这些使我们可能不断地提高劳动生产率和减低煤的成本。
    各地集体农民也热烈讨论了最高苏维埃会议的决议。爱茨米雅琴区米高扬集体农庄庄员马纪罗相说：农业税法令表明党和政府很好知道集体农民的需要，关心集体农民生活得更好、更富裕、更有文化。利森州雷布诺夫区巴土里诺村集体农庄庄员集会收听马林科夫同志的演说后，集体农庄主席纳查罗夫说：我们一致拥护苏维埃政府的新预算，这是和平建设的预算，我国经济和文化巨大提高的预算、进一步改善苏联人民生活的预算。我们要更坚强地利用集体农庄制度所给予的一切条件劳动。我们知道，我们在提高农业方面必须进行多么巨大的工作。我们将尽力提高农业的技术和饲畜业的效率。庄员们一致表示将更加努力发展牲畜和蔬菜的生产。庄员们热烈拥护农业税新法令。
