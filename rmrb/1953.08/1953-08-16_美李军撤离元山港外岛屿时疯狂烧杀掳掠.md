Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, August 15th: This reporter reports: When the American invading army and the Syngman Rhee puppet army withdrew from the many islands of various sizes outside Wonsan Harbor on the east coast of Korea, such as Rido, Ungdo, and Sindo, they carried out frenzied killing, arson, and plunder. Rido, the largest island outside Wonsan Harbor, has become a tragic "uninhabited island." The enemy set fire to this island and burned it for four days and four nights.

After the enemy withdrew, I followed the first group of Korean People's Army naval defense forces to land on this island. On the seashore, rows of fishermen's houses were gone, leaving only charred rubble and ashes, with some places still emitting crimson flames. At the end of the rubble, there was a broken cowshed. On the ruins, there was a wooden basin burned by the fire, half a rice-pounding pestle, and half a stone mill burned to a yellowish-brown color. From the wreckage of these commonly used items by the Korean people, it is not difficult to infer that ordinary people lived here a few days ago. But now, there is no sign of life on the island.

We then suddenly saw two piles of cremated human ashes on a sandy area on the hillside near the small airfield. These two ash piles were about three zhang long and one zhang wide. Iron rails wrapped with barbed wire were erected around the ash piles, and the ashes were mixed with iron wires used to tie the hands and feet of the victims. The sandy soil around the ash piles was burned yellowish-brown. Next to the ash piles, we found a magazine from an American submachine gun, and a few feet away, there were two large empty gasoline drums. On the road leading to this bloody slaughter ground, we saw a series of clear footprints, many of adults' footprints and many of children's footprints only three or four inches long. Judging from the shape of the footprints, most of the people who walked here were barefoot. On one iron rail, we also found a piece of burnt cloth, and based on the weave, we recognized it very familiarly: this is a unique Korean summer hemp cloth – a common fabric used by ordinary Korean women.

We continued our search forward. Most of the farmland here had long been flattened by the enemy to make roads and airfields. Some of the remaining fields were also mined by the enemy and strung with barbed wire. There are no crops here, only weeds taller than half a person. There is no one, no chicken, no dog, the only animals are three small wolves that the soldiers saw in the deep mountains.

On a ridge, a wooden sign erected by the enemy before their retreat stood. The enemy shamelessly wrote the words "Occupation Memorial" on the wooden sign. Next to the wooden sign was an enemy dance floor, which contrasted with the black rubble in the valley and the dilapidated fishing boats on the beach. American bayonets, American bullets, and photos of naked women cut from two American magazines were scattered near the dance floor...

This is the current face of this island, which once had 57 households and 239 people living on it. This is another ironclad proof of the American aggressors' homicidal nature and the destruction of humanity.

    美李军撤离元山港外岛屿时疯狂烧杀掳掠
    【新华社朝鲜前线十五日电】本社记者报道：美国侵略军和李承晚伪军在撤离朝鲜东海岸元山港外的丽岛、熊岛、薪岛等许多大小岛屿时，进行了疯狂的烧杀掳掠。元山港外最大的岛屿丽岛已成了一座惨绝人寰的“无人岛”。敌人曾经在这个岛上纵火燃烧了四天四夜。
    记者在敌人撤离后，随着第一批登陆丽岛的朝鲜人民军海防部队踏上了这个海岛。在海边上，一排排渔民的房屋不见了，剩下的只是一片焦黑的瓦砾和灰烬，有些地方还吐着殷红的火苗。在瓦砾堆的尽头，有一所破碎的牛栏。废墟上，还遗留着一只被烈火烧坏了的木盆、半根捣米杵和半片被火烧得变成焦黄色的石磨。从这些朝鲜人民常用的物品的残骸来看，人们不难推断：几天以前，这里还居住着普通的人民。可是，现在海岛上却一点生的气息也没有了。
    我们接着在小型飞机场附近山坡上的一片沙土上，蓦然看见两堆已经被烧化了的人的骨灰。这两处骨灰堆，长约三丈、宽约一丈。在骨灰堆的周围树立着一根根缠着铁丝网的铁轨，骨灰中间还夹杂着用来捆住死难者的手脚的铁丝。骨灰堆四周的沙土地已被烧得焦黄。在骨灰堆的旁边，我们找到了一只美国冲锋枪的弹夹，在几尺远以外，又有两个很大的空汽油桶。在通向这片血腥的屠场的道路上，我们看见了一连串清晰的脚印，有许多大人的脚印，也有许多只有三、四寸长的小孩子的脚印。从脚印的形状来看，走过这里的大部都是赤着脚的人们。在一根铁轨上，我们又发现了一块被烧化了的布片，根据布纹我们非常熟悉地认了出来：这是朝鲜特有的夏麻布——一种普通朝鲜妇女所常用的布料。
    我们继续搜索前进。这里的农田，大都早就被敌人平作公路和飞机场了。残留的一些田地里也被敌人埋上了地雷、拉上了铁丝网。这里没有庄稼，有的只是半人多高的杂草。这里没有一个人、一只鸡、一只狗，所有的唯一动物就是战士们在深山里看到的三只小狼。
    在一座山岭上，竖立着敌人撤退前竖立的一块木牌。敌人无耻地在木牌上面写着：“占领纪念”几个字。在木牌的旁边是敌人的一座舞池，它和山谷中黑色的瓦砾、海滩边残破的渔船相对照。舞池附近散落着美国刺刀、美国子弹以及从两张美国画报上剪下来的裸体女人的照片……。
    这便是这座曾有五十七户人家、二百三十九口人生活着的海岛的今天的面貌。这是嗜杀成性的美国侵略者一手制造的毁灭人类的又一铁的罪证。
