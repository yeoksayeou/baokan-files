    Autumn Grain Begins to Enter the Market in East China, Central South, and Other Regions
    State-Owned Grain Departments and Cooperatives Vigorously Carry Out Procurement Work
    From mid-August, new autumn grain in East China, Central South, North China, and Southwest China began to enter the market. State-owned grain departments and cooperatives in these regions have begun the work of procuring the new autumn grain.
    In the Xuzhou Special District of Jiangsu Province, Xin Hailian City has more than 14,000 jin of new corn entering the market every day; in Qidong and other places in the Nantong Special District, more than 10,000 jin of new corn enter the market every day. In the Fuyang and Suxian Special Districts of Anhui Province, new autumn grain has generally entered the market. On August 14th, Fuyang Special District had approximately 390,000 jin of red sorghum enter the market, and Suxian Special District had about 260,000 jin of red sorghum enter the market on the 17th; the three special districts of Chuxian, Fuyang, and Suxian also have more than 100,000 jin of corn entering the market daily. From August 10th, Tanghe, Fangcheng, Xinye, Biyang, and other counties in the Nanyang Special District of Henan Province each have more than 10,000 jin of new red sorghum entering the market daily. In the Linyi, Jining, Heze, Tai'an, and other special districts of Shandong Province, new red sorghum is also entering the market one after another. On the 12th, the amount of new red sorghum entering the market in Tancheng County, Linyi Special District, reached 10,400 jin. There is also new corn entering the market in Ding County, Hebei Province. In the Yanbei Special District of Shanxi Province, broad beans and peas have been entering the market since August 5th. As early as July, new corn was generally entering the market in the low-lying areas of Sichuan Province. Simultaneously with the entry of new autumn grain into the market, some farmers in some areas, seeing the hope of a good harvest, have also been selling off old grain.
    The time for new soybeans to enter the market is generally earlier than that for red sorghum and corn. In July, new soybeans in Fujian Province gradually entered the market; in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, about 16,000 jin of soybeans enter the market every day, and in Rui'an County, Ma Yu alone has more than 20,000 jin of soybeans entering the market every day; on July 28th, Dianjiang County in Sichuan Province also had more than 20,000 jin of new soybeans entering the market. In early August, new soybeans in the northern regions of Jiangsu Province also generally entered the market.
    After the new autumn grain entered the market in various places, state-owned grain departments and cooperatives, along with the purchase of wheat and rice, also began the work of purchasing the new autumn grain. For example, comparing the national purchase volume in early August with late July, the purchase volume of coarse grains has increased by 9.41 percent, and soybeans have increased by 22.52 percent. At present, the work of purchasing autumn grain in various places is generally progressing rapidly. Up to August 10th, state-owned grain departments in the East China region had completed 41.92 percent of the August plan for purchasing miscellaneous grains, the North China region had completed 40.94 percent, the Southwest region had completed 56.83 percent, and the Central South region had completed 27.78 percent.
    In order to protect the interests of farmers and vigorously expand procurement after the new autumn grain enters the market, the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government jointly issued procurement instructions on August 17th, and made arrangements for the supply of materials and the control and adjustment of prices. At the same time, the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives signed an agreement on the purchase of autumn grain and have notified various places to implement it.
    However, there are cases in some areas where the work of purchasing new coarse grains is not valued. For example, in the Xinyang Special District of Henan Province, 200,000 jin of new corn entered the market, but state-owned grain departments only purchased more than 60,000 jin, accounting for only 30 percent of the market volume. In early August, a batch of new red sorghum entered the market in Suiping County, Henan Province, but the local grain company refused to purchase it because it considered the moisture content too high, and the masses had no choice but to carry the grain home. The same situation exists in Ningling County in the Shangqiu Special District of Henan Province and in some areas of Sichuan and Guangxi provinces. All localities should pay attention to correcting this erroneous thinking of disliking purchasing grain with high moisture content, poor quality, and difficulty in storage, and must clearly recognize the important significance of purchasing autumn grain, conscientiously grasp the market, and earnestly implement the procurement spirit of "good grain gets good price," "price according to quality," and "good and bad are all purchased" to meet the grain selling requirements of farmers; at the same time, attention should be paid to strengthening storage work.

    华东、中南等地秋粮开始上市
    国营粮食部门和合作社大力展开收购工作
    八月中旬，华东、中南、华北和西南等地区的新秋粮开始上市。这些地区的国营粮食部门和合作社已展开新秋粮收购工作。
    江苏省徐州专区新海连市每天上市新玉米一万四千余斤；南通专区启东等地，新玉米每天上市达一万余斤。安徽省阜阳、宿县两专区新秋粮已普遍上市。阜阳专区八月十四日上市红粮约三十九万余斤，宿县专区十七日上市红粮二十六万斤左右；滁县、阜阳、宿县三专区每日上市玉米也在十万斤以上。河南省南阳专区唐河、方城、新野、泌阳等县从八月十日起，每天各有新红粮万余斤上市。山东省临沂、济宁、菏泽、泰安等专区新红粮也陆续上市。临沂专区郯城县十二日新红粮上市量达一万零四百斤。河北省定县市场也有新玉米上市。山西省雁北专区八月五日起已有蚕豆、豌豆上市。四川省早在七月间，低山地区即普遍有新玉米上市。与新秋粮上市同时，部分地区农民见丰收有望，也纷纷出售陈粮。
    新黄豆上市时间，一般较红粮、玉米更早。七月份，福建省新黄豆即逐渐上市；浙江省温州市每天上市大豆约一万六千斤，瑞安县仅马屿一地每天上市大豆即达二万余斤；四川省的垫江县七月二十八日也有新豆二万余斤上市。八月初，江苏北部地区新黄豆也普遍进入市场。
    各地新秋粮上市后，国营粮食部门和合作社随同收购小麦、大米，又展开了新秋粮的收购工作。如以全国八月上旬收购量和七月下旬比较，粗粮收购量已增加百分之九点四一，大豆增加百分之二十二点五二。目前，各地收购秋粮工作一般进展还快。到八月十日止，华东区国营粮食部门完成八月份杂粮收购计划百分之四十一点九二，华北区完成百分之四十点九四，西南区完成百分之五十六点八三，中南区完成百分之二十七点七八。
    为了在新秋粮上市后，保护农民利益，大力展开收购，中央人民政府商业部和粮食部已于八月十七日联合发出收购指示，对物资供应及价格掌握、调整等项工作，都做了布置。同时，中央人民政府粮食部和中华全国合作社联合总社签订了收购秋粮的协议，并已通知各地执行。
    但部分地区有不重视新粗粮收购工作的情况。如河南省信阳专区上市新玉米二十万斤，国营粮食部门仅收进六万余斤，只占上市量的百分之三十。八月上旬，河南省遂平县上市一批新红粮，当地粮食公司嫌水分大没有收购，群众只好背粮回家。河南省商邱专区宁陵县及四川、广西等省部分地区，也有同样情况。各地应注意纠正这种嫌水分重、质量差、难保管而不愿收购的错误思想，必须明确认识到收购秋粮的重要意义，认真掌握市场，并切实贯彻“优粮优价”、“依质论价”、“好次均收”的收购精神，以满足农民售粮要求；同时应注意加强保管工作。
