Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th: The representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross, who visited the Busan POW camp, had to return to Panmunjom on the 18th after waiting for ten days, as the U.S. military authorities had not changed their obstructive attitude since being forced to stop working on the evening of the 8th.

The Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives arrived in Busan on the 4th, but were only allowed to speak with eight Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in the U.S. military office on the 6th. These eight prisoners of war were all disabled or physically weak wounded or sick people, some even using crutches. When the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives asked them to sit down, they were stopped by Colonel Lane, the commander of the U.S. POW camp. When the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives changed to another room to read out letters of sympathy to the prisoners of war, Lane again used the excuse that the words of sympathy had not been checked and ordered U.S. soldiers to push our prisoners of war out of the room.

On the 7th, the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives were allowed to talk to the prisoners of war for the second time, but the number had been reduced to two. The talks were conducted under very difficult conditions. Every word of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives, even asking "How are you?" had to be translated into English by the interpreter for Lane to check, and only after his approval were they allowed to continue the conversation. After a while, the U.S. military POW camp authorities, again using the excuse of "avoiding unexpected incidents," forced the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives to stop talking and leave the area.

When the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives appeared in Busan, the U.S. POW camp authorities used force to prevent our prisoners of war from welcoming them with salutes or applause. The U.S. POW camp authorities also fired tear gas at our prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated, to prevent them from seeing the Korean and Chinese Red Cross personnel visiting other prisoners of war. This fact proves that the U.S. is still attempting to achieve its goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war by using military threats.

On the evening of the 8th, the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives in the Busan group were forced to terminate their work after the U.S. military POW camp authorities announced Major General McGarr's, the commander of the POW camp, overbearing instructions to the POW camp restricting the joint Red Cross team's visits.

Due to the U.S.'s deliberate obstruction of the joint Red Cross team from providing humanitarian services to prisoners of war in accordance with the relevant provisions of the armistice agreement, so far, among the five groups of joint Red Cross teams visiting U.S. military POW camps in South Korea, the Korean and Chinese representatives in the Jeju Island and Busan groups have been forced to return to Panmunjom.

    美方蓄意阻挠联合红十字会小组对战俘提供人道主义服务
    我方红十字会代表被迫自釜山返回板门店
    【新华社开城十九日电】访问釜山战俘营的朝中红十字会代表自八日晚被迫停止工作以后，经十天的等待，由于美方军事当局仍未改变其阻挠的态度，不得不在十八日回到板门店。
    朝中红十字会代表四日抵达釜山，六日才被允许在美军办公室和八个朝中被俘人员谈话。这八个被俘人员都是残废或身体虚弱的伤病人员，有的还拄着拐杖。朝中红十字会代表请他们坐下，竟被美军战俘营司令官莱恩上校阻止。当朝中红十字会代表换了另一个房间向被俘人员宣读慰问信时，莱恩又藉口慰问词未经检查，命令美军士兵把我被俘人员推出房外。
    七日，朝中红十字会代表第二次被允许与被俘人员谈话，但人数已减少至二人。谈话是在很艰难的条件下进行的。朝中红十字会代表的每一句话，即使是问一句“你好吗？”也要经过翻译人员译成英语给莱恩检查，要经他同意后才准许继续谈话。片刻之后，美军战俘营当局又藉口“避免发生意外事件”，强迫朝中红十字会代表中止谈话，离开该地。
    当朝中红十字会代表出现在釜山，我方被俘人员以敬礼或鼓掌来欢迎时，美方战俘营当局竟以武力禁止。美方战俘营当局还对我方不直接遣返的被俘人员投射催泪弹，以禁止他们看见朝中红十字会人员访问其他被俘人员。这一事实证明，美方仍然企图以武力威胁来达到强迫扣留战俘的目的。
    八日晚，釜山美军战俘营当局宣布美军战俘营司令部长官麦克加尔少将给战俘营的蛮横限制联合红十字会小组访问的训令以后，釜山分组的朝中红十字会代表被迫终止了工作。
    由于美方蓄意阻挠联合红十字会小组根据停战协定有关条款对战俘提供人道主义的服务，迄今为止，在南朝鲜美军战俘营访问的联合红十字会小组五个分组中，已有济州岛和釜山两个分组的朝中代表被迫返回板门店。
