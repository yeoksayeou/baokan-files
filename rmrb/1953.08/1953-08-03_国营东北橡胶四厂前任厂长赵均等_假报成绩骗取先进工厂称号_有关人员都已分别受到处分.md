Former Director of State-Owned Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4, Zhao Jun, etc.,
    Falsely Reported Achievements to Obtain the Title of Advanced Factory
    Relevant Personnel Have All Been Punished Separately
    The Discipline Inspection Commission of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, after carefully studying the mistakes of Zhao Jun, the former director of the State-Owned Rubber Factory No. 4, Pan Ju, the deputy secretary of the General Branch, Ding Hongtao, the deputy director, and Zeng Xianning, the chairman of the Trade Union, who had colluded and used deceptive means to falsely report achievements and obtain the title of "Advanced Factory" since 1951, and with the approval of the Discipline Inspection Commission of the CPC Central Committee Northeast Bureau, officially announced the following disciplinary actions within the Party against Zhao Jun and others on June 8: Zhao Jun was given a punishment of probation within the Party; Pan Ju was given a public warning within the Party; Zeng Xianning was given a face-to-face warning within the Party; Ding Hongtao was asked to make a public self-criticism at a meeting.

    In 1951 and 1952, Rubber Factory No. 4 was twice评 awarded the title of "Advanced Factory" in the Shenyang City Light Industry System. The main basis at that time was: (1) Over-fulfilling the production increase and economization plan and reducing costs in 1951 and 1952; (2) Carrying out huge technological reforms in the production increase and economization; (3) Being good at mobilizing the masses. According to the inspection by the Central Light Industry Department inspection team and the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee in April of this year, it was found that the main parts constituting the above basis were all false. The details are as follows:

    First, the main reason why the factory was rated as an advanced factory in Shenyang City in 1951 was that the output increased steadily month by month, the product quality improved month by month, and the cost decreased month by month. But the opposite was true. For example, the output in August of that year increased by 48.79 percent compared with June, but only increased by 29.72 percent in September. The appearance quality, except for July which was slightly better than June, was not as good as June in the other months. And in July, when the quality was better, Li Yutian, another deputy director of the factory, forcibly put 700 pairs of second-class rubber shoes into the first-class products in order to complete the first-class product plan. The cost in December of that year was higher than in November. However, the cost was reduced in the factory's summary, because they deducted five grams of raw rubber from the cost of each pair of rubber shoes produced in that month, making the cost falsely decrease by more than 62 million yuan.

    Second, the basis for the factory being rated as an advanced factory again in 1952 was that the total value of production increase and economization for the whole year reached 20.6 billion yuan, exceeding the state's prescribed task by 62 percent. But in fact, only 33.17 percent of the profits were turned over. After the production increase and economization movement was launched in 1952, the factory, under the leadership of Director Zhao Jun, regardless of production conditions and technical requirements, adopted the method of blindly shortening recording time and reducing raw rubber. In this way, on the surface, raw materials were saved and output was increased, but the quality was very poor. As a result, the sales of rubber shoes produced by the factory in 1952 were not good, and the average sales price could not reach the ex-factory price, and the final sales price was lower than the cost. They compensated department stores for losses of 5.8 billion yuan alone. Poor product quality also caused a large backlog of products and poor capital turnover. The capital turnover period in the fourth quarter of 1952 reached 740 days (the quota turnover period was 73 days). At present, bank credit has reached 50 billion yuan, and the interest alone costs about 200 million yuan per month.

    Third, another reason why the factory was rated as an advanced factory in 1952 was that it had a major invention - the successful experiment of mechanical cold-pressing molding. But in fact, it was not successful. Many technicians and workers in the factory had put a lot of effort into this experiment, but Zhao Jun used the slight gains from this experiment to brag everywhere and reported to the original Northeast Light Industry Bureau that the cold-pressing molding method could increase output by two times and increase production by more than 70 billion yuan. As a result, he received bonuses and award banners. Afterwards, Zhao Jun did not support the research, and even dismantled the machine, although this experiment was likely to succeed.

    Fourth, when the factory was rated as an advanced factory in 1951 and 1952, it was believed that they were good at mobilizing the masses, but the facts were completely different. Taking the mobilization of production increase and economization in 1952 as an example: In 1952, the factory's plan to increase production and economize by more than 20,000 tons of grain was "completed" on October 15 by "saving" raw rubber regardless of quality. After completion, Zhao Jun and the head of the accounting section calculated that by relying on "saving" raw rubber and other measures, they could still "increase production and economize" by 10,000 tons of grain by the end of the year. However, in order to make people feel that the factory was good at mobilizing the masses, Zhao Jun and others pretended to mobilize the masses to find tricks, and notified the workshops to discuss the plan for "increasing production and economizing" by 10,000 tons of grain. When notifying the workshops, he told the workers: "The figures for increasing production and economizing are already there, just find a few items." But when the workers in the compression workshop put forward a major rationalization proposal to change the "method of pulling the shoe cover", he ignored it. However, Zhao Jun and others told the higher authorities and newspapers that the reason why they could still increase production and economize by 10,000 tons of grain by the end of the year was because they mobilized the workers to discuss and found new tricks.

    The above deceptive behavior was mainly carried out under the leadership of Zhao Jun. However, Pan Ju, the deputy secretary of the General Branch of the factory's Party, Ding Hongtao, the deputy director, and Zeng Xianning, the chairman of the Trade Union, etc., did not stop or expose these deceptive behaviors when they knew about them, but instead colluded with Zhao Jun and others to help him carry out the deception. Therefore, they should also bear major responsibility for these bad behaviors. For example, Pan Ju and Zeng Xianning, etc., knew that the quality of rubber shoes was very poor, but they still turned a blind eye and reported to the higher-level Party and trade union that in 1952, raw materials were saved "under the condition of ensuring quality" and "labor efficiency was improved, and product quality was improved", etc.

    In order to achieve their goal of fraudulently obtaining personal honor, Zhao Jun, Pan Ju and others also adopted extremely bad methods of打击 suppressing the advanced and抬举 promoting the backward, so that righteousness could not be promoted in the factory, and evil spirits dominated. For example, Lu Chongwei, the head of the planning section who specialized in making false reports for Zhao Jun, was favored by the leading cadres. Li Qingzhi, the director of the Second Workshop, had a bad style, but he was promoted to director of the workshop because he was diligent in contacting the leading cadres. However, Jiang Changwu, the director of the compounding workshop, was an honest person who worked hard and dared to expose their shortcomings, but he was not valued by the leaders. Yu Yuanxiang was an advanced producer, and her advanced experience had been actively accepted and promoted by the workers, but because she dared to make suggestions to the leaders and expose their shortcomings, it caused displeasure among these people, so they attributed her model deeds to another worker. In the end, they even completely lost their basic political vigilance and reported to the higher authorities to promote Liu Enzhi, a landlord who was good at flattering (and has been arrested by the People's Government), as the deputy secretary of the General Branch of the Party.

    The inspection team of the Central Light Industry Department, with the assistance of various departments, has investigated the violations of national laws and regulations by the factory leaders. Based on the seriousness of this issue, the Central Light Industry Department has given the former director Zhao Jun the administrative punishment of dismissal.

    国营东北橡胶四厂前任厂长赵均等
    假报成绩骗取先进工厂称号
    有关人员都已分别受到处分
    中共沈阳市委纪律检查委员会，认真研究了国营橡胶四厂前任厂长赵均、总支副书记潘巨、副厂长丁洪涛、工会主席曾宪宁等，从一九五一年起，同流合污，以欺骗手段假报成绩，骗取“先进工厂”称号的错误后，经中共中央东北局纪律检查委员会批准，于六月八日，正式宣布给赵均等人以如下党内处分：给赵均以留党察看处分；给潘巨以党内当众警告处分；给曾宪宁以党内当面警告处分；丁洪涛则在大会公开检讨。
    橡胶四厂在一九五一、一九五二年中，曾两次被评为沈阳市轻工业系统的“先进工厂”。当时的主要依据是：（一）在一九五一年和一九五二年两年中超额完成了增产节约计划，降低了成本；（二）在增产节约中，进行了巨大的技术改革；（三）善于发动群众。据今年四月份中央轻工业部检查组及中共沈阳市委的检查，发现构成上述依据的主要部分，都是虚假的。现分别说明如下：
    第一、该厂在一九五一年被评为沈阳市先进工厂的主要根据是，产量月月稳步上升，产品质量月月提高，成本月月下降。但事实恰恰相反。如是年八月产量比六月增加了百分之四十八点七九，九月份却只增加了百分之二十九点七二。外观质量，除七月份比六月份好一点之外，其余各月都不如六月份。而质量较好的七月份，还是该厂另一副厂长李玉田把七百双二等品胶鞋硬放入一等品内才完成一等品计划的。是年十二月份的成本比十一月份的高。但在该厂总结上成本却降低了，原因是他们将该月已制成的每双胶鞋成本内扣去五克生胶，使成本虚降六千二百余万元。
    第二、一九五二年该厂再次被评为先进工厂的依据是，全年完成增产节约总值达二百零六亿元，超过国家规定任务的百分之六十二。但事实上却只完成上缴利润的百分之三十三点一七。一九五二年展开增产节约运动后，该厂即在厂长赵均的主持下，不顾生产条件与技术要求，采用了盲目缩短记录时间和减少生胶的办法。这样，表面上看来节省了原料，提高了产量，但质量却十分低劣。结果，一九五二年该厂所产胶鞋的销路很不好，平均出售价格达不到出厂价格，最后出售价格比成本还低。他们仅赔偿百货公司的损失即达五十八亿元。因产品质量不好还造成了大批产品积压，资金周转不灵，一九五二年第四季度资金周转期竟达七百四十天（定额周转期为七十三天），目前由银行信贷已达五百亿元，每月仅利息就要支出两亿元左右。
    第三、一九五二年该厂被评为先进工厂的另一原因是有了重大的发明创造——试验机械冷压成型法成功。但事实上却没有成功。该厂许多技术人员和工人对这一试验曾花费了很大力量，赵均却利用这一试验中的些微收获，到处吹嘘，并报原东北轻工业局说：冷压成型法可使产量提高两倍，能增产七百多亿元。因而领到了奖金和奖旗。事后赵均却不支持研究了，连机器都拆了，虽然这一试验是有可能成功的。
    第四、一九五一年与一九五二年该厂被评为先进工厂时，都认为他们是善于发动群众的，但事实却完全不是这样。以一九五二年动员增产节约为例：一九五二年该厂增产节约二万多吨粮食的计划，在十月十五日就以不顾质量“节约”生胶的办法“完成”了。完成后，赵均和会计科长核计靠“节约”生胶等措施，到年底还可“增产节约”一万吨粮食。但是赵均等为了使人感到该厂善于发动群众，便假意发动群众找窍门，通知车间讨论“增产节约”一万吨粮食的措施计划。在通知各车间的时候他就告诉工人：“增产节约的数字已经有了，只要找几个项目就行啦。”但当压成车间工人提出改变“扯鞋盖胶办法”的重大合理化建议时，他却置之不理。可是赵均等却向上级和报社说，到年底所以还可增产节约一万吨粮食，是因为发动工人讨论，又找到新窍门的结果。
    上述欺骗行为，主要是由赵均主持进行的。但该厂党总支副书记潘巨、副厂长丁洪涛、工会主席曾宪宁等知道这些欺骗行为也没有加以制止揭发，反而与赵均等同流合污，帮助他进行欺骗，因而对这些欺骗的恶劣行为，也应负重大责任，比如潘巨、曾宪宁等都知道胶鞋质量十分低劣，可是他们还闭着眼睛向上级党和工会报告说，一九五二年是在“保证质量的条件下节约了原材料”“提高了劳动效率，提高了产品质量”等。
    赵均、潘巨等人为了达到他们的骗取个人荣誉的目的，还极端恶劣地采用了打击先进，抬举落后的办法，使厂内正气不能伸张，邪气占了统治地位。如专门给赵均制造假报告的计划科长卢崇伟就受到领导干部的宠信。二车间主任李清芝作风恶劣，但和领导干部走动殷勤，被提拔为车间主任。而配炼车间主任姜长武是个埋头苦干、有啥说啥敢于揭露他们缺点的老实人，却不为领导所重视。于元香是先进生产者，她的先进经验已为工人主动接受推广，但由于她敢于向领导上提意见，揭露他们的缺点，却引起了这些人的不快，就把她的模范事迹安到别一个工人身上去了。最后，他们甚至完全失去了政治上的起码警惕性，报请上级提拔善于阿谀逢迎的翻把地主刘恩志（已被人民政府逮捕）为党总支副书记。
    中央轻工业部检查组在各部门协助下，对该厂领导的违犯国家法纪现象已调查清楚。根据这一问题的严重性，中央轻工业部已给予前任厂长赵均行政上撤职处分。
