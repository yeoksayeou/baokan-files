Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 23rd. In the first half of 1953, the Northeast China region achieved remarkable results in implementing the first annual plan of the national construction First Five-Year Plan. New developments and improvements were made in the region's industrial production, capital construction, and transportation.

In the first half of 1953, the total output value of state-owned industrial enterprises and local state-owned industrial enterprises in the Northeast region reached 100.1% of the semi-annual plan, accounting for 48.1% of the annual plan. The total output value of state-owned industrial enterprises in the region reached 99.1% of the semi-annual plan, an increase of 28.5% over the same period last year. Among them, the total output value of enterprises in the heavy industry system, fuel industry system, First Ministry of Machine Building system, light industry system, and textile industry system reached 101.6% of the semi-annual plan, an increase of 30.3% over the same period last year. The total output value of local state-owned industries in the region reached 103.1% of the semi-annual plan.

In the first half of this year, among the 56 major products of state-owned industries in the Northeast region, 37 major products, including metallurgical coke, shale crude oil, gasoline, rich iron ore, pig iron, electrolytic copper, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, electric motors, transformers, lathes, planers, rock drills, ball bearings, cement, and cotton yarn, completed or exceeded their production plans. Among the 22 major products of local state-owned industries, 14 major products, including raw coal, solid caustic soda, shovels, radiators, flour, and canned meat, completed or exceeded their production plans. Compared with the same period last year, the output of various major products has increased significantly. For example, power generation increased by 52.5% compared with the first half of last year, raw coal by 11.1%, shale crude oil by 24.7%, gasoline by 17.8%, steel ingots by 25.7%, steel products by 19.1%, electrolytic copper by 40.6%, electric motors (kW) by 18.3%, transformers (kVA) by 239.4%, ball bearings by 131.9%, bicycles by 90.7%, cement by 55.7%, plate glass by 66%, cotton yarn by 10.5%, and cotton cloth by 14.8%.

In the first half of this year, state-owned and local state-owned industrial enterprises in the Northeast region, focusing on strengthening planned management and improving product quality, adopted specific measures such as implementing work plans, strengthening original records, and establishing and improving various responsibility systems. They also leveraged the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers, continued to discover and promote various advanced experiences, and implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts. As a result, they achieved new successes in improving production technology and management, ensuring balanced production, improving labor efficiency, improving product quality, and reducing production costs. In terms of improving production technology, the iron and steel industry system transformed old iron-smelting furnaces into new, automated blast furnaces. In the first half of the year, the machinery manufacturing industry successfully trial-produced more than 150 new products, such as radial drilling machines, 145-ton heavy-duty vertical lathes, and 66,000-volt 10,000 kVA large transformers. Significant improvements were also made in the production technology of the coal mining industry, metallurgical industry, textile industry, and local state-owned industries. In terms of balanced production, many factories and mines have made achievements. For example, after the Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1 launched the "Daily Progress Plan Competition" in May, it basically achieved balanced completion of the output plan on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis. Some factories and mines that had long failed to complete their plans were also able to complete their output and output value plans on a monthly basis after strengthening planned management. In terms of labor efficiency, the labor productivity of various industrial and mining enterprises under the five central industrial ministries increased by 22.7% from January to May this year compared with the same period last year. Product quality has also been greatly improved in the first half of this year. In the iron and steel industry, the proportion of first-grade pig iron has increased to 96.17%, and the proportion of high-quality steel has increased from 16.8% in the first half of last year to 32.7%. The scrap rate of castings in the machinery manufacturing industry has been reduced to about 14%. The wear resistance of tires in the rubber industry has doubled compared with last year. In terms of product costs, enterprises under the Textile Administration and the Electric Power Bureau alone saved more than 30 billion yuan in costs from January to May this year.

In the first year of the national planned economic construction, capital construction in the Northeast region experienced a tremendous increase. In 1953, the total planned investment in the Northeast region increased by 52.8% compared with the actual total investment in 1952. The total capital construction investment in the region in the first half of the year accounted for 26.2% of the annual plan, and the actual investment was nearly double that of the first half of last year, with the heavy industry system increasing by 1.3 times compared with the first half of last year.

Generally speaking, this year's capital construction projects started more than a month earlier than last year. In the first half of the year, the area of projects started in the region reached 58% of the planned area of projects to be started throughout the year. Among them, the area of projects started in the heavy industry system reached 62.2% of the planned area of projects to be started throughout the year. Although some important projects of great significance to China's national industrialization started later, most of them had started by June, and the quality of the projects was basically guaranteed. These included the new First Automobile Factory and Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory; and the rebuilt and expanded Large Rolling Steel Mill, Seamless Steel Tube Mill, Thin Plate Rolling Steel Mill, Machine Factory No. 1, Machine Factory No. 2, Electric Factory No. 7, and Pneumatic Tool Factory. The Seamless Steel Tube Mill is about to be test-run, and the Large Rolling Steel Mill will be handed over for production in the second half of the year. In addition, the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine, China's first highly mechanized coal mine, officially started production on July 1; the construction of the seven and a half pairs of coal mine vertical shafts has completed the excavation of eleven main and auxiliary shaft barrels in the first half of the year.

With the growth of industrial production, capital construction, and the expansion of commodity circulation, transportation has also developed accordingly. In the first half of this year, the volume of freight transported by railways completed 101.5% of the plan, an increase of 27.4% over the same period last year, and the total number of loaded cars completed 100.8% of the plan, an increase of 21.5% over the same period last year. In the first half of the year, the volume of inland river freight on the Songhua River completed 128.6% of the plan, an increase of 27.3% over the same period last year. The volume of freight transported by highways (including urban areas) accounted for 56.6% of the annual plan, an increase of 105.2% over the same period last year. In the first half of the year, postal and telecommunications financial revenue reached 51.9% of the annual plan.

Due to the development of industry, the number of employed people in the Northeast region has increased. Since the labor employment registration was held in September last year, more than 80,000 people have been employed through introductions between May and June this year. In the first half of the year, due to the appropriate expansion of the scope of implementation of the Regulations on Labor Insurance for Workers and Staff, the number of workers and staff enjoying labor insurance benefits increased by 2.1% compared with the same period last year, and labor insurance benefits have also been improved.

Although tremendous achievements have been made in industrial production, capital construction, and transportation in the Northeast region in the first half of 1953, there are still some shortcomings and problems. For example, in industrial production, the degree of production development and work improvement in various systems and departments is still uneven; some enterprises have not completed the plan evenly and comprehensively; and in some enterprises, the shortcomings of low product quality, poor labor discipline, many accidents, and high costs still exist. In capital construction, although the construction progress in the first half of the year was faster than last year, it still did not meet the planned requirements; except for important projects with better quality, the general civil and architectural engineering has not yet fully met the "good" standard.

In order to achieve greater achievements in the region's industrial production, capital construction, and transportation in the second half of this year, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee recently issued instructions on launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy. Now, party committees at all levels and business departments of the CPC are, according to this instruction, leading and mobilizing workers and staff to participate in the competition, striving to comprehensively and overfulfill the first annual plan of the national construction First Five-Year Plan.

    东北执行国家建设计划成绩显著
    工业生产、基本建设和交通运输都有新发展
    【新华社沈阳二十三日电】一九五三年上半年，东北区执行国家建设第一个五年计划的第一个年度计划已获得显著成就，全区工业生产、基本建设、交通运输等方面，都有了新的发展与改进。
    一九五三年上半年，东北区国营工业和地方国营工业企业的总产值，达到上半年计划的百分之一百点一，占全年计划的百分之四十八点一。全区国营工业总产值为上半年计划的百分之九十九点一，比去年同期增长百分之二十八点五。其中，重工业系统、燃料工业系统、第一机械工业系统、轻工业系统、纺织工业系统等企业的总产值达到上半年计划的百分之一百零一点六，比去年同期增长百分之三十点三。全区地方国营工业总产值达到上半年计划的百分之一百零三点一。
    今年上半年，东北区国营工业五十六种主要产品中，有冶金焦炭、页岩原油、汽油、富铁矿、生铁、电铜、硫酸、硝酸、电动机、变压器、车床、刨床、凿岩机、滚珠轴承、水泥、棉纱等三十七种主要产品完成或超额完成了产量计划。地方国营工业的二十二种主要产品中，有原煤体及固体火碱、铲?机、暖气片、面粉、肉类罐头等十四种主要产品完成或超额完成产量计划。各种主要产品的产量和去年同期比较，有显著的增长，如发电量较去年上半年增长百分之五十二点五，原煤一十一点一，页岩原油二十四点七，汽油一十七点八，钢锭二十五点七，钢材一十九点一，电铜四十点六，电动机（瓩）一十八点三，变压器（千伏安）二百三十九点四，滚珠轴承一百三十一点九，自行车九十点七，水泥五十五点七，平板玻璃六十六，棉纱一十点五，棉布一十四点八。
    今年上半年，东北区国营工业和地方国营工业企业，分别以加强计划管理和改进产品质量为中心，采取了贯彻作业计划、加强原始记录、建立并健全各种责任制度等具体措施，并发挥了广大职工的积极性和创造性，继续发掘和推广了各种先进经验，执行和贯彻了苏联专家的各项建议，因而在改进生产技术和生产管理，保证均衡生产，提高劳动效率，改进产品质量，降低生产成本等方面都取得了一些新的成就。在生产技术的改进上，钢铁工业系统把旧的炼铁炉改建成为新型的自动化的炼铁高炉；机械制造工业上半年试制成功摇臂钻床、一百四十五吨重型立式车床、六万六千伏特一万千伏安的大型变压器等一百五十多种新产品；煤矿工业、冶金工业、纺织工业和地方国营工业的生产技术也都有显著的改进。在均衡生产方面，许多厂矿都做出了成绩，如东北石油一厂自五月份开展“日进度计划竞赛”后，基本上做到按日、按旬、按月均衡地完成产量计划。有一些过去长期完不成计划的厂矿，自加强计划管理后，也能够按月完成产量、产值计划了。在劳动效率方面，中央五个工业部所属各工矿企业的劳动生产率，今年一月至五月比去年同期提高了百分之二十二点七。今年上半年产品质量也大大提高了。钢铁工业中，一级生铁所占的比重已提高到百分之九十六点一七，优质钢所占比重已从去年上半年的百分之一十六点八提高到百分之三十二点七；机械制造工业的铸件废品率已降低到百分之一十四左右；橡胶工业的轮胎耐磨性能比去年提高一倍。在产品成本方面，仅纺织管理局、电业局所属企业今年一月至五月即节约成本三百余亿元。
    在国家计划经济建设开始的第一年，东北区的基本建设有了巨大的增长。一九五三年东北区的计划投资总额较一九五二年实际投资总额增加百分之五十二点八。上半年全区基本建设投资总额占全年计划的百分之二十六点二，实际投放的数字比去年上半年增加将近一倍，其中重工业系统比去年上半年增加一点三倍。
    今年的基本建设工程，一般来说比去年早开工一个多月。上半年全区已开工工程的面积，达到全年计划开工工程面积的百分之五十八。其中重工业系统已开工工程的面积达全年计划开工工程面积的百分之六十二点二。对我国国家工业化有重大意义的重要工程，虽然有一部分开工较迟，但到六月为止，大部分都已开工，并且基本上保证了工程质量。其中新建的有第一汽车厂、量具刃具厂等；改建和扩建的有大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、薄板轧钢厂、机械一厂、机械二厂、电工七厂、风动工具厂等。无缝钢管厂即将试车，大型轧钢厂将于下半年内移交生产。此外，我国第一个高度机械化采煤的海州露天矿，已于七月一日开始正式生产；七对半煤矿竖井的建设，上半年已完成十一个主、副井井筒的掘进工程。
    随着工业生产、基本建设的增长及商品流转的扩大，交通运输也有了相应的发展。今年上半年，铁路运输货物吨数完成计划百分之一百零一点五，比去年同期增加了百分之二十七点四，总装车数完成计划百分之一百点八，比去年同期增加了百分之二十一点五。上半年松花江内河货运吨数完成计划百分之一百二十八点六，比去年同期增加了百分之二十七点三。公路（包括市内）运输货物吨数占全年计划百分之五十六点六，比去年同期增加百分之一百零五点二。上半年邮政电信财务收入达到全年计划的百分之五十一点九。
    由于工业的发展，东北区就业人数已有增加。从去年九月举办劳动就业登记以后，至今年五、六月间，已有八万多人经介绍就业。上半年由于适当扩大了职工劳动保险条例的实施范围，享受劳动保险待遇的职工人数比去年同期增加百分之二点一，劳动保险待遇也有提高。
    一九五三年上半年，东北区工业生产、基本建设、交通运输工作中虽然取得了巨大的成就，但也还存在着一些缺点和问题。如在工业生产中，各系统各部门的生产发展和工作改进程度还是不平衡的；有的企业完成计划还不够均衡和全面；在部分企业中，产品质量低、劳动纪律差、事故多、成本高的缺点仍然存在。在基本建设中，上半年的施工进度虽比去年快，但仍未达到计划要求；工程质量除重要工程较好外，一般土木建筑工程还没全部达到“好”的标准。
    为了使今年下半年全区工业生产、基本建设、交通运输获得更大的成就，中共中央东北局日前已发出关于开展增产节约的指示。现在中共各级党委与业务部门正根据这项指示，有领导地发动职工参加竞赛，为全面地超额完成国家建设第一个五年计划的第一个年度计划而奋斗。
