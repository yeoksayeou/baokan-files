From all cotton-producing areas, high-quality raw cotton is being fully supplied to Shanghai.
The output and quality of cotton yarn in Shanghai's textile mills have significantly improved.

    Raw cotton from all cotton-producing areas across the country, supplied to Shanghai, the center of China's textile industry, has seen significant improvement in both quality and quantity.
    Due to the fundamental change in the supply of raw cotton, the output of cotton yarn from Shanghai's state-owned factories in the first half of this year has nearly reached the total output for the entire year of 1949. The output of private factories in the first half of the year also increased by 60% compared to the same period in 1949. Before liberation, due to the low quality and insufficient output of domestic raw cotton, Shanghai's textile mills were forced to suspend operations for one and a half months in 1951 due to insufficient supply. In 1952, due to the rapid increase in raw cotton production, the quantity supplied to Shanghai for industrial use increased, providing a sufficient guarantee for production. There has also been a significant improvement in the quality of raw cotton. Before liberation, most domestic cotton was coarse, with short fibers. In addition, middlemen added water, impurities, and adulterants, resulting in high moisture content, many impurities, and uneven fiber length, making it unsuitable as an industrial raw material. Since liberation, People's Governments at all levels in cotton-producing areas have led farmers to improve cotton seeds. Now, the S-type cotton produced in the Yellow River basin, and the D-type and Dai-type cotton produced in the Yangtze River basin are not only long-fibered but also fine, soft, and white, with excellent tensile strength. Cooperatives implement a policy of better prices for better quality in cotton purchases, encouraging farmers to sell cotton according to grades, which not only fundamentally changed the past phenomenon of adulteration by middlemen, but also greatly improved the quality of cotton products. According to a report from the East China Textile Fiber Inspection Bureau, the moisture and impurity content of raw cotton from various regions is now close to the standard, and some are even below the standard.
    Based on the sufficient supply and improved quality of raw cotton, the fiber length of the raw cotton used by Shanghai cotton textile mills to produce large quantities of 20-count yarn has increased from 0.675 inches to nearly one inch, which has played a significant role in improving both the output and quality of yarn. Domestic raw cotton can now be used to spin 42-count and 60-count high-grade yarn, and weave better fabrics, meeting the higher fabric demands of people in various regions. Currently, khaki, serge, poplin, and other fabrics with a wide market, as well as white and fine summer undershirts, are all spun and woven from high-quality raw cotton supplied by various regions. This situation has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the more than 100,000 textile workers in Shanghai. Shanghai textile workers are now working hard to improve the quality of yarn and fabrics, preparing to produce large quantities of inexpensive and high-quality fabrics for the people in accordance with the new standards for yarn and fabric quality formulated by the Central Textile Industry Department.

    各棉产区充分供应上海品质优良的原棉
    上海各纺织厂棉纱的产量和质量显著提高
    全国各棉产区供应我国纺织工业中心——上海的原棉，在品质和数量上都有显著的提高和增加。
    由于原棉供应情况的根本改变，今年上半年上海国营厂棉纱的产量已接近一九四九年全年产量。私营厂上半年的产量也比一九四九年同期增加了六成。解放前，因国产原棉质量低、产量少，以致解放初期的一九五一年上海各纺织厂曾因原棉供应不足而被迫停工一个半月。一九五二年由于原棉产量迅速增加，供应上海工业用棉的数量增加，对生产提供了充分的保证。在原棉质量方面也有了显著改进，解放前国产棉多是粗绒，纤维较短。加上中间贩运商掺水、掺杂、掺假、掺粗，更使原棉水分高、杂质多、纤维长短不齐，不适合作工业原料。解放以来，产棉区各级人民政府领导农民改良棉种，现在黄河流域出产的斯字棉，长江流域的德字棉和岱字棉不但纤维长而且细柔洁白，拉力极好。合作社在购棉中贯彻优级优价政策，促使农民按等按级售棉，不但根本改变了过去贩运商掺假的现象，而且棉花产品质量也大大提高了。据华东纺织纤维检验局的报告，目前各地原棉含水含杂已接近标准，有的还低于标准。
    在原棉供应充足和质量提高的基础上，上海棉纺织厂大量生产的二十支纱，所用原棉的纤维长度已从六点七五分提高到将近一吋，对于提高纱的产量和质量都起了很大作用。国产原棉已经可纺出四十二支和六十支的高级纱，织出更好的布，满足各地人民更高的用布要求。现在，市场上销路很广的卡其、哔叽、府绸等布匹和又白又细的夏季汗衫，都是由各地供应的质地优良的原棉纺织而成的。这一情况大大鼓舞了上海十余万纺织工人们的生产积极性。上海纺织工人们现正努力提高纱布品质，准备按照中央纺织工业部制定的纱布质量的新标准为人民生产大量物美价廉的布匹。
