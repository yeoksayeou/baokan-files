Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 30th: Soviet experts have played a significant role in the mechanization and automation movement at Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

Many important mechanization and automation suggestions put forward by the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have been realized under the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts. For example, after the successful creation of the automatic steel drawing machine in the small plant, the furnace bottom had to be improved before it could be used. However, this complex problem had not been solved by technicians and workers despite much effort. Later, with the help of Soviet expert Vasilyev, who was assisting Zhang Mingshan in creating the "anti-encircling disk," the furnace bottom was successfully transformed. The double lifting platform rolling mill created by Tang Fulin, assistant engineer of the First Sheet Steel Plant, was also successfully tested and modified by Soviet experts, who scientifically utilized an important piece of equipment that the original suggestion considered unusable, saving China a lot of money. This rolling mill will soon be manufactured. Once put into production, it will increase the output of thin steel sheets by 80% and reduce labor consumption by 80%, adding hundreds of billions of yuan to the country's wealth each year.

Soviet experts not only enthusiastically helped employees solve various technical difficulties, but also put forward many important suggestions for mechanization and automation. During the overhaul of the No. 2 blast furnace, Soviet experts proposed eleven mechanized construction suggestions, including steel rope conveyors, brick grinding machines, and movable hanging disks, and helped employees realize these suggestions from beginning to end. This not only ensured the quality of the overhaul, but also accelerated the speed of the overhaul work. When workers used these machines easily and safely at high altitudes or on the ground, they said happily: We are building with socialist methods! Soviet experts in iron smelting, steelmaking, primary rolling, power generation and other factories also proposed and helped realize many suggestions for mechanized production.

Soviet experts are the most enthusiastic encouragers in the mechanization and automation movement. When employees did not succeed in their experiments or encountered difficulties, Soviet experts always encouraged everyone with strong perseverance and faith. Many employees' creations were successful in overcoming difficulties under the encouragement of Soviet experts.

    苏联专家帮助鞍钢开展机械化自动化运动
    【新华社鞍山三十日电】苏联专家在鞍山钢铁公司的机械化自动化运动中，起了重大的作用。
    鞍钢职工提出许多重要的机械化自动化建议，都是在苏联专家的指导和帮助下实现的。如小型厂的自动抽钢机创造成功以后，必须改进炉底才能使用。但这个复杂的难题，技术人员和工人们花费了很多脑筋都没有解决。后来，在帮助张明山创造“反围盘”的苏联专家华西列也夫帮助下，才把炉底改造成功。第一薄板厂助理工程师汤富麟创造的双重升降台轧钢机，也是苏联专家帮助修改了原来的建议以及试验成功的，苏联专家并科学地利用了原建议认为不能利用的一项重要设备，为我国节省了大量的资金。这个轧钢机不久就可以制造出来，这个机器投入生产以后，将要使薄板厂的薄板产量提高百分之八十，使劳动力的消耗减少百分之八十，每年可为国家增加数百亿元的财富。
    苏联专家不仅热心地帮助职工解决各种技术上的困难，而且还提出了许多重要的机械化自动化的建议。在大修第二号炼铁炉时，苏联专家就提出了钢绳输送机、磨砖机、活动吊盘等十一件机械化施工的建议，并且有始有终地帮助职工实现了这些建议。不仅保证了检修质量，并且加快了检修工作的速度。工人们在高空或地面上轻松而安全的运用这些机械时，都高兴地说：咱们用社会主义的方法建设啦！在炼铁、炼钢、初轧、发电等厂的苏联专家，也提出并帮助实现了不少机械化生产的建议。
    苏联专家在机械化自动化运动中，是最热情的鼓舞者。在职工们没有试验成功或遇到困难时，苏联专家总是用坚强的毅力和信念来鼓励大家。许多职工的创造就是在苏联专家鼓舞下，克服困难得到成功的。
