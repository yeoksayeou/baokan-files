    Kailuan Mining Bureau's Zhao Gezhuang and Other Mines Do Not Pay Enough Attention to Improving Coal Quality
    Readers Jing Zhai, Liu Kai, and Guo Sheng write: The quality of coal produced by various mines under the Kailuan Mining Bureau is still very poor. On June 16, Zhao Gezhuang Mine under the Bureau allocated five truckloads of raw machine coal to the Tianjin Company of China Coal Construction Corporation. Because of the poor coal quality, lump coal accounted for only 30% after screening (under normal circumstances, lump coal should account for 60%). The Guye Transportation Station of Tianjin Coal Construction Corporation refused to accept it. On June 20, Zhao Gezhuang Mine allocated four truckloads of raw machine coal to the company, and the coal quality was even worse. The Guye Transportation Station refused to accept it again. The mine's staff not only did not humbly accept opinions and strive to improve coal quality, but instead treated the coal construction company's weighbridge supervisors with an unreasonable attitude. The Transportation Section Chief of Zhao Gezhuang Mine even said: "Whether you want it or not, this is the kind of coal; any coal can meet the standards." This batch of coal stayed at the station for 18 hours before the Guye Transportation Station agreed to accept it at the price of mixed coal (one grade lower than raw machine coal) after negotiation. On June 21, Zhao Gezhuang Mine allocated one truckload of coal to the Beidaihe Coal Construction Company for sale. Because there was too much coal dust, lump coal accounted for only 40%, and the buyer refused to accept it. The coal stayed at the station for three days. In addition, the No. 2 raw coal currently produced by Tangjiazhuang Mine under the Bureau contains about 25% to 30% gangue. The No. 2 raw coal currently produced by Linxi Mine also contains a large amount of old dross (hard coal). When the Coal Construction Company negotiated with them, they actually said: "Old dross is also coal."
    The above facts show that many coal mines under the Kailuan Mining Bureau do not pay enough attention to the instruction of "improving coal quality." It is recommended that the Coal Mine Management Bureau take effective measures to urge them to change this situation.

### 开滦矿务局所属赵各庄等矿对提高煤质的工作不够重视

专栏：读者来信摘要

    开滦矿务局所属赵各庄等矿对提高煤质的工作不够重视
    读者静斋、刘楷、国盛来信：开滦矿务局所属各矿产煤质量仍然十分低劣。六月十六日该局赵各庄矿调拨给中国煤建公司天津市公司机原煤五车，因为煤质低劣，过筛后块煤仅占百分之三十（正常的情况，块煤应占百分之六十）；天津煤建公司古冶运输站就拒绝接收。六月二十日，赵各庄矿调到该公司的四车机原煤，煤质更加低劣，古冶运输站又拒绝接收。该矿工作人员不但不虚心接受意见，努力提高煤质；相反地却以无理的态度对待煤建公司的监磅员。赵各庄矿运输科科长竟这样说：“要不要都是这种煤，凡是煤都能合规格。”这批煤在车站停留达十八小时，后来才经协商由古冶运输站按统煤价（比机原煤降一级）收下。六月二十一日赵各庄矿调给北戴河煤建公司供销售的煤炭一车，因煤末太多，块煤仅占百分之四十，买主拒收，煤炭在车站停留达三天之久。此外，该局唐家庄矿现在所产的二号原煤，含矸石量约占百分之二十五至三十。林西矿现在所产的二号原煤也含有大量老碴（硬煤）；煤建公司和他们交涉时，他们竟说：“老碴也是煤。”
    以上事实说明开滦矿务局所属不少煤矿对于“提高煤质”的指示还是不够重视的。建议煤矿管理总局采取有效措施督促他们改变这种情况。
