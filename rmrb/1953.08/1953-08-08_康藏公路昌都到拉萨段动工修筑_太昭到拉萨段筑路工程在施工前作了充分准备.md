Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 6th: Construction on the Qamdo to Lhasa section of the Kangzang Highway is actively underway, with work progressing eastward from Lhasa and westward from Qamdo in separate sections.

	Along the construction line, which stretches over 1,200 kilometers, tens of thousands of military personnel and civilian laborers are bravely battling the strong winds and heavy rains, and the treacherous mountains and rivers of the plateau. Many areas that were once uninhabited are now bustling construction sites, filled with joyful labor songs and the continuous roar of explosions. A large road-building team composed of Tibetan people has joined the construction of the Lhasa to Tai Zhao section. Road-building technicians from the interior of the motherland, who have come to help the Tibetan people build the border regions of the motherland, are also working hard to build roads and bridges amidst the towering mountains. Units of the People's Liberation Army of the Tibet Military Region, participating in road construction, also arrived at various construction sites before the start of work. In the western section of the project, people have already extended the highway from the valley area, which is more than 3,000 meters above sea level, to the snow-covered mountains. They plan to pass this desolate mountain, which is nearly a hundred miles long, before the mountain is blocked by ice and snow. The road-building army in the eastern section of the project has crossed the area blocked by heavy snow and is advancing rapidly into the Tanggula Mountains towards the dense forests.

	The Kangzang Highway is one of the highest highways in the world, and the construction is extremely difficult. The highway must cross many plateau torrents, pass through layers of Hengduan Mountains and primeval forests where the sun rarely shines, and requires digging through tens of miles of accumulated snow, solid ice, and frozen soil, and blasting countless hard rocks. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, with a high degree of patriotism, have fully mastered the technology of plateau road construction through more than two years of training. Under the call to build the border regions of the motherland, Tibetan and Han civilian laborers are also actively building roads with a high degree of labor enthusiasm. On the first day of entering the construction site, the soldiers made such vows: "Fill the thousand-year-old ditch, split the ten-thousand-year-old mountain, heroic road built by heroic people, no difficulties in front of heroes." Soldiers often undertake various difficult tasks in construction. Civilian laborers have also widely launched a "Unity and Patriotic Competition Movement." In their work, the soldiers also patiently teach various road-building techniques to Tibetan civilian laborers, increasing their work efficiency by one and a half to two times in two months. Now many Tibetan civilian laborers have learned the technology of building open and covered culverts.

	The construction of the Kangzang Highway has received active support from the Tibetan local government, people from all walks of life in Tibet, and the broad masses of monks and laypeople. The Dalai Lama of the Tibetan local government ordered monks and lay officials of all Zong and Xika to vigorously support the construction of the Kangzang Highway and called on the Tibetan people to actively participate in road construction. The Tibetan local government also appointed Kalon Sokan Wangqing Geler, Kanjiong Tengba, Daiben Xiajiang Suba, Luoru Langjie, and Kezhong Maya and other monks and lay officials to participate in the leadership at all levels of construction and Zong and Xika also sent officials and headmen to lead the road construction workers. The Qamdo District People's Liberation Committee also established a special committee to support the construction of the Kangzang Highway to lead the work of material supply, equipment transportation, and so on. This spring, nearly 20,000 yaks and mules were organized to participate in transportation, ensuring the timely supply of materials.

	Tibetan local government officials and Tibetan people participating in the leadership of the construction work are actively responsible in their work. They often brave the wind and rain to inspect the work on the construction site. Before the start of construction, Daiben Xiajiang Suba personally went to each Zong to gather civilian laborers and promoted the benefits of building the Kangzang Highway to the Tibetan people. Before construction even started, he moved to a construction site more than 4,000 meters above sea level with a cold climate to prepare for the start of construction. Some officials and headmen have been rated as models and have been rewarded. Residents of large and small villages or pastures near the various construction areas voluntarily vacated part of their houses and tents for the road construction personnel to live in, sold fresh vegetables, butter and other foods, and often helped the road construction personnel solve various difficulties.
   Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 5th: Full preparations were made for the construction of the Tai Zhao to Lhasa section of the Kangzang Highway before the start of construction. As early as this spring, the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Tibetan local government jointly established the Kangzang Highway Construction Committee and construction leading organizations at all levels, and specifically formulated construction plans for each section. The Central People's Government and the transportation departments under the Southwest Administrative Committee dispatched a large number of engineering and technical personnel to conduct various surveys in various sections. The Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army also transferred a group of cadres and soldiers from various departments who had experience in plateau road construction and had undergone short-term specialized engineering and technical training to various construction sites to specifically solve the difficulties encountered by civilian laborers in construction. At the same time, tens of thousands of Tibetan civilian laborers from more than 40 Zong and Xika also gathered at designated locations one after another before the start of construction. The Tibetan civilian laborers had prepared tents, clothing, shoes, and various tools in advance, forming a well-equipped road construction army.

	Thousands of tons of road-building equipment and materials were also continuously transported to various construction sites. In order to ensure the supply of daily necessities for civilian laborers during road construction, the state-owned trading departments in Tibet also prepared a large amount of butter, tea, salt, towels, soap and other materials, and sent cadres to set up mobile material supply stations in various construction areas, and sold them at cost, which was 10% to 20% lower than the local market price, which was welcomed by the Tibetan civilian laborers. Health clinics and convalescent homes have also been set up in various construction areas, and civilian laborers who are sick can receive timely and patient treatment or be hospitalized for recuperation.

	Before construction, the Kangzang Highway Construction Committee also formulated political teaching materials for civilian laborers to help them study. The Political Department of the Tibet Military Region has distributed pre-prepared picture books and films to various construction sites, and sent cultural troupes and film projection teams to perform programs and films popular with the Tibetan people in various construction areas.

    康藏公路昌都到拉萨段动工修筑
    太昭到拉萨段筑路工程在施工前作了充分准备
    【新华社拉萨六日电】康藏公路昌都到拉萨段，正由拉萨向东、昌都向西分段动工，积极修筑中。
    在长达一千二百多公里的施工线上，成千上万的军工和民工正冒着阵阵的大风猛雨，和高原上的险山恶水进行顽强的斗争。许多过去荒无人烟的地带，现在变成了千万工人施工的现场，整日响着愉快的劳动歌声，轰鸣着连续不断的爆破声。一支由藏族人民组成的浩大的筑路大队，已经参加了拉萨至太昭段的筑路工程。由祖国内地前来帮助藏族人民建设祖国边疆的筑路技术工人，也正在丛山峻岭间紧张地筑路架桥。中国人民解放军西藏军区参加筑路的部队，也在开工前赶到各个施工地点。在西段工程中，人们已经把公路从拔海三千多公尺的河谷地带，延伸到常年飘着雪花的山间，他们计划在冰雪封山以前修过这座上下近百里的荒山。东段工程中的筑路大军，已经越过了大雪封山的地带，把公路修进了唐古拉山区，正向森林茂密的地区疾进。
    康藏公路是世界上修筑在最高地带的一条公路，修筑工程的艰巨也很罕见。公路必须跨过许多高原激流，穿过层层横断山脉和常年不见天日的原始森林，还需要挖开十多里到几十里的积雪、坚冰和冻土，爆炸无数坚硬的岩石。具有高度爱国主义精神的人民解放军的战士们，经过两年多来的高原筑路锻炼，已经充分掌握了高原筑路的技术。藏族、汉族民工们在建设祖国边疆的号召下，也怀着高度的劳动热情积极筑路。部队战士们进入工地的第一天，就发出了这样的誓言：“填平千年沟，劈开万年山，英雄的公路英雄们修，英雄面前没有困难。”战士们在施工中常常担负着各种艰难任务。民工们也普遍展开了“团结爱国竞赛运动”。在工作中，战士们还耐心地把各种筑路技术教给藏族民工，使他们的工作效率在两个月内提高了一倍半到两倍。现在许多藏族民工已经学会了修筑明渠暗涵的技术。
    康藏公路在修筑中受到西藏地方政府、西藏各阶层人士和广大僧俗人民的积极支援。西藏地方政府达赖喇嘛曾下令所属各宗和溪卡的僧俗官员大力支援康藏公路的修筑，并号召藏族人民积极参加筑路工作。西藏地方政府并指派噶伦索康·旺钦格来、堪穷藤巴、代本夏江苏巴、罗如朗杰、科仲马雅等僧俗官员，参加各级施工领导机构，各宗和溪卡也派出了带领修路民工的官员和头人。昌都地区人民解放委员会也专门成立了支援修筑康藏公路的委员会，领导物资供应、器材运输等工作。今年春天，组织参加运输的牦牛、骡马将近两万头，保证了物资的及时供应。
    参加施工领导工作的西藏地方政府官员和藏族人士们，在工作中积极负责。他们时常冒着风雨烈日到工地上检查工作。代本夏江苏巴在开工前就亲自到各宗集中民工，向人民宣传修筑康藏公路对西藏人民的好处。还没有开工前，他就搬到拔海四千多公尺气候寒冷的某工地上住宿，筹划开工事宜。有些官员和头人已经被评为模范，受到了奖励。各个施工地区附近的大小村寨或牧场的居民们，自动地把自己的房子和帐篷让出一部分给修路人员居住，出售新鲜蔬菜、酥油等食品，并经常帮助筑路人员解决各种困难问题。
   【新华社拉萨五日电】康藏公路太昭到拉萨段筑路工程，在施工前曾进行了充分的准备。早在今年春天，中国人民解放军西藏军区和西藏地方政府就联合成立了康藏公路修建委员会和各级施工领导机构，具体拟订了各个工段的施工计划。中央人民 政府和西南行政委员会所属交通部门派遣了大批的工程技术人员，到各个工段进行各种勘测工作。人民解放军西藏军区，也从各部抽调出一批有高原修路经验，并经过短期专门工程技术学习的干部和战士们分赴各个工地，具体解决民工在施工中发生的困难问题。同时，来自四十多个宗和溪卡的成千上万的藏族民工，也在开工前先后在指定地点集结。藏族民工们事先都准备好了帐篷、衣服、鞋子和各种工具，组成了一支装备齐全的修路大军。
    数以千吨计的筑路器材和物资也源源不断地载运到各个施工地点。为了保证民工在修路期间生活必需品的供应，在西藏的国营贸易部门也准备了大量的酥油、茶叶、食盐、毛巾、肥皂等物资，并派出干部在各个施工地区设立流动物资供应站，并按成本出售，比当地市价减低百分之十到二十，受到藏族民工的欢迎。卫生治疗所和休养院也在各个工区设立起来，民工生了病，都能及时得到医务人员耐心的治疗或住院休养。
    施工前，康藏公路修建委员会还拟订了民工政治教材，帮助民工们学习。西藏军区政治部已将预先准备好的画报和影片分送到各个工地上去，并派出文工队、电影放映队在各个施工地区巡回演出藏族人民喜好的节目和电影。
