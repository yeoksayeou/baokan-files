    After Learning from the Work Experience of the Quzhai Village Branch
    ——The Transformation of the CPC Pingshun Beiganquan Village Branch
    Diao Xingjie, Yao Tiancang

    In May of this year, after the CPC Pingshun County Beiganquan Village Branch studied the work experience of the Changzhi Quzhai Village Branch, the work of the Beiganquan Village Branch greatly improved.

    Before learning the work experience of the Quzhai Branch, some people had the following two incorrect ideas because they did not understand the purpose and role of learning the work experience of the Quzhai Branch: one was represented by the branch secretary Wang Caoxi. He said: "When I studied at the Party School, I listened to Comrade Gou Peifang's report. She is really capable; our branch secretary cannot compare with her. I have little ability and low education. I can't even read a peasant newspaper. It's useless to learn this experience." The other was represented by Wang Changfa, the branch's organization member, who opposed learning the work experience of the Quzhai Village Branch to the current central work. He said: "Now we are busy with production, correcting the blind and rash advances in mutual aid and cooperation, and eliminating illiteracy. It's too busy, let's learn it in winter!" After the higher party committee discovered these ideological situations, it specifically led the branch committee members to study the "Instructions on Promoting the Work Experience of the Quzhai Party Branch" of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, and used specific examples to illustrate that learning the work experience of the Quzhai Village Branch was precisely to do a good job in the central work. After the branch committee members understood the purpose and role of learning, they also discovered the shortcomings and errors in their work. Branch committee member Guan Maosong said: "Society is advancing every day, but our leadership methods are still old-fashioned. If we don't learn from other people's experiences, we will not be able to keep up with the development of society." "Comrade Gou Peifang has strong abilities and can create experience. Our abilities are low, as long as we learn from other people's experiences, we can also do a good job." On such an ideological basis, the branch committee members seriously studied the work experience of the Quzhai Village Branch.

    Strengthening Ideological Education Work

    One of the problems in the work of the Beigan Village Branch was the lack of ideological education work for party members and the masses. When party members and the masses had shortcomings and mistakes, they often adopted the method of reprimanding instead of education. As a result, some branch committee members stood in opposition to the masses, and branch committee member Shen Shouzhen (village head) was one of them. He was arrogant, looked down on people, and many party members and the masses were somewhat afraid of him. When Shen Shouzhen presided over meetings, no one wanted to arrive first; everyone obviously had opinions, but no one dared to raise them. The branch committee did not criticize and educate Shen Shouzhen on these erroneous styles, but adopted an attitude of appeasement. Wang Changde, the branch's organization member, said: "He has ways to do his work, let him do it alone!" When learning the work experience of the Quzhai Branch, after learning the experience of "taking improving the quality of party members as the primary task" and "overcoming the work style of monopolizing everything and commandism, and establishing the work method of the mass line," everyone conducted a review of the above-mentioned problems. Shen Shouzhen also sincerely reviewed himself. He said: "Comrade Gou Peifang sees who has shortcomings and mistakes, understands their thinking, finds the reasons, and persuades and educates them; but when I see who has shortcomings and mistakes, I criticize and attack them. This is only harmful and not beneficial to the work." Shen Shouzhen expressed his determination to overcome this erroneous ideological style and was very confident. He said: "Since a communist party member is determined to serve the people for life, can't these shortcomings and mistakes be overcome?" Branch Secretary Wang Caoxi also said: "Comrade Gou Peifang's work experience tells us that a communist party member must have a good ideological style; otherwise, he will turn good things into bad things." Under the method of learning, reviewing, and correcting at the same time, everyone's ideological style has undergone a significant change. Everyone not only attached importance to ideological education for party members and the masses, but also considered the issue of education methods. For those who were depressed due to excessive criticism in the past, the branch committee members tried to inspire their enthusiasm and commended those who worked actively. With the change of the ideological style of the branch committee members, the democratic atmosphere within the party also increased compared with the past. Party member Jia Zhongxin dared to criticize the past undemocratic phenomena of the branch committee members, and said: "In the past, the branch committee members only gave tasks to party members, but did not give them methods; the active ones were not praised, and the backward ones were criticized so much that they could not hold their heads up." Party members and the masses generally reflected: "Since the branch committee studied Gou Peifang's work experience, the branch's leadership style has changed."

    Overcoming the Impatience and Rash Advance Emotions in Mutual Aid and Cooperation

    In the process of learning from the work experience of the Quzhai Village Branch, the Beiganquan Branch Committee checked out that the emotions of impatience and rash advance in the work of mutual aid and cooperation were more serious. Last winter, without asking whether the masses were willing or not, all eleven mutual aid groups in the village were merged into six large groups, each with about thirty households. Except for two groups with a better foundation that did not need to be corrected, the remaining four groups were large groups encompassing small groups, and there were individual households within the small groups. Everyone's production enthusiasm was not high. The method of correction was as follows: the relevant cadres first reviewed their impatience and rash advance emotions at the mass meeting, especially the idea of "emphasizing the society and neglecting the groups," and guaranteed that they would not make such mistakes in the future. Finally, on the basis of the masses' conscious and voluntary basis, the four large groups were reorganized into eight small groups. The division of labor among the branch committee members was also reconsidered; it was decided that in the future, in addition to Branch Secretary Wang Caoxi leading the agricultural production cooperative, the remaining ten branch committee members would be responsible for leading the mutual aid groups in the village. The branch committee meeting should not only discuss the affairs of the agricultural production cooperative, but also discuss the production problems of the mutual aid groups and individual households. Because the branch committee attached importance to ideological leadership, other problems in mutual aid and cooperation were also gradually resolved, so everyone's production enthusiasm increased. During the summer planting, within a short period of five days, the whole village planted 451 mu of corn and 397 mu of millet, and accepted technical guidance and improved farming methods.

    Giving Play to the Role of the Propaganda Network

    After learning from the work experience of the Quzhai Village Branch, the Beiganquan Branch Committee realized that the Party's propaganda work is the vanguard of all work and an effective weapon to overcome coercion and commandism. Therefore, it conducted a review and reorganization of the Party's propaganda work in the village. Although there were 21 propagandists and 15 newspaper reading groups in the village, the Party branch did not fully understand the role of the propaganda network organization, and therefore relaxed its leadership over propaganda work, especially failing to make propaganda work serve production. Therefore, although some propaganda work had been carried out, the content of propaganda was very poor. In this regard, Branch Secretary Wang Caoxi and Branch Propaganda Committee Member Jia Huanzhen both made self-criticisms. In order to strengthen the leadership of propaganda work, the branch committee decided that Deputy Branch Secretary Shen Kaiji and Propaganda Committee Member Jia Huanzhen would jointly be responsible for leading the propaganda work, so that propaganda work could better serve production. The reorganized propaganda network organization of Beiganquan Village became unprecedentedly active during the tense spring plowing production. The radio station, newspaper reading groups, and blackboard newspapers publicized production experiences and current news, which were warmly welcomed by the masses and encouraged and promoted the production work of the whole village.

    学习了璩寨村支部工作经验以后
    ——中共平顺北甘泉村支部工作的转变
    刁星洁、姚天仓
    今年五月间，中共平顺县北甘泉村支部学习了长治璩寨村支部工作经验以后，北甘泉村支部工作有了很大的改进。
    在学习璩寨支部工作经验之前，有些人因为对学习璩寨支部工作经验的目的和作用不了解，曾有以下两种错误思想：一种是以支部书记王曹喜为代表的。他说：“咱在党校学习时听过苟佩芳同志的报告，人家真有本事；咱这个支部书记就不能和人家比，能力小、文化低，连份农民报也读不下，学了这个经验也没用。”一种是以支部组织委员王长发为代表的，把学习璩寨村支部工作经验和当前的中心工作对立起来，他说：“现在又是生产，又是纠正互助合作工作上的盲目冒进，又是扫除文盲，实在忙不过来，到冬季学吧！”上级党委发觉了这些思想情况后，就具体领导支部委员学习了中共山西省委的“关于推广璩寨党支部工作经验的指示”，并用具体的事例说明了学习璩寨村支部工作经验正是为了做好中心工作。支部委员在懂得学习的目的与作用后，也就发现了自己工作上的缺点与错误。支部委员关茂松说：“现在社会天天在前进，可是咱的领导方法还是老一套，如不好好学习人家的经验，就跟不上社会的发展了。”“苟佩芳同志能力强，能够创造经验，咱的能力低，只要好好学习人家的经验，也能够把工作做好。”在这样的思想基础上，支部委员认真地学习璩寨村支部工作经验了。
    加强思想教育工作
    北甘村支部工作中的问题之一，是对党员对群众缺乏思想教育工作，在党员、群众有缺点和错误时，常常是采取训斥的办法，而不是采取教育的办法。因而有些支部委员就和群众对立起来，支部委员申守珍（村长）就是其中的一个。他目空一切，瞧不起人，许多党员和群众见了他就有些惧怕。申守珍主持会议时，谁也不愿先到会；大家明明有意见，但都不敢提出来。支委会对申守珍这些错误作风，并没有给予批评教育，而是采取姑息迁就的态度。支部组织委员王长德就说：“他工作上有办法，叫他一个人干吧！”在学习璩寨支部工作经验时，学到“把提高党员的质量当作首要工作去做”、“克服了包办代替与命令主义的作风，树立了群众路线的工作方法”的经验后，大家针对上述问题进行了检查。申守珍也诚恳地检讨了自己。他说：“人家苟佩芳同志看见谁有缺点、错误，是摸思想，找原因，进行说服教育；但是我看见谁有缺点、错误，就是批评打击。这样对工作只有害处没有好处。”申守珍表示决心克服这种错误的思想作风，并且很有信心。他说：“一个共产党员既然确定终身为人民服务，难道这些缺点错误还不能克服吗？”支部书记王曹喜也说：“苟佩芳同志的工作经验告诉咱们，一个共产党员得有好的思想作风；否则，会把好事办成坏事。”在边学习、边检讨、边改正的方法之下，大家的思想作风有了显著的转变，大家不仅重视了对党员、群众进行思想教育的工作，而且还考虑到教育方法问题。对过去因受批评过多而情绪消沉的人，支部委员就设法启发这些人的积极性，表扬其中积极工作的人。随着支部委员的思想作风的转变，党内的民主空气也较前增长。党员贾忠信敢于针对支部委员过去的不民主现象，提出批评，并说：“过去支部委员光给党员任务，不给党员办法；积极的得不到表扬，落后的被批评得抬不起头来。”党员、群众普遍反映：“自从支委会学习了苟佩芳的工作经验之后，支部的领导作风变了样子。”
    克服了互助合作中的急躁冒进情绪
    在学习璩寨村支部工作经验中，北甘泉支委会检查出在互助合作工作中的急躁冒进情绪较为严重。去年冬天，不问群众愿意不愿意，即将全村十一个互助组合并为六个大组，每组都在三十户左右，除了两个组基础较好不需要纠正外，其余四个组是大组套小组、小组里面还有单干户，大家的生产劲头都不大。纠正的办法是这样，由有关的干部首先在群众大会上检讨了自己的急躁冒进情绪，尤其是“重社轻组”的思想，保证今后不再犯这样的错误。最后在群众自觉自愿的基础上将四个大组改编成八个小组。又重新考虑了支部委员之间的分工问题；决定今后除支部书记王曹喜领导农业生产合作社外，其余十个支委分工领导全村的互助组。支委开会不仅要讨论农业生产合作社的事情，同时要讨论互助组和单干户的生产问题。由于支委会重视了思想领导，互助合作中的其他问题也逐一得到了解决，因而大家的生产劲头大了。夏种期间，在短短的五天内，全村种完了四百五十一亩玉茭，三百九十七亩谷子，而且接受了技术指导，改进了耕作方法。
    发挥了宣传网的作用
    在学习璩寨村支部工作经验以后，北甘泉支委会体会到：党的宣传工作是一切工作的开路先锋，是克服强迫命令的有效武器，因此对本村的党的宣传工作作了一番检查与整理。全村虽有二十一名宣传员，十五个读报组，但由于党支部对宣传网组织的作用认识不足，因而放松了对宣传工作的领导，特别是没有使宣传工作为生产服务。因此，虽然也进行过一些宣传工作，但宣传内容非常贫乏。对此，支部书记王曹喜、支部宣传委员贾焕珍都作了检讨。为了加强对宣传工作的领导，支委会决定支部副书记申开基与宣传委员贾焕珍等共同负责领导宣传工作，使宣传工作更好地为生产服务。经过整理后的北甘泉村宣传网组织，在紧张的春耕生产中空前的活跃起来了。广播台、读报组、黑板报宣传了生产经验及时事新闻，受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎，鼓舞和推动了全村的生产工作。
