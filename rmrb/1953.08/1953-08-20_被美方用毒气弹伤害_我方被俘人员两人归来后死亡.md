Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 19th. Two Korean People's Army prisoners of war, Yu Zhengzhi and Han Rongzhu, who were injured by US poison gas, have died after returning, despite medical treatment. They passed away on the 14th and 17th respectively. Kim Kyung-shik and Li Zaiying are also in critical condition.

Yu Zhengzhi was already unconscious when the US side handed him over to the Korean-Chinese side at noon on the 14th. He was immediately sent to the hospital for emergency treatment, but died at 2 p.m. that day due to severe poisoning and ineffective treatment. An autopsy by doctors proved that the deceased had suppurative inflammation and necrosis of the mucous membranes of the trachea and bronchi after poisoning, as well as severe pulmonary edema, causing bronchopneumonia, resulting in breathing difficulties and heart failure. Han Rongzhu's symptoms were the same as Yu Zhengzhi's. Parts of both men's bodies were burned. Yu Zhengzhi was the most severely injured, with two-thirds of his skin burned; Han Rongzhu's face and left shoulder were also blistered and peeling.

Yu Zhengzhi, Han Rongzhu, and others were originally in the US 15th Prisoner of War Camp on Geoje Island. On August 10th, before their repatriation, the US side ordered them to remove the collars from their Korean People's Army uniform shirts before they were allowed to leave the prisoner of war camp. The People's Army prisoners of war did not accept this absurd and insulting order. Thereupon, the US military authorities mobilized a company of troops to surround the prisoner of war camp, closed the doors and windows, and threw a large number of poison gas bombs inside. Major Bastholt Oluton, the commander of the 15th Prisoner of War Camp, personally threw poison gas bombs. According to Wu Xilong, a returning prisoner who was less severely poisoned, he saw a type of poison gas bomb that exploded on the ground, emitting yellow smoke; another type of poison gas bomb exploded in mid-air, spraying yellow powder that could burn the human body upon contact with the skin. In this incident, 600 prisoners of war in the second camp of the 15th Prisoner of War Camp on Geoje Island were poisoned to varying degrees. On the evening of the 10th and the 11th, Xi Kui, Liang Zaiyu, Jin Yongxi, Cui Longshan, Xu Rong and others died.

There are currently 19 Korean People's Army returnees who were poisoned in this incident receiving treatment at the Kaesong Hospital. They all have burns on their bodies and symptoms such as difficulty breathing, hoarseness, keratitis, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, blurred vision, and enlarged livers. Among them, Kim Kyung-shik and Li Zaiying are the most seriously injured.

In order to cover up their crime of using poison gas on prisoners of war, the American prisoner of war camp authorities often refer to the poison gas bombs they release as "non-toxic irritants." However, according to the examination of the poisoned returnees by Korean-Chinese doctors, it has been proven that the US military used highly toxic poison gas bombs on the prisoners of war, which were enough to cause the poisoned to die. The US side must not cover up this serious crime of violating international law and killing prisoners of war.

    被美方用毒气弹伤害
    我方被俘人员两人归来后死亡
    【新华社开城十九日电】被美军用毒气弹伤害的朝鲜人民军被俘人员归来后，已有于正植、韩荣洙两人医治无效，在十四日和十七日先后死去。金景植、李在应二人也在垂危中。
    于正植在十四日中午美方交给朝中方面的时候已经昏迷不醒。他被立即送入医院急救，但因中毒沉重，救治无效，于当日下午二时死去。经医生解剖，证明死者中毒后气管和枝气管的粘膜有化脓性炎症及坏死和发生高度肺水肿，并引起枝气管性肺炎，以致呼吸困难，心脏衰竭而死。韩荣洙的症状和于正植相同。两人的身体表面部分都有灼伤，于正植最严重，全身有三分之二的皮肤被灼伤；韩荣洙的脸部、左肩也被烧起泡、脱皮。
    于正植、韩荣洙等原在巨济岛美方第十五号战俘营，八月十日临遣返前，美方命令他们要将朝鲜人民军军服衬衣上的衣领拆掉，才准离开战俘营。人民军被俘人员不接受这种荒谬的、侮辱性的命令。于是美军当局就调动了一个连的兵力包围战俘营，把门窗都关闭起来，向里面投掷大量毒气弹。十五号战俘营长官美军少校巴斯霍特·吴鲁顿也亲自投掷毒气弹。据中毒较轻的归来人员吴熙龙说，他当时曾看到一种落地爆炸的毒气弹，冒黄烟；另一种毒气弹在半空中爆炸，喷出黄色粉末，沾着皮肤就能灼伤人体。在这次事件中，巨济岛十五号战俘营第二营场的六百名战俘都中了不同程度的毒。在十日晚和十一日，就有锡奎、梁在玉、金永熙、崔龙善、许荣等多人死去。
    在这次事件里中毒的朝鲜人民军归来人员现在还有十九人在开城医院中医治，他们身上都被灼伤，并有呼吸困难、嗄声、角膜炎、结膜炎、腹泻、视力障碍、肝脏胀大等症状。其中伤势最严重的是金景植、李在应二人。
    美国战俘营当局为了掩盖它们对战俘使用毒气弹的罪恶，常把它们施放的毒气弹称为“无毒刺激物”，但根据朝中医生对中毒归来人员的检验，证明美军向战俘使用了毒性猛烈的足以招致中毒者死亡的毒气弹。美方决不能掩盖它这种违反国际公法、残杀战俘的严重罪行。
