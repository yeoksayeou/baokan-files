    Transferred Revolutionary Soldier Huo Chengzhen Rescued a Mutual Aid Team on the Verge of Collapse
    Reader Zhao Ren wrote: Huo Chengzhen, a transferred soldier from Sidaizi Village, Yongji County, Jilin Province, rescued a mutual aid team that was on the verge of collapse. Huo Chengzhen joined the People's Liberation Army in April 1948 and served as a platoon leader in a certain unit. In June of this year, he responded to the call of the motherland and transferred to participate in production. He returned to his hometown from the army, and after only two days of rest, he joined the work of the mutual aid team. The land of the mutual aid team he joined was, because of excessive rain this year, a scene of weeds indistinguishable from seedlings. The team members were all dejected, and their production morale was very low. The mutual aid team was about to collapse. After understanding this situation, he went deep into the team to discuss with his comrades, helped them eliminate ideological obstacles, and formulated a plan for weeding and rescuing seedlings, mobilizing both male and female labor within the team to participate in summer hoeing. He also learned that two families in the team were short of food, so he discussed with the team members who were in better circumstances and lent grain to those two families to solve their difficulties. Fearing that the team's labor force could not solve the problem of wasteland, he took out a portion of his pension and hired more than forty temporary workers to participate in the rescue work. By July 20th, the summer hoeing work of their team was basically completed, and the seedlings on more than eight hectares of land in the whole team had turned a tender green color, no longer indistinguishable from weeds. Thanks to his persuasion, education, and exemplary actions, the team members' confidence in production is rising day by day, and they are now carrying out the work of pulling flax and accumulating fertilizer. He not only consolidated his own mutual aid team but also deposited three million yuan of his pension into the credit department of the village cooperative, solving the difficulties of more than twenty other grain-deficient households and playing a significant role in production. The villagers reflected: Huo Chengzhen is truly a person educated by Chairman Mao!

专栏：读者来信摘要

    转业革命军人霍成珍抢救了要垮台的互助组
    读者昭人来信：吉林省永吉县四台子村转业军人霍成珍，抢救了要垮台的互助组。霍成珍于一九四八年四月参加解放军，曾任过某部排长。今年六月里，他响应祖国号召，转业参加生产。他由部队回到家乡，才休息两天就参加了互助组的工作。他参加的那个互助组的地，因为今年雨水过多，有的弄得荒成一片，苗草不分。组员们都垂头丧气，生产情绪很坏。互助组就要垮台。他了解了这情况，便深入组内和同志们商量，帮助同志们打消了思想上的阻碍，并订出了铲草、抢救禾苗的计划，动员组内男女劳动力都参加夏锄工作。另外了解到组内有两家缺吃的，他又和情况较好的组员们商量，借粮给那两家解决了困难。还恐怕组内的劳动力解决不了荒地问题，他把自己得到的抚恤金拿出一部分，请了四十多个临时工参加抢救工作。七月二十日，他们组的夏锄工作基本结束，全组八垧多地的禾苗，已呈现出嫩绿的颜色，不再是草苗不分了。由于他的说服教育和模范行动，组员们的生产信心日益高涨，现在正进行拔亚麻和积肥等工作。他把自己一个互助组搞得巩固起来，还把他的抚恤金三百万元存入村中合作社的信用部，解决了另外二十多家缺粮户的困难，在生产上起了重大作用。老乡们反映：霍成珍真是毛主席教育出来的人呵！
