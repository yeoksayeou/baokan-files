    Strengthening the Custody Work in Grain Transportation

    Editor's Note: Recently, we have received many letters from readers exposing the irresponsibility of certain transportation units in grain transportation work, resulting in serious losses to state property. This is a problem that deserves attention. In order to ensure the grain supply to large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas, and to regulate market needs, a large amount of grain must be transported over long distances in the future. Therefore, doing a good job in the custody of grain during transportation—preventing rain, leakage, moisture, and ensuring ventilation—is a very important task. The departments responsible for transportation and the grain departments must cooperate to complete it. Now we have selected some abstracts of readers' letters for publication below, hoping that relevant units will promptly conduct inspections and take effective measures to prevent further losses of grain during transportation.

    Grain Departments and Transportation Departments Should Jointly Do a Good Job in the Custody of Grain Transportation

    Han Baoxiang from the Xibianmen Warehouse of the Beijing Company of China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation writes: In early June, a large quantity of polished rice shipped from Yudaimen Station by the Wuhan Grain Company to our warehouse was soaked by rain. For example, out of 326 bags of grain loaded in freight car No. 50591, 205 bags were damp. After ventilation and sorting by our warehouse, a portion of the grain was salvaged, but 6,700 jin had changed color and taste, and more than 100 jin were moldy and inedible. In mid-June, flour and wheat shipped to our warehouse from the Baotou Grain Company and the Dongchangshou Warehouse of Xinle County Grain Bureau were also found to have suffered losses due to gaps in the car roofs and flimsy tarpaulins. For example, freight car No. 330240 was casually covered with an old tarpaulin, resulting in 272 bags of wheat being soaked by rainwater. More seriously, water accumulated at the bottom of the car, submerging a layer of grain bags, and some wheat grains had swelled and sprouted.

    The above are just a few examples, and similar accidents are still happening constantly. It is suggested that all railway bureaus pay attention to moisture prevention during transportation in the rainy season, and leaking freight cars must be repaired or covered with oilcloth before being loaded. All grain-shipping units should also take a responsible attitude towards the people's property and carefully check the cars and tarpaulins for possible rain leaks before shipping grain. In short, both parties should work together to do a good job in the custody of grain during long-distance transportation.

    Grain Mold and Deterioration Accidents Frequently Occur in Grain Transportation by Railways in Various Places

    Ma Zhen from the Storage and Transportation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government writes: Currently, accidents frequently occur in grain transportation by railways in various places. In May, out of one million jin of rice transported from Wenjiazhen, Jiangxi to Xi'an, more than 50,000 jin were moldy, and another 887 jin were completely deteriorated. Out of four million jin of rice transported from Nanchang to Xi'an, more than 126,000 jin had changed taste, more than 1,300 jin were completely moldy, and 51 grain sacks were damaged, resulting in a total loss of more than 20 million yuan. Out of 31 cars of paddy rice transferred from Nanning, Guangxi to Tianjin, more than 100 bags had sprouted. A lot of the grain transferred from within the customs to the Northeast is also moldy and hairy. Recently, the amount of grain transferred from various places to Beijing that is heating up and deteriorating is particularly alarming; just the flour soaked by rain amounted to more than 11,000 bags, with an estimated loss of over 100 million yuan. I believe that railway bureaus in various places should pay special attention to the custody of grain during long-distance transportation during the current rainy season, and correct this phenomenon that seriously damages the interests of the state.

    Trains Frequently Drop Transported Grain and Other Items Along the Hengyang-Dapu Railway Section

    Ding Zhengfeng from the Tonggang Complete Primary School in Hengnan County writes: On the morning of June 9, when students Luo Jida, Chen Xiangmei, Luo Jilan, and others from the Caichong Township Primary School in the Third District of Hengnan County, Hunan Province, were going to school, they found a large sack full of millet (estimated weight of about 150 jin) next to the railway (section from Hengyang to Dapu). A tofu seller ran over and wanted to take the millet away, but the children stopped him and said, "This is something that fell from the train, it is state property, and we should hand it over to the government." So they guarded the sack of millet and sent one person to quickly report to the Caichong Township People's Government. Only after the Township People's Government sent someone to take the millet away did these primary school students go to school.

    The behavior of these primary school students in cherishing state property is commendable. However, the railway's handling of transported goods is too irresponsible. According to my understanding, trains frequently drop coal, millet, and other items along this railway section. It is suggested that the loading and unloading personnel at each station package the goods with a highly responsible spirit to avoid losses to the people's property.

    Railway Bureaus Should Check Cars and Tarpaulins Before Carrying Grain

    Wu Yongchun from the Grain Transportation Committee of the Meihekou Railway Sub-bureau of the Jilin Railway Administration writes: Recently, various stations in Liaodong Province have discovered serious mold and deterioration of rice and flour transported from within the customs. For example, rice transported from Yudaimen Station in Wuhan to Liaoyuan, Linjiang, and Dalizi in Liaodong Province, according to statistics, more than 1,000 bags were soaked by rainwater, of which more than 80,000 jin of rice had deteriorated, and about 4,700 jin of moldy and inedible rice, plus losses of sacks, etc., amounted to a total loss of more than 47 million yuan in Renminbi; the situation of flour being soaked by rainwater is also very serious. There are many similar accidents, which cannot be listed one by one.

    The main reason for these losses is that the sending stations are irresponsible in their grain transportation work. For example, stations such as Yudaimen, Hankou, and Jiamusi often use leaking cars and tarpaulins to transport rice and flour. I saw a tarpaulin covering a freight car at Liaoyuan Station, which had many holes, the largest of which was 3 centimeters long and 1 centimeter wide; and many broken openings had been sewn with hemp thread, but had not been smeared with tung oil, so they were still prone to rain leakage. For example, one car loaded with rice from Yudaimen to Liaoyuan had a one-centimeter-wide gap at the car door and around the bottom edge, and rainwater seeped in from the gap, thus wetting the rice near the bottom layer. In addition, there were leaks on the roof of a covered car, and several small holes around it.

    In order to avoid the continued occurrence of grain damage due to moisture, each grain sending station should pay strict attention to rain protection work during the rainy season. Before loading, the railway and the shipper should best inspect the cars once. If both parties deem it qualified, then load the car. Strong and sturdy tarpaulins must be used to cover grain cars; after broken tarpaulins have been mended, they must be smeared with tung oil to prevent rain leakage.

    Mold Accidents Occur in Grain Transport by Sea Vessels Under the South China Shipping Administration Bureau

    Xu Ximing from the Political Department of the South China Shipping Administration Bureau writes: The South China Shipping Administration Bureau's Hai Nan No. 162 vessel once carried about 2,850,000 kilograms of grain from the Qinzhou Prefecture Grain Bureau to Haikou. When loading the hold, the porters found that the humidity of this batch of grain was very high, and it was prone to mold in transportation, and they raised their concerns to the management personnel of the Maritime Administration Bureau, but the management personnel did not adopt them. When the ship arrived in Haikou, it was found that more than 1,300 bags (100 kilograms per bag) of grain had completely rotted and deteriorated.

    Another Hai Nan No. 174 vessel under the Bureau once carried rice, but because the water in the bottom of the hold was not cleared, the rice was damp and 500 bags were lost.

    In the previous incident of grain spoilage, the Qinzhou Prefecture Grain Bureau should bear the main responsibility; because the bureau had found that the grain humidity was too high, but it did not actively seek remedies, but quickly transported it away to evade responsibility. The attitude of the South China Shipping Administration Bureau, "as long as the grain is delivered on time, spoilage has nothing to do with me," is also wrong. In the latter incident, the South China Shipping Administration Bureau cannot shirk responsibility. It is said that there are also situations in which spoilage accidents occur when other ships are loaded with grain. At a time when the rainy season is in full swing and grain is frequently transferred, this issue deserves the attention of grain and transportation departments in various places.

    Grain Mold and Deterioration Phenomenon During Transportation to Disaster Areas in Henan is Very Serious

    Mao Yanwu from the Shangqiu Prefectural Grain Bureau in Henan writes: Last winter and this spring, some areas of Henan suffered severe disasters, and the problem of grain shortage among the masses was serious. Under the care of the Party and the government, a large amount of grain was imported into Henan from Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, Sichuan, Guangdong and other places. However, due to the irresponsibility of certain railway transportation departments, some grain was rained on, rotted, and deteriorated. For example, the Luoyang Railway Station handed over 63 tons of millet transported from Baotou, Suiyuan to the Shangqiu Grain Receiving Station on July 12. Because it had been rained on, most of it had deteriorated, and individual grain bags of millet had sprouted. On June 13, 16 bags of millet transported from Xinxian to Shangqiu Station were rained on and deteriorated, of which 3,200 jin of millet had solidified into lumps and could not be eaten. Similar incidents occur almost every day, which not only causes serious losses to state property, but also affects disaster relief work. It is currently the rainy season, and grain is easily rotted during long-distance transportation. Therefore, it is hoped that the railway transportation department will pay attention to the rain and ventilation work of the carriages, fully prepare rain gear, and educate railway staff to establish an overall concept of cherishing state property, and earnestly do a good job in grain transportation.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    加强粮食运输中的保管工作
    编者按：最近我们收到不少读者来信，揭发某些运输单位对粮食运输工作不负责任，以致造成国家财产的严重损失。这是一个值得注意的问题。为了保证大中城市和工矿区的粮食供应、调剂市场的需要，今后还有大量粮食必须长途运输。因此，做好粮食运输中的保管工作——防雨、防漏、防潮、通风工作，就是一项很重要的任务。负责运输的部门和粮食部门必须共同配合来完成它。现在我们选择一部分读者来信摘要发表于后，希望各有关单位迅速进行检查，并采取有效办法防止粮食在运输途中继续遭受损失。
    粮食部门和运输部门应共同做好粮食运输中的保管工作
    中国粮食公司北京市公司西便门仓库韩宝祥来信：六月上旬，武汉市粮食公司自玉带门车站发至我库的机米，很大数量被雨淋湿。如第五○五九一号棚车共装载三百二十六包粮食，竟有二百零五包受潮。经过我库通风整理，抢救了一部分粮食，但已有六千七百多市斤变色、变味，一百多市斤霉烂不能食用。同月中旬，包头市粮食公司、新乐县粮食局东长寿仓库发来我库的面粉、小麦中，发现因车顶有缝、篷布不结实而遭受损失的情况也很严重。如第三三○二四○号货车，只是用一块旧篷布草率遮盖，结果小麦被雨水淋湿二百七十二包，更严重的是车底积水，淹没了一层粮包，一部分麦粒已膨胀发芽。
    以上所举的不过是一些例子，类似事故目前还在不断发生。建议各路局重视雨季运输的防湿工作，漏雨的棚车须设法修理或加盖油布后再行装运。各发粮单位也应抱着对人民财产负责的态度，在发运粮食前细心检查车皮和篷布是否有漏雨的可能。总之，双方应该共同协力把长途运输中的粮食保管工作做好。
    各地铁路在粮食运输工作中经常发生粮食霉烂变质事故
    中央人民政府粮食部储运管理局马珍来信：目前各地铁路在粮食运输工作中经常发生事故。五月份，从江西温家圳运到西安的一百万斤大米中，竟霉坏了五万多斤，另有八百八十七斤完全变质。南昌运到西安的大米四百万斤中，有十二万六千余斤已经变味，一千三百多斤完全霉坏，装粮麻袋也损坏了五十一条，损失共达二千余万元。从广西南宁拨运到天津的三十一车稻谷，有一百余包长了芽。关内调运到东北的粮食，发霉、长毛的也很多。最近从各地调运到北京的粮食，发热变质的数量尤其惊人；单面粉遭雨淋湿的就有一万一千多袋，估计损失在一亿元以上。我认为各地路局在目前雨季时期，应特别注意粮食在长途运输中的保管工作，纠正上述这种严重损害国家利益的现象。
    衡阳至大浦段铁路沿线上火车经常掉落所运粮食等物
    衡南县桐岗完全小学丁正风来信：六月九日早晨，湖南衡南县第三区材冲乡小学学生罗继达、陈祥美、罗继兰等五人去上学时，在铁路（衡阳至大浦的一段）旁边发现一个装满谷子的大麻袋（估计重量在一百五十斤左右）。一个卖豆腐的人跑来想把谷子挑走，这群小朋友就阻止着说：“这是火车上掉下来的东西，是国家的财物，我们应把它交给政府。”他们于是把这包谷子看守起来，并推一人飞快地跑到材冲乡人民政府去报告，直等到乡人民政府派人来把谷子取走了，这些小学生才到学校里去。
    这些小学生爱护国家财产的行为是值得表扬的。而铁路上对待装运货物的工作却太不负责任了。据我了解，在这段铁路线上，火车经常掉落煤炭、谷子等物。建议各车站的装运人员应以高度负责的精神包装货物，以免人民财产受到损失。
    铁路局承运粮食时事先应该检查车皮和篷布
    吉林铁路管理局梅河口铁路分局运粮委员会吴永春来信：最近辽东省各车站发现从关内运来的大米和面粉霉烂变质的现象很严重。如从武汉玉带门站运到辽东省辽源、临江、大栗子三地的大米，据统计，被雨水淋湿了一千多包，其中变质大米有八万多斤，霉烂不能食用的大米约四千七百斤，再加上麻袋等损失，共计损失人民币四千七百余万元；面粉被雨水淋湿的情况也很严重。类似事故很多，不能一一举出。
    造成这些损失的主要原因，是发运车站对待粮食运输工作不负责任。比如玉带门、汉口、佳木斯等站经常把漏雨的车皮和篷布用来运输大米、面粉。我在辽源车站见到一块遮盖车皮的篷布，上面窟窿很多，最大的窟窿长达三公分，宽一公分；还有许多破口虽已用麻线缝织好，但没有抹上桐油，所以仍易漏雨。又如有一辆自玉带门发到辽源的装载大米的车皮，车门及靠车底边四周都有一公分宽的缝隙，雨水就从缝隙中侵入，接近底层的大米因此被浸湿。另外一个棚车车顶上有漏缝，四周还有几个小窟窿。
    为了避免粮食湿损事故继续发生，各发粮车站应严格注意雨季防护工作。铁路与发货单位在装车前最好检查一次车皮，如双方都认为合格，再行装车。必须使用坚固结实的篷布遮盖粮车；破篷布经过织补后必须抹上桐油，以防漏雨。
    华南海运管理局所属海轮承运粮食发生霉烂事故
    华南海运管理局政治处徐夕明来信：华南海运管理局所属南海一百六十二号海轮某次承运钦州专署粮食局的粮食约二百八十五万公斤到海口去。在装舱时，搬运工人发现这批粮食湿度很高，在运输中容易霉烂，就向海运管理局管理人员提出意见，但管理人员却不采纳。轮船到了海口，发现一千三百多包（每包一百公斤）粮食已完全霉烂变质。
    该局另一艘南海一百七十四号海轮某次承运大米，由于舱底积水没有清除，结果大米受潮，损失了五百包。
    前一次粮食霉烂事件，钦州专署粮食局应该负主要责任；因为该局曾发现粮食湿度过高，但不积极设法补救，而是把它迅速运走而逃避责任。华南海运管理局抱“只要粮食按期运到，霉烂与我无关”的态度也是不对的。后一个事件中，华南海运管理局更是不能推卸责任。据说其它轮船装运粮食时发生霉烂事故的情况也有。在目前正值雨季而粮食调运频繁的情况下，这个问题值得引起各地粮食、交通部门的重视。
    各地运到河南灾区的粮食途中霉烂变质现象很严重
    河南商邱专署粮食局毛艳吾来信：去冬今春，河南部分地区遭受严重的灾害，群众缺粮问题严重。在党和政府的关怀下，大批粮食由东北、内蒙、绥远、四川、广东等地源源输入河南。但是由于某些铁路运输部门的不负责任，致使部分粮食遭受雨淋，霉烂变质。如漯河车站七月十二日交给商邱接粮站六十三吨自绥远包头运来的糜子，由于被雨淋过，大部变质，个别粮包糜子已经生芽。六月十三日，自忻县运至商邱车站的小米，因为受到雨淋而有十六包变质，其中三千二百斤小米已结成块，不能食用。类似事件几乎每天都有发生，这不但造成国家财产的严重损失，而且影响了救灾工作。目前正在雨季，粮食长途运输时很易霉烂。因此，希望铁路运输部门注意车厢防雨、通风工作，充分准备防雨用具，并教育铁路工作人员树立爱护国家财产的整体观念，切实做好粮食运输的工作。
