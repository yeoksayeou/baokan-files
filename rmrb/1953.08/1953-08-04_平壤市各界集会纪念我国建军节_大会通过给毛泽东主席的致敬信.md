Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A rally was held in Pyongyang on July 31st by people from all walks of life to commemorate the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Attending the rally were Kim Il, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Park Ui-wan, Vice Premier of the Cabinet, Hong Ki-ju Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, commanders and fighters of Korean People's Army, heroes of the Republic, labor heroes, and representatives of people from all walks of life in Pyongyang. Also attending the rally were representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers and diplomats from the embassies of various brotherly countries stationed in Korea.

When Marshal Kim Il-sung, leader of the Korean people, General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, and Park Jeong-ae, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, arrived at the venue, they were greeted with prolonged applause from the audience.

General Yu Sung-chul of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army and Yuan Shengping, Chief Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers, spoke successively.

The congress also adopted a letter of respect to Chairman Mao Zedong. The letter reads: Today, as we celebrate the 26th anniversary of the founding of the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army in a victorious environment where we have overcome the arduous war ordeal of resisting the armed aggression of US imperialism and gloriously defended our country’s freedom and independence, we would like to extend our warm congratulations and honor to you, the creator and victorious organizer of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who inherited the glorious revolutionary traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, raised the banner of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to participate in the Korean War, fought closely side by side with the Korean People's Army, displayed unparalleled heroism and courage and a noble spirit of proletarian internationalism, and demonstrated lofty moral qualities.

The immortal and great achievements established by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War will forever radiate light in our national history and be passed on to our children and grandchildren forever.

The letter of respect states: The glorious victory of the peoples of Korea and China in defeating the US armed aggressors is a common victory for the camp of peace and democracy, and a demonstration of the invincible unity and strength of the international democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Although the Korean armistice has been achieved, this is only the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The imperialist warmongers and the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique have not yet abandoned their sinister attempts to oppose the Korean armistice.

Therefore, we, the Korean people, continue to watch whether the US authorities take practical actions to be responsible for ensuring the implementation of the various provisions of the armistice agreement and never slacken our vigilance against the enemy. We, the Korean people, must respond to the call of our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, rapidly restore and develop the people's economy destroyed by the war, further strengthen the democratic base in the northern half, and strive to the end to complete the peaceful reunification and independence of the motherland.

On the occasion of commemorating the glorious 26th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Korean people will further strengthen the friendship and unity with the fraternal Chinese people, and look forward to the Chinese people achieving even more brilliant victories in the struggle to build a prosperous and strong democratic China.

The letter of respect concludes: For the eternal friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China and the lasting peace of Asia, we wish our beloved you a long life.

    平壤市各界集会纪念我国建军节
    大会通过给毛泽东主席的致敬信
    据新华社讯：平壤市各界在七月三十一日举行大会纪念中国人民解放军建军二十六周年。参加大会的有朝鲜劳动党中央委员会书记金一、内阁副首相朴义琓、最高人民会议常任委员会副委员长洪箕畴，朝鲜人民军指挥员、战斗员、共和国英雄、劳动英雄及平壤市各界人民代表。参加大会的，还有中国人民志愿军代表及各兄弟国家驻朝鲜使馆的外交官。
    大会进行时，朝鲜人民领袖金日成元帅、中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军、朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会书记朴正爱的到达会场，引起了全场经久不息的掌声。
    朝鲜人民军最高司令部将领俞成哲和中国人民志愿军首席代表袁升平先后讲了话。
    大会并通过了给毛泽东主席的致敬信。信中写道：今天，我们在克服了三年来反抗美帝国主义武装侵犯的艰苦战争考验，光荣地捍卫我们国家自由、独立的胜利环境中，迎接光荣的中国人民解放军建军二十六周年，我们谨向中国人民解放军的创建者、胜利的组织者——敬爱的您致以热烈的祝贺和荣誉。
    继承了中国人民解放军光辉的革命传统的中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员们，高举抗美援朝的旗帜参加朝鲜战争，和朝鲜人民军紧密地并肩作战，发挥了无比的英雄性和勇敢性与无产阶级国际主义的高尚精神，并显示了崇高的道德品质。
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战争中所建立的不朽的伟大功勋，将永远在我们祖国历史上放射光芒，和永远传留于我们的子孙万代。
    致敬信说：朝中两国人民战胜美国武装侵略者的光辉胜利，是和平民主阵营的共同胜利，是以苏联为首的国际民主阵营的不可战胜的团结和力量的示威。
    现在朝鲜停战虽然实现了，但这还不过是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。帝国主义好战分子和李承晚卖国匪帮，仍没有放弃他们反对朝鲜停战的凶恶企图。
    因此，我们朝鲜人民在继续注视着美国当局是否以实际行动来负责保障停战协定各项条款的实现，并毫不松懈对敌人的警惕性。我们朝鲜人民一定要响应我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的号召，迅速地恢复和发展被战争破坏的人民经济，进一步加强北半部民主基地，为完成祖国的和平统一和独立而奋斗到底。
    在纪念光荣的中国人民解放军建军二十六周年之际，朝鲜人民将进一步加强与兄弟般的中国人民的友谊团结，并期望中国人民在为建设富强的民主中国的斗争中，取得更加辉煌的胜利。
    致敬信最后写道：为了朝、中两国人民永恒的友谊团结和亚洲的持久和平，谨祝敬爱的您万寿无疆。
