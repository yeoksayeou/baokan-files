Huayin County Peasants Actively Prevent and Control Insect Pests, Laying a Good Foundation for Cotton Harvest

A letter from Lei Tingbi and Zhang Xiaowen of the Huayin County People's Government, Shaanxi: The broad masses of peasants in Huayin County actively prevented and controlled insect pests, laying a good foundation for a bumper cotton harvest.

In June of this year, aphids were found to be widespread in the cotton fields of Huayin County. Through the active mobilization of the masses by the People's Government, the aphid infestation was basically eliminated. In early July, cotton bollworms were discovered in Sunzhuang, Jiaozhen, Liangcun and other places in the third district; however, some local farmers had a paralyzing mindset. Some said, "I can't find any worms in the field." Others said, "Cotton bollworms don't come until the seventh or eighth month of the lunar calendar; they won't be here now, and even if they are, it doesn't matter." The local People's Government sent a working group to the area to conduct in-depth inspections of the cotton fields, and found that the insect infestation was already very serious; but because the worms were small and had already burrowed into the flower buds, the farmers had not noticed them. The working group cadres showed the farmers the worms they had found and the damaged cotton and cotton bolls, and provided explanations. The farmers were then convinced. Some said, "If we don't treat it, the cotton will really be eaten up by the worms; the People's Government really cares about our production!" That afternoon, many farmers automatically went to the cooperative to buy pesticides and went to the fields to control the insects.

On July 13, at a meeting of all the working groups in the county, He Xinchun, the secretary of the county party committee, closely combined pest control with drought prevention, flood prevention, and field management, and focused on deploying pest control work. After the working groups went to the countryside on the 14th, they took charge of the work in separate areas. Through practical education and driven by the practical actions of activists, the peasant masses actively controlled the insects. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,500 male and female peasants in the county have participated in insect control, and a total of more than 3,000 mu of insect pests have been controlled, and the cotton field insect pests have been basically eliminated.

Yanbei Special Office Mobilizes the Masses to Control Insects and Dig Pupae, Enabling Peasants to Establish Confidence in Striving for High Yields

A letter from Guo Shi of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture: Armyworms were found to be harmful in the Yanbei Special Area of ​​Shanxi Province. After vigorous manual catching and beating, the insect infestation has stopped spreading. In order to completely eliminate insect pests and strive for a bumper harvest, the Yanbei Special Office assigned special personnel to take charge of the insect-infested areas and actively led the masses to carry out pupa digging work. In the work of digging pupae, all localities generally paid attention to combining it with production. For example, farmers in Tianzhen County combined pupa digging with weeding, killing the pupae under the roots of weeds while weeding. Farmers in Datong County combined pupa digging with the work of composting green manure, killing pupae while pulling weeds for green manure. Therefore, the pupa digging work in various places has been carried out quickly. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties including Guangling, Datong, Shuoxian, and Shanyin, the total number of pupae dug has reached more than 400 jin; among them, the seven villages including Dongyaitou in the third district of Guangling have achieved greater results. Through the pupa digging work, the superstitious idea of ​​some farmers that armyworms are "divine worms" and dare not catch and beat them has been further reversed, and the confidence in eliminating insect disasters and striving for a bumper harvest has been established.

Stop Speculators from Raising Prices and Adulterating Insecticides When Selling Them

A letter from Chen Lisheng of the Agricultural Technology Guidance Office of the Wendeng Special Office, Shandong Province: Recently, many private merchants in many townships and markets in Wendeng Special Area have been selling 666 insecticide powder to farmers. On July 21, at the Yazi market in the tenth district of Rushan County, I saw seven or eight vendors selling 666 powder. They dismantled and repackaged the one-jin packages of 666 powder produced by a factory in Qingdao with an effective ingredient content of 0.65%, and sold each two taels for 600 to 700 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan; this is much more expensive than the medicine prices of cooperatives in various places. Some merchants even mixed talc powder into the medicine powder; and made indiscriminate publicity about the performance and use of 666, such as saying "666 can cure any insects," "it only kills insects and does not poison people," and "use two taels of medicine powder for every jin of water," etc. This will not only reduce the effectiveness of pesticides due to improper use and affect the promotion of pesticides in the future; but it may also cause farmers to be poisoned if they are not careful during use.

At present, the number of farmers using 666 pesticides is increasing day by day, and the above phenomenon may occur in other areas as well. It is recommended that the People's Governments of various localities attach importance to this issue, strengthen the management of pesticide sales, stop private merchants from raising medicine prices and adulterating money; and widely publicize the use technology and storage methods of similar toxic pesticides to prevent the occurrence of poisoning incidents. In addition, cooperative institutions in various places should also attach importance to pesticide supply work, make full preparations, and ensure the needs of farmers.

It is Recommended that the Ministry of Railways Use Fir Wood as Electric Poles and Solve the Problem of Oil Injection for Electric Poles

A letter from Guo Rukun of the Telecommunications Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways: For more than three years, the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has been sending white pine logs that are not suitable for electric poles to the site for use as electric poles, causing huge losses to the country. This kind of white pine is produced in the northeastern forest area. If it is used outdoors in areas with hot weather and heavy rainfall, the part that comes into contact with the soil is extremely susceptible to corrosion; however, it is a good material for building houses, making furniture, and as pit wood. The practice of the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways sending white pine logs to the site as electric poles not only brought great difficulties to telecommunications work, but also caused serious waste of wood. All lines using white pine as electric poles need to be overhauled or renovated in advance before the prescribed repair period; and the lifespan of the electric poles can only reach one-third of the national requirements (the lifespan stipulated by the state is ten to twelve years). For example, the electric poles next to the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai sections of the railway under the Zhengzhou Railway Administration were built in 1950, and more than 2,000 poles fell last winter; this not only affected the driving of trains, but also cost the bureau more than 1 billion yuan in repair materials and labor costs. In addition, white pine is generally thicker. For example, the electric poles for the Tianjin-Pukou Road overhaul project last year were all between 24 and 30 cm in diameter, while the actual requirement was only wood with a diameter of 16 to 18 cm; in this way, the amount of wood wasted is staggering. Many on-site employees have suggested to the Materials Bureau to use fir wood as electric poles to solve the above problems. However, the Materials Bureau was irresponsible and emphasized the difficulties. They replied to the lower-level urging to try to call in fir wood as electric poles, saying: "The use of white pine as electric poles is a national regulation." But we are very strange, why can the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications use fir wood as electric poles? Obviously, the Materials Bureau's reply is just an excuse for not wanting to solve the problem!

In addition, in 1951, the Central Financial and Economic Commission instructed that electric poles and sleepers should be oiled before use in order to save wood; but the Materials Bureau has never implemented this instruction. After repeated negotiations with our bureau, the Materials Bureau finally agreed to supply a batch of oiled electric poles this year. In order to wait for this batch of electric poles, we have been delaying the overhaul project that should have been done this year, and hundreds of workers have been sitting idle waiting for materials; but the Materials Bureau did not care at all after sending the electric poles to the oil injection factory in March and April; In mid-May, we sent someone to the oil injection factory to see, and the result was that the wood had not even been stripped of its bark. In June, the Materials Bureau thought that oil injection was too troublesome, and asked us to use raw materials instead, or only inject oil to a depth of 5 mm (equal to one-sixth of the original planned depth of 30 mm). And now many electric poles are actually only injected with oil of 1 or 2 mm, which is about the same as applying a layer of oil.

In view of the above situation, I think the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways should immediately contact the forestry department and request the allocation of fir wood as electric poles, and use the overly thick white pine in suitable places; and immediately send people to start solving the problem of oil injection for electric poles, in order to save national wood and extend the service life of electric poles.

Introduce Several Methods for Preventing and Controlling Cotton Pests During the Bud and Boll Stage

A letter from the Plant Protection Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government: Experience over the years has proven that cotton suffering from insect pests during the bud and boll stage is one of the important reasons for cotton yield reduction. In 1952, the Jiaozhou Special Area of Shandong Province reduced cotton production by an average of more than 30% due to cotton insect pests during the bud and boll stage. This year, blind bugs, cotton bollworms, etc. have seriously occurred in cotton fields in some areas of Shaanxi, Shanxi and other provinces. In order to improve cotton yield and quality, it is necessary to strengthen pest control. The following is a comprehensive introduction to the effective methods of preventing and controlling cotton pests in various places:

Manual Control Methods

1.  Methods for preventing and controlling blind bugs or weevils: Fill a smooth, deep-bottomed basin with half a basin of water, drip some kerosene on it, place the basin under the cotton plant, and use your hands to continuously beat the cotton branches (you should pay attention to "light beating" and "fast beating"), and the blind bugs and weevils will fall into the basin and drown. The capture and beating should be carried out in the early morning when the dew has not dried. It should be done every seven to ten days in July and August, and the effect is very good; especially during the peak of the insect infestation, the capture and beating effect is even more significant.
2.  To prevent and control cotton bollworms, it is necessary to strengthen field inspections. If insect bites, black granular insect droppings, or open bracts are found on the tender heads and leaves, there are most likely cotton bollworms; you should quickly search and capture them. If the cotton bolls have been bitten with holes, farmers with sufficient labor can use needles to pick out the worms; if the cotton bolls have been mostly eaten, the cotton bolls should be picked off and destroyed.
3.  When cotton is damaged by leaf rollers to the extent of leaf rolling, the masses can be mobilized to kill them by hand pinching. When pinching, you must pinch both ends of the rolled leaves with both hands and then pinch towards the center to kill the larvae and pupae together; if you pinch with one hand, the larvae can easily escape from the other end. In addition, gently slapping with a wooden board is also an effective method for treating leaf rollers.
4.  Pick up fallen flowers and buds. Fallen flowers and buds often harbor pests. They should be picked up in time to eliminate the pests inside, so as to prevent the insects inside from crawling out and continuing to harm the cotton.

Chemical Control Methods

1.  5/1000th 666 powder: In areas with serious blind bugs, spray the medicine every five to seven days, two to three jin per mu each time, and spray three to four times in total. It should be sprayed in the early morning when the dew has not dried. 666 powder can also be used to control the larvae of large leaf rollers, cotton bollworms, and click beetles before they roll the leaves or burrow into the buds and bolls.
2.  DDT preparations: 1/100th DDT powder can control cotton leaf flea beetles. 5/100th DDT powder or 50/100th wettable DDT, 25/100th DDT emulsion at 200 to 500 times solution can control blind bugs, large leaf rollers, click beetles, cotton bollworms, red bollworms and other pests.
3.  Lead arsenate solution: A 1:200 lead arsenate solution can control cotton bollworms, click beetles, large leaf rollers and other pests.
4.  Bordeaux mixture: Bordeaux mixture made of one jin of copper sulfate, two jin of quicklime, and two hundred jin of water can control cotton leaf flea beetles.

The effective time of the above various agents is different, so the interval between spraying agents should also be different. Generally speaking, the efficacy time of 666 preparations is shorter, and the interval between each spraying should generally not exceed seven days, and at most not exceed ten days. After spraying DDT, lead arsenate or Bordeaux mixture, it can be spaced for half a month. Pests in the bud and boll stage often occur in two or more types in the same place and at the same time. It is necessary to distinguish the primary and secondary pests and carry out comprehensive treatment according to the severity of the damage. The dilution, multiples, spraying time and number of times of the agents should be determined according to the main pests.

    读者来信摘要
    华阴县农民积极防治虫害为棉花丰收打下良好基础
    陕西华阴县人民政府雷庭璧、张孝文来信：华阴县广大农民群众积极防治虫害，为棉花丰收打下了良好的基础。
    今年六月间，华阴县棉田普遍发现蚜虫为害。经人民政府积极发动群众及时防治，蚜害基本消灭。七月初，三区孙庄、焦镇、良村等地发现了棉铃虫；但当地部分农民却有着麻痹思想，有的说：“我在地里就检查不出虫来。”有的说：“棉铃虫要到农历七、八月间才有；现在不会有，就是有也不要紧。”当地人民政府就派工作组到该地深入棉田检查，结果发现虫害已经很厉害；但因为虫小，且已钻进花蕊里，所以农民们没有发现。工作组干部就把检查出来的虫子和被咬坏的棉花、棉桃拿给农民看，并作了宣传解释。农民们这才心服了。有的说：“要是再不治，棉花会真让虫吃光了；人民政府真是关心我们的生产！”当天下午，不少农民就自动到合作社买农药下地治虫。
    七月十三日，全县下乡工作组开会时，县委书记贺新春同志密切结合防旱、防涝和田间管理等项工作，着重布置了治虫工作。各工作组在十四日下乡后，就分头包干进行工作。经过实例教育并在积极分子实际行动的带动下，农民群众都积极治虫。据不完全统计，全县已有男女农民二千五百多人参加治虫，共防治虫害三千余亩，棉田虫害已基本消除。
    雁北专署发动群众治虫挖蛹使农民树立争取丰产的信心
    山西省农业厅郭石来信：山西省雁北专区发现粘虫为害，经人工大力捕打，虫害已停止蔓延。雁北专署为了彻底消灭虫害，争取丰收，在虫害地区责成专人包干负责，积极领导群众进行挖蛹工作。各地在挖蛹工作中，一般都注意了和生产相结合。如天镇县农民把挖蛹和锄苗相结合，一面锄去杂草，一面杀死草根下的虫蛹。大同县农民把挖蛹和沤绿肥工作结合起来，在拔杂草沤绿肥时顺便杀蛹。因此，各地挖蛹工作普遍开展得很快。据广灵、大同、朔县、山阴等七县不完全统计，挖蛹总数已达四百多斤；其中广灵三区东崖头等七个村成绩较大。通过挖蛹工作，进一步扭转了部分农民认为粘虫是“神虫”而不敢捕打的迷信思想，并树立了消灭虫灾、争取丰收的信心。
    制止投机商人推销农药时抬价掺假的欺骗行为
    山东省文登专署农业技术指导所陈励生来信：最近文登专区很多乡镇市集上有不少私商向农民销售六六六杀虫药粉。七月二十一日，我在乳山县十区崖子集上，就看到有七、八户卖六六六药粉的商贩。他们将青岛某厂出品一斤装的含有效成分百分之零点六五的六六六粉剂拆散重包，每两售价六、七百元至一千多元不等；这比起各地合作社的药价就要贵得多。而有些商贩甚至还在药粉中掺入滑石粉；并且对六六六的性能和使用方法乱作宣传，如说“六六六什么虫子都能治”，“只杀虫、不药人”以及“使用时每两药粉对一斤水”等。这样不但会使农药因使用不当而减低效力，影响今后农药的推广；而且还可能使农民在使用时不慎而发生中毒事件。
    目前各地使用六六六农药的农民日益增加，其他地区也可能发生上述现象。建议各地人民政府重视这个问题，加强对农药销售的管理工作，制止私商抬高药价和掺假骗钱的行为；并广泛宣传类似有毒农药的使用技术和保管办法，防止中毒事件的发生。此外，各地合作社机构也应该重视农药供应工作，作好充分准备，保证农民的需要。
    建议铁道部改用杉木作电杆并解决电杆注油的问题
    中央铁道部电务局郭儒坤来信：三年多以来，铁道部材料局一直把不适于作电杆用的白松元木充作电杆发给现场使用，给国家造成了巨大损失。这种白松是东北林区出产的，如果在天气过热和多雨地带的露天使用，其接触土壤的部分极易腐蚀；而用于建筑房舍、制家具、作坑木却是好材料。铁道部材料局将白松元木发给现场作电杆的这种做法，不但给电务工作带来了很大的困难，也造成了木材浪费的严重现象。凡采用白松作电杆的线路，不到规定的修整期限，都需要提前大修或中修；而电杆的寿命也只能达到国家要求的三分之一的年限（按国家规定的年限为十年至十二年）。如郑州铁路管理局所属京汉、陇海两段铁路旁的电杆是一九五○年修的，到去年冬季就倒杆二千余根；不但影响了行车，而且该局为此还花了十余亿元的修复工料费。此外，白松木一般都较粗，如去年津浦路大修工程的电杆其直径都在二十四至三十公分之间，而实际需要的却只要是直径十六至十八公分的木材就可以了；这样，浪费木材的数量是惊人的。现场不少职工曾向材料局建议用杉木做电杆，以解决上述问题。但材料局却不负责任，强调困难。他们答复下边促请设法调用杉木作电杆的要求说：“用白松作电杆是国家规定。”但是我们很奇怪，为什么邮电部就能采用杉木作电杆呢？显然，材料局的答复只是一种不愿解决问题的遁辞罢了！
    此外，一九五一年中央财经委员会为了节约木材，曾指示电杆、枕木应注油后再使用；但材料局却一直没有执行这个指示。经我局再三交涉，材料局总算答应在今年供应一部分注油的电杆。为了等这批电杆，我们把今年应该大修的工程一直拖下来，几百个工人窝工待料；但是材料局在三、四月间把电杆送到注油厂后，根本不去过问；五月中我们派人到注油厂去看，结果木材连树皮还没去掉。六月份，材料局又认为注油太麻烦，要我们仍用素材，或者只能注油五公厘深（等于原计划三十公厘深的六分之一）。而现在很多电杆实际上只注油一、二公厘，和涂了一层油差不多。
    针对上述情况，我认为铁道部材料局应该立即与林业部门联系，请求调拨杉木作为电杆，而把过粗的白松，用到适合的地方去；并且立即派人着手解决电杆注油问题，以节约国家木材，延长电杆的使用年限。
    介绍在蕾铃期防治棉花害虫的几项办法
    中央人民政府农业部植物保护司来信：历年的经验证明，棉花在蕾铃期遭受虫害是棉花减产的重要原因之一。一九五二年山东胶州专区曾因蕾铃期棉虫为害而棉花平均减产三成以上。今年陕西、山西等省某些地区棉田中盲椿象、棉铃虫等又已严重发生。为了提高棉花产量与品质，就必须加强防治虫害。兹将各地防治棉花害虫的有效办法综合介绍于后：
    人工防治方法
    一、防治盲椿象或象鼻虫的方法：在一个光滑的深底盆内盛大半盆水，滴上些煤油，将盆子放在棉株底下，用手连打（应注意要“轻打”、“快打”）棉枝，盲椿象和象鼻虫就会掉到盆里淹死。捕打应该在清晨露水未干时进行，七八月间每隔七天到十天打一次，效果很好；特别在虫害盛期，捕打效果更为显著。
    二、要防治棉铃虫必须加强田间检查。如果发现嫩头、嫩叶上有虫口、黑色粒状虫粪或苞叶张开，多半是有棉铃虫为害；就要赶快搜查捕捉。如果棉铃已被咬有窟窿，劳力充裕的农户可用针把虫子挑出；如棉铃已大部被吃空，应把棉铃摘下毁掉。
    三、在棉花遭受卷叶虫为害到达卷叶程度时，可发动群众用手捏杀，捏杀时必须用双手捏着卷叶的两端，再向中央去捏，才能将幼虫和蛹一起捏死；如用一手去捏，幼虫很易从另一端逃掉。此外，用木板轻轻拍杀也是治卷叶虫的有效方法。
    四、捡拾落花落蕾。落花落蕾内常常藏有害虫，应该及时捡拾把害虫消灭，以免里面的虫爬出来继续为害。
    药剂防治方法
    一、千分之五的六六六粉剂：盲椿象严重地区每隔五天到七天喷药一次，每亩每次喷二、三斤，共喷三、四次。要在清晨露水没有干的时候去喷。大卷叶虫、棉铃虫、金钢钻等害虫的幼虫在未卷叶或未钻入蕾铃前，使用六六六粉去除治也有效果。
    二、滴滴涕制剂：百分之一的滴滴涕粉可以防治棉叶跳虫。百分之五的滴滴涕粉或百分之五十的可湿性滴滴涕，百分之二十五的滴滴涕乳剂二百到五百倍液可以防治盲椿象、大卷叶虫、金钢钻、棉铃虫、红铃虫等害虫。
    三、砒酸铅液：一比二百倍的砒酸铅液可防治棉铃虫、金钢钻、大卷叶虫等害虫。
    四、波尔多液：一斤硫酸铜、二斤生石灰、二百斤水配成的波尔多液可以防治棉叶跳虫。
    以上各种药剂的有效时间不同，因而喷药的间隔时间也应该有区别。大致六六六制剂的药效时间较短，每次喷药间隔时间一般不应超过七天，最多不能超过十天。喷滴滴涕、砒酸铅或波尔多液后可隔半个月。蕾铃期害虫常在同一地点、同一时间发生两种以上，必须根据为害轻重，分出主次进行兼治，根据主要的害虫决定药剂的稀度、倍数、喷撒时间和次数。
