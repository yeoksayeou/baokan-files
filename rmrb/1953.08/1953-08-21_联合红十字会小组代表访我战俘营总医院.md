Xinhua News Agency, Bitong, 19th: Representatives of the North Group of the Joint Red Cross Team visited the General Hospital of the POW Administration Office of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and the POW Life and Welfare Exhibition on the 19th.

	This hospital is located on a small hillside facing the Yalu River. The representatives first visited the wards. There were a total of 120 beds, with two beds in each ward; however, the wards were empty because all the sick and wounded POWs had already been repatriated.

	In the hospital's operating room, there were various surgical instruments. Joint Red Cross Team representatives Jacobsen and Kristiansson from Denmark opened the glass cabinet containing surgical instruments, took out a few pieces and examined them approvingly. After visiting the pharmacy, dental department, X-ray department, ophthalmology department, ENT department, and laboratory equipment, Danish representative Megerd said: "The equipment here is very good."

	In this hospital, the dentists and ophthalmologists not only treated POWs who came to the general hospital for treatment, but also regularly went to various POW camps for mobile treatment.

	The head of the hospital told the representatives: "Because our hospital has experienced medical staff, complete equipment, and sufficient medicine supply, it can quickly cure various diseases. Many POWs who have received treatment here have expressed their gratitude in writing or verbally." He also introduced a nurse, Hao. Because of her care and attention to the sick and wounded POWs, the POWs called her "Mama."

	After visiting the general hospital, the representatives also visited the POW Life and Welfare Exhibition. In a large room, various pictures and photos were hung. They showed that UN POWs under the administration of the Korean and Chinese sides received adequate nutrition, sufficient clothing and daily necessities, as well as rich cultural and recreational life and sports activities, and enjoyed freedom of religious activities. The photos also showed that the POWs' lives were very happy, and they even raised many rabbits, birds, puppies and pigeons.

	These photos aroused great interest among the representatives.

    联合红十字会小组代表访我战俘营总医院
    【新华社碧潼十九日电】联合红十字会小组北组的代表们在十九日参观了朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的俘虏管理处总医院和战俘生活福利展览会。
    这所医院设立在一个面临鸭绿江的小山坡上。代表们首先参观了病房。这里共有一百二十张病床，每间病房有病床两张；但是病房里是空空的，因为病伤战俘已经全部遣返。
    在医院的手术室里有着各种手术器械。联合红十字会小组丹麦代表雅各布逊和克里斯坦逊打开放手术器械的玻璃橱，拿出几件来赞许地观察了这些器械。在参观了药房、牙科、X光科、眼科、耳鼻喉科、化验设备等以后，丹麦代表梅格尔德说：“这里的设备很好。”
    这个医院中的牙科和眼科的医生们除了给到总医院来就诊的战俘治疗以外，还定期到各战俘营去作巡回治疗。
    医院的负责人告诉代表们说：“由于本院有着富有经验的医护人员，完善的设备，和充足的药品供应，所以能够迅速治好各种疾病。在这里受到治疗的许多战俘，都用书面或口头的方式来表示他们的感谢。”他还向代表们介绍了一位郝护士。由于她对病伤战俘的关心和照顾，战俘们都称她为妈妈。
    代表们参观了总医院之后，还参观了战俘生活福利展览会。在一间大房子里，挂满了各种图片和照片。它们表明联合国军战俘在朝中方面管理下得到充分的营养，足够的衣服和日用品，以及丰富的文化娱乐生活和体育活动，并且得到宗教活动的自由。照片还表明：战俘们的生活很愉快，他们甚至还喂养了许多小兔、小鸟、小狗和鸽子。
    这些照片引起了代表们的很大兴趣。
