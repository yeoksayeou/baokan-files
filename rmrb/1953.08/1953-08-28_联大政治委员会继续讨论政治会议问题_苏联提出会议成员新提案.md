Xinhua News Agency, August 27th, New York: TASS, New York, August 27th: As previously reported, the head of the Soviet delegation, A.Y. Vyshinsky, spoke at the UN General Assembly Political Committee meeting on the afternoon of August 25th. In his speech, he analyzed and criticized the fifteen-nation proposal, pointing out the errors made by the US-led drafters of this proposal in interpreting Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the composition of the political conference.

Subsequently, Vyshinsky addressed the attempts by certain delegations, particularly the US delegation, to deny the rationality of inviting India and other neutral countries to participate in the upcoming political conference to discuss the Korean issue. Vyshinsky then discussed the issue of membership in the Korean political conference and the criticisms of the Soviet proposal by other delegations. Vyshinsky stated that, based on the Soviet Union's principled attitude towards the political conference issue, and taking into account the opinions of some delegations in the Political Committee regarding the Soviet proposal, the Soviet delegation submitted the following proposal to the Political Committee regarding the membership of the political conference:

"The General Assembly, recognizing the need to ensure the smooth progress of the political conference in the most favorable circumstances, recommends convening a political conference to discuss the Korean issue, to be composed of the following members: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union , the People's Republic of China, India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,SouthKorea, Indonesia, Syria, Egypt, Mexico, and Burma. It must be stated that the resolutions of the conference can only be adopted with the unanimous consent of both sides signing the Armistice Agreement."

Xinhua News Agency, August 27th, New York: TASS, New York, August 26th: At the UN General Assembly Political Committee meeting on the afternoon of the 25th, after the speech by Soviet representative Vyshinsky, Indian representative Menon spoke. He expressed his gratitude to the delegations that supported India's participation in the political conference. He said that the Indian delegation leaves it to the UN General Assembly to decide whether India should participate in the political conference. He pointed out that India itself is not vying to participate in the political conference. However, he emphasized that India has its own vital interests in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. He believes that the statements of those representatives who say that the Korean issue should be resolved by bilateral meetings violate universally recognized facts. Menon said that the Korean issue has been discussed in the United Nations for many years from the past to the present, and the United Nations has the responsibility to resolve this issue. The Indian representative disagreed with the objections raised by the representatives of certain countries to the joint proposal by India, Indonesia, Burma, and Liberia.

The last to speak was US representative Lodge. He once again attempted to justify the United States' attitude on the issue of membership in the political conference. However, he did not say anything new, and he still insisted that the countries participating in the political conference should be limited to those that participated in the Korean War. Lodge said that the US delegation will vote against the proposal to invite India to participate in the political conference. At the same time, he said that, given South Korea's well-known attitude towards India, if the proposal to invite India to participate in the political conference is passed, it would jeopardize the success of the conference.

    联大政治委员会继续讨论政治会议问题
    苏联提出会议成员新提案
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：前已报道，苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基八月二十五日下午在联合国大会政治委员会会议上发言。他在发言中对十五国提案作了分析批判，指出了这个提案的以美国为首的草拟者在解释朝鲜停战协定第六十款关于政治会议组成的规定时的错误。
    接着，维辛斯基谈到了某些代表团，特别是美国代表团企图否认邀请印度以及其他一些中立国家参加即将为讨论朝鲜问题而召开的政治会议的合理性。维辛斯基又谈到朝鲜政治会议的成员问题，谈到其他代表团对苏联提案的批评。维辛斯基说，根据苏联对政治会议问题所采取的原则性的态度，并考虑到一些代表团在政治委员会对苏联提案的意见，苏联代表团向政治委员会提出关于政治会议的成员的提案如下：
    “大会鉴于有必要保证政治会议在最有利的情况下顺利进行其工作，建议召开讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议，由下列成员组成：美国、英国、法国、苏联、中华人民共和国、印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、南朝鲜、印度尼西亚、叙利亚、埃及、墨西哥和缅甸。必须说明，会议的决议只有得到了签订停战协定双方的一致同意，才能作为通过。”
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：在联合国大会政治委员会二十五日下午会议上，在苏联代表维辛斯基发言后，印度代表梅农发言。他对支持印度参加政治会议的代表团表示感谢。他说，印度代表团让联合国大会来决定印度是否应参加政治会议。他指出，印度自己并不争着要参加政治会议。不过，他着重说，印度在和平解决朝鲜问题上有着自己的切身利益。他认为，那些说朝鲜问题应当由双方会议来解决的代表的言论违反了公认的事实。梅农说，朝鲜问题从过去到现在在联合国讨论了好几年，联合国负有解决这个问题的责任。印度代表不同意某些国家的代表对印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和利比里亚联合提案提出的反对意见。
    最后发言的是美国代表洛奇。他再一次企图辩解美国在政治会议成员问题上的态度。但是，他并没有说出什么新的东西，他还是坚持参加政治会议的国家应当限于参加朝鲜战争的国家。洛奇说，美国代表团将投票反对关于邀请印度参加政治会议的提案。同时，他又说，鉴于大家所知道的南朝鲜对印度的态度，如果通过邀请印度参加政治会议的提案，就会危及会议的成功。
