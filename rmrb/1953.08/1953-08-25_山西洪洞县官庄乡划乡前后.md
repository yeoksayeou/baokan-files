Overcoming the "Five Excesses" Phenomenon

The village cadres of Guanzhuang Township, Hongdong County, Shanxi Province, used to be overwhelmed. Excessive "tasks," concurrent posts, and meetings hurt their enthusiasm for work. Two-thirds of the cadres in the township wanted to take advantage of the township consolidation to "change shifts" and take a break. Wang Zhenglun, the secretary of the Beiguanzhuang Party branch, held twelve positions concurrently. People came to him for everything in the village, making him flustered and confused. He once said to the district cadres: "Meetings all day and all night, how can there be time for production? At this rate, it's impossible to live!" Some cadres simply hid when they heard about a meeting. Whenever a task came, everyone pushed it away, afraid of delaying their own production, unwilling to manage it, let alone actively looking for work to do.

On May 5th of this year, the township consolidation work began. After the production township consolidation work team came to this township, they explained that the main purpose of the consolidation was to achieve "simplified administration and diligent people" and to solve the "five excesses" problem in rural areas. At the same time, they conducted future education for the village cadres, making them deeply aware of the future of social development and the glory of serving the people. The village cadres' morale stabilized, and they actively participated in the township consolidation work. Production Director Li Hengchang said: "Since the people support us, we must firmly grasp the political power and serve the people well." Dong Wenkui, the village head of Beiguanzhuang Administrative Village, said: "As long as one person has one job, there is no need to worry about the work."

After the township consolidation, the "five excesses" phenomenon was indeed initially overcome. In addition to being the director of the agricultural production cooperative, Wang Zhenglun only served as the deputy secretary of the Party branch, and all other concurrent positions were removed. He was able to think about the problems of the cooperative very well. In the past, members would look for the director every morning before starting work, wasting time, delaying production, and creating chaos. Recently, Wang Zhenglun had a good discussion with the members, divided the eighteen households in the cooperative into two farming groups, formulated short-term production plans, and implemented a system of fixed work, fixed time, and fixed quantity. The cooperative's production is much better than before.

Learned Leadership Methods

Township cadres rarely studied before. After the township was consolidated and the township government was established, the Party branch secretary, the township head, and the secretary took time to study current events, policies, and agricultural technology with the county and district cadres stationed in the village. Through study, they understood the method of promoting work through typical examples. Most of the land in Guanzhuang Township is paddy field, and two crops are planted every year. After the wheat is harvested, corn is planted. Before the wheat harvest, everyone rushes to use water, but after the wheat harvest, the water is idle. Another problem in this township is the lack of livestock; because each family has only ten or eight mu of land, they cannot afford to raise livestock on their own. In order to solve the problems of animal power and water use, some farmers in Beiguanzhuang had been experimenting with "intercropping" corn as early as 1949 – planting corn in the wheat ridges before the wheat harvest. The intercropped corn grows more than twenty days earlier than the corn planted after the wheat harvest, and the stalks are hard, drought-resistant, and wind-resistant, yielding more than one stone per mu. This method was only used by some people in Beiguanzhuang in the past, and no one in other villages paid attention to it. After the township government was established, the township cadres felt that this was a good way to increase grain production, so they organized more than forty farmers from Nanguanzhuang, Miaocun, Yaoshang, and other villages to visit Beiguanzhuang. The masses saw the benefits of intercropping corn with their own eyes and began to do the same after returning. This year, these three villages intercropped a total of 280 mu of corn.

"Unity Bridge"

There is a large canal in Guanzhuang Township called the "Xiaohe Canal," which runs through the four natural villages in the township and can irrigate more than 1,200 mu of land. It is the lifeline of the people in the township. In the past, the four villages often had disputes over irrigation and could not use water rationally. Nanguanzhuang is in the upper reaches of the canal and is also a large village. They don't irrigate when it rains, when it's windy, or at night. They wait for the most suitable time to irrigate, so farmers in Miaocun cannot irrigate on time. The two villages often fought over irrigation, almost causing deaths. Until before the township consolidation, the farmers in the two villages were still like enemies. During the township consolidation, the farmers in the two villages were unwilling to be consolidated into one township with each other. The masses in Miaocun said: Nanguanzhuang has more people and greater power. We can't afford to offend them if we are consolidated into one township! The masses in Nanguanzhuang said: If we are consolidated into one township with Miaocun, the lawsuits will never end. In order to solve this dispute, the production township consolidation work team asked the masses to discuss the root causes of the dispute in their mutual aid groups while working. During the discussion, the masses in Miaocun recalled a past event: One year, Miaocun and Nanguanzhuang had a fight. "Long Beard" (the rich peasant Chang Jiwu, nicknamed "Long Beard") said: "Fight, I'll take responsibility if anyone dies! After the fight, we'll go to the yamen to fight a lawsuit with them!" From the discussion, the masses in both villages realized: The past disunity was instigated by the feudal ruling class; now that the farmers of the world are one family, we should unite well to engage in production and use water rationally, which is beneficial to the masses in both villages. The masses in both villages were willing to be consolidated into one township. Since then, the disputes that had not been resolved for more than a hundred years were resolved.

After the township government was established, it formulated reasonable water use regulations, avoiding the waste of manpower and water. In the past, it took seven days for Miaocun to complete one round of irrigation, but now it only takes four days. On the Xiaohe Canal, there used to be only a few wooden rafters as a floating bridge, which was inconvenient for transportation and water flow. However, because it was a matter for several villages, no one cared about it. After being consolidated into one township, the masses in the entire township jointly built a stone bridge here. This bridge closely unites the hearts of the people in the township. Therefore, the masses call this bridge the "Unity Bridge."

    山西洪洞县官庄乡划乡前后
    秦洪彦  王秀清  刘仪
    克服了“五多”现象
    山西洪洞官庄乡的村干部，过去常常被压得喘不过气来。过多的“任务”、兼职、会议伤害了他们的工作积极性。全乡三分之二的干部想趁划乡的机会“换班”，歇歇。北官庄党支部书记王正伦，身兼十二职，村里大小事情都找他，闹得他手忙脚乱，昏头昏脑。他曾对区干部说：“成天成夜开会，那有时间搞生产？这样下去，日子真没法过！”有些干部听说要开会，就干脆躲起来。每逢一件工作来了，你推，他推，谁也怕耽误自己的生产，不愿意管，更不要说主动地找工作做了。
    今年五月五日，划乡工作开始了。生产划乡工作组来到这个乡以后，说明划乡的主要目的，是为了“政简民勤”，解决农村中的“五多”问题；同时向村干部进行了前途教育，使他们深刻认识到社会发展的前途和为人民服务的光荣。村干部情绪稳定了，积极参加了划乡工作。生产主任李恒昌说：“人民既然拥护咱，咱就得紧紧掌握好政权，好好为人民办事。”北官庄行政村村长董文奎说：“只要能一人一职，工作便不发愁了。”
    划乡以后，“五多”现象的确是初步克服了。王正伦除担任农业生产合作社社长外，只担任党支部副书记，别的兼职都去掉了。他能够很好地考虑社里的问题了。过去社员每天早上做活都找社长，浪费了时间，耽误了生产，而且秩序很混乱。最近，王正伦和社员们在一起很好地商议，把全社十八户分成两个耕作小组，制订了短时期的生产计划，并推行了定工、定时、定量的制度。社里的生产比过去好多了。
    学会了领导方法
    乡干部以前很少学习。划了乡，成立了乡政府以后，党支部书记、乡长、秘书抽空就和驻村的县、区干部一块学习时事、政策、农业技术。经过学习，他们懂得了通过典型推动工作的方法。官庄乡的土地大部是水地，每年种两季庄稼，割了麦子种玉茭。麦收前大家都抢着用水，麦收后水却闲着。这个乡的另一个问题是牲口少；因为每家都是十亩八亩地，独自喂牲口喂不起。为了解决畜力和用水的问题，北官庄有些农民早在一九四九年便试验“间种”玉茭——在麦收前把玉茭点种在麦垄里。间种的玉茭比麦收后种的早二十多天，秆硬，耐旱，抗风，每亩能多打一石多。这种办法过去只是北官庄有人采用，别的村子没有人注意。乡政府成立以后，乡干部感到这是多打粮食的好办法，便组织了南官庄、苗村、窑上等村的四十多个农民到北官庄参观。群众亲眼看到间种玉茭的好处，回去后就开始照着做。今年，这三个村共间种了玉茭二百八十亩。
    “团结桥”
    官庄乡有一条较大的水渠，名叫“潇河渠”，横贯全乡的四个自然村，可浇地一千二百多亩，是全乡群众的命脉。过去，四个村常因浇地闹纠纷，不能合理用水。南官庄在渠的上游，又是个大村子，他们下雨不浇、刮风不浇、黑夜不浇，要等最合适的时候浇，苗村农民都不能按时浇水。两村常常因为浇地打架，几乎闹下人命。直到划乡前，两村的农民还是和仇人一样。在划乡中，两村的农民谁也不愿和谁划为一乡。苗村群众说：南官庄人多势力大，划成一乡咱可惹不起！南官庄群众说：要是和苗村划为一乡，官司就打不完了。生产划乡工作组为了解决这个纠纷，便让群众在做活时，以互助组为单位讨论纠纷的根源。苗村群众在讨论中回忆起过去的一件事：有一年，苗村和南官庄打起架来了，“长胡子”（富农常吉吾，外号“长胡子”）说：“打，打死有我负责！打了再和他们到衙门打官司！”从讨论中，两村群众都认识了：过去的不团结是封建统治阶级挑拨的；现在天下农民是一家，应该好好团结搞生产，合理用水，对两村群众都有利。两村的群众就都愿意划为一乡了。从此，百余年来解决不了的纠纷得到了解决。
    乡政府成立后，订出了合理的用水规约，避免了浪费人力和水的现象。过去苗村轮浇一次得七天，现在四天就行了。潇河渠上，过去只有几根木椽搭成的浮桥，交通不便利，水也不畅通。可是，因为是几个村的事情，所以谁也不管，划为一乡后，全乡的群众共同在这里修了一座石桥。这座桥把全乡人民的心紧紧团结在一起。因此，群众把这座桥叫成“团结桥”。
