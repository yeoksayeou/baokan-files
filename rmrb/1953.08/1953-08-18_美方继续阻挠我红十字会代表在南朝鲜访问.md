Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th: Since the Korean-Chinese members of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee protested to the other side on August 14 regarding the obstruction of the work of the Korean-Chinese representatives of the Joint Red Cross teams in South Korea, the U.S. military authorities have not improved their attitude towards the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives.

According to reports, the U.S. military administration of the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp has arbitrarily withheld the letters of sympathy and support brought by the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives for the prisoners of war, stating that they have no intention of handing these letters over to the prisoners of war at all, claiming that these letters "will be returned to Panmunjom by the military authorities." The Korean-Chinese Red Cross brought 798 boxes of canned meat and 410 boxes of cigarettes to comfort our captured personnel, but the U.S. military administration of the prisoner-of-war camp has so far failed to distribute them.

Mr. Yuan Gen, the chief representative of the Korean-Chinese side of the Joint Red Cross South Group, has not only been unreasonably obstructed by the U.S. military authorities in his work on Koje Island, but also, due to the lack of communication facilities provided by the U.S. side, he is unable to understand the work situation of the Korean-Chinese representatives of the various subgroups affiliated to the Joint Red Cross South Group.

The Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives of the Busan subgroup were forced to stop working on August 8.

    美方继续阻挠我红十字会代表在南朝鲜访问
    【新华社开城十七日电】自从战俘遣返委员会朝中委员在八月十四日的会议上就联合红十字会小组朝中代表在南朝鲜工作受到阻挠事向对方提出抗议以来，美方军事当局仍未改善其对待朝中红十字会代表的态度。
    据记者获悉：巨济岛战俘营美军管理当局蛮横地扣留了朝中红十字会代表带给战俘们的慰问信，并表示根本不准备将这些慰问信交给战俘，声称这些慰问信“将由军事当局送回板门店”。朝中红十字会带去慰问我方被俘人员的七百九十八箱肉类罐头和四百一十箱香烟，战俘营美军管理当局迄今根本未予分发。
    联合红十字会小组南组的朝中方面首席代表元根先生不仅自己在巨济岛工作受到美军当局的无理阻挠，而且由于美方不予通讯方面的便利，使他不能了解联合红十字会南组所属各分组的朝中代表的工作情形。
    釜山分组的朝中红十字会代表在八月八日即被迫停止工作。
