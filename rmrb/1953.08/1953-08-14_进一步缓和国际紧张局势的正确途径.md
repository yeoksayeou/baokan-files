    What are the characteristics of the current development of the international situation? What are the new avenues for further easing international tensions that people all over the world are striving for? These are major issues of universal concern to people of all countries.
    Comrade Malenkov's recent speech at the closing session of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union provides a key to understanding the current international situation and points out the correct path for further striving to ease international tensions. Comrade Malenkov's speech has aroused widespread reaction in world public opinion and has been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people of all countries.
    As Comrade Malenkov pointed out, "The characteristic of the current international environment is first of all that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the entire peace and democracy camp have achieved significant successes in their efforts to ease international tensions and strive for peace and to stop new wars." The main manifestations of this achievement are the realization of the armistice in Korea and the extinguishing of provocative adventurous actions in Berlin. These are major victories for the cause of peace, and also shameful defeats for the US imperialists who launched the Korean War and created the Berlin adventure.
    However, the creators of war and adventurous actions do not stop because of their failures. Contrary to the ideas of most of humanity, they continue to strengthen the "Cold War" and provocative policies. Therefore, Comrade Malenkov pointed out: "The current stage of development of international relations is a particularly important and critical stage. If the current easing of the international atmosphere is allowed to give way to an increase in tensions, it would be a crime against humanity." The decisions made at the recent Washington meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France show that the American ruling clique is forcing Britain and France to abandon their own vital interests and abandon their previously proposed summit meeting of the four powers, replacing it with a four-power foreign ministers' meeting nominally to solve the German problem but actually unwilling to solve it. The Washington Conference communique openly emphasized that the three countries will continue to work to implement the plan to establish a "European Army", making Germany a militarist country again, reviving a breeding ground for war like Hitler's Germany; at the same time, under the pressure of the United States, Britain and France agreed that "pending further consultations, the three countries should maintain a common policy towards Communist China", that is, continue to implement the "embargo" and "blockade" against China, and obstruct our country from obtaining its legitimate rights in the United Nations. Not only that, Britain and France also agreed that if the American puppet Syngman Rhee group deems it appropriate to launch another adventure, they will support it; and use the so-called "the results of the Korean armistice must never jeopardize the restoration and guarantee of peace in other parts of Asia" as a smokescreen to try to cover up "Dulles' plan to support Paris in accelerating the war in Indochina" ("New York Times"). Subsequently, Dulles forced fifteen countries, including Britain and France, who followed the United States in invading Korea, to issue a so-called joint declaration, attempting to force the fifteen countries to take joint action when the United States and Syngman Rhee resume and expand the Korean War.
    A few days ago, Dulles, the representative of the extreme reactionary group in the United States who had been issuing orders at the Washington Conference, went to South Korea again, revealing the same ugly face he had when he personally instigated and planned the Korean War three years ago, openly colluding with and condoning Syngman Rhee, attempting to sabotage the armistice, and concluding a so-called "common security treaty" with Syngman Rhee to allow the US aggressor troops to stay in South Korea indefinitely and continue to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Dulles' various conspiracies, such as the Washington Conference, the conspiracy with Syngman Rhee, and his trip to Japan, and his conspiracy to manipulate the United Nations General Assembly after returning home, are clearly to continue to implement the policy of opposing the easing of international tensions, that is, the United States' notorious "tough policy." It is especially important to point out that since the United States had to accept the armistice in Korea, and the Korean armistice is bound to greatly encourage and promote the struggle of the people of all countries to further negotiate solutions to all other international disputes, making it increasingly difficult for the Dulles' of the United States to continue to pursue a global "tough policy," these enemies of peace have become particularly panicked and are trying their best to deliberately weaken the great significance of the Korean armistice to the cause of peace, preventing the overall easing of the situation in the Far East and the world resulting from the Korean armistice.
    Just as the Western proverb says: God often makes criminals insane when they are dying. Although international adventurers have repeatedly run into walls, they are still unwilling to give up their aggressive plans. Following the bankruptcy of the atomic bomb blackmail policy, the American warmongering group continues to spread war hysteria. However, the reason why they are unlucky is that they refuse to face and admit the lessons of their failures, and now the so-called hydrogen bomb monopoly myth that they use to threaten the Soviet Union has burst like a soap bubble. These blackmailers, like people about to drown in water, desperately clutching at every straw that slips from their hands, cannot hide their inner despair and are particularly agitated. But everyone knows that the Soviet Union will not and does not need to use atomic bombs or hydrogen bombs to threaten anyone. The Soviet Union decided to manufacture them only because the United States refused to destroy them. Therefore, on the contrary, this will only enhance the strength of safeguarding peace.
    All the conspiracies of the American adventurers are bound to go bankrupt. The peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is inviolable. More and more kind people in all countries are seeing this fact clearly. People are no longer willing to continue to tolerate the provocations of the American aggressive group.
    The urgent task facing peace-loving people all over the world is to give a powerful counterattack to the policy of the American Dulles' aggressive group to maintain international tensions. The will of hundreds of millions of people demanding peace has become a strong and effective force, which has forced the aggressors to stop their aggression in Korea. In the future, the continued strengthening of this force will inevitably be able to guarantee peace and international security.
    Comrade Malenkov reiterated the Soviet Union's consistent peaceful foreign policy, saying: "We firmly advocate that there are no unresolved issues or disputes that cannot be resolved peacefully on the basis of mutual agreement between the countries concerned." "The entire current situation shows that the major powers have a special responsibility for further easing international tensions and resolving disputes through negotiations." The Soviet Foreign Ministry's reply to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on August 4 was based on this peaceful foreign policy. Although the reply pointed out that the three countries' decision to convene a meeting of foreign ministers of the four powers violated international practice and existing agreements on meetings of foreign ministers, and was not really intended to solve the German problem, the Soviet Union, in view of the great significance of holding a meeting of the major powers for resolving international disputes, still agreed to hold a meeting of foreign ministers of the four powers, but suggested that the meeting of foreign ministers of the four powers should discuss, in addition to the German problem, including the restoration of German unity and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, ways to ease international tensions, and pointed out: "Important and urgent issues in the situation in Asian countries also attract international attention. Therefore, it is also necessary for the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion on easing international tensions. The great Chinese people, who are more closely united than ever in the People's Republic of China, have every reason to demand the restoration of their legitimate rights in all international affairs. Ignoring the importance of solving this problem immediately is detrimental to strengthening peace and international security." This concrete action taken by the Soviet government is obviously conducive to easing international tensions. Any government that truly cares about the fate of its people should take measures to practically promote the resolution of international outstanding issues.
    Comrade Malenkov also pointed out: "Enhancing the prestige and role of the United Nations organization is an important prerequisite for consolidating the cause of peace." "The United Nations organization should return to the path stipulated by the United Nations Charter." He also emphasized: "If the rights of all countries are truly respected, the policy of ignoring China should be terminated, and the infringed rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored. Within the United Nations organization and the entire international relations system, the great China must retain its own legitimate status." World public opinion generally believes that it is reasonable and justified for the People's Republic of China to obtain its legitimate status in the United Nations, and only in this way can the United Nations be consolidated and truly and effectively fulfill its responsibility of safeguarding peace.
    The United Nations General Assembly will be held in a few days to discuss the Korean issue. This will be another test for the United Nations. All countries that have obligations to the United Nations Charter should make the United Nations once again an organization for defending peace and security.
    These goals put forward by the Soviet government for further easing international tensions are undoubtedly the path that peace-loving people all over the world should strive to follow.
    The Chinese people have proved themselves to be a strong force in defending world peace, and will continue to work to maintain world peace, especially to consolidate peace in the Far East. The current urgent task is to vigorously support the Korean people in quickly healing the wounds of war. The Soviet government has decided to immediately allocate one billion rubles for the restoration of Korea's devastated economy. The support of the Chinese and Soviet people will be a great encouragement to the heroic Korean people. At the same time, the Chinese people will resolutely fight to the end to fulfill the armistice agreement and further peacefully resolve the entire Korean issue. The despicable conspiracy currently being carried out by Dulles and Syngman Rhee against the political conference must be smashed. In addition, the Chinese people believe that restoring and strengthening normal relations with the Far East and other countries is of great significance to the cause of peace. Any act of hostility towards the Chinese people and obstruction of the establishment of normal relations with China is a violation of the interests of the people of all countries and is what the Chinese people will resolutely oppose.
    While continuing to fight for peace, the Chinese people will always strive to strengthen unity and cooperation with the Soviet Union and all people's democratic countries, so that the peace and democracy camp will continue to be consolidated and strengthened. The continuous consolidation and strengthening of the democratic camp is an inevitable law of development and the most reliable guarantee for the cause of world peace. Comrade Malenkov pointed out: "It is impossible to force the eight hundred million people of the big family composed of the people of the countries of the democratic camp to give up the historical fruits they have exchanged for blood and sweat, to give up their own people's regime, and to restore the regime of the exploiters. Whoever does not understand this will put himself in a very stupid position. The whole world knows that the aggressive forces cannot turn the wheels of history backward. Those who want to pursue a clear-headed policy in international affairs should base themselves on reality and on facts, whether they like it or not." This should be a timely sobering agent for the current international ambitious.

### 进一步缓和国际紧张局势的正确途径

    进一步缓和国际紧张局势的正确途径
    什么是目前国际局势发展的特点呢？全世界人民所要争取的进一步缓和国际紧张局势的新的途径是什么呢？这是各国人民所普遍关切的重大问题。
    马林科夫同志最近在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议闭幕会议上发表的演说，提供了理解当前国际形势的钥匙，并指出了进一步争取缓和国际紧张局势的正确途径。马林科夫同志的演说引起了世界公众舆论的广泛反应，受到各国爱好和平的人民的热烈欢迎。
    正如马林科夫同志所指出的，“目前国际环境的特点首先在于，苏联、中华人民共和国和整个和平民主阵营在为了缓和国际局势、为了争取和平和制止新战争而作的努力中，获得了重大的成就。”这个成就的主要表现是在朝鲜实现了停战和在柏林扑灭了挑衅冒险行动。这些是和平事业的重大胜利，也就是发动朝鲜战争和制造柏林冒险行动的美帝国主义者的可耻的失败。
    但是战争和冒险行动的制造者并不因为自己的失败而罢手。和大多数人类的想法相反，他们还在继续加强“冷战”和挑衅政策。因此，马林科夫同志指出：“国际关系发展的现阶段，是一个特别重要和紧要的阶段。如果使目前已经出现的国际气氛的一些缓和重新让位给紧张局势的增强，那就是对人类的一种罪行。”最近美、英、法三国外交部长举行的华盛顿会议的决定，就表明了美国统治集团正在强迫英法两国违背自己的切身利益，放弃它们曾经提出的举行四国首脑会议的主张，代之以名为解决德国问题而实际上并不想解决这个问题的四国外长会议。华盛顿会议公报公开强调三国将继续努力实行建立“欧洲军”的计划，使德国重新成为军国主义国家，复活希特勒德国那样的战争温床；同时，在美国的压力下，英法同意“在未进一步协商之前，应维持三国对共产党中国的共同政策”，即继续实施对中国的“禁运”“封锁”，并阻挠我国取得在联合国的合法权利。不仅这样，英法还同意如果美国的傀儡李承晚集团认为宜于发动另一次冒险时，他们将予以支持；并以所谓“朝鲜停战的结果绝不得危及亚洲其他地方和平的恢复与保障”为烟幕，企图用以掩盖“杜勒斯支持巴黎加速进行印度支那战争的计划”（“纽约时报”）。随后，杜勒斯又迫使英法等十五个随同美国侵略朝鲜的国家发表一个所谓共同宣言，企图强制十五个国家在美国和李承晚恢复和扩大朝鲜战争的时候将采取共同行动。
    几天之前，曾经在华盛顿会议上发号施令的美国极端反动集团的代表杜勒斯，又到了南朝鲜，显露出他在三年前亲自煽动和策划朝鲜战争时那样的丑恶面孔，公开地勾结和纵容李承晚，企图破坏停战，并与李承晚缔结所谓“共同安全条约”，使美国侵略军无限期地留驻南朝鲜，继续阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。杜勒斯在华盛顿会议上，在和李承晚的预谋上，在他到日本去之类的种种阴谋活动上，以及他回国后关于操纵联合国大会的阴谋上，显然都是为了继续执行反对缓和国际紧张局势的运动的政策，亦即美国的臭名远扬的“强硬政策”。尤其要指出的是，由于美国不得不在朝鲜接受停战，而朝鲜停战势必大大鼓舞和推动各国人民争取进一步协商解决其他一切国际争端的斗争，使美国杜勒斯之流继续推行全球的“强硬政策”越来越感困难，于是，这些和平的敌人就特别慌乱起来，竭力要故意减弱朝鲜停战对和平事业的重大意义，阻止由朝鲜停战导致远东和世界局势的全面缓和。
    恰恰像西方的谚语所说的：上帝对于犯罪者，在他垂死的时候，每每使他疯狂。国际冒险家们虽然一再碰壁，却依然不愿放弃他们的侵略计划。继原子弹讹诈政策的破产之后，美国好战集团继续散播战争歇斯底里症。可是，他们所以倒霉的地方，就在于他们不肯正视和承认他们失败的教训，现在它们所借以对苏联实行威胁的所谓氢弹的垄断神话，又像肥皂泡那样宣告破灭了。这些讹诈者们像快要淹死在水里的人连一根稻草也从手里滑掉了一样，掩不住内心的绝望，特别激动地喧嚷起来。但谁都知道苏联是不会也不需要拿原子弹或氢弹来威胁谁的，苏联所以决定制造它们仅仅是因为美国拒绝销毁它们。因此，相反地这只会增强了保障和平的力量。
    美国冒险家们的一切阴谋都必然要破产，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营是不可侵犯的。各国善良的人们越来越多地看清了这个事实。人们再也不愿继续容忍美国侵略集团的挑衅了。
    摆在全世界爱好和平人民面前的紧迫任务，就是要对美国杜勒斯之流的侵略集团维持国际紧张局势的政策予以有力的回击。千百万人要求和平的意志已经变成了强大和有效的力量，曾使侵略者不得不在朝鲜停止侵略，今后这个力量的继续加强，也必然能够保障和平与国际安全。
    马林科夫同志重申苏联一贯的和平外交政策说：“我们坚决主张，现在没有任何未决问题或争端不能在有关各国互相协议的基础上和平解决。”“整个当前的形势表明，对于通过谈判进一步缓和国际紧张局势和解决争执问题，大国负有特别的责任。”八月四日苏联外交部给美英法三国政府的复文就是从这一和平外交政策出发的。复文虽然指出三国决定召开四国外长会议是违反国际惯例和现存关于外长会议的协定，并且不是真正要解决德国问题的，可是苏联鉴于举行大国会议对于解决国际争端具有重大意义，仍同意举行四国外长会议，但建议四国外长会议除了讨论德国问题、包括恢复德国统一及缔结对德和约问题以外，还应讨论缓和国际紧张局势的办法，并指出：“亚洲国家局势中的重要迫切问题也吸引着国际间的重视。因此，中华人民共和国参加关于缓和国际紧张局势问题的讨论也是必要的。比以往任何时候都更加紧密地团结在中华人民共和国里的伟大的中国人民，有充分的理由要求恢复他们在一切国际事务中的合法权利。如果忽视立即解决这个问题的重要性，是不利于加强和平与国际安全的。”苏联政府所采取的这一具体行动，显然是有利于缓和国际紧张局势的。任何一国真正关心自己人民的命运的政府，都应当采取措施，在实际上促成国际悬案的解决。
    马林科夫同志还指出：“提高联合国组织的威信和作用，是巩固和平事业的重要先决条件。”“联合国组织应当回到联合国宪章所规定的道路上来。”他又着重强调：“假使当真尊重一切国家的权利的话，就应当终止忽视中国的政策，并恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中遭受侵犯的权利。在联合国组织内和整个国际关系体系内，都必须让伟大的中国保有它自己的合法地位。”世界公众舆论都普遍认为中华人民共和国取得在联合国的合法地位，是合情合理的，而且只有这样，联合国才能得到巩固，才能真正有效地履行保障和平的职责。
    日内联合国大会就要举行，讨论朝鲜问题。这将是对联合国的又一次考验。所有对联合国宪章负有义务的国家，都应使联合国重新成为保卫和平与安全的组织。
    苏联政府为进一步缓和国际紧张局势而提出的这些目标，无疑地是全世界爱好和平人民所要努力遵循的途径。
    中国人民已经证明自己是保卫世界和平的一支强大力量，今后将继续为维护世界和平，特别是巩固远东和平而努力。当前的迫切任务，是大力支援朝鲜人民迅速医治战争创伤。苏联政府已决定立即拨出十亿卢布作为恢复朝鲜的遭受破坏的经济之用，中苏人民的支援将是对英雄的朝鲜人民的莫大鼓舞。同时，中国人民将坚决为履行停战协定和进一步和平解决整个朝鲜问题而奋斗到底。目前杜勒斯和李承晚对政治会议所进行的卑鄙预谋，必须加以击破。此外，中国人民认为恢复和加强与远东及其他各国间的正常关系，对和平事业有着重大的意义。任何敌视中国人民和阻挠与中国建立正常关系的行为，都是违反各国人民的利益的，都是中国人民所要坚决反对的。
    在继续为和平而斗争的时候，中国人民将时刻努力加强与苏联及所有人民民主国家的团结与合作，使和平民主阵营不断臻于巩固和强大。民主阵营的不断巩固和强大是必然的发展规律，也是世界和平事业的最可靠的保障。马林科夫同志指出：“要想迫使民主阵营各国人民所组成的大家庭的八亿人民，放弃他们用血汗换来的历史性的果实，放弃他们自己的人民政权，并恢复剥削者的政权，是不可能的。谁要是不懂得这一点，谁就会使自己处于十分愚蠢的地位。全世界都知道，侵略势力不能够把历史车轮扭向后转的。要想在国际问题上奉行清醒的政策的人们，应该以现实为基础，以事实为基础，不管他们喜欢不喜欢。”这对于目前的国际野心家们应该是一服适时的清醒剂。
