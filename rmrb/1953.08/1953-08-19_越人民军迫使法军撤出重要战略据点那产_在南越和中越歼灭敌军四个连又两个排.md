(Xinhua News Agency, August 18th) According to the Vietnam News Agency on August 16th: Under the powerful pressure of the Vietnamese People's Army, the French troops withdrew from Na San, an important strategic location with dense fortifications in the Northwest region of Vietnam, on August 9th and 10th. The retreating French and puppet troops consisted of four battalions. People's Army troops have entered the Na San area on the 11th.

A spokesman for the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army pointed out: The Na San base was established by the French army after suffering a disastrous defeat in Northwest Vietnam in December 1952. The French army once stationed fifteen infantry battalions and many artillery battalions there. They built an airport and constructed thirty-eight bunker fortifications in an area two kilometers wide and three kilometers long.

The spokesman pointed out: The reason why the French army had to abandon the Na San base, which they had worked hard to build for nine months, was that the French army originally occupied Na San in an attempt to re-occupy the vast Northwest region of Vietnam. However, due to the resistance of the people, although the French army had occupied Son La, the provincial capital northwest of Na San, three times, they had to withdraw from Son La three times. The enemy realized that even if they occupied Na San, they could not re-occupy Northwest Vietnam. Secondly, Na San was completely isolated, far from other French bases, difficult to supply, and difficult to defend, and it was bound to be annihilated by the People's Army. Therefore, they had to withdraw from Na San to avoid this danger and reorganize their forces.

The spokesman then pointed out: The retreat from Na San is a failure of the French army's plan to re-occupy Northwest Vietnam, and also a serious setback for the French army's cluster of fortifications tactics. The People's Army forced the French army to withdraw from Na San, shattering the enemy's strategic plan. Due to the liberation of Na San, the People's Army recovered most of the Northwest region and created conditions for establishing and consolidating this vast base of resistance stretching from the banks of the Red River to the northern border of Laos.

The spokesman also emphasized that the retreat from Na San means that the French army will concentrate their forces in the North Vietnamese plains, and their mobile forces will increase. Therefore, we should increase armed forces in the enemy's rear areas and liberated areas, heighten vigilance, and not let go of any opportunity to annihilate the enemy. By doing these things, we can ensure that Navarre (Commander-in-Chief of the French invading army in Vietnam) cannot alleviate the French army's predicament in the North Vietnamese plains after withdrawing troops from Na San, and they will suffer new defeats.

(Xinhua News Agency, August 18th) According to the Vietnam News Agency on August 17th: In the past few weeks, the Vietnamese People's Army has launched offensives against the French army and conducted many counter-sweeping operations in various parts of South and Central Vietnam, achieving victories in annihilating four companies and two platoons of French troops.

In July, the People's Army annihilated two companies of French troops in a counter-sweeping operation in My Tho province near Saigon. Most of the French commanders were either killed or captured. The weapons seized by the People's Army were enough to equip an entire company.

After the victory in My Tho, the People's Army then attacked four French strongholds in the Cai Be area, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy troops stationed along the Nguyen Van Tiep canals. The French troops, in great confusion under the victorious offensive of the People's Army, hurriedly withdrew from six strongholds. At this time, a company of puppet troops from two strongholds surrendered to the People's Army with all their weapons and ammunition.

On July 25th, in the Quang Binh-Quang Tri-Thua Thien area of Central Vietnam, the People's Army killed and wounded nearly one company of French troops sweeping through Hai Lang district. Three days later, the People's Army ambushed a unit of French troops in Phuoc Son, annihilating two platoons of French troops.

    越人民军迫使法军撤出重要战略据点那产
    在南越和中越歼灭敌军四个连又两个排
    【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社十六日讯：在越南人民军的强大压力下，法军在八月九日和十日撤出了越南西北地区的重要战略地点、工事密集的强大据点那产。撤退的法军及傀儡军有四个营。人民军部队已在十一日进驻那产地区。
    越南人民军总部发言人指出：那产基地是法军在一九五二年十二月在越南西北部遭到惨败后建立的。法军在那里一度驻有十五个步兵营和许多炮兵营。他们修建机场，在一个两公里宽、三公里长的地区内修筑了三十八个碉堡工事。
    发言人指出：法军不得不放弃经过九个月努力修筑的那产基地的原因是：法军原来侵占那产，是想重新侵占广大的越南西北地区，但是由于人民的反抗，法军虽曾三度侵占那产西北的山萝省会，但又不得不三度自山萝撤退。敌人认识到即使占住那产，也不能重新侵占越南西北部。其次是那产完全孤立，远离法军其他基地，供应困难，难以据守，难免要被人民军歼灭，因此，他们不得不退出那产，以避免这种危险并重整他们的有生力量。
    发言人接着指出：那产的撤退是法军企图重占越南西北地区的计划的失败，也是法军的碉堡群战术的严重挫折。人民军迫使法军撤出那产，粉碎了敌人的战略计划。由于那产的解放，人民军收复了大部分的西北地区，并为建立和巩固这个从红河河岸到寮国北部边界的广大抗战基地创造了条件。
    发言人同时强调说，那产的撤退意味着法军将把他们的力量集中在北越平原，他们的机动部队将有所增加。所以我们应该在敌后地区和解放区增加武装部队，提高警惕，不放松歼灭敌人的机会。做到这几点，我们就能使纳瓦尔（法国侵越军总司令）在把军队撤出那产后不能解救法军在北越平原的困境，使他们遭受到新的失败。
    【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社十七日讯：在过去的几个星期中，越南人民军在南越和中越各地进攻法军和进行了多次反扫荡战，取得了歼灭法军四个连又两个排的胜利。
    七月里，人民军在西贡附近美萩省的反扫荡战中歼灭法军两个连。大部分的法军指挥官不是被打死就是做了俘虏。人民军缴获的武器足够装备一个整连。
    在美萩作战胜利后，人民军接着进攻丐?地区的四个法军据点，并使沿阮文接等运河驻扎的敌军遭到重大损失。在人民军胜利进攻下非常混乱的法军连忙从六个据点撤走。在这时候，有两个据点的伪军一个连携带全部武器和弹药向人民军投诚。
    七月二十五日，在中越广平—广治—承天地区，人民军杀伤了在海兰县扫荡的法军近一个连。三天以后，人民军又在福山伏击法军的一支部队，歼法军两个排。
