Learning and Inheriting the Excellent Traditions of Folk Music
—Understanding Some Issues in Folk Music Singing and Folk Instrumental Music
Lǚ Jì

Editor's Note: The First National Folk Music and Dance Performance, held in April this year, showcased many excellent folk music and dance programs, vividly illustrating the richness of China's folk art treasure and exerting a significant influence on China's music scene. Based on the analysis and research of the programs presented at that performance, and in connection with certain issues debated in China's music circles, the author of this article expresses opinions worthy of attention. Resolving these issues is of great significance for the development of China's musical art, and we hope that comrades in the music field will continue to study and discuss them.

(I)
The National Folk Music and Dance Performance, like the National Opera Performance, demonstrated the long history and rich, excellent traditions of China's folk music culture. Seeing those excellent programs made our understanding of the lives and spiritual outlook of China's working people clearer and more profound. Those melodies, whether majestic, delicate, sonorous, or soaring, all kinds of healthy and beautiful singing, and the simple, accurate, and full expression of the performance and superb techniques of various instruments, vividly reflected the optimistic mood of the Chinese working people, and their love for the new life, for labor, and for their great leader, thereby arousing strong resonance among the broad masses of listeners and giving them powerful encouragement.

Faced with the infinitely rich and excellent folk music art, we are increasingly aware of the poverty of our own created musical art, and recognize the real reasons for our creative weakness. It should be said that we not only lack life experience, but especially lack a deep analysis and correct understanding of life; we not only lack the necessary technical training in composition, singing, and playing, but especially lack a correct understanding of technology; therefore, we also lack the ability to express life. More seriously, we lack comprehensive knowledge and in-depth research on the national music tradition, and can almost be said to be ignorant. Some people even blindly refuse to accept the excellent traditions of national music. Therefore, the musical art we create cannot but be linguistically weak, rhythmically monotonous, technically deficient, lacking in appeal, unable to express emotions, and even express emotions that are unsound and divorced from the masses. After listening to excellent folk music programs, on the one hand, we are more clearly aware of the shortcomings of our own work, and at the same time greatly increase our work confidence. Everyone realizes that as long as we earnestly experience life, earnestly train our skills, and earnestly learn folk music, and insist on developing new music on the basis of the excellent traditions of national music, new musical art will definitely grow, become richer, and will definitely be welcomed by the masses.

(II)
Folk music always infects us with its strong popular emotions, making us feel something real and moving in life. Although it is mainly through the lyrics (the lyrics of folk music always vividly depict the lives of the people and meticulously express their thoughts and emotions), the lyrics rely on infectious musical images to move us more deeply and powerfully. For example, listening to Han Qixiang's storytelling and singing, it is because of his simple musical image and his enthusiastic and varied singing that he prominently portrayed the characters of Liu Qiao and others, coupled with his excellent sanxian accompaniment, that we temporarily forgot everything else and were brought into the musical world he created, following Liu Qiao to fight against feudal forces together. Listening to the revolutionary mountain songs of Xingguo, Jiangxi, that sincere music and excited singing with a nostalgic mood unfolded a vivid picture for us, as if we saw the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people in the old revolutionary base areas during the Second Revolutionary Civil War was extremely vigorous. Listening to the singing of Bao Yinde Lige of Inner Mongolia, we naturally followed her unrestrained, full, and long singing into the grassland life of the people of Inner Mongolia, and as her singing with profound affection unfolded, we increasingly felt her love for life. In these performances, popular emotions permeated every note, and almost all other folk music programs were like this. Therefore, everyone felt that going deep into life to experience the thoughts and emotions of the working people is the most urgent task at present, which is naturally very correct.

In these excellent folk music programs, form and content are often combined so perfectly, and rich life is so vividly expressed in various musical forms, that we feel that in folk music art, form and content seem to have no contradictions, and it seems that all folk artists have never felt the limitations of form and technology. Of course, this is not the case. However, folk music art often creates forms based on content, and often develops technology based on content. When the contradiction between form and content arises, and the original technology cannot express the content of life, it always makes the form subordinate to the content and creates new technology to meet the requirements of the content. Therefore, the content is always vividly expressed in a form and technology suitable for it. For example, the "Chuanjiang Boatmen's Labor Song" is obviously due to that special labor and the thrilling life on the water, requiring them to use a special form, combined with their labor form, to express their strong will and optimistic spirit formed by long-term struggle with the rapids, they abandoned the general folk song form and created a form like "Boatmen's Labor Song." "Qingpu Field Song" also illustrates this problem. Local farmers felt that the general folk song form was not suitable for their labor form (they also used to work collectively), and could not meet their labor emotions, so they created the musical form of "Field Song" (the one introduced in this performance is divided into eight sections: Touge, Qianme, Qianliao, Changsheng, Ganlaoya, Houme, Houliao, Juesheng, etc., but there are also those divided into seven sections, and the tunes also have various different treatments). The same is true in instrumental performance. When folk artists felt that the general tunes could not express the joyful mood of "A Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix," they developed their playing skills and created the sound of simulating various bird calls, inserting them into the music to strengthen its joyful mood. When Suona artist Zhao Chunting felt that the general Suona timbre was not enough to express emotional changes, he changed the method of holding the reed and blowing air, creating a timbre similar to Xiao, Dizi, and Sanxian; obviously, these creations greatly developed the Suona's playing skills, enriched the Suona's expressive power, and achieved the purpose of further expressing life.

(III)
Although folk songs, as Gorky pointed out, always intimately accompany history and have their own opinions, truthfully reflecting the thoughts and emotions of the people. But we cannot forget, as Marx pointed out, "The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas." Therefore, in the past under feudal rule, the working people often accepted certain ideas of the feudal ruling class. There are such lines in the mountain songs of southern Shaanxi:
	
	It drizzles from the sky,
	Poor people on the ground wear ragged clothes,
	Fingers are of different lengths,
	Tree branches are of three heights.

This is obviously the fatalistic thought of the landlord class, educating the poor working people to be content with poverty. In feudal society, farmers accepted this thought as their own. There are also such lines in "Walking to the West Exit":

	The river flows long,
	Let others walk ahead,
	Afraid of the depth of the water,
	Follow others behind.

This is the selfish and self-interested thought cultivated by the landlord class, which is completely opposite to the "sharing weal and woe" thought widely circulated among the working people. We must critically and prudently remove the backward and anti-people dross and absorb its excellent and democratic essence. Here, we cannot but point out an erroneous idea. Some people believe that since folk music art grows among the people and is loved by the people, it is all good and does not need to be criticized or should not be criticized. This is a one-sided view. Affirming the excellent traditions of folk music is completely necessary, but blindly and generally affirming the backward and anti-people things (which were infiltrated by the feudal landlord class or produced under the influence of the feudal landlord class's ideology) without careful research and specific analysis will hinder our correct acceptance of the national heritage.

Similarly, some people do not make specific analyses of certain folk music and put a non-people's hat on them, completely denying them. It is said that a kind of instrumental ensemble in Fujian was labeled as the music of the literati class by some cadres in East China because it was related to Southern Opera, and was not selected to participate in the performance. Some places also believe that ancient music preserved in some temples, although originally folk music and itself has great historical significance, such as the music of temples in Xi'an, which has great value for studying the development of folk music, is considered feudal superstitious music and is not valued and excluded from the scope of research. This rude attitude is very wrong and will bring us many great losses.

Among some music cadres, there is another wrong idea that since it is affirmed that folk music has excellent traditions, it must be perfect and flawless. Therefore, as soon as they come into contact with certain shortcomings of folk music, they begin to doubt it fundamentally, and even deny folk music in turn. After the performance of "Mountain Songs" in southern Shaanxi, "Qingpu Field Songs," and "Chuanjiang Boatmen's Labor Songs" in this performance, some people thought that the tunes were high, male voices used falsetto a lot, and some individuals sang unnaturally in some places, so criticisms such as "harsh," "so high that it simply exceeds the limits of what the human voice can bear," "lacking a complete image," and "not only did not touch people's heartstrings, but disrupted people's heartstrings" arose. In fact, when we say that folk music has excellent traditions, we mean the entirety of folk music. We cannot therefore think that any kind of folk music or any folk artist can represent the entirety of excellent traditions; moreover, even if a certain folk music or a certain folk artist represents a certain aspect of the excellent traditions of national music to some extent, it will never be perfect and flawless. It is wrong to insist on treating folk music and folk artists' performances with unrealistic requirements. It will only lead us to ignore folk music and close the door to learning from folk music.

(IV)
The characteristic of folk music artists is that they are good at expressing life emotions clearly and vividly with their clear language. This makes our vocalists feel that what they need to learn from folk artists is mainly how to grasp thoughts and feelings and how to master language. It is undeniable that many people who have received Western vocal training have ways to solve problems in controlling breathing, expanding range and volume, and embellishing voices, and there is no need to learn from folk artists in particular. However, many vocal workers regard how to grasp thoughts and feelings and how to master language as too simple, thinking that as long as they go to the lives of the masses, they can quickly solve it, and they regard this work as just a technical work, and do not see its ideological content. Therefore, they do not start from understanding the world (worldview) and understanding life (outlook on life), and transform their thoughts, feelings, preferences, interests, and aesthetic viewpoints. As a result, although they live among the masses, they have never truly understood the thoughts and feelings of the people, so the thoughts and feelings expressed in the singing are still not those of the masses. The failure of Comrade Tao Jianxin's singing stems from his lack of a correct understanding of the Shaanxi people's feelings of missing Chairman Mao, and he replaced the masses' optimism with his own unhealthy emotions.

(It should also be pointed out here that Comrade Tao Jianxin was successful in learning the Shaanxi dialect and applying it to singing, but this part of the success cannot compensate for his failure in another aspect.) Similarly, many people regard mastering language as just a matter of pronunciation, which is a lack of deep understanding of the true content of language in vocal art. The language in vocal art not only requires clear pronunciation (which is necessary), but more importantly, it must vividly express the emotions of the language. Therefore, it is inevitable that we must understand the entire meaning of the lyrics and their spirit. This not only requires us to have literary cultivation, but especially requires us to have infinitely rich knowledge of the language in the lives of the masses, and truly know the changes and differences in the tone and momentum of the same language in the mouths of different characters and under different emotions, and also need to know how to exaggerate it artistically. Like famous actors Zhou Xinfang, Gao Yuanjun, Han Qixiang, and many other excellent folk artists, they undoubtedly expressed their deep understanding of language, rich knowledge, and outstanding expressive ability in their singing art. They truly mastered the language. Only that kind of language truly has the greatest appeal. Only through their vivid language is it possible to emit the brilliance of life. This requires long-term arduous research and training, especially the ability to gain insight into life. Many folk artists do have different creativity in this regard, which is worthy of our earnest discovery and painstaking study.

(V)
Some of the vocal issues raised for research in this performance are related to issues that have been hotly debated in the past. I would also like to raise them here for discussion with everyone.

The "Western" versus "Local" issue that has been debated endlessly in vocal music for many years actually includes two central disputes: the issue of whether the basic vocalization method is scientific or unscientific and the issue of the tendency of expression methods.

Although the basic vocalization methods of modern Western singing (because I don't understand their medieval singing methods, I have to narrow the scope) and traditional Chinese singing since the Tang and Song dynasties (which has concrete materials to verify) are the same, some comrades who have received some Western vocal training must say that all Chinese singing methods are unscientific, and all folk artists' vocalizations are unscientific; on the other hand, some comrades say that all Chinese singing methods, all folk artists' singing methods, as long as they are welcomed by the masses and can express thoughts and emotions, are all scientific. On the contrary, if it cannot meet the requirements of the masses and cannot express the people's thoughts and emotions, even if he has received the correct training in Western vocalization methods, his method cannot be considered scientific, because it cannot solve practical problems, and science is to solve practical problems. In fact, this is no longer a debate about whether the vocalization method itself is scientific or unscientific, but a debate about two different concepts and two different standards. The former believes that only those who have received Western vocalization method training are scientific, and the latter believes that only those who are welcomed by the masses and can solve practical problems are scientific. Neither side has studied the vocalization method itself. In fact, both Western and Chinese vocalists and vocal art have vocalization methods that are scientific and unscientific. Let's not talk about Western vocalization methods for now. Looking at the vocalization methods of actors in various local operas in China, many black heads and painted faces in local operas use explosive sounds to sing in order to express the characters' personalities, creating special effects. Although they are also welcomed by the masses, their vocalization, just speaking of vocalization, is really unscientific. In Sichuan High Opera, some of the chorus parts are sung too high in some places. It sounds like the singer is very strenuous and the voice is very forced, but it is also welcomed by the masses, which is really unscientific. Some shadow puppetry actors in Northeast China, perhaps in order to adapt to this particularly decorative art form, pinch their necks and sing a very sharp voice, which should also be said to be unscientific, at least it violates the natural vocalization law. Some members of some cultural and art troupes have neither received Western vocalization method training nor absorbed the excellent vocalization methods of Chinese folk artists. At some times, they are indeed shouting with their necks straight, which is also really unscientific. In the past, many local opera troupes did not allow young male and female actors who were undergoing voice changes to get adequate rest, and like ordinary people, they had to undertake many singing tasks, which was indeed an unscientific system. Some troupe leaders or masters, in order to make more profits, forced actors whose voices had become hoarse due to illness or fatigue to continue singing, and said that the voice trained in this way is an iron voice, and no matter how you sing, it will not fail. This practice and this statement are unscientific (if appropriate rest is given when the voice is already hoarse, and not too much singing is done, the voice will be more rounded). The singing method of Xiaosheng in Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera may not be completely unscientific, but there is no need for development, so it will not be discussed here. It is subjective and unscientific not to admit these unscientific parts. However, apart from this, countless excellent folk artists have used extremely natural, healthy, and beautiful voices to create a variety of singing styles. Some people have more skillfully used well-trained clear falsetto, combined with round and loud real voices, with a wide range and ease of use. Such as famous actors Chang Xiangyu, Ding Guoxian, Xu Qianyun, Huang Hong, the Miao ethnic group's A Pao, Inner Mongolia's Bao Yinde Lige, Kazakhstan's Bu Butai, the Yi ethnic group's Bai Xiuzhen, the Hui ethnic group's Zhu Zhonglu, as well as the majority of singers of Shaanxi Southern Mountain Songs, Qingpu Field Songs, and Chuanjiang Boatmen's Labor Songs, what is there to criticize? Why can't we use scientific viewpoints to analyze, study, and develop our own vocal singing art? Why can we only be limited to the scope of modern Western vocal singing art? Why can we only admit that Western vocalization methods are scientific, and the vocalization methods of our national excellent folk artists must be unscientific? We must also admit the great achievements and brilliant traditions of these folk vocalists in vocal music. Only in this way is it fair. The statement that everything that is welcomed is scientific is a lack of specific analysis and is also unscientific. There are often very complex reasons for being welcomed, including the expression of content, form, and emotions. The vocalization of popular singers is scientific, and there are also unscientific ones. We must never regard these two words as synonyms, and we must conduct detailed and specific research. Moreover, the masses' understanding of some issues is also limited. We want to affirm the vocal creation and achievements of folk artists, and we should not refuse to learn from modern Western vocal science. If conditions are met, and we should vigorously advocate it, so that everyone can master the science of vocalization, in order to study the rich heritage of national vocal art and develop national vocal art. Science is the summary of practice, practice is multi-faceted, is forward-looking development, science should be based on extensive practice, and it should also be forward-looking development. The standard of whether the vocalization method is scientific or unscientific mainly depends on whether this singing method has played and developed the singer's voice in all aspects, whether it can help him obtain the voice needed to express various contents, whether it can be used freely, and whether his voice is obviously becoming more and more perfect in a very natural situation? There can be no other standards. In vocal music, we must vigorously oppose the viewpoints of blind dogmatism and narrow empiricism.

The issue of the tendency of expression methods is a more complex issue. In fact, there are two tendencies in our expression methods: realism and non-realism. Looking at the tendency of expression methods in the tradition of national vocal art through last year's opera performance and this year's folk music and dance performance, it can be definitely said that it is realistic. However, the expression methods of some of our vocalists are non-realistic.

In the past two or three years, we have not conducted serious research and discussion on the main issues of expression methods—the basic principles of handling emotions, handling language, and handling sounds, the relationship with life, and national characteristics—and have only been entangled in individual and minor issues, such as the falsetto issue. It is undeniable that many new vocalists have made many efforts in overcoming some serious shortcomings in the past two or three years, such as overcoming not paying attention to thoughts and feelings, not paying attention to language, and not paying attention to the habits of the masses in sound embellishment, and there have been significant improvements in these areas. However, the actual scientific research is far behind the objective needs, so that some hardworking and sincere vocalists and promising young vocal apprentices do not get strong help and clear guidance when studying these issues.

Many singers regard the issue of expression methods as a purely technical issue of controlling the voice, so they think that there is no need to experience the lives of the masses; they also think that expressing the thoughts and feelings of the work mainly depends on the voice, and they can ignore the language. As a result, the higher the technical cultivation, the worse the singing effect. It is natural that such singers cannot succeed in singing Chinese songs (whether folk songs or original songs). It should be sincerely stated that it is not that these singers are inherently unable to sing Chinese songs, nor is it that all Chinese songs are so bad that they cannot evoke the emotions of the audience. The real reason is that the singers do not handle the singing from a realistic point of view, and cannot correctly use their technology to conduct independent creation, so they can only reluctantly sing some works taught by the teacher or some works learned from records. We must overcome this weak situation. We must learn from the singing methods of folk artists. Folk artists are born from the working people, and coupled with long-term life practice, they have a deep understanding of social life and are extremely familiar with the thoughts and emotions of various characters. When singing, they also pay great attention to expressing the thoughts and emotions they have experienced through vivid language in a detailed manner. Therefore, their singing is full of real life emotions and has a strong appeal. Han Qixiang's "Liu Qiao's Reunion" and Shi Xuejie's "Anti-Tiangong" in this performance can be said to be the best examples of handling singing from a realistic point of view. Through this performance, everyone realized that experiencing the lives of the masses, deeply analyzing the works, and correctly handling technical issues are important methods to correct their mistakes.

The language issue has already been discussed earlier, so it will not be discussed here again.

Regarding the handling of sound issue, only express some opinions on the issues that are still being debated at present, because this issue is one of the central issues of the "Western" and "Local" controversy in vocal music, and it has been extended from new music workers to local opera actors, and the impact is very large. The problem arises because many people who have received Western music education are accustomed to hearing men sing in real voice and women sing in falsetto, while Chinese folk music is just the opposite. Men mostly sing in falsetto, and women in general cultural and art troupes mostly sing in real voice. Some people (mostly those who have received Western music education) advocate that women should use more, even all, falsetto to sing, and men should sing in real voice; another part of people (mostly those who have not received Western music education) basically agree that men should generally use real voice to sing, but think that women should also mainly use real voice, because this kind of singing is welcomed by the masses.

According to the facts, Western vocal music emphasizes that women use more falsetto, not all falsetto. On the one hand, it is to expand the range of female voices. Generally, the use of falsetto high notes can expand four to eight or nine notes; on the other hand, it is also to make the male and female voices in the chorus have a clear contrast. It should be admitted that this is the development and progress of vocal culture. In Chinese Peking Opera, Qingyi mostly use falsetto (equivalent to Western soprano), Xusheng mostly use real voice (equivalent to Western tenor), and black heads all use real voice (equivalent to Western baritone). In handling the sound, Peking Opera tends to separate voice parts in order to distinguish the age and personality of different roles, which is a great progress compared to many other local operas. We should accept this scientific principle. Saying that women using more falsetto to sing is not welcomed by the masses, the main reason is not the real voice or falsetto. As far as I know, most of the reasons are that the singing itself lacks emotion and the emotion is not full; of course, there are also cases where the falsetto lacks training, the volume is too small, and some are because the tone change area is placed too low, and the lower part of the falsetto cannot be sung. However, we cannot conclude from this situation that women should not use falsetto, which can only lead to the conclusion that it needs to be strengthened, or the tone change area should be appropriately raised. If we do not develop the female falsetto, it will hinder the development of the female voice, which is detrimental to the art of vocal music. If based on this opinion, female actors who play Dan roles in Peking Opera are changed to sing with real voice, it will surely destroy many beautiful singings in Peking Opera. Naturally, emphasizing all falsetto also narrows the range of female voices, which is not conducive to the development of vocal art. Some people say that it is not easy to pronounce clearly when singing with falsetto, which is unfounded, because there is no necessary connection between real voice and pronunciation, and many female actors in Peking Opera pronounce very clearly. The correct principle should be: in order to make the male and female timbres have a clear contrast and expand the range of female voices, this requires female voices to fully use falsetto and appropriately use real voice, and make the two seamlessly combined. The singing of famous actor Chang Xiangyu can be said to be the best example to illustrate this principle. Of course, we must not force the old people in southern Shaanxi, Qingpu and other places to change their traditional singing methods that men use more falsetto in order to practice this correct principle. In particular, I hope that the leading comrades of local operas in various places and the responsible cadres for opera reform work should not create a public opinion or atmosphere to force female actors to change to sing with real voice (some places call it the original voice, and some places call it Pinghou), and even more should not mobilize female actors to change to sing with real voice like some local opera troupes in Central and South China, and ask them to publicly review the idea of not wanting to change to sing with real voice. In fact, it is not wrong for them not to want to change to sing with real voice, the mistake lies with the cadres, and it is the cadres who should review.

There is another question that should be raised for discussion with everyone. What way do new vocalists adopt to accept the national vocal heritage? Some people emphasize that every vocalist must actually learn a kind of local opera or storytelling. I think that we can only explain that actually learning a kind of local opera or storytelling will be more effective in accepting the national vocal heritage, but we cannot say that if we have not actually learned a local opera or storytelling, we will definitely not be able to inherit or accept the excellent traditions of the national vocal heritage. Just as modern poets do not necessarily have to learn to write five-character or seven-character poems, Lisao or Book of Songs-style poems, in order to inherit the heritage of Chinese classical literature. Of course, for those vocalists who have come back from abroad who do not understand Chinese vocal art at all, and have not even heard of it, in addition to listening, actually learning their singing will definitely get more and deeper experience, but we cannot take whether they can sing well a kind of local opera or a kind of storytelling as a basis for measuring whether they have the sincerity to accept the national vocal heritage, because singing well a kind of local opera or a kind of storytelling is not a simple task. Even if some people have great determination to learn, it is difficult to learn well, and in accepting the national vocal heritage, the most important thing should be the singing method, the view of handling emotions, handling language, and handling sounds. However, if someone thinks that anyway, I cannot be required to sing well a kind of local opera or a kind of storytelling, so I do not seriously learn the singing art of local operas and storytelling, then of course it is a wrong idea.

(VI)
In terms of instrumental music, although there are not many programs from various places participating in this performance, it fully shows that national instrumental music art has the excellent tradition of realism and outstanding technology. Feng Zicun's flute playing, She Laxi's horse head fiddle in Inner Mongolia, Zhao Chunting's Suona in North China, Chaozhou gongs and drums, and the ensemble "A Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" in East China are among the programs that received the most enthusiastic response from the audience. Now, let's talk about several principled issues raised by everyone in the performance and several issues related to the direction of instrumental music development.

The first is the issue of the evaluation of simulated music. Some comrades believe that instrumental music, like vocal music, should express real emotions through rich tunes and give the audience emotional infection with vivid musical images. In addition to this, simulating human voices singing opera, simulating insects, birds and other animal calls are not the tasks of instrumental music; it is believed that this kind of simulation can only reduce the meaning of instrumental music. If it is necessary, it can be listed as acrobatic art, but it should not be advocated within the scope of music. However, some comrades also believe that any simulated music reflects a life emotion and is also a way of reflecting life, so the masses need and welcome it; and simulating any sound requires breaking through general playing methods and creating a special playing technique, which enriches and develops the playing techniques of instruments, and has the same value as instrumental music that expresses life with tunes. It cannot be said that which one should be the main one, which one should be developed, and which one should not be developed. I think the former's first part of the opinion is completely correct. Regarding simulated music, there should be a distinction. For example, Suona Kaxi, Big Lei and Sanxian Kaxi, and Cow Horn Kaxi can vividly express the specific emotions and even the momentum of the singing of a certain role or several roles singing a certain opera excerpt. This is not only music, but also can satisfy the dramatic requirements of some audiences, and evoke the emotions expressed by a certain opera excerpt in the audience's memory. This is completely acceptable and should be listed as a unique instrumental music form, although it is not the main part of instrumental music (because what it can express is far less real and perfect than the human voice). As for simulating the calls of other animals, I think it is difficult to say whether simulating the calls of various animals has musicality without leaving the specific situation and not looking at the simulation itself and its relationship with the whole song. Of course, the special technology created by simulation is meaningful, but we cannot affirm the musical value of simulated sounds from this point. And the masses' welcome is not necessarily from the perspective of appreciating music, but also may be from the perspective of appreciating acrobatics. The important thing is what purpose the performer uses to simulate. If it is like "A Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" to simulate bird calls in order to increase the joyful mood of the song, or for other needs, describing a specific time, season, place, and can arouse the audience's emotional response, and it is indeed artistically processed and becomes an indispensable part of the music, and clearly expresses a certain emotion (this is completely possible. The reason why "A Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" in East China is more musical than "A Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" in Central and South China is precisely in these places), then it is handled from a realistic point of view and has musical value, and there is no reason to oppose it. Did Beethoven not very artistically simulate the call of the cuckoo in his Sixth Symphony and achieve an extraordinarily beautiful effect? If it is not like this, but like the simulated music "Clock Shop" in Western music, simulating the sound of clocks with a naturalistic technique, there is no musical value. However, we do not need to oppose folk artists occasionally simulating it, especially we should not interfere or prohibit it. Even if the masses welcome it from the perspective of appreciating acrobatics, it is completely acceptable (only the performance of blowing the Suona with the nostrils should be discouraged). As long as professional performers realize that it will not be developed as a form on a large scale, it will never have a destructive impact on instrumental music.

Some people say that some folk artists have changed their thinking after entering the city, and want to wrap white copper skin on wind instruments and are unwilling to use Chinese instruments to accompany them, implying that they are deeply dissatisfied with such folk artists. Are such folk artists moving forward, or are the people who express dissatisfaction too conservative? I think that as long as these folk artists do not despise folk music in their hearts after entering the city, and do not have the idea of being unwilling to play folk instruments, and only absorb some progressive factors of Western music, such as using piano accompaniment, or even improving instruments to enrich and develop folk music, this is beyond reproach. They may not be able to handle it well because of their low level of education and lack of modern music scientific knowledge, which is inevitable. We have no right to express dissatisfaction, let alone ridicule them; on the contrary, we should vigorously help them improve their cultural level and learn music scientific knowledge so that they have sufficient ability to correctly develop folk music. As for wrapping a layer of white copper skin on the instrument, as long as it does not damage the original beautiful timbre of the instrument, there is no need to restrict or oppose it.

Obviously, we cannot let folk music continue to be in a relatively simple stage, nor can we let it continue to be in a state of isolation and isolation from world music culture, especially we should not refuse to absorb progressive factors; it must be combined with world music culture, and folk music must move forward, as long as it does not deviate from the foundation of the people, does not deviate from its excellent traditions, and does not destroy its national style. Otherwise, it will inevitably become a conservative, a narrow nationalist in music, which we need to be vigilant and should vigorously oppose.

(VII)
It is undeniable that folk music is the product of the social practice of the working people over thousands of years, reflects their optimistic emotions in participating in social practice, and is the crystallization of their highest wisdom. Today, social life has undergone earth-shaking changes. Many folk music have not lost their brilliance because of this. Some tunes that have long been forgotten have been given new life by the people after liberation and have been revived (such as the excavation of many old tunes that have not been used for many years in the opera reform work in East China, Northeast China, Beijing, Tianjin and other places). The old society did not need these music, and buried these music, while in the new society, they have reappeared their brilliance. But we cannot say that the old tunes that still exist today and have been unearthed can well express today's new life. We can only say that some of the life emotions reflected in these music still exist today, or even if that life has passed and that life emotion has become a relic, it still has educational significance for modern people. Some new life that the people have never experienced in the past, such as the people's conscious anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle life, today's people's love and praise for the motherland, for the great people's leader, and for heroes, the collective life of the people's soldiers, and the working people's yearning for a socialist happy life, etc., cannot be competently expressed by the original folk music. Therefore, Nie Er had to create mass songs such as "March of the Volunteers", and Xinghai had to create works such as "Yellow River Cantata". After liberation, the oral composers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang (because they cannot write music) Suritan Murat had to create "Salute to Beijing", and Abukelimu had to create countless new songs such as "Long live! Mao Zedong" to replace the old songs to sing about the new life. "March of the People's Liberation Army" is ultimately not something that folk songs can replace, because in the past, the people lacked the new thoughts and emotions brewed by the combat life led by such a glorious, correct, and great party and leader. Saying this does not in the slightest mean that our generation, whether new music workers or oral composers, are more talented than all the musicians in history, nor does it in the slightest diminish the great popular nature of past folk music, but only to illustrate the limitations of the social practice that produced past folk music.

The limitations of folk music do not stop there. In terms of the form of expression, we cannot but admit its simplicity, and sometimes it does reach the point of simplicity, which is formed under the restriction of certain social conditions. Also due to the limitations of social conditions, it is not possible to achieve a high degree of synthesis and concentration. Many times it is plain and straightforward, with too much repetition, lack of change and development, and lack of strict organization. These shortcomings are just waiting for new music workers who have mastered modern music scientific knowledge to make up for, develop, and enrich them, so that it can reach a higher level and become more perfect. Does saying this lower the meaning and value of folk music? I think her profound popular nature, the musical image full of popular emotions and highly contagious, and the concise and highly generalized musical language will not be concealed by these limitations in the slightest. It is precisely because she has such excellent factors that she strongly moves us, towers above many of our creations, and is worthy of our efforts to learn, inherit, and carry forward. Chairman Mao taught us earnestly that we must first be students of the masses, and then we can be teachers of the masses.

    学习和继承民间音乐的优秀传统
    ——对于民间音乐演唱与民间器乐中的一些问题的理解
    吕骥
    编者按：在今年四月举行的第一届全国民间音乐、舞蹈会演中，集中地表演了许多优秀的民间音乐、舞蹈节目，具体说明了我国民间艺术宝藏的丰富，给予我国音乐界以很大的影响。本文作者根据对那次会演所提供的节目的分析研究，并联系我国音乐界争论的某些问题，发表了值得重视的意见。这些问题的解决，对我国音乐艺术的发展，有很大的意义，希望音乐界同志们继续研究和讨论。
    （一）
    全国民间音乐、舞蹈会演和全国戏曲会演同样显示了我国民间音乐文化的悠久历史和丰富的优良传统。看了那些优秀的节目，使我们对于我国劳动人民的生活和精神面貌认识得更清晰、更深刻了。那些或者是雄浑的、或者是清丽的、或者是嘹亮的、或者是高亢的曲调，各式各样的健康而优美的歌声，以及朴素地、准确地、充分地发挥了各种乐器的性能、技术卓越的演奏，鲜明地反映了我国劳动人民的乐观情绪，和他们对于新的生活、对于劳动、对于自己的伟大领袖的热爱，因而引起了广大听众强烈的共鸣，给他们以有力的鼓舞。
    面对着无限丰富的、优秀的民间音乐艺术，我们益发感到我们自己创作的音乐艺术的贫弱，并认识到我们的创作贫弱的真实原因。应该说，我们不仅缺乏生活，尤其缺乏对于生活的深刻分析和正确理解；不仅在创作、演唱、演奏上缺乏必要的技术锻炼，尤其缺乏对于技术的正确理解；因此，也就缺乏表现生活的能力。更严重的是，我们对于民族音乐传统缺乏全面的知识和深入的研究，几乎可以说是无知。某些人甚至盲目地拒绝接受民族音乐的优秀传统，因此，我们创作的音乐艺术不能不是语言贫弱、节奏单调、缺乏技术、缺乏感染力，不能表现情绪，甚至所表现的情绪是不健全的，脱离群众的。听了优秀的民间音乐节目以后，一方面固然使我们对于我们自己工作的缺点认识得更清楚，同时也大大增加了工作信心。大家都认识到，只要认真地去体验生活，认真地锻炼自己的技术，认真地学习民间音乐，坚持在民族音乐的优秀传统的基础上发展新的音乐，新的音乐艺术就一定会成长起来，丰富起来，就一定会得到群众的欢迎。
    （二）
    民间音乐总是以其强烈的人民情绪感染着我们，使我们感受到生活里面的某种真实的、动人的东西。虽然主要是通过歌词（民间音乐的歌词总是生动地描写了人民生活，细致地表现了他们的思想情绪），但歌词是依靠了具有感染力的音乐形象才更深地、更有力地感动我们的。例如听韩起祥的说唱，就是由于他的淳朴的音乐形象和他的热情而富有变化的歌声，突出地刻划了刘巧和其他人物的性格，加上他的卓越的三弦伴奏，才使我们暂时忘掉其他一切，被带进他所创造的音乐世界，跟着刘巧
    一同和封建势力斗争。听江西兴国革命山歌，那真挚的音乐，激动而带着怀念情绪的歌声，为我们展开了一幅生动的图画，使我们仿佛看到了第二次国内革命战争时期老根据地人民的革命热情无比旺盛的战斗生活。听内蒙古宝音德力格的歌唱，自然地随着她那无拘束的、充实而漫长的歌声走进了内蒙古人民的草原生活，随着她那情意深远的歌声的展开，愈益感受到她对于生活的热爱。在这些演唱中，人民情绪浸透了每个音符，其他民间音乐节目也几乎无不如此。因此大家觉得深入到生活中去体验劳动人民的思想情绪，是当前最急迫的工作，这自然是非常正确的。
    在这些优秀的民间音乐节目中，形式和内容常常结合得如此完美，丰富的生活如此生动地被表现在各种音乐形式中，使我们觉得，在民间音乐艺术中，形式和内容似乎是没有什么矛盾，似乎所有的民间艺人从来不曾感受到形式和技术的局限。当然，事实不是这样的。不过民间音乐艺术常常是根据内容去创造形式，常常是根据内容去发展技术。形式和内容的矛盾，原有的技术不能表现生活内容时，总是使形式服从内容、创造新的技术适应内容的要求。因此内容总是以适合它的形式和技术生动地被表现了出来。例如“川江船夫号子”，明显地是由于那种特殊劳动和惊险的水上生活，要求他们运用特殊的形式，结合他们的劳动形式，来表达他们长期和激流作斗争而形成的坚毅的意志和乐观主义情绪，他们便放弃了一般民歌形式，创造了“船夫号子”这样的形式。“青浦田歌”同样说明了这个问题。当地农民觉得一般民歌形式不适合他们的劳动形式（他们过去也是集体劳动的），不能满足他们的劳动情绪，因此他们创造了“田歌”这种音乐形式（这次会演中介绍的分为头歌、前么、前了、长声、赶老鸦、后么、后了、绝声等八段，但也有分为七段的，曲调也有各种不同的处理法）。在乐器演奏中也是如此。当民间艺人觉得一般的曲调不能表现“百鸟朝凤”那种欢乐的情绪的时候，就发展了吹奏技术，创造了模拟各种鸟叫的声音，插入乐曲中，以加强其欢乐的情绪。当唢呐艺人赵春亭觉得一般的唢呐音色不足以表达情绪的变化，他就改变了含哨和吹气的方法，创造了和箫、笛、三弦相似的音色；很明显地，这些创造大大发展了唢呐的吹奏技术，丰富了唢呐的表现能力，达到了进一步表现生活的目的。
    （三）
    虽然民歌，如高尔基所指出的，总是亲切地伴随着历史，并且有自己的意见，真实地反映了人民的思想情绪。但我们也不能忘记马克思所指出的，
    “统治阶级的思想，常常是统治的思想”。因此劳动人民过去在封建统治下，常常接受了某些封建统治阶级的思想。陕南山歌中有这样的词句：
        天上下雨刷刷细，
        地下穷人穿烂衣，
        十个指头有长短，
        三种树槎有高低。
    这显然是地主阶级教育穷苦劳动人民安于贫困的宿命论思想，在封建社会中，农民就接受了这种思想作为自己的思想。“走西口”中也有这样的词句：
        过河水长流，
        让人走前头，
        恐怕水深浅，
        跟人在后头。
    这是地主阶级培养起来的个人自私自利的思想，与劳动人民中普遍流传的“同舟共济”的思想截然相反。我们不能不以批评的眼光，审慎地剔除其中落后的、反人民的糟粕，吸取其优秀的、民主的精华。这里我们不能不顺便指出一种错误的思想，有人认为民间音乐艺术既是人民中生长起来的，又受到人民的喜爱，便都是好的，毋须，也不应当加以批判。这是片面的看法。肯定民间音乐的优秀传统是完全必要的，但不细加研究，不具体分析，将落后的、反人民的东西（这是封建地主阶级所渗入或受了封建地主阶级的思想影响而产生的）盲目地、笼统地都加以肯定，那是会阻碍我们正确地接受民族遗产的。
    同样，有些人对某些民间音乐不作具体分析，就给他们加上一顶非人民的帽子，全部否定。据说，福建的一种器乐合奏就因为与南戏有关，被华东某些干部戴上士大夫阶级的音乐的帽子，没有被选来参加会演。有的地方对于某些寺庙里保存的古乐，虽然原来也是民间音乐，并且本身具有重大的历史意义，如西安寺庙音乐，对于研究民间音乐的发展有很大的价值，也有人认为是封建迷信音乐不予重视，排除于研究范围以外。这种粗暴态度是很错误的，将给我们带来很多很大的损失。
    在一部分音乐干部中，也存在着另一种错误思想，认为既然肯定民间音乐具有优秀的传统，就必然是完美无疵的，因之一接触到民间音乐的某些缺点，就根本怀疑起来，甚至于反过来否定民间音乐。这次会演中演出了陕南“山歌”，“青浦田歌”和“川江船夫号子”以后，有些人认为调子高，男声用假声多，个别人个别地方唱得不很自然，于是“刺耳”、“这样高，简直超过了人声所能负担的限度”，“缺乏完整的形象”，“不仅没有打动人们的心弦，反而打乱了人们的心弦”等种种非难就起来了。其实，我们说民间音乐具有优秀的传统，是就民间音乐的全部来说的，不能因此认为任何一种民间音乐，任何一个民间艺人都能够代表优秀传统的全部；而且，即使某种民间音乐或某一民间艺人在某种程度上代表了民族音乐优秀传统的某一方面，也决不会是完美无疵的。坚持以不合实际的要求去对待民间音乐和民间艺人的表演，是错误的，只会引导我们忽视民间音乐，关闭向民间音乐学习的大门。
    （四）
    民间音乐艺人的特点，是善于以其清晰的语言鲜明地突出地表现生活情绪。这使我们的声乐家觉得需要向民间艺人学习的，主要是如何掌握思想、感情，如何掌握语言。不可否认，在控制呼吸、扩大音域、音量、装饰声音这些方面，许多受过西洋发声训练的人都有办法解决，毋须特别向民间艺人学习。但如何掌握思想感情，如何掌握语言，许多声乐工作者看得过于简单，以为只要到群众生活中去，很快就能解决，而且把这个工作看作只是一种技术工作，看不到它的思想内容，因此不从认识世界（世界观）、认识人生（人生观）着手，改造自己的思想、感情、喜爱、兴趣以及美学观点。结果，他们虽然生活在群众中，却不曾真正懂得人民的思想、感情，所以表现在演唱中的思想感情，仍然不是群众的。陶坚辛同志演唱上的失败，就是根源于他对于陕北人民怀念毛主席的感情缺乏正确的理解，以自己的不健康的情绪代替了群众的乐观主义情绪。
    （这里同时要指出陶坚辛同志在学习陕北语言运用于演唱上是成功的，但这一部分的成功不能弥补他另一方面的失败。）同样，许多人把掌握语言看作只是咬字问题，那是没有深刻了解声乐艺术中的语言的真实内容。声乐艺术中的语言，不仅要求清楚的读音（这是必要的），重要的是要生动地表现语言的情绪，因此就必然要求我们懂得歌辞的语言的全部意义和它的精神。这不仅要求我们具有文学修养，尤其要求我们对于群众生活中的语言具有无限丰富的知识，真正熟知同一语言在不同人物的口中，在不同的情绪下，语调、语势的变化和差异，并且还需要懂得如何加以艺术的夸张。像名演员周信芳、高元钧、韩起祥及其他许多优秀的民间艺人，在他们的演唱艺术中无疑地表现了他们对于语言的深刻理解、丰富知识和卓越的表现才能。他们真正掌握了语言，只有那样的语言才真正具有最大的感染力，通过他们那种生动活泼的语言，才有可能发射出生活的光辉。这需要经过长期刻苦的研究、锻炼、尤其需要具有对于生活的洞察力，才能获得。许多民间艺人在这方面确实具有不同的创造力，值得我们认真去发现，刻苦地学习。
    （五）
    这次会演中大家提出来研究的声乐问题，有的联系到过去曾经热烈争论过的问题，这里也提出来和大家研究一下。
    声乐上多年争论不休的“洋”与“土”的问题，实际上包括两个中心争论，即基本发声方法的科学与不科学问题和表现方法的倾向问题。
    虽然近代西洋唱法（因为我不了解他们中世纪的唱法，只好缩小范围）与中国自唐、宋以来的传统唱法（这是有具体材料可稽考的）的基本发声方法是相同的，但有些受过些西洋声乐训练的同志一定要说所有中国的各种唱法都是不科学的，所有民间艺人的发声都是不科学的；另外有些同志反过来说所有中国的各种唱法，所有民间艺人的唱法，只要受到群众欢迎，能够表现思想情绪的，就都是合乎科学的。相反，如果不能满足群众的要求，不能表现人民的思想情绪的，即令他受过正确的西洋发声方法的训练，他的方法就不能认为是合乎科学的，因为不能解决实际问题，科学是要解决实际问题的。实际上，这已经不是发声方法本身科学不科学的争论，而是两种不同的观念，两种不同的标尺的争论。前者认为只有受过西洋发声方法训练的，才是科学的，后者认为只有受到群众欢迎、能够解决实际问题的才是科学的，两方面都没有就发声方法本身来研究。事实上，西洋和中国的声乐家和声乐艺术中的发声方法都有合乎科学的与不合乎科学的。西洋的且不去谈它，就中国各种地方戏演员的发声方法来看，有许多地方戏的黑头，花脸，为了表现人物性格，用炸音来唱，造成特殊效果，虽然也受到群众的欢迎，他的发声，仅仅讲发声，实在是不科学的。四川高腔中帮腔的部分，有的地方唱得实在太高，听起来，唱的人十分吃力，声音十分勉强，但在群众中也受到欢迎，实在也是不科学的。东北有的皮影戏演员，也许是为了适应这种装饰意味特别浓厚的艺术形式，捏着脖子唱出一种极尖锐的声音，应该说也是不科学的，至少是违反自然发声法则的。某些文工团里某些团员，既未受过西洋发声方法的训练，也未吸取中国民间艺人的优良发声方法，在某些时候确实是直着脖子在喊叫，那也实在是不科学的。过去，许多地方剧团不允许正在变声的青年男女演员得到适当的休息，和常人一样要担负许多演唱工作，也确实是不科学的制度。有的班主或师傅，为了更多的营利，强迫着因疾病或疲劳而声音已经沙哑了的演员继续演唱，并说这样锻炼出来的声音才是铁嗓子，怎样唱也不倒嗓。这种做法，这种说法都是不科学的（如果在声音已经哑了的时候予以适当休息，不作过多演唱，声音会更圆润些）。昆曲、京戏中小生的唱法虽不一定是完全不科学的，但已经没有发展的必要，这里就不讨论了。不承认这些不科学的部分，是主观的，也是不科学的。可是除此而外，无数优秀的民间艺人运用了发声极其自然、健康而优美的声音，创造了多种多样的演唱风格，有的人更巧妙地运用了经过锻炼的清澈的假声，结合着圆润而洪大的真声，具有广阔的音域，而又运用自如。如名演员常香玉、丁果仙、许倩云、黄虹、苗族的阿泡、内蒙古的宝音德力格、哈萨克的布布苔、彝族的白秀贞、回族的朱仲禄、以及陕南山歌、青浦田歌、川江船夫号子的多数演唱者，又有什么可非议的呢？为什么不可以运用科学的观点对他们的发声方法加以分析，研究，发展我们自己的发声演唱艺术呢？为什么只能局限在近代西洋发声演唱艺术范围内呢？为什么只能承认西洋发声方法才是科学的，而我们民族的优秀的民间艺人的发声方法就一定是不科学的呢？我们必须同时承认这些民间声乐家在声乐上的巨大成就和光辉传统，这样才是公平的。认为凡是受到欢迎的就都是科学的说法，是缺乏具体分析的论断，也是不科学的。受欢迎常常有很复杂的原因，包括内容和形式以及情绪的表达等方面的问题。受欢迎的演唱者的发声有科学的，也有不科学的。决不能把这两个辞看作同义语，要加以细致的具体研究。而且群众对某些问题的认识也是有局限的。我们要肯定民间艺人在声乐上的创造和成就，也不应拒绝学习西洋近代的发声科学，如果具备条件，并且要大力提倡，让大家去掌握发声科学，以便研究民族声乐艺术中的丰富遗产，发展民族声乐艺术。科学是实践的总结，实践是多方面的，是向前发展的，科学应该建立在广泛的实践基础上，也应该是向前发展的。发声方法的科学与不科学的标准，主要看这种唱法是否发挥了，并且从各方面发展了演唱者的声音，能否帮助他获得表现各种内容所需要的声音，是否能够运用自如，他的声音是否在十分顺乎自然的情况下明显地日臻完美？不能再有其他的标准。我们在声乐上必须大力反对盲目的教条主义与狭隘的经验主义的观点。
    表现方法的倾向问题，是一个比较复杂的问题。我们在表现方法上事实上存在着现实主义的与非现实主义的两种倾向。通过去年的戏曲会演与今年的民间音乐、舞蹈会演来看民族声乐艺术传统中的表现方法的倾向性，可以肯定地说是现实主义的。而我们某些声乐家的表现方法却是非现实主义的。
    两三年来，我们并未在表现方法的主要问题——处理感情、处理语言、处理声音的基本原则，与生活的关系、民族特点等问题上展开认真的研究和讨论，仅仅纠缠在个别较次要的问题上，如假声问题。不可否认，许多新的声乐家近两三年来，在克服某些严重缺点上作了许多努力，如克服不注意思想感情，不注意语言，在声音装饰上不注意群众的习惯等，而且在这些方面有显著的改进。但实际的科学研究，远赶不上客观的需要，以致某些辛勤的、诚恳的声乐家和有前途的青年声乐学徒在研究这些问题时，得不到有力的帮助和明确的指导。
    有许多演唱者把表现方法问题看作单纯是控制声音方面的技术问题，因此认为毋须体验群众生活；又以为表现作品的思想感情主要依靠声音，可以撇开语言不管，结果技术修养越高，演唱效果越糟。这样的演唱者演唱中国歌曲（不论是民歌或创作）自然不可能得到成功。应该诚恳地说明，并非这些演唱者天生不能演唱中国歌曲，也不是所有中国歌曲都坏到不可能唤起听众的情绪，真实的原因是演唱者不是以现实主义的观点来处理演唱的，不能正确地运用自己的技术进行独立创造，所以只能把老师所教会的作品或从唱片学来的某些作品勉强唱出来。我们必须克服这种贫弱状况。必须学习民间艺人的演唱方法。民间艺人是劳动人民出身，加上长期的生活实践，使他们对于社会生活具有深刻的理解，对于各种人物的思想情绪异常熟悉，演唱时又十分注意将所体会的思想情绪，通过生动的语言，入微地表现出来，因此他们的演唱洋溢着真实的生活情绪，具有强烈的感染力。这次会演中韩起祥的“刘巧团圆”，史学杰的“反天宫”，可说是以现实主义观点处理演唱的最优秀的例子。通过这次会演使大家认识到体验群众生活，深刻地分析作品，正确地处理技术问题，是目前纠正自己的错误的重要方法。
    关于语言问题，前面已经谈过，这里就不再谈了。
    关于处理声音问题，只就目前仍在争论的问题发表一点意见，因为这个问题是声乐上“洋”“土”之争的中心问题之一，而且由新音乐工作者扩展到地方戏曲演员中去了，影响是很大的。问题的发生是由于许多受过西洋音乐教育的人习惯于听男人用真声唱，女人用假声唱，而中国民间音乐恰好相反，男声多用假声唱，一般文工团女的多用真声唱。一部分人（多是受过西洋音乐教育的）主张女的多用，甚至于全用假声唱，男的应该用真声唱；另一部分人（多是未受过西洋音乐教育的）基本上同意男的一般应用真声唱，但认为女的也应主要用真声，因为这样唱受到群众欢迎。
    根据事实来看，西洋声乐中强调女声多用假声，不是全用假声，一方面是为了扩大女声的音域，一般利用假声高音可扩大四到八、九个音；另一方面也是为了合唱中男声和女声具有鲜明的对比。应该承认这是声乐文化的发展和进步，我国京戏中青衣就多用假声（相当于西洋的女高音），须生就多用真声（相当于西洋的男高音），黑头全是真声（相当于西洋的男中音），在处理声音上京戏走向分声部，以区别不同的角色的年龄和性格，是比许多其他地方戏有很大的进步。我们应该接受这个科学的原则。说女声多用假声唱不受群众欢迎，原因主要不在真声、假声，据我所知，多半因为演唱本身缺乏情绪，情绪不饱满；当然也有因为假声缺乏锻炼，音量太小，有的因为换音区放得过低，下面一部分假音唱不出来。但不能根据这种情形就断定女声不宜用假声，那只能得出这样的结论：需要加强锻炼，或者适当提高换音区。如果不发展女声的假声，就将阻碍女声的发展，这对于声乐艺术是不利的。如果根据这意见，把京戏中演旦角的女演员改用真声唱，一定要把京戏中许多优美的演唱破坏无余。自然，强调全部用假声唱，也缩小了女声的音域，是不利于声乐艺术的发展的。有人说用假声唱咬字不易清楚，这是没有根据的，因为真声与咬字并没有必然的联系，京戏中很多女演员咬字是十分清楚的。正确的原则应该是：为使男女声音色具有鲜明的对比，扩大女声的音域，这就要求女声充分运用假声，适当运用真声，并且使两者天衣无缝地相结合。名演员常香玉的演唱可以说是说明这个原则的最好的例子。当然，我们千万不要为了要实践这个正确的原则而强迫陕南、青浦等地老百姓改变他们男声用假音较多的传统唱法。尤其希望各地地方戏的领导同志，作戏曲改革工作的负责干部不要造成一种舆论或空气强迫女演员改用真声（有的地方叫本嗓，有的地方叫平喉）演唱，更不应该像中南某些地方剧团动员女演员改用真声演唱，并要她们公开检讨不愿改用真声的思想。实际上她们不愿改用真嗓唱并不错误，错误的是干部，应该检讨的也是干部。
    还有一个问题应该提出来和大家研究一下。新的声乐家究竟采取什么方式去接受民族声乐遗产呢？有人强调每个声乐家必须实际去学好一种地方戏曲或说唱。我以为，我们只能说明实际学习一种地方戏曲或说唱，在接受民族声乐遗产上会更有实效些，但不能说实际没有唱会一种地方戏曲或说唱，就一定不能继承或接受民族声乐遗产的优秀传统。正如同现代诗人不一定非要学会做五言、七言诗，离骚或诗经式的诗，才能继承中国古典文学的遗产一样。当然，对于那些完全不懂得中国声乐艺术，甚至连听也没有听过的从外国回来的声乐家，除了听以外，实际去学习他们的演唱，一定会得到更多更深的体会，但也不能拿能不能唱好一种地方戏、一种说唱作为衡量他是否有接受民族声乐遗产的诚心的根据，因为要唱好一种地方戏或一种说唱不是一种简单的工作，有的人即使有很大的决心去学习都很难学好，而且在接受民族声乐遗产中最重要的应该是演唱方法，处理感情，处理语言，处理声音的观点问题。但是如果有人以为反正不能要求我唱好一种地方戏或说唱，因此不去认真学习地方戏曲与说唱的演唱艺术，那当然是一种错误的想法。
    （六）
    器乐方面，这次各地参加会演的节目虽不多，却充分显示了民族器乐艺术具有现实主义的优秀传统和卓越的技术。冯子存的吹笛、内蒙古舍拉西的马头琴、华北赵春亭的唢呐、潮州锣鼓、华东的合奏“百鸟朝凤”等，都是得到听众最热烈的反应的几个节目。现在从会演中大家提出的几个原则性的问题，与器乐发展方向有关的几个问题来谈谈。
    首先是对于模拟音乐的评价问题。一部分同志认为器乐曲和声乐曲一样，应当通过丰富的曲调去表现真实的感情，用生动的音乐形象给听众情绪以感染，除此以外，模拟人声唱戏也好，模拟昆虫、鸟雀及其他动物鸣叫也好，都不是器乐曲的任务；认为这种模拟只能降低器乐曲的意义，如果一定要，可以列为杂技艺术，在音乐范围内却不应提倡。但也有一部分同志认为任何一种模拟音乐都反映了一种生活情绪，也是反映生活的一种方式，所以群众需要、欢迎；而且模拟任何一种声音，都要求突破一般演奏方法，创造一种特殊演奏技巧，这样就丰富了、发展了乐器的演奏技巧，和以曲调表现生活的器乐具有同样的价值，不能说应以何者为主，何者应发展，何者不应发展。我认为前者前一部分意见是完全正确的。关于模拟音乐，应该有区别地来说，如唢呐卡戏、大擂和三弦卡戏、牛角卡戏，无论是模仿某个角色或几个角色合唱某一段戏，都能将其特定的情绪甚至腔调的气势唯妙唯肖地表达出来。这不仅是音乐，而且能够满足某些听众的戏剧要求，引起听众回忆某段戏曲所表达的情绪。这是完全可以存在的，应该可以列为一种独特的器乐形式，虽然不是器乐的主要部分（因为它所能表现的远不如人声那么真实那么完美）。至于模拟其他动物鸣叫，我认为离开了具体情况，不从模拟本身以及与全曲的关系来看，很难说模拟各种动物叫是否具有音乐性。当然，由于模拟而创造的特殊技术，是有意义的，不过不能从这一点去肯定模拟声音的音乐价值。而群众欢迎也不一定是从欣赏音乐的角度，也可能是从欣赏杂技的角度。重要的是，演奏者是从什么目的来模拟。如果像“百鸟朝凤”那样为了增加该曲的欢乐情绪而模拟鸟雀叫，或者为了其他的需要，描写特定的时间、季节、地点、能够引起听众情绪上的反应，确是经过艺术的处理，成为乐曲中不可少的部分，而且是有变化的，明确表达了一定的情绪（这是完全可能的，华东的“百鸟朝凤”之所以较中南的“百鸟朝凤”更富有音乐性，就正在这些地方），那就是以现实主义的观点来处理的，就具有音乐价值，没有理由可以反对。贝多芬不是在他的第六交响乐中非常艺术地模拟了布谷鸟叫，取得了异常优美的效果么？如果不是这样的，而是像西洋音乐中的模拟音乐“钟表店”一样，以自然主义的手法模拟钟表的音响，那是没有什么音乐价值的。不过我们对于民间艺人偶尔模拟一下，是无须加以反对，尤其不应去干涉、禁止。即使群众是从欣赏杂技的角度来欢迎，也是完全可以的（只有那种用鼻孔去吹唢呐的演奏是应该劝阻的）。只要专业的演奏者认识到，不作为一种形式而大量发展，决不会给器乐以破坏性的影响。
    有人说，有的民间艺人进城以后，思想上起了变化，管乐器上要包上白铜皮，不愿用中国乐器伴奏，言下对这样的民间艺人深为不满。是这样的民间艺人向前进了呢，还是表示不满的人太保守了呢？我以为只要这些民间艺人进城以后心中没有鄙视民间音乐，没有不愿意演奏民间乐器的思想，仅仅吸收些西洋音乐的进步因素，如采用钢琴伴奏之类，或者甚至于改良乐器，用来丰富、发展民间音乐，这是无可非议的。他们可能因为文化水平不高，缺乏现代音乐科学知识，不能处理得很好，这是不可避免的。我们没有权利可以表示不满，更不应该加以嘲笑；相反地，应该大力帮助他们提高文化水平，学习音乐科学知识，使他们有足够的能力正确地发展民间音乐。至于在乐器上包一层白铜皮，只要无损原来乐器的优美音色，那是毋须限制、反对的。
    很明显地，我们不能任民间音乐继续处在比较简陋的阶段上，也不能使它继续和世界音乐文化处于隔绝、孤立的状态，尤其不应该拒绝吸取进步的因素；必须与世界音乐文化相结合，民间音乐必须向前发展，只要它不脱离人民的基础，不背离其优秀的传统，不破坏其民族风格。否则就不免变成保守主义者，音乐上的狭隘民族主义者，这些倒是需要我们警惕，应该大力反对的。
    （七）
    不可否认，民间音乐是几千年来劳动人民的社会实践的产物，反映了他们参加社会实践的乐观主义情绪，是他们的最高智慧的结晶。今天，社会生活起了翻天覆地的变化，许多民间音乐并未因此而失去其光辉，有些早已被遗忘的曲调，解放后又被人民赋予新的生命而复活了（如华东、东北、北京、天津等地进行戏曲改革工作中发掘了许多多年不用的老调），旧社会不需要这些音乐，埋没了这些音乐，而在新社会里，它们又重新显露其光辉。但我们不能说今天仍然存在的和被发掘出来的老调能够很好地表现今天的新生活，只能说这些音乐所反映的某些生活情绪今天仍然存在，或者即使那种生活已经过去了，那种生活情绪也已成陈迹，但对于现代人仍有教育意义。某些过去人民所不曾经历过的新生活，如人民自觉地反帝国主义、反封建的斗争生活，今天人民对祖国、对伟大的人民领袖、对英雄的热爱和歌颂，人民战士的集体生活，工农劳动人民对于社会主义幸福生活的憧憬等，都不是原来的民间音乐所能胜任地表现的。所以聂耳不能不创作“义勇军进行曲”等群众歌曲，星海不能不创作“黄河大合唱”等作品，解放后，新疆各民族的口头作曲家（因他们不会记谱）苏里坦木拉脱也不能不创作“向北京致敬”，阿不克力木不能不创作“万岁！毛泽东”等无数新歌曲，以代替旧歌曲来歌颂新生活。“人民解放军进行曲”究竟不是民间歌曲所能代替的，因为过去的人民究竟缺乏由这样光荣、正确而伟大的政党和领袖领导的战斗生活所酝酿起来的新的思想情绪。这样说，丝毫不能理解为我们这一代，无论是新音乐工作者和口头作曲家，比之历史上所有的音乐家的天才都高些，也丝毫没有贬低过去的民间音乐的伟大的人民性，仅仅为了说明产生过去的民间音乐的社会实践的局限性。
    民间音乐的局限性还不止此。就表现形式来说，我们也不能不承认它的简朴，有时确实达到了简陋的程度，这是在一定的社会条件限制下形成的。也由于社会条件的限制，没有可能得到高度的综合和集中，很多时候是平铺直叙，过多重复，缺乏变化和发展，缺乏严密的组织。这些缺点正有待掌握了现代音乐科学知识的新的音乐工作者去补足、发展、丰富起来，使它达到更高的水平，更臻完美。这样说，是否降低了民间音乐的意义和价值呢？我以为她的深刻的人民性，洋溢着人民情绪的、具有高度感染力的音乐形象，简洁而具有高度概括力的音乐语言，丝毫不会因为这些局限性而被掩盖。正因为她具有如此优秀的因素，她才强烈地感动着我们，高出于我们的许多创作，才值得我们努力学习，继承和发扬。毛主席谆谆教导我们的，必须先做群众的学生，然后才能做群众的先生，这个指示是十分英明的，我们必须以这样的谦虚态度去学习民间音乐，然后虚心谨慎地去发扬她的光辉的传统！

    根据各地的经验，许多优秀的民间音乐舞蹈节目多半保存在六七十岁的老艺人身上，许多老艺人过去因在敌伪和国民党反动统治的摧残下早已改行了，多年不演出了，有的已经全部遗忘了，有的也记不全了，青年人几乎完全不知道，因此访问老艺人是目前最急迫的工作。如果不及时访问、发掘，某些民间艺术形式和某些卓越的演唱技术可能要失传了。我们不能满足于目前发掘的成绩，实际上这次参加会演的节目只是全国民间音乐中的沧海一粟。必须以热爱祖国、热爱祖国人民的高度政治热情去热爱我们祖先所创造的这些精神财富，以高度的政治热情去做访问老艺人的工作，这和到边远地区、崇山峻岭中去采矿一样，对于建设祖国具有重大的意义。
    对于老艺人必须从各方面尊重他们，这不能了解为仅仅在说话的态度上、工作的便利上和某些生活上的照顾，这些都是必要注意的。从工作上来看，更重要的是要尊重他们的艺术活动和艺术创造，具体说，要首先虚心地、细心地了解他们的艺术活动和艺术创造的全部，必须诱发他们，不能有任何强迫，使他们真正无所顾忌地、并且乐于为我们表演他们所熟悉的节目。这样我们才有可能了解他们的艺术的真实情况，才有可能正确估计他们所保存的音乐遗产的价值。当然，我们也必须使他们了解我们发掘民间音乐舞蹈艺术的真实意义，和旧时代为娱乐而娱乐的目的不同，适当地告诉他们音乐舞蹈这种娱乐形式是鼓舞人民向前，教育人民的最好的形式，这样他们自己就会去掉那些低级的、色情的封建因素，使得民间艺术愈加光辉地显露出人民形象。我们还必须注意，不要简单地、粗暴地、机械地要求民间音乐、舞蹈与当前的中心工作任务相结合、这样就可以避免某些年轻的干部和年轻的艺人的“好意地”修改，实际上是对于民间艺术的破坏。据说西北、中南某些地区的干部禁止艺人唱情歌中原来十分优美的歌辞、强迫民间艺人装上些生硬、粗糙的新词，如歌唱婚姻法，保卫和平等现实政治主题，这些粗暴的行为必须停止，领导上应当注意进行教育。
    我们的工作不能停留在发掘上，从老艺人那里发现了优秀节目，就应当马上组织青年艺人或专业文艺工作干部向他们学习，在某些情况下，并且应该组织专家进行深入地调查、访问，马上记录其中重要部分，并进行研究。一九五○年中央音乐学院研究部曾去无锡请卓越的民间艺人华彦均（二胡、琵琶专家）录音，当时没有马上仔细研究其演奏技术，到后来想到要研究其某些演奏技术时，华彦均不幸已经病逝了。这是很大的损失。今后必须避免这样的损失。
