Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, July 31st: Following the complete withdrawal of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army frontline troops from the demilitarized zone before 22:00 on July 30th, in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, they have built new "home away from home" on the new positions and started a new life.

	On the new positions, our soldiers have built trenches, telephone operators have connected lines to artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, and tank units, and automatic riflemen are vigilantly patrolling along the northern edge of the demilitarized zone day and night.

	In many low-lying areas of the new positions, our cooks have set up dining halls using raincloth as tents and are making dining tables out of wooden boards. Near the ditches, the soldiers have also built bathhouses with wooden boards. On some positions, the soldiers have also built clubs, filled with banners awarded by higher authorities to the heroic soldiers. On some positions, the soldiers are also preparing to build ball fields and playgrounds for cultural entertainment and sports activities.

	On the new positions, in many places, our soldiers are sitting in the woods or tents, enthusiastically discussing the current situation and tasks. The soldiers generally believe that the realization of the Korean armistice is the result of the heroic struggle of the Korean and Chinese people's troops with the strong support of the Korean and Chinese people and the people of the world. However, this is only the first step in peacefully resolving the Korean issue. Some warmongers in the United States, especially the Syngman Rhee clique, are still against the signing of the armistice agreement. Therefore, we must maintain high vigilance, strengthen our preparedness, and strive to ensure the complete implementation of the armistice agreement.

	Now, next to the wooden signs marking the "northern edge of the demilitarized zone," on the hilltops and at key intersections, peace-keeping sentries are firmly gripping their guns, vigilantly watching the South.

    我军按照停战协定全部撤离非军事区
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十一日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军前线部队遵照停战协定于七月三十日二十二时前全部撤出非军事区以后，已在新阵地上建起了新的“阵地之家”，开始了新的生活。
    在新阵地上，我军战士们修起了交通壕，电话员接通了通往炮兵、高射炮兵和坦克部队的线路，自动枪手沿着非军事区北缘的边沿日夜警惕地巡逻着。
    我军炊事员们在许多新阵地的低洼处用雨布做帐篷搭起了饭堂，并且正在用木板制作饭桌。在河沟附近，战士们还用木板盖起澡堂。有的阵地上的战士们还修起了俱乐部，里面摆满了上级奖给英勇作战的战士们的锦旗。有的阵地上，战士们还准备建设球场、操场，以便开展文化娱乐和体育活动。
    在新阵地上，许多地方的我军战士们坐在树林子里或帐篷里，热烈讨论着当前的形势和任务。战士们普遍认为：朝鲜停战的实现，是朝中人民部队在朝中人民与全世界人民的大力支援下英勇斗争的结果，但这还只是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步，美国的一部分好战分子尤其是李承晚集团还在反对停战协定的签订。因此必须保持高度警惕，加强戒备，为保障停战协定的彻底实现而奋斗。
    现在，在标志着“非军事区北缘”的木牌旁，在山头和要道口上，保卫和平的哨兵们正紧握着枪，警惕地注视着南方。
