Harbin Railway Bureau
    Equitably Completes July Loading Plan
    The Harbin Railway Bureau completed its July loading plan in a very balanced manner. The whole month exceeded the plan by 7.9 percent. The balanced completion of the Harbin Railway Bureau's July loading plan ensured the timely supply of basic construction materials and disaster relief grain into Shanhaiguan.
    At the beginning of July, the Harbin Railway Bureau convened a meeting of cargo owners. Based on the shipping requests put forward by the cargo owners, the bureau compared these with the source of goods. Afterwards, it promptly checked the cargo owners' proposal and implementation of the "Five-Day Shipping Plan" and urged them to improve it. At the same time, it checked whether the railway had allocated the required number of vehicles according to the shipping plan. This balanced the operations and avoided vehicle waste. In order to balance loading, the bureau also took effective measures in July to strengthen night loading operations, making the number of vehicles loaded at night reach 36.5 percent of the number loaded in a day.
    In addition, the bureau also improved vehicle utilization efficiency by forming direct trains, strengthening unloading operations, and strengthening night loading operations to ensure the balanced completion of the loading plan. After strengthening unloading operations, the number of vehicles waiting to be unloaded decreased by 25.1 percent compared with June, changing the past situation where loaded vehicles arrived suddenly and could not be unloaded in time, resulting in vehicle backlog.
    Due to the strengthening of the above work and other improvements, the Harbin Railway Bureau's comprehensive indicator in July—vehicle turnaround time—was shortened by 0.12 days compared with the plan, requiring only 1.91 days for one turnaround. (Xinhua News Agency)

    哈尔滨铁路局
    均衡地完成七月份装车计划
    哈尔滨铁路管理局七月份的装车计划完成得很均衡。全月超额百分之七点九；哈尔滨铁路管理局均衡地完成七月份装车计划，使各地基本建设材料和进关救灾粮得到了及时的供应。
    哈尔滨铁路管理局在七月初曾经召开了货主会议，根据货主所提出的托运要求，对照了货源；以后又及时地检查货主提出和执行“五日托运计划”的情况，并加以督促，同时检查铁路方面是否按托运计划配齐了车辆；使作业均衡，避免了车辆浪费。为了平衡装车，该局七月份还采取有效措施加强了夜间装车作业，使夜间装车数达到了一昼夜装车数的百分之三十六点五。
    另外，该局又以编组直达列车、加强卸车作业和夜间装车作业的方法，提高车辆运用效率，以保证装车计划的均衡完成。卸车作业加强以后，待卸车比六月份减少了百分之二十五点一，改变了过去重车突然集中到达而不能及时卸车以致积压车辆的情况。
    由于上述工作的加强以及其他方面的改进，哈尔滨铁路管理局七月份的综合指标——车辆周转时间比计划缩短了零点一二天，只需要一点九一天就可以周转一次。        （新华社）
