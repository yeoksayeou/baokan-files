    Representatives from various regions who attended the Second National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League conveyed the various resolutions of the Congress to the broad masses of Youth League members.
    Representatives of the Youth League organizations of various provinces, cities, factories, and mines in North China, Northeast China, East China, Central South China, Northwest China, and Southwest China reported the situation of the Congress to the local CCP committees and conveyed the instructions of the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao on the work of the Youth League immediately after returning to their respective areas. They all received the warm concern and guidance of the Party committees. Wang Congwu, First Deputy Secretary of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, also gave instructions on how to convey the resolutions of the Congress, rectify the Youth League organizations in North China, and train cadres. After listening to the report of the Southwest Work Committee of the Youth League, the Southwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee immediately issued "Several Opinions on the Conveyance Work of the Second National Congress of the Youth League" to the Party committees of various provinces and cities, and at the same time studied the conveyance plan for the first-level organs in the Southwest Region. The Youth League committees of Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, and Guizhou Provinces and the Chongqing Municipal Committee also reported to the Party committees at the same level one after another, and obtained the close support and help of the Party committees.
    In mid and late July, the representatives from various regions, in light of the current work and local specific conditions, conveyed the spirit and resolutions of the Second National Congress of the Youth League to the Youth League members. The representatives of the directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government who attended the Youth League Congress made a report to the cadres above the level of branch secretary of the directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government on July 24. The East China Work Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Youth League respectively held meetings where the representatives of the East China Region and Shanghai City who attended the Youth League Congress made reports. The Southwest Work Committee of the Youth League held four member meetings to make reports to the members of the finance and economics, culture and education, and political and legal departments of the Southwest Administrative Committee and the Southwest People's Revolutionary University, with approximately 10,000 people participating. The Youth League organizations of Sichuan, Xikang, and other provinces and Chongqing, Chengdu, Tianjin and other cities have made reports to the cadres of the organs. The representatives of Heilongjiang Province and Kunming City who attended the Youth League Congress went to factories, rural areas, organs, and schools to make reports. Ge Buhai, Deputy Secretary of the North China Work Committee of the Youth League, and cadres of various departments went to the North China provinces, cities (districts) to inspect the conveyance and implementation. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Youth League also led cadres, led by the secretary and ministers, to go deep into key counties and key factories and mines to combine inspection work and carry out conveyance.
    After listening to the reports, the Youth League members in various regions enthusiastically launched studies and, in conjunction with inspecting their own work, formulated future work plans. Many local Youth League cadres and members were deeply moved by the care and love of the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the work of the Youth League, and felt that the direction of the Youth League work was clearer and that the sense of responsibility for the work was strengthened. Cadres who were not at ease with the work of the Youth League in the past also began to realize the importance of the work of the League, saw the future of the work, and improved their confidence in their work.

    向广大青年团员传达大会决议
    出席中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会的各地代表，认真地向广大青年团员传达了代表大会的各项决议。
    华北、东北、华东、中南、西北和西南等地区的各省、市和工厂、矿山中青年团组织的代表，回到当地后，立即向当地中共党委汇报了大会情况，传达了中共中央和毛主席对青年团工作的指示，他们都得到了党委的亲切关怀和指导。中共中央华北局第一副书记王从吾，并对如何传达大会决议，以及整顿华北地区青年团组织、培养干部等问题，都作了指示。中共中央西南局在听了青年团西南工作委员会的汇报后，随即向各省、市党委发出了“关于青年团第二次全国代表大会传达工作的几点意见”的指示，同时研究了西南区一级机关的传达计划。青年团四川、西康、云南、贵州省委及重庆市委也都先后向同级党委作了汇报，取得了党委的密切支持与帮助。
    各地代表分别在七月中旬和下旬，结合当前工作和当地具体情况，将青年团第二次全国代表大会的精神和决议向青年团员作了传达。出席青年团代表大会的中央人民政府直属机关的代表，在七月二十四日向中央人民政府直属机关团支部书记以上的干部作了传达。青年团华东工作委员会和上海市委员会，分别召开会议由出席团代表大会的华东区和上海市代表进行传达。青年团西南工作委员会曾召开四次团员大会，向西南行政委员会的财经、文教、政法等部门和西南人民革命大学的团员作了传达，参加大会的约一万人。四川、西康等省及重庆、成都、天津等市团的组织已在机关干部中作了传达。参加团代表大会的黑龙江省代表、昆明市代表都分别到工厂、农村、机关、学校进行传达。青年团华北工作委员会副书记葛步海和各部干部分赴华北各省、市（地）委检查传达和贯彻情况。青年团河北省委也由书记和部长率领干部深入重点县和重点厂、矿结合检查工作进行传达。
    各地青年团员在听过传达以后，都热烈地展开了学习，并结合检查自己的工作，订出了今后工作计划。许多地方团的干部和团员深为中共中央和毛主席对青年团工作的关怀与爱护所感动，并且觉得今后对团的工作方向更明确了，更加强了工作的责任感。过去不安心青年团工作的干部也开始认识到团的工作的重要，看到了工作前途，提高了工作信心。     （新华社）
