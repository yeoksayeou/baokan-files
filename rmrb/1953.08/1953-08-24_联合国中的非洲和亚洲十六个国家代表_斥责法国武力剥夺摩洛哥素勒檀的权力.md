Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: According to TASS, New York, August 22nd: Representatives of sixteen African and Asian countries in the United Nations held a press conference. Syrian representative,宰尼丁 (Zǎiní dīng), stated at the press conference that the sixteen African and Asian countries were deeply concerned about the developments in Morocco, which had culminated in the exile of the Sultan of Morocco. 宰尼丁 (Zǎiní dīng) pointed out that the French government exiled the Sultan of Morocco because he refused to consider the so-called "reform" decrees, which would not only fail to establish a democratic representative government but would also worsen the plight of the Moroccan people.

宰尼丁 (Zǎiní dīng) said that the African and Asian group of nations was closely monitoring the development of the situation in Morocco and believed that the French policy was inconsistent with the principles of the United Nations and was impractical. He said that the African and Asian group of nations (including Afghanistan, Burma, Egypt, Abyssinia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Thailand, and Yemen) "has strongly supported in the past, and continues to support, the struggle of the Sultan of Morocco and the Moroccan people for freedom. They are studying all effective actions that can be taken to resolve this issue. They are uneasy about the situation that could undermine peace in Morocco and have an adverse impact on the world situation."

Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: French colonialists forcibly deprived the Sultan of Morocco,西迪·穆罕默德·本·优素福 (Xī dí·Mùhǎnmòdé·Běn·Yōusùfú), of his power on the 20th and supported the pro-French分子西迪·穆罕默德·乌德·麦莱·阿拉法 (Fènzǐ Xī dí·Mùhǎnmòdé·Wūdé·Màilái·Ālāfǎ) to ascend to the throne as the new Sultan. (Note: The Sultan is the religious and political leader of Morocco.)

本·优素福 (Běn·Yōusùfú) sympathized with the Moroccan nationalist movement and, with the support of the nationalist party Independence Party, repeatedly resisted the so-called "reform" measures of the French colonialists to strengthen their colonial rule over Morocco. Therefore, the French colonialists plotted to abolish 本·优素福 (Běn·Yōusùfú)'s Sultan position. They supported the power of the pro-French chieftain 格拉维 (Gélāwéi), and used the Berber armed forces under 格拉维 (Gélāwéi)'s control to coerce 本·优素福 (Běn·Yōusùfú). As early as April of this year, 格拉维 (Gélāwéi), at the instigation of the French, gathered a group of local officials appointed by the French Governor-General and openly announced that he would expel 本·优素福 (Běn·Yōusùfú). By mid-August, they announced that they would take violent action. At this time, the French Resident-General in Morocco, 纪尧姆 (Jìyáomǔ), coerced the Sultan into signing the enslaving "reform" decrees on the 13th. On the 15th, 格拉维 (Gélāwéi) and more than three hundred local officials and elders announced the deprivation of the Sultan's religious supreme leadership power and the establishment of 阿拉法 (Ālāfǎ), a member of 本·优素福 (Běn·Yōusùfú)'s tribe, as the supreme religious leader. At the same time, the armed Berber people under 格拉维 (Gélāwéi)'s command began to advance towards Rabat, the capital of Morocco. Five days later, 纪尧姆 (Jìyáomǔ) returned from Paris after receiving instructions and ordered tanks, armored vehicles, and heavy troops to surround the Sultan's palace. An hour later, the Sultan and his son were put on a French military aircraft and exiled to Corsica in the Mediterranean. Then 纪尧姆 (Jìyáomǔ) issued a statement, proclaiming 阿拉法 (Ālāfǎ) as the new Sultan.

Since 格拉维 (Gélāwéi) announced the deprivation of the Sultan's religious leadership power, the situation in Morocco has been very tense. The French colonial authorities sent troops to guard traffic arteries and all strategic locations, implemented a strict news blockade, and dispatched reconnaissance planes and nearly a hundred tanks for patrols everywhere. In Casablanca, Rabat, Fez, Marrakesh, and eastern Morocco, bloody incidents of clashes between demonstrators and military police occurred everywhere. A large number of Moroccan patriotic people were arrested. On the 20th, Tangier also held a demonstration, and stores were tightly shuttered.

The French colonialists' action of forcibly exiling the Sultan of Morocco has aroused widespread protests from Arab countries. The Arab League headquarters held a meeting on the 21st and decided to notify all Arab countries to "take urgent measures regarding the terrible events in Morocco." The Deputy Secretary-General of the Arab League told the Egyptian press that the governments of the Arab countries had lodged protests with the governments of France, Britain, and the United States. The Cairo Muslim Brotherhood called on all Arab and Islamic countries to implement economic and cultural boycotts against France. Representatives of fifteen Asian and African countries in the United Nations accused France before the Security Council of actions in Morocco that endanger world peace.

    联合国中的非洲和亚洲十六个国家代表
    斥责法国武力剥夺摩洛哥素勒檀的权力
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：联合国中非洲和亚洲十六个国家的代表举行了一次记者招待会，叙利亚代表宰尼丁在记者招待会上表示：非洲和亚洲十六个国家对于摩洛哥局势的发展深表忧虑，这个局势由于摩洛哥素勒檀的被放逐而发展到高潮。宰尼丁指出，法国政府放逐摩洛哥素勒檀是因为他拒绝考虑所谓“改革”法令，这个法令不但无助于建立一个民主的代议制政权，反而会使摩洛哥人民的处境愈益恶化。
    宰尼丁说，非洲和亚洲国家集团正密切注意摩洛哥形势的发展，并认为：法国的政策不符合于联合国的原则，并且是不实际的。他说，非洲和亚洲国家集团（包括阿富汗、缅甸、埃及、阿比西尼亚、印度、印尼、伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩、利比里亚、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、泰国和也门）“在过去曾极力支持，现在仍然支持摩洛哥素勒檀和摩洛哥人民争取自由的斗争。它们正在研究所能采取的一切有效行动，以求解决这个问题。它们对于可能破坏摩洛哥的和平并对世界局势产生不利影响的局势感到不安”。
   【新华社二十三日讯】法国殖民者在二十日用武力剥夺了摩洛哥素勒檀西迪·穆罕默德·本·优素福的权力，而扶持亲法分子西迪·穆罕默德·乌德·麦莱·阿拉法登位为新素勒檀。（按：素勒檀是摩洛哥的宗教和政治首领）
    本·优素福同情摩洛哥民族主义运动，在民族主义政党独立党支持下一再抗拒了法国殖民者加强对摩洛哥的殖民统治的所谓“改革”办法。因此，法国殖民者就策划废除本·优素福的素勒檀职位。他们扶植亲法的酋长格拉维的势力，利用格拉维控制下的柏伯尔人武装，来挟持本·优素福。早在今年四月，格拉维就在法国唆使下纠合了一批由法国总督任命的土官，公然宣布要驱逐本·优素福。到八月中旬并宣布要采取暴力行动。这时，法国驻摩洛哥总督纪尧姆就胁迫素勒檀在十三日签署了奴役性的“改革”法令。到十五日，格拉维和三百多个土官、长老等宣布剥夺素勒檀的宗教最高领袖权力，而另立本·优素福的同族阿拉法为宗教最高领袖。同时，格拉维手下的武装柏伯尔人开始向摩洛哥首府拉巴特进迫。五天后，纪尧姆从巴黎接受训令归来，就下令用坦克、装甲车和重兵包围素勒檀的宫殿，一小时后，素勒檀和他的儿子就被押上法国军用飞机，放逐到地中海的科西嘉岛去了。接着纪尧姆就发表声明，以阿拉法为新的素勒檀。
    从格拉维宣布剥夺素勒檀的宗教领袖权力起，摩洛哥局势就非常紧张。法国殖民当局派军队把守交通要道及一切战略要地，实施严格的新闻封锁，并且出动侦察机和近百辆坦克到处巡逻。在卡萨布兰卡、拉巴特、非斯、马拉喀什和摩洛哥东部地方，到处发生示威群众和军警冲突的流血事件。大批摩洛哥爱国人民被捕。二十日，丹吉尔也举行了示威，商店都紧闭店门。
    法国殖民者武力放逐摩洛哥素勒檀的行动，引起阿拉伯国家的广泛抗议。阿拉伯联盟总部在二十一日举行了会议，决定通知一切阿拉伯国家“就摩洛哥的可怕事件采取紧急措施”。阿拉伯联盟副秘书长告诉埃及报界说：阿拉伯国家的政府已经向法国、英国和美国政府提出了抗议。联合国中亚洲和非洲十五国代表向安全理事会控告法国在摩洛哥的行动危害世界和平。开罗回教兄弟会要求各阿拉伯国家和回教国家在经济、文化方面对法国实行抵制。
