Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 1st: On August 1st, the leadership organs and directly subordinate units of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) held a joint military-civilian celebration meeting with the local Korean people to warmly celebrate the great victory of the Korean and Chinese people in defending peace and opposing aggression.

    General Yang Dezhi, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, General Li Zhimin, Director of the Political Department, and General Zhang Nansheng, Deputy Director, attended the meeting. Major General Xu Fenghua, representative of the Korean People's Army, was also invited to attend.

    General Yang Dezhi spoke at the meeting. He first expressed warm congratulations on the great victory of the Korean and Chinese people in defending peace and opposing aggression. He especially expressed deep admiration for the heroic struggle waged by the heroic Korean people under the leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung against the aggressors. He said: Now the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have, in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, completely withdrawn from the demilitarized zone, and will continue to faithfully implement and abide by all the provisions of the Armistice Agreement. However, the warmongering elements of U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique are still plotting to undermine the armistice. Therefore, the full implementation of the Armistice Agreement and further peaceful settlement of the Korean issue still require arduous struggle. The Chinese People's Volunteers must still firmly unite with the Korean people and continue to work tirelessly to accomplish this glorious and arduous task.

    General Yang Dezhi finally said: When we celebrate the victory today, we must not forget the sincere love and enthusiastic support of the Korean people for the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Chinese People's Volunteers must continue to strengthen unity with the Korean people, cherish every mountain, every river, every blade of grass, and every tree of Korea, help the Korean people who have suffered from the war to carry out rehabilitation work, and continue to consolidate and strengthen the fighting friendship between the Korean and Chinese people cemented with blood. He also expressed sincere gratitude and high respect on behalf of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army under the leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung.

    After General Yang Dezhi finished speaking, two Korean mothers walked onto the rostrum with two five-year-old Korean girls and presented flowers to the leaders of the Chinese People's Volunteers. When General Yang Dezhi and General Li Zhimin warmly picked up the Korean little girls presenting flowers, a burst of warm applause immediately rang out in the venue.

    Next, Major General Xu Fenghua, representative of the Korean People's Army, spoke. He congratulated the great victory of the world's peace and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union in opposing aggression and defending peace, and wished the fighting friendship between the people of Korea and China to be more consolidated and developed.

    Zhao Junyong, representative of the local Korean people and chairman of a certain county committee of the Korean Workers' Party, spoke. He expressed his high respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers on behalf of all the party members and all the people in the county. He said: The incomparably heroic fighting spirit and heroic behavior displayed by the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield have inspired the Korean people to advance towards victory! He then said: After the Korean armistice is realized, the Korean people must still raise their revolutionary vigilance at all times and watch the enemy's every move with sharp eyes. The Korean people have full awareness and determination to do everything possible to consolidate national defense, rapidly restore production, and heal the war wounds caused by the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Korea.

    The meeting ended in a warm atmosphere of close unity between the Chinese and Korean military and civilians.

    An entertainment evening was held after the meeting. The Korean Central Broadcasting Station Art Troupe, the Korean Central Farmers' Theater Troupe, and the First Troupe of the Chinese People's Anti-American Aid Korea General Association's Cultural Work Troupe to Korea jointly performed wonderful programs.

    志愿军领导机关及直属部队与朝鲜人民联合举行大会
    庆祝保卫和平反对侵略斗争的伟大胜利
    【新华社朝鲜前线一日电】中国人民志愿军领导机关及直属部队于八月一日与驻地朝鲜人民举行军民联合庆祝大会，热烈庆祝朝中人民保卫和平、反侵略斗争的伟大胜利。
    中国人民志愿军副司令员杨得志将军、政治部主任李志民将军、副主任张南生将军等参加了大会。朝鲜人民军代表许凤学少将也应邀参加了大会。
    杨得志将军在会上讲话。他首先对朝中人民保卫和平、反侵略斗争的伟大胜利，表示热烈的庆贺。他特别对英雄的朝鲜人民在金日成首相的领导下向侵略者所进行的英勇斗争，深表赞佩。他说：现在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军已经按照停战协定，全部撤离了非军事区，并且将继续忠诚地执行和遵守停战协定的全部条款。但美帝国主义好战分子和李承晚集团仍在阴谋破坏停战。因此，全部实现停战协定，并进一步和平解决朝鲜问题，还须要进行艰苦的斗争，中国人民志愿军仍然要坚定地与朝鲜人民团结在一起，为完成这一光荣而艰巨的任务而继续不懈地奋斗。
    杨得志将军最后说：当今天庆祝胜利的时候，我们不能忘记朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军的衷心爱护和热情支援。中国人民志愿军一定要继续加强与朝鲜人民的团结，爱护朝鲜人民的一山一水，一草一木，帮助深受战争灾难的朝鲜人民进行恢复工作，继续巩固与加强朝中人民以鲜血凝结起来的战斗友谊。他并代表中国人民志愿军向在金日成首相领导下的英勇的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    杨得志将军讲完话以后，两位朝鲜母亲抱着两个五岁的朝鲜女孩走上主席台，向中国人民志愿军首长献花。当杨得志将军和李志民将军热情地把献花的朝鲜小女孩抱起的时候，会场上顿时响起了一阵热烈的掌声。
    接着，朝鲜人民军代表许凤学少将讲话。他庆贺以苏联为首的全世界和平民主力量反对侵略、保卫和平的伟大胜利，并祝朝中两国人民的战斗友谊更加巩固和发展。
    当地朝鲜人民代表、朝鲜劳动党某郡委员长赵君用讲话。他代表该郡全体劳动党员和全体人民向中国人民志愿军表示崇高的敬意。他说：中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上所发挥的英勇无比的斗争精神和所表现的英勇行为，鼓舞着朝鲜人民向胜利前进！他接着说：在朝鲜停战实现后，朝鲜人民仍要时时刻刻提高革命警惕性，以尖锐的眼光来注视敌人的一举一动。朝鲜人民有充分的自觉和决心，尽一切力量巩固国防，迅速恢复生产，医治美帝国主义侵朝战争所造成的战争创伤。
    大会在中朝军民亲密团结的热烈气氛中结束。
    会后举行游艺晚会。朝鲜中央广播电台艺术团、朝鲜中央农民剧团和中国人民抗美援朝总会赴朝慰问文艺工作团第一团联合演出了精彩节目。
