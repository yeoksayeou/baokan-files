Why is the production mood of farmers in Xingyi County, Guizhou still unstable more than a year after the land reform? Why are middle peasants still afraid of "revealing their wealth" and even poor and lower-middle peasants afraid of "standing out"? Why do middle peasants still sell their cattle, hide the amount of accumulated fertilizer, and even sell the purchased oil cake (fertilizer) when the production movement has begun? Recently, we investigated some situations in nine ordinary villages. Judging from these nine villages, the main reason why farmers' enthusiasm for production has not been brought into play is that the interests of middle peasants have been seriously infringed upon. The forms of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants vary from village to village, but the law of development is roughly the same. In villages with more problems, middle peasants whose interests have been infringed upon account for 35% of the total number of middle peasant households; in one village, three middle peasant households were encroached upon 21 *shi* of grain, equivalent to more than 3.4 million yuan in Renminbi.

Not long after liberation, in order to solve the production and living difficulties of poor peasants, the People's Government called for the development of "free lending." However, due to the one-sided perspective of some cadres towards the poor and lower-middle peasants and the inaccurate implementation of policies, "free lending" became "forced lending" in reality. This is the case in every village we inspected. For example, in April 1951, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the seventh team of Xiawangtun Village, Second District, went directly to the home of middle peasant Cao Mingfang under the banner of "free lending," and regardless of whether he was willing or not, they took 10 *shi* out of his 12 *shi* of grain and divided it up. In September 1951, during the autumn tax collection, cadres in Longjing Village, Seventh District, used the method of "clearing black grain" to "search" out 13 *shi* of grain from six middle peasant households and "borrowed" it by force. Not only was no interest paid on the grain borrowed by force, but in many cases, even the principal has not been returned to this day.

During the land reform, cadres had a relatively clear understanding of the policy of uniting with middle peasants, and they also knew that they should "not exclude them politically and not infringe on them economically." However, in actual work, some things that infringed on the interests of middle peasants still occurred. After the land reform, through review, the Party's policy of uniting with middle peasants was further implemented in the countryside. However, there are still things that infringe on the interests of middle peasants in production, especially within mutual aid teams. There is a saying circulating in the countryside: "You can only pile up if you suffer losses." Some middle peasants are afraid of suffering losses and do not participate in mutual aid teams. There are ten kinds of things in which mutual aid teams take advantage of middle peasants in four villages: (1) holding meetings in the homes of middle peasants and using their oil (about 200-300 yuan per night); (2) asking middle peasant members to pay for ordering "Guizhou Peasant News" or buying other books and newspapers; (3) "visiting" middle peasant homes, warming themselves by the fire, smoking, and drinking water (sweet rice wine water in the summer); (4) poor and lower-middle peasants can delay payment in mutual aid team settlements, but middle peasants must pay immediately even if they have difficulties; (5) taking children to eat when working at the homes of middle peasant members (poor and lower-middle peasants say: they have it, what does it matter if the children eat a little food!); (6) using the farm tools of middle peasants without compensation, and rarely giving reasonable compensation, or even no compensation, when they are damaged; (7) underestimating the work points of middle peasant members and overestimating the work points of helping middle peasants, and even raising the value of work points that middle peasants should contribute; (8) not giving loans to middle peasants, and even taking back loans that have been given to middle peasants and giving them to poor and lower-middle peasants; (9) underestimating the value of cattle and using the cheap cattle of middle peasant members; (10) asking middle peasant members to feed the group's public pigs (sows), only giving them subsidies when piglets are born, and the rest of the feed must be provided by the middle peasants.

These situations have seriously affected the production enthusiasm of middle peasants; in addition, bad elements take the opportunity to exploit loopholes, create rumors, and seriously damage production. In a village in the Second District, a middle peasant did not participate in the mutual aid team because he was afraid of damaging his farm tools, and as a result, the crops in the field could not be harvested and suffered losses. Cha Wangshi, a middle peasant in Mulong Village, Eighth District, was deceived by bad elements in March this year, fearing "returning to the big pile," sold his cattle, and the family cried together, having no heart to engage in production. Zhang Jiquan, a middle peasant in Bishan Village, Second District, also wanted to sell his cattle (complaining about the low assessment). Some middle peasants are afraid of "free lending" and complain everywhere; even if they still have three or five *shi* of grain at home, they shout "out of food" and demand relief. On the other hand, some middle peasants lack food and have no strength to weed and transplant rice seedlings. They wanted to borrow some grain, but they could not borrow it or dared not say it, which resulted in delays in production. Many middle peasants organized mutual aid teams separately (fearing that poor and lower-middle peasants would "occupy" them); in this way, even the production of poor and lower-middle peasants was affected. In the countryside, there are still many middle peasants who dare not speak, are unwilling to speak, and are afraid of being excluded. This time, the middle peasants heard us publicize the policy and said, "This is great, now we can sleep soundly!"

Although the middle peasants whose interests have been infringed upon are only a part of the middle peasants, can it be said that this will not affect the entire middle peasant class and will not damage production? Poor and lower-middle peasants see that there is no benefit in developing into middle peasants, who will be willing to work hard in production? If we cannot consolidate and unite all middle peasants, how can we achieve comprehensive production increase and implement truly democratic universal suffrage? After studying policies and conducting in-depth inspection of work, cadres at all levels in Xingyi County have now generally paid attention to this issue and have begun to correct this deviation in conjunction with production, giving middle peasants the necessary support and care in loans and other aspects, and earnestly educating poor and lower-middle peasants to actively and consciously unite with middle peasants, not to exclude them politically (paying special attention in the general election), and not to infringe on them economically. We must use facts to make all peasants believe in the Party and the government's various policies so that the production enthusiasm of all peasants can be fully brought into play.

    贵州兴义县农民生产情绪为什么不稳定
    萧其苏
    贵州兴义县农民的生产情绪为什么在土地改革后一年多的今天还不稳定呢？为什么中农还怕“露帛”甚至贫雇农也怕“冒尖”呢？生产运动开展了，为什么中农还要卖牛，还隐瞒积肥的数量，甚至把买得的油枯（肥料）还要卖掉呢？最近我们调查了九个一般的村子的一些情况。从这九个村来看，农民生产积极性没有发挥出来的主要原因是中农的利益受了比较严重的侵害。各村侵犯中农利益的形式是多样的，而发展的规律则大体上是一致的。其中问题比较多的村，被侵犯利益的中农占中农总户数的百分之三十五；有一个村的三户中农就被侵占谷子二十一石，合人民币三百四十多万元。
    解放后不久，人民政府为了解决贫苦农民生产上生活上的困难，曾号召开展“自由借贷”。可是，由于许多干部有片面的贫雇观点，没有准确地贯彻政策，弄成“自由借贷”其名，“强迫借贷”是实。这是我们检查的每一个村都有的事。如一九五一年四月，二区下王屯村七组的贫雇农打着“自由借贷”的旗子，迳直去中农曹明方家，不管是否愿意，不由分说，就从他家十二石谷子中取出十石分借了。七区龙井九村在一九五一年九月秋征时，干部用“清黑粮”的方式，“搜查”出六户中农的十三石谷子强“借”了。强借粮食不但不付利息，有很多直到如今连本都不归还。
    在土地改革中，干部对于团结中农的政策是比较认识明确了，也知道应当“政治上不排挤，经济上不侵犯”，可是在实际工作中，还是发生了一些侵犯中农利益的事情。土地改革结束后，又经过复查，党的团结中农政策在农村中是进一步贯彻了。但是，在生产中侵犯中农利益的事，还是有的，特别是在互助组内。农村中流传着“吃得亏才打得堆”的说法。有部分中农怕吃亏，就不参加互助组了。互助组内揩中农的油的事，在四个村中就有十种：（1）组内开会在中农家，点中农的油（每晚约需二、三百元）；（2）组内订“贵州农民报”或买其他书报等，要中农组员出钱；（3）到中农家“串门子”，烤火，吃烟，喝水（夏天的甜酒水）；（4）互助组内结帐贫雇农可以拖欠，中农有困难也必须立即付清；（5）到中农组员家做活，带小孩子去吃饭；（贫雇农们说：他们有，小孩吃点饭算什么！）（6）无代价地用中农的农具，用烂了也很少合理赔偿，甚至不赔；（7）少评中农组员做活的工分，多评帮中农做活的工分，有的甚至把中农应出的工分分值提高；（8）贷款不评给中农，有的将已评给中农的又拿给了贫雇农；（9）将牛分评得低，用中农组员的便宜牛；（10）组内叫中农组员喂全组公有的猪（老母猪），只在下小猪的时候给他们补助，其余的饲料都要中农出。
    这些情形严重地影响了中农的生产积极性；再加上有坏分子趁机钻空子，造谣生事，严重地损害了生产。二区有个村的中农因为怕把农具用坏而没有参加互助组，结果庄稼在地里收不完，遭受了损失。八区木拢村中农查王氏，今年三月间受了坏分子的欺骗，怕“归大堆”，把耕牛卖去，一家哭成一团，无心肠搞生产。二区笔山村中农张继全也要将牛卖掉（嫌评分低）。有些中农怕“自由借贷”，到处叫苦；家中还有三几石粮食，就喊“断粮”，要求救济。另一方面，也有些中农缺吃的，没有力气薅草、插秧，本想借点粮，可是也不能借或者不敢说出来，结果误了生产。不少的中农单独组织了互助组（怕贫雇农“占”他们）；这样，连贫雇农的生产也受了影响。农村中在现在还有不少中农不敢说话，不愿说话，怕受排斥。这次中农听到我们宣传政策，说：“这可好了，睡觉也睡得着啦！”
    利益受到侵犯的中农，虽然只是中农的一部分，但能说这样不会影响整个中农阶层，不会损害生产吗？贫雇农看到发展成中农没有好处，谁还愿意勤劳生产呢？如果不能巩固地团结全体中农，怎么能实现全面的增产和实行真正民主的普选呢？经过学习政策和深入检查工作以后，现在兴义县各级干部对这个问题已普遍重视起来，开始结合生产纠正这个偏向，在贷款等方面给中农以应有的支持和照顾，并切实教育贫雇农民主动自觉地团结中农，在政治上不排挤（在普选中特别注意），在经济上不侵犯。一定要用事实使全体农民都相信党和政府的各项政策，使全体农民的生产积极性都能充分地发挥出来。
