    "For a Better Life" is an excellent film from the Romanian People's Republic. This is the first Romanian film shown in our country. From the content of this film, we recognize how important it is to eliminate cosmopolitanism from people's thinking and awareness, and we recognize that in the construction of a new life, we must always be vigilant and not be complacent or relax our vigilance against counter-revolutionaries.

    The film is based on the story of Professor Tang Aorjiang, an outstanding Romanian scientist, conducting an experiment to produce high-quality pig iron. Professor Aorjiang spent more than two years leading this important research work in the Academy of Sciences. The success of this research is of great significance to the industrial development of Romania. He and his comrades were full of enthusiasm and confidence in this work. His comrades said, "With pig iron, we can make steel." They named this pig iron "the gold of the motherland." The work of testing their research results was carried out in the factory. The workers deeply understood the significance of this experiment for the construction of their motherland, and they shortened the preparation time for the experiment with high labor enthusiasm. The film depicts an old worker requesting a piece of pig iron to be made into an engagement ring for his daughter when the experiment is successful. This vividly demonstrates the workers' extreme emphasis on this experiment.

    However, the experiment was not successful; it was sabotaged by spies in secret. This was a heavy blow to Aorjiang. The film depicts Aorjiang losing confidence in his research work after the failure, due to the influence of the Academy of Sciences Dean Mao Ka's ideas.

    Mao Ka is a person whose mind is filled with reactionary cosmopolitan ideas. He regards his motherland as backward and unsuitable for cultivating "true science." He adopts a slavish attitude towards American science. He reveres the American scientist who manufactures murderous weapons—suffocation gas—as an idol. He believes that the path a true scientist should take is to engage in pure theoretical research, and he despises those scientists who put theory into practice for the benefit of the people. He says that kind of work is insignificant, and only pure theoretical research is great. He also holds a mystical and skeptical view of science: "Science is something that makes people doubt." Aorjiang's initial experimental failure made him happy because he believed it proved that his view was correct, and that Aorjiang was on the wrong path. Under the influence of Mao Ka's reactionary ideas, Aorjiang began to doubt his scientific experiment and lost confidence. But Aorjiang and Mao Ka are not the same type of people. Aorjiang is willing to contribute his wisdom to his motherland, and he is willing to find a correct path to create a better new life. These differences between him and Mao Ka are important reasons why he can later break away from the influence of bourgeois ideology in the arduous ideological struggle.

    Through the depiction of Mao Ka, the film powerfully criticizes the idea of harming the interests of the people and worshiping the decadent imperialist science, that is, the idea of not combining scientific theoretical research with practical work. Through the depiction of Aorjiang, the film points out that if a scientist is captured by bourgeois scientific ideas, he will waver in the face of science and lose the courage to move forward, and he will also lack confidence in the creative power of the people. How to eliminate the poison of this reactionary ideology and guide scientists to the correct path undoubtedly requires a ruthless struggle. The film truthfully depicts this struggle. The leaders of the struggle are the representative of the Party, Andrei—the person in charge of the Party group of the Academy of Sciences, Aorjiang's assistant; and Aorjiang's wife, Anka, who is also Aorjiang's assistant, as well as all the people living around Aorjiang who are loyal to their motherland. It was these powerful people who kicked away Mao Ka, the stone hindering scientific progress (removed from office), and pulled Aorjiang out of the quagmire of bourgeois ideology.

    The film's depiction of Andrei's struggle against Mao Ka and Anka's help to Aorjiang vividly demonstrates the Romanian new type of scientists' spirit of persisting in the struggle of science serving the people. After the experiment failed, Mao Ka wanted Aorjiang to give up meaningful practical work and let him study "pure theory." He believed that Aorjiang's experiment was "nonsense." Andrei said, "How can you say his work is nonsense! We are looking forward to great achievements, and you also know the significance of his work for our industrialization." Mao Ka said, "You are wrong, not all theories can serve practical interests." Andrei refuted Mao Ka's absurd argument. He said, "Professor Aorjiang is taking the path of Soviet scientists, and we must help him in this regard." Mao Ka not only did not help Aorjiang, but made him more and more depressed. Andrei and his comrades finally, through the Party organization, suggested that the administrative office remove Mao Ka from his post as Dean of the Academy of Sciences.

    The film does not simply deal with Aorjiang's ideological transformation process, but awakens Aorjiang's sense of responsibility to the people through the advanced figures around Aorjiang, and penetrates into the depths of his thoughts and emotions, showing this awakening. We saw that Aorjiang could not cheer up after the experiment failed. He said to Anka, "Our current environment is really not good, and we will not succeed under our conditions." "Our factory equipment is not good, and our science and technology are too young." "In the future, we must listen to the words of experienced people...I didn't listen to Mao Ka at the beginning, and I failed. Now I know that Mao Ka is right." Anka is a conscious and far-sighted person. She firmly believes that their experiment is scientifically based and will definitely be successful. She was surprised by her husband's discouragement. She said, "I have known you for twenty years, and this is the first time I have heard you say such things." Aorjiang, under Mao Ka's persuasion, wanted to give up his research work and ask for leave to rest. Anka said, "Actually, do you really need to ask for leave to rest? Definitely not. Especially now, you shouldn't rest. If the experiment is successful, this will be a victory for our country's industry." She accused him of not retreating and putting down his weapons. She said, "The enemy is waiting for us to withdraw from the struggle. We must know that our failure is the enemy's victory. The enemy is trying to use your wavering, self-esteem, and individualism." Anka then took their outstanding scientist Babelshi as an example to illustrate that scientific research must have confidence and a sense of responsibility. She said, "When Babelshi was alive, no one recognized him, and no one helped him, but he was always fighting for the progress of science. But you have lost confidence." Andrei found Aorjiang, who was still distressed, and he didn't know where his mistake was. Andrei said, "We have neglected politics. I failed to expose Mao Ka's cosmopolitan influence in time. We didn't believe in our existing technology and didn't believe in the help of the Soviet Union." This is where Aorjiang's mistake lies. This mistake blinded his eyes and made him unable to see the creative power of the people that could move mountains and seas. The comrades in the laboratory were working enthusiastically, the comrades in the factory had been looking forward to him, and the Party was also concerned about him. Andrei said, "You are with us, and we have enough strength to complete this important work." The letters from the comrades in the factory more powerfully encouraged Aorjiang, and Aorjiang woke up from his wrong thinking. When Mao Ka praised a scientist who invented suffocation gas as great, Aorjiang felt very angry: "You think this is the real path that scientists should take, right!" Mao Ka said, "You are a very special person, always wanting to make gold from stones. Didn't you always think my views were correct in the past?" Professor Aorjiang insisted, "But you still don't know a truth, that scientists must have a position," "Science should serve the people." Mao Ka said, "This is all empty talk!" Aorjiang said, "This is the truth!" Through this concrete depiction, the film pointed out the correctness of the path taken by Aorjiang. He quickly achieved success after resuming his experimental work.

    While the film opposes the cosmopolitanism of certain scientific workers, it also exposes the sabotage activities carried out by counter-revolutionaries. In the film, the American spy Muli instructs his pawns to frantically sabotage Professor Aorjiang's experiment, and through the female spy Shanda, who sneaks into the Academy of Sciences, to provoke relationships between comrades and shake Aorjiang's confidence, attempting to disintegrate the organization of scientific experiments from within. If they cannot disintegrate it, they will use sabotage to prevent the experiment from proceeding. Their purpose is to prevent the implementation of new inventions in industry. Therefore, they welcome people like Mao Ka. Because Mao Ka's cosmopolitanism is the enemy's ideological weapon, it can disarm scientists ideologically. When Aorjiang's experiment was sabotaged by special agents, the enemies said that Mao Ka would be the only happy person. From the enemy's view of Mao Ka, it is very clear who Mao Ka's thoughts serve.

    Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, the leader of the Romanian people, said: "Foreign influence finds particularly convenient hiding places in all aspects of thought, literature, art and science. Therefore, continuing the struggle on the ideological front, opposing the influence of American imperialism, and opposing the attitude of worshiping the decadent culture of capitalist countries is a particularly important task for our party." The film "For a Better Life" is in the spirit of this instruction, opposing the idea of worshiping capitalist science, and also criticizing the lack of confidence in building a new life. This film with profound significance has a great educational effect on our audience. (Attached pictures)

    After the experiment to manufacture high-quality pig iron failed, Professor Aorjiang was very discouraged. This is Anka helping him restore confidence.

    Counter-revolutionaries are frantically sabotaging Aorjiang's experiment. This is a scene where people discover counter-revolutionaries putting explosives in the ore.

    反对反动的世界主义科学观的胜利斗争
    ——介绍罗马尼亚影片“为了美好的生活”

    编剧：巴郎基、涅格俩努  导演：涅格俩努    翻译：尹广文
    罗马尼亚人民共和国布加勒斯特电影制片厂出品  中央电影局东北电影制片厂译制
    “为了美好的生活”是罗马尼亚人民共和国的一部优秀影片。这是第一部在我国放映的罗马尼亚影片。我们从这部影片的内容中认识到：肃清世界主义在人们思想意识里的影响是多么重要，认识了在进行新生活的建设时，随时都不能高枕无忧，麻痹大意，对反革命分子放松应有的警惕。
    影片是以罗马尼亚的一位优秀科学家唐·敖尔江教授，进行一种制造质量优良的生铁实验工作的故事为题材的。敖尔江教授花费了两年多的时间，在科学院里领导这一重要的研究工作。这一研究的成功，对罗马尼亚的工业发展，具有重大的意义。他和他的同志们都对这一工作，充满了热情和信心。他的同志们说：“我们有了生铁就能炼钢了。”他们给这种生铁命名为“祖国的黄金”。试验他们研究成果的工作，是在工厂里进行的。工人们深刻地了解这一实验对他们祖国建设的意义，他们以高度的劳动热情，缩短了实验的准备时间。影片描写一位老工人请求在实验成功时，要一块生铁给他的女儿作订婚戒指。这就生动地表现了工人们极端重视这次实验工作的心情。
    但这次实验并没有成功，它被特务暗中破坏了。这给敖尔江一个沉重的打击。影片描写敖尔江在失败后，由于受了科学院院长茅卡的思想影响，就对他的研究工作失去了信心。
    茅卡是个头脑里充满了反动世界主义思想的人。他把他的祖国看成落后的，不适于培养“真正科学”的坏土壤。他对美国的科学采取了奴颜婢膝的态度。美国制造杀人武器——窒息瓦斯——的科学家，被他奉为偶像。他认为一个真正的科学家应走的道路，是从事纯理论研究，他瞧不起那些为了人民的利益，把理论贯彻到实际工作中去的科学家。他说那种工作是渺小的，唯有纯理论研究才是伟大的。他并对科学抱着一种神秘的怀疑论者的观点：“科学就是使人怀疑的东西。”敖尔江初次实验的失败，使他高兴，因为他认为这证明了他的看法是正确的，敖尔江所走的道路是迷途。敖尔江就在茅卡的这种反动思想的影响下，对他的科学实验怀疑起来，并丧失了信心。但敖尔江和茅卡并不是同一类型的人物。敖尔江愿意把他的智慧贡献给他的祖国，为了创造美好的新生活，他愿寻找一条正确的道路。他和茅卡的这些不同，是他以后能够从艰难的思想斗争中，摆脱掉资产阶级思想影响的重要原因。
    影片通过对茅卡这个人物的描写，有力地抨击了危害人民利益，对腐朽的帝国主义科学崇拜的思想，就是科学理论研究不与实际工作相结合的思想。影片通过对敖尔江这个人物的描写，指出了一个科学家，如果为资产阶级的科学思想所俘虏，他便会在科学面前动摇，失掉前进的勇气，对于人民的创造力量，也就缺乏信心。怎样肃清这种反动思想的毒害，把科学家引导到正确的道路上来，这无疑是需要经过一个无情的斗争的。影片真实地描写了这一斗争。斗争的领导者，是党的代表人物安德列——科学院党组的负责人、敖尔江的助手；还有敖尔江的妻子、也是敖尔江的助手安卡，以及所有忠实于他们祖国的，生活在敖尔江周围的人们都参加了斗争。是这些强有力的人们，把茅卡这块阻碍科学进步的石头踢开去（撤职），把陷在资产阶级思想泥坑里的敖尔江拉了出来。
    影片描写安德列对茅卡的斗争和安卡对敖尔江的帮助，很生动地表现了罗马尼亚新型的科学家们，坚持科学服务于人民的斗争精神。实验失败后，茅卡要敖尔江放弃有意义的实际工作，让他去研究“纯理论”。他认为敖尔江的实验是“胡闹”。安德列说：“你怎样能说他的工作是胡闹！我们正期待着伟大的成绩，你也知道他的工作对我们工业化的意义。”茅卡说：“你错了，并不是所有的理论都能为实际利益服务的。”安德列驳斥了茅卡的这种荒谬论调。他说：“敖尔江教授所走的道路，完全是苏联科学家的道路，我们要在这方面帮助他。”茅卡不但没有帮助敖尔江，反而使他越来越消沉。安德列和他的战友们，终于通过党组织，建议行政撤消了茅卡的科学院院长的工作。
    影片对敖尔江的思想转变过程，不是作了简单化的处理，而是通过敖尔江周围的先进人物，去唤醒敖尔江对人民的责任感，并突入到他的思想、情感的深处，把这一觉醒表现了出来。我们看到敖尔江在实验失败后，振作不起精神。他对安卡说：“我们现在的环境实在不好，在我们这样的条件下，是不会成功的。”“我们的工厂设备不好，我们的科学，还有我们的技术都太年青了。”“以后千万要听有经验人的话，……当初我没听茅卡的话，我失败了。我现在才知道茅卡是对的。”安卡是个有觉悟有远见的人，她深信她们的实验是有科学根据的，一定会得到成功。她为丈夫的灰心感到惊异。她说：“我认识你二十年了，我这是头一次听你说这样的话。”敖尔江受了茅卡的劝告，想放弃他的研究工作，请假休息。安卡说：“实际上，你真的需要请假休息吗？决不是的。尤其是现在更不应该休息，要是实验成功，这就是我们国家工业上的胜利。”她指责他不应退却，放下武器。她说：“敌人正等待我们脱离斗争，要知道我们的失败，就是敌人的胜利。敌人在想尽办法利用你的动摇、自尊心和个人主义思想。”安卡又以他们的优秀科学家巴别什为例，说明研究科学要有信心，要有责任感。她说：“巴别什活着的时候没有人承认他，也没有谁帮助他，可是他总是为前进的科学斗争着。而你却失去信心。”安德列找到敖尔江，敖尔江仍在苦恼着，他不知道自己的错误究竟在那里。安德列说：“我们忽视了政治。我没能及时揭发茅卡的世界主义影响。我们没有相信自己现有的技术，不相信苏联的帮助。”这就是敖尔江的错误所在。这种错误蒙蔽了他的眼睛，使他看不见人民的创造力量可以移山倒海。实验室里的同志们在热情地工作着，工厂里的同志们，一直在盼望着他，党也在关怀着他。安德列说：“你和我们在一起，我们有足够力量完成这项具有重大意义的工作。”工厂里同志们的来信，更有力地鼓舞了敖尔江，敖尔江从错误思想中清醒过来。当茅卡又向他赞扬一个发明窒息瓦斯的科学家是伟大的时，敖尔江感到十分愤怒：“你又认为这是科学家应走的真正道路，对不对！”茅卡说：“你这个人真特别，总是想拿石头炼出黄金来，你过去不是一向认为我的观点是正确的吗？”敖尔江教授坚持地说：“可是你还不知道一个真理，就是科学家要有立场”，“科学应该为人民服务”。茅卡说：“这完全是空话！”敖尔江说：“这是真理！”影片通过了这一具体的描写，指出了敖尔江所走道路的正确。他恢复实验工作后，很快获得了成功。
    影片在反对某些科学工作者的世界主义思想的同时，也揭露了反革命分子所进行的破坏活动。在影片中，美国间谍穆里指使他的爪牙们，疯狂地破坏敖尔江教授的实验，并通过潜入到科学院的女特务山达，去挑拨同志间的关系，动摇敖尔江的信心，企图从内部瓦解科学实验的组织，瓦解不了就使用破坏手段，阻止实验进行。他们的目的是想阻挠新发明在工业上的实施。所以，他们对茅卡这样的人是欢迎的。因为茅卡的世界主义，就是敌人的思想武器，它可以从思想上解除科学家的武装。当敖尔江的实验被特务破坏后，敌人们说，茅卡会是唯一高兴的人。从敌人对茅卡的看法中，很清楚地表明了茅卡的思想是为谁服务的了。
    罗马尼亚的人民领袖乔治乌·德治同志说：“外国的影响在思想、文学、艺术和科学各方面找到特别方便的隐避所。因此，在思想战线上继续进行斗争，反对美帝国主义的影响，反对崇拜资本主义国家的腐朽文化的态度，对我们党来说，是一项具有特别重要的任务。”影片“为了美好的生活”，就是在这一指示的精神下，反对了崇拜资本主义科学的思想，并对于建设新生活缺乏信心的思想也进行了批判。这部有深刻意义的影片，对我国的观众是有很大教育作用的。（附图片）
    制造质量优良的生铁实验工作失败后，敖尔江教授很灰心。这是安卡在帮助他恢复信心。
    反革命分子对敖尔江的实验，疯狂地进行破坏。这是人们发现反革命分子在矿石里放炸药的场面。
