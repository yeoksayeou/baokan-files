What Does the Change in Li Wangui's Mutual Aid Team Show?
    -- An Investigation Report on the Current Situation of Li Wangui's Mutual Aid Team in Zizhong County, Sichuan

    The Li Wangui Mutual Aid Team is a team vigorously cultivated by the Zizhong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Sichuan. During this year's spring plowing season, the team experienced a new situation: mutual aid activities were greatly reduced compared to last year, and about half of the team members worked independently during the busiest rice transplanting work. This situation has had a significant impact in Zizhong County. Some cadres believe that Li Wangui's mutual aid team's actions are "degeneration" and "downgrading." Some cadres believe that "the 'banner' of the mutual aid team has ceased activities, and it will be difficult to lead mutual aid teams in the future." Some say that "the work team directly leading Li Wangui's mutual aid team is not good" and advocate replacing the work team, etc.

    What is the actual situation of the changes in Li Wangui's mutual aid team? Are these changes reasonable? This should be carefully analyzed and studied.

    (I) The Current Situation of Li Wangui's Mutual Aid Team

    The changes in Li Wangui's mutual aid team during this year's spring plowing season are specifically reflected in the following aspects: First, last year, more than ten kinds of activities, such as harvesting the spring harvest, planting peanuts, planting corn, transplanting rice, weeding rice, operating waterwheels, and planting sorghum, were all uniformly scheduled for work and collective labor, regardless of size. This year, only a few activities and a few team members' rice transplanting implemented mutual aid, and the work schedule was not as neat and consistent as last year. Second, last year, the team had many activities, such as formulating production plans, challenging and responding to challenges, bank savings, cattle insurance, taking the lead in buying chemical fertilizers, taking the lead in implementing advanced cultivation techniques, hosting visits, receiving interviews, writing letters to leaders, writing articles for newspapers, etc. This year, only production plans were formulated, new-style rice seedling fields were made, and small seedling dense planting was implemented. Third, last year, because there were many activities, meetings were often held, almost every day; this year, meetings were held only one or two evenings in ten days.

    In general, unified and concentrated activities have decreased, and scattered and individual activities of each team member have increased. The main features resulting from this are: First, working hours have increased compared to the past. Last year, all the work was done by the mutual aid team, and the team members had fixed times for starting and ending work. This year, some production activities are done separately, leaving early and returning late, working under the stars and moon. For example, when Li Wangui transplanted rice, the whole family was mobilized, his wife carried, his brother-in-law carried, and his 70-year-old mother also came to help. Second, the arrangement of production and life is more meticulous than in the past. If the team members' farm tools are old, they mostly do not buy new ones first, but repair the old ones and use them again. If sweet potatoes sprout, they eat sweet potatoes first and save the rice for later. Third, they are more cautious in accepting new things.

    Analyzing from the farm work with reduced mutual aid activities, there are several situations: First, some activities should be reduced, such as planting peanuts and corn, which can be done by oneself using the gaps before and after meals, but last year, they were all done with mutual aid, resulting in more harm than good. Second, some activities seem to be beneficial to production, but the team members are not easy to accept. For example, last year, ammonium sulfate was applied, and the team members had no confidence, but the superiors insisted on taking the lead in using 500 jin. As a result, due to lack of technical guidance, the use was improper, causing waste, and everyone suffered losses. Therefore, similar things are done more cautiously this year. Third, some activities should not be reduced, and the reduction has affected spring plowing production. For example, rice transplanting was delayed by seven days compared to last year because there was no mutual aid, and it took more than 30 additional workdays, and the quality was not as good as other teams. For example, pulling barnyard grass and catching insects, farmers in other mutual aid teams can take timely action and do it thoroughly. Li Wangui's mutual aid team was too busy because there was no mutual aid labor, and the result was that they were too busy to handle everything. Especially for some team members who lacked labor, the insects were not caught, and the barnyard grass was not pulled cleanly.

    These situations reflect that there were too many inappropriate "unity" and "concentration" activities last year, which actually hindered production and artificially frustrated the team members' enthusiasm for production. This year, these deviations have been corrected, which is beneficial to production. However, because there are also some activities that should have been mutually aided but were not, there has been an excessive dispersion of activities, which reflects the weaknesses of decentralized management. For example, although the team members worked harder this year than last year, their efficiency was not as high as last year.

    (II) Why Did the Change Occur?

    Since its establishment, if viewed superficially, the output of Li Wangui's mutual aid team is higher than the level of ordinary farmers in the area, but because the investment far exceeds the general level, the actual income is not as good as that of ordinary farmers. For example, the average yield of major spring crops for the whole team last year was 570 jin of yellow rice (paddy rice) per mu, while the average for local independent farmers was more than 520 jin. However, last year, the major spring crops used 3,500 jin more soybean cake and 500 jin of ammonium sulfate than ordinary mutual aid teams, resulting in more harm than good. For example, team member Li Wanjiang's 7.7 dou of land used 230 jin more soybean cake, worth 250,000 yuan, and harvested 7 dou more yellow rice in the fall, worth 110,000 yuan, resulting in a loss of 140,000 yuan. The whole team currently owes more than 4 million yuan in fertilizer alone, all of which was owed last year. On the other hand, since its establishment, the other income of Li Wangui's mutual aid team has also generally decreased. For example, before joining the mutual aid team, Wu Shaoquan went out to help with work (cutting sugarcane) and could earn more than 1 shi of yellow rice in the fall alone. Lin Xiaozhou and others could also earn 3 or 4 shi of yellow rice by weaving straw hats or pressing oil during the slack season. After joining the mutual aid team, because there were many centralized activities, there was no time when there were opportunities to engage in other sideline occupations, and there were no opportunities when there was time. Although the team also engaged in sideline occupations in a unified manner, because the management was not good, it was not as flexible and convenient as before, and the calculation was poor, resulting in very little profit. Because of the large investment and reduced income, and the cost of living in the area is higher than in general areas (the area is an economic crop area), Li Wangui currently owes more than 1 million yuan, and other team members generally owe more than 400,000 yuan each.

    Due to the above reasons and other problems, the team members' enthusiasm for mutual aid was frustrated, and they developed "failure emotions." Last winter and this spring, party and government leaders publicized the policies of leading agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation. The team members learned that "coercive orders and bureaucratic control" were not government policies, so some concerns were relieved, and the opinions hidden in their hearts were openly exposed, naturally forming the current situation.

    (III) What is the Current Central Problem?

    Li Wangui's mutual aid team is the first mutual aid team in Zizhong County that was organized completely voluntarily, but at the beginning of its establishment, the team members' understanding of the mutual aid team was insufficient. After more than a year of practice, the team members have experienced the benefits of being organized through many specific facts, so the team members are willing to help each other. The team members are very sorry for some mutual aid activities that should not have been reduced this year but were. For example, during the rice transplanting period, they were very busy with both harvesting the spring harvest and transplanting rice. At that time, some team members asked for mutual aid in carrying manure, and some asked for mutual aid in transplanting rice. However, because some specific problems were not properly resolved, they did not help each other.

    These specific problems are: First, the evaluation of work and scoring did not distinguish between good and bad technology, which affected the enthusiasm of the cooperative members, resulting in the phenomenon of dawdling. It took Li Wangui 17 workdays to transplant his own rice, but it took 24 workdays when he helped each other. Second, the problem of cattle. The whole team originally had only seven households and had received a cow awarded by the government. Later, it expanded to 16 households and raised funds to buy another cow, but the price of the cow was still borne by the whole team on average, so the original seven households were dissatisfied. At the same time, there was also a lack of a reasonable system for feeding and using the two cows, so there were often disputes. Third, disunity within the team. The original seven households and the later nine households were not in harmony. The former had more land and less labor, and the latter had more labor and less land. In the past, there was more mutual aid in paddy field cultivation, so the original seven households paid more wages, and the later nine households paid more wages, and the original seven households were also dissatisfied. In addition, Li Wangui himself also had some problems in his style of work, which the team members could not stand.

    The reasons for these three problems are: First, the mutual aid foundation is not very solid, and the development is too fast (the later nine households were forced to join). The old team members and the new team members live far and near, and the land conditions are different, and their demands are not easy to be consistent with each other. For example, the whole team has 17 main laborers, because the organization and use of labor and the evaluation of work and scoring are relatively complicated, and it is not easy to do well. Second, many problems have not been resolved in a timely manner, and many reasonable demands raised by the team members cannot be met. For example, during the rice transplanting last year, the team members raised requests for problems such as scoring regardless of technology and only caring about the main labor force and not the auxiliary labor force when organizing the labor force, but they have not been properly resolved for a long time.

    Obviously, these problems need to be solved in order to continue to consolidate mutual aid and cooperation without hindering the enthusiasm of farmers for production.

    (IV) Some Problems Regarding Leadership

    Why were some cadres so flustered when Li Wangui's mutual aid team reduced those activities that should have been reduced, but they turned a blind eye to those specific problems that existed in the mutual aid team that should have been solved and did not solve them all the time?

    Comrade Fan Xihuan, the leader of the work team responsible for cultivating Li Wangui's mutual aid team, answered after careful consideration of this issue: "It is because the cadres are rash and impatient in their leadership ideology and laissez-faire in their specific work." This statement is reasonable.

    Li Wangui's mutual aid team is a team consciously cultivated by the local leading organs, and many things are emphasized to take the lead, but without considering the actual situation and the team members' willingness, the demands put forward are mostly divorced from reality. For example, last year's rice production increase plan was not based on the team's production situation and the team members' willingness, but only for "challenging the entire Southwest and responding to Li Shunda's challenge." For example, the mutual aid team increased from seven households to sixteen households, not because of the production needs of the mutual aid team itself and the team members' demands, but in order to complete last year's rice production increase plan, to solve the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer in the team, another mutual aid team was forced to merge. There are also many activities that the cadres rigidly moved from other places and other teams in order to make the mutual aid team "perfect." When requiring the mutual aid team to accept these activities, the cadres adopted two methods: One is to label. For example, saying "If you don't do it, it's not just a problem for your team, it will affect the whole county, the whole province, and even the whole Southwest," the team members were very scared and had to accept it. The second is material inducement. In the past, there were many activities that the team members were unwilling to accept, but because they could get a lot of material preferential treatment, "there was something to think about," they tried their best to cope with it.

    Last winter and this spring, when correcting the tendency of rash advance, the cadres simply understood the tendency of rash advance as pursuing advanced forms, and believed that there was no problem with Li Wangui's mutual aid team, so they did not rectify it. Later, an anti-commandism campaign was launched in the countryside, and the cadres' leadership of Li Wangui's mutual aid team stopped the practice of "bureaucratic control" and "commanding," and they were no longer "forced" so tightly. In this case, the team members' dissatisfaction with the cadres' excessive "interference" in the past gradually came to light. Team member Chen Qingmeng firmly withdrew from the mutual aid team, and there were more disputes within the team. Faced with this situation, the cadres of the work team did not pursue the root cause, but believed that the team leader and the team members were too selfish and their "enthusiasm" had shrunk. They felt that there was no way to restore Li Wangui's mutual aid team to the "vigorous" state of the past, so they showed discouragement and did not even go to the mutual aid team often.

    Although the specific leadership of Li Wangui's mutual aid team is the work team, the main responsibility lies with the leadership of the county party committee. Because: First, the excessive demands on Li Wangui's mutual aid team came from the leadership above the county party committee. The work of the work team has always been praised, and the county leaders rarely pointed out the main shortcomings in their work in a timely manner. Second, the difficulties encountered by the work team in its work were repeatedly reported to the county party committee for instructions this year, but they did not receive timely help and resolution. The cadres of the work team felt that there was no way, and finally even collectively requested to be transferred.

    From this point of view, the aforementioned views of some cadres that "Li Wangui's mutual aid team has collapsed" and "it will be difficult to lead mutual aid teams in the future" are obviously incorrect. The correct attitude should be to concretely and deeply study the historical development of Li Wangui's mutual aid team, learn beneficial experiences and lessons from it, in order to improve the leadership of Li Wangui's mutual aid team and the current mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    李万贵互助组的变化说明了什么
    ——四川资中县李万贵互助组现状的调查报告
    李万贵互助组是中共四川资中县委大力培养的一个小组。在今年春耕期间，这个组出现了新的情况：互助活动较去年大为减少，最繁忙的插秧工作，约有半数的组员各干各。这一情况在资中县的影响很大。有些干部认为李万贵互助组这样作是“退化”了，“降级”了；有些干部认为“互助组的‘旗帜’都停止了活动，今后的互助组不好领导了”。有的说“直接领导李万贵互助组的工作组不好”，主张撤换工作组等等。
    李万贵互助组变化的情况究竟怎样呢？这些变化是不是合理的呢？这是应该仔细分析研究的。
    （一）李万贵互助组的现状
    今年春耕中李万贵互助组的变化具体表现在以下几方面：一、去年收小春、点花生、种苞谷（玉米）、栽秧、薅秧、车水、种高粱等十多种活动，不论大小都统一排工，集体劳动；今年只有少数活动和少数组员的栽秧实行了互助，而且排工不及去年整齐一致。二、去年小组的活动很多，如订生产计划、挑战应战，银行储蓄、耕牛保险、带头买化学肥料、带头实行先进耕作技术、招待参观、接见访问、给首长写信、给报纸写稿子等等；今年只订了生产计划，做了新式秧田，实行了小秧密植。三、去年因为活动多，常开会，差不多每天都有会；今年十天中只一、两个晚上开了会。
    总的说来是统一的、集中的活动减少了，各个组员分散的，单个的活动增多了，由此产生的主要特点是：一、劳动时间比过去增加了。去年的活路事事都由互助组作，组员们上工收工都有一定时间，今年有些生产活动则是分散作，早出晚归，披星戴月，如李万贵栽秧时全家动员，老婆甩、舅子挑，七十岁的老母亲也来帮助。二、在生产和生活的安排上，比过去精打细算。组员的农具旧了，大都先不买新的，把旧的修理好再用，红薯生了芽，先吃红薯，把米留到以后吃。三、接受新事物更加谨慎。
    从减少了互助活动的农活来分析，有这么几种情况：一、有些活动是应当减少的，如点花生、点苞谷等零碎活路，利用饭前饭后的空隙，自己就可以做好，但去年都一律互助，结果得不偿失。二、有些活动看起来对生产有利，但组员尚不易接受。如去年施用硫酸錏，组员都没有把握，但上级一定要叫带头用五百斤，结果因缺乏技术指导，用的不得当，造成浪费，大家都吃了亏，因而今年类似的事情就做得谨慎了。三、有些活动是不应当减少的，减少的结果影响了春耕生产。如栽秧因为没有互助，全组的秧比去年迟栽七天，多花了三十多个工，质量也不如别的组。又如扯稗子、捉虫，别的互助组的农民都能及时行动，搞得彻底；李万贵互助组因为没有互助劳动，结果忙不过来，顾此失彼，特别是缺乏劳动力的一些组员，虫没有捉，稗子也没有扯干净。
    这些情况反映了：去年不适当的“统一性”、“集中性”的活动太多，实际上妨碍了生产，人为地挫折了组员对生产的积极性，今年纠正了这些偏向，对生产是有利的。但因为也有一些应该互助而未互助的，以致产生了过于分散活动的现象，结果反映了分散经营的弱点，比如今年组员们劳动虽比去年勤快，效率却不如去年高。
    （二）为什么会发生变化
    李万贵互助组自成立迄今，如果从表面上看，产量是高于当地一般农民的水平的，但因为投资远远超过一般水平，因此，实际收入还不如一般农民。如去年大春作物收获量，全组平均每亩是五百七十斤黄谷（稻谷），当地一般单干农民是五百二十多斤。但去年大春作物比一般互助组多用三千五百斤豆饼、五百斤硫酸錏，结果得不偿失。如组员李万江七石七斗田，多下了二百三十斤豆饼，值二十五万元，秋后多打七斗黄谷，值十一万元，计赔本十四万元。全组目前单肥料一项即负债四百多万元，全部是去年欠下的。另一方面，李万贵互助组自成立以来，其他收入也一般地减少了。如未加入互助组前吴少全出去帮活（割甘蔗），光秋天就可赚一石多黄谷，林孝洲等农闲时编草帽或榨油，也能收入三、四石黄谷；加入互助组以后，因为集中性的活动多，有机会从事其他副业时没有空闲，空闲时又没有机会。组内虽也统一搞副业，但因为经营不好，没有原来灵活、方便，计算也差，得利很少。因为投资大、收入减少，而当地生活费用又比一般地区为高（该地是经济作物区），结果截至目前，李万贵已负债一百万元以上，其他组员大都各负债四十多万元。
    由于上述原因及其他问题，组员们的互助积极性受到挫折，产生了“失败情绪”。去冬今春党政领导方面宣传了领导农业生产和合作互助的政策，组员们知道了“强迫命令、包办代替”不是政府的政策，因此有些顾虑解除了，潜伏在心里的意见就公开地暴露出来了，自然而然地形成了现在的局面。
    （三）当前的中心问题是什么
    李万贵互助组是资中县第一个完全自愿地组织起来的互助组，但成立之初，组员们对互助组的认识是不够的。经过一年多来的实践后，组员们通过不少具体事实，多少已体验到组织起来的好处，因此，组员们是愿意互助的。对于今年有些不应当减少而却减少了的互助活动，组员们都十分惋惜。如在栽秧期间，又要收小春，又要栽秧，十分忙碌，当时有的组员要求互助挑粪，有的要求互助栽秧。但由于若干具体问题没有得到正确解决，所以没有互助起来。
    这些具体问题是：一、评工记分不分技术好坏，影响了社员的劳动积极性，于是就产生了磨洋工的现象。李万贵的秧自己栽十七个工就够了，互助时却用了二十四个工。二、耕牛问题。全组原来只有七户，曾得到政府奖给的一条牛；以后扩大成为十六户，又集资买了一条牛，但牛价仍然由全组平均负担，这样原来的七户就不满意；同时两条牛在饲养和使用上也缺乏合理的制度，所以常闹意见。三、组内不团结。原来的七户和后来加入的九户不和，前者田多工少，后者工多田少，过去在水田耕作方面互助较多，因此原七户出的工资多，后九户进的工资多，原七户也不满。另外李万贵本身作风也有些毛病，组员看不惯。
    产生这三个问题的原因：一是因为互助基础还不很巩固，发展太快（后来的九户是强迫加入的），老组员和新组员居住远近、土地条件等不同，互相间的要求很不容易一致。比如全组有十七个主要劳动力，因为劳动力的组织使用，评工记分都比较复杂，不容易搞好。二是许多问题未能适时解决，不能满足组员们提出的许多合理的要求。比如去年栽秧时评分不论技术、组织劳动力时只管主要劳动力，不管辅助劳动力等问题，组员们曾提出要求解决，但长期都未得到适当解决。
    显然的，这些问题都需要加以解决，才能在不妨害农民生产积极性的条件下，继续巩固合作互助。
    （四）关于领导方面的一些问题
    为什么当李万贵互助组减少了那些应当减少的活动时，有些干部表现得张惶失措，可是对于互助组内存在的那些应该解决的具体问题，他们反倒熟视无睹，一直不予解决呢？
    负责培养李万贵互助组的工作组组长范希焕同志，对于这个问题经过深思熟虑以后答道：“是因为干部在领导思想上急躁冒进，具体工作上放任自流。”这个说法是有道理的。
    李万贵互助组是当地领导机关有意识培养的一个小组，许多事情都强调要带头，但又未顾及实际情况和组员的自愿，因此，所提出的要求，大都是脱离实际的。如去年的水稻增产计划，就不是根据组内的生产情况和组员的自愿，而仅仅是为了“向全西南挑战、向李顺达应战”而制订的。又如互助组由七户增加为十六户，并不是因为互助组本身生产的需要和组员的要求，而是为了完成去年水稻增产计划，要解决组内肥田不够的困难，就将另外一个互助组强迫合并起来的。还有许多活动，则是干部为了使互助组“尽善尽美”，而生硬地从外地、外组搬来的。在要求互助组接受这些活动时，干部采用了两种办法：一是扣帽子。如说“你不搞不是你一个组的问题，要影响全县、全省、甚至全西南”，组员都很害怕，只好接受。二是物质引诱。过去有很多活动，组员们虽然不愿意接受，但因为能得到很多物质优待，“有个想头”，也就尽量应付了。
    去冬今春纠正急躁冒进倾向时，干部把急躁冒进单纯理解为追求高级形式，认为李万贵互助组并没有问题，因此没有整理。以后农村中展开了反对命令主义，干部对李万贵互助组的领导，停止了“包办”和“命令”的作法，“逼”得不紧了。在这个情况下，组员们对过去干部“干涉”过多的不满，才逐渐表露出来。组员陈清孟坚决退出了互助组，组内的争论也多起来了。工作组的干部面对着这种情况，不去追求根源，却认为组长和组员们太自私，“劲头”萎缩了，觉得没有办法使李万贵互助组恢复到过去那样“轰轰烈烈”了，因此表现心灰意懒，连互助组里也不经常去了。
    具体领导李万贵互助组的虽是工作组，但主要的责任在于县委的领导。因为：第一、对于李万贵互助组的过高要求，是来自县委以上的领导方面。工作组的工作，过去一直受表扬，县领导干部对于他们工作中的主要缺点，很少及时指出过。第二、工作组在工作中碰到的困难，今年曾迭次向县委请示，也没有得到及时的帮助解决。工作组的干部因为觉着没有办法，最后甚至集体请求调动工作。
    由此看来，前述的有些干部认为“李万贵互助组已经垮了”，“今后互助组不好领导了”等看法，显然是不正确的。正确的态度应当是具体地、深入地研究李万贵互助组的历史发展情况，从中接受有益的经验教训，以改进对李万贵互助组和当前的互助合作运动的领导。
