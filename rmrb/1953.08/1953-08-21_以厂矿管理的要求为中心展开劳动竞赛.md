    Launching Labor Competitions Centered on the Requirements of Factory and Mine Management
    Kunming Municipal Federation of Trade Unions
    In the second quarter of this year, forty-eight grassroots units, over one thousand groups, and thirteen thousand people from state-owned, locally state-owned, joint state-private, and individual private factories and enterprises in Kunming participated in patriotic labor competitions and achieved some results.

    The labor competition in the second quarter generally started with mobilizing the masses to fully discuss work plans and persisted in conducting competitions according to the work plans. This not only made the competition content more specific and ensured the completion of tasks but also promoted improvements in production management and stimulated the increase of labor productivity as a result of adopting certain organizational and technical measures after discussing the work plans. For example, many workshops and groups in the Kunming Electric Factory, Kunming Smelting Plant, and Yunnan Iron Factory have achieved balanced production. The phenomena of being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end, disconnection between upper and lower levels, delayed product delivery, overtime work, and waiting for materials have been greatly reduced. In April, Xie Qinglin's group in Factory 356 only produced 678 small cutting tools for the entire month. After starting the competition, the production increased from 250 pieces to over 400 pieces in a week, reaching a maximum of 813 pieces per week. After discussing the work plan, the Kunming Smelting Plant overcame the phenomenon of being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end. The electrolysis workshop began to achieve balanced production in May and overfulfilled the task. The smelting workshop solved the problem of air leakage in the blower pipe joints, broke through the target, and created a new record of smelting copper in five hours and thirty minutes. After the Yunnan Iron Factory organized production according to the instruction chart in May, the number of product delivery delays for the entire season decreased from 120 times in April to 87 times, and further decreased to 32 times in June. In the process of discussing work plans, various factories organized department cadres and technicians to go deep into workshops and groups, discover and solve problems, and modify and improve quotas based on the original work plans, thereby improving the work of the departments.

    In the competition, great efforts were made to organize learning and promote advanced experiences. The Drilling Machine Repair and Manufacturing Plant successfully experimented with the "rotary milling method," which solved the urgent problem of producing a large number of probe tubes, increasing production efficiency by four to five times. Factory 208 successfully trial-produced high-manganese steel by learning the "Small Bessie Furnace Smelting Method." According to the suggestions of Soviet experts and combined with the actual situation, the second group of the Majiezi Power Plant put forward the slogan "Learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and gradually realize the burning of dry coal," reducing the moisture content in the coal from 18% to no more than 15%, extending the life of the furnace, reducing coal consumption, and saving electricity for the plant. Because engineers of the Yunnan Iron Factory went deep into the workshops and combined with the workers, and promoted advanced experiences in a guided and organized manner according to production needs, the results were relatively significant. For example, the labor model Niu Rusen and the model engineer Li Fatian jointly researched and successfully experimented with the "Kolesov metal cutting method," increasing cutting efficiency by eight times. The thermal friction saw experiment was successful, increasing efficiency by forty times compared to ordinary sawing machines. The factory's promotion team also held on-site demonstrations, convened seminars, and organized employees to visit and discuss, criticizing conservative ideas.

    According to statistics from thirty factories and enterprises, employees put forward more than 2,000 rationalization proposals in the second quarter, and the administration has adopted more than one-third of them. For example, Zhao Xingxi of the Public Transport Company found two tricks, saving the company more than 3,000 kilograms of charcoal and creating the lowest charcoal consumption record for automobiles in the country (0.55 kilograms per kilometer, while the Tianjin Public Transport Company consumes 0.58 kilograms per kilometer). Xie Qinglin, Chen Xiufeng, and other groups in the tool workshop of Factory 356 used their brains and found ways to improve production efficiency by two to five times during the competition.

    The above-mentioned achievements in the labor competition in the second quarter are inseparable from the active leadership of advanced groups and advanced individuals in production. Compared with the first quarter, the number of advanced groups participating in the evaluation in this quarter increased from fifty-one in the first quarter to one hundred and sixty-two, the number of advanced producers (including veteran technicians and engineering technicians) increased from thirty-four to eighty-nine, and the number of advanced workshops and departments was twelve. As a result of the evaluation, ninety-seven groups were rated as advanced groups in the city in the second quarter, seven workshops and departments were rated as advanced, and fifty-two producers were rated as advanced. Most of them emerged in the second quarter.

    There are also many shortcomings in the labor competition in the second quarter. These are reflected in:

    First, the trade union's concept that the purpose of the labor competition must be to complete production tasks and to center on the current management requirements of factories and mines is not clear enough; in addition, trade union cadres do not go deep enough into production and cannot discover the problems and key points in production, resulting in the labor competition being disconnected from the reform of production management. For example, the competition conditions and contents of many groups are not practical, deviate from the current management requirements of factories and mines, and are generalized, or even formulaic. For example, the production of Factory 356 is the trial production and finalization of new products. In the trial production and finalization, the main requirements are to learn and familiarize oneself with the new product information and operation, establish various systems, and prepare for formal production. However, the competition content of some groups cannot well reflect this requirement, and it is still the old set of "completing tasks on time or ahead of schedule, and producing no defective products," etc. Such a competition cannot play a role and cannot get support from all parties. This is the reason why some factories and mines' competitions have collapsed. On the other hand, many rationalization proposals and advanced experiences have emerged, but not many can really solve problems. Instead of focusing on the key issues in production and administrative technical measures to propose topics and launch a rationalization proposal campaign, the promotion of advanced experience remains at the level of experimental performance, which generally has little effect on production; some factories have established promotion teams, but they do not play a role; Generally, factories and mines do not pay attention to summarizing and promoting the advanced experience of their own units. In short, the spontaneity and blindness of the work of promoting advanced experience have not yet been overcome. In particular, the trade union has done a worse job in mobilizing technicians to go deep into workshops and combine with workers to study and solve technical key problems.

    Second, the trade union generally did not carry out in-depth and meticulous organizational work in the competition, and could not come up with methods, and always used the old methods such as challenges, responses, and inserting red flags. By the end of the second quarter of the Red Flag competition, except for some major factories such as Yunnan Iron Factory, Factory 356, Factory 298, Factory 203, Kunming Electric Factory, and Kunming Smelting Plant, which adopted the advanced experience of the Northeast and combined it with the actual situation to adopt a scoring method on a weekly and ten-day basis, and inserted a mobile red flag, generally still remained in the forms of gongs and drums and adding flowers to the red flag. In addition, the rewards were not timely or there were no rewards, and after a long time, the masses were no longer interested.

    The propaganda and mobilization work is still a weak link, and the feedback is generally not timely. Some units do not change the blackboard newspaper for a month. What is particularly serious is the problem that advanced people cannot be consolidated. The trade union did not regularly supervise and inspect advanced groups and advanced producers, and did not promptly summarize their advanced experience and advanced ideas, promote and commend them.

    Phenomena such as absenteeism, non-compliance with operating procedures and work systems still seriously exist in various factories and mines, affecting the completion of tasks. The trade union has not regarded strengthening labor discipline as its regular work.

    Third, the chaotic phenomenon in production management has not been basically overcome, there are no more practical plans and reasonable quotas, the scheduling is not flexible, and the supply is not timely, which also affects the normal development of the labor competition. For example, the production plan of Cui Guangding's group in Factory 203 was changed too many times, and tasks were often added. The materials that the administration promised to deliver on the 12th were not delivered to the group until the 18th, so they had to stop work and wait for materials. In May, Factory 298 worked overtime for more than 9,000 hours, and the administrative cadres also said: "Everyone is responsible for working overtime." Similar situations generally exist. Of course, it would be wrong to emphasize that the competition should not be carried out because production management is backward, or to think that it cannot be carried out.

    Based on the above situation, in organizing competitions in the future, the trade union must implement the principle that the purpose of the labor competition is to ensure the completion of the national plan and to center on the requirements of factory and mine management. We must adhere to discussing work plans and conducting competitions around work plans. To this end, trade union cadres must go deep into production, discover key points, and purposefully organize rationalization proposals and promote advanced experience that is decisive for current production. In particular, we must pay attention to mobilizing engineering and technical personnel to go deep into the workshops, and continuously solve technical key problems, improve technology, and effectively combine labor and technology in response to the requirements of production management. At the same time, we must take strengthening and consolidating labor discipline as the trade union's constant responsibility. And always care about the workers' hardships, improve welfare work, run the canteens and other collective welfare undertakings well, to ensure the smooth progress of the labor competition.

    以厂矿管理的要求为中心展开劳动竞赛
    昆明市总工会
    今年第二季度中，昆明市国营、地方国营、公私合营及个别私营工厂企业，有四十八个基层单位，一千余个小组，一万三千人参加了爱国主义劳动竞赛，并取得了一些成绩。
    第二季度劳动竞赛一般是从发动群众充分讨论作业计划入手，并坚持按作业计划进行竞赛的。这样不但使竞赛内容更加具体，更能保证任务的完成，而且由于在讨论作业计划之后，采取某些组织、技术措施的结果，推动了生产管理上的改善，刺激着劳动生产率的提高。如昆明电工厂、昆明冶炼厂、云南铁工厂的不少车间和小组，已做到了均衡生产。生产上的前松后紧、上下脱节、产品脱期、加班加点、停工待料现象已大为减少。三五六厂谢清林小组四月份全月只生产小刀具六百七十八件，开始竞赛后，一周内由二百五十件提高到四百多件，最高达每周八百一十三件。昆明冶炼厂讨论作业计划后，克服了前松后紧的现象，电解车间五月份已开始做到均衡生产，并超额完成了任务；熔炼车间解决了鼓风管接头漏风问题，突破了指标，创造了五小时三十分熔铜的新纪录。云南铁工厂五月份按指示图表组织生产后，全季产品脱期次数已由四月份
    一百二十次，减少为八十七次，六月份降低到三十二次。各厂在讨论作业计划中，组织科室干部及技术人员深入车间小组，发现和解决问题，并在原有的作业计划基础上，修改和提高了定额，从而改进了科室的工作。
    在竞赛中，大力组织学习和推广了先进经验。钻机修造厂试验“回旋铣切法”成功，解决了生产大量探管的迫切问题，生产效率提高四至五倍。二零八厂学习了“小贝式炉吹炼法”试制高锰钢成功。马街子发电厂第二组根据苏联专家建议，结合实际情况提出“学习苏联先进经验，逐步实现烧干煤”的口号，把煤中水分由百分之十八降低到不超过百分之十五，延长了炉子的寿命，降低了煤耗，节约了厂用电。云南铁工厂由于工程师深入车间与工人结合，根据生产需要，有领导、有组织地推广先进经验，所以成绩较为显著，如该厂劳动模范牛汝森和模范工程师李法天共同研究，试验“科列索夫金属切削法”成功，切削效率提高了八倍。热力磨擦锯试验成功，比普通锯床效率提高四十倍。该厂推广小组并举行了现场表演，召开了座谈会，组织职工参观讨论，批判了保守思想。
    根据三十个工厂企业的统计，在第二季度中，职工共提出二千余件合理化建议，行政上已采纳了三分之一以上。如公共汽车公司赵星洗找到两个窍门，为公司节约了三千余斤木炭，创造了全国汽车耗炭最低纪录（每公里零点五五公斤，天津市公共汽车公司为零点五八公斤）。三五六厂工具车间谢清林、陈秀峰等小组，在竞赛中动脑筋想办法，使生产效率提高二至五倍。
    第二季度的劳动竞赛所以能取得上述成绩，是和生产上的先进小组、先进人物的积极带头分不开的。与第一季度比较，参加本季评判的先进小组由第一季五十一个增加到一百六十二个，先进生产者（包括老技术工人及工程技术人员）由三十四个增至八十九个，先进车间部门十二个。评判结果，评为第二季度全市先进小组的有九十七个，先进车间部门七个，先进生产者五十二人。其中大部分是第二季度新涌现出来的。
    在第二季度劳动竞赛中，也存在很多缺点。这表现在：
    第一、工会对于劳动竞赛必须以完成生产任务为目的、以厂矿当前管理上的要求为中心这个观念不明确；加之工会干部深入生产不够，不能发现生产中的问题和关键，致使劳动竞赛与生产管理上的改革脱节。例如许多小组的竞赛条件内容不切合实际，脱离厂矿当前管理上的要求，一般化，甚至是公式化的。如三五六厂的生产是新品试制定型，在试制定型中，主要的要求是学习和熟悉新品资料与操作，建立各种制度、以及准备正式生产等。但有的小组的竞赛内容并不能很好反映这个要求，而仍是老一套的“按时或提前完成任务，不出废品”等等。这样的竞赛就不能发挥作用，也得不到各方面的支持，有些厂矿竞赛垮了就是这个原因。另方面，合理化建议和先进经验出现得不少，但是真正能解决问题的不多，不是环绕生产中的关键问题和行政上的技术措施提出课题，展开合理化建议运动，以致推广先进经验停留在试验表演上，一般对生产的作用不大；有的厂成立了推广小组，但不起作用；一般厂矿也不注意总结与推广本单位的先进经验。总之，推广先进经验工作的自发性、盲目性还没有能克服。特别是工会在发动技术人员深入车间与工人结合，研究解决技术性的关键问题方面做得更差。
    第二、工会在竞赛中一般地没有认真进行深入细致的组织工作，拿不出办法来，总是挑战应战、插红旗等老一套办法。红旗竞赛到第二季度末期，除有一些主要工厂如云南铁工厂、三五六厂、二九八厂、二零三厂、昆明电工厂、昆明冶炼厂等采取东北先进经验，结合实际情况，按周按旬采用记分办法，插流动红旗外，一般仍停留在敲锣打鼓、红旗上加花等形式上。加之奖励不及时或没有奖励，久而久之，群众也不感兴趣了。
    宣传鼓动工作仍然是薄弱环节，一般反映情况都不及时，有的单位黑板报一个月都不换一次。特别严重的是先进者不能巩固的问题。工会对于先进小组和先进生产者，没有经常督促和检查，没有及时总结他们的先进经验和先进思想，加以推广和表扬。
    各厂矿工人缺勤、不遵守操作规程和工作制度等现象仍严重存在着，影响了任务的完成。工会也没有将加强劳动纪律当作自己经常的工作。
    第三、生产管理上的混乱现象还没有基本克服，没有比较切实的计划和合理的定额，调度不灵活，供应不及时，也影响了劳动竞赛的正常发展。如二零三厂崔光鼎小组，生产计划更动次数太多，而且经常加任务，行政答应十二日交的材料，十八日还没有交到小组，只好停工待料。二九八厂五月份加班九千多小时，行政干部还说：“加了班大家负责。”诸如此类情况普遍地存在。当然，如果强调生产管理落后就不搞竞赛或认为不能搞，那也是错误的。
    根据上述情况，今后工会在组织竞赛中，必须贯彻劳动竞赛以保证完成国家计划为目的、以厂矿管理的要求为中心的原则。必须坚持讨论作业计划和围绕作业计划进行竞赛。为此，工会干部必须深入生产，发现关键，有目的地组织合理化建议和推广对当前生产有决定性的先进经验。特别要注意发动工程技术人员深入车间，针对生产管理上的要求，不断解决技术上的关键问题，提高技术，切实做到劳动与技术相结合。同时，必须将加强与巩固劳动纪律，作为工会经常的责任。并时刻关心工人的生活疾苦，改善福利工作，办好伙食及其他集体福利事业，以保证劳动竞赛的顺利进行。
