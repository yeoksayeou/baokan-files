    Studying Lenin and Stalin's Theory on the New Economic Policy

    The New Economic Policy is a policy of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It was formulated based on the economic characteristics of the transition period from capitalism to socialism, proceeding from the interests of the worker-peasant alliance, and in order to attract and lead the peasants to defeat capitalism and build socialism together with the working class. Lenin and Stalin's theory on the New Economic Policy provides scientific and exhaustive arguments from all aspects regarding the economic characteristics of the transition period from capitalism to socialism, the necessity of implementing the New Economic Policy, the content, tasks, implementation paths and methods of the New Economic Policy, and the international significance of the New Economic Policy, etc. Lenin and Stalin's theory on the New Economic Policy is an important component of Marxism-Leninism, a development and concretization of Lenin and Stalin's theory on the possibility of building socialism in one country, and one of the outstanding contributions to scientific communism. The victorious history of socialist construction in the Soviet Union proves that Lenin and Stalin's theory on the New Economic Policy is completely correct. Therefore, it is very necessary for us to study Lenin and Stalin's theory on the New Economic Policy.
    (II)
    Marx and Engels pointed out in their writings long ago that there must be a transition period from capitalism to socialism. Marx pointed out in "Critique of the Gotha Program": "Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat." However, Marx and Engels did not live to see the era of socialist revolution, and of course, could not elaborate in detail on the economics of the transition period. Lenin and Stalin created a complete theory on the transition period, thoroughly clarified the economic and political characteristics of the transition period, and scientifically pointed out the path of socialist construction.
    What does the transition period mean? Lenin said in "Left-Wing" Childishness and the Petty-Bourgeois Mentality," written in 1918: "Well, what does the word 'transition' mean? Does it mean, economically, that the present system contains elements, parts or fragments of both capitalism and socialism? Everyone will admit that it does." That is to say, the society of the transition period is no longer a capitalist society economically, but it is also not yet a socialist society, but a society in which multiple economic components coexist in a complex manner.
    Then, why does the transition from capitalism to socialism require a special transition period? Lenin and Stalin believed that the socialist mode of production cannot spontaneously arise within the previous society. Only after the working class and the working people seize political power can they begin to establish a socialist economy. However, when the socialist economy is established, it is only one component of the social economy, and other old economic components still exist. It is impossible for it to become the entire economic system of the whole economy immediately after its emergence. As for the small commodity economy that exists in large quantities, it is impossible to expropriate and expel it, but only to organize and transform it. Therefore, in order to overcome multiple economic components, to transform the small commodity economy, and to eliminate private ownership so that socialist public ownership becomes the dominant and only form in the economy, a special transition period is required.
    Lenin first pointed out in "Left-Wing" Childishness and the Petty-Bourgeois Mentality" that there were five economic components in Russia at that time, namely: 1. Patriarchal, that is, peasant economy that is largely primitive; 2. Small commodity production (including most peasants who sell grain); 3. Private capitalism; 4. State capitalism; 5. Socialism. Lenin believed that the intricate existence of such diverse economic components was a characteristic of the Russian economy at that time; and in a small-peasant country, the spontaneous forces of the small commodity economy and the petty bourgeoisie occupied an obvious advantage. However, although the socialist economy was smaller, it could play a leading role. In "Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," written in the autumn of 1919, Lenin further developed the theory on the economic characteristics of the transition period. Lenin pointed out here that in the transition period from capitalism to socialism in all countries, there must be three economic components, namely, the socialist economy, the small commodity economy, and the private capitalist economy; therefore, there must be three classes, namely, the proletariat, the petty bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie.
    From this, Lenin concluded based on the economic characteristics of the transition period that in the transition period, there is a struggle between the old and new economic components, and the most acute class struggle is inevitable. Socialist construction cannot be carried out through peaceful means. Therefore, all countries must solve the problem of "who will defeat whom" in their transition periods.
    At the same time, based on a comprehensive analysis of the transition period, Lenin and Stalin scientifically demonstrated the necessity of class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat during the transition period; and pointed out that the state power led by the working class and the Communist Party plays a decisive role in turning the possibility of socialist victory into reality. Lenin and Stalin's theory that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the most important condition for building socialism is of great historical significance. It has not only been confirmed by the historical experience of the Soviet Union, but has now been proven by the facts of various people's democratic countries.
    (III)
    As early as the spring of 1918, Lenin, who was well-versed in the laws of socio-economic development, correctly estimated the economic characteristics of the transition period in Russia at that time, and formulated the preliminary basis of the New Economic Policy, which was adopted by the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state. However, due to the civil war from 1918 to 1920, the Soviet state was forced to adopt the policy of war communism, which failed to be implemented. It was not until after the end of the civil war, in order to adapt to the needs of peaceful economic construction, that the 10th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), held in March 1921, passed the resolution on the transition from the surplus grain appropriation system to the grain tax and to the implementation of the New Economic Policy. From then on, the Soviet state changed from war communism to the New Economic Policy.
    Then, why did the Soviet state implement the New Economic Policy? Regarding this question, Lenin theoretically demonstrated the necessity of implementing the New Economic Policy from all aspects in famous works such as "On the Tax in Kind" and "On the Food Tax," and clearly stipulated that its basic task was to establish an economic alliance between workers and peasants in building socialism.
    First of all, the Soviet state at that time was in a very difficult situation. The Russia that the Soviet people accepted from the bourgeoisie and landlords was originally an economically backward country. However, such a country went through four years of imperialist war and three years of war against armed intervention, coupled with the poor harvest and livestock deaths in 1920, which brought the Soviet state to the brink of poverty and bankruptcy. In 1920, the total grain output accounted for only about half of the pre-war (1913) output, the output of large-scale industry was almost six times less than before the war, the output of fuel was insufficient, the transportation industry was destroyed, the metallurgical industry was particularly difficult, and even the most necessary daily necessities were extremely scarce in the country. Russia's situation at that time was described by Lenin as "like a man beaten to within an inch of his life," covered in wounds, and only able to walk "with crutches." Under these circumstances, people felt unbearable about the shortage of goods. Not only did the peasants begin to show a sense of dissatisfaction, but also some workers showed dissatisfaction.
    Lenin said in "On the Food Tax": During the period of war communism, in order to defeat the landlords, capitalists, and armed interventionists, "we actually took all the surplus grain from the peasants, and sometimes even more than the surplus, but also a part of the necessary food of the peasants. We took this grain in order to supply the army and support the workers." At that time, the peasants supported the new regime because they had obtained land and protection from the oppression of the landlords from the Soviet regime, and had established a solid military and political alliance with the workers, so the peasants were willing to accept the surplus grain appropriation system. However, once the war ended and the threat of the return of the landlords had passed, the peasants began to express dissatisfaction with the surplus grain appropriation system and demanded the freedom to dispose of their grain and to supply them with a sufficient amount of goods. This is exactly as Lenin pointed out, the entire war communism was in conflict with the interests of the peasants. "Then there was a question before the Party: it was necessary to set a new policy of the Party for all issues of domestic economic life in response to the new environment." (See "A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)")
    Of course, Lenin was very clear about this situation, so he led the Party to formulate a new policy for economic issues.
    Lenin said in "On the Food Tax": "As a result, the political situation formed in the spring of 1921 requires that the most resolute and urgent measures must be taken immediately to improve the living conditions of the peasants and increase their productivity." Why did we first take measures to improve the living conditions of the peasants instead of improving the living conditions of the workers? Lenin instructed: Because improving the living conditions of the workers requires grain and fuel, and increasing the production and collection of grain, and increasing the purchase and transportation of fuel, only by improving the living conditions of the peasants and increasing their productivity. So it should start with the peasants.
    But how can we improve the living conditions of the peasants and increase their productivity? Lenin believed that it is necessary to seriously change the grain policy, that is, replace the surplus grain appropriation system with the grain tax, and transition from the war communism policy to the New Economic Policy. This was the new policy at the time. This shift demonstrates Lenin's policy of brilliance and foresight.
    Implementing the grain tax is the first step in the New Economic Policy. What are the benefits of implementing the grain tax? Because the amount of the grain tax collected is lower than the surplus grain appropriation system, the grain tax amount must be announced before the spring plowing, and the tax payment period is clearly stipulated. All surplus grain exceeding the tax amount is completely left to the peasants to dispose of themselves. The peasants can freely sell this surplus grain in exchange for industrial products. This can stimulate the peasants' interest in hard management, thereby improving labor productivity and rapidly restoring agriculture. Lenin said that adopting this tax system and circulation system as a transitional method, "the main point is to economically encourage, awaken, and promote the small peasants to carry out their production." ("On the Food Tax")
    (IV)
    Of course, the implementation of the New Economic Policy cannot be understood as merely for healing the wounds of war and restoring the national economic life; but more importantly: the basic task of the New Economic Policy is to establish a strong worker-peasant alliance to defeat the capitalist economy and build a socialist economy. Lenin pointed out in the political report of the Central Committee at the 11th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "The basic and decisive (everything else is subordinate) task of the New Economic Policy is to lay the foundation for the combination of the new economy we have begun to build and the peasant economy operated by millions of peasants."
    In many works, Lenin and Stalin demonstrated the entire significance and basic forms of the economic ties between urban and rural areas and the worker-peasant alliance when discussing the politics and economics of the era of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin and Stalin believed that the problem of socialist economic construction is the problem of the organization of the entire national economy, including both urban and rural areas, both industry and agriculture. The combination of these two economies is the foundation of the socialist economy. Without this combination, socialism cannot be realized. This is not only because agriculture provides food, raw materials, and markets for the development of industry, and industry provides peasants with industrial products and machines to transform agriculture, so the combination of industry and agriculture is needed. Moreover, socialism as an economic system cannot be built on two directly opposed and mutually exclusive foundations: on the one hand, socialist large-scale industry in the city, and on the other hand, private small commodity economy in the countryside. That is to say, in order for socialism to win, neither industry nor agriculture can be built on the basis of private ownership, but must be dominated by public ownership. Stalin pointed out in his speech at Sverdlov University in 1925: "The problem of building socialism is the problem of the organization of the entire national economy, that is, the problem of the correct connection between industry and rural economy. … A socialist society is a production and consumption combination formed by workers in industry and rural economy. If the combination of industry does not have close ties with the rural economy that supplies raw materials, food, and consumes industrial products, if industry and rural economy cannot become a unified and complete national economy, then there is no socialism. Therefore, the problem of the relationship between industry and rural economy and the problem of the relationship between the proletariat and the peasants has become a fundamental problem for building a socialist economy."
    However, the worker-peasant alliance at this moment is different from the past. Before the revolution and in the flames of the civil war, the purpose of the worker-peasant alliance was to overthrow the landlords, the bourgeoisie, and defeat the armed interventionists. This alliance was a military and political alliance; but in the period of socialist construction and under the socialist system, this alliance is not only a political alliance, but also an economic alliance, even if the working class and the peasants form an alliance on the basis of consistent class interests. Stalin said in his report "On the Industrialization of the Country and on the Right Deviation in the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" in October 1928: "One cannot think that this union is a spiritual union. Of course, it is clear that the union of the working class and the peasants is a union of calculating. It is a union of the interests of the two classes, the class union of the working class and the basic masses of the peasants, for the purpose of being mutually beneficial to both parties. It is very clear that if we destroy or almost destroy this incentive of the peasant economy, and deprive the peasant economy of its future, then we will have no union, no alliance between the working class and the peasants."
    However, how can we achieve the combination of industry and agriculture and consolidate the economic alliance between workers and peasants? Of course, only by vigorously developing the commodity circulation between urban and rural areas. Lenin and Stalin taught us that in order to establish the economic combination of urban and rural areas, industry and agriculture, it is necessary to maintain commodity production (exchange through buying and selling) for a certain period of time as the only form of economic connection with the city that peasants can accept. Therefore, developing commerce, organizing commodity circulation between urban and rural areas, and at the same time ensuring the state's regulation of the market, are the basic links in the chain of historical events at that time. Lenin pointed out in "The Role of Gold Now and After the Complete Victory of Socialism": "At present, in the activities we are talking about, such a link is to revitalize domestic commerce, and to be correctly regulated (guided) by the state." This is the link that the state and the party "must seize with all their strength." Comrade Stalin also pointed out in "On the Foundations of Leninism": "Because under the conditions of the New Economic Policy, industry and peasant economy can only be combined through commerce; because under the conditions of the New Economic Policy, having production but no sales is fatal to industry; because only by developing commerce to expand sales can industry be expanded; because only after consolidating in commerce, only after grasping commerce, only after grasping this link, can we hope to combine the industrial and agricultural markets and successfully solve the current tasks in order to create conditions for establishing a socialist economic foundation." Therefore, the commercial problem in the Soviet Union's recovery period is essentially the combination problem between socialist industry and the private small peasant economy, that is, the worker-peasant alliance problem.
    However, at that time, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce were very weak, and many Communist Party members had not yet understood the skills of doing business and were not good at fighting against private capitalist entrepreneurs, merchants, and speculators. Therefore, it was necessary to strengthen the work of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce. Lenin taught that Communist Party members must learn to manage the economy and must learn to do business in a civilized manner; if they do not understand business and cannot do business, they should recognize this shortcoming and be determined to "learn from scratch."
    (V)
    Under the conditions that multiple economic components exist in the transition period, especially under the conditions that small commodity production occupies a dominant position, to develop commerce and allow private individuals to trade in the market and private industrialists to open small businesses will inevitably lead to a certain degree of revival and growth of capitalism. According to Lenin's description, small commodity production is generating capitalism every day and every hour. However, Lenin and Stalin believed that the working class, which controls state power and the economic lifeline, is not afraid of this under the conditions of establishing a solid worker-peasant alliance. Because although the New Economic Policy aims to ensure a certain degree of freedom of trade, it opposes complete freedom of trade, and only allows freedom of trade within a certain limit and a certain scope. Commerce, markets, and monetary economy are all carried out under the supervision, adjustment, and guidance of the state, and the phenomenon that the bourgeoisie freely manipulates prices in the market is absolutely not allowed. At the same time, not only speculative merchants, capitalists, and rich peasants are participating in doing business, but also gradually strong state-owned commerce and cooperatives; not only the bourgeoisie is using commerce, but also the socialist economic components that occupy the leading position in the national economy. There is a problem of "who will defeat whom."
    However, allowing a certain degree of freedom of trade is of great benefit to the Soviet state. That is, it can stimulate the peasants' interest in management and make agriculture recover quickly. On this basis, it will restore the national industry and squeeze out private capital; at the same time, when accumulating strength and wealth, it can establish a strong industry and create a socialist economic foundation, and then turn to a resolute offensive in order to eliminate the remaining domestic capitalism.
    Lenin pointed out in "The Role and Tasks of Trade Unions Under the New Economic Policy" when pointing out the necessity of commodity and monetary relations: "The New Economic Policy has not changed the essence of the workers' state, but it has fundamentally changed the methods and forms of socialist construction, because the New Economic Policy allows socialism, which is under construction, and capitalism, which is trying to revive, to carry out economic competition in satisfying the needs of millions of peasants through the market." In order to implement this competition, Lenin proposed at that time that the economic organization and management methods of state-owned enterprises must be changed, that is, state-owned enterprises must implement the economic accounting system.
    When fighting against the Trotskyites, Comrade Stalin developed Lenin's idea of ​​using commerce and currency during the socialist construction period, and pointed out the duality of using commerce and currency. Comrade Stalin believed that although commerce and currency are methods of "capitalist economy," the problem lies in the fact that when socialist components fight against capitalist components, they use this bourgeois method and weapon to overcome capitalist components and build a socialist economic foundation.
    In addition, when starting to implement the New Economic Policy, Lenin also proposed the method of using state capitalism. This is because Lenin considered that under the conditions that small peasant economy exists in large quantities, it allows freedom of trade, and the peasants are very in need of industrial products, while the national industry is not very developed and unable to meet the needs of the peasants, so it is advocated to adopt the method of state capitalism as a tool to connect industry and agriculture and as a means to improve productivity. Lenin's plan was completely correct under the conditions of the socialist industry that was not very developed at that time. Guiding capitalism into the waterway of state capitalism and making it serve socialist construction along a certain track under the leadership of the state is the only correct policy. Because capitalism is still progressive for the small peasant economy, and state capitalism is even more progressive. However, later, socialist industry, state-owned commerce, and cooperative commerce have occupied a dominant force, and the Soviet state has established ties between urban and rural areas with its own strength; at the same time, from 1921 to 1925, the most significant form of state capitalism—concession enterprises and leasing enterprises—has not obtained significant development, then state capitalism can no longer be regarded as the main form in the Soviet state's economy. Comrade Stalin made a precise demonstration on this point in the summary report on the central political work at the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and severely criticized the mistakes of the "opposition."
    (VI)
    Lenin's cooperative plan has great significance under the New Economic Policy. Because various forms of cooperatives, under the conditions that the New Economic Policy allows the development of commerce, markets, and commodities and monetary relations, it is not only an extremely important means to fight against capitalist components, but also can absorb peasants to participate in socialist construction and gradually turn the small peasant economy to the socialist road. Lenin wrote in "On Cooperation": "Now, that is, since the October Revolution, regardless of how the New Economic Policy is (in this regard, it should be said, precisely because of the New Economic Policy), our cooperative system has a very important significance, and it is unlikely that everyone understands this. … To be honest, under the New Economic Policy, fully and widely cooperating the residents of Russia to a full and deep extent is all we need, because we have now found the standard that combines private interests, private business interests, and the interests of state inspection and supervision, even if private interests are subordinate to the interests of the whole, and this was an unsolvable problem for many, many socialists before."
    Marx and Engels pointed out in their works that in a peasant country, the proletarian revolution must win the assistance of the peasants in order to win victory; and Engels also taught in "The Peasant Question in France and Germany": "When we have seized state power, we cannot imagine using violence to expropriate the small peasants (whether or not there is compensation is irrelevant) …." Lenin continued to develop this brilliant idea. The great significance of Lenin's "On Cooperation" lies in the fact that for the first time in the history of Marxism, it theoretically clarified the path of the small peasant economy to the socialist track, and formulated the program of the basic method of peasant cooperativization to go to socialism. Comrade Stalin profoundly explained the content of Lenin's cooperative plan in "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" and "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and emphasized its world-historical significance for building a socialist society.
    Lenin's cooperative plan includes various cooperatives, from simple supply and marketing cooperatives to the highest-level production cooperatives, all of which should be gradually developed. Lenin believed that cooperatives are something that millions of peasants can easily accept and understand; through cooperatives, especially agricultural cooperatives, peasants can be absorbed to participate in socialist construction, which is the only way to transition from small peasant production to collective farms. "Lenin pointed out that under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the worker-peasant alliance, under the condition of ensuring the proletariat's leadership over the peasants, and under the condition of the existence of socialist industry, a production cooperative system that is organized correctly and includes millions of peasant masses is the means that can be used to build a complete socialist society in our country." ("A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)")
    Lenin taught us that in leading the cause of peasant cooperatives, we must not adopt crude and coercive methods towards the peasants. Lenin said in "Speech at the First All-Russian Congress of Agricultural Communes and Agricultural Labor Associations": "Our country has millions of individual farmers scattered in remote rural areas. To try to transform them with some rapid method, some order from the outside, from the side, is a completely absurd idea." For this reason, we must adhere to the principle of voluntariness, oppose any coercive orders, and must use the method of persuasion and education, and use our own practical achievements to influence them. Of course, it is also wrong to take a laissez-faire attitude.
    Lenin's cooperative plan was personally led and completed by Comrade Stalin. In his writings on the peasant land issue, Comrade Stalin summarized the valuable experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, further developed Lenin's cooperative plan, and formulated and implemented the theory of agricultural collectivization. Comrade Stalin comprehensively demonstrated all the fundamental problems of the socialist transformation of agriculture, such as the conditions and prerequisites for implementing collectivization, the collective farm form of the socialist economy in rural areas, the agricultural cooperative is the only correct form at the current stage of the collective farm, the elimination of the rich peasant class on the basis of complete collectivization, the role of agricultural machinery in the development of the collective farm system, and the consolidation of the collective farm from the organization and economy. In particular, in "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," he further revealed the development laws of collective farms in the period of gradual transition from socialism to communism, and explained the problem of eliminating the essential differences between industry and agriculture.
    (VII)
    In the implementation of the New Economic Policy, it encountered resolute resistance from opposition factions such as Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin. They fundamentally did not understand the essence of the New Economic Policy, and believed that the New Economic Policy was only a retreat and a return to capitalism. This is an extremely absurd distortion. Regarding the essence of the New Economic Policy, Lenin and Stalin have thoroughly explained it in many works.
    When explaining the nature of this retreat taken in implementing the New Economic Policy, Lenin pointed out that war communism was an attempt to attack the capitalist components in urban and rural areas with shock tactics and frontal attack tactics. However, when implementing this offensive, the Party ran too far forward and was in danger of being detached from its base. Therefore, it is necessary to retreat a little, temporarily retreat to a place closer to its rear, and change from shock tactics to the method of surrounding the enemy's fortress, in order to accumulate strength and then start the offensive. Lenin gave a most resolute rebuff to the most harmful distortions of the New Economic Policy by Trotsky and other opposition factions.
    In defeating the absurd remarks of the opposition factions that distorted the New Economic Policy, Comrade Stalin profoundly expounded the essence of the New Economic Policy. Comrade Stalin gave a classic definition of the essence of the New Economic Policy at the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "The New Economic Policy is a special policy adopted by the proletarian state. It anticipates the existence of capitalism under the conditions that all economic lifelines are controlled by the proletarian state. It anticipates the struggle between capitalist components and socialist components, and it anticipates ensuring the continuous growth of the role of socialist components and the continuous weakening of capitalist components. It anticipates the victory of socialist components over capitalist components, and it anticipates the elimination of classes and the building of the foundation of the socialist economy."
    From the instructions of Lenin and Stalin, we can clearly understand that the New Economic Policy only started with a retreat, but it intends to implement the redistribution of forces and launch an offensive in the process of retreat; the implementation of the New Economic Policy is not a one-sided process of capitalist recovery, but a two-sided process of capitalist development and socialist development, a contradictory process of a life-and-death struggle between socialist components and capitalist components according to the principle of "who will defeat whom"; in this process of struggle, socialist components defeat capitalist components, thereby achieving the goal of eliminating classes and building a socialist economy.
    In fact, it is also true that only one year after the implementation of the New Economic Policy, the agriculture of the Soviet state quickly developed, industry and transportation achieved preliminary success, the worker-peasant alliance was greatly consolidated on a new basis, and the proletariat was stronger and more powerful … Therefore, Lenin declared at the 11th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) based on the summary of the first year of the implementation of the New Economic Policy: This retreat has ended, and put forward the slogan of redistributing forces "to prepare for an offensive against the capital of the private economy." In the process of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, the solution to the problem of "who will defeat whom" was solved in industry in the first few years of the implementation of the New Economic Policy; in commerce, this problem was solved in 1927; in agriculture, from 1930, it moved from the policy of restricting the rich peasants to the policy of eliminating the rich peasants, to realize the complete collectivization of agriculture. Stalin pointed out in "A Short History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)": "The purpose of the New Economic Policy is to achieve the complete victory of the socialist economic form. And this goal was achieved by the time of the 17th Party Congress." (The 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was convened in January 1934) "By 1936, the Soviet economy had completely changed. By this time, all capitalist components had been eliminated, and the socialist system had won victory in all sectors of the national economy. … The phenomenon of man exploiting man has been permanently eradicated. Public socialist ownership of the means of production has been laid as the unshakable foundation of the new socialist system in all sectors of the national economy."
    The glorious history of socialist construction in the Soviet Union fully proves the correctness of Lenin and Stalin's theory on the New Economic Policy, and at the same time ruthlessly shattered all the absurd distortions of the New Economic Policy by "left" and right opportunists.
    (VIII)
    Lenin and Stalin's theory on the New Economic Policy has great international significance. It has not only been proven to be completely correct by the practice of building socialism in the Soviet Union, but when countries around the world enter the transition period, they must also follow this path to build socialism. Lenin pointed this out in his report to the Ninth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in December 1921. Stalin also pointed this out when discussing the program of the Communist International in July 1928. Comrade Stalin said: "Can capitalist countries, even the most developed ones, do without the New Economic Policy when transitioning from capitalism to socialism? I think it is impossible. For any capitalist country, the New Economic Policy and its connection with the market to a certain extent, as well as the use of these market connections, are absolutely necessary during the dictatorship of the proletariat." Comrade Stalin pointed out in "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" after he gave a concise summary of Lenin's works on "On the Food Tax" and "On Cooperation": "There is no doubt that for all capitalist countries with a considerable number of small and medium-sized producers, this path of development is the only possible and appropriate path for socialism to win victory." That is to say, any country must have a transition period, long or short, after the victory of the socialist revolution. And in the transition period, the basic principles of the New Economic Policy formulated by Lenin and Stalin should be adopted in the policy towards small and medium-sized producers and towards capitalist components. Therefore, Communists in all countries must study Lenin and Stalin's theory on the New Economic Policy.
    Studying Lenin and Stalin's theory on the New Economic Policy is of more direct and practical significance to us. Because our great motherland is gradually transitioning to socialism, and has now started to implement the long-term construction plan of national industrialization. Although our current situation is somewhat different from the situation in the Soviet Union from 1921 to the socialist construction period, for example, China started the transition to a socialist society from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society after the New Democratic Revolution destroyed the old society, etc.; but it is undeniable that our current situation is roughly the same as the situation in the early stage of construction in the Soviet Union. For example, there are multiple economic components, the small peasant economy occupies a dominant position, and the socialist economy plays a leading role, etc. Therefore, Lenin and Stalin's theory on building socialism is also what we must follow. The path taken by the Soviet Union is basically the path we want to take. The basic problems that the Soviet Union encountered and solved at that time are exactly the problems we are encountering and want to solve.
    For example, Lenin and Stalin taught us that strengthening the economic combination of urban and rural areas and consolidating the worker-peasant economic alliance is the fundamental problem of building socialism. We have also encountered this problem. In order to correctly solve this problem, we also need to follow Lenin and Stalin's instructions: it is necessary to maintain commodity production (exchange through buying and selling) for a certain period of time as the only form of economic connection with the city that peasants can accept. For this reason, we must expand commodity circulation and develop commerce to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and stimulate the development of agriculture and improve the living standards of peasants. In developing commerce, we must especially develop state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, and gradually strengthen the positions of the socialist economy and the semi-socialist economy in commerce, but at a certain period we must never ignore the enthusiasm of private commerce that is conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood. At the same time, under the conditions that private capitalist economy and a large number of small commodity economies exist in our country, the state must use the law of value, adopt correct price policies, supervise, lead, and impose necessary restrictions on the market, do a good job in stabilizing prices and adjusting supply and demand, and effectively prevent and combat the illegal activities of speculative merchants; and gradually and appropriately narrow the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products in order to stimulate the production enthusiasm of peasants and enable industrial products to obtain a broad sales market. In this way, we can strengthen the economic combination between urban and rural areas and further consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants, and we can accelerate the economic construction cause with national industrialization as the basic task. It can be seen that in the process of building socialism, commercial work is very important and very glorious. We should learn commercial work and be good at mastering and leading the market to help the development of industrial and agricultural production. Any view that neglects and belittles commercial work is wrong.
    For another example, Lenin and Stalin taught us that attracting peasants to participate in socialist construction and implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture, the cooperative is the only correct way. We have also encountered this problem and must solve this problem according to the teachings of Lenin and Stalin. Our Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have long instructed us that we must advocate "organizing" and must gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture through the path of mutual assistance and cooperation. The mutual assistance and cooperation movement is precisely the main bridge leading the peasants to socialism; at the same time, it is also necessary for the current development of agricultural production and increasing grain production. The resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on mutual assistance and cooperation in agricultural production said: "The Party Central Committee has always believed that in order to overcome the difficulties faced by many peasants in decentralized management, to enable the vast number of poor peasants to rapidly increase production and move towards the road of abundance, to enable the country to obtain much more commodity grain and other industrial raw materials than it does now, and also to increase the purchasing power of the peasants and enable the country's industrial products to obtain a vast sales market, it is necessary to advocate 'organizing' and develop the enthusiasm of peasants for mutual assistance and cooperation in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. This mutual assistance and cooperation is now a collective labor based on the individual economy (based on the peasants' private property), and its development prospect is agricultural collectivization or socialization." Long-term experience has proven that this policy of the Party Central Committee is completely correct. Therefore, our task is, on the one hand, to strive to realize national industrialization and prepare conditions for thoroughly transforming agriculture; on the other hand, to actively promote the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, patiently educate the peasants to take the socialist road of organizing and making everyone rich, rather than taking the old capitalist road that makes most peasants poor. At the same time, when promoting the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, we must proceed from reality, adhere to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, actively lead, gradually transition from low-level forms to high-level forms, and advance steadily, opposing the tendency of impatience and rashness and the practice of coercive orders, according to objective conditions and subjective forces, and according to the needs and awareness of the peasants. Of course, it is also wrong to take a passive laissez-faire attitude.
    In addition, on the grain tax and the development of peasant production issues, on the attitude towards private capitalism and the use of state capitalism issues, on the development of large-scale industry to transform the entire national economy issues, etc., in Lenin and Stalin's theory on the New Economic Policy, they have given us great inspiration. It can not only help us deeply understand the content of our Party's current economic policy, but also can help us understand the theoretical basis for formulating this policy.
    The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have taught us in many documents that we should study Lenin and Stalin's works well, learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience, and be good at applying this construction experience to our own specific conditions. In the instruction on the theoretical education of cadres in 1953-1954 issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in April this year, it is stipulated that the high and intermediate-level groups of theoretical learning of cadres throughout

    学习列宁斯大林关于新经济政策的理论
    沙英
    （一）
    新经济政策是无产阶级专政的政策，它是考虑到从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的经济特点，从工农联盟的利益出发，为了吸引和领导农民与工人阶级一道来战胜资本主义和建成社会主义而制定的基本政策。列宁、斯大林关于新经济政策的理论，对于从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的经济特点，对于实施新经济政策的必要性，对于新经济政策的内容、任务、实行的道路和方法，以及关于新经济政策的国际意义等等，都从各方面作了科学地、详尽无遗地论证。列宁、斯大林关于新经济政策的理论，是马克思列宁主义重要的组成部分，是列宁斯大林关于在一个国家内可能建成社会主义的理论的发展和具体化，是对于科学共产主义的卓越的贡献之一。苏联社会主义建设胜利的历史，证明了列宁、斯大林关于新经济政策的理论是完全正确的。因此，我们学习列宁、斯大林关于新经济政策的理论是十分必要的。
    （二）
    从资本主义到社会主义必须有一个过渡时期，这在马克思和恩格斯的著作中早就指出过。马克思在
    “哥达纲领批判”中曾这样指出：“在资本主义社会和社会主义社会之间有着一个前者转入后者之革命的转变时期。与这个时期相适应的也有一个政治上的过渡时期，这个时期底国家除了无产阶级底革命的专政以外，不能是别的任何东西。”但是马克思和恩格斯没有活到社会主义革命时代，当然不能对于过渡时期的经济予以详细论述。列宁和斯大林创立了关于过渡时期的完整理论，详尽地阐明了过渡时期经济和政治的特点，并科学地指出了社会主义建设的道路。
    过渡时期是什么意思呢？列宁在一九一八年所写的“论‘左倾’幼稚性和小资产阶级性”一书中这样说道：“那末，‘过渡’这字眼又是什么意思呢？它在经济上是不是说，在这制度中既有资本主义的，也有社会主义的成分、部分或因素呢？谁都承认，是这样的。”这就是说，过渡时期的社会，在经济上已不是资本主义的社会，但也还不是社会主义的社会，而是多种经济成分错综存在着的社会。
    那末，从资本主义到社会主义为什么需要一个特殊的过渡时期呢？列宁、斯大林认为：社会主义的生产方式不可能在以前的社会内部自发地产生，只有工人阶级和劳动人民夺取政权后，才能开始建立社会主义的经济；而当社会主义经济建立时，只是社会经济中的一种成分，其他尚有别种旧的经济成分存在，它还不可能在产生后就成为全部经济的整个的经济体制。至于大量存在着的小商品经济，那是不可能加以剥夺和驱逐的，只能给以组织和改造。因此，为了克服多种经济成分，为了改造小商品经济，为了消灭私有制而使社会主义公有制成为经济中统治的和唯一的形式，这就需要有特殊的过渡时期。
    列宁在“论‘左倾’幼稚性和小资产阶级性”一文中初次指出当时俄国存在着五种经济成分，即
    一、宗法式的，即颇大程度上是原始式的农民经济；二、小商品生产（其中包括大多数出卖粮食的农民）；三、私人资本主义；四、国家资本主义；五、社会主义。列宁认为，如此形形色色的经济成分错综地存在，是当时俄国经济的特点；而在一个小农国家中，小商品经济，小资产阶级的自发势力占着显然的优势。不过社会主义经济虽然较少，但却能起领导作用。列宁在一九一九年秋所写的“论无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治”一文中，进一步发展了关于过渡时期的经济特点的理论。列宁在这里指出了一切国家在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期中，都必然有三种经济成分，即社会主义经济，小商品经济和私人资本主义经济；因此，便必然存在着三个阶级，即无产阶级，小资产阶级，资产阶级。
    由此，列宁根据过渡时期的经济特点得出结论说，在过渡时期旧的经济成分与新的经济成分之间进行着斗争，最尖锐的阶级斗争是不可避免的，社会主义建设不可能以和平的途径来进行。因此，一切国家在其过渡时期中都要解决“谁战胜谁”的问题。
    同时列宁、斯大林依据对过渡时期全面的分析，科学地论证了过渡时期中的阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的必要性；指出了工人阶级和共产党领导的国家政权，在将社会主义胜利的可能变为现实中，起着决定性的作用。列宁、斯大林关于无产阶级专政是建设社会主义最重要的条件的理论，是有巨大的历史意义的。它不仅已为苏联的历史经验所证实，而且现在已为各人民民主国家的事实所证明。
    （三）
    远在一九一八年春季，精通社会经济发展规律的列宁，就正确地估计了当时俄国过渡时期经济的特点，制定了新经济政策的初步基础，由布尔什维克党及苏维埃国家予以通过。可是由于一九一八至一九二○年的内战，苏维埃国家被迫采取了战时共产主义政策，这一政策未能实行。直到内战胜利结束后，为了适应和平经济建设的需要，在一九二一年三月召开的联共（布）第十次代表大会上，才通过了从余粮收集制过渡到粮食税、过渡到施行新经济政策的决议。从此，苏维埃国家由战时共产主义转变到新经济政策。
    那末苏维埃国家为什么要实行新经济政策呢？对于这个问题，列宁在“论物品税”“论粮食税”等有名的著作中，都在理论上从各方面论证了实行新经济政策的必要，并明确地规定了它的基本任务是：必须建立工农在建设社会主义中的经济联盟。
    首先，当时苏维埃国家是处于这样一种非常困难的情况。苏维埃人民从资产阶级、地主手里所接受过来的俄罗斯，原是一个经济落后的国家。可是这样一个国家又经过四年帝国主义战争和三年反武装干涉的战争，加以一九二○年的歉收和牲畜死亡，遂使苏维埃国家濒于赤贫破产的境地。一九二○年粮食出产总量只占战前（一九一三年）出产总量的一半左右，大工业出产量几乎少于战前六倍，燃料出产不够，运输业被破坏了，冶金业尤感困难，国内甚至连最必要的日常用品也都极为欠缺。俄国当时的这种处境，被列宁形容为“如同一个被打得半死的人一样”，遍体鳞伤，只有“借着拐杖”才能走动。在这种情况下，人们对于物品欠缺的情形都感到不堪忍受，不仅农民开始呈现出一种不满情绪，就是在一部分工人中间也表现出了不满情绪。
    列宁在“论粮食税”中说道：在战时共产主义时期，为了战胜地主资本家和武装干涉者，“我们从农民手里实际上拿来了全部的余粮，甚至有时还不仅是余粮，而是农民底一部分必需食粮，我们拿来这些粮食，为的是供给军队、供养工人。”当时农民由于从苏维埃政权取得了土地和免受地主压迫的保障，而拥护新政权，曾同工人建立了巩固的军事政治联盟，所以农民甘愿接受余粮收集制。可是一当战争结束后，地主回归的威胁已成过去的时候，农民便开始对余粮收集制表示不满，而要求自由处理自己的粮食和供给他们充分数量的商品了。这就正如列宁所指出的那样，全部战时共产主义已同农民利益处于相抵触的地位。“于是就有一个问题摆在党面前：必须针对着新的环境来定出党对于国内经济生活一切问题的新方针。”（见“联共（布）党史简明教程”）
    当然，列宁是很清楚这种情况的，于是他就领导着党着手规定了对于经济问题的新方针。
    列宁在“论粮食税”中这样说道：“结果，一九二一年春形成的政治形势，要求必须立刻采取最坚决最紧急的办法，来改善农民生活状况和提高他们的生产力。”为什么首先采取办法改善农民生活状况而不是改进工人生活状况呢？列宁指示道：因为改善工人生活状况就需要有粮食和燃料，而提高粮食的生产和收集，增加燃料的采办和运输，只有改善农民生活状况和提高他们的生产力。所以应当从农民方面开始。
    可是怎样才能改善农民的生活状况和提高他们的生产力呢？列宁认为：就是要严重改变粮食政策，即用粮食税来代替余粮收集制，并从战时共产主义政策过渡到新经济政策。这就是当时的新方针。这
    一转变表现出列宁政策的英明和远见。
    实行粮食税是新经济政策的第一个步骤。实行粮食税有什么好处呢？因为粮食税所征收的数额要比余粮收集制低些，粮食税额必须在春耕以前公布，缴税期限是明确规定了的。所有超过税额的剩余粮食，则完全留归农民自己支配，农民可以自由出卖这种剩余粮食，而换取工业品。这样便可以刺激农民努力经营的兴趣，从而提高劳动生产率，使农业迅速恢复起来。列宁说道：采用这种赋税制度和流通制度作为过渡办法，“主要的一点是在于从经济方面去鼓励、唤醒、并推动小农，使他进行其生产。”（“论粮食税”）
    （四）
    当然，实行新经济政策，不能了解为仅仅只是为了医治战争的创伤和恢复国家经济生活；而更重要的是：新经济政策的基本任务是在于建立坚强的工农联盟，以战胜资本主义经济和建设社会主义经济。列宁在联共（布）第十一次代表大会上中央委员会的政治报告中指出：“新经济政策的基本的和有决定的（其余一切都是从属的）任务，就是奠定我们已开始建设的新经济与千百万农民所经营的农民经济间的结合。”
    列宁、斯大林在许多著作中论证无产阶级专政时代的政治和经济时，指出了城乡经济联系和工农联盟的全部意义与基本形式。列宁、斯大林认为：社会主义经济建设的问题乃是整个国民经济的组织问题，既包括城市也包括农村，既包括工业也包括农业。这两种经济的结合，是社会主义经济的基础。如果没有这种结合，社会主义便不可能实现。这不仅是因为农业给工业的发展提供了粮食、原料和市场，工业给农民提供了工业品和改造农业的机器，所以需要工业和农业的结合。而且作为经济制度的社会主义，不能建立在两个直接对立和互相排斥的基础上：即一方面是城市中的社会主义大工业，而另一方面是乡村中私有的小商品经济。这就是说，为了使社会主义胜利，不论工业与农业，不能建设在私有制的基础上，都必需是公有制占统治地位。斯大林一九二五年在斯维尔德洛夫大学的演讲中如此指出：“建设社会主义的问题，就是整个国民经济的组织问题，也就是工业和农村经济的正确联系问题。……社会主义的社会，是一个由工业及农村经济的工作人员结成的生产消费组合。如果
     工业的组合，与供给原料、粮食及消纳工业品的农村经济不发生密切的联系，如果工业与农村经济不能成为一个统一的整个的国民经济，那就没有什么社会主义了。因此，工业与农村经济的相互关系问题及无产阶级与农民的相互关系问题，就成了一个建设社会主义经济之根本问题。”
    不过，此刻的工农联盟和从前是有所不同的。在革命前和国内战争的火焰中，工农联盟的目的是在于推翻地主、资产阶级和战胜武装干涉者，这种联盟是军事政治联盟；可是在社会主义建设时期和社会主义制度下，这个联盟不仅是政治的联盟，而且是经济的联盟，即使工人阶级和农民在阶级利益一致的基础上结成联盟。斯大林于一九二八年十月在“论国家工业化和论联共（布）党内的右倾”的报告中说道：“不能以为这种联合是精神上的联合。当然明白，工人阶级和农民的联合是打算盘的联合。是两个阶级利益的联合，工人阶级和农民的基本群众之阶级联合，目的是在双方相互有利。很明白的，假使我们毁灭了或者差不多毁灭了这种农民经济的激励作用，剥夺了农民经济的前途，那么我们就没有联合，就没有工人阶级和农民的联盟了。”
    但是，怎样才能达到工业与农业的结合和巩固工农的经济联盟呢？当然只有用极力发展城乡间的商品流转这个方法。列宁、斯大林教导我们说，为了建立城市和乡村、工业和农业的经济结合，要在一定时期内保持商品生产（通过买卖的交换）这个为农民唯一可以接受的与城市进行经济联系的形式。因此，发展商业，组织城乡间的商品流通，同时保证国家对市场的调节，则是当时历史事件链条中的基本环节。列宁在“现时和社会主义完全胜利后金子底作用”一文中这样指出：“目前在我们所说的活动上，这样的环节就是要振兴国内商业，而由国家加以正确的调节（指导）。”这是国家和党“必须用全力抓住的环节”。斯大林同志在“论列宁主义基础”的著作中亦曾指出：“因为在新经济政策条件下，工业和农民经济只有经过商业才可结合起来；因为在新经济政策条件下，有生产而没有销路，便是致工业于死命；因为只有借发展商业去扩展销路，才可扩展工业；因为只有在商业方面巩固以后，只有把握商业以后，只有把握着这个环节以后，才可希望把工业和农业市场结合起来，并顺利解决当前任务，以便造成建立社会主义经济基础的条件。”因此，在苏联恢复时期的商业问题，实质上是社会主义工业与私有的小农经济间的结合问题，也就是工农联盟的问题。
    可是当时国营商业和合作社商业都很薄弱，许多共产党员还没有懂得经商的技能，还不善于同私资企业家、商人和投机者进行斗争，因此这就需要加强国营商业和合作社商业的工作。列宁教导说：共产党员必须学会管理经济，必须学会文明经商；如果不懂业务，不会做买卖，便应当认识这种缺点，而下决心“从头学起”。
    （五）
    在过渡时期存在着多种经济成分的条件下，特别是在小商品生产占优势地位的条件下，要发展商业，并允许私人在市场上进行贸易和私人工业家开设小企业，将势必引起资本主义在一定程度上的复活与滋长。按照列宁的描述，小商品生产每日每时都在产生着资本主义的。但是列宁、斯大林认为，掌握国家政权和经济命脉的工人阶级，在建立了巩固的工农联盟的条件下，对于这点并不可怕。因为新经济政策虽然以保证某种贸易自由为目的，但是反对完全贸易自由，只允许一定限度和一定范围内的贸易自由，商业、市场及货币经济等都是在国家监督、调剂及指导之下进行的，绝不允许资产阶级在市场上自由玩弄价格的现象。同时参加做买卖的，不仅有投机商人、资本家和富农，而且还有逐渐强大的国营商业和合作社；利用商业的不仅有资产阶级，还有居国民经济领导地位的社会主义经济成分。这里存在着“谁战胜谁”的问题。
    可是容许一定的贸易自由，却对苏维埃国家有很大的好处。即它能刺激农民经营的兴趣，使农业迅速恢复起来，在这个基础上，将会使国家工业恢复起来，而把私人资本排挤出去；同时当积蓄了力量和资财以后，就可以建立强大的工业，创立社会主义的经济基础，然后转为坚决的进攻，以便消灭国内资本主义残余。
    列宁在“新经济政策下职工会底作用与任务”一文中指出商品和货币关系的必要性时说道：“新经济政策并没有改变工人国家底实质，但它所根本改变着的是社会主义建设底方法和形式，因为新经济政策，容许正在建设中的社会主义与正在力图复活的资本主义之间，在经过市场来满足千百万农民需要这方面，实行经济竞赛。”为了实行这种竞赛，列宁当时提出必须改变国营企业的经济组织和经营方法，即国营企业必须实行经济核算制。
    斯大林同志同托派作斗争时，发挥了列宁关于在社会主义建设时期利用商业、货币的思想，指出了利用商业、货币的双重性。斯大林同志认为：商业与货币虽是“资本主义经济”的方法，但问题是在于社会主义成分与资本主义成分作斗争时，就利用着这种资产阶级的方法和武器，来克服资本主义的成分和建筑社会主义的经济基础。
    除此以外，列宁在开始实行新经济政策的时候，还提出了利用国家资本主义的办法。这是因为列宁考虑到：在小农经济大量存在的条件下，既允许贸易自由，农民非常需要工业品，而国家工业还不甚发达，无力满足农民的要求，所以主张采取国家资本
    主义的办法，作为联系工业与农业的工具，作为提高生产力的手段。列宁这种策划在当时还没有很发达的社会主义工业的条件下是完全正确的。把资本
    主义引导到国家资本主义的水道中来，使其在国家领导下沿着一定的轨道为社会主义建设服务，这是唯一正确的政策。因为对小农经济来说，资本主义
    还是进步的，而国家资本主义则是更进步的。可是到了后来，社会主义工业、国营商业和合作社商业已占了优势的力量，苏维埃国家已经用自己的力量建立了城乡间的联系；同时从一九二一到一九二五年这一段时期内，国家资本主义最显著的形式——租让企业和租赁企业也没有获得显著的发展，那就不能再把国家资本主义作为苏维埃国家经济中的主要形式来看待了。关于这一点，斯大林同志在联共
    （布）第十四次代表大会上关于中央政治工作的总结报告中曾作了确切的论证，严厉地指责了“反对派”的错误。
    （六）
    列宁的合作社计划，在新经济政策条件下有巨大的意义。因为各种形式的合作社，在新经济政策容许商业、市场及商品、货币关系发展的条件下，它不仅是在同资本主义成分作斗争的极重要的手段，而且还可以吸收农民参加社会主义建设，逐渐把小农经济转到社会主义道路去。列宁在“论合作制”一文中写道：“现在，即自十月革命以来，且不管新经济政策怎样（在这方面，反而应该说，正由于有新经济政策的缘故），我国的合作制有着非常重要的意义，关于这层，未必所有的人都了解。……老实说，在新经济政策下，将俄国居民充分广泛充分深刻地合作化，这就是我们所需要的一切，因为我们现在找着了把私人利益、私人营业利益与由国家检查监督这一利益二者结合起来的标准，即使私人利益服从全体利益的标准，而这点对于以前许多许多社会主义者说来，曾是不可解决的难题。”
    在马克思和恩格斯的著作中曾指出：在农民的国度中无产阶级革命要取得胜利，必须取得农民的援助；而且恩格斯在“德法农民问题”中还教导说：
    “当我们掌握了国家政权的时候，我们根本不能设想用暴力去剥夺小农（有无赔偿是无关重要的）……。”列宁继续发展了这种光辉的思想。列宁的“论合作制”这篇论文的巨大意义，就是在于在马克思主义的历史上头一次从理论上阐明了小农经济转上社会主义轨道的途径，拟定了农民合作化这一走向社会主义的基本方法的纲领。斯大林同志在“联共
    （布）党史简明教程”中，在“苏联社会主义经济问题”中，都极为深刻地阐明列宁合作社计划的内容，并强调指出了它对建成社会主义社会的世界历史意义。
    列宁的合作社计划包括各种合作社，从简单的供销合作社起，到最高级的生产合作社止，都应当逐渐发展起来。列宁认为，合作社是千百万农民易于接受和了解的东西；经过合作社特别是农业合作社，可以吸收农民参加社会主义建设，这是从小农生产过渡到集体农庄的唯一道路。“列宁指出，在无产阶级专政和工农联盟的条件下，在保证无产阶级对农民实行领导的条件下，在有社会主义工业存在的条件下，组织得正确而包括有千百万农民群众的生产合作制，就是可能用以在我国建成完备社会主义社会的手段。”（“联共（布）党史简明教程”）
    列宁教导我们说，领导农民合作社的事业，对农民不能采用粗暴的强制的方法。列宁在“在农业公社和农业劳动组合第一次代表大会上的演说”中说道：“我国有千百万分散于穷乡僻壤的个体农户。要想用某种急速的办法，某种命令从外面、从旁边去强迫加以改造，那就是完全荒谬的思想。”为此，必须坚持自愿原则，反对任何的强迫命令手段，一定要用说服教育的方法，用自己的实际成绩来影响他们。当然，采取放任自流的态度也是错误的。
    列宁的合作制计划，是斯大林同志亲手领导完成的。斯大林同志在关于农民土地问题的著作中，总结了苏联社会主义建设的宝贵经验，进一步发展了列宁的合作社计划，制定了并实现了农业集体化的理论。斯大林同志对于农业进行社会主义改造的一切根本问题，例如关于实行集体化的条件和前提、关于农村中社会主义经济的集体农庄形式、关于农业组合是集体农庄现阶段的唯一正确的形式、关于在全盘集体化的基础上消灭富农阶级、关于农业机器站在集体农庄制度发展中的作用、关于从组织上经济上巩固集体农庄等问题，都作了完备的论证。特别是他在“苏联社会主义经济问题”中进一步揭示了集体农庄在由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义时期中的发展规律，阐明了关于消灭工业与农业间的本质差别问题。
    （七）
    在新经济政策的施行中，遇到了托洛茨基、季诺维也夫、加米涅夫和布哈林等反对派分子的坚决反抗。他们根本不了解新经济政策的实质，认为新经济政策只是一种退却，是回复到资本主义。这是一种荒谬绝顶的歪曲。关于新经济政策的实质，列宁和斯大林在许多著作中都加以详尽地阐明了。
    列宁在阐明施行新经济政策所采取的这种退却的性质时指出：战时共产主义是用冲击手段，用正面进攻手段攻击城乡资本主义成分的尝试。可是在实行这种进攻时，党向前面跑得太远了，有脱离自己根据地的危险。所以需要稍许后退一点，暂时退到更接近自己后方的地方去，由冲击手段转为包围敌人堡垒的方法，以便积蓄起力量后，再去开始进攻。列宁对托洛茨基以及其他反对派分子对新经济政策的最有害的歪曲，给予了一个最坚决的回击。
    在战胜反对派分子歪曲新经济政策的荒谬言论中，斯大林同志深刻地阐述了新经济政策的实质。斯大林同志在联共（布）第十四次代表大会上曾对新经济政策的实质下了一个经典的定义：“新经济政策是无产阶级国家所采取的一种特殊政策，它预计到在一切经济命脉操在无产阶级国家手中的条件下容许资本主义存在，它预计到资本主义成分和社会主义成分间的斗争，预计到保证社会主义成分底作用不断增长而资本主义成分不断削弱下去，预计到社会主义成分战胜资本主义成分，预计到消灭阶级和建成社会主义经济底基础。”
    从列宁、斯大林的指示中，我们可以清楚地了解：新经济政策只是以退却而开始，但它是打算在退却过程中实行重新配置力量并举行进攻的；实行新经济政策并不是单方面资本主义恢复的过程，而是双方面的资本主义发展和社会主义发展的过程，是社会主义成分与资本主义成分按照“谁战胜谁”的原则进行殊死斗争的矛盾过程；在这种斗争的过程中，社会主义成分战胜资本主义成分，从而达到消灭阶级和建成社会主义经济的目的。
    在事实上也是这样的，即当新经济政策施行才不过一年之后，苏维埃国家的农业很快发展了，工业和运输业达到了初步的成功，工农联盟在新的基础上大加巩固，无产阶级已更加坚强有力……因此，列宁就根据新经济政策施行第一年的总结而在联共
    （布）第十一次代表大会上声言：这种退却已经终结，并提出口号要重新配置力量“准备向私人经济的资本实行进攻。”在苏联社会主义建设的过程中，“谁战胜谁”这个问题的解决，在工业中，当实行新经济政策最初的几年中即已解决；在商业中，这个问题是一九二七年解决的；在农业中，从
    一九三○年起，就从限制富农的政策进到消灭富农的政策，来实现农业的全盘集体化。斯大林在“联共（布）党史简明教程”中指出：“新经济政策底目的是要社会主义经济形式获得完全胜利。而这个目的到第十七次党代表大会的时候已经实现了。”（联共（布）第十七次代表大会是一九三四年一月召集的）“到一九三六年时，苏联经济已经完全改变。到这时候，资本主义成分已全被消灭，而社会主义体系则已在国民经济一切部门中获得胜利。……人剥削人的现象已永远铲除。公共的社会主义生产资料所有制，在国民经济一切部门中都已奠定为社会主义新制度不可动摇的基础。”
    苏联社会主义建设的光辉的历史，完全证明了列宁、斯大林关于新经济政策的理论的正确性，同时也无情地粉碎了一切“左”右倾机会主义分子对于新经济政策的荒谬的歪曲。
    （八）
    列宁、斯大林关于新经济政策的理论是有伟大的国际意义的。它不仅已为苏联建设社会主义的实践证明了是完全正确的，而且当世界各国走进过渡时期时，也都必须遵循这条道路来建设社会主义。对此，列宁在一九二一年十二月的第九次全俄苏维埃代表大会的报告中指出过。斯大林在一九二八年七月讨论共产国际的纲领时也指出过，斯大林同志说道：“资本主义各国，其中甚至于最发达的国家，当自资本主义过渡到社会主义时，能否不用新经济政策呢？我想是不可能的。对任何资本主义国家来说，在某种程度上的新经济政策与其市场的联系，以及对这些市场联系的利用，在无产阶级专政时期是绝对必要的。”斯大林同志在“苏联社会主义经济问题”中当他对列宁关于“论粮食税”的一些著作以及“论合作制”等作了简明的概括之后，又这样指出：“不容置疑，对于一切具有人数相当众多的中小生产者阶级的资本主义国家，这条发展道路是使社会主义获得胜利的唯一可能的和适当的道路。”这就是说，任何国家在社会主义革命胜利后，都要有一个或长或短的过渡时期。而在过渡时期中，在对待中小生产者和对待资本主义成分的政策上，都要采取列宁、斯大林制定的关于新经济政策的基本原则。因此，各国的共产主义者，都必须学习列宁、斯大林关于新经济政策的理论。
    学习列宁、斯大林关于新经济政策的理论，对于我们来说是更具有直接的现实意义。因为我们伟大的祖国正在逐步地过渡到社会主义，现在已着手实现国家工业化的长期建设计划。虽然我国目前的情况和苏联从一九二一年到社会主义建成时期的情况有些不同，例如中国是从一个半殖民地半封建社会，经过新民主主义革命摧毁了旧社会而开始了向社会主义社会过渡等等；但不可否认，我们目前的情况和苏联建设初期的情况是大体上相同的。例如存在着多种经济成分，小农经济占优势，社会主义经济起领导作用等等。因此，列宁、斯大林关于建设社会主义的理论同样是我们必须遵循的，苏联走过的道路在基本上正是我们所要走的，苏联当时所遇到的并加以解决的基本问题也正是我们所遇到并要加以解决的。
    譬如说，列宁、斯大林教导我们，加强城乡经济结合和巩固工农经济联盟，是建设社会主义的根本问题。我们是同样遇到了这问题，为了正确解决这个问题，我们同样需要根据列宁、斯大林的指示：要在一定时期保持商品生产（通过买卖的交换）这个为农民唯一可以接受的与城市进行经济联系的形式。为此，我们要扩大商品流转，发展商业，以促进城乡间的物资交流，并刺激农业的发展和改善农民的生活。在发展商业中，特别要发展国营商业和合作社商业，逐步壮大社会主义经济和半社会主义经济在商业中的阵地，但在一定时期也绝不忽视有利于国计民生的私人商业的积极性。同时在我国存在着私人资本主义经济和大量小商品经济条件下，国家必须利用价值法则，采取正确的价格政策，对市场加以监督、领导和必要的限制，做好稳定物价和调剂供求的工作，有效地制止和打击投机商人的不法行为；并要逐步地适当地缩小工农业产品之间的剪刀差，以刺激农民的生产积极性，也使工业品得到广阔的销路。这样，就可加强城乡间的经济结合和进一步巩固工农之间的联盟，就可以加速以国家工业化为基本任务的经济建设事业。由此可见，在建设社会主义的过程中，商业工作是很重要的很光荣的，我们应当学会商业工作，善于掌握和领导市场，以帮助工农业生产的发展。任何忽视和轻视商业工作的观点都是错误的。
    再譬如说，列宁、斯大林教导我们说，吸引农民参加社会主义建设，对农业实行社会主义的改造，经过合作社是唯一正确的道路。我们是同样遇到了这个问题而且必须根据列宁、斯大林的教导来解决这个问题。我们党中央和毛泽东同志早就指示我们，必须提倡“组织起来”，必须经过互助合作的道路，来逐步实现农业的社会主义改造。互助合作运动，正是把农民引向社会主义的主要桥梁；同时它也是当前发展农业生产和增产粮食所必需的。中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议中说：“党中央从来认为要克服很多农民在分散经营中所发生的困难，要使广大贫困的农民能够迅速地增加生产而走向丰衣足食的道路，要使国家得到比现在多得多的商品粮食及其他工业原料，同时也就提高农民的购买力，使国家的工业品得到广大的销场，就必须提倡‘组织起来’，按照自愿和互利的原则，发展农民互助合作的积极性。这种互助合作在现在是建立在个体经济基础上（农民私有财产的基础上）的集体劳动，其发展前途就是农业集体化或社会主义化。”长期的经验证明，党中央这个方针完全正确的。因此，我们的任务就是，一方面努力实现国家工业化，为彻底改造农业准备条件；一方面要积极推行互助合作运动，耐心地教育农民走组织起来、大家富裕的社会主义的道路，而不是走旧的、使大多数农民贫困的资本主义的道路。同时在推行互助合作运动时，一定要根据客观条件和主观力量，根据农民的需要和觉悟程度，从实际出发，坚持自愿与互利的原则，积极领导，逐步地从低级形式过渡到高级形式，稳步前进，反对急躁冒进的倾向和强迫命令的做法。当然采取消极的放任自流的态度也是错误的。
    此外，关于粮食税和发展农民生产问题，关于对待私人资本主义和利用国家资本主义问题，关于发展大工业以改造整个国民经济的问题等等，在列宁、斯大林关于新经济政策的理论中，都给了我们很大的启发。它不仅可以帮助我们深刻地了解我们党当前的经济政策的内容，而且可以帮助我们了解制定这种政策的理论根据。
    党中央和毛泽东同志在许多文件中都教导我们要好好地学习列宁、斯大林的著作，学习苏联的建设经验，并要善于把这种建设经验运用到我们自己的具体条件下来。今年四月发布的中共中央关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示中，规定全党干部理论学习的高、中级组，要以一年半的时间学习“联共（布）党史”最后四章和列宁、斯大林论社会主义经济建设的一部分著作。这正是为了适应全党在进入经济建设时期所必需的。毛泽东同志在“改造我们的学习”一文中早就指出：“‘苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本’是一百年来全世界共产主义运动的最高的综合和总结，是理论和实际结合的典型，在全世界还只有这一个完全的典型。我们看列宁、斯大林他们是如何把马克思主义的普遍真理和苏联革命的具体实践互相结合又从而发展马克思主义的，就可以知道我们在中国是应该如何地工作了。”为此，我们一定要遵照党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，努力地学习，好好地工作，以便把我们的祖国建设得像苏联一样的富强和美丽。
