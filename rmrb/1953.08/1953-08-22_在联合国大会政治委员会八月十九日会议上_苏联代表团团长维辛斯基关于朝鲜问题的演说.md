The delegations speaking here have already pointed out the significance of the Korean Armistice Agreement signed on July 27th of this year.

This major event does indeed have its important historical significance. At the recent session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, pointed out in his speech:

"For more than three years, the peace and democracy camp has been working to achieve a truce in Korea. The signing of the armistice agreement ended this struggle. The will of hundreds of millions of people demanding peace has become such a powerful and effective force that the aggressors had to take it into account."

The history of the Korean War is educational. The Korean War proved that the interventionists were completely wrong in thinking they could quickly and easily finish the war they launched against the Korean people. The war proved that a people fighting for a just cause is invincible, even if, as G.M. Malenkov said, the most powerful war machine of modern imperialism is used against them; I would like to quote the words of the Soviet government leader here: "Loyalty to the cause of freedom and independence of the motherland has produced great indomitable spirit, courage and collective heroism." In the Korean people's struggle against the interventionists for freedom and independence, the Chinese People's Volunteers who went to help their Korean brothers established great merit in this heroic cause.

The facts are certain, and history and life itself say so.

These facts have received sufficient attention at previous meetings of the United Nations. Therefore, it is not necessary to return to these facts at present, especially now that the United Nations is facing other new tasks, facing very important and practically significant tasks. In any case, the Soviet delegation believes that these new tasks are what we should undertake at present.

At the same time, we believe that it should be emphasized that since the beginning of the war imposed on the Korean people, the Soviet government has strived to stop the war and to conclude an armistice agreement, thereby achieving lasting peace.

As early as July 1950, that is, one month after the armed intervention in Korea began, J.V. Stalin said in his reply to Indian Prime Minister Nehru that it was appropriate to peacefully resolve the Korean issue through the Security Council, which must include representatives of the five major powers, including the People's Republic of China.

At the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1950, the Soviet delegation, together with the delegations of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, and Belarus, proposed a draft resolution stipulating that the United Nations General Assembly make the following recommendations:

(1) The warring parties in Korea shall immediately cease fire.

(2) The United States Government and the governments of other countries shall immediately withdraw their troops from Korea in order to ensure that the Korean people have the opportunity to exercise their sacred and inviolable sovereignty and freely decide their own domestic affairs.

In June 1951, the Soviet government once again suggested that the warring parties begin negotiations on cessation of hostilities and withdrawal of troops from both sides of the 38th parallel as a first step towards a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

In 1951, at the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet delegation, representing the Soviet government, once again suggested that the United Nations General Assembly considered it necessary to:

(1) The parties participating in the hostilities in Korea shall immediately cease fire, sign an armistice agreement, and withdraw their troops from the 38th parallel within ten days. (2) All foreign troops and foreign volunteer forces shall withdraw from Korea within three months.

Presumably everyone still remembers that at the first session of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly in October 1952, the Soviet delegation fully supported the proposal of the People's Republic of Poland, the first few items of which concerned the Korean War issue.

This proposal, in view of the fact that the Korean War had entered its third year at that time, causing huge disasters and poverty, proposed that both sides immediately cease land, sea, and air military operations; immediately resume armistice negotiations, and both sides should do their best to reach an agreement on the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war and the entire prisoner of war issue, in order to strive to remove the obstacles hindering the end of the Korean War. This proposal also stipulated that all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, should be withdrawn from Korea within two or three months; it stipulated that it must be ensured that the Korean issue is resolved peacefully in the spirit of unifying Korea, so that the Korean people can achieve the unification of Korea under the supervision of a committee composed of directly related countries and other countries (including countries that did not participate in the Korean War).

Ladies and gentlemen, you can see that the Soviet government, representing the will of the Soviet people, and in accordance with the interests of the people of all countries in the world and the demands for peace, year after year, made every effort to stop the bloody tragedy in Korea, end the war imposed on the Korean people, which contained the threat of causing a new world war, and ensure peace in Korea and world peace.

The reason why I feel it is necessary to mention this is also because Mr. Munro, the representative of New Zealand, yesterday doubted the peaceful policy of the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union contributed to the attack on South Korea, and he insisted that I admitted this at past sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. Mr. Lodge also supported this unfounded statement. However, neither Mr. Munro's speech nor Mr. Lodge's speech is consistent with the actual situation. This is clear if you pay attention to what I actually said. Although, Munro and Lodge were referring to my speech on March 2, 1953. In that speech, I replied to Lodge that the Soviet Union, in accordance with the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance signed with China as early as 1945 and renewed in 1950, had been and still was selling weapons to China. At that time, I also said that as far as Korea was concerned, the Soviet Union had not concluded a treaty of mutual assistance and alliance with Korea, therefore, the Soviet Union had no obligation to sell weapons to Korea other than selling the remaining Soviet materials to Korea when it withdrew its troops from Korea in 1948, nor could it sell weapons to Korea. Mr. Munro remained silent about this, thus distorting what I actually said. At that time, I also pointed out that the slanderous rumors of the US representative that the Soviet Union sold weapons to Korea were nothing more than repeating similar lies fabricated by MacArthur and Austin as early as 1950, and these fabricated lies had been completely exposed at that time. Some well-known American journalists - "New York Herald Tribune" war correspondent Omer Bigart, NBC correspondent in Taiwan Amos Landman - and London "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in India Eric Downton refuted this. This report was published on four pages in "The Reporter" magazine. You all understand that no one would suspect that "The Reporter" magazine would sympathize with the Soviet Union.

After this, in the second session of the Seventh General Assembly, these slanderous rumors did not reappear. Now, you all hear that these things have appeared again. However, we are not surprised. Obviously, someone is using the same means as last time for ulterior purposes.

But let us return to the main topic.

I think it is unnecessary now to recount all the efforts made by the Korean-Chinese side in the Panmunjom negotiations to overcome numerous difficulties. However, we cannot fail to mention the great contributions of the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the final settlement of the prisoner of war issue. It was they who, after reasonably solving the issue of exchanging sick and wounded prisoners of war, proposed to resolve the entire prisoner of war issue, so that both sides could reach a truce in Korea with the sincerity of mutual concession.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the government of the People's Republic of China, consistently and faithfully adhering to the principles of international law and the Geneva Conventions, in order to eliminate the only and last obstacle on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation procedures, you may remember that they agreed to immediately repatriate all prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation after the armistice, and transfer the remaining prisoners of war to neutral countries to ensure a fair solution to their repatriation issues.

This was in April 1953. Although it was entirely possible to quickly complete the negotiations and sign the armistice agreement at this time, it took more than two months to complete this matter. What was the reason for the delay? This intolerable delay occurred because the Rhee Syngman group adopted a provocative stance, trying every possible means to undermine the signing of the armistice agreement.

Speaking of this, I cannot fail to mention the serious sabotage by the Rhee Syngman elements of the agreement on the exchange of prisoners of war. At that time, they forcibly took away more than 27,000 prisoners of war from the Korean-Chinese side, attempting to undermine the agreement that had been reached by this criminal means. Now I will not talk about this matter in detail, I just want to point out that the American authorities in Korea played a strange role in this matter, watching the entire provocative action happen with their eyes open.

All the actions of the Rhee Syngman elements prove that the reactionary group resisting a peaceful solution to the Korean issue is still trying to obstruct the peaceful unification of Korea on a democratic basis and obstruct the smooth resolution of this major issue. The United Nations Organization, the United Nations General Assembly, and the Political Committee should pay attention to this.

It is no secret to anyone that the provocative tricks of the Rhee Syngman elements are supported by the American reactionary group.

As can be seen from Mr. Dulles' statement on August 7th of this year, the US State Department has reached an agreement with the Rhee Syngman group to prepare to take joint action in accordance with Rhee Syngman's plan, including withdrawing from future political conferences at the appropriate time stipulated in this plan. Everyone also knows that Mr. Dulles' statement included a passage saying: "An agreement has been reached (referring to the Rhee Syngman group) not to take unilateral action during the political conference, using military means to unify Korea." These words, these words, this kind of statement actually came from the mouth of the US Secretary of State, and its significance deserves careful consideration and deliberation! It turns out that an agreement has been reached with Rhee Syngman not to take unilateral action, using military means to unify Korea. What does this mean? This means that they will not re-launch the war against North Korea, nor will they resume this war, but only during the political conference. May I ask, what will happen after this period has passed? Such a statement cannot be ignored. Because it openly supports the Rhee Syngman group's demand to unify Korea by force, in other words, by war. Attempting to conquer North Korea under the guise of so-called "unification" of Korea - this is the Rhee Syngman group's arrogant old plan. In previous meetings, we presented many facts that irrefutably proved this. These facts, of course, have also been recorded in the minutes of the Political Committee of the General Assembly, and we will reiterate these facts when necessary.

In assessing the situation after the signing of the armistice agreement, we must pay special attention to the fact that immediately after the signing of the armistice agreement, the United States and South Korea concluded the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty." Even the American reactionary newspapers had to admit that this treaty was an important link in a series of steps taken by the reactionary group to ensure that the United States armed forces have bases convenient for future possible military aggression in the Pacific region.

Of course, although this treaty mentions so-called "mutual defense" and mentions that the two sides signing this treaty seem to hope that "the peoples and governments of all countries will coexist peacefully," it cannot deceive people. Although it uses rhetoric such as so-called "collective defense rights" or the need to establish an "effective system of regional security" in the Pacific, it cannot deceive people. The reason why these rhetorics will not and cannot deceive anyone is because everyone already knows that this type of rhetoric has become an old cliché in those aggressive agreements, and it is only used to conceal the essence of these agreements.

To understand the true intention of this treaty, just pay attention to the fact that, for example, Article 3 of the treaty states that one of the contracting parties will recognize the territory that may be transferred to the jurisdiction of the other party in the future as the territory legally under the jurisdiction of the other party.

This Article 3 is of course very clear, and its purpose will not cause any doubt.

Or, let's take a look at Article 4, which stipulates that the United States (as the article says) has the right to station sea, land, and air armed forces "in the territory of South Korea and near the territory of South Korea." In the territory of South Korea and near the territory of South Korea! This clearly illustrates their expansionist policy, and the entire mutual defense treaty serves this policy.

This treaty gives the United States the right to station armed forces in the territory of South Korea. This treaty was signed immediately after the United States signed the Korean armistice agreement; and as everyone knows, the Korean armistice agreement stipulates that one of the issues to be discussed at the political conference is the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

Two absolutely contradictory treaties were signed almost at the same time! Everyone knows that the declaration of the sixteen countries participating in the armed intervention in Korea is directly related to the mutual defense treaty. This declaration guarantees in advance that if military adventurers launch a new war in the Far East, they will participate in it. Naturally, in this case, it is impossible not to use beautiful words to conceal the evil purpose.

This declaration has also caused serious panic in all sectors of society in Western countries. This can be seen from the remarks of the British conservative "Observer." This newspaper justly pointed out that this declaration means that "if a new local event occurs in Korea, there is a danger of causing a Third World War."

We should also pay attention to the remarks of Driberg, a well-known British Labor MP, published in "Reynold's News," who said: "Certain people in Korea (referring to South Korea) and Washington are trying to undermine the armistice agreement and hope to start a greater bloody war for Rhee Syngman (and undoubtedly also for Chiang Kai-shek)." He also said: "I hope there is no such person in London."

The "Observer" also pointed out a surprising fact, that the United Nations "maintained complete silence" about Rhee Syngman's open threats. This fact cannot but be given serious attention.

Gentlemen, this is the political environment on the eve of the political conference, which will face some major issues that the Korean people and all peace-loving people are extremely concerned about and hope to resolve smoothly. The task now is to help the Korean people restore their national economy as soon as possible and most effectively, help them rebuild a peaceful life, and help them heal the serious wounds brought to them by the war. Everyone knows that, in view of the extreme importance of this task, the Soviet government has decided to immediately allocate 1 billion rubles for the restoration of Korea's devastated economy. In our opinion, this session of the United Nations General Assembly should formulate some measures that can promote the success of the political conference. The political conference will be convened in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 60 of the armistice agreement, to resolve issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue through consultation.

The Soviet government's attitude in this regard is: to continue to adhere to a peaceful policy, strive for a peaceful resolution of all issues, and do everything possible to make this matter a success, starting from the premise that Koreans should resolve disputes themselves through consultations between South and North Korea. In this regard, special attention must be paid to such major issues as the form and membership of the political conference.

We believe that the suggestion to form the conference based on the principle of opposing parties is wrong. The United States and those countries that support the United States that signed the No. 151 proposal presented here have adopted this position. We believe that such a position, as I have said, is wrong.

The reason why this form of conference composition is wrong can be seen from the fact that those who are concerned about the correct composition of the political conference are not only the two parties mentioned in Article 4, Paragraph 60, but also the people of all peace-loving countries, especially the people of countries neighboring Korea. The drafters of the above proposal ignored this very important situation and insisted on their own interpretation of Article 4, Paragraph 60 of the armistice agreement. For example, Mr. Lodge said in his speech yesterday that the United States insists on Article 60 and the concept of "both parties" in it, and only representatives of both parties should participate in the political conference. He read out Article 4, Paragraph 60, but he obviously did not notice that this article in no way means that the representatives of "both parties" (as stated in Paragraph 60) are limited to countries participating in the hostilities. There is nothing in Paragraph 60 that suggests that only countries participating in the hostilities can be nominated as representatives by both parties. This is of great significance for correctly understanding Paragraph 60. In fact, what is the essence of Paragraph 60? We believe that its essence is very simple. That is: First, both parties shall convene a political conference within three months after the armistice agreement comes into effect to resolve issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue through consultation (this is the main content of the agreement).

Second, this conference is at a higher level.

Third, the representatives of this conference will be nominated by both parties.

According to the drafters of the proposal of the group of countries headed by the United States, first of all Mr. Lodge, according to the interpretation of Paragraph 60, only the countries nominated by each party, and countries that participated in the war, can participate in the political conference. It is written in black and white, and the fifteen-nation proposal is written like this.

It can be seen from this that the proposal defended by the US delegation is based on the principle that the conference is composed of opposing parties. Therefore, the above proposal does not include the provision that other member states of the United Nations participate in the political conference. Mr. Lodge frankly said that this is indeed the case, and their proposal does not include any provisions regarding the participation of other member states of the United Nations in the conference. He believes that these countries "must not participate in either of the 'two parties' stipulated in Paragraph 60."

At the same time, Mr. Lodge admitted yesterday that some countries are concerned about this (as he said) "region" and are concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Although Mr. Lodge admitted this, the proposal defended by the US delegation and the delegations of certain other countries did not stipulate that these countries should participate in the political conference, but attempted to arbitrarily exclude these countries from this conference in the above-mentioned manner, regardless of how concerned these countries were about participating in this conference. Obviously, Mr. Lodge cannot justify himself here. But this does not embarrass us in any way. What is important is that this kind of provision cannot naturally be considered to be conventional. Moreover, this provision is unreasonable both from the perspective of organizing the most authoritative international conference (the political conference stipulated in Article 4, Paragraph 60 of the Korean armistice agreement should be such a conference) and from the perspective of ensuring that the conference achieves the maximum success.

Mr. Lodge himself said yesterday that if the General Assembly wants to suggest inviting any other country to participate in the conference, then - as Mr. Lodge emphasized - it is also logically inconsistent why some other Korean neighboring countries that are directly concerned about the region should not be invited to participate in the conference.

Truth is truth after all. Those countries that neighbor Korea and are directly concerned about the region, as Mr. Lodge said - of course, neighboring countries are more concerned than any other country - if they are not included in the members of the political conference for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, then of course there is no reason.

Since Lodge put forward this argument, but denied the necessity of inviting countries other than the belligerents to participate in the political conference in the name of the General Assembly, he overthrew the foundation of the entire proposal that he and others drafted. At the same time, the complete illogicality of the recommendations in this proposal has become more obvious.

Therefore, Lodge's interpretation of Paragraph 60 is not based on any evidence. The fact that two other supplementary proposals on the membership of the political conference have been put forward at the meeting of the Political Committee shows that Lodge's interpretation is unfounded and that the proposal put forward by the fifteen delegations is unsatisfactory.

Why were these two proposals put forward? Why is there a need for a supplementary proposal put forward in the name of Australia and New Zealand, and another supplementary proposal put forward in the name of four countries of the British Commonwealth? If the fifteen countries have already reached an agreement on the basic position, then one must ask, why are these two proposals still needed? Why couldn't the suggestions in these two proposals be merged into a general proposal? This question hits the nail on the head. The answer to this question is also very obvious: the two proposals were put forward to create the impression that the opinions on the main proposal seem to be consistent, but in fact the opinions of the fifteen delegations are not consistent, because at least the four delegations hold another view.

These two proposals, just like the speeches of British representative Lloyd, French representative Maurice Schumann, and today's speech of Canadian representative, can only prove that the fifteen-nation proposal headed by the United States cannot be used as the basis for resolving the issue of conference membership. The position of the leading country in this group of fifteen delegations, I think can be described by the German proverb: "They want to wash the fur, but they don't want to get the fur wet."

French representative Maurice Schumann said correctly yesterday that we should not be too literal about Paragraph 60, and the political conference should not be composed of opposing parties. It can be seen from Lloyd's speech that the British delegation also adopted this position, although the British delegation, like the French delegation, is a co-proposer of the fifteen-nation proposal, and this proposal is based on completely opposite principles.

As for the Soviet Union, we firmly believe that the political conference can only be successful if it is convened on the basis of the principle of the "round table conference." We believe that the conference can only be successful if it is convened on the basis of the principle of the "round table conference," with not only representatives of both parties participating, but also representatives of other countries concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. According to Article 10 of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations has the right to make recommendations on any issue within the scope of the Charter, especially issues related to the maintenance of international peace and security. Naturally, when making recommendations, the United Nations General Assembly must consider the maximum political rationality of these recommendations and consider whether they fully comply with the principles, purposes, and tasks stipulated in the United Nations Charter.

I think it must be pointed out that the Soviet proposal believes that the conference will not adopt resolutions by voting. Therefore, all resolutions of the conference must be agreed to by both parties signing the armistice agreement before they can be adopted. The Soviet delegation's proposal is in line with the universally recognized international principle of "round table conference." It fully complies with the interests of all peace-loving people and the interests of peace and international security.

The Soviet delegation hopes that this proposal will receive the support of the vast majority of the committee, and the Soviet Union is also deeply convinced that the political conference composed on this basis will be able to successfully solve the important issues facing the conference.

### 在联合国大会政治委员会八月十九日会议上  苏联代表团团长维辛斯基关于朝鲜问题的演说

专栏：

    在联合国大会政治委员会八月十九日会议上
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基关于朝鲜问题的演说
    在这里发言的代表团已经指出了今年七月二十七日签订的朝鲜停战协定的意义。
    这件大事的确是有其重大的历史意义的。在苏联最高苏维埃不久以前举行的会议上，苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫在其演说中指出：
     “有三年多的时间，和平民主阵营一直在为争取朝鲜停战而努力。停战协定的签订结束了这种斗争。千百万人要求和平的意志变成了这样强大和有效的力量，以致侵略者不得不加以考虑。”
    朝鲜战争的历史是有教育意义的。朝鲜战争证明了，干涉者对朝鲜人民发动战争时，原想不费力气地很快一下子就打完这个仗，结果却大错特错了。战争证明，为正义事业而战斗的人民是不可战胜的，即使，如格·马·马林科夫所说的那样，对他们使用现代帝国主义最强大的战争机器；我在这里还要引苏联政府领袖的话：“对祖国的自由和独立的事业的忠诚，产生了伟大的不屈不挠的精神、勇气和集体英雄主义。”在朝鲜人民反对干涉者、争取自由和独立的斗争中，前往帮助朝鲜兄弟的中国人民志愿军，在这个英雄的事业中建立了伟大的功绩。
    确定不移的事实是这样说的，历史和生活本身也是这样说的。
    这些事实，在联合国以前的会议上已经受到足够的注意。因而，目前不必要再回到这些事实上面，特别是在现在联合国正面临着其他的新任务，面临着十分重要和具有巨大的实际意义的任务的时候。无论如何苏联代表团认为，这些新任务是我们目前所应当承担的。
    同时，我们认为应该着重指出，自从强加于朝鲜人民的战争一开始，苏联政府就力求停止这个战争，力求缔结停战协定，从而获致持久和平。
    早在一九五零年七月，即武装干涉朝鲜开始了一个月以后，约·维·斯大林在给印度总理尼赫鲁的复电中就已经说到，经由包括中国人民政府在内的五大国的代表必须参加的安全理事会，来使朝鲜问题得到和平处理，是适宜的。
    就在一九五○年联合国第五届大会上，苏联代表团会同波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰、及白俄罗斯代表团提出一项决议草案，规定联合国大会提出下列建议：
    （一）在朝鲜交战的双方立即停战。
    （二）美国政府及其他各国政府立即撤出其在朝鲜的军队，以便保证朝鲜人民有机会行使其神圣不可侵犯的主权，自由决定其自己国内的事务。
    在一九五一年六月苏联政府曾再次建议：交战双方开始关于停止敌对行动以及双方把军队撤离三八线的谈判，作为和平解决朝鲜问题的第一个步骤。
    一九五一年在联合国第六届大会上，苏联代表团代表苏联政府又一次建议联合国大会认为必须：
    （一）朝鲜境内敌对行动的参与各方立即停火，签订停战协定，并在十天以内把他们的军队撤离三十八度线。（二）一切外国军队以及外国志愿部队在三个月内撤出朝鲜。
    想必大家都还记得，在一九五二年十月联合国第七届大会第一期会议上，苏联代表团全力支持波兰人民共和国的提案，这个提案中的前几项是关于朝鲜战争问题的。
    这个提案鉴于朝鲜战争当时已经进入第三个年头，它造成了巨大的灾难与穷困，因而建议双方立即停止陆、海、空军事行动；立即恢复停战谈判，双方要尽力在交换病伤战俘问题和整个战俘问题上达成协议，以便努力扫除阻碍结束朝鲜战争的障碍。这个提案同时规定所有外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内，在两、三个月之内一律撤出朝鲜；规定必须保证在统一朝鲜的精神下和平解决朝鲜问题，使朝鲜人民能在一个委员会的监督下实现朝鲜的统一，这个委员会应由直接有关国家及其它国家
    （包括没有参加朝鲜战争的国家在内）组成。
    各位先生，你们可以看到，苏联政府代表苏联人民的意志，并根据全世界各国人民的利益与和平要求，一年复一年地尽了一切努力以期停止朝鲜的流血惨剧，结束强加于朝鲜人民身上的、并蕴藏过引起新的世界大战的威胁的战争，保证朝鲜和平和世界和平。
    我所以认为必须提一提这一点，还由于昨天新西兰代表孟罗先生曾经怀疑苏联的和平政策，说什么苏联促成了对南朝鲜的进攻，而且他还硬说我在过去的联合国大会上承认了这一点。洛奇先生也支持了这种没有任何根据的说法。但是，无论是孟罗先生的发言，还是洛奇先生的发言，都是不符合实际情况的。只要注意到我真正说过些什么话，这一点就很清楚了。虽然，孟罗和洛奇指的是我一九五三年三月二日的发言。在那次发言中，我回答洛奇说，苏联按照早在一九四五年就已和中国签订的、后来在一九五○年又重新签订的友好同盟条约，曾经而且现在还在以武器卖给中国。当时我又说，至于朝鲜，苏联并没有和朝鲜订立同盟互助条约，因此，苏联除了在一九四八年从朝鲜撤退军队的时候把苏联的剩余物资卖给朝鲜以外，苏联是没有义务卖给朝鲜而且也不能卖给朝鲜武器的。孟罗先生对于这一点却闭口不言，因而把我真正说过的话歪曲了。当时我还指出，美国代表所谓苏联以武器卖给朝鲜的诽谤谰言只不过是重复麦克阿瑟和奥斯汀早在一九五○年就制造过的类似的谎言罢了，这些制造出来的谎言当时就已完全被戳穿了。一些有名的美国记者——“纽约先驱论坛报”战地记者欧默尔·比加特、全国广播公司驻台湾记者埃摩斯·兰德曼——以及伦敦“每日电讯报”驻印度记者埃里克·唐顿曾驳斥了这一点。这个报道在“展望”杂志上整整登载了四页。你们都很明白，谁也不会怀疑“展望”杂志会同情苏联的。
    在这以后，在七届联大的第二期会议中，这些诽谤谰言就没有再出现。现在，你们都听到，这些东西又出现了。不过，我们并不奇怪。显然，有人为了不可告人的目的，又采用和上次相同的手段了。
    但是，让我们还是言归正传罢。
    我认为现在无需再追述朝中方面在板门店谈判中为了克服重重困难所作的一切努力。但是，我们不能不提到中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在最后解决战俘问题中的巨大的功绩。正是它们，在合理地解决了交换病伤战俘问题以后，建议解决整个战俘问题，以使双方用互相让步的诚意达成朝鲜停战。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府，始终不渝地忠实于国际法原则和日内瓦公约，为了消除关于战俘遣返程序问题上唯一的和最后的障碍，你们可以记得，它们同意在停战后立即遣返一切坚持遣返的战俘，而将其余的战俘转交中立国，以保证对他们的遣返问题的公正解决。
    这是一九五三年四月间的事情。虽然在这时候已完全有可能迅速完成谈判和签订停战协定，但却多费了两个多月的时间才完成这件事。拖延的原因在哪里呢？这种不可容忍的拖延情形之所以发生，是因为李承晚集团采取挑衅的立场，千方百计地来破坏停战协定的签订。
    谈到这里，我不能不提一提李承晚分子严重破坏关于交换战俘协议的情况。当时他们强制带走了二万七千多名朝中方面的战俘，企图用这种罪恶的手段破坏已经达成的协议。现在我不来源源本本谈这个问题，我只想指出：在朝鲜的美国当局在这件事中扮演了奇怪的角色，它睁眼看着整个挑衅行动发生。
    李承晚分子的全部行径证明，抗拒和平解决朝鲜问题的反动集团直到现在还仍然企图用一切办法阻挠在民主的基础上和平统一朝鲜，阻挠顺利解决这一主要问题。联合国组织、联合国大会、政治委员会应该注意到这一点。
    李承晚分子的挑衅把戏是得到美国反动集团的支持的，这对谁都不是秘密了。
    从杜勒斯先生今年八月七日发表的声明中可以看出，美国国务院已和李承晚集团达成协议，准备按照李承晚的计划采取共同行动，包括在这个计划所预定的合适的时刻退出未来的政治会议在内。大家也都知道，杜勒斯先生的声明中，有一段这样说：“已取得协议（指与李承晚集团）在政治会议期间不采取片面行动，用军事手段来统一朝鲜。”这些话，这些字眼，这种声明竟出自美国国务卿之口，其意义值得好好考虑，好好揣摩！原来，已和李承晚取得协议，不采取片面行动，用军事手段来统一朝鲜。这是什么意思呢？这意思就是说，只不过在政治会议期间不重新向北朝鲜发动战争，不恢复这个战争。请问，这段时期过去后将会发生什么事情呢？对这样一个声明是不能忽视的。因为它露骨地支持李承晚集团用武力，换句话说，用战争来统一朝鲜的要求。企图在所谓“统一”朝鲜的幌子下征服北朝鲜——这是李承晚集团狂妄的老计划了。在以往历次会议中，我们提出了许多事实无可争辩地证明了这一点。这些事实，当然也已经记入了大会政治委员会的纪录中，必要时，我们将重提这些事实。
    在估计停战协定签订后所发生的局势时，不能不特别注意这一事实，就是在停战协定签订之后，美国与南朝鲜立刻缔结了所谓“共同防御条约”。甚至美国反动报纸也不得不承认，这一条约是反动集团为了保证美国武装部队拥有便于将来可能在太平洋区域进行军事侵略行动的基地而采取的一些步骤中的重要的一环。
    当然，尽管这条约提到所谓“共同防御”，提到这一条约签字的双方似乎希望“各国人民和各国政府和平共处”，它是迷惑不了人的。尽管它使用了所谓“集体防御权利”、或是必须在太平洋建立“区域安全的有效体系”一类词藻，它是迷惑不了人的。这些词藻之所以不会、也不能迷惑任何人，是因为这一类的词藻，大家都已知道，已经成为那些侵略性的协定中的老套，它只是为了掩饰这些协定的本质。
    要弄清这一条约的真正用意，只要注意一下就成，例如，条约第三条中有一段话说缔约的一方将承认将来可能转归另一方管辖的领土为另一方合法管辖的领土。
    这第三条当然是非常明白的，它的目的也不会引起任何怀疑。
    或者，我们来看看第四条，这条规定美国（如条文所说）“在南朝鲜的领土上和靠近南朝鲜的领土上”拥有驻扎海、陆、空武装力量的权利。在南朝鲜的领土上和靠近南朝鲜的领土！这条十分明显地说明他们的扩张政策，整个共同防御条约也是为这个政策服务的。
    这个条约给予美国在南朝鲜的领土上驻扎武装部队的权利，这个条约是在美国刚签订了朝鲜停战协定以后立刻就签订的；而大家知道，朝鲜停战协定规定了政治会议上要讨论的问题之一就是一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题。
    两个绝对相反的条约几乎是在同一时间内签订的！大家知道，和共同防御条约有着直接联系的还有十六个参加对朝鲜武装干涉的国家的宣言，这个宣言预先保证，假如军事冒险家再发动远东的新战争，它们将要参加到里面去。自然，在这种情况下，不使用漂亮言辞来掩饰罪恶目的是不成的。
    这个宣言就是在西方世界国家的社会各界中也引起严重的惊慌。关于这一点，从英国保守的“观察家报”的言论中可以看得出。这家报纸公正地指出，这个宣言意味着“如果朝鲜发生新的地方事件，就有着引起第三次世界大战的危险”。
    也应该注意一下刊载在“雷诺新闻”上的英国著名工党议员德里柏的言论，他说道：“朝鲜（指南朝鲜）和华盛顿的某些人士正在竭力破坏停战协定，并希望开始替李承晚（毫无疑问也替蒋介石）进行更大的流血战争。”他并且说：“我希望伦敦没有这种人”。
    “观察家报”也指出一个令人惊奇的事实，就是联合国对李承晚的公开威胁“保持完全的缄默”。这一事实实在是不能不加以严重注意的。
    先生们，这就是政治会议前夕的政治环境，这个会议将面临朝鲜人民以及全体爱好和平的人民极为关心的、希望顺利解决的一些重大问题。现在的任务是帮助朝鲜人民尽快地和最有效地恢复其国民经济，帮助他们重建和平的生活，帮助他们医治战争带给他们的重创。大家知道，苏联政府鉴于这一任务的极端重要，已作出决定，立即拨款十亿卢布作为恢复朝鲜的遭受破坏的经济之用。据我们的意见，这一届联合国大会应该制定一些可以促进政治会议成功的措施。政治会议将遵照停战协定第四条第六十款召开，通过协商解决从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题。
    苏联政府在这方面的态度是：继续坚持和平政策，争取和平解决一切问题，从朝鲜人应该通过南、北朝鲜进行协商的方法自己解决争端的前提出发，竭尽全力来使这件事情获得成功。在这方面，必须特别注意这样一些重大问题，例如政治会议的形式及其成员问题。
    我们认为，根据对立双方的原则来组成会议的建议是错误的。而美国以及在此间提出的第一五一号提案上签字的那些支持美国的各国所采取的正是这种立场。我们认为，这样一种立场，正如我所说过的，是错误的。
    会议这种组成形式之所以错误从这里可以看出：关心政治会议的正确组成的不仅是第四条第六十款中所提到的双方，而且还有一切爱好和平的各国人民，首先是与朝鲜为邻的国家的人民。上述提案的起草人不顾这一十分重要的情况，而坚持他们自己对停战协定第四条第六十款的解释。 譬如，洛奇先生在他昨天的发言中说，美国坚持第六十款以及其中关于双方一词的概念，只有双方代表应当参加政治会议。他宣读了第四条第六十款，但是他显然没有注意到，这一款决不意味着“双方”（如第六十款所说的）代表只限于参加敌对行动的国家。第六十款中没有任何地方暗示，只有参加敌对行动的国家才可被双方提名为代表。这对于正确地理解第六十款具有重大的意义。实际上，第六十款的实质是什么呢？我们认为，它的实质非常简单。这就是：第一，双方在停战协定生效后三个月内召开政治会议，通过协商来解决从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题（这就是这个协议的主要内容）。
    第二，这个会议是高一级的。
    第三，这个会议的代表将由双方提名。
    根据以美国为首的一些国家的集团的提案的起草人，首先是洛奇先生，对第六十款的解释，参加政治会议的只能是每一方提名的国家，而且要是参加战争的国家。白纸上写着黑字，十五国提案就是这样写着的。
    由此可见，美国代表团所辩护的提案是根据会议以对立双方为基础来组成的原则的。因此，上述提案中没有包括联合国其他会员国参加政治会议的规定。洛奇先生直率地说，的确如此，他们的提案中没有包括任何关于联合国其他会员国参加会议的规定。他认为，这些国家“不得参加第六十款中所规定的双方的任何一方”。
    同时，洛奇先生昨天承认，有些国家是关心这个
    （如他所说）“地区”，关心和平解决朝鲜问题的。虽然洛奇先生这样承认，但美国代表团和某些其他国家的代表团所辩护的提案并没有规定这些国家参加政治会议，而是企图用上述方式专横地将这些国家排除在这个会议之外，不管这些国家如何关心参加这个会议。显然，洛奇先生在这里是不能自圆其说的。但是，这对我们倒并没有什么为难的地方，重要的是：这种规定自然不能认为是合乎常规的。而且无论是从组织最权威的国际会议（朝鲜停战协定第六十款所规定的政治会议应当是这样的会议）的观点来看，还是从必须保证会议获得最大限度的成功的观点来看，这种规定都是不合理的。
    洛奇先生本人昨天说，如果大会要建议邀请其他任何国家参加会议，那末——正如洛奇所着重指出的——逻辑上也说不通为什么不应邀请其他一些直接关心这个地区的朝鲜邻国参加会议。
    真理毕竟是真理。那些和朝鲜为邻而又如洛奇先生所说的直接关心这个地区的国家——当然，邻国比任何其他国家更为关心——如果不被包括在和平解决朝鲜问题的政治会议的成员中，那当然是没有任何理由的。
    洛奇既然提出这种论点，却又否认用大会名义邀请参战国以外的国家参加政治会议的必要性，他这就推翻了他和别人一道草拟的整个提案的基础。同时，这个提案中的建议的完全不合逻辑这一点也更变得明显了。
    因此，洛奇对第六十款的解释是丝毫没有根据的。在政治委员会会议上已有另外两个关于政治会议成员的补充提案提出，这个事实说明了洛奇的那种解释是毫无根据的，说明了十五个代表团所提出的提案是不能令人满意的。
    为什么要提出这两个提案呢？为什么需要一个用澳大利亚和新西兰的名义提出的补充提案，另一个用英联邦四个国家的名义提出的补充提案呢？如果十五个国家已经在基本立场上达成协议，那么就要问，为什么还需要这两个提案呢？为什么不能把这两个提案中的建议合并到一个总的提案中提出呢？这个问题问的恰中要害。而对这个问题的回答也是十分明显的：这两个提案的提出是为了造成一种印象，即似乎在主要提案上意见是一致的，而实际上十五国代表团的意见并不一致，因为至少四国代表团抱着另一种见解。
    这两个提案，正像英国代表劳埃德先生的发言、法国代表莫里斯·舒曼先生的发言、今天加拿大代表的发言一样，只能证明，以美国为首的十五国提案不能作为解决会议成员问题的基础。这个十五国代表团集团里的领导国家的立场，我觉得可以用德国谚语来形容：“他们要洗皮，又要使皮不沾湿。”
    法国代表莫里斯·舒曼先生昨天说得对，对第六十款不要太咬文嚼字，政治会议不要由对立的双方组成。从劳埃德先生的发言中可以看出，英国代表团也采取这个立场，虽然英国代表团和法国代表团一样是十五国提案的共同提出者，而这个提案是根据完全相反的原则提出的。
    至于苏联，我们坚决认为，政治会议只有根据“圆桌会议”的原则召开才能成功。我们认为，会议只有根据“圆桌会议”的原则召开，不仅有双方代表参加，而且有关心和平解决朝鲜问题的其他国家代表参加，才能成功。根据联合国宪章第十条，联合国有权对宪章范围内的任何问题，首先是有关维护国际和平和安全的问题提出建议。自然，联合国大会在提出建议的时候，必须考虑这些建议的最大限度的政治合理性，考虑它们是否完全符合联合国宪章中所规定的原则、宗旨和任务。
    我认为，必须指出，苏联的提案中认为，会议将不采取投票的方式通过决议，因此，会议的一切决议必须得到签订停战协定双方的同意，才可以通过。苏联代表团的提案是符合众所公认的国际“圆桌会议”的原则的。它完全符合所有爱好和平的人民的利益，符合和平和国际安全的利益。
    苏联代表团希望这个提案能获得委员会的绝大多数的支持，苏联并且深信，在这样的基础上组成的政治会议将能够很成功地解决摆在会议面前的重要问题。（新华社据塔斯社纽约二十一日电）
