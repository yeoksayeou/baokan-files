    Northeast Institute of Technology Should Correct Unreasonable Use of Teachers
    Li Ming from Harbin Institute of Technology writes: The Northeast Institute of Technology originally had a Department of Mechanical Engineering with majors such as Mechanical Manufacturing. Starting this year, the school decided to focus on mining and metallurgy, merging the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Departments into a Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and discontinuing the Mechanical Manufacturing major, forcing teachers to "change professions" and teach other courses. For example, Zhang Xiling, the head of the Mechanical Manufacturing Teaching and Research Group, taught "Machine Tools" at the Northeast Institute of Technology for two years with good teaching results. However, the school is now giving him six months of self-study time, after which he will be required to teach the "In-Pit Transportation" course in the Mining Department. In-pit transportation and machine tools are two completely unrelated courses. The decision by Northeast Institute of Technology is equivalent to asking Zhang Xiling to completely abandon what he has learned about machine tools in the past and learn a new set of skills from scratch, while other schools cannot find teachers to teach machine tools. There are other similar situations. Many veteran professors are very uneasy when they hear that they have to "change professions" because they have great difficulty putting aside the courses they have taught for many years and teaching completely unrelated courses. I believe that the practice of wasting talent by the Northeast Institute of Technology is very unreasonable.

    东北工学院应该纠正不合理地使用教师的做法
    哈尔滨工业大学郦明来信：东北工学院原设机械系，有机械制造等专业。今年起，该校决定以采矿冶金为重点，将机械、电机两系合并为机电系，停办机械制造专业，让教师“改行”另教其他课程。如机械制造教学研究组组长张锡龄在东北工学院教了两年“工具机”，教学效果很好；但现在校方给他半年自修时间，以后就要他教采矿系的“坑内运输”课程。坑内运输和工具机是两门毫不相关的课程，东北工学院这个决定，就等于要张锡龄把过去所学工具机方面的东西完全搁起来而从头另学一套，但是其他学校需要教工具机的教师却请不到。其它类似的情况还有，很多老教授听说要“改行”都非常不安心，因为让他们搁下教了多年的课程而改教完全不相关的课程，他们是有很大困难的。我以为东北工学院这样浪费人才的做法是很不合理的。
