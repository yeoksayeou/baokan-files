A Visit with the Chairman of the Honggang Woolen Mill Joint Factory Trade Union
By our Moscow Correspondent Li He

I recently visited the Honggang Woolen Mill Joint Factory in Moscow twice: once to interview the chairman of the factory's trade union, and another time to speak with the workshop director and foremen.

The Honggang Woolen Mill Joint Factory is the birthplace of the Soviet Union's "Excellent Quality Products" movement. Zhutkikh, the initiator of this movement, was then the deputy foreman of this factory. The factory has been in operation for ninety-four years, and the buildings and machinery are mostly old, but due to the efforts of all the workers, it remains at the forefront of Soviet textile enterprises. I walked through the various workshops. Although the buildings are old, they are clean, well-lit, and the temperature is regulated to avoid stuffiness; although the machines are old, they are fully utilized and equipped with safety devices. There have been no accidents in the past three years. One factory has been completely equipped with new looms, and the female workers are working diligently and quietly.

Factory Director Comrade Berevin and Party Committee Secretary Comrade Belyayev accompanied us on the tour. According to the factory director, the Honggang Woolen Mill Joint Factory has been paying attention to product quality for several years, and in the first quarter of 1953, it received the title of "Excellent Quality Products" factory. Since the beginning of the year, all employees have overproduced 370,000 meters of woolen fabric and have over-fulfilled the task of increasing product varieties. The factory is undergoing reconstruction. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, it will produce 3 to 4 million meters more woolen fabric annually than it does now.

When we met with Comrade Komissarov, the chairman of the factory trade union, in the office of the factory's Party committee, he had just returned from sending the employees' children to summer camp. Comrade Komissarov is a very experienced trade union worker. He began working in the trade union in 1926, serving as a trade union group leader, workshop trade union chairman, and in 1928, he became the factory trade union chairman. From 1938, he served as the state trade union chairman for ten years. Later, he voluntarily returned to the factory as a foreman, and in 1948, he was re-elected as the factory trade union chairman. During the conversation, I found that he belonged to the "do more, talk less" type of person. But he still tirelessly answered the series of questions I asked.

The trade union committee of the Honggang Joint Factory is under the leadership of the Moscow State Trade Union Committee and the Central Committee of the Light Industry and Food Industry Trade Union. As a relatively large enterprise, the Honggang factory trade union committee also often receives instructions directly from the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, such as those related to the promotion of new initiatives. The factory trade union committee reports its work to the state trade union committee and, when necessary, also writes letters to the Central Committee of the Light Industry and Food Industry Trade Union. The factory's Party committee directly leads the factory trade union committee on a daily basis.

The factory trade union committee is under the leadership and supervision of the factory Party committee. The Party organization leads the socialist emulation drive through the trade union. The Party committee regularly provides the trade union committee with policy instructions. The Party committee secretary attends the meetings of the factory trade union committee every time, and sometimes the deputy secretary also attends. They point out the direction of the trade union work and remind them of the issues that need attention. Some matters that the trade union cannot resolve through administrative channels are resolved with the help of the Party organization. The trade union committee reports its overall work to the factory Party committee twice a year. Two to three weeks before the report, an inspection committee of fifteen to eighteen people is organized, led by a member of the Party committee, and includes Party members and non-Party workers, to inspect the work of the factory trade union committee and the workshop trade union committee. The inspection committee presents its opinions after the factory trade union chairman reports to the Party committee. Therefore, Party work and trade union work are closely related but not mutually replaceable in the factory. For example, the factory recently held a representative meeting on quality issues. The preparation work for the meeting's agenda and discussion topics was the responsibility of the trade union committee; the preparation situation and the meeting's decisions were reviewed by the Party committee. Another example is that the factory's propagandists work under the leadership of the Party organization. The propagandists publicize to the workers (reading newspapers, discussions, etc.) based on the topics and content instructed by the Party organization, the trade union is responsible for organizing workers to participate, and the quality of the publicity is checked by the Party organization.

The trade union assists the administration in all aspects. The factory director and the factory trade union committee maintain a close relationship. The factory implements a system of one-man responsibility for the director, but except for instructions from superiors that must be followed, the director generally consults with the trade union chairman on all matters. Even matters decided by the factory director alone are notified to the trade union. Whenever the general administration of the Ministry of Industry issues a production plan, the factory director and the trade union chairman jointly study how to ensure its completion and then bring it to the employees for discussion. Before the upcoming representative meeting on quality issues, the administration and the trade union jointly decided who would make the report, draft resolutions, and so on. The use of the factory director's fund is also solicited for the trade union's opinion. This year, the factory trade union issued 150 recuperation vouchers to employees, and in addition, used the factory director's fund to supplement another 100 recuperation vouchers. This year, 100,000 rubles have been allocated from the factory director's fund to purchase recuperation vouchers and subsidies for workers who need material assistance, and 200,000 rubles have been allocated to repair workers' housing. In the summer, the factory's kindergartens and nurseries will be moved to the cool suburbs. The relocation work could not be done solely by the administration, and the trade union mobilized the children's parents to help complete it. The administration and the trade union sign a collective contract every year. The draft collective contract is first discussed at workers' meetings. On the one hand, the trade union uses the method of organizing socialist emulation to mobilize employees to complete the production tasks stipulated in the contract, and on the other hand, it urges the administration to fulfill the guarantees of employee welfare stipulated in the contract. The implementation of the collective contract is checked every quarter. At the meeting, the factory director makes a report, the trade union committee chairman makes a supplementary report, and workers also speak. Due to the joint efforts of the administration and the trade union, the collective contract has been completed every time.

Thus, from Comrade Komissarov's conversation, it can be seen that in the Honggang Woolen Mill Joint Factory, as in all Soviet industrial enterprises, the administration, the Party, and the trade union are, on the principle of coordination and unity, ensuring the completion of the state's production tasks and the improvement of the material and cultural interests of the employees.

The factory trade union's primary task is to organize and lead socialist emulation. Like all Soviet enterprises, the employees of the Honggang Joint Factory maintain a vigorous enthusiasm for emulation. Ninety-seven percent of the workers and technicians participate in the emulation. The goal of the emulation is not limited to increasing output, but also to paying attention to producing high-quality products, meeting planned varieties, and saving raw materials. The completion of emulation projects in production teams is checked every ten days, and the results are announced promptly. If anyone is found to be lagging behind, the entire team collectively helps them catch up. The emulation results of workshops, production teams, and individuals are summarized once a month. According to the evaluation of the factory trade union committee, the mobile red banner of outstanding achievements is awarded to the most outstanding production department. I saw that the red banner is now in the hands of the weaving factory. The entire joint factory has received the mobile red banner of outstanding achievements from the Ministry of Light Industry in all four quarters of 1952, and in the first quarter of this year, it received the mobile red banner of outstanding achievements from the Council of Ministers and the title of "Excellent Quality Production Enterprise." Currently, more than one hundred production teams in the spinning, weaving, and finishing factories only produce excellent quality products.

In addition to normally organizing and mobilizing, diligently checking, helping the lagging, announcing results, and rewarding the advanced, Comrade Komissarov believes that the most important thing for trade union workers in leading socialist emulation is to cultivate a sense of new things. When he learns about any advanced experience from newspapers or other enterprises, he immediately takes the initiative to obtain the support of the Party organization and the factory management, and mobilizes employees to discuss and promote it, without waiting for orders from above. Not long ago, female workers at the Honggang factory adopted a new initiative from female workers at the Kubaween Fine Wool Mill—to over-fulfill the Five-Year Plan tasks without increasing raw materials. In July, they also absorbed a new initiative from female workers at the Orekhov Cotton Mill—a competition among workers in adjacent occupations to improve product quality, increase labor and equipment productivity, and save raw materials. While making guarantees in terms of output, quality, and savings, weaving female workers challenged winding female workers, perforation female workers, and glue-coating female workers, asking that winding be free of knots and perforation be free of omissions and overlaps. While making their own guarantees, winding female workers challenged spinning female workers, asking that spinning be uniform. They held meetings together and formulated regulations. In this way, workers in all occupations throughout the factory were involved in the emulation craze in a chain-like manner.

Going deep into the workshops, familiarizing oneself with the production situation, and helping workers and administrative cadres solve problems—Comrade Komissarov believes that this is another point that trade union workers should pay attention to in leading socialist emulation. He often goes to the workshops, mostly during the female workers' rest time, and talks to the female workers, caring about their emulation situation. He checks the female workers' emulation regulations in the workshops and provides them with correct opinions. Some female workers also listed "not being late" as an emulation project. He explained to them that this is the labor discipline that everyone must abide by as stipulated by law and should not be used as a condition for emulation. Some female workers were able to complete 105 percent of their task last month, but this month, when entering the emulation, they only guaranteed to complete 104 percent. He persuaded them not to lower their level and should set a target higher than 105 percent. Some female workers could only produce 89 percent of excellent quality products last month, but this month, when entering the emulation, they want to guarantee to produce 93.5 percent of excellent quality products. He advised them not to raise it so high all at once, saying that what they say should be able to be done, and should not become empty talk on paper. Some female workers guaranteed to save raw materials, but did not say how many kilograms of raw materials to save. He taught them that the conditions for emulation should be specific. From this, it can be seen that Comrade Komissarov, like other trade union workers in the Soviet Union, is in favor of formulating emulation projects based on actual possibilities rather than subjective intentions. This pragmatic attitude does not hinder the exploitation of potential production capacity. For example, the Honggang factory administration once calculated that the entire factory could produce 90.6 percent of excellent quality products annually, while the trade union, after exploring potential capacity, guaranteed to produce 91 percent of excellent quality products, and this guarantee has now been reached and exceeded.

Both the Honggang factory administration and the trade union pay attention to mobilizing the creativity and initiative of the masses. The factory has a rationalization proposal and invention office, led by a specialized engineer. This office reports its work to the factory trade union committee every quarter. This office hires technicians to help rationalization proposers with calculations and drafting, and hires heads of various production departments and specialized technicians to regularly receive workers and answer questions. This office regularly points out existing problems in production to workers and attracts everyone's wisdom to solve them. For example, it was once pointed out that transportation work needs to be improved. Later, fitter Belyugin manufactured a small crane. This crane can load and unload 300 kilograms of goods at a time. He also installed a 30-meter automatic conveyor belt in the warehouse. The factory received the task of producing new varieties in the second half of this year and convened a meeting of key workers and Stakhanov workers to mobilize everyone to find ways to complete this task. Foreman Aksonov suggested adding some chemical drugs to the glue for sizing warps to make the quality of the fabric stronger. He also suggested replacing a more durable belt on the loom. Someone suggested cleaning the fabric with carbonic acid to increase the number of excellent quality products. The workers put forward many opinions guaranteeing the production of excellent quality new varieties. Relying on the creativity and initiative of the workers, the Honggang factory maintains a glorious tradition in striving for excellent quality, and now excellent quality products account for 92.5 percent.

The creativity and initiative of the employees are inseparable from their education. According to the factory director, this factory, like other factories in the Soviet Union, has a complete learning network: a five-year branch of the Textile College, a five-year branch of the Secondary Textile Technical School, a night school for young workers, a Stakhanov school, production technology classes, and Party learning organizations. This year, nineteen technicians graduated from the secondary technical school, and forty new students were recruited. The employees are learning without leaving production. The factory trade union pays great attention to educating workers with a communist attitude towards labor. According to Comrade Komissarov, all employees have a high level of political awareness, and the adventurous actions of foreign mercenaries in Berlin and the traitorous and treasonous actions of Beria have aroused the anger of all employees. The workers condemned the war provocateurs and the enemy of the people, Beria, at mass rallies, and at the same time guaranteed to work better. However, the trade union has always unremittingly paid attention to assisting the administration in maintaining labor discipline. According to the director of the weaving factory, when violations of labor discipline occur, a comrade trial meeting is organized to deal with them. In June, a deputy foreman came to work drunk, and another female worker was forty minutes late, and both were handed over to the comrade trial meeting for discussion.

In addition to the production and education of employees, the factory trade union also cares about the employees' living welfare. According to Comrade Komissarov, this work is also multifaceted. The cultural work committee under the factory trade union committee, together with the factory club management office, organizes employees' recreation and cultural activities, organizes singing groups, drama groups, dance groups, soccer groups, water skiing and skiing groups, etc., and the expenses are paid from the factory director's fund. The housing committee under the factory trade union committee is responsible for supervising the construction of houses, etc. Previously, the factory did not have its own children's summer camp. This year, a summer camp was built in the suburbs using the original landlord's manor, spending 400,000 rubles on repairs and 100,000 rubles on equipment. The children are recuperating in two phases, with 175 people able to recuperate in each phase.

In caring about the employees' lives, the Honggang factory trade union workers also grasp the principle of approaching the masses and understanding the needs of the masses. According to Comrade Komissarov, for workers' applications for subsidies due to illness or other reasons, some factories are handled by the factory trade union committee, but the Honggang factory is handled by the workshop trade union committee, which is closer to the employees and knows the employees' situation more specifically. The order in which employees' children are sent to summer camps, kindergartens, and nurseries is decided by a committee composed of employee representatives from each workshop. The factory trade union committee can fairly and reasonably solve many problems by relying on the lower levels and collective leadership in handling workers' living problems, so employees have no complaints beyond their levels.

The factory trade union has its own work plan every month, which is executed after being approved by the factory trade union committee at the beginning of the month. The factory trade union committee meets twice a month to check and summarize socialist emulation or other trade union work, and to listen to the work reports of the workshop trade union committees. The members of each workshop trade union committee also participate in the meetings. The factory has five workshop trade union committees (workshop trade union committees are established at the level of spinning factory, weaving factory, and finishing factory), which meet twice a month, and trade union group leaders, deputy foremen, and other trade union activists also participate in the meetings. The factory has 148 trade union groups, which meet once every ten days to summarize emulation and announce results, and once a month, the results of the factory, workshop, and production team emulations are reported at the trade union group meeting. The factory trade union committee convenes trade union group leaders once a month to exchange work experience, introduce them to new political and production matters, and instruct them on current tasks; it also holds study classes for trade union activists—group leaders, cultural organizers in charge of cultural activities, social inspectors in charge of labor protection, social insurance representatives in charge of health care, etc.—and invites Party committee secretaries, trade union chairmen, and others to give lectures. The meetings held by trade union organizations at all levels last two to two and a half hours each time, discuss one issue each time, and have ten to fifteen people speaking each time, with each person speaking for ten minutes. Ninety-nine percent of the factory's employees have joined the trade union.

In this way, the Honggang Woolen Mill Joint Factory Trade Union Committee, under the leadership of the Party Committee and in close coordination with the factory management, relies on trade union activists and all employees to carry out the leadership of socialist emulation and other trade union work.

    红岗毛织联合工厂工会主席访问记
    本报驻莫斯科特派记者  李何
    最近接连两次访问了莫斯科红岗毛织联合工厂：一次访问工厂工会主席，另一次和车间主任、领班谈了话。
    红岗毛织联合工厂是苏联出产优等产品运动的发源地。这个运动的发起人朱特基赫当时就是这个工厂的副领班。工厂已经有九十四年历史，厂房和机器差不多都是旧的，但是由于全体职工的努力，它仍站在苏联纺织企业的前列。我走过了各个车间。厂房虽然旧，但是干净、光线充足、温度也调节得不闷人；机器虽然旧，但是都充分地被使用着，并且附有安全装置，三年来没有发生受伤事故。有一个厂已经完全换上新式织布机，女工们勤快而安静地工作着。
    厂长伯列文同志、党委员会书记别里雅也夫同志陪同我们参观。据厂长谈：红岗毛织联合工厂好几年来一直注意产品的质量，在一九五三年第一季得到了出产优等产品的工厂的称号。全体职工从年初以来已超额多产了三十七万公尺毛布，增加品种的任务也超过计划地完成着。工厂在改建中。到五年计划末，每年将比现在多产三、四百万公尺毛布。
    当我们在工厂党委办公室会见工厂工会主席柯米沙罗夫同志的时候，他刚送罢职工的儿童到夏令营回来。柯米沙罗夫同志是一个很老的工会工作者。他在一九二六年就开始做工会工作，当了工会小组长、车间工会主席，在一九二八年当了工厂工会主席，从一九三八年起当了十年州工会主席，后来自己愿意回到工厂当领班，从一九四八年起又被选为工厂工会主席。在谈话中，我发觉他属于“多做事、少说话”一类型的人物。但是他还是不倦地回答了我所提出的接二连三的问题。
    红岗联合工厂的工会委员会受莫斯科州工会委员会和轻工业与食品工业工会中央委员会的领导。红岗厂是比较大的企业，工厂工会委员会也经常直接从苏联职工会中央理事会那里得到如像推广新的创举之类的指示。工厂工会委员会向州工会委员会报告工作，在必要时也写信给轻工业与食品工业工会中央委员会。日常直接领导工厂工会委员会的是工厂党委员会。
    工厂工会委员会受工厂党委员会的领导和监督。党组织通过工会来领导社会主义竞赛。党委员会经常给工会委员会以方针的指示。工厂工会委员会开会时，党委书记每次都参加，有时副书记也参加。他们指出工会工作的方向，提醒要注意的问题。有些事情，工会找行政仍不能解决的，取得党组织的帮助便解决了。工会委员会每年两次在工厂党委员会上报告工会的全盘工作。在报告之前两三个星期，组织十五到十八个人的检查委员会，由一个党委会委员领导，吸收党员和非党员的工人参加，检查工厂工会委员会和车间工会委员会的工作。检查委员会在工厂工会主席向党委员会作报告后，提出自己的意见。所以工厂中党的工作和工会的工作是密切却又不相代替的。例如：工厂在不久前举行了关于质量问题的代表会议，会议的日程、讨论的问题等准备工作，由工会委员会负责的；会议准备的情形和会议的决定，由党委员会审查。又如：工厂的宣传员是在党组织的领导下工作的，宣传员们根据党组织指示的题目和内容向工人宣传（读报、座谈等），工会负责组织工人参加，宣传的质量又由党组织来检查。
    工会在各方面协助行政。厂长和工厂工会委员会保持着密切的关系。工厂实行一长负责制，但厂长除了上级来的遵照执行的指令以外，一般事情都找工会主席商量。由厂长单独决定了的事情，也通知工会。每逢工业部的总管理局下来了生产计划，厂长就和工会主席一起研究怎样保证完成它，然后拿到职工中去讨论。不久前要开关于质量问题的代表会议，行政和工会一起决定了由谁作报告、草拟决议等等事情。厂长基金的用途，也征询工会的意见。今年工厂工会发给了职工一百五十张休养券，此外动用厂长基金补充了一百张休养券。今年已经从厂长基金中拨了十万卢布购买休养券和津贴那些需要物质帮助的工人，拨了二十万卢布修理工人的住宅。夏天要把工厂的幼儿园和托儿所迁移到凉爽的郊外去。迁移工作单靠行政是做不了的，工会动员儿童的家长协助完成了。行政和工会之间每年签订集体合同，集体合同草案先在工人会议上讨论。工会一方面用组织社会主义竞赛办法动员职工完成合同上规定的生产任务，另一方面督促行政履行合同上规定的对职工福利的保证。每季检查集体合同执行的情形，在会议上，厂长作报告，工会委员会主席作副报告，工人也发言。由于行政和工会双方的努力，集体合同每次都完成了。
    这样，从柯米沙罗夫同志的谈话中，可以看出：在红岗毛织联合工厂，和在苏联一切工业企业一样，行政、党、工会三方面，是在协调一致的原则上，保证国家生产任务的完成和职工物质和文化利益的提高的。
    工厂工会的首要工作是组织和领导社会主义竞赛。和苏联所有企业一样，红岗联合工厂职工保持着旺盛的竞赛热情。百分之九十七的工人和技术人员参加竞赛。竞赛的目标不限于增加产量，同时注意出产优等产品、合乎计划的品种和节约原料。每十天检查一次竞赛项目在生产组内完成的情形，及时公布结果。发现什么人落后了，全组就集体地帮助她，使她赶上大家。每月总结一次车间、生产组和个人的竞赛成绩。根据工厂工会委员会的评判，把全厂的流动优胜红旗授给最优秀的生产部门。我看到红旗现在织布厂手里。整个联合工厂在一九五二年四个季度都得到了轻工业部的流动优胜红旗，今年第一季得到部长会议的流动优胜红旗和生产优等质量的企业的称号。现在纺纱、织布、整理三厂有一百多生产组只出产优等质量产品。
    除了正常地组织发动，勤快检查，帮助落后，公布成绩，奖励先进以外，工会工作者在领导社会主义竞赛方面，柯米沙罗夫同志认为，最重要的是培养对于新鲜事物的感觉。他从报纸或别的企业知道什么先进经验时，立刻主动地取得党组织和厂部的支持，发动职工讨论和推广，不等待上级的命令。红岗厂女工不久前采纳了库巴维因细呢工厂女工的新创举——不增加原料材料而超额地完成五年计划任务的竞赛，七月间又吸收了奥列霍夫棉织厂女工的新发起——毗邻职业的工人之间争取改进产品质量、提高劳动和设备的生产率、节约原料和材料的竞赛。织布女工在产量、质量、节约各方面提出保证的同时，向卷线女工、穿孔女工、涂胶水女工挑战，要求卷线不结疙瘩，要求穿孔不漏不重。卷线女工在作出自己保证的同时，向纺线女工挑战，要求纺纱要均匀。一起开会，订出规约。这样，全工厂各个职业的工人都连环地投入竞赛热潮中。
    深入车间去，熟悉生产情况，帮助工人和行政干部解决问题，——柯米沙罗夫同志认为，这是工会工作者在领导社会主义竞赛中另一个注意点。他经常到车间去，多半在女工休息时间，和女工们谈话，关心她们竞赛的情形。他在车间检查女工们的竞赛规约，向她们提供正确的意见。有的女工把“不迟到”也列为竞赛项目。他向她们解释，这是法律规定的人人要遵守的劳动纪律，不应作为竞赛的条件。有的女工上个月已经能完成任务百分之一百零五，这个月进入竞赛时只保证完成百分之一百零四。他说服她们不要降低自己的水平，应该订得高于百分之一百零五。有的女工上月只能出产优等产品百分之八十九，这个月进入竞赛时却要保证出产优等产品百分之九十三点五。他劝她们不要一下子提得那么高，说到的要能做到，不要变成纸上空谈。有的女工保证节约原料，但没有说节约多少公斤原料。他教导她们订竞赛条件要具体。从这里可以看到，柯米沙罗夫同志和苏联其他工会工作者一样，是赞成根据实际的可能性而不是根据主观意图来制订竞赛项目的。这种实事求是的态度并不妨碍对生产潜在能力的发掘。例如，红岗工厂行政上曾经计算出全厂每年可以出产优等产品百分之九十点六，而工会经过发掘潜在能力保证出产优等产品百分之九十一，现在这个保证已经达到和超过了。
    红岗工厂行政和工会都注意发动群众的创造性和积极性。工厂有合理化建议和发明处，由专门的工程师领导。这个处每季向工厂工会委员会报告工作。这个处聘请技术人员帮助合理化建议者计算和制图，聘请各生产部门负责人、专门技术人员定期接待工人、解答疑难。这个处定期向工人指出生产中现存的问题，吸引大家的智慧来解决它。例如，曾经指出运输工作要改善。后来钳工别留庚制造了小型的起重机。这个起重机一次能装卸三百公斤货物。他还在仓库安装了三十公尺自动输送带。工厂得到了在今年后半年出产新的品种的任务，召集了骨干工人和斯大哈诺夫工作者的会议，发动大家想办法完成这个任务。领班阿克松诺夫建议，在浆经线的胶中添一些化学药品，使布的质量更加结实。他还建议在织布机上换上一种更结实的皮带。有人建议用炭酸弄干净布料，以增加优等产品。工人们提出了许多保证出产优等的新品种的意见。依靠工人群众的创造性和积极性，红岗工厂在争取优等质量方面保持着光荣的传统，现在优等产品占百分之九十二点五。
    职工的创造性、积极性和他们所受的教育是分不开的。据厂长谈：这个工厂和苏联其他工厂一样，有整套学习网：五年制的纺织学院分院、五年制的中等纺织技术学校分校、青工夜校、斯大哈诺夫学校、生产技术班和党的学习组织。今年从中等技术学校毕业了十九位技师，又招收了四十个新生。职工们不脱离生产地学习着。工厂工会很注意以共产主义劳动态度教育工人。据柯米沙罗夫同志谈，全体职工政治觉悟很高，外国雇佣分子在柏林的冒险行为和贝利亚的叛党叛国的行为，都引起了全体职工的愤怒。工人们在群众大会上谴责了战争挑拨者和人民死敌贝利亚，同时保证更好地劳动。但是工会始终不懈地注意协助行政上保持劳动纪律。据织布厂主任谈，遇有违反劳动纪律的事情发生时，便组织同志审判会来处理。六月间有一个副领班喝醉了酒来工作，另一个女工迟到了四十分钟，都交到同志审判会去讨论。
    工厂工会除了职工的生产和教育以外，也关心职工的生活福利。据柯米沙罗夫同志谈，这工作也是多方面的。工厂工会委员会下面的文化工作委员会，和工厂俱乐部管理处一起，组织职工的休息和文娱活动，组织了歌咏组、戏剧组、舞蹈组、足球组、滑水滑雪组等等，费用由厂长基金中支出。工厂工会委员会下面的住宅委员会，负责督促房屋的修建等等。以前工厂没有自己的儿童夏令营，今年在郊外利用原先地主的庄院修建了一座夏令营，花了四十万卢布修理费和十万卢布设备费。儿童分两期休养，每期可以休养一百七十五人。
    在关心职工的生活方面，红岗工厂工会工作者也掌握着接近群众和了解群众的需要这个原则。据柯米沙罗夫同志谈：对于因病或别的原因需要给予补助金的工人的申请书，有些工厂是由工厂工会委员会处理的，但红岗工厂由车间工会委员会处理，这样更接近职工，更具体知道职工情况。职工的孩子送夏令营、幼儿园、托儿所的先后，是由各车间职工代表组成的委员会决定的。工厂工会委员会对于处理工人生活问题，由于依靠下层和集体领导，能够公正合理地解决许多问题，所以职工没有越级申诉的。
    工厂工会每月有自己工作计划，月初由工厂工会委员会通过后执行。工厂工会委员会每月开会两次，检查和总结社会主义竞赛或其他工会工作，听取车间工会委员会的工作报告，各车间工会委员会委员也参加会议。工厂有五个车间工会委员会（纺纱厂、织布厂、整理厂一级建立车间工会委员会），每月开会两次，工会小组长、副领班等工会积极分子也参加会议。工厂有一百四十八个工会小组，每十天开会一次总结竞赛和公布成绩，每月在工会小组会上通报厂、车间、生产组竞赛的结果。工厂工会委员会每月一次召集工会小组长，交换工作经验，向他们介绍政治和生产上的新鲜事物和指示当前任务；还为工会积极分子——小组长、负责文娱活动的文化组织员、负责劳动保护的社会检查员、负责保健等等的社会保险代表——举办研究班，聘请党委书记、工会主席等讲演。各级工会组织举行的会议，每次两个到两个半钟点，每次讨论一个问题，每次有十个到十五个人发言，每个人发言十分钟。工厂职工百分之九十九加入了工会。
    红岗毛织联合工厂工会委员会就是这样在党委员会的领导下，和厂部的协同一致的行动中，依靠工会积极分子和全体职工，进行着领导社会主义竞赛和其他工会工作的。
