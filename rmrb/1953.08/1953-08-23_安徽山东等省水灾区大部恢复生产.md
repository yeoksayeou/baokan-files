Since late June, continuous heavy rains in Anhui, Hubei, Shandong, Henan and other provinces have caused mountain torrents and the breaching and overflowing of inland river tributaries in some areas, resulting in waterlogging disasters.

After the disaster occurred, the local Party and government leading organs issued emergency instructions and sent responsible personnel to lead a large number of cadres to the disaster areas to actively lead the masses in rushing to repair breaches and drain water to save seedlings. Wuhu Prefecture mobilized 467,400 laborers and organized 100,579 waterwheels and 41 water pumps to drain water day and night. Within half a month, 1.45 million mu of paddy fields were saved, accounting for more than 60 percent of the waterlogged area. In Lingbi County, Su County Prefecture, more than 50,000 laborers were mobilized to dig 156 ditches and build 8 dikes, and the accumulated water from more than 570,000 mu of fields has been completely drained. Now, various places are carrying out production work such as washing seedlings, supporting seedlings, and rushing to plant and replant. When heavy rain and floods began to rise in Huanggang Prefecture, Hubei, the county and district cadres were urgently mobilized to brave the rain and go to the dikes for rescue. After the disaster occurred, the provincial government sent responsible cadres to cooperate with comrades from the central and south China disaster area working groups to visit and resettle the disaster victims in the disaster area, and to supervise the rescue work. In order to support the production of disaster victims, the provincial government has allocated 3.1 billion yuan for relief funds and 3 billion yuan for loans. Through a combination of rescue, drainage, and replanting measures, as well as the distribution of relief grain, funds, and loans, the morale of the masses has gradually stabilized, and production has been initially restored. Laiyang Prefectural Committee and Commissioner's Office in Shandong Province have successively organized two groups of cadres to Yexian and Yexinan disaster areas to assist in rescue and drainage, and to visit and resettle disaster victims. Yexian County suspended the three-level cadre meeting due to the disaster, and the county party committee, county magistrate, and other responsible personnel led more than 150 cadres to the disaster area for rescue. Yexinan County-level organs, except for a very small number of cadres who remained to maintain daily work, were all put into the rescue work of the flood. The fields that have been drained have been replanted and converted into late autumn crops in a timely manner. As of the end of July, the province has rescued, drained, replanted and converted more than 4 million mu of fields. In order to rescue the flood, the Shandong Provincial People's Government has allocated 12 billion yuan for disaster relief to help farmers in the disaster areas to help themselves through production. After the heavy rain, six counties in Shangqiu Prefecture, Henan Province, organized 790 cadres, led by the county party committee secretaries and county magistrates, to go deep into the disaster areas to express their condolences and lead the drainage. Within five days, 135 ditches were dug, saving 346,300,000 mu of autumn fields. The province has drained 1,189,800 mu of waterlogged land. Yanshi County put forward the slogan "Rescue the flooded, support the fallen, replenish the missing seedlings, and dig out the buried," which enhanced the masses' confidence in saving seedlings and protecting autumn crops.

    安徽山东等省水灾区大部恢复生产
    六月下旬以来，安徽、湖北、山东、河南等省连降大雨，部分地区山洪暴发和内河支流溃决漫溢造成了水涝灾害。
    灾情发生后，当地党政领导机关均发出了紧急指示，并派出负责人员带领大批干部赶赴灾区积极领导群众抢险堵口，排水救苗。芜湖专区动员了民工四十六万七千四百余人，组织水车十万零五百七十九辆，抽水机四十一部，日夜排水，在半月内，救出一百四十五万亩稻田，占受涝田亩的百分之六十以上。宿县专区灵璧县经动员民工五万余人，挖沟一百五十六条、筑堤八个，已把五十七万余亩田的积水全部排出，现各地正进行洗苗扶苗抢种补种的生产工作。湖北黄岗专区在大雨滂沱洪水开始上涨时，即紧急动员县区干部冒雨上堤进行抢救，灾情发生后，省府又派负责干部协同中央、中南灾区工作组同志，赴灾区慰问安置灾民，督导抢救工作。为支持灾民生产，省府先后拨救济款三十一亿元，贷款三十亿元。经过抢救、排水、补种等措施结合发放救济粮款及贷款，群众情绪渐趋安定，生产已初步恢复。山东莱阳地委及专署先后组织两批干部到掖县、掖南灾区协助抢救排水，慰问和安置灾民。掖县因灾停止了三级干部会议，由县委、县长等负责人员带领一百五十余个干部赴灾区抢救，掖南县级机关，除留极少干部坚持日常工作外，全部投入水灾的抢救工作，排出积水的田均已及时补种与改种了晚秋作物。截至七月底止，全省已抢救排水补种改种的田达四百余万亩。为了抢救水灾，山东省人民政府已拨救灾款一百二十亿元，帮助灾区农民生产自救。河南省商邱专区六个县在大雨后即组织了七百九十个干部，由县委书记县长亲自率领深入灾区慰问，并领导排水，五天内即挖沟一百三十五条，救出三十四万六千三百余万亩秋田，全省已排出积水地一百一十八万九千八百余亩。偃师县提出“淹了的救出来，倒了的扶起来，缺苗的补起来，埋住的扒出来”的口号，增强了群众救苗保秋的信心。     （徐力元）
