Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 23rd (TASS dispatch)

From August 20th to 22nd, talks were held in Moscow between the Soviet Government and the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic.

The Soviet side participating in the talks included: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, G.M. Malenkov; First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, V.M. Molotov; Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, N.S. Khrushchev; First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and Minister of Defense of the USSR, N.A. Bulganin; First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, L.M. Kaganovich; Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and Minister of Domestic and Foreign Trade of the USSR, A.I. Mikoyan; Chairman of the State Planning Committee of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, M.Z. Saburov; Minister of Finance of the USSR, A.G. Zverev; Soviet High Commissioner in Germany, Ambassador V.S. Semyonov.

The German Democratic Republic side participating in the talks included: Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl; Deputy Prime Minister Walter Ulbricht; Deputy Prime Minister Otto Nuschke; Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Construction, Dr. Lothar Bolz; Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Dr. Hans Loch; Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Hans Reichelt; Minister of Foreign and Domestic Trade, Kurt Gregor; Minister of Metallurgical and Mining Industries, Fritz Selbmann; Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Bruno Leuschner; Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic in Moscow, Rudolf Appelt; Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, Herbert Warnke; Chairman of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany, Professor E. Correns; Chairman of the Central Council of the Free German Youth League, Erich Honecker; Representative of the Democratic Women's League of Germany, Ilse Thiele; Official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, Peter Florin.

In the course of the talks, important issues concerning the development of relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, as well as pressing issues in the entire German question, were discussed.

The talks took place in an atmosphere of friendship, mutual understanding, and sincerity.

Eight years have passed since the end of the war in Europe, and Germany still does not have a peace treaty, remains divided into eastern and western parts, and is in an unequal position in its relations with other countries. Both sides reached full agreement that this abnormal situation must be eliminated. Therefore, a peace conference must be convened in the near future, and representatives of Germany must participate in all stages of preparation for the peace treaty and in the peace conference. In order to restore the national unity of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy, a provisional all-German government must be established through direct agreement between East and West Germany. The main task of this government is to prepare for and hold free all-German elections. After the elections, the German people themselves will, without foreign interference, resolve the issues of the social and national structure of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic welcomed with satisfaction and gratitude the statement of the Soviet government on reducing the financial and economic obligations borne by Germany as a result of the war.

In the course of the talks, taking into account the conscientious fulfillment by the German Democratic Republic of its obligations to the Soviet Union in the past few years, and the fact that, thanks to the efforts of the democratic forces of Germany, the German Democratic Republic has become an important factor in the struggle for peace in Europe, the two sides reached agreement on the implementation of a number of political and economic measures aimed at helping the further development of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic and improving the welfare of its people.

The decisions of the Soviet government stipulate that:

    From January 1, 1954, the German Democratic Republic will cease to pay reparations;

    Soviet enterprises in Germany will be transferred to the German Democratic Republic free of charge;

    The expenses paid by the German Democratic Republic for the stationing of Soviet troops on the territory of the German Democratic Republic will be reduced to no more than five percent of the national budget revenue of the German Democratic Republic;

    The German Democratic Republic will be relieved of the obligation to repay debts for occupation fees owed in foreign currency since 1945;

    Germany will be relieved of the obligation to repay post-war national debt to the Soviet Union.

Regarding the agreements reached in this regard, the two sides signed a protocol, the original text of which is published later.

In the course of the talks, agreements were also reached on a number of other issues related to strengthening and developing economic, cultural, scientific, and technical cooperation between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.

The two countries agreed that, in addition to existing trade agreements, the Soviet Union will sell goods worth 590 million rubles to the German Democratic Republic in 1953, including grain, coal, rolled non-ferrous metals, copper, lead, aluminum, cotton, and other goods.

The Soviet government granted the German Democratic Republic a loan of 485 million rubles, including 135 million rubles in freely convertible currency. This loan bears an annual interest rate of two percent and will be repaid in two years starting in 1955.

At the request of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, the two sides reached the following agreement: Measures will be taken to systematically discontinue the serving of sentences by German prisoners of war convicted of crimes during the war, except for those prisoners of war who have committed particularly serious crimes against peace and humanity, who will continue to serve their sentences.

In order to strengthen and further develop the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic—which is a guarantee of the German people's struggle to establish a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany—the two sides agreed to upgrade the Soviet diplomatic mission in Berlin and the diplomatic mission of the German Democratic Republic in Moscow to embassies, and to exchange ambassadors.

    德意志民主共和国政府代表团以满意和感激的心情欢迎苏联政府关于减轻德国由于战争的后果而担负的财政与经济义务的声明。
    在会谈过程中，由于考虑到德意志民主共和国在过去几年中不苟地履行了它对苏联的义务，以及由于德国民主力量的努力，德意志民主共和国在争取欧洲和平的斗争中成了一个重要的因素，双方在有关执行一些政治与经济措施的问题上达成了协议，这些措施目的在于帮助德意志民主共和国国民经济的进一步发展，并增进它的人民的福利。
    苏联政府的决定规定：
    自一九五四年一月一日开始，德意志民主共和国停止支付赔偿费；
    无偿地把在德国的苏联企业移交给德意志民主共和国；
    把德意志民主共和国因苏联军队驻扎在德意志民主共和国领土上而支付的费用减少到不超过德意志民主共和国国家预算收入的百分之五；
    解除德意志民主共和国偿付自一九四五年以来所积欠的以外币支付的占领费债务；
    解除德国偿付战后对苏联所欠国债的义务。
    关于在这方面达成的协议，双方签订了一个议定书，议定书原文发表在后。
    在会谈过程中，还在一些其它有关加强与发展苏联与德意志民主共和国之间的经济、文化、科学与技术合作的问题上达成了协议。

    由于德意志民主共和国政府代表团的要求，双方达成了以下协议：将采取措施，有次序地使因在战争期间犯有罪行而被判罪的德国战俘不再继续服刑，不过那些对和平及人类犯有特别严重罪行的战俘除外，他们将继续服刑。
    为了加强并进一步发展苏联与德意志民主共和国之间的友好关系——这是德国人民争取建立一个统一、爱好和平与民主的德国的斗争的保障，双方同意将苏联驻柏林的外交使团以及德意志民主共和国驻莫斯科的外交使团升为大使馆，并互派大使。
