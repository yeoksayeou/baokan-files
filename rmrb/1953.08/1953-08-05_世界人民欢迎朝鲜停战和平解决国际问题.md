World People Welcome the Korean Armistice and Peaceful Resolution of International Issues

All-India Peace Council Celebrates Korean Armistice

The All-India Peace Council held a general meeting at the Constitution Club in New Delhi on July 31 to celebrate the Korean armistice.

At the beginning of the meeting, Mrs. Nehru lit an eight-cornered lamp according to Indian custom, expressing her celebration of this happy event. On behalf of the meeting, she assured that she would continue to make the greatest efforts to ensure that the armistice agreement signed in Korea achieves a final and appropriate result.

Gopalan, the leader of the Communist members of the Indian Parliament, said: "All peace-loving people around the world are delighted by the Korean armistice brought about by the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement." He said: "All glory belongs to the heroic defenders of Korea, the brave Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers." He warned that US imperialism is already trying to find excuses to undermine the armistice. He called for redoubled efforts to ensure peace.

Dr. Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, said: "In Korea, on one side were ordinary farmers, simple people and patriots, and on the other side were weapons of war, destruction and devastation. The heroic Chinese People's Volunteers came to help the Korean people. They could not be intimidated and could not be defeated. So the United States and all the other countries fighting them had to sign an armistice agreement. Most importantly, this is a great moral victory."

The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution expressing its joy at the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement and expressing its belief that the Korean Armistice Agreement could become the starting point for resolving all other international disputes and ensuring a complete easing of international tensions. The resolution expressed concern that Syngman Rhee and others were still threatening to undermine the armistice, and demanded that they be stopped immediately and that all obstacles to peace be removed. The resolution pointed out that the Korean people face the arduous task of reviving and building their lives, and expressed its belief that the Korean people would accomplish their work with the same determination and indomitable spirit they displayed when resisting the aggressors. The resolution assured that the Indian people will give full support and sympathy to the Korean people's future struggles.

Ceylon Peace Committee Welcomes Korean Armistice Agreement

The Ceylon National Peace Committee issued a statement welcoming the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Committee stated that it hoped that the cessation of hostilities would not only promote lasting peace in Korea, but also strengthen world peace. The statement said that the cessation of the Korean War proves that all disputes can and must be resolved through peaceful negotiation.

All-Australian Peace Congress Preparatory Committee Issues Statement

According to the Australian "Tribune" newspaper, the Australian National Peace Congress will be held in Sydney at the end of September. The conference will discuss issues of peace and war.

The All-Australian Peace Congress Preparatory Committee, established in late July, issued a statement saying that Australian peace advocates advocate resolving differences and ensuring peaceful relations through consultation. The statement pointed out that at the upcoming conference, "an opinion demanding peace will be formed to influence the policies of the Australian government."

The "Sydney Morning Herald" wrote, in referring to the upcoming conference: The Korean armistice proves that differences between countries can be resolved through patient discussion and negotiation. Therefore, the Korean armistice has aroused new hope in the hearts of millions of ordinary people.

Egyptian Newspapers Criticize US War Policy

The "Egyptian Masses" newspaper published an editorial entitled "The Failure of War Policy," saying that the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement meant "the complete failure of war policy and the glorious victory of peace policy." The newspaper pointed out, with regard to the Western countries' continued attempts to drag Egypt into the so-called "common defense" system, that the war launched by the imperialists in Korea clearly tells the people of all countries what this "common defense" will bring to the world. The newspaper wrote that "common defense" means to the people "to turn their countries into ruins and to cause huge losses in manpower and material resources. From the example of Korea, we can see what disasters and consequences 'common defense' will bring to the people of those countries under its iron claws."

Brazil to Hold National People's Vote

According to the Brazilian newspaper "People's Daily," the Brazilian Committee for the Defense of Peace held a meeting in Rio de Janeiro to discuss the resolutions passed by the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting and measures to carry out a campaign for negotiation in Brazil. The meeting decided to hold a national people's vote on the campaign for negotiation from September 1 to October 15 this year, and to convene the Fourth Brazilian National Peace Congress in late October this year. The appeal to the Brazilian people adopted at the meeting stated: The Brazilian peace movement supports the campaign for negotiation launched by the World Peace Council.

    世界人民欢迎朝鲜停战和平解决国际问题
    全印和平理事会庆祝朝鲜停战
    全印和平理事会于七月三十一日在新德里宪法俱乐部举行大会，庆祝朝鲜停战。
    大会开始时，尼赫鲁夫人按照印度习俗，点起八角灯，表示庆祝这件喜事。她代表大会保证：将继续尽最大的努力，使在朝鲜签订的停战协定达到最终的、适当的结果。
    印度国会中的共产党议员领袖高普兰说：“全世界爱好和平的人民都为朝鲜停战协定的签订所带来的朝鲜停战感到欢欣。”他说：“一切光荣属于朝鲜的英勇保卫者，勇敢的朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军。”他警告说：美帝国主义已经在设法寻找藉口来破坏停战。他号召加倍努力来确保和平。
    全印和平理事会主席克其鲁博士说：“在朝鲜，一边是普通农民、纯朴的人民和爱国者，在另一边，全是战争、毁灭和破坏的武器。英勇的中国人民志愿军来帮助朝鲜人民了。他们是吓不倒的，是不能被击败的。于是与他们作战的美国和所有其他国家不得不签订停战协定了。最重要的是：这是一个伟大的道义的胜利。”
    大会一致通过决议，表示对于朝鲜停战协定签订的欢欣，并表示相信朝鲜停战协定能成为解决所有其他国际争执、保证国际紧张局势完全趋于缓和的起点。决议对于李承晚和其他人仍然扬言要破坏停战表示不安，并要求立刻制止他们，而且消除和平道路上的一切障碍。决议指出朝鲜人民面对着复兴和建设生活的艰巨工作，并相信朝鲜人民会以他们在反抗侵略者的时候所表现的同样的决心和不屈不挠的精神来完成他们的工作。决议保证印度人民对朝鲜人民今后的斗争将予以充分的支持和同情。
    锡兰和委会欢迎朝鲜停战协定
    锡兰全国和平委员会发表声明，欢迎朝鲜停战协定的签订。委员会表示，它希望敌对行为的停止不仅将促成朝鲜的持久和平，而且将加强世界和平。声明说，朝鲜战争的停止，证明所有争执都能够而且必须用和平协商方式来解决。
    全澳和平大会筹委会发表声明
    据澳大利亚“论坛报”报道：澳大利亚全国和平大会将于九月底在悉尼举行。大会将讨论和平与战争的问题。
    七月下旬成立的全澳和平大会筹备委员会发表声明说：澳大利亚的和平拥护者主张以协商办法解决分歧和保证和平关系。声明指出，在将要举行的大会上，“将要形成一种要求和平的舆论，以影响澳大利亚政府的政策。”
    “悉尼先锋晨报”在谈到即将举行的大会时写道：朝鲜停战证明，通过耐心的讨论和协商可以解决各国之间的分歧。因此，朝鲜停战在千百万普通人民的心中激起了新的希望。
    埃及报纸抨击美国战争政策
    “埃及群众报”发表题为“战争政策的失败”的社论说，朝鲜停战协定的签订意味着“战争政策的完全失败与和平政策的光辉胜利”。报纸就西方国家仍在企图把埃及拖进所谓“共同防御”体系一事指出，帝国主义者在朝鲜发动的战争，明显地告诉各国人民这种“共同防御”带给世界的将是什么。报纸写道，“共同防御”对于人民来说，就是意味着“使他们的国家沦为废墟和使人力物力遭到巨大损失。从朝鲜的例子我们可以看出，‘共同防御’会给它的铁爪下的那些国家的人民带来怎样的灾难和后果。”
    巴西将举行全国人民投票
    据巴西报纸“人民报”报道：巴西保卫和平委员会在里约热内卢举行会议，讨论世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议所通过的决议和关于在巴西开展争取协商运动的措施。会议决定从今年九月一日起到十月十五日止，举行一个关于争取协商运动的全国人民投票，并在今年十月下旬召开巴西第四届全国和平大会。会议通过的告巴西人民书说：巴西和平运动支持世界和平理事会发起的争取协商运动。    （据新华社讯）
