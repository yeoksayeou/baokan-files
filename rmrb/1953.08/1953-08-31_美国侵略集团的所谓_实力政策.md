    The So-Called "Policy of Strength" of the American Aggression Group
    Zhang Fang
    In his speech at the closing session of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Comrade Malenkov solemnly pointed out: "The whole world knows that aggressive forces cannot turn the wheel of history backwards. Those who want to pursue a clear-headed policy in international affairs should base it on reality, on facts, whether they like it or not." This is a timely sobering reminder to some groups in the United States who oppose the relaxation of international tensions, because they still openly advocate a so-called "policy of strength" towards the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world.
    What exactly is the so-called "policy of strength" of the American aggression group? To put it bluntly, it is a policy of the United States attempting to achieve world hegemony, a policy of war. Its spearhead is directed at the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, while its actual content is to enslave and plunder other capitalist countries. Its characteristic is to create international disputes, increase international tensions, incite war hysteria, and even ultimately launch a new world war.
    Although World War II ended with results unfavorable to the world capitalist system, American monopoly capital made a fortune through the war. The American monopolists saw that Germany, Japan, and Italy, the three major capitalist powers, were defeated, and that Britain and France had also lost their former positions. They also mistakenly estimated that the Soviet Union, the bulwark of world peace, would not be able to recover quickly from the wounds of war. Therefore, they arrogantly believed that they were the only ones supreme in the world, harboring ambitions to dominate the world. According to Karl Marzani, who worked in the "American Strategic Services Bureau" and other American intelligence agencies during the war, when the atomic bomb test achieved final success in July and August 1945, the American "Cold War" policy was formally formed. "Atomic diplomacy" or "atomic blackmail" became synonymous with American diplomacy thereafter. After the war, Truman clamored that "the United States should lead the world," which was actually based on the "strength" of the atomic bomb as the basis for his war clamor.
    By 1947, the American aggression group further announced the "theory" and specific practices of its "policy of strength." In July of that year, Kennan, a "strategist" of the U.S. Department of State and a notorious anti-Soviet "expert," used the pseudonym "Mr. X" to write an article in an American magazine, openly proposing a so-called policy of "containing communism." He declared that the United States should adopt a "firm and unwavering policy of containment, aimed at using an unshakable force of resistance" to "resist the Russians." The starting point of this policy was the assumption of "internal weakness and instability of the Soviet state." The specific practice to realize this policy was to unite a group of vassal states under the command of the United States around the Soviet Union, forming an "alliance" to become an "impregnable barrier" to "contain communism." According to Lippmann, a Wall Street spokesperson and American journalist, Kennan's article showed that "the State Department has made the decision to announce to the American people, to the world, and naturally to the Kremlin, the estimates, considerations, and conclusions on which the State Department based its plans."
    Since then, the United States has taken various measures of foreign aggression, such as organizing the North Atlantic Aggression Group, implementing the Marshall Plan to enslave the people of Western European countries, reviving militarism in West Germany and Japan, and establishing military bases around the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, etc.
    However, reality was not so wonderful for the planners of this "containment policy." Because the "strength" basis of this "containment policy," in addition to the "strength" of the United States, also required a reactionary alliance under the command of the United States. This naturally required the United States to have the power to command in this alliance. Therefore, although the spearhead of the "containment policy" was directed at the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, the actual implementation process was first of all a process of the United States carrying out harsh enslavement and plunder of a series of capitalist countries, especially "old" capitalist countries, such as Britain, France, and their colonies. In this way, the American aggression group became the center of aggression and plunder within the capitalist world, and thus also became the center of hatred for the people of all countries. The U.S. policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, occupying military bases everywhere, and forcing the countries under its command to expand their armies and prepare for war has not only been met with increasingly strong opposition from the people of all countries, but has also plunged its vassals and allies into political chaos and economic damage. Therefore, the American "containment policy" has not only failed to strengthen the "strength" of it and its allies, but has weakened this "strength." Conversely, the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has become even stronger and has become the pillar of world peace. The pace of historical progress has not been hindered by the American "containment policy."
    However, the American aggression group is not only unwilling to admit the failure of the "containment policy," but it has also gone a step further from the "containment policy" and launched the war of aggression against Korea. It hopes to use the war hysteria of anti-peace forces incited by the Korean War to appease the dissatisfaction and resistance of various countries in the capitalist world towards American policy; and to use the Korean War to further promote the transformation of the economies of various capitalist countries towards the war track, so that the economies of the United States and other capitalist countries may be able to temporarily maintain a false prosperity to alleviate the economic crisis of the capitalist world. That is to say, the American aggression group wants to implement its "policy of strength" in Korea to save its politically and economically bankrupt crisis. But the result was completely the opposite. The United States suffered a serious military defeat in Korea and had to accept the armistice. At the same time, in the process of organizing and inciting the Korean War, it not only did not abandon, but strengthened its policy of issuing orders in the capitalist world, which further aroused the resistance of the people of various countries to American policy. Even the ruling classes of some capitalist countries, in order to maintain their own economic competitive power against the United States, and in order to maintain their ruling position at home, have had to express their disagreement or even opposition to this so-called "policy of strength" of the United States to a certain extent under the strong pressure of the people.
    The continuous failure of the American "policy of strength" further proves that negotiation, not force, is the only way to resolve international disputes. Those who support this path and are willing to move along this path are becoming more and more widespread. This makes the supporters of the peace policies of the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies spread all over the world, which makes the wave of the world people's peace movement even more magnificent. Therefore, the possibility of further easing the international situation has increased even more.
    However, the planners of the American "policy of strength" are not willing to admit the realistic development of the international situation because of this. On the contrary, they continue to mistakenly believe that the peaceful measures of the Soviet Union are a manifestation of its "internal weakness." Senator Wiley, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, openly said in a speech on June 26 this year: "I have said long ago that most of the current so-called Soviet peace offensive is due to the internal weakness of the Soviet Union," "Now is the time to take advantage of this." Therefore, he advocated, "Let us make our demands to the Soviet Union and support these demands with our own strength." As the tendency of the international situation to ease becomes clearer and clearer, the clamor of this group of bellicose aggressors becomes more and more rampant. However, what is their "strength"? People know that the United States has lost its monopoly on atomic bombs and has been defeated in Korea. So what is left? What remains are hydrogen bombs and international spies, secret agents, assassins, and murderers under the command of the United States. However, the U.S. monopoly on hydrogen bombs has now also been lost. Then, the remaining hope is to carry out subversive and destructive activities within the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' so-called "liberation" policy is a declaration to strengthen the carrying out of such conspiratorial activities. In order to organize this activity, the U.S. government has spent a large amount of money. Recently, House Democratic Leader McCormack has suggested allocating another $300 million for this purpose, while Republican Congressman Keeshin (the drafter of the American "October Act") has even advocated increasing this number to $500 million. The American "Newsweek" also admitted that the U.S. government "will first rely on subversion and destruction in its fierce Cold War." However, the bankruptcy of the Berlin adventure on June 17 has already begun to point out the sad future of this so-called "liberation" policy.
    In the post-war period, the American "policy of strength," after the "containment policy," the direct armed aggression against Korea, and even making subversion and sabotage conspiracies openly as the policy of the government, although it has suffered continuous failures, the American aggression group is unwilling to automatically give up this policy. Recently, the American aggression group's obstruction of the political conference and its procrastination of the Great Power Conference are all examples of the continued implementation of this so-called "policy of strength" that has long been bankrupt. The late American aggressor, Senate Republican Majority Leader Taft, once admitted in a speech on May 26 this year: "The task of the current (American) government is to maintain a worldwide alliance against Soviet Russia. We have spent countless billions of dollars for this purpose." These arguments and the recent actions of the American aggression group must still arouse the vigilance of the people of the world! However, it must be pointed out that all the measures of the American aggression group's "policy of strength" are based on the premise of "internal weakness of the Soviet Union," which is self-comforting and the actual situation is completely the opposite, and its actual consequences cannot but cause chaos and resistance within the capitalist world. Therefore, it is inevitable that it will continue to suffer failure. Therefore, Comrade Malenkov issued a clear warning to these aggressors: "We answer Mr. Wiley and anyone else who openly advocates a policy of strength towards the Soviet Union, we want to answer them directly: Don't mess around, brother! You are going in the wrong direction."

    美国侵略集团的所谓“实力政策”
    张放
    马林科夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议闭幕会议上的演说中，曾郑重指出：“全世界都知道，侵略势力不能够把历史车轮扭向后转的。要想在国际问题上奉行清醒的政策的人们，应当以现实为基础，以事实为基础，不管他们喜欢不喜欢。”这对于那些反对缓和国际紧张局势的美国某些集团无异是一贴适时的清醒剂，因为直到现在他们还公开主张对苏联和世界爱好和平的人民采取所谓“实力政策”。
    美国侵略集团的所谓“实力政策”究竟是什么呢？拆穿来说，就是美国企图取得世界霸权的政策，就是战争政策。它的锋芒指向以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，而却以奴役和掠夺其他资本主义国家为其实际的内容。它的特征是在制造国际纠纷，增加国际紧张气氛，煽动战争歇斯底里，以至最后发动新的世界战争。
    第二次世界大战虽以不利于世界资本主义体系的结果而结束，但美国垄断资本却靠战争发了横财。美国的独占资本家们看到，德、日、意三个资本主义大国战败了，英国和法国也失去了它们以前的地位，并且错误地估计世界和平的堡垒苏联将不能迅速地从战争创伤中恢复过来，因而自以为全世界唯我独尊，怀抱着独霸世界的野心。据战时曾在“美国战略服务局”以及其他美国谍报机关工作过的卡尔·玛尔查尼透露，当一九四五年七八月间原子弹试验获得最后的成功的时候，美国的“冷战”政策就已经正式形成了。“原子外交”或“原子讹诈”就成为这以后美国外交的代名词。战争结束后，杜鲁门叫嚣着“美国要领导世界”，实际上就是以原子弹的“实力”作为他叫嚣战争的根据。
    到一九四七年，美国侵略集团进一步宣布了它的
    “实力政策”的“理论”和具体做法。这年七月，美国国务院的“策士”、恶名昭彰的反苏“专家”凯南曾用“X先生”的化名在美国杂志上写文章，公然提出一种所谓“包围共产主义”的政策。他宣布：美国应该采取“坚定不移的包围政策，旨在用不可动摇的反击力量”，“来抗击俄国人”。这个政策的出发点是假定“苏维埃国家内部的荏弱和不稳定”。实现这个政策的具体做法，是在苏联的周围纠合一批在美国指挥之下的仆从国家，结成“同盟”，使之成为“包围共产主义”的“不可击破的障碍物”。据华尔街的代言人、美国记者李普曼的透露，凯南的这篇文章表明：“国务院已经下了决心，准备把国务院据以制订计划的估计、考虑和结论向美国人民、向全世界、自然也向克里姆林宫宣布。”
    自从那时候以来，美国采取了种种对外侵略措施，例如组织北大西洋侵略集团，实施奴役西欧各国人民的马歇尔计划，在西德和日本复活军国主义，以及围绕着苏联和人民民主国家设立军事基地等等。
    然而现实对于这个“包围政策”的策划者并不是那末美妙的。因为这个“包围政策”的“实力”根据，除了美国的“实力”之外，还需要一个在美国指挥之下的反动的同盟。这自然就要求美国在这个同盟中间拥有发号施令的权力。因此，“包围政策”的锋芒虽然是指向苏联和人民民主国家，而其实际的执行过程则首先是美国对于一系列的资本主义国家，尤其是“老牌”的资本主义国家，例如英、法等国及其殖民地，实行苛刻的奴役和掠夺的过程。这样，美国侵略集团便在资本主义世界内部成为侵略和掠夺的中心，因而也成为各国人民仇恨的中心。美国干涉他国内政、到处侵占军事基地、迫使在它指挥下的国家扩军备战的政策，不但遭到各国人民日益强烈的反对，并使它的附庸和盟国在政治上陷于混乱，经济上受到损害。因而美国的“包围政策”不但没有加强了它与它的盟国的“实力”，反而削弱了这种“实力”。反之，以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营则是更加强大，更加成为世界和平的支柱。历史前进的步子，并没有受到美国“包围政策”的阻挠。
    但是，美国侵略集团不但不愿意承认“包围政策”的失败，它并且从“包围政策”更加往前走一步，发动了对朝鲜的侵略战争。它指望用朝鲜战争煽动起来的反对和平力量的战争歇斯底里，来平复资本主义世界各国对美国政策的不满和反抗；并且利用朝鲜战争进一步促使各资本主义国家的经济向战争轨道的转变，使得美国和其他资本主义国家的经济有可能暂时维持一个虚假的繁荣，来缓和资本主义世界的经济危机。这就是说，美国侵略集团要在朝鲜实行它的“实力政策”来挽救它政治上、经济上破产的危机。但是结果却完全相反，美国在朝鲜遭受了严重的军事上的失败，不得不接受停战。同时，在它组织和煽动朝鲜战争的过程中，它不但没有放弃，而且加强了它在资本主义世界中的发号施令的政策，这就更进一步地引起了各国人民对于美国政策的反抗。甚至某些资本主义国家的统治阶级，为了保持自己对于美国的经济上的竞争力量，为了保持自己在国内的统治地位，也不得不在人民的强大的压力下，在一定的程度内表示不赞同甚至反对美国的这种所谓“实力政策”。
    美国“实力政策”的连续的失败，更加证明用协商方式而不是用武力是解决国际争端的唯一途径。支持这个途径并愿意沿着这个途径前进的人们愈来愈广泛了。这就使得苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的和平政策的支持者遍于全世界，这就使得世界人民和平运动的浪潮更加壮阔。因此，进一步缓和国际局势的可能性更加增加了。
    然而，美国“实力政策”的策划者并不因此就肯承认国际局势的现实发展，相反地，他们继续错误地认为苏联的和平措施是它“内部荏弱”的表现。美国参议院外交委员会主席维利在今年六月二十六日的演说中公然说道：“很久以前我就说过，目前所谓苏维埃的和平攻势大部分是由于苏联内部的荏弱”，“现在是利用这一点的时候了”。因此，他主张“让我们向苏联提出我们的要求，并且用我们自己的实力来支持这些要求。”国际局势走向缓和的倾向愈益明朗，这批好战的侵略分子的叫嚣便也愈益嚣张。然而，什么是他们的“实力”呢？人们知道，美国已经失去了原子弹的垄断了，已经在朝鲜打败了，那末还剩下什么呢？还剩下的是氢弹以及在美国指挥之下的国际间谍、特务、暗害分子和杀人犯。但是，美国对氢弹的垄断现在也失去了。那么，剩下来的指望便是在苏联和各人民民主国家内部进行颠覆和破坏的活动。美国国务卿杜勒斯的所谓“解放”政策，便是要加强进行这种阴谋活动的宣告。为了组织这种活动，美国政府已经花费了大批款项。最近众议院民主党领袖麦考米克又建议为此目的再拨款三亿美元，而共和党众议员凯斯金（美国“十月法案”的起草人）更主张将此数增加到五亿美元。美国“新闻周刊”亦承认，美国政府“在自己的激烈的冷战中将首先依靠于颠覆和破坏”。不过，六月十七日的柏林冒险行动的破产却已经开始指出这种所谓“解放”政策的可悲的前途。
    战后时期，美国的“实力政策”，经过“包围政策”，对朝鲜的直接武装侵略，以至于将颠覆、破坏阴谋公开作为政府的政策，虽然遭受了不断的失败，但美国侵略集团是不甘心自动放弃这个政策的。最近时期，美国侵略集团对于政治会议的阻挠行为，对于大国会议的拖延行为，都是这个早已破产了的所谓“实力政策”还在继续执行的例证。已故的美国侵略分子、参议院共和党多数派领袖塔夫脱在今年五月二十六日的演说中还曾经承认：“现届（美国）政府的任务是要维持一个反对苏俄的全世界性的联盟。我们为了这个目的已经花费了无数亿美元。”这些论调以及美国侵略集团最近的行动，还必须引起世界人民的警惕！然而，必须指出，美国侵略集团的一切“实力政策”的措施，既是从
    “苏联内部荏弱”这个聊以自慰而实际情形完全相反的前提出发的，而其实际的后果又不能不在资本主义世界内部引起混乱和反抗，因而就不可避免地要继续遭受到失败。马林科夫同志因此向这些侵略分子提出了明确的警告：“我们回答维利先生以及其他任何公开主张对苏联采取实力政策的人们，我们要直截了当地回答他们：不要捣蛋罢，老兄！你的步子走错了。”
