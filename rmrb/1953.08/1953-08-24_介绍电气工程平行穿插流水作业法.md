Introducing the Parallel Interspersed Assembly Line Method for Electrical Engineering
Li Chunting Gao Fugui, Second Engineering Area, Construction Engineering Company, Central Ministry of Heavy Industry

Electrical engineering lagging behind civil engineering is a relatively common situation in basic construction. This is a contradiction in complex, multi-trade basic construction. The electrical team of the Second Engineering Area of the Construction Engineering Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has created an advanced working method to solve this contradiction—the parallel interspersed assembly line method for electrical engineering.

Old Method vs. New Method

Anyone familiar with the site will say, "The 'electrical guys' are always drilling holes and digging trenches!" This is the impression left by the old construction method. In the old method, electrical engineering always lagged behind. Long after ground was broken, electrical workers still had nothing to do, waiting idly. Only when the bricklayers built a layer of wall, the carpenters made the formwork, and the rebar workers tied the rebar, could the electricians carry their heavy wooden workbenches to the site and begin their work. By the time of completion, the other carpenters and bricklayers had already left the site, and the electricians were working overtime to rush the progress.

Due to the unreasonableness of the old construction method, concealed wiring in concrete floors and brick walls could not be carried out simultaneously with civil engineering. It was necessary to wait until the concrete was poured and the curing period was over before digging open the concrete according to the electrical drawings to install conduits. It was the same on the main walls; as soon as the bricklayers finished the bricks, the electrical workers had to dig holes and trenches to install conduits and distribution panels on the walls. The entire building was a mess of large and small holes. Last year, when we contracted the dormitory for faculty and staff of the South Lake Project of the Northeast Institute of Technology, we had to dismantle the concrete floor slabs that had already been poured because we couldn't install the conduits. In the Metallurgical Pavilion, electrical conduits were blocked, and a wall was knocked down with an eight-pound hammer. After the ceiling was suspended, it was taken down again to install conduits. More seriously, the old method caused a large amount of electrical work to pile up after the roofing project, with single trades rushing to complete the work, which affected the completion date. Last year, the Northeast Institute of Technology failed to complete the construction in time for this reason, which affected the educational plan.

The new method overcomes the above shortcomings. It changes the organization of labor, dividing it into prefabrication and installation teams, with division of labor, specialized responsibilities, and regulations. All construction procedures are similar to civil engineering, starting and completing at the same time.

Before the start of electrical engineering, workers are first organized to study and discuss the organizational design based on the design drawings and referring to the civil engineering structure, accurately calculate the workload, and then carry out semi-finished product prefabrication, such as cutting iron pipes, welding ground wires, assembling distribution boxes, drilling holes, and punching holes in iron boxes. When the civil engineering project completes the excavation of the ground trenches and backfilling, the installation team assembles and installs the underground pipelines. When the brick wall is built to the height of the switch and socket, the installation team immediately installs the prefabricated risers and horizontal connecting pipes and builds them into the wall. When the brickwork reaches the height of the distribution panel, the electricians immediately install the foundation bolts and distribution box risers. In this way, the concealed electrical works can be closely combined with the civil engineering works and completed simultaneously. When entering the platform for conduit installation, electricians, carpenters, and rebar workers operate at the same time. Before the carpenters make the formwork and the rebar workers stabilize the beams, the electricians install the connecting pipelines in the concrete beams. The floor slab wiring part cooperates closely with the rebar workers, interspersing with each other. After the rebar is laid, the electricians assemble and weld the prefabricated semi-finished products into a complete power distribution pipeline system. At this time, the concrete workers can pour. After the formwork is removed, the installation team immediately checks all the pipelines to see if there are any disconnections, displacements, or mortar blockages. If so, they are immediately repaired, and the pipelines are tested for continuity and cleaned and dried. When plastering begins, the switches, sockets, iron covers, and pipe heads of each branch line are installed. After the last coat of plaster is finished and the indoor humidity is reduced, the wires are immediately run through the pipes, soldered, wrapped, and various equipment and distribution panels are installed. All electrical work is completed before the ground plastering or painting project.

Features of the New Method

What are the benefits of the new method?

First, it has accurate planning, which accelerates the progress of the project. For example, for a project this year, the electrical completion was originally scheduled for five days after the civil engineering handover, but now it is completed simultaneously with the civil engineering. According to the new method, each person can lay 40 meters of pipeline per day, which exceeds last year's level by 260% and this year's new quota by 91%. The new method also completely changed the chaotic situation of electrical engineering and the uneven phenomenon of being loose at the beginning and tight at the end of production. Also, because prefabrication and installation must clarify the amount of engineering tasks in advance, cadres and workers have a clear idea of the quantity, which provides a reliable guarantee for completing the tasks. More importantly, it completes the assembly line method of civil engineering. In the past, carpentry, bricklaying, and rebar work were already operating according to the new method, while electrical and plumbing were still the old way, so the entire civil engineering parallel assembly line method was very incomplete. Now this situation has been changed.

Secondly, it ensures the quality of the project. In the past, the old method of digging trenches on the walls to install conduits after the brickwork was completed often resulted in inconsistent digging depths. Some trenches were very shallow, and after installation, they were plastered with white ash. When pulling the wires, the conduits would fall off, the wall skin would peel off, and the project quality would be seriously damaged. In the past, if the pipeline was too long, it would be bent, and if it was too short, it would be welded, which caused many difficulties for the wiring work, and the quality was also poor. The new method is prefabricated in advance, and there are no more defects in the length of the conduits. It is installed completely according to the drawings and materials, which basically eliminates quality accidents. The representative of the client said: "This year, the plumbing and electrical work has been done really well, which has increased the life of the building."

Thirdly, it can save a lot of materials. In the past, workers worked on site and could not use materials according to their needs. No matter how long it was used, they would take a whole pipe (six meters) and saw off a piece. After the project was completed, there would be a pile of pipe ends left. The use of wires was also the same. The semi-finished products of the new method are prefabricated, so materials can be used according to their needs, which greatly reduces the loss rate of raw materials. For example, the national regulation for the loss rate of iron pipes is 5%, but it has now been reduced to 0.1%, and the loss rate of wires has been reduced from 2% to 0.5%. In addition, cement and plastering workers are also saved because there is no digging of trenches.

In addition, in the past, accidents often occurred because of digging holes, such as walls collapsing and injuring people, scaffolding collapsing and killing people, and wall skins and iron hammers damaging feet. This year, the new method was adopted, and no safety accidents occurred in the main building installation project.

When we promoted the parallel interspersed assembly line method for electrical engineering, we paid special attention to strengthening these tasks: First, we must establish a good team operation plan. After the new construction method is determined, prepare the organizational design, that is, mobilize the masses to discuss the plan, and the construction staff should clarify the amount of engineering, nature, role, and construction method in the group, and formulate the team and group operation plan based on the in-depth discussion of the masses. The team and group operation plan is the main guarantee for the specific implementation of the new construction method. Secondly, it is necessary to make workers familiar with civil engineering drawings. The method is to set up training classes or take the method of learning what to do, so that everyone can quickly become familiar with the drawings. This is an important condition for promoting the new method. Third, it is necessary to establish a technical responsibility system to ensure the project quality of the new method. At the same time, it is necessary to establish a regular inspection system, because if an error occurs when using the new method, it will be difficult to rework after the concrete is poured, which will cause a historical error. Therefore, the significance of regular inspection is even more important in promoting the new method. In addition, strengthening political work, grasping ideological conditions, vivid propaganda and mobilization, and timely commendation of emerging advanced figures are also very important.

    介绍电气工程平行穿插流水作业法
    中央重工业部建设工程公司第二工区  李春亭  高福贵
    电气工程落后于土建工程，这是基本建设施工中较为普遍的情况。这是复杂的多工种操作的基本建设施工中一个矛盾。中央重工业部建设工程公司第二工区电气队，创造了解决这一矛盾的先进工作方法——电气工程平行穿插流水作业法。
    旧法与新法
    熟悉现场的人，一提起“电气”就会说：“他们专门钻窟窿刨洞！”这是旧施工方法留给人们的印象。旧法电气工程向来是跟在后面跑。破土开工好久，电气工人仍旧没有事做，窝工等着。到瓦工砌起一层墙，木工做好盒子板，钢筋工绑好钢筋，电工才能把笨重的木制操作案子抬上操作现场开始自己的工作。到竣工时，其他木、瓦工都已经离开现场了，电工才加班加点，拼命抢进度。
    由于旧施工法不合理，混凝土楼板内的隐蔽配管、砖墙隐蔽配管，都不能跟土建工程同时操作，必须待混凝土浇灌完毕，过了养生期，才按电气图纸刨开混凝土下装线管。在大墙上也是如此，等瓦工刚砌完砖，电气工就得刨窟窿扒沟，在墙上安置线管和分配电盘。满墙满楼都是大窟窿小洞，整个建筑物弄得乱七八糟。去年我们承包东北工学院南湖工程的教职员宿舍，因为安不上线管，曾把已经打好了的混凝土楼板拆开。冶金专馆电气管线不通，用八磅大锤凿眼，曾震倒了一面墙。天棚吊好了，又把它拆掉安装管线。更严重的是旧法使电气工程量大部堆积在屋面工程之后，单工种抢工，影响了竣工日期。去年东北工学院就因为这个原因，建筑未能及时完成，影响了教育计划的进行。
    新的方法克服了以上的缺点，它将劳动组织加以改变，分成预制组、安装组，有分工、有专责、有制度。一切施工程序与土木相似，同时动工，同时竣工。
    在电气工程开工之前，先组织工人研究讨论按设计图纸和参照土建结构所作成的组织设计，精确计算工作量，随即进行半成品预制，如铁管断料、夺丝焊接地线、配分电箱、钻眼及铁盒打眼等活，待土建工程挖完地槽围填土时，安装组就把地中管路装配完了，安装好。砖墙砌到开关插梢的高度时，安装组立即把预制好的立管和横联络管装好并砌到墙里。等砖砌到配电盘的高度时，电工马上将地脚螺丝及配电箱立管装好。这样，电气隐蔽工程就可紧密结合着土建工程同时完成。在进入平台的线管安装时，电工、木工、钢筋工同时进行操作。木工做好模子板、钢筋工稳梁之前，电工就把混凝土梁内的连络管路装好，楼板配管部分和钢筋工密切合作，相互穿插，等钢筋铺完了，电工把预制半成品装配焊接成一个完整的配电管路系统，这时混凝土工可浇灌，等模板拆开，安装组立即检查全部管路，看是否有脱解或移位及灰浆堵塞的毛病，如有，就立即修理，同时进行管路导通和管内清扫干燥等工作。待抹灰开始，就把各分线口开关、插梢、铁盖及管头套装好，等抹完最后一遍灰，室内潮气少了，立即进行管内穿线，接焊包扎，安装各种设备，配分电板。在地面抹灰工程或刷油工程之前，全部电气工程就完工了。
    新法的特点
    新法究竟有什么好处呢？
    首先，有精确的计划，加速了工程的进度。例如今年的一项工程，原预定土建工程交工后五天电气竣工，如今同土建工程同时竣工。按新法铺管线路，每人一天可做四十公尺，超过去年水平的百分之二百六十，超过今年的新定额百分之九十一。新法也彻底改变了电气工程的紊乱情况，和生产前松后紧的不均衡现象。又因为预制安装在事前必须弄清楚工程任务量，使干部和工人心中都有了数，完成任务就有了可靠保证。更重要的是使土建工程流水作业法完整了。过去木、瓦、钢筋已经按新操作法操作，电气、水暖还是老一套，所以整个土建平行流水作业法很不完整，现在则改变了这一状况。
    其次，是保证了工程质量。过去旧法等砌完砖在墙上扒沟安装线管，往往扒的深度不一，有的沟槽很浅，安上以后，用白灰粉刷一遍了事，等安电线时用力一拉，管线掉了，墙皮脱落，严重地损伤了工程质量。过去铺线管长了就弄弯，短了接焊，给穿线工作带来很多困难，质量也低劣。新法是预先做好，线管再也没有长短的缺陷，完全按图纸用料安装，基本上消灭了质量事故。甲方代表说：“今年水暖、电气干的真好呀，给大楼增加了寿命。”
    再次，可节省很多材料。过去工人在操作现场工作，不能量材而用，不管用多长，拿过一根整条管子（六公尺），就锯下一块，工程竣工后剩下一大堆管子头。电线的使用也是如此。而新法的半成品是预制的，就可以量材而用，大大缩减了原材料的损耗率。如国家规定的铁管损耗率为百分之五，现已降低到百分之零点一，电线由百分之二降低到百分之零点五。此外由于不刨沟挖洞，还节约了水泥和抹灰工。
    此外，过去因为挖窟窿倒洞，常常发生墙倒砸坏人，震倒搭架砸死人，墙皮铁锤砸坏脚等事故，今年采用了新法，主楼安装工程没有发生一件安全事故。
    我们在推行电气工程平行穿插流水作业时，特别注意加强了这几个工作：首先，要订好班组作业计划。在新的施工方法确定后，制好组织设计，即发动群众讨论计划，并由施工员在小组阐明工程量、性质、作用、施工方法，在群众深入讨论的基础上订出班、组的作业计划。班、组作业计划是新的施工方法具体贯彻的主要保证。其次，是要使工人熟悉土建图纸，办法是开办训练班或采取做什么学什么的办法，使大家很快的熟悉图纸，这是推行新法的重要条件。第三，要建立技术责任制，以保证新法的工程质量。同时，要建立定时的检查制度，因为采用新法如果发生了错误，打好了混凝土后就很难返工，就将造成历史性的错误，因此在推行新法中定期检查的意义就更其重要。除此，加强政治工作，掌握思想情况，生动的宣传鼓动，及时表扬涌现的先进人物，也是非常重要的。
