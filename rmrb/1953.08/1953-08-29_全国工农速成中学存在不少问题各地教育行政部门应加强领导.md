Throughout the country, education administrative departments should strengthen leadership as numerous problems exist with worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools.

Since the first National Education Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government in December 1949, 56 worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools have been established across the country, enrolling more than 20,000 students. This summer, more than 1,700 students have graduated, most of whom will continue their studies in universities, and some outstanding students will be selected to study in preparatory classes for studying in the Soviet Union.

Over the past three years, worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools have developed significantly and accumulated some experience in teaching. However, due to the lack of sufficient attention paid to this work by the educational administrative leadership departments and the Party and trade union organizations, many problems exist in the work of worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools across the country.

The leadership of the educational administrative departments over the worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools is extremely weak. They rarely study and solve the problems existing in the worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools, and usually just assign tasks without providing specific assistance. Some provincial and municipal educational administrative leadership departments not only fail to find ways to run the schools well from a proactive perspective but also regard the worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools as a "burden." Many chaotic phenomena exist in the teaching work of some schools, but the education departments and bureaus rarely help to inspect and improve them. For example, there are serious bureaucratic work styles in the administrative leadership of the Rehe Province Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School, but the provincial education department, although nearby, has never inspected it (it has recently conducted a review and made some improvements). The Harbin Municipal Education Bureau also rarely discusses and inspects the work of the worker-peasant accelerated secondary school. Similar situations exist in Henan Province, Wuhan City, and Guangzhou City.

Regarding the enrollment of worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools: Over the past three years, the students admitted to the worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools have been selected by the Party organization departments, government personnel departments, and trade union organizations. Although some regions (such as the Northeast Region) and some provinces and cities (such as Hunan Province) have recruited students of better quality due to the importance attached by the leadership. For example, in the Northeast Region, the proportion of worker students accounts for more than 40% of the total number of students, and there are many labor models, such as Zhao Guilan, who have entered the worker-peasant accelerated secondary school to study, which has a good influence. However, from a national perspective, many regions have not paid enough attention to the enrollment work of worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools. For example, some factories, mines, government agencies, and enterprises are unwilling to transfer a sufficient number of excellent workers and worker-peasant cadres to enroll in school, and often send personnel who cannot be placed, cannot work, are difficult to lead, do not meet the requirements, or even have unclear political backgrounds or have committed serious errors in their work to apply for the exam. For example, when the Western Liaoning Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School enrolled students last year, the Western Liaoning Provincial Cadre School recommended eight cadres who had made mistakes and been punished (one of whom had been criminally punished). Among the 548 candidates in the Pingyuan Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School last year, about 25% suffered from serious heart disease, lung disease, gastrointestinal disease, hemoptysis, and uterine disease. The political quality of some students is very poor, and they often violate school discipline; the cultural level is also uneven, with about one-third of them not reaching the equivalent of upper elementary school graduation. Some schools have too many female students with young children, who cannot adhere to normal studies. Some female students even live on campus with their children and nannies. For example, in the Hubei Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School, which has more than 300 students, the number of children and nannies living on campus accounts for one-third of the total number of students. In addition, some students cannot concentrate on their studies due to their advanced age, poor receptivity, or special family difficulties.

There are also many problems in teaching and teacher allocation. In the past, educational administrative leadership departments at all levels had very poor leadership over the teaching work of various schools and had not systematically summarized the teaching work of worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools. Many provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus failed to earnestly implement the State Council's instruction to "allocate excellent teachers to teach." Therefore, many schools have few teachers in both quantity and quality. The leading comrades of some schools have not done enough to cultivate and improve teachers, and have not been able to fully utilize the potential strength of existing teachers; some teachers lack the concept of serving workers and peasants, so they do not feel at ease in their work. The content of the courses taught by many teachers is divorced from reality, and the amount of teaching material is generally too heavy. Students generally feel that they cannot "digest" it and cannot consolidate the knowledge they have learned; as a result, some schools have to "rework," causing some students to lose confidence in learning.

As for the health of the students in the worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools, it is also not good. According to statistics from 30 schools at the end of 1952, students suffering from serious chronic diseases or other serious illnesses accounted for about 3%. Recently, the number of patients in many schools has increased. For example, students in the Shanxi Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School who are recuperating due to illness account for 11% of the total number of students. Some of these students can only take part of the courses and are still in the first grade after studying for three years; some cannot attend classes at all, so they have to go home or recuperate on campus for a long time. Many general students also suffer from headaches, neurasthenia, women's diseases, and gastrointestinal diseases. The reason for this phenomenon is, on the one hand, that the regulations on the admission conditions of students were not seriously implemented and the health of students was not strictly checked when students were admitted; on the other hand, the students' entry level is too low and the learning tasks are heavy, coupled with the lack of improvement in teaching methods, so that students are often in a state of tension and cannot get adequate rest and sleep.

The above situation has seriously affected the completion of the tasks of the worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools. According to statistics from 20 worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools, the number of students who were enrolled in 1950 and graduated in 1953 accounted for only 52% of the students who entered school due to dropouts, suspensions, grade retention, etc. Therefore, it must arouse the deep attention of relevant departments and actively find ways to improve it.

    全国工农速成中学存在不少问题各地教育行政部门应加强领导
    自一九四九年十二月中央人民政府教育部召开第一次全国教育工作会议以来，各地先后举办了工农速成中学五十六所，招收学生两万多人。今年暑期，已有一千七百余名学生毕业，其中多数将升入高等学校继续深造，部分优秀同学则将被选拔至留苏预备班学习。
    三年来，工农速成中学有了大的发展，在教学方面也积累了一些经验。但由于教育行政领导部门和党、工会组织对这一工作没有予以足够的重视，各地工农速成中学工作中存在不少问题。
    教育行政领导部门，对工农速成中学的领导是异常薄弱的。他们很少研究和解决工农速成中学中存在的问题，平常往往只是交代任务，缺乏具体的帮助。有些省市的教育行政领导部门，不仅不从积极方面来设法办好学校，反而把工农速成中学当作“包袱”。有的学校在教学工作中存在很多混乱现象，而教育厅、局很少帮助检查改进。如热河省工农速成中学的行政领导方面有严重的官僚主义作风，而省教育厅虽近在咫尺，却从未对它进行过检查（最近已进行检讨并有所改进）。哈尔滨市教育局也很少讨论和检查工农速成中学的工作，河南省、武汉市和广州市也有类似的情况。
    关于工农速成中学的招生问题。三年来工农速成中学录取的学生，都是由党委组织部门、政府人事部门、工会组织抽调的。虽然有些地区（如东北区）和有些省市（如湖南省），由于领导方面重视，招收的学生质量较好。如东北区工人学生的比例占学生总数的百分之四十以上，并有不少劳动模范，如赵桂兰等已进入工农速成中学学习，影响很好。但从全国范围看，不少地区对工农速成中学的招生工作，并没有予以足够的重视。例如有些厂矿、机关和企业部门，不愿抽调足够数量的优秀工人和工农干部入学，往往将无法安置、不能工作、不好领导、不够条件，甚至把政治面目不清或在工作中犯严重错误的人员送来报考。如辽西工农速成中学去年招生时，辽西省干部学校保送了八名曾犯过错误、受过处分（其中一名曾受刑事处分）的干部。平原工农速成中学在去年的五百四十八名考生中，患有较严重的心脏病、肺病、肠胃病、吐血及子宫病的，竟达百分之二十五左右。有些学生的政治质量很差，经常违犯学校纪律；文化水平也参差不齐，不到相当于高小毕业程度的约有三分之一以上。有些学校有小孩子的女生过多，不能坚持正常学习。还有些学校的女同学竟带着小孩和褓姆住校学习。如湖北工农速成中学学生三百多人，住校的小孩和褓姆人数，竟达学生总数三分之一。此外，部分学生因年龄过大，接受能力差，或家庭有特殊困难，也不能安心学习。
    在教学工作和师资配备方面，也存在不少问题。过去各级教育行政领导部门，对各校教学工作的领导很差，没有系统地总结过工农速成中学的教学工作。不少省市的教育厅、局未能认真贯彻政务院“配备优良教员担任教学”的指示，因此，许多学校的师资，数量既少，质量也差。有些学校的领导同志，对培养和提高教师的工作作得不够，也未能充分发挥现有教师的潜在力量；有些教师缺乏为工农服务的观点，因而不安心工作。许多教师所讲授的课程内容脱离实际，教材分量一般过重，学生普遍感到“消化”不了，不能把学习到的知识巩固起来；以致有的学校不得不“返工”，使部分学生对学习失去信心。
    至于工农速成中学学生的健康情况，也是不好的。据一九五二年年底三十个学校的统计，患有严重的慢性病或其他重病的学生约占百分之三。最近不少学校的病号有增加，如山西工农速成中学因病休养的学生，已占学生总数百分之十一。这些学生，有的只能上一部分课程，读了三年还是一年级；有的完全不能上课，因此只好回家或在校长期休养。一般学生患头痛病、神经衰弱、妇女病和肠胃病的也很多。产生这种现象的原因，一方面是由于在录取学生时没有认真执行关于学生入学条件的规定、对学生的健康情况没有进行严格检查；另一方面是因为学生入学程度太低，学习任务繁重，加以教学方法还缺乏改进，致使学生经常处在紧张的状态中，得不到适当的休息和睡眠。
    以上情况，已严重地影响了工农速成中学的任务的完成。据二十个工农速成中学的统计，一九五○年所招学生，因中途退学、休学、留级等原因，一九五三年毕业人数，仅占入学学生百分之五十二。因此，必须引起有关部门的深刻注意，并积极设法改进。
