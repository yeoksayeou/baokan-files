Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 30th: TASS Moscow dispatch: On August 28th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note from the Soviet government regarding the Austrian State Treaty to the French Embassy in Moscow. The full text of the note is as follows:

    The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs hereby acknowledges receipt of the reply from the French Embassy dated August 17th of this year and deems it necessary to state that this note does not provide a satisfactory answer to the question of the Austrian State Treaty.

    The note of August 17th indicates that the French government has once again failed to clearly state its agreement to resume discussions on the draft Austrian State Treaty, the majority of whose clauses were agreed upon by the four powers of France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States as early as 1949, and thus it is entirely possible to reach agreement on the remaining unresolved issues in this draft. On the other hand, the French government has also not replied as to whether it will withdraw its proposal for a so-called "abbreviated treaty," which disregards the democratic rights of the Austrian people and blatantly violates the Soviet Union's rights to former German assets in Austria as stipulated in the 1945 Potsdam Agreement.

    Such an "abbreviated treaty," unilaterally drafted by the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States in 1952, bypassing the Soviet Union, directly infringes upon the interests of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the French government's refusal to withdraw from the discussion of the "abbreviated treaty" makes it impossible to continue the study of the draft Austrian State Treaty. The Soviet government is compelled to take note of the facts that, as early as July 31st, 1952, the Austrian government publicly declared that "it is impossible to continue discussions based on the old draft treaty," and Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber stated on May 24th, 1952: "Austria is prepared to negotiate on the basis of 1952, and is definitely not prepared to negotiate on the basis of 1949." The Austrian government's note to the Soviet government dated August 19th of this year also indicates that the Austrian government has not withdrawn its official statement of opposition, made last year, to the draft Austrian State Treaty, which had already largely been agreed upon.

    In its note of August 17th, the French government promised that it would be willing to abandon the "abbreviated treaty" draft, provided that certain preconditions were agreed upon. However, these conditions can only create new complexities and delay the discussion of the Austrian State Treaty, which the Soviet government cannot agree to.

    Regarding the French government's suggestion in the note to hold a meeting of the four foreign ministers' assistants on August 31st, the Soviet government considers it necessary to remind Your Excellency of the Soviet government's attitude on this issue, as stated in its note of May 25th of this year. As is known, the meeting of foreign ministers' assistants is not a permanent four-power body. Convening such a meeting falls within the authority of the foreign ministers' conference, and the foreign ministers' conference has not studied this issue at present.

    Regarding the relationship between the Austrian issue and the German issue, the Soviet government deems it necessary to reiterate its statement in the note of August 4th, namely: "If the German issue is resolved, it will be helpful to the resolution of the Austrian issue." At the same time, it is also known that the French government, in its note of July 15th of this year, also assumed that there was some relationship between the German issue and the Austrian State Treaty issue, because in the note it suggested convening a four foreign ministers' conference to discuss two issues: the German issue and the Austrian State Treaty issue.

    The Soviet government has also sent the same note to the British and American governments.

### 关于对奥和约问题  苏联再度照会法英美三国政府

    关于对奥和约问题
    苏联再度照会法英美三国政府
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：八月二十八日，苏联外交部把苏联政府关于对奥和约问题的照会一件交给法国驻莫斯科大使馆。照会全文如下：
    苏联外交部谨通知已收到法国大使馆今年八月十七日发出的复文，并认为必须声明这个照会没有就对奥和约问题给予一个满意的答复。
    八月十七日的照会说明，法国政府这一次也没有明白声明它同意恢复对奥和约草案的讨论，这个草案的大部分条款早在一九四九年就由法、苏、英、美四国取得协议，因而这个草案中其他没有解决的问题也已经完全有可能取得协议。在另一方面，法国政府也没有答复它是否撤回关于所谓“简要和约”的建议，这个和约无视奥地利人民的民主权利，并公然无忌地侵犯了一九四五年波茨坦协定所规定的苏联对奥境前德国资产的权利。
    这样一个“简要和约”是法、英、美三国政府在一九五二年撇开苏联而单独拟定的，它直接侵犯了苏联的利益，因此，法国政府拒绝退出“简要和约”的讨论，就使得对奥和约草案的研究无法继续进行。苏联政府不得不注意到这些事实，就是早在一九五二年七月三十一日，奥地利政府公开声明说
    “已经不可能以旧的和约草案为基础继续讨论”，而奥地利外交部长格鲁伯克生在一九五二年五月二十四日发表的声明曾说：“奥地利准备在一九五二年的基础上进行谈判，而决不准备在一九四九年的基础上进行谈判。”奥地利政府今年八月十九日致苏联政府的照会也说明，奥地利政府没有撤销它去年对已大部分获得协议的对奥和约草案表示反对的官方声明。
    法国政府在它的八月十七日的照会中答应只要同意它的某些前提条件，它愿意放弃“简要和约”草案，然而这些条件只能造成新的复杂局面，并且拖延对奥和约的讨论，这是苏联政府所不能同意的。
    关于法国政府在照会中建议的在八月三十一日举行四国外长助理会议的问题，苏联政府认为有必要提醒阁下苏联政府在这问题上的态度，这是它已在今年五月二十五日的照会中说明过的。大家知道，外长助理会议不是一个永久性的四国机构，召开这种会议，是外长会议权限内的事，而现在外长会议并没有研究过这个问题。
    关于奥国问题与德国问题之间的关系，苏联政府认为有必要重申它在八月四日的照会中的声明，即：“如果德国问题获得解决，对奥国问题的解决是有帮助的。”同时，大家也都知道，法国政府在今年七月十五日的照会也假定德国问题与对奥和约问题之间存在有某种关系，因为它在照会中建议召开一个四国外长会议来讨论两个问题：德国问题与对奥和约问题。
    苏联政府也以同样的照会送交英国和美国政府。
