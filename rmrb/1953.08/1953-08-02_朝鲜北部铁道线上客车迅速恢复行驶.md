    Passenger Trains Quickly Resume Operation on Northern Korean Railway Line
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 1st] Passenger trains on the northern Korean railway lines have begun to resume operation just hours after the Korean armistice. This demonstrates the great strength of the Korean people's forces for peaceful construction. In order to ensure the early resumption and on-time operation of passenger trains, the Korean railway workers, who gloriously completed their wartime transportation tasks, quickly repaired and reinforced the damaged railways and bridges in the north within twelve hours.
    On the Sinuiju-Pyongyang line, the No. 1589 passenger train, the first to resume operation, arrived in Pyongyang from Sinuiju on July 30, carrying model workers, laborers, farmers, and staff members. The locomotive was adorned with a portrait of Marshal Kim Il-sung and the flags of Korea, the Soviet Union, and China, surrounded by various flowers. The neat carriages were equipped with electric fans and loudspeakers, and various slogans celebrating victory and expressing the need to heighten vigilance were pasted on the carriages. The appearance of the passenger train was warmly welcomed by the people along the way. At each station along the route, cheering and singing crowds presented flowers to the railway workers to pay their respects. Upon the train's arrival in Pyongyang, Vice Minister of Railways of Korea, Li Qingqiu, and Minister of the Labor Department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Kim Hwang-il, and others welcomed it at the station.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong Dispatch: At 11:40 AM Korean time on July 31, the first test locomotive after the Korean armistice, locomotive No. 879, pulled a sleeping car into Kaesong Station. The locomotive was decorated with the national flags of Korea and China, and portraits of Marshal Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong were hung on it. On the water tower at the station and on the remaining walls of the station building, huge red paper slogans read: "The unity of the Korean and Chinese people is an invincible force!" "Consolidate and strengthen the steel transport line built with the blood and sweat of the Korean and Chinese people!" The railway from Kaesong to Sinuiju is now unimpeded, and the first train of victory will arrive in Kaesong on August 1.
