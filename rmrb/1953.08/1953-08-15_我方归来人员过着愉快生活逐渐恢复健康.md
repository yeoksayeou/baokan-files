Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 14th: The returned Korean and Chinese captured personnel have received cordial concern and care from the motherland, and they have begun a new, happy, and comfortable life. In the reception station for our returned personnel, rows of neat tents are everywhere, with red flags fluttering in the wind. Pleasant songs are broadcast from loudspeakers. Various brightly colored posters are displayed on wooden signs along the roads. Around the tents are many slogans and patterns made of colored pebbles. The tents are very neat and clean, with soft bedding and blankets on the sleeping bunks.

Our returned personnel, neatly dressed and with ruddy complexions beginning to reappear, are strolling on the grass, bathing by the river, playing musical instruments, or playing cards and chess. The returned personnel of the Korean People's Army have formed a choir. They are practicing songs such as "Construction Song" and "Peace Warrior." The reading room in the reception station is crowded with people every day. They eagerly read various books and newspapers from the motherland. Cai Dejiang, a returned volunteer of the Chinese People's Volunteers from the Northeast, said excitedly when he saw the photo of molten iron being tapped from Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 8 blast furnace: "The motherland's construction is progressing at an astonishing pace! In the future, we must repay the motherland's people for their concern and care by diligently participating in the great construction of the motherland."

Our returned personnel eat rice and white flour shipped from various places every day, as well as fresh meat, vegetables, eggs, and other nutritious foods. People from all walks of life in Kaesong continuously come to the reception station to express their sympathy and concern. The cultural troupes of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, as well as the various troupes from Kaesong City, also take turns coming here to hold performances to express their sympathy and concern.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 14th: Under the responsible treatment and careful care of our medical personnel, the returned sick and wounded captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers have gradually recovered their health after a short period of recuperation.

The doctors in each ward of the hospital diagnose the wounded and sick personnel three times a day. Severely ill and wounded personnel are examined by several doctors at the same time. Nurses take care of the sick and wounded personnel attentively day and night. Personnel who contracted typhoid, pneumonia, and other diseases, and the seriously wounded, in the American prisoner-of-war camps and on the way back were given emergency treatment after being transferred to the hospital. Personnel who were injured by American gas bombs during the repatriation process have recovered their health after treatment. Many sick and wounded personnel had not been able to recover for a long time only because of the American side's extremely irresponsible treatment. They have also quickly recovered their health after a short period of recuperation after returning home. The left thigh of the wounded soldier Yang Yunjiang was fractured. Before repatriation, the doctors in the American prisoner-of-war camp casually performed a plaster "fixation" operation on him. On the way back, his leg became inflamed and painful. After he was sent to our hospital, the doctor found upon examination that the American doctor had not removed the steel wire used to ligate the fracture and the rubber drainage tube when he performed the plaster "fixation". After our doctor removed the steel wire and the rubber tube and drained the pus, the wound healed quickly.

The wounded and sick personnel recuperating in the hospital received rich nutrition. They can eat fresh meat, eggs, and vegetables every day. Critically ill and severely wounded personnel can also eat liquid and soft foods such as milk and custard. However, our sick and wounded captured personnel in the American prisoner-of-war camps only ate barley rice mixed with sand and salt soup every day. They were not only unable to drink boiled water, but even drinking cold water was restricted.

    我方归来人员过着愉快生活逐渐恢复健康
    【新华社开城十四日电】归来的朝中被俘人员受到了祖国亲切的关怀和爱护，他们已开始了新的愉快和舒适的生活。在我方归来人员的招待站内，一排排整齐的帐篷上，红旗到处迎风招展。扩音机播出悦耳的歌声。路旁的木牌上张贴着各种色彩鲜艳的招贴画。帐篷四周有许多用彩色卵石砌成的标语和图案。帐篷内非常整齐清洁，睡铺上铺着柔软的被褥和毛毯。
    衣服整洁，脸上已开始露出红润的我方归来人员，有的在草地上散步，有的在河边洗澡，有的在吹奏乐器，有的在打扑克和下棋。朝鲜人民军归来人员已经组成了一个歌咏队。他们正在练唱“建设之歌”和“和平战士”等歌曲。招待站的书报阅览室里，每天都挤满了人。他们热切地阅读着祖国的各种书报。东北籍的中国人民志愿军归来人员采德江在看到鞍钢八号炼铁炉出铁的照片时，兴奋地说：“祖国的建设真是惊人的快呀！我们今后一定要以努力参加祖国的伟大建设，来报答祖国人民对我们的关怀和照顾。”
    我方归来人员每天吃到从各地运来的大米、白面，和新鲜的肉类，菜蔬，蛋品及其他富有营养的食物。开城各界人民络绎不断地到招待站来慰问他们。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军部队的文工团和开城市各剧团也轮流到这里来举行慰问演出。
    【新华社开城十四日电】在我方医务人员的负责治疗和细心护理下，归来的中国人民志愿军病伤被俘人员经过短期疗养后，已逐渐恢复健康。
    医院各病区的医生，每天给伤病人员诊断三次。对病情伤势严重的人员，有几个医生同时会诊。护士们日夜细心地照料和看护病伤人员。在美方战俘营内及遣返途中患了伤寒、肺炎等病的人员和重伤员，转送到医院以后，就得到紧急治疗。在遣返途中被美方毒气弹伤害的人员经过治疗后，都已恢复健康。许多病伤人员只是由于美方极端不负责任的治疗，而很久不能痊愈。他们遣返归来经过短期疗养后，也都很快的恢复了健康。伤员杨云江的左大腿骨折，在遣返前，美方战俘营的医生草率地替他作了石膏“固定”的手术。在遣返途中，他腿部发炎，疼痛难受。他被送到我方医院以后，经医生检查，发现美方医生在给他作石膏“固定”时，竟没有把伤口内结扎骨折的钢丝和排脓的胶皮管取出来。经过我方医生将钢丝和胶皮管取出并排除脓液以后，伤口已很快愈合。
    在医院内疗养的伤病人员获得了丰富的营养品。他们每天都能吃到新鲜的肉类、鸡蛋和蔬菜等。重病重伤人员还能吃到牛奶、鸡蛋糕等流质和软食。但是，我方病伤被俘人员在美方战俘营中，每天吃的只是掺有沙子的大麦饭和盐汤。平时不仅喝不到开水，连喝冷水也要受到限制。
