Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: The "Pravda" correspondent in Paris reported on the 6th that the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement has aroused enthusiastic comments in the broadest French public opinion.

	Due to the Korean armistice, the French have raised even more determined demands to end the Indochina War. Even "France Soir," which has close ties with the Ministry of the Interior, pointed out: "All French people fervently hope that peace will also extend to Indochina."

	"Combat" said: "The end of the Korean War makes the continuation of the Indochina War a tragedy, in which our financial resources, defense forces, and soldiers are being destroyed. If Washington can negotiate with Kim Il-sung, then why can't Paris negotiate with Ho Chi Minh?"

	It is worth noting that due to the Korean armistice, even government figures have had to admit that the Indochina War is unpopular, and they are also talking about ending the war.

	According to French newspapers, Secretary of State, François Mitterrand, said on July 27th that the Korean armistice "should pave the way" for negotiations on Indochina. He pointed out that in the past seven years, France has spent three trillion francs on the Indochina War.

	French Prime Minister Joseph Laniel and Foreign Minister Georges Bidault, in their talks on the Korean armistice, could not ignore the Indochina War either. For example, Bidault carefully expressed a "hope" in his speech -- a hope that "peace will immediately follow the realization of the long-awaited armistice, and will be further expanded, mainly to Indochina."

	However, the next day (July 28th), "The New York Times" condemned Bidault's remarks as too optimistic and emphasized that it is not yet known whether peace has truly been achieved, or whether military operations will not resume -- a truly ominous sign.

	Such remarks made by certain Americans who are trying to obstruct the resolution of the Korean issue have aroused concern in France. French newspapers have particularly expressed concern that after the end of the Korean War, the U.S. ruling clique will try to expand the Indochina War and obstruct measures to end it.

	The "Pravda" reporter said that French newspaper commentary shows that after the Korean armistice, in France, there is a growing conviction that the time has come to end the Indochina War, which is being waged for the interests of American monopoly capital.

### 在朝鲜停战的影响下  法国舆论坚决要求结束印度支那战争

    在朝鲜停战的影响下
    法国舆论坚决要求结束印度支那战争
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”驻巴黎记者六日报道，朝鲜停战协定的签订在最广泛的法国舆论中引起了热烈的评论。
    由于朝鲜停战，法国人提出了更坚决的结束印度支那战争的要求。甚至是和内政部有密切关系的“法兰西晚报”也指出：“所有法国人都热烈地希望和平也扩大到印度支那去。”
    “战斗报”说：“朝鲜战争的结束，使印度支那战争的继续显得是个悲剧，我们的财力、国防力量和军人在那里毁灭了。如果华盛顿能和金日成谈判的话，那么巴黎为什么不能去和胡志明谈判呢？”
    值得注意的是：由于朝鲜停战，甚至政府人士也不得不承认印度支那战争是不得人心的，而且还谈到要结束这个战争。
    据法国报纸说，不管部部长密特朗曾在七月二十七日说：朝鲜停战“应该为”印度支那的谈判“打开道路”。他指出，在过去七年里面，法国在印度支那战争上花费了三万亿的法郎。
    法国政府首脑拉尼埃和外交部部长皮杜尔在他们的关于朝鲜停战的谈话中，也都不能把印度支那战争置之不顾。譬如皮杜尔就在谈话中小心翼翼地表示了一种“希望”——希望“和平立刻就会继盼望已久的停战的实现而到来，并且更加扩大，主要是扩大到印度支那去”。
    但是，第二天（七月二十八日），“纽约时报”谴责皮杜尔的谈话太乐观，并且着重说，现在还不知道和平是否真正已实现，军事行动是否就不会恢复——这真是不吉之兆。
    某些尽力想阻挠朝鲜问题得到解决的美国人士所发出的这种言论在法国引起了忧虑。法国报纸特别表示关切说，朝鲜战争结束后，美国统治集团将设法扩大印度支那战争，并阻挠促使印度支那战争结束的措施。
    “真理报”记者说，法国报纸的评论表示在朝鲜停战以后，在法国，有一种信念正越来越强烈，这就是：结束为了美国垄断资本的利益而进行的印度支那战争的时候已经到了。
