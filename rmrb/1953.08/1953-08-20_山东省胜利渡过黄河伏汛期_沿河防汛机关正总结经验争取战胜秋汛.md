Shandong Province has successfully weathered the Yellow River's flood season. Currently, flood prevention agencies along the river are summarizing their experiences and deploying efforts to combat the autumn flood.

The middle reaches of the Yellow River experienced widespread rainfall from July 28th to August 4th. The rainfall center was near Balihutong, below Shanzhou, with the highest rainfall reaching over 150 millimeters. The Yellow River tributaries, the Yi River and Qin River basins, also experienced rainfall exceeding 100 millimeters, resulting in two flood peaks below Shanzhou. One flood peak appeared near Qinchang, by the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bridge, at 6:00 AM on August 3rd, with a peak flow of 12,300 cubic meters per second. The other flood peak appeared at 8:00 AM on August 4th, with a flow of 11,440 cubic meters per second. After the August 4th flood peak entered Shandong Province, it merged into one continuous peak, prolonging the duration of the downstream flood. Simultaneously, the Wen River basin in Shandong Province also experienced rainfall of over 130 millimeters, with a peak flow of approximately 3,000 cubic meters per second. All the floodwaters flowed into Dongping Lake, reducing the lake's ability to retain the Yellow River's floodwaters. Furthermore, due to the Yellow River's riverbed rising after the great flood of 1949, the water level rose even though the flood peak flow was not as large as in 1949, contributing to the serious flood situation in Shandong Province.

In order to overcome the flood and ensure the safety of the river defenses, the Shandong Sub-bureau of the CCP Central Committee and the Provincial People's Government instructed Party and government leading organs at all levels along the river to immediately prioritize Yellow River flood prevention work as the most important central task. The Rural Work Committee of the Shandong Sub-bureau, the Shandong Provincial People's Government, and the Shandong Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee also dispatched responsible comrades to Liaocheng and Heze prefectures to inspect and supervise the work. Leading organs at all levels along the river also urgently organized a large number of cadres to conduct in-depth inspections by sections, leading the people day and night to patrol the dikes, check the water, and protect the embankments. Yellow River flood prevention work thus entered an extremely tense battle stage.

During the flood prevention process, the over 400-meter-long revetment project at the Zhukou and Liuzhuang dangerous works in Heze County experienced a collapse and caving in on August 3rd, creating an extremely urgent situation. Through the participation of cadres at all levels and more than 25,000 farmers in the rescue, and after four days and nights of intense battle, the situation was finally turned from danger to safety. Although 333 sections of other county's dangerous works and barrages had experienced caving, collapse, and other phenomena, they were all rescued by the local people's full efforts without any danger. Currently, the river water level has dropped, and a complete victory in the flood prevention has basically been achieved.

Through this flood test, many weaknesses were also found in flood prevention projects, and there were many problems in the organization of the masses and the preparation of tools and materials. When the flood arrived, the flood prevention teams in some areas had not yet been organized, and the preparation of tools and materials was very incomplete, resulting in a hurried and passive situation. Many cadres and civilians lacked flood prevention knowledge, which also increased the difficulty of this flood prevention work. In order to learn from the lessons of this struggle against the flood and strengthen the defense against the autumn flood, the Shandong Provincial Flood Prevention Headquarters has instructed all localities to immediately seize the time after the water recedes to check and summarize the flood prevention work in the previous stage, study and formulate a work plan for the autumn flood defense, and continue to work hard to fight against the Yellow River's autumn flood.

    山东省胜利渡过黄河伏汛期
    沿河防汛机关正总结经验争取战胜秋汛
    山东省已经胜利渡过黄河伏汛期，目前沿河各地防汛机关正在总结经验，部署战胜秋汛的工作。
    黄河中游自七月二十八日至八月四日普遍降雨，降雨中心在陕州以下八里胡同附近，最高雨量达一百五十公厘以上。黄河支流伊洛河及沁河流域降雨也均在一百公厘以上，因而分别造成陕州以下两次洪峰。一次洪峰是八月三日六时出现在京汉铁桥附近之秦厂，洪峰流量为一万二千三百秒公方。另一次洪峰出现在八月四日八时，流量为一万一千四百四十秒公方。八月四日洪峰进入山东境内以后，即首尾相连汇成一次洪峰，致使下游洪水持续时间延长。同时，山东省汶河流域也降雨达一百三十公厘以上，洪峰流量达三千秒公方左右，全部洪水注入东平湖，减少了该湖对黄河的滞蓄作用。再加一九四九年大水后黄河河床淤高，所以此次洪峰流量虽不及一九四九年大，但水位抬高，促成了山东省黄河防汛的严重情况。
    为了战胜洪水，确保河防安全，中共中央山东分局和省人民政府，曾于洪水到来前，指示沿河各级党、政领导机关立即把黄河防汛工作作为当前第一位的中心任务。山东分局农村工作委员会、山东省人民政府、省各界人民代表会议协商委员会等并派负责同志赶往聊城、菏泽两专区检查督导。沿河各级领导机关也都紧急组织了大批干部分段深入检查，带领民工日夜巡堤查水，守护大堤，黄河防汛工作这样就进入了极紧张的战斗阶段。
    在防汛过程中，菏泽县朱口、刘庄险工四百余公尺护岸工程在八月三日曾发生坍塌蛰陷险象，情况万分紧急。经各级干部和二万五千多农民的参加抢救，经过四昼夜的紧张战斗，终于转危为安。其他各县险工埽坝虽先后有三百三十三段发生蛰陷坍塌等现象，但都在当地人民全力抢救下未出危险。目前全河水势已落，已基本取得全线防汛胜利。
    经过这次洪水考验，也发现了防汛工程方面还有不少弱点，在群众组织和工具料物的准备等方面也存在着不少问题。当大水已到，有些地区的防汛队伍尚未组织，工具料物准备很不齐全，以致手忙脚乱，陷于被动。许多地区干部和民工都缺乏防汛知识，也增加了这次防汛工作的困难。为了吸取这次和洪水斗争的教训，加强秋汛防守，山东省防汛指挥部已指示各地在水退之后，立即抓紧检查总结前一段的防汛工作，研究制订秋汛防守工作计划，再接再厉为战胜黄河秋汛而斗争。
