Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 25th:  North Korean People's Army prisoner of war, Nam Won-joon, who returned today, revealed that the U.S. military authorities, at the very last moment of prisoner of war repatriation, were still attempting to use terror tactics to forcibly detain our captured personnel.

Nam Won-joon said that on August 22nd, as they were preparing to leave the Geoje Island Second POW Camp to be repatriated, the Li bandit troops suddenly took him and another twenty-nine of our captured personnel to an extremely remote and empty camp area surrounded by barbed wire. In the camp area were a U.S. Army captain, a Li puppet army officer, and more than ten U.S. and Li puppet army soldiers.

After the Li puppet army soldiers escorted them to this camp area, they ordered them to stand in two rows, pointing bayoneted rifles at their chests. At this time, the Li puppet army officer walked over to them and said, "This is the last chance; if you want to live, you must stay in South Korea." However, they replied loudly, "We want to return to the Republic!" The Li puppet army officer, with a ferocious expression, shouted sternly, "I'll give you two minutes to consider!" After saying this, he made a gesture, and the Li puppet army soldiers holding guns pointed them at them, their fingers on the triggers, threatening them. However, no terror tactics of the U.S. side could shake the firm will of our captured personnel to return to their motherland. Seeing that they could not intimidate them, the U.S. and Li officers had no choice but to release them again.

    美方继续使用恐怖手段
    企图强迫扣留战俘
    【新华社开城二十五日电】今天遣返归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员南元俊揭露：美军当局在战俘遣返的最后一刻，仍旧企图用恐怖手段强迫扣留我方被俘人员。
    南元俊说，八月二十二日，他们准备离开巨济岛第二战俘营遣返归来的时候，李匪军队突然把他和另外二十九个我方被俘人员带到一个极为偏僻空旷的四周围着铁丝网的营场去。营场里有一个美军上尉，一个李伪军军官，和十多个美军和李伪军的士兵。
    李伪军士兵把他们押到这个营场以后，就命令他们站成两排，把上了刺刀的步枪对准了他们的胸口。这时，那个李伪军军官走过来对他们说：“这是最后的一个机会，你们要活命，就要留在南朝鲜。”但是，他们响亮地回答说：“我们要回到共和国去！”这个李伪军军官面目狰狞地厉声说：“给你们两分钟时间考虑！”说罢，他做一下手势，拿着枪对准他们的李伪军士兵就把手指扣在枪的扳机上威胁他们。但是，美方的任何恐怖手段也不能动摇我方被俘人员返回祖国的坚定意志，美李军官看到他们吓不倒人，只得又把他们放了回去。
