Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, August 23rd: The National Garrison Forces Labor Union and the All-Japan Garrison Forces Labor Union, which led a 48-hour protest strike to fight for the legitimate rights and interests of Japanese workers employed by the US Forces in Japan, held a joint struggle meeting on the evening of the 22nd. In view of the fact that the US military authorities and the Japanese Yoshida government insisted on harming the legitimate rights and interests of workers and trade unions in recent negotiations with the trade unions, the meeting decided to call on Japanese workers at US military bases to hold a second 48-hour strike starting on August 28th. The trade union authorities immediately issued instructions regarding the strike to all branches across the country.

    驻日美军雇用的日本工人
    将举行二次大罢工
    【新华社二十三日讯】东京消息：领导着为驻日美军雇用的日本工人争取合法权益而举行过一次四十八小时抗议罢工的全国驻军工会和全日本驻军工会，于二十二日晚举行联合斗争会议。鉴于美国驻军当局和日本吉田政府在最近与工会的谈判中，坚持损害工人和工会的合法权益，会议决定号召美军基地的日本工人自八月二十八日起举行第二次的四十八小时罢工。工会当局并立即向全国各分会发出有关罢工的指令。
