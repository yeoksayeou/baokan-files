Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th: The Soviet people are enthusiastically celebrating the victorious closing of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Working people everywhere continue to gather to discuss the resolutions passed by the Supreme Soviet session and the speech by G.M. Malenkov. The working people have expressed their support for the policies of the Communist Party and the government.

    In Moscow, workers at the Stalin Automobile Factory, the First Ball Bearing Factory, and factories such as "Hammer and Sickle," "Dynamo," "Red Proletarian," and "Three Mountains" have all held discussions on Comrade Malenkov's speech and the documents of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Every workshop and every production department is filled with political and labor enthusiasm. In the automatic lathe workshop of the First Ball Bearing Factory, more than 250 lathes have been using high-speed cutting since the beginning of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, increasing labor productivity by 47 percent. Now, 415 more lathe workers have made new pledges: to strive to complete the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan this year and to increase labor productivity by 70 percent. On August 10, all the workers in this workshop greatly exceeded their daily tasks. Lathe operator Leonova said, "Increasing labor productivity and improving product quality is our response to the resolutions of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union." The "Dynamo" factory is also overflowing with labor enthusiasm. On August 10, the sandblasting workshop issued a notice about Vasilyev, a member of the Communist Youth League, who exceeded his original production target by 400 percent in one shift. More than 400 workers in the factory have already completed their plans for the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

    In Leningrad, hundreds of thousands of working people listened to the broadcast of Comrade Malenkov's speech. On the 10th, workers at the Stalin Metallurgical Factory listened to the propagandist read Comrade Malenkov's speech during their breaks, discussed the documents of the Supreme Soviet session, and put forward many suggestions for improving production. Worker Veselov said, "The Party teaches us that heavy industry is the foundation of the foundation for the further development of our entire economy. The rapid improvement of light industry and the food industry also relies on the development of heavy industry. Therefore, we machine-building workers should work better and give the country more good machines." Veselov is making the outer ring of a large turbine, which has a diameter of 13 meters and weighs about one million tons. He completed more than two quotas that day. In Kuznetsk, thousands of employees of the Stalin Steel Plant actively discussed the resolutions of the Supreme Soviet session and Comrade Malenkov's speech on the 9th and 10th. The plant's employees had successfully completed their production tasks in July and saved the state 10 million rubles from cost reductions. Now, they have put forward guarantees to strive for new labor achievements. Steelworker Nekholoshev, who had overfulfilled the steelmaking plan by 8,000 tons in the first seven months of this year with his two companions, now pledges that the metallurgical workers of Kuznetsk will not let the country down, and I personally guarantee to overproduce another 1,000 tons of steel by the end of the year.

    Metallurgical workers, machine-building workers, miners, and light industry and food industry workers in the Urals, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, and other places have all pledged to respond to the call of the Communist Party and the government with new labor achievements. Ural Serov Steel Plant steelworker Okunev produced 890 kilograms of steel per square meter of furnace bottom on the 9th. Workers in light industry and food industry enterprises in Frunze have been very active these days. They are now able to supply all of Kyrgyzstan with textiles and food. They also guarantee to tap new potential to increase production and improve quality. Workers at the Kharkov Tractor Factory have supplied the state with first-class agricultural machinery ahead of schedule by carrying out rhythmic and balanced production. Defective products in the factory's wrought iron workshop have decreased by 25 percent compared to July last year, saving more than 200,000 rubles ahead of schedule. Now, the factory's workers have made new guarantees to continue to increase labor productivity and produce more high-quality products. Workers at the Tbilisi Machine-Building Factory, which produces high-speed looms, have expressed their support for the Party and government's policy of rapidly developing light industry. Fitter Shapolashvili said, "Our task is to produce more high-speed looms, constantly improve the quality of our products and reduce costs. I personally guarantee to complete no less than two and a half quotas in each shift."

    Collective farmers throughout the Soviet Union are studying the documents of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet with great interest. They unanimously support the resolutions of the session and the new agricultural tax law, and have made pledges to redouble their efforts to strive for a bumper harvest and develop publicly owned animal husbandry. Ye. Balanets, team leader of the Stalin Collective Farm in Dnepropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine, said, "Our country's budget and the new agricultural tax law once again demonstrate the Party and government's great concern for the people. We will work even harder to provide the people with abundant grain and industry with abundant raw materials." Farmers of the Khrushchev Collective Farm in Brovary District, Kiev Oblast, put forward many ways to increase yields and livestock products while discussing the documents. In the Stavropol Territory, 20 state-owned grain farms completed their grain delivery plans on the 10th. The Temizbek State Farm alone delivered more than one million poods (one pood equals 32.76 jin) of new grain.

    以争取新的劳动成就来庆祝最高苏维埃会议闭幕
    苏联人民热烈拥护共产党和政府的政策
    【新华社莫斯科十二日电】苏联人民热烈庆祝苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议的胜利闭幕。各地的劳动人民继续集会讨论最高苏维埃会议所通过的各项决议和格·马·马林科夫的演说。劳动人民纷纷拥护和支持共产党和政府的政策。
    在莫斯科，斯大林汽车工厂、第一球轴承制造厂，以及“镰刀与锤子”、“狄纳莫”、“红色无产者”、“三山”等工厂的工人，都座谈了马林科夫同志的演说和苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议的文件。每个车间、每个生产部门都充满着政治和劳动的热情。第一球轴承制造厂的自动镟盘车间，从第五个五年计划开始以来，已有二百五十多个车床实行高速切削，提高了劳动生产率百分之四十七。现在又有四百十五个车床工人提出了新的保证：争取在今年完成第五个五年计划的任务，并提高劳动生产率百分之七十。八月十日，这个车间的全体工人大大地超额完成了当天的任务。车床女工莱昂诺娃说：“提高劳动生产率和改善产品质量，这是我们对苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议决议的回答。”“狄纳莫”工厂也洋溢着劳动热情。八月十日，翻砂车间出了一张关于共产主义青年团团员瓦西里耶夫的公告，他在一个工作班的时间内超过原定的生产目标百分之四百。工厂中还有四百多个工人已经完成了他们为第五个五年计划而制订的计划。
    在列宁格勒，有几十万劳动人民收听了马林科夫同志的演说的广播。十日，斯大林冶金工厂的工人们在休息时，听了宣传员宣读马林科夫同志的演说，讨论了最高苏维埃会议的文件，并提出了许多改进生产的建议。工人维塞罗夫说：“党教导我们说，重工业是进一步发展我们所有经济的基础之基础。轻工业和食品工业的急剧提高，也依靠重工业的发展。因此我们机器制造工人应当更好地劳动，给国家更多的好机器。”维塞罗夫正在制造大透平的外圈，这个圈的直径有十三公尺，重约一百万吨。他在十日那天完成了两个多定额。在库兹涅茨克，斯大林钢铁厂的几千个职工在九、十两日，积极地讨论了苏联最高苏维埃会议的决议和马林科夫同志的演说。该厂职工在七月份曾胜利地完成了生产任务，并从降低成本中为国家节约一千万卢布。现在他们又纷纷提出了争取新的劳动成就的保证。炼钢工人涅霍洛雪夫曾和他的两个同伴在今年头七个月中超计划炼钢八千吨，他现在提出保证说：库兹涅茨克的冶金工人，不会辜负国家的期望，我自己保证到年底再超额多炼一千吨钢。
    乌拉尔、吉尔吉斯、格鲁吉亚等地的冶金工人、机器制造工人、矿工、轻工业和食品工业工人们，都保证以劳动新成就来响应共产党和政府的号召。乌拉尔塞罗夫钢铁厂炼钢工人奥库涅夫，九日在每平方公尺炉底产钢八百九十公斤。伏龙芝轻工业和食品工业企业工人们这两天非常活跃。他们现在已能供给全吉尔吉斯的纺织品和食品。他们并保证要发掘新潜力来增加产品和提高质量。哈尔科夫拖拉机工厂的工人，由于进行有节奏和均衡的生产，已超计划供给了国家头等农业机器。该厂的锻铁车间的废品，比去年七月减少了百分之二十五，超计划节约了二十多万卢布。现在该厂工人又提出了新的保证，要继续提高劳动生产率，多生产优等产品。生产高速织布机的第比利斯机器制造厂的工人们，纷纷表示拥护党和政府迅速发展轻工业的政策。钳工夏保拉什维里说：“我们的任务是生产更多的高速织布机，不断地改善产品的质量和减低成本，我个人保证每个工作班完成不少于两个半定额。”
    苏联各地的集体农民都怀着极大的兴趣研究最高苏维埃第五次会议的文件。他们一致拥护会议的决议和新农业税法，并纷纷提出保证，要为争取丰收和发展公有饲畜业而加倍努力。乌克兰第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州斯大林集体农庄工作队队长叶·巴拉涅茨说：“我们国家的预算和新农业税法又一次证明了党和政府对人民的极大的关怀。我们将更加努力地工作，使人民得到丰富的粮食，使工业得到丰富的原料。”基辅州布洛瓦尔区赫鲁晓夫集体农庄的农民们在讨论文件时，提出许多提高收获量和牲畜产品的办法。在斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区，有二十个谷物国营农场在十日完成了交纳粮食的计划。单是捷米兹别克一个国营农场就交纳了一百万普特（一普特合三十二点七六市斤）以上的新谷物。
