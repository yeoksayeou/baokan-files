    Xingkai Lake Fish Products are Sold to Various Regions
    Xingkai Lake, located on the Sino-Soviet border within Songjiang Province, is producing whitefish, carp, bighead carp, Far Eastern catfish, sturgeon, and "rabbit fish" this year, which are being shipped and sold to various regions.
    Xingkai Lake is located downstream of the Ussuri River, where Songjiang Province in China borders the Soviet Union. The lake water is suitable for developing freshwater aquaculture. After the Songjiang Provincial People's Government conducted a preliminary survey of the aquatic resources in a lake area belonging to China in 1950, a fishing team of more than 120 fishery workers was formed in 1951 to start fishing on Xingkai Lake. In 1952, the Songjiang Provincial People's Government established the Xingkai Aquatic Products Company on the shore of the lake and built fish salting factories, ice cellars, and docks. This year, in order to catch a large number of fish, Xingkai Aquatic Products Company has added more than 20 cadres and more than 100 workers who have been engaged in fishing operations for a long time. In May and June alone, more than 430,000 catties of fish have been caught.

    兴凯湖鱼产向各地运销
    松江省境内中苏两国接境线上的兴凯湖，今年出产的白鱼、鲤鱼、胖头鱼、法罗鱼、鲟鱼、兔子鱼，已向各地运销。
    兴凯湖位于乌苏里江的下游，在我国松江省和苏联接界的地方。湖水适宜于发展淡水养殖事业。一九五零年，松江省人民政府在属于我国的一块湖区内作了水产资源的初步调查后，一九五一年便组成了一百二十多名渔业工人的捕鱼队，开始在兴凯湖上捕鱼。一九五二年，松江省人民政府又在湖畔设立了兴凯水产公司，建设了腌鱼工厂和冰窖、码头等。今年，兴凯水产公司，为了大量捕鱼，又增加了二十多名干部和一百多名长期从事捕鱼作业的工人。仅在五、六两月，就已捕鱼四十三万多斤。
