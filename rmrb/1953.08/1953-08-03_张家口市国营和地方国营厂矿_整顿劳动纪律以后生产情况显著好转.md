    After more than a month of ideological education, especially addressing the lax labor discipline, the staff and workers recognized the harm of not adhering to labor discipline to production, and understood that consciously abiding by labor discipline is the duty of the working class. As a result, they consciously put forward guarantees for consolidating labor discipline and launched ideological struggles against various behaviors that undermined labor discipline. This improved the attendance rate and fundamentally reversed the serious situation in May where state-owned and local state-owned enterprises in Zhangjiakou City could not comprehensively and balancedly fulfill the state plan.

    In May, most of the larger state-owned factories and mines in Zhangjiakou City failed to comprehensively and balancedly complete the state plan. The attendance rate was low, absenteeism, leave, and work-related accidents continued to increase. Taking the Mining Machinery Factory as an example, the number of workdays lost due to absence in the first quarter reached 5,941, causing a loss of 729.21 million yuan to the state. Violations of operating procedures causing work-related accidents and affecting production were also very serious. The main reasons for the lax labor discipline were: with the expansion of national industrial construction, a considerable number of urban residents, farmers, and handicraft workers, among other small producers, poured into the ranks of the working class. The total number of employees in Zhangjiakou City at the end of 1952 increased by 66.4 percent compared to 1951; and the political and ideological leadership in various enterprises was generally weak, which allowed bad habits such as freedom, laxity, lack of organization and discipline, selfishness, and self-interest to grow. Some workers did not understand the correct relationship between production and life, and misunderstood the concept of "being the master of the house."

    In order to rectify labor discipline and strengthen education on abiding by labor discipline, the Zhangjiakou City Federation of Trade Unions, under the leadership of the Party Committee, convened a conference of cadres at the level of basic team leaders and above. It explained the serious situation of the current lax labor discipline and the significant losses caused to the state, pointed out the reasons for this situation, and called on everyone to fight against all phenomena that undermine labor discipline. At the same time, it criticized the economism and tailism of trade union cadres. After the meeting, it guided the masses to consciously carry out inspections of labor discipline through typical events. The Zhangxuan Daily published the facts of worker Yang Rong's serious violation of labor discipline, and the city's employees launched a criticism of Yang Rong's erroneous thinking. Many employees conducted self-criticism by connecting their own experiences with the criticism of Yang Rong's erroneous thinking. While guiding the masses to criticize erroneous thinking, some factories commended model individuals who consistently abided by labor discipline, and some even issued material rewards.

    When organizing workers to inspect labor discipline, various factories and mines focused on conducting communist education for the workers, making them realize that the great future and beautiful happiness can only be achieved through the unremitting efforts of the entire working class. Abiding by labor discipline and striving to improve labor productivity is the glorious task of the working class. After education, the workers of the Zhangjiakou Flour Factory consciously formulated guarantee conditions for consolidating labor discipline.

    At this time, the City Federation of Trade Unions also convened a meeting of cadres at the level of family group leaders and above in various industrial systems to mobilize them to cooperate with the factories in rectifying labor discipline.

    After more than a month of labor discipline education in Zhangjiakou City, various factories have achieved significant results in production. The Prospecting Factory, Food Factory, and others failed to complete the state plan targets in May. In June, the Prospecting Factory overfulfilled by 131 percent, and the Food Factory overfulfilled by 119 percent. For example, the Zhangyuan Cigarette Factory's attendance rate was only 80 percent in the past, while in June, the highest attendance rate for male workers reached 99.7 percent and for female workers, 88.8 percent. Due to the increase in attendance rate and labor productivity, responsibility accidents and defect rates have been relatively reduced, fundamentally reversing the serious situation where various factories could not balancedly complete the state plan.

    张家口市国营和地方国营厂矿
    整顿劳动纪律以后生产情况显著好转
    张家口市国营和地方国营厂矿整顿劳动纪律工作已获得显著成绩。经过一个多月时间的思想教育，特别是针对劳动纪律松弛的现象进行了教育，职工群众认识到不遵守劳动纪律对生产的危害，懂得了自觉遵守劳动纪律是工人阶级的义务，因而自觉地提出巩固劳动纪律的保证，并与各种破坏劳动纪律的行为展开了思想斗争，因而提高了出勤率，基本上扭转了五月份张家口市各国营和地方国营企业不能全面均衡地完成国家计划的严重情况。
    五月份张家口市各较大国营厂矿大部分没有全面均衡地完成国家计划，出勤率低，旷工、请假和工伤事故不断增加，以矿山机械厂为例，第一季度缺勤工数达到五千九百四十一个工作日，给国家造成了七亿二千九百二十一万元的损失。违犯操作规程造成工伤事故影响生产的现象也很严重。劳动纪律松弛的主要原因是：随着国家工业建设的展开，相当数量的市民、农民、手工业者等小生产者涌进了工人阶级的队伍，张家口市一九五二年底职工总数与一九五一年相比，增加了百分之六十六点四；而各企业又较普遍地存在着政治思想领导薄弱，致使自由散漫、无组织无纪律、自私自利的坏习气得以滋长，有些工人不懂得生产和生活的正确关系，对“当家作主人”发生误解。
    张家口市总工会为了整饬劳动纪律和加强遵守劳动纪律教育，在党委的领导下，召开了各基层小组长以上干部大会，说明了目前劳动纪律松弛的严重情况和给国家造成的重大损失，指出产生这种情况的原因，号召大家向一切破坏劳动纪律的现象作斗争，同时批判了工会干部的经济主义和尾巴主义思想。会后，便通过典型事件引导群众自觉的展开劳动纪律的检查。张宣日报刊登了工人杨荣严重破坏劳动纪律的事实，全市职工展开了对杨荣错误思想的批判，很多职工从批判杨荣错误思想中联系自己进行检讨。在引导群众批判错误思想的同时，有些厂对一贯遵守劳动纪律的模范人物进行了表扬，有的还发了物质奖。
    各厂矿在组织工人检查劳动纪律时，着重地对工人进行共产主义教育，使工人们认清了前程远大和美好幸福的将来，是靠全体工人阶级不懈的努力来取得的。遵守劳动纪律，努力提高劳动生产率是工人阶级的光荣任务。张市面粉厂的工人经过教育，自觉地订出巩固劳动纪律的保证条件。
    这时市总工会还召集各工业系统职工家属小组长以上的干部会，动员他们配合厂里整饬劳动纪律。
    张家口市经过一个多月劳动纪律的教育，各厂在生产方面已获得显著成绩。探矿厂、食品厂等五月份没有完成国家计划指标，六月份探矿厂超额完成百分之一百三十一；食品厂超额完成百分之一百一十九。又如张垣纸烟厂过去出勤率仅达百分之八十，而六月份出勤率男工最高达到百分之九十九点七、女工百分之八十八点八。由于出勤率和劳动生产率的提高，责任事故、废品率相对降低，基本上扭转了各厂不能均衡完成国家计划的严重情况。
