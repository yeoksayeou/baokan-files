The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Sends a Congratulatory Telegram to the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace:

    On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of Korea's liberation, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace extends warm congratulations to the heroic Korean people who have won a great victory in the anti-aggression struggle.
    Today, the Korean people are facing the great task of restoring national unity and rebuilding the national economy that has been devastated by the war. The Chinese people will actively support and assist the Korean people in all of this. The Chinese people will always stand firmly with the Korean people and will make unremitting efforts to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to defend peace in Asia and the world.
    We wish the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples to be continuously consolidated and developed, and we wish the Korean people success in their great struggle to achieve the peace and unification of their motherland and to recover from the wounds of war.
                        The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions Sends a Congratulatory Telegram to the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, to the Korean Worker Brothers and Sisters:

    On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of Korea's liberation, on behalf of the Chinese working class, I extend the highest respect to the heroic Korean people and the Korean working class!
    The three-year anti-American war to defend the country waged by the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, achieved a great victory due to the heroic struggle of the Korean people and the strong support of the Chinese people, and due to the sympathy and support of the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people all over the world. The armistice negotiations, which lasted for more than two years, finally forced the aggressors to sign the armistice agreement due to the policy of the Korean and Chinese peoples to adhere to a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and the efforts of the people of the world for peace. This is a victory for the people of China and Korea, and a victory for the people of the world. However, some warmongers in the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique are still clamoring to undermine the armistice agreement. The Chinese working class will, together with the Korean working class, vigilantly stand fast at our posts and ensure the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Chinese workers should step up production, practice strict economy, and actively assist the Korean people in restoring the wounds of war, and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the establishment of a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent new Korea!
    Long live the friendship and unity of the working classes of China and Korea!
                                     All-China Federation of Trade Unions
                                        August 14th

    我国各人民团体电贺朝鲜解放八周年
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的贺电朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会：
    当此朝鲜解放八周年之际，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会谨向获得了反侵略斗争伟大胜利的英雄的朝鲜人民致热烈的祝贺。
    今天朝鲜人民正面临着恢复国家统一和重建遭受战争破坏的国民经济的伟大任务，中国人民在这一切方面将给朝鲜人民以积极的支持和帮助。中国人民将永远坚定地与朝鲜人民在一起，为了争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，为了保卫亚洲及世界的和平作不懈的斗争。
    祝中朝两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊不断巩固与发展，祝朝鲜人民为实现祖国的和平、统一与恢复战争创伤的伟大斗争获得成功。

                              一九五三年八月十四日
    中华全国总工会的贺电朝鲜职业总同盟转朝鲜工人兄弟姊妹们：
    值此朝鲜解放八周年，谨代表中国工人阶级向英勇的朝鲜人民和朝鲜工人阶级致崇高的敬礼！
    历时三年的朝鲜人民的抗美卫国战争，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅的领导下，由于朝鲜人民的英勇奋斗和中国人民的有力支援，由于以苏联为首的和平阵营及全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持，而取得了伟大的胜利。迁延二年余的停战谈判也由于朝中两国人民坚持和平解决朝鲜问题的政策和世界人民为和平事业而作的努力，终于迫使侵略者在停战协定上签了字。这是朝中两国人民的胜利，也是全世界人民的胜利。但是美国一部分好战分子与李承晚集团还在叫嚣破坏停战协定。中国工人阶级将与朝鲜工人阶级一起警惕地坚守自己岗位，保障朝鲜停战协定的彻底实现。中国工人当加紧生产，厉行节约，积极援助朝鲜人民恢复战争创伤，为争取和平解决朝鲜问题，建立统一、民主、和平、独立的新朝鲜而斗争！
    朝中两国工人阶级的友谊与团结万岁！
                                     中华全国总工会

    中朝两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
