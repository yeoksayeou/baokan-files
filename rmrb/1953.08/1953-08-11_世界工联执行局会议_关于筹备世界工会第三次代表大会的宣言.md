    World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau Meeting
    Declaration on Preparing for the Third World Trade Union Congress
    [Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, August 9th] TASS, Vienna, August 9th: The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions unanimously adopted the following declaration on preparing for the Third World Trade Union Congress, which will open in Vienna on October 10, 1953:
    The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions discussed the preparations for the Third World Trade Union Congress, which will open in Vienna on October 10, 1953. The Executive Bureau noted that the working people of all countries warmly support the call for the convocation of this congress. This is a great congress of unity and friendship, and all trade union organizations, whether or not they have already joined the World Federation of Trade Unions, can participate in this congress. At this congress, the working people can freely discuss many issues in their daily lives—wages, the right to work, working conditions, the rights of women and youth, and the elimination of any discrimination, etc.
    Preparatory meetings for the Third World Trade Union Congress are already being held in many countries. Preparatory meetings are being held in factories, workshops, mines, and rural areas on an increasingly large scale, which is the best proof of the democratic nature of the preparatory movement.
    The Third World Trade Union Congress will be a milestone in the history of the international labor movement. The convening of the congress is taking place at a time of great changes in the international situation, and therefore it will play a greater role.
    The working people are uniting more and more closely in the struggle to satisfy their immediate interests, to fight for their rights and freedoms, and to strive for peace. In this struggle, they have achieved great successes. One of the greatest achievements is the realization of the Korean armistice. The Korean armistice is a great victory for the forces of peace and is the result of the hard work of the world peace movement. And in the peace movement, workers play a decisive role.
    The Korean armistice proves that the people of all countries can force governments that advocate war to resolve international differences peacefully and force them to resolve all outstanding international issues through consultation.
    Indeed, the war forces, doomed to failure, are still launching the most arrogant provocations. They want to provoke international discord in order to create conflict.
    The task of the working people is to be more vigilant than ever.
    Men and women working people! Unity will be the main spirit of the Third World Trade Union Congress, which welcomes the participation of all trade unions.
    In all enterprises and trade unions, discuss the preparations for the Third Congress with your worker friends!
    Step up the preparations for the congress!
    Elect your representatives!
    Intensify your activities and strengthen unity!
    Make your Third World Trade Union Congress a great congress of the unity of the world working class, and make it a milestone in the struggle for the happiness of all working people, for human progress and peace.
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 9th] TASS, Moscow: "Labor News" published on the 6th an article by Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, on the convening of the Third World Trade Union Congress.
    Saillant said in the article: Millions of workers know that the Third World Trade Union Congress, to be held in Vienna from October 10 to 21, is a huge labor conference on a world scale. The convening of this congress is in line with the aspirations of the broad masses to strive for their immediate interests, peace and democracy. The main task of the congress is to study the issues of greatest concern to the workers and to seek the best ways to solve these issues. The most important issues on the agenda of the congress are: the unity of the working class, the defense of democracy and the right to organize trade unions in capitalist and colonial countries, and the development of the trade union movement in colonial and dependent countries.
    Saillant said: Preparations for the congress have begun in countries around the world. Its success will depend on the scope of the preparatory work and the active participation of the workers. Today, preparatory work is more likely to succeed than before, because millions of workers are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of the World Federation of Trade Unions and support the convening of the Third World Trade Union Congress.
    Saillant pointed out: This congress will be larger in scale than previous congresses. The task of this congress is not only to have representatives from trade union organizations that have joined the World Federation of Trade Unions, but also to have representatives directly elected by workers in various enterprises to participate in the congress as extensively as possible. The desire for united action and international trade union solidarity is now a decisive force. Driven by this desire, the working people will surely be able to overcome any obstacles and establish unity among us.
    Saillant wrote in conclusion that as long as we actively launch a movement to explain the purpose of the congress, we can ensure the extensive participation of representatives directly elected by workers of different nationalities and political views. The convening of a congress with such broad representation will be a blow to the evil plans of the warmongers, who are trying to isolate the exploited people in capitalist countries from the workers in the socialist camp. As long as we more widely develop preparatory work among the masses, tirelessly strengthen concerted action and the unity of the world working class to defend peace and the happiness of the people, the success of the Third World Trade Union Congress is guaranteed.

    世界工联执行局会议
    关于筹备世界工会第三次代表大会的宣言
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社维也纳九日讯：世界工会联合会执行局会议一致通过关于筹备世界工会第三次代表大会的宣言如下：
    世界工联执行局讨论了将于一九五三年十月十日在维也纳开幕的世界工会第三次代表大会的筹备工作。执行局注意到，世界各国劳动人民都热烈拥护召开这次代表大会的号召。这是一个伟大的团结和友爱的代表大会，所有工会组织，不论它们是否已经参加世界工联，都可以参加这次大会。在这次代表大会上，劳动人民可以自由地讨论他们日常生活中的许多问题——工资、工作权利、劳动条件、妇女和青年的权利及消除任何歧视等问题。
    许多国家中已在举行世界工会第三次代表大会的筹备会议。在工厂、作坊、矿山和农村中举行着筹备会议，规模越来越大，这是筹备运动的民主性质的最好证明。
    世界工会第三次代表大会将是国际劳工运动史上的一个里程碑。大会的召开正是在国际局势发生巨大变化的时候，因此它将发生更大的作用。
    劳动人民正越来越紧密地团结在争取满足切身利益、争取自身的权利和自由以及争取和平的斗争中。在这个斗争中，他们已取得了巨大的成就。最大的成就之一就是朝鲜停战的实现。朝鲜停战是和平力量的伟大胜利，是世界和平运动的努力工作的结果。而在和平运动中，工人起着决定性的作用。
    朝鲜停战证明，各国人民可以迫使鼓吹战争的政府和平解决国际分歧，迫使它们用协商方式解决一切悬而未决的国际问题。
    的确，注定要失败的战争势力仍在发动最狂妄的挑衅。他们要挑拨国际不和，以便制造冲突。
    劳动人民的任务是要比以往更加警惕。
    男女劳动人民！团结一致将是欢迎所有工会参加的世界工会第三次代表大会的主要精神。
    在一切企业和工会中，与你们的工人朋友讨论第三次代表大会的筹备工作吧！
    加紧进行代表大会的筹备工作！
    选出你们的代表！
    加紧你们的活动，加强团结！
    使你们的世界工会第三次代表大会成为一个伟大的世界工人阶级团结一致的大会，使它成为争取全体劳动人民的幸福、争取人类进步与和平的斗争中的里程碑。
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“劳动报”六日登载了世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬关于召开世界工会第三次代表大会的一篇文章。
    赛扬在文章中说：千百万工人都知道，十月十日到二十一日将在维也纳举行的世界工会第三次代表大会，是一次巨大的世界规模的劳工大会。这一大会的召开符合于广大群众争取切身利益、和平与民主的愿望。大会的主要任务就是研究工人们最关切的问题，并求得解决这些问题的最好的办法。大会议程中最主要的问题是：工人阶级的团结，在资本主义和殖民国家中保卫民主与组织工会的权利，在殖民地和附属国家中发展工会运动的问题。
    赛扬说：大会的筹备工作已在世界各国展开。它的成功将决定于筹备工作的范围是否广泛，决定于工人的积极活动。今天，筹备工作比以前更有可能成功，因为千百万工人越来越清楚地明白世界工会联合会的重要性，并且拥护世界工会第三次代表大会的召开。
    赛扬指出：这次大会规模将比前几次的大会更大。这次大会的任务不仅要使已加入世界工联的工会组织派代表来，还要极广泛地使各企业中工人直接推选出来的代表来参加大会。要求统一行动和国际工会团结的愿望在今天已是一种具有决定意义的力量。劳动人民在这一愿望的推动下，就一定能够战胜任何障碍，建立起我们之间的团结。
    赛扬在最后写道，只要我们积极展开一个运动来解释大会召开的目的，那就能保证不同国籍和各种政治观点的工人所直接推选出来的代表能广泛地参加大会。召开一个具有这样广泛代表性的大会将是对战争贩子的罪恶计划的一次打击，他们企图把资本主义国家中的被剥削的人们和社会主义阵营的工人隔绝开来。只要我们在群众中更广泛地展开筹备工作，不倦地加强一致行动和世界工人阶级的团结，来保卫和平与人民的幸福，世界工会第三次代表大会的成功就是有保证的。
