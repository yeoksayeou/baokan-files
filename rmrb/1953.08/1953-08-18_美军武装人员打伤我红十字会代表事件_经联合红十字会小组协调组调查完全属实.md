Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 17th. The incident in which Mr. Pan Fang, the representative of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross at the Imjin River Bridge Prisoner of War Transfer Station Group of the Joint Red Cross Group, was struck by U.S. military personnel with a rifle has been confirmed by the Joint Red Cross Group Coordination Team investigation.

On the afternoon of the 13th, around 6:30 PM, as vehicles carrying soon-to-be-repatriated Korean-Chinese prisoners of war drove into the Imjin River Transfer Station and passed in front of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives' tent, Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives Mr. Zheng Xu and Mr. Pan Fang walked out of the tent to wave and greet our captured personnel. However, the U.S. military authorities forcibly ordered Mr. Zheng Xu and Mr. Pan Fang to return to the tent. Representatives Zheng and Pan immediately stated that the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives were extending greetings and showing concern to our captured personnel, and the other side should not unreasonably obstruct them. At this time, the U.S. personnel ordered Charles H. Hitchcraft, the armed guard supposedly “protecting” the safety of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives standing beside them, to rudely drive representatives Zheng Xu and Pan Fang back to the tent, which was again met with stern rejection by Mr. Zheng and Mr. Pan. Finally, this U.S. military personnel member even used the muzzle of his rifle to strike Mr. Pan Fang's chest and legs.

After the incident occurred, the Joint Red Cross Group Coordination Team dispatched Mr. Tang Qing, the representative of the Korean-Chinese side, and Mr. Cruz, the representative of the Philippine Red Cross, to the scene of the incident at 6:00 PM on the 15th to conduct an investigation, proving that the above situation was completely true. When the victim, Pan Fang, described what happened, the U.S. military authorities' representative present could not deny it.

During the investigation, the Korean-Chinese representative Tang Qing asked Charles H. Hitchcraft, the U.S. military personnel who injured representative Pan Fang: "Were you ordered by the military authorities to raise your gun and interfere when the representative came out of the tent?" Charles H. Hitchcraft replied: "Yes, I received such an order."

    美军武装人员打伤我红十字会代表事件
    经联合红十字会小组协调组调查完全属实
    【新华社开城十七日电】联合红十字会小组临津江桥战俘转运站分组的朝中红十字会代表潘芳先生被美军武装人员用步枪撞击的事件，已经联合红十字会小组协调组调查属实。
    十三日下午六时半左右，载着即将遣返的朝中被俘人员的汽车驶入临津江转运站经过朝中红十字会代表帐篷面前的时候，朝中红十字会代表郑旭、潘芳两先生就走出帐篷向我方被俘人员招手致意。但是美军当局却强令郑旭、潘芳两先生返回帐篷。郑、潘两代表当即表示，朝中红十字会代表向我方被俘人员致意慰问，对方不应无理阻挠。此时，美方人员竟命令其站在旁边所谓“保护”朝中红十字会代表安全的武装警卫查尔斯·赫其拉夫特无礼驱赶郑旭和潘芳两位代表回帐篷去，当又遭到郑、潘两先生严正拒绝。最后，这个美军武装人员竟用步枪枪口向潘芳先生的胸部和腿部撞击。
    事件发生后，联合红十字会小组协调组于十五日下午六时指派朝中方面代表唐清与菲律宾红十字会代表克鲁兹两人前赴出事地点进行调查，证明上述情况完全真实。当受害人潘芳叙述事实经过时，在场的美军当局代表亦无法否认。
    在调查时，朝中代表唐清曾问伤害潘芳代表的美军武装人员查尔斯·赫其拉夫特：“你是否受到军事当局的命令，当代表出帐篷时，就举起枪来干涉他？”查尔斯·赫其拉夫特答道：“是的，是接到这样的命令的。”
