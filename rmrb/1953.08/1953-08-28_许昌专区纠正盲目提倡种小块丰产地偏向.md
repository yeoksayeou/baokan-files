The Xuchang Special District in Henan Province, in the process of cultivating "small-scale high-yield plots," experienced a tendency to blindly invest regardless of cost, which is currently being examined and corrected. Cultivating "small-scale high-yield plots" has yielded good results in some areas. For example, Su Dianxuan of Lushan cultivated ten mu of wheat using rational close planting, achieving a yield of 450 jin per mu. Xu Bingchen of Xiangcheng County cultivated two and a half mu of high-yield tobacco, achieving a yield of 576 jin per mu due to improved production techniques. These model examples played a significant demonstrative role for farmers. However, many local cadres, in mutual aid teams with "shared livestock troughs" and those led by labor models and production activists, advocated cultivating "small-scale high-yield plots." Their purpose was not to help farmers improve production and increase their income, but to compete with other areas to "become models." Therefore, they did not calculate costs for the farmers and blindly mobilized them to invest excessively in the high-yield plots. This significantly increased production costs, and although yields increased, farmers' actual income decreased, even resulting in losses.

For example, the Wang Changlin mutual aid team in Baofeng County cultivated six mu of "high-yield land." In order to become a "model" and achieve high wheat yields, they blindly invested heavily: applying sixty cartloads of good manure, borrowing 540 jin of sesame cake fertilizer, and buying 200 jin of insecticide. They used 96 jin of wheat as densely planted seeds. The above totaled 1549 jin of wheat, with a cost of more than 258 jin per mu (labor and animal power for processing at more than double the amount was not included). This year, they actually harvested 1317 jin of wheat, an average of 219.5 jin per mu. Compared to the cost, they lost 38.5 jin per mu. However, local ordinary farmers apply three cartloads of manure (equivalent to 45 jin of wheat) and 12 jin of seeds per mu, totaling 57 jin. This year, although they only harvested 97 jin per mu, their net income after deducting costs was still 40 jin. Therefore, compared to the average wheat land of local farmers, the cost of one mu of high-yield land for the Wang Changlin mutual aid team could cultivate four to five mu of land.

Within the Wang Changlin mutual aid team, three elderly farmers had repeatedly suggested "distributing the manure more evenly" (because it was the communal fertilizer from the shared livestock troughs), but the cadres and activists criticized them for being "conservative." The result was that the "small-scale high-yield plot" lost money, and the large area of land also had reduced yields due to less manure being applied. The cost of the "small-scale high-yield plot" was shared equally by every member of the mutual aid team. They were extremely dissatisfied because they incurred debts because of this.

This is just one example. According to what is already known, such situations exist in every district of Lushan, Baofeng, Jia County, and Xiangcheng County. For example, in Guobai Township in Xiangcheng County, several mutual aid teams are also in debt because they lost money cultivating high-yield land. The local cadres' practice of not helping farmers improve their farming techniques to obtain the greatest harvest at the lowest cost, but instead blindly mobilizing farmers to cultivate high-yield land without calculating costs for them, has greatly harmed farmers' enthusiasm for production.

    许昌专区纠正盲目提倡种小块丰产地偏向
    河南省许昌专区在种“小块丰产地”中，曾发生了不计成本盲目投资的偏向，现正检查纠正中。种“小块丰产地”，有些地方曾收到过良好的效果，如鲁山苏殿选的十亩小麦，由于合理密植，每亩产量达四百五十斤；襄城县徐炳臣的二亩半丰产烟叶，由于改进了生产技术，每亩产量达五百七十六斤。像这些模范事例，对农民起了极大的示范作用。但有很多地方的干部，在“牲口合槽”的互助组和劳动模范、生产积极分子领导的互助组中，提倡种“小块丰产地”。他们的目的不是为了帮助农民提高生产，增加农民收入，而是为了和其他地方竞赛“当模范”，因此就不替农民计算成本，盲目地动员农民过多地向丰产地投资。这样生产成本大大增加，产量虽有提高，而农民实际收入却减少，甚至还有赔本的现象。
    例如宝丰县的王长林互助组，全组种有“丰产地”六亩，为了当“模范”，达到小麦高额丰产，盲目地大量投资：上好粪六十车，贷麻饼五百四十斤，买治虫药二百斤，密植种子用小麦九十六斤；以上合计折合小麦一千五百四十九斤，每亩化成本为二百五十八斤多，（人畜力加工在一倍以上不计算在内），今年实收小麦一千三百十七斤，每亩平均二百十九斤半。和成本相较，每亩赔了三十八斤半。而当地普通农民一亩地上三车粪（折小麦四十五斤），种子十二斤，共五十七斤，今年每亩虽然只收九十七斤，但扣除成本还可净收入四十斤。因此和当地农民一般麦地比较：王长林互助组一亩丰产地的成本，可种四五亩地。
    王长林互助组内，有三个老年农民，曾不止一次建议“把粪均开点上”（因为是全组牲口合槽的公有肥料），而干部和积极分子却批评他们“保守”。结果是，“小块丰产地”赔本，大面积土地也因少上粪而减产了。“小块丰产地”的成本是互助组内每个成员均摊的，他们为这事背了债务，感到极为不满。
    这仅仅是一个例子。据已了解的，在鲁山、宝丰、郏县、襄城县的每个区都有这种情况。如襄城县郭白乡，也有几个互助组因为种丰产地赔本而负债。当地干部这种不是帮助农民改善耕作技术，以最低的成本取得最大的收获，而是不替农民计算成本，盲目地动员农民种丰产地的作法，大大伤害了农民的生产积极性。    （中共许昌地委生产检查组）
