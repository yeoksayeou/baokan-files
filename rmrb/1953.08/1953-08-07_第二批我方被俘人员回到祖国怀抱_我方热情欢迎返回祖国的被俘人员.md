Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th—Today, 2,756 of our captured personnel being repatriated returned to the embrace of the motherland with even more激昂emotions. On the way from the U.S. side's repatriation station to our reception station, they unfurled many tarpaulins and military blankets on the trucks, with slogans written on them opposing the U.S. side's forced detention of prisoners of war and massacre of prisoners of war. Some stood on the vehicles waving the national flag, singing songs together with their returning comrades. They had been persecuted and slaughtered for singing these songs in the prisoner-of-war camps.

When the returning personnel got off the trucks in our reception area, most were wearing only a pair of shorts, having thrown away the tattered clothes issued to them by the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps along the way. However, they wore self-made hats with military emblems on their heads, neatly and properly. One returning personnel, lying on a stretcher and unable to turn around easily, knocked off his military cap when throwing away the clothing issued by the U.S. side. He struggled to pick up the hat and put it on. He said, "This military cap with the glorious symbol of the motherland is what we fought for with our blood in the prisoner-of-war camps."

Many of the returning personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were carried on stretchers or by others from the vehicles. They had been seriously ill for a long time, but the U.S. side's repatriation notification described them as "healthy." As soon as they arrived at our reception area, they angrily tore off their tattered clothes. When they saw the national flag of the motherland fluttering on the decorated archway with the inscription "Embrace of the Motherland" at the handover station, and our personnel warmly waving to them, they couldn't help but burst into tears. Some fell on their comrades, crying bitterly, "We finally got to see the flag of our motherland!" They also shouted loudly, "Thank you for the warm care of the people of the motherland!" They were sent to the reception station among the welcoming crowd.

Among the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army returning today were 358 wounded and sick personnel, including thirty who had been abused by the U.S. side into becoming mentally ill patients. They should have been repatriated during the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war this spring, but the U.S. side detained them until today without any reason.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th—On the first day of the official repatriation of prisoners of war, our side received 2,757 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, including 357 sick and wounded personnel.

When our captured personnel, who had suffered hardship and torment, arrived at our reception area and saw the decorated archway with the inscription "Embrace of the Motherland" and the bright 朝中 national flags, they cheered "Long Live" with tears in their eyes and sang revolutionary songs loudly. From the first vehicle to the last, the singing and slogans never stopped.

After they got off the vehicles, they were warmly welcomed by our personnel. Li Sang-cho General, Ding Guoyu General, members of our side of the Military Armistice Commission, and Du Ping General, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, personally came to the reception area to express their condolences. On the road from the reception area to the reception station, many Korean men and women held 朝中国 flags and flowers, calling out to and waving to the returning personnel. After entering the tents, the returning personnel underwent disinfection, had breakfast, got haircuts, took showers, changed into new clothes, and rested in the tents. The sick and wounded personnel were disinfected, given haircuts, and showered in the sanitary passage area before being immediately transferred to the hospital for treatment. Each returning personnel received a consolation bag, with the words "The People of the Motherland are Caring for You!" written in Korean and Chinese on the bag. It contained daily necessities such as towels, soap, and notebooks.

These returning captured personnel of our side were ragged and had a sickly look. Many were helped into the reception tents by our reception personnel. Our sick and wounded captured personnel were even more emaciated and pale. This was mainly due to prolonged overwork, malnutrition, and severe anemia, and also due to the torture they had suffered from the U.S. side, which they could not recover from in a short period of time. Although some of them had very serious injuries or illnesses, when they arrived at our reception station, they勉力 supported their bodies on stretchers and, like other returning personnel, took off every piece of clothing issued by the U.S. side and threw it on the ground.

After resting in the rest tents, the returning personnel went to the dining hall for lunch. One returning personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army excitedly said, "The food of the motherland is so fragrant!"

Many of the returning sick and wounded personnel had been ill or injured before the last exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war. For example, Shen Zepeng of the 12th Prisoner-of-War Camp on Koje Island was severely beaten by the U.S. side last December, resulting in complete paralysis of his lower body, but the U.S. side did not repatriate him during the last exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war. Another example is Choi Byeong-gi, whose right leg was about to become disabled, but the U.S. side said last time that his "injury was not serious" and did not allow him to be given priority for repatriation. Among them were also many sick and wounded personnel who became ill or injured due to abuse or severe torture by the U.S. side after the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners of war. For example, Woo Kwang-yeop was shot and wounded by a U.S. sentry when he went out to urinate on the night of July 8th. Even during this time when our captured personnel from the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps were arriving in Munsan, the U.S. side released poison gas shells on the vehicles simply because our captured personnel were singing patriotic songs, causing Lee Sang-bong and others to lose consciousness from poisoning. A returning personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army named Song Wanxi was burned by sulfur bombs fired by the U.S. side in the 8th Prisoner-of-War Camp on Jeju Island on July 28th. He could not walk at all and could not even sit. As soon as he saw our reception personnel, he burst into tears.

### 第二批我方被俘人员回到祖国怀抱  我方热情欢迎返回祖国的被俘人员

    第二批我方被俘人员回到祖国怀抱
    我方热情欢迎返回祖国的被俘人员
    【新华社开城六日电】今天被遣返的二千七百五十六名我方被俘人员怀着更加激昂的情绪回到了祖国的怀抱。从美方遣送站到我方接收站的途中，他们在卡车上展开许多雨布和军毯，上面写着反对美方强迫扣留战俘、虐杀战俘的标语。有的人站在车上挥舞着国旗，和归来的同伴们一齐高唱歌曲。他们曾经因为在战俘营里唱这些歌曲而遭受到迫害和屠杀。
    归来人员在我方接收区下车的时候，大都只穿着一条短裤，他们在路上就把美方战俘营发给他们的破烂衣服扔掉了。但是，他们头上却端端正正地戴着自制的佩着军徽的帽子。一位躺在担架上难以转身的归来人员，在把美方发给的衣物掷下地去时，碰掉了自己的军帽，他就尽力挣扎着把帽子拾起来戴上。他说：“这顶有祖国光荣标志的军帽，是我们在战俘营里用鲜血斗争得来的。”
    中国人民志愿军的归来人员，有许多是用担架、或由别人从车上背下来的，他们都是很久以来就身染重病，但在美方遣返通知里却把他们说成是“健康者”。他们一到我方接收区，就愤怒地撕下褴褛的衣服。他们望见在交接站的写有“祖国怀抱”横额的彩门上飘扬着的祖国的国旗，和我方人员热情向他们招手时，都忍不住热泪盈眶。有的人就倒在自己同志的身上痛哭说：“可挨到看见我们祖国的国旗了！”他们还高声喊：“感谢祖国人民的热情关怀！”他们在欢迎的人群中被送到招待站去。
    今日归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员中有三百五十八名伤病人员，其中有三十个是被美方虐待成了精神病患者的。他们本应在今年春天交换病伤战俘时就被遣返的，但美方却毫无理由地把他们一直扣留到今天。
     【新华社开城六日电】在正式遣返战俘的第一天，我方接回了二千七百五十七名朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员，其中包括三百五十七名
    病伤人员。
    当受尽了苦难和折磨的我方被俘人员到达我方接收区，看到写着“祖国怀抱”的彩门和灿烂的朝中国旗时，都含着泪水激动地欢呼万岁，高唱革命歌曲。从第一辆车到最后一辆车，歌声和口号声从未间断。
    他们下车以后，受到了我方人员的热情欢迎。以李相朝将军、丁国钰将军为首的我方军事停战委员会委员和中国人民志愿军政治部副主任杜平将军都亲自到接收区来慰问。在接收区到招待站的路上，有许多朝鲜男女人民拿着朝中国旗和鲜花向归来的人员呼唤、招手。归来人员进入帐篷后就进行消毒、用早点、理发、洗澡、换上新衣服到帐篷休息。病伤人员在卫生通过区消毒、理发、洗澡后便马上转送到医院治疗。每一个归来人员都领到一个慰问袋，袋上用朝文和中文写着：“祖国人民在关怀你们！”里面装有毛巾、肥皂、笔记本等日用品。
    这些归来的我方被俘人员衣衫褴褛，面有病容，许多人都是由我方接待人员搀扶着走进接收帐篷的。我方病伤被俘人员，更是身体消瘦，面色惨白。这主要是由于长期过度劳动，营养不良，患了严重的贫血症，并且由于受到美方的酷刑，在短期内不能恢复所致。他们之中虽然有些人伤势或病势很重，但是他们到达我方接收站时，就在担架上勉力支撑身体，和其他归来人员一样，把美方发的每件衣服脱下来，丢在地下。
    归来人员在休息帐篷憩息后，又到饭堂进午餐，一位中国人民志愿军归来人员兴奋地说：“祖国的饭真香啊！”
    归来的病伤人员中有好些人在上次交换病伤战俘以前就已患病或受伤，如巨济岛第十二收容所的沈泽鹏于去年十二月被美方毒打，以致下半身完全瘫痪，但在上次交换病伤战俘时，美方未予遣返；又如右腿将成残废的崔柄基，上次美方说他“伤势不重”，也不准他受优先遣返。其中也有许多病伤人员是在遣返病伤战俘后，遭受美方的虐待或严刑拷打致病致伤的，如禹光业在七月八日晚上出去小便被美方哨兵开枪射击而受伤。就在这次我方被俘人员自美方战俘营到达汶山途中，只因我方被俘人员高唱爱国歌曲，美方竟在汽车上施放毒气弹，致李相峰等人中毒失去了知觉。有一位名叫宋万喜的中国人民志愿军归来人员，七月二十八日在济州岛第八战俘营里被美方打的硫磺弹烧坏。根本不能走动，坐也不能坐。他一见我方接待人员后就失声痛哭起来。
