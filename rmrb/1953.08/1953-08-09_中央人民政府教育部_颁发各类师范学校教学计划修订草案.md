    Xinhua News Agency

    The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has promulgated revised draft teaching plans for various normal schools, stipulating that all types of normal schools nationwide will implement them on a trial basis starting in the autumn of 1953. The revised teaching plans align the sequence of general courses as closely as possible with that of middle schools. Simultaneously, they align with the subjects and hours stipulated in the teaching syllabi for mathematics, physics, and chemistry in normal schools issued by the Central Ministry of Education. The following adjustments have been made in terms of subject setup: The subject of Current Events and Policies has been eliminated from normal schools, kindergarten normal schools, and three-year junior normal schools. Trigonometry has been eliminated from normal schools and kindergarten normal schools, geometry has been increased by two hours (the geometry course includes trigonometry content), and human anatomy and physiology has been added. "Educational Visits and Practicals" has been renamed "Teaching Visits and Practicals." The teaching hours for each subject in various normal schools have also been appropriately adjusted based on actual needs.

    To prevent difficulties in teaching during the trial implementation period, the Central Ministry of Education has also formulated explanations for the 1953 autumn trial implementation of revised draft teaching plans for various normal schools. These explanations provide detailed information on changes in the subjects of various normal schools, as well as the teaching syllabi and materials that should be adopted or referenced during the trial implementation.
