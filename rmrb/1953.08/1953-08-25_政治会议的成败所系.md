The seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly resumed on the 17th of this month and began discussing the composition of the political conference. Whether this issue can be correctly and reasonably resolved is what the success or failure of the political conference hinges on.

China's Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai made an important statement on the issue of the political conference, advocating that the political conference should take the form of a round table conference, that is, a form of joint consultation between the two sides of the Korean armistice and other relevant countries, rather than a form of separate negotiations between the two sides of the Korean armistice. However, any resolution of the conference must be unanimously agreed by both sides of the Korean armistice before it can be established. Secondly, the scope of authority of the political conference should, in accordance with the provisions of Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, first consult on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and then discuss other issues. The statement expressed support for the proposal on the members of the political conference put forward by Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky at the UN General Assembly Political Committee on the 18th of this month, considering it to be in line with the above principles; and believing that any country that participated in the Korean War as part of the United Nations forces could be considered as a party to the armistice to participate in the conference. The principles put forward in Foreign Minister Zhou's statement are completely reasonable. Only a political conference composed according to these principles can hope to complete the task assigned to the political conference by Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement.

The proposal on the members of the political conference submitted by the Soviet delegation at the UN General Assembly Political Committee on the 18th of this month stated: "The General Assembly, in view of the need to ensure that the political conference proceeds smoothly in the most favorable circumstances, recommends convening a political conference to discuss the Korean issue, composed of the following members: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, the People' Republic of China, India, Poland, Sweden, Burma, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and South Korea. It must be stated that the decisions of the conference, if agreed upon by both parties signing the armistice agreement, shall be deemed to have been adopted." The basic spirit of this Soviet proposal once again fully embodies the Soviet Union's consistent foreign policy of supporting a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Because, people know that the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is closely related to the restoration of normal relations between the countries of the Far East and the consolidation of world peace. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the political conference to be attended not only by the two sides of the Korean armistice negotiations, but also by other relevant countries concerned with the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Conversely, if the political conference discussing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue does not absorb other relevant countries to participate, and still takes the form of the past Korean armistice negotiations with only the two sides holding separate negotiations, then it will be impossible to complete its task. In the past, the Korean armistice negotiations dragged on for more than two years, and if it were not for the persistent efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides, if it were not for the Soviet Union's active upholding of international justice, and if it were not for the pressure from countries concerned with the Korean issue on the United States, it would obviously have been difficult to reach an agreement. From this, it can be seen that merely having the two sides of the Korean armistice negotiations participate in the political conference cannot smoothly achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

It must be pointed out that this discussion of the Korean issue by the United Nations General Assembly is a new and important juncture for the United Nations. People hope that the United Nations can in the future begin to contribute to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, so as to restore the reputation of the United Nations and wash away the shame of its past use as a tool for the United States to wage a war of aggression against Korea. If the principles stated in the Soviet delegation's proposal can be adopted by the United Nations, then it will enable the United Nations to begin to return to the path of the United Nations Charter.

However, people are now seeing another diametrically opposed attitude taken by the US delegation at the United Nations General Assembly.

First, under the manipulation of the US delegation, the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee rejected the Soviet proposal to invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion, once again creating an extremely abnormal and unreasonable situation in the United Nations meeting, making it impossible for the DPRK and China, the two countries that facilitated the realization of the Korean armistice, to provide the most decisive opinions on the political conference issue at the United Nations General Assembly.

Although this arrogant attitude of the United States has been commonplace in the past, it is particularly worthy of attention today. Because the US delegation is pursuing a new mission, continuing to prevent the United Nations from contributing to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. From the very beginning, the US delegation has been trying its best to exaggerate that the United Nations is still an opposing party in the political conference, and to force the United Nations General Assembly to recognize this fact. Therefore, the US delegation is desperately opposing the Soviet proposal and opposing the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the members of the political conference according to the principles that are most conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. If people have not forgotten the recent facts that US reactionary groups representative Dulles and the Syngman Rhee group colluded in an attempt to sabotage the political conference and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea on a democratic basis, then people will more easily understand the true intentions of these arrogant practices of the US delegation. It turns out that the US reactionary groups are still attempting to continue to use the United Nations, which has been a tool for the US aggression against Korea for the past three years, to realize their sinister purpose of sabotaging the political conference.

The so-called "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" jointly put forward by the United States and other countries coerced into sending troops to invade Korea thoroughly exposed this despicable purpose of the US delegation. This proposal rigidly limits the members of the political conference to the hostile "two sides" of the Korean War, while excluding other important countries concerned with the Korean issue, in order to conduct so-called face-to-face negotiations between the hostile "two sides." Obviously, if the political conference is such a conference, then it is only Panmunjom negotiations the second, not a higher-level political conference in form and substance. Anyone can see that this kind of Panmunjom-style meeting between the hostile parties is only suitable for negotiations aimed at seeking a cessation of war, and not suitable for discussing a conference for the peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue. Moreover, the Korean issue to be resolved by the political conference and its success or failure are related to peace in the Far East and the world. Therefore, there is no reason to impose unreasonable restrictions on its composition and conference form, so that other relevant countries concerned with Korea and peace in the Far East and the world cannot provide their useful opinions. Therefore, if the United States is truly sincere in enabling the political conference to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue based on the interests of the Korean people and the countries related to the Korean issue, then there is no reason to refuse the participation of relevant countries other than the two sides of the Korean armistice in the political conference.

However, in order to defend their unreasonable position, the US representatives went so far as to distort the provisions of Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement unilaterally, clinging to the concept of "both sides" as a pretext for excluding other countries from participating in the political conference. This is a completely untenable sophistry. Because the original text of Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement neither stipulates that the representatives of both sides participating in the political conference are limited to the countries that actually participated in the war, nor does it have any words that can be interpreted as only the countries that participated in the war can be nominated by both sides as representatives to the political conference. According to the US representatives' distortion of the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, it is actually equivalent to saying that the conference convened under Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement is not a higher-level political conference at all, but still another Panmunjom meeting. Can there be such a bizarre thing in the world? The unreasonableness of the US delegation's proposition can be understood by anyone. No wonder even the representatives of the United Kingdom and France, the proposers of the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal," now believe that Article 60 should not be interpreted too narrowly, and the political conference should not be a meeting of the warring parties.

The US wants to limit the political conference to a meeting of the two sides of the Korean armistice entirely to facilitate its manipulation and sabotage of the political conference with the Syngman Rhee group. Dulles and Syngman Rhee have both expressed their intention to withdraw from the political conference within a predetermined period and implement new adventurous policies. Now, the United States is preparing conditions for this sinister plan, which is no longer a secret.

The US delegation does not want the United Nations to make useful arrangements for the membership of the political conference in order to facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This is particularly evident in its attempt to exclude the Soviet Union from participating in the political conference and its stubborn opposition to India's participation until now. This is obviously unreasonable. Representatives from the United Kingdom and many other countries also believe that excluding the Soviet Union from participating in the political conference is unrealistic, and opposing India, a country that has made important contributions to the cessation of the Korean War, is also unfair. Lodge and Wiley and the like, with their mouths full of words, use the Soviet Union's consistent opposition to the US aggression against Korea and its advocacy of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and India's failure to send troops to Korea, as excuses to refuse the Soviet Union and India to participate in the political conference. But they clearly know that the Korean War has ended with the defeat of the US aggressors. Now, the United Nations is discussing which major countries with direct relations should participate in the political conference to discuss a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Therefore, at this time, the loudest reputation obviously does not belong to the shameful aggressors. What is particularly surprising is that when defending its isolated proposition, the US representative even dragged out a zombie that is only favored by the US aggressive group -- the remnant gang of the Kuomintang in Taiwan -- to make a threat, saying that if India and other countries can participate in the political conference, then this zombie should also "not be ignored." But this kind of gangster-style threat can only expose the fact that the US is playing the "power politics" card on the international political stage, and it is about to lose all its capital.

The matter is very clear. If the US attempt to manipulate the political conference succeeds, it will only lead to the failure of the political conference, and the United Nations will continue to degenerate into a tool for new military adventures. Therefore, peace-loving people all over the world, and all countries willing to promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, must oppose this scheme of the US aggressive group and prevent it from being realized under the guise of the United Nations.

The Chinese people will make unremitting efforts to promote the smooth convening of the political conference on a sound and reasonable organizational basis, and hope that the United Nations General Assembly can make a reasonable proposal on the political conference issue based on the principles put forward by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. As long as it is reasonable, the Chinese people and government will give it serious consideration and use it as the basis for holding the political conference.

### 政治会议的成败所系

    政治会议的成败所系
    联合国第七届大会已于本月十七日复会，开始讨论政治会议的组成问题。这个问题是否能够正确地合理地解决，乃是政治会议的成败之所系。
    我国外交部长周恩来对于政治会议问题发表了重要声明，主张政治会议应采取圆桌会议的形式，即朝鲜停战双方在其他有关国家参加之下共同协商的形式，而不采取朝鲜停战双方单独谈判的形式，但会议的任何决议，必须得到朝鲜停战双方的一致同意，才能成立；其次，政治会议的职权范围，应根据朝鲜停战协定第六十款的规定，先行协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，及和平解决朝鲜问题，然后再讨论其他问题。声明对于苏联代表团团长维辛斯基在本月十八日的联大政治委员会上所提出的关于政治会议的成员的提案表示支持，认为是符合于上述原则的；并认为凡以军队参加联合国军在朝鲜进行战争的国家，可被考虑作为停战的一方参加会议。周外长声明所提出的这些原则，是完全合理的。只有根据这些原则组成的政治会议才有希望能够完成停战协定第六十款所赋予政治会议的任务。
    在本月十八日的联大政治委员会上苏联代表团提出的关于政治会议的成员的提案说：“大会鉴于有必要保证政治会议在最有利的情况下顺利进行其工作，建议召开讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议，由下列成员组成：美国、英国、法国、苏联、中华人民共和国、印度、波兰、瑞典、缅甸、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜。必须说明，会议的决议如果得到了签订停战协定双方的同意，即作为通过。”苏联这个提案的基本精神，又一次充分地体现了苏联一贯支持和平解决朝鲜问题的外交政策。因为，人们知道，朝鲜问题的和平解决，与恢复远东各国的正常关系和巩固世界和平有密切的关联。因此，政治会议不仅要由朝鲜停战谈判的双方参加，还应由其他关心和平解决朝鲜问题的有关国家参加，这是完全必要的。相反地，如果讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的政治会议，不吸收其他有关国家参加，仍然是像过去朝鲜停战谈判的形式仅由双方单独举行谈判，那就不可能完成它的任务。过去朝鲜停战谈判，拖延了两年多的时间，如果不是因为朝中方面的坚持努力，如果没有苏联积极主持国际正义，如果没有关心朝鲜问题的各国对美国的压力，就显然很难取得协议。由此可见，仅仅由朝鲜停战谈判的双方参加政治会议，是不能顺利达到朝鲜问题的和平解决的。
    必须指出，联合国大会这次讨论朝鲜问题，对联合国来说，是一个新的重要关头。人们希望联合国能在今后开始对和平解决朝鲜问题有所贡献，以便恢复联合国的声望，洗刷它过去成为美国进行侵朝战争的工具的耻辱。苏联代表团的提案所申述的原则，如果能得到联合国采纳，那末，就会使联合国开始回到联合国宪章的道路上来。
    但是，现在人们又看到了美国代表团在联合国大会上所采取的另一种截然相反的态度。
    首先在美国代表团的操纵下，联合国大会政治委员会否决了苏联关于邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表和中华人民共和国的代表参加讨论的建议，又一次造成联合国会议极端不正常和不合理的情况，使得促成朝鲜停战实现的朝中两国竟不能在联合国大会上对政治会议问题提供最有决定性的意见。
    美国这种蛮横态度虽然在过去已是司空见惯的了，但今天特别值得人们注意。因为，美国代表团正在奉行一种新的任务，继续不让联合国对和平解决朝鲜问题有所贡献。美国代表团一开始就竭力渲染联合国依然是政治会议中的敌对一方，并要强迫联合国大会承认这个事实。因此，美国代表团拚命反对苏联的提案，反对联合国大会根据最有利于和平解决朝鲜问题的原则来讨论政治会议的成员问题。如果人们没有忘记最近美国反动集团的代表杜勒斯与李承晚集团进行预谋，企图破坏政治会议，阻挠在民主基础上和平统一朝鲜等等事实的话，那末，人们就会更容易理解到美国代表团这些蛮横做法的真正意图。原来美国反动集团仍在企图使过去三年来成为美国侵略朝鲜的战争工具的联合国，继续被利用来实现他们破坏政治会议的阴险目的。
    美国胁迫出兵侵朝的其他国家共同提出了一个所谓“十五国提案”，实际上就彻头彻尾地暴露了美国代表团的这个卑劣目的。这个提案硬把组成政治会议的成员局限于朝鲜战争的敌对“双方”国家，而把关心朝鲜问题的其他重要国家排斥在外，以进行所谓敌对“双方”的面对面的谈判。很显然，政治会议如果是这样一个会议的话，那末它在形式上和实质上都只不过是板门店谈判第二，而不是高一级的政治会议。任何人都可以看出，这种板门店式的敌对双方的会议只能适用于旨在谋求停止战争的谈判，而不适于讨论和平解决整个朝鲜问题的会议。何况，政治会议所要解决的朝鲜问题和它的成败都关系着远东及世界的和平，因而没有任何理由把它的组成和会议形式强加以无理的限制，而使关心朝鲜以及远东与世界和平的其他有关国家，不能提供它们的有益的意见。因此，如果美国真正有诚意使政治会议能够根据朝鲜人民以及与朝鲜问题有着关系的国家的利益，谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，那就没有理由拒绝朝鲜停战双方以外的有关国家参加政治会议。
    然而，美国代表为了辩护他们的无理立场，竟至不惜片面地曲解朝鲜停战协定第六十款的条文，死咬住其中“双方”概念不放，作为他们排斥其他国家参加政治会议的藉口。这完全是不值一驳的诡辩。因为，停战协定第六十款的原文，既没有规定参加政治会议的双方代表只限于实际参加战争的各国，同时也没有任何词句可以解释为只有参加战争的国家才能被双方提名为政治会议的代表。如果按照美国代表对停战协定条文的曲解，实际上就等于说停战协定第六十款所规定召开的根本不是什么高一级的政治会议，而依然是另一个板门店的会议。天下难道会有这样离奇的事情？美国代表团这个主张的不合理，是什么人都能懂得的。难怪就连“十五国提案”的提案人英、法两国代表，现在也认为不应该把第六十款解释得太偏狭，政治会议不应该成为作战双方的会议了。
    美国想把政治会议局限于朝鲜停战双方的会议的目的，完全是为了便利它和李承晚集团操纵和破坏政治会议。杜勒斯和李承晚都曾表示过他们要在一个预定的期间退出政治会议，实行新的冒险政策。现在，美国正在为这个罪恶计划准备条件，这已经不是什么秘密了。
    美国代表团不想使联合国对政治会议的成员问题作有益的安排，以便有利于和平解决朝鲜问题，这特别明显地表现在它竟曾企图排斥苏联参加政治会议，并且直到现在仍顽固地反对印度参加。这显然是没有道理的。英国和其他许多国家的代表也认为排斥苏联参加政治会议是不现实的，反对印度这个曾对停止朝鲜战争作出了重要贡献的国家参加也是不公正的。洛奇和维利之流，口口声声以苏联一贯反对美国侵略朝鲜、主张和平解决朝鲜问题，和印度没有派遣军队到朝鲜，作为拒绝苏联和印度参加政治会议的藉口。但他们明明知道朝鲜战争已以美国侵略者的失败而告终，现在，联合国是在讨论那些有直接关系的主要国家应该参加政治会议讨论和平解决朝鲜问题，因此，在这个时候，最响亮的声名显然绝对不是属于可耻的侵略者了。尤其令人惊奇的是，美国代表在为自己孤立的主张辩护时，还拖出只有美国侵略集团才加以宠爱的一副僵尸——台湾国民党残余匪帮来作要挟，说什么如果印度等国可以参加政治会议，那末，对这副僵尸也“不应当忽略”。但这种流氓式的要挟，只能暴露出美国在国际政治舞台上玩弄“实力政策”的本钱，已快要输光了。
    事情摆得很明白，如果美国企图操纵政治会议的阴谋计划得逞，那就只能导致政治会议的失败，联合国也将继续堕落成为新的军事冒险的工具。因此，全世界爱好和平的人民，和所有愿意促成朝鲜问题和平解决的国家，都必须反对美国侵略集团的这个计谋，不使它在联合国的掩盖下实现。
    中国人民将以不懈的努力来促成政治会议在健全合理的组织基础上顺利召开，并希望联合国大会能根据我国周恩来外长提出的原则，对政治会议问题做出合理的议案。而只要它是合理的，我国人民和政府就将加以郑重考虑并把它作为举行政治会议的基础。
