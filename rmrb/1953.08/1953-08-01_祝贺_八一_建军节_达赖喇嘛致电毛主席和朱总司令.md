    Congratulations on the "August 1st" Army Day
    The Dalai Lama Sends a Telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
    To the great Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
	The Chinese People's Liberation Army, under your leadership, has struggled against Japanese and American imperialism and the bandit troops of the Kuomintang reactionaries for twenty-six years, overcoming tremendous difficulties, and finally liberated all ethnic groups throughout the country from the shackles of foreign imperialism and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government, achieving great and close unity among all fraternal ethnic groups. Now, on the Korean battlefield, the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, have achieved a great victory in the battle against American imperialism and the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang, forcing them to sign a military armistice agreement, thereby making people clearly aware of the strength of China and the world's forces for peace. For this, with infinite excitement, I extend my sincere gratitude and warm congratulations to the great Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The Chinese People's Liberation Army in Tibet has also strengthened the unity between the Tibetan local government and the monks and lay people with its exemplary discipline and fine style, making us realize that the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet is the army of the Tibetan monks and lay people themselves, and is making great efforts to consolidate national defense. On the occasion of the 26th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day of the People's Liberation Army, I respectfully extend my sincere congratulations to you.
    Dalai Lama of the Tibetan Local Government
