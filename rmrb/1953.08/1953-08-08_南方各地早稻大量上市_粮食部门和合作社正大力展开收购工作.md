Large Quantities of Early Rice are on the Market in Various Southern Regions; Grain Departments and Cooperatives are Vigorously Expanding Procurement Work
[This newspaper's report] Early rice has generally and extensively entered the market in various regions of southern China. Grain departments and cooperatives in various regions are vigorously expanding procurement work. From July 1st to July 23rd, Guangdong Province has procured approximately 110 million jin of new rice (converted to polished rice); on July 24th alone, over 17 million jin were procured. Hunan Province, particularly the area along Dongting Lake, has seen the largest influx of new rice. For example, in Nan County, the procurement volume on July 27th more than doubled compared to July 24th, exceeding the same period last year by more than 45%. In Hunan Province as a whole, the procurement volume from July 21st to 25th increased by 48% compared to the previous five days. In Anhui Province, the Wuhu Special District has seen the largest influx of new rice, with 780,000 jin entering the market throughout the district on July 27th; Wuhu City saw over 130,000 jin enter the market on July 28th. In Hubei Province, along with the new rice entering the market, stockpiled grain from rural areas is also flooding the market. For example, on July 25th, the province procured 2 million jin of rice, half of which was stockpiled grain; after July 27th, the amount of new and stockpiled grain entering the market generally increased by 30% compared to July 25th. From July 17th to 19th, Jiangxi Province procured 2.53 million jin of new rice. In other regions such as Fujian, Zhejiang, and parts of Sichuan, new rice is also entering the market in succession. As of July 27th, the grain departments' procurement plans for July were as follows: the Southwest Region had completed 248.15%; the East China Region had completed 172.05%; and the Central South Region had completed 68.11%. Due to the large influx of new rice, the sales volume of polished rice in various regions has gradually decreased. For example, comparing the average daily sales volume of polished rice in late July with mid-July, the East China Region decreased by 16.16%, and the Southwest Region decreased by 23.21%.

After the new rice entered the market, grain departments in various regions, when setting up procurement points, have strived to make it convenient for farmers and meet their needs. For example, Changde Special District in Hunan alone has established 387 procurement points; Xiangtan Special District has established 574 procurement points; and the three regions of eastern, central, and northern Guangdong Province have established 984 procurement points. Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, and other provinces have also signed entrusted procurement contracts with cooperatives. Anhui Province has also stipulated that the proportion of cooperative procurement should account for approximately 60% to 70% of the total procurement volume. Simultaneously, various regions have strengthened market management, establishing market management committees and exchanges in key markets. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Commerce stipulates that all public and private factories and businesses, as well as general organizations, groups, and schools, within and outside the province, that need to purchase rice, polished rice, soybeans, and corn must first submit a procurement plan to the local industry and commerce administration department for review and approval. Similar regulations have also been implemented in Wuxi and other markets in Jiangsu Province. Therefore, the procurement proportion of grain departments and cooperatives in various regions generally accounts for over 80% of the market volume.

Because Party committees and People's Governments at all levels have attached importance to this year's new rice procurement work and made preparations in advance, and because the procurement price of early rice is generally higher than last year, farmers have responded favorably and are actively selling rice. State-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives in various regions should cooperate with rice procurement and vigorously strengthen the supply of means of production and means of subsistence.

    南方各地早稻大量上市
    粮食部门和合作社正大力展开收购工作
    【本报讯】我国南方各地早稻已普遍大量上市，各地粮食部门和合作社正在大力展开收购工作。广东省从七月一日起到二十三日止，已收购新稻（折大米）约一亿一千万斤；七月二十四日一天即收进一千七百余万斤。新稻上市最多的是湖南省沿洞庭湖一带。如南县在七月二十七日收购数较二十四日增加一倍多，比去年同期增加百分之四十五强。湖南全省七月二十一日到二十五日的收购数量较前五日增加百分之四十八。安徽省以芜湖专区新稻上市最多，七月二十七日全专区上市新稻七十八万斤，芜湖市七月二十八日即上市十三万余斤。湖北省与新稻上市同时，农村陈谷亦大量涌向市场，如七月二十五日全省收购稻谷二百万斤，其中陈谷即占一半；二十七日以后新、陈谷上市一般又较二十五日增加百分之三十。江西省从七月十七日到十九日已收购新稻二百五十三万斤。其他如福建、浙江及四川部分地区，新稻也纷纷上市。到七月二十七日止，粮食部门七月份的收购计划：西南区已完成百分之二百四十八·一五；华东区已完成百分之一百七十二·○五；中南区已完成百分之六十八·一一。由于新稻大量上市，各地粮食部门大米销量已逐渐下降。如以七月下旬大米平均日销量与七月中旬比较，华东区减少百分之一十六·一六，西南区减少百分之二十三·二一。
    新稻上市后，各地粮食部门在设置收购点时，尽量作到使农民方便，满足农民要求。如湖南仅常德专区就设收购点三百八十七处；湘潭专区设收购点五百七十四处；广东省粤东、粤中、粤北三地区就设收购点九百八十四处。江西、福建、安徽等省并与合作社签订了委托代购合同，安徽省还规定合作社代购比重应占总收购量百分之六十到七十左右。与此同时，各地并加强了市场管理，在重点市场都成立了市场管理委员会和交易所。浙江省商业厅规定，凡省内外公私厂商及一般机关、团体、学校，如需采购稻谷、大米、黄豆、玉米的，必需先交采购计划，经当地工商行政部门审查批准，江苏省无锡等地市场也作了上述规定。因此，各地粮食部门及合作社收购比重一般都占上市量百分之八十以上。
    由于各级党委和人民政府重视今年新稻收购工作，事先作了准备，且早稻收购价格一般又较去年提高，农民反映良好，纷纷出售稻谷。各地国营商业和合作社，应配合收购稻谷，大力加强对生产资料和生活资料的供应工作。
