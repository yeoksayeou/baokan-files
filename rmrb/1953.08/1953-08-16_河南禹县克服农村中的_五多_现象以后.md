After Yuxian County, Henan Province, Overcomes the "Five Excesses" Phenomenon in Rural Areas
Yang Hengshan

    In the past, the Yuxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party relied solely on meetings to lead its work. In March, the county leadership spent twenty-seven days holding six large-scale meetings, with nearly three thousand participants. A large number of tasks were assigned at these meetings, mostly with short deadlines and high demands, but little specific guidance was given. So many tasks caused chaos at the township level. In order to convey the county's decisions and arrange district and village work, many more meetings had to be held. As a result, Huashi Township in the Fourth District held more than seventy meetings in March alone. The district's propaganda committee member and the township head convened five meetings in a single day, keeping the masses from sleeping at night and preventing them from producing during the day.

    Of course, the occurrence of this situation in Yuxian County was also inseparable from the bureaucratic style of the higher authorities, who did not understand the rural situation and thought that a mere order could make millions of small producers obey their commands. For example, this year the Xuchang Prefectural Commissioner's Office assigned Yuxian County to dig ten thousand wells (later reduced by five thousand). However, Yuxian County was supposed to build a large canal in coordination with the Baisha Reservoir project this winter, which could irrigate hundreds of thousands of acres of land. Once this canal was completed, the vast majority of the plains could be irrigated. On the other hand, it was generally impossible to dig wells in the mountains to get water. In order to complete the well-digging task, Yuxian County cadres had to force the allocation. Later, the central government issued instructions against bureaucracy, and this work was stopped.

    After studying the central government's instructions and summing up the experiences and lessons learned from the work in the first half of the year, the Yuxian County Committee criticized the subjective and decentralized work style of the leading cadres, changed the work style of relying solely on holding large meetings and giving reports, and the county committee members and other main leading cadres went deep into the lower levels to provide specific guidance on rural work. In April, Yuxian County's wheat fields suffered severe frost damage. The county committee organized two hundred cadres to go to the countryside, deeply into the disaster areas, to ascertain the extent of the disaster, stabilize the emotions of the masses, and launch a disaster relief and seedling protection campaign. Ge Xin, the deputy secretary of the county committee, held a forum with farmers in Xutun Township in the Fourth District to discuss methods of watering wheat, applying fertilizer, and protecting seedlings, reversing the idea of destroying wheat among the farmers, and mobilizing the masses to water more than 2,700 mu of wheat, and many wheat fields were also fertilized. During this wheat protection work, Yuxian County farmers watered and fertilized a total of more than 30,000 mu, enabling the county's wheat to achieve 70% of the harvest. At the same time, the county committee led the county's farmers to sow one million mu of autumn grain crops, and universally carried out seedling inspection and replanting, reversing the ideas among the masses of "autumn is a hole, not much harvest" and "missing seedlings, doesn't matter" through careful accounting. This ensured full seedlings in general autumn fields. In this way, at least ten more kilograms of grain could be produced per mu, and it is estimated that the county could produce at least ten million kilograms of grain more.

    After the Yuxian County Committee changed its leadership methods and leadership style, the number of meetings in the county, districts, and townships was reduced. They also made strict regulations on meetings: no large-scale meetings were allowed during the day in the busy farming season, and mass meetings at night had to be approved by the district committee. It was also emphasized that meetings should be well prepared and short in duration. This gave farmers plenty of time for production and rest. With the "five excesses" phenomenon overcome, the work stoppages of township cadres were also greatly reduced. Many areas' township cadres adopted a "rotational half-day duty system" work method, with semi-detached township cadres generally losing no more than seven days of work per month, and non-detached main township cadres losing no more than five days, so they changed from "suffering from all sides" (criticism from superiors for poor work, complaints from home for poor production, opposition from the masses for too many meetings) to "satisfaction from all sides." In the past, Huashi Township had six or seven people dedicated to delivering official documents and forms to the district every day, but now this situation no longer exists.

    To completely overcome the "five excesses" phenomenon, the leadership must also establish a new set of working methods. In the early stage of overcoming the "five excesses" phenomenon in Yuxian County, some district and township cadres, because the method of relying on meetings to do work was no longer feasible, and there was no new working method, did not know how to do work. Some district cadres, after going to the countryside, only "ate, slept, and produced." After discovering this situation, the county committee organized cadres to study the working methods of Ren Guodong, the secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Committee; at the same time, leading cadres personally went deep into the lower levels to create experience; and gradually improved everyone's working level.

    At present, there are still some problems in Yuxian County's work. For example, in the opposition to the "five excesses," some cadres developed the emotion of negating everything in the past, not holding meetings that should be held, not writing necessary reports, and not doing work that should be done. Some comrades regarded statistics on disaster-stricken households and relief to disaster victims as "five excesses," and regarded feasible health work as an extra burden. In some areas (such as Shangwangzhuang Township in the Fourth District), the township government is often locked, and no one is in charge of all work. To change this situation, the leaders of Yuxian County must make clear explanations to the district and township cadres, using specific examples, on what the "five excesses" are, what is necessary work, and what is the correct working method.

    河南禹县克服农村中的“五多”现象以后
    杨恒珊
    中共河南禹县县委过去是只靠开会来领导工作的。三月份县领导机关费了二十七天时间，开了六个大会，参加的人数将近三千。在这些会上布置了一大套工作，大都是限期短、要求高，但却很少交代具体办法。这么多任务，到了乡里就乱成一团了。要传达县上的决定和布置区村工作，又得开很多会。四区花石乡为此在三月份一个月内开了七十多个会。区委宣传委员和乡长，一天就召集了五个会，开得群众黑夜不能睡觉，白天不能生产。
    当然，禹县这种情况的发生也和上级的官僚主义作风是分不开的，他们不了解农村情况，以为靠一纸命令就能够使千千万万的小生产者听从自己的指挥。例如今年许昌专署分配禹县要打一万眼井，
    （后来减去了五千眼）。但禹县今冬配合白沙水库工程要开一条能灌溉数十万亩田地的大渠。这条渠开成后，绝大多数的平原地就可引水灌溉了。另方面山地打井一般都打不出水来。禹县干部为了要完成打井任务，就只好强迫分配。后来中央发出了反对官僚主义的指示，这个工作才停止。
    禹县县委学习了中央各项指示后，总结了上半年工作的经验教训，批判了领导干部的主观主义、分散主义的工作作风，改变了只靠开大会作报告的工作作风，县委委员和其他主要领导干部都深入了下层，具体地指导农村工作。四月份禹县麦田受了严重霜灾，县委组织了二百名干部下乡，深入灾区，查明灾情，安定群众情绪，开展了救灾保苗运动。县委副书记革新同志在四区许屯乡与农民举行座谈，讨论浇麦追肥保苗的方法，扭转了农民中的毁麦思想，发动群众浇麦二千七百多亩，还有不少麦田施了追肥。在这次保麦工作中，禹县农民浇麦施肥共三万余亩，使全县麦子获得了七成收成。与此同时，县委领导全县农民播种了秋季粮食作物一百万亩，并普遍进行了查苗补苗，通过算细账，扭转了群众中存在的“窟窿秋、不少收”“缺成苗、不算啥”的思想。使一般的秋田都保证了全苗。这样每亩地最少可以多产十斤粮，估计全县最少可以增产一千万斤粮食。
    禹县县委改变领导方法和领导作风以后，县区乡的会议都减少了。他们对会议还作了严格的规定：在农忙季节白天不许开大会，夜间开群众大会也要经过区委同意。并强调开会要有充分准备，时间要短。这就使农民有了充分的时间生产和休息。“五多”现象克服了，乡干部的误工也大大减少了。不少地区的乡干部采取了“轮流值班半日制”的工作方法，半脱离生产的乡干部每月误工一般不超过七天，不脱离生产的主要乡干部也不超过五天，因此他们由“三面受气”（工作搞不好上级批评，生产搞不好家里埋怨，开会多群众反对）变成“三面满意”了。过去花石乡每天要有六、七个人专门替区上送公文、表格，现在已经没有这种情形了。
    要彻底地克服“五多”现象，领导方面还必须建立一套新的工作方法。禹县在克服“五多”现象初期，有些区乡干部由于靠开会作工作的办法吃不开了，新的工作方法又没有，不知道该怎么样做工作，有的区干部下乡后，光是“吃饭、睡觉、生产”。县委发现这种情况以后，就组织干部学习肇源县委书记任国栋的工作方法；同时，领导干部亲自深入下层，创造经验；逐步提高大家的工作水平。
    目前禹县的工作还存在一些问题。如在反对“五多”中，部分干部产生了否定过去的一切的情绪，该开的会不开了，必要的报告也不写了，该作的工作也不作了，有的同志把统计受灾户数、救济灾民也当成了“五多”，把可行的卫生工作也当成额外负担。部分地区的（如四区上王庄乡）乡政府经常锁着门，一切工作没人管。要改变这种情况，禹县领导方面还必须把什么是“五多”，什么是必要的工作，和什么是正确的工作方法，应用具体的事例向区乡干部进行明白的解释。
