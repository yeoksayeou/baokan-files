    Local People's Governments Should Handle with Caution the Issue of Military Dependents Traveling to Find Their Children
    Reader Xiang Qian writes: I returned from Korea this April, and on my way back to Sichuan via Shenyang, Beijing, Wuhan, and other places, I learned that many military dependents are blindly going out to find their children, creating many difficulties.
    On the ship from Wuhan to Yichang, there were a total of twenty-five passengers, and twelve of them were military dependents going to Sichuan to visit their children. Among them was Han Yuhua (female), 32 years old, a military dependent from Yangjiazhai Village, Twelfth District, Lin County, Henan Province, who was leading her 70-plus-year-old mother and a child under three years old, carrying one million yuan (obtained from selling grain and borrowing) to see her husband, Yang Jiaxiang, at a certain unit in Chongqing. However, her husband had written to her last December saying that he would be leaving for Tibet in January of this year. They came out regardless of whether he was still in Chongqing or not, and the village chief, Yang Jiagui, also wrote a letter of introduction. On the ship, the old mother asked me: How far is Tibet? I said: The road is very long, the mountains are high and the road is steep, you can't go now. She burst into tears. There was also a military dependent named Deng Yongchang (male), 21 years old, from Linquan County, Anhui Province. He only had a grandfather at home, who died of illness this spring. The wheat in his hometown was also completely destroyed by frost this spring. Seeing that life was temporarily difficult, the village chief scraped together 300,000 yuan for travel expenses and told him to go to Chengdu to "make a living" with his uncle, Deng Huiyun, in the army. On the ship, he didn't even have money to eat, and the ship took special care of him. The local People's Government also solved his travel expenses from Yichang to Wanxian. Even if he can reach his uncle's place, how can a military dependent rashly go to the army to "make a living" like this? Many of the military dependents on that ship brought some dry food from home to eat on the way, but they were still eating it even when it was moldy. Some even only ate one meal every one or two days. Some didn't bring quilts and slept naked. I was even reminded of an old military dependent from Cao County, Shandong Province, over sixty years old, who sold his livestock and grain last year and scraped together 1.5 million yuan to take his daughter-in-law to Sichuan to see his son. After arriving in Chongqing, they learned that their son had gone to Tibet, and their money was also used up. With the help of the People's Government, they were able to return home. However, the livestock and grain were sold, and production and life became a problem. Even more unfortunate, there was an old military dependent from the Northeast who took her daughter-in-law to Hainan Island to see her son. After seeing him, they prepared to go home, but when crossing the sea, she kept looking back at her son and accidentally fell into the sea and drowned.
    Based on the above situation, I suggest: 1. The village People's Governments in various regions should carefully examine the letters from relevant troops and the actual situation of military dependents who go out to find their children, and must not adopt the attitude of "sending them out and being done with it." Doing so is seemingly taking care of military dependents, but in fact, it makes things difficult for them, affects production, and causes unnecessary losses to the state. For military dependents whose conditions do not permit going out, the advantages and disadvantages should be explained and patiently dissuaded; for those whose conditions permit going out, detailed letters of introduction or passports should be issued, and sufficient travel expenses and necessary clothing should be prepared. 2. Military personnel themselves, if conditions permit, should inform visiting family members in detail about the return routes and contact information in advance. If conditions do not permit, they must not blindly notify them to leave home, causing unnecessary trips, resulting in many unnecessary accidents and losses. 3. Relevant People's Governments, hostels, public security personnel, and employees of vehicles and ships along the way should take good care of the military dependents who are traveling, helping them get on and off vehicles and ships, asking for directions, buying tickets, dealing with illnesses, and addressing genuine difficulties.

### 各地人民政府应慎重处理军属外出找子弟的问题

专栏：读者来信摘要

    各地人民政府应慎重处理军属外出找子弟的问题
    读者向前来信：今年四月间我由朝鲜回国，经沈阳、北京、武汉等地回四川途中，知道有很多军人家属盲目外出找子弟，产生很多困难。
    我由武汉到宜昌的轮船上，乘客共二十五人，而要到四川访子弟的军属就有十二位。其中一位是河南省林县十二区杨家寨村的军属韩玉花（女），三十二岁，领着七十多岁的母亲和一个不满三岁的孩子，带了一百万元（卖粮食得的和借的），要到重庆某部队去看她的丈夫杨家祥。但她丈夫在去年十二月里曾经给她信说：今年一月要出发去西藏。她们不管他到底还在不在重庆就出来了，村长杨家贵也写了介绍信。在船上，老母亲问我：去西藏有多远？我说：路很远，山高路陡，你现在不能去。她哭起来了。还有一位军属邓永昌（男），二十一岁，安徽省临泉县人。他家里只有祖父，今春病死了。他家乡今春的小麦又全被霜打死。眼见生活暂时有困难，村长就凑了三十万元路费，叫他到成都部队上他叔父邓徽云处“谋生”。在船上他连吃饭的钱都没有了，船上特别照顾他。他从宜昌到万县的路费，也是由所在地人民政府给解决的。即使他能到达他叔父处，试问一个军属怎么能这样贸然到部队去“谋生”呢？在那船上的军属们很多都由家里带了些干粮在途中吃，但干粮发霉了还在吃。有的一天甚至两天才吃一顿饭。有的没带被子，光着身子睡觉。我更想起：山东省曹县一位军属老大爷，六十多岁，去年他把牲口、粮食卖了，凑了一百五十万元，领着他儿媳奔四川看儿子，他们到重庆后才知道儿子已去西藏，而他们的钱也用光了。在人民政府帮助下，他们才又回到家里。但牲口、粮食卖光了，生产和生活都成了问题。更不幸的，是东北有位军属老大娘，领着儿媳去海南岛看儿子，看后准备回家了，但过海时，不时回头看她儿子，没注意掉下海淹死了。
    根据以上情况，我建议：一、各地区村人民政府对外出找子弟的军属，应慎重审查有关部队的来信和军属的实际情况，决不可采取“送出门了事”的态度。那样做，表面是照顾军属，其实是使军属作难，影响生产，造成国家不应有的损失。对条件不许可外出的军属，应说明利害，耐心劝阻；对条件许可外出的，应详细开明路条或护照，并筹好足够旅费和应用衣物等。二、军人本身对来访家属，条件许可的，事先应详细告诉往返道路和联络关系。条件不许可的，切不可盲目通知离家，徒使往返，以致造成很多不应有的事故和损失。三、沿途有关人民政府、招待所、公安人员和车船员工，对外出军属的上下车船、问路、买票、疾病以及确实的困难等等，应该好好照顾。
