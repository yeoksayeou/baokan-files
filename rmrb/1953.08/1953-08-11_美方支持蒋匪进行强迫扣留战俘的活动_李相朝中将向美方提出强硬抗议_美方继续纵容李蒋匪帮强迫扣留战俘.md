Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th: The Korean Military Armistice Commission reconvened on August 10th. Our Chief Delegate, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, delivered a statement at the meeting, strongly protesting the United Nations Command's support, assistance, and utilization of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the prisoner-of-war camps for captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers to continue various serious sabotage activities aimed at coercively detaining prisoners of war, which interfered with the implementation of the armistice agreement. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao stated: The United Nations Command must immediately cease its destructive actions of supporting and assisting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's interference with the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future; the United Nations Command must, in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," remove all Li and Chiang secret service personnel from its prisoner-of-war camps and prepare to replace them completely with personnel provided by India. The statement said that at any time, the United Nations Command must bear full responsibility for the situation of forced detention of prisoners of war and sabotage of the armistice agreement that occurs in the other side's prisoner-of-war camps. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    According to verified information, the United Nations Command Headquarters is actively supporting and assisting Chiang Kai-shek, the reactionary remnant bandit leader of the Chinese Kuomintang, in distributing photos of the bandit himself and issuing so-called "announcements" to our captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who are not directly repatriated, coercing them not to demand repatriation and claiming that the Chiang bandit himself will force our captured personnel to go to Taiwan. Now, a recording of this so-called "announcement" has been broadcast by the United Nations Command Headquarters to the prisoners of war detained on Jeju Island who are not directly repatriated.

    The "announcement" and photos have also been photocopied by the United Nations Command Headquarters and transported by your side to prisoner-of-war camps in Korea for distribution among these prisoners of war. The Korean-Chinese side believes that your side's adoption of this measure at a time when the Korean armistice has been realized and the clauses of the armistice agreement relating to prisoners of war are beginning to be implemented is not only a violation of the relevant clauses of the annex to the armistice agreement, the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," and a blatant insult to the dignity and self-esteem of our captured personnel, but is also clearly a serious act of sabotage intentionally using criminals and traitors of the Chinese people outside the Korean War to interfere with the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Korean-Chinese side resoloutely cannot tolerate this. I am instructed to lodge a strong protest with you against this action by your side.

    For a long time, in order to achieve the goal of coercively detaining prisoners of war, your side has dispatched a large number of Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, disguised as our captured personnel, to serve in various positions in the prisoner-of-war camps, as well as translators, teachers, and so on. Your side has used these secret agents to force prisoners of war to tattoo, write blood letters, and make fingerprints, indicating so-called "unwillingness to be repatriated," by means of inhumane atrocities such as beating, abuse, killing, disembowelment, and heart extraction. Even recently, after the Li Seung-man group used secret agents to forcibly detain more than 27,000 of our captured personnel and sabotage the prisoner-of-war agreement, your side is still continuing to use secret agents of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to coerce prisoners of war in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp. According to a report in the Hong Kong "New Evening News" on July 27th, Chen Jianzhong, the chief of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's secret agents, has been sent to South Korea to collude with Wang Dongyuan, the Kuomintang's agent in South Korea, and together plan, through Zhang Xirun, a confidant of Li Seung-man in South Korea, a plan to forcibly detain a large number of captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Du Guangtai and others, secret agents sent by Chen Jianzhong and Wang Dongyuan, are active in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp under the guise of U.S. military translators. They have fabricated incidents of prisoners of war writing blood letters and demanding "on-the-spot release" and "going to Taiwan," and are colluding with Li Seung-man's secret agents in Jeju Island to prepare to continue forcing prisoners of war to leave the prisoner-of-war camp through tunnels and wall holes dug by the secret agents. All of this fully proves that your side has not only intentionally coerced the detention of prisoners of war from beginning to end, but is also continuing to condone and encourage the Li Seung-man group and all saboteurs, including Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, in their evil attempts to sabotage the armistice agreement.

    Now, I, on behalf of the Korean-Chinese side, solemnly declare: The United Nations Command must immediately cease its destructive actions of supporting and assisting Chiang Kai-shek's criminals in interfering with the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and insulting our captured personnel, and strictly prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. In accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission": "Any other personnel needed to assist the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in performing its duties and responsibilities shall be provided exclusively by India," the United Nations Command must thoroughly remove all Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents who are serving in any position in its prisoner-of-war camps and prepare to replace them completely with personnel provided by India. At any time, the United Nations Command must bear full responsibility for the situation of forced detention of prisoners of war and sabotage of the armistice agreement resulting from the United Nations Command's use of various secret agents.
                                          August 10, 1953

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th: This agency's special correspondent Jiang Nan reports that, with the continued condoning of the U.S. side, the Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs are stepping up their activities in an attempt to continue to realize their conspiracy to coercively detain prisoners of war.

    On July 28th, Li Seung-man dispatched Won Yung-duk, the commander of the South Korean military police, in person to the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp to read a letter to the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who were not directly repatriated. This letter, signed by Li Seung-man, prohibited these prisoners of war from demanding repatriation after being transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. In this letter, Li Seung-man told them to "persevere" during the period of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custody of the prisoners of war, regardless of "what difficulties they may face," and told them "not to fear anything, just feel at ease." On the same day, Li Seung-man also wrote a letter with the exact same content and distributed it to the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who were not directly repatriated.

    Then, on July 30th, the Chiang bandit Kai-shek also issued an announcement, threatening the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers who were not directly repatriated not to demand repatriation. This announcement was also recorded and sent to the prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island, where it was publicly broadcast by the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp authorities. The Chiang bandit Kai-shek also said that he would have the United States send these prisoners of war to Taiwan. At the same time, Wang Dongyuan, the chief of the Chiang bandit's secret service stationed in South Korea, also stepped up his activities. He held a meeting with Taylor, the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, for an hour and a half on the 3rd.

    The U.S. side not only did not take measures to stop such unbridled activities by the Li-Chiang bandit gangs, but continued to condone and encourage them. According to United Press, Karl Rankin, the U.S. "ambassador" to the Chiang bandit gang, even assured the Chiang bandit gang on the 4th that the U.S. government would strictly abide by the so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle. In other words, the U.S. side will continue to allow Chiang bandit secret agents to use brutal means to create the hoax of coercively detaining prisoners of war.

    People here point out that, from all indications, the Li-Chiang bandit gangs are continuing to intensify the persecution of prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated in the prisoner-of-war camps after the armistice, threatening them not to demand repatriation, and instructing their secret agents lurking among the prisoners of war to obstruct and sabotage the explanatory work of the Korean-Chinese side after the prisoners of war are transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, so that the prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated cannot exercise their right to be repatriated, thereby realizing their evil purpose of coercively detaining prisoners of war. If the U.S. side continues to adopt a condoning attitude towards such conspiratorial activities by the Li-Chiang bandit gangs, then they must bear serious responsibility for any consequences arising therefrom.

    美方支持蒋匪进行强迫扣留战俘的活动
    李相朝中将向美方提出强硬抗议
    美方继续纵容李蒋匪帮强迫扣留战俘
    【新华社开城十日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会于八月十日复会。我方首席委员李相朝中将在会上发表声明，强硬抗议联合国军支持、协助并利用蒋介石匪帮在中国人民志愿军被俘人员的战俘营中，继续进行各种干涉停战协定的实施，旨在强迫扣留战俘的严重破坏行动。李相朝中将声明：联合国军必须立即停止支持和协助蒋介石匪帮干涉朝鲜停战协定之实施的破坏行动，并制止今后类似事件的发生；联合国军必须按照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，清除在其战俘营中的一切李、蒋特务工作人员，准备完全代之以印度所提供的工作人员。声明说，在任何时候，对方战俘营中所发生的强迫扣留战俘及破坏停战协定的情势，必须由联合国军负起全部的责任。该声明全文如下：
    根据已经证实的消息，联合国军司令部正在积极支持和协助中国国民党反动残余匪首蒋介石，对我方中国人民志愿军不直接遣返的被俘人员分发该匪本人照片并发表所谓“文告”，胁迫他们不许要求遣返，声称蒋匪本人将迫使我方被俘人员前往台湾。现在此项所谓“文告”录音片已由联合国军司令部向被拘留在济州岛的不直接遣返的战俘广播。
    “文告”及照片亦已由联合国军司令部影印，并已由你方运往朝鲜战俘营，在该批战俘中加以散发。朝中方面认为：在朝鲜停战已经实现，停战协定中有关战俘的条款正在开始实施之际，你方竟然采取这一措施，这不仅是违反停战协定附件“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的有关条款，公然侮辱我方被俘人员的尊严和自尊，而且显然是有意利用在朝鲜战争之外的、中国人民的罪犯和叛徒分子来干涉朝鲜停战协定之实施的严重破坏行动。朝中方面对此坚决不能容忍。我奉命向你对你方这一行动提出强硬抗议。
    长期以来，你方为了达到强迫扣留战俘的目的，派遣了大批李承晚、蒋介石特务，混充我方被俘人员，担任战俘营各种职务以及翻译、教员等等。你方利用这些特务以毒打、虐杀、剖腹、挖心等惨无人道的暴行，来强迫战俘刺字、写血书、打指印，表示所谓“不愿遣返”。甚至最近，在李承晚集团利用特务强迫扣留了二万七千余名我方被俘人员、破坏了战俘协议之后，你方还在继续使用蒋介石匪帮的特务在济州岛战俘营中对战俘施行胁迫。根据香港“新晚报”七月二十七日报道，蒋介石匪帮的特务首脑陈建中已被派去南朝鲜与国民党驻南朝鲜代理人王东原一起策动，并通过南朝鲜李承晚的亲信张锡润，共同布置强迫扣留大批中国人民志愿军被俘人员的计划。陈建中、王东原所派特务杜广泰等，即以美军翻译员名义，在济州岛战俘营活动。他们伪造了战俘写血书、要求“就地释放”、“到台湾去”的事件，并与李承晚在济州岛的特务勾结，准备继续强迫战俘从特务们所挖的地道和墙洞中离开战俘营。这一切完全证明你方不仅自始至终蓄意强迫扣留战俘，而且还正在继续纵容和鼓励李承晚集团并包括蒋介石特务在内的一切破坏分子，来破坏停战协定的罪恶企图。
    现在，我代表朝中方面严正声明：联合国军必须立即停止其支持和协助蒋介石罪犯干涉朝鲜停战协定之实施，并侮辱我方被俘人员的破坏行动，并严格制止今后类似事件的发生。根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第一条第二款：“为协助中立国遣返委员会执行其职务和责任所需的……任何其他工作人员应专由印度提供”的规定，联合国军必须彻底清除在其战俘营充当任何职务的一切李承晚和蒋介石特务分子，而准备完全代之以印度提供的工作人员。在任何时候，由于联合国军使用各种特务而产生的强迫扣留战俘、破坏停战协定的情势，必须由联合国军负起全部的责任。
                                          一九五三年八月十日
    【新华社开城十日电】本社特派记者江南报道，在美方继续纵容下，李承晚和蒋介石匪帮正在加紧活动，企图继续实现其强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。
    李承晚在七月二十八日派遣南朝鲜宪兵司令元容德亲自到美方战俘营中去向不直接遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员宣读了一封信。这封由李承晚署名的信，不许这些战俘在移交给中立国遣返委员会后要求遣返。李承晚在这封信中，要他们在中立国遣返委员会看管战俘期间，不管“可能会面临到何种困难”，“一定要坚持下去”，并要他们“不要惧怕任何事物，只管放心”。李承晚在同一天还写了一封内容完全相同的信，向不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员散发。
    接着，蒋匪介石在七月三十日也发表了一个文告，恫吓不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员不得要求遣返。这个文告并且在录音以后送到济州岛的战俘营去，由美方战俘营当局加以公开播送。蒋匪介石还说，他将使美国把这些战俘送到台湾去。与此同时，蒋匪驻南朝鲜大使特务头子王东原也加紧活动，他在三日与在朝鲜的美军第八军军长泰勒会谈了一个半小时。
    美方对李蒋匪帮的这种肆无忌惮的活动，不仅不采取措施予以制止，反而仍然加以纵容和鼓励。据合众社报道，美国驻蒋匪帮“大使”卡尔·兰金在四日竟然向蒋匪帮保证说，美国政府将严格遵守所谓“自愿遣返”的原则。换句话说，就是美方将继续听任蒋匪特务用残暴手段制造强迫扣留战俘的骗局。
    此间人士指出，从一切迹象看来，李蒋匪帮在停战以后仍继续在战俘营中加紧迫害不直接遣返的战俘，恫吓他们不得要求遣返，并指使其潜伏在战俘中间的特务分子，在战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会以后，对朝中方面的解释工作进行阻挠和破坏，使不直接遣返的战俘无法行使其被遣返的权利，从而实现他们强迫扣留战俘罪恶目的。对于李蒋匪帮的这种阴谋活动，美方如果继续采取纵容态度，那么他们就必须对由此引起的任何后果负严重的责任。
