Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: Tokyo dispatch: The people of Uchinada Village in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, are persisting in a long-term, heroic struggle against the establishment of a U.S. military firing range. Their struggle has won unanimous support from people of all walks of life throughout the country.

　　Uchinada Village is the 733rd base established by the American occupation forces in Japan. It is a fishing village in Ishikawa Prefecture facing the Sea of Japan. Since being forcibly occupied by the U.S. military as a firing range last September, the fierce opposition of the local people forced the Yoshida government to make a promise that it would only be "temporarily used by the U.S. military and would be returned in April 1953." However, when the "temporary use" period expired, the Yoshida government not only failed to fulfill its promise but instead decided to designate Uchinada Village as a permanent firing range for the U.S. military. This deceptive tactic by the Yoshida government aroused great anger among the people of Uchinada Village, who launched a brave and unyielding struggle to defend their livelihoods, which were being destroyed by the U.S. military firing range.

　　The struggle of the people of Uchinada Village has won widespread sympathy and support from people across the country. The Japanese working class has consistently supported the fishermen and peasant brothers of Uchinada Village with their practical actions. On June 11, when the U.S. military arbitrarily decided to begin target practice, the Hokuriku Private Railway Workers' Union immediately reiterated its past resolution, refusing to transport military supplies destined for the Uchinada firing range for the U.S. military. Subsequently, electrical workers, the National Railway Workers' Union, and the Japan Teachers' Union in Ishikawa Prefecture expressed their support one after another. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the largest trade union organization in Japan, also held a general uprising in June, focusing on the struggle of Uchinada Village against the establishment of a U.S. military firing range, to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet. On June 12, more than 300 members of the Hokuriku Private Railway Workers' Union, carrying protest banners, went to Uchinada Village to participate in the local demonstration. On June 13, more than 300 members of the National Railway Workers' Union and the Japan Electrical Industry Workers' Union held a rally at Kanazawa Railway Station before marching in a demonstration to Uchinada Village. The Japan Teachers' Union also donated money to support and sent representatives to the site to encourage the struggle of the people of Uchinada Village. At the same time, the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations also passed a resolution at its national conference to support the struggle of the villagers of Uchinada and sent representatives to the site to participate in the struggle. Doctors from the Kanazawa City Clinic voluntarily set up four aid stations in Uchinada to support the villagers' struggle. Professors from Kanazawa University, together with students, also submitted a protest to the Diet against the occupation of the Uchinada firing range. Calls for support for the people of Uchinada Village and protests against the Yoshida government's traitorous and pro-American measures are constantly being issued by people of all walks of life throughout Japan. In the ranks of the people of Uchinada Village petitioning in front of the Diet and staging sit-down demonstrations at the firing range, there are not only workers, students, teachers, office workers, and other righteous people but also monks in robes. The monks of Myohoji Temple in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, held a hunger strike to support the people of Uchinada Village. Kyodo News Agency could not but acknowledge that "the breadth of the strata involved in this movement (referring to the struggle of the people of Uchinada Village against the establishment of a U.S. military firing range) is unprecedented in similar movements in the past."

　　The Yoshida government has exhausted all kinds of despicable means to undermine the struggle of the people of Uchinada Village. After failing to intimidate them, it sent cabinet ministers such as Tanaka Fuwa three and others to Ishikawa Prefecture to carry out "persuasion."

　　After the "persuasion" failed, it used "compensation fees" to lure them, and finally revealed its hideous face, sending thousands of armed police to forcibly "take over."

　　However, with the enthusiastic support of the people across the country, the people of Uchinada Village disregarded all the sabotage schemes of the Yoshida government and persisted in their brave and tenacious struggle. Around the firing range and the U.S. military barracks, thousands of people are demonstrating every day, holding high banners that read "Swear to Defend Uchinada." In order to persist in the struggle after the U.S. military began target practice, the fishermen built more than 160 bomb shelters near the firing range and erected obstacles around the shelters. On June 14, the day before the U.S. military began live-fire target practice, when the first truck carrying U.S. bombs was about to enter Uchinada Village, an old woman lay in front of the truck and shouted: "I was born on this land, and I will die on this land. If you want to transport bombs for target practice, you will have to drive over my body!" That night, more than 800 villagers gathered at the firing range, including old people and women in their eighties. In front of more than 1,000 armed police officers of the Yoshida government, they shouted: "Even if artillery shells are fired, we will not retreat." On the morning of June 15, the U.S. military's artillery arbitrarily began firing. However, the heroic people still stood arm in arm, persisting in their struggle. Every time a shell exploded, they shouted the slogan: "Yankees, go home!" For many days after the U.S. military began target practice, three or four hundred people from Uchinada Village continued to guard the drop zone day and night, sleeping on the roads leading to the firing range, continuing their struggle. Later, in order to protect their livelihoods, they further broke through the barbed wire around the firing range and sailed fishing boats into the so-called "restricted areas" designated by the U.S. military to fish.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: Tokyo dispatch: The Yoshida government is preparing to follow the orders of the United States and openly suppress the Japanese people's increasingly high struggle against U.S. military bases. Saito Noboru, Director-General of the National Rural Police Headquarters of the Yoshida government, after inspecting Uchinada Village on the 18th, where the struggle against the establishment of a U.S. military firing range is taking place, openly stated in an interview with reporters that the Yoshida government will henceforth strictly crack down on the struggle against U.S. military bases throughout the country in accordance with the "Special Criminal Law."

　　The so-called "Special Criminal Law" is a repressive law enacted by the Yoshida government in order to maintain the privileges of the American occupation forces in Japan, based on the notorious U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement."

    日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争日益高涨
    内滩村人民坚持斗争反对美军设立打靶场
    【新华社二十六日讯】东京消息：日本石川县内滩村人民正坚持着长期的英勇斗争，反对美军设立打靶场，他们的斗争获得了全国各阶层人民的一致支援。
    内滩村是美国占领军在日本设立的第七百三十三个基地。它是石川县境内一个面临日本海的渔村。自从去年九月被美军霸占为打靶场后，由于当地人民的激烈反对，曾迫使吉田政府作出“仅交给美军临时使用，到一九五三年四月就收回”的诺言。可是到“临时使用”期满时，吉田政府不仅没有履行诺言，反而决定把内滩村划作美军永久使用的打靶场。吉田政府这种欺诈手段激起了内滩村人民的巨大愤怒，他们为了保卫自己被美军打靶所破坏的生计，展开了英勇不屈的斗争。
    内滩村人民的斗争获得了全国人民的普遍同情和支持。日本工人阶级始终以自己的实际行动支援了内滩村的渔民和农民弟兄。六月十一日，当美军蛮横地决定了要开始打靶演习时，附近的北陆私营铁道工会立即重申过去的决议，拒绝给美军运输送往内滩打靶场的军事物资。接着就有石川县的电气工人，国营铁道工会和日本教职员工会等纷纷表示支援。日本最大的工会组织日本工会总评议会并曾以内滩村反对美军设立打靶场的斗争为中心问题，在六月间举行了一次打倒吉田内阁的总奋起大会。六月十二日，北陆私营铁道工会会员三百多人，打着抗议的旗子到内滩村参加了当地的示威。六月十三日，国营铁道工会和日本电气产业工会的会员三百多人，在金泽火车站举行集会后列队赶到内滩村举行示威游行。日本教职员工会也捐款支援并派了代表到现地去鼓舞内滩村人民的斗争。同时，全日本学生自治会总联合会也在全国大会上通过支持内滩村民斗争的决议，并派代表到现地去参加斗争。金泽市诊疗所的医生们为了支援村民的斗争，自动到内滩来设立了四个救护站。金泽大学的教授们也和学生一道向国会提出反对占用内滩打靶场的抗议。支援内滩村人民的斗争，抗议吉田政府卖国媚美措施的呼声，不断地从日本全国各阶层人民中发出来。在内滩村人民在国会前请愿和在打靶场静坐示威的行列里，不仅有工人、学生、教师、职员和其他的正义人士，而且还有披着袈裟的和尚。东京日本桥妙法寺的和尚曾为支援内滩村人民而举行绝食。共同社也不能不承认：“这个运动（指内滩村人民反对美军设立打靶场的斗争）的阶层的广泛是过去这类运动所不能比拟的。”
    吉田政府为了破坏内滩村人民的斗争，曾经用尽了各种卑鄙的手段。在威吓不成之后，曾派出内阁大员田中不破三等人亲到石川县来进行“说服”。
    “说服”失败之后又用“赔偿费”来进行引诱，而终于露出狰狞的面目，派出成千的武装警察来强制
    “接收”。
    但是，在全国人民的热烈支援下，内滩村人民不顾吉田政府的一切破坏阴谋，坚持了英勇顽强的斗争。在打靶场和美国兵营的周围，每天都有成千的人高举着“誓死保卫内滩”的标语进行示威。为了在美军实行打靶后坚持斗争，渔民们在打靶场附近筑起了一百六十多个避弹所，并在避弹所的四周架设了障碍物。美军开始实弹打靶的前一日——六月十四日，当第一辆卡车载着美国炮弹将要驶进内滩村时，一位老妇人横卧在卡车前喊道：“我生在这块土地上，我死也要死在这块土地上，你们要想运炮弹来打靶，就从我身上开过去吧！”这天晚上，有八百多村民集聚在打靶场，其中有八十多岁的老人和妇女。他们在一千多名吉田政府的武装警察面前高喊着：“即使大炮轰击，我们也不后退”。六月十五日的早晨，美军的大炮蛮横地开始射击了。可是英雄的人民仍然臂挽着臂，坚持着斗争。每当一颗炮弹爆发时，他们就高喊一声：“美国佬滚回去！”的口号。在美军开始打靶以后的许多日子里，内滩村人民仍然有三、四百人日以继夜地守在落弹地区，睡在通往打靶场的道路上，继续进行斗争。后来，他们为了保卫自己的生计，并进一步突破了打靶场四周的铁丝网，把渔船驶入美军划定的所谓“禁区”内去捕鱼。
    【新华社二十六日讯】东京消息：吉田政府正准备遵照美国的命令，公开镇压日本人民一天天高涨的反对美国军事基地的斗争。吉田政府的国家地方警察本部长官斋藤升在十八日视察了正在进行着反对美军设立打靶场的斗争的内滩村以后，在向新闻记者发表谈话时公然表示：吉田政府今后将按照
    “刑事特别法”来严格取缔全国各地反对美国军事基地的斗争。
    所谓“刑事特别法”是吉田政府为了维护美国占领军在日本的特权，根据臭名远扬的美日“行政协定”而制订的镇压法律。
