    Director: Hungarian Film Production Company Directing Department Translator: Liu Chuanyan
    Produced in 1951 by the Hungarian Film Production Company Translated by Northeast Film Studio, Central Film Bureau
    This is a film based on the conspiracy activities carried out by American imperialism in Hungary, which were revealed by the Hungarian Public Security Organs in 1948.
    We know that in 1947, Hungary began to implement its Three-Year National Economic Plan, and the Hungarian people rapidly restored and developed their national economy. This significant achievement is inseparable from the Hungarian people's victory in crushing the conspiracies and sabotage activities of enemies at home and abroad. The film "Underground Colony" depicts the major event of the Hungarian working class thwarting American imperialism's attempt to sabotage oil production. American imperialist spies, following American instructions, engaged in slowdowns at the Hungarian-American Oil Company, doing their best to limit oil production in an attempt to paralyze Hungary's oil production, thereby achieving their goal of weakening the People's Republic of Hungary. This was a huge political conspiracy. "White Book of the People's Republic of Hungary (Documents on the Hostile Activities of the U.S. Government Against the People's Republic of Hungary)" revealed the materials regarding this case: "After liberation, American companies consistently sabotaged oil production, causing economic losses to Hungary." "They spent 13 million forints on drilling in places where they knew very well that oil could not be extracted. At the same time, they prohibited exploration in areas where experts believed good results could be obtained."
    On the other hand, the Hungarian working class wanted to open up the country's natural treasure – oil – to power thousands upon thousands of machines and serve the construction of their motherland.
    The entire plot of the film revolves around this conflict. It begins with the Hungarian Ministry of National Defense investigating the car accident that injured Chief Engineer Bano, gradually revealing this complex and fierce struggle, and attracting the audience to pay attention to the development of the event. The film profoundly depicts the great significance of this struggle, exposes the truth about American imperialists carrying out conspiracies and sabotage activities within the people's democratic countries; at the same time, it also praises the Hungarian workers, public security personnel, and scientists who, under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party, made brave and resolute struggles to defend the interests of their motherland.
    One of the main characters in the film, the American special agent Delton, came to Hungary with instructions to reduce Hungarian oil production and lead conspiracy activities. The film portrays this character very well, and through the description of this character, as well as the activities of the large and small spies around him, it profoundly reveals that the essence of American imperialism's conspiracy is to wage war. The film depicts a scene in which Delton and Brookman, a director of the American Markelt Oil Company, and Babo, a manager, talk about letting the oil remain buried underground and not allowing it to be extracted, vividly and profoundly showing the real reason why the enemy would not let the Hungarian people obtain a single drop of oil. Delton said: "In the past, when there was a war, smart people had to bury their treasures." When Brookman regretted that they could not bury the colonies as well, Delton proudly shouted: "We have a kind of colony that does not need to be buried, and that is oil." They regarded oil as their most reliable underground colony. He said: "In case of any misfortune with the colonies and the colonial system, then protecting the underground oil is our bounden duty. Later, when the situation changes, the oil will all be ours. So, today, let the oil here lie underground." Following this description, the film further reveals that the truth about the conspiracy led by Delton is to wage war. At the U.S. Embassy in Hungary, Delton told American capitalists in Hungary to strictly and unconditionally abide by the U.S. policy in Hungary. The American capitalists complained:
    "Our company's profits are decreasing day by day." But he resolutely said: "You don't have to worry about this. The Bible tells us that lean years are followed by prosperous years. Never forget this sentence." What does the "prosperous year" referred to here mean? It is war. They wanted to reap the greatest profits from the war. When the American capitalists heard Delton talk about a new war again, they were very surprised: "The last World War ended less than three years ago!" Delton shouted: "That's for you. For us, the new war has been going on for thirty years." This vividly portrays Delton, who represents the interests of American monopoly capital, and also appropriately expresses in the plot that the American policy is for war.
    The film's depiction of Delton discovering that Bano, the chief engineer of Markelt Oil Company, was planning an oil drilling project and wanting to send Bano to the United States to mine is a brilliant use of vivid language to clearly tell the audience the positions and thoughts of both sides. On the one hand, it realistically portrays the face of Delton, an American political rogue, and on the other hand, it vividly depicts Chief Engineer Bano, who loves his motherland and is proud of his motherland's excellent historical traditions. Delton wanted Bano to go to the United States, but Bano firmly refused. Delton said: "You can only open two oil wells here, but in the United States you can open thousands of oil wells." Bano believed: "One liter of Hungarian oil is worth more than one hundred liters of American oil." Because every drop of Hungarian oil is used to serve the cause of peaceful construction. And the United States has a lot of oil, which is used for war. Delton not only had imperialist racial prejudices and looked down on Bano himself, but also despised Hungary's past and present. He did not hide this reactionary thought and slandered the Hungarian people in front of Bano. He said: "You are a geologist. Geologists here have no past and no future. The hometown of geology is in the United States!" This slander angered Bano, who countered Delton with facts, saying that Hungary not only has a great future, but also has a glorious past. When Bano said that the most important machine for oil extraction, the torsion balance, was invented by the Hungarian scientist Lóránd Eötvös, Delton immediately revealed his predatory nature: "That's good, take him to the United States too!" Unfortunately, this Hungarian scientist, who had been dead for thirty years, could not be taken away by this American who only understood business and lacked general knowledge. Seeing that "persuasion" was unsuccessful, Delton then basely threatened that if Bano did not abandon his oil drilling plan or go to the United States, he would find a way to cure Bano's famous "patriotic disease." Delton came up with a solution, but Bano's "patriotic disease" was not "cured." Under the wheels of the American special agent's car, he more clearly recognized the abominable nature of the enemy and the loveliness of his motherland. Bano came out of pure theoretical research that did not connect with practical work and became a conscious, unyielding fighter for the cause of peaceful construction. The film allows us to clearly see the process of Bano's ideological growth. His noble qualities are so worthy of our respect and learning. The film expresses his character by placing him in the development of fierce struggles, thus having a strong appeal and persuasiveness. The film not only depicts a fierce struggle between him and Delton, but also specifically depicts the ideological education work carried out by Liergesh, the advanced representative of the working class, on Bano, making us feel that this character is real.
    Through the portrayal of Bano, the film not only warmly praises the major contributions made by Hungarian patriotic scientists on the economic front, pointing out that a scientist must have a high degree of patriotic thought; at the same time, it also forcefully criticizes the erroneous idea of not connecting theoretical work with practical work. This has great educational significance for our audiences, especially scientific workers.
    The film also successfully praises the Hungarian working class for their tenacious struggle to build their motherland, as well as the outstanding achievements of the public security personnel in protecting the interests of the Hungarian people. We see on the screen Liergesh, the advanced representative of the working class, who is so strong, with the attitude of being the master of the country, struggling with the enemy for the interests of the Hungarian working class and the Hungarian people, uniting and educating Chief Engineer Bano, and successfully completing the arduous task of increasing oil production assigned to him by the Party and the government, smashing the enemy's conspiracy to prevent the Hungarian people from getting a single drop of oil.
    In the film, the image of this positive character is very distinct. As soon as he accepted the task given to him by the Hungarian Ministry of Industry and took office as the director of the production department of Markelt Oil Company, he encountered the American capitalists firing workers. He immediately found the American capitalists without hesitation and made him revoke the decision to fire the workers. With his loyalty to the motherland and his sincere and trusting attitude towards the upright scientist Bano, he made Bano change his purely academic viewpoint of detachment from politics, combine theory with practice, and only then did he dig out the oil buried underground in Hungary. The film depicts Liergesh guiding Chief Engineer Bano onto the correct path, not by using empty preaching, but by depicting Liergesh using the specific facts happening around them to enlighten Bano. American imperialist spies deliberately destroyed thirty oil wells, saying that there was no oil underground. Liergesh said to Bano: "The motherland has thousands upon thousands of machines and vehicles that need oil, but we can't get it out. You have to know where the oil is. I will dig it out with my ten fingers. Please help us!" Bano was moved by this sincere personality, and he said: "Okay, I'll go find it. I will never allow this situation to continue." Liergesh adhered to the correct line of the Party of uniting scientific and technical personnel and organizing the labor enthusiasm of the workers, and he achieved great success. The film's profound depiction of this character leaves an unforgettable impression on people.
    With a high degree of political sensitivity, the authors of the film timely expressed the conspiracy and sabotage events of American imperialism, which were revealed in 1948, in the form of film art. This film is not only of great educational significance to the Hungarian people, but also has a profound educational effect on the Chinese audience and the people of the world. It was by no means accidental that it won a special honorary award at the Sixth International Film Festival. (Attached picture)

    看匈牙利影片“地下殖民地”
    叶遥
    编导：匈牙利电影制片公司编导部    翻译：刘传炎
    匈牙利电影制片公司一九五一年出品中央电影局东北电影制片厂译制
    这是一部根据一九四八年匈牙利公安机关所揭露的美帝国主义在匈牙利进行的阴谋活动为题材而创作的影片。
    我们知道，一九四七年匈牙利开始实施了三年国民经济计划，匈牙利人民迅速地恢复和发展了他们的国民经济。这一重大成就，是与匈牙利人民摧毁国内外敌人的阴谋破坏活动的胜利分不开的。影片“地下殖民地”所描写的，就是匈牙利工人阶级粉碎了美帝国主义企图破坏石油生产的重大事件。美帝国主义的间谍分子，遵照美国的训令，在匈牙利的匈美石油公司进行怠工活动，他们尽力限制石油产量，企图使匈牙利的石油生产陷于瘫痪，以达到他们削弱匈牙利人民共和国的目的。这是一个巨大的政治阴谋。“匈牙利人民共和国白皮书（关于美国政府反对匈牙利人民共和国的敌对活动的文件）”揭露了关于这一案件的材料：“解放之后，美国公司一贯地破坏石油生产，造成匈牙利经济上的损失。”“他们花费了一千三百万福林的费用在他们明明知道不可能开出石油的地方钻井。同时，他们禁止在专家认为可以获得良好结果的地方探测。”
    另一方面，匈牙利的工人阶级，要打开祖国的天然宝藏——石油，去开动千千万万的机器，为建设他们的祖国服务。
    影片的全部情节，就是围绕着这一冲突而展开的。它以匈牙利国防部追究巴诺总工程师被汽车撞伤事件为引线，逐步揭开了这一复杂、激烈的斗争，吸引观众去注视事件的发展。影片深刻地描写了这一斗争的重大意义，揭露了美帝国主义者在人民民主国家内部进行阴谋破坏活动的真相；同时，也歌颂了匈牙利工人、公安人员以及科学家，在匈牙利劳动人民党的领导下，为保卫他们祖国的利益，所作的勇敢坚决的斗争。
    影片中的主要人物之一美国特务德尔顿，是带着降低匈牙利石油生产的指示，来到匈牙利，领导阴谋活动的。影片很好地刻划了这个人物，通过对这个人物的描写，以及对环绕在他周围的大小间谍分子的活动的描写，把美帝国主义的阴谋实质是为了进行战争这一点，作了很深刻的揭露。影片描写德尔顿和美国马克尔特石油公司董事布鲁德曼、经理巴波谈到让石油埋藏在地下、不给开采出来的一场戏，把敌人不让匈牙利人民得到一滴石油的真实原因，很生动地、深刻地显示了出来。德尔顿说：“在从前，当有了战争，聪明的人要把他们的财宝埋藏起来。”布鲁德曼惋惜着他们不能把殖民地也埋藏起来时，德尔顿就得意地大喊起来：“我们有一种殖民地，它不需要我们埋藏，那就是石油。”他们把石油当作他们最可靠的地下殖民地。他说：“万一殖民地和殖民地制度有什么不幸，那么，保护地下的石油就是我们的天职。以后等到变天了，石油就都是我们的。所以，在今天，这儿的石油就让它躺在地下。”影片在这样的描写之后，紧接着把德尔顿所领导的阴谋真相是为了进行战争，作了更进一步的揭露。在驻匈牙利的美国公使馆里，德尔顿对在匈牙利的美国资本家说，要他们严格地、无条件地遵守美国在匈牙利的政策，美国的资本家们诉起苦来：
    “我们公司的利润，一天比一天减低了。”他却断然地说：“这你不必担忧，圣经告诉我们，荒年的后面跟着丰年，千万不要忘记这句话。”这里所指的
    “丰年”是什么呢？是战争。他们想从战争中捞取最大的利润。当美国资本家们听见德尔顿又谈到新的战争时感到十分惊讶：“上次世界大战结束了还不到三年哪！”德尔顿叫嚣着：“这是对你来说，对我们来说，新的战争已经进行三十年了。”这就把
    一个代表美国垄断资本利益的德尔顿，给生动地描绘出来了，也把美国的政策是为了战争这一点，在剧情中很恰当地表现出来了。
    影片关于德尔顿发现马克尔特石油公司的总工程师巴诺，正在计划钻油工程时，他要把巴诺送到美国去采矿的描写，是非常精彩地运用了生动的语言，把两者的立场、思想明确地告诉了观众。一方面它把德尔顿这个美国政治流氓的面貌，作了真实的刻划，另一方面，把一个热爱祖国，以自己祖国的优秀历史传统为骄傲的巴诺总工程师，也作了生动的描绘。德尔顿要巴诺去美国，巴诺坚决拒绝。德尔顿说：“你在这里只可以开两个油井，在美国你能开几千个油井。”巴诺认为：“一公升匈牙利石油，比一百公升美国石油要值得多。”因为每一滴匈牙利石油都是用来为和平建设事业服务的。而美国的石油多，它是用于战争的。德尔顿不但带着帝国主义的种族论者的偏见，对巴诺本人瞧不起，而且对匈牙利的过去和现在都是蔑视的。他毫不掩饰这种反动的思想，在巴诺面前污蔑匈牙利人民。他说：“你是个地质学家，在这儿地质学家没有过去，也没有将来，地质学的老家在美国！”这种污蔑激怒了巴诺，巴诺用事实反击了德尔顿，说匈牙利不但有它伟大的未来，而且也有它光荣的过去。当巴诺说开采石油最重要的机器钮秤就是匈牙利的科学家吕特约士发明的时，德尔顿马上露出了他的掠夺特性：“那好，也把他带到美国去！”很可惜，这位已经死去三十年的匈牙利科学家，并不能被这位只懂生意经，而缺乏一般常识的美国佬带了去。德尔顿看“劝告”不成，便进而卑鄙地扬言，如果巴诺不放弃他的钻油计划，或不去美国，他就要想法治巴诺有名的“爱国主义病”。德尔顿的办法是想出来了，但巴诺的“爱国主义病”并没有被“治”过来，他在美国特务的汽车轮下，更清醒地认识了敌人的可憎和他的祖国的可爱。巴诺从不联系实际工作的纯理论研究中走出来，成为一个自觉的、坚强不屈的、为和平建设事业而斗争的战士。影片使我们清楚地看到巴诺这个人物，在思想上成长的过程，他的高贵品质是那么值得我们尊重和学习。影片把这个人物放在激烈的斗争的发展中来表现他的性格，因而有强烈的感染力和说服力。影片不但描写了他和德尔顿的一场激烈斗争，而且也具体地描写了代表工人阶级的先进人物黎尔格士，对巴诺所进行的思想教育工作，使我们感到这个人物是真实的。
    影片通过巴诺这个人物的描写，不但热烈地赞扬了匈牙利爱国的科学家们在经济战线上所作的重大贡献，指出了一个科学家必须具有高度的爱国主义思想；同时，也有力地批判了不把理论工作和实际工作相联系的错误思想。这对我国的观众，尤其是科学工作者们，有很大的教育意义。
    影片也很成功地歌颂了匈牙利的工人阶级，为建设他们的祖国所作的顽强斗争，以及保卫匈牙利人民利益的公安人员的杰出劳绩。我们在银幕上看到代表工人阶级先进人物的黎尔格士，他是那么坚强地，以国家主人翁的态度，为匈牙利工人阶级和匈牙利人民的利益，去和敌人斗争，去团结教育巴诺总工程师，把党和政府交给他的增产石油的艰巨任务，胜利地完成了，粉碎了敌人不让匈牙利人民得到一滴石油的阴谋。
    在影片中，这个正面人物的形象是非常鲜明的。他刚一接受匈牙利工业部给他的任务，到马克尔特石油公司任生产部主任，就碰上美国资本家开除工人的事件。他毫不迟疑地马上找到美国资本家，使他撤销了开除工人的决定。他以他对祖国的忠诚，以对正直的科学家巴诺的诚恳和信任态度，使巴诺改变了脱离政治的纯学术观点，把理论和实际结合起来，将埋藏在匈牙利地下的石油才挖了出来。影片描写黎尔格士引导巴诺总工程师走上正确的途径，不是用空洞的说教去进行的，而是描写黎尔格士用发生在他们周围的具体事实，去启发巴诺的。美帝国主义间谍们故意蹧蹋了三十个油井，说地下没有石油了。黎尔格士向巴诺说：“祖国有千千万万个机器和车辆在需要石油，可是我们拿不出来，要知道石油在哪儿，用十个指头我也要把它挖出来。请你帮助我们吧！”巴诺被这种真诚的人格所感动，他说：“好吧，我去找，我决不允许这种情况再继续下去。”黎尔格士坚持了党的团结科学技术人员和组织工人群众的劳动热情的正确路线，他便得到了很大成功。影片对这个人物的深刻描写，使这个人物给人留下了难忘的印象。
    影片的作者们以高度的政治敏感，及时地把一九四八年所揭露的美帝国主义的阴谋破坏事件，用电影艺术形式表现出来。这部影片不仅对匈牙利人民有很大的教育意义，对中国观众和世界人民也有很深刻的教育作用。它在第六届国际电影节上，获得了特别荣誉奖，决不是偶然的。（附图片）
