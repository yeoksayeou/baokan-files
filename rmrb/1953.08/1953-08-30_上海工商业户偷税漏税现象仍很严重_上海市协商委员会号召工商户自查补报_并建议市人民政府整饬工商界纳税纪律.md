Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 30th:

    The phenomenon of tax evasion by industrial and commercial businesses in Shanghai is still quite serious. The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee held its third enlarged meeting on August 15th to discuss this issue. The meeting decided to recommend that the Shanghai Municipal People's Government rectify tax discipline in the industrial and commercial sector, and called on all industrial and commercial businesses in the city to promptly conduct self-inspection and supplementary reporting, and earnestly abide by national tax laws.

    Incidents of tax evasion by industrial and commercial businesses in Shanghai have continued to occur recently, with particularly serious cases of inaccurate income tax declarations and tax evasion in 1952. A recent random check by the Municipal Taxation Bureau of the account books of 2,758 self-reporting taxpayers revealed that 2,347 of them had engaged in tax evasion. The methods of tax evasion included inflating the initial inventory price, suppressing the final inventory price, overestimating depreciation in the production department, underreporting capital expenditures, falsely listing the quantity of goods purchased, concealing the quantity of goods sold, suppressing the sales price, and not recording purchases and sales in the accounts at all, totaling seventy-seven different methods.

    Among these 2,347 industrial and commercial businesses engaged in tax evasion, while some businesses evaded taxes due to unsound account books, poor management systems, and a lack of attention to the study of tax laws, many businesses with relatively good conditions deliberately failed to improve their account books and management systems. Some even deliberately confused account books and disrupted management systems to conceal tax evasion. Some were even knowingly violating the law and evading taxes in a planned manner. In some tax evasion cases uncovered by the Taxation Bureau, a few were extremely egregious. For example, some privately forged other people's seals and fabricated receipts to falsely list huge commissions in order to evade taxes; others established two sets of invoices. After being discovered, some refused to admit their mistakes and instead stubbornly clamored, threatening tax officials with "closing the store," and tearing up payment slips, refusing to fulfill their tax obligations.

    The enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee discussed this serious situation of tax evasion. After listening to the report by Zhu Ruyan, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau, on the inspection of the 1952 income tax final settlement situation in Shanghai, more than ten committee members, including Liu Hongsheng, Hu Juewen, Shen Zhiyuan, Rong Yiren, Jing Shuping, Wang Xingyao, and Shen Han, spoke successively. They unanimously expressed indignation at the illegal behavior of some industrial and commercial businesses who, after the "Five-Anti" campaign, still did not pay attention to national taxation, and even deliberately evaded taxes, undermining national tax revenue. They expressed their approval of the proposal made by Zhu Ruyan that the industrial and commercial sector should launch a self-inspection and supplementary reporting campaign. They also demanded that the government severely punish those unscrupulous elements who intentionally evaded taxes with egregious circumstances, in accordance with the law.

    Pan Hannian, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee, pointed out at the meeting that over the past year, the operating style and tax attitude of industrial and commercial businesses in Shanghai have improved to some extent. However, it has recently been discovered that the old capitalist bad habits of seeking profits and engaging in speculation are resurfacing among some industrial and commercial businesses. The behavior of making false declarations of income tax for 1952 and serious tax evasion cannot be tolerated. Industrial and commercial businesses should recognize that such practices will affect the progress of economic construction, endanger the interests of the state and the people, seriously undermine national fiscal revenue, and hinder the development of legitimate industrial and commercial businesses. In order to reverse these bad habits and rectify tax discipline in the industrial and commercial sector, it is necessary to carry out a self-inspection and supplementary reporting campaign throughout the city recently. The government's policy is to welcome all industrial and commercial businesses who can earnestly conduct self-inspection and conscientiously carry out supplementary reporting and will treat them leniently. However, those who intentionally evade taxes and refuse to conduct self-inspection and supplementary reporting, and whose circumstances are serious and attitudes are particularly bad, will be severely punished according to law. Pan Hannian also called on the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, trade unions, and other relevant units to closely cooperate and fully implement widespread publicity and mobilization, clearly explain policies, and ensure that every industrial and commercial business receives a profound education in tax discipline through this self-inspection and supplementary reporting campaign.

    After consultation and discussion, the meeting decided to submit the following four suggestions to the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and relevant units:

    1. It is recommended that the Municipal People's Government conduct a thorough inspection to rectify discipline in the industrial and commercial sector. Within a certain period, industrial and commercial businesses should be allowed to conduct self-inspection, focusing on the income tax payable for 1952, combined with the business tax, commodity circulation tax, and goods tax for 1953, through self-inspection and supplementary reporting. However, those industrial and commercial businesses who refuse to earnestly conduct self-inspection and supplementary reporting within the deadline and intentionally evade taxes should be severely punished according to law. 2. It is recommended that the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce mobilize and urge industrial and commercial businesses to promptly conduct self-inspection and supplementary reporting (excluding fixed-amount taxpayers and peddlers), strengthen ideological education on tax policies in the industrial and commercial sector, attach importance to national taxation, earnestly abide by national tax laws, and resolutely oppose tax evasion and other egregious behaviors. 3. It is recommended that the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions call on the vast number of workers and staff in the city, under the leadership of trade unions at all levels, to persuade and assist capitalists in completing self-inspection and supplementary reporting on schedule and play a protective role in taxation. 4. It is recommended that the consultative committees of each district immediately convene meetings to promote self-inspection and supplementary reporting work in the industrial and commercial sector and rectify tax discipline.

    上海工商业户偷税漏税现象仍很严重
    上海市协商委员会号召工商户自查补报
    并建议市人民政府整饬工商界纳税纪律
    目前上海市工商业户偷税漏税现象仍相当严重，上海市各界人民代表会议协商委员会常务委员会在八月十五日召开第三次扩大会议，对此进行了讨论。会议决定建议上海市人民政府整饬工商界纳税纪律，并号召全市工商业户迅速自查补报，切实遵守国家税务法令。
    上海市工商业户偷税漏税的事件最近仍不断发生，一九五二年度所得税申报不实、偷税漏税的情况尤其严重。市税务局最近抽查了二千七百五十八家自报查帐户的帐册，即发现有二千三百四十七户偷税漏税。偷税漏税的方法，有抬高期初存货价格、抑低期末存货价格、多计生产部门折旧、少计资本支出、虚列进货数量、隐匿销货数量、抑低销货价格以及进销货都不入帐等七十七种之多。
    在这二千三百四十七家偷税漏税的工商业户中，固然有一部分工商户由于帐册不健全、管理制度不好、不重视税法的学习，因而造成漏税事件；但不少条件相当好的工商业户却是故意不去健全帐册、改善管理制度，有的甚至故意混淆帐册和打乱管理制度，以掩饰偷税行为。有的更是明知故犯、有计划地偷税漏税。在税务局查获的一些偷税漏税案件中，还有少数是情节极为恶劣的。如有的为了偷税，竟私自伪造他人印章，假造收据，虚列巨额佣金；有的建立两套发票；经查获后，有的竟不肯认错，反而蛮横叫嚣，以“关店”来威胁税务工作人员，并撕毁交款书，拒不履行纳税义务。
    上海市各界人民代表会议协商委员会常务委员会扩大会议，针对这一偷税、漏税的严重情况进行了讨论。到会各委员听取了上海市人民政府税务局副局长朱如言关于检查上海市一九五二年度所得税汇算清交情况的报告以后，有刘鸿生、胡厥文、沈志远、荣毅仁、经叔平、王性尧、沈涵等十余人相继发言。他们对部分工商业户在“五反”后仍不重视国家税收，甚至故意偷税漏税，破坏国家税收的违法行为，一致表示愤慨。对朱如言所提出的工商界应展开自查补报的建议，表示赞同。他们并要求政府对那些蓄意偷税漏税情节恶劣的不良分子，依法予以严惩。
    上海市协商委员会副主席潘汉年在会上指出：一年多来，上海市工商业户在经营作风上和纳税态度上已经有所改进；但是最近发现部分工商业户唯利是图、投机取巧的旧资本主义的坏作风又在重新抬头。对于一九五二年度所得税申报不实和严重偷税漏税的行为，是不能允许的。工商业户应该认识这样做法将影响经济建设的进行，危害国家人民的利益，严重地破坏国家财政的收入，并将阻碍正当工商业户经营的发展。为了扭转这些不良作风，整饬工商界的纳税纪律，最近在全市开展一次自查补报工作是有必要的。政府的政策，对于那些凡是能够认真自查、切实进行补报的工商业户，一律抱欢迎态度，可以从宽处理；但对于那些蓄意偷税漏税而不肯自查补报，情节严重、态度特别恶劣的，必将依法予以严惩。潘汉年并号召上海市工商业联合会、工会以及各有关单位密切配合，充分做到广泛宣传动员，明确交代政策，务使每一个工商业户通过这次自查补报工作，都能受到一次深刻的纳税纪律教育。
    经过协商讨论，会议决定向上海市人民政府及有关单位提出以下四个建议：
    一、建议市人民政府进行一次深入的检查工作，整饬工商界的纪律。在一定期限内，允许工商户以应缴之一九五二年所得税为重点，并结合一九五三年营业税、商品流通税、货物税，用自查补报的方式，进行自我检查。但在限期内不肯认真自查补报蓄意偷税的工商户，则应依法从严处理。二、建议市工商业联合会，动员督促工商户迅速进行自查补报（定期定额户及摊贩户除外），并加强工商界税收政策的思想教育，重视国家税收，切实遵守国家税务法令，坚决反对偷税漏税等恶劣行为。三、建议市总工会号召全市广大职工，在各级工会的领导下，劝导与协助资方如期完成自查补报工作，发挥护税作用。四、建议各区协商委员会，迅即召集会议，推动工商界自查补报工作，整饬纳税纪律。
