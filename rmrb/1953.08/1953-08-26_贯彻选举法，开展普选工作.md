    Tianjin Workers in Various Factories Create Outstanding Production Achievements to Greet the Universal Suffrage

    Tianjin workers in various factories, in the upsurge of welcoming universal suffrage, are creating outstanding production achievements with the attitude of masters of the country.

    Many factories, such as the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant, North China Bone Glue Factory, Tianjin Vehicle Factory, and the private Hengyuan Textile Factory, have launched production emulation campaigns to welcome universal suffrage. In the state-owned Tianjin Vehicle Factory, more than a dozen of the twenty-eight workers in Yang Xinru's group had witnessed the ugly farce of the Kuomintang electing pseudo-National Assembly representatives. This time, after studying the Election Law and related documents, they held three or four discussions. Based on their personal experiences, they deeply realized the value of people's democracy, and each proposed to dedicate the achievement of exceeding the production plan as a gift to welcome universal suffrage. Tian Min, a young female lathe operator, who recently was promoted from apprentice to third-grade lathe operator, actively learned technology from others and worked hard to study her profession, resulting in a doubling of output and a reduction of defective products by nearly half. The entire group completed the July production emulation plan seven days ahead of schedule. Workers in the carpentry workshop of the state-owned Tianjin Machine Tool Repair Factory, under the slogan of welcoming universal suffrage, created the "large window marking machine," "small window marking machine," and "nail pressing method," which increased work efficiency by an average of three times. The workshop originally planned to complete 65 percent of a certain project in July, but completed the entire task on July 17.

    Labor models from various factories who have made outstanding contributions to production actively participated in the universal suffrage movement. Zhang Shuyun and Meng Shuyuan, municipal-level special-class labor models, have become active promoters of universal suffrage. National labor model Wang Deshan, municipal special-class labor model Wang Fuyuan, and others served as members of the district-level election committees. Cheng Yunhan, the leader of the ironwork department of the state-owned Tianjin Machine Tool Repair Factory and a municipal-level labor model, promoted universal suffrage to the ironwork department workers after the election began, and helped worker Chi Xiyao improve his work methods, completing a task that was originally scheduled to take three months in just twenty-seven days.

    Women of the Hui Nationality Autonomous Region in Gui Sui Actively Participate in Political Power Work

    Hui women in the Hui Nationality Autonomous Region of Guisui actively participate in political power work and are deeply supported by people of all ethnic groups. According to statistics at the end of July this year, 193 have been elected as neighborhood and group leaders, and 19 have been elected as district representatives and directors of residents' committees, accounting for more than 63 percent of the total number of neighborhood and group cadres in the district.

    The main reason why Hui female cadres are supported by the masses is their serious and responsible work and concern for the lives of the masses. For example, Xinmin Street in the district used to be the dirtiest place in Guisui, but since Hui women Tong Yuzhen was elected as neighborhood leader and Ma Xiu was elected as the health committee member of the residents' committee, they have actively led residents to clean up street garbage and designated Friday as Patriotic Health Day for regular inspections. Now, collective cleaning of the environment every day has become a habit on the street, thus winning the title of Guisui's Model Health Street. Another example is Ma Yuqing, director of the street women's federation in Kuanxiangzi Street in the district, who, in addition to actively promoting various tasks, also organized five women's production teams. She goes to factories, organs, or construction sites to take on the washing of clothes and bedding, and actively unites team members to exchange experiences. Du Qiaoyun (Han nationality), who lived in the same courtyard as her, did not know how to make clothes, so Ma Yuqing patiently taught her in an apprentice-style manner.

    People from All Walks of Life in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing Organize Universal Suffrage Visiting Groups to Visit the Countryside

    People from all walks of life in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing organized universal suffrage visiting groups twice in June and August to go deep into the countryside to visit grassroots elections. They all got a good impression after the visit.

    More than 50 people from democratic parties, religious circles, cultural and educational circles, and industrial and commercial circles participated in the visiting group. The visiting group participated in election meetings and voter group meetings in grassroots election units such as Gonghe Township, Shima Township, and Yinxiang Town in Jiangning County. At the election meeting in the fifth village of Shima Township, people from all walks of life saw that every voter attached great importance to their right to vote. Among the 215 voters in this constituency, 212 participated in the election meeting, and the remaining three voters who could not attend the meeting also asked others to convey their opinions. The serious and earnest discussions of the candidate representatives by the voters of Gonghe Township and Chalucha Township moved people from all walks of life. They believe that the visit has greatly helped them to further understand the essence of the Election Law. Wu Yifang, vice chairman of the Nanjing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said: "From the farmers' discussions, we can see that the Chinese farmers after liberation have truly enjoyed democratic rights, which is a vivid lesson in democracy for us." Christian pastor Li Jian recalled the Kuomintang reactionaries' excuse to deprive professional pastors of their right to vote, and felt even more precious the ability to exercise the right to vote today. Chen Suiheng, chairman of the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "The universality and true promotion of democracy in this universal suffrage is unprecedented in Chinese history." After the visit, people from all walks of life expressed that they would actively participate in the universal suffrage movement with practical actions.

    Now, a group of people in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing are preparing to organize an urban universal suffrage visiting group to visit the urban area of Nanjing.

    天津市各厂工人创造优异的生产成绩来迎接普选
    天津市各工厂工人在迎接普选的热潮中，以国家主人翁的劳动态度，创造了优异的生产成绩。
    国营天津钢厂、华北骨胶厂、天津车辆工厂、私营恒源纺织厂等许多工厂的工人都展开了迎接普选的生产竞赛运动。国营天津车辆工厂杨鑫儒小组的二十八个工人中有十几个人都曾经看见过国民党选举伪国大代表的丑剧。这次他们学习了选举法及有关文件，先后展开了三、四次讨论。他们以亲身体验，深刻地认识到人民民主的可贵，每个人都提出了要以争取超额完成生产计划做为迎接普选的献礼。青年女镟床工田敏，最近刚由学徒升为三级镟床工，她积极地向别人学习技术，顽强地钻研业务，结果产量提高了一倍左右，废品也减少了将近一半。全组提前七天完成了七月份的生产竞赛计划。国营天津机具修造厂木工车间的工人，在迎接普选口号下，创造了“大窗划线机”、“小窗划线机”、
    “钉子压线法”，使工作效率平均提高了三倍。该车间原订七月份完成某项工程的百分之六十五，结果在七月十七日就全部完成了任务。
    曾经在生产上有过突出贡献的各工厂著名的劳动模范们，积极地参加了普选运动。市级特等劳动模范张淑云和孟淑媛，都成了宣传普选的积极分子。全国劳动模范王德山、市特等劳动模范王福元等人并担任了区级选举委员会的委员。国营天津机具修造厂铁工部领工、市一级劳动模范程云汉，在普选开始后，就向铁工部工人宣传普选，并帮助工人迟希尧改进了工作方法，使原订三个月才能完成的工作只用了二十七天就完成了。（新华社）
    归绥市回民自治区妇女积极参加政权工作
    归绥市回民自治区的回族妇女群众，积极参加政权工作，深得各族人民的拥护。据今年七月底统计，已有一百九十三人被选为闾、组长，有十九人被选为区代表和居民委员会主任，占全区闾、组干部总数的百分之六十三强。
    回民女干部对工作认真负责和关心群众生活，是获得群众拥护的主要原因。如该区新民街过去是归绥市最肮脏的地方，但自回族妇女佟玉珍当选闾长、马秀当选居民委员会卫生委员后，便积极领导居民清扫街道垃圾，并把星期五订为爱国卫生日，定期检查；现该街每日集体清理环境卫生已成为习惯，因而获得归绥市卫生模范街的称号。又如该区宽巷子街街道妇联主任马玉清，除积极推行各种工作外，还组织了五个妇女生产小组。她自己到工厂、机关或建筑工地去接衣服、被褥拆洗，并主动团结组员交流经验。和她同院居住的杜巧云（汉民）不会缝制服，马玉清就用带徒弟的方式耐心教会了她。（据新华社讯）
    江苏省和南京市各界人士组织普选参观团到农村参观
    江苏省和南京市的各界人士在六月和八月先后两次组织了普选参观团，深入农村参观基层选举。他们在参观以后都得到良好的印象。
    参加参观团的有各民主党派和宗教界、文教界、工商界人士共五十多人。参观团在江宁县的共和乡、石马乡、殷巷镇等基层选举单位参加了选举大会和选民小组会。在石马乡第五村的选举大会上，各界人士看到每一个选民都非常重视自己的选举权利。这个选区二百十五个选民中有二百十二人参加了选举大会，其余三个不能参加会的选民也请别人转达了自己的意见。共和乡和岔路乡的选民们认真严肃地讨论代表候选人的情形，使各界人士很受感动。他们认为经过参观，对进一步领会选举法的精神实质有很大帮助。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会南京市分会副主席吴贻芳说：“从农民们的讨论中看出解放后的中国农民，已真正享受到民主权利，对我们来讲，是上了一堂生动的民主课。”基督教牧师李既岸回想起国民党反动派藉口剥夺职业牧师的选举权利的事情，更加觉得今天能够行使选举权利的可贵。南京市工商业联合会主任委员陈邃衡说：“这次普选的普遍性和真正的发扬民主，是中国历史上空前未有的事情。”经过参观以后，各界人士都表示要以实际行动积极参加普选运动。
    现在，江苏省和南京市还有一批人士准备组织城市普选参观团到南京市区去参观。
