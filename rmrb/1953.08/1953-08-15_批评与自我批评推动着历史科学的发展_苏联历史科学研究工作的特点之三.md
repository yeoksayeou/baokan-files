Criticism and Self-Criticism Promote the Development of Historical Science
—The Third Characteristic of Soviet Historical Science Research
By Liu Danian, Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Delegation to the Soviet Union

Creative discussion, debate of different opinions, criticism, and self-criticism are tremendous forces driving the development of Soviet science. Advanced Soviet historical science is also developing under the impetus of this force.

Soviet scholars do not view criticism as a means of punishment, as some people mistakenly assume. On the contrary, Soviet scholars believe that criticism is a means of overcoming difficulties on the road to scientific development, a powerful weapon for overcoming everything incompatible with socialism, everything that is old and hinders our rapid progress. It clears the way for the development of science. Scientific endeavors can be developed through criticism and self-criticism, and scientists can also improve their level through this. On this issue, the enemies of the Soviet Union portray the Soviet people as bellicose. Comrade Stalin once pointed out: The issue is not that they are bellicose, but that they are unwilling to return to the old path. They want to build a new society faster, and therefore they must eliminate everything that hinders our progress towards communism. Soviet scholars often cite Comrade Stalin's idea in "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" that science cannot develop without criticism and self-criticism as a lesson and fully apply it in their actions.

Recently, the most important example of criticism and self-criticism in Soviet historiography is the criticism of Bekmakhanov's book "History of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic." For a long time, Bekmakhanov continuously praised the Kazakh feudal Sultan Ginesale Kasimov and his leadership of the movement against the merger of Kazakhstan into Russia in the early 19th century. As early as 1939, Soviet historians began to fight against this nationalist view. At that time, the magazine "Kazakhstan Bolshevik" published an article opposing the historically untrue evaluation of Ginesale and his movement. In 1947, Bekmakhanov wrote another book, "Kazakhstan in the 1920s and 1940s," which praised Ginesale himself and the movement he led even more strongly. After several organized discussions, with the participation of many people, they failed to overcome their bourgeois nationalist views.

On December 26, 1950, the central organ of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, "Pravda," published an article entitled "Struggle for the Marxist-Leninist Interpretation of Historical Issues in Kazakhstan," which dealt a fatal blow to this bourgeois nationalist erroneous ideology. The author of this article analyzed the historical materials related to Ginesale and his movement from a Marxist-Leninist perspective. It pointed out that in the process of Kazakhstan's merger into Russia in the 19th century, the rights and privileges of the Kazakh feudal lords were reduced, and they decided to use the people's dissatisfaction with the Tsarist colonial system to fight for the restoration of the feudal lords' rights. Ginesale launched this movement, and his family and some of the feudal lords' militias formed the main force of this movement. He used intimidation and deception to force the people to join his army, and cruelly suppressed peasants and herdsmen who were unwilling to obey him; on the other hand, he colluded with the Tsarist administrators to seek recognition as Khan. All the materials show that the Ginesale movement was neither revolutionary nor progressive, but a reactionary movement that dragged the Kazakh people backward, consolidated the feudal patriarchal foundation, restored the medieval Khan's regime, and separated Kazakhstan from Russia and the great Russian working people. In his book, Bekmakhanov violated historical facts and attempted to portray Ginesale Kasimov's feudal monarchical movement as a national liberation struggle, and to describe the Ginesale brothers as progressive, almost revolutionary figures. Here, Bekmakhanov ignored the class antagonism in Kazakh society under the feudal patriarchal system. He completely failed to understand the profound progressive significance of Kazakhstan's merger into Russia, and one-sidedly attributed the facts to the colonial system that arose after the merger. The Kazakh working people had a personal stake in Kazakhstan's merger into Russia. The Ginesale movement hindered this merger, which was contrary to the interests of the Kazakh working people.

Soviet historians believe that while Soviet historical science emphasizes the progressiveness of the anti-colonial movement, the reactionary movement of the feudal monarchs and the people's movement against the colonial system are fundamentally different and cannot be confused. The error that occurred in Bekmakhanov's book is the result of the author's failure to understand the nationalist essence of the feudal monarchs, his departure from the scientific stance of Marxism-Leninism, and his use of bourgeois nationalist views to assess historical events.

Similar in nature to the criticism of Bekmakhanov's bourgeois nationalist ideas is the criticism by historians of the Kyrgyz Republic of Professor Bernshtein's historical works. In his "History of the Kyrgyz People," Bernshtein reduced the history of the Kyrgyz people from ancient times to the Great October Socialist Revolution to a history of wars and military conflicts with other nations and tribes, and to descriptions of individual historical figures who launched wars and conflicts. In particular, all the figures who had led military conflicts between the Kyrgyz and other nations or tribes in the past, regardless of the nature of the war, were declared to be progressive activists and people's heroes. In July 1952 and thereafter, the "Soviet Kyrgyzstan" newspaper published articles severely criticizing Bernshtein's mistakes. It pointed out that this was an intolerable distortion of history by bourgeois nationalism, and that the historical narrative deviated from the basic viewpoints of Marxist-Leninist historical science.

The criticism of Bekmakhanov's and Bernshtein's mistakes was carried out under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committees of the Kazakh and Kyrgyz Republics, respectively. The result was not only of great significance for criticizing bourgeois nationalist ideas and correctly using Marxist theory to study history, but also was considered to have an important role in improving the ideological work of the republics.

After the publication of Comrade Stalin's last great work, "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," Soviet historians launched a criticism of the idealist tendencies and economic materialism tendencies in some historical works that did not recognize the objective nature of the laws of historical development. These critical articles were published in the Bolshevik magazine and other important publications, and aroused great attention among Soviet historians.

The effect of criticism and self-criticism on science is extremely significant. Soviet scholars told us that authors who are criticized have an obligation to examine their work based on the criticisms. There are many such facts: after accepting the criticisms and putting in a lot of work again, the authors wrote powerful new works. Creative discussion, criticism, and self-criticism have promoted the development of Soviet historical science.

When conducting criticism and self-criticism, Soviet scholars often adopt two basic forms: one form is to widely solicit opinions before the work is published. For example, researchers at scientific research institutions first present their work to the group for discussion, and then discuss it in a larger group or within the unit. If it is an important work, experts from outside the unit should also be invited to participate in the discussion. After repeated revisions based on the opinions of all parties, the work can be published. Their reason is that the more prior discussions, the greater the correctness of the viewpoints, and the more in line with the interests of the people. In this sense, the work of any person is collective in nature. Another form, which is also the highest form of criticism and self-criticism in Soviet scientific work, is the scientific discussion meeting widely used in the Soviet scientific community. These discussion meetings are included in the annual plans of the units. For example, the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of History's plan for scientific discussion meetings in 1953 included a discussion meeting on the history of the Baltic coastal countries in March, and a discussion meeting on the second volume of Latvian history in May. For example, the Institute of Oriental Studies' plan for scientific discussion meetings this year includes a discussion meeting on land issues in Oriental countries, and a discussion meeting exposing the service of social democratic parties in Oriental countries for the interests of imperialism.

Regarding how to organize criticism and self-criticism, the experience of Soviet historians is that it takes more work to organize self-criticism. Criticism only needs to correctly point out the mistakes of others, while self-criticism must not only admit mistakes, but also propose solutions. Soviet scholars point out that in organizing discussions, do not be afraid of differences of opinion. Only through debate of different opinions can the nature of a problem be clarified. Experience has also proven that in order for a discussion meeting to achieve results, the logic of the meeting is to draw conclusions. In this regard, sometimes such phenomena also occur: problems are discussed but cannot be resolved. However, after debate, it is often possible to open up new avenues for solving these problems. An important link in holding a good scientific discussion meeting is to do a good job of preparation, to publish articles with different viewpoints, so that everyone understands what kind of problem is to be discussed and why these problems are to be discussed. At the same time, Soviet scholars very much emphasize that in order to draw scientific conclusions from every debate, it is necessary to strictly follow scientific principles and adopt a realistic attitude.

In short, conducting criticism and self-criticism seriously and extensively is an important characteristic of advanced Soviet historical science and historians. It has brought brilliant achievements to Soviet historical science, and it is also promoting Soviet historical science to new heights. There is no doubt that our Chinese historians urgently need to learn from the example of Soviet scholars and correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism in order to effectively promote the development of Chinese historical science.

    批评与自我批评推动着历史科学的发展
    ——苏联历史科学研究工作的特点之三
    中国科学院访苏代表团团员  刘大年
    创造性的讨论，不同意见的争论，批评与自我批评，是推动苏维埃科学发展的巨大力量。先进的苏联历史科学也正是在这种力量推动下发展起来的。
    苏联学者对于批评与自我批评的看法，并不是像有些人所错误地设想的那样，以为批评是一种惩罚的手段。完全不是这样，苏联学者认为批评是一种克服科学发展道路上的困难的手段，是克服一切和社会主义不相容的、衰老的、妨害我们迅速前进的东西的有力武器。它为科学的发展廓清道路。科学事业可以在批评与自我批评中得到发展，科学家也可以由此提高自己的水平。在这个问题上，苏联的敌人把苏联人民描写成为好斗成性的人。斯大林同志曾指出：问题完全不在于他们好斗成性，问题在于他们不愿意回到旧的道路上去。他们想更快地建设新社会，因此就要祛除一切妨害我们向共产主义前进的东西。苏联学者经常引证斯大林同志的“马克思主义与语言学问题”著作中关于没有批评与自我批评就不能发展科学的思想作为教训；并在他们的行动中充分地加以运用。
    近来苏联史学界最重要的批评与自我批评的事例，是关于别克马汉诺夫写的“哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国历史”一书的批评。别克马汉诺夫曾在长时期内不断地歌颂十九世纪初叶的哈萨克封建苏丹盖涅萨勒·卡塞莫夫及其领导的反对哈萨克斯坦合并于俄国的运动。早在一九三九年，苏联史学家中就开始了反对这一民族主义观点的斗争。当时“哈萨克斯坦布尔什维克”杂志曾登载论文，反对关于盖涅萨勒及其运动的违反历史真实的评价。一九四七年，别克马汉诺夫又写了“十九世纪二十年代至四十年代的哈萨克斯坦”一书，对盖涅萨勒本人及其所领导的运动称颂更为厉害了。中间经过几次组织讨论，有不少的人参加，但没有使他们克服资产阶级民族主义观点。
    一九五○年十二月二十六日苏联共产党中央机关报“真理报”发表了“为马克思列宁主义地阐明哈萨克斯坦底历史问题而斗争”一文，给了这种资产阶级民族主义错误思想以致命的打击。这篇文章的作者用马克思列宁主义观点分析了和盖涅萨勒及其运动有关的历史资料。指出十九世纪哈萨克合并于俄国的过程中，哈萨克封建主的权利和特权被缩小了，他们决定利用人民对沙皇殖民制度的不满，来为恢复封建主的权利而进行斗争。盖涅萨勒发动了这个运动，并由他的家族和一些封建主的乡勇组成这个运动的主力。他对人民是用恐吓和欺骗的方法，强迫他们加入自己的军队，残酷镇压那些不愿服从他的农民和牧民；而另一方面，又和沙皇的行政长官相勾结，争取承认他为汗。全部材料说明：盖涅萨勒运动既不是革命的，也不是进步的，是一个将哈萨克人民拉向后退，巩固封建宗法的基础，使中世纪汗的政权复辟，并使哈萨克斯坦脱离俄国和伟大俄罗斯劳动人民的反动运动。别克马汉诺夫在他的著作里，违反历史事实，企图把盖涅萨勒·卡塞莫夫的封建君主运动说成是民族解放斗争，把盖涅萨勒兄弟描写成为进步的，几乎是革命的人物。在这里，别克马汉诺夫忽视了封建宗法制度下的哈萨克社会中的阶级对立。他完全没有了解到哈萨克斯坦合并于俄国的深刻的进步意义，片面地把事实归结于合并以后产生的殖民制度。哈萨克劳动人民对哈萨克斯坦的合并于俄国，有着切身的利害关系。盖涅萨勒运动则阻碍了这一合并，这是和哈萨克劳动人民的利益相违反的。
    苏联史学家认为：苏联的历史科学强调反殖民运动的进步性，但是封建君主的反动运动和反对殖民制度的人民运动是根本不能混为一谈的。像别克马汉诺夫的著作中所发生的错误，是作者没有懂得封建君主的民族主义实质，离开了马克思列宁主义的科学立场，用资产阶级民族主义的观点来估量历史事件的结果。
    和批评别克马汉诺夫的资产阶级民族主义思想的性质相同的，还有吉尔吉斯加盟共和国的历史学家对别恩什坦教授的历史著作的批评。别恩什坦在他的“吉尔吉斯人民的历史”一书中，把从远古到伟大十月社会主义革命为止的吉尔吉斯人民的历史，归结为和其他民族与部落的战争、军事冲突史，归结为对于发动战争和冲突的个别历史人物的描写。特别是把所有过去领导过吉尔吉斯人和其他民族或部落的军事冲突的人物，不论战争性质如何，一律宣布为进步活动家、人民英雄。一九五二年七月和这以后，“苏维埃吉尔吉斯”报曾发表专文，严厉批评别恩什坦的错误。指出这是资产阶级民族主义对历史不可容忍的歪曲，在历史的叙述上离开了马克思列宁主义历史科学的基本观点。
    对别克马汉诺夫和别恩什坦的错误的批评，是分别在哈萨克和吉尔吉斯共和国党中央的直接领导下进行的。其结果不但对于批判资产阶级民族主义思想，正确地运用马克思主义理论来研究历史有很大的意义，而且对于改进共和国的思想工作，也被认为有重要的作用。
    斯大林同志最后的伟大著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”发表以后，苏联史学界对某些历史著作中不承认历史发展法则的客观性质的唯心论倾向和经济唯物主义倾向展开了批评。这些批评文章发表在布尔什维克杂志和其他重要刊物上，曾引起了苏联史学家很大的注意。
    批评与自我批评在科学上所产生的效果是极其显著的。苏联学者告诉我们，凡是被批评的作者，有义务根据批评意见来检查自己的工作。有许许多多这样的事实：作者接受批评意见，重新付出大量劳动之后，写出了有力量的新的作品。创造性的讨论，批评与自我批评，推动了苏联历史科学的发展。
    进行批评与自我批评时，苏联学者经常采用两种基本形式：一种形式是著作没有发表以前，广泛地征求意见。例如科学研究机关的研究人员，先把自己的作品提到小组上去讨论，然后在大组或本单位讨论。如果是重要的著作，还应该约请本单位以外的专家在一起讨论。根据各方面的意见反复修改以后，这个著作才能出版。他们的理由是：事前的讨论越多，观点的正确性才越大，越符合于人民利益。在这个意义上，任何人的著作都是集体性质的。另一种形式，也是苏联科学工作中开展批评与自我批评的最高形式，就是苏联科学界广泛利用的科学讨论会。这种讨论会是列入本单位的年度计划内的。例如苏联科学院历史研究所一九五三年度的科学讨论会计划中，有三月间举行的关于波罗的海沿岸各国历史讨论会，有五月间举行的拉脱维亚史第二卷讨论会等。又如东方学研究所今年的科学讨论会计划中，有关于东方各国土地问题的讨论会，揭发东方各国社会民主党为帝国主义的利益服务的讨论会等等。
    对于如何组织批评与自我批评，苏联史学家们的经验是，组织自我批评要多做一些工作，批评只须正确指出别人的错误，自我批评则除了要承认错误，还要提出改正办法。苏联学者指出：在组织讨论时，不要害怕意见分歧，一个问题只有经过不同意见的争论，才能把性质弄得更加明确。经验也证明：要使讨论会获得结果，会议的逻辑就是作出结论。在这方面，有时也会发生这样的现象：讨论了问题而不能得到解决。但经过争论以后，往往可以为解决这些问题开辟新的途径。开好科学讨论会的重要环节是做好准备工作，把不同观点的文章公布，让大家都明白所要讨论的是什么样的问题，为什么要讨论这些问题。与此同时，苏联学者们非常强调，要对每一争论作出科学的结论，必须严格遵循科学的原则，采取实事求是的态度。
    总之，严肃认真地、广泛地进行批评与自我批评，是先进的苏联历史科学和历史学家们的重要特点。它为苏联历史科学带来了光辉的成就，也推动着苏联的历史科学向新的高峰前进。毫无疑问的，我们中国的史学工作者，目前十分需要学习苏联学者的榜样，正确地开展批评与自我批评，来有效地推动中国历史科学的发展。
