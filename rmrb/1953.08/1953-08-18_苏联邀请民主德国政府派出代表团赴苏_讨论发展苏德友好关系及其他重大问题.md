　　Discussing the Development of Soviet-German Friendship and Other Important Issues
　　[Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] TASS, Moscow, August 17th: On August 15th, Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov received Rudolf Appelt, the head of the diplomatic mission of the German Democratic Republic to the Soviet Union, and informed him of the following:
　　The Soviet government has decided to invite a delegation from the German government to the Soviet Union on August 20th. The Soviet government issued this invitation because it believes that at the present time, it is appropriate to study certain major issues concerning the development of relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, as well as urgent issues concerning the whole of Germany.
　　Before the delegation of the German Democratic Republic government arrives in Moscow, the Soviet government intends to send a note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, explaining the Soviet Union's attitude towards the German issue and putting forward corresponding Soviet proposals.
　　The arrival of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic government in the Soviet Union will enable the two countries to thoroughly discuss the German issue and, as the Soviet government hopes, will become another important stage in the further development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.
　　Appelt said that he would convey this invitation to the government of the German Democratic Republic.

    苏联邀请民主德国政府派出代表团赴苏
    讨论发展苏德友好关系及其他重大问题
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日电：八月十五日，苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫接见德意志民主共和国驻苏联外交使团团长鲁道夫·阿佩尔特，通知他以下事项：
    苏联政府已决定邀请德国政府派出一个代表团在八月二十日到苏联。苏联政府之所以发出这个邀请，乃是因为它认为，在目前这时候研究一下有关发展苏联与德意志民主共和国关系的某些重大问题以及有关整个德国问题的迫切问题，是合宜的。
    在德意志民主共和国政府代表团到达莫斯科以前，苏联政府打算发一个照会给美、英、法三国政府，说明苏联对德国问题的态度，并提出苏联相应的建议。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表团到达苏联，将使两国可能详尽地讨论德国问题，并如苏联政府所希望的那样，将成为苏联与德意志民主共和国更进一步发展友好关系的另一个重要阶段。
    阿佩尔特说，他将把这个邀请转告德意志民主共和国政府。
