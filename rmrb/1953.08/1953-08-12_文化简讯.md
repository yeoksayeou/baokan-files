Tianjin First Military Medical University Clinical College Achieves Significant Results in Pilot Sleep Therapy

The Clinical College of Tianjin First Military Medical University is using the advanced Soviet medical experience of sleep therapy to treat neurasthenia, hypertension, gastric and duodenal ulcers, neurogenic stomach pain, hiccups, vomiting, ulcerative colitis, schizophrenia, mania, manic-depressive psychosis, hysteria, migraines, causalgia, sympathetic dysfunction, residual limb pain, phantom limb pain, post-concussion syndrome, spasmodic torticollis, stuttering, and other conditions, with significant results.

According to the college's statistics, sleep therapy has achieved good results in 80 percent of cases involving the aforementioned difficult and complicated diseases. For example, some patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers did not see improvement after treatments such as "diet therapy," "alkaline drug therapy," "surgical therapy," "tissue therapy," and "autologous blood therapy." However, after sleep therapy, seven out of twenty-three patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers were cured, fourteen improved, and only two showed no effect. In addition, acute manic and hysterical patients recovered their health after sleep therapy.

Sleep therapy is a comprehensive therapy that cannot rely solely on "sleep" for treatment. In addition to formal treatment, the environment of all wards and the attitude of the treatment staff are closely related to the therapeutic effect. In order to reduce the side effects that occur during drug-induced hypnosis, the college uses the advanced Soviet hospital experience of conditioned stimuli for sleep therapy. For example, improving ward facilities and adding automatic record players to play lullabies or monotonous rhythms (such as the sound of rain or the sound of a speeding train) to hypnotize patients. This can save on medication, avoid adverse side effects, reduce the economic burden on patients, and improve the therapeutic effect.

Northwest Nationalities Institute Trains Large Numbers of Ethnic Minority Cadres

The Northwest Nationalities Institute was established in 1950. Its mission is to train ethnic minority cadres from all parts of Northwest China so that they can assume responsibility for developing the political, economic, cultural, and educational undertakings of their respective ethnic groups after graduation. The predecessor of the Northwest Nationalities Institute was the "Tibetan People's Problems Research Class," with more than ten students. With the support of the Party and the People's Government, it has now developed into a large-scale ethnic cadre school encompassing sixteen ethnic groups and more than 1,300 people in Northwest China. In the past three years, it has trained more than 1,800 cadres for the people of all ethnic groups in Northwest China.

The Northwest Nationalities Institute is divided into the following three parts: (1) Administrative Cadre Training Class: Specially designed to train in-service cadres from ethnic minority autonomous regions and districts/counties, and to recruit intellectuals, young activists, and religious figures from various ethnic groups such as Qianbaihu, Wanggong, Living Buddhas, Lamas, Ahongs, and chieftains to participate in learning. The study period is six months. (2) Undergraduate Program: Divided into the following four departments: 1. Department of Languages: Trains ethnic minority language translation cadres. Currently, there are three groups: Tibetan, Mongolian, and Uyghur. Next semester, it will be expanded into three departments: Tibetan, Mongolian, and Uyghur. The study period is three years. 2. Department of Politics: Trains ethnic minority administrative cadres. The study period is two years. 3. Department of Law: Trains ethnic minority judicial cadres at the county, city, and district levels. The study period is two years. 4. Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine: Trains intermediate animal husbandry and veterinary technicians from ethnic minorities. The study period is three years. (3) Preparatory Course: A preparatory class for the undergraduate program, specifically designed to train young people under the age of 20 from various ethnic groups. After a certain period of study, they can advance to various departments of the undergraduate program for further study, and become the backbone of the construction undertakings of the people of all ethnic groups in Northwest China in the future.

    天津第一军医大学临床学院试行睡眠疗法收效显著
    天津第一军医大学临床学院运用苏联的先进医学经验——睡眠疗法，治疗神经衰弱、高血压、胃及十二指肠溃疡、神经官能性胃疼、呃逆、呕吐、溃疡性结肠炎、精神分裂症、躁狂症、郁躁症、歇斯底里、偏头痛、灼性神经痛、交感神经机能失调症、残肢神经痛、幻痛症、脑震荡后遗症、阵挛性斜颈、口吃等症，有显著结果。
    据该院的统计，用睡眠疗法治疗上述疑难病症，百分之八十的病例获得良好效果。例如，有些患胃及十二指肠溃疡的病人，虽经“饮食疗法”、“硷性药物疗法”、“外科手术疗法”、“组织疗法”、“自家血液疗法”等治疗，病情并无好转，但经过睡眠疗法治疗后，二十三名患胃及十二指肠溃疡的病人中就有七名痊愈，十四名改善，仅两名无效。此外，急性躁狂及歇斯底里病人经睡眠疗法治疗后，都恢复了健康。
    睡眠疗法是一种综合性的疗法，不能单靠“睡眠”来治疗，因为除了实行正式的治疗外，所有病房的环境、治疗人员的态度等，都和治疗效果密切相关的。为了减少在进行药物催眠时所发生的副作用，该院就用苏联医院的先进经验的条件刺激来做睡眠疗法。如改进病室装置，并添设自动留声机，播送催眠曲或单调音律（如下雨声、火车疾驰声），来给病人催眠。这样既可以节省药物用量，避免不良的副作用，又可减轻病人的经济负担，提高治疗效果。

    西北民族学院分设以下三个部分：（一）行政干部训练班：专门轮训各民族自治区和区、县在职干部，并招收各族知识分子、青年积极分子和宗教界人士如千百户、王公、活佛、喇嘛、阿訇、头人等参加学习。学习时间为六个月。（二）本科：分设下列四系：一、语文系：培养少数民族的语文翻译干部。目前设藏文、蒙文、维文三组，下学期将扩充为藏文、蒙文、维文三系。学习时间为三年。二、政治系：培养少数民族的行政干部。学习时间为二年。三、司法系：调训县、市、区级少数民族司法干部。学习时间为二年。四、畜牧兽医系：培养少数民族的中级畜牧兽医技术干部。学习时间为三年。（三）预科：是本科的预备班，专门培养各民族二十岁以下的青年。经过一定时期的学习后，他们可升入本科各系深造，将来成为西北各族人民建设事业中的骨干。
    西北民族学院表现了西北各民族的特点。各民族的语言文字、文化艺术和历史传统都得到大大的发扬；各民族的宗教信仰和风俗习惯都受到充分的尊重和照顾。
