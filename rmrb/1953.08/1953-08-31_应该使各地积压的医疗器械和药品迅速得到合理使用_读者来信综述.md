    Accumulated Medical Equipment and Medicines in Various Places Should Be Put to Rational Use Quickly
    -- Reader's Letters Summary
    Recently, we have received many letters from readers exposing the serious waste of large quantities of medicines and medical equipment accumulated by certain medical and health departments. For example, Zhang Hongshou of Jiangsu Medical College wrote that in January and February 1953, Jiangsu Medical College found more than 500,000 tablets of 0.1 gram Atabrine accumulated in the pharmacy during an inventory of assets. If calculated based on the current drug consumption of the college, this batch of drugs is estimated to last for 100 years; in addition, accumulated drugs such as Pyrimethamine, Aspirin, Sodium Sulfate, and Magnesium Hydroxide can also be used for decades. According to his understanding, Yangming Hospital in Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, also has about 100,000 tablets of Aspirin accumulated. Reader Lü Zhenxi reported that the former North China Ordnance Bureau purchased 800 million yuan worth of medicines at the end of 1950 under the influence of the idea of "buying whatever is available"; after deducting the consumed portion, medicines worth about 500 million yuan are still accumulated. A reader from Beijing Medical College reported that they have more than 20 boxes of medicines received from the Japanese puppet regime, but their purpose is still unclear and no one cares about them. The accumulation of medical equipment is also serious. Zhang Hongbin from Wuxian County Health Center in Jiangsu Province wrote that the center arbitrarily diverted a large amount of funds originally intended to establish ten district health stations last year to purchase a complete set of surgical equipment, universal operating tables, electrotherapy equipment, and even "X-ray machines". In fact, none of the doctors in this health center understand how to use the "X-ray machine" technology, and there are no suitable houses to install it. These medical equipment have become useless and accumulated. Reader Luo Yingcai reported that Fuyang Prefectural Hospital in Anhui Province purchased brand-new electrotherapy equipment (such as short-wave diathermy machines, electric centrifuges, refrigerators, etc.), but Fuyang County city is stopped for electricity during the day, and even if electricity is supplied at night, the power is very weak. These valuable electrotherapy equipment cannot be used at all and have to be sent to the warehouse for storage. A reader from Shanxi University reported that the school's medical room purchased an exquisite operating table (the front, middle, and rear parts can be rotated arbitrarily) for 14 million yuan, but no one in the medical room can perform surgery. This bed can only be used as an ordinary bed for patients to lie on for injections.
    Readers suggested that in order to make the country's assets play a role, this batch of accumulated materials should be rationally allocated quickly. In fact, many materials (especially medicines) have deteriorated and become ineffective due to long-term accumulation. If they continue to be accumulated, it will inevitably cause greater losses. This suggestion from the readers is correct. It is hoped that the Central Ministry of Health and relevant departments will pay attention to this issue and quickly study specific methods for handling accumulated materials.

### 应该使各地积压的医疗器械和药品迅速得到合理使用——读者来信综述

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应该使各地积压的医疗器械和药品迅速得到合理使用
    ——读者来信综述
    近来，我们收到很多读者来信揭发某些医疗、卫生部门，积压大批药品和医疗器械的严重浪费情况。例如，江苏医学院张鸿寿来信反映，一九五三年一、二月间，江苏医学院在清点资财工作中，发现药库积压零点一克的阿的平五十余万片。这批药品如果按该院目前药品消耗量计，估计可用一百年；此外，积压的扑疟母星、阿司匹灵、硫酸纳、氢氧化镁等药品，亦可用数十年。据他了解，浙江余姚阳明医院也积压了阿司匹灵约十万片。读者吕振溪反映：前华北兵工局于一九五○年底，在“有啥买啥”的思想支配下，购买了八亿元的药品；除去耗用的以外，目前尚积压了价值约五亿元的药品，北京医学院一读者反映，他们那里存有二十多箱日伪时期接收过来的药品，至今不明用途，无人过问。医疗器械的积压情况也是严重的。江苏省吴县卫生院张宏彬来信反映，该院在去年擅自挪用原拟建立十个区保健站的大笔经费，购买了全套外科开刀设备、万能手术床、电疗器以至“X光机”等。实际上，这个卫生院并没有一个大夫懂得使用“X光机”的技术，也没有适当的房子可以安装，这些医疗器械，就变成无用之物被积压下来。读者罗英彩反映，安徽阜阳专署医院购置了全新电疗设备（如超短波电疗器、电动离心器、电冰箱等等），但阜阳县城白天是停止送电的，即使晚上送电电力也很弱，这些贵重的电疗设备根本不能使用，只好送进库房保存。山西大学一读者反映，该校医疗室以一千四百万元购买了一张精致的手术床（前、中、后部可以任意转动），但医疗室并无人能动手术，这张床只好当普通的床用来给病人垫着打针。
    读者提出：为了使国家资财发挥作用，这批积压物资应该迅速作合理的调配。事实上，许多物资（尤其是药品）因长期积压已经变质、失效，如果再积压下去，势必造成更大的损失。读者这个建议是正确的。希望中央卫生部与有关部门重视这个问题，并迅速研究处理积压物资的具体办法。
