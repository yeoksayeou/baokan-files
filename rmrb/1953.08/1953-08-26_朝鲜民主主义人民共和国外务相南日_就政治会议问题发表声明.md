(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 25th) Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement on the issue of the Political Conference on August 25th. The full text is as follows:

    The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, paying close attention to the current discussions in the United Nations General Assembly on the issue of the political conference, hereby authorizes me to make the following statement regarding the statement made by Mr. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, on August 24, 1953, on the issue of the political conference:

    The Korean armistice must be the first step towards a peaceful settlement of the Korean question and the peaceful reunification of Korea, thereby easing all international tensions. This is the unwavering belief of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The political conference must promote the realization of these goals and play such a far-reaching role, thereby becoming a model for holding conferences in a spirit of consultation and resolving international disputes peacefully.

    For such purposes, as for the form of the political conference, it is appropriate to adopt the form of a round table conference, with the participation of both parties to the Korean armistice and other relevant countries, to jointly consult. However, we believe that any resolution of the conference can only be established with the unanimous agreement of both parties to the Korean armistice. As for the scope of authority of the political conference, we believe that, according to Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops (including the United Nations forces and the Chinese People's Volunteers) from Korea, and the issue of a peaceful settlement of the Korean question, should be discussed first, and then other issues.

    Regarding the composition of the political conference, we believe that the proposal made by Mr. Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet government delegation to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on August 18, 1953, regarding the composition of the political conference, is in line with the above-mentioned position of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the political conference, and we support this proposal.

    Regarding the form of the political conference, the procedures for passing resolutions, the scope of authority of the political conference, and the composition of the political conference, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has completely consistent views with the government of the People's Republic of China, and fully supports the aforementioned statement by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China on the issue of the political conference.

    We believe that it is unreasonable for the current United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Korean issue without the participation of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and representatives of the People's Republic of China.
    Pyongyang, Korea, August 25, 1953

    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日
    就政治会议问题发表声明
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日在八月二十五日就政治会议问题发表声明，全文如下：
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府注视着目前联合国大会关于政治会议问题的讨论，特授权本人就中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来先生在一九五三年八月二十四日发表的关于政治会议问题的声明，发表如下的声明：
    朝鲜停战必须成为和平解决朝鲜问题与和平统一朝鲜、从而缓和国际局势的一切紧张性的第一步。这是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府不可动摇的信念。政治会议必须促进这些目标的实现，起这样意义深远的作用，从而成为以协商精神举行会议、和平地解决国际争端的模范。
    为了这样的目的，就政治会议的形式来说，以采取圆桌会议的形式，在朝鲜停战双方及其他有关国家参加之下，共同协商为适当。但是，我们认为：会议的任何决议，只有在取得朝鲜停战双方的一致同意时，才能成立。至于政治会议的职权范围，我们认为：根据朝鲜停战协定第六十款，应首先讨论一切外国军队（包括联合国军和中国人民志愿军在内）从朝鲜撤退的问题，与朝鲜问题的和平解决的问题，然后再讨论其他问题。
    关于政治会议的组成，我们认为，一九五三年八月十八日苏联政府代表团团长维辛斯基先生在联合国大会政治委员会上提出的关于政治会议组成的提议，符合以上所述的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对于政治会议的立场，我们支持这个提议。
    关于政治会议的形式、通过决议的程序、政治会议的职权范围以及政治会议的组成，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府有着和中华人民共和国政府完全一致的见解，并完全支持上述中华人民共和国周恩来外交部长关于政治会议问题的声明。
    我们认为：现在举行的联合国大会，关于朝鲜问题的讨论，不让朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表和中华人民共和国代表参加，是不合理的。一九五三年八月二十五日朝鲜平壤
