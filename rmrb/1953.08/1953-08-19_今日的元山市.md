    Today, the heroic port of Wonsan on Korea's east coast, after the armistice, presents a scene of new life. The people of Wonsan, who made outstanding contributions in the war against aggression, are using their hardworking hands and strong will to heal the enormous wounds the city suffered in the war.

    Wonsan suffered severe damage in the three-year war against aggression. According to incomplete statistics, from January 1952 until the armistice, the American aggressor troops' warships and airplanes fired more than 110,000 shells and dropped more than 41,000 bombs on this, North Korea's second largest city. The city's residences, factories, and schools were bombed into ruins, and the entire urban area was riddled with shell craters. However, the people of Wonsan are unyielding. With their tenacious fighting spirit, they moved the city underground and continued to wage a heroic struggle against the enemy.

    After the armistice, the people of Wonsan immediately began the enormous task of recovery with the same perseverance. More than 20,000 citizens participated in the labor of filling in bomb and shell craters in the city. Many women, elderly people, and children enthusiastically filled basket after basket of soil into the huge craters. On July 30, the "August 15th" Liberation Memorial Tower Square, riddled with craters, had been repaired with a completely new look. On this day, more than 40,000 citizens of Wonsan held a grand rally on this new square to celebrate the armistice.

    The city's largest theater—the open-air theater—has been re-equipped with bright electric lights.

    In early August, the Sixth Delegation of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea for Artistic Performances gave a performance of consolation here to the heroic people of Wonsan.

    The restoration and reconstruction of Wonsan's streets are also proceeding rapidly throughout the city. Vehicles transporting materials busily shuttle along the city's main streets. New wooden houses have already begun to be built on the ruins. Carpenters and construction workers are rushing to make desks and chairs for offices and repair the huge buildings that were not completely destroyed. Many workers are actively repairing the office building of the Workers' Party of Korea, Kangwon Province Committee. This building, which had become dilapidated under the bombardment of countless shells from the invaders, has been re-equipped with floors and doors and windows. In the future factory area, many workers from underground factories are surveying the factory foundations, and in some places, the labor of building the factory foundations has already begun.

    Wonsan's port is also bustling. Various ships flying the flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are sailing in the clear green sea. They are continuously transporting large quantities of materials to some of the islands that have been recovered outside the port. The Wonsan Railway Station in the port is also being repaired. In the week after the armistice, the heroic railway workers repaired a comfortable waiting room for passengers. Passenger trains from Wonsan to Pyongyang are already running, and large numbers of passengers get on and off here every day. A large amount of construction equipment is also being continuously transported to this heroic city.

    The city's cultural and sports venues are also being rapidly restored. Various ball fields, tracks, and high jump bars have been rebuilt on the Wonsan Stadium. The victorious people also placed many colorful banners on the rostrum, and in the center of the stage stood huge portraits of the leaders of various fraternal countries. On July 31 and August 1, more than 10,000 citizens participated in the first large-scale sports meet in three years.

    Today, this heroic city—Wonsan—is filled with moving enthusiasm for construction. People love the constructive labor of restoring a better life. But people will never forget the brutality of the invaders. While actively building, people remain highly vigilant. The huge muzzles of the coastal guns still point vigilantly at the distant ocean. Fully armed coastal defense soldiers are vigilantly patrolling the forward positions. The people of Wonsan understand the value of peace, and therefore, they also know how to defend peace.

    今日的元山市
    新华社记者  张结、谢芝麟
    今日，停战后的朝鲜东海岸上的英雄港——元山市，呈现了一片新生气象。在反侵略战争中有着卓越贡献的元山人民，正在用自己勤劳的双手和坚强的意志，医治着这座城市在战争中所遭受的巨大创伤。
    元山在三年来的反侵略战争中遭受了严重的破坏。据不完全统计，从一九五二年一月到停战以前，美国侵略军的军舰和飞机就向这座北朝鲜的第二大城发射了十一万多发炮弹、投掷了四万一千多枚炸弹。全市的住宅、工厂和学校被炸成了一片废墟，整个市区弹痕累累。但是，元山人民是不屈的。他们用顽强的战斗精神，将城市迁入了地下，继续和敌人进行英勇的斗争。
    停战以后，元山人民立刻用同样坚毅的劳动开始了巨大的恢复工作。二万多市民参加了填平市内炸弹、炮弹坑的劳动。许多妇女、老人和小孩们紧张而兴奋地把一筐筐土块填进巨大的弹坑。七月三十日，弹坑累累的“八·一五”解放纪念塔广场，已经被修理得面貌一新。就在这天，四万多元山市民就在这片新的广场上举行了庆祝停战的大会。
    市内最大的剧场——露天剧场重新装起了明亮的电灯。
    八月上旬，中国人民赴朝慰问文艺工作团第六团，曾在这里向英雄的元山人民作了慰问演出。
    元山市街道的恢复和重建工作也在整个市区内迅速地进行着。市内大街上忙碌地奔驶着搬运物资的车辆。废墟上已经开始建立起一所所新的木房。木工和建筑工们正在赶制机关办公用的桌椅和修整着巨大的、未被完全炸毁的楼房。许多工人正在积极修理着劳动党江原道委员会的办公大楼。这座在侵略者无数炮弹的轰击下变成残破不堪的大楼，已经重新装上了地板和门窗。在未来的工厂区，许多来自地下工厂的工作人员正在勘察厂基，有的地方已经开始了修建厂基的劳动。
    元山的港口也活跃起来了。在碧绿的海水中，行驶着插有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗的各种船只。它们正源源不断地把大量物资运送到港外已经收回的一些岛屿上去。港口内的元山火车站也正在着手修复。英勇的铁路工人们在停战后的一个星期中，就为旅客修理了一座舒适的候车室。元山到平壤的客车已经通车了，每天都有大批乘客在这里上车和下车。每天还有大批的建设器材被不断地运送到这座英雄的城市里来。
    市内的文化体育场所也在迅速地恢复着。元山市体育场上各种球场、跑道和跳高栏又修起来了。胜利的人民还在主席台上插上了许多五彩缤纷的锦旗，在台的中间树立着各兄弟国家领袖的巨幅画像。七月三十一日和八月一日，有一万多市民在这里参加了三年来第一次规模盛大的运动会。
    今天，这座英雄的城市——元山，到处充满了令人感动的建设热情。人们热爱恢复美好生活的建设性的劳动。但是人们永远也不会忘记侵略者的兽行。人们在积极建设的同时，仍保持着高度的警惕。海岸炮的巨大炮口，仍警惕地指着遥远的海洋。全副武装的海防战士们，正警惕地巡逻在前哨阵地上。元山人民懂得和平的可贵，因此，他们也就懂得如何来保卫和平。
