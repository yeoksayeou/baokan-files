Column: Responses to Criticisms and Suggestions from People's Daily Readers

    The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on May 15th published several letters from readers exposing violations of labor policies by certain enterprises when recruiting workers, under the title "The Chaotic Phenomenon in Worker Recruitment Should Be Stopped." Now, we are publishing the opinions of the General Office of the Central People's Government Ministry of Labor on this issue and excerpts from the reply letters of the relevant units:

    Letter from the General Office of the Central People's Government Ministry of Labor: "Certain enterprises, without going through the labor departments and without legal procedures, privately recruit employed workers, arbitrarily recruit workers and apprentices, or privately recruit students, resulting in workers jumping from factory to factory, affecting school teaching, and causing the blind influx of rural labor into cities, creating chaotic phenomena. Regarding the above-mentioned behavior, the Ministry issued a circular to local labor administrative departments in September 1951, requiring them to take effective measures to strictly prohibit it. However, wage standards have not yet been unified across regions, and with the development of production and construction, there is an even greater shortage of technical staff. Due to the lack of overall perspective of some enterprises and insufficient class education for workers, incidents of poaching and jumping factories continue to occur. In order to cooperate with national economic construction and assist enterprises in completing production tasks, in addition to helping various industrial departments cultivate a large number of skilled workers, unifying technical grade wage standards, and strengthening education for enterprises and workers through relevant departments, the Ministry will again notify local labor administrative departments to pay close attention to this issue; those who violate the unified labor allocation regulations and entice employed workers should be appropriately punished."

    The Zhengzhou City Labor Bureau reported the results of handling the issue of the state-owned Zhengzhou Cotton Textile Factory privately recruiting employed workers. The letter stated: "In August and September of last year, the state-owned Zhengzhou Cotton Textile Factory (hereinafter referred to as Zhengzhou Factory) privately hired eight skilled workers from the Shaanxi Xinqin Company Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory (hereinafter referred to as Xinqin Factory) through the relationship of Zhang Chengxiang, the director of the Zhengzhou Factory's workshop. In October of last year and February of this year, Xinqin Factory sent cadres to Zhengzhou twice to find these workers. Although our bureau assisted, the problem could not be resolved because Zhengzhou Factory concealed the truth and adopted an attitude of confrontation towards the government's handling. Our bureau submitted this issue to the Municipal People's Supervisory Committee for handling and also reported it to the higher-level Party committee. In April, under the direction of the higher-level Party committee, the Municipal Party Committee's Industry Department organized an inspection team including the Municipal People's Government, the Municipal People's Supervisory Committee, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and our bureau to conduct an in-depth inspection of the Zhengzhou Factory. Now the situation has been clarified. The Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee and the Municipal People's Supervisory Committee have studied the issue and made separate decisions. In addition to ordering Zhengzhou Factory to be responsible for mobilizing the recruited workers to return to Xinqin Factory and thoroughly inspect and correct similar situations, the factory director Dou Xiuyan and deputy factory director Zhang Zhiping (both Party members) have been given a public warning within the Party and an administrative demerit; workshop director Zhang Chengxiang has been given an administrative warning. Dou Xiuyan and Zhang Zhiping have also made written self-criticisms. Now, five of the eight workers recruited by Zhengzhou Factory have been mobilized to return, and three workers are willing to resign rather than return to the Northwest. This issue has now been resolved."

    The First Detachment of the Third Survey and Design Team of the Ministry of Railways sent a letter responding to the issue of the detachment recruiting students to participate in work. The letter stated:

    "Zhou Naizhi, a student from Zhangjiabu Complete Primary School in the Third District of Jimo County, and others participated in the work, not because our team's cadres mobilized them. He inquired about our team's situation from a temporary worker in our team and came to ask to participate in the work four times. The fourth time, he and his classmate Chen Fangmei brought a letter of introduction from the Zhangjiabu Township People's Government requesting to work as temporary workers in our team. Then, the Lanxitou Township People's Government introduced Song Zongmeng to our team as a temporary worker; at that time, our team hired them. Afterwards, we heard that Chen and Song were students and their parents did not agree with them participating in the work, so we persuaded them to go home. Zhou Naizhi's parents did not object, so we sent a letter to solicit the opinions of the district government and asked the general team for instructions on how to handle it. On May 7th, according to the instructions of the general team, we also mobilized Zhou Naizhi to go home. When we hired these three people, we saw that they had letters of introduction from the township government and did not carefully investigate whether they were students, which affected the emotions of other students; and after handling this issue, we did not promptly inform the local people's government of the results. We are determined to correct these shortcomings in future work."

### 中央劳动部等部门对一些乱拉工人问题的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央劳动部等部门对一些乱拉工人问题的答复
    五月十五日“读者来信摘要”栏以“应该制止招聘工人中的混乱现象”为题，刊载了几封读者揭发某些企业单位招聘工人时违反劳动政策的来信。现将中央人民政府劳动部办公厅对这个问题的意见和各有关单位的答复信摘要发表于后：
    中央人民政府劳动部办公厅来信：“某些企业单位，不通过劳动部门和不经过合法手续，私拉在业工人、擅自招收工人和学徒或私拉在校学生，以致造成职工跳厂，影响学校教学和农村劳动力盲目流入城市等混乱现象。对于上述行为，本部曾于一九五一年九月通报各地劳动行政部门采取有效措施严加禁止。但是各地区间工资标准还没有统一，随着生产建设事业的开展而技术员工更感缺乏，由于某些企业单位缺乏整体观念以及对工人的阶级教育进行不够，拉工跳厂事件仍然不断发生。为了配合国家经济建设，协助企业完成生产任务，本部除帮助各产业部门大量培养技术工人，统一技术等级工资标准，通过各有关部门加强对企业和工人的教育工作外，并再行通知各地劳动行政部门对这个问题严加注意；对不遵守劳动力统一调配法令而诱挖在业职工者，应予以适当处分。”
    郑州市劳动局来信报告了对国营郑州棉纺织厂私拉在业工人问题的处理结果。来信说：“我市国营郑州棉纺织厂（以下简称郑州厂）在去年八、九月间，通过该厂车间主任张呈祥的关系，私自挖雇陕西新秦公司纺织印染厂（以下简称新秦厂）的在业技工八人。去年十月与今年二月，新秦厂先后两次派干部来郑州找寻这些工人，虽经我局协助，但因为郑州厂隐瞒真实情况，对政府的处理采取对抗态度，致使问题迟迟不能解决。我局就把这个问题提请市人民监察委员会处理，同时也向上级党委作了报告。四月间，在上级党委的指示下，市委工业部组织了包括市人民政府、市人民监察委员会、市总工会和我局共同参加的检查组，深入郑州厂检查。现在情况已经弄清楚，郑州市委纪律检查委员会和市人民监察委员会研究了这个问题后，已分别作出处理决定，除了责成郑州厂负责动员拉来的工人返回新秦厂并彻底检查纠正类似情况外，该厂厂长窦秀岩、副厂长张治平（都是党员）已受到党内当众警告、行政记大过的处分；车间主任张呈祥受行政警告处分。窦秀岩、张治平两人也都作了书面检讨。现在郑州厂挖雇来的八个工人已动员回去五个，有三个工人愿意辞退而不回西北。这个问题，现在已处理完毕。”
    铁道部第三勘察设计总队第一分队来信，对该队招收在校学生参加工作的问题作了答复。来信说：
    “即墨县三区章加埠完全小学学生周乃芝等参加工作，并非我队干部去动员的。他从我队一个临时工处打听了我队的情况，先后四次前来要求参加工作。第四次他和同学陈方美一起拿了章加埠乡人民政府的介绍信要求来我队做临时工，接着岚西头乡人民政府又介绍宋宗孟来我队当临时工；当时我队就把他们录用了。事后我们听到陈、宋二人是学生、他们的家长不同意他们参加工作，就把他们劝说回家了。周乃芝的家长没有反对，我们就去信征求区政府意见并向总队请示处理办法。五月七日，我们根据总队指示也动员周乃芝回家了。我们录用这三个人时，见到他们有乡政府的介绍信就没有详细考察他们是不是在校学生，以致影响其他学生的情绪；而在处理这个问题后，也没有及时将结果告诉当地人民政府。这些缺点，我们决心在今后工作中加以纠正。”
