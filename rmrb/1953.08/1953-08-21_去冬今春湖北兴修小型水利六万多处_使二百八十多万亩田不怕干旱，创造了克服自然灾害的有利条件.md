Hubei Province achieved great success in disaster areas last winter and spring by providing work relief and constructing agricultural water conservancy projects. The province completed a total of 68,457 small-scale water conservancy projects (ponds, weirs, small reservoirs), 339 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects (large and medium-sized valley reservoirs, river dams). A total of 39,018,000 workdays were used, with 69,464,500 cubic meters of earthwork and 128,813 cubic meters of stonework. Relief funds of over 178 billion yuan were used, benefiting a total of more than 2.8 million mu of farmland (excluding projects built by the masses themselves).

Most of the area north of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province is hilly, with a lack of water sources. In addition, water conservancy projects fell into disrepair during the Kuomintang rule, and farmers have suffered from drought disasters year after year. Last summer, there was a prolonged drought with no rain, and some areas of the province suffered varying degrees of drought. After September last year, the Central People's Government allocated 180 billion yuan in relief funds in succession, and stipulated that the funds must be used for the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects in disaster areas, providing work relief. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government also determined that production for disaster relief, work relief, and the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects in disaster areas were the central tasks that override all others. From October last year to January this year, the Hubei Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau sent ten engineering teams to disaster areas to complete preliminary survey and measurement work, formulate plans for large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects, and determine that small-scale agricultural water conservancy projects such as ponds and weirs should be done first, followed by large and medium-sized projects such as valley reservoirs and river dams. Under the unified leadership of local party committees and the active participation of the broad masses, large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects commenced in November last year and February this year, and were all victoriously completed by May this year.

At the beginning of the project, all localities vigorously publicized the people's government's policy of work relief, production for disaster relief, and construction of agricultural water conservancy projects, and strengthened political education work among the masses. At that time, many people still had the incorrect understanding that "the government builds ponds, and the masses help." After propaganda and mobilization, mobilizing the masses to carefully calculate accounts, recounting the suffering of disasters, and comparing the past with the present through political education, the masses all understood that the people's government's work relief and water conservancy construction were all for the benefit of the people, and actively participated in various projects.

From the beginning, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government emphasized ensuring project quality and insisted on doing a good job of survey and design before starting construction. Technical personnel were appropriately assigned to all major project sites. Thanks to the attention of the leadership and the efforts of the broad masses of cadres and people, the quality of all projects was basically very good, with 75 percent of the projects fully meeting the standard quality.

In order to overcome the difficulties of lack of experience and technical personnel, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government initially put forward the principle of combining technology with the masses, requiring everyone to learn from the masses, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and learn from the experience and lessons in their work. In terms of small-scale water conservancy, at the beginning of the project, short and simple technical training courses were held in various places, and the method of taking on apprentices was adopted to absorb cadres from neighboring districts and townships to participate in on-site work and conduct on-site learning. This method solved many problems. In terms of large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, in order to solve the difficulties of technology and hydrological data, the method of technical personnel, administrative cadres, and experienced local farmers jointly studying and learning from each other was adopted, overcoming the phenomenon that technical cadres did not rely on the masses and ran around the mountains with their instruments without finding good sites. In order to exchange and summarize technical experience, the Hubei Provincial People's Government convened a meeting of technical personnel when large and medium-sized water conservancy projects were about to be fully launched, specifically summarizing experience and criticizing the bourgeois viewpoints of some technical personnel who did not pay attention to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and from the masses, which played a great role in the smooth development of water conservancy projects.

This project also improved cadres, accumulated experience, and created favorable conditions for large-scale water conservancy construction in the future. After ten months of water conservancy work training, leading cadres and general cadres went from not understanding to understanding, from not being able to do it to being able to do it. Most technical cadres not only learned a set of experience from survey and measurement to construction of the entire project, but also had a systematic understanding and practical experience of important projects such as spillways, earth dam sections, foundations, and culverts. All technicians have also improved their technical level. The broad masses of rural cadres and people have also received the most practical and profound water conservancy project education. Many rural cadres have changed from being completely ignorant of water conservancy to not only being able to organize the masses and lead the masses in building water conservancy, but also understanding some technology.

### 去冬今春湖北兴修小型水利六万多处  使二百八十多万亩田不怕干旱，创造了克服自然灾害的有利条件

    去冬今春湖北兴修小型水利六万多处
    使二百八十多万亩田不怕干旱，创造了克服自然灾害的有利条件
    湖北省去冬今春在灾区以工代赈、兴修农田水利，工作收到巨大成绩。全省共完成了小型水利工程（塘、堰、小型水库）六万八千四百五十七处，大、中型水利工程（大、中型的山谷水库、拦河坝）三百三十九处，共用人工三千九百零一万八千个工作日，用土方六千九百四十六万四千五百公方，石方十二万八千八百十三公方，用赈款一千七百八十余亿元，总共受益田亩二百八十多万亩（群众自办工程未计在内）。
    湖北省长江以北的地区大部是丘陵地带，水源缺乏，加上在国民党统治时期水利失修，历年来农民不断遭受旱灾的袭击。去年夏季久旱不雨，全省有一部分地区遭受程度不同的旱灾。去年九月以后，中央人民政府先后拨来一千八百亿元赈款，并指定该款一定要用于兴修灾区农田水利工程，以工代赈。中共湖北省委和省人民政府当时也确定在灾区以生产救灾、以工代赈、兴修农田水利工程为压倒一切的中心工作任务。自去年十月到今年一月，湖北省水利局派出了十个工程队到灾区完成了普遍勘察测量的准备工作，制订了大、中、小型水利工程计划，并确定先做小型的农田水利如塘、堰等工程，后做大、中型的如山谷水库，拦河坝等工程。在各地党委统一领导，广大群众积极参加下，大、中、小型水利工程均在去年十一月份和今年二月份开工，到今年五月份已全部胜利完工。
    在工程开始时，各地都大力宣传了人民政府的以工代赈、生产救灾、兴修农田水利的政策，对群众加强政治教育工作。当时，不少群众还存在着：“政府修塘、群众帮忙”的不正确认识。经过宣传动员，发动群众算细账，诉灾情苦，回忆过去比比现在的政治教育，群众都明确了人民政府以工代赈、兴修水利都是为了人民的利益，就踊跃参加了各项工程。
    中共湖北省委和省人民政府一开始就强调要保证工程质量，坚持先做好勘察设计然后开工。在各主要工程工地上，都适当地分配了技术人员。由于领导重视和广大干部、群众的努力，所有工程质量基本上都很好，有百分之七十五的工程，完全合乎标准质量。
    为了克服无经验和技术人员缺少的困难，一开始中共湖北省委和省人民政府即提出了技术与群众相结合的方针，要求大家向群众学习，向苏联先进经验学习，向工作中的经验教训学习。在小型水利方面，当工程一开始，各地都举办了短期简单的技术训练班，并采取了带徒弟的办法吸收工地邻区邻乡的干部参加工地工作，进行实地学习，这个办法解决了很多问题。在大、中型水利工程方面，为了解决技术和水文资料等困难问题，采取了技术人员、行政干部和当地有经验的老农共同研究、互相学习的办法，克服了技术干部不依靠群众，自己背着仪器满山跑找不到好场子的现象。为交流和总结技术方面的经验，在大、中型水利工程将全面展开时，湖北省人民政府曾召开了技术人员会议，专门总结了经验，批判了某些技术人员不注意向苏联先进经验学习和向群众学习的资产阶级观点，这对水利工程的顺利开展，起了很大作用。
    这次工程也提高了干部，积累了经验，给今后的大规模水利建设创造了有利条件。经过了十个月的水利工作锻炼，领导干部和一般干部从不懂到懂，从不会到会。大多数技术干部不仅学得了整个工程从勘查测量一直到施工的一套经验，而且对溢洪道、土坝断面、基础、剅管等重要工程，有了系统的认识和实际经验。所有的技工也都提高了技术水平。广大的农村干部和群众也受到最实际最深刻的水利工程教育。许多农村干部对水利由一窍不通变为不仅会组织群众领导群众兴修水利，而且也懂得了一些技术。（本报中南记者站）
