The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province was officially established on July 24th. This is an autonomous region for ethnic minorities equivalent to a special district. The People's Government of the Autonomous Region is temporarily located in Mangshi, Luxi County.

The Autonomous Region is located in the southwestern border of the motherland, west of the Nujiang River in Yunnan, south of 25 degrees north latitude. It currently governs six counties: Luxi, Ruili, Longchuan, Yingjiang, Lianshan, and Lianghe, as well as Zhanxi District of Tengchong. It covers an area of approximately 30,000 square kilometers, bordering Longling County to the east, Tengchong County to the north, and Myanmar to the west and south. The total population of the region is approximately 400,000, comprising nine ethnic groups. Among them, the Dai people number over 175,000, and the Jingpo people number over 97,000, accounting for 68 percent of the total population. The Han population is approximately 100,000, accounting for 25 percent of the total population. Other ethnic groups have smaller populations, accounting for 7 percent of the total population. Within the Autonomous Region, there are continuous branches of the Gaoligong Mountains. Between the mountain ranges flow the Mangshi River, Longchuan River, Nanwan River, Daying River, and Binlang River. On both sides of the rivers, there are more than ten wide and fertile plains. The Mangshi Plain, Longchuan Plain, and Yingjiang Plain are all over a hundred li long. Most of the Dai people live in the plains. Surrounded by evergreen bamboo, are the villages of the Dai people. The climate here is relatively hot, and the rainfall is abundant, making it ideal for rice production. The glutinous indica rice of the Zhezhang Plain is fragrant, and the rice of the Mangshi Plain, with the current farming methods of the Dai people, has an average yield of over 600 catties per mu. In addition, economic crops such as cotton and sugarcane; and tropical fruits such as pineapples, mangoes, and bananas are also abundant. On the mountains between the two rivers, rice and cotton can also be produced, and crops such as corn and tea can also be grown. The mountainous areas also have large quantities of valuable timber and medicinal materials such as teak and cassia trees, as well as rare animal groups such as bears, deer, and serows.

On this beautiful and fertile land, there lies a source of happiness. However, under the long-term rule and exploitation of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, and the invasion of Japanese imperialism, the lives of the people of all ethnic groups were extremely impoverished. After liberation, Chairman Mao's brilliance shone on the border region. The people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region were able to escape the hardships of the past. The People's Government has issued a large number of production loans to help the people of all ethnic groups develop production. Now, the grain output of the Autonomous Region has increased by 20 percent compared with before liberation. The People's Government and the Party committees at all levels have also helped the counties and some districts and townships under the jurisdiction of the Autonomous Region to establish national democratic coalition governments, and one district and twenty-one townships have established Autonomous Region People's Governments. There are already 869 cadres from fraternal ethnic groups participating in political work in the region. The Dai language, which was previously only used to record scriptures in religious texts, has been improved with the help of the People's Government, and preparations are being made to print various books and pictorials. Two new ethnic middle schools have been established in the region, and the number of primary schools has increased to 115, with the number of students increasing by more than nine and a half times compared with the early days of liberation.

The establishment of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region People's Government has given the people of all ethnic groups a bright and happy vision for the future. They are stepping up production, consolidating the militia joint defense, and closely guarding the border of the motherland.

    生活在怒江西岸的肥沃土地上
    ——介绍云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区
    新华社记者  李松青
    云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区，已在七月二十四日正式建立了。这是相当于专区一级的民族自治区。自治区人民政府，暂设在潞西县的芒市。
    自治区位于祖国的西南边疆，在云南怒江以西，北纬二十五度以南的地区。暂辖潞西、瑞丽、陇川、盈江、莲山、梁河等六县，和腾冲的盏西区。面积约三万平方公里，东与龙陵县接壤，北与腾冲县毗连，西部和南部都与缅甸交界。全区人口约四十万，包括九种民族。其中，傣族有一十七万五千多人，景颇族有九万七千多人，共占全区人口的百分之六十八。汉族人口约占十万人，占全区人口的百分之二十五。其他民族人口较少，共占全区人口的百分之七。自治区境内，有连绵不断的高黎贡山的支脉。山脉间，奔流着芒市河、陇川江、南宛河、大盈江、槟榔江等河流。江河两岸，展现了十多个宽广肥沃的平坝。芒市坝、陇川坝、盈江坝等都长达百余里。平坝里多数是傣族人民。在常年绿竹的环绕中，就是一个个傣族人民的村庄。这里气候较热，雨量充足，盛产稻米。遮放坝的糯籼，芳香扑鼻；芒市坝的稻子，以傣族人民现有的耕作方法，每亩平均产量即在六百斤以上。其他，如棉花、甘蔗等经济作物；菠萝、檬果、香蕉等热带水果，出产都非常丰富。在两河之间的山岭上，同样能出产水稻、棉花，还能种玉米、茶叶等作物。山区里还有大量的柚木、桂树等名贵的木材和药材，还有熊、鹿、山羚等稀有的兽群。
    在这块美丽富饶的土地上，蕴藏着幸福的源泉。但在国民党匪帮长期的统治剥削下，和日本帝国主义的侵扰，各族人民的生活，贫困不堪。解放后，毛主席的光辉照到了边疆。自治区的各族人民，才摆脱了过去的苦难岁月。人民政府发放了大量的生产贷款，扶助各族人民发展了生产，现在，自治区的粮食产量，已比解放前增加了两成。人民政府和中共各级党委会，又帮助自治区所辖各县和部分区、乡建立了民族民主联合政府，并有一个区和二十一个乡建立了自治区人民政府。全区参加政权工作的兄弟民族干部，已有八百六十九人。过去一向仅使用在宗教上记录经文的傣族文字，在人民政府的帮助下已得到改进，准备印刷各种书籍和画报。全区新建立了两所民族中学，小学校已发展到一百一十五所，学生人数比解放初期增加了九倍半。
    德宏傣族景颇族自治区人民政府的建立，更使各族人民看到了光明幸福的远景。他们正加紧生产，巩固民兵联防，严密地守卫着祖国的边疆。
