Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 21st. TASS reported from Berlin on the 20th that the German News Agency broadcast a statement by Dr. Johannes Dieckmann, President of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, regarding the Soviet government's note to the French, British, and American governments on the German question.

The statement said: "We hope that the proposals put forward by the Soviet government for resolving the German question will enable West Germans who understand their responsibilities, in their national conscience, to abandon delaying tactics and rise up to advocate the organization of a German provisional government through direct consultations between East and West Germany.

"This is an appeal we have been making for a long time. We know that 98 percent of the people in East and West Germany believe that the Soviet proposals offer a way to peacefully resolve the German question and point out the path for Germany to escape its tragic situation. Now, our common great task is to realize their wishes."

The Soviet government's note continues to be the focus of commentary in Berlin's democratic newspapers. The newspapers unanimously welcomed the recent Soviet peace proposals.

The Central Newspaper of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, "Neues Deutschland," published an editorial entitled "The True Path to Unity and Peace," stating that the proposals put forward in the Soviet government's note could lead to a fair and peaceful resolution of the German question.

The "Berliner Zeitung" pointed out that the issue is not whether Adenauer can accept the Soviet proposals, and said: The majority of the German people demand peace and unity, and they will not abandon the demand for consultations among the four major powers because of any conspiracy.

The Christian Democratic Union's newspaper "Neue Zeit" said in an editorial: "The Soviet government, in its new note, points out the path to resolving the German question."

    民主德国人民议院主席狄克曼发表声明
    拥护苏联关于和平解决德国问题的建议
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十日讯：德意志通讯社播发了德意志民主共和国人民议院主席约翰尼斯·狄克曼博士就苏联政府致法国、英国和美国政府关于德国问题的照会所发表的声明。
    声明说：“我们希望苏联政府为解决德国问题所提出的建议，将使了解他们责任的西德人也本着民族的良知，放弃推托的手段，起而主张通过德国东部和西部之间的直接协商，来组织一个德国临时政府。
    “这是我们提出了好久的呼吁。我们知道，德国东部和西部百分之九十八的人民认为，苏联的建议提出了和平解决德国问题的方法，指出了德国解脱其悲惨境遇的道路。现在，我们共同的伟大的任务就是实现他们的愿望。”
    苏联政府的照会继续成为柏林民主报纸评论的中心。各报一致欢迎苏联最近的和平建议。
    德国统一社会党中央报纸“新德意志报”以“走向统一与和约的真正的道路”为题发表社论说，苏联政府照会中所提出的建议，可以使德国问题和平地获得公正的解决。
    “柏林日报”指出问题不在阿登纳能不能接受苏联的建议，并说：大多数德国人民要求和平和统一，他们不会因任何阴谋而放弃要求四大国协商的主张。
    基督教民主联盟的报纸“新时报”的社论说：“苏联政府在它的新照会中指出了解决德国问题的道路。”
