    Volunteer Army Wounded, Families, and Returning Personnel from Korea
    Celebrate the Signing of the Armistice Agreement, Determined to Continue Helping the Korean People
    After the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement reached various regions of our country, all the wounded and sick Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers who had shed blood on the Korean battlefield and were now back in the country for recuperation, the families of Volunteer Army martyrs and military personnel who had sacrificed their loved ones for the noble cause of peace, as well as members of medical teams, railway employees, and慰问团delegates who had directly participated in the抗美援朝struggle, celebrated with unparalleled excitement the victory they had won at a great cost, and expressed their utmost concern and determination to continue contributing to the peaceful reunification of Korea and to helping the Korean people heal the wounds of war.
    The heroic soldiers who shed blood in the Korean people's war against American aggression deeply cherished this victory of the cause of peace for which they had struggled for many years. Upon hearing the news, all the wounded and sick Volunteer Army soldiers recuperating in a certain hospital in Beijing immediately held a symposium. Cui Jianguo, a first-class combat hero of the Volunteer Army who was awarded the "Military Merit Medal" of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said excitedly in the ward, "It was precisely for the peaceful life of the Chinese and Korean people that martyrs like Huang Jiguang and Qiu Shaoyun, who were in the same unit as me, sacrificed their precious lives." All the recuperating soldiers in the ward unanimously stated: This victory was won by us and the Korean people with blood and flesh, and we must resolutely defend this victory and never allow warmongers to destroy it again. Volunteer Army wounded and sick soldiers recuperating in Hankou, Chongqing, and other places also discussed this great victory with excitement and vigilance. Volunteer Army soldiers recuperating in a certain hospital in Shenyang listened to the news about the Korean armistice on the radio for three consecutive days. They all excitedly said: Our blood was not shed in vain. Our determination to fight for peace has begun to be realized, but to completely ensure peace in Korea and the security of our motherland, we cannot relax our vigilance in the slightest. Volunteer Army soldier Chen Yuzhen said, "I will definitely recuperate well. After my body is strong, I will return to Korea to help the Korean people rebuild their homes."
    Every Volunteer Army martyr's family and military family member in the motherland – these glorious fathers, mothers, and wives – were gratified by the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The entire family of Yang Lian'di, a first-class hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Tianjin, was very excited upon hearing the news. Yang Yuopu, the martyr's father, said, "Lian'di sacrificed for peace, and now that the armistice agreement has been signed, Lian'di's wish has been fulfilled. However, if the United States wants to launch another war, Lian'di has four younger brothers who will definitely inherit his brother's will and fight to the end for peace." Luo Shengjiao, the father of the immortal internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, specially wrote a letter to the families of the Korean People's Army to express his congratulations and condolences, and expressed great concern for their efforts to heal the wounds of war and rebuild their homes. Liu Yuanhu, the father of Lu Min, a first-class combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force, was very happy to see the news. He immediately wrote a letter to Lu Min's unit, congratulating the Volunteer Army soldiers on their great contributions in the抗美援朝struggle, and instructed them to be on guard at all times to prevent the enemy's sabotage actions. He said: Peace is our hope and wish, and we will never allow the victorious fruits of peace to be destroyed by the enemy.
    While celebrating the Korean armistice, the families of the Volunteer Army wrote letters to their relatives in Korea with vigilance, urging them to be on guard against the enemy's sabotage activities at all times and to vigilantly guard their positions until the complete and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. More than 50 Volunteer Army families in Chengdu gathered to celebrate, and many wrote letters to their relatives on the front lines in Korea to express their congratulations. Li Zengshi, a first-class military family model, said in a letter to her son Li Wancai, who won a second-class merit in the Battle of Shangganling: "You have made great contributions to the cause of world peace, but you should continue to prevent the enemy from undermining the armistice agreement. If the enemy crosses the military demarcation line by one step, you must beat them back as you did in the Battle of Shangganling." Li Liangyu, a military family member with two daughters and one son in the Volunteer Army, wrote to her children, saying: "The family does not worry about food or clothing now, so you can rest assured; after the war stops, you should continue to carry forward the spirit of internationalism and help the Korean people rebuild their homes." When Zheng Heying, a Volunteer Army family member in Lanzhou, wrote to her husband, she specially instructed:
    "You must not relax your vigilance against the enemy because of the ceasefire between the two sides. If the United States troops do not withdraw from Korea, you must not come back."
    Many medical team members, railway employees, and慰问团personnel who volunteered to go to Korea and made contributions in the抗美援朝struggle expressed their determination to continue contributing their strength to the common cause of peace of the Chinese and Korean people. Railway employees in Xi'an who volunteered to go to Korea specifically held a symposium. When they talked about the deep friendship between the Korean and Chinese people, they expressed unlimited concern for the Korean people. Railway worker Zhang Zuoli said: "The Korean people treat us like family, often helping us sew cotton socks, cooking for us and taking care of us when we are sick. We must work harder and continue to support the Korean people in rebuilding their homes." Wan Fu'en, the president of Tianjin General Hospital, who volunteered twice to go to Korea to participate in the frontline medical team, said: "The signing of the Korean armistice negotiations is the result of the efforts of the Korean and Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world. After peace is realized in Korea, we must continue to serve the returning Volunteer Army wounded and sick soldiers well, so that they can recover their health as soon as possible and participate in peaceful construction." Chen Zuyin, a well-known thoracic surgery expert in Nanjing who made a great contribution on the front lines in Korea, said: "Although the Korean armistice agreement has been signed, we must not relax. I am a doctor. If some warmongers in the United States and the Li Chengwan bandit gang dare to undermine the armistice, I am determined to go to the front lines again immediately to serve the people who are defending peace." All members of the Fourth Đoàn of the Chinese People's抗美援朝General Association慰问Literary and Art Troupe, who had just returned to Wuhan from the front lines in Korea, proposed to go to Korea again to express their condolences after hearing the news of the signing of the Korean armistice agreement.
    Many farmers who had been to Korea to express their condolences to the Volunteer Army, because they are now living a prosperous life, paid special attention to how the Korean people would heal the wounds of war after the signing of the Korean armistice agreement. Zhang Lirong, the leader of the model mutual aid group in the Sixth District of Chongqing, had participated in the Second Chinese People's慰问Delegation to Korea last year and had personally witnessed the disasters suffered by the Korean people. She said: "Now that Korea has ceased fire, we must work harder to produce and strive to have another good harvest this year to support the Korean people in rebuilding their homes." Yi Jidong, the village chief of Wangmang Village in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, had also been to Korea to express his condolences last year. On the 27th, Yi Jidong convened a symposium of activists and mutual aid group leaders in the village. At the meeting, everyone decided to generally discuss and revise the production plans for August and September in the mutual aid groups, and strive to overfulfill the original plan of producing 680 catties of grain per mu of paddy field, and increase the production of more grain to support the Korean people in rebuilding their homes.

    志愿军伤病员、家属和归国的赴朝人员
    庆祝停战协定签字决心继续帮助朝鲜人民
    朝鲜停战协定签字的消息传到我国的各个地区后，所有在朝鲜战场洒过鲜血现在回国休养的中国人民志愿军伤、病员，和为了崇高的和平事业献出自己亲人的志愿军烈士家属和军人家属以及那些直接参加过抗美援朝斗争的医疗队队员、铁路员工、慰问团团员，都以无比兴奋的心情来庆祝他们用巨大代价所换来的胜利，并以最大关怀的心情表示要为朝鲜的和平统一和帮助朝鲜人民医治战争创伤而继续贡献力量。
    在朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略的战争中流过鲜血的英雄的战士们，十分珍贵这个他们曾为之奋斗多年的和平事业的胜利。正在北京某医院休养的全体志愿军伤、病员听到这一消息后，立即举行了座谈会。荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国“军功章”的志愿军一级战斗英雄崔建国在病房里激动地说：“正是为了中朝人民的和平生活，和我同在一个部队的黄继光、邱少云等烈士献出了他们宝贵的生命。”全病房的休养员都异口同声地表示：胜利是我们和朝鲜人民用血肉换来的，我们要坚决保卫这个胜利，决不允许好战分子再来破坏。在汉口和重庆等地休养的志愿军伤病员，也都纷纷怀着兴奋和警惕的心情，谈论着这一伟大的胜利。正在沈阳某病院休养的志愿军战士在收音机旁连续三天收听了有关朝鲜停战的消息，他们都兴奋地说：我们的血没有白流，我们为和平而斗争的志愿已经开始实现，但要彻底保证朝鲜的和平和祖国的安全，还不能丝毫放松警惕。志愿军战士陈玉振说：“我一定好好休养，待身体强壮起来以后，我还要回到朝鲜，去帮助朝鲜人民重建家园。”
    祖国每一个志愿军烈士家属和军人家属——这些光荣的父亲、母亲和妻子们都为朝鲜停战协定的签字而欣慰。天津市中国人民志愿军一级英雄杨连第烈士的全家听到这一消息后，都非常兴奋。烈士的父亲杨玉璞说：“连第为了和平而牺牲，现在停战协定签字了，连第的愿望达到了，但是，如果美国还要发动战争，连第还有四个弟弟，他们一定能继承他哥哥的意志，为争取和平斗争到底。”不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教烈士的父亲罗迭开特地写了一封信给朝鲜人民军的家属，表示祝贺和慰问，并对他们医治战争创伤和重建家园的努力寄予巨大的关怀。中国人民志愿军空军一级战斗英雄鲁珉的父亲刘元祜看到消息后感到十分高兴，他立即写了一封信给鲁珉所在的部队，祝贺志愿军战士们在抗美援朝斗争中的伟大贡献，并嘱咐他们要随时戒备，防止敌人的破坏行动。他说：和平是我们的希望和意愿，我们绝不允许和平的胜利成果被敌人毁掉。
    志愿军家属们在欢庆朝鲜停战的同时，都怀着警惕的心情写信勉励他们在朝鲜的亲人，要他们时时刻刻提防敌人的破坏活动，警惕地守卫阵地，直到朝鲜问题的完全和平解决为止。成都市志愿军家属五十多人集会庆祝，许多人写信给朝鲜前线的亲人表示祝贺。一等军属模范李曾氏在给他的在上甘岭战役中立了二等功的儿子李万才的信上说：“你们已为世界和平事业立了很大功劳，但是还应该继续防止敌人破坏停战协定，假使敌人跨过军事分界线一步，你就像在上甘岭战役中一样把他们打回去。”有两个女儿和一个儿子参加志愿军的军属李良玉写信给她的儿女们说：“家里现在不愁吃，不愁穿，你们可以放心；战争停了以后，你们还应该继续发扬国际主义精神，帮助朝鲜人民重建家园。”兰州市志愿军家属郑和英给她的丈夫写信时，特别嘱咐说：
    “不能因双方停火而放松对敌人的警惕，要是美国军队不撤出朝鲜，你决不能回来。”
    许多志愿赴朝在抗美援朝斗争中作过贡献的医疗队员、铁路员工以及慰问团的人员们，都表示要为中朝人民共同的和平事业继续贡献自己的力量。西安市志愿赴朝的铁路员工们专门召开了座谈会，他们讲起朝中人民的深厚友谊，都对朝鲜人民寄予无限的关怀。铁路工人张作礼说：“朝鲜人民待我们像亲人，常常帮我们缝棉袜，病了为我们烧饭、照料，我们一定要更加努力工作，继续支援朝鲜人民重建家园。”曾经两次志愿赴朝参加战地医疗队的天津市总医院院长万福恩说：“朝鲜停战谈判的签字，是朝中人民和全世界爱好和平人民努力的结果。朝鲜和平实现后，我们一定还要好好地为回国的志愿军伤、病员服务，使他们早日恢复健康，参加和平建设。”曾经在朝鲜前线立过一次大功的南京市著名胸腔外科专家陈祖荫说：“朝鲜停战协定虽然签订，但我们一定不能松懈，我是一个医生，如果一旦美国一些好战分子和李承晚匪帮胆敢破坏停战，我决心立刻重上前线，去为保卫和平的人们服务。”刚从朝鲜前线返回武汉的中国人民抗美援朝总会赴朝慰问文艺工作团第四团全体团员，听到朝鲜停战协定签字的消息后，纷纷提出再度赴朝慰问的要求。
    许多到过朝鲜慰问过志愿军的农民们，由于他们现在正过着蒸蒸日上的生活，朝鲜停战协定签字以后，他们就特别关心朝鲜人民如何医治战争的创伤。重庆市六区模范互助组组长张莉蓉，曾在去年参加中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团到过朝鲜前线，亲眼看到过朝鲜人民遭受的灾难。她说：“现在朝鲜停战了，我们更要努力生产，争取今年再有一次好收成，来支援朝鲜人民重建家园。”陕西省长安县王蟒村的村长益冀东在去年也曾经到朝鲜慰问，二十七日，益冀东召集该村积极分子和互助组长开座谈会，会上大家决定在互助组里普遍讨论修订八、九月份的生产计划，争取超额完成原订每亩稻田产粮六百八十斤的计划，增产更多的粮食，以支援朝鲜人民重建家园。（新华社）
