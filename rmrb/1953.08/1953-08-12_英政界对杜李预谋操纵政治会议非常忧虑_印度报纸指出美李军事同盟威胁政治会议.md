Xinhua News Agency, August 11th—According to Reuters, British political figures are very concerned about Dulles' agreement that the United States would withdraw from the political conference with Syngman Rhee ninety days after it convenes. Observers in London say that the obligations Dulles has undertaken to Syngman Rhee seem to contradict the assurances that Britain recently received from Dulles. Acting British Foreign Secretary Salisbury said in the House of Lords last week that Dulles had assured him that the United States would consult with its "allies" before taking such significant steps. According to Reuters, there is a feeling in London that the United States' prior agreement to withdraw from the political conference ninety days after it convenes could seriously jeopardize the resolution of Far Eastern issues.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, August 11th—The Indian "National Herald" published an editorial on August 6th commenting on the South Korea-United States mutual security treaty, saying: "Dulles announced that according to the mutual security treaty to be signed with the Seoul government, American troops will remain in South Korea. This is astonishing because the first item on the agenda of the political conference is the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea."

    印度报纸指出美李军事同盟威胁政治会议
    【新华社十一日讯】据路透社报道，英国政界人士对杜勒斯同意李承晚在政治会议举行九十天后美国将与他一起退出会议，表示非常忧虑。伦敦方面观察家说，杜勒斯对李承晚所承担的义务，似乎与英国在不久以前从杜勒斯所获得的保证非常矛盾。因为英国代理外交大臣萨利斯伯利上星期曾在上议院中说，杜勒斯曾向他保证，美国在采取这种重大步骤以前，将先和它的“盟国”磋商。据路透社报道，伦敦方面有一种感觉，觉得美国事先同意在政治会议举行九十天后退出会议，可能严重地危害了远东问题的解决。
    【新华社新德里十一日电】印度“国民先驱报”八月六日发表社论，评论南朝鲜与美国的共同安全条约说：“杜勒斯宣布，依照将要和汉城政府签订的共同安全条约，美国军队将留在南朝鲜。这是令人惊诧的，因为政治会议的第一项议程就是一切外国军队撤离朝鲜问题。”
