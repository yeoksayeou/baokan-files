    Solve the Enrollment Problem of Primary School Graduates Practically and Realistically
    The people of New China, thanks to the gradual improvement of their material lives and the continuous raising of their political consciousness, have increasing needs in terms of culture and education, and the number of students entering schools is increasing year by year. Although middle and primary schools across the country have developed significantly in the past few years, they still cannot meet the needs of the people. There are still a large number of school-age children who cannot attend school, and a large number of primary school graduates who cannot continue their education. This year, the problem of primary school graduates continuing their education is even more serious than in previous years, which has aroused the deep concern of our Party and the People's Government and must be appropriately resolved. The nature of the problem is very clear: this is obviously a difficulty that is hard to avoid on the road to victory and development.
    In the past four years, our Party and the People's Government have been deeply aware of the serious significance of developing the people's education, and have made great efforts in this regard. There are now more than 55 million primary school students nationwide, more than double the highest number during the Kuomintang rule in 1946. There are now more than 3 million secondary school students, more than one and a half times the highest number during the Kuomintang rule in 1946. Due to the implementation of the policy of opening schools to workers and peasants, the composition of students has also undergone fundamental changes. Children of workers and peasants account for more than 80 percent of the total number of primary school students and more than 60 percent of the total number of secondary school students. There is no doubt that, along with the steady development of planned national economic construction, China's people's cultural and educational undertakings will continue to develop and improve, gradually achieving the goal of maximizing the satisfaction of the people's needs. The Soviet Union is our living example. But at present, due to the limitations of objective and subjective conditions, it is impossible to fully meet the needs of the people all at once, which is easy to understand.
    The reason why we cannot currently run cultural and educational undertakings on a larger scale to meet all the needs of the people in this area is primarily because we must use our main manpower, material resources, and financial resources for economic construction. The development and consolidation of China's economic construction, with industrial construction as the focus, is not only a guarantee for strengthening and consolidating national defense, ensuring peace, and continuously improving the people's material living standards, but also a prerequisite for developing the people's cultural and educational undertakings on a larger scale. At the beginning of its founding, the Soviet Union had to "save everywhere, even on schools" (Lenin) in order to "save and restore heavy industry." It was not until 1938, due to the enormous development of economic construction, that the Soviet Union further implemented seven-year compulsory education. According to the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, "By the end of the Five-Year Plan, compulsory secondary education (ten-year education) will be completely transformed from seven-year education in the capitals of all republics, cities directly under the jurisdiction of the republic, central cities of provinces and border regions, and large industrial centers. Prepare conditions for the complete implementation of universal secondary education (ten-year education) in other cities and rural areas during the next Five-Year Plan." It is clear that, in China's current actual situation, and even for a considerable period of time to come, we will not be able to fully meet the people's growing demands in terms of culture and education.
    The second reason why we cannot currently develop cultural and educational undertakings on a larger scale lies in the weakness of the foundation of China's cultural and educational undertakings themselves. The "cultural and educational legacy" left to us by old China was a mess. We are gradually carrying out transformation work on the basis of this mess, gradually restoring and developing cultural and educational undertakings. We have achieved many results in uniting, transforming, and training teachers and building school buildings, and we will continue to achieve greater results, but we must not reach the ideal goal all at once and fully meet the needs of the people.
    The reason why we want to clarify the nature of the problem and the reasons for its occurrence is to enable everyone to achieve a unified and correct understanding, so as to mobilize and organize forces from all sides, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, to solve the difficulties before us in a timely and as possible manner with a high degree of positive spirit and realistic methods. As long as there is a possibility, we should more fully meet the people's growing demands in education.
    According to the current actual situation, what methods should we take? First, we should try to increase classes in existing schools, or adjust existing classes, to enroll as many students as possible. All schools that can increase classes and enroll more students, if the enrollment examination results have been released, should promptly consider the method of re-enrolling students, or select a considerable number of candidates from those not admitted last time based on certain score standards, and should give appropriate consideration to their academic performance in the original school, or re-examine them once. Second, schools that have not yet implemented the two-part system should be changed to the two-part system as much as possible, so that they can enroll twice as many students. Some two-part schools have already gained a lot of experience in teaching organization and teaching methods, and this experience should be introduced in a timely manner for other schools to refer to. Third, select some junior high schools and higher primary schools with conditions to open night schools to teach the main courses of junior high school or higher primary school. In this regard, some schools have also gained some experience and should be promoted. Fourth, with the support of the local masses, some public houses (such as temples and guilds) can be used, or private houses can be rented or purchased to add new schools. Fifth, the local education authorities and Party committees should, according to actual conditions, assist industrial, mining enterprises, and organizations in establishing some middle and primary schools to enroll the children of workers and staff members of their units or systems. All units or systems that have the conditions to run schools should start active preparations even if they do not have time to do so this semester in order to solve the difficulties for the next semester. Sixth, we should encourage the general public or industrialists and businessmen to invest privately in establishing primary schools, and we should also allow private tutoring schools to be opened. The original private tutoring schools that have certain conditions in terms of teachers and school buildings can be helped to be converted into middle or primary schools according to the actual situation.
    In order to implement the above-mentioned methods in a timely and effective manner, the local education authorities, school education workers, Party committees, and other relevant organizations must be actively responsible and cooperate fully. The key issue is teachers. Various methods should be used to focus on solving the difficulty of insufficient teachers after junior high schools enroll more students. Some government cadres can be transferred, unemployed intellectuals can be recruited, and surplus literacy teachers and trainees from short-term teacher training classes can also be selected, but appropriate attention must be paid to quality, and unqualified personnel must not be pulled in to fill the numbers. In addition, we can also consider selecting some primary school teachers to be junior high school teachers, but not too many should be transferred to avoid seriously affecting the quantity and quality of primary school teachers.
    Of course, while trying to enroll as many primary school graduates as possible, appropriate attention must be paid to the level of students, and the admission standards should not be lowered too much. At the same time, the above-mentioned methods are actually difficult to solve the problem of enrollment for all candidates who meet the admission standards. In order to help primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies to continue learning, the following methods can also be adopted: First, students who perform too poorly and cannot continue their studies should, under the principle of voluntariness, be allowed to return to their original schools to continue learning as much as possible; those who are sixteen years old can be introduced to factories as apprentice workers if they are willing and meet the requirements of the factories; students who are not admitted with not-too-poor grades can be considered to be accommodated in the attached remedial night schools of various middle schools, allowing them to study for one year and then take the first-year junior high school exam or join the class; Second, radio stations can consider adding lectures to teach the main courses of junior high school to help higher primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies to study on their own; Third, China Youth Daily and China Young Pioneers should introduce as much self-study materials and experience as possible to help young children who cannot continue their studies to study on their own. In addition, we can also consider formulating control figures according to the needs of national economic construction, and let industrial and mining enterprises run technical schools to specifically recruit higher primary school graduates who are at least fourteen years old, and after two years of study, go to factories as technicians. This not only solves the problem of the future of higher primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies, but also trains a large number of technicians for national economic construction and increases the source of supplementary cadres.
    We believe that under the leadership of our Party and the People's Government, with the efforts of the vast number of education workers and the full cooperation of the students' parents, and with the cooperation of other forces, it may be possible to come up with more ways to overcome the current and future difficulties of primary school graduates not being able to fully continue their studies. We are never afraid of difficulties, because our difficulties are all difficulties on the road to victory and development. The revolutionary cause of our Party and people has developed and grown stronger in the process of constantly fighting difficulties. What is important is to foresee difficulties soberly, understand the nature of difficulties correctly, face difficulties bravely, and solve difficulties gradually, steadfastly, and realistically. This is the key to our ability to constantly overcome difficulties.

    实事求是地解决小学毕业生升学问题
    新中国的人民，由于物质生活的逐步改善和政治觉悟的不断提高，在文化教育方面的需要也日益增长，入学的人数逐年激增。尽管几年来全国中、小学有了很大的发展，但仍不能满足人民的需要，仍有大量学龄儿童不能入学，大量小学毕业生不能升学，而今年的小学毕业生升学问题比往年更为严重，引起了我们的党和人民政府的深切关怀，必须适当地加以解决。问题的性质非常清楚，这显然是胜利和发展途中很难避免的困难。
    在过去的四年中，我们的党和人民政府深知发展人民教育事业的严重意义，在这方面作了极大的努力。全国现有小学生五千五百余万人，跟一九四六年国民党统治时期最高数相比，增加到两倍多。现有中等学校学生三百余万人，跟一九四六年国民党统治时期最高数相比，增加到一倍半以上。由于执行了学校向工农开门的方针，学生的成份也发生了根本的变化，工农子女在小学生总数中占百分之八十以上，在中等学校学生总数中占百分之六十以上。毫无疑问，跟着有计划的国家经济建设的稳步发展，我国的人民文教事业也将不断地发展和提高，逐步达到最大限度地满足人民需要的目标。苏联便是我们的活榜样。但在目前，由于主客观条件的限制，不可能一下子完全满足人民的需要，这是容易理解的。
    我们目前所以不能更大规模地举办文教事业，以满足人民在这方面的全部需要，首先是因为我们要把主要人力、物力和财力用在经济建设事业上。以工业建设为重点的我国经济建设事业的发展和巩固，不但是增强与巩固国防、确保和平、不断提高人民的物质生活水平的保证，同时也是更大规模地发展人民文教事业的先决条件。苏联在建国之初，为了“拯救和恢复重工业”，不得不“处处节省，甚至在学校上节省”（列宁）。直到一九三八年，由于经济建设的巨大发展，苏联才进一步实施七年制义务教育。根据苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的决议，“到五年计划结束时，在各共和国首都、共和国直辖市、省和边区的中心城市以及大工业中心，把七年制教育完全改为普及中等教育（十年制教育）。为下一个五年计划期间在其他城市和农村中完全实行普及中等教育（十年制教育）准备条件。”    显然的，在我国目前的实际情况下，甚至在今后相当长的时期内，我们还不可能完全满足人民在文化教育方面日益增长的要求。
    我们目前所以不能更大规模地发展文教事业的第二个原因，在于我国文教事业本身基础的薄弱。旧中国留给我们的“文教遗产”是一个烂摊子，我们是在这个烂摊子的基础上逐步进行改造工作，逐步恢复和发展文教事业的。我们在团结、改造和培养师资以及修建校舍等方面，取得了不少的成果，而且还要不断取得更大的成果，但决不能一下子达到理想的目标，完全满足人民的要求。
    我们所以要讲清楚问题的性质及其发生的原因，是因为要大家取得一致的正确的认识，以便发动和组织各方面的力量，在党和人民政府的领导下，用高度的积极精神和实事求是的办法，及时地、尽可能地解决摆在我们面前的困难。只要有一点可能，我们就应该更多地满足人民在教育方面的日益增长的要求。
    根据当前的实际情况，我们应该采取什么办法呢？第一，应就原有学校设法增班，或调整原有班级，尽可能地多招些学生。凡是可以增班、可以多招些学生的学校，招生考试如已放榜，应该及时地考虑再次招生的办法，或根据一定的分数标准，在上次没有录取的考生中选择相当的名额，并应适当照顾他们在原校的学习成绩，或再考试一次。第二，应该尽可能地使尚未办二部制的学校改为二部制，这样便可以多收一倍的学生。有些二部制学校已经在教学组织和教学方法等方面取得了不少经验，应该把这些经验及时地介绍出来，供其他学校参考。第三，选择部分有条件的初中和高小，开办夜校，教授初中或高小的主要课程。在这一方面，有些学校也取得了一定的经验，应该加以推广。第四，在当地群众的赞助下，可以利用某些公共房屋（如庙宇、会馆），或设法租用或购买民房，增设新的学校。第五，各地教育主管部门和党委应该根据实际条件，协助工矿企业和机关团体创办一些中、小学校，招收本单位或本系统的工人和工作人员的子女。凡是有条件办学校的单位或系统，即使本学期来不及办，也应开始积极筹备，为下学期解决困难。第六，应该鼓励一般群众或工商业家私人出资设立小学，也应该允许私人开办补习学校。在师资、校舍等方面有一定条件的原有私立补习学校，可以根据实际情况，帮助他们改为中学或小学。
    为了及时地、有效地实行上述办法，各地教育主管部门、学校教育工作人员、党委以及其他有关机关团体，必须积极负责，通力合作。关键问题在于师资，应该用各种办法有重点地解决初中多收学生后师资不足的困难。可以抽调一些机关干部，可以招收失业知识分子，也可以选拔多余的扫除文盲教师和短期师资训练班的学员，但必须适当注意质量，不能乱拉不称职的人员滥竽充数。此外还可以考虑选拔一些小学教师当初中教师，但不能过多抽调，以免小学教师的数量和质量受到严重的影响。
    当然，在尽量多招收小学毕业生的时候，必须适当注意学生的程度，不应过分降低录取标准。同时，上述的几项办法事实上也很难解决全部合乎录取标准的考生的升学问题。为了帮助不能升学的小学毕业生继续学习，还可以采取下列的办法：一、对成绩过差，不能升学的学生，应在自愿原则下，尽可能允许他们回到原校继续学习；年龄满十六岁的，可在本人愿意并合乎工厂要求的条件下介绍到工厂当练习工；对成绩不太差的未录取的学生，可以考虑在各中学附设补习夜校，予以收容，让他们学习一年之后再考初中一年级或插班；二、广播电台可以考虑增设讲座，讲授初中主要课程，帮助不能升学的高小毕业生自习；三、中国青年报和中国少年报应该尽可能多介绍自学的材料和经验，帮助不能升学的少年儿童自学。此外，还可以考虑根据国家经济建设的需要，拟定控制数字，由各工矿企业办技工学校，专门招收年满十四岁的高小毕业生，学习二年后到工厂作技术工人。这样做，不但可以解决今后不能升学的高小毕业生的出路问题，而且为国家经济建设培养了大批技术工人，也增加了补充干部的来源。
    我们相信，在我们的党和人民政府的领导下，在广大的教育工作人员的努力和学生的家长们的充分合作下，在其他各方面力量的配合下，还可能想出更多的办法来克服当前和今后小学毕业生不能充分升学的困难。我们从来不怕困难，因为我们的困难都是胜利和发展途中的困难。我们的党和人民革命事业，都是在不断跟困难作斗争的过程中发展壮大起来的。重要的是要清醒地预见困难，正确地认识困难的性质，勇敢地面对困难，坚定地、实事求是地逐步解决困难。这便是我们能够不断战胜困难的关键所在。
