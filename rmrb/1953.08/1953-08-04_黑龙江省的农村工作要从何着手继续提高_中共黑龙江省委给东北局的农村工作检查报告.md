Editor's Note: This is a report made by the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. This report systematically examines many major issues, shortcomings, and errors in Heilongjiang Province's rural work and agricultural production policies, and analyzes their ideological roots in depth. These problems, shortcomings, and errors also exist in other provinces. Leading organs and rural work departments in various localities can refer to this report to further examine various problems in rural work, analyze the reasons, and determine improvement measures.

The Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, armed with the central government's instructions and documents on rural work, has conducted a relatively systematic inspection of the problems discovered during three deep dives into rural areas since this spring.

Heilongjiang Province has achieved certain successes in this year's spring plowing production. We have grasped several key issues in spring plowing production: 1. Conducted policy re-education to eliminate farmers' ideological concerns and enhance their enthusiasm for expanding production. 2. Conscientiously implemented the mutual benefit policy in some mutual aid groups; established several agricultural production cooperatives under relatively normal circumstances. 3. Focusing on promoting the Zhaoyuan experience has achieved certain results. This year's spring plowing production generally started earlier, progressed faster, and the quality of field cultivation was better, laying a good foundation for this year's agricultural production increase. However, this year's agricultural production tasks in our province and the requirements for future rural work are still very arduous; at the same time, there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work. If these shortcomings and errors are not well exposed and corrected, they will seriously affect the completion of this year's agricultural production and other rural work tasks.

(1) When formulating the 1953 and future five-year agricultural production plans and other major rural work plans, insufficient research was conducted on the actual situation in the province. These plans have the problem of being too high and too large. We once demanded that grain production increase by 100% within five years based on the planned output in 1952; required agricultural production cooperatives to fully promote the Zhaoyuan experience this year, improve farming methods, and require their unit area output to be 20% to 30% higher than the local good mutual aid groups, and to create high yields of 15 to 20 shi of raw grain per hectare on 20% of the land, and to have new record plots of 0.5 to 1 hectare of each of the five major crops with yields of more than 20 shi per hectare. It now seems that these unified requirements for new and old cooperatives are too high. In terms of expanding cultivated land area, the requirement to reach 5 million hectares by 1957 is also too much. In terms of mutual aid and cooperation, we once demanded that 80% of farmers participate in agricultural production cooperatives and collective farms within five years; calculated at an average of 25 households per cooperative, it would be necessary to develop 34,268 cooperatives; collective farms would be established at 100 per collective farm, requiring 100 collective farms. These are all unrealistic. In 1953, it was required to build 1,200 new cooperatives, but only 717 were actually built. The consolidation work of the existing two collective farms is already very difficult, let alone the development of new collective farms. In terms of technical promotion: at the beginning, the Zhaoyuan experience was required to be "comprehensively promoted" and "vigorously promoted," confusing publicity with actual requirements. When cadres went to the countryside, farmers raised objections to this, and farmers also raised objections at the provincial labor model representative meeting, but we did not pay attention to it. This is a profound lesson. In terms of credit: we once required all supply and marketing cooperatives to establish credit departments within five years, and two-thirds of the supply and marketing cooperatives should establish credit departments in 1953. Therefore, some supply and marketing cooperatives forced the masses to deposit money, even to deposit cattle and horses, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses and increased their concerns. Because our leadership had these excessively high requirements, it directly affected the excessively high demands and overly large plans of the counties and districts. For example, Hailun County proposed to increase grain output by 114% within five years, and required this year's output to be 40% higher than in 1952; the Fourteenth District of the county required an average grain output of 15 shi per hectare. These are far from reality.

(2) There were also blind and rash emotions in grasping certain policies of mutual aid and cooperation and in guiding practical work. In 1952, there was insufficient prior control over many spontaneously formed agricultural production cooperatives, and after they were discovered, we failed to help them reorganize immediately, and it was delayed until winter before the problem was basically resolved. The phenomena of excessive accumulation of public property in agricultural production cooperatives, excessively large scales, excessive debt, unclear business direction, and excessive emphasis on collective life and unified planned consumption were discovered as early as June 1952, but were not clearly raised for correction and prevention at the Agricultural Production Cooperative Representative Meeting in August of the same year, and were not resolutely corrected until January of this year. Although we had pointed out the phenomenon of blind and excessive assistance from state banks and supply and marketing cooperatives to a few cooperatives and groups long ago, we did not specifically organize relevant departments to control it in time, so that it still formed a general bias. The Suihua County Party Committee proposed to basically establish cooperatives universally in Minji Village in 1953, which was approved by us and published in the Party journal; after discovering it was too hasty, we then issued a notice to stop it. The direction of livestock cooperativeization is correct, but it only mentioned actively and steadily developing it, and did not clearly stipulate the steps of conducting individual trials first, and the control was not strict, and the phenomenon of being eager for quick results also occurred below. The two collective farms that we directly led to establish had the villagers eating together from the beginning, which had a considerable impact on other agricultural production cooperatives. Excessive loans and excessively large scales of the two farms are also closely related to the blind and rash emotions of our leadership.

(3) There are also serious blind and rash advancement biases in technical promotion and technical reform. In terms of farm implement promotion, quantity is emphasized over quality, and the role of new-style horse-drawn farm implements has not been fully utilized, resulting in serious losses and waste; emphasizing centralized distribution is not compatible with the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation. Six hundred and ninety-eight sets of horse-drawn farm implements were distributed to mutual aid groups, accounting for 57% of all new-style farm implements distributed; but mutual aid groups have little land and lack horsepower, and the boundaries have not been opened, so it is difficult to play the role of new-style farm implements. Each set of new-style farm implements can cultivate 80 hectares of land; now the total area of land cultivated by new-style farm implements in the province is 24,000 hectares, with an average of only 20 hectares cultivated per set. Experiments in 1952 proved that each hectare of land can increase production by about 2 shi by using new-style farm implements compared to using old farm implements. Each set cultivates 20 hectares, which can increase production by 40 shi of grain, equivalent to 6 million yuan (150,000 yuan per shi of sorghum). The cost of each set of new-style farm implements is 50 million yuan, which must be paid off in three years according to the ratio of 2, 3, and 5; plus 9% bank interest, the first year requires repayment of 15.4 million yuan (equivalent to more than 102 shi of grain), the second year requires payment of 19.32 million yuan (equivalent to more than 128 shi of grain), and the third year requires payment of 27.7 million yuan (equivalent to more than 184 shi of grain), plus repair costs, farmers have to lose 50 to 60 shi of grain each year.

In terms of old farm implement improvement, the mistakes of the past were repeated. The direction is not clear, not cautious, and there is a problem of rashly advocating. Many counties have unified manufacturing of old farm implements from top to bottom, with less mobilization of the masses to manufacture them themselves; as a result, they are crudely manufactured, with inconsistent specifications, poor quality, impracticality, and high prices, resulting in a large backlog. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Union alone has a backlog of more than 23,500 pieces of cement rollers, stubble cutters, improved harrows, gourd planters, and small rakes. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties have also accumulated a lot, such as Suihua, which has accumulated 500 unusable improved harrows, and Nehe, which has accumulated 4,000 plowshares and more than 1,000 iron plows.

In terms of the promotion of manure fertilizer, chemical fertilizer, and pesticides, instead of taking materials locally and starting from the farmers' personal experience, there was blind procurement and sales, regardless of cost, resulting in a large backlog. The scope of manure procurement covered Inner Mongolia, Dalian, Yingkou, Shenyang, and Harbin, with a total purchase of 196,460 tons, but only 11,770 tons were sold. The province purchased a total of 1,300 tons of ammonium sulfate, but only the five counties of Keshan, Yian, Kedong, Fuyu, and Baiquan accumulated 735 tons. When promoting it, it was not based on the needs of the soil and crops. The northern black soil is not short of nitrogen fertilizer, but ammonium sulfate was still promoted. Baiquan has 50,000 hectares of soybeans, and 60,000 bags of rhizobium were promoted, exceeding the demand (note: one bag of rhizobium is enough for more than one hectare of land). It is estimated that the province has accumulated about 83,000 jin of Ceresan, and forced allocation has occurred in many places. Some farmers in Hainan District of Hailun were forced to buy Ceresan and then bury it in a pit; some places in Keshan County promoted Ceresan to elderly villagers who did not grow wheat, which had a very bad impact. The masses satirized: "Three li three away (Ceresan), six li six back (666 powder), and finally a tight root (rhizobium)."

In terms of cultivation technology reform, instead of typical experiments and gradual promotion, there was a phenomenon of commandism. For example, last fall, the Provincial Government Agriculture Department and the Provincial Party Committee Rural Work Department repeatedly urged all counties to seize the autumn plowing, which was necessary; but the urging was too tight and the numerical requirements were too high, resulting in commandism in various counties and districts; even when the ground was already frozen, telegrams were sent to urge. Some farmers in Hailun were forced to plow the ground at night with lanterns. Because the leadership required 30% to 40% of the cultivated land of agricultural production cooperatives to be plowed, some places even mobilized the manpower of mutual aid groups to plow the ground for cooperatives. The county committee of Nehe still wanted the masses to plow the ground when the soil was frozen two inches deep. One mutual aid group broke eight plowshares and three tiller bars while plowing, and was praised by the county committee. The masses reflected: "The plow beam is bent, the old mare is exhausted, and the wet soil is plowed dry." Because the masses were not willing, the quality of plowing was poor in many places, and it was not harrowed and rolled in time, so it could not retain moisture, and the farmers were very dissatisfied.

There was also blind expansion in livestock breeding and variety improvement. The province has established 87 livestock guidance stations and 38 guidance offices (42 artificial insemination stations are outside), with a total of 470 cadres. The Personnel Department did not approve it, and the funds were spent from the Agriculture Department's operating expenses. There have been some achievements in artificial insemination work in recent years, but there are also many problems. For example, the livestock in the Sartu Livestock Experimental Farm are: more feeding, less insemination, more abortions, fewer foals, more deaths, and fewer living. In the fall of 1952, the Provincial Department of Agriculture used 2 billion yuan from the national agricultural loan to buy back 2,000 cows in Inner Mongolia, emphasizing "introducing breeds" and lending them to two collective farms and farmers in Anda, Duqi, and San Zhao areas. There was no strict inspection when buying, and some of them brought bovine contagious pleuropneumonia; and the price was higher than that of the province (840,000 yuan per head, more than 200,000 yuan more expensive than local medium-sized cows). As far as is known, more than 400 heads have died in collective farms and other places, and the state compensates 200,000 yuan for each dead head. The masses are dissatisfied with this, calling these cows "a set of long, three feet high, diarrhea, hunchback."

The establishment of technical guidance stations is necessary, and the work has also achieved results; but there is a problem of emphasizing quantity over quality in development. There are currently 201 guidance stations in the province, with a total of 1,034 people. Among them, the technical level of some cadres is too low, and they have made many mistakes in technical guidance. Liu Yaoxian, a cadre of the Ninth District Station in Wangkui, did warm water soaking for the masses, holding a watch and sitting on the kang, and let the old lady burn the fire, resulting in the seeds being cooked. The station's guiding principles and tasks are not clear. There are seven instructions from the higher authorities and four regulations in the province, and the statements are different, causing confusion. The guiding principle proposed by some stations is "Develop the economy and consolidate national defense"; the station chief of Gucheng Station in the Seventh District of Keshan said that their guiding principle and task is to "go deep into the Party and League, grasp ideology, and solve a series of problems."

(4) In terms of the work of state-owned farms, there has been a great improvement in leadership work since last winter, and certain achievements have indeed been made; but there are still high costs, large plans, and a mentality of greed and rash advancement, and the leadership is still not comprehensive enough. The average actual output of farms in the province last year was 2,390 jin of grain, and this year's plan requires an average output of 5,560 jin of grain. According to the statistics of 30 farms, non-direct production personnel account for 23.2% of all personnel. The average cost per hectare of farm land in the province is 1.4 million yuan. According to the statistics of 35 farms, wages account for 53% of the cost. The Jiusan Farm invested 20 billion yuan this year. Cow sheds are built with bricks and tiles; workers' dormitories are built with first-class houses; the repair shop was originally usable, and 3 billion yuan was spent to repair it. There is already enough cultivated land to grow, and 1,200 hectares are still being reclaimed. Many counties have not yet included farm work on the agenda, and their understanding of the great significance of running state-owned farms well is insufficient.

(5) The following shortcomings exist in the work and leadership style of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee: (1) The grasp of the situation is not comprehensive enough, not timely enough, and not accurate enough. The materials are scattered and fragmented, and there is very little centralized research and analysis. When needed, it is grabbed temporarily. There is insufficient regular accumulation and research of materials, which affects the timely guidance of the leadership, so sometimes it forms a "after the fact," lacking foresight. (2) The leadership thought is not comprehensive enough. More attention is paid to mutual aid and cooperation work, and less attention is paid to the work of the Agriculture Department, the Forestry Department, and other related departments; more inspections are made to large counties and fewer to small counties; reports from large counties are also preferred, and reports from small counties are less willing to read. When going down to inspect the work, there are more deductions for problems and less help to counties and districts; more individual exploration of experience and less summarization of mass experience. (3) There is a rash problem in the work style. Insufficient deep thinking and repeated calculation of advantages and disadvantages on major issues, rash decisions, and eagerness for quick results often replace reality with wishes. Simple explanations of specific tasks are more, ideological brewing and repeated research are less; general requirements are more for deploying work, and less consideration is given to regional differences. Sometimes mechanical regulations require materials to be "neat," and writing them is always the same old way. As a result, the situation is lengthy, the achievements and methods are abstract, the problems are not specific, and the experience is dry.

The impact of these shortcomings and errors is great: (1) Because our leadership's plans are large, demands are high, there are certain rash emotions, and there are problems of subjectivism and bureaucracy, this has fueled the rash advancement of working comrades at lower levels and the commandism of grass-roots cadres. (2) Due to rash advancement, some places have infringed on farmers' ownership rights, damaged the interests of middle peasants, and harmed the production enthusiasm of some farmers. (3) Many good things have been turned into bad things, wasting manpower and money, accumulating state funds, losing people's property, reducing grain production, and causing great political losses to the Party and the People's Government.

The basic reasons for these problems are: (1) The fragmented, individual small-scale peasant economy is not well understood. Doing rural work without being familiar with the farmers and the rural situation, treating the farmers in the individual economy and the mutual aid and cooperative organizations organized on this basis as collective farmers and collective farms; regarding the consciousness of some activists and advanced farmers as the emotions of all farmers; regarding the future vision as today's realistic plan. This is the main source of high demands, large plans, and blind rash advancement. It is wrong to be satisfied with the status quo of small-scale peasant farming and to let it go unchecked; but in the longer term, any measures and requirements for rural work and agricultural production must start from the status quo of the small-scale peasant economy, from the farmers' personal experience, from protecting the interests of farmers and giving play to their enthusiasm for production, and move forward steadily. If we do not pay serious attention to this point again, we will make big mistakes. (2) The speed of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization is overestimated, and insufficient learning has been done from the Soviet Union's construction experience, and it is not understood how to determine the various tasks of rural work and agricultural production based on the development speed of national industrialization and the current agricultural conditions. (3) There is an unclear understanding of the need to rely mainly on the law of value to guide the small-scale peasant economy into the national economic plan. It is desired to apply the accuracy and obedience of planning that should exist in state-owned farms to the conditions of the small-scale peasant economy, and planning is regarded as "omnipotent." The focus of work is not placed on correctly grasping the Party's policies and doing a good job in economic and political work. (4) The imbalance of rural work and the small-scale peasant economy is not deeply understood, so it is often generally required for various regions and rigid regulations are made for various tasks. The unity of guiding principles and flexibility in adapting to local conditions are not unified, and the initiative of various regions to carry out work based on the actual conditions of the region is given play under the unified principles and policies. (5) There is a lack of comprehensive leadership thinking that meets the needs of the current period of national economic construction. The "single fight" method used during the recovery period and the land reform and liberation war periods is still being used for leadership. We have been simply engaged in mutual aid and cooperation, and have relaxed the policy and ideological leadership of rural departments. (6) The actual situation below is not fully and accurately grasped, which affects the correct solution of the problem. (7) There is insufficient listening to the opinions of the lower-level masses and cadres, and there is a rash problem of being hasty and doing things based on enthusiasm. In the future, we must closely connect with the masses, promote democracy, and listen to various opinions.

Specific measures to improve the above problems:

(1) In accordance with the spirit of the central government's instructions on rural work, and closely combined with the actual situation in the province, revise certain plans for rural work and agricultural production this year and in the next five years to make them more realistic. When formulating plans, they should be combined from top to bottom and from bottom to top, repeatedly calculated, and carefully decided.

(2) Strive to learn, strengthen the comprehensiveness and foresight of leadership thinking, unify the leadership of rural work from the policy and ideological aspects, conduct inspections in a step-by-step manner, and help the work of various aspects related to agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, technical promotion, supply and marketing, credit, and farm implements, so as to summarize experience, determine guiding principles, overcome shortcomings, and consolidate achievements.

(3) Adhere to the policy of focusing on promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, adhere to the policy of a steady and progressive mutual aid and cooperation movement, adhere to the method of implementing key experiments, summarizing experience, and gradually promoting anything new, adhere to the leadership method of typical demonstrations, persuasion and education. Deal with existing problems gradually and appropriately according to different situations.

(4) Improve the quality of the work of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee. The Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee should strengthen the grasp and analysis of the situation, strive to be comprehensive, timely, accurate, and principled, improve the initiative and creativity in work, improve the leadership style, adhere to starting from reality, promote democracy, gather ideas, and listen to the voices of the masses and cadres; when making decisions on major issues, it is necessary to think deeply and calculate repeatedly from the positive and negative sides, it is better to be later, but it must be more accurate. It is necessary to strengthen the planning of work and implement a system of quarterly inspection of work.

    黑龙江省的农村工作要从何着手继续提高
    ——中共黑龙江省委给东北局的农村工作检查报告
    编者按：这是中共黑龙江省委向中共中央东北局所作的一个报告，这个报告较系统地检查了黑龙江省在农村工作和农业生产政策上的许多重大问题和缺点、错误，并较深刻地分析了它们的思想根源。这些问题和缺点、错误在其他省份也是存在的。各地领导机关和农村工作部门，可以参考这个报告，进一步检查在农村工作上的各种问题，分析原因，定出改进办法。
    黑龙江省委农村工作部以中央有关农村工作的指示、文件为武器，就今春以来三次深入农村所发现的问题，作了比较系统的检查。
    黑龙江省在今年春耕生产方面是有一定成就的。我们抓住了春耕生产中的几个主要问题：一、进行了政策补课，消除了农民的思想顾虑，提高了农民扩大生产的积极性。二、在一部分互助组中认真贯彻了互利政策；在较正常的情况下建立了若干农业生产合作社。三、重点推广肇源经验取得了一定的效果。今年春耕生产一般行动较早，进度较快，田间耕作质量较好，给今年农业增产打下了良好基础。但是，今年我省农业生产任务和今后农村工作的要求，仍是十分繁重的；同时，我们工作中还有许多缺点和错误。对于这些缺点和错误，如不很好地加以揭发纠正，将会严重地影响今年农业生产和其它农村工作任务的完成。
    （一）在制订一九五三年和今后五年的农业生产计划和其它农村主要工作的计划时，对本省实际情况研究不够。这些计划有偏高、偏大的毛病。我们曾要求粮食生产于五年内在一九五二年计划产量基础上提高百分之百；要求农业生产合作社今年全部推广肇源经验，改良耕作法，要求它们的单位面积产量比当地好的互助组提高百分之二十到三十，并要有百分之二十的土地创造每垧产原粮十五石到二十石的高额产量，五种主要作物要分别出现半垧至一垧的每垧产量二十石以上的新纪录地。对新老社这样统一要求，现在看来是过高了。在扩大耕地面积方面，要求到一九五七年达到五百万垧，也过多了。在互助合作方面，我们曾要求在五年内占百分之八十的农户参加农业生产合作社和集体农庄；以每社平均二十五户计算，要发展到三万四千二百六十八个社；集体农庄按每个农庄一百户计算，要建立一百个。这都是不合实际的。一九五三年要求新建一千二百个社，实际只建成七百一十七个。现有的两个集体农庄的巩固工作已经十分艰难，更不要说开展新的集体农庄了。在技术推广方面：开始对肇源经验要求“全面推广”“大力推广”，把宣传和实际要求混同起来。干部下乡时农民对这提出了意见，在全省劳动模范代表会议上农民也提出了意见，我们都没有重视，这是一个深刻的教训。在信贷方面：我们曾要求五年内各供销社普遍建立信贷部，一九五三年就要在三分之二的供销社建立信贷部。因此，有些供销社就强迫群众存款以至存牛、存马，引起群众不满，增加了群众的顾虑。由于我们领导方面有这些过高的要求，就直接影响了各县、区要求过高、计划太大。如海伦县提出：五年内粮食产量提高百分之一百一十四，今年产量要求比一九五二年提高百分之四十；该县十四区要求平均每垧产粮十五石。这些都是远远脱离实际的。
    （二）在互助合作的某些政策的掌握上和在实际工作的指导上也有盲目急躁情绪。一九五二年对于很多自发组成的农业生产合作社事先控制不够，发觉后也未能立即帮助他们进行改组工作，一直拖延到冬天，才基本上解决了这个问题。农业生产合作社的公共财产积累过多，摊子过大，债务过重，经营方针不明确，过分强调集体生活、统一计划消费等现象，在一九五二年六月就发现了，但在同年八月农业生产合作社代表会上也没有明确地提出加以纠正和防止，直到今年一月才坚决纠正。国家银行和供销社对少数社、组盲目地过多扶助的现象，我们虽然早已指出，但具体组织有关部门及时控制做得不够，以致仍然形成了普遍的偏向。绥化县委提出一九五三年民吉村基本上普遍建立合作社，经我们批准并在党刊发表；事后发觉过急，才又通知制止。牧畜业合作化的方向是正确的，但是只提积极稳步开展，没有明确地规定先行个别试办的步骤，控制不严，下面也发生了急于求成的现象。我们直接领导建立的两个集体农庄，一开始庄员就是在一起吃饭的，对其它农业生产合作社影响不小。两农庄贷款过多、摊子过大，与我们领导方面的盲目急躁情绪也有很大关系。
    （三）在技术推广和技术改革方面，也有严重的盲目冒进偏向。在农具推广方面，重数量不重质量，新式马拉农具的作用发挥得很不够，有严重的损失浪费；强调集中发放，与互助合作的基础不相适应。马拉农具发放给互助组的有六百九十八套，占全部已发放的新式农具的百分之五十七；但互助组土地少，马力缺，未打开地界，用新式农具很难发挥作用。每套新式农具能耕种八十垧地；现在全省由新式农具耕作的土地面积共二万四千垧，平均每套只种二十垧。一九五二年的实验证明，每垧地用新式农具比用旧农具可增产二石左右。每套种二十垧，可增产四十石粮，合六百万元（十五万元一石高粱）。每套新式农具成本是五千万元，要分三年按二、三、五比例还清；加上银行利息九厘，第一年要偿还一、五四○万元，（合一百零二石多粮），第二年付一、九三二万元（合一百二十八石多粮），第三年付二、七七○万元（合一百八十四石多粮），再加上检修费，农民每年要赔五六十石粮。
    在旧农具改良方面，重复了过去的错误。方针不明确，不慎重，有轻率提倡的毛病。许多县的旧农具自上而下统一制造多，发动群众自己动手制造少；结果粗制滥造，规格不一，质量差，不实用，价格高，大量积压。只是省供销联合总社就积压了水泥磙子、割槎机、改良耲耙、点葫芦、小耙等二万三千五百多件。各县供销社也积压了许多，如绥化就积压了不能用的改良耲耙五百台，讷河积压铧子四千条、铁犁一千多台。
    在粪肥、化学肥料、农药的推广方面，不是就地取材，从农民的切身经验出发，而是盲目采购推销，不计成本，积压很多。大粪采购范围遍及内蒙、大连、营口、沈阳、哈尔滨，共买进十九万六千四百六十吨，只卖出一万一千七百七十吨。全省共买进硫安一千三百吨，仅克山、依安、克东、富裕、拜泉五县就积压了七百三十五吨。在推销时不根据土质、作物的需要，北部黑土不缺氮肥，仍然推销硫酸氨。拜泉共有五万垧大豆，就推销了六万包根瘤菌，超过需要量（按：一包根瘤菌够一垧多地用）。全省估计积压赛力散八万三千斤左右，许多地方发生强迫摊派现象。海伦海南区有的农民被迫买了赛力散后挖坑埋上；克山县有的地方把赛力散推销到了不种小麦的老乡手里，影响很坏。群众讽刺说：“一去三里三（赛力散），回来六里六（六六六粉），最后来个根底紧（根瘤菌）”。
    在耕作技术改革方面，不是典型试验，逐步推广，而产生了强迫命令现象。如去秋省府农业厅和省委农村工作部都曾数次用电报催促各县抓紧秋翻地，这是必要的；但催得太紧，数字要求过高，各县区就发生了强迫命令现象；地已上冻了，还打电报催促。海伦有些农民被迫在夜里打灯笼翻地。因为领导方面要求农业生产合作社百分之三、四十的耕地都要耕翻，有的地方竟动员互助组的人马工给合作社翻地。讷河土地已冻了二寸深，县委还要群众翻地，有一个互助组翻地打了八个铧子、拉坏了三个耍杆子，还受到县委表扬。群众反映：“犁辕子拉湾了，老儿马子累粘了，湿土翻干了。”由于群众不自愿，许多地方翻地的质量差，又未及时耙平镇压，因此不能保墒，农民很不满意。
    在牲畜繁殖和改良品种工作上，也是盲目铺摊子。全省建立牧畜指导站八十七处、指导所三十八处（四十二处配种站在外），共有干部四百七十名，人事厅没有批准，经费是在农业厅事业费中开支的。几年来在配种工作上有些成绩，但毛病也不少。如萨尔图牧畜试验场的牲畜是：喂料多、配种少，流产多、揣驹少，死的多、活的少。一九五二年秋省农业厅在国家农贷中以二十亿元在内蒙买回母牛二千头，强调“引进种”，贷给两个集体农庄及安达、杜旗、三肇地区一带农民。买时没有严格检查，其中一部分带来了牛肺疫病；而且价格高于本省。（八十四万元一头，比本地中等牛贵二十多万元）。据已知道的，先后在集体农庄及其它地方死去了四百多头，死一头由国家包偿二十万元。群众对此不满，称这些牛是“一套长，三尺高，拉稀屎，罗锅腰”。
    技术指导站的建立是需要的，工作也有成绩；但在发展上有重数量不重质量的毛病。现全省有二百零一处指导站，共一千零三十四人。其中有的干部技术水平过低，在技术指导上出了不少毛病。望奎九区站干部刘耀先给群众作温水浸种，手拿着表坐在炕上，让老太太烧火，结果把种籽煮熟了。站的方针任务不明确，上级七个指示，本省四个规定，说法各有不同，造成混乱现象。有的站提出的方针是
    “发展经济，巩固国防”；克山七区古城站长说他们的方针任务是“深入党团，抓住思想，解决一系列的问题”。
    （四）在国营农场工作方面，从去年冬季以来，领导工作有很大的改进，确已做出一定成绩；但仍然有成本高、计划大、贪多冒进的情绪，领导仍然不够全面。全省去年农场实产量平均为二千三百九十斤粮食，今年计划就要求平均产粮五千五百六十斤。据三十个农场的统计，非直接生产人员占全部人员的百分之二十三点二。全省农场平均一垧地成本费合一百四十万元。据三十五个农场统计，工薪即占成本的百分之五十三。九三农场今年投资二百亿元。牛棚盖砖瓦；工人宿舍盖甲等房；修理厂本来是可用的，还化三十亿元来修。耕地已经够种了，还开荒一千二百垧。不少县尚未把农场工作列入议事日程，对于办好国营农场的重大意义认识不够。
    （五）在省委农村工作部机关工作和领导作风方面有以下缺点：（1）掌握情况不够全面，不够及时，不够准确，材料分散零碎，集中研究分析很少，要用临时抓，经常积累研究材料不够，影响领导方面的及时指导，所以有时形成“马后炮”，缺乏预见。（2）领导思想不够全面，抓互助合作工作多，对农业厅、林业厅及其他有关方面的工作过问少；检查工作到大县多，到小县少；看报告也喜欢看大县的，不大愿意看小县的。下去检查工作时扣毛病多，对县区帮助少；单独摸经验多，总结群众经验少。（3）作风上有急躁的毛病，对重大问题深思熟虑、反复计算利弊作得不够，轻率决定，急于求成，常以愿望代替实际。简单交代具体任务多，思想酝酿反复研究少；布置工作一般要求多，对地区差别照顾少，有时机械规定材料要“整齐”，写起来就是老一套。结果情况是啰嗦的，成绩办法是抽象的，问题是不具体的，经验是干巴的。
    以上这些缺点和错误的影响是很大的：（1）由于我们领导方面计划大、要求高，有某些急躁情绪，有主观主义、官僚主义的毛病，这就助长了下面各级工作同志的急躁冒进和基层干部的强迫命令作风。（2）由于急躁冒进，有的地方侵犯了农民所有权，损害了中农利益，损伤了一部分农民的生产积极性。（3）许多好事办成坏事，劳民伤财，积压了国家资金，损失了人民财产，减少了粮食产量，使党和人民政府在政治上受到很大损失。
    产生这些毛病的基本原因是：（1）对分散的、个体的小农经济现状认识不够。做农村工作而不熟悉农民和农村现状，把个体经济的农民和在此基础上组织起来的互助合作组织当做集体农民和集体农庄去要求；把一部分积极分子、先进农民的觉悟，当做全体农民的情绪；把将来的远景，当作今天现实的计划。这是要求高、计划大、盲目急躁冒进的主要根源。满足于小农现状，自流放任，是错误的；但今后一个较长时期，农村工作、农业生产的任何措施和要求，都必须从小农经济现状出发，从农民的切身经验出发，从保护农民利益发挥农民生产积极性出发，稳步前进。再不严重注意这一点，就要犯大错误。（2）    对国家工业化和农业合作化的速度估计过高，对苏联的建设经验学习不够，不懂得根据国家工业化的发展速度和现今农业条件来确定农村工作和农业生产的各项任务。（3）对于主要应依靠价值法则去引导小农经济纳入国家经济计划认识不清，想把在国营农场中应有的计划的准确性和服从性，搬到小农经济情况下来应用，把计划看成“万能”的，没有把工作重心放在正确掌握党的政策和搞好经济工作与政治工作上面。（4）对农村工作和小农经济的不平衡性认识不深，因而常常是对各种地区一般要求，对各种任务硬性规定，没有把方针原则的统一性和因地制宜的灵活性统一起来，在统一的原则方针下，发挥各地区根据本地区实际情况进行工作的主动性。（5）缺乏适应目前国家经济建设时期的需要的全面领导思想，仍然采用着恢复时期以及土地改革、解放战争时期“单打一”的办法进行领导。我们曾单纯搞互助合作，放松了对农村有关部门工作的政策思想领导。（6）对下面实际情况掌握得不够全面，不够准确，影响对问题的正确解决。（7）倾听下层群众、干部的意见不够，有粗枝大叶凭热情办事的急躁毛病。今后必须密切联系群众，发扬民主，倾听各种不同的意见。
    改进上述毛病的具体办法：
    （1）根据中央关于农村工作的指示的精神，密切结合本省实际情况，修改今年和五年农村工作、农业生产的某些计划，使之更切合实际。制定计划时要自上而下与自下而上结合起来进行，反复计算，慎重决定。
    （2）努力学习，加强领导思想的全面性和预见性，从政策思想方面统一对农村工作的领导，有步骤地进行检查，帮助有关农林、水利、技术推广、供销、信贷、农具等各方面的工作，从而总结经验，确定方针，克服缺点，巩固成绩。
    （3）坚持重点推广肇源丰产经验的方针，坚持稳步前进的互助合作运动的方针，坚持推行任何一件新的东西必须实行重点试验、总结经验、逐步推广的方法，坚持典型示范、说服教育的领导方法。对现存的问题，分别情况，逐步妥善处理。
    （4）提高省委农村工作部机关工作的质量。省委农村工作部要加强对情况的掌握和分析工作，争取做到全面、及时、准确和有原则，提高工作上的主动性和创造性，改进领导作风，坚持从实际出发，发扬民主，集思广益，倾听群众和干部的呼声；对重大问题做出决策时，要深思熟虑，从正面反面反复计算，宁可晚些，但要准些。要加强工作的计划性，实行按季检查工作的制度。
