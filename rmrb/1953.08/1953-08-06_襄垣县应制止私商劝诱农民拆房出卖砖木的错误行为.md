    Xiangyuan County Should Stop the Erroneous Behavior of Private Merchants Enticing Farmers to Demolish Houses and Sell Bricks and Wood
    Lian Zhishui of the Xiangyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province writes: Recently, Xiangyuan County has seen many farmers demolishing houses to sell wood and bricks. According to investigations, in Chengguan and six villages including Dongnan Shang Village, thirty households have demolished eighty-three good houses and three very good temples (totaling twenty-five rooms) since last year. They sold more than 50,000 bricks and rafters from twenty rooms, worth approximately 30 million yuan. Dongnan Shang Village alone demolished and sold twenty-three good houses, accounting for more than six percent of the total number of houses in the village.
    Why is this happening? It is understood that because some construction units in Changzhi and our county town are buying wood and bricks on the market, many private merchants are actively engaging in activities in the countryside, looking at houses and estimating prices everywhere, and persuading farmers to sell wood and bricks. Some farmers, because of temporary economic difficulties or being enticed by private merchants, demolish and sell their houses. This is obviously very detrimental to rural construction. Moreover, as far as I know, some farmers lost money when they demolished old brick houses to build new earthen houses. I suggest that the Xiangyuan County People's Government pay attention to this issue. On the one hand, they should strengthen the management of private merchants and stop them from enticing farmers to demolish houses; on the other hand, they should educate farmers not to demolish houses arbitrarily to prevent the continuation of similar situations.

### 襄垣县应制止私商劝诱农民拆房出卖砖木的错误行为

    襄垣县应制止私商劝诱农民拆房出卖砖木的错误行为
    中共山西省襄垣县委会连治水来信：最近襄垣县发现不少农民拆房子出卖木料砖瓦的事情。据调查，城关和东南上村等六村从去年到现在，已有三十户农民拆了好房八十三间、很好的庙宇三座（计二十五间），卖了砖瓦五万余块，椽檩二十间，共值约三千万元。其中东南上村一村就拆卖了好房二十三间，占全村房屋总数的百分之六以上。
    为什么会产生这种情况呢？据了解，因为长治和我县城里某些建筑单位在市上收买木料和砖瓦，不少私商就到农村去大肆活动，到处看房估价，劝农民出卖木料砖瓦。有些农民因为一时经济上有困难或者被私商所诱惑，就将房屋拆卖了。这对农村建设显然是很不利的。而且据我所知，有些农民拆了旧砖屋另盖新土房时，反而赔了钱。建议襄垣县人民政府注意这个问题，一方面要对私商加强管理，制止他们劝诱农民拆房的做法；另一方面要教育农民不要任意拆房，以防止类似情况的继续发生。
