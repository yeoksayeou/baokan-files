People from all walks of life in Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Xi'an, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Jinan, Qingdao, and Andong unanimously welcomed the realization of the Korean armistice.

    The people of Shanghai greeted the joyous news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement with excitement and encouragement. In many factories, schools, and neighborhoods, radio broadcasts, blackboard bulletins, and big-character posters quickly announced this news marking the victory of peace. At the construction site of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Dormitory, construction workers happily listened to the news of the Korean armistice and were very concerned about the post-war life and construction of the Korean people. Wang Jinlan, the director of the construction site, was a Second-Class People's Hero of Anti-American Resistance and Aid Korea who returned to production after being wounded in the Korean War. He called on everyone at the general workers' meeting to work hard to build the motherland and support the Korean people in their reconstruction efforts. More than 300 family members of martyrs and military personnel at the Hongkou District Revolutionary Family Handicraft Cooperative also felt honored and gratified by the signing of the armistice agreement after hearing the broadcast. While excited and encouraged, the people of Shanghai also heightened their vigilance. Workers, cadres, and students at units such as the Qiujiang Machine Factory, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Dormitory construction site, the Wusong Machine Factory, the State-owned Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory, the State-owned Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory, the Cement Products Factory of the Municipal Engineering Bureau, the Hengtong Yarn Factory, and the Second Military Medical University of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held symposiums and unanimously expressed their determination to be vigilant against the sabotage activities of US imperialism and Syngman Rhee against the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    On the evening of the 30th, people from all walks of life in Tianjin held a gathering at the China Grand Theater to celebrate the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    Li Huasheng, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, spoke at the meeting. He described the brilliant victories achieved by the people of China and Korea in the anti-aggression war over the past three years, and the great contributions made by the people of Tianjin in the movement to resist America and aid Korea. Li Huasheng called on the people of the city to actively participate in national construction, assist the Korean people in restoring production, and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Representatives from the Tianjin local organizations of various democratic parties, such as Yang Yizhou, and worker representatives also spoke at the meeting.

    Li Zhaozhen, a well-known national model worker and deputy director of the first sewing department of the Tianjin Clothing Factory, said: "Our working class warmly welcomes the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. For more than two years, our clothing workers have actively produced and overfulfilled our tasks every time to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, which is precisely to achieve peace in Korea as soon as possible." Tan Suyun, a female worker in the first workshop of the Zhonghua Match Factory, said: "In the future, we must intensify production to both build our motherland and help the Korean people recover from the wounds of war." Wang Guangying, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce and manager of the private Jindai Chemical Factory, said: "The industrial and commercial sectors should further promote the spirit of patriotism, actively manage their businesses, and build the motherland."

    On the day the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, Sang Jingxuan, a model family member of a Chinese People's Volunteer Army hero and military family member in Shenyang, wrote a letter to his son in the Volunteer Army, asking him not to relax his efforts as in the past until the Korean issue is resolved peacefully.

    Students, doctors, and citizens in Wuhan unanimously expressed their support for the armistice agreement. Li Lingfei and five other physicians from internal medicine and surgery at Hankou Union Hospital held a symposium after hearing the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. These doctors, who had volunteered to go to Korea to participate in medical work between March 1951 and July this year, explained through their observations while working in Korea that the success of the armistice negotiations was mainly the result of the continuous strengthening of our forces and continuous efforts.

    Xu Lan, a female member of the fourth delegation of the Chinese People's Anti-American Resistance and Aid Korea General Association to Korea and a Young Pioneer, expressed her willingness to go to Korea again to慰问 the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    Workers at the Xi'an Northwest Agricultural Implement Factory talked about the news of the Korean armistice everywhere. The members of the Wang Shusen model group said: "Our resistance to America and aid to Korea is precisely to strive for peace. In the future, we must work harder to produce, strengthen the forces of peace, and strive for the full implementation of the armistice agreement." Farmers in the suburbs were filled with joy when they heard the news of the Korean armistice. Chen Zongfa, a first-class model family member of a volunteer soldier in Huangqutou Village, said that he would write to his son Chen Wenxiang and tell him to be more vigilant and never relax.

Wang Xinting, Director of the Political Department of the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, spoke at the meeting. He called on all commanders and combatants of the Southwest Military Region to vigilantly defend the motherland's defense from any infringement.

    People from all walks of life in Chongqing have expressed their willingness to do various jobs well as a gift to celebrate the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Ran Ruitu, director of surgery at the Chongqing Second People's Hospital, who was commended by the leadership of the Volunteer Army for his service in Korea, said that he would further unite the city's medical staff to better serve the Volunteer Army's wounded and sick soldiers recuperating in Chongqing. One hundred and twenty-six graduating students from the Chongqing Women's Normal School are about to take up teaching positions. They said: "We must do a good job as teachers and cultivate talents for the next generation of the motherland to answer the Volunteer Army comrades."

    On the day the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement reached the Guangzhou Railway Administration's locomotive depot, railway workers spread the word and said that they would celebrate the victory of the Chinese and Korean people by intensifying production. Thanks to the efforts of foreman Luo Gui and the cleaning and inspection workers, the efficiency of washing and inspecting locomotives increased by 40% that day.

    Chen Yuzhen, a model family member of a volunteer soldier in Nanjing, wrote a letter to her son Wu Baotong, encouraging him and saying, "As long as you are in Korea, you must help the Korean people engage in post-war construction, just like producing for your own family and building the motherland." Li Shilin, a model of safe operation at the Xiaguan Power Plant, said that in the future, he would strictly implement operating procedures and safely transmit electricity to increase the country's economic and defense strength.

    When the news of the Korean armistice reached Jinan City, all the employees of the Jinan Second Machine Factory immediately cheered. The workers are celebrating this victory with new efforts in production. The children of the Hou Man children's support-the-army model group of the Jinan County West Alley Elementary School, a famous model group in Shandong Province for giving preferential treatment to military families, wrote a letter that night to the Young Pioneers of the Shuyuanli People's School in Bicheng County, Korea, expressing their desire to join hands with Korean children to welcome the days of peaceful construction.
