    The Soviet people, closely united around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, with an unshakable belief in their cause, are confidently marching along the path of communism, persistently striving for world peace. The domestic and foreign policies, formulated by the Communist Party and tested through decades of experience, enjoy the unlimited trust and support of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. The purpose of this policy is to develop the economy and culture of our motherland, to consolidate the socialist system and strengthen our national defense in every possible way, to continuously improve the welfare of the people and ensure the peaceful labor of the Soviet people, to maintain world peace and prevent a new war.

    Since its founding, the Soviet state has been a consistent and unwavering fighter for peace, international cooperation, and friendship among all countries. G.M. Malenkov, in his speech at the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, said that for the Soviet government, for all of us Soviet people, the cause of consolidating peace and ensuring the security of the world's people is not a matter of tactics or diplomatic maneuvering. This is the general line of our foreign policy.

    The Soviet government's foreign policy not only fully conforms to the fundamental interests of the Soviet people, but also coincides with the vital interests and aspirations of the people of other countries. The noble goals of this policy are dear and understandable to all countries and progressive humanity that are closely concerned with maintaining peace. Millions of people in all countries look with hope and confidence to the great Soviet Union, a powerful bastion of peace and a staunch defender of the freedom and independence of all peoples. Through the persistent and unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the entire democratic camp, significant achievements have recently been made in the struggle to ease international tensions, for peace, and to stop a new world war. All honest people around the world happily welcome the cessation of the bloody tragedy in Korea, which had destroyed so many lives and harbored the threat of extremely serious international conflicts. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a great victory for peace-loving people. The Soviet Union's persistent and consistent efforts for peace led to the failure of the provocative adventure by the imperialist mercenaries in Berlin, the instigators and organizers of which pursued far-reaching goals.

    The improvement of relations with neighboring countries is also an achievement of the Soviet Union in its struggle to ease international tensions. The Soviet Union's aim is to raise these relations to a level of genuine harmony between neighboring countries. The Soviet Union has no territorial ambitions towards any country, including its neighbors. The unshakable principle of Soviet foreign policy is to respect the national freedom and sovereignty of any country, regardless of size. In order to consolidate peace, the Soviet government has always pursued a policy of expanding economic ties with foreign countries and has fought for the restoration of normal trade relations between all countries. Significant achievements have been made in this regard.

    The Soviet government attaches particular importance to further strengthening close cooperation and fraternal friendship with the countries of the democratic camp. Great and solid friendship connects the Soviet Union with the People's Republic of China. The multifaceted cooperation between the Soviet Union and Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is expanding and strengthening. The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic are constantly strengthening. The fraternal cooperation among the countries of the democratic camp is constantly growing and strengthening. The democratic camp is solid and unbreakable, it has no internal contradictions and struggles, unlike the imperialist camp. The most important source of the strength and progress of the democratic camp is the mutual concern for the interests of all countries in the democratic camp, as well as close, mutually beneficial, and equal economic cooperation. At present, the international position of the Soviet Union is more consolidated than ever before, and it has won great prestige and trust among millions of people in countries all over the world in its unwavering struggle against the threat of a new war, in fraternal solidarity with the powerful democratic camp.

    The forces of aggression cannot turn back the course of history. The people of the people's democratic countries have embarked on the road to a new life and will never leave it. The victory of the free people of the democratic camp, who have freed themselves from imperialist oppression and are pursuing an independent and autonomous policy, has aroused the fury of those who are accustomed to exploiting others for their own benefit. In order to sabotage the cause of consolidating peace and hinder the further normalization of the international situation, the forces of aggression are doing everything possible to obstruct the peaceful settlement of outstanding issues, establish military bases in West Germany and Japan, organize provocations against the countries of the democratic camp, and pursue a policy of atomic blackmail. Such unscrupulous subversive activities as are now being carried out by the aggressive forces, such blatant interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and the raising of international provocations to the level of government policy, have never been seen before in the history of international relations. The United States is openly allocating hundreds of millions of dollars to carry out destructive and inciting activities against other countries, even at the cost of undermining the basic principles and practices of international relations. The infamous "Cold War strategy," which aims to sharpen the international situation, is poisoning relations between countries.

    The current stage in the development of international relations is particularly important. People hate war and sincerely yearn for peace. Any government that is sincerely concerned about the fate of its people has a responsibility to take measures to promote the settlement of international disputes and not allow the already emerging improvement in the international atmosphere to give way to a renewed intensification of tensions.

    Under the current balance of power, with the Soviet Union and the countries of the democratic camp resolutely defending their vital interests in the international arena, the policy of peaceful coexistence between the two systems is not only the responsibility of the countries of the democratic camp, but also the responsibility of all countries. The other path is a path of desperate adventure and inevitable failure. The Supreme Soviet emphasized that the Soviet government will firmly and resolutely pursue a policy of defending and consolidating peace, cooperate and develop business relations with those countries that are willing to cooperate and develop business relations, and strengthen fraternal friendship and solidarity with the great Chinese people and all the people's democratic countries. The Communist Party and the Soviet government have always been firmly in favor of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between the two systems. Their starting point is that there are now no disputes or outstanding issues, including the disputes existing between the United States and the Soviet Union, that cannot be resolved peacefully on the basis of mutual agreement among the countries concerned.

    The Soviet foreign policy program is clear and obvious. All those who sincerely advocate peace and friendship among nations support the Soviet foreign policy program because it corresponds to the heartfelt aspirations of the peoples of all countries. Our cause is invincible. The Soviet people are more united than ever before, their strength is growing, and they are marching towards new victories in the construction of communism. The democratic camp, composed of free countries that account for one-third of the world's population, is more united than ever before and is a powerful obstacle in the path of aggressive forces seeking to launch a new war. Hundreds of millions of people believe and hope that international tensions will be further eased. The noble hopes of the people should not and cannot be deceived. As long as the people of all countries are vigilant and do their best to expose the plots and intrigues of imperialism and do not allow the aggressors to realize their plans, peace will surely be guaranteed.

    巩固和平和保障各国安全的政策
    ——苏联“真理报”八月十三日社论
    苏联人民紧密团结在共产党和苏联政府的周围，对自己的事业抱着不可动摇的信念，他们正满怀信心地沿着共产主义道路迈进，坚持地为世界和平而斗争。由共产党制定、并经过数十年的经验考验过的国内政策和对外政策，得到苏联各民族的无限信任和支持。这个政策的目的是：发展我们祖国的经济和文化，多方巩固社会主义制度和加强我国国防力量，不断增进人民的福利和保障苏联人民的和平劳动，维护世界和平和防止新战争。
    苏维埃国家立国以来就是一贯不变地为和平和国际合作、为各国友好而奋斗的战士。格·马·马林科夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上发表演说时说，对苏联政府，对我们全体苏联人民说来，巩固和平和保证世界人民安全的事业不是一个策略或外交手腕的问题。这就是我们在对外政策方面的总路线。
    苏联政府的对外政策不仅完全符合苏联人民的根本利益，而且跟其他各国人民的切身利益和愿望也是一致的。这个政策的崇高目标对于所有血肉相关地关心维护和平的各国人民和进步人类，都是亲切的和可以理解的。各国千百万人都怀着希望和信心仰望着强大的和平堡垒、各国人民的自由和独立的忠实捍卫者伟大的苏联。经过苏联、中华人民共和国、整个民主阵营坚持不懈的努力，最近以来为缓和国际紧张局势、为和平和制止新世界大战而进行的斗争获得了重大的成就。全世界所有正直的人都愉快地欢迎朝鲜流血惨剧的停止，这种流血惨剧曾毁灭了许许多多人的性命，并蕴藏过极其严重的国际纠纷的威胁。朝鲜停战协定的签订是爱好和平的人民的伟大胜利。苏联为和平而作的坚持不懈的一贯努力，使得帝国主义雇佣分子在柏林的挑衅冒险遭到失败，这个事件的鼓动者和组织者所追求的目的是深远的。
    与邻邦关系的改善也是苏联在为缓和国际紧张局势而进行的斗争中取得的成绩。苏联的目的是要把这种关系提高到邻国之间关系真正和睦的水平。苏联对任何国家，包括邻国在内，都没有领土野心。苏联对外政策的不可动摇的原则是，尊重任何一国（不问大小）的民族自由和主权。为了巩固和平，苏联政府一向奉行扩大与外国进行经济联系的政策，为恢复各国之间的正常贸易关系而斗争。在这方面已经获得了显著的成就。
    苏联政府特别重视进一步加强与民主阵营各国的密切合作和兄弟友好关系。伟大的坚固的友好关系把苏联跟中华人民共和国联系在一起。苏联跟波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚，跟蒙古人民共和国，跟朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的多方面的合作日益扩大，日益加强。苏联跟德意志民主共和国的友好关系不断地加强着。民主阵营各国的兄弟合作不断增长，不断加强。民主阵营是巩固的，坚不可破的，它没有内部的矛盾和斗争，而帝国主义阵营却不是这样。民主阵营的力量和进步的最主要的源泉，是对于民主阵营一切国家的利益的互相关切，以及进行密切的、互利的、平等的经济合作。目前苏联的国际地位比以前任何时候都更加巩固，它在与强大的民主阵营兄弟般的团结一致中，坚持不渝地进行反对新战争威胁的斗争，在世界各国千百万人民中间赢得了巨大的威望和信任。
    侵略势力是不能把历史进程扭向后转的。人民民主国家人民已经走上了新生活的道路，并且永远不会离开这条道路了。摆脱了帝国主义压迫并执行着独立自主的政策的民主阵营各国自由人民的胜利，引起了那些惯于利用别人来为自己谋取利益的人们的狂怒。侵略势力为了破坏巩固和平的事业，阻挠国际形势的进一步正常化，便千方百计地阻碍和平解决悬而未决的问题，在西德和日本建立军事基地，对民主阵营各国组织挑衅，以及奉行原子弹讹诈政策。像侵略力量现在所进行的这样肆无忌惮的颠覆活动，这样露骨地干涉其他国家的内政，把国际挑衅提高到政府政策的水平上，在国际关系史上还从来没有过。美国竟不惜破坏国际关系的基本准则和惯例，公开拨出数以亿计的美元来对其他国家进行破坏活动和煽动活动。臭名远扬的“冷战战略”的目的是要促使国际形势尖锐化，它正在毒害着国与国之间的关系。
    国际关系发展过程中的现阶段是特别重要的。人民仇恨战争，他们衷心渴望和平。任何一个真诚关心自己人民的命运的政府，都有责任采取措施以促成国际争执问题的解决，不要使已经出现的国际气氛的好转让位于紧张局势的重新加强。
    在目前的力量对比的情况下，在苏联和民主阵营各国坚决在国际舞台上保卫自己切身利益的情况下，执行两个制度和平共处的政策，不但只是民主阵营各国的责任，而且也是一切国家的责任。另外的道路是绝望的冒险和必然失败的道路。最高苏维埃会议强调指出，苏联政府将坚定不移地、坚决地执行保卫和巩固和平的政策，与那些愿意合作和发展事务关系的国家进行合作和发展事务关系，加强与伟大的中国人民和所有人民民主国家的兄弟友谊和团结。共产党和苏联政府过去和现在都是坚决主张两个制度和平共处与和平竞赛的。它们的出发点是：现在没有任何争端或未决问题，包括美国和苏联之间存在的争执问题在内，不能在有关各国互相协议的基础上和平解决的。
    苏联外交政策纲领是明显而清楚的。一切真诚拥护和平与各国友好的人都拥护苏联的外交政策纲领，因为这一纲领是符合各国人民的衷心的愿望的。我们的事业是战无不胜的。苏联人民比以前任何时候都更加团结一致，他们的力量在壮大，他们正向建设共产主义的新的胜利迈进。占全人类人口三分之一的、由自由国家组成的民主阵营，比以前任何时候都更加团结一致，成为企图发动新战争的侵略势力的道路上的强大障碍。数以亿计的人们相信并希望，国际紧张局势将得到进一步的缓和。人民的崇高希望是不应当而且不可能受到欺骗的。只要各国人民警惕，并尽力揭露帝国主义的阴谋诡计，不让侵略者实现他们的计划，那么和平就一定会得到保障。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科十三日电）
