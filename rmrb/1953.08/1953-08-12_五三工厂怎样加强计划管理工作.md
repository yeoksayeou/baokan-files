How Factory 53 Strengthens Planning Management

Factory Director of Factory 53 Gao Fangqi

In strengthening planning management, Factory 53 has further improved the production balance rate and ensured the early completion of the national plan for the first half of the year by focusing on the key link of improving the operation plan, rectifying the original records, strengthening dispatching, improving the responsibility system, and improving the work of the departments. In June, the balance rate of the main products of Factory 53 reached 97.39%, an increase of 0.34% over May. In May, labor productivity increased by 22.95% compared with the plan. Our process of strengthening planning management with the operation plan as the center is roughly as follows:

I. Conduct in-depth publicity and education to workers and establish the ideological foundation for planning management.

After carefully studying the instructions and materials on strengthening planning management, we formulated a comprehensive work plan for strengthening planning management based on the current situation of the factory. First, we explained the content and importance of planning management to the workers and organized discussions. At the same time, we organized the factory's propaganda forces to carry out work so that workers generally understand the importance of planning management and its main practices.

Of course, this work cannot completely dispel workers' concerns and completely clarify their wrong ideas. During the inspection, it was found that some workers, especially auxiliary workers, believed that strengthening planning management had nothing to do with them; some believed that balanced production meant that overproduction was not allowed; and some believed that the production tasks were not fixed and could not be balanced.

In view of the above situation, we decided to further use popular and easy-to-understand forms of propaganda in combination with the actual situation of the workshop. For example, through the planning management exhibition, we explained the importance of balanced production in planning management, its advantages, the harm of unbalanced production, and how to achieve balanced production. The interior of the exhibition was illustrated with examples. For example, when the Third Workshop produced new products, it consumed all the circulating capital due to imbalance, and overtime work also affected the production of the Fifth Workshop. After the visit, worker Zhang Xiuying said: "If our group cannot complete the plan, the next process will wait for materials, which will affect production and cause backlog in the previous process, waste of funds, and great losses! In the future, we must guarantee 100% completion of the plan." In the past, the riveting and forging group of the Seventh Workshop believed that they could produce without rhythmic production and production plans. After visiting the exhibition, they realized the importance of planning management and understood the benefits for themselves.

In order to make the education work in-depth, we also carried out typical education. Each workshop cultivated various types of typical examples in advance, such as Zhang Xihe, an advanced worker in the Second Workshop who consistently implemented the operation plan and balancedly completed the plan, and Xue Yaxian, a statistician who united the masses, adhered to the system, cooperated with the group to balancedly complete the plan, and eliminated the phenomenon of inventory profit and loss. At the same time, we also cultivated typical examples of backward transformation, such as worker Fan Xianqiao from the Second Workshop who reported his transformation, which inspired worker Wang Shixiang to conduct a review.

In the process of repeated and in-depth publicity and education, each workshop classified the workers according to their degree of understanding, and then carried out specific education separately so that everyone could improve their understanding and clarify their practices. This established the ideological foundation for strengthening planning management.

II. Compile and implement operation plans

In the past, when Factory 53 prepared operation plans, the factory, workshop, and work section all calculated the average daily plan based on the total monthly plan and the number of working days. This method did not fully consider the specific circumstances of the implementation of various measures and arrange the corresponding production progress according to this new situation. This, of course, could not effectively guarantee the realization of the production progress. In addition, in the past, the work section operation plan was only proposed by the foreman, and was not fully discussed and revised by the workers, so there was no broad mass base, and the implementation was not guaranteed. In view of the past shortcomings, during the ideological education process, we began to focus on the trial implementation of the preparation and implementation of workshop operation plans.

First, prepare the expected operation plan, that is, prepare a preliminary plan for the next month or quarter in advance, so that major measures in the planning month can be fully prepared to ensure the application of the operation planning month. In May, we prepared the expected operation plan for the third quarter and put forward important requirements for ensuring production progress, and handed it over to the relevant sections to organize the realization and resolution in advance. This prevented the relevant departments from causing production imbalance due to the weak links formed by not seeing the future production improvement.

Then, prepare the operation plan. The production management section, based on the national plan and action plan, and mastering the equipment utilization rate, average quality surplus rate, attendance rate, and expected inventory of work in progress in the month before the planning month, initially arranges the daily production progress of the planning month, and according to this progress and existing conditions (equipment, labor, technology...), proposes requirements for all aspects, and sends them to the relevant sections. The relevant sections, according to the progress requirements, put forward their own guarantees or opinions on revising the plan. After the production section summarizes and sorts out, and if necessary, jointly studies and revises, and after preliminary approval by the factory, it is sent to each workshop. Each workshop studies whether there are new opinions and revision opinions based on this preliminary operation plan, and puts forward measures to adapt to the progress and the workshop. The production section then summarizes and studies to determine it. The workshop prepares the work section operation plan based on this plan, and proposes the key issues of each work section and process. When the work section discusses the operation plan, the production progress and various measures of the relevant sections and workshops are discussed together, and specific measures of the work section are proposed to solve the key problems of the work section. The operation plan is revised from bottom to top after being discussed by the masses, and then revised according to the actual number of work in progress inventory in the previous month at the beginning of the plan month, which is relatively perfect. The schedule for preparing the operation plan is generally stipulated as follows: on the 18th of each month, the production section proposes the production progress and requirements for the next month, on the 20th, each section studies and puts forward opinions to return to the production section, on the 22nd, the production section summarizes and revises and sends it to the workshop, the workshop puts forward opinions before the 25th, the production section revises again and the workshop prepares the work section operation plan, after the 25th, it is submitted to the masses for discussion, revised and determined before the end of the month, and finally revised completely on the 3rd-5th of the next month.

After focusing on the trial implementation, the experience of a work section in the Fifth Workshop in discussing the operation plan was summarized. Their ideological education was well done, the key was found accurately, and the activists were well mobilized. During the discussion, they launched "three searches" (that is, looking for weak links, finding reasons, and finding solutions), and put forward rationalization proposals to solve key problems. At the same time, they put forward vivid slogans such as "check tightness, dig into the roots, and think of ways". In the past, this group was a weak link in the workshop, often failing to keep up with the progress, and sometimes consuming all the circulating capital. After discussing the operation plan, the group clarified the key problems: that is, there was a lot of machine repair time, a lot of repair products, and low labor productivity. The reasons were that the machines were not well maintained, the repair product samples were not uniform, the shift handover system was not sound, and the advanced experience was not well promoted. Then, specific improvement methods were devised, and the production situation quickly changed. Previously, ten machines often failed to complete the task, but now nine machines can still exceed the task to some extent. This experience was introduced to the factory's foremen and trade union group leaders' meeting, and the specific practices of discussing the operation plan were specifically explained to the foremen and trade union group leaders, thereby setting off a "three searches" climax throughout the factory and launching a mass discussion of the operation plan. Within a week, many tricks appeared throughout the factory, and 451 tricks and rationalization proposals have been adopted, 226 of which have been realized, which have concentratedly solved the weak links in production in each workshop and generally improved labor productivity and daily balance rate.

After discussing the operation plan, the instruction charts were then discussed. The charts we formulated mainly include three types: one is the daily production progress (including planned and actual completion) and daily balance rate; one is product quality; and one is the progress of implementing various measures in the operation plan. We organized staff to explain to the workers the meaning of the charts and the methods of filling them out, as well as the role of using the charts to check production, etc. At the same time, we also explained the meaning of various indicators and the methods of completing the indicators. After the workers' discussion, they further improved their economic knowledge, learned to use charts, and became interested in and concerned about the charts.

After discussing the operation plan and instruction charts, in order to ensure the realization of the operation plan, the trade union mobilized the masses of workers throughout the factory to launch a competition around the implementation of the operation plan. In addition to continuing the red flag competition of sub-numbers carried out among direct production workers in the past, this time, the red flag competition of sub-numbers was also carried out among auxiliary personnel, which played a certain role. For example, after the Second Workshop launched the red flag competition of sub-numbers in the transportation group, it eliminated overturning accidents, reduced the phenomenon of crushing products, and strengthened contact with all aspects, which played a due role in balanced production.

III. Improve the responsibility system

The implementation of the operation plan must also have a sound production responsibility system. Although we basically had a series of production responsibility systems in the past, they were not sound enough (especially the production scheduling responsibility system), and some of them were also reduced to formalities in the implementation. In view of the problems existing in the past, we decided to first improve the main responsibility systems, such as the production scheduling responsibility system, the equipment maintenance responsibility system, the tool supply responsibility system, the technical security responsibility system, and the shift handover system, etc., and then improve or consolidate other systems in turn.

The improvement of the production scheduling responsibility system started with the improvement of the organization. The number of people in the original production management section's scheduling group and workshop schedulers was increased, the scope of responsibilities was clarified in the planning and scheduling group, and auxiliary workshop schedulers were also determined. This ensured the centralized and unified scheduling work of the factory and achieved flexible and timely scheduling work; at the same time, the factory and workshop production scheduling responsibility system was revised according to the requirements of the scheduling work, and relevant personnel were organized to study and implement it.

The equipment maintenance responsibility system mainly learns from the Soviet engineer Tsilminch's regional responsibility system for equipment maintenance. First, the key trial implementation was carried out in the Second Workshop's process with a lot of machine repair time and low equipment utilization rate. Machine repair personnel and veteran production workers were equipped to form a maintenance team, and timely oiling, wiping, and adjustment of machine parts were carried out for daily maintenance work, thereby overcoming small problems that occur daily and gradually achieving fewer or no problems. At the same time, the history cards of each machine (that is, the repair records of each time) were reorganized and improved; thereby determining which parts should be repaired or replaced when, so as to prepare spare parts in advance (old parts were also repaired for backup), and repairs were carried out in the third shift or on Sundays without affecting production. This overcame the phenomenon that the machine was suddenly damaged due to the loss of timely maintenance and could not quickly resume production. In early June, the group improved the quality by 0.01%, the equipment utilization rate increased by 9.79%, and the production cycle was shortened by 0.42 days, reaching a daily balance rate of over 99%.

To strengthen the tool supply responsibility system, on the one hand, strengthen the tool section's measures for tool supply. The most important thing is to improve the tool quality and ensure accuracy and durability (strengthening machine maintenance also saves tools). At the same time, issue tool saving indicators to each workshop, requiring each workshop to formulate measures to save tools. The tool section establishes a tool library based on this and supplies tools to the workshop tool personnel according to the production and tool consumption quota. If temporary problems are encountered, emergency measures are taken to solve them; on the other hand, daily-used tools (such as wrenches, etc.) are reasonably equipped (how many for each person, how many for several people to use together, add if not enough), and fixed placement locations and handover responsibility systems are determined to overcome the phenomenon of wasting production time due to tool loss, damage, and searching for tools in the past. In addition to continuing to deeply educate on the original system and strengthening the security duty system, the technical security responsibility system is further consolidated by promoting safe operation qualification certificates.

IV. Improve original record work

The preparation and implementation of the operation plan are based on correct and timely statistical work. The correctness and timeliness of statistical data are based on the correctness and timeliness of grassroots statistics (original records). Therefore, improving grassroots statistics is always necessary while strengthening planning management.

We inspected the grassroots statistical work in the past. Due to the lack of attention to statistical work by leaders at all levels; frequent turnover of grassroots statistical personnel, unfamiliarity with the business, and lack of responsibility; inaccurate measuring tools; and insufficient implementation of statistical systems, the inventory profit and loss were relatively large, losing authenticity, and individual false reports of figures. Although leaders at all levels had long felt that the problem was serious, they did not make up their minds to improve it. In view of the above situation, we first organized cadres to study relevant documents to improve their ideological understanding, thereby starting to further attach importance to statistical work. At the same time, the statistical organization was strengthened. Full-time statisticians were added to the main sections of the factory, and one to two full-time statisticians were also set up in the workshops. Statisticians were fixed in the work sections. At the same time, it was stipulated that the statistical personnel must solicit the consent of the superior statistical agency (that is, the statistical group of the planning section and the planning department of the bureau), and only after training reserve personnel in advance can they be transferred. Again, the factory-wide statistical meeting (statisticians, foremen) and the short-term training class for statisticians and foremen were held to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the past statistical work to clarify the direction of future efforts, and in advance, the advanced thinking and advanced working methods of more advanced statisticians were summarized as typical reports to expand ideological and work comparison, vigorously promote and launch a competition to do a good job in statistical work. Each workshop can also regularly check this work. Statisticians and foremen mutually expose the shortcomings in the work and determine future practices, so the statistical work is more correct and timely than before, and the errors are greatly reduced. The statisticians' sense of responsibility has also been strengthened.

V. Improve departmental work and strengthen auxiliary workshops

Improving departmental work plays a very important role in planning management. In the past, due to the fact that departmental work could not keep up with the requirements of production, the preparation work, technical management, and tool supply were not well done, which had a great impact on balanced production. In order to improve the departmental work, we first talked with the party members in the departments (more than 20 people successively) to understand the situation and learned that the vast majority of the cadres in the departments wanted to do a good job, mainly because the factory administrative leaders gave fewer methods and fewer policies; they gave more tasks and more criticism, and there was a bureaucratic style; in addition, the political work in the departments was relatively weak. Based on this, we formulated a plan to strengthen departmental work, starting with improving the leadership first. After discussion by the Standing Committee of the Party Committee, we first conducted internal party and then external party mobilization. The leaders conducted reviews and explained the importance and methods of improving departmental work. Then, we carried out self-examination in the departments and gave opinions to the leaders, and established improvement methods at all levels. Secondly, according to the opinions of the departments, we resumed the weekly specific business discussions (one of which was the factory affairs meeting) to enable the departments to contact each other to solve some major problems; we also did a good job of determining the work focus for each department separately every quarter, so that the departments could make full preparations for the central work and specific work early. The monthly work plans of each department were submitted to the administration for detailed review and approval, which ensured that the work of each department was closely linked to the center and closely related to each other, and initially avoided uncoordinated phenomena. In order to help the weak departments, we also determined to divide the work for specific assistance. Party and mass organizations divided the work to go deep into the departments to mobilize and help the party members, league members, activists, and trade union members in the departments, closely grasp the work plan of the department, go deep into the workshop, and carry out the red flag competition of sub-numbers to do a good job in the current planning management work.

During this period of strengthening planning management, the departmental work has been improved in several ways. For example, when preparing the operation plan, the relevant departments formulated measures adapted to the progress, again compressed the turnover of work in progress, and shortened the production cycle; the scheduling group of the production management section went deep into the workshop to do a good job of the instruction charts, thereby strengthening the scheduling work; the material section and the accounting section handled 3.2 billion yuan worth of stagnant materials; the efficiency group of the labor and salary section and the power machinery section and the tool section improved the rhythmic production of tools and machine repair workshops. After carefully summarizing the above advanced work experience, organizing typical reports to exchange experience, carrying out ideological and work comparison, and vigorously promoting these experiences, the work plans of each department have been fully completed in June. Now we continue to promote advanced work experience and deeply cultivate typical examples to further improve the departmental work and strengthen planning management.

Auxiliary workshops were also a weak link in the past work, which had a great impact on balanced production. The method we used to make operation plans in auxiliary workshops was roughly the same as in other workshops, but we paid more attention to the characteristics of auxiliary workshops (tasks were not very fixed, and the work foundation was poor), gave more help, and strengthened leadership. On the one hand, we overcame the idea of the leading cadres and workers in auxiliary workshops that they lacked the idea of doing a good job in operation plans because the tasks were not fixed; at the same time, we paid attention to improving the preparation work for balanced production, unifying and fixing drawings, paying attention to the correctness and timeliness of drawings, gradually establishing a parts and spare parts warehouse, and doing a good job in maintenance work. In order to implement rhythmic production, we have begun to classify them by type to move towards specialized production.

After the above series of work, we have a more specific understanding of the importance of planning management and have begun to grasp the law of operation planning. However, all of these works are only the beginning, and there are still many serious shortcomings in the work, such as quality fluctuations, lax technical management, and insufficient implementation of the safe production policy, and the preparation and implementation of the operation plan are still not very coordinated. These shortcomings show that our leadership level cannot adapt to the production work. Therefore, we must continue to work hard to further strengthen planning management and improve the leadership level.

    五三工厂怎样加强计划管理工作
    五三工厂厂长  高方启
    五三工厂在加强计划管理工作中，由于抓住了搞好作业计划这一主要环节，同时整顿了原始记录，加强了调度工作，健全了责任制度，改进与提高了科室工作，因而进一步提高了生产均衡率，保证提前完成了上半年国家计划。六月份五三工厂主要产品的均衡率已达到百分之九十七点三九，较五月份提高百分之零点三四，五月份劳动生产率比计划提高百分之二十二点九五。我们以作业计划为中心加强计划管理的过程大致是这样：
    一、向职工进行深入的宣传教育，树立计划管理的思想基础。
    在认真学习了有关加强计划管理的指示和材料后，我们根据全厂当前情况制订了全面加强计划管理的工作计划。首先向职工讲解计划管理的内容及重要性，并组织讨论。同时组织全厂宣传力量展开工作，使职工一般地认识到计划管理的重要性及主要作法。
    当然，这些工作还不能全部解除工人的顾虑，彻底澄清错误思想。在检查中发现，有的工人特别是辅助工人认为加强计划管理与己无关；有的认为均衡生产是不准超额；有的认为生产任务不固定没法均衡。
    针对以上情况，我们又确定进一步用通俗易懂的宣传形式结合车间实际情况展开宣传工作。如通过计划管理展览会，把均衡生产在计划管理中的重要意义及其优越性、均衡生产的好处、不均衡生产的危害、如何均衡生产等分别进行讲解。展览会内部都以实例说明，如三车间生产新产品时由于不均衡，把周转量吃光了，加班加点还影响了五车间生产。参观后工人张秀英说：“本组不能完成计划，下道待料，影响生产，上道积压，浪费资金，损失该多么大！今后要保证百分之百完成计划。”七车间铆锻组工人过去认为没有节奏生产和生产计划也能生产，参观展览会后，认识了计划管理的重要，也懂得了对自己的好处。
    为了使教育工作深入，我们还进行了典型教育。各车间都在事先作了各类典型培养，如二车间培养了一贯执行作业计划均衡完成计划的先进人物张喜贺，和团结群众、坚持制度、配合小组均衡完成计划、消灭在制品盈亏现象的统计员薛雅贤。同时也培养了落后转变的典型，如二车间工人范先乔报告他的转变后，启发了工人王士祥进行了检讨。
    在反复深入地进行宣传教育过程中，各车间根据职工认识的程度逐次进行了分类，然后再具体地分别进行教育，使大家都能提高认识，明确做法。这就建立了加强计划管理的思想基础。
    二、编制与贯彻作业计划
    五三工厂过去编制作业计划时，厂、车间及工段都是以月计划总数按工作日数平均计算为日计划。这种办法，没有充分考虑到各项措施实行中的具体情况，并根据这种新情况而排出相适应的生产进度。这当然就不能有效地保证生产进度的实现。另外，过去工段作业计划只由工长提些意见，没有交工人充分讨论和修订，因而没有广泛的群众基础，结果贯彻也无保证。针对过去缺点，在进行思想教育的过程中，即开始进行车间作业计划编制和贯彻的重点试办工作。
    先编制预计作业计划，即提前编制下月或下季的初步计划，以便使计划月中的较大措施得以充分准备，保证作业计划月的运用。我们在五月份编制了第三季度预计作业计划，并提出保证生产进度的重要要求，一并交有关科事先组织实现与解决。这就使各有关部门不致因看不到今后生产提高而形成的薄弱环节，造成生产的不均衡。
    接着编制作业计划，由生产管理科根据国家计划与行动计划，并掌握计划月前一月的设备利用率、质量平均超额率、出勤率以及在制品预计盘存等资料，初步排出计划月的日生产进度，并根据这一进度和现有条件（设备、劳动力、技术……）对照，提出对各方面的要求，发到有关科室，有关科室根据进度要求，提出自己的保证或修正计划的意见。经过生产科汇总整理，必要时共同研究修正，经厂部初步批准后发至各车间。各车间根据这一初步作业计划研究有无新的意见和修正意见，并提出适应进度及本车间进行的措施，再由生产科汇总研究确定下来。车间就根据这个计划编制工段作业计划，并提出各工段和工序的关键问题。工段讨论作业计划时，将生产进度及有关科和车间各项措施一并加以讨论提出意见，并提出本工段的各项具体措施以解决工段关键问题。作业计划经群众讨论后，自下而上进行修订，到计划月初再根据上月在制品库存实际数加以修正，这就比较完善。编制作业计划的日程，一般规定为每月十八日生产科提出下月生产进度与要求，二十日各科研究提出意见返回生产科，二十二日生产科汇总修正发至车间，车间二十五日前提出意见，生产科再度修正并由车间编制好工段作业计划，二十五日后交群众讨论，月底前修正完和确定下来，到下月三日——五日最后修正完。
    经过重点试办，总结了五车间一个工段讨论作业计划的经验，他们的思想教育做得好，关键找得准，积极分子发动得好，在讨论时展开了“三找”（即找薄弱环节、找原因、找办法），提合理化建议解决关键问题，同时提出了“查松紧，挖根源，想办法”等生动口号。该组在过去是车间的薄弱环节，经常赶不上进度，有时把周转量吃光，经过讨论作业计划，该组明确了关键问题：即机修时间多、修品多、劳动生产率低，其原因是机器保养不好，修品样板不统一，交接班制度不健全，先进经验推广得不好。接着想出具体改进办法，使生产情况很快转变过来。以前十台机器常完不成任务，现在九台还可多少超过任务。将这一经验在全厂工长及工会组长会上介绍，并具体的向工长及工会组长交代讨论作业计划的具体作法，从而全厂掀起了“三找”高潮，展开了群众性的讨论作业计划。在一周内全厂出现了许多窍门，已被采纳的窍门和合理化建议四百五十一条，已实现二百二十六条，集中地解决了各车间生产上的薄弱环节，普遍地提高了劳动生产率与日均衡率。
    讨论完作业计划后，接着就讨论指示图表。我们制订的图表主要是三个：一为日生产进度（包括计划与实际完成）及日均衡率；一为产品质量；一为实现作业计划中各项措施进度。组织了职员向工人讲解图表意义和填写方法以及运用图表检查生产的作用等，同时也讲解了各项指标的意义与完成指标的方法。经过工人讨论进一步提高了经济知识，学会了运用图表，同时对图表发生了兴趣和关心。
    在讨论作业计划和指示图表后，为了保证作业计划的实现，围绕贯彻作业计划，工会发动全厂职工群众展开了竞赛。除坚持过去在直接生产工人中开展的分号红旗竞赛外，这次在辅助人员中也开展了分号红旗竞赛，起到了一定的作用。如二车间在运输组开展了分号红旗竞赛后，消灭了翻车事故，减少了压坏产品的现象，并且加强了与各方面的联系，对均衡生产起到了应有的作用。
    三、健全责任制
    作业计划的贯彻还必须有健全的生产责任制度。我们过去虽基本上有了一系列的生产责任制度，但都不够健全（尤其是生产调度责任制），在执行中有的也流于形式。针对过去存在的问题，我们确定首先健全主要的责任制，如生产调度责任制，设备保养检修责任制，工具供应责任制，技术保安责任制以及交接班制度等，其他制度再依次改进或加以巩固。
    生产调度责任制的健全，是从健全组织作起的。增加了原生产管理科调度组的人员、车间调度员，在计划调度组内更明确了职责范围，同时也确定了辅助车间调度员。这就保证了全厂调度工作的集中统一，做到了调度工作的灵活及时；同时根据调度工作的要求修订了全厂与车间生产调度责任制，并组织了有关人员学习和贯彻。
    设备保养检修责任制，主要是学习苏联齐尔民赫工程师的设备保养检修区域负责制。首先在二车间机修时间多设备利用率低的工序重点试办，配备了机修人员与生产老工人组织包修小组，对日常保养工作做到及时浇油擦洗和调整机件，从而克服了日常发生的小问题并逐渐达到少发生或不发生问题。同时从新整顿并健全了每个机器履历卡片（即历次检修记录）；从而确定哪些零件何时检修或新换，以便提前做好备件工作（旧件也修好备用），在第三班或星期日进行检修而不影响生产，这样克服了因失去适时检修而突然发生的机器损坏而不能迅速恢复生产的现象。该组在六月上旬做到质量提高百分之零点零一，设备利用率提高百分之九点七九，生产周期缩短零点四二天而达到了日均衡率百分之九十九以上。
    加强工具供应责任制，一方面是加强工具科对工具供应的措施，最重要的是提高工具质量，保证精度和耐用程度（加强机器保养检修也节省工具），同时对各车间颁发节省工具指标，要求各车间制订措施作到节省工具，工具科以此建立工具库与车间工具员按生产和工具消耗定额供应工具的制度，如遇临时问题就采取紧急办法解决；另一方面是将日常用的工具（如搬手等）合理配备（每人各多少，几人合用多少，不够的增添），并确定固定置放地点以及交接责任制度，克服了过去那种因工具遗失、损坏以及寻找工具而浪费生产时间的现象。技术保安责任制除继续以原有制度深入教育和加强保安值班制外，更以推广安全操作合格证来巩固这一制度的贯彻。
     四、改善原始记录工作
    作业计划的编制与贯彻都以正确及时的统计工作为基础。而统计资料的正确及时又基于基层统计（原始记录）的正确及时，因此在加强计划管理的同时，改进基层统计乃是经常必要的。
    我们检查了过去基层统计工作，由于各级领导对统计工作的重视不够；基层统计人员调动较频繁、业务不熟、责任心不够强；量具不准确；贯彻统计制度不够等，造成了盘存盈亏较大，失去真实性，以及个别假报数字等。各级领导干部虽早已感到问题严重，但没有下决心改进。针对以上情况，首先组织了干部学习有关文件，提高了干部思想认识，从而开始进一步重视了统计工作。同时，加强了统计组织。在厂的主要科室增设了专职统计员，在车间也设有一至二个专职统计员，对工段则固定了统计员，同时规定统计人员必须征请上级统计机构（即计划科统计组与局计划处）的同意，又在事先培养了后备人员时方能调动。再次，召开全厂统计会议（统计员、工长）及统计员、工长短期训练班，总结了过去统计工作的优缺点，以明确今后努力方向，并事先总结较先进统计员的先进思想和先进工作方法作典型报告，展开思想和工作对照，大力推广并展开搞好统计工作的竞赛。各车间也能经常检查这一工作。统计员和工长则互相揭发工作上的缺点并确定今后做法，因此统计工作比前较正确及时，错误大大减少了。统计员责任心也加强了。
    五、改善科室工作，加强辅助车间
    改善科室工作在计划管理当中占着很重要的地位。过去由于科室工作赶不上生产的要求，生产和准备工作、技术管理、工具的供应做得不好，对均衡生产影响很大。为了改善科室工作，我们首先找科室内的党员（先后二十多人）谈话了解情况，了解到科室干部绝大多数是想把工作作好，主要是厂行政领导方面交办法少，交政策少；交任务多，批评多，存在官僚主义作风；另外科室政治工作比较薄弱。据此，制订了以首先改进领导着手的加强科室工作计划，经党委常委会讨论后，先党内后党外进行传达动员，领导进行检讨，并讲明改进科室工作的重要性及做法。随即开展科室自我检查，并给领导提意见，层层订立改进办法。其次，按科室意见恢复了每周具体业务讨论（其中一周为厂务会）以便使各科室相互联系解决一些主要问题；也做到了每季对各科室分别确定工作要点，使科室围绕中心工作及具体工作早作充分准备，每月各科室工作计划，交由行政详细审查批准，这就做到了各科室工作密切结合中心，而又相互紧密联系，初步避免了不协调现象。为了使薄弱的科室得到帮助，又确定分工进行具体帮助。党群组织分工深入科室发动与帮助科室党团员积极分子、工会会员，紧紧掌握本科室工作计划深入车间，并开展分号红旗竞赛以搞好当前计划管理工作。
    在这一段加强计划管理工作中，科室工作已有若干改进。如在编制作业计划时各有关科都制订了和进度相适应的措施，再次压缩在制品周转量、缩短生产周期等；生产管理科调度组深入车间搞好指示图表，因而加强了调度工作；材料科和会计科处理了价值三十二亿元的呆滞材料；劳动工薪科效率组与动力机械科、工具科改进了工具和机修车间节奏生产。经过认真总结以上先进工作经验，组织典型报告交流经验，开展了思想和工作对照，大力推广这些经验，因而六月份各科工作计划已全部完成。现在继续以推广先进工作经验和深入培养典型，达到进一步改善科室工作加强计划管理的目的。
    辅助车间也是过去工作中较薄弱的一环，对均衡生产也有很大影响。我们在辅助车间搞作业计划的方法和其它车间大致相同，不过更特别注意根据辅助车间的特点（任务不甚固定，工作基础较差），多加帮助并加强领导。一方面克服辅助车间领导干部和工人因任务不固定而缺乏搞好作业计划的思想；同时注意改进了均衡生产准备工作，统一与固定图纸，注意图纸的正确与及时，逐步建立机件备品库，做好检修工作。并为实行节奏生产，已开始分型分类，使之走向专业化生产。
    经过上述一系列的工作，我们已较具体地认识了计划管理的重要性，并开始掌握了作业计划的规律。但是所有这些工作也还仅仅是开始，工作中也还存在许多严重的缺点，例如质量的波动，技术管理的松懈，执行安全生产方针的不够，作业计划的编制与贯彻仍还不十分协调等等。这些缺点说明我们的领导水平还不能与生产工作适应，因此，还须继续努力，进一步加强计划管理，以提高领导水平。
