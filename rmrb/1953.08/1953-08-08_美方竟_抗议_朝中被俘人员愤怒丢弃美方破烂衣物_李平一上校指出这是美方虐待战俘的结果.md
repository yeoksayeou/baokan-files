Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 7th: North Korean and Chinese captured personnel who returned to our side's exchange area on the 6th continued to angrily discard the tattered clothing that symbolized the U.S. POW camp's mistreatment and persecution of our captured personnel. The rotten clothes and moldy rice thrown from the trucks sometimes landed next to or on the American officers by the trucks. Colonel Edwards, the American member of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee, actually lodged a "protest" with our side's committee member regarding this.

    Our side's committee member, Colonel Li Pingyi, immediately pointed out that this angry mood of our captured personnel was caused by the inhumane treatment they received in the enemy's POW camps. As the other side has seen, our staff did their best to maintain order during the exchange.

    Anyone who has witnessed the hatred and anger of our returning personnel towards the U.S. side in our exchange area will feel that it is precisely the U.S. side's long-term mistreatment and persecution of our captured personnel, its attempts to forcibly detain them, and even its continued persecution of them after the signing of the armistice agreement and during repatriation, that has caused them to have such deep hatred for the enemy. Now that they are able to return to the embrace of their motherland, they are therefore discarding things that bear the marks of U.S. mistreatment with extreme anger: military rags with "PW" written on them, broken leather boots, crushed military water bottles, and foul-smelling rice balls made of barley and broad beans. This is perfectly natural. Seeing them throw away everything from the U.S. side, wearing only shorts, but properly wearing the military caps of their motherland that they made at the risk of their lives in the POW camps, holding tightly the Zhonghua brand cigarettes presented by the North Korean and Chinese Red Cross, singing loudly, and cheering to their hearts' content, people will deeply appreciate how much they yearn for their motherland and hate the enemy.

    美方竟“抗议”朝中被俘人员愤怒丢弃美方破烂衣物
    李平一上校指出这是美方虐待战俘的结果
   【新华社开城七日电】六日回到我方交接区的朝中被俘人员，继续愤怒地丢弃标志着美方战俘营虐待与迫害我方被俘人员的破烂衣物。自卡车上扔下的烂衣霉饭，有的落在车旁美国军官的身旁或身上。战俘遣返委员会美方委员艾德瓦兹上校竟就此向我方委员提出“抗议”。
    我方委员李平一上校当即指出，我方被俘人员的这种愤怒情绪，是对方战俘营所给予他们的非人道待遇造成的。正如对方所看到的，在交接时我方工作人员曾尽最大努力维持秩序。
    凡是曾在我方交接区目睹了我方归来人员对美方的仇恨和愤怒情绪的人都会感觉到：正是美方对我方被俘人员的长期虐待和迫害、企图强迫扣留他们，甚至在停战协定签字以后和遣返途中还百般迫害他们，才造成了他们对敌人如此深切的仇恨，他们能够重回祖国怀抱了，因此他们带着极端愤怒的情绪丢弃那带着美方虐待的痕迹的东西：写着“PW”的破军衣、破皮靴、压瘪了的军用水壶、用大麦、蚕豆做的发臭了的饭团等。这是十分自然的。看到他们丢掉美方的一切东西，仅穿着一条短裤，但却端正地戴着他们在战俘营里冒着生命危险而制成的祖国的军帽，手里紧紧地拿着朝中红十字会赠送的中华牌香烟，引吭高歌，尽情欢呼，人们就会深深体会到他们是多么渴念祖国、仇恨敌人。
