    Provinces in Southern China Experiencing Drought Receive Successive Rainfall; Farmers Rush to Plant in an Effort to Increase Production

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangdong in the south, which have been experiencing drought, have successively received rainfall in mid-August. Farmers are rushing to plant in an effort to increase grain production in the autumn.

    After experiencing a prolonged drought, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces received rainfall on August 16th and 18th, respectively, which has alleviated the drought situation. The rain in these two provinces was brought by typhoons. The northern part of Fujian Province and the southern part of Zhejiang Province received heavier rainfall. The rainfall in Nanping, Shuikou, and Fuzhou in Fujian Province ranged from 24 mm to 60 mm. The rainfall in Hangzhou and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province ranged from 17 mm to 60 mm. The rainfall in Wenzhou, Qingtian, Lishui, and other places in the province reached over 80 mm. The areas in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces that were previously unable to transplant late rice seedlings due to lack of rain will rush to plant after the rain.

    Jiangxi Province also experienced widespread rainfall on the 17th and 18th, basically relieving the drought situation throughout the province. According to reports from hydrological stations in various parts of Jiangxi Province, the average rainfall in the province was over 100 mm. The area with the heaviest rainfall in the northeast of the province reached over 200 mm. The severely drought-stricken counties of Ji'an, Anfu, Xinyu, and Yichun also received rainfall of over 60 mm to 100 mm. The late rice, cotton, and other crops in Jiangxi's rural areas that urgently need irrigation, as well as the late autumn crops that are being sown, will greatly benefit from this timely and sufficient rainfall. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Government issued instructions on the 17th, instructing all localities to immediately repair water conservancy projects, pay attention to water storage, and promptly carry out replanting in the drought-affected areas.

    After Guangdong Province received widespread rainfall of 20 mm to 30 mm on August 13th and 14th, farmers in areas where summer planting had been affected by the drought were rushing to plant. It is estimated that the western Guangdong area, where the drought situation is more severe, will complete rice transplanting within days. After receiving rainfall, 108 townships in Suixi County have completed replanting. More than 300,000 mu of drought-stricken fields in Xuwen and Haikang counties can also be transplanted with rice seedlings.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 18th] After making every effort to combat drought and protect the autumn harvest, the drought-stricken areas of Fujian Province have now planted summer crops in a timely manner, and the rice fields have water for irrigation. By August 10th, more than 2 million mu of paddy fields in the Jinjiang and Longxi special districts in southern Fujian (accounting for about 80% of the double-cropping rice fields in the above-mentioned areas) had been irrigated in a timely manner after the early rice harvest, and late rice seedlings had been transplanted. Most of the double-cropping rice fields in the Minhou special district in eastern Fujian have also been transplanted with late rice seedlings. The paddy fields that have not been transplanted are also being irrigated in preparation for transplanting or replanting other crops. Most of the 300,000 mu of single-season mid-rice and late rice fields in the drought-stricken Jinjiang special district, the double-cropping late rice fields, single-season mid-rice fields, and late rice fields in the Minhou special district, and the more than 165,000 mu of drought-stricken single-season mid-rice fields and late rice fields in the Jianyang special district in northern Fujian have been irrigated. The rice is generally growing well, and some early-maturing single-season mid-rice has begun to head. The rice production of the Jinjiang, Longxi, Minhou, and Jianyang special districts has historically accounted for more than 70% of the province's total rice production. The continuous victories in combating drought and protecting the autumn harvest in various places are of great significance in ensuring that the province's autumn grain crop avoids or reduces losses.

    In this struggle against drought and for the protection of the autumn harvest in Fujian Province, party and government leading organs at all levels have dispatched responsible cadres and a large number of staff members to go deep into the villages and fields to lead the farmers in fighting the drought. The Fujian Provincial People's Government has allocated 10 billion yuan to help farmers in various places rush to repair water conservancy facilities and has lent a batch of water pumps to help farmers divert water to irrigate their fields. The farmers in various places are also more actively combating drought and protecting the autumn harvest, paying attention to improving farming techniques, stepping up mid-cultivation and weeding, increasing fertilizer application, and preventing and controlling pests, doing their best to increase grain production.

    南方呈现旱象的各省先后降雨
    农民突击抢种争取增产
    据新华社讯：南方呈旱象的福建、浙江、江西、广东各省在八月中旬已先后降雨，农民突击抢种，努力争取秋季粮食增产。
    久旱不雨的福建、浙江两省，在八月十六日、十八日降雨之后，旱象已趋缓和。这两省的雨，是由台风带来的。福建省的北部、浙江省的南部地区雨量较大。福建省的南平、水口、福州降雨量在二十四公厘到六十公厘。浙江省的杭州、宁波降雨量在十七公厘到六十公厘；该省的温州、青田、丽水等地降雨量达到八十公厘以上。福建、浙江两省原来缺雨未能插晚稻秧的地区，将在雨后突击抢种。
    江西省各地十七、十八两日也普遍降雨，基本上解除了全省的旱象。据江西省各地水文站报告该省降雨量的情形说：全省平均在一百公厘以上。该省东北部降雨量最大地区达二百公厘以上。旱情严重的吉安、安福、新喻、宜春等县也都降雨六十公厘到一百公厘以上。江西农村目前亟需灌溉的晚稻、棉花等作物，以及正在播种的晚秋作物，得到这次及时和充足的雨水后，极为有益。江西省人民政府特于十七日指示各地立即修整水利工程，注意蓄水储水，并在原来受旱地区及时进行抢种。
    广东省八月十三、十四两日普遍降雨二十公厘到三十公厘之后，原来因旱情影响未能夏种的地区，农民们都在抢种。旱情较严重的粤西区估计日内即可完成插秧。遂溪县得雨水后，有一百零八个乡已抢种完毕。徐闻、海康两县的三十多万亩受旱田也都能插秧。
    【新华社福州十八日电】    福建省受旱地区经过全力抗旱保秋，目前，夏季作物已适时播种，水稻田都有水灌溉。到八月十日止，福建南部的晋江、龙溪两专区已有二百多万亩水田（占上述地区双季连作稻田百分之八十左右），在早稻收割后，适时灌了水，插上晚稻秧苗。福建东部的闽侯专区大部分双季连作稻田，也都插了晚稻秧苗。部分没有插秧的水田，也正在灌水，准备插秧或改种其他作物。晋江专区受旱的三十万亩单季中稻田和晚稻田，闽侯专区双季间作晚稻田、单季中稻田、晚稻田，以及福建北部建阳专区有十六万五千多亩受旱的单季中稻田、晚稻田，大都得到了灌溉，稻子一般生长良好，有些早熟的单季中稻已开始孕穗。晋江、龙溪、闽侯、建阳四个专区稻谷产量历年来占全省稻谷总产量百分之七十以上，各地抗旱保秋的不断胜利，对保证全省秋粮避免或减轻损失有重大意义。
    福建省这次抗旱保秋斗争中，各地党、政领导机关都派出负责干部和大批工作人员深入乡村和田间，领导农民和旱灾作斗争。福建省人民政府特拨款一百亿元，帮助各地农民赶修水利，并借出一批抽水机帮助农民引水灌田。各地农民抗旱保秋也就更加积极，都注意改进耕作技术、加紧中耕锄草，增施肥料和防治害虫，尽力争取粮食增产。
