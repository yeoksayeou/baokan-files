Cadres in the Fifth District of Hongshan County, Hubei Province,
Force the Masses to Destroy Dryland Crops and Transplant Rice Seedlings

Hongshan County is one of the counties in Hubei Province that suffered severely from drought this year. On May 29th, the county experienced widespread rainfall. On June 3rd, the Hongshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an emergency directive, calling for the utilization of all water sources to plant rice seedlings in as many paddy fields as possible; those truly unsuitable for planting rice should be converted to dryland crops. This arrangement was correct. However, the directive subjectively allocated the number of rice seedlings to be planted in each district, for example, requiring the Fifth District to complete 70 percent of the rice seedling planting area. After receiving the directive, the district cadres of the Fifth District, without considering the actual conditions of the district, convened a meeting of the District Committee and work team leaders, focusing solely on how to complete the tasks assigned by the higher authorities. They devised many methods, but the existing water sources were only sufficient for 849 mu of farmland, far short of the number required by the higher authorities. At that time, the actual situation in the district was that many people, seeing the drought situation worsening, had already converted many paddy fields to dryland crops.

The district and township cadres of the Fifth District, unable to come up with ways to increase water sources, disregarded the actual situation and insisted on demanding that the masses destroy the dryland crop seedlings in the paddy fields and transplant rice seedlings. They also assigned tasks to the townships, requiring them to engage in challenge competitions. The district and township cadres also went deep into the peasant households to "mobilize." This caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Yu Banghua, a farmer from Xuejia Township, said: "If the government guarantees that my family will not starve to death, I will convert to planting rice seedlings." Party member Fang Lianggui, in order to take the lead in transplanting rice seedlings, caused disharmony in his family. Some township cadres even threatened the peasants, saying: "If you don't convert, you will still have to pay rice during the autumn grain requisition." When Sanhe Township mobilized Yang Zhiqing to convert to planting rice seedlings, Yang disagreed, and the township cadres said: "Who are you being controlled by? Tell us, and we will definitely deduct from you." Finally, the work team and township cadres personally carried plows, led cattle, and carried waterwheels to plow the land and draw water for Yang, converting the dryland crops to rice seedlings.

On June 8th, the county committee discovered this situation and ordered Zhang Deying, the secretary of the District Committee, to personally go down to investigate. Currently, the leading cadres of the district have submitted written self-criticisms, and the work teams and township cadres, in addition to making self-criticisms, have also apologized to the masses.

    湖北洪山县第五区干部
    强迫群众毁坏旱作物改插秧苗
    洪山县是湖北省今年旱灾严重的一个县，五月二十九日，该县普遍落了雨，中共洪山县委于六月三日发出紧急指示，号召利用一切水源，尽量将可能插秧的水田都插上；实在不能插的，改种旱作物。这样的布置是对的。但在指示中却主观的分配各区插秧的数目字，例如要求第五区完成百分之七十的插秧面积。第五区区干部接到指示后，也不根据本区实际情况，就召开区委及工作组长会议，单纯的研究如何完成上级分配的任务。他们想了很多办法，但现有水源仍只够八百四十九亩田用水，离上级要求的数字还很远。而当时这个区的实际情况是，许多群众见旱情日益严重，已把很多秧田改种了旱田作物。
    第五区的区乡干部既想不出增加水源的办法，又不顾实际情况，却一味要求群众毁去水田中的旱作物苗子，改插稻秧，并向各乡布置了任务，要他们挑战竞赛。区乡干部还深入到农户中去“动员”。这事引起了群众很大的不满。薛家乡农民余邦华说：“政府保证我一家不饿死，我就改插秧苗。”党员方良贵为带头插秧，闹得家庭不团结。有的乡干部甚至威胁农民说：“你不改，到秋征时还要拿稻谷。”三合乡动员杨志卿改插秧苗，杨不同意，乡干部说：“你是被谁掌握的，你说出来，非扣你不行。”最后工作组和乡的干部亲扛着犁、牵着牛、抬着水车，给杨耕地车水，将旱作物改插了秧苗。
    六月八日该县县委会发现这一情况后，责成该区区委书记张德英亲自下去检查。现该区领导干部已进行书面检讨，工作组、乡干部除了检讨外，并向群众道歉。（刘鸣冈）
