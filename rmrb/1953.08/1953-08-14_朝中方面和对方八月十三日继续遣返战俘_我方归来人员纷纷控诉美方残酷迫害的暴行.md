Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 13th: On August 13th, our side repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war and 250 Korean prisoners of war to the other side, totaling 400. Among the non-Korean prisoners of war were 75 American citizens and 75 British citizens.

The other side repatriated 2,160 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army (including 360 wounded and sick personnel) and 222 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers to our side.

Three of our captured personnel who returned today were stabbed in the head and arms by U.S. soldiers with bayonets at Busan Railway Station on the 12th. Three others were injured by U.S. soldiers using wooden sticks and iron bars. After getting off the train, they immediately filed a complaint with the Joint Red Cross team. The three stabbed individuals were accompanied by personnel from both sides of the Joint Red Cross team to the Red Cross first-aid station to examine their injuries, which proved to be stab wounds. This matter will be brought up for discussion at the coordinating group meeting of the Joint Red Cross team.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 12th: Today, the U.S. side dispatched more military police than in the past to repatriate our captured personnel. In the second batch of fourteen repatriation vehicles this morning, five vehicles were carrying U.S. military police and other military personnel. Obviously, this was to monitor the actions of our captured personnel during repatriation.

However, our captured personnel, filled with anger, still hatefully threw away the clothes, broken leather shoes, and moldy rice balls given to them by the U.S. side. Along the way, they waved the national flags they had sewn themselves, tied to their crutches. After the repatriation vehicles arrived in our exchange zone, they excitedly cheered, sang, and shouted slogans. Park Myung-soo, a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army, also brought a petition sewn from shirt scraps. This petition described the various crimes of abuse and persecution of prisoners of war committed by the U.S. side in the Geojedo No. 13 prisoner-of-war camp, and contained the signatures of 479 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army in this prisoner-of-war camp.

Among the captured personnel who returned today, there were many heartbreaking and indignant cripples. A captured soldier of the Korean People's Army named Li Yongjun had a large scar on his face, which completely disfigured his appearance. He had large scars on his chest and back. Li Yongjun said that because he insisted on returning to his motherland during the U.S. side's forced "screening," the "doctor" in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, under the pretext of treating the wound on his face, cut off skin on his chest and back three times larger than the wound on his face. As a result, the wound on his face was not healed, but instead two new wounds were added. Today, when he returned to the embrace of his motherland, he shouted angrily: "Man-eating beasts, American aggressors, get out of our motherland!" A captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers named Shen Gongying had a leg wound that had not healed from 1950 to the present. The "doctor" in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp once said that he would treat him, but instead cut the wound larger and larger, and the bone was exposed. Since then, not only has he not received responsible treatment, but he has been forced to have blood drawn several times. On one occasion, the U.S. personnel tied him up and forcibly drew 200 cc of blood, and he fainted on the spot.

    朝中方面和对方八月十三日继续遣返战俘
    我方归来人员纷纷控诉美方残酷迫害的暴行
    【新华社开城十三日电】八月十三日，我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百五十名，朝鲜籍战俘二百五十名，总数为四百名。在非朝鲜籍战俘中包括美国籍七十五名，英国籍七十五名。
    对方遣返给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员二千一百六十名（其中包括伤病人员三百六十名），中国人民志愿军被俘人员二百二十二名。
    今天遣返归来的我方被俘人员有三人于十二日在釜山火车站上被美军用刺刀刺伤头部和手臂，有三名被美军用木棒和铁棍打伤，他们下车后即向联合红十字会小组提出控诉。被刺伤的三人由联合红十字会小组双方人员陪同到红十字会急救所检查伤势，证明确系刺刀所伤。此事将在联合红十字会小组协调组会议上提出讨论。
    【新华社开城十二日电】今天，美方派遣了比过去更多的宪兵来遣送我方被俘人员。在上午第二批十四辆遣送车中，竟有五辆载着美方宪兵和其他军事人员。显然，这是监视我方被俘人员在遣返途中的行动的。
    但是，满怀激愤的我方被俘人员在途中仍然憎恨地扔掉了美方发给他们的衣服、破皮鞋、以及霉烂的饭团。一路上，他们还是挥舞系在拐杖上的他们自己缝制的国旗。遣送车到达我方交接区后，他们激动地欢呼、歌唱和高呼口号。朝鲜人民军被俘人员朴明洙又带来了一幅用衬衣布片缝成的控诉书。在这份控诉书上写着美方在巨济岛第十三号战俘营内种种虐待和迫害战俘的罪行，还有着这个战俘营内四百七十九名朝鲜人民军被俘人员的签名。
    今天归来的被俘人员中，有许多形状令人心酸和悲愤的残废人员。一个名叫李用俊的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，脸上有一大块伤疤，使面貌完全变形。在他的胸前和背上各有一大块伤疤。李用俊说，由于他在美方进行强迫“甄别”时，坚持返回祖国，美方战俘营里的“医生”藉口医治他脸上的伤口，在他胸前和背上割下比他面部的伤口还大三倍的皮。结果，脸上的伤口固然没有治好，反而增加了两个新的伤口。今天，他回到祖国怀抱时愤怒地喊道：“吃人的野兽，美国侵略者滚出我们的祖国去！”一个名叫申共影的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，他腿部的伤口从一九五零年到现在还没有痊愈。美方战俘营里的“医生”有一次说是要替他治疗，结果反而把伤口越割越大，骨头也露了出来。自此以后，他不但没有得到负责的治疗，反而被强迫抽过好几次血。有一次，美方人员把他绑了起来，强迫抽了他二百西西血，他当场就昏了过去。
