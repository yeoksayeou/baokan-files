    The Iron and Steel Industry Bureau Directs Swift Improvement of High-Temperature Operating Environments
    Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has become extremely hot. In many enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau, high temperatures have caused difficulties for workers, and cases of heatstroke have occurred continuously. Some workshops have even had to suspend operations due to the threat of high temperatures.
    The main reasons for the heatstroke incidents in high-temperature workshops this year are the insufficient attention paid to this issue by enterprise leaders, a lack of early preparation, and the failure to take necessary measures. Some units, although they had prepared, delayed taking action due to the absence of dedicated personnel responsible. For example, the cooling measures plan at the Southwest Plant 102, which included the installation of two large fans, was scheduled to be completed in September. However, due to continuous urging from superiors and the increasing severity of worker fainting incidents, the plant leadership began to pay attention. Tianjin Steel Plant had planned to add air showers in the rolling mill workshop of the fourth branch plant, the ferroalloy workshop of the third branch plant, and the steelmaking department this year, with completion scheduled for the second quarter. However, except for the fourth branch plant, none have been installed. Although Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant adopted the seven measures proposed by the plant's second employee representative assembly in April regarding heatstroke prevention equipment in the foundry, such as increasing ventilation and smoke exhaust equipment and building shaded areas for loading and unloading workers, only one has been completed to date. Even pots for boiling mung bean soup and jars for serving the soup were not prepared by early July, and salt soda tablets were not sent to health authorities for testing and preparation in a timely manner, resulting in a shortage when urgently needed.
    Currently, many enterprises have begun to take some measures, such as providing workers with cooling beverages, increasing ventilation and cooling equipment, reducing radiant heat from high-temperature equipment, increasing protective equipment, and adjusting labor organization. In order to further improve cooling work, the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry and the National Metal Smelting Trade Union have issued urgent instructions, urging enterprises to promptly take measures to improve high-temperature operating environments, and particularly pointed out that the water mist spraying method, which has proven effective in the Southwest, should be implemented immediately.

    钢铁工业局指示迅速改善高温操作环境
    今年入夏以来，天气骤热，钢铁工业管理局所属很多企业中，由于高温的威胁，造成工人操作上的困难，工人中暑事故连续发生，个别车间亦曾发生因高温威胁而停车的现象。
    今年高温车间发生中暑事故的主要原因，是由于企业领导方面对这一问题的重视不够，没有早作准备，采取必要的措施；有些单位虽已准备，但因无专人负责而拖延未加解决。如西南一○二厂降温措施计划中，二场大风扇安装计划要拖到九月才能完成，后因上级不断督促和工人昏倒现象日趋严重，厂领导方面才重视起来；天津钢厂本年在四分厂轧钢车间、三分厂铁合金车间、以及炼钢部均列有添加空气淋浴的措施，并计划在第二季完成，但现在除四分厂以外均未安装；石景山钢铁厂虽采纳了该厂本年四月第二届职工代表大会有关铸造场防暑设备措施的建议，如增加通风输烟设备、修装卸工人活动凉棚等七项措施，至今只完成了一项，至七月初连煮绿豆汤的锅和盛汤的缸都未准备好，盐汽水片也未及时送请卫生机关化验配制，以致在急需时供应不上。
    目前，很多企业都开始采取了一些措施，如供应工人清凉饮料，增加通风和冷却设备，降低高温设备的辐射热，增加防护用品及调整劳动组织等。为了进一步作好降温工作，中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局、全国五金冶炼工会已分别发出紧急指示，督促各企业单位迅速采取措施，改善高温操作环境，特别指出西南现已行之有效的喷射水雾办法应立即推行。
