    The First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government Translates a Batch of Soviet Industrial Education Films
    In order to introduce the advanced construction experience of the Soviet Union for our country to learn from, the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government began to translate Soviet industrial education films in the spring of last year. The first batch of eighteen films has been entrusted to the Shanghai Film Studio for production and will be completed successively this year. Among them, "Metal Welding and Cutting," "Powder Metallurgy," and "Heating Radiator Production Process" will be released in mid-August. "Metal Welding and Cutting" introduces the great inventions and development process of the Soviet Union in the welding industry, and introduces various welding machines and their advanced operation methods. This advanced experience is of great use to our country's construction industry and ship and vehicle manufacturing industry. "Powder Metallurgy" introduces a new metal product manufacturing method invented by the Soviet Union. This method does not require casting and mechanical processing, but uses metal powder to directly make various high-quality products through pressing and sintering. It is very enlightening for our country's non-ferrous metal industry. "Heating Radiator Production Process" introduces the automated production process of manufacturing heating radiators in the Soviet Union, which is very helpful for the casting department.
    These industrial education films are excellent industrial education materials for students of industrial schools and technical training classes, workers and technicians in factories and construction sites, and scientific workers.

    Handan Special District Film Team Shows Movies to Farmers in Mountainous and Disaster Areas
    From May 1st to mid-July, the first and second teams of the Hebei Handan Special District Film Team went deep into the plains, mountainous areas, and disaster areas to show farmers films such as "Eliminating Locusts," "Xiao Erhei Gets Married," "Two Families' Spring," "Defending the Fruits of Victory," and "People's Fighters." Because some of the films, such as "Eliminating Locusts," are closely related to farmers' production, and the film team made sufficient preparations in advance, not only were the sound and light clear during the screening, but the projectionists also introduced the content of the films and explained the difficult-to-understand shots; therefore, the audience could see clearly, hear clearly, and understand, and were very interested in the films. The film team was greatly welcomed by the masses. The screening of the film "Eliminating Locusts" enabled farmers in disaster areas to learn a lot of knowledge about locust control and increased their confidence in locust control. Some mountainous people had never seen a play before and were even more interested in the film team going to the mountains to show movies. The film projection team also strengthened the explanation of the films in light of the situation in the mountainous areas, which played a significant role in the farmers in the mountainous areas accepting the content of the films. From May 1st to July 15th, the two projection teams screened a total of 102 shows, and more than 104,000 people were educated.

    Suiyuan Provincial People's Government Culture Bureau Establishes a Pastoral Area Mobile Cultural Center
    In order to adapt to the conditions of the pastoral area and develop the Mongolian culture, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government Culture Bureau established a pastoral area mobile cultural center in Darhan Muming'an Joint Banner of Ulanqab League in the province in July this year, which began to work in the pastoral area on August 5. During the preparation process, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government allocated 50 million yuan to help.
    In order to adapt to the vast grasslands, sparse population, and inconvenient transportation in the pastoral area, the museum has now purchased two horses, two camels, a Mongolian yurt, a tent, and a rubber-tired cart. It has purchased 48 kinds of Mongolian books, a total of 374 copies, and 21 sets of models of maternal and child health and venereal disease prevention and treatment, as well as various Mongolian books and newspapers. It also plans to purchase various books, newspapers, and picture magazines for herdsmen in the future.
    In addition to regularly touring exhibitions in pastoral areas and supplying herdsmen with cultural food, the museum also plans to collect folk art materials, absorb folk artists, and carry out cultural and recreational publicity activities in coordination with various tasks in pastoral areas. Now the horse-head fiddle, erhu, nanhu, phonograph, and radio are all purchased and ready, and on August 5th, they drove the camels and carts to the first Noto of Damao Joint Banner (district) to start work.

    The First Batch of Graduates of the Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School Attached to Dalian Institute of Technology Graduates
    The first batch of graduates from the Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School attached to Dalian Institute of Technology held a graduation ceremony on the 8th. They will go to university to continue their studies, and some students will study in the Soviet Union. Most of these graduates were originally industrial workers. When they entered the Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Middle School in 1950, many of them only had a primary school education, and some had only studied for one or two years. However, due to their hard work under the active teaching of the teachers, they finally completed the entire six-year curriculum of junior and senior high school in three years. They have reached a certain level in general science knowledge and language knowledge. Currently, these graduates are reviewing their lessons to prepare for further studies.
