    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Other Organizations Jointly Hold a Memorial Meeting to Commemorate the 15th Anniversary of Stanislavski's Death
    The All-China Federation of Drama Workers, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Soviet Union's Foreign Cultural Association jointly held a memorial meeting in Beijing on the evening of the 7th to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the death of the great Soviet theatrical artist Stanislavski. Attending the memorial meeting were China's famous drama theorists, writers, and directors Jiao Juyin, Ouyang Shanzun, Wu Xue, Luo Heru, An E, and more than two hundred literary and art workers from the capital.
    Also present were Sokolov, the representative of the Soviet Union's Foreign Cultural Association in China, and many Soviet friends.
    Zhang Geng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Drama Workers, delivered the opening speech, calling on the Chinese drama community to better learn from Stanislavski, the great mentor of the theatrical world.
    Jiao Juyin, Vice President of the Beijing People's Art Theater and a famous director, delivered a report on "Learning from Stanislavski" at the meeting. He first pointed out that Stanislavski's continuous efforts in exploring and experimenting in theatrical work throughout his life led to the completion of his great system of theatrical art, creating a broad path for stage art. This is not only a glorious asset of the Soviet Union but also a banner for progressive art workers all over the world. Stanislavski's system stems from life and reality, providing directors and actors with the basic principles and laws of stage art. Jiao Juyin then called on Chinese drama workers to first understand the spiritual essence of Stanislavski's system and then repeatedly study it through practice to further develop China's theatrical art.
    At the memorial meeting, a stage play film recording of "The Lower Depths," directed by Stanislavski, was also shown.
