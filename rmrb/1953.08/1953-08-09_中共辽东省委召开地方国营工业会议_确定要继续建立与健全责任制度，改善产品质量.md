The CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee convened the Liaoning Provincial Local State-Owned Industry Conference from July 7th to 14th to strengthen the work of local state-owned industry. This conference used criticism and self-criticism to examine and summarize the operational thinking and guidelines of the province's local state-owned industry over the past few years, studied the existing problems in local state-owned industry, and clarified the direction of future efforts.

Over the past few years, Liaoning Province has actively restored and developed local state-owned industry, producing a large amount of means of production and means of subsistence. At the same time, it vigorously raised funds, carried out key basic construction, and gradually strengthened planning. However, there were still many shortcomings and errors in the restoration and development of local state-owned industry. Before this year, the main error in the operational thinking of enterprise management cadres was a one-sided pursuit of profit. Some enterprises often deviated from the guidance of the state plan, ignored the combination of supply, production, and sales, lacked a policy perspective, inappropriately raised product prices, and even falsely reported costs, failed to abide by production and sales contracts, and failed to guarantee product quality. Some economic agencies and enterprise leading cadres did not seriously investigate conditions such as supply, production, capital, technology, cadres, and workers, and eagerly demanded development. This led to a serious disconnection between production and sales or a chaotic phenomenon of alternating increases and decreases in production. The errors in basic construction were mainly manifested as blind advancement. For example, the province's silk reeling equipment had not been fully utilized, but several county-run silk reeling factories were blindly built. These factories were merged and reduced soon after construction. When carrying out basic construction, most factory and mine cadres ignored the utilization of existing equipment and the exploitation of potential, and eagerly demanded the addition of new equipment. The conference criticized this subjective and one-sided thinking of eagerly seeking development regardless of various conditions and the individualistic thinking of "big factories, big factory directors."

The conference decided that the future policy of Liaoning's local state-owned industry is to further consolidate and improve existing enterprises. Liaoning Province's local state-owned industry has developed rapidly in recent years, but the level of enterprise leadership and management is very low. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the level of enterprise management.

This year, in the struggle against bureaucracy, the above-mentioned tendency of greed for more and bigger, and blind development was criticized, and the policy of consolidation and improvement was emphasized. As a result, many enterprise leading cadres developed a negative sentiment, believing that "consolidation and improvement is maintaining the status quo, and there is no prospect of development." Some people also believe that "consolidation is closing down," so they are not at ease in their work and want to transfer to state-owned enterprises. The comrades who attended the meeting cited many facts to show that local state-owned industry can only develop well by implementing the policy of consolidation and improvement. In January of this year, more than a dozen units of local state-owned enterprises in Liaoyang City saw that the country had begun large-scale economic construction this year, so they all ordered plans to expand production and asked the state to invest more. However, these enterprises all ignored improving management and political work, so they did not complete the state plan in the first quarter. Later, the leading organs criticized this erroneous thinking, implemented the policy of consolidation and improvement in the second quarter, strengthened enterprise management, and improved output and quality. With improved product quality, products that had no sales in the past now had sales.

The conference also studied the work for the third quarter. It was determined that continuing to establish and improve the responsibility system, further improve product quality, strengthen education on labor discipline, and strive to complete or over fulfill the state plan will be the central work for the third quarter.

    中共辽东省委召开地方国营工业会议
    确定要继续建立与健全责任制度，改善产品质量
    中共辽东省委为加强地方国营工业工作，在七月七日到十四日召开了辽东省地方国营工业会议。这次会议以批评与自我批评的方法检查与总结了几年来全省地方国营工业的经营思想和经营方针，研究了目前地方国营工业中存在的问题，明确了今后努力方向。
    几年来，辽东省积极地恢复和发展地方国营工业，生产了大量的生产资料和生活资料，同时，大力筹措了资金，有重点进行了基本建设，逐步加强了计划性。但在地方国营工业的恢复发展中，还有许多缺点和错误：今年以前，企业管理干部的经营思想上的主要错误是片面追求利润，有些企业常常脱离国家计划的指导，忽视供、产、销结合，缺乏政策观点，不适当地提高产品价格，甚至假报成本、不守产销合同、不保证产品质量。有些经济机关和企业领导干部，没有认真地考察供、产、资金、技术、干部、工人等条件，急于要求发展。这就促成了产销的严重脱节或时而增产时而减产的混乱现象，在基本建设上的错误，主要表现为盲目冒进。如全省缫丝设备尚未充分利用，又盲目地建设了几个县营缫丝厂，这几个厂建设不久，就又实行并缩。多数厂矿干部，在进行基本建设时，忽视对现有设备的利用和潜在力的发掘，急于要求增加新设备。大会批判了这种不顾各种条件急求发展的主观片面思想和“厂子大、厂长也大”的个人主义思想。
    会议决定今后辽东地方国营工业的方针是进一步巩固和提高现有的企业。辽东省地方国营工业几年来发展很快，但企业领导管理水平很低。因此，必须提高企业管理水平。
    今年，在反官僚主义斗争中，对上述贪多贪大、盲目发展的偏向，曾经进行了批判，强调贯彻巩固和提高的方针。于是许多企业领导干部便产生了一种消极情绪，认为“巩固和提高就是维持现状，没有发展前途了。”还有人认为“巩固是收摊子”，因而不安心工作，想转到国营企业。这次到会的同志列举了许多事实，说明只有贯彻巩固和提高的方针，地方国营工业才能很好发展。今年一月份，辽阳市地方国营企业十多个单位，看到今年国家开始进行大规模的经济建设了，于是他们也都订了扩大生产的计划，要求国家多投资。但是，这些企业都忽视了改善管理工作与政治工作，因此第一季度都没完成国家计划。后来领导机关批判了这一错误思想，在第二季度内贯彻了巩固和提高的方针，加强了企业管理，提高了产量和质量，产品质量好了，过去没有销路的产品这时也有了销路。
    会议关于第三季度工作，还作了研究。确定继续建立与健全责任制度，进一步改善产品质量，加强劳动纪律的教育，争取完成或超额完成国家计划为第三季度中心工作。
