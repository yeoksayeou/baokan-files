Dear Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    As the first People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province is being held on the southwestern border of our great motherland, allow us to extend our heartfelt gratitude and highest respect to you on behalf of the 400,000 people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region!

    For more than two years, you, together with the Korean People's Army, have fought heroically, enduring countless hardships and fearing no bloodshed or sacrifice, severely打击ing (Translator's note: This is a term of condemnation which is impossible to translate exactly, but it means 'striking a heavy blow against') the most ferocious enemy of all ethnic groups – U.S. imperialism, and achieving a glorious victory. You have safeguarded peace in the Far East and the world, protected the economic construction of our motherland, and safeguarded the happy lives of our people of all ethnic groups. This has enabled us to establish our own Autonomous Region and autonomous organs on our rich and beautiful land, in a peaceful and tranquil environment, following the general path of the Common Program, and according to our own wishes, jointly enjoying an equal, united and happy life in the big family of the motherland. We hereby assure you that in the future we will unite even more closely around Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, consolidate the unity among and within all ethnic groups, strengthen the struggle against the enemy, cooperate with the People's Liberation Army and the People's Public Security Forces, eliminate the remaining bandits and secret agents, strive to develop production, and jointly fight to the end to defend the national defense of the motherland.

    The First People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province
