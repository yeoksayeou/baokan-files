    On the Frontlines of National Economic Construction
    Shanxi Workers Propose Numerous Innovations, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Suggestions
    In the first half of this year, a large number of innovations, technical improvements, and rationalization suggestions emerged from workers in state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines throughout Shanxi Province. Incomplete statistics from just seventy-six factories and mines across the province show that workers made over 12,770 innovation, technical improvement, and rationalization suggestions. Of these, 8,427 have already been implemented. These innovations, improvements, and rationalization suggestions, when applied to production, have created enormous wealth for the country. The value created by just 224 of these implemented innovations and improvements reached 3.523 billion yuan.
    The emergence of a large number of workers' innovations, technical improvements, and rationalization suggestions plays a significant role in overcoming outdated production equipment in various factories and mines, increasing production, and unlocking production potential. For example, when the Shanxi Machine Factory began producing drilling machines this year, the metalworking workshop originally planned to add sixteen milling machines and seventy-four workers. After worker discussions and improvements to the old machines, they only added two milling machines and no additional workers, successfully producing the drilling machines. The "Lida-style sheet metal flyer" successfully trial-produced by workers at the Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant more than doubled work efficiency and reduced waste products, saving the country 2 billion yuan annually. At the Thin Plate Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, workers solved the problem of reducing the temperature of the rolling mill, allowing each rolling mill to roll an additional 1,670 tons of steel billets per month, increasing output by 75 percent.
    State-owned Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory Successfully Trials Chloramphenicol, an Effective Typhoid Drug
    Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the State-owned Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory successfully trialed chloramphenicol, an effective drug for typhoid fever.
    Chloramphenicol is already used in the Soviet Union and is an effective drug for treating typhoid fever, pertussis, and other ailments. It is also effective in treating influenza and infantile dysentery. With the help of Soviet experts, the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory began researching the manufacture of chloramphenicol last year. Through the efforts of researchers, it has now been preliminarily successful. Tests on the trial-produced samples have proven that the quality is no lower than that of imported goods, and the cost is also lower. The researchers at the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory have also created a new manufacturing method based on the technical and equipment conditions of existing chemical pharmaceutical factories in China.
    Workers at Jiangsu Dazhong Oil and Rice North Factory Successfully Trial Pressing Rice Bran Oil
    Workers in the oil pressing workshop of the Dazhong Oil and Rice North Factory in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, successfully trialed pressing rice bran oil after employees of the Grain Bureau of Longxi County, Fujian Province, trialed pressing oil from rice bran. The oil yield from the trial pressing at the Dazhong Oil and Rice North Factory was higher than that of the employees of the Grain Bureau of Longxi County. Oil pressing worker Ling Kequan initially used 142 jin of rice bran and followed the operating methods for pressing rapeseed oil to extract 18 jin of rice bran oil. Later, Ling Kequan, Wang Chang, and Shi Guizhang further researched and improved the oil pressing technology. Using 156 jin of rice bran (14 jin more than the first trial pressing), the oil yield increased to 21.3 jin. (In Longxi County, 7.3 to 8.12 jin of oil are produced from every 100 jin of rice bran.)
    Rice bran oil has a low cost and wide range of uses. Industrially, it can be used as a lubricant; it can be mixed with boiled oil to create a bright and lustrous color. Rice bran oil can also be used for edible purposes and is rich in Vitamin B. Rice bran cake can also be used as fertilizer.
    Phosphorus Mine Discovered in Guizhou
    The Geological Exploration Team of the Industry Department of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government recently discovered a rich phosphorus mine in a certain location. Based solely on the exposed portion, the phosphorus mine has reserves of over 10 million tons, and is of excellent quality. In addition to its role in China's chemical and metallurgical industries, this phosphorus mine can also be used to produce phosphorus fertilizer, which is lacking in Guizhou, to increase crop yields.
    Bumper Wheat Harvest from Xinjiang Military Region Troops
    The winter wheat and spring wheat, planted on over 280,000 mu and 210,000 mu respectively, by the agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have all been harvested, yielding a bumper harvest unprecedented in the past three years. The average yield of winter wheat per mu was 151 jin, an increase of 13.5 percent over last year. The average yield of spring wheat per mu was 123 jin. Particularly high yields included: over 245 jin per mu from over 40,000 mu of winter wheat from a certain unit; 400 jin per mu from over 4,000 mu of high-yielding winter wheat from a certain unit, including six mu yielding 1,100 jin per mu; 800 jin per mu from 147 mu of spring wheat from a certain unit, including nine mu yielding 1,200 jin per mu. During the wheat harvest, horse-drawn harvesters, combines, and other equipment were deployed. Under the slogan of "quick harvest, quick threshing, quick storage," the soldiers were extremely enthusiastic. The horse-drawn harvester of Xia Liansheng's harvesting team from a certain unit harvested 131 mu in one day; soldier Xin Farong bundled 1,640 bundles of wheat in one day. To avoid scattering wheat ears, each unit organized inspection teams to check the harvesting quality and field seed selection work at any time.
    Tibetan Farmers Prepare for Autumn Harvest
    In the main agricultural areas of Tibet, along the Yarlung Tsangpo River and on the Lhasa Plain, highland barley and wheat are about to ripen, and the wheat fields have turned golden. Farmers in various regions are preparing to harvest with joy.
    Even rainfall and meticulous cultivation are the main reasons for the good crop growth this year. Farmers in many areas have greatly increased their enthusiasm for production after receiving interest-free agricultural loans issued by the People's Liberation Army this year. In addition to reclaiming wasteland to expand cultivated land, the fields have generally been weeded twice and irrigated three or four times. This year, the cultivated area in Lhaze Dzong and Gyaca Kesum of the upper reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River has expanded by more than 13,000 mu compared to previous years. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Shigatse Dzong issued water conservancy loans to local people and helped them build canals. It is estimated that grain production will increase by about 10,000 grams (25 jin per gram) this year. Farmers in Shigatse Dzong recently sent a telegram to Chairman Mao to thank the People's Liberation Army for their help.
    Unprecedented Sea Cucumber Harvest on Weizhou Island, Guangxi Province
    Weizhou Island in the Beibu Gulf, southern Guangxi Province, is experiencing an unprecedented sea cucumber harvest this year. According to incomplete statistics from the past two months, the island's fishermen have caught more than 500,000 jin of fresh sea cucumbers.
    Fishermen on Weizhou Island have not been accustomed to catching sea cucumbers for many years. People in other places also rarely knew that sea cucumbers were produced here. In recent years, the sales channels for sea cucumbers have gradually opened up; local aquatic product companies have appropriately adjusted the price of sea cucumbers and purchased them in large quantities; and cooperatives have timely supplied fishermen with various tools for catching sea cucumbers. As a result, fishermen's enthusiasm for catching sea cucumbers has greatly increased. Currently, it is the sea cucumber production season. Whenever the tide recedes, the island's fishermen go to sea to catch sea cucumbers, each person catching 100 to 300 jin of fresh sea cucumbers per day.
    This year's sea cucumber harvest has greatly improved the lives of fishermen on Weizhou Island. In the past, during this season, fishermen could only eat papaya and banana pith, etc. Now, they can eat coarse grains and rice. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在祖国经济建设的战线
    山西大批工人提出创造、技术改进和合理化建议
    今年上半年，山西全省国营、地方国营厂矿出现大批工人的创造、技术改进和合理化建议。仅据全省七十六个厂矿的不完全统计，工人的创造、技术改进和合理化建议就有一万二千七百七十余件。其中有八千四百二十七件已经实施。这些创造、改进以及合理化建议运用到生产中后，为国家创造了巨大的财富，仅运用到生产中的二百二十四件创造、改进等，所创造的价值就达到三十五亿二千三百余万元。
    大批工人的创造、技术改进以及合理化建议的出现，对克服各厂矿生产设备落后，提高生产，发挥生产潜在能力作用很大。如山西机器厂今年开始生产钻探机时，金工车间原计划需要增加十六台铣车，七十四个工人，经过工人讨论，把旧机器改进后，只增加了两台铣车，也没有增加工人就成功地进行了钻探机生产。经纬纺织机械制造厂工人试制成功的“立达式铁皮锭翼”，使工作效率提高了一倍多，并减少了废品，一年可给国家节省二十亿元。太原钢铁厂薄板部，工人们解决了降低轧辊热度的问题，使每架轧机每月可多轧钢坯一千六百七十吨，产量提高百分之七十五。
    国营东北化学制药厂试制伤寒特效药氯霉素成功
    国营东北化学制药厂在苏联专家指导下，试制伤寒特效药氯霉素成功。
    氯霉素在苏联已经使用，是医治伤寒、百日咳等症的特效药，也是医治流行性感冒、小儿痢疾的有效药品。东北化学制药厂在苏联专家帮助下，从去年开始就研究制造氯霉素，经过研究人员的努力，现已初步成功。试制的样品，经过化验，证明质量并不低于国外进口货，成本也低廉。东北化学制药厂的研究人员并根据我国现有化学制药厂的技术、设备条件，创造了一种新的制造方法。
    江苏大众油米北厂工人试榨秕糠油成功
    江苏省兴化县大众油米北厂制油间工人在福建省龙溪县人民政府粮食厅职工试用秕糠榨油后，用秕糠榨油试制成功。大众油米北厂试榨的出油量比龙溪县粮食厅职工试榨时有增加。榨油工人凌克泉开始用一百四十二斤秕糠，按照榨菜籽油的操作方法榨出糠油十八斤。后来又由凌克泉、王长和施桂章三人进一步研究，改进了榨油技术。用一百五十六斤秕糠（比第一次试榨秕糠数量增加十四斤秕糠），结果出油量增加到二十一斤三两。（龙溪县每一百斤秕糠出油七斤三两到八斤十二两。）
    秕糠油的成本低，用途大，工业上可作为油润原料；可配熬熟油，颜色鲜润。秕糠油还可用于食用，含有丰富的维他命乙。秕糠饼还可做肥料。
    贵州发现磷矿
    贵州省人民政府工业厅地质勘探队最近在某地发现蕴藏丰富的磷矿。只就露头部分计算，磷矿的储量就在一千多万吨以上，品质优良。这一磷矿的发现，除对我国化学工业和冶金工业有作用外，磷矿还可以用来制造贵州所缺少的磷肥，以增加农作物的产量。
    新疆军区部队所种小麦丰收
    中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产部队种植的二十八万多亩冬小麦和二十一万多亩春小麦已全部收割完毕，获得了三年来未有的丰收。冬小麦每亩平均产量为一百五十一斤，比去年增产百分之十三点五；春小麦每亩平均产量为一百二十三斤。产量特别高的有：某部四万多亩冬小麦每亩产二百四十五斤以上。某部四千多亩丰产冬小麦每亩产四百斤，其中有六亩每亩产一千一百斤。某部一百四十七亩春小麦每亩产八百斤，其中有九亩每亩产一千二百斤。麦收期间，马拉收割机、康拜因收割机等一齐出动。战士们在快收、快打、快入仓的口号下，热情极高。某部夏连生收割小组的马拉收割机，一天收割一百三十一亩；战士辛发荣一天内捆麦一千六百四十捆。为避免抛撒麦穗，各单位都组织了检查组，随时检查收割质量和田间选种工作。
    西藏农民准备秋收
    在西藏主要农业区雅鲁藏布江沿岸和拉萨平原上的青稞、小麦即将成熟，麦田已经变得一片金黄。各地农民正以愉快心情准备收割。
    雨水均匀，耕作细致是今年作物生长良好的主要原因。很多地区的农民今年得到人民解放军发放的无利农业贷款后，生产情绪大大提高，除开垦荒地扩大耕地面积外，一般的田地都拔过两次草，灌了三四次水。雅鲁藏布江上游拉孜宗和加庆则谿卡今年的耕地面积即较往年扩大了一万三千多亩。驻日喀则宗的人民解放军部队在当地发放水利贷款，帮助群众修筑水渠，估计今年可增产粮食一万克（每克二十五市斤）左右。日喀则宗农民最近向毛主席打电报感谢人民解放军对他们的帮助。
    广西省涠洲岛海参空前丰产
    广西省南部东京湾涠洲岛今年海参空前丰产。据最近两个月的不完全统计，该岛渔民共捕得鲜海参五十多万市斤。
    涠洲岛渔民已多年不习惯捕捉海参。外地也很少知道这里出产海参。近年来，海参销路逐步打开；当地水产公司适当调整了海参价格，大量进行收购；合作社又及时供给渔民各种捕参用具。渔民捕捉海参的情绪因而大大提高。目前正是海参产期，每逢潮退，岛上渔民即纷纷下海捕参，每人每天能捕捉鲜参一百到三百市斤。
    今年海参丰产，涠洲岛上渔民生活已有很大改善。过去在这个季节，渔民们只能吃到木瓜、芭蕉芯等，现在都能吃到杂粮和大米了。（新华社）
