    Introducing "Science Bulletin"
    Jin Yuxing
    "Science Bulletin" is a comprehensive scientific publication (monthly) published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It serves as a tool for the Academy to guide scientific research in service of national construction. It was first published in May 1950 and merged with "Natural Science," published by the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, in June 1952. Initially, it primarily reflected the activities of scientists within the Academy's scope during the early period of liberation and the adjustments of scientific research institutions after the establishment of the Academy. Later, it mainly focused on reporting the research work of various research units of the Academy, with a gradual increase in the introduction of advanced Soviet science. In both of these aspects, some of the articles published in "Science Bulletin" had a certain influence in the Chinese scientific community. Since January 1952, with the guidance from leadership and the criticism and help from readers, the content of the publication has been somewhat improved; more work has also been done in introducing Soviet science. For example, discussions on Stalin's works on linguistics, on cooperation between science and production, on the organization and leadership of scientific work, on the criticism of "resonance theory" and idealism in quantum mechanics, and on Schmidt's cosmogony have all occupied significant space in "Science Bulletin." In order to oppose the inhumane bacteriological warfare crimes committed by the United States in Korea and China, "Science Bulletin" published a "Special Issue Against Bacteriological Warfare." However, the editorial work at that time did not closely integrate the promotion of Marxism, the introduction of advanced Soviet science, and the reflection of the actual situation of domestic scientific work. As a result, the content of the publication became a large accumulation of translations and theoretical articles, with very little reflection of the actual work of Chinese science.
    In January 1953, in order to change the situation of "Science Bulletin" being divorced from reality and the masses in the past, the leadership of the Academy of Sciences proposed that the content of the journal should strive to achieve the following three requirements: (1) To comprehensively reflect the current main situations and problems of national scientific research work, to reflect the development scale of scientific work in our country, to publicize national policies directly related to scientific work, and to report the role and contribution of scientific research work in the large-scale national construction. (2) To purposefully and systematically introduce advanced Soviet science, especially the development paths of various Soviet sciences, as well as the specific experiences of leading and organizing scientific work and the new achievements of Soviet science. (3) To help scientific workers broaden their horizons, improve their ideological and scientific levels, help scientific workers solve common problems in their work, and conduct discussions on issues such as the integration of theory with practice and learning from the Soviet Union.
    Judging from the articles published in "Science Bulletin" since the January 1953 issue, we can initially understand some important aspects of scientific work in the context of the commencement of large-scale national construction. The publication promptly reported on a series of national scientific work activities of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and industrial departments, and published important reports or related materials from these activities. These activities included: the National Geological Workers Conference of the Central Geological Department, the National Hydropower Survey Conference of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Chemical Industry Research Professional Conference convened by the Chemical Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, as well as the Joint Conference of the National Plant Pathology Conference and the National Congress of the Chinese Plant Pathology Society, the First National Congress of the Geographical Society of China, and the Antibiotics Symposium. Most of the reports or materials from these meetings have guiding significance for current scientific work. Other important scientific activities directly related to national construction, such as the survey of the source of the Yellow River and the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the investigation of soil and water conservation in the Yellow River basin, the survey of the natural conditions of Tibet, the large-scale experiment of cotton aphid control, the control of wheat gall midge, the Northeast soil survey, the national fruit tree production survey, the fertilizer effect test of apatite, and
    The experiment on the manufacture of nodular cast iron by the "magnesium chip knot" magnesium addition method, etc., are also specifically reported in "Science Bulletin." In addition, the publication also published some articles discussing important issues in science and production, such as the exploration of iron, manganese, copper, coal, petroleum and other mineral resources in China, the research on biological stimulators, the research on castor and silkworm breeding problems, and the discussion on wheat spring frost damage problems.
    Another noteworthy content of this year's "Science Bulletin" is a series of articles on the current status of Chinese science. So far, more than a dozen papers have been successively published on: mathematics, astronomy, geophysics, geology, zoology, botany, physiology, paleovertebrate, soil science, linguistics, history, and the overview of modern Chinese science. These papers can generally reflect the development of this science in China more comprehensively, and some further propose opinions on the future development direction and work focus of this science.
    It should be emphasized that "Science Bulletin" conscientiously implements Chairman Mao's instruction on learning from the Soviet Union sincerely and wholeheartedly. The introduction of advanced Soviet science and technology in the publication has always occupied an important position, and the organization of manuscripts is more purposeful and wider in scope than in the past. This year, the first thing to pay attention to is the articles written by Soviet scientists under the inspiration of Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the tasks of Soviet science. These include papers on economics, physics, machinery manufacturing, metallurgical industry, biochemistry, microbiology, etc., as well as an important report by Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, on the tasks of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. At the same time, "Science Bulletin" also focused on introducing the development path of Soviet science and the experience of leading and organizing scientific work. Among them, such as Tobucheev's report on the main stages of the development of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a summary of the work of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1952, and other papers written by scientists on the development of Soviet technical science and the development of Soviet chemistry over the past 35 years. These papers are very likely to attract the attention of readers. "Science Bulletin" has always attached importance to reporting the new achievements of Soviet science and the activities of Soviet scientists in communist construction. This year, in addition to translating several summary articles by Nesmeyanov and Barkin in this regard, the work of Soviet scientists in the Turkmen Main Canal area, the Volga-Don Canal project, as well as the achievements in the study of the origin of stars, semiconductors, structural design, the origin of cells, locusts, and the increase in production in the non-black soil zone have all been introduced.
    "Science Bulletin" reflects the activities of many Soviet experts working in China and Soviet scientists visiting China - such as Grusenko (biology), Yefimov (history), Shaichikov (geography), Ivanov (agricultural science), Mosiyev (geology), Loginov (geology), Nikitin (hydropower engineering), Asefpkov (architecture), etc. The special reports made by Soviet experts based on the actual situation in China have greatly inspired and guided the relevant scientific work in China, so they are extremely welcomed by Chinese scientists.
    Another important series of articles on learning from the Soviet Union is organized based on the activities of the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation to the Soviet Union. These situations, characteristics and historical experiences of Soviet science introduced through the experience of Chinese scientists themselves will undoubtedly have a huge impact on the development of Chinese science.
    The introduction of the scientific work of the people's democratic countries also occupies a certain position in the "Science Bulletin". There are special articles introducing the science of North Korea, Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Albania.
    In the sad days of the passing of Comrade Stalin, the great friend and mentor of the Chinese people, "Science Bulletin" published a series of memorial articles written by many famous Chinese scientists. Comrade Stalin will always live in the hearts of the Chinese people and Chinese scientists.
    In order to more comprehensively and timely reflect the situation of scientific work,
    "Science Bulletin" has specially opened a "Brief News" column, which is dedicated to publishing brief reports on scientific activities in China, the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries and other countries.
    The improvements in "Science Bulletin" this year are significant, and these improvements are welcomed by the majority of readers. However, "Science Bulletin" obviously still has many shortcomings, that is, the reflection of the situation is not comprehensive enough, the publicity and reporting is not systematic enough, especially it has not well reflected the main problems existing in the current scientific work, so as to organize discussions around these problems and launch criticism and self-criticism in scientific work. This situation makes it impossible to have a good guiding role in scientific research work. But we believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and with the care and support of the majority of scientists and the broad masses, "Science Bulletin" will be able to gradually overcome these shortcomings and gradually take on its own tasks.

    介绍“科学通报”
    金宇星
    “科学通报”是中国科学院出版的综合性的科学刊物（月刊），是科学院指导科学研究工作为国家建设服务的一个工具。它是在一九五○年五月创刊的，一九五二年六月和中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会出版的“自然科学”合刊。最初它主要是反映解放初期科学院范围内科学家的一些活动，和科学院成立后科学研究机构调整的情况；以后则以科学院各研究单位研究工作的报道为主要内容，对苏联先进科学的介绍也逐渐增加。在这两方面，“科学通报”刊登的若干文章曾在中国科学界中发生了一定的影响。自一九五二年一月以后，在领导方面的指示和读者的批评、帮助下，刊物的内容有了一些改进；在介绍苏联科学方面，也做了较多的工作。如关于斯大林论语言学问题著作的讨论，关于科学与生产合作、科学工作的组织领导问题，关于“共振论”和量子力学中唯心论的批判，以及施密特的天体演化学等，都在“科学通报”上占有较多的篇幅。为反对美国在朝鲜和中国所进行的绝灭人性的细菌战的罪行，“科学通报”曾出了一本“反细菌战特刊”。但是，当时的编辑工作还没有把宣传马克思主义、介绍苏联先进科学、反映国内科学工作情况密切结合起来。结果，刊物的内容形成了大量的翻译、理论文章的堆积，而很少反映中国科学工作的实际。
    一九五三年一月，为了改变“科学通报”过去脱离实际、脱离群众的情况，科学院领导方面提出该刊的内容应争取达到如下的三个要求：（一）比较全面地反映全国科学研究工作当前的主要情况和问题，反映我国科学工作的发展规模，宣传和科学工作直接有关的国家政策，报道科学研究工作在国家大规模建设中的作用和贡献。（二）有目的、有计划地介绍苏联先进科学，特别是介绍苏联各门科学发展的道路以及领导、组织科学工作等各项具体经验和苏联科学的新成就。（三）帮助科学工作者扩大眼界、提高思想水平和科学水平，帮助科学工作者解决在工作中带有普遍性的问题，开展关于理论联系实际和学习苏联等问题的讨论。
    从一九五三年一月号起的“科学通报”所刊登的文章看来，我们可以初步了解到在国家开始大规模建设中科学工作的一些重要情况。该刊及时地报道了中国科学院和产业部门一系列的全国性科学工作活动的情况，发表了这些活动中的重要报告或有关的材料。这些活动包括：中央地质部的全国地质工作人员会议、燃料工业部的全国水力发电勘测会议、重工业部化学工业管理局召开的化学工业研究专业会议以及全国植物病理会议和中国植物病理学会全国代表大会联合会、中国地理学会的第一届全国代表大会、抗生素座谈会等。这些会议的报告或材料的大部分对于当前的科学工作是有指导作用的。和国家建设直接有关的其他的一些重要科学活动，如黄河河源和黄河上游的查勘、黄河流域水土保持的调查、西藏自然概况的调查、棉蚜防治的大规模试验、小麦吸浆虫的防治工作、东北土壤调查、全国果树生产调查、磷灰石的肥效试验，以及
    “镁屑结”加镁法制造球墨铸铁的试验等，“科学通报”中也都有专门报告。此外，该刊还发表了一些讨论科学和生产中重要问题的文章，如对于探勘中国铁、锰、铜、煤、石油等矿产的探讨，生物原刺激素的研究，蓖麻、蚕饲育问题的研究，小麦春冻受害问题的探讨等。
    今年的“科学通报”另一个值得注意的内容，是一系列的关于中国科学现状的文章。到目前为止，已陆续发表的有：数学、天文学、地球物理学、地质学、动物学、植物学、生理学、古脊椎动物学、土壤学、语言学、历史学和中国近代科学概况等十几篇论文。这些论文一般都能比较全面地反映本门科学在中国的发展情况，有些还进一步提出了对本门科学今后发展方向和工作重点的意见。
    应该着重说到的是“科学通报”认真地执行着毛主席关于要诚心诚意地向苏联学习的指示。刊物中关于苏联先进科学技术的介绍，始终占着重要地位，而且稿件组织得比过去更有目的，范围也更广泛。今年首先注意介绍的，是苏联科学家在斯大林的“苏联社会主义经济问题”和苏联共产党第十九次代表大会决议的启示下所提出的关于苏联科学任务的一些文章。其中包括关于经济学、物理学、机器制造业、冶金工业、生物化学、微生物学等方面的论文，以及苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫关于苏联科学院的任务的重要报告。同时，“科学通报”还着重地介绍了苏联科学发展的道路和领导、组织科学工作的经验。其中如托布契也夫的关于苏联科学院发展的主要阶段的报告、关于一九五二年苏联科学院工作的总结以及其他科学家所写的关于三十五年来苏联技术科学的发展、苏联化学的发展等论文。这些论文都很能引起读者的注意。“科学通报”一贯重视报道苏联科学的新成就和苏联科学家在共产主义建设中的活动。今年除了译载涅斯米扬诺夫和巴尔金关于这方面的几篇总结性的文章外，对苏联科学家在土库曼大运河区、伏尔加河—顿河运河工程中的工作，以及在恒星起源、半导体、结构设计、细胞起源、蝗虫、非黑土带的增产问题等研究工作的成就，都作过介绍。
    “科学通报”反映了许多在中国工作的苏联专家和来中国访问的苏联科学家们——如格鲁森科（生物学）、叶菲莫夫（历史学）、沙伊奇柯夫（地理学）、伊凡诺夫（农业科学）、莫西也夫（地质学）、罗吉诺夫（地质学）、倪克勤（水电工程）、阿谢甫可夫（建筑学）等人的活动。苏联专家们针对着中国实际情况所作的专门报告，对中国有关的科学工作，具有极大的启发性和指导性，因此极为中国科学家所欢迎。
    关于学习苏联的另一系列的重要文章，是根据中国科学院访苏代表团的活动所组织成的。这些通过中国科学家自己的体会所介绍出来的苏联科学的情况、特点和历史经验，无疑的，对中国科学的发展，将发生巨大的作用。
    对于介绍人民民主国家的科学工作情况，在“科学通报”中也占有一定的地位。关于朝鲜、德国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚的科学，该刊都有专文介绍。
    在中国人民的伟大朋友和导师斯大林同志逝世的悲痛日子里，“科学通报”发表了一系列的中国的著名科学家们写的许多悼念文章。斯大林同志将永远活在中国人民和中国科学家的心里。
    为了较全面地、及时地反映科学工作的情况，
    “科学通报”特辟了一个“简讯”栏，专门刊载关于中国、苏联、人民民主国家及其他国家科学活动情况的简短报道。
    “科学通报”在今年的改进是显著的，这些改进为广大读者所欢迎。但是“科学通报”目前显然还存在着许多缺点，那就是反映情况不够全面，宣传报道不够系统，尤其是没有很好地反映出目前科学工作中存在的主要问题，从而围绕这些问题组织讨论、展开科学工作中的批评和自我批评。这种情况，使它对科学研究工作还不能有很好的指导作用。但是我们相信，在中国科学院的领导下，在广大科学家和广大群众的关怀和支持下，“科学通报”是能够逐渐克服这些缺点，逐步地来担负起自己的任务的。
