    Xinjiang Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Prepares Autumn Supply Materials in a Timely Manner According to the Needs of All Ethnic Groups

    The Xinjiang Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company is actively improving its management and strengthening its research and investigation. Based on the needs of all ethnic groups, it is preparing various types and colors of cloth in a timely manner to meet the needs of all ethnic groups after agricultural and livestock products are put on the market.

    First, in view of the inconvenient transportation and difficulties in transportation between Xinjiang and the mainland, the Xinjiang Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company strengthened its contacts with relevant departments in Shanghai, Xi'an, Lanzhou and other places to ensure timely allocation of materials. In late June, the company signed a supply contract for the third quarter with the Shanghai and Xi'an Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company purchasing and supply stations. Goods began to be transferred according to the contract in July. The Xi'an Purchasing and Supply Station is currently transferring various cotton cloths to supply the peak season market in advance. All the cotton cloth transferred to Xinjiang in August has been shipped out; the allocation for September has also begun, and all will be completed by the end of August.

    This year, the demand for cloth from all ethnic groups in Xinjiang has increased. The Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company completed 202 percent of its cotton cloth sales plan for the second quarter. They not only demanded an increase in quantity, but also urgently needed a variety of high-quality and beautiful cloths. For example, in late July, gabardine, khaki, floral serge, yellow flannel and various twill fabrics in the Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's stores sold quickly. At the same time, Xinjiang is expected to have a bumper harvest of agricultural and livestock products this year. Based on these circumstances, the Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company decided to appropriately expand promotion in the third quarter, increasing the cotton cloth sales plan by 187 percent. At the same time, in order to further improve the variety supply plan and meet the masses' requirements for varieties and colors, a variety symposium was held in the second quarter. Representatives from local trading companies, cooperatives and private merchants attended. At the meeting, representatives reflected the different needs and opinions of the masses in various places regarding cotton cloth varieties. For example, most ethnic minorities prefer red, followed by purple and cyan; green cotton cloth is not easy to sell; small floral cloths sell well in northern Xinjiang, and large floral cloths sell well in southern Xinjiang; cadres and workers generally prefer blue cloth, etc. The company also set up a "Customer Needs Registration Book" in the store and checked inventory based on customer feedback. When preparing the sales plan for the third quarter, all staff were mobilized to carefully study the varieties, colors and specifications of cotton cloth that sell well during the peak season, based on the opinions of the masses. The variety supply plan drawn up after investigation and research was relatively reasonable. Since the second quarter, there have been no out-of-stock situations or backlogs. At present, various floral fabrics suitable for autumn and winter sales have been transferred from Lanzhou to Dihua in large quantities according to plan.

    In order to expand the scope of cotton cloth promotion and sales, complete the promotion task according to plan, the Xinjiang Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company actively established business relationships with trading companies, cooperatives, private merchants, etc., and prepared to widely sign supply contracts; at the same time, it strengthened publicity and organization work, established sample display points, conducted publicity in factories and mines with samples, held internal commodity exhibitions, and established commodity out-of-stock reporters to promptly understand and solve out-of-stock problems.

    新疆省花纱布公司根据各族人民需要
    及时准备秋季供应物资
    新疆省花纱布公司积极改善经营管理，加强调查研究，根据各族人民的需要，及时准备各种品种花色的布匹，供应农牧产品上市后各族人民的需要。
    新疆省花纱布公司首先根据新疆与内地交通不便、运输困难的情况，加强了和上海、西安、兰州等地有关部门的联系，做到及时调拨物资。该公司在六月下旬就和上海、西安花纱布公司采购供应站签订了第三季度的供应合同。七月份已开始按合同调货。西安采购供应站目前正在提前调运旺季供应市场的各种棉布。八月份调往新疆的棉布，已全部运出；九月份的也开始调拨，八月底可全部运完。
    今年新疆各族人民对布匹的需要量增加，省花纱布公司第二季度棉布销售计划完成了百分之二百零二。他们不仅在数量上要求增加，而且迫切需要多种多样、质好美观的布匹。如七月下旬省花纱布公司门市部的华达呢、卡其、花条哔叽、黄呢及各色斜纹布都销售很快。同时今年新疆农牧产品预计也将丰收。省花纱布公司根据这些情况，决定在第三季度适当扩大推销，将棉布销售计划增大百分之一百八十七；同时，为了进一步做好品种供应计划，满足群众对于花色品种的要求，在第二季度召开了一次品种座谈会。当地贸易公司、合作社和私商都派代表参加。会上代表们反映了各地群众对于棉布品种的不同需要和意见，如各兄弟民族多喜爱红色，次为紫色、青色，绿色棉布不易销售，北疆小花布匹易销，南疆大花布易销，干部和工人一般喜爱蓝布等。该公司还在门市部设立了“顾客需要登记簿”，根据顾客意见，检查了库存。在编制第三季度销货计划时，发动全体工作人员根据群众意见仔细研究了旺销季节棉布的品种、花色和规格。经过调查研究订出的品种供应计划就比较合理。第二季度以来，没有脱销，也没有积压。目前，适合秋冬季销售的各种花布，已经按计划大量从兰州转运迪化。
    新疆省花纱布公司为了扩大棉布推销范围和营业额，按计划完成推销任务，主动和贸易公司、合作社及私商等建立业务关系，准备广泛签订供应合同；同时加强宣传、组织工作，设立样品陈列处，深入厂矿以样品进行宣传，举办内部商品展览，并设立商品脱销报告员，及时了解和解决脱销问题。    （张宝林）
