    After completing the grassroots elections, the people's representatives and village cadres of Changshan Township, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, actively led the township's farmers in implementing the resolution of the first Township People's Congress on ensuring a bumper harvest, launching a vigorous struggle against drought to protect the autumn harvest.

    Since the drought emerged in Changshan Township in July, the township people's representatives and village cadres have actively mobilized the masses to fight drought and protect the autumn harvest to ensure this year's bumper harvest. Under the leadership of cadres and people's representatives, Dafang Village organized 112 male laborers and 13 female laborers to pump water day and night to irrigate the fields, ensuring that 2,768 mu of water-deficient land in the village were filled with water in time, avoiding the threat of drought. The farmers of Guanfang, Xujiayuan, and other three villages even joined together to open a five-mile-long water diversion ditch, pumping water from the river to irrigate the fields. On a night just after a rainstorm, Chen Laichun, Chen Shengfa, Shao Qigao and other people's representatives from three electoral districts in Wan'an Township repaired the field embankments overnight, diverting the rising stream water into the Henghe River. The representatives and cadres also took turns guarding the field embankments overnight. The next day, the water in the Henghe River was full, and the water shortage problem for more than 2,000 mu of fields irrigated by the Henghe River was solved. The farmers said with emotion: The cadres care about everyone's interests like a family. The people's representatives and cadres of QianShan, Huishan, and Dongshan villages held an emergency meeting in early July when the drought first appeared, established a drought resistance committee and a water management team, and led the masses to check the water situation day and night, and unified water release, ensuring that every field had water to use. Chen Yifu, a 63-year-old farmer in Dongshan Village, said: "The spirit of cadres and representatives in serving the people is really great. I was sleeping in bed and didn't even know that they filled my field with water." In order to ensure a comprehensive harvest, the people's representatives and village cadres paid special attention to helping solve the difficulties of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and widowed, orphaned, and childless households who lacked labor. For example, the 18 mu of land cultivated on behalf of the military family in Guanfang Village were all filled with water during the drought resistance efforts. The farmers helped 58-year-old Sun Jindi to pump water seven times for her two mu of land.

    The people's representatives and cadres of Changshan Township care so much about the interests of the people, and they are even more loved and supported by the people of the township. After correcting his past work style of commandism, Township Head Chen Guanquan actively led the masses in rushing to harvest and plant during the general election, and is now leading the masses in fighting drought day and night. In the tense work, he no longer adopts the practice of commandism. People say: Township Head Chen has really changed. Deputy Township Head Yu Zilong stayed by the water pump day and night while leading the masses in Shangxintiao Village to fight drought, helping to pull the wheel despite his illness. The farmers said with emotion: This is indeed a good township head of the people! People's representatives Zhu A Ming and Yang Zhengshun ran to Fuyang City, more than 15 miles away, several times a day to ask someone to repair the water pump. The masses said: "A Ming and Zhengshun have delayed their own production for the sake of everyone. Our whole village guarantees that his fields will not be left uncultivated."

    Thanks to the leadership of the new township people's government, Changshan Township's struggle against drought to protect the autumn harvest has achieved a major victory. Now, walking into Qianshan, Dongshan and other villages, one can see good crops with full grains of rice everywhere in the fields. The farmers are all smiling and preparing to welcome a new year of bumper harvest.

    浙江省富阳县长山乡
    积极执行乡人代大会关于确保丰收的决议
    浙江省富阳县长山乡完成基层选举工作以后，全乡的人民代表和乡村干部积极领导全乡农民执行第一次乡人民代表大会关于确保丰收的决议，全乡展开了轰轰烈烈的抗旱保秋斗争。
    长山乡从七月份发生旱象以后，乡人民代表和乡村干部为确保今年的丰收，便积极发动群众抗旱保秋。该乡大房村在干部和人民代表的领导下，组织了一百十二个男劳动力和十三个女劳动力日夜不停的车水灌田，使全村二千七百六十八亩缺水的田及时地灌满了水，免受了旱灾的威胁。官房、徐家园等三个村的农民，更联合起来开了一条有五里路长的引水沟，从河里车水进来灌田。在一个暴风雨刚过的夜间，该乡万安村三个选区的人民代表陈来春、陈生法、邵启高等连夜修垒了田堰，把上涨的溪水引到横河里来，代表和干部还轮流在田堰上看管了一夜。第二天横河的水满了，依靠横河进行灌溉的二千多亩田的缺水问题解决了。农民们感动的说：干部们关心大家的利益真像一家人一样。前山、晖山、栋山三个村的人民代表与干部，在七月初旬旱象初露时就召开了紧急会议，成立了抗旱委员会和管水小组，领导群众日夜检查水情，统一放水，做到了丘丘田有水使用。栋山村六十三岁的老农民陈义富说：“干部和代表们这种为人民服务的精神真是太好了，我睡在床上晓也不晓得就给我把水放满了。”为了保证全面的丰收，人民代表和乡村干部特别注意帮助解决缺乏劳动力的革命烈士、革命军人家属与鳏、寡、孤、独户的困难。如官房村军属的十八亩代耕田，在抗旱中全部都车满了水。五十八岁的老太太孙金娣的二亩田，农民帮她一连车了七次水。
    长山乡的人民代表和干部这样关心人民的利益，他们也就更加得到全乡人民的爱戴和拥护。乡长陈关铨纠正了过去强迫命令的工作作风后，在普选中积极领导群众抢收抢种，目前又日夜的领导群众抗旱，在紧张的工作中，不再采取强迫命令的作法。人们说：陈乡长真是变样了。副乡长俞子龙在上新眺村领导群众抗旱时，带病日夜守在抽水机旁帮助拉轮子。农民们感动的说：这的确是人民的好乡长！人民代表朱阿明和杨正顺一天几次跑到十五里路以外的富阳城去请人修理抽水机，群众说：“阿明、正顺为了大家耽误了自己的生产，我们全村保证不让干了他的田。”
    由于新的乡人民政府的领导，长山乡的抗旱保秋斗争已经取得了重大的胜利。现在走进前山、栋山等村庄，一眼望去，田野里全是谷粒饱满的好庄稼。农民们都满面笑容地准备迎接新的丰收年成。
