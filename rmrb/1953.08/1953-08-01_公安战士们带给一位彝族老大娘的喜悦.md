    Public Security Fighters Bring Joy to an Yi Elderly Woman
    Letter from Ma Maozong of a Public Security Force unit in Xichang City, Xikang Province: In June, the fields of Puxiong area in Xikang Province were full of newly planted rice seedlings, but the land of an Yi elderly woman’s family was still bare, without a single seedling planted.

    It turned out that the Yi elderly woman's son, Erha, was injured in the leg from "fighting enemies" (this area was liberated relatively late and the People's Government had not yet been formally established, so the situation was different from other areas), and was lying down all day, groaning in pain. The elderly woman had found all the local medicines she knew to use for Erha, but his injuries were still very serious. She had also asked witch doctors several times, but of course, they didn't help. This was like a big stone pressing on the old woman's heart, and she had no mind to take care of her crops.

    One day, more than a dozen public security fighters stationed here came to the elderly woman's house. Some carried large bags embroidered with red crosses, and some carried farm tools. The fighters explained their purpose: "We heard that your son was injured in fighting enemies, and the rice seedlings haven't been planted yet; we are here to treat your son's injuries and plant rice seedlings for your family." The elderly woman listened to the fighters' words, staring blankly, with two hot tears falling from her eyes. After a long while, she said, "You—are people of Chairman Mao!" The fighters sat for a while, and after leaving two medical staff to apply medicine to Erha, the rest carried their farming tools and followed the elderly woman to the fields. At noon, the fighters were bending over, busily planting rice seedlings, and the elderly woman came from home carrying the cooked meal. She shouted, "Folks, come up and eat!" The fighters agreed while continuing to plant rice seedlings. The elderly woman shouted again, but the fighters still didn't move. "If you don't eat, you must at least take a break!" Still, not a single fighter wanted to rest. The elderly woman had no choice but to carry the meal back home. After the fighters finished planting her rice seedlings, they went straight back to their station. Half a month later, Erha was able to walk, and the rice seedlings in the elderly woman's field also grew.

    The elderly woman was so happy that she seemed several years younger, and she told everyone she met, "I have lived in Puxiong for fifty or sixty years, and I have never seen such a good army! Chairman Mao is really our great benefactor, a living Buddha, and I must go to Beijing to see him."

### 公安战士们带给一位彝族老大娘的喜悦

    公安战士们带给一位彝族老大娘的喜悦
    西康省西昌市公安部队某部马懋宗来信：六月里，西康省普雄地区的田野尽是新插的秧苗了，但是一位彝族老大娘家的地还光光的，一根苗也没栽下去。
    原来这位彝族老大娘的儿子耳哈因为“打冤家”（该地解放较迟，还没正式成立人民政府，所以情况和其他地区不一样。）被打伤了大腿，整天躺着，痛苦地呻吟着。老大娘把自己所知道的土药都找来给耳哈用过了，但他的伤势仍很沉重。她也请过好几次巫师，当然更不会起好作用。这像一块大石头压在大娘心上似的，她没有心肠去管她的庄稼。
    一天，在这里驻防的十多个公安战士到老大娘家来了。有的背着绣了红十字的大皮包，有的扛着农具。战士们说明来意：“我们听说你家儿子打冤家打伤了，秧子也没栽下去；我们就是为了给你儿子医伤，给你家栽秧子来的。”老大娘听了战士们的话，直愣愣地看着，眼眶里掉下了两颗热泪，半天才说出一句话：“你们——毛主席的人呗！”战士们坐了一会，除了留下两个卫生员给耳哈上药，其余的都扛着种地的家伙让老大娘领着下地去。晌午，战士们正弯着腰紧张地插秧，老大娘从家里背着做好的饭来了。她放开嗓子喊：“老乡，快上来吃饭了。”战士们一面答应，一面继续插秧。老大娘又喊，战士们还是不动。“你们不吃饭，也得歇一歇嘛！”仍然没有一个战士要歇。老大娘只好背着饭回去了。战士们给她插完了秧，便迳直回驻地去了。过了半个月，耳哈能行走了，老大娘田里的秧苗也长起来了。
    老大娘高兴得年青了几岁似地，逢人便说：“我在普雄活了五六十年，从来没见过这样好的军队啊！毛主席真是我们的大恩人，活菩萨，我总要到北京去看看他老人家。”
