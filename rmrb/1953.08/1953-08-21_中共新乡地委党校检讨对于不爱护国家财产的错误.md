    CPC Xinxiang Prefectural Committee Party School's Self-Criticism Regarding the Error of Not Cherishing State Property

    Letter from the CPC Xinxiang Prefectural Committee Party School: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on May 18th published a letter from reader Yang Chongming, criticizing our school for not cherishing state property, causing more than 100 tons of lime transported to Wuchang to become waste. This criticism is correct. This batch of lime was escorted to Wuchang last year by Jiao Lianshan, the former deputy manager of our school's production department, before the "Three-Anti" campaign. At that time, the "Three-Anti" campaign had just begun, the lime was not sold, and Jiao Lianshan was involved in corruption, so we transferred him back. The lime was stored at the station and fined several times; we then sent Pei Xusheng, a cadre from the General Affairs Section, to handle it. In addition to selling some of it, the rest was stored in an open space. After Pei Xusheng returned to school, he told Zheng Yaobi (a corrupt element during the "Three-Anti" campaign), the manager of the production department, about the situation, but did not report it to the higher-level leaders. Last June, we transferred all personnel and property of the agency's production to be received by the local financial committee and transferred to the Jiaozuo Sub-Prison. Later, neither we nor the Jiaozuo Sub-Prison inquired about this batch of lime. It was not until March of this year that the comrades from the Wuchang Transportation Company wrote to us to urge us to pay the wages for moving the lime that we contacted the Jiaozuo Sub-Prison again. In addition to paying the wages, the staff of the Jiaozuo Sub-Prison stationed in Wuchang were responsible for handling the matter. We did not cherish state property enough and should conduct a profound self-criticism. Zheng Yaobi and Jiao Lianshan, the former managers and deputy managers of the production department, have already been punished for corruption during the "Three-Anti" campaign; Pei Xusheng has made a public self-criticism and has been severely criticized, but will not be given administrative punishment.

### 中共新乡地委党校检讨对于不爱护国家财产的错误

    中共新乡地委党校检讨对于不爱护国家财产的错误
    中共新乡地委党校来信：五月十八日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了读者杨重明的来信，批评我校不爱护国家财产，使运到武昌的一百多吨石灰变成废物。这个批评是正确的。这批石灰是去年“三反”运动前我校前生产部副经理焦连山押运到武昌去的。当时刚好“三反”运动开始，石灰没有卖出，而焦连山有贪污行为，被我们调回。这批石灰在车站存着，被罚了几次款；我们就派总务科干部裴绪生前去处理，除卖掉一部分外，其余的就找了一个空地存下了。裴绪生返校后把情况告诉生产部经理郑耀弼（“三反”时的贪污分子），但没有向上级领导同志汇报。去年六月，我们将机关生产所有人员和财产移交，由当地财委交焦作分监狱接收。后来，我们和焦作分监狱对这批石灰都没有过问。直到今年三月，武昌搬运分公司的工人同志给我们来信催要搬石灰的工资，我们才再和焦作分监狱联系，除了付清工资外，并由焦作分监狱驻武昌工作人员负责处理这件事。我们对国家财产不够爱护，应该深刻检讨。和此事件的有关人员，前生产部正副经理郑耀弼、焦连山在“三反”运动中已因有贪污行为而受到处分；裴绪生已作了公开检讨，并受到严重批评，不再给予行政处分。
