    Central People's Government Ministry of Health
    Holds "Pavlovian Theory Study Session" in Beijing
    With the assistance of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies, the Central People's Government Ministry of Health is holding a "Pavlovian Theory Study Session" in Beijing starting August 21st. The session gathers more than 80 scholars from national universities and scientific research institutions in the fields of physiology and related disciplines, as well as psychology, to systematically study the advanced nervous activity theory of the great Soviet physiologist Pavlov.
    The opening ceremony of the study session was held on the morning of the 21st. Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Li Dequan, Minister of the Central People's Government Ministry of Health, and Vice Minister Wang Bin all attended the opening ceremony. President Guo Moruo delivered a speech lasting one and a half hours. Minister Li Dequan made a mobilization report. Zhao Yibing, Chairman of the Chinese Physiological Society, reported on the preparations on behalf of the preparatory committee of the study session and proposed a draft study plan. Finally, Hou Zonglian, Dean of Northwest Medical College, representing all the students, made a guarantee of studying with an open mind.
    Since the national liberation, advanced Soviet academic thought has entered China without hindrance. Studying Pavlovian theory, which serves as the guiding academic thought of Soviet medicine, physiology, and psychology, has become an eager demand of medical workers and physiology and psychology scholars in our country. Many medical colleges and scientific research institutions have seriously carried out studies. However, these studies lack unified organization and leadership, lack sufficient translated materials, and lack clear learning steps. Everyone can only conduct some fragmented and sporadic learning based on some scattered translated documents and articles published in newspapers and magazines, and cannot completely comprehend the essence of Pavlovian theory. In response to the above situation, this study session has determined three tasks: (1) To conduct systematic and in-depth study of Pavlov's classic works, so as to obtain the basic concepts and basic laws of Pavlovian theory, and lay the foundation for long-term learning in the future; (2) To proofread study materials and academic terms; (3) To formulate study and discussion outlines for reference by medical workers and relevant scientific workers across the country when studying.
    The study session is scheduled to last for one month. During this month, the students will mainly study the following four classic works under the guidance of the Academic Committee: "Lectures on the Function of the Cerebral Hemispheres" by Pavlov, "Twenty-Five Years of Objective Study of Higher Nervous Activity (Behavior) of Animals" by Pavlov, "The Cerebral Cortex and Internal Organs" by Academician Bykov, and "Introduction to the Pathophysiology of Higher Nervous Activity" by Ivanov-Smolensky. The Academic Committee is composed of 20 physiologists and psychologists, including Zhao Yibing, Ji Zhongpu, Shen Junqi, Zhang Xijun, Shen Jichun, Cai Qiao, Yan Derun, Hou Zonglian, Lin Shumu, Ding Zan, Xue Gongchuo, Cao Richang, Liu Minying, and Long Shuxiu. The learning method is mainly self-study, with group-based reading and discussion. Members of the Academic Committee will make central speeches during the discussions. They have already carried out two weeks of study in advance before the start of the session. The study session will also invite Soviet expert Alexandrov from the Central Ministry of Health to give a special report.
    After the visit of the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation to the Soviet Union, China's scientific community further realized the superiority of Soviet science, and the demand for learning advanced Soviet science has become even higher. The holding of this study session marks the beginning of a new stage in the study of Pavlovian theory in our country's scientific community. It is the first time for natural science workers in our country to systematically study advanced Soviet scientific academic thought by gathering scholars with advanced studies from all over the country.

    中央人民政府卫生部
    在北京举办“巴甫洛夫学说学习会”
    中央人民政府卫生部在中国科学院及中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会的协助下，二十一日起在北京举办“巴甫洛夫学说学习会”，集合全国高等学校及科学研究机关的生理学和有关学科以及心理学的学者八十多人系统地学习苏联伟大生理学家巴甫洛夫的高级神经活动学说。
    学习会在二十一日上午举行开学仪式。中国科学院院长郭沫若、中央人民政府卫生部部长李德全及副部长王斌都参加了开学仪式。郭沫若院长作了为时一小时半的演说。李德全部长作了动员报告。中国生理学会理事长赵以炳代表学习会的筹备委员会报告了筹备经过，并且提出了学习计划草案。最后，参加学习的西北医学院院长侯宗濂代表全体学员们提出了虚心学习的保证。
    全国解放以后，苏联的先进学术思想毫无阻碍地传入中国。学习作为苏联医学、生理学、心理学的主导学术思想的巴甫洛夫学说，已成为我国医务工作者及生理学、心理学学者如饥如渴的要求。许多医学院校及科学研究机构都已认真地进行了学习。但这些学习缺乏统一的组织领导，缺乏充分的中译资料以及没有明确的学习步骤。大家只能根据一些零星的翻译文献及报章杂志上刊载的文章进行一些片断的、零星的学习，还不能完整地领会巴甫洛夫学说的要义。这个学习会针对上述情况，确定了三项任务：（一）对巴甫洛夫的经典著作进行系统的深入的学习，使能得到巴甫洛夫学说的基本概念与基本规律，为今后长期学习打下基础；（二）校订学习资料和学术名词；（三）拟订学习讨论提纲，供全国医务工作者及有关科学工作者学习时参考。
    学习会预定学习时间为一个月。在这一个月中，学员们将在学委会的辅导下主要学习下列四部经典著作：巴甫洛夫著“大脑两半球机能讲义”、巴甫洛夫著“动物高级神经活动（行为）的二十五年客观研究”、贝可夫院士著“大脑皮层与内脏”及伊凡诺夫·斯莫连斯基著“高级神经活动病理生理学概论”。学委会由赵以炳、季钟朴、沈隽淇、张锡钧、沈霁春、蔡翘、阎德润、侯宗濂、林树模、丁瓒、薛公绰、曹日昌、刘民英、龙叔修等二十位生理学家及心理学家组成。学习的方法是以自学为主。以小组为单位进行阅读和讨论。讨论时由学委会的委员作中心发言。他们已在开学前预先进行了两星期的学习。学习会并将聘请中央卫生部的苏联专家亚历山大罗夫作专题报告。
    中国科学院访苏代表团访问苏联以后，我国科学界进一步体会了苏联科学的优越性，对学习苏联先进科学的要求更为高涨。这个学习会的举办，正是我国科学界学习巴甫洛夫学说开始进入
    一个新阶段的标志。像这样集中全国有深造的学者系统地学习苏联先进科学的学术思想，对我国自然科学工作者说来尚属首次。
