    Zhitkikh and Alexandrov
    By Li He, Special Correspondent for this newspaper in Moscow
    At the Red Hill Woolen Textile United Factory, I met Comrade Zhitkikh, the initiator of the Soviet competition to produce only superior quality products. He has been a worker for thirty-one years.
    Zhitkikh's initiative is not unfamiliar to us. The matter dates back four years. This worker, born into a textile worker's family and starting as a factory apprentice, was then a deputy foreman (that is, the head of a production team) in the weaving workshop, and was also elected as a representative of the Moscow City Soviet. At that time, the City Soviet faced the issue of improving the quality of products in industrial enterprises. Zhitkikh wrote in his notes: "Today, the issue of product quality has become decisive. Defective products should change from an unpleasant but unavoidable phenomenon to an unacceptable one. Our people need the best things, so we cannot reconcile ourselves not only to defective products, but also to second-class and third-class products." In order to know the sales situation of the Red Hill factory's products, he went to the store to investigate. He observed that buyers liked superior quality cloth. He learned from the shop assistants that good cloth sold out quickly, while inferior cloth took a long time to sell. He also confirmed from the customers' opinion book that people demanded superior quality products. Therefore, he mobilized and organized his own production team to fight for producing only superior quality products. This initiative quickly developed into a nationwide competition in the Soviet Union.
    Zhitkikh now does not relax his attention to the issue of product quality. He said that the competition to produce only superior quality products is deepening year by year. Taking the Red Hill factory as an example, when the competition started in 1949, superior quality products accounted for 75 percent, which increased by 10 percent after a year, and now accounts for 92.5 percent. He believes that the key to ensuring the production of superior quality products is, on the one hand, to constantly explain to the workers, most importantly to the workers in the production team, to improve their level of awareness, and on the other hand, to improve the workers' technical level through the education network. He said that Soviet industrial enterprises maintain close contact with each other, introduce new experiences to each other, and do not keep the experience to themselves, so the content of the socialist competition is constantly enriched.
    Zhitkikh is now a technical foreman, responsible for protecting 200 looms. I asked him for his opinion on a passage in the Labor Daily editorial. This passage said that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union criticized the shortcomings of formalism in the past leadership of the competition, and pointed out that it was wrong to encourage workers to be responsible for machine tools and equipment and to carry out "socialist protection," because this diverted the attention of the masses from the basic tasks of the competition and reduced the sense of responsibility of the leaders who should be responsible. Zhitkikh also believes that the past practice of encouraging workers to be responsible for protecting their own machine tools was wrong. Because this caused the workshop director and foreman to abandon their responsibilities and dispersed the workers' strength; and the machine was originally in charge of a special person (for example, he was responsible for 200 machine tools to the workshop director), if the worker is also responsible, it will mess up the special person responsible system. He said: "The protection of equipment should be the responsibility of one person instead of a hundred people, which would be more difficult."
    The weaving factory where Zhitkikh is located is the production unit that holds the winning mobile red flag in the Red Hill Woolen Textile United Factory (the United Factory includes spinning mills, weaving factories, and finishing factories). The weaving factory has two workshops - the preparation workshop, the weaving workshop, and the product inspection department. The weaving workshop is the most advanced. I spoke with Comrade Alexandrov, the director of this workshop.
    Alexandrov first talked about how he became the director of the workshop.
    The weaving workshop has three work areas. Alexandrov goes to work at 8:30 a.m. every day. Sometimes he arrives earlier due to work needs. He goes to the first work area, where women's suit wool is woven. He looks at the machine tools, talks with the workers and deputy foreman, and understands the condition of the machine tools, warp threads, and so on. Problems that can be solved on the spot are solved at that time. Then he goes to the second work area, where serge is woven. He talks with the workers and deputy foreman in the same way. He writes down problems that cannot be solved on the spot in his notebook, so that they can be solved later. Then he passes through the preparation workshop to understand the situation of the yarn there, whether there is enough yarn for two or three days. Then he goes to the third work area, where a fully modified automatic loom is located. He understands the situation in the same way. Then he goes to the product inspection department to inquire about the quality of the products from the inspectors, and notes which machine tools produced substandard products. Finally, he goes to the dispatch room of the weaving factory, where statisticians provide materials on various production situations, such as worker attendance rate, daily output, variety, and quality. This round of inspection takes an average of two hours, which gives him a general understanding of the workshop's situation on that day, so that he can arrange the work.
    After Alexandrov returns to his office, he first solves the problems that cannot be solved next to the machine tool. He summons relevant personnel to discuss. If it is related to the machine, he finds the technical foreman who works in the same office to jointly study the cause and solution. If there is a shortage of certain materials or things, he calls the factory supply department, or directly finds the director of the factory.
    Alexandrov often has to talk with many workers, deputy foremen, and foremen. Sometimes he calls all the people in the entire production team to talk, pointing out shortcomings and ways to improve them, and each talk does not exceed fifteen minutes. In addition, he also organizes worker meetings, using the time when workers eat lunch to talk to workers about production issues, competition summaries, and even the international situation. Most of the meetings are held during the day. Because the factory works in three shifts, workers work the day shift one week and the night shift the next week, they can take turns to participate. However, worker meetings are also held at night when necessary.
    Alexandrov begins to process the workers' application slips after 1:00 p.m. every day. He also pays attention to whether the workers attend classes regularly, how the technical and cultural studies are going, what the technical safety situation is, and which rationalization proposals have been implemented. The factory director, chief engineer, and factory director often come to him to inquire about the workshop's situation. As the workshop director, he must be familiar with all aspects of the entire workshop and all the workers in the workshop.
    Alexandrov formulates monthly, ten-day, and one-day production plans according to the production plan given to him by the higher authorities, including output, superior quality products, and the number of workers in each aspect (the weaving workshop starts a monthly plan from the beginning of the month, and the preparation workshop starts a monthly plan from the 23rd of the previous month). The production plan is summarized every ten days. The weaving factory has a statistics department, which summarizes the achievements of each worker and production team according to the workers' registered accounts. When Alexandrov finds any shortcomings in these ten days from the summary, he pays attention to correcting these shortcomings in the next ten days. Ninety-four to ninety-seven percent of the workers in the two workshops of the weaving factory complete or exceed the production plan every ten days, and only a very small number of unskilled novices have not completed the plan. Alexandrov is particularly busy on the 30th, 1st, and 2nd of each month, because he has to summarize the plan completion situation and provide the accounting department with a detailed list for calculating workers' wages.
    Alexandrov then talked about the workshop's system of personal responsibility.
    The factory director introduced to me: the Red Hill United Factory has a factory director, a first deputy factory director who is also the chief engineer, a second deputy factory director who manages the economy, and below are the directors of spinning, weaving, finishing and other factories, workshop directors, foremen, deputy foremen, etc. Alexandrov described the administrative system of the workshop. The administrative system of the weaving workshop is as follows: workshop director - work shift foreman (the weaving workshop has three work areas, and works in three shifts day and night, with nine foremen) - deputy foreman (that is, the head of the production team) - worker. The workshop director also leads the technical foreman and the technical foreman, who work during the day. There are also repair foremen and fitters, who are under the leadership of the factory's chief mechanic and not under the leadership of the workshop director, and they overhaul the machine tools according to the plan once every quarter, and overhaul the machine tools once every three years. The work area also has odd-job auxiliary workers, who are under the leadership of the work shift foreman and not under the leadership of the deputy foreman (the head of the production team).
    The workshop director is responsible for completing the workshop's overall production plan, variety plan, superior quality product plan, and labor productivity plan, and is responsible for equipment, raw materials, and technical safety. The workshop director pays attention to the coordination of various aspects of work in the workshop, and he has the right to dispatch workers in the workshop. In the same aspects, the work shift foreman is responsible for one work area, and the deputy foreman is responsible for one production team. The technical foreman is responsible for technical aspects, such as ensuring the normal operation of the machine and the supply of parts, but does not manage administration. Under such a system of responsibility, the production order of the workshop is well-organized.
    The workshop pays great attention to technical safety. The workshop has technical safety rules. On the first day of work for new workers or workers transferred to new positions, the work shift foreman is responsible for giving them an education on technical safety rules. In addition, all workers receive a technical safety education once a quarter. This review is to prevent workers from forgetting old knowledge and accepting new knowledge. The requirements for technical safety equipment are stipulated in the collective contract. If an accident occurs, the workshop director must sign and be responsible. The entire factory has a special engineer, who is responsible for inspecting and supervising the technical safety of each workshop under the leadership of the chief engineer.
    The workshop also has a set of systems to ensure the production of superior quality products. The inspectors of the workshop's product inspection department inspect every piece of cloth and do not let go of any shortcomings. When substandard cloth is found, the foreman and deputy foreman study the cause together and try to overcome it. Through the inspectors, it can be found which machine tool and which worker produced the substandard cloth. The results of the inspection are recorded on each worker's registered account every day. A social inspection of products is held once a week, which is inspected by the heads of administration, the Party, the trade union, and advanced workers. In addition, in order to prevent the generation of substandard cloth, there are also special inspectors directly under the leadership of the workshop director, who use magnifying glasses to inspect unfinished products on the loom.
    The talks with Comrade Zhitkikh and Comrade Alexandrov made me realize that it is not accidental that the Red Hill United Factory can manufacture superior quality woolen cloth for 13,000 people every day.

    朱特基赫和亚历山得罗夫
    本报驻莫斯科特派记者  李何
    在红岗毛织联合工厂，我遇见了苏联只出产优等质量产品竞赛首创人朱特基赫同志。他已经当了三十一年工人。
    朱特基赫的创举，对于我们不是生疏的。事情回到四年前。这位出生于纺织工人家庭，从工厂的打杂学徒做起的工人，当时当了织布车间的一个副领班（就是生产组组长），同时被选为莫斯科市苏维埃代表。当时市苏维埃面对着工业企业提高产品质量问题。朱特基赫在自己的笔记上写道：“今天关于产品的质量问题已经成为有决定意义的了。废品应该从不愉快却不可避免的现象变为不可允许的现象。我们的人们需要最好的东西，因此不仅同废品，而且同二等品、三等品，都不能调和。”为了知道红岗工厂产品销售的情形，他到商店去调查。他观察到购买者喜欢上等布。他从店员口中知道好布一下子就销光，而次布很久卖不出去。他从购买者的意见簿上也证实人民要求优等产品。因此他动员和组织自己生产组为只出产优等产品而斗争。这个创举很快发展成了全苏联的竞赛。
    朱特基赫现在不放松对产品质量问题的注意。他说，只出产优等质量产品的竞赛一年年深入了。以红岗工厂为例，一九四九年竞赛开始时，优等产品占百分之七十五，过了一年提高了百分之十，现在占百分之九十二·五。他认为，保证出产优等质量产品的关键，一方面是经常向工人解释，最要紧的是向生产组里的工人解释，提高工人的觉悟水平，另一方面是经过教育网，提高工人的技术水平。他说，苏联的工业企业彼此保持着密切的联系，互相介绍新的经验，不把经验据为自己的，所以社会主义竞赛的内容不断地丰富着。
    朱特基赫现在是技术领班，负责保护二百台织布机。我请教了他对于劳动报社论上一段话的意见。这段话说，苏联共产党中央委员会批评了过去领导竞赛中形式主义的缺点，指出了鼓励工人对车床、设备负责，进行“社会主义保护”，是不对的，因为这使群众的注意力离开了竞赛的基本任务，而使理应负责的领导人减低了责任心。朱特基赫也认为，过去鼓励工人对自己的车床负责保护的作法是不对的。因为这样造成了车间主任、领班放弃责任，使工人的力量分散；而且机器本来有专人负责（例如他向车间主任负责二百台车床），如果工人也负责，反而弄乱了专人负责制。他说：“设备的保护应由一个专人而不是由一百个人负责，那样反而难办。”
    朱特基赫所在的织布厂，是红岗毛织联合工厂中掌握优胜流动红旗的生产单位（联合工厂包括纺纱厂、织布厂、整理厂）。织布厂有两个车间——准备车间、织布车间和产品检查处。织布车间是最先进的。我和这个车间的主任亚历山得罗夫同志谈了话。
    亚历山得罗夫首先谈了他怎样当车间主任。
    织布车间有三个工房。亚历山得罗夫每天上午八点半钟上班。有时由于工作需要，早到一些。他走到第一工房，那里织造女西装毛布。看看车床，和工人、副领班谈谈，了解车床、经线等等情况。就地能解决的问题当时就解决了。接着走到第二工房，那里织造哔叽呢。同样和工人、副领班谈谈。把就地不能解决的问题记在本子上，以便随后解决。接着路过准备车间，了解那里纱的情况，纱够不够两三天用。接着走到第三工房，那里有一间完全改装了自动织布机。同样了解一下情况。然后走到产品检查处，询问检查员产品的质量如何，记下那些车床出了次货。最后走到织布厂的调度室，那里有统计员提供各种生产情况的材料，如像工人出勤率、一昼夜产量、品种、质量。这样巡视一遍，平均花两个钟头，对于当天车间情况有一个大体的了解，好布置工作。
    亚历山得罗夫回到办公室后，首先解决在车床旁边不能解决的问题。召来有关的人员商量。如果和机器有关，就找在一起办公的技术领班来共同研究出原因和处理的办法。如果短缺某种材料或东西，就打电话给工厂供给科，或者直接找本厂主任。
    亚历山得罗夫经常要和许多工人、副领班、领班谈话。有时把整个生产组的人都召集来谈谈，指出缺点和改进的办法，每次谈话最多不超过十五分钟。此外，还组织工人会议，利用工人吃午饭时候，一边向工人谈生产问题、竞赛总结，以至国际形势。会议多半在白天进行。因为工厂分三班工作，工人们一周值日班另一周值夜班，都可以轮流参加。但必要时夜班也举行工人会议。
    亚历山得罗夫在每天下午一点钟以后开始处理本车间工人们的申请条子。他还注意工人们是否经常上课，技术和文化学习进行得怎样，技术安全情形如何，那些合理化建议实现了。厂长、总工程师、厂主任时常找他去询问车间情况。作为车间主任，他对于全车间和全车间工人的各方面都要熟悉。
    亚历山得罗夫根据上级给他的生产计划，制订一月、一旬和一天的生产计划，包括产量、优等品、工人数目各个方面（织布车间从月初，准备车间从上月二十三日开始一个月计划）。生产计划每十天总结一次。织布厂有统计科，它根据工人的记名账总结每个工人和生产组的成绩。亚历山得罗夫从总结上发现这十天有什么缺点时，后十天就注意纠正这些缺点。织布厂两个车间百分之九十四到九十七的工人每旬都完成或超过生产计划，只有极少数不熟练的新手没有完成计划。亚历山得罗夫在每月三十日、一日、二日特别忙，因为要总结计划完成的情形，要提供会计科计算工人工资的明细表。
    亚历山得罗夫其次谈了车间的专人负责制。
    厂长向我介绍过：红岗联合工厂有厂长、第一副厂长也就是总工程师、管理经济的第二副厂长，以下是纺纱、织布、整理等厂主任、车间主任、领班、副领班等等。亚历山得罗夫叙述了车间的行政系统。织布车间的行政系统是这样的：车间主任——工作班领班（织布车间三个工房，日夜分三班工作，有九个领班）——副领班（就是生产组组长）——工人。车间主任还领导技术领班长和技术领班，他们在白天工作。还有修理领班和钳工，受工厂总机械师而不受车间主任领导，他们每季按照计划预修车床一次，三年大修车床一次。工房还有打杂的辅助工人，受工作班领班领导而不受副领班（生产组组长）领导。
    车间主任负责完成车间生产总计划、品种计划、优等品计划、劳动生产率计划，负责设备、原料、技术安全。车间主任注意车间内各方面工作的协调合拍，他有权调度本车间内的工人。在同样各方面，工作班领班负责一个工房，副领班负责一个生产组。技术领班负责技术方面，如像保证机器的正常开动、零件的供给，但不管行政。在这样的负责制度下，车间的生产秩序是有条不紊的。
    车间非常注意技术安全。车间有技术安全规则。新进厂的工人或者调动到新岗位的工人，上工的第一天，就由工作班领班负责给予一次技术安全规则的教育。此外，全体工人每季要受一次技术安全教育。这种复习是为了使工人不忘记旧的和接受新的知识。对于技术安全设备的要求，订在集体合同上。如果发生事故，车间主任要签字负责。全工厂有一个专门的工程师，他在总工程师领导下负责检查监督各车间的技术安全。
    车间对于保证出产优等产品，也有一套制度。车间的产品检查处的检查员检查每一匹布，不放过任何缺点。发现次布时，领班和副领班一起研究原因，设法克服。通过检查员可以发现哪一个车床哪一个工人出产了次布。每天在每个工人的记名账上记上检查的结果。每周举行一次产品的社会检查，由行政、党、工会的负责人和先进工人检查。此外，为了预防次布的产生，还有在车间主任直接领导下的专门检查员，在织布机上用放大镜检查未成品。
    朱特基赫同志和亚历山得罗夫同志的谈话，使我认识到，红岗联合工厂每天能制造一万三千人穿的优等毛布，不是偶然的。
