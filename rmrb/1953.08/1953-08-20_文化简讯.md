    Northeast Film Studio Recently Filmed and Translated Six New Films
    The new films recently filmed by the Northeast Film Studio of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government include the feature films "Harvest," "People of the Prairie," and "The Story of Marriage." In addition, in order to film the large-scale documentary "Northeast Forest," a working group went to the Lesser Khingan Mountains in mid-April to collect materials about the forest. At the beginning of June, the group went to Yichun and other places to film seasonal shots of rafting, river departure, and nurseries.
    The new films recently translated by Dongying include the Korean feature film "Defend Our Homeland," the Soviet color feature film "Road to Life," and the Romanian feature film "Ideal Realized" (also known as "Mitrea Cocor"). "Defend Our Homeland" is a feature film about the Korean people's struggle to defend their homeland and happy life. "Road to Life" specifically demonstrates how the Soviet Communist Party cultivates the excellent moral qualities and correct labor attitudes of Soviet youth. "Ideal Realized" is a film depicting the experience and life of Romanian peasants from being oppressed and exploited to taking control of the government after liberation.
    Zhejiang Peasants Welcome Film Projection Teams
    The Zhejiang Film Projection Team has gone to the plains areas of Jinhua, Zhuji, and other places, as well as the remote mountainous areas of Lishui, Wenzhou, and other places to screen films for farmers. The farmers expressed a very warm welcome to the film projection teams. Mountainous farmers are particularly interested in movies, and many have never seen a movie in their entire lives. After watching the movie, they sincerely thanked the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for caring so much about their lives.
    In order to further improve rural film projection work, the film projection team has opened a training class for projection team members, absorbing more than 100 students to study, many of whom are young women. In February of this year, the film projection team independently established a projection team named after "March 8th" and composed of female members. At present, the Zhejiang Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau is creating pilot experience in establishing management stations and fixed rural screenings in the Ningbo Special Zone, preparing to have a film management station in each special zone to specifically guide the screening work in the special zone; and plans to strive to achieve an average of one fixed screening team per county this winter, regularly conducting mobile screenings in various districts and townships in the county.
    Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Opera Reform Committee Selects a Batch of Cantonese Opera Performance Programs for the Second Half of the Year
    The Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Opera Reform Committee established a "Cantonese Opera Program Selection Group" in early May this year to conduct preliminary sorting of Cantonese opera programs. This selection of programs was carried out by combining top-down and bottom-up methods, mobilizing Cantonese opera artists to participate. The Opera Reform Committee collected about 2,800 old and new programs from all aspects for research, and selected a preliminary draft list for discussion by various troupes. A total of fourteen troupes, one theater, and one veteran artist participated in the selection work. The Cantonese Opera Program Selection Group of the Opera Reform Committee also included 26 veteran artists, 12 playwrights, and 1 Cantonese music master.
    Through gathering, analysis, research, and discussion, a list of Cantonese opera (ancient costume drama section) performance programs for the second half of the year was finally formulated, including 107 short programs, 111 long programs, and 62 temporary performance programs. These programs are not yet perfect and need further sorting. To this end, the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Opera Reform Committee convened a meeting of representatives of various Cantonese opera troupes, requesting them to attach importance to this draft list, use it as a reference and basis for tentatively formulating the performance plan for the second half of the year; and hoping that the Cantonese opera circles, in addition to selecting programs from the ancient costume drama performance program list, will strive to create conditions to stage original and new modern dramas that reflect the struggle life of the people.

    浙江农民欢迎电影工作队
    浙江省电影工作队曾经先后到金华、诸暨等平原地带和丽水、温州等偏僻山区去对农民放映。农民们对电影队表示十分欢迎。特别是山区农民对电影更感兴趣，很多人一辈子都没有看过电影。看了电影后，他们衷心地感谢共产党和毛主席这样关心他们的生活。
    为进一步作好农村电影放映工作，电影工作队开办了一个放映队员训练班，吸收了一百多个学员进行学习，其中有很多人是女青年。今年二月电影工作队就已单独成立了一个以“三八”命名，由女队员组成的放映队。目前浙江省文化事业管理局正在宁波专区创造建立管理站和农村固定放映的试点工作经验，准备做到每一专区有一个电影管理站，具体指导本专区放映工作；并计划在今年冬季争取作到平均每一县有一个固定放映小队，经常在本县各区乡作巡回放映。
    广东省、广州市戏曲改革委员会选订一批下半年粤剧上演节目
    广东省、广州市戏曲改革委员会在今年五月初成立“选订粤剧剧目小组”，进行粤剧剧目的初步整理工作。这次选订剧目工作，是采取了自上而下和自下而上相结合的方法，发动粤剧艺人一起进行的。由戏曲改革委员会从各方面采集了约二千八百个新旧剧目加以研究，选订初步草单交给各剧团讨论，共有十四个剧团、一个戏院和一个老艺人参加选订工作。在戏曲改革委员会的选订剧目小组中，也有老艺人二十六人、编剧家十二人、粤乐家一人参加。
    通过汇集、分析、研究和讨论，最后制订了今年下半年粤剧（古装戏部分）上演剧目单，包括短剧目一○七个，长剧目一一一个和暂演剧目六十二个。这些剧目，并不是已经十分完善，需要进一步进行整理。广东省、广州市戏曲改革委员会为此曾召集各粤剧团代表开会，要求重视这一草单，以此为参考和依据，试订下半年的上演计划；并希望粤剧界在古装戏的上演剧目单上选择剧目以外，要努力创造条件，上演原有的和创作新的表现现代人民斗争生活的时装戏。
