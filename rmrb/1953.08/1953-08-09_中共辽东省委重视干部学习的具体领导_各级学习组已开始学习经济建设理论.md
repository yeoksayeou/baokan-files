The Liaodong Province's on-the-job cadres in the senior and middle-level groups began studying "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" successively in July. The junior groups began studying "Reader on Common Knowledge of Economic Construction" in early August.

    The Liaodong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to this study of economic construction theory. In order to solve the teaching problems of the junior groups, the Provincial Committee had planned to hold a training class for instructors of common knowledge of economic construction at the Party School six months ago. The trainees of this training class had already graduated and returned to various cities and counties to participate in work. From the beginning of July, the Provincial Committee also held a teacher training class for the first and second chapters of common knowledge of economic construction. Recently, the Provincial Committee also organized a lecturer group for the junior groups composed of fourteen people. In order to solve the problem of lecturing on "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" for the middle-level groups, the Provincial Committee recently established a part-time lecturer group consisting of more than twenty people. The lecturer group is divided into four groups, responsible for lecturing on Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" respectively. In order to enable this study to be carried out in a planned manner and to take into account the different cultural and theoretical levels and business nature of cadres in various positions, different learning contents and requirements were stipulated. On June 10, the Provincial Committee issued a detailed plan for implementing the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Theoretical Education of Cadres in 1953-1954." In addition to instructing all localities to complete the compilation of grade standards within a certain period, the plan also instructed all levels to "take a step ahead" level by level, high, middle, and junior, before learning, so that the upper level can guide the learning of the lower level, with special emphasis on: strengthening the theoretical learning of the senior groups is the central link in implementing the central instructions. The Provincial Committee also stipulated that the senior and middle-level studies must organize core groups to implement peer tutoring, and the core groups of the senior groups must hold a research meeting every half month to study the key points and requirements of each chapter and other related issues. Each county must also take the county party committee as the center and organize core groups to tutor the learning of the junior groups. The Provincial Committee also instructed that the core groups at all levels must formulate practical learning plans based on specific circumstances, and summarize after learning each chapter or section. Senior group students must take exams, write essays, etc. It is also stipulated that the Theoretical Education Department should regularly send people to each group to check the implementation of the learning plan.

    Regarding the study of economic construction theory by factory and mine cadres, it is of particular importance. However, due to the weak theoretical education foundation of factory and mine cadres in the province, the Provincial Committee instructed that a steady and focused approach should be adopted for the time being. Before July, it only started in larger factories and mines with more than 1,000 employees. Factories and mines that organize theoretical study for the first time only organize "Common Knowledge of Economic Construction" self-study groups among cadres above the section and stock level with a junior high school education or above, gradually establish systems, strengthen tutoring, and then expand the scope after their learning is consolidated. The Provincial Committee instructed that all factories and mines must not only equip necessary study tutors, but also make the greatest determination to equip full-time theoretical teachers of considerable quality at a ratio of one teacher for every 300 students.

    In view of the fact that the ideological trend of neglecting commercial work still seriously exists among trade personnel, the Provincial Committee specially stipulated that two months should be spent continuing to study relevant commercial theories and policies in order to enhance their understanding of the importance of trade work, and then organize the study of "Common Knowledge of Economic Construction" after the end of this study.

    Technical personnel and staff in the health department generally still focus on political study aimed at ideological transformation for the time being.

    As for district-level cadres, because most of them do not yet have a junior high school education, it was decided that the current focus should be on learning culture, and policy study focusing on the three documents of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on rural work.

    In addition, for the theoretical learning problems of cadres at all levels, especially cadres in county-level agencies who often go to the countryside to work, the Provincial Committee specifically instructed the leading cadres of each unit to pay special attention to them. While organizing them to go to the countryside to work, they should assign them learning tasks; when checking their work, they should also check their learning, commend the good, criticize the bad, and resolutely correct the laissez-faire attitude of cadres going to the countryside towards theoretical learning.

### 中共辽东省委重视干部学习的具体领导  各级学习组已开始学习经济建设理论

    中共辽东省委重视干部学习的具体领导
    各级学习组已开始学习经济建设理论
    辽东省在职干部高、中级组的“联共（布）党史”学习，已在七月份先后开始了。初级组在八月初开始学习“经济建设常识读本”。
    中共辽东省委对这次经济建设理论的学习极为重视。为解决初级组的教学问题，在半年前省委就曾有计划地在党校举办了经济建设常识辅导员训练班，该训练班的学员早已毕业回到各市、县参加工作。从七月上旬起省委又举办了经济建设常识第一、二章的教员训练班。最近时期省委还组织了一个由十四人组成的初级组讲师团。为解决中级组学习“联共（布）党史”的讲课问题，省委最近又成立了一个包括二十余人的兼职讲师团。讲师团分四个小组，分别担任“联共（布）党史”第九至第十二章的讲授。为使这次学习能有计划地进行，并能照顾各个岗位干部不同的文化理论水平和业务性质而规定了不同的学习内容和要求。省委在六月十日就发出了执行“中共中央关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”的详细计划。计划中除指示各地在一定时期内完成编级标准外，并指示各级在学习之前，必须依高、中、初逐级“先走一步”，以便能够使上一级指导下一级的学习，其中特别强调：加强高级组的理论学习是贯彻中央指示的中心环节。省委还规定高、中级的学习，都必须组织核心组，实行同级辅导，而高级组的核心组必须每半月开一次研究会，研究每章的重点和要求以及其他有关问题。各县也必须以县委为中心，组织核心组以辅导初级组的学习。省委还指示各级核心组均须根据具体情况，订出切实可行的学习计划，每学完一章或一段落后都必须总结。高级组学员必须进行考试、写心得等。并规定理论教育处要经常派人到各组检查执行学习计划的情况。
    关于厂矿干部学习经济建设理论，更有特别重要的意义。但由于目前该省厂矿干部理论教育基础薄弱，省委指示暂时仍采取稳步前进，重点组织的方针。在七月以前仅在有员工千人以上的较大厂矿开始。初次组织理论学习的厂矿，只在有初中毕业以上文化程度的科、股长以上干部中组织“经济建设常识”自修组，逐渐建立制度、加强辅导，待其学习巩固后，再行扩大范围。省委指示各厂矿除必须配备必要的学习辅导员外，并下最大决心按三百名学员一名教员的比例，配备相当质量的专职理论教员。
    贸易人员的理论学习，鉴于目前还严重存在着轻视商业工作的思想，省委特规定以两个月的时间继续学习有关商业的理论和政策，以提高他们对贸易工作重要性的认识，待此项学习结束之后，再组织“经济建设常识”的学习。
    卫生部门的技术人员及工作人员，一般仍暂时以进行思想改造为目的的政治学习为主。
    至于区级干部由于大部都还不够初中文化程度，决定目前以学文化为主，并以中共中央关于农村工作的三个文件为主的政策学习。
    此外，对于各级机关，特别是对于县级机关中经常下乡工作的干部的理论学习问题，省委特指示各该单位的领导干部应特别加以重视。在组织他们下乡工作的同时，要布置给他们学习任务；检查工作时应同时检查学习，表扬好的，批评坏的，切实纠正下乡干部对理论学习采取放任自流的态度。
