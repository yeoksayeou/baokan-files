    From the Investigation Materials of Xixia Village, See the Important Position of Handicraft Production in Rural Areas
    Huang Sha
    In Fujian, where industry is underdeveloped and transportation is inconvenient, handicrafts still play an extremely important role in agricultural production and farmers' lives. After a preliminary investigation and understanding of Xixia Village, Jingxi Township, Seventh District, Minhou: At present, among all the production and living materials of farmers, handicrafts account for the largest proportion, except for agricultural products. Of the things farmers buy, handicrafts account for about 70%.
    Xixia Village has 89 households and 422 people (34 of whom are working elsewhere), 710.02 mu of land, and 33 head of cattle (11 of which are calves and cannot yet plow the fields). Farmers mainly rely on agricultural income to maintain their livelihoods. In today's rural areas where the small-scale peasant economy accounts for the vast majority, in terms of production, in addition to land, cattle, agricultural fertilizers, and seeds, and in terms of life, in addition to grain and firewood, handicrafts account for about 70% of the production and living materials that need to be purchased, industrial products (mainly commercial fertilizers) account for about 20%, and other items (mainly kerosene and salt) account for about 10%. The most important agricultural tools are: hoe, sickle, grass rake, reed knife, plow, harrow, rake carrier, mountain hoe, grass knife (all iron), waterwheel, rice flail, windmill, urine bucket, manure carrier (all wood), shoulder pole (wood or bamboo), bamboo basket, bamboo scraper, dustpan, earth basket (all bamboo), palm coat, palm apron, and burlap bag, etc., a total of 22 kinds, all of which are handicrafts. Farmers would not be able to produce at all without these handmade farm tools. Except for the Su Zeqing Agricultural Production Cooperative which has a threshing machine (awarded by the Minhou Commissioner's Office, now damaged and unusable), none of the farm tools in the village are machine-made industrial products. According to the villagers Dong Baodi, Chen Chuanwang, Su Yimei, and others: at least one-third of commonly used farm tools such as hoes, sickles, grass rakes, reed knives, and bamboo baskets need to be repaired every year; since liberation, each farmer has used an average of at least 100 jin of grain per year to repair farm tools, and this repair is also done by hand. On the other hand, since farmers have only recently been emancipated and there are still some difficulties in production and life, it is not easy to add large farm tools such as waterwheels, windmills, plows, and harrows for the time being. Therefore, in the nearly four years since liberation, the number of windmills in the village is still 26 as before liberation, and only one manual waterwheel has been added. Only the number of commonly used farm tools such as hoes, grass rakes, and sickles has increased by about 10%. This shows that handmade farm tools will not only have a very important position along with the further development of agricultural production but also have a certain room for development.
    In addition to farm tools, most of the production tools and living utensils of farmers in Xixia Village are also handicrafts. These can be roughly divided into five categories. The first category is iron products, including about 15 kinds such as axes, firewood knives, kitchen knives, pots, saws, pliers, and scissors; the second category is wood products, including about 18 kinds such as tables, stools, beds, buckets, cabinets, boxes, and grain bins; the third category is bamboo products, including about 12 kinds such as ladders, mats, chopsticks, steamers, baskets, fish scoops, and grain bins; the fourth category is pottery and porcelain utensils, including about 12 kinds such as bowls, plates, cups, spoons, jars, pots, and vats; the fifth category is other daily utensils that do not belong to the above four categories, including about 10 kinds such as tin teapots, copper pipes, umbrellas, and combs. Only a few households have purchased industrial products such as thermos bottles, fountain pens, and flashlights. These situations show that practical handicrafts are also indispensable in rural areas at present, and these things cannot be replaced by large industrial products in a short period of time.
    In the current rural areas, farmers and handicraftsmen are closely integrated, and agricultural production and handicraft production are also inseparable. Twenty-six farmers in Xixia Village also do handicrafts, which greatly helps their family life. Poor peasant Su Minglang also works as a carpenter, doing carpentry work in the village or other villages for about 200 days a year, with a wage income of more than 1,000 jin of rice, exceeding one-half of his agricultural income. The villagers also often invite blacksmiths and bamboo craftsmen from other villages to repair farm tools and furniture. This spring, two bamboo craftsmen from Guangming Township worked in the village for seventy or eighty days. This kind of on-the-spot production fully reflects the characteristics of a small-scale peasant economy.
    The main consumer goods of farmers in Xixia Village are also handicrafts. At present, handicrafts account for about half of the cloth, salt, cooking oil, kerosene, towels, and other items purchased by farmers in the village, industrial products account for about 30%, and other items (mainly salt and kerosene) account for about 20%. Due to the continuous improvement of agricultural production after liberation, the living standards of farmers have also been continuously improved. Many farmers have begun to buy fine cloth such as Longtou cloth to make clothes, and some individual farmers have also purchased industrial products such as wool yarn and machine-made towels. The market for this kind of consumer handicraft products has a tendency to gradually shrink. On the one hand, this of course shows the gradual development of industry in our country, but on the other hand, it also reflects a serious problem existing in the province's handicraft production: poor quality and high cost. For example, some farmers in Xixia Village reported that the price difference between Longtou fine cloth and native cloth is not much. If native cloth (referring to those with good quality) were not more durable, everyone would wear fine cloth. This is a problem that needs attention. Another situation is that with the improvement of people's awareness and cultural level, superstition and waste in rural areas have been greatly reduced. Therefore, it is estimated that the consumption of superstitious articles in Xixia Village has decreased by about 90% compared with before liberation, and is still continuing to decrease. This shows that superstitious handicraft workers can only have a future by changing careers.

    从溪下村的调查材料看手工业生产在农村中的重要地位
    黄沙
    在工业不发达、交通不方便的福建，手工业品在农业生产和农民生活中，目前还起着极为重要的作用。我到闽侯七区荆溪乡溪下村初步调查了解：目前农民的全部生产和生活资料中，除农产品外，手工业品所占比重最大。农民所购买的东西，手工业品约占百分之七十。
    溪下村有八十九户、四百二十二人（其中三十四人外出），田地七百十亩零二厘，耕牛三十三头（其中十一头小牛现在还不能耕田），农民主要依靠农业收入维持生活。在农村小农经济占绝大比重的今天，农民在生产上除了田地、耕牛、农业肥料、种籽，生活上除了粮食、柴草外，需要购买的生产和生活资料中，手工业品约占百分之七十，工业品（主要是商品肥料）约占百分之二十，其他（主要是火油和食盐）约占百分之十。生产工具中最主要的农具，溪下村约有锄、镰刀、草耙、堘刀、犁、耙、耙搭、山锄、草刀（以上铁制）、水车、稻楻、风车、尿桶、粪楻（以上木制）、扁挑（木制或竹制）、竹?、箂、簸箕、土箕（以上竹制）、棕衣、棕围、麻袋等二十二种，全部是手工业品。农民如果没有这些手工制造的农具，就根本无法进行生产。该村除了苏则庆农业生产合作社有一架打谷机（是闽侯专署奖给的，现在已损坏不能用）外，全部农具中再没有一件是机器工业品了。据该村农民董宝俤、陈传旺、苏奕妹等谈：常用的农具如锄、镰刀、草耙、堘刀、竹?等，每年至少有三分之一需要修补；解放以来，每年每户农民平均至少要用一百斤谷子修补农具，这种修补也是靠手工业。另一方面，由于农民翻身不久，在生产和生活上目前还存在若干困难，要想添置水车、风车、犁、耙等大农具，一时还不容易，因而解放近四年来，该村风车仍然是解放前的二十六部，水车也只增加了一部手车，只有锄、草耙、镰刀等常用农具，增加了约百分之十。这就说明：手工业农具将随着农业生产的进一步发展，不仅有很重要的位置，而且还有一定的发展余地。
    除了农具以外，溪下村农民的生产工具和生活用具，绝大部分也都是手工业品。这大约可分为五类。第一类是铁制品，有斧、柴刀、菜刀、锅、锯、钳、剪刀等约十五种；第二类是木制品，有桌、凳、床、桶、橱、箱、谷?（仓）等约十八种；第三类是竹制品，有梯、席、筷、蒸笼、篮、鱼捞、谷囤等约十二种，第四类是陶、瓷器具，有碗、碟、杯、匙、坛、钵、缸等约十二种；第五类是其他不属于上述四类的日用器具，有锡茶壶、铜烟筒、伞、梳等约十种。只有个别户购买了热水瓶、钢笔、电筒等工业品。这些情况说明，实用的手工业品，在目前农村中同样不可缺少，而这些东西，又不是一个短时期内就可由大工业品所代替的。
    在目前农村中，农民和手工业者是紧密结合在一起的，农业生产和手工业生产也是不可分割的。溪下村有二十六个农民兼做手工业，给家庭生活帮助很大。贫农苏明朗兼做木匠，每年要在村中或外村做木工约两百天，工资收入达一千多斤米，超过农业收入的二分之一。该村农民也常请外村的铁匠、篾匠（竹工）修补农具和家具。今年春天，光明乡就有两个篾匠到该村做了七、八十天工。这种就地生产的情况充分反映了小农经济的特点。
    溪下村农民的消费用品，主要的也是手工业品。目前，该村农民购用的布匹、食盐、食油、火油、毛巾等物，手工业品约占一半，工业品约占三成，其他（主要是食盐和火油）约占二成。由于解放后农业生产的不断提高，农民生活水平也不断提高，许多农民开始选购龙头布等细布做衣裳，还有个别农民购买了毛线、机制毛巾等工业品。这种消费性手工业品的市场有逐渐缩小的趋向。这一方面当然是说明了我国工业的逐渐发达，但另一方面也反映了本省手工业生产中存在的一个严重问题：质量不好和成本过高。如溪下村有些农民反映：龙头细布和土布价格差得不多，如果不是土布（指那些质量好的）比较耐穿，大家就都要穿细布了。这是需要重视的一个问题。另外还有一个情况，就是随着人民觉悟和文化水平的提高，农村中迷信浪费已大大减少。因此，据估计，溪下村迷信品的消费量比解放前约减少了百分之九十，而且目前还在继续减少。这就说明迷信品手工业者只有转业，才有发展前途。
