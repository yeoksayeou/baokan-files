Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th. Advance personnel from the five Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) teams dispatched to our side's specific ports have safely arrived by August 17th.

These five NNSC advance teams departed Kaesong at 13:00 on August 12th. The three teams going to Sinuiju, Manpo, and Sinanju all arrived on the 13th. The team going to Hungnam arrived on the 15th, and the team going to Chongjin arrived on the 17th.

The Supreme Headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers have established Liaison Officer Offices in the rear at these five specific ports. The offices are headed by a colonel-level officer each appointed by the KPA and CPV Commanders. Their task is to ensure the effective implementation of the clauses in the Armistice Agreement concerning the cessation of the introduction of reinforcing military forces from outside Korea. The offices will liaise with the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission teams stationed at the five rear ports to supervise the work and will be responsible for ensuring the safety of the NNSC personnel and resolving the daily life and supply issues of each team.

The full deployment of the work of the NNSC teams is only possible after all the follow-up personnel of the teams have arrived. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission initially decided that all personnel of each team would depart on the 12th. However, due to the U.S. side's claim of "inadequate preparation" at the ROK ports, only a portion of the advance personnel were dispatched on the 12th. But the U.S. side again stated on the 14th that "preparation was inadequate," and the departure date for the follow-up personnel of each team was postponed from the 15th to the 20th, causing undue delays in the deployment of each team's work.

### 中立国视察小组先遣人员抵我方特定口岸

    中立国视察小组先遣人员抵我方特定口岸
    【新华社开城十八日电】派赴我方特定口岸的五个中立国视察小组先遣人员，已在八月十七日前先后安全到达。
    这五个中立国视察小组先遣人员，是在八月十二日下午一时由开城出发的。到新义州、满浦和新安州的三个小组先遣人员，都在十三日到达。到兴南的小组先遣人员在十五日到达，到清津的小组先遣人员在十七日到达。
    朝鲜人民军最高司令部和中国人民志愿军司令部在这五个特定口岸设立了驻后方口岸联络官办事处，办事处由朝中司令官各派一名校级军官主持，其任务是为保证停战协定中有关停止自朝鲜境外进入增援的军事力量的条款能切实执行。办事处与驻在五后方口岸监督上述工作进行的中立国视察小组联系，并将负责保障中立国视察小组人员的安全及解决各小组日常生活事务及供应问题。
    各中立国视察小组工作的全面展开，须在小组的后续人员全部到达后才有可能。中立国监察委员会最初决定各小组的全体人员都在十二日出发，由于美方提出南朝鲜各口岸“准备不及”，因此在十二日仅派出一部分先遣人员。但美方在十四日再次表示“准备不及”，各小组后续人员的出发日期又由十五日推迟到二十日，使各小组工作的展开受到不应有的拖延。
