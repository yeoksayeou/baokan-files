Experiences in Promoting Planned Management in Design Work

Engineering Design Can Implement Planned Management

Any work, no matter how complex its external and internal connections, or how many links it has, can be planned and carried out according to the plan. This is to reduce the blindness and uneven development of the work. Design work has its inherent laws, and we can also follow its laws to carry out planned work.

In the past, we also had plans for design progress, but they only simply stipulated the design items and completion dates. This kind of plan was neither thorough nor executed in a spontaneous and passive state for a long time, so the work was often unevenly busy and idle, and the cooperation was not good, so the plan often could not be completed. A construction design drawing for an improved factory workshop for tool carts was modified seven times in principle, delaying the time by six months. Some factory buildings' process, power, lighting, and civil construction drawings have been designed and sent to the factory for half a year, but the water supply and drainage systems have not yet been designed. One factory's internal transportation equipment was delayed for a year before it was designed. Some design drawings were not sent to the factory in complete sets according to the engineering project, but first the civil construction, then the ventilation system, and then the water system, etc., so that the factory construction could not be carried out simultaneously, resulting in serious rework or shutdown.

Although the chaos and irresponsibility in design work were so serious, many ideological obstacles were still encountered when promoting planned management. Some designers, after exposing the above situation, still believed that: "The production department can make plans because the operation of machine tools is 'rigid' and relatively 'simple,' while design is a complex and comprehensive science, which relies on too much external data and cannot be planned." Some people even think that: "Design is an art, which needs to be repeatedly studied and refined, the longer the design time, the more exquisite the artwork, and the design time cannot be made into work quotas." In short, these comrades only emphasized the difficult side and did not realize that strengthening planned management and organizing rhythmic design work is an important key to following the laws of design work to control the design process.

We have recently vigorously promoted planned management in the design department, and gradually changed the chaotic situation in the past. We focused on promoting the four measures of "formulating specific operation plans," "designing according to instruction charts," "concluding contact contracts," and focusing on piloting the "personal responsibility system." In a very short period of time, the design efficiency has been significantly improved. Engineering projects that took six and a half months to design in the past can now be completed in only four months or three months. The ventilation design group and the mechanical design group completed one-third of the workload of the entire year of 1952 in one and a half months. The situation of tight and loose design work has been reduced, the mutual connection has been strengthened, the sense of responsibility of the designers has been improved, and the rework and modification in the design has also been reduced. The view that design work could not be planned in the past has also been changed. Generally, the plans can achieve an accuracy of more than 70%, some groups have reached 90%, and individual comrades have even reached 100% accuracy. In order to accurately or overfulfill the tasks according to their own plans and instruction charts, some comrades have created many advanced experiences. One draftsman used to make eleven parts drawings a day. Later, he adopted the method of making a series of similar parts drawings on a large drawing board at the same time, and the efficiency increased to 250%, and he could make 28 drawings a day. One group, with only 20 designers, completed 38 designs in two months, and produced 1,200 drawings.

Formulate Correct and Specific Operation Plans

Formulating correct and specific operation plans is the first step in the management of design work. It determines the scope of the entire design task and the balance of various professional designs, determines whether the potential strength can be fully utilized, and whether the design quality and design content can meet the production requirements. According to our experience, to formulate correct and specific operation plans, we must do the following things well:

(1) Determine the design items and conduct engineering queuing. First of all, the planning department and the chief designer should jointly formulate the design object projects one by one according to the planned task book. For example, for the overall design of a factory, it is necessary to determine the composition of the factory, then determine the professional design content of each component, and then arrange the design sequence according to the mutual relationship between general designs. When queuing the projects, we followed the following principles: (1) The order of the design items must be determined according to the needs of the country. The key projects of the country must be arranged for design within an appropriate period. (2) Arrange the plan according to the needs of production, especially for reconstruction and expansion projects, the projects urgently needed for production should be arranged in front. (3) Arrange the design according to the completeness of the existing data. Projects with relatively complete original data that can be designed can be placed at the front of the plan. (4) Consider the size of the design and construction volume of the project. For projects with complex internal design and complicated installation engineering, they should be placed in front, otherwise, these projects that take a long time to design and construct will not be able to complete the task on time. (5) Consider the construction area and the preparation of construction forces. For example, some areas have a late construction season and a short construction season. The projects in these places should be placed in front. The projects in areas with long construction seasons should be moved back slightly. (6) Under normal design conditions, for the overall design of a new factory, the production preparation workshops (such as tool workshops) and the main workshops with complex installation engineering should be carried out in the early stage. (7) The problem of design force balance should be considered. When the design force is not large enough, do not adopt the practice of spreading out design projects in an all-round way to disperse the forces, but consider the balance of the forces of various professional groups, and try to organize staggered and progressive rhythmic arrangement of design methods. In addition, while arranging operation plan projects, it is necessary to arrange plan projects for collecting original design data, and organize forces or sign contracts with production units to ensure that design data is obtained in a timely manner.

(2) Explore the design work quota and arrange the completion date of the design. Before there is a work quota, we first find experienced designers to draft the design procedures, and preliminarily study the work quota based on experience. These quotas are of course not accurate enough, but they can be used as a basis for preliminary arrangements to complete the planned date. Later, the original record system was established in the design process, and the design quota was gradually explored, and the design organization, design methods, steps, and reasons affecting the design progress were found from the comparison of various designs. The designers also found their own shortcomings in the work process from the exploration of the quota and improved the efficiency.

(3) Carry out mass formulation of operation plans so that the plans become conscious action indicators of the masses. This is the key to ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the task. For example, the person in charge of the ventilation design group and the planning unit subjectively estimated that it would take three months to complete the task. After mass discussion, they put forward many specific methods for rationally organizing the force, and it could be completed in one month. For example, some of our comrades used to reserve some "insurance periods" when making plans. For example, one draftsman clearly could complete the work in five days, but he made it eight days, which disrupted the balance of the entire professional design plan. In the process of mobilizing the masses to make plans, he realized the important significance of planned management, not only canceled the "insurance period," but also completed the drawing task ahead of schedule.

In the process of implementing the plan, the progress of the plan should also be checked in a timely manner. Due to lack of experience and inability to correctly grasp the laws of design, we often have situations such as inadequate planning, improper scheduling, and failure to provide technical conditions correctly and in a timely manner. Therefore, it is very necessary to make corresponding revisions to the plan in the implementation process.

Organize Rhythmic Design Work According to Instruction Charts

Organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts is also an equally applicable scientific planned management method for design institutions. After we implemented rhythmic design work according to instruction charts, the designers have confidence in completing the tasks, and the entire planned management unit can fully grasp the actual design progress, discover weak links in time, study countermeasures, and overcome the situation of idling and stagnation in the design.

The following aspects should be paid attention to when designing according to instruction charts: First of all, a detailed and correct operation plan is the basis of the instruction charts. The operation plan is formulated in accordance with the needs and possible conditions, and the instruction charts can be realized. Secondly, the formulation of instruction charts must be based on reasonable procedures that conform to the laws of design work. If the operation plan does not consider the balance of various professional designs, the instruction charts will also lose their effectiveness. Thirdly, in order to make the instruction charts truly play the role of instructing the design work, we must mobilize the masses to use their brains. Charts are relatively easy to formulate, and using instruction lines to represent the design progress is only the beginning of the planning work. The real planning work is after the formulation of the instruction charts, all forces must be organized to study methods to ensure the completion of the plan. When we first promoted the instruction charts, some comrades did not realize this, and in the end some instruction charts became formal and became charts that did not play an instruction role.

We use three types of instruction charts: First, the instruction charts of the entire office. It mainly shows the relationship between various professional designs of each project, so as to grasp the design progress of each project in the entire office and the balance between the designs. Second, the instruction chart of the professional group, with the project and the person in charge of the design as the unit, focuses on showing the daily progress of each project and the relationship between the designs. This chart is convenient for the group to grasp the progress and find weak links to adjust the design force. Third, the personal operation instruction chart, which lists in detail each step of the design procedure and lists the planned time. This is a timetable for instructing the designer to carry out the work. It can show the design progress, what problems may be encountered in the design, what preparations need to be made in each design stage, and the connection time between this work and the other work. The form of the chart does not necessarily require uniformity, because the relationship between various professional designs in the overall design is different. The process design has the most complex relationship with various aspects, while the equipment design has little contact with other aspects. Therefore, the form of the instruction chart does not need to be forced to be uniform, only simplicity, clarity, science and rationality are required.

Contact Contracts between Various Designs

Because the overall design is a comprehensive design with complex relationships, whether each link is closely integrated will determine the design quality and the design process. For example, the location of the trench designed for ventilation and heating affects the civil construction design, and the building materials, wall thickness, cold protection layer thickness, window form and area of the civil construction design are the prerequisites for heating design. Each professional design requires other professional groups to provide technical conditions within a certain period of time. At the same time, it is necessary to provide other professional groups with technical conditions within a certain period of time. Therefore, the overall design must be carried out in parallel and staggered by various designs. It cannot be a single assembly line operation. If these complex connections between designs are not clarified, and the work of organizing the exchange of technical conditions is not done in a timely manner, it is easy to cause rework and modification, contradictions between designs, and unbalanced situations such as work stoppages and waiting for materials.

The so-called contact contract is to formulate a plan for the exchange of technical designs between professional designers according to the procedure of this design before the design begins. This plan includes the items required for technical conditions, which group should provide them and when to provide them. After discussion and confirmation, each professional designer signs and executes the contract. This kind of contact contract is usually roughly drawn up before starting a design, and then discussed in detail and formally signed between the completion of the process design. After we implemented the contact contract, it was approved by every designer, who felt that the connection between designs in the past was too poor, resulting in serious passivity in their work. At present, we have adopted the method of contact contract for every more complex design we start.

Due to the widespread signing of contact contracts, the progress of all design projects has been shortened compared to the past, generally shortening by a quarter of the time. The sense of responsibility of the designers has also been generally improved. They are willing to work hard to provide other professional groups with technical conditions on time, fully and actively according to the contract. After the design connection is strengthened, the contradictory situations between various professional designs have also been basically eliminated, and the viewpoint of taking care of all aspects in the design has been universally and deeply transformed into the design thinking of all personnel. At the same time, the collectivist thinking of the designers has also been deepened politically.

The process of implementing contact contracts is the process of exploring design laws. Leading cadres of design institutions, planning departments and all designers must deeply study and master the laws of contact between designs.

Finally, in the process of executing the contract, it is necessary to strengthen the inspection and supervision of the implementation, which is an important key to ensuring the implementation of the contract.

Implement the Personal Responsibility System

The phenomenon of irresponsibility or irresponsibility in design is one of the important roots of poor design quality.

We have absorbed the past experience and focused on piloting the responsibility system. According to the initial experience, we believe that the following responsibility systems should be implemented.

(1) General Responsibility System: A factory's overall design should be the responsibility of the chief designer. Under the leadership of the director and the chief engineer, the chief designer participates in the site selection of the factory, determines the composition of the factory, and jointly formulates design projects with the planning department, and assigns specific tasks to each professional design group. The technical connection problems between various professional designs must be discussed and determined with the chief designer. The chief designer is responsible for providing each professional design group with original data. The acquisition of these data should be contracted by the chief designer in conjunction with the data management department and the entrusted design unit, or organize forces to conduct investigations. The chief designer is responsible for answering all questions raised by the designed factory, but the specific solution to certain technical problems can be handed over to a designated person in each professional design group to be responsible for answering. All technical documents and drawings issued to the factory and externally must be signed and approved by the chief designer in charge of the factory. In addition, the chief designer also needs to study the opinions of production and construction and the inventions and creations of relevant enterprises, and urge the designers to adopt advanced quotas and technical experience to improve the design quality.

The establishment of the general responsibility system makes the chief designer the hub for mastering the overall design. At present, we lack experienced cadres, but we should adopt the method of cultivating them in work, and should not fail to establish a chief designer because of this, causing chaos in the overall design.

(2) Professional Design Responsibility System: After the chief designer determines the design project and prepares to start the design, each professional design needs a special person in charge. And each project, such as a workshop, is the overall responsibility of the process designer for the project. In addition to ensuring that the designed drawings have technical possibilities and economic rationality, the persons in charge of each professional design must also be responsible for grasping the close connection between the designs of each profession, and ensuring that technical conditions are provided to other professional design groups accurately and in a timely manner. For comprehensive factory buildings often used in industry (such as workshops that include mechanical processing, electroplating, and heat treatment at the same time), there also needs to be an overall design person in charge of the factory building. This can be the responsibility of the process designer of the main workshop in the factory building. He should comprehensively consider the division and coordination of the workshops in the factory building, as well as various major technical principles. The technical conditions of the workshop design should be integrated into technical conditions with the factory building as a unit. The professional design responsibility system is one of the important conditions for specifically ensuring good design quality.

(3) Work Procedure Responsibility System: Each procedure of the design requires clear responsibility. Engineers (or the main person in charge of the professional design) and designers need to clarify their respective responsibilities. The engineer (or the main person in charge of the professional design) is mainly responsible for deciding and reviewing the principal issues in the design. The designer guarantees the correct decision of all calculations and specific technical issues in the design, and should make detailed proofreading of the details of the drawings. Drawing, tracing, and reviewing designers also need to determine their respective responsibilities. After we implemented the work procedure responsibility system, the most prominent effect was that the number of detail errors in the design drawings was greatly reduced, which avoided tedious repeated modifications, saved design time, and improved the quality of the drawings.

(4) Audit Responsibility System: In order to ensure the correctness of the design drawings, a strict audit responsibility system is required. In addition to conducting the audit of the professional design itself, cross-audit is also required. A design must be audited and approved by the person in charge of other related designs. After the overall design is completed, if it is a more complex comprehensive factory building, a collective audit should also be organized. Before the audit, make full preparations, and prepare audit outlines for various professional designs, and conduct a detailed audit accordingly, mainly to ensure the correct and reasonable cooperation of various professional designs.

    在设计工作中推行计划管理的体会
    第二机械工业部第四局设计室技术员  立之
    工程设计是可以推行计划管理的
    任何一项工作，无论其外部联系与内部联系如何复杂，环节如何多，都能够制订计划并按计划进行工作。这样做是为了减少工作的盲目性和发展的不平衡性。设计工作存在着内在规律，同样可以遵循其规律进行有计划的工作。
    过去我们在设计进度上，也曾有过计划，但那只是简单地规定一下设计项目及完成日期而已。这种计划既不周密，而在执行中又长期处在自流的、被动的状态，因此工作中经常是忙闲不匀，配合不好，也就经常不能完成计划。有一个改进厂房工具车间的施工设计图，前后作了七次原则性的修改，拖延时间六个月。有些厂房的工艺、动力、照明、土建等各种图纸均已设计好，发给工厂已半年，但上下水道竟还没有设计。有一个厂房内运输设备竟拖了一年才设计好。有些设计图纸不是按工程项目成套发给工厂，而是先发了土木建筑，又发通风系统，再发水道系统等，使厂内施工不能同时进行，以致造成严重返工或停工情况。
    虽然设计工作中的忙乱和无人负责状况如此严重，但在推行计划管理时仍然遇到很多思想障碍。有些设计人员在揭露了上述情况后，仍认为：“生产部门能订计划，因为机床操作是‘死板’的，比较‘简单’，而设计是一门复杂综合的科学，它依据外界资料太多，无法制订计划。”还有一部分人员甚至认为：“设计是一种艺术，需要三番五次地反复磋研，设计的时间愈久，艺术品就愈精美，设计时间是不能做出工时定额的。”总之，这些同志只强调了困难的一面而没有认识到加强计划管理，组织有节奏的设计工作，乃是遵循设计工作规律以驾驭设计进程的重要关键之一。
    我们最近在设计部门大力推行了计划管理，逐渐地改变了过去混乱的情况。我们着重推行了“订立具体的作业计划”、“按指示图表进行设计”、“订立联系合同”及重点试行“专人负责制”四项措施。在很短的时间内，显著地提高了设计效率，过去六个半月设计完的工程项目，只需要四个月或者三个月就可以完成，通风设计组及机械设计组都在一个半月内完成了相当一九五二年全年工作量三分之一的任务。设计工作时紧时松的情况减少了，相互间的联系加强了，设计人员的责任心提高了，设计中的返工修改情况也减少了。过去认为设计工作无法制订计划的看法，也改变过来了。一般所订计划都能达到百分之七十以上的准确度，有些小组达到了百分之九十，个别的同志甚至达到百分之一百的准确度。有些同志为了能准确地或超额地按自己制订的计划和指示图表完成任务，创造了很多的先进经验。有一个制图员以前每天制十一张零件图，后来他采用了在大图板上同时制一系列形状类似的零件图的方法，效率提高到百分之二百五十，一天可制二十八张图。有一个组，仅二十个设计人员，两个月内完成了三十八项设计，出图纸一千二百张。
    制订正确而具体的作业计划
    制订正确而具体的作业计划，是设计工作管理的首要步骤，它决定整个设计任务的范围及各专业设计的平衡，决定潜在力量能否充分发挥，设计质量、设计内容能否适合生产要求等重大问题。根据我们的经验要制订正确而具体的作业计划，必须做好下面几件工作：
    （一）确定设计项目，进行工程排队。首先应该由计划部门与总设计师共同根据计划任务书一项不漏地制订设计对象项目。譬如说一个工厂的总体设计，需要确定工厂的组成，然后确定各个组成部分的专业设计内容，再根据一般设计之间的相互关系来排定设计顺序。在工程排队的时候，我们是根据以下几个原则进行的：（1）设计项目先后顺序的编制必须根据国家的需要情况来决定。国家的重点工程必须排在合适的时期内进行设计。（2）根据生产的需要来排定计划，尤其是改建和扩建工程，应该将生产上急需的工程安排在前面。（3）根据现有资料齐备的程度来安排设计的前后。原始资料较完备可能动手设计的项目，可放在计划的前面。（4）应该考虑工程的设计量及施工量的大小。对于设计内部复杂，安装工程繁琐的项目，应放在前面，否则便会影响这些设计与施工费时较多的工程无法按时完成任务。（5）应考虑到工程建筑的区域及施工力量的准备情况。譬如说，有些地区的开工季节迟，施工季节短，这些地方的工程就应放在前面。而施工季节长的地区的工程就应稍向后移。（6）在正常设计的情况下，对于一个新建工厂的总体设计，应将生产准备诸车间（如工具车间）及安装工程复杂的诸主要车间先期进行。（7）应研究设计力量平衡问题。在设计力量不够大的时候，不要采用设计项目全面铺开分散力量的做法，而须考虑各个专业组力量平衡，设法组织交错递进有节奏地安排设计的办法。此外，在编排作业计划项目的同时，要编排收集设计原始资料的计划项目，并组织力量或与生产单位订立合同，以保证及时得到设计资料。
    （二）摸索设计工时定额，安排完成设计日期。在还没有工时定额的时候，我们先找有经验的设计人员草拟设计程序，并根据经验初步研究出工时定额来。这些定额当然是不够正确的，但可作为初步安排完成计划日期的依据。以后在设计过程中建立了原始记录制度，逐步摸索到了设计的定额，并且能从各种设计的比较中发现设计组织，设计方法、步骤、影响设计进度的原因等各方面的问题，设计人员也从摸索定额过程中发现了自己工作中的缺点，提高了效率。
    （三）开展群众性的制订作业计划工作，使计划成为群众自觉的行动指标，这是保证完成和超额完成任务的关键。例如通风设计组负责人及计划单位主观估计需要三个月才能完成的任务，经过群众讨论，提出很多合理组织力量的具体办法，在一个月内就能完成。又如我们有些同志过去订计划时，总是留些“保险期”，如有一个绘图员，明明五天可完成的工作，竟订成八天，这就打乱了整个专业设计计划的平衡。在发动群众订计划过程中，他认识了计划管理的重要意义，不但取消了“保险期”，而且提前完成了绘图任务。
    在执行计划的过程中还应适时地检查计划进度情况。由于经验不足，不能正确地掌握设计规律，我们常常发生计划不周、调度不当、技术条件不能正确及时供给等情况。因此，在执行过程中，对计划做相应的修改是很必要的。
    按指示图表组织有节奏的设计工作
    按指示图表进行有节奏生产对于设计机构也是同样适用的科学的计划管理方法。我们推行了按指示图表进行有节奏的设计工作之后，设计人员对自己完成任务有了信心，而且使整个计划管理单位能充分掌握设计实际进度，及时发现薄弱环节，研究对策，克服设计中窝工和阻滞的情况。
    按指示图表进行设计须注意以下几方面：首先，详尽正确的作业计划是指示图表的基础，作业计划是切实按照需要与可能的条件制订的，指示图表也才能有实现的可能。其次，指示图表的制订必需依据合乎设计工作规律的合理工序，如作业计划没有考虑各种专业设计的平衡，指示图表亦将失去效用。第三要使指示图表真正能发挥指示设计工作的作用，必须发动众群开动脑筋。图表是比较容易制订的，用指示线来表示设计进度还只是计划工作的开端，真正的计划工作是在指示图表制订之后，必须组织一切力量研究办法来保证完成计划。我们开始推行指示图表时，有些同志没有认识这一点，最后有部分指示图表流于形式，变成了不起指示作用的图表。
    我们采用的指示图表有三种：一、全处的指示图表。主要是表现每项工程的各种专业设计之间的关系，以便掌握全处各项工程设计进度及诸设计之间的平衡。二、专业组的指示图表，以工程项目及设计负责人为单位，着重表现每项工程的逐日进度及设计之间的关系，这个图表便于组内掌握进度并发现薄弱环节调整设计力量。三、个人作业指示图表，表里详细地列出每一步设计程序，列出计划时间，这是一张指示设计者进行工作时间表，能表明设计进度，设计中可能遇到什么问题，每一设计阶段需做些什么准备工作，及此工作与彼一工作的衔接时间。图表的形式并不一定要求统一，因为总体设计中各种专业设计的关系不同。工艺设计与各方面的关系最复杂，而设备设计几乎与别的方面很少联系，因之，指示图表的形式也就不必强求统一，只求其简单明了和科学合理就可以。
    各项设计之间的联系合同
    由于总体设计是一个综合的关系复杂的设计，每
    一个环节是否紧密结合，都将决定设计质量及设计的进程。譬如说：通风暖气设计的地沟位置影响土建设计，而土建设计的房屋建筑材料及墙厚、防寒层厚、窗的形式及面积等，又是进行暖气设计的先决技术条件。每一种专业设计都要求其他专业组在
    一定时间内供给技术条件，同时，自己又要在一定时间内供给其他专业组技术条件。因之，总体设计必须是各种设计平行流水交错进行的，不可能是单
    一的流水作业。这些设计之间的复杂联系不搞清楚，组织交换技术条件的工作做得不及时，就容易发生返工修改，设计之间相互矛盾以及停工待料等不平衡情况。
    所谓联系合同，就是在设计开始之前，根据这个设计的程序，订出各专业设计者相互间交换技术设计的计划。这个计划包括技术条件要求的项目，应由何组供给及何时供给等问题。经过讨论确定以后，各专业设计者签字，并按合同执行。这种联系合同通常是在开始一个设计之前粗略订出，而在工艺设计完毕之间，再详细讨论，正式签定。在我们推行联系合同之后，受到每个设计人员的赞同，他们深感过去设计之间联系太差，以致造成自己工作中的严重被动。目前，我们每开始一个较复杂的设计，都采用了联系合同的办法。
    由于普遍订立联系合同，使所有设计项目的进程都比以前缩短，一般的均较以往缩短四分之一的时间。设计人员的责任心也普遍提高了，都愿努力按合同准时地、充分地、主动地供给其他专业组以技术条件。设计的联系加强后，各种专业设计相互矛盾的情况也基本上根绝，在设计中照顾全面的观点，普遍深入地变成了全体人员的设计思想。同时，在政治上也加深了设计人员的集体主义思想。
    推行联系合同的过程，是摸索设计规律的过程。设计机构的领导干部，计划部门及全体设计人员都必须深入研究、掌握设计之间的联系规律。
    最后，在执行合同的过程中，必须加强对执行情况的检查与督促，这是保证合同贯彻的重要关键。
    实行专人负责制
    设计中的无人负责或者不负责任现象，乃是设计质量低劣的重要根源之一。
    我们吸收了过去的经验，重点试行了责任制，根据初步的体会，认为应该推行以下几种负责制。
    （一）总负责制：一个工厂总体设计应有总设计师负责。总设计师在处长及总工程师领导下参加该工厂的厂址选择，确定工厂组成，并与计划部门共同制订设计项目，给各专业设计组分配具体任务。各专业设计之间的技术联系问题，必须与总设计师讨论确定。总设计师有责任供给各专业设计组以原始资料，这些资料的获得应由总设计师会同资料管理部门与委托设计单位订立合同，或者组织力量进行调查。总设计师有责任解答所设计工厂提出的一切问题，但具体解决某些技术问题时，可以交给各专业设计组指定专人负责答复。各种发给工厂及对外之技术文件与图纸，必须经过负责该厂的总设计师签字同意。此外，总设计师尚需研究生产及施工方面的意见及有关企业的发明创造，促使设计人员采用先进的定额与技术经验，以改进设计质量。
    总负责制的确立，使总设计师成为掌握全面设计的枢纽。目前我们缺乏有经验的干部，但应采取在工作中培养的办法，不能因之而不设立总设计师，造成总体设计中的混乱情况。
    （二）专业设计负责制：在总设计师确定设计项目并准备开始设计之后，各项专业设计均需有专门负责人。而每项工程，如一个车间，又以工艺设计者为该项工程总体负责人。各专业设计负责人除保证所设计图纸具有技术的可能性及经济的合理性外，还需切实负责掌握各专业设计之间的密切联系，保证准确而及时地供给其他专业设计组以技术条件。对于工业上常采用的综合性厂房，（如大厂房内同时包括机械加工，电镀、热处理等车间）还需要有以厂房为单位的总体设计负责人。这可以由该厂房内主要车间的工艺设计者负责，他应全面地考虑厂房内车间之划分与配合，以及各种重大的技术上的原则问题；应综合车间设计技术条件，成为以厂房为单位的技术条件。各专业设计负责制是具体保证设计质量良好的重要条件之一。
    （三）工序责任制：设计的每一个程序，需要责任分明，工程师（或该专业设计主要负责人），设计员，需要明确各自的责任。工程师（或该专业设计主要负责人）主要负责决定与审核设计中原则问题，设计者保证正确的决定一切计算及设计中具体的技术问题，并应作所绘图纸的细节校对。绘图、描图、及审核设计人员亦需确定各自专责。我们推行了工序责任制之后，最突出的效果是设计图纸细节错误大量减少，这样就避免了繁冗的反复修改，节省了设计时间，提高了图纸质量。
    （四）审核责任制：为保证设计图纸的正确，需要进行严格的审核责任制。除开进行各专业设计本身的审核外，还需进行交错审核，一种设计必须得到有关的其他各种设计负责人的审核和同意。总体设计结束后，如果是较复杂的综合性厂房，还需组织集体审核。审核之前，做充分的准备工作，拟出各专业设计的审核提纲，据此进行详细审核，主要保证各种专业设计正确合理地配合。
