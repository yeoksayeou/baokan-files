People in various parts of Democratic Germany hold rallies to welcome the Soviet government's assistance to the German people

    The people of the German Democratic Republic welcome with deep appreciation the Soviet government's note of August 15 to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the German question.

    On August 17, many industries and enterprises in the democratic sector of Berlin held rallies to discuss the Soviet note. Speakers at these rallies included government officials, leaders of democratic parties, and mass organizations. These rallies later became demonstrations by the German people expressing gratitude for the assistance given by the Soviet government in their national struggle to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

    At a rally of workers at the Berlin Radio Equipment Factory in the Köpenick district, Deputy Prime Minister Walter Ulbricht and Hans Loch of the German Democratic Republic delivered speeches to the workers. Ulbricht said that everyone in East and West Germany wholeheartedly welcomed the Soviet government's note, because it pointed out the path to lasting peace in Europe. After Ulbricht's speech, a representative of the factory workers spoke, welcoming the new Soviet note and emphasizing that the note was of great significance to the early peaceful resolution of the German question.

    At a rally of the state-owned Schelling enterprises in Adlershof, Deputy Prime Ministers Heinrich Rau and Otto Nuschke of the German Democratic Republic delivered speeches to the workers. Heinrich Rau said: This note encourages all patriotic people in Germany.

    Democratic newspapers in Berlin prominently published numerous commentaries from the people of the German Democratic Republic on the Soviet government's note. Newspapers that did not publish on Mondays carried the full text of the note on August 18. The newspapers also carried materials related to the Soviet note.

    "Neues Deutschland" wrote that the Soviet government's proposals had made a very deep impression everywhere. The patriotic forces of the German people believe that this new note and the proposals it contains are a great help to their struggle to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. The entire German people particularly welcome the proposals to exempt Germany from reparations and postwar national debt obligations from January 1, 1954, and to limit the huge expenses of the occupying forces stationed in Germany. "Neues Deutschland" concluded that the people generally believe that the recent Soviet note is a clear and genuine step towards eliminating international tension and consolidating peace and security. The "National-Zeitung," the organ of the German National Democratic Party, wrote in an editorial: Every German will welcome these proposals with deep gratitude. The newspaper quoted the Soviet note as saying that no one can deny that only through the peaceful and democratic development of Germany, and only through cooperation with other countries striving to strengthen peace and international security, is it possible to rebuild Germany into a great power that can achieve an appropriate international position. The newspaper also emphasized that this proposal represents the interests of all peace-loving people, including the German people.

West German newspapers prominently publish the new Soviet note

    On August 17, West Berlin evening newspapers all carried the news of the Soviet government's recent note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States on the German question with banner headlines on the front page.

    The newspaper "Express," licensed for publication by the French occupation authorities, published a message with the headline "Moscow Makes Practical Proposals," saying: It is impractical to "express doubts" about the "impact" the Soviet note will have on the mood of the German people. The newspaper said: People cannot answer this proposal with a simple "no" or evasive tactics... This practical proposal should be considered.

    The Berlin "Evening Telegraph" said: It is necessary to agree to the Soviet note, hold negotiations, and stop using all "trickery."

    The West Berlin Social Democratic newspaper "Monday Morning News" published an abstract of the Soviet note. The newspaper said that the note was "unexpected" and pointed out that the "tone was very mild." The newspaper believes:

    "Yesterday's Soviet note must be thoroughly studied," and at the same time suggests that Western countries "should also be willing to make concessions."

    The newspaper "Hamburger Echo," which is close to the German Social Democratic Party, said in an editorial on August 17: If West Germany joins the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, it will make it impossible for East and West Germany to unite. The newspaper said that the German people, whether they live in West Germany or the German Democratic Republic, are already tired of and have a headache from exchanging notes. The newspaper believes that "the Soviet note includes some statements worthy of discussion. For example—the Soviet Union believes that it is inappropriate to ignore the important changes that have taken place in the eight years since the Potsdam Conference and that these changes should be taken into account... If the Western countries and the Federal Government really hope to unify Germany, it is unforgivable to give the Soviet Union the initiative on the decisive issue of easing international tensions."

    All West Berlin afternoon newspapers published abstracts of the Soviet note on August 18.

    The "Spandauer Volksblatt" published a conversation between German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer and a reporter from the German News Agency in Stuttgart regarding the Soviet government's new note. Ollenhauer said: The prominent feature of the Soviet note is that it only talks about the German question. He believes that the Soviet Union now at least attaches great importance to stipulating the general principles for the unified German question. He finally stated that both parties should stop exchanging notes to no avail, and should finally meet at the conference table.

    The Berlin "Morgenpost" expressed concern about the possible impact of the Soviet government's note on West German voters.

People's Democratic countries in Eastern Europe publish commentaries believing that the Soviet note makes an important contribution to peace

    Newspapers in the People's Democratic countries of Eastern Europe published the Soviet note to the United States, Britain, and France on the German question on the 18th, and published commentaries.

    Major newspapers in Warsaw published the full text of the Soviet government's note. The newspapers widely commented on the Soviet note, believing it to be an important contribution to solving the German question and consolidating peace in Europe and the world. An editorial in "The People's Tribune" said: The Soviet government's new peace initiative represents the interests of the people of all countries struggling to safeguard peace in Europe, and first and foremost the interests of Germany's neighbors and the German people themselves. The newspaper, in pointing out the thorough democratic nature of the Soviet proposal, particularly emphasizes the concrete form and feasibility of the proposal.

    The Budapest "Free People's Daily" published the full text of the Soviet government's note and published an editorial saying: The United States stubbornly insists on its aggressive plans. Contrary to the plan to revive German aggression, the Soviet Union has put forward a concrete plan to establish a peaceful and democratic Germany. The Soviet note proposes a method for solving all problems related to Germany, which is not only appropriate but also completely feasible. The Soviet proposal once again embodies the principles of Soviet peaceful diplomacy: at present, there are no disputes or unresolved issues that cannot be resolved peacefully on the basis of mutual agreement among the countries concerned. This proposal fully meets the interests of the German people and the interests of peace in Europe.

    Newspapers in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania also published the Soviet government's note.

    The Albanian "People's Voice" and "Unity" published the full text of the Soviet note; Radio Tirana broadcast the full text of the Soviet note on the evening of the 18th.

British, French and other countries' newspapers widely value the Soviet note

    Bourgeois public opinion admits that it must be carefully considered

    The Soviet government's note of August 15 to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, suggesting that practical measures be taken immediately to resolve the German question, has received widespread attention in Western countries. Progressive newspapers pointed out that the Soviet note provided a practical solution to the German question, which is in the interests of the German people and European peace. Comments in bourgeois newspapers are extremely chaotic, but they also acknowledge that the Soviet government's note cannot be ignored and must be carefully considered.

    According to TASS: The British "Daily Worker" heartily welcomed the Soviet note. An editorial in the "Daily Worker" said: "This note is an extremely important step towards the peaceful settlement of the outstanding issues in today's world. Its proposals are far-reaching and practical."

    Many other British newspapers published abstracts of the note. Newspaper comments varied. The Berlin correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" wrote: "It is already generally recognized in the West that this note has made significant concessions, thus putting the West in an awkward position." An editorial in the "Daily Herald" said: "It is almost certain that the West will not be satisfied with the note." The newspaper suggested agreeing to Churchill's proposal to hold high-level talks with no predetermined agenda. "The Times" and other newspapers said that the Soviet Union put forward this note with the intention of undermining Adenauer's hopes of winning the upcoming election.

    The French "L'Humanité" published the full text of the Soviet note. In a commentary, "L'Humanité" pointed out that the Soviet note is in line with the legitimate aspirations of the German people, and also fully meets the interests of the French people and the need to maintain peace. "Liberation" believes that the main proposals put forward by the Soviet Union regarding a peace treaty with Germany are "very reasonable." "Liberation" emphasized that Washington's first reaction to the Soviet note was hostile. At the same time, he expressed dissatisfaction with Adenauer's hostile reaction to the Soviet note.

    Other French newspapers also published comments. "Le Figaro" called the Soviet note "unexpected." "Le Figaro" said that the Western countries would not agree with the Soviet note's proposal to establish a provisional government and neutralize Germany.

    The Hague "Telegraaf" in the Netherlands called the Soviet note the most powerful diplomatic offensive launched by the Atlantic front. The newspaper said: Now, it must be made clear: whether the West European organization is supported in Germany - for example, by a majority of voters.

    All Italian newspapers prominently published news about the Soviet note. "Unità" used the headline "The Soviet Union Advocates Immediately Forming a Unified German Government" and commented that the note's "intention is to pave the way for reaching an agreement to solve the German question." "Il Tempo" had the headline: "Moscow Proposes Unifying Germany to Western Countries." "Il Messaggero" had the headline, "The Soviet Union Asks to Hold a Peace Conference with Germany."

    All Belgian newspapers carried detailed summaries of the Soviet note with large headlines. A headline in "Le Drapeau Rouge" said: "The Soviet government's recent note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States provides an opportunity for an early solution to the German question."

    All Vienna evening newspapers on the 17th carried news about the Soviet government's note on the front page. The "Abendpost" detailed the Soviet note, especially pointing out the places in the note that talked about reducing Germany's financial and economic obligations due to the war.

    American newspapers also reported the Soviet government's note to the three governments on the German question as important news. The "New York Times" commented on the reaction caused by the Soviet note among Washington officials, saying: "Moscow's note surprised and confused diplomatic figures in Washington." The newspaper's Berlin correspondent wrote: "The general opinion is that the German people's desire to restore German unity is so strong that it is politically dangerous to directly reject the Soviet note."

The U.S. State Department evades expressing a positive opinion

    According to TASS, Washington, 19th: U.S. State Department spokesman Lipp made a statement to the press on the Soviet government's note on the German question. The State Department avoided stating its opinion on the main points of the Soviet note, and only said that the Soviet note seemed to postpone the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting proposed by the three countries until next year, although the Soviet note did not mention this.

    苏联对德问题照会获得普遍重视
    民主德国各地人民纷纷举行集会欢迎苏联政府对德国人民的援助
    德意志民主共和国人民都以深切感佩的心情，欢迎苏联政府八月十五日就德国问题致美、英、法三国政府的照会。
    八月十七日，柏林民主区许多产业与企业部门举行了集会讨论苏联的照会。在这些集会上演说的有政府人员、民主党派和群众组织领袖。这些集会后来都变成了德国人民对于苏联政府在他们争取建立一个统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国的全国性斗争中所给予的援助表示感激的示威。
    在哥本尼克区柏林无线电设备工厂的工人集会上，德意志民主共和国副总理瓦尔特·乌布利希和汉斯·洛赫向工人们发表了演说。乌布利希说：东西德的每一个人都衷心地欢迎苏联政府的照会，因为它指出了通向欧洲持久和平的道路。在乌布利希讲话之后，该厂工人代表发言表示欢迎苏联政府的新照会，并强调指出这个照会对于早日和平解决德国问题具有重大意义。
    在阿德勒绍夫的公营的谢林企业的集会上，德意志民主共和国副总理亨利希·劳和奥托·努舍克向工人们发表了演说。亨利希·劳说：这个照会鼓舞了所有德国的爱国人民。
    柏林民主报纸以显著地位刊载了德意志民主共和国人民对于苏联政府照会的许多评论。那些星期一没有出报的报纸在八月十八日刊载了照会的全文。各报并刊载了与苏联照会有关的材料。
    “新德意志报”写道，苏联政府的建议在各处都造成了极深刻的印象。德国人民的爱国力量认为，这个新照会及其中所包含的建议，对他们为建立一个统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国而进行的斗争是一个巨大的帮助。全体德国人民特别欢迎自一九五四年一月一日起免除德国偿付赔偿费和战后国债的义务，并限制各国驻德占领军的庞大费用的建议。“新德意志报”最后说，人民普遍认为，苏联最近的照会是走向消除国际紧张局势，巩固和平与安全的明确的、真正的步骤。德国国家民主党机关报“国民日报”在社论中写道：每一个德国人都将怀着深深的感激心情来欢迎这些建议。该报援引了苏联照会中的话说，没有一个人能够否认，只有通过德国的和平民主发展，只有通过与其它为加强和平与国际安全而奋斗的国家的合作，才有可能把德国重建成一个可以取得适当国际地位的大国。该报又强调说，这一建议代表着所有爱好和平人民，包括德国人民的利益。
    西德报纸显著刊载苏联新照会
    八月十七日，西柏林晚报都在第一版以通栏标题刊载苏联政府最近就德国问题致法国、英国和美国政府照会的消息。
    法国占领当局许可出版的报纸“快报”以“莫斯科提出实际建议”为题发表消息说：假使对于苏联照会将对德国人民的情绪产生的“影响表示怀疑”，那是不实际的。该报说：人们不能够以一个简单的“不”字或规避手法来答覆这个建议……这个实际建议应该予以考虑。
    柏林“每晚电讯报”说：必须同意苏联的照会，举行谈判，停止使用一切“权术”。
    西柏林社会民主党报纸“星期一晨报”发表了苏联照会的摘要。该报说，这个照会是“出人意外的”，并指出，照会的“语气很温和”。该报认为：
    “必须要对昨天苏联的照会进行彻底的研究”，同时建议西方国家“也同样愿意作让步”。
    接近德国社会民主党的报纸“汉堡回声报”八月十七日的社论说：如果西德加入侵略性的北大西洋公约，将使得东西德不可能统一。该报说，德国人民，不管他们是住在西德也好，住在德意志民主共和国也好，对于交换照会已经感到厌倦了，头痛了。该报认为，“苏联照会中包括了一些值得讨论的声明。举一个例来说——苏联认为忽视波茨坦会议以来八年中所发生的一些重要变化是不适当的，应该考虑到这些变化……假使西方国家和联邦政府当真希望统一德国的话，再把缓和国际紧张局势这样一个决定性意义的问题的主动权让给苏联就是不可原恕的了。”
    八月十八日所有西柏林的午报都刊载了苏联照会的摘要。
    “史盘刀人民报”刊载了德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔就苏联政府的新照会对德意志新闻社驻斯图加特记者所发表的谈话。奥伦豪尔说：苏联照会的显著的特点，是它只谈到德国问题。他认为苏联现在至少是很重视规定统一德国问题的一般原则。他最后表示，双方应该停止毫无结果地交换照会，并且最后应该在会议桌上会面。
    柏林“晨邮报”对于苏联政府照会可能给西德选民的影响表示不安。
    东欧人民民主国家报纸发表评论认为苏联照会对和平有重要贡献
    东欧各人民民主国家报纸十八日都刊载了苏联就德国问题致美、英、法三国的照会，并发表评论。
    华沙各大报纸登载了苏联政府照会的全文。各报广泛地评论了苏联的照会，认为它是对解决德国问题和巩固欧洲和全世界和平的一个重要的贡献。“人民论坛报”的社论说：苏联政府新的和平倡议，代表着为保障欧洲和平而斗争的各国人民的利益，首先是德国邻国和德国人民本身的利益。该报在指出苏联建议的彻底的民主性质时，特别着重指出这个建议的具体形式和可行性。
    布达佩斯“自由人民报”登载了苏联政府照会的全文，并发表社论说：美国顽固地坚持它的侵略计划。和复活德国的侵略的计划相反，苏联提出建立一个和平民主德国的具体方案。苏联照会提出了解决一切有关德国的问题的方法，这种方法不仅是适当的，而且是完全行得通的。苏联的建议再一次地体现了苏联和平外交政策的原则：目前，没有任何争端或未解决的问题不能在有关各国互相协议的基础上用和平方法加以解决。这种建议完全符合德国人民的利益、符合欧洲和平的利益。
    捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和罗马尼亚各报也都刊载了苏联政府的照会。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”和“团结报”全文刊载了苏联照会；地拉那电台于十八日晚全文转播了苏联照会。
    英法等国报纸广泛重视苏联照会
    资产阶级舆论承认必须慎重考虑
    苏联政府八月十五日致美、英、法三国政府建议立即采取实际措施解决德国问题的照会，在西方国家里受到广泛的重视。进步的报纸言论指出苏联的照会提供了解决德国问题的切实办法，符合于德国人民与欧洲和平的利益。资产阶级的报纸的评论极为混乱，但也承认苏联政府的这个照会不容忽视，必须慎重考虑。
    据塔斯社讯：英国“工人日报”对苏联的照会表示衷心欢迎。“工人日报”社论说：“这一照会是和平解决今日世界上的悬而未决的问题的极其重要的一个步骤。它的建议是远大的，又是切合实际的。”
    英国许多其他报纸都刊载了照会的摘要。各报评论莫衷一是。“每日电讯与晨邮报”驻柏林记者写道：“这个照会作了重大的让步，因此使西方处于窘境，这已经是西方所普遍承认的了。”“每日先驱报”社论说：“几乎是肯定的，西方对于照会是不会满意的。”该报建议同意邱吉尔所提出的举行无既定议程的高级会谈的建议。“泰晤士报”和另外一些报纸说，苏联提出这个照会，是有意破坏阿登纳在未来的选举中获胜的希望。
    法国“人道报”刊载了苏联照会的全文。“人道报”在评论中指出，苏联的照会符合德国人民的合法愿望，也完全符合法国人民的利益以及维护和平的需要。“解放报”认为苏联提出的关于对德和约的主要建议是“非常合乎情理”的。“解放报”着重指出华盛顿方面对苏联照会的第一个反应是采取敌对态度。同时对于阿登纳对苏联照会的敌对反应表示不满。
    法国的其他报纸也纷纷发表评论。“义勇军报”称苏联照会是“出人意外的”。“费加罗报”说，苏联照会建议成立临时政府以及把德国中立化的建议，西方国家是不会同意的。
    荷兰海牙的“电讯报”称苏联的照会是对大西洋阵线所曾发动的最强有力的外交进攻。该报说：现在，必须弄清楚：西欧组织在德国是否得到支持——譬如说得到大多数选民的支持。
    意大利所有报纸都以显著地位刊登了关于苏联照会的消息。“团结报”以“苏联主张立刻组成一个统一的德国政府”为大标题，并且评论说，照会的 “用意是为达成协议，解决德国问题开辟道路”。“现代报”的大标题说：“莫斯科向西方国家提出统一德国的建议”。“报信者报”的大标题说， “苏联要求举行对德和会”。
    比利时所有的报纸都以大标题登出了苏联照会的详细摘要。“红旗报”的一条标题说：“苏联政府最近致法、英、美三国政府的照会，为及早解决德国问题提供了可能性。”
    十七日维也纳各晚报首页登载关于苏联政府照会的消息。“晚报”详述了苏联照会，特别指出照会谈到减轻德国由于战争而担负的财政与经济义务的地方。
    美国报纸也把苏联政府就德国问题照会三国政府作为重要消息。“纽约时报”评论苏联照会在华盛顿官员之间引起的反应说：“莫斯科的照会使华盛顿的外交界人士感到意外与困惑。”该报驻柏林记者写道：“一般的意见认为，德国人要求恢复德国统一的愿望是如此强烈，以致要直接拒绝苏联照会在政治上是危险的。”
    美国国务院规避发表正面意见
    据塔斯社华盛顿十九日讯：美国国务院发言人里普就苏联政府关于德国问题的照会向报界发表声明。国务院避免说明它对苏联照会的要点的意见，只是说苏联照会似乎把三国所建议举行的四国外长会议推迟到明年再举行，虽然苏联照会并没有提到这一点。（新华社）
