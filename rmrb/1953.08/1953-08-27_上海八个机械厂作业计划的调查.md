    Investigation of the Operation Plans of Eight Machinery Factories in Shanghai
    Working Group of the Industrial Department of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Recently, we conducted a preliminary investigation into the operation plans of eight factories in Shanghai, including Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, Qiujiang Machine Factory, Universal Machine Factory, Huatong Electric Machinery Factory, Daxin Machine Factory, Wusong Machine Factory, Pujiang Machine Factory, and Shanghai Tool Factory. We have learned the following materials:
    With the exception of the Shanghai Tool Factory, the other seven factories have made significant progress in fulfilling the state plan in the first half of the year, and each factory has also made some improvements in production management; however, in terms of formulating and implementing operation plans, the foundation of other factories is very weak, except for the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, which has some foundation.
    When formulating operation plans, the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, although it cannot take all factors into account, has generally been able to consider various factors such as enterprise product planning, labor productivity, technical organization measures, and production preparation in the operation plan in recent months. The production section and workshops can also actively contact the relevant production preparation departments and sign contact contracts to determine the progress and use this as an assessment of the performance of each department in executing the operation plan. In addition, in addition to compiling monthly progress plans, each major workshop and work section also prepares weekly operation progress plans every seven days based on changing conditions for adjustment. Because the specific tasks of the factory were determined later, the production preparation time was short, and materials and outsourced parts were often out of sync. The short-term operation plan played a certain role in regulating these changing situations.
    When formulating operation plans, the other seven factories generally had incomplete information and incomplete considerations, so there were many problems with the operation plans. These seven factories generally lacked accurate information on the actual working hours and work-in-progress in the previous month. They considered the use of equipment, labor organization, machine tool repair, idle working hours, and parts scrap rate even less. In particular, they did not seriously consider the reserves and supply of tools, materials, castings, drawings, etc., which often disrupt the operation plan when preparing the plan. Although some factories considered it, they failed to propose improvement measures in time, so these weak links still disrupt the plan every month. Secondly, the processing workshops of Pujiang, Wusong, Daxin, Tool, and Huatong factories have calendar plans, but other workshops and relevant functional departments do not. Only one section of electric hoists in the Universal Factory and only the gear processing workshop in the Qiujiang Factory have scheduled calendar plans. Other processing sections and processing workshops only have a month's worth of parts processing tasks and no calendar schedule. On the other hand, the workshops in these seven factories that have monthly progress schedules have not yet developed short-term calendar plans. Because short-term operation plans are not made according to changing conditions, and the management foundation is poor, there are many changing factors, so the monthly operation plan is often disrupted after three days, five days, or ten days in most work sections. After the plan is disrupted, the calendar plan is put aside, and production returns to relying on urging parts according to assembly needs.
    The reasons why the operation plans of these seven factories were disrupted are not only the rough and unrealistic planning itself, but also the disconnection of materials and tools, the chaotic management of drawings, the large number of scrapped castings, the untimely repairs, and the lax inspection system. For example, in the meter workshop of Huatong Factory, many drawings lacked tolerances, the inspection standards were unclear, and the measuring tools were few and the inspection work was poor, so many parts were found to be substandard after inspection and arrived in the assembly workshop, so they had to be returned for repair in large quantities. In June, the number of returned products in this workshop accounted for almost 100%. In this case, the workshop calendar plan could not be maintained. For example, the switch workshop of the factory determined the specific tasks later, and the factory did not shorten the production cycle according to this situation, so many materials, tools, outsourced parts, and drawings could not be supplied in time in the second quarter, causing serious work stoppages waiting for materials. Under this situation, the operation plan had to be disrupted. The main reason why the Wusong Factory's operation plan was disrupted was the gray material and scrap of blanks; in July, three batches of materials in the processing workshop were scrapped after processing. Due to reasons such as sand holes in castings, gray material, changes in drawings, and processing negligence in Qiujiang Factory, many parts were scrapped in batches. For example, the qualification rate of the large parts section in the second quarter was only 40%, and sand holes in castings and gray material accounted for more than half of the scrap. In addition, the large parts tools, such as the boring tool, had problems and were not repaired for a long time, making it impossible for production to proceed normally. For example, the Daxin Factory often found errors in drawings until assembly, so rework and repairs were carried out, and the work was rushed and chaotic, making it impossible to implement the operation plan. The reasons why the operation plans of other factories could not be implemented and were disrupted were mostly caused by problems such as materials, blanks, tools, drawings, equipment maintenance, and unsound inspection systems. Therefore, some workers said: As long as the four major problems (referring to blanks, tools, drawings, and repairs) can be guaranteed to be solved, we will have no problem exceeding the quota.
    The dispatching work of the above eight factories is relatively sound, except for the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory's dispatching organization and dispatching work, while the rest of the factories are still being established. At present, in addition to the dispatching team under the production section, the dispatching organization in the workshops is extremely unsound. The construction section and the supply and marketing section do not have dispatchers. The most unsound are Pujiang and Daxin factories. Only individual workshops have dispatchers, and the total number of dispatchers in the factory is only three or five. The quality is also poor. Some of them are transferred from apprentices, and some are new to the factory and unfamiliar with the business, so the effect is not great. At present, the working methods of dispatchers in most factories are still based on the needs of the assembly workshop to ask the processing workshop for parts; often, in the middle or at the end of each month, when the assembly side finds that parts are lacking, the dispatchers are busy making up for the missing parts and are busy being passive and exhausted to deal with it. According to the above situation, we believe that the most urgent problem to be solved in the dispatching work of most factories is to first establish the dispatching organization; in terms of working methods, we should strive to change from passive to active as the operation plan is improved. At present, the combination of production scheduling and organizational measures is very poor. For example, the rework, repair, and scrap problems of each factory are either not found by the dispatcher in time, or the dispatcher raised them but they are not resolved in time, some old problems are dragged down, and no active and effective measures are taken to solve them. Some major problems cannot be handled by the dispatcher, and the factory director or workshop director must preside over them in person to solve them. Because this aspect is done very poorly, the dispatching work is weak and weak. This is also one of the important reasons why the operation plan cannot be implemented.
    In short, the planning and management work is generally still in a chaotic state, which is the basic situation of these factories.

    上海八个机械厂作业计划的调查
    中共中央华东局工业部工作组
    最近，我们初步调查了上海电机厂、虬江机器厂、通用机器厂、华通电机厂、大鑫机器厂、吴淞机器厂、浦江机器厂、上海工具厂等八个厂的作业计划情况，了解了下面一些材料：
    除上海工具厂以外，其他七个厂上半年在完成国家计划方面，都有显著进步，各厂在生产管理方面也有若干改进；但在制订和贯彻作业计划方面，除上海电机厂稍有一些基础外，其他厂的基础都很薄弱。
    上海电机厂在编制作业计划时，虽还不能将各种因素都考虑进去，但近几个月来，对企业产品计划、劳动生产率、技术组织措施和生产准备中各项因素，一般还能考虑在作业计划之内。生产科、车间还能主动地和有关生产准备的科室取得联系，并签订联系合同，定出进度，并以此作为考核各科室执行作业计划的成绩。此外，各主要车间、工段除了编月的进度计划之外，每七天还根据变化情况，排出周的作业进度计划，以资调整。该厂因具体任务确定得较迟，生产准备时间短，材料和外包零件经常脱节；有了短期作业计划，对调节这些变动的情况起了一定的作用。
    其他七个厂在制订作业计划时，一般都是资料不全，考虑不周，因而作业计划存在不少问题。这七个厂一般对上个月的实作工时情况和在制品情况都缺少正确资料。对设备运用、劳动组织、机床修理、闲置工时、零件报废率等考虑得更少。特别是对经常打乱作业计划的因素——如工具、材料、铸件、图纸等储备及供应情况，在编计划时都没有认真下功夫考虑。有的厂虽然考虑了，但未能及时提出改进措施，因而这些薄弱环节仍然每个月在打乱着计划。其次，浦江、吴淞、大鑫、工具、华通各厂的加工车间有了日历计划，但其他车间和有关职能科却还没有。通用厂只是电动葫芦一个工段、虬江厂只是齿轮加工车间排了日历计划，其他加工工段和加工车间只排了一个月的零件加工任务，并没有日历进度表。另一方面，这七个厂在有了月的进度表的车间，都还没有排出短期的日历计划。因为没有根据变化情况排出短期作业计划，再加管理基础还差，变化因素很多，因而月的作业计划往往执行了三天、五天或一旬之后，多数工段就被打乱了。计划被打乱后，日历计划就被放在一边，又回到根据装配需要，靠催零件进行生产了。
    这七个厂作业计划被打乱的原因，除了计划本身编制得粗糙和不够切合实际外，材料、工具脱节，图纸管理混乱，铸件大量报废，检修不按时，检验制度不严，也都是打乱作业计划的重要原因。如华通厂的电表车间由于不少图纸缺乏公差，检验标准不明，再加上量具少，检验工作差，因而有许多零件经检验后到了装配车间又发现不合标准，只好大量退修。六月份该车间退修品几乎占百分之百。在这种情况下，车间日历计划自然无法维持了。又如该厂开关车间确定具体任务较迟，该厂又没有根据这一情况缩短生产周期，因而第二季度中很多材料、工具、外包零件和图样不能及时供应，造成严重的停工待料。在此情况下，作业计划就不能不被打乱了。吴淞厂作业计划被打乱的主要原因是材料夹灰和毛坯报废；该厂加工车间七月份就有三批材料加工后全部报废。虬江厂因铸件有砂眼、材料夹灰、图纸更改及加工疏忽等原因，零件中成批报废的很多，如大件工段第二季度的合格率只有百分之四十，而报废中铸件砂眼、材料夹灰占一半以上。加之大件的工具如搪刀出了毛病，很长时间未修好，致使生产无法正常进行。再如大鑫厂常因图纸发生错误，直到装配时才被发现，于是返工退修，突击忙乱，致使作业计划无法推行。其他厂的作业计划不能贯彻和被打乱的原因，也大都是材料、毛坯、工具、图纸、设备检修等问题和检验制度不健全所引起的，因此有的工人就讲：只要四大问题（指毛坯、工具、图纸、检修）能保证解决，我们超额没有问题。
    上述八个厂的调度工作，除上海电机厂调度组织及调度工作比较健全一些外，其余厂都还正在建立。各厂现除生产科下设有调度小组外，车间调度组织极不健全，施工科、供销科都没有调度员。其中最不健全的是浦江、大鑫两厂，只有个别车间有调度员，全厂的调度人员不过三、五人，质量又差，有的是艺徒转来的，有的是新到工厂，业务生疏，因而作用不大。目前多数厂调度员的工作方法，还只是根据装配车间的需要，向加工车间要零件；往往到了每月中旬或月末装配方面发现缺乏零件时，调度员才忙于补缺件，忙乱被动，穷于应付。根据上述情况，我们认为多数厂在调度工作方面目前急需解决的问题是首先把调度机构建立起来；在工作方法上，应随着作业计划的健全而力求转被动为主动。目前生产调度工作与组织措施结合得很差，如各厂的返工退修、报废问题，或者由于调度员没有及时查出，或者是调度员提出了而没有及时解决，有的是老问题拖下来，没有积极采取有效措施加以解决，有些重大问题不是调度员所能处理的，必须厂长或车间主任亲自主持才能解决。因为这方面作得很差，就使得调度工作软弱无力。这也是使得作业计划不能贯彻的重要原因之一。
    总之，计划管理工作一般尚处在混乱状态，就是这几个厂的基本情况。
