	After completing typical pilot programs in the Northeast and Southwest, the first phase of grassroots election work has been launched.

	The grassroots election preparations in the entire Northeast region are nearing completion, and most provinces and cities have successively begun the first batch of grassroots elections.

	During the preparation stage, the election committees of the eleven provinces and cities in Northeast China have drawn more than 75,000 cadres for the general election, and so far, more than 9,300 leading cadres have been trained. These cadres have been dispatched to various counties one after another. The work of training cadres at the county level has also been completed in late July.

	In order to ensure the smooth progress of the general election, the eleven provinces and cities in Northeast China conducted typical pilot programs for the general election in 77 urban and rural grassroots units starting in May, and gained relatively rich experience. Various cities have also rectified street organizations and established street residents' committees. Cities such as Shenyang, Dalian, and Harbin have rectified urban household registrations, creating favorable conditions for population surveys and voter registration. In addition, extensive publicity and education work has been carried out everywhere; all organs and organizations have also studied the general election documents.

	From the beginning of July, the first batch of grassroots election work in the provinces and cities of Northeast China was launched in batches. Before departure, the general election work teams in various places studied the work experience gained in the typical pilot programs. Yushu, Jiaohe, Fuyu, Jiutai, Panshi and other counties in Jilin Province, which started earlier, successively dispatched 230 grassroots general election work teams in early July, and began the first batch of grassroots election work in one-third or one-ninth of the villages within each county. The rural grassroots elections in Songjiang, Liaodong, and Heilongjiang provinces will be launched universally during the hoeing period in August. Fushun City, which started the urban grassroots election work earlier, will elect representatives to the district people's congress at the end of July. Cities such as Anshan and Benxi have launched election work in various villages in the suburbs, and will gradually move into the urban areas.

	In order to strengthen guidance on grassroots election work in various places, the Northeast Administrative Committee has transferred more than 400 cadres to Fushun, Rehe, Anshan, Yanbian, Liaoxi, Changchun and other places in mid-July to participate in urban and rural grassroots election work. In addition, five inspection teams were formed to inspect the general election work in Shenyang, Fushun, Benxi, Jilin, Harbin and other places.

	The first phase of grassroots election work in the Southwest region has been widely launched in areas with a population of 15 million. The first phase of grassroots elections in Sichuan Province includes more than 100 counties and approximately 2,000 townships. At present, most townships have completed population surveys and voter registration, and are about to enter the stage of deliberating on representative candidates. Guizhou Province started the first phase of grassroots election work in all counties in the province from the beginning of July, and the general election work in one-third of the province will be completed before the autumn harvest. The grassroots election work in the Han areas and ethnic minority areas that have completed land reform in Xikang Province will be carried out in two phases. Now, Ya'an City and 21 counties in the province have 291 townships and towns, accounting for more than one-half of the province's population, have begun the general election work. Most of the townships have announced the list of voters and are nominating representative candidates.

	Before the start of the first phase of grassroots elections in the Southwest region, all provinces completed a series of preparations. Sichuan Province has completed the pilot general elections in four townships, providing rich experience for the first phase of grassroots election work. Most areas of Guizhou Province have convened people's representative conferences of all ethnic groups and circles to discuss and deploy grassroots election work. At the same time, youth leagues, women's federations and other organizations have actively cooperated to mobilize young people and women to participate in the general election. Extensive publicity activities for the general election have also been carried out in various places. Staff members of cultural centers in Ya'an, Tianquan, Hanyuan and other counties in Xikang Province carried a large number of propaganda tools such as projectors, radios, gramophones, and pictures to the countryside to carry out propaganda. The staff of Hanyuan County Cultural Center carried radios and gramophones to the fields during the day to publicize during the farmers' production intervals. Folk artists in Tianquan County went to the countryside to sing "Select People's Representatives Carefully" and "Unity in the Mutual Aid Group," which were easy to understand and very popular among the masses. The teachers of Shuanghe Township, Xichong County, Sichuan Province, guaranteed to run a blackboard newspaper in each village to actively carry out the publicity of the general election.

	Because the general election is closely integrated with production, the general election work in the above-mentioned areas has effectively promoted agricultural production. The cadres participating in the general election in various places actively participated in various agricultural activities and were welcomed by the people. During the publicity of the general election in Nanke Township, Dejiang County, Guizhou Province, more than 15,000 piculs of rice paddies suffered from drought. The township election committee immediately mobilized more than 400 farmers to build 10 large dikes and 3 river embankments, ensuring the irrigation of more than 7,000 piculs of rice paddies. The masses were very satisfied, so 80% of the adults in the township participated in the general election. In the areas where the general election was carried out in Baoxing, Ya'an, Xichang and other counties in Xikang Province, insect pests occurred. The cadres of the general election work groups in various places also organized the masses in a timely manner to quickly eliminate the insect pests, so that the people could participate in the general election with peace of mind. The work cadres in various places are also very concerned about the lives of the masses. The work cadres of Chuxi Village, Tongren County, Guizhou Province learned that some of the masses in the village had difficulties in their lives, and they immediately organized farmers to carry out sideline production such as burning lime, weaving straw hats, and weaving palm fans to improve the lives of the masses. The work cadres in some areas immediately told the local People's Bank about the shortage of agricultural tools and cattle among the masses, and the farmers quickly obtained various government loans to overcome the difficulties in production. The work style of these cadres generally gave the masses a good impression, and some farmers praised them with the words "The boat carries a thousand catties, relying solely on the helmsman."

    东北、西南完成典型试办后
    展开第一期基层选举工作
    东北全区的基层选举准备工作已临近结束，大部分省、市都相继开始了第一批基层选举。
    在准备阶段中，东北全区十一个省、市选举委员会共抽调普选工作干部七万五千多人，到目前止，已训练完九千三百多名领导干部，这些干部已先后分赴各县。以县为单位的训练干部的工作，也已在七月下旬完成。
    为了使普选工作顺利进行，东北十一个省、市从五月份开始，曾在七十七个城、乡基层单位进行了普选的典型试办工作，取得了较为丰富的经验。各城市还整顿了街道组织，建立了街道居民委员会。沈阳、旅大、哈尔滨等市都整顿了城市户口，给人口调查和选民登记创造了便利条件。此外，各地都进行了广泛的宣传教育工作；各机关、团体也都学习了普选文件。
    从七月初旬开始，东北各省、市的第一批基层选举工作便陆续地分批展开。各地普选工作队在出发以前，都学习了典型试办中已取得的工作经验。开始较早的吉林省榆树、蛟河、扶余、九台、磐石等县，在七月初旬相继派出了二百三十个基层普选工作队，在各该县内三分之一或九分之一的村内开始了第一批基层选举工作。松江、辽东、黑龙江省的农村基层选举，将在八月份挂锄期间普遍展开。城市基层选举工作开始较早的抚顺市，七月末即可选出区人民代表大会的代表。鞍山、本溪等市，已在郊区各村展开选举工作，将逐步转入市区。
    为加强对各地基层选举工作的指导，东北行政委员会已抽调四百多名干部，于七月中旬分赴抚顺、热河、鞍山、延边、辽西、长春等地参加城乡的基层选举工作。此外，并组成五个检查组分赴沈阳、抚顺、本溪、吉林、哈尔滨等地检查普选工作。

    西南区第一期基层选举工作，已先后在一千五百万人口的地区广泛展开。四川省第一期基层选举，包括一百多个县和所属的二千个左右的乡。目前大部分乡已完成人口调查、选民登记工作，即将进入酝酿代表候选人的阶段。贵州省从七月上旬起，在全省各县开始了第一期基层选举工作，全省有三分之一地区的普选工作将在秋收前完成。西康省完成土地改革的汉族地区和民族聚居区的基层选举工作将分两期进行。现在全省已有雅安市和二十一个县的二百九十一个乡、镇，约占全省二分之一以上人口的地区开始了普选工作。其中大部分乡已公布了选民名单，正在进行代表候选人提名。
    西南区第一期基层选举开始前，各省都完成了一系列的准备工作。四川省已完成了四个乡的普选试办工作，给第一期基层选举工作提供了丰富的经验。贵州省大部地区都召开了各族各界人民代表会议，讨论和布置了基层选举工作，同时各地青年团、妇女联合会等组织都作了有力的配合，积极发动青年、妇女参加普选活动。各地还广泛展开了普选的宣传活动。西康省雅安、天全、汉源等县文化馆的工作人员都携带了幻灯、收音机、留声机、图片等大批宣传工具，下乡进行宣传。汉源县文化馆的工作人员，在白天把收音机、留声机背到田间利用农民生产空隙时间来宣传。天全县的民间艺人下乡演唱了“认真选好人民代表”、“互助组内要团结”等花鼓词，内容通俗易懂，很受群众欢迎。四川省西充县双和乡的教师们保证在每村办好一块黑板报，积极进行普选的宣传。
    由于密切地结合生产进行普选，因此，上述地区的普选工作有效地推动了农业生产。各地参加普选的干部都积极参加各种农事活动，受到人民群众的欢迎。贵州省德江县南客乡在宣传普选时有一万五千多挑田遭受旱灾，该乡选举委员会立即动员了四百多农民兴修了十条大堰和三道河堤，保证了七千多挑田的灌溉，群众非常满意，因此全乡有百分之八十的成年人参加了普选活动。西康省宝兴、雅安、西昌等县开展普选的地区发生虫害，各地普选工作组干部也及时组织群众迅速扑灭虫害，使人民群众安心参加普选活动。各地工作干部对群众的生活也非常关心，贵州省铜仁县楚溪屯乡工作干部了解到该乡部分群众生活有困难，他们即组织农民进行烧石灰、编草帽、编棕扇等副业生产，改善了群众的生活。有的地区工作干部将群众缺乏农具与耕牛情况立即告诉当地人民银行，农民们很快得到了政府的各种贷款，克服了生产中的困难。这些干部的工作作风普遍给群众以良好的印象，有的农民用“船载千斤重，专靠掌舵人”这样的话来称赞他们。（新华社）
