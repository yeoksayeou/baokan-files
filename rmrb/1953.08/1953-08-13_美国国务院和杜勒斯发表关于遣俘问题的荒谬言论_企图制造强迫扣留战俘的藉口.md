Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 12th. Special correspondent Wu Min reports: After the American propaganda machine went into full swing and fabricated a large number of lies such as the "mistreatment" of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese sides, the US State Department and Dulles, who were originally hiding behind the scenes, have officially stepped forward. On the 8th, the US State Department issued a statement, pretending to express its "grave concern" that the Korean and Chinese sides "may not intend to repatriate all the prisoners of war in their hands." It also said: "We insist on such a clause in the armistice agreement: that any so-called UN prisoners of war who do not wish to be repatriated must be handed over to the Repatriation Commission for custody…This will include any prisoners of war so-called 'sentenced,' without any exception." Then, US Secretary of State Dulles made a statement at a press conference on the 10th, openly admitting that they had forcibly detained a "large number" of our personnel who insisted on repatriation, and used rogue language to blackmail, saying that the United States would insist that the Korean and Chinese sides repatriate all UN prisoners of war, even those who have been sentenced. If this is not done, "we will probably have to take retaliatory measures against the prisoners we are detaining." He said:

“We have a large number of Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war in our hands who have been convicted of serious crimes. Of course, they cannot be repatriated until the Communist side repatriates our prisoners of war who have been convicted by them."

What is the basis for the US side's demand that any convicted prisoners of war must be repatriated? People have searched through all the clauses of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and cannot find a provision like the one advocated by the US side. However, the US side's claim violates the Geneva Convention. As everyone knows, Article 119 of the Geneva Convention stipulates: "Prisoners of war against whom criminal proceedings are pending may be detained until the end of such proceedings and, if necessary, until the completion of the punishment. The same applies to prisoners of war already convicted of criminal offences." Therefore, if a prisoner of war is to be prosecuted or sentenced for a crime, it should be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention, and there is no reason to deal with it in accordance with the US side's claims. It is not surprising that the US side has put forward such a absurd claim that ignores the Geneva Convention. For several years, the US side has consistently disregarded the Geneva Convention in prisoner-of-war camps, arbitrarily killing and mistreating prisoners of war.

However, what is particularly worthy of people's vigilance is that behind this blatant disregard for the Korean Armistice Agreement and the Geneva Convention lies an even more vicious conspiracy. The reason why the US side is painstakingly fabricating lies to slander the Korean and Chinese sides for detaining prisoners of war, Dulles's so-called "retaliatory measures," and the so-called that the United States "has a large number of Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war in its hands who have been convicted of serious crimes" is to create excuses to detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in large numbers and obstruct the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

This trick of the US side is nothing new. As early as April and May this year, during the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, the US side played this trick. An Associated Press dispatch from Munsan on the 6th admitted that the US side had "detained some people" at that time, and that "three thousand Chinese and North Korean sick and wounded prisoners of war, who could have been repatriated in April," were forcibly detained by the US side. In order to cover up this behavior, the US side also fabricated similar lies, saying that the Korean and Chinese sides had "detained" some sick and wounded prisoners of war. However, as everyone knows, the Korean and Chinese sides, in accordance with the agreement and the Geneva Convention, repatriated all the sick and wounded prisoners of war of the other side who could be repatriated at that time, except for a few sick and wounded prisoners of war whose condition was not suitable for travel due to the war situation. The clumsy lies of the US side only exposed its deliberate conspiracy to detain our sick and wounded personnel.

Before the realization of the Korean armistice, the US side condoned Syngman Rhee in forcibly detaining more than 27,000 of our prisoners of war. After the realization of the Korean armistice, the US side is still continuing to forcibly detain our prisoners of war without repatriating them. The Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who recently returned reported that as late as July 28, the day after the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, the US side transported away 102 of our prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation from the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp. On the same day, the US side also used force against our prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation in the No. 1 prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, attempting to forcibly detain them. Because our prisoners of war refused to submit, the American guards finally used poison gas bombs. According to reliable sources, from August 3, the US side again carried out large-scale forced "screening" of our prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation on Geoje Island, forcibly detaining many prisoners of war.

The US side obviously knows that as more and more Korean and Chinese prisoners of war return to the Korean and Chinese sides, their conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war by using all kinds of horrific and brutal means will be completely exposed. Therefore, they cannot but create "reasons" for their forcible detention of prisoners of war in a panic. They are trying to use this lie to create obstacles in advance for the political conference and shirk their responsibility for recovering the more than 27,000 prisoners of war forcibly detained by Syngman Rhee. But their hands and feet are obviously too flustered, so that their true colors are revealed. While Dulles slandered the Korean and Chinese sides for not intending to repatriate all the prisoners of war, he also said, "It is still too early to know for sure whether any prisoners of war have actually been detained." When Dulles said this, he carelessly branded the mark of "liar" on his own forehead.

### 美国国务院和杜勒斯发表关于遣俘问题的荒谬言论  企图制造强迫扣留战俘的藉口

    美国国务院和杜勒斯发表关于遣俘问题的荒谬言论
    企图制造强迫扣留战俘的藉口
    【新华社开城十二日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：在美国宣传机器全力开动、大量制造诬蔑朝中方面“虐待”战俘等谎话之后，原来躲在幕后的美国国务院和杜勒斯正式出场了。八日美国国务院发表了一篇声明，装模作样地表示，它“非常关心”朝中方面“可能不打算遣返在他们手中的全部战俘”。并说什么：“我们坚持停战协定中这样一个条款：即规定任何所谓不愿遣返的联合国军战俘必须交给遣返委员会看管，……这将包括任何所谓被判‘徒刑’的战俘，不得有任何例外。”接着，美国国务卿杜勒斯于十日在记者招待会上发表谈话，他公开承认他们已经强迫扣留了“大量”坚持遣返的我方被俘人员，并用流氓口吻来进行讹诈，说美国将坚持要朝中方面把所有联军战俘，甚至连那些被判徒刑的战俘都遣返，如果不这样，“我们大概会要在我们所扣留的俘虏身上采取报复的措施”。他说：
    “我们手中有大量的中国和北朝鲜战俘已因犯有严重的罪行而被判罪了。当然，在共方把他们判罪的我方战俘遣返给我们之前，他们是不能被遣返的。”
    美国国务院和杜勒斯要求任何被判罪的战俘都必须要遣返，这究竟有什么根据呢？人们翻遍朝鲜停战协定的全部条款，是找不出有一条像美方所主张的那样的规定的。但是，美方的这种主张恰恰违反日内瓦公约。大家都知道，日内瓦公约第一百十九条规定：“战俘因刑事上之犯罪将被诉追者，得将其拘留至该项程序终结为止，必要时，至刑罚执行完毕为止。此项规定，对于因刑事上之犯罪业已定罪之战俘亦适用之。”因此，如果有战俘因犯罪而将被诉追或被判刑，就应该按照日内瓦公约的规定处理，而没有丝毫理由要按照美方的主张来处理。美方提出这种无视日内瓦公约的誖谬主张是并不奇怪的。几年来，美方在战俘营中本来就是一贯不顾日内瓦公约，任意屠杀和虐待战俘的。
    但是，特别值得人们警惕的是，在这种公然无视朝鲜停战协定和日内瓦公约的叫嚣后面，还隐藏着更恶毒的阴谋。美方所以不厌其烦地制造出诬蔑朝中方面扣留战俘的谎话，杜勒斯所谓要采取“报复的措施”，所谓美国“手中有大量的中国和北朝鲜战俘已因犯有严重的罪行而被判罪”，其目的在于制造藉口，来大批扣留朝中被俘人员，阻挠朝鲜停战协定的实施。
    美方这一套手法已经不是什么新花样。早在今年四、五月间交换病伤战俘时，美方就曾经玩过这个手段。美联社汶山六日电就曾承认：美方在当时“扣留了一些人”，“有三千名中国和北朝鲜病伤战俘，本来在四月间就可以被遣返”，但却被美方横暴地扣留下来。美方为了掩饰这种行为，也制造了类似的谎话，说什么朝中方面“扣留”了一些病伤战俘。但是，大家知道，朝中方面按照协议和日内瓦公约，在当时除一部分在战事情况不适合于旅行的病伤战俘外，遣返了所有可以遣返的对方病伤战俘。美方的拙劣的谎言只是暴露出它蓄意扣留我方病伤人员的阴谋。
    在朝鲜停战实现之前，美方纵容李承晚强迫扣留了二万七千多名我方被俘人员，在朝鲜停战实现以后，美方仍在继续强迫扣留我方被俘人员，而不把他们遣返。最近遣返归来的朝中被俘人员曾报告：就在七月二十八日，朝鲜停战协定签订的第二天，美方还从济州岛战俘营押走坚持遣返的我方被俘人员一百零二人。同日，美方并对巨济岛第一战俘营坚持遣返的我方被俘人员使用武力，企图强迫扣留他们，因我方被俘人员拒不屈服，美国卫兵最后竟使用了毒瓦斯弹。另据可靠消息，美方从八月三日起，又在巨济岛上对坚持遣返的我方战俘大规模实行强迫“甄别”，强迫扣留了不少战俘。
    美方显然知道，由于越来越多的朝中被俘人员回到朝中方面，他们使用一切骇人听闻的残暴手段来强迫扣留战俘的阴谋将要全盘败露，因此不能不手忙脚乱地为他们强迫扣留战俘制造“理由”。他们企图用这种谎言来为政治会议预先设置障碍，并推卸他们对于追回被李承晚强迫扣留的二万七千多名战俘应负的责任。但是他们的手脚显然太慌乱了，以致露出了马脚。杜勒斯一面诬蔑朝中方面不打算遣返全部战俘，一方面却又说，“要确实知道是否有任何战俘真正已被扣留，为时尚属过早。”杜勒斯在说这句话的时候，就不小心地在他自己的额上烙上了“说谎者”的印子。
