Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army sick and wounded personnel who were repatriated on April 20th of this year are enjoying increasingly improved health and widespread weight gain under the careful care of medical personnel in rear hospitals of the motherland.

Our captured sick and wounded personnel suffered greatly in American POW camps, and many became skin and bones. However, after returning to the motherland and undergoing short-term treatment and recuperation, their health has rapidly recovered, and their weight has generally increased. For example, Zhang Wuxian, one of the sick and wounded personnel, weighed only 43 kilograms when he was first weighed in early May, but by July 13th, he had increased to 66 kilograms. According to statistics from a rear hospital on the weight of 271 sick and wounded personnel from May 20th to June 23rd, the average weight gain per person was 3.08 kilograms in one month and three days.

    被遣返的志愿军病伤人员
    健康情形日益好转体重增加
    据新华社讯：在今年四月二十日被遣返回国的中国人民志愿军病伤人员，在祖国后方医院医护人员精心护理下，健康情形日益好转，体重普遍增加。
    我方被俘病伤人员在美方战俘营里备受摧残，许多人瘦得皮包骨头，但是，他们回到祖国，经过短期的治疗和休养后，健康迅速恢复了，体重也普遍增加了。如病伤人员中的张武先在五月上旬第一次量体重时，只有四十三公斤，到七月十三日就增加到六十六公斤了。根据某后方医院五月二十日到六月二十三日对二百七十一名病伤人员体重情况的统计材料，在一个月零三天中，平均每人体重增加了三点○八公斤。
