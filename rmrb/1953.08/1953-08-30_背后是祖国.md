    Behind Them is the Motherland
    Zhan Wenbao
    In the coastal defense area, I met many soldiers. During their breaks from regular studies, they habitually read newspapers and discussed current affairs together. They had a wealth of common knowledge about the industrial development of Anshan, the Huai River project, and other economic constructions. They had a very correct understanding of the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Some soldiers carried newspapers in their pockets so that they could cite materials and draw correct conclusions on issues that were being debated. In one squad's residence, I saw two People's Daily newspapers hanging on the wall, each page marked with fingerprints and sweat stains. The squad leader said proudly, "The soldiers subscribed to them." I understood that this was the profound change in military life brought about by cultural education.
    On the coast, I saw soldiers chatting about their learning experiences after completing strenuous operations. The focus of the discussion was the economic construction of the motherland. One soldier said, "Hao Jianxiu is really amazing. She's only eighteen years old, and she's already made such a great contribution. If all textile factories in the country adopted her working methods, they would save tens of millions in wealth every year!" Another soldier, holding his submachine gun to his chest, interjected, "That goes without saying, all textile factories across the country are already learning from Hao Jianxiu's working methods. Sometimes, I seem to see many textile workers, all wearing white work clothes, white headscarves, sleeves rolled up to their elbows, busy tending to the spindles. The spindles are whirring, cotton goes in on one side of the factory, and cloth comes out on the other, so much cloth! Soon your wives and children will be wearing colorful clothes!" His delightful words brought hearty and cheerful laughter from the soldiers.
    In the club of this company, I also saw a soldier drawing a cartoon. The scene was a large-scale factory, with a dense forest of chimneys standing above it; the northwest wind was blowing the thick smoke from the chimneys diagonally. The cultural troupe comrade who was teaching him to draw praised him for his rapid progress, but this comrade stared at the picture for a long, long time, pondering deeply. Finally, he said, "No, comrade, there's still a railway missing! You know, this is a very large factory. If there isn't a railway, how can the raw materials be supplied! And how can the products be transported out?" So, he lightly drew a railway leading into the distance in the background of the picture. This proves that the soldiers' thoughts and feelings are completely linked with the construction of the motherland. The political instructor of this company told me that if a week goes by without a newspaper, the soldiers feel like they've lost something precious. He quoted a soldier as saying, "If we don't constantly know about the country's construction, there's not much meaning in our training, learning politics, and studying culture every day." He described the scene of the soldiers cheering when the news of the country's first Five-Year Plan arrived. Many soldiers even wrote articles to celebrate. One soldier wrote, "The realization of the Five-Year Plan will not only make the country further prosperous and strong, but also give us newer and more equipment to defend the motherland!" Look, that's how our soldiers understand the relationship between economic construction and national defense.
    One day at dusk, the scene was the same as usual. Fishermen were returning with sails in the wind from afar, seabirds were playing and chasing waves, wisps of smoke were rising from the coastal villages, and children were skipping home from school. However, the peaceful scene did not numb the vigilance of the coastal defense soldiers for a moment. At ten o'clock that night, after a burst of airplane engine noise, a burst of gunfire rang out on the coast. A platoon of our army, which had been making combat preparations at all times, had surrounded the enemy agents who had been parachuted down. In the pitch-black night, the soldiers groped and attacked in the grass. Half an hour later, seven bandits were captured, and five bandits were killed. The enemy's plot to sabotage the construction of our great motherland was once again smashed as usual.
    Li Yingxian, the third squad leader, was wounded in the battle. In the company headquarters, Li Yingxian lay quietly, unconscious due to excessive blood loss. The company commander and the comrades of the third squad stood beside him with heavy hearts.
    I know this squad leader. He usually liked to tell the new soldiers stories of going south, he said, "As soon as we crossed the river, we fought all the way to Zhennanguan. The weather was so hot then! We could still walk a hundred and fifty li a day. Everyone wanted to walk fast, walk fast! ... To rescue the people who were still suffering in front!" The comrades listened with wide eyes, listening to him continue to talk about suppressing bandits in Guangxi, about the cold wind and rain of the Yao Mountains in February, about how the comrades flew over the mountains and went deep into the bandit dens... But he habitually concluded, "This is only the first step of the Long March." Because he had this belief, after enduring the hardships of the battlefield, he led the soldiers to garrison the coast to defend the peaceful construction of the motherland. The company commander looked at Li Yingxian's gradually weakening breath and increasingly pale face, and reluctantly stroked his hand, the hand that had annihilated and captured so many enemies, bandits, and secret agents! The hand that had relieved the people of the motherland from so much suffering!
    After the doctor performed the operation, Li Yingxian gradually regained consciousness. He slowly opened his eyes, he smiled, and the comrades also smiled. He was smiling for the victory he had achieved, and the comrades were smiling for the brave and tenacious soldier who had finally awakened. The company commander comforted him while muttering to himself, "The rear of the motherland cannot be destroyed, as long as we are here, as long as you are here."
    Indeed, at this moment, it was approaching midnight, and the motherland was shrouded in the peaceful tranquility of the night. Villages and mountains were draped in starlight, rivers were flowing in the night, crops were swaying in the breeze, farmers who had been working all day and workers who had changed shifts were sleeping soundly, and babies who had not yet understood anything were slowly growing up in their mothers' arms! And writers were working at their desks, some of whom may have been writing about the battle stories of the coastal defense soldiers who were defending the construction of the motherland! To be passed on to future generations, so that people will never forget.
    Soon we arrived at this company again. After the troops finished their field exercises, the soldiers began their cultural and recreational activities. To the rhythm of the majestic and beautiful accordion music, the soldiers burst into song:
    We stand on the coastal defense front,
    Defending the safety of the motherland... How vast and beautiful is the motherland! We listen quietly to it breathing in peace...
    At this time, the company commander smiled and said to me, "The soldiers love the motherland even more now. In the past, they fought and traveled to many places, only knowing that the motherland has mountains, plains, villages, and cities... Now they think more and see farther. They know that the Northeast produces iron ore, Yumen produces oil, and Changbai Mountain has natural forests; they talk about the motherland as if they were talking about their own hometown..."
    We came to the seaside, where a majestic sentry stood, vigilantly watching the turbulent sea. Behind his mighty figure, our great motherland is growing and becoming stronger at a rapid pace. (Attached picture)

    背后是祖国
    詹文豹
    在海防地区，我遇到许多战士，他们在正课学习的空隙很习惯地在一起阅读报纸和谈论时事，他们有着关于鞍山工业、淮河工程和其他经济建设的丰富常识。他们对朝鲜问题的和平解决认识得十分正确。有的战士把报纸插在口袋里，以便在争论不下的问题上引证材料，作出正确的结论。在一个班的驻地，我看见墙上挂着两份人民日报，一张张都是指痕汗迹斑斑，班长得意地说：“战士们订的。”我明白了这就是文化教育所造成的部队生活的深刻变化。
    在海防上，我看见战士们在作完费力的操作之后漫谈学习心得的情景。问题中心是祖国的经济建设。一个战士说：“郝建秀真了不得，人家才十八岁，就有那么大的创造，全国各纺织厂要是都采用她的工作方法，每年节省的财富千千万呢！”另一个双手按着胸前冲锋枪的战士插言道：“那还用说，全国各纺织工厂早就在学习郝建秀的工作方法啦。有时，我好像看见许多纺织工人，都穿着白工作服，头披白布巾，袖子卷到胳臂弯，都在纱锭旁边忙着接线。纱锭轰轰的转，工厂这边进去的是棉花，那边出来的是布匹，好多的布匹呀！不久你们的女人、孩子都要穿花衣服啦！”他这番动听的话，引起了战士们响亮快活的笑声。
    在这个连队的俱乐部，我还看见一个战士在画漫画，布图是一个规模宏大的工厂，上面矗立着丛密如林的烟囱；西北风正吹斜着烟囱里吐出来的浓烟。教他画画的文工团同志在旁边称赞他进步快，但是这位同志还好久好久面对着这幅图画深思着，最后他说：“不，同志，还少一条铁路呢！你知道，这是规模很大的工厂，要是没有一条铁路，原料如何能供上！产品也运不出来呀。”于是，他在图画的背景上轻轻画了一条通向远方的铁路。这证明战士们的思想感情和祖国的建设完全联在一起了。这个连的指导员告诉我说：如果一个星期不来报纸，战士们真像失去了一件什么宝贵的东西一样。他引了一个战士的话说：“不经常知道国家的建设，我们天天练兵，学政治、学文化就没有多大意义了。”他描述了传来国家第一个五年计划的消息时，战士们欢呼的情景。很多战士并撰文庆祝。一个战士写道：“实现五年计划，不但使国家进一步富强，而且会使我们有更新更多的装备，来保卫祖国！”看，我们的战士就是这样来理解经济建设与国防建设的关系的。
    有一天黄昏，景象和往常一样，渔夫们从远处趁风归帆，海鸟在波浪上飞逐游戏，海边村庄升起了缕缕炊烟，放了学的孩子也跳跳蹦蹦地回家了。但是，和平的景象，丝毫也没有麻痹海防战士的一刻警惕。就在当夜十点钟，随着一阵飞机的马达轰鸣之后，在海边就响起了一阵枪声，原来时刻在做着战斗准备的我军一个排已经把敌人空降下来的特务包围起来了，漆黑的夜色中，战士们在草莽中摸索攻击，半个钟头后，七个匪徒被俘，五个匪徒毙命，敌人破坏我们伟大祖国建设的阴谋照例又被粉碎了。
    三班长李应先在战斗中负了伤。在连部，李应先安静地躺着，他因流血过多昏过去了。连长和三班的同志们心情沉痛地站在他的身边。
    我认识这位班长。平时他喜欢给新战士讲南下故事，他说：“我们一过江就一直打到镇南关，当时天气多么热！一天还能走一百五十里。大家都巴不得快走呀，走呀！……好去解救前面还在苦难中的老百姓！”同志们都听得睁大了眼睛，听他继续讲广西剿匪，讲傜山二月的寒风冷雨，讲同志们如何飞越山岭深入匪窠……但是他习惯地作结论说：“这才是万里长征走完第一步。”正因为他有这个信念，因此在饱受沙场风霜之后，又带领着战士们屯驻海边捍卫祖国的和平建设。连长看着李应先逐渐微弱的呼吸和愈来愈苍白的脸，依依不舍似地抚摸着他的手，这双手歼灭和俘掳过多少敌人匪军，土匪和特务啊！这双手给祖国的人民解除过多少苦难啊！
    医生施完手术后，李应先渐渐清醒了过来。他慢慢睁开了眼睛，他笑了，同志们也笑了。他在为取得了这次胜利而笑，同志们在为这位英勇顽强的战士终于苏醒过来而笑。连长一面安慰他，一面自言自语地说：“祖国的后方是破坏不了的，只要有我们，只要有你。”
    的确，此刻，时近午夜，祖国正笼罩着和平的夜的宁静，村庄和山野披着星光，川河在夜幕中奔流，农作物在微风中摇荡，那些终日劳动的农民和换了班的工人正在酣睡，还未懂事的婴孩在母亲的怀抱里慢慢成长！而作家们正在写字台前从事创作，其中有的也许正在写着关于保卫着祖国建设的海防战士的战斗故事吧！准备传给后代，让人们永志不忘。
    不久我们又到了这个连队。在部队作完野战演习之后，战士们开始了文化娱乐活动。在节奏雄壮旋律悠美的手风琴声中，战士们哄然唱了起来：
    我们站在海防前线，
    捍卫着祖国的安全，………多么辽阔美丽的国土啊！我们静听着它在和平中呼吸。………
    这时连长微笑着对我说：“战士们现在更爱祖国了，过去他们打仗走了许多地方，光知道祖国有山川、平野、乡村、城市……现在他们想得多，看得远了，他们知道东北出产铁矿、玉门出产石油、长白山有天然森林；他们谈论祖国像谈论自己的故乡一样……”
    我们来到海边上，这里站着雄威的哨兵，他在警惕地注视波涛汹涌的海面，在他的威武的背影后面，我们伟大的祖国正在飞速地成长壮大。（附图片）
