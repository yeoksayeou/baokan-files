Jiangxi's new grain crop is about to enter the market in large quantities. Many illegal grain merchants are seizing the opportunity to buy "Hehua" rice and prematurely harvested rice seedlings at low prices, defrauding farmers of new grain and seeking exorbitant profits. For example, among the 61 private rice merchants in Nancheng County, 31 had already purchased premature rice seedlings and "Hehua" rice. These rice merchants were buying new grain at prices one-third lower than the state-set prices, and in some cases, even less than half the price. Furthermore, the phenomenon of rice merchants advancing payments for premature rice seedlings was also widespread in various market towns in Ji'an County. This phenomenon is occurring throughout Jiangxi Province, causing significant losses to farmers who are currently short of money. The Jiangxi Daily published a short commentary on this phenomenon, stating that local governments and rural work cadres must publicize the state grain purchase prices to farmers, educate farmers to avoid selling premature rice seedlings and "Hehua" rice as much as possible, and sell at good prices after harvesting. On the other hand, attention should be paid to helping farmers who are indeed facing great difficulties to solve their problems. For example, mobilizing the masses to help each other, carrying out free lending, and making full use of the strength of credit mutual aid groups and credit cooperatives are all good ways to solve difficulties. Local industrial and commercial administrative departments must also educate private merchants through industrial and commercial associations, explaining that buying premature rice seedlings at excessively low prices is a serious illegal profiteering behavior. The commentary further pointed out that purchases of premature rice seedlings and "Hehua" rice should be declared invalid, and the money already paid to farmers should be treated as interest-free loans. However, private merchants should not force repayment, and farmers should repay in full after harvesting. The commentary concluded by stating that in the future, similar destructive production behaviors such as buying premature rice seedlings and "Hehua" rice should be stopped immediately.

Furthermore, it is reported that the state-owned grain department in Doutou Street, Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, has achieved timely purchases, eliminating the phenomenon of private merchants taking the opportunity to depress prices.

Doutou Street is a primary market for grain distribution. Before the new grain even entered the market, the state-owned grain department entrusted the local 12th District Cooperative to purchase on its behalf. Under the leadership of the local administrative authorities, cadres from relevant financial and economic departments such as cooperatives, banks, and tax bureaus were organized to go to various townships to conduct publicity among farmers. After hearing the publicity, the farmers brought their new grain to the grain exchange market for sale. At that time, some private merchants tried to take the opportunity to depress prices, but the farmers immediately said, "You still want to cheat us and make us suffer losses," and refused to sell to them. In addition, the exchange's trading personnel also conducted strict inspections to prohibit all price depression, price gouging, and off-market trading behaviors. Before the purchase, a special meeting was also convened for private merchants to implement the specialized operation of grain by the state. In this way, the new grain brought by the farmers could be sold at the state-set purchase price, eliminating the phenomenon of private merchants taking the opportunity to depress prices.

Farmers are able to sell new grain at good prices, which further enhances their confidence in increasing production. After selling the new grain, they immediately purchase fertilizers and other means of production and consumer goods. The Xu Huogen mutual aid group sold 12 dan of grain and bought 800 jin of bean cake from the cooperative, as well as sickles, groceries, oil, and salt. The 12th District Cooperative prepared 70,000 jin of bean cake, which was soon sold out.

    江西发现不法粮商压低谷价骗购农民新谷
    江西日报号召制止不法商人这种谋取暴利的行为
    江西新谷即将大量上市，不少不法粮商乘机收买禾花谷和放青苗，压低谷价骗购新谷，谋取暴利。如南城县六十一家私营米商中，就有三十一家放了青苗和买了禾花谷。这些米商，用比国营牌价低三分之一的价格收购新谷，有的甚至要低一半以上。又如吉安县各墟镇，也普遍发现米商预放青苗现象。江西全省范围内都发生这种现象，使眼前缺钱的农民蒙受重大损失。江西日报针对这种现象发表短评说：各地政府及农村工作干部必须向农民宣传国家粮食收购牌价，教育农民尽可能不要出卖青苗及禾花谷，在收割后卖好价钱。另一方面，对于确实有很大困难的农民，要注意设法帮助解决其困难。如发动群众自己互助互济，开展自由借贷，以及充分利用信用互助组和信用合作社的力量等，都是解决困难的好办法。各地工商行政部门，也必须通过工商联组织，对私商进行教育，说明以过低价格买青苗等方式骗购农民新谷的行为，是严重的违法暴利行为。短评中又指出：对已买青苗和禾花谷的应宣布无效，已付农民的款项按无利贷款处理。但私商不得强迫索还，待农民收谷后如数清偿。短评最后指出：今后，类似买青苗、禾花谷的破坏生产行为应立即停止。
    又讯：江西省南昌县渡头街国营粮食部门，做到了及时收购，消灭了私商乘机压价现象。
    渡头街是一个粮食集散的初级市场，早在新谷还没有上市之前，国营粮食部门就委托了当地十二区合作社代为收购。又在当地行政领导下，组织了合作社、银行、税务所等有关财经部门干部，分赴各乡向农民进行宣传。农民听到宣传后，都将新谷挑来粮食交易市场出卖。当时还有些私商想乘机压价，农民马上就说：“你还想害我们吃亏。”都不卖给他。另外，交易所的交易人员也进行严格检查，禁止一切压价、抬价、以及场外交易行为。在收购之前，还专门召集了私商开会，实行粮食专行专业的经营。这样，农民挑来的新谷，都能照国营收购的牌价卖出，消灭了私商乘机压价的现象。
    农民新谷价钱卖得好，增产信心更加增强，卖完新谷后马上购买肥料等生产资料及生活资料。徐火根互助组卖了十二担谷，就向合作社买了八百斤枯饼，还买了镰刀和杂货、油、盐等。十二区合作社准备了七万斤枯饼，不久就卖光了。
