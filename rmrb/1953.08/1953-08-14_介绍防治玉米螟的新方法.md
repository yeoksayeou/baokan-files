    Introducing New Methods for Preventing Corn Borers
    Plant Protection Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government

    The corn borer, also known as the corn stalk borer, damages various crops such as corn, sorghum, cotton, and hemp, but corn is the most severely affected. This insect bores into the stems of crops, causing damage to the plant's physiological structure. In severe cases, it can cause the entire plant to wither, die, or even fall over. This insect is distributed in all provinces of China, both north and south. In 1941, the corn borer infestation in Sanyuan and Huaxian counties in Shaanxi Province resulted in a loss of 25 to 65 percent of the corn crop. In North China, the corn borer is a major threat to corn production; this year alone, more than 20,000 mu of corn in the Fengtai and Shijingshan districts of Beijing's suburbs have been affected by this pest.

    In the past, the prevention and control of corn borers emphasized the early crushing or burning of the stems of crops infested with this insect; otherwise, there would be no relatively effective control methods after a long time. This year, Hebei, Shandong, the suburbs of Beijing, and the suburbs of Tianjin have successively created a method of irrigating the heart leaves with "666" and "DDT" to control corn borers. This method is not only effective but also inexpensive. Currently, this method has begun to be promoted in Tongxian, Baoding and other areas.

    The methods currently used in various regions are divided into two types: applying pesticide powder and spraying pesticide solution. To apply pesticide powder, when the corn has not yet extracted the tassels and the top is shaped like a trumpet, use 5/1000th "666" powder packed in a thin cloth bag and pat it on the infested corn stalks along the ridges. It is best to apply the powder in the afternoon so that the powder falls into the trumpet-shaped opening and the dew at night can carry it into the core leaves to kill the insects. One jin of pesticide powder can be used to sprinkle about 1,000 corn plants. The method of spraying pesticide solution is to mix 1/100th "666" pesticide powder with 35 times the amount of water, or 6/100th wettable "666" with 250 times the amount of water, or 25/100th DDT with 250 times the amount of water, and spray it into the trumpet-shaped opening with a sprayer, which is very effective. Every 250 jin of pesticide solution can be sprayed on 3,000 to 4,000 corn plants. This method has been widely used in the suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin. In addition, Wuqing County in Hebei has a method that saves even more pesticides: use a kettle to hold one jin of 6/100th wettable "666" mixed with 400 jin of water and drip the solution into the core of the corn seedlings, averaging only three liang of pesticide per mu, costing 3,000 yuan. The insecticidal effect is very good and does not hinder the growth of corn.

    Currently, the tassels of late corn in some areas have not yet been extracted, which is the period when the trumpet-shaped opening is formed. If corn borer infestations occur in these areas, they can be tested.

    In order to better exert the control effect, the following points should be noted during control: 1. The pesticide powder used in the liquid should first be mixed with a small amount of water to form a paste, and then add a certain amount of water, which can increase the efficacy. 2. Stir frequently when spraying the pesticide, and do not use too much pesticide to avoid pesticide damage. 3. The properties and ingredients of various pesticides are different. Before promotion, farms or technology promotion stations should first conduct small-scale tests to determine the dilution ratio and dosage of different pesticides to avoid low efficacy or pesticide damage.

    介绍防治玉米螟的新方法
    中央人民政府农业部植物保护司
    玉米螟又叫玉米钻心虫，为害玉米、高粱、棉花、大麻等多种作物，但以玉米受害最为严重。这种虫子蛀食作物的茎秆，作物受害后生理组织破坏；严重时，能使全株枯死以至倒折。我国南北各省都有此虫分布。一九四一年，陕西省三原、华县因此虫为害，玉米损失百分之二十五至六十五。华北地区玉米螟是玉米生产上的一个重大威胁，今年仅北京市郊的丰台、石景山两个区就有二万多亩玉米发生了这种虫害。
    对于玉米螟的防治，以往都强调早期轧扁或烧毁发生这种虫子的作物的茎秆，不然，时间久了就没有比较有效的防治办法了。今年河北、山东、北京市郊和天津市郊先后创造了用“六六六”和“滴滴涕”灌心叶的办法防治玉米螟。这个办法不仅效果好，而且费用低。目前这个办法已在通县、保定一带开始推广。
    目前各地所用的方法，分撒药粉和喷灌药液两种。撒药粉是当玉米还没有抽出雄穗，顶端成喇叭口形时，用千分之五的“六六六”粉装在稀布口袋内顺垅在生虫的玉米棵上拍打。撒粉最好在下午进行，药粉落到喇叭口内可让夜间的露水带进芯叶里将虫杀死。一斤药粉约可撒一千棵玉米。喷灌药液的方法是用百分之一的“六六六”药粉对水三十五倍，或百分之六的可湿性“六六六”对水二百五十倍，或百分之二十五滴滴涕对水二百五十倍，用喷雾器喷到喇叭口里，效果很好。每二百五十斤药水，可喷三四千棵玉米。这种方法已在北京和天津市郊区普遍使用。此外河北武清县还有一种用药更省的办法：用水壶盛一斤百分之六的可湿性“六六六”对四百斤水的药液，向玉米苗芯里滴，平均每亩只用药三两，需费三千元。杀虫效果很好，也不妨碍玉米生长。
    目前有些地区的晚玉米雄穗还没有抽出，正是形成喇叭口的时期。这些地区如发生玉米螟虫可以试用。
    为了更好地发挥除治效果，在防治时应注意以下各点：一、液用的药粉应先用少量水调开成糊状，然后再加一定量的水，这样可以增加药效。二、在喷药时要时常搅拌，用药不可过多以免发生药害。三、各种药的性能和成分不同，在推广前，农场或技术推广站应先做好小型试验，决定不同药剂的稀释倍数和用量，以免发生药效低或药害。
