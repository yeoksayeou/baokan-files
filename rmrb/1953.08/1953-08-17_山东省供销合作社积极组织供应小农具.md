Shandong Province Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Actively Organize the Supply of Small Farm Tools

    In the struggle against bureaucracy, against violations of law and discipline, and against coercive orders, supply and marketing cooperatives in Shandong Province have criticized the past erroneous practices of "only paying attention to the supply of new and large-scale farm tools, and rarely paying attention to the on-site production and supply of small farm tools" and the erroneous idea of "being afraid of trouble and earning less money, and neglecting the supply of small farm tools." They strengthened the concept of serving production, emphasized the integration of production and sales with handicrafts and the supply of small farm tools, and recognized that small farm tools will be the main tools for the vast number of farmers to rely on for production not only at present but also for a considerable period of time to come.
    In order to do a good job in the supply of small farm tools, the Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized cooperatives in various regions and counties in January and February this year to investigate the needs of farmers for small farm tools and the local production and sales situation, and sent five working groups to five regions including Changwei to conduct key investigations. Since March, cooperatives at all levels in the province have signed more than 10,000 production and sales contracts for small farm tools with handicraft production cooperatives and private handicraft workshops engaged in iron, wood, rattan, and bamboo. In order to supply raw materials for the production of small farm tools in a timely manner, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also carried out the work of purchasing scrap iron, scrap steel, and wood. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative also purchased more than 9 million catties of bamboo branches and more than 2,000 tons of pig iron from Zhejiang and other places and transported them to various places to meet the needs of producing various small farm tools. Therefore, before the summer harvest and summer hoeing, more than 1 million pieces of small farm tools that were processed and produced were supplied to the farmers, which was warmly supported by the vast number of members and farmers.
    The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has gained the following experiences in the supply of small farm tools in spring and summer:
    First, it is necessary to do a good job in integrating the production and sales of supply and marketing cooperatives with handicrafts. At present, the means of production and means of livelihood needed by the vast number of farmers mainly rely on handicraft products. However, scattered handicraft production often encounters many difficulties in the process of production, transportation, and sales due to lack of funds and low technology, resulting in a situation where it is difficult to continue production in the off-season and the supply of products is insufficient in the peak season. Therefore, it is necessary to combine the production and sales of supply and marketing cooperatives with handicrafts through various methods, on the one hand, to solve various difficulties in the process of production, transportation, and sales of handicrafts, and on the other hand, to solve the problem of supply sources for supply and marketing cooperatives. For example, under the direct assistance of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Changwei Regional Supply and Marketing Cooperative Branch convened a meeting on the integration of production and sales between the supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives in the entire region and eight neighboring counties in May. At the meeting, through discussions and mutual analysis and criticism, the shortcomings in the past work were made clear, so that the supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives realized the importance of integrating production and sales. On this basis, sample exhibitions were implemented, and the supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives signed 63 integration contracts and 13 agreements on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, with a total transaction value of more than 228 million yuan. In this way, not only did it help local handicraft production cooperatives sell their products, but it also enabled the supply and marketing cooperatives to prepare materials before the summer harvest and summer hoeing, ensuring the supply of materials during the summer harvest and summer hoeing, especially the supply of small farm tools.
    Second, before processing and ordering goods, attention should be paid to investigating the purchasing power and actual needs of members and farmers, soliciting opinions from members and farmers on samples, and avoiding the backlog of products due to specifications and quality that do not meet the needs of members and farmers. For example, the Guting Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yutai County, Jining Region, consulted with farmers in advance and asked for their advice, and processed and manufactured according to the quantity and specifications they needed, and timely supplied 3,361 pieces of various small farm tools, which was supported by the farmers. The Shizilu Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Junan County first formulated a small farm tool supply plan according to the actual needs of local farmers, and specifically signed a contract with the handicraft production cooperative. The technical workers first designed the samples and obtained the consent of the farmers and members before carrying out large-scale processing. The result of this is that the members and the masses are satisfied, and the business of the cooperative can also be developed rapidly.
    Third, the methods of supplying small farm tools (the supply of other means of production and livelihood is also the same) can be adopted such as commodity exhibitions, setting up stalls at temple fairs or market days, sending goods to the countryside, and "sending money and goods to the countryside at the same time, purchasing and supplying at the same time," etc., to facilitate members and farmers and expand the supply and marketing business. For example, the Beizhen Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Bin County took advantage of the opportunity of the Pengli Township in the Second District to hold a township people's congress meeting to display some of the small farm tools prepared for the farmers to visit and purchase. After the visit, the representatives put forward many opinions. The cooperative then made a clearance of all the farm tools in the cooperative based on these opinions. The result of the clearance was: the cooperative had a total of 816 farm tools, of which 564 were completely usable, 200 had problems, and 52 were completely unusable. Most of these problematic and unusable farm tools had been stored in the cooperative for a year, and some (such as three-tooth weeding hoes) had been stored for more than four years. However, after repairing these problematic farm tools to make them meet the specifications, they were quickly sold out. Farmers in various counties in the former Huxi Region have the habit of going to markets and fairs to purchase means of production and livelihood. Therefore, grassroots cooperatives used the method of setting up stalls at temple fairs or market days to carry out supply. The Zhangji grassroots cooperative in Yutai County sold a large number of bamboo brooms, wooden mallets, sickle handles, sickles, wooden shovels, and whetstones at a temple fair on May 19, completing more than 90% of the cooperative's means of production supply plan. The Guting Grassroots Cooperative in Yutai County signed 113 binding contracts with mutual aid groups or member groups. Within 20 days, in the form of paying for goods by purchasing local products, they sold out 1,288 brooms, 950 sets of wooden shovels, 1,150 sickles, 310 wooden mallets, 150 whetstones, and 54 pockets. This not only met the needs of members and farmers for the summer harvest and summer hoeing, but also promoted the sale of local agricultural and sideline products of members and farmers. The members and farmers are very satisfied. The above practices not only changed the past management methods of "guarding the store" and "waiting for business," but also the key to closely connecting the cooperative with the members and the masses, expanding business, and improving management.

    山东省供销合作社积极组织供应小农具
    山东省各地供销合作社，在反对官僚主义、反对违法乱纪、反对强迫命令的斗争中，批判了过去“只重视新式的、大型的农具供应，很少注意就地取材、组织小型农具的生产与供应”的错误作法，和“怕麻烦、挣钱少而忽视供应小农具”的错误思想。加强了为生产服务的观点，重视了与手工业的产销结合和小农具的供应，认识到小农具不仅在当前，而且在相当长的时期内，都将是广大农民赖以生产的主要工具。
    为了作好小农具的供应工作，山东省供销合作社在今年一、二月间组织各专区、县合作社调查农民对于小农具的需要和当地产销情况，并派出五个工作组到昌潍等五个专区作重点调查。全省各级合作社从三月份以来共与铁、木、藤竹等手工业生产合作社、私营手工业作坊订立了一万多件小农具产销合同。为了及时供应小农具生产的原料，各地供销合作社还进行了收购废铁废钢和木料的工作。省供销合作社并从浙江等地购进竹枝九百余万斤、生铁二千多吨，运往各地，以满足生产各种小农具的需要。因此，在夏收、夏锄以前，把加工生产的一百多万件小农具供应到农民手里，受到广大社员、农民的热烈拥护。
    省供销合作社在春、夏季小农具的供应工作中，取得如下几点经验：
    第一，必须作好供销合作社与手工业的产销结合工作。现在广大农民所需要的生产资料和生活资料，主要是依靠手工业的产品。而分散的手工业生产，在产、运、销过程中，常因资金缺乏，技术低下而发生许多困难，造成淡季难以继续生产，旺季则产品供应不足的情况。因此，这就须要通过种种办法把供销社与手工业的产销结合起来，一方面解决手工业产、运、销过程中各种困难，一方面解决供销社的货源问题。如昌潍专区供销合作分社在省供销合作社直接帮助下，曾于五月份召开了全专区及邻区八个县的供销合作社与手工业生产社的产销结合会议。会上通过座谈、讨论、相互分析批判了过去工作中的缺点，使供销社与手工业生产社认识到产销结合的重要意义，在这一基础上，实行了样品展览，供销社与手工业生产社在自愿和互利的原则下签订了六十三份结合合同、十三份协议，交易总值达两亿二千八百余万元。这样，不仅帮助当地手工业生产社推销了产品，而且使供销社在夏收、夏锄之前准备了物资，保证了夏收、夏锄期间的物资供应，特别是小农具的供应。
    第二，在加工订货前应注意调查社员、农民的购买力和实际需要，征求社员、农民对样品的意见，避免产品因规格、质量不适合社员、农民需要而造成积压。如济宁专区鱼台县谷亭供销社，由于事先和农民商量并请教了农民，根据他们所需要的数量、规格进行加工制造，及时供应了各种小农具三千三百六十一件，获得农民拥护。莒南县十字路镇供销社首先根据当地农民实际需要制订了小农具供应计划，并与手工业生产社具体签订了合同，先由技术工人设计好样品，征得农民、社员同意后，再进行大批加工。这样做的结果使社员群众满意，合作社业务也能迅速开展。
    第三，供应小农具的方法（其他生产、生活资料的供应也有的如此），可采取商品展览、庙会或集日设摊、下乡送货、“钱货一齐下乡，一面收购，一面供应”等等办法，以便利社员农民并扩大供销业务。如滨县北镇供销合作社，利用二区彭李乡召开乡人民代表会议的机会，把准备供应农民的一部分小农具陈列出来，让代表们参观、选购。参观后，代表们提出了很多意见。该社又根据这些意见，把社内的全部农具作了一次清查。清查的结果是：该社共有农具八百一十六件，其中完全能用的五百六十四件，有毛病的二百件，根本不能用的五十二件。这些有毛病和不能用的农具，多数是在社内已存了一年，个别的（如三头耘锄）已存了四年多。但把这些有毛病的农具经过修理使其合乎规格后，很快就推销出去了。前湖西专区各县农民向有赶集、赶会购买生产和生活资料的习惯，因此，各基层合作社便利用庙会或集日设摊的办法进行供应。鱼台县张集基层社在五月十九日的一个庙会上即售出大批竹扫帚、木?、镰把、镰刀、木锨，完成该社生产资料供应计划的百分之九十以上。鱼台县谷亭基层合作社曾和互助组或社员小组签订了结合合同一一三份，在二十天的时间内，以收购土产付货的方式，即将扫帚一二八八把、木锨九五○套、镰刀一一五○张、木?三一○杆、磨石一五○块、口袋五四条全部卖光。这样既满足了社员、农民夏收、夏锄需要，同时还推销了社员、农民的土副产品。社员、农民都很满意。上述做法，不仅转变了过去那种“死守门市”、“坐等买卖”的经营方法，同时也是密切合作社与社员群众联系、扩大业务、改善经营的关键。    （邢冠五）
