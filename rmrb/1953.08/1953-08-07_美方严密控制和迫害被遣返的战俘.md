Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th. Our correspondent reports: Starting at 9:00 AM on the 5th, the first group of 400 non-Korean and Korean prisoners of war being repatriated after the signing of the armistice agreement were handed over to the other side at Panmunjom.

Among the 150 non-Korean prisoners of war handed over on the 5th, there were 70 Americans, 26 British, 23 Turks, 12 Filipinos, 7 Colombians, and 7 French. In addition, there was one each from Australia, Canada, Belgium, South Africa, and Greece.

All non-Korean sick and wounded prisoners of war underwent physical examinations before they departed. Most of their conditions were very minor.

These repatriated prisoners of war all abhorred the war. One prisoner of war said that he would no longer participate in any war because "I have had enough of this war." He said: This war is "meaningless and barbaric." Many American prisoners of war were excited while waiting for repatriation, but expressed great concern about the fate awaiting them on the Panmunjom side. An American prisoner of war from Arkansas said he feared that "American doctors" would keep him in the "hospital" for too long. He said, "They might put me there for years, for reasons only God knows."

As the trucks and ambulances slowly drove off, the prisoners of war on board waved goodbye to the prisoners of war who did not leave and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel who accompanied them from the Yalu River prisoner of war camp.

In the "United Nations" forces' prisoner of war reception area, grim-faced military police lined up beside the prisoner of war tents, and reporters and arriving repatriates were separated by ropes. European reporters said that they were subject to strict scrutiny when asking questions of the repatriated American and other countries' prisoners of war because this might cause the prisoners of war to reveal that they had received good treatment in the prisoner of war camps in North Korea. After the prisoners of war silently got out of the vehicles, they were immediately sent to the tents. Many prisoners of war brought pockets filled with prizes and souvenirs from the prisoner of war camps. One Filipino was very careful when getting off the car because he had a guitar around his neck and a bag full of items under his arm.

Repatriated South Korean prisoners of war will be subjected to long-term detention. American news agencies reported that all the repatriated South Korean sick and wounded prisoners of war earlier this year are still being held in Seoul and Yeongcheon, and the currently repatriated 8,000 South Korean prisoners of war will also be sent to Geoje Island for "screening."

According to United Press, nine countries in the "United Nations forces" do not allow their repatriated prisoners of war to meet with reporters. United Press said that three of these nine countries—the Netherlands, the Philippines, and South Africa—do not even allow the names of their repatriated prisoners of war to be published.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th. In order to prevent the repatriated American prisoners of war from revealing the lenient treatment of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese sides, so as to slander the Korean and Chinese sides for "mistreating" prisoners of war, the American military authorities have decided to strictly control the repatriated prisoners of war and persecute those prisoners of war who dare to tell the truth.

Before the first batch of American prisoners of war were repatriated, the American news agencies had already revealed that the U.S. side would not allow prisoners of war who might tell the truth to talk to reporters, and even those prisoners of war who were allowed to meet with reporters would be subject to "strict supervision" during the conversation. The situation after the repatriation of prisoners of war on the 5th confirmed this. According to United Press reporter Kendrick, the repatriated prisoners of war were only allowed to talk to reporters after U.S. military officers had "said a few words" to them, and the prisoners of war were warned not to "talk too freely." When prisoners of war talked to reporters, an inspector and a security officer were present, and if he talked "too freely," they would not allow him to speak. Another inspector checked the news written by the reporters before allowing it to be published.

Not only that, the U.S. military authorities are also preparing to further persecute the prisoners of war. Agence France-Presse Washington, 2nd, had already reported: Well-informed American sources said, "The United States will conduct careful ideological checks on the American prisoners of war released in the next few weeks, just like the ideological checks conducted on the sick and wounded prisoners of war released this spring"; "and will pick out those who may be affected by communist propaganda." According to the Associated Press: "A team of about one hundred officials will accompany these returning prisoners on troop carriers in Incheon. These people will collect information from the returning prisoners, and each prisoner must explain his life during his captivity."

It is worth noting that the U.S. side wants to use the so-called "identification" as an excuse to block the list of repatriated prisoners of war. According to United Press: "Only those who have been verified to have no problems during identification will have their names published. If there is any doubt, the names of the repatriated prisoners of war will not be published temporarily." Obviously, the purpose of the U.S. side in taking this measure is to conceal a part of the prisoners of war they are preparing to persecute from the American people, especially the families of the prisoners of war, in order to escape the condemnation and opposition of the American people.

The Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang also announced that all repatriated South Korean prisoners of war will be detained. According to United Press: People on the side of the Li puppet army said that more than 8,000 South Korean prisoners of war who are about to be repatriated will be sent to Geoje Island for "screening." Li puppet army Chief of Staff Bai Shanye (Paik Sun-yup) publicly said on the 5th that the repatriated puppet army prisoners of war "cannot be visited or sent home." He also said that he could not tell everyone how long it would take for these people to return home.

### 美方严密控制和迫害被遣返的战俘

    美方严密控制和迫害被遣返的战俘
    【新华社开城五日电】本社记者报道：从五日上午九时起，停战协定签字后第一批遣返的非朝鲜籍和朝鲜籍战俘四百人在板门店移交给对方。
    五日交给对方的一百五十名非朝鲜籍战俘中有七十名美国人、二十六名英国人、二十三名土耳其人、十二名菲律宾人、七名哥伦比亚人、七名法国人，此外，还有澳大利亚、加拿大、比利时、南非和希腊人各一名。
    所有非朝鲜籍病伤战俘在他们未动身之前，都曾经过体格检查。其中大多数的病状都是很轻微的。
    这些被遣返的战俘都很厌恶战争。有一个战俘说，他将不再参加任何战争，因为“我在这场战争中已经受够了”。他说：这场战争是“毫无意义的和野蛮的”。许多美国战俘在等待遣返时都很兴奋，但对于在板门店那边等待着他们的命运却表示非常忧虑。一位美国阿肯色州的战俘说，他害怕“美国医生”会使他在“医院”住得太久。他说：“他们可能把我放在那里放上好几年，理由只有天知道。”
    当卡车和救护车慢慢开行时，车上的战俘向没有走的战俘和陪同他们从鸭绿江战俘营来到此地的志愿军人员挥手告别。
    在“联合国”军方面的战俘接收区，面色阴沉的宪兵排起队来站在战俘篷帐的旁边，记者和到达的被遣返人员被绳子所隔开。欧洲籍的记者说，他们对被遣返的美国和其他国家的战俘提问题要受到严格的检查，因为这可能使战俘们在回答时说出他们在朝鲜北部战俘营受到良好待遇。当战俘们默默地自车上下来以后，他们就立即被送到篷帐里去了。许多战俘都从战俘营带来了装满奖品和纪念物的口袋。一个菲律宾人在下车时非常小心，因为他的颈上套着一架吉他，臂下挟着装满物品的袋子。
    被遣返的南朝鲜战俘将受到长期的拘留。美国通讯社报道说，今年早些时候所有被遣返的南朝鲜病伤战俘现在仍然被关在汉城和永川，目前正在遣返的八千南朝鲜战俘也将要被送到巨济岛去“审查”。
    据合众社报道，“联合国军”中的九个国家不允许他们的被遣返的战俘接见记者。合众社说，这九个国家中有三个国家——荷兰、菲律宾和南非甚至不许公布它们被遣返的战俘的姓名。
    【新华社六日讯】美国军事当局为了防止被遣返的美国战俘透露朝中方面宽待战俘的情形，以便诬蔑朝中方面“虐待”战俘，已经决定要严密地控制被遣返的战俘，并对其中敢于陈述真实情况的战俘进行迫害。
    在第一批美国战俘遣返之前，美国通讯社就已经透露：美方将不许可能讲真话的战俘和记者谈话，就是那些被准许和记者见面的战俘，在谈话时也要受到“严密监视”。五日战俘遣返后的情况证实了这一点。据合众社记者肯德里克报道：遣返的战俘要在美军军官对他们“谈过几句话”后，才准和记者们谈话，战俘们受到警告，不准“谈得太随便了”。当战俘和记者们谈话时，一个检查员和一个安全军官都在场，假若他谈得“太随便”时，他们就不许他开口。另一个检查员把记者所写的消息加以检查，然后才许发表。
    不但如此，美军当局还准备对战俘作进一步的迫害。法新社华盛顿二日电早就报道：消息灵通的美国人士说，“美国将对今后几个星期释放的美国战俘进行仔细的思想检查，就像对今年春天被释放的病伤战俘所进行的思想检查一样”；“并且要把那些可能受到共产党宣传影响的人挑出来”。据美联社透露：“人数约一百名的一队官员，将陪同这些遣返回来的俘虏在仁川上运兵船。这些人将从回来的俘虏中间收集情报，每个俘虏都得说明他在被俘期间的生活。”
    值得注意的是：美方要以所谓“辨认身份”为借口，封锁被遣返的战俘名单。据合众社说：“只有那些在辨认身份时经过核对证明毫无问题的人，才将他们的姓名发表。假若有任何疑问，被遣返俘虏的姓名就暂时不发表。”显然，美方采取这种措施，其目的是要把他们准备加以迫害的一部分战俘，对美国人民尤其是战俘家属隐瞒起来，以逃避美国人民的谴责和反对。
    李承晚匪帮也宣布要把被遣返的南朝鲜战俘全部扣押起来。据合众社透露：李伪军方面人士说，即将遣返的八千多名南朝鲜战俘将被送往巨济岛进行“审查”。李伪军陆军参谋长白善烨五日公然说：被遣返的伪军战俘“不能够被访问或送回家”。他并说，他无法告诉大家，这些人要多久才能回家。
