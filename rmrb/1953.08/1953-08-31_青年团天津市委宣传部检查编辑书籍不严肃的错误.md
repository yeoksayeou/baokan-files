    The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League Propaganda Department Examines Errors of Careless Book Editing

    Editor's Note: After the "Reader's Letters Summary" column published on July 1st featured a reader's letter criticizing the crude and shoddy nature of certain books published by Tianjin Popular Publishing House, both Tianjin Popular Publishing House and the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League (the editor of the books criticized by the reader) sent letters of self-criticism. The self-criticism from the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League is published below:

    Letter from the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League:
    The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on July 1st published a reader's letter titled "Certain Books of Tianjin Popular Publishing House Exhibit Crude and Shoddy Phenomenon," which cited sixteen books, all of which were edited by us. We have examined our past editing work and are now informing you of the results:

    In the two and a half years from January 1951 to June 1953, we edited a total of thirty-one books, publishing 1,185,500 copies. These books played a certain role in timely cooperation with various political movements, meeting the learning needs of young people, and connecting with and educating the broad masses of young people. However, as pointed out in the letter of criticism, there are more serious shortcomings and errors in our editing work. The content of most of the books we edited was not local material, so there was a serious duplication phenomenon with the publications of central-level publishing houses. We also had a careless phenomenon when excerpting articles by Party leaders and other responsible comrades. The phenomenon of carelessness in editing and proofreading work is also very serious; therefore, individual selected articles are not strong in ideology, and there are many omissions of punctuation marks and typos. In addition, we often omit the original publication date and publications of articles, and sometimes we do not respect the author's copyright enough.

    The reasons for the above shortcomings and errors are: First, before 1952, we did not understand the publication guidelines and policies of local publishing houses; although we heard the transmission of relevant issues such as local publishing tasks in July 1952, we did not seriously study and implement them, and the six books published later still duplicated the publications of central-level publishing houses. Second, we lack a serious, conscientious, and responsible work attitude, and the political, theoretical, and professional level of cadres is not high. Third, the work is unplanned, and no one is regularly responsible for editing work. The Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League did not pay attention to editing work, and often only decided on tasks and assigned editing cadres temporarily in order to rush tasks, so it was difficult to improve the work.

    In order to improve future editing work, in addition to submitting a request to the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party to strengthen leadership and review work, we are also determined to strengthen the overall concept in editing work, implement the work guidelines of local publishing houses, and fully utilize and recommend the publications of central-level publishing houses. If, in order to cooperate with internal League studies, it is necessary to print articles that fall outside the scope of local publishing tasks, we must first ask the Party Committee and relevant departments to avoid the phenomenon of repeated printing. We must strengthen the planning of publishing work and overcome the past phenomenon of grabbing everything at once; we must strictly implement the review system, and the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee of the League must effectively do the initial review work.

### 青年团天津市委宣传部检查编辑书籍不严肃的错误

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    青年团天津市委宣传部检查编辑书籍不严肃的错误
    编者按：七月一日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了读者批评天津通俗出版社某些书籍有粗制滥造现象的来信后，天津通俗出版社和青年团天津市委宣传部（读者所批评书籍的编辑者）都来信作了检讨。现将青年团天津市委宣传部的检讨发表如下：青年团天津市委员会宣传部来信：七月一日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了以“天津通俗出版社的某些书籍有粗制滥造现象”为题的读者来信，其中举出的十六种书籍全部是我们编辑的。我们检查了过去的编辑工作，现在将结果告诉你们：
    一九五一年一月到一九五三年六月的两年半中，我们共编辑了三十一种书籍，出版了一百十八万五千五百册。这些书籍在及时配合历次政治运动、满足青年群众的学习要求以及联系并教育广大青年群众方面都起了一定作用。但是，正如批评信中所指出的，我们编辑工作中有着较严重的缺点和错误。我们所编辑的书籍，内容绝大部分不是本地的题材，因此与中央一级出版社的出版物有严重的重复现象。我们在节录党的领袖与其他负责同志的文章时还有不严肃的现象。在编辑校对工作上粗枝大叶的现象也十分严重；因此，个别选辑的文章思想性不强，标点符号的遗漏和错别字很多。此外，我们还经常略去文章的原载日期和刊物，有时还对作者的版权不够尊重。
    产生以上缺点和错误的原因是：一、在一九五二年以前，我们不了解地方出版社的出版方针和政策；一九五二年七月我们虽然听到了关于地方出版任务等有关问题的传达，但没有认真的学习并加以贯彻，以后出版的六本书籍中仍旧和中央一级出版社的出版物有重复现象。二、我们缺乏严肃、认真、负责的工作态度，同时干部的政治、理论、业务水平不高。三、工作无计划，没有专人经常负责编辑工作。青年团天津市委员会宣传部没有重视编辑工作，往往只是为了赶任务而临时决定任务和委派编辑干部，因此就使工作很难提高。
    为了改进今后编辑工作，除呈请中共天津市委员会宣传部加强领导和审查工作外，我们还决心在编辑工作上加强整体观念，贯彻地方出版社的工作方针，充分运用和推荐中央一级出版社的出版物。如果为了配合团内学习，必须印行涉及地方出版的任务范围以外的文章时，一定事先请示党委和有关部门，以避免重复印行的现象。我们要加强出版工作的计划性，克服过去存在的乱抓一把的现象；要严格执行审稿制度，团市委宣传部要切实做好初审工作。
