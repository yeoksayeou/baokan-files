    TASS Refutes U.S. Denial of Crime of Shooting Down Soviet Airliner
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 2nd] TASS, Moscow, August 2nd: Moscow newspapers on August 2nd published a TASS statement entitled "Regarding the Attack on a Soviet IL-12 Airliner by U.S. Military Aircraft" and a map showing the true route of the Soviet airliner. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    The Soviet government's note to the U.S. government, published yesterday, stated that, according to verified reports from Soviet authorities, on July 27th of this year at 6:28 AM Moscow time, four U.S. fighter planes that intruded into the airspace of the People's Republic of China attacked and shot down a Soviet IL-12 airliner flying on a regular route from Lushunkou to the Soviet Union near Huadian, 110 kilometers from the Sino-Korean border. Fifteen passengers and six crew members died in the downed plane.
    The Soviet government lodged a firm protest with the U.S. government against this piratical attack on a Soviet airliner by U.S. military aircraft.
    Now, it is known that in order to cover up this criminal act by the U.S. military authorities, the U.S. government is attempting to misrepresent this incident as the shooting down of a Soviet IL-12 aircraft by U.S. planes on July 27th in the skies over North Korea, allegedly eight miles from the Yalu River. U.S. newspapers, clearly acting on orders, are even supporting this claim in an attempt to conceal the truth of the crimes committed by U.S. airmen. However, fabricated claims cannot withstand factual rebuttal.
    As can be seen from the now-published map indicating the area where the IL-12 airliner was destroyed, when the IL-12 airliner was making its regular flight on July 27th, it was attacked and shot down by U.S. planes that had intruded into the airspace of the People's Republic of China near Huadian, 110 kilometers from the Sino-Korean border. It is known that the coordinates of Huadian are 42 degrees 58 minutes North latitude and 126 degrees 43 minutes East longitude.
    It has been definitively confirmed that on July 27th, four U.S. F-86 aircraft, including the plane piloted by Ralph S. Parr, the aerial bandit who shot down the Soviet plane, flew over Huadian for a considerable period of time before attacking the Soviet plane. This proves that the U.S. air force personnel's actions were aimed at deliberately intercepting a Soviet transport plane on a route they were familiar with.
    These reliable facts irrefutably prove the crimes committed by the U.S. aerial bandits in the Huadian area.

    塔斯社驳斥美国抵赖击落苏联客机的罪行
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二日电：莫斯科各报二日刊载了塔斯社发表的题为“关于美国军用飞机袭击苏联伊尔十二式客机”的声明和一张标明苏联客机真实航线的地图。声明全文如下：
    苏联政府致美国政府的照会已于昨日发表，里面说，根据苏联主管当局已经核实的报告，今年七月二十七日莫斯科时间六点二十八分，侵入中华人民共和国领空的四架美国战斗机，在距中朝边界一百一十公里处的桦甸附近，袭击并击落了一架正在旅顺口到苏联的正规航线上飞行的苏联伊尔十二式客机。在被击落的飞机上，十五个乘客和六个飞行人员死难。
    苏联政府向美国政府提出了坚决的抗议，抗议美国军用飞机对苏联客机进行的这种强盗式的袭击。
    现在，大家知道，美国政府为了包庇美国军事当局这种犯罪的行为，企图把这次事件硬说成是今年七月二十七日美国飞机在北朝鲜所谓离鸭绿江八英里的上空击落了一架苏联伊尔十二式飞机。美国报纸，显然是奉令办事，竟然支持上面这种说法，企图借此掩盖美国飞行人员所犯罪行的真相。但是，虚构的说法是经不起事实的反驳的。
    从现在发表的指明伊尔十二式客机被击毁的区域的地图可以看出，当伊尔十二式客机在七月二十七日作定期航行的时候，在距中朝边界一百一十公里处的桦甸附近，被侵入中华人民共和国领空的美国飞机袭击并击落了。大家知道，桦甸的方位是北纬四十二度五十八分，东经一百二十六度四十三分。
    已经确定地证实，七月二十七日，四架美国F—86飞机，包括把苏联飞机击落的空中强盗拉尔夫·斯·巴尔所驾驶的飞机在内，在袭击苏联飞机以前，在桦甸上空飞行了相当长的时间。这证明美国空军人员的行动目的是在他们熟知的航路上故意截击苏联运输机。
    这些可靠的事实无可辩驳地证明了美国空中强盗在桦甸地区所犯的罪行。
