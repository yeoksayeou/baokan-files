Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 23rd: Since the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives, as members of the Joint Red Cross Team South Group, entered the United Nations Command area, the United Nations Command has used various means, including violent threats, to unreasonably restrict and obstruct their work. The Korean-Chinese side has lodged serious protests at the Joint Red Cross Team Coordination Group and the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee against this behavior of the United Nations Command in violation of the Armistice Agreement and the Joint Red Cross Team working agreement. However, the United Nations Command not only failed to correct it immediately, but also flatly denied it, attempting to deny the facts. The Korean-Chinese side, therefore, raised accusations on the above-mentioned violations of the Armistice Agreement at the Military Armistice Commission on August 20th, believing that the Military Armistice Commission should handle this responsibly, so that the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives can provide humanitarian services to prisoners of war in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement and the Joint Red Cross Team working agreement.

On August 23rd, the Military Armistice Commission has sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, requesting to dispatch three mobile neutral nations inspection teams to the United Nations Command prisoner of war camps and prisoner of war transfer stations on Geoje Island, Yeongdeungpo, and the Imjin River Bridge to investigate the facts listed in the above-mentioned protests and accusations by the Korean-Chinese side, and report the investigation results to the Military Armistice Commission for handling.

    军事停战委员会邀请中立国监察委员会
    调查美方阻挠我红十字会代表活动的事实
    【新华社开城二十三日电】自朝中红十字会代表作为联合红十字会小组南组的成员，进入联合国军方面地区以后，联合国军方面即以种种手段，包括暴力的威胁在内，对他们的工作加以无理的限制与阻挠。朝中方面曾在联合红十字会小组协调组及战俘遣返委员会上严重抗议联合国军方面此种违反停战协定与联合红十字会小组工作协议的行为，但联合国军方面非但不立即予以纠正，反而矢口抵赖，妄图否认事实。朝中方面乃于八月二十日的军事停战委员会上，就上述违反停战协定事件提出指控，认为军事停战委员会应对此作负责处理，俾使朝中红十字会代表得以按照停战协定与联合红十字会小组工作协议的规定，向战俘提供人道主义服务。
    八月二十三日，军事停战委员会已致函中立国监察委员会，请求派遣三个机动中立国视察小组，分赴巨济岛、永登浦及临津江桥联合国军战俘营及战俘转运站，就朝中方面上述历次抗议与指控中所例举的事实，进行调查，并将调查结果报告军事停战委员会处理。
