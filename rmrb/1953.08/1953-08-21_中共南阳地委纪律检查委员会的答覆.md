    Reader's Letters Summary

    Reply from the Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Nanyang Prefectural Committee
    The Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Nanyang Prefectural Committee wrote: Reader Duan Fucai and others reported the illegal activities of Zhang Yunsong, Secretary of the Nanhedian District Committee of Nanzhao County. We organized a special team to conduct an investigation in the area, and the investigation proved that the reported material was completely true.
    Zhang Yunsong's support and tolerance of Fu Qingxia's reckless squandering has indeed caused extremely negative political impact. According to the investigation, from August of last year to March of this year, in eight months, Fu Qingxia consumed a total of 309 doses of medicine. Adding in food and other expenses, the total expenditure, according to incomplete statistics, amounted to approximately 14 million. When Zhang Yunsong and others submitted these expenses for reimbursement, the county approved them without principle. According to doctors' examinations, Fu Qingxia's original condition was not serious, and by the end of last year, she was no longer ill. More seriously, Zhang Yunsong regarded the doctor treating Fu Qingxia as his private property, forbidding the masses from consulting the doctor, which further aroused public dissatisfaction. In order to "take care" of Fu Qingxia, Zhang Yunsong often neglected his work. When the county launched a democratic movement in the countryside last December, the county party committee asked Zhang Yunsong to report the situation over the phone. Because Zhang Yunsong had done no work at all, he asked the person answering the phone to falsely claim that he was not at home. Due to Zhang Yunsong's extremely irresponsible work, many problems arose in the district's work.
    Zhang Yunsong lost the qualities of a communist party member and even engaged in feudal exploitation of the peasants. In August 1951, he lent 6.13 taels of raw silk to the farmer Shi Wenliang, charging 2 taels of interest per tael per month. In just two months, Shi Wenliang was forced to return 8.5 taels of principal and interest. After the county party committee discovered this matter, it ordered Zhang Yunsong to examine and correct this error. Zhang Yunsong instead forced Shi Wenliang to pay him an additional 55,000 yuan. The county party committee ordered Zhang Yunsong to return the interest to the peasant, but Zhang Yunsong has not yet returned it.
    In addition, Zhang Yunsong has committed serious violations of law and discipline during his tenure, such as suppressing criticism and forcing arranged marriages. The situation is more serious than the material reported by the readers. Based on the results of the investigation, we conducted research and reported to the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Henan Provincial Party Committee for approval. We decided to expel Zhang Yunsong from the party and recommended that the Communist Youth League expel Fu Qingxia from the league. Other relevant personnel have made self-criticisms, so no punishment will be given.

### 中共南阳地委纪律检查委员会的答覆

专栏：读者来信摘要

    中共南阳地委纪律检查委员会的答覆
    中共南阳地委纪律检查委员会来信：读者段复财等检举南召县南河店区区委书记张云松的违法行为，经我们组织专人到当地进行检查，证明检举材料完全属实。
    张云松支持和纵容符青霞肆意挥霍，确已造成极端不良的政治影响。经调查，从去年八月到今年三月八个月中，符青霞共吃药三百零九剂，加上伙食等其它费用，据不完全的统计，耗费总数在一千四百万左右。这些用费，张云松等向上级报销时，县里也就无原则地核准了。而据医生检查，符青霞原来病情并不严重，到去年年底已没有什么病了。更严重的是，张云松把给符青霞治病的医生看成私有，不准群众接医生治病，因此更引起群众不满。张云松为了“照顾”符青霞，经常不做工作。去年十二月全县农村进行民主运动时，县委要张云松在电话上汇报情况，张云松因为根本没有工作，就让接电话的人假说他不在家。由于张云松工作极不负责，该区工作中发生了不少问题。
    张云松丧失了共产党员的品质，还对农民进行封建剥削。在一九五一年八月他将六斤十三两山丝借给农民石文亮，每月每斤要二两利息；只两月时间，石文亮即被迫交还本息八斤五两。县委发觉这件事后，就责令张云松检查和纠正这个错误，张云松竟反而逼迫石文亮再补给他五万五千元钱。县委责令张云松把利息退给农民，张云松到现在还没有退还。
    此外，张云松在任职期间有压制批评以及强迫包办婚姻等严重违法乱纪的事实。情况比读者所检举的材料更为严重。我们根据检查结果进行研究，并报请河南省委纪律检查委员会批准，决定开除张云松党籍，建议团委开除符青霞团籍；其他有关人员已作了检讨，故不予处分。
