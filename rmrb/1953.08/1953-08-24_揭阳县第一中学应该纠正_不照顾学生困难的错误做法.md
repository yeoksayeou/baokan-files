    Jieyang County No. 1 Middle School Should Correct
    Erroneous Practices That Do Not Take Into Account Students' Difficulties
    A letter from Zhang Weiwo, a student at Jieyang County No. 1 Middle School in Guangdong: The administrative leaders of our school are too unconcerned about the diet of students staying at school during the summer vacation. Our school started the summer vacation on July 16th, and many students requested the school to solve the problem of summer meals before the end of the semester. However, the school's administrative cadres showed no concern for the students' lives and health, and on the 14th, they announced a set of "dietary regulations," stipulating that students' summer meals would be divided into two periods: the first period from July 16th to 31st, and the second period from August 1st. Students who wanted to join the mess were required to register before July 15th and pay the full amount of the meal fee for the entire period. Late registrations or those not staying for a full period were not allowed to register for meals, and students who joined the mess were not allowed to stop or withdraw from the mess in the middle of the period. The school's stipulated registration time happened to be the time when students were busy studying and taking exams, and many students did not have money in hand at the end of the semester, and some students even planned to go home first. Therefore, very few students registered before the 15th. The school then refused to allow students to eat, and many students had to buy food in restaurants or cook porridge themselves.
    I am a graduating high school student of this class and plan to stay at school to review my lessons. Because I didn't have money in hand before the 15th, I didn't register, and I didn't have breakfast on the 16th. At that time, my roommate and I put together the meal fees for five days for eight people and asked Mr. Wang Jianguang of the General Affairs Office to pay a portion of the meal fees first and start eating lunch that day. We were rejected the first time we went. The second time we went, we gave many reasons, and the General Affairs Office reluctantly agreed to let us eat from the 17th, but limited us to paying the full amount of the meal fees before the 21st. Unexpectedly, at more than 4:00 p.m. that day, Lin Zhitian, the director of the General Affairs Office, said that we were "disrupting the system" and returned our meal fees for five days and the full meal fee of Wang Chaozhu, a high school student who graduated early (late registration). We went to talk to Lin Zhitian and Lin Yi'e, the deputy director of the Academic Affairs Office, but they both refused to accept our opinions. Finally, we found the principal to talk about this issue, and the school allowed students in our high school graduating class to pay and join the mess, but students of other grades were still rejected from joining the mess for "violating the system."
    I believe that the school's administrative practice of not taking into account students' difficulties is wrong, and I hope they will seriously examine and correct it.

### 揭阳县第一中学应该纠正  不照顾学生困难的错误做法

    揭阳县第一中学应该纠正
    不照顾学生困难的错误做法
    广东揭阳县第一中学学生张纬鏺来信：我校行政领导方面对暑期留校学生的膳食问题太不关心。我校在七月十六日开始放暑假，许多同学在学期结束前都向学校提出要求解决暑期膳食问题。但是学校行政干部却毫不关心同学的生活和健康，在十四日公布了一套“膳食制度”，规定学生暑期膳食分二期：第一期自七月十六日起至三十一日，第二期自八月一日起。要入伙的同学限于七月十五日以前登记并交清全期膳费，逾期或入伙时间不满一期的不准登记用膳，入伙同学中途不得停膳退膳。校方规定的登记时间恰好是同学们学习和考试的紧张时候，而且不少同学在学期结束时手里都没有钱，有的同学还准备先回家一次，因此十五日前登记的同学很少。学校方面竟就不准同学用膳，很多同学只得到饭馆买东西吃或自己煮粥吃。
    我是本届高中毕业学生，准备留校温课；因为十五日前手头没钱，没去登记，十六日就没有吃上早餐。当时我和同宿的同学凑够了八个人五天的膳费，向总务处王剑光先生要求先缴一部分膳费，当天中午起用膳。第一次我们去时被拒绝了，第二次我们又去说了许多理由，总务处才勉强答应让我们从十七日起用膳，但限我们在二十一日前交清全期膳费。不料当天下午四点多钟，总务主任林志天说我们“破坏制度”，把我们五天的膳费和高中提前毕业同学汪潮柱（逾期登记）的全期膳费都退回来了。我们找林志天和教导处副主任林一鹗去谈，他们都拒绝接受我们的意见。最后，我们找到校长谈这个问题，校方才准许我们高中毕业班的同学缴款入伙；但其他各级同学仍因“违反制度”而被拒绝入伙。
    我认为学校行政方面这种不照顾同学困难的做法是错误的，希望他们认真检查并纠正。
