    World Peace Council President Joliot-Curie issued a statement on the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The full text is as follows:
    The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement has been warmly welcomed by people of all countries, because it is a great victory for peace, a victory won by the Korean people themselves at the cost of great sacrifice and suffering, and also a victory for the hundreds of millions of men and women in all countries who are demanding an end to this war with increasing strength. The signing of the armistice agreement was realized after the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna put forward the demand for an immediate ceasefire. This event of great significance confirms the correctness and timeliness of the call issued by the World Peace Council. This call affirmed that negotiation and agreement are possible.
    Despite all the difficulties and obstructions encountered in signing the armistice agreement, it has finally been signed. This proves even more clearly that it is possible to resolve other current conflicts or disputes through negotiation and agreement.
    Therefore, this initial achievement is a powerful encouragement to the World Peace Council's movement calling for the settlement of disputes through negotiation. There is no doubt that world public opinion will now exert pressure with even greater force, demanding a peaceful resolution of all other issues, such as ending the war in Vietnam.
    However, we should point out that stubborn forces that oppose the peaceful resolution of disputes still exist. In the Korean issue, new attempts may occur to undermine the already reached agreement, or actions may occur that prevent the conclusion of new agreements to ensure a just peace in the region. Therefore, our most important task is to continue our efforts everywhere to quickly facilitate negotiations, so that the conspiracies of those who attempt to delay or obstruct the reaching of agreements will be defeated. This is the meaning of the movement launched in accordance with the call of the World Peace Council.
    This movement to resolve disputes through negotiation is currently unfolding in various ways in the major countries of the world. This movement has not only led peace movement organizations in various countries to take various actions, but has also led various organizations and associations that support this approach or act according to it to take various actions.
    The upcoming meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council will study the initial achievements we have obtained. I believe that the Standing Committee will draw lessons from this meeting that will enable all those who advocate resolving disputes through negotiation to act towards the same goal of peace today. The purpose of this movement is to achieve a true relaxation of international tensions. The Korean armistice and the recognition by certain governments of the possibility of holding a summit meeting of the major powers have already proven to us that the people of all countries can achieve the goal of truly easing international tensions today.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 1st. The Secretariat of the World Peace Council sent letters to the Korean National Committee for the Promotion of Peace and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace on the 30th, signed by World Peace Council Secretary-General Jean Laffitte and Secretary Li Yimang.
    The letter from the Secretariat of the World Peace Council stated: "We welcome the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement with great joy and excitement. This is a great victory for the peace-loving people of China and Korea, as well as for all the people around the world who hope for peace. This victory was achieved with the active support of all international peace forces, and after the Korean people suffered greatly and waged a heroic struggle."
    The letter continued: "This victory shows how great the possibility of easing world tensions is, and that even the most serious international differences can be resolved peacefully."
    The letter pointed out that the realization of the Korean armistice is the first great victory in the worldwide struggle for peace and international cooperation. The letter said: "However, the struggle is not over. Now we must continue to work for the strict implementation of the armistice agreement, and for the just and reasonable resolution of the Korean issue, all Asian issues, and all the differences that cause current international tensions."
    The letter also said: "Great hope has been generated in the hearts of the people of all countries, and this hope has been strengthened by your struggle and the heroism you have shown in the face of suffering. Now there is even more reason to turn the hopes of the people of all countries into determination, to strive to ease international tensions through consultation, and to finally achieve peaceful coexistence."
    The letter wished the Korean people an early revival of their motherland and the reconstruction of a peaceful life.
    The letter concluded by saying that consultation will defeat all those who resort to force and violence, and that we will advance together with all the Chinese and Korean people.

    世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里
    就朝鲜停战协定签订发表声明
    【新华社布拉格一日电】世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里就朝鲜停战协定签订发表声明。全文如下：
    朝鲜停战协定的签字，受到世界各国人民的热烈欢迎，因为这是和平的伟大胜利，这是朝鲜人民本身以巨大的牺牲和痛苦为代价而换来的胜利，同时也是一切国家中以日益增长的力量要求结束这一战争的亿万男女的胜利。停战协定的签字是在维也纳世界人民和平大会提出立即停火的要求以后实现的。这一个具有重大意义的事件，证实了世界和平理事会发出的号召的正确和适时。这个号召肯定说：进行谈判和达成协议是可能的。
    尽管停战协定的签订历尽种种困难，尽管为了使协定签字遭遇过种种阻挠，但停战协定终于签订了。这就更明确地证明，以谈判和协议的方式解决当前其他的冲突或争端是可能的。
    因此，这个初步成就对世界和平理事会号召以谈判方式解决争端的运动是一个有力的鼓舞。毫无疑问，世界舆论现在将以更加强大的力量施展压力，要求和平解决其他一切问题，例如结束越南战争的问题。
    然而，我们应该指出：反对用和平方式解决争端的顽固力量仍然存在。在朝鲜问题上，还可能发生破坏已经达成的协定的新的企图，或者可能发生阻止缔结新的协定以保证该地区的公正和平的行动。因此，我们最重要的任务就是在各地继续努力，迅速促成谈判，以便使那些企图拖延或阻挠谈判达成协议的阴谋归于失败。这就是根据世界和平理事会的号召而发动的运动的意义。
    这个以谈判方式解决争端的运动，目前正以各种方式在世界上的主要国家中展开。这个运动不仅使各国的和平运动组织采取了各种行动，而且也使赞成这一方针或根据这种方针而活动的各种组织和协会采取了各种行动。
    最近即将召开的世界和平理事会常务委员会将研究我们已获得的初步成就。我认为：常务委员会将从这次会议中得出教训，这些教训将使今天一切拥护以谈判方式解决争端的人们朝着同一的和平目标行动。这一运动的目的是要使世界的紧张局势达到真正的缓和。朝鲜停战和某些政府承认举行最高级的大国会议的可能性已经向我们证明：各国人民在今天是可以达到使国际紧张局势真正缓和的目标的。
    【新华社布拉格一日电】世界和平理事会书记处三十日分别写信给朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会，信件是由世界和平理事会总书记让·拉斐德和书记李一氓签署的。
    世界和平理事会书记处的信件说：“我们以十分高兴和激动的心情欢迎朝鲜停战协定的签字，这是爱好和平的中朝人民以及全世界希望和平的人民的伟大胜利。这个胜利是在国际所有和平力量的积极支持下，在朝鲜人民遭受了极大的痛苦并进行了英勇的斗争后取得的。”
    信件接着说：“这个胜利说明：缓和世界紧张局势的可能性是多么大，说明甚至是最严重的国际分歧也是可以用和平方式来解决的。”
    信件指出，朝鲜停战实现是争取和平与国际合作的世界规模的斗争的第一个伟大的胜利。信中说：“但是，斗争并没有结束。现在我们必须继续努力，争取停战协定严格履行，并争取公正合理地解决朝鲜问题、所有的亚洲问题以及造成目前国际紧张局势的所有分歧。”
    信件又说：“各国人民心中产生了很大的希望，这个希望已因你们的斗争和你们在苦难面前所表现的英勇而加强了。现在有更多的理由应该把各国人民的希望变成决心，争取以协商的方式缓和国际的紧张局势，并最后实现和平共处。”
    信件预祝朝鲜人民早日复兴祖国，重建和平的生活。
    信件最后说，协商将战胜所有诉诸武力和暴力的人，我们将与所有中国人民和朝鲜人民一同前进。
