Agents for Preventing and Controlling Rice Blast
    Ma Runzhi

Rice blast has occurred in various regions, and is quite serious in some individual areas. For example, in the Northeast region, rice blast has been found in areas such as Andong (Liaodong), Hailin (Songjiang), Helong (Jilin), and Lishu (Liaoxi). In Lishu County, the disease is so severe that 60 mu of paddy fields are beyond salvage. In the suburbs of Tianjin, over 70% of the 300,000+ mu of paddy fields are affected by this disease. The leaves of individual severely affected rice plants have already withered. In order to prevent the spread of this disease, spraying agents is one of the effective measures currently. The agent commonly sprayed in various regions is mainly "Bordeaux mixture", but many areas have not been able to properly grasp the proportions of "Bordeaux mixture" and the addition of adhesives, resulting in very low effectiveness, and even causing phytotoxicity.

Generally speaking, rice should be sprayed with "Bordeaux mixture" during the seedling stage, tillering stage, booting stage, and heading stage, but not during the flowering stage. The number of sprays can be increased or decreased (by one time) based on the specific conditions of each region, estimating or predicting the possible degree of disease occurrence. The effectiveness of "Bordeaux mixture" generally lasts for ten to fourteen days. Agent proportions: (1) For application during the seedling and tillering stages: 1 jin of copper sulfate (blue vitriol), 2 to 3 jin of quicklime, 150 to 200 jin of water, and an appropriate amount of adhesive. (2) For application during the booting and heading stages: 1 jin of copper sulfate (blue vitriol), 3 jin of quicklime, 200 jin of water, and an appropriate amount of adhesive.

Adhesives such as soybean flour or soybean milk can be used. When using soybean flour as an adhesive, use 3 to 5 liang of soybean flour per 100 jin of "Bordeaux mixture" (1 jin = 16 liang). You can first put the soybean flour in a small cloth bag, put the bag into the liquid, and slowly knead the bag by hand to squeeze it clean. After squeezing, use a stick to stir the liquid and adhesive evenly. When using soybean milk as an adhesive, use 10 to 14 liang of soybean milk per 100 jin of "Bordeaux mixture" and mix it directly into the "Bordeaux mixture".

According to some recent research reports, spraying with Ceresan lime powder is very effective in preventing and controlling rice blast. Spraying with this agent not only avoids phytotoxicity and reduces runoff, but also has an indirect preventive effect. The proportion is 1 jin of Ceresan mixed with 5 jin of slaked lime to form a powder. Dosage: Each mu requires about 5 jin of the agent per spray. The price of this powder is about the same as "Bordeaux mixture". Therefore, agricultural research institutions, farms, technical guidance stations, and pest and disease control stations in rice-growing areas with the necessary conditions can seize the opportunity to first conduct experiments, study its proportions, fillers, and application methods, so as to gradually promote this method.

    防治稻热病的药剂
    马润芝
    稻热病已在各地发生，个别地区还相当严重。如东北区发现稻热病的地区有安东（辽东）、海林（松江）、和龙（吉林）和梨树（辽西）等地。梨树县因这种病害为害严重已有六十亩稻田无法挽救。天津市郊全郊区的三十多万亩稻田，已有百分之七十发生这种病害。个别被害严重的稻株的叶部已经枯萎。为防止这种病害的蔓延，喷洒药剂是当前的有效措施之一。各地通常喷洒的药剂，主要是“波尔多液”，但不少地区对“波尔多液”的配合量和粘着剂的加用方面不能很好掌握，以致收效很低，甚至发生药害。
    一般说来，水稻在苗期、分蘖期、孕穗期和齐穗期都应喷洒“波尔多液”，惟扬花期不应喷洒。喷洒的次数，可以根据各地具体情况，估计或预测发病的可能程度而增减（一次）。“波尔多液”的药效大致能保持十天到十四天。药剂配合量：（一）在苗期和分蘖期施用的：硫酸铜（蓝矾）一斤、生石灰二至三斤、水一五○至二○○斤、粘着剂适量。（二）在孕穗期和齐穗期施用的：硫酸铜（蓝矾）一斤、生石灰三斤、水二○○斤、粘着剂适量。
    粘着剂可用大豆粉或豆浆。用大豆粉作粘着剂时，每百斤“波尔多液”用大豆粉三到五两（每斤以十六两计），可先将大豆粉装在小布袋里，连袋放入药液内，以手慢慢揉挤布袋，挤净之后，用棍棒把药液和粘着剂搅匀。用豆浆作粘着剂时，每百斤“波尔多液”用豆浆十到十四两，直接混入“波尔多液”里。
    根据最近的一些研究报告，用赛力散石灰粉剂喷撒防治稻热病的效果很好。用这种药剂喷撒不但没有药害，不易流失，并有间接预防作用。配合量为赛力散一市斤和消石灰五市斤混合成粉剂。用量：每市亩喷射一次约需该剂五市斤。这种粉剂和
    “波尔多液”的价格差不多。因此各稻区有条件的农业研究机关、农场、技术指导站和病虫防治站等可以抓紧时机，先进行试验，研究它的配合量、填充剂和使用方法，以便把这个方法逐步推广。
