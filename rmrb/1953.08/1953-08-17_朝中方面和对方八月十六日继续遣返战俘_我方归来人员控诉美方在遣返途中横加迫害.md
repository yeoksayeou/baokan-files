Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th – On the 16th, our side repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war and 251 Korean prisoners of war to the other side, including 12 wounded and sick personnel, totaling 401. Among the non-Korean prisoners of war, there were 75 American prisoners of war and 75 British prisoners of war.

The other side repatriated 2,395 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side, among whom over 200 were beaten and injured by U.S.-Syngman Rhee special agents during repatriation.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th – On August 15th – the 8th anniversary of Korea's liberation – the repatriated personnel from our side excitedly sang "General Kim Il-sung's Song" and "Ode to Stalin" all the way, shouting slogans such as "Long Live General Kim Il-sung" and "Long Live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," returning to the embrace of the motherland. When the repatriation vehicles approached our side's handover zone, a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army on one of the cars jumped to the top of the car's driver's cab, holding aloft a blood-stained flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Last August 15th, this flag had flown over the prisoner-of-war camp on Pongam Island, operated by the U.S. side. In that prisoner-of-war camp, captured soldiers of the Korean People's Army were shot dead by the U.S. side with machine guns (six dead and more than twenty injured) for raising this flag to celebrate the anniversary of the motherland's liberation.

The U.S. side notified our side on the 14th that the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army repatriated on the 15th were all in good health, but among the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army repatriated on the 15th, many were beaten and injured. This was because on the morning of August 14th, while they were traveling from Incheon to Munsan on open-top trains, many U.S.-Syngman Rhee special agents ambushed on both sides of the railway threw stones at them, injuring them. These special agents cruelly threw pre-prepared sharp stones at our captured personnel crowded in the open-top carriages who could not avoid them, and 268 of our captured personnel were injured on the spot. The head of repatriated captured soldier of the Korean People's Army, Li In-che, was broken, and his bone was exposed. T'ak Han-gil's right foot was smashed by a stone. Li In-che's left eye was bleeding after being hit. They complained to the Joint Red Cross team about the U.S. side's cruel persecution of prisoners of war.

Another captured soldier of the Korean People's Army named Park Pung-hae had both his eyes blinded by poisonous gas the day before his repatriation (August 14th) in the Munsan camp. After arriving at our receiving area, he took out seven poison gas grenade shells as evidence and complained to the Joint Red Cross team about the U.S. side's persecution of prisoners of war. At 4:00 p.m. that day, the U.S. military, on the pretext that they were singing, threw more than 70 poison gas grenades at them, and more than 50 of our captured personnel fainted from poisoning on the spot, and some people's eyes were blinded.

    朝中方面和对方八月十六日继续遣返战俘
    我方归来人员控诉美方在遣返途中横加迫害
    【新华社开城十六日电】十六日，我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百五十名，朝鲜籍战俘二百五十一名，其中包括伤病人员十二名。共四百零一名。在非朝鲜籍战俘中有美国籍战俘七十五名，英国籍战俘七十五名。
    对方遣送给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员二千三百九十五名，其中有二百多名在遣返途中被美李特务分子打伤。
    【新华社开城十六日电】八月十五日——朝鲜解放八周年纪念日，遣返归来的我方被俘人员一路上激动地高唱着“金日成将军之歌”和“斯大林颂”，高呼着“金日成将军万岁”、“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁”等口号，回到了祖国的怀抱。当遣送车辆接近我方交接区时，一辆汽车上的一个朝鲜人民军被俘人员跳到汽车驾驶台的顶上，高擎起一面染满血迹的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗。去年八月十五日，这面国旗曾飘扬在美方蜂岩岛战俘营的上空。这个战俘营的朝鲜人民军被俘人员为了升起这面旗帜，庆祝祖国解放纪念日，被美方用机枪打死六名，打伤二十多名。
    美方十四日通知我方说，十五日遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员都是身体健康的，但在十五日被遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员中，却有许多被打伤了。这是在八月十四日上午，他们乘坐敞篷火车从仁川赴汶山途中，被预伏在铁路两侧的许多美李特务用石块打伤的。这些特务残酷地用事先准备好的尖石块掷击拥挤在敞篷车厢里而无法躲避的我方被俘人员，当场有二百六十八名我方被俘人员被打伤。遣返归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员李仁车的头部被打破了，骨头也露了出来。柝汉吉的右脚被石块砸烂了。李仁车的左眼被打得流出血来。他们向联合红十字会小组人员控诉了美方这一残酷迫害战俘的罪行。
    另一个名叫朴风海的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，他的一双眼睛在遣返归来的前一天（八月十四日）在汶山营场内被毒气熏瞎了。他到达我方接收区以后，就拿出七个毒气弹的弹壳作为证据，向联合红十字会小组人员控诉美方这一迫害战俘的罪行。当天下午四时，美军藉口他们唱歌，向他们投掷了七十多颗毒气弹，当场有五十多名我方被俘人员中毒昏倒，有些人的眼睛被熏瞎。
