    Wuwei Special District's Cooperatives at All Levels
    Supply Farm Tools According to Members' Needs
    The cooperatives at all levels in Wuwei Special District, Gansu Province, are doing a good job in supplying farm tools according to the different needs of their members.
    At the beginning of this year, the cooperatives at all levels in Wuwei Special District investigated the styles of farm tools in various places and found that the usage habits differed from county to county, district to district, and township to township. The styles of farm tools had four differences: size, weight, width, and point (sharpness or roundness). Based on these situations, it was decided that the supply of farm tools must be based on local usage habits, purchasing raw materials (scrap iron, copper, broken farm tools, etc.) locally, and supplying them locally. Local blacksmiths and carpenters were also absorbed into production groups in both fixed and mobile forms. Because production was carried out according to the needs of the members, the products had a market. The Yonganbao Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yongchang County, for the first time, had 250 iron shovels, 15 plows, and 86 other farm tools processed by the county cooperative, and they were all sold out in less than seven days.
    By the end of May, according to incomplete statistics from five counties (Zhangye, Minle, Yongchang, Shandan, and Wuwei), a total of 57,142 various farm tools were supplied, solving the difficulties in agricultural production for the farmers and winning the welcome of the members. At present, the processing plants attached to the cooperatives are working hard to rush-produce farm tools for harvesting autumn crops.

    武威专区各级合作社
    根据社员需要供应农具
    甘肃省武威专区各级合作社，根据社员群众的不同要求，做好农具供应工作。
    今年一开始，武威专区各级合作社曾调查了各地农具的样式，发现县与县、区与区、乡与乡的使用习惯不一样，农具式样有四不同——大小、轻重、宽窄、尖圆都有差别。根据这些情况，就决定供应农具必须按照各地使用习惯，就地收购原料（废铁、铜、破烂农具等），就地供应。并吸收当地铁匠和木匠分固定和流动两种形式组织生产小组。由于根据社员的需要进行生产，产品有了销路。永昌县永安堡供销合作社，头一次由县社加工的二百五十张铁锨、十五张铧和其他农具八十六件，不到七天就全卖光了。
    到五月底止，据五个县（张掖、民乐、永昌、山丹、武威）不完全的统计：供应了各种农具共五万七千一百四十二件，解决了农民生产上的困难，受到社员群众的欢迎。现在，各社附设的加工厂等正在紧张地赶制收割秋季作物使用的农具。
