    The General Office of the Central Textile Industry Ministry Conducts Self-Criticism for Randomly Copying Documents
    A letter from the General Office of the Central Textile Industry Ministry states: The criticism made by Comrade Liu Xijiu in the "Abstracts of Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on July 18 regarding our ministry's random copying of documents is completely correct.
    On May 15th of this year, our ministry received a report from the Central-South China Textile Fiber Inspection Institute, stating that the task of replicating cotton grade standards this year was significant. The Central-South China Cotton Grade Standard Replication Committee, jointly organized by relevant agencies in the Central-South region, required a large workspace and requested that our ministry issue a document to the Central-South China Financial and Economic Committee to allocate housing. Financial and economic agencies in the Central-South region should generally contact the Central-South China Financial and Economic Committee and local housing management agencies directly for office space. Upon receiving the report from the Central-South China Textile Fiber Inspection Institute, we should have directly replied in this manner. However, we did not do so. Instead, we agreed to their request to directly ask the Central-South China Financial and Economic Committee to find a solution. At the same time, we believed that the Central-South China Financial and Economic Committee was under the direct leadership of the Central Financial and Economic Committee, and that the Central-South China Cotton Grade Standard Replication Committee included units such as the Central-South China Cooperative Administration and the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation. Without considering whether it was necessary, we casually copied this official document to the leading agencies of these units – the Central Financial and Economic Committee, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, and the Ministry of Commerce. This draft went through layers of review and signing, but no one noticed that copying the document in this way was inappropriate.
    The serious bureaucratic style of writing and officialdom that exists in our daily handling of official documents has already been exposed and criticized in the anti-bureaucracy struggle. Comrade Liu Xijiu's criticism has further heightened our attention to this issue. We are determined to further correct the bureaucratic tendencies in handling official documents and have already notified the drafting and reviewing personnel of all departments and bureaus within the ministry to pay close attention to this issue.

### 中央纺织工业部办公厅检讨随便抄送文件的错误

    中央纺织工业部办公厅检讨随便抄送文件的错误
    中央人民政府纺织工业部办公厅来信：七月十八日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏中所载刘锡九同志对我部随便抄送文件的批评是完全正确的。
    今年五月十五日，我部接到中南区纺织纤维检验所报告一件，提出今年棉花品级标准仿制工作任务重大，由中南区各有关机关联合组织的中南区棉花品级标准仿制委员会需要宽大的工作场所，请求我部行文中南财政经济委员会拨给房屋。中南区的财经机关找办公房屋，一般应当直接向中南财政经济委员会及当地房屋管理机构联系。我们接到中南区纺织纤维检验所的报告，就应当直截了当地这样答复；但是我们没有这样作，却答应了他们的要求直接请中南财政经济委员会设法解决。同时，我们又认为中南财政经济委员会属于中央财政经济委员会直接领导，而参加中南区棉花品级标准仿制委员会的单位有中南合作管理局及花纱布公司，就不考虑是否有必要而随便把这件公文抄给这些单位的领导机关——中央财政经济委员会、中华全国合作社联合总社及中央商业部。这一个稿件，经过层层核稿签署，但都没有发现这样抄送文件是不对的。
    我们平素处理公文中存在着的严重的文牍主义和官僚主义，在反官僚主义斗争中已经作了揭发和检讨。刘锡九同志的批评更加提高了我们对这方面的注意。我们决心进一步纠正处理公文时的文牍主义倾向，现已通知部内各司、局办稿、核稿人员切实注意这个问题。
