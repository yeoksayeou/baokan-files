The Ninth District of Qionglai County, Sichuan Province, is a remote hilly and mountainous area, producing a large quantity of local products. Local farmers mainly rely on selling these products to make a living. In order to support farmers' production, the district supply and marketing cooperative went deep into the villages to investigate the output and quality of local products, and to understand where these products were sold. Based on the production and sales of local products, the cooperative adopted the method of "ordering based on sales," first signing processing contracts with other places, and then organizing procurement. For example, the district produces more than 100,000 jin of palm bark annually, so the cooperative organized local handicraft workers to make 300,000 jin of double-headed palm ropes and 10,000 binding ropes, in order to sell the finished products to Ya'an and Lushan in Xikang Province. Because of the "ordering based on sales" method, the cooperative can collect and transport products simultaneously, accelerating capital turnover and avoiding the phenomenon of commodity backlog. The cooperative's cadres have also learned to inspect local products, correctly implementing the policy of "better goods, better prices." As a result, farmers are eager to sell their local products. In the first and second quarters of this year, the cooperative has purchased local and sideline products worth 430 million yuan. At the same time as purchasing, it also supplied farmers with more than 2,000 pieces of large and small farm tools and more than 38,000 jin of various fertilizers, strongly supporting agricultural production increase.

While carrying out the purchase and sale of local products, the cooperative also guided farmers in the production of local products. It encouraged farmers to produce more of the local products that sell well; for those that do not sell well now or in the future, it advised farmers to engage in other production to avoid wasting manpower and materials. For local products that sell well but do not meet the specifications, the cooperative helps farmers improve their technology. The general farmers reflected, "The cooperative not only buys local products, but also helps us increase production."

In order to avoid private merchants lowering purchase prices during the off-season, the cooperative determined the purchase prices of local products to prevent farmers from suffering losses. It also organized private merchants to operate part of the local products to expand the production and sales of local products.

    四川省邛崃县九区供销合作社
    积极推销农民土特产品
    四川省邛崃县九区是偏僻的丘陵和大山地区，出产大宗土特产品，当地农民主要依靠出售土特产品维持生活。该区供销合作社为了扶助农民生产，深入到村里调查土特产的产量、品质，并了解这些土特产的销地。根据土特产产销情况，采取“以销订购”的办法，先与外地订立加工合同，然后组织收购。比如该区年产棕皮十多万斤，合作社就组织当地手工业者制成双头棕绳三十万斤，缚绳一万根，以便把成品推销到西康雅安、芦山等地。由于有了
    “以销订购”的办法，合作社便可以边收边运，加速了资金周转，避免了商品积压现象。该社干部并学会了土特产检验工作，正确地执行了“优货优价”的政策。因而农民踊跃卖出土产。今年一、二季度已收购价值四亿三千万元的土特产品和副业产品。在收购同时还供应了农民大小农具二千余件，各种肥料三万八千余斤，有力地支持了农业增产。
    该社在开展土特产购销同时，还指导了农民土特产的生产。对销路较广的土特产，则鼓励农民多生产；对目前和以后没有销路的，则劝告农民从事其他生产，以免浪费人力、物力。对销路广，但不合规格的土特产，合作社则帮助农民改进技术。一般农民反映说：“合作社不单是收购土特产，并且帮助我们增产。”
    为了避免在淡季时私商压低收购价格，合作社确定了土特产品的收购价格，免使农民受到损失。并组织私商经营一部分土特产，以扩大土特产的产销工作。
