On the Battlefront of National Economic Construction

The Sanhe Sluice Gate on the Lower Reaches of the Huai River Releases Water

The massive Sanhe Sluice Gate, recently completed on the southeastern shore of Hongze Lake in the lower reaches of the Huai River, has begun to shoulder the great tasks of flood control, irrigation, and navigation. On the morning of July 26th, the Sanhe Sluice Gate Engineering Headquarters held a grand water release ceremony to celebrate the birth of the giant gate and to commend model workers and labor heroes among the civilian laborers. More than 30,000 workers, civilian laborers, and cadres attended the ceremony.

After Chen Ketian, the commander of the Sanhe Sluice Gate Engineering Headquarters, delivered a summary report on the Sanhe Sluice Gate project, Leng Yu, the vice chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government, presided over the ribbon-cutting ceremony. When the button was pressed, the gate slowly rose, and the waters of Hongze Lake surged into the new channel, the workers, civilian laborers, labor heroes, and representatives from various places standing on and around the Sanhe Sluice Gate bridge erupted in thunderous cheers. Amidst the playing of music and the rushing water, the Sanhe Sluice Gate began to undertake its historical mission.

At the water release ceremony, a total of 120 special-class and first-class labor heroes were gloriously commended. This included fitter Xu Wengao, who created a screw machine that increased work efficiency fivefold; young worker Xiong Keqing, who promoted the implementation of assembly line operations in his team, increasing steel bar binding efficiency fourfold; carpenter Xi Shunsheng, who proposed the most rationalization suggestions; Liu Feihu (formerly known as Liu Hengwen), a civilian laborer from Huaiyin County, and Chen Shubu, a civilian laborer from Liuhe County, who created the "Dragon Somersault Ladder Excavation Method"; and Gao Xiuying, a seventeen-year-old female squad leader of the Huaiyin County Civilian Laborer Corps. In addition, ninety model units were collectively commended.

The ceremony also enthusiastically passed a telegram expressing respect and gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Volunteers. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

Fengfeng Coal Mine Uses Winches to Generate Electricity on Downward Slopes

The pit car hoisting in the Fengfeng Mining Bureau uses single-hook winches, and their total horsepower accounts for 14.6% of the total electricity consumption. In the past, when empty cars went downhill, no power was supplied (the electrical switch was off), and the winch driver used brakes to control the winch speed. Such a large amount of power was wasted in vain. Comrade Bogatyrev, a Soviet electrical expert, pointed out that the power of the coal car going downhill should be utilized to generate electricity on the downhill slope. The Electromechanical Department of the North China Coal Mine Administration followed the expert's instructions and successfully conducted experiments in the Fengfeng Mining Bureau in the second quarter of this year.

Downhill power generation uses the power of the empty tank of a single-hook winch in an inclined shaft to drive the motor to exceed its originally specified speed and generate electricity. This reduces the electricity consumption from the power plant, and power can be generated without adding any equipment, and brake pads are saved. A 300-horsepower electric winch alone can generate an average of 32 kilowatts of electricity. If it pulls 120 hooks per day, with a power generation time of two and a half minutes per hook, it can generate 160 kilowatt-hours per day. Each winch can increase the country's electricity supply by 57,600 kilowatt-hours per year. If all single-hook winches in the entire mine implement downhill power generation, the increase in electrical power will be significant. (Tang Yun)

He Yuanhai Creates a Crash Course Method for Workers to Learn Blueprint Reading

He Yuanhai, an engineer at Southwest Factory 152, studied with workers and created a crash course method for learning blueprint reading, enabling workers who could not read blueprints to understand drawings after six hours of study, solving the difficulty of workers reading blueprints.

In the past, workers generally did not understand how to read blueprints and could only work according to samples. The old methods of teaching blueprint reading focused on abstract geometric concepts such as points, lines, surfaces, and projections. Workers with low levels of education could not accept them, and after studying for a long time, they still could not operate according to the drawings. To solve the difficulty of workers reading blueprints, engineer He Yuanhai spent more than a year exploring, studying the difficulties workers encountered in recognizing drawings, and widely soliciting workers' opinions to compile teaching materials. He first taught everyone to recognize simple basic drawings such as circles, squares, and triangles, then to recognize the shapes of mechanical part models, then to recognize the drawings of the models from the models, and finally to recognize the models from the drawings in reverse. He proceeded from the recognition of external shapes to the recognition of internal shapes and cross-sections, from the recognition of dimensions, tolerances, and symbols to the recognition of charts, from the simple to the profound, and from the practical to the abstract. After each lesson, He Yuanhai participated in the workers' group discussions, listened to everyone's opinions on the teaching, and improved his teaching materials and teaching methods. After six sessions (one hour each), most of the people who participated in the learning were able to recognize the drawings.

Hunan Province Completes This Year's Logging Task

Fifty Percent of the Timber Has Been Transported to the Collection Yards

After completing this year's logging task, the Hunan Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau had transported approximately 50% of the timber to the final collection yards by the end of June. On the tributaries and rivers of the Xiangjiang, Zishui, and Yuanjiang river basins, continuous rafts of wood flow downstream every day. At the final collection yards such as Zoushi, Yiyang, and Zhuzhou, the wood rafts moored along the river stretch for ten to twenty li.

Hunan Province is one of the regions in China within the customs that is rich in timber. Forests cover 11% of the province's total area. In the past, the highest annual output reached 800,000 cubic meters, of which 75% was fir wood needed for construction. This year, in order not to delay the construction plans of more than 100 basic construction units in Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, and Central South China that had placed orders, the Hunan Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau mobilized more than 40,000 workers for logging work during the spring and summer seasons and sent working groups to provide logging technical guidance to farmers with private forests. In order to safely transport the timber accumulated in the mountains, streams, and rivers to the delivery locations in a timely manner, more than 12,000 timber transportation workers launched a labor competition. Under the current difficulties of drought, low water levels, and the inability of small rivers to transport the timber, they not only adopted methods such as segmented transportation to improve transportation efficiency, but also actively tried to remove shoals and repair river channels, and made preparations so that they could rush to transport the timber as soon as the rain rises.

Yimeng Mountain Area Actively Improves Sheep Breeds

The people of the Yimeng Mountain area in Shandong Province are actively improving sheep breeds to develop animal husbandry in the mountainous area. The Yimeng Mountain area has many good pastures, and the people in the mountainous area have long regarded raising sheep as a major sideline. However, the original sheep in the mountainous area could only produce about two kilograms of wool per year, and the wool was coarse and not suitable for weaving fine woolen fabrics. In order to develop animal husbandry in the mountainous area, the Shandong Provincial People's Government established a breeding sheep farm in Changle County as early as 1951. This breeding sheep farm now has more than 440 Corriedale sheep (an Australian breed) with both wool and meat qualities. Each sheep can produce about 20 kilograms of wool per year. Last fall, the Changle Breeding Sheep Farm established six Corriedale sheep breeding stations in Juyi, Yiyuan, and Linqu counties in the Yimeng Mountain area, using artificial insemination to breed local sheep. After the autumn, more than half of the 3,000 sheep bred in the entire area produced lambs. These lambs grow quickly and produce more wool. Ma Chengzhang of Zhima Village in Juyi County has a seven-month-old lamb produced by breeding, which now weighs more than 80 kilograms, almost catching up with the weight of local adult sheep. Gao Qizhi of Zhujiapo Village in Linqu County has a lamb produced by breeding that looks very much like a purebred Corriedale sheep. The first shearing produced 5.4 kilograms of wool, which is more than double the annual wool production of local adult sheep. The wool produced by these lambs is fine, long, and soft, suitable for weaving fine woolen fabrics. The price is higher than local wool, and the income of the people in the mountainous area has increased compared to the past. This year, the scope of Corriedale sheep breeding in the Yimeng Mountain area has been expanded to five counties, including Yishui and Yinan, and nine breeding stations have been established. The summer breeding has already begun, and the Lyujiaya breeding station in Linqu County alone had bred more than 200 sheep in June. (Xinhua News Agency)

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    淮河下游三河闸放水
    淮河下游洪泽湖东南岸新近建成的巨大三河闸，已开始担负防洪、灌溉、航运的伟大任务。七月二十六日清晨，三河闸工程指挥部举行了隆重的放水典礼，庆祝巨闸诞生，奖励模范工人和民工中的劳动模范。参加典礼的工人、民工和干部共有三万多人。
    典礼在三河闸工程指挥部指挥陈克天做了关于三河闸工程的总结报告后，由江苏省人民政府副主席冷遹主持剪彩。当电钮开动，闸门慢慢升起，洪泽湖的水流汹涌地被引入新河道时，站在三河闸桥上及两端的工人、民工们，劳动模范们，各地代表们欢呼雷动。在音乐鸣奏、急水哗响中，三河闸开始担负了她历史上的任务。
    在放水典礼上，光荣地受到奖励的计有特等劳动模范和一等劳动模范一百二十人。其中包括创造螺丝机提高工作效率五倍的钳工许文高，推动全队实行流水作业法使扎钢筋效率提高四倍的青年工人熊克卿，提出合理化建议最多的木工奚顺生，创造“龙翻身梯形挖土法”的淮阴县民工刘飞虎（原名刘恒文）和六合县民工陈书步，以及淮阴县民工总队十七岁的女小队长高秀英等。此外，并有九十个模范单位集体受到奖励。
    典礼并热烈地通过电文，分别向毛主席和中国人民志愿军表示敬意和感谢。（据新华社讯）
    峰峰煤矿利用绞车下坡发电
    峰峰矿务局坑下提升矿车，都是单钩绞车，其总马力数占全部用电的百分之十四点六。过去空车下坡时不给电（不合电门），由绞车司机用抱闸来控制绞车的转速。这么大的动力竟白白浪费了。苏联电气专家保加得廖夫同志指出要利用煤车下坡的动力，实行下坡发电。华北煤矿管理局机电处，按着专家的指示，今年第二季度在峰峰矿务局进行试验成功。
    下坡发电就是利用斜井单钩绞车空罐下坡的动力，带动马达使其超过原来规定的速度发出电来。这就减少了对电厂的用电，不用增添任何设备就可发出电功率，并且节省闸皮。仅三百马力电绞车，平均能发出三十二基罗瓦特的电功率，每天拉一百二十钩，每钩发电时间按二分半计算，每天可发电一百六十度，每年一部绞车就可给国家增加五万七千六百度电。如果全矿所有单钩绞车都实行下坡发电，将会增加很大的电功率。（唐允）
    何源海创造工人速成识图法
    西南一五二厂工程师何源海与工人研究，创造了速成识图法，使不能识图的工人，经过六小时学习，就能看懂图样，解决了工人识图的困难。
    过去工人一般都不懂看图，只能照样板工作。旧的教图方法，讲的多是点、线、面及投影之类抽象的几何概念，工人文化低，接受不了，学了很长时间仍不能照图操作。为了解决工人识图的困难，何源海工程师经过一年多的摸索，研究了工人认图中的困难，广泛地征求了工人的意见，编写了教材。他先教大家认清楚圆形、方形及三角形等简单的基本图样，然后认识机械零件的模型的形状，再从模型认识模型的图样，最后反过来从图样认识模型，并且由外形的认识到内形、剖面的认识，从尺寸、公差、符号的认识到图表的认识，由浅入深，由实际到抽象。每讲完一课后，何源海都参加工人的小组讨论，听取大家对教学的意见，改进自己的教材和教学方法。这样经过六次（每次一小时）的学习，参加学习的人绝大部分都能认识图样了。
    湖南省完成今年采伐任务
    百分之五十的木材已运到集材场
    湖南省森林工业局在完成今年的采伐任务后，到六月底为止已有百分之五十左右的木材运到各终点集材场。湘江、资水、沅江三水流域的溪里、河里，每天都有连续不断的木排沿着河水顺流而下。各终点集材场如陬市、益阳、株州等地沿河停泊的木排，长达十里至二十里不等。
    湖南省是我国关内盛产木材的地区之一，森林面积占全省总面积百分之十一，过去最高年产量达八十万立方公尺，其中百分之七十五为建筑所需的杉木。今年湖南省森林工业局为不耽误已订货的东北、西北、西南、中南一百多个基本建设单位的施工计划，在今年春夏两季曾动员了四万多工人进行采伐工作，并派出工作组对私有林的农民进行采伐技术指导。为了及时把堆积在山里、溪水里和河里的待运木材安全地运到交货地点，一万二千多名运木工人展开了劳动竞赛。他们在目前天旱水小和小河不能运输的困难情况下，不但采取分段运输等办法来提高运输效率，同时还积极设法清除滩险，整修河道，抓紧做好各项准备工作，以便等到下雨水涨时立刻进行抢运。（新华社）
    沂蒙山区积极改良羊种
    山东省沂蒙山区人民为发展山区畜牧业，正在积极改良羊种。沂蒙山区有许多良好的牧场，山区人民很早就把饲养绵羊作为一项主要副业。但是，山区原有的绵羊每只每年只能产毛二斤左右，而且毛质粗糙，不适宜纺织细致的毛织品。为了发展山区畜牧业，山东省人民政府早在一九五一年便在昌乐县设立了一处种羊场。这个种羊场现在有着毛肉兼优的考利代尔羊（澳大利亚品种）四百四十多只，每头羊一年可产毛二十斤左右。去年秋天，昌乐种羊场就在沂蒙山区的莒沂、沂源、临朐等三县设立了六处考利代尔羊配种站，用人工授精的方法为当地羊群配种。秋后，全区所配的三千头羊就有半数以上产了羔。这些羊羔长得快、产毛多。莒沂县芝马峪村马成章有一头配种产的七个月的羊羔，现在已经有八十多斤重，差不多赶上了当地成年羊的重量。临朐县朱家坡村高齐志有一头配种产的羊羔很像纯种的考利代尔羊，第一次剪毛就有五斤四两，比当地成年羊的全年产毛量还多一倍以上。这些羊羔所产的羊毛细长柔软，适于纺织细致的毛织品，价格较当地羊毛高，山区人民的收入因而比过去增加了。沂蒙山区今年考利代尔羊配种的范围已经扩大到沂水、沂南等五个县，共设立了九处配种站。现在夏季配种已经开始，仅临朐县吕家崖配种站在六月份就已经配羊二百多只。（新华社）
