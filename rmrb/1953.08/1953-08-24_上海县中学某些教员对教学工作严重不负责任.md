    Some Teachers at Shanghai County Middle School Are Seriously Irresponsible in Their Teaching

    A letter from Ke Fu, a teacher at Shanghai County Middle School: The phenomenon of irresponsibility among some teachers at our school is very serious in their teaching. The rate of teacher absenteeism is alarming, seriously affecting the progress and effectiveness of teaching. For example, in the junior high school third grade physiology and hygiene class, with only five weeks left in the semester, only twenty-three pages of the textbook had been taught, leaving one hundred and thirteen pages unaddressed. Another example is that a certain high school physical education teacher often does not show up for class on time, leaving the students to play in the playground. A certain art teacher is always five to ten minutes late for each class, rarely prepares before class, and then takes out kerosene lamps or bottles for the students to draw, or asks the students to go "sketching" outside the school. Some students go off to play or even go home for dinner, and he doesn't care. Similar phenomena are numerous. Many students have raised objections to the irresponsible teaching attitude of some teachers, but they do not humbly accept them. The Chinese language teacher in a certain group of first-year junior high school students writes simplified characters on the blackboard that few people recognize; when students are dissatisfied, he says, "These are 'liberated characters'!" When students in the third year of junior high school and the first year of high school offer opinions on the teaching of the Chinese language teacher, the teacher not only does not accept them but also propagates everywhere that the students are bad.

    The emergence of these problems is due to the lack of leadership from the school's teaching affairs office, which rarely inquires about teaching matters; the Youth League branch turns a blind eye to the serious chaos in the school and fails to conduct ideological education work for League members and other young teachers; and the grass-roots committee of the education trade union has simply done nothing. It is hoped that the Shanghai County People's Government's cultural and educational departments will inspect our school's work and urge the school to make improvements.

### 上海县中学某些教员对教学工作严重不负责任

    上海县中学某些教员对教学工作严重不负责任
    上海县中学教员柯夫来信：我校某些教师在教学工作中不负责任的现象非常严重。教员缺勤率很惊人，严重影响了教学进度和教学效果。如初中三年级的生理卫生课在上学期只差五星期就要结束的时候，课本只教了二十三页，还有一百十三页没有教。又如某高中体育教师经常到时不上课，任凭学生在操场上玩闹。某美术教师每次上课总要迟到五分钟到十多分钟，课前很少作准备工作，到上课时临时拿出火油灯或瓶子之类的东西叫学生去画，或者叫学生到校外去“写生”，有的学生随便去玩了或者索兴回家吃饭了，他也不管。类似的现象，还多得很。许多学生对于某些教师这种不负责任的教学态度提出意见，他们也不虚心接受。初中一年级某组的语文教师在黑板上乱写很少人认识的简体字；学生不满意，他反而说：“这是‘解放字’啊！”初中三年级和高中一年级的学生对语文教师教学方面提意见，教师不但不接受，反到处宣传说是学生如何不好。
    以上这些问题的产生，因我校教导处对教师缺乏领导，平素很少过问教学业务；青年团支部对学校中严重的混乱现象视若无睹，不对团员和其他青年教师进行思想教育工作；教育工会基层委员会则简直没有做什么工作。希望上海县人民政府文教部门检查我校工作，督促校方进行改进。
