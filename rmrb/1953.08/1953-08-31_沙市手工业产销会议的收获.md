Gains of the Shashi Handicraft Production and Sales Conference

To solve the problem of sluggish sales of handicraft products during the off-season, Shashi in Hubei Province, under the leadership of the Shashi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shashi Finance and Economics Committee, convened a handicraft production and sales conference in early July. In addition to the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth company, the department store wholesale station, and the state-owned local trading company, participants included twelve handicraft industries such as weaving, knitting, umbrellas, toothbrushes, flour mills, ironware, and leather goods, as well as private merchants dealing in piece goods, general merchandise, native product transportation, and mountain and local fruits. This conference was conducted based on the principle of "voluntary participation, mutual benefit, and mutual trust." Transactions were mainly based on processing orders, with relatively few cash-on-delivery and forward transactions. The conference agreed on a total processing and acquisition amount of over 2.12 billion yuan, of which the state-owned cotton yarn and cloth supply station and the department store wholesale station accounted for about 90% of the orders, while private acquisitions accounted for about 10%.

Through this conference, a portion of handicraft products was sold, and production order agreements sufficient for more than two months were established for these industries. This solved the problem of off-season sales for these major handicraft industries, enabling them to recover from a state of semi-shutdown during the off-season to normal production, and to transition directly into preparing for peak season production. At the same time, it also powerfully promoted changes in the operating styles of the handicraft industries, improved the quality and specifications of products, reduced costs, and broke down conservative thinking. In the past, when demand exceeded supply during the peak season, handicrafts were often produced coarsely and shoddily. After this production and sales conference, mutual criticism was launched, educating handicraft workers that only by improving the quality and specifications of products, producing meticulously, and honestly achieving good quality and low prices can products be trusted and welcomed by sellers and consumers. For example, the toothbrushes produced by the toothbrush industry were welcomed at the conference for their durability. The weaving industry, after detailed study of foreign goods, especially Shanghai's "Ge Hua Fuchou" (patterned filature silk), made "Chong Fuchou" (imitatation filature silk) suitable for people's needs. After seeing it, the silk cloth industry not only purchased a portion but also ordered more than 1,000 bolts. The famous Shashi "Sancha Road Umbrellas" were also welcomed by representatives due to reasonable cost adjustments and price reductions. The knitting industry, which had always believed that its socks were very marketable and did not think there would be any problems, was not very interested in the production and sales conference. However, at the conference, department store representatives criticized the industry, saying that men's socks were too small for adults but too big for children, and the quality was poor, breaking easily when the foot was stretched. Only then did they realize that only by improving technology and quality could they open up sales channels.

Finally, this conference enabled handicrafts to closely connect with various urban economies under the leadership and assistance of the state-owned economy, promoting and developing each other. At the same time, it also helped cadres of state-owned commerce and cooperatives to further clarify their policies toward handicrafts. In the past, Shashi's public and private businesses purchased the most industrial and handicraft products from Shanghai, always believing that the products of this city were inferior and difficult to sell. For some products, such as cloth and socks, state-owned companies rarely inspected them during processing, leading to a decrease in product quality and specifications, and further disconnection between production and sales. This time, due to the proactive "bridging" by handicraft workers, and the leading role of the state-owned trading company in organizing forums for representatives of handicrafts and private businesses to present samples for them to choose from, a preliminary production and sales relationship was established due to good quality and low prices. This connected handicrafts with various economies in the city. At the same time, it also strengthened the leading role of state-owned trade and cooperatives in the production of local handicrafts, and divided the distribution of handicraft products with private businesses, eliminating the phenomenon of blindly "contracting processing" to support handicrafts in the past. This not only prevented the accumulation of state funds but also played a significant role in improving the quality and reducing the cost of handicrafts. (Gong Sha)

    沙市手工业产销会议的收获
    湖北省沙市为了解决手工业品淡季滞销问题，于七月上旬在中共沙市市委会和沙市财政经济委员会领导下，召开了一次手工业产销会议。参加这次会议的除国营花纱布公司、百货批发站、国营地方贸易公司外，手工业有织布、针织、雨伞、牙刷、粉坊、铁器、皮件等十二个行业，私商方面有匹头、百货、土产运销、山货土果、绳蔑组等业。这次会议是在“自觉自愿，互利互信”的原则下进行的，在交易上以加工定购为主，现款现货，现款期货比较少。会议议定加工收购总额达二十一亿二千余万元，其中国营花纱布供应站、百货批发站定货达百分之九十左右，私营收购定货占百分之十左右。
    通过这次会议，推销了一部分手工业产品，并成立了足够这些行业两个月以上的生产定货协议，解决了这几个主要手工行业产品的淡季销路问题，使他们从淡季的半停工状态恢复了正常生产，并可紧接着转入准备旺季生产。同时，还有力地促进手工行业改变经营作风，改进产品的品质和规格，减低了成本，打破了保守思想。过去手工业在旺季供不应求时，往往粗制滥造，经过这次产销会议，展开了互相批评，教育了手工业者只有改进产品的品质和规格，精工细制，产品才有销路，只有减低成本，老老实实的做到物美价廉，才能受到销售者和消费者的信任与欢迎。如牙刷业出产的牙刷质坚耐用，在会上便受到欢迎。织布业在交易中经过详细研究了外来货，特别研究了上海的格花府绸，做出了适合于人民需要的充府绸，绸布业看到后，除现购了一部分外，并另订购了一千多匹。而出名的沙市“三岔路雨伞”，因合理调整了成本，减低了价格，也受到了代表的欢迎。一向认为自己所织的袜子很时销的针织业，总以为不会有什么问题，对产销会议不怎样感兴趣，但在会上百货业代表对该业提出批评：男袜子大人穿太小，小孩穿又太大，且品质不好，脚一伸就破。他们才认识到只有提高技术、改进质量才能打开销路。
    最后，通过这次会议使手工业在国营经济的领导和扶助下，与城市各种经济密切联系起来，相互推动，相互发展。同时，也提高了国营商业和合作社的干部进一步明确了对待手工业的方针。过去，沙市公私营商业从上海购进工业和手工业产品最多，总以为本市产品差，不易销售，有的产品如布匹、袜子等，国营公司在加工时就很少检查，以致产品品质规格降低，生产和销售更形脱节。这次由于手工业者主动进行“搭桥”，国营贸易公司在里面起带头作用，组织了手工业和私营商业代表座谈，提出样品让他们选择；由于品质好，价钱便宜，相互间便初步建立了产销关系，这就使手工业与该市各种经济联系起来。同时也使国营贸易、合作社加强了对地方手工业生产的领导作用，和私营商业分工经销手工业产品，消除了过去盲目“包干加工”来扶植手工业的现象。这样，不但使国家资金免于积压，同时对手工业改进品质、降低成本都起了很大作用。    （龚沙）
