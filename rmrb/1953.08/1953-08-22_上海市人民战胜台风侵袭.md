    The people of Shanghai conquered the typhoon. Starting at noon on the 16th, a typhoon struck Shanghai for three consecutive days, with maximum winds reaching levels 9 to 10, the largest typhoon attack this year. Before the typhoon hit, the Shanghai Flood Control Headquarters led the masses in the suburban areas along the coast to reinforce the low-lying sections of the dikes, ensuring the safety of the sea dikes and river embankments. Warehouses and factories in the urban area also made preparations for defense in advance, and all units had personnel on duty at night and on holidays, so no accidents occurred. The district people's governments and neighborhood resident committees also attached great importance to the safety of residents and did their best to provide necessary assistance and care.

    上海市人民战胜台风侵袭
    上海市人民战胜了台风侵袭。十六日中午起，台风侵袭上海市连续三天，最大风力达九级到十级，为今年以来最大一次台风袭击。上海市防汛总指挥部在台风侵入前即领导沿海塘各郊区群众抢修堤岸的低洼地段，确保了海塘和江堤的安全。市区各个仓库、工厂事前也都做好了防御工作，晚上和例假日各单位都派有值班人员，因而未发生事故。各区人民政府和里弄居民委员等也都很重视居民的安全，尽力进行了必要的帮助和照顾。（新华社）
