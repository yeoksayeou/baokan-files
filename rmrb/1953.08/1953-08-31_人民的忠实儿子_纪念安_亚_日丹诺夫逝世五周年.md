    The People's Loyal Son
    ——Commemorating the Fifth Anniversary of the Death of A. A. Zhdanov
    Soviet Union En. Luogenuofu
    Lenin once wrote: Great revolutions, in the course of their own struggles, always produce great figures, and some geniuses that have never existed before. Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov was such an outstanding figure of genius from the masses of the great October Socialist Revolution.
    Zhdanov was born in 1896 in the city of Mariupol in southern Russia, the son of a teacher. At the age of sixteen (1912), he moved with his father to the city of Tver (not far from Moscow), and then joined the Tver (now Kalinin) Social Democratic Youth Student Group to engage in revolutionary activities.
    In 1915, Zhdanov joined the ranks of the Bolshevik Party and actively carried out Party work among the workers.
    During the First World War, he was mobilized into the army. Loyal to the ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the cause of proletarian internationalism, he engaged in revolutionary propaganda among the soldiers and then actively participated in the preparation and launching of the Great October Socialist Revolution.
    After the victory of the revolution, he unswervingly completed the important work of the Party and the Soviets in the Urals, in the Tver Province (now Kalinin Province), and in the Gorky Province.
    At the Fourteenth Party Congress (December 1925), Zhdanov was elected an alternate member of the Central Committee, and at the Sixteenth Party Congress (June 1930) became a member of the Party Central Committee. He participated in the Party's leadership core headed by Stalin, which, since Lenin's death, had been defending the great banner of Leninism in constant struggle with vacillators, capitulators, Trotskyites, Zinovievites, and Bukharinites, guiding the Soviet people onto the broad road of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and ensuring socialist construction in the Soviet Union.
    In December 1934, after the assassination of Kirov, the secretary of the Leningrad Provincial Committee, by Trotskyites and Zinovievites, the Party sent Zhdanov to Leningrad to lead the work of the Party organization. In carrying out the Party's will, Zhdanov, with his inherent enthusiasm for the Party, inspired and mobilized the Leningrad Party organization to eliminate the Trotskyite-Zinovievite double-dealers and traitors, making the Leningrad communists more closely united around the Party Central Committee.
    On the eve of the Eighteenth Party Congress (March 1939), the Party Central Committee appointed Zhdanov to lead the Party's propaganda work. He participated in the Eighteenth Party Congress and delivered a report on the issue of Party building. After the Eighteenth Party Congress, Zhdanov was elected a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party Central Committee.
    During the years of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet people against the Hitler aggressors, the Party and the government appointed Zhdanov to organize the defense of Leningrad. Under the leadership of Zhdanov, the Leningrad Party organization became the soul of the heroic defense of Leningrad in order to realize the instructions of the Party Central Committee. Zhdanov's speeches during the difficult years of the Great Patriotic War were full of firm confidence in defeating fascism and pride in the great Soviet people. Under the most difficult conditions of Leningrad's siege by the enemy, Zhdanov took all measures to change the serious situation of the defenders of the heroic city.
    After the victory of the Great Patriotic War, when the Communist Party and the Soviet people embarked on peaceful construction, ideological work occupied a very important position in the life of the Party and the state. As an outstanding theorist and brilliant propagandist of Marxism-Leninism, Zhdanov made a series of reports on various issues of literature, art, philosophy, and on the international situation. These reports are important contributions to the development of Marxist-Leninist theory. These reports helped to publicize achievements and overcome shortcomings on the ideological front, and specified the path for the further development of Soviet socialist culture. Zhdanov was a shining example of a leader who was good at combining daily socialist construction work with in-depth research on Marxist-Leninist theoretical issues.
    In his extremely famous report on the Leningrad magazines "Star" and "Leningrad," Zhdanov exposed the shortcomings and errors existing on the Leningrad literary front, calling on Soviet writers to move forward to new achievements and write realistic works with high ideological content and high artistry. These works should educate the Soviet people in the spirit of absolute loyalty to the Soviet motherland and in the spirit of communism.
    Zhdanov said: "Soviet writers and all our ideological workers are currently on the forefront because under the conditions of peaceful development, the tasks of the ideological front, especially the tasks of literature, have not been lowered but have been intensified. The people, the state, and the Party demand that literature not be divorced from current life, and that literature actively participate in all aspects of Soviet life." Zhdanov pointed out that the Party Central Committee requires the state to have a rich spiritual culture because it sees in this cultural wealth a major task of socialism.
    In his speech at the philosophical discussion meeting in June 1947, Zhdanov profoundly elucidated the great revolutionary changes that had been completed in the history of philosophy with the advent of Marxism, provided a scientific definition of the object of the history of philosophy, and established the basic principles of the Marxist history of philosophy. In this speech, Zhdanov sharply criticized objectivism and political indifference in philosophical work, and condemned the attitude of ignoring current topics and kowtowing to bourgeois philosophy. He called on philosophical workers to boldly develop criticism and self-criticism, theoretically summarize the experience of socialist construction and the achievements of modern natural science, and resolutely fight against bourgeois idealism.
    Zhdanov pointed out: "From the ashes of gunfire, many new democratic countries and the national liberation movements of colonial peoples have grown. Socialism has been put on the agenda of the lives of all nations. Who else besides us, besides the countries where socialism has already triumphed and their philosophers, can help our foreign friends and brothers illuminate the road of their struggle with scientific socialist consciousness? Who else besides us can inspire them and arm them with the Marxist ideological weapon?"
    In his speech at the meeting of Soviet musicians convened by the Party Central Committee in January 1948, Zhdanov elaborated on the issue of improving Soviet music. He criticized the peculiar formalistic tendencies of those Soviet musicians who ignored Russian classical music and the fine traditions of Russian classical opera, and at the same time explained the issues of internationalism and nationalism in art. He emphasized that internationalism in art is not produced on the basis of the weakening and impoverishment of national art, but only on the basis of the prosperity of national art can internationalism be produced, just as in music, a person who does not truly love his own country cannot become an internationalist in music.
    A. A. Zhdanov was one of the great activists of the international workers' movement. His contribution is immeasurable in strengthening the ties between the revolutionary workers and peasants throughout the country and in uniting the forces of the international anti-imperialist democratic camp against the instigators of new wars. In demonstrating the increasing international significance and prestige of the Soviet Union, and demonstrating its great progressive role, Zhdanov emphasized that the Soviet Union is a loyal supporter of the freedom and independence of all peoples and an enemy of any kind of national and racial oppression and colonial oppression.
    As a loyal son of the people, A. A. Zhdanov infinitely trusted the strength and talent of the Soviet people and tirelessly cared for the training of cadres for communist construction and the high development of moral character. Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov dedicated his entire life to serving the people and serving the great cause of communism. He dedicated all his energy to completing any task entrusted by the Party. Zhdanov was a loyal student of the genius Lenin, a comrade-in-arms of the great Stalin, and A. A. Zhdanov won the love of the Party and all the working people of the Soviet Union with his active activities for the happiness of the Soviet state and his infinite loyalty to the Communist Party. Zhdanov gave a lot of help to the Soviet people and the people of other countries in correctly grasping Marxist-Leninist ideas.

    人民的忠实儿子
    ——纪念安·亚·日丹诺夫逝世五周年
    苏联  恩·罗格诺夫
    列宁曾经写道：伟大的革命在其本身的斗争过程中总会提供出伟大的人物，出现一些过去从未有过的天才。安得烈·亚历山德罗维奇·日丹诺夫就是这样一个来自伟大的十月社会主义革命的群众中的天才的卓越人物。
    日丹诺夫生于一八九六年俄国南部玛利巴里城一位教员的家中。他在十六岁（一九一二年）的时候，随父亲迁居特维里城（离莫斯科不远），随后就加入了特维里（现在的加里宁城）社会民主党青年学生小组从事革命运动。
    一九一五年日丹诺夫加入了布尔什维克党的队伍，在工人中间积极进行党的工作。
    第一次世界大战时他被动员加入军队。由于忠实于马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义的事业，他在士兵中间从事革命宣传，之后就积极参加伟大的十月社会主义革命的准备和发动工作。
    革命胜利后，他在乌拉尔，在特维里州（现在的加里宁州）和高尔基州始终不渝地完成党和苏维埃的重要工作。
    第十四次党代表大会上（一九二五年十二月），日丹诺夫当选候补中央委员，在第十六次党代表大会上（一九三○年六月）成为党中央委员。他参加了以斯大林为首的党的领导核心，这一个领导核心从列宁死后一直是在和不坚定分子、投降分子，在和托洛茨基分子、季诺维也夫分子、布哈林分子作不断的斗争中捍卫了列宁主义的伟大旗帜，引导苏联人民走上了国家工业化和农业集体化的康庄大道，保证了在苏联的社会主义建设。
    一九三四年十二月，列宁格勒州委书记基洛夫遭托洛茨基、季诺维也夫分子凶杀后，党委派日丹诺夫去列宁格勒领导党组织的工作。在执行党的意志时，日丹诺夫以其固有的对党的热情，鼓舞和动员列宁格勒党的组织清除掉托洛茨基、季诺维也夫两面派和叛徒，使列宁格勒的共产党员更紧密地团结在党中央委员会的周围。
    第十八次党代表大会（一九三九年三月）的前夕，党中央委员会委任日丹诺夫来领导党的宣传鼓动工作。他参加了第十八次党代表大会并作了关于党的建设问题的报告。第十八次党代表大会以后日丹诺夫当选共产党中央委员会政治局的委员。
    在苏联人民反对希特勒侵略者的伟大卫国战争年月里，党和政府委派日丹诺夫组织列宁格勒的保卫战。列宁格勒党的组织在日丹诺夫领导下，为实现党中央委员会的指示而成了列宁格勒英勇保卫战的灵魂。日丹诺夫在伟大卫国战争艰苦年月中所作的演讲，充满着战胜法西斯的坚强信心和为伟大苏联人民而感到的自豪。在列宁格勒遭受敌人封锁最艰难的条件下，日丹诺夫曾采取一切办法来改变英雄城保卫者的严重状况。
    伟大的卫国战争胜利后，当共产党和苏联人民着手和平建设时，思想工作问题在党和国家的生活中就占了一个极重要的地位。作为马克思列宁主义的杰出理论家和天才宣传家，日丹诺夫作了一系列关于文学、艺术、哲学各种问题以及关于国际形势的报告。这些报告是马克思列宁主义理论发展中的重要贡献。这些报告有助于思想战线上的成就的宣传和缺点的克服，将苏联社会主义文化进一步发展的道路具体化了。日丹诺夫是一个善于将日常的社会主义建设工作和对马克思列宁主义理论问题的深刻研究结合起来的领导者的光辉榜样。
    日丹诺夫在关于列宁格勒“星”“列宁格勒”两杂志的极著名的报告中，揭发了存在于列宁格勒文学战线上的缺点和错误，号召苏联作家向新成就前进，写出具有高度思想性和高度艺术性的现实主义作品。这些作品要以绝对忠实于苏维埃祖国的精神，以共产主义的精神来教育苏联人民。
    日丹诺夫说：“苏联的作家和我们所有的思想工作者，目前正置身在最前线上，因为在和平发展的条件下，思想战线的任务，首先是文学的任务，不但没有降低，相反地，却更加重了。人民、国家和党要求文学不脱离现时生活，要求文学积极参加到苏联生活的一切方面去。”日丹诺夫指出，党中央委员会要求国家有丰富的精神文化，因为它在这种文化财富中，看出了社会主义的一个主要任务。
    日丹诺夫在一九四七年六月哲学讨论会上的演讲中，深刻阐明了随着马克思主义的发生，在哲学史上所完成的伟大的革命的变革，提供出哲学史对象的科学定义，并确立了马克思主义的哲学史的基本原理。日丹诺夫在这个演讲中对哲学工作中的客观主义和不问政治倾向作了尖锐的批评，斥责忽视现时的主题而在资产阶级哲学面前奴颜屈膝的态度。他号召哲学工作者要勇敢地开展批评和自我批评，从理论上来概括社会主义建设经验和现代自然科学的成就，并坚决地和资产阶级的唯心论作斗争。
    日丹诺夫指出：“从炮火的灰烬中生长出来了许多新民主主义国家和殖民地人民的民族解放运动。社会主义提到了各民族人民生活的日程上。除了我们，除了社会主义已经胜利的国家及其哲学家，还有谁能帮助我们国外的朋友兄弟用科学社会主义意识来照耀自己斗争的道路？除了我们，还有谁能够启发他们，用马克思主义的思想武器来武装他们？”
    日丹诺夫在一九四八年一月党中央委员会召开的苏联音乐工作者会议上的演讲中，阐明了苏联音乐的提高问题。他斥责那些忽视俄国古典音乐、俄国古典歌剧优良传统的苏联音乐家特有的形式主义倾向，同时说明了艺术中国际主义和民族主义问题。他着重指出：艺术中的国际主义不是在民族艺术削弱和贫乏的基础上产生的，只有在民族艺术繁荣的基础上才能产生国际主义，正和音乐中不是真正热爱自己祖国的人也就不能成为音乐中的国际主义者完全一样。
    安·亚·日丹诺夫是国际工人运动的巨大活动家之一。在加强全国革命工人和农民的联系的事业方面，在团结国际反帝国主义的民主阵营力量以反对新战争煽动者的事实方面，他的贡献是不可估量的。日丹诺夫在表明苏联的国际意义和国际威信的提高，表明它的伟大的进步作用时，强调指出：苏联是各族人民自由与独立的忠实拥护者，是任何一种民族和种族压迫、殖民地压迫的敌人。
    作为人民忠实的儿子，安·亚·日丹诺夫无限信任苏联人民的力量和才干，不倦地关怀着共产主义建设干部的培养和道德品质的高度发展。安德烈·亚历山德罗维奇·日丹诺夫贡献全部生命来为人民服务，为伟大的共产主义事业服务。他献出全部精力来完成党的任何委托。日丹诺夫是天才的列宁的忠实学生，伟大斯大林的战友，安·亚·日丹诺夫以其为苏维埃国家的幸福的积极活动，以其对共产党的无限忠实而博得党和苏联所有劳动人民的爱戴。日丹诺夫在正确地掌握马克思列宁主义思想方面，给予了苏联人民和其他国家人民许多的帮助。    （本报特约稿，章世鸿译）
