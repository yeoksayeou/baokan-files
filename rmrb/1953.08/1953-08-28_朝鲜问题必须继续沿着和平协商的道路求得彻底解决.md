    The Korean Question Must Continue to Seek a Thorough Solution Through Peaceful Consultation
    Hu Jin
    The Korean question is one of the major international issues left unresolved after World War II.

    Over the eight years since the war, the Korean question has undergone the following development process: initially, negotiations failed due to American obstruction, then the United States provoked a three-year war, and now it has returned to the path of peaceful resolution. This process concentrates the serious struggle between the two world camps implementing two different policies and routes after the war, vividly demonstrating the tremendous change in the balance of power between the two world camps after the war.

    President Eisenhower stated in his speech on April 16th this year: "Every nation has the inalienable right to establish its own form of government and economic system according to its own will." However, the US government after the war has not followed these principles in handling the Korean question, but precisely the opposite principles have dominated its policy. The reason why the Korean question has not been resolved through negotiation after the war lies here.

    It is known that the negotiated settlement of the Korean question after the war has a necessary basis. This basis is the agreement on Korea reached in the communiqué of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom in December 1945. This agreement, like other famous international agreements, if respected and fulfilled, could have peacefully resolved the Korean question. This would have been conducive to enhancing post-war international peace and cooperation.

    The Moscow Conference communiqué charged the US military representative in South Korea and the Soviet military representative in North Korea with jointly organizing a joint committee to consult with Korean democratic parties and social organizations to establish a provisional Korean democratic government on a democratic basis and to build Korea into an independent and democratic country.

    The Soviet Union faithfully fulfilled the obligations stipulated in this communiqué, assisted the Korean people in developing democratic undertakings in North Korea, and rapidly restored and developed the people's economic life. At the same time, the Soviet Union insisted in the Soviet-American Joint Committee that it must assist the Korean people in uniting various Korean democratic political parties and social organizations to establish their own government as soon as possible, and opposed any anti-people's democratic and divisive conspiracies in Korea.

    With the support of the Soviet Union, the Korean people, who had suffered the pain of prolonged rule by Japanese imperialism and waged unremitting and tenacious struggles, quickly and widely united to strive for the democracy, independence, and unification of their motherland. In August 1948, patriotic democrats representing the will of more than 85% of the electorate in North and South Korea elected the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea. In September of the same year, the Supreme People's Assembly adopted the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and established the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At the same time, all patriotic democratic political parties, social organizations, and the entire people of Korea struggled against all criminal acts of splitting the motherland. As early as April 1948, the joint conference of representatives of political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea expressed their willingness to peacefully unify the motherland. In June 1949, seventy-one patriotic political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea under the banner of the Fatherland Unification Front put forward the proposal to unify the motherland by peaceful means.

    At the request of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, the Soviet government completely withdrew the Soviet troops stationed in North Korea at the end of 1948, and demanded that the United States simultaneously withdraw its troops stationed in South Korea to ensure that the Korean people could establish their own government and achieve the independence of Korea without foreign interference.

    The above facts fully demonstrate that the Soviet Union faithfully fulfilled the agreement and respected the democratic and independent rights of the Korean people. After being liberated from the rule of Japanese imperialism and the traitors and feudal landlords colluding with it, the Korean people experienced a high tide of demand for democracy and independence, chose a people's democratic system, and demanded to unify the motherland in a peaceful and democratic way. This is also a reasonable and inevitable phenomenon.

    However, the US government does not consider fulfilling the obligations of an agreement it signed as a basic principle that a country should adhere to in handling international affairs. It has shown from beginning to end that it extremely rejects and opposes the democratic development and independent aspirations of the Korean people. Because the US government believes that the Moscow Conference agreement and the Korean people's democratic independence cause are completely incompatible with its post-war changed foreign policy, that is, the war policy of splitting the world and opposing the people.

    In fact, the plan put forward by the US government at the Moscow Conference began to expose its imperialist policy of attempting to implement in Korea. The US plan was to have the US and Soviet garrison authorities and the power institutions established by the four powers of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union administer and rule Korea within five to ten years. The United States did not consider the issue of establishing the Korean people's own government at all. Korean personnel could only participate in the unified power institutions composed of the US and Soviet garrison authorities as consultants, senators, and administrative personnel.

    At the Moscow Conference, the US government had to abandon its own plan and sign an agreement based on the Soviet plan. However, the delegation sent by the US government to work in the Soviet-American Joint Committee did not implement the Moscow Conference agreement, but still its own plan. It refused to consult with the democratic parties and social organizations in Korea, thus obstructing the establishment of a provisional Korean democratic government and paralyzing the work of the Soviet-American Joint Committee. The US delegation deliberately split Korea, supported the reactionary groups headed by the Syngman Rhee clique who opposed the Moscow agreement, arrested and persecuted members of democratic parties and social organizations in South Korea universities, maintained the dark forces such as traitors and landlord hooligans from the Japanese rule era, and held illegal so-called elections in South Korea in May 1948, establishing the notorious fascist rule of the Syngman Rhee clique.

    Only the US ruling group that extremely despises the independence, sovereignty, democracy and freedom of other countries' people dares to say that their brutal evil deeds in Korea are justified and that the Syngman Rhee's rogue rule is an "expression of the people's will". However, even the "United Nations Korean Commission" controlled and illegally organized by the United States had to admit in its report that this illegal election in South Korea was conducted under "fierce police terror". The Syngman Rhee puppet government was maintained by reactionary fascist rule. In 1949 alone, 118,621 people were arrested in South Korea. The Syngman Rhee clique's greedy and corrupt plundering caused the bankruptcy of the South Korean economy. The South Korean people, who were hungry, poor, lacking land, deprived of democratic rights, and oppressed, widely launched guerrilla warfare, which eventually developed into a national struggle against the reactionary Syngman Rhee clique.

    The US government's policy of splitting Korea and supporting the Syngman Rhee's reactionary rule is part of its overall policy of preparing to provoke a new world war and attempting to dominate the Far East and the world after the war. Just like the conspiracies carried out in other regions, the US government in Korea also attempted to use the division of Korea and, through the Syngman Rhee clique, to prepare and launch a war of aggression against Korea, China, and other regions in the Far East.

    In order to achieve this sinister goal, the US government repeatedly rejected the Soviet government and Korean people's proposals for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea in September 1947 and September 1948. Until July 1949, when the United States had to withdraw its troops stationed in South Korea under the pressure of Korea and the world's people, it still left behind a "expanded Korean Military Advisory Group" led by former US Commander of the South Korean Military, Brigadier General Roberts, and carried out a large-scale military "Aid to Korea plan". Former US President Truman openly declared that he would turn South Korea into an "anti-communist testing ground" and a springboard for launching a war of aggression.

    Under the wings and support of the United States, the Syngman Rhee clique repeatedly rejected the Korean people's proposals for unifying Korea in a peaceful and democratic way, mobilized all the resources and finances of South Korea to engage in war preparations, and carried out endless military provocations against North Korea. One month before the Syngman Rhee clique launched an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Johnson, director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration's Korean branch, told the US Congress Appropriations Committee that the 100,000 South Korean troops equipped with US weapons and trained by the US military advisory group had completed preparations and could start operations at any time. General Roberts had issued orders to the officials of the Syngman Rhee clique as early as January 1950, saying: "The plan for the Northern Expedition has been decided. The implementation of this plan is not far away."

    As a result, the United States finally embarked on the road of military adventure. The United States launched a war of armed intervention in Korea, blocking the path for the Korean people to peacefully unify their motherland. This military adventure by the United States is a most brutal act of undermining international good faith, independent rights, and world peace, a most vicious attack on the "policy of strength" of resolving international problems by force, and a most frantic infringement on the world's peace and democratic camp.

    However, now, this military adventure policy of the United States has failed. The United States has had to return to the path of peace to negotiate a resolution to the Korean question.

    This is a just judgment of history.

    This is not accidental at all.

    This struggle surrounding the Korean question since World War II proves that: the world peace and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union is incredibly powerful and inviolable; any "policy of strength" that attempts to solve international problems by force and any acts of aggression that arrogantly obliterate and damage the independence, sovereignty and peace of other countries can be defeated; therefore, people's efforts to establish peaceful cooperative relations between countries, especially major powers, to strengthen organizations conducive to international peace and security, such as the United Nations, and to strive to resolve disputes and ease international tensions through negotiation are possible.

    However, the peaceful resolution of the Korean question in the future is still a serious struggle. This struggle will still be a struggle between two lines.

    According to Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement, in order to ensure the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, a political conference will be held within three months after the signing and entry into force of the Armistice Agreement to negotiate issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

    Therefore, the peaceful resolution of the Korean question still boils down to unifying Korea on a peaceful and democratic basis, without foreign interference, and the national independence and sovereignty of the Korean people must not be infringed upon. The solution to this issue now rests with the political conference.

    There is no doubt that the Chinese and Korean side, the Soviet Union, other people's democratic countries, and all peace-loving people around the world consistently adhere to this position and resolutely support the political conference in completing this task.

    However, there are already many facts proving that the US government still adopts a completely opposite attitude.

    Before the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, the US government announced that it would sign a "Common Security Treaty" with the Syngman Rhee clique. This treaty stipulates that the United States will station naval, land, and air forces "on the territory of South Korea and near the territory of South Korea." Now this treaty has been signed by Dulles and Syngman Rhee.

    This shows that the United States is still unwilling to withdraw its troops from Korea and stipulates in the treaty that US troops will remain in Korea. This is even more arrogant than its actions after World War II.

    At the same time, Dulles and Syngman Rhee jointly set a deadline for the political conference, saying that they would withdraw from the meeting if it exceeded ninety days or was less than that time, as long as they deemed it necessary. Dulles also pressured the fifteen countries that sent troops to invade Korea to pass a "declaration" in an attempt to drive them to resume the war of aggression against Korea if the Korean armistice was violated.

    This is not only a naked conspiracy by the United States to undermine the political conference, but also an arrangement for it to further undermine peace in Korea.

    Precisely for this despicable purpose, the US delegation at the resumed United Nations General Assembly recently undisguisedly attempted to continue to use the United Nations as an enemy of the political conference, opposing the participation of relevant countries other than the armistice parties in the political conference, so that the United States could easily undermine the political conference together with Syngman Rhee and use the United Nations as a tool to undermine the political conference and carry out new adventures.

    As long as people link the various conspiracies and tricks currently being carried out by the United States with its previous policy of obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean question and creating the Korean War, it is not difficult to judge that the arrogant adventurers in the United States are not reconciled.

    Therefore, this new conspiracy of the American aggressors must be defeated. The Korean question must continue to move forward along the path of peaceful consultation in order to achieve a thorough solution. This is the urgent task at hand.

    朝鲜问题必须继续沿着和平协商的道路求得彻底解决
    胡今
    朝鲜问题是第二次世界大战以后许多悬而未决的重大国际问题之一。
    战后八年多来，朝鲜问题经历了这样的发展过程：最初由于美国的阻挠而使协商归于失败，接着美国便挑起了为时三年的战争，现在才又重新回到和平解决的道路上来。这个过程，集中地表现了战后两个世界阵营实行两个不同政策与路线的严重斗争，生动地显示了战后两个世界阵营之间力量对比的巨大变化。
    艾森豪威尔总统在今年四月十六日的演说中表示：“每一国家都有按照自己的意愿来建立政府形式和经济制度的权利，这种权利是不容剥夺的”。然而，战后美国政府在处理朝鲜问题上所遵循的并不是这些原则，而恰是截然相反的原则支配着它的政策。战后朝鲜问题所以未能协商解决的原因，也就在这里。
    人们知道，战后朝鲜问题的协商解决，是具有必要的基础的。这个基础就是一九四五年十二月莫斯科苏美英三国外长会议公报中所达成的关于朝鲜的协议。这个协议，正如其他著名的国际协定一样，如果得到尊重和履行，朝鲜问题是能够和平解决的。这是有利于战后国际和平合作关系的增进的。
    莫斯科会议公报中，责成驻南朝鲜的美国军事代表和驻北朝鲜的苏联军事代表共同组织联合委员会，咨询朝鲜各民主党派与社会团体，在民主基础上建立临时朝鲜民主政府，建设朝鲜成为一个独立的民主国家。
    苏联忠实地履行了这个公报中所规定的义务，在北朝鲜协助朝鲜人民发展民主事业，迅速恢复和发展了人民的经济生活。同时，苏联在苏美联合委员会中坚持必须协助朝鲜人民联合各朝鲜民主政党和社会团体及早建立他们自己的政府，反对任何反人民民主的、分裂朝鲜的阴谋活动。
    在苏联的支持下，饱尝日本帝国主义长期统治的痛苦而进行了不懈的顽强斗争的朝鲜人民，迅速地广泛地团结起来，争取祖国的民主、独立和统一。一九四八年八月，代表南北朝鲜百分之八十五以上选举人的意志的爱国民主人士选举了朝鲜最高人民会议，同年九月，最高人民会议通过了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法，建立了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府。同时，朝鲜所有的爱国民主政党、社会团体和全体人民，向一切分裂祖国的罪恶行为进行斗争。早在一九四八年四月，南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体代表的联席会议，即表示了和平统一祖国的意愿。一九四九年六月，祖国统一战线旗帜下的南北朝鲜七十一个爱国政党和社会团体，又提出用和平方法统一祖国的主张。
    苏联政府应朝鲜最高人民会议的请求，在一九四八年底，全部撤退了留驻北朝鲜的苏联军队，并要求美国同时撤退其驻南朝鲜的军队，以保证朝鲜人民不受外力干涉而由他们建立自己的政府并实现朝鲜的独立。
    以上事实，充分表明苏联是忠实地履行协议，尊重朝鲜人民的民主与独立权利的。朝鲜人民从日本帝国主义和与之相勾结的卖国贼、封建地主阶级的统治下解放出来后，出现了要求民主与独立的高潮，选择了人民民主制度，并要求以和平民主方式统一祖国，这也是合情合理的必然现象。
    然而，美国政府并不认为履行自己签了字的协议的义务是一个国家处理国际事务中应有的起码准则。它自始至终表现了它是极端排斥和敌视朝鲜人民的民主发展与独立愿望的。因为美国政府认为莫斯科会议的协议和朝鲜人民的民主独立事业，已经和它战后改变了的外交政策，亦即分裂世界的、反人民的战争政策，完全不能相容了。
    其实，美国政府向莫斯科会议提出的计划，就开始暴露了它企图在朝鲜推行的帝国主义政策。美国计划是要在五年至十年内由美苏驻军当局和由美、中、英、苏四强建立政权机构，来管制和统治朝鲜。美国根本没有考虑到建立朝鲜人民自己的政府问题，朝鲜人士仅能以顾问、参议及行政人员的资格参加美苏驻军当局组成的统一政权机构。
    在莫斯科会议中，美国政府不得不放弃了自己的计划，订立了以苏联计划为基础而拟订的协议。但是，美国政府派在苏美联合委员会工作的代表团，执行的不是莫斯科会议的协议，而仍然是美国自己的方案，它拒绝与朝鲜的民主党派与社会团体协商，因而阻挠了临时朝鲜民主政府的建立，使苏美联合委员会的工作陷于瘫痪。美国代表团蓄意分裂朝鲜，扶植以李承晚集团为首的反对莫斯科协议的各反动集团，在南朝鲜大学逮捕和迫害民主党派和社会团体成员，保持日本统治时代的卖国贼和地主流氓等黑暗势力，并在一九四八年五月举行非法的南朝鲜的所谓选举，建立了臭名昭著的李承晚集团的法西斯统治。
    只有极端蔑视别国人民的独立主权与民主自由的美国统治集团，才胆敢把它们在朝鲜的这个粗暴的恶行说成是正当的，把李承晚的恶棍统治说成是“人民意志的表示”。但是，连美国一手控制和非法组织的“联合国朝鲜委员会”也在报告中不得不承认：这次南朝鲜的非法选举，是在“凶恶的警察恐怖”下进行的。李承晚傀儡政府是靠反动的法西斯统治而加以维持的，仅在一九四九年南朝鲜就有十一万八千六百二十一人被捕，李承晚集团贪婪与腐败的搜括造成了南朝鲜经济的破产。陷于饥饿、贫穷、缺乏土地和被剥夺了民主权利、遭受压迫的南朝鲜人民，广泛地发动了游击战争，最后发展成了对反动的李承晚集团的全民斗争。
    美国政府分裂朝鲜和扶植李承晚反动统治的政策，是它战后准备挑起新的世界大战，企图称霸远东和世界的总政策的一部分。正和在其他地区所进行的阴谋一样，美国政府在朝鲜也企图利用朝鲜的分裂，并通过李承晚集团，来准备和发动侵略朝鲜、中国和远东其他地区的战争。
    为了实现这个罪恶的目的，美国政府在一九四七年九月和一九四八年九月，一再拒绝苏联政府和朝鲜人民关于美军撤离南朝鲜的建议。直至一九四九年七月美国不得不在朝鲜和世界人民的压力下撤退驻南朝鲜的军队后，仍留下由前美国驻南朝鲜军司令罗伯兹准将率领的“范围扩大的朝鲜军事顾问团”，并进行大规模的军事“援韩计划”。前美国总统杜鲁门曾公开声称要把南朝鲜变成“反共的试验场”，发动侵略战争的跳板。
    在美国的卵翼和支持下，李承晚集团一再拒绝了朝鲜人民要求以和平民主方式统一朝鲜的建议，动员南朝鲜的一切资源和财力从事战争准备，并向北朝鲜进行无休止的军事挑衅。在李承晚集团发动进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国之前一个月，美国“经济合作总署”朝鲜分署署长琼逊对美国国会拨款委员会说：以美国武器装备并由美国军事顾问团训练的十万名南朝鲜军队，已经完成准备，并能随时开始作战。罗伯兹将军更早在一九五○年一月就对李承晚集团各长官发布命令说：“北伐的计划已经决定。这个计划的实施已经为期不远了。”
    于是，美国终于走上了军事冒险的道路。美国发动了武装干涉朝鲜的战争，阻断了朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的道路。美国这个军事冒险行动，是一种对国际信义、独立权利和世界和平的最粗暴的破坏行为，是以武力解决国际问题的“实力政策”的一次最恶毒的进攻，是对世界和平民主阵营的最疯狂的侵犯。
    然而，现在，美国这个军事冒险政策失败了。美国不得不重新回到和平的轨道上来协商解决朝鲜问题了。
    这是历史的公正裁判。
    这完全不是偶然的。
    第二次世界大战以来围绕朝鲜问题的这一斗争过程证明了：以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营是无比强大的、侵犯不得的；任何企图以武力解决国际问题的“实力政策”，横暴地抹煞与损害别国的独立主权与和平安全的侵略行为，都是可以被打败的；因而人们争取建立各国特别是大国之间的和平合作关系，加强有利于国际和平与安全的组织如联合国之类的组织，争取以协商方式解决争端缓和国际紧张局势，是可能实现的。
    但是，今后朝鲜问题的和平解决，仍是一场严重的斗争。这个斗争，仍将是两条路线的斗争。
    根据停战协定第六十款的规定，为保证朝鲜问题的和平解决，将在停战协定签字并生效后的三个月内召开政治会议，协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题等问题。
    因此，朝鲜问题的和平解决，依然是归结到在和平民主基础上统一朝鲜，不受外力的干涉，朝鲜人民的民族独立主权不容侵犯的问题。这个问题的解决，现在落在政治会议的身上了。
    毫无疑问，中朝一方、苏联及其他人民民主国家以及全世界爱好和平人士一贯坚持这样的主张，并坚决支持政治会议完成这个任务。
    可是，现在就已有种种事实证明：美国政府仍然采取了另一种截然相反的态度。
    在朝鲜停战协定还没有签订之前，美国政府就宣布要和李承晚集团签订“共同安全条约”，这个条约规定美国“在南朝鲜的领土上和靠近南朝鲜的领土上”驻扎海陆空武装力量。现在这个条约已由杜勒斯和李承晚签订了。
    这表明了，美国依然不愿从朝鲜撤退军队，并以条约规定美军要留驻朝鲜。这比它在第二次世界大战后的做法是更为横暴了。
    同时，杜勒斯和李承晚共同给政治会议规定了一个期限，说什么超过九十天或不到这个时间，他们只要认为必要时就退出会议。杜勒斯还压迫出兵侵朝的十五国通过一个“宣言”，企图驱使它们在朝鲜停战遭到破坏时恢复侵朝战争。
    这不仅是美国破坏政治会议的露骨的预谋，而且是为它进一步破坏朝鲜和平作了布置了。
    正是为了这个卑鄙的目的，美国代表团在日前复会的联合国大会上，毫无掩饰地企图继续把联合国作为政治会议的敌对一方，反对政治会议有停战双方以外的有关国家参加，以便美国很容易和李承晚一起破坏政治会议，并利用联合国作为破坏政治会议和进行新的冒险的工具。
    人们只要把目前美国所进行的种种阴谋诡计来和以前它阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决并制造了朝鲜战争的政策联在一起看，就不难判断：美国狂妄的冒险家们还不甘休哩。
    因此，必须击败美国侵略者的这个新的预谋。必须使朝鲜问题沿着和平协商的道路继续前进，以求得彻底的解决。这是当前的迫切任务。
