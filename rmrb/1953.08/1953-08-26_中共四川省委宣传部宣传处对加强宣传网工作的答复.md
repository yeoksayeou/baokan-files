    The Propaganda Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Reply on Strengthening Propaganda Network Work
    The Propaganda Section of the Propaganda Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party wrote: The July 13th "Reader's Letters Summary" column published reader Liu Jiu's criticism of the lack of leadership from the Propaganda Department of the Longchang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Sichuan Province regarding propaganda network work. We have informed the Longchang County Committee's Propaganda Department to investigate this issue. Recently, the Southwest Bureau's Propaganda Department convened a meeting of the heads of propaganda sections of the provincial and municipal committees' propaganda departments, specifically to discuss propaganda network work. The meeting researched the situation of many localities relaxing leadership over propaganda network work and lacking leadership methods, and put forward opinions on how to improve and strengthen this work in the future. The Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department is now transmitting and implementing the spirit and content of the Southwest Propaganda Conference in a step-by-step manner. Various localities have paid attention to consolidating and improving propaganda network work during the spring plowing production and general election work. This work should have new progress in the future.

    中共四川省委宣传部宣传处对加强宣传网工作的答复
    中共四川省委宣传部宣传处来信：七月十三日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了读者刘九对中共四川隆昌县委宣传部对宣传网工作缺乏领导问题的批评。我们已转告隆昌县委宣传部对这个问题进行检查。最近西南局宣传部召开了各省、市委宣传部宣传处长会议，专门讨论了宣传网工作，对许多地方放松对宣传网工作的领导以及缺乏领导办法的情况作了研究，并提出了今后如何改进和加强这一工作的意见。现在省委宣传部正在有步骤地传达和贯彻西南宣传会议的精神和内容。各地在春耕生产和普选工作中已注意了巩固和提高宣传网工作，今后这个工作当会有新的进展。
