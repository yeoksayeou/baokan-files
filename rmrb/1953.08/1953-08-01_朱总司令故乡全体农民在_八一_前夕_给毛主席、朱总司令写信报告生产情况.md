All Farmers in Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's Hometown Write to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu Reporting on Production Status on the Eve of "August 1st"

The farmers of Ma'an Township, Yilong County, Sichuan Province—the hometown of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De—wrote a letter to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, reporting on their production and living conditions over the past year. The full text is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

This past year, our Ma'an Township has changed again. Last year, we made a guarantee to you to "produce more grain to support the country's economic construction," and now it has been realized. Both the spring and winter harvests increased by 10% to 15% compared to the year before. This year, everyone is even more enthusiastic. The fields in our township have never been fertilized at the bottom before, but this year, not only was bottom fertilizer universally applied, but also an additional top dressing was applied. The People's Government, fearing that our fertilizer would not be enough, also lent us 30 million yuan to buy more than 7,000 kilograms of ammonium sulfate. This year, 80% of the fields in the township are using the new method of sparse seedlings and dense planting. The more than 20 mu of land in the Wang Xianzhe Mutual Aid Team in the Fourth Village had an average of 9,000 to 10,000 seedlings per mu this year. The seedlings grew large, and the ears of grain were also longer than in previous years. Everyone measured the ears of grain, weighed the grains, and calculated that the average yield per mu would be 800 to 900 jin.

Our lives are better than last year. From the time the spring harvest came down to now, the farmers in our township have never stopped depositing money in the bank. At its peak, deposits reached more than 40 million yuan, and even during the lean season, it never fell below 10 million yuan.

The farmers in our township all care about the production and lives of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel. Last year, the fields that everyone contracted and helped cultivate for 60 families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel increased by 17% compared to the previous year, and this year it is estimated that it will increase by another 20% compared to last year. During festivals, every family does not forget to comfort the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, and at ordinary times, they have never let the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel lack rice or firewood. Now, there are still more than 20 days before the autumn harvest, and each village has already made plans to help the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel with the autumn harvest. Many mutual aid teams have included in their plans: ensuring "contracted harvesting, contracted threshing, and delivery to the granary" and "plowing while threshing."

We also want to tell you a great happy event. Our Ma'an Township has begun general elections. Everyone is determined to elect their own representatives in the general elections to consolidate their own political power. As soon as the general election began, everyone automatically established 64 noontime schools, using the midday break to study the election law. We did not allow a single bad element to steal the right to vote. Now we have already nominated our representative candidates. These people are the most steadfast in the struggle against the enemy, have braved wind and rain for many years, and are loyal and active good farmers and good cadres. These days, everyone is happily preparing to celebrate "August 1st", welcome the election, and prepare for the autumn harvest.

Respected Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: We know that the country's economic construction has only just begun, and better days are yet to come. We guarantee that under your leadership, we will continue to do a good job in production and support the country's great construction. We wish you good health.

All farmers of Ma'an Township, Yilong County, Sichuan Province.
July 27th

    朱总司令故乡全体农民在“八一”前夕
    给毛主席、朱总司令写信报告生产情况
    朱总司令的故乡——四川省仪陇县马鞍乡的全体农民，在“八一”建军节前夕写信给毛主席、朱总司令，报告他们一年来的生产和生活情况，全文如下：敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    这一年来，我们马鞍乡又变了一个样。去年，我们向您们提出“多打粮食，支援祖国经济建设”的保证，现在已经实现了。大春、小春都比前年增产了一成到一成半。今年大家更起劲。我们乡上的田从来没上过底肥，今年不但普遍上了底肥，还多施了一道追肥。人民政府怕我们的肥料不够，还借给我们三千万元买了七千多斤硫酸錏。今年全乡百分之八十的田是用的少秧密栽的新方法。四村王贤者互助组的二十多亩田，今年平均每亩栽了九千到一万窝，秧窝发的大，谷穗也比往年长，大家量谷穗、称谷粒，算下来平均每亩要打八、九百斤。
    我们的生活比起去年更好了。从今年小春打下来到现在，我们乡上的农民在银行里没断过存款，多的时候存到过四千多万元，青黄不接的时候也没少过一千万元。
    咱乡的农民人人都关心烈属、军属的生产和生活。去年，大家给六十户烈属、军属包耕和帮工的田，都比前年增产了一成七，今年估计比去年还要增产二成。逢年过节，家家都不忘慰问烈属和军属，平时也从未让烈属和军属家里缺过米，少过柴。现在离秋收还有二十多天，各村就都已订了帮助烈属、军属收秋的计划。有不少互助组在计划里都订着：保证做到“包收包打包入仓”和“边打边耕”。
    我们还要告诉您们一件大喜事。我们马鞍乡开始普选了。大家都决心在普选中选好自己的代表，巩固自己的政权。普选一开始，大家自动成立了六十四所午校，利用晌午歇凉的时候学习选举法。我们没让一个坏分子窃取了选举权。现在我们已经把我们的代表候选人提出来了。这些人都是多年来对敌人斗争最坚强、风里来雨里去、忠实积极的好农民和好干部。这些天，大家都欢天喜地地准备庆祝“八一”，迎接选举，准备秋收。
    敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：我们知道，国家经济建设才开始，更好的日子还在后面。我们保证在您们的领导下，继续搞好生产，支援祖国的大建设。祝您们身体健康
    四川省仪陇县马鞍乡全体农民上
    七月二十七日
