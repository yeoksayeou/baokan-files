Township Head Dong Huizhen of Baige Township, Chengnan District, Zhucheng County, Shandong Province, is fifty years old this year. He suffered greatly since childhood. When the Japanese devils occupied Zhucheng, his family of five went without cotton clothes for four years. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the farmers of Baige Township launched various social reform movements, and Dong Huizhen was very active in his performance. Soon, he was elected chairman of the village farmers' association, and in April 1946, he joined the Chinese Communist Party. Under the education of the Party, he worked even more actively, and was later elected secretary of the Liugou Village Branch, actively leading the masses to struggle against bullies and landlords, reclaiming more than 650 mu of land. In distributing the fruits of the struggle, Dong Huizhen put the masses first and himself second, and tried his best to eliminate the concerns of the masses. For example, at that time, poor peasant Wang Laifu was afraid of "the sky changing" and dared not take the land, so Dong Huizhen exchanged his good land for him. In the spring of 1946, Dong Huizhen had financial difficulties, and his family often had no food to eat, but he still worked actively, standing guard day and night, watching over the landlords, and persisting in the struggle. Bad elements tried many times to win him over, but because of his firm stance, he did not waver in the slightest. Therefore, he once gained the love and support of the broad masses, and in 1950 he was elected deputy township head.

However, due to the bureaucratic style of leadership at the county and district levels, the distribution of work was not based on the actual situation, and numbers were blindly assigned with deadlines for completion. When summarizing and inspecting work, the way in which tasks were completed was ignored, and only cadres who used coercion and command to "complete tasks" were praised. Dong Huizhen mistakenly believed that the masses were backward and could not accomplish anything without coercion; regardless of how it was done, as long as the task was completed, the superiors would be happy. As a result, he developed a serious style of coercion and command in his work and gradually became detached from the masses. Last spring, the district committee assigned the task of planting cotton, and Baige Township was assigned 1,010 mu. The township then assigned the numbers to each village. The task of Liugou Village was 50.04 mu. Dong Huizhen asked everyone to "volunteer" at the villagers' meeting, but because they were not accustomed to growing cotton and the masses did not understand why they should grow cotton, no one was willing to volunteer. He became angry and shouted loudly, "Cotton can be used to make bullets, and growing cotton is supporting the resistance against the United States and aiding Korea. If you don't report the numbers, how can I hand in the task to the district? If you don't report all of it tonight, the meeting won't be dismissed tomorrow morning. Even if there's only one mu, you have to plant three fen." After speaking, he stood on the table and "called names" from house to house until everyone agreed. Later, because farmer Jiao Zhenlu of the township had objections to planting cotton and was not active in pest control, Dong Huizhen pointed at his head and said, "If you don't control the cotton pests, you are not actively resisting the United States and aiding Korea; I give you two days to cure it, and if you don't cure it, I'll treat you as a bad egg and struggle against you." Because the masses were not enthusiastic about planting cotton and lacked technical guidance, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu of the 1,010 mu planted in the township was less than 30 jin, which was equivalent to a loss of more than 60,000 jin of grain. Some of the masses made up a ballad about Dong Huizhen: "Dong's (referring to Dong Huizhen) work is really rigid, assigning numbers, labeling, and calling names; if they say you're a donkey, you have to admit it, if they tell you to go fast, you don't dare stop."

Once, when the village held a women's meeting, not everyone arrived. He went on the radio and yelled, "Women who can move, get out here to the meeting right away, and old stubborn three-legged people (meaning elderly people with crutches) stay home and watch the door." As soon as he shouted this, everyone immediately arrived. If any family had domestic troubles or neighborhood disputes, as soon as Dong Huizhen arrived, there would be no more noise. The masses said, "No matter how big or small the matter is, once 'Dong's' arrives, no one dares disobey." Everyone generally commented: Now "Dong's" ears are filled with "beeswax" and he can't hear the affairs of the masses.

After the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline was launched this year, Dong Huizhen underwent a fierce ideological struggle. At first, he thought: Although coercion is not right, the superiors' "tasks" were all "completed"; he was afraid that the superiors would not see his achievements and kick him away, "killing the donkey to eat after finishing the grinding," regretting doing a lot of work and getting a bad reputation, feeling that he had a grievance he couldn't express. Later, he worried again: Even if the superiors don't "kick" me, I'm afraid the masses won't want me anymore, and it would be too embarrassing to really step down. At the same time, even if I continue to work, how can I complete the task without coercion? It will be difficult to work in the future. The "three roads" fought back and forth in Dong Huizhen's mind, and he didn't know which road to take. "Go to the Northeast" what to do there? The future is completely ruined, and at the same time, it would be even more troublesome if the superiors found out and called him back; "die"! All the years of "hard work" are over at once, and at the same time, a Communist Party member should not do this; "transform"! How to transform? He tossed and turned, unable to sleep for five nights, and carried a heavy ideological burden.

On January 10th of this year, Zhucheng County convened the ninth first session (exercising the functions of the People's Congress) of the People's Representatives from all walks of life. The representatives made many comments on the work of the government at the meeting, and County Head Li made a profound self-criticism item by item, and expressed that he would resolutely correct them in the future. This was warmly welcomed by the representatives, and they unanimously elected him to continue to be the county head. Shi Wensheng, a cadre of Wangyuan Village in the tenth district, was repeatedly unrepentant of raping women and extorting money. The representatives unanimously opposed him, and as a result, Shi Wensheng was sentenced to one and a half years in prison. Dong Huizhen's thinking began to open up at this meeting. He thought: County heads can also make self-criticisms and corrections when they make mistakes, and they are not afraid of losing face; why can't I make self-criticisms and corrections? If I continue to develop, wouldn't I be taking Shi Wensheng's road? So he made up his mind to change his style.

In the struggle against bureaucracy, the district committee also conducted an in-depth examination of the shortcomings in leadership, and analyzed that Dong Huizhen's coercion and command were inseparable from the district committee's bureaucracy. This further eliminated Dong Huizhen's concerns, and he began to repeatedly criticize the reasons for his past commandism at branch meetings, people's representative meetings, and mass meetings. He mistakenly thought that the masses were backward and would not leave if they were not driven; he only knew how to complete the numbers and report the achievements to the superiors, but he did not know that many good things were ruined and he was separated from the masses. Moreover, he should not have forgotten that he was oppressed by the landlords in the past, and today he has turned over and is ruling the people. Finally, he expressed his determination to correct his mistakes, discuss matters with everyone, and never commit coercion and command again. He made repeated criticisms in this way in large and small meetings seven times, and the masses also sincerely and severely criticized him. At the same time, the masses also believed that Dong Huizhen was active in his work, had a firm stance, was selfless, and could endure hardship, but his style of coercion and command was too serious. As long as he can correct it in the future, he can continue to do things for everyone. These opinions completely dispelled Dong Huizhen's concerns that the masses would not see his past achievements. He deeply realized that if he made mistakes, he should correct them as soon as possible, and the masses would forgive him. If he worked hard in the future, he would also gain the support of the masses. After that, he made up his mind to correct his mistakes with practical actions and was determined to do good things for the masses. This spring, Baige Township suffered a severe spring famine, and many people lost confidence in self-salvation. Some planned to flee famine outside, and some simply waited for government relief. Seeing this serious situation, Dong Huizhen organized township and village cadres to visit each village and household to understand the disaster situation, carried out mutual borrowing and mutual assistance through mutual aid teams, and he personally helped Zhang Qi to formulate a production self-rescue plan, which was introduced at the mass meeting, widely organized production self-rescue, and overcame the spring famine. In the movement to implement the Marriage Law, Dong Huizhen's wife wanted to interfere in the marriage of her daughter Dong Aimei, which aroused some dissatisfaction among the masses. Dong Huizhen patiently persuaded her and supported her daughter's marriage autonomy, which promoted the implementation of the Marriage Law in the township. The masses generally reflected: Dong Huizhen has become better, the beeswax in his ears has melted, and he is communicating with the masses. At this year's township people's representative meeting, Dong Huizhen was elected township head.

Since becoming township head, Dong Huizhen has changed his past style of coercion and command. Under the unified leadership of the township general branch, he personally took charge of a mutual aid team. He found that there was a general tendency among the team members to think that "wet ground won't be late," which affected the spring plowing. Based on the experience and lessons learned from the farmers of Baige Village last year, who waited and planted late for two days, resulting in more than 800 mu of land being replanted twice, wasting effort and producing less grain, he compared the accounts among the team members to make everyone realize that deep plowing, multiple harrowing, and timely sowing can increase production, and helped everyone to make a spring plowing and spring planting plan. Dong Huizhen also personally led everyone to expand the mutual aid organization, bought a working ox together, sorted out the methods of calculating work points, and planned to break the boundaries of households for plowing to solve the difficulty of insufficient working cattle, and made appropriate division of labor for the labor force in the group, and inspected and repaired agricultural tools. All the women in the group went down the slope to weed the wheat, and finished weeding once in two days. The 60 mu of spring land was plowed in six days, and the sorghum sowing was completed in two days. In the spring plowing production, Dong Huizhen timely promoted the experience of this group to the whole township, which greatly improved the ideological awareness and production enthusiasm of the farmers. All 4,210 mu of spring land in the township were sown before "Grain Rain," three days earlier than other townships. At the same time, 0.8 carts of fertilizer per mu were added compared with last year, and most farmers used underground insecticides, laying a good foundation for increasing production throughout the year. Dong Huizhen also promoted the experience of Jiang Yantian, a production expert, in using the method of two crops a year to increase corn production, and the area of corn planting in the township increased from 246 mu last year to 425 mu, laying the foundation for promoting the method of two crops a year. The farmers in the township were not very accustomed to using chemical fertilizers, so Dong Huizhen first bought 30 jin and applied it to his 1.4 mu of millet for a test. After five days, the millet changed its appearance, so he summoned the leaders of the labor exchange teams and the masses to visit and sold 210 jin on the spot. Before the wheat was harvested, Comrade Dong Huizhen thought: The "438" wheat variety is indeed good, but how can it be promoted? He then invited labor models and the leaders of the labor exchange teams to study in his own field. By counting wheat grains, comparing quality, and calculating yield, they proved that "438" wheat planted on the same land could produce 48 jin more per mu than the local wheat. Then, he summoned a large number of farmers to visit the field, and as a result, all 850 jin of "438" wheat were exchanged in two days.

With the change in Dong Huizhen's style, the work of Baige Township has entered a new stage. The masses generally feel: This year is very different from previous years. Comrade Dong Huizhen also realized that his previous working methods were: "coercion, piling up evenly, and hard灌输," and this spring he was able to do a good job and gain the support of the masses mainly because he achieved: "lead by doing, teach personally, and explain thoroughly."

    乡长董会祯重新得到群众的拥护
    李波  燕青
    山东诸城县城南区柏戈乡乡长董会祯，今年五十岁。他从小就受苦。日寇占领诸城时，全家五口人四年没穿上棉衣。解放后，柏戈乡的农民在共产党领导下，开展了各种社会改革运动，董会祯表现非常积极。不久，他被选为村农会会长，一九四六年四月加入了中国共产党。在党的教育下，他工作更加积极了，以后又被选为柳沟村支部书记，积极领导了群众向恶霸、地主进行斗争，算回土地六百五十余亩。在分配斗争果实时，董会祯先群众，后自己，并竭力消除了群众顾虑。如当时贫农王来福怕“变天”不敢要地，董会祯便把自己的好地换给他。一九四六年春天，董会祯生活困难，家里经常没有饭吃，但他依然积极工作，日以继夜地站岗放哨，看管地主，坚持斗争，坏分子多次想设法拉拢收买他，由于他立场坚定，丝毫没有动摇，因而曾得到了广大群众的爱戴和拥护，一九五○年被选为副乡长。
    但是由于县、区领导上存在着官僚主义，布置工作时，不根据实际情况，盲目分配数字，限期完成；总结和检查工作时，也不管完成任务的方式方法，只表扬强迫命令“完成任务”的干部。董会祯也就错误地认为：群众落后，不强迫办不成事；不管如何，只要完成任务上级就高兴，因而在工作中产生了严重的强迫命令作风，渐渐脱离了群众。去年春天，区委布置种棉花，柏戈乡分配了一千零十亩的任务，乡里又按数分配给各村。柳沟村的任务是五十亩零四分，董会祯在村民大会上要大家“自报”，但因没有种棉习惯，群众不明白为什么种棉，所以谁都不愿报。他便发火了，高声嚷叫说：“棉花能造子弹，种棉就是抗美援朝，你们不报数，我怎样上区交任务？今晚报不齐，天明不散会，有一亩就得种三分。”说完就站在桌子上挨户“点名”，直到都答应了才算完事。后来，该乡农民焦振路因对种棉有意见，治虫不积极，董会祯指着他的头皮说：“你不治棉花虫，就是对抗美援朝不积极；限你两天治好，治不好就当坏蛋斗你。”由于群众种棉情绪不高，又缺乏技术指导，因此，全乡种的一千零十亩棉花，每亩产量平均籽棉不足三十斤，等于损失粮食六万余斤。有些群众给董会祯编了这样的一首歌谣：“董家（指董会祯）工作真生硬，派数、扣帽和点名；说你是驴得认下，叫你快走不敢停。”
    有一次，村里召开妇女会，人没到齐，他上了广播台吆呼：“能动弹的妇女赶快给我出来开会，三条腿的老顽固（意思是扶拐杖的老年人）在家看门。”他这一喊人马上就到齐了。谁家如果闹家务或街坊争吵，只要董会祯一到，就没有动静了。群众说：“事大事小‘董家’一到不敢不了。”大家普遍议论：如今“董家”耳朵灌上了“蜂蜡”，听不到群众的事了。
    今年反对官僚主义、命令主义、违法乱纪斗争开展后，董会祯在思想上起了激烈的斗争。起初，他认为：强迫虽然不对，但上级的“任务”都“完成”了；怕上级看不见他的成绩把他一脚踢开，“推完磨来杀驴吃”，后悔干了一顿工作，落了一腚不是，觉得有苦说不出。后来，他又顾虑：上级不“踢”我，也怕群众不能要我了，真的下了台多丢脸。同时，即便再干下去，不强迫那能完成任务呢？今后工作不好干了。“三条路”在董会祯的脑子里反来覆去的斗争起来，不知走那条路好。“下关东”吧，到那里怎么办？前途完全完蛋了，同时如果叫上级查着了再找回来更麻烦；“死掉”吧！多年的“苦劳”一下子完了，同时，共产党员更不应该这样作；“转变”吧！怎样转呢？他翻来复去，五晚上没睡着觉，思想上背上了严重的包袱。
    今年一月十日诸城县召开了九届一次（代行人民代表大会职权）各界人民代表会议。代表们在会上对政府的工作提了很多意见，李县长一条一条地作了深刻的检讨，并表示今后坚决改正，这受到代表们的热烈欢迎，一致选他继续当县长。十区王元村干部石文升强奸妇女，敲诈勒索，屡教不改，代表一致反对他，结果石文升被判处了一年半徒刑。董会祯在这次会上思想上开始开了窍，他想：县长有了错都能检讨、改正，不怕丢人；我为什么不能检讨、改正呢？如果发展下去岂不要走石文升的道路吗？于是他下决心转变作风。
    区委在反对官僚主义斗争中，也深入检查了领导上的缺点，并分析了董会祯的强迫命令是和区委的官僚主义分不开的。这就更进一步地消除了董会祯的顾虑，开始反复地在支部会、人民代表会和群众会上检讨了他过去产生命令主义的原因，是误认为群众落后，不赶不走；只知道完成数字向上级报成绩，那知道把许多好事都办坏了，脱离了群众。更不应该忘掉了过去受地主的压迫，今天翻了身又反过头来统治人民。最后，他表示坚决改正错误，有事情和大家商量办，决不再犯强迫命令。这样在大、小会上反复的检讨了七次，群众也都诚恳地严厉地批评了他。同时，群众也认为：董会祯工作积极，立场坚定，大公无私，能吃苦，就是强迫命令作风太严重，只要今后能改正，还能继续为大家办事。这些意见完全打破了董会祯怕群众看不到他过去成绩的顾虑，他深深体会到：有了错误赶紧改正，群众是会原谅的，今后好好干，也会得到群众拥护。这以后，他就拿定主意，用实际行动改正错误，决心给群众办好事情。今春柏戈乡春荒严重，很多人失掉自救信心，有的打算到外面逃荒，有的单纯等待政府救济。董会祯看到这种严重情况，便组织乡、村干部深入各村逐户访问，了解了灾情，通过互助组开展了互借互助，他亲自帮助张奇订出了生产自救计划，在群众会上作了介绍，广泛地组织了生产自救，战胜了春荒。在贯彻婚姻法运动中，董会祯的妻子想干涉女儿董爱美的婚姻，引起一些群众不满，董会祯耐心地说服了她，支持了女儿的婚姻自主，推动了该乡婚姻法的贯彻。群众普遍反映：董会祯变好了，耳朵里的蜂蜡化了，和群众通气了。在今年的乡人民代表会议上，董会祯被选为乡长。
    董会祯自当了乡长后，改变了过去强迫命令的作风。在乡总支的统一领导下，他亲自掌握一个互助组，发现组员当中普遍存在着“地湿晚不了”的不愿早种的思想，影响着春耕工作。他便根据去年柏戈庄农民由于存在着等待思想，晚种了两天而落了干，使八百多亩地翻种二楂，费了工夫，少打了粮食的经验教训，在组员当中进行了算账对比，使大家认识了深耕多耙、适时播种才能增产的道理，帮助大家作出了春耕春种计划。董会祯又亲自领导大家扩大了互助组织，伙买耕牛一头，整理了计工算账办法，计划了破犋耕种以解决耕牛不足的困难，组内劳动力作了适当分工，检查、修理了农具。全组妇女下坡锄麦，两天锄完一遍。六十亩春地，六天耕完，秫谷播种两天结束。在春耕生产中，董会祯及时的以本组的经验推广全乡，大大提高了农民的思想觉悟和生产积极性。全乡四千二百一十亩春地在“谷雨”前就已全部播种完毕，比其他乡提前三天。同时每亩比去年增肥零点八车，绝大部分农户使用了地下杀虫药剂，为全年增产打好了基础。董会祯又通过总结生产能手姜砚田采用一年两季轮作法，使玉米得到增产的经验，向农民进行宣传，使全乡种玉米由去年的二百四十六亩增至四百二十五亩，为推行一年二季耕作法打下了基础。该乡农民使用化学肥料很不习惯，董会祯便先买了三十斤，上了自己的一亩四分谷子作试验，五天后谷子变了样，他便召集了变工组长和群众前往参观，当场推销了二百一十斤。小麦还没登场，董会祯同志想：“四三八”麦种确实好，但怎样能推广开呢？他便约同劳动模范、变工组长到自己地里研究，通过数麦粒、比成色、算产量等方法，证明了同样地质的地种“四三八”小麦每亩就可比当地小麦多产四十八斤。接着，又召集了广大农民到田间参观，结果八百五十斤“四三八”小麦在两天内就全部换光。
    随着董会祯作风的转变，柏戈乡的工作，已进入了新的阶段。群众普遍感觉：今年和往年大不一样。董会祯同志也体会到他往年的工作方法是：“强迫、平堆、硬灌”，而今春他所以能把工作作好，又得到群众拥护，主要是作到了：“先作、亲教、说透”。
