    [This article reports on the achievements of the production increase and thrift campaign in private enterprises in Wuhan.]
    【Our Newspaper News】Under the unified leadership of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, private enterprises in Wuhan launched a production increase and thrift campaign after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements last year. Because this movement grasped the positive policy of improving production and management, it further mobilized workers, united capitalists, stabilized labor-capital relations, and played a positive role in the transformation of private enterprises and the strengthening of Party leadership.
    After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy over private enterprises was strengthened, and the illegal activities of unscrupulous capitalists were restricted and greatly reduced. This was a significant achievement of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. However, some new problems were also exposed:
    (1) The backwardness of equipment and technology, poor business management, low product quality, and high costs making products unsellable were exposed in private enterprises. Before the "Five-Anti" movement, many capitalists made fortunes through the "five evils" and did not value production. Now that the space for these capitalists to cut corners and engage in speculation and profiteering has shrunk, the fundamental question of how to continue to survive has arisen.
    (2) "Leftist" sentiments arose among some workers and shop assistants. In small and medium-sized enterprises, some workers and shop assistants excessively interfered with the capitalists' "three powers." Some confused labor-capital, employer-employee, and master-apprentice relationships. Some workers and shop assistants became lax in labor discipline.
    (3) Some capitalists adopted a negative attitude towards management, tried to lay off workers, and wanted to "close down."
    The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party analyzed the above situation and believed that the basic reasons were still the poor equipment, low technology, and poor production and business conditions of private enterprises. Therefore, to correct the capitalists' negative management attitude and the workers' overly left sentiments, it was necessary to start with improving the production and management of private enterprises. Therefore, it was decided to launch a production increase and thrift campaign in private enterprises. The guiding principle of the movement was to rely on workers, unite with capitalists, increase production and practice thrift, and benefit both labor and capital. The purpose of the movement was to improve production, to meet the needs of the country and the people, and to benefit both labor and capital.
    To ensure the smooth development of this production increase and thrift campaign, Wuhan first unified the leadership over private enterprises and established the Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Committee as the overall leading body for the city. Heads of all units related to private enterprises were sent to participate in this committee. Any important issues and measures of any agency concerning private enterprises had to be discussed by the Production Increase and Thrift Campaign Committee. This achieved the effect of unifying thinking, unifying steps, and mutual cooperation.
    The production increase and thrift campaign in Wuhan's private enterprises was divided into four steps. The first step was to further mobilize the masses and conduct class education among the workers. The meaning and purpose of increasing production and practicing thrift were explained to the workers and capitalists, the policies were repeatedly explained, and the concerns of the masses were eliminated. The focus of class education was to educate the workers about the "three rights" and "four rights." Workers should respect the capitalists' property rights, management rights, and personnel transfer rights. At the same time, workers have the right to suggest, the right to protest, the right to supervise, and the right to accuse (the right to accuse means that when capitalists have illegal acts, workers should not deal with them directly but should accuse them to the government).
    The second step in Wuhan's campaign to increase production and thrift in private enterprises was to carry out necessary and appropriate production reforms. Due to poor management of private enterprises, great waste, low efficiency, poor quality, and the inability of the workers to fully utilize their potential and wisdom, it was necessary to thoroughly change these difficulties and continue to transform private enterprises in the campaign to increase production and thrift. The main content of production reform was to mobilize the masses to investigate waste, investigate production, investigate management systems, investigate unity, and investigate work attitude. This step was of great educational significance to both workers and capitalists, especially the role of investigating waste. After finding the reasons through the "five investigations," the workers were mobilized to use their brains, think of ways, and make rationalization proposals, and various relatively advanced systems were initially established, such as the production record system, the quality inspection system, and the shift handover system.
    The third step was to make plans and sign contracts, and to conditionally carry out labor emulation. This was a step to further implement production reform. The main content was to stipulate various quotas, formulate and discuss production plans, formulate workshop and group production increase and thrift plans and related contracts, and carry out safety and health inspections. Finally, in order to ensure the completion of the plan, a collective labor-capital contract was signed, with the capitalists proposing ways to improve management, and the workers launching a labor emulation campaign with the content of "reducing costs and improving quality."
    The fourth step was to summarize experiences, consolidate results, and formulate the next production plan, preparing to sign the contract again. Consolidating results mainly involves rectifying trade union organizations, establishing and developing Party and Youth League organizations.
    While carrying out the production increase and thrift campaign, in order to help private enterprises alleviate the difficult situation at that time, Wuhan took a series of measures under the central government's instructions to adjust commerce, such as developing urban-rural exchanges, adjusting commerce, and adjusting public-private relations, thus promoting market activity.
    In the process of carrying out the production increase and thrift campaign in Wuhan's private enterprises, the labor-capital consultation meeting played a great role. In the past, insufficient respect was given to the capitalists' "three rights," and the capitalists had great concerns, daring neither to manage nor not to manage. During the movement, the production increase and thrift committees in various districts held forums for capitalists, and factories also promoted the capitalists to formulate production plans at labor-capital consultation meetings. After the production plans were passed by the labor-capital consultation meetings, they were announced to the workers, and then the workers were mobilized to discuss them. Issues related to modifying quotas, improving equipment and management, and safety and health, and excess bonuses raised during the discussion were resolved through labor-capital consultation. This also changed the phenomenon in private enterprises that the trade union only talked about welfare and did not manage production, or that it wanted to take care of everything on its own. The capitalists became active because the "three rights" were respected.
    The production increase and thrift campaign in Wuhan's private enterprises further mobilized the workers, established the leading core of the Party, the Youth League, and the trade union, and established new labor-capital relations. In private enterprises where the masses have been fully mobilized, the masses' demand for progress has become a trend. By December of last year, all factories that had launched the production increase and thrift campaign had re-elected their trade union organizations, and a total of more than 1,300 Communist Party members and more than 2,000 Youth League members had been developed. The workers consciously implemented the Party's policies, took the initiative to improve production, abide by labor discipline, and appropriately solve welfare issues. When they encounter difficulties in production and management, they can take the initiative to unite the capitalists to overcome them, and they can supervise the illegal acts of the capitalists.
    The production increase and thrift campaign in Wuhan's private enterprises also improved management, reformed unreasonable systems, and overcame the phenomenon of no one being responsible and chaos in production. For example, the labor-capital consultation meeting system and the capitalists' business meetings and the labor's production meetings were improved. The organization was adjusted and the organization of labor was improved, reducing non-production personnel and enriching the production departments. Some large factories recommended a group of excellent workers and staff to take on administrative management work, strengthening administrative management to serve production. At the same time, the planning of production was also appropriately strengthened, overcoming the chaotic phenomena of working overtime, disregarding costs, quality specifications, and quotas, and production delays.
    In Wuhan, private enterprises that have launched the production increase and thrift campaign generally increased production by 30% to 50%, and the quality has also greatly improved. For example, the No. 1 Towel Factory increased its production by 70% in November last year, and the number of defective products dropped from 30% to 8%. The factory's products were originally difficult to sell, but now they sell well in the Central South and Northwest regions. The total value of production of the nine weaving factories in Jianghan District increased by 48% in November last year. The Xinya Paper Mill increased from producing 12 reams of paper per day to 35 reams, and went from losing money to making money. The output of the flour industry has also increased a lot. The flour yield did not meet the standards set by the grain company in the past, but now it generally exceeds this standard. The improvement in the production of these enterprises is inseparable from the creative labor of the workers. According to the statistics of 87 factories in November last year, workers made a total of more than 690 rationalization proposals, increasing production and saving a value of 7.1 billion yuan.
    The capitalists saw that it was profitable and there was something to do, and their confidence in management was also encouraged. According to the statistics of 87 factories in November last year, 66 capitalists have become active in management, 14 have begun to be active, and only 7 are not very active. For example, the owner of the Liu Taichang Factory never went to the factory before the movement, thinking that he would get by one day at a time. When he heard that someone had closed down, he went to congratulate and learn "experience." Now he has made a production plan and is preparing to purchase new machines. The capitalists of the Lianye Machine Factory used to say to the workers, "It's better to lay off workers earlier and sell the machines to get some money, otherwise there will be no money for severance pay." Now they are seriously studying production with the workers.
    In the past, some private enterprise employees complained that the government only paid attention to state-owned enterprises and not to the work of private enterprises. In this movement, many practical problems of the employees have been solved. According to the statistics of 87 factories in November last year, a total of 129 cases of wages, welfare, medical and health care, and rewards were solved. In the summary of advanced experiences, more than 1,000 workers were commended and 290 people received bonuses, initially solving the difficulties of more than 3,500 people who were about to lose their jobs. The workers also changed their past views and improved their enthusiasm for production.
    The production increase and thrift campaign also educated and improved the ideological and policy level of cadres. After the "Five-Anti" movement, some cadres were unwilling to do work in private enterprises. In this movement, they deeply realized the importance of doing a good job in private enterprises and the importance of educating and uniting capitalists.
    The achievements of the production increase and thrift campaign in Wuhan's private enterprises cannot be overestimated. As a result of the past reactionary rule, Wuhan is a city with excessive commerce and less industry, and some capitalists use the name of running industry to engage in speculation and profiteering. They did not manage industry well, so the factory equipment was backward, the technology was not high, and the quality of the products was very poor. Since liberation, especially after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, although these situations have changed, it will take a considerable amount of time to change this fundamental situation. Even at present, there are still some problems that have not been well resolved, such as the lack of planning for processing orders and the quality of products that could have been improved but has not yet been improved. These all need to be carefully analyzed and further resolved under possible conditions.

    武汉市私营企业开展增产节约运动有成绩
    【本报讯】武汉市私营企业在中共武汉市委的统一领导下，在去年“三反”、“五反”运动之后，开展了增产节约运动。这个运动因为掌握了搞好生产和经营的积极方针，因此进一步发动了职工，团结了资本家，稳定了劳资关系，并对私营企业的改造和加强党的领导都有了积极的作用。
    “三反”、“五反”之后，工人阶级和国营经济对私营企业的领导力量加强了，不法资本家的五毒行为受到限制而大大减轻了，这是“三反”、“五反”运动重大的成果；但同时也暴露了一些新的问题：
    （一）暴露了私营企业的设备、技术落后，经营管理不善，产品质量低，成本高卖不出去。“五反”前许多资本家靠五毒发财，不重生产；现在这些资本家的偷工减料、投机倒把的地盘缩小了，就发生了如何继续生存的根本问题。
    （二）在一些工人店员中产生了“左”的情绪。在中小企业中某些工人店员过分干涉资方的“三权”。有的将劳资、雇佣、师徒关系混淆。有些工人、店员劳动纪律松弛。
    （三）有些资本家经营态度消极，设法解雇工人，想“关门大吉”。
    中共武汉市委分析了以上情况，认为基本的原因还是私营企业设备不好、技术不高、生产和营业情况不好。因此要纠正资本家消极的经营态度和工人过左情绪，必须从改进私营企业的生产经营着手，所以就决定在私营企业中开展增产节约运动。运动的方针是依靠工人，团结资方，增产节约，劳资两利。运动的目的是为了搞好生产，为了国家和人民的需要，为了劳资两利。
    武汉市为保证这个增产节约运动的顺利开展，首先统一了对私营企业的领导，建立了增产节约运动委员会为全市总的领导机关。凡是一切与私营企业有关的单位都派了负责人参加这一委员会；任何机关对私营企业有比较重大的问题与措施，都必须经过增产节约运动委员会的讨论。这样就收到了统一思想、统一步骤、互相配合的效果。
    武汉市私营企业开展增产节约运动共分为四个步骤。第一个步骤是进一步发动群众，在工人中进行阶级教育。向工人和资本家说明增产节约的意义和目的，反复交代政策，消除群众顾虑。阶级教育的重点是向工人进行“三权”“四权”教育。工人要尊重资本家的财产权、经营管理权、人事调动权，同时工人有建议权、抗议权、监督权、控诉权（控诉权是指当资本家有不法行为时，工人不应直接处理而应向政府控诉）。
    武汉市开展私营企业增产节约的第二个步骤是进行必要的和适当的生产改革。由于私营企业管理不善，浪费大、效率低、质量差，工人群众的潜力与智慧不能充分发挥，因此要彻底改变这些困难，必须继续在增产节约运动中改造私营企业。生产改革主要是发动群众查浪费、查生产、查经营管理制度、查团结、查劳动态度。这一步骤对工人与资本家都有很大的教育意义，其中尤以查浪费的作用特别大。经过“五查”找出原因后，即发动工人动脑筋、想办法、提合理化建议，初步建立起各种比较先进的制度，如生产纪录制、质量检查制、交接班制等。
    第三个步骤是订计划和签订合同，有条件地开展劳动竞赛。这是进一步贯彻生产改革的步骤。主要内容即是规定各种定额，拟定和讨论生产计划，制订车间、小组增产节约计划和联系合同，并进行安全卫生检查。最后为了保证计划的完成，签订劳资集体合同，由资方提出改善经营管理的办法，工人则开展以“降低成本、提高质量”为内容的劳动竞赛。
    第四个步骤是总结经验巩固成果，并制订下一次的生产计划，准备再次签订合同。巩固成果主要是整顿工会组织，建立和发展党和青年团的组织。
    在开展增产节约运动的同时，为帮助私营企业减轻当时的困难局面，武汉市在中央调整商业的指示下采取了开展城乡交流、调整商业、调整公私关系等一系列的措施，因而促进了市场的活跃。
    武汉市私营企业在开展增产节约运动的过程中，劳资协商会议起了很大作用。过去对资本家的“三权”尊重不够，资本家顾虑很大，既不敢管又不敢不管。在运动中各区增产节约委员会召开了资本家座谈会，各厂亦在劳资协商会议上推动资方拟订生产计划，由劳资协商会议通过后即向职工宣布，然后即发动职工进行讨论。在讨论中提出的有关修改定额、改进设备与管理及安全卫生、超额奖金等问题，再经劳资协商求得解决。这也就改变了私营企业中工会不管生产只谈福利的现象或要管就一手包办的做法。资本家因“三权”得到尊重而积极起来。
    武汉市私营企业增产节约运动，也进一步发动了工人，树立了党、青年团、工会的领导核心，建立了新的劳资关系。凡是群众已充分发动的私营企业，群众要求进步成了风气。到去年十二月止，凡开展增产节约运动的工厂，都改选了工会组织，共发展共产党员一千三百多名，青年团员两千多名。工人自觉地贯彻党的政策，主动地搞好生产，遵守劳动纪律，适当地解决福利问题。他们遇到生产经营上的困难能主动地团结资本家加以克服，对资本家不法行为又能加以监督。
    武汉市私营企业增产节约运动，也改善了经营管理，改革了不合理的制度，克服了无人负责及生产中的混乱现象。如健全了劳资协商会议制度和资方的业务会议、劳方的生产会议。调整了机构和改善了劳动力的组织，减少了非生产人员，充实了生产部门。有的大厂推荐了一批优秀工人职员担任行政管理工作，加强行政管理为生产服务。同时也适当加强了生产的计划性，克服了加班加点，不计成本，不计品质规格，不计定额以及生产误期等混乱现象。
    在武汉市，凡是开展了增产节约运动的私营企业，一般提高了产量百分之三十到五十，质量也有了很大提高。如一中毛巾厂去年十一月产量提高了百分之七十，次货从百分之三十降到百分之八，该厂产品本来销路不好，现在则畅销中南、西北各地。江汉区九个织布厂去年十一月份的生产总值增加百分之四十八。新亚造纸厂由日产十二令纸提高到三十五令，由赔本走向赚钱。面粉业产量也提高了很多，出粉率过去达不到粮食公司规定的标准，现在，一般都超过了这个标准。这些企业生产的提高是与工人群众的创造性的劳动分不开的。根据去年十一月八十七个厂的统计，工人提合理化建议共六百九十余件，增产节约价值七十一亿元。
    资本家看到有利可图、有事可做，经营信心也得到鼓舞。据去年十一月八十七个厂的统计，资方转变为积极经营的有六十六家，开始积极的有十四家，还不甚积极的仅七家。如刘泰昌工厂厂主，在运动前从不到工厂，以为混一天算一天，听说人家停了业就去道贺并学习“经验”。现在他已订了生产计划，并准备添购新机器。联业机器厂的资方过去曾向工人说：“早一点解雇还可卖机器拿几个，要拖下去连解雇费也没有”。现在则和工人一起认真研究生产。
    过去有些私营企业职工埋怨政府只注意国营企业不注意私营企业的工作。这次运动中，职工们许多实际问题得到了解决，根据去年十一月八十七个厂的统计，共解决工资福利、医药卫生、奖励等一百二十九件，在总结先进经验中一千余工人受表扬，二百九十人得到奖金，初步解决了三千五百余人即将失业的困难。工人群众也改变了过去的看法，提高了生产积极性。
    增产节约运动也教育和提高了干部思想和政策水平。“五反”后有些干部不愿做私营企业工作。在这次运动中深刻认识到搞好私营企业工作的重要性，和必须做好教育与团结资本家的重要意义。
    武汉市私营企业增产节约运动的成绩不能估计过高。武汉市由于过去反动统治的结果，是一个商业过剩的城市，工业较少，并且有些资本家借办工业之名，作投机捣把之实。他们没有很好地经营工业，因此，工厂设备落后，技术不高，产品品质很坏。解放以来，尤其在“三反”、“五反”以后，这些情况虽有改变，但要改变这一根本情况，还得有一个相当长的时间。就在目前还有一些问题没有很好解决，如加工定货的缺乏计划性，产品的质量本来可以提高而尚未提高，这些都还需要精细分析，在可能的条件下进一步加以解决。
