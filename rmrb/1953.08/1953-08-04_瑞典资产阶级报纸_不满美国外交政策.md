Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, August 2nd: Many Swedish bourgeois newspapers are deeply disturbed by the current U.S. foreign policy, which not only fails to ease but exacerbates international tensions. For example, Swedish newspapers have criticized Dulles's remarks on the U.S. attitude towards the upcoming political conference.

The bourgeois newspaper "Expressen" said: "The most surprising thing is that Dulles actually announced in advance that the country he represents would adopt an extreme attitude at the upcoming political conference, an attitude that would make all negotiations with the other side extremely complicated. This really undermines Churchill's plan. No wonder British public opinion has expressed shock and anger..."

The Social Democratic newspaper "Arbetet" pointed out that the leaders of U.S. foreign policy are increasingly relying on the most reactionary elements in the world. The newspaper said: "After the defeat of Nazi Germany, it was obvious how quickly the American financial groups re-established contact with the West German capitalist groups that had previously supported Hitler. The revival of Krupp can be said to be a clear example of this trend. Many aspects of the current U.S. policy regarding the rearmament of West Germany can be said to be the result of the powerful American industrial groups influencing U.S. foreign policy. There are reports that reactionary elements within the U.S. Republican Party are establishing ties with Europe's mad anti-democratic forces. Looking at what was said above, this news is very meaningful."

### 瑞典资产阶级报纸  不满美国外交政策

    瑞典资产阶级报纸
    不满美国外交政策
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩二日讯：瑞典许多资产阶级报纸对于不但不能缓和、反而加剧国际紧张局势的美国目前外交政策深表不安。例如，瑞典报纸纷纷抨击杜勒斯就美国关于即将举行的政治会议的态度所发表的谈话。
    资产阶级报纸“快报”说：“最令人惊奇的事情是，杜勒斯竟然预先宣布了他所代表的国家在即将举行的政治会议上将采取极端态度，这种态度将使与对方进行的一切谈判变得极其复杂。“这真正破坏了邱吉尔的计划。无怪乎英国的舆论表示震惊和愤怒……”
    社会民主党报纸“劳动报”指出，美国外交政策的领导人越来越依靠世界上最反动的分子。该报说：“纳粹德国失败后，人们显然可以看出，美国的金融集团如何迅速地和以前支持希特勒的西德资本主义集团重新建立起联系。克虏伯的重起可以说是这种趋势的明证之一。目前美国政策中关于重新武装西德的许多方面可以说是有势力的美国工业集团影响美国外交政策的结果。有消息说美国共和党内的反动分子在和欧洲疯狂的反民主势力建立联系。参看上面所说看来，这个消息是意味深长的。”
