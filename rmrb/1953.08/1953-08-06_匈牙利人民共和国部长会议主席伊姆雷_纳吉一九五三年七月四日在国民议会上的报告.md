Editor's Note: The National Assembly of the Hungarian People's Republic held its first meeting on July 3rd and 4th after being re-elected in May of this year. At the meeting on July 4th, based on the proposal of the Hungarian People's Independent Front, a new Council of Ministers headed by Imre Nagy, a member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Working People's Party, was elected (see page 4 of this newspaper on July 6th for meeting news). Imre Nagy reported on the government's policy program to the National Assembly. This program made very important clarifications on the Hungarian People's Republic government's economic policy and many important issues in the national economic life. After heated discussions, the Hungarian National Assembly unanimously adopted this policy program. The following is the full text of Imre Nagy's report.

Since our country's liberation, since the working people have taken control of state power, the importance of the democratic and representative National Assembly has greatly increased. Because Hungary established a democratic system, the old parliament that represented landlords and capitalists and excluded the working people—the working class and peasants—from the constitution has been forever eliminated in the storms of history. What that parliament of the upper class left behind with its legislation and misgovernment was a backward, economically underdeveloped country and a people deprived of freedom and rights. Since the people's representatives entered the legislature, the freedoms and rights of the people have been stipulated, the Hungarian working people themselves have become the foundation of legislation, effective legislative work has begun, and the creativity of the people has begun to manifest itself. The previous National Assembly made extremely important contributions to the work of our People's Republic and its achievements in all aspects of economy and culture. The achievements in laying the foundation of socialism and developing the national economy have proved the consciousness, determination, and self-sacrificing spirit of our great working class. The Hungarian working class, which holds state power, is the vanguard and main force of our country's socialism. Facts have proved that they are able to shoulder their current historical tasks and can firmly stand their ground in the face of all difficulties and the threats and temptations of the enemy. Our working class is the main pillar and foundation of our socialist country under construction.

Our hard-working peasants have also made considerable contributions to all our achievements. When they encountered natural disasters, misfortunes, and difficulties, they still loyally supported the People's Republic. They are full of hope and confidence in the future and are reaping the fruits of their hard work. The loyalty and steadfastness of our working class and peasants to the country should be deeply appreciated and thanked by us. All our achievements should be attributed to our party—the Hungarian Working People's Party—which stands at the forefront of the working class and leads our working people onto the broad road of building socialism.

Our most valuable treasure is our freedom, which is the source of all our achievements. Because of freedom, our working class and peasants can accomplish their historical mission, eliminate the backwardness of our country over the years, and abolish the ancient system of exploitation. Freedom has opened the road to socialism. Freedom has liberated the creativity of our people and made our country prosperous with the most brilliant achievements in our history. The Soviet people brought us this freedom at the cost of their children's blood, enabling us to establish a free and independent country and create a prosperous and happy life for our working people. Therefore, all our successes and achievements should be attributed to the Soviet Union—the selfless friend of the people of small countries and the fortress of peace and freedom.

Liberation has unfolded before us the prospect of building a progressive and socialist new country. However, if we had not received the comprehensive and strong assistance of the Soviet Union, we would not have been able to carry out this huge task with our own strength and resources. In our great work of building socialism and improving the material life of the working people, the Soviet Union has given us invaluable assistance in accordance with the principle of economic mutual assistance and cooperation. Therefore, when we talk about our achievements today, we must also express our sincere gratitude to the Soviet people and the Soviet government.

In our constitutional life and in the progress of the People's Republic, each convening of the National Assembly is a milestone on the road to clearing the economic and political foundations of the old system, consolidating the country's reconstruction, progress, peace, and independence.

The current National Assembly elected on May 17th has further developed the democratic principle of representing the people and strengthened its inseparable link with the owner of political power—the working people. Its foundation is more solid than that of the previous National Assembly. This fact gives the tasks and spirit of the current National Assembly and the mission it assumes in our constitutional life a new content that conforms to the interests of the people. We can very well say that the meeting of the current National Assembly marks a new stage in our development. In this stage, the sovereignty of the people and the great role played by the National Assembly in managing state affairs, deciding on the basic principles and goals of the responsible government, and exercising the legitimate rights of the National Assembly will be more clearly manifested.

In fulfilling its duties, the government will rely on the National Assembly to a greater extent. The government is entrusted by the National Assembly to manage the country, and the government will be fully responsible to the National Assembly in all administrative work, the country's welfare, and the people's prosperity. At the same time, the government hopes that the Council of Ministers, with the help of the National Assembly, will become an institution with full authority to manage state affairs, based on the broader powers of the various ministries and the greater responsibilities of the various ministers. This is another big step forward on the road to the democratization of our national life.

In developing our national economy, we must consider our country's economic resources.

When it comes to economic policy, I would like to emphasize that the government is implementing economic policies based on realistic goals and new instructions from the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party. That is, in developing our national economy, the government must take into account the country's economic resources and should not set itself tasks that are not necessary to achieve, whether the raw materials or investments exceed what the country can afford, or other excessive economic tasks that are detrimental to the people's living standards. In economic policy, the government will abide by the maxim of "cutting clothes according to the cloth." However, it must be clear, and it must be frankly acknowledged in front of the whole country, that the goals of the expanded Five-Year Plan, in many respects, exceeded the scope of our resources, excessively used our capabilities, and hindered the growth of the material foundations of life. Especially recently, it has lowered the living standards. Obviously, there must be significant modifications in this regard. The purpose of developing socialist industry is not just for development itself. As we move towards socialism along the path of people's democracy and socialist industrialization, we must find ways to continuously improve the living standards of the working people, and we must better meet the social and cultural needs of the working people, especially the needs of the working class, which is the main force in socialist construction. One of the most important tasks of the government's economic policy is to comprehensively and substantially reduce production and investment according to the country's potential, the speed of national economic development, and our investment. The government will revise the national economic plan in terms of both production and investment and will draft a plan to make corresponding contractions to the overall plan.

The trend of national economic development must also be modified. We have no reason to implement excessive industrialization, no reason to pursue industrial self-sufficiency, especially when we do not have the necessary raw material reserves. National self-sufficiency means economic isolation, means overburdening the country's potential, and will inevitably abandon the benefits that can be obtained from participating in international trade, trading with capitalist countries, and especially the existing economic mutual assistance and cooperation with the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and China. The government's economic policy should be more mindful of the strength of resources and reduce the burden on the national economy.

Our economic policy in this regard must also be changed: we must focus more on developing light industry and the food industry that produce daily necessities than in the past. We must greatly reduce the speed of development of heavy industry that manufactures the means of production and take steps to better meet the people's increasingly high needs.

The economic policies regarding the two major sectors of the national economy—industry and agriculture—must also be changed. Due to excessive industrialization, especially the too-rapid development of heavy industry, which requires large-scale investment, the country's materials are insufficient to supply the development of agriculture. As a result, because industry—first of all, almost only heavy industry—developed too quickly, agricultural production stagnated, and it cannot guarantee to meet the rapidly growing industrial demand for raw materials and the increasing demand for food from industrial workers and the entire population. In order to promote the greatest possible prosperity in production as soon as possible, the government believes that one of its most important tasks is to substantially increase investment in agriculture while reducing investment in industry.

The huge changes to be implemented in our economic plan, namely focusing on reducing the speed of socialist industrialization and increasing agricultural development, reflect the goals of the government's economic policy: to continuously improve the living standards of the working people—especially the working class.

The change in the speed of industrial production and the related redeployment of investment, as well as the formulation of new production and investment plans, require far-sighted and thorough work. It is the primary responsibility of the State Planning Commission to implement this work as quickly as possible in accordance with the principles determined by the government, and to find ways to ensure that the reorganization of industry is unimpeded and that production continues, while strictly observing labor discipline and striving to ensure the completion of tasks.

This is absolutely necessary, because completing the industrial production plan is a necessary prerequisite for all measures taken by the government to implement economic policies and improve living standards. If the industrial plan is not fully completed, it is impossible to develop agricultural production. Therefore, the key to the successful realization of the government's goals lies in the working class. This means responsibility on both sides. On the one hand, the government must take the necessary measures to improve the living standards of the working class and well meet their material, social, and cultural needs—the government has decided to start this work and must complete it; on the other hand, the working class should strengthen labor discipline and ensure the completion of production tasks in accordance with the plan. Our workers should abide by the plan and be prepared to do so. I believe they will gloriously and wholeheartedly shoulder this task.

Guarantees for farmers' production and property

Another important part of our national economy is agriculture. In this regard, the government is facing new tasks. Due to the aforementioned low investment, and the relatively decreasing investment in recent years, due to the neglect of helping individual farmers, due to the accelerated development of agricultural production cooperatives without sufficient economic and political foundations, the farmers felt uneasy about cultivation, and these reasons have caused agricultural production to stagnate in recent years. In the frequent and large-scale land mergers, many coercive things happened, making farmers feel unfair, and at the same time causing them serious economic losses, which is also the reason for the stagnation of agricultural production. Everyone knows that our agricultural production mainly relies on the small-scale peasant economy, and their production is necessary for the country. Moreover, their development in both crop production and animal husbandry is related to the interests of the country. The government believes that encouraging the production of individual farmers is the primary task, and the government will help them obtain the means of production, tools, chemical fertilizers, improved seeds and other agricultural technology needs.

The government will do its best to protect farmers' production activities and their property. Therefore, this year it is forbidden to carry out ordinary autumn land mergers, because this arbitrary merger of land hinders intensive cultivation and reduces farmers' enthusiasm for production.

Undoubtedly, the acceleration of the agricultural cooperative movement and the aggressively pursuing the increase in the number of agricultural production cooperatives, so that a part of the existing cooperatives cannot obtain enough economic strength to strengthen the organization, these are unfavorable to agricultural production. But the most serious result of the aggressively developing agricultural cooperative movement is: sometimes forced orders occurred, destroying the principle of voluntary joining, which caused great anxiety among the working farmers. As a result, it hindered the progress of production work, and the investment necessary for improving cultivation was greatly reduced.

Secondly, the excessive measures generally taken against rich peasants have made the country have to worry more and more year by year about the use of the government's reserve land, and due to the instability and difficulty of farming conditions, this land has not yet been cultivated.

Based on the above, the government believes that the first priority should be to stabilize agricultural production, which is the current urgent matter. In order to give working farmers guarantee of all opportunities, so that they can cultivate with peace of mind, and eliminate their concerns about being forced to join agricultural production cooperatives, the government believes that it is correct and necessary to reduce the speed of the agricultural cooperative movement. In order to ensure strict compliance with the principle of voluntariness, if members of agricultural production cooperatives think that working alone is more beneficial to them, then they should be allowed to withdraw. If the majority of the members hope to dissolve the cooperative, the government will allow them to dissolve it. At the same time, the government will continue to vigorously support the cooperatives, provide loans and investments, so that the cooperative organization will be more consolidated, and the lives of the members will become more and more prosperous, because the government believes that this is the best way to promote the progress of the peasant class. The government will allow the free leasing of land. If someone is willing to take back for their own use the land that they previously dedicated to the state and is now retained by the government as part of the reserve land, they can take it back, and the government will lend them seeds and mechanical farm implements. If someone wants to lease reserve land from the government, they can lease it for five years, instead of just one year as now.

The measures planned by the government are suitable for the development of our agriculture, and the prosperous development of agriculture is one of the most important goals of our economic policy. I believe that our sincere efforts will surely win the widespread approval and support of the farmers. A government that unhesitatingly learns lessons from past mistakes, dares to correct mistakes, and vigorously supports the work of farmers, is convinced that it can gain the approval and support of farmers.

In other aspects of our economic life, the government also needs to change the economic policies of the past. In recent years, the country's economic activities have extended to certain sectors, where private enterprises can still play an important role and can better meet the needs of the people, such as retail trade and handicrafts. Although production cooperatives have developed considerably, they cannot make up for the shortage of handicraft production. Therefore, the government allows private enterprises to exist and will issue business licenses in accordance with the law, and will also provide necessary assistance, such as supplying materials and loans. It is necessary to vigorously develop trade between urban and rural areas. For this goal, on the one hand, it is necessary to supply a large number of industrial products, and at the same time, due to the good harvest, it is also necessary to supply a large number of surplus agricultural products.

Continuously improving the people's living standards is the main principle of our new economic policy.

This is the main and most sublime purpose of our developing the national economy and completing the plan. The only appropriate way to build socialism that the working people can accept is to improve the people's living standards, especially the living standards of the working class, and to continuously improve their material, cultural, and social status. This is the central issue in the planning and development of our entire national economy, and we have made serious mistakes in this regard—especially in relation to industrial workers—that need to be corrected urgently. The measures taken by the government for this purpose will enable the consumption of the main food and industrial products of the working class and the people to increase. This year, a good harvest of agricultural products is expected, which will make it easier for the government to carry out this work, be able to supply more food, thereby increasing the real wages of workers and staff, generally speaking, those who live on wages.

The government is determined to lower the high prices. When the harvest is completed and the industrial production plan is fully completed, the food supply will increase, and it will be possible to reduce the prices of certain food and industrial products that are still expensive. The government will never delay in this aspect of work. We have already reduced the prices of many seasonal products to below the level of 1951. We have ensured that before the autumn harvest, there will be more important commodities such as flour, sugar, meat, and oils supplied to the market. After the autumn harvest, there will be further improvements and price reductions. Everyone knows that in early July, we have reduced the prices of many industrial products by 15 to 30 percent, and we have also started to make the supply of these goods abundant and diverse.

These measures all show that the government is determined to improve the work of supplying consumer products for the people. This is not just a promise, but has already begun to be implemented. We want to accelerate the manufacturing of consumer goods and food. In the second half of this year, we want to increase the appropriations for factory meals and factory public health facilities. We want to revise certain provisions in the labor law. Fines as a disciplinary measure against workers and staff will be abolished.

The provisions of the labor law regarding labor protection must be unconditionally and fully complied with. Safety equipment must be guaranteed and nutritious food and work clothes must be provided. Anyone who misappropriates funds for worker health care will be severely punished. In order to better protect the workers' work ability, it is necessary to reduce unjustified extra work and Sunday overtime. In addition to the regular weekly rest day, various measures will be taken to ensure that the working people can use their free time outside of working hours.

We want to improve urban and rural public utilities with large amounts of investment. In 1954, we will allocate a considerable amount of funds to build apartments and subsidize private construction of houses. It is expected that a total of 40,000 housing units will be built, while only 23,000 units were built in 1953. The state encourages and subsidizes the miners' own plans to build houses and dormitories. In Budapest, first of all, the public housing in the capital's workers' districts must be repaired at any time, and must be improved within two years. 40 percent of the rental income will be used for repair expenses, which is twice the amount spent in 1952. Measures such as these to improve the living and working conditions of urban residents—especially industrial workers—are too numerous to mention.

We also want to vigorously improve the living conditions of rural residents. In addition to the above-mentioned assistance to agricultural production, in order to improve the health of livestock, we will implement free veterinary services. This will not only save farmers a large amount of expenses, but also promote the development of animal husbandry. Undoubtedly, our farmers will heartily welcome this measure. We will stop compulsory production contracts and use special preferential treatment and supply more industrial products to create conditions so that farmers know that production under contract is beneficial, so they are happy to do so. In order to ensure the supply of the increasing demand in rural areas, the National Cooperative Federation must greatly increase the goods of supply and marketing cooperatives in rural areas. There must be various goods of excellent quality to meet the needs of farmers.

We will again review the overdue debts owed by agricultural production cooperatives to the state and will reduce and exempt a large part of them. In addition, the compensation fees that individual farmers and production cooperatives were fined for failing to deliver the agricultural products purchased by the state are not always fair and reasonable, and these will also be reduced and exempted. The total amount of this payment is about 600 million forints.

We will simplify the procedures for paying agricultural products. We will realize the promises made in the Hungarian People's Independent Front's announcement to voters. In the new system of agricultural product payment that will be implemented next year, we will pre-determine the amount of payment for several years, so that working farmers can know in advance how much they have to turn over, can sell the remaining products on the free market, and can cultivate with peace of mind.

In order to effectively help individual farmers and agricultural production cooperatives, in order to overcome the difficulties caused by the severe frost disaster last year in the shortest possible time, anyone who pays this year's grain and fodder on time, the government will exempt him from the amount he has owed in the past.

The above-mentioned various measures clearly show that the government is not stingy, and shows that the government is most willing to help the people. Without a doubt, we are not just talking empty words, but we must accurately and fully complete the tasks we have undertaken in front of the people of the country, we must abide by our promises, which the Hungarian people have repeatedly seen for themselves in recent years. The government is innocent of conscience, and it has the right to expect—in fact, demand—that individual farmers and production cooperatives pay the agricultural products and taxes they should give to the country in a timely and complete manner. Therefore, individual farmers and production cooperatives must fulfill their civic obligations. This is a legal obligation, and the government must make it comply with it. Whoever answers the government's goodwill and great assistance by despising the interests of the country and violating the law can only blame himself. Obeying the legal system—the government will formulate effective measures to achieve this goal—not only means that the state has the responsibility to protect the rights of farmers from infringement, but also includes the obligation of farmers to fulfill their obligations to pay agricultural products and taxes to the state. On the other hand, anyone who has faithfully completed the obligation of paying agricultural products should never bear any additional taxes. This is clearly stipulated in the law, and anyone who increases the burden on farmers beyond the legal obligation will be severely punished.

Intellectuals should be respected in our people's democratic country.

Our national economy's two main sectors—industry and agriculture—are the scope of activities of our country's two closely cooperating classes—the working class and the peasants. Intellectuals also participate in the work of these two main sectors and shoulder important tasks in our cultural life. But unfortunately, intellectual work and intellectuals in general—especially old intellectuals—still have not received the due respect—the government is willing to work hard to change this phenomenon—they are often surrounded by an atmosphere of distrust. As a result, when our economic, cultural, and scientific life is almost lacking experienced and trained intellectuals in every aspect, the atmosphere of distrust makes us look down on them. The socialist development of our national economy provides them with an extremely broad scope for their activities, but due to distrust or inappropriate cleansing, good intellectuals are treated in a way that the People's Republic should not have, and they are often deprived of the opportunity to use their professional knowledge to serve the country. The government will use strong means to stop this inappropriate and intolerable behavior, and must remedy this fault wherever it should be remedied. Intellectuals should be respected people in our People's Republic, whether they are teachers, engineers, lawyers, doctors, agronomists, or others, they should enjoy a respectable position in their profession. Everyone must understand that in the people's democratic country, education and knowledge are more respected than in the past—under the old system. This respect must be expressed with broad employment opportunities and material rewards.

Our education system also had excesses in training young new intellectuals. We made huge sacrifices to promote compulsory higher education. Now we must be more realistic in this regard. We should not build castles in the air, we must pay more attention to primary schools than in the past, we must increase primary school funding, add more primary schools, increase school buildings and teachers, in order to ensure that our Hungarian young generation—the future hope—receives the best primary education. We must admit that due to excessive attention to university education, we have neglected these. In addition, more attention, more care, and more funding must be given to schools in rural areas and factories. Only in this way can a more democratic education policy be promoted.

There should be more tolerance on religious issues. In this regard, it is not allowed to use administrative means sometimes as in the past. On this issue, the government advocates the principle of tolerance, to use methods of enlightenment and education, and to prohibit the use of administrative and other coercive means.

Consolidating the legal system is one of the government's important tasks.

The government's actions are based on the legal order and legal system formulated by the constitution. The foundation of our people's democratic system, our economic and social life, lies in the socialist legal system, in strictly observing the civil rights and obligations stipulated by the constitution, and the laws of the People's Republic. The government is facing the major tasks of correcting serious mistakes, consolidating the legal order, and guaranteeing the legal system. The task and responsibility of the state power organs is to defend our working people's rights from infringement. The task of these organs is not only to ensure that the working people fulfill their obligations, but more to enable every citizen to freely enjoy legal rights. Our working people have every reason to expect these rights from the state. However, the principle of strictly observing the legal system—which is a fundamental principle of governing a people's democratic country—is often not fully observed in the work of our judicial organs, public security organs, and local people's congresses. These organs cannot strictly abide by the legal system in their own work, not only in the state, economic, and social life, as is absolutely required by the people's democratic country and the interests of the people.

Administrative means are widely used for many minor illegal cases. Many excessive behaviors and abuses of power in procurement, taxation, registration of rich peasants, and small land mergers have made the people feel unfair, shaken their faith in the legal system, and weakened the connection between the working people and the state organs and local people's congresses.

The intolerable, rude, cold, and heartless attitude taken by individual bureaucrats in our organs towards ordinary citizens who come to handle their own affairs should be severely criticized. These bureaucrats even implement the correct, just, and legal measures into making people's lives miserable. They forget that they are serving the people, not the people serving them. A humble and humane attitude—these qualities are what every citizen and the government reasonably requires of every staff member in our organs.

Consolidating the legal system is one of the government's most urgent tasks. It will use severe means, and if this does not help, then take severe punishments, to thoroughly eradicate errors and shortcomings, in order to ensure that in a short period of time, the judicial organs, public security organs, and local people's congresses can become strong supporters and guarantees of the state, the people, the legal system, and the legal order. They should better protect the interests of our working people, more vigilantly defend the security of our country, unite with the people, and more forcefully fight against the deadly enemies of our people's democratic system, these deadly enemies must be severely punished in accordance with the law. We cannot give the enemy any foothold or breathing space, because they are trying to destroy our achievements, our independence, and freedom.

But we also know that some misguided people are being pursued by the judicial organs for their more or less crimes. Some people have also been wronged, they may be wronged, because our political organs often do not comply with the provisions of the constitution that guarantee civil rights, personal freedom, and security. The detention system itself has also contributed to violations of the legal system. Undoubtedly, our failure to implement the instructions of the People's Republic's constitution and failing to establish the Supreme Procuratorate as the defender of the legal order and legal system stipulated by the constitution is also a factor that has caused all this to happen. Now we have done this.

Due to all this, in the spirit of magnanimity, in order to appease and fundamentally eliminate many reasonable grievances, the government will submit a draft decree to the National Assembly. According to this decree, all those who have committed crimes but whose cases are not serious and whose release will not endanger the state and social order will be released. At the same time, the government will abolish the detention system and cancel the detention camps. Similarly, the government intends to provide all possibilities for those who have been granted amnesty and those who have been detained to be able to return to their homes, return to society, and become useful members of society through their work. The government also intends to settle those who have been deported to other places, and give them the possibility to choose their place of residence in accordance with the legal regulations applicable to all citizens.

The basic principles of people's democratic justice are incompatible with police justice, which is essentially both a detective agency and a sentencing body. The government intends to eliminate this remnant left over from the old social system through legislative means.

The government attaches particular importance to determining the attitude towards farmers on the political and economic basis of a solid worker-peasant alliance, and to restoring farmers' confidence in the legal order and legal system, because the so-called method of registering rich peasants is a non-negligible factor in promoting the shaking of farmers' confidence. In addition, this registration method has gone so far as to use administrative orders and serious abuses of power to oppose rich peasants, and it has also weakened the good relationship between the government and the working farmers. It is clear that if we want to eliminate illegal and disorderly conduct in rural areas, if we want to restore the legal order and a solid alliance with the middle peasants—and we should do so in any case—then the method of registering rich peasants must be abolished, while adhering to economic measures that restrict rich peasant exploiters.

The active participation of the broad masses of the people is the main guarantee of our success.

Our many measures of great significance in transforming the national economy, consolidating the legal order, and improving living standards, the huge changes that we are currently facing and will implement in all aspects of economic life, all give the National Assembly, the government, and all state institutions major tasks. And these measures are far from including all the work of the government in all aspects of national life. I do not intend to talk about the details. The many major issues that have been mentioned have clearly indicated the new path of the government's economic policy: that is, to move forward with the whole people on a broader basis, perhaps more slowly at the beginning, but more confidently towards a constant goal—towards socialism.

The suggestions made by the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party to the government are a program for the broadest unity of the entire people. By relying on this program, we can make all creative forces and talents serve the prosperity of our motherland and the increasing happiness of the people. These goals can make our working people more closely united around their government than in the past. This is the great power of the government's policy program. With this power, we can start to complete even greater tasks than those guaranteed in the Hungarian People's Independent Front's announcement to voters during the election period. We will make the realization of all these goals and tasks serve the interests of our people and our motherland. Without a doubt, the people of the country will greet our work with joy. The government has a responsibility to make the working people get real benefits from the improvement of living conditions as soon as possible. Our working class, peasants, and intellectuals should clearly understand that the government's measures and methods will bring about profound changes in their situation. If we successfully realize these measures, we will give our enemies the heaviest blow in recent years.

Obviously, these tasks are not easy to complete, nor will they be completed naturally. It must be seen that the most important guarantee of success lies in the active participation of the broad masses. But it must also be seen that there will certainly be some people who cannot or are unwilling to remove the autocratic, excessive, and undemocratic spirit, unwilling to abandon administrative orders, and will try their best to hinder the rapid and smooth realization of the people's welfare measures. The government is vigilantly preparing to use the power of the state organs to quickly and resolutely stop such malicious attempts.

The enemy will try their best to create rumors about our new economic policy and related measures in order to confuse the people. But there is one fact that they cannot refute, and that is that the broadest strata of people will greet this policy with joy and support this policy. This will doom all the enemy's attempts at disruption and destruction to bankruptcy from the very beginning.

The hope of a good harvest is a favorable condition for us to implement these measures. If we now concentrate our main attention on the huge tasks of harvesting, threshing, and purchasing, and actively strive to complete these tasks, then the smooth realization of most economic measures can be said to be guaranteed.

The policy program that we are preparing to implement today has opened a new chapter in our socialist construction. Every one of our goals serves the noble cause of peace. The new tasks and the glorious prospects created by their realization have strengthened the strength of our people and their will to fight for peace. The growth of our country's economic strength and the improvement of our people's lives have greatly consolidated this part of our country on the entire peace front. Therefore, I can boldly say that the realization of the many plans stipulated by the government, in its own meaning, is not only a matter for our country, but a common cause for the entire peace camp.

The Budapest meeting of the World Peace Council is a great manifestation of the international unity of the people who love peace and freedom. The representatives who came to our country can see our people's peaceful creative labor, their remarkable achievements, and their determination to defend the great cause of peace to the end. In recent times, the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism in the world have greatly increased. The elections in Italy on June 7th brought great victory to the Italian Communist Party and the working class. Without the active participation of the Italian Communist Party and the working people, it is impossible to resolve Italy's deepening political crisis and stabilize the volatile domestic situation.

The domestic crisis in France for several weeks also shows the growth of the strength of the Communist Party and the working class and the weakening of the aggressor camp, and at the same time deepened the contradictions within the imperialists. The war-mongers are eager to find a way out for themselves with adventurous acts and despicable provocations. Li Chengwan's crime of obstructing the Korean armistice and refusing to hand over the prisoners of war who should be repatriated, the shameless Berlin provocation—all these are some links in a series of despicable conspiracies by the aggressors. The provocation incidents in Berlin by the imperialist mercenaries are an attack by the reactionary and fascist forces on the peace and security of the people. The provocative conspiracies of the enemies of peace are to hinder the easing of international tensions. The Berlin incident once again clearly shows that the deadly enemies of peace will carry out the most vile provocations, and they will not hesitate to use the most despicable means to achieve their goals. But despite this, the democratic and patriotic forces of the German people have blocked the path of fascism, which shows that the aggression from West Germany can be contained. The events that occurred in Berlin have awakened our vigilance and warned all peace-loving people that they must not forget the enemy's conspiracies for a minute. In order to make the aggressors' malicious plans suffer a shameful defeat, honest and peace-loving people should carry out the cause of defending and consolidating peace with great determination. In order to repel the enemy's attacks, we should more closely unite our ranks—this is the task of all of us who cherish the great cause of peace.

In all its activities, the government relies on the indestructible will of our people to demand peace. In its efforts to defend peace, the government follows the principle of solidarity with the peace-loving people of all countries and sincere friendship with the vanguard of world peace—the great Soviet Union.

The government's policy program clearly shows that we are striving for lasting peace. In the spirit of friendship among the people of all countries, we hope to contribute our meager strength to the increasing economic cooperation among the people of all ethnic groups and to the consolidation of the relationship of peaceful coexistence among them. At the same time, we firmly defend our independence and national sovereignty. Our strength is increasing because we are not alone, because we have the support and help of the Soviet Union, and because we are a member of the invincible world peace camp.

I thank you for your trust in nominating me as the leader of the Council of Ministers. I deeply feel the great responsibility before the motherland and the people. I want to emphasize that the welfare of our people and the constant improvement of the living standards of the working class and all the people—this is the center of the government's work—are based on the productive labor of our people. Only by improving production, completing plans, and extensively carrying out the working people's enthusiastic socialist competition can sufficient goods to prosper material life be guaranteed in industry and agriculture. Today, the attention of the whole country is focused on this meeting, and the decisions to be made by the meeting are urgently awaited by all of our people. I am confident that the working people of our country—the working class, peasants, and intellectuals—who are full of a sense of responsibility for their motherland, will reach the goals we have set.

I firmly believe that, based on the suggestions of the Hungarian Working People's Party, under its leadership, in order to realize the goals of our new economic policy, we will unite with the people of the country, and more confidently than ever before, we will advance along the road that makes our country prosperous, makes the people happy, towards a bright future, towards socialism.

    匈牙利人民共和国部长会议主席伊姆雷·纳吉一九五三年七月四日在国民议会上的报告
    编者按：匈牙利人民共和国国民议会在今年五月改选后，于七月三日至四日举行第一次会议。在七月四日的会议上，根据匈牙利人民独立阵线的建议，选出了以匈牙利劳动人民党政治局委员伊姆雷·纳吉为首的新的部长会议（会议消息见七月六日本报第四版）。伊姆雷·纳吉在国民议会上报告了政府的施政纲领。这一纲领对于匈牙利人民共和国政府的经济政策和国民经济生活中的许多重大问题，作了很重要的阐明。匈牙利国民议会经过热烈讨论后，一致通过了这个施政纲领。下面是伊姆雷·纳吉的报告全文。
    自从我国解放后，自从劳动人民掌握了国家的政权以来，民主的代表人民的国民议会底重要性大大增加了。由于匈牙利建立了民主制度，过去那个代表地主资本家，排斥劳动人民——工人阶级和农民——于宪法之外的旧国会已在历史的风暴中永远消灭了。那个上流社会的国会底立法和恶政留下来的是一个落后的、经济上不发展的国家和被剥夺了自由和权利的人民。自从人民的代表进入立法机构后，规定了人民的自由和权利，匈牙利劳动人民自己成为立法的基础，有成效的立法工作开始了，人民的创造力开始显露出来。对于我们人民共和国的工作，经济和文化各方面的成就，前任国民议会作了极重大的贡献。在奠定社会主义的基础和发展国民经济的成就上，都证明了我国伟大的工人阶级的觉悟，他们的坚毅和自我牺牲的精神。掌握着政权的匈牙利工人阶级是我国社会主义的先锋和主力，事实已证明他们能够担当自己当前的历史任务，并且在一切艰难困苦的面前，在敌人的威胁和利诱下，都能够坚定地站稳自己的立场。我国工人阶级是我们在建设中的社会主义国家主要的支柱和基础。
    我国勤劳的农民对于我们的一切成就也有相当的贡献，当他们遭遇天灾、不幸和困难的时候，他们仍然忠诚地拥护人民共和国，他们对于未来满怀着希望和信心，正在收获他们辛勤劳动的果实。我国工人阶级和农民对国家的忠诚坚定，应当受到我们深深的感激和谢意。我们的一切成就要归功于我们的党——匈牙利劳动人民党，它站在工人阶级的最前列，领导着我们劳动人民，走上建设社会主义的宽广大道。
    我们最有价值的宝藏是我们的自由，它是我们一切成就的来源。因为有了自由，我们的工人阶级和农民才能完成历史的使命，消灭我国历来的落后，废除古老的剥削制度。自由打开了通向社会主义的道路。自由解放了我国人民的创造力，以我们历史上最辉煌的成绩来使我们国家富强。苏联人民以自己子弟的鲜血作代价，为我们带来了这自由，使我们能够建立一个自由独立的国家，能为我国劳动人民创造繁荣幸福的生活。因此，我们的一切成功和业绩都要归功于苏联——各小国人民的无私的朋友，和平与自由的堡垒。
    解放在我们面前展开了建设一个进步的和社会主义新国家的前途。但是，如果不是得到苏联全面的大力帮助，我们就不可能靠自己的力量和资源来进行巨大的工作，在我们建设社会主义的伟大工作上，在改进劳动人民的物质生活上，苏联都依照经济上互助合作的原则，给我们难以估价的帮助。因此，当我们今天谈到自己的成就时，我们也要表示对苏联人民和苏联政府的诚挚感谢。
    在我们的宪政生活上，在人民共和国的进步上，国民议会的每一次召开都是清除旧制度的经济政治的根基、巩固国家的重建、进步、和平与独立途中的里程碑。
    五月十七日所选出来的本届国民议会更发挥了代表人民的民主原则，更加强了它与政权所有者——劳动人民不可分的联系，它的基础比上届国民议会更加稳固了。这一事实使本届国民议会的任务及其精神以及它在我们宪法生活上所负的使命都有了新的符合人民利益的内容。我们很可以说，本届国民议会的会议标志了我们发展上的一个新阶段。在这一阶段中，人民的主权及国民议会在管理国务、决定负责政府的基本原则与目标，和行使国民议会的合法权利上所起的巨大作用，都将更明确地表现出来。
    政府在履行其职责时，将在更大限度内依靠国民议会。政府受国民议会的委托来管理国家，在一切行政工作，国家的祸福及人民的繁荣等方面，政府都将对国民议会充分负责。同时，政府希望部长会议由于国民议会的帮助，成为有充分权力来管理国家事务的机构，它是基于各部的更广阔的职权及各部长的更大的责任上的。这是我们在国家生活民主化的道路上又前进了一大步。
    在发展我国国民经济的时候必须考虑到我国的经济资源
    当谈到经济政策的问题时，我愿意强调指出，政府是根据切实的目标和匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会的新指示来执行经济政策的。即是说，在发展我国国民经济的时候，政府必须把国家经济资源估计在内，不应当为自己规定一些没有必要条件来实现的任务，无论是原料或投资超出了国家所能负担，或是其他有损于人民生活水平的过高的经济任务。在经济政策方面，政府将遵守“量布裁衣”这句格言。可是，这是必须明确，而且也必须在全国的面前坦白承认的：扩大了的五年计划的目标，在许多方面都超出了我们的资源力量所能达到的范围，过度地使用了我们的能力，妨碍了物质生活基础的增长。尤其是在最近使得生活标准降低了。显然，在这一点上必须有重大的修改。发展社会主义工业的目的不是就为了发展本身。我们沿着人民民主的道路、沿着社会主义工业化的道路向社会主义前进，必须设法使劳动人民的生活水平不断提高，必须更好地满足劳动人民的社会和文化需要，首先是社会主义建设的主力——工人阶级的需要。政府的经济政策最主要的任务之一就是：按照国家的潜力，按照国民经济发展的速度，按照我们的投资，作全面的大量减缩。政府将在生产与投资两方面修改国民经济计划，并将拟定草案，以便把总的计划作相应的紧缩。
    国民经济发展的趋向也必须修改。我们没有理由实行过分的工业化，没有理由来追求工业上的自足自给，当我们没有必要的原料贮备的情况下，尤其不应该这样做。国家的自足自给意味着经济上的孤立，意味着使国家的潜力负担过重，而且必然会放弃由于参加国际贸易，与资本主义国家进行贸易，尤其是目前与苏联、人民民主国家和中国之间现有经济互助与合作所能获得的好处。政府的经济政策更要斟酌资源的力量，减轻国民经济的负担。
    我们在这方面的经济政策方针也必须改变：必须比过去更着重发展生产日用必需品的轻工业与食品工业，要大大地降低制造生产资料的重工业发展的速度，采取步骤使人民日益高涨的需要得到更大的满足。
    关于国民经济的两大部门——工业和农业方面的经济政策也要更改。由于过渡的工业化，特别是重工业发展得太快，需要大规模的投资，因而使国家的物资不足以供农业的发展。结果，因为工业——首先，几乎仅仅是重工业发展得太快，农业生产就停滞了，因而不能保证满足迅速增长的工业对于原料的需求，和不断增加的产业工人及全人口对食物的需求。为了尽早促成生产方面最大可能的繁荣，政府认为它的最重要的任务之一是要大量增加农业的投资，同时减缩工业的投资。
    在我们经济计划中所要施行的巨大变更，即着重降低社会主义工业化的速度与增加农业的发展，反映了政府经济政策的目标：要不断地提高劳动人民——首先是工人阶级的生活水平。
    工业生产速度的改变和与其有关的投资的重新部署，以及拟定新的生产及投资计划都需要有远见的彻底工作。根据政府所决定的原则，尽速来执行这项工作，这是国家计划局要负起主要责任的，并且要设法使工业的重新组织不受障碍，保证生产继续进行，同时要严守劳动纪律，努力保证完成任务。
    这是完全必要的，因为完成工业生产计划是政府要执行经济政策及提高生活水平的一切措施必要的先决条件。如果工业计划没有完全完成，发展农业生产是不可能的。因此，要使政府的目标得以成功地实现，关键在于工人阶级。这就是说两方面都要负责，一方面，政府必须采取必要的措施，提高工人阶级的生活水平，很好地满足其物质的、社会的、文化的需要——政府决定着手这件工作，并且一定要完成它；另一方面，工人阶级应按照计划，加强劳动纪律，保证完成生产任务。我们的工人应当遵守计划，准备这样做。我相信他们将光荣地全心全意地担负起这个任务来。
    对于农民的生产和财产的保障
    我们国民经济的另一重要部分是农业。在这一方面，政府正面对着新的任务。由于上述低额的、并且近年来相对地日渐减少的投资，由于忽略了帮助个体农民，由于农业生产合作社缺乏足够的经济和政治基础的加速发展，因此使得农民对于耕作感到不安心，这些原因使农业生产近年来停滞不前。在频繁而且大规模的土地合并中，发生了许多强迫命令的事情，使农民感到不公平，同时使他们遭受严重的经济损失，也是使农业生产停滞的原因。大家知道，我们的农业生产主要是靠小农经济，他们的生产对国家是必需的。而且，他们在农作物生产和牧畜两方面的发展都关系着国家的利益。政府认为鼓励个体农民的生产是首要的任务，政府要帮助他们得到生产资料、工具、化学肥料、优良种籽及其他农业技术上所需的东西。
    政府要尽力保障农民的生产活动和他们的财产。因此，今年禁止进行平常的秋季土地合并，因为这种任意的合并土地妨碍了精耕细作，减低了农民生产的积极性。
    无疑的，农业合作运动的加速及冒进地追求农业生产合作社数量上的增加，使现有的一部分合作社不能获得足够的经济力量来加强组织，这些都是对于农业生产不利的。但是农业合作运动冒进发展的最严重的结果是：有时发生了强迫命令的情形，破坏了自愿加入的原则，这就在劳动农民中引起了极大的不安。结果，妨碍了生产工作的进行，作为改良耕作必需的投资大大地减少了。
    其次，一般所采取对付富农的过分措施使得国家不得不一年年更加顾虑到政府的后备土地的使用，由于农作情况的不安定和困难，这些土地至今尚未耕种。
    根据上述种种，政府认为首先应使农业生产稳定下来，这是当前的急务。为了要给劳动农民保证一切机会，使他们安心耕作，并且消除他们对于强迫加入农业生产合作社的疑虑，政府认为减低农业合作运动的速度是正确的，也是必要的。为了保证严格遵守自愿的原则，农业生产合作社社员如有认为单干耕作于他们更为有利，那么，应当让他们退出。如果大多数的社员希望解散合作社，政府就允许他们解散。同时，政府将继续大力支持合作社，给予贷款和投资，使合作社组织更为巩固，使社员生活日益繁荣，因为政府相信这是促进农民阶级进步的最好方法。政府要准许自由租借土地。如有人愿意把从前献给国家而现在由政府保留作为一部分后备地的土地收回自用，他们可以收回，政府将贷给种籽和机械农具。如有人想向政府租借后备土地，他们可以租借五年，而不是像现在只能用一年。
    政府所计划的办法是适于我们的农业发展的，而农业繁荣发展则是我们经济政策最重要的目标之一。我相信我们的竭诚努力定会获得农民的广泛赞许和拥护。一个毫不犹豫地从过去的错误汲取教训，并勇于改正错误，大力支持农民的工作的政府，深信是可以得到农民的赞许和拥护的。
    在我们经济生活的其他方面，政府也需要改变过去的经济政策。近年来，国家的经济活动已伸展到了某些部门，在那些地方私人企业仍然可能发挥重要作用，并可能更好地满足人民的需要，例如零售贸易和手工业。虽然生产合作社已有了相当的发展，它们尚不能弥补手工业生产的不足。因此，政府许可私人企业存在，并将依法发给营业执照，同时将予以必需的扶助，如供给物资和贷款等。一定要大力发展城乡之间的贸易，为了这个目标，一方面要大量供应工业产品，同时由于丰收，也要供应大量的剩余农产品。
    不断地提高人民的生活水平是我们新的经济政策的主要原则
    我们经济政策的基本原则是要不断地提高人民的生活水平。
    这就是我们发展国民经济和完成计划的主要和最崇高的目的。劳动人民所能接受的、建设社会主义的唯一适当途径，就是提高人民的生活水平，首先是工人阶级的生活水平，要不断地改善他们的物质、文化和社会地位。这是我们全部国民经济的计划和发展中的中心问题，而我们在这一方面—尤其是在有关产业工人方面——犯了严重的错误，亟待加以改正。政府为了这一目的而采取的措施，使工人阶级和人民的主要食品及工业品的消费得以增加。今年可望农产品丰收，这就使政府执行这一工作时较为容易，能供给更多的食物，从而增加职工们的实际工资，一般说，指那些靠工薪生活的人。
    政府决心降低高昂的物价。当丰收完毕，工业生产计划全部完成后，食物供应增加了，就能够降低现在还昂贵的某些食物和工业产品的价格。这一方面的工作，政府决不迟延。我们已经减低了许多季节产品的价格，使之低于一九五一年的水平。我们已保证了在秋收之前就有更多的重要商品如面粉、糖、肉类、油脂等供应市场。在秋收后，将有更进一步的改善和减价。大家知道，在七月初我们已把许多工业产品的价格减低了百分之十五到百分之三十，我们也着手使这些货物的供应丰富而且多样。
    这些措施都说明政府已决心改善为人民供应消费产品的工作，这不仅是诺言，而是已经开始实行的了。我们要加速消费品和食品的制造。今年下半年我们要增加工厂膳食和工厂公共卫生设备的拨款。我们要重订劳动法中的某些条文。作为对付职工的纪律手段的罚金将要取消。
    劳动法关于劳动保护的条款必须无条件地完全遵守，必须保证安全装备并发给营养食物和工作服。如有人挪用工人保健的拨款，必将受到严厉惩罚。为了很好地保障工人的工作能力，必须减少没有理由的额外工作及星期日加班。除了经常的每周休息日，将采取各种措施来保证劳动人民能利用自己工时以外的自由时间。
    我们要以大量投资来改进城乡的公用事业。在一九五四年，我们将拨一笔相当大的款项来修建公寓，并且津贴私人修建住宅。预计一共要修四万组房屋，而一九五三年只修建二万三千组。国家鼓励并且资助矿工们自己修建住宅和宿舍的计划。在布达佩斯，首先是在首都各工人区的公有住宅必须随时修缮，并要在两年内加以改善。要用收入租金的百分之四十来作修缮费用，要加速修理，这个数目是一九五二年所费的两倍。像这些改善城市居民——首先是产业工人的居住和工作条件的措施是不胜枚举的。
    我们也要大力改善农村居民的生活条件。除了上面说到的对于农业生产的帮助，为了改善牲畜的健康，我们要实行兽医免费服务的办法。这不仅可以为农民节省大部开支，也将促进畜牧业的发展。无疑的，我们农民将衷心欢迎这一措施。我们将停止强制的生产合同，要用特别的优待并供应更多的工业产品来创造条件，使农民知道按合同生产是有利的，因而乐于这样做。为了保证供给农村日益增加的需求，全国合作总社必须大量增加农村地区供销合作社的货品。要有质量优良的各种货物来满足农民的需要。
    我们将再次审查农业生产合作社所欠国家的到期未付的债务，并将减免一大部分。此外，个体农民和生产合作社由于未能交付国家所征购的农产品而被科的赔偿费，并不是时时都公平合理的，这也要给予减免，这一笔款项总数约为六亿福林。
    我们将简化缴纳农产品的手续。我们将实现匈牙利人民独立阵线告选民书所作的诺言。在明年即将实施的农产品缴纳的新制度中，我们将预先规定数年的缴纳额，以便劳动农民能够事先知道要上缴多少，能够在自由市场上出售剩余的产品，可以安心生产。
    为了有效地帮助个体农民和农业生产合作社，为了在最短期内有成果地克服由于去年严重的霜灾所引起的困难，凡是按期缴纳今年的粮食秣草的人，政府将免征他过去所滞缴的数目。
    上述的各种措施清楚地说明了政府并不是吝啬的，说明了政府是最愿意帮助人民的。毫无疑义，我们并不是说空话，而是要准确地充分地完成我们在全国人民面前所承担起来的任务，我们一定遵守诺言，这是近数年来匈牙利人民屡次亲自看见的。政府是居心无愧的，它有权利期望——事实上要求个体农民和生产合作社及时完全缴纳他们应交给国家的农产品和税额。因此，个体农民和生产合作社都必须履行他们的公民义务。这是法律规定的义务，政府一定要使之遵守的。谁要是以蔑视国家的利益和违犯法律来回答政府的好意和大力援助，那么这只有怪他自己。服从法律制度——政府将制定有效的措施来达到这个目的——不仅是说国家有责任来保护农民的权利不受侵犯，而且也包含农民有履行他们缴纳农产品和税款给国家的义务。另一方面，凡是忠实地完成了缴纳农产品的义务的人决不应再负担任何的附加税额。这是法律明文规定的，谁要是在法定义务之外去给农民增加负担，他将受到最严厉的惩罚。
    知识分子在我们人民民主国家中应该受到尊重
    我们国民经济的两个主要部门即工业和农业，是我国两大密切合作的阶级——工人阶级和农民的活动范围，知识分子也参加了这两个主要部门的工作，并且在我国文化生活中担负着重要的任务。但是很不幸，智力工作和一般知识分子——尤其是旧知识分子，仍没有受到应有的重视——政府愿意努力改变这种现象——他们常常被不信任的气氛所包围。结果，当我们的经济、文化、科学生活几乎每一方面都缺乏有经验和受过训练的知识分子的时候，不信任的气氛却使得我们轻视他们。我们国民经济的社会主义发展为他们的活动提供了极广阔的范围，但是，由于不信任或是不适当的清洗，善良的知识分子被人用一种人民共和国不应该有的方法来对待，他们被剥夺了利用他们的专业知识来为国家服务的机会，这是屡见不鲜的事。政府将用坚强的手腕来制止这种不合适并且不能容忍的行为，并且要在凡是应该弥补的地方来补救这种过失。知识分子应当是我们人民共和国中受到尊敬的人，无论他们是教员、工程师、法学家、医生、农艺学家或其他的人，都应当在他们那一行享有受人尊重的地位。每一个人都必须理解，在人民民主国家里面，教育和知识比过去——旧制度下受到更高的尊崇。这种尊重必须用广泛的任用机会和物质的报酬一起来表示。
    我们的教育制度在训练年青的新知识分子方面也有过火的地方。我们作了巨大的牺牲来推行强迫高等教育。现在我们在这一方面也必须更切合实际一些。我们不应当架起空中楼阁，我们必须比过去更多注意小学校，必须增加小学经费，添办更多的小学，增加校舍和教师，以保证我们匈牙利年青的一代——未来的希望受到最好的初等教育。我们必须承认，由于过分的注重大学教育，我们忽略了这些。此外，对于农村及工厂中的学校，必须更加注意，更加关怀，给予更多的经费。这样才能促成更民主的教育政策。
    在宗教问题上应当更加宽容。在这方面不许像过去那样有时使用行政的手段。在这问题上，政府赞成容忍的原则，要用启发和教育的方法，禁止使用行政和其他强迫手段。
    巩固法律制度是政府的重要任务之一
    政府在其一切活动中都是基于宪法所制定的法律秩序和法律制度的。我们人民民主制度，我们经济和社会生活的基础，就在于社会主义的法律制度，在于严守宪法所规定的公民权利与义务，和人民共和国的法律。政府正面对着修正严重的错误，巩固法律秩序与保证法律制度的重大任务。国家政权机关的任务和职责是保卫我们劳动人民权利的不受侵犯。这些机关的任务不仅是在于保证劳动人民履行自己的义务，而更在于使每一个公民能自由地享受合法的权利。我们的劳动人民完全有理由向国家指望这些权利。但是，在我们的司法机关和公安机关及地方代表会议的工作中，常常没有充分遵守法律制度——这是一个人民民主国家施政的基本原则。这些机关不仅是在国家的，经济的和社会的生活方面，甚至就是在自己的工作中也不能按照人民民主国家和人民的利益所绝对要求的那样来严格遵守法律制度。
    对于有许多问题不大的违法案件，广泛地使用着行政手段。在征购、征税、登记富农、小土地合并方面的许多过火行为和滥用职权等，使人民感到不平，动摇了他们对于法律制度的信仰，也削弱了劳动人民和国家机关及地方代表会议的联系。
    我们机关中个别官僚主义者对于一般前来洽办自己的事情的普通公民所采取的不可容忍的、粗暴冷酷和毫无心肝的态度，应当受到严正的批评。这些官僚主义者甚至于把正确的、公正的和合法措施也执行成为反而使人民生活痛苦的了。他们忘了他们是为人民服务，而不是人民为他们服务。谦逊的、通达人情的态度——这些品质都是无论那一个公民和政府所合理地要求于我们机关的每一个工作人员的。
    巩固法律制度是政府最迫切的任务之一。它将以严峻的手段，如果这还无补于事，则采取严厉的惩罚，以彻底根除错误和缺点，以求在短期间做到使司法、公安机关与地方代表会议能成为国家、人民、法律制度和法律秩序的坚强支持与保证。它们应该更好地保护我们劳动人民的利益，更加警惕地保卫我们国家的安全，与人民团结一致，更有力地和我们的人民民主制度的死敌进行斗争，这些死敌是必须依法严厉制裁的。我们不能给敌人以任何立足之点和喘息的时机，因为他们图谋破坏我们的成果、我们的独立和自由。
    但是我们也知道，有些误入歧途的人，由于他们的或多或少的罪行而受到司法机关的追究。也有些人是受了委曲，他们可能是冤枉的，因为我们的政权机关常常不遵守宪法上保障公民权利、个人自由及安全的规定。拘留制度本身也促成了违犯法律制度，无疑地，我们没有执行人民共和国宪法的指示，没有建立作为宪法所规定的法律秩序和法律制度捍卫者的最高检察署，也是使这一切发生的一个因素。现在我们已做到了这一点。
    由于所有这一切，本着宽大的精神，为了平息和根本消除许多合理的不平，政府将向国民议会提出一项法令草案。根据这一法令，将要释放所有虽曾犯过罪行，但案情并不严重，释放他们不会危及国家与社会秩序的人。同时，政府将废除拘留制度，并取消拘留营。同样地，政府拟提供一切可能，使获得大赦者和被拘留过的人能够回到自己的家里去，回到社会中去，并且通过他们的工作使自己成为对于社会有益的成员。政府也打算安顿那些被遣送到别处去的人，按照适用于所有的公民的法律条例，给予他们为自己选择居住地点的可能。
    人民民主的司法基本原则是和侦察机关本质上同时也可以宣判的警察司法不相容的。政府拟通过立法的途径，将这一自旧社会制度遗留下来的残余予以清除。
    政府对于在坚固的工农联盟的政治与经济的基础上来确定对于农民的态度，对于恢复农民对于法律秩序和法律制度的信心，赋予特别重大的意义，因为在促使农民的信心的动摇上，所谓登记富农的办法，是一个不小的因素。此外，这一种登记办法已进而至于用行政命令手段和严重的滥用职权去反对富农，而且也削弱了政府和劳动农民之间的良好关系。很明显的，假如我们要消灭农村中的违法乱纪，假如我们要恢复法律秩序和与中农的坚固联盟——而且我们无论如何应当这样做——那么富农登记的办法一定要废除，同时坚持限制富农剥削者的经济措施。
    广大人民群众的积极参加是我们成就的主要保证
    我们在改造国民经济和巩固法律秩序以及提高生活水平方面的许多具有重大意义的措施，我们在经济生活各方面目前面对着的，和即将贯彻的巨大变革，都给予国民议会、政府和全部国家机构以重大的任务。而这些措施还远没有包括政府在国家生活一切方面的全部工作。我不打算详谈细节了。已谈到的许多主要问题已很清楚地表明了政府经济政策的新道路：就是在更广泛的基础上，和全体人民一起前进，起初可能走得慢些，但是更有信心地走向一个不变的目标——走向社会主义。
    匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会向政府所提出的那些建议，是全民最广泛团结的纲领。凭藉这一个纲领，我们可以使所有的创造力量和才能都为我们祖国的繁荣和人民幸福的增长而服务。这些目标能够使我们的劳动人民比过去更加紧密地团结在自己政府的周围。这就是政府施政纲领的巨大力量。有了这种力量，我们就可以着手完成比大选时期匈牙利人民独立阵线告选民书中所保证的更重大的任务。我们将使所有这些目标和任务的实现，都为我们人民和祖国的利益而服务。毫无疑问，全国人民将以欢快的心情来迎接我们这些工作。政府有责任使劳动人民尽快地从生活条件的改善中得到实际的好处。我们的工人阶级、农民、知识分子都应当明白地了解：政府的措施和办法将使他们的情况引起深刻的变化。如果我们顺利地实现这些措施，我们就会给我们的敌人以近年来最沉重的打击。
    显然这些任务并不是轻易就能完成的，也不会自然而然地就完成了。必须看到，成功的最重要的保证是在于广大群众的积极参加。但是同时也必须看到，一定会有些人不能够或是不愿意去掉专横过火的不民主精神，不愿意放弃行政命令手段，并将尽力阻碍人民福利措施的迅速顺利实现。政府正警惕地准备着用国家机构的权力，迅速而坚决地制止这类恶毒的企图。
    敌人将尽力就我们的新经济政策和有关的措施制造谣言，以此迷惑人民。但是有一件事实是他们所不能置驳的，这就是最广大的各阶层人民将欢欣赞许地迎接这一政策，并且拥护这一政策。这就注定了敌人所有的扰乱和破坏企图一开始就要破产。
    丰收的希望是我们实行这些措施的有利条件。假如我们现在将主要的注意力集中在收获、打谷和征购等巨大的工作上，并为完成这些任务而积极努力，则大部分经济措施的顺利实现已经可以说是有了保证。
    我们今天准备实行的施政纲领，给我们的社会主义建设翻开了新的一章。我们每一个目标都是为崇高的和平事业而服务的。新的任务和它们的实现所造成的光辉前途增强了我们人民的力量和为和平斗争的意志。我国经济力量的增长、我们人民生活的提高，大大地巩固了整个和平战线上我国这一部分。因此我可以大胆地说，实现政府规定的许多方案，就其本身意义来说，已不只是我国的事情，而是整个和平阵营的共同事业。
    世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议是爱好和平与自由的人民国际团结的伟大表现。来到我国的代表们可以看到我国人民和平的创造性的劳动、他们卓越的成就和捍卫伟大的和平事业到底的决心。最近期间，全世界和平、民主和社会主义力量是大大地增长了，意大利六月七日的选举给意大利共产党和工人阶级带来了巨大的胜利。要是没有意大利共产党和劳动人民的积极参加，解决意大利日益加深的政治危机，稳定动荡不定的国内情况，都是不可能的。
    连续数周的法国内政危机也表现出共产党与工人阶级力量的增长和侵略者阵营的削弱，同时也加深了帝国主义者内部的矛盾。战争贩子们正急欲以冒险行为和卑鄙的挑衅为自己寻找出路。李承晚阻挠朝鲜停战、拒绝交出应该遣返的战俘的罪行，无耻的柏林挑衅事件——所有这些，都是侵略者一连串卑鄙阴谋中的一些环节。帝国主义雇佣分子在柏林的挑衅事件，是反动派和法西斯力量向人民的和平与安全的一次袭击。和平敌人的挑衅阴谋是为了要阻碍国际紧张局势的缓和。柏林事件又一次明显地表示出，和平的死敌是会进行最下流的挑衅的，为了达到目的，他们不惜使用最卑鄙的手段。但尽管这样，德国人民民主与爱国力量还是阻挡了法西斯的道路，这表明了从西德来的侵略是可以遏止的。在柏林所发生的事件，唤起了我们的警惕，并且警告了所有爱好和平的人民，他们一分钟也不可忘掉敌人的阴谋。为了使侵略者恶毒的计划遭受到可耻的失败，诚实的、爱好和平的人们应该以极大的决心来进行保卫与巩固和平的事业。为了击退敌人的袭击，我们应该更紧密地团结自己的队伍——这是我们所有珍视伟大和平事业的人们的任务。
    政府在所有的活动中，都依靠着我们人民要求和平的不可摧毁的意志。在其为保卫和平的努力中，政府遵循着与各国爱好和平人民的团结和对于世界和平的先锋队——伟大的苏联的真挚友谊这一原则的。
    政府的施政纲领明显地表示出我们是在努力争取持久和平。本着各国人民友好的精神，我们希望对于各族人民间日益加强的经济合作，对于他们间的和平共居的关系的巩固能竭尽自己微薄的力量有所贡献。同时，我们也坚决捍卫着我们的独立和国家主权。我们的力量之所以增强，因为我们不是孤单的，因为我们有着苏联的支持和帮助，因为我们是不可战胜的世界和平阵营中的一个成员。
    我感谢你们对于我的信任，把我提名为部长会议的领导者。我深感在祖国与人民之前的责任重大。我要强调地指出，我们人民的福利、工人阶级和全体人民生活水平的经常提高——这是政府工作的中心——是基于我们人民的生产劳动的。只有提高生产、完成计划、广泛地开展劳动人民热烈的社会主义竞赛，才能在工业与农业中保证有用以繁荣物质生活的充分的货物。今天，全国人民的注意力都集中在这个会议上，会议所要作出的决定是我们全体人民所迫切期待着的。我确信，充满对自己祖国的责任感的我国劳动人民——工人阶级、农民和知识分子将会达到我们规定的目标的。
    我坚决相信，根据匈牙利劳动人民党的建议，在它的领导之下，为了实现我们的新经济政策的目标，我们将和全国人民团结一致，比一向更有信心地沿着使我国繁荣、使人民幸福的道路，向着光辉的未来，向着社会主义前进。
