Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 4th. The Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a decision on July 30 regarding the restoration and reconstruction of Pyongyang.

The Cabinet decided that the restoration and reconstruction of Pyongyang should eliminate the decadent content expressed in the architecture of the past Japanese imperialist rule for the enjoyment and benefit of the privileged class, and create a new democratic capital for the safety and welfare of the working people.

The basic guidelines for restoring and rebuilding Pyongyang are: to preserve the urban foundation historically formed in Pyongyang, appropriately allocate residential areas, industrial areas, and transportation networks, and correctly organize residential areas to ensure healthy conditions for the normal life of urban residents.

The overall plan for restoring and rebuilding Pyongyang will be implemented over a period of ten to twenty years, with the first phase of restoration lasting three years; the population of Pyongyang will grow to approximately one million; a central administrative square will be established, covering an area of 360 acres; Stalin Avenue (45 meters wide and 2.5 kilometers long) will be rebuilt as a straight line; the Central Grand Theater will be built on the square, and a statue of Comrade Stalin will be erected; Victory Tower will be built on Namsan Mountain to symbolize the victory over the American invaders; designated basic industrial areas will be established, and urban transportation will be improved; residential areas will be greened, reducing the building density from 85-90% to 20-25%; the living area for the working people will be expanded from 1-2 square meters per person to 6-9 square meters; theaters, cinemas, clubs, schools, libraries, nurseries, kindergartens, hospitals, clinics, shops, and government agencies will be evenly distributed throughout the city; parks and vegetable gardens will be added, and sanitary protection zones and windbreak zones will be established to isolate industrial areas; water supply, heating, gas, electricity, and communication networks will be restored and developed according to a common underground network plan; various flood control, drainage, and epidemic prevention facilities will be established.

The decision stipulates that a Pyongyang Restoration and Reconstruction Committee will be formed under the guidance of Premier Kim Il-sung, including Park Jung-ai, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, heads of relevant government departments, party and government leaders of Pyongyang, as well as builders and representatives of the Scientific Consultation Council.

The decision points out that Pyongyang has been brutally destroyed due to the barbaric atrocities of the American armed invaders. Valuable national relics with a long history and industrial and cultural facilities built after liberation have been almost completely destroyed and burned. These atrocities of the invaders have once again clearly exposed them as vicious enemies of progress and culture, and have aroused infinite indignation among the entire Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world. The Korean people, with unparalleled enthusiasm, are eager to restore and build Pyongyang—the center that infinitely inspired and promoted their patriotic strength during the Fatherland Liberation War, and at the same time was the guiding force for their victory in the struggle for the motherland—into a more beautiful city in a very short period of time.

The decision emphasizes that involving the entire people in the restoration work of Pyongyang will most effectively consolidate the achievements we have made in this heroic era, create the necessary conditions to meet the living and material needs of the residents, and set an example for the restoration of all cities in the Republic.

    朝鲜内阁决定恢复和重建平壤市
    【新华社平壤四日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁在七月三十日发布关于恢复和重建平壤市的决定。
    内阁决定：平壤的恢复、重建，应肃清过去日本帝国主义统治时代为特权阶级的享乐和利益而表现在建筑中的颓废的内容，创造为劳动人民的生活安全和福利的新的民主首都。
    恢复、再建平壤市的基本方针是：保存平壤市在历史上形成的城市的基础，适当地配置住宅区、工业区及交通网，正确组织住宅区，以保障城市居民的正常生活的健康条件。
    恢复和重建平壤市的总计划实施时期为十年到二十年，第一阶段恢复期间为三年；平壤市人口将要增长到约一百万名；设置中心行政广场，面积为三百六十公亩；重建成直线的斯大林大道（宽四十五公尺，长二·五公里）；在广场上建筑中央大剧场，竖立斯大林同志的铜像；在南山建筑胜利塔，象征击败美国侵略者的胜利；设置预定的基本工业地区，改进市内交通；绿化住宅区，使建筑物所占密度由百分之八十五—九十降低到百分之二十—二十五；扩大劳动人民居住领域的面积，使由每人占地一—二平方公尺增至六—九平方公尺；在全市平均配置剧场、电影院、俱乐部、学校、图书馆、托儿所、幼儿园、医院、诊疗所、商店及政权机关等；添设公园、菜园、设置隔离工业区的卫生防护地带及防风地带；以共同地下网的计划来恢复、发展水道、暖气、煤气、电气和通讯网；建立防洪、排水、防疫的各种设施。
    决定规定：在内阁首相金日成的指导下，组成平壤市恢复重建委员会，委员包括朝鲜劳动党中央委员会书记朴正爱和政府有关部门首长、平壤市的党政领导人以及建筑者和科学协议会代表。
    决定指出：由于美国武装侵略者的野蛮暴行，平壤市遭到了残酷的破坏。有着悠久历史的宝贵的民族遗物和在解放后建设起来的工业和文化设施，几乎完全被破坏和焚烧。侵略者的这些暴行，再一次清楚地暴露了他们是进步和文化的恶毒敌人，并激起了朝鲜全体人民和全世界爱好和平人民的无限激愤。朝鲜人民以无比的热情，迫切地要把平壤市——这个在祖国解放战争中无限地鼓舞与推动了他们的爱国力量，同时是他们争取祖国的胜利的向导力量的中心地，在很短的时期内恢复、建设成为更美好的城市。
    决定强调说：使全体人民参加平壤市的恢复工作，将最有效地巩固我们在英雄的时代所取得的成果，创造为满足居民生活和物质要求的必要条件，并将作出恢复共和国一切都市的榜样。
