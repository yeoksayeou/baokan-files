    Northeast District Transportation Company Inspects and Rectifies Work of Anshan City Company
    Letter from the Northeast District Transportation Company: The "Excerpts from Readers' Letters" column on June 6th published a letter from workers of the Anshan City Transportation Company exposing the company's chaotic situation. After our investigation, the situation reflected in the reader's letter is completely accurate. The past chaotic situation of the Anshan City Company was extremely serious, and the correct policy of organizing public and private transportation forces to serve national construction and urban-rural material exchange was not implemented at all. In terms of organizing mass transportation forces: on the one hand, there was a phenomenon of restricting private vehicle owners from finding work; on the other hand, many cadres condoned vehicle owners demanding excessive freight charges, disobeying dispatch, and stealing. In terms of the operation of state-owned vehicles, waste and losses were extremely serious. Quota management and planning management were not done at all. Fuel consumption exceeded the central quota by 30%. The waste and losses caused by the lack of quota management in other aspects, such as tire usage and repair man-hours and materials, are difficult to estimate. National plans were never discussed with workers, work efficiency was very low, and the vehicle utilization rate was less than 50%. The phenomenon of no one being responsible for vehicle maintenance was extremely serious. For example, last winter, the cylinders of six vehicles were cracked due to the water not being drained from the water tanks; there were also many incidents of vehicles being out of service waiting for materials due to the untimely supply of materials, sometimes even for ten and a half days due to the lack of a tire bolt or spring bolt. This year, the city's transportation tasks are quite heavy, but the company completely stopped work and rested on Sundays, and usually couldn't complete one day's work in two days; the cargo owners were very anxious, but the company remained indifferent. In addition, the empty mileage losses caused by the company's poor communication with cargo owners and failure to implement the district company's regulations on "mutual organization of return cargo among brother companies" are countless. According to very incomplete estimates, the net loss caused by the poor management of state-owned vehicles in the past six months exceeded 1.3 billion. In addition, the company lacks the necessary rules and regulations, the division of labor in each department is unclear, there is no coordination between them, and the phenomena of disorganization and indiscipline are extremely serious, and labor discipline is lax, almost to the point of being unmanageable.
    The reasons for such a chaotic situation are of course multifaceted, but the main reason is that the company's leadership lacks a sense of responsibility for the revolution, has extremely poor principles, and lacks a democratic style and the idea of relying on the working class to run the enterprise well; therefore, it has no prestige among the workers and even forms a state of opposition to the workers. In addition, the company's higher-level leading departments—the Northeast District Company and the Anshan City Construction Bureau—lack leadership and supervision of the company's work, which has also prevented the problem from being resolved for a long time.
    Now, the work team dispatched by the relevant leading organs, after deeply mobilizing the masses, focusing on the operation of state-owned vehicles, improving labor organization, implementing national plans, and establishing and improving various necessary systems, is guiding all employees to carry out a comprehensive production reform movement with emphasis and step-by-step. With the replacement of the company's leading cadres, the adjustment and enrichment of department personnel, and the timely distribution of labor protection equipment, the enthusiasm of employees for production has been greatly improved. From the start of the "Safety, Four Determinations, 2,000 Ton-Kilometers per Vehicle-Ton Month" competition on June 11th, the results of the vehicle-ton-day production for the ten days after the competition, converted to vehicle-ton-month production, should be 1,078 ton-kilometers (including two days when vehicles were not dispatched due to rain, and if excluded from the calculation, it should be 1,300 ton-kilometers), an increase of 64% compared to the average vehicle-ton-month production in the first quarter, and an increase of 11% compared to the average vehicle-ton-month production in April and May. In terms of fuel consumption, many vehicles have reached the verified quota, and some have even broken through the central quota. This shows that the company has now broken away from the chaotic state and is beginning to show a new atmosphere. However, it should be pointed out that the problems that existed in the company in the past have not been fully resolved, and the long-term lax labor discipline has not been fundamentally reversed; therefore, it is still necessary to vigorously strengthen political and ideological leadership in the future and further mobilize the masses to work hard to run the state-owned enterprise well.

### 东北区运输公司检查和整顿鞍山市公司工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    东北区运输公司检查和整顿鞍山市公司工作
    东北区运输公司来信：六月六日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了鞍山市运输公司工人揭发该公司混乱现象的来信。经我们检查，读者来信所反映的情况是完全正确的。鞍山市公司过去混乱情况极端严重，正确组织公私运输力量为国家建设和城乡物资交流而服务的方针根本没有得到贯彻。在组织群众运输力量方面：一方面有着限制私人车户拉活的现象；另一方面又有着不少干部纵容车户多要运费、不服从调配和偷东西的现象。在国营车辆经营方面，浪费亏损现象极为严重。定额管理、计划管理工作根本没有做，燃料消耗倒超过中央定额百分之三十，其他如轮胎使用和修理工时、工料等因无定额管理造成的浪费损失尚难统计。国家计划也从不交工人讨论，工作效率非常低，工作车率还不到百分之五十。车辆保修方面的无人负责现象极严重，如去年冬季曾有六台车的汽缸因水箱没放净水而冻裂；材料供应工作不及时而造成的停车待料事件也很多，有时甚至仅因缺一轮胎螺丝、车弓螺丝也要停车待料十天半月。今年该市运输任务相当繁重，该公司竟在星期日全部停车休息，平时两天干不了一天活；货主很焦急，该公司却处之泰然。另外由于该公司与货主联系不周以及没有执行区公司规定“兄弟公司间互相组织回货办法”而造成的空驶损失也不胜枚举。半年来国营车辆经营管理不力所造成的浪费损失，据极不完全的估计，净损失超过十三亿。此外，公司内部缺乏应有的章则制度，各科分工不清，互不配合，无组织、无纪律现象极端严重，劳动纪律松弛，几乎已到难以收拾的地步。
    产生这样混乱局面的原因固然是多方面的，但主要是该公司领导方面缺乏对革命的责任心，原则性极差，缺乏民主作风和依靠工人阶级搞好企业的思想；因此，在工人群众当中没有威信，甚至形成和工人群众对立的状态。此外，该公司的上级领导部门——东北区公司和鞍山市建设局——对该公司的工作缺乏领导和检查，也使问题长期得不到解决。
    现在，各有关领导机关派遣的工作组经过深入发动群众，以国营车辆经营为中心，改善劳动组织，贯彻国家计划，建立与健全各种必要的制度，引导全体职工有重点、有步骤地进行全面生产改革运动。随着公司领导干部的撤换，科室人员的调整、充实，劳动保护用具的及时发给，职工生产积极性已经大为提高。从六月十一日开展“安全、四定、车吨月产两千吨公里”竞赛运动算起，竞赛后十天车吨日产成绩换算为车吨月产应为一千零七十八吨公里（内有两天因雨未出车，如剔除计算则应为一千三百吨公里）较第一季度平均车吨月产提高百分之六十四，较四、五两月份平均车吨月产提高百分之十一。在燃料消耗上不少车辆达到查定定额，有的还突破中央定额。这说明该公司目前已摆脱混乱状态，开始出现了新气象。但是应该指出：该公司过去存在的问题还没有全面解决，劳动纪律长期松弛的情况还没有根本扭转；因此，今后还必须大力加强政治思想领导，进一步发动群众为搞好国家企业而努力。
