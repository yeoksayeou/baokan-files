    Our Great Motherland
    The Sanhe Sluice, the largest sluice gate in the Huai River project, was successfully completed on July 25th after ten months of intense construction, and a water release ceremony was held on the 26th. The completion of this project not only ended the historical flood disasters in the lower reaches of the Huai River, but also began to play a huge role in irrigation and navigation. This is the situation after the gate was opened, and the water from Hongze Lake was introduced into the new river channel.

    淮河工程中的最大水闸——三河闸，经过十个月的紧张施工后，已于七月二十五日胜利完工，并于二十六日举行放水典礼。这个工程的完成，不但结束了淮河下游历史性的洪水灾害，并且对于灌溉、航运都开始发生巨大作用。这是闸门开放后，洪泽湖的水流被引入新河道的情形。
