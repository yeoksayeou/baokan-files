Liujiadian Village in the Eleventh District of Pingquan County, Rehe Province, has seen its mutual aid teams consistently forming in the spring, only to disintegrate somewhat in the summer and autumn, with few persisting. However, the summer and autumn seasons are precisely the busiest times for agriculture, and disbanding is highly detrimental to production. This year, in order to ensure the smooth completion of the autumn harvest, the Party and government leading cadres of Liujiadian Village have learned from past experiences and provided special assistance to the mutual aid teams during the slack season for farming. The rectification process identified the reasons for the mutual aid teams' disbandment and solutions to these problems.

The Wang Huashan mutual aid team is a typical example from this rectification. This team consists of seventeen households, and they encountered many problems during the hoeing season: such as unreasonable arrangements for the order of work; a lack of planning for work allocation; the team's work points were too low and not settled on time. The team leader's leadership ability was weak, and he did not discuss and solve problems with everyone. These factors all caused dissatisfaction among the team members, and were also some of the reasons for the dissolution of mutual aid teams in the past.

After identifying these problems during the rectification, everyone discussed how to solve these problems during the autumn harvest. Finally, the following system was established:

(1) Based on past experience, when the crops are ripe, no one wants to harvest them as long as there is still a hint of green, and when there are strong winds and rain, everyone wants to harvest first. This often leads to quarrels and even disbandment. This year, to avoid quarrels, it was decided to divide the thirteen laborers in the team into three groups (or four groups if necessary), and harvest the ripest ones first. In addition, based on the type of crop, early or late ripening, and ease of being affected by wind, plans for five to seven days were made to ensure harvesting according to plan. This can generally overcome the contradiction of harvesting first or last. (2) Mobilize the women laborers and those who can work in the fields in the team to participate in the harvest to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor during the busy farming season. (3) It is stipulated that the work points of the mutual aid team are equal to the work points outside, and the work points are settled together every seven days. In this way, households with little land and a lot of labor will not go out to work elsewhere.

(4) Strengthen leadership and elect Wang Hanting as deputy team leader to assist Wang Huashan in his work. Fully promote democracy, and discuss and solve problems at meetings.

Village cadres used the experience of rectifying this team to rectify other teams as well. Currently, all teams are united and preparing for the autumn harvest.

### 热河平泉刘家店村准备秋收

    热河平泉刘家店村准备秋收
    热河省平泉县十一区刘家店村的互助组，历年来总是春天组织起来了，夏天和秋天总有些要散伙，能坚持的没有几个。但夏秋两季正是农忙季节，散伙对生产十分不利。今年刘家店村的党政领导干部为了保证顺利完成秋收工作，接受了往年的教训，在挂锄期间特别帮助各互助组作了一番整顿。从整顿中找出了互助组散伙的原因和解决问题的办法。
    王化山互助组是这次整顿当中的一个典型组。这个互助组共有十七户，今年他们在耪地的时候就发生了不少问题：如干活先后的次序安排得不合理；工作分配没有计划；组内工价太低，又不按时找清。组长的领导能力较弱，有了问题不会和大家讨论解决。这些都造成组员的不满，也是过去互助组解体的一些原因。
    整顿中大家找出了这些问题以后，接着就讨论在秋收中如何解决这些问题的办法。最后，订出了下面的制度：
    （一）根据往年的经验，庄稼熟了的时候，只要还有一点青眼，就谁也不愿割，遇到大风下雨，就谁都要先割。大家往往因此争吵，以致散伙。今年为了避免争吵，决定把组内十三个劳动力分为三组
    （必要时可分为四组），先挑熟透了的割。另外，还根据庄稼的类别、早熟晚熟、容易不容易招风等等条件，作出五天到七天的计划，保证按计划收割。这样，大体上可以克服先割后割的矛盾。（二）动员组内的女劳动力和能下地的人全都下地参加收割，解决农忙时候劳动力不足的困难。（三）规定互助组的工价和外面的工价相等，每七天一齐工找价。这样，地少劳动力多的户也不会出去干活了。
    （四）加强领导，选出王汉廷为副组长，协助王化山工作。充分发扬民主，有事大家开会商量解决。
    村干部以整顿这个组的经验，也整顿了其它的组。目前各组都团结一致，准备秋收。
