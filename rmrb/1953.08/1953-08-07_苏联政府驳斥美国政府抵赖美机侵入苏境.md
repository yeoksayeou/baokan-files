    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th (TASS): As previously reported, the Soviet Government sent a note to the US Government on July 30, protesting the intrusion of a US four-engine B-50 bomber into Soviet airspace near Vladivostok on July 29.
    On July 31, the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Charles Bohlen, acting on instructions from the US Government, delivered a memorandum to the Soviet Foreign Ministry denying that a US military aircraft had violated the Soviet border. The memorandum falsely claimed that the US aircraft was attacked by Soviet fighters while conducting normal flight operations over the Sea of Japan. The memorandum also stated that, according to information received by the US Government, surviving personnel from the US aircraft had been recovered by Soviet vessels, and the US Government therefore requested the Soviet Government to return these personnel to the United States.
    On August 3, the Soviet Foreign Ministry sent a reply to the above-mentioned US memorandum to the US Embassy in the Soviet Union. The reply first reiterated the facts listed in the Soviet Government's note to the US Government on July 30, proving that a US four-engine B-50 bomber intruded into Soviet airspace near Vladivostok on July 29, attacked Soviet aircraft, and fled towards the sea after being fired upon by Soviet aircraft. The reply then stated: The above facts prove that the US Government's memorandum's claim that the US aircraft was attacked by Soviet aircraft while conducting normal flight operations over the Sea of Japan is contrary to the verified facts. The Soviet Government has no information regarding the aforementioned US aircraft that fled towards the sea, nor any information regarding its personnel.
    Reiterating its note of July 30, the Soviet Government firmly demands that those who violated the Soviet border be severely punished, and hopes that the US Government will take measures to prevent future intrusions of Soviet borders by US aircraft.
    The Soviet Government rejects the unfounded protests raised in the US Embassy's memorandum.

    苏联政府驳斥美国政府抵赖美机侵入苏境
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：前已报道，苏联政府曾在七月三十日照会美国政府，抗议美国四引擎B—50型轰炸机一架七月二十九日侵入苏联海参崴附近上空。
    七月三十一日，美国驻苏联大使查·波伦奉美国政府的命令，送交苏联外交部备忘录一件，否认曾有一架美国军用飞机侵犯苏联国境的事实，并硬说该美国飞机在日本海上空作正常飞行时受到苏联战斗机的袭击。该备忘录并指出，根据美国政府所得到的情报，这架美国飞机上的残存的人员已为苏联舰只所获，美国政府因此要求苏联政府把这些人员遣回美国。
    八月三日，苏联外交部向美国驻苏联大使馆致送一份对美国上述备忘录的复文。复文首先重述了苏联政府七月三十日致美国政府照会中所列举的事实，证明美国四引擎B—50型轰炸机一架在七月二十九日侵入苏联海参崴附近上空，袭击苏联飞机，并在苏联飞机还击后向大海方面逃去。复文接着说：上述事实证明美国政府的备忘录中所谓美国飞机在日本海上空作正常飞行时受到苏联飞机的袭击的说法，是与业经证实的事实相违反的。苏联政府没有关于上述这架向大海方向逃去的美国飞机的任何消息，也没有关于它的人员的任何消息。
    苏联政府重申七月三十日的照会，坚决要求严惩侵犯苏联国境的人员，并希望美国政府采取措施防止美国飞机将来再侵犯苏联国境。
    苏联政府驳回美国大使馆的备忘录中所提出的毫无根据的抗议。
