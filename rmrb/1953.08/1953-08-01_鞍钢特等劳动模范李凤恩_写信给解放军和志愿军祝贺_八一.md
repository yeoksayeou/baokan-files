Anshan Iron and Steel's Special-Class Labor Model Li Feng'en
Writes Letter to PLA and Volunteers to Congratulate "August 1st"
    On the eve of the "August 1st" Army Day, Li Feng'en, a special-class labor model of Anshan Iron and Steel, wrote a letter to the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, which reads as follows: Dear Comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    As the "August 1st" Army Day arrives and the Korean Armistice Agreement is signed, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to you—the defenders of the motherland.

    Because you bravely guard the border of the motherland, especially the Volunteers fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, resolutely striking at the American imperialist aggressors, and achieving the great victory of the Korean armistice, you have guaranteed the peaceful life of the people of the motherland and the large-scale construction of our Anshan Iron and Steel.

    As you know, Anshan Iron and Steel's steel production technical indicators have long exceeded the level of the enemy and puppet rule. In recent years, Anshan Iron and Steel has supplied a large amount of steel needed for the motherland's national defense construction and industrial construction. For example, all or part of the heavy rails, light rails, and other steel used to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, and the Huai River harnessing and Jingjiang flood diversion projects were supplied by Anshan Iron and Steel. In the first half of this year, our iron smelting plant over-fulfilled the smelting of a large amount of iron for the country to supply high-quality steel. In terms of infrastructure construction, huge, modern seamless steel pipe plants, large rolling mills, and other projects have been completed in just over a year, and everyone is now busy preparing for production.

    The workers on our iron and steel front have also learned new advanced technologies in accordance with your high patriotism and tenacious fighting spirit. For example, I used to be an illiterate and technically ignorant worker. Earlier, a Japanese engineer said that it would take me eighteen years to learn iron smelting technology. After liberation, the Party trained me to learn technology. In the process of learning, I did encounter many difficulties, but the example of you overcoming difficulties tenaciously gave me the courage to overcome difficulties. In addition to learning from the teacher in the factory every day, after work, I continued to study technology at home at night. When I was sleepy, I poured cold water on my head or pricked my fingertips with needles to refresh myself, often persisting until two o'clock in the morning. Therefore, I learned to master iron smelting technology within six months and was rated as a high-quality technician. Not only myself, but also many ordinary workers in Anshan Iron and Steel have become technical workers or technicians in accordance with your spirit of overcoming difficulties and fighting tenaciously.

    Dear comrades of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Volunteers! I assure you that in the future, I will work harder to study science, technology, and culture, increase iron smelting output, and supply the motherland with more and better high-quality steel to support the motherland's national defense construction and economic construction.

    鞍钢特等劳动模范李凤恩
    写信给解放军和志愿军祝贺“八一”
    鞍钢特等劳动模范李凤恩在“八一”前夕写信给中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军，文如下：亲爱的中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军同志们：
    正当“八一”建军节来到和朝鲜停战协定签订的时候，我谨向你们——祖国的保卫者致以热烈祝贺。
    由于你们英勇地守卫着祖国边疆，特别是志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，坚决地打击了美帝国主义侵略者，取得了朝鲜停战的伟大胜利，因而保证了祖国人民的和平生活，保证了我们鞍钢的大规模建设。
    你们知道，鞍钢的钢铁生产技术指标早已超过敌伪统治时期的水平，几年来鞍钢已供应了祖国的国防建设和工业建设所需要的大量钢铁。例如修建成渝路、天兰路和根治淮河、荆江分洪工程所用的全部或部分重轨、轻轨、及其他钢材，都是鞍钢供给的。今年上半年我们炼铁厂又为国家超额炼出了大量供给炼优质钢的铁。在基本建设方面，巨大的，现代化的无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂等工程，只一年多的时间就建成了，现在大家正在忙着准备开工生产。
    我们钢铁战线上的职工，还依照着你们高度的爱国主义和顽强的战斗精神，学习了新的先进技术。例如，我原来是个不识字和不懂技术的工人，早先一个日本工程师说我得十八年才能学会炼铁技术。解放后，党培养我学习技术，在学习中确实也遇到许多困难，但一想到你们顽强克服困难的榜样，就给我增加了克服困难的勇气。我除了每天在厂里跟老师学习以外，下班以后，夜晚继续在家里钻研技术，困了就用冷水浇头或用针刺一下手指头提提精神，常常坚持到深夜两点，所以在六个月内我就学会了掌握炼铁的技术，并被评为优质技术员了。不仅我个人，而且鞍钢许多普通工人也依照你们克服困难顽强战斗的精神，成了技术工人或技术员。
    亲爱的人民解放军、人民志愿军同志们！我向你们保证，今后我一定更加努力学习科学技术文化，提高炼铁产量，供给祖国炼出更多更好的优质钢，支援祖国的国防建设和经济建设。
    鞍钢炼铁厂  李凤恩
    七月三十日
