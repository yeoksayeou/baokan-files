Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 5th. The Chinese youth delegation attending the 4th World Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship Festival held a get-together with the Soviet youth delegation on the morning of the 4th. More than 300 Soviet youth representatives attended.

	Hu Yaobang, head of the Chinese youth delegation, first warmly welcomed the Soviet youth, the older brothers of the Chinese youth. He said: The Chinese people have boundless trust and admiration for the Soviet people, because the Chinese revolution was victorious under the guidance of the great Marxist-Leninist doctrine, and because the rapid development of China's construction is inseparable from the great and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. Chinese youth love Soviet youth, because the Soviet youth educated by Stalin will always be a brilliant model for Chinese youth. Hu Yaobang concluded by shouting: For our common victory, for the victory of the cause of peace, let our friendship, like the waters of the Yangtze River and the Volga River, flow endlessly and last forever.

	Seleznev, head of the Soviet youth delegation, replied: Every meeting between our Soviet and Chinese youth has great significance, because every meeting will strengthen the friendship between our two countries and between our two youth. Every Soviet person loves the Chinese people, loves their long-standing culture, and loves their diligence, bravery, and enthusiasm. Seleznev once again, on behalf of the Soviet youth, congratulated the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers on their great victory. He said that the heroic Chinese youth played a great role in this victory. Seleznev finally congratulated the Chinese people and youth on their great achievements in the cause of building a new China.

	The get-together was held in an extremely warm atmosphere. Everyone repeatedly cheered for peace, for the great friendship between the people and youth of China and the Soviet Union, for the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, and for the leaders of the Soviet Party and government headed by Malenkov.

	The Chinese Youth Art Troupe and the Soviet Youth Cultural Work Troupe participating in the festival performed songs, dances, acrobatics and other programs to add to the fun at the get-together, and each program was warmly welcomed by the audience.

	Hu Yaobang then, on behalf of the Chinese youth delegation, presented the Soviet youth with an embroidered image of a peace dove, a tapestry woven with the emblem of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League, and a gold commemorative badge engraved with Chairman Mao's image. Seleznev accepted the gifts on behalf of the Soviet youth, and invited the Chinese youth delegation to hold another get-together with the Soviet youth delegation on the 5th. When the Chinese and Soviet youth held up a giant statue of a peace dove, thunderous applause and cheers rang out throughout the venue.

	Finally, everyone dispersed in joy in the magnificent singing of "March of the World Democratic Youth."

    联欢会在极为热烈的气氛中进行。大家一再为和平、为中苏两国人民和青年之间的伟大友谊、为中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东、为以马林科夫为首的苏联党和政府的领袖们而尽情欢呼。
    参加联欢节的中国青年艺术团和苏联青年文工团，在联欢会上演出了歌唱、舞蹈和杂技等节目助兴，每一节目都受到了全场的热烈欢迎。
    胡耀邦接着代表中国青年代表团将一幅和平鸽绣像、一幅织着苏联列宁共产主义青年团团徽的挂毯和刻着毛主席像的金质纪念章献给苏联青年。谢列平代表苏联青年接受礼品，他并邀请中国青年代表团于五日和苏联青年代表团再一次举行联欢。当中苏两国青年把和平鸽的巨像高高举起时，全场响起了雷动的掌声和欢呼声。
    最后大家在世界民主青年进行曲的雄壮歌声中尽欢而散。
