Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, August 10th: The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea recently issued a decree posthumously awarding the title of "Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" to Yang Chunzeng, a special-class meritorious person, first-class hero, and model Communist Party member of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and posthumously awarding him one First Class National Flag Medal and one Gold Star Medal.

Martyr Yang Chunzeng was the deputy platoon leader of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In the battle of Namsan, Zuoshoudong on August 5th last year, he led a platoon and a squad of comrades to bravely attack the hilltop, completely annihilating a platoon of the defending enemy Rhee Syngman's Capital Division in eight minutes. Subsequently, that same night and the following night, he led his comrades to repel eight frantic counterattacks by two enemy companies, wiping out many enemies. At dawn on the third day, Yang Chunzeng directed his comrades to repel multiple counterattacks ranging from a squad to two platoons of enemies, killing and wounding a large number of them.

As the fierce battle continued, most of his comrades were wounded or killed, leaving only Yang Chunzeng and Mou Yuanli on the position. Yang Chunzeng, with his last grenade beside him, firmly guarded the forward fortifications, while Mou Yuanli hurriedly seized the gaps to collect ammunition on the position.

Soon, more than a hundred enemies launched another counterattack under the cover of artillery fire. As Mou Yuanli hurried back, he saw that the enemies had climbed not far from Yang Chunzeng. At this moment, Mou Yuanli saw Yang Chunzeng holding up a grenade, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and bravely rushing towards the enemy ranks. With a loud explosion, more than twenty enemies were blown to pieces, and the immortal hero Yang Chunzeng also gloriously sacrificed.

In the days that followed, Yang Chunzeng's comrades, under the oath of "Avenge Comrade Yang Chunzeng!", attacked this position several times, annihilating more than 2,500 enemies.

    朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会发布政令
    追赠志愿军功臣杨春增烈士以英雄称号
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会最近发布政令，追赠中国人民志愿军特等功臣、一级英雄、模范共产党员杨春增烈士以“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄”称号，并追授一级国旗勋章及金星奖章各一枚。
    杨春增烈士生前是中国人民志愿军某部副排长。在去年八月五日座首洞南山战斗中，他率领一个排和一个班的战友勇猛地攻上山头，八分钟全部歼灭守敌李伪军首都师一个排。接着，他又在当天晚上和第二天晚上率领战友们打退了敌人两个连的八次疯狂反扑，歼灭了许多敌人。第三天拂晓，杨春增指挥战友们又打退了敌人从一个班到两个排的多次反扑，杀伤了大批敌人。
    随着激烈的争夺战的持续，大部战友都负伤或牺牲了，阵地上只剩下杨春增和牟元礼两个人。杨春增手边放着最后的一颗手雷，坚定地守卫在前沿工事里，牟元礼赶忙抓紧空隙在阵地上收集弹药。
    不久，一百多个敌人在炮火掩护下又发动了反扑。当牟元礼赶紧往回爬的时候，只见敌人已经爬到离杨春增不远了。这时牟元礼只见杨春增高举着手雷，喊着：“毛主席万岁！”奋勇冲向敌群，一声巨响，二十多个敌人被炸得粉碎，不朽的英雄杨春增也光荣牺牲了。
    在以后的几天里，杨春增的战友们在“为杨春增同志复仇！”的誓言下，又数次打上这个阵地，歼灭了两千五百多个敌人。
