To the respected Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

    On the occasion of the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I, on behalf of all the monks, lay officials, and people of Tashilhunpo Monastery in Xigazê, extend our highest respect and gratitude to you and the Chinese People's Liberation Army under your leadership. Under your leadership, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is becoming increasingly strong. It has become the protector of the happy life of all ethnic groups in the big family of the motherland and an important force in defending world peace. In the two years since the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, it has respected religious beliefs and customs and protected temples. Wherever they go, they help the people repair houses, clean up sanitation, and in addition to their own production, they also help farmers with the autumn harvest, build water conservancy projects, and issue interest-free agricultural loans. The medical personnel of the People's Liberation Army also help the people with free medical treatment and vaccinations. The army and the people are as close as family. This is completely different from the reactionary armies of the past. As the people of Xigazê say, "This is truly Chairman Mao's army, doing everything for the people." In the past year or so, thanks to the help of the People's Liberation Army, many construction projects have been developed in Xigazê. Primary schools have been established in Xigazê, an agricultural experiment station has been established, and a people's hospital is under construction. These facts are all included in Chairman Mao's important instructions for the construction of Tibet, which makes us realize that only the People's Liberation Army is the true army of all ethnic groups. We, the people of Tibet, are determined to thoroughly implement the agreement under your leadership, to fully support the People's Liberation Army and to be closely united with them forever, and to strive to build a new Tibet and consolidate the national defense of the motherland.

    班禅额尔德尼电毛主席朱总司令敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    兹值中国人民解放军建军二十六周年纪念日之际，我谨代表后藏札什伦布寺全体僧俗官员和人民向您们和您们所领导的中国人民解放军致以崇高的敬意和感谢。中国人民解放军在您们的领导下，日益强大，它已成为祖国大家庭里各族人民幸福生活的保卫者和保卫世界和平的重要力量。中国人民解放军进藏两年来，尊重宗教和风俗习惯，保护寺庙；所到之处，帮助人民修理房屋，打扫清洁卫生；除了他们自己生产外，还帮助农民秋收，兴修水利，发放无息农贷；解放军的医疗人员，还帮助人民免费治病、种痘，军民亲如家人，这和历代的反动军队完全不同，这正如后藏人民所说的：“这真是毛主席的军队，处处都为人民办事”。后藏在一年多来，由于人民解放军的帮助，许多建设事业得到发展；日喀则已经办了小学，创办了农业试验场，现在正建筑人民医院。这些事实，都包括在毛主席的建设西藏的重要指示里，使我们体会到只有人民解放军才是真正的各族人民自己的军队。我们西藏人民坚决在您们的领导下，彻底执行协议，以全力支援人民解放军并和他们永远亲密团结在一起，为建设好新西藏、巩固祖国的国防而奋斗。
    班禅额尔德尼
        七月二十九日
