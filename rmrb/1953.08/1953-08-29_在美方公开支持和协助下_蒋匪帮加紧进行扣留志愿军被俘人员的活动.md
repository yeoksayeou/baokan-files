Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 27th: As the date for transferring non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission draws nearer, the Kuomintang bandit gang, with the continued support and assistance of the US, is intensifying its heinous conspiracy to undermine the implementation of the armistice agreement and forcibly detain captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

It is reported that on August 25th, the Kuomintang bandit gang openly dispatched a so-called delegation, led by special agent chief Fang Zhi, to South Korea to go to the US-run POW camps holding non-directly repatriated captured Chinese People's Volunteers personnel to carry out conspiratorial activities to forcibly detain the prisoners of war. According to a report by the Associated Press, a spokesman for the US POW camp authorities said on August 21st that the United Nations Command had "not objected to" this increasingly rampant criminal act by the Kuomintang bandit gang to forcibly detain captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and would "cooperate within its power and ability" with these Chiang Kai-shek agents.

In addition, it is reported that Chiang Kai-shek agents lurking in the US POW camps are using terrorist tactics to force prisoners of war to tattoo characters and write blood letters to oppose transferring the prisoners of war to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, thereby coercing them to give up their right to be repatriated. All of this is being carried out with the support and assistance of the US. Despite this, the US is deliberately spreading rumors, saying that if non-directly repatriated prisoners of war are sent to the demilitarized zone, there will be some kind of "external force releasing" the prisoners of war "and taking them to North Korea." From this, one cannot help but suspect that the US is attempting to directly undermine the armistice agreement, creating excuses to refuse to send the prisoners of war to the demilitarized zone, in order to more smoothly forcibly detain them.

Sources here pointed out that the US is increasingly openly supporting and assisting the Kuomintang bandit gang in its criminal activities within its POW camps, while imposing various unreasonable restrictions and obstacles on the representatives of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross Society who are visiting the US POW camps in accordance with the armistice agreement. This obvious contrast shows that the US is stepping up its efforts to forcibly detain our captured personnel, and the US must bear full responsibility for this.

### 在美方公开支持和协助下  蒋匪帮加紧进行扣留志愿军被俘人员的活动

    在美方公开支持和协助下
    蒋匪帮加紧进行扣留志愿军被俘人员的活动
    【新华社开城二十七日电】双方不直接遣返的战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管的日期日益迫近，国民党匪帮在美方的继续支持和协助下，正在加紧进行破坏停战协定的实施和强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员的罪恶阴谋。
    有消息说，国民党匪帮在二十五日公然派遣了一个所谓代表团，由特务头子方治率领，到达南朝鲜，将到拘禁不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的美方战俘营去，进行强迫扣留战俘的阴谋活动。据合众社报道，美方战俘营当局发言人二十一日说，联合国军司令部对国民党匪帮这种愈益嚣张的强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员的罪恶行为
    “没有提出反对”，并将“在它的权力和能力范围以内”和这些蒋匪特务“进行合作”。
    此外，有消息说，潜伏在美方战俘营里的蒋匪特务正在大肆用恐怖手段强迫战俘刺字和写血书，反对把战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管，借以胁迫他们放弃被遣返的权利。所有这一切都是在美方支持和协助之下进行的。尽管如此，但美方却又故意制造谣言，说什么如果将不直接遣返的战俘送到非军事区去，就会有什么“外来力量释放”战俘，“并把他们带到北朝鲜”。从这里人们不能不怀疑美方是在企图直接破坏停战协定，制造藉口来拒绝把战俘送到非军事区，以便更顺利地强迫扣留他们。
    此间人士指出：美方越来越公开地支持和协助国民党匪帮在其战俘营内的罪恶活动，而对根据停战协定访问美方战俘营的朝中红十字会代表则加以种种无理的限制和阻挠。这种明显的对照，说明了美方正加紧强迫扣留我方被俘人员，美方对此必须负完全责任。
