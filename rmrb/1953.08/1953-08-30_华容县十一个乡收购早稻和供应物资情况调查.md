An Investigation of Early Rice Procurement and Material Supply in Eleven Townships of Huarong County
Zhou Chang, Zhang Yunting, Ling Meifu, Yang Zhenhua

The Finance and Economics Committee of the People's Government of Huarong County, Hunan Province, dispatched more than 30 cadres on July 5 to form eleven investigation teams. These teams went deep into eleven townships to investigate the market volume of early rice this year and the materials needed by farmers. This was done to prepare for this year's early rice procurement and material supply work based on these investigation materials.

From the investigation, it is estimated that the unit area yield of early rice in Huarong County this year will generally increase by more than 10% compared to last year (in very few areas, due to drought, the increase will be less than 10% or even a decrease compared to last year). Last year, the early rice field area was 100,000 mu, with a total output of approximately 40 million jin, and an average unit area yield of over 400 jin. This year, the early rice field area has expanded to 130,000 mu, accounting for 20.5% of the paddy field area. The estimated total output is over 63 million jin, with an average unit area yield of 480 jin, an increase of 21% compared to last year. Due to the expansion of the early rice field area and the good harvest of early rice, the income of farmers from early rice this year will increase by about one-half compared to last year, and the purchasing power of farmers will also increase accordingly. According to Liu Zuolin, the mutual aid team leader of Caixing Township, the team is an ordinary mutual aid team in Huarong County. Last year, the total area of early rice fields in the team was 8.8 mu, with a total output of 4,576 jin and an average unit area yield of 520 jin. This year, the total area of early rice fields has expanded to 11.8 mu, more than 34% larger than last year, with a total output of 6,805 jin, an average unit area yield of 576.7 jin, an increase of 10.9% in unit area yield compared to last year, and an increase of more than 47% in purchasing power. According to the general reflection of farmers, after the early rice harvest, 30% to 40% will be kept for their own consumption, and the remaining 60% to 70% will be put into the market to exchange for means of production and means of livelihood. This shows that the market volume of early rice this year will not be small. It also shows that doing a good job in the supply of materials, especially the supply of means of production such as agricultural tools and fertilizers, is an urgent and prominent issue. For example, in the fourth joint group of Baihe Township, the entire group has 250 people, planting 184.2 mu of early rice fields, with an estimated total output of 80,127 jin. The budgeted ration is 31.3%, and the grain sold accounts for 68.7%. Among them, the proportion used for repairing and adding bamboo and wooden utensils (baskets, drying mats, rice tubs, fences, brooms, etc.) accounts for 13.4%, adding ironware (sickles, etc.) accounts for 3.5%, purchasing fertilizers accounts for 2.2%, hiring labor or cattle accounts for 2.2%, purchasing sideline products (fishing gear, piglets, and bamboo strips, etc.) accounts for 4%, purchasing cloth and daily necessities accounts for 13.5%, purchasing oil, salt, etc. accounts for 6.9%, other miscellaneous living expenses account for 4.1%, repaying pre-autumn debts accounts for 6.9%, and the remaining 12% is used to pay for dyke repair costs and repay loans.

During the investigation, farmers put forward many valuable suggestions on the past procurement and supply work. Last year, in some places in the county, due to insufficient warehousing and tool preparation, as well as the poor attitude of some procurement personnel or their low technical level, not only was work efficiency low, wasting much of the farmers' labor and time, but also, during grain inspection, because the quality specifications were not accurately grasped, either the state or the farmers suffered losses. Wang Chunsheng, the militia captain of Baihe Township, told the investigation team such a thing: Last year, a father and son transported five dan of grain to the Ximen procurement station in the county town for sale. On the first day, they managed to get a number, but when it was their turn to weigh the grain, the procurement station cadre said that the quality was not good and that it had to be processed again. However, there were too many people selling grain, and there were not enough steel sieves and winnowing machines. By the time they got a winnowing machine and steel sieve on the second day, they did not get a number. It was not until the third day that they sold the grain. The father and son delayed for three days and were furious. In terms of material supply, the main problem was that the supply departments did not prepare the things that farmers needed, and the things that were prepared did not meet the needs of the farmers. In some remote procurement stations such as Songmuqiao and Wutiandu, farmers could not buy the goods they needed after selling their grain. They said: Here, you can only buy a little bit to eat. State-owned trade does not come here at all, and there are very few private merchants coming. We have to run more than ten li to buy things after selling our grain, which is really too inconvenient. In addition, farmers also raised many opinions on the fact that there were too few procurement points last year and the market management was not strict. They hoped that these shortcomings could be improved this year.

The results of this investigation show that the demands of farmers in Huarong County to sell grain are urgent. For example, Huarong County originally planned to procure 19 million jin of early rice and pre-collect 10 million jin of public grain, but by August 14, 10.7 million jin of pre-collected public grain had been put into storage, and the procurement of early rice had reached 25 million jin. Furthermore, due to the increase in grain production and the increase in farmers' enthusiasm for production, the market volume of grain after autumn will be even greater and more intense. Therefore, state-owned grain departments, cooperatives, and other state-owned commercial departments must learn from the experience and lessons of past procurement and supply work, simplify procedures, improve service attitudes, and fully guarantee the supply of means of production and means of livelihood.

    华容县十一个乡收购早稻和供应物资情况调查
    周昶  张云亭  凌美福  杨振华
    湖南省华容县人民政府财政经济委员会，在七月五日抽调了三十多个干部组成十一个调查组，深入到十一个乡调查了今年早稻的上市量以及农民需要物资的情况，以便根据这些调查材料做好今年的早稻收购和物资供应工作。
    从调查的情况来看，今年华容县早稻的单位面积产量，估计一般将比去年增加一成以上（极个别的地区因天旱影响，增产不足一成或比去年减产）。去年早稻田为十万亩，总产量约为四千余万斤，单位面积产量平均为四百余斤；今年早稻田扩大为十三万亩，占水田面积百分之二十点五，估计总产量为六千三百余万斤，单位面积产量平均为四百八十余斤，比去年增产百分之二十一。由于早稻田面积扩大和早稻丰收，今年农民早稻收入将比去年增加二分之一左右，农民购买力也随之增长。根据蔡兴乡互助组长刘作林说：该组是华容县一个普通的互助组，去年全组早稻田面积为八亩八分，总产量为四千五百七十六斤，单位面积产量平均五百二十斤；今年全组早稻田面积扩大为十一亩八分，比去年扩大百分之三十四强，总产量六千八百零五斤，单位面积产量平均五百七十六点七斤，单位面积产量比去年增加百分之十点九，购买力增长百分之四十七强。根据农民普遍反映，早稻收获以后，除留下百分之三十到四十供自己食用外，其余百分之六十到七十将投入到市场以换取生产资料和生活资料，这说明了今年早稻的上市量是不会少的，同时也说明做好物资供应工作特别是农具、肥料等生产资料的供应工作，是一个急迫而又突出的问题。如白鹤乡第四联组，全组共有二百五十人，种早稻田一百八十四亩二分，估计总产量为八万零一百二十七斤，预算留下的口粮是百分之三十一点三，卖出的粮食占百分之六十八点七。其中用于修添竹木器
    （箩筐、晒簟、扮桶、围摺、扫帚等）占百分之十三点四，添置铁器（镰刀等）占百分之三点五，购买肥料占百分之二点二，雇请人工或牛工占百分之二点二，购置副业生产品（渔具、小猪和木篾等）占百分之四，购买布匹及日用品等占百分之十三点五，购买油、盐等占百分之六点九，其他生活零星费用占百分之四点一，偿还秋前债务占百分之六点九，其余百分之十二用来缴纳修堤费用和偿还贷款。
    在调查中，农民对过去的收购和供应工作提出了许多宝贵的意见。去年收购时，该县有些地方因为仓储、工具准备不够，以及有些收购人员对群众态度不好或技术水平很低，不仅工作效率低，浪费了农民许多劳力和时间；同时，在验粮时因对品质规格掌握不准，往往不是国家吃亏就是农民吃亏。白鹤乡民兵队长王春生曾对调查组讲了这样一件事情：去年有父子两人运五担谷到县城西门收购站出卖，头一天好不容易领到了一个号子，但临到过秤时，收购站干部却说品质不好，要再车一道，可是卖粮的人多，钢筛和风车都不够用，等到第二天搞到风车、钢筛，又没有拿到号子，直到第三天，才算把粮食卖掉。父子两人耽误了三天工夫，气得心里冒火。在物资供应方面，主要是农民需要的东西供应部门没有准备；准备了的又不合农民的需要。在松木桥、五田渡等某些偏僻的收购站，农民卖了粮食后买不到需要的货物。他们说：这里只能买到一点吃的，国营贸易根本不上这里来，私商来的也很少，我们卖了谷子要跑上十来里才能买到东西，真是太不方便了。此外，农民对去年收购点设得太少，市场管理不严，也提出了许多意见，他们希望这些缺点今年能够改进。
    这次调查的结果说明：华容县农民出卖粮食的要求是迫切的。如华容县原计划收购早稻一千九百万斤，预征公粮一千万斤，但到八月十四日止，预征公粮已入库一千零七十万斤，收购早稻已达二千五百万斤。并且由于粮食产量的增加和农民生产积极性的提高，秋后粮食的上市量将更多、更猛。因此，国营粮食部门、合作社和其他国营商业部门，必须吸取过去收购供应工作中的经验教训，简化手续，改善服务态度，充分保证生产资料和生活资料的供应。
