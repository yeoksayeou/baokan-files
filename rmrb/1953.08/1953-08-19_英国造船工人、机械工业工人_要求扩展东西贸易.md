    Xinhua News Agency, London, August 15th: The annual meeting of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, representing three million workers, has closed here.

    Among the resolutions passed at the meeting was one calling for the expansion of trade with all countries as much as possible. The resolution stated: "The Confederation believes in particular that the United States' restrictions on trade with Eastern Europe and China are harmful to the British economy."

    When presenting this proposal, G. Doughty, Secretary of the Draughtsmen's and Allied Technicians' Association, pointed out that trade with Eastern countries (including China) "would help reduce Britain's economic dependence on the United States."

    Another resolution passed by the meeting unanimously called for an increase in wages for all members of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. Confederation President Mr. Brotherton spoke in support of this demand. He said: Even official figures show that since the summer of 1947, the cost of living has risen by more than 40 percent, and food prices have risen by almost 70 percent.

    英国造船工人、机械工业工人
    要求扩展东西贸易
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：代表三百万工人的造船工人及机械工业工人联合会年会已在此间闭幕。
    会议所通过的决议案中有一项要求尽可能扩大与所有国家之间的贸易。决议说：“联合会特别认为，美国限制与东欧和中国的贸易对英国的经济是有害的。”
    机器制造与造船业设计师工会书记格·道蒂在提出这个提案时指出：与东方国家（包括中国）贸易“将有助于减少英国在经济上对美国的依赖”。
    会议通过的另外一项决议一致要求增加造船工人及机械工业工人联合会全体会员的工资。联合会主席布拉瑟顿发言支持这个要求。他说：甚至官方数字也说明自从一九四七年夏天以来，生活费上涨了百分之四十以上，食物价格几乎上涨了百分之七十。
