Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: The Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry has issued a directive on establishing responsibility systems in production plants and mines. The directive first points out that the most fundamental and major shortcoming in current enterprise management is the serious phenomenon of no one being responsible in many management systems. Because many tasks cannot find directly responsible personnel, this has caused great losses to the country. To this end, the directive requires all production plants and mines to establish strict responsibility systems in key tasks through this movement, in order to effectively overcome the current chaotic and backward state of enterprise management, consolidate the results of the discussion of the national plan, ensure that the production plan can be implemented in a balanced manner, and promote further improvements in cost and financial management and technical safety work.

The directive requires all production plants and mines to establish and improve the following responsibility systems in a led and planned manner:

First, the system of exclusive responsibility in administration. Specific requirements are: (1) Implement a production area management system. A factory (mine) is administratively responsible for the overall production leadership of the factory by the factory director (mine manager); a workshop (pithead) is responsible for the production leadership of the entire workshop (pithead) by the workshop director (pit leader); a work section is responsible for the production leadership of the entire section by the foreman. (2) It is necessary to establish and improve the responsibility system for various functional organizations at the factory level, such as planning, production, technology, mechanical power, materials, financial accounting, labor wages, personnel, technical inspection, safety technology, sales, and administrative welfare departments. It is necessary to establish and improve the necessary organizations in the workshop, such as planning, production, technology, statistics, and safety. Clarify the scope of work, responsibilities, tasks, and nature of these institutions, and stipulate a responsibility system for achieving these tasks; clarify the responsible personnel for each matter and each task, so that all administrative work in the future has a specific organization and specific person responsible.

Second, the technical responsibility system. Specific requirements are: (1) Any factory should designate and appoint a chief engineer (or general engineer), and any workshop should designate and appoint a supervising technician. Under the leadership of the factory director and workshop director, they are responsible for leading production and technical work. (2) Any technical work should have a dedicated engineer or dedicated technician responsible for it, in order to oppose the phenomenon of no one being responsible for technical matters. (3) Establish and improve an independent technical inspection organization. Under the leadership of the factory director, inspect whether raw materials meet technical requirements; inspect whether the production process complies with technical operating procedures; and inspect whether products (including some semi-finished products) meet quality standards, in order to promote continuous improvement of product quality.

Third, the production scheduling responsibility system. Specific requirements are: (1) Improve the job planning system. For those with unsound or inaccurate job plans, the production section should be responsible for summarizing experience, improving the preparation of job plans, and gradually increasing the equilibrium rate of job plans. (2) Continue to improve the factory's production scheduling system to check the daily plan completion and supervise the mutual coordination of various workshops (pitheads), various processes, various auxiliary departments, and material transportation departments. (3) Establish and improve the production scheduling responsibility system for workshops and other related production responsibility systems (such as shift handover systems).

Fourth, the equipment maintenance and repair responsibility system. Specific requirements are: (1) Establish an equipment maintenance system. The maintenance of all important equipment should be the responsibility of someone, and the use and management of all important equipment should have a certain responsibility system and specific measures. (2) Strictly implement the scheduled periodic maintenance system and stipulate the organization (mechanical power section) to implement this system. Oppose the abnormal situation of rushing to repair at the beginning of the month and rushing to produce at the end of the month. (3) Establish a spare parts system. Currently, many enterprises are in a dangerous state of equipment operation due to old equipment and lack of spare parts. Therefore, necessary spare parts should be gradually developed in a planned manner.

Fifth, the safety technology responsibility system. Specific requirements are: (1) Improve safety technology organizations at all levels, so that relevant safety work is the responsibility of the factory director and workshop director, and specify the directly responsible personnel. (2) Formulate and revise safety technology regulations, and stipulate the responsibility system for implementing operating procedures. (3) Establish a safety education system. All employees who have not received safety education must undergo certain safety education and implement regular examinations. (4) Strictly implement the safety reward and punishment system.

Sixth, the technical supply responsibility system. Specific requirements are: (1) Establish a supply plan responsibility system. In the future, the formulation of enterprise material plans will be the responsibility of the material department, in order to overcome the state of no one being responsible for material plan management. (2) Establish and improve the material management system. Responsibility systems should be stipulated for procurement, acceptance, warehousing, storage, accounting, material requisition, and material return. (3) Establish a material quota management system. On the basis of discussing the plan, the material supply department should study and grasp the reserve quota and consumption quota of various materials, and carry out material management work according to the quota.

Seventh, all factories and mines must also establish a cost and financial responsibility system.

The directive requires all factories and mines in the production system of the Ministry of Heavy Industry to carry out this movement in a led and planned manner. In the production department, the focus should be on exposing the phenomenon of no one being responsible in the current work, analyzing the reasons for these phenomena, summarizing the experiences and lessons, and proposing methods for future improvement. In carrying out this movement, the leadership of all factories and mines must pay attention to mobilizing the vast number of employees, especially technical and management personnel. It is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological work of technical and management personnel, stimulate their enthusiasm, eliminate their ideological concerns, and improve their political awareness, so that they can inspect their work without any worries, expose the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and discuss specific solutions.

The directive points out: In order to grasp the specific situation in the movement in a timely manner and oppose generalization in leadership methods, each bureau and company should grasp two or three factories and mines, and from the beginning of the movement to the end of the movement, specifically lead them to analyze the situation, raise problems, and summarize experience, so that after several central tasks, some factories and mines with a better working foundation can be truly cultivated to promote the progress of general factories and mines. At the same time, the factory directors of each factory and mine should also be personally responsible when leading this movement, relying on the existing functional institutions and workshop management institutions to promote the progress of this central task.

The directive finally points out: In view of the fact that the central tasks previously arranged did not have sufficient time to carry out, and also because the tasks required by the responsibility system movement are very heavy, the time for this central task is generally five months. All factories and mines must seriously attach importance to this central task in order to truly improve the current enterprise management work.

    中央重工业部发出指示
    在生产厂矿建立责任制
    【新华社二十六日讯】中央人民政府重工业部发出了关于在生产厂矿建立责任制的指示。指示首先指出目前企业管理方面最根本最主要的缺点，是许多管理制度上存在着严重的无人负责现象。由于许多工作找不到直接负责的人员，给国家造成了很大的损失。为此，指示要求各生产厂矿通过这一运动，能够在主要的工作上建立起严格的责任制度，以便有效地克服目前企业管理方面的混乱和落后状况，巩固讨论国家计划的成果，保证生产计划能够均衡地执行，并促进成本财务管理和技术安全工作的进一步改善。
    指示要求各个生产厂矿有领导有计划地建立和健全以下几种责任制度：
    第一、行政上的专责制。具体要求是：（一）实行生产区域管理制度。一个工厂（矿山）在行政上由厂长（矿长）负责全厂的生产领导；一个车间（坑口）由车间主任（坑长）负责全车间（坑口）的生产领导；一个工段由工长负责全段的生产领导。（二）必须建立与健全工厂一级的各种职能组织责任制，如计划、生产、技术、机械动力、材料、财务会计、劳动工资、人事、技术检查、安全技术、推销以及行政福利等科。必须建立与健全车间里必要的组织，如计划、生产、技术、统计、安全等。明确这些机构的工作范围、工作职责、工作任务及其性质，并规定实现这些工作任务的责任制度；明确每一件事、每一件工作的负责人员，做到今后一切行政工作，都有一定的组织、一定的专人负责。
    第二、技术责任制。具体要求是：（一）任何一个工厂，都应该指定和委派一个主任工程师（或总工程师），任何一个车间，都应该指定和委派一个主管技术员。他们在厂长及车间主任领导下，负责领导生产技术工作。（二）任何一项技术工作，都应有专责工程师或专责技术员，以反对技术上的无人负责现象。（三）建立与健全独立的技术检查机构。在厂长领导下，检查原材料是否合乎技术要求；检查生产过程是否遵守技术操作规程；检查产品（包括部分半成品）是否合乎质量标准，以促进不断提高产品质量。
    第三、生产调度责任制。具体要求是：（一）健全作业计划制度。凡是作业计划不健全的、不确实的，应由生产科负责总结经验，改善作业计划的编制，以求作业计划的均衡率逐渐提高。（二）继续健全全厂的生产调度制度，以检查逐日计划完成情形，并监督各个车间（坑口）、各个工序、各个辅助部门以及材料运输部门的相互配合。（三）建立与健全车间的生产调度责任制及其他有关的生产责任制（如交接班制等）。
    第四、设备维护与检修责任制度。具体要求是：（一）建立设备的维护制度。所有重要设备的维护，都应有人负责，所有重要设备的使用、管理，都应有一定责任制度和具体办法。（二）严格实行按计划定期检修制度，及规定执行这一制度的机构（机械动力科）。反对月初突击检修、月末突击生产的不正常状况。（三）建立备品制度。目前不少企业由于设备老旧，又缺乏备品，常使设备运转处于危险状况中。因此应逐步有计划地制定必需的备品。
    第五、安全技术责任制。具体的要求是：（一）健全各级安全技术组织，使有关的安全工作除厂长、车间主任应负责任外，并规定直接的负责人员。（二）制定与修正安全技术规程，并规定执行操作规程的责任制度。（三）建立安全教育制度。凡是没有受过安全教育的职工，必须经过一定的安全教育，并实行定期考试。（四）严格实行安全奖惩制度。
    第六、技术供应责任制。具体要求是：（一）建立供应计划责任制。今后企业材料计划的制订，统一由材料部门负责，以克服材料计划管理中的无人负责状态。（二）建立与健全材料管理制度。从采购、验收、入库、保管、记帐、领料、退料等都应规定责任制度。（三）建立材料定额管理制度。在讨论计划的基础上，材料供应部门应研究与掌握各种材料的储备定额与消耗定额，并根据定额进行材料管理工作。
    第七、各个厂矿企业还必须建立起成本财务责任制度。
    指示要求重工业部生产系统的各厂矿，必须有领导地有计划地开展这一运动。在生产部门，应集中揭发目前工作中所存在的无人负责现象，分析产生这些无人负责现象的原因，总结其中的经验教训，并提出今后改善的方法。在开展这一运动中，各厂矿的领导方面必须注意发动广大职工特别是发动技术人员与管理人员。要加强技术人员与管理人员的政治思想工作，启发他们的积极性，解除他们的思想顾虑，提高他们的政治觉悟，使他们毫无顾虑地去检查自己的工作，揭露无人负责现象，并讨论出具体的克服办法。
    指示指出：为了及时掌握运动中的具体情况，反对领导方法上的一般化，各局、公司都应掌握两三个厂矿，从运动开始一直到运动结束，具体领导他们分析情况，提出问题，总结经验，以便经过若干中心工作后，真正培养出一些工作基础较好的厂矿，推动一般厂矿前进。同时各个厂矿长在领导这一运动时，也要亲自负责，依靠现有的职能机构及车间管理机构，推动这一中心工作进行。
    指示最后指出：鉴于过去所布置的中心工作没有充分的时间进行，同时更由于责任制运动所要求的工作任务又十分繁重，因此这一中心工作的时间一般为五个月。各厂矿都必须认真地重视这一中心工作，以达到真正改善目前企业管理工作的目的。
