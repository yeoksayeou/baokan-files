Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 17th: The Soviet government's note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States regarding the German question.

The Soviet government deems it necessary to once again call the attention of the governments of France, Britain, and the United States to the abnormal situation whereby, eight years after the end of the European war, a peace treaty with Germany has still not been concluded, Germany remains divided into East and West, and is in an unequal position with other countries. This situation contradicts the efforts of all peace-loving people to strengthen peace in Europe and infringes upon the legitimate national interests of the German people.

As early as March 10, 1952, the Soviet government submitted a draft of the principles of a peace treaty with Germany for consideration by the governments of France, the United States, and Britain. To this day, the governments of France, Britain, and the United States have not expressed their views on this draft (a copy of the draft principles of the peace treaty with Germany is attached). The governments of France, Britain, and the United States have also not put forward their own draft peace treaties. This shows that the above-mentioned three governments underestimate the importance of the peace treaty with Germany. The responsibility for the repeated delays in the peace treaty with Germany rests primarily with the governments of France, Britain, and the United States.

The governments of France, Britain, and the United States refused to consider the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and instead adopted a different path.

On May 26, 1952, the governments of France, Britain, and the United States, together with the Bonn Adenauer government, signed the "Convention on Relations Between the Three Powers and the Federal Republic of Germany," known as the "Bonn Treaty." On May 27 of the same year, the governments of France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, together with the Bonn government, signed the "European Defence Community" treaty, known as the "Paris Treaty." Both the "Bonn Treaty" and the "Paris Treaty" stipulate in advance an inseparable union with the aggressive Atlantic bloc for fifty years.

It is well known that the purpose of the "Paris Treaty" is to establish armed forces in West Germany, under the command of Hitler's generals and other revanchist elements, to join the so-called "European Army" aimed at carrying out the aggressive goals of the North Atlantic group. As for the "Bonn Treaty," under this treaty, West Germany will remain in a subordinate position to the three powers, a dependency of theirs. Despite the formal abolition of the occupation statutes, they will continue to station troops on West German territory and have unlimited rights to interfere in its internal affairs, which will subject the West German people to a disguised occupation regime for many years to come.

This means that the Bonn and Paris Treaties are leading to the revival of German militarism, turning West Germany into a tool for the aggressive plans of other countries seeking world hegemony.

As seen from the communique of the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, and the United States held in Washington in July 1953, the three governments have decided to continue to pursue their original policy, to implement the plan to establish a "European Army" and to incorporate the West German armed forces, headed by Hitler's generals, into this army. The communique states directly: "The three Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their determination to vigorously implement the policies agreed upon by their governments within the framework of the Atlantic Treaty, which include efforts toward European unification within the scope of six countries, which have already established the Coal and Steel Community, and whose governments have signed the European Defence Community Treaty."

The path taken by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the German question can only lead to the revival of German militarism, to the emergence of a dangerous new hotbed of aggression, and to an increasing risk of another war in Europe. To take this path is to abandon the solemn international obligations aimed at helping to rebuild Germany into a peace-loving and democratic nation, obligations that the United States and Britain assumed at the Potsdam Conference in 1945 and that France later acknowledged.

Another path is the one that conforms to the goals of peace-loving nations, conforms to the obligations assumed by the four powers on the German question at the very end of the war, and conforms to the interests of strengthening peace in Europe. Of course, we cannot fail to consider that eight years have passed since the Potsdam Conference, and considerable changes have taken place during this period, which must be taken into account in the final resolution of the German question. However, the main goal of the Potsdam Agreement—to assist in the establishment of a peace-loving and democratic Germany—still represents the interests of the peoples of Europe, including the German people, and this goal must be achieved through the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

Solving this problem will create conditions for unprecedented development in Germany, which has great potential for economic and cultural development. No one can deny that only through the peaceful and democratic development of Germany, only through cooperation with other countries striving to strengthen peace and international security, is it possible to rebuild Germany into a great power that can achieve an appropriate international position. Historical experience shows that the path of war has more than once led Germany to national disaster, and the German people have paid a high price for its consequences.

Undoubtedly, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is of great importance for the resolution of the German question. It will be a decisive help to the consolidation of peace in Europe and will make it possible to finally resolve all aspects of the problems arising from the Second World War, which the European countries that suffered from Hitler's aggression, especially Germany's neighbors, are very concerned about. The conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is also necessary because the threat of the revival of German militarism, which twice launched world wars, has not been eliminated, because the corresponding decisions of the Potsdam Conference have not been implemented. The peace treaty with Germany will establish lasting conditions for the German people, will promote the development of Germany into a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving country, and will ensure that the German people can cooperate peacefully with other countries on the basis of equal principles.

The governments of France, Britain, and the United States say that they refuse to consider a peace treaty with Germany because there is no all-German government that can participate in the drafting of a peace treaty with Germany. However, this reason for refusing to study the peace treaty is not in line with reality. In fact, the policies adopted by France, the United States, and Britain are not only increasingly delaying the study of the peace treaty, but are also delaying the issue of organizing an all-German government, because the purpose of this policy is to deepen the division of Germany and to prevent the re-establishment of German unity.

At present, despite the serious resistance of some countries' parliaments, the countries that have joined the Bonn and Paris treaties are under increasing pressure to ratify these two treaties. This pressure, especially the pressure exerted by the United States government, is aimed at accelerating the establishment of West German armed forces and allowing them to join the "European Army" stipulated in the Paris Treaty, to turn West Germany, relying on the North Atlantic Group countries, into a tool for implementing this group's plans. However, if West Germany joins the "European Army" and the North Atlantic Group, it means that West Germany cannot be regarded as a peace-loving country. West Germany's accession to the "European Army" and the North Atlantic Group will make it impossible for West Germany and East Germany to be unified into one country. All peace-loving people in Europe, like the German people, are extremely concerned about the establishment of a unified, peace-loving Germany. However, the more the Bonn government wants to drag West Germany into the North Atlantic Group, the more impossible it becomes for West Germany and East Germany to reunite. It is for this reason that the overwhelming majority of Germans—not only in the German Democratic Republic, but also in West Germany—oppose the Adenauer government's plan to drag West Germany into the "European Army" and the North Atlantic Group; and on this issue, the people of Europe stand with the German people.

Based on the above, the policies of the governments of France, the United States, and Britain, as well as the Adenauer government, are not aimed at unifying Germany or establishing an all-German government, but at keeping Germany divided for many years to come. The direct goal of such a policy is to resist the establishment of an all-German democratic government. Therefore, the excuse of not having an all-German government to refuse to consider a peace treaty does not reflect the true motives of this refusal.

From the above, it can also be seen that the current policies of the governments of France, Britain, and the United States are both against resolving the issue of a peace treaty and against unifying Germany in accordance with peaceful and democratic principles, against the establishment of an all-German democratic government.

Instead of solving the problem of establishing an all-German democratic government, the governments of France, Britain, and the United States have put forward another proposal. They propose discussing all-German elections, but reduce this matter to a four-power discussion of their proposal, namely, appointing a so-called neutral commission of foreign representatives to conduct an investigation to create the conditions for holding such elections. It cannot but be considered that this claim is an attempt to allow foreigners to control the elections held in Germany, and for this purpose to force the German people to accept all kinds of "investigators," as if the country concerned were not Germany with a long democratic tradition, but a powerless colony. This proposal prevents the German people from deciding their internal problems, it impudently expresses distrust of the German people, and naturally arouses the opposition of the broad German people.

The above-mentioned proposals of the governments of France, Britain, and the United States are fundamentally inconsistent with the democratic principles expressed in the Potsdam decisions. According to the statement of the three countries, this proposal has been agreed to by the Adenauer government, which serves the interests of the largest monopoly capital in West Germany, which gives yesterday's Hitlerites and blatant fascists more and more freedom of action in order to suppress the democratic forces in Germany, and which is the mouthpiece of extreme nationalists and revanchists who are trying to restore German militarism and to launch new wars of conquest. At the same time, we should remember that the Adenauer government has even stubbornly opposed the possibility of the four powers coordinating their policies on the German question, because it has completely tied its fate to the plan to revive German militarism, to the plan to prepare for a new war in Europe. It is for this anti-national goal that the Bonn government is trying to get the Paris and Bonn treaties ratified, even though these two treaties violate the national interests of the German people and mean turning West Germany into a dependent state, subjecting the German people to slavery for many years to come.

Therefore, the Paris and Bonn treaties are not at all aimed at restoring the unity of a democratic Germany; the real purpose of these two treaties is contrary to the basic principles of the Potsdam Conference; at this conference, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union decided to ensure the restoration of German unity and to rebuild Germany into a peace-loving and democratic nation, and France later signed and recognized these basic conditions.

From all the above, it seems that the issue of rebuilding a unified, democratic Germany has always been the most important issue for the German people, and the peaceful peoples of the entire Europe care about the solution of this issue. In this matter, any excuse for delay is untenable, because in the current situation, the main responsibility for solving this problem lies with the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. In any case, any measures, even if they only help to gradually solve the problem of German unification and the establishment of an all-German democratic government, should not be abandoned.

The Soviet government suggests to the French government, as well as the governments of Britain and the United States, that immediate practical measures be taken to resolve the German question.

Based on the above, the Soviet government believes that it is urgent to resolve the following basic policy issues on Germany:

(1) Convene a peace conference to discuss a peace treaty with Germany.
The Soviet government believes that such a conference, attended by all relevant countries, can be convened within six months. The Soviet government believes that there is no reason to delay convening a peace conference any longer. All preparatory work for preparing a peace treaty with Germany can be completed within the time specified above. It is important to ensure that Germany has representation at all stages of the preparation of the treaty and at the peace conference. Until an all-German provisional government is formed, representatives of the existing East and West German governments can participate in the preparation of the treaty.

(2) Organize an all-German provisional government and hold free all-German elections.
In order to restore German unity in accordance with peaceful and democratic principles, the Soviet government proposes that the parliaments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, with the broad participation of various democratic organizations, form an all-German provisional government. Such a government can be established as long as an agreement is reached directly between East and West Germany to replace the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany with this government. If this seems difficult at present, then the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany can be retained for a considerable period when organizing the all-German provisional government. Obviously, in this case, the all-German provisional government can only exercise limited powers in its initial stage. However, even in this situation, organizing an all-German provisional government is a real step towards German unity, and German unity can only be fully realized after organizing an all-German government on the basis of truly free all-German elections.

The tasks of the all-German provisional government:
A. The all-German provisional government can solve such urgent and important issues for all of Germany: Germany's representation at the time of concluding the peace treaty and representation in international organizations; preventing Germany from joining groups or military alliances aimed at opposing any country that participated in the war against Hitler's Germany with its own troops; the issue of German citizenship; ensuring the free activities of democratic parties and organizations, preventing the existence of fascist militarist organizations and other organizations that are hostile to democracy and hostile to the cause of maintaining peace; developing trade relations between East and West Germany; transportation, postal and telecommunications issues; the issue of free movement of people and goods not limited to the current occupation zone boundaries; developing economic and cultural relations between East and West Germany and other issues affecting the interests of all German people.

B. The main task of the all-German provisional government should be to prepare and hold free all-German elections, so that the German people can solve the problems of the social and national structure of a democratic Germany themselves without foreign interference.

The all-German provisional government should draft a draft all-German electoral law to ensure that the all-German elections are truly democratic in nature, ensure that all democratic groups participate in the elections, and prevent large monopoly capital from putting pressure on voters. Whether to investigate whether the necessary conditions for holding democratic elections exist throughout Germany and to adopt measures to guarantee such conditions should be freely decided by the all-German provisional government.

At the same time, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary for the governments of France, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to take measures to ensure that the all-German elections are held under truly free conditions and to prevent any country from exerting any pressure in the elections.

(3) Reduce the financial and economic obligations borne by Germany due to the consequences of the war.
Germany has fulfilled a considerable part of its financial and economic obligations to the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States, but in view of the need to improve Germany's economic situation, the Soviet government believes that there is an urgent need to make separate decisions in this regard.

A. The Soviet government believes that it is necessary to completely relieve Germany of the obligation to pay reparations and to repay post-war national debts to the four countries, except for trade debts, starting from January 1, 1954.

B. The Soviet government also believes that it is necessary to limit the expenses of the four countries for stationing troops on German territory. To this end, the Soviet government proposes that the annual maintenance costs of these troops should not exceed 5% of the national budget revenue of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and in any case should not exceed the occupation costs in 1949 when the formation of the North Atlantic Group had not yet affected the occupation costs.

The Soviet government also proposes to completely relieve Germany of the obligation to pay occupation costs to the four countries accumulated after 1945.

The Soviet government believes that the agreement between the Soviet Union, France, the United States, and Britain on the German question, and the decisions adopted on the above-mentioned proposals in the near future, will help to ease international tensions, thereby facilitating the strengthening of peace and international security.

The Soviet government has sent the same note to the governments of Britain and the United States.

    苏联照会法英美三国政府
    建议立即采取解决德国问题的实际措施
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日电：苏联政府就德国问题致法国、英国与美国政府的照会。
    苏联政府认为有必要再度促请法国政府、英国政府与美国政府注意这一不正常的情况，即：在欧洲战争结束八年以后，仍然没有缔结对德和约、德国仍然分裂为东西两部，并与其它国家处于不平等的地位。这种情况与各国爱好和平人民加强欧洲和平的努力相矛盾，并侵犯了德国人民的合法的民族利益。
    早在一九五二年三月十日，苏联政府曾以对德和约原则草案提交法国、美国与英国政府考虑，关于这个原则草案，法国、英国与美国政府至今未表示它们的态度（兹附上对德和约原则草案一份）。法国、英国与美国政府也没有提出它们的和约草案。由此可见，上述三国政府低估了对德和约问题的重要性。对德和约问题一再拖延，责任首先要由法国、英国与美国政府担负。
    法国、英国与美国政府拒绝考虑对德和约问题，而采取了另一条不同的道路。
    一九五二年五月二十六日，法国、英国、美国政府与波恩阿登纳政府签订了称作“波恩条约”的“关于三国与德意志联邦共和国的关系的公约”，在同年五月二十七日，法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰与卢森堡政府会同波恩政府签订了称作“巴黎条约”的“欧洲防务集团”条约。不论是“波恩条约”还是“巴黎条约”都预先规定了在五十年中与大西洋侵略集团不可分地结合在一起。
    大家知道，“巴黎条约”的目的是要在西德，在希特勒将领以及其它复仇主义分子的指挥下，建立武装部队，加入旨在执行北大西洋集团的侵略目标的所谓“欧洲军”。至于“波恩条约”，根据这个条约，西德仍将处于一个从属于三国的附属国地位，它们尽管已在形式上废除了占领法规，但仍将在西德领土上驻扎军队、并有无限权利干预它的内政，这将使西德人民在今后许多年内继续受一个改头换面的占领政权的奴役。
    这意味着波恩与巴黎条约引导向德国军国主义的复活，使西德变成其它要获取世界霸权的国家的侵略计划的工具。
    从一九五三年七月在华盛顿举行的法国、英国、美国三外长会议的公报中看出，三国政府决定继续奉行原来的政策，要执行建立“欧洲军”、并使以希特勒将领们为首的西德武装部队加入这支军队的计划。公报直接指出：“三外长重申他们决心，大力地执行他们的政府在大西洋公约范畴内所议定的政策，这些政策包括为欧洲六个国家范围内的欧洲统一而努力，这六个国家已经成立了煤钢联营集团，而他们的政府已经签订了欧洲防御集团条约。”
    美、英、法三国政府在德国问题上所走的道路只会导向德国军国主义的复活，导向危险的新侵略温床的产生，并使欧洲发生另一次战争的危险日益增加。走这条道路，就是抛弃旨在协助把德国重建成一个爱好和平的民主国家的庄严国际义务，而这些义务是美英两国在一九四五年的波茨坦会议上所承担的，是法国后来表示承认的。
    另一条道路是符合于爱好和平的目标、符合于四国在战争刚一结束时在德国问题上所承担的义务、并符合于加强欧洲和平的利益的道路。当然，我们不能不考虑到，从波茨坦会议到现在已经过了八年，在这段时期中，发生了相当多的变化，在德国问题的最后解决办法中必须考虑到这些因素。但是，波茨坦协定的主要目标——协助建立一个爱好和平的民主德国——迄今一直代表着欧洲各国人民——包括德国人民在内——的利益，这一目标必须通过缔结对德和约才能达到。
    解决这个问题将为德国的空前的发展创造条件，德国本来具有很大的经济与文化发展潜力。没有一个人能够否认，只有通过德国的和平民主发展，只有通过与其他为加强和平与国际安全而奋斗的国家合作，才有可能把德国重建成一个可以取得适当国际地位的大国。历史经验说明，战争的道路已经不止一次地使德国遭到民族灾难，而对其后果付出很高代价的是德国人民。
    毫无疑问，缔结对德和约对于德国问题的解决是十分重要的。它将对欧洲和平的巩固有决定性的帮助，并将使得有可能最后解决因第二次世界大战而产生的各方面的问题，对于这件事情，遭受过希特勒侵略的欧洲国家，首先是德国的邻国，是十分关心的。缔结对德和约之所以必要，也是由于曾两度发动世界大战的德国军国主义复活的威胁尚未消除，因为波茨坦会议的相应的决定还没有实行。对德和约将为德国人民建立起持久和平的条件，将促使德国发展成为一个统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的国家，并且将保证德国人民能够在平等的原则上与其他国家和平合作。
    法国、英国和美国政府说，它们之所以拒绝考虑对德和约，是因为现在还没有一个能够参加制订对德和约的全德政府。但是，这种拒绝研究对德和约的理由是不符合实际情况的。事实上，法国、美国和英国所采取的政策不仅在日益拖延对和约问题的研究，同时还在拖延关于组织一个全德政府的问题，因为这个政策的目的是要加深德国的分裂，是要阻止重新建立德国的统一。
    在目前，不顾某些国家的议会的严重抵抗，参加了波恩和巴黎条约的各国正受到日益强大的压力，要它们批准这两个条约。这种压力，特别是美国政府方面所施的压力，目的是想要加速建立西德的武装部队，让它加入巴黎条约所规定的“欧洲军”，要把依靠北大西洋集团国家的西德变成为一个实行这个集团的计划的工具。但是，西德如果加入“欧洲军”及北大西洋集团那就意味着，不可能把西德看作一个爱好和平的国家。西德加入“欧洲军”和北大西洋集团将使得西德和东德不可能统一成为一个国家。全欧洲爱好和平的人民都和德国人民一样，对于建立一个统一的、爱好和平的德国是极为关心的。但是，波恩政府越是要把西德拉进北大西洋集团，西德与东德的重归统一就越是不可能。正是因为这样，压倒多数的德国人——不仅是在德意志民主共和国，在西德也是一样——反对阿登纳政府把西德拉进“欧洲军”与北大西洋集团的计划；而在这个问题上，欧洲各国人民是与德国人民站在一起的。
    根据以上所述：法国、美国、英国政府以及阿登纳政府的政策，目的不是统一德国、不是建立一个全德政府，而是使德国在今后许多年内继续分裂下去。这样一个政策的直接目标是抗拒建立一个全德的民主政府。因此，藉口没有全德政府而拒绝考虑对德和约，并没有反映这种拒绝的真正动机。
    从以上所述还可看出：目前法国、英国与美国政府的政策既反对解决有关和约的问题，也反对遵循和平、民主的方针统一德国，反对成立全德的民主政府。
    法国、英国与美国政府非但不解决成立全德民主政府的问题，反而提出了另外一个建议。它们建议讨论全德选举，但是把这件事情缩减成为由四国讨论它们的建议，即任命一个所谓外国代表中立委员会来进行调查，以创造举行这种选举的条件。不能不认为这种主张乃是企图让外国把持在德国举行的选举，为此而强使德国人民接受各种各样的“调查者”，就好像当事国不是有悠久民主传统的德国，而是一个没有权利的殖民地。这个建议使德国人民不能决定他们的内部问题，它无礼地表示了对德国人民的不信任，自然也就引起了广大的德国人民的反对。
    法国、英国与美国政府的上述建议是与表现在波茨坦决定中的民主原则根本不合的。根据三国的声明，这个建议已经得到阿登纳政府的同意，这个政府是为西德最大的垄断资本的利益服务的，它为了压制德国民主力量而给昨天的希特勒分子和明目张胆的法西斯分子以越来越多的行动自由，它是正在力图恢复德国军国主义、力图发动新的征服战争的极端民族主义者和复仇主义者的喉舌。同时，我们应该记住，阿登纳政府甚至于一直顽固地反对四国协调它们在德国问题上的政策的可能性，因为它已把自己的命运完全系于复活德国军国主义的计划，系于准备欧洲新战争的计划。就是为了这个反民族的目标，波恩政府正力图使巴黎和波恩条约获得批准，尽管这两个条约违反德国人民的民族利益，并意味着把西德变成一个附属国家，使德国人民在以后的许多年中遭受奴役。
    所以，巴黎与波恩条约丝毫不是为了恢复一个民主德国的统一，这两个条约的真正目的是与波茨坦会议的基本原则背道而驰的；在这个会议上，美、英、苏三国决定保证恢复德国的统一，把德国重建成一个爱好和平的民主国家，法国后来也签署承认这些基本条件。
    由上述一切看来，重建一个统一的、民主的德国的问题，在过去和现在对德国人民来说，始终是最主要的问题，整个欧洲爱好和平的人民都关怀这个问题的解决。在这件事情上，任何拖延的藉口都是说不过去的，因为在目前情况下，解决这个问题的主要责任在于美、英、法、苏四国政府。无论如何，任何措施，即使只有助于逐步解决德国统一、成立全德民主政府的问题，也不应放弃。
    苏联政府向法国政府以及英国与美国政府建议，立即采取解决德国问题的实际措施。
    根据以上所说，苏联政府认为急需解决以下对德国的基本政策问题：
    （一）召开和平会议讨论对德和约。
    苏联政府认为，可以在六个月以内召开这样一个由所有有关国家参加的会议，苏联政府认为，没有理由再拖延召开和平会议。准备对德和约的所有预备工作是能够在上面所指定的时间内完成的。保证让德国在准备和约的所有各阶段中及在和平会议上都有代表参加，是一件很重要的事。在全德临时政府组成以前，现存的东德和西德政府代表可以参加准备和约的工作。
    （二）组织全德临时政府，举行全德自由选举。
    为了本着和平与民主的方针来恢复德国的统一，苏联政府建议德意志民主共和国与德意志联邦共和国议会，在各民主组织的广泛参加之下组成一个全德临时政府。这样的一个政府是能够建立起来的，只要直接在东德和西德之间达成协议，以这个政府来代替德意志民主共和国与德意志联邦共和国的政府。如果在目前这显得是困难的话，那么，在组织全德临时政府时，可以在相当时期内保留德意志民主共和国与德意志联邦共和国的政府。显然地，这样，全德临时政府在其初期只能行使有限的职权。可是，就是在这种情形之下，组织一个全德临时政府，也是向德国的统一真正迈进一步，而德国的统一是要在真正的全德自由选举的基础上组织一个全德政府以后才能全部实现的。
    全德临时政府的任务：
    甲、全德临时政府能为全德解决这样的迫切重要的问题：德国在缔结和约时的代表权以及在国际组织中的代表权；防止德国加入旨在反对任何一个曾以自己的军队参加对希特勒德国作战的国家的集团或军事联盟；德国公民权问题；保证民主党派与组织的自由活动，防止法西斯军国主义组织以及其它敌视民主与敌视维持和平事业的组织存在；发展东西德之间的贸易关系；运输、邮政及电讯问题；人民与货物不限于目前的占领区边界而自由流动的问题；发展东西德之间经济与文化关系以及其它影响全德人民利益的问题。
    乙、全德临时政府的主要任务应该是准备并举行全德自由选举，然后德国人民就能不受外国的干预，自己来解决一个民主德国的社会与国家的结构问题。
    全德临时政府应该草拟全德选举法草案，以确保全德选举具有真正的民主性质，确保所有民主团体都参加这次选举，并防止大垄断资本对选民施压力。是否要调查全德各地有没有存在举行民主选举所必要的条件和通过保证这种条件的措施，要由全德临时政府来自由决定。
    同时，苏联政府认为，法国、美国、英国以及苏联政府有必要采取措施，使全德选举在真正自由的条件下举行，防止在选举中有任何国家施行任何压力。
    （三）减轻德国由于战争的后果而担负的财政与经济义务。
    德国已经向苏联、法国、英国与美国履行了相当一部分的财政与经济义务，但鉴于有必要改善德国的经济情况，苏联政府认为有迫切的需要在这方面分别作出决定。
    甲、苏联政府认为有必要自一九五四年一月一日开始，完全解除德国偿付赔偿费及向四国偿付战后国债的义务，贸易方面的债务除外。
    乙、苏联政府同时认为，有必要限制关于四国在德国领土上驻扎军队的费用。为此苏联政府建议：这些军队的每年维持费不应超过德意志民主共和国与德意志联邦共和国的国家预算收入的百分之五，无论如何不应该超过一九四九年当北大西洋集团的形成还没有影响占领费用时候的占领费。
    苏联政府同时建议，完全解除德国偿付一九四五年以后累积的对四国的占领费的债务。
    苏联政府相信，苏联、法国、美国、英国在德国问题上的协议，以及在最近的将来就上述建议所通过的决定将有助于缓和国际紧张局势，从而便于加强和平与国际安全。
    苏联政府已把同样的照会送交英、美政府。
