Reader's Letter Summary:

    Model People's Policeman, Martyr Chen Changchun
    Reader Chun Lan writes: Among the People's Police in Wuhan City, there has also emerged a hero like Zhang Guofu (see this newspaper, December 12th of last year)—Chen Changchun, a People's Policeman from the Siguan Dian Sub-station of the Wuhan City Public Security Bureau's Water Police, who heroically sacrificed himself while rescuing an old woman and child from a broken boat in the swift currents of the Yangtze River during a storm.
    On the morning of September 23rd of last year, Comrade Chen Changchun was studying in the station when he suddenly heard a loud crashing sound coming from the riverbank. He ran out and saw a large wooden boat laden with cargo had collided with a pontoon. The swift current had already swept the front half of the wooden boat under the pontoon, and the mast was leaning against the pontoon, supporting the rear half of the boat. Fierce winds and waves continued to pound, and a grandmother in her fifties, Wang Guixiu, and her thirteen-year-old son, Peng Yuesheng, were still in the rear cabin, too frightened to move. At this critical moment, Comrade Chen Changchun, forgetting that he couldn't swim, bravely jumped into the rear cabin of the wooden boat to rescue the grandmother and child. He first rescued the child. By the time he had rescued the grandmother, the river water had reached his midsection. Before he could get up, the mast broke, and he sank with the wooden boat and was swept away by the waves. The outstanding son of the people, Chen Changchun, gave his most precious life for the people in this way.
    Comrade Chen Changchun was a native of Hanyang, Hubei Province, from a poor peasant family. He himself was a hired laborer. He was twenty-four years old. In 1950, he joined the local shipping company, working as a ticket inspector at the wharf. In 1951, he responded to the government's call and joined the public security work. Since joining the revolution, he had consistently worked actively and observed discipline. He had repeatedly risked his life to rescue people's lives and property from wooden boats damaged by rapid currents. Because of his style of close contact with the masses and his selfless work spirit, he was deeply praised by the local people. His heroic sacrifice fully demonstrated his love for the motherland and his infinite loyalty to the Party and the people, embodying the noble qualities of the People's Police under the leadership and education of the Communist Party, serving the people wholeheartedly.
    The former Public Security Department of the Central-South Military and Political Committee has specially decided to posthumously recognize Comrade Chen Changchun as a Model People's Policeman and to circulate his model deeds throughout the Central-South region's public security organs at all levels, using his exemplary deeds as a banner for all public security personnel and public security forces.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    模范人民警察陈长春烈士
    读者春岚来信：武汉市人民警察中也出现了一位张国富（见去年十二月十二日本报）式的英雄——武汉市公安局水上局四官殿分驻所人民警察陈长春，在一次有风浪的长江急流中，为抢救一只破船上的老人和小孩脱险而英勇牺牲了。
    去年九月二十三日上午，陈长春同志正在所内学习，忽然听到江边传来巨大的碰撞声，他就跑出去。看到一艘载重的大木船碰在趸船上；急流已把木船的前半身卷进趸船底下，桅杆靠着趸船支持着木船的后半身。惊风骇浪正继续冲击，木船后舱一位五十多岁的老大娘王桂秀和她十三岁的儿子彭岳生还没有出来，正吓得不能动了。在这千钧一发的紧急关头，陈长春为了抢救老大娘和小孩，就忘记了自己不会游泳，勇敢地跳到木船后舱，首先把小孩救出。等他救出老大娘时，江水已淹到他半身，他还没有来得及爬起，桅杆就断了，他便随着木船沉没，被浪涛卷去了。人民的优秀儿子陈长春就这样为人民献出了他最宝贵的生命。
    陈长春同志，湖北省汉阳人，贫农家庭出身，本人是雇工成份，二十四岁。一九五○年参加当地轮船公司工作，任码头查票员。一九五一年他响应政府号召参加公安工作。他自参加革命以来，一贯积极工作，遵守纪律。曾经多次在被急水打坏的木船中，奋不顾身地抢救人民的生命和财产。由于他有密切联系群众的作风和忘我的工作精神，深得当地群众的称赞。他的英勇牺牲，更充分表现了他热爱祖国、对党对人民的无限忠诚，体现了人民警察在共产党的领导与教育下所具备的全心全意为人民服务的高贵品质。
    前中南军政委员会公安部特决定：追认陈长春烈士为模范人民警察，并通报中南全区各级公安机关，用他的模范事迹，作为全体公安人员和公安部队的旗帜。
