Licheng County, Shandong Province, in carrying out the first batch of township elections, has achieved good results by correctly implementing the various policies on grassroots election work, mastering the working principle of combining production and advancing steadily, and conducting extensive and in-depth democratic education. The democratic awareness of the masses has been raised, the work style of cadres has been transformed, thus ensuring the victory of the election, and the election has improved various rural tasks. The most concentrated and prominent manifestation of the masses' enhanced democratic awareness is the participation of the vast majority of voters in the election. According to statistics from Shahe and Zhang'er townships, the average number of voters participating in the election reached more than 91 percent of the total number of voters. Many people who had never participated in political activities before also participated in the election this time. In the election, the masses carefully selected the people they considered most satisfactory. When nominating candidates for representatives, the masses compared, commented on, and carefully selected each cadre. The voters compared the selection of cadres to "sifting with a dustpan, then sifting with a sieve, and then sifting again with a fine sieve." After the masses in Shahe Township elected their township head, they also passed a resolution at the township people's congress: "Learn from township head Lu Shouquan." The masses' comments on cadres are fair, mainly based on whether they can lead production. Wang Xueli, the director of the Production Committee of Peijiaying Township, led production well in the past. During the election, the voters said: "Electing this good cadre can really do things for the people." Village clerk Li Dengxian only said nice things but did not do practical things. The masses criticized him as "the cat that meows doesn't catch mice."

The masses' strict selection and fair comments on cadres are an excellent education for all cadres. Except for a few serious lawbreakers, serious bureaucrats, the work style of most cadres has undergone significant changes, thus regaining the trust of the people. Chen Jialuo, the head of Yushanxi Township, was somewhat negative in his work in the past and was prepared to step down in this election. After being criticized by the masses, he made a profound self-criticism, his work style changed greatly, and he actively led the masses to eliminate all the wasteland in the township. When treating cotton aphids, because the masses were not used to using tobacco leaves to kill insects, he bought four ounces of tobacco leaves himself, prepared a medicine, and personally went to the field to experiment and show the masses. The masses said: "This township head has really changed." Judging from the townships that have already held election meetings and people's congresses, original cadres account for about 80 percent of the newly elected representatives, members of the township people's government, and staff of various other committees.

The masses' increased awareness is also manifested in the strengthening of their sense of ownership and their constant supervision of cadres and concern for various tasks with a high sense of ownership. According to statistics from the Ninth District in one month, the masses submitted 1,329 criticisms, reports, suggestions, and requests regarding cadres and matters that should be promoted or reformed, in the form of people's letters. Among them, 171 were constructive suggestions, 575 were criticisms of cadres, 129 were reports of landlord and counter-revolutionary activities, 69 were domestic disputes, and 385 were other issues. This ensures that the Party and the government maintain closer ties with the masses, understand the masses' demands and voices in a timely manner, and correct shortcomings, improve work, and improve leadership levels based on this, giving full play to the role of the people's democratic dictatorship.

Due to the transformation of cadres' work style and the increased enthusiasm of the masses for production, production work has been greatly improved, especially in the current control of cotton aphids, topdressing of autumn seedlings, and summer weeding. The Ninth District has never had the habit of controlling cotton aphids, but this year it has been treated three to four times. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn seedlings, Peijiaying Township in the First District, in the absence of bean cake, cadres took the lead in purchasing chemical fertilizers, conducting demonstration experiments, and summarizing experience to introduce to the masses. In a few days, they sold more than 13,000 jin of chemical fertilizers. In Zhangjia Township in the Ninth District, due to the lack of bean cake, under the slogan of "soil fertilizer instead of bean cake," the masses dismantled 350 kangs (heated brick beds), plus other methods, and increased the amount of soil fertilizer by more than 36,000 dan (a unit of weight), making up for the lack of fertilizer. Many mutual aid teams have improved democratic management. The masses said: "A large election in the township, a small election in the mutual aid team."

After the new grassroots regime was established, organizational rectification was carried out universally, and the phenomenon of too many organizations, too many cadres, and too many concurrent positions of cadres was initially overcome. In the past, grassroots organizations generally had more than a dozen committees. Including mass organizations, each township had about 200 to 300 cadres, and some cadres held 11 positions concurrently. After the election, all townships have undergone organizational rectification. Now, the townships that have held people's congresses have established seven committees under the leadership of the township government. The total number of cadres and representatives is about 70, and even with the mass organizations, it does not exceed 100, which is about two-thirds less cadres than in the past. Due to the increased awareness of cadres and the streamlining of organizational structures, work efficiency has been greatly improved, and the relationship between cadres and the masses has been further improved. For example, in Lengshuigou Township, after the election, various committees were able to play their due role and actively implement the resolutions of the people's congress. Except for the failure to complete the task of digging wells for drought prevention due to the early arrival of the rainy season, the rest were overfulfilled. When administering vaccinations, the original plan was to vaccinate 200 people. Due to the patient mobilization of cadres, 274 people were vaccinated. Cadres can consult with the masses on everything, and therefore have won the heartfelt support and support of the masses. (Zhang Rongan)

    山东历城第一批普选乡正确贯彻普选政策
    干部群众觉悟提高各项工作得到改进
    山东省历城县在进行第一批乡的普选工作中，由于正确地贯彻了关于基层选举工作的各项政策，掌握了结合生产、稳步前进的工作方针，广泛深入地进行了民主教育，因而取得了良好效果。群众民主觉悟提高，干部作风转变，从而保证了选举的胜利进行，并通过普选改进了农村各项工作。群众民主觉悟的提高，最集中突出的表现是最大多数选民参加了选举。据沙河、张二两个乡的统计，参加选举的选民，平均达选民总数的百分之九十一强。不少从来没有参加过政治活动的人，这次也参加了选举。在选举中，群众认真地挑选了自己认为最满意的人。在提代表候选人时，群众把每个干部都作了对比、评论和慎重的挑选。选民们把挑选干部比作“簸箕簸了筛子筛，再用细箩箩一遍”。沙河乡群众选出他们的乡长后，还在乡人民代表大会上通过一项决议：“向乡长路守全学习”。群众对干部的评论是公允的，主要是以能否领导生产为标准。裴家营乡生产委员会主任王学礼，过去领导生产好，选举时选民们说：“选上这个好干部真能给人民办事。”村文书李登贤光说漂亮话，不做实际事，群众批评他为“叫唤的猫不捉老鼠”。
    群众对干部的严格挑选和公正的评论，对于所有干部是一次极好的教育；除了个别的严重违法乱纪分子、严重的官僚主义分子外，大部分干部作风有了显著的转变，因而也就重新取得人民的信任。鱼山西乡乡长陈嘉洛，过去工作有些消极，准备在这次选举中下台；经群众批评后，作了深刻检讨，作风大为转变，积极领导群众消灭了全乡的荒草地；治棉蚜虫时，因群众没有习惯用烟叶杀虫，他自己先买了四两烟叶，配成药剂，亲自到地里试验给群众看。群众说：“这个乡长真转变了。”从已经开过选举大会和人民代表大会的乡来看，新选出的代表、乡人民政府委员及其他各种委员会工作人员中，原干部占百分之八十左右。
    群众觉悟的提高，还表现在主人翁思想的加强，以高度主人翁的态度来经常地监督干部和关心各项工作。据第九区一个月的统计，群众对干部及应兴应革事项，用人民来信的方式提出了一千三百二十九件批评、检举、建议和要求等，其中一百七十一件是属于建设性的建议，五百七十五件是对干部的批评意见，一百二十九件是检举地主和反革命分子活动的，六十九件是家务纠纷，其他方面问题三百八十五件。这就保证了党和政府更加密切地联系群众，及时了解群众的要求和呼声，并据此纠正缺点、改进工作、提高领导水平，充分发挥了人民民主专政的作用。
    由于干部作风的转变，群众生产积极性的提高，生产工作有了很大的改进，尤其在当前除治棉蚜、秋苗追肥、夏锄等方面，成绩更为显著。第九区向来没有治棉蚜习惯，今年普遍治了三到四遍。第一区裴家营乡为了争取秋苗丰收，在缺乏豆饼的情况下，干部带头购买化学肥料，进行示范试验，并总结经验向群众介绍，几天时间就推销化学肥料一万三千多斤；第九区张家乡因缺乏豆饼，在“土肥代豆饼”的口号下，群众拆炕三百五十个，再加其他办法，共增加土肥三万六千余担，补救了肥料的不足。许多互助组都改善了民主管理。群众说：“乡里大普选，互助组里小普选。”
    新的基层政权产生后，普遍进行了组织整顿，初步克服了组织多、干部多和干部兼职多的现象。过去，基层组织一般都有十几种委员会，连群众团体在内，每乡约有干部二百到三百人左右，有的干部身兼十一职。经过普选的各乡，都作了组织整顿。现在已经开过人民代表大会的乡，在乡政府领导下设七种委员会，干部和代表的总数约七十人，连同各群众团体也不超过百人，比过去减少了干部三分之二左右。由于干部觉悟的提高，组织机构的精简，工作效率大为提高，干部和群众关系更加改善了。如冷水沟乡，自选举后各种委员会都能起到应起的作用，积极执行人民代表大会的决议，除打井防旱因雨季到来早未完成外，余均超额完成。在注射防疫针时，原计划注射二百名，由于干部耐心动员，注射了二百七十四名。干部遇事都能和群众商量，因而得到群众的衷心拥护和支持。 （张荣安）
