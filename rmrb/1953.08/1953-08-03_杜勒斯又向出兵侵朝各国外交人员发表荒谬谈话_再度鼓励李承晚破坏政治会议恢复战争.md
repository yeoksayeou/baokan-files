Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 2nd: Our special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Dulles departed from Washington on the 2nd to meet with his lackey Syngman Rhee in South Korea. The four U.S. senators who were originally scheduled to accompany Dulles abandoned their plans because the U.S. Congress could not adjourn as scheduled. Accompanying Dulles to South Korea are: U.S. Representative to the United Nations Lodge, Secretary of the Army Stevens, Assistant Secretary of State Walter Robertson and McCardle, and Director of the State Department's Northeast Asian Affairs Office, Young, among others.

Dulles's trip to South Korea with such a large entourage is certainly not a good omen for the future of peace in Korea. This is made even clearer by Dulles's words in Washington on the 1st to the diplomats of the fifteen countries that sent troops to invade Korea.

Dulles told the diplomats of these fifteen countries that the main issues he would discuss with Syngman Rhee were:

	One, what actions would they take if the political conference failed to achieve their common goal of "unifying Korea" after ninety days?

	Two, the conclusion of a mutual security treaty, which would allow the United States the "right" to station troops in South Korea.

	Three, the "revival" of South Korea with nine hundred million U.S. dollars over four to five years.

Dulles reassured the apprehensive "allied" representatives that while the U.S.-Rhee security treaty would give the U.S. the "right" to station troops in South Korea, it would not affect the political solution stipulating the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea.

However, Dulles revealed that the United States was attempting to keep its troops in South Korea in another way, and was also attempting to keep the troops of those "allied" countries in South Korea. Dulles said that Eisenhower had approved a plan to use the U.S. troops in Korea to carry out a plan to "revive" South Korea. Dulles also wanted these "allies" to help the United States with "money and troops" in this so-called "plan to revive Korea."

Dulles's words show that he not only wants to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, but also to make it impossible to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea. As everyone knows, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, including the Chinese People's Volunteers and the U.S. troops, is one of the main agenda items of the political conference and a prerequisite for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. Dulles's decision to keep U.S. troops and the troops of America's allies in South Korea is, in effect, to make the political conference fruitless and a failure.

What actions will the United States and Syngman Rhee take after the political conference ends without result? Syngman Rhee has said that he will resume the war at that time, and Dulles has also agreed to discuss what actions to take with Syngman Rhee.

Because Dulles has given such blatant encouragement to Syngman Rhee's attempts to sabotage the armistice, Syngman Rhee has become even more carried away. He issued a statement to American reporters today saying that "the United Nations and South Korea should fully cooperate to achieve their common goal: to reunify Korea," and "if the United Nations abandons this position, then we will have to deal with the situation alone." He told the American warmongers to "rest assured" that he had only agreed to "temporarily postpone our own efforts for a certain period of time." He said that the armistice was only to allow U.S. soldiers and Rhee's puppet soldiers to "take a breather temporarily." He hopes that the day of "victory" "will come soon."

Dulles's recent series of absurd statements has undoubtedly cast a shadow over the future of peace in Korea. It is no accident that world opinion is fiercely criticizing Dulles. People are closely watching Dulles's trip to South Korea. People must pay serious attention to all the actions of this ambitious man in South Korea, who went to South Korea three years ago to instigate the war.

### 杜勒斯又向出兵侵朝各国外交人员发表荒谬谈话  再度鼓励李承晚破坏政治会议恢复战争

    杜勒斯又向出兵侵朝各国外交人员发表荒谬谈话
    再度鼓励李承晚破坏政治会议恢复战争
    【新华社开城二日电】本社特派记者江南报道：杜勒斯二日从华盛顿动身到南朝鲜去会见他的走狗李承晚去了。本来预定和杜勒斯一起去的四个美国参议员，因为美国国会不能如期休会，所以放弃了原定的计划。和杜勒斯一起到南朝鲜去的有：美国驻联合国代表洛奇，陆军部部长斯蒂文斯，助理国务卿华尔特·罗伯逊和麦卡德尔，国务院东北亚洲司司长杨格等人。
    杜勒斯带着这么一大帮人到南朝鲜去，对于朝鲜和平的前途决不是什么好兆头。这一点，从杜勒斯一日在华盛顿对出兵侵朝的十五个国家的外交人员所说的话看来，就更加清楚了。
    杜勒斯向这十五个国家的外交人员说，他要和李承晚讨论的主要问题是：
    一，如果政治会议在九十天之后不能达到他们的
    “统一朝鲜”的共同目标的话，他们将采取什么行动？
    二，订立共同安全条约，其中将允许美国有驻兵南朝鲜的“权利”。
    三，用九亿美元在四年到五年期间“复兴”南朝鲜。
    杜勒斯安慰那些满心疑惧的“盟国”代表们说，美李安全条约虽然将使美国有“权利”驻兵南朝鲜，但是不会影响规定外国军队撤出朝鲜的政治解决。
    可是杜勒斯透露了，美国企图用另一种方式把它的军队继续留在南朝鲜，而且企图把那些“盟国”的军队也继续拖住在南朝鲜。杜勒斯说，艾森豪威尔已经批准了一个计划，要把在朝鲜的美国军队用来进行“复兴”南朝鲜的计划。杜勒斯还要这些“盟国”用“金钱和军队”帮助美国进行这个所谓“复兴朝鲜的计划”。
    杜勒斯的话表明：他不但要阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，而且要使从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队成为不可能。大家知道，从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军和美国军队在内，是政治会议的主要议程之一，也是和平解决朝鲜问题的先决条件。杜勒斯决定要把美国军队和美国的盟国的军队都留在南朝鲜，实际上就是要使政治会议一无所成而终告失败。
    政治会议无结果而散之后，美国和李承晚将采取什么行动？李承晚已说过，到那时候就要重新恢复战争，杜勒斯也答应与李承晚一起讨论采取什么行动。
    由于杜勒斯对于李承晚破坏停战的企图作了这样露骨的鼓励，李承晚就更加得意忘形了。他今天就对美国记者们发表声明说，“联合国和韩国应该完全合作，来达到它们的共同目标：重新统一朝鲜”，“如果联合国放弃这种立场，那么我们就不得不独自应付局势”。他要美国的好战分子们“尽可以放心”，他说，他只不过同意“在一定时限内暂时延期进行我们自己的努力”而已。他说，停战只不过是使美国士兵和李伪军士兵“暂时可以舒一口气”罢了。他希望“胜利”的一天“会很快到来”。
    杜勒斯最近发表的一连串荒谬的谈话，无疑地已经在朝鲜和平的前途上投下了暗影。世界舆论对杜勒斯发出猛烈的抨击，完全不是偶然的。人们正密切注视着杜勒斯的南朝鲜之行。对于这个在三年前到南朝鲜去策动战争的野心家，这一次在南朝鲜的一切行动，人们必须加以严重注意。
