    An introduction to the contents of the Chinese edition of the Cominform newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" No. 29, 1953.

    This issue publishes the decision of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the anti-Party activities of Beria and the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on Beria's anti-state crimes. It also devotes considerable space to the news of enthusiastic support for the above-mentioned decision and resolution from Party organizations and working people across the Soviet Union, as well as from Communist and Workers' Parties and working people of various countries. This issue also published an editorial entitled "The Indestructible Unity of the Communist Party, Government, and People of the Soviet Union." The editorial pointed out that the decision of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have been unanimously supported by the entire Party and all the people of the Soviet Union. At the plenary sessions of local Party committees, meetings of grassroots Party organizations, and many large gatherings, Party members and working people have unanimously denounced the crimes of Beria, a despicable mercenary of international imperialism. The entire Soviet people wholeheartedly support the Party's policies, and they are uniting more closely around the Communist Party, raising their vigilance, and redoubling their efforts to strengthen the country and realize the grand plan of building communism. On the other hand, the decision of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union have also been met with extremely broad responses in various countries. Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries, and progressive people and forces throughout the world, correctly believe that the exposure of Beria's anti-Party and anti-state crimes is a testament to the further consolidation of the rock-solid unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the further consolidation of the Soviet state and the entire camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, and a heavy blow to the sinister conspiracies of the imperialists. Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries have drawn important political conclusions from the Beria incident, and they know that their noble mission and combat tasks lie in constantly and everywhere learning from the example of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The editorial concluded by saying: The great and invincible strength of the Soviet Union, the guarantee of its winning new world-historic achievements in communist construction and in the great struggle for peace, lies in the close unity of the Communist Party, government, and people of the Soviet Union.

    This issue publishes an article by Imre Nagy, member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Working People's Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, entitled "On the Measures of the Hungarian Working People's Party and Government to Improve the People's Living Standards." The article first analyzes the various achievements of the Hungarian people under the leadership of the Working People's Party in developing the national economy. The article then, based on the decision of the Central Committee meeting of the Hungarian Working People's Party at the end of June, describes the shortcomings in Hungary's past economic policies, which were mainly: in industry, failing to consider actual possibilities and developing heavy industry too rapidly, which affected the improvement of the living standards of the working people; in agriculture, insufficient investment in basic construction, insufficient assistance to individual farmers, and the existence of violations of the voluntary principle in the development of agricultural production cooperatives. The article then talks about the main tasks facing the Party and the government in overcoming these shortcomings in various aspects, and the various measures taken to improve the people's living standards. The article says: The Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party has decided to continue to implement the policy of socialist industrialization unswervingly, and to take this as the Party's main direction. While developing heavy industry, it is necessary to ensure the increase in the production of consumer goods, rapidly develop agriculture, and gradually improve the living standards of all working people.

    This issue also publishes an article by Jean Pronteau, member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, entitled "Developing Trade Between France and Democratic Countries." The article points out that as a result of France's economic and political subordination to the demands of the United States, France's total foreign trade volume is shrinking and its foreign trade deficit is rapidly increasing. The only way for France to eliminate this serious situation is to restore national independence, end the Vietnam War, reduce military spending, and restore free trade with all countries. The article emphasizes the benefits of expanding trade with democratic countries for French industry, agriculture, and the working masses, and points out that France's recovery of comprehensive foreign trade in the near future depends on the French people's struggle for independence and peace.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第二十九期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第二十九期中文版已经出版。
    本期刊载了苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议关于贝利亚反党的决定和苏联最高苏维埃主席团关于贝利亚反国家罪行的决议，并以大量篇幅刊载了苏联各地党组织、劳动人民以及各国共产党、工人党和劳动人民热烈拥护和支持上述决定和决议的消息。本期并以“苏联共产党、政府和人民的不可摧毁的团结”为题发表了社论。社论指出，苏联共产党中央全体会议的决定和苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议，得到了苏联共产党全党和全体苏联人民的一致拥护。在各地党委员会全体会议、基层党组织的会议以及许多大会上，党员和劳动人民一致痛斥了国际帝国主义的卑鄙的雇佣分子贝利亚的罪行。全体苏联人民衷心拥护党的政策，他们正更加紧密地团结在共产党的周围，提高警惕，并加倍努力为加强祖国的力量、为实现建设共产主义的宏伟计划而斗争。另一方面，苏联共产党中央全体会议的决定和苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议，也在各国得到了极其广泛的响应。各国共产党和工人党、全世界的进步人民和进步力量正确地认为，贝利亚的反党、反国家罪行的被揭露，是苏联共产党的磐石般的团结得到进一步巩固的证明，是苏维埃国家和整个和平、民主和社会主义阵营得到进一步巩固的证明，是对于帝国主义者的罪恶阴谋的一个沉重的打击。各国共产党和工人党从贝利亚事件中得出了重要的政治结论，它们知道它们的崇高使命和战斗任务，在于经常和处处学习苏联共产党的榜样。社论最后说：苏联伟大的和不可战胜的力量，它在共产主义建设、在争取和平的伟大斗争方面赢得新的世界历史性成就的保证，就在于苏联共产党、政府和人民的密切团结。
    本期刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党政治局委员、匈牙利人民共和国部长会议主席伊姆雷·纳吉撰写的“关于匈牙利劳动人民党和政府提高人民生活水平的措施”一文。文章首先分析了匈牙利人民在劳动人民党的领导下，在发展国民经济方面的种种成就。文章接着根据六月底匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会会议的决定，叙述了匈牙利过去经济政策中存在的缺点，这些缺点主要是：在工业方面，没有注意到实际的可能性，而过分急速地发展重工业，以致影响了劳动人民生活水平的提高；在农业方面，基本建设投资过少，对个体农民帮助不够，农业生产合作社的发展中存在着违反自愿原则的现象。文章接着谈到了党和政府为克服这些缺点在各方面所面临的主要任务，以及为提高人民生活水平而采取的各种措施。文章说：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会决定，要毫不动摇地继续执行社会主义工业化的政策，并以此作为党的主要方针。要在发展重工业的同时，保证增加消费品产量，迅速地发展农业，逐步地提高全体劳动人民的生活水平。
    本期还刊载了法国共产党中央委员让·普朗多的题为“发展法国与民主国家的贸易”一文。文章指出：由于法国的经济和政策屈从美国要求的结果，法国的对外贸易总额日益减缩，对外贸易逆差迅速增加。法国消除这种严重情况的唯一道路，就是恢复民族独立、结束越南战争、削减军事费用和恢复与一切国家进行自由贸易。文章着重地说明了扩大与民主国家的贸易对于法国工业、农业和劳动群众的好处，并指出：法国要在不久的将来恢复全面的对外贸易，有赖于法国人民争取独立和争取和平的斗争。（新华社）
