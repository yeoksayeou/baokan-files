Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 15th (By our special correspondent Wu Min) - This morning, a report was received stating that Red Cross personnel from the Korean-Chinese side were injured by so-called "guards" near the Imjin River bridge in Munsan. This incident followed the attack on Korean-Chinese Red Cross personnel with tear gas on Geoje Island, and has aroused public outrage here. The obstruction of Red Cross personnel from conducting visits in South Korea has escalated to the point of infringing on personal safety and injuring Red Cross personnel.

The injured Red Cross personnel have not yet returned here, but it is already known that they sustained injuries to their chest and legs. The Korean-Chinese Red Cross personnel have been consistently prepared to provide humanitarian services to prisoners of war near Munsan, in accordance with the terms of the armistice agreement.

The use of poison gas and the injury of Red Cross team members are clear violations of the armistice agreement, which stipulates that the commanders of each side are responsible for ensuring the safety of Joint Red Cross team members within their respective military control areas. These provocative incidents are part of a series of provocative actions that have been increasing recently, despite protests from the Korean-Chinese side.

The U.S. senior member of the Military Armistice Commission, General Bryan, has remained silent for five days regarding the strong protest made by General Li Sang-cho, who protested the collusion between the United States, Chiang Kai-shek, and Syngman Rhee to force Chinese prisoners of war on Jeju Island who were not directly repatriated to renounce their right to repatriation. The United Nations Command broadcast the proclamation of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, threatening prisoners of war that they should not demand repatriation, and distributed his photographs and photocopies of his proclamation in the prisoner of war camps.

In the nineteen days since the armistice, the United States has violated the armistice agreement forty-four times in the demilitarized zone. Thirty-five of these violations were committed by the U.S. Air Force. On the 12th alone, the U.S. Air Force violated the armistice agreement a record eight times.

Every day, returning Korean-Chinese prisoners of war have been subjected to injuries from poison gas, bayonets, etc., on their way to Panmunjom. Mothers and children were also attacked with poison gas on the train. This morning, returning Korean People's Army prisoners of war all bore injuries, and groups of South Korean thugs protected by U.S. guards in Incheon threw stones at them.

U.S. Secretary of the Army Stevens admitted that more than two hundred and fifty Chinese People's Volunteers prisoners of war were being held as hostages. Returning Chinese prisoners of war have provided names and evidence proving that they are all prisoners of war who firmly demanded repatriation. Some of these prisoners of war were sent to prison or placed in solitary confinement because they were representatives of prisoners of war who demanded repatriation. Many were forcibly dragged away from the prisoner of war camp just before the repatriation began.

These provocative actions and serious violations of the armistice agreement are occurring at the same time that the Americans are fabricating lies about the Korean-Chinese side mistreating prisoners of war, in order to create tension and obstruct the implementation of the terms of the armistice agreement. Dulles and Syngman Rhee agreed to sabotage the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the political conference by making unacceptable demands. In this situation, these fabricated stories take on serious significance. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 14th, Syngman Rhee said that South Korea was determined "to march north at the earliest possible time" to achieve unification.

All of these signs indicate that U.S. warmongers and Syngman Rhee are implementing a conspiracy of provocative actions to obstruct the implementation of the armistice agreement.

The world has already seen that the U.S. demand for Red Cross visits to prisoner of war camps is nothing more than a propaganda trick, just like its bloody demands for "voluntary repatriation" or "non-forcible repatriation." The U.S.'s "humanitarian consideration for prisoners of war" is to issue gas masks to the Joint Red Cross team when they visit prisoner of war camps. The world has an indelible impression of the American "humanitarians" who, wearing gas masks, attack and injure Red Cross personnel with tear gas while these Red Cross personnel are trying to carry out the tasks assigned to them by the armistice agreement within U.S. territory.

### 我红十字会人员被伤害和美方违反停战协定事件表明  美方好战分子企图阻挠停战协定的实施

    我红十字会人员被伤害和美方违反停战协定事件表明
    美方好战分子企图阻挠停战协定的实施
    【新华社开城十五日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：十五日早晨收到报告说，朝中方面的红十字会人员在汶山附近的临津江桥被所谓“卫兵”伤害。这件事是接着朝中方面的红十字会人员在巨济岛上遭到催泪性毒气的袭击之后发生的。这已在此间引起公愤。阻碍红十字会人员在南朝鲜进行访问的事件，已经发展到侵犯人身和伤害红十字会人员的程度。
    负伤的红十字会人员还没有回到这里，但是已经知道他们的胸部和腿部都受伤了。朝中红十字会的人员一直准备依照停战协定的条款对汶山附近的战俘给予人道的服务。
    用毒气袭击以及伤害红十字会小组的人员显然是违反停战协定的，停战协定中规定，各方司令官负责在其军事控制地区内保证联合红十字会小组人员的安全。这些挑衅事件是一连串挑衅行动中的一部分，尽管朝中方面提出抗议，这种挑衅行动最近却在继续增加。
    军事停战委员会的美方首席委员勃里安对李相朝将军提出的强烈的抗议，五天以来一直保持缄默。李相朝将军抗议美国—蒋介石—李承晚串通强迫济州岛上不直接遣返的中国战俘放弃他们被遣返的权利。联合国军司令部广播了卖国贼蒋介石的文告，威胁战俘要他们不要求遣返，并在战俘营散发他的照片和他的文告的影印版。
    在停战以来的十九天中，美国在非军事区违反停战协定的事件有四十四次之多。其中三十五次是美国空军违反停战协定的事件。在十二日一天当中，美国空军违反停战协定的事件达到八次的纪录。
    每天回来的朝中被俘人员在他们来板门店的途中一直遭受着毒气、刺刀等伤害。母亲和孩子们也在火车上受到毒气的袭击。今天早上回来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员都带着伤，在仁川受美国卫兵保护的一群一群的南朝鲜匪徒向他们投掷石块。
    美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯承认，有二百五十多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员被列为人质。回来的中国被俘人员提出了姓名和证据，证明他们都是坚决要求遣返的战俘。其中有些战俘被送进监狱或被单独监禁，因为他们是要求遣返的战俘代表。许多人都是在刚刚开始遣返之前从战俘营场里被强迫拉走的。
    这种挑衅行动和严重违反停战协定的事件正发生在美国人捏造朝中方面虐待战俘谎话的时候，以便制造紧张局势和阻挠停战协定条款的实施。杜勒斯与李承晚协议要在政治会议上用提出不能接受的要求来破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决。在这种情况之下，这些捏造的故事就有了严重的意义。按路透社华盛顿十四日的消息，李承晚说：南朝鲜决计“在尽可能最早的时候北进”，来达成统一。
    所有这些迹象都表明：美国的好战分子和李承晚正在实行一个进行挑衅行动的阴谋，来阻挠停战协定的实施。
    全世界已经看出，美国要求由红十字会访问战俘营只不过是一种宣传的把戏，正如它所曾经提出的充满血腥的“自愿遣返”或“不强迫遣返”的要求是一样的。美国“对战俘的人道主义的考虑”就是在联合红十字会小组访问战俘营的时候把防毒面具发给它。全世界对于带着防毒面具、用催泪性毒气袭击并伤害红十字会人员的美国“人道主义者”已有了不可磨灭的印象，而这些红十字会人员当时是在美方境内设法执行停战协定规定给他们的任务的。
