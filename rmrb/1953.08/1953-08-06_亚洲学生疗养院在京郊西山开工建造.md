Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: The Asian Students Sanatorium, commissioned by the International Union of Students to be built by the All-China Students' Federation, broke ground on August 5th in the western suburbs of Beijing. The sanatorium is planned to be a tuberculosis sanatorium with a capacity of 300 beds, and will accept Asian students for medical treatment after its completion. The site is located in the scenic Western Hills, a famous scenic spot in Beijing, about 20 kilometers from the city center, and not far from scenic spots such as the Summer Palace and Xiangshan. According to the design, the building is not only suitable for medical requirements but also has a beautiful Chinese national style. The sanatorium will have a fully equipped surgery department, X-ray room, laboratory, as well as cultural and recreational activity rooms, a library, outdoor sports equipment, and a beautiful garden.

The Asian Students Sanatorium was decided to be established by the International Union of Students based on the proposal of the All-China Students' Federation.
