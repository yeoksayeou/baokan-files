    The United States Intensifies its Expansion of Power in Iran
    In early March 1951, the pro-British Iranian Prime Minister Razmara was assassinated. The behind-the-scenes executioner was Grady, the then US Ambassador to Iran. Only two years and five months later, on August 15th and 19th of this year, the Iranian court clique, under the manipulation of US special agents, launched two military coups, overthrowing the Mossadegh government and arresting Prime Minister Mossadegh, in order to prop up a government that completely obeyed the will of the US ruling group. This shows that US imperialism is stepping up its expansion of power in Iran, while further squeezing out Britain's position in Iran, in order to seize control of Iranian oil.
    As everyone knows, Iran has very rich oil reserves, and its output ranks third among capitalist countries. Since the establishment of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) in 1909, Britain has monopolized control over Iran's oil resources. Since the end of World War II, the United States has begun to actively invade Iran. The United States believes that the growing movement of the Iranian people for national independence and demanding the nationalization of oil can be used to squeeze out Britain's influence in Iran. Therefore, on March 7, 1951, the pro-British Iranian Prime Minister Razmara, who opposed the nationalization of oil, was assassinated. The Iranian Parliament passed the nationalization of oil in March 1951. Subsequently, the United States, wearing the mask of a "mediator," constantly carried out conspiracies, attempting to replace Britain's position in Iran. Initially, former US President Truman sent special envoy Harriman to "mediate" the "British-Iranian oil dispute," suggesting that American experts be used to replace the British oil experts who had been expelled from Iran. Subsequently, the "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development," controlled by the United States, demanded that the Iranian government transfer the rights of the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to it.
    However, the Iranian people, who had initially driven out the British monopoly capitalists, of course firmly opposed the American monopoly capitalists from coming to control their economic lifeline again. Under the strong pressure of the national liberation movement of the Iranian people, the Mossadegh government did not completely succumb to the aggressive intentions of the United States. After more than a year of activities, US imperialism, seeing that it could not make the Iranian government yield on its own, had to turn to colluding with its opponent, British imperialism, which it wanted to squeeze out, and launched a joint offensive against the Iranian people.
    The United States, on the one hand, helped the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to put Iran in a position of extreme economic difficulty, and on the other hand, lured the Iranian government.
    At the end of August 1952, Truman and Churchill jointly sent a letter to Mossadegh, demanding that the Iranian government submit the issue of compensation for the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which was controlled by the US and British governments, on the condition that the United States would grant Iran a loan of ten million US dollars. In other words, the United States attempted to exchange Iran's sovereignty for ten million US dollars. On February 20th of this year, the United States again put forward demands similar to those of last August to Iran in the form of a "joint US-British proposal," only increasing the amount of the US loan from ten million US dollars to one hundred million US dollars, thinking that this would induce the Iranian government to yield.
    However, the joint offensive and lure of the US and Britain did not achieve their goals due to the resolute opposition of the Iranian people. The Mossadegh government did not completely succumb to the will of the United States.
    Therefore, the disappointed US ruling group wanted to support a government in Iran that could completely obey the US monopoly capital to replace the Mossadegh government.
    The United States decided to use the Iranian court as a tool to achieve this goal. The Iranian court, as the center of Iran's feudal forces, did not hesitate to sell out national sovereignty and national interests to maintain its crumbling, corrupt monarchical system. In July 1952, the Iranian court, under the manipulation of the United States, attempted to bring the notorious US lackey Ghavam to power to overthrow the Mossadegh government. However, under the angry opposition of the broad masses of the people, this conspiracy of the United States failed shamefully, Ghavam fled abroad, and Mossadegh resumed his post as Prime Minister.
    Since then, the US ruling group has continued to try to overthrow the Mossadegh government, which it considered not completely obedient to its will, by various means. Eisenhower blatantly used economic pressure in his letter to Mossadegh on June 29th of this year. He threatened that if Mossadegh did not reach an agreement with Britain on the oil issue according to the US plan, the United States would adopt a "reserved attitude" towards its aid to Iran. This ultimatum-style intimidation, which shamelessly interfered in the internal affairs of other countries, aroused extreme anger among the people of all strata in Iran.
    At the same time, American newspapers openly threatened the Mossadegh government with launching a coup in an attempt to force it to submit. The "New York Post" "predicted" on July 13th that the Mossadegh government would collapse within this year. It will be overthrown by the Iranian army, which has been supplied with modern weapons, advisors, and training personnel by the United States since 1947. The "New York Times" also reported on July 15th that the US, British, and French foreign ministers' meeting came to the "conclusion" that the Mossadegh government would collapse within this year based on "reports from US and British personnel in Iran."
    At this moment, in order to resist the sabotage activities of the Iranian court's foreign mercenary elements and a group of parliamentarians hindering the work of the parliament, the Mossadegh government began to hold a referendum on dissolving the lower house on August 3rd of this year. The result was that 2,044,596 people voted in favor of dissolving the lower house, and 1,207 people voted against it.
    Tehran newspapers pointed out that the result of the referendum made the Iranian court clique very panicked, and therefore stepped up preparations to overthrow the Mossadegh government. Schwarzkopf, the former US adviser to the Iranian Gendarmerie General Administration, suddenly arrived in Tehran and was immediately received by the Iranian King. Tehran newspapers reported that Schwarzkopf conveyed the instructions of the American masters to the conspirators, ordering them to launch a coup immediately.
    On the evening of August 15th of this year, Nasiri, commander of the Iranian King's Royal Guard, led armed forces to arrest Mossadegh. As a result, he himself was arrested by Mossadegh's guards. This coup failed quickly. The US ruling group immediately expressed great disappointment. US Ambassador to Iran Henderson also rushed back to Tehran from Iraq, declaring to Mossadegh that the United States would do everything in its power to obstruct his future governance, and at the same time suggested that he resign. On August 19th, the court clique launched a second military coup, first occupying some government buildings in Tehran and announcing that Major General Zahedi, a fascist who had colluded with Nazi Germany during World War II, was appointed as Prime Minister, and then arrested Mossadegh.
    After the failure of the court clique's first coup, the broad masses of the Iranian people expressed extreme anger at the new conspiracy of the United States and the court clique colluding with the United States. The people of Tehran held large-scale demonstrations, chanting "Down with the court's conspirators," "Long live the unified front of the Iranian people against the colonial system," and writing slogans such as "Yankees go home" on the streets. The purpose of the United States in supporting Zahedi this time is to step up the suppression of the Iranian national liberation movement to facilitate its pursuit of oil profits and the implementation of aggressive conspiracies. Obviously, this will surely arouse greater anger and opposition from the broad masses of the Iranian people who are fighting for national independence and against imperialism and feudalism. With Zahedi's rise to power, the United States will step up its expansion of power in Iran in order to realize its ambition to squeeze out Britain and completely control Iran, and therefore it will inevitably make its contradictions with Britain, which is trying to maintain its original position in Iran, more intense and apparent.

### 美国加紧扩张它在伊朗的势力

    美国加紧扩张它在伊朗的势力
    一九五一年三月初，亲英的伊朗首相拉兹马拉被暗杀了。暗杀的幕后刽子手是当时美国驻伊朗大使格拉迪。相隔不过两年五个月，伊朗宫廷集团于今年八月十五日和十九日，又在美国特务操纵下，发动了两次军事政变，推翻了摩萨台政府，逮捕了首相摩萨台，以便扶植一个完全顺从美国统治集团意志的政府。这表明：美帝国主义正加紧扩张它在伊朗的势力，同时进一步排挤英国在伊朗的地位，以夺取对伊朗石油的控制权。
    大家知道，伊朗石油蕴藏十分丰富，产量占资本主义各国的第三位。自从一九零九年英波（斯）石油公司（后改名为英伊石油公司）成立以后，英国一直就独占着对伊朗石油资源的控制权。第二次世界大战结束以来，美国开始积极侵入伊朗。美国对于争取民族独立的伊朗人民要求石油国有化运动的日益高涨，认为可加以利用来排挤英国在伊朗的势力，因此，一九五一年三月七日，反对实行石油国有化的亲英的伊朗首相拉兹马拉被暗杀了。伊朗议会在一九五一年三月通过了实行石油国有化。接着，美国就戴着“调解人”的假面具不断进行阴谋活动，企图取代英国在伊朗的地位。最初，前美国总统杜鲁门派了特使哈里曼去“调解”“英伊石油纠纷”，建议用美国专家来代替那些被赶出伊朗的英国石油专家。接着，又由在美国控制下的“国际复兴开发银行”要求伊朗政府把前英伊石油公司的权利转让给它。
    但是，已经初步赶走了英国独占资本家的伊朗人民，当然也坚决反对美国独占资本家再来掌握他们的经济命脉。摩萨台政府在伊朗人民的民族解放运动的强大压力下，没有完全屈从于美国的侵略意图。美帝国主义经过一年多的活动，眼看着不能单独使伊朗政府屈服，不得不转而与它所要排挤的对手英帝国主义勾结起来，向伊朗人民进行联合的进攻。
    美国一方面帮助前英伊石油公司使伊朗陷入经济极端困难的地位，一方面又对伊朗政府进行利诱。
    一九五二年八月底，杜鲁门和邱吉尔联名致函摩萨台，以美国给予伊朗一千万美元贷款为条件，要求伊朗政府把关于前英伊石油公司的赔偿问题交由美英政府把持的海牙国际法庭讨论，换句话说，美国企图以一千万美元来换取伊朗的主权。今年二月二十日，美国又以“美英联合建议”的方式向伊朗提出和去年八月建议相似的要求，只是把美国贷款的数目由一千万美元增加到一亿美元，以为这样就可以诱使伊朗政府屈服。
    但是，美英的联合进攻和利诱，在伊朗人民的坚决反对之下，都没有达到目的。摩萨台政府没有完全屈从美国的意志。
    于是，失望的美国统治集团就想在伊朗扶植一个能完全听命于美国垄断资本的政府，来代替摩萨台政府。
    美国决定利用伊朗宫廷为工具来达到这个目的。作为伊朗封建势力的中心的伊朗宫廷，不惜出卖国家主权和民族利益来维持它摇摇欲坠的腐朽君主制度。一九五二年七月间，伊朗宫廷就已在美国操纵下，企图使恶名昭著的美国走狗盖凡姆上台，推翻摩萨台政府。但在广大人民愤怒反对下，美国的这个阴谋可耻地失败了，盖凡姆逃往国外，摩萨台重任首相。
    从那时以后，美国统治集团仍继续力图用种种方法来推翻它认为不完全顺从它的意志的摩萨台政府。艾森豪威尔于今年六月二十九日露骨地在他给摩萨台的信中施用经济压力。他恫吓说，如果摩萨台不按照美国方案和英国在石油问题上达成协议，美国对它给伊朗的援助就将采取“保留态度”。这种无耻地干涉他国内政的最后通牒式的恫吓，激起了伊朗各阶层人民的极端愤怒。
    和这同时，美国报纸又公开以发动政变来恫吓摩萨台政府，企图迫使它就范。“纽约邮报”在七月十三日“预测”说，摩萨台政府将在今年内垮台。它将被自从一九四七年以来就由美国供给现代武器、顾问和训练人员的伊朗陆军推翻。“纽约时报”也在七月十五日报道，美、英、法三国外长会议根据“在伊朗的美英人士的报告”，得到了摩萨台政府将在今年内垮台的“结论”。
    正在这时候，摩萨台政府为了抵抗伊朗宫廷外国雇佣分子的破坏行动以及一批议员阻挠议会工作，在今年八月三日开始举行关于解散下院的公民投票，结果是二百零四万四千五百九十六人赞成解散下院，一千二百零七人反对。
    德黑兰报纸指出，公民投票的结果使伊朗宫廷集团非常恐慌，因而加紧推翻摩萨台政府的准备活动。前伊朗宪兵总署的美国顾问施瓦茨科夫忽然到达德黑兰了，并立即由伊朗国王加以接见。德黑兰报纸报道，施瓦茨科夫向阴谋者传达了美国主子的训令，要他们立即发动政变。
    今年八月十五日晚，伊朗国王御林军司令纳西里率领武装部队去逮捕摩萨台。结果他自己被摩萨台的卫兵逮捕了。这一次政变就这样很快失败了。美国统治集团立刻表示很失望，美驻伊朗大使汉德逊也从伊拉克赶回德黑兰，对摩萨台声明了美国将竭尽一切力量阻挠他今后执政，同时建议他辞职。八月十九日，宫廷集团又发动第二次军事政变，首先占领了德黑兰的一些政府建筑物，并宣布由在第二次世界大战中和纳粹德国相勾结的法西斯分子萨希迪少将任首相，接着又逮捕了摩萨台。
    在宫廷集团发动第一次政变失败后，伊朗广大人民曾对美国的新阴谋以及和美国勾结的宫廷集团表示极端愤怒。德黑兰人民举行了大规模示威，高呼“打倒宫廷的阴谋者”、“伊朗人民反对殖民制度，统一战线万岁”，并在街上写着“美国佬回去”等口号。美国这一次扶植萨希迪上台的目的，是要加紧镇压伊朗民族解放运动以便利它追求石油利润和推行侵略阴谋。很显然，这一定将激起为争取民族独立、反对帝国主义和封建制度而斗争的伊朗广大人民的更大愤怒和反对。随着萨希迪的上台，美国将加紧扩张它在伊朗的势力，以实现它排挤英国而完全控制伊朗的野心，因而也就必然会使它和力图保持在伊朗的原有地位的英国的矛盾更加激烈化和表面化。（新华社）
