Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd:

    Farmers across the country have worked hard to overcome various natural disasters, and following the bumper early rice harvest, other autumn grain crops are also showing signs of a good harvest. This situation indicates that there is hope for an increase in national grain production this year.
    Since July, some areas in the Central and South region, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces, have experienced drought. Farmers in these areas immediately and resolutely engaged in a struggle to combat drought and protect the autumn harvest. In Guangxi Province alone, farmers opened up water sources and built water conservancy projects, rescuing 560,000 mu of drought-stricken farmland. After rainfall in mid-August due to the impact of typhoons, the drought in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces was greatly alleviated, and the drought in most parts of Jiangxi Province and some parts of northern Hubei Province was basically eliminated. At present, mid-season rice has begun to be harvested in these provinces, and in general, the planned production increase can be completed, except for a few areas. The transplanting of late rice seedlings has also largely been completed, and some areas are weeding and applying fertilizer. More than 40 million mu of mid-season rice in Hunan Province can mostly achieve a good harvest; the Dongting Lake Plain can increase production by more than 10% compared to last year, and the Xiangxi area can increase production by 15% to 20%. Although some areas in Henan Province have suffered from waterlogging, sorghum and corn in most areas are five or six feet tall, and the millet in better areas is as tall as a person, with ears seven or eight inches long. Soybeans are already two feet tall and are flowering and podding. Most farmers in the province report that this year's autumn crops are the best they have seen in many years. Farmers in some areas are joyfully beginning to harvest early autumn crops.
    Since July, farmers in the East China region have waged a tenacious struggle against disasters such as waterlogging, drought, wind, and pests. In Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, party and government leading organs at all levels dispatched responsible cadres and a large number of staff to assist farmers in building water conservancy projects and diverting water for irrigation during the drought resistance and autumn protection efforts, which yielded great results. In mid-August, a strong typhoon hit the entire region, and cadres and farmers everywhere made great efforts to prevent and protect against the storm, reducing or avoiding losses; however, the rain brought by the typhoon was very timely, and the drought in various drought-stricken areas in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces has been basically eliminated or greatly alleviated. Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces have experienced excessive rainfall since mid-July, with waterlogging in some areas. After drainage and rescue efforts, the situation is gradually improving. Various localities have also paid attention to organizing forces to prevent and control pests such as autumn locusts, rice borers, and armyworms. At present, mid-season rice has begun to be harvested or is about to be harvested in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces and in the areas along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu and Anhui. Single-season late rice is bolting and heading, and the transplanting of double-season late rice is largely completed. Most areas of Anhui Province can complete the plan to increase production by more than 10%. Corn in mountainous and dry land areas has tasselled and formed cobs, and millet and sorghum are generally heading and bearing fruit. Sweet potatoes, soybeans, and mung beans are also growing vigorously. Spring soybeans have been harvested in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces. Early-maturing corn, sorghum, millet, etc., are being harvested in the northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces and the southern part of Shandong Province, where the northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces can increase production by about 10% compared to last year.
    In the North China region, some areas of Suiyuan Province experienced drought in late July, and it rained in mid-August. Some areas of Hebei Province experienced heavy rainfall and waterlogging in early August and are actively draining and rescuing crops. In terms of pest control, farmers in the central and northern parts of Shanxi Province, after a month of hard work, extinguished armyworms and continued to dig pupae, catch moths, and collect eggs to prevent the next generation of armyworms from occurring. At present, autumn grain crops are generally good in all provinces of the region. In the central part of Shanxi Province, sorghum and corn are more than one person tall and have generally tasseled; millet in the eastern Taihang Mountains is also more than half a person tall; and potatoes are growing luxuriantly in the northern part of the province. Many farmers in the province say that this year's autumn crops are the best since the national liberation.
    Farmers in the Northeast region are working hard and basically reversed the situation of "grass and seedlings growing together" in late July, extinguished the first generation of armyworms, and are continuing to prevent and control the second generation of armyworms. In mid-August, heavy rains fell in Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Jilin, Liaoxi, Liaodong, and other provinces, and many areas experienced river flooding and waterlogging. Farmers are working hard to rescue the crops. At present, more than 1.2 million hectares (15 mu per hectare) of spring wheat in the entire region have been largely harvested. The main wheat-producing areas of Songjiang and Heilongjiang provinces (the wheat fields of these two provinces account for about three-quarters of the total wheat field area in the region) have increased production by more than 10%. Sorghum and millet in various places have successively tasseled, and the southern region has begun to dry rice; corn has tasseled and formed cobs; soybeans have flowered and podded; and rice and other grain crops are growing vigorously.
    In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, summer rainfall was timely, and now the sorghum and corn on both sides of the Liao River and the Xin Kai River are six or seven feet tall, corn has tasseled and formed cobs, and soybeans are also more than one foot tall. In the Keerqin Right Wing Front Banner area of the Xing'an League, which has always been relatively arid, various autumn grain crops are also growing better than in previous years.
    Farmers in the Northwest region extinguished armyworms in July, allowing the affected autumn crops to quickly recover and grow. At present, more than 17 million mu of spring wheat in the entire region have been mostly harvested. The plain areas of Ningxia Province and the southern part of Xinjiang Province have increased production compared to last year, the area west of the Yellow River in Gansu Province has a flat harvest, and most areas of Qinghai and Gansu provinces have a poor year due to drought this year. Sorghum, corn, millet, millet, oats, etc., are growing very well. Early corn in Shaanxi Province is five or six feet tall, with plump and fertile cobs. Most of the three million mu of rice in Shaanxi, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Gansu, and other provinces are already two or three feet tall and have tillered; only a small number of rice plants are growing poorly due to late planting.
    Since late June, farmers in Guizhou, Yunnan, and other provinces in the Southwest region have launched a struggle to combat drought and protect the autumn harvest. In Guizhou Province, farmers actively built water conservancy projects and resisted drought to transplant rice seedlings during June and July. After widespread heavy rainfall in late July, the transplanting was completed. In early August, one-third of the province again experienced drought. Farmers again resisted drought, and the drought has eased in most areas after rainfall in mid-August. Farmers everywhere have also worked hard to prevent and control pests such as rice borers, rice leaf rollers, and armyworms. At present, mid-season rice in Sichuan Province is starting to be harvested, and late rice seedlings are already more than one foot tall; corn, sorghum, beans, etc., have also begun to be harvested. Corn and sorghum can increase production by 10% compared to last year, and soybeans and mung beans can maintain last year's production. Rice in Guizhou Province is generally in the stage of heading or heading, and rice in individual areas has turned yellow and begun to be harvested.

    今年全国大部地区秋粮可望增产
    【新华社二十三日讯】全国各地农民努力战胜各种自然灾害，继早稻丰收后，其他秋季粮食作物也呈现丰收的景象。这种情况表明今年全国粮食增产日有希望。
    中南区自七月份以来，广东、广西、江西、湖南、湖北等省都有一部分地区发生旱象，各地农民立即坚决地进行了抗旱保秋的斗争。仅广西省农民开辟水源，兴修水利，就解救了五十六万亩受旱田地。八月中旬受台风影响降雨后，广东、广西等省旱象大大减轻，江西省大部地区和湖北省北部部分地区旱象基本解除。现在，这些省份的中稻已开始收割，除少数地区外，一般都可完成预定的增产计划；晚稻插秧也已大部结束，有的正进行耘草、追肥。湖南省四千多万亩中稻大部可以丰收；洞庭湖滨平原可比去年增产一成以上，湘西地区增产一成半到二成。河南省虽有部分地区内涝，但大部地区高粱、玉米都有五六尺高，谷子较好的也和人一样高，穗长七八寸，大豆已有两尺高，正开花结荚。该省多数农民反映：今年秋禾是多年来没有见过的；部分地区农民正欢欣鼓舞地开始收割早秋作物。
    华东区农民七月份以来和水、旱、风、虫等灾害作了顽强斗争。福建、浙江两省在抗旱保秋中，各级党、政领导机关都派出负责干部和大批工作人员，并借出抽水机，帮助农民兴修水利和引水灌田，得到了很大的成绩。八月中旬强烈的台风侵袭全区，各地干部和农民都大力进行防范抢护，减少或避免了损失；但台风带来的雨却很适时，福建、浙江两省各受旱地区旱象已基本解除或大为缓和。山东、江苏、安徽三省七月中旬以来雨水过多，部分地区内涝，经过排水抢救，情况正逐渐好转。各地还注意组织力量，防治秋蝗、螟虫、黏虫等虫害。现在，福建、浙江两省和江苏、安徽的长江两岸地区中稻已开始收割或即将收割，单季晚稻正拔节孕穗，双季晚稻插秧大体结束。安徽省绝大部分地区中稻都可以完成增产一成以上的计划。各地山区和旱地的玉米已吐缨结棒，谷子高粱普遍抽穗结实，甘薯、大豆、绿豆也都很茁壮。福建、浙江、江苏、安徽等省春大豆已收完；江苏、安徽两省北部地区和山东省南部地区正在收割早熟的玉米、高粱、谷子等，其中江苏、安徽两省北部地区都可比去年增产一成左右。
    华北区绥远省部分地区七月下旬发生旱象，八月中旬下了雨。河北省部分地区八月上旬雨多内涝，正积极排水抢救。在防治虫害方面，山西省中部和北部地区农民经过一个月艰苦努力扑灭了黏虫，并继续挖蛹、捕蛾、采卵，防止下一代黏虫发生。现在，全区各省秋季粮食作物一般良好。山西省中部地区高粱、玉米有一人多高，已普遍吐穗；东部太行山区谷子也已半人多高；北部地区马铃薯生长繁茂。该省许多农民都说：今年秋庄稼是全国解放以来最好的一年。
    东北区农民紧张劳动，在七月下旬基本上扭转了“草苗齐长”的局面，扑灭了第一代黏虫，正继续防治第二代黏虫。八月中旬黑龙江、松江、吉林、辽西、辽东等省连降大雨，不少地区发生河流漫溢和内涝，农民正在大力抢救。现在，全区一百二十多万垧（每垧十五市亩）春小麦已大体收割完毕；主要产麦区松江、黑龙江两省（两省麦田面积合计占全区麦田总面积四分之三左右）比去年增产一成多和一成。各地高粱、谷子都先后吐穗，南部地区并开始晒米；玉米吐缨结棒；大豆落花结荚；水稻和其他粮食作物都在蓬勃成长。
    内蒙古自治区夏季雨水及时，现在辽河和新开河两岸的高粱、玉米高达六七尺，玉米已吐缨结棒，大豆也有一尺多高。在一向比较干旱的兴安盟科尔沁右翼前旗一带，各种秋季粮食作物也都比往年长得好。
    西北区农民在七月份扑灭了黏虫，使受害的秋庄稼都迅速恢复生长。现在，全区一千七百多万亩春小麦已大部收完，宁夏省平原地区和新疆省南部地区都比去年增产，甘肃省黄河以西地区平收，青海、甘肃两省大部地区因今年天旱而年景较差。各地高粱、玉米、谷子、糜子、燕麦等都长得很好，陕西省早玉米有五六尺高，结棒肥硕。陕西、宁夏、新疆、甘肃等省三百万亩水稻大多已有二三尺高，并已分蘖；仅少数水稻因播种较迟，生长较差。
    西南区从六月下旬以来，贵州、云南等省农民展开了抗旱保秋斗争。贵州省六七月间大部地区农民积极兴修水利，抗旱插秧，七月下旬普降大雨后，插秧全部完成；八月上旬全省三分之一地区又呈旱象，农民再次抗旱，中旬大部地区下雨，旱象已见减轻。各地农民还努力防治了螟虫、稻苞虫、黏虫等虫害。现在，四川省中稻正开始收割，晚稻秧苗已有一尺多高；玉米、高粱、豆类等也已开始收割，玉米、高粱可比去年增产一成，大豆、绿豆可保持去年产量。贵州省水稻一般正在孕穗或抽穗，个别地区的水稻已经黄熟，开始收割。
