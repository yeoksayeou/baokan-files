	Some Opinions on Feature Articles
	Soviet Union Saslavsky
	Comrades P. Vershigora, A. Akmova, and I. Forey published an article in the "Banner" magazine (Issue 3, 1953), offering a critical analysis of the Moldavian "October" magazine (Issues 1-6, 1952). The critics made the following comment: "'October' magazine rarely uses the most effective and militant style—the feature article—to elaborate on the life of the republic and the entire Soviet Union. The proportion of feature articles in 1952 was very small...".
	In fact, only six feature articles were published in the six issues of the magazine.
	However, suppose the authors of the critical analysis shifted their gaze from the Moldavian "October" magazine to the magazine publishing their article; what would they see? They would see that the "Banner" magazine, in its five issues of 1953, published only three feature articles on domestic life. This is even less than "very small".
	However, it cannot be said that "Banner" magazine lags behind other magazines in this regard; no, it is on par with "New World" and "Star" magazines, and it has surpassed the "October" magazine, which published two feature articles in five issues.
	It is very clear that the most militant and effective style has not yet earned its proper place in the magazines—a prominent, lasting, and firm place.
	Feature articles have also not won over large-sized type. According to an unwritten but deeply ingrained literary rule, feature articles should use small-sized type. No matter how bad a short story is, it is always printed in large type; no matter how good a feature article is, it will always be put in a gray, small, special garment. If, suddenly, Gleb Ivanovich Uspensky—the famous feature writer—himself unexpectedly appeared in our magazine's editorial department, then people would greet him with genuine joy and with unfeigned adoration. And, without a minute's delay, they would immediately write on his feature article manuscript: "Send to press immediately! Small-sized type." And send it to press.
	Is this a trivial matter? Yes, but as we will see, it is a very special triviality.

			×××

	The feature article can most effectively describe the current life of the Soviet Union. As a political commentary genre, the feature article is a chronicle of the Soviet people's heroic struggle and selfless labor.
	Suppose we consciously bring together ten feature articles; then, we will see a vivid, interesting, and fascinating picture. We will see the blast furnaces of Stalinsk, the machine manufacturing workshops of the Leningrad "Elektrosila" plant; we will see how oil gushes in Tatarstan, how new machines are laying forest trails in the Siberian wilderness, we will know what achievements the collective farmers of Kuban have made….
	However, there is a strange characteristic in this picture that is surprising and perplexing. We see the southern desert, we see Siberia, the Urals, the foothills of the Caucasus, but we do not see any of the central part of the great Russian plain. In general, feature articles are indeed "very few," and there are simply no feature articles about our central states. These areas are completely outside the field of vision of feature writers and magazine editors.
	The reason for this strange phenomenon is partly because the pictures of conquering unexplored nature, of overcoming natural forces, are most attractive to feature writers. It is also easier to find romance there, while this kind of romance is more difficult to find in old, long-inhabited areas. But you must know that even in the Orel and Smolensk regions, in the Kursk and Voronezh provinces, you can find great achievements, miracles, and romance in the daily, seemingly ordinary socialist labor. It's just that the romance here is not on the surface. You must observe for a long time and in depth, you must analyze the phenomena, and study the people.
	But the problem is not just that feature writers are infatuated with remote, unexplored regions where a great cultural struggle is taking place. The problem lies in the laissez-faire attitude towards feature articles, and the lack of planned leadership by the editors. The first issue of "Banner" magazine published Wei. Palyankov's feature article "Collective Farm Chairman," which mainly cited materials from the Krasnodar Krai; and in the fifth issue, the magazine published Mikhailov Kazartsev's feature article "In the Large Collective Farm," which again described this krai. How can such a situation be explained?
	"October" magazine published a total of two feature articles, and both were about Siberia, one was Alexander Otersky's "People of Stalinsk City" (Issue 4), and the other was V. Velichko's "In the Northern Forests." Why is it that only Siberia attracts the magazine's attention?
	We must not condemn the "Star" magazine for its lack of planning and system. The magazine editor firmly affirmed: Our business is Leningrad. Therefore, even the feature articles only publish about Leningrad, about how Stalin Avenue is being built, and about how magnificent machines are being manufactured by the outstanding technicians of the "Elektrosila" plant. Loving one's own city, especially when this city—Leningrad—is a great cause. But is this approach of the editors limiting the topic of feature articles correct?

			×××

	Soviet feature articles should get rid of superficial descriptions. But many of our feature articles lack analysis and critical components. There were reasons for this at the time—reasonable and unreasonable reasons. The reasonable one was: everything in the Soviet Union was new. Every achievement was gratifying. Feature articles mainly reflected current achievements. It did not look to the future, nor did it point out the shortcomings of today. This used to be the defect of feature articles themselves. The bad "theory of no conflict" even harmed our feature article work.
	At present, we see how feature articles are becoming more and more profound and more militant. Speaking of all the feature articles in the first five issues of various magazines in 1953, it can almost be said that they are all works with criticism and capable of raising questions. The authors, according to general rules, all took the instructions of the 19th Party Congress as their basic creative guidelines. Before Alexander Otersky—the author of the feature article "People of Stalinsk City"—before I. Osipov—the author of the feature article "Abundant Oil"—before Boris Ishaev—who wrote the feature article "The Power of Decision" about mastering new machines and about the designers and inventors of the "Elektrosila" plant—the questions of new machines and complete mechanization were raised; Wei. Palyankov raised the question of the connection between science and practice in socialist agriculture in the feature article "Collective Farm Chairman".
	However, the laissez-faire attitude in editing feature articles has damaged some good intentions. I. Osipov pointed out how oil fields use new pumping methods, pumping water into the mines under pressure in order to increase the underground pressure of oil and prolong the oil flow time. However, I. Osipov did not mention that the oil miners in actual operation had made reasonable demands to the scientific workers, requiring them to show due theoretical interest in this new method.
	Mikhailov Kazartsev, in his feature article "In the Large Collective Farm," raised the question that some large collective farms and some collective farmers seem to have nowhere to place their surplus grain. This is a problem, of course a local problem. When publishing this feature article in a national magazine, the editor should have considered whether the local problem was given a disproportionate tone….
	The field of the feature article genre is very broad. Its stylistic color is like a musical scale, starting from the literary feature article (sometimes no different from a short story) and ending with the political commentary feature article (sometimes no different from an essay). The majority are exactly the secondary feature articles that have content, are interesting, but a bit boring, and, unfortunately, obscure and uninteresting in language and style.
	All our feature articles attempt not only to show new phenomena in life, but also to show new people, but the portrayal of people is often not vivid enough and not powerful enough. We cannot particularly attribute this to the political commentary form of feature articles. Describing the images of people, understanding the unique characteristics of our innovators, builders, and scientists, not only in one area—mostly the production area, but also expressing the feature article characters from all aspects of personality—this is not an easy task. But we have the right to demand this of literary feature articles. Unfortunately, we often encounter unclear images and stereotypical descriptions in this kind of feature article.
	Anatoly Zlobin has the right to call his own creation "One Month in the Fifth District" a feature article, although the location of this district was not specified at the canal construction site, and the names of the characters seem to be fictional. This is a true literary feature article, and its vigorous vitality is convincing. The author uses direct realistic methods to describe it. The power of concreteness lies here. However, there is, after all, a legitimate basis for requiring people's names, place names, and requiring the literary pictures to be completely and accurately consistent with the facts. This basis is inseparable from the characteristics of the literary genre.
	In the above-mentioned works, the statue of District Chief Zhubtsov comes from the hand of a skilled writer. Zhubtsov belongs to the characters of yesterday, but he is hindering today. He is resolute, decisive, experienced, and meritorious, and he is satisfied with his existing achievements. But life is running ahead of him, the people around him have grown up, technology has grown up, but he is still the same old way. He tries to win achievements by any means: yelling, rude pressure, exaggerated indicators, adding false information to reports, playing tricks, and direct falsification. This will inevitably lead to inevitable bankruptcy.
	We believe that the character portrait is consistent with its original appearance. Anatoly Zlobin used fake names in order to avoid having to conform to the real situation in every detail. In this way, he portrayed a sharp typical artistic image of an individual character. However, in this feature article, we did not see that the author treated the positive character—Party Group Leader Novikov—in the same way. Novikov is fighting against Zhubtsov. This struggle can be more accurately called a solo duel. However, Novikov's portrait in the work is painted with too much seepage of paint, and the image is vague. This is an honest, fairly intelligent, but incompetent, actually clumsy leader. We cannot see a clear background and a clear perspective in Novikov's portrait: we cannot see the masses of party members in the Fifth District, nor can we see the party leadership organs of the district party organization.
	Suppose the real name of Novikov is called out and the address of the district is pointed out, then we will have no reason to doubt the factual and artistic authenticity of this feature article. Party workers like this are encountered, but Novikov's image is typified, and he is given to the reader with a positive sign. The author is very lenient with his weaknesses, and this uncertainty weakens the impression of this feature article.
	What should be especially regrettable is that the most important topic concerning the party as a guiding and leading force is not elaborated much and is weak in the so-called feature articles.
	Let's put aside the feature articles on international affairs for the time being. The topics of these feature articles are special and should be discussed separately.

			×××

	Alexander Popov's lengthy article "Academician Bekov and His Students" ("Star" magazine, Issue 3) is different from all feature articles. In terms of its intention, this is a scientific literary feature article, but in terms of its completion, it is a vulgarization of science and an anti-artistic distortion of the image of our outstanding scientists.
	The popularization of scientific achievements is the most important cause and the most difficult cause. The author should narrate scientific problems clearly, obviously, and easily understandable, but Popov is tirelessly verbose and talks very vaguely. The language is poor and lacks artistic symbolism.
	But poverty is not limited to this. Popov talked about the new work of Pavlov Elementary School, talked about Academician K. M. Bekov and young scientist Ya. A. Logov. He tried to expose the psychology of scientific exploration, and he also "psychologized" his feature article. This is manifested in that he always walks back and forth in front of five scientists and constantly shouts: Ah! How talented! Ah! How interesting! Oh, how difficult! Alas, what a talented person!
	This is both annoying and irritating.
	And what is the value of this kind of dialogue:
	Is your father a physicist? ——Bekov asked.
	No, he is a farmer——the college student answered with dignity.
	"A slow-witted person."——Bekov firmly decided this.
	Why should the son of a farmer be a slow-witted person?! Popov imposed his own nonsense on the academician.
	The editors of "Star" magazine, in this case, showed both a non-critical attitude towards bad feature articles and a weakness in artistic discrimination.

			×××

	Although the Soviet feature article is usually concerned at various writers' conferences, and although no one denies the most important significance of the feature article as a fighting and effective genre, in fact, the feature article still remains in the position of secondary literature, and it occupies a very small proportion in the magazines. It one-sidedly and weakly reflects the life of the Soviet people. Chance and laissez-faire are destined for the authors to make this choice. Many major issues concerning socialist construction, Soviet culture, and new ways of life still remain outside the magazine's field of vision. No matter how strange this is, it is precisely this fighting and effective genre like feature articles that still cannot meet the readers' requirements at this time. The new social upsurge and the new tasks that the Party has placed before the people require all the strength of literature and all the genres to most actively join the common cause. Resolutely changing the status quo and improving the leadership of feature articles—this is the unshirkable obligation of the Soviet Writers Association and its publishing institutions.

### 关于特写的几点意见

    关于特写的几点意见
    苏联  萨斯拉夫斯基
    普·凡尔舍果拉、阿·阿克摩娃、伊·福雷开三同志在“旗帜”杂志（一九五三年第三期）上发表文章，对一九五二年六期（一—六期）摩尔达维亚“十月”杂志进行了批判性的分析。批评家们做了这样的评语：“‘十月’杂志很少使用最有效的、最富有战斗性的文体——特写来阐述该共和国和全苏联的生活。一九五二年特写所占篇幅非常之少……”。
    实际上，六期杂志中只登载了六篇特写。
    但是，假设进行批判性分析的作者们将他们的视线从摩尔达维亚“十月”杂志转移到登载他们文章的这个杂志上来，会看到怎样的情况呢？他们就会看到，一九五三年五期“旗帜”杂志中只登载了三篇以国内生活为题的特写。这比“非常之少”还要少些。
    不过，决不能说“旗帜”杂志在这一点上落在其他杂志的后面，不，它与“新世界”和“星”杂志是并驾齐驱的，它赶过了五期中登载了两篇特写的
    “十月”杂志。
    非常明显，最富战斗性和最有效的文体还没有在杂志中争得应有的地位——显著的、恒久的和牢固的地位。
    特写也没争取到大号铅字。根据不成文的、但根深蒂固的文学上的规矩，特写应该使用小号铅字。无论多坏的短篇小说总是用大号活字刊印，无论多好的特写总会被套上一幅灰色的、细小的特殊装束。假若突然格列普·伊万诺维奇·乌斯宾斯基——著名的特写作家——本人出人意外地出现在我们的杂志编辑部，那么，人们会真正高兴地、以毫不虚假的爱戴来接待他。并且，一分钟也不耽延，立即将他的特写手稿批上：“立即付印！小号铅字。”拿去付印。
    这是小事吧？是的，但正如我们将看到的，这是很特别的小事。
            ×××
    特写能最有效地描述苏联的现时生活。作为政论体裁的特写是苏联人民英勇斗争和忘我劳动的史册。
    假设我们有意识地把十篇特写汇集在一起，那么，我们就将看见一幅鲜明的、有趣的、引人入胜的画面。我们将看见斯大林斯克的高炉，列宁格勒“电力”厂的机器制造车间，就将看见，鞑靼里的石油如何喷吐，新式机器在西伯利亚丛林里如何铺设林间小道，我们就将知道，库班的集体农民取得了怎样的成就……。
    但是，这幅画面里有一种奇怪的特点令人惊讶不解。我们看见南方的沙漠，看见西伯利亚、乌拉尔、高加索山麓，但一点也看不见伟大的俄罗斯平原的中部。一般说来，特写的确“非常之少”，而关于我们中部各州的特写简直就没有。这些地区完全落在特写作家和杂志编辑的眼界以外去了。
    发生这种奇怪现象的原因，一部分是因为征服未开垦的大自然的画面、战胜自然力的画面最能吸引特写作家。那儿也容易发现浪漫情调，而在老的、久已人烟稠密的地区这种情调就比较难于发现。但是要知道，就是在奥尔罗夫辛和斯摩列辛，在库尔斯克州和沃龙涅什州，也可以从日常的、似乎很平凡的社会主义劳动中发现巨大成就、奇迹和浪漫色彩。只是这儿的浪漫色彩不是浮在表面。必须长久和深入地观察，必须对现象加以分析，对人物加以研究。
    但问题并不仅仅在于特写作家们倾心于辽远的、未被开垦的地域，在这些地域上正进行着伟大的文化斗争。问题在于特写的自流现象，编辑对特写的领导缺乏计划。“旗帜”杂志第一期刊载了维·帕梁科夫的特写“集体农庄主席”，这篇文章主要是引用克拉斯诺达尔边区的材料；而在第五期，该杂志又刊载了米海依诺夫·喀扎尔切夫的特写“在大集体农庄里”，又是描写这个边区。这样的情况又怎样解释呢？
    “十月”杂志一共刊载了两篇特写，而两篇都是关于西伯利亚的，一篇是亚历山大·奥捷尔斯基的“斯大林斯克城的人们”（第四期），另一篇是维·维利奇科的“在北方的森林里”。为什么只有西伯利亚才吸引该杂志的注意呢？
    我们决不能谴责“星”杂志缺乏计划和系统。该杂志编辑坚决地肯定：我们的事业就是列宁格勒。因此连特写也只刊登有关列宁格勒的，刊登斯大林大街正如何建筑起来，“电力”厂的杰出的技师们正制造着多么堂皇的机器。热爱自己的城市，特别是当这个城市——列宁格勒——是一件伟大事业的时候。但是编辑限定特写题目的这种作法难道是正确的么？
            ×××
    苏联的特写应该摆脱表面的描写。但我们有很多特写都缺乏分析和批判的成份。当时在这一点上曾经有过它的理由——合理的和不合理的理由。合理的是：全苏联都是新鲜事物。每一件成就都曾令人欣喜。特写主要地反映了当前的成绩。它没有去注视明天，也不曾指出今天的缺点。这曾经是特写本身的缺陷。恶劣的“无冲突的理论”甚至也使我们的特写工作遭到了危害。
    目前我们看见特写正如何愈来愈变得更加深刻和更富有战斗力。谈到一九五三年各杂志前五期的所有特写，差不多都可以说：都是些有批判、能提出问题的作品。作者们按照一般的规则都以第十九次党代表大会的指示作为自己基本的创作方针。在亚历山大·奥捷尔斯基——特写“斯大林斯克城的人们”的作者——面前，在伊·奥西波夫——特写“大量石油”的作者——面前，在波黎斯·依沙耶夫——写的特写“决定的力量”中谈到掌握新机器，谈到“电力”厂的设计发明者——面前，都提出了新式机器和全部机械化的问题，维·帕梁科夫在特写“集体农庄主席”里则提出了社会主义农业中科学与实践相联系的问题。
    但是，在编辑特写时听其自然的态度使某些好的意图遭到了损害。伊·奥西波夫曾指明石油矿场如何使用新的抽汲法，在加压下将水汲入矿井，以便提高石油的地下压力并延长喷油时间。但伊·奥西波夫没提到实际操作的石油矿工们曾向科学工作者提出过合理的要求，要求他们对这一新方法表现应有的理论方面的兴趣。
    米海依诺夫·喀扎尔切夫在他的特写“在大集体农庄里”提出某些大集体农庄和某些集体农民好像无处安置余粮的问题。这是一个问题，当然是一个地方性的问题。刊载这篇特写在全苏杂志上的时候，编辑本应考虑一下，是否给地方性的问题配上了不相称的声调……
    特写体裁的领域非常广阔。其风格色彩有如音阶，起自文艺特写（有时与短篇小说无异），终于政论特写（有时与论文无异）。而占大多数的恰恰是大体上尚有内容、有趣味，但有点枯燥，并且，可惜的是，语言和风格都是晦涩乏味的次等特写。
    我们所有的特写都企图不仅要显示生活中新的现象，也要显示新的人物，但人物的表现常常不够鲜明，不够有力。我们不能把这一点特别归咎于政论形式的特写。描写人物形象，体会我们的革新者、建设者和科学家所独具的特点，不仅在一个范围——多半是生产范围，而且也从个性的各方面来表现特写角色——这不是一件容易的事。但我们有权这样要求文艺特写。可惜，就在这种特写中我们常遇见形象模糊不清的情况和刻板式的描述。
    阿那托利·兹洛宾有权将他自己的创作“在第五区的一个月”称之为特写，虽然这一区的地点在运河的建筑工地上没指出来，而人物的名字看起来也是虚构的。这是一篇真正的文艺特写，它的蓬勃生气具有说服力。作者是直接用写实方法描写的。具体性的力量就在这里。但是，要求人名、地名，要求文艺画面完全地确实地符合事实，毕竟有其合法的根据，这种根据是与文艺体裁的特性分不开的。
    上述作品中区长茹布错夫的塑像出之于谙练的作家之手。茹布错夫是属于昨天的人物，但他阻碍着今天。他刚毅果断，有经验，有功劳，他满足于已有的成绩。但生活跑在他前面了，他周围的人们已经成长起来，技术已成长起来，而他还是原来的老样子。他试图不择手段地用：吆喝、粗暴的压力、夸大的指标、汇报中虚加补充、玩诡计、直接假造等来赢得成绩。这一定要导致不可避免的破产。
    我们相信，人物肖像是符合本来面目的。阿那托利·兹洛宾使用假的人名，是为了避免在各个细节上都要与真实情况相符，这样，他对个别人物刻划了一幅尖锐的典型的艺术形象。但是，在这篇特写中我们没看出作者也同样地对待正面人物——党小组长诺维科夫。诺维科夫与茹布错夫进行斗争，这种斗争准确些说可以称之为单独决斗。但作品中诺维科夫的肖像是用渗水过多的颜料涂成的，形象模糊不清。这是一个诚实的、相当聪明的，但缺乏能力，实际上是笨手笨脚的领导者。我们在诺维科夫的画像里看不见鲜明的背景和清楚的远景：既看不见第五区的党员群众，也看不见区党组织上的党领导机关。
    假设叫出诺维科夫的真实名字并指出区的地址，那么，我们就不会有理由怀疑这篇特写事实上和艺术上的真实性。像这样的党的工作者是碰得见的，但诺维科夫的形象被典型化，而且他是被带着正号交给读者的。作者对他的弱点非常宽大，这种不定性削弱了这篇特写给人的印象。
    尤其应该抱歉的就是：最重要的有关党作为指导和领导力量的题目在所谓的特写中阐述不多，而且无力。
    我们姑且把以国际事务为题的特写搁在一边。这些特写的题目特殊，也应该特别地加以论述。
            ×××
    亚历山大·波波夫斯基的冗长文章“院士贝科夫和他的学生”（“星”杂志第三期）与所有的特写都不相同。就其意图说，这是一篇科学文艺特写，就其完成情况看，却是将科学庸俗化，并将我们杰出的科学家的形象反艺术地歪曲了。
    科学成就的普及是最重要的事业，也是最艰巨的事业。作者应该清楚、明显、容易令人了解地来叙述科学问题，波波夫斯基却令人厌倦地喋喋不休，谈得非常含糊。语言贫乏，毫无艺术象征。
    但贫乏不仅止此。波波夫斯基谈到巴夫洛夫小学的新的劳作，谈到院士科·姆·贝科夫和年青的科学家亚·亚·洛果夫。他企图揭穿科学探寻的心理，他将他的特写也“心理学化”。这表现在他总是在五个科学家面前走来走去，并且不断地高呼：啊！多么有天才呀！啊！多么有趣呀！哦呀，多艰难哟！哎呀，怎样有才干的人啊！
    这既令人讨厌，也令人生气。
    而这种对话又有甚么价值呢：
    你的父亲是物理学家么？——贝科夫问道。
    不，是庄稼人——大学生尊严地回答。
    “头脑迟缓的人。”——贝科夫坚决地这样决定。
    为甚么庄稼人的儿子应该是头脑迟缓的人？！波波夫斯基将他自己的胡言谰语加之于院士身上。
    “星”杂志编辑在这种情况下既表现了对坏的特写不加批评的态度，也表现出艺术鉴别力的薄弱。
            ×××
    虽然在各种作家会议上通常都很关心苏联的特写，虽然没有人否认特写是战斗的有效的体裁这一最重要的意义，但事实上特写仍然停留在次等文艺的地位上，它在杂志中所占篇幅非常之少。它片面地、软弱无力地反映着苏联人民的生活。偶然性和自流现象注定作者们作此选择。许多重大的有关社会主义建设、苏联文化、新的生活方式诸问题仍然停留在杂志视野之外。无论这多么令人奇怪，但，正是像特写这种富有战斗力和有效的体裁，仍不能满足读者在这时期的要求，新的社会高涨和党摆在人民面前的新的任务要求文学的全部力量和所有的体裁都最积极地加入共同的事业。坚决地改变现状，改善对特写的领导——这是苏联作家协会及其出版机关责无旁贷的义务。（李淑君译自一九五三年六月七日苏联“真理报”）
