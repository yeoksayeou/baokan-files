Resolution of the 15th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany

    The resolution of the 15th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held from July 24 to July 26, 1953:

    In view of its significant responsibility to accelerate the establishment of German unification, safeguard European peace, and improve the welfare of the people of the German Democratic Republic, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, on June 9, 1953, through a resolution by the Politburo, and from June 21 onwards by the Central Committee, suggested changing the political direction of the German Democratic Republic. The government has adopted this suggestion, and since June 11, the Council of Ministers has successively issued decrees based on the new direction. The reason for adopting this new direction is to genuinely improve the economic and political conditions of the German Democratic Republic in the near future and, on this basis, significantly raise the living standards of the working class and all working people. We will increase the production of the food industry, civilian industry, and light industry, while reducing heavy industry production, leveraging the positive role of private industrial and commercial enterprises, and increasing agricultural production. This will improve the material living conditions of the people. The life of the entire public will be further democratized, and exchanges between the people of East and West Germany will be more convenient. These measures are also taken for a great national goal: to strengthen the forces of peace and promote German unification.

    The implementation of this policy has already produced considerable results:

    Workers' wages have been increased, administratively imposed production quotas have been abolished, wages for workers in grades one to four have also been increased, tram and bus fares have been reduced again, the recently implemented restrictions on social insurance relief payments have been cancelled, pensions have been increased, and many remedial measures have been taken to overcome various shortcomings in factories; the government has decided to allocate funds and materials to greatly expand the housing construction plan.

    The amount of grain delivered by farmers to the state has been reduced, and loans have been obtained, which creates conditions for the development of agriculture; the property of small farmers, rich peasants, and private small industrial and commercial operators who had left their farms and businesses has been returned; those who had previously left the republic have received assurances of assistance to help them return and guarantees that their property will be returned to them; measures have been taken to develop the creative activities of intellectuals.

    The issuance of inter-district passports has been relaxed, and many restrictions on private merchants, artisans, and small business owners have been lifted; loans have promoted their business initiative.

    Measures have now been taken to increase the supply of materials to the entire people, to reissue ration cards to some people whose rations had been cancelled, to implement price reductions, and the supply situation has been tangibly improved.

    Due to the government's measures to increase the wages of some people with lower incomes, increase pensions, reduce the retail prices of some food and industrial products, and adjust taxes on artisans and private enterprises, the purchasing power of the people of the German Democratic Republic will increase by 2 billion marks this year.

    The state has taken prudent measures to eliminate tensions between the state and the church.

    The democratic rule of law has been strengthened, and some people who were sentenced to imprisonment for minor crimes have been released.

    These measures are the first steps taken by the Party and the government to implement the new policy, which will become the Party's long-term political direction. Its aim is to strengthen the struggle for peace, unification and prosperity.

    The Fascist Provocation of June 17th

    The government's announcement of the implementation of the new policy made the warmongers and enemies of German unification furious and panic-stricken. They realized that this new policy would greatly hinder their implementation of criminal war plans and the Bonn War Treaty, so they decided to implement their long-prepared "Day X" plan to sabotage the new policy. Therefore, the Fascists decided to carry out riots on June 17th and 18th, which were determined by the international situation.

    The continuous consolidation of the peace, democracy and socialism camp has been obvious for quite some time. Its strength is growing all over the world. The influence of the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy is also growing. This is particularly evident in the following aspects: Due to the Soviet Union's initiative, international tensions are easing, the movement to strive for understanding between the major powers is growing, progress has been made in the Korean armistice negotiations, the world peace movement has greatly developed after the World Peace Council held an encouraging meeting in Budapest, and resistance within the capitalist camp against American domination is increasing.

    The easing of international tensions has led millions of people to the conclusion that all outstanding international issues can be resolved peacefully through consultation.

    However, this development is contrary to the interests and intentions of American arms monopolists. Therefore, the reactionary groups in the United States are doing everything possible to obstruct the easing of tensions, complicate matters, and intensify the current situation. Precisely because of this, they launched two attacks on world peace in two different parts of the world on almost the same day.

    An agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war had just been signed in Panmunjom when, under the orders of the American puppet Syngman Rhee, a large number of soldiers of the Korean People's Army were "released" on the evening of June 17 in violation of the repatriation terms of the agreement. They were prisoners in the Masan, Busan and other POW camps under the administration of the US military command, who should have been handed over to a commission composed of neutral nations for protection. The purpose of this provocative action was to sabotage the conclusion of the Korean armistice agreement.

    Almost simultaneously, Fascist provocateurs who had received weapons, petrol bombs and necessary instructions from American officers attempted to incite Fascist riots in the democratic districts of Berlin. At the same time, in several other cities of the German Democratic Republic, organized secret agents who had been hiding for some time came out into the open and organized Fascist disturbances. They received operational instructions from the American RIAS radio station. The exposure of the imperialist agent Beria revealed the international connections of this large-scale provocative action. The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany thanks the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for its timely exposure of the traitor Beria. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany expresses its unwavering faith in the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and expresses its unwavering solidarity with the party of Lenin and Stalin.

    The West German monopoly capitalists and Junkers, as aides to American imperialism, played an important role in preparing the Fascist riots of June 17. Since the workers established power in the German Democratic Republic and the property of the monopoly capitalists and Junkers was confiscated, these guys who hold power in West Germany have been waging a desperate struggle in an attempt to restore capitalist rule in the German Democratic Republic. In order to sabotage the people's power, sabotage the peaceful construction of the German Democratic Republic, and seize the workers' factories and the farmers' land, they can commit any crime. Adenauer and Kaiser and their political tools openly talked about such a day. These reactionaries particularly hate the leading force in building a people's democratic regime - the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

    The provocation of June 17 reflected the attempt of the West German monopoly capitalists and Junkers. On this day, the Fascist provocateurs called on the people to overthrow the government of the German Democratic Republic and restore the power of the big capitalists and Junkers.

    The Fascists' attempt to create riots on June 17 has failed. The majority of the people of the German Democratic Republic, especially the working class, not only did not support the provocateurs, but strongly opposed them. The general strike planned and announced by the insurgents failed because the vast majority of workers did not participate. Only 5 percent of the republic's workers participated in the strike. Workers in many important factories in the republic, such as the Marx Foundry in Unterwellenborn, the Rauchhammer Coking Plant, the Bohlen Steel Plant, the "Wilhelm Pieck" Rayon Factory, the "Otto Grotewohl" United Factory in Bohlen, the Sicura Factory in Berlin, the Klingenberg Power Plant in Berlin, the Plameco Factory in Plauen, and many other factories, expressed their opposition to the provocateurs by strengthening labor discipline and increasing production. The vast majority of the working intellectuals also firmly supported the government. The provocateurs also encountered the same opposition among the peasant masses. In most cities and factories, the organizations of the Socialist Unity Party led the workers to resolutely oppose the provocateurs and put out the conspiracy riots. The opposition of the majority of the people to the provocateurs was the main reason for defeating the Fascist insurgents on June 17.

    The state organs of the republic and the Soviet occupying forces, especially the latter, played a decisive role in suppressing the Fascist war provocation. The June 17 riots failed. This failure proves that the democratic system of the German Democratic Republic is unshakable because it is supported by the majority of workers.

    However, the Party must learn from the events of June 17 and must quickly overcome the shortcomings in the Party's work that were exposed on that day.

    The events of June 17 show that there is a US-organized and supported Fascist underground activity within the German Democratic Republic. On this day, groups of enemies of the people ran out from hidden places and created riots in some cities, such as Magdeburg, Halle, Görlitz and other cities. The illegal Fascist organizations and their central organs, as well as their regular contact system with the West Berlin intelligence agencies, were exposed.

    Former Nazis played a major role. For example, this was the case in Department G-32 of the Buna factory, where a Fascist center created riots in accordance with instructions issued by the American RIAS radio station. In the Leuna factory, a former SS member led the provocation. In these large chemical factories, the heads of the provocateurs were agents of the Farben enterprises.

    In addition, in several cities, such as Magdeburg, Leipzig and other cities, there are also illegal organizations of former Social Democratic Party members, who still believe in anti-worker social democracy. Therefore, they easily became prisoners of the infamous "Eastern Bureau" (a West German agency specializing in leading espionage and sabotage activities against democratic Germany - translator), which spread Fascist slogans among workers and organized strikes. Honest workers who were formerly members of the Social Democratic Party did not realize that they were acting against the interests of their own class and against the original ideals of the German workers' movement.

    The workers who participated in the strike in fact supported the provocateurs. Their actions violated the interests of their own class, because the purpose of the Fascist provocation was to overthrow the working class regime in the German Democratic Republic and restore the capitalist system of exploitation. Therefore, this is a fatal threat to the working class.

    Recently, we hastily took many administrative measures to increase production quotas. These measures were not carefully considered and distorted the policy of strict economy, resulting in a reduction in the living standards of some workers and causing dissatisfaction among the workers. Alien elements managed to infiltrate certain administrative organs and steal the leadership of certain trade unions. They took anti-worker measures to deliberately create dissatisfaction, such as lowering wages, refusing to issue work clothes to protect labor safety, violating labor protection regulations, and ignoring the social needs of workers, etc.

    The events of June 17 caused the rise of hostile anti-democratic forces in the ideological, political and economic spheres. They put forward various demands in different forms aimed at weakening the democratic system of the German Democratic Republic and gradually eliminating it. The task of the Party is to resolutely oppose the revival of these hostile forces and expose their anti-people nature.

    After the failure of the provocation, the enemy attempted to prevent the democratic state organs from rounding up their organizations.

    Former Minister of Justice Max Fechner has been proven to have committed anti-state crimes. He used his position to protect Fascist provocateurs from the severe punishment they deserved. Under his instructions, many active organizers of hostile actions were released. He instructed the judicial organs to release all American agents and leaders of provocations without exception. This was direct and intentional assistance to the enemy—American and West German intelligence organizations and Fascists.

    As Minister of Justice, he is also responsible for countless unjust and severe judgments against workers in the republic.

    The Central Committee decided to expel Fechner from the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party and from the Party as an enemy of the Party and the state.

    The attempt by the enemies of the German people, the Party and the government to launch provocations to sabotage the implementation of the new policy has failed.

    The Socialist Unity Party of Germany and its representatives in the government of the German Democratic Republic will work even harder in the future to implement the new policies adopted in accordance with the resolution of the Council of Ministers of June 9. The most urgent task facing the Party Central Committee and all Party organizations is to eliminate all shortcomings.

    The New Policy and the Party's Tasks in Economic Life and the State

    The main content of the new policy is to fundamentally improve the economic and political situation of the German Democratic Republic, and on this basis, to significantly improve the living standards of the working class and all working people in the republic.

    It is only possible to complete the above tasks by comprehensively increasing the industrial and agricultural production of the German Democratic Republic, relying on the fraternal assistance given by the great socialist Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and developing internal and international trade.

    The completion of this main task will further strengthen the forces of the international peace, democracy and socialism camp, and will be a concrete contribution to the reunification of Germany.

    First of all, it is necessary to ensure a large increase in the supply of food and industrial products to the workers. In order to achieve this goal, trade must be developed in such a way that more mass consumer goods of the best quality can be sold. The Party's past policy of cutting consumer goods prices will continue to be implemented. Preparations will be made to completely abolish the rationing system. Economic life should be changed in such a way that no unemployment is generated.

    The following measures will be taken to accomplish these important tasks of the new policy: the Five-Year Plan and the 1953 Economic Plan will be revised in accordance with the policy of limiting heavy industrial investment to increase consumer goods production.

    Heavy industrial production will only increase by about 5.5 to 6 percent, while the original plan stipulated an increase of 13 percent. Light industrial production will increase by nearly 9 percent, while the original plan stipulated an increase of only 7.1 percent.

    In 1954 and 1955, total industrial output will increase by an average of 7 percent per year. Production of the means of production will increase by about 5 percent each year, and production of consumer goods will increase by about 10 percent each year.

    Handicraft production will increase by 10 percent each year. Private industrial production will also increase compared to 1953.

    Investments in the steel industry, mining industry, machine manufacturing industry, chemical industry, and building materials industry in 1954 and 1955 will be significantly reduced compared to the figures stipulated in the Five-Year Plan.

    Investments in expanding power, coal, transportation and agricultural production equipment will not be reduced. Production equipment for light industry, food and grain industry will be expanded.

    Building work will be expanded.

    In 1954 and 1955, the grain harvest per hectare of land will be higher than the figures stipulated in the Five-Year Plan.

    In terms of livestock breeding, it is necessary to make the number of livestock reach the figures stipulated in the Five-Year Plan as much as possible. Pig raising will exceed the figures stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. Special attention will be given to shortening the fattening period and increasing the slaughter weight of pigs.

    Machine tractor stations will be equipped with more tractors and agricultural machines.

    The volume of retail trade will increase more than the figures stipulated in the Five-Year Plan to accommodate the increase in people's purchasing power. This will also significantly increase the volume of goods sold by private businesses.

    According to the resolution of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the next task to be completed is to increase the volume of goods sold by about 30 percent in the second half of this year compared to the first half of the year. Among them, the sales volume of food and grain must increase by at least 25 percent, and the sales volume of industrial products must increase by nearly 40 percent. Organize the struggle to fully complete the economic plan. The higher the production, the higher the living standards of the masses. In order to achieve this, it is particularly important to ensure the smooth progress of production organization and technical procedures and to ensure the continuous smooth progress of the labor process. In order to supply the market with more and better goods, it is necessary to ensure a continuous supply of raw materials to factories and to continuously improve productivity and improve the implementation of labor discipline. The most important method to achieve this is to launch a broad competition movement in all sectors of the state-owned economy. It is necessary to continue to launch the struggle to implement the economic accounting system and strict economy system to reduce prices. Step-by-step reduction of various miscellaneous expenses will increase the profits of state-owned factories. In agriculture, the most important task at present is to complete the harvest work without loss in order to improve the people's living standards. First of all, it is necessary to mobilize the masses of farmers to complete the harvest work without loss, and to closely cooperate with state organs, machine tractor stations, state unified procurement organizations, and farmers' mutual aid associations to improve the organization of harvesting and sales. The machines of the machine tractor stations must be fully utilized by means of shift work and improved organization. In the countryside, the work of harvesting, threshing and sales cooperative organizations must be improved, and at the same time, the creative initiative of the working people should be brought into play. It is necessary to mobilize a large number of people from the cities to help with the harvest through mass organizations and the National Front of Democratic Germany. Workers in state-owned factories and staff in administrative agencies should conclude contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and implement these contracts. The purchasing departments of the State Joint Purchasing Organization must find ways to ensure the smooth progress of the purchasing of agricultural products. In implementing the new policy, one of the tasks in agriculture is to encourage and support individual farmers who have already received considerable assistance from the state. This assistance should first be given to small and medium farmers, but rich peasants can also receive loans and other assistance from the state to develop their estates. Special attention must be paid to livestock breeding. Pasture areas must be expanded according to the livestock breeding plan. The state will continue to help agricultural production cooperatives, and special attention will be paid to consolidating agricultural production cooperatives economically. The principle of voluntariness will be strictly observed. Machine tractor stations will be better equipped, especially with machines (seeders, fertilizer spreaders, cultivators, etc.) that can ensure further mechanization of those time-consuming and labor-intensive operations to meet the requirements of individual farmers and agricultural production cooperatives. It is particularly important to provide machine tractor stations, agricultural production cooperatives, and individual farmers with various (agricultural) machine parts on time.

    In order to implement the new policy, important tasks must be completed in trade.

    State and cooperative trade will be further developed. The initiative of private business will be brought into play on a broad basis.

    Trade organizations will fight to improve the quality of goods, increase the variety of goods, improve the quality and quantity of sales work, rationally distribute goods, and make goods available to consumers as quickly as possible.

    It must be determined what the people need. In this regard, every encouragement will be given to the initiative of retailers.

    Bureaucracy and mechanical distribution of goods must be eradicated forever. The distribution of goods will be planned correctly and in detail. The city and district councils must take full responsibility for supplying the people with goods. They must pay special attention to supplying workers' districts and small and medium-sized workers' cities.

    In order to further encourage the development of farmers' markets, it is stipulated that all farmers have the right to participate in these markets.

    State organs will also further develop wholesale trade between regions. Regional wholesale trade is responsible for the exchange of locally produced agricultural products, industrial products and handicrafts with the goods needed locally. Private wholesale trade will be conducted within the scope stipulated in the plan and contract.

    All trade organs—state-owned, cooperative, and private—must fully cooperate and allocate goods stored by local state-owned and private industries, as well as handicrafts and agriculture, to meet the needs of the people.

    In order to enable the Ministry of Commerce and Supply to provide instructions and exercise effective control on all basic issues related to commerce and supply, measures will be taken to strengthen the leadership of those state-owned trade organs that are responsible for supplying the people with food, textiles, shoes and industrial products.

    The Ministry of Commerce and Supply must ensure the unified management of all trade in the future and ensure that its work is carried out according to plan. It shall be responsible for implementing the trade policy of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

    Regarding financial issues, financial measures, especially further price reductions and tax cuts, must be used to improve people's living standards. In order to achieve this goal, strict discipline must be implemented on all financial issues, accelerate the circulation of money in the economy, reduce administrative expenses, and implement a strict economy system in all economic and administrative departments.

    Further strengthening the democratic order and strictly abiding by democratic laws is an important part of the new policy. The most important task in this regard is to bring the entire administrative organization closer to the masses and establish close ties with them. The necessary condition for completing this task is to eliminate the method of handling problems simply by administrative means and to launch a constant struggle against bureaucracy. Criticism and self-criticism will be encouraged. This will help bring into play the initiative of the masses in assisting to improve the work of state organs. Every complaint of the people must be dealt with.

    At the same time, the power of the state must continue to be strengthened so that it can become a powerful weapon to protect the rights and laws of citizens. Vigilance needs to be heightened against the enemies of democratic construction.

    The work of the People's Chamber and all other people's representatives needs to be changed and strengthened. The committees of the People's Chamber shall meet regularly to carefully discuss all draft laws and listen to the reports of ministers and deputy ministers. Moreover, the standing committees and municipal committees of village and district councils must play a more active role than in the past. They must be more concerned about the laws of the republic, explain these laws to the people, and implement these laws with the assistance of the people.

    The plenary meetings of the parliamentary bodies must more actively fulfill their obligations stipulated in the constitution.

    The connection between representatives and voters must be strengthened. The representatives must play a greater role than in the past. They must regularly hold consultation meetings, regularly make reports, listen to the wishes and instructions of the voters, and report whether these wishes and instructions have become reality.

    New life must be given to the Democratic League. The central organs of the Democratic League, as well as the work in villages, districts, and public organizations, will be strengthened. Democratic parties and mass organizations must strive to increase and strengthen cooperation with the Democratic League in order to strengthen the democratic order of the German Democratic Republic and improve the people's living standards. Strengthening the work of the League will encourage progressive forces. Strong support must be given to their struggle against reactionaries. These reactionaries are hidden in some parties of the League. Since June 17, they have actively made anti-republican remarks.

    Democratic laws must be strictly observed. Any attempt to violate the constitutionally protected rights of citizens by means of coercive administrative measures must be severely punished by law. The work of judicial organs, people's police, and other administrative organs of the state must be improved in this way. In their work, they must take measures to oppose all enemies who undermine our state order, Fascist provocateurs, and war instigators in order to protect the rights of workers.

    In cultural terms, the new policy is to further cultivate the creators of national culture. In particular, progressive science and art must be further rewarded, and the free creative activities of scientists and artists must be protected. National traditions and the heritage of German culture must be cherished. Friendship between literary and art workers of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries must be enhanced. The great achievements of Soviet science and art must be carefully studied and evaluated in accordance with the specific conditions of Germany. At the same time, exchanges between literary and art workers of the German Democratic Republic and West Germany must also be promoted. Primary schools, vocational schools, and universities must provide students with better and more suitable education, and ensure that experts in industry, agriculture, administration, and cultural life with high levels are trained by opening new universities and expanding existing universities. In art and literature, the struggle to support realism and oppose all anti-national, anti-democratic and decadent manifestations must continue. At the same time, artists and writers must be carefully and patiently persuaded with the Party's views on the development of art and literature. Under no circumstances should administrative means be used to force them to accept this view.

    In consolidating democratic laws and institutions, an important task is to train the staff of state and economic institutions so that they can implement the new policy. Our system only allows the existence of such staff members who have specialized knowledge and energetically and scientifically implement the government's decisions and instructions without acting arbitrarily. They must not shirk their responsibilities. They must strictly abide by the law, and at the same time have an open mind and care about the needs and sufferings of the people. Not listening to the people's complaints, taking a cold, bureaucratic attitude towards them, using official jargon, being careless and taking a perfunctory attitude towards things - all of this cannot be tolerated in performing the duties of state and economic institutions of the German Democratic Republic.

    Therefore, it is necessary to train the old staff members of state and economic institutions and educate new staff members so that they understand this. This work must not be delayed.

    At the same time, the purpose of the new policy is also to strengthen the forces of peace and promote German unification. The necessary prerequisite for establishing German unification is that the people of East and West Germany must reach mutual understanding on the issue of concrete measures for unification. Therefore, the Socialist Unity Party and the government of the German Democratic Republic must intensify the effort to achieve mutual understanding under the slogan "Germans sit down at one table." It is also necessary to suggest further concrete measures to fill the gap dug between East and West Germany by American imperialists and their West German agents, so that the wishes of all sincere Germans to demand the unification of our country can be realized.

    The Socialist Unity Party of Germany must work harder than before to strengthen the National Front of Democratic Germany in various ways in order to encourage the great patriotic movement for unification and peace.

    Since the working class plays a leading role in the national struggle, the Party must spare no effort to promote the unity of action of the working class throughout Germany.

    The understanding between the people of East and West Germany will at the same time enable the early conclusion of the peace treaty with Germany, which should have been concluded long ago.

    The Party demands the implementation of the resolution of the Budapest Conference of the World Peace Council on resolving international conflicts and disputes through consultation and understanding.

    The Party's Policies, Achievements and Mistakes

    The Party has discovered past mistakes, admitted these mistakes, and conducted open discussions so that everyone can understand the essence of the new policy and facilitate the implementation of the new policy. In doing so, the Party's leadership clearly realized that openly admitting mistakes would cause difficulties. Nevertheless, they decided to adopt the new policy and published the June 9 communiqué for everyone to review. The enemy exploited the fact that the Party confessed its mistakes openly in front of the masses of people to damage the Party's credibility. They spread rumors that the Party's entire policy in the past was wrong. They also intended to make the Party abandon its new policy. However, the Party has not and will never be misled by any slander or forced to deviate from the path it has recognized as historically correct and must be taken.

    The Socialist Unity Party of Germany has achieved great achievements since its establishment. Based on the years of struggle for the unity of the working class, the Party stood in a leading position and established a new democratic country in which the working class had a decisive influence. They have begun to establish a new economic system that does not recognize capitalist rule. They destroyed the power of the Junkers and established a new democratic life in the countryside, and for the first time in the history of the German workers' movement, they laid a solid foundation for the alliance of the working class and the working peasants. Our Party initiated the creation of a new cultural upsurge that would develop German science and art. These truly great achievements are unprecedented in German history. This is the merit of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and no one or anything can take it away. Our Party stood at the forefront of the struggle to safeguard peace. The Party initiated a great patriotic movement demanding the reunification of Germany. Thanks to the Party's suggestion and leadership, the National Front of Democratic Germany was established. Our Party has repeatedly put forward concrete proposals to solve the major national problems of the German people and has consolidated the foundation of the German people's national struggle within the German Democratic Republic. The Party has carried out patriotic education for the German people and raised the banner of national struggle. This policy of our Party in the past was correct. It has proved that the Socialist Unity Party is a truly national party of the German people. The Party is correct: it laid its foundation among the working class and the working peasants. It does not allow any monopoly capital, Junkers, and Fascist organizations to exist. It does not allow war provocations. The Party is correct. It implemented a policy of rebuilding industry and developing productive forces on its own. As a result of this policy, in 1952 it had already reached 157 percent of the pre-war industrial production level. This also proves that the working class of the German Democratic Republic can build an economy that is superior to capitalism. The Party is correct. It restored and developed agricultural production. As a result of this policy, the harvest in 1952 already exceeded the pre-war level, and the productivity of agriculture and animal husbandry exceeded the level of West Germany. In this way, it was proved in the German Democratic Republic that the working class can also develop agriculture, which cannot be achieved under capitalism. At the same time, it is also correct: our Party pointed out the road to socialism, and the German Democratic Republic has already begun to lay the foundation for socialism. The Party's general policy was correct in the past and will be correct in the future.

    In addition to the correct general policy, the Party has also made a series of mistakes in the recent period. These errors are as follows: The Party adopted the correct policy of building the foundations of socialism in the German Democratic Republic, but adopted the wrong methods: it acted too hastily and did not properly consider the current domestic and international preconditions. This resulted in too rapid a pace of economic construction, especially in heavy industry; at the same time, it mistakenly wanted to remove and eliminate the domestic middle and small bourgeoisie and rich peasants. This has harmed the material supply to residents and to some extent disrupted the normal relationship between the Party and the working masses. It used administrative measures to replace the widespread and patient work of enlightening the masses.

    It was correct for the Party organizations in the German Democratic Republic to support the movement initiated by working peasants to establish agricultural production cooperatives. However, in some areas, Party organizations tolerated actions that violated the strict voluntary principle of establishing such agricultural production cooperatives, and demanded an increase in quantity, without giving the necessary attention to strengthening the work of existing cooperatives organizationally and economically, although this work was the Party's primary task in establishing agricultural production cooperatives.

    In addition, many local Party organizations neglected to work among individual farmers, who are the main component of agricultural producers.

    It was wrong for the government's decision to set the tax quotas for large farms often higher than their economic capacity could afford.

    The German Democratic Republic is building a new life in a divided country. This created the particularities and difficulties of reconstruction. The monopoly capital that rules West Germany today is engaged in activities that are deliberately sabotaging the German Democratic Republic. It is supported by American imperialists and can fully organize this sabotage in the center of the German Democratic Republic—West Berlin. Because of the division of Germany, the old economic whole in the country has been destroyed, which of course has an adverse impact on the economic situation of the German Democratic Republic. However, this economic setback can be overcome with the help of the Soviet Union and the world democratic market. The fact that Germany is divided is a great misfortune for the German people and a threat to European peace, which makes the struggle for the reunification of Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis the main task of the Party. Therefore, whatever work the German Democratic Republic does, it must ensure that the work is completed in a way that is conducive to the reunification of Germany and can be understood by the workers in West Germany. It must be pointed out that a large part of the people in West Germany are under the influence of strong reactionary forces because they are constantly influenced by bourgeois newspapers and radio stations. They are prevented from actively improving their understanding of democracy. Therefore, in the German Democratic Republic, the Party's policy must be simple, clear, easy to understand, and have clear goals so that ordinary people can understand it. This kind of policy is the Party's new policy.

    德国统一社会党中央委员会第十五次全体会议的决议
    一九五三年七月二十四日到七月二十六日举行的德国统一社会党中央委员会第十五次全体会议的决议：
    德国统一社会党鉴于其所负加速建立德国统一、保卫欧洲和平及德意志民主共和国人民福利的重大责任，于一九五三年六月九日由政治局通过决议，并由中央委员会自六月二十一日起建议改变德意志民主共和国的政治方针。政府已通过这一建议，从六月十一日起部长会议已根据新方针陆续订出法令。采取这一新方针的理由是希望使德意志民主共和国的经济和政治条件在近期内得到真正的改善，并在这一基础上相当地提高工人阶级和全体劳动人民的生活水准。我们将增加食品工业、民用工业和轻工业的生产，而减少重工业生产，发挥私营工商业的积极性，增进农业生产，这样将可改善人民的物质生活条件。全体公众的生活将更进一步民主化，东西德人民之间的交往将更加便利。采取这些措施，同时也都是为了一个伟大的民族目标：加强和平的力量，促进德国的统一。
    这一方针实行到现在已经产生了相当大的成果：
    工人的工资已经增加了，已经取消了用行政命令提高的生产定额，一级到四级工人的工资也已经增加，车船票价已再次减低，最近实行的社会保险救济金的付款限制已经取消，养老金已经增加，已经实行了许多补救措施来克服工厂中的各种缺点；政府决定拨出款项和物资来大大地扩大房屋建筑计划。
    农民所交公粮的数额已经减低，并已得到贷款，这就为发展农业创造了条件；曾经离开他们的农庄和事业的小农、富农、私营小工商业者的财产已经发还；以前离开了共和国的人已得到关于帮助使他们回来的保证和关于他们的财产将要归还给他们的保证；已经采取了发展知识分子创造性活动的措施。
    区际护照的发给已经放宽了，私商、手工业者和小商人所受到的许多限制已经取消了，贷款促进了他们的经营积极性。
    现在已经采取措施来增加对全体人民的供应物资、再度发给一部分已取消配给的人以配给证，实行减低物价，供应情况已有了切实改进。
    由于政府采取种种措施，增加收入较低的一部分人的工资、增加养老金、减低一些食品与工业品的零售价格、调整对手工业者与私人企业的税收等，德意志民主共和国人民的购买力在今年将增加二十亿马克。
    国家采取谨慎的措施以消除国家与教堂之间的紧张局面。
    民主法治已加强，一些以微小罪名被判处徒刑的人都已予以释放。
    这些措施是党与政府实行新政策的第一步，这种政策将成为党的长远的政治方针，它的目的是要加强争取和平、统一与繁荣的斗争。
    六月十七日的法西斯挑衅事件
    政府宣布实行新方针使得战争贩子和德国统一的敌人暴怒和惊慌不止，他们认识到这种新方针会大大地妨碍他们实行罪恶的战争计划与波恩战争条约，因此便决定实行他们经过长久准备的“X日”计划，以便破坏新政策。因此，法西斯分子决定在六月十七日和十八日这两天进行暴动，是由国际局势所决定的。
    和平、民主与社会主义阵营的不断巩固，相当时期以来已经是很明显的了。它的力量正在世界各地增长着。苏联一贯的和平政策的影响也越来越大了。这特别明显地表现在下述几方面：由于苏联的主动，国际紧张局势趋于和缓，争取大国之间谅解的运动日益增长，朝鲜停战谈判取得了进展，世界和平理事会在布达佩斯举行了令人鼓舞的会议后，世界和平运动大为发展，资本主义阵营内部对美国支配的反抗日益增长。
    国际紧张局势的缓和使千百万人民得出了这样的结论：一切悬而未决的国际问题能够用协商的办法获得和平解决。
    但是，这种发展情况与美国军火垄断资本家的利益和意图是相抵触的。因此，美国的反动集团千方百计阻挠紧张局势的缓和，使事态复杂化，使目前的局势紧张化，正是因为这样，他们才几乎在同一天在世界两个不同的部分对世界和平发动了两次进攻。
    战俘遣返问题的协议刚在板门店签订不久，在美国的傀儡李承晚的命令之下，大批朝鲜人民军的战士在六月十七日晚上就被违反着协议了的遣返条款“释放”了。他们是美军司令部管理下的马山、釜山和其他战俘营内的俘虏，原来应该交给中立国代表组成的委员会保护的。这种挑衅行动的目的在于破坏朝鲜停战协定的缔结。
    几乎同时，从美国军官那里得到武器、汽油瓶和必要的训令的法西斯挑衅分子企图在柏林民主区煽动法西斯暴动。同时在德意志民主共和国其他若干城市内，隐蔽了一些时候的有组织的特务公开出来活动，组织法西斯骚乱。他们从美国的里亚斯电台接受行动训令。帝国主义代理人贝利亚被揭发的事件暴露了这个大规模挑衅行动的国际联系。德国统一社会党中央委员会感谢苏联共产党中央委员会及时地揭露了叛徒贝利亚。德国统一社会党表示它对苏联共产党中央委员会的不可动摇的信心，并表示它将与列宁和斯大林的党永远不渝地团结在一起。
    作为美帝国主义的助手的西德垄断资本家和容克地主在准备六月十七日的法西斯暴乱中，扮演了重要角色。自从工人在德意志民主共和国建立了政权，垄断资本家和容克地主的财产被没收以来，这些在西德掌握政权的家伙一直在进行拚命的斗争，企图在德意志民主共和国恢复资本主义的统治。为了破坏人民的政权，破坏德意志民主共和国的和平建设，抢夺工人的工厂和农民的土地，他们什么罪行都干得出来。阿登纳和凯撒之流以及他们的政治工具公开地谈论着这样一天。这些反动家伙特别憎恨建设人民民主政权的领导力量——德国统一社会党。
    六月十七日的挑衅事件反映了西德垄断资本家和容克地主的企图。法西斯挑衅分子在这天满怀敌意地号召人民推翻德意志民主共和国政府，恢复大资本家和容克地主的政权。
    法西斯分子要在六月十七日制造暴动的企图已经失败。德意志民主共和国大多数人民，特别是工人阶级，不但没有支持挑衅分子，而且强烈地反对他们。暴动的阴谋分子所策划和宣布的总罢工，由于绝大多数的工人不参加而宣告流产。共和国的工人只有百分之五参加了罢工。共和国许多的重要的工厂，例如温特维伦勃恩的马克思铸造厂、劳克哈马炼焦厂、波伦炼钢厂、“威廉·皮克”人造丝厂、柏伦的“奥托·格罗提渥”联合工厂、柏林的西古拉工厂、柏林的克林根堡电力厂、普劳恩的普来麦工厂以及许多其他的工厂的工人，都以加强劳动纪律和提高产量来表示他们对挑衅分子的反击。绝大多数的劳动知识分子也坚决地支持政府。挑衅分子在农民群众中也遭到了同样的反对。在大部分的城镇和工厂中，统一社会党的组织领导着工人坚决地反对了挑衅分子，而扑灭了阴谋中的暴动。大多数的人民对挑衅分子的反对是击败六月十七日的法西斯暴动分子的主要原因。
    共和国的国家机关和苏联的占领军队，特别是后者，在镇压法西斯战争挑衅事件中，起了决定性的作用。六月十七日的暴动失败了。这个失败证明了：德意志民主共和国的民主制度是屹立不可动摇的，因为它得到大多数工人的拥护。
    但是，党必须从六月十七日的事件中吸取教训，并且必须赶快克服在那一天暴露出来的党的工作中的缺点。
    六月十七日的事件说明了，德意志民主共和国境内存在着美国所组织和支持的法西斯地下活动。在这一天，成群的人民的敌人从隐蔽的地方跑出来，在一些城镇中，如马格德堡、哈雷、哥利兹和其他城镇，制造骚乱。非法的法西斯组织和他们的中央机关以及他们与西柏林特务机关经常的联系制度都暴露了。
    以前的纳粹分子起着主要的作用。例如，在布那工厂的G—三十二部就有这种情况，一个法西斯中心在那里按照美国里亚斯电台所发出的指示制造了骚乱。在伦那工厂，一个以前的党卫军分子领导了挑衅事件。在这些大化学工厂里，挑衅分子的首脑都是些法本企业的代理人。
    此外，在若干城市，如马格德堡、来比锡和其他的城市中，还存在着过去的社会民主党党员的非法组织，这些人仍然信仰敌视工人的社会民主主义，因此，他们就很容易地变成了在工人中散布法西斯口号和组织罢工的臭名昭著的“东方局”（西德专门领导对民主德国进行间谍破坏活动的机构——译者）代理人的俘虏了。正直的、从前是社会民主党党员的工人没有了解到，他们这样做是违反他们本阶级的利益和违背德国工人运动原来的理想的。
    参加罢工的工人在事实上支持了挑衅分子，他们的行动违背了他们本阶级的利益，因为法西斯挑衅的目的是在德意志民主共和国推翻工人阶级的政权而恢复资本主义的剥削制度。因此这是对于工人阶级的一个致命的威胁。
    最近我们曾匆促地采取了许多行政措施来提高生产定额。这些措施不是经过周密考虑的，它们歪曲了厉行节约的政策，结果使部分工人的生活水平降低了，并引起了工人中的不满情绪。异己分子设法钻进了某些行政机构和窃取了某些工会的领导。他们采取了敌视工人的措施来故意制造不满，例如：降低工资、拒绝发给保护劳动安全的工作服、破坏劳动保护的规定、漠视工人的社会需要，等等。
    六月十七日的事件引起了敌对的反民主势力在思想的、政治的和经济的领域中的抬头。他们在不同的形式下提出了各种以削弱德意志民主共和国的民主制度并逐渐消灭它为目的的要求。党的任务就在于坚决地反对这种敌对力量的复活和揭发他们敌视人民的本质。
    在挑衅失败以后，敌人企图阻止民主的国家机关
    一网打尽他们的组织。
    前司法部长马克斯·费希纳已被证实犯有反国家的罪行。他利用他的地位保护法西斯挑拨分子，使他们不致受到他们所应得的严厉的惩罚。在他的指示之下，许多敌对行动的积极组织者被释放了。他指示司法机关无例外地释放所有的美国特务和挑衅事件的首脑。这是对敌人——美国与西德的特务组织以及法西斯分子——的直接的和有意的帮助。
    作为司法部长，他也应对无数不公正的和严厉的对共和国工人的判决负责。
    中央委员会决定把费希纳作为党和国家的敌人开除出统一社会党中央委员会和开除出党。
    德国人民、党和政府的敌人发动挑衅以破坏新方针实施的企图失败了。
    德国统一社会党和它在德意志民主共和国政府中的代表今后将更加努力地执行根据部长会议六月九日的决议而采取的新政策。党中央委员会和所有的党组织当前最迫切的任务就是消除所有的缺点。
    新方针与党在经济生活和国家中的任务
    新方针的主要内容是根本改善德意志民主共和国的经济与政治情况，并且在这个基础上相当地提高共和国工人阶级与全体劳动人民的生活水平。
    只有全面地增加德意志民主共和国的工业与农业生产，依靠伟大的社会主义苏联与各人民民主国家所给予的兄弟般的帮助和发展德国内部的与国际的贸易，才有可能完成上述任务。
    完成这个主要任务将使国际和平、民主与社会主义阵营的力量更加加强，并将成为对于德国重新统一的一个具体的贡献。
    首先必须保证大量地增加对工人的食品与工业品的供应。为了达到这一目的，必须这样地来发展贸易，使得更多的质量最好的群众消费品可以卖出。党过去关于削减消费品价格的方针将继续执行。将要进行准备以便完全取消配给制度。要这样地来改变经济生活，使得再没有失业产生。
    将要采取下列措施以便完成新方针的这些重要任务：根据限制重工业投资以增加消费品生产的方针修改五年计划和一九五三年经济计划。
    重工业生产将只增加约百分之五点五到百分之六，原计划规定增加百分之十三。轻工业生产将增加将近百分之九，原计划规定只增加百分之七点一。
    在一九五四年和一九五五年，工业总产量平均每年将增加百分之七。生产资料的生产每年将增加约百分之五，消费品的生产每年将增加约百分之十。
    手工业生产每年将增加百分之十。私人工业的生产也要比一九五三年增加。
    一九五四年和一九五五年对钢工业、采矿工业、机器制造业、化学工业和建筑材料工业的投资，将比五年计划中所规定的数字相当地减少。
    用于扩充动力、煤、运输与农业的生产设备的投资将不减少。轻工业、食品与粮食工业的生产设备将要扩充。
    将要扩展建筑的工作。
    在一九五四年和一九五五年，每公顷土地的谷物收获量将比五年计划中所规定的数字提高。
    在饲养牲畜方面，必须尽可能使牲畜头数达到五年计划中所规定的数字。养猪将超过五年计划中所规定的数字。在缩短喂肥时期和增加猪的宰重方面将给予特别的注意。
    机器拖拉机站将用更多的拖拉机和农业机器装备起来。
    零售贸易量将比五年计划所规定的数字增加，以适应人民购买力的提高。这将使私人商业的货物销售量也相当地增加。
    根据德国统一社会党中央委员会的决议，其次应该完成的任务是：在今年下半年中，使货物销售量比上半年增加约百分之三十。其中食物和粮食的销售量至少要增加百分之二十五，工业品的销售量要增加将近百分之四十。组织为全部完成经济计划而进行的斗争，生产愈高，群众的生活水平也愈高。为了达到这一点，特别重要的是：保证生产的组织工作和技术程序的顺利进行，保证劳动过程的不断顺利进行。为了供给市场以更多更好的货物，必须保证不断地供给工厂以原料，必须不断地提高生产率和改进执行劳动纪律的情况。做到这一点的最重要的方法是在国营经济各部门中展开广泛的竞赛运动。必须继续展开实行经济核算制和严格的节约制度的斗争以减低物价。有步骤地减少各类杂项开支将使国营工厂的利润增加。在农业中，当前最重要的工作是使收割工作不受损失地完成，以提高人民的生活水平。首先必须动员农民群众使收割工作不受损失地完成，并与国家机关、机器拖拉机站、国家统一收购组织和农民互助会密切合作，改进收割与缴售的组织工作。必须通过轮班工作和改进组织工作的办法使机器拖拉机站的机器得到充分的利用。在农村中，收割、打禾与销售合作组织的工作必须改进，同时应发挥劳动人民的创造积极性。必须通过群众组织与民主德国全国阵线从城市中动员大批人来帮助收割。国营工厂工人与行政机构的工作人员应与农业生产合作社订立合同并执行这些合同。国家联合收购组织的收购部门必须设法保证农产品收购工作的顺利进行。在执行新方针时，农业方面的一个工作是鼓舞与支持国家已经给予了他们相当帮助的个体农民。首先应给予小农和中农以这种帮助，不过富农也可以得到贷款和国家的其他帮助以发展他们的庄园。必须特别注意牲畜的饲养。必须按照牲畜饲养的计划来增辟牧草地区。国家将继续帮助农业生产合作社，对于在经济上巩固农业生产合作社将给予特别的注意。自愿原则将严格地加以遵守。机器拖拉机站将更好地装备起来，特别是用可以保证使那些费时与费力操作更进一步机械化的机器（播种机、施肥机、耕耘机等等）装备起来，以满足个体农民与农业生产合作社的要求。特别重要的是要按期给予机器拖拉机站、农业生产合作社以及个体农民以各种（农业）机器零件。
    为了实现新方针，在贸易方面必须完成重要的任务。
    国家与合作社贸易将要进一步发展。将要在广泛的基础上使私人商业的积极性得以发挥。
    贸易组织将为提高货物的质量、增加货物的种类，为提高销售工作的质量和数量，为合理地分配货物和使消费者最快地得到货物而斗争。
    必须确定什么是人民所需要的。在这方面，对于零售商人的积极性将给予一切的鼓励。
    必须永远地根除官僚主义与机械地分配货物。货物的分配将要正确地、详细地加以计划。城市与专区的议会要负起供应人民货物的全部责任。他们必须对供应工人区以及中小的工人城市给予特别的注意。
    为了更进一步鼓励农民市场的发展，特规定所有的农民都有权利参加这些市场。
    国家机关并将更进一步发展地区之间的批发贸易。地区批发贸易负责当地出产的农业产品、工业产品和手工业产品与当地所需要的货物的交换工作。私人的批发贸易将在计划和合同所规定的范围之内进行。
    所有的贸易机关——国营的、合作社与私营的——都必须充分合作，调配当地国营与私营工业以及手工业与农业储存的货物以满足人民的需要。
    为了使商务与供应部能够在所有有关商务与供应的基本问题上给予指示并实行切实的控制，对于那些负责供应人民以食品、纺织品、皮鞋和工业品的国营贸易机关将采取措施以加强对它们的领导。
    商务与供应部将来必须保证统一地管理全部贸易，并保证使它的工作按照计划进行。它应对实行德意志民主共和国政府的贸易政策负责。
    关于财政问题，必须利用财政措施，特别是进一步降低物价和减少税收，来提高人民的生活水平。为了达到这一目的，必须在所有有关财政的问题上实行严格的纪律，加速经济中的货币周转，减少行政开支，在所有的经济与行政部门中实行严格的节约制度。
    进一步地加强民主秩序和严格遵守民主法律是新方针的重要部分。在这方面最重要的任务是使整个的行政机构更接近群众并和他们建立起紧密的联系。完成这个任务的必要条件是消灭单纯用行政管理方法处理问题的方式并展开经常性的反对官僚主义的斗争。批评与自我批评将予鼓励。这将有助于发挥群众协助改进国家机关工作的积极性。人民的每一件控诉都要得到处理。
    同时，国家的权力必须继续加强，以便成为一个能够保护公民权利和法律的强大武器。对民主建设工作的敌人需要提高警惕。
    需要改变和加强人民议院和其他一切人民代表的工作。人民议院的各委员会要定期集会，仔细讨论所有的法律草案和听取正副部长的报告。而且，村、区议会的常务委员会和市政委员会都要比以往起更积极的作用。它们要更多地关心共和国的法律，向人民解释这些法律，并在人民的协助下来执行这些法律。
    议会各机构的全体会议更要积极地履行宪法上所规定的他们的义务。
    要加强代表与选民的联系。代表要比以往起更大的作用，他们要定期召开征求意见会、定期作报告、倾听选民的希望和指示，而且要报告这些希望和指示是否已经成为现实。
    要给予民主联盟新的生命。民主联盟的中央机构以及在乡、区和公共团体中的工作将要加强。民主党派和群众组织要努力增进和加强与民主联盟的合作，以便加强德意志民主共和国的民主秩序和提高人民的生活水平。联盟工作的加强将鼓舞进步力量。对于他们反对反动分子的斗争要给予强有力的支持。这些反动分子隐藏在联盟的某些党派中，自从六月十七日以来，他们积极发表反对共和国的言论。
    民主法律必须严格遵守。任何企图以强制行政措施侵犯为宪法所保护的公民权利的行为必须受到法律的严厉制裁。司法机关、人民警察和国家其他的行政机关的工作必须这样地来改进。他们在工作中，必须采取措施来反对所有破坏我们国家秩序的敌人、法西斯挑衅分子和战争挑拨者，以保护工人的权利。
    在文化方面，新方针要进一步培养民族文化的创造者。特别是要进一步奖励进步的科学和艺术，必须保护科学家和艺术家的自由的创造活动。必须爱护民族传统和德国文化的遗产。必须增进德意志民主共和国与苏联和人民民主国家文艺工作者的友谊。必须按照德国的特殊情况仔细研究和评价苏联科学和艺术的伟大成就。同时，也要促进德意志民主共和国和西德文艺工作者的来往。初级学校、职业学校和高等学校必须对学生进行更好的、适合于需要的教育，并通过开办新的高等学校和扩大现有的高等学校的办法，保证造就水平很高的工业、农业、行政和文化生活方面的专家。在艺术和文学方面，必须继续展开拥护现实主义和反对所有反民族、反民主的颓废表现的斗争，同时，必须仔细和耐心地以党的关于艺术和文学的发展的观点来说服艺术家和作家。在任何情况下，都不准用行政的手段强迫他们接受这种观点。
    在巩固民主法律与制度方面，一个重要的任务是训练国家和经济机构的工作人员，使他们能够执行新的方针。我们的制度只容许这样的工作人员存在，他们有专门知识，并且精力充沛地、科学地执行政府的决定和指示，而不独断独行。他们一定不能推卸责任。他们一定得严格遵守法律，同时又有一个开阔的心胸，关心人民的需要和疾苦。不听人民的申诉，对他们采取冷淡的、官僚主义的态度，打官腔，漫不经心而且采取应付的态度去处理事情——所有这一切，在执行德意志民主共和国国家机构和经济机构的职务时，都是不能容许的。
    因此，必须训练国家和经济机构的旧人员和教育新人员，使他们认识这一点。这种工作一定不能拖延。
    同时，新方针的目的还在于加强和平力量，促进德国统一。建立德国统一的必要先决条件，是东、西德人民在达成统一的具体措施问题上必须互相谅解。因此，统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府在“德国人坐到一张桌子上来”的口号下，要加紧争取互相了解。还要建议采取下一步的具体措施，以便填平美帝国主义者和他们的西德代理人在东、西德之间挖成的鸿沟，使一切真诚的德国人要求我国统一的愿望得以实现。
    德国统一社会党要比以前更加努力，用各种方法来加强民主德国全国阵线，以便鼓舞争取统一与和平的伟大爱国运动。
    工人阶级既然是在全国的斗争中起领导作用的，因此，党要不遗余力地在全德促进工人阶级行动的一致。
    东、西德人民之间的谅解，同时会使早就该缔结的对德和约能够早日缔结。
    党要求实现世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议关于通过协商和谅解解决国际冲突和争端的决议。
    党的政策、成就和错误
    党已经发现了过去的错误，承认了这些错误，并且进行了公开的讨论，好让每一个人都明白新方针的实质，而便于新方针的实施。在这样做的时候，党的领导机构清楚地意识到：公开承认错误会引起困难。虽然如此，他们还是决定采取新方针，并且发表了六月九日的公报，让所有的人审查。在人民群众面前坦白承认错误这件事被敌人利用来破坏党的信誉，他们造谣说：过去党的整个政策都是错误的。他们还打算使党离开它的新方针。但是党没有而且也绝不会因任何毁谤而走入歧途，或者被迫离开它已经认识到是具有历史的正确性的、必须走的道路。
    德国统一社会党自从成立以来，已经获得了重大的成就。党以争取工人阶级统一的多年斗争为基础，站在领导地位上，建立了一个新的民主国家，在这个国家里，工人阶级有决定的影响。他们已经开始建立了一个新的经济制度，这个经济制度不承认资本家的统治。他们摧毁了容克地主的权力而在乡村里建立新的民主生活，并且在德国工人运动史上头一次奠下了工人阶级和劳动农民联盟的坚固基础。我们的党倡议造成新的文化高潮，这个高潮会使德国的科学和艺术发达。这些真正伟大的成就在德国历史上是空前的，这是德国统一社会党的功绩，任何人或者任何事物都不能把它夺去。我们的党站在维护和平的斗争前列。党倡议进行要求重新统一德国的伟大爱国主义运动。由于党的建议和领导，民主德国全国阵线建立起来了。我们的党反复提出解决德国人民重大的民族问题的具体建议，并且已经在德意志民主共和国内巩固了德国人的民族斗争的基础。党对德国人民进行了爱国主义教育，并且打起了民族斗争的大旗。过去我们党的这个政策是正确的。它已经证明，统一社会党是德国人民的真正民族政党。党是正确的：它在工人阶级和劳动农民中奠定了自己的基础，它不容许任何垄断资本、容克地主和法西斯组织存在，它不容许战争挑衅。党是正确的，它执行了重建工业和依靠自己的力量发展生产力的政策。由于这个政策，一九五二年就已经达到战前工业生产水平的百分之一百五十七。这也就证明了，德意志民主共和国的工人阶级能够建设一种比资本主义优越的经济。党是正确的，它恢复并且发展了农业生产。由于这种政策，一九五二年的收获量就已经超过战前，农业和畜牧业的生产率并且超出了西德的水平。这样，在德意志民主共和国就证明了，工人阶级也能发展农业，而在资本主义下是不能获得这样的发展的。同时，这也是正确的：我们的党指出了走向社会主义的道路，而德意志民主共和国也已经开始为社会主义奠立基础。党的总方针过去和将来都是正确的。
    除了正确的总方针以外，党在最近一个时期也犯了一系列错误。这些错误如下：党采取了在德意志民主共和国建设社会主义基础的正确方针，却采取了错误的方法：它操之过急而没有适当地考虑到目前国内外的先决条件。这就造成经济建设步调过急，特别是在重工业方面；同时错误地想除去和消灭国内的中、小资产阶级和富农。这就损害了对居民的物质供应，并且在某种程度上还扰乱了党和劳动群众的正常关系。它用行政措施去代替那种启发群众的广泛而耐心的工作。
    党组织在德意志民主共和国支持劳动农民所倡议的成立农业生产合作社的运动，这是正确的。但是在某些地区，党组织容忍了违反成立这种农业生产合作社的严格自愿原则的行动，并且强求量的增加，而对于从组织上和经济上加强现有合作社的工作没有给予必要的注意，虽然这种工作是党在建立农业生产合作社方面的首要任务。
    此外，党的许多地方组织忽略了在个体农民中进行工作，而个体农民却是农业生产者的主要分子。
    政府的决定把大农庄的缴纳定额订得往往高于它们经济能力所能胜任的，这是错误的。
    德意志民主共和国是在国家分裂的情况下建设新生活的。这就造成了重建的特殊性和困难。今天统治着西德的垄断资本从事着存心破坏德意志民主共和国的活动。它获得美帝国主义者的支持，并且完全可以在德意志民主共和国的中心——西柏林——组织这种破坏活动。由于德国的分裂，国内旧日的经济整体已经被摧毁，这当然对德意志民主共和国的经济情况有不利影响。但是，这种经济上的挫折在苏联及世界民主市场的帮助之下，是能够克服的。德国分裂的事实是德国人民的大不幸，也是欧洲和平的威胁，这就使得争取德国在民主和平的基础上重新统一的斗争成为党的主要任务。因此，德意志民主共和国无论做什么工作，都必须使完成工作的方式能有利于德国的重新统一，能为西德的工人所了解。必须指出：西德很大一部分人民因为经常受到资产阶级报纸和广播电台的影响，所以他们是在强有力的反动力量影响之下的，他们受到阻挠，不能积极地提高对民主的认识。因此，在德意志民主共和国中，党的政策一定要简单、明了、平易近人、目标明确，好让普通人民能够了解。这样的政策就是党的新方针。
