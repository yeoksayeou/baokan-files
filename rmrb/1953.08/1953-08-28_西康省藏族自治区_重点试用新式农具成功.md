The successful pilot use of new farm tools in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has been welcomed by the broad masses of Tibetan farmers. This year, agricultural production technology guidance stations in twelve counties within the autonomous region have focused on piloting new farm tools. Daofu, Dege, Kangding and other counties have successively opened training classes on new-style walking plows, with a total of more than 200 people learning how to use and repair them. Qingmei, a Tibetan female youth league member from Daofu County, learned how to operate the new-style walking plow in five days. During the pilot use in various places, the new-style walking plow demonstrated advantages such as deep plowing, straight furrows, and labor-saving for both humans and animals, with an efficiency increase of 30% compared to the old-style Tibetan plow. Tibetan farmers greatly appreciate this type of farm tool. This year, Gexi, Wari, Mazhi and other villages in Daofu County used the new-style walking plow to cultivate more than 50 mu of land, and the crops are growing well. Based on the results of the pilot use, the Autonomous Region People's Government has transported 1,128 new-style walking plows, 400 corn threshers, and 80 sprayers from various places, and plans to promote them more widely next year.

    西康省藏族自治区
    重点试用新式农具成功
    西康省藏族自治区重点试用新式农具成功，得到广大藏族农民的欢迎。今年，自治区内十二个县的农业生产技术指导站都重点地试用了新式农具，道孚、德格、康定等县都先后开办了新式步犁训练班，总计有二百多人学会了使用和修理新式步犁。道孚县藏族女青年团员青梅，五天内就学会了新式步犁的操作方法。新式步犁在各地试用中，显示了翻土深、耕得直、人畜省力等优点，效率较旧式藏犁提高十分之三。藏族农民很爱这种农具。道孚县的格西、瓦日、麻之等村，今年使用新式步犁耕了五十多亩地，庄稼生长良好。根据试用结果，自治区人民政府已从各地运来新式步犁一千一百二十八部，玉米脱粒机四百部，喷雾器八十部，拟在明年更普遍地推广。    （新华社）
