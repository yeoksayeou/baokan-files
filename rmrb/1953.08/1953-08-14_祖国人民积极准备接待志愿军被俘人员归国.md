In addition, five medical branches have been set up, each with various departments, operating rooms, treatment rooms, pharmacies, nutrition rooms, and bathrooms. Now, the staff of these hospitals have decorated the indoor and outdoor environments, and soft mattresses and snow-white sheets have been laid on each bed. The medical teams responsible for mobile treatment are also fully prepared for all treatment work, so that the wounded and sick prisoners of war who have suffered so much in the hands of the enemy can receive the best care and medical treatment as soon as they return home.

    现在各地人民正在积极筹组慰问团、电影放映队，准备慰问即将归国的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。大批的大米、面粉、肉类及各种食物和用品也在源源运来。
