The People's Life in the Alxa League Autonomous Region of Ningxia
The Alxa League Autonomous Region is located in central Ningxia Province. It is inhabited by more than 38,000 industrious and courageous Mongolian people, as well as some Han, Hui, Tibetan, and Manchu people. Since the establishment of the autonomous region, the people's lives have greatly improved. Left picture: Camel caravans frequently transport salt and local products from the Jilantai Salt Lake in the southern part of the Alxa League to Dengkou and Zhongwei in Ningxia Province, and bring back large quantities of necessities to supply the needs of the people in the autonomous region. Right picture: After a day's journey, it's time to camp. Unload the goods, pitch the tents, and prepare to rest. (The photos in this issue of the pictorial are provided by the People's Pictorial, photographed by Peng Huashi)
    Hunting wolves is a sideline production for the Mongolian people, which not only protects the sheep but also increases income. This is a picture of Dao Diba (right), a model wolf hunter, taking wolf skins to the autonomous region government to exchange for wolf traps.
    Archery, horse riding, and wrestling are all favorite sports of the Mongolian people.
    Otter fur hats transported from Beijing to the Alxa League cooperative are very popular among the Mongolian people.
    At the campsite, people rest and chat happily.
    Everything is settled, and the women are busy drawing water for the camels to drink and preparing food.
    Cultural centers and radio stations have also been established. People can not only listen to news from all over the country here, but also improve their enthusiasm for learning.
    Mongolian doctor Lin Rongchun explains physiology and hygiene to the women's training class held by the Alxa League Democratic Women's Federation. After studying here, many Mongolian women return to various places to work in maternal and child health.
    Mongolian woman Naren Qimuge holds her child and happily goes to the Alxa League Health Center for a physical examination.
    The education of the people in the Alxa League Autonomous Region has developed rapidly. Now the number of primary school students in Bayanhot has increased to 1,070, and three Mongolian primary schools and three Mongolian-Han primary schools have been established in each "Bag" (equivalent to township). This is a picture of a class at the Alxa League Central Mongolian Primary School.

    宁夏阿拉善旗自治区的人民生活
    阿拉善旗自治区是在宁夏省中部，这里住着三万八千多勤劳勇敢的蒙族人民和一部分汉族、回族、藏族、满族人民。自治区成立后，人民生活已有了很大的改善。左图：骆驼队经常把阿拉善旗南部吉兰泰盐池的盐和土特产运送到宁夏省磴口、中卫等地去，又从这些地方运回大批生活必需品，供给自治区人民的需用。右图：走了一天，宿营的时候到了，卸下货物搭起帐篷，准备休息。（本期画刊照片为人民画报供稿，彭华士摄）
    打狼是蒙族人民的副业生产，不但可以保护羊群，还能增加收入。这是打狼模范道地巴（右）把狼皮拿到自治区政府去换打狼用的夹挠子时的情形。
    射箭、骑马和摔跤都是蒙族人民喜爱的体育活动。
    从北京运到阿拉善旗合作社的水獭皮帽，很受蒙族人民的欢迎。
    在宿营地上，人们一边休息一边愉快地谈话。
    一切都安顿好了，妇女们忙着汲水给骆驼喝，并且准备食物。
    文化馆和收音站也成立起来了，人们不但从这里可以收听到全国各地的新闻，并且还因此提高了他们的学习热情。
    蒙族医生林荣春在阿拉善旗民主妇女联合会举办的妇女训练班上给大家讲解生理卫生。许多蒙族妇女在这里学习以后，便回到各地去担任妇婴卫生工作。
    蒙族妇女娜仁其木格抱着自己的小孩，高兴地到阿拉善旗卫生院检查身体。
    阿拉善旗自治区人民的教育事业有了迅速的发展。现在巴晋浩特的小学生已增加到一千零七十人，在各个“巴格”（相当于乡）设立了三所蒙民小学和三所蒙汉小学。这是阿拉善旗中心蒙民小学上课时的情形。
