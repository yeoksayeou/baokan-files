Xinhua News Agency, London, August 13th: The war-mongering sixteen-nation declaration, manipulated and manufactured by the United States, has aroused increasing dissatisfaction and opposition in Britain.
　　
According to a United Press report on the 12th, the "storm" that had been brewing since the publication of the so-called sixteen-nation declaration and Dulles' visit to Korea "has now begun to break." Various parties are deeply concerned about Britain's participation in signing this declaration and undertaking the obligation to expand the war, and have lodged accusations against the Churchill government. United Press said: The "clamor of protest against the sixteen-nation declaration is rising higher and higher" in Britain.
　　
Former British Labour government ministers Patrick Gordon Walker and Douglas Jay published an "angry" open letter in the London "Times" on the 12th, questioning the British government's participation in signing the sixteen-nation declaration, and demanding that the British government clarify its attitude on whether it is prepared to fight China.
　　
At the same time, British newspapers continue to publish commentaries criticizing the so-called sixteen-nation declaration. The "Times" commented on the 12th, expressing particular concern about the declaration's threat to expand the scope of the war in the event of a "renewed armed attack." The commentary said: "This unpleasant part of the declaration is dangerous, because many influential American opinions may mistakenly believe that the other fifteen countries besides the United States—the most important of which is Britain—will immediately participate in a war against mainland China if the armistice breaks down." The newspaper emphasized: This approach "is dangerous and wrong."
　　
The newspaper warned: "If the British government is short-sighted, then it is putting itself on a slippery slope, making it difficult to maintain its proper position, which should be based on the established course of British Far Eastern policy."
　　
The newspaper reflected the dissatisfaction of the British Parliament with the government, saying: "Before the parliamentary recess, the government consistently concealed this declaration in the foreign affairs debate, and did not even let the leaders of the opposition party know about it in private until later. Labour members of Parliament felt insulted and expressed doubts about this."
　　
The Conservative Party's "Yorkshire Post" commented on the same day: "The only honest statement about the situation is: the United States and South Korea have already decided on policy regardless of the United Nations."
　　
The newspaper emphasized: "He (Syngman Rhee) must not be given the opportunity to undermine overall peace to achieve his own goals."

    侵朝十六国宣言在英国引起广泛的反对
    【新华社十三日讯】伦敦消息：由美国操纵制造的充满战争气息的十六国宣言，已在英国引起日益增长的不满和反对。
    据合众社十二日消息，自从发表所谓十六国宣言和杜勒斯访问朝鲜以来一直在酝酿的“风暴”，“现在已开始爆发”。各方对于英国竟然参加签署这一宣言而承担扩大战争的义务一节深感忧虑，并纷纷对邱吉尔政府提出责难。合众社说：英国国内“抗议十六国宣言的声浪越来越高涨了”。
    前英国工党政府大臣帕特里克·戈登—华尔克和道格拉斯·贾埃十二日在伦敦“泰晤士报”上发表
    一封“怒气冲冲”的公开信，就英国政府参加签署十六国宣言一事提出质问，他们要求英政府在是否准备对中国作战的问题上表明态度。
    同时，英国报纸继续发表评论，抨击所谓十六国宣言。“泰晤士报”在十二日的评论中，对于宣言中威胁要在“武装攻击复起”时扩大战争范围一点特别表示不安。评论说：“宣言中令人不快的这一部分是很危险的，因为许多有势力的美国舆论可能误认为美国以外的其他十五个国家——其中英国最重要——会马上参加对中国大陆发动的战争，如果停战破裂的话。”该报强调：这种做法“是危险而且错误的”。
    该报警告说：“如果英国政府目光短浅，那末就等于把自己置于一个滑坡上，很难维持自己适当的立场，而这个立场是应该以英国的远东政策的既定路线为根据的。”
    该报反映英国议会中对政府的不满说：“议会休假前，政府在外交辩论上始终隐瞒着这个宣言，甚至不让反对党的领袖们私下里知道这件事，直到后来才说出来。议会中的工党议员们对此感到侮辱并且表示疑虑。”
    保守党的“约克郡邮报”在同一天发表评论说：“对局势的唯一老实的说法是：美国与南朝鲜已经不顾联合国而决定了政策。”
    该报强调说：“决不可给他（李承晚）机会来破坏全面和平以实现他自己的目的。”
