    The Work of Unified Assignment of College Graduates Must Be Done Well
    This summer, more than 34,000 college graduates across the country, under the unified assignment of the government, are about to embark on various positions in the construction of the motherland. This is of great significance to both themselves and the national construction cause.
    Our country has entered a new period of construction unprecedented in history, and needs a large number of talents with the spirit of serving the people and advanced scientific and technological knowledge. In the past three years, Chinese colleges and universities have trained more than 74,000 young cadres, who have played a significant role in various work positions of the country and have become a huge force in the national construction cause. However, for the entire national construction cause, there is still a great shortage of various specialized talents. This summer's college graduates should fully recognize the importance of their responsibilities, proceed from the needs of national construction, obey unified assignment, and live up to the ardent expectations of the motherland and the people. Personnel departments and business organs should also carefully assign and use them so that they can play their maximum role.
    This summer's unified assignment of college graduates, according to the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government, will continue to adopt the principle of "centralized use and key allocation," which is completely correct. Only in this way can graduates be centrally allocated to construction departments that are decisive for the national construction cause, and promote the development of the entire national construction cause. The focus of the allocation is on the construction and design aspects of basic construction and the teaching assistant and graduate student aspects of higher industrial schools, and appropriately taking care of the actual needs of the localities. Other aspects should be allocated as little as possible or not allocated, to avoid the problems of scattered forces and failing to attend to all aspects. This is also completely in line with the actual situation of our country.
    In the past three years, due to the serious implementation of the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on the unified assignment of college graduates by the personnel departments and business organs, the assignment of the vast majority of college graduates has been appropriate, and generally in line with the principle of combining learning with application. But at the same time, it should also be admitted that there are still some shortcomings in the unified assignment work in the past: the work of a few graduates has not been assigned properly, and does not conform to the principle of combining learning with application; ideological education for graduates on obeying the unified assignment of the state is still not enough; a few employers have many shortcomings in the use, training and care of graduates in political life. These must be improved.
    The State Council of the Central People's Government has repeatedly made it clear in its instructions on the unified assignment of graduates: "The principle of combining learning with application should be implemented on the basis of adapting to the needs of national construction." The People's Government requires the realization of the principle of combining learning with application in the unified assignment work, in order to enable graduates to play their maximum role in their work; and the graduate students are concerned about the issue of combining learning with application, hoping that they can use what they have learned in their work, also in order to play their maximum role in their work.
    Naturally, the principle of combining learning with application should not be considered in isolation from the needs of the state; but the needs of the state refer to the needs of the overall interests of the state, and the needs of individual departments should be subordinate to the overall needs of the state. Some employers one-sidedly emphasize the "work needs" of their units, and do not assign the work of graduates according to the principle of combining learning with application, and even unnecessarily "change careers" for graduates (regardless of the urgent need for such cadres in other units), which is actually a manifestation of departmentalism. At the same time, some organs are neither familiar with the business needs of their units, nor do they study the specialties of graduates, and blindly assign the work of graduates, so that some graduates cannot use what they have learned in their work. This is a manifestation of bureaucratic style, which must be corrected. We must never ignore that our country is under construction. We are very short of talents. We must do everything possible to avoid the waste of talents.
    On the other hand, it should also be emphasized that the vast majority of Chinese colleges and universities are being transformed and growing on the old foundation. The residual influence of the old education system cannot be completely overcome in the short term. Their department settings and teaching content cannot fully meet the current actual needs of the country. Therefore, the current assignment of graduates' work cannot fully meet the requirements of combining learning with application, and can only make relative requirements based on the specific circumstances of national needs. That is to say, due to the needs of the country, it is still difficult to avoid that some graduates are assigned to do work that is similar in nature to what they have learned, or do other work. College graduates should proceed from the actual situation when considering the issue of combining learning with application, and think about the interests of the entire country and all the people, and should not mechanically and one-sidedly understand the principle of combining learning with application, and isolate and emphasize personal wishes or personal interests.
    College graduates should not only obey the state's assignment and happily embark on their work posts, but also have full ideological preparation to overcome difficulties in their actual work. After they embark on their work posts, they will inevitably encounter some difficulties. But as long as they work hard in a down-to-earth and realistic manner, any difficulties can be overcome. And only in the process of constantly overcoming difficulties in work and study can everyone gradually improve their level in all aspects. Practical training is extremely important for college graduates. Practical work and study can temper his political qualities and business abilities, and constantly develop and supplement the knowledge he has already learned. As long as you are determined to delve into it, even if you are unfamiliar with the work, you can gradually become familiar with it and gradually become an expert in this work. Comrade Stalin said: "The real training of cadres is to be obtained in living work, outside of school, in the struggle against difficulties, and in the process of overcoming difficulties." He also said: "Only those cadres who are not afraid of difficulties, do not evade difficulties, but go forward to meet difficulties in order to overcome and eliminate difficulties are good cadres. Real cadres can only be trained in the struggle against difficulties." (See "Speech at the Graduation Ceremony of the Red Army Academy in the Kremlin"). What a profound instruction this is!
    In order to give play to the enthusiasm of graduates, it is very important for employers to do a good job in reception and consolidation. Employers should adopt a warm welcome and help attitude towards graduates, assign their work in a timely manner, use them reasonably, and promptly and appropriately resolve the practical difficulties and opinions raised by graduates. They should not be indiscriminately regarded as ideological problems without analysis, and ignored. Some units neither pay attention to cultivating them in their work, nor lack political and ideological leadership, but adopt simple and rude methods for graduates who really have ideological problems. This makes some graduates uneasy at work for a long time after arriving at their work posts, causing some completely avoidable problems, and causing losses to the work. This situation must be changed. Especially for those graduates with internships, all departments should make good internship plans and provide them with serious assistance in all aspects.
    The unified assignment of college graduates is a very complex and meticulous planning and organizational work, which requires all relevant departments to act cautiously, work together, and also requires graduate students to actively assist the government in doing this work well, so that this summer's unified assignment of college graduates across the country can be successfully completed.

### 必须作好高等学校毕业生统一分配的工作

    必须作好高等学校毕业生统一分配的工作
    今年暑期全国高等学校毕业生三万四千多人，在政府统一分配之下，就要走上祖国建设的各种岗位。这对于他们自己和国家建设事业来说，都有重大的意义。
    我们的国家，已进到历史上从未有过的新的建设时期，需要大量具有为人民服务精神和先进科学技术知识的各种人材。在过去三年中，我国高等学校已培养出七万四千多名青年干部，他们在国家各种工作岗位上发挥了重大作用，成为国家建设事业中的巨大力量，但就整个国家建设事业来说，依然十分缺乏各项专门人材。今年暑期全国高等学校毕业生应该充分认识自己职责的重大，从国家建设的需要出发，服从统一分配，不负祖国和人民的殷切期望；而人事部门和业务机关，也应该十分慎重地分配、使用他们，使他们能够发挥最大限度的作用。
    今年暑期高等学校毕业生统一分配的工作，根据中央人民政府政务院的指示，仍采取“集中使用，重点配备”的方针，这是完全正确的。因为只有这样，才能把毕业生集中地配备到对国家建设事业具有决定意义的建设部门中去，推动整个国家建设事业的发展。分配的重点是基本建设的施工、设计方面及高等工业学校的助教、研究生方面，并适当照顾地方的实际需要。其他方面则尽可能地少配备或不配备，避免造成力量分散、顾此失彼的毛病。这也是完全符合我们国家的实际情况的。
    在过去三年中，由于人事部门和业务机关认真地执行了中央人民政府政务院关于高等学校毕业生统一分配工作的指示，绝大多数的高等学校毕业生的分配是适当的，一般地是符合于学用一致的原则的。但同时也应该承认，过去在统一分配工作上，还存在着一些缺点：少数毕业生的工作分配得不够恰当，不符合学用一致的原则；对毕业生进行关于服从国家统一分配的思想教育还很不够；少数用人部门对毕业生的使用、培养和在政治生活上的关心有许多缺点。这都是必须加以改进的。
    中央人民政府政务院对毕业生统一分配工作，一再明确指示：要“在适应国家建设需要的基础上贯彻学用一致的原则”。人民政府在统一分配工作中要求实现学用一致的原则，是为了使毕业生在工作中发挥最大限度的作用；而毕业同学们关心学用一致问题，希望自己在工作中能够用其所学，也是为了在工作中发挥最大限度的作用。
    自然，学用一致的原则，不应该脱离国家需要的基础来考虑；但国家的需要是指国家整体利益的需要，个别部门的需要应该服从国家整体的需要。某些用人机关片面地强调本单位的“工作需要”，不按照学用一致的原则来分配毕业生的工作，甚至使毕业生不必要地“改行”（不管其他单位迫切需要这样的干部），这实际上乃是本位主义的作法。同时，某些机关，既不熟悉本单位的业务的需要，也不研究毕业生的专长，盲目地分配毕业生的工作，使某些毕业生在工作中不能用其所学。这是官僚主义作风的一种表现，是必须纠正的。我们决不应该忽视，我们的国家正在建设。我们十分缺乏人材。我们必须尽一切可能来避免人材的浪费。
    另一方面，也应该着重指出，我国的高等学校绝大部分是在旧的基础上改造和成长着的。旧教育制度的残余影响，在短期内还不可能完全被克服。它们的科系设置和教学内容，还不能完全适合目前国家的实际需要。因此，目前分配毕业生的工作，还不能完全达到学用一致的要求，只能根据国家需要的具体情况作相对的要求。这就是说，由于国家的需要，一部分毕业生被分配去做与其所学性质相近的工作，或作别的工作，仍是难以避免的。高等学校毕业生在考虑学用一致的问题时，应当从实际情况出发，为整个国家和全体人民的利益着想，不应该机械地、片面地理解学用一致的原则，孤立地强调个人志愿或个人兴趣。
    高等学校毕业生，不但应该服从国家分配，愉快地走上工作岗位，而且还得有在实际工作中克服困难的充分思想准备。他们走上工作岗位以后，必然会遇到一些困难。但只要脚踏实地、实事求是地努力工作，任何困难都是可以克服的。而且也只有在不断克服工作和学习中的困难的过程中，每个人才能逐步提高自己各方面的水平。实际锻炼对高等学校毕业生来说是极端重要的。实际工作和学习能够锻炼他的政治品质和业务能力，不断发展和补充他已经学得的知识。只要下决心钻进去，即使对比较生疏的工作，也能慢慢熟悉起来，逐步成为这一工作的内行。斯大林同志说：“干部的真正锻炼，是要在活的工作中，在学校以外，在和困难作斗争中，在克服困难的过程中取得的。”他又说：“只有那些不害怕困难，不躲避困难，反而前去迎接困难，以求克服和消灭困难的干部，才是优良的干部。真正的干部，只能在和困难作斗争中锻炼出来。”（见“在克里姆林宫举行的红军学院学生毕业典礼大会上的演说”）。这是多么深刻的指示啊！
    为了发挥毕业生的工作积极性，用人机关作好接待和巩固工作是十分重要的。用人机关对毕业生应该采取热情的欢迎和帮助的态度，及时分配他们的工作，合理地使用他们，对于毕业生所提出的实际困难和意见，应及时地适当加以解决，不能不加分析地笼统认为是思想问题，而置之不顾。有些单位既不注意在工作中培养他们，又缺乏政治思想领导，而对真有思想问题的毕业生则采取简单粗暴的办法。这便使一部分毕业生到达工作岗位后，长期不安心工作，发生一些完全可以避免的问题，使工作遭到损失。这种情况必须切实加以改变。特别对于那些有实习期的毕业生，各部门均应作好实习计划，从各方面对他们进行认真的帮助。
    高等学校毕业生统一分配工作是一个十分复杂、细致的计划工作和组织工作，这要求各有关部门，谨慎从事、同心合力；也要求毕业同学们主动积极地协助政府做好这一工作，使今年暑期全国高等学校毕业生统一分配工作胜利地完成。
