Qingdao State-Owned No. 2 Cotton Mill Preparation Workshop

Helps Workers Solve Difficulties, Reducing Absenteeism

The preparation workshop of the Qingdao No. 2 State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory has reduced its absenteeism rate by having leading cadres care about the daily lives of the workers and helping them solve specific difficulties. The average absenteeism rate from January to May of this year was less than 3 percent.

Women workers account for more than three-quarters of the total number of workers in the preparation workshop, and there are 38 women workers with children. Last year, the absenteeism rate in the workshop was often around 10 percent. Sometimes, in order to supply the needs of the weaving workshop's production, the administration would use methods such as increasing the number of spindles watched and hiring temporary workers to remedy the situation, but the output and quality did not meet standards. The loss caused by hiring temporary workers in the three winding groups alone was equivalent to three workers not coming to work all year round.

At the beginning of this year's planning, the workshop leadership focused on the issue of attendance rate. First, they studied the reasons for absenteeism last year, mainly because the cadres did not go deep into the masses, did not understand the difficulties of the masses well, and did not help solve them. Based on these reasons, they found solutions. On the one hand, they mobilized the masses to do a good job in safety and sanitation, paying attention to cleanliness and personal health; on the other hand, they helped the masses solve specific difficulties. For example, Tian Xiumei's child developed measles, and there was no one at home to take care of the child or cook, so she took two days off in a row. Propagandist Sun Xiuying went to cook for her and found someone to take care of her child. Tian Xiumei said gratefully, "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party will everyone help me like this. I will definitely not take any more leave and will ensure the completion of the task." Zhao Jiting's family has seven people, and he is the only one working. He is also sick, so his family has financial difficulties. After group discussion, the union applied for three relief funds to solve his difficulties. A group of apprentice workers from far away were not settled in their work, so the union mobilized veteran workers to help solve the accommodation problem. The workshop director, Ji Xiumei, vacated one of her small rooms and solved the accommodation problem for sixteen apprentice workers, making them feel at ease in their work.

Because the leading cadres of the workshop helped the masses solve specific difficulties, the workers' enthusiasm for work was very high. At the same time, they also guaranteed the attendance rate by implementing patriotic pacts and frequently conducting mass inspections. Therefore, the attendance rate of this workshop from January to May of this year averaged 97.5 percent, fundamentally eliminating the phenomenon of hiring temporary workers, and many groups have fully completed their production plans.

### 青岛国棉二厂准备车间  帮助工人解决困难缺勤率降低

    青岛国棉二厂准备车间
    帮助工人解决困难缺勤率降低
    国营青岛第二棉织厂准备车间，因为领导干部关心工人群众的日常生活，并帮助解决具体困难，降低了缺勤率，今年一月份至五月份缺勤率平均不到百分之三。
    准备车间女工占总人数四分之三以上，其中有小孩的女工三十八人。去年车间的缺勤率经常在百分之十左右，有时因供应不上织布车间生产的需要，行政上就采用增加看锭和雇临时工的办法来补救，结果产量质量都达不到标准。仅络经三个组雇临时工所造成的损失，就等于三个工人长年没有到工。
    今年一开始订计划，车间领导上就抓紧了出勤率的问题。首先研究了去年缺勤的原因，主要是因为干部不深入群众，没有很好了解群众的困难和帮助解决。根据这些原因，找出了解决的办法，一方面发动群众做好安全卫生工作，注意清洁和个人身体的健康；一方面帮助群众解决具体困难。例如田秀美的小孩生痧子，家里没有人看孩子、做饭，她一连歇了两个工。宣传员孙秀英知道后就去替她做饭，找人给她看孩子。田秀美感激地说：“只有在共产党领导下，大家才会这样帮助我，我一定不再歇工，保证完成任务。”赵继庭家有七口人，只他一人做工，本人还有病，因此家里生活困难。经过小组讨论，向工会申请了三次救济金，解决了他的困难。有一批路远的养成工，工作不安心，工会就发动老工人帮助解决住宿问题。车间主任纪秀美把自己的一间小房腾出来，解决了十六个养成工的住宿问题，使她们工作安心了。
    因为车间的领导干部，帮助群众解决了具体困难问题，所以工人们的劳动热情都很高。同时又通过执行爱国公约来保证出勤率，并经常有群众性的检查。所以这个车间今年一月份至五月份的出勤率平均达到了百分之九十七点五，根本上消灭了雇临时工的现象，并且有不少小组都全面完成了生产计划。        （于学尧）
