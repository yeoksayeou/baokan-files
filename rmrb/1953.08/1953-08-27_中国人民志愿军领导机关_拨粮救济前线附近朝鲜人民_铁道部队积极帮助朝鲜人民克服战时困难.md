Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 26th—The leading organ of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army recently decided to allocate 1 million jin of grain to relieve the Korean people living near the front lines.

During the war, the lives and property of the Korean people near the war zone suffered casualties and serious damage from enemy artillery and aircraft. However, with the relief and assistance of the Korean government and the Korean-Chinese People’s Army, they resolutely overcame the difficult years of the war and actively supported the front-line troops in achieving combat victories. Currently, in order to help the Korean people near the battle lines solve the difficulties in rebuilding their homes and restoring production, the leading organ of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has specifically allocated one million jin of grain for relief and instructed all departments to cooperate with the local government in distributing the grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 26th—For more than two years since entering Korea, the railway troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have carried forward the great spirit of internationalism and actively helped the Korean people overcome many wartime difficulties.

When the US invading army's air force wantonly bombed and destroyed peaceful cities and towns in Korea, and the Korean people's lives suffered hardships, the railway troops enthusiastically launched a campaign to save grain and relieve Korean disaster victims. According to incomplete statistics, they saved and donated a total of 265,072 *shi jin* of grain, more than 3,000 pieces of clothing, more than 7,000 pairs of shoes, and more than 900,000 *jin* of cotton to the Korean people. In May of this year, when the Seokam Reservoir was destroyed by enemy aircraft and the Korean people suffered serious disasters, a unit of the railway troops immediately sent special personnel to investigate the disaster situation, conduct rescue operations, and distribute a large amount of relief grain.

During the spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvesting seasons, commanders and fighters of the railway troops used their spare time to actively assist the Korean people in agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics, the railway troops helped the Korean people cultivate 7,775 *mu* of land, sow 3,538 *mu*, reclaim 314 *mu*, harvest 33,617 *mu*, plant 287,791 trees, repair 3,220 meters of water canals, build 579 houses, cut 63,043 *jin* of grass, and collect 980,909 *jin* of firewood. The "Yang Lian Di Company" of a certain railway unit alone helped the local Korean people plant 5,000 trees this spring.

In the common struggle against the American aggressors, the commanders and fighters of the railway troops deeply loved the Korean people. Many soldiers often risked their lives to save the lives and property of the Korean people in emergencies such as enemy bombing or floods and fires. Xu Zhaoyue, a platoon leader of a certain unit, braved enemy bombing and rescued a Korean child from heavy smoke and fire. Qu Jing, a nurse of a certain unit, voluntarily gave blood to a Korean resident who had lost too much blood after being injured by enemy aircraft, saving the life of this Korean resident. Over the past two years, commanders and fighters of the railway troops have rescued a total of 163 Korean people who were in danger of death or injury, and rescued many Korean people's houses, food, clothing and other items in disasters such as floods and fires.

One night this spring, when people were fast asleep, the hen in the landlord's house of the "Yang Lian Di Company" knocked over the brazier, and the house caught fire. Company Commander Qiu Fengzhang immediately directed the troops to put out the fire, and he himself crawled into the fire to rescue the Korean people and furniture. The fire was quickly extinguished by them. The old landlady was moved to tears and said:

"If you hadn't put out the fire, my whole family would have been burned to death. You are truly our saviors!"

In the anti-bacterial warfare, the medical and health workers of the railway troops also vigorously assisted the local Korean government in carrying out the epidemic prevention and health campaign. They inoculated Korean residents with various vaccines 11,221 times and treated more than 16,000 Korean people.

In addition, the commanders and fighters of the railway troops also actively assisted the Korean government and public security organs in maintaining rear security and helped the Korean people search the mountains for bandits and capture special agents.

The selfless assistance of the railway troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the Korean people has been admired and loved by the Korean people. Many Korean people said: We will never forget the kindness of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, for generations to come.

The Korean people also supported the railway troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army with their most sincere feelings. In 1952, the people of a certain place organized a repair team of more than 2,000 people, with more than 61,000 work hours to support the repair work of a certain unit of the railway troops. In addition, the Korean people often write letters of appreciation and send gifts to the commanders and fighters of the railway troops, and often organize small consolation groups to visit the railway troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    拨粮救济前线附近朝鲜人民
    铁道部队积极帮助朝鲜人民克服战时困难
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】中国人民志愿军领导机关最近决定拨出粮食一百万斤，救济居住在前线战区附近的朝鲜人民。
    战争期间，战区附近的朝鲜人民的生命和财产，遭到了敌炮和敌机的杀伤和严重破坏。但他们在朝鲜政府和朝中人民军队的救济和帮助下，坚毅地度过了艰苦的战争年月，并积极支援前线部队取得了战斗的胜利。目前，为了帮助战线附近的朝鲜人民解决重建家园和恢复生产中的困难，中国人民志愿军领导机关特拨出一百万斤粮食进行救济，并指示各部协同当地政府进行发放工作。
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】中国人民志愿军铁道部队入朝两年多以来，发扬了伟大的国际主义精神，积极帮助朝鲜人民克服了战时的许多困难。
    在美国侵略军空军滥肆轰炸破坏朝鲜和平城乡，朝鲜人民的生活遭受困难的时候，铁道部队的战士们曾热烈展开节约粮食救济朝鲜灾民的运动。据不完全统计，他们共节约捐献给朝鲜人民粮食二十六万五千零七十二市斤、衣服三千多件、鞋子七千多双、棉花九十多万斤。今年五月间，当石岩贮水池被敌机炸毁，朝鲜人民受到严重灾害时，铁道部队某部立即派出专人调查灾情，进行抢救，并散发了大批救济粮。
    在春耕、夏耘、秋收等季节，铁道部队指挥员、战斗员们利用空隙时间积极协助朝鲜人民进行农业生产。据不完全统计，铁道部队共帮助朝鲜人民耕地七千七百七十五亩、播种三千五百三十八亩、开荒三百一十四亩、收割三万三千六百一十七亩、植树二十八万七千七百九十一株、修水渠三千二百二十公尺、盖房子五百七十九间、割草六万三千零四十三斤、打柴九十八万九百零九斤。仅铁道部队某部“杨连第连”，在今年春天，就帮助驻地朝鲜人民植树五千棵。
    在共同反抗美国侵略者的斗争中，铁道部队指挥员战斗员们十分热爱朝鲜人民。很多战士常常在敌机轰炸或发生水灾、火灾的紧急情况下，不顾生命危险挺身抢救朝鲜人民的生命财产。某部排长徐兆月，曾冒着敌机轰炸，从浓烟烈火中救出了一名朝鲜儿童。某部护士曲镜曾自动给一位被敌机炸伤流血过多的朝鲜居民输血，救活了这个朝鲜居民的生命。两年多来，铁道部队指挥员、战斗员们共抢救出有死、伤危险的朝鲜人民一百六十三名，并在水灾、火灾等灾害中抢救出很多朝鲜人民的房屋、粮食和衣服等物品。
    在今年春天的一个深夜里，当人们正在熟睡的时候，“杨连第连”连部房东家里的母鸡弄翻了火盆，房子烧起了熊熊烈火。连长仇凤章立即指挥部队救火，自己并且钻进烈火里抢救朝鲜人民和家具。火很快被他们扑灭。房东老太太被感动得流泪说：
    “如果没有你们救火，我这一家都要被烧完了，你们真是我们的救命恩人啊！”
    在反细菌战斗争中，铁道部队的医务卫生工作人员，也大力协助驻地朝鲜政府开展防疫卫生运动。他们共给朝鲜居民注射各种防疫针一万一千二百二十一次，并给一万六千多朝鲜人民治了病。
    另外，铁道部队指挥员、战斗员们还积极协助朝鲜政府、公安机关维持后方治安，帮助朝鲜人民搜山剿匪、捕捉特务。
    中国人民志愿军铁道部队对朝鲜人民无私的帮助，受到朝鲜人民的崇敬与热爱。许多朝鲜人民说：我们世世代代不会忘记中国人民志愿军和中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的恩情。
    朝鲜人民也以最真挚的感情全力支援着中国人民志愿军铁道部队。一九五二年，某地人民曾组织了两千多人的抢修队，以六万一千多工时支援了铁道部队某部的抢修工作。此外，朝鲜人民还经常给铁道部队指挥员、战斗员写慰问信，送慰劳品，并经常组织小型慰问团，慰问中国人民志愿军铁道部队。
