How We Guide Students in Reading Literary Works
Beijing No. 4 Middle School Chinese Language Teaching and Research Group

Since liberation, one of the significant differences in the Chinese language teaching at Beijing No. 4 Middle School compared to the past is the emphasis on guiding extracurricular reading of literary works. While Chinese language teaching primarily relies on textbooks, if we only have students study around twenty lessons per semester from textbooks, even with the most ideal intensive reading, it is still insufficient. In the Soviet Union, the secondary school literature curriculum highly values extracurricular reading, with a specific reading list for students to read carefully under the guidance of teachers. In "The Story of Zoya and Shura," there is a passage describing Zoya reading many works by Chernyshevsky and articles about him. This approach is worth learning from. In our humble experience, providing good literary work reading guidance for Chinese language classes has the following four benefits:

I. Through reading literary works, we can conduct ideological and political education and cultivate a new generation with new moral qualities. In the past, many young people in our country embarked on the revolutionary path, inseparable from the strong influence of works by Gorky and Lu Xun. Today, many young people have established a revolutionary outlook on life after reading "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "The Story of Zoya and Shura." Furthermore, in their daily lives, they can overcome their shortcomings and take the heroic figures in the books as their role models. Therefore, in our reading guidance, we pay special attention to the ideological content of the original works, so that it can have the appropriate impact on students. The specific content in this regard, as Kairov discusses in pedagogy regarding the content of communist morality, is to enable students to have proletarian consciousness, patriotism, love for the people and labor, a sense of collectivism, organization, discipline, as well as excellent qualities such as honesty, integrity, courage, optimism, and perseverance. These are all qualities that the new generation of Chinese youth should possess.

II. Through reading excellent literary works, students can increase their knowledge and broaden their horizons. Because socialist realist literary works essentially represent the truth of history and life. Young students do not yet have much knowledge, and even less life experience. Reading literary works can help them learn more about things and life. When conducting reading guidance, we should ensure that students can acquire broader, more detailed, and deeper knowledge of social life and history from literary works.

III. Through reading literary works, we can cultivate students' love for literature and art and achieve the effect of aesthetic education. Today, our education hopes that the younger generation will become well-rounded individuals. In addition to moral, intellectual, and physical development, aesthetic education is a very important aspect. When guiding reading, we want students to merge with the great minds of the writers and all the beautiful sentiments expressed in the books, so that their spirits are uplifted and their emotions enriched.

IV. Through reading literary works, we must also train students in the ability to read books and think independently. We must teach students how to use reference books and libraries, so that they can solve some problems they can solve on their own through their own efforts; at the same time, we also require them to apply the methods of analyzing articles and characters taught by teachers when explaining texts, to carefully analyze and study literary works, and to gain a relatively deep understanding through their own thinking.

We determine our methods for guiding the reading of literary works based on the above understanding.

In practical work, the first step is to introduce books to students. If students are allowed to choose freely, it will be difficult for teachers to provide guidance. Because it is impossible for us to read all fifty or sixty books that students read at once, and even if we could read them all, we could only provide individual guidance, which would be labor-intensive and ineffective. In addition, if students find books on their own, the content may have problems, the literary value may not be high, or it may not be suitable for their level. Therefore, teachers must select the reading list for them in order to facilitate the guidance work and prevent spontaneous development. Before drawing up the reading list, three tasks should be done:

I. Understand the students' current reading situation and conduct a general survey to understand their reading interests and existing problems.

II. Contact the school's Party branch and Communist Youth League general branch, hoping that they will talk about their opinions on book selection and recommend some books. In recent years, the Communist Youth League has done a lot of work in guiding reading, proving that they can help teachers do this work well.

III. Understand the situation of books sold in bookstores. Some books are very good, but they cannot be bought, so they can only be temporarily excluded from the reading list.

After the above three preparations, we can select the reading list to meet the needs and be realistic. In order to facilitate centralized guidance and arouse students' widespread reading interest, we can draw up two types of reading lists: one is the designated reading list, with only three or four types for each grade; the other is the free reading list, with twenty to thirty types for each grade.

Both reading lists are selected based on the following principles:

I. The selected books should be the first-class literary works with excellent ideology and artistry that have been well-received.

II. We must take into account the interests of the students and select the books they like. Therefore, a survey should be conducted before drawing up the reading list. In addition, pay attention to students' acceptance ability and make appropriate assignments according to different grades.

III. In order to correct students' bias towards only reading novels, the reading list for each grade should appropriately coordinate poetry, drama, novels, and essays. High school sophomores and seniors should also be introduced to reading literary history, simple literary theories, and literary criticism works.

IV. The selected books are mainly works by Chinese writers that express the real life and struggles of the people, and foreign literature is mainly advanced Soviet literature. In addition, some classical and critical realist literary works should also be introduced to give students the opportunity to be exposed to various types of literature.

V. The reading list should pay attention to systematicness. For example, the works of Mr. Lu Xun will not be introduced to the first and second grades of junior high school for the time being. In the third grade of junior high school and the first grade of high school, read "Biography of Lu Xun". In the first grade of high school, selected essays and novels are read. In the second grade of high school, Lu Xun's short story collections are read, and in the third grade of high school, Lu Xun's essays are read. The content of books in each grade should also be appropriately arranged, such as "Iron Flood", "Destruction", "Chapayev", and "Defense of Tsaritsyn" are compiled together, "Happiness", "Harvest", "Gold Star Knight", and "It's Already Morning Here" are compiled together, and "Selected Works of Hu Yepin", "Selected Works of Bai Mang", "Selected Works of Rou Shi", "Selected Works of Jiang Guangci", and "Selected Works of Hong Lingfei" are compiled together.

VI. Cooperate with the works in the Chinese textbooks of each grade as much as possible. For example, there are Du Fu poems in the third grade textbook, and our reading list includes Feng Zhi's "Biography of Du Fu". There is a lesson on Ostrovsky's "Pavel Korchagin", and our reading list includes "Biography of Ostrovsky", "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "Collection of Speeches, Essays and Letters by Ostrovsky".

Our school spends a lot of book fees every semester to purchase literary books, and designated reading books have now been made available to everyone. That is, the three or four designated reading books selected for each grade, we purchase on average according to the number of students in the class. This not only meets the students' reading requirements, but also facilitates our guidance. In addition, each of the thirty or forty books listed on the free reading list for each grade has multiple copies in the library to facilitate students' borrowing.

The methods we have explored for teachers to guide students in reading literary works are as follows:

Before the start of the semester, we select the reading list, and the teacher first reads the designated reading books for the grade they teach in detail. According to our experience, this work is best done during winter and summer vacations, because it is busy after the start of the semester, and there is no time for careful reading. If the teacher does not read carefully, they cannot guide the students well. After the teacher has prepared calmly, the teachers of the same grade can discuss it once to seek a more correct and thorough understanding of the original work.

When the teacher distributes the designated reading books to the students, they must introduce them and tell the students what they should pay attention to when reading. In the introduction, the basic spirit of the book, the background of the times, the life of the author, and the status of the work in literary history should all be briefly explained. The main purpose of doing this is to arouse students' interest in reading. The introduction methods are also not all the same. For example, many novels in "Lu Xun's Short Story Collection" can point out which ones are more representative and which ones should be read first. For example, "An Ordinary Soldier" and "The Story of Zoya and Shura" should pay special attention to the revolutionary qualities of the heroes. For example, "Virgin Soil Upturned" and "Days and Nights" have successfully written typical characters, and more attention should be paid to this aspect. In short, we should propose different key points to students according to different books.

For some literary works with strong storytelling in the first and second grades of junior high school, when we introduce them, the teacher can first talk about them in the form of storytelling, arousing the urgent desire of children to know the content in more detail, thereby increasing their reading interest.

After the introduction, reading can begin. In order to facilitate collective learning, students who read the same book are formed into a group, so that each class has three or four groups. Students generally read in their spare time, and our school also has a reading time once every two weeks on the timetable. In this lesson, instead of reading books, we have group discussions. The teacher circulates to participate in the discussions of each group and answers various questions raised by the students. In order to ensure that the discussions are good, the teacher should preferably arrange the progress in advance according to the two-week time period, prepare discussion outlines, and require students to consciously abide by the learning discipline and finish reading according to the progress.

After two or three discussions, guide students to write reading reports. Except for the first grade of junior high school, students in each grade in our school write at least one reading report per semester. This reading report includes a summary of the content,心得 [personal understanding], thoughts, analysis of the work's art, and excerpts.

Finally, after the teacher carefully reviews these reading reports, they should make a comment when returning them, which is the summary of this reading. The ideological gains should be pointed out, and students should be enthusiastically encouraged to continue their efforts and show the improvement of ideological understanding in practice. Secondly, based on relevant critical texts in newspapers and periodicals, the advantages and disadvantages of the book can be analyzed in depth. For example, Comrade Feng Xuefeng's review article on "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River" (originally published in "Literary Gazette") can be used as material for the reading summary report of this book to the students. At the same time, we will introduce students to other important works by the same author, or books with similar themes, to expand students' reading scope and consolidate and improve their ideological gains and reading interest.

In terms of free reading, in addition to printing and publishing the recommended reading list mentioned above, we also encourage students to borrow at any time. For example, for books in the reading list that are related to the textbook, we introduce them to the students after finishing the lesson. On our free reading list, we write a sentence or two after each book title to introduce its content. In this way, students will not be completely ignorant before borrowing the book. In terms of free reading, we also often introduce students to excellent works recently published in magazines or newspapers at any time. According to the students' feedback, they very much welcome this kind of reading guidance, because there are many magazines and newspapers, and they sometimes don't know which article to read, and sometimes they will overlook good articles.

To do a good job in reading guidance and truly play a guiding role in students' thoughts, we must first understand what problems exist in students' thoughts, so that we can be targeted. Therefore, in the process of reading, we must always contact the Communist Youth League, Young Pioneers, and class committee students, and understand the students' ideological situation through them, which will have a greater effect.

Finally, there are some more special methods to assist reading guidance, and we should seize various opportunities to carry them out. For example, when literary masterpieces adapted into movies or dramas are staged, encourage students to watch them. Students who have read the book will have a further understanding of the work after watching the movie or drama; students who have not read the book can arouse their interest in reading this masterpiece. If it is not a drama adapted from a book, then by watching the performance, you can introduce them to read the original script. Sometimes organize students to listen to reports from writers about their creative experiences and visit writers. In addition, if it is a book that the whole school loves to read together, you can hold an expanded symposium with teachers and students participating, or hold a work recitation meeting or a writer memorial meeting, which can arouse more students' love for literature and art.

    我们怎样指导同学阅读文艺作品
    北京市第四中学语文教学研究组
    北京市第四中学从解放以来，在语文教学上和过去显著不同点之一就是重视了课外阅读文学作品指导的工作。语文教学主要的是依靠课本来进行的，但是我们如果只让学生每一学期学习课本上二十篇上下的课文，即使是做到最理想的精读也还是不够的。在苏联，中学的文学课程上就非常重视课外阅读，有一定的书目要学生在教师指导下认真阅读。在“卓娅和舒拉的故事”里就有一段叙述卓娅看了许多车尔尼雪夫斯基的著作和有关他的文章。这种做法，是值得我们学习的。以我们粗浅的体会，对语文课很好地进行文学作品阅读指导，具有下列四点意义：
    一、通过文学作品的阅读，可以进行思想政治教育，培养新的一代新的道德品质。过去我国很多青年走上革命的道路，是与高尔基和鲁迅等的作品的强烈影响分不开的。今天也有很多青年读了“钢铁是怎样炼成的”“卓娅和舒拉的故事”以后，建立了革命人生观。并且在日常生活实践中，能克服自己缺点，以书中的英雄人物作为自己的榜样。因此，我们在阅读指导中，特别注意原作的思想性，使它在同学中产生应有的影响。这方面的具体内容如凯洛夫在教育学中论及共产主义道德内容时所说的，是使学生具有无产阶级意识，爱国主义精神，爱人民、爱劳动的情感，集体观念，组织性，纪律性以及诚实、正直、勇敢、乐观坚韧等优良品质。这都是新中国青年一代应该具备的。
    二、通过优秀文学作品的阅读，可以使同学们增加知识，扩大眼界。因为社会主义的现实主义文学作品，都是本质地表现了历史和生活的真实。年轻的同学知识还不多，生活经验更加少，读文学作品正可以帮助他们多了解一些事物和生活。我们在进行阅读指导的时候，应该做到使同学能从文学作品中、获取更广泛、更细致、更深刻的社会生活的和历史的知识。
    三、通过文学作品的阅读，可以培养同学们对文学艺术的热爱，收到美育的效果。今天我们的教育希望青年一代成为全面发展的人，在德、智、体、三者之外，美育是非常重要的一环。在指导阅读时，我们要让同学和作家的伟大心灵，以及书中所表现的一切优美情操相融合，使他们的精神向上，情感丰富。
    四、通过文学作品的阅读，我们还要训练同学们自己阅读书籍和独立思考的能力。必须教会同学们运用工具书的方法，利用图书馆的方法，让他们依靠自己的努力解决一些他们可以自己解决的问题；同时，也要求他们能够运用教师在讲解课文的时候的分析文章、分析人物的方法，对文学作品用心分析研究，凭自己的思考，得到比较深刻的体会。
    我们就是根据以上的认识来确定指导文学作品阅读的办法。
    在具体工作上，第一步是介绍书籍给同学们看。倘若让同学们自由选择，教师就难以进行指导。因为我们不可能将同学们看的五六十种书都一下看完，即使能看完也只能进行个别指导，费力大，效果不会好的。此外，由同学们自己找书看，也很可能内容有问题，文学价值不高，或是不合程度。所以教师必须为他们选定书目，才能便于指导工作的进行和防止自流现象。在拟订书目前，应该做三项工作：
    一、了解学生目前阅读情况，做一次普遍调查，了解他们的阅读兴趣和存在的问题。二、和学校的党支部、团总支联系，希望他们谈谈对选书的意见和推荐一些书。近年来团在指导阅读方面做过很多工作，证明他们是可以帮助教师做好这项工作的。三、了解一下书店中出售书籍的情况，有些书很好，但买不到，暂时只好不列在书目里。
    经过以上三项准备工作，我们选定书目，才可以针对需要，切合实际。为了便于集中指导又引起同学们广泛阅读的兴趣，可以拟定两种书目：一种是指定阅读书目，每年级只有三种或四种：一种是自由阅读书目，每年级有二十到三十种。
    这两种书目都是本着下述原则选定的：
    一、选的书应该尽量选思想性艺术性都属上乘，获得定评的第一流文艺作品。
    二、要照顾到同学的兴趣，选他们所喜爱的书。因此在拟订书目以前，要进行调查工作。并且，要注意学生接受能力，按照不同年级作适宜的分配。
    三、为了纠正同学只爱看小说的偏向，在各年级的书目中，将诗歌、戏剧、小说、散文，作适宜的配合。高二高三还应该介绍阅读文学史，浅显的文艺理论和文艺批评的著作。
    四、选的书，主要的是我国作家的表现人民现实生活和斗争的作品，外国文学也以先进的苏联文学为主，此外，也要介绍一些古典的和批判的现实主义文学作品，使同学们有接触各类文学的机会。
    五、书目注意系统性。例如鲁迅先生的作品，初一、初二暂不介绍，初三、高一看鲁迅传，高一选读部分散文和小说，高二读鲁迅小说集，高三读鲁迅杂文。在各个年级中书籍内容也要适当编配，如“铁流”、“毁灭”、“夏伯阳”、“保卫察里津”等编在一起，“幸福”、“收获”、“金星骑士”、“我们这里已是早晨”等编在一起，“胡也频选集”、“白莽选集”、“柔石选集”、“蒋光慈选集”、“洪灵菲选集”等编在一起。
    六、尽可能配合各年级语文课本上的作品。例如高三课本上有杜甫诗，我们的书目中就开列了冯至的“杜甫传”。有奥斯特洛夫斯基的“保尔·柯察金”一课，我们的书目中就开列了“奥斯特洛夫斯基传”、“钢铁就是这样炼成的”和“奥斯特洛夫斯基演讲、论文、书信集”。
    我校每学期都用不少的图书费来添购文学书籍，指定阅读的书现已做到人手一册。就是每年级所选定的三、四种指定阅读书，我们按照班上人数，平均购置。这不仅满足了同学们阅读的要求，也便利了我们进行指导。另外，各年级自由阅读书目上开列的三四十种书，在图书馆每种都有复本，便利同学借阅。
    教师对同学阅读文学作品的指导工作，我们摸索得来的办法是这样的：
    在开学以前就选定书目，教师首先就将任课年级的指定阅读书，精细阅读。根据我们的经验，这工作最好在寒假和暑假做，因为开学后工作繁忙，就没有时间精读了。教师如不精读，就不能很好地指导同学。教师从容准备后，可以由同年级教师先讨论一次，以求对原作有更正确周密的理解。
    教师将指定阅读书发给同学的时候，必须进行介绍，告诉同学阅读时应该注意什么。在介绍时，要将这本书的基本精神、时代背景、作者生平和这作品在文学史上的地位，都作概括的说明。这样做，主要是引起同学阅读兴趣。介绍的方法，也不全一样。如“鲁迅小说集”里面的许多篇小说，可以指出那些更有代表性，那几篇应先读。如“普通一兵”“卓娅和舒拉的故事”，应该特别注意英雄们的革命品质。如“被开垦的处女地”、“日日夜夜”人物典型写得很成功，应该多在这方面注意。总之，我们应根据不同的书籍，向学生提出不同的重点。
    初中一、二年级某些故事性强的文艺作品，我们在介绍的时候，由教师用讲故事的方式先谈一下，引起少年儿童要更详细地知道内容的迫切要求，因而增加了阅读兴趣。
    介绍以后，就可以进行阅读。为了便于集体学习，将同看一种书的同学编成一个小组，这样，各班就有三、四个小组。学生们一般阅读的时间是在课外，我们学校课程表上，每两周也有一次阅读时间。在这一课上，就不是看书，而是分成小组讨论。教师巡回参加各组的讨论，并解答学生们提出的各种问题。为了保证讨论得好，教师最好按两星期时间，预先布置进度，编拟讨论提纲，要求同学一定自觉地遵守学习纪律，按照进度看完。
    经过两三次讨论后，就指导学生写阅读报告。我们学校除初一以外，各年级学生每学期都至少写一篇读书报告。这个读书报告，包括内容提要、心得、感想、作品艺术的分析和摘录。
    最后，教师将这些读书报告仔细批阅后，在发还的时候，应该做一次讲评，这也就是这次阅读的总结。应该指出在思想上的收获，并且热情地鼓舞同学继续努力，将思想认识的提高，从实践中表现出来。其次，可以根据报刊上有关的批评文字，深入地分析本书的优缺点。例如，对“太阳照在桑干河上”一书，冯雪峰同志的评论文章（原载“文艺报”），就可以用来向同学做这本书阅读总结报告的材料。同时，我们再向同学介绍同一作者其他重要作品，或别的主题类似的书，来扩大同学的阅读范围，巩固和提高他们的思想收获和阅读兴趣。
    在自由阅读方面，除了前面所说的编好推荐书目油印公布以外，我们也随时鼓励同学们去借阅。如书目中和课文相关的书，我们就在讲完这课书后，介绍给同学们。在我们编订的自由阅读书目上每个书名后面，我们都写了一两句话，介绍它的内容。这样让同学不致在没有借阅这本书前毫无所知。在自由阅读方面，我们还经常将新近发表在杂志或报纸上的优秀作品，随时介绍给同学们看。据同学们反映，他们十分欢迎这种阅读指导，因为杂志、报纸很多，他们有时不知道该看哪篇文章，有时也会把好文章忽略了。
    要做好阅读指导工作，真正能在学生思想上起指导作用，必须首先了解学生思想上存在些什么问题，这样才能有的放矢。因此在阅读过程中，一定要和团、队以及班干部同学经常联系，通过他们了解同学思想情况，那就会收到更大的效果。
    最后，还有一些比较特殊的协助阅读指导的办法，我们应该抓紧各种机会进行。例如文学名著改编成的电影或戏剧上演的时候，鼓励同学去看，已看过这本著作的同学看完电影或戏剧以后，对作品会有进一步的体会；没有看过这部书的同学，就可以引起他要看这部名著的兴趣。如果并非改编而成的戏剧，那么，通过看演出，可以介绍他们去读原剧本。有时组织学生去听作家谈创作经验的报告和访问作家。再有，如果是全校共同爱读的书，可举行扩大座谈会，师生都参加，或是举办作品朗诵会、作家纪念会，这都可以引起更多的同学对文艺的爱好。
