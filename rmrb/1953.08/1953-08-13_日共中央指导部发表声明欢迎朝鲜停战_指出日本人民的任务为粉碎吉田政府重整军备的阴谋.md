Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on July 27, regarding the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, saying: The realization of the Korean armistice signifies the political and military victory of the people, and the defeat of the war-mongering American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique.

The statement, after analyzing the reasons for the Korean people's victory, said: Due to the victory of the Korean people, the ambition of the imperialists headed by the United States to encircle the Soviet Union and strangle the people's democratic countries has been shattered in one corner of Korea. The angry tide of people in the Far East demanding national liberation, democracy, and freedom is rising throughout the Far East and the world. Imperialists and their running dogs are engaging in a more violent death struggle. They are stepping up the militarization of Japan, promoting rearmament, and turning Japan into a second Korea. The vanguard in this collusion is the traitorous Yoshida government.

The statement then pointed out: The task of the Japanese people is to smash the Yoshida government's conspiracy and unite all Japanese people who desire peace, friendly trade, and freedom.

    日共中央指导部发表声明欢迎朝鲜停战
    指出日本人民的任务为粉碎吉田政府重整军备的阴谋 【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：日本共产党中央指导部于七月二十七日就朝鲜停战协定签字发表声明说：朝鲜停战的实现，意味着人民的政治和军事的胜利，发动战争的美帝国主义者和李承晚集团的失败。
    声明在分析了朝鲜人民取得胜利的原因之后说：由于朝鲜人民的胜利，以美国为首的帝国主义者企图包围苏联和扼杀人民民主国家的野心，已经在朝鲜一角被粉碎了。远东人民要求民族解放、民主、自由的怒涛，正在整个远东和全世界高涨起来。帝国主义和他们的走狗更加狂暴地进行垂死挣扎。他们正在日本加紧进行军事基地化、促进重整军备和变日本为第二个朝鲜的勾当。在这种勾当中充当开路先锋的就是吉田卖国政府。
    声明接着指出：日本人民的任务就是粉碎吉田政府的阴谋，让所有希望和平、友好贸易和自由的日本人民团结起来。
