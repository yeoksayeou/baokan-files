    Why the Armyworm Infestation in Gushan Village Has Not Been Eradicated After More Than Ten Days
    Ma Shiji, Song Zhizhu
    In Gushan Village, Fourth District, Datong County, Shanxi Province, there is a depression of over ninety mu bordering rivers on both sides. On July 3rd, many armyworms appeared in this area, devouring the naked oats until only bare stalks remained; the millet and corn planted in this area also suffered severe damage. After the pest infestation occurred, Liang Jintang, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Datong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, led seven or eight cadres to the village to guide the masses in capturing and killing the pests. However, the pest infestation was still spreading by mid-July. What is the reason for this?
    First, the principle of "early treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment" was not resolutely implemented. Originally, the pest infestation was concentrated in an area of over ninety mu. As long as two hundred people used the method of digging ditches for blockade and surrounding the area layer by layer, capturing and killing the pests from the outside to the inside, it could have been completely eradicated in two days. However, because the method of thoroughly eliminating the pests and organizing the masses to wipe them out was not implemented, people were only satisfied with the number of catties caught and the ditches dug for blockade. Therefore, although some of the pests were eliminated, the spread of the pests could not be prevented. Although some blockade ditches were dug, they were scattered and sporadic, and could not play a blocking role.
    Second, the cadres were hesitant and timid in leading the pest control work. After the movement against bureaucracy and against coercion and commandism, some district and county cadres developed the erroneous idea of not daring to boldly mobilize and organize the masses. For example, some people in this village believed that armyworms were "god worms" and could not be resisted; others only cared about weeding the seedlings and were not actively engaged in pest control. When the cadres saw this phenomenon, they did not actively try to educate them. In this way, the cadres did not dare to actively lead the masses, and naturally the pest control work could not be formed into a mass movement, and the pest control effect was not good.

    孤山村的粘虫为什么十多天还没有扑灭
    马石纪  宋之洙
    山西大同县四区孤山村，有一片两侧临河九十余亩大的凹地。七月三日，这片地里发生了很多粘虫，把莜麦吃成了光杆；种在这片地里的谷子、玉米也遭到严重的危害。虫害发生后，中共大同县委会组织部副部长梁纪堂就带领七、八个干部到这个村领导群众捕打。可是一直到七月中旬虫害还在蔓延。这是什么原因呢？
    第一、没有坚决执行“及早治、连续治、彻底治”的方针。本来集中在九十多亩地里的虫害，只要有二百人用挖沟封锁、层层包围的办法，由外往里捕打，两天时间就可以消灭干净。但因为没有执行彻底消灭，组织群众把虫子一网打尽的办法，只满足于已经捉了多少斤和挖了封锁沟，因此，虫子虽然被消灭了一部分，但却不能阻止住虫子的蔓延。封锁沟虽然挖了一些，但是由于断断续续、零零散散地分布各处，也不能起到封锁的作用。
    第二、干部在领导治虫工作中束手束脚。有些区县干部经过反对官僚主义、反对强迫命令的运动以后，又产生了不敢大胆发动群众和组织群众的错误思想。例如这个村的群众有的认为粘虫是神虫不能抵抗；有的只顾锄苗，不积极治虫。干部看到了这种现象，也不积极设法进行教育。这样干部不敢积极领导群众，自然治虫工作就不能形成为一种群众运动，治虫效果也就不好了。
