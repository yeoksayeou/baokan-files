    Mechanical Plant No. 21 Completes National Production Plan Monthly for Eighteen Months

    [This newspaper reported] For eighteen months, State-owned Mechanical Plant No. 21 has completed the national production plan on a monthly basis, achieving the important indicators required by the state, such as total commodity value, total production value, and labor productivity (only in two months last year did it fail to meet the total commodity value target). Looking at the annual and quarterly situation, the plant completed 163.13 percent of the national plan in 1952, exceeding the actual output of 1951 by more than double. Labor productivity increased by 54 percent compared to the plan, and costs decreased by 19.85 percent. In the first quarter of this year, the total production value exceeded the plan by 2.2 percent, the total commodity value exceeded the plan by 4.7 percent, and labor productivity increased by 0.4 percent. In the second quarter, the total production value exceeded the plan by 5.5 percent, the total commodity value exceeded the plan by 1.4 percent, and labor productivity increased by 6.6 percent. Furthermore, looking at the production efficiency of the main product, road rollers, with January of last year as 100, it reached 430 in June of this year, an increase of more than threefold.

    The mechanical equipment of Mechanical Plant No. 21 is mostly left over from the Japanese invaders, and is old and dilapidated. Among all the workshops in the plant, the mechanical processing workshop can be considered to have the best equipment, but new electric rolling machine tools only account for one-third, while old-fashioned belt lathes account for two-thirds, and the equipment is very unbalanced. Planing machines, drilling machines, and slotting machines are insufficient and far behind the needs of production. There is also a shortage of skilled workers, with workers of grade four and above accounting for only one-sixth of the total number of workers in the workshop. Most of the workers in the riveting workshop work in the open air, enduring the scorching sun in the hot summer and the wind and snow in the severe winter. On rainy days, they have to be forced to stop work. Because the leading cadres of the plant deeply realized the importance of completing the national production plan, they actively educated and mobilized the workers to overcome various difficulties. For example, the plant changed its production tasks three times from March to June this year, which increased many difficulties in production. After the plant received the task of transforming road roller production into drilling rig production in March of this year in November last year, the leading cadres, in the face of old equipment, few skilled workers, and tight year-end production, selected 20 people, including section chiefs, workshop directors, foremen, and technical workers, to actively prepare for trial production in all aspects. After the trial production began in March of this year, some cadres and workers believed: "The equipment is too old and the technology is not skilled enough, so it is impossible to do this precision work." The leading cadres carried out education against this conservative thinking that emphasized objective difficulties: "When engaging in planned economic construction, is it possible to throw away all the old machines and replace them with new machines? This is impossible. All new machines are produced on old machines. It doesn't matter if the technology is not skilled, it will gradually become skilled. The important thing is that we cannot sit and wait for the conditions to be met before we work, but we must actively strive for the conditions and have the confidence to overcome these difficulties." At the same time, they mobilized everyone to find ways to overcome the difficulties: there were not enough of thirteen kinds of steel, so substitutes were found; there were not enough milling machines and planing machines, so three shifts were implemented; there were not enough skilled workers, so they were transferred from the repair and tool workshops; the horizontal lathe and universal milling machine needed major repairs, so they were repaired in a concentrated effort for half a month; there were no operating procedures, so they were formulated and implemented simultaneously; and finally, the trial production and small-scale production tasks were successfully completed. At the beginning of April, the plant received instructions from higher authorities to immediately switch back to the production of road rollers. All of a sudden, materials, jigs, indicator charts, labor organization... everything was disrupted again, and the preparation time for mass production was only twenty days, which was really a lot of difficulties. However, the leading cadres of the plant realized that it was their responsibility to implement the national plan without compromise, so they repeatedly explained the political significance of this change of task to the workers. At the same time, they mobilized the workers to tap potential and found ways to overcome the difficulties, shortening the production progress by seven days. The workers also researched and proposed rationalization proposals such as improving drilling methods, which increased production efficiency by two times, and finally completed the task. In June, they received instructions from higher authorities to stop the production of road rollers and switch to the production of drilling rigs, and they also completed the task instructed by the higher authorities.

    The leading cadres of Mechanical Plant No. 21 treat the national plan with a serious attitude, and often launch sharp criticism against those who cannot resolutely implement the plan. In recent years, through the education of many specific examples, many cadres have also strengthened their sense of responsibility for implementing the national plan. Group leaders and workers now generally believe that it is extremely disgraceful and unseemly to fail to complete the plan.

    In order to ensure the completion of the national production plan, the plant has established some good systems. Production meetings are often used to concentrate efforts to solve key problems. No matter how tense the central movement is, the plant must hold a production meeting at the beginning of each month. At the production meeting, the leading cadres and cadres of the sections and workshops carefully analyze and study what are the key problems that need to be solved urgently to complete the task of the month, find solutions one by one, stipulate the execution period and the person in charge, and then print out the resolutions and distribute them to the sections and workshops as the director's orders to be executed. Because this system has obvious advantages, each workshop first convenes cadres to study the key production problems of the workshop after receiving the production task, and concentrates efforts to solve them. For example, in May of this year, due to the impact of the change of tasks, the processing workshop did not supply parts in time, so that the assembly workshop only completed one-third of the plan by the tenth. The assembly workshop studied that the main key to completing the plan was to change the labor organization, so it mobilized the various groups to implement the method of working across processes according to the work sequence. As a result, the task was completed on time without working overtime. In order to ensure the completion of the production plan, the plant often checks the implementation of the plan. The director of the plant often goes deep into the workshops to focus on checking the work and urging improvements; the chief of the production section also goes to the workshops to check two or three times every day according to the short lines on the indicator charts, and actively helps to solve problems as soon as they are discovered. In order to correctly grasp the situation, they also select activists among the workers in each workshop to maintain close contact, so that the errors of responsible cadres in some workshops who falsely report achievements and conceal shortcomings can also be exposed in time. Because the production tasks are grasped tightly, the production preparation work is done in a timely manner, and the production situation is thoroughly understood, each central movement has not affected the completion of the production tasks. For example, during the "Three-Anti" campaign last year, the plant's production not only did not decrease, but increased month by month.

    Relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses is one of the main reasons why the plant often completes the national plan. After the production meeting is held at the beginning of each month, the director must report the production task and production key points of the month to the general branch committee of the Party, determine the division of labor of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League at the meeting, and then convene Party meetings inside and outside the Party to deploy and mobilize, which has also become one of the regular systems. The Party organization often checks the completion of the national plan by all employees, especially Party members, and the requirements are very strict. The secretary of the general branch often pointed out at Party meetings: "Failure to complete the administrative task is failure to complete the Party's task; whether the national plan can be completed is a test of the Party spirit of Party members!" Relying on the masses, any arduous task can be completed. In November last year, in the windy and snowy weather, the workers in the riveting workshop were still working in the open air, and it happened to be a power outage for those few days. Seeing that the sugar pot task was about to fail, the secretary of the Party general branch mobilized everyone to discuss how to complete the national production task. The employees displayed great enthusiasm and worked actively, and finally produced the sugar pots on schedule.

    Strengthening planning management provides an important guarantee for the plant to complete the national plan. The plant began to compile operational plans in June last year and promoted the production indicator charts, which gradually played a role in supervising and guiding production, and initially established a scheduling system, which greatly reversed the chaotic production situation. For example, the mechanical processing workshop used to work hard on easy jobs, and the output could be backlogged for two or three months without being used up, while urgent jobs were not done, which affected the completion of the assembly workshop's task; the riveting workshop would transfer all the workers to rush to work on whatever was busy, and there were always about fifteen people who stopped working every day. This kind of disorderly phenomenon has been overcome after the promotion of indicator charts, the phenomenon of work stoppage due to lack of materials has been greatly reduced, the production cycle has been reduced from sixteen days to ten days, and production efficiency has been significantly improved.

    Mechanical Plant No. 21 has made achievements in production, but it must not be complacent. The main shortcomings that exist now are that it cannot complete the national plan in a comprehensive and balanced manner. The cost reduction in the second quarter of this year did not meet the target, and production is still very unbalanced between the various workshops, and within the workshops, work sections, and groups; the quality of the products is not high, and the foundry workshop still has 7% waste products, and there are nearly half of the surplus labor force; the promotion of advanced experience is not good enough; labor discipline is lax; and political work is still very weak. This shows that there is still great potential within the plant. The plant must further strengthen planning management to achieve comprehensive, balanced, and over-fulfilled completion of the national production plan. (Xue Yong)

    机械二十一厂十八个月来
    按月完成国家生产计划
    【本报讯】十八个月来，国营机械二十一厂按月完成国家生产计划，实现国家所要求的商品总值、生产总值、劳动生产率等重要指标（只去年有两个月没完成商品总值指标）。从年度、季度情况来看，一九五二年全年该厂完成国家计划百分之一百六十三点一三，超过一九五一年实际产量一倍强，劳动生产率比计划提高百分之五十四，成本降低百分之十九点八五。今年第一季生产总值超过计划百分之二点二，商品总值超过计划百分之四点七，劳动生产率提高百分之零点四。第二季生产总值超过计划百分之五点五，商品总值超过计划百分之一点四，劳动生产率提高百分之六点六。再从主要产品压道机的生产效率来看，以去年一月为一百，今年六月就达到四百三十，提高三倍以上。
    机械二十一厂的机械设备绝大部分是日寇遗留下来的，年久、破旧，在全厂各车间中设备最好的算是机械加工车间，但是新式电滚机床只占三分之一，旧式皮带车床倒占了三分之二，设备很不平衡，刨床、钻床、插床不够用，远远落后于生产的需要。技术工人也很缺乏，四级以上的工人只占全车间工人六分之一。铆工车间大部分工人在露天干活，暑天冒着烈日的烤炙，严冬受着风雪的侵袭，在下雨天，就得被迫停工。由于该厂的领导干部深刻认识到完成国家生产计划的重要性，积极教育和发动职工，克服了种种困难。例如该厂从今年三月到六月，曾变更了三次生产任务，增加了生产上很多的困难。去年十一月该厂接到要在今年三月把压道机生产转变为钻探机生产的任务以后，领导干部在设备旧、技术工人少、年终生产紧张等情况下，抽调出科长、车间主任、工长、技术工人等二十人，从各方面积极做好试造的准备工作。今年三月开始试造以后，有些干部、工人认为：“设备太旧、技术不熟练，不可能干这个精密活。”领导干部针对这种强调客观困难的保守思想进行了教育：“搞有计划的经济建设，能不能把旧机器都扔掉，换上新机器呢？这是不可能的。一切新机器都是在旧机器上生产出来的。技术不熟练不要紧，慢慢会熟练的。重要的是咱们不能坐等条件具备了才干，要主动去争取条件，要有克服这些困难的信心。”同时，又发动大家想办法克服困难：十三种钢材不够用，找到了代用品；铣床、刨床不够，实行了三班倒；技术工人不足，从修建、工具车间抽调；躺镟床、万能铣床要大修，突击半个月修好；没有操作规程，就一面制订、一面贯彻；终于胜利地完成了试造和小量生产的任务。四月初该厂又接到上级指示，要立刻改产压道机。这一下子，材料，工卡具、指示图表、劳动组织……一切又被打乱了，大批生产的准备时间又只不过二十天，真是困难一大堆。可是该厂的领导干部认识到不折不扣地执行国家计划，是自己的责任，就反复向职工解释这次改变任务的政治意义，同时发动职工挖掘潜在力，找到了克服困难的办法，将生产进度缩短七天，工人又研究出改进钻眼方法等合理化建议，提高了生产效率二倍，终于完成了任务。六月份又接到上级指示停产压道机，改产钻探机，也同样完成了上级指示的任务。
    机械二十一厂的领导干部以严肃的态度对待国家计划，对不能坚决执行计划的人，经常展开尖锐的批评。几年来，通过许多具体事例的教育，许多干部也都加强了执行国家计划的责任心。小组长和工人现在普遍认为不能完成计划是极不光采，极不体面的事情。
    为了保证完成国家生产计划，该厂建立了一些良好的制度。经常运用生产会议的方式，来集中力量解决关键问题。无论中心运动怎样紧张，该厂在每月月初也一定要召开生产会议。在生产会议上，领导干部和科室、车间干部周密地分析研究完成本月任务急需解决的关键问题是什么，一项项找出解决的办法、规定执行的期限和负责人，然后把决议印出来分发给各科室、车间，作为厂长的命令来执行。由于这一制度具有明显的优点，因此各车间在接到生产任务以后，也首先召集干部研究车间生产关键问题，集中力量加以解决。例如今年五月由于改变任务的影响，加工车间供应零件不及时，使装配车间到十日才完成计划的三分之一，装配车间研究出完成计划的主要关键是改变劳动组织，就发动各个小组实行按照工序跨着干的办法，结果也没加班突击就按时完成了任务。该厂为了保证完成生产计划，经常检查执行计划的情况。该厂厂长经常深入车间重点检查工作，督促改进；生产科科长每天也必定根据指示图表上的短线，到各车间检查两三次，发现问题立刻主动帮助解决。为了正确掌握情况，他们还在各车间工人中选择积极分子，密切联系，这样，有的车间负责干部谎报成绩、隐瞒缺点的错误也都能及时被揭发出来。由于对生产任务抓得紧、生产准备工作做得及时，对生产情况摸得透，所以每次中心运动都没有影响生产任务的完成，如去年“三反”时，该厂生产不但没有降低，反而一月比一月提高。
    依靠群众、发动群众是该厂经常完成国家计划的主要原因之一。在每月月初生产会议开过以后，厂长都要向党总支委员会报告本月生产任务和生产关键，在会上确定党、行政、工会、青年团的分工，然后分别召开党内党外会议进行布置、发动，这也已经成为经常的制度之一。党组织对全体职工特别是对党员完成国家计划，经常检查，要求是非常严格的，总支书记经常在党的会议上这样指出：“不能完成行政任务，就是没有完成党的任务；能否完成国家计划，就是对党员党性的考验！”依靠群众，什么艰巨的任务都能完成。去年十一月，刮风下雪的天气，铆工车间工人还在露天工作，而那几天又正巧停电，眼看糖罐任务要不能完成，党总支书记就发动大家讨论如何完成国家生产任务，职工发挥了高度热情，积极工作，终于把糖罐按期生产出来。
    加强计划管理，为该厂完成国家计划提供了重要保证。该厂在去年六月开始编制作业计划，推广生产指示图表，使它逐渐发挥了监督、指导生产的作用，并初步建立了调度制度，生产混乱的现象有了很大的扭转。如机械加工车间过去好干的活猛干，生产品能积压两三个月用不完，而急要的活反而不干，影响装配车间任务的完成；铆工车间看什么活忙，就把工人一齐调去突击，每天总有十五个人左右停工。像这种无秩序的现象，在推广指示图表以后都克服了，停工待料现象大为减少，生产周期从十六天减到十天，生产效率显著地提高了。
    机械二十一厂生产是有成绩的，但是决不能自满。他们现在存在的缺点主要是还不能全面、均衡地完成国家计划。今年第二季度降低成本没有达到指标，而在各个车间之间，和车间、工段、小组内部，生产还很不均衡；产品的质量不高，翻砂车间还有百分之七的废品，并且有将近一半的剩余劳动力；先进经验的推广不够好；劳动纪律松弛；政治工作还很薄弱。这说明该厂内部还有很大的潜在力。该厂必须进一步加强计划管理，做到全面、均衡、超额地完成国家计划。（雪雍）
