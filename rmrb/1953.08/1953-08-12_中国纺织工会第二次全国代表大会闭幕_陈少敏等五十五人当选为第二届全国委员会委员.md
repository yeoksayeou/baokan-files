    The Second National Congress of the China Textile Trade Union successfully concluded on the 10th after a six-day meeting.

    At this congress, the delegates listened to, discussed, and adopted the report made by Chen Shaomin, "Basic Summary of the Work of the China Textile Trade Union in the Past Three Years and Future Tasks," and listened to the work report of Chen Weiji, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government. The delegates also adopted "Several Decisions on Organizational Issues," abolished the Charter of the China Textile Trade Union passed by the First National Congress of the China Textile Trade Union, and resolutely implemented the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China.

    When the congress passed the congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao and the congratulatory telegram to the Chinese People's Volunteers, the entire audience stood up, applauded and cheered. The congress also passed a letter of greetings to the Textile and Garment Workers' Trade Unions International.

    On the sixth day of the congress, the delegates elected Chen Shaomin and 54 others as members of the Second National Committee of the China Textile Trade Union; elected Min Shufen, Wang Shumei and 14 others as alternate members of the Second National Committee of the China Textile Trade Union; and elected Wang Huasheng, Gong Hui and 5 others as members of the Second National Expenditure Examination Committee of the China Textile Trade Union. The Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government and the National Committee of the China Textile Trade Union held an award ceremony at the congress. One hundred and six textile industry labor models and all employees of twenty-four model units received honorary and material awards. Following this, Chen Shaomin delivered a concluding report. He said: During the period of the state's First Five-Year Plan, the overall goal of the entire staff and workers in the textile system is to: improve machine efficiency, improve equipment utilization rate, and, in accordance with the requirements of the national plan, ensure the completion of the various tasks stipulated by the state. To this end, it is necessary to effectively summarize and promote advanced experiences, improve workers' technical skills and proficiency, improve working conditions, and improve enterprise management in order to increase production, improve quality, reduce costs, meet the people's growing clothing needs, and accumulate funds to lay a good foundation for future development. The current task is to improve quality, improve varieties, reduce costs, and ensure the completion of this year's production plan. After Chen Shaomin specifically analyzed the current textile production situation, he pointed out that the machine efficiency of most factories has not been fully utilized. He instructed textile trade union organizations at all levels to urgently strengthen the concept of economic accounting, organize textile workers to calculate detailed accounts, tap potential, and raise the production level of private, joint state-private, local state-owned, and a few poorly performing state-owned factories to the level of advanced factories. Improving machine efficiency is not simply increasing the number of machine revolutions; leadership must be strengthened in terms of politics, technology, and enterprise management, and steady progress must be made on the basis of improving all aspects of work, gradually improving, opposing conservatism, and also opposing rash advances. Then, Chen Shaomin emphasized: As the country enters a period of planned construction, all work must be done according to plan. In strengthening planned management in various factories, management cadres and trade union cadres must have a clear understanding, not only be familiar with all aspects of production, but also be familiar with the ideological and living conditions of the staff and workers, so that planned management work can be continuously improved. On the one hand, trade union cadres at all levels must absorb the opinions of staff and workers and assist the administration in formulating comprehensive management rules that are beneficial to production; on the other hand, they must also educate staff and workers on labor discipline, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and make it a regular task. Chen Shaomin also instructed trade union cadres at all levels to educate the masses of staff and workers to strengthen the concept of the worker-peasant alliance, and gradually improve their own lives on the basis of improving the lives of the people throughout the country.

    Finally, Tang Guifen delivered the closing speech. After summarizing the achievements of the congress, she called on all textile workers to conscientiously implement the resolutions of the congress and strive to complete the Five-Year Construction Plan, realize national industrialization, and gradually transition to a socialist society.

    In the solemn sound of "The Internationale," all the representatives stood in silence. At this point, the Second National Congress of the China Textile Trade Union successfully concluded.

    中国纺织工会第二次全国代表大会闭幕
    陈少敏等五十五人当选为第二届全国委员会委员
    中国纺织工会第二次全国代表大会经过六天会议，在十日胜利闭幕。
    在这次大会上，代表们听取、讨论和通过了陈少敏所作“三年来中国纺织工会工作的基本总结和今后任务”的报告，听取了中央人民政府纺织工业部副部长陈维稷所作纺织工业部的工作报告。代表们还通过了“关于组织问题的几项决定”，取消中国纺织工会第一次全国代表大会所通过的中国纺织工会章程，坚决执行中华人民共和国工会章程。
    当大会通过向毛主席致敬电、向中国人民志愿军致敬电时，全体起立，鼓掌欢呼。大会并通过了向纺织、服装工会国际的致敬信。
    大会第六日，代表们选出陈少敏等五十五人为中国纺织工会第二届全国委员会委员；选出闵淑芬、王淑美等十六人为中国纺织工会第二届全国委员会候补委员；选出王华生、龚辉等七人为中国纺织工会第二届全国经费审查委员会委员。中央人民政府纺织工业部、中国纺织工会全国委员会在大会上举行了授奖仪式。一百零六位纺织工业劳动模范和二十四个模范单位的全体职工得到荣誉奖和物质奖。接着，陈少敏作总结报告。他说：在国家第一个五年计划时期，纺织系统中全体职工奋斗的总目标是：提高机器效率、提高设备利用率，按着国家计划要求，保证完成国家所规定的各项任务。为此，必须切实地总结及推广先进经验，提高工人技术水平和熟练程度，改善劳动条件，改进企业管理，以增加生产，提高质量，降低成本，满足人民日益增长的衣着需要，积累资金，为今后的发展打下良好基础。目前则是提高质量，改善品种，降低成本，保证完成今年的生产计划。陈少敏具体分析了目前纺织生产的情况后，指出大部分工厂的机器效率还没有充分发挥。他指示纺织工会各级组织亟需加强经济核算观念，组织纺织职工算细账、挖潜力，把私营、公私合营、地方国营和少数较差的国营厂的生产水平提高到先进厂的水平。提高机器效率不是单纯增加机器转数，必须从政治、技术和企业管理等方面加强领导，在全面工作提高的基础上稳步前进，逐步提高，反对保守，也反对冒进。接着陈少敏强调指出：在国家进入有计划建设时期，一切工作都要按计划办事。各厂在加强计划管理中，管理干部和工会干部必须心中有数，不仅要熟悉生产中的一切情况，并且要熟悉工作人员的思想、生活状况，使计划管理工作不断改善。各级工会干部一方面要吸收职工的意见，协助行政制订全面的、对生产有利的管理规则；另一方面还必须对职工进行劳动纪律的教育，展开批评和自我批评，并使其成为经常性的工作。陈少敏还指示各级工会干部必须教育职工群众加强工农联盟思想，在全国人民生活增进的基础上，逐步地改善自己的生活。
    最后，汤桂芬致闭幕词。她总结了大会的成就后，号召全体纺织职工认真贯彻大会决议，为完成五年建设计划，实现国家工业化及逐步过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。
    在庄严的“国际歌”声中，全体代表肃立。至此，中国纺织工会第二次全国代表大会胜利闭幕。
