    Returned POWs of the Chinese People's Volunteers Expose:
    The U.S. Side Actually Detained a Group of Our Captured Personnel Who Should Have Been Directly Repatriated
    The U.S. Side Continues to Support the Chiang Kai-shek Gang in Interfering with the Implementation of the Armistice Agreement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th] Returned prisoners of war from the Chinese People's Volunteers said that at least 129 or more Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war are being secretly detained by the U.S. side and have not yet been repatriated. These 129 people were all listed under direct repatriation, firmly demanded repatriation, and refused the illegal "screening" of Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war, most of whom were seized and detained by the U.S. side from prisoner of war camps after an agreement was reached on the prisoner of war issue.
    From July 22nd to 23rd, the U.S. side, on the pretext of "incorrect names and unclear prisoner numbers," successively seized 102 people from Prisoner of War Camp No. 8 on Jeju Island. However, all prisoners of war knew that the names and numbers of these 102 people had been checked countless times. Later, after repeated questioning by our captured personnel in Prisoner of War Camp No. 8, the U.S. side actually said: "They cannot be repatriated in the same way as you." We now have the complete list of the above-mentioned 102 people.
    On June 30th, the U.S. side also seized 14 people, including Li Chunfang, Ma Dezheng, and Li Meisuo, from the No. 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9 wire fence enclosures in Prisoner of War Camp No. 8 on Jeju Island, isolating them from other captured personnel and detaining them separately in a small warehouse 100 meters away from the prisoner of war camp. On July 28th, when a group of our captured personnel left the prisoner of war camp to return, they still saw them.
    In the special prison of the so-called "Security Reception Center" about 500 meters outside Prisoner of War Camp No. 8 on Jeju Island, there are also imprisoned Wang Fang, Wei Lin, Du Ziming, Li Yan, Li Decai and other twelve captured officers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, all of whom insisted on returning to the motherland and opposed illegal "screening" despite all kinds of brutal persecution.
    According to the list of our captured personnel forwarded by the International Committee of the Red Cross, there is an officer named Wu Chengde, whose prisoner number is 719663, who has been held in solitary confinement in Busan since he was captured in the autumn of 1951.
    The above-mentioned 129 people are the initial list learned of here. According to what the returning captured personnel of our side know, there are still many captured personnel of our side being secretly detained. For example, Sun Zhenguan (prisoner number 700101), the first Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war listed on the enemy's prisoner of war list handed over to us, served as a representative many times in the struggle of our captured personnel in Prisoner of War Camp 602 on Geoje Island against the U.S. massacre atrocities and illegal "screening," and negotiated with the U.S. authorities. In the Dodd incident in May 1952, he was the deputy head of the delegation elected by the Korean and Chinese captured personnel. However, after Dodd was released, the U.S. side broke all their promises and arrested all the representatives elected by the Korean and Chinese captured personnel. After repeated protests by our captured personnel, only two were released. The other representatives, including Sun Zhenguan, have been missing ever since.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th] It is learned here that the U.S. side is continuing to support, assist, and utilize the Kuomintang bandit gang to carry out its evil conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Chen Jianzhong, the head of the Kuomintang bandit gang's secret agents sent to South Korea, is now instigating Kuomintang secret agents in the prisoner of war camp on Jeju Island, where Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war are detained, to carry out large-scale activities. One of their conspiracies is to attempt to refuse to hand over the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. If this conspiracy fails, they will create conflicts with the Indian troops guarding the prisoners of war. In order to further implement a reign of terror against the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war and suppress their desire for repatriation, the Kuomintang secret agents in the Moseulpo prisoner of war camp on Jeju Island, under the command of Chen Jianzhong, have arrested a group of prisoners of war who insist on demanding repatriation, preparing to kill them when the prisoners of war are handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and some of them have already been killed. Regarding the directly repatriated prisoners of war, the Kuomintang bandit gang, under the instigation of the U.S. side, has been repeating the so-called "screening" since August 3rd, attempting to forcibly detain more of our prisoners of war. At the same time, the Kuomintang bandit gang's pseudo-Ministry of National Defense is also attempting to send more secret agents to Jeju Island in order to intensify its control over the prisoners of war and obstruct the implementation of the armistice agreement. All these activities of the Kuomintang bandit gang are supported by the U.S. prisoner of war camp authorities.
    An authoritative person here pointed out that Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, the chief member of our side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, has already issued a statement on August 10th, strongly protesting the U.S. support, assistance, and use of the Kuomintang bandit gang's conspiracy to interfere with the implementation of the armistice agreement and forcibly detain prisoners of war. The U.S. side must now immediately take effective measures to expel all Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee bandit gang secret agents who have infiltrated the prisoner of war camps, earnestly abide by all the provisions of the armistice agreement and all the guarantees made by the U.S. side to our side before the armistice, so that our non-directly repatriated prisoners of war can be transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission without obstruction and can freely exercise their right to demand repatriation.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 12th] The U.S. side's violation of the armistice agreement and intensified use of Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang secret agents to carry out evil activities in prisoner of war camps has been further confirmed by the Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war who returned recently.
    Cheng Fuming and Zhang Zifang, the volunteer soldiers who returned on the 10th, were originally detained in the U.S. Busan Seventh Wounded and Sick Prisoner of War Recuperation Center. On August 7th, they heard the black loudspeaker installed on the telephone pole, which consistently spread reactionary remarks, suddenly broadcast a recording of Chiang Kai-shek himself speaking in his Zhejiang accent. In this absurd and shameless speech, Chiang Kai-shek threatened the prisoners of war, saying that several thousand of the volunteer wounded and sick prisoners of war who had been repatriated in April had been executed (note: the total number of volunteer wounded and sick prisoners of war repatriated in April and May was only one thousand and thirty), and told them to "go to Taiwan to participate in the counterattack against the mainland." This act of the U.S. side, which damaged the dignity of the prisoners of war, immediately aroused great anger among the Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war. They scolded "Don't listen to the rabid barking of a stray dog" and expressed strong protests, but the U.S. personnel in the prisoner of war camp threatened them by saying "If you don't listen carefully, you won't get food."
    At the same time, Cheng Fuming also saw U.S. armed personnel distributing leaflets printed with portraits of Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang party emblem to our captured personnel. They raised their thumbs and said to the prisoners of war, "Chiang Kai-shek is the best, Taiwan is the best." Under this blatant connivance and direct participation by the U.S. side, Chiang Kai-shek secret agents also openly told the prisoners of war that they were sent from Taiwan to "comfort" them.
    The returning Chinese People's Volunteer prisoners of war unanimously stated: The U.S. side's intensified carrying out of various evil activities in prisoner of war camps by using Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang secret agents after the start of prisoner repatriation is absolutely intolerable! We demand an immediate end to all conspiratorial activities that violate the armistice agreement!

    归来的志愿军被俘人员揭露
    美方竟拘禁一批应直接遣返的我被俘人员
    美方继续支持蒋匪干涉停战协定之实施
    【新华社开城十二日电】归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员说，至少还有一百二十九名以上的中国人民志愿军被俘人员在美方秘密拘禁下，迄今未被遣返。这一百二十九个人都是列在直接遣返项下、坚决要求遣返、拒绝非法“甄别”的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，其中绝大部分人是在战俘问题达成协议以后被美方从战俘营中抓去拘禁起来的。
    七月二十二日至二十三日，美方藉口“姓名不对、俘号不清”，自济州岛第八号战俘营内先后抓走了一百零二个人。但所有的战俘都知道，这一百零二个人的姓名、编号都是经过无数次清查的。后来，在第八号战俘营的我方被俘人员再三质问下，美方竟说：“他们不能和你们同样地被遣返。”我方现已握有上述一百零二人的全部名单。
    在六月三十日，美方也曾自济州岛第八号战俘营第一、二、四、六、九等号铁丝网围场内抓走了李春方、马德正、李眉锁等十四个人，把他们和其他被俘人员隔离起来，单独拘禁在距战俘营一百公尺的一个小仓库里。七月二十八日一批我方被俘人员离开战俘营归来时还看到他们。
    在济州岛第八号战俘营外约五百公尺处的所谓“保安收容所”的特种监牢里，还囚禁着王芳、魏林、杜资明、李彦、李德才等十二名被俘的中国人民志愿军军官，他们也都是不顾种种残暴的迫害坚持要求返回祖国和反对非法“甄别”的。
    另据红十字国际委员会转来的我方被俘人员名单，有一位名叫吴成德的军官，俘号是七一九六六三，自一九五一年秋天被俘以后，始终单独拘禁在釜山。
    上述一百二十九人是此间获悉的最初步的名单，据归来的我方被俘人员所知，还有不少的我方被俘人员被秘密地拘禁着。如列在对方交给我方的战俘名单上的第一名志愿军被俘人员孙振冠（俘号七零零一零一），在巨济岛六零二战俘营的我方被俘人员抗议美方屠杀暴行和非法“甄别”的斗争中，曾多次充当代表，与美方当局交涉。在一九五二年五月的杜德事件中，他是朝中被俘人员推举出来的代表团的副团长。但杜德被释放以后，美方即背弃了他们的一切诺言，将朝中被俘人员推举出来的代表全部抓起来，经我方被俘人员再三抗议才放回两名，其他的代表，包括孙振冠在内，就一直不知下落。
    【新华社开城十一日电】据此间获悉：美方正在继续支持、协助并利用国民党匪帮进行强迫扣留战俘的罪恶阴谋。国民党匪帮派去南朝鲜的特务头子陈建中，现在正在策动济州岛拘留中国人民志愿军被俘人员的战俘营中的国民党特务分子大肆活动。他们的阴谋之一是企图拒绝将不直接遣返的战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会，如果这一阴谋失败，他们就将制造对看守战俘的印度军队的冲突事件。为了进一步对不直接遣返的战俘实行恐怖统治，压制他们要求遣返的愿望，济州岛摹瑟浦战俘营中的国民党特务分子，在陈建中指挥之下，已经逮捕了一批坚持要求遣返的战俘，准备在战俘被移交给中立国遣返委员会时加以杀害，其中一部分并且已经遭到杀害。对于直接遣返的战俘，国民党匪帮在美方指使下还自八月三日起重复进行所谓“甄别”，企图强行扣留更多的我方战俘。同时，国民党匪帮的伪国防部并企图派遣更多的特务分子前往济州岛，以便加紧控制战俘，阻挠停战协定的实施。国民党匪帮的所有这些活动，都得到美方战俘营当局的支持。
    此间权威人士指出，朝鲜军事停战委员会我方首席委员李相朝中将已经在八月十日发表声明，强硬抗议美方支持、协助和利用国民党匪帮这种干涉停战协定之实施并强迫扣留战俘的阴谋活动。美方现在必须立即采取有效措施，将混入战俘营的一切国民党和李承晚匪帮特务分子逐出战俘营，切实遵守停战协定的一切条款和美方在停战以前向我方所作的全部保证，使不直接遣返的我方战俘能不受阻挠地被移交给中立国遣返委员会并能自由地行使他们要求遣返的权利。
    【新华社开城十二日电】美方违反停战协定，加紧利用蒋介石匪帮特务在战俘营中进行罪恶活动，已在近日归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员中得到进一步证实。
    十日归来的志愿军被俘人员程福明、张子芳原被拘禁在美方釜山第七伤病战俘休养所。八月七日，他们听到那个装在电线杆上一贯传播反动言论的黑色喇叭筒突然传出了蒋介石匪首本人浙江口音的讲话录音。蒋匪在这荒诞无耻的讲话中，恐吓战俘们说四月间遣返回来的志愿军伤病被俘人员已有几千人被处死（按：四、五月份遣返的志愿军伤病被俘人员总共只有一千零三十人），叫他们“到台湾去，参加反攻大陆”。美方这种损害战俘尊严的行为立即激起志愿军被俘人员的极大愤怒，他们纷纷痛骂“不听丧家狗的乱叫”，并表示强硬抗议，但战俘营中的美方人员反而以“不好好听就不发口粮”来威胁他们。
    与此同时，程福明还看到美军武装人员向我方被俘人员散发印有蒋介石匪首像片和国民党党徽的传单，他们翘起姆指向战俘们说“蒋介石顶好，台湾顶好”。在美方这种露骨的纵容和直接参与下，蒋匪特务分子也公然向战俘们表示，他们是台湾派来“慰问”的。
    归来的志愿军被俘人员一致表示：遣俘开始后美方利用蒋介石匪帮特务分子在战俘营中加紧进行种种罪恶活动，是绝对不能容忍的，我们要求立即停止一切违反停战协定的阴谋活动！
