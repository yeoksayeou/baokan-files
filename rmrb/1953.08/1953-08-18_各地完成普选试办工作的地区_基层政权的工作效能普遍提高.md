In areas across the country where pilot work for grassroots elections has been completed, the role of the great universal suffrage movement in further consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship has become evident. In these areas, the work efficiency of grassroots governments has generally improved, and the work style of village and township cadres has also improved significantly.

People's representatives democratically elected by the masses are now performing the glorious tasks entrusted to them by the masses with great enthusiasm. First, they earnestly discussed the current central tasks at the first People's Congress after the universal suffrage. In Sichuan Province, more than 130 townships that had completed grassroots elections held their first township People's Congresses, where they focused on discussing the urgent issues in the current production work of the township based on the opinions of the masses, and made resolutions. An'de Township in Chongning County, based on the specific conditions of the township, made a resolution to make flood prevention, pest control, and pig disease prevention the central tasks of the township. Yu'feng Township in Suining County, based on the urgent need of the people of the township to fight drought, resolved to take drought resistance as the central task. At the first session of the People's Congress in the East District of Hefei City, Anhui Province, the representatives held a heated discussion on the work report of the district people's government for the first half of the year, and listened to the suggestions of the district party committee on future work; the representatives also submitted 136 proposals to the congress related to urban construction, street sanitation, and strengthening the leadership of handicraft production. After full discussion, the congress formulated various resolutions for the current work.

Because the resolutions formulated by the People's Congress conformed to the vital interests of the broad masses of the people, the masses and cadres in various places have actively taken action to earnestly implement the resolutions. After An'de Township in Chongning County, Sichuan Province, conveyed the resolutions on flood prevention, pest control, and pig disease prevention to various villages, a flood prevention team of more than 1,300 people was quickly established. They actively repaired the dangerous sections of the rivers and weirs in the township, so that the rice seedlings in the township were not damaged when the river water rose. The farmers of Quanfu Village in the township, under the leadership of People's Representative Zhou Sanyu and others, uprooted more than 300 jin of rice seedlings with rice borers and scrubbed more than 120 pigsties in three days. Under the leadership of the new township people's government, the farmers of Guantuo Township in Feixi County, Anhui Province, have been mobilized to strive to overfulfill this year's agricultural production plan. The township has completed the emergency planting of 2,368 mu of dry land that had not been planted due to drought, cotton has generally been hoed five or six times, and other dry land grain crops have also been hoed two or three times.

Grassroots government organizations in various places have been reorganized after the universal suffrage, and the previous chaotic phenomenon of "too many" has gradually been overcome. For example, after the new township people's government of Gongnong Township in Neijiang County, Sichuan Province, was established, it abolished or merged the original dozens of institutions and reorganized them into five working committees. At the same time, the 45 people's representatives elected by the township also formed representative groups with villages as units, and worked with the township committee members living in the village to promote the work of the village, and no longer set up various organizations in the village. Because the grassroots government organizations have been simplified, cadres can rationally divide their work and change the previous "all-in-one" leadership method, so the phenomenon of cadres holding too many concurrent positions has also been changed. For example, Gong Liehui, the deputy head of Gongnong Township, served as the township head before the universal suffrage, and also held nine positions concurrently; now he only serves as the deputy head of the township and the director of the market town management committee.

After the profound education of the universal suffrage, the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres in various places has generally increased, and their work style has also improved significantly. Many village and township cadres personally go deep into the masses to lead production and are able to consult with the masses on matters, so the relationship between cadres and the masses has been further strengthened. In Xudun Township, District One, Jian'ou County, Fujian Province, the newly elected cadres earnestly implement the resolutions of the People's Congress. Township cadres often go to the villages to lead production and help the masses solve difficulties. The township was short of food in the summer, and the cadres mobilized the masses to plant sweet potatoes, run transportation, and weave straw hats to exchange for food, while quickly distributing interest-free loans and relief funds allocated by the county, so that the summer food shortage problem in the township was basically solved. In Lishan District, Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, many women who were elected as people's representatives and township cadres have demonstrated their enthusiasm for serving the people and their ability to manage government work. Sun Huiying, the newly elected female deputy head of Zhuanfang Township, Zhuanfang Village, used persuasive education methods to fairly and reasonably resolve a land dispute that had been entangled for many years after she started working. Wang Julan, the newly elected people's representative of Jiaojia Village, in order to implement the resolution of the township People's Congress on completing the payment of patriotic public grain in a timely manner, she and the women activists in the village first transported the public grain they should pay to the state warehouse by pushcart, thus driving the 72 farmers in the village to quickly pay off most of the more than 16,000 jin of public grain.

Due to the change in the work style of village and township cadres, the work efficiency of grassroots governments has rapidly improved. The newly elected cadres of Shuanglong Township in Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, are able to think for the masses whenever they do a job, and do not easily convene mass meetings. For small matters, they send them to the door. Song Dongsheng, a people's representative of Shengquan Village in the township, broke the old rules in the summer tax collection of public grain, and distributed the receipts to each group for distribution to households, reducing the trouble for the masses. Recently, the subsidies issued by the people's government to the families of revolutionary soldiers in the township were quickly distributed to the military families in less than a day. Ren Liangsheng, the clerk of the township people's government of Shijie Township in Pingchang County, Sichuan Province, used to be relatively sluggish in his work, and it often took several days to make a simple roster. After he was elected as a people's representative this time, he made a roster of the revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary military families in the township in one night and sent it to the district, so that the families of martyrs and military families in the township received the government relief funds in time.

    各地完成普选试办工作的地区
    基层政权的工作效能普遍提高
    伟大的普选运动对于进一步巩固人民民主专政的作用，已从全国各地完成基层选举试办工作的地区中显示出来。在这些地区，基层政权的工作效能已普遍提高，乡村干部的工作作风也有不少的改进。
    各地由人民群众民主选举产生的人民代表，目前正以高度的热情去执行群众交给他们的光荣任务。他们首先在普选后第一次人民代表大会上，认真地讨论了当前的中心工作。四川省一百三十多个完成基层选举的乡，都召开了第一次乡人民代表大会，会上根据群众意见，着重讨论了本乡当前生产工作中的迫切问题，并作出了决议。崇宁县安德乡针对本乡的具体情况，作出了以防洪、防虫、防猪病为全乡当前中心工作的决议。遂宁县玉峰乡根据全乡人民抗旱的迫切要求，议决以抗旱为中心工作。安徽省合肥市东市区首届人民代表大会上，代表们对该区人民政府今年上半年的工作报告进行了热烈讨论，并听取了中共区委对今后工作的建议；代表们还向大会提出了一百三十六件有关城市建设、街道卫生和加强对手工业生产领导的提案。大会经过充分讨论，制订了当前工作的各项决议。
    由于人民代表大会制订的决议符合于广大人民的切身利益，因此，各地群众和干部都积极行动起来，认真贯彻决议。四川省崇宁县安德乡将防洪、防虫、防猪病的决议传达到各村后，一个包括一千三百多人的防洪大队很快成立起来，他们积极抢修了该乡各河、堰的险口，使河水上涨时全乡稻禾未受损失。该乡全福村的农民在人民代表周三玉等领导下，三天内就拔除了有螟虫的秧苗共三百余斤，洗刷了猪圈一百二十多个。安徽省肥西县馆铎乡，在新的乡人民政府领导下，全乡农民已经动员起来，为着超额完成今年的农业生产计划而努力。全乡已把因天旱没有种上的二千三百六十八亩旱田抢种完毕，棉花一般都锄了五、六遍，其他旱地的粮食作物也都锄了两三遍。
    各地基层政权组织，在普选后都经过整顿，逐渐克服了以前的“五多”混乱现象。例如四川省内江县工农乡新的乡人民政府成立后，就撤销或合并了原有的数十个机构，改设为五个工作委员会。同时，全乡选出的四十五名人民代表，也以村为单位组成代表小组，与住在本村的乡委员协同推动全村工作，村上则不再设立各种组织。由于基层政权组织简化了，干部就能合理分工，改变了过去“一揽子”的领导方法，因而干部兼职过多的现象也得到改变。如工农乡副乡长龚烈挥，普选前任乡长，还兼任了九项职务；现在只担任副乡长和场镇管理委员会主任两项职务了。
    各地基层干部经过普选的深刻教育，工作积极性普遍提高，工作作风也有了不少改进。许多乡村干部亲自深入群众，领导生产，有事能和群众商量，因而干部和群众的关系已进一步密切。福建省建瓯县一区徐墩乡，新当选的干部认真执行人民代表大会的决议，乡干部经常下村领导生产，帮助群众解决困难。该乡夏荒缺粮，干部们一面动员群众种甘薯、跑运输、编草帽去换取口粮，一面迅速发放县上拨来的无利贷粮和救济款，使全乡夏荒口粮问题基本上得到解决。陕西省临潼县骊山区有许多被选为人民代表和乡干部的妇女，她们都表现了为人民服务的积极性和管理政权工作的能力。砖房乡砖房村新选的女副乡长孙惠英开始工作后，便用说服教育的办法，公平合理地解决了一件纠缠多年的地畔纠纷。焦家村新选的人民代表王菊莲，为了执行乡人民代表大会关于及时完成缴纳爱国公粮的决议案，她和本村的妇女积极分子，首先把自己应缴的公粮用推车送到国家仓库，因而带动了全村七十二户农民很快把一万六千多斤公粮大部缴清。
    由于乡村干部工作作风的转变，使基层政权的工作效能迅速提高。四川省江津县双龙乡新选出的干部，每逢做一件工作，都能够替群众着想，轻易不召集群众大会，小事情就送上门去。该乡圣泉村人民代表宋冬升，在夏征公粮中，打破了以往的老规矩，把收条交各组转发到户，减少了群众的麻烦。最近，人民政府发给该乡革命军人家属的补助金，不到一天，就迅速发到军属们的手里。四川省平昌县石阶乡乡人民政府文书任良升，以前工作比较疲沓，造个简单的花名册，往往也要拖好几天，这次他当选为人民代表后，在一个晚上就把全乡的革命烈士、革命军人家属花名册造好送到区上，使该乡的烈属、军属及时领到了政府的救济款。         （新华社）
