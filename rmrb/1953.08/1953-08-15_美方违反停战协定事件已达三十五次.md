Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 13th: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 13th, our side's chief delegate, General Li Xiangchao, raised another incident of the U.S. side violating the agreement, demanding the U.S. side pay attention. On the 10th, U.S. personnel violated the agreement between the two sides regarding the prohibition of carrying automatic weapons into the demilitarized zone, carrying two semi-automatic rifles into the demilitarized zone. Up to now, the U.S. side has violated the armistice agreement as many as thirty-five times.

At the same meeting on the same day, the U.S. side's chief delegate, Brigadier General Bryan, refused to acknowledge six incidents of the U.S. side violating the armistice agreement. Regarding the violations of the armistice agreement by the U.S. side firing machine guns and artillery at our positions four times between 22:00 on July 27th and 00:00 on July 28th, Bryan, disregarding the conclusive evidence presented by our side, merely stated that no artillery fire was launched in the aforementioned area, flatly denying it. Bryan similarly refused to acknowledge the incidents of U.S. military aircraft violating the armistice agreement by intruding into our airspace near Kaesong twice on August 3rd.

General Li Xiangchao also notified the U.S. side at the meeting that there are a total of 2,586 civilians residing in our side's demilitarized zone north of the military demarcation line. In order to avoid difficulties in the lives of all civilians residing in the demilitarized zone, General Li Xiangchao proposed that the staff officers of both sides discuss and propose specific measures to grant approval at once for the freedom of movement within the demilitarized zone for all civilians residing within the demilitarized zone in the future.

The staff officers of both sides reached an agreement on measures to remove dangerous objects from the demilitarized zone on the 13th, which will take effect upon approval by the Military Armistice Commission.

    美方违反停战协定事件已达三十五次
    【新华社开城十三日电】军事停战委员会十三日会议上，我方首席委员李相朝将军提出美方又一次违反协议的事件，要求美方注意。美方人员在十日违反双方关于禁止携带自动武器进入非军事区的协议，携带两支半自动步枪进入非军事区。到现在为止，美方违反停战协定的事件，已达三十五次之多。
    在同一天会议上，美方首席委员勃里安对美方六次违反停战协定的事件拒不承认。对于在七月二十七日二十二时到二十八日零时之间，美方四次以机枪、大炮向我方阵地射击的违反停战协定事件，勃里安不顾我方提出的确凿证据，仅说上述地区并未发射炮火，予以矢口否认。勃里安对于美国军用飞机在八月三日违反停战协定两次侵入开城附近我方上空的事件也同样拒不承认。
    李相朝将军在会上并通知美方，居住在军事分界线以北我方非军事区的平民，共有二千五百八十六人。为了免除所有居住在非军事区内的平民的生活发生困难，李相朝将军提议由双方参谋人员讨论后提出具体办法，对于所有居住在非军事区内的平民今后在非军事区移动的自由一次予以批准。
    双方参谋人员十三日就从非军事区内清除危险物的措施达成协议，一俟军事停战委员会批准后即行生效。
