Party Life

    Sanhe Village in Chengde County Reorganizes and Improves Propaganda Network Work
    Propaganda Department Working Group of the Rehe Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    In the past, the propaganda network work in Sanhe Village was plagued with formalism. Of the 28 propagandists in the village, 15 were students and teachers who did not participate in production. They could not integrate propaganda with production. Most of the remaining propagandists were cadres who did not pay much attention to propaganda work either. As a result, propaganda work almost ground to a halt. For example, the village's four blackboards were left unattended for extended periods; one blackboard in Dalanwo, even when the land was almost entirely planted after a rain, still displayed the old message "Fight drought and preserve moisture, prepare for spring plowing"; some blackboards were weathered by wind and rain, rendering the words illegible. Oral propaganda work was delegated to a group of children, and the masses paid no attention to it at all; even when propagandists delivered oral propaganda themselves, they often read from prepared texts in a generalized manner, failing to inspire the masses. Furthermore, the propagandists themselves sometimes lacked a clear understanding of the content they were propagating, resulting in little effect after the propaganda. For example, when mobilizing the masses to buy ammonium sulfate (chemical fertilizer) this spring, the masses said that ammonium sulfate was ineffective, and the propagandists were at a loss for words, unable to persuade the masses with scientific reasoning and examples of increased grain production in the village through the use of ammonium sulfate. The reasons for the above-mentioned problems in propaganda work were primarily due to the insufficient attention paid to propaganda network work by the district committee, the lack of a consistent working system, and the failure to promptly improve the policy and ideological level of the propagandists and increase their knowledge of production technology. At the same time, the leadership of the Party branch was also infrequent, only calling upon the propagandists for a brief period when needed, and being content with the status quo, failing to study and improve the work.
    
    Propaganda Organization Reorganized in Combination with Production
    After understanding these situations during this year’s spring planting season, we studied methods of reorganization to bring out the role of propagandists and meet the needs of production tasks. In addition to educating and improving the original propagandists and persuading some primary school students who did not understand production to withdraw from the propaganda network organization, we also selected some activists from the mutual aid teams as Party propagandists and established a system of division of labor and contracting responsibilities for propagandists, with designated personnel responsible for blackboards to strengthen production propaganda; and a singing team was also set up to utilize the role of literary and artistic propaganda. Now, each mutual aid team has one to two propagandists who can conduct propaganda in specific areas in combination with production. Propagandists check on each other after propaganda. Yang Fengde, the deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, is responsible for the blackboard, and two other propagandists with a certain level of education are responsible for regularly supplying materials for the blackboard and broadcasting. The content of the materials should be easy to understand, the fonts should be correct, and the strokes should be clear, and the form should be welcomed by the masses, such as publishing more clapper rhymes and paintings. The singing team is headed by Xie Guilan, the organization member of the Communist Youth League, and uses evenings or production gaps to sing clapper rhymes to the masses. In this way, the propaganda network organization has gradually integrated with production, and the propagandists also feel that they have a way to do things.
    
    Facing Production and Serving Production
    After the rectification, the propaganda network organization changed the past situation, and the propagandists paid attention to carrying out propaganda in connection with each link in production, which promoted production. This year, on May 3, it rained, and some people were reluctant to go to the ground to plant because they felt that the ground was wet (in fact, if they did not rush to plant at that time, there would be a danger of not being able to plant at all). The propagandist Peng Anqing immediately wrote a clapper rhyme about rushing to plant on the blackboard, and also drew a picture reflecting the rush to plant after the rain. Many people went home and harnessed their plows to plant after reading the blackboard. For example, when the masses were beginning to hoe sorghum, some of them still could not get their minds straight and still kept seedlings according to the old method. For example, Chen Zongbo believed that leaving the sorghum one foot two or three inches apart was too dense and there was not enough fertilizer, so the ears would not grow large. The Party branch secretary (propagandist) gave him a detailed account to see how far the roots of the sorghum could be planted, so that he understood the reason that the sorghum was not dense at a distance of one foot and two inches. Later, almost all sorghum in the village was planted at a reasonable density. The singing team used real people and real events to compose and sing clapper rhymes, which played a great role. For example, after the singing team sang a clapper rhyme about the active production of Zhang's old lady, more than 40 women went to work in the fields the next day. When the Jiang Hongfu mutual aid team in the village was preparing for farming, the team won the model red flag. When they were summer hoeing, they were the first to hoe millet. The propagandist wrote a clapper rhyme for them: "Jiang Hongfu team is doing a good job, summer hoeing is even more energetic, the whole team has finished hoeing sorghum, and the seedlings are neatly left, Yang Fengshu's millet is hoeing the first time, planned well, done early, others just can't compare, can't compare." Then many mutual aid teams started hoeing millet, which promoted the summer hoeing work. This year, the cotton seedlings did not come out completely. When the masses were propagandized to plant seedlings, some people thought that "a bowl of rice is not enough to eat"; some were afraid that they would not survive; others were afraid that they would not be able to open peaches even if they survived. The propagandists timely studied the ideological situation of the masses, knowing that this was because the masses did not have enough understanding of the importance of replanting seedlings, and did not understand the effect of the method of replanting seedlings, so they gave everyone a detailed account and introduced the method of replanting seedlings, so that more than 30 acres of cotton fields in the village that were missing seedlings were replanted.
    
    A Few Experiences
    After the propaganda work in Sanhe Village has been reorganized and improved, it can be centered on production and can solve the ideological problems of the masses in a timely manner and encourage the production enthusiasm of the masses. Now I will introduce some experiences as follows:
    First of all, after the branch changed its past work style, it realized the importance of propaganda work, and experienced the effectiveness of propaganda work from actual work. Chu Rongfu, the secretary of the branch, said at the red flag competition meeting in Sanhe, Xiabancheng and other seven villages: "One of the main reasons why many people in our village were able to accept new technologies in spring plowing is that we patiently carried out propaganda and education to the masses." All the party members in the village personally experienced that: "As long as the propaganda is done, the masses' thinking is cleared, and all work is easy to do." After the branch reorganized the propaganda network organization, it can often hold propaganda meetings to collect the ideological situation of the masses, assign tasks to the propagandists, and help the propagandists solve difficult problems. The propagandists are happy and energetic because they have received the specific leadership of the branch.
    
    Secondly, when conducting political and production propaganda to the masses, it is necessary to study the ideological situation of the masses in a timely manner and summarize the production experience of this material, so that the propaganda can truly grasp the thinking of the masses; combine the experience of other places with the local experience to overcome the generalization phenomenon in the content of the propaganda. When the village was promoting rational close planting, some farmers had the idea of "sparse millet has big ears" and "love the seedlings from childhood, hold a gourd when old." The propagandists summarized the examples of Yang Fengen's intensive cultivation and close planting to produce more grain and Luan Fuliang's lack of seedlings and broken rows to produce less grain to conduct technical education to the masses, which was very effective.
    
    Again, judging from the experience of this village, the reorganization and development of the propaganda network organization must be based on the requirements of production development, actively strengthen the education of propagandists, so that they are more suitable for the needs of production tasks. After the village established a division of labor and contracting system for propagandists according to the cooperative, mutual aid team and residential situation, the propagandists reflected: "This method is good, it does not delay production and it does the propaganda work." Because the propagandists continuously conducted propaganda and mobilization to the members of the community and team during the production process, everyone reflected: "It is really energetic to work with them." Small-scale literary and artistic propaganda is very popular among the masses. During the busy farming season of spring plowing and summer hoeing, the propagandists timely compiled many clapper rhymes based on the government's policies, agricultural technology, and real people and real events in the village, and conducted propaganda on the ground and on the streets, which played a great role in promoting production.
    
    Existing Problems and Future Improvement Methods
    (1) When developing propagandists, due to the lack of strict understanding and review, some individuals who are not qualified have also become propagandists, which not only does not play a role among the masses, but also has a bad impact. In order to continuously consolidate and improve the propaganda network organization, individuals who are not qualified should be eliminated, and the leadership and education of those who are not familiar with propaganda work should be strengthened, and propaganda tasks should be assigned to them in a timely manner, regular inspections should be carried out, and difficulties should be solved for them in a timely manner to promote their propaganda work.
    
    (2) Some propagandists still cannot make full use of the opportunity for the masses to rest to conduct patriotic ideological education or to conduct propaganda on current affairs policies and production technology. This should continue to be improved in the future.

### 承德县三合村整理和改进了宣传网工作

    承德县三合村整理和改进了宣传网工作
    中共热河省委宣传部工作组
    过去三合村的宣传网工作是存在着形式主义的。全村二十八名宣传员，其中十五名是不参加生产的学生和教师，他们不能结合生产进行宣传，其余大部分是干部，也不大注意宣传工作，因此宣传工作几乎陷于停滞状态。例如，全村四块黑板报常期没有人编写；大兰窝有一块黑板报在下雨以后，土地快要全部种完的时候，还登载着过去写的“抗旱保墒，准备春耕”的消息；有的被风吹雨淋，字句已经模糊不清。而口头宣传工作则交给一帮小孩子去做，群众根本不注意听；即使宣传员亲自去作口头宣传，也多是照本宣读，一般化，不能鼓动群众。加以宣传员本人有时对宣传的东西也了解不清楚，所以，宣传后收效也不大。如今春开始动员群众买硫?（化学肥料）时，群众说硫?不管用，宣传员也就无言答对，不能以科学道理和本村使用硫?多打粮食的例子去说服群众。宣传工作存在以上问题的原因，主要是由于区委对宣传网工作尚不够重视，没有一定的经常的工作制度，不能及时提高宣传员的政策思想水平和增进他们的生产技术知识。同时，党支部的领导也不经常，只是在用得着时找来宣传一阵，他们满足于现状，不去研究和改进工作。
    结合生产整理了宣传组织
    今春播种期间，我们了解了这些情况后，就研究整理的办法，以发挥宣传员作用，适应生产任务的需要。除对原有宣传员加以教育提高，将一部不懂生产的小学生劝其退出宣传网组织外，又从互助组中挑选一些积极分子为党的宣传员，建立起宣传员的分工包干制度，由专人负责黑板报，加强生产宣传；并设有演唱组，发挥文艺宣传的作用。现在，每个互助组里有一名至两名宣传员能结合生产分片宣传。宣传后由宣传员互相检查。黑板报由团支部副书记杨凤德负责，另有两名有文化程度的宣传员负责经常供给黑板报和广播的材料。材料内容力求通俗易懂，字体要端正，笔画要清楚，形式要做到为群众所欢迎的，如多登些快板和绘画。演唱组由青年团组织委员谢桂兰为组长，利用晚间或生产空隙给群众演唱快板。这样，宣传网组织就逐渐与生产相结合了，宣传员也感到有办法了。
    面向生产，为生产服务
    经过整顿后，宣传网组织改变了过去的情况，宣传员注意结合生产中的每个环节进行宣传，推动了生产。今年五月三日下了雨，有的人嫌地湿，不愿下地播种（实际上当时如不快抢墒播种，即有出不来的危险），宣传员彭安清就马上编了一个快抢墒种地的快板登在黑板报上，还画了一幅反映雨后抢种的画。很多人看了黑板报就回家套了犁杖去种地。又如开始耪高粱时有的群众思想搞不通，仍按老办法留苗，如陈宗波认为高粱留一尺二、三寸太密了，肥料不够，穗子长不大，党支部书记（宣传员）就给他算细账，看楂子根能扎多远，使他明白高粱相距一尺二寸并不密的道理。后来，全村高粱基本上全都做到了合理密植。演唱组采用真人真事编成快板演唱，作用很大。例如有一次演唱组演唱了张老太太生产积极的快板后，第二天就有四十多名妇女下地干活。该村姜洪富互助组在备耕时，小组得了模范红旗，夏锄时他们第一份耪谷子，宣传员就给他们编了快板：“姜洪富组搞得好，夏锄开始更起劲了，全组高粱都耪完，小苗留的真齐全，杨凤树的谷子耪头遍，计划好，做的早，别人就是比不了，比不了。”接着很多互助组都起来耪谷子了，推动了夏锄工作。今年棉苗出的不全，向群众宣传栽苗时，有的认为“碗边饭吃不饱”；有的怕栽不活；还有的怕栽活了也不能开桃。宣传员就及时地研究了群众的这种思想情况，知道这是群众对补苗的重要性认识不足，不明白补苗办法的效果，于是就给大家算细账，介绍补苗办法，这样便使全村三十多亩缺苗的棉田得到补苗了。
    几点体会
    三合村的宣传工作经过整理和改进后，就能够以生产为中心并能及时地解决群众思想问题和鼓动群众的生产热情了。现将几点经验介绍如下：
    首先是支部在转变了过去的工作作风之后，认识了宣传工作的重要，并从实际工作中体验了宣传工作的效用。支部书记楚荣福在三合、下板城等七个村红旗评比会上说：“我村很多群众能够在春耕中接受新技术的主要原因之一是我们耐心地向群众进行了宣传教育。”全村党员都亲身体验到：“只要宣传做到了，群众思想打通了，什么工作都好干。”支部在整理了宣传网组织后，能经常召开宣传员会议，搜集群众思想情况，向宣传员布置任务，并帮助宣传员解决困难问题。宣传员因为得到了支部具体领导而感到高兴和起劲。
    其次，在向群众进行政治和生产宣传时，必须及时研究群众思想情况，和总结本材生产经验，使宣传能真正抓住群众思想；外地与本地经验相结合，以克服宣传内容上的一般化现象。该村在宣传合理密植时，有的农民存在着“稀谷莠大穗”、“从小爱苗，老了抱瓢”的思想。宣传员便总结了杨凤恩精耕密植多打粮和栾福良缺苗断条少打粮的实例，向群众进行技术教育，收效很大。
    再次，从这村经验看来，整理和发展宣传网组织必须根据生产发展的要求，积极加强宣传员教育，使之更加适合生产任务的需要。该村按合作社、互助组和居住情况建立了宣传员分工包干制度后，宣传员反映说：“这个办法好，不耽误生产又把宣传工作做了。”由于宣传员在生产过程中不断地向社、组员进行宣传鼓动，所以大家反映说：“和他们在一起干活真有劲。”小型文艺宣传很受群众欢迎，宣传员在春耕夏锄的农忙季节，及时地根据政府的政策、农业技术和本村真人真事编了不少快板，利用地头、街头进行宣传，对生产起了很大推动作用。
    存在的问题和今后改进办法
    （一）在发展宣传员时，由于了解审查的不严密，仍有个别不够条件的也当上了宣传员，在群众中不仅起不了作用，而且还产生不好影响。为了能使宣传网组织不断地巩固和提高，个别不够条件的应予以清除，对于宣传工作不够熟悉的应加强对他们的领导和教育，及时布置给他们宣传任务，定期检查，并及时给他们解决困难，以推动他们的宣传工作。
    （二）有些宣传员还不能充分利用群众休息机会进行爱国主义的思想教育或进行时事政策、生产技术的宣传。今后应该继续加以改进。
