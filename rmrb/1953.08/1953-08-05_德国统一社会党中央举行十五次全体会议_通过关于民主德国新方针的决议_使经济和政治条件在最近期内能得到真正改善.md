Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 4th: The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany held its fifteenth plenary session from July 24th to 26th, and adopted several resolutions on new political policies for the German Democratic Republic.

The resolution first pointed out that the Party advised the government of the German Democratic Republic to adopt new policies in the hope of genuinely improving the economic and political conditions of the German Democratic Republic in the near future, and on this basis, significantly raising the living standards of the working class and all working people. These measures are also for a great national goal: to strengthen the forces of peace and promote the unification of Germany.

The resolution then pointed out that the implementation of this policy has already produced considerable results: workers' wages have been increased, the amount of grain delivered by farmers has been reduced and loans have been obtained, the property of small farmers, rich peasants, and private small industrialists and merchants who had left their farms and businesses has been returned, the issuance of inter-district passports has been relaxed, and due to government measures to increase wages for some lower-income people, increase pensions, reduce retail prices of some food and industrial products, and adjust taxes on handicraftsmen and private enterprises, the purchasing power of the people of the German Democratic Republic will increase by 2 billion marks this year. The resolution pointed out that these measures are the first step taken by the Party and the government to implement the new policy, which will become the Party's long-term political policy, and its purpose is to strengthen the struggle for peace, unity, and prosperity.

The resolution then analyzed the fascist provocation that occurred in Berlin on June 17th, pointing out that this incident was caused by the war-mongers and enemies of German unity becoming furious and panicked by the government's announcement of the new policy, and was also determined by the international situation. The easing of international tensions led the reactionary American group to decide to launch provocations on almost the same day in two different parts of the world (Korea and Berlin). However, the fascists' attempt to create riots on June 17th failed. The majority of the people of the German Democratic Republic, especially the working class, did not support the provocateurs as the fascists had hoped. Only a small number of deceived workers of the Republic participated in the strike. The failure of the June 17th provocation proves that the democratic system of the German Democratic Republic is unshakable because it is supported by the majority of workers.

The resolution also pointed out that the Party must learn from the events of June 17th and overcome the shortcomings existing in the Party's work. At the same time, the events of June 17th caused the rise of anti-democratic forces in the ideological, political, and economic fields. The Party's task is to resolutely oppose the revival of these hostile forces and expose their anti-people essence.

The resolution exposed the anti-state crimes of former Minister of Justice Max Fechner and announced the decision to expel Fechner from the Party Central Committee and expel him from the Party. Under Fechner's instructions, many active organizers of hostile actions, American agents, and ringleaders of provocations were released unconditionally by the judicial organs.

The resolution put forward important tasks that the Party and the state must complete to realize the new policy, and suggested: changing the Five-Year Plan and the 1953 national economic plan in the direction of reducing investment in heavy industry to increase the production of consumer goods. Reduce the originally planned increase of 13 percent in heavy industry production in the 1953 national economic plan to only 5.5 to 6 percent. Increase light industry production to nearly 9 percent instead of the originally planned 7.1 percent. Secondly, investment in steel, mining, machine manufacturing, chemical and building materials industries in 1954 and 1955 will be considerably reduced compared to the figures stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. Investment in the development of power production, coal mining, transportation, and agriculture will not be reduced. Light industry, food industry, grain industry, and construction work should be expanded.

In agriculture, the yield of grain per hectare in 1954 and 1955 will be higher than the figures stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, and livestock numbers should be brought as close as possible to the figures stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. In implementing the new policy in agriculture, it is necessary to encourage and support individual farmers to whom the state has already given considerable assistance. First and foremost, help small and medium farmers.

State and cooperative trade will be further developed. The volume of retail trade should be increased compared to the figures stipulated in the Five-Year Plan to meet the increase in people's purchasing power, and the initiative of private businesses should be brought into play on a broad basis.

The resolution also pointed out that further strengthening the democratic order and strictly enforcing democratic laws are important parts of the new policy. In this regard, the most important task is to bring the entire administrative management structure closer to the masses and establish close ties with them. The resolution emphasized that the purpose of implementing the new policy is also to strengthen the forces of peace and promote German unity. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic should intensify efforts to achieve mutual understanding between the people of East and West Germany; use various methods to strengthen the National Front of Democratic Germany to encourage the great patriotic movement for unity and peace; and spare no effort to promote the unity of working-class action throughout Germany. It calls for the implementation of the resolutions of the Budapest meeting of the World Peace Council on resolving international conflicts and disputes through consultation and understanding.

In the last part of the resolution, it talked about the achievements and mistakes of the Party's policy. It pointed out that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has made significant achievements since its establishment. Based on years of struggle for the unity of the working class, the Party has led the establishment of a new democratic country and a new economic system, and for the first time in the history of the German workers' movement, it has laid a solid foundation for the worker-peasant alliance. The Party has always stood at the forefront of the struggle to safeguard peace. The Party has correctly implemented the policy of rebuilding industry and developing productive forces relying on its own strength. As a result of this policy, industrial production in 1952 reached 157 percent of the pre-war level, and agricultural production in 1952 also exceeded the pre-war harvest volume and exceeded the productivity of West German agriculture and animal husbandry.

In addition to the correct general policy, the Party has also made a series of mistakes in the recent period: the Party adopted the correct policy of building the foundations of socialism in the German Democratic Republic, but adopted incorrect methods. It acted too hastily and did not properly consider the current domestic and international prerequisites, which caused the pace of economic construction to be too rapid (especially in heavy industry), while mistakenly wanting to remove and eliminate the domestic middle and small bourgeoisie and rich peasants. This harmed the supply of materials to residents and, to some extent, hindered the normal relationship between the Party and the working masses.

In the movement to establish agricultural production cooperatives, some local Party organizations violated the strict principle of voluntariness in the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, and did not give the necessary attention to strengthening existing cooperatives organizationally and economically.

The resolution said: The German Democratic Republic is building a new life under conditions of national division, which creates special features and difficulties for reconstruction. The monopoly capital that is in power in West Germany today is engaged in activities deliberately aimed at sabotaging the German Democratic Republic. It receives the support of American imperialism and can fully organize such sabotage in the heart of the German Democratic Republic – Berlin. The fact of German division is a great misfortune for the German people and a threat to peace in Europe, which makes the struggle for the reunification of Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis the Party's main task.

The resolution concluded: "Our Party has entered a new stage in its history. Relying on the invincible doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and closely linked with the powerful Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee, in the firm friendship of the world peace camp, the Party has begun to adopt new policies... The Party is filled with firm determination to implement this new policy regardless of any obstacles."

    德国统一社会党中央举行十五次全体会议
    通过关于民主德国新方针的决议
    使经济和政治条件在最近期内能得到真正改善
    【新华社四日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会于七月二十四日至二十六日举行了第十五次全体会议，通过关于德意志民主共和国新的政治方针的若干决议。
    决议首先指出，党建议德意志民主共和国政府采取新方针的理由，是希望使德意志民主共和国的经济和政治条件在近期内得到真正的改善，并在这一基础上相当地提高工人阶级和全体劳动人民的生活水平。这些措施同时也都是为了一个伟大的民族目标：加强和平力量和促进德国的统一。
    决议接着指出，这一方针实行到现在已经产生了相当大的成果：工人的工资已经增加了，农民所交公粮的数额已经减低并得到贷款，离开了他们的农庄和事业的小农、富农、私营小工商业者的财产已经发还，区际护照的发给已经放宽了，并且由于政府采取措施给收入较低的一部分人增加了工资，增加养老金，减低了一些食品与工业品的零售价格，调整了对手工业者和私人企业的税收，德意志民主共和国人民的购买力在今年将增加二十亿马克。决议指出，这些措施是党与政府实行新政策的第一步，这种政策将成为党的长远的政治方针，它的目的是要加强争取和平、统一与繁荣的斗争。
    决议接着分析了六月十七日在柏林发生的法西斯挑衅事件，指出这一事件是由于政府宣布实行新方针使得战争贩子和德国统一的敌人暴怒和惊慌不止而产生的，同时也是由国际局势所决定的，国际紧张局势的缓和使得美国反动集团决定几乎在同一天在世界的两个不同部分（朝鲜和柏林）发动挑衅。但是，法西斯分子要在六月十七日制造暴动的企图失败了，德意志民主共和国大多数人民、特别是工人阶级并没有如法西斯所期望的去支持挑衅分子，只有少数受了欺骗的共和国的工人参加了罢工。六月十七日挑衅事件的失败证明：德意志民主共和国的民主制度是屹立不可动摇的。因为它得到大多数工人的拥护。
    决议同时指出，党必须从六月十七日的事件中吸取教训，克服党工作中存在的缺点。同时由于六月十七日的事件引起了反民主势力在思想的、政治的和经济的领域中的抬头。党的任务就在于坚决地反对这种敌对力量的复活和揭发他们敌视人民的本质。
    决议揭发了前司法部长马克思·费希纳的反国家罪行，并公布了把费希纳开除出党中央委员会和开除出党的决定。在费希纳的指示下，许多敌对行动的积极组织者、美国特务和挑衅事件的首脑都被司法机关毫无例外地释放了。
    决议提出了党和国家为了实现新方针所必须完成的重要任务，建议：在减少重工业投资以增加消费品生产的方向下改变五年计划和一九五三年国民经济计划。将一九五三年国民经济计划原来所规定的重工业生产增加百分之十三减少为只增加百分之五点五至六。将轻工业生产提高为增加将近百分之九，而不是原计划所规定的百分之七点一。其次，一九五四年和一九五五年对钢、采矿、机器制造、化学和建筑材料工业的投资将比五年计划中所规定的数字相当地减少。对发展动力生产、采煤、交通与农业的投资不减少。轻工业、食品工业、粮食工业和建筑工作要加以扩展。
    在农业方面，一九五四年和一九五五年的每公顷谷物收获量将高于五年计划中所规定的数字，并尽可能使牲畜头数达到五年计划中所规定的数字。在执行农业方面的新方针中，要鼓舞与支持国家已经给予了他们相当帮助的个体农民。首先应帮助小农和中农。
    国家与合作社贸易将要进一步发展。零售贸易量应比五年计划中所规定的数字增加，以适应人民购买力的提高，并应在广泛的基础上使私人商业的主动性得到发挥。
    决议同时指出，进一步加强民主秩序和严格地执行民主法律是新方针的重要部分，在这方面最主要的任务是使整个的行政管理机构与群众更加接近并与他们建立起紧密的联系。决议强调：实行新方针的目的还在于加强和平力量，促进德国统一。德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府要加紧争取东、西德人民之间的互相谅解；要用各种方法来加强民主德国全国阵线以鼓舞争取统一与和平的伟大爱国运动；要不遗余力地在全德促进工人阶级行动的一致。它要求实现世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议关于通过协商和谅解解决国际冲突和争端的决议。
    决议在最后一部分中谈到了党的政策的成就和错误。指出，德国统一社会党自从成立以来已经获得重大成就。党以争取工人阶级统一的多年斗争为基础，领导建立了一个新的民主国家和新的经济制度，并且在德国工人运动史上第一次奠定了工农联盟的坚固基础。党始终站在维护和平的斗争前列。党正确地执行了重建工业和依靠自己的力量发展生产力的政策，由于这个政策，工业生产在一九五二年已经达到战前水平的百分之一百五十七，农业生产一九五二年也超过了战前的收获量，并且超出了西德农业和牧畜业的生产率。
    除了正确的总方针以外，党在最近一个时期也犯了一系列的错误：党采取了在德意志民主共和国建设社会主义基础的正确方针，却采取了错误的方法：它操之过急而没有适当地考虑到目前国内外的先决条件，这就造成经济建设步调过急（特别是在重工业方面），同时错误地想除去和消灭国内的中、小资产阶级和富农。这就损害了对居民的物质供应，并且在某种程度上还妨碍了党和劳动群众的正常关系。
    在成立农业生产合作社的运动中，某些地区的党组织违反了成立农业生产合作社的严格的自愿原则，而对于从组织上和经济上加强现有合作社没有给以必要的注意。
    决议说：德意志民主共和国是在国家分裂的情况下建设新生活的，这就造成重建的特殊性和困难。今天在西德执政的垄断资本从事存心破坏德意志民主共和国的活动。它获得美帝国主义的支持，并且完全可以在德意志民主共和国的心脏——柏林——组织这种破坏活动。德国分裂的事实是德国人民的大不幸，也是欧洲和平的威胁，这就使得争取德国在民主和平的基础上重新统一的斗争成为党的主要任务。
    决议最后说：“我们的党走入了自己历史的新阶段。依靠马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林战无不胜的学说，和强大的苏联共产党及其中央委员会紧密联系，在全世界和平阵营的牢固友谊中，党开始采取新方针……。党充满了坚强的决心，将不顾任何阻碍，去执行这个新的方针。”
