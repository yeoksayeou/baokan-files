Impressions of a Visit to the Soviet Union
Li Furen, Head of the All-China Soviet Friendship Association Delegation

Profound Friendship

The first, and most unforgettable, impression we gained from our visit to the Soviet Union was the profound friendship of the Soviet people for the Chinese people. Every Soviet citizen we encountered, whether it was a ninety-year-old farmer in a collective farm or a child in a factory nursery, showed such love for the Chinese people and welcomed us so warmly. We will never forget the six-year-old children in the Minsk Automobile Factory nursery reciting poems about Shanghai children welcoming May Day. Wherever we went, the responsible comrades put aside their busy work to receive us, guide us on tours, or answer our questions in detail. When we visited the Stalin Metal Factory in Leningrad, the factory was about to hold an important meeting. The director immediately decided to postpone the meeting, saying, "The Chinese delegation is here, and there is no more important work than this." When our ship passed through the Lower Cherskaya Wharf on the Tsimlyansk Sea, crowds of people were already standing on the wharf to welcome us. A female medical worker presented us with flowers on behalf of the group. She said they knew we were passing through from a radio broadcast and came to welcome us on their own initiative.

An even more moving manifestation of the Soviet people's deep friendship for the Chinese people was the unanimous expression by factory directors, engineers, and advanced workers in Soviet factories of their willingness to impart all their knowledge and advanced experience to us without reservation, and their hope that we would send more people to their factories for internships. The Moscow Ordzhonikidze Machine Tool Factory is manufacturing many new types of machine tools for Chinese factories and has already dispatched a group of engineers and technicians to China to help install and teach Chinese workers how to use these new and excellent machines. The director of this factory said that when they received the task of manufacturing machines for Chinese factories and dispatching personnel to help with China's construction, they all unanimously considered it their highest honor and were willing to do everything possible to complete this glorious task faster and better. At the Stalin Metal Factory in Leningrad and the New Tagil Metallurgical Factory in Sverdlovsk Oblast, we met Chinese personnel sent for internships. They unanimously expressed great satisfaction and heartfelt gratitude for the Soviet engineers and advanced workers who imparted their knowledge and experience to them without reservation and with tireless patience.

The Soviet people study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, with boundless admiration. At the farewell banquet in Sverdlovsk, the head of the propaganda department of the Oblast Party Committee told us that the Soviets present all had Russian versions of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and were currently studying them. The Soviet people also love Chinese literature and art. We saw a performance of the Chinese drama "Growing Up in Battle" at the Central Theater of the Soviet Army in Moscow and heard performances of pieces composed by Ma Sicong and He Luting. When we visited a district library in Sverdlovsk, the librarian pulled out a Russian translation of Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River." More than sixty names had already signed the borrowing list, and the number of people who had read this book was certainly greater than that, and there was more than one copy of this book in the library.

The Soviet people love peace and are closely concerned with the victory of the Chinese people's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. At every banquet, they toasted to lasting world peace and to the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front.

The Great Strength of Defending Peace

Every Soviet citizen is working diligently for peace. We saw the green protective forest belts densely covering the Don River prairie, and we also saw the Lenin Volga-Don Canal and the Tsimlyansk Sea. Rivers, lakes, and a vast expanse of 260,000 hectares of water appeared on the arid prairie. The people of the prairie saw seagulls flying in the sky and nightingales singing in the verdant forests, things that their ancestors had never seen before. This was a miracle, a myth, under the old system, but it has become a reality in the socialist Soviet Union.

We saw the brilliant achievements of Soviet industrial technology. The Stalin Metal Factory in Leningrad manufactured a 150,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator, unprecedented in the history of world power, and is now manufacturing 120,000-kilowatt hydroelectric generators for the great communist construction project, the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station. The Ural Heavy Machinery Plant has manufactured a self-propelled excavator with a bucket capacity of 20 cubic meters, which can excavate 38 to 40 tons of soil at a time. We also saw the fully automated New Tagil Metallurgical Factory, where workers can sit in offices like working rooms and control the entire complex production process. Many heavy physical labors are replaced by the thousands and thousands of complex machines designed and manufactured by various factories. These achievements far surpass those of capitalist countries.

While unemployment and hunger are attacking the working class in capitalist countries, Soviet workers are displaying initiative and creativity, full of vigor, and confidently advancing towards communism, with their lives becoming better day by day. Ninety-eight percent of the workers at the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant are Stakhanovite workers, and 42 have won Stalin Prizes, including workers, engineers, and staff members. In the seven years since the war, the state has built excellent housing with an area of over 100,000 square meters for workers at the New Tagil Metallurgical Factory alone, and has also built more than ten cultural palaces, cinemas, nurseries, and schools.

In agriculture, the production process of major crops has been fully mechanized, and technical crops and animal husbandry have been largely mechanized and working with scientific methods, which has greatly improved labor productivity and made farmers' lives more prosperous. Before the revolution, the Sverdlov Collective Farm could only harvest 5 to 6 quintals of grain per hectare, but now it has increased to 18 to 20 quintals. Last year, the remuneration for each work-day at the Dawn Collective Farm was only 8 rubles in cash and 2.6 kilograms of grain, 7 kilograms of potatoes, and 1 kilogram of vegetables. This year, it is planned to increase the cash alone to 20 rubles. Many things that could only be enjoyed in cities in the past, such as electric lights, telephones, movies, and radios, have now become daily necessities for collective farm members.

Everywhere we saw the Soviet people's happy peaceful life and peaceful labor, and at the same time, we saw the great strength of defending peace.

A Big Family of Unity and Friendship Among All Nationalities

The friendly and united relationship among all nationalities in the Soviet Union also moved us deeply. Before the October Revolution, nationalities such as Belarus and Georgia were relatively underdeveloped economically and culturally. However, under the brilliant light of Lenin and Stalin's nationalities policy, all ethnic regions have developed metallurgical and machine-building industries, realized agricultural collectivization, eliminated illiteracy with their own national languages, published Marxist-Leninist classics, and established many universities and colleges to train young cadres and technical personnel of all nationalities. The Minsk Automobile Factory presented us with the complete works of Stalin published in Belarusian as a gift. The Belarus and Georgia Foreign Cultural Associations both gave us collections of Chinese novels translated into their respective languages as souvenirs.

While developing their own national cultures, they also respect Russian culture and the status of the Russian nation in historical development and revolution. The children in their kindergartens can recite poems in their own national languages and can also fluently recite Pushkin's works in Russian. They do not regard Russian as a foreign language, but as their "second national language."

At the Minsk Museum of the Patriotic War, we saw the close cooperation between the Russian nation and other nationalities during the war. A photograph of a guerrilla team showed Russians, Belarusians, and people of other nationalities. From the conversation with the chairman of the Minsk City Soviet, we also learned about the significant assistance given by Russia and other Soviet nationalities to the Belarusian people during the post-war recovery period. He said, "Without the assistance of Russia and other Union republics, it would have been too difficult to restore our city." At every banquet, the leaders of Belarus and Georgia raised their glasses to the Russian nation and to the Russians present.

Educating the People with Revolutionary Historical Sites

The Soviet Party and government attach great importance to the historical sites where the great revolutionary teachers carried out serious revolutionary struggles and use these historical sites to educate the broad masses of people to learn the glorious revolutionary history of the Party. We visited the thatched shed where the great Lenin took refuge when he was persecuted by the reactionary Provisional Government, and the two tree roots near the shed, one high and one low, where Lenin wrote the first draft of "State and Revolution." The tree roots remained intact, and the thatched shed was destroyed long ago. The Party and government restored it according to its original appearance and erected a monument next to it with granite. During the Patriotic War, the government awarded medals to the heroes who defended Leningrad here, and the soldiers swore here to resolutely defend the motherland's land. We visited the small wooden house where the great Stalin was born and the underground printing house in Tbilisi established under Stalin's instructions. The wooden house had long been destroyed, and the printing house had also been bombed by the Tsar's gendarmes, but they have now been restored to their original appearance, and all the furnishings have been restored to their original state. In order to use these historical sites to educate the people, these places have been converted into museums. The cruiser Aurora, whose cannon fire marked the beginning of a new era in human history, is long past its prime, but it has now been built into a museum to educate millions of people with its revolutionary spirit.

Museums are a very important tool for the Soviet Party and government to educate the broad masses of people. In order to enable museums to fulfill their important mission, they must be equipped with very cultured people to serve as narrators. We visited many large and small revolutionary history museums, and each narrator can actually become a Party history teacher with a high level of theoretical cultivation. In addition to explaining to the audience with tireless patience, they also constantly study their own profession, participate in social activities, and guide the Party history learning of cadres and students in organs and schools.

Socialist Urban Construction

The ten or so cities, large and small, that we visited in the Soviet Union made us strongly feel that one of the most fundamental characteristics of Soviet urban construction is to maximize the satisfaction of the people's ever-increasing material and cultural needs. Stalingrad converted the scenic area on the slope of the Volga River, where the station warehouses used to be, into a residential area. The high-rise residential buildings in Minsk's construction plan all have spacious green courtyards, so that the elderly and children can rest without crossing the street. Downstairs, there are small department stores, barber shops, tailor shops, and nurseries, which are necessary facilities for residents' daily lives. Each resident of Rostov enjoys an average of about 7 square meters of public green space, and the 2,100 hectares of forests planted around the city are not included in this calculation. Stalingrad plans to have an average of 12 to 15 square meters of green space for each resident. When we took a car to tour the cityscapes of each city, we only saw parks and fountains everywhere. If we looked from a higher place, the entire city was immersed in lush greenery.

The second characteristic we saw in Soviet urban construction is that the entire city is built under a unified design. In the Minsk City Soviet office, we saw not only the plan view of the entire city's construction plan, but also the design drawings of each street and each building. Each street not only has a unified plan for where to build the trade union office, where the organs are, where to open banks and department stores, where to set up cinemas and clubs, and where to build residences, but also the style of each building is designed in advance. This not only makes work and life very convenient for the working people, but also makes the architecture of the entire city and the entire street very coordinated.

The third characteristic of Soviet urban construction is that they treat the entire city as an art construction project, and each building is a very perfect work of art. This has greatly developed the excellent architectural art traditions of the Soviet nationalities under new historical and new technical conditions. Leningrad, which concentrates the carefully designed work of famous Russian and world architects, goes without saying, but the construction of the cities of Minsk, Stalingrad, and other cities we saw is also very beautiful.

For cities that have been damaged by war, of course, they can be completely rebuilt according to new plans. For old cities that have not suffered war damage, the Soviet government also thoroughly transforms them according to the new requirements of residents' lives. The narrow streets and low houses of ancient Moscow have disappeared. The trade union building with its columned hall, which was the tallest building in the area before the revolution, is now the lowest. This historically significant building was intentionally preserved by the Party and government in its original form.

Another point in Soviet urban construction that is worth learning from is that the broad masses of working people and residents actively participated in urban construction work. There was the famous "Chekasova Movement" in the restoration and reconstruction of Stalingrad, and many boulevards and squares in Minsk were built by the working people's spare-time labor. The working people of Leningrad are building the large-scale "Victory Park" in their spare time.

We saw many things in the Soviet Union, things that amazed us, excited us, and moved us. The Soviet Union is the first homeland of the working people in the world and the most advanced country in the world. It is not only the most advanced in terms of social system, but also far surpasses capitalist countries in terms of science and technology. The culture, art, and moral qualities of the people cannot be compared with those of the increasingly decadent capitalist countries. But they are not satisfied with their existing achievements and are actively working, full of confidence, towards the most beautiful ideal of mankind—a communist society. There are too many things worth learning from them. Chairman Mao has repeatedly called on us to learn from the Soviet Union. From this visit and from practical life, we deeply realized the important significance of "taking Russia as our teacher" in order to build our country. At the same time, what we will always remember is the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. This friendship is so sincere, so selfless, and so deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Every Soviet citizen loves the Chinese people and is constantly concerned about the needs of the Chinese people in building their own country, and is willing to provide us with all the help we need at any time. This is truly a great friendship, and it will encourage us to work even harder and build our country with even greater confidence. We have a deeper understanding that the Soviet people love peace, and they also have the confidence and strength to defend peace. The close unity of the peace-loving people of China and the Soviet Union will make any imperialist warmonger pale in comparison. Let them tremble before the unbreakable unity and common fighting friendship of the seven hundred million people!

    访苏观感
    中苏友好协会总会  赴苏参观团团长  李敷仁
    深厚的友谊
    我们这次赴苏联参观，第一个给我们永远不可磨灭的印象，是苏联人民对于中国人民的深厚友谊。我们所遇到的每一个苏联人民，不论是集体农庄九十多岁的老庄员或者工厂托儿所的小孩子，都是那么热爱中国人民，那么亲切地欢迎我们。我们不能忘记：明斯克汽车工厂托儿所六岁的小孩子给我们朗诵上海儿童迎接五一节的诗篇。我们不论到哪儿去参观，负责同志都在百忙中放下工作来接待我们，引导我们参观或给我们详细解答问题。我们去参观列宁格勒斯大林金属工厂时，厂里正要开一个重要会议，厂长马上决定会议延期举行，并且说：“中国代表团来了，再没比这更重要的工作了。”我们乘轮船经过齐姆良海的下切尔斯卡雅码头时，码头上早伫立着欢迎的人群，一个女医务工作者代表向我们献花。她说：她们从无线电广播中知道我们要在这里经过，就自动地来欢迎我们。
    苏联人民对于中国人民深厚友谊的更动人的表现，是苏联工厂里的厂长、工程师和先进工人们，都一致表示愿意把他们全部的知识和先进经验毫无保留地教给我们，希望我们多派人到他们工厂里实习。莫斯科奥尔忠尼启则车床工厂，正在为中国工厂制造许多新式的车床，并且已经派遣了一批工程师和技术工人到中国来帮助安装和教会中国工人使用这些新的优良的机器。这个工厂的厂长说：当他们接到为中国工厂制造机器和派遣人员帮助中国建设的任务时，都一致认为这是他们最高的荣誉，愿尽一切力量更快更好地完成这个光荣的任务。我们在列宁格勒斯大林金属工厂和斯维尔德洛夫斯克州的新塔吉尔冶金工厂，都遇到了中国派去实习的人员，他们对于苏联工程师和先进工人们用诲人不倦的态度把自己的知识和经验毫无保留地传授给他们，一致表示非常的满意和衷心的感激。
    苏联人民怀着无限敬爱的心情，学习着中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志的著作。在斯维尔德洛夫斯克的送别宴会上，州的党委宣传部长告诉我们：在座的苏联人都有俄文版的“毛泽东选集”，现在正在学习。苏联人民也爱好中国的文学艺术。我们在莫斯科苏军中央剧院看到了中国话剧“在战斗里成长”的演出，还听到了马思聪和贺绿汀所作的曲子的演奏。我们在斯维尔德洛夫斯克参观一个区的图书馆时，馆长从书架上抽出一本丁玲著的“太阳照在桑干河上”的俄文译本，借书单上已经签了六十多个名字，读到这本书的人当然比这数目要多，而且这本书在这个图书馆里不只一册。
    苏联人民热爱和平，密切关怀中国人民抗美援朝斗争的胜利，每次宴会上都为世界的持久和平干杯，为朝鲜前线中国人民志愿军的胜利干杯。
    保卫和平的伟大力量
    每一个苏联人民都在为和平而辛勤的劳动。我们看到了密布在顿河草原上的绿色的防护林带，我们也看到了列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河和齐姆良海。在干旱的草原上出现了河流、湖泊和面积二十六万公顷的汪洋大海，草原上的人们看到了祖祖辈辈的人们没有见过的海鸥在天空飞翔，夜莺在苍翠的林中歌唱，这在旧的制度下是奇迹，是神话，然而在社会主义的苏联却已经成为现实了。
    我们看到了苏联工业技术的光辉成就。列宁格勒斯大林金属工厂制造出了世界动力史上空前未有的十五万瓩的蒸汽涡轮发电机，现在又正在为伟大的共产主义建设工程——古比雪夫水电站制造十二万瓩的水力发电机。乌拉尔重型机器制造厂已经制成了掘斗容量二十立方公尺的自动行走掘土机，它一次就能掘出三十八吨至四十吨的泥土。我们也看到了全部生产过程自动化的新塔吉尔冶金工厂，工人可以坐在和办公室一样的工作室内操纵全部复杂的生产过程。许多笨重的体力劳动，都为各工厂设计和制造出来的成千成万种复杂的机器所代替了。这些成就，都远远超过资本主义国家了。
    当失业、饥饿正在进攻着资本主义国家的工人阶级的时候，苏联工人却正在发挥积极性和创造性，生气勃勃，满怀信心地向着共产主义前进，生活一天比一天更美好。乌拉尔重型机器制造厂百分之九十八的工人是斯大哈诺夫式工作者，有四十二人荣获斯大林奖金，其中有工人、工程师和职员。在战后七年中，仅在新塔吉尔冶金工厂，国家就给工人建筑了面积超过十万平方公尺的优良住宅，还建筑了文化宫、电影院、托儿所、学校等十余所。
    农业方面，主要农作物生产过程已经全部机械化，技术作物和养畜业已经大量机械化并利用科学方法工作，这使得劳动生产率大大提高了，农民生活也更加富裕了。斯维尔德洛夫集体农庄，革命前每公顷土地只能收获粮食五、六公担，现在已提高到十八至二十公担。黎明集体农庄每一劳动日的报酬，去年只有现款八卢布和二点六公斤粮食，七公斤土豆和一公斤蔬菜，今年计划仅现款一项即可提高至二十卢布。电灯、电话、电影、收音机等许多过去在城市里才能享受到的东西，现在也成为集体农庄庄员的日常生活必需品了。
    我们到处都看到苏维埃人民愉快的和平生活、和平劳动，同时也看到了保卫和平的伟大力量。
    各民族团结友好的大家庭
    苏联各民族友好团结的关系，也使我们十分感动。白俄罗斯和格鲁吉亚等民族在十月革命前，经济上、文化上都是比较不发达的。但在列宁、斯大林民族政策的光辉照耀下，各民族地区都发展了冶金工业和机器制造业，实现了农业集体化，用自己民族的语文消灭了文盲，出版了马克思列宁主义的经典著作，建立了许多高等学校，培养了各民族的青年干部和技术人员。明斯克汽车工厂，把用白俄罗斯文出版的斯大林全集作为礼物送给我们。白俄罗斯和格鲁吉亚的对外文化协会，都把用本民族语文翻译的中国小说集送给我们作为纪念。
    他们一方面发展本民族的文化，一方面也很尊重俄罗斯的文化，尊重俄罗斯民族在历史发展和革命中的地位。他们幼儿园的小孩子，会用本民族的语言朗诵诗篇，也能纯熟地用俄罗斯语言朗诵普希金的作品。他们不是把俄文当作外国语，而是他们的“第二国语”。
    我们在明斯克卫国战争博物馆看到了俄罗斯民族和其他各民族在战争期间的亲密合作，一张游击队的照片，有俄罗斯人、白俄罗斯人和其他各族人民。从明斯克市苏维埃主席的谈话中，我们也知道了俄罗斯及苏联其他各民族在战后恢复期间给予白俄罗斯人民的重大帮助。他说：“如果没有俄罗斯及其他加盟共和国的援助，要恢复我们的城市真是太吃力了。”每次宴会上，白俄罗斯和格鲁吉亚的领导者都举杯为俄罗斯民族，为在座的俄罗斯人干杯。
    用革命史迹教育人民
    苏联党和政府十分重视伟大革命导师们进行过严重的革命斗争的史迹，用这些史迹来教育广大人民群众学习党的光荣的革命历史。我们参观过伟大列宁遭受反动的临时政府迫害时避难的草棚，和草棚附近一高一低的两个树根，列宁就曾坐在这树根上写成了“国家与革命”的初稿。树根还原样无损，草棚早毁坏了，党和政府按照当日的样子把它恢复起来，并用花岗石在旁边建立了纪念碑。在卫国战争时期，政府曾在这里给保卫列宁格勒的英雄们授奖，战士们曾在这里宣誓坚决保卫祖国的土地。我们曾参观过诞生伟大斯大林的小木屋和在斯大林指示下建立起来的第比利斯的地下印刷所。木屋早已破坏，印刷所也曾被沙皇宪兵炸毁，但现在都按当时的式样修复起来，一切陈设都恢复原来的样子。为了利用这些史迹教育人民，便把这些地方改建成博物馆。一声炮响划开人类历史新纪元的阿英乐尔巡洋舰，早就逾龄了，现在已把它建设为博物馆，以它的革命精神来教育千百万人民。
    博物馆是苏联党和政府教育广大人民群众的一个很重要的工具。为使博物馆能完成它的重要使命，必须配备很有修养的人担任说明员的工作。我们参观过许多大的和小的革命历史博物馆，每一个说明员实际上都可以成为很有理论修养的党史教员；他们除以诲人不倦的态度向观众进行解释外，还不断地研究本身业务，参加社会活动，指导机关学校干部和学生的党史学习。
    社会主义的城市建设
    我们在苏联访问过的大小十个城市，使我们很强烈地感觉到：苏联城市建设一个最基本的特点，就是最大限度地满足人民不断增长的物质和文化需要。斯大林格勒把过去车站货仓所在地的伏尔加河边斜坡上的风景区改建为住宅区，明斯克建筑计划中的高楼大厦的住宅，都有宽广的绿荫庭院，使老人、小孩游息不用越过大街，楼下有小的百货店、理发馆、成衣铺和托儿所等居民日常生活必需的设施。罗斯多夫每一居民平均享有约七平方公尺的公共绿化带，城周围种植了二千一百公顷树林还不计算在内；斯大林格勒计划每一居民的绿化地带平均要占十二至十五平方公尺。我们坐汽车游览每一个城的市容时，只见到处都遍布着公园和喷泉，如果登高一些看，则满城都深浸在绿荫丛中。
    我们看见苏联城市建设的第二个特点，是整个城市都是在统一的设计下面建设起来的。我们在明斯克市苏维埃办公室里，不仅看到了整个城市建设计划的平面图，而且有每一条街道每一幢房屋的设计图；每一条街道，不仅哪儿盖职工会的办公处，哪儿是机关，哪儿开银行和百货店，哪儿设电影院和俱乐部，哪儿建造住宅等等早有统一的计划，就是那一幢房屋建成什么式样也先有设计好了的图样。这样就不但使劳动人民工作和生活都十分方便，而且使整个城市整个街道的建筑十分协调。
    苏联城市建设的第三个特点，就是他们把整个城市当作一个艺术建设工程来处理，每一幢房屋都是一个很完美的艺术品。这就把苏联各民族优秀的建筑艺术传统在新的历史和新的技术条件下大大发展了。集中了俄国和世界上有名的建筑师们精心设计出来的列宁格勒固不必说，我们所看到的明斯克、斯大林格勒等城市的建设也是十分美丽的。
    对于被战争破坏了的城市当然可以完全按照新的计划重建起来，对于旧的没有遭受过战争破坏的城市，苏联政府也同样根据居民生活的新的要求进行彻底改造。古老的莫斯科，狭隘的街道和低矮的房屋已经不见了，有着圆柱大厅的职工会大厦，革命前是那一带最高的一座房子，现在已成为最低的了。这座有历史意义的房子，是党和政府有意照原样保存下来的。
    苏联城市建设中还有一点很值得我们学习的，就是广大劳动人民和居民积极参加了城市建设工作。斯大林格勒的恢复和重建中有著名的“契卡索娃运动”，明斯克许多林荫道和广场都是劳动人民业余劳动建造起来的，列宁格勒的劳动人民正在用业余时间建设规模宏大的“胜利公园”。
    我们在苏联看到的东西很多，使我们惊叹，使我们兴奋，使我们感动的事情数也数不清。苏联是世界上第一个劳动人民的祖国，是世界上最先进的国家，不仅在社会制度上是最先进的，而且在科学、技术上也早已远远超过资本主义国家了，文化艺术和人民的道德品质，更不是日趋腐朽的资本主义国家所能比拟。但他们并没有满足于他们既有的成就，正积极劳动，满怀信心地向着人类最美妙的理想——共产主义社会前进。值得我们学习的东西实在太多了。毛主席一再号召我们学习苏联，我们从这次参观和访问中，从实际生活中深刻地体会了我们要建设我们的国家必须“以俄为师”的重要意义。同时，使我们永远铭记的，是中苏两国人民的深厚友谊；这友谊是如此真诚，如此无私，如此深入人心。每一个苏联人民都热爱中国人民，都在时刻关怀着中国人民在建设自己祖国中的需要，愿意随时给我们所需要的一切帮助。这真是伟大的友谊，它将鼓舞我们更加奋勇，更加信心百倍地建设我们的国家。我们更深刻地体会到，苏联人民热爱和平，他们也有信心、有力量保卫和平。爱好和平的中苏两大国人民的紧密团结，将使任何帝国主义战争贩子相顾失色。让他们在七万万人民的牢不可破的团结和共同战斗的友谊面前战抖吧！
