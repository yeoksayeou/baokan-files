    Rebuild and Expand Existing Factories to Fully Exploit Production Potential
    Li Zhi
    Our country's economic construction period has begun. In the future, not only will we build many new factories and mines, but we must also further transform and expand existing enterprises to fully exploit their potential capabilities in order to accelerate the development of our country's industry.
    Our old factories and mines, after three or four years of restoration and transformation, have greatly improved their production capacity. Some of them have the conditions for development. However, some of these enterprises have unreasonable product distribution plans, with many factories making the same products, or one factory producing many different varieties, resulting in unreasonable equipment distribution and underutilization; some have backward production procedures, with manual production methods accounting for too large a proportion; some have unbalanced production capacity in internal workshops; and some have production volumes that are too small to meet national needs. As long as these factories are capable of transformation, we must vigorously transform them, and as long as they have the conditions for expansion, they will be gradually expanded according to the country's overall plan. There are quite a few such factories in our country.
    However, some of our economic workers have a tendency to favor the new and dislike the old, unwilling to utilize old equipment and factory buildings and other factory facilities, only willing to build some large, brand-new factories or workshops. Some designers even believe that "in today's large-scale national construction, designing to repair these dilapidated old factory buildings is too shabby." This kind of blindly pursuing "large-scale" thought that is divorced from the country's existing enterprise base is obviously wrong.
    It is indeed a troublesome thing to make full use of old equipment and factory buildings. Taking design work as an example, when rebuilding and expanding old factories, design personnel are required to go deep into the site, conduct detailed investigations to collect original data, carefully copy the models and specifications of equipment, and appraise their production capacity; they must also carefully measure the dimensions of old factory buildings and calculate their load-bearing capacity, etc. These tasks are often more cumbersome than designing new factory buildings. However, the work of transforming old factories saves the country a lot of investment, and the time to put them into production is also faster. It also enables our country's old enterprises to be reasonably adjusted and fully exert their due role.
    Soviet experts attach great importance to the work of rebuilding and expanding old factories. For example, a factory needed a lot of forgings. In the past, it had been purchasing forging blanks from abroad and then processing and manufacturing them. The factory urgently requested to build a large forging workshop. After research by Soviet experts, it was decided to temporarily rebuild an old forging workshop in the area where the factory was located. Some designers and factory management cadres were reluctant to do this work. They saw that this forging workshop was a legacy of the Japanese occupation era, with cracks in the walls of the factory building and broken components on the roof frame. The main equipment used for production, such as air hammers, was arranged in a chaotic manner. They then believed that "repairing this factory building is not as quick and easy as building a new one." Soviet experts did not think so. They believed that building a new medium-sized forging workshop would require more than 6 billion yuan in factory building costs, and it would also be necessary to order equipment, install equipment and take necessary technical measures, and set up auxiliary sections such as forging dies and heat treatment. The total cost would be about 30 billion yuan. If the old forging workshop, which already had two 1.5-ton impact pressure steam hammers, three or four small air hammers, and a boiler room and substation for its production, was rebuilt, only its equipment would need to be adjusted according to correct and reasonable production procedures, the outer walls and roof frame of the factory building would need to be reinforced, and die manufacturing, heat treatment and necessary sections would need to be added to become an independent forging manufacturing factory. The investment required for this reconstruction would only be enough for several billion yuan, and it would be more than a year faster than building a new one. More importantly, the old forging workshop, which was considered backward in the past, with uneven equipment utilization and unreasonable production procedures, after reconstruction, fully contributed its strength and played its due role on the road of national construction and development. Soviet experts said: "When I think of the situation when our Soviets were first established, when restoring and developing industry, I have to cherish your many old factories and give full play to their role." Of course, the opinions of Soviet experts are correct and very sincere.
    In the design of rebuilding and expanding factories, several principles must be paid attention to.
    First, it is necessary to find ways to make full use of the factory's old facilities, such as the use of old buildings, old power systems, water supply and drainage systems, old transportation facilities, heating facilities, etc. This requires design personnel to conduct careful investigation and research and seek a reasonable plan to utilize them technically. Soviet experts have set many vivid examples in this regard. A Soviet pipeline expert wanted to use an old pipeline system in a factory. He spent three days wearing work clothes and drilling into the underground pipelines for practical research and investigation. Every time he climbed from the underground pipeline to the ground, his face and hair were covered with stinky cement. He didn't care. As soon as he got to the ground, he excitedly talked about his new discoveries in the underground pipeline. Because he carefully investigated the old pipeline and made full use of it in the design, the factory saved several kilometers of pipeline engineering. Another factory's old pipeline was investigated by the factory itself. The investigation was very perfunctory, and the original data was incomplete. As a result, not only could a large number of old pipelines not be used, wasting national funds, but also the newly designed pipeline collided with the old pipeline.
    Second, it is necessary to find ways to give full play to the role of the factory's old production equipment. This requires designers to thoroughly investigate old machine tools, identify them one by one, and assign them to parts processing workshops, tool workshops or other auxiliary workshops according to their production capacity and accuracy. Soviet experts told us that in many famous modern factories in the Soviet Union, there are still many old machine tools that have been used for many years; the old workers who work on these machine tools cherish these machine tools very much and regard them as their close friends; although the machine tools have been used for a long time, they can still maintain a high level of efficiency and quality. Some of our designers often dislike old machine tools, thinking that they are inefficient, inaccurate, and prone to accidents. Some people even think that putting them together with many brand-new machine tools makes the workshop look uncoordinated. This view is of course extremely wrong. For old non-production auxiliary equipment, designers should also make full use of it. For example, in the example of rebuilding the forging workshop mentioned above, some disputes occurred during the design process: the forging workshop originally had two crank-arm cranes specially used for two air hammers. After the reconstruction, in order to improve the production procedures, the positions of the air hammers were moved. Some designers and factory production leaders believed that the old cranes were too old and manually operated, which did not meet the modern construction procedures. It was not necessary to move them with the old air hammers, but to add a bridge-type heavy-duty electric crane at the new location of the air hammers. Doing so would cost more than 200 million yuan more than the reconstruction plan. After studying with Soviet experts, it was still decided to use the old cranes. Another example is that the air hammers in the workshop originally used steam and had a boiler room and gas supply device. Some designers and factory production leaders insisted on using compressed air instead. They believed that this would make the workshop cleaner. However, if all of them were changed to compressed air hammers, the old boiler room would have to be abolished, a new compressed air station would have to be built, the power consumption would have to be increased, the substation would have to be expanded, and a cooling pool and water supply device would have to be made for the compressed air machine. This series of measures greatly increased investment. The incorrectness of this approach is obvious.
    Third, it is necessary to correctly analyze what role the enterprise can currently play and what role it will play after the transformation. This analysis should be carried out from many aspects. It is necessary to study the possibility of the existing factory area developing, whether the factory area meets the construction requirements, whether the product distribution is reasonable, the current production conditions, and the cooperation with other factories and enterprises. If we unilaterally and in isolation decide to rebuild and expand a factory based on one aspect of the factors, we will make major mistakes. For example, the designers of a design unit, listening to some wrong opinions, believed that a certain factory played a major role in the Liberation War, had a glorious tradition of struggle, and had a certain number of skilled workers and machine tool equipment, so they decided to rebuild and expand the factory. After the design, they built factory buildings, added workers, and ordered equipment. Now that the factory has been built, the location of the factory is an extremely remote mountainous area with extremely inconvenient transportation. Heavy machinery and equipment were transported by car along bumpy mountain roads. Due to the addition of equipment, the electricity was not enough, so they had to ask the power department to build a 6,000-kilowatt power station nearby. In order to solve the future transportation problems of materials and products, they also requested the railway department to lay a branch line from the railway trunk line 200 kilometers away. As a result, the investment of other departments in this factory exceeded the investment required by the factory itself by one time.
    It should be understood that our purpose in rebuilding and expanding a factory is to enable it to play a greater role in production with less national investment and in a shorter period of time. We are definitely not going to accommodate the backwardness of the factory's original foundation, but to transform them.
    Of course, when considering how to give full play to the potential strength of existing factories, we may encounter some incorrect ideological obstacles, but enterprise leaders and design workers must adhere to the correct principles and fight against these incorrect ideas. The first is to fight against the conservative ideas of design personnel and factory production management cadres. Some design personnel do not conduct in-depth investigation and research. As soon as they encounter the design of rebuilding old factories, they have "concerns," wanting to increase the safety factor, or greatly discount the utilization rate of old equipment, using a higher rate and adopting a larger number of equipment, wasting national resources. For example, some cadres believe that workers in old factories are not familiar with the advanced construction specifications after the reconstruction, and require increasing the manufacturing man-hours of products, which will also cause the above-mentioned bad results. For example, a factory is to be rebuilt into a larger machine manufacturing factory, and its task is to imitate a new type of machine from the Soviet Union. When this machine was produced on a small scale in the Soviet Union, it required a total of 12,000 man-hours per unit, and even fewer man-hours when produced on a larger scale. However, our design personnel, when doing the reconstruction design, over-considered various negative factors in production and the current technical conditions in China, and planned the manufacturing man-hours per unit to be 20,000 man-hours, and the equipment utilization rate was also very low. As a result, this factory is one and a half times larger than similar factories in the Soviet Union. The design carried out under the guidance of this wrong principle will inevitably produce the following two adverse consequences: on the one hand, it will waste national investment; on the other hand, after the production efficiency is improved in the future, it may cause the production capacity of each workshop in the factory to be uncoordinated, and may affect the mutual balance of raw material supply, product manufacturing, and product sales required in the national plan. Conservative ideas are also manifested in the lack of estimation of the production capacity and various original conditions of old factories, and an excessive distrust of old equipment, forming the idea of "disliking the old and liking the new" and "rather big than small."
    At the same time, enterprise leaders and design workers also need to fight against the impetuous and adventurous ideas of some people. Some cadres do not start from the existing foundation and wish that their factories would immediately become large-scale, modern factories. They do not use methods such as promoting production balance, improving equipment utilization and labor productivity, and reducing reject rates to give full play to existing forces, accumulate funds for expanded reproduction, improve workers' production technology, and lay the foundation for large-scale production, but blindly demand to add equipment and expand the operating area. We have seen that the utilization rate of existing equipment in many rebuilt factories is less than 50%, and in one factory it is only 32%, and the utilization rate of equipment in individual workshops is as low as 13%. Some people leave machine tools that have been installed for two years idle in the workshop without starting them, but blindly demand to expand the operating area and add machine tools. This kind of thinking is quite common among cadres in the production department. Soviet experts said: "Our design department is not the 'all-request-and-all-response god' of the production department. Designers should stand on the position of saving national funds and maintaining the national plan, and promote the production department to make full use of the potential strength of the factory and improve production."
    Economic leaders and design workers also need to fight against various narrow departmentalism ideas. Rebuilding and expanding a factory will inevitably require adjusting equipment and establishing cooperative relationships with other factories and enterprises, which will often offend those cadres who have departmentalism ideas. They attempt to own more equipment, and even want to put the equipment that they don't need in the warehouse, euphemistically called "standby." Some cadres hope that their factories will become "independent" and "not dependent on others" factories, always demanding that their factories have their own sets of everything, and are unwilling to unite some workshops with large production capacity with other factories; they are also unwilling to cooperate with others in public utility facilities, which hinders the design principles of giving full play to the potential strength of existing factories, increases investment, and causes waste.

    改建和扩建原有工厂，充分发挥生产潜力
    立之
    我国经济建设时期开始了。今后我们不但要建立很多新的工厂和矿山，而且还必需进一步改造和扩建现有企业，充分发挥其潜在能力，以便加速我国工业的发展。
    我们旧有的工厂矿山，经过三四年以来的恢复和改造，生产能力已经大大提高。它们之中有一些是具有发展的条件的。但是这些企业有的是产品分布计划不合理，同一样的产品很多工厂都做，或者是一个工厂要生产很多不同的品种，因而造成设备分布上的不合理和不能充分使用的情况；有一些是生产程序落后，手工生产方式占的比例太大；有些是工厂内部的车间生产能力不均衡；还有些是生产量太小，不能满足国家需要。这些工厂只要具备改造的可能，我们都要大力进行改造，只要具备扩展的条件，都将按照国家的整体计划逐步地给以扩展。而这种工厂，在我们国家是不少的。
    但我们有些经济工作人员有着喜新厌旧的思想，不愿意利用旧有设备和厂房以及工厂的其他设施，只愿意建设一些大型的、崭新的工厂或车间，有的设计人员甚至认为“在国家大规模建设的今天，为修理这些破漏的旧厂房做设计，未免太寒呛了。”这种脱离国家现有企业基础的盲目追求“大规模”的思想，显然是错误的。
    要充分利用旧有设备和厂房建筑物，确实是一件很麻烦的事情。以设计工作为例，在改建和扩建旧工厂时，要求设计人员深入现场，详细地调查收集原始资料，认真地抄录设备的型号、规格，并鉴定其生产能力；还要仔细地测量旧有厂房建筑物的尺寸，计算它们的荷重等，这些工作往往比新建厂房的设计还要繁琐得多。但是改造旧厂的工作，比起新建的工厂来，既节省国家大量投资，其投入生产的时间也较快，更能使我国旧有的企业得到合理的调整，充分发挥其应有的作用。
    苏联专家很重视改建和扩建旧厂的工作。例如有一个工厂需要很多锻件，过去一直是在国外购买锻件毛胚，然后加工制造。该厂急切要求新建大型的锻造车间，经过苏联专家的研究，决定暂时将该厂所在区域的一个旧锻工场加以改建。有些设计人员和工厂管理干部都不乐意干这件工作。他们看到这个锻工场是日本统治时代的遗物，厂房的墙上已有裂缝，房架上也有断折的构件，生产用的主要设备如气锤等摆布得很混乱，于是认为“修这个厂房，还不如盖一个新的来得痛快、省事。”苏联专家可不是这样看法。他认为新建一个中型的锻造车间，厂房建造费用就需六十亿元以上，还须要订购设备，安装设备及其必要的技术措施，还须要设置锻模、热处理等辅助工段，所需费用共计在三百亿元左右；如果改建这个已拥有两个一吨半冲击压力的蒸气锤、三四个小型气锤、并有供其生产用的锅炉房、变电所等设备的旧锻工场，只需按照正确合理的生产程序调整其设备，加固厂房的外墙和房架，添设锻模制造、热处理及其必要的工段，就能成为一个独立的锻件制造工厂了，这样改建所费的投资只需几十亿元就够了，而且在时间上，比新建的要快一年多。更重要的是，过去被人认为落后的，设备使用率不均衡、生产程序不合理的旧锻工场，经过改建后，在国家建设发展的道路上，充分地贡献出了它的力量，发挥了它的应有的作用。苏联专家说：“一想起我们苏维埃刚建立起来，在恢复和发展工业时的情况，我不得不十分珍惜你们这许多旧有的工厂，充分地发挥它们的作用。”当然，苏联专家的意见是正确的也是十分诚恳的。
    在改建和扩建工厂的设计中，必须注意几个原则。
    首先，必须设法充分利用工厂的旧有的设施，例如利用旧有房屋建筑、旧有的电力系统、供水及排水系统、旧有的交通运输设施、供热设施等。这就要求设计人员细心地调查研究，并在技术上求得合理地利用它们的方案。苏联专家在这一方面做出了很多生动的范例。有一位苏联管道专家，想利用一个工厂旧有的管道系统，他整整花了三天功夫，穿着工作服，钻到地下管道里去，实际研究考察。每次他由地下管道里爬到地面，脸上、头发上都是臭水泥，他毫不介意，一到地面上，就兴奋地谈他在地下管道的新发现。由于他这样细心地考察旧有管道，并在设计中充分利用它们，使该厂节省了数公里的管道工程。而另一个工厂的旧管道是由该厂自行调查的，调查得很草率，原有的资料又不全，结果不但使大量的旧有管道不能利用、浪费了国家资金，并且使新设计的管道与旧有管道相碰。
    其次，必须设法充分发挥工厂旧有生产设备的作用。这就要设计者详尽调查旧机床，逐个地进行甄别，按其生产能力及精确度，分配到零件加工车间、工具车间或其他辅助车间去用。苏联专家告诉我们：在苏联很多著名的近代化的工厂里，还有不少用过许多年月的旧机床；在这些机床上工作的老工人，非常爱护这些机床，把这些机床看成自己亲密的朋友；虽然机床用的年代较久，但仍能保持效率高、质量好的水平。我们有些设计人员却常嫌旧机床没有用，认为它们效率低、精确度不好、易发生事故等。有些人甚至认为把它们与很多崭新的机床并列在一起，使得车间看起来不够协调。这种看法当然是极端错误的。对于旧有的非生产的辅助设备，设计者也应该同样地予以充分利用。例如在上面举的改建锻工场的例子当中，在设计过程中，曾发生过一些争执：该锻工场原有两个专供两个气锤使用的拐臂式起重机，改建之后，为了改进生产程序，把气锤的位置迁移了，有些设计人员和工厂生产领导干部，认为旧起重机太老了，而且是手动式的，不合近代化的施工程序，可以不必随着旧气锤搬家，而要在气锤新位置处添设一个桥式重型的电动起重机。这样做会使投资较改建的方案多两亿多元。与苏联专家研究后，还是确定利用旧起重机。又如该车间的气锤原来是使用蒸气的，并有锅炉房和供气装置，有些设计人员和工厂生产领导干部坚持改为使用压缩空气的。他们认为这样可以使车间清洁一些。可是，如果全部改为压缩空气锤的话，则必须废除旧锅炉房，另建立新的压缩空气站，要扩大用电量及扩建变电站，并需为压缩空气机做冷却池及供水装置。这一系列的措施，使得投资大量增加。这种做法之不正确再明显也没有了。
    第三，要正确地分析该企业目前能起什么作用，改造以后将起什么作用。这种分析是要从多方面来进行的。要研究现有工厂厂区发展的可能性、厂区是否合于建筑要求、产品分布是否合理、现在的生产条件、以及其他工厂企业的协作等一系列问题。如果片面地孤立地从一方面的因素去决定改建和扩建一个工厂，就会犯重大的错误。譬如有一个设计单位的设计人员，听信一些错误意见，认为某厂在解放战争中起过重大的作用，有着光荣的斗争传统，而且有一定的技术工人和机床设备，因而决定要改建并扩建这个工厂。设计以后，就建造厂房，增添工人，并订购了设备。现在工厂建立起来了，但工厂所在地是极为偏僻的山区，交通运输极不方便，重型的机器设备是用汽车经过颠簸的山路运去的。由于增添了设备，电力不够使用，不得不要求电业部门在附近建立一个六千基罗瓦特的发电站。为了解决将来的材料及产品运输问题，又请求铁道部门自二百公里以外的铁路干线上铺设支线。结果，使得其他各部门对这个工厂的投资，超过工厂本身所需投资一倍。
    应该了解，我们改建和扩建一个工厂，目的在于以较少的国家投资，和较短的时间内使它在生产中发挥更大的作用。我们决不是去迁就这个工厂原有基础的落后性，而是要去改造它们。
    当然，在考虑如何发挥现有工厂潜在力量时，可能碰到一些不正确的思想障碍，但企业领导者和设计工作者必须坚持正确的原则，跟这些不正确的思想作斗争。首先是跟设计人员及工厂生产管理干部的保守思想作斗争。有些设计人员不深入调查研究，一碰到旧厂改建设计就存有“戒心”，要加大安全系数，或对旧设备的利用率打很大的折扣，使用率而采用数量较多的设备，浪费了国家资财。又如一些干部认为旧厂工人不熟悉改建后的先进施工规范，而要求增大产品制造工时，这也将造成上述不好的结果。例如有一个工厂要改建成为一个较大的机器制造厂，其任务是仿制苏联的一种新型机器，这种机器在苏联小规模生产时，每台共需一万二千工时，较大规模生产时，工时更少。但我们的设计人员在做改建设计时，过多考虑生产中各种消极因素，以及中国目前的技术条件，把每台制造工时拟为二万工时，采用的设备利用率也很低。这样一来，这个工厂比苏联同类的工厂要大一倍半。在这种错误的原则指导下进行的设计，必然产生以下两个不良后果：一方面是浪费国家投资；另一方面在将来生产效率提高后，可能使工厂各车间生产能力不配合，并且可能影响到国家计划中要求的原料供应、产品制造及产品销售相互的平衡。保守思想还表现在对于旧有工厂的生产能力及各种原有条件估计不足，对于旧设备采取过分的不信任态度，形成“厌旧喜新”、“宁大勿小”的思想。
    同时，企业领导工作者和设计工作者还需跟某些人的急躁冒进思想作斗争。有些干部不是从现有基础出发，恨不得他们的工厂立即成为大规模生产的、近代化的工厂。他们不是用尽量促使生产平衡、提高设备使用率及劳动生产率、减低废品率等方法来发挥现有力量，以积累扩大再生产的资金，提高工人生产技术，奠定大规模生产的基础，而是盲目要求增添设备和扩大作业面积。我们见到很多改建工厂现有设备使用率都不到百分之五十，有一个工厂仅到百分之三十二，个别车间设备使用率低到百分之十三。有些人把安装了两年的机床搁置在车间里不开动，却一味要求扩大作业面积，增添机床。这种思想在生产部门的干部中相当普遍。苏联专家说：“我们设计部门不是生产部门的‘有求必应之神’，设计者应该站在节省国家资金、维护国家计划的立场，促使生产部门充分利用厂内潜在力量，提高生产。”
    经济领导干部和设计工作者还须要跟各种狭窄的本位主义思想作斗争。改建和扩建一个工厂，必然要调整设备，要与其他工厂企业发生协作关系，这就往往要触犯那些具有本位主义思想的干部。他们企图拥有更多的设备，甚至对他们用不着的设备，也想搁在仓库里，美其名曰“备用”。有些干部希望自己的工厂成为“独立自主”“不依赖他人”的工厂，总要求自己工厂各样都自成一套，不愿把一些生产能力大的车间与其他工厂联合；在公用事业设施上也不愿与他人协作，结果使发挥现有工厂潜在力量之设计原则受到阻碍，使得投资增大，造成浪费。
