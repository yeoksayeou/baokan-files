Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: The media and people of the Eastern European People's Democratic Countries, the German Democratic Republic, and the Mongolian People's Republic attach great importance to the speech delivered by G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, at the closing session of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on August 8th. Newspapers in various countries prominently published this important speech, and many newspapers published editorials on it. Radio stations in various countries also broadcast Malenkov's speech.

In Czechoslovakia, "Rude Pravo," "People's Defense," "Youth Front," "Free Word," and "People's Democracy" all published editorials unanimously supporting the action program of the Soviet government mentioned in Malenkov's speech. "Rude Pravo" said that the people of our country not only found support for their desire for peace in the Soviet Union, but also saw a vivid example of their own happy future in the happy life of the Soviet people. Our people will cherish and vigilantly protect the unbreakable friendship with the powerful Soviet people, and regard it as one of the main guarantees for striving for their own happy future.

The "People's Tribune," the organ of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, published an editorial saying: Malenkov's speech is a new contribution to stopping the forces of war. His speech pointed out the path to easing international tensions and vividly demonstrated the strength of the great Soviet state leading the democratic camp in defending peace. Our people, like the people of other countries, believe that a peaceful solution to the German question is of great significance for the sake of peace in Europe, for the interests of Germany's neighbors, and for all the German people.

Hungary's "Free People's Daily" published an editorial saying: The Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union vividly demonstrated the great strength of the Soviet state and the unity of the Soviet people around their great party. The people of the world can once again believe that the path taken by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in guiding the Soviet people is the correct path for improving the material and cultural standards of the working people. The Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy has won the sympathy and support of hundreds of millions of people in various countries.

In Bulgaria, thousands of working people directly listened to the broadcast of Malenkov's speech by the Soviet radio station. "Workers' Affairs" pointed out in an editorial on the 11th that the victorious development of the Soviet economy is of world historical significance. Due to rapid industrialization, the world's first socialist country has become an insurmountable obstacle for all aggressors and those who attempt to enslave free countries. Economic cooperation with the Soviet Union greatly increases the economic potential of the people's democratic countries, enabling the entire democratic camp to implement the policy of continuously improving people's lives at a faster rate.

Romania's "Spark" published an editorial saying: All the work of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was full of stability, strength, and certainty. The Soviet government's decision to allocate 1 billion rubles to Korea to restore the destroyed national economy has been warmly praised by all progressive humanity. People's democratic countries, including Hungary, have also expressed their determination to give fraternal assistance to the Korean people.

The Albanian "People's Voice" said in its editorial that Malenkov's speech powerfully demonstrated the correct policy consistently implemented by the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union. The "Unity Daily" wrote in its editorial that Malenkov's speech is new proof of the Soviet Union's consistent pursuit of a peaceful policy of developing international relations on the basis of mutual consultation and voluntariness. The people of the world welcome the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and believe that it is the only way to consolidate peace and the security of the people of all countries.

In the German Democratic Republic, the "New Germany" published the full text of Comrade Malenkov's speech on the 11th. The newspaper pointed out: The German people believe that Malenkov's speech is a new step towards peacefully resolving all disputed issues, including the German question. The "Morning Post" pointed out in its editorial: Malenkov's speech pointed out the path to convene a conference of great powers to conduct consultations and resolve international disputes, first and foremost the German question.

The Mongolian People's Republic's "Truth Daily" pointed out in its editorial the great significance of the profound analysis of the international situation in Malenkov's speech. The newspaper said that inspired by the achievements of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian working people will redouble their efforts to realize the task of building socialism.
