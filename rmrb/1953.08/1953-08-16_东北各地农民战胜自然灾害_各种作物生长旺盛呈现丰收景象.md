    In Northeast China, various crops are growing vigorously, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest. All 3.43 million hectares (1 hectare = 15 Chinese mu) of sorghum and 2.93 million hectares of millet in the region have headed; in the southern areas, sorghum has even begun to mature. 2.75 million hectares of corn have tasseled and formed cobs, 2.96 million hectares of soybeans have finished flowering and are forming pods, 297,000 hectares of cotton are flowering and forming bolls, and 318,000 hectares of rice and other grain crops and industrial raw material crops are all growing strong. In some areas, crops have suffered from pests, waterlogging, and other disasters, and active efforts are being made to rescue them.
    This year, inspired by the start of large-scale national construction, Northeast farmers, in order to complete the task of increasing grain production, have not only focused on adopting the high-yield experience of Guo Houqi, but have also more widely improved farming techniques. The area fertilized throughout the region has increased by 10% compared to last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied per unit area has also increased. Farmers have actively selected fine seeds and treated seeds with pesticides: in Songjiang Province, fine soybean varieties account for more than 90% of the total soybean area; the amount of sorghum, millet and other seeds treated with pesticides in the region has more than doubled compared to last year. Most sowing is done evenly and accurately, greatly reducing the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows, and creating a new atmosphere of more seedlings and complete stands. During the busy summer farming season, almost all the labor force in the countryside that could participate in summer hoeing went to the fields. Through intensive labor, they overcame excessive rain and seedling shortages, eliminated pests, and provided better growing conditions for various crops.
    The support from the state and the assistance from the working class have played a significant role in the development of agricultural production and increased grain production for Northeast farmers. This year, agricultural production loans of 7,648 billion yuan were distributed in a timely manner throughout the region, enabling farmers to purchase a large amount of new farm implements, draft animals, pesticides, seeds and other means of production. According to incomplete statistics, farmers in the region used loans to purchase more than 20,000 draft horses. In Chengde County, Rehe Province, farmers used loans to build water conservancy projects, which exempted 30% of the farmland from spring drought. The more than 80,000 sets of comprehensive shovel and cultivator machines manufactured by various farm tool factories in Northeast China over the years and distributed to farmers have played a very good role in this year's summer hoeing.
    The further improvement and development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Northeast China this year is an important guarantee for farmers to improve farming techniques and overcome natural disasters such as spring drought and summer floods. The mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various places, after rectification before spring plowing, especially after correcting some tendencies of blind and rash advances, have generally been strengthened compared to before. The number of permanent teams has increased, and the agricultural production cooperatives piloted at the district level have also demonstrated their superiority in production. In addition, rural work cadres at all levels have earnestly improved their leadership style, gone deep into the fields, participated in production, and helped farmers solve specific problems, which has also greatly promoted the farmers' enthusiasm for production.
    Currently, Northeast farmers are fighting various disasters in an organized manner to protect crops and strive for a bumper harvest. Farmers along the main streams and tributaries of the Liao River and Songhua River, under the leadership of the flood control command, are reinforcing dikes and monitoring flood conditions. Farmers in Liaodong, Rehe and other provinces are actively preventing the occurrence of the second generation of armyworms, concentrating their efforts on digging pupae, catching moths, and picking egg masses.

    东北各地农民战胜自然灾害
    各种作物生长旺盛呈现丰收景象
    东北各地各种农作物生长旺盛，呈现了丰收的景象。全区三百四十三万垧（每垧十五市亩）高粱和二百九十三万垧谷子都已吐穗，南部地区的高粱并已开始晒米，二百七十五万垧玉米已出蓼结棒，二百九十六万垧大豆已落花结荚，二十九万七千垧棉花正开花结桃，三十一万八千垧水稻和其他粮食作物、工业原料作物都很茁壮。部分地区的庄稼受虫、水等灾害，正在积极进行抢救。
    今年，东北农民在国家开始大建设的鼓舞下，为了完成增产粮食的任务，除重点采用郭后旗的丰产经验外，还比较普遍地改进了耕作技术。全区施肥面积比去年增加了百分之十，单位面积施肥量也有增加。农民纷纷精选良种和用药剂拌种：松江省的大豆总面积中，良种大豆的面积就占百分之九十以上；全区高粱、谷子等种籽，拌用药剂的比去年增加一倍多。播种中大多作到点匀点正，缺苗断条的现象便大大减少，普遍出现了苗多苗全的新气象。夏季农忙期间，农村中一切能够参加夏锄的劳动力几乎全部下了地，经过紧张的劳动，战胜了雨多苗荒，扑灭了虫害，使各种作物获得了较好的生育条件。
    国家的扶助和工人阶级的支援，对东北农民发展农业生产、增产粮食的作用很大。今年全区及时地发放了七千六百四十八亿元农业生产贷款，使农民们买进了新式农具和耕畜、农药、种籽等大量生产资料。据不完全统计，全区农民使用贷款买进的耕马达两万多匹。热河省承德县农民使用贷款兴修水利后，使百分之三十的耕地免除了春旱。几年来东北各农具制造厂制造的、陆续发放到农民手中的八万多台综合号铲趟机，在今年夏锄中发挥了极好的效用。
    今年东北互助合作运动的进一步提高与发展，是农民们得以改进耕作技术和战胜春旱、夏涝等自然灾害的重要保证。各地互助合作组织经过春耕前的整顿，特别是纠正了某些盲目冒进的偏向后，普遍比前加强，常年组数量增加，区级试办的农业生产合作社也在生产中发挥了优越性。此外，各级农村工作干部认真改进领导作风，深入田间，参加生产，帮助农民解决具体问题，对提高农民的生产热情也有很大作用。
    目前，东北农民为了保护庄稼，争取丰收，正有组织地和各种灾害作斗争。辽河、松花江干流和支流沿岸的农民，在防汛指挥机关的领导下，正在加固堤防和监视汛情。辽东、热河等省农民积极防止第二代粘虫发生，集中力量挖蛹、捕蛾、摘卵块。 （新华社）
