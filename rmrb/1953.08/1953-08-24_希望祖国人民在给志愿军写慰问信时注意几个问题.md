    Some Issues for the People of the Motherland to Note When Writing Letters of Condolence to the Volunteer Army
    (I)
    Letters from Xie Pingbo and Hu Zhenze of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army: Since the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the people of the motherland have sent a large number of condolences and letters of sympathy, which has greatly boosted our fighting will. Every soldier and officer of the Volunteer Army expresses heartfelt gratitude to the people of the motherland for this material and spiritual assistance and encouragement.
    In the past, we have found some issues that deserve attention in handling letters of condolence. In order to ensure that letters of condolence are delivered to the soldiers in a timely manner, so as to play a greater political role, we would like to offer the following suggestions to the people of the motherland:
    1. For letters of condolence from the people of the motherland to the Volunteer Army, if they are of a general nature (not specifically addressed to a particular person or unit), it is best to indicate the words "Letter of Condolence" on the envelope. The recipient on the envelope only needs to write "Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Korean Front" and does not need to write "Commander Peng's Office," "Volunteer Army Political Department," or "Volunteer Army Headquarters," etc., in order to avoid repeated transfers and delays. For important criticisms, suggestions, and letters of a non-general nature, there is no need to indicate the nature on the envelope; just send them to the "Volunteer Army Political Department."
    2. For letters of condolence to famous combat heroes and meritorious individuals, if their names and units are known, they can be sent directly to that unit for forwarding. For example, letters of condolence to Air Force heroes Wang Hai, Zhang Jihui, Zhao Baotong, and other comrades should preferably be addressed to "Volunteer Army Air Force Political Department," rather than "Volunteer Army Political Department." If the unit is not known, it can be forwarded through the Volunteer Army Political Department, but it is best to indicate on the back of the envelope when and in which newspaper or magazine his heroic deeds were seen, so as to promptly investigate and forward the letter.
    3. If the people of the motherland are writing letters of condolence to the Volunteer Army during major festivals, it is best to write and send them in advance. Due to transportation limitations, letters sent from the motherland to the Korean front generally take half a month to a month to arrive. Letters of condolence commemorating festivals can be delivered to the soldiers in a timely manner if they are written and sent early.
    4. If it is a letter seeking a person, the words "Seeking a Person Letter" should be written on the envelope to avoid confusion with letters of condolence.
    (II)
    Letter from Gao Yintian of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army: Newspapers and books sent by the people of the motherland to the Volunteer Army are often damaged due to the long distance and frequent transfers during delivery, or they cannot be delivered due to damaged packaging and blurred addresses of the recipients. For example, six volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" sent by the Guangzhou Xinhua Bookstore to a certain unit of the Volunteer Army were not only damaged at the corners during delivery due to poor packaging, but the unit number written on the package was also blurred, resulting in failure to deliver and return. Other magazines such as "China Youth," "World Knowledge," and "New Observer" also had similar situations during delivery. Therefore, I hope that the people of the motherland will pay attention to ensuring that the packaging is firm when sending newspapers and books to the Volunteer Army in the future.

### 希望祖国人民在给志愿军写慰问信时注意几个问题

专栏：读者来信摘要

    希望祖国人民在给志愿军写慰问信时注意几个问题
    （一）
    志愿军政治部谢平波、胡震泽来信：自从开展抗美援朝运动以来，祖国人民送来大批慰劳品和慰问信，大大鼓舞了我们的战斗意志。每个志愿军指战员对祖国人民给我们的这种物质上、精神上的援助和鼓励，都表示衷心的感谢。
    过去我们在处理慰问信中，发现一些值得注意的问题。为了使慰问信及时送到战士手中，以发挥更大的政治作用，特向祖国人民提供几点建议：
    一、祖国人民给志愿军的慰问信，如属一般性的
    （不是指定给某一个人或某一个单位的），最好在信封上写明“慰问信”字样。信封上的收信人只要写“朝鲜前线中国人民志愿军收”即可，不必写 “彭司令员收”、“志愿军政治部收”或“志愿军司令部收”等字样，以免辗转传递，耽误时间。如属重要的批评、建议及非一般性质的信件，则信封上不必标明性质，寄“志愿军政治部”即可。
    二、写给著名战斗英雄和功臣的慰问信，如已知其姓名和部别的，可直接写给该部转交。例如给空军英雄王海、张积慧、赵宝桐等同志的慰问信，最好写“志愿军空军政治部转”，不必写“志愿军政治部转”。如果不知部别的，可经志愿军政治部转，但最好在信封的反面注明何时在何报刊上看到他的英雄事迹，以便及时查明转递。
    三、祖国人民如在重大节日给志愿军写慰问信时，最好能提前写好送来。因为交通条件的限制，由祖国寄到朝鲜前方的信件，一般要半个月到一个月才能收到。纪念节日的慰问信如能提早写出寄来，就可以在节日及时送到战士手里。
    四、如属寻人信件，应在信封上写明“寻人信”的字样，以免和慰问信混淆。
    （二）
    志愿军某部高荫田来信：祖国人民寄给志愿军的报刊和书籍，因为寄递时路途遥远，辗转频繁，要是包装不周，常常会使邮件受到破损，或因包皮破损、收件人的地址模糊而无法寄递。如广州新华书店寄给志愿军某部的“毛泽东选集”六册，因包装不周，寄递时不但书角均已破损，而且包皮上所写部队番号也弄得模糊不清，结果无法寄递，只好退回。其他如“中国青年”、“世界知识”、“新观察”等杂志在寄递时也有类似情形。因此，我希望祖国人民今后给志愿军寄报刊、书籍时，应该注意要使包装牢固。
