Hubei Province held a provincial Industry and Commerce Trade Conference from July 26th to August 9th, convened by the Commercial Department of the Hubei Provincial People's Government. Attendees included directors of industry and commerce sections/bureaus of special districts and cities, managers of wholesale stations, heads of county industry and commerce sections, and managers of county stores in the three systems of general merchandise, cotton yarn and cloth, and trade, as well as relevant planning personnel. The conference studied issues such as preparing for the peak market season, meeting residents' needs, resolving the organization of goods supply, expanding import and export plans, and ensuring market supply.

The meeting examined and criticized the shortcomings of state-owned commercial departments in the first half of the year regarding the lack of a clear understanding of the views that commerce should serve production, serve the needs of residents, further invigorate the urban and rural economy, expand commodity circulation, stimulate the normal development of industrial and agricultural production, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance economically. It was believed that in the first half of the year, state-owned commercial departments, due to a lack of comprehensive policy views, a one-sided understanding of the significance of economic accounting, and an excessive emphasis on "emptying the bowels" (reducing inventory), reduced processing orders, which also affected the production of local industry and handicrafts to some extent; thus, a shortage of goods was created, the needs of the masses could not be met, and the guiding role of state-owned commerce in the market was weakened.

The meeting mainly clarified and resolved the following issues: (1) It clarified that the specific guideline for state-owned commercial work in the second half of this year is: to fully recognize that a bumper harvest is in sight throughout the province, and grain, cotton, and native products will soon be on the market. State-owned commerce must strengthen the purchase of native products, actively organize goods supply, rapidly organize industrial products to go to the countryside, ensure supply, stabilize prices, and further improve operation and management. (2) It clearly stipulated that the fundamental guideline for state-owned commerce in this province should be, in accordance with the general guideline of state-owned commerce, to affirm serving the national industrial construction, serving agricultural production, serving local industry and handicrafts within the province, and serving the ever-increasing needs of the broad masses in economic and cultural life. Therefore, it is necessary to further invigorate the urban and rural economy, expand commodity circulation, and ensure market supply. (3) In accordance with the general guideline of state-owned commerce, and based on the different business scopes of each company, the commodity circulation plans for the second half of the year were discussed and revised. In order to meet the needs of the state and the people and do a good job in peak season supply, the import and export targets of both the general merchandise and cotton yarn and cloth systems have been increased compared with the actual import and export performance in the same period last year. The sales plan of the general merchandise company has increased by 51 percent, and the purchase plan has increased by more than 60 percent.

After analyzing the market situation, the meeting emphatically pointed out that state-owned commercial workers must have a sufficient understanding of the generally increased purchasing power of the masses in welcoming the autumn and winter peak season. They must vigorously organize goods supply, especially processing orders with local industry and handicrafts, to ensure market supply after the autumn harvest.

    湖北省举行工商贸易大会
    批判过去工作中的缺点、决定努力组织货源保证市场供应
    湖北省人民政府商业厅在七月二十六日到八月九日召开全省工商贸易大会。到会的有专区、市的工商科、局长，批发站经理，县工商科长和百货、花纱布、贸易等三个系统的县商店经理以及有关的计划人员。会上研究了迎接市场旺季，满足居民需要，解决组织货源、扩大进销货计划、保证市场供应等问题。
    会议检查批判了上半年国营商业部门对商业应为生产服务、为居民需要服务，进一步活跃城乡经济，扩大商品流通、刺激工农业生产的正常发展，以及从经济上巩固工农联盟的观点不明确等缺点。认为上半年国营商业部门由于缺乏全面的政策观点，片面地理解经济核算的意义，过分强调“泻肚子”，减少加工订货，使地方工业及手工业生产也受了些影响；因而造成货源不足，不能满足群众需要，削弱了国营商业对市场领导的作用。
    会议主要明确和解决了如下问题：（一）明确了今年下半年国营商业工作的具体方针是：要充分认识到全省丰收在望，粮棉土特产即将上市，国营商业要加强土特产收购，积极组织货源，迅速组织工业品下乡，保证供应，稳定物价，并进一步改善经营管理。（二）明确规定了本省国营商业的根本方针，应该是按照国营商业的总方针，肯定为国家工业建设服务，为农业生产服务，为省内地方工业及手工业服务，并为广大人民在经济生活上、文化生活上的日益增涨的需要服务。因而必须进一步活跃城乡经济，扩大商品流通，保证市场供应。（三）按照国营商业总的方针，根据各公司业务范围的不同，讨论修订了下半年商品流转计划。为了适应国家和人民的需要，做好旺季供应，百货、花纱布两系统进销货指标都较去年下半年同期进销货实绩有所增加。百货公司销货计划增加百分之五十一，进货计划增加百分之六十强。
    会议分析了市场情况后，着重指出国营商业工作人员对迎接秋冬旺季，群众购买力普遍提高的情况要有足够认识，必须大力组织货源，尤其是对当地地方工业和手工业的加工订货，以保证秋后市场供应。
