    On Capitalist Encirclement
    Soviet Union Hāla’ěrmòfū
    Readers of "Truth Daily" Bùjīn (Leningrad), Bàogédanuówèiqí (Brest), and Zháyīcǎifū (Kuslanayi Province) ask: What is capitalist encirclement and what is its current role?
    Marxism-Leninism teaches that capitalist encirclement is not a geographical concept, but a political one.
    V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin once elucidated the question of capitalist encirclement and the relationship between the two systems of capitalism and socialism.
    Based on a profound analysis of the imperialist stage of capitalism, Lenin concluded that the socialist revolution could not be victorious in all countries simultaneously. He pointed out that, due to the uneven development of capitalism and the different times of revolutionary maturity, the proletariat might first achieve victory in one or several countries. Thereafter, more and more countries would break away from the capitalist system and unite with the socialist camp. Due to these historical conditions, the long-term coexistence of two opposing systems, socialism and capitalism, is inevitable and possible.
    When arguing for the laws governing the emergence of new socialist countries and the possible coexistence of two social systems, Lenin and Stalin also pointed out the danger of capitalist encirclement, pointing out that the international bourgeoisie was doing its utmost to restore the old order in socialist countries.
    Comrade Stalin instructed in 1926: "We are in a capitalist encirclement. Our building of socialism and the revolutionizing of the working masses of capitalist countries cannot but arouse the hostile aversion of the capitalist world. It would be a fantasy to think that the capitalist world would sit idly by and watch our economic victory – a victory sufficient to revolutionize the working class of the whole world."
    Throughout the entire period after the founding of the Soviet state, the Communist Party and the government have consistently pursued a policy of peace and friendship with all nationalities, doing their utmost to protect our country from unexpected events and ensuring constant readiness to resist enemy attacks.
    In its anti-Soviet struggle, imperialism has tried all methods, such as armed attacks, economic blockades, conspiracies, sabotage, espionage, and terrorist means. However, the Soviet Union not only survived these struggles, but also became more consolidated and powerful after enduring all these arduous tests. The attempt by international reactionary forces to use Hitler's bandits to eliminate the Soviet Union also went bankrupt.
    After World War II, due to the defeat of fascist Germany and imperialist Japan, the international status of the Soviet Union underwent fundamental changes. China and many People's Democratic countries in Europe broke away from the capitalist system. These countries, together with the Soviet Union, formed a united and powerful camp of peace-loving countries, jointly defending the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism. But it must be recognized that capitalism still rules most countries in the world. Although the Soviet Union is bordered by friendly People's Democratic countries in both the West and the East, it cannot be considered that our country is no longer within capitalist encirclement.
    Capitalist encirclement exists and plays a role. For example, the fact that imperialist countries have organized aggressive alliances like the North Atlantic Group aimed at opposing the democratic camp countries, and built many military bases around the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, convincingly proves this point. The fact that the United States and other capitalist countries have stepped up sabotage activities in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries with the help of spies, saboteurs, and assassins, as well as organizing slanderous propaganda and instigation, also proves this point.
    The enemies of peace and freedom of all nations are engaged in the most despicable adventures, attempting to use all means to undermine the united and solid democratic camp, and first weaken the leadership of this camp – the Soviet Union.
    Marxism-Leninism teaches us that historical experience and the course of all events after World War II prove that the greater the victory of socialism, the sharper the contradictions in the imperialist camp, the more rampant the imperialist reactionary forces, and the more frequent the provocative activities against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries of Europe.
    Because the imperialists have not established a social base for a "fifth column" in the Soviet Union, they send many spies and saboteurs from outside, attempting to recruit various corrupt elements and traitors. In order to carry out sabotage activities in the People's Democratic countries, the enemies of peace attempt to form a gang composed of the remnants of Hitler's elements, war criminals, and traitors. The American "Newsweek" brazenly declared that the U.S. government "relies primarily on sabotage and slowdowns in its tense cold war against the Soviet Union." The "New York Herald Tribune" admitted that "the main part of psychological warfare is conducted secretly underground and in a way that gives the government the possibility of disclaiming responsibility."
    In 1952, a person named Levi Yeveluo published an article in the "National Business" (organ of the American Chamber of Commerce) magazine, saying: "Although no official admits it, we are training spies, saboteurs, and experts in psychological warfare in the most dangerous ways. Training them how to break into Russian enterprises to find out some secret; training them to destroy bridges, trains and military factories; training them to use various American and foreign weapons."
    The author also said: Few people know exactly how much money the Central Intelligence Agency spends to carry out its "cloak and dagger activities."
    The so-called "Common Security Act" passed by the United States on October 10, 1951, is an unprecedented action in international relations and a serious violation of international law. According to this bill, millions of dollars are allocated annually for espionage and sabotage work to maintain various dregs, traitors, and war criminals in order to carry out sabotage activities in democratic and socialist countries.
    The true purpose of this bill, its initiators and instigators themselves, made it very clear. For example, one of the drafters of the bill, Kelstan, openly boasted that the funds allocated under the bill were used to subsidize the underground activities of saboteurs and terrorists against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.
    In many countries, especially in West Germany and West Berlin, various espionage bases have been established with American money, including espionage and sabotage centers such as the "National Committee for the Struggle for Free Europe," which is composed of traitors expelled from various People's Democratic countries.
    For three years, according to the "Common Security Act," this evil law, various American organizations have spent hundreds of millions of dollars, openly or secretly, to fund counter-revolutionary underground activities in the countries of the People's Democratic camp. According to a United Press report on June 13, the effectiveness of this bill has been extended to Asia in addition to Europe.
    The policy of sabotage, provocation, and incitement is carried out under the false pretext of the "liberation policy" of the peoples of all countries. Not long ago, Bellingham, an extremely reactionary American, publicly declared in "This Week Magazine" that the so-called liberation policy is "what is usually considered incitement." The British magazine "New Statesman and Nation" said that without allocating millions of dollars to anti-communist underground organizations and conducting hostile propaganda, there would not have been any events in Berlin on June 17. It is no accident that the magazine pointed this out.
    The recent trial in Warsaw (especially of the bandit organization connected with the sabotage organization "Free and Independent Regiment") proved that the saboteurs and spies sent to Poland had been trained in specialized schools in West Germany. (The fascist terrorist organization "Polish Exiles Relief Committee") operates under the protection of the American authorities. The captured saboteurs declared that they were all in contact with American detectives and received money and weapons from there, and so on.
    The uncovering and elimination of various conspiracy and sabotage organizations in Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary once again illustrates the intensification of sabotage activities by American imperialists in these countries.
    According to the fascist saboteurs arrested during the June 17 provocative incident in Berlin, they had been trained and financially assisted by evil organizations established by Americans and disguised under various false names.
    American imperialists are actively engaged in sabotage activities against the People's Republic of China. Thanks to the vigilance of the Chinese people and its government organs, anti-people organizations established by the enemies of the free Chinese people have been uncovered more than once.
    All these facts and many other facts prove that capitalist encirclement is strengthening its hostile conspiracies, and imperialists are searching for people who are prepared to betray the interests of their motherland and oppose their own people.
    Recent events, especially the imperialist provocations in Berlin and their attempts to airdrop saboteurs into our country from airplanes, have repeatedly reminded the Soviet people and the working people of the People's Democratic countries that the reactionary forces of imperialism do not want to give up the illusion of eliminating the great achievements of the peoples of the democratic and socialist camp. Imperialists will continue to send their detectives, spies, and saboteurs to the countries of the socialist camp. They will use every means to harm the free people in order to hinder their peaceful construction. Therefore, we must always remember and never forget capitalist encirclement, and never forget that we must always maintain revolutionary vigilance against the conspiracies and tricks of the imperialists - the enemies of peace and socialism.
    In order to guarantee the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and protect our motherland from any unexpected events, we must constantly strengthen the power of the Soviet state and raise the revolutionary vigilance of all Soviet people.
    The Soviet state is in the hands of the working people, the main weapon for striving to build communism and organizing resistance to foreign military aggression to defend our socialist motherland. The power of the socialist state is the most important condition for the successful development of the Soviet Union. Marxism-Leninism teaches that a country where socialism has already been victorious, if it does not want to be annihilated by capitalist encirclement, should not weaken the state, but should do its utmost to strengthen the state, strengthen its armed forces and defense organs.
    The Soviet Union's foreign policy is a firm policy of defending peace among the peoples of all countries, a policy of struggling against the preparation and launching of new wars. The starting point of this policy is that if there is a desire for mutual cooperation, a willingness to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed, then peaceful coexistence between capitalism and communism is entirely possible.
    However, we must not forget the conspiracies of the international imperialist reactionary forces who are hostile to the achievements of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries and who are pregnant with plans for a new world war. Therefore, the Communist Party calls on us to show due vigilance and steadfastness in the struggle against all the tricks of our enemies - the spies of the imperialist aggressor countries.
    The Soviet people engaged in peaceful labor and the working people of the People's Democratic countries must strictly defend and fully consolidate their greatest achievements - the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, and constantly strengthen the friendship between the free peoples of all countries.

    论资本主义的包围
    苏联  哈尔拉莫夫
    “真理报”读者布金（列宁格勒）、鲍格达诺维赤（布列斯特）和札依采夫（库斯拉那依省）问：什么是资本主义包围及其现时的作用如何？
    马克思列宁主义教导说，资本主义包围不是一个地理上的概念，而是一个政治上的概念。
    弗·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林曾经阐述了关于资本主义包围的问题和资本主义与社会主义两种制度间的关系问题。
    列宁根据对资本主义的帝国主义阶段的深刻分析，得出了社会主义革命不能在所有国家同时获胜的结论，他指出，由于资本主义的不平衡发展和革命成熟时间的不同，无产阶级可能首先在一国或数国内获得胜利。此后，愈来愈多的国家将要从资本主义的制度中摆脱出来，而与社会主义阵营联结在一起。由于这些历史条件，社会主义与资本主义两个对立制度的长期共处是必然的和可能的。
    列宁和斯大林在论证新的、社会主义国家产生的规律和两种社会制度可能共处的问题时，同时指出了资本主义包围的危险，指出了国际资产阶级竭力想要在社会主义国家内恢复旧秩序。
    斯大林同志在一九二六年曾指示说：“我们是处在资本主义包围中。我们建设社会主义，使资本主义各国工人群众革命化，这种情形不能不引起资本主义世界仇视的恶感。如果以为资本主义世界会很冷淡地坐视我们在经济上的胜利——足以使全世界工人阶级革命化的胜利，这就未免是一种空想。”
    在苏维埃国家成立后的全部时期内，共产党和政府一贯执行着和平与各族人民友好的政策，竭力保卫我国不遭到意外的事件，并保证了抵抗敌人进攻的经常准备。
    帝国主义者在其反苏的斗争中，尝试过了一切方法，如武装进攻、经济封锁、阴谋活动、破坏活动、间谍活动、恐怖手段。但是，苏联在这些斗争中不仅是支持住了，而且在经受了这一切艰苦考验之后，变得更巩固和强大了。国际反动势力利用希特勒强盗来消灭苏联的企图也遭受了破产。
    在第二次世界大战以后，由于击溃了法西斯德国和帝国主义日本，苏联的国际地位起了根本的变化。中国和欧洲许多人民民主国家摆脱了资本主义体系，这些国家和苏联在一起组成了爱好和平国家的统一的和强大的阵营，共同保卫着和平、民主与社会主义事业。但是必须认识到，资本主义还统治着世界上大多数的国家。虽然苏联在西方和东方都和友好的人民民主国家为邻，但却不能认为我国就已经不在资本主义的包围之内。
    资本主义的包围是存在着并且起着作用。例如帝国主义国家组织像北大西洋集团这样旨在反对民主阵营各国的侵略联盟、在苏联与人民民主国家周围修建许多军事基地的这些事实，都具有说服力地证明了这一点。美国及其他资本主义国家借助间谍、破坏者和刺客，以及组织诬蔑宣传和挑拨，在苏联和人民民主国家加紧破坏活动，也证明了这一点。
    各国人民和平与自由的敌人正在从事最卑鄙的冒险行为、企图使用一切的办法来破坏统一而团结的民主阵营，并且首先削弱这一阵营的领导力量——苏联。
    马克思列宁主义教导我们说，历史经验和第二次世界大战后全部事变的进程证明，社会主义的胜利愈大，帝国主义阵营中的矛盾愈尖锐，那么帝国主义反动势力愈狂妄，反对苏联、中华人民共和国、欧洲人民民主国家的挑拨活动亦愈频繁。
    帝国主义者由于在苏联没有建立“第五纵队”的社会基础，便从外面派来很多的间谍和破坏分子，企图招募各种腐化分子和叛徒。为了在人民民主国家进行破坏活动起见，和平的敌人便企图由残余的希特勒分子、战犯和卖国贼组成一个匪帮。美国“新闻周报”大言不惭地宣布说，美国政府“在其反苏紧张的冷战中，首先要依靠破坏活动和怠工”。“纽约先驱论坛报”承认，“心理战的主要部分，是在地下和给政府以解除责任可能的形式下秘密进行的”。
    一九五二年有一位名叫列维叶洛的在“全国商业”（美国商会机关报）杂志上发表的一篇文章说道：“尽管任何一个官方人士都不承认这一点，但我们是在训练间谍、破坏分子和以最危险的方式进行心理战争的专家。训练他们如何打进俄国的企业去探听某种秘密；训练他们破坏桥梁、列车和军事工厂；训练他们使用美国和外国的各种武器。”
    这位作者又说：究竟中央情报局为了进行其“外套和匕首的活动”化费了多少钱，人们是很少知道的。
    一九五一年十月十日美国所通过的所谓“共同安全法”是国际关系中史无前例的行动，是对国际法规一个严重的破坏。按照这个法案，每年要拨款数百万美元来进行间谍和破坏工作，来维持各种败类、卖国贼、战犯，以便在民主与社会主义国家进行破坏活动。
    关于这个法案的真正目的，它的创议者和教唆者本人就说的非常明白。例如，该法案的制订者之一——凯尔斯坦公开地吹嘘说，根据该法案所拨款项系供津贴破坏者与恐怖分子进行反对苏联与人民民主国家的地下活动之用。
    在许多国家里，首先在西德和西柏林，用美国的钱建立了各种间谍的根据地，其中包括由各人民民主国家驱逐出去的叛徒所组成的“争取自由欧洲斗争民族委员会”这样的间谍破坏中心。
    三年来，根据“共同安全法”这个罪恶的法律，美国各种组织或明或暗地化费了数亿美元来资助在人民民主阵营各国的反革命地下活动。据美国合众社六月十三日报道，这个法案的效力除欧洲外已扩展到亚洲了。
    破坏、挑拨和煽动的政策是在各国人民的“解放政策”的虚伪的藉口下进行的。不久以前，美国的极端反动分子别林汉姆在“这一周杂志”中公开地宣称，所谓解放政策即是“通常被认为的挑拨行为”。英国杂志“新政治家与民族”说，如果不给反共的地下组织拨给数百万的美元，也不进行敌对的宣传，就不会有六月十七日在柏林的任何事件。该杂志所以指出这一点不会是偶然的。
    不久以前在华沙的审判案（特别是对和破坏组织“自由独立团”有联系的匪徒组织）中证明，派到波兰的破坏分子与间谍是在西德的专门学校内受过训练的。（法西斯的恐怖组织“波兰流亡者救济委员会”）在美国当局庇护之下进行活动。就地捕获的破坏者宣称，他们都和美国侦探有联系，并从那里领取金钱和武器等等。
    在罗马尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利各种阴谋破坏组织的破获与消灭，又一次说明了美帝国主义者在这些国家中破坏活动的加强。
    据六月十七日在柏林挑衅事件时期中所逮捕的法西斯破坏分子们供称，他们曾受过美国人所设立的、以各种虚伪名称所掩护的罪恶组织的训练和金钱的接济。
    美帝国主义者积极地进行着反对中华人民共和国的破坏活动。由于中国人民及其政府机关的警惕性，已经不止一次地破获了自由中国人民的敌人所设立的反人民组织。
    所有这些事实和其他的许多事实都证明了资本主义的包围正在加强其敌对的阴谋，帝国主义者正在搜罗准备出卖祖国利益和反对自己人民的人。
    近来的事件，首先是帝国主义者在柏林的挑拨及他们由飞机上向我国空投破坏分子的企图，都一再地使苏联人民和人民民主国家的劳动人民注意到：帝国主义的反动势力并不想放弃消灭民主与社会主义阵营各国人民的伟大成果的幻想，帝国主义者将不断地把他们侦探、间谍和破坏分子派到社会主义阵营各国，他们要用尽方法来危害自由的人民，以便阻碍他们的和平建设。因此要永远记住并且任何时候都不要忘记资本主义的包围，不要忘记必须对帝国主义者——和平与社会主义的敌人的阴谋与诡计经常保持革命警惕性。
    为了保证苏联人民的和平劳动并保卫我们祖国不遭受任何意外事件，必须经常加强苏维埃国家的威力，提高全体苏联人民的革命警惕性。
    苏维埃国家是掌握在劳动人民手中的，为争取建设共产主义和组织抵抗外来的军事进攻以保卫我们社会主义祖国的主要武器。社会主义国家的威力是苏联向前顺利发展的最重要的条件。马克思列宁主义教导说，社会主义已经取得胜利的国家，如果它不愿意被资本主义的包围所歼灭，那么就不应当削弱国家，而应当尽全力来加强国家、加强其武装力量和保卫机关。
    苏联的外交政策是各国人民间保卫和平的坚定的政策，是为反对准备和发动新战争而斗争的政策。这个政策的出发点是，如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那末资本主义与共产主义的和平共处就是十分可能的。
    但是，我们不能忘记敌视苏联与人民民主国家成就的和孕育着新世界大战计划的国际帝国主义反动势力的阴谋。因此，共产党号召我们在反对我们的敌人——帝国主义侵略国家的间谍——的所有各种诡计的斗争中要表现出应有的警惕性和坚定性。
    从事和平劳动的苏联人民和人民民主国家的劳动人民要严格地保卫和全力地巩固他们的最伟大的成果——和平、民主与社会主义阵营，不断地加强自由的各国人民间的友谊。
