How the Party Branch of the Sixth Workshop of Jiangling 031 Factory Guarantees and Supervises Production
Fan Kang

Before August 1952, the Sixth Workshop of Jiangling 031 Factory was a notorious laggard in the entire factory. Workers in other workshops said that the Sixth Workshop was "ideologically backward and had low production."

The Sixth Workshop was established in 1950. Over 90% of the workers in the workshop were transferred from other workshops, with complex ideological backgrounds and varying technical skills. The workshop had nine different types of machines, most of which had exceeded their service life. At the same time, production tasks changed frequently, the variety of products was large, and workers often rushed to produce due to special urgent tasks, and rework and waste occurred frequently, which affected output standards and wage income. In addition, the organizational strength of the Party was weak (until the autumn of 1952, there were only three Party members, and all of them were administrative management cadres), the leadership style of the cadres was poor, and the workers and the workshop leadership were not united. Therefore, the situation in the workshop seemed particularly complicated and chaotic.

Since the factory carried out Party building work in August 1952, the Sixth Workshop has absorbed some new Party members, established a workshop branch, and set up a full-time branch secretary. The responsible cadres of the workshop party organization received profound education in mass movements (especially the "Three-Anti" movement), changed their commandist working methods, strengthened the leading role of the Party, and reversed the past antagonistic emotions between workers and workshop leaders. At the same time, in the active Party building and mass movement of summarizing advanced production experience, many workers recognized their goals, and as a result, the output of the workshop increased by 40% after summarizing the work for five days. As a result, the backward situation of the Sixth Workshop has undergone a fundamental change. Some workers who were not active in the past have now become active workers or advanced producers, and backward groups have disappeared. The product quality of the entire Sixth Workshop has always been in the first place in the factory. In January of this year, because it completed the urgent production task five days, seven hours and a half ahead of schedule, and the product quality was completely up to standard, it won the honorary title of "Production Pioneer." In completing the shock production tasks in February and March, both output and quality were ranked first in the factory, and a collective bonus was awarded. Now, the Sixth Workshop has become an advanced workshop in the factory.

The fundamental reason for this leap-forward transformation of the Sixth Workshop lies in the fact that the Party Branch, under the leadership and help of the higher-level Party committee, has firmly grasped the central link of guaranteeing and supervising production, and has taken a series of correct measures around this center, resolutely implemented them to the end, and consolidatedly educated and mobilized the workers of the entire workshop.

How exactly did the Sixth Workshop Branch carry out this work? It can be summarized in the following aspects:

Grasp the ideological education work

The leading cadres of the Sixth Workshop have experienced profound education in many real-life situations, and realize that it is an unshakable principle to constantly understand the ideological situation of the masses, continuously carry out ideological education, and combine solving ideological problems with political and economic work in order to do a good job in production.

The Sixth Workshop focuses on the following three contents when conducting ideological education for workers: education on the socialist future; education on the working class being masters of their own affairs; and education on patriotism and internationalism. These educational contents are all carried out in response to the actual ideological problems existing among the workers, and ultimately lead to educating the workers to consciously strive to complete the national production plan.

The ideological education work of the Sixth Workshop Branch has several characteristics:

First, it does not talk about ideology in isolation and empty terms, but specifically starts from production to talk about ideology, and finally returns from ideology to production. That is to say: through production problems, discover ideological problems; criticize ideological problems, solve production problems. Combining ideological problems and production problems to solve them.

The current Communist Youth League Branch Secretary in the workshop, Comrade Wu Guangyin, joined the Youth League in 1950 and has consistently been an activist in various political movements. However, he has long had a major shortcoming, that is, his political enthusiasm cannot be implemented in production. Therefore, the quality of the products he produces is at the lowest level in the entire workshop, and the rework rate often accounts for 20%. Because of this serious shortcoming, his application to join the Party has been rejected many times, which has greatly stimulated him.

In order to help him recognize his shortcomings, Comrade Zhou Zhengshan, the Party Branch Secretary, had several individual talks with him, and sincerely and repeatedly pointed out to him that in the factory, political activism should first be reflected in production, and for the situation in our factory workshop, it should be specifically reflected in quality. If there are shortcomings in this regard, it cannot be said that the conditions of a Communist Party member are fully met. This kind of conversation made Comrade Wu Guangyin understand more and more deeply the consistency between political activism and production activism, and made him gradually change his previous emphasis on his own political activism and underestimate his shortcomings in production lag. Comrade Zhou Zhengshan also further explored the specific ideological reasons for Comrade Wu Guangyin's poor product quality. Because the factory implements a piece-rate wage system, Comrade Wu Guangyin undertakes a relatively large amount of mass work, which more or less affects his actual production time. At the same time, the family burden is relatively heavy, so in order to get more wages, he hurriedly pursued output, but relaxed the study of quality, so the resulting defective products are quite numerous. Comrade Zhou Zhengshan criticized his thinking of only considering himself, and at the same time, on behalf of the Party, put forward specific action goals to him, requiring him to do a good job in quality, closely contact the masses, and correct his impatience and subjective faults, otherwise, joining the Party would be out of the question. About two months after the conversation, Wu Guangyin actively improved his work, so that the product quality completely met the specifications, without defective products and waste products; there was also an improvement in the relationship with the masses. Therefore, in December 1952, he gloriously joined the Communist Party.

Second, instead of carrying out ideological work in a "one day of sunshine, ten days of frost" manner, it is necessary to conduct ideological mapping and ideological education frequently and informally to meet the requirements of the work, so that ideological work can play its due combat role in actual production.

The responsible comrades of the Sixth Workshop Branch deeply understand that people's ideological activities are constantly changing. Even if the basic ideological problems are solved, it does not mean that all ideological problems are solved. With the development of work, new ideological problems will often arise. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt continuous ideological mapping and ideological education. Every time the Sixth Workshop studies how to implement the work instructions of the higher-level Party committee, it first arranges backbone members to collect the ideological situation of the workers through various organizations, classify the workers according to their ideological situation (how many are relatively active? How many are in the middle? How many are relatively backward?), and refer to these situations to find out the changing situations and laws; then arrange the backbone members to study several major ideological problems among them, and assign special personnel to solve the problems of typical backward elements. After the workers are unified ideologically, the movement can be promoted smoothly and without hindrance. The Sixth Workshop adopted this working method very effectively in the shock production campaign in January of this year and in the recent "Three Checks" and "Four Determinations."

Third, cultivate typical examples, set an example, and educate all workers. And focus on publicizing and promoting advanced operating methods, and educating workers to establish advanced production ideas.

The Sixth Workshop Branch always focuses on two aspects when cultivating "typical examples": one is to select advanced individuals and groups, so that they can first create practical and feasible experience in overcoming difficulties and responding to the call of higher authorities; the other is to select the relatively backward parts in the movement and concentrate their efforts on solving their problems in a certain period. Once these two problems are solved, all ideological problems of the same type will be solved quickly, and the Party's call will soon form a mass movement. For example, Wu Guangyin's technical level belonged to the lowest level in the workshop (Grade 1 worker), but because he was diligent in learning and researching, he finally changed the situation of constant rework. The introduction of this typical example greatly stimulated and encouraged other workers.

In addition, the Sixth Workshop Branch also pays attention to using various opportunities to conduct ideological education. As Branch Secretary Zhou Zhengshan often said: "Seize the opportunity to educate!"

Adopt the method of serial connection to educate the masses

When educating and mobilizing workers, the Sixth Workshop Branch universally adopts and adheres to the method of serial connection: first, it is to create mass serial connection through activists. One connects one or two, two connect three or four, and so on, constantly expanding the circle of serial connection, so that more and more workers in the entire workshop are absorbed into the scope of serial connection; second, it is to use advanced ideas to influence and overcome backward ideas; and to launch universal mass self-education.

There are also two ways of serial connection: one is more frequent and long-term; the other is more temporary. The former is mainly used in daily production work, and the latter is mainly used in shock work or movements.

Frequent serial connections are mostly from Party members to mutual aid groups, and then from mutual aid groups to the masses. The mutual aid group is an organization generally established by the Party Committee of Jiangling 031 Factory in order to educate and cultivate Party building objects. The leader of the Party group also serves as the leader of the mutual aid group. The probationary Party members in the Party group (who account for a relatively large proportion of the number of Party members) all participate in the mutual aid group and study together with activists; at the same time, under the leadership of the branch, each person is responsible for regularly cultivating and educating two development objects, and after the cultivation and education has a certain effect, they guide them to choose several general or relatively backward workers to carry out serial connection. Then, they guide these serially connected masses to serially connect to other masses.... This method of serial connection not only examines the ideological awareness and mass work ability of the activists, but also enhances the Party's education of the workers.

The Sixth Workshop Branch successfully used this serial connection method in the work of transforming the Luo Guangzhong group from a relatively backward group to an advanced group. Before the transformation, the Luo Guangzhong group was a well-known backward group in the entire workshop. There were five people in their group at that time, and relatively backward elements accounted for three, and the remaining two were still middle-of-the-roaders. There was no Party member or Youth League member in the group. Although Luo Guangzhong was the union group leader, his awareness was not high. He felt that he had a set of "skills", but he was very dissatisfied because he did not get much money. He often confronted the activists in the workshop and took the lead in not participating in learning, and did not control the meeting place when the group met. Because he was not focused on production, defective products often accounted for 10% to 20% of all products. When the inspector asked him to rework, he glared and quarreled.

The branch connected with Xiao Fuguo, who usually "got along" with Luo Guangzhong, to carry out serial connection. After accepting this task from the branch in the mutual aid group, Xiao Fuguo first went deep into Luo Guangzhong's dormitory to strengthen his emotional connection with Luo Guangzhong in life. Then, according to Luo Guangzhong's level of awareness, he gradually inspired Luo Guangzhong to talk about his ideological problems, and then patiently pointed out Luo Guangzhong's shortcomings in not paying attention to product quality. It turned out that Luo Guangzhong had progressive requirements. He said: "I still want to make progress, but I don't know how to make progress." At this time, Xiao Fuguo expressed his willingness to help him regularly and arranged for him to make a self-criticism of his past mistakes in the group; when Luo Guangzhong showed progressive performance, he was officially assigned to take on the task of serial connection. After such a serial connection movement, the remaining workers in the group were transformed into active workers. Soon the product quality of the whole group reached 100%, and the group that was known for quarreling in the past has been completely transformed.

Temporary serial connection is carried out around the current central task. For example, at the beginning of the movement to summarize advanced production experience, the Sixth Workshop Branch held a meeting of Party and League members and backbone members. It was arranged that each person attending the meeting should connect with two activists. After accepting this task from the branch, everyone chose serial connection objects according to their own conditions, understood their ideological situation, actively assisted them in solving some practical problems that were urgent and could be solved; and often conducted patient individual talks to promote their progress day by day.

The serial connection work of the Sixth Workshop has the following experiences: First, the serial connection person must be willing to spend time (mainly rest time) to get along with the serially connected person in life and establish the necessary emotional connection. Second, find out the ideological details and take the initiative to solve some practical problems that must and can be solved. Third, try to use your own transformation examples and exemplary actions to influence others. Fourth, carry out political education concretely from near to far and from small to large. Fifth, when you find that the person being serially connected has made a little progress, affirm and encourage them; and dare to use them as activists to a certain extent.

Rely on Party and League backbones to carry out production propaganda

The reason why the Sixth Workshop Branch has achieved great success is inseparable from the fact that the branch closely relies on the Party and League backbones, gives play to the organizational role, and carries out production propaganda. The Party organization of the Sixth Workshop pays great attention to giving play to the role of various organizations in the workshop. A coordination meeting system has been established in daily leadership, a core group has been established in the trade union, and the branch often sends cadres to go deep into the groups to help with work. After accepting new tasks, the branch first relies on the Party and League backbones, requires them to play a core role in various organizations, mobilizes the masses, and strives to complete the tasks in a certain period. The same is true in general serial connection work and other work.

The Sixth Workshop Branch formulates individual action plans according to the requirements of Party and League members' work and personal conditions. The content includes production, serial connection, learning, and other aspects. After this plan is studied and approved by the Party or League group, it becomes the direction and goal of each Party member and League member's efforts in a certain period. The group can check their work according to the plan. Now many Party members and League members reflect that "they know what to do every day."

The Sixth Workshop has more than 20 Party propaganda workers. Under the specific leadership of the branch propaganda committee member, a set of propaganda institutions has been established. This institution includes the following groups: the communication and publishing group, the propaganda and mobilization group, the literature and entertainment group, the skill group, and the spare-time education group. These organizations have generally played their due role. For example, big-character posters and blackboard newspapers in the workshop often carry out propaganda in coordination with the central work. Now the entire workshop can receive about 200 articles from workers every month. The role of the skill group is also quite large. They have studied three skills to save raw materials, which have been promoted throughout the factory. The propaganda work of the Sixth Workshop has become mass propaganda work.

Whenever the Sixth Workshop Branch accepts a task or launches a movement, it always explains the significance and specific methods to the propaganda personnel in advance in an appropriate form. Therefore, they can walk in front of the masses in propaganda and play the role of encouraging the masses and guiding production. In addition, the branch propaganda committee member regularly checks the work of the propaganda workers and helps to solve some difficult problems specifically. And hold regular meetings to exchange experience. Therefore, the propaganda work of the Sixth Workshop has always been carried out under leadership and effectively.

    江零三一工厂第六车间党支部是怎样保证和监督生产的
    范康
    在一九五二年八月以前，江零三一工厂第六车间，是全厂有名的落后车间。其他车间的工人都说第六车间是：“思想落后，生产不高”。
    第六车间是一九五○年成立的。全车间百分之九十以上的工人都是由别的车间调来的，工人的思想情况复杂、技术也参差不齐。全车间共有九种不同的机器，大多数是超过了使用期限。同时，生产任务经常改变，产品种类多，工人经常因特殊紧迫的任务而突击生产，也经常发生返工浪费现象，所以影响产量标准，也影响工资收入。加上党的组织力量薄弱，（直到一九五二年秋天，只有三个党员，而且都是行政管理干部。）干部的领导作风不好，工人群众和车间领导也不团结，因此，车间情况就显得特别复杂和混乱。
    一九五二年八月全厂进行建党工作以来，第六车间吸收了一些新党员，成立了车间支部，设立了专职的支部书记。车间党组织的负责干部在群众运动
    （尤其是“三反”运动）中受到深刻的教育，改变了强迫命令的工作方法，加强了党的领导作用，扭转了过去工人群众与车间领导的对立情绪。同时，在积极建党及群众性的总结先进生产经验运动中，很多工人认清了奋斗目标，因而车间在总结工作五天以后产量提高了百分之四十。于是，第六车间的落后情况就发生了根本的改变。过去一些不积极的工人，现在都变成了积极工作者或先进生产者了，落后小组也绝迹了。整个第六车间的产品质量一直在全厂占着第一的地位。今年一月份，因为提前五天零七小时半完成了紧急的生产任务，产品质量完全合乎规格，而得到了“生产先锋”的光荣称号。二、三月间在完成突击生产任务中，产量、质量上都列为全厂第一，获得了集体奖金。现在，第六车间成了全厂的先进车间了。
    第六车间这个飞跃的转变，根本原因在于党支部在上级党委的领导和帮助下，紧紧抓住保证与监督生产这一中心环节，并围绕这一中心采取了一系列的正确措施，毫不懈怠地贯彻到底，巩固地教育和发动了全车间的工人群众。
    第六车间支部究竟是怎样具体进行这种工作呢？归纳起来有以下几个方面：
    抓紧思想教育工作
    第六车间的领导干部经历了多次的现实生活的深刻教育，认识到经常了解群众的思想情况，不断进行思想教育，并把解决思想问题和政治工作经济工作结合起来，是搞好生产不可动摇的原则。
    第六车间对工人进行思想教育时着重下面三个内容：这就是社会主义前途的教育；工人阶级当家作主的教育；爱国主义与国际主义的教育。这些教育内容都是针对着工人中实际存在的思想问题进行，最后都归结到教育工人自觉地为完成国家生产计划而奋斗。
    第六车间支部的思想教育工作有几个特点：
    第一、不是孤立地空洞地谈思想，而是具体地从生产谈到思想，最后又从思想归结到生产。也就是：通过生产问题，发现思想问题；批判思想问题，解决生产问题。把思想问题和生产问题结合起来解决。
    现在车间里的团支部书记吴光银同志，在一九五零年就参加了青年团，在历次政治运动中一贯是积极分子。但是，他长期存在一个最大的缺点，就是他在政治上的积极性不能贯彻到生产中去。所以他生产的产品质量是属于全车间最低的水平，返工率常占百分之二十。由于他存在着这个严重缺点，所以多次申请入党，都没有被党所接受，这给他的刺激很大。
    党支部书记周正山同志为了帮助他认识自己的缺点，找他作了多次个别的谈话，并诚恳地反复地向他指出：在工厂里，政治积极应当首先表现在生产上，对我们厂里车间的情况来说，又应当具体地表现在质量上面。如果这上面有缺点，就不能说是完全具备了共产党员的条件。这种谈话使得吴光银同志越来越深刻地懂得了政治积极和生产积极的一致性，使他逐渐改变了以前看重自己政治积极的优点，低估了自己生产落后的缺点。周正山同志还从吴光银同志的产品质量差这个问题，进一步发掘他的具体思想原因。因为厂里实行的是计件工资制，吴光银同志担当的群众工作比较多，或多或少地影响了他的实际生产时间。同时家庭负担又比较重，他为了得到较多的工资，就匆匆忙忙追求产量，而放松了对质量的钻研，因此产生的次品就相当多。周正山同志批判了他这种只为个人打算的思想，同时代表党向他提出具体的行动目标，要求他搞好质量，密切联系群众，纠正急躁、主观等毛病，要不然就谈不上入党。经过谈话以后约两个月，吴光银就积极改进自己的工作，使产品质量完全合乎了规格，没有次品和废品；在和群众关系上也有了改进。因此在一九五二年十二月，他光荣地参加了共产党。
    第二、不是“一曝十寒”的进行思想工作，而是经常地、不拘形式地适应工作要求进行思想摸底和思想教育，使思想工作在生产实际中发挥应有的战斗性。
    第六车间支部的负责同志深深了解：人们的思想活动是经常有着各种变化的，即使在基本思想问题上面解决了，也并不等于一切思想问题都解决了。随着工作的发展，经常会出现新的思想问题。因此，必须采取不断的思想摸底和进行思想教育。第六车间每次研究如何贯彻上级党委的工作指示时，首先布置骨干分子，通过各种组织收集工人群众的思想情况，按思想情况将工人分类排队（比较积极的多少？中间的多少？比较落后的多少？），参照这些情况，从中发现变化的情况和规律；然后布置骨干分子对其中几个主要的思想问题进行研究，并指定专人去解决典型落后分子的问题。等到工人们在思想上统一起来后，运动就可以顺利无阻地推行了。在今年一月份的突击生产运动中以及在最近的“三查”“四定”中，第六车间采取了这样工作方法很有成效。
    第三、培养典型，做出榜样，教育全体工人。并着重宣传推广先进的操作方法，教育工人树立先进的生产思想。
    第六车间支部对“典型”的培养每次都是从两头选择重点：一头是选择先进的个人和小组，使之在克服困难、响应上级号召上首先创造出切实可行的经验；另一头则选择运动中的比较落后的部分，在一定时期集中精力解决他们的问题。这两头问题
    一解决，所有同一类型的思想问题，也会很快得到解决，并很快使党的号召形成群众运动。例如吴光银的技术水平在车间是属于最低一级的（一级工），但由于他勤于学习和钻研，终于改变了一贯返工的状况。这一典型事迹的介绍，对其他工人的刺激与鼓舞很大。
    此外，第六车间支部还注意到利用各种机会，进行思想教育。正如支部书记周正山常说的：“抓住机会就教育！”
    采用连环串连方法教育群众
    在教育、发动工人时，第六车间支部普遍地采用和坚持了串连的方法：第一、是通过积极分子造成群众性的连环的串连。一个串一两个，两个串三四个，这样不断地扩大串连的圈子，因而使全车间的工人群众越来越多地被吸收到串连的范围里；第二、是运用先进思想去影响和克服落后思想；发动普遍性的群众自我教育。
    串连的方式也有两种：一种是比较经常的、长期的；另一种是比较临时性的。前者主要用于日常的生产工作中，后者主要用于突击的工作或运动中。
    经常性的串连，大多是通过由党员到互助组，再由互助组到群众。互助组是江零三一工厂党委为了教育、培养建党对象而普遍建立的一种组织。由党小组长兼任互助组组长。党小组内的候补党员（他们在党员数量中所占的比重颇大）都参加到互助组，和积极分子一道学习；同时在支部的领导下，每人负责经常培养教育两个为发展对象，并且在培养教育收到一定的效果之后，又指导他们自己选择几个一般的或比较落后的工人，进行串连。然后，又指导这些被串连的群众去向其他的群众串连……。这样的串连方式一方面考查了积极分子的思想觉悟程度和群众工作能力，同时，也增强党对工人群众的教育。
    第六车间支部在把罗光忠小组从比较落后小组转变成先进小组的工作上，就成功地运用了这种串连方式。罗光忠小组在没有转变以前，是全车间有名的落后小组。他们全组那时一共有五个人，比较落后的分子就占了三个，其余两个也还是中间分子，组内没有一个党员或团员。罗光忠虽然是工会小组长，但是觉悟并不高。他自己觉得有一套“技术”，因为拿的钱不多，很不满意。他经常和车间里的积极分子对抗，自己带头不参加学习，小组开会也不掌握会场。由于他不安心生产，次品常常占全部产品百分之十到百分之二十，检查员要他返工重做，他就瞪眼睛吵闹。
    支部通过平常和罗光忠“合得来”的萧富国去进行串连。萧富国在互助组内接受支部的这个任务后，首先深入到罗光忠的宿舍里，加强他和罗光忠在生活上感情上的联系。然后根据罗光忠的觉悟程度，一步一步地启发罗光忠谈出自己的思想问题，然后再耐心地指出罗光忠不注意产品质量的缺点。原来罗光忠是有着进步要求的，他说：“我还是想进步，但不晓得怎样进步。”这时，萧富国表示愿意经常帮助他，布置他在小组内对自己过去的错误作
    一次检讨；在罗光忠有了进步表现时，又正式分配他担负串连的任务。经过这样的串连运动，小组里的其余工人，都转变成积极工作者了。不久全组的产品质量达到了百分之百，过去那个以吵闹闻名的小组已经面貌全新了。
    临时性的串连是围绕当前中心任务进行的。例如在总结先进生产经验运动开始时，第六车间支部开了一次党团员与骨干分子会议。布置到会的人每人串连两个积极分子。大家接受支部这个任务之后，都按自己条件择定了串连对象，了解他们的思想情况，主动协助他们解决一些迫切需要而又可能解决的实际问题；并经常进行耐心的个别谈话，推动他们日益前进。
    六车间的串连工作有着下面几点经验：第一、串连人必须肯花时间（主要是休息时间）去和被串连者在生活上打成一片，建立必要的感情联系。第二、摸清思想底细，主动去解决一些必须与可能解决的实际问题。第三、尽量要用自己的转变事例和模范行动去影响别人。第四、由近而远，由小而大地去具体进行政治教育。第五、当发现被串连的人有一点进步时要给以肯定和鼓励；并在一定程度时，敢于当作积极分子加以使用。
    依靠党团骨干，开展生产宣传
    第六车间支部工作之所以获得很大的成绩，是与支部紧密地依靠党、团员骨干分子，发挥组织作用，开展生产宣传分不开的。第六车间的党组织很注意发挥车间里各个组织的作用。在日常领导上建立了碰头会制度，在工会中建立了核心小组，支部并经常派干部深入小组帮助工作。支部在接受新任务后，首先依靠党、团员骨干分子，要求他们在各个组织中发挥核心作用，发动群众，为完成一定时期的任务而奋斗。在一般的串连工作和其他工作中，也是如此。
    第六车间支部按照党、团员工作的要求、个人条件，订立个人的行动计划，内容包括生产、串连、学习及其他等，这种计划经过党的或团的小组研究通过后，就变成了每个党员、团员在一定时期的努力方向和目标，小组可以根据计划去检查他们的工作。现在有不少的党、团员反映“每天作什么心里都有数了”。
    第六车间共有二十多个党的宣传员，在支部宣传委员具体领导下，建立了一套宣传机构，这个机构包括这样几个组：即通讯出版组、宣传鼓动组、文艺文娱组、窍门组、业余教育组。这些组织一般地都发挥了应有的作用。例如车间里的大字报、黑板报就经常配合中心工作进行宣传，现在全车间每个月可以从工人中收到来稿两百篇左右。窍门组的作用也相当的大。他们曾研究了三个节省原材料的窍门，在全厂范围内得到了推广。第六车间的宣传工作已成为群众性的宣传工作了。
    第六车间支部每当接受一项任务或者开展一个运动时，都是通过适当的形式在事先向宣传人员讲明意义和具体做法。所以，他们在宣传中能够走在群众前面，发挥了鼓舞群众和指导生产的作用。此外，支部宣传委员经常检查宣传员的工作，具体帮助解决一些困难问题。并按期举行例会，交流经验。因此，第六车间宣传工作一直是在有领导有成效的情况下进行的。
