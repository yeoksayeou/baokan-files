Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th: Today, the returned personnel from our side, filled with excitement and indignation, walked towards the embrace of the motherland, bringing back more than a dozen martyrs' memorial crowns. After the repatriation trucks stopped in the exchange area, the returning personnel solemnly stepped off the trucks, holding the martyrs' memorial crowns in their hands. Under the crowns adorned with white paper flowers were affixed black or white paper strips, on which were written the time of the martyrs' martyrdom and a brief account of their ordeal. Among them, thirteen memorial crowns represent the 445 captured personnel from our side who were brutally murdered in the prisoner-of-war camps on Longcao Island and Fengyan Island from May 28, 1952, to June 6, 1953, for firmly demanding repatriation. The returning personnel said, "The martyrs sacrificed heroically to demand their return to the motherland, and we will never forget them."

The returning personnel also accused the other side of the persecution carried out after the signing of the armistice agreement to continue to forcibly detain our captured personnel. According to returning personnel Li Xuanyi and Nan Haoji, from 1:00 PM on July 27th to the evening of July 29th, the entire personnel of the 14th Prisoner of War Camp on Geoje Island demanded that the US military authorities immediately release our captured personnel who were unreasonably detained. The US military authorities not only did not accept their reasonable demands, but also brutally massacred 14 of our captured personnel with weapons such as poison gas bombs, grenades, machine guns, and bayonets, seriously injuring more than 200 people. According to another returning person, Zhao Wenbin, at 3:00 PM on July 28th, the US military also escorted 102 people from the 8th Prisoner of War Camp on Jeju Island, falsely accusing them of being "war criminals" and forcibly imprisoning them in concentration camps with four layers of barbed wire, refusing to repatriate them.

The returning personnel from our side were still subjected to inhumane torment by the US side during their repatriation journey. The six hundred Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel who returned today were even deprived of the freedom to breathe fresh air on the ship. Every sixty of them were crammed into a cramped and dark cabin, and more than half of them fainted. They departed from Jeju Island at 7:00 AM on August 3rd and arrived in our area at 10:00 AM on August 7th, a total of ninety-nine hours, during which they only ate five and a half meals of undercooked food. After eating a meal at 5:00 PM on August 4th, all 120 people in the first and fifth cabins experienced vomiting, diarrhea, limb paralysis, and blue faces, with 40 people losing their ability to speak until they gradually woke up on the morning of the 5th.

Among the 352 sick and wounded personnel who returned today, the most striking were the 30 seriously injured and ill and the 29 mentally ill patients. These seriously injured and ill people were mostly emaciated and on the verge of death, appearing even more pale and weak in the bright sunlight. Many who were classified as ordinary patients had also been amputated and became permanently disabled. A Volunteer Army captured personnel named Ping Shan from the first Busan prisoner-of-war camp originally had only a small piece of shrapnel in his back, but the US personnel deliberately opened a cut more than a foot long on his waist and removed two perfectly good ribs. These people should have been repatriated as early as April this year, but due to the unreasonable detention by the US side, their suffering was aggravated. As the trucks carrying them bypassed the mountains several miles away and advanced towards our receiving station, they began to sing songs on the trucks. As soon as the doors opened, everyone raised their thin hands, waving their own handmade flags of the victorious motherland. Even those who could not walk did so.

### 被遣返的我方人员控诉美方的残暴迫害

    被遣返的我方人员控诉美方的残暴迫害
    【新华社开城七日电】今天被遣返的我方归来人员，怀着激昂和愤慨的心情走向祖国的怀抱，并带回了十多顶烈士遗冠。遣送卡车停在交接区以后，双手捧着烈士遗冠的归来人员肃穆地走下卡车，在缀有白纸花的遗冠下，贴着黑布条或白纸条，上边写着烈士殉难的时间和简单经过。其中十三顶遗冠代表着从一九五二年五月二十八日至一九五三年六月六日，在龙草岛和蜂岩岛战俘营中坚决要求遣返而惨遭杀害的我方四百四十五位被俘人员。我方归来人员说：“烈士们是为了要求返回祖国而英勇牺牲的，我们永远不能忘记他们。”
    归来人员还控诉了对方在停战协定签字后为继续强迫扣留我方被俘人员而进行的迫害行为。据归来人员李铉义和南浩极说，在七月二十七日下午一时起到二十九日晚上的连续三天内，巨济岛第十四战俘营的全体人员要求美军当局立即释放无理扣押的我方被俘人员，美军当局不但不接受他们的合理要求，反而蛮横地用毒气弹、手榴弹、机枪、刺刀等武器屠杀我方被俘人员十四人，重伤二百多人。据另一位归来人员赵文斌说，七月二十八日下午三时，美军又从济州岛第八战俘营押走一百零二人，诬蔑他们是“战犯”，强迫关在设有四道铁丝网的集中营里不予遣返。
    我方归来人员在被遣返途中，仍然受着美方非人道的折磨。今天归来的六百名中国人民志愿军被俘人员，在轮船上连呼吸新鲜空气的自由也被剥夺了。他们每六十人挤在一个狭小阴暗的船舱里，曾有一半以上的人昏倒了。他们从八月三日上午七时由济州岛出发至七日上午十时到达我区，前后长达九十九个钟头，只吃过五顿半生不熟的饭。第一船舱和第五船舱的一百二十人在八月四日下午五时吃过一顿饭以后的七小时，全体人员上吐下泻，四肢麻痹，脸发青色，其中四十个人失去语言能力，直到五日上午才逐渐清醒。
    今天归来的三百五十二个病伤人员中，最引人注意的是三十名重伤重病者和二十九名精神病患者。这些重伤重病者大都骨瘦如柴，奄奄一息，在明朗的阳光下，更显得面黄无力。许多被列为普通病人的，也被截肢，成了终身残废。釜山第一战俘营的一位名叫平山的志愿军被俘人员，他的背上原来只有一小块弹片，美方人员故意在他腰上开了个长达一尺多的刀口，拿出了好好的两条肋骨。这些人早在今年四月就应该遣返了，但由于美方的无理扣留，以致加重了他们的痛苦。当运载他们的卡车绕过数里以外的山头而向我方接收站前进时，他们就在车上唱起歌来。车门一打开，每人都举着干瘦的手，摇动着自己做的各种各样的标志着胜利的祖国国旗，连不能走动的人都是如此。
