    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Experience in Conducting Ideological Work Among Design Personnel
    Communist Party of China Anshan Municipal Committee
    Editor's Note: The design tasks for 1953 have been basically completed, and the design for 1954 is about to begin. All design units should seize this opportunity, and through work inspection, summarize experience, and criticize mistakes, to improve the ideological and technical level of design, and ensure better completion of the design tasks for 1954. For this reason, we are introducing the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in conducting ideological work among design personnel for your reference.
    All technical personnel and staff of the Design Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company conducted an ideological construction movement last winter and this spring. Through this movement, the leadership clarified that the purpose of carrying out political work in the design department is to complete the design tasks; and that ideological transformation of design personnel is an important guarantee for doing a good job in design work. Through this movement, the awareness of technical personnel and staff has been raised, a correct design ideology has been initially established, it has been recognized that learning from the Soviet Union is the key to doing design work well, and importance has been attached to collecting original data. Issues such as economic accounting, advanced quotas, and overall concepts have begun to be considered in the design. During the movement, everyone discussed the annual design plan, criticized conservative ideas, and the revised plan saved more than 50,000 workdays compared to the original plan; each section formulated plans to listen to lectures by Soviet experts, and actively studied and implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts using methods such as recording charts. In addition, 33 party members were developed during the movement.
    The main experiences of this movement are:
    1.  Ideological education for design personnel must be combined with actual work. At the beginning, the Design Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company did not have a sufficient understanding of this, and demanded that class boundaries be clarified, relationships be explained, and the thinking of "three major enemies" be eliminated during the movement. They mechanically applied the practices of ideological transformation in universities and colleges at that time, and carried out criticism of certain people as "key points." As a result, the movement took a detour, not only causing great ideological fluctuations and failing to promote the current actual work, but also making it impossible to carry out the movement in depth, and the leadership fell into a passive position. Later, the leadership studied this situation, studied the instructions of the Northeast Bureau and the People's Daily editorial and other documents, and clarified that the most important problems in the design department at present are that the design personnel have bourgeois conservative and backward technical viewpoints, are irresponsible in their work, and do not learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. For example, the design of the weighing car for No. 8 blast furnace, the No. 8 blast furnace system, and the Dagushan substation and other projects, due to the above reasons, produced many errors, causing extremely serious losses to the country. Therefore, they promptly changed the leadership method, and decided to adopt the method of summarizing work, affirming achievements, exposing shortcomings, and criticizing various erroneous ideas. On the one hand, they arranged to study documents to make everyone realize the important significance of ideological construction, and on the other hand, they enlightened everyone to consciously examine the shortcomings, errors, and causes in their work, organized informal discussions, and carried out analysis and criticism.
    After changing the leadership method of the movement, everyone felt that ideological construction had a great relationship with their work, eliminated concerns, and the movement unfolded smoothly.
    2.  Select typical designs, enlighten consciousness, and carry out criticism and self-criticism.
    After a period of exploration, the department concentrated its efforts on inspecting the weighing car project of No. 8 blast furnace, creating experience and setting an example for the entire department. The main methods were: to understand the ideological activities of the design personnel from the design process; and then grasp the dominant ideology that caused the errors to carry out enlightenment and education. During the inspection, first clarify the general content of the engineering design, the objective environment and conditions at that time, the entire design process, the losses caused by design errors, and the reasons for the errors. (Generally, at the beginning of the inspection, do not simply accuse errors and their consequences, so as not to cause unnecessary concerns.) After such an inspection, a series of erroneous facts were exposed, such as the design personnel's refusal to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, not accepting the opinions of workers, and being irresponsible in their work. For example, Bai Yinzhang, the engineer in charge of the design, was unwilling to accept this task from the beginning, disliked the trouble, and handed it over to engineer Sun Kaifan; engineer Sun Kaifan also hated repairing broken cars, believing that repairing broken cars never required design, so he handed the task to a technician who had never done a complete design. When selecting design materials, they did not use the complete set of weighing car drawings designed by the Soviet Union, but designed based on eighty-two old drawings left over from the puppet Manchukuo. When the errors of the weighing car had been discovered by the workers, the design personnel not only did not humbly consider the opinions of the workers, but instead used so-called "theoretical basis" and "calculation formulas" to block the mouths of the workers, and rejected the rationalization proposals of the workers. In this way, linking the entire design process to everyone's ideological activities, enlightened everyone to realize the dominant ideology that caused the errors.
    Secondly, it is necessary to understand the technical problems in the design. Through typical examples, using the method of good and bad comparison, criticize various erroneous design ideas. In the inspection of the weighing car project, the unreasonable lever design was seized and made a clear comparison with the Soviet sector gear: the unreasonable lever design required 425 horsepower to lift a 25-ton material tank; while two apprentice technicians adopted the Soviet weighing car sector gear rotation method, which only required 30 horsepower. This kind of comparison aroused debate, exposed more ideological problems, seriously studied the advanced design experience of the Soviet Union, distinguished right from wrong, and attracted the masses to deeply criticize the erroneous design ideas from exposing the erroneous facts. This kind of realistic enlightenment and criticism has great persuasive power among the masses and has a profound impact.
    Finally, to carry out ideological education for technical personnel, it is also necessary to resolutely implement the principle of enlightening consciousness. The specific methods adopted by the department are: 1. Before carrying out criticism and self-criticism, leading cadres should take the lead in reviewing their own shortcomings and the responsibilities they should bear. Because the quality of design work is inseparable from the correctness of leadership, and at the same time, doing so can eliminate everyone's concerns. 2. Beforehand, enlighten the main design personnel separately. When summarizing a problem, convene relevant personnel to hold discussions, not afraid of fragmentary details, do not criticize bluntly first, remind each other to recall, clarify the facts, and then summarize several problems, guide the discussion, and unfold criticism. When there are differences of opinion, unfold debate, make a conclusion after resolving them, and then guide everyone to conduct self-examination in connection with themselves. 3. Organize technical personnel to visit the projects that failed to be repaired due to design errors and the projects with low quality, invite worker representatives to make reports, so that everyone realizes that design must be combined with reality, face the site, and listen to the opinions of the masses. This approach is extremely vivid and profound for everyone's education.
    After gaining experience in inspecting the weighing car project, the leadership promptly summarized and promoted it, pointing out that combining ideological construction with actual work is necessary and correct. Taking the No. 8 blast furnace system engineering design section as the key point, they guided everyone to conduct extensive inspections and exposures of design errors and erroneous design ideas of design personnel. During the movement, a total of 261 major design errors were exposed, and the losses caused by various errors were estimated to be 42 billion yuan. Various erroneous ideas have been vigorously criticized.
    These erroneous ideas can be summarized into the following six types:
    1. Conservative and backward thinking that refuses to accept and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Some people still miss the backward technologies of Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan, and doubt the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; some people say that they want to learn the advanced technology of the Soviet Union in words, but in reality, they still design according to old drawings and materials; or they use the excuse that "the task is too urgent, and there is not enough time to learn from the Soviet Union," and want to "do it first and then learn"; or they lack the spirit of hard work and cannot understand the advanced nature of Soviet experience; some blindly copy it rashly without conforming to the specific situation; some do not use their brains, and ask experts for everything, regardless of the size of the problem; a few serious ones are outwardly compliant but inwardly defiant, nodding in agreement to Soviet experts in person, but doing things according to their old ways behind their backs. These erroneous ideas are exposed through summarizing work, and everyone is guided to conduct in-depth analysis and criticism. For example, the foundation of the three-recovery blower project was reworked due to not accepting the suggestions of Soviet experts, delaying the construction period by four months and wasting seven tons of cement and 300 man-days.
    2. Lack of the idea of serving the working class and underestimating the labor and creation of the working masses. Some design personnel hold the attitude that everything will be fine with the drawings in hand, and have a very insufficient understanding of the design serving construction and construction serving production. They do not consider the conditions of worker safety, labor protection, and welfare and hygiene. For example, the second scrubber room was designed without toilets, rest rooms, first aid stations, and ventilation equipment, but the small house used by the Japanese puppets to monitor workers was retained. On the other hand, they do not humbly accept the suggestions of workers, and do not believe in the labor experience of the masses, thinking that the suggestions of workers are "blind people telling fortunes" and "hindsight," so many correct suggestions made by workers are rejected by the design personnel with weapons such as "design formulas" and "theoretical basis." The design of the Dagushan substation wasted 2.3 billion yuan because it did not accept the suggestions of workers.
    3. Lack of a scientific attitude of investigation and research and seeking truth from facts, and universal neglect of original data. Engineers believe that collecting original data is the job of junior technicians, and technicians believe that this is not technical work, and doing these things is a "waste of talent" and "cannot learn technology." As a result, no one is responsible for collecting data; no one has any idea about what content to collect and what requirements to meet; no one reviews whether the working methods are correct and whether the data has use value; the design is perfunctory and relies solely on subjective speculation, resulting in many errors. Among the 261 major errors exposed, 60 were due to failure to attach importance to the collection of design data, which shows the severity of the problem.
    4. Lack of economic accounting thinking. Some people disregard economic accounting in order to show themselves; some do not make long-term plans and only seek immediate convenience; some would rather spend more money to save trouble and do not consider whether they are wasting state funds; some are afraid that the project will not be safe and they will be responsible, so they arbitrarily increase the safety factor. For example, the original four concrete pillars of the Gongchangling ore storage tank were available, but the design personnel believed that this would require collecting data for investigation, etc., and it would be easier to redesign a new one, so they disregarded the waste of state funds.
    5. Irresponsible work attitude. For example, the person in charge of the design abandoned leadership, the product was not reviewed by anyone, and errors could not be corrected in time, resulting in poor design quality and many other errors.
    6. A few design personnel still have the idea of technical private ownership, mutual contempt, and mutual attack.
    The experience of this movement proves that the method of exposing and criticizing erroneous ideas through inspecting work and seeking truth from facts is an effective and correct approach. This not only guides the design personnel to realize the importance of their responsibilities, and to be determined to expose errors and criticize erroneous ideas, but more importantly, it enables them to truly learn lessons from their thinking, correct errors, give play to their enthusiasm, and do their work better. At the same time, although this movement has initially criticized the above-mentioned various erroneous ideas, it is not deep enough, and it will take a long process to thoroughly transform the design personnel ideologically. Therefore, in the future, we must constantly strengthen our concern and help for them politically, consolidate the progressive factors in their thinking, wage unremitting struggle against bourgeois design thinking, guide everyone to sincerely and practically learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and constantly improve design thinking and technical level, so as to better complete the tasks assigned to us by the state.

    鞍山钢铁公司在设计人员中进行思想工作的经验
    中共鞍山市委员会
    编者按：一九五三年的设计任务已基本完成，一九五四年的设计即将开始，各设计单位应抓住这一空隙，通过检查工作，总结经验，批判错误，以提高设计的思想水平和技术水平，保证更好地完成一九五四年的设计任务。为此，我们特将鞍山钢铁公司在设计人员中进行思想工作的经验介绍于后，供大家参考。
    鞍山钢铁公司设计处全处技术人员和职员，在去冬和今春进行了思想建设运动。通过这次运动，使领导上明确了在设计部门进行政治工作的目的是为了完成设计任务；对设计人员进行思想改造是搞好设计工作的重要保证。通过这次运动，技术人员和职员的觉悟提高了，初步树立了正确的设计思想，认识到学习苏联是做好设计工作的关键，重视了搜集原始资料，在设计中开始考虑经济核算、先进定额和整体观念等问题。在运动中，大家讨论了全年设计计划，批判了保守思想，修订后的计划比原计划节省了五万多个工作日；各科都订了听苏联专家讲课的计划，并用图表记录等办法，积极研究和贯彻苏联专家的建议。此外，在运动中并发展了三十三名党员。
    这次运动的主要经验是：
    一、对设计人员进行思想教育，必须结合实际工作。鞍钢设计处开始时对此认识不足，曾要求在运动中划清阶级界限，交代关系，肃清“三大敌人”思想，并生硬地搬用了当时大专学校思想改造的做法，以某些人为“重点”进行批判。结果使运动走了弯路，不仅造成了很大的思想波动，不能推动当前的实际工作，而且运动本身也无法深入开展，领导陷于被动。后来，领导上研究了这种情况，学习了东北局指示和人民日报社论等文件，明确了设计处当前的最主要问题是设计人员存在着资产阶级保守落后的技术观点，工作不负责任，不学习苏联先进经验。如八号高炉称量车、八号高炉系统及大孤山变电所等工程的设计，由于上述原因，产生了很多错误，给国家造成了极严重的损失。于是便及时转变了领导方法，确定采取总结工作、肯定成绩、揭发缺点、批判各种错误思想的方法，一方面布置学习文件，使大家认识思想建设的重要意义，一方面启发大家自觉地检查工作中的缺点、错误和发生的原因，组织漫谈讨论，进行分析批判。
    改变了运动的领导方法以后，大家都感到思想建设与自己的工作有很大关系，消除了顾虑，运动顺利地展开了。
    二、选择典型设计，启发自觉，开展批评和自我批评。
    经过一段摸索过程后，该处即集中力量检查八号高炉的称量车工程，给全处创造经验，做样子。其主要做法是：从设计的过程中，了解设计人员的思想活动；然后抓住造成错误的主导思想进行启发教育。在检查时，先弄清工程设计的梗概内容、当时的客观环境和条件、设计的全部过程、设计错误所造成的损失以及产生错误的原因等。（一般在开始检查时，不要单纯指责错误及其后果，以免引起不必要的顾虑。）经过这样的检查，暴露了设计人员拒绝学习苏联先进经验，不接受工人意见，工作不负责任等一系列的错误事实。如设计总负责人白荫章工程师一开始就不愿意接受这项任务，嫌麻烦，转手交给了孙开藩工程师；孙开藩工程师也很讨厌修理破车，认为修理破车从来不需要设计，就又把任务交给了一个从未做过整套设计的技术员。在选择设计资料时，明明摆着苏联设计的全套称量车图纸不用，却根据八十二张伪满留下的旧图设计。当称量车的错误已为工人发现后，设计人员不但不虚心考虑工人的意见，反而引用所谓“理论根据”、“计算公式”来堵塞工人的嘴，拒绝工人的合理化建议。这样，从设计的全部过程中联系到每个人的思想活动，启发大家认识到了造成错误的主导思想。
    其次，要弄清设计技术上存在的问题。通过典型的事例，以好坏对比的方法，批判各种错误的设计思想。在称量车工程的检查中，抓住了不合理的杠杆设计，与苏联的扇形齿轮作了鲜明的对比：不合理的杠杆设计要用四百二十五匹马力才能抬起二十五吨重的料罐；而两名见习技术员采用了苏联的量车扇形齿轮转动方法，用三十匹马力就够了。通过这种对比引起争论，暴露了更多的思想问题，认真研究了苏联的先进设计经验，分清是非，吸引群众从揭发错误事实中，深刻地批判了错误的设计思想。这种实事求是的启发、批判，在群众中有很大的说服力量并产生了深刻的影响。
    最后，对技术人员进行思想教育，还必须坚决贯彻启发自觉的原则。该处所采取的具体方法是：一、在进行批评和自我批评前，领导干部要带头检讨自己的缺点与应负的责任。因为设计工作的好坏与领导是否正确是分不开的，同时这样做可以解除大家的顾虑。二、事前要对主要设计人员分别进行启发，总结一个问题时，要召集有关人员座谈，不怕零碎，先不要生硬批判，互相提示回忆，弄清事实后再归纳出几个问题，引导讨论，展开批判。意见有分歧时，要展开争论，解决后做出结论，再引导每个人联系自己进行检查。三、组织技术人员到现场参观因设计错误而未能修复和质量低劣的工程，邀请职工代表作报告，使大家认识到设计必须结合实际，面对现场，倾听群众意见。这种做法对大家的教育极其生动而深刻。
    检查称量车工程取得经验后，领导上即及时总结推广，指出结合实际进行思想建设是必要的和正确的，并以八号高炉系统工程设计科为重点，引导大家对设计上的错误事实与设计人员的错误设计思想，进行了广泛的检查和揭发。在运动中，共揭发了设计上较大的错误二百六十一件，各种错误造成的损失估计达四百二十亿元。各种错误思想遭到了有力的批判。
    这些错误思想综合起来有以下六种：
    一、拒绝接受和学习苏联先进经验的保守落后思想。有些人仍留恋英、美、德、日的落后技术，怀疑苏联先进经验；有些人口头上说是要学习苏联先进技术，实际上仍按照旧图纸资料进行设计；或以“任务太急，学习苏联时间赶不上”为藉口，要“做了以后再学”；或是缺乏刻苦钻研的精神，领会不到苏联经验的先进性；有的是轻率地盲目硬搬，不切合具体情况；有的是不动脑筋，任何大小问题不加考虑，一律问专家；个别严重的则是阳奉阴违，当面对苏联专家点头称是，背后却按自己旧的一套干。这些错误思想通过总结工作暴露出来，引导大家进行了深刻的分析和批判。如三回收鼓风机工程基础，由于不接受苏联专家的建议，造成了返工，延误了工期四个月，浪费水泥七吨，人工三百个。
    二、缺乏为工人阶级服务和轻视工人群众劳动创造的思想。有的设计人员抱着图纸出门万事大吉的态度，对设计为施工服务，施工为生产服务的认识非常不足，对工人操作安全劳动保护及福利卫生等条件概不考虑。如设计第二洗涤机室没有厕所、休息室、急救站和通风设备，反而把日伪时监视工人用的小屋保留了下来。另一方面又不虚心接受工人建议，不相信群众劳动经验，认为工人的建议是“瞎子算命”、“事后诸葛亮”，因而许多工人提的正确建议，都被设计人员用“设计公式”“理论根据”等武器拒绝了。大孤山变电所的设计就因不接受工人建议，浪费了人民币二十三亿元。
    三、缺乏调查研究实事求是的科学态度，普遍不重视原始资料。工程师认为搜集原始资料是下级技术员干的事，技术员认为这不是技术性的工作，做这些事是“大材小用”“学不到技术”。因此造成搜集资料工作无人负责；搜集什么内容，要达到什么要求，没有人出主意；工作方法是否对头，资料是否有使用价值，没有人审核；设计时敷衍了事，单凭主观臆测，结果造成了很多错误。在揭发出来的二百六十一件较大的错误中，由于不重视搜集设计资料的就有六十件，由此可见其严重的程度。
    四、缺乏经济核算思想。有的人为表现自己，不顾经济核算；有的是不作长远打算，只图眼前方便；有的人为了省事，宁可多花钱，不考虑是否浪费了国家资金；有的怕工程安全不保险，自己要负责，便随意加大安全系数。如弓长岭贮矿槽的混凝土柱子原有四根可用，而设计人员认为这样还得搜集资料作调查等，不如重新设计新的省事，就不顾浪费了国家的资金。
    五、不负责任的工作态度。如设计总负责人放弃领导，产品无人审核，错误不能及时纠正，以致造成设计质量低劣及其它许多错误。
    六、在少数设计人员中还存有技术私有，互相轻视、互相打击等思想作风。
    这次运动的经验证明：通过检查工作，揭露和批判错误思想，这种实事求是的说服方法，是一种有效的正确的做法。这不仅引导设计人员认识到自己所负责任的重大，决心揭露错误和批判错误的思想，更重要的是使他们真正从思想上接受教训，纠正错误，发挥积极性，更好地进行工作。同时，这次运动虽初步批判了上述各种错误思想，但还不够深刻，要使设计人员得到彻底的思想改造，还需要较长的过程。因此今后必须经常从政治上加强对他们的关心和帮助，巩固他们思想中的进步因素，对资产阶级设计思想进行不懈的斗争，引导大家诚心诚意、切切实实地学习苏联先进经验，贯彻苏联专家的建议，不断提高设计思想和技术水平，以更好地完成国家交给我们的任务。
