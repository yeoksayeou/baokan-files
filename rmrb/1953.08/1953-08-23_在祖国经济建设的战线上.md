    On the Frontlines of National Economic Construction
    Zhang Zhenshan Creates Advanced Welding Method
    The welding team of the Installation Work Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Engineering Company previously had only one welding cable and one lead wire per welding machine, which could only be used by one person at a time for welding. After painstaking research by team leader Zhang Zhenshan, the lead wire was removed and replaced with a welding cable, and two more welding cables were added. Utilizing the alternating current effect of incoming and outgoing currents, one welding machine could now be used by four people simultaneously, welding four objects.
    After the success of this advanced method, work efficiency increased fourfold compared to before, the quality was more uniform than manual welding, apprentices could do the work of skilled workers, and each person could save 10 kilograms of welding rods per day (equivalent to 1 million yuan).

    Shanghai Penicillin Factory Begins Mass Production
    A penicillin factory in Shanghai has been successfully built and has begun production. This is a modern factory built on ruins. The factory site was originally a dilapidated and desolate auto repair shop. Over the past three years, New China's technicians and workers have built new factory buildings here, repaired and改造 the dilapidated and incomplete penicillin manufacturing machines left by the Kuomintang reactionary government, and, through painstaking research, manufactured a large number of new machines, finally building this factory.
    The construction of the Shanghai Penicillin Factory progressed gradually with the trial production of penicillin. Before liberation, China could not manufacture penicillin. Today, we have domestically produced penicillin, which is the result of the creative labor of New China's technicians and workers. Penicillin is an effective and valuable drug for treating pneumonia, meningitis, and other diseases. To enable this drug to be supplied in large quantities to meet the needs of medical departments, the factory's deputy director, Tong Cun, under the care of the People's Government since the liberation of Shanghai, led a group of technicians in the laboratory to conduct experiments for a long time, solving a series of technical problems in penicillin manufacturing from fermentation to crystallization. After that, they began trial production of penicillin using machines. In the trial production process, they overcame many difficulties in equipment and raw materials, finally bringing penicillin manufacturing onto a large-scale mechanized production. According to the inspection of the finished products, the efficacy and purity of the penicillin manufactured by the Shanghai Penicillin Factory fully meet international standards. The personnel of this factory have been rewarded by higher authorities for this significant contribution to China's medical and health undertakings, and a film has been made by the state-owned film studio.

    Construction Worker Gao Xiucheng Creates a Mortar Spreading, Bricklaying, and Grouting Machine
    Construction worker Gao Xiucheng of the Chengdu Railway Factory Construction Engineering Office created a mortar spreading, bricklaying, and grouting machine. Using this machine for bricklaying, one skilled worker and one ordinary worker can lay an average of one brick per second. Assuming an eight-hour workday, excluding three hours of preparation, the actual working time is five hours, and 18,000 bricks can be laid, increasing work efficiency by more than tenfold, and the quality of bricklaying also meets the standards.
    The bricklaying machine is propelled by wheels, with mortar installed in the front and bricks placed in the back. An ordinary worker pours the mortar into the mortar hopper, and then a skilled worker places the bricks on the brick sliding roller, and it is laid with a push. This bricklaying machine is most suitable for large buildings and long brick walls, where the longer the wall, the more the machine's efficiency can be发挥; it is less effective for places with many doors and windows and small and tall buildings. If the labor force is well organized and the supply of mortar and bricks is timely, using this machine will be even more convenient.
    Currently, Gao Xiucheng's mortar spreading, bricklaying, and grouting machine is being promoted in the Chengdu Municipal Construction Workers' Advanced Technology Training Class and many construction sites. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Rehe Province Afforests Over 90,000 Mu During Rainy Season
    The people of Rehe Province are accelerating the transformation of the natural environment, afforesting over 90,000 mu during this year's rainy season. Combined with the spring afforestation, the province's total afforestation area this year has reached over 240,000 mu. Currently, large areas of black pine planted on the shaded slopes of many barren mountains have grown two inches high. Drought-resistant elm trees planted in sandy wastelands, and willows planted along rivers, dams, and irrigation canals have all sprouted new buds.
    During the rainy season afforestation in Rehe Province, the more than twenty afforestation stations established by the People's Government in various places have loaned 30,000 jin of black pine seeds and a large number of black pine seedlings to farmers in mountainous areas; and helped farmers choose tree species such as poplar, willow, and elm that are suitable for planting in the local soil. During the afforestation, the farmers' enthusiasm is very high. Many mutual aid groups, freely formed afforestation groups, and individual farmers have all carefully planted trees by selecting suitable forest land. Farmers in the Wufendi Village afforestation group in Wudan County plowed the land loose with plows before sowing seeds, just like planting crops. Currently, farmers in various parts of Rehe Province are actively preparing tree seeds and seedlings, actively welcoming the upcoming large-scale autumn afforestation. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Yantai Aquatic Product Farming Subdivision Harvests Kelp
    The Yantai subdivision of the state-owned Shandong Aquatic Product Farm is busily harvesting kelp. In recent days, the calm sea off Yantai has been unusually active. In the morning, aquatic product workers put on diving suits and submerged into the seabed to begin the busy harvesting work. Transportation workers, with faces reddened by the scorching sun, filled transport ships with the large quantities of kelp harvested from the seabed and sent them to the shore. Female workers in the drying and processing group are also working from morning to night.
    Kelp is not only a nutritious food, but also has great uses in the rubber industry, wool textile industry, and medicine. During this year's harvest season, the workers of the Yantai subdivision came up with various methods to ensure the quality of the products. When encountering cloudy and rainy weather, they put the harvested kelp in net bags and nourished them on specially set up shelves in the deep sea, and then sent them to the shore for processing after the weather cleared. The female workers in the processing group also improved their operating methods, first removing the roots of the harvested kelp, and then drying them in the sun. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Farmers in Lizhai Township, Junan County, Shandong Province Improve Cultivated Land, Autumn Grain Production is Expected to Increase
    Most of the cultivated land in Lizhai Township, Junan County, Shandong Province, is thin land on hills and ridges. The crops do not grow vigorously enough, and the yields were originally low. In addition, once the rainy season arrives, many hillside crops are either flooded to death or washed away, resulting in a significant reduction in production. To achieve the task of increasing production, the farmers in the township improved a large amount of cultivated land last winter and this spring, and also paid attention to protecting seedlings and improving cultivation methods during cultivation. The peanuts planted on the hills will increase by one times compared to last year. Due to the deep plowing making the soil loose and thick, able to contain moisture, the crops are no longer flooded or washed away. Farmer Li Yuelian has 1.6 mu of waterlogged land. In the past, no matter what he planted, he could harvest at most 50 jin. This year, he improved this piece of land into half dry land and half paddy field. He planted rice in the paddy field and millet and corn in the dry land, and can harvest more than 500 jin in total. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Qionglai Mountain Tea Farmers Joyfully Pick Tea
    In June, the tea trees in the mountainous areas of Qionglai County, Sichuan Province, are full of vigorous second-flush buds. Tea farmers are filled with laughter, busily picking tea in the depths of the green bushes.
    Qionglai County is a famous green tea producing area in Sichuan Province. The county has 20,000 mu of tea land, producing more than 800,000 jin of dried tea leaves annually. The famous Huaqiuyan "Tribute Tea" comes from the mountains of the seventh district here. From the Qingming Festival when hundreds of flowers bloom, picking continues until the geese fly north. Tea has supported the farmers on the mountains for generations.
    Over the past three years, with the support of the People's Government, the tea farmers have diligently and happily reclaimed many tea forests that were abandoned and cut down during the Kuomintang rule. The area of tea land has been expanding year by year. Last year, the People's Government loaned more than 146 million yuan to more than 2,500 tea farmers to solve the fertilizer problem. The tea farmers changed the rough tea planting methods of the past. Fertilizers were generally applied to tea trees, and the price of tea leaves continued to rise with the expansion of sales. Last year, the price of medium-quality dried tea was 3,200 yuan per jin, with the highest being more than 7,000 yuan, which could be exchanged for more than two sheng of rice on average, six or seven times higher than the price during the reactionary rule. This year, the price of medium-quality dried tea has risen to 5,800 yuan per jin, with the highest selling for more than 10,000 yuan. (Zhang Tianjian)

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    张振山创造先进的电焊法
    太原钢铁厂工程公司安装工作部电焊小组，过去一个电焊机只有一根接焊线和一根引线，电焊时只能供一人使用。经过小组长张振山苦心钻研，把引线去掉，改为接焊线，再增加两根接焊线，利用来去电流的交流作用，一个电焊机便可以供四个人同时操作，能电焊四个物件。
    这一先进工作法成功后，工作效率较前提高四倍，质量较人工电焊均匀，徒工可以做技工的活，每人每天还可节省十公斤焊条（合人民币一百万元）。                        （吴顺智）
    上海青霉素制造厂开始大量生产
    上海市一座青霉素制造厂已建设成功，并开始生产。这是一座在废墟上建设起来的近代化工厂。这个工厂的厂址原是一个破烂荒凉的汽车修配厂。三年来，新中国的技术人员和工人在这里盖起了新的厂房，把国民党反动政府遗留下来的一些破烂不堪残缺不全的制造青霉素的机器加以修理改造，并且经过苦心钻研，制造出大批新的机器，终于把这个工厂建设起来。
    上海青霉素制造厂的建设是随着青霉素的试制逐步进行的。解放前的中国不会制造青霉素。今天有了国产的青霉素，是新中国技术人员和工人创造性劳动的结果。青霉素是治疗肺炎、脑膜炎等多种疾病有效而贵重的药品。为使这种药品能够大量供应医疗部门的需要，这个工厂的副厂长童村从上海解放时起，就在人民政府的关怀下领导着一部分技术人员在实验室里作了很长时间的试验，解决了青霉素制造中从发酵到结晶一系列的技术问题。之后他们开始用机器试制青霉素。在试制过程中，又克服了设备上和原料上的许多困难，终于使青霉素的制造走上大规模的机械化生产。上海青霉素制造厂制造的青霉素的效力和纯净程度，根据成品的检验，完全合乎国际标准。这个工厂的人员对我国医药卫生事业这一重大贡献，已得到了上级机关的奖励，并由国营电影制片厂拍成了电影。    （新华社）
    建筑工人高秀成创造了铺灰砌砖灌浆机
    成都铁路工厂建厂工程处建筑工人高秀成创造铺灰砌砖灌浆机。用这个铺灰砌砖灌浆机砌砖，一个技术工人和一个普通工人，平均每秒钟可砌一块砖，以每天工作八小时计算，除掉三小时的准备工作，实际作业五小时，可砌一万八千块砖，比原来的工作效率提高了十多倍，砌砖的质量也合乎标准。
    砌砖机是用轮子推行，前面装灰浆，后面放砖，一个普通工人把灰浆灌入灰斗内，然后由一个技术工人把砖放入滑砖梯辊上，一推就砌好了。这种砌砖机最适用于大型建筑和长的砖墙，墙越长机器效能就越能发挥；使用于门窗多的地方和小而高的建筑，效果就要差些。如果劳动力组织得好，灰浆和砖供应得及时，使用这个机器就更方便。
    现在，高秀成的铺灰砌砖灌浆机正在成都市建筑工人先进技术训练班和许多工地中推广。    （新华社）
    热河省雨季造林九万多亩
    热河省人民正在加速改变自然环境，今年雨季里造林九万多亩。加上春季造林，全省今年的造林面积已达二十四万多亩。现在，许多秃山的阴坡栽种的大片的黑松，已长二寸高。沙荒里种的耐旱的榆树，河流、坝堰和灌溉渠旁栽的杨柳，都已发出嫩芽。
    热河省雨季造林中，人民政府在各地设立的二十多个造林站，把三万斤黑松种籽和大批黑松幼苗贷给了山区农民；并帮助农民选择了适宜当地土壤栽种的杨、柳和榆树等树种。造林中，农民们的情绪十分高涨。许多互助组、自由结成的造林小组和个体农民，都选择适宜的林地细致地栽种树木。乌丹县五分地村造林小组的农民，像种地一样地先用犁把地耕松，再撒树种。现在，热河省各地的农民还在积极准备树种、树苗，积极迎接即将到来的大规模的秋季造林。

    烟台水产养殖分场收割海带
    国营山东水产养殖场烟台分场正紧张地收割海带菜。连日来，平静的烟台海面上显得异常活跃。早晨，水产工人们便穿上潜水衣沉入海底，开始了繁忙的收割工作。被烈日晒红了脸的运输工人们把从海底收割上来的大批海带菜装满了运输船，送到岸边。晒干加工组的女工们，也从早到晚地忙碌着。
    海带菜不但是一种富有营养的食品，而且在橡胶工业、毛纺工业和医疗上也都有很大的用处。烟台分场的工人们在今年的收割期中，想出了种种办法来保证产品的质量。遇到阴雨的天气，他们便把割好的海带菜装在网包里，放在深海特设的架子上滋养着，天晴后再送到岸上加工。加工组的女工们也改进了操作方法，把收割来的海带菜先去掉菜根，然后曝晒。                （据新华社讯）
    山东莒南县厉寨乡农民改良耕地秋粮增产有望
    山东省莒南县厉寨乡的耕地绝大部分是山岭薄地，庄稼生长不够壮旺，产量原来就低，加以一到雨季，许多山坡地的庄稼不被涝死就被冲走，更要大大减产。该乡农民为了实现增产的任务，在去冬今春改良了大量耕地，耕作中又随时注意保苗和改进耕作方法。种在山岭上的花生，将比去年增产一倍。由于深翻后土层松厚，能够含蓄水分，庄稼没再受涝或被冲。农民厉月廉有一亩六分涝地，过去不论种什么，顶多收五十斤。今年他把这块地改良成一半旱田一半水田，水田种了稻，旱田种了谷子和玉米等，共可收五百多斤。    （新华社）
    邛崃山茶农欢欣采茶
    六月，四川省邛崃县山地的茶树发满了茁壮的第二道嫩芽，茶农们洋溢着欢笑，在绿丛深处忙着采茶。
    邛崃县是四川省著名的绿茶产区，全县有两万亩茶地，年产干茶叶八十余万斤。著名的花秋堰“贡茶”，就是出在这里第七区的山上。从百花开放的清明时节，采摘到雁鹅北去，茶叶世世代代养活着山上的农民。
    三年来，在人民政府的扶助下，茶农勤劳愉快地垦复了许多在国民党统治时期荒芜了和砍光了的茶林，茶地的面积一年年扩大。去年人民政府又贷了一亿四千六百多万元的款子，给二千五百多户茶农解决了肥料问题。茶农改变了过去粗糙的种茶方法。茶树普遍施了肥料，茶叶的价格也随着销路的扩大而不断提高。去年每斤中等干茶的价格是三千二百元，最高的七千多元，平均可换上两升多大米，比反动派统治时期的价格提高了六、七倍。今年，中等干茶的价格又提高到每斤五千八百元，最高的可卖万余元。                （张天健）
