The Bo Mountain Reservoir Under Construction
Xiang Tao, Ma Wei

A year ago, the Bo Mountain area in Queshan County, Henan Province, was still a desolate mountainous region. Now, tens of thousands of laborers are creating a great construction project here: the Bo Mountain Reservoir, which combines flood control and water conservancy.

As you walk on the highway a thousand meters away from the construction site, you can hear the deafening roar. This is the air compressor drilling the aqueduct, the water pump drawing water from the diversion channel, the majestic bulldozer dragging the sheepsfoot roller, compacting the newly laid dam foundation, and the nimble side-dump cars, loaded with stones, speeding along the dense network of narrow-gauge railways, transporting materials back and forth... Tens of thousands of migrant workers are densely packed on the construction site, each carrying a full basket of mud, working in an orderly manner. Every night, tens of thousands of electric lights emit a dazzling brilliance, and the entire construction site becomes a sea of ​​silver light. Cheerful songs are constantly broadcast from the loudspeakers, and the night shift workers begin their intense labor.

The Bo Mountain Reservoir has three main projects: building an earth dam 38 meters high and 445 meters long between Li Gang Mountain and Bo Mountain as the wall of the reservoir. A tunnel 314 meters long and 3.5 meters in diameter is being dug on Li Gang Mountain to the left of the earth dam to serve as the flood control gate of the reservoir (aqueduct). During the rainy season, the gate will be closed, and the flood will be safely stored in the reservoir. In the dry season, the gate will be opened, and the water will flow out to irrigate the fields. To the right rear of the earth dam, between Ma'anshan and Bo Mountain, 4 kilometers from the dam foundation, an overflow channel 700 meters long, 50 meters wide at the bottom, and 4 meters lower than the top of the dam is being dug. It lies like a big river in the Ma'anshan depression, serving as the "safety gate" of the reservoir. If the mountain flood suddenly increases, it can meander from the "safety gate" into the Qintou River, ensuring the safety of the earth dam.

Our motherland is in the early stages of large-scale economic construction. Today, when technical and material conditions are still relatively lacking, it is indeed difficult to build such a magnificent project. However, in the face of the creative working class, the heroic People's Liberation Army, and tens of thousands of hardworking migrant workers who have turned themselves around, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. Coupled with the sincere help of the great Soviet friends and the support of all parts of the motherland, all difficulties have been conquered. Before the construction of the project, Soviet water conservancy expert Bukov personally came to Bo Mountain to help us with surveying and design. After construction began, just as the aqueduct excavation project encountered the "stubborn enemy" – quartzite (the hardest rock), and the project was progressing very slowly, the Soviet drill bits with strong combat power were delivered to the construction site. Each British and American drill bit had to be replaced more than 30 times for each hole drilled, and it took more than an hour. However, each Soviet drill bit could drill two or three holes, and each hole only took fifteen minutes. Once the Soviet drill bits arrived, the difficulty was solved. From Huangshanpo Station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway to the reservoir construction site, there is a wide and flat highway. On this highway, there is a constant stream of cars, horse carts, and ox carts, transporting various equipment from all over the motherland to the construction site. Steel bars and wood are needed to support the tunnel project. The original pillars from the Daxing'anling forest area in Northeast China and the steel bars from Anshan Iron and Steel arrived. Cement is needed to pour the water-retaining wall of the diversion channel. Cement from Qixin in Tangshan arrived. The migrant workers need food, and rice from the south was brought by train. This strong support greatly boosted the workers' labor enthusiasm and accelerated the progress of the project.

At present, the main projects of the Bo Mountain Reservoir, the excavation of the overflow channel and the filling of the earth dam foundation, have been completed. The aqueduct was also successfully opened on June 1st. All projects will be completed before the flood season next year. At that time, it will be able to store more than 280 million cubic meters of floodwater, preventing the floods from the Funiu Mountains from overflowing into disasters, and irrigating 400,000 mu of land downstream of the Qintou River. At the same time, the tailwater flowing out of the reservoir can also be used to generate electricity.

    兴建中的薄山水库
    向韬  马威
    一年以前，河南省确山县薄山地区还是一个荒凉的山区；现在，数万劳动大军却在这里创造着一个伟大的建设工程——防洪结合兴利的薄山蓄水库。
    当你还在工地千公尺以外的公路上走着的时候，便可以听到??的巨响。这是空气压缩机在开凿输水道、抽水机在截水槽抽水，雄伟的推土机拖着羊角碾，轧着刚刚垫起的坝基，灵巧轻便的斗平车满载着石头，飞奔在密如蛛网的轻便铁路上，来往运输……密布工地的数万民工，每人担着满筐的泥土，井井有序地劳动着。每当夜晚，数万盏电灯放出耀眼的光辉，整个工地变成了银光灿烂的海洋。扩音器里不停地播送着愉快的歌曲，夜班工人开始了紧张的劳动。
    薄山水库有三个主要工程：在李岗山与薄山之间修筑一个高三十八公尺、全长四百四十五公尺的土坝，作为水库的墙壁。在土坝左边李岗山上凿通一个长三百一十四公尺、直径三点五公尺的隧洞，作为水库控制洪水的大门（输水道），雨季将闸门关起来，洪水就安全地储蓄在水库里，旱季将闸门打开，水就流出去灌溉田地。在土坝的右后方，距坝基四公里的马鞍山与薄山之间开凿一条长七百公尺、底宽五十公尺、比坝顶低四公尺的溢洪道。它像一条大河躺在马鞍山坳里，作为水库的“太平门”，倘若山洪突然增涨，可从“太平门”里蜿蜒流入溱头河，确保土坝的安全。
    祖国正处在大规模经济建设的初期，在技术、物资等条件还比较缺乏的今天，要修筑这样宏伟的工程，确实是有困难的。但是，在富有创造性的工人阶级面前、英雄的解放军面前、数万翻了身的勤劳的民工面前，没有解决不了的困难。再加上伟大的苏联友人真挚的帮助和祖国各地的支持，所有的困难，都被征服了。工程施工以前，苏联水利专家布可夫，曾亲自来薄山帮助我们勘察设计。施工后，正当输水道开凿工程碰上了“顽敌”——石英岩
    （最坚硬的石质），工程进行非常缓慢的时候，具有顽强战斗力的苏联钻花运到了工地。英、美钻花，每打一个石眼要换三十多个，并且需用一个多钟头；苏联钻花每个却能打两三个石眼，每个石眼只需用十五分钟。苏联钻花一到，困难就解决了。从京汉铁路的黄山坡车站，通往水库工地的是一条宽阔而平坦的公路，在这条公路上，每天都有络绎不绝的汽车、马车、牛车，源源地向工地运送着来自祖国各地的各种器材。隧洞工程需用钢筋、木料支撑，东北大兴安岭森林区的原柱和鞍钢的钢筋运到了，截水槽需用水泥浇筑涝水墙，唐山启新的水泥运到了，民工们需用粮食，南方的大米用火车装来了。这些有力的支援，大大地鼓舞了工人们的劳动情绪，加速了工程的进展。
    现在，薄山水库的主要工程溢洪道的开挖和土坝基的填土工程已全部竣工。输水道也在六月一日胜利打通了。明年汛期以前全部工程都将完成。那时，它便能拦蓄洪水二亿八千多立方公尺。使从伏牛山淌下来的洪流不再泛滥成灾，而使溱头河下游四十万亩土地，得到灌溉。同时，水库淌出来的尾水又可用来发电。
