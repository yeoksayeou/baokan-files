    Sichuan Provincial Department of Education and Wanxian Special District Office Issue Conflicting Instructions on Filling Out Report Forms
    A letter from Luo Guangmei and Li Xianrong of the Culture and Education Section of the Wushan County People's Government, Sichuan Province: In order to overcome the phenomenon of excessive forms, the Sichuan Provincial People's Government Education Department issued a notice on June 19 this year stating that the "End-of-Term Report Forms for Schools of All Levels and Types" that were filled out at the end of each semester in the past can now be discontinued. However, on June 26 and July 11, the Wanxian Special District Office issued two notices requiring us to fill out the forms on time. To clarify whether this report form should be filled out, we separately requested instructions from the Wanxian Special District Office and the Provincial Department of Education. On July 16, comrades from the Culture and Education Section of the Wanxian Special District Office replied to us over the phone, saying: "Follow the notice of the Provincial Department of Education; this report form does not need to be filled out in the future." The Provincial Department of Education replied to us on July 15: "In order to reduce the burden on schools, the end-of-term report form will be discontinued." After receiving such clear instructions, we notified all schools to stop filling out the forms. Unexpectedly, the Wanxian Special District Office issued a written reply to us on August 3, saying: "The end-of-term report forms for schools of all levels and types can continue to be used, and the Special District Office Culture and Education Section has been notified to comply." This instruction from the Wanxian Special District Office not only contradicts the instructions of the Provincial Department of Education but is also inconsistent with the reply from the Special District Office Culture and Education Section. This makes it really difficult for us to handle. Because all schools in the county have already closed for vacation and teachers have returned home, it is impossible to refill the forms.
    The above situation is mainly caused by the disconnect in the work among the Provincial Department of Education, the Special District Office, and the Culture and Education Section of the Special District Office. We hope that the leading organs of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education and the Wanxian Special District Office will investigate the causes of this situation and effectively improve future work.

### 四川省教育厅和万县专署等对填写表报问题批示有矛盾

专栏：读者来信摘要

    四川省教育厅和万县专署等对填写表报问题批示有矛盾
    四川省巫山县人民政府文教科罗光楣、李显荣来信：为了克服滥发表格的现象，四川省人民政府教育厅在今年六月十九日通知：过去每学期末填报的“各级各类学校期末报表”今后可停止填报。但是，六月二十六日和七月十一日，万县专署又先后两次通知我们必须按时填报。我们为了弄清这个报表究竟应否填报，又分别向万县专署及省教育厅请示。七月十六日，万县专署文教科的同志在电话中答复我们说：“按省教育厅通知办理，这个报表今后可不必填报。”七月十五日省教育厅给我们的批复是：“为了减少学校负担，期末报表停止填报。”我们在接到这样明确的指示后，就通知各校停止填报。不料八月三日万县专署给我们的书面批复中竟又说：“各级各类学校期末报表仍可继续使用，已通知专署文教科遵照办理。”万县专署这个批示，不仅与省教育厅的指示相矛盾，而且和专署文教科的答复不一致。这使我们实在难以处理。因为全县各校都已放假，教师也回了家，要重新填报是不可能的。
    以上情况之所以产生，主要是由于省教育厅、专署和专署文教科之间工作中的脱节所造成。我们希望四川省教育厅和万县专署等领导机关检查发生这种情况的原因，切实改进今后工作。
