    Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 19th: TASS, New York, August 19th: At the beginning of the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee meeting on the morning of the 18th, the first speaker was the United States representative, Lodge. After pointing out that "our task here is to make the armistice practically effective," Lodge said that the United States had always adhered to Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement and the meaning of "both sides" in it regarding the political conference. Lodge said that the proposal put forward by the United States and fourteen other countries "presents recommendations regarding our side." In explaining the terms of this proposal, Lodge said: "At the political conference, we will discuss some specific issues stipulated in Article 60 in order to promote the cause of peace in Korea." Lodge went on to say that if this meeting achieves this goal, the door will be opened for further discussions on other issues. In these further discussions, if appropriate, another meeting will be held to study a series of specific issues in the Far East. Lodge said that, naturally, those countries that have a special relationship with the issues to be discussed at this other meeting can participate in this meeting. Our current decision regarding the countries participating in the Korean political conference does not determine who will participate in future meetings.
    The French representative, Maurice Schumann, then spoke. He said: The armistice should be the first step towards restoring the unity of Korea, which in turn would enable Korea to "restore normal relations with its neighbors, thereby helping to restore peace and security in the Far East." He said that in order to achieve this goal, "all parties that can effectively participate in the negotiations should be invited. In short, the meeting should not become a meeting of two opposing hostile camps; on the contrary, this meeting should pave the way for a common discussion of current issues." Maurice Schumann suggested that the political conference be held in Geneva, and he said that the agenda of the conference should be decided by the political conference itself. Maurice Schumann concluded: "Negotiations on the Korean issue are about to begin. May these negotiations create an atmosphere that can promote peace in Southeast Asia."
    The British representative, Lloyd, advocated conducting the political conference in the form of a round table conference. He said that Britain does not want to maintain the concept of permanent opposition between the two sides, so as to avoid creating something like a "political Panmunjom meeting." Lloyd expressed his agreement with the joint proposal of Australia and New Zealand, which suggested inviting the Soviet Union to participate in the political conference. Lloyd said that Britain also suggested inviting India to participate in the political conference, because India is a major Asian country and because India has shown initiative and made every effort to assist in achieving the armistice in Korea. Regarding the agenda of the political conference, Lloyd believed that it is best for the representatives of various countries not to adopt a fixed attitude on this issue for the time being, so that once a solution is reached on the Korean issue, the political conference can immediately turn to discussing other issues, including the Indochina issue mentioned by Schumann. Lloyd concluded by saying that Britain believes that the United Nations should be kept informed of the progress of the political conference, a principle that Britain attaches great importance to. He said: "If difficulties arise in the course of the work, the United Nations must find ways to eliminate them."
    The Australian representative, Spender, also said that the meeting should be conducted in a consultative atmosphere in the form of a round table conference. Spender believed that the Soviet Union should be invited to participate in the meeting, because without the participation of the Soviet Union, the meeting would not be successful.
    The New Zealand representative also expressed the same opinion.
    Then, the United States representative, Lodge, spoke again. He said that the United States was fully prepared to "let the Soviet Union participate in the meeting." However, Lodge said, the Soviet Union cannot participate in the meeting "on the side of the countries participating in the United Nations action." He went on to say that the Soviet Union cannot participate in the work of the meeting as a neutral country. The morning meeting adjourned at this point.
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 19th: TASS, New York, August 19th: On the afternoon of August 18th, the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its meeting to discuss the issue of membership in the Korean problem political conference. The representatives of the Netherlands and Belgium spoke, supporting the fifteen-nation proposal and calling on the United Nations General Assembly to "exert all possible efforts" to create "the most favorable conditions" for the convening of the meeting. The Dutch representative, Barusek, said that if the political conference can successfully resolve the Korean issue, it will open the way for further broad discussions on other Far Eastern issues. Barusek also said that the Netherlands supports those proposals that suggest that the Soviet Union and India participate in the political conference. The Belgian representative, Niso, said that the General Assembly should do everything possible to avoid the mutual accusations that have occurred in the past, so that the possibility of seeking a peaceful resolution through the political conference is not threatened.
    After the representatives of the Netherlands and Belgium spoke, because no one else indicated that they wanted to speak, the chairman of the Political Committee announced the adjournment of the meeting.

    联大政治委员会十八日会议
    讨论政治会议成员问情形
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十九日讯：在联合国大会政治委员会十八日上午会议讨论开始时，首先发言的是美国代表洛奇。洛奇在指出“我们在此间的任务是使停战发生实际效用”以后说：美国一直信守停战协定第六十款以及其中关于政治会议的“双方一词的意义”。洛奇说，美国和其他十四个国家一同提出的提案，“提出了关于我们一方的建议。”在说明这个提案的条款时，洛奇说：“在政治会议上，我们将讨论第六十款规定的一些具体问题，以便促进朝鲜的和平事业。”洛奇接着说，假如这次会议达到了这个目标，进一步讨论其他问题的大门便将打开了。在这些进一步的讨论中，如果适当的话，将讨论召开另一次会议来研究一系列的远东具体问题。洛奇说，自然，那些与这另一次会议所将讨论的问题有特殊关系的国家都可以参加这个会议。我们现在对于参加朝鲜政治会议的国家这件事所作的决定，并不确定谁将参加以后举行的会议。
    法国代表莫里斯·舒曼接着发言。他说：停战应该是使朝鲜恢复统一的第一步，而这又会使得朝鲜可能“与它的邻国恢复正常关系，因而会帮助在远东恢复和平和安全”。他说，为了达到这个目标，“一切能有效地参加谈判的方面都理应加以邀请。简而言之，会议不要成为两个相对而坐的敌对阵营的会议，相反地这个会议要为共同讨论当前问题铺平道路”。莫里斯·舒曼建议政治会议在日内瓦举行，他说会议的议程应由政治会议自己决定。莫里斯·舒曼最后说：“朝鲜问题的谈判马上就要开始了，愿这次谈判造成能促进东南亚和平的气氛。”
    英国代表劳埃德主张以圆桌会议的形式进行政治会议。他说，英国不希望永远保持双方对立的概念，以免造成“政治上的板门店会议”之类的东西。劳埃德表示同意澳大利亚和新西兰的联合提案，这个提案建议邀请苏联参加政治会议。劳埃德说，英国并建议邀请印度参加政治会议，因为印度是一个亚洲大国，而且因为印度表现了主动，竭力协助在朝鲜实现停战。关于政治会议的议程问题，劳埃德认为最好各国代表在这个问题上目前先不要采取一成不变的态度，以便在朝鲜问题上一旦获得解决时，政治会议可以马上转而讨论其他问题，包括舒曼所提到的印度支那问题。劳埃德最后说，英国认为联合国应该经常获知政治会议进行的情况，这个原则是英国非常重视的。他说：“假如在工作进行中发生了困难，联合国一定得设法加以消除。”
    澳大利亚代表斯宾德也说，会议应该以圆桌会议的形式在协商的气氛中进行。斯宾德认为，会议应该邀请苏联参加，因为如果没有苏联参加，会议是不可能成功的。
    新西兰代表也表示了同样的意见。
    接着，美国代表洛奇再度发言。他说，美国完全准备“让苏联参加会议”。但是，洛奇说，苏联不能“站在参加联合国行动的国家一方面”参加会议。他接着又说，苏联也不能以中立国的身份参加会议的工作。上午会议至此休会。
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十九日讯：八月十八日下午，联合国大会政治委员会继续开会，讨论朝鲜问题政治会议的成员问题。荷兰和比利时代表发言，支持十五国提案，并呼吁联合国大会“尽一切可能的力量”，创造“最有利的条件”，以利于会议的召开。荷兰代表巴鲁塞克说，假如政治会议能成功地解决朝鲜问题，它就为进一步广泛地讨论其他远东问题开拓了道路。巴鲁塞克又说，荷兰支持那些建议苏联和印度参加政治会议的提案。比利时代表尼索说，大会应尽一切力量，避免以前发生过的互相谴责，以使得通过政治会议谋求和平解决的可能性不致受到威胁。
    在荷兰和比利时代表发言之后，因为再没有别的人表示要发言，政治委员会主席便宣告休会。
