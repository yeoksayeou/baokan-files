Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st: TASS reported that on July 30th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs handed a note to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The full text of the note is as follows:

"The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics deems it necessary to issue the following statement to the Government of the United States of America:

According to verified materials, on July 29th, at approximately 7:00 AM Vladivostok time, a four-engine B-50 bomber bearing U.S. national insignia first intruded into the Soviet border in the Gamov Strait area, and then continued to fly over Soviet territory near Askold Island, not far from Vladivostok. When two Soviet fighter planes approached the U.S. aircraft to indicate that it had flown into Soviet territory and to suggest that it leave Soviet airspace, the U.S. aircraft opened fire on them, severely damaging one of the two Soviet aircraft, which was hit in its fuselage and left wing, and the airtightness of the pilot's cockpit was also breached. Consequently, the two Soviet aircraft had to return fire, and as a result, the U.S. aircraft fled in the direction of the sea.

The Soviet Government lodges a firm protest with the U.S. Government against the serious act of this U.S. military aircraft intruding into the Soviet border, and firmly demands that those responsible for this intrusion into the Soviet border be severely punished, and hopes that the U.S. Government will immediately take all measures to prevent U.S. aircraft from intruding into the Soviet border in the future."

    苏联政府照会美国抗议美机侵犯苏联国境
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：七月三十日，苏联外交部交给美国驻莫斯科大使馆一个照会，照会全文如下：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府认为有必要向美利坚合众国政府发表下列的声明：
    根据已经核实了的材料，今年七月二十九日海参崴时间七点钟左右的时候，一架涂有美国国徽的四引擎B—50型轰炸机首先在加莫夫海峡地区侵入苏联国境，然后在苏联国境内离海参崴不远的阿斯科尔德岛附近的上空继续飞行。当两架苏联战斗机为了向这架美国飞机指出它已飞到苏联境内并建议它离开苏联领空而向这架美国飞机飞近时，这架美国飞机竟向它们开火并严重地击坏了上述两架苏联飞机中的一架，它的机身和左翼被击中，驾驶员座舱的密闭性也被破坏了。因此，这两架苏联飞机不得不开火回击，结果，这架美国飞机向大海方向逃跑了。
    苏联政府向美国政府提出坚决的抗议，抗议这架美国军用飞机侵犯苏联国境的严重行为，坚决要求严惩这次侵犯苏联国境的人员，并希望美国政府立即采取各种措施，防止美国飞机将来再侵犯苏联国境。”
