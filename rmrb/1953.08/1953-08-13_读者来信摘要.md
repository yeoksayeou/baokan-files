Reader's Letters Summary

The Central Food Ministry Should Clearly Stipulate Grain Pricing Methods When Allocating Grain

Letters from Liu Xun, Lü Zhaobing, and Chen Yongjie of the Henan Provincial Food Bureau: The Sales Section of the Operations and Management Department of the Central Food Ministry is very chaotic in handling grain allocation pricing issues, which has increased the difficulty of the work of lower-level food companies. For example, in July, a batch of grain was transferred to Henan from Shanxi, Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia, and the Northeast. We called the section to inquire how this grain should be priced. The section replied: "This batch of grain is within the plan and conforms to the flow direction, so it can be priced according to the receiving party's price." Based on this instruction, we signed allocation contracts with various grain-issuing locations, but the Shanxi Provincial Food Bureau wanted to price it according to the issuing party's price. Our bureau consulted the section again, and the section instructed: "In order to complete the allocation task, price it according to their price!" We asked: "What if Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia, and the Northeast also want to price it according to the issuing party's price?" The section's reply was: "First, propose pricing according to the receiving party's price and sign contracts with them. If it works, great. If not, then change to pricing according to the issuing party's price."

Because the Sales Section of the Operations and Management Department of the Central Food Ministry often has such inconsistent pricing for internal grain allocation, our work has encountered many difficulties. When answering questions from lower-level food agencies, we have to follow the constantly changing instructions, and we have no definite basis when negotiating with other provinces. As a result, determining the pricing method for grain allocation always requires a lot of twists and turns.

We hope that the Central Food Ministry will inspect and improve this work. In the future, when assigning allocation tasks to grain agencies in various regions, the pricing method should be clearly communicated in writing.

Certain Grain Departments in Hunan and Jiangxi

Poor Grain Transfer Planning Leads to a Backlog of Transportation Tools

Letter from Chen Zhiqing of the Central and Southern China Grain Transfer Committee: The grain departments in some areas of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces have poor planning in grain transfer work, uneven distribution of grain sources, or have not fully mobilized the masses to promptly concentrate grain from warehouses in areas with inconvenient transportation to areas along transportation lines, resulting in a backlog of transportation tools and wasting national transportation resources. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the Liuyang County Grain Bureau in Hunan Province had 5,381 tons of civilian boats idled due to having boats but no grain, some for as long as forty days, causing difficulties in the lives of more than 2,000 boatmen and their families. The bureau was fined 182.2 million yuan in demurrage fees. In mid-May, the bureau had another forty-eight civilian boats idled. The Ji'an Special District Grain Bureau in Jiangxi Province, due to poor planning, had a situation of using boats as warehouses at the end of March and the beginning of April this year, idling ninety-six civilian boats (totaling 1,257 tons) for fourteen to twenty days. In addition, Chenxi, Anjiang, and Hongjiang in Hunan Province had more than 8,000 tons of boats idled in May, and Guiyang County also had thirty-nine trucks idled due to untimely grain collection and transportation.

In order to improve the turnover rate of transportation tools, accelerate the completion of grain transfer tasks, and ensure the lives of boatmen and their families, it is recommended that grain and transportation departments at all levels strengthen planning in their work and correct the above-mentioned phenomenon of stockpiling transportation tools.

Lujiang County Grain Bureau Blindly Creates Plans, Wasting Transportation Costs by Transferring Grain Back and Forth

Letter from Lu Xinguo of the Wuhu Special District Grain Bureau in Anhui Province: The Lujiang County Grain Bureau in Anhui Province blindly transferred a large amount of grain out last winter and spring. However, starting in the second quarter of this year, the local area lacked grain and transferred grain from Chaoxian and Wuwei counties. The amount of grain that the county needed to transfer in from other places in the second quarter accounted for one-third of the amount initially transferred out. This back-and-forth transfer wasted transportation costs estimated at over 500 million yuan.

The main reason for the back-and-forth transfer of grain is that the planning section of the Lujiang County Grain Bureau is irresponsible in its work and creates supply and sales plans behind closed doors without understanding the actual situation. The leaders of the county grain bureau and the planning section of the Wuhu Special District Grain Bureau did not strictly review the section's plan and approved it rashly. It is hoped that they can inspect this matter, learn a lesson from it, and improve future supply and sales planning work.

Nanjing Municipal State-Owned Xinning Brick and Tile Factory Violates Basic Construction Procedures, Causing Waste

Letter from reader Miao Jie: The Xinning Brick and Tile Factory, under the Nanjing Municipal Local Industry Bureau, blindly expanded before the basic construction plan was approved, causing losses to national wealth.

Nanjing has more basic construction projects this year than last year, and the demand for bricks and tiles has also increased. However, there are many existing brick and tile kilns in Nanjing, and those that have been put into production have not fully utilized their potential production capacity, and there are still more than one hundred that have not been put into production. Therefore, there is currently no need to add new equipment. The Xinning Brick and Tile Factory did not understand these circumstances and blindly developed more than 200 workers and built ten down-draft kilns before the basic construction plan was approved by the higher authorities. By mid-March, the project was more than 40% complete. At this time, the Local Industry Bureau pointed out that the factory had violated basic construction procedures and ordered it to stop work. The Xinning Brick and Tile Factory did not take timely remedial measures for their mistakes, nor did they properly handle the completed projects. In the past three months, the loss due to the collapse of the kiln pit earthworks due to wind and rain alone has reached approximately 19 million yuan.

I suggest that the Nanjing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee and the Local Industry Bureau conduct a thorough inspection of this matter and make appropriate arrangements in order to learn a lesson from it and prevent similar losses to state property.

Reader's Letters Handling Status for Two Weeks

From July 20th to August 2nd, the reader's letters group of this newspaper received a total of 2,650 reader's letters and the various agencies replied to 660 reader's letters. Among them, 1,165 were related to political and legal issues, 1,160 were related to industrial and agricultural production and financial issues, 927 were related to cultural and educational issues, and 58 were of other natures. One hundred and twenty-three were published in the newspaper, 779 were answered individually to the readers, 1,239 were transferred to relevant agencies for investigation, research, handling, or reply, and 1,076 were kept by this newspaper for reference or did not need to be answered again; the rest are being processed. During the same period, the reader's letters group of this newspaper issued a total of 3,429 replies to readers, requests to relevant agencies for research and handling, and follow-up letters.

After the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the vast number of readers wrote to express their warm support and their determination to strive for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue with practical actions; they also pointed out that we must continue to be vigilant, supervise the other party to earnestly abide by the agreement, and prevent all sabotage. We have selected some of these letters and published them in the newspaper.

In the past two weeks, we have received many letters from readers reflecting that the work of preferential treatment in various regions has achieved great results due to the importance attached to it by the people's government and the efforts of the vast masses; however, the leading organs in some regions do not pay enough attention to the work of preferential treatment, resulting in difficulties in the lives and production of a small number of family members of revolutionary martyrs and disabled revolutionary soldiers. In addition to publishing some of the above letters in summary, we are studying and processing the rest; we hope that readers will continue to write to reflect the situation and problems in this regard.

We continue to receive many letters from readers reflecting that some colleges and universities have unplanned teaching, school leaders do not conduct in-depth work, and there is a lack of democratic atmosphere within the school, resulting in many problems in teaching and administration. Some readers from art colleges reflect that some chaotic phenomena have occurred in school work due to the school's unclear school-running guidelines and the leadership's errors of being ambitious and unrealistic. We plan to publish some of the above letters in summary, and the rest will be forwarded to the relevant leading organs for inspection and handling. Some readers have also written to reflect that the school buildings of some primary schools in some areas urgently need to be repaired, but the local leading organs are delaying the issuance of repair funds, resulting in the collapse of school buildings and the death of students; this issue deserves attention, but the situations described in the letters are generally too simple, and we have replied to the readers asking them to supplement the materials. Readers reflect that the cultural centers in some areas do not purchase books according to the needs of the masses and that the library management system is chaotic, which weakens the cultural centers' role in serving the masses; we are studying this issue and hope that readers will continue to reflect the situation.

Many readers have reflected in their letters the lack of planned training for apprentice technicians in some factories and mines; they have exposed the situation in which some industrial and construction units neglect safe production and cause accidents; they have exposed the situation in which some factories and mines fail to complete production plans and waste national resources due to the bureaucracy of the leadership; they have reflected the serious backlog in the freight work of some stations; we are studying and handling all of the above issues.

In addition, we have forwarded readers' inquiries about how to handle the summer people's student aid fund to the leading organs for answers. We have forwarded the suggestions made by readers on the work of secondary school enrollment to the Central Ministry of Education for reference. We have forwarded the readers' reflections on the chaotic order and unscientific ticket sales methods of some stations to the relevant railway units for reference. We have comprehensively forwarded some of the questions and opinions raised by readers after the Ministry of Railways adjusted the scope and methods of transporting goods as parcels to the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government for handling, and will not answer the readers individually.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    中央粮食部在调拨粮食时应明确规定粮食作价办法
    河南省粮食厅刘勋、吕兆炳、陈永杰来信：中央粮食部经营管理司推销科处理调拨粮食作价问题很混乱，使下级粮食公司的工作增加了困难。如七月份山西、绥远、内蒙、东北等地调入河南粮食一批，我们用电话向该科请示这些粮食应如何作价。该科答复说：“这批粮食都是在计划以内的，也合乎流转方向，可按接方价格作价。”我们就根据这一指示到各发粮地签订调拨合同，但山西省粮食厅要按发方价格作价。我厅又请示该科，该科又指示说：“为了完成调拨任务，就按他们那边的价格作价吧！”我们又问：“要是绥远、内蒙、东北也都要按发方价格作价呢？”该科的答复是：“你们先提出按接方价格作价与他们订合同吧，订成就算了，订不成时就也改按发方价格作价。”
    由于中央粮食部经营管理司推销科对内部粮食调拨作价问题经常是这样不统一，使我们工作发生很多困难。我们在答复下级粮食机关的问题时也只好跟着朝令夕改，和省外洽谈时也没有一定根据；结果，调拨粮食时要确定作价办法总得经过不少周折。
    我们希望中央粮食部检查和改进这个工作，今后对各地粮食机关布置调拨任务时，应随时将作价办法明文下达。
    湖南、江西某些粮食部门
    调粮计划不周积压运输工具
    中南粮食调运委员会陈志清来信：湖南、江西两省某些地区的粮食部门在粮食调运工作中计划不周，粮源摆布不匀，或没有充分发动群众把分散在交通不便地区粮库的粮食及时集中到交通沿线，以致造成积压运输工具的现象，浪费了国家的运输力量。如湖南省浏阳县粮食局在今年第一季度因有船无粮而积压民船五千三百八十一吨，有的积压达四十天之久，使两千多名船工及其家属生活发生困难，该局并被罚支付延宕费一亿八千二百万元；五月中旬，该局又积压了民船四十八只。江西省吉安专区粮食局在今年三月底、四月初，因计划不周而发生以船代仓事件，把九十六只民船（共一千二百五十七吨）积压了十四天到二十天。此外，湖南省辰溪、安江和洪江等地在五月份积压船只八千余吨，桂阳县也因粮食集运不及时而积压汽车三十九辆。
    为了提高运输工具的周转率，加速完成粮食调运任务，保障船工及其家属的生活，建议各级粮食部门和运输部门加强工作中的计划性，纠正上述积压运输工具的现象。
    庐江县粮食局盲目编制计划往返调运粮食浪费运输费用
    安徽省芜湖专区粮食局陆新国来信：安徽省庐江县粮食局在去年冬天和今年春天盲目地大量外调存粮；而到今年第二季度开始，当地却又因粮食缺少，从巢县、无为县等地调入粮食。该县第二季度需要从外地调入的粮食数量，占当初调出数量的三分之一。这样一进一出，浪费的运输费用估计在五亿余元左右。
    造成粮食往返调运的主要原因，是庐江县粮食局计划股对工作不负责任，不了解实际情况就闭门造车地编制供销计划；该县粮食局领导人和芜湖专区粮食局计划课又对该股计划不作严格审查，就轻率批准。希望他们能对这件事进行检查，从中吸取教训，以改进今后供销计划工作。
    南京市地方国营新宁砖瓦厂违反基本建设程序造成浪费
    读者缪杰来信：南京市地方工业局所属新宁砖瓦厂，在基本建设计划未经批准以前，盲目扩建，造成了国家财富的损失。
    南京市今年基本建设工程较去年增多了，砖瓦的需要量也增加了。但是南京现有的砖瓦窑很多，已投入生产的尚未充分发挥潜在生产能力，没有投入生产的还有一百多座；因此，目前并无增建新设备的必要。新宁砖瓦厂不去了解这些情况，在基本建设计划未经上级批准之前，就盲目地发展了二百多个工人，建造倒焰窑十座。到三月中旬工程完成了百分之四十以上。这时，地方工业局指出该厂违反基本建设程序，通知停工。新宁砖瓦厂对他们的错误并未及时设法补救，对已进行的工程也不妥善处理。三个月来，仅因风雨侵袭而使各窑坑土方倒塌的损失即达人民币一千九百万元左右。
    我建议南京市财经委员会和地方工业局对这件事进行彻底检查，并作适当处理，以便从中吸取教训，免使国家财产再受类似损失。
    两周读者来信处理情况
    七月二十日到八月二日两周中，本报读者来信组共收到读者来信二千六百五十件，各机关答复读者信六百六十件。其中有关政法问题的一千一百六十五件，有关工农业生产和财经问题的一千一百六十件，有关文教问题的九百二十七件，其它性质的五十八件。在报上发表的一百二十三件，个别答复读者的七百七十九件，转请各有关机关调查、研究、处理或答复的一千二百三十九件，留存本报参考或不需再作答复的一千零七十六件；其余的正在处理中。同一时期，本报读者来信组共发出答复读者、转请有关机关研究处理和催办信共三千四百二十九件。
    朝鲜停战协定签字后，广大读者纷纷来信表示热烈拥护，决心以实际行动为进一步争取朝鲜问题的和平解决而努力；并指出要继续提高警惕，监督对方切实遵守协定，防止一切破坏行为。这些来信，我们已经选择一部分在报上发表。
    两周来，我们收到不少读者来信反映：各地的优抚工作，由于人民政府的重视和广大群众的努力，都取得了巨大的成绩；但也有某些地区的领导机关对优抚工作不够重视，致使少数烈军属和革命残废军人等的生活和生产发生困难。以上来信，我们除已摘要发表一部分外，其余的正在研究处理中；希望读者继续来信反映这方面的情况和问题。
    我们继续收到不少读者来信反映：某些大专学校教学无计划、学校领导干部工作不深入以及校内民主空气缺乏，以致在教学行政工作中出现了不少问题。有些艺术专科学校的读者反映：由于学校办学方针不明确和领导方面有好高鹜远的错误思想，造成了学校工作中的一些混乱现象。以上来信，我们准备摘要发表一部分，其余的即转请有关领导机关检查处理。还有一些读者来信反映某些地区有一部分小学的校舍急需抢修，而当地领导机关拖延不发修理经费，以致发生校舍倒塌压死学生的事件；这个问题是值得重视的，但来信中所述情况一般都太简单，我们已复信请读者补充材料。读者反映某些地区的文化馆不根据群众需要购置图书以及图书管理制度混乱，使文化馆削弱了为群众服务的作用；这个问题我们正在研究，希望读者继续反映情况。
    不少读者在来信中反映了某些厂矿对见习技术员缺乏有计划的培养的问题；揭发了某些工业和建筑单位忽视安全生产而造成事故的情况；揭发了某些厂矿由于领导方面的官僚主义而造成生产计划没有完成和浪费国家资财的情况；反映了某些车站货运工作中有严重积压情况；以上问题，我们都正在研究处理。
    此外，读者来信询问有关暑期人民助学金如何处理的问题，我们已转请领导机关解答。读者对中等学校招生工作所提建议，我们已转请中央教育部参考。读者反映某些车站秩序混乱、售票方法不科学等情况，我们已转请各有关铁路单位参考。读者在铁道部调整货物按包裹运输的范围和办法后提出的一些问题和意见，我们已综合转请中央人民政府铁道部处理，不再个别答复读者。
