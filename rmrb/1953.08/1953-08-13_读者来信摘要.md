Reader's Letters Summary

The Central Food Ministry Should Clearly Stipulate Grain Pricing Methods When Allocating Grain

Letters from Liu Xun, LÃ¼ Zhaobing, and Chen Yongjie of the Henan Provincial Food Bureau: The Sales Section of the Operations and Management Department of the Central Food Ministry is very chaotic in handling grain allocation pricing issues, which has increased the difficulty of the work of lower-level food companies. For example, in July, a batch of grain was transferred to Henan from Shanxi, Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia, and the Northeast. We called the section to inquire how this grain should be priced. The section replied: "This batch of grain is within the plan and conforms to the flow direction, so it can be priced according to the receiving party's price." Based on this instruction, we signed allocation contracts with various grain-issuing locations, but the Shanxi Provincial Food Bureau wanted to price it according to the issuing party's price. Our bureau consulted the section again, and the section instructed: "In order to complete the allocation task, price it according to their price!" We asked: "What if Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia, and the Northeast also want to price it according to the issuing party's price?" The section's reply was: "First, propose pricing according to the receiving party's price and sign contracts with them. If it works, great. If not, then change to pricing according to the issuing party's price."

Because the Sales Section of the Operations and Management Department of the Central Food Ministry often has such inconsistent pricing for internal grain allocation, our work has encountered many difficulties. When answering questions from lower-level food agencies, we have to follow the constantly changing instructions, and we have no definite basis when negotiating with other provinces. As a result, determining the pricing method for grain allocation always requires a lot of twists and turns.

We hope that the Central Food Ministry will inspect and improve this work. In the future, when assigning allocation tasks to grain agencies in various regions, the pricing method should be clearly communicated in writing.

Certain Grain Departments in Hunan and Jiangxi

Poor Grain Transfer Planning Leads to a Backlog of Transportation Tools

Letter from Chen Zhiqing of the Central and Southern China Grain Transfer Committee: The grain departments in some areas of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces have poor planning in grain transfer work, uneven distribution of grain sources, or have not fully mobilized the masses to promptly concentrate grain from warehouses in areas with inconvenient transportation to areas along transportation lines, resulting in a backlog of transportation tools and wasting national transportation resources. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the Liuyang County Grain Bureau in Hunan Province had 5,381 tons of civilian boats idled due to having boats but no grain, some for as long as forty days, causing difficulties in the lives of more than 2,000 boatmen and their families. The bureau was fined 182.2 million yuan in demurrage fees. In mid-May, the bureau had another forty-eight civilian boats idled. The Ji'an Special District Grain Bureau in Jiangxi Province, due to poor planning, had a situation of using boats as warehouses at the end of March and the beginning of April this year, idling ninety-six civilian boats (totaling 1,257 tons) for fourteen to twenty days. In addition, Chenxi, Anjiang, and Hongjiang in Hunan Province had more than 8,000 tons of boats idled in May, and Guiyang County also had thirty-nine trucks idled due to untimely grain collection and transportation.

In order to improve the turnover rate of transportation tools, accelerate the completion of grain transfer tasks, and ensure the lives of boatmen and their families, it is recommended that grain and transportation departments at all levels strengthen planning in their work and correct the above-mentioned phenomenon of stockpiling transportation tools.

Lujiang County Grain Bureau Blindly Creates Plans, Wasting Transportation Costs by Transferring Grain Back and Forth

Letter from Lu Xinguo of the Wuhu Special District Grain Bureau in Anhui Province: The Lujiang County Grain Bureau in Anhui Province blindly transferred a large amount of grain out last winter and spring. However, starting in the second quarter of this year, the local area lacked grain and transferred grain from Chaoxian and Wuwei counties. The amount of grain that the county needed to transfer in from other places in the second quarter accounted for one-third of the amount initially transferred out. This back-and-forth transfer wasted transportation costs estimated at over 500 million yuan.

The main reason for the back-and-forth transfer of grain is that the planning section of the Lujiang County Grain Bureau is irresponsible in its work and creates supply and sales plans behind closed doors without understanding the actual situation. The leaders of the county grain bureau and the planning section of the Wuhu Special District Grain Bureau did not strictly review the section's plan and approved it rashly. It is hoped that they can inspect this matter, learn a lesson from it, and improve future supply and sales planning work.

Nanjing Municipal State-Owned Xinning Brick and Tile Factory Violates Basic Construction Procedures, Causing Waste

Letter from reader Miao Jie: The Xinning Brick and Tile Factory, under the Nanjing Municipal Local Industry Bureau, blindly expanded before the basic construction plan was approved, causing losses to national wealth.

Nanjing has more basic construction projects this year than last year, and the demand for bricks and tiles has also increased. However, there are many existing brick and tile kilns in Nanjing, and those that have been put into production have not fully utilized their potential production capacity, and there are still more than one hundred that have not been put into production. Therefore, there is currently no need to add new equipment. The Xinning Brick and Tile Factory did not understand these circumstances and blindly developed more than 200 workers and built ten down-draft kilns before the basic construction plan was approved by the higher authorities. By mid-March, the project was more than 40% complete. At this time, the Local Industry Bureau pointed out that the factory had violated basic construction procedures and ordered it to stop work. The Xinning Brick and Tile Factory did not take timely remedial measures for their mistakes, nor did they properly handle the completed projects. In the past three months, the loss due to the collapse of the kiln pit earthworks due to wind and rain alone has reached approximately 19 million yuan.

I suggest that the Nanjing Municipal Finance and Economics Committee and the Local Industry Bureau conduct a thorough inspection of this matter and make appropriate arrangements in order to learn a lesson from it and prevent similar losses to state property.

Reader's Letters Handling Status for Two Weeks

From July 20th to August 2nd, the reader's letters group of this newspaper received a total of 2,650 reader's letters and the various agencies replied to 660 reader's letters. Among them, 1,165 were related to political and legal issues, 1,160 were related to industrial and agricultural production and financial issues, 927 were related to cultural and educational issues, and 58 were of other natures. One hundred and twenty-three were published in the newspaper, 779 were answered individually to the readers, 1,239 were transferred to relevant agencies for investigation, research, handling, or reply, and 1,076 were kept by this newspaper for reference or did not need to be answered again; the rest are being processed. During the same period, the reader's letters group of this newspaper issued a total of 3,429 replies to readers, requests to relevant agencies for research and handling, and follow-up letters.

After the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the vast number of readers wrote to express their warm support and their determination to strive for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue with practical actions; they also pointed out that we must continue to be vigilant, supervise the other party to earnestly abide by the agreement, and prevent all sabotage. We have selected some of these letters and published them in the newspaper.

In the past two weeks, we have received many letters from readers reflecting that the work of preferential treatment in various regions has achieved great results due to the importance attached to it by the people's government and the efforts of the vast masses; however, the leading organs in some regions do not pay enough attention to the work of preferential treatment, resulting in difficulties in the lives and production of a small number of family members of revolutionary martyrs and disabled revolutionary soldiers. In addition to publishing some of the above letters in summary, we are studying and processing the rest; we hope that readers will continue to write to reflect the situation and problems in this regard.

We continue to receive many letters from readers reflecting that some colleges and universities have unplanned teaching, school leaders do not conduct in-depth work, and there is a lack of democratic atmosphere within the school, resulting in many problems in teaching and administration. Some readers from art colleges reflect that some chaotic phenomena have occurred in school work due to the school's unclear school-running guidelines and the leadership's errors of being ambitious and unrealistic. We plan to publish some of the above letters in summary, and the rest will be forwarded to the relevant leading organs for inspection and handling. Some readers have also written to reflect that the school buildings of some primary schools in some areas urgently need to be repaired, but the local leading organs are delaying the issuance of repair funds, resulting in the collapse of school buildings and the death of students; this issue deserves attention, but the situations described in the letters are generally too simple, and we have replied to the readers asking them to supplement the materials. Readers reflect that the cultural centers in some areas do not purchase books according to the needs of the masses and that the library management system is chaotic, which weakens the cultural centers' role in serving the masses; we are studying this issue and hope that readers will continue to reflect the situation.

Many readers have reflected in their letters the lack of planned training for apprentice technicians in some factories and mines; they have exposed the situation in which some industrial and construction units neglect safe production and cause accidents; they have exposed the situation in which some factories and mines fail to complete production plans and waste national resources due to the bureaucracy of the leadership; they have reflected the serious backlog in the freight work of some stations; we are studying and handling all of the above issues.

In addition, we have forwarded readers' inquiries about how to handle the summer people's student aid fund to the leading organs for answers. We have forwarded the suggestions made by readers on the work of secondary school enrollment to the Central Ministry of Education for reference. We have forwarded the readers' reflections on the chaotic order and unscientific ticket sales methods of some stations to the relevant railway units for reference. We have comprehensively forwarded some of the questions and opinions raised by readers after the Ministry of Railways adjusted the scope and methods of transporting goods as parcels to the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government for handling, and will not answer the readers individually.
