Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 25th: Polish newspapers published on August 24th the statement of the Government of the Polish People's Republic regarding the German question. The statement says:

"The Government of the Polish People's Republic welcomes with great satisfaction the decisions of the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the German question.

The purpose of these decisions is to ensure a lasting peace in Europe, to shatter the imperialists' conspiracy to turn West Germany into a dangerous hotbed of new war, and to establish a unified, democratic and peace-loving Germany.

These decisions are of great importance to all peoples, especially to the Polish people who border Germany and have repeatedly suffered from German militarist aggression.

These decisions strengthen Poland's security, strike at the evil conspiracies of the new Hitlerites, revanchists, advocates of border revisions, and their masters, and consolidate the peaceful and democratic forces throughout Germany, as specifically embodied in the German Democratic Republic.

In view of the fact that Germany has paid a considerable portion of the reparations and that the improvement of the German economic situation is in the interest of Germany's peaceful development, the Government of the Polish People's Republic, in an effort to further contribute to the peaceful and democratic solution of the German question, has decided, in accordance with the interests of the Polish people and all peace-loving people, to cease collecting the reparations due to Poland as of January 1, 1954.

The Polish government shares the same confidence as the Soviet government: these decisions will not only fundamentally help the German people consolidate their economy, but also create the necessary preconditions for restoring unity and establishing a unified and democratic Germany, which the Polish people are closely concerned with."

    波兰政府就德国问题发表声明
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社华沙二十四日讯：波兰报纸于八月二十四日刊载了波兰人民共和国政府关于德国问题的声明。声明说：
    “波兰人民共和国政府非常满意地欢迎苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府关于德国问题的决定。
    这些决定的目的在于保证欧洲的巩固的和平，粉碎帝国主义者变西德为新战争的危险温床的阴谋，并建立一个统一、民主与爱好和平的德国。
    这些决定对于各国人民，特别是对于与德国为邻，而且曾多次身受德国军国主义侵略之害的波兰人民是非常重要的。
    这些决定加强了波兰的安全，打击了新希特勒分子、复仇主义分子、主张修改疆界的分子以及他们的主子的罪恶阴谋，并在整个德国巩固了以德意志民主共和国为具体表现的和平民主力量。
    鉴于德国已经偿付了相当大部分的赔偿费，以及德国经济情况的改进符合于德国和平发展的利益，波兰人民共和国政府为力求对以和平与民主精神解决德国问题有进一步贡献，按照波兰人民以及所有爱好和平人民的利益，已决定自一九五四年一月一日起，停止收取波兰应得的赔偿费。
    波兰政府与苏联政府具有同样的信心：这些决定将不仅根本地帮助德国人民巩固他们的经济，而且创造必要的先决条件来恢复统一，并建立一个波兰人民所密切关怀的统一与民主的德国。”
