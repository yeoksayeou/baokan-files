    Grand Air Show Held in Moscow
    Chairman Malenkov and Other Party and Government Leaders Attend the Review
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 24th] According to TASS, Moscow: The annual Aviation Day parade was held on August 23rd at Tushino Airfield near Moscow. (Note: This year's Moscow Aviation Day parade was originally scheduled for August 9th, but was postponed to August 23rd due to weather conditions.)
    From early morning, thousands of Muscovites, dressed in festive attire, flocked to the famous Chkalov Central Aviation Club airfield. The airfield was a scene of celebration.
    At 12 noon, the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government: G.M. Malenkov, V.M. Molotov, N.S. Khrushchev, K.Y. Voroshilov, N.A. Bulganin, L.M. Kaganovich, A.I. Mikoyan, M.Z. Saburov, M.G. Pervukhin, as well as members of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, ministers of government departments, and marshals and generals of the Soviet Army and Navy, ascended the reviewing stand. They were warmly welcomed by the masses.
    Then, the cannon sounded, announcing the start of the review. The melody of the Soviet national anthem resonated in the air. All eyes turned to the sky. Soon, nineteen light aircraft swept over the airfield. The lead plane carried a red flag bearing the images of V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin. The other planes carried the flags of the sixteen Soviet republics. Then, a large group of planes flew over, spelling out the words "Glory to the Soviet Union" in the sky.
    The review program was divided into three parts. The first part of the program began with a performance by amateur pilots from the Soviet Union's Army, Navy and Air Force Assistance Association. Five female pilots, including Soviet record holder Marina Chechneva, performed aerobatics. They performed complex stunts. This was followed by a performance by amateur glider pilots, students from the Moscow Aviation Institute. Five huge gliders flew in the sky like gulls with white wings. They dived down, close to the ground, then suddenly turned upwards again, as if seeking shelter in the sky, eliciting constant praise from the masses. After the glider pilots' performance, amateur aircraft pilots performed. In collective flights, they demonstrated skilled techniques, performing horizontal circling flights, aerial formations, loops and half-loops, aileron rolls, and more with high accuracy and coordinated movements.
    The second part of the program began with a technical demonstration by air force pilots. A small black dot appeared on the horizon, and in an instant, a jet fighter piloted by Major Lapshin was flying over the airfield. It was very difficult to keep an eye on this aircraft, as it sometimes rushed into the sky like lightning, and sometimes swept over the airfield like a whirlwind, performing a series of stunts: side flight, two-circle aileron roll, and so on. After Major Lapshin's plane flew past, four groups of jet fighters flew in succession. The planes flew in formation, with the front group and the three rear groups flying in close formation, with no plane deviating from the formation by a meter. Seeing the pilots' superb skills and the increasingly perfect designs of the aircraft designed by Soviet designers, the masses were mesmerized, and they expressed their admiration with enthusiastic applause. As the second program neared its end, jet bombers and jet fighters performed, sweeping over the airfield in formation, the rumble of which shook the air. This performance demonstrated the achievements of Soviet aircraft technology and the strength of the Soviet Air Force, which is protecting the peaceful construction work of the Soviet people.
    The final part of the program included a large group of helicopters flying to the airfield accompanied by fighter planes, beginning a landing performance. They landed lightly on the green airfield like birds. After the helicopters dropped off some motorcycles and motorbikes, they lightly ascended into the sky again. As the time approached one o'clock, the audience eagerly awaited the moment of mass parachuting. An entire team of giant aircraft flew over the airfield. At regular intervals, indistinguishable human figures jumped from each aircraft. As if by magic, the parachutes above each human figure suddenly opened. All at once, the entire sky above the airfield was filled with colorful parachutes, slowly drifting to the ground with the wind like countless beautiful light balloons.
    The aviation review at Tushino Airfield became a grand people's celebration, demonstrating the skilled techniques of Soviet pilots and the latest achievements of Soviet aircraft technology.

    莫斯科举行航空节盛大检阅
    马林科夫主席等党政领袖出席检阅
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：八月二十三日，在莫斯科附近的土希诺飞机场上举行了一年一度的航空节检阅。（按：今年莫斯科的航空节检阅原订于八月九日举行，后因气候关系改在二十三日举行）
    从清晨起，数以千计的莫斯科人，穿着节日的盛装涌向著名的奇卡洛夫中央航空俱乐部飞机场。飞机场上一片节日景象。
    正午十二时，苏联共产党和政府的领袖：格·马·马林科夫，维·米·莫洛托夫，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫，克·叶·伏罗希洛夫，尼·亚·布尔加宁，拉·莫·卡冈诺维奇，阿·伊·米高扬，马·扎·萨布罗夫，米·格·别尔乌辛，以及苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员，政府各部部长，苏联陆军和海军元帅、将军们走上了检阅台。他们受到群众的热烈欢迎。
    接着，宣布检阅开始的炮声响了。苏联国歌的旋律在空气中荡漾。所有观众的眼睛都转向天空。不一会，十九架轻便飞机掠过飞机场的上空。领头的飞机带着有乌·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林像的红旗。其他的飞机带着苏联十六个加盟共和国的国旗。接着又飞过一大群飞机，它们在空中拼出了“苏联光荣”几个大字。
    检阅节目分三部分。第一部分节目开始时，由苏联陆海空军促进协会的业余飞行人员表演。包括苏联纪录创造者马丽娜·契奇涅娃在内的五个女飞行员表演翻筋斗。她们表演了复杂的特技飞行。接着是业余滑翔机驾驶员、莫斯科航空学院的学生表演。五架巨大的滑翔机像张着白翼的鸥鸟一般在天空飞翔。它们俯冲下来，一直到贴近地面的时候，突然又翻身向上，好像要到天空中去寻找隐避所似的，引起了群众不绝的赞美。在滑翔机驾驶员表演后，由业余飞机驾驶员表演。他们在集体飞行中表现出了熟练的技术，用高度的准确性和配合动作表演了水平盘旋飞行、空中圆阵飞行，表演了翻筋斗和半筋斗、横滚等等。
    第二部分节目开始时是空军驾驶员的技术表演。一个小小的黑点出现在地平线上，顷刻之间，由拉普兴少校驾驶的喷气式战斗机就飞在机场上空了。要目不转睛地盯住这架飞机是非常困难的，因为它时而像闪电似地冲入云霄，时而像旋风似地掠过机场，表演了一连串的特技飞行：侧飞、两圈横滚等等。拉普兴少校的飞机飞过去后，先后飞来了四群喷气战斗机。这些飞机前面一群，后面三群结队飞行，没有一架离开队形一公尺。看到驾驶员的卓越的技术和苏联设计师所设计的飞机的日趋完善的式样，群众们都着了迷，他们用热烈的掌声表示他们的赞美。第二个节目将近结束时，喷气轰炸机和喷气战斗机表演节目，它们一队一队地掠过机场，隆隆之声把空气都震动了。这种表演显示了苏联飞机技术的成就和正在保卫着苏联人民的和平建设劳动的苏联空军的力量。
    最后一部分节目包括由一大群直升飞机在战斗机的陪伴下飞抵机场，开始作降落表演。它们像鸟一样轻盈地降落在绿色的机场上。这批直升机把一些机器脚踏车和摩托车放下后，又轻盈地升入空中了。当时间将近一点钟的时候，观众们热切地等待着的大规模跳伞的时刻来临了。一整队的巨型飞机飞临机场上空。每隔一定时间就从每架飞机上跳出难以分辨的人形。好像变魔术似的，每个人形上面的一个个降落伞突然张开了。一下子，整个机场上空布满了五色缤纷的降落伞，像无数美丽的轻汽球一样慢慢地随风飘向地面。
    土希诺飞机场上的航空检阅成了盛大的人民庆典，它显示了苏联驾驶员的熟练技术和苏联飞机技术的最新成就。
