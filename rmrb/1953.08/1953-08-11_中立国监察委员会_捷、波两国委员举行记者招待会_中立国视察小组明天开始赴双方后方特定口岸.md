Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 10th: The Czechoslovak member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, Lieutenant General Blech, and the Polish member, Major General Ungerowski, jointly held a press conference in Kaesong on the morning of the 10th. At the meeting, they represented the personnel from their respective countries participating in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, stating that they would strive to complete the glorious tasks assigned to them by the Korean Armistice Agreement and their respective governments, in order to help create peace in Korea and consolidate world peace. More than 20 journalists from Korea, China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy attended the press conference.

	Lieutenant General Blech said: The Korean armistice is a major step towards peace. We will strive to complete all tasks in order to create peace in Korea. To better accomplish our tasks, it is first necessary to quickly dispatch Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed at ports in both rear areas, which requires resolving a series of issues to ensure that the work of the teams is not disrupted and that they can better fulfill their mission. I believe this work will be completed soon.

	Major General Ungerowski said: The basis of the work of our Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its teams is its objectivity, and the purpose of our work is to faithfully supervise the observance of the Armistice Agreement, thereby serving the people of all countries. Now, we are making every effort to ensure that the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams can depart as soon as possible, and through their work, serve world peace and freedom.

	Before the end of the press conference, the Czechoslovak and Polish members answered questions raised by the journalists and introduced the press officers of the two delegations to meet with the journalists from various countries.

	Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 10th: The ten Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to be dispatched to designated ports in both rear areas are scheduled to depart on the 12th or 13th. At its meeting on the 10th, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission decided in principle that all ten teams would depart on the 12th. However, because the Swedish member notified that the rear area port of South Korea under US control might not be ready, it was later decided that if they could not depart on the 12th, they would depart on the 13th.

	The Czechoslovak and Polish members believe that there are six points in the US side's written responses to various issues and requests related to the work of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams that are unsatisfactory. However, in order to prevent further delays in the departure date of the teams, they agreed to dispatch the teams first and then discuss these issues.

	The Korean-Chinese side provided clear and affirmative answers to various issues and requests related to the work of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams on the 6th, and provided specific guarantees. After the Czechoslovak and Polish members raised a written response on the 10th, all members expressed satisfaction.

	The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has decided to continue discussing the various issues that the US side has not yet satisfactorily answered at the meeting on the 11th.

    中立国监察委员会
    捷、波两国委员举行记者招待会
    中立国视察小组明天开始赴双方后方特定口岸
    【新华社开城十日电】中立国监察委员会的捷克斯洛伐克委员布莱希中将和波兰委员翁格洛夫斯基少将，于十日上午在开城联合举行记者招待会。他们在会上分别代表参加中立国监察委员会工作的本国人员表示，他们将努力完成朝鲜停战协定和本国政府所赋予的光荣任务，以有助于缔造朝鲜和平及巩固世界和平。参加记者招待会的有朝鲜、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、英国、法国和意大利等国的新闻记者二十多人。
    布莱希中将说：朝鲜停战是走向和平的很大的一步。我们将努力完成一切任务，以便缔造朝鲜的和平。为了更好地完成我们的任务，首先需要迅速派出驻在双方后方口岸的中立国视察小组，而这就必须解决一系列的问题，以使小组的工作不致遭到破坏，并能更好地完成它们的使命。我相信这一工作不久即将完成。
    翁格洛夫斯基少将说：我们中立国监察委员会及其小组的工作的依据，就是它的客观性，我们的工作的目的就是忠实地监督停战协定的被遵守，以此来服务于各国人民。现在，我们正尽一切力量使中立国视察小组能早日出发，通过他们的工作来为世界和平与自由服务。
    在记者招待会结束前，捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员答复了记者们提出的问题，并介绍两国代表团的新闻发布人员与各国记者见面。
    【新华社开城十日电】派赴双方后方特定口岸的十个中立国视察小组，已预定在十二日或十三日出发。中立国监察委员会在十日会议上决定，原则上十个小组均在十二日出发，但因为瑞典委员通知恐美方控制下的南朝鲜后方口岸准备不及，后来决定如十二日不能出发时则在十三日出发。
    捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员认为，美方对有关中立国视察小组工作的各项问题与要求的书面答复中有六点不能满意，但为了使小组出发日期不再迟延，同意先行派出小组，然后再对这些问题进行讨论。
    朝中方面对有关中立国视察小组工作的各项问题与要求，在六日即已提出明确和肯定的答复，并提出了具体保证。我方在十日经过捷克斯洛伐克和波兰的委员提出了书面答复，全体委员都表示满意。
    中立国监察委员会已决定在十一日的会议上，对美方尚未圆满答复的各项问题继续进行讨论。
