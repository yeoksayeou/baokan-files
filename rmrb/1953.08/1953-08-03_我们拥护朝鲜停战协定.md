    We Support the Korean Armistice Agreement
    Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China

    The Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed, and the Korean armistice, which people around the world who love peace have longed for, has finally been realized. This is a great victory for the people of Korea and China in resisting aggression, defending peace, and persisting in striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue through consultation and negotiation; it is also the result of the continuous efforts of peace-loving people all over the world to strive for peace. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement convincingly demonstrates that any international dispute can and must be resolved through consultation, and this victory is a tremendous encouragement to the cause of peace pursued by peace-loving people all over the world.

    The Red Cross Society of China has consistently adhered to the principles of maintaining world peace and upholding humanitarianism, and has made every effort it could in this Korean War. We have organized several international medical and epidemic prevention service teams to go to Korea to carry out preventive medical work for the Korean people, and have treated wounded and sick prisoners of war from the enemy side; at every international Red Cross conference we have attended, we have insisted on maintaining peace and humanitarianism, hoping that the Korean War could end as soon as possible, so that the Korean people could be spared from the disasters of war, and that all prisoners of war could return to their homes and live a peaceful life.

    Therefore, members of the Red Cross Society of China are extremely excited to enthusiastically support the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and will continue to make unremitting efforts to engage in activities to maintain peace and humanitarianism, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of Article 3 "Arrangements Regarding Prisoners of War" in the "Agreement on the Korean Military Armistice," send representatives to participate in the Joint Red Cross Team to do a good job in assisting both sides in repatriating prisoners of war.

    Although the armistice agreement has been signed, a portion of warmongers in the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea are still openly clamoring against the armistice, attempting to undermine the armistice agreement. In response, we hope that the Red Cross Societies of the world will, upholding the position of maintaining peace and humanitarianism, join us in raising our vigilance and continue to work together for the complete realization of the Korean armistice and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    我们拥护朝鲜停战协定
    中国红十字会总会会长  李德全
    朝鲜停战协定签订了，全世界爱好和平的人民所渴望的朝鲜停战终于实现了。这是朝、中两国人民抵抗侵略、保卫和平和坚持争取通过协商谈判和平解决朝鲜问题的斗争的伟大胜利；这也是全世界爱好和平人民不断努力争取和平的结果。朝鲜停战协定的签订，令人信服地说明了：任何国际争端不仅可以而且必须用协商的方式来解决，同时这一胜利对于全世界爱好和平的人民所努力从事的和平事业是莫大的鼓舞。
    中国红十字会是一贯坚持维护世界和平和维护人道主义原则的，在这次朝鲜战争中曾做了它可能做到的努力。我们曾组织了若干个国际医防服务队赴朝鲜，为朝鲜人民进行预防医疗的工作，并曾治疗了敌方的伤病战俘；我们在每次所出席的国际性红十字会议上坚持维护和平及人道主义的主张，冀使朝鲜战争能早日结束，使朝鲜人民免于战争灾难，使所有的战俘都能重返家园过和平生活。
    因此，中国红十字会会员都以极其兴奋的心情热烈拥护朝鲜停战协定的签订，并将继续不懈地努力从事维护和平及人道主义的活动，按照“关于朝鲜军事停战的协定”中第三条“关于战俘的安排”的有关规定，派遣代表参加联合红十字会小组，做好协助双方遣返战俘的工作。
    停战协定虽然已经签订，但是美国的一部分好战分子与南朝鲜李承晚集团仍然公开叫嚣反对停战，企图破坏停战协定。对此，我们希望世界各国红十字会本维护和平及人道主义的立场，与我们一起提高警惕，并共同为朝鲜停战的彻底实现与和平解决朝鲜问题继续努力。
