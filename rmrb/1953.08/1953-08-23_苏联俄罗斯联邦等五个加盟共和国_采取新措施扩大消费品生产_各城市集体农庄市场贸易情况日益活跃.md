    In the Russian Federation, enterprises affiliated with the Ministry of Local Industry and the Ministry of Fuel Industry will increase the production of consumer goods by several hundred million rubles above the original target in the second half of this year. They plan to produce more than 700,000 silk garments and knitwear items, 500,000 pairs of felt boots, more than 30,000 children's bicycles, and more than 40,000 beds, among other things. The Federal Republic also pays attention to improving the quality of consumer goods and expanding their variety. This summer, industrial enterprises that participated in public consumer goods appraisal meetings held by local industries in various regions are manufacturing a variety of novel goods based on the suggestions of the masses. Local industrial enterprises near Moscow alone are producing 200 new products. To further increase the production of consumer goods, the Ministry of Local Industry and the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Federation plans to build and expand many factories. From now until the end of 1954, 34 furniture factories will be expanded and 46 new ones will be built.

    In Ukraine, the footwear industry will produce 8.5 million more pairs of shoes this year than in 1950. In the past two and a half years, Ukrainian shoe factories have installed 1,800 new types of machines.

The production of patent leather will double.

    In Kazakhstan, the cream and cheese industry continues to expand vigorously. The number of mechanized dairy product factories here is now twice that of 1940. By the end of 1955, 60 new dairy product factories will be established. The amount of milk purchased and the output of cream by dairy product factories are now almost double what they were in 1940, while the output of cheese has increased by 1.4 times.

    Factories in Kyrgyzstan that produce consumer goods have overfulfilled their original plans in the past two and a half years, and the output in the first half of this year increased by 60 million rubles compared with the same period last year. The Republic's Ministry of Light Industry and Food Industry plans to increase the output of various consumer goods by 76 percent during the Fifth Five-Year Plan period.

    The output of Georgia's silk weaving industry is also increasing. This year, 2.5 million more meters of silk fabrics will be produced than last year. The output of crepe de chine, crepe satin, and Xiangyun yarn has doubled. To further increase production, silk factories in Tbilisi, Kutaisi, and other parts of Georgia are promoting the method of mixing natural silk with rayon to weave new fabrics, and many new high-speed looms are also being used.
