Cadres in Some State-Owned Commercial Departments Should Overcome Complacency and Relaxed Thinking

In Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shenyang, Dalian and other places, the sales revenue of some state-owned commercial departments decreased significantly in July compared with the previous period. In the state-owned commercial system of Jilin Province, the average daily sales revenue in the first ten days of July decreased by 56% compared with the end of June, with cotton yarn and cloth decreasing by 53% and general merchandise decreasing by 57.2%. In Dalian, seven out of nine specialized companies saw their sales decline in the first ten days of July compared with the first ten days of June.

The main reason for the decline in sales revenue is that cadres in some units generally developed complacency and relaxation from the third quarter. Leading cadres of the Dalian Department Store believed that the commodity turnover plan for the second quarter had been overfulfilled, and the material preparation for the third quarter was "almost" done, so they relaxed their leadership and inspection of the implementation of sales plans in grassroots stores, and therefore, cadres and employees also relaxed. In addition, some leading cadres of state-owned commercial enterprises lack a strong planning concept, lack supervision and inspection of the implementation of plans at ordinary times, and are not good at appropriately arranging monthly, quarterly, and annual plans to connect with each other. Therefore, they are in a hurry at the end of each month and quarter, unable to first deploy the plans for the next month and next quarter, and promptly mobilize the masses to discuss. Some units did not start mobilizing employees to discuss the third quarter plan until July 20, and some units have not even deployed such a plan to date. In this way, the work of employees loses its target, and they become relaxed.

One of the most important signs of state-owned commerce serving production and consumers is to continuously and actively expand the promotion of industrial and agricultural products to meet the growing needs of the people's material and cultural life, so as to consolidate the worker-peasant economic alliance and promote the continuous upsurge of the national economy. After the country entered planned economic construction, it more strictly requires state-owned commerce to do so. At present, the peak trading season is approaching. This year's procurement and supply tasks of state-owned commerce are more arduous than in any previous year with the growth of the national economy and the expansion of commodity circulation. It requires all employees of the state-owned commercial system to overcome any complacency and relaxed thinking, step up preparations, and strive to meet the material supply tasks of the peak season, and ensure the timely completion of the state's monthly, quarterly, and annual commodity turnover plans and financial plans!

### 部分国营商业部门的干部应该克服自满和松劲的思想

    部分国营商业部门的干部应该克服自满和松劲的思想
    吉林、黑龙江、沈阳、旅大等地部分国营商业部门，七月份的卖钱额较前显著下降了。吉林省国营商业系统七月上旬每天的平均卖钱额比六月底下降百分之五十六，其中花纱布下降百分之五十三，百货下降百分之五十七点二。旅大市九个专业公司中有七个专业公司在七月上旬的销售额比六月上旬下降了。
    卖钱额下降的主要原因是某些单位的干部从第三季度开始普遍地产生了自满情绪和松劲现象。旅大市百货公司领导干部认为第二季度的商品流转计划已经超额完成了，第三季度的物资准备工作也“差不多”了，就放松了对基层商店执行销售计划的领导和检查，因此，干部和职工也就松劲了。另外还有一些国营商业的领导干部缺乏坚强的计划观念，平时对计划的执行情况缺乏监督和检查，也不善于把月份、季度与年度的计划适当地加以安排，使之互相衔接，因此每到月末、季末总结时就忙忙乱乱，不能先把下月、下季的计划布置下去，及时发动群众讨论。有的单位直到七月二十日才开始发动职工讨论第三季度的计划，有些单位甚至迄今还没有布置这种计划。这样，职工的工作丧失了目标，就松劲了。
    国营商业为生产和消费者服务的最重要的标志之一，就是不间断地积极扩大推销工农业产品，满足日益增长着的人民物质文化生活的需要，以便巩固工农经济联盟，促进国民经济的不断高涨。国家进入有计划的经济建设以后，更加严格地要求国营商业这样做。目前，贸易旺季就要到来，今年国营商业的收购、供应任务随着国民经济的增长和商品流通的扩大，比过去任何一年都更加繁重，它要求国营商业系统的全体职工，克服任何自满情绪和松劲思想，加紧准备，为迎接旺季的物资供应任务，保证按时完成国家的月份、季度、年度商品流转计划和财务计划而努力！
