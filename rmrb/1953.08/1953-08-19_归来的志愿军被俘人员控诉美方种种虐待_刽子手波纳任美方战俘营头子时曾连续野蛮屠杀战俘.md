Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 18th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who have been repatriated from U.S. POW camps are all weak and malnourished. Coarse barley rice, damp bedding, and a long life of slavery have caused 37% of the personnel to suffer from night blindness and 23% to suffer from arthritis. Repatriated prisoners of our side reported the following facts about the U.S. side's abuse of prisoners of war to reporters:

Our captured personnel lived in hunger for a long time. They could not receive a box of coarse grains every day, and they never had a full meal. Before August 1952, each person could only be given half a bowl of barley rice per meal. It was indigestible, and the stool still contained barley grains. After September, extremely coarse barley flakes were issued, but they were still deducted, and they were not enough to eat at all. The captured personnel could not eat green vegetables all year round, only a few dried vegetable leaves and rotten radishes that could not be bitten. There were no seasonings other than salt. Only for a very short period of time, canned food was issued, but only six five-pound cans were issued to every six hundred people per day, averaging six cents per person; in addition, a small amount of bad fish with maggots was issued. In the past year, not a drop of oil has been seen in the food. The U.S. military often did not supply fuel, so the vegetables and rice were half-cooked. Water was severely restricted. In 1951, the 12,000 people in the 72nd Regiment of Koje Island had only one half-inch diameter water pipe for water supply, which was not enough for cooking, let alone drinking. In 1952, in the eighth prisoner of war camp on Jeju Island, although there was a water pipe in each barbed wire enclosure, it was only open for six hours a day, and the U.S. military often deducted food and water under various pretexts. From July 7 to 9, 1952, the U.S. military stopped supplying food and water to 600 people in the No. 2 barbed wire enclosure without any reason. At that time, the weather was dry and hot, and everyone had not eaten food or water for three days. They were so thirsty and hungry that they wanted to dig underground sewage to quench their thirst. After seeing this, the U.S. military falsely claimed that the prisoners of war were about to escape, and shot and killed Zhang Donghai on the spot, and wounded Mao Youcai.

The U.S. military robbed the captured personnel of their personal belongings on the battlefield, including money, pens, watches, photos, commemorative medals, and the clothes, shoes, and socks they wore. Then, each person was given a set of tattered old clothes worn by the U.S. military and a pair of broken leather shoes. On July 26, 1951, the U.S. military forced the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war to wear bright red short clothes and trousers worn by ancient death row prisoners. This set of clothing was worn until the heavy snow fell. The cold sea breeze of Koje Island stung their bodies like sharp knives, and many people suffered from frostbite, but they still had to be driven to the seaside to do hard labor every day, carrying sand, hitting stones, moving goods, and repairing roads, often until late at night. In late December, each person received an old coat that was dirty and smelly. The U.S. military also often asked the prisoners of war to take off their clothes, trousers, shoes, and hats in the open air in the name of inspection and weighing, making them act naked outdoors.

The living conditions of our captured personnel were also very bad. Before November 1952, they had been sleeping on the damp ground, with only one mat and one thin blanket per person. In Busan, 250 people were squeezed into a tent, and each person could only get a place that was five feet long and four inches wide on average, and they could not turn over once they lay down. The air in the tent was turbid, and when it rained, the inside and outside were full of sewage. Sometimes they had to squat in the mud for several days and nights. As a result, most people suffered from scabies, rheumatism, and arthritis. There was no fire for heating for two winters. Only in January of this year, ten catties of coal for heating and two stoves were issued to every 75 people. The five catties of coal burned out in a short while after being put in. The captured personnel said that this was symbolic heating.

Our captured personnel were often persecuted. According to the five-day statistics from September 20 to 24, 1952, more than 200 prisoners of war in the first, second, and sixth barbed wire enclosures of the eighth prisoner of war camp on Jeju Island were stabbed one after another because they walked a little slower when they went out to do hard labor. In addition, the U.S. military treated the prisoners of war in transit with even more abuse. In May 1951, the U.S. military escorted 500 Volunteer Army prisoners of war to Busan. They were squeezed into the carriages, one next to the other, without food or drink for two days and nights, and many people fainted. On July 3 last year, 3,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war moved from Koje Island to Jeju Island, and the American army threw more than a dozen poison gas bombs and a bag of explosives at them. On August 4 this year, soon after the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war transported from Jeju Island to Incheon had eaten, 170 to 180 people suffered from abdominal pain, with severe vomiting and diarrhea, and 40 people lost their ability to speak as a result.

The U.S. side repeatedly claimed that they treat prisoners of war in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention, but the facts prove that they are thorough destroyers of the Geneva Convention.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 18th: "The Bonner Terror Period" - this is what our captured personnel call the period when the great executioner Bonner, who massacred prisoners of war, served as the commander of the U.S. prisoner of war camp. This period lasted from May 1952 to the end of September 1952. During this period, our captured personnel suffered extremely terrifying massacres and persecutions.

Song Long and Li Dongjiong, prisoners of the Korean People's Army who recently returned home, accused reporters of the most barbaric crime of the executioner Bonner - the massacre of prisoners of war in the 76th camp on Koje Island on June 10, 1952.

The prisoners of war on our side in the 76th prisoner of war camp on Koje Island once detained the U.S. prisoner of war camp commander Dodd on May 7, 1952, in order to oppose the U.S. side's forced detention and abuse of prisoners of war. After the executioner Bonner came to power, he regarded the 76th camp as a thorn in his side, and wanted to forcibly transfer the prisoners of the Korean People's Army in this camp to many small camps for persecution. Bonner had previously gathered two regiments of troops from the 25th U.S. Division and the 187th Airborne Regiment, as well as 22 tanks and 10 armored vehicles, and surrounded the 76th camp. At 7:00 a.m. on June 10, Bonner appeared on a lookout outside the 76th camp and said to the prisoners of war through a loudspeaker: If you don't obey my orders, I will kill you all! Then, the U.S. military's 60 guns began to fire into the camp. U.S. tanks rushed into the camp, crushing tents, barracks, and many of our captured personnel under the tracks. The U.S. infantry who followed the tanks also attacked our captured personnel with bayonets, grenades, poison gas bombs, and flamethrowers. Batches of our captured personnel fell one after another with their bare hands. The camp was filled with the sound of grenade explosions, gunshots, the angry shouts of our captured personnel, and the moans of the wounded. Song Long was wounded by a U.S. grenade at that time and fell to the ground. Touching the ground, he felt it was wet, all the fresh blood of our captured personnel. Speaking of this, he rolled up his trouser legs and showed the reporter two purplish-black scars on his left leg, which were the marks of the injuries he suffered at that time.

Faced with such an inhuman massacre, our captured personnel could no longer bear it, and rose up to defend themselves, fighting hand-to-hand with the barbaric U.S. soldiers. Bonner later投入了投入了 three more battalions of troops and continued the brutal massacre for three hours before finally driving our captured personnel out of the 76th camp. Li Dongjiong, a prisoner of the Korean People's Army who was repatriated, was walking at the end at that time. When he left, he also saw U.S. soldiers wearing gas masks using flamethrowers to massacre our captured personnel who were seriously injured and unable to move on the ground.

The executioner Bonner later announced that 170 prisoners of war were killed or injured in the massacre. But according to Song Long and Li Dongjiong, in fact, more than 570 of our captured personnel were killed or injured.

    归来的志愿军被俘人员控诉美方种种虐待
    刽子手波纳任美方战俘营头子时曾连续野蛮屠杀战俘
    【新华社开城十八日电】从美方战俘营遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员都身体瘦弱，缺乏营养。粗糙的大麦饭，潮湿的地铺，长期的奴隶生活，使得百分之三十七的人员害了夜盲症，百分之二十三的人得了关节炎。遣返归来的我方被俘人员向记者们报告了美方虐待战俘的以下种种事实。
    我方被俘人员长期在饥饿中度日。他们每天领不到一盒粗粮，从来没吃过一顿饱饭。在一九五二年八月以前，每人每顿仅可分到半碗大麦饭，吃后消化不了，大便出来仍是麦粒。九月以后，改发极粗糙的大麦片，但还被克扣，根本吃不饱。被俘人员们整年吃不到青菜，只有少数干菜叶和咬不动的烂萝卜，除盐以外，任何调料也没有。只是在很短的一个时期中，发过罐头，但是，每六百个人每天只发六个五磅重的罐头，每人平均六钱；此外，还发过少许生了蛆的坏鱼。近一年来，伙食中再没见过一滴油。美军经常不供给燃料，所以菜和饭都是半生不熟的。用水限制很严，一九五一年巨济岛七十二联队的一万二千人，只有一个直径半寸的水管供水，光煮饭都不够用，更谈不到饮用了。一九五二年，在济州岛的第八战俘营，虽然每个铁丝网围场里有一个水管，但每天只开放六小时，而且美军经常以各种藉口扣粮、扣水。一九五二年七月七日至九日，美军无故停发二号铁丝网围场中六百个人的粮食和水。当时天气燥热，大家三天没有吃到粮食和水，口焦喉干，饥渴难忍，便想挖地下污水解渴，美军看见后诬称战俘要逃跑，当场开枪打死张东海，打伤毛有才。
    美军在战场上，就抢光了被俘人员的私人财物，包括钱币、钢笔、手表、照片、纪念章以及随身穿的衣服鞋袜等。然后，发给每人一套美军穿过的、破烂不堪的旧衣服和一双破皮鞋。一九五一年七月二十六日，美军强制中国人民志愿军被俘人员穿上古代死囚所穿的鲜红色的短衣裤。这套服装，一直穿到大雪纷飞的时候。寒冷的巨济岛的海风，像锋利的刀子一样刺痛了他们的全身，很多人都生了冻疮，但他们每天还要被赶到海边去做苦工，抬沙子，打石头，搬货物，修路，经常要做到深夜。十二月下旬，每人才领到一件又脏又臭的旧大衣。美军还经常以检查、过磅为名，要被俘人员脱光衣裤鞋帽，使他们赤身露体在室外行动。
    我方被俘人员的居住条件也十分恶劣。在一九五二年十一月以前，一直睡在潮湿的地上，每人只有一条席和一床薄毯子。在釜山时，二百五十个人挤在一个帐篷里，每人平均只能分到五尺长、四寸宽的一块地方，一躺下就不能翻身。帐篷内空气污浊，一到下雨，里里外外全是污水，有时要在泥潭中蹲几昼夜，因此，大部分人患了疥疮、风湿症和关节炎。两个冬天没有火取暖。只在今年一月，每七十五人发过十斤烤火煤，两个火炉，五斤煤放进去一忽儿就烧完了。被俘人员们说，这是象征性的烤火。
    我方被俘人员经常遭受迫害。据一九五二年九月二十日至二十四日的五天统计：济州岛第八战俘营第一、二、六号铁丝网围场中的被俘人员外出做苦工，因为走得慢一点，先后就有二百多人被刺伤。此外，美军对转运途中的战俘也倍加虐待。一九五一年五月，美军押送五百个志愿军被俘人员去釜山，他们挤在车厢里，一个挨一个，两昼夜没有吃喝，许多人都昏倒了。去年七月三日，三千名中国人民志愿军被俘人员由巨济岛向济州岛移动，美国军队向他们投掷了十多枚毒气弹和一包炸药。今年八月四日，从济州岛运送至仁川的中国人民志愿军被俘人员在吃饭后不久，就有一百七、八十人发生腹痛，严重者上吐下泻，并有四十人因此失去说话能力。
    美方口口声声说他们对待战俘是遵守日内瓦公约的原则的，但是事实恰恰证明他们是日内瓦公约的彻底破坏者。
    【新华社开城十八日电】“波纳恐怖时期”——这是我方被俘人员对屠杀战俘的大刽子手波纳担任美方战俘营长官时期的称呼。这个时期从一九五二年五月一直延续到一九五二年九月底。在这个时期中，我方被俘人员曾遭到极为恐怖的屠杀和迫害。
    最近遣返归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员宋龙、李东烱，向记者们控诉了刽子手波纳的最野蛮的一次罪行——一九五二年六月十日对巨济岛第七十六号营场战俘的大屠杀。
    巨济岛第七十六号战俘营的我方被俘人员，曾经为了反对美方强迫扣留战俘和虐待战俘，在一九五二年五月七日扣留了美方战俘营长官杜德。刽子手波纳上台以后，就把七十六号营场视为眼中钉，要将这个营场中的朝鲜人民军被俘人员分别强迫迁移到许多小营场，以便进行迫害。波纳事先调集了美军二十五师一个团和空降一八七团共两个团的兵力，另外还有坦克二十二辆，装甲车十辆，将七十六号营场团团围住。六月十日上午七时，波纳出现在七十六号营场外面的一个了望台上，用播音器对战俘说：不服从我的命令就要把你们全部杀死！接着，营场外面美军的六零炮就开始向营场内射击，美军的坦克冲进营场，把帐篷、营房和许多我方被俘人员一起压在履带下面。跟着坦克进来的美军步兵也用刺刀、手榴弹、毒气弹、火焰喷射器向我方被俘人员攻击。赤手空拳的我方被俘人员一批一批地倒下，营场内充满了手榴弹爆炸声，枪声，我方被俘人员的愤怒的喊声，被打伤者的呻吟声。宋龙当时被美军的手榴弹炸伤，倒在地上，摸着地上湿漉漉的，全是我方被俘人员的鲜血。谈到这里，他卷起裤脚管，露出左腿上两块紫黑色的伤疤给记者看，这就是那时被炸伤的痕迹。
    面临着这样惨无人道的屠杀，我方被俘人员忍无可忍，奋起自卫，徒手和野蛮的美军士兵搏斗。波纳后来又投入了三个营的兵力，继续进行了三个钟头的残酷屠杀，才最后将我方被俘人员赶出七十六号营场。遣返归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员李东烱当时走在最后，他离开时，还看到戴着防毒面具的美军士兵在用火焰喷射器屠杀身负重伤、倒在地上不能动弹的我方被俘人员。
    刽子手波纳事后曾经宣布，在这次屠杀中死伤战俘一百七十人。但是据宋龙和李东烱说，实际上我方被俘人员被打死打伤达五百七十多人。
