    Tirelessly Learn
    ——An Open Letter from Soviet Chemist Zelinsky to Soviet Youth During His Lifetime

    Editor's Note: Academician Nikolai Zelinsky, the outstanding Soviet chemist who passed away on July 31st, published an open letter to Soviet youth in the sixth issue of "Soviet Literature" in 1953, entitled "Tirelessly Learn."
    The text is as follows: Young citizens of the motherland!
    You are growing up in a happy era—an era of great struggle and victory, the era of Lenin and Stalin, an era in which the outlines of communism are becoming increasingly clear. You live in a free world, you have a bright future, and all avenues are open to you.
    However, a great era often brings great responsibilities. You must be worthy of this great era.
    I am very old. Now, when I look back on the past, I am very satisfied to see that my life has not been wasted. It contains the most important things that make a person's life meaningful and purposeful: I lived, worked, and fought for my country and people—at the same time, I also made a contribution, albeit a small one, to the priceless treasures of material and knowledge that the people possess and will pass on to future generations.
    In my decades of studying the laws of nature—decades of persistent struggle—I have accumulated some experience little by little from my own work, from books, and from contact and conversation with other people.
    I want to tell you—the future successors—what I think are the most decisive and important things in achieving success in life and in science.
    I know that advice cannot replace personal experience; however, perhaps it can help you achieve success with less effort, enabling you to avoid possible failures and mistakes.
    First of all, strive to be familiar with all kinds of human knowledge. From the resolution of the 19th Party Congress on making the education in our schools comprehensive, I am proud to see that this idea has become the law of the Party.
    Science and technology are developing rapidly in the Soviet Union, faster than at any time in human history. Our control over nature is strengthening day by day, and new natural forces are becoming servants of mankind every day. Only well-educated men and women can control these forces and become the all-round developed people in the coming communist society.
    Do not limit yourselves to the narrow scope of a certain profession you have chosen. Today's doctors and agronomists often find that, in addition to thoroughly understanding their own field of knowledge, mastering the basic knowledge of electricity and astronomy is not only useful but also necessary. A mathematician or physicist who understands botany or geology will be of great help to his work. And mastering social sciences is very important for everyone. It is unimaginable to be a person of our time without understanding social sciences. I don’t need to say more about this.
    When I was young, the only machine that played a role in the lives of the masses was the clock. Even in factories, most of the work was done by hand. Today, thousands of machines—trams, motor vehicles, gas and electrical equipment, telephones, radios, televisions—have become part of our daily lives. The number of machines that each of us comes into contact with is constantly increasing, and the machines themselves are becoming more and more complex and perfect. Soon, much of our daily work will be done by atomic energy. Only well-educated people with multifaceted knowledge can command the army of machines. And how much more must those who create new machines and make new scientific inventions know! Moreover, these discoveries are now often obtained at the boundaries of several sciences that seem to be very far apart.
    Do not confine yourselves to a narrow specialty, you must strive to master all knowledge—this is my first piece of advice.
    Don't think you already know everything, and that you have nothing more to learn. I have been learning all my life, and now I am still learning, and in the future, as long as I have the energy, I will continue to learn. I still remember how enthusiastically I studied the newly published History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) in 1938, when I was already an old man with white hair. From this book, I gained a lot of knowledge that was helpful to all my work.
    Tirelessly learn, never stop learning—this is my second piece of advice.
    Learn the art of collective work. In today's science, only collective efforts can achieve true success. If you work alone, even if you have extraordinary abilities, you cannot make great discoveries in science, while your colleagues will always be amplifiers of your ideas, just as you yourself—as a member of the group—are also amplifiers of other people's ideas.
    Correct collective work first means being able to accept criticism and not being afraid to criticize the mistakes of others, no matter how high their status in the scientific community. Other people's eyes are the easiest to see shortcomings. Criticism can prevent arrogance, complacency, and vanity; it can help you avoid making mistakes.
    Correct collective work means adhering to principles and putting collective interests above personal interests, no matter how important you think these personal interests are. One who has not mastered the art of working in a large group cannot become a scientist.
    The social structure of Soviet life gives you the broadest opportunities to develop all your talents. Make the most of these opportunities. You will find your happiness in learning, working, researching, and selfless service to the people. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 不倦地学习——苏联化学家泽林斯基生前给苏联青年的一封公开信

    不倦地学习
    ——苏联化学家泽林斯基生前给苏联青年的一封公开信
    编者按：七月三十一日逝世的苏联杰出的化学家尼古拉·泽林斯基院士，生前曾在“苏联文学”一九五三年第六期，发表了给苏联青年的一封公开信，题目是“不倦地学习”。
    文如下：祖国的青年公民！
    你们生长在一个幸福的时代——一个伟大的斗争和胜利的时代、列宁和斯大林的时代、共产主义的轮廓日益清晰的时代。你们生活在一个自由世界中，你们有着灿烂的前途，一切大道都在你们面前展开着。
    然而一个伟大的时代常常带来巨大的责任。你们必须无愧于这个伟大的时代。
    我的岁数很大了，现在当我回顾往事的时候，我很满意地看到，我的生命并没有浪费。这里面有着使人的生命变得有意义、有目的的最重要的东西：我生活，工作，为我的国家和人民而奋斗——同时，我也对人民所有的并将传给后代的物质和知识的无价宝藏作出了贡献——虽然是一点点。
    在我研究自然法则的几十年中——坚持不渝地奋斗的几十年中，我从我自己的工作，从书籍、从和其他人们的接触和交谈中一点一滴地积累了一些经验。
    我要把我认为在生活、在科学中取得成就的最有决定意义的、最重要的事情告诉你们——将来的继承者。
    我知道，劝告是不能代替个人经验的；然而也许它可以帮助你们取得成就而少浪费精力，使你们能够避免可能的失败和可能犯的错误。
    首先，要努力熟悉人类的各种知识。从第十九次党代表大会关于使我们学校的教育成为综合性教育的决议中，我很骄傲地看到，这种想法已经成为党的法律。
    科学和技术在苏联迅速地发展着，比人类历史上任何时候都快。我们对自然的控制一天比一天加强，每一天都有新的自然力量成为人类的仆人。只有受过广泛教育的男女才能够控制这些力量，成为将要到来的共产主义社会中的全面发展的人民。
    不要把你们自己限制在你们所选择的某一项职业的狭窄范围中。今天的博士和农业家常常发觉：除了彻底了解他自己的那一门知识外，掌握电学和天文学方面的起码知识，不但是有用的，而且是必要的。数学家或物理学家懂得植物学或地质学就会对他的工作有很大的帮助。而掌握社会科学对每一个人都非常重要，不懂社会科学而作为我们这个时代的人，是不可想像的。这一点，我就不必多说了。
    当我年青的时候，在人民群众的生活中起一点作用的唯一的机械就是钟表。即使在工厂中，大部分工作也是用手做的。而今天，成千种机器——电车、摩托车辆、煤气和电力设备、电话、无线电收音机、电视机——已成为我们日常生活的
    一部分。我们每一个人所接触的机器的数目正在不断地增加，而且机器本身也变得越来越复杂、越来越完美。不久以后，我们的日常工作有许多就要由原子能来做了。只有受过广泛的教育和有多方面知识的人才能指挥机器大军。而那些创造新机器，作出科学新发明的人又必需多知道多少东西啊！而且，现在这些发现常常是在看起来似乎相差得很远的几种科学的分界线上得到的。
    不要把自己关在某一种狭窄的专业中，必须努力掌握全部知识——这是我的第一个劝告。
    不要以为你已经知道了每一样事情，以为你已经没有什么可学了。我学习了一生，现在，我还在学习，而将来，只要我还有精力，我还要学习下去。我还记得，一九三八年，当我已经是一个白发老人的时候，我是用怎样的热情学习新出版的联共（布）党史的，从这本书里，我得到了许多对我一切工作都有帮助的知识。
    不倦地学习，不停止学习——这是我的第二个劝告。
    学习集体工作的艺术。在今天的科学中，只有集体的努力才会有真正的成就。如果你一个人工作，即使你有非凡的能力，你也不能在科学上作出巨大的发现，而你的同事将始终是你的思想的扩音器和放大器，正如你自己——团体中的一员——也是别人的思想的扩音器和放大器一样。
    正确的集体工作首先意味着能够接受批评，不怕批评他人的错误，不管这些人在科学界的地位有多高。别人的眼睛最容易看出缺点来。批评能防止骄傲自大、沾沾自喜、虚荣；它能帮助你避免犯错误。
    正确的集体工作意味着坚持原则，把集体利益放在个人利益之上，不管你认为这种个人利益是多么重要。一个没有掌握在大集团中工作的艺术，就不能成为科学家。
    苏维埃生活的社会结构给你们的最广泛的机会来发展你们的一切才能。尽量地利用这些机会。你们将在学习，工作、研究、和为人民的忘我服务中找到你们的幸福。（新华社）
