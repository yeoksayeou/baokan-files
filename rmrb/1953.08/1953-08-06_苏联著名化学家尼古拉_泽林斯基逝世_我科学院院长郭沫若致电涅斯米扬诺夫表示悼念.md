Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd: The Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Soviet Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Department of Chemistry of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and the State Lomonosov Moscow University jointly issued an obituary for Academician Nikolai Dmitrievich Zelinsky, which reads as follows:

Hero of Socialist Labor, three-time winner of the Stalin Prize, and Professor of the State Lomonosov Moscow University, Academician Nikolai Dmitrievich Zelinsky, passed away on July 31, 1953, at the age of 92.

With the passing of Academician N.D. Zelinsky, the scientific community has lost an authority in organic chemistry, a comprehensive scientist who cultivated several generations of chemists. He wrote more than 250 original scientific works in chemistry and other fields. His works on organic catalysis, synthesis, and other aspects of organic chemistry have always occupied an important position in the world scientific community.

Zelinsky's outstanding inventions have made it possible for industry to convert petroleum hydrocarbons into aromatics. Zelinsky had a profound interest in petroleum, one of our country's important raw materials, and he devoted much energy to studying and investigating petroleum composition and researching methods for studying the properties of Soviet oil and petroleum products. Zelinsky's research on proteins provided a new method for solving the structural problems of these important substances. He invented Russia's first gas mask.

Zelinsky began his scientific activities in 1884, and talented researchers have constantly been educated by him. He created an important scientific school in the Soviet Union. His students work in laboratories, research institutes, factories, and universities all over the Soviet Union.

Zelinsky was a tireless fighter for peace. The Soviet people clearly remember his passionate calls to scientists and young people to defend peace.

The Soviet government highly valued his contributions. In addition to the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, Academician Zelinsky was awarded four Orders of Lenin and two Orders of the Red Banner of Labor.

Zelinsky was very concerned about the education of young people throughout his life. In science, he was very strict with his students and colleagues, adopting a principled attitude while showing compassion and concern.

The Soviet people are justly proud of this outstanding scientist and ardent patriot who dedicated his life to the socialist motherland.

    苏联著名化学家尼古拉·泽林斯基逝世
    我科学院院长郭沫若致电涅斯米扬诺夫表示悼念
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：苏联科学院、苏联文化部、石油工业部、化学工业部、苏联科学院化学部、国立洛蒙诺索夫莫斯科大学联合发出尼古拉·德米特里埃维奇·泽林斯基院士讣闻，文如下：
    社会主义劳动英雄、斯大林奖金三度得奖人、国立洛蒙诺索夫莫斯科大学教授尼古拉·德米特里埃维奇·泽林斯基院士于一九五三年七月三十一日逝世，享年九十二岁。
    由于尼·德·泽林斯基院士的逝世，科学界失去了一个有机化学权威，一个培养了几代的化学家的全面科学家。他在化学等方面写了二百五十多种有独创性的科学著作。他的关于有机触媒作用，综合作用及有机化学其他方面的著作一直在世界科学界占重要的地位。
    泽林斯基的杰出的发明使得工业有可能将石油的碳化氢变香。泽林斯基对我国重要的原料之一——石油感到深刻的兴趣，他贡献了许多精力来研究调查石油成分及研究苏联的石油和石油产品的性质的方法。泽林斯基对于蛋白质的研究提供了一个解决这些重要物质的构成问题的新方法。他发明了俄国的第一个防毒面具。
    泽林斯基是在一八八四年开始他的科学活动的，天才的研究工作者们不断地受到他的教育，他创造了苏联的一个重要的科学学派。他的学生遍布在全苏联各地的实验室、研究所、工厂和高等学校里工作。
    泽林斯基是不知疲倦的和平战士。苏联人民清楚地记得他向科学家、向青年们所发出的维护和平的热情号召。
    苏联政府对他的贡献有很高的评价。除了社会主义劳动英雄的称号外，泽林斯基院士获得了四枚列宁勋章、两枚劳动红旗勋章。
    泽林斯基一生非常关心青年的教育。在科学方面，他对他的学生和同事要求很严格，采取有原则的态度，同时又显示了同情和关切。
    苏联人民以这位把他的一生贡献给社会主义祖国的杰出的科学家和热烈的爱国者而感到正当的骄傲。
