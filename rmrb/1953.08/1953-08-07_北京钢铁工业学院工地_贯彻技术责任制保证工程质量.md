Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Construction Site
Implementing the Technical Responsibility System to Ensure Project Quality

The Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology construction site, directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Construction Engineering Company, is vigorously implementing the technical responsibility system and strengthening technical management. The situation of poor project quality has begun to turn around.

After the establishment of various responsibility systems at this construction site, many problems remained. First, the technical responsibility system had not been thoroughly implemented, resulting in poor project quality. Second, within just over a month of the construction site's commencement, 103 quality problems of varying sizes occurred, leading to serious rework. The views of the site's technical personnel, construction personnel, and workers, prioritizing speed over quality, remained serious. Some workers were still simply focused on "working and earning money." Currently, the scope of the construction site is gradually expanding. If quality issues are not resolved promptly, it will inevitably lead to serious consequences.

In order to thoroughly implement the technical responsibility system and ensure project quality, the Construction Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry first held座谈会for technical personnel, construction personnel, and workers separately to understand some of the reasons for the poor project quality. For example, with the recent implementation of the 1953 labor quotas, some workers were unable to meet the quotas, and they prioritized quantity over quality. Furthermore, the large number of apprentices with low technical skills severely impacted quality. The construction personnel, on the other hand, believed that "the workers' technical skills are low and unable to meet the quotas, and the progress is being pushed so hard that we have no choice." At the same time, construction personnel were not familiar enough with the blueprints, often providing incorrect guidance, which also affected the quality.

In response to this situation, the company decided to ensure quality by starting with the promotion of advanced experiences. First, they cultivated a Geng Youcai team that conscientiously implemented the Su Changyou bricklaying method and used improved mortar-spreading tools. Although the workers in this team had low technical skills, they adopted different construction methods based on the different situations of the inner and outer walls, creating experience in ensuring quality and meeting quotas. On the other hand, the quality of the Wang Yongyi team, which had more technicians but used the old construction methods, was inferior to that of the Geng Youcai team. The company held a comparative exhibition using these two examples. The comparison deeply educated all workers and construction personnel. Many teams at the meeting expressed, "We must learn from the Geng Youcai team." In the past, the Wen Kehai team suffered from poor quality, and everyone abandoned the apprentices to select bricks. At this time, the team leader stated that he would call the apprentices back and diligently promote advanced experience.

Secondly, the company summarized the experiences of several teams with better quality. They believed that to ensure project quality, it was also necessary to establish a quality responsibility system for work teams, clarify the division of labor within the team, define individual responsibilities in conjunction with operating procedures, establish a team handover system with everyone guaranteeing quality and layers of inspection, and establish an inspection at the end of work, mutual inspections, and handover inspections between upper and lower processes. The work team quality responsibility system is the main measure to implement the technical responsibility system among the masses of workers. The company held a general meeting of all workers to introduce typical experiences and widely promoted this responsibility system in various teams. The company also held a performance meeting to introduce various innovations by workers in improving tools or operating methods.

Among the construction personnel, the company organized blueprint learning and held blueprint tests. The blueprint tests were very helpful to the construction personnel, and many construction personnel hoped to take the test several more times. The rework phenomenon caused by unfamiliarity with the blueprints has now begun to be overcome.

The company established a concrete operation test and record system to ensure concrete quality. Concrete construction personnel conducted slump tests twice daily to determine the daily water volume and made records. For each floor's concrete project, test blocks were made and sent to the laboratory to test the strength. In addition to regular inspections, the technical inspection section established a quality inspection network that reached the worker teams. Each team had a quality instructor to grasp the quality situation of the team. The sub-project must be accepted by the technical inspection section before wages could be issued.

In implementing the quality responsibility system, in addition to exerting organizational strength to cooperate in conducting major quality inspections, the company's Party organization, trade union, and Youth League also mobilized the masses to inspect the implementation of their team's and individual's patriotic pledges to ensure quality on time; they launched a red flag competition centered on ensuring quality among the masses, and used blackboards, radio broadcasts, and other means to carry out various publicity activities.

Now the project quality of the construction site has been significantly improved. The bricklaying project has basically achieved horizontal and vertical alignment, smooth wall surfaces, full mortar, and tight joints. The second construction site, type B professor dormitory, learned the lesson of the chaotic steel bars in the first building. In order to ensure that the steel bars in the floor concrete were not trampled and disarranged, a strict handover system was implemented between the concrete workers and the steel bar workers, thus ensuring the correct position of the steel bars. The quality of doors and windows produced by the wood factory has also been greatly improved.

Although the project quality of the Iron and Steel Institute construction site has been significantly improved, it is not yet solid. The company is further studying the technical improvement measures plan, preparing to vigorously implement technical operating procedures, and comprehensively promote advanced experience to further improve project quality.

### 北京钢铁工业学院工地  贯彻技术责任制保证工程质量

    北京钢铁工业学院工地
    贯彻技术责任制保证工程质量
    中央重工业部直属建设工程公司北京钢铁工业学院工地，正在大力贯彻技术责任制，加强技术管理工作。工程质量低劣的情况已经开始扭转。
    这个工地在建立了各种责任制后，问题仍然很多。首先是技术责任制尚未深入贯彻，工程质量低劣。第二工地刚开工一个多月，就发生了大小质量问题一百零三次，返工现象严重。工地的技术人员、施工人员和工人重进度不重质量的观点，仍很严重，有些工人还是单纯“干活赚钱”。目前工地开工的范围已陆续扩大，如果不及时解决质量问题，势必带来严重的后果。
    为了深入贯彻技术责任制，保证工程质量，中央重工业部直属建设工程公司首先分别召开了技术人员、施工人员、工人的座谈会，了解了工程质量不高的一些原因。如刚刚实行一九五三年劳动定额，有些工人还达不到定额，工人急于赶数量，就顾不得质量。加以徒工较多，技术水平不高，使质量受到了严重影响。而施工员则认为“工人技术水平低，达不到定额，进度追的又紧，我们也没有办法”。同时，施工员对图纸不够熟悉，常常指导错误，也影响了质量。
    针对这种情况，公司确定了从推广先进经验入手来保证质量。首先培养了一个认真贯彻苏长有砌砖法与使用改良铺灰工具的耿有才小组。这个小组的工人技术水平虽低，但因为根据内外墙的不同情况，采用了不同的施工方法，创造出保证质量、达到定额的经验。而技工多但采用老一套施工方法的王永义小组的质量，反而不如耿有才小组。公司用这两个典型举行了对比的参观会。通过参观对比深深地教育了全体工人和施工人员。许多小组在会上纷纷表示：“一定要向耿有才小组看齐。”过去，温克海小组因为质量不好，大家都抛开徒工去选砖，这时组长表示要把徒工叫回来，好好推广先进经验。
    其次，公司又总结了几个质量较好的小组的经验。认为要保证工程质量还必须建立班组质量责任制，使组内分工明确，结合操作规程确定个人职责，建立人人保证层层检查的组内交接班制，并建立收工检查、互相检查与上下工序之间的交接检查，班组质量责任制是把技术责任制贯彻到工人群众中去的主要措施。公司召开了全体工人大会，介绍了典型经验，广泛地在各组推广了这种责任制度。公司又召开表演大会，介绍工人改进工具或操作方法的各种创造。
    在施工员当中公司组织了图纸学习，并举行了图纸测验。图纸测验对施工员帮助很大，很多施工员都希望多考几次。现在已开始克服了由于图纸不熟悉而造成的返工现象。
    公司建立了混凝土操作试验与记录制度以保证混凝土质量。混凝土施工员每日进行两次坍落度试验，决定当日水量，并作出记录；每层楼的混凝土工程，都作出试块送试验所检验强度。技术检查科除了进行经常的检查外，又建立了深入到工人小组的质量检查网。各小组都设有质量辅导员掌握本组质量情况。分部工程竣工都必须经技术检查科验收后方准发放工资。
    在贯彻质量责任制中，公司的党组织、工会、青年团除发挥组织力量配合进行质量大检查外，又发动群众按时检查自己小组与个人保证质量的爱国公约执行情况；在群众中开展了以保证质量为中心的红旗竞赛，并利用黑板报、广播等进行各种宣传活动。
    现在工地工程质量已经显著提高。砌砖工程基本上作到了横平竖直、墙面平整、灰浆饱满、接槎严密。二工地乙种教授宿舍接受了第一幢楼钢筋混乱的教训，为了保证楼板混凝土钢筋不被踩乱，在混凝土工与钢筋工之间实行了严格的交接制度，因而保证了钢筋位置的正确。木工厂生产的门窗的质量也大大提高。
    钢铁工业学院工地工程质量虽已有显著提高，但还不够巩固。公司正进一步研究技术改进措施计划，准备大力贯彻技术操作规程，全面推广先进经验，以进一步提高工程质量。（王逊）
