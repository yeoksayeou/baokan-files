    An Unshakable Principle

    Combining political work with economic work is an unshakable principle for the Party organizations in factories and enterprises to effectively realize the Party's guarantee and supervision of production. The most prominent feature of the work of the Party branch of the Sixth Workshop of Jiangling 031 Factory is its adherence to the principle of combining political work with economic work in various movements, and its adoption of a series of measures to adhere to it to the end. The Party branch often pays attention to discovering ideological problems from the struggle for production, and then relies on key members to carry out propaganda work, adheres to the method of individual propaganda and explanation and continuous connections, conducts meticulous political and ideological work, helps relatively backward workers, criticizes ideological problems, and solves production problems. This is starting from production problems, exploring ideological problems, and finally returning from ideological problems to production problems, so that improving ideological level and improving production level are unified. In this way, ideological education and ideological struggle directly become the specific force of the production struggle, and the degree of completion of the production plan becomes the yardstick for measuring the results of the Party's political work.

    Of course, this consistency between political work and production work is directly inseparable from the consistency between the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of every Party member in factories and mines. The Party branch of the factory requires that the political enthusiasm of Communist Party members and workers preparing to join the Communist Party should first be manifested in production. This is completely correct. If a Communist Party member has high political enthusiasm but low production enthusiasm, this political enthusiasm is empty, and this loses a Party member's core role in production. All grassroots Party organizations in enterprises must understand this, otherwise, there will be no talk of the Party's guarantee and supervision of production.

    In order to truly realize the Party's guarantee and supervision of production, it is also necessary to prevent two tendencies: one is the tendency to deviate from politics and use any means to complete the task. For example, forced orders, attacking backward workers and backward workshops, and simply using increased material treatment to lure workers into working overtime. This approach may superficially and occasionally manage to complete the task, but as a result, it dampens workers' production enthusiasm, undermines workers' internal unity, and even leads to the growth of individualism among workers. The other is the tendency to engage in empty talk about politics, deviating from production reality and ideological reality. For example, spending all day busy with meetings, being satisfied with superficial enthusiasm, not understanding the workers' ideological situation and demands, and not solving the various specific problems in workers' production and life. As a result, workers develop a sense of weariness towards this cumbersome political work that does not solve practical problems, which affects the improvement of production.

    It must be understood that doing a good job in production work and doing a good job in ideological and political work in factories and enterprises is an indivisible whole. We cannot imagine creating any miracles in production without political and ideological education, and we cannot imagine achieving any results in ideological education without production practice. The fundamental reason why the Party organizations of some factories cannot well realize the Party's guarantee and supervision of production is that they do not pay attention to preventing and overcoming the above two tendencies, and are not good at combining political work with economic work. This is something we should pay serious attention to and must strive to change.

### 一个不可动摇的原则

    一个不可动摇的原则
    把政治工作和经济工作结合起来，是工厂企业党的组织有效地实现党对生产的保证、监督的一个不可动摇的原则。江零三一工厂第六车间党支部工作最显著的特点，就是在各种运动中坚持了政治工作和经济工作相结合的原则，并采取一系列的措施坚持到底。党的支部经常注意从生产斗争中去发现思想问题，然后依靠骨干分子开展宣传工作，坚持个别宣传解释和连环串连的办法，进行细致的政治思想工作，帮助比较落后的工人，批判思想问题，解决生产问题。这就是从生产问题出发，发掘思想问题，最后又从思想问题归结到生产问题，使提高思想水平和提高生产水平统一起来。这样，思想教育和思想斗争就直接成为生产斗争的具体力量，而生产计划的完成程度也就成了测量党的政治工作成果的标尺。
    当然，这种政治工作和生产工作的一致性，直接和厂矿企业每个党员的政治积极性和生产积极性的一致性分不开的。该厂党支部对于共产党员以及准备参加共产党的工人，要求他们的政治积极性首先应该表现在生产上。这是完全正确的。如果共产党员的政治积极性很高，而生产积极性很低，这种政治积极性就是空洞的，这就失去了一个党员在生产上的核心作用。所有企业中党的基层组织必须明白这一点，否则，那就谈不到党对生产的保证和监督。
    为了真正实现党对生产的保证和监督，还必须防止两种倾向：一种是脱离政治，为完成任务而不择手段的倾向。例如强迫命令，打击落后工人和落后车间，单纯地以提高物质待遇，诱骗工人加班加点等。这种作法，也许在表面上偶然地也能勉强完成任务，但其结果，打击了工人生产情绪，破坏了工人的内部团结，甚至导致工人滋长个人主义的思想。另一种就是空谈政治，脱离生产实际和思想实际的倾向。例如整天忙于开会，满足于表面热闹，不了解工人的思想情况和要求，不解决工人生产和生活中的各种具体问题。其结果造成了工人对这种繁琐而不解决实际问题的政治工作发生厌倦情绪，影响了生产的提高。
    必须了解：在工厂企业中搞好生产工作和搞好思想政治工作是一个不可分割的整体。我们不可能想像脱离政治思想教育而能在生产上创造出什么奇迹，更不能想像脱离生产实际而能在思想教育上获得什么成效。目前有些工厂的党组织所以不能很好地实现党对生产的保证和监督，其根本原因就在于不注意防止克服上述两种倾向，不善于把政治工作和经济工作结合起来。这一点值得我们严重注意，必须努力加以改变。
