Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest dispatch: The Third World Youth Congress closed on July 30th. The Congress unanimously approved the decision of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) Council to admit several new organizations into the Federation. These organizations have a total of eight million members, bringing the Federation's total membership to 83 million youth from 90 countries. The Congress adopted the amendments to the WFDY Charter proposed by WFDY Secretary-General Jacques Denis, re-elected the new WFDY Council and the Central Financial Control Committee, with Bruno Bernini of Italy elected as Chairman and Jacques Denis of France re-elected as Secretary-General. The Congress unanimously adopted a resolution on the report made by WFDY Secretary-General Jacques Denis to the Congress on "The activities of the WFDY since the Second World Youth Congress and the tasks of youth in the struggle for peace and their rights," and passed a letter to the Youth of the World. The Congress concluded victoriously after a closing speech by Denis.

At the morning session on the 30th, the Congress heard the report of the Credentials Committee. The report stated that a total of 1,515 delegates from 106 countries participated in the Third World Youth Congress, including 856 delegates, 398 observers, and 261 guests. More than 30 countries participated in this Congress compared to the previous one. The delegates attending the Congress represented youth with different political views and from different social strata. Among them, workers and apprentices accounted for 24 percent of the delegates, students accounted for 22 percent, clerks accounted for 12 percent, and farmers, engineers and technicians, and teachers each accounted for 5 percent. Also participating in the Congress were artisans, journalists, scientists, doctors, representatives of religious organizations, members of parliament and city councils, musicians, architects, painters, and actors, etc. There were 200 female delegates participating in the Congress, and the average age of the delegates was 24 years old.

The resolution passed by the Congress on Denis' report stated: The Congress noted with great satisfaction the growing strength and achievements of the international youth movement for peace and their rights. The main task of the WFDY is to organize the broadest joint action to defend the rights of youth and strive for the realization of youth's aspirations. The Congress pointed out that the difficult lives of young people in many countries are caused by the policies of preparing for another world war, rearmament, and enslaving people. The Congress called on all youth organizations to work together to ensure that the needs of the younger generation are met and to safeguard their democratic rights. The resolution called on young men and women to work hard to urge their countries to take measures to enable young people to receive universal vocational education, guarantee young people's rights to work and leisure, guarantee equal pay for equal work, and guarantee opportunities to participate in social life.

The resolution stated: The Congress advocates the widest possible cultural exchange between young people of all countries, and calls on all youth organizations to actively support the efforts of people of all countries to ease international tensions. The resolution stated: It is the most noble task of young people to participate with the greatest strength in the movement initiated by the World Peace Council to strive for negotiation, for a peaceful settlement of disputes, and for the cessation of existing wars and all acts of aggression that violate national independence. The resolution finally emphasized the importance of strengthening the unity of youth in the struggle.

The letter to the Youth of the World adopted by the Congress pointed out that the representatives participating in the Third World Youth Congress, despite having different views and beliefs and belonging to various youth organizations, shared common desires and interests. We hope that the youth of all countries and all races will not be shrouded in the clouds of worry and anxiety about tomorrow. We hope that everyone has a job and a profession, everyone can study and rest, everyone has the real possibility of starting a family and living a peaceful and happy life, and everyone has the right to participate in social and political life. To realize these hopes, young people must unite. The peaceful and friendly alliance of young people of all countries and all strata is a powerful force in the struggle to realize the demands and aspirations of the younger generation. War, the arms race, and the phenomenon of certain countries being subordinate to other countries hinder the realization of the rights and aspirations of young people.

The letter to the Youth of the World finally called on the youth of all countries to actively participate in the international consultation movement initiated by the World Peace Council, and emphasized that the realization of the Korean armistice proves that it is possible to resolve all international disputes through negotiation. Let us unite and dedicate our youthful energy to the noble cause of peace.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: At the morning session of the World Youth Congress on the 27th, Hu Yaobang, head of the Chinese youth delegation, was the first to speak. In his speech, Hu Yaobang first extended congratulations to the Congress on behalf of the Chinese youth delegation, paid tribute to the youth of all countries and the Romanian people and youth, and expressed on behalf of the Chinese youth delegation his complete agreement with the report of WFDY Secretary-General Denis. He then said that Chinese youth warmly applauded the brilliant achievements of the great Soviet Union and the youth of all people's democratic countries in the cause of peaceful construction. Chinese youth will do everything possible to develop the profound friendship with Soviet youth. He also paid tribute to the heroic Korean and Vietnamese youth, and on behalf of Chinese youth expressed sympathy and concern for the struggles of youth in colonial and oppressed countries and the struggles of youth in capitalist countries.

Hu Yaobang spoke about the great achievements made by Chinese youth in peaceful labor under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Young workers actively participated in patriotic production competitions, and tens of thousands of labor models emerged. He went on to say that with the restoration and development of production, the material and cultural lives of the Chinese people and youth have gradually improved. Chinese youth have obtained extensive rights to participate in national political and social activities, and Chinese youth organizations have been further developed. The development and achievements of the Chinese youth movement are inseparable from our superior system and inseparable from the care of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. The feelings of loving the motherland and loving the leader often inspire us to move forward.

Hu Yaobang said: The Chinese people and youth abhor war. What we want is how to build our lovely motherland and a better life. We have always advocated a peaceful solution to the Korean question, and have made unremitting efforts to achieve this goal. After two years and seventeen days of armistice negotiations, the Korean Armistice Agreement was finally signed. This is a major event that hundreds of millions of people around the world eagerly hope for, and it is also the result of the joint efforts of peace-loving people.

At this time, an unforgettable and exciting scene appeared in the venue. The entire audience stood up, and the hall was filled with stormy applause and cheers. Then, the delegates flocked to the seats of the Chinese and Korean delegations, throwing flowers at them, hugging them, and kissing them. Finally, the youth ran to the seats of the Soviet delegation, shouting "Long live the Soviet Union," expressing the infinite gratitude and love of the youth of all countries for the great fortress of world peace. The carnival at the Congress lasted for an hour.

Then, Hu Yaobang continued his speech. He said that we must continue to be vigilant, prevent possible obstruction and sabotage by the enemies of peace, and strive for the full realization of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The agreement finally reached in the Korean armistice negotiations shows that it is possible to resolve all existing international disputes through negotiation. Chinese youth warmly support the World Peace Council's Budapest Conference's proposal to resolve all international disputes immediately through consultation.

He pointed out that the recent international situation shows that the influence of the spirit of consultation is expanding day by day, but a small number of war forces are still trying to create international tensions. Therefore, the further development of the world people's peace movement is of even greater significance. Strengthening the unity of peace-loving youth around the world and striving to bring millions of good young people who are still outside the peace movement into the ranks of defending peace is the most important issue in our work today. Chinese youth expressed to the Congress their willingness to establish friendly ties with peace-loving youth organizations of all countries and strengthen cooperation and unity in the cause of defending peace.

Hu Yaobang said that only by fully respecting national sovereignty can the peaceful coexistence of all countries in the world be guaranteed. The struggle of youth in colonial and dependent countries to improve their situation and to strive for national independence is closely related to the goals of the peace movement.

Hu Yaobang concluded by saying: Chinese youth will always be loyal to the cause of unity of the WFDY. We will work harder to build our motherland. We will forge close friendships with peace-loving youth all over the world, and under the banner of the WFDY, we will bravely advance towards peace, friendship, and the bright future of youth.

    世界青年代表大会闭幕
    胡耀邦报告了中国青年运动的发展和成就
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：第三届世界青年代表大会已在七月三十日闭幕。大会一致通过世界民主青年联盟理事会关于批准一些新组织加入联盟的决定，这些组织共拥有八百万会员，这使得联盟现在已团结了九十个国家的八千三百万青年。大会通过了世界民主青年联盟总书记雅克·德尼提出的对联盟盟章的修正案，并改选了联盟的新理事会和中央管理财务委员会，意大利的布伦诺·柏尼尼当选为联盟主席，法国的雅克·德尼连任总书记。大会已一致就世界民主青联总书记雅克·德尼向大会所作的“世界民主青年联盟自第二届世界青年代表大会以来的活动以及青年在争取和平与他们的权利的斗争中的任务”的报告通过决议，并通过了告世界青年书。大会最后由德尼致闭幕词后宣告胜利闭幕。
    在三十日的上午会议上，大会听取了资格审查委员会的报告。报告说：共有一百零六个国家的一千五百一十五名代表参加了第三届世界青年代表大会，其中有八百五十六名代表、三百九十八名观察员和二百六十一名来宾。参加这届大会的国家比上届多了三十多个。参加大会的代表，代表着有不同政治见解和不同阶层的青年。他们中间工人与学徒占代表人数的百分之二十四、学生占百分之二十二、职员占百分之十二、农民、工程师和技术人员、教员各占百分之五，参加大会的还有手工业者、记者、科学家、医生、各宗教团体代表、议会和市议会议员、音乐家、建筑师、画家和演员等。参加大会的有两百个女代表，参加大会的代表的平均年龄是二十四岁。
    大会就德尼的报告通过的决议说：大会极为满意地指出国际青年争取和平与他们的权利的运动的日益壮大和它的成就。世界民主青联的主要任务，就是组织最广泛的联合行动，来保卫青年权利，并争取青年希望的实现。大会指出许多国家内青年的困苦生活是由准备另一次世界大战、重整军备与奴役人民的政策造成的，大会号召所有青年组织共同努力来争取青年一代的需要得到满足，并维护他们的民主权利。决议要求青年男女努力敦促自己的国家采取措施，使青年能受到普遍的职业教育、保证青年的工作与休假的权利、保证同工同酬、保证有参加社会生活的机会。
    决议说：大会主张各国青年之间进行最广泛的文化交流，并要求所有青年组织积极支持各国人民争取缓和国际紧张局势的努力。决议说：以最大力量来参加世界和平理事会发起的争取协商、争取和平解决分歧、争取停止现有战争以及一切侵犯民族独立的侵略行动的运动，是青年们最崇高的任务。决议最后着重指出了加强青年在斗争中团结的重要性。
    大会通过的告世界青年书指出，参加第三届世界青年代表大会的代表尽管具有不同的观点和信仰，属于各种各样的青年组织，然而他们有着共同的愿望和利益。我们希望，所有国家，所有种族的青年时代，不要笼罩着对明天的忧虑和不安的乌云。我们希望，每个人都有工作和职业，每个人都能读书和休息，每个人都有成立一个家庭、过和平幸福生活的真正可能性，每个人都有参加社会和政治生活的权利。要实现这些希望，青年必须团结起来。所有国家、所有阶层青年的和平友好联盟，是为实现年青一代的要求和愿望而斗争的一支强大力量。战争、扩军运动和某些国家附属于其他国家的现象，阻挠着青年权利与愿望的实现。
    告世界青年书最后号召各国青年积极参加世界和平理事会发起的争取国际协商运动，并且强调说，朝鲜停战的实现，证明用协商办法来解决一切国际争端问题是可能的，让我们团结起来吧，把我们青年的精力献给崇高的和平事业。
    据新华社讯：在世界青年代表大会二十七日上午会议上，中国青年代表团团长胡耀邦第一个发言。胡耀邦在发言中首先代表中国青年代表团向大会致贺，向各国青年和罗马尼亚人民和青年致敬，并代表中国青年代表团表示完全同意世界民主青年联盟总书记德尼的报告。他接着说，中国青年热烈欢呼伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家的青年在和平建设事业中的辉煌成就。中国青年将尽一切力量，来发展与苏联青年间的深厚友谊。他并且向英勇的朝鲜和越南青年致敬，并代表中国青年对殖民地和被压迫国家的青年的斗争及资本主义各国青年的斗争表示同情和关怀。
    胡耀邦谈到中国青年在中国共产党和毛主席领导下在和平劳动中所取得的伟大成就。青年工人们积极参加爱国主义生产竞赛，涌现出了成万名的劳动模范。他接着说，随着生产的恢复和发展，中国人民和青年的物质和文化生活也逐步提高。中国青年已经得到参加国家政治和社会活动的广泛权利，中国的青年组织已经得到更大的发展。中国青年运动的发展和成就，是和我们优越的制度分不开的，是和中国共产党和毛泽东主席的关怀分不开的。热爱祖国和热爱领袖的心情，经常鼓舞着我们前进。
    胡耀邦说：中国人民和青年是厌恶战争的。我们所想的是如何建设自己可爱的祖国和更加美好的生活。我们一向主张和平解决朝鲜问题，并为了这个目标的实现进行了坚持不懈的努力。经过两年零十七天的停战谈判，朝鲜停战协定终于签字了。这是全世界亿万人民殷切希望的大事，也是爱好和平的人们共同努力的结果。
    这时，会场上出现了令人难忘的激动场面。全场起立，暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声震动全场。接着，代表们纷纷涌向中国代表团和朝鲜代表团的座位，向他们抛掷鲜花，拥抱他们，并与他们接吻。最后，青年们跑到苏联代表团的座位，高呼“苏联万岁”，表达了各国青年对世界和平伟大堡垒的无限感激和热爱。大会这样的狂欢达一个小时之久。
    然后，胡耀邦继续发言。他说，我们还要继续提高警惕，防止和平敌人可能的阻挠和破坏，为朝鲜停战协定的完全实现而奋斗。朝鲜停战谈判终于获得协议说明了：用协商的方式来解决一切现存的国际争端是可能的。中国青年热烈拥护世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议要求立即经过协商来解决一切国际争端的主张。
    他指出，最近的国际形势表明协商精神的影响正在日益扩大，但是少数战争势力还在企图制造国际紧张局势，因此世界人民和平运动的进一步发展有着更加重大的意义。加强全世界爱好和平的青年的团结，争取那些至今还在和平运动以外的千百万善良青年参加到保卫和平的行列中来，是我们今天工作中最重要的问题。中国青年向大会表示，愿与各国爱好和平的青年组织建立友谊的联系，并加强在保卫和平事业中的合作与团结。
    胡耀邦说，只有充分尊重民族主权才能够保证世界各国和平共处。殖民地与附属国青年争取改善处境和争取民族独立的斗争，是与和平运动的目标有着密切关系的。
    胡耀邦最后说：中国青年永远忠实于世界民主青年的团结事业。我们将更加努力建设祖国。我们将与全世界爱好和平的青年结成紧密的友谊，在世界民主青联的旗帜下，向和平友谊和青年的美好将来奋勇前进。
