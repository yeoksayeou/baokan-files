Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: Washington news: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' plan, announced on the 1st, to keep American troops stationed in South Korea for forced labor, has sparked a chorus of condemnation in the U.S. Congress.

    According to the official United States Information Service, a State Department spokesman announced that Dulles, in a conversation on the 1st with the ambassadors of the fifteen "allied nations" participating in the Korean War, explained his proposed plan, which stipulates that "American troops will remain in (South) Korea to engage in road construction, bridge building, and the construction of schools and hospitals." This American plan, which attempts to continue stationing its troops in South Korea in another way, Dulles said, has "received the enthusiastic support of President Eisenhower."

    After Dulles' plan was announced, it was immediately met with fierce attacks from many members of the U.S. Congress. Senator Saltonstall, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in the Senate on the 3rd that it was "absurd" for Dulles to have combat soldiers working in Korea, wielding shovels and pushing carts. Senator Kefauver criticized Dulles, saying, "We will never allow the use of American troops for forced labor in foreign countries."

    Representative H.R. Gross cabled Eisenhower on the 4th, demanding the dismissal of Dulles as Secretary of State. In the telegram, Gross said that Dulles "has clearly shown that he is not an asset but a liability," and he suggested that Eisenhower "immediately recall Dulles from Korea before he can cause further trouble, and upon his return, demand his resignation."

    According to Reuters, "The White House was apparently shocked by this uproar of public opinion" and hurriedly issued a statement on the evening of the 3rd, saying that President Eisenhower "has no intention whatsoever of using American combat troops in Korea as a labor army." On the 4th, the U.S. State Department also issued a statement in quick succession, futilely denying this plan of Dulles, which its spokesman had publicly announced just the day before.

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 5th dispatch: Indian and Pakistani newspapers have criticized Dulles' remarks at a press conference on July 28th. The "Times of India" published an editorial on August 5th, saying: "If the opinions expressed by Dulles at the press conference really represent the attitude of the American government, then it would be better to consider the post-Korean armistice political conference as a tragically failed effort and write it off." The editorial asked: "If this is really the case, then what is the point of having a political conference? It is enough to present a series of demands to China and North Korea and ask them to answer 'yes' or 'no'." The editorial said that when Dulles put forward these demands, "he even forgot that at the time of the armistice, the Korean War was being fought near the 38th parallel; and the military results of the thirty-seven months of war cannot support the policy he described." The editorial said: "Now it seems that it is Dulles, rather than Syngman Rhee, who wants to doom the political conference to failure."

    The "Pakistan Times" published an editorial on July 31st, saying, "Dulles has indicated to Syngman Rhee that he is willing to negotiate the so-called U.S.-South Korea security treaty when he visits South Korea in the near future. This not only violates the spirit of the Korean armistice, but also seriously endangers the post-armistice political conference that has not yet convened."

    杜勒斯要使美军留驻南朝鲜从事强迫劳役的计划
    遭到美国国会许多议员激烈攻击
    印度和巴基斯坦报纸斥责杜勒斯破坏政治会议的企图 【新华社六日讯】华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯一日宣布的使美国军队留驻南朝鲜从事强迫劳役的计划，在美国国会中引起一片咒骂声。
    据官方的美国新闻处报道，国务院发言人宣布：杜勒斯曾在一日和参加朝鲜战争的十五个“盟国”的大使谈话中说明他所拟订的这个计划，规定“将美国军队留驻（南）朝鲜从事筑路、造桥、建筑学校和医院”。美国这个企图用另一种方式把它的军队继续留在南朝鲜的计划，据杜勒斯表示，已“受到艾森豪威尔总统的热烈支持”。
    杜勒斯的计划宣布之后，立即遭到美国国会许多议员的激烈攻击。参议院军事委员会主席沙顿斯脱尔三日在参议院发言说：杜勒斯要把作战的士兵放在朝鲜做工，执铲推车，是“荒谬的”。参议员克弗维尔抨击杜勒斯说：“我们决不容许使用美国军队在外国来作强迫劳役。”
    众议员赫·鲁·格罗斯在四日致电艾森豪威尔，要求撤消杜勒斯的国务卿职务。格罗斯在电报里说：杜勒斯“已清楚地表现他不是一个人才而是一个累赘”，他建议艾森豪威尔“在杜勒斯可能进一步制造麻烦之前立即把他从朝鲜召回来，在他回来后即行要求他辞职”。
    据路透社报道，“白宫显然为这种哗然的舆论所震惊”，慌忙在三日晚间发表声明说：艾森豪威尔总统“丝毫无意利用美国作战部队在朝鲜充当劳动大军”。四日，美国国务院也紧接着发表声明，徒然地抵赖它的发言人就在前一天所公开宣布的杜勒斯的这一计划。
    【新华社新德里五日电】印度和巴基斯坦报纸斥责杜勒斯七月二十八日在记者招待会上的谈话。“印度时报”八月五日发表社论说：“如果杜勒斯在记者招待会上发表的意见真的代表美国政府的态度的话，那倒不如把朝鲜停战后的政治会议看作已经悲惨失败而予一笔勾销。”社论问道：“如果真的这样，那么还要政治会议干什么？只要对中国和北朝鲜提出一连串要求，请他们回答一声‘可以’或‘不行’就够了。”社论说，杜勒斯在提出这些要求时，“他竟然忘记了在停战时，朝鲜战争是在三八线附近进行；而三十七个月的战争的军事结果也并不能支持他所说明的政策。”社论说：“现在看来，要置政治会议于失败之地的，与其说是李承晚，倒不如说是杜勒斯。”
    “巴基斯坦时报”七月三十一日发表社论说，“杜勒斯已经向李承晚表示，他愿意在不久以后访问南朝鲜时谈判所谓美国——南朝鲜安全条约。这不仅违反朝鲜停战的精神，而且也严重危及还没有召开的停战后的政治会议。”
