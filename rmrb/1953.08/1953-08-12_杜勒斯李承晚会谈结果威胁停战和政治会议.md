Xinhua News Agency, August 11th:

    The results of the four-day talks between Dulles and Rhee Syngman culminated in the signing of a "U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty Draft" in Seoul on the 8th, along with a joint statement.
    The outcome of the Dulles-Rhee Syngman talks seriously threatens the Korean armistice and the future political conference.
    The "U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" is, in essence, a treaty preparing for war, an aggressive treaty. The draft treaty stipulates that if either signatory believes that the so-called "political independence or security" of one party is threatened by a so-called "external armed attack," they will consult together. "Each party recognizes that an attack in the Pacific area on either party to the treaty, whether an attack on the territories currently under their respective jurisdiction or on territories later recognized by one party to the treaty as being under the lawful jurisdiction of the other party, endangers its own peace and security, and therefore declares that it will act in accordance with its constitutional processes to deal with the common danger." "The Republic of Korea grants the United States of America the right, which the United States of America accepts, to station its land, sea, and air forces in and around the territory of the Republic of Korea as mutually agreed upon."
    This means that, according to this treaty, either the United States or Rhee Syngman can launch a war on the pretext of "suffering an attack" and wage war together. At the same time, the United States, having obtained the right to station troops in South Korea indefinitely, can turn South Korea into a U.S. military base and colony.
    The joint statement by Dulles and Rhee Syngman reveals the major conspiracy hidden within the "U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" concocted by the United States. The joint statement said: "From now until the day the Mutual Defense Treaty is expected to be implemented and take effect, our forces in Korea will be under the command of the United Nations Command." The statement also said, "Our two governments will promptly negotiate and conclude an agreement to determine the status of U.S. forces that may be maintained in Korea after the Mutual Defense Treaty is implemented and takes effect."
    This actually means that after the Mutual Defense Treaty is implemented and takes effect, the U.S. military and the Rhee Syngman puppet army will not be under the jurisdiction of the so-called "United Nations Command," and they will not be bound by the Korean Armistice Agreement. In this way, the U.S. military can continue to stay in Korea under the Mutual Defense Treaty, and the U.S. military and the Rhee Syngman puppet army can take free action.
    The joint statement also reveals another conspiracy. The statement indicates that the United States is prepared to overturn the guarantees it made before the signing of the armistice agreement. The statement said that if, from now until the Mutual Defense Treaty is implemented and takes effect, the Korean-Chinese side "were to violate the armistice agreement and launch an unwarranted armed attack on South Korea, then the United Nations forces, including the Korean forces, will immediately and automatically resume action." The facts of the fifteen days since the signing of the armistice agreement prove that the Rhee Syngman puppet army and the U.S. military are constantly creating incidents that violate the armistice agreement, while the Korean-Chinese side strictly abides by all the provisions of the armistice agreement. The Dulles-Rhee Syngman agreement shows that if the Rhee Syngman puppet army expands its actions in violation of the armistice agreement and is thus met with a counterattack from the Korean-Chinese side, the United States will falsely accuse the Korean-Chinese side of "launching an unwarranted armed attack" and drag its "allies" into resuming the war. This agreement also shows that after the U.S.-Rhee Syngman Mutual Defense Treaty takes effect, if Rhee Syngman provokes a war, the United States will provide Rhee Syngman with military assistance.
    All of this seriously threatens the Korean armistice. Dulles's visit to Korea does not help peace, but rather threatens to undermine the Korean armistice. He has arranged everything needed to restart the war, and he has given Rhee Syngman the greatest assurance needed to "automatically resume action."
    The Dulles-Rhee Syngman meeting also threatens the political conference to be held within three months after the armistice. The joint statement by Dulles and Rhee Syngman also shows that the United States and Rhee Syngman are conspiring to manipulate the political conference. The joint statement said, "At this conference, the U.S. delegation will work with the Korean delegation and the delegations of other countries on the Allied side to seek the peaceful unification of Korea with its historical boundaries." The statement also said that if the goal of unifying Korea under Rhee Syngman's rule cannot be achieved ninety days after the political conference has begun, then they will jointly withdraw from the political conference. Then, they will further consult on how to "unify Korea." The statement also said that Rhee Syngman has agreed "not to take unilateral action to unify Korea by military means during the agreed political conference period." According to Dulles's later explanation at a press conference, the so-called "agreed political conference period" refers to the ninety-day period.
    This means that the United States and Rhee Syngman have unilaterally set a time limit for the political conference and are attempting to force other countries participating in the political conference to accept their unreasonable demands. If other countries still do not accept the unreasonable demands of the U.S. and Rhee Syngman ninety days after the political conference has begun, then the U.S. and Rhee Syngman will withdraw from the political conference, and Rhee Syngman can take unilateral action to unify Korea by military means. Dulles clearly knows that one of the important agenda items of the political conference is the withdrawal of all foreign troops in Korea. This is stipulated in the armistice agreement. He hurriedly rushed to Seoul less than a few days after the armistice agreement took effect and signed the "Mutual Defense Treaty" with Rhee Syngman, obtaining the right for the United States to station troops in Korea. This shows that the United States intends to undermine the armistice agreement, making the political conference's discussion of the withdrawal of foreign troops meaningless. According to the plans of the United States and Rhee Syngman, the political conference will be held in October and will be declared over in January of next year. The U.S. Senate will also approve the U.S.-Rhee Syngman Mutual Defense Treaty in January of next year. At that time, Rhee Syngman can launch a war, and the U.S. military will withdraw from the United Nations forces and continue to be stationed in Korea under the Mutual Defense Treaty and provide Rhee Syngman with assistance. This is clearly an extremely blatant encouragement of Rhee Syngman's conspiracy to undermine the armistice.
    Dulles's encouragement to Rhee Syngman does not stop there. The joint statement announced that the United States will provide Rhee Syngman with one billion dollars in economic aid, not including the two hundred million dollars already allocated to Rhee Syngman. The statement also said that Dulles and Rhee Syngman "have preliminarily exchanged views on various issues related to maintaining and developing the ROK's sea, land, and air forces."
    The Dulles-Rhee Syngman talks show that the U.S. government is not reconciled to the failure of its aggressive policy and is determined to manipulate the political conference, maintain its troops in South Korea, obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and strive to maintain the tense situation in Korea and the Far East in order to continue to pursue its aggressive policy.
    The Korean armistice is only fifteen days old, and the armistice agreement has not been fully implemented, but the U.S. side has cast heavy shadows on the prospects for the armistice and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The Korean armistice is the result of the persistent struggle of peace-loving people all over the world. In order to consolidate the armistice and to further achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the world must use greater force to defeat Dulles's conspiracy.

    杜勒斯李承晚会谈结果威胁停战和政治会议
    【新华社十一日讯】杜勒斯和李承晚经过了四天的会谈之后，八日在汉城签署了“美韩共同防御条约草案”，并发表了一个联合声明。
    杜勒斯和李承晚会谈的结果，严重地威胁着朝鲜停战和将来举行的政治会议。
    “美韩共同防御条约”实质上是准备战争的条约，是侵略性的条约。这个条约草案中规定：缔约国双方，在任何一方认为有一方的所谓“政治独立或安全”受到所谓“外来的武装进攻的威胁”时，就将共同磋商；“每一方都承认，在太平洋地区对缔约的任一方的进攻，无论是对目前各自管辖下的领土的进攻，或是对以后为缔约的一方承认为另一方合法管辖的领土的进攻，都是危及了它自己的和平与安全，因此声明，它将按照它的宪法程序采取行动以对付共同的危险”；“大韩民国给予美利坚合众国在双方共同商定的大韩民国领土以内及其周围布置美国陆海空军部队的权利，同时美利坚合众国加以接受”。
    这就是说，根据这个条约，美国和李承晚任何一方都可以藉口“遭受进攻”而发动战争并一起进行战争。同时，美国由于获得了在南朝鲜无限期驻兵的权利，就可以把南朝鲜变为美国的军事基地和殖民地。
    杜勒斯和李承晚的联合声明，透露了美国一手炮制的“美韩共同防御条约”中所蕴藏的重大阴谋。联合声明说：“从现在到共同防御条约可望实施和生效的日子这期间，我们在朝鲜的军队将受联合国军司令部指挥”。声明又说，“我们两国政府将迅速谈判订立协定，以确定美国在共同防御条约实施与生效后可能在朝鲜维持的驻军的地位。”
    这实际上就是说，在共同防御条约实施并生效以后，美国军队和李伪军将不受所谓“联合国军司令部”的管辖，它们将不受朝鲜停战协定的约束，这样，美国军队就可以根据共同防御条约而继续留驻朝鲜，同时，美国军队和李伪军可以采取自由行动。
    联合声明中还透露了另一个阴谋。声明表示，美国准备推翻他们在停战协定签字前所作的保证。声明说，如果在从现在到共同防御条约实施和生效期间，朝中方面“竟然违反停战协定，向韩国发动无端的武装进攻的话，那末，联合国军，包括韩军在内，将立即，自动地再次行动起来”。停战协定签订以后十五天中的事实证明：李伪军和美军正在不断制造违反停战协定的事件，而朝中方面则严格遵守停战协定的一切条款。杜勒斯和李承晚的协议表明：如果李伪军扩大它们的违反停战协定的行动，因而遭到朝中方面的反击的话，美国就要诬蔑是朝中方面“发动无端的武装进攻”而拖着它的“盟国”一起恢复战争。这个协议也表明：在美李共同防御条约生效以后，如果李承晚挑起战争，美国将给予李承晚以军事援助。
    所有这些，都严重地威胁朝鲜停战。杜勒斯到朝鲜去，不但无助于和平，而且会使朝鲜停战有被破坏的危险。他已安排好了为重新发动战争所需要的一切，他给了李承晚“自动地再次行动起来”所需要的最大保证。
    杜勒斯和李承晚的会议，同时也威胁着停战后三个月内举行的政治会议。杜勒斯和李承晚的联合声明还表明：美国和李承晚预谋操纵政治会议。联合声明说，“在这个会议上，美国代表团将协同韩国代表团及联军方面的其他国家代表团谋求实现具有历史版图的朝鲜的和平的统一”。声明还说，如果在政治会议已经开了九十天之后，把朝鲜统一在李承晚的统治下的目标无法达到的话，那末，它们将共同退出政治会议。然后，它们将进一步磋商如何“统一朝鲜”的问题。声明还说，李承晚已经同意，“在已协议的政治会议期间不采取片面行动，用军事手段来统一朝鲜”。据杜勒斯后来在记者招待会上说明，所谓“已协议的政治会议期间”就是指九十天内。
    这就是说，美国和李承晚已片面地给政治会议规定了时限，并且企图强迫参加政治会议的其他国家接受它们的无理主张。如果其他国家在政治会议开了九十天之后仍不接受美李的无理主张，那末，美李就要退出政治会议，李承晚就可以采取片面的行动，用军事手段来统一朝鲜。杜勒斯明明知道政治会议的重要议程之一是撤退在朝鲜的一切外国军队。这是停战协定所规定的。他在停战协定生效不到几天就急忙赶到汉城，和李承晚签订了“共同防御条约”，取得了美国在朝鲜驻兵权。这就表明美国蓄意破坏停战协定，使政治会议讨论撤退外国军队问题变成毫无意义。按照美国和李承晚的打算，政治会议将在十月间举行，在明年一月间宣告结束。而美国参议院也将在明年一月间批准美李共同防御条约。那时候，李承晚可以发动战争，而美国军队将要退出联合国军，根据共同防御条约继续驻在朝鲜，并且给予李承晚以援助。这显然是对于李承晚的破坏停战阴谋的一种极端露骨的鼓励。
    杜勒斯对李承晚的鼓励还不止这些。联合声明宣布，美国将给予李承晚十亿美元经济援助，已经拨给李承晚的二亿美元还不算在内。声明还说，杜勒斯和李承晚“已经就和维持与发展韩国的海、陆、空军有关的各种问题初步地交换了意见”。
    杜勒斯和李承晚的会谈表明，美国政府并不甘心其侵略政策的失败，决心要操纵政治会议，保持在南朝鲜的驻军，阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，竭力保持朝鲜和远东局势的紧张状态、以便继续推行其侵略政策。
    朝鲜停战才不过十五天，停战协定还没有完全实现，而美国方面已为停战和朝鲜问题和平解决的前途投下重重暗影了。朝鲜停战是全世界爱好和平人民坚持奋斗的成果。为了巩固停战，为了进一步取得朝鲜问题的和平解决，全世界必须用更大的力量来击败杜勒斯的阴谋。
