(Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 6th) Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army naval defense units completely recovered all large and small coastal islands that had been occupied by the enemy after being controlled by our side on June 24, 1950, ten days after the Korean Armistice Agreement took effect—that is, from 22:00 on August 6. According to the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, all islands located north and west of the sea boundary between Hwanghae Province and Gyeonggi Province in western Korea, with the exception of the Baengnyeong Island, Daecheong Island, Socheong Island, Yeonpyeong Island, and Udo island groups, which remain under the military control of the enemy, have been placed under the military control of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　Among the islands recovered and controlled by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, there are more than fifty larger ones. In the West Sea, there are more than forty large and small islands, including Daedaedo and Sidaedo located off the coast of the Cheolsan Peninsula, Chodo, Seokdo, Sangchwirodo, and Hachwirodo located outside the mouth of the Daedong River, and Mahahapdo, Girindo, Changrindo, Daesoyapdo, and Yongmaedo located off the coast of the Ongjin Peninsula. In the East Sea, there are more than ten large and small islands, including Nandao located off the coast of Tongcheon in eastern Korea, Yangdo located southeast of Kilju, and Lido, Sindo, and Ungdo located outside Wonsan Port. The above islands are more than ten kilometers away from the coast at their farthest, and less than one kilometer at their closest.

　　During the past Korean war against aggression, the naval defense forces of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fought many victorious battles with the enemy on the sea and on the islands, and recovered many large and small islands. For example, in the sea off the Cheolsan Peninsula in western Korea, except for a few islands such as Daedaedo and Sidaedo, other islands such as Daehwado, Gadado, Sinmido, and Tando, about fifty large and small islands, had been recovered by the Korean-Chinese People's Armies before the ceasefire on the entire Korean front.

    按照朝鲜停战协定的规定
    朝中部队已收回曾被敌方侵占的沿海岛屿
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军海防部队，已于朝鲜停战协定生效后十天——即八月六日二十二时起，全部收回在一九五零年六月二十四日为我方所控制以后曾被敌方侵占的我方沿海的大小岛屿。按照朝鲜停战协定的规定，位于朝鲜西部黄海道和京畿道道界以北及以西的一切岛屿，除白翎岛、大青岛、小青岛、延坪岛及隅岛诸岛群留置敌方的军事控制之下以外，其余已全部置于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的军事控制之下。
    上述由朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军收回和控制的岛屿，其中较大者约有五十多个。在西海面，有位于铁山半岛海面的大小腊岛，位于大同江口外的椒岛、席岛、上下吹螺岛和位于瓮津半岛海面的麻哈蛤岛、麒麟岛、昌麟岛、大小睡鸭岛、龙媒岛等四十多个大小岛屿。在东海面，有位于朝鲜东部通川海面的卵岛、吉州东南海面的洋岛和元山港外的丽岛、薪岛、熊岛等十多个大小岛屿。以上岛屿，距离海岸远者十多公里，近者不到一公里。
    在过去朝鲜反侵略战争中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的海防部队曾在海面上和岛屿上与敌军进行过许多次胜利的战斗，收复了许多大小岛屿。如在朝鲜西部铁山半岛的海面上，除大小腊岛等少数岛屿外，其他如大小和岛、椵岛、身弥岛、炭岛等约五十个大小岛屿，在朝鲜全线停火之前已为朝中人民军队所收复。
