Xinhua News Agency, August 16th: American news agencies, in coordination with the American authorities' conspiracy and having exhausted all means to slander the Korean-Chinese side for "mistreating" prisoners of war, have recently been unable to continue concealing the truth and have had to reveal some facts about the Korean-Chinese side giving humane treatment to prisoners of war.

According to a report by the United Press, repatriated American prisoner of war Corporal Pickowitz, in a conversation on the 15th, expressed his gratitude to a female doctor surnamed Wu in the Korean-Chinese prisoner of war camp who had saved the lives of many prisoners of war. He said, "She saved many lives. She used all her medicines liberally." He also said, "She performed an appendectomy on me, and the surgery was very good." He said that after the operation, "she sat beside me all night." He also said that after this doctor returned to work in Shanghai in October last year, "the comrades missed her very much." According to the Associated Press, Lieutenant Colonel McKenney, the British Commonwealth officer responsible for examining the bodies of British prisoners of war, also admitted to reporters on the 13th that he had not found any evidence that the Korean-Chinese side's treatment of prisoners of war was detrimental to their health. He said that the doctors in the Korean-Chinese prisoner of war camp "performed surgery very well."

According to the Associated Press, the first batch of eight Australian prisoners of war who arrived in Hong Kong from Japan on the 14th "looked very healthy." They told reporters that they were treated "quite well" in the Korean-Chinese prisoner of war camp.

    美国通讯社无法遮盖真象
    承认我方宽待战俘的事实
    【新华社十六日讯】配合美国当局的阴谋而用尽办法诬蔑朝中方面“虐待”战俘的美国通讯社，最近已无法继续遮盖真象，不得不透露出一些朝中方面给予战俘人道待遇的事实来。
    据合众社报道，被遣返的美国战俘下士培克威士十五日在谈话中，对朝中战俘营里一个救了许多战俘生命的姓吴的女医生表示感谢。他说，“她救了不少性命。她放手使用她所有的药品。”他又说，“她替我割盲肠，手术很好”。他说，在开刀以后“她通宵坐在我傍边”。他还说，这位医生在去年十月回到上海工作以后，“伙伴们都很挂念她。”据美联社报道，负责检查英国战俘身体的英联邦军官麦坎奈上校十三日也对记者承认，他并没有发现朝中方面对战俘的待遇有危害健康的证据。他说，朝中战俘营里的医生的“手术进行得很好”。
    据美联社报道，十四日第一批从日本抵达香港的八名澳大利亚战俘，“看起来都很健康”。他们对记者说，他们在朝中战俘营内受到的待遇“相当好”。
