    Second National Congress of the China Textile Trade Union Opens
    To Formulate the Tasks of Textile Workers in National Economic Construction
    The Second National Congress of the China Textile Trade Union opened in Tianjin on August 5. This congress will summarize the work since the First National Congress, and according to the tasks of the textile industry stipulated in the state's First Five-Year Plan and the spirit of the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Trade Union, formulate the tasks of Chinese textile workers as the country enters a period of planned economic construction. This congress will elect the Second National Committee and the Financial Review Committee of the China Textile Trade Union, and reward the textile industry labor models selected from all over the country.
    A total of 376 people, including representatives and observers of textile workers from all over the country, as well as textile industry labor models, are participating in this congress. Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Chen Weiji, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, Zhang Qinqiu and others were invited to attend the opening ceremony.
    Shao Jingwa, Vice Chairman of the First National Committee of the China Textile Trade Union, delivered the opening speech at the congress. Liu Ningyi delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. He encouraged all representatives and labor models to further develop their production enthusiasm and creativity, improve labor productivity, and improve quality, in order to realize industrialization and struggle for a gradual transition to a socialist society. Chen Shaomin, Chairman of the First National Committee of the China Textile Trade Union, made a report on "Basic Summary of the Work of the China Textile Trade Union in the Past Three Years and Future Tasks." Shao Jingwa made a report on the selection and awarding of labor models on behalf of the Labor Model Evaluation Committee.
    In his report, Chen Shaomin pointed out: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese textile workers have implemented the resolutions of the First National Congress of the China Textile Trade Union and have shown high enthusiasm and creativity, making China's textile production level break the highest record in the history of China's textile industry. In 1952, the total output of cotton yarn exceeded the highest annual output in history by 50.93 percent, and cotton cloth exceeded 67.25 percent. Complete sets of textile machinery that China could not manufacture in the past can now be manufactured. The increase in textile production has played a significant role in meeting people's needs and stabilizing prices, and has made certain contributions to national economic construction and the fight against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. In 1952, the number of cotton spindles in the country increased by more than 10 percent compared to 1949, and the number of looms increased by more than 11 percent. With the development of production, state-owned textile factories across the country have invested more than 250 billion yuan in the past three years to improve ventilation, cooling equipment, and machine safety devices, significantly reducing workshop temperatures and unprecedentedly improving labor conditions. Hospitals, female worker hygiene rooms, nurseries, and children's schools in textile factories across the country have all increased significantly. Wage reforms have been carried out in state-owned factories and some private factories. The wages of workers in state-owned textile factories across the country increased by 34.7 percent in 1952 compared to 1949. As production developed and the number of workers increased, the textile trade union organization also developed and consolidated. As of the end of 1952, the textile trade union had more than 647,000 members. In the past three years, more than 19,000 labor models have been trained, and a large number of cadres have been sent to the Party, the Youth League, the government, and higher-level trade unions and enterprise organs. Comrade Chen Shaomin summarized the main experiences of the textile trade union in the past three years under the leadership of the Communist Party in implementing the policy of "facing production." She said: The China Textile Trade Union has grasped the main departments of fine yarn and weaving in the textile production process, cooperated with the administration, summarized and vigorously promoted advanced experiences of decisive significance such as the Hao Jianxiu work method and the 1951 weaving work method across the country, and launched a movement to innovate textile production, thereby improving overall work. Trade union workers have found the path to face production in the process of summarizing and promoting. Improving labor conditions is an indispensable and important measure to improve labor productivity, and production and safety are unified and inseparable. Running collective welfare undertakings can not only directly improve the lives of workers and staff, but also cultivate workers' and staff's collectivist ideas, encourage the production enthusiasm of the masses, and enable workers and staff to experience the bright prospects of a socialist society from their actual lives.
    After criticizing the shortcomings and errors in the past work of the textile trade union, Comrade Chen Shaomin put forward the future tasks of Chinese textile workers: The Chinese textile industry shoulders an important mission for national industrialization, and must further improve labor productivity, produce more high-quality, low-priced, and novel textile products to meet the growing needs of the people across the country, and accumulate a large amount of funds for the country's development of heavy industry. In the first five-year construction plan, the government plans to increase a large number of spindles, which is a very large task, and all textile workers should work hard to complete the task of building new factories. At the same time, in the existing textile industry, there are still many private, joint state-private, local state-owned and a small number of poorer state-owned factories with lower machine efficiency. These factories should improve enterprise management and improve technical level in production to gradually improve machine efficiency and give full play to the role of existing textile equipment. If the machine efficiency of these factories can be improved to the level of advanced state-owned factories, the increased output would be equal to the output of one million spindles. To this end, she called on trade union organizations at all levels to widely carry out labor competitions based on doing a good job in group work and formulating group and individual plans, implement group and individual "increase production and save money lists," summarize and promote advanced experience, increase production, improve quality, practice strict economy, reduce costs, and strive to overfulfill the five-year construction plan of the textile industry. Trade union organizations at all levels must also raise labor protection work to an important position in trade union work, implement the policy of safe production, eliminate deaths due to work, greatly reduce work-related injuries and diseases, and increase attendance rates. Trade union organizations at all levels must also summarize the experience of improving the lives and welfare of workers and staff, and gradually improve the lives of workers and staff and improve their health level on the basis of developing production. It is also necessary to strengthen political, cultural, and technical education, improve the political, cultural, and technical level of workers and staff according to the needs of national construction and the requirements of the broad masses of workers and staff, and cultivate a large number of talents for the country. Doing a good job in the production of private enterprises is beneficial to national economic construction and to the working class and the people of the whole country. Therefore, trade union organizations at all levels must strengthen trade union work in private enterprises. In order to complete the above tasks, the textile trade union must strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of the trade union. Trade union cadres must clearly recognize that under the people's democratic system, the most central task of trade union organizations is to organize and educate the masses to do a good job in production; the trade union must closely link with the masses under the leadership of the Communist Party in order to be able to undertake its tasks.

    中国纺织工会第二次全国代表大会开幕
    将制定纺织工人在国家经济建设中的任务
    中国纺织工会第二次全国代表大会于八月五日在天津开幕。这次大会将总结第一次全国代表大会以来的工作，并根据国家第一个五年计划所规定的纺织工业的任务和中国工会第七次全国代表大会决议的精神，制定中国纺织工人在国家开始进入有计划的经济建设时期的任务。这次大会将选举中国纺织工会第二届全国委员会和经费审查委员会，奖励全国各地评选出来的纺织工业劳动模范。
    参加这次大会的有全国纺织职工的代表和列席代表以及纺织工业劳动模范共三百七十六人。中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一，中央人民政府纺织工业部副部长陈维稷、张琴秋等应邀出席了开幕式。
    大会由中国纺织工会第一届全国委员会副主席邵井蛙致开幕词。刘宁一代表中华全国总工会向大会致贺词。他勉励全体代表和劳动模范今后要更进一步地发挥生产积极性和创造性，提高劳动生产率，提高质量，以实现工业化并为逐步过渡到社会主义社会而斗争。中国纺织工会第一届全国委员会主席陈少敏做了“三年来中国纺织工会工作的基本总结和今后任务”的报告，邵井蛙代表劳动模范评选委员会做了评选奖励劳动模范的报告。
    陈少敏在报告中指出：三年来中国纺织工人在中国共产党的领导下，贯彻了中国纺织工会第一次全国代表大会的决议，发挥了高度的积极性、创造性，使我国纺织生产水平突破了中国纺织工业史上的最高纪录。一九五二年棉纱总产量超过历史上最高年产量百分之五十点九三，棉布超过百分之六十七点二五。过去我国不能制造的整套纺织机械，现在已能制造了。纺织生产的提高，对满足人民需要和稳定物价，起了很大作用，对国家经济建设和抗美援朝都有一定的贡献。一九五二年全国棉纺纱锭比一九四九年增加了百分之十以上，布机增加了百分之十一以上。随着生产的发展，三年来，各国营纺织厂共化了两千五百多亿元，改善通风、降温设备和机器安全装置，使车间温度显著降低，劳动条件空前改善。全国纺织厂的医院、女工卫生室、托儿所、子弟学校等都有显著增加。国营厂和部分私营厂进行了工资改革。全国国营纺织厂工人的工资一九五二年比一九四九年增加了百分之三十四点七。生产发展了，工人增加了，纺织工会组织也发展和巩固了，截至一九五二年底，纺织工会已有会员六十四万七千多人。三年来，共培养了一万九千多劳动模范，向党、团、政府及上级工会和企业机关输送了大批干部。陈少敏同志总结了三年来纺织工会在共产党的领导下，在贯彻“面向生产”的方针下取得的主要经验。她说：中国纺织工会抓住了细纱和织布这两个纺织生产过程中的主要部门，配合行政，总结并在全国大力推广了郝建秀工作法、一九五一织布工作法等有决定意义的先进经验，展开了纺织生产的革新运动，因而改进了全面工作。工会工作者在总结与推广的过程中，摸到了面向生产的门径。改善劳动条件是提高劳动生产率的必不可少的重要措施，生产和安全是统一而不可分割的。举办集体福利事业，既可以直接改善职工生活，又可以培养职工的集体主义思想，鼓舞群众的生产热情，使职工群众从实际生活中体会到社会主义社会的光明远景。
    陈少敏同志在批判了过去纺织工会工作中的缺点和错误后，提出中国纺织工人今后的任务：中国纺织工业对国家工业化担负着重要的使命，必须进一步提高劳动生产率，生产更多的物美价廉、花样翻新的纺织品，来满足全国人民日益增长的需要，为国家发展重工业积累大量资金。在第一个五年建设计划中，政府计划增加大批纱锭，这是一个很大的任务，全体纺织工人应为完成建设新厂的任务而努力。同时，在现有的纺织工业中，还有不少机器效率较低的私营、公私合营、地方国营和少数较差的国营厂，这些厂在生产中要改进企业管理，提高技术水平，逐步提高机器效率，充分地发挥现有纺织设备的作用，如果能把这些厂的机器效率提高到先进国营厂的水平，其增产的数量，就等于一百万纱锭的产量。为此，她号召各级工会组织必须以做好小组工作、订好小组和个人计划为基础，广泛地开展劳动竞赛，实行小组和个人“增产节约单”，总结和推广先进经验，增加生产，提高质量，厉行节约，降低成本，为争取超额完成纺织工业的五年建设计划而努力。各级工会组织还必须把劳动保护工作提到工会工作的重要地位上来，贯彻安全生产方针，消灭因工死亡，大大减少工伤事故和疾病，提高出勤率。各级工会组织还必须总结改善职工生活福利工作的经验，在发展生产的基础上，逐步改善职工生活，提高职工健康水平。还必须根据国家建设的需要和广大职工群众的要求，加强政治、文化、技术教育，提高职工群众的政治、文化、技术水平，为国家培养大批人才。搞好私营企业的生产，对国家经济建设，对工人阶级和全国人民都是有利的。因此纺织工会各级组织必须加强私营企业中的工会工作。为了完成上述任务，纺织工会必须加强工会的思想建设和组织建设。工会干部必须明确认识：在人民民主制度下，工会组织的最中心的任务是组织、教育群众搞好生产；工会必须在共产党的领导下，密切联系群众，才能担负起自己的任务。（新华社）
