Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 19th: On August 19th, our side repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war to the other side, and 306 Korean prisoners of war, including 6 wounded and sick prisoners of war, for a total of 456. Among the non-Korean prisoners of war, there were 75 American prisoners of war and 75 British prisoners of war.

Today, the other side repatriated 602 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side, which is about 1,800 less than the number stipulated in the agreement between the two sides.

The returned captured personnel from our side said: On the evening of the 17th, they were beaten with wooden sticks by U.S. soldiers at Yongdungpo Station for singing and celebrating their return to the motherland, resulting in injuries to nine people.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 19th: Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel who have been repatriated said that the U.S. side used torture such as wire cages, wooden cages, and water prisons to persecute our captured personnel who firmly demanded repatriation.

Duan Tianqiang, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who had been imprisoned by the U.S. side three times, said that he had been imprisoned twice in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. Once, he was imprisoned in a narrow wire cage. Countless iron thorns more than an inch long protruded from the wire cage. He could only squat inside without moving. Later, he became dizzy from squatting and his body swayed, and he was pierced all over his body until his skin broke and bled. He was locked up for two hours, and passed out when he came out of the cage. Another time, he was imprisoned in a short, small rectangular wooden cage. He could only lie motionless inside, unable to sit or stand up. He was locked up for more than thirty days. The third time was in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island, he and five other captured personnel from our side were locked up together in a very small cell, they could only sit tightly together, unable to lie down and sleep at night. They were locked up for twenty-nine days.

Cao You, a returning personnel from our side, said that he had been imprisoned in a water prison in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp. The water prison was pitch black, with a foul smell, and the bottom was a pool of sewage. The wooden cage for imprisoning prisoners of war was soaked in this sewage. The wooden cage was very small, and he could only curl up inside, unable to move. There were also many mosquitoes in the water prison, which bit his skin until it was red, swollen, and festering.

Fu Wansheng, a returning personnel from our side, said that in early February 1951, in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp, he and several other captured personnel from our side were imprisoned in a cellar ten meters long and three meters wide. The cellar was very damp, and it was muddy when it rained. Every night, the U.S.-Syngman Rhee secret agents escorted them to tents near the cellar for interrogation. The U.S.-Syngman Rhee secret agents used various tortures to force them to reveal military intelligence. Fu Wansheng was locked up for forty-two days. Because he was always unwilling to betray the motherland, he was beaten three times and subjected to electric shock seven times.

    朝中方面和对方八月十九日继续遣返战俘
    我方归来人员愤怒控诉美方的迫害罪行
    【新华社开城十九日电】八月十九日，我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百五十名，朝鲜籍战俘三百零六名，其中包括伤病战俘六名，共四百五十六名。在非朝鲜籍战俘中，有美国籍战俘和英国籍战俘各七十五名。
    今天对方遣送给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员六百零二名，这个数字比双方协议规定的数字少一千八百名左右。
    今天归来的我方被俘人员说：十七日晚，他们在永登浦车站上因为唱歌欢庆返回祖国，美军就用木棍毒打他们，结果有九人被打伤。
    【新华社开城十九日电】遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员说，美方用铁丝笼、木笼、水牢等酷刑，迫害坚决要求遣返回国的我方被俘人员。
    曾被美方囚禁过三次的中国人民志愿军被俘人员段天强说，在巨济岛美方战俘营内，他被囚禁过两次。有一次他被囚禁在一个狭小的铁丝笼里。铁丝笼内伸出无数一寸多长的铁刺。他只能蹲在里面不动。后来他蹲得头发晕了，身子摇晃起来，混身就被刺得皮破血流。他一直被关禁了两个钟头，走出笼子就昏了过去。另外一次他被囚禁在一个又矮又小的长方形的木笼里。他只能一动也不动地躺在里面，不能坐和站起来。他一直被关禁了三十多天。第三次是在济州岛美方战俘营内，他和另外五个我方被俘人员一起被关禁在一间非常狭小的牢房里，他们只能挤得紧紧地坐在一起，夜里不能躺着睡觉。他们一直被关禁了二十九天。
    我方归来人员曹友说，他在釜山战俘营内，曾被囚禁在水牢里。水牢里一团漆黑，恶臭难闻，下面是一片污水。囚禁战俘的木笼就浸在这污水内。木笼非常狭小，他只能蜷缩在里面，不能动弹。水牢里还有许多蚊子，咬得他皮肤红肿溃烂。
    我方归来人员傅万生说，一九五一年二月初在釜山战俘营内，他与另外几个我方被俘人员被囚禁在一个长十公尺、宽三公尺的地窖内。地窖内非常潮湿，下雨天更是泥泞不堪。每天晚上，美李特务把他们押到地窖附近的帐篷里去受审问。美李特务用各种酷刑强迫他们供出军事情报。傅万生被关禁了四十二天。由于他始终不愿背叛祖国，遭到三次毒打、七次电刑。
