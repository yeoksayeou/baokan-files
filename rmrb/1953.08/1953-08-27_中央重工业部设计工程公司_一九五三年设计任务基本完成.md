The Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government basically completed its 1953 design tasks by the end of July and began preparations for the 1954 design work.

The 1953 design tasks of the Central Heavy Industry Department's Design Company were quite heavy, but thanks to many effective measures, the needs of construction were basically guaranteed. Since the beginning of this year, by summarizing last year's design work, especially organizing design personnel to promote the Soviet Union's advanced working method of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" and establishing and improving the quality responsibility system, the design efficiency has been significantly improved, and the design quality has been guaranteed. For example, the design efficiency of the company's electrical lighting department has increased three to four times compared to the past; the design of the large motor manufacturing plant building with 25,000 square meters of all-metal structure for the Harbin Electrical Engineering Fourth Factory, and the design of many complex key projects such as the large-scale Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, have also basically guaranteed the needs of construction. The company has also completed the surveying and mapping tasks of more than 200 large and small projects, providing a scientific basis for design. In terms of the design of standard dormitories, the design company organized designers to go deep into the users to solicit opinions and requirements for standard dormitories, increasing the design styles of standard dormitories from four to thirteen, and trying to adopt the most economical and suitable building materials in the design while ensuring project quality. This is of great significance for solving the difficulty of insufficient design strength in the Northeast region.

At present, on the basis of basically completing the 1953 design tasks, some designers of the design company have begun to prepare for the 1954 design work. They have formed a special agency, which is studying the situation of various design tasks and collecting design data. In order to vigorously train specialized design talents in industrial heating, ventilation, electrical lighting, and power, and to meet the requirements of next year's design tasks, the design company has sent some designers to the design department and technical cadre school of Anshan Iron and Steel Company for study, and has organized several visiting groups to go to Anshan, Harbin, Hulan, and other places to solicit opinions on design from construction departments and construction units.

    中央重工业部设计工程公司
    一九五三年设计任务基本完成
    中央人民政府重工业部设计公司到七月底已基本上完成了一九五三年的设计任务，并开始进行一九五四年的设计准备工作。
    中央重工业部设计公司一九五三年的设计任务相当繁重，但由于采取了许多有效措施，基本上保证了施工的需要。今年以来，该公司通过总结去年的设计工作，特别是组织设计人员推行了苏联的“按指示图表组织有节奏生产”的先进工作方法和建立、健全质量责任制度等以后，设计效率有了显著提高，并保证了设计质量。如该公司电照科的设计效率比过去提高了三倍到四倍；哈尔滨电工四厂全部金属结构的二万五千平方公尺的大型电机制造厂房的设计、规模巨大的北京钢铁学院等许多复杂的重点工程设计，也都基本上保证了施工的需要。该公司还完成了二百多个大小工程的勘测任务，为进行设计提供了科学的根据。在标准宿舍的设计方面，设计公司组织了设计人员深入用户征求对标准宿舍的意见和要求，把标准宿舍的设计样式由四种增加到十三种，并在保证工程质量的原则下，尽量在设计中采用最经济最适用的建筑材料。这对解决东北区设计力量不足的困难，有着很大的意义。
    目前，设计公司在基本完成一九五三年设计任务的基础上，部分设计人员已开始进行一九五四年设计工作的各项准备。他们已组成了一个专门机构，正在研究各项设计任务的情况，搜集设计资料。为了大力培养工业采暖、通风、电照和动力等专门的设计人才，适应明年设计任务的要求，设计公司已派出一部分设计人员到鞍山钢铁公司的设计部门和技术干部学校学习，并组织了若干个访问小组，分赴鞍山、哈尔滨、呼兰等地，广泛地征求建设部门和施工单位对设计的意见。    （新华社）
