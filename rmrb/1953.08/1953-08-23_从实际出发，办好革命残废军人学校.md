    Since the promulgation of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government's "Decision on Strengthening Regular Education in Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Schools" more than a year ago, regular education for revolutionary disabled soldiers has been greatly strengthened due to the conscientious implementation of this decision in various regions, and the tendency of "emphasizing care over education" for revolutionary disabled soldiers has been corrected. Therefore, the achievements of the teaching work in revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools in various regions are significant. These achievements are mainly reflected in the universal elimination of illiteracy among the students, with some reaching the level of higher primary school or junior high school. At the same time, approximately ten percent of the students have participated in various national construction projects due to improved cultural and scientific knowledge. According to statistics from twenty revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools in eight provinces, including Shandong, 6.7 percent of the secondary school students will graduate from junior high school at the end of this semester, and more than 50 percent of the primary school students will enter junior high school in the second half of the year. By the end of the second half of the year, more than 10 percent of the secondary school students will graduate. These figures indicate that the cultural level and scientific knowledge of the students in revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools are rapidly improving, and it is entirely possible and necessary to train them to become talents and backbones in various construction projects. These figures show that the decision of the Government Administration Council on strengthening regular education for revolutionary disabled soldiers more than a year ago was completely correct, and it is incorrect to underestimate the significance of revolutionary disabled soldiers participating in national construction.
    The achievements of implementing regular education in revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools in various regions are the main aspect, but some regions have also experienced deviations of varying degrees of impatience. This deviation is mainly reflected in an incorrect understanding of "regular education," overemphasizing the students' advanced studies. Some schools have even mobilized 60 percent of the students to enter universities. Consequently, the teaching plans reflect a large number of subjects and a pursuit of all-round development. The length of schooling is required to reach the level of senior high school from illiteracy within two years. The root cause of this deviation is a lack of understanding of the characteristics of revolutionary disabled soldiers and the current needs of national construction. They only unilaterally emphasize the policy of "regular education" and subjectively train talents for national construction. What are the characteristics of revolutionary disabled soldiers? They have undergone training in revolutionary wars, possess a high degree of political awareness, and urgently demand to participate in national construction. However, their cultural level is relatively low, some are even illiterate, and most are beyond the age of secondary school or even university. After the start of large-scale national construction, not only are construction talents with specialized skills and scientific knowledge needed, but also cadres who have been tested by the revolution and have a high degree of political awareness. Therefore, the regular education of revolutionary disabled soldiers must be carried out in accordance with their own characteristics and the objective needs of national construction, and cannot deviate from these characteristics and needs. Therefore, the regular education of revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools is not only very different from that of ordinary regular primary and secondary schools, but also different from workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools. The task of workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools is to cultivate the conditions for workers, peasants, and worker-peasant cadres to enter institutions of higher learning for further studies, while the task of revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools is mainly to improve their cultural level and cultivate their ability to find employment quickly. Therefore, the regular education of revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools first requires running primary schools well, using two years to basically complete the primary school curriculum through accelerated literacy, and then enter junior high school, and then use two years to complete the junior high school curriculum with Chinese language as the main subject, supplemented by political and other basic scientific knowledge education. The curriculum of revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools at the junior high school stage must not be as numerous as that of workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools, and it is even more impossible to put forward the slogan of "all-round development." After completing the junior high school curriculum, these students can be uniformly assigned by the personnel departments to government agencies and enterprises to take on administrative, personnel, judicial, security and other work. However, this does not mean that all students in revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools do not need further education and cannot pursue further education. In fact, there are indeed a small number of students in revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools who have the conditions to enter universities or vocational schools and are also willing to pursue further education. These students can apply for the local workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools after graduating from primary school. If there are more such students in a province and the local workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools cannot accommodate them, appropriate classes can be attached to the revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools to cultivate their ability to pursue further education. Even when necessary, with the approval of the provincial people's government or the administrative committee of the greater administrative region, revolutionary disabled soldiers' secondary schools with the nature of workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools can also be established.
    National large-scale economic construction has begun, and all aspects are urgently in need of cadres. Revolutionary disabled soldiers who were gloriously wounded in revolutionary wars and have contributed to the country are also urgently demanding to improve their culture and continue to participate in national construction. Therefore, the people's governments of various regions should order the civil affairs departments to earnestly take on the important responsibility of managing, cultivating, and educating revolutionary disabled soldiers to become talents for national construction. Other relevant departments of the provincial people's governments, such as the education, personnel, and health departments, should also provide practical leadership and assistance to relevant businesses in accordance with the spirit of the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government in July last year, so as to further improve the revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools.

    从实际出发，办好革命残废军人学校
    李芳远
    中央人民政府政务院“关于加强革命残废军人学校正规教育的决定”公布以来已经一年多了。一年多来，由于各地认真地贯彻了这一决定，对革命残废军人的正规教育已经大大加强，对革命残废军人“重养不重教”的偏向已经得到纠正。因而，各地革命残废军人学校教学工作的成绩是很大的。这些成绩主要表现在普遍扫除了学员中的文盲，有的已经达到高小或初中程度。同时，约有百分之十的学员，由于提高了文化和科学知识，已经参加了国家的各项建设。根据山东等八个省二十个革命残废军人学校的统计，今年上学期终了将有百分之六点七的中学学员从初中毕业，今年下学期，将有百分之五十多的小学学员进入初中，今年下学期终了将有百分之十以上的中学学员毕业。这些数字表明，革命残废军人学校学员的文化程度和科学知识正在迅速地提高，培养他们成为各种建设中的人才和骨干是完全可能的和必要的；这些数字表明一年多以前政务院关于加强革命残废军人正规教育的决定是完全正确的，而对革命残废军人参加国家建设的意义估计不足是不对的。
    各地革命残废军人学校实施正规教育的成绩是主要的，但有些地区也发生了程度不等的操之过急的偏向，这种偏向主要表现在对“正规教育”作了不正确的理解，过分强调了学员的深造，有些学校竟动员百分之六十的学员升入大学。因而反映在教学计划上是科目繁多，齐头并进，反映在修业年限上是要求在两年之内由文盲达到高中程度。产生这种偏向的根源是不了解革命残废军人的特点，也不了解当前国家建设对他们的需要，只是片面地强调“正规教育”的方针，主观地在那里培养国家建设人才。革命残废军人的特点是什么呢？就是他们经过革命战争的锻炼，具有高度的政治觉悟，迫切要求参加国家建设，但文化程度较低，有的甚至是文盲，大部超过了中学以至大学的学龄。而国家大规模建设开始以后，不但需要具有专门技术和科学知识的建设人才，同样也需要受过革命考验，政治觉悟较高的干部。因此对革命残废军人的正规教育就必须按照革命残废军人的本身特点和国家建设的客观需要来进行，而不能离开这些特点和需要。因此，革命残废军人学校的正规教育，不但和一般的正规小学和中学有很大不同，就是和工农速成中学也有所区别。工农速成中学的任务是培养工人、农民及工农干部升入高等学校继续深造的条件，而革命残废军人学校的任务主要是提高他们的文化程度培养他们迅速就业的能力。因此革命残废军人学校的正规教育首先要求办好小学，以二年时间，用速成识字基本上完成小学课程，然后进入初级中学，再以二年时间完成以语文为主的辅之以政治的和其他科学基本知识教育的初中课程。革命残废军人学校初中阶段的课程决不能像工农速成中学那样繁多，更不能提出“齐头并进、全面发展”的口号。这些学员在完成初中课程以后，即可由人事部门统一分配到政府机关和企业单位担任行政、人事、司法、保卫等工作。但是，这并不是说所有革命残废军人学校的学员都不需要深造和不可能深造。实际上在革命残废军人学校的学员中的确也有一小部分具有升入大学或专科学校的条件同时本人也志愿深造的。这一部分学员在小学毕业后，即可投考当地的工农速成中学。如果此类学员较多的省份，当地工农速成中学又无法容纳时，可在革命残废军人学校内附设适当班次，培养他们深造的能力，甚至在必要时，经过省人民政府或大行政区行政委员会的批准，还可以举办类似工农速成中学性质的革命残废军人中等学校。
    国家大规模经济建设已经开始，各方面正在迫切需要干部，在革命战争中光荣负伤、功在国家的革命残废军人也在迫切要求提高文化，继续参加国家建设。因此，各地人民政府应责成民政部门切实负起管理培养和教育革命残废军人成为国家建设人才的重大责任，各省人民政府的其他有关部门，如教育、人事、卫生部门，也应根据去年七月中央人民政府政务院决定的精神，给有关业务以切实的领导和协助，以便把革命残废军人学校进一步办好。
