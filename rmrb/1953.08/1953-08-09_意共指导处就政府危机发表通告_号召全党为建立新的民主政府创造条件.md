Xinhua News Agency, Rome, August 6th: TASS reported from Rome on August 5th: The Italian Communist Party's Guidance Department, after meeting to study the domestic political situation and the parliamentary situation, issued a circular stating:

    The reason for the fall of the Gasperi cabinet is that it attempted to disregard the results of the June 7th election, maintain a government condemned by the voters, and continue and strengthen its policies.

    The Communist Party Guidance Department believes that it is now necessary to establish a stable democratic government that can reflect the aspirations of the entire country and solve the most important current problems from a united standpoint.

    What Italy needs today, first and foremost, is a government that can defend the republican system chosen by the people and view the constitution as a general program for carrying out sweeping reforms. Therefore, it is necessary to reject and condemn any conspiracies by the Christian Democratic Party government to collude with clerical and fascist forces. This conspiracy is the first step toward a serious political and social crisis.

    In terms of domestic policy, the Communist Party demands a policy of peaceful resolution of problems, adherence to the constitution, and equality of civil rights.

    This means first implementing a general amnesty, stopping any discrimination against citizens, and enabling everyone to freely enjoy the various rights guaranteed by the constitution.

    In terms of foreign policy, the Communist Party demands the formation of a government that can represent the desire for peace of the vast majority of Italians, regard defending national interests from foreign interference as its inescapable responsibility, and improve our country's relations with all countries in the world, especially trade relations. This government should actively participate in negotiations and agreements aimed at easing international tensions.

    The new government should immediately convene a meeting of all trade union organizations to formulate measures that can meet the demands of the working people and guarantee production.

    The Italian Communist Party Guidance Department calls on all party organizations and members to pay attention to the development of the situation, provide broad explanations to all citizens, and publicize the Communist Party's position to the broad masses; it supports any joint initiatives that are conducive to reaching an agreement that can create the preconditions for establishing a new majority faction and a new government that conforms to the will expressed by the voters on June 7th.

Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: TASS reported from Rome on August 3rd: The Italian National Peace Council summarized the results of the Italian National Peace Conference held in Rome on July 22nd and 23rd and issued a communique.

    The communique stated: "Today, it is impossible to form a stable and strong government that Italy needs if one disregards the desire of the broad masses of the country to implement policies to ease international tensions and to demand peace and the preservation of national rights."

    The communique emphasized that Italy needs a policy that can enable it to participate in all initiatives that advocate peace negotiations and that can free it from the unbearable expenditures caused by the arms race.

    In the communique, the Italian National Peace Council endorsed "the instructions put forward after discussions at the Italian National Peace Conference, which emphasized the need to strive for the development of normal economic, trade, and cultural relations with all countries (regardless of political and social systems).

    To this end, it is necessary to take action to put Italy's foreign policy on a new path and make an effective contribution to the cause of easing international tensions."

Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: TASS reported from Rome: The Italian newspaper "Avanti!" reported that the speakers of both houses of parliament and various parliamentary groups are constantly receiving letters, telegrams, and resolutions signed by thousands of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, in which they demand the establishment of a democratic government, a government of national unity and peace in Italy.

    Tenant farmers and hired laborers in a manor near Florence demanded in their letter that parliament support a government that can meet the demands of the working people. Similar demands were made in resolutions passed by many farmers' conferences in the provinces of Siena, Ferrara, and Pistoia.

    Metallurgical workers in Modena passed a resolution at their conference insisting on "the rapid establishment of a democratic, republican, and anti-fascist government that will pursue policies to ease domestic and international tensions, implement far-reaching reform measures, and provide as much work as possible for all workers and seek welfare for the poor."

    Workers in many enterprises in Bologna, Milan, and Turin have also sent similar resolutions and telegrams to various parliamentary groups.

    意共指导处就政府危机发表通告
    号召全党为建立新的民主政府创造条件
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社罗马五日讯：意大利共产党指导处开会研究了国内政治形势和议会情况后，发表通告说：
    加斯贝利内阁之所以垮台，是因为这个内阁企图把六月七日的选举结果置之脑后，而维持一个选民所谴责的政府，继续并加强它的政策。
    共产党指导处认为：现在必须建立一个稳固的民主政府，这个政府要能够反映全国的愿望，能够从团结一致的立场出发，去解决当前最重要的问题。
    今天意大利需要的，首先是这样一个政府：它能够保卫由人民挑选的共和制度，它要把宪法看成是大刀阔斧地实行改革的总纲领。因此，必须排斥和谴责天主教民主党政府跟教权派势力和法西斯势力进行任何勾搭的阴谋。这种阴谋是走向严重的政治危机和社会危机的第一步。
    在内政政策方面，共产党要求采取和平解决问题、遵守宪法、公民权利平等的方针。
    这就是首先要实行大赦，停止对公民的任何歧视，使每个人都能自由享受宪法所保障的各种权利。
    在对外政策方面，共产党要求组织这样一个政府：它能够代表绝大多数意大利人渴求和平的愿望，把捍卫民族利益免受外国干涉一事看成是自己不可推诿的责任，改善我国和世界各国的关系，首先是贸易关系。这个政府要积极参加为了缓和国际紧张局势而进行的谈判和协议。
    新政府应当立即召集所有工会组织举行会议，来拟订能够满足劳动人民要求和保证生产的措施。
    意大利共产党指导处号召党的所有组织和党员留心情况的发展并且向全体公民作广泛的解释，向广大群众宣传共产党的立场；它支持任何有利于达成协议的联合倡议，这种协议能为建立符合于六月七日选民所表示的意志的新的多数派和新的政府创造先决条件。
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社罗马三日讯：意大利全国和平理事会总结了七月二十二日和二十三日在罗马召开的意大利全国和平大会的成果，并发表了公报。
    公报说：“今天，如果不顾国内广泛群众要求执行缓和国际紧张局势的政策和要求和平与保存民族权利的愿望，就不可能组成一个意大利所需要的稳定的、强有力的政府。”
    公报强调指出，意大利需要这样一个政策：它能够使意大利参与一切拥护和平谈判的倡议，并能够把它从扩军运动所造成的不堪忍受的开支中解救出来。
    在公报中，意大利全国和平理事会赞成“意大利全国和平大会在讨论后所提出的指示，其中强调需要为与所有国家（不管政治和社会制度的不同）发展正常的经济、贸易和文化关系而奋斗。
    为此目的，就需要以行动来使意大利的外交政策走上新的道路，并对缓和国际紧张局势的事业作出有效的贡献。”
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利“前进报”报道，上下两院的议长以及各议会党团不断收到有几千名工人、农民和知识分子签名的信件、电报和决议，他们在这些文件中要求在意大利建立一个民主政府，一个举国一致的与和平的政府。
    佛罗伦萨附近一个庄园中的佃农和雇农在他们的信中要求议会支持一个能满足劳动人民要求的政府。在西埃那、斐拉拉和皮斯托雅诸省，许多农民大会所通过的决议也提出了类似的要求。
    摩登纳的冶金工人在他们举行的大会上通过一项决议，坚持要求“迅速成立一个民主、共和与反法西斯的政府，这个政府将奉行缓和国内和国际紧张局势的政策，实行远大的改革措施，尽可能使一切工人都有工作并为贫穷者谋取福利。”
    波伦亚、米兰和都灵许多企业的工人也曾向各议会党团发出类似的决议和电报。
