    Central South Region is Rectifying Local State-Owned Industry

    Local state-owned industrial enterprises in the Central South region have successively launched rectification work by province and city, laying the foundation for steady development in the future.

    Local state-owned industry in the Central South region accounts for a large proportion of the region's industry. In the past, these industries played a significant role in serving national construction and supplying local people with means of production and means of livelihood. At the same time, they solved the employment problems of many workers, accumulated funds, and trained cadres. However, because the Central South region and the provinces originally lacked unified leadership organizations for local industry, the development was unorganized and highly prone to blind spots. For example, Hunan Province developed sevenfold in three years, and three special districts in southern Hunan developed fifteenfold. The most important issue was a lack of clarity regarding the guiding principles for local industrial construction. Insufficient consideration was given to various conditions, and many developments that should not have occurred did, resulting in significant losses. For example, the Hongjiang Paper Mill in Hunan spent over 4 billion yuan to build, but has not yet commenced operations due to paper overproduction. The Yongxing Coal Mine in Hunan, without proper exploration, assumed its resources were sufficient for twenty years of mining and spent 330 million yuan to build a dedicated highway, only to find that it ran out of coal by March of this year. The Dapu Coal Mine and the Daming Mountain Tungsten-Antimony Mine in Guangxi also discovered insufficient mineral resources after basic construction had begun, forcing them to shut down, resulting in losses of 3.7 billion yuan. In Guangdong and Hunan, several burlap bag factories and egg product factories were closed due to overproduction or a lack of sales outlets for their products. In addition, many factories, due to unclear production guidelines, produced products that were neither marketable in cities nor suitable for farmers' needs, resulting in large amounts of inventory backlog. This was compounded by dispersed resources, weak leadership, and chaotic production conditions. In Jiangmen City, Guangdong, the deputy chief of the Industry and Commerce Section and the secretary of the Finance Committee of Shunde County each held the position of director of five factories, weakening leadership over production. This resulted in disorganized labor and excessive non-production personnel. Similar bloated organizational structures were found in certain factories in Henan, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces. In Jiangxi's Gannan Paper Mill, management personnel accounted for 50% of the total workforce. Many "new-style agricultural implements" manufactured by mechanical farm implement factories were heavily stockpiled due to their low quality, high prices, or unsuitability for rural needs. This year, the value of backlogged products from local industries throughout the region totaled over 200 billion yuan (with other causes as well), causing significant losses to the state.

    To change this chaotic situation and lay the foundation for the steady development of local industry in the future, the provinces and cities of the Central South region have successively carried out rectification work since last year. Wuhan City completed rectification at the beginning of this year, Hunan Province basically completed it in July, and most of the factories and mines above the special district and city level in Hubei Province have also been completed. Other provinces, such as Jiangxi, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Henan, are actively working on it.

    The rectification work first starts with examining the production and operation of each factory and mine, thoroughly understanding the situation, and then classifying them according to three criteria: whether they serve state-owned mines, meet the production and living needs of local people, and whether raw materials and finished products are sourced locally and oriented toward rural areas. Based on this, decisions are made to expand, maintain, unify, shrink, merge, or close them. Hunan Province also decided to transfer factories and mines under the jurisdiction of special commissioner offices to the leadership of the Provincial Department of Industry and county/city governments. Out of 530 factories and mines participating in the rectification in the province, 499 units remained after the rectification, and four units belonging to the state-owned scope were transferred to the management of the central government and various professional systems. In Hubei Province, after the rectification of 362 factories and mines, 286 were placed under the leadership of the Provincial Department of Industry's Enterprise Company, and 30 units were transferred to the management of the Grain Bureau and cooperatives.

    In the rectification work, Hunan Province first focused on criticizing cadres' one-sided understanding of the development of local industry, clarifying that industrial construction must be developed in a planned manner under the unified leadership of the central government to enable the country to industrialize as soon as possible. It also criticized the newly emerging idea among cadres of "abandoning the mess," clarifying that this rectification is precisely for the sake of steady development in the future. At the same time, special emphasis was placed on carefully handling the livelihood issues of laid-off workers. In Hunan Province, a total of more than 6,000 workers were laid off, with nearly 5,000 in the three special districts of southern Hunan alone. In addition to the establishment of committees by relevant authorities to handle the matter, the deputy secretary of the CPC Southern Hunan District Committee and the county party secretaries personally took charge of this work, helping laid-off workers return to their hometowns to engage in production or transfer to factories and mines that were preparing to expand. The province has now largely completed this process.

    Units that have undergone rectification are actively establishing and improving various systems, improving business management, increasing production and quality, and reducing costs. The three special districts of southern Hunan recently received 1,200 rationalization proposals from workers, and many new developments have emerged in production. The iron-smelting furnace in the foundry workshop of the originally disorganized Shengli Machinery Factory increased its iron output from 1,500 catties per hour to 2,500 catties, the coke-to-iron ratio increased from 1:5 to 1:7, and the scrap rate decreased from 40% to 10%. The cost per ton of fire bricks produced by the Hunan Ceramics Company was reduced by one-third. The Shashi Power Plant in Hubei created a new record of 100 days of safe operation. The production value of each worker in the Xiangyang Machinery Factory has increased by nearly 100%.

    After completing the rectification, Wuhan City turned to improving business management. In the first half of this year, the labor productivity of the city's local industry increased by 7.68% compared to the same period last year, and its total output value increased by 45% due to the expansion of production. In the third quarter of this year, the city's local industry will focus on implementing planned management and initially establish a responsibility system in order to further increase production, quality, reduce costs, and expand sales.

### 中南区整顿地方国营工业

    中南区整顿地方国营工业
    中南区地方国营工业企业先后以省市为单位展开整顿工作，为今后稳步发展打下基础。
    中南地方国营工业占全区工业比重很大，这些工业过去在为国家建设服务与供应当地人民生产资料、生活资料方面，起了很大作用，同时解决了许多职工的就业问题，积累了资金和培养了干部。但是由于中南与各省原来没有地方工业的统一领导机构，下面自流发展，因此盲目性很大。如湖南省三年内发展了七倍，湘南三个专区发展了十五倍。最主要的是对地方工业建设方针认识不明确，没有认真考虑各种条件，许多不该发展的也发展了，造成很大损失。如湖南洪江造纸厂化了四十多亿兴建起来，因为纸张生产过剩，至今没有开工。湖南永兴煤矿没有经过勘探便认为其资源足够开采二十年，化三亿三千万元专门修了一条公路，结果至今年三月便没有煤了。广西大蒲煤矿与大明山钨锑矿也是在基本建设进行之后才发现矿源不足，只好停办，损失三十七亿元。广东与湖南还有若干麻袋厂、蛋品厂因为生产过剩或产品没有销路而关闭。另外还有许多工厂因为生产方针不明，所出产品既不能在城市推销，又不适合农民需要，造成大量积压。其次是力量分散，领导薄弱，生产情况很混乱。广东江门市工商科副科长与顺德县财委秘书均身兼五个厂的厂长，因此削弱了对生产的领导，结果劳动组织很乱，非生产人员过多。在河南、湖南、江西等省某些厂中也有类似机构庞大的现象。江西赣西南造纸厂的管理人员竟占全体职工百分之五十。许多机械农具厂制造的“新式农具”，因为质量低，价格高，或不适合农村需要而大量积压。今年全区地方工业积压的产品值两千多亿元（还有别的原因），给国家造成很大损失。
    为了改变这种混乱情况，并为地方工业今后稳步发展打下基础，中南各省市从去年开始，先后进行了整顿工作。武汉市于今年初整顿完毕，湖南省于七月基本结束，湖北省专区、市以上的厂矿也大部分完成。其他江西、广西、广东、河南等省也正积极着手进行中。
    整顿工作首先从检查各厂矿生产与经营着手，彻底摸清情况，然后根据其是否为国营厂矿服务、为当地人民生产与生活需要服务、以及在原料与成品的购销上是否就地取材、面向农村等三个条件，进行排队，分别决定扩大、维持、统一、紧缩、合并或关闭。湖南省还决定将专署所属厂矿分别交省工业厅和县市领导。该省参加整顿的五百三十个厂矿，经过整顿后，还有四百九十九个单位，另有四个属于国营范围的分别交中央和各专业系统管理。湖北省三百六十二个厂矿经过整顿后，二百八十六个划归省工业厅企业公司领导，有三十个单位分别交粮食局和合作社管理。
    湖南省在整顿工作中，首先着重批判了干部对发展地方工业的若干片面认识，使大家明确工业建设必须在中央统一领导下有计划地加以发展，才能使国家早日工业化。又批判了干部中新产生的“丢烂摊子”的思想，明确这次整顿正是为了今后稳步发展。同时特别强调了慎重处理编余职工的生活问题。湖南全省共编余职工六千余人，其中湘南三个专区即近五千人，除了由有关机关组成委员会负责处理外，中共湘南区党委副书记与各县县委书记都亲自掌握这个工作，帮助编余职工回乡生产，或转入准备扩大的厂矿中去。现在该省已大体处理完毕。
    经过整顿的单位，都积极建立与健全各种制度，改善经营管理，提高产量与质量，降低成本。湘南三个专区最近收到职工合理化建议一千二百件，生产上出现了很多新气象。原来生产很乱的胜利机械厂翻砂车间化铁炉由每小时出铁一千五百斤提高至二千五百斤，焦铁比重由一比五提高到一比七，废品率由百分之四十降至百分之十。湖南窑业公司所产火砖，每吨成本降低三分之一。湖北沙市电厂创造了一百天安全运转的新纪录。襄阳机械厂每个工人的生产价值提高了将近一倍。
    武汉市整顿完毕后，即转入改善经营管理。今年上半年全市地方工业的劳动生产率比去年同期提高了百分之七点六八，其生产总值因为生产扩大而增加了百分之四十五。该市地方工业今年第三季度以实行计划管理为中心，并初步建立责任制度，以求进一步提高产量、质量，降低成本，打开销路。
