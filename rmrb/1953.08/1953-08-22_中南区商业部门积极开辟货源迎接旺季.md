Commercial departments in the Central and South China region are actively seeking out sources of goods to meet the peak season.

State-owned commercial departments in the Central and South China region, based on the needs of the peak trading season after autumn, have studied and revised their sales plans for the third and fourth quarters, vigorously exploring sources of goods and actively developing supplies.

State-owned commercial departments in the Central and South China region had some errors and shortcomings in their work in the first half of this year, which led to imbalances in market supply and the serious undersupply of many commodities. In particular, the summer seasonal merchandise and fabrics were incomplete in color and design (mostly promoting white and blue cloth), which could not meet the needs of the masses and aroused public dissatisfaction. They criticized department stores as "shortage companies" and calico companies as "black and white companies." In response to the above situation, starting from June 17th, the Central and South China Commercial Administration convened meetings of the heads of commercial departments and bureaus in Hubei, Henan, Jiangxi, and Wuhan to review the work, re-revise the sales plans for the second half of the year for the six provinces and two cities (an initial increase of 15.61 percent for the entire region), and study and deploy the immediate expansion of processing orders and the development of sources of goods.

At present, commercial departments in various places have actively expanded the processing, ordering, and sales to local public and private factories. The proportion of orders placed by the Wuhan Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station to local private manufacturers, based on the needs of supply, has increased from 20 percent in the first half of the year to 40 percent. The Wuhan Calico Purchasing and Supply Station has increased the variety of products processed by small cloth factories in the third quarter from twelve in the second quarter to twenty-five, and has also assigned special personnel to study and test-weave the color varieties processed in the third quarter. First, the patterns of similar cotton cloths from southern Jiangsu, Guangzhou, and the Pearl River are analyzed and compared, and a variety of beautiful patterns are designed. These are then submitted to the sales departments to solicit opinions from salespeople and customers in order to select the most popular patterns for trial weaving in the cloth factory. After trial sales, the plan is revised and formally produced. More than 20 new-style printed cloth samples have now been test-woven and are constantly being added to. The Guangzhou Central Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station has expanded its purchases in the third quarter by 23 categories of goods compared to the first half of the year, and the number of orders and sales has also increased. In the orders, attention has also been paid to improving the quality of the work. State-owned commercial departments in Hubei, Henan, and Jiangxi have also significantly increased their purchases of local yarn, cloth, and general merchandise.

At the same time, in early August, the Central and South China Commercial Administration, together with various state-owned specialized companies and local industrial departments, under the leadership of the Central and South China Financial and Economic Committee, organized six working groups to go to Wuhan, Guangzhou, Nanning, Changsha, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, and other places to help commercial departments in various provinces and cities develop sources of goods, and to understand the production of products by local state-owned industrial departments, so as to solve the sales problems of future products and strengthen the production and sales relationship between local state-owned industry and state-owned commerce.

    中南区商业部门积极开辟货源迎接旺季
    中南区各国营商业部门根据秋后贸易旺季的需要，研究和修订了第三、四季度的销货计划，大力开辟货源，积极开展供应。
    中南区国营商业部门在今年上半年的工作中存在着一些错误和缺点，使市场供应失调，许多商品严重脱销。特别是夏季时令百货布匹花色不全（推销的多是白、蓝布），不能满足群众需要，引起群众不满。他们批评百货公司为“缺货公司”，花纱布公司为“黑白公司”。针对以上情况，六月十七日起，中南商业管理局分别召集了湖北、河南、江西、武汉等省市商业厅、局长开会，检查了工作，重新修订了六省二市下半年的销货计划（计全区初步增加百分之十五点六一），并研究和布置了立即展开扩大加工订货，开辟货源的工作。
    目前，各地商业部门已积极扩大了对当地公、私营工厂的加工、订货和包销。武汉市百货采购供应站根据供应情况的需要，向当地私营厂商加工订货的比重，由上半年的百分之二十增加为百分之四十。武汉市花纱布采购供应站第三季度对小型布厂加工的品种已由第二季度的十二种增加为二十五种，还指定专人对第三季度加工花色品种进行研究和试织工作。首先将苏南、广州、珠江等同品种棉布的花样进行分析比较，设计出多种美丽图案，交门市部征求营业员和顾客意见，以便选取最受欢迎的花样交织布厂试织，经试销后，再修正计划正式生产。现在试织的新式花布样已达二十余种，还在不断增加中。广州中央百货采购供应站第三季度的进货，已比上半年扩大了二十三类商品，订货包销数量也有增加，在订货中还注意了改进品质的工作。其他湖北、河南、江西国营商业部门，对当地的纱布及百货等的采购量都有了显著增加。
    与此同时，中南商业管理局于八月初和各国营专业公司，地方工业部门在中南财经委员会领导下组织了六个工作组，分别到武汉、广州、南宁、长沙、南昌、郑州等地，帮助各省、市商业部门开辟货源，并了解各地地方国营工业部门产品生产情况，以便解决今后产品的销路问题，密切地方国营工业与国营商业之间的产销关系。
