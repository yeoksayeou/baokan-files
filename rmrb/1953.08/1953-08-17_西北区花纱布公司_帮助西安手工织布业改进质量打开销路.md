The Northwest China Textile Company has helped the Xi'an hand weaving industry improve product quality, which has opened up sales channels, saved more than 3,000 hand textile workers in Xi'an from unemployment, and ensured the livelihoods of more than 30,000 family members. At the same time, it provided an outlet for cotton yarn from the Northwest, thereby meeting the needs of the people.

The hand weaving industry in Xi'an developed during the War of Resistance Against Japan when transportation was cut off. After liberation, due to the gradual improvement of people's lives and the increased demand for cloth, and because the machine textile industry could not meet market needs for a time, the hand weaving industry once became a necessary assistant to the machine textile industry. However, with the recovery and development of the national machine textile industry and transportation, the smooth flow of materials, coupled with the fact that the cost of hand weaving had not been reduced, the quality had not been improved, the product specifications were not standard, and the types were simple (only plain white cloth and plain striped cloth could be woven), sales were poor, and therefore the number of looms in operation gradually decreased.

In order to meet the needs of the people, the Northwest China Textile Company conducted a survey of the production and sales of yarn and cloth in the Northwest. The survey revealed that there was a shortage of cotton cloth in the Northwest, and some small dyeing factories were often shut down due to the lack of white cloth. At the same time, it was learned that various types of blue-grey twill fabrics were in great demand in the Northwest, especially popular in minority areas. Therefore, they studied how to help the hand weaving industry change product specifications where possible, changing plain weave to twill weave, to meet market needs. At that time, the hand weaving industry lacked confidence and had concerns about sales, believing that the technology of the hand weaving industry was not good, the equipment was too poor, and it would cost money to add equipment, etc. The Textile Company explained the benefits of changing to twill weaving, which cleared their minds, and after experimental weaving and dyeing, it proved to be effective, which increased their confidence. After further improvements, the twill fabric woven was comparable to the "Sheep" and "Frog" brand twill fabrics shipped from East China, thus reopening a path for the hand weaving industry, while also solving the problem of outlets for more than 20,000 bales of cotton yarn. It also met the annual demand of 600,000 bolts of blue-grey twill fabric in minority areas.

In 1952, in order to encourage the hand weaving industry to improve quality, the Northwest China Textile Company formulated a method of rewarding the reduction of substandard cloth rates in the industry. In the fourth quarter of 1952, 57 households received awards, paying out more than 57 million yuan in bonuses. Although the industry has continuously improved in terms of quality, it still could not keep up with the new demands of the rising living standards of the people. By the end of 1952, the people in the pastoral areas were no longer satisfied with "Sheep" brand grey-blue twill fabric, and sales gradually decreased. In order to adapt to the changes in people's lives, they again tried to improve quality, changing the original rough grey-blue twill dyed from 20x20 twill grey cloth to 23x21 fine twill grey cloth to dye various mercerized twill fabrics.

At present, the Northwest China Textile Company is preparing to further support and help the hand weaving industry continuously improve quality and reduce costs from production, under the principles of need, possibility, and consideration of both public and private interests, to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people.

### 西北区花纱布公司  帮助西安手工织布业改进质量打开销路

    西北区花纱布公司
    帮助西安手工织布业改进质量打开销路
    西北区花纱布公司，帮助西安市手工织布业改进产品质量后打开了销路，使西安市三千多手工纺织业工人免于失业，使三万多家属生活得到保障；同时使西北棉纱得到出路，从而满足了人民的需要。
    西安市手工织布业是在抗日战争时期交通断绝的情况下发展起来的。解放后由于人民生活逐步改善，布匹需要量增加，又因机器纺织业一时还不能满足市场需要，所以手工织布业一度曾经成了机器纺织业的必要助手。但是随着全国机器纺织业和交通事业的恢复和发展，物资畅流，加以手工织布业成本没有降低，质量没有提高，产品规格没有标准，种类单纯（只能织平纹白布和平纹条布两种），销路不好，因而开工布机便日益减少。
    西北区花纱布公司为了满足人民的需要，对西北纱布产销情况曾进行了调查。在调查中了解到西北区棉布不足，一些小染厂因没有白布经常停工，同时又了解到各种元青斜布在西北销量甚大，尤其在各少数民族地区很受欢迎。因此他们就研究帮助手工织布业在可能的条件下，改变产品规格，改平纹布为斜纹布，以适应市场需要。当时，手工织布业缺乏信心，对销路问题有顾虑，认为手工织布业技术不好、设备太差，增加装置需要花钱等等。花纱布公司向他们说明改织斜布的好处，打通了思想，并经试验织染，证明效果还好，这才增加了他们的信心。后来又经过若干改进后，织出来的斜布和华东地区运来的群羊、青蛙牌斜布比较不差上下，因此就给手工织布业重新打开了一条生路，同时也解决了两万多件棉纱的出路。又满足了少数民族地区每年六十万匹元斜布的需要。
    一九五二年西北区花纱布公司为了刺激手工织布业提高质量，特在该业中制订了减低次布率奖励办法。一九五二年第四季受奖者达五十七户，付出奖金五千七百多万元。虽然该业在质量方面不断有所改进，但毕竟还赶不上人民生活上升的新的要求，到一九五二年底牧区人民对于群羊元斜布已感到不够满意，销路逐渐缩减。为了适应人民生活的变化，他们又想办法提高质量，将原用二十乘二十斜纹坯布所染之本光粗元斜改为二十三乘二十一的细斜纹坯布以染制各色丝光斜布。
    目前西北区花纱布公司正准备进一步在需要、可能和公私兼顾的原则下，适当的支持和帮助手工织布业从生产中不断改进质量，降低成本，以满足广大人民的需要。    （白兴超）
