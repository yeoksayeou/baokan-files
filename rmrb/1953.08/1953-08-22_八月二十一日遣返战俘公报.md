Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 21st: On August 21st, our side repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war to the other side (all American), and 300 Korean prisoners of war, for a total of 450. As with the situation in the last three days, this number is about 50 more than the number stipulated in the agreement.

Among the Korean prisoners of war repatriated to the other side today was Lim Ik-chun, the deputy commander of the Rhee Syngman puppet army's Capital Division, who was the same person that American news agencies declared "missing" during our army's powerful counterattack south of Kimcheng in July.

Today, the other side still did not repatriate a single captured personnel from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    八月二十一日遣返战俘公报
    【新华社开城二十一日电】二十一日，我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百五十名（全是美国籍），朝鲜籍战俘三百名，总数为四百五十名。像最近三天来的情况一样，这个数字比协议规定的约数多五十名。
    在今日遣送给对方的朝鲜籍战俘中，有一名李承晚伪军首都师的副师长林益淳，他就是在七月份金城以南我军强大反击战中被美国通讯社宣布为“失踪”了的那一个人。
    今日对方仍然没有遣送一个朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员。
