Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Joint letter from the Propaganda Department of the Yantai Municipal Committee of the CPC, the Yantai Municipal People's Court, and the Yantai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau: We have seen the criticism published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column of the People's Daily on June 2nd, "The Yantai Municipal People's Court and the Public Security Bureau, etc., Should Not Ignore Yang Jianqiang's Report." After investigation by the Yantai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau regarding the issues reflected by Yang Jianqiang, it was found that they belong to internal religious issues and the situation is very complicated, so it cannot be dealt with immediately. However, the reason why this issue has been delayed for eight months without being resolved is, in addition to the above reasons, also because we did not pay enough attention to the letters from the people and had the simplistic view of relying solely on higher authorities for solutions. In addition, the handling of this issue also illustrates that there is insufficient communication between our judicial, public security, and other departments, leading to the phenomenon of mutual evasion of responsibility. Currently, we have a special working group dealing with this issue, and Yang Jianqiang has also participated in the meetings convened by the working group.

    中共烟台市委宣传部等对杨健强检举问题的答复
    中共烟台市委宣传部、烟台市人民法院和烟台市人民政府公安局联名来信：六月二日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏刊载的“烟台市人民法院和公安局等不应该不理杨健强的检举信”的批评，我们已经看到了。杨健强反映的问题，经烟台市人民政府公安局调查后，了解到是属于宗教内部的问题，并且情况十分复杂，不能立即处理。但这一问题之所以一直拖了八个月没有处理，除了上述原因外，还由于我们对人民来信重视不够，有着单纯依靠上级给办法的观点。另外，从这一问题的处理，还说明了我们司法、公安等部门的互相联系不够，以致有互相推脱责任的现象。现在，我们正由专门的工作小组在处理这一问题，杨健强也参加了工作组召开的会议。
