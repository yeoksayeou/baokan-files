Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 31st: TASS reports from Moscow on July 31st: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered the following note from the Soviet government regarding the question of concluding an Austrian State Treaty to the French Embassy in Moscow on July 30th of this year:

	"The Soviet Government has received the French Government's note of July 11th of this year regarding the question of concluding an Austrian State Treaty. The Soviet Government deems it necessary to make the following statement:

	As can be seen from the aforementioned note, the French government, as well as the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, still stubbornly adhere to the so-called 'Concise Treaty' draft they put forward on March 13, 1952. The Soviet Government has repeatedly pointed out that this draft does not conform to the Potsdam Conference decisions of the Four Powers regarding Austria, nor does it violate the agreements reached by the Foreign Ministers of France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union at the Paris Conference in June 1949 on important political and economic issues related to Austria. Therefore, it seriously infringes upon the interests of the Soviet Union and does not help to re-establish a truly independent and democratic Austrian state. This 'Concise Treaty' draft was drawn up by the governments of France, the United States, and the United Kingdom without the participation of the Soviet Union to replace the draft Austrian State Treaty, on which the Four Powers had already reached a basic agreement and which the Four Powers had jointly drafted according to the Four Powers' decisions on Austria. In its notes of August 14th and September 27th, 1952, and January 27th of this year, the Soviet Government expressed its willingness to complete the preparation of the Austrian State Treaty and considered it necessary to first determine whether the governments of France, the United States, and the United Kingdom were prepared to withdraw their proposal for the so-called 'Concise Treaty' for Austria. However, the Soviet Government has not yet received a response from the French Government or the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom regarding whether they are prepared to withdraw the 'Concise Treaty' draft.

	The withdrawal of the 'Concise Treaty' draft, which was formulated by the three countries without the participation of the Soviet Union—and which is intended to replace the draft Austrian State Treaty on which the Four Powers have already reached agreement on its main provisions—will enable the Four Powers to resume discussions on the Austrian State Treaty in order to reach an agreement on the outstanding issues concerning the conclusion of this treaty.

	The same note was also sent to the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom."

    就缔结对奥和约问题
    苏联政府照会法、美、英三国政府
    要求撤回“简要条约”草案重新讨论对奥和约
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七月三十一日讯：苏联外交部在今年七月三十日将苏联政府关于缔结对奥和约问题的下列照会送交莫斯科法国大使馆：
    “苏联政府收到了法国政府今年七月十一日关于缔结对奥和约问题的照会。苏联政府认为有必要作如下声明：
    从上述照会中可以看出，法国政府以及美国与英国政府仍然固执于他们在一九五二年三月十三日提出的所谓‘简要条约’草案。苏联政府曾经一再指出：这个草案不符合四大国波茨坦会议关于奥地利的决定，也违背了法、美、英、苏四国外长一九四九年六月在巴黎会议上就有关奥地利的重要的政治与经济问题所获得的协议，因此它严重地侵犯了苏联的权益，并且不能有助于重新建立一个真正独立的、民主的奥地利国家。这个‘简要条约’草案是法国、美国与英国政府在没有苏联参加的情况下草拟出来用以代替对奥和约草案的，对奥和约草案是四大国已经在基本上取得了协议的，并且是四大国根据四国关于奥地利的决定所共同拟就的。苏联政府在一九五二年八月十四日和九月二十七日的照会中以及今年一月二十七日的照会中曾表示它愿意完成对奥和约的准备工作，并认为有必要首先确定：法国、美国与英国政府是否准备撤回他们提出的所谓对奥‘简要条约’的建议。不过苏联政府还没有收到法国政府或是美国与英国政府关于他们是否准备撤回‘简要条约’草案的回答。
    撤回三国在没有苏联参加的情况下制订的‘简要条约’草案——它是用以代替四大国已经在其主要条款上取得协议的对奥和约草案的——将使四大国能够重新开始讨论对奥和约，以便在有关缔结这个和约的还没有解决的问题上达成协议。
    同样的照会也送交给了美国与英国政府。”
