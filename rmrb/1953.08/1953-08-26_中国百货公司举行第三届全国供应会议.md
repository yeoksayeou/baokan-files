    Before the arrival of the peak market season after autumn, the China General Merchandise Company convened more than 1,300 representatives from procurement and supply wholesale stations at all levels, provincial and municipal companies from various locations, and grassroots stores in key regions, in Shanghai for the Third National Supply Conference. The conference lasted for fifteen days and concluded on the 17th. This conference implemented the policy that, under the circumstances of large-scale economic construction already underway, state-owned commerce must expand commodity circulation, invigorate the urban and rural economy, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Based on this, it revised the plan to expand commodity circulation for the third and fourth quarters of this year.

    At the meeting, Deputy Manager Wang Zhang delivered a report, which reviewed the implementation of the plan in the first half of the year. He pointed out that, in the first half of this year, state-owned commerce generally exhibited a reluctance to operate freely and a one-sided compression of inventory due to insufficient understanding of the main responsibilities it should bear during the period of large-scale national economic construction. As a result, goods were out of stock, and the variety of goods decreased. Next, he demanded that various regions must strive to expand commodity circulation, expand the variety of goods, and strengthen the leadership of the market in the second half of the year. Guo Jian, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee, also delivered a report. After discussing the above reports, the representatives basically recognized the political and economic significance of doing a good job in supply work in the second half of the year.

    The meeting then entered the phase of business exchange. During the exchange, second-level wholesale stations in various regions supplemented the supply plan for the third quarter, formulated an expanded supply plan for the fourth quarter, and signed supply contracts with first-level stations. The exchange took note of the needs of the working people in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas for a wide variety of goods, and the needs of farmers for local industrial products and handicraft products. The exchange of local industrial products and handicraft products organized by the conference reached a total transaction value of more than 200 billion yuan. The exchange also paid attention to prioritizing the promotion of products from state-owned and local state-owned factories. As a result of the exchange, the problem of goods supply in various regions for the second half of the year has been basically resolved.

    In order to make the current business system more conducive to expanding commodity circulation, the conference organized six special issue groups to study contract terms, expense quotas, and profit deduction and payment systems, and drafted improvement plans.

    In addition, the conference also organized a series of symposiums. In addition to holding various commodity symposiums, in order to exchange experience in processing, ordering, and purchasing, and to understand and communicate the situation and relationship between stations and stores, a symposium of representatives from large cities and a symposium of all store representatives present were specially organized.

    At the end of the conference, Deputy Manager Huang Hongnian of the head office made a summary. After summarizing the achievements of the conference, he pointed out that it is entirely possible to do a good job in promotion work and complete the plan to expand commodity circulation in the second half of the year. The attention paid by the local CCP committees and people's governments, the increase in the purchasing power of urban and rural working people after autumn, the fact that the state has grasped 70% to 80% of the total production of daily-use industrial products in large cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, and the preliminary revision of business systems that hinder the expansion of commodity circulation are all favorable conditions for completing the task. He demanded that various regions make full use of these favorable conditions and mobilize employees to boldly expand promotion.

    The summary report required that the following issues be paid attention to in future work in various regions: First, the principle of wholesale as the main focus must be implemented in promoting goods. Second, it is necessary to use greater material strength to cooperate with the grain company and other departments in rural procurement. Third, it is necessary to further organize sources of goods and strengthen the processing, ordering, and purchasing of local industrial products and handicraft products, and focus on promoting products from state-owned and local state-owned factories. Fourth, it is necessary to maintain close contact with cooperatives and give them assistance and preferential treatment. Fifth, the expansion of the purchase and sale of a wide variety of goods should be handled according to different regions and different situations to avoid blind phenomena; for farmers, the main supply target, the main focus should be on supplying inexpensive and good-quality industrial products.

    Since the peak market season has begun to arrive, Huang Hongnian demanded that first-level stations must use fast purchasing, fast transfer, and fast transportation methods to quickly send goods to second-level stations. Second-level stations must maintain close contact with first-level stations and third-level stores, keep abreast of store sales at all times, and do a good job in serving stores. Third-level stores must resolutely and vigorously promote sales, and make the greatest effort to do a good job in market supply, in order to cooperate with the grain company and other departments in投放 work in rural areas. He pointed out that in the peak sales season, urban industrial products must quickly flow to consumers through first-level stations, second-level stations, and third-level stores, and any practice that violates this requirement is wrong.

    中国百货公司举行第三届全国供应会议
    秋后市场旺季到来之前，中国百货公司召集各级采购供应批发站、各地省市公司和重点地区基层商店的代表一千三百多人，在上海举行了第三届全国供应会议。会议进行了十五天，已在十七日结束。这次会议贯彻了在大规模经济建设已经开始的情形下，国营商业必须扩大商品流转、活跃城乡经济、巩固工农联盟的方针，并在此基础上修订了今年第三、四季度扩大商品流通计划。
    会上王章副经理作了报告，报告检查了上半年执行计划的情况。他指出，今年上半年国营商业因对国家大规模经济建设期间所应负的主要责任认识不足，各地普遍出现不敢放手经营和片面压缩库存的现象，结果商品脱销，花色品种减少。接着，他要求各地在下半年必须努力扩大商品流转，扩大经营品种，加强对市场的领导。上海市人民政府财政经济委员会郭建副主任也作了报告。代表们讨论了上述报告后，基本上认清了做好下半年供应工作的政治意义和经济意义。
    接着，会议进入业务交流。各地二级批发站在交流中都补充了第三季度供应计划，制订了第四季度扩大供应计划，并和一级站签订了供应合同。在交流中注意到大、中城市和工矿区劳动人民对多种多样商品的需要和农民对地方工业品、手工业品的需要。会议组织的地方工业品和手工业品的交流，成交总值达两千多亿元。在交流中也注意优先推销国营和地方国营工厂的产品。交流的结果，已基本上解决了各地下半年的货源供应问题。
    为了使现行业务制度更有利于扩大商品流转，会议组织了六个专门问题小组，研究合同条件、费用定额和利润扣交制度等问题，并作出了改进的草案。
    此外，会议还组织了一系列的座谈会。除召开各种不同的商品座谈会外，为了交流加工、定货和收购的经验，了解和沟通站、店之间的情况和关系，特别组织了大城市代表座谈会和全体到会商店代表座谈会。
    会议最后由总公司黄洪年副经理作总结。他总结了大会的成就后指出，下半年作好推销工作，完成扩大商品流转计划，是完全可以做到的。各地中共党委和人民政府的重视，秋后城乡劳动人民购买力的提高，上海、天津、广州等大城市日用工业品总生产量的百分之七、八十已为国家掌握，有碍扩大商品流通的业务制度已初步修改等都是完成任务的有利条件。他要求各地充分利用这些有利条件，发动职工放手展开推销。
    总结报告要求各地在今后的工作中注意以下的问题：一、推销商品必须贯彻以批发为主的方针。二、必须运用较大的物质力量配合粮食公司等部门在农村的收购。三、要进一步组织货源，加强对当地工业品和手工业品的加工、定货和收购，对国营及地方国营工厂的产品更应着重推销。四、必须密切联系合作社，给予帮助和优待。五、扩大多种多样的商品购销要按不同地区和不同情况办理，避免发生盲目现象；对主要供应对象农民，主要应供应价廉物美的工业品。
    由于市场旺季已开始到来，黄洪年要求一级站必须用快购、快调和快运办法，把商品迅速送到二级站去。二级站要密切联系一级站和三级商店、要随时了解商店的销售情况，做好对商店的服务工作。三级商店要坚决大力推销，要用最大努力做好市场供应，以配合粮食公司等部门对农村的投放工作。他指出：在商品旺销季节，必须使城市工业品迅速通过一级站、二级站、三级商店流到消费者手里，任何违反这一要求的做法都是错误的。
