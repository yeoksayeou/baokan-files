An introduction to the Sanhe Sluice Gate Project, the largest sluice gate on the Huai River

The Sanhe Sluice Gate project, located downstream of the Huai River and controlling Hongze Lake, was successfully completed on July 25th. A water release ceremony was held on July 26th.

Hongze Lake covers an area of 2,500 square kilometers. Over the years, the maximum flow of the Huai River's upper and middle reaches into Hongze Lake has reached more than 18,000 cubic meters per second, while the waterway into the Yangtze River can only discharge 8,000 cubic meters per second. The excess floodwaters would overflow, inundating the northern Jiangsu Plain. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, a 140-li long Honghu Dam was built, further expanding Hongze Lake. The canal embankments were also built higher and higher. In order to resist the floods from Gaoyou and Baoying Lakes, five "Returning Sea Dams" were built on the eastern bank of the canal, hundreds of kilometers from the sea, to "release water into the sea" when floods arrived. From 1860 to 1938, the dam was opened fourteen times. In 1931, when the "Returning Sea Dam" was opened, the dyke also breached in twenty-six places. Near the Gaoyou city watchtower alone, more than 2,000 people drowned, and more than 10 million mu of farmland in northern Jiangsu were submerged. The Kuomintang reactionaries chanted "Guiding the Huai River" from 1931 until their collapse, but only built a few ship locks on the canal. For many years, the people of northern Jiangsu suffered deeply. After liberation, Chairman Mao made the determination: "We must harness the Huai River well." The Sanhe Sluice Gate project was started on October 1, 1952, under the guidance of the central government's "storage and discharge combined" policy for harnessing the Huai River. A total of 150,000 employees participated in the project. After nearly ten months of intense construction, it has now been successfully completed.

The Sanhe Sluice Gate is the largest sluice gate built in the Huai River harnessing project. It is located on the southeastern shore of Hongze Lake in Huaiyin County, northern Jiangsu. The gate body is 697.75 meters long and 9.5 meters high, with a total of 63 openings, all made of reinforced concrete. The total workload of the Sanhe Sluice Gate project includes the excavation of 7.5 million cubic meters of earth for the new river channel, the closure of the old river channel, the pouring of 55,000 cubic meters of concrete, and the chiseling and masonry of 47,000 cubic meters of stone. All the materials required for the project came from all over the country, totaling 300,000 tons.

The Sanhe Sluice Gate project applied advanced Soviet experience in many aspects of construction. The adoption of the Soviet construction method of building dams without foundation piles not only saved 12% of the project cost but also greatly shortened the construction time. During the construction period, Soviet water conservancy expert Bukov came to the site to help solve important problems in the project. Last winter, when the temperature dropped to minus 8 degrees Celsius, the workers learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet "winter operation method," allowing the concrete pouring project to continue as usual. In the erection of formwork, tying of steel bars, and pouring of concrete, young technicians and workers closely combined and widely promoted the "assembly line operation method," which increased work efficiency by one to four times.

Thanks to the leadership, organization, and mobilization of the masses by the Party and the construction site headquarters, and the launch of the struggle against bureaucracy during the construction period, the labor enthusiasm and creativity of all employees were greatly enhanced, overcoming the difficulties of the narrow construction site and the tight schedule. For example, the project headquarters adopted the method of "teaching, learning, and doing at the same time," enabling the People's Liberation Army soldiers and more than 700 farmers participating in the project to quickly master the technology and accelerate the progress of the project. In order to catch up with the flood, all employees launched a vigorous patriotic labor competition to harness the Huai River, constantly thinking of ways and finding tricks, and put forward many rationalization proposals, resulting in continuous new creations and new records. According to preliminary statistics, more than 10,000 model workers and model units emerged throughout the construction site, including more than 180 special-class and first-class model workers.

After the completion of the Sanhe Sluice Gate, it will control the overflow of floods with its restriction of 8,000 cubic meters per second, and store the excess floodwaters in Hongze Lake, making Hongze Lake a natural reservoir, thus eliminating the disaster for the people of northern Jiangsu. At the same time, the Sanhe Sluice Gate, together with the completed northern Jiangsu irrigation main canal and other projects under construction, will constitute a large-scale irrigation system, which can irrigate 25 million mu of farmland in northern Jiangsu. After irrigation, the farmland in northern Jiangsu can increase grain production by 1 million tons per year. In terms of shipping, the Sanhe Sluice Gate also plays a huge role in regulating flow.

    淮河最大水闸三河闸工程介绍
    淮河下游控制洪泽湖的三河闸工程，已于七月二十五日胜利完工。并在七月二十六日举行了放水典礼。
    洪泽湖面积二千五百平方公里，历年来，淮河上中游注入洪泽湖的最大流量达一万八千多秒公方，而入江水道只能泄出八千秒公方，宣泄不及的洪水泛滥开来，便淹没了苏北平原。明、清两朝修筑了长达一百四十里的洪湖大堤，使洪泽湖更加扩大，运河堤岸也相对地愈修愈高，为了抗拒高邮、宝应等湖的洪水，他们又在运河东堤上建造了五个距海还有几百公里的“归海坝”，一旦洪水到来，便“放水入海”。从一八六零年到一九三八年，计开坝十四次。一九三一年开了“归海坝”，这堤还决口二十六处；仅高邮城挡军楼附近就淹死二千多人，苏北地区一千多万亩农田全被淹没。国民党反动派自一九三一年起就高唱“导淮”，直到崩溃前夕，只是在运河上修了几个船闸。多年来，苏北人民蒙受了深重的灾难。解放后，毛主席下定决心：“一定要把淮河修好”。三河闸工程便在中央“蓄泄兼筹”的治淮方针和计划指导下，于一九五二年十月一日开工。先后参加工程的员工有十五万人，经过近十个月的紧张施工，现已胜利完工。
    三河闸是治淮工程中修建的最大的一个水闸，在苏北淮阴县境洪泽湖的东南岸，闸身长六百九十七点七五公尺，高九点五公尺，共六十三孔，全部是钢筋混凝土筑成。三河闸的全部工程量，包括七百五十万土方的新河道开挖和旧河道堵闭工程，五万五千公方的混凝土浇筑工程，四万七千石方的凿砌工程。工程所需的全部器材来自全国各地的，足有三十万吨。
    三河闸工程在施工中多方面运用了苏联先进经验。由于采用苏联建闸不打基桩的施工方法，不仅工程费用节省了百分之十二，施工时间也大为缩短。施工期中，苏联水利专家布可夫曾到工地帮助解决了工程中的重要问题。去年冬季，气温下降到摄氏零下八度，工人们学习苏联“冬季作业法”的先进经验，使浇筑混凝土工程照常进行。在立模板、扎钢筋和浇混凝土工程中，青年技术人员和工人紧密结合，普遍推行“流水作业法”，使工作效率提高了一倍到四倍。
    由于党和工地指挥部的领导，组织和发动了群众，并在施工期间展开了反官僚主义的斗争，大大发挥了全体员工的劳动积极性和创造性，克服了工地狭小、时间紧迫的困难。如工程指挥部曾经采取“边教、边学、边做”的方法，使参加这项工程的人民解放军战士和七百多农民，能够很快地掌握技术，加速了工程的进度。为了赶到洪水前面去，全体员工又开展了热火朝天的爱国治淮劳动竞赛运动，不断地想办法、找窍门，提出了许多合理化建议，连续出现新的创造和新纪录。据初步统计，整个工地就涌现了一万多个模范和模范单位，其中特等模范和一等模范有一百八十多人。
    三河闸完成后，它将以其八千秒公方的限制量控制洪水的漫流，把过量的洪水拦蓄在洪泽湖里，使洪泽湖成为一个天然水库，这样就可以免除苏北人民的灾难。同时，三河闸配合治淮中已完成的苏北灌溉总渠等工程及其他待做工程，将构成一个大规模的灌溉系统，可灌溉苏北地区二千五百万亩农田。苏北农田经灌溉后，每年可增产粮食一百万吨。在航运方面，三河闸也起着巨大的调节流量作用。
