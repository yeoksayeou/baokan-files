    Investigation Report on Close Planting of Wheat in Shijiazhuang Area, Hebei Province
    Zhao XingSan, Chen Qihua, Li Keming, Li Yafu
    I. Basic Situation of Promoting Close Planting of Wheat

    According to statistics from the Shijiazhuang Special Commissioner's Office and the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Government: a total of 120,000 mu of wheat was closely planted in the entire special zone, accounting for 3% of all wheat fields; 3,200 mu of wheat was closely planted in the suburban area of Shijiazhuang City, accounting for 5.3% of all wheat fields. In promoting close planting of wheat, some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams with a relatively solid foundation played a leading role. Individual farmers also practiced close planting, but mostly on small plots of land for experimentation. We visited two farms and eight villages in the fifth district of the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City, Gaocheng County, and Hengshui County (including four agricultural cooperatives, five mutual aid teams, and three farmers). The closely planted wheat in these areas and units, with proper fertilization, irrigation, and cultivation conditions, yielded 30% to 50% more than wheat planted using old cultivation methods. For example, the 42.5 mu of closely planted wheat in the Xu Sizeng Agricultural Cooperative yielded an average of 477 jin per mu, exceeding the cooperative's average yield of 303 jin per mu last year by 57%, and exceeding the average yield of 337.5 jin per mu for the entire Fan Village this year by 41.3%. The closely planted wheat of the Zheng Xiaodong Mutual Aid Team yielded 210 jin per mu, exceeding the yield of 150 jin per mu for the large-furrow wheat by 40%. Due to the initial planting, many people still had shortcomings in mastering close planting techniques, such as excessive fertilization, improper watering resulting in lodging or late maturity; small seeding rates; missing seedlings in rows; and impure varieties, which reduced the effectiveness of the yield increase; otherwise, the yield could have been even higher. We had more than ten conversations and visits with cadres at all levels, agricultural technicians, and some farmers, and the unanimous opinion was that the wheat close planting experiments in the Shijiazhuang area were successful. The success of close planting of wheat in this area eliminated many doubts and concerns among farmers about the advanced experience of wheat close planting. Li Lao Jing, the most conservative-minded person in Fan Village, originally firmly opposed this "foreign-style" new method, but after competing with the Xu Sizeng Agricultural Cooperative in close planting using the old method of "planting large furrows," he admitted his defeat. Because under almost the same land and irrigation conditions, and with an additional 2,000 jin of manure per mu, his wheat yielded only 307 jin per mu, which was 170 jin less than the closely planted wheat of the Xu Sizeng Cooperative. Educated by this fact, Li Lao Jing took the initiative to learn from Xu Sizeng and planned to switch to close planting of wheat this autumn.

    II. Experience in Close Planting of Wheat

    (1) Methods and Effects of Close Planting

    The close planting methods in this area can be summarized into the following four types: 1. Double-seeding method: This involves using a seed drill to sow as usual, and then sowing again in the middle of the wheat furrows, doubling the number of rows. Most of the closely planted wheat we saw was using this method. 2. Adjacent-row method: One method is to use a seed drill to sow as usual, and then sow again closely adjacent to the already sown wheat furrows; another method is to use a double-footed seed drill to sow in one go, only reducing the row spacing between the two seed drills to two or three inches. Usually, the former is called inner-adjacent, and the latter is called outer-adjacent. After the wheat seedlings grow, the two adjacent furrows merge into one. Therefore, the actual effect of the adjacent-row method is to widen the sowing width. 3. Cross-seeding method: The Hengshui County Farm used a seed drill with an 18-inch row spacing to double-sow (row spacing combined to 6 inches), and then cross-sow once (row spacing combined to 9 inches), planting in a rectangular pattern. The cross-seeding method of the Hebei Province Farm is a square pattern with a row spacing of 4.5 inches. 4. Hole-seeding method: Only the Hengshui County Farm used this method. The method is to use a hoe to open ditches and manually sow seeds, with a row spacing and sowing width of 6 inches.

    From the perspective of the effect, the Xu Sizeng Cooperative conducted a comparison under conditions of land preparation and fertilization, and the results showed that the yield of double-seeded wheat was higher. Zhang Huazi of Xinfeng Village in Gaocheng County compared adjacent-row seeding with large-furrow seeding on one piece of land, and the yield of adjacent-row seeding was also higher than that of large-furrow seeding. We studied and compared the various methods we saw, and all showed that adjacent-row seeding was better than the original large-furrow seeding, and double-seeding was better than adjacent-row seeding. This is because although the seeding surface of the adjacent-row method is larger than the old method, it is not as effective as the double-seeding method in distributing the seeds more sparsely and evenly. The more sparsely and evenly the seeds are distributed, the larger the nutrient area for a single plant, and the more evenly the plants can develop, resulting in a high effective tillering rate, a large number of effective spikes per unit area, and uniform spike heads, resulting in a high yield. Through this fact, we further clarified that the complete concept of wheat close planting must be combined with the condition of "sparse sowing." Some people call close planting "narrow furrow sparse planting," which has a certain truth.

    Secondly, the double-seeding method is easier to master technically than the adjacent-row method. The distance between the two furrows in the adjacent-row method is very close. When sowing the second furrow, the phenomenon of the two furrows being far apart or overlapping will occur if encountering clods of earth or livestock taking a detour. The double-seeding method does not have this shortcoming. Although the soil turned up when sowing the second furrow in the double-seeding method is easy to bury in the already sown furrow, resulting in uneven soil covering depth and a phenomenon of more seedlings in one row and fewer seedlings in another row, some people have overcome this shortcoming. For example, the Xu Sizeng Cooperative used a method of sowing the second furrow two or three inches deeper than the first furrow, and the Hu Yanyu Cooperative used a method of rolling and leveling after sowing, which largely achieved a consistent soil covering depth. In their wheat fields, there is rarely a phenomenon of more seedlings in one row and fewer seedlings in another row.

    The cross-seeding method inevitably tramples on neighboring land during cross-sowing, and also picks up the previously sown seeds, resulting in uneven density of wheat seedlings. This phenomenon is very serious in the cross-sown wheat fields of the Hebei Province Farm and the Hengshui County Farm. This sowing method is not suitable for promotion under current farming conditions.

    The hole-seeding method was only seen at the Hengshui County Farm. Although this method has the advantage of fewer missing seedlings, the sowing efficiency is low, and the yield increase effect is not as good as the double-seeding method.

    (2) Seeding Rate of Close Planting

    This year, the seeding rate of the Xu Sizeng Cooperative increased from 10 jin to 17 jin per mu. Based on the growth situation, they believe that it can be increased to 20 jin. The Hu Yanyu Cooperative has already increased from 12 jin to 20 jin. The seeding rate of the Hengshui County Farm's dry land increased from the original 6-7 jin to 13.5 jin per mu. Zhou Shiying of Dashanzhang Village sowed 9 jin per mu of dry land, which is higher than the seeding rate of ordinary people.

    In short, it is certain that the seeding rate needs to be increased after reducing the row spacing, but the original foundation and other conditions should be taken into account, and the increase or decrease should be properly controlled. For example, if the land preparation is good, the sowing is early, and the variety is small-grained, the seeding rate can be reduced; otherwise, it should be increased.

    (3) On Cultivation Techniques

    Close planting of wheat must be combined with comprehensive cultivation techniques to maximize its effectiveness. We encountered many such facts during the investigation. In terms of tillage, for example, the land preparation of the Xu Sizeng Cooperative is relatively reasonable. After the previous crop is harvested, the cooperative shallow plows to destroy the stubble and then deep plows, which is conducive to weathering the soil and restoring soil fertility. The second deep plowing is carried out ten days before sowing, during which pre-sowing irrigation is carried out. This not only promotes the decomposition of fertilizers in the soil, but also avoids the drawbacks of soil subsidence after sowing.

    In terms of irrigation, the same Shite No. 14 variety was fertilized more by the Hengshui County Farm than by the Xu Sizeng Cooperative by one-half, and the wheat seedlings were irrigated once more after returning to green in early spring, but the wheat growth was not as good as that of the Xu Sizeng Cooperative. The main reason was that the soil had cracked when the Hengshui County Farm irrigated the first water, and the ground was dry to a depth of six or seven inches when irrigating the fourth water, so the wheat ears had dry tips and the yield was affected. When the Wuxiangyuan Cooperative of Xing'an Village in Gaocheng irrigated the fifth water on June 4, the wheat ears had turned yellow. After watering, they encountered wind, resulting in lodging and late maturity by three or four days. It can be seen that irrigation must be based on the soil moisture conditions and should be appropriately controlled according to the climate and variety characteristics, and the specified number of times cannot be mechanically executed. In terms of spring harrowing, the Sun Gang Cooperative of Beishanzhang Village in Hengshui County unintentionally conducted a comparative experiment between empty harrowing and heavy harrowing, and the wheat growth was obviously different. They carried out the so-called "top-thawing harrowing" when it began to thaw. Because of lack of experience, they only pulled empty harrows, only drawing some lines on the ground. Finally, they tried human-powered heavy harrowing on a piece of land, raking up all the withered grass and rotten leaves, and loosening the topsoil. At that time, they suspected that the harrowing was bad, but after the wheat seedlings jointed, they grew well. This is because harrowing away withered grass and rotten leaves facilitates wheat growth, and more importantly, it loosens the topsoil, circulates air, and cuts off the evaporation of capillary tubes, especially when carried out at the beginning of thawing, which can fully retain moisture. Their well water was insufficient, and the wheat field was only irrigated once, which was essentially dry land, so the effect of spring harrowing to preserve moisture was even more obvious. In terms of variety selection, for example, the seeds used by the Xu Sizeng Cooperative were the excellent variety supplied by the Hebei Province Farm - Shite No. 14, with a seed purity of more than 95%. The farm's technical cadres also helped with salt water selection, resulting in uniform growth, large ears, and strong stalks. However, the local Youzi wheat in Gaocheng has the characteristics of being resistant to fertilizer and water, having strong stalks that are not easy to lodge, early maturity, and high yield, but when it was exchanged through the grain depot last year, it was mixed with as many as four or five other varieties, resulting in uneven height and inconsistent maturity. In addition, if pest and disease control is done well, damage can be reduced; conversely, diseased plants and missing seedlings will be caused, affecting the effect of close planting.

    III. What Problems Were Solved by the Success of Wheat Close Planting in the Shijiazhuang Area?

    (1) Does close planting cause lodging?

    1. Wide furrows lodge more than narrow furrow close planting. For example, the wheat planted by Wu Mengchen in Xing'an Village, Gaocheng County, has two types: wide furrows and narrow furrows. The management and fertilization of the two types of wheat are the same. After the rain on April 30, the lodging area of wide furrows was 5%, while the lodging area of narrow furrow close planting was only 2%. According to the lodging situation of the Hebei Province Farm in Shijiazhuang City on May 3, the lodging area of large furrows with a seeding rate of 260,000 grains per mu accounted for 83.7% of the total area, while the lodging area of narrow furrows with a seeding rate of 310,000 grains per mu accounted for only 27.5% of the total area.

    2. Excessive soil fertility or improper fertilizer combination causes more lodging. For example, the lodging wheat in the Xu Sizeng Cooperative was all in vegetable garden land, because this type of garden land is fertile, especially with more nitrogen fertilizer. The same seeding rate does not cause lodging in ordinary land. The soil of Malokui's fertile water-logged closely planted wheat in Jiacun, Gaocheng is coarse sandy loam, and the land is relatively thin. 6,000 jin of manure, 100 jin of cottonseed cake, and 120 jin of black beans were applied per mu as base fertilizer, and there was no lodging.

    3. Improper irrigation causes more lodging. For example, the Wuxiangyuan Cooperative of Xing'an Village, Gaocheng County, did not look at the weather when irrigating, and irrigated the fifth water when the wheat was already filling and turning yellow, the grains were heavy, and the wind was about to blow, causing lodging. This proves that too much water will cause lodging.

    4. Lodging resistance of varieties. According to the test results of various farms, varieties such as Yulinbai, Dingxian No. 72, and Huanong No. 5 have weak stalks and are prone to lodging. Varieties such as Nangong Dabai, Pingyuan No. 50, Youzi Wheat, and Shite No. 14 have short, upright stalks and are not prone to lodging. On the Hengshui Farm, the same water-logged closely planted wheat, the wheat field planted with Shite No. 14 did not lodge, while the wheat field planted with Yulinbai lodged.

    These facts show that cultivation techniques, fertilizer, irrigation, and varieties are closely related to wheat lodging, and that close planting does not cause lodging. After visiting the closely planted wheat fields, the farmers in Fancun all believed that close planting and sparse sowing also have a mutual support effect.

    (2) Does close planting require large amounts of manure and frequent irrigation?

    Blindly applying too much fertilizer, irrigating too frequently, and not applying manure or irrigating are equally bad. The fertile water-logged closely planted wheat of Wuxiangyuan Cooperative has a seeding rate of 20 jin, a row spacing of 5 inches, and applies 7,000 jin of straw circle manure, 100 jin of bean cake, 100 jin of small sesame cake, and 100 jin of peanut kernel cake, and irrigates five times. On June 7, the stems and leaves were dark green, with two large areas of lodging, and maturity was delayed by three or four days. At the experience exchange meeting on close planting of wheat in the village, everyone agreed that although the high-yield closely planted wheat of the cooperative was good, too much nitrogen fertilizer was wasted, and watering when the wind was blowing caused large areas of lodging. The same situation occurred with Xu Lanzhen's water-logged wheat in Fancun, Fifth District of Shijiazhuang City. His four-fen wheat field applied eight carts (about 12,000 jin) of circle manure, and all lodged during the filling period. According to the investigation results of the Hebei Province Farm, both barren land and over-fertile land are not good for the growth of closely planted wheat.

    (3) Can dry land be closely planted?

    Close planting of wheat is not only successful in water-logged land, but also successful in dry land. For example, the closely planted wheat of Zhou Shiying in Dashanzhang Village, Hengshui County (row spacing of 8 inches, using 9 jin of Hulutou seeds per mu) yielded 157 jin, while the sparsely planted wheat of Li Runzhi, a neighbor (row spacing of 1.25 feet, sowing more than 6 jin per mu), yielded an average of 90 jin per mu and matured five or six days later. The natural conditions of the two are the same (both are dry land), and no fertilizer was applied, but the harvests are very different.

    (4) Can close planting be intercropped?

    In the Shijiazhuang area, there is a habit of intercropping late millet, planting beans, or planting yams (sweet potatoes) between wheat furrows before the wheat harvest. They felt that the space between the furrows was too narrow to intercrop. They can only pull out the wheat stubble to carry out summer planting. If it is dry, they can only cut, and the remaining wheat stubble will prevent the intercropped crops from being sown. The adjacent-row method can be used to intercrop other crops. At the same time, choosing early-maturing varieties, such as Youzi wheat, is also conducive to intercropping.

    IV. Opinions on Promoting Close Planting of Wheat in the Future

    1. The agricultural cooperatives or mutual aid teams we contacted all have different amounts of closely planted wheat for various comparative experiments. The vivid facts educated the farmers. Anyone who personally saw the success of close planting plans to conduct close planting experiments personally when planting wheat this autumn. This fact that the masses cautiously accept new things reflects the correctness of the policy of steady development. Spreading from the successful teams, cooperatives, and villages this year, establishing more demonstration points, and gradually promoting it year by year will surely achieve good results.

    2. The serious problem lies in fighting against conservative ideas. Close planting has been successful, but various resistance emotions will inevitably be encountered at the beginning of its implementation. For example, the Xu Sizeng Cooperative originally planned to use 20 jin of seeds per mu, but the head of the sowing team disagreed and secretly blocked the seed leakage holes, reducing the seeds sown per mu by 3 jin to more than 6 jin. Kong Huazi's two mu of closely planted wheat in Tazhong Village, Fifth District of Shijiazhuang City, was too labor-intensive during the harvest (eleven people pulled for an afternoon, mainly because the wheat pullers were too tired from pulling wheat for several days and the ground was hardened and dry, thus reducing efficiency), causing Kong Huazi to mistakenly believe that close planting is labor-intensive. He said: If the yield is not increased much, it is not enough for wages, and it is not as beneficial as large-furrow sparse planting. Therefore, solving ideological problems should always be emphasized when promoting close planting.

    3. Strengthen technical guidance and promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in improving technology. From the perspective of Fancun, Maozhuang, Xing'an and other villages, the success of wheat close planting is inseparable from the specific guidance of farms or technology promotion stations. This experience should be vigorously promoted in the future. In addition, we learned that the phenomenon of broken rows, broken strips, and missing seedlings in most closely planted wheat fields is still very common, so it is very necessary to continue to strengthen technical guidance. The masses in the areas where close planting of wheat is carried out are very enthusiastic about improving technology. For example, the Xu Sizeng Cooperative is already studying and creating a seed drill suitable for close planting. This enthusiasm and creativity should continue to be promoted.

    河北省石家庄地区小麦密植情况的调查报告
    赵星三  陈启华  李克明  李亚夫
    一、推行小麦密植的基本情况
    据石家庄专署及石家庄市人民政府农林局统计：全专区共密植小麦十二万亩，占全部麦田的百分之三；石家庄市郊区共密植小麦三千二百亩，占全部麦田的百分之五点三。在推广小麦密植中，一些比较有基础的农业生产合作社和互助组都起了带头作用，单干农民中也有个别实行密植的，但多是在小块土地上作试验。我们先后到过两个农场和石家庄市郊区第五区、藁城县、衡水县等地的八个村（包括四个农业社、五个互助组、三个农户）。这些地区和单位的密植小麦，在适当的施肥、浇水、耕作等条件配合下，较旧耕作法种植的小麦增产百分之三十至五十以上。如许思曾农业社的四十二亩五分密植小麦，每亩平均实收四百七十七斤，超过该社去年每亩实收三百零三斤的百分之五十七，超过范村全村今年每亩平均产量三百三十七斤半的百分之四十一点三。郑小冬互助组的密植麦实收二百一十斤，超过大垅麦每亩实收一百五十斤的百分之四十。由于初种，很多人在掌握密植技术上还有缺点如施肥过多、浇水不当而造成倒伏或晚熟；播种量小；断垅缺苗；品种不纯等，以致降低增产成效，不然产量还可能再高些。我们跟各级干部、农业技术人员以及一些农民作过十几次交谈和访问，大家一致的意见是：在石家庄地区试验的小麦密植是成功的。这个区域推行密植小麦成功的事实，扫除了农民对小麦密植先进经验的许多怀疑和顾虑。范村思想最保守的李老景，原来是坚决反对这“洋洋气气”的新法子的一个人，可是在他用“种大垅”的老法子跟许思曾农业社密植竞赛的结果，他承认自己失败了。因为在土地、浇水条件差不多，并且每亩还多施二千斤圈肥的情况下，结果他的小麦每亩只收三百零七斤，比许思曾社的密植麦每亩少收一百七十斤。李老景在这一事实的教育下，就主动地向许思曾学习，准备今年秋后也改种密植麦。
    二、小麦密植的经验
    （一）密植的方法和效果
    这个地区小麦密植播种方法综合有以下四种：一、套耧法：是用耧按原来的方法耩完后，在麦垅中间再耩一次，使行数增加一倍。我们所看到的密植麦，大部分是采用此法。二、靠耧并垅法：一种是用耧按原来的方法耩完后，紧靠已耩的麦垅再耩一次；另一种是用双脚耧一次种完，仅把两耧之间的行距缩小到两三寸，通常前者称里靠，后者称外靠。麦苗长大后，靠近的两垅即并成一垅，因此，靠耧并垅法的实际作用是加宽播幅。三、交叉法：衡水县农场用一尺八寸行距的耧，顺着套两耧（行距合六寸），再横着套一耧（行距合九寸），种成长方形，河北省农场的交叉法是行距四寸半的正方形。四、窝麦法：采用此法的只衡水县农场，方法是用镐开沟，手撒籽，行距播幅都是六寸宽。
    从效果上看，许思曾社曾在整地、施肥条件下进行比较，结果是套耧麦的产量高。藁城县辛奉村张化子，在一块地上，用靠耧和大垅进行比较，靠耧的又比大垅的产量高。我们研究了所见到的各种方法加以对比，都是靠耧比原来大垅好，套耧又比靠耧好。因为靠耧法虽比旧法的种籽撒布面增大了，但不如套耧法能把种籽撒布得更为疏散均匀。种籽撒布越是疏散均匀，单株营养面积就越大，植株也越能平均发育，因而有效分蘖率大，单位面积有效穗数多，穗头整齐一致，产量高。通过这一事实我们进一步明确地认识了小麦密植必须加上“疏播”条件方能构成完整的概念，有的群众称密植为“窄垅稀植”是有一定道理的。
    其次，在技术上套耧法也比靠耧法容易掌握，靠耧的两垅距离很近，在耩第二耧时一遇到土圪垃或牲口走弯路，都会发生两垅远离或重叠在一起的现象。套耧法则无此缺点。虽然套耧法在耩第二耧时翻起的土容易埋到已耩过的垅沟中，造成覆土深浅不一，一行苗多一行苗少的现象，但这种缺点有的群众已经克服了。如许思曾社用第二耧比第一耧深耩二、三分的方法，胡雁雨社用砘后?平的方法，都大体上做到了覆土深浅一致，他们的麦地里，很少有一垅苗多一垅苗少的现象。
    交叉法既在横耩时难免践踏邻地，同时也会挑起先播的种籽，造成麦苗稠稀不匀现象，在河北省农场和衡水县农场的交叉播种的麦地中，这种现象都很严重。在现时耕作条件下这种播法不宜推广。
    窝麦法仅在衡水县农场看到。这种方法虽有缺苗较少的优点，但播种效率低，增产效果也不如套耧法好。
    （二）密植的播种量
    今年许思曾社的每亩播种量由十斤增到十七斤，根据生长情况他们认为还可以增到二十斤，胡雁雨社已由十二斤增为二十斤。衡水县农场的旱地播种量，由原来每亩六、七斤增到十三斤半，大善彰村周士英每亩旱地下种九斤，都比一般群众播种量高。
    总之，缩小行距后需要增加播种量是肯定的，但应照顾到原有基础及其他条件，适当掌握增减，如整地良好、播种早和小粒品种，播种量即可少用一些，相反则应多用一些。
    （三）关于栽培技术
    小麦密植必须与综合性的栽培技术结合起来，才能发挥其更大效能。我们从调查中遇到很多这样事实。在耕地方面如：许思曾社的整地较为合理，这个社的麦地在前茬作物收割后，随着就浅耕灭茬，进行深耕，有利于风化土壤，休养地力。第二次深耕在播种十天以前，在此期间进行了播种前的浇水。这样作既促使了土壤中肥料的分解，又可避免了播种后土壤下沉的弊病。
    在浇水方面，同样的石特十四号品种，衡水县农场比许思曾社施肥多二分之一，初春麦苗返青后还多浇一次水，但小麦生长不及许思曾社的好，主要原因是由于衡水县农场浇头水时地已龟裂，浇第四次水时地面干下六、七寸深，因而麦穗有干尖，产量受到影响。藁城兴安村武香元社到六月四日浇第五次水时麦穗已转黄，浇后又遇风，结果引起倒伏，且晚熟三、四天。由此可见，浇水必须视墒情好坏，并应根据气候和品种特点适当掌握，不能照规定的次数机械地执行。在春耙方面，衡水县北善彰村孙三刚社无意中进行了空耙与重耙对比试验，小麦生长显然不同，他们在开始解冻时进行了所谓“顶凌耙”，由于无经验仅拉空耙，只在地面划了些道道，最后剩下一块地，试行了人踩重耙，把枯草烂叶尽都耙起，表土疏松，当时还怀疑耙坏了，但在麦苗拔节以后，生长良好。这是因为耙掉枯草烂叶便于小麦生长，更主要的是耙松表土，流通空气，切断毛细管的蒸发作用，尤其在初解冻时进行，更能充分地保持水分。他们的井水不足，麦地仅浇水一次，实质上还是旱地，因此更显示了春耙保墒作用。在选种方面，如许思曾社所用种籽是河北省农场供给的优良品种——石特十四号，种籽纯度在百分之九十五以上，又经农场技术干部帮助作了盐水选种，结果生长整齐一致，穗大、秆硬，而藁城一带种的蚰子麦，本具有耐肥耐水、秆硬不易倒伏、早熟、产量高等特点，但在去年通过粮库调换时，混进足有四、五种别的品种，结果生长的高低不齐，成熟早晚也不一致。此外在防治病虫害方面如进行的好就可以减少为害，相反就会造成病株和缺苗，影响密植的效果。
    三、石家庄地区小麦密植的成功，解决了那些问题
    （一）密植是否会引起倒伏？
    1、宽垅的比窄垅密植倒伏的多。如藁城县兴安村武梦臣种植的麦有宽垅和窄垅两种，两种麦的管理施肥都一样，四月三十日雨后宽垅的倒伏面积有百分之五，窄垅密植的只有百分之二。在石家庄市的河北省省农场五月三日倒伏情况，大垅每亩播种量二十六万粒的倒伏面积占总面积的百分之八三点七，窄垅播种量三十一万粒的倒伏面积只占总面积的百分之二十七点五。
    2、地力过肥或肥料配合不当，倒伏的多。如许思曾社倒伏的麦都在菜园地，因为这种园地肥大，特别是氮肥多。而同样的播种量在一般地里并不倒伏。藁城贾村马洛魁水地密植麦土壤为粗砂壤土，地较薄，每亩施厩粪六千斤，棉籽饼一百斤，黑豆一百二十斤作基肥，并没有倒伏。
    3、浇水不当倒伏的多。如藁城县兴安村武香元社浇水不看天气，在麦已灌浆转黄，结粒沉重，天将刮风时还浇了第五次水，引起倒伏，由此证明水分过多，就会倒伏。
    4、品种的耐倒伏性。据各农场试验结果，鱼鳞白、定县七十二号、华农五号等品种，秆秸弱都易倒伏；南宫大白、平原五十号、蚰子麦、石特十四号等品种茎秆短矮直立，都不易倒伏。衡水农场同样的水地密植小麦，种植石特十四号品种的麦地，就没有倒伏，种植鱼鳞白品种的就有倒伏。
    这些事实，说明了栽培技术、肥料、浇水和品种对小麦的倒伏有密切关系，而密植是不会引起倒伏的，在范村农民们参观密植麦田后，都认为密植疏播还有相互扶持的作用。
    （二）密植是否需要粪大水勤？
    盲目的过多施肥、过勤浇水和不上粪、不浇水是同样的不好。武香元社的丰产水地密植麦播种量二十斤，行距五寸，施草圈粪七千斤，豆饼一百斤，小麻饼一百斤，花生仁饼一百斤，浇水五次。在六月七日观察，茎叶深绿，有二大片倒伏，并延迟成熟三、四天。在该村密植小麦经验座谈会上，大家一致认为该社丰产密植麦虽好，但施氮肥太多，白浪费肥料，刮风时浇麦又引起大片倒伏。石家庄市五区范村许兰珍的水地小麦也有同样情形，他的四分麦地，共上了八车（约一万二千斤）圈粪，灌浆时期，全部倒伏。据河北省农场调查结果证明土地瘠薄和过肥地对密植小麦的生育都不好。
    （三）旱地是否可以密植？
    小麦密植不但在水地成功，在旱地也获得成功。如衡水县大善彰村周士英的密植麦（行距八寸，每亩用九斤葫芦头种籽）实产一百五十七斤，地邻李润芝的稀植麦（行距一尺二寸五，每亩下种六斤多），平均每亩实产九十斤，还晚熟五、六天。两者自然条件相同（都是旱地），也都没有施肥，但收成相差很远。
    （四）密植是否能间作？
    石家庄地区麦收前有在麦垅间种晚谷，点豆或插山药（甘薯）等习惯。他们感到垅间太窄，不能间作，只有拔去麦茬，才能进行夏种。如天干不能拔只能割，留下的麦茬就使间种的作物耩不下去。如采用靠耧并垅法还可间种其他作物。同时选用早熟品种，如蚰子麦之类也有利于间作。
    四、对今后推行小麦密植的意见
    一、我们这次所接触到的农业社或互助组，均有多少不等的密植小麦在作各种对比试验，活的事实教育了农民，凡亲自看见密植成功的人，都计划今秋种麦时要亲自进行密植试验，群众的这种慎重接受新事物的事实，反映了稳步发展工作方针的正确性。从今年密植成功的组、社、村向外推广，树立更多的示范点，逐年推广，一定会收到很好的效果。
    二、严重的问题在于和保守思想作斗争。密植是成功了，但在开始推行，必然遇到各种抵抗情绪。如许思曾社原计划每亩用二十斤种子，而该社掌耧的思想不通，暗地里堵小漏籽眼，使每亩播种的种籽少了三斤至六斤多。石家庄市五区塔冢村孔花子的二亩密植麦，因收获时费工过多（十一个人拔了一下午，主要原因是拔麦人连日拔麦过于疲累和地面板结干硬，因而效率降低），使孔花子误认密植费工。他说：如果增产不多，还不够工资，就不如大垅稀植有利。因此推行密植，应该始终重视解决思想问题。
    三、加强技术指导和发扬群众在改进技术上的积极性和创造性。从范村和毛庄、兴安等村看，小麦密植成功和农场或技术推广站的具体指导是分不开的。这一经验是今后应继续大力发扬的。另据我们了解多数密植的麦田断垅、断条和缺苗的现象还很普遍，因此继续加强技术指导是十分必要的。进行密植小麦地区的群众对改进技术的情绪是很高的，如许思曾社已在研究创制适于密植的播种耧。这种积极性和创造性应该继续发扬。
