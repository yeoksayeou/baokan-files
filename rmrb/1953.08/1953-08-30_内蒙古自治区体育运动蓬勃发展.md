The sports movement in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has vigorously developed over the past six years under the leadership and assistance of the Autonomous Region People's Government and the Inner Mongolia Sports Association. Various ball games, track and field events, calisthenics, and national sports such as wrestling and horse racing have been widely developed in various banners, counties, and cities. Currently, Inner Mongolia has 1,104 men's basketball teams, 559 volleyball teams, 173 women's basketball teams, and 128 volleyball teams. In addition, there are many soccer, tennis, and softball teams. Track and field events are very active in various leagues and banners. This year, more than 400 track and field athletes from various leagues and banners participated in the first sports meeting of Inner Mongolia. Calisthenics have become a regular sports activity in factories, organizations, groups, troops, and schools in various leagues and banners. In Ulanhot, 86 units with more than 12,000 people regularly participate in calisthenics. In the Hulunbuir League, more than 20,000 people regularly participate in calisthenics.

The most active sports in Inner Mongolia are wrestling, horse racing, and archery, which are popular among the Mongolian people. These sports are not only popular among adults but also loved by children. Every year, many Mongolian elders, youths, and children participate in competitions at the Nadaam festivals held in various leagues and banners. This year, at the Nadaam festival in Beizimiao, Xilin Gol League, more than 500 athletes participated in wrestling, and 120 athletes participated in horse racing.

Since 1946, Inner Mongolia has regularly held various forms of sports meetings in various leagues and banners. Up to now, 13 sports meetings have been held at the league level and more than 60 at the banner level. Among them, the Nadaam festival in national form is the most common. These Nadaam festivals, which combine material exchanges and various exhibitions with sports competitions such as wrestling, horse racing, and archery, have spread from the banner level to the sumu level and even to individual gacha (villages) in the Hulunbuir League. The herdsmen participate very enthusiastically.

With the development of sports activities, new sports ethics are gradually being established. The bad practices of the past, where princes and nobles used wrestling and horse racing for amusement, creating opposition, hatred, and even secret harm among the athletes, have been replaced by the collective spirit of unity, friendship, and mutual learning. In previous Nadaam festivals, it could be seen that after one wrestler threw the other down, they would help each other up and shake hands. After the competition, the wrestlers also held seminars to exchange experiences and learn from each other. (Xinhua News Agency)

    内蒙古自治区体育运动蓬勃发展
    内蒙古自治区体育运动，六年来在自治区人民政府和内蒙古体育协进会领导与帮助下已蓬勃发展。各种球类、田径赛、广播体操和摔跤、赛马等民族形式的运动，已在各旗、县、市普遍展开。现在全内蒙古共有男子篮球队一千一百零四队、排球队五百五十九队，女子篮球队一百七十三队、排球队一百二十八队；此外并有不少的足球、网球、垒球队。田径赛在各盟、旗都很活跃。今年各盟、旗参加内蒙古首届体育运动大会的田径赛选手达四百多人。广播体操已在各盟、旗工厂、机关、团体、部队、学校中形成经常性的体育活动。乌兰浩特市经常作广播体操的有八十六个单位，一万二千多人。呼纳盟有两万多人经常作广播体操。
    在内蒙古特别活跃的运动，是蒙族人民喜爱的摔跤、赛马、射箭等民族形式的运动。这些运动不仅在成年人中盛行，也为儿童们喜爱。每年各盟、旗举行那达慕大会上，都有很多的蒙族老人、青年、儿童参加比赛。今年锡林格勒盟贝子庙那达慕大会，参加摔跤的选手达五百多人，参加赛马的选手也有一百二十人。
    内蒙古从一九四六年起，各盟、旗就经常不断的举行各种形式的运动会，到今年为止，以盟为单位的运动会已举行过十三次，以旗为单位的达六十多次，其中以民族形式的那达慕大会最为普遍。这种结合物资交流和各种展览会所举行的摔跤、赛马、射箭等等体育比赛的那达慕大会，在呼纳盟已由旗而普及到苏木，甚至在个别的嘎查（村）也举行了小型的那达慕大会。参加的牧民们非常踊跃。
    随着体育活动的发展，新的体育道德也逐渐树立起来。过去王公贵族以摔跤、赛马取乐，而造成选手们之间的对立、仇视、甚至暗害的坏作风，已被现在的团结友爱、互相学习的集体主义精神所代替。在历届那达慕大会上都可以看到摔跤的一方将另一方摔倒后扶起来互相握手的现象，在比赛结束后，参加摔跤的选手们还举行座谈会来彼此交流经验，互相学习。（新华社）
