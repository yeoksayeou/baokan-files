    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 3rd: TASS reports: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin handed a note to Aktimur, Counselor of the Turkish Embassy in the Soviet Union, on July 31st, replying to the Turkish Foreign Ministry's note of July 24th, reiterating the importance of the issue of foreign fleets increasingly frequently entering the ports of the Black Sea Straits, as raised by the Soviet Foreign Ministry in its note to the Turkish Foreign Ministry on July 20th.
    The Soviet government's note of July 20th pointed out: Foreign fleets, including giant warships, have been entering the ports of the Black Sea Straits with increasing frequency. The fact that a fleet of ten US warships and twenty-two British warships will visit Istanbul this July can be regarded as a military demonstration. The Soviet government expects to receive more information from the Turkish government.
    In its note of reply to the Soviet government on July 24th, the Turkish Foreign Ministry rejected the Soviet request made in the note.
    In its note to Turkey on July 31st, the Soviet Union again cited official materials to illustrate that since 1950, enormous foreign fleets have been sailing into the Black Sea Straits with increasing frequency. In the first seven months of 1953 alone, sixty foreign warships have sailed into the Black Sea Straits, with a total displacement of over 300,000 tons. The note said: "Given the above situation, when the number of foreign warships visiting the Black Sea Straits reaches the enormous figure mentioned above, the Soviet Foreign Ministry's request to the Turkish Foreign Ministry for supplementary explanations regarding the increasingly frequent visits of enormous foreign fleets to the Black Sea Straits cannot be considered an unexpected matter.
    However, the Turkish Foreign Ministry, in its note of reply on July 24th, felt it could adopt a very formalistic attitude. In this situation, doing so is devoid of any practical significance. The Soviet side's request for supplementary explanations on matters of significant importance to the Soviet Union is a very natural matter between two neighboring countries maintaining normal relations. Yet the Turkish Foreign Ministry believes that such a request from the Soviet side can be considered interference within the scope of Turkish jurisdiction, although such a conclusion is entirely unfounded."

    苏联政府照会土耳其政府重申美英舰队频繁进入黑海海峡的严重性
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部副部长佐林在七月三十一日交给土耳其驻苏联大使馆参赞阿克蒂穆尔一份照会，答复土耳其外交部七月二十四日的照会，重申苏联外交部在七月二十日致土耳其外交部照会中所提出的关于外国舰队愈来愈频繁地进入黑海海峡港口的事件的重要性。
    苏联政府七月二十日的照会指出：包括巨型军舰的外国舰队已愈来愈频繁地进入黑海海峡港口。今年七月将有十艘美国军舰和二十二艘英国军舰的舰队先后到伊斯坦布尔港口访问，这可以认为是一种军事示威。苏联政府期望从土耳其政府方面得到更多的消息。
    土耳其外交部在七月二十四日以照会一件答复苏联政府，竟拒绝苏联在照会中所提出的要求。
    苏联在七月三十一日再度致土耳其的照会，引用了官方材料说明，自从一九五零年以来，已有巨大的外国舰队愈来愈频繁地驶入黑海海峡。仅在一九五三年的头七个月中，已有六十艘外国军舰驶入黑海海峡，这些军舰的排水量共达三十万吨以上。照会说：“由于以上情况，当访问黑海海峡的外国军舰达到上面所提到的巨大数字时，苏联外交部要求土耳其外交部对外国巨大舰队愈来愈频繁地访问黑海海峡的事实作补充说明，就不能被认为是意外的事情了。
    可是，土耳其外交部在它七月二十四日作复的照会中认为可以采取一种非常形式的态度。在这一情况下，这样做是毫无实际意义的。苏联方面要求在对苏联有着重要意义的事情上作补充说明，这原是维持着正常关系的两个邻国间很自然的事，然而对苏联方面这样一个要求，土耳其外交部却以为可以认为是干涉土耳其权限之内的事情，虽然这种结论是毫无根据的。”
