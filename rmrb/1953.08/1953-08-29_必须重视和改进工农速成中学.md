In the past three years, China's Workers' and Peasants' Short-Course Secondary Schools have greatly developed. Fifty-six such schools have been established across the country, enrolling more than 20,000 students from worker and peasant cadre backgrounds. Some of these schools have gained certain experiences and achievements in teaching. However, considering the overall situation of these schools nationwide, there are still many urgent problems to be solved in terms of leadership, student sourcing and quality, teaching staff, and teaching materials.

The reason these problems have arisen is mainly because the education authorities and relevant departments have not deeply recognized the political significance of actively cultivating new intellectual cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds. In practical work, they have not placed this work in its proper position. The education authorities have not seriously promoted the principles and policies for these schools, lack specific leadership and inspection of their work, and have not systematically researched and summarized teaching experiences. Some provincial and municipal education departments not only do not see these schools as a key point of ordinary secondary education, but even regard them as a "burden." This is extremely inappropriate.

As everyone knows, our Party and the People's Government have always given great care and attention to the cultivation of new intellectual cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds, and have taken various important measures in this regard since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Workers and peasants are the main body of our country, the creators of social wealth. They are the fundamental force that determines the fate of our country. In old China, due to long-term feudal rule, especially the more than 20 years of fascist rule by the Kuomintang bandit gang, the vast masses of workers and peasants were deprived of the opportunity to receive education. This has increased their difficulty in learning culture, science, and technology today, requiring special care from the state. We must actively cultivate a large number of new intellectual cadres and technical experts from workers and from worker and peasant cadres who have undergone a certain period of revolutionary training, to serve as the backbone of various construction works. The working class must not only bear the leadership responsibility in the revolutionary struggle, but also bear the leadership responsibility in the construction cause. Our planned and step-by-step establishment of these schools nationwide is precisely for this purpose. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union has proven that these schools are an important and effective form for actively cultivating new intellectual cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds.

In order to improve the current situation of these schools nationwide, it is first necessary to further clarify the nature, principles, and tasks of these schools. These schools are to teach the basic courses of ordinary secondary schools (junior and senior high) in three to four years, laying a good foundation for students to directly enter universities. Since 1952, some of these schools across the country have begun to be affiliated with universities in a planned and step-by-step manner, becoming preparatory schools for universities. This task of the schools is extremely important. It would be obviously wrong to think that these schools are merely for improving the general cultural level of workers and peasants, and to confuse their nature and tasks with those of general cadre cultural supplementary schools. These schools cannot be equated with ordinary secondary schools; they must become the focus of secondary education.

Secondly, doing a good job in enrollment is an important condition for running these schools well. Unlike general schools, the source of students for these schools should be outstanding workers and worker-peasant cadres who have participated in industrial labor or revolutionary struggle for a certain number of years. Therefore, it is not enough to rely solely on the efforts of the education authorities; Party committees, trade unions, and government personnel departments at all levels must also strengthen leadership and support. All departments, especially enterprise departments, should view the contradiction between current production and learning from the perspective of subordinating partial interests to overall interests and combining current interests with long-term interests, attach importance to selection and transfer work, and formulate plans for cultivating workers and worker-peasant cadres, sending a certain number of qualified workers and worker-peasant cadres to these schools to study each year. For workers and worker-peasant cadres with relatively low cultural levels, efforts should be made to improve their cultural level, so as to fully prepare them for applying to these schools. Education administrative departments at all levels and these schools should also strictly implement the central government's regulations on admission conditions for these schools. Three years of experience have proven that if the students admitted to these schools are not workers or worker-peasant cadres with good character, good health, appropriate age, and a cultural level equivalent to that of a higher primary school graduate, it will not only be difficult to complete the teaching plan, but also inevitably cause great difficulties to the work of the school, affecting the state's plan to cultivate worker-peasant cadres. In order to attract more workers, especially model workers, to enroll, the Central Higher Education Department and the Central Education Department have proposed in this year's enrollment work instructions that a "worker return system" will be gradually implemented from this year, and the treatment of workers after enrollment will also be appropriately resolved. Therefore, in the future enrollment of new students, all localities must strictly examine the political, health, and cultural conditions of the candidates to ensure the quality of students. In enrollment work, any irresponsible phenomena should be overcome. Some departments cannot adhere to principles when selecting and transferring students, and make concessions in admission conditions simply to "take care" of cadres; some departments, because they feel that some cadres are difficult to handle, want to throw them into these schools as a "burden." These wrong practices are all contrary to the state's purpose of cultivating new intellectual cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds.

The issue of teaching staff for these schools should also be seriously addressed. The students in these schools are adults, with the characteristics of adults, and they need to complete their studies quickly, so the teaching staff must also have certain qualifications. Facts have proven that if these schools do not have a certain quantity and quality of teaching staff as a guarantee, the students' learning tasks cannot be completed. Therefore, solving the teaching staff problem is the key to running and developing these schools well. This requires that education administrative departments at all levels must unify their thinking and make appropriate arrangements to solve this problem. When formulating education development plans, these schools should be regarded as the key points of secondary schools, and when comprehensively considering the solution of the teaching staff problem, the needs of these schools should be met first. Of course, ordinary secondary schools also generally feel the difficulty of teaching staff at present, but the solution to the difficulty should be considered comprehensively, and the teaching staff problem of these schools should be reasonably solved when conditions permit. In the allocation of teaching staff, not only should these schools not be ignored, but also special care should be taken. In the distribution of university graduates, personnel departments at all levels must consider the special needs of the teaching staff of these schools, and give appropriate consideration in terms of quantity and quality. The education administrative departments of each province and city should also further implement the spirit of the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government on running these schools and worker-peasant cadre cultural supplementary schools, and transfer a certain number of outstanding teachers as the backbone of these schools. The leadership of each school should also earnestly do a good job in uniting teachers, actively helping teachers to gradually improve their political and professional level, and improve the quality of teaching. And education administrative departments, personnel departments, and local Party committees at all levels should also pay attention to transferring a certain number of outstanding cadres to preside over the administrative work of these schools.

In order to improve the quality of teaching and learning, the overburdensome nature of study must be reduced through streamlined course and textbook offerings. After the implementation of the classified teaching plan for these schools, ordinary secondary school textbooks are still used for each subject, lacking teaching syllabuses and textbooks suitable for these schools. The requirements and standards for teaching in each subject vary from school to school, and the content of teachers' lectures is generally too much and too heavy, thus increasing the students' learning burden, the teaching effect is not high, the students' learning outcomes cannot be consolidated, and the students' health is affected. If the problems of teaching syllabuses and textbooks are not solved, the teaching quality of these schools will inevitably be seriously affected. There are many difficulties in solving these problems, but as long as the Central Higher Education Department and the Central Education Department take active measures, the problems can be gradually solved. The solution of these problems will not only improve the quality of teaching, but also have a great effect on improving the health of students. It is also extremely important to strengthen specific guidance on teaching work, strengthen inspection and guidance work, and timely solve the problems existing in teaching, and seriously and systematically summarize teaching experience, and exchange and promote it in a timely manner.

In addition, the work of affiliating these schools to universities must be carried out in a planned, well-prepared, and stable manner, and should not be done hastily. If the conditions are not available for the time being, do not force the change of administrative leadership relations immediately.

In order to do all the above work well and run these schools well, Party committees in all localities must strengthen their leadership and supervision over the work of these schools. Experience has proven that any work cannot be done well without the leadership and supervision of the Party.

### 必须重视和改进工农速成中学

    必须重视和改进工农速成中学
    三年来，我国工农速成中学有了大的发展。全国各地先后成立了五十六所工农速成中学，招收了两万多名工人和工农干部出身的学生。有些工农速成中学，在教学工作上已取得一定经验和成绩。但就全国工农速成中学的情况来说，在领导、学生来源和学生的质量、师资、教材等方面，还存在着不少急须解决的问题。
    这些问题之所以发生，主要因为教育领导部门和有关部门对于积极培养工农出身的新型知识分子干部的政治意义，还没有深刻的认识，在实际工作中，没有将这一工作摆在应有的位置上。教育领导部门对工农速成中学的方针政策没有认真进行宣传，对工农速成中学的工作缺乏具体领导和检查，对教学经验也没有系统地研究和总结。若干省市教育主管部门不仅没有将工农速成中学看作普通中等教育的重点，甚至把它看作“包袱”。这是极不应该的。
    大家知道，我们的党和人民政府，对于工农出身的新型知识分子干部的培养工作，一向给予极大的关怀和重视，而在中华人民共和国成立以后，更在这方面采取了种种重要的措施。工农是我们国家的主体，是社会财富的创造者。他们是决定我们国家命运的基本力量。在旧中国，由于长期的封建统治，特别是国民党匪帮二十余年的法西斯统治，广大工农大众被剥夺了受教育的机会，这就增加了他们今天学习文化、学习科学技术的困难，需要国家加以特殊的照顾。我们必须从工人中、从经过一定时期革命锻炼的工农干部中，积极地培养大批新型知识分子干部、技术专家作为各项建设工作中的骨干。工人阶级不但要在革命斗争中担负领导责任，而且要在建设事业中担负领导责任。我们在全国范围内有计划、有步骤地举办工农速成中学，正是为了这个目的。苏联的先进经验已经证明，工农速成中学乃是积极培养工农出身的新型知识分子干部的一个重要的、有效的形式。
    为了改进目前全国工农速成中学的情况，首先必须进一步明确认识工农速成中学的性质、方针和任务。工农速成中学是要在三年至四年内教完普通中学（初中和高中）的基本课程，为学生直接升入高等学校打好基础。从一九五二年起，全国一部分工农速成中学已开始有计划、有步骤地附设于高等学校，成为高等学校的预备学校。工农速成中学这种任务是极其重大的。如果认为工农速成中学仅仅是为了提高一般工农的文化水平，和一般干部文化补习学校的性质、任务混同起来，那显然是错误的。工农速成中学不能和普通中学等量齐观，它必须成为中等教育的重点。
    其次，作好招生工作是办好工农速成中学的重要条件。和一般学校不同，工农速成中学的学生的来源，应该是参加产业劳动或革命斗争达一定年限的优秀的工人和工农干部。所以，单单依靠教育领导部门的努力是不够的，各级党委、工会和政府人事部门也必须加强领导和支持。各部门，特别是各企业部门，应该用局部利益服从整体利益、目前利益和长远利益相结合的观点，去看目前生产和学习的矛盾，重视选调工作，并应制定培养工人和工农干部的计划，每年输送一定数量的、合乎条件的工人和工农干部到工农速成中学去学习。对文化程度尚低的工人和工农干部，应设法提高其文化水平，为他们投考工农速成中学作好充分准备。各级教育行政部门和各工农速成中学，也应严格执行中央关于工农速成中学入学条件的规定。三年来的经验证明：工农速成中学招收的学生，如果不是品质优良，身体健康，年龄适宜，并具有相当于高小毕业文化程度的工人或工农干部，不但很难完成教学计划，而且必然要给学校的工作造成很大的困难，影响国家培养工农干部的计划。为争取更多的工人，特别是劳动模范入学，中央高等教育部和中央教育部，已在今年招生工作指示中提出，自今年起逐步实行“工人返还制”，对工人入学后的待遇也准备适当地加以解决。所以，各地在今后招收新生的工作中，必须对考生的政治、健康、文化等条件加以严格的审查，以保证学生的质量。在招生工作上，应该克服任何不负责任的现象。有些部门在选调学生时不能坚持原则，只为了“照顾”干部，因而在入学条件上有所迁就；有些部门，由于感到有些干部不好处理，因而想把他们当作“包袱”丢到工农速成中学去。这些错误的作法都是和国家培养工农出身的新型知识分子干部的目的相违反的。
    工农速成中学师资问题，也应该认真地加以解决。工农速成中学的学生是成年人，具有成年人的特点，而且要速成，所以师资也必须具有一定条件。事实证明，如果工农速成中学没有一定数量和质量的师资的保证，学生的学习任务便不可能完成。所以，解决师资问题是办好并发展工农速成中学的关键。这要求各级教育行政部门在思想认识上必须统一起来，必须对解决这一问题作出适当的安排。在制定教育发展计划时，工农速成中学应被视为中等学校的重点，在全盘考虑师资问题的解决时，应首先满足工农速成中学的需要。固然，目前普通中学也普遍感到师资困难，但解决困难应当通盘考虑，在条件允许的情况下，合理解决工农速成中学的师资问题。在师资配备上，不仅不应忽视工农速成中学，而且要特别加以照顾。在高等学校毕业生的分配上，各级人事部门必须考虑工农速成中学师资的特殊需要，在数量上和质量上给以适当的照顾。各省市教育行政部门也应当进一步贯彻中央人民政府政务院关于举办工农速成中学和工农干部文化补习学校的指示的精神，调配一定数量的优秀教师作为工农速成中学的骨干。各校领导方面，还应认真地作好团结教师的工作，积极帮助教师逐步提高政治、业务水平，提高教学质量。而各级教育行政部门、人事部门、各地党委，也要注意调配一定数量的优秀干部主持工农速成中学的行政工作。
    为了提高教学质量，应从根本上减轻学生过重的学习负担，必须适当地精简课程和教材。工农速成中学实行分类教学计划后，各科仍采用普通中学的课本，缺乏适合于工农速成中学的教学大纲和教材。各校对各科教学的要求和标准不一，教师讲课的内容一般过多过重，因而加重了学生的学习负担，教学效果不高，学生的学习成果不能巩固，并影响了同学们的健康。教学大纲和教材问题如不解决，必然要严重影响工农速成中学的教学质量。要解决这些问题，困难是很多的，但只要中央高等教育部和中央教育部采取积极措施，问题是能够逐步解决的。这些问题的解决，不但能够提高教学质量，而且对学生健康状况的改进也有很大的作用。他如加强对教学工作上的具体指导，加强视导工作，并及时解决教学中存在的问题，认真地、系统地总结教学经验，及时地加以交流和推广，也是极重要的。
    此外，将工农速成中学附设于高等学校的工作，必须有计划地、有充分准备地、稳妥地进行，不可草率从事。如果条件一时不具备，不要勉强即刻改变行政领导关系。
    为了做好上述一切工作，办好工农速成中学，各地党委必须加强对工农速成中学工作的领导和监督。经验证明：任何工作，离开了党的领导和监督，都是不可能作好的。
