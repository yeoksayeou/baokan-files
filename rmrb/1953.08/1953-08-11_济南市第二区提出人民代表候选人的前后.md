    On June 28th, the official list of candidates for People's Representatives in the Second District of Jinan City was announced. In the evening, many pedestrians were drawn to the red bulletin, and residents of various streets came out in groups to view the list; some left with knowing smiles, while others approached again with focused gazes. The red bulletin looked simple, yet it stirred the hearts of the voters so deeply. It was the result of over twenty days of earnest deliberation and discussion by the Communist Party of China in the district, various people's organizations, and the broad masses of voters, and it represented the common will of more than 60,000 people in the entire district.

    As early as the beginning of June, the voters were very concerned about the issue of proposing candidates for People's Representatives. Ma Guangtian, a Hui resident of Xianyuan East Alley, couldn't help but feel a surge of love for the people's government whenever he thought of the miserable life before liberation. Whenever he had free time, he would go to his neighbors to inquire "how to nominate" and find people to discuss potential candidates. "We must earnestly nominate people that everyone considers satisfactory," this was his wish at the time, and it was precisely everyone's wish. Eager to know exactly how to make nominations, the voters first listened to promotional reports on how to propose candidates and what kind of people to nominate, and actively participated in discussions. Some voters originally had concerns, such as not knowing each other well enough, how could they nominate people that everyone would consider satisfactory? After listening to the reports, they understood and generally said: With the combination of bottom-up nominations from voter groups and top-down joint nominations from various democratic parties and organizations, it would be easy! However, there were also some people who originally suspected "whether the higher-ups would just produce a list and ask everyone to tick it off," and their enthusiasm was not high. For example, Chen Renjing from the Lishanding Street electoral district believed that "What kind of election is it to just nominate the number of people that are going to be elected!" Therefore, she consistently did not attend group meetings. When the head of the voter group went to encourage her to attend meetings, she declined, saying: "You nominate them, the people you nominate can't be wrong, I'll just agree!" Later, comrades from the working group conducted in-depth visits with her, enlightened her, and finally got her to express her doubts and opinions. The working group cherished her democratic demands extremely, and gave her patient education and assistance, emphasizing that joint nomination was only to better promote democracy and help voters solve the difficulty of not being familiar with the situation, so as to nominate good representative candidates. Moreover, the proposed list was only a preliminary opinion, and voters could also nominate candidates at the same time. After all the nominations were made, the question of who was the best would still be discussed and voted on by everyone. Therefore, voting on the number of people to be elected was precisely to select the best from the good people. As long as everyone earnestly nominates and discusses, and then votes on the people to be elected, it is a truly democratic method. Furthermore, the electoral law also stipulates that if voters do not agree with the candidates, they can also elect any other voter they wish to elect, which is as democratic as it can be. After repeated consideration, Chen Renjing felt that these words made sense. Especially when she recalled the elections of the Kuomintang she had heard about when she was in school, although many candidates were nominated at that time, they were only there as "accessories," and those with the most money and power were always the ones who were elected! Moreover, at that time, the people had no right to participate in elections at all. How could it be like today, where the opinions of the voters are earnestly sought, so the more she thought about it, the more enlightened she became. Once the knot was untied, her enthusiasm surged. When the joint list was announced, she ate dinner early, settled her six children, and excitedly went to the meeting, as if carrying a great feeling: if she had participated in the meeting earlier to discuss it, wouldn't the knot have been untied sooner!

    At the beginning of the nominations, many voters always hoped to nominate people from their own street. Some voters in Dongchenggen were not satisfied when they saw that Zhang Meicun from their own street was not nominated in the electoral district. When discussing candidates nominated from other streets, they sat aside and didn't speak much. Liu Zhuxuan was like this at first. When others asked for her opinion, she said: "We don't understand the situation of other streets, how can we give an opinion!" However, the incorrect idea was ultimately resolved by her. "Nominating candidates should start from a comprehensive perspective,"
    "Only by selecting the best people from the good people can we make everyone feel satisfied," these were the words of the comrades in the working group. She pondered these words, and secretly compared the candidates from other streets with those from her own street. One day, she finally understood. She thought: Although people from our own street have always served the masses of our street in the past, and everyone is familiar with them, but this time we are electing People's Representatives, even if it is someone from another street, as long as their qualifications are indeed strong, if we elect them, wouldn't they be our representatives, and they would serve us in the same way? Why should we distinguish between this street and that street? When she returned, she remembered that Sang Junguang in the same courtyard also insisted on nominating someone from his own street, so she found Sang Junguang and told him about her ideological transformation process in detail. Sang Junguang felt that it was right after listening. Before long, the voters of Dongchenggen began to actively express their opinions. The voters naturally gathered in twos and threes to talk together. One day, Aunt Lei and her neighbors Mrs. Wang and Mrs. Zhang discussed while working, and compared that Zhou Fangqing from Dongxiaowan Street had the best qualifications. In the evening, Aunt Lei told her husband, Lei Xisheng, who left early and returned late, about what she knew about Zhou Fangqing. Lei Xisheng originally insisted on nominating someone from his own street. After Aunt Lei explained, he finally smiled and said: "Four liang is ultimately not as heavy as half a jin!"

        On the afternoon of June 20th, the joint list was finally announced. At the meeting to announce the joint list in each electoral district, the advantages and disadvantages of the nominees were introduced, and the nominees also met with the voters. Many voters heard the announcement of the joint list and came to understand the situation with great concern. Zhang Jixin, a flooring cart worker who lived at No. 5 Lishanding Street, finished work, hurriedly ate dinner, and was the first to arrive at the meeting; an old lady, Li, was recuperating from an illness and had never attended a meeting before, but she came this time. They had a common idea: the list jointly proposed by the Communist Party of China and other parties and groups, headed by the Communist Party of China, was based on everyone's nominations and had been fully discussed and studied by the masses. It was generally correct and should be recognized so that there would be a clue when voting!
    What were the candidates proposed on the joint list actually like? A cordial and moving scene appeared when the nominees met with the voters. There were four people nominated in the Furong Street electoral district: an eighteen-year-old young female worker, a homemaker, an apprentice, and a store manager. These people seemed no different from ordinary people, but their deeds of loyalty, close ties with the masses, and faithful service to the masses moved everyone. The voters listened carefully to the introduction of their resumes. One by one, they took the stage to express their determination to serve the people wholeheartedly. Their sincere and genuine words often aroused warm applause from the audience. After they stepped down from the stage and returned to the crowd, the voters continued to raise their heads high and watch them cordially. As soon as the meeting ended, many people praised them: these people are indeed good!

    Afterwards, the voters spent several days earnestly and enthusiastically discussing the joint list. As a result, the masses changed six candidates whom they thought were better qualified, and the remaining eighty-three were unanimously agreed upon by the masses. The voters generally supported these candidates. They said: The joint nomination headed by the Communist Party of China not only solved the difficulty of not being familiar with the situation for us, but also proposed a comprehensive and far-sighted list that can represent everyone's opinions. When discussing and voting on representative candidates in the Lishanding Street electoral district, the old lady Li, because she was so short of breath that she couldn't attend the meeting, repeatedly instructed her son to express her opinion on her behalf, supporting Zhou Fangqing, who was proposed by the joint nomination, as the official representative candidate.

    After the official list of representative candidates was announced, the voters were all jubilantly looking forward to the arrival of the election day. Dong Xiushan, a worker from Dawan Street, had just returned home from work and saw on the list that the election day was only a few days away. He hurriedly wrote to his son, who was working temporarily in Jiyang County, and told him to be sure to rush back by then. The voters in the Xiaowangfu electoral district carried out a major cleaning and washed their clothes to welcome the election day. Why were the broad masses so enthusiastically welcoming the election day? Dong Xiushan once proudly answered: "Before liberation, the reactionaries did not allow us to interfere in national affairs, but only allowed us to obediently serve them as beasts of burden. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we elect the People's Representatives, how can we not be enthusiastic?"

    济南市第二区提出人民代表候选人的前后
    安奇  志强
    六月二十八日，济南市第二区人民代表候选人的正式名单公布了。傍晚时分，许许多多的行人被红榜吸引着，各街的居民们成群结队地出来看榜；有的带着会心的微笑去了，有的目光如注地又走近了。红榜看起来很简单，然而它却如此激动着选民们的心。它是该区中国共产党和各人民团体以及广大选民二十来天认真酝酿讨论的结果，是全区六万多人共同的意愿。
    早在六月上旬，选民们对酝酿提出人民代表候选人的问题就十分关心。县东巷回民马光田一想起解放前的悲惨生活，就不由得泛起一股对人民政权的热爱。他一有空就到左邻右舍打听“如何提名”，并找人酝酿对象。“可得认真把大家认为满意的人提出来”，这是他当时的心愿，也正是大家的心愿。选民们为了急于知道究竟怎样提法，首先听取了关于如何提出候选人和提什么样的人的宣传报告，并热烈参加了讨论。有些选民原来是有顾虑的，譬如大家互相间不够了解，怎样才能把大家都认为满意的人提出来呢？听了报告之后，他们明白了，普遍说：有了自下而上的选民小组提名和自上而下的各民主党派、团体联合提名相结合的办法，那就好办了！然而，也有一些人，原来就有“是不是只由上级拿出名单，叫大伙来画圈”的怀疑，积极性不高。如历山顶街选区陈仁静就认为“选几个人就提几个人，算啥选举！”因而一直不参加小组会。选民小组长去动员她参加开会，她推辞说：“你们提吧，你们提的错不了，反正我同意就是！”后来工作组的同志深入访问她，启发她，使她终于说出了自己的怀疑和看法。工作组极其珍视她这种民主要求，就对她进行了耐心的教育和帮助，并着重说明联合提名只是为了更好地发扬民主，帮助选民解决不熟悉情况的困难，提好代表候选人。而且提出的名单也只是初步的意见，选民同时也可以提名。都提出之后，究竟那些人最好，还由大家讨论表决。所以要选几个人表决几个人，正是为了要从好人里头挑出最好的人来。只要大家认真提名和讨论，再把要选的人表决出来，就是真民主的办法。再说，选举法还规定了选民如不同意候选人还可另选自己愿选的其他任何选民，这就再民主不过了。陈仁静经过再三思索，觉得这些话确有道理。特别是在她回想起过去上学时所听到的国民党的选举，那时虽然候选人提得多，但也只是作“陪客”，选来选去还不是那些最有钱有势的人！何况那时人民根本没有参加选举的权利，那像今天这样认真来征求选民的意见，因而越想心里越开朗。疙瘩解开了，积极性就涌了上来。公布联合名单的时候，她早早吃过晚饭，安置了六个孩子，激动地到了会场，好像带着很大的感触：要是早参加开会讨论，疙瘩不早就解开了吗！
    在开始提名的时候，不少选民总希望提出本街的人。东城根有一些选民看到自己提出的本街的张梅村在选区中没被提上，不够满意，开会讨论外街提出的候选人时，坐在一旁不大发言。刘竹轩最初就是这样，别人征求她的意见，她就说：“咱不了解外街情况，怎么提意见！”可是，不正确的想法终归由她自己解决了。“提候选人应该从全面出发”，
    “只有从好人里头挑出最好的人来，才能使大家都认为满意”，这是工作组同志讲的话。她思量着这些话，暗暗地把外街的和本街的候选人拿来比较。一天，她终于想通了。她想：虽然本街的人过去一直就给本街群众办事，大家熟悉，但这次选的是人民代表，就是外街的人，只要条件确实强，我们把他选出来，不就是我们大伙的代表，一样给我们办事吗？为什么还要分这街那街呢？回来，她想起同院的桑君光也坚持要提本街的人，就找到桑君光，把自己的思想转变过程一五一十地告诉了他。桑君光听了也觉得对。没有多久，东城根的选民即开始积极表示意见了。选民们很自然地三三两两地聚在一块座谈起来。有一天雷大娘和隔壁的王太太、张太太一边干活一边讨论，比较出东小湾街的周芳庆条件最好。晚间，雷大娘就把自己所了解到的周芳庆的情况，告诉了早出晚归的丈夫雷希生。雷希生原也坚持要提本街的人，经过雷大娘一解释，终于微笑着说：“四两到底不如半斤的分量重！”
        六月二十日的下午，联合名单终于公布了。在各选区公布联合名单的大会上，都介绍了被提名人的优缺点，被提名人还和选民见了面。许多选民听到公布联合名单，都很关心地前来了解情况。住在历山顶街五号的地板车工人张纪信，工作完毕，急忙吃了晚饭，第一个到了会场；一位李老太太正在养病期间，从来没参加过会，这次也来了。他们有着一个共同的想法：以中国共产党为首的党派团体联合提出的名单是根据大家的提名经过群众充分酝酿研究出来的，大体上是错不了的，应该认识一下，选举时才有个谱！
    联合名单所提出的候选人究竟怎么样呢？被提名的人和选民们会面时，出现了一个亲切动人的场面。芙蓉街选区被提名的有四个人：一位是十八岁的青年女工，一位是家庭劳动妇女，一位是学徒，另一位是商店经理。这些人看来和普通人并没有什么异样，然而他们忠心耿耿、密切联系群众、为群众忠诚服务的事迹却那么感动着每一个人。选民们认真地倾听着关于他们的简历的介绍。他们一个一个地上台表示了全心全意为人民服务的决心。他们诚恳而真挚的语言不时地激起全场热烈的掌声。当他们下台回到人群当中以后，选民们还是不断地把头抬得高高地，亲切地注视着他们。一散会，许多人便赞扬着：这些人就是不错！
    随后，花了几天功夫，选民们极其认真热烈地讨论了联合名单，结果，群众改换了六名认为条件更好的候选人，其余八十三名群众都一致同意。选民普遍拥护这些候选人。他们说：有中国共产党为首的联合提名，不仅给我们解决了不熟悉情况的困难，而且提得全面，看得远，能代表大家的意见。历山顶街选区的李老太太在讨论表决代表候选人时，因为气喘得厉害不能到会，再三叮咛他的儿子，叫他代为表示意见，拥护联合提名提出的周芳庆为正式代表候选人。
    代表候选人的正式名单公布以后，选民们都在欢欣鼓舞地期望着选举日的到来，大湾街一位工人董秀山刚放工回家，看到榜上注明的选举日只差几天了，回去急忙给他到济阳县作临时工的儿子去信叫他到时一定赶回来。小王府选区的选民都进行大扫除，并洗了衣服来迎接选举日。广大的群众为什么这样热烈地来迎接选举日呢？董秀山曾经很骄傲地这样回答说：“解放前反动派不让我们过问国家大事，只许我们服服贴贴替他们当牛马，今天在共产党和毛主席领导下，人民代表由咱来选举，还能不热烈吗？”
