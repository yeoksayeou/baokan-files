Column: Reader's Letters and Commentary

    Many readers wrote with indignation, exposing the seriously inferior quality of various economic and cultural daily necessities they had purchased. The types of goods they exposed include rain boots, rubber shoes, flashlights, batteries, thermos bottles, fountain pens, badminton shuttlecocks, toothbrushes, toothpaste, matches, goggles, thumbtacks, bookbinding machines, gauze, ink, carbon paper, glue, chalk, locks, and children's toys, etc., the vast majority of which are products of private factories. Soldiers from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army reflected that the flashlights produced by the Guangzhou Xinji Factory were labeled "Long Range, Guaranteed Durable," but all of the thirty-plus flashlights they bought broke down within a week. The poor quality of flashlights and batteries is a relatively common problem, the above being just one example. Wang Zhaoqin, a farmer from Chaoyang County, Rehe, and Chen Baohua from Malou Elementary School in Lushan, Henan, wrote that the Jade Hand brand matches produced by the Tianjin Danhua Match Factory either failed to ignite or exploded with a bang, even causing burns to hands and eyes. Comrade Lei Ning from a certain supply department of the Volunteer Army wrote that the quality of Samsung toothpaste produced by the Shanghai China Chemical Industry Society was lower than before, and some tubes were not even filled to the top, with some containing as little as four-fifths of the stated amount. Many readers reported that some rubber products from Shanghai, Tianjin, Northeast China, especially rubber shoes and sneakers, often experienced issues such as glue coming undone and soles breaking. For example, Sun Mingzhi, a student from the attached Workers and Peasants Short-Course Middle School of Beijing Institute of Technology, saved up for two or three months to buy a pair of Hand Brand sneakers produced by the Dongchang Rubber Factory. After wearing them for only one basketball game, the soles broke in two. The Warrior brand sneakers produced by the Shanghai Zhengtai Xinji Rubber Factory are the most expensive on the market, but Zhuo Minghao and other comrades from the Xuanhua Sino-Soviet Friendship Association bought Warrior brand sneakers that broke at the soles and came unglued at the uppers in less than a month, despite not being used for playing sports or traveling far. A pair of Five Blessings brand sneakers produced by the Tianjin Yufu Rubber Factory that reader Qian Yufeng bought developed seven cracks in the rubber parts in less than half a month. The cork inside the Min Guang brand badminton shuttlecocks was replaced with rotten wood, so they broke as soon as they were used. Even previously well-known brands have seen a sudden decline in quality. For example, many readers reported that the quality of the Golden Star fountain pens is not as good as before, and the nibs are easily cracked or broken. Zhao Qiuli from Peking University wrote that he bought a Golden Star pen produced by the Beijing branch of the Golden Star factory, and it had difficulty dispensing ink, sometimes not dispensing it at all. After multiple repairs, it remained ineffective. Because he had long admired the reputation of Golden Star pens, he thought it was an isolated incident. However, after investigating, he found that more than a dozen people there had bought this "famous brand," and none of them worked well, either having difficulty dispensing ink or having the nibs "split apart."

    There are many reasons for the poor quality of products from private industry, the main one being the opportunistic business attitude of these manufacturers. Since liberation, with the restoration and development of the national economy, the living standards of the people have improved greatly, and the purchasing power has also increased sharply. Especially since the first half of this year, the market has seen a prosperity that is not diminished by the off-season. Under the conditions of strong sales, these manufacturers have adopted the method of shoddy manufacturing and reducing quality to pursue unreasonable profits, which not only directly harms the vital interests of the vast number of consumers, but also causes a waste of state assets. This situation is not allowed to continue and develop under the New Democratic social system.

    Helping the development of private industry that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood is a consistent policy of the People's Government, which means that private industry has obtained the social and economic conditions for forward development. At present, the country has entered the stage of planned construction, and China's past backwardness in production and technology will be rapidly changed. Generally speaking, one of the main issues for legitimate private industry to seek continued development is how to improve production and improve quality to meet the needs of national planning. Manufacturers (including state capitalist joint state-private enterprises) only need to honestly operate under the leadership of the state-owned economy, correct their business attitude, actively improve business management, and meet the needs of the broad masses of the people in terms of the quantity and quality of commodity supply, and they have a future for development. Conversely, they will inevitably destroy their own reputation and cut off their own future.

    In order to better help and supervise private manufacturers improve product quality, trade union organizations at all levels, especially grassroots trade union organizations in private factories, should educate workers to actively seek methods to improve quality and strictly abide by certain operating procedures. In particular, they should establish an attitude of responsibility to the people, realize mass supervision, and prevent the opportunistic behavior of capitalists.

    Many products of private manufacturers are processed, ordered, or purchased by the state. Therefore, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives also have the responsibility to help manufacturers improve their business management and ensure the quality of the goods they distribute. Therefore, it is necessary to improve and strictly enforce the inspection system to prevent inferior goods from entering the market.

    The industrial and commercial administrative departments should also fully recognize the harm of this phenomenon, educate private merchants, and change their business style. They should also take active measures to promote private manufacturers to improve quality and specifications. At the same time, they should attach importance to the reporting materials from the broad masses of the people, conduct in-depth investigations, and seriously deal with those whose circumstances are particularly egregious.

### 应帮助私营工厂改进产品质量

专栏：读者来信述评

    应帮助私营工厂改进产品质量
    广大读者怀着愤懑的情绪，来信揭发了他们购得的多种经济与文化生活用品质量严重低劣的情况。他们所揭发的商品种类，包括有雨鞋、胶鞋、手电筒、电池、热水瓶、自来水笔、羽毛球、牙刷、牙膏、火柴、风镜、图钉、装书机、纱布、油墨、复写纸、胶水、粉笔、锁子、以及儿童玩具等等，绝大部分是私营工厂的产品。中国人民志愿军某部的战士反映：广州新记厂出品的手电筒，上面写着：“射程远大、保证耐用”，可是他们买到的三十多只，没有用到一个星期，就全都坏了。手电筒与电池质量低劣是一个较为普遍的问题，上述仅为一例。热河朝阳县农民王昭勤、河南鲁山马楼完全小学陈保华等来信说：天津丹华火柴厂出品的玉手牌火柴，使用时不是不发火，就是爆炸作响，甚至发生烧手、烫眼等情事。志愿军某供给部门雷宁同志来信说：上海市中国化学工业社出品的三星牙膏，较之以前质量减低了，甚至有的装瓶也不满，竟有少达五分之一的。很多读者反映上海、天津、东北等地一些橡胶产品，特别是胶鞋、球鞋等，很多发生开胶、断底现象。例如北京工业学院附设工农速成中学同学孙明智，积蓄了两三个月的钱买了一双东昌橡胶厂出品的手牌球鞋，穿上以后只打了一场篮球，鞋底就折为两截了。上海正泰信记橡胶厂出品的回力球鞋，在市面上价钱是最高的，但宣化市中苏友好协会卓明浩等同志买到的回力牌球鞋，穿上以后既未打球又未远行，不到一个月便鞋底断裂，鞋帮开胶了。读者钱玉峰购到的一双天津裕蚨橡胶厂出品的五福牌球鞋，没穿到半个月，胶质部分便发生了七道裂痕。民光牌羽毛球里面的软木竟用朽木代替，一打即坏。甚至过去的名牌货，质量也骤然下降。例如很多读者反映金星钢笔质量不如过去了，笔尖很容易裂开或折断。北京大学赵秋立来信说：他买到了一支金星厂北京分厂出品的金星笔，使用时下水不利，有时根本不下水，经过多次修理，终归无效。因为他久仰金星笔已往声誉，只当这是个别现象；后经他调查，他们那里有十数人买了这个“名牌货”，没有一支好用的，不是下水不利，就是笔尖“分家”。
    私营工业产品质量低劣的原因很多，其中主要的是由于这些厂商投机取巧的经营态度。解放以后，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，广大人民生活改善，购买力大大提高，对日用工业品的需求也随之激增，特别是今年上半年以来，市场上出现了淡季不淡的繁荣景象。这些厂商在销路旺盛的条件下，采取了以粗制滥造、降低质量的办法去追逐不合理的利润，不但直接危害了广大消费者的切身利益，也造成了对国家资财的浪费。这种情况在新民主主义的社会制度下，是不能容许其继续存在和发展的。
    扶助有利于国计民生的私营工业的发展，是人民政府的一贯政策，也就是说私营工业已获得了向前发展的社会条件和经济条件。目前国家已进入有计划的建设阶段，我国过去生产和技术上落后情形，将迅速地改变。一般地说，正当的私营工业要求得继续发展，主要问题之一，就在于如何去改进生产、提高质量，以配合国家计划的需要。厂商们（包括国家资本主义性质的公私合营厂在内）只要能够老老实实地在国营经济的领导下，端正经营态度，积极改进经营管理，适应广大人民群众在商品供应数量与质量上的要求，是有其发展前途的。反之，就必然自毁信誉，自绝前途。
    为了更好地帮助与监督私营厂商改进产品质量，各级工会组织，特别是私营厂内的基层工会组织，应教育工人积极寻求改进质量的方法，严格遵守一定的操作规程。特别应树立对人民负责的态度，实现群众性的监督，防止资方投机取巧的行为。
    私营厂商的产品，很多是经过国家加工订货或收购的。因此国营商业部门及合作社，也有帮助厂商改善经营管理，保证其经销商品质量的责任。因而必须健全与严格验货制度，防止劣货侵入市场。
    工商行政部门，也应充分认识这一现象发展的危害性，对私商进行教育，改变其经营作风。并采取积极措施，推动私营厂商，改进品质规格。同时要重视广大人民群众的检举材料，深入调查，对情节恶劣者，进行严肃的处理。
