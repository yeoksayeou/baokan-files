Introducing Two Villages' Experiences in Preventing and Controlling Armyworms
Office of the Agricultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee

Currently, in most parts of Northeast China, the majority of armyworms have pupated. In the southern regions, some have transformed from pupae into moths and begun laying eggs, hatching the second generation of larvae. Therefore, all localities must learn from the lessons of the first generation larvae's damage, promptly strengthen forecasting and prediction work, and actively carry out pupae eradication, moth trapping, and egg collection to implement the pest control policy of "early treatment, minimal treatment, and complete eradication." We now introduce the experiences created by Wenfu Village in Dongfeng County, Liaodong Province, and Heitong Village in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, in preventing and controlling the first generation of armyworms, for reference in preventing and controlling the second generation of armyworms.

In late May, based on the forecast and prediction of the county farm, the masses of Wenfu Village in Dongfeng County, Liaodong Province, learned that armyworm moths had already appeared and were very dense, with the possibility of spreading. Under the personal organization and promotion of the county head and district head, the villagers promptly launched pest control work. Village cadres first used glass containers to hold hatching larvae, allowing the masses to see the appearance of the pests with their own eyes, dispelling the superstitious and conservative ideas of some people, and increasing their confidence in pest control. The cadres implemented a contract responsibility system, organized the masses to establish a joint prevention network, and universally went to the fields for inspection, thus launching a mass movement for pest prevention and eradication. Taking advantage of the armyworms' characteristic of being active at night, they organized many adults, women, children, and students every night, carrying lanterns to catch moths in the flowering onion fields. Some elderly people had difficulty walking and could not go to the fields to catch moths, so they inserted five or six bundles of corn or sorghum stalks on their own courtyard walls every night, inducing armyworm moths to enter. The next morning, they shook the moths down and trampled them to death. The villagers also carried out large-scale moth trapping and egg collection, inserting more than 28,000 large and small straw bundles in the fields. Each straw bundle could catch an average of six or seven moths and many insect eggs every night.

(Note: When using straw bundles to trap moths and collect eggs, pay attention to replacing them with new ones every three to five days.) Due to the adoption of such active measures, the village promptly prevented the occurrence and spread of armyworms, ensuring that crops were not damaged.

In mid-June, Heitong Village in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, discovered a large number of fourth and fifth instar armyworms. At that time, the villagers were busy weeding and there was a shortage of labor. However, the armyworms developed very rapidly, and there was an imminent danger of spreading and causing disaster. In early July, more than 40 county and district cadres and students from the provincial agricultural school came to the village to help control the pests, quickly established a pest control organization, and mobilized 510 men, women, old, and young to go to the fields to carry out a surprise attack on catching insects. In just three days, they caught all the insects in more than 300 hectares of land, curbing the spread of the pest and greatly reducing the loss from insect damage.

The main experiences of these two villages in pest control are:

First, do a good job of forecasting and predicting pest damage in advance, specifically organize the masses to establish pest control organizations, go to the fields for inspection, and catch and eradicate pests as early as possible.

Second, cadres implement a zoned contract responsibility system, specifically lead pest control work, and consult with the masses to come up with various effective methods for pest prevention and eradication.

Third, strengthen propaganda and mobilization work, use vivid examples to educate the masses, break the conservative and superstitious ideas of some people, and conduct patriotic education to encourage the masses' enthusiasm for pest control, so that pest control work becomes a conscious and voluntary action of the masses.

    介绍两个村防治粘虫的经验
    东北行政委员会农业局办公室
    目前东北各地大部粘虫已经化蛹，南部地区有的已由蛹变蛾，开始产卵孵化第二代幼虫。因此，各地必须接受第一代幼虫为害的教训，及时加强预测预报工作，积极进行灭蛹、捕蛾、采卵工作，以贯彻“治早、治少、治了”的防虫方针。兹介绍辽东省东丰县文福村，松江省桦川县黑通村在防治第一代粘虫工作中创造的经验，供各地防治第二代粘虫参考。
    辽东省东丰县文福村的群众，在五月下旬，根据县农场的预测预报，知道粘虫成虫已经发生，并且密度很大，有蔓延的可能。该村群众在县长、区长的亲自组织推动下，及时展开了防虫工作。该村干部首先利用玻璃器皿装入孵化幼虫，使群众亲眼看见害虫的样子，打消了某些群众的迷信、保守思想，增加了防虫信心。干部们实行了包干专责制，组织群众建立联防网，普遍下地检查，这样就掀起了群众性的防虫灭虫运动。他们利用粘虫喜在晚间活动的特点，每天晚上组织许多大人、妇女、儿童和学生，提着灯笼在开花的葱地里抓蛾子。有的老头、老太太走路困难，不能到地里捕蛾，每晚在自家房垣上插上五、六捆玉米或秫秸堆，诱使粘虫蛾钻入，到第二天早晨把蛾子抖落下来，用脚踩死。这个村的群众还进行了大规模的捕蛾采卵工作，在地里共插了大大小小二万八千多个谷草把子，每个谷草把子每晚平均能捕六、七个蛾子和许多虫卵。
    （注：利用谷草把子捕蛾、采卵，要注意每隔三、五天就另换新的。）由于采用了这样积极的办法，这个村及时地防止了粘虫的发生和蔓延，保证了庄稼未受损害。
    松江省桦川县黑通村到六月中旬发现了大量的四、五龄的粘虫。当时这个村的群众正忙着铲?，劳力不足。但粘虫发展很迅速，眼看有蔓延成灾的危险。七月初，县、区干部及省农校学生四十多人来村帮助治虫，迅速建立了防虫组织，动员了五百一十名男女老少下地突击捕虫，仅经三天，便抓净了三百余垧地中的虫子，制止了虫势的蔓延，大大减轻了虫害的损失。
    这两个村治虫的主要经验是：
    一、事先做好对虫害的预测预报工作，具体组织群众建立防虫组织，下地检查，发现害虫及早捕灭。
    二、干部实行分片包干专责制，具体领导防虫工作，并和群众商量，想出各种防虫灭虫的有效办法。
    三、加强宣传鼓动工作，用生动实例教育群众，打破某些群众的保守迷信思想，并进行爱国主义教育，鼓舞群众的防虫情绪，以使防虫工作成为群众的自觉自愿的行动。
