Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 23rd: The Military Armistice Commission sent an invitation to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the 23rd, requesting it to dispatch three mobile neutral nations inspection teams to South Korea to investigate the incident in which the Korean and Chinese side condemned the U.S. side for violating the armistice agreement by unreasonably restricting and obstructing the activities of the representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross Societies.

Attached to the invitation from the Military Armistice Commission was the full text of the protest lodged by the Korean and Chinese side at the 14th meeting of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee, and the statement made by our Chief Commissioner of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee at the 19th meeting. The above two attachments listed various incidents in which the U.S. side violated the armistice agreement and unreasonably obstructed and restricted the activities of the representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross Societies. The main facts of the U.S. side's violation of Article 57 of the armistice agreement include the following:

I. The U.S. military authorities endangered the safety of the representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross Societies: At 6:45 a.m. on August 9th, the representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross Societies were attacked by tear gas on Geoje Island. On August 13th, an American soldier struck Pan Fang, a representative of our Red Cross working on the Imjin River Bridge, with a gun, once in the chest and once in the leg.

II. Unreasonable restrictions on visits to prisoner of war camps: The authorities of the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp unreasonably stipulated that joint Red Cross groups should not enter any camp area. Representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross Societies could only watch prisoners of war from a place 100 meters away from the barbed wire. At the same time, each viewing was limited to only one camp area.

III. Restrictions on visits to prisoner of war camp facilities: The authorities of the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp stipulated that visits to dormitories, kitchens, and transportation equipment were not allowed when prisoners of war were present. Our representatives in the Yeongdeungpo group were simply unable to visit the equipment on the trains transporting prisoners of war.

IV. Restrictions on comforting prisoners of war and holding symposiums on welfare issues with prisoners of war: The representatives of our Red Cross working on the Imjin River Bridge could only talk to prisoners of war through barbed wire. When our representatives refused the U.S. military authorities' unreasonable inspection of our representatives' words of comfort to the prisoners of war, the U.S. side actually cancelled our representatives' visits. In Yeongdeungpo, due to U.S. inspections, our representatives were simply unable to make any comforting remarks to the prisoners of war during the three days from August 6th to 8th.

V. Obstructing the distribution of comfort items and letters of comfort: The prisoner of war camp authorities on Geoje Island prohibited representatives of the Korean and Chinese Red Cross Societies from distributing cigarettes and letters of comfort to prisoners of war.

VI. The U.S. military authorities also failed to provide due cooperation and convenience in terms of translators and communications.

    美方阻挠朝中红十字会代表活动的主要事实
    【新华社开城二十三日电】军事停战委员会二十三日向中立国监察委员会发出邀请书，请求派遣三个机动中立国视察小组前往南朝鲜，就朝中方面谴责美方违反停战协定无理限制和阻挠朝中红十字会代表活动的事件进行调查。
    在军事停战委员会的邀请书中，附有朝中方面在战俘遣返委员会十四日会议上提出的抗议全文，和战俘遣返委员会我方首席委员在十九日会议上的发言。上述两项附件列举了美方违反停战协定，无理阻挠和限制朝中红十字会代表活动的各种事件。美方违反停战协定第五十七款的主要事实包括下列各项：
    一、美方军事当局危害朝中红十字会代表的安全：八月九日晨六时四十五分，朝中红十字会代表在巨济岛遭受催泪性毒气的侵袭。八月十三日，美国兵举枪撞击在临津江桥工作的我方红十字会代表潘芳，一次在胸部，一次在腿部。
    二、无理限制访问战俘营：巨济岛战俘营当局无理地规定，联合红十字会小组分组不得进入任何营场。朝中红十字会代表只能在离铁丝网一百公尺以外的地方去观看战俘。同时每次了望都只能限于一个营场。
    三、限制参观战俘营设施：巨济岛战俘营当局规定，有战俘在场时不准参观宿舍、伙房及运输设备。永登浦分组的我方代表，根本不可能参观运送战俘的火车上的设备。
    四、限制慰问战俘及与战俘举行有关福利问题的座谈会：在临津江桥工作的我方红十字会代表，只能隔着铁丝网与战俘谈话。当我方代表拒绝美方军事当局无理地检查我方代表对战俘的慰问词后，美方竟然取消了我方代表的访问。在永登浦，由于美方的检查，在八月六日到八日的三天中，我方代表根本不可能对战俘作任何慰问讲话。
    五、阻挠分发慰问品及慰问信：巨济岛的战俘营当局禁止朝中红十字会代表向战俘分发香烟及慰问信。
    六、在译员与通讯等问题上，美方军事当局亦不给予应有的合作与便利。
