(Report from our newspaper in Tokyo) After the massive floods in late June in Kyushu, Wakayama, Yamaguchi and other prefectures in Japan, millions of disaster victims were displaced and in dire straits. After the floods, the Japanese Communist Party and other democratic parties, as well as democratic organizations such as the Japan National Relief Association, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the Japan-China Friendship Association, launched relief and reconstruction work in the disaster-stricken areas. The Chinese People's Relief Association sent a telegram to Tatsuji Fuse, Chairman of the Japan National Relief Association, expressing the Chinese people's concern and condolences for the disaster-stricken people in Japan, and on July 20, remitted RMB 1,236,470,000 raised for disaster relief to the Japan National Relief Association for distribution to the disaster-stricken people in Japan.

On July 29, at the initiative of the Japan National Relief Association, the Japanese Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, the Socialist Party Reconstruction Liaison Council, the Japan Federation of Industrial Organizations, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Japan-China Friendship Association and other twenty-odd progressive political parties and democratic organizations, as well as representatives from the disaster areas of Kyushu and Wakayama prefectures, totaling approximately 150 people, convened the "Japan Flood Relief and Reconstruction Symposium" at the Third Hall of the House of Representatives in Tokyo. The symposium discussed relief work, and then the participating representatives listened to a report by Hideo Namba, Vice Chairman of the Japan National Relief Association, on the receipt of relief donations from the Chinese people, and unanimously adopted a letter of thanks to Song Qingling, Chairman of the Chinese People's Relief Association. The full text of the letter of thanks is as follows:

To Chairman Song Qingling of the Chinese People's Relief Association:

The recent major floods in western Japan and Wakayama Prefecture have caused enormous damage to the lives and property of millions of Japanese people. The occurrence of this flood is a result of the neglect of mountain protection and water management work by successive Japanese governments during and after the war. In particular, during the seven years of the Yoshida Cabinet's rule, it has single-mindedly focused on restoring the vast military organization of the army, navy, and air force in the name of the "Security Force," spending huge amounts of the national budget, and never thinking of taking measures to protect the working people from the threat of floods and other disasters. Therefore, the occurrence of this flood cannot be said to be a natural disaster, but is actually a man-made disaster. Moreover, the government has not been able to formulate a fundamental relief plan for this tragic situation.

At this moment, the Chinese people sent a large sum of relief money to the Japanese disaster victims, which the Japanese people sincerely appreciate. This friendship shown by the Chinese people, like the boundless warmth and sympathy that the Chinese people have given to the Japanese people in the past for the Hokkaido earthquake, the coal miners' strike, the "Matsukawa Incident," and the sincere farewell of the Chinese people to the returning Japanese residents in China, will be forever remembered by the Japanese people.

Today, Japanese democratic organizations have formed a nationwide relief organization ("Flood Relief and Reconstruction Symposium") to provide relief for the flood and post-disaster reconstruction in the disaster areas, and will take democratic management methods based on the relief donations from your country to carry out the most effective relief work in order to thank the deep friendship of your people.

On behalf of millions of Japanese disaster victims, we extend our gratitude.

Japan Flood Relief and Reconstruction Symposium

[Another Dispatch] Yama Gaichi, Director of the Secretariat of the Japan National Relief Association, wrote to Wu Yunfu, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Relief Association on July 30, stating that the Japan National Relief Association had received the Chinese people's relief donations on July 27 and had transferred them to the "Flood Relief and Reconstruction Symposium" to carry out effective relief work.

    日本水灾救济团体
    函谢中国人民对日本灾民的关怀和救济
    【本报讯】东京消息：今年六月下旬，日本九州各县、和歌山县、山口县等地发生了大水灾，数百万灾民流离失所，陷于绝境。日本共产党及其他民主党派，以及日本国民救援会、日本工会总评议会、日中友好协会等民主团体在水灾发生后，即展开了对受灾地区的救济和善后工作。我中国人民救济总会曾致电日本国民救援会主席布施辰治表示中国人民对日本受灾人民的关怀和慰问，并于七月二十日将筹得的救灾捐款人民币十二亿三千六百四十七万元汇往日本国民救援会转交日本受灾人民。
    七月二十九日，在日本国民救援会的发起下，日本共产党、劳农党、社会党再建联络会、日本产业别工会会议、日本工会总评议会、日中友好协会等二十几个进步政党和民主团体，以及九州各县及和歌山县灾区代表共约一百五十人，于东京众议员第三会馆召开了“日本水灾救济与善后恳谈会”。恳谈会讨论了救灾工作，接着，与会代表听取了日本国民救援会副主席难波英夫关于收到中国人民救济捐款的报告，并一致通过了给中国人民救济总会宋庆龄主席的谢函。谢函全文如下：中国人民救济总会宋庆龄主席：
    这次在西部日本及和歌山县地方发生的大水灾，数百万日本人民的生命财产遭受了巨大损害。这次水灾的发生，是战时和战后历届日本政府忽视了护山治水工作的后果。特别是吉田内阁七年来的统治，
    一味在恢复以“保安队”为名的陆、海、空军的庞大军队组织，耗费了国家巨额预算，从来不想采取措施来保护劳动人民使之免受水灾及其他灾害的威胁。因此，这次水灾的发生，不能说是天灾，实际上是人为的灾害。而且，政府对于这种悲惨情况，还不能订出根本的救济方案来。
    正当这个时候，中国人民给日本灾民寄来了一大笔救济金，这使日本人民衷心表示感谢。这次中国人民所表示的友谊，和过去中国人民对北海道地震、煤矿工人罢工、“松川事件”等所给与日本人民的无限温暖的同情，以及旅华日侨回国时中国人民的真诚欢送，都使日本人民永志不忘。
    今天，日本各民主团体为了救济水灾及灾区善后工作，组成了一个全国性的救灾机构（“水灾救济与善后恳谈会”），将以贵国人民救济捐款为基础，采取民主管理方式，进行最有效的救灾工作，以答谢贵国人民的深情厚谊。
    谨代表数百万日本灾民敬致谢忱。
    日本水灾救济与善后恳谈会
    【又讯】日本国民救援会事务局局长山我德一，在七月三十日致函我中国人民救济总会秘书长伍云甫，说明日本国民救援会已在七月二十七日收到中国人民的救济捐款，并已转交“水灾救济与善后恳谈会”，进行有效的救灾工作。
