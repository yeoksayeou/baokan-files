Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 22nd: Hubei Province peasants have overcome the drought and achieved a bountiful harvest of early and mid-season rice.

Of the more than 24.5 million mu of early and mid-season rice in Hubei Province this year, 85% to 90% have achieved a good harvest. The increase in production in many areas is unprecedented in recent years. The areas along the Yangtze River generally increased production by 10% to 30%; some areas in Hanyang County increased production by up to 50%; the harvested high-yield fields in Xishui County averaged more than 800 jin per mu, with some reaching more than 1,300 jin. This harvest was not easily achieved. Since the beginning of spring, Hubei Province has been short of rain. At the end of April, when rice seedlings were transplanted, the drought-stricken area accounted for more than one-third of the total area. Some areas had dried ponds and rivers. However, under the leadership of local party and government organs, the broad masses of peasants actively launched a drought resistance and prevention campaign. Many waterless areas opened up a large number of new water sources. Areas where rice seedlings could not be transplanted adopted methods such as transplanting dry seedlings, old seedlings, and dibbling seedlings, and implemented mutual assistance to overcome the difficulties of transplanting. According to statistics from Xiaogan Special District, temporary labor exchange groups and mutual aid groups organized during drought resistance accounted for about half of the total number of peasant households in the entire district. The People's Bank of China, trade departments, and cooperatives also promptly issued agricultural loans and supplied a large number of waterwheels, farm tools, and seeds to vigorously support the peasants. Therefore, despite the drought, most areas completed transplanting three to four days earlier than in the past. By the time the seedlings were budding and heading in late June, drought reappeared in some areas, and insect pests also occurred in many areas. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions in a timely manner, correcting the passive thinking of some cadres and peasants in waiting for rain, and quickly replanted the land that had not been transplanted with drought-resistant crops, ensuring that no field was left uncultivated. The Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry organized many technical cadres to go to areas with serious insect pests to assist local organs in leading peasants to eliminate the pests or stop their development in a very short period of time, maintaining the vigorous growth of rice. Farmers in Xishui County have suffered four droughts similar to this year's in the past century, but the reactionary rulers in the past did not care about their difficulties at all. Therefore, those droughts caused serious crop failures and a large number of peasants fled to other places. Now, the farmers in Xishui County happily say: "If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party this year, we wouldn't have dreamed of a good harvest, we would have been waiting to flee."

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 22nd: Peasants in various parts of Guangdong Province have been widely building farmland water conservancy projects and carrying out drought prevention and resistance to strive for a good harvest of late rice. According to incomplete statistics from western Guangdong, northern Guangdong, and eastern Guangdong areas alone in early August, more than 22,000 water conservancy projects have been completed in the past two months. In western Guangdong, where the drought situation is more severe, after repairing more than 6,100 large and small water conservancy projects, 270,000 mu of rice fields were transplanted in time in early August. In Xiangshan Township, Hua County, northern Guangdong, rice fields used to be mainly irrigated by the nearby Da Pi River, but the river dried up this summer due to the drought. After research by cadres and peasants, the entire township dug 269 new wells and dredged old wells in ten days, solving the problem of water for transplanting more than 3,700 mu of fields. After the peasants in Wanlei Township, Lechang County, repaired and heightened an old dam, the irrigation area increased from more than 200 mu to more than 800 mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, August 21st: Financial departments such as the People's Bank of China, cooperatives, and trading companies in various parts of Guangxi Province are actively supporting peasants throughout the province in drought prevention and resistance.

Financial departments in various parts of the province have successively dispatched capable cadres to the drought-stricken areas to directly participate in drought prevention and resistance work. While assisting peasants in drought prevention and resistance, they solicited and listened to the opinions of the peasant masses, and then, according to the common difficulties and urgent needs of peasants in production and drought resistance in various places, they promptly issued loans, organized sources of goods, strengthened the purchase and production of local and special products, and supplied means of production and livelihood.

Peasants in areas such as Qinzhou Special District used all kinds of loans they received for production and drought resistance. Peasants in Lingchuan, Quanxian, Lingui, and other three counties have purchased 822 new waterwheels, more than 1,100 buckets, dippers, and water-drawing cylinders with the 400-500 million yuan in loans they have received, repaired more than 160 old waterwheels, and solved the food difficulties of more than 2,000 grain-deficient households. Leading cadres of county and district cooperatives in Fangcheng, Hengxian, Fusui, Liujiang, and other counties also personally went to the countryside to organize local handicraftsmen to rush-produce drought-resistant tools such as dippers, ropes, and dragon-bone waterwheels for peasants. In order to enable peasants to concentrate their efforts on drought resistance, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in many areas have established close ties, organized mobile teams and peddlers, and regularly delivered drought-resistant tools and daily necessities to the villages for sale to peasants. And according to the decentralized characteristics of the countryside, small-scale material exchange meetings were held between townships and villages in order to quickly supply peasants with various tools, seeds, cattle, and fertilizers.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, August 22nd: People in the Yishui River basin in Jiangsu Province have overcome the largest flood in recent years this autumn, ensuring the good growth of 10 million mu of sorghum and corn north of the abandoned Yellow River. The upper reaches of the Yishui River in the Yimeng Mountains experienced continuous heavy rains in early August. On August 4, the water level in Linyi, Shandong Province, reached 63.95 meters, exceeding the highest historical water level by one centimeter, with a flow rate of more than 6,000 cubic meters per second. In addition to some floods entering the sea through the Shu River in Shandong Province, a flow of 5,000 cubic meters per second poured into the lower reaches of the Yishui River in Jiangsu Province. Before liberation, the Yishui River was a disaster whenever there was water. There were 16 major floods in 40 years, each inundating 4-5 million mu to 10 million mu of land. After liberation, the Central People's Government began to guide the Yishui River in the first year of its establishment – 1949. More than 700,000 people participated in the Yishui River diversion project, completing the new Yishui River, more than 180 kilometers long and one to three kilometers wide, and the Luoma Lake reservoir. This year, the flood was tamed and entered the sea along the new Yishui River. The portion that could not be discharged was stored in the Luoma Lake reservoir. Farmers in Xin’yi, Siyang, Shuyang, Huaiyin, and other eight counties guarded the dikes day and night, inspecting and repairing dangerous works. At the same time, under the unified leadership and mutual support of the various basins, the Zahe and Yanghe shoal sluice gates increased the discharge flow, entering the sea through the abandoned Yellow River, the Liutang River, and the Yan River. As of the 18th, the water level of Luoma Lake had dropped from 22.5 meters to within 21 meters. The flood threat to 10 million mu of sorghum and corn in the Yishui River basin has been lifted. Early corn has already been harvested, with a general increase in production of about 20%. The Huangdun Lake emergency reservoir, which was originally planned for use in times of tension, has not been flooded, and the 300,000 mu of large autumn crops in the lake can be harvested.

    湖北农民战胜干旱早稻中稻丰收
    广西等省财经部门积极帮助农民防旱
    【新华社武汉二十二日电】湖北省农民战胜干旱，已获得早稻、中稻丰收。
    今年湖北省二千四百五十多万亩早稻、中稻，有百分之八十五至九十获得了丰收。很多地区增产之多是历年来所没有的。沿江一带普遍增产一成到三成；汉阳县部分地区增产达五成；浠水县已收割的丰产田，平均每亩都在八百斤以上，多的到一千三百多斤。这个丰收不是轻易得来的。入春以来，湖北省即缺雨，四月底插秧时，全省干旱面积占总面积三分之一以上。有些地区塘干河枯。但广大农民在当地党政机关领导下，积极展开抗旱防旱斗争，很多无水地区开辟了大批新水源，无法插秧的地区采用了插旱秧、插老秧、掇秧等办法，实行互助，克服了插秧困难，据孝感专区统计，抗旱时全专区组织的临时换工组和互助组达总农户的一半左右。人民银行、贸易部门和合作社并及时发放农业贷款，供给大批水车、农具和种籽，大力扶助农民。因此，虽然天旱，大部地区仍比过去提前三四天完成插秧。到六月下旬秧苗打苞吐穗时，部分地区旱象又起，同时不少地区发生了虫害。中共湖北省委员会又发出指示，及时纠正了某些地区的干部、农民等待下雨的消极思想，将没有插下秧的土地迅速改种了旱作物，作到了不荒一亩田。省人民政府农林厅组织很多技术干部赴虫害严重地区，协助地方机关领导农民在很短时间内消灭了虫害或停止了虫害的发展，使稻谷生长保持了旺盛。浠水县农民在近百年来曾遭受过四次和今年差不多的干旱，但过去反动统治者根本不关心他们的困难，因此那几次干旱都造成严重歉收，大批农民四出逃荒。现在浠水县农民高兴地说：“今年要不是共产党领导，做梦也不要想到丰收，只有等着逃荒了。”
    【新华社广州二十二日电】广东省各地农民近来普遍修建农田水利工程，进行防旱抗旱，争取晚稻丰收。仅据粤西、粤北和粤东等区八月初的不完全统计，近两个月来完成了二万二千多宗水利工程。旱情较重的粤西区修好六千一百多宗大小水利工程后，八月上旬有二十七万亩稻田及时插下秧。粤北区花县象山乡稻田过去主要靠附近的大陂水灌溉，但今夏天旱陂水干涸，经干部和农民研究后，全乡在十天内挖新水井和掏通旧水井共二百六十九眼，解决了三千七百多亩田插秧用水的问题。乐昌县湾雷乡农民把一个旧拦水坝培修加高后，灌溉面积由原来的二百多亩扩增到八百多亩。
    【新华社南宁二十一日电】广西省各地人民银行、合作社、贸易公司等财经部门，积极支援全省各地农民防旱抗旱。
    全省各地财经部门先后派遣了得力干部深入受旱地区，直接参加了防旱抗旱工作。他们一面协助农民防旱抗旱，一面征求和倾听农民群众的意见，然后按照各地农民在生产抗旱中的普遍困难和迫切需求，及时发放贷款、组织货源、加强土、特产品收购与生产、生活资料的供应工作。
    钦州专区等地农民都把得到的各种贷款，全部用于生产抗旱。灵川、全县、临桂等三县农民已把收到的四、五亿元贷款，购买了新水车八百二十二架，水桶、戽斗、抽水筒一千一百多件，修好旧水车一百六十多架，同时，两千多户缺粮农民也解决了口粮的困难。防城、横县、扶绥、柳江等县的县、区合作社领导干部并亲自下乡组织当地手工业者给农民赶制戽斗、绳索、龙骨水车等抗旱工具。为了使农民集中力量抗旱，许多地区的国营贸易公司和合作社已取得了密切联系，组织了流动小组和货郎担，定期将抗旱工具、生活用品送到村里卖给农民。并根据农村分散的特点。在乡与乡、村与村间举办了小型的物资交流会，以便迅速供给农民各种工具、种子、耕牛、肥料等。
    【新华社南京二十二日电】江苏省沂河流域人民今秋战胜历年来最大洪水，保证废黄河以北千万亩高粱、玉米生长良好。沂河上游沂蒙山区在八月初连续大雨。八月四日，山东省临沂水位曾达六十三点九五公尺，超过历史上最高水位一公寸，流量达六千多秒公方。除部分洪水在山东境内由沭河入海外，五千秒公方的流量涌入江苏境内沂河下游。解放前的沂河是有水便灾，四十年中发生大水灾十六次，每次都淹地四五百万亩到一千万亩。解放后，中央人民政府成立的第一年——一九四九年便开始导沂，七十多万人参加导沂工程，完成了一百八十多公里长、一公里到三公里宽的新沂河和骆马湖蓄水库等工程。今年这次洪水驯服地沿着新沂河入海，不及宣泄的部分便拦蓄在骆马湖水库。新沂、泗阳、沭阳、淮阴等八个县的农民日夜护堤，检查和抢修险工。同时，在各流域统一领导、相互支援下，皂河和杨河滩泄水闸都增加宣泄流量，由废黄河、六塘河、盐河入海。到十八日止，骆马湖水位已由二十二点五公尺跌入二十一公尺以内。沂河流域千万亩高粱、玉米的洪水威胁解除，早玉米已经收割，普遍增产二成左右。原来准备在紧张时使用的黄墩湖非常水库也没有进水，湖内三十万亩大秋作物都可以有收成。
