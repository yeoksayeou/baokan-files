Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 10th: The first conference of meritorious model representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Public Security Forces solemnly opened in Beijing on the 10th. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De attended the conference and gave instructions.

    Attending the meeting were 159 meritorious model representatives and representatives of ten model units. They came from glorious combat posts on the frontiers and coasts of the motherland, factories and mines, forests and grasslands, and vast cities and villages. Seven meritorious model representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Public Security Forces were also invited to attend the conference. They have all played a significant role in safeguarding national security and the construction of the motherland.

    On both sides of the rostrum in the conference hall hung large red plaques inscribed by Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. Chairman Mao's inscription read: "Raise Vigilance, Defend the Motherland." Commander-in-Chief Zhu's inscription read: "Better Accomplish the Glorious Task of Consolidating Border Defense and Internal Security." The conference hall was filled with banners and congratulatory streamers presented by fraternal units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and various departments of the Public Security Forces.

    At the beginning of the meeting, Ouyang Yi, Director of the Political Department of the Public Security Forces, delivered an opening speech. He pointed out that the purpose of convening this meeting was to commend achievements, promote the spirit of innovation, exchange experiences, and establish benchmarks; to use the glorious deeds of meritorious models to inspire the sense of honor and responsibility of the Public Security Forces, cultivate the noble qualities of public security fighters, highly promote revolutionary heroism, better complete the regular training with military affairs as the main focus, and various work tasks, and further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and safeguard the motherland's large-scale economic construction. Resolutely implement the instructions given to the conference by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

    During the meeting, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De came to the conference and gave important instructions to the meritorious model representatives. After recounting the achievements of the Public Security Forces in the three years since their establishment, Commander-in-Chief Zhu pointed out: The Public Security Forces are an integral part of the People's Liberation Army. According to the general task of the national armed forces, they, together with the Army, Air Force, and Navy, have a division of labor and cooperate with each other to jointly undertake the glorious task of consolidating national defense and protecting the motherland. Under this general task, the Public Security Forces must undertake and complete the specific tasks of guarding the borders, implementing border inspections and maintaining social order, suppressing remaining bandits, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, protecting state organs and important industrial facilities, railways, bridges, warehouses, and garrisoning cities, etc.

    Commander-in-Chief Zhu then explained: Our motherland has a long national border and coastline. The Public Security Forces should always be vigilant and well defend our borders. At present, a small number of remaining bandits and counter-revolutionaries in our country have not yet been eliminated, and imperialism is still constantly sending spies into our country to carry out sabotage activities, which requires us to be more vigilant in consolidating and strengthening the work of internal security.

    Commander-in-Chief Zhu also pointed out: In order to better perform their glorious tasks, the Public Security Forces should further strengthen their construction, learn from the advanced military science and military construction experience of the Soviet Union, and build the People's Public Security Forces into a force with high political consciousness, strict discipline, a pure organization, excellent military qualities and proficient professional skills, and modernized equipment, a steel-like force full of patriotism and internationalism; the Public Security Forces should also closely rely on the masses, lead the masses, guard against arrogance and rashness, learn with an open mind, and continue to promote revolutionary heroism.

    At the meeting, leaders of the Public Security Forces personally presented meritorious model representatives with badges of honor. Then, Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and representatives of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League delivered congratulatory speeches. Representatives of mass organizations in Beijing delivered congratulatory speeches and presented flowers to the conference. Representatives of the Navy, Artillery, Armored Forces, and Engineering Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army delivered congratulatory speeches to the conference. Representatives of various units of the Public Security Forces presented flags to the conference.

    Finally, Lu Ying, a representative of the meritorious models, delivered a reply speech.

    朱德总司令到会作了重要的指示
    【新华社十日讯】中国人民解放军公安部队首届功臣模范代表会议于十日在北京隆重开幕。朱德总司令亲临大会作了指示。
    到会的有功臣模范代表一百五十九人和十个模范单位的代表。他们来自祖国的边疆海防、工厂矿山、森林草原和广大的城市、乡村的各个光荣的战斗岗位。中国人民志愿军公安部队的功臣模范代表七人也应邀参加了大会。他们都在保卫祖国安全、保卫祖国建设中发挥了重大的作用。
    会场主席台两旁高挂着毛泽东主席和朱德总司令亲手题词的大红匾。毛主席的题词是：“提高警惕、保卫祖国”，朱总司令的题词是：“更好地完成巩固边防内防的光荣任务”。会场四周满挂着中国人民解放军各兄弟部队和公安部队各部赠送的锦旗和贺幛。
    会议开始由公安部队政治部主任欧阳毅致开幕词。他指出召开这次会议的目的是表彰成绩，发扬创造精神，交流经验，树立旗帜；以功臣模范的光辉事迹，激励公安部队的光荣感和责任感，培植公安战士的高贵品质，高度地发扬革命英雄主义，更好地完成以军事为主的正规训练与各项工作任务，进一步巩固人民民主专政和保卫祖国大规模的经济建设。坚决执行毛主席和朱总司令给大会的指示。
    会议进行中，朱总司令到会对功臣模范代表作了重要指示。朱总司令叙述了公安部队成立三年以来的成绩后指出：公安部队是人民解放军的一个组成部分，它根据国家武装力量的总任务，和陆军、空军、海军一起，各有分工而又互相配合地共同担负着巩固国防，保护祖国的光荣任务。在这个总任务之下，公安部队要担负并完成卫戍边疆、实施边疆检查和维持治安、清剿残余土匪、镇压反革命分子、保卫国家机关和重要工业设施、铁道、桥梁、仓库、警备城市等等的具体任务。
    朱总司令接着说明：我们的祖国有漫长的国境线和海岸线。公安部队应该时刻提高警惕，很好地捍卫我们的边疆。目前，我国仍有少数的残余土匪和反革命分子尚未肃清，帝国主义仍在不断地派遣特务到我国内来进行破坏活动，这就要我们更加警惕地巩固和加强内防的工作。
    朱总司令又指出：为了更好地执行自己的光荣任务，公安部队应该进一步地加强建设，学习苏联先进的军事科学和军事建设的经验，把人民公安部队建设成为一支具有高度的政治觉悟、严格的纪律、纯洁的组织、优良的军事素养与熟练的业务水平、近代化的装备的部队，充满着爱国主义与国际主义精神的钢铁般的部队；公安部队还应紧密地依靠群众、带动群众、戒骄戒躁、虚心学习，继续发扬革命的英雄主义。
