North China farmers are actively launching fertilizer accumulation work to prepare sufficient fertilizer for autumn wheat planting. According to preliminary statistics, in Shangdu and two other counties, a total of thirty-three townships in Zhangjiakou Prefecture, Hebei Province, have accumulated 4,750 cartloads of fertilizer. Among them, Hualinzi Village in Chongli County accumulated 1,500 cartloads in ten days. Ten counties in Tongxian Prefecture cut over 37.42 million catties of brambles and weeds. Some villages in Huguan, Qinyuan, and Youyu counties in Shanxi Province accumulated more than 100,000 dan of fertilizer through sanitation campaigns, composting, and green manure. In Qianxi County, Hebei Province, more than 82,000 people participated in green manure work, cutting more than 150 million catties of weeds. Handan County increased the number of pigs in seventy-eight villages by 345, and Wei County added 315 pigsties.

Some areas have promoted patriotic enthusiasm and actively helped the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers accumulate fertilizer. Twenty-nine villages in the third, fourth, and sixth districts of Qianxi County, Hebei Province, helped military families accumulate nearly 500,000 catties of fertilizer. Five villages including Gaoyu in Cixian County helped military families accumulate more than 25,000 catties of fertilizer. Thirty-nine villages in Shenze County mobilized more than 2,000 people in six days from July 23 to 28 to help the families of martyrs and soldiers repair sixteen pigsties, haul soil, and collect grass, totaling 1,155 large carts, 766 small carts, and more than 20,800 baskets, which can solve the fertilizer problem for more than 250 mu of land, laying the foundation for the autumn wheat planting of the families of martyrs and soldiers.

Some areas have also gained some experience in leading fertilizer accumulation work. For example, Zhao Gezhuang Township in Miyun County, Hebei Province, organized the masses to visit crops; Xinzhuang Village in the Second District of Shenxian County used folk schools to publicize fertilizer accumulation to the masses; Shuidaohou Village in Daming County held a forum for veteran farmers to compare the costs and benefits of coarse and fine fertilizers, reversing the idea of ​​"emphasizing fine fertilizer and neglecting fertilizer accumulation"; Raoyang County vigorously mobilized women to accumulate fertilizer to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor during the busy farming season. According to statistics from thirteen townships, nearly 3,000 women participated in fertilizer accumulation, accounting for 73 percent of the total number of people.

At present, the development of fertilizer accumulation work in North China is still very uneven, and the leadership is still weak in areas lacking fertilizer accumulation habits. Some places still have a laissez-faire phenomenon, and insufficient attention is paid to supplying the masses with coal to actively develop new fertilizer sources and fertilizer accumulation techniques. All localities must further solve these problems.

    华北农民努力积肥准备种麦
    华北区农民积极展开积肥工作，为秋季种麦作好足够的肥料准备。据初步统计，河北省张家口专区商都等三个县三十三个乡已积肥四千七百五十车，其中崇礼县化林子村十天内即积肥一千五百车；通县专区十个县割荆条、杂草三千七百四十二万余斤；山西省壶关、沁源、右玉等县部分乡村通过开展卫生大扫除、沤肥、压绿肥等办法积肥十余万担；河北省迁西县有八万二千余人参加压绿肥的工作，割杂草一亿五千余万斤；邯郸县有七十八个村增猪三百四十五口；魏县增猪圈三百一十五个。
    有些地区的农民发扬了爱国热情，积极帮助革命烈士和革命军人家属积肥。河北省迁西县三、四、六区二十九个村帮助军属积肥近五十万斤；磁县高峪等五个村帮助军属积肥二万五千余斤；深泽县三十九个村在七月二十三日至二十八日的六天内，出动二千余人，帮助烈、军属修猪圈十六个，拉土、打草一千一百五十五大车、七百六十六小车、二万零八百余筐，能解决二百五十多亩土地的肥料问题，打下了烈、军属秋季种麦的基础。
    有些地区也取得了领导积肥工作的若干经验。如河北省密云县赵各庄乡组织群众参观庄稼；深县二区辛庄村利用民校向群众宣传积肥；大名县水道后村召开老农座谈会，比较了粗细肥的成本、收益，扭转了“重细肥、轻积肥”的思想；饶阳县为解决农忙时节劳动力不足的困难，大力发动妇女积肥，据十三个乡统计，参加积肥的妇女近三千人，占总人数的百分之七十三。
    目前华北区积肥工作的开展还很不平衡，对缺乏积肥习惯的地区仍领导不力，某些地方还有放任自流现象，并对供应群众煤炭以积极开辟新肥源和积肥技术注意不够，各地必须进一步解决这些问题。
