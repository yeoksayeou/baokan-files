Editor's Note: To implement the enterprise's planned management work and responsibility system, it is necessary to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. Organizing labor competitions is an important method for leveraging the creative labor of workers and is a crucial link in implementing planned management and the responsibility system. The experience of the No. 356 State-owned Factory Tool Workshop in organizing labor competitions can serve as a reference for other factories and mines.

	Organizing Red Flag Competition Around Implementing the Work Plan
	Bai Haoqing, Chairman of the Trade Union of the No. 356 State-owned Factory Tool Workshop
	The production task of the No. 356 State-owned Factory this year is very heavy. Not only is the complete product set new, but the specifications are also very strict. The factory's production plan is: to focus all efforts on the trial manufacturing and finalization of new products in the first half of the year, and to produce them in large quantities in the second half of the year. In order to successfully complete the state's production tasks, our tool workshop launched a red flag competition in February, which has now been going on for several months.

	At the beginning, the competition was very enthusiastic, and it seemed very lively with challenges and responses; however, it did not play a significant role in production. The production of tools could not keep up with the needs of trial manufacturing and finalization work. Comrades in the metalworking workshop often waited by the machines in the tool workshop for cutting tools, templates, and chucks; on the other hand, the quality of the products produced was very poor. The number of reworks for a certain product produced in April reached 30 percent. Although the entire workshop averaged three to four hours of overtime per person per day, there was no confidence in completing the production tasks, so everyone's enthusiasm could not be consolidated, and they began to show indifference to the competition.

	This situation soon attracted the attention of the Party, administrative, trade union, and Youth League leaders in the workshop, who decided to find the problems and correct them. Under the leadership of the Party General Branch, a workshop cadre meeting was held at the end of April, focusing on the red flag competition before April. Before the research, the cadres felt depressed in their thinking. They thought, "Why isn't the competition energetic?" Some comrades even complained, "The workers in our workshop are too unawakened." Later, everyone analyzed the situation from all aspects and explained that it was definitely not that the workers' awareness was not high enough, but that their own work was not in place. There were several reasons:

	One was that when the competition was launched at the beginning, the reasoning and methods of the competition were not explained to the workers. Although the leaders understood in their minds that the competition was to successfully complete the state's new product production tasks, the masses did not know; not only that, but even the reasoning behind the country entering the great Five-Year Plan for economic construction was not linked to the competition to educate the workers. Therefore, no matter how much we encouraged activists to challenge and respond, it could only be lively for a while, but the majority of the masses did not move. Therefore, the competition lacked a solid ideological foundation.

	Another reason was that the workshop's production was in a state of extreme confusion for a long time. After the new product task was issued, the administrative leaders only worried about not completing the production task, but did not meticulously rectify and arrange production. The administration could not produce a production plan for several months, and even if there was a plan, it was just some inaccurate numbers, and these numbers were not given to the masses. Therefore, the competition lacked a specific goal to strive for. Because there was no work plan, we did not know today which product to produce tomorrow, and sometimes the product task assigned at the beginning of the month was not known whether it was produced by the end of the month. The supply of drawings and materials was also not timely. This chaotic situation made it impossible for the workers to exert their strength.

	Furthermore, the leaders only shouted slogans and were unwilling to do in-depth and meticulous ideological work. There were many cases of disunity within the groups, which affected the competition from being truly launched and sustained.

	Now that the problems were found, how to improve them?

	First of all, the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League were divided into labor, and it was decided that the trade union would lead the red flag competition with all its strength. Secondly, a survey and classification of the ideological state of the masses in the entire workshop was conducted. After clarifying the basic ideological situation of the masses, the mobilization work for the competition was re-conducted, the significance and purpose of the competition were repeatedly explained, the methods and methods of the competition were explained, and the reward methods of the competition were revised. In addition, the following links were specifically grasped during the competition process:

	Formulate a Work Plan to Organize the Competition

	Grasping the discussion and implementation of the work plan in the competition has two major benefits:

	First, because the work plan involves everyone, it can mobilize all the people in the entire workshop. First, it forces the workshop cadres to consider the production arrangements for the next stage, and to hand over production figures, drawings, and materials to each production team. Although those figures are not accurate yet, and the supply of drawings and materials cannot be completely on time, it has greatly reduced the chaos in production, and production has gradually become more balanced. The situation in June has improved greatly compared to May.

	Second, after the production plan has been discussed, the plan is no longer an empty number. The workers have a specific goal and a way to complete the plan. In addition, the leaders are more able to solve problems in a timely manner, and the trade union strengthens political education, which greatly encourages the enthusiasm of the workers.

	However, it is not easy to start discussing and implementing the work plan, because everyone is used to producing freely and finds the work plan troublesome. At this time, the trade union vigorously helps each production team to calculate the details and formulate plans specifically. Based on the special circumstances of the tool workshop's production, we decided to discuss the work plan once a week at the beginning. After each production team executed the work plan for a week, they realized the benefits of the work plan, and it was much smoother to formulate the work plan next time. In order to help implement the work plan, we also set up a production progress chart in the workshop. Everyone calculates the details in front of the progress chart after work: calculating how much of the plan has been completed and which ones have not been completed. There is also a "knack platform" set up in the workshop, and a large number of knacks appear every week. The knacks proposed by worker He Guizhuang increased the production efficiency of reamers by twenty times, which has a significant impact on the completion of production tasks in the entire workshop.

	Do a Good Job in Group Ideological Work

	In order to make the competition develop in depth and persistently, the trade union corrected the shortcomings of the previous stage, which only had general calls and was not in-depth enough. It selected key points, cultivated typical examples, and set examples for everyone to learn from. The trade union put a lot of effort into cultivating the Xie Qinglin group of the cutting tool section. The Xie Qinglin group is a production group combining lathe, milling, and fitter workers, with five master workers and sixteen apprentices in the group. The main problem in the group is the disunity among the master workers. When the trade union went to help the group discuss the work plan for the first week of May, as soon as the numbers were laid out, Deng Xianggen, the master worker and production team leader, said: "It is impossible to complete." After the production team leader said it could not be completed, the apprentices dared not speak, and other master workers said: "If the production team leader says it cannot be completed, of course it cannot be completed!" Xie Qinglin, the trade union group leader, saw that everyone's mood was wrong and lost confidence. The work plan could not be discussed. The trade union cadres immediately divided up to conduct individual education, especially strengthening the education of Deng Xianggen and Xie Qinglin, and using detailed calculations to strengthen their confidence in completing the plan. Deng Xianggen's thinking began to clear up, but everyone did not support him. Milling worker He Guizhuang said: "If you can turn it out, I won't mill it, let's see if you can complete the production task?" In this way, we saw clearly the seriousness of the disunity within this group, and comprehensively conducted unity education to the group, pointing out the production losses caused by the disunity. At the same time we strengthened the education of Deng Xianggen, pointing out the disadvantages of his violent temper. When the education was effective, a unity meeting of the entire group was held, Deng Xianggen made a self-criticism, and others also made self-criticisms. The entire group was united in thought.

	After Xie Qinglin's group was united, production quickly showed results: the weekly output was 250 pieces in early May, and it increased to 813 pieces by mid-June. Only one defective product was produced in one and a half months. They also played a model role in observing labor discipline and operating procedures.

	Because they made significant achievements in production, when the workshop summarized production in May, red flags were inserted on all the lathes and milling machines of their group, and they received material rewards. The award to the Xie Qinglin group gave great encouragement to the production groups in the entire workshop.

	From the process of cultivating the Xie Qinglin group, we realized that it is very important to strengthen the education of production group leaders and trade union group leaders. Because the production group leaders and trade union group leaders are both technically better, their words and deeds have a decisive effect on the production in the group. If the group leaders are mobilized, the competition will develop more rapidly and deeply.

	We strengthened the ideological education of the group leaders in two ways:

	First, we strengthened the group leaders' responsibility education, encouraged them to consciously use their brains, think of ways, and mobilize everyone to complete the task. Take the grinding group as an example: Production group leader Pu Yun once proposed "The task is heavy, the machines are few, there are few master workers, there are many apprentices, and I am afraid that the task cannot be completed," and was unwilling to do it. But Pu Yun is an activist and had previously applied to join the Party. We combined his political requirements with the production situation in the group to conduct education, telling him: "As a Party member to demand himself, he should stand up in the face of difficulties and think of ways to overcome them. The responsibility of the group leader is to lead the entire group to complete the task." At the same time, we helped him analyze and study the favorable conditions for completing the task, what are the difficulties, and what methods can be used to overcome these difficulties, helping him to establish confidence in completing the task. Another example is Zhu Dading, the trade union group leader of this group, who lacked confidence in completing the task and wanted to rely on the higher authorities to add people and machines. We helped him mobilize the masses, telling him: everything will be possible by mobilizing the masses, but the idea of simply relying on the leadership is wrong. When the thoughts of the two group leaders were cleared, they led the entire group to use their brains to find tricks, and finally the task was completed very well. Now, the Pu Yun production group is a relatively advanced group in the entire workshop.

	Secondly, help each group leader analyze the situation, solve specific problems, and help them think of ways to overcome difficulties. The trade union's specific assistance to each group mainly focuses on grasping the discussion of the work plan, checking the work plan, and helping them summarize production and study the situation. In the process of this assistance, we work with them to mobilize the masses to complete the task. This specific assistance enables each group leader to be bold and full of confidence in leading the competition.

	Because the education of the group leaders has been strengthened, the intentions of the leadership are relatively easy to convey, so the red flag competition in the entire workshop is progressing rapidly, developing relatively balanced, and the production enthusiasm of the workers in the entire workshop is very high.

	Improve the Skills of Apprentices

	From the process of cultivating the Xie Qinglin group, we also realized that we must list the training of apprentices as one of the main contents of the red flag competition. Half of the workers in our workshop are apprentices who have just arrived at the factory for three or four months. To complete the heavy production tasks this year, one of the keys is to quickly train apprentices.

	In the work of training apprentices, we first strengthened the education of master workers, explaining that the country's industrial construction needs a large number of talents, and the current heavy production tasks in the factory also require the apprentices to be trained as formal workers as soon as possible, so that they establish the glorious idea of bringing more apprentices and quickly teaching apprentices to master the technology. The trade union pays great attention to solving the conservative ideas that generally exist in master workers at the beginning and holds a forum for exchanging experiences in training apprentices. On the other hand, the Youth League strengthens the education of apprentices, establishing the idea of respecting the master and learning technology with humility and enthusiasm. After doing these two aspects of education work well, apprenticeship contracts are universally signed.

	After the work from May to June, the vast majority of apprentices can operate the machine independently and produce general products. Many master workers have earnestly implemented the guarantee of "patiently training apprentices." When apprentices first get on the machine, it is inevitable that they will produce defective products. The apprentices are very afraid. The master workers encourage the apprentices not to be afraid and carefully tell the apprentices the reasons for the defective products, pointing out how not to produce defective products. The master-apprentice relationship in the entire workshop is very harmonious.

	The competition in our tool workshop has made great progress after this series of work. Production has increased rapidly, production tasks have been completed, the scrap rate has been reduced to 1.2%, and the rework rate has been reduced to 8%. The chaotic phenomenon in production has been gradually overcome, and the phenomenon of working overtime has been greatly reduced.

	In the whole process of the competition, we realize that it is very important to change the leadership style. Leaders who shout slogans cannot make the competition in-depth. They must be down-to-earth, study problems and solve problems with the masses, explain the truth clearly, set an example, and repeatedly and patiently educate the masses, so that the competition can gradually deepen and last. We also realize that the purpose of the competition must be to complete the state plan, and the competition must serve the central requirements of the factory at every period. If our tool workshop does not serve the trial production and finalization of new products in the factory, but blindly proposes to compete for completing output and improving quality in general terms, the effect of the competition will certainly be very poor.

### 围绕贯彻作业计划组织红旗竞赛

专栏：

    编者按：要贯彻企业的计划管理工作和责任制度，必须发动广大职工的积极性。组织劳动竞赛是发挥职工创造性劳动的重要方法，是贯彻计划管理与责任制的一个重要环节。国营三五六厂工具车间组织劳动竞赛的经验，可作其它厂矿的参考。
    围绕贯彻作业计划组织红旗竞赛
    国营三五六厂工具车间工会主席  白浩清
    国营三五六厂今年的生产任务很繁重，不仅全套产品是新的，而且规格要求很严。全厂的生产计划是：上半年全力进行新产品的试造和定型，下半年大量生产。为了圆满地完成国家生产任务，我们工具车间从二月份开始发动了红旗竞赛，到现在已经好几个月了。
    开始的时候，竞赛轰起来了，看去很热闹，你挑战，我应战；可是在生产上起的作用却不大。工具的生产跟不上试制、定型工作的需要，金工车间的同志们经常到工具车间机器旁边等着要刀具、样板、夹头；另一方面生产出来的产品质量很坏，四月份生产的某号产品，返工数达百分之三十。虽然整个车间平均每个人每天要加班三个至四个钟点，但对完成生产任务却没有信心，因而大家的热情就不能巩固，对竞赛开始表示冷淡。
    这种情况不久就引起车间党、行政、工会、青年团领导上的注意，决定把毛病找出来，加以改正。在党总支的领导下，四月底召开了车间干部会议，着重研究了四月份前的红旗竞赛。研究前，干部在思想上感到苦闷，他们想：“为什么竞赛不起劲呢？”有的同志还埋怨说：“我们车间的人觉悟太低。”后来，大家把各方面的情况凑起来一分析，说明绝不是工人的觉悟不高，主要的是自己的工作不到家。原因有几个：
    一个是开始发动竞赛就没有向工人讲清竞赛的道理和办法，领导思想上虽然明白竞赛是为了圆满地完成国家所给予的新产品的生产任务，群众却不知道；不仅这样，连国家进入伟大的五年计划经济建设时期的道理也没有和竞赛联系起来，向职工进行教育。因此，不管怎样去鼓励积极分子挑战、应战，只能热闹一时，多数群众却不动。因此竞赛没有巩固的思想基础。
    另一个原因是车间的生产长时期处于极混乱的状态，新产品的任务下达之后，行政领导上只耽心生产任务完不成，却没有细致地去整顿、安排生产。行政上几个月作不出生产计划，即使有计划也只是些不准确的数字，并且这些数字也不交给群众。因此，竞赛没有具体奋斗目标。因为没有作业计划，今天不知道明天需要生产那号产品，有时月初交下的产品任务，到月尾还不知道生产了没有。图纸、材料的供应也不及时。这种混乱情况使得工人有劲也使不上。
    再就是领导上只高喊口号，不肯做深入细致的思想工作，许多小组内有不团结现象，影响竞赛不能真正发动起来并坚持下去。
    毛病找出来了，如何改进呢？
    首先，党、行政、工会、青年团进行了分工，决定工会以全力来领导红旗竞赛。其次，进行了全车间群众思想的调查、分类工作。在弄清了群众的基本思想情况之后，重新进行了竞赛的动员工作，反复讲解了竞赛的意义与目的，交代了竞赛的方式、方法，修改了竞赛的奖励办法。除此以外，在竞赛过程中还特别抓住了下列几个环节：
    制订作业计划组织竞赛
    在竞赛中抓住讨论、贯彻作业计划，有两大好处：
    第一，因为作业计划牵扯到每一个人，可以把全车间的人都发动起来。首先迫使车间干部必须去考虑下一阶段的生产安排问题，将生产数字、图纸、材料，交到各个生产小组。虽然那些数字还不准确，图纸、材料的供应还不能完全按时，但已经大大地减少了生产上的混乱现象，生产逐渐走向均衡，六月份的情况比五月份已有很大进步。
    第二，生产计划经过讨论之后，计划不再是个空数字，工人有了具体目标，有了完成计划的办法，再加上领导上比较能及时解决问题，工会加强政治教育，这就大大鼓舞了职工生产的积极性。
    但是，开始讨论、贯彻作业计划，并不是容易的，因为大家习惯了自由自在地生产，嫌作业计划麻烦。这时，工会即大力帮助各个生产小组算细账，具体地订计划。我们根据工具车间生产的特殊情况，决定在开始的时候，一个星期讨论一次作业计划。各个生产小组执行了一个星期的作业计划之后，认识到了作业计划的好处，往下再制订作业计划就顺利得多了。为了帮助贯彻作业计划，我们在车间里又设置了一幅生产进度表，大家下班时都在进度表前算细账：算一算计划完成了多少，那些没有完成。车间里还设立了窍门台，每个星期都有大量的窍门出现。工人何贵庄所提出的窍门，将铰刀的生产效率提高了二十倍，对全车间完成生产任务有重大的作用。
    做好小组思想工作
    为了使竞赛深入、持久地发展，工会纠正了前一阶段只有一般号召而不深入的缺点，选择重点，培养典型，做出样子来，让大家学习。工会以很大精力培养了刀具工段的谢清林小组。谢清林小组是一个车、铣、钳工联合的生产小组，全组有五个老师傅、十六个学徒。小组里的主要问题，是老师傅之间不团结。工会去帮助小组讨论五月份第一个星期的作业计划时，刚把数字摊开，老师傅、生产小组长邓祥根就说：“不可能完成。”生产组长说完不成，学徒更不敢发言，其他老师傅说：“生产组长说完不成，当然就完不成啰！”工会小组长谢清林看到大家的情绪不对头，也失去了信心。作业计划讨论不下去了。工会干部立即分头进行个别教育，特别加强对邓祥根和谢清林的教育，用算细账来加强他们完成计划的信心。邓祥根的思想开始打通了，但是大家不支持他。铣工师傅何贵庄说：“你能车得出来，我不铣，看你能完成生产任务？”这样，我们才看清楚这个小组内不团结的严重性，才全面地向小组普遍进行团结教育，指出由于闹不团结所造成的生产上的损失，同时加强对邓祥根的教育，指出他脾气暴躁的坏处。在教育有了成效的时候，召开了全组的团结会，邓祥根进行了自我批评，其他人也进行了自我批评。全组人在思想上一致起来了。
    谢清林小组团结了，生产上就迅速出现了成绩：五月初每周的产量是二百五十件，到六月中旬即提高到八百一十三件。一个半月只出了一件废品。在遵守劳动纪律和操作规程上也起到了模范作用。
    因为他们在生产上作出了显著的成绩，五月份车间里总结生产时，他们全组的车床、铣床上都插上了红旗，并受到了物质的奖励。谢清林小组的受奖，给予全车间各个生产小组很大的鼓舞。
    从培养谢清林小组的过程中，我们体会到：加强对生产小组长、工会小组长的教育，是非常重要的。因为，生产小组长、工会小组长都是技术比较好的，他们的言行对小组里的生产有着决定性的作用，如果小组长发动起来了，竞赛就会迅速地更深入地发展。
    我们加强对小组长的思想教育工作是从两方面进行的：
    首先是加强小组长的责任教育，鼓励他们自觉地动脑筋、想办法，发动大家去完成任务。以磨工小组为例：生产小组长普云曾提出“任务重，机器少，老师傅少，学徒多，怕完不成任务”，不愿干了。但普云是个积极分子，在这之前曾申请入党。我们就把他政治上的要求和小组里的生产情况结合起来进行教育，告诉他：“作为党员来要求自己，在困难面前应该是挺身而出，想办法战胜困难，小组长的责任就是带领全小组完成任务。”同时，帮助他分析、研究完成任务的有利条件，有那些困难，这些困难用些什么办法来克服，帮助他树立完成任务的信心。又如这个小组的工会组长朱大定，对完成任务信心不足，想依赖上级加人加机器，我们就去帮助他发动群众，告诉他：发动群众一切都会有办法的，而单纯依赖领导的思想却不对。两个小组长的思想通了，即领导全组动脑筋找窍门，最后任务完成得很好。现在，普云生产小组已是全车间比较先进的小组了。
    其次，是帮助各个小组长分析情况，解决具体问题，遇见了困难，帮助他们想办法克服。工会对各小组的具体帮助，主要的是抓住讨论作业计划，检查作业计划，帮助他们总结生产、研究情况。在这个帮助的过程中，和他们一起发动群众完成任务。这种具体帮助，使各个小组长在领导竞赛中，大胆而又充满着信心。
    由于加强了对小组长的教育，领导意图比较容易下达，因此使得整个车间的红旗竞赛进展很快，发展比较平衡，全车间工人的生产积极性很高。
    提高学徒的技术
    从培养谢清林小组的过程中，我们还体会到：必须把培养学徒列为红旗竞赛的主要内容之一。我们车间里的工人有一半是刚到厂三、四个月的学徒，要想完成今年繁重的生产任务，关键之一就是要迅速地培养学徒。
    在培养学徒的工作上，我们首先加强了对老师傅的教育，说明国家工业建设需要大量的人材，当前厂里繁重的生产任务也要求尽快地把学徒教育成正式工人，使他们树立了多带徒弟、迅速教会徒弟掌握技术的光荣思想。工会很注意解决一般老师傅最初存在的保守思想，并召开了交流培养学徒经验的座谈会。另方面，青年团则加强对学徒的教育，树立尊敬师傅、虚心积极学习技术的思想。在这两方面的教育工作做好之后，普遍订立了师徒合同。
    经过五月份至六月份的工作，绝大多数学徒都能上车单独操作，生产一般的产品了。许多老师傅都认真执行了“耐心培养学徒”的保证。当学徒刚上车时，免不了出废品，学徒心里很害怕，老师傅们就鼓励学徒说不要怕，并仔细地告诉学徒出废品的原因，指点着如何不出废品。整个车间的师徒关系都很融洽。
    我们工具车间的竞赛，经过了这一连串的工作，有了很大的进步。生产迅速提高，完成了生产任务，废品率降为百分之一点二，返工率降为百分之八。生产上的混乱现象逐步得到克服，加班加点的现象大为减少。
    在整个竞赛的过程中，我们体会到：转变领导作风是十分重要的，高喊口号的领导不能使竞赛深入，必须是踏踏实实，和群众一起研究问题，解决问题，说清道理，做出样子，反复耐心地教育群众，才能使竞赛逐步深入而持久。我们也认识到：竞赛的目的必须是为了完成国家计划，竞赛必须为全厂每一个时期的中心要求服务，如果我们工具车间不是为全厂新产品的试制、定型工作服务，盲目笼统地提出为完成产量、提高质量而竞赛，竞赛的效果一定是很差的。
