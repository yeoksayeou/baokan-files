Great progress has been made in the health services of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. At present, in addition to the fact that all 38 banners (counties) and 4 cities in the region have health clinics, the number of health stations established in various sumu (districts) has reached 178. There are more than 1,300 maternity and child health care and midwifery stations/groups, more than 2,000 medical personnel who have been separated from production, and more than 2,500 trained local doctors serving the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen. This strong health force has powerfully promoted the health movement. Now, the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have developed good hygiene habits. Agricultural areas pay great attention to environmental hygiene, actively building toilets and garbage cans, and receiving various preventive inoculations, and regularly sunning and washing clothes and bedding. The use of gauze covers on tableware and food has become a common phenomenon. In pastoral areas, some Mongolians have hung cloth linings on their bedding for the convenience of dismantling and washing their bedding to suit the nomadic life. Thanks to the development of the health movement, diseases have been decreasing year by year, and the population has begun to increase year by year. According to the Inner Mongolia government's population survey data in pastoral areas, the population of the Right Banner of Chen Barag in Hulunbuir League this year increased by 14% compared with 1949. The population of the Zhenglan Banner in Chahar League this year increased by 19% compared with 1949.

Before liberation, the Inner Mongolia region suffered from long-term cultural backwardness, economic poverty, and prevalent diseases due to the long-term oppression and barbarous plunder of the reactionary ruling class, and the population declined year by year. For example, the population of Xilin Gol League was 84,000 at the end of the Qing Dynasty, but it dropped to 36,000 in 1936. Judging from the age of the current population of the league, there are more elderly and middle-aged people and fewer young people. The most serious threat to the lives of the people of Inner Mongolia was venereal disease, which not only seriously damaged the reproductive capacity of the people of Inner Mongolia, but also caused many people to become disabled due to venereal disease. This tragic era is now over. Since its establishment, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been very concerned about the people's diseases. Since 1950, it has begun to focus on syphilis eradication work. After two years and nine months of effort, it completed a general survey of 13 banners under the jurisdiction of Xilin Gol, Chahar, and Hulunbuir Leagues, examining a total of more than 100,900 people and treating more than 44,000 patients, thereby restoring the reproductive capacity of many women. Ai Lima, a Mongolian woman from Solon Banner, had never given birth in her twenty years of marriage. After treatment for syphilis, she gave birth to a boy last year and was so happy that she considered him a treasure, telling everyone she met: "This was given by Chairman Mao."

In order to ensure the survival of infants, maternity and child health has also been widely promoted in various places. In addition to establishing more than 1,300 health care and midwifery stations/groups, more than 3,800 new and old midwives have been trained, new methods of midwifery and childcare have been promoted, and the old custom of allowing women to give birth on cow dung or grassland in pastoral areas has been changed.

In order to enable the health movement to be carried out more deeply and widely, governments at all levels in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have extensively used propagandists, reading groups, cultural centers, slideshows, wired broadcasts, film projection teams, and picture exhibitions to carry out health propaganda, and printed and distributed more than 80,000 propaganda posters and leaflets in Mongolian and Chinese, and more than 10,000 copies of disease prevention propaganda booklets. This has played a great role in further developing the health movement.

### 内蒙古自治区卫生事业获得很大发展

    内蒙古自治区卫生事业获得很大发展
    内蒙古自治区的卫生事业获得很大发展。现在全区除三十八个旗（县）和四个市都设有卫生院外，各苏木（区）设立的卫生所已有一百七十八处，有妇幼卫生保健接生站、组一千三百余处，有两千余名脱离生产的医务人员和两千五百余名经过训练的地方医生，在为广大农牧民服务。这支强大的卫生队伍有力地推动了卫生运动。现在内蒙古自治区的人民已养成了良好的卫生习惯。农业区都很注意环境卫生，积极修厕所、做垃圾箱，并接受各种预防注射，经常晒洗衣服被褥。食具、食物上设有纱罩已成普遍现象。游牧区有些蒙民为适应游牧生活拆洗被褥方便起见，在被褥上挂了布里。由于卫生运动的开展，疾病已逐年减少，人口开始逐年增多。根据内蒙政府牧区人口调查材料，呼纳盟的陈巴尔虎右翼旗今年人口比一九四九年增加了百分之十四。察哈尔盟的正蓝旗今年人口比一九四九年增加了百分之十九。
    内蒙古地区在解放前由于反动统治阶级的长期压迫和野蛮掠夺，长期文化落后、经济贫困、疾病流行，人口逐年下降。如锡林郭勒盟在清朝末年有人口八万四千，到一九三六年就下降到三万六千人。从该盟现有人口的年龄来看，老年人和中年人多，年龄小的很少。危害内蒙古人民生命最厉害的是性病，这种病不仅严重地破坏了内蒙古人民的生殖能力，并有很多人因害性病而成了残废。这种悲惨的时代现在已过去了。内蒙古自治区人民政府一成立，就十分关心人民的疾病。从一九五零年起即开始重点驱梅工作，经过两年零九个月的功夫，完成锡林郭勒、察哈尔、呼纳盟等三个盟所属十三个旗普查一遍的任务，先后共检查了十万九百多人，治疗了四万四千多个患者，因而使好多妇女恢复了生殖能力。索伦旗蒙古妇女爱利玛，结婚二十来年从未生育，经过治疗梅毒后在去年生了一个男孩，高兴得如获至宝，见人就说：“这是毛主席给的。”
    为了保证婴儿的成活，各地还广泛推行了妇幼卫生，除建立一千三百多个保健接生站、组外，还训练了三千八百多个新、旧接生员，推广了新法接生和育儿法，改变了过去牧区让产妇在牛粪或草地上分娩的旧习惯。
    内蒙古自治区所属各级政府为了使卫生运动更深入广泛地开展，曾大量利用宣传员、读报组、文化馆、幻灯、有线广播、电影放映队、图片展览等进行卫生宣传，并印发了蒙汉文对照的宣传画、传单八万多张，防疫宣传小册子一万多本。这对卫生运动的进一步开展起了很大作用。    （新华社）
