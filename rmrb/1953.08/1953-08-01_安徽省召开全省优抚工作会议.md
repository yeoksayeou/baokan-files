The Civil Affairs Department of the Anhui Provincial People's Government convened a provincial conference on preferential treatment work from July 15th to 22nd. The conference initially summarized the preferential treatment work in Anhui Province during the first half of 1953, studied the key points of work for the second half of the year, and, in the spirit of combating bureaucracy, made a realistic assessment of the achievements and shortcomings of past work, exchanged experiences from past work, and laid the foundation for further improving preferential treatment work in the future.

The conference listened to the report by Hu Keming, Director of the Provincial Bureau of Preferential Treatment, on the preliminary summary of preferential treatment work in the first half of 1953 and opinions on future work. He pointed out that the preferential treatment work in Anhui Province in the first half of this year has achieved considerable success under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government and the joint efforts of the broad masses of the people. During the Spring Festival support-the-army and give-preferential-treatment-to-military-families campaign, a warm tide of condolences to stationed troops, the sick and wounded, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families was set off in various places. Many county heads personally visited the families of martyrs and soldiers to offer festival greetings and condolences, further establishing a social atmosphere of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families. Regarding the work of plowing land on behalf of the martyrs' and soldiers' families and revolutionary disabled soldiers who lack labor, most areas on both sides of the Yangtze River have achieved labor-based burden-sharing of plowing duties on behalf of others at the township level and have promoted fixed plowing methods. In areas where mutual aid teams have a relatively good foundation, it has generally been achieved to "fix the task to households and combine it with teams," and in individual cases, the plowing land on behalf of others has been integrated into agricultural production cooperatives. The plowing work on behalf of others in Huainan and Huaibei was also focused on rectification this spring. Some villages with a good working foundation have adopted the method of contracting for plowing and production, thus effectively guaranteeing the yield of land belonging to martyrs' and soldiers' families. The peasant masses are very concerned about the land plowed on behalf of the martyrs' and soldiers' families. During the drought in June, farmer Guan Daofa put aside his own paddy fields and first filled the five mu of paddy fields plowed on behalf of others with water. The living standards of the martyrs' and soldiers' families have generally improved. In Santang Township, Liu'an County, more than 70 percent of the 42 martyrs' and soldiers' families have seen their living standards rise to the level of middle peasants, and 12 of them already have a lot of surplus grain. With the enthusiastic help of the masses, the martyrs' and soldiers' families have a high enthusiasm for production. More than 60 percent of the martyrs' and soldiers' families in the townships have participated in agricultural production, and 80 percent of the martyrs' and soldiers' families in areas with mutual aid teams have participated in mutual aid teams. The martyrs' and soldiers' families in the cities have also received good care. According to statistics from five provincial cities, the People's Government has helped the martyrs' and soldiers' families organize 69 production units. Bengbu City alone has organized 21 production groups, with 222 martyrs' and soldiers' families participating, with an average monthly income of 200,000 yuan per person, thus ensuring their livelihoods.

In terms of the resettlement work for soldiers in their hometowns (including disabled, demobilized, and transferred soldiers), great achievements have also been made. At present, about 95 percent of the soldiers in their hometowns have been properly resettled. Many soldiers in their hometowns have participated in organizations such as militia, peasant associations, and mutual aid teams, and have become the backbone of production. Many of them have been rated as models and elected as rural cadres who do not leave production.

However, judging from the preliminary inspection and exposure of materials in the anti-bureaucracy struggle, there are still many shortcomings and problems in the preferential treatment work in the first half of the year. Director Hu Keming said: The main shortcomings in the preferential treatment work are manifested in the following aspects:

1.  Some preferential treatment cadres lack due care and patient help for the martyrs' and soldiers' families and soldiers in their hometowns, and lack a responsible attitude to the end. Sometimes there are "push" and "drag" phenomena for problems that should be solved. In addition, the connection with relevant departments is not enough, so the employment problems and medical treatment problems or production difficulties of some martyrs' and soldiers' families and soldiers in their hometowns have not been able to be solved appropriately in a timely manner, and sometimes the solutions are very passive.
2.  The subjective requirements for work arrangements are high, not in line with reality, and the methods are not explained. For example, in the first half of this year, without considering the unbalanced development of plowing work on behalf of others in the province and the actual development of mutual aid teams, work arrangements were made, and the slogan of universally promoting the plowing method of "fixing the task to households and combining it with teams" was chanted in vain, and it was required that the yield of land plowed on behalf of others should generally increase by 10 percent compared with last year.
3.  Too much emphasis is placed on material preferential treatment for martyrs' and soldiers' families and soldiers in their hometowns, and there is a lack of ideological education. Some cadres think that as long as there is money in preferential treatment work, it will be easy to handle. Some cadres mistakenly believe that soldiers in their hometowns are "difficult to deal with," so they do not actively carry out management and education. At ordinary times, they do not pay attention to discovering model figures, and they lack regular education and training for those who have been elected as models, so as to establish a banner among the martyrs' and soldiers' families and soldiers in their hometowns.
4.  In terms of the distribution of preferential treatment funds, the situation is not understood, and the distribution is subjective, resulting in money not being used well. For example, when the Provincial Bureau of Preferential Treatment allocated disability allowances and education subsidies for the children of martyrs and soldiers, because it did not grasp the situation below, some were not enough and some could not be used up. The phenomenon of average distribution below is also very serious. The most prominent example is that a township in Lujiang County distributed the preferential treatment relief funds equally to the martyrs' and soldiers' families at 8,000 yuan per person.

In order to consolidate the achievements of preferential treatment work and better do preferential treatment work, Director Hu Keming believes that the following measures must be taken:

1.  It is necessary to promote the fixed plowing system on the basis of labor-based burden-sharing at the township level. Ninety percent of the martyrs', soldiers' families, and revolutionary disabled soldiers live in rural areas, and the main way to solve their difficulties in rural areas is to organize them to produce and plow land on their behalf. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to actively help them engage in agricultural and sideline production, participate in mutual aid teams, and help them find employment and establish families if they have employment conditions; on the other hand, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to plow land on their behalf if they need it, promote the fixed plowing system, guarantee the yield of their self-cultivated land and the land plowed on their behalf, and implement labor-based burden-sharing plowing duties at the township level to adjust the phenomenon of uneven burden.
2.  The organization of preferential treatment committees at the county, district, and township levels is a powerful assistant to the government in doing a good job in preferential treatment plowing work on behalf of others. At present, the organization in some places is only a formality and cannot play its due role. Therefore, in the inspection of preferential treatment work in various places, attention should be paid to improving the preferential treatment organization, absorbing relevant departments, martyrs' and soldiers' families, revolutionary disabled soldiers, preferential treatment workers, and activists in preferential treatment work to participate in the preferential treatment committee, establishing a regular inspection and reporting system, so that this organization can truly play its role.
3.  In preferential treatment work, always pay attention to discovering and cultivating model figures, establish a banner among the masses, pay attention to educating and helping the model figures who have emerged, improve their political awareness, so that they can better connect with the masses, unite the masses, and further do a good job in preferential treatment work.

The preferential treatment work cadres of various special districts, cities, and counties who participated in the meeting discussed this report. In the spirit of anti-bureaucracy, they made inspections in light of the actual situation of their regions, truthfully criticized the main shortcomings in the leadership of the Provincial Bureau of Preferential Treatment, and exchanged experiences from past work at the meeting. After the meeting, in order to strengthen the preferential treatment work throughout the province, the Anhui Provincial People's Government issued a notice on July 22, deciding to conduct an inspection of preferential treatment work throughout the province from "August 1st" to August 20th, summarize it in late August, and require all localities and departments to formulate feasible improvement measures for the future based on the problems found in the inspection.

### 安徽省召开全省优抚工作会议

    安徽省召开全省优抚工作会议
    安徽省人民政府民政厅于七月十五日至二十二日召开了全省优抚工作会议。初步总结了一九五三年上半年安徽省的优抚工作，研究了下半年的工作要点，本着反官僚主义的精神，实事求是地对已往工作的成绩与缺点作了适当的估计，交流了过去工作的经验，为今后进一步做好优抚工作打下了基础。
    会议听取了省优抚局局长胡克明关于一九五三年上半年优抚工作初步总结和今后工作意见的报告。他指出：安徽省今年上半年的优抚工作，在党和人民政府的正确领导和广大人民群众的共同努力下，已取得不少成绩。在春节拥军优属运动中，各地曾掀起了慰问驻军、伤病员、革命残废军人和革命烈士、革命军人家属的热潮，很多县长亲自到烈属、军属家贺节、慰问，进一步树立了拥军优属的社会风气。对于缺乏劳动力的烈、军属和革命残废军人代耕工作，长江两岸大部分地区已做到以乡为单位按劳负担代耕勤务，并推行了固定代耕办法。在互助组发展较有基础的地区，一般已做到“固定到户、结合到组”，个别的已把代耕土地结合到农业生产合作社里去。淮南、淮北的代耕工作，今春也进行了重点整顿。有些工作基础较好的乡村，更采用包耕包产的办法，因而有效地保证了烈、军属土地的产量。农民群众十分关怀烈、军属的代耕土地。六月间天旱时，农民关道法放下自己的水田，先把代耕的五亩稻田灌满水。烈、军属的生活已普遍提高。六安县三塘乡四十二户烈、军属中，生活水平上升为中农的占百分之七十以上，其中十二户已有许多余粮。在群众的热情帮助下，烈、军属的生产积极性很高。在乡烈、军属有百分之六十以上参加了农业生产，有互助组的地区百分之八十的烈、军属都参加了互助组。在城市中的烈、军属也同样得到很好的照顾。根据五个省辖市的统计，人民政府已帮助烈、军属组织了生产单位六十九个，蚌埠市就组织了二十一个生产组，参加的烈、军属有二百二十二人，平均每人每月可收入二十万元上下，因而生活得到保障。
    在对在乡军人（包括残废、复员、转业军人）的安置工作方面，也有很大成绩，目前百分之九十五左右的在乡军人，都得到了妥善安置，许多在乡军人参加了民兵、农会、互助组等组织，并成为生产中的骨干，其中有不少已被评为模范和被选为不脱离生产的乡村干部。
    但是，从反官僚主义斗争中初步检查和揭发的材料来看，上半年优抚工作的缺点和存在的问题还是很多的。胡克明局长说：优抚工作中存在的主要缺点表现在以下几个方面：
    一、部分优抚干部对烈、军属和在乡军人缺乏应有的爱护和耐心帮助，缺乏负责到底的精神，有时对应当解决的问题有“推”“拖”现象。再加与有关部门的联系不够，因此有的烈、军属和在乡军人的就业问题和疾病医疗问题或生产上的困难，就没有能够及时地加以适当解决，有时解决了也很被动。
    二、布置工作时主观要求高，不切合实际，不交代办法。如今年上半年不根据全省代耕工作发展不平衡的情况和互助组发展的实际情况，即进行工作布置，空喊普遍推行“固定到户，结合到组”的代耕办法，并要求代耕田产量一般比去年增产一成。
    三、对烈、军属及在乡军人偏重物质优待，缺乏思想教育，部分干部思想上认为搞优抚工作只要有钱，就好办事；有些干部错误地认为在乡军人“难缠”，因此不去积极地进行管理教育。平时又不注意发现模范人物，对已经当选为模范的也缺乏经常的教育培养，以便在烈、军属和在乡军人中树立旗帜。
    四、在发放优抚事业费方面，不了解情况，主观分配，结果是有钱没有用好。如省优抚局在拨发残废金和烈、军属子女入学补助费时，因为没有掌握下情，发下去后，有的不够，有的用不完。下面平均发放的现象也很严重。最突出的例子如庐江县一个乡把优抚救济款平均分发给烈、军属每人八千元。
    为了巩固优抚工作的成绩，更好地把优抚工作做好，胡克明局长认为必须采取以下几点办法：
    一、要在以乡为单位按劳负担的基础上推行固定代耕制。烈、军属及革命残废军人有百分之九十住在农村，而农村中解决他们困难的主要办法便是组织他们生产和为他们代耕。所以一面要积极帮助他们从事农业和副业生产，参加互助组，有就业条件的要帮助他们就业，建立家务；一面又要发动群众为他们需要代耕的进行代耕，推行固定代耕制，保证他们的自耕田地和代耕田地的产量，并实行以乡为单位按劳负担代耕勤务，调整负担中的畸轻畸重现象。
    二、县、区、乡优抚委员会的组织，是协助政府做好优抚代耕工作的有力助手，现在有些地方的这种组织空具形式，不能起它应有的作用。因此各地在检查优抚工作中，要注意健全优抚组织，吸收有关部门及烈、军属、革命残废军人、优抚工作人员和优抚工作中的积极分子参加优抚委员会，建立经常的检查汇报制度，使这一组织能真正发挥它的作用。
    三、在优抚工作中，经常注意发现和培养模范人物，在群众中树立旗帜，对已经涌现出来的模范人物，注意教育和帮助，提高他们的政治觉悟，使他们更好地联系群众，团结群众，进一步做好优抚工作。
    参加会议的各专署、市、县的优抚工作干部讨论了这个报告。大家本着反官僚主义的精神，结合本地区情况作了检查，实事求是地对省优抚局工作领导方面的主要缺点提出了批评，并在会上交换了过去工作的经验。会后，安徽省人民政府为了加强全省的优抚工作，曾于七月二十二日发出通知，决定从
    “八一”开始到八月二十日至，在全省范围内进行一次优抚工作的检查，八月下旬进行总结，并要求各地、各部门根据检查中发现的问题，订出今后切实可行的改进办法。
