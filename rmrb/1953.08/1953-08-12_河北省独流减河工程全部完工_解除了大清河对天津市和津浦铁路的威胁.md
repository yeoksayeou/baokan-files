The Duliujian River project in Hebei Province has been successfully completed at the end of July. The completion of the Duliujian River has completely eliminated the threat of flooding to Tianjin and the Jinpu Railway, and greatly reduced the flooding downstream of the Daqing River.

Hebei Province is located in the Yellow River Plain. Numerous small rivers flow out of the Taihang Mountains in the northwest and flow into the Daqing, Yongding, Ziya, Beiyun, and Nanyun rivers respectively. The five rivers converge near Tianjin and enter the Bohai Sea via the Hai River. The upstream sections of these rivers have steep slopes and rapid flows, while the downstream sections have gentle slopes and slow flows. Every year during the flood season, mountain torrents erupt, and the downstream sections cannot discharge the water in time, often causing floods. Among these five rivers, the Daqing River is the most harmful. The Daqing River has caused five major floods from 1911 to the present. In 1917 and 1939, floods twice directly rushed into Tianjin, with the water depth in the city reaching two to three meters, lasting for more than a month. During the flood in 1939, the property losses of the people of Tianjin amounted to more than 216 billion yuan in terms of Renminbi, and the Jinpu Railway was shut down for a month. The flooded area in the Hebei Plain southwest of Tianjin reached 4,400 square kilometers, and more than 121,200 houses collapsed.

In the second year after the establishment of the Central People's Government, it decided on the principle of thoroughly harnessing the Daqing River: building reservoirs upstream to store floodwater, dredging river channels in the midstream, and excavating the Duliujian River downstream. The Duliujian River project started construction on March 5, 1951. Over the course of more than two years, it used 21.73 million workdays. The entire project includes: starting from the Sixth Fort where the Daqing River and Ziya River meet, crossing the Nanyun River and the Jinpu Railway to the east, and intersecting the Machang Drainage River at Wanjia Wharf, a new 43-kilometer-long river channel was opened, namely the Duliujian River. At the entrance of the drainage river lies a reinforced concrete floodgate that is 130 meters long and 4.5 meters high. Through it, floodwater will be discharged along the drainage river to Dagang, and then slowly flow into the sea. With the Duliujian River and the Hai River jointly undertaking the flood discharge of the five rivers, the problem of the Daqing and Ziya rivers' floodwater entering the sea will be fundamentally solved. Because the Duliujian River flows from west to east, cutting off the Nanyun River flowing from south to north, a new river channel was opened west of Duliu Town, and a regulating gate and a ship lock were built, so that the Nanyun River could meet the Ziya River through the new river channel. In order to maintain the water source for navigation, irrigation, and drinking water downstream of the Nanyun River, a section of river channel was also opened near the Eleventh Fort of the Ziya River, and an intake gate was built to divert the water of the Nanyun River back to the old channel. This ensures that the interrupted Nanyun River remains navigable.

The Duliujian River project is another achievement of the working people of New China in engaging in peaceful construction and changing natural conditions. During the two years of construction, a labor army of 200,000 people worked happily here. They spent two severe winters and three sweltering summers, overcame various difficulties in the construction, and ensured the completion of the project on schedule.

After the completion of this project, in addition to ensuring the safety of Tianjin and the Jinpu Railway, the flood area downstream of the Daqing River will be limited to the area north of the Qianli Dike and west of the Ziya River; and the inundation time of the flooded area will also be shortened, and most of it can be planted with winter wheat.

    河北省独流减河工程全部完工
    解除了大清河对天津市和津浦铁路的威胁
    河北省独流减河工程已在七月底胜利完工。独流减河的完工，完全解除了天津市和津浦铁路的洪水威胁，并大大减轻了大清河下游水患。
    河北省地处黄河大平原，无数条小河从西北两面的太行山中流出，分别流入大清、永定、子牙、北运、南运等五条河。五条河在天津市附近汇流，经海河入渤海。这些河道上游坡陡流急，下游坡小流缓，每年汛期山洪暴发，下游宣泄不及，常常泛滥成灾。这五条河中以大清河为害最大。大清河从一九一一年到现在，就闹过五次大水灾。一九一七年和一九三九年，洪水两次直冲入天津，市内水深两三公尺，持续一个多月不退。一九三九年的那次水灾，天津全市人民的财产损失，折合人民币计算达二万一千六百多亿元，而且津浦铁路停车一月，天津西南的河北平原被淹面积达四千四百平方公里，倒房十二万一千二百多间。
    中央人民政府成立后第二年便决定了根治大清河的方针：上游建筑蓄洪水库，中游整理河道，下游开挖独流减河。独流减河工程从一九五一年三月五日开始施工以来，经历两年多，使用工数达二千一百七十三万个。全部工程包括：从大清河和子牙河会流处的第六堡为起点，东穿南运河、津浦铁路，到万家码头与马厂减河相交，新开了一条四十三公里长的河道，即独流减河。减河的入口处横卧着一座长一百三十公尺、高四点五公尺的钢筋混凝土的进洪闸。通过它，洪水将顺着减河宣泄到大港，然后慢流入海。有独流减河和海河共同承泄五河的洪水，大清、子牙两河洪水的入海问题便根本解决了。由于独流减河由西往东流，横断了由南往北流的南运河，所以在独流镇西面开了一条新河道，并建筑了节制闸和船闸，使南运河经新河道和子牙河会流。为保持南运河下游航运、灌溉及饮水的水源，又在子牙河十一堡附近开了一段河道和修了一座进水闸，把南运河水引归旧道。这样就保证了被切断的南运河航行无阻。
    独流减河工程，是新中国劳动人民从事和平建设，改变自然条件的又一成就。在施工的两年多中，前后有二十万人的劳动大军在这儿愉快地劳动着。他们度过了两个严冬和三个酷暑，克服了施工中的各种困难，保证工程如期完成。
    这一工程完成后，除天津市和津浦铁路的安全可以保证外，大清河下游泛滥区域将仅限于千里堤以北和子牙河以西地区；且泛滥区域的浸水时间也将缩短，大部可以播种冬麦。
