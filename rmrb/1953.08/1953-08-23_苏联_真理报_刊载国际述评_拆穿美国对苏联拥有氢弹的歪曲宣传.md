    Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd, Moscow dispatch: The Soviet "Pravda" published an international commentary on August 21st written by F. Orekhov, which discussed the reaction of the American bloc and its newspapers to the Soviet Union's possession of the hydrogen bomb.

    Orekhov wrote: The enthusiastic response in international opinion to the speech given by G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, demonstrates that his speech expressed the thoughts and feelings of millions of people around the world, expressing their belief that peaceful resolution of international disputes is not only necessary but also possible. Even in the United States, clear-headed voices can be heard expressing support for the argument that peaceful coexistence between two different economic and social systems is possible and necessary. At the same time, the newspapers and magazines recognized as mouthpieces of the extremist aggressive groups in the United States commented almost exclusively on that part of Malenkov's speech concerning the fact that the United States is no longer a monopolist in the production of hydrogen bombs.

    Orekhov then pointed out: The aggressive groups, which previously relied on the American atomic bomb monopoly and later on the American hydrogen bomb monopoly as the basis of their policy, are clearly afraid that the Soviet Union's possession of hydrogen weapons will be regarded by the world as proof of the strengthening of Soviet power. Apparently, for this reason, certain American leaders have undertaken a somewhat thankless and futile endeavor, trying to minimize the importance of the Soviet government leader's statement on hydrogen weapons. At the same time, they are intensifying a frantic campaign to incite hatred of the Soviet Union through their propaganda machine, making it seem as if consultation with the Soviet Union will not succeed, and they are using the fact that the Soviet Union has mastered the secrets of atomic and hydrogen weapon production to frighten the people, thereby causing panic in order to create a favorable atmosphere for intensifying the arms race.

    Orekhov said: The Soviet government's announcement on the 20th regarding the Soviet hydrogen bomb test gave a fatal blow to this kind of intimidation, telling the people of all countries that there is absolutely no need to panic about the Soviet Union's possession of hydrogen weapons. The Soviet government's announcement once again reflected the general line of Soviet foreign policy mentioned in G.M. Malenkov's speech, which is the line of consolidating world peace and ensuring the security of all countries, which is unanimously supported and endorsed by the people of the world.

### 苏联“真理报”刊载国际述评  拆穿美国对苏联拥有氢弹的歪曲宣传

    苏联“真理报”刊载国际述评
    拆穿美国对苏联拥有氢弹的歪曲宣传
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”二十一日刊载了弗·奥列霍夫所写的国际述评，其中谈到美国集团及其报纸对苏联拥有氢弹一事的反应。
    奥列霍夫写道：苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上的演说在各国舆论中所引起的热烈反应，说明他的演说表达了全世界千百万人民的思想和感情，表达了他们的信念：用和平方法解决国际争端不但是必要的而且是可能的。甚至在美国，也可以听到清醒的声音，它们表明支持两种不同的经济和社会制度有可能有必要和平共处的论点。与此同时，被公认为美国极端侵略集团的喉舌的报章杂志所评论的，几乎尽是马林科夫演说中关于美国已不再是氢弹生产方面的垄断者的那一部分。
    奥列霍夫接着指出：从前以美国的原子弹垄断、后来又以美国的氢弹垄断作为他们的政策的依靠的侵略集团，显然害怕苏联拥有氢武器会被全世界认为是苏联力量增强的证明。显然是为了这个原故，某些美国领导人物承担下了多少是费力不讨好的冒险工作，他们力图尽量缩小苏联政府首长关于氢武器的声明的重要性。同时，他们又通过他们的宣传机器加紧进行煽动仇恨苏联的疯狂运动，它们把事情说成好像是：和苏联协商是不会成功的，它们正以苏联掌握了原子武器和氢武器生产秘密这个事实来恫吓人民，从而引起惊慌，以便为加紧进行军备竞赛制造有利的空气。
    奥列霍夫说：苏联政府二十日发表的关于苏联氢弹试验的公告，给了这种恫吓以致命的打击，告诉世界各国人民对于苏联拥有氢武器一事完全不必感到惊慌。苏联政府的公告再次反映了格·马·马林科夫演说中所谈到的苏联对外政策的总路线，这就是受到全世界人民一致支持和拥护的巩固世界和平与确保各国安全的路线。
