    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters convened its 20th Enlarged Council Meeting on the 7th to discuss the decisions of the Third National Work Conference of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. They also welcomed the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters delegation that had just returned from the Soviet Union. Present at the meeting were council members in Beijing, including Li Dequan, Chen Qiyuan, Liang Xi, Cao Jinghua, as well as Deputy Secretaries-General Yan Baohang, Luo Shuzhang, and council members Qu Wu, Ma Yanxiang, and others. Representatives from organizations such as the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, the All-China Students’ Federation, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives also attended the meeting, along with all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters delegation to the Soviet Union. Sokolov, representative of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, also attended the meeting.
    Secretary-General Qian Junrui reported on the key points and spirit of the decisions made at the Third National Work Conference of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. He pointed out that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should vigorously strengthen the propaganda work of Sino-Soviet friendship and the introduction of the Soviet Union, and reduce the cumbersome organizational affairs of developing individual memberships in the past. It should unite and work through various people's organizations and relevant parties to carry out the work of promoting Sino-Soviet friendship and introducing the Soviet Union. To this end, the Council of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters decided to expand on the existing basis, with responsible persons from relevant people's organizations participating in the Council of the Headquarters to strengthen the connection between the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and various people's organizations, thereby developing Sino-Soviet friendship work. Li Furen, the head of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters delegation to the Soviet Union, reported on the visit to the Soviet Union and his impressions at the meeting. The council members unanimously agreed with the two reports by Secretary-General Qian Junrui on the decisions of the Third National Work Conference of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and by Head of Delegation Li Furen on his impressions of the visit to the Soviet Union.
