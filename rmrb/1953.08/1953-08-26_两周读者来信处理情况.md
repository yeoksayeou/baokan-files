Reader Letters Summary

    Two-Week Report on Handling Reader Letters
    From August 3rd to August 16th, the Reader Letters Group of this newspaper received a total of 2,687 reader letters, and various agencies responded to 612 reader letters. Among them, 1,225 were related to political and legal issues, 1,094 were related to industrial and agricultural production and financial issues, 938 were related to cultural and educational issues, and 42 were of other nature. 144 were published in the newspaper, 834 were individually answered to the readers, 1,156 were forwarded to relevant agencies for investigation, reference, handling, and response, and 1,041 were retained by this newspaper for reference or did not require further processing; some of these letters were left over from before. In these two weeks, the Reader Letters Group of this newspaper sent out a total of 3,595 letters answering readers, forwarding them to various agencies for investigation and handling, and urging them to respond.
    Some of the reader letters received in the past two weeks reflect the lax work discipline in some government agencies, and suggest that relevant agencies strengthen ideological education for staff and establish some necessary systems to improve this situation. We are preparing to study this issue, and hope that readers from all over the country—especially staff members of government agencies—will continue to send letters reflecting relevant materials in this regard.
    Many readers continue to send letters reflecting some wasteful phenomena in timber processing, allocation, and use. Many readers also send letters exposing the accumulation, misdelivery of letters, and loss of remittances in the mail delivery work of certain postal institutions. We have selected some of these letters for publication in the newspaper, and the rest have been forwarded to relevant agencies for individual processing. We are studying readers' letters exposing the failure of certain shipping units to attach importance to railway planned transportation and the waste of railway transportation capacity, and are preparing to select some for publication.
    Reader letters reflect that the early rice harvest in the southern provinces is abundant this year, and grain companies in various places have generally established purchasing stations to facilitate farmers; however, some purchasing stations have serious "bureaucratic styles" in their work, and the purchasing procedures are too complicated, which makes farmers feel very inconvenienced. Farmers in Dazu County, Sichuan Province, wrote to reflect the situation in which the People's Government assisted them in solving the problem of selling the local specialty—wild *gaozi* (an oil material that can be used to make umbrellas, etc.). We hope that readers will continue to send letters reflecting various aspects of grain purchase and local specialty sales so that they can be centrally studied and published in the newspaper. We are studying readers' letters reflecting that the Shanghai Industrial Products Wholesale Station of the National Cooperative Federation cannot meet the needs of lower-level cooperatives when allocating goods, and that some rural areas in North China and East China lack fertilizer (soybean cake, fertilizer powder).
    We have also received some letters from readers reflecting the lack of preparation and planning by certain leading organs for the distribution of graduates from schools at all levels, and we are preparing to publish abstracts. Many readers have written letters reflecting the chaotic phenomena in school teaching and administrative work, most of which lack specific facts or are not specific enough. Some, although they raised some specific facts, did not explain the time and background of the chaotic phenomena. Therefore, in addition to replying to the readers of the above letters to supplement the situation, we also hope that readers who write letters in the future will pay attention to stating the facts and the reasons for their occurrence, etc.

    两周读者来信处理情况
    八月三日到十六日两周中，本报读者来信组共收到读者来信二千六百八十七件，各机关答复读者的信六百十二件。其中有关政法问题的一千二百二十五件，有关工农业生产和财经问题的一千零九十四件，有关文教问题的九百三十八件，其它性质的四十二件。在报上发表的一百四十四件，个别答复读者的八百三十四件，转请各有关机关调查、参考、处理和答复的一千一百五十六件，留存本报参考或不需再作处理的一千零四十一件；这些来信中有一部分是以前留下的。在这两周中，本报读者来信组共发出答复读者、转请各机关调查处理和催办信三千五百九十五件。
    两周中收到的一些读者来信，反映某些政府机关工作纪律松弛的情况，并建议各有关机关对工作人员加强思想教育和建立一些必要的制度，以改进这种情况。我们准备对这个问题进行研究，希望各地读者——尤其是机关工作人员继续来信反映有关这方面的材料。
    不少读者继续来信反映木材加工、调拨和使用中的一些浪费现象，还有不少读者来信揭发某些邮政机构在信件投递工作中积压、错投信件和丢失汇款等现象。这些来信，我们已经选择一部分在报上发表，其余的即转请各有关机关个别处理。读者揭发某些托运单位不重视铁路计划运输及浪费铁路运输力等情况的来信，我们正在研究，准备选择一部分发表。
    读者来信反映：目前南方各省早稻丰收，各地粮食公司为了便利农民，普遍设立收购站；但有些收购站工作中有严重“衙门作风”，收购手续过于繁复，使农民极感不便。四川大足县农民来信反映了人民政府协助他们解决了当地特产——野生槔子
    （可作制伞等用的油料）销售问题的情况。我们希望读者继续来信反映粮食收购和土产销售工作中各方面的情况，以便集中研究后在报上发表。读者反映全国合作总社上海工业品批发站调拨货品时不能满足下级合作社需要以及华北、华东某些农村肥料
    （豆饼、肥田粉）缺乏等情况的来信，我们正在进行研究。
    我们还收到一些读者反映某些领导机关对各级学校毕业生分配工作问题缺乏准备和计划的来信，准备摘要发表。有不少读者反映学校教学行政工作中混乱现象的来信，其中大多缺少具体事实或交代得不具体，有些虽然提出了一些具体事实但没有说明发生混乱现象的时间和背景。因此，我们除已复信请上述来信的读者补充情况外，并希望今后来信的读者注意写明事实及其发生的原因等。
