    Vyshinsky Refutes the Untenable Arguments of US and British Representatives at the 26th Meeting of the UN General Assembly's Political Committee

    According to Xinhua News Agency: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued its meeting on the morning of the 26th to begin discussing the various proposals concerning the Korean question submitted to the Political Committee for consideration.

    The Soviet delegation proposed an amendment to the fifteen-nation proposal led by the United States, suggesting that the political conference be composed of the following members: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, South Korea, Indonesia, Syria, Egypt, Mexico, and Burma.

    The Soviet delegation also suggested removing the additional condition from the proposal to invite the Soviet Union to the meeting, namely, that the Soviet Union should only be invited if the "other party" is willing.

    Representatives of Poland and Czechoslovakia spoke in support of the Soviet proposal and the Soviet delegation's amendment to the fifteen-nation proposal, and stated that they would vote against the fifteen-nation proposal.

    Representatives of the United States, Britain, and other countries opposed the revised Soviet proposal and the Soviet delegation's amendment to the fifteen-nation proposal. US Representative Lodge continued to insist on the attitude of holding a "both sides" conference.

    The vast majority of representatives who spoke at today's meeting, including representatives from Liberia, Guatemala, and Yugoslavia, supported the proposal to invite the Soviet Union and India to participate in the political conference.

    Before the end of the meeting, A.Y. Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, spoke, stating that the fifteen-nation proposal and the opinions against the Soviet proposal were untenable.

    [Xinhua News Agency, August 29th] (TASS, New York, August 29th): At the August 26th meeting of the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, A.Y. Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, spoke, refuting the untenable arguments put forward by representatives of Britain, the United States, and other countries, who attempted to use these arguments to oppose the Soviet delegation’s proposal regarding the composition of the political conference to discuss the Korean question.

    Vyshinsky, in replying to the British representative, mentioned the ambiguous attitude of the British delegation. He said: The British delegation has to resort to tricks, even at the cost of distorting the truth. For example, the British representative Jebb unexpectedly said that the Soviet proposal stipulates that only three countries out of the sixteen participating countries should participate in the political conference, while in reality, the Soviet proposal advocates the participation of four countries.

    Vyshinsky said that the number of countries participating in the political conference should not be too large. At the same time, the various countries of the belligerent parties as well as other countries concerned about a peaceful resolution of the Korean question must send representatives to participate in this conference.

    Vyshinsky reiterated that the political conference should not be held only by representatives of both sides, but should take the form of a round table conference. Therefore, a clear number of seats must also be stipulated for neutral countries.

    Vyshinsky referred to the speech of the representative of the Peruvian delegation (who was supported by the US representative), who tried to prove that the United Nations General Assembly should not seriously consider the opinions of the two governments—the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Vyshinsky said: The US delegation, the leader of the countries proposing the fifteen-nation proposal, believes that it is superfluous to hold negotiations with the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the composition of the political conference, and that it is quite appropriate to simply notify the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of the decision of the United Nations General Assembly, without caring about the opinions of the two governments regarding this decision. This is like an ultimatum.

    Vyshinsky referred to the conditions put forward in Zhou Enlai's statement that must be created to ensure the success of the political conference, saying: Obviously, the path that the countries proposing the fifteen-nation proposal want to take is completely different. From the statements made by Lodge and some other countries proposing the fifteen-nation proposal, it can be seen that they believe it is not necessary to negotiate with the other party, thus closing the door to the possibility of such negotiations.

    One should not force the heroic Korean people and the government of the great Chinese people to accept conditions, as the fifteen-nation group is trying to do in the matter of the composition of the political conference to discuss the Korean question. The word "order" can only be used to talk to defeated countries, but North Korea still stands today in the same place where it was when it was attacked by the Li Chengwan bandit gang in 1950.

    Vyshinsky further pointed out that it is wrong, and in fact harmful, for the delegations of the countries proposing the fifteen-nation proposal to oppose the following opinion: that the Secretary-General of the United Nations should notify the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of the decisions of the United Nations General Assembly meetings on the Korean question and all relevant materials and suggestions presented at the meetings, and submit a report to the General Assembly on their opinions on the work done by the General Assembly at this meeting.

    Speaking of the Soviet delegation's attitude towards South Korea, Vyshinsky said: I must remind you that our attitude towards South Korea is based on one of the most important principles of our foreign policy, which is that South Korea, like North Korea, must participate in the political conference and as a key member of the conference.

    Vyshinsky concluded by saying that we are convinced that no matter what resolution the General Assembly passes that closes the door to future negotiations, negotiations will still take place here or there, in different forms. It is impossible to kick negotiations aside, because we believe that millions of men and women, we can say, all of humanity, are watching the danger of the resumption of the Korean War with indignation and horror, and are eager to eradicate this war, thereby avoiding the threat of another world war that would be a great disaster for all people, for all mankind.

    维辛斯基在联大政治委员会二十六日会议上
    驳斥美英等国代表的无理论据
    据新华社讯：联合国大会政治委员会二十六日上午继续举行会议，开始讨论提交政治委员会审议的关于朝鲜问题的各项提案。
    苏联代表团对以美国为首的十五国提案提出一个修正案，建议政治会议由下列成员组成：美国、英国、法国、苏联、中华人民共和国、印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、南朝鲜、印度尼西亚、叙利亚、埃及、墨西哥和缅甸。
    苏联代表团同时建议，从关于邀请苏联参加会议的提案中，把所谓只有在“对方”愿意的条件下苏联才可被邀请这一附加条件删去。
    波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表发言支持苏联提案及苏联对十五国提案的修正案，并表示将投票反对十五国提案。
    美、英及其他一些国家的代表反对修改后的苏联提案和苏联代表团对十五国提案的修正案。美国代表洛奇继续坚持主张召开“双方”会议的态度。
    在今天会议上发言的绝大多数代表，包括利比里亚、危地马拉和南斯拉夫三国代表在内，支持主张邀请苏联和印度参加政治会议的提案。
    会议结束前，苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基发言，他说明十五国提案以及反对苏联提案的意见都是站不住脚的。
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：在联合国大会政治委员会八月二十六日的会议上，苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基发言驳斥英国、美国以及其它国家的代表所提出的无理论据，这些国家的代表企图用这些论据来反对苏联代表团关于讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议的成员的主张。
    维辛斯基在回答英国代表时提到英国代表团的暧昧态度。他说：英国代表团不得不玩弄花样，甚至不惜歪曲事情的真相。譬如英国代表杰伯就曾出人意外地说，苏联提案规定在十六个参战国家中，只有三个国家应该参加政治会议，而实际上苏联提案主张的是四个国家参加。
    维辛斯基说，参加政治会议的国家不应过多。同时，交战双方各国以及关心和平解决朝鲜问题的其它国家必须派代表参加这个会议。
    维辛斯基重申，政治会议不应该只由双方的代表举行，而应该是采取圆桌会议的形式。因此，也必须为中立国的席次规定一个明确的数目。
    维辛斯基提到了秘鲁代表团代表（他得到美国代表的支持）的发言，这位代表力图证明联合国大会丝毫不应该慎重处理两国政府——中华人民共和国政府以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府——的意见。维辛斯基说：十五国提案提出国的领袖美国代表团认为与中华人民共和国政府以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府就政治会议组成事宜举行谈判是多余的，认为只是以联合国大会的决定通知中华人民共和国政府以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府就已十分得体了，不必再关心两国政府对于这个决定的意见。这像是最后通牒一样。
    维辛斯基提到了周恩来的声明中提出的、为了保证政治会议成功所必须创造的条件，他说：显然，十五国提案的提出国所想走的道路是完全不同的。由洛奇和十五国提案的其他一些提出国发表的声明看出，他们认为没有必要与对方谈判，因此关上了可能进行这种谈判的大门。
    不应该强使英勇的朝鲜人民和伟大的中国人民的政府接受条件，像十五国集团在讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议的组成问题上所要做的一样。命令的字眼只能用来对战败国谈话，但是北朝鲜今天仍然屹立在一九五○年遭受李承晚匪帮进攻时的原来地方。
    维辛斯基进一步指出，像十五国提案提出国代表团这样，反对以下的意见是不对的，而且实际上是有害的，这个意见是：请联合国秘书长把联合国大会会议关于朝鲜问题的决定和会上提出的一切有关材料和建议通知中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，并就它们对大会这次会议所做的工作的意见向大会提出报告。
    谈到苏联代表团对南朝鲜的态度时，维辛斯基说：我必须提醒诸位，我们对南朝鲜的态度是根据我们外交政策中的一条最重要原则，这就是南朝鲜像北朝鲜一样必须参加政治会议、而且作为会议的主要成员的原则。
    维辛斯基最后说，我们深信，无论大会通过什么关闭未来谈判之门的决议，谈判还是会在这里或那里、在不同的形式下照样举行的。一脚踢开谈判是不可能的，因为我们相信，千百万男女，我们可以说，全人类都以愤慨和恐怖的心情注视着朝鲜战争复起的危险，并且急切希望根除这次战争，从而免除对于所有人民、对于全人类都会是极大灾难的另
    一次世界大战的威胁。
