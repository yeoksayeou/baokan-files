The Yao People are Laughing
	Qiu Feng

	In the Yao Mountain valley bordering Guizhou and Guangxi provinces, one hundred *li* away from Libo County in Guizhou Province, live 161 hard-working, brave, and simple Yao households.

	Like other ethnic minorities, this ethnic group in the past "suffered the hardship of cattle and horses and ate the food of livestock," living a miserable life for a long time. The Kuomintang reactionaries often conscripted soldiers, levied funds, plundered, and killed here, forcing these kind people to flee to mountain caves. "Yao Ge Cha, Na Ge Liu, Bai Ge Liu!" (meaning the Yao family suffers, eating here, sleeping here!) This popular proverb is a true description of the life of the Yao people at that time.

	Liberation came, and Chairman Mao's brilliance shone on the Yao Mountains, bringing joy and happiness to the Yao people. On April 29th this year, the Bai Ku Yao Autonomous Region People's Government of Gu Lei Township was established. Under the leadership of their own government, the Yao people are increasingly moving towards prosperity and happiness. This spring, the mountains and forests were covered with green leaves, and the Zhang River quietly flowed through the valley. Clusters of new thatched huts built on the hillside have decorated the Yao Mountains even more beautifully. The Yao people live peacefully and work happily. They sing to their heart's content:

	The sun shines on the Yao Mountains,
	The sun warms the hearts of the Yao people,
	Bringing light and youth,
	Eternal freedom and joy.

	The Zhang River flows endlessly,
	Chairman Mao's kindness is greater than the stars,
	Endless to say, countless to count,
	Countless to count, endless to say.

	In the past three years, the production and life of the Yao people have changed. Under the leadership of the People's Government, they have land, houses, and farm animals. Production tools have also been initially improved, and the backward production methods of "broadcasting and thin harvesting" and "slash-and-burn cultivation" have been changed. Poor peasant Luo Boqing said: "Before liberation, the Yao family did not dare to raise cattle for fear of being snatched away by the Kuomintang. There was a lack of fertilizer for planting crops, and only two or three loads of fertilizer were applied to a field, or even none at all. This year, the amount of fertilizer applied to the fields has more than doubled." The Yao farmers used wooden plows to cultivate in the past, without turning shovels or hoes, and production efficiency was very low. This year, the People's Government distributed a large number of agricultural loans and 3,807 pieces of free agricultural tools to the Yao Autonomous Region, averaging four agricultural tools per person, one and a half pigs per household. The entire autonomous region has increased to 670 cattle, enough for the Yao people to use for production. The People's Government has set up technical training classes for water conservancy and cotton, cultivating technical personnel for the Yao people and imparting production experience. The cultivated land has also increased. Poor peasant Luo Boqing's production income increased from eight loads to sixteen loads. He Lao Jiu's field also doubled its yield. This year, the Yao people of the Autonomous Region responded to the call of the People's Government for patriotic production increase, organized mutual aid groups, and formulated patriotic production increase plans. The green grass all over the mountains and fields was cut to make fertilizer, and more than 50 *mu* of wasteland was reclaimed to plant corn and cotton.

	With the increase in production, the life of the Yao people has been improved. Poor peasant He Lao Di, a family of six, rarely ate salt in the past, but now the whole family can eat two *jin* a month. In the past, the average person in the entire autonomous region could not eat even two *liang* of rice a day, but now everyone can eat half a *jin*. New houses have been built on the hillside, with an average of one mosquito net for every two people. The days of living in caves and roasting fire overnight are gone forever. Last September, the People's Government also established a primary school here, educating more than 90 Yao children, and illiterate adults also entered literacy classes.

	Faced with this happy life, in the Yao Mountain valley, in the Bai Ku Yao Autonomous Region, on the lush hillside, and in the verdant fields, the Yao people sang songs of gratitude:

	The Yao family's suffering is like an abyss,
	Living in caves without seeing the sun;
	The reactionaries locked up our feet,
	Chairman Mao unlocked the lock!

	The reactionaries drove the Yao family up the mountain,
	Chairman Mao brought the Yao family down;
	The reactionaries locked up our feet,
	Chairman Mao unlocked the lock!

	Under the shining light of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy, there has been unprecedented love and unity among all ethnic groups. Last December, when Dongmeng Yao suffered a fire, Luo Laobao, the Yi village chief of Lao Village Five Village, immediately mobilized the masses, sent representatives to express condolences, and gave the Yao people 849 *jin* of rice, 115 *jin* of corn, 20 *jin* of salt, 130,000 yuan of RMB, as well as clothing and furniture. During the spring plowing season this year, the Yao people who had newly acquired land were not good at farming, so Yi farmers He Zhengqing and Li Zisheng taught Yao people He Lao Di, Wei Lao Min, and others how to plow the fields. In order to save time carrying fertilizer up and down the mountain, the Yao and Yi people living on the mountain and down the mountain exchanged fertilizer with each other.

    瑶族人民在欢笑
    仇风
    在贵州和广西两省交界的地方，距贵州省荔波县城一百华里远的瑶山峡谷，聚居着一百六十一户勤劳、勇敢、朴实的瑶族人民。
    这个民族也同其他少数民族一样，在过去“受的牛马苦，吃的牲畜食”，长期过着悲惨的生活。国民党反动派经常在这里抓兵、派款、掠夺和杀害，迫使这些善良的人民逃居在高山岩洞里。“瑶格岔，那格流，白格流。”（意即瑶家苦，吃在这，睡在这哪！）这首流行的谚语，就是当时瑶族人民生活的真实描述。
    解放了，毛主席的光辉照亮了瑶山，给瑶族人民带来了喜悦和幸福。今年四月二十九日姑类乡白裤瑶族自治区人民政府成立了，瑶族人民在自己政府的领导下，日益走向繁荣和幸福。今年春天，群山丛林披起了绿叶，漳河水静静地流过峡谷，山坡上盖起的一簇簇的新茅屋，把瑶山装饰得更加美丽了。瑶族人民在恬静地生活着，愉快地劳动着。他们在尽情地歌唱：
    太阳照亮了瑶山，
    太阳照暖了瑶族的心，
    带来了光明和青春，
    永恒地自由和快乐。
    漳河水呀流不尽，
    毛主席恩赛天星，
    说不尽呀数不清，
    数不清呀说不尽。
    三年来瑶族人民在生产和生活上都变了样。在人民政府的领导下，他们有了田地、房屋和耕畜。生产工具也有初步的改进，过去“广播薄收”、“刀耕火种”的落后生产方式得到了改变。贫农罗伯清说：“解放前瑶家不敢喂牛，害怕国民党抢走。种庄稼缺少肥料，一挑田只放二、三挑肥，甚至不放；今年田里上的肥料增加了一倍多。”瑶族农民从前使用木犁耕种，没有翻锹、锄头，生产效率很低。今年人民政府在瑶族自治区发放了大批农业贷款和无偿农具三千八百零七件，平均每人有四件农具，每户养猪一口半，全自治区耕牛已增到六百七十头，足够瑶族人民生产之用。人民政府开办的水利、棉花等技术训练班，给瑶族人民培养了技术人材，传授生产经验。耕地也增加了。贫农罗伯清生产收入从八挑增加到十六挑。何老九的田也增产一倍。今年自治区瑶族人民响应了人民政府爱国增产的号召，组织了互助组，订出了爱国增产计划，满山遍野的青草割来做成肥料，开出的五十多亩荒地种上了苞谷和棉花。
    随着生产的提高，瑶族人民的生活得到了改善。贫农何老弟，全家六口，从前很少吃盐巴，现在全家每月能吃上两斤。全自治区过去每人平均每天吃不到二两大米，现在每人可能吃上半斤。山坡上修起了新屋，平均两人有一床蚊帐，过去聚居岩洞烤火过夜的日子一去不复返了。去年九月人民政府还在这里成立了一所小学，教育着九十多个瑶族儿童，不识字的成年人也进了识字班。
    面对着这种幸福的生活，在瑶山峡谷，在白裤瑶族自治区，在茂林的山坡上，在青葱的田野里，瑶族人民唱出了感激的歌声：
    瑶家苦头如深渊，
    不见天日住岩洞；
    反动派把我们脚儿锁起来，
    毛主席把锁来开！
    反动派把瑶家赶上山，
    毛主席把瑶家接下来；
    反动派把我们脚儿锁起来，
    毛主席把锁来开！
    在毛主席的民族政策的光辉照耀下，各民族之间出现了空前的友爱和团结。去年十二月间董蒙瑶族失火，捞村五村彝族村长罗老保立刻发动群众，派代表前去慰问，并送给瑶族大米八百四十九斤，苞谷一百一十五斤，盐巴二十斤，人民币十三万元以及衣物家具等。今年春耕期中，新分得土地的瑶族人民不善于耕作，彝族农民何正清、李自生就教会了瑶族何老弟、韦老民等犁田。为了节省山上山下挑肥时间，住在山上和山下的瑶、彝两族人民实行了互相换肥。
