People's Representative of Xinqiao Village, Jiangjin County, Actively Leads the Masses in Fighting Drought

The Shuanglong Township of Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, completed its general election on June 5th. Xia Zhiqing, the newly elected representative of Xinqiao Village in the township, has been actively leading the masses in fighting drought, and has been praised by the people.

The former people's representative of Xinqiao Village, Zhao Tianlin, relaxed his leadership during the drought last year, resulting in reduced crop production, which greatly displeased the masses. Zhao Tianlin also performed poorly in other work. After returning from studies in the county this spring, he did not convey the county's spring plowing production tasks and the introduced experience in increasing rice production to the masses. Usually, he acted arbitrarily, rarely discussing issues with cadres and the masses, and was indifferent to the production and lives of the masses. In June of this year, Shuanglong Township conducted grassroots elections, and the masses of Xinqiao Village carefully elected Communist Party member Xia Zhiqing as their representative. In the second half of June, the land was dry and the sky was arid, and 80 percent of the paddy fields in Xinqiao Village were completely dry, which caused the masses to be very uneasy. There was a stream of water flowing out of the coal mine in Xinqiao Village, and in the past, the masses often had disputes over water usage. In order to fight the drought and solve the water problem, Xia Zhiqing went deep into the masses and discussed with them a reasonable way to use this water source. Farmers such as Ou Zhibin saw that Xia Zhiqing took the initiative to discuss with them, which was different from Zhao Tianlin's style, so they said to Xia Zhiqing: If this water is not wasted, it can irrigate the fields of four groups. To do this, we must first do a good job in management and not allow anyone to monopolize it. Fields that should get water should be watered; fields that cannot get water should not be forced to be watered, only in this way is it reasonable. Xia Zhiqing accepted this suggestion, and after discussing it with the masses, representatives were selected from the water users, and fair people in the village were also absorbed to form a water conservancy management group. They established a water usage agreement and studied which fields should be rescued urgently and should be watered first, and which fields could be delayed and watered later. At the same time, they repaired loopholes and often checked for gaps. After reasonable water usage, the fourth group, which could not get water in the past, also got water.

Because of the drought, people also had difficulties in getting drinking water. The masses had to go five or six li away to fetch water, which greatly interfered with work. Xia Zhiqing discussed solutions with the masses again. He heard that Uncle Zhang had sealed a well thirty years ago due to oppression by the landlord, so he went to discuss it with Uncle Zhang. Uncle Zhang led the masses to find the place where the well was sealed, dug up the soil, uncovered the stone slab, and saw a well full of water. This well water solved the drinking water problem for more than thirty households. This incident also reminded many elderly people of the wells they had sealed before. Soon, five more wells were found in the whole village, which could not only irrigate the fields, but also solve the drinking water problem. (Cheng Yihua)

    江津县新桥村人民代表积极领导群众抗旱
    四川省江津县双龙乡六月五日完成普选。该乡新桥村新选出的代表夏治清积极领导群众抗旱，受到群众的赞扬。
    新桥村原人民代表赵天林，在去年抗旱时，放松领导，以致农作物减产，群众很有意见。赵天林在其他工作中也表现得不好。如今春他在县里学习回来，对县里布置的春耕生产任务和介绍的水稻增产经验，都没有向群众传达；平时他更独断独行，很少和干部、群众商量问题，对群众的生产、生活漠不关心。今年六月间，双龙乡进行基层选举，新桥村群众慎重地选出了共产党员夏治清作为自己的代表。六月后半月，地干天旱，新桥村百分之八十的稻田全干了，群众情绪十分不安。新桥村有一股从煤炭洞流出来的水，过去群众常因争用水闹意见。为了抗旱和解决用水问题，夏治清深入群众，和群众商量合理使用这个水源的办法。农民欧志彬等见夏治清主动跟他们商量，和赵天林的作风不大一样，便对夏治清说：这股水若不浪费的话，能灌四个组的田。这就先得搞好管理工作，不准一个人独占。该得水的田就放水；水放不进去的田，就不必强放，只有这样才合理。夏治清接受了这个意见，和群众商量之后，由受水户中选出代表，并吸收了村里公正的人组成了水利管理小组，订立了用水公约，研究了那些田该急救，就先放水，那些田可以缓，便后放水。同时修补了漏洞，并经常检查有无缺口。合理用水之后，过去得不到水的第四组也得到水了。
    因为天旱，人吃的水也发生了困难，群众要到五、六里以外去弄水，误工很大。夏治清又和群众商量解决办法。他听说张大爷在三十年前因受地主压迫封了口井，便和张大爷去商量。张大爷领着群众，找到封井的地方，把土挖开，揭开石板，看见满满的一井水。这井水解决了三十多户吃水的困难。这件事使许多老年人也想起以前封的井。不久，全村又找到五眼，既能灌田，也解决了吃水的困难。（程宜华）
