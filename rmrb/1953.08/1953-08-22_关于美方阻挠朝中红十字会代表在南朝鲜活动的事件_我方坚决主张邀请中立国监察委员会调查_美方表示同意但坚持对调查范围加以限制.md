Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 21st: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 21st, both sides agreed to invite the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to investigate the incident in which the US side unreasonably obstructed and restricted the representatives of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross, making it impossible for them to provide humanitarian services to prisoners of war.

At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 20th, our side's chief delegate, General Li Sang-cho, suggested that each side of the Joint Red Cross Team working in Panmunjom send an equal number of representatives to investigate the unreasonable restrictions and obstructions imposed by the US side on the representatives of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross participating in the South Team of the Joint Red Cross Team in violation of the armistice agreement, the incident of UN military police personnel hitting Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives with guns, and the incident of Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives being attacked by gas bombs. At the meeting on the 21st, the US side's chief delegate, Mr. Brierly, opposed the investigation by the Joint Red Cross Team. He advocated that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission conduct the investigation, but unilaterally insisted on limiting the phrasing and scope of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's investigation.

General Li Sang-cho pointed out that since the US side had already violated the armistice agreement, Mr. Brierly could not limit the scope of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's investigation. The Korean-Chinese side will request the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to conduct an investigation in accordance with the armistice agreement. Article 28 of the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that the Military Armistice Commission or any of its chief delegates has the right to request the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to conduct special observation and investigation at locations outside the Demilitarized Zone where violations of this armistice agreement have reportedly occurred.

Both sides agreed to adjourn the Military Armistice Commission meeting and reconvene when either side requests a meeting.

In addition, at the meeting of the secretaries-general of the Military Armistice Commission on the 21st, our side's Secretary-General Zhu Ran raised another incident in which the US side violated the armistice agreement. Two US military vehicles crossed the Military Demarcation Line near Geori-sil, south of Kimhwa. Our civil affairs police have detained US personnel who violated the armistice agreement by crossing the Military Demarcation Line. Secretary-General Zhu Ran proposed that Joint Observer Team Seven handle this incident. US Secretary-General Coleman has expressed agreement.

    关于美方阻挠朝中红十字会代表在南朝鲜活动的事件
    我方坚决主张邀请中立国监察委员会调查
    美方表示同意但坚持对调查范围加以限制
    【新华社开城二十一日电】军事停战委员会二十一日会议上，双方同意邀请中立国监察委员会就美方对朝中红十字会代表加以种种无理阻挠和限制，致使他们不可能为战俘提供人道主义服务的事件进行调查。
    在军事停战委员会二十日会议上，我方首席委员李相朝中将建议：由在板门店工作的联合红十字会小组双方各派同等数目的代表，就美方违反停战协定对参加联合红十字会小组南组的朝中红十字会代表加以种种无理限制和阻挠，联合国军警卫人员举枪撞击朝中红十字会代表，以及朝中红十字会代表遭到毒气弹袭击等事件进行调查。美方首席委员勃里安在二十一日的会议上，反对由联合红十字会小组进行调查。他主张由中立国监察委员会进行调查，但又片面地坚持对中立国监察委员会进行调查的提法和范围加以限定。
    李相朝中将指出：由于美方已经违反了停战协定，勃里安不能对中立国监察委员会的调查范围加以限定。朝中方面将根据停战协定请求中立国监察委员会进行调查。朝鲜停战协定第二十八款规定：军事停战委员会或其中任何一方首席委员有权请求中立国监察委员会至非军事区以外据报发生违反本停战协定事件的地点进行特别观察与调查。
    双方同意军事停战委员会休会，到任何一方要求召开的时候复会。
    此外，在二十一日军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议上，我方秘书长朱然提出美方又一起违反停战协定的事件。美方军用汽车两辆在金城以南巨里室附近越过军事分界线。我方民政警察已将美方违反停战协定越过军事分界线的人员予以扣留。朱然秘书长提议由联合观察小组第七组处理这一事件。美方秘书长柯尔曼已表示同意。
