    On the Economic Construction Front of the Motherland
    Second Group of Anshan Iron and Steel Trainees Return from Soviet Union
    The second group of trainees from the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company, sent to the Soviet Union to study advanced production technology, returned to China on August 8. They have now been assigned to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's large rolling mill, which is under construction, to participate in the preparations for its opening. This group of trainees consists of thirty-seven people, mostly recent graduates from universities and middle schools, and some outstanding production workers from Anshan Iron and Steel. Last August, they were sent to the steel beam workshop of the Ural New Tagil Metallurgical Plant in the Soviet Union, where they spent nearly a year studying in different sections or types of work, such as rolling, finishing, electrical, and production. During the internship, Soviet comrades patiently trained and helped them with planned methods of teaching and learning, and intensive theoretical and technical courses. In less than a year, they learned a set of technical theories and advanced experiences about rolling steel. Most of the trainees are now able to independently take on the production leadership work of a section or type of work.

    Mechanized Shaft Construction at Hegang Coal Mine
    The Hegang Coal Mine is intensively constructing two pairs of vertical shafts, Xing'antai and Dongshan. These two pairs of vertical shafts are fully equipped with the latest Soviet mechanized equipment. There are hoists and coal conveyors above the shafts, and workers underground use electric drills, pneumatic picks, and water pumps, which is very efficient.
    The mine's construction, especially the Xing'antai vertical shaft project, is very difficult because 80 cubic meters of water need to be drained from the bottom of the shaft every hour. However, under the specific guidance of Soviet expert Comrade Bogomolov, advanced Soviet construction experience was adopted, greatly accelerating the progress. For example, in April, the auxiliary shaft exceeded the state plan by 53 percent, with completely qualified quality, and won the glorious award from the Ministry of Fuel Industry.
    These two pairs of vertical shafts will soon be completed. They will produce large amounts of coal in a highly mechanized manner, and their daily output will greatly exceed the total daily output of all Hegang mines currently. Construction workers are currently accelerating the project's progress with selfless labor enthusiasm, striving to hand it over to production as soon as possible.

    Expansion of Xikang Asbestos Mine Construction
    The Xikang Asbestos Mine is the largest asbestos mine in China, with high output and quality. Since the liberation of Xikang, the mine's production has developed rapidly, and this year's daily output has exceeded the annual output before liberation. The asbestos produced can meet the needs of China's steel, electrical, chemical and other industrial sectors, and some of it is exported. To meet the needs of the national economic construction, the asbestos mine is actively expanding construction. The capital construction projects to be completed this year include a 15-kilometer-long mine railway, a 30-kilometer-long mountain road 1,800 meters above sea level, a processing plant with a total area of more than 3,000 square meters, and 36 buildings including workers' dormitories, canteens, clubs, bathhouses, medical clinics, and nurseries. At the same time, surveying and designing of the largest hydroelectric power plant in Xikang is underway. After the completion of these projects, the mine's production outlook and the welfare of employees will be greatly changed. (Yi Ding)

    New Demonstration Silk Reeling Factory Built in Guangdong
    Guangdong Province has superior natural conditions for developing the silk industry, with a warm climate suitable for growing mulberry trees; mulberry leaves can be harvested every year from February to November in the lunar calendar; silkworms can be raised six to eight times a year. However, most of the silk factories in Guangdong Province have dilapidated factory buildings, simple and backward production equipment, and conservative technology, making it impossible to reel high-grade silk. In addition, due to poor management, the output is low, the quality is poor, the processing cost is high, and sales are difficult. This year, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Industry built a Shunde Silk Factory with 20 reeling machines in Shunde County, a mulberry-producing area in central Guangdong, as a demonstration to promote the improvement of production technology and management in various old-fashioned silk factories.
    The machinery and equipment of the Shunde Silk Factory were ordered from East China and have now been shipped; construction began at the end of July and is expected to start production in November this year. The initial task of the factory this year is to focus on training technicians. It is estimated that the daily output of each silk reeling machine will be twice the average daily output of other silk factories with seated reeling equipment, and the quality will be two grades higher than that of existing general silk factories.

    Rotary Kiln Creates Four Consecutive National Safe Operation Records
    The No. 3 rotary kiln in the calcination workshop of the state-owned Guangzhou Xicun Cement Plant has created four consecutive national records for safe operation. The first time was in 1950, operating for 136 days, the second time was in 1951, operating for 238 days, the third time was in 1952, operating for 300 days, and the fourth time was from September 5, 1952 to 8:00 pm on July 21, 1953, operating for 320 days. Extending the safe operation time of the rotary kiln (i.e., reducing the number and time of maintenance, increasing production time) has increased output and saved considerable repair costs.
    The reason why the No. 3 rotary kiln can operate safely for 320 days is mainly due to the fact that employees continuously improve their technology and pay attention to the maintenance of the rotary kiln during the production process.
    The Building Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government has sent technicians to assist the factory in summarizing the experience of safe operation and preparing to promote it to other cement plants.

    More Than 200 Material Exchange Meetings Held in Various Parts of Guizhou Province
    A total of 202 material exchange meetings were held in primary markets in various parts of Guizhou Province in May and June this year, helping farmers of all ethnic groups quickly sell their spring grain and local products, and timely purchase the means of production and living needed for summer production, promoting summer agricultural production.
    At these material exchange meetings, cooperatives in various places universally purchased wheat, rapeseed, tea and other local products from farmers, and supplied the means of production and living in a timely manner. At these material exchange meetings, industrial products such as hoes, sickles, waterwheels, water tanks, and iron pots, and medicinal materials such as safflower, white peony, and windbreak also had a large number of transactions. The exchange of handicraft products and local and special products helped farmers overcome difficulties such as lack of grain and fertilizer. For example, at the material exchange meetings in the towns and townships of Zunyi Prefecture, public and private trade purchased a total of 40 million catties of tung oil and other oils, and farmers of all ethnic groups exchanged them for 1.3 million catties of rice. Many farmers also purchased oil cakes and other fertilizers they desperately needed in the market, enabling farmers of all ethnic groups to smoothly carry out summer agricultural production.
    In order to further develop material exchanges in primary markets, close cooperation with intermediate markets is necessary. The unsalable local products of various counties in northern Guizhou, such as platycodon, jute, and honey, found a market at the material exchange conference jointly held by Zunyi City and Zunyi County. The long-term unsalable potato flour and tetrapanax papyriferus of Guiding Prefecture also found a market at the material exchange conference jointly held by Guiyang City and Guiding Prefecture. Intermediate markets also organize industrial products to go to the countryside to meet the needs of primary markets. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Pastoral Areas in Suiyuan Province Establish Grassland Work Stations
    This spring, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government established grassland work stations in the Ikhao League Autonomous Region and the Ulanqab League Autonomous Region, respectively, which have played a good role in protecting and expanding natural pastures, implementing rational grazing, and gradually trial-planting high-quality forage grasses.
    Ikhao League and Ulanqab League are natural good pastures in Suiyuan Province. Before liberation, the grasslands were severely damaged due to the armed reclamation of reactionary warlords, so they could not adapt to the rapid development of animal husbandry. Some pastures, although lush with pasture, could not be used due to lack of water, or were not suitable for grazing due to the spread of poisonous weeds. For example, it is estimated that about 30 percent of the pastures in Ikhao League were abandoned due to lack of water sources and poisonous weeds, resulting in overgrazing of pastures, which has a great impact on the future development of animal husbandry.
    After the establishment of the grassland work stations in Ikhao and Ulanqab Leagues, they divided into seven groups to conduct in-depth surveys of the carrying capacity and forage quality of pastures, help herders delineate spring, summer, autumn, and winter pastures according to grassland conditions, implement rotational grazing, and trial-plant high-quality forage grasses at the grassland work stations. The Ikhao League Grassland Work Station also helped herders in Dalat Banner, Zhasak Banner, and Dongsheng County trial-plant more than 2,000 mu of alfalfa and oat grass, and distributed more than 8,000 catties of high-quality grass seeds to various mutual aid groups and herders. By the end of June, the Ulanqab League Grassland Work Station had surveyed 15 pastures, selected 18 mowing areas, opened up more than 100 mu of uncultivated land for planting forage grasses, dug a well, and helped herders in various banners plant more than 500 mu of forage grasses, which was very popular among herders.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    鞍钢第二批赴苏实习生归国
    国营鞍山钢铁公司派赴苏联学习先进生产技术的第二批实习生，已在八月八日回国。现在他们已分配到正在兴建的鞍钢大型轧钢厂，参加开工准备工作。这批实习生共三十七人，其中大部分是毕业不久的大学生和中学生，一部分是鞍钢的优秀生产工人。去年八月他们被派到苏联乌拉尔新塔吉尔冶金工厂钢梁车间，分别在压延、精整、电气、生产等不同的工段或工种中进行了将近一年的专业学习。在实习期间，苏联同志有计划地用包教包学和集中上理论技术课等办法，耐心地培养和帮助他们，使他们在不到一年的时间内，就学习了一套关于轧钢的技术理论和先进经验。其中大部分实习生已能独立担负一个工段或工种的生产领导工作。        （新华社）
    鹤岗煤矿建设机械化竖井
    鹤岗煤矿正在紧张地建设着兴安台和东山两对竖井。这两对竖井完全采用苏联最新式的机械化设备，井上有绞车和运煤机，井下的工人都用电钻、风镐及水泵等操作，效率很高。
    矿井的工程，特别是目前兴安台竖井工程是很困难的，因为每小时井底要出八十立方公尺水，但是，在苏联专家鲍格莫洛夫同志的具体指导下，采用了苏联施工的先进经验，使进度大大加速。例如四月份副井超过国家计划百分之五十三，质量完全合格，获得中央燃料工业部的光荣奖励。
    这两对竖井不久就要竣工，它们将以高度机械化的生产方式大量产煤，其日产量将大大超过目前鹤岗各矿的全部日产量。目前建井工人正以忘我的劳动热情加速着工程进度，争取早日移交生产。
    西康石棉矿扩大建设
    西康石棉矿是我国最大的石棉矿，产量和质量都很高。自西康解放后，该矿生产发展迅速，今年的日产量已超过解放前的年产量。出产的石棉，可供我国钢铁、电业、化学等工业部门的需要，并有一部分出口。为配合全国经济建设的需要，石棉矿正积极进行扩大建设工作。今年要完成的基本建设工程，有十五公里长的矿山铁道，全长三十公里，拔海一千八百公尺高的矿山公路，总面积达三千多平方公尺的加工厂一座，以及工人宿舍、食堂、俱乐部、浴室、医疗所、托儿所等建筑三十六幢。同时，正在着手测量和设计一座西康最大的水力发电厂。这些工程完工后，将大大改变矿山的生产面貌和职工的生活福利状况。  （乙丁）
    广东新建示范缫丝厂
    广东省具有发展蚕丝业的优越的自然条件，气候温暖，适宜种桑；每年自农历二月到十一月均有桑叶可采；每年可养蚕六次至八次。但是，广东省的大部分丝厂厂房残旧，生产设备简陋落后，技术保守，不能缫制高级丝，加上经营管理不善，产量低，质量差，加工成本高，销售不易。今年广东省工业厅在粤中区蚕桑产地顺德县新建一间二十绪立缫设备的顺德丝厂，作为示范，以推动各旧式丝厂改进生产技术和经营管理。
    顺德丝厂的机器设备系向华东定购，现已运到；建设工程于七月底开始施工，预计今年十一月间即可开工生产。该厂今年生产初期的任务暂以训练技术工人为主，预计每日每台缫丝车的产量可等于其他坐缫设备的丝厂每台平均日产量的两倍，品质较现有一般丝厂提高二级以上。
    连创四次安全运转全国纪录的回转窑
    国营广州西村水泥厂煅烧车间第三号回转窑连续四次创造了安全运转的全国纪录。第一次在一九五○年，运转一百三十六天，第二次在一九五一年，运转二百三十八天，第三次在一九五二年，运转三百天，第四次自一九五二年九月五日至一九五三年七月二十一日下午八时，运转了三百二十天。回转窑延长了安全运转的时间（即减少检修的次数和时间，增加生产时间）既提高了产量，又节约了为数颇大的修理费用。
    第三号回转窑所以能安全运转三百二十天，主要是由于职工在生产过程中，不断提高技术，重视回转窑的保养。
    中央人民政府重工业部建筑材料管理局已派技术人员去协助该厂总结安全运转的经验，准备向其他水泥厂推广。
    贵州省各地举行二百多次物资交流会
    贵州省各地初级市场在今年五、六月间共举行了二百零二次物资交流会，帮助各民族农民迅速推销小春粮食和土产品，并及时买到夏季生产中需用的生产资料和生活资料，推动了夏季农业生产。
    在这些物资交流会上，各地合作社普遍收购了农民的小麦、菜籽、茶叶及其他土产品，并及时供应了生产资料和生活资料。在这些物资交流会上，手工业产品如锄头、镰刀、水车、水缸、铁锅等，药材如红花、白芍、防风等也有大量成交。手工业产品和土、特产的交流，帮助农民克服缺乏粮食、肥料等的困难。如遵义专区各县集镇的物资交流会上，公私营贸易收购了桐油等油脂共四千万斤，各族农民即换回了大米一百三十万斤。很多农民还在市场上购买了他们所极需的油饼等肥料。使各族农民顺利开展夏季农业生产。
    为使初级市场物资交流的进一步开展，必须有中级市场的密切配合。贵州北部各县滞销的土产桔梗、黄麻、蜂蜜等，是在遵义市和遵义县联合召开的物资交流大会上找到了销路。贵定专区长期滞销的洋芋粉、通草等也是在贵阳市和贵定专区联合召开的物资交流会上找到销路的。中级市场同时还组织工业品下乡，以满足初级市场的需要。

    绥远省牧业区举办草原工作站
    绥远省人民政府今年春天在伊克昭盟自治区和乌兰察布盟自治区分别建立草原工作站，对保护和扩大天然牧场，实行合理放牧，并逐步试种优良牧草等起了良好作用。
    伊克昭盟和乌兰察布盟是绥远省天然的良好牧场。解放前由于反动军阀的武装屯垦，草原受到严重破坏，因此不能适应畜牧业的迅速发展。也有些牧场虽牧草茂密，但因无水而不能利用，或因毒草蔓生，也不宜放牧。如伊盟据估计约有百分之三十左右的牧场因无水源和生毒草而废弃，致使牧场放牧过度，对今后畜牧业的发展有很大影响。
    伊、乌两盟草原工作站成立后，即分七组深入草地调查牧场的载畜量和饲草质量，帮助牧民根据草原情况划出春、夏、秋、冬的牧地，实行轮流放牧，并在草原工作站试种优良牧草。伊盟草原工作站还帮助该盟达拉特旗、扎萨克旗和东胜县的牧民试种了紫花苜蓿和青莜麦二千多亩，并发给各牧业互助组和牧民优良草种八千多斤。乌盟草原工作站到六月底已调查了十五块牧场，选出十八块割草地，开出准备种植牧草的生荒一百多亩，打井一口，还帮助各旗牧民种植牧草五百多亩，很受牧民欢迎。（新华社）
