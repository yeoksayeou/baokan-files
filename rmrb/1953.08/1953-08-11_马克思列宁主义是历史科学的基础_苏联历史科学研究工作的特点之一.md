Marxism-Leninism is the Foundation of Historical Science
—One of the Characteristics of Historical Science Research in the Soviet Union
By Liu Danian, Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Delegation to the Soviet Union

Many friends are concerned about the question: What are the characteristics of Soviet historical science? In my experience, I think the first thing that should be mentioned is that Soviet historical science is truly built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism.

As everyone knows, any science in the Soviet Union today is guided by Marxism-Leninism—dialectical materialism and historical materialism. At the same time, everyone also knows that when Marxism-Leninism is applied to different scientific fields, it has its own characteristics. Using the historical materialist viewpoint to explain the process of human history development and to clarify all the most fundamental issues is an integral part of Marxism. This shows that only by relying on Marxism-Leninism can historical science correctly explain the history of all human societies; conversely, if someone thinks that historical science can be separated from Marxism-Leninism, they are bound to abandon the scientific basis of history and fall into the quagmire of idealism, never being able to understand the objective nature of the laws of historical development.

Soviet historians have rich and successful experience in using Marxism to conduct historical research. This can be clearly seen from the large number of historical works they have published or the work they have introduced.

Grasping the basic viewpoints of materialism is the first thing that Soviet historians pay attention to in their work. They believe that regarding social history as the history of social production development and social class struggle is the fundamental principle that distinguishes Marxist historical science from all idealist historiography. Based on this principle, Soviet historians attach great importance to the study of socio-economic data, including all data related to the development of social relations of production and social productive forces. Their opinion is that economics is the soul of history, and we must prevent the phenomenon of studying political and cultural data from being separated from the study of economic data. Only by possessing and carefully analyzing economic data can we explain the development process of a certain social production, the economic system of this society, and the history of class relations and class struggle under this system. Soviet historians also pointed out: Studying economic data and summarizing it well is a very complex task. In this regard, Lenin's "The Development of Capitalism in Russia," "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," and Stalin's summary reports on the work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at various party congresses are models for us to learn from. In the works of Lenin and Stalin, they often analyze some of the most fundamental historical issues based on the situation shown by a large amount of economic data.

For the same reason, Soviet scholars tell us: The division of historical periods is not based on the distance of years or any other principles, but on socio-economic formations, that is, according to the five modes of production in the process of social historical development prescribed by Marx. For example, ancient history refers to the history of slave society, medieval history refers to the history of feudal society, modern history is the history of capitalist society, and contemporary history is the history after the October Socialist Revolution. This is how historical works are divided into periods, and this is also how historical museums are displayed.

Specifically analyzing specific situations is a famous principle of Marxism, and Soviet historians have successfully applied this principle. For example, in dealing with historical figures, Soviet historians pointed out: We must use a historical viewpoint to analyze the era in which historical figures were located, analyze the main and non-main aspects of their activities, explain the practical significance of the activities of historical figures at that time, and so on, so as to present the original appearance of these figures. If we leave the specific historical situation and use today's standards to measure the ancients, there will be no progressive figures in history. The Soviet historians' evaluation of historical figures such as Peter the Great and Suvorov is a good example of their truly treating historical figures from a historical point of view. Regarding Peter the Great, as Stalin said, comparing Peter the Great with the great Lenin, Lenin is the sea, and Peter is just a drop in the ocean. But this does not deny that Peter the Great was a figure who played a progressive role in promoting Russia's development towards capitalism. Similarly, Suvorov once persecuted the famous Russian revolutionary Buktyuv, but Suvorov is still a national hero.

The same is true for national movements. According to Stalin's instructions on the theory of national issues, Soviet scholars pointed out that national movements may be progressive or reactionary. To study the history of national movements, we must specifically analyze which class leads it, the movement for the interests of that class, analyze all the important factors related to this movement, and then determine whether the role it played in history was progressive or reactionary. For example, in the process of Kazakhstan's merger into Russia in the first half of the 19th century, on the one hand, this merger eliminated the danger of Kazakhstan being politically dismembered and guaranteed the economic and cultural exchanges between the Kazakh people and Russia; on the other hand, this merger also brought heavy exploitation and oppression of Kazakh workers by Russian landlords and the bourgeoisie. Under this circumstance, there was the uprising of several nomadic tribes of the Muslim League led by Isadai Daminov and others from 1836 to 1837. Soviet historians pointed out that this uprising was a liberation movement of the Kazakh working people against the Tsarist colonial system and Kazakh feudal lords. It was closely linked to the struggle of the oppressed Russian peasants, and therefore it was a progressive movement. At the same time, there was also an armed rebellion led by Ginesal Kasemov and others from 1837 to 1847. Soviet historians pointed out that the leaders and organizers of this rebellion were a feudal exploitation group in Kazakhstan, whose sole purpose was to demand that the monopoly of exploiting local workers be maintained in their own hands. Therefore, it was neither revolutionary nor progressive. It was a reactionary movement that dragged the Kazakh people backward, consolidated the foundation of the patriarchal feudal system, and separated Kazakhstan from Russia and the great Russian working people. These two events both seem to be national movements and occurred in the same region and at the same time, but the conclusions drawn are completely different due to specific class analysis.

Another characteristic of Soviet historians is that they are good at creatively using Marxism to study history. Soviet scholars tell us: Applying Marxism-Leninism means truly understanding the content and essence of Marxism-Leninism, not treating individual conclusions and formulas of Marxism-Leninism as dogma. They quoted Comrade Stalin's instruction: "Marxism, as a science, cannot stand still—it is developing and improving. In its development, Marxism cannot but be enriched by new experiences and new knowledge—therefore, its individual formulas and conclusions cannot but change with time and be replaced by new formulas and conclusions adapted to new historical tasks. Marxism does not recognize immutable conclusions and formulas that are absolutely adaptable to all eras and periods. Marxism is the enemy of all dogmatism.” ( "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" People's Publishing House edition) According to Comrade Stalin's instructions, Soviet historians, on the one hand, oppose the random quotation of Marxist phrases, and on the other hand, are good at using new ideas in Marxist classic works to conduct creative research. They believe that correctly applying everything new in Marxist-Leninist theory to their research and never allowing their theoretical level to remain in one place is a guarantee of high quality and highly creative research results. For example, the recent widespread study and application of Stalin's "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" and "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" by Soviet historians is an example of this. They are currently rewriting Soviet college history textbooks with high scientific quality and revising some specialized works based on the ideas in Stalin's works. These textbooks and works require the full development of Stalin's theories in combination with different specific materials. Many historians are also conducting in-depth research on Stalin's theory on the development of productive forces and relations of production, the theory on the basic economic laws of modern capitalism and socialism, and so on.

Regarding this aspect, Soviet scholars specifically pointed out that the outstanding works of Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, have played a huge role for Soviet scientists and advanced people in other countries. Soviet scholars are studying the ideas in these works with great attention. Soviet historians attach great importance to studying Chinese history based on the viewpoints in Chairman Mao's works.

Soviet historical science, like other sciences in the Soviet Union, has achieved such brilliant achievements today and reached the highest level in the world. It goes without saying that this is the result of Soviet historians truly grasping Marxist-Leninist theory and being good at using Marxist-Leninist theory to conduct creative research.

How to master Marxism-Leninism, does it have any "secrets"? Soviet scholars' opinions on this issue can be summarized as follows: having a high desire for knowledge and consciously paying the greatest amount of labor; mastering Marxist-Leninist literature, especially mastering the classic works of Marxism-Leninism; learning to use Marxist-Leninist viewpoints to conduct independent and creative research. This is the most basic way. This shows that truly mastering Marxism-Leninism is not a simple process, but a complex process of delving into Marxist literature and delving into this science in the most in-depth way. However, the door to the scientific treasure house of Marxism-Leninism is open, and people can find what they need here as long as they work hard.

### 马克思列宁主义是历史科学的基础——苏联历史科学研究工作的特点之一

    马克思列宁主义是历史科学的基础
    ——苏联历史科学研究工作的特点之一
    中国科学院访苏代表团团员  刘大年
    许多朋友们都关心这样一个问题：苏联历史科学的特点是什么？据我的体会，我认为应该首先提到的，就是苏联的历史科学是真正建筑在马克思列宁主义的基础上的。
    大家都知道，今天苏联的任何一门科学，都是以马克思列宁主义——辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义为指导思想的。同时，大家也知道，马克思列宁主义在不同的科学领域中加以应用的时候，是有自己的特点的。用历史唯物主义观点解释人类历史发展过程，阐明其中一切最根本的问题，是马克思主义的一个组成部分。这就说明历史科学只有依据马克思列宁主义，才能使一切人类社会的历史得到正确的解释；反之，如果有人以为可以把历史科学同马克思列宁主义割裂开来，那就必定是抛弃历史学的科学基础，掉到唯心主义的泥坑里，永远不能了解历史发展规律的客观性质。
    苏联史学家有着丰富的运用马克思主义进行历史研究的成功的经验。这不论是从他们发表的大量历史著作或他们所介绍的工作情况中，都可以很明显地看到。
    掌握唯物主义的基本观点，是苏联史学家在他们的工作中首先注意到的。他们认为把社会历史看作是社会生产发展与社会阶级斗争的历史，是马克思主义历史科学与一切唯心主义的历史学相区别的根本原则。根据这个原则，苏联史学家们很重视社会经济资料的研究，这里包括一切与社会生产关系和社会生产力的发展有关的资料。他们的意见是，经济是历史的灵魂，必须防止研究政治、文化等方面的资料与研究经济资料脱节的现象。只有占有和详细地分析了经济资料，才能说明某个社会生产发展过程，说明这个社会的经济制度和这个制度下的阶级关系与阶级斗争的历史。苏联史学家还指出：要研究经济资料并很好地加以总结，是一个非常复杂的工作。在这方面，列宁的“俄国资本主义发展”、“帝国主义是资本主义底最高阶段”和斯大林在各次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告等著作，是我们学习的典范。在列宁、斯大林的著作中，往往根据许多经济资料所表示出的情况，来分析某些历史上最根本的问题。
    由于同样的道理，苏联学者告诉我们：对历史时期的划分，不是依据年代的远近或其他什么原则，而是以社会经济形态为基础的，即按照马克思所规定的社会历史发展过程中的五种生产方式来划分历史时期。如古代史就是指奴隶社会的历史，中世纪史就是封建社会史，近代史是资本主义社会史，现代史，则是十月社会主义革命以后的历史。历史著作的分期是这样，历史博物馆的陈列也是这样。
    具体地分析具体情况，是马克思主义的著名原理，苏联史学家成功地运用了这个原理。例如对待历史人物，苏联史学家指出：必须用历史主义的观点去分析历史人物所处的时代，分析他们活动的主要方面与非主要方面，说明历史人物的活动在当时所具有的实际意义等等，然后才能呈现出这些人物的本来面目。假使我们离开了具体的历史情况，用今天的标准去衡量古人，历史上就将没有任何进步人物。苏联史学家对于彼得大帝、苏沃罗夫等历史人物的评价，是他们真正用历史主义观点对待历史人物的很好的实例。关于彼得大帝，正如斯大林说过的，拿彼得大帝与伟大的列宁相比，列宁是大海，彼得只是沧海一粟。但是这并没有否认彼得大帝是在推动俄国走向资本主义发展的道路上起过进步作用的人物。同样的，苏沃罗夫曾经迫害过俄国著名的革命家布克秋夫，但是苏沃罗夫仍不失其为民族英雄。
    对于民族运动也是如此。苏联学者根据斯大林关于民族问题理论的指示，指出民族运动可能是进步的，也可能是反动的。研究民族运动的历史，必须具体地分析它是由那个阶级领导，为了那个阶级的利益的运动，分析和这个运动有关联的一切重要的因素，然后才能断定它在历史上所起的作用，是进步的还是反动的。例如在十九世纪前半叶哈萨克斯坦合并于俄国的过程中，一方面是这个合并消除了哈萨克在政治上被肢解的危险，保证了哈萨克人民和俄国的经济及文化的交流；另一方面，这个合并也带来了俄国地主和资产阶级对哈萨克劳动者的沉重的剥削和压迫。在这种情况之下，有一八三六年到一八三七年的伊萨达伊·达伊诺夫等人领导下的几个游牧部落的回教联盟的起义。苏联史学家指出：这个起义是哈萨克劳动人民反对沙皇殖民制度和哈萨克封建主的解放运动。它和被压迫的俄罗斯农民的斗争是密切结合着的，因此，它是进步的运动。与这同时，也有一八三七年到一八四七年盖涅萨勒·卡塞莫夫等人所领导的武装暴动。苏联史学家则指出：这个暴动的领导者和组织者，是哈萨克的一个封建剥削集团，其唯一目的，是要求把剥削当地劳动人民的垄断权保持在自己手里。因此，它既不是革命的，也不是进步的，这是把哈萨克人民拉向后退，巩固宗法封建制度的基础，使哈萨克斯坦脱离俄国和伟大俄罗斯劳动人民的反动运动。这两件事看来都是民族运动，而且发生在同一个地区，同一个时期，由于进行了具体的阶级分析，所得出的结论却是完全不同。
    苏联史学家还有另一个特色，就是善于创造性地运用马克思主义来研究历史。苏联学者告诉我们：应用马克思列宁主义，是要真正懂得马克思列宁主义的内容和实质，不是把马克思列宁主义的个别结论和公式当做教条。他们引证斯大林同志的指示：“马克思主义这一科学是不能停滞不前的，——它是在发展着和改进着。马克思主义在自己的发展中不能不以新的经验、新的知识而丰富起来，——因而它的个别公式和结论不能不随时间而改变，不能不被适应于新的历史任务的新的公式和结论所代替。马克思主义不承认绝对适应于一切时代和时期的不变的结论和公式。马克思主义是一切教条主义的敌人。（“马克思主义与语言学问题”人民出版社版）根据斯大林同志的指示，苏联史学家一方面反对胡乱地引用马克思主义的词句，另一方面善于利用马克思主义经典著作中的新思想，进行创造性的研究。他们认为正确地把马克思列宁主义理论中一切新的东西用到自己的研究工作中去，永远不使自己的理论水平停留在一个地方，是使研究成果有很高的质量和有高度创造性的保证。例如近来苏联史学家对斯大林的“马克思主义与语言学问题”和“苏联社会主义经济问题”的广泛研究和运用便是如此。他们目前正在根据斯大林著作中的思想，重新编写具有高度科学性的苏联高等学校历史教科书，修改一些专门著作。在这些教科书和著作中，要求结合着不同的具体材料把斯大林的理论加以充分地发挥。也有不少的史学家正在对斯大林关于生产力与生产关系的发展的理论，关于现代资本主义和社会主义的基本经济法则的理论等进行深入的研究。
    关于这方面，苏联学者特别指出：中国人民领袖毛泽东同志的卓越著作，对苏联科学家及其他国家先进的人们都起着巨大的作用。苏联学者正以很大的注意力研究着这些著作中的思想。苏联史学家们很重视根据毛主席著作中的论点来从事中国历史的研究。
    苏联的历史科学同苏联其他科学一样，获得了今天这样光辉的成绩，达到了世界最高的水平。用不着说明，这正是苏联史学家们真正掌握了马克思列宁主义理论，并善于运用马克思列宁主义理论进行创造性的研究的结果。
    怎样掌握马克思列宁主义，它有没有什么“秘诀”？苏联学者对这个问题的意见，可以归纳如下：即有高度的求知欲望，自觉地付出最大量的劳动；掌握马克思列宁主义的文献，特别是掌握马克思列宁主义的经典著作；学习运用马克思列宁主义的观点，进行独立的创造性的研究。这就是最基本的途径。这说明要真正掌握马克思列宁主义，并不是一个简单的过程，而是一个最深入地钻研马克思主义文献，钻研本门科学的复杂过程。但是马克思列宁主义这座科学宝库的大门是敞开着的，人们只要经过辛勤的努力，就能够在这里找到自己所需要的东西。
