   【新华社开城九日电】军事分界线标志物八日开始设置。军事停战委员会第三到第十联合观察小组朝中方面组员与美方组员在八月七日下午二时分别会晤，我方组员通知美方：我方设立标志物的准备工作已经完成。我方并敦促美方商定了开始树立标志物的时间。在第三、第四、第六、第七、第八、第九小组地区，八日我方已按协议派出由七十五名非武装人员组成的、佩带着识别记号的“标志队”，由我方首席组员指派的助理军官监督，到军事分界线上我方负责地段内开始工作。美方也在大约相同的时间在其负责地段内开始设置军事分界线标志物的工作。第五小组和第十小组地区我方将于九日开始工作。第五小组美方称准备工作尚未完成，须于十一日方能开始。
    设置军事分界线标志物的工作，我方将于十二日前全部完成，如美方也能同时完成，那么联合观察小组即可开始进行检查和校正工作。
