Investigation of Private Lending Relationships in Rural Nanyue Township, Xishui County
    Wang Xuejin
    In order to understand rural private lending relationships, the Work Group of the Rural Work Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted an investigation in Nanyue Township, Xishui County. Among the 222 households in the six electoral districts of the township, 121 households had lending relationships, accounting for 54 percent of the total number of households, with a total of 72,101 jin of grain lent. Among them, 70 households had debts from before liberation that have not yet been settled, with a total of 42,194 jin of grain lent, accounting for 58.5 percent of the total amount lent. New lending relationships after the land reform involved 74 households, with 29,907 jin of grain lent, accounting for 41.5 percent of the total amount lent. The details are as follows:
    Old Debts from Before Liberation
    The unsettled debts from before liberation mainly involve lending between farmers, with a small portion from wealthy peasants, those living off interest, and industrialists and merchants who were also landlords. The borrowers were mainly poor and hired peasants, and those borrowed by vagrants accounted for 86.77 percent of the total amount borrowed. The vast majority of these loans were used to solve difficulties such as food, weddings, funerals, and illnesses, with a portion used to cover conscription fees and gambling. The vast majority of old debts involved high-interest exploitation, with loans of goods requiring one shi to be repaid with two shi in the autumn, and a monthly interest rate of one percent for money loans.
    The repayment status of old debts between farmers from before liberation is as follows: those who paid less than one times the principal in interest accounted for 38.5 percent of the total number of debtor households; those who paid between one and two times the principal in interest accounted for 11.8 percent of the total number of debtor households; those who paid between two and three times the principal in interest accounted for 2.5 percent of the total number of debtor households; those who paid more than three times the principal in interest accounted for 2.2 percent of the total number of debtor households; and those who paid no principal or interest at all accounted for 45 percent of the total number of debtor households.
    Why do those who paid no principal or interest at all account for 45 percent of the total number of debtor households?
    First, some debtor households are facing serious difficulties and simply have no ability to repay. According to the investigation, five households in difficulty owed a total of 10,128 jin of grain converted from debts, of which 7,159 jin were old debts. Since liberation, only three households have repaid 764 jin. These five households consist of one poor peasant household, one small land-renting household, and three vagrant households. Why did they incur debts, and what difficulties do they have in repayment?
    Before liberation, the poor peasant Wang Deming was induced to gamble and borrowed the equivalent of 1,148 jin of grain. After the land reform, there were more mouths to feed and fewer people to farm, and with his own frequent illnesses, income could not increase, and living expenses only increased year by year, making things more and more difficult.
    Hu Yongnian, a small land renter, was a village tutor before liberation, specializing in teaching "Hundred Family Surnames" and "Three Character Classic." Now children no longer read these books, and he is old and has nothing to do. The grain he produces is not enough for his own consumption. He has 560 jin of grain in old debts that have not been repaid, and he has newly borrowed 840 jin of grain. Although the debt is not large, he is unable to repay it.
    The other three vagrant households owe a total of 7,440 jin of grain. Of this, 5,451 jin were old debts, 75 percent of which were used for gambling, 13 percent for food, and 4.4 percent for engaging in itinerant trading. Before liberation, they had no fixed occupation and lived by deception and gambling. Now they have land but do not work hard. The masses of farmers reflect that they "eat the struggle meal, eat the relief meal, and still want to eat from the communal pot in the future." They have the idea of defaulting on debts. Since liberation, only one household has repaid 610 jin, and the others have paid no principal or interest at all.
    Second, a small portion of the lending capital of lenders was derived from exploitation (debts from wealthy peasants, those living off interest, and industrialists and merchants who were also landlords, accounted for 28.2 percent of the total old debt). Debtor households are generally not proactive in repaying such debts.
    The debts of debtor households who owe small amounts and have the ability to repay have been cleared. Some of the more difficult poor and hired peasants actively negotiate with the creditors, obtain their consent, and decide to repay in installments or postpone repayment. However, a small number of farmers believe that since they cannot repay anyway, they might as well not repay for the time being, and say to the creditors: "I'll repay you when I get things sorted out." Some households even attack creditors on individual occasions. Shang Bochen owed Gong Guangjian 15 jin of seed cotton. Last year, when Gong asked Shang for the debt, Shang spat at Gong and pushed him out of the door.
    For those who have already paid twice the principal in interest, most debtor households adopt two methods: both parties automatically terminate the debt, or "drag" it on and do not want to repay it anymore.
    Many old debts have been accumulated, and creditors are very dissatisfied, saying: "The government's loans also have interest, and there is borrowing and repayment; why do people not only not give interest when they borrow my money, but also not repay the principal?"
    Current Rural Private Lending Relationships and Their Characteristics
    With the development of the rural economy and to meet the needs of production development, the stagnation of rural private lending in the previous one or two years has fundamentally changed. New lending relationships after the land reform account for 33.4 percent of the total number of residents' households. Lending is still mainly in kind (7,857 jin of rice, 895 jin of wheat, 491 jin of rapeseed, 240 jin of cane sugar, and 186 jin of cotton). Monetary lending (2.56 million yuan) has begun to become active, and a small number of silver dollars are operating in secret.
    Among the 28 households lending, poor and hired peasants account for 16 households, and the amount lent accounts for 64.8 percent of the total amount lent; middle peasants account for 10 households, and the amount lent accounts for 31.76 percent of the total amount lent; and handicraftsmen account for 2 households, and the amount lent accounts for 3.44 percent of the total amount lent.
    Among the 46 households borrowing, poor and hired peasants account for 36 households, and the amount borrowed accounts for 72.38 percent of the total amount borrowed; middle peasants account for 4 households, and the amount borrowed accounts for 14.66 percent of the total amount borrowed; small land renters account for 3 households, and the amount borrowed accounts for 7.89 percent of the total amount borrowed; handicraftsmen account for 1 household, and the amount borrowed accounts for 1.84 percent of the total amount borrowed; and landlords account for 2 households, and the amount borrowed accounts for 3.22 percent of the total amount borrowed.
    Of the debts borrowed by all debtor households, those used for food account for 43.14 percent of the total amount borrowed; those used for weddings and funerals account for 42.87 percent; those invested in production account for 7.26 percent; those used for building houses account for 3.99 percent; and those used for medical treatment account for 2.74 percent.
    The forms of lending and borrowing and the interest rate ratios are: lending in kind, repaying as soon as borrowed, and only listening to rises and not listening to falls accounting for 34.7 percent of the total lending capital; interest-free monetary lending accounting for 30.8 percent of the lending capital; lending goods and repaying goods, borrowing in the spring and repaying in the summer, borrowing in the summer and repaying in the autumn, borrowing one dou and repaying one and a half dou accounting for 19.44 percent of the lending capital; borrowing one dou and repaying one and three dou accounting for 2.9 percent of the lending capital; "dry field" lending similar to pawning accounting for 12.17 percent of the lending capital.
    Current private lending relationships have the following characteristics:
    1. After the land reform, the newly occurring lending relationships in rural areas are mainly debts between farmers with a mutual aid and mutual assistance nature, which effectively solves the difficulties encountered by farmers in life and production, promotes agricultural production, and improves the relationship between farmers.
    2. The economy of most farmers has risen, which is not only reflected in the increase in the amount of lending by poor and hired peasants (the amount of lending by poor and hired peasants accounts for 64.8 percent of the total new debt), but also in the fact that farmers no longer borrow for "conscription fees" and gambling. Borrowing is gradually decreasing, and some debts are even directly used for production. This is a positive aspect. On the other hand, some farmers still have many difficulties in production and life. If they encounter weddings, funerals, and illnesses, the difficulties are even greater, and they need to borrow. However, because some wealthier farmers are afraid of "standing out" and the impact of some accumulated old debts, private lending relationships have not yet been fully brought into line. Lending is generally not public. Farmers say: "You can't borrow money unless you are close relatives." It is understood that lending between farmers was also not public before liberation (those who dared to lend and dare to ask for it were mainly landlords, those living off interest, and a small number of wealthy peasants with political status). Now, some people with surplus money are afraid that there will not be enough to go around and they will offend people, and some are afraid of attracting attention by lending, fearing "permission today and struggle tomorrow," so they are unwilling to lend. The current "interest-free lending" accounts for about one-third, and the time is shortened. Before liberation, lending in kind was generally borrowed in the spring and repaid in the autumn, but now it is borrowed in the spring and repaid in the summer, and borrowed in the summer and repaid in the autumn. In individual electoral districts, a "dry field" phenomenon similar to pawning has appeared, where borrowing one shi of grain pawns two or three shi of grain field, and all the harvest goes to the creditor, with the borrower paying the grain tax. The term is one year, and the field is returned upon expiration.
    3. Development is unbalanced, and lending relationships in some electoral districts are still in a stagnant state. Before liberation, seven households in Shangjiawan lent money, and the old debts that were lent out have not yet been recovered. Now, none of the seven households are lending. Currently, only one lonely old man is lending 62,000 yuan in RMB.
    Some Opinions on How to Normalize Rural Private Lending
    How can rural private lending be normalized and made conducive to the development of agricultural production? I think we should grasp the following three key links:
    1. Correctly handle old debts. When disputes arise over debt relationships from before liberation, mediation should be carried out based on the economic conditions of both the borrower and the lender; for those with serious difficulties and no ability to repay, it can be handled appropriately based on the local historical methods and customs of farmers clearing old debts.
    It is understood that farmers in the township have a "debt chopping" habit, that is, the debtor household takes out a certain amount of materials according to the family's economic situation and pays it off in one lump sum. There are two ways: one is bankruptcy; the debtor household actively invites the creditor to the scene and hands over all land, houses, and other properties to the creditor for the creditor to dispose of on their own. This method is not allowed according to the current awareness of farmers. The second is to obtain the creditor's consent, stop interest and repay the principal in installments, or repay half or one-third of the debt principal and interest, that is, terminate the debt relationship. This method is initiated by the debtor household or advocated by a few creditors and agreed to by most. Under the current situation, farmers are unwilling to "chop," vagrants want to "chop" but the masses do not sympathize, and creditors believe that "repaying a little is better than not repaying at all."
    2. Advocate thrift and prevent usury from reviving. Serious waste is found everywhere in rural areas when handling weddings and funerals. Those used for these two items account for 42.87 percent of the new debt. Last year, when the father of the poor peasant Zhai Xunqing died, he owed 1,883 jin of grain in order to buy a "Yuahua coffin" and wrap it in "one silk and six pieces of cloth, seven layers inside and out." The poor peasant Liao Kanggui married a wife, his wife died, and he remarried. Now he is divorced again. He owed a total of 1,545 jin of grain for handling weddings and funerals before and after. The old debts have not been repaid, and new debts have been added, making life and production extremely difficult. A small number of farmers are even on the verge of bankruptcy because of this. If these wasteful habits are changed in rural areas and normal lending is activated, it will not be easy for usury to revive.
    3. Give full play to the leading role of the National Bank in rural finance, steadily and actively develop rural credit cooperatives, concentrate idle funds, and solve the difficulties of some farmers in expanding reproduction and life. As for some farmers who are threatened by life due to unforeseen disasters (natural disasters and man-made disasters), in addition to lending, righteous granaries can also be organized to solve the problem.

    浠水县南岳乡农村私人借贷关系调查
    王学晋
    为了了解农村私人借贷关系，中共湖北省委农村工作部工作组到浠水县南岳乡作了调查。该乡六个选区的二二二户中，有借贷关系者共一二一户，占总户数百分之五四，借贷粮食共七二一○一斤。其中解放前的债务关系现在尚未了的有七十户，借贷粮食共四二一九四斤，占借贷总数百分之五八点五。土地改革后新发生借贷关系的有七四户，借贷粮食二九九○七斤，占借贷总数百分之四一点五。现分述如下：
    解放前的旧债
    解放前的债务关系现在尚未了的，主要是农民相互之间的借贷，还有一小部分是富农、债利生活者和工商业兼地主所放的债。借债者主要是贫雇农，他们借债的数量加上游民借入者占借债总数百分之八六点七七。他们借的债款极大部分是用于解决口粮、婚丧、疾病等困难，有一部分是用于开支壮丁费和赌博。旧债极大部分带有高利盘剥性质，实物借贷春借一石秋还二石，钱利月息加一。
    农民之间解放前的旧债的偿付情况是：付利不及本钱一倍者，占借债户总数百分之三八点五；付利一倍于本不到二倍者，占借债户总数百分之一一点八；付利二倍于本不到三倍者，占借债户总数百分之二点五；付利超过本三倍者，占借债户总数百分之二点二；本利完全未付者，占借债户总数百分之四五。
    为什么本利完全未付者占借债户总数的百分之四五？
    首先是因为有的欠债户存在着严重困难，根本没有偿付能力。据调查，五个困难户欠债折粮一○一二八斤，其中旧债七一五九斤，解放后只有三户还债七六四斤。这五户是一户贫农，一户小土地出租者，三户游民。他们为什么欠债，还债又有甚么困难呢？
    贫农王德明解放前被人诱骗赌博，借债折粮一一四八斤。土地改革后吃饭人多，种田人少，又加上自己多病，收入不能增加，生活消费又有添无减，一年比一年困难。
    小土地出租者胡永年是乡村的塾师，解放前专教“百家姓”、“三字经”，现在儿童不读这些书，他年老无事可作，生产的粮食还不够自己吃，旧债五六○斤粮未还，又新借债八四○斤粮。债虽不多，但却无力偿还。
    其他三户游民，共欠债七四四○斤。其中旧债五四五一斤，百分之七十五用于赌博，百分之十三用于口粮，百分之四点四用于做行商生意。他们在解放前没有固定职业，以欺骗赌博为生，现在有了土地但不好好劳动。农民群众反映他们“吃了斗争饭吃救济饭，还想将来吃大锅饭”。他们有赖债思想，解放后仅一户还过六一○斤，其他本利完全未付。
    其次，有一小部放债者的债利资本是剥削来的（富农、债利生活者和工商业兼地主放的债，总共占旧债总数百分之二八点二）。借债户对这种债一般都不积极偿还。
    借债户中欠债不多而又有清偿能力者的债务已清偿了。部分比较困难的贫雇农，主动与债主协商，取得对方同意，决定分期或缓期偿还。但少数农民认为反正清偿不了，不如暂时不还，就对债主说：“等我搞转了些，再还你”，个别户在个别场合打击债主，农民尚伯臣欠龚广见十五斤皮花，去年龚向尚要债，尚向龚吐口水，并把他推出门外。
    付利已二倍于本者，大多数借债户采取两种方法：双方自动解除债务，或者“拖”下去不想再还了。
    许多旧债被积压了下来，债主很不满意，说：“政府放债也有息，有借有还；为什么人们借了我的钱，不仅利不给，本也不还？”
    目前农村私人借贷关系及其特点
    随着农村经济的发展，并适应生产发展的需要，前一、二年农村私人借贷的停滞状况根本变化了。土地改革后新发生借贷关系者占居民总户数百分之三三点四，借贷仍以实物为主（谷七八五七斤，小麦八九五斤，菜籽四九一斤，蔗糖二四○斤，棉花一八六斤），货币借贷（二五六万元）开始活跃，并有少数银元暗中活动。
    放债的二八户中，贫雇农占一六户，放债额占放债总数百分之六四点八；中农占十户，放债额占放债总数百分之三一点七六；手工业者占二户，放债额占放债总数百分之三点四四。
    借债者四六户中，贫雇农占三六户，借债数占借债总数百分之七二点三八；中农占四户，借债数占借债总数百分之一四点六六；小土地出租者占三户，借债数占借债总数百分之七点八九；手工业者占一户，借债数占借债总数百分之一点八四；地主占二户，借债数占借债总数百分之三点二二。
    全体借债户所借的债，用于口粮者占借债总数百分之四三点一四；用于婚丧者占百分之四二点八七；投资生产者占百分之七点二六；用于造屋者占百分之三点九九；用于治病者占百分之二点七四。
    借贷形式及息借比例是：实物借贷，随借随还，听涨不听跌者占债利资本总数百分之三四点七；货币无息借贷者占债利资本百分之三○点八；借物还物，春借夏还，夏借秋还，借斗还斗半者占债利资本百分之一九点四四；借斗还斗三者占债利资本百分之二点九；类似典当的“干田”借贷占债利资本百分之一二点一七。
    目前私人借贷关系有如下几个特点
    一、土地改革后，农村新发生的借贷关系，主要是农民之间带有互助互济性质的债务，它有力地解决了农民在生活和生产中所遭遇的困难，推动了农业生产并改善了农民相互间的关系。
    二、大多数农民经济上升，这不仅表现在贫雇农放债数量增加（贫雇农放债数量占新债总数百分之六四点八），还表现在农民不再为“壮丁费”和赌博借债，借债逐渐减少，有的债款并且直接用于生产，这是积极的一面。另一方面，一部分农民在生产和生活中还有很多困难，如遇婚丧疾病，困难就更大，需要借债。但由于有些较富裕的农民怕“冒尖”和部分旧债受积压的影响，私人借贷关系尚未完全纳入正轨。借贷一般仍不公开，农民说：“非亲上加亲，借不到债”。据了解，解放前农民之间的借贷也是不公开的（敢放敢要的主要是地主、债利生活者和少数有政治地位的富农）现在有余钱的人有的怕“僧多粥少”借不匀得罪人，有的怕放债招风，怕“今天允许，明天又要斗争”，因此不愿出借。现在的“无息借贷”约占三分之一，时间缩短了，解放前实物借贷一般春借秋还，现在是春借夏还，夏借秋还。个别选区出现类似典当的“干田”现象，借一石谷押二石或三石谷田，收获量全部归债主，借方完粮，期限一年，期满退田。
    三、发展不平衡，有的选区借贷关系仍停留在死滞状态。尚家塆解放前七户放债，放出的旧债尚未收回，现在七户都不放了。目前仅另一户孤老放人民币六万二千元。
    对如何使农村私人借贷走向正常的几点意见
    如何使农村私人借贷走向正常并使之有利于发展农业生产呢？我以为应抓住如下三个环节：
    一、正确处理旧债。解放前的债务关系发生纠纷时，应根据借贷双方经济状况加以调解；严重困难户无偿付能力者，可根据当地历史上农民清理旧债的方法与习惯酌情处理。
    据了解，该乡农民有“剁债”习惯，即借债户根据家庭经济状况拿出一定数量的物资一次偿清，其方式有二：一是破产；借债户主动邀请债主到场，将土地、房屋及其他财产悉数交给债主，由债主自行处理。这种方式，依照今天农民的觉悟是不允许的。二是取得债主的同意，停利分期还本，或清偿债利资本的一半或三分之一，即解除其债务关系。这种方法有借债户主动邀请解决的，也有债主中少数人倡导起来大多数同意的。目前情况，农民不愿“剁”，游民要“剁”群众不同情，债主则认为“还一点比不还好”。
    二、提倡节约，防止高利贷乘隙复活。农村到处发现办婚丧事时候的严重浪费现象，新债用于这两项者占百分之四二点八七。贫农翟训卿去年父死，为了买一具“元花寿木”，并裹“一绸六帛、里外七层”，负债一八八三斤粮。贫农廖康贵娶妻、妻死、又娶妻，现在又离婚了，他为了办婚丧事前后负债共一五四五斤粮，旧债未还新债又压上了，生活生产极感困难。少数农民并因此即将破产。农村中如果改变了这些浪费的习惯，并使正常借贷活跃起来，高利贷是不易复活的。
    三、充分发挥国家银行对农村金融的领导作用，稳步积极地发展农村信用合作社，集中闲散资金，解决部分农民扩大再生产和生活当中的困难。至于某些因意外灾害（天灾人祸）而受到生活威胁的农民，除借贷外，还可组织义仓解决。
