(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 22nd) Returned Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war today gave our reporter a memorandum addressed to United Nations Commander-in-Chief Clark, protesting the U.S. side's forced detention of prisoners of war and bloody atrocities of abusing prisoners of war. This memorandum was handed to U.S. Army Captain Sairos of the No. 8 POW camp on Jeju Island at 8:00 p.m. on July 27 by Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in the POW camp. On August 5th and 11th, Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war submitted the same text each, in Munsan, to the U.S. representative of the Joint Red Cross Team, requesting them to forward it to Clark.

The memorandum first pointed out: The purpose of this memorandum is to provide the actual situation of life in the United Nations POW camps since the Korean War, as a testament to the division between civilization and barbarism in the 20th century and historical judgment.

The memorandum said: When we were captured, your officers and soldiers immediately searched all our personal belongings, and even the sneakers on our feet were taken off. You used torture to force confessions from us, such as officers Chen Guangqin, Liu Guang, and dozens of others who were subjected to electric shock. When transporting us from the front to the rear, you did not give us food or water along the way, and we stayed overnight in the mud, which caused POWs to become sick and die. After we arrived at the POW camp, we were subjected to exhausting interrogations by your interrogation agencies - the Far East Intelligence Bureau. You used torture to force the feeder to admit that he was the commander, and interrogated the cook as the deputy division commander, and even forced the fishermen to confess that they were naval rear admirals. You completely violated the provisions of the Geneva Convention that prisoners of war must not be forced to confess. You deliberately insulted our personality. In July 1951, you forced us to wear red short clothes and pants worn by death row prisoners in the Chinese feudal era, and often stripped us of our clothes, pants, shoes, and hats in the name of checking the weight, so that we were naked outdoors, and your officers and soldiers laughed beside us. Regardless of the cold or heat, day and night, you forced us to perform labor. POWs were injured or killed due to being forced to engage in dangerous work and were often subjected to beatings, abuses, and even killings by your officers and soldiers during labor. Due to overwork, hunger, and cold, many POWs became disabled and sick. Regarding our living treatment, you have always adopted a starvation policy, providing only a small amount of crude barley, wheat, rice, and rotten fish every day, and each person ate less than half a bowl per meal. Since October 1952, you have never provided any edible oils. Due to lack of nutrition, most POWs suffer from night blindness. As for clothing, the clothes you issued could neither cover the skin nor keep out the cold. As a result, a large number of POWs were frostbitten. The living conditions were extremely bad. We slept on the damp ground for a long time, and the number of people was crowded. There were no bunks or straw mats, so many people suffered from arthritis and various skin diseases.

The memorandum said: You trained a group of special agents in Tokyo, Japan, and sent them to POW camps to serve as regimental commanders, various level captains, and teachers, and colluded with the special agent "Mr. Zhang" sent by Taiwan, and pastors such as Wu Boli (American) and Han Binghe (Korean) who used religion as a cover, to carry out special agent activities in the POW camp, control the entire POW camp, and persecute all POWs. They organized reactionary organizations such as the "Kuomintang 63rd Branch" and the "Anti-Communist Salvation League" in the POW camp, forced us to sing reactionary songs, and forced us to carry out reactionary education. You also forced us to put blood fingerprints on the so-called list of those who wanted to go to Taiwan, and forced us to tattoo, and everyone must have the word "anti-Communist" tattooed on their arms. Those who did not sign or tattoo would be subjected to torture.

The memorandum then condemned the U.S. side's crime of forcibly "screening" POWs. The memorandum said that on April 8, 1952, you implemented the so-called "review" (that is, illegal screening) that had been arranged long ago. In advance, you sent a batch of knives to special agent Wang Shunqing and others through "Pastor" Wu Boli, etc., with the word "US" engraved on the handles. On the eve of the "screening," you killed the POWs Yang Wenhua, Lin Xuepu, etc., and dug out the hearts and livers of Yang Wenhua and Lin Xuepu, threatening the POWs, "Whoever dares to return to the country will have the same result." During the "screening" process, more than 100 POWs including Cai Pingsheng were cut with knives, and countless people were beaten, almost no one was spared, so that many POWs did not dare to express their true desire to return to the country. After the forced "screening," under the command of POW camp commander Bonner, you carried out a series of massacres against us. Before leaving office, Bonner also personally went to Jeju Island and secretly ordered his subordinates to use a high degree of military pressure on the POWs. You also often sent armed soldiers into the POW camp day and night to provoke us. The occurrence of major and minor bloody cases in the POW camp was caused by your policy.

The memorandum described the massacre on Jeju Island on October 1st last year. The memorandum said: Bonner said in a memorandum to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war on June 2, "You can hang the national flag on National Day." In advance, the POW camp management authorities also automatically provided us with materials for making the national flag. Before October 1st, we had notified the POW camp authorities several times, but you had never refused and acquiesced. Therefore, it was completely legal for us to hang the flag to celebrate National Day on October 1st. Unexpectedly, after we hung the flag, the entire POW camp was surrounded by tanks. A large team of U.S. armed soldiers, under the command of Colonel Blackmore, began a savage and cowardly massacre. As a result, 56 POWs were killed and 109 were injured. This deliberate massacre, which created opportunities and was carried out in a planned manner, is not only an unprecedented war crime in the modern war history of the U.S. military, but its means of despicable are unimaginable to civilized humans.

The memorandum said: After the October 1st massacre, the POW camp management authorities further adopted collective punishment against us. In addition to often deducting food and drinking water for various reasons and making us collectively rain, you also adopted various penalties against us. For example, on October 7th last year, the POW camp authorities used armed soldiers to drive out all the POWs in the 5th camp, fined them for weeding, and transported all the food away. Then U.S. Army Captain Brooks publicly beat officer Luo Xingyi and forced him to climb the mountain (at that time, Hoffman, a representative of the "International Committee of the Red Cross," was present). Luo Xingyi refused to accept this insult, was beaten to the ground at the time, and was dragged out by armed soldiers and sent to prison. Your various atrocities fully demonstrate that you have always wanted to use your own policy of terror to replace the humanitarian principles stipulated in the Geneva Convention.

The memorandum also described the U.S. side's abuse of POWs in prisons and hospitals. The memorandum said that POWs were beaten when they entered prison. The prison doors were locked tightly, and there was no sunlight. Eating, defecation, and sleeping were all in one small room, and often only one meal was eaten a day. The so-called hospital is actually an experimental institute for American medical personnel. Many POWs were maimed or suffered from chronic diseases by your surgical experiments. In the Busan POW hospital, you fitted disabled POWs with rubber prosthetic legs, but after taking photos, you forcibly took back the prosthetic legs. Because you still treated POWs inhumanely in the hospital, countless POWs died in the hospital. The memorandum finally said that what is mentioned above is only one ten-thousandth of your atrocities. People all over the world can see that you have violated the Geneva Convention and committed bloody crimes of massacring and abusing POWs.

    志愿军被俘人员向克拉克提出备忘录
    抗议美方强迫扣留和虐待战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城二十二日电】归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员今天交给本社记者一份致联合国军总司令克拉克的备忘录，抗议美方强迫扣留战俘和虐待战俘的血腥暴行。这份备忘录已在七月二十七日晚八时由济州岛第八号战俘营中的中国人民志愿军被俘人员递交给该战俘营的美军上尉赛洛斯。八月五日和十一日，中国人民志愿军被俘人员又以同样的文本各一本，在汶山递交给联合红十字会小组美方代表，请其转交给克拉克。
    备忘录首先指出：本备忘录目的在提供朝鲜战争以来联合国军方面战俘营的生活实况，以作为二十世纪文明与野蛮的分野及历史审判的证言。
    备忘录说：当我们被俘时，你们的官兵即将我们的私人财物全部搜走，甚至穿在脚上的球鞋也被脱去。你们对我们用酷刑逼取口供，如被俘的军官陈光钦、刘光等数十人就曾受过电刑。在由前线向后方运送时，你们沿途不给我们食物和饮水，夜宿污泥之中，以致造成战俘生病与死亡。我们在到达战俘营以后，更遭到你们审讯机关——远东情报局的疲劳审问。你们用酷刑迫使饲养员承认为司令员，将炊事员审成副师长，更用刑迫令渔民招认为海军少将，你们完全违反了日内瓦公约的不得向战俘逼取口供的规定。你们蓄意侮辱我们的人格。在一九五一年七月，你们强制我们穿着中国封建时代死囚所穿的红色的短衣裤，并经常以检查过磅为名，脱光我们的衣裤鞋帽，使我们赤身露体在室外行动，你们的官兵则在旁嬉笑。你们无论寒暑，不分昼夜地强迫我们服劳役。战俘因被迫从事危险工作而死伤并经常在劳役中遭受你方官兵的毒打恶骂甚至杀伤。由于劳役过度，饥寒交迫，许多战俘成为残废和病夫。对我们的生活待遇，你们一贯采取饥饿政策，每日只供给少量粗劣的大麦、小麦、大米、烂鱼，每人每餐所吃的不足半碗。一九五二年十月之后，你们从未供给丝毫食用油类。由于营养缺乏，多数战俘患夜盲症。关于衣著，你们所发的衣服，既不能遮肤，更不能御寒。因而使大批战俘冻伤。居住条件极端恶劣，我们长期睡在潮湿的土地上，而且人数拥挤，既无铺板，又缺草席，以致许多人患关节炎和各种皮肤病。
    备忘录说：你们曾在日本东京训练了一批特务，派他们到战俘营里来分任联队长、各级队长、教员等工作，并与台湾派来的特务“张先生”，和以宗教为掩护的牧师如吴博礼（美籍）、韩秉赫（朝鲜籍）勾结一起，在战俘营进行特务活动，控制整个战俘营，迫害所有战俘。他们在战俘营中组织“国民党六三支部”、“反共救国同盟会”等反动组织，强迫我们唱反动歌曲，对我们强迫进行反动教育。你们并强迫我们在所谓要求到台湾去的名册上盖血指印，并强迫我们刺字，每个人必须臂上刺有“反共”字样。如有不签名不刺字者，都要遭到酷刑。
    备忘录接着谴责美方强迫“甄别”战俘的罪行。备忘录说，一九五二年四月八日，你们实行了早已布置好的所谓“审查”（即非法甄别）。事先你们经由“牧师”吴博礼等将刀一批送给特务王顺清等，刀柄上刻有“US”字样。“审查”的前夕，你们即将战俘杨文华、林学普等杀死，并将杨文华、林学普的心肝挖出，恐吓战俘们说：“谁敢回国，同样结果。”在“甄别”过程中，战俘蔡平生等一百余人被割肉，无数人遭毒打，几乎无人幸免，以致许多战俘不敢说出自己要求回国的真实愿望。强迫“审查”以后，你们在战俘营司令波纳指挥之下，对我们进行了一连串的大屠杀。波纳在离职前，还亲往济州岛密令所属对战俘使用高度的军事压力。你们并经常派遣武装士兵，不分昼夜地进入战俘营，向我们进行挑衅。战俘营中大小血案的发生，都是你们这种政策所造成的。
    备忘录叙述了去年十月一日济州岛上的大屠杀。备忘录说：波纳在六月二日致中国人民志愿军被俘人员的备忘录中曾称：“你等可于国庆日悬挂国旗。”事先，战俘营管理当局并且自动供给我们制作国旗用的材料。在十月一日以前，我们曾数度通知战俘营当局，但你们一直没有拒绝，予以默许。因此，我们在十月一日悬旗庆祝国庆是完全合法的。不料我们悬旗以后，全战俘营即被坦克包围。大队美军武装士兵在白乐摩上校指挥之下，开始了野蛮而卑怯的大屠杀。结果战俘五十六人被杀死，一百零九名负伤。这种故意制造机会有计划进行的大屠杀，不仅是美军在近代战争史上空前的战争罪行，其手段之卑鄙，实为文明人类所不能想像。
    备忘录说：十月一日大屠杀后，战俘营管理当局更进一步对我们采取集体处罚的手段。你们除经常借故克扣粮食和饮水，使我们集体淋雨以外，并对我们采用多种刑罚。例如，去年十月七日，战俘营当局以武装士兵将第五号营场全体战俘赶出，罚他们拔草，并将粮食全部运走。接着美军上尉布鲁克斯当众毒打军官骆星一，并强迫他爬山（当时有“红十字国际委员会”代表霍夫曼在场）。骆星一拒绝接受此种侮辱，当时被打得昏倒在地，并被武装士兵拖出送往监狱。你们的种种暴行，完全说明你们一贯想用自己的恐怖政策来代替日内瓦公约所规定的人道原则。
    备忘录还叙述了美方在监狱和医院中虐待战俘的情形。备忘录说，战俘入狱时必遭毒打。监狱内牢门紧锁，不见天日，饮食、大小便、睡觉都在一斗室之中，每日经常只吃一餐。所谓医院，实际上是美国医务人员的实验所。许多战俘被你们的手术实验弄成残废或患了慢性病症。在釜山战俘医院，你们曾给残废战俘装上胶制假腿，但在照相以后，你们就将假腿强迫收回。由于你们在医院中仍然以非人道待遇对待战俘，因此战俘住院致死者不知凡几。备忘录最后说，以上所述仅为你方暴行的万分之一，全世界人民都可看到：你们违反日内瓦公约，犯下了屠杀和虐待战俘的血腥罪行。
