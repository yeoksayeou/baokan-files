    Soviet Academy of Sciences' Institute of Oriental Studies
    Begins Compiling "A History of China"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th] TASS reports from Moscow: The Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has begun collectively compiling "A History of China." "Soviet Culture Newspaper" recently published an interview with the Deputy Director of the Institute, E. Kovalev, regarding the compilation of this book.
    E. Kovalev said: "A History of China" will discuss China's history from ancient times to the present, spanning a very long period. This kind of massive undertaking is a first for the Soviet Union. Many Soviet historians, linguists, and economists are participating in the compilation of this book. Currently, Dr. of Economic Sciences V. Maslennikov and Master of Economic Sciences V. Nikiforov are responsible for beginning the compilation of "A History of Modern China." "A History of Modern China" will particularly emphasize the struggle of the Chinese people to establish a free, people's democratic China, opposing imperialism, domestic reactionaries, and the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The book will also devote considerable space to discussing the establishment of New China and the history of the increasingly strengthened friendly relations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China. In addition to "A History of Modern China," the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences will successively publish "A History of Ancient China," "A History of Medieval China," and "A History of Modern China."
    Concurrently with the compilation of "A History of China," the Institute of Oriental Studies will also publish "Problems of Chinese Lexicography" by Dr. of Linguistics I. Oshannin, as well as papers on "Problems of Chinese Linguistics," research on Chinese grammar, and Professor Kolokolov's popular booklet "Modern Chinese Writing" (hieroglyphs and their reform).

    苏联科学院东方学研究所
    开始编纂“中国历史”
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院东方学研究所，已开始集体编纂“中国历史”。“苏维埃文化报”最近发表该研究所副所长埃·科瓦列夫就编纂这本书对记者发表的谈话。
    埃·科瓦列夫说：“中国历史”这本书要论述中国从太古到现在的历史，时间很长。这样巨大的工作在苏联还是第一次。苏联的许多历史学家、语言学家、经济学家，都参加了这本书的编纂工作。现在，已经由经济科学博士维·马斯连尼科夫和经济科学硕士维·尼基福罗夫负责开始编纂“中国现代史”。在“中国现代史”中，将特别着重说明中国人民为争取建立自由的人民民主的中国、反对帝国主义、反对国内反动派和蒋介石卖国匪帮而斗争的情况。该书还将以很大篇幅论述新中国的建立和苏中两国人民之间的友好关系日益加强的历史。除了“中国现代史”外，苏联科学院东方学研究所还将陆续出版“中国古代史”、“中国中古史”、“中国近代史”等书。
    和编纂“中国历史”同时，东方学研究所还将出版苏联语言科学博士伊·奥夏宁的“中国辞的问题”，以及“中国语言学问题”、中文文法研究等论文，和科洛柯洛夫教授的通俗小册子“中国现代文字”（象形文字及其改革问题）等。
