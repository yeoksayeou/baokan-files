The exploration of petroleum resources in Southwest China is rapidly developing under the strong leadership of the People's Government, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, and the support of the broad masses of the people. The famous Sichuan Basin, as well as Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, are all areas suitable for oil storage and possess abundant natural gas resources.

After the liberation of Southwest China, the People's Government paid attention to the investigation and exploration of petroleum resources in Southwest China, sending out many geological workers to identify favorable petroleum geological structures. In 1951, the first school for training petroleum industry cadres in Southwest China – the Southwest Petroleum Industry School – and various training courses were established. At the same time, in cooperation with Southwest universities and colleges, specialized departments such as petroleum geology and petroleum drilling were established, cultivating a large number of talents for the exploration of petroleum resources.

With the start of large-scale economic construction in the country, the exploration of petroleum resources in Southwest China also entered a new historical period. The annual plans for geological exploration, geophysical exploration, and deep-well drilling of petroleum resources in Southwest China have been formulated according to the instructions of the Central People's Government, with the assistance of Soviet petroleum experts, and based on the most advanced Soviet petroleum science theories and working methods, according to the distribution of petroleum resources in Southwest China. This year, several areas in the Sichuan Basin will begin deep-well drilling on an unprecedented scale in the history of Southwest China's petroleum industry. The drilling depth in half a year will greatly exceed the total drilling depth in the thirteen years before liberation. Highway projects in various new exploration areas and water storage projects with a capacity of over 9,000 tons have been completed or are about to be completed as scheduled. Thousands of tons of various machines and steel materials are being transported continuously to various areas where they are needed by trains, ships, automobiles, or other means of transportation and manpower. Tall new drilling rigs imported from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries have been erected on the construction sites of many exploration areas.

The first petroleum exploration well after the liberation of Southwest China officially started drilling on June 15 this year in a certain exploration area in central Sichuan. The efficiency of drilling engineering in 1953 will be more than four times higher than the average engineering efficiency before liberation. In order to expand new exploration areas for annual petroleum drilling, a large number of geological exploration and geophysical exploration workers are searching for new petroleum geological structures in vast areas.

The petroleum exploration work has received strong support from the Chinese Communist Party organizations and governments at all levels, organizations, and groups, as well as the broad masses of the people in various parts of Southwest China. Responsible cadres of many local governments personally participated in the responsible work of highway construction in the exploration areas; introduced local conditions to geological exploration teams; notified district and township cadres to assist in the work, mobilized the masses to report mineral deposits, and instructed relevant departments to assist in solving the problem of labor shortages. Petroleum exploration workers have established close ties with the vast number of farmers and people from all walks of life in various places, and have received a lot of assistance. Many people automatically boil water and cook meals for field geological personnel, take care of equipment, lead the way, and look for oil seepages.

In the past three months, many letters reporting oil and gas seepages have been received from people all over the country; some have attached topographical sketches or stratigraphic profiles, and stone layer and oil sand samples and soaked paper samples on the letters, and some have directly sent oil seepage samples. According to the results of investigation and research, most of these mineral reporting materials are authentic and reliable, and have made great contributions to the development of petroleum resources in Southwest China.

    西南石油资源探勘工作迅速发展
    西南石油资源探勘工作，正在人民政府大力领导、苏联的帮助和广大人民的支援下迅速发展。著名的四川盆地、及滇黔桂等地，都是适于藏油的地区，并蕴藏有丰富的天然气的资源。
    西南解放后，人民政府就注意了西南石油资源的调查探勘工作，派出了许多地质工作人员，查明了良好的石油地质构造。一九五一年又创办了西南第一所培养石油工业干部的学校——西南石油工业学校和各种训练班，同时又与西南高等学校合作创办了石油地质、石油钻探等专业科系，为石油资源的探勘工作培养大量人材。
    随着国家大规模经济建设的开始，西南石油资源探勘工作也开始了新的历史时期。西南石油资源的地质探勘、地球物理探勘、深井钻探的逐年计划，已按照中央人民政府的指示，在苏联石油专家的帮助下，根据最先进的苏联石油科学理论及工作方法，按照西南石油资源分布情况制订出来了。今年内，四川盆地上的几个地区将开始西南石油史上空前规模的深井钻探，半年的钻探深度将大大超过解放前十三年钻探总深度。各个新探区的公路工程和蓄量九千吨以上的储水工程，业已如期完工和即将完工。千吨以上的各种机器和钢铁材料，正用火车、轮船、汽车或其他交通工具及人力源源不断的运到各个需用地区。许多探区工地上已架好高大的从苏联和人民民主国家运来的新式钻机。
    西南解放后第一个石油探井已于今年六月十五日在四川中部某探区正式开钻。一九五三年钻井工程效率，将比解放前平均工程效率提高四倍以上。为了扩大逐年石油钻探的新探区，大批地质探勘及地球物理探勘工作者，正在广大地区寻找新的石油地质构造。
    石油探勘工作受到西南各地中国共产党的组织和各级人民政府、机关团体以及广大人民群众的大力支持。许多地方政府的负责干部，亲自参加探区公路修筑的负责工作；向地质探勘队介绍当地情况；通知区乡干部协助工作，发动群众报矿，指示有关部门协助解决缺乏工人问题。石油探勘工作者与各地广大农民和各阶层人民建立了密切联系，得到很多援助。许多群众自动为野外地质人员烧水做饭，看护器材，领路，找油苗。
    最近三个月来，收到许多来自各地群众报告油苗、气苗的信；有的并在信函上附了地形草图或地层剖面，和石层及油沙标本和浸过的纸样，也有直接送油苗样品的。这些报矿资料，根据调查研究结果，绝大部分都是真实可靠的，对西南石油资源的开发有很大贡献。
