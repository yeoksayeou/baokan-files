Xinhua News Agency, Biktong, July 7th: A Joint Red Cross Group of fifty-four people arrived in Biktong on the 6th. The group included representatives from the Red Cross Societies of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Turkey, Canada, and South Korea.

According to the Korean Armistice Agreement, these Red Cross personnel are to provide humanitarian services as needed for the welfare of prisoners of war.

Twenty-eight of these Red Cross representatives will travel from Biktong to inspect the prisoner of war camp holding non-Korean prisoners, while the remainder will inspect the prisoner of war camp holding South Korean prisoners in the Manpo area.

Although Korea has suffered severe war damage, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have arranged a comfortable train journey north for the Joint Red Cross Group personnel. Jerome, the British representative leading the personnel from the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Turkey, Canada, and South Korea, thanked our side for all these efforts, saying, "We are completely satisfied."

Six personnel from the Red Cross Societies of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, Denmark, the Philippines, and Australia in the Joint Red Cross Group remained in Kaesong to provide services for the prisoners of war being repatriated from North Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Biktong, August 8th: Personnel from the Joint Red Cross Group North Team today listened to detailed reports from the prisoner of war camp commanders of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers regarding the situation of the prisoner of war camps. This group is scheduled to go to the Changsong prisoner of war camp tomorrow morning.

General Wang Yangong, the prisoner of war camp commander, told the twenty-eight Red Cross representatives sent by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, Denmark, Turkey, Canada, and South Korea that prisoners of war have generally gained weight since being captured, which proves that they have received good treatment in the prisoner of war camps.

The prisoner of war camp commander cited many facts and figures to illustrate that, despite the extensive war damage, the prisoner of war camp authorities are still doing their best to improve the lives of the prisoners of war in accordance with the consistent policy of leniency towards prisoners of war advocated by the Korean-Chinese side.

    【新华社碧潼七日电】联合红十字会小组一行五十四人，在六日到达碧潼。小组中有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国、美国、英国、丹麦、土耳其、加拿大和南朝鲜的红十字会代表。
    根据朝鲜停战协定，这些红十字会人员是为提供战俘福利所需求的人道主义服务的。
    这些红十字会代表中，二十八人将由碧潼前往视察拘留非朝鲜籍俘虏的战俘营，其余的将视察在满浦地区拘留南朝鲜俘虏的战俘营。
    虽然朝鲜受到了严重的战争破坏，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军为联合红十字会小组人员乘火车北上的旅程安排得很舒适。率领美国、英国、丹麦、土耳其、加拿大和南朝鲜人员的英国代表朱洛姆感谢我方这一切努力，他说：“我们感到完全满意。”
    联合红十字会小组中的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国、丹麦、菲律宾和澳大利亚红十字会的六位人员，留在开城，以便对于从朝鲜北部来的将被遣返的战俘提供服务。
    【新华社碧潼八日电】联合红十字会小组北组的人员今天听取了朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的战俘营长官关于战俘营情况的详细报告。这批人员定于明天上午前往昌城战俘营。
    战俘营长官王央公将军告诉由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国、英国、美国、丹麦、土耳其、加拿大和南朝鲜等国家派来的二十八位红十字会代表说，战俘们自从被俘以后，一般来说都增加了体重，这证明了他们在战俘营里受到良好的待遇。
    战俘营长官引证了许多事实和数字，说明尽管战争造成很多破坏，战俘营当局仍然遵照朝中方面一贯主张的宽待战俘的政策，尽力改善战俘的生活。
