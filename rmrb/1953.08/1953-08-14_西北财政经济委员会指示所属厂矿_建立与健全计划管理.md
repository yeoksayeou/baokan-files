The Northwest Financial and Economic Committee Instructs Subordinate Factories and Mines to Establish and Improve Planning Management

[This newspaper reports] The Northwest Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee recently issued instructions on establishing and improving planning management in state-owned and local state-owned industries in the Northwest region, deciding to vigorously strengthen planning management in various factories and mines in the Northwest.

The instructions first described the execution of the Northwest region's industrial production plan in the first half of this year, pointing out that the majority of major state-owned, local state-owned, and joint state-private industrial enterprises in the Northwest region have exceeded or nearly completed their plans, with many improvements compared to the same period in 1952. However, there are still many, even serious, problems in enterprise management. Generally: product plans are completed well, but labor, finance, raw materials, and cost plans are completed poorly; the output plans for major products are completed, but technical and economic indicators are not completed, or not all completed. The completion situation is also uneven between factories and mines, and between months. Within factories and mines, workshops, processes, and ten-day periods cannot conduct rhythmic production. The instructions pointed out that the main reason for the above situation is insufficient understanding of the seriousness of the state plan, lack of attention to completing the overall plan, and lack of attention to business management. Therefore, in the second half of this year, under the general goal of striving to comprehensively and balancedly complete the state plan, it is necessary to establish and improve planning management, learn to manage modern industrial production with scientific methods, and improve the level of enterprise management.

The instructions pointed out: To realize planning management, we must first find out the crux of the problem that hinders the comprehensive and balanced completion of the state plan and the key to further improving production in each unit. In the process of finding and solving key problems in production, in order to be quick and accurate, it is necessary to mobilize the masses and carry out a series of activities such as rationalization proposals, finding tricks, and tapping potential. Because the key problems and weak links of each factory and mine are different, the specific content of planning management should not be prescribed in a uniform way. The instructions also specifically stipulated the general steps and main content for establishing and improving planning management in various factories and mines in the Northwest:

First, conscientiously study and make ideological preparations, which is the primary key to doing a good job in planning management. It is necessary to make all employees understand the important significance of comprehensively and balancedly completing the state plan. It is necessary to make all employees understand the content, purpose, requirements, and methods of planning management.

Second, establish and improve planning and statistical organizations and production management organizations. At present, major factories and mines in the Northwest region have established planning and statistical organizations or set up full-time cadres, but only a very few planning units are strong, and generally the business level is low, and the daily work is mainly compiling annual plans and some minor businesses in planning work, which cannot meet the requirements of planning management. Therefore, state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines must quickly strengthen planning organizations or full-time cadres, and strengthen the leadership of planning departments, so that they become the most powerful assistants to factory and mine directors.

Third, mobilize the masses to discuss the plan, deliberate and find out key problems. Under the goal of comprehensively and balancedly completing and exceeding the state plan, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to find weak links and key problems, and provide rationalization proposals to break through and improve these weak links and key problems, so that the plan has advanced nature and specific content, so as to facilitate the signing of contracts and the development of production competitions. Therefore, state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines are required to comprehensively check the plans of their units. For those who have completed the plan well or close to completing the plan in the first half of the year, they are required to revise the backward quotas and indicators, tap potential, and mobilize the masses to discuss the quarterly and monthly plans under the principle of comprehensively and balancedly completing and exceeding the state plan; for those factories and mines that have completed the plan poorly in the first half of the year, they are required to combine the annual plan, conscientiously mobilize the masses to conduct discussions, find out the key problems that hinder the completion of the plan, and propose solutions, and effectively improve and implement them when discussing the quarterly and monthly plans in the second half of the year, so as to strive to complete the state's annual plan. In carrying out these tasks, it is necessary to mobilize the staff of various departments to go deep into the masses, organize them to actively check their respective weak links and key problems, and propose improvement methods.

Fourth, prepare operation plans. Some state-owned factories and mines in the Northwest region have successively had operation plans and some instruction charts since 1952, which has greatly advanced production management, but these tasks are not yet sound, so the production plan cannot be completed comprehensively and balancedly. Some only have output and man-hour plans, lacking the coordination of technical measures, tools, materials, maintenance and other related plans, so they are often disrupted in execution. Some only have technical measures, lacking relevant planning indicators. Some have monthly average indicators, lacking more specific weekly and daily plan figures. Some indicators are more comprehensive, but the time to determine the operation plan each month is late, and the phenomenon of being loose in the first and middle ten days and tight in the last ten days of production cannot be overcome. Therefore, based on the key problems that the masses have found that hinder production from completing the plan, checking the original records and quota management work, and preparing the operation plan should be the central content of establishing and improving planning management in state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines at present.

Fifth, strengthen scheduling work and plan inspection system. At present, another reason why the plan execution of some factories and mines in the Northwest region is not good is that there is a lack of guarantee in the execution after the plan is prepared, that is, there is a lack of scheduling and inspection work in daily actual production activities. Therefore, in the future, larger factories and mines should generally establish scheduling organizations within the production and technology organizations.

The instructions also stipulated that the heads of the Northwest's competent professional departments and the financial committees and industrial bureaus of various provinces (cities) must take responsibility, take immediate action, personally lead the study and deployment of the work of subordinate units, and effectively lead and promote this work.

    西北财政经济委员会指示所属厂矿
    建立与健全计划管理
    【本报讯】西北行政委员会财政经济委员会日前发出了关于西北区国营与地方国营工业建立与健全计划管理的指示，决定在西北各厂矿中大力加强计划管理工作。
    指示首先叙述了今年上半年西北区工业生产计划执行的情况，指出西北区多数主要国营、地方国营、公私合营工业都已超额或接近完成计划，较一九五二年同期已有很多改进。但企业管理方面还存在着不少的甚至是严重的问题。一般的是：产品计划完成好，劳动、财务、原材料、成本计划完成差；主要产品的产量计划完成了，但技术经济指标没有完成，或没有全部完成。在厂矿之间，月度之间完成情况也不均衡。在厂矿内部车间、工序和旬度之间不能进行有节奏的生产。指示指出：产生以上情况的主要原因，是由于对国家计划的严肃性认识不够，不重视完成全面计划，不重视经营管理工作。因此，今年下半年就必须在争取全面地均衡地完成国家计划的总目标下，建立与健全计划管理，学会以科学的方法管理近代化的工业生产，提高企业管理水平。
    指示指出：实现计划管理首先要在各单位中找出阻碍全面地均衡地完成国家计划的症结和进一步提高生产的关键。在寻找和解决生产中的关键问题时，为了迅速与准确，必须发动群众，开展合理化建议、找窍门、挖潜力等一系列的工作，由于每个厂矿的关键问题及薄弱环节是不相同的，所以计划管理的具体内容不宜千篇一律的规定。指示中并具体规定了西北各厂矿建立与健全计划管理的一般步骤和主要内容：
    第一，认真学习，做好思想准备工作，是做好计划管理的首要关键。必须使全体职工了解全面地均衡地完成国家计划的重要意义。必须使全体职工了解计划管理的内容、目的、要求与作法。
    第二，建立与健全计划统计机构和生产管理机构。现在西北区主要厂矿都已建立了计划统计机构或设置了专职干部，但较强的计划单位还是极少数，普遍是业务水平低，且日常工作主要是编年度计划和一些计划工作中的次要业务，这样就不能适应计划管理的要求。因此，国营及地方国营厂矿必须迅速加强计划机构或专职干部，并加强对计划部门的领导，使之成为厂矿长的最有力的助手。
    第三，发动群众讨论计划，酝酿并找出关键问题。要在为了全面地均衡地完成与超过国家计划的目标下，发动群众寻找薄弱环节与关键问题，并提供突破和改进这些薄弱环节与关键问题的合理化建议，从而使计划具备先进的性质和具体的内容，以便于订立合同和展开生产竞赛。因此，要求国营及地方国营厂矿对于本单位的计划加以全面检查。对于那些上半年完成计划较好的或接近完成计划的，要求其修订落后定额与指标，挖掘潜力，在为全面地均衡地完成并超过国家计划的原则下，发动群众讨论季度与月度计划；对于那些上半年完成计划较差的厂矿，要求其结合全年计划，切实发动群众进行讨论，找出阻碍完成计划的关键问题并提出解决的措施来，在讨论下半年逐季逐月的计划时，切实予以改进与贯彻，从而争取完成国家的年度计划。在进行这些工作中，必须发动各科室人员深入群众，组织他们主动检查各自有关的薄弱环节与关键问题并提出改进办法。
    第四，编制作业计划。西北区部分国营厂矿自一九五二年开始已陆续有了作业计划和部分指示图表，使生产管理大进一步，但这些工作还不健全，因而生产计划仍不能全面、均衡地完成。有的只有产量与工时计划，缺少技术措施、工具材料、检修等有关计划的配合，因之在执行中常被打乱。有的只有技术措施，缺少有关的计划指标。有的则有全月平均指标，缺少较具体的每周、每日的计划数字。有的指标虽较全面，但每月确定作业计划时间晚，对生产中上旬松下旬紧的现象不能克服。因此，根据群众找出来的阻碍生产完不成计划的关键问题，检查原始纪录和定额管理工作，编出作业计划，应作为国营及地方国营厂矿目前建立与健全计划管理的中心内容。
    第五，加强调度工作与计划检查制度。目前，西北区一些厂矿计划执行情况不好的另一个原因，就是计划编制后缺少执行中的保证，即缺少在日常实际生产活动中的调度与检查工作。因此今后较大的厂矿一般应在生产技术机构内设立调度机构。
    指示并规定西北各主管专业部门与各省（市）财委及工业厅（局）必须由首长负责，立即行动起来，亲自领导学习与布置所属单位的工作，并切实领导与推动这一工作。
