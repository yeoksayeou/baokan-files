	The Beijing Institute of Geology Should Not Long-Term Stockpile Useful Machinery

	Sun Xiaoqing from the Beijing Institute of Geology writes: Before and after the reorganization of departments and colleges, the former Engineering College of Peking University transferred to our institute two large steam engines and a sixteen-foot long gear lathe. These machines are still stockpiled in our school's warehouse and are beginning to rust due to poor storage. However, I understand that many production departments or basic construction units urgently need these machines. For example, recently when we went to a drilling site for an internship, we saw that the repair shop there did not have such a large lathe. When the drill pipe at the construction site was damaged, they had to use a car to send it to a factory more than 300 kilometers away for repair. I believe that if our school does not need these machines in the short term, we should submit a request to the higher-level leading organs to allocate them to units that need them; if our school needs these machines, we should also take good care of them.

	The situation of colleges and universities stockpiling materials and causing losses to state property was exposed during the "Three-Anti" movement; but this situation may still exist at present, and our school's stockpiling of machinery is one example. I hope readers everywhere will vigorously expose this phenomenon so that state assets can be reasonably utilized.

### 北京地质学院不应长期积压有用的机器

专栏：读者来信摘要

    北京地质学院不应长期积压有用的机器
    北京地质学院孙孝庆来信：原北京大学工学院在院系调整前后移交给我院大型蒸汽机两架，一丈六尺长齿轮大车床一部。这些机器至今仍积压在我校仓库中，同时由于保管不善而开始生锈。但是据我了解，有不少生产部门或基本建设单位却急需这些机器。如最近我们到某钻探工地实习，见到那里的修配厂因为没有这样大的车床，当工地的钻杆损坏时，只好用汽车送到离工地三百多公里外的工厂去修理。我认为，如果我校在短期内用不到这些机器，就应该呈请上级领导机关把它们调拨给需要的单位去使用；如果我校需用这批机器，也应该很好加以保管才对。
    高等学校积压物资使国家财产遭受损失的情况，在“三反”运动中曾被揭发过；但这种情况在目前还可能存在，我校积压机器就是其中一例。希望各地读者大力揭发这种现象，使国家资财能得到合理的利用。
