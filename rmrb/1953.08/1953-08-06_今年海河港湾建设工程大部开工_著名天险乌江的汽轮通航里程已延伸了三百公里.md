    Steamboat navigation mileage on the treacherous Wujiang River has been extended by 300 kilometers.

    [Reported by this newspaper] Most of the seaport and harbor construction projects in our country have started one after another this year.
    Our country has a long coastline and numerous excellent rivers. In the three years since liberation, the restoration of seaports and harbors has been largely completed. Navigable channels have been restored after three years of vigorous dredging, and the renovation of major port terminals nationwide has been basically completed, with the addition of new terminals and warehouse facilities. New ports and terminals have been built along the Songhua River, and the first phase of the Tanggu New Port project has been completed. This year, to support large-scale economic construction, the construction of seaports and harbors has been proportionally increased, with the total amount of work doubling compared to last year. This includes the construction and restoration of various types of wharves totaling approximately 2,800 meters in length, breakwaters totaling approximately 1,478 meters in length, dredging of over 10.7 million cubic meters of navigation channels, construction of new warehouses and storage yards totaling 70,300 square meters, seafarers' hospitals, dormitories, and other buildings totaling 138,900 square meters, and a plan to salvage over 20 sunken ships, totaling approximately 18,000 tons. Currently, four of the five key seaport construction projects have started one after another.

    This year, the focus of seaport and harbor construction in our country, in addition to strengthening national defense, is on the construction of Huangpu Port in South China to accommodate the port's increasing cargo throughput. Dredging of the intermediate terminal has begun, and the construction of the rock breakwater is progressing according to plan. Rear warehouses and platform canopies have been completed according to plan, and the inner and outer channels are being dredged according to plan. In North China, the focus is on the construction of Tanggu New Port. The depth of the inner and outer channels of the port has generally reached minus seven meters below zero, and the water depth in the anchorage exceeds minus ten meters below zero, allowing large ships with a draft of 8.2 meters (27 feet) to safely enter the port for loading and unloading. The main projects of the port this year are the construction of warehouses and storage yards, the construction of breakwaters, and the implementation of regular dredging to ensure the depth of the channel. The first phase of the port has now been completed.

    In addition to focusing on seaport construction projects this year, special attention has been paid to the construction of the Sichuan River to ensure navigation safety and improve towing efficiency. Survey work on the Sichuan River has begun and the preliminary design and partial technical design of Chongqing Port will be completed by the end of this year.

    (Xinhua News Agency) Due to the Sichuan Provincial Inland Water Navigation Administration's renovation projects on the Wujiang River last winter and this spring, including surveying, blasting reefs, inspecting beaches, and repairing towpaths, the river channel is now deeper, wider, and more stable than before. Recently, the inland trial steamboat in Sichuan Province was able to break through the natural barrier of the Wujiang River, including the Nine Dams and Thirteen Gorges, and the 60-li-long Longmen Gorge, crossing dangerous shoals such as Yantan and Dayintan, and navigating 90 kilometers upstream from Pengshui County to Gongtan, at the border of Sichuan and Guizhou provinces. As a result, the steamboat navigation mileage on the famous treacherous Wujiang River has been extended by 300 kilometers. In the future, when regular navigation between Pengshui and Gongtan is established, ships will be able to make five round trips per month, allowing local specialties such as tung oil, wood oil, lacquer, gallnuts, hemp, and dolomite produced along the river to be transported smoothly from the Wujiang River to the Yangtze River, no longer frequently stockpiling in Gongtan; and the salt and industrial products needed by the vast population in several counties along the river can also be transported in from the Wujiang River in greater quantities.

    The Wujiang River originates in the Wumeng Mountains of Guizhou Province, runs through the hinterland of Guizhou, passes through Pengshui, Wulong, and other counties in the southeastern corner of Sichuan, and joins the Yangtze River at Fuling. It is the main external transportation line for seventeen counties along the river. However, the Wujiang River channel is the most dangerous, with a water level difference of 91.8 meters in the 300-kilometer section from Fuling to Gongtan. The current is fierce and turbulent, and there are many hidden reefs and dangerous shoals in the river, making navigation very inconvenient. In the past, the best wooden boats could only make five round trips a year, and even then it was very dangerous.

### 今年海河港湾建设工程大部开工  著名天险乌江的汽轮通航里程已延伸了三百公里

    今年海河港湾建设工程大部开工
    著名天险乌江的汽轮通航里程已延伸了三百公里
    【本报讯】我国今年大部分海河港湾建设工程已先后开工。
    我国有漫长的海岸线和众多的优良河川。解放三年多来，海河港湾的恢复工作大体已近完成。航道经过三年来的大力疏浚，都已先后恢复通航，全国主要港湾码头的整治工作也已基本完成，并增建了新的码头和仓库设备。松花江沿岸新建了一些港口和码头，塘沽新港第一期工程也已完工。今年为配合大规模经济建设，海河港湾建设工程也按比例地增大，工程总量较去年增加了一倍，其中包括新建和恢复各式码头长约二千八百公尺，防波堤长约一千四百七十八公尺，航道挖泥一千零七十余万立方公尺，新建仓库、货场七万零三百平方公尺，海员医院、宿舍及其他房屋十三万八千九百余平方公尺，并计划打捞沉船二十余艘，约一万八千余吨。目前五个重点海港建设工程，已有四处先后开工。
    今年我国海河港湾建设的重点，除了加强国防建设外，在华南着重于黄浦港的建设，以适应该港日益增长的货物吞吐量，目前中级码头已开始挖泥，挖石坝也正在按计划进行，后方仓库、月台雨棚，都已按计划完工，并正在按计划疏浚内外航道。华北方面着重于塘沽新港的建设。该港内外航道深度已普遍达到零下负七公尺，停泊地水深则超过零下负十公尺，吃水八点二公尺（二十七英尺），巨轮已能安全进港装卸货物。今年该港主要工程是建立仓库和货场，修建防波堤，进行经常的挖泥工作以保证该航道的深度，现该港第一期工程已经完成。
    今年除了着重海港建设工程外，又特别注意川江的建设工作以保证航行安全，提高拖运效率。现川江的勘测工作已开始进行，今年年底可完成重庆港的初步设计和部分技术设计。
    【新华社讯】由于四川省内河航运管理局去年冬天和今年春天在乌江进行了勘测、炸礁、检滩、修纤道等整修工程，使河道比过去深广平稳；四川省内河试航轮船最近得以突破乌江天险的九堰十三峡和长达六十里的龙门峡，渡过沿滩、大银滩等重重险滩，从彭水县上溯了九十公里，航行到四川和贵州两省交界的龚滩。至此，著名天险乌江的汽轮通航里程已延伸了三百公里。将来彭水和龚滩之间正式通航以后，轮船每月可来回五趟，沿河出产的桐油、木油、漆、棓子、麻、白云石等土特产品就可从乌江畅运长江，不再经常积压在龚滩；沿河几县广大人民所需的食盐和工业品也可较充分地由乌江运输进来。
    乌江起源于贵州省的乌蒙山，横贯贵州腹地，经四川东南角的彭水、武隆等县到涪陵和长江会合，是沿江十七个县的主要对外交通线。但是，乌江河道最为险恶，自涪陵到龚滩三百公里的一段，水位相差达九十一点八公尺，水势凶猛湍急，河中暗礁险滩很多，船只航行很不方便。过去最好的木船一年只能来回五趟，而且十分危险。
