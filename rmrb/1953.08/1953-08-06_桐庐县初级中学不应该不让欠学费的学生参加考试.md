	Tonglu County Junior High School Should Not Prevent Students Who Owe Tuition from Taking Exams
	Dai Yuchu, Zhao Shilin, and Wu Ziqiang from the Tonglu Purchasing Station of the Zhejiang Forestry Industry Bureau write: Tonglu County Junior High School is using the method of not allowing students to take exams to pressure them to pay outstanding fees. The facts are as follows: Recently, as the school's semester exams approached, some students had not paid their tuition and miscellaneous fees in full, or had some arrears. Li Kangkai, the principal of the school, announced to the students: "If the tuition and miscellaneous fees for this semester are not paid in full, you will not be allowed to take the semester exams, nor will you be allowed to take make-up exams, and you will be held back a grade." As a result, these students who had not paid their tuition and miscellaneous fees due to family financial difficulties were burdened with ideological baggage, and ran outside the school all day to borrow money during the study period. For example, a student surnamed Ma owed part of his tuition and miscellaneous fees and was forced to rush to FenShui County, eighty miles away from Tonglu, to borrow money, which took him four days to go back and forth. In the end, he was only 20,000 yuan short, but the school's office director still did not allow him to take the exam. The student had no choice but to run to our station at ten o'clock the night before the exam to borrow money. At that time, we didn't have enough money, and we promised to send it to him the next day. After the student returned to school, he asked the administrative office to let him take the exam the next day first, and he guaranteed to pay the tuition and miscellaneous fees in full that day; but he still did not get permission. As a result, the student was forced to rush to our station at five o'clock the next morning to get the money, and the school allowed him to take the exam. The school had already started the exams on July 6th, but there were still eight students who could not take the exams because of this.
	We believe that this practice of Tonglu County Junior High School is very inappropriate. This has seriously affected the students' learning mood and health, caused chaos in school life, and given the masses a very bad impression. We hope that the local leading organs will investigate this issue and give the students who were forced not to take the exam the opportunity to take a make-up exam.
	Editor's Note: Tonglu County Junior High School's method of forcing students to pay outstanding fees by not allowing them to take exams is very inappropriate. Strictly abiding by school rules and regulations and paying various fees on time is an obligation that self-funded students should fulfill; however, judging from the current actual situation, the phenomenon of some self-funded students owing fees due to temporary financial difficulties or other reasons still exists today. In order to solve this problem, the correct approach for school authorities should be to strengthen education, urge students to value and actively and automatically pay fees on time; at the same time, they must also understand the different reasons for the occurrence of arrears, so as to take various effective measures to urge students and their parents to pay off the arrears; for those who do have actual difficulties and are unable to make up the payment for the time being, they should be allowed to postpone or exempt the payment depending on the situation. It is very inappropriate to not allow students to take exams or even deprive them of the opportunity to continue their studies because they owe fees.

### 桐庐县初级中学不应该不让欠学费的学生参加考试

    桐庐县初级中学不应该不让欠学费的学生参加考试
    浙江森林工业局桐庐收购站戴毓楚、赵仕林、吴自强来信：桐庐县初级中学以不准学生参加考试的方法，向学生催逼欠费。事实经过是这样的：最近该校临近学期考试，有部分学生未将学杂费缴清或有部分尾欠。该校校长李康恺就向学生宣布：“如果本学期学杂费不交清，不准参加学期考试，也不准补考，以留级处理。”因此，这些因家庭经济困难而没缴清学杂费的学生都背上了思想包袱，温课期间整天跑到校外借钱。例如一个姓马的学生欠了部分学杂费，被迫赶到离桐庐八十里的分水县去借钱，来回花了四天时间。最后，他只差两万元钱没交，但学校事务主任还是不准他参加考试。这个同学没法，在考试前一天晚上十点钟跑到我们站里来借钱。当时我们钱不够，答应第二天一定给他送去。这位同学回校后向事务处请求第二天先让他参加考试，他保证当天付清学杂费；但仍得不到准许。结果逼得这同学在第二天上午五时赶到我站拿了钱去，学校才准他参加考试。七月六日该校已经开始考试了，但还有八个同学因此而不能参加考试。
    我们认为桐庐县初级中学这种做法是很不妥当的。这已严重地影响了学生的学习情绪和健康，造成了学校生活的混乱，给群众的印象也很坏。我们希望当地领导机关检查这个问题，并给被迫未参加考试的学生以补考机会。
    编者按：桐庐县初级中学以不准学生参加考试的方法逼缴欠费，这种作法很不妥当。严格遵守学校的规定和制度、按期缴纳各项费用，这是自费学生应该履行的义务；但就目前的实际情况来看，某些自费学生因一时经济困难或其它原因，欠费的现象在今天还是有的。学校当局为了解决这个问题，正确办法应该是加强教育，促使学生重视并积极自动按期缴费；同时，还必须了解发生欠费的不同原因，以便采取各种不同的有效办法督促学生及其家长缴清欠费；对于那些确有实际困难，一时无法补缴的，则应分别情况准予缓缴或免缴。如因学生欠费而不准参加考试，甚至剥夺了继续求学的机会，这是很不妥当的。
