(Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th) Nissan Auto workers, who have been engaged in a long-term struggle with capitalists for summer allowances, are continuing their struggle despite various threats from the management, such as factory closures, business suspensions, and layoffs.

Nissan Auto workers have been constantly fighting with the management since June of this year to demand summer allowances. However, the management has not only unreasonably rejected the workers' legitimate demands but also threatened the workers with police suppression and factory closures. On August 6, Nissan Auto closed its factories in Yokohama, Yoshiwara, and Tsurumi. On August 7 and 8, the management instructed the police to unreasonably arrest Tetsuo Masuda, chairman of the Yokohama factory union, and others. On August 21, it further suspended operations at eight factories and business offices in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and other places, and blocked all union members outside with barbed wire. Not only that, but the management also announced the dismissal of Tetsuo Masuda and others who had been arrested by the police.

Nissan Auto workers strongly counterattacked these offensive measures by the management. Three thousand workers took it upon themselves to remove the obstacles set up by the management outside the closed Yokohama factory to resist the factory closure measures. After the police arrested Tetsuo Masuda and others, the factories in Tokyo, Yokohama, Tsurumi, Yoshiwara, and Atsugi of Nissan Auto all held a 24-hour protest strike. From the 21st, the Nissan Auto union held mass meetings and decided to make demands to the management, including opposing factory closures, opposing business suspensions, opposing illegal suppression of the union, and ensuring the livelihood of union members during the dispute. The union also set a deadline for the management to respond to the union's proposal for collective bargaining by the 28th. Otherwise, the union will hold a general mobilization meeting at each factory on the 29th to determine the direction of continued struggle.

The long-term struggle of Nissan Auto workers has severely hit the management. According to Kyodo News, Nissan Auto's production in July was only one-third of the average monthly production, and there was no production at all in August. The management's income has thus decreased by tens of billions of yen.

Currently, the struggle of Nissan Auto workers is entering a tense stage. Backed by the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, an organization of Japanese monopoly capitalists, the management is preparing to continue resisting the workers' demands, attempting to force the workers to submit. However, the Nissan Auto workers, who are adhering to their heroic struggle, are receiving strong support from the Japanese working class. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has decided to allocate 100 million yen as a struggle fund for the Nissan Auto union.

(Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th) Following the Yoshida government's enactment of the "Anti-Strike Law," which first prohibited strikes by coal and electricity workers, Japanese coal industry monopoly capitalists have launched a large-scale offensive against coal miners, and mass layoffs under the guise of "enterprise rationalization" are intensifying. The Japanese working class is launching an active struggle to resist the brutal offensive of monopoly capital.

On the 24th, the Hokkaido coal mine management submitted a mass layoff plan to the union, deciding to lay off 12 percent of the 24,600 workers and 4,300 staff members, namely 3,000 workers and 548 staff members.

On the 25th, Mitsui Mining Co. officially notified the Mitsui Mining Workers' Union Federation that it would lay off 6,700 workers.

Japanese coal miners are strengthening their struggle against layoffs. The Mitsui Mining Workers' Union Federation convened a central struggle committee meeting on the night the management announced the layoffs, decided to launch a comprehensive struggle, and issued instructions to hold timed strikes and anti-layoff demonstrations.

Prior to this, the Kyushu Mitsubishi Mining Co. union held an extraordinary meeting on the 20th, resolutely demanding that the management withdraw the layoff plan and decided to hold partial strikes.

In addition, the Kyushu regional headquarters of the Japan Coal Miners' Union held its second extraordinary meeting in Fukuoka City from the 24th. The main issue discussed at the meeting was combining the struggle against "enterprise rationalization" with wage demands.

The 7,500 workers of Nissan Auto, one of Japan's largest automobile manufacturers, have been engaged in a struggle to demand summer allowances since June of this year and have held several partial strikes. They are still persisting in the struggle. On August 11, automobile workers in Kanagawa Prefecture held a "Rally of Workers of the All-Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union" at the Yokohama factory of Nissan Auto, deciding to unite and launch a struggle to support the struggle of the Nissan branch union. This is a corner of the venue.

    日产汽车公司工人不顾威胁继续进行斗争
    煤矿工人决定举行罢工反对资本家解雇工人
    【新华社二十七日讯】东京消息：为要求发给夏季津贴而对资本家进行了长期斗争的日产汽车公司的工人，正不顾资方的关厂、歇业和解雇等种种威胁，继续进行斗争。
    日产汽车公司的工人为了要求发给夏季津贴，从今年六月起一直在和资方进行着不断的斗争。但是资方不仅始终无理地拒绝了工人的正当要求，并且以警察镇压和关闭工厂等手段来威胁工人。八月六日，日产汽车公司关闭了它在横滨、吉原和鹤见的工厂。八月七、八两日，资方又指使警察无理地逮捕了该公司横滨工厂的工会主席益田哲夫等多人。八月二十一日，又进一步把该公司在东京、大阪和名古屋等地的八处工厂和营业部歇业，并用铁丝网封锁起来，把所有的工会会员都挡在门外。不仅如此，资方还宣布把被警察逮捕的益田哲夫等人解雇。
    日产汽车公司的工人对资方这些进攻手段进行了强烈的反击。三千个工人曾自己动手拆除了资方设在它关闭了的横滨工厂外面的障碍物，以对抗资方关闭工厂的措施。在警察逮捕了益田哲夫等人之后，日产汽车公司的东京、横滨、鹤见、吉原和厚木等地的工厂一齐举行了二十四小时的抗议罢工。从二十一日起，日产汽车公司的工会举行了群众大会，决定向资方提出反对关厂、反对歇业、反对非法镇压工会和保障工会会员在争议期间的生活等项要求。工会并限定资方在二十八日以前答复工会所提出的进行集体谈判的建议。否则，工会将在二十九日在各工厂召开总奋起大会，确定继续斗争的方针。
    日产汽车公司工人的长期斗争，已使资方受到沉重的打击。据共同社透露，日产汽车公司七月份的产量，只及每月平均产量的三分之一，八月份则完全没有生产。资方的收入因此减少了十数亿日元。
    目前，日产汽车公司工人的斗争正进入紧张阶段。资方以日本垄断资本家的组织日本经营者团体联盟为后盾，正准备继续抗拒工人的要求，企图迫使工人屈服。但是，坚持英勇斗争的日产汽车公司的工人，正受到日本工人阶级的大力支持，日本工会总评议会已决定拨出一亿日元作为日产汽车工会的斗争基金。
    【新华社二十七日讯】东京消息：紧接着吉田政府制订了首先禁止煤业和电气业工人的“禁止罢工法”之后，日本煤业垄断资本家已发动了对煤矿工人的大规模进攻，以所谓“企业合理化”为名的大批解雇正在变本加厉地进行。日本工人阶级正在展开积极的斗争来抗击垄断资本的残暴进攻。
    二十四日，北海道煤矿的资方向工会提出了一项大批解雇的方案，决定在二万四千六百名工人和四千三百名职员中解雇百分之十二，即工人三千人，职员五百四十八人。
    二十五日，三井矿山公司正式通知三井矿山工会联合会要解雇六千七百名工人。
    日本煤矿工人正在加强反对解雇的斗争。三井矿山工会联合会已在资方通知解雇的当天晚上召开了中央斗争委员会会议，决定展开全面的斗争，并发出了举行定时罢工和反对解雇的示威游行的指示。
    在此以前，九州的三菱矿业公司工会在二十日召开了一次临时大会，坚决要求资方撤回解雇的方案，并决定举行部分的罢工。
    又日本煤矿工会九州地方本部已于二十四日起在福冈市举行第二次临时大会。大会讨论的主要问题是将反对“企业合理化”的斗争和工资要求结合起来。（附图片）
    日本最大的汽车制造公司之一——日产汽车公司的七千五百名工人，从今年六月起，展开要求发给夏季津贴的斗争，并先后举行过几次部分的罢工。现在仍在坚持斗争中。八月十一日，神奈川县的汽车工人，在日产汽车制造公司横滨工厂中举行“全日本汽车产业工会工人奋起大会”，决定团结起来展开斗争，以支援日产分会工人的斗争。这是会场的一角。
