    Workers and Peasants Made Great Contributions to the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement
    Over the past three years, China's working class has demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, making significant contributions to the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.
    When the flames of aggression from American invaders reached the Yalu River, threatening our national security, many workers across the country were filled with righteous indignation and eagerly signed up to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In Dandong City, which suffered barbaric bombings by enemy aircraft, over five hundred young workers registered to join the army and over two hundred female workers volunteered to go to Korea for rescue work within days of the start of the Resist America, Aid Korea struggle. In Shanghai, more than five thousand young workers joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Many of these workers have distinguished themselves on the Korean front. Zheng Enxi, a sawmill worker from Yingkou City, bravely seized four enemy machine gun positions, captured four light and heavy machine guns, a rocket launcher, an automatic rifle, and a carbine during our army's night attack on Ersheng Mountain on the south bank of the Han River, becoming a special-class hero of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    Thousands upon thousands of volunteer railway workers, truck drivers, medical surgery teams, and epidemic prevention teams have established immortal achievements for the Chinese and Korean people in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Over the past three years, over 80% of all railway employees nationwide have volunteered to go to Korea. Within the Shanghai Railway Administration, 4,366 railway employees have continuously participated in transportation work on the Korean battlefield, and another 29,393 people have formed volunteer Resist America, Aid Korea reserve battalions. In the fierce struggle against enemy aircraft and naval artillery fire, the employees who went to Korea fully demonstrated the working class's heroic, intelligent, and self-sacrificing qualities. Li Guoheng, a Communist Party member who earned a first-class merit, once encountered an enemy air raid while driving a train loaded with tanks to the front line. He used various clever methods to confuse the enemy's targeting and bravely drove the train to its destination. The immortal hero railway worker Wang Jingzhou selflessly used his body to stop the wheels, rescuing six ammunition cars and a bridge. As of April of this year, among the employees who volunteered to participate in railway transportation work in Korea, 167 units have been awarded collective merits, and 5,621 people have emerged as people's heroes and model workers, of whom 2,742 have been awarded various medals and awards by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Together, Chinese volunteer railway employees and Korean railway employees have worked together to turn the transportation line on the Korean front into an unbreakable and indestructible steel line. In January and February of this year, although enemy aircraft conducted large-scale bombing and destruction of our railway lines, the transportation volume completed by our railway troops in January still reached two and a half times the highest monthly volume in the first half of last year. Even the enemy had to admit that our railway troops are the most resolute people in the world.
    China's working class has not only demonstrated heroism on the Korean front but also made tremendous achievements on the domestic production front. After the start of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, China's working class enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army," putting forward the battle cry of "the factory is the battlefield, the machine is the gun." In the summer of 1951, the patriotic production increase and economy campaign was first launched in Northeast China. By 1952, this movement had spread throughout the country. In this patriotic labor competition, the working class demonstrated a high degree of production enthusiasm and creativity. By increasing the quantity and quality of products, reducing costs, tapping industrial potential, and promoting advanced experiences, they increased production and saved a huge amount of wealth for the country. In the Northeast region, from the second half of 1951 to 1952, in a year and a half, the increase in production and savings for the country was equivalent to 27,377,338 tons of grain. In North China, East China, Northwest China and other places, the increase in production and savings for the country in 1952 alone amounted to more than 150,000 billion yuan. This greatly strengthened China's economic construction and national defense construction, and powerfully supported the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    On the basis of increased production and savings, workers across the country enthusiastically participated in the patriotic donation of weapons movement, donating 660 billion yuan with their labor, which could purchase 440 fighter planes, directly enhancing the strength of the Resist America, Aid Korea effort.
    Over the past three years, many factories and enterprises in China have also actively produced various supplies and necessities needed on the front lines for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Under the slogan of "Make whatever the front needs, give it whenever they need it," ordnance workers completed military production tasks promptly and adequately. In terms of food supply, China's working class came up with many methods suitable for the needs of the front, making a large number of delicious canned foods such as beef jerky, pork, egg powder, sausage, and biscuits. Over the years, food workers in Northeast China have supplied the Volunteer Army with hundreds of thousands of tons of various staple and non-staple foods. In the early days of the war, during the difficult times of eating fried noodles mixed with snow, the arrival of these canned foods on the front lines greatly encouraged the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army. For three years, clothing workers in various regions have worked day and night to support the Volunteer Army. The advanced experience of changing labor organization created by Jiang Wanshou, a clothing worker in Northeast China, has been promoted, and the efficiency of clothing production has increased by an average of 40 to 70 percent. On February 20th this year, Shanghai clothing workers completed all the summer clothing tasks. While it was still cold enough to wear cotton clothing in March, this batch of summer clothing was completely distributed to the Volunteer Army. This year, the summer uniforms sewn by a certain sewing factory in Wuhan for the Volunteer Army were particularly strong, comfortable, and beautiful. In order to ensure that the raincoats produced by workers at the Shanghai Huafeng Rubber Factory could be used by the Volunteer Army as raincoats when it rained, as tents at night, and as moisture barriers when laid on fortifications, they meticulously coated six layers of glue on two layers of cloth. In addition, Chinese workers also supplied the Volunteer Army with a large number of medical devices, medicines, and cultural and recreational supplies.
    Under the resounding slogan of "Contribute manpower if you have manpower, contribute money if you have money, contribute grain if you have grain," Chinese peasants have actively participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement for the past three years, making significant contributions.
    Peasants in various regions have enthusiastically joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement to fight against American invading bandits on the Korean front and to participate in the country's national defense construction. In Northeast China, at the forefront of national defense, the number of rural militia members who joined the Volunteer Army in 1951 accounted for 71% of the total number of people who joined the Volunteer Army in the region. In Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, more than 18,000 peasants requested to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The number of peasants who signed up to join the army often exceeded the quota by a large margin, demonstrating a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. In the conscription movement, touching stories of mothers sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and brothers vying to enlist were seen everywhere.
    Peasants in various regions actively carried out work to support the Resist America, Aid Korea front. Some voluntarily went to the Korean front, heroically engaging in various battlefield service work to ensure the victory of combat missions; others transported materials in the rear, ensuring supplies to the front lines. In the past three years, more than 600,000 peasants in Northeast China have participated in various logistics tasks such as Resist America, Aid Korea stretcher teams, transportation teams, and labor teams. Liu Qingshan, an elderly peasant from Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, not only allowed his three sons to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army but also joined the volunteer stretcher team himself. Around the New Year of 1951, the more than 3 million catties of pork and a large number of eggs sent to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front were mostly donated and supplied by peasants in Northeast China. Fishermen along the Yangtze River, Huai River, and Chaohu Lake in Anhui Province supplied more than 600,000 catties of dried fish to the Korean front in half a year. Rural women in Anhui Province sewed and sent more than 100,000 comfort bags to the front. More than 3,000 rural women in Xiang'er Township, Meishan County, Sichuan Province, launched a campaign of "one person, one shoe," making a large number of new shoes to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army.
    The broad masses of peasants throughout the country launched a patriotic production increase competition movement, which resulted in a year-by-year increase in the yield of grain and other crops, becoming one of the main material forces for resisting America and aiding Korea. In March 1951, the Li Shunda mutual aid team in Shanxi Province issued a letter challenging peasants in various regions to participate in a patriotic production increase competition. Peasants across the country responded enthusiastically, and in that year, more than 1 million mutual aid teams and many individual peasants participated in the patriotic production increase competition movement. In 1952, peasants in various regions, together with the people of the whole country, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army," and the patriotic production increase competition movement gained even greater development; more than 2.2 million agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations and many individual peasants participated in the competition in various regions. As a result of carrying out the agricultural patriotic production increase competition movement, China's total grain output in 1952 exceeded the highest pre-war annual output by 16.9%; the total cotton output exceeded the highest pre-war annual output by more than 50%; and the output of various other crops also exceeded the highest pre-war level. Among them, the rice output in Hunan Province in 1952 exceeded the highest pre-war annual rice output in the province by 33%. The rapid recovery and development of agricultural production nationwide provided a strong guarantee for the grain supply on the Korean front.
    The broad masses of peasants enthusiastically participated in the movement to donate weapons to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Peasants in various regions adopted methods such as striving to increase crop yields and developing sideline production to ensure the successful completion of the weapons donation plan, playing a significant role in helping the Chinese People's Volunteer Army strengthen its combat equipment. Of the 226 fighter planes donated by the people of Zhejiang Province, 43.6% were donated by peasants in the province. The fighter planes donated by peasants in Shandong Province accounted for more than 45% of the total number of donations in the province. The fighter planes donated by peasants in Hunan Province accounted for about half of the total number of donations in the province. Peasants in the suburbs of Beijing originally planned to donate two fighter planes, the "Beijing Peasant" and "Beijing Peasant Woman," but they over-fulfilled the donation by 1 billion yuan. Peasants in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, actively increased production, with cotton production in 1951 doubling that of 1950. Everyone launched a "one catty of cotton donation" movement, completing the payment for two "Cotton Farmer" fighter planes within two months. Peasants in Yuechi County, Sichuan Province, donated three fighter planes before National Day in 1951. Peasants in many other counties (cities) also independently donated "Peasant" fighter planes.
    Peasants across the country also actively participated in substitute farming work, ensuring that the land of revolutionary martyrs' families and military families was sown and harvested in a timely manner. Peasants in various regions have included doing a good job in substitute farming work in patriotic pacts and regularly conduct inspections through "Patriotic Days" or "Preferential Treatment Days." In order to ensure the grain yield of substitute farming fields, peasants in various regions have adopted methods such as fixed substitute farming, contracted farming with guaranteed output, and evaluation and competition to carry out substitute farming. In 1952, the average yield of substitute farming fields in various regions increased significantly compared to 1951; some regions even achieved bumper harvests. According to statistics from Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, and southern Jiangsu, the average yield of substitute farming fields in 1952 increased by 10% to 30% compared to 1951. Last year, substitute farming fields in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest, with an average actual grain yield of 264 catties per mu; among them, 549 mu achieved high yields, with an average actual grain yield of 556 catties per mu. With the increase in output, the living standards of revolutionary martyrs' families and military families have generally increased. (Xinhua News Agency)

    工人农民在抗美援朝运动中有巨大贡献
    三年来，我国工人阶级发挥高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，在抗美援朝运动中作出了巨大的贡献。
    当美国侵略者的战火燃烧到鸭绿江边威胁着我国的安全时，各地许多工人义愤填胸，纷纷报名参加了中国人民志愿军。遭受敌机野蛮轰炸的安东市，在抗美援朝斗争开始后的几天内，就有五百多个青年工人报名参军，二百多个女工志愿赴朝做救护工作。上海市参加中国人民志愿军的青年工人有五千多人。在参加志愿军的工人中，有不少人已在朝鲜前线立下功劳。营口市火锯工人郑恩喜，在我军夜袭汉江南岸二圣山战斗中，曾奋身夺取敌人的四个机枪阵地，缴获四挺轻重机枪、一门火箭炮、一支自动步枪和一支卡宾枪，成为中国人民志愿军某部的特等功臣。
    我国成千成万的志愿援朝的铁路员工、汽车司机、医疗手术队和防疫队，在抗美援朝运动中为中朝人民建立了不朽的功绩。三年来，我国报名志愿赴朝的铁路员工达到了铁路员工总数的百分之八十以上。在上海铁路管理局范围内，已经有四千三百六十六个铁路员工源源不绝地参加了朝鲜战地的运输工作，还有二万九千三百九十三人组织了志愿抗美援朝预备大队。赴朝员工们在和敌机、敌舰炮火的激烈斗争中，充分表现了工人阶级英勇机智和自我牺牲的崇高品质。荣立一等功的共产党员李国珩，有一次将装着许多坦克的列车驶向前线时，遇到敌机的袭击，他用各种巧妙的办法搅乱了敌机的目标，勇敢地将列车开到目的地。不朽的英雄铁路工人王景洲，不惜以自己的身体塞住车轮，抢救了六辆弹药车和桥梁。到今年四月为止，志愿赴朝参加铁道运输工作的员工中，已有一百六十七个单位立了集体功，涌现了五千六百二十一名人民功臣和工作模范，其中有二千七百四十二人分别获得了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府赠给的各级勋章和奖章。我国志愿援朝铁路员工和朝鲜铁路员工一起，共同努力，已把朝鲜前线的运输线变成炸不断、轰不毁的钢铁线。今年一、二月份，敌机虽然对我铁道线进行了大规模的轰炸破坏，但是我铁道部队一月份完成的运输量，仍达到了去年上半年最高月份的两倍半。就连敌人也不得不承认我们的铁道部队是世界上最坚决的人。
    我国工人阶级不但在朝鲜前线表现了英雄气概，而且在国内生产战线上作出了巨大的成绩。抗美援朝运动开始后，我国工人阶级即热烈响应毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，纷纷提出“工厂就是战场、机器就是枪炮”的战斗口号，一九五一年夏，在东北首先开展了爱国增产节约运动。到一九五二年，这个运动就普及到了全国。在这一爱国主义劳动竞赛中，工人阶级发挥了高度的生产积极性和创造性。他们以提高产品数量质量、降低成本、发挥工业潜在能力、推广先进经验等办法，为国家增产和节约了巨量的财富。东北区从一九五一年下半年开始到一九五二年的一年半时间内，就为国家增产节约了相当于二千七百三十七万七千三百三十八吨粮食的财富。华北、华东、西北等地在一九五二年一年内，也为国家增产节约了十五万多亿元的财富。这就大大地壮大了我国经济建设和国防建设的力量，有力地支持了中国人民志愿军。
    在增产节约基础上，全国工人热烈参加了爱国捐献武器运动，以自己的劳动捐献了六千六百亿元，可以购买四百四十架战斗机，直接增强了抗美援朝的力量。
    三年来，我国还有许多工厂企业的工人直接为中国人民志愿军积极生产各种前线需要的物资和生活用品。兵工工人在“前方要什么做什么，什么时候要什么时候给”的行动口号下，及时而充分地完成了军工生产的任务。在食品供应方面，我国工人阶级想出很多适合前方需要的办法，做成大量美味可口的牛肉干、猪肉、蛋粉、香肠、饼干等罐头食品。东北食品工人几年来供应给志愿军的各类主、副食品共达数十万吨。在战争初期的炒面拌雪为食的艰苦岁月里，这些罐头食品的到达前线，曾给志愿军指战员以很大的鼓舞。各地服装工人三年来始终日以继夜地为支援志愿军而劳动着。东北被服工人姜万寿创造的改变劳动组织的先进经验推广后，被服生产效率平均提高了百分之四十到七十。上海被服工人在今年二月二十日就完成了全部的夏衣任务。在三月里还穿棉衣的时候，这批夏衣就完全发到志愿军手里。武汉某缝纫工厂今年为志愿军缝制的单衣，特别结实、舒适、美观。上海华丰橡胶厂的工人为了使他们生产的雨衣可供志愿军下雨时当雨衣，夜里当帐篷，铺在工事上可以隔潮气，特别精细地在两层布上涂上六层胶。此外，我国工人还给志愿军供应了大量的医疗器械、药品和文化娱乐用品。
    在“有人出人，有钱出钱，有粮出粮”的响亮口号下，中国农民三年来积极参加抗美援朝运动，作了巨大的贡献。
    各地农民在抗美援朝运动中纷纷参加中国人民志愿军去朝鲜前线抗击美国侵略强盗，并参加祖国的国防建设。在国防前线的东北，全区农村民兵一九五一年参加志愿军的人数，占全区参加志愿军总人数的百分之七十一。湖南省湘潭县曾有一万八千多个农民要求参加中国人民志愿军。各地农民报名参军的人数常常超过名额很多，表现了高度的爱国主义和国际主义热情。在参军运动中，到处出现了母亲送儿子，妻子送丈夫，弟兄争着入伍的动人事迹。
    各地农民积极地进行了支援抗美援朝前线的工作。他们有的志愿地去到朝鲜前线，英勇地从事着各种战地勤务工作，保证战斗任务的胜利进行；有的在后方运输物资，保证对前线的供应。东北全区农民在近三年中，曾参加过抗美援朝担架队、运输队、民工队等各种后勤工作的共约有六十多万人。吉林省蛟河县有一个叫刘青山的老年农民，除了让三个儿子参加中国人民志愿军以外，他自己也参加了志愿担架队。一九五一年新年前后，东北区送到朝鲜前线慰问中国人民志愿军的三百多万斤猪肉和大量鸡蛋，大多是东北农民捐献和供应的。安徽省沿长江、淮河和巢湖等地的渔民，在半年中供应了朝鲜前线鱼干六十多万斤。安徽省农村妇女缝制送到前方的慰问袋共有十多万个。四川省眉山县象耳乡三千多农村妇女曾展开一人一鞋运动，赶做大量新鞋支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军。
    全国广大农民开展了爱国增产竞赛运动，使粮食和其他农作物的产量逐年增加，成为抗美援朝的主要物质力量之一。一九五一年三月间，山西省李顺达互助组向各地农民发出了爱国增产竞赛的挑战书，全国农民纷纷响应，这一年就有一百多万个互助组和许多个体农民参加了爱国增产竞赛运动。一九五二年，各地农民和全国人民一道热烈响应毛主席的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召，爱国增产竞赛运动有了更大的发展；各地参加竞赛的有二百二十多万个农业互助合作组织和许多个体农民。由于开展农业爱国增产竞赛运动的结果，我国粮食总产量在一九五二年已超过战前最高年产量百分之十六点九；棉花总产量超过战前最高年产量百分之五十以上；其他各种农作物的产量也都超过了战前的最高水平。其中，湖南省一九五二年稻谷产量超过了战前该省稻谷最高年产量百分之三十三。全国农业生产的迅速恢复和发展，对朝鲜前线的粮食供应提供了有力的保证。
    广大农民踊跃参加了捐献武器支援中国人民志愿军的运动。各地农民采用努力提高农作物产量和发展副业生产等增产办法，保证了捐献武器计划的胜利完成，在帮助中国人民志愿军加强作战装备上起了重大的作用。浙江省全省人民捐献的二百二十六架战斗机中，由该省农民捐献的占百分之四十三点六。山东省农民捐献的战斗机占全省捐献总数的百分之四十五强。湖南省农民捐献的战斗机约占全省捐献总数的一半。北京市郊区农民原计划捐献
    “北京农民号”和“北京农妇号”战斗机两架，结果又超额捐献了十亿元。四川省简阳县农民积极提高生产，一九五一年棉花较一九五零年增产一倍，大家发起一斤棉捐献运动，在两个月内就完成了两架“棉农号”战斗机的缴款。该省岳池县农民在一九五一年国庆节前捐献了三架战斗机。其他很多县
    （市）的农民，都单独捐献了“农民号”战斗机。
    全国农民还积极参加代耕工作，保证烈属和军属的土地及时播种和收获。各地农民纷纷把做好代耕工作列入爱国公约，并通过“爱国日”或“优抚日”经常进行检查。为了保证代耕田的粮食产量，各地农民采用了固定代耕、包耕包产以及评比、竞赛等办法来进行代耕。一九五二年各地代耕田的平均产量比一九五一年有显著增加；有些地区还获得了丰产。据山东、安徽、浙江和苏南等地区的材料统计，代耕田的产量一九五二年平均比一九五一年增加一成到三成。山西省武乡县的代耕田去年达到全面丰收，全县每亩代耕地平均实产粮食二百六十四斤；其中并有五百四十九亩获得高额丰产，平均每亩实产粮食五百五十六斤。随着产量的提高，烈属、军属的生活水平普遍上升。（新华社）
