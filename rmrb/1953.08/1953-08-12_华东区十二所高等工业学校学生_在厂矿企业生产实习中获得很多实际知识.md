Students from Twelve Higher Industrial Schools in East China
Gained a lot of practical knowledge during production internships in factories and mining enterprises.
More than 7,300 students from twelve higher industrial schools in East China studied from workers and technicians during their production internships in various factories and mining enterprises, gaining a lot of practical knowledge. Among them, all students from Zhejiang University, Shandong Institute of Technology, Qingdao Institute of Technology, and some students from Tongji University have completed their internships by the end of July. The remaining students from other schools will also complete their internships by the end of September.

The students, distributed in more than 80 factories, mines, and construction sites for internships, actively studied or participated in operations with workers under the guidance of instructors and technicians. They began to have a relatively comprehensive understanding of the complex production process of factories and mines, and also gained certain knowledge of various aspects of production. The students were extremely enthusiastic during their internships. Students interning at the Shanghai Electric Power Company's power plant carefully observed the structure of the boiler on the tenth floor, despite the high temperature of over 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Students from Zhejiang University interning at a power plant deeply observed the structure and function of the turbine and generator in the steam turbine area. Students from Qingdao Institute of Technology at the Foziling Reservoir construction site on the Huai River participated in each engineering team to observe the project; students from Tongji University interning in the field and at construction sites seriously discussed and studied with instruments and blueprints at the construction site. First-year students from the school's surveying department, under the guidance of teachers, were able to measure and draw relatively complex terrains. Their measurement accuracy greatly exceeded the requirements of the internship plan.

Through production internships, students greatly increased their love for their major. Many students at Tongji University previously had a simplistic view of their major. Students in the water supply and sewerage department believed that their future work was just burying water pipes and clearing sewers, so they were not focused enough in their studies. After this internship at major water companies in Shanghai, visiting the huge water supply and sewerage projects in the city, they realized concretely the complexity of water supply and sewerage engineering and the importance of water supply and sewerage projects in the life of urban people and in the construction of factories and mines. As a result, they felt particularly close to their major. Huang Xilu, a student in the water supply and sewerage specialty course, said: "I want to dedicate my entire life to the water supply and sewerage construction business of the motherland, and design the most modern water plants for many cities, factories, and mines in the motherland." Students from the school's highway department discovered during this internship that there are still many major problems waiting to be solved in the national highway construction industry. Many students expressed their willingness to dedicate themselves to the highway construction industry for life. Wang Qingchi, a student in the highway specialty course, said: "I grew up in the countryside, and I am willing to participate in the highway construction work in the vast rural areas for life to change the traffic conditions in the rural areas of the motherland." Students from Zhejiang University who interned at the power plant, after in-depth observation, further realized the importance of generators in the country's industrial production and strengthened their confidence in studying this major well. After these field observations and experiences, students realized the close connection between each course in the school and the country's construction, and many people expressed that they must study every course well after returning to school. A student from Tongji University who previously disliked electrical engineering said: "Before, I always thought that construction and machinery had nothing to do with each other, but now I realize that there are still many mechanical problems in construction projects. I must study electrical engineering well and truly become an expert in all aspects of this major." Many students deeply felt through this internship that the country needs construction talents in all aspects. Students in the materials inspection specialty course at Tongji University originally thought that materials inspection work was dispensable. They called themselves "custodial cadres" and mistakenly believed that doing materials inspection work was equivalent to storing warehouse materials. This time, during an internship at a large-scale lumber factory, they saw that many of the factory's equipment was mechanized, but because of the lack of inspection equipment, there were many waste phenomena in the use of materials. The urgent need of the production department for materials inspection personnel strongly encouraged their confidence in studying their major.

During this internship, students received great help from factories, mines, business departments, and workers. Each internship unit organized a production internship guidance committee or production internship guidance group to assist instructors in formulating internship plans in the workshop and at the construction site. At the beginning of the students' internship in the factory, the factory director or trade union chairman of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, China Textile Machinery Factory, etc., introduced the situation of the unit to them; each workshop and construction site assigned technicians to be responsible for guidance. The Shanghai Electric Power Administration Bureau of the Central People's Government Ministry of Fuel Industry organized security knowledge learning before students from Jiaotong University and Zhejiang University went to the factory. The director of the electrical field of a power plant also explained the problems of the power generation and transmission system to the students interning at the plant. Each internship unit also assisted students in solving the problem of food and accommodation during the internship. The East China Higher Education Bureau of the Central People's Government Ministry of Higher Education has twice sent working groups to understand the progress of students' production internships in key schools, and is now studying the problems in the internship process of students from Tongji University and Zhejiang University, so as to summarize experience to guide future students' production internship work.

    华东区十二所高等工业学校学生
    在厂矿企业生产实习中获得很多实际知识
    华东区十二所高等工业学校学生七千三百多人在各厂矿企业生产实习中向工人和技术人员学习，获得了很多实际知识。其中浙江大学、山东工学院、青岛工学院全部学生和同济大学部分学生的实习已在七月底结束，其余各校学生也将在九月底以前全部结束实习。
    分布在八十多个工厂、矿山、工地实习的学生们，在指导教师、技术人员的指导下，积极学习或和工人一起参加操作。他们对复杂的厂矿的生产过程，开始有了比较全面的认识，对生产的各个环节也获得了一定的知识。学生们在实习中情绪极为饱满。在上海电力公司发电厂实习的学生，不顾华氏一百二十度以上的高温，到十层高的锅炉上仔细观察它的结构。浙江大学在某发电厂实习的学生，在汽机场深入观察汽轮机和发电机的结构及其作用。在淮河佛子岭水库工地上的青岛工学院学生，参加到每个工程队中观察工程；在野外和建筑工地实习的同济大学学生带着仪器、蓝图在建筑工地认真讨论研究。该校测量系一年级学生在教师指导下，已能测量和画出比较复杂的地形。他们的测量精密度大大超过了实习计划的要求。
    学生们通过生产实习，大大提高了对他们所学的专业的热爱。同济大学许多学生过去对自己所学的专业曾存在简单化的看法。上下水道系学生认为他们未来的工作只是埋埋水管子、通通阴沟，因而在学习中不够安心。这次到上海各大自来水公司实习，参观了市区规模巨大的给水工程与下水道工程后，才具体地认识到上下水道工程的复杂性和给水和下水道工程在城市人民生活和工厂、矿山的建设中的重要意义，因而对他们所读的专业感到格外亲切了。上下水道专修科学生黄锡禄说：“我要把我的全部生命献给祖国的上下水道建筑事业，为祖国的许多城市、工厂和矿山，设计出最近代化的自来水厂。”该校公路系学生在这次实习中发现国家公路修建事业中还有许多重大问题等待解决。许多学生表示愿意终身献身于公路建设事业。公路专修科学生王清池说：“我是生长在农村的，我愿意终身参加广大农村的公路修建工作，去改变祖国农村的交通面貌。”浙江大学在发电厂实习的学生，经过深入观察，更进一步认识到发电机在国家工业生产中的重要地位，更加坚定了他们学好这方面专业的信心。学生们经过这些实地观察和体验，认识到学校的每一课程和国家的建设的密切联系，许多人表示回校后一定要学好每一门功课。同济大学一个过去不喜欢电工学的学生说：“以前，我总以为读建筑的和机械没有关系，现在才知道在建筑工程中仍有许多机械方面的问题。我一定要学好电工学，真正地成为本专业各方面的内行。”许多学生通过这次实习，都深深地感到国家需要着各方面的建设人材。同济大学材料检验专修科的学生，原来以为材料检验工作是可有可无的。他们把自己称为“保管干部”，错误地认为做材料检验工作等于保管仓库材料。这次在一家规模很大的木材厂实习，看到厂中许多设备都是机械化的，但因为缺乏检验设备，在材料的使用上，存在很多浪费现象。生产部门对材料检验人员的迫切需要有力地鼓舞了他们学习专业的信心。
    在这次实习中，学生们得到工厂、矿山、企业部门和工人的大力帮助。各实习单位都组织了生产实习指导委员会或生产实习指导小组，协助指导教师到车间、工地制订实习计划。在学生下厂实习初期，国营上海第二纺织机械厂、中国纺织机械厂等的厂长或工会主席为他们介绍了该单位的情况；各车间、工地都指派了技术人员负责指导工作。中央人民政府燃料工业部上海电业管理局在交通大学、浙江大学学生下厂前，都组织了保安常识学习。某发电厂电气场场长还为在该厂实习的学生讲解发电和输电系统的问题。各实习单位还协助学生解决实习中的食宿问题。中央人民政府高等教育部华东高等教育管理局曾两次派出工作组了解重点学校学生生产实习进行的情况，现在正研究同济大学和浙江大学学生实习过程中的问题，以便总结经验指导今后学生的生产实习工作。  （新华社）
