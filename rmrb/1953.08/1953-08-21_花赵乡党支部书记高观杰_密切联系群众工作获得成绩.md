    Gao Guanjie, Secretary of the Party Branch of Huazhao Township

    Achieves Success in Closely Connecting with the Masses

    Wang Hongduo of the Organization Department of the Yangxin County Committee of the Communist Party of China writes: Gao Guanjie, secretary of the Party branch of Huazhao Township, District Eight, Yangxin County, Shandong Province, implemented the working method of the mass line in his work, which made the work of the township proceed smoothly and was supported by the local people. The Yangxin County Committee has issued a circular to commend him.

    After the wheat harvest in 1952, there was a drought in the local area, and the district arranged for well-digging to combat the drought. However, at that time, the masses in the township had a more serious mentality of relying on the heavens. Gao Guanjie proposed a typical demonstration working method. After discussion at an enlarged meeting of the township party committee, it was decided to take Huazhao Village as the base village. At this time, Gao Guanjie explained the benefits of well-digging to all party members, members of the Communist Youth League, village cadres, and labor models, calling on them to vigorously carry out publicity work and take the lead in well-digging; on the other hand, he personally went to Huazhao Village with Xu Kuiwen, a comrade from the working group sent by the county, to publicize the benefits of well-digging to the masses, study well-digging methods, understand which households had well-digging conditions, and specifically help some farmers solve specific difficulties. In this way, Zhang Youbao, a party member in the village, took the lead in well-digging, and then the whole village dug six brick wells and two earth wells. After gaining well-digging experience in Huazhao Village, a meeting of farmer representatives was held throughout the township to promote it. Under the education of the facts, the representatives of the villages were willing to actively participate in well-digging work; after returning to the village, they took the lead in well-digging or publicized to the masses. As a result, the whole township dug 14 brick wells and 46 earth wells, which played a great role in combating and preventing drought.

    Last summer, aphids grew on the cotton in the township, green bagworms grew on the beans, and locusts were found in Cuijiawa Village. However, at that time, some of the masses believed that "insect plagues are natural disasters that cannot be cured," and some were worried that "pest control will cost money and delay work, and the result may be just a waste of effort and ruin the crops." Gao Guanjie decided to educate the masses with real people and real things. He took the village cadres and party members of Cuijiawa to the fields with pesticides to experiment with locust control, and the result was very effective. Then he organized the masses to visit and held a mass meeting to mobilize them. The farmers who had visited demanded locust control, and other masses also began to believe in the pest control method. Gao Guanjie specifically organized the broad masses to control pests in the fields, and after two and a half days, the locusts were eliminated. The green bagworms on the beans and the aphids on the cotton were also removed by mobilizing the masses in this way. The local people said happily:

    "If we don't actively control the insects, the crops will all be eaten."

    Gao Guanjie paid great attention to the masses' awareness and specific conditions in his work. Last year, when the patriotic health campaign was launched, the higher-level health department put forward the requirements of "five eliminations and eight cleanlinesses." He estimated that the masses could not do it at present, so he proposed according to the actual situation: each household should sweep the yard once a day; each household should dig a pit and pour urine into the pit instead of splashing it on the road. In this way, the sanitary conditions in the township were improved, and the masses also accumulated fertilizer.

    Gao Guanjie has a high prestige among the local farmers. The masses said: Secretary of the Party Branch Gao Guanjie does things really well. He discusses everything with us and does not put on bureaucratic airs. If you ask him to do something, even if he can't do it, he will explain the reason, which makes people feel happy.

    花赵乡党支部书记高观杰
    密切联系群众工作获得成绩
    中共阳信县委组织部王洪铎来信：山东省阳信县八区花赵乡党支部书记高观杰，在工作中贯彻群众路线的工作方法，使该乡工作顺利开展，受到当地群众的拥护。阳信县委已对他进行通报表扬。
    一九五二年麦收后，当地天旱不雨，区里就布置了打井抗旱。但当时该乡群众靠天思想比较严重。高观杰就提出典型示范的工作方法，经过乡支委扩大会议讨论后，决定以花赵村为基点村。这时，高观杰一面向全乡党、团员，村干部，劳动模范等讲明打井的好处，号召他们大力展开宣传工作并带头打井；一面又亲自和县里派来的工作组徐奎文同志一同深入到花赵村，向群众宣传打井的好处，研究打井办法，了解那些户有打井条件，并具体帮助某些农民解决具体困难。这样，该村党员张友宝首先带头打井，随后全村共打了六眼砖井、两眼土井。在花赵村获得打井经验后，全乡就召开农民代表会议进行推广。各村代表们在事实的教育下，都愿意积极参加打井工作；回村后纷纷带头打井或向群众进行宣传。结果全乡共打砖井十四眼，土井四十六眼；对抗旱防旱起了很大作用。
    去年夏天，该乡棉花上长了蚜虫，豆子上长了绿布袋虫，崔家洼村还发现了蝗虫。但当时群众有的认为“虫灾是天灾没法治”，有的顾虑“治虫要花钱、耽误工夫，结果恐怕只是白费劲，还糟蹋庄稼”。高观杰就决定用真人实事来教育群众。他带着崔家洼的村干部、党员等拿着农药到地里去试验治蝗，结果很有效。接着他就组织群众去参观，并召开了群众大会，进行动员。参观过的农民都要求治蝗，其他群众也开始相信治虫的办法。高观杰就具体组织广大群众到田间治虫，经过两天半的时间就把蝗虫消灭完了。豆上的绿布袋虫和棉花上的蚜虫也是这样发动群众治除的。当地群众都高兴地说：
    “要是不积极治虫子，庄稼全得被吃光。”
    高观杰在工作中十分注意群众觉悟和具体条件。去年开展爱国卫生运动时，上级卫生部门提出了“五灭八净”的要求。他估计到目前群众还做不到，就根据实际情况提出：每家每天打扫院子一次；每家挖个坑，把尿倒在坑里，不往道上泼。这样乡里卫生情况改善了，群众也积了肥。
    高观杰在当地农民中的威信很高。群众都说：支部书记高观杰办事真不差，有事都和我们商量着办，不摆官僚架子。找他办个啥事就是办不了也给讲个道理，使人心里痛快。
