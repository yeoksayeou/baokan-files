A Great Victory for the Peace and Democracy Camp
——"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" July 31st Editorial

After more than three years of bloody and destructive war and more than two years of negotiations, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27th, and military actions on the Korean Peninsula ceased. World opinion believes that the end of the Korean War is a great victory for the heroic Korean people and the brave Chinese People's Volunteers, and also a great victory for the peace and democracy camp.

In the hearts of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, in the hearts of working people in all countries, and in the hearts of all progressive humanity worldwide, the Korean armistice has aroused a sense of great satisfaction.

The lofty emotions of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, who are extremely pleased with the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are expressed in the telegram from G. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, to Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and in the telegram from V. Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, to Li Dong-geon, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and also in the telegrams from G. Malenkov and V. Molotov to Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China.

The working class, laboring peasants, and laboring intellectuals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, all patriotic forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, are now more closely united than ever around the Korean Workers' Party—the inspirer and organizer of the heroic resistance against American interventionists.

The Korean Workers' Party, tempered in fierce battles—the vanguard of the heroic Korean people—formed the United Democratic Fatherland Front of Korea and united all patriotic forces in the country to resist the aggressors.

The just nature of the patriotic and liberation war waged by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who assisted it, has stirred up mass heroism on the front lines and in the rear. All attempts by American interventionists to defeat and destroy the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have gone bankrupt in the face of the selfless perseverance and unprecedented courage of the people who have become masters of their own country and their own destiny. The ill-fated crusade of the aggressor gang could not advance past the 38th parallel, the same place from which they launched their aggression. The boast of the omnipotence of the American military machine has burst like a soap bubble.

The cessation of the Korean War is a great victory for the entire peace and democracy camp, and also a great victory for the world peace movement. The people of all countries have consistently insisted on ending the slaughter in Korea, withdrawing all foreign troops, and resolving the Korean dispute by peaceful means. The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and all countries in the democratic camp have repeatedly condemned American intervention and have steadfastly supported all peaceful measures aimed at ending the Korean War. As early as July 1950, the Soviet government forcefully demonstrated its peaceful policy and its efforts to quickly end the Korean War in its reply to Indian Prime Minister Nehru. The Soviet Union was the initiator of the Korean armistice negotiations that began in July 1951. Finally, on April 1st of this year, the Soviet government resolutely supported the proposal of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which aimed to break the deadlock created by the American side on the issue of prisoner of war exchange, thereby accelerating the peace negotiations and the signing of the armistice agreement.

The Soviet government faithfully implements its firm and unswerving policy of peace, and it declares to the world that no disputes and outstanding issues cannot be resolved peacefully on the basis of mutual agreement among the countries concerned. The Korean armistice convincingly proves that, in the current circumstances, the method of consultation is the only correct method for solving the most complex international problems. The "policy of strength" advocated by American imperialists has been countered by all progressive humanity. The cessation of military action in Korea is concrete proof that the principle of consultation has triumphed over the "policy of strength."

After the American aggressors gained painful experience from the failure of their military adventure, they were forced to agree to hold armistice negotiations under the pressure of world opinion and the growing contradictions within the imperialist camp.

The American rulers exhausted every possible means to delay the implementation of already agreed-upon decisions, in order to prolong the Korean War and extend the "wartime prosperity" of the American economy. They brought the South Korean puppet Syngman Rhee to the forefront. With American support and connivance, Syngman Rhee created brazen provocations, forcing a large number of prisoners of war who should have been handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to leave the prisoner of war camps. After this despicable action aimed at sabotaging the armistice negotiations was exposed, the Syngman Rhee gang clamored that it did not agree with the terms of the armistice and openly threatened to re-launch military action to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

In this situation, it is universally known that the responsibility for strictly abiding by the armistice agreement rests on the American government, on the American military command that controls the South Korean army and signed the agreement. Only when the Korean people have full opportunity to decide the fate of their country can stable and lasting peace be established in Korea. Unifying Korea on a peaceful and democratic basis and restoring the unity of the entire country is a matter for the Korean people themselves.

The people of all countries are deeply concerned that the armistice agreement can be strictly observed; they are vigilantly watching the plots and conspiracies of the enemies of peace. Defending and consolidating peace in the Far East and the world is in the vital interests of all humanity.

It is no secret that the end of the Korean War has aroused great dissatisfaction among the aggressive groups of the imperialist camp; cannon manufacturers—merchants of death—do not like the end of the war. The reaction of the American stock exchange to the signing of the armistice agreement was a sharp drop in stock prices. The American aggressive groups and reactionary newspapers are demanding that the government continue its frantic military production and continue to supply Western European countries with weapons and military materials. American Secretary of State Dulles, at the time of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, even declared that further efforts and sacrifices were needed, and that the United States would not reduce its armed forces in Korea. American diplomats are exerting greater pressure on their British, French, and West German vassal states, hurriedly organizing a "European Army" with the revived Hitler's "Defense Force" playing a major role.

The people who have won the victory of signing the Korean Armistice Agreement through selfless struggle must be most vigilant, preventing the aggressors' attempts to sabotage the armistice agreement and launch bloody wars again.

The Korean people are facing the task of restoring the unity of their homeland, rebuilding a peaceful life, and healing the serious wounds of war. The Soviet people, the working people of the people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia, and all progressive and peace-loving forces in the world, hope that the Korean people will victoriously complete these great and complex tasks, and express their readiness to give the Korean people all possible assistance.

The people of the democratic camp, the working people of capitalist countries, and all upright people in the world, welcome and congratulate the heroic Korean people and the great Chinese people for winning a great victory for justice and peace in the Far East and the world.

### 和平和民主阵营的巨大胜利——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”七月三十一日社论

    和平和民主阵营的巨大胜利
    ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”七月三十一日社论
    经过三年多血腥的和破坏性的战争以及两年多的谈判，朝鲜停战协定在七月二十七日签字了，朝鲜半岛上的军事行动停止了。世界舆论认为朝鲜战争的结束是英雄的朝鲜人民和勇敢的中国人民志愿军的伟大胜利，也是和平民主阵营的巨大胜利。
    在工人、农民和知识分子的心中，在各国劳动人民和全世界所有进步人类的心中，朝鲜停战引起了十分满意的情绪。
    苏联各族人民对于朝鲜停战协定的签字感到非常高兴的崇高感情，表现在苏联部长会议主席格·马林科夫同志致朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成同志的电文中，和苏联外交部部长维·莫洛托夫同志致朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省副相李东建同志的电文中，也表现在格·马林科夫同志和维·莫洛托夫同志致中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志和中华人民共和国政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来同志的电文中。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的工人阶级、劳动农民和劳动知识分子，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的所有爱国力量目前空前紧密地团结在朝鲜劳动党——对美国干涉者作英勇的抵抗的鼓舞者和组织者——的周围。
    在剧烈战斗中百炼成钢的朝鲜劳动党——英雄的朝鲜人民的先锋队——组成了朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线，并把全国所有的爱国力量团结在一起来抗击侵略者。
    朝鲜人民军和帮助它的中国人民志愿军所进行的爱国与解放的战争的正义性质，在前线和后方掀起了群众性的英雄主义。美国干涉者想打败和灭亡朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的一切企图，已经在成为自己国家和自己命运的主人的人民的忘我的坚毅和空前的勇敢面前破产了。侵略者匪帮的倒霉的十字军在他们发动侵略的老地方三八线上不能前进。美国军事机器万能的牛皮像肥皂泡一样被吹破了。
    朝鲜战争的停止是整个和平民主阵营的巨大胜利，也是世界和平运动的巨大胜利。各国人民一贯坚持要求终止朝鲜的屠杀，撤退一切外国军队并用和平方法解决朝鲜争端。苏联、中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以及民主阵营的所有国家，曾多次谴责美国的干涉行动并始终不渝地支持一切旨在结束朝鲜战争的和平的措施。远在一九五零年七月，苏联政府在致印度总理尼赫鲁的答复中就有力地表明了苏联的和平政策和它为迅速结束朝鲜战争所作的努力。苏联是一九五一年七月开始的朝鲜停战谈判的创议人。最后，在今年四月一日，苏联政府又坚决支持中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的建议，这个建议的目的是打开美方在交换战俘问题上所造成的僵局，从而加速了和平谈判并签订停战协定。
    苏联政府忠实执行它的坚定不移的和平政策，它向全世界宣布：没有任何争端和悬而未决的问题是不可以在有关各国互相协议的基础上用和平办法来解决的。朝鲜停战十分令人信服地证明了：在目前的情况下，协商的方法是解决最复杂的国际问题的唯一正确的方法。美帝国主义者所主张的“实力政策”遭到了一切进步人类的反击。朝鲜军事行动的停止是协商的主张战胜“实力政策”的具体证明。
    当美国侵略者从他们军事冒险的失败中得到了痛苦的经验后，他们迫于世界舆论的压力以及帝国主义阵营内部日益增长的矛盾，不得不同意举行停战谈判。
    美国统治者用尽一切可能的办法来拖延已经达成协议的决定的执行，以便拖延朝鲜战争和延长美国经济的“战时繁荣”。他们把南朝鲜的傀儡李承晚搬上前台。李承晚在美国的支持和纵容下，制造了厚颜无耻的挑衅事件，强迫大批应该交给中立国遣返委员会的战俘离开战俘营。在这个旨在破坏停战谈判的可耻的行动被揭穿后，李承晚匪帮就大声叫嚣它不同意停战的条款并公开扬言要重新发动攻击朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的军事行动。
    在这种情况下，大家都知道，严格遵守停战协定的责任就落在美国政府身上，落在控制南朝鲜军队和在协定上签字的美军司令部身上。只有在朝鲜人民有充分的机会来决定他们国家的命运的时候，才能在朝鲜建立稳定的和持久的和平。在和平民主的基础上统一朝鲜、恢复朝鲜全国的统一是朝鲜人民自己的事情。
    各国人民十分关心停战协定能够得到严格的遵守；他们警惕地注视着和平敌人的阴谋诡计。保卫与巩固远东和全世界的和平是符合全人类的切身利益的。
    朝鲜战争的结束引起帝国主义阵营侵略集团的极大不满已经不是一个秘密了，大炮制造商——死亡贩子——是不喜欢战争结束的。美国股票交易所对停战协定签字的反应是股票价格狂跌。美国侵略集团与反动报纸正要求政府继续进行疯狂的军事生产，继续以武器与军事物资供应西欧国家。美国国务卿杜勒斯在朝鲜停战协定签字的时候，竟然宣称还需要努力与牺牲，美国将不减少它在朝鲜的武装部队。美国的外交家们正向他们的英、法及西德附属国施展更大的压力，匆匆组织一支以复活了的希特勒的“国防军”担任主要角色的“欧洲军”。
    由于忘我的斗争而获得了朝鲜停战协定签字的胜利的人民必须具有最大的警惕，预防侵略者企图破坏停战协定并再次发动流血战争的阴谋。
    朝鲜人民正面临恢复祖国统一、重建和平生活与医治战争的严重创伤的任务。苏联人民、欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家的劳动人民以及全世界一切进步与爱好和平的力量，都希望朝鲜人民胜利地完成这些伟大而复杂的任务，并表示准备给予朝鲜人民一切可能的帮助。
    民主阵营的人民、资本主义国家的劳动人民以及全世界一切正直的人民，欢迎和祝贺英勇的朝鲜人民和伟大的中国人民为了远东和全世界的正义与和平而赢得的伟大胜利。（新华社布拉格三日电）
