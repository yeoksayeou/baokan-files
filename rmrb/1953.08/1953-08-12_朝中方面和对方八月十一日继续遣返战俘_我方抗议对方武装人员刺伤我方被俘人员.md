Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 11th: On August 11th, our side repatriated 149 non-Korean prisoners of war to the other side, and 250 Korean prisoners of war, for a total of 399 prisoners of war repatriated to the other side. Among the non-Korean prisoners of war were 100 Americans, 24 Britons, and 25 Turks.

On the 11th, the other side repatriated 2,153 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side (including 358 wounded and sick prisoners of war), and 600 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Following the incident on the 10th in which two of our captured personnel, Cui Qikui and another, were stabbed by American armed personnel, another of our captured personnel, Li Qiguan, was stabbed by armed personnel of the other side with a bayonet just before repatriation on the 11th. Colonel Wang Jian, our side's member of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee, lodged a serious protest with Mr. Beatouff, the other side's member, saying: "We absolutely cannot tolerate your barbaric acts of persecuting our captured personnel." Beatouff disclaimed responsibility, stating that they had consistently taken appropriate measures.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 10th: Today, as the American trucks carrying our captured personnel drove toward our handover area, crutches were seen protruding from the windows, each bearing the flags of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, made by our captured personnel at the risk of their lives. After arriving at our handover area, they untied the beloved flags and, with expressions of hatred, threw away the crutches given to them by the Americans, their faces covered in sweat and tears. They waved their self-made military caps and sang patriotic songs. Although the American escorts instructed the truck drivers to deliberately start the engines and make roaring noises, they still could not drown out these impassioned and stirring songs.

Among those returning today who were not listed as wounded or sick prisoners of war, there were five new casualties. Two of them were barbarically stabbed with bayonets by American personnel during the repatriation journey. One, named Cui Qikui, was stabbed through the left chest and has been sent to the hospital for treatment upon return. The other three were injured by stones thrown by American secret agents at 8:45 a.m. today while riding in vehicles from the other side's handover area toward our area.

Another noteworthy event today occurred at 1:00 p.m. A heavy rain fell, and our captured personnel returning in the other side's open-top trucks were soaked to the bone. At this moment, a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army named Liu Shengzhu suddenly jumped off a truck. He took out a three-foot-long, one-foot-wide blood letter made of joined shirts from his military cap. The upper part was inscribed with the American side's crimes of abuse and their firm determination to return to the motherland; the lower part was the names of 650 captured soldiers of the Korean People's Army written in blood. He requested that this blood letter be forwarded to the World Peace Council.

According to our captured personnel who returned today: The train transporting our captured personnel from Busan to Munsan has become a mobile hell of terror. They received no food or boiling water on the train, the windows and doors were tightly closed, and some of our captured personnel fainted from the heat. The returning captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers were subjected to even more brutal abuse during the sea journey from Jeju Island to Incheon. When they asked the American side for some fresh water to drink, the American side released two gas bombs, poisoning 27 people on the spot, causing them to bleed from their nostrils.

    朝中方面和对方八月十一日继续遣返战俘
    我方抗议对方武装人员刺伤我方被俘人员
   【新华社开城十一日电】八月十一日，我方遣返给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百四十九名，朝鲜籍战俘二百五十名，共计遣返给对方的战俘总数为三百九十九名。在非朝鲜籍战俘中包括美国籍一百名，英国籍二十四名，土耳其籍二十五名。
    对方在十一日遣返给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员二千一百五十三名（包括伤病战俘三百五十八名），中国人民志愿军被俘人员六百名。
    继十日崔奇傀等两名我方被俘人员被美方武装人员刺伤的事件之后，十一日竟又有一名我方被俘人员李其关，在临遣返前被对方武装人员用刺刀刺伤。战俘遣返委员会我方委员王健上校向对方委员毕陶夫提出严重抗议说：“你方这种迫害我方被俘人员的野蛮行为，是我们绝对不能容忍的”。毕陶夫竟推诿责任地表示他们已一贯采取了适当措施。
    【新华社开城十日电】今天载着我方被俘人员的美方卡车开向我方交接区时，只见从车窗里伸出了一根根的拐杖，上面系着我方被俘人员冒着生命危险而制成的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的国旗。到达我方交接区以后，他们解下敬爱的国旗，带着憎恨的表情将美方给他们的拐杖扔掉，脸上流着汗水和眼泪。他们挥舞着自制的军帽，高唱祖国歌曲。虽然美方遣送人员授意汽车司机故意发动马达，发出轰轰的声音，但仍然掩盖不住这激昂慷慨的歌声。
    今天归来的未被列为伤病战俘的人员中，有五个新的伤员。其中两个人是在遣返途中被美方人员野蛮地用刺刀刺伤的。一位名叫崔奇傀的左胸被刺穿，回来后已送入医院治疗。另外三个人是在今日上午八点四十五分乘车从对方交接区出发向我方地区开进时，被美方特务分子用石块击伤的。
    今日另一件引人注意的事发生在下午一时。天下了一阵大雨，乘着对方敞篷卡车归来的我方被俘人员全身都被雨水淋湿。这时，从卡车上突然跳下了一个名叫柳声卒的朝鲜人民军被俘人员。他从军帽里拿出一幅用衬衣连成的三尺长一尺宽的血书，上端写着美方虐待他们的罪行和他们坚决要求返回祖国的意志；下端是六百五十名朝鲜人民军被俘人员用鲜血写上的名字。他要求将这面血书转交给世界和平理事会。
    据今天归来的我方被俘人员谈：从釜山到汶山运送我方被俘人员的列车，已成了一座活动的恐怖地狱。在车上吃不到饭，喝不到开水，门窗紧闭，有些我方被俘人员被闷热得昏迷不醒。归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员在从济州岛到仁川的海上行程中，遭到了更加残暴的虐待。他们要求美方给一点淡水喝，美方却向他们施放了两颗毒气弹，当场有二十七人中毒，鼻孔流血。
