Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th—According to the Korean Armistice Agreement, the ten Neutral Nations Supervisory Teams responsible for supervising and inspecting the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of arms and ammunition entering and leaving Korea at specific rear area ports of both belligerent sides, after their advance personnel departed from Panmunjom on August 12, had successively arrived by August 18 at the ports of Sinanju, Sinuiju, Manpo, Hungnam, and Chongjin on the Korean-Chinese side, and the ports of Incheon, Daegu, Busan, Gangneung, and Gunsan on the United Nations Command side. On August 18, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission ordered the advance personnel of each neutral nation to immediately begin work. The remaining personnel from each of the neutral nations are scheduled to depart from Panmunjom on the 20th of this month, heading to the aforementioned ports.
Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th—On the 18th, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission issued instructions ordering the ten Neutral Nations Supervisory Teams dispatched to specific rear area ports on both sides to simultaneously commence work at 8:00 AM on the 19th.
However, only a dozen or so advance personnel from each Neutral Nations Supervisory Team have arrived at each rear area port. Therefore, the full deployment of each team's work must await the arrival of all personnel. Due to the US side harboring ulterior motives and repeatedly claiming that the rear area ports in South Korea are "not adequately prepared," the departure date for the remaining personnel of each team has been postponed from the 15th to the 20th, causing undue obstacles and delays to the deployment of each team's work.

    派赴双方口岸的中立国视察小组开始工作
    【新华社开城十八日电】根据朝鲜停战协定，负责在朝鲜敌对双方各后方特定口岸，监督与视察进出朝鲜的军事人员之轮换与武器弹药之替换的十个中立国视察小组，其先遣人员于八月十二日自板门店出发后，到八月十八日止，已陆续到达朝中方面的新安州、新义州、满浦、兴南、清津各口岸，与联合国军方面的仁川、大邱、釜山、江陵、群山各口岸。中立国监察委员会于八月十八日，下令各中立国人员的先遣人员迅即开始工作。各该中立国人员的后续其他人员，已确定于本月二十日离板门店，分往上述各口岸。
    【新华社开城十九日电】中立国监察委员会十八日发出指示，命令派赴双方特定后方口岸的十个中立国视察小组，在十九日上午八时起同时开始工作。
    但是，各中立国视察小组仅有先遣人员十余人到达各后方口岸，因此，各小组工作的充分展开，必须待全部人员到达后才有可能。由于美方怀有不可告人的目的，一再提出南朝鲜各后方口岸“准备不及”，因此，各小组后续人员的出发日期又从十五日推迟到二十日，使各小组工作的展开受到不应有的阻碍和拖延。
