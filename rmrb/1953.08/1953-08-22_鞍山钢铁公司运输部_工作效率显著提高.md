    Anshan Iron and Steel Company Transportation Department
    Work Efficiency Significantly Improved
    The volume of internal transportation and loading/unloading at Anshan Iron and Steel Company is extremely large. Every day, in addition to thousands of empty and loaded cars entering and exiting the factory from the railway bureau, there are also more than a thousand circulating cars within the factory. In the past, because the transportation work could not adapt to the needs of production plants and mines and capital construction, production was affected many times. After the implementation of planned management in various departments of Anshan Iron and Steel, the transportation and supply work must also be strengthened with planned management; otherwise, the realization of the work plans of various units will be affected.
    In implementing planned management, the Transportation Department, after a period of learning and exploration, determined that the central link was to focus on the work plan and dispatching. The transportation department's work plan must fully match the needs of each unit's production process and adapt to the equipment conditions of the relevant transportation and raw material storage sites. To this end, the Transportation Department organized more than ten technicians to investigate the company's sources and flows of goods in detail, and compiled a flow chart based on this. The Transportation Department also investigated the utilization of locomotives and vehicles at each station, and created a locomotive operation schedule, so that the staff at each station could have a clear understanding of the movement of each locomotive at all times. Based on these charts, the Transportation Department compiled a general "Internal Transportation Operation Instruction Chart." When preparing the work plan each month, the Transportation Department should conduct a comparison and inspection with the previous month's plan, visit key units for discussions, and convene transportation meetings of various factories and mines, changing the past chaotic situation of arguing and demanding more and giving less, so that the work plan gradually becomes accurate.
    Originally, there were many problems in the work of the Transportation Department's dispatching room. Most dispatchers lacked a strong sense of responsibility and were not familiar with production and transportation operations; the dispatching room's communication equipment was very poor, and it could not grasp the on-site situation in a timely manner. Therefore, in the past, the allocation of vehicles was not timely, and often could not meet on-site needs. This time, the Transportation Department, based on these weaknesses, conducted planned education for the dispatching staff, launched a competition between shifts, and improved the work enthusiasm and initiative of all dispatchers. At the same time, it increased dispatching telephone equipment, so that each dispatching station could directly connect with each station, each shunting area, and each loading and unloading site. At present, the dispatching room has been able to direct on-site operations according to the predetermined work plan, and is gradually becoming an organization with the ability to command, supervise, and implement the work plan.
    After the Transportation Department implemented planned management, the planning and management of internal transportation has begun to be strengthened. In the past, each station shouted every day that there were too few locomotives and not enough vehicles. After the implementation of the work plan, the number of locomotives was reduced by four, and ninety-four vehicles were sealed, while still ensuring the timely completion of tasks. The vehicle turnaround time has always failed to meet the national plan. Now, the turnaround time of the national plan has been completed, and it has been shortened by 0.06 days, which is equivalent to saving the nation's transportation capacity of more than 800 freight cars per month. The labor discipline of the Transportation Department employees was also very poor in the past. During the implementation of the work plan, the employees of each station were concentrated for training, labor discipline was rectified, and each station also formulated operating procedures. The sense of responsibility of the employees has been strengthened, and they can all conscientiously implement operating procedures. Accidents have been greatly reduced compared to the past.

    鞍山钢铁公司运输部
    工作效率显著提高
    鞍山钢铁公司厂内运输量和装卸量非常庞大，每天除铁路局进入和返出上千辆的空重车以外，厂内还有千辆以上的周转车。过去，因为运输工作不能适应生产厂矿和基本建设的需要，曾经多次使生产受到影响。在鞍钢各部门实行计划管理后，运输供应工作也必须加强计划管理，否则，各单位作业计划的实现就会受到影响。
    运输部在实现计划管理时，经过一段学习摸索，确定中心环节是抓住作业计划和调度工作。运输部门的作业计划必须完全吻合各单位生产过程的需要，并且适应有关运输和原材料贮备场所的设备条件。为此，运输部曾组织了十余名技术人员，详细查定全公司的货源货流情况，以此为根据编成货流图表。运输部还查定了各站机车、车辆运用情况，作出机车作业交路表，使各站的工作人员对于每台机车时刻的动向都能心里有数。根据这些图表，运输部编制出总的“厂内运输作业指示图表”。每月编制作业计划时，运输部要和上月计划进行对照检查，到重点单位进行拜访商讨，召开各厂矿运输会议，改变了过去争争吵吵多要少给的混乱情况，使作业计划渐趋准确。
    原来运输部的调度室工作中有很多问题。多数调度员工作责任心不强，不熟悉生产情况和运输作业情况；调度室的通讯联络设备很差，不能及时掌握现场情况，因而，过去的配车工作不及时，常常不能满足现场需要。这次运输部门根据这些弱点，有计划地对调度工作人员进行了教育，发动了班与班的竞赛，提高了全体调度人员的工作热情和积极性，同时增加了调度电话设备，使各调度台能和各个站各个调车区及各个装卸场所直接连络。目前调度室已能按预定的作业计划去指挥现场作业，逐步成为有指挥能力的监督和贯彻作业计划的机构。
    运输部实行了计划管理后，厂内运输的计划性和管理工作已开始加强。过去，各站天天喊机车少车辆不够用，实行作业计划以后，减少机车四台，封存了九十四辆车，还保证了按时完成任务。车辆周转时间过去一向达不到国家计划，现在已经完成了国家计划的周转时间，并缩短了零点零六天，等于每月给国家节省八百多辆货车的运输力量。运输部职工过去的劳动纪律也是很不好的，在实行作业计划时，集中了各站职工进行训练，整顿了劳动纪律，各站也制订了作业规程，职工们的责任心加强了，都能认真执行操作规程，事故已比过去大大减少。（沙友石）
