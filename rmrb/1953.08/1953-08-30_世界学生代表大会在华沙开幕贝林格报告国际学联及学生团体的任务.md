Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 29th (TASS dispatch): The Third World Student Congress opened on August 27th. At the afternoon session on the 27th, the following agenda was unanimously adopted:

    1.  Report of the Executive Committee of the International Union of Students (IUS), entitled "The Current Situation of Students in Various Countries and the Tasks of the IUS and National Student Organizations in the Struggle to Satisfy the Needs and Interests of Students."
    2.  Re-election of the IUS Council.

    After the agenda was adopted, IUS Secretary-General Bellinger delivered a report on behalf of the IUS Executive Committee.

    Bellinger welcomed representatives from many countries and nationalities. He particularly noted with satisfaction that representatives from the National Federation of Canadian University Students, the Student Federation of Chile, the National Union of Danish Students, and many other national student organizations that have not yet joined the IUS, as well as representatives from Nepal, Laos, Cambodia, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, and other countries participating in the IUS Congress for the first time, were attending the congress.

    Bellinger said that at this congress, feelings of friendship and efforts to strive for unity brought together representatives from as many as ninety-nine countries for the first time. He pointed out that the Third World Student Congress was being held in Warsaw, which embodies the terror of war and destruction, and also symbolizes reconstruction and confidence in a peaceful future. He suggested paying tribute to the victims of the war and swearing an oath to the people of the heroic Polish capital to fight with all their strength for peace, against war, and against the recurrence of the destruction suffered by Warsaw.

    Bellinger pointed out that easing international tensions and establishing international peace and cooperation are of vital concern to students. He then said that we are gathered here today to put forward demands for creating the necessary conditions for our lives and studies. These conditions will ensure that the earth's abundant resources are utilized, that human progress is guaranteed, that children are taught to respect humanity's lofty ideals, and that the well-being of all mankind is enhanced. These lofty goals have aroused unprecedented concern at this World Student Congress.

    Speaking on the issues of enjoying education, freedom of teaching, and the right to a guaranteed future, Bellinger said:

    In many countries, eight or nine out of ten people do not receive even the most basic cultural education. Higher education is usually the exclusive privilege of the wealthy. To give one or two examples, this is the case in France, where the children of workers account for only one percent of the students in normal schools; in Finland, the number of workers' children attending specialized schools decreased from 22,000 in 1939 to 11,000 in 1952.

    Bellinger emphasized that in capitalist countries, the living standards of students are also constantly declining.

    He said that students demand the right to enjoy education for all, regardless of their social status, political beliefs, religion, gender, or race. They demand that educational funds be allocated in such a way that the right to enjoy education is not merely nominal; that new schools, laboratories, and libraries can be built; that tuition fees be reduced or completely waived; that poor students can receive allowances sufficient to maintain their lives and pursue their studies; that students can receive free medical care, including physical examinations and vaccinations; that students can purchase textbooks and learning materials at low prices; that students can freely use libraries and laboratories; and that students can have opportunities to participate in sports and improve their cultural level.

    Bellinger said that, as Carl Megel, President of the American Federation of Teachers, said, the "loyalty investigations" and other investigations conducted by Senator McCarthy have made teachers afraid to express their opinions on social sciences. In this situation, where teachers who dare to stand up against such medieval methods are deprived of the opportunity to teach, what freedom and development of mankind can be spoken of!

    Look at the racial discrimination in South African and American universities, look at the book-burning movement led by Senator McCarthy!

    However, this approach is today being met with increasingly widespread and intense opposition from American students.

    Bellinger pointed out that in capitalist countries, students are in extremely miserable situations. After graduating from university, they cannot find jobs. For example, among the 100,000 students who graduated from universities and specialized schools in Japan in March of this year, 80 percent have not yet found jobs.

    In colonies, dependent countries, and backward countries, education is not given the slightest attention. Yet the population living in these areas accounts for almost half of the world's total population. For example, in the Belgian Congo, 97 percent of the population is illiterate, in Kenya 94 percent, and in Morocco 93 percent. All the students in these countries firmly believe that the fundamental reason for this situation is the colonial system and the suppression of these countries' national independence and sovereignty.

    Bellinger further pointed out that in the period since the last congress, students have seen more clearly than before how international tensions hinder normal contacts between students from various countries.

    Bellinger said that in the past three years, the IUS has contributed to the development of relations between students from various countries. At the initiative and with the help of the IUS, student delegations, groups, and individuals have visited almost all the major countries and some small countries. The Fourth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship recently held in Bucharest provided an example of how the IUS should tirelessly develop activities to strive for peace, friendship, and cultural exchange.

    Only in an atmosphere of world peace is it possible to meet the various demands of students, to defend cultural freedom, and to greatly develop cultural exchange.

    The arms race affects education funding. For example, the value of six B-36 bombers is enough to provide schooling for all students in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland.

    In preparing for this congress, the greatest efforts have been made to enable student organizations of various tendencies to send representatives to this hall so that the voices of students from all over the world can be heard and our problems can be solved. This congress represents the broadest range of opinions and is as broadly representative as possible. Organizations that are not members of the IUS are also participating in this congress.

    Bellinger said that it is now necessary to improve and expand the activities of the IUS, to fully cooperate with the efforts and aspirations of students of different tendencies, and at the same time promote closer and broader unity in the international student movement, including all types of students.

    Bellinger concluded by saying that today we are working for a more beautiful, happier, and more just future. We are preparing—as stipulated in our charter—to carry out the work facing us, the democratic citizens of the future. If we unite all our strength, if we understand each other and choose the same path, our ideal future is ours.

    Bellinger's report was repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause.

    世界学生代表大会在华沙开幕贝林格报告国际学联及学生团体的任务
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华沙二十九日电：第三届世界学生代表大会于八月二十七日开幕。在二十七日下午的会议上，一致通过了下列议程：
    一、国际学生联合会执行委员会的报告，题为“各国学生的目前情况和国际学联及各国学生团体在满足学生需要与利益的斗争中的任务”。
    二、改选国际学联理事会。
    在通过议程以后，国际学联总书记贝林格代表国际学联执行委员会作了报告。
    贝林格对来自许多国家和民族的代表表示欢迎。他特别满意地指出：出席这次代表大会的有加拿大全国学生联合会、智利学生联合会、丹麦全国学生联合会和其他许多尚未参加国际学联的全国性学生团体的代表，以及尼泊尔、寮国、高棉、萨尔瓦多、洪都拉斯、尼加拉瓜、巴拿马、莫三鼻给、葡属几内亚和其他一些第一次参加国际学联代表大会的国家的代表。
    贝林格说，在这次代表大会上，友谊的感情和争取团结的努力第一次把多至九十九个国家的代表团结在一起。他指出，第三届世界学生代表大会是在华沙举行的。华沙是战争和破坏的恐怖的体现，也是重新建设和对和平的将来的信心的象征。他建议向战争牺牲者致哀，并向英雄的波兰首都的人民宣誓，誓以全力为争取和平、反对战争、反对重演如华沙遭受过的破坏而斗争。
    贝林格指出，缓和国际紧张局势和建立国际和平与合作对学生是有切身关系的。他接着说，我们今天聚集在这里，是为了要提出为我们的生活与学习创造必要条件的要求。这些条件将保证地球上的丰富资源得以利用，保证人类进步，教养儿童尊重人类崇高的理想，并增进全体人类的幸福。这些崇高的目标在本届世界学生代表大会上引起了空前的关心。
    在谈到享受教育、自由教学和对未来有保证的权利问题时，贝林格说：
    在许多国家中，十个人中有八九个受不到最基本的文化教育。高等教育通常只是有钱人的专利品。举一两个例来说，法国的情况就是如此，那里的师范学院学生中，工人的子女只占百分之一；在芬兰，工人子女上专科学校的人数在一九三九年是二万二千，到一九五二年减至一万一千人。
    贝林格强调指出，在资本主义国家中，学生的生活水平也在不断下降。
    他说，学生们要求给一切人以享受教育的权利，不管其社会地位、政治信仰、宗教、性别与种族如何。他们要求：教育经费应像这样来分配，使享受教育的权利不是有名无实；使新的学校、实验室和图书馆可以修建起来；使学费减低或完全免缴；使贫苦学生能够得到足以维持生活和进修学业的津贴；使学生可以免费诊疗；包括体格检查和注射；使学生可以廉价购得教科书和学习用具；使学生可以自由使用图书馆和实验室；使学生得到参加运动和提高文化水平的机会。
    贝林格说，如美国教师联合会主席卡尔·米格尔所说，参议员麦卡锡所主持的“忠诚调查”和其他调查使教师们不敢在社会科学方面发表意见。在这种情况下，在敢于挺身出来反对这种中世纪办法的教师就被剥夺了教学机会的情况下，还谈得上什么人类的自由与发展呢！
    看看南非与美国大学中的种族歧视吧，看看参议员麦卡锡所主持的焚书运动吧！
    但是，这种办法今天已遭到美国学生越来越广泛的、越来越激烈的反对。
    贝林格指出，在资本主义国家中，学生处境极惨。在大学毕业后，他们找不到职业。譬如今年三月从日本各大学、各专科学校毕业的十万学生中，百分之八十迄今没有找到工作。
    在殖民地、附属国与落后国家中，教育没有受到丝毫的重视。而在这些地区居住的人口占世界总人口的差不多一半。譬如在比属刚果，人民有百分之九十七是文盲，在怯尼亚有百分之九十四，在摩洛哥有百分之九十三。这些国家所有的学生坚决相信，促成这种情况的基本原因是殖民制度，以及对这些国家的民族独立和主权的压制。
    贝林格进一步指出，在自上次代表大会以来的这个时期内，学生们已经比以前更加明白地看到：国际紧张局势是如何阻碍各国学生间的正常联系的。
    贝林格说，在过去三年中，国际学联对发展各国学生之间的关系作了贡献。在国际学联的倡议及帮助下，一些学生代表团、团体与个人访问了差不多所有的大国以及一些小国。最近在布加勒斯特举行的第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节，提供了一个榜样，说明国际学联应该如何孜孜不倦地来发展争取和平友谊与文化交流的活动。
    只有在世界和平的气氛中，才有可能满足学生的各种要求，才有可能保卫文化自由并大大发展文化交流。
    扩军备战影响了教育经费。譬如，六架B—三十六轰炸机的价值就足够供给丹麦、挪威、瑞典以及冰岛全部学生上学。
    在筹备这届大会的时候，曾尽了最大努力来使各种不同倾向的学生团体能派代表到这个大厅来以使各地学生的声音能被听到，我们的问题能得到解决。这届代表大会代表了最广泛的意见，而且尽可能地具有了最广泛的代表性。参加这次大会的也有不属于国际学联的组织。
    贝林格说，目前有必要改进并扩大国际学联的活动。使之与不同倾向的学生的努力与愿望完全配合，并同时促进包括各种类型的学生的国际学生运动更紧密、更广泛地团结起来。
    贝林格最后说，今天我们正为一个更美丽、更幸福、更公正的将来而工作。我们正准备——如我们的会章所规定的——来执行我们这些未来的民主公民所面对的工作。如果我们团结我们所有的力量，如果我们彼此了解并选择同一条道路，我们理想的将来就是我们的。
    贝林格的报告一再为暴风雨般的掌声所中断。
