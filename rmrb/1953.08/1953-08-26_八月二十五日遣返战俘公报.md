Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 25th: On the 25th, our side repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war and 250 Korean prisoners of war to the other side. Among the non-Korean prisoners of war were 136 American, 8 Canadian, 3 Australian, 2 Dutch, and 1 Greek. The total number of prisoners of war repatriated by our side to the other side was 400.

The other side repatriated 2,397 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side.

Today, when our returning personnel arrived at our exchange area singing patriotic songs, a U.S. interpreter kicked our returning personnel who were getting off the vehicle. This is the second brutal act by the other side in our exchange area harming our captured personnel. Our duty officer immediately protested to the other side.

Among our returning captured personnel today, two more were stabbed in the thigh with bayonets by U.S. soldiers in Incheon on the morning of the 24th.

    八月二十五日遣返战俘公报
    【新华社开城二十五日电】二十五日，我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百五十名，朝鲜籍战俘二百五十名。在非朝鲜籍战俘中包括美国籍一百三十六名、加拿大籍八名、澳大利亚籍三名、荷兰籍二名、希腊籍一名。我方遣送给对方的战俘总数是四百名。
    对方遣送给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员两千三百九十七名。
    今日我方归来人员到达我方交接区高唱爱国歌曲时，竟有美方通译员一名脚踢正在下车的我方归来人员。这是对方第二次在我方交换区伤害我方被俘人员的横暴行为。我方值班军官当即向对方提出抗议。
    今天归来的我方被俘人员中，又有两名于二十四日上午在仁川被美军用刺刀刺伤大腿。
