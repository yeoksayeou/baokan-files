    Prevent Human and Animal Casualties in Public Grain Storage Work

    The vast number of farmers in the Southwest, Central South, North China, and Northwest regions, where the summer grain requisition started earlier, have successively delivered public grain to state warehouses. Thanks to the strengthening of grain transportation organization by Party and government organs at all levels this year, and the ideological education on safe grain transportation and storage for district and township cadres and the masses of farmers, the number of human and animal casualties in grain transportation and storage work has decreased compared with previous years. However, in some areas, due to insufficient attention from Party and government leaders and lax organization and inspection, human and animal casualties still occur during grain delivery.

    According to some known accidents, most of them are due to negligence, and a few are accidental. The reasons for the accidents are mainly due to the following points: First, local cadres lack thorough inspections, so the phenomenon of the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled people and animals participating in the work has not been strictly prohibited. A grain delivery team leader in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, who originally suffered from heart weakness, fainted and fell heavily while leading the team in carrying grain to climb high and fill the warehouse, and died from his injuries. Wang Jitang, a farmer in Ting Sitou Village, Fourth District, Jize County, Hebei Province, was old, weak, and inconvenient to move. He was thrown down while driving a cart to transport grain, and his leg was crushed. The directly subordinate first public grain warehouse of Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, based only on the statistics of grain delivery personnel on the afternoon of July 5th, found that there were six people who should not have participated in the grain delivery. Secondly, some areas still lack thorough organization and command in grain delivery, and insufficient publicity, education, and ideological leadership have been done for the masses, failing to mobilize the masses to be cautious everywhere, and everyone to be careful to avoid human and animal casualties. During the summer grain requisition in Shaanxi Province, some district and village cadres only cared about urging grain delivery and did not do specific organizational work. They believed that organizing collective grain delivery and implementing the "delivery contract" was "wasteful of manpower and resources," so they did not strictly implement the "delivery contract." In some areas, although collective grain transportation was organized, due to lack of leadership, the order was very chaotic, resulting in crushing, bumping, and collision accidents from time to time.

    In addition, little attention was paid in advance to the allocation of human and animal vehicles, the inspection of vehicles, the arrangement of grain delivery time, the inspection of necessary roads and bridges, and the solutions to tea, food, accommodation, and medical care, which is also a cause of human and animal casualties. What is particularly serious is that some individual village cadres do not conscientiously implement policies and still have a serious style of coercion and command. For example, cadres in Nanhongde Village, Quyang County, Hebei Province, said: "Whoever's grain it is, they must deliver it, or it won't work," forcing two-thirds of the women and children in the village to participate in grain transportation; cadres in Dingwangzhuang Village, Suning County, said: "Whose family's cart is assigned, they must go, even if they die," as a result, an old man in his sixties had to deliver grain. This bad style violates policies and damages the government's prestige among the masses of farmers.

    Now, the summer grain requisition in various places is continuing to enter the warehouse, and the autumn grain requisition will soon begin. In order to eliminate human and animal casualties in the grain transportation and storage work, all localities should pay attention to grasping the following principles:

    First, strengthen organizational leadership and thoroughly implement the policy of safe grain transportation at all levels. Grain institutions at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels should take the initiative to contact relevant departments and establish necessary storage organizations (such as grain requisition committees, etc.) according to local conditions to uniformly lead the requisition and storage work. During the storage period, personnel should be dispatched to conduct in-depth inspections of the safety facilities in various places, identify problems, and solve them in a timely manner. The policy of safe storage should be vigorously implemented among requisition cadres, grain cadres, especially district and village cadres, and publicity and education on safe storage should also be carried out to the masses of farmers. Only when the vast number of grassroots cadres and farmers understand the policy of safe grain transportation and implement it in practical actions can human and animal casualties be eliminated.

    Second, strengthen the organization, discipline, and planning of the mass grain transportation work. All grain delivery personnel, animals, and vehicles should be organized into teams, led by township and village cadres. Vehicles and manual carrying should proceed in order, without rushing ahead. The speed should not be too fast, and there should be appropriate rest during the journey. The weight of loading and carrying must be appropriately limited. Before transportation, people, animals, and tools must be strictly inspected, and the elderly, weak, sick, and pregnant women and children are strictly prohibited from participating in transportation. Roads and bridges must be inspected and repaired in advance, and special personnel should be assigned to take care of dangerous roads, bridges, and ferries. Tea and water refreshment stations should be set up along the way. Human and animal doctors should be organized to be responsible for inspecting and treating the diseases and injuries of grain transportation personnel and animals. During the return journey of grain transportation, the original organization should be maintained, leadership should be strengthened, and any relaxation or麻痹 should be prevented.

    The grain receiving warehouse should sign a contract with the district and village to clearly stipulate grain quality standards, quantity, storage date, and the responsibilities of both parties. The storage time should not be too short, especially it should not be completed in a rush. Districts and villages with large tasks and a shortage of labor and vehicles can be stored in batches. After signing the contract, if there is a sudden change in the weather and grain cannot be delivered according to the stipulated date, the date can be negotiated with the grain depot. Mechanical execution should not be carried out to avoid accidents.

    Third, strengthen the safety facilities of grain receiving warehouses. Before storage, grain receiving warehouses should generally inspect the solidity of the warehouses, especially rented civilian houses and ancestral halls and temple warehouses that have been in disrepair for many years. Those that must be repaired should be repaired immediately, and those that are not strong should not be used reluctantly. In the southern high-rise warehouses, the amount of grain stored should be limited, and bulk storage warehouses with unstable foundations should have fences for storage. Ladders, springboards, etc. in the warehouse should be inspected and necessary equipment should be added. The warehouse should prepare food, drink, and rest places for the masses and prepare the necessary medical equipment.

### 杜绝公粮入仓工作中的人畜伤亡事故

    杜绝公粮入仓工作中的人畜伤亡事故
    今年夏征开始较早的西南区、中南区、华北区和西北区的广大农民，已陆续把公粮送入国家仓库。由于今年各级党政机关加强了运粮组织工作，对区乡干部和农民群众进行了关于安全运粮入库的思想教育，因而运粮入仓工作中人畜伤亡事故较往年有所减少。但也有部分地区，由于党政领导重视不够，组织检查不严，送粮中仍有人畜伤亡事故发生。
    据现已知道的一些事故，其中多数是责任事故，少数是意外的。发生事故的原因，主要是由于以下几点：首先是当地干部缺乏深入的检查，以致老的、弱的、病的、残的人和畜的出勤现象，仍然没有严格禁止。湖北孝感县一送粮组长原患心脏衰弱病，因带头背粮登高灌仓，晕跌重伤，不治身死。河北省鸡泽县四区亭寺头村，农民王计堂，年纪大身体弱，行动不便，在赶车运粮中被摔倒，把腿轧折。陕西省兴平县直属第一公粮仓库，只根据七月五日下午送粮人员的统计，不应该参加送粮的就有六人。其次，有些地区在送粮中仍缺乏周密的组织和指挥，对群众的宣传教育和思想领导做的不够，没有发动群众处处谨慎，人人小心，避免人畜伤亡。陕西省夏征中，某些地区的区村干部只管催粮，不做具体组织工作，他们认为组织集体缴粮和执行“交接合同”是“劳民伤财”，因此不严格执行“交接合同”。有些地区，虽然组织集体运粮，但因缺乏领导，秩序很乱，致轧伤、撞伤、碰伤的事故时有发生。
    此外，在运粮中由于事先对调配人畜车辆，检查车辆，安排送粮时间，检查必须检查的道路、桥梁，解决茶水、食宿及医疗等问题很少注意，也是造成人畜伤亡的一个原因。尤其严重的是：某些个别村庄的干部不认真贯彻政策，仍存在严重的强迫命令作风，譬如河北曲阳县南洪德村干部说：“谁的粮食谁送，不送不行”，逼得该村有三分之二妇女、小孩参加运粮；肃宁县定王庄村干部说：“派了谁家的车谁就得去，死了也得去”，结果六十多岁老头也得送粮。这种恶劣作风，违反了政策，损害了政府在农民群众中的威信。
    现在各地夏征公粮正在继续入仓中，而秋征公粮也快将开始，为了消灭运粮入仓工作中人畜伤亡事故，各地应注意掌握以下几个原则：
    第一、加强组织领导，层层贯彻安全运粮方针。省、专区、县各级粮食机构均应主动联系有关部门，根据当地情况，建立必要的入仓组织（如征粮委员会等），统一领导征收入仓工作。在入仓期间，应有重点地派员深入检查各地的安全设施情况，发现问题，及时解决。安全入仓的方针，一方面应在征收干部、粮食干部、尤其区村干部中大力贯彻，一方面还要向农民群众进行安全入仓的宣传教育。只有广大的基层干部和农民群众都了解了安全运粮的方针，并贯彻到实际行动中去，才能消灭人畜伤亡事故。
    第二、加强群众运粮工作的组织性、纪律性和计划性。所有送粮人、畜、车辆均应组织编队；由乡、村干部领队。车辆、人力挑运均须顺序行进，不得争先恐后，行路不得过速，途中要有适当的休息。装车和人挑重量，必须适当限制，运送以前，必须严格检查人、畜、工具，严禁老、弱、病人及孕妇小孩参加运输。道路、桥梁必须事先检查、修理，险路、桥梁、渡口应派专人照料。沿途设置茶水招待站。组织人、畜医生，负责检查和治疗运粮人畜的病伤。运粮回程中，亦应保持原来的组织，加强领导，防止任何松懈、麻痹。
    收粮仓库应与区村签订合同，明确规定粮质标准、数量、入仓日期、双方责任等。入仓时间不应过于短促，尤其不应以突击方式完成任务。任务大而缺少劳动力、车辆的区村，可以分批入库。签订合同后，如遇天气突变，不能按照规定日期送粮，可与粮库协商改期，不应机械执行，以免发生事故。
    第三、加强收粮仓库的安全设施。收粮仓库在入仓前应普遍检查仓房坚固情况，尤其是租借的民房和多年失修的祠堂庙宇仓房，必须修理的即修理，不牢固的不应勉强使用。南方的楼房仓库，存粮数量应有限制，墙基不坚固的散装仓房应有围囤储存。仓库内的楼梯、跳板等，应加以检查，并增添必要的设备。仓库应为群众准备饮食和休息处所，准备必要的医疗设备。
