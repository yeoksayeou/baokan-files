My Experience in Creating the Electric Shovel Combined Coal Loading Machine
    Ruan Mengwu, Engineer, Jiaozuo Mining Bureau

    In 1951, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine underwent a production reform, and output increased severalfold. However, the handling work had not changed from the backward method of manual basket carrying. Five hundred workers toiled all day, sweating and carrying, but still could not keep up with the production needs. The coal lifted from the mine piled up in the coal yard like a mountain, growing higher and higher, unable to be transported out. The workers felt very pained and offered many opinions. The leadership also felt the severity of this problem and wanted to solve it immediately.

    In June 1951, responding to the Party's call, I decided to create an electric shovel combined coal loading machine to replace manual handling and solve this serious problem.

    However, in the process of creation, I encountered fierce opposition from conservative ideas. Before liberation, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine was operated by imperialists. Therefore, some people believed that everything in the past was good, and if anyone wanted to change anything, everyone would oppose it. For example, in the summer of 1951, the Coal Mining General Bureau instructed us to resolutely abolish basket carrying in the mine, improve underground transport, and increase production efficiency. But at that time, it was met with opposition from many people. Even after we completed the reform, saving a large amount of manpower (saving more than 300 workers in Lifeng Mine alone), and greatly improving the overall production efficiency, some people still attacked this reform. This situation once caused me great concerns. Minister Chen Yu of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry came to the Jiaozuo Coal Mine at the end of 1951 and severely criticized this conservative thinking, encouraging everyone to improve their work. This rekindled my courage. In particular, I often saw in the newspapers the high patriotic spirit of the People's Volunteers in the Korean War and their heroic deeds of persisting in struggle under extremely difficult conditions, which moved me very much. At that time, Chairman Mao was calling on us to increase production and practice economy to support the People's Volunteers, and I felt even more that we should work hard in the rear to overcome difficulties and increase production to support the front lines.

    On December 14th, at the cadre meeting, I expressed my determination to the Minister to respond to Chairman Mao's great call with the practical action of creating an electric shovel combined coal loading machine. At that time, I received warm encouragement and support from the heads of the Ministry and the Bureau. Our experimental work started quickly. In the process of the work, some people did not believe that we could create successfully, some ridiculed us, some took a hands-off attitude, and some even used their authority to hinder my work. For example, when we were approved by the Bureau Director to send workers from the civil engineering team to Wangfeng Coal Mine to build a coal storage ditch for the electric shovel experiment, Xu Daosheng, the head of the ore dressing section of the mine, drove the workers back several times, not allowing the electric shovel to be tested within his jurisdiction.

    Despite the fierce opposition from conservative ideas, the Party and the higher authorities always gave me the greatest care and support. Before this year's "May 1st," after I reported to Minister Chen on the two-year creation process and usage of the electric shovel combined coal loading machine, he was very concerned. In May, Sun Ran, Director of the Coal Mining General Bureau, also came to the mine to understand the usage situation and sent two mechanical engineers, Chen Zhixian and Yang Gonglin, to the mine to specifically assist in the improvement and make a summary. Recently, the Coal Mining General Bureau has decided to focus on promoting the electric shovel combined coal loading machine in coal mines across the country. This news made us feel greatly gratified. All of our staff deeply felt the greatness of the Party and Chairman Mao. Without the wise support of the Party and leaders at all levels, this creation would never have been successful.

    The success of this creation is the victory of the combination of technicians and workers. In the process of work, I closely combined with workers such as Zhao Jinming, learning from each other, researching together, and receiving his great help. When the electric shovel started to be manufactured, I went to the repair shop every day to take a look. As time went on, I became familiar with the workers, and we talked more and more congenially, and our feelings gradually built up. One day, while marking the lines for cutting, Old Zhao thought that if a steel plate was added to the bottom of the electric shovel, not only could the strength be increased, but it could also be replaced and repaired at any time after it was worn out. He put this suggestion to me, and I quickly agreed with his opinion. After this, our cooperation became closer. When I started this complex work, I had a fierce struggle in my mind, worrying that if the experiment failed, wouldn't it cause a great waste to the country and make all the mine workers wait in vain? Sometimes I was so anxious that I couldn't eat or sleep. At that time, how much I hoped to have someone to help me technically! But it was difficult to find someone to discuss with at that time. Since Old Zhao enthusiastically helped me, it greatly increased my courage. After that, I brought up all the places where I felt inappropriate in the design in the past to Old Zhao and asked for his opinion. For example, the tail door of the loader was originally designed as a fixed type, which was simpler in structure, but very inconvenient to use. After discussing with Old Zhao and changing it to a flip door that could move up and down, it was not only strong and durable but also solved the difficulty in operation. In our joint research, sometimes I accepted Old Zhao's opinion, sometimes Old Zhao accepted my opinion, and sometimes a third, more complete opinion was generated based on mutual supplementation and mutual improvement. The comrades in the riveting team who participated in this work, under the influence of Old Zhao, also took the initiative to offer many opinions. For example, the welder Li Ronggui suggested that flat iron should be welded between a certain iron plate and the beam to increase the strength. Because there was no budget for materials for the temporary modification, he took the initiative to find it from the scrap pile to make up for it. Others such as the riveter Wang Dianru also provided many valuable opinions. Sometimes, when a part was made, it was tested and found to be unsuitable, and it needed to be modified or even reworked. The workers not only did not think it was troublesome but instead took the initiative to put forward suggestions. Whenever I went to the repair shop, everyone would gather around and enthusiastically discuss it. They treated the electric shovel as carefully and thoughtfully as a mother treats her daughter who is about to get married. They modified it again and again without getting tired of it, supplemented it again and again, and only then were willing to let her go out. After a period of trial use, many modifications and the final repair were made, and the electric shovel coal loading machine was finally officially put into use on "May 1st" last year.

    In the process of creating the electric shovel coal loading machine, Soviet expert Comrade Denisov gave me the most sincere care and help in technology and ideology, which gave me unlimited courage to complete this reform. When I first proposed the trial production of the electric shovel coal loading machine, Comrade Denisov attached great importance to it. He said: "At present, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine lacks machine coal loading, and workers are overloaded with manual basket pulling when loading cars, which has seriously affected the health of the workers. This is indeed a matter that needs to be solved urgently." He encouraged me to do this work well and put forward many valuable opinions. After the electric shovel combined coal loading machine was successfully tested, the expert specially studied my report in Beijing and found that my report neglected some necessary explanations and records. He asked the relevant comrades for inquiries. If there were calculation errors, they immediately pointed them out. For example, the problem of how to move the train carriages after the electric shovel had loaded the coal was not properly solved during the experiment. It was necessary to use manpower to push the cars and manually crank the winch. After the expert discovered this, he helped us to come up with a solution, giving full play to the effectiveness of the electric shovel combined coal loading machine. There are many such examples. Last October, Comrade Denisov met with me again, took out the drawings, and asked me in detail about its structure and usage, and answered many questions I raised. Some problems must be solved after first studying the theory. The expert patiently found many valuable technical materials for my reference and repeatedly told me that he would definitely help solve any difficulties. I said, "The electric shovel combined coal loading machine is now running very smoothly, but the only problem that has not been properly solved is the problem of shunting." The expert told me the solution he had already considered for us. He said that he had personally tried the slow-moving winch produced by a certain Chinese coal mine machinery manufacturing plant and told me the efficiency and usage methods, and he thought it was very suitable for the electric shovel to engage in shunting. Thanks to the expert's help, this problem that had not been solved for a long time has now been solved, which has created the necessary conditions for the next step of vigorously promoting the electric shovel combined coal loading machine.

    Thanks to the strong support of the Party, the electric shovel coal loading machine was finally successfully created. Through this work, I have made significant improvements in my thinking. In the future, I must strengthen my study of the Soviet Union, closely integrate with the workers, and strive for the country's large-scale economic construction. (Attached pictures)

    我创造电扒联合装煤机的经过                                                        
    焦作矿务局工程师  阮孟武
    一九五一年，焦作煤矿进行了生产改革，产量成倍的上升，但是由于搬运工作仍然没有改变以人力抬筐的落后方法，五百名工人整天汗流夹背的抬运，仍然赶不上生产的需要。从井下提升上来的煤，像山一样堆积在煤场里，愈堆愈高，运不出去。工人们感到非常痛苦，提出很多意见。领导方面也感到这一问题的严重，想要立即解决。
    我在一九五一年六月响应党的号召，决定创造一个电扒联合装煤机来代替人工运搬，解决这个严重问题。
    但是我在创造过程中却遭到了保守思想的猛烈反对。焦作煤矿解放前是帝国主义经营的，因此，有些人认为过去一切都是好的，假如有人想改动一下，大家就都反对。例如一九五一年夏天煤矿总局指示我们要坚决取消井下拉筐，改善井下运搬，提高生产效率。但当时却遭受到了许多人的反对，甚至在我们完成了改革，节省了大量人工（仅李封矿就节约三百余工人），并使全局生产效率大为提高后，还有人对这一改革加以攻击。这种情况，曾使我产生很大的顾虑。中央燃料工业部陈郁部长于一九五一年底到焦作煤矿严厉地批评了这种保守思想，鼓励大家改进工作。这才重新鼓舞了我的勇气。特别是我时常在报上看到人民志愿军在朝鲜作战时的高度爱国主义精神和在极端困难条件下坚持奋斗的英雄事迹，使我十分感动。那时，毛主席正号召我们增产节约以支持人民志愿军，我更感到我们应该努力在后方克服困难增加生产，支援前线。
    十二月十四日，我在干部大会上向部长表示决心，要以创造电扒联合装煤机的实际行动来响应毛主席的伟大号召，当时得到了部、局首长的热烈鼓励和支持。我们的试验工作很快地就开始了。在工作进行过程中，有人不相信我们能够创造成功，有人讥笑我们，有人采取袖手旁观的态度，甚至有人利用他的职权来阻碍我的工作。例如当我们经局长批准派土建队工人去王封煤矿修建供电扒试验用的储煤沟时，该矿选矿科长徐道生几次都把工人撵了回来，不让电扒在他管辖范围内试验。
    尽管保守思想激烈反对，党和上级却始终给我以最大的关心和支持，今年“五一”前，当我把二年来电扒联合装煤机的创造经过及使用情况对陈部长作了报告后，他就十分关心。五月间煤矿总局孙然局长也来矿了解使用情况，并派了机械工程师陈之铣、杨公麟二人来矿专责协助改进，并作出总结，最近煤矿总局已决定在全国煤矿中重点推广电扒联合装煤机。这一消息使我们感到莫大的欣慰，我们全体工作人员深深地感到党和毛主席的伟大，要不是党与各级首长的英明支持，这个创造是绝不能成功的。
    这一创造的成功是技术人员与工人相结合的胜利。我在工作过程中和工人赵金明等密切结合，互相学习，共同研究，得到他极大的帮助。当电扒开始制造时，我每天都去修理厂看看，日子一久，我和工人们也熟了，话也愈扯愈投机，彼此间的感情渐渐建立起来。一天，正在划线下料时，老赵想起，假如电扒下口再加一块钢板，不仅力量可以加强，磨坏后还可随时换下修理，他把这意见向我提了出来，我很快就同意了他的意见。这一次以后，我们的合作就更加密切了。当我在开始这个复杂的工作时，思想上曾一度有剧烈的斗争，担心假如试验失败，岂不造成国家很大的浪费，白白让全矿职工空盼一场？有时就急得连饭也吃不下，觉也睡不好，当时我是多么希望有一个人在技术上帮助我！但那时却很难找到一个可以商量的人。自从老赵热烈帮助我以后，大大增加了我的勇气，以后，我就把过去在设计上感到不合适的地方，全向老赵提出，征求他的意见。例如装车机尾部的翻门，原设计是固定式，构造虽较简单，但使用时有很大不便，经与老赵研究改为能上下活动的翻门后，不仅坚固耐用，亦解决了操作时的困难。我们在共同研究中，有时我接受了老赵的意见，有时老赵接受了我的意见，有时在互相补充互相提高的基础上产生了第三种比较更完整的意见。铆工班参加这一工作的同志们，在老赵的影响下，也都主动地提出许多意见，如电焊工李荣贵提出某处铁板与横梁间应加焊扁铁以增强力量，由于临时改要材料没有预算，他就主动到废料堆中找来补上。其他如铆工王殿儒等也提供了不少宝贵的意见。有时某一部分做好了，一试不合适，需要修改甚至返工时，工人不但不认为麻烦，反而主动地提出。每当我到修理厂时，大家就都围拢来热烈地研究讨论，他们对待电扒像母亲对待将出嫁的女儿一样的周到和细心。不嫌其烦地修改再修改，补充又补充，才肯让她出门。经过一个时期的试用，又作了许多次的修改和最后一次的修理，电扒装煤机终于在去年“五一”节正式开始使用了。
    在创制电扒装煤机的过程中，苏联专家捷尼索夫同志在技术上、思想上都给了我最诚恳的关切与帮助，使我获得无限勇气来完成这一改革。当我刚提出试制电扒装煤机时，捷尼索夫同志就很重视。他说：“目前焦作煤矿缺乏机器装煤，工人装车用人力拉筐过度疲劳，已严重的影响了工人身体健康，这确是迫切需要解决的一件事。”他鼓励我做好这一工作，并提了许多宝贵意见。电扒联合装煤机试验成功后，专家在北京曾专门研究了我的报告，发现我的报告忽视了一些必要的说明和记录，他就找有关同志提出询问，如有计算的错误，他们立即加以指出。又如电扒装完煤以后火车皮如何调动问题，在试验时也没有得到适当解决，不得已只有利用人力推车及手摇稳车，专家发觉后帮助我们想出了解决的办法，充分发挥了电扒联合装煤机的效能。这样的例子很多。去年十月，捷尼索夫同志又约我和他见面，翻出图来详细地询问我关于它的构造和使用的情况，并解答了我所提出的许多问题。有些问题必须首先学习理论后才能获得解决，专家又耐心地找到了许多宝贵的技术资料供我参考，并且再三地告诉我有什么困难他一定帮助解决。我说：“电扒联合装煤机现在使用已很顺利，但唯一没有得到适当解决的是调车问题”，专家就把他早已为我们考虑好的办法告诉了我。他说他曾去中国某煤矿机械制造厂亲自试用了该厂出品的慢动绞车，并把效率和使用办法告诉了我，他认为很适合电扒从事调车之用。由于专家的帮助，这个很久没有得到解决的问题现在算得到解决了，这就为下一步大力推广电扒联合装煤机创造了必要的条件。
    由于党的大力支持，电扒装煤机终于创造成功了。通过了这一工作，使我在思想上有了显著的提高。今后我一定要加强学习苏联、紧密与工人相结合，为祖国大规模经济建设而努力。（附图片）
