Jiangkou, Jianmen, and Xiaojian Townships in Jiange County, Sichuan Province, combined production with leading the masses to overcome natural disasters during the general election.

The general election work in Jiangkou, Jianmen, Xiaojian, Yandian, Yaojia, Baiya, Beimiao, and Hanyang Townships in Jiange County, Sichuan Province, began in early July. At that time, it was the busy farming season, and farmers generally worried that meetings would delay production. The general election work team also learned that these areas had many high mountains and few flatlands, and most of the land was dry land and slopes. Natural disasters such as droughts, floods, insect plagues, animal plagues, and wind disasters often occurred throughout the years, causing great damage to crops. Based on these circumstances, the general election work team started with leading the masses in production, enlightened the masses' democratic demands, and carried out the general election work. Activities related to the general election were carried out during farmers' spare time.

When the general election work in Xiaojian Township began, there were continuous heavy rains, causing waterlogging. The general election work team led the masses to fight against the waterlogging. For example, Wei Zhenglun, who worked in Yuanjia Village of the township, first actively mobilized and organized the masses to carry out flood and waterlogging prevention work through the village cadres. In addition to participating in flood and waterlogging prevention work, Wei Zhenglun also carried out general election propaganda work according to the original plan. Within five days, they used tree branches, rice straw, and mud to repair forty-four field ridges that had been washed away by the water, propped up fifty-two *mu* of the eighty-three *mu* of corn that had been washed down, covered with sand, or blown down by the wind, and added soil around the roots. They also repaired forty-three sections of river embankment that had been washed away by the water. These measures not only played a role in flood and waterlogging prevention, but also played a certain role in drought prevention. At the same time, the first stage of the general election work was completed. Many rice seedlings in the second village of Jiangkou Township were found to have rice stem borers, but this did not attract the attention of the village cadres. The general election work team sent cadres to the village to work with the village cadres to organize the masses to fight against the pests. After the farmers in the village realized the seriousness of the damage caused by rice stem borers and other pests to crops, and improved their enthusiasm for overcoming insect plagues, a climax of pest elimination was launched. In just half a day, seventeen farmers in four groups in the village pulled out more than 12,000 withered rice seedlings and caught more than 24,000 insects. The district leading cadres immediately promoted the village's experience to the entire district. It was discovered that wild boars and other wild animals were severely damaging crops in Qili Village, Jianmen Township. The general election work team and the village cadres summarized the existing experience of the farmers in the village in dealing with wild animals, and came up with some methods to overcome animal plagues. Eighteen farmers with original hunting experience formed three hunting teams to hunt wild animals in a planned manner without hindering production. In a short period of time, they hunted three wild boars, four wild chickens, eighty-three eagles, and five rabbits.

Under such circumstances, Jiangkou, Jianmen, and Xiaojian Townships in Jiange County smoothly completed the population survey and voter registration work for the general election by making use of the farmers' spare time, and moved on to the next stage of work. The local masses reflected: "The general election work team's method is very good. It not only did not affect production but also carried out the general election work, but also enabled us to overcome natural disasters. We must work harder in production in the future and elect good representatives." (He Qufei)

    四川剑阁县江口等乡
    在普选工作中领导群众战胜了自然灾害
    四川省剑阁县江口、剑门、小剑等乡，在进行普选工作中结合生产领导群众战胜了自然灾害。
    剑阁县江口、剑门、小剑、盐店、姚家、柏垭、北庙、汉阳等乡的普选工作，是七月初开始的。当时正是农忙时候，农民普遍有着怕开会多耽误生产的顾虑。普选工作组还了解到，这些地区高山多，平坝少，绝大部分是旱田、坡地，历年来旱灾、水灾、虫灾、兽灾、风灾等自然灾害经常发生，对农作物损害很大。普选工作组根据这些情况，从领导群众生产入手，启发群众的民主要求，开展了普选工作。有关普选的活动是利用农民空闲时间进行的。
    小剑乡普选工作开始时，连降大雨，造成涝灾，普选工作组便领导群众向涝灾斗争。如在该乡袁家村工作的魏正伦，首先便通过村干部积极发动和组织群众进行防洪防涝工作。魏正伦除了参加防洪防涝工作以外，同时也按原订计划进行普选宣传工作。五天内，他们把被水冲垮的四十四道田埂用树条、稻草、泥巴等糊起来，又把被水冲、沙漫、风吹倒了的包谷八十三?，用手理起来五十二?，并在根的四周加了土；还修复了被水冲垮的河埝四十三道。这些不仅对防洪防涝起了作用，对防旱也起了一定的作用。同时，也完成了普选第一阶段的工作。江口乡第二村很多秧田中发现钻心虫，但没有引起该村干部的重视，普选工作组便派了干部到该村和村干部一起组织群众向害虫进行斗争。该村农民在认识了钻心虫等害虫对农作物危害的严重性，提高了战胜虫灾的积极性后，掀起了除虫高潮。该村仅四个组的十七个农民，在半天内就扯了水稻枯心苗一万二千多根，捉虫二万四千多个。区领导干部立即把该村的经验向全区推广。剑门乡七里村发现有野猪等野兽吃农作物很厉害，普选工作组便和该村干部一起，总结了村中农民原有的对付野兽的经验，并想出了一些战胜兽灾的办法之后，由原有打猎经验的十八个农民组成三个打猎小组，在不妨碍生产的原则下，有计划地去打猎野兽。短期内他们便猎获了野猪三个、野鸡四只、老鹰八十三只、兔子五个。
    在这样的情况下，剑阁县江口、剑门、小剑等乡，利用农民空隙时间顺利地完成了普选的人口调查和选民登记工作，转入下一阶段的工作。当地群众反映：“普选工作组的办法很好，不仅没有影响生产搞了普选工作，还使我们战胜了自然灾害；我们今后要更加努力生产，选好代表。”    （贺去非）
