    The Struggle Against "Screening"
    ——A Record of the Heroic Struggle of Our Captured Personnel in Busan
    Luo Kunhe, Tan Jiaxun

    Returned personnel from the Busan prisoner-of-war camp narrated their heroic struggle against the illegal "screening" by the U.S. side in May 1952. They were massacred by the U.S. military as a result, with more than 200 people killed and wounded. The U.S. side originally declared the captured personnel from our side in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp as having undergone "screening" and "refusing repatriation." The heroic struggle of our captured personnel completely exposed the U.S. side's fraudulent "screening" and "refusal of repatriation."

    Returned personnel said that the prisoners of war detained in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp at that time were all sick and wounded personnel who had been captured. Many of them had been wounded on Geoje Island for refusing the U.S. side's forced detention. They waged a just struggle for more than a month to reject the U.S. side's "screening."

    On April 16th, the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp authorities announced the "screening" through loudspeakers and sent personnel from the U.S. military police headquarters' security section to conduct "individual conversations." The response of the captured personnel from Korea and China was: "We want to return to our motherland and don't need 'screening' at all!" The captured personnel of the Third Enclosure also raised self-made flags of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, expressing their firm will to return to their motherland.

    Two hours later, a U.S. Army captain led more than 40 U.S. military personnel, using armored vehicles equipped with heavy machine guns as cover, and rushed in with wooden sticks to seize the flags, killing a People's Army prisoner of war who was protecting the flag. Another Volunteer Army prisoner of war was wounded and died in the hospital.

    The next morning, the captured personnel from Korea and China held a memorial service with heavy hearts and anger, swearing before the spirits of the martyred comrades: "We vow to reject screening to the death!" Red flags dyed with the blood of the captured personnel from Korea and China were also raised on the tents of the first, second, and other enclosures.

    From May 11th, the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp authorities cut off the food supply to the first, second, and third enclosures. The tap water pipes in the third enclosure were also cut off, and of course, there was no medical treatment for the wounded and sick. The wounds of many seriously wounded people festered and became maggot-infested. The captured personnel were so hungry that they felt dizzy and weak, and would fall while walking. But their determination to demand repatriation did not waver in the slightest. Yang Changjun, a seriously wounded man who had lost his sight, was so weak from hunger that he could not move, but he still shouted in a hoarse voice: "Comrades, if I die, please take my name back to the motherland!"

    A few days later, the U.S. military authorities drove in several jeeps loaded with rice, pork, and canned food. They shamelessly went outside the barbed wire and said to the starving prisoners of war: "If you accept the screening, we will give you food!" The prisoners of war angrily rejected this temptation, saying: "We want to eat, but we don't eat this poison-like food!"

    During this period, the captured personnel from Korea and China in the first enclosure suffered the most torture because they were surrounded by the enemy on all sides. They ate grass, and roasted broken leather belts and leather shoes to eat. In the end, they had to reach their hands outside the barbed wire to pull up grass roots to eat. Returned personnel Hao Ansheng recalled: "Although the leather belt was so unpalatable, bitter, stinky, and astringent, in order to return to the motherland, we bit off a piece and swallowed it hard." By May 18th, when almost everyone was too weak to move from hunger, the Americans rushed in and asked them one by one: "Where are you going now?" Each of them still firmly replied: "Return to the motherland!"

    The second and third enclosures were adjacent to other enclosures, and the captured personnel from Korea and China there secretly bypassed the U.S. military's searchlights at night and crossed the barbed wire to send them their meager rations.

    Hunger and torture could not conquer the firm will of our sick and wounded captured personnel to demand repatriation, so the U.S. military authorities resorted to violence. At 5:00 a.m. on May 20th, a multi-battalion U.S. force, under the cover of tanks, suddenly rushed into the third enclosure of the Busan prisoner-of-war camp from the front and back gates. A U.S. Army colonel sat in a jeep and directed the massacre with a loudspeaker. In an instant, grenades, heavy machine guns, and 60mm mortars rang out, and the stench and thick smoke of poison gas shells permeated the entire camp, and the flames of incendiary bombs spread everywhere. The captured sick and wounded personnel from Korea and China, who had been starved for nine days, were forced to grab their crutches, tent poles, and stones for self-defense.

    More than an hour later, many of our captured personnel fell in pools of blood, and many prisoners of war who were originally disabled suffered additional injuries. But they shouted: "Do not accept screening!" "Resolutely return to the motherland!" Yang Changjun, who was blind, also lay on the bunk and shouted: "Oppose the U.S. military's massacre!"

    The U.S. side's various atrocities have not shaken our captured personnel's firm will to demand repatriation to the motherland in the slightest. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 反“甄别”的斗争——记釜山我方被俘人员的英勇斗争

    反“甄别”的斗争
    ——记釜山我方被俘人员的英勇斗争
    罗昆禾、谭家崐
    从釜山战俘营归来的我方被俘人员叙述了他们在一九五二年五月反对美方非法“甄别”的英勇斗争经过。他们曾因此遭到美军的屠杀，被打死、打伤达二百多人。美方原来把釜山战俘营中的我方被俘人员，宣布为经过“甄别”而“拒绝遣返”的。我方被俘人员的英勇斗争完全揭露了美方的所谓“甄别”和“拒绝遣返”的骗局。
    归来人员说，当时釜山战俘营中拘留的战俘都是病伤被俘人员，其中有许多人是在巨济岛因为拒绝美方强迫扣留而被打伤。他们为拒绝美方的“甄别”曾进行了一个多月的正义斗争。
    四月十六日，美方战俘营当局用广播器向战俘宣布要进行“甄别”，并派美军宪兵司令部警备科的人前来进行“个别谈话”。朝中被俘人员的回答是：“我们要回祖国，根本不需要‘甄别’！”第三收容所的被俘人员还升起了自制的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的国旗，表示自己坚决要求返回祖国的意志。
    两小时后，一个美军上尉带了四十多个美军人员以架着重机枪的装甲车为掩护，手执木棒冲进来夺旗，打死了一个护旗的人民军战俘，另一个志愿军战俘被打伤后在病院里死去。
    第二天早晨，朝中被俘人员抱着沉痛而愤怒的心情举行了追悼大会，在死难同志的灵前宣誓：“誓死拒绝甄别！”在第一、第二等收容所的帐篷上也升起了朝中被俘人员用自己的鲜血染成的红旗。
    五月十一日起，美方战俘营当局竟断绝供给第一、第二、第三收容所的粮食，第三收容所的自来水管也被截断，当然更谈不到伤病人员应该得到的医药治疗。许多重伤员的伤口都腐烂起来，生了蛆；被俘人员们都饿得心慌腿软，走路都会跌倒。但是他们坚决要求遣返的意志没有丝毫动摇。双目失明的重伤员杨昌俊已饿得不能动弹，还用喑哑的声音喊道：“同志们，我如果死了，请把我的名字带回祖国！”
    几天以后，美军当局开来几辆吉普车，上面装着大米饭、猪肉、罐头，他们无耻地到铁丝网外面向饥饿中的战俘说：“你们接受了甄别就给你们吃饭！”战俘们愤怒地拒绝了这种引诱，他们说：“我们要吃饭，可是我们不吃这种毒药一样的饭！”
    在这个期间，第一收容所的朝中被俘人员因为四面都被敌人围住，受到的折磨最大。他们吃草，把破皮带、皮鞋用火烤来吃，最后不得不把手伸到铁丝网外拔草根吃。归来人员郝安生回忆说：“皮带虽然那么难吃，又苦，又臭，又涩。但为了回祖国，用牙咬着撕下一块就硬往下咽。”到五月十八日，他们几乎每个人都饿得不能动弹的时候，美国人冲进来逐个问他们：“现在到那里去呀？”他们每个人仍坚决回答说：“回祖国！”
    第二、第三收容所的邻近还有别的收容所，那里的朝中被俘人员把自己原来就少得可怜的口粮，在夜里避开美军的探照灯光，越过铁丝网送来接济他们。
    饥饿和折磨不能征服坚决要求遣返的我方病伤被俘人员，美军当局于是拿出了暴力。五月二十日清晨五时，美军一个多营在坦克掩护下，突然从釜山战俘营第三收容所的前门和后门冲了进去。一个美军上校坐在吉普车上用喇叭筒指挥屠杀。一瞬眼间，手榴弹、重机枪、六零炮都响起来了，毒气弹的臭气和浓烟弥漫着整个营场，烧夷弹的火焰四处蔓延。被饿了整整九天的朝中伤病被俘人员被迫抓起自己的拐杖、帐篷杆子、石块来自卫。
    一个多钟头以后，许多我方被俘人员倒在血泊里了，许多原来是残废的战俘身上又增加了创伤。但他们高喊着：“不接受甄别！”“坚决回祖国！”那位双目失明的杨昌俊也躺在铺上喊：“反对美军大屠杀！”
    美方的种种暴行，丝毫也没有动摇我方被俘人员要求遣返祖国的坚决意志。（新华社）
