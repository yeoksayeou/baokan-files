Xinhua News Agency, London, August 2nd Dispatch: Dulles's preparation to go to Seoul to meet with Syngman Rhee, as well as his remarks at a press conference on July 28th, have caused unease in British public opinion.

The "Daily Mirror," commenting on Dulles's statement regarding the U.S. policy on the Korean issue, raised the question: "Is the U.S. policy really that unattractive? Or is this just another one of Dulles's rude and uncivil actions?" The "Times" correspondent in Washington wrote that Dulles's remarks at the press conference clearly confirmed "some signs emerging in Washington: the United States is prepared to go its own way in the negotiations, and its contact with the South Koreans is more important than contact with any other country that has sent troops to fight in Korea." The "Times" warned: "If, after ninety days, the political conference yields no results, and the United States and Syngman Rhee withdraw from the conference together, the United States will be isolated. ..." The "Observer's" commentary pointed out that because the United States intends to go its own way in the negotiations, all the peace efforts made by both the East and West sides so far may be seriously threatened.

The "Daily Herald" editorial believes that Dulles's remarks are a "perfect example" of a method that makes it impossible to seek lasting peace in the Far East. The newspaper demanded that the British government must strongly adhere to Britain's views.

Some British newspapers indicated that representatives of the British government also shared the shock caused in Britain by Dulles's remarks at the press conference. For example, the "Birmingham Post" wrote in an article entitled "British Suspicion of Dulles": "Salisbury's prudence and the reserve of official figures during the debate on foreign policy in the House of Lords cannot hide the fact that British officials have been deeply shocked by the nature of Dulles's remarks on future steps regarding the Korean issue." The foreign affairs commentator of the "Manchester Guardian" wrote that in London, everyone is studying Dulles's remarks at the press conference on July 28th with "considerable unease and extreme care." The "Daily Herald's" parliamentary correspondent said: "Ministers and members of both the upper and lower houses of Parliament have made it extremely clear to the Americans that we intend to participate in the formulation of basic Far Eastern policy, and at the same time, Britain is uneasy about the remarks made by Dulles this week." The "Daily Mail" editorial said that Attlee raised the question of Dulles's "very surprising statement," and he was right to do so. The newspaper pointed out that the British people will agree with Attlee's view: Dulles's remarks are dangerous and have caused alarm. The final situation of the Korean War does not give either side the right to force the other side to accept its own conditions. If the United States withdraws from the political conference on the Korean issue, "Britain does not necessarily have to follow it." The newspaper went on to say that, moreover, Britain "cannot agree to an indefinite embargo on China."

Xinhua News Agency, August 1st Dispatch: British and Dutch newspapers published commentaries on July 31st, criticizing Dulles's remarks at the press conference on July 28th.

Britain's "Daily Mirror" pointed out: "We have warned the United States that we are unwilling to be a tail; if the U.S. puppet Syngman Rhee undermines the armistice, Britain reserves its freedom of action." The "Daily Herald" condemned Dulles, saying: Dulles has set an example in how not to achieve lasting peace in the Far East. The "Daily Mail" said that the American diplomacy explained by Dulles is very different from British diplomacy, and the newspaper pointed out: "It will not be easy to persuade the British people that there is a need to resume the (Korean) war."

The Dutch "De Waarheid" pointed out: Dulles's remarks "do not help at all to increase optimism about peace in Korea." The newspaper said that, in fact, Dulles regards Korea as a military barrier for the United States as a condition for peace, so it is not difficult to predict that peace certainly cannot be achieved in this way. The newspaper said that Dulles is focused on "obtaining" and is never willing to "give." "He believes he must do this before the political conference begins, and this does not make things easier to resolve."

    英、荷报纸斥杜勒斯准备在谈判中一意孤行
    “每日邮报”等发表社论主张英国不能跟着美国走
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社伦敦一日讯：杜勒斯准备前往汉城与李承晚会谈以及他在七月二十八日的记者招待会上发表的谈话，引起了英国舆论的不安。
    “每日镜报”在评论杜勒斯所说的美国在朝鲜问题上的政策时提出问题说：“难道美国的政策真的是那么不漂亮吗？或者这只是杜勒斯的又一次粗蛮无礼的行动？”“泰晤士报”驻华盛顿记者写道：杜勒斯在记者招待会上的谈话显然证实了“一些在华盛顿出现的迹象：美国准备在谈判中一意孤行，与南朝鲜人的接触要比与其他任何曾派军队在朝鲜作战的国家的接触还要多。”“泰晤士报”警告说：“如果经过九十天后政治会议没有结果时美国和李承晚一起退出会议的话，美国就会陷于孤立。……”“观察家报”的评论指出，由于美国打算在谈判中一意孤行，迄今为止东西双方所做的全部和平努力，可能受到严重的威胁。
    “每日先驱报”的社论认为杜勒斯的谈话是使得人们不可能求得远东持久和平的方法的“绝妙的典型”。该报要求英国政府必须强有力地坚持英国的观点。
    一些英国报纸表示，英国政府的代表对杜勒斯在记者招待会上的谈话在英国引起的震惊也有同感，例如，“北明翰邮报”在题为“英国对杜勒斯的怀疑”一文中写道：“萨利斯柏利在上院外交政策问题讨论时的慎重和官方人士的矜持，都不能掩饰一个事实，即：英国的官员已为杜勒斯关于在朝鲜问题上今后步骤的谈话的性质所深深震惊了。”“曼彻斯特卫报”的外交评论员写道，在伦敦，大家带着“相当不安的态度极端仔细地在研究杜勒斯七月二十八日在记者招待会上的谈话”。“每日先驱报”驻议会记者说：“大臣们和上下两院的议员们已极端明显地使美国人了解：我们打算参加远东基本政策的制订，同时，英国对杜勒斯本周所发表的谈话感到不安。”“每日邮报”的社论说：艾德礼提出了关于杜勒斯的“非常令人惊奇的声明”的问题，他这样做是正确的。该报指出，英国人民将会同意艾德礼的看法：杜勒斯的谈话是危险的，并且引起了惊恐。朝鲜战争的最后的局势，并没有给双方的任何一方以强迫对方接受自己的条件的权利。如果美国退出关于朝鲜问题的政治会议，“英国并不是一定要跟着它走的”。该报接着说，此外，英国“不能同意无终止地对中国实行禁运”。
    【新华社一日讯】英国和荷兰报纸七月三十一日发表评论，斥责杜勒斯七月二十八日在记者招待会上的谈话。
    英国的“每日镜报”指出：“我们已警告美国，我们不肯作尾巴；如果美国的傀儡李承晚破坏停战，英国保持它的行动的自由。”“每日先驱报”谴责杜勒斯说：杜勒斯在如何不在远东达成持久和平方面已树立了一个榜样。“每日邮报”说：杜勒斯所说明的美国外交与英国的外交是很不相同的，该报指出：“要劝英国人相信有恢复（朝鲜）战争的必要，这不是容易的。”
    荷兰“口号报”指出：杜勒斯的谈话“对于增加关于朝鲜和平的乐观情绪一点不是有帮助的”。该报说，事实上，杜勒斯把朝鲜应当成为美国的军事屏障作为和平的一个条件，所以不难预料，这样是一定不能达成和平的。该报说，杜勒斯专注意于“取得”而绝不肯“给予”。“他认为他在政治会议开始以前必须这样做，而这并不使事情更容易解决。”
