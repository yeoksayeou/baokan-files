    National Flags Fluttering on Geoje and Jeju Islands
    -- An Account of the Heroic Struggle of Our Captured Personnel
    Xiang Ming Jiang Bo
    Every day, as the American trucks carrying prisoners of war slowly approached our handover zone with their headlights on, we could see, from hundreds of meters away, our captured personnel eagerly awaiting their return to the motherland, vigorously waving hundreds of large and small national flags of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. These national flags had accompanied them through long and dark days, tightly connecting them with their motherland. The national flag gave them hope and faith, encouraging them to fight bravely for their insistence on returning to their homeland.
    On April 8, 1952, in the 602 POW camp on Geoje Island, a huge five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China was raised. This large flag was about one and a half meters long and one meter wide, flying high in the air, about four zhang above the ground, rustling in the sea breeze. The raising of this red flag represented the unwavering determination of our captured personnel to resolutely demand their return to their homeland. On the hellish Geoje Island, it radiated infinite light and warmth, like the sun dispelling darkness. All our captured personnel on Geoje Island saw this red flag – a symbol of the motherland – and were so moved that they shed tears. Facing the national flag, which was also facing the land, people, and leader of the motherland, they swore: They must return to their motherland!
    Afterwards, the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the 602 POW camp raised the national flag every day in the solemn sound of the national anthem. The American invaders feared this red flag as they feared sunlight.
    At noon on June 2, taking advantage of the fact that our captured personnel were eating and had no defenses, the enemy suddenly dispatched a large number of American soldiers carrying various weapons and wearing gas masks, surrounding the POW camp tightly. About three companies of American troops, led by a tank, rushed through the barbed wire and snatched the national flag. This was the only flag that was taken away by the enemy by force.
    Our captured personnel protested to the Americans. Bonner, the American POW camp commander known for his brutality, had to promise our captured personnel that they would be allowed to fly the national flag during festivals.
    In fact, Bonner's words were just a deception. From then on, whenever a festival came, the POW camp would increase its "alert," and thirty heavy machine guns would be set up on the fifteen guard towers around it. However, this could not stop our captured personnel from raising the flag of their motherland.
    August 15, the anniversary of Korea's liberation, arrived. In the 8th POW camp on Jeju Island, which had been reorganized from the original 602 POW camp, the enemy was on high alert early in the morning, forbidding the raising of the flag. Our captured personnel flexibly changed the flag-raising time. At twelve o'clock noon, just as the enemy was gloating, thinking that our captured personnel would not dare to raise the flag, ten five-star red flags were raised at the same time, fluttering in the clear sky. The enemy panicked. An hour later, they sent tanks and American soldiers carrying guns, bayonets, and gas masks. However, by the time the enemy rushed through the barbed wire, our captured personnel had already safely hidden the national flags. The Americans glared, gesticulated, and roared: Hand over the flags within one minute, or we will use violence. A minute passed, and the enemy's intimidation had no effect. The American troops then threw gas bombs and sulfuric acid sprayers at the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in each tent, and the black and smelly smoke enveloped the entire POW camp, injuring many people.
    The enemy's brutal suppression could only increase the hatred of our captured personnel. They would never bow to the enemy and were prepared to show the enemy once again their unyielding will to love their motherland and oppose the American forced detention of prisoners of war on the occasion of the National Day of their motherland.
    On the eve of October 1st, the captured personnel in the ten barracks of the 8th POW camp secretly dug flag pole pits three feet deep with excited hearts, made ropes for raising the flag, and connected the water pipes and tent poles they had found in advance into flag poles four zhang high. They also left each other's family contact addresses, determined to dedicate their lives to protecting the national flag of their motherland.
    On October 1st, our captured personnel got up before dawn. Everyone knew that this day was the happiest day for the people of the motherland, and Chairman Mao would inspect the parade on Tiananmen Square. However, on this day, those who were imprisoned in the enemy's POW camp and lost their freedom felt even more grief and missed their motherland even more, and no one could eat. At seven o'clock, each barrack held a short ceremony. They played the national anthem and blew the flag-raising bugle with various instruments they had made themselves. Then, ten bright red flags – the symbols of the motherland – were raised at the same time, flying high in the sky against the sea breeze.
    The enemy immediately sent more than ten tanks and a battalion of troops wearing gas masks, as well as ambulances and American soldiers wearing headphones and carrying walkie-talkies. Gas bombs, hand grenades, bayonets, carbines, and automatic rifles were all brought. The loudspeakers installed by the enemy in each barrack kept shouting: "Lower the flag! Lower the flag! Lower the flag!" But the captured personnel had only one thought: the longer it hangs, the longer the victory. The enemy waited for a while, and seeing that the red flag was still flying high, they began to charge towards the 7th barrack with a company of troops. Leading the way was Captain Brooks, who directly managed the 8th POW camp. Our captured personnel called him "Dog Captain." This captain, with a face full of arrogance and a bulging belly, had a small pistol slung across his chest. He called out the representatives of the captured personnel, but no one paid attention to him. He was so angry that his face turned green. While pulling out his pistol, he said in Chinese: "You don't say anything? You don't come out? I'll kill you!" Everyone still ignored him. He then asked: "Are you not afraid of death?" At this time, our captured personnel roared together in extremely loud voices: "We are not afraid of death! We have had enough of your half bowl of rice! We have had enough of living in your hands!" The muscles on the Dog Captain's face twitched, and he nodded with a cold smile, walking towards the guardhouse at the barbed wire gate to make a phone call. Soon, a bloody massacre began. The enemy concentrated their fire on our captured personnel with various weapons, and charged our captured personnel four times, with many of our captured personnel falling in pools of blood. The enemy, like a pack of greedy beasts, rushed through the barbed wire, straight for the flagpole. At this time, some of our captured personnel were stopping the enemy from advancing. Two people were shot dead by the enemy's bullets near the flagpole. Two others, braving the enemy's intensive fire, quickly lowered the national flag and burned it to ashes with gasoline and scrap paper that had been prepared in advance. They would rather die than let the national flag fall into the hands of the enemy.
    After the national flag of the 7th barrack was lowered, the national flags of the other nine barracks followed suit. The captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the 8th POW camp celebrated their festival by flying the flag for an hour and a half on the National Day of the New China. On this day, due to the brutal suppression by the Americans of their patriotic actions, 56 martyrs, including Gao Yong, Ma Rulong, Ma Heqing, and Deng Hongbin, were killed, and another 109 people were injured.
    On October 2nd, all the captured personnel in the entire POW camp put on white clothes and white flowers. Each barrack also set up mourning sheds and erected spirit tablets for the martyred heroes. Next to the spirit tablets was written: "Our martyrs were killed by American imperialism, and this is how it treats us in accordance with the Geneva Convention!" On October 7th, each barrack held a grand memorial service, making a total of more than 200 wreaths. After the meeting, everyone carried the spirit tablets of the martyrs and paraded three times inside the barbed wire to protest to the American army.
    To commemorate the martyrs who died in this flag-protecting struggle, the captured personnel of the 8th POW camp composed a "October Red Flag Song": "The red flag of October 1st, flying high in the sky, our blood has written down the bloody crimes of the American imperialism. The more brutal the enemy, the stronger we are. Fists are used as bayonets, stones resist machine guns; arms are close to arms, chests build iron walls. Defend our national flag, fight the enemy's madness. Hatred forms strength, blood debts must be repaid with blood. The wicked American imperialism cannot escape the hands of the people of the world. The red flag of October 1st, flying high in the sky, the heroic martyrs will forever live in our hearts."
    The captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who returned this time, filled with old and new hatred, sang this song with great enthusiasm and waved hundreds of bright national flags, returning to the embrace of their motherland.

    国旗飘扬在巨济岛和济州岛上
    ——我方被俘人员英勇斗争纪事
    向明  江波
    每天，当美方载运战俘的卡车开着大灯，徐徐向我方交接区开来的时候，我们远在数百公尺以外，就可以看见那些殷切盼望回到祖国的我方被俘人员，手里用力挥动着成百面大大小小的中华人民共和国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗。这些国旗曾经伴随着他们度过了漫长而黑暗的日子，把他们紧紧地和祖国联系在一起。国旗给予他们希望和信念，鼓舞着他们为坚持返回祖国而英勇斗争。
    一九五二年四月八日，在巨济岛六零二战俘营内，升起了一面巨幅的中华人民共和国的五星红旗。这面大旗长约一公尺半，宽约一公尺，高高地飘扬在离地面四丈高的空中，被海风吹得飒飒作响。这面红旗的升起，代表着我方被俘人员坚决要求回返祖国的不可动摇的决心。在地狱般的巨济岛上，它像驱逐黑暗的太阳一样，放射出无限光辉和温暖。整个巨济岛上的我方被俘人员都看到了这面红旗——祖国的象征，激动得流下了眼泪。面对着国旗，也是面对着祖国的土地、人民和领袖，他们宣誓：一定要回祖国！
    以后，六零二战俘营的中国人民志愿军被俘人员每天都在庄严的国歌声中将国旗升起。美国侵略者像害怕阳光一样地害怕这面红旗。
    六月二日中午，敌人趁我方被俘人员吃饭时没有防备，突然调来了大批携带各种武器的、戴着防毒面具的美国兵，将战俘营密密层层地包围起来。美军约三个连的兵力由一辆坦克领先，随即冲进铁丝网把国旗抢走了。这是一面唯一的被敌人仗着武力抢去的旗子。
    我方被俘人员向美方提出抗议。以残暴闻名的美方战俘营长官波纳不得不答应我方被俘人员在节日时准许悬挂国旗。
    事实上，波纳的话只是欺骗。从此以后，凡是节日来到时，战俘营就增加“戒备”，在周围的十五个岗楼上就架起了三十挺重机枪。但是，这也不能阻止我方被俘人员升起祖国的旗帜。
    八月十五日，朝鲜解放纪念日来了。在由原来六零二战俘营改编的济州岛第八战俘营里，敌人一早就戒备森严，不准升旗。我方被俘人员灵活地改变了升旗时间。正午十二点钟，当敌人正得意洋洋地以为我方被俘人员已经不敢升旗的时候，刷地一下子十面五星红旗同时升起，在晴朗的高空里飘扬。敌人慌了手脚，一个小时以后，开来了坦克，调来了端着枪、上了刺刀、戴着防毒面具的美国兵。但是，等敌人冲进铁丝网时，我方被俘人员早已把国旗收藏妥当了。美国人瞪着眼睛指手划脚地吼叫着：限一分钟以内把旗子交出来，否则就要使用暴力。一分钟过去了，敌人的恫吓并没有效果。美军于是用毒气弹、硫酸喷射器向各个帐篷的中国人民志愿军被俘人员甩的甩、喷的喷，又黑又臭的浓烟笼罩了整个战俘营，很多人被打伤了。
    敌人的残暴镇压，只能增加我方被俘人员的仇恨。他们绝不向敌人低头，准备到祖国国庆节的时候，向敌人再一次显示自己热爱祖国、反对美方强迫扣留战俘的不屈意志。
    十月一日前夕，第八战俘营十个营房里的我方被俘人员，怀着激动的心情秘密地挖好了三尺深的旗杆坑，搓好了升旗用的绳子，并把预先找好的水管和帐篷杆子接成四丈高的旗杆。他们还互相留下了家庭通讯处，决心为保护祖国的国旗而献出自己的生命。
    十月一日，我方被俘人员们天不亮就起来了。谁都知道这一天是祖国人民最高兴的日子，毛主席要在天安门上检阅游行的队伍。可是，这一天，关在敌人战俘营里失去自由的人心中更加悲痛，更加思念祖国，谁也吃不下饭。七点钟，各营房分别举行了简短的仪式。他们用自己做的各种乐器奏了国歌、吹过升旗号后，十面鲜艳的红旗——祖国的象征同时升起，迎着海风，在高空飞扬。
    敌人立刻开来十余辆坦克和戴上防毒面具的一个营军队，还有救护车和戴着耳机、背着步行机的美国兵，毒气弹、手榴弹、刺刀、卡宾枪和自动步枪全都带来了。敌人在各个营房里装的扩音器不停地叫着：“降旗！降旗！降旗！”但是被俘人员们只有一个想法：多挂一分钟，就多一分钟的胜利。敌人等了一会，看到红旗仍在高空飘扬，就以一个连的兵力开始冲向七号营房，走在最前边的是直接管理第八战俘营的布鲁克斯上尉。我方被俘人员都叫他“狗大尉”。这个一脸横肉、挺着肚子的上尉，胸前斜挂着一只小手枪，叫被俘人员的代表出来，但谁也不理他。他气得脸色发青，一边掏手枪，一边用中国话说：“你们不吭气？你们不出来？就杀死你们！”大家仍然不理他，他接着又问：“你们不怕死？”这时，我方被俘人员像怒吼似的，一齐以极宏亮的声音说：“我们不怕死！我们已经吃够了你们的半碗饭！我们在你们的手里活够了！”狗大尉脸上的横肉动了一下，冷笑着点点头，走向铁丝网门口的哨房去打电话。不久，一场血腥的屠杀开始了。敌人用各种武器向我方被俘人员集中射击，并向我方被俘人员冲锋四次，许多我方被俘人员倒在血泊中。敌人像一群贪婪的野兽一样，冲进铁丝网，直向旗杆扑去。这时，我方被俘人员的一部分在阻止敌人前进，有两个人在旗杆附近被敌人的子弹打死了，另外两个人冒着敌人密集的火力，迅速把国旗降下，用早已预备好的汽油和碎纸将国旗点燃烧成灰烬。他们宁死也不让国旗落在敌人手中。
    七号营房的国旗降落以后，另外九个营房的国旗也跟着降落了。第八战俘营的中国人民志愿军被俘人员在新中国的国庆日悬旗一个半钟头纪念了自己的节日。在这一天，由于美方对他们的爱国行动进行了残暴的镇压，高勇、马如龙、马何青、邓洪斌等五十六位烈士牺牲了，另外一百零九个人负了伤。
    十月二日，全战俘营的被俘人员们都穿上了白衣，挂上白花，各营房还搭了灵棚，设了牺牲烈士的灵位，灵位旁边写着：“我们的烈士是被美帝国主义杀死的，这就是它按照日内瓦公约对我们的待遇！”十月七日，各营房分别举行了隆重的追悼会，总共做了二百多个花圈，会后大家端着烈士灵位在铁丝网内游行三圈，向美军表示抗议。
    为了纪念这次护旗斗争中牺牲的烈士，第八战俘营的被俘人员们编了一个十月红旗歌：“十月一日的红旗，高空飘扬，我们的鲜血，写下了美帝的血腥罪状。敌人越残暴，我们更坚强。拳头当做刺刀，石头抵住机枪；臂膀靠着臂膀，胸膛筑成铁墙。保卫我们的国旗，打击敌人的疯狂。仇恨结成力量，血债要用血来还偿，万恶的美帝，逃不出世界人民的手掌。十月一日的红旗，高空飘扬，英勇的烈士，永远活在我们的心上。”
    这次遣返回来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，怀着旧仇新恨，激昂地高唱着这个歌，挥动着成百面鲜丽的国旗，回到了祖国的怀抱。
