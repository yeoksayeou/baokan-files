    Tongji University Actively Strengthens Leadership in Departments
    Since the spring of this year, Tongji University has been actively leveraging the role of departments as basic teaching and administrative units in higher education institutions, giving the departments a fresh new look.
    Starting in April this year, the university's Academic Affairs Office and Political Counseling Office transferred a number of capable personnel to work in the departments, further strengthening their capabilities. All six departments in the university are now equipped with political counselors and administrative staff. Department heads are gradually freeing themselves from routine administrative work and beginning to concentrate their efforts on directly leading teaching work. Wang Longfu, head of the Structural Engineering Department, personally led two working groups to carefully revise the teaching plan. Deputy Director Huang Yunyuan delved into a key experiment on "guaranteeing teaching quality" in the first-year classes of the bachelor's degree program in industrial and civil building structures and the specialized program in material inspection. With the help of the political counselor, he mobilized all the teachers, class advisors, and student representatives in these two classes to actively participate in the experiment. Starting with understanding the teaching situation, he spoke with teachers, students, and self-study tutors, and discovered many problems. He said, "In the past, we couldn't see any problems in teaching, but now the problems are all laid out." These problems were resolved in a timely manner after they were discovered. For example, the course "Electrical Engineering" was not a major course for the first-year students in the material inspection program. The content was broad, and the reference materials were deep. The students spent most of their self-study time on it, which affected their learning of other courses. After learning about this situation, he consulted with the relevant teaching and research section and the instructor, clarified the purpose of the course for the major, changed the teaching method, reduced the scope of self-study for students, and changed the disconnection between teaching and learning. The main course "Non-Metallic Materials" was considered boring and lacked systematicity. Everyone thought it was difficult for teachers to teach and difficult for students to learn. He went deep into the Engineering Materials Teaching and Research Section to help teachers improve their teaching methods. After a series of efforts by the teachers, methods such as using specimen materials, projecting slides, and printing reference materials were adopted as aids, which aroused the students' attention and interest in the course. The students also felt that the organization, characteristics, uses, and testing of some of the materials they learned were in order. The departments also paid attention to strengthening the connection between the courses offered by the teaching and research sections. The major course "Architectural Design" in the architectural department's building construction program is related to many courses such as sketching, watercolor painting, Chinese architectural history, building equipment, and building structure. In the past, these courses were not related to each other when they were taught, and they could not cooperate with each other, resulting in the phenomenon of unbalanced course content. Under the leadership of Deputy Director Huang Zuoshen, the department formed a four-person group to specifically study this issue and proposed an improvement plan, specifically determining the position and weight of each course in the major, what should be taught, what should not be taught, what should be taught more, and what should be taught less, so that each teacher understands the role of his or her course in the overall training goal, and makes the integrity and purpose of teaching more clear.
    The departments also used a variety of methods to regularly understand students' learning situations, thereby strengthening the guidance of students' self-study. In the past, the Surveying Department only understood the students' learning performance from exams and tests, and it was not very clear whether the students digested and consolidated the content of the courses they learned in normal times. Since this semester, through measures such as teacher-student seminars, self-study guidance, and sharing of learning experiences, students' daily learning situation can also be grasped in a timely manner. The self-study tutor of the first-year students of the surveying specialization program understands the problems that have not been solved in the learning of the day in the last half hour of the self-study time every night, and guides the students to further study and think. Under the leadership of the department head, the instructors agree on the arrangement of teaching time together every week in advance, and the self-study tutor uniformly arranges the exercises for each course. Therefore, students can seriously implement their personal self-study plans, submit exercises on time, and their learning efficiency has been significantly improved. For example, "Astronomical Surveying" was originally difficult to learn, but in this semester's examination, 58 students received a score of four or five, accounting for about 70 percent of the total number of students in the class.

    同济大学积极加强系的领导工作
    同济大学今年春季以来，积极发挥系在高等学校中教学行政基层单位的作用，使系的工作面貌一新。
    今年四月开始，该校教务处、政治辅导处抽调了一批得力人员到系工作，使系的力量更加充实。全校六个系都配备了政治辅导员和办事人员。系主任逐步摆脱了事务工作，开始集中力量直接领导教学工作。结构系系主任王龙甫亲自领导两个工作小组，认真修订教学计划。副主任黄蕴元深入掌握在工业与民用建筑结构本科一年级、材料检验专修科一年级两个班级中进行“保证教学质量”的重点试验。他在政治辅导员的帮助下，发动这两个班级所有的教师、班主任、学生代表积极参加试验工作。从了解教学情况入手，他分别和教师、学生、自学指导员谈话，发现了不少问题。他说：“过去教学中有什么问题看不见，现在问题都摊开来了。”这些问题在发现后都得到了及时解决。如“电工学”一门课程在材料检验专修科一年级并非主要课程，内容较广泛，参考材料较深，学生们把大部分自学时间放在上面，影响了对其他课程的学习。他在了解这一情况后，就和有关教研室和任课教师研究，从明确认识这一课程对专业的目的性后，改变了讲解方法，压缩了学生的自学范围，改变了教与学的脱节现象。这班主要课程“非金属材料学”内容较枯燥，系统性较差，大家都认为：教师难教、学生难学。他便深入工程材料教研室，帮助教师改进教学方法。经过教师们一系列的努力，采取了用标本材料和放映幻灯、印发参考材料等方法作为辅助，引起了全班学生对这门课程的重视和学习兴趣。学生们也感到所学到的某些材料的组织、特性、用途和检验，都有顺序。各系还注意了加强各教研室所开课程间的联系。建筑系房屋建筑专业主要课程“建筑设计”和素描、水彩画、中国建筑史、建筑设备、建筑构造等许多课程有联系，过去各课在讲授时互不相关，不能互相配合，因此产生课程内容畸重畸轻的现象。该系在副主任黄作燊领导下，成立了四人小组，专门研究了这一问题，提出一个改进方案，具体确定了每一课程在这一专业中所占的地位和应有的份量，那些该讲，那些不讲，那些该多讲，那些该少讲，使每一教师都了解自己所讲课程在总的培养目标中起着什么作用，使教学的整体性和目的性更加明确。
    各系还运用多种多样的方法，经常了解学生学习情况，从而加强了学生自学的指导。测量系以往只从考试和测验中了解一些学生学习的好坏，平时学生们对所学课程的内容是否消化和巩固，不很清楚。这个学期以来，通过师生座谈、自学指导、学习经验交流等措施，对学生日常的学习情况也能及时掌握。测量专修科一年级自学指导员每晚在自修时间最后半小时了解当天学习中尚未解决的问题，引导学生们进一步钻研和思考。任课教师，在系主任的领导下，每周都在一起预先商定教学时间的安排，并由自学指导员统一布置各课习题。学生们因此都能认真执行个人自学计划，按时交习题，学习效率有显著提高。如“天文测量学”原很难学，但在这次学期考试中，有五十八个学生得了四分或五分，约占全班学生人数的百分之七十。（新华社）
