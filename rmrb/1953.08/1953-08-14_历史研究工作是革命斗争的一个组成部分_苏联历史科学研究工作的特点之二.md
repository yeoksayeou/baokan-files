    Historical Research Work as a Component of Revolutionary Struggle
    —The Second Characteristic of Soviet Historical Science Research
    Liu Danian, Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Delegation to the Soviet Union

    Unfettered science research does not exist in the Soviet Union; this is the case for other fields of science, and it is also the case for historical science. Treating historical research work as a component of the revolutionary struggle, and using it to fight against the enemies of the revolution, is the purpose of Soviet historiography and an important characteristic of Soviet historical science.

    Many famous Soviet historians we visited, regardless of their area of expertise, whether they were middle-aged or elderly, unanimously considered themselves to be Soviet fighters. Their responsibility was to combine their scientific research with opposition to all kinds of enemies, and to wage an irreconcilable struggle against all enemies of the Soviet Union. The only effective way to achieve this combination was considered to be through concrete historical facts, promoting Marxist-Leninist doctrine, and promoting communism. Soviet historians told us that, as historians, as long as they deeply understood the objective laws of social and historical development, and neither beautified nor vilified history, they could enable historical science to have an impact on the entire social life and achieve victory in the struggle against the enemies of the revolution.

    In order to realize this principle, Soviet scholars emphasized combining internationalist and patriotic education in accordance with the instructions of Lenin and Stalin. They have done a lot of important work in this regard. For example, conducting comprehensive research on Soviet modern history, fully explaining that the history of Soviet society is the history of overthrowing the old system, carrying out great socialist transformation work, and victoriously carrying out communist construction under the leadership of the party of Lenin and Stalin as the first socialist society. The various aspects of Soviet modern history are studied topically, separately explaining the great socialist construction process; the realization of Soviet state industrialization and agricultural collectivization; the Soviet cultural revolution and the development of Soviet democracy; the heroic struggle of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union during the Great Patriotic War, and so on. Another example is conducting specialized research on the history of various ethnic groups within the Soviet Union, elaborating on all the most fundamental issues in the historical development of various ethnic groups. There are more than fifty ethnic groups within the Soviet Union, many of which did not have their own historical records in the past, and some did not have writing before the October Socialist Revolution. Through the efforts of Soviet historians and archaeologists, many histories related to the formation of various allied republics and autonomous republics have now been written. Such as the history of Ukraine, the history of Belarus, the history of Latvia, the history of Yakutsk, the history of Buryat-Mongolia, the history of Tajikistan, the history of Kazakhstan, the history of Kyrgyzstan, the history of Georgia, the history of Central Asia, and so on. All these works emphasize the brilliant achievements of Lenin's and Stalin's ethnic policies, explaining that socialist multinational states based on public ownership can unite people of all ethnic groups for common prosperity and common development; conversely, multinational bourgeois states based on capitalist ownership will inevitably lead to internal struggles among all ethnic groups and the division of all ethnic groups. At the same time, these works also specifically point out the great assistance that the Russian people and the Russian working class have provided to other ethnic groups, and promote the idea of unity and cooperation among all ethnic groups within the Soviet Union through concrete facts.

    While conducting patriotic education, Soviet scholars paid special attention to criticizing bourgeois ideology and exposing bourgeois falsification of history in their work. Bourgeois ideology can have various manifestations in history. Such as bourgeois nationalist ideology and bourgeois objectivist ideology, they carry banners of different colors, but they have a common characteristic, that is, obliterating the class struggle in history and promoting anti-Marxist views. One of the constant tasks of Soviet scholars is to criticize the essence of this kind of thinking in a timely manner and eliminate the remaining influence of bourgeois thinking in the minds of some people. In many historical works in the Soviet Union, everyone can clearly see this.

    An important task that Soviet historians are currently undertaking is to compile a voluminous world history. They say that in the past, bourgeois scholars wrote many books on world history, but what bourgeois scholars mainly talked about was the history of Europe and the United States, and they talked very little about Russia, the Soviet Union, and Eastern countries. The purpose is to promote the idea of "Eurocentrism." Now, the world history being compiled by Soviet scholars is to study the history of various countries in the world from the perspective and method of Marxism-Leninism, criticize the absurd and erroneous views of the bourgeoisie, and show the organic connection between the development of the East and the West.

    Soviet historians emphasized that reactionary bourgeois scholars are currently shamelessly using history to serve aggressive wars. Capitalist countries have published a large number of pseudo-scientific works. There, apologists for American imperialism are doing their best to promote "cosmopolitanism," attempting to historically prove that the arrogant attempt to pursue world hegemony is justified. They praise American false democracy, fabricate the history of World War II and the post-war years, and pave the way for imperialist aggressive wars. Soviet historical science has the responsibility to expose the ugly faces of these historical falsifiers, profoundly explain the historical experience accumulated by the world democratic and socialist camp in the struggle against imperialist aggressive forces, and help people better understand the essence of current events and their development direction. The research plan of the Institute of History of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1953 stipulated that a discussion meeting on exposing the falsification of modern history by American and British imperialism would be held in May this year to systematically expose the shameless fabrication of the history of the Second World War period and the history of the Soviet Union by American and British imperialism.

    The study of the history of the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world and the history of the world communist movement is also valued by Soviet historians. They have carried out a lot of research work to oppose imperialist aggression and expand the influence of the world people's struggle for peace and democracy. Such as studying the workers' movement in capitalist countries, the liberation struggle of the people in colonies and semi-colonies, the history of the revolutionary victory and economic and cultural construction achievements of the people's democratic countries, and the history of the upsurge of the world peace and democratic movement.

    The general history of China currently being compiled by Soviet historians belongs to this aspect of work. The task of this work is to discuss the history of China from ancient times to the present. It is necessary to explain the characteristics of the formation and alternation of China's various socio-economic formations, and the role of class struggle and people's movements in the development of Chinese society. It should not only clarify the political and economic development of great China, but also clarify its cultural development. For the modern history part of China, it is necessary to analyze the influence of the great October Socialist Revolution on the Chinese liberation struggle, and also expose the aggressive policy of American imperialism attempting to enslave the Chinese people and turn China into a colony. Finally, it is also necessary to explain the achievements of the social, economic, and cultural reforms of the new China, which is now gradually transitioning to socialism.

    Soviet scholars paid special attention to the speech made by Stalin at the 19th Party Congress, believing that this speech put forward the task of studying the history of the world communist movement to Soviet historical science. According to Stalin's instructions, some research units have already included some new topics in their plans, such as the impact of the October Socialist Revolution on the class struggle in various capitalist countries, and the communist movement in various capitalist countries. In these topics, the history of the development of the world communist movement will be scientifically elaborated.

    It is obvious that the many scientific research projects being undertaken by Soviet historiography are of great practical significance. It has a close connection with people's current practical life. It is not only indispensable for helping the Soviet Party and government educate the people to advance towards communism, but also indispensable for helping the people of the world victoriously carry out the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    In the past, there was a Pokrovsky faction in Soviet historiography that believed that politics and history had nothing to do with each other. They opposed combining historical research with real life and advocated dealing with historical issues with objectivism, which only led to anti-historicism. Soviet historians pointed out that, contrary to Pokrovsky, we believe that Marxism-Leninism helps people understand the past and also understand the present, and the two are inseparable. Marx himself summarized the historical experience of mankind and came to the scientific conclusion of communism, which has a great enlightening effect on all advanced people.

    Today, bourgeois historical scholars have never neglected the fundamental purpose of serving the interests of the bourgeoisie in their works, but they do not dare to say this fact and want to deny it categorically. This is because their arguments are based on fabricating history and distorting historical truth. The bourgeoisie is the last class in human history that is approaching death. It is impossible not to do this for the interests of its class, and it is impossible to escape death by doing so.

    In China, we have encountered some young comrades who doubt what role historical science plays in our current great construction cause. After understanding the purposefulness of Soviet historical science, I think this question can be explained in this way: on the revolutionary battlefield, people can use all kinds of weapons, and history is one of them. If it is used well, it can be used to effectively strike at the enemy. According to Soviet historians, historical science is one of the most effective weapons in the hands of communists at any time. The question is how to improve our ability to master this science while standing on the post of historical work.

    历史研究工作是革命斗争的一个组成部分
    ——苏联历史科学研究工作的特点之二
    中国科学院访苏代表团团员  刘大年
    没有明确目的的科学研究工作在苏联是不存在的，其他门类的科学是这样，历史科学也是这样。把历史研究工作作为革命斗争的一个组成部分，通过它来和革命的敌人作斗争，这是苏联史学研究的目的，也是苏联历史科学的一个重要特点。
    我们拜访过的苏联许多著名的史学家，不管他们是那个范围内的专家，也不管他们是壮年人或老年人，都一致地认为自己是苏维埃的战士，他们的责任是把自己的科学研究和反对各式各样的敌人相结合，同一切苏维埃的敌人进行不调和的斗争。被认为是这种结合的唯一有效方式，就是通过具体的历史事实，宣传马克思列宁主义学说，宣传共产主义。苏联史学家告诉我们：作为历史学家，只要深刻认识了社会历史发展的客观法则，不把历史美化，也不把历史丑化，就能够使历史科学在整个社会生活中发生影响，在和革命的敌人作斗争中取得胜利。
    为了实现这个原则，苏联学者强调要根据列宁、斯大林的指示，把国际主义和爱国主义教育结合起来。关于这方面，他们做了很多重要工作。例如对苏联现代史进行综合性的研究，全面地说明苏维埃社会的历史是推翻旧制度，进行了伟大的社会主义改造工作，并在列宁、斯大林党的领导下胜利进行共产主义建设的第一个社会主义社会的历史。对苏联现代史的各方面则进行专题研究，分别说明伟大的社会主义建设过程；苏联国家工业化与农业集体化的实现；苏维埃的文化革命与苏维埃民主的发展；卫国战争期间苏联各族人民的英勇斗争等等。又如对苏联境内各民族的历史进行专门研究，阐述各民族历史发展中一切最根本的问题。苏联境内有五十多个民族，其中许多民族过去没有自己的历史记载，有的在十月社会主义革命以前没有文字。经过苏联史学家、考古学家们的努力，现在已经写出多种有关各加盟共和国、自治共和国形成的历史。如乌克兰史、白俄罗斯史、拉脱维亚史、雅库斯克史、布利亚蒙古史、塔吉克史、哈萨克斯坦史、吉尔吉斯史、格鲁吉亚史、中亚细亚史等等。在所有这些著作中，都强调说明列宁、斯大林民族政策的光辉成就，说明以公有制为基础的社会主义多民族国家能够把各民族的人民团结在一起，共同繁荣，共同发展；反之，以资本主义所有制为基础的多民族的资产阶级国家，必不可免地引向各族人民内部的斗争，各民族的分裂。同时，这些著作也具体指出俄罗斯人民以及俄罗斯工人阶级对其他各族人民所作的巨大帮助，通过具体事实宣传苏联境内各族人民团结合作的思想。
    与进行爱国主义教育的同时，苏联学者们特别注意在自己的工作中批判资产阶级思想、揭穿资产阶级对历史的伪造。资产阶级思想在历史学中可以有各种各样的表现。如资产阶级民族主义思想和资产阶级客观主义思想，它们打着不同色彩的旗子，但是有一个共同的特点，那就是抹煞历史的阶级斗争，宣传反马克思主义观点。苏联学者的经常任务之一，是要及时地批判这种思想的实质，清除某些人思想中的资产阶级思想的残余影响。在苏联的许多历史著作中，大家都可以很清楚地看到这一点。
    目前苏联史学家正在进行的一项重要工作，是编写卷帙浩繁的世界史。他们说，以往资产阶级学者写了许多关于世界史的著作，但是资产阶级学者所讲的主要是欧美的历史，对俄国、苏联及东方各国讲得很少。其目的是宣传“欧美中心”主义思想。现在，苏联学者正在编写的世界史，是要以马克思列宁主义的观点和方法研究世界各国的历史，批判资产阶级的荒谬、错误的观点，把东方和西方发展的有机联系表现出来。
    苏联历史学家着重指出：目前反动的资产阶级学者正在可耻地利用历史学为侵略战争服务。资本主义国家出版了大量的伪科学著作。在那里，美国帝国主义的辩护士们，竭力宣传“世界主义”，试图从历史上证明追求世界霸权的狂妄企图是合理的。他们颂扬美国的假民主，捏造第二次世界大战和战后年代的历史，替帝国主义进行侵略战争开辟道路。苏联的历史科学有责任揭穿这些历史伪造者的丑恶面目，深刻地阐明世界民主和社会主义阵营在反对帝国主义侵略势力的斗争中所积累的历史经验，帮助人们更好地了解现在事件的本质及其发展方向。苏联科学院历史研究所一九五三年的研究计划中，就规定要在今年五月间举行关于揭露美英帝国主义伪造现代历史的讨论会，来系统地揭发美英帝国主义对第二次世界大战时期的历史和对苏联历史的无耻捏造。
    研究世界人民革命斗争和世界共产主义运动的历史，也为苏联史学家所重视。他们为反对帝国主义的侵略，扩大世界人民争取和平民主斗争的影响，进行了许多研究工作。如研究资本主义国家的工人运动，殖民地半殖民地人民的解放斗争，人民民主国家的革命胜利和经济、文化建设成就的历史，世界和平民主运动高涨的历史，等等。
    现在苏联史学家正在编写的中国通史，就是属于这方面的工作。这部著作的任务，是要论述中国从远古到现在的历史。它要说明中国各个社会经济形态的形成及其交替的特点，阶级斗争和人民运动在中国社会发展中的作用。它不仅要阐明伟大中国的政治和经济的发展，同时也要阐明它的文化发展。对于中国现代史部分，将要分析伟大十月社会主义革命对中国解放斗争的影响，还要揭露美帝国主义企图奴役中国人民，把中国变为殖民地的侵略政策。最后也要说明要逐步过渡到社会主义的现在的新中国的社会经济和文化改革的成就。
    苏联学者特别注意到，斯大林在十九次党代表大会上的演说，认为这个演说对苏联历史科学提出了研究世界共产主义运动的历史的任务。根据斯大林的指示，有些研究单位已经在他们的计划中列入一些新的题目，如十月社会主义革命对各资本主义国家阶级斗争的影响，各资本主义国家的共产主义运动等。在这些题目中，将要科学地阐述世界共产主义运动发展的历史。
    十分明显，苏联史学界正在从事的这许多科学研究，都是有极大的现实意义的。它和人们当前的实际生活有着密切的联系，不但对于帮助苏联党和政府教育人民向共产主义前进是不可缺少的，对于帮助世界人民胜利地进行争取和平民主和社会主义的斗争也是不可缺少的。
    在过去，苏联史学界中有过波克罗夫斯基一派，认为政治和历史没有关系。他们反对把历史研究和现实生活相结合，主张用客观主义处理历史问题，结果只有引导到反历史主义。苏联史学家指出：和波克罗夫斯基相反，我们认为马克思列宁主义帮助人们了解过去，也了解现在，这两者是不可分割的。马克思本人总结了人类的历史经验之后，得出了科学的共产主义的结论，这对所有先进的人们有着极大的启示作用。
    今天资产阶级的历史学者，在他们的作品中从来没有忽视过为资产阶级利益服务的根本目的，但是他们不敢说出这个事实，并且要矢口否认。这是由于他们的论点是建筑在虚构历史和歪曲历史真相的基础上的。资产阶级是人类历史上一个迫近死亡的最后阶级，为了本阶级的利益，不这样做是不可能的，而这样做，想逃避死亡也是不可能的。
    在中国，我们碰到有些青年同志，他们怀疑历史科学在我国当前的伟大建设事业中究竟有什么作用。在我了解了苏联历史科学的目的性之后，认为可以这样解释这个问题：在革命战场上人们可以使用各种各样的武器，历史学是其中的一种，如果使用得好，就能利用它来有效地打击敌人。按照苏联史学家的说法是：历史科学在任何时候都是共产党人手中最有效的武器之一，问题是在于站在历史工作的岗位上，应该如何来提高我们掌握这门科学的能力。
