(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 19th) According to the "Canadian Tribune" on the 17th, Libby Park, Executive Secretary of the Toronto Peace Council, issued a statement to the press on August 10th on behalf of the Toronto Peace Council, condemning the "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed between Dulles and Syngman Rhee, as well as the so-called "Sixteen-Nation Declaration."

The statement denounced the treaty as "shamelessly disregarding the Korean Armistice Agreement – an agreement reached after so much bloodshed and to which people attach great hope for maintaining peace in Korea."

The statement said: "The Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that the upcoming political conference will discuss the issue of withdrawing foreign troops from Korea. Dulles and Syngman Rhee's new treaty undermines this, stipulating that American troops will remain in Korea.

"One of the problems to be solved by the political conference is to achieve the unification of Korea on the basis of an agreement reached by the Korean people. Dulles and Syngman Rhee's treaty is based on maintaining the division of Korea."

The statement pointed out: "It is clear that if the future political conference is to yield results, people must make great efforts to insist on resolving differences through consultation in a friendly spirit, and both sides must strive for the success of the conference, not for its failure."

The statement called on every advocate of peace in Korea to visit their new Member of Parliament and "tell him that the Canadian people demand peace in Korea, no matter how long the negotiations will take, and tell him that we do not want to wage a new war for Syngman Rhee."

(Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 20th) TASS, Bangkok, 19th: The Thai magazine "Praya Mitr," regarding Dulles' recent statement about the attitude the United States might take at the political conference discussing the Korean issue, wrote: "This statement is very serious. No one participating in a conference has ever announced in advance that he would abandon the conference. Peace is a sacred word. It has great significance and cannot be easily ignored." The magazine pointed out: "The political atmosphere manifested by the Korean armistice has been dimmed by Dulles' statement." The magazine further emphasized: "The Korean armistice may cause dissatisfaction among people like Syngman Rhee, or certain politicians and warmongers, but at least the Korean armistice can satisfy the soldiers fighting in Korea and their parents, brothers, sisters, and relatives. Although the armistice does not mean peace, it at least helps to stop the bloodshed in Korea and makes it possible to revive Korea and aid the Korean people."

(Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 22nd) The Indian newspaper "New Age" expressed dissatisfaction with the secret agreement concluded between Dulles and Syngman Rhee and condemned the provocative attack by the US side on the representatives of the Chinese and Korean sides in the Joint Red Cross team.

The "New Age" editorial on August 20th wrote: "The attitude of the American warmongers towards the upcoming political conference on the Korean issue has dissatisfied all circles of people in India. Although some people desperately tried to sabotage the armistice negotiations, the armistice agreement was finally signed. Afterwards, Dulles hurriedly went to Syngman Rhee and concluded an agreement with him to allow American troops to continue to stay in South Korea. They also plan to invalidate this political conference in order to launch the war again."

"New Age" pointed out on August 19 that the US military authorities repeatedly violated the Korean Armistice Agreement, attacking the representatives of the Chinese and Korean sides in the Joint Red Cross team with rifles and poison gas. "The purpose of this violation of the agreement is very obvious: that is to create obstacles to obstruct the implementation of the armistice agreement and to provoke. But this anti-peace behavior cannot achieve their goals. The warmongers are bound to fail in the face of the firm peace policy of the Chinese and Korean sides and the vigilance of the people of all countries in the world."

    加拿大多伦多和平理事会
    斥责美国和李承晚签订“共同防御条约”
    印、泰两国舆论抨击杜勒斯对政治会议的态度
    【新华社柏林十九日电】据“加拿大论坛报”十七日消息说，多伦多和平理事会执行书记利比·帕克代表多伦多和平理事会于八月十日向报界发表声明，斥责杜勒斯与李承晚之间签订的“共同防御条约”以及所谓“十六国宣言”。
    声明指责这一条约是“悍然不顾朝鲜的停战协定——在流了如此多鲜血以后所达成的协定并为人们寄予极大希望来维持朝鲜和平的协定。”
    声明说：“朝鲜停战协定规定，即将来到的政治会议将讨论从朝鲜撤退外国军队的事宜。杜勒斯和李承晚的新条约却破坏了这一条，而规定美国军队将留驻朝鲜。
    “政治会议所要解决的问题之一是在朝鲜人民达成协议的基础上求得朝鲜的统一。杜勒斯和李承晚的条约却是基于保持朝鲜的分裂。”
    声明指出：“很显然，假如要使未来的政治会议得到结果，人民就必须以巨大的努力坚持本着友善的精神在协商中解决分歧，双方要为会议的成功而努力，而不是为会议的失败而努力。”
    声明号召每一个主张朝鲜和平的人去访问他们的新国会议员，“告诉他，加拿大人民要求朝鲜和平，不管谈判将进行多久，并告诉他，我们不愿为了李承晚而进行新的战争。”
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社曼谷十九日讯：泰国“帕雅米特尔”杂志就杜勒斯最近关于美国在讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议上可能采取的态度的声明写道：“这个声明是十分严重的。从来没有一个参加会议的人事先就宣布他要抛弃会议。和平是一个神圣的字眼。它具有重大的意义，不能这么轻易地忽视它。”杂志指出：“由于朝鲜停战而表现出来的政治气氛，被杜勒斯的这个声明弄得黯淡起来了。”杂志进一步强调说：“朝鲜停战可能引起像李承晚这一类人、或是某些政客和黩武主义者的不满，但是，朝鲜停战至少能使在朝鲜作战的士兵以及他们的父母、兄弟、姊妹和亲戚满意。虽然停战并不就意味着和平，但是，停战至少有助于停止朝鲜的流血，使复兴朝鲜和援助朝鲜人民成为可能。”
    【新华社新德里二十二日电】印度“新世纪报”对于杜勒斯和李承晚缔结的秘密协定表示不满，并谴责美方对联合红十字会小组中朝代表的挑衅性的袭击。
    “新世纪报”八月二十日的社论写道：“美国战争贩子们对于即将召开的关于朝鲜问题的政治会议的态度，已使印度各界人民不满。尽管有人拚命要破坏停战谈判，但停战协定终于签字了，事后，杜勒斯急急忙忙到李承晚那里去，和他缔结协定，让美军继续留驻在南朝鲜。他们又计划使这次政治会议失去效用，以便再度发动战争。”
    “新世纪报”在八月十九日曾指出，美国军事当局一再违反朝鲜停战协定，以步枪和毒气攻击联合红十字会小组中朝代表。“这种违反协定的目的是很明显的；那就是制造障碍阻挠停战协定的实施，并进行挑衅。但是这种反和平的行为是不可能达到它们的目的的。战争贩子们在中朝方面的坚定的和平政策和全世界各国人民的警惕面前，是一定要遭到失败的。”
