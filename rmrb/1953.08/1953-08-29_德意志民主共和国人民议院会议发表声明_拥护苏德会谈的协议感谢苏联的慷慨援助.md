Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 27th via TASS: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic continued its session on August 26th. Eight representatives from various parties and organizations within the Chamber delivered speeches on Premier Grotewohl's report regarding the talks held in Moscow by the delegation of the German Democratic Republic.

The speaking representatives unanimously supported the talks and the resulting agreements. They expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their generous assistance and support. They stated that the Soviet-German Communiqué and the protocols signed in Moscow greatly contribute to the cause of defending world peace, to resolving the German question, consolidating the economy of the German Democratic Republic, and further improving the republic's living standards.

Deputy Premier Ulbricht of the German Democratic Republic spoke on behalf of the Socialist Unity Party's parliamentary group.

Ulbricht emphasized that it is now time for Germans to sit down at a table to hold talks. Germans must decide whether to take the path of peaceful resolution of the German question through mutual understanding, or the path of the American imperialists and the Adenauer group, the path of war. Ulbricht exposed Adenauer's opposition to holding Four-Power talks, opposition to holding free all-German elections, and his demand that Western countries create preconditions in advance to make all-German elections impossible, stubbornly refusing to establish an all-German provisional government. He pointed out that this is Adenauer's attempt to gain time to complete the re-militarization of West Germany.

In his speech, Ulbricht also exposed the role of the right-wing leadership of the German Social Democratic Party as lackeys of American and British imperialism. Ulbricht said that Ollenhauer opposes holding all-German talks because he is unwilling to damage his relations with certain American and British groups. If the Social Democratic leadership was not so eager to please Washington and London and could listen to the opinions of the workers and ordinary members of the Social Democratic Party, all-German talks would not be delayed for so long.

Ulbricht suggested large-scale exchanges of worker delegations between the two parts of Germany as an important method of strengthening ties between residents of East and West Germany.

Ulbricht finally emphasized that the Soviet people's decision to supply the German people with a large amount of food and raw materials obliges the German people to improve production and increase productivity with greater effort.

Ulbricht's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause.

The People's Chamber then unanimously passed a formal declaration.

【Xinhua News Agency, August 28th】According to TASS, Berlin, August 27th: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic passed a declaration at its meeting on August 26th.

The declaration states: The People's Chamber notes with great satisfaction that the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic hold identical views on some fundamental issues concerning Germany. Germany wants to end the division of Germany. Germany demands the establishment of a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and demands the conclusion of a peace treaty with such a Germany. To achieve this goal, a peace conference should be convened in the near future, and it should be ensured that German representatives participate in all preparatory stages of the treaty and at the peace conference. Negotiations between Germans should be initiated immediately to organize an all-German provisional government. One of the main tasks of this all-German provisional government should be to prepare for and hold free all-German elections, so that our people can solve the national, social, and economic structure of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany themselves without foreign interference.

The declaration states: The Soviet government's note of August 15, 1953, and the results of the talks with the delegation of the German Democratic Republic provide extremely valuable and immeasurable assistance to Germany, especially to the German Democratic Republic. The declaration states: This enormous political and economic support places an obligation on the German people to intensify their efforts to raise their living standards and to fight for peace.

The declaration expresses gratitude to the government of the People's Republic of Poland for exempting Germany from further reparations to Poland.

The declaration also expresses gratitude to all other countries in the world peace camp that are continuing to supply the German Democratic Republic with materials.

The declaration points out that the Moscow agreements once again prove that the Soviet government is steadfastly implementing its great policy of peace and its policy of trusting the peaceful and democratic forces of Germany. This policy principle of Soviet foreign policy is also reflected in the strong assistance to the national economy of the German Democratic Republic, which is the expansion of material supplies and loans to the German Democratic Republic. Thanks to this assistance, the living standards of the people will be further improved in the future. Every German has once again seen that the policy of friendship with the Soviet Union and other countries in the world's peace and democracy camp, the establishment of the most friendly relations with the people of all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and the policy of peaceful economic construction pursued by the government of the German Democratic Republic are beneficial to all the German people. Adenauer's policy, on the other hand, is a continuation of Hitler's policy, which carries the danger of dragging Germany into a new and terrible catastrophe. Therefore, the task facing West Germany now is to overthrow Adenauer in the election on September 6, abandon his policies, and reach an all-German agreement on the issue of restoring Germany's unity and on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible.

The declaration reiterates that the People's Chamber is willing to join the West German Bundestag in establishing an all-German provisional government responsible for immediately starting preparations for holding free all-German elections.

The declaration calls on all the people of eastern and western Germany to strive with all their strength to establish a unified, independent, peace-loving, and democratic Germany and to conclude a peace treaty.

    德意志民主共和国人民议院会议发表声明
    拥护苏德会谈的协议感谢苏联的慷慨援助
    据新华社讯：据塔斯社柏林二十七日讯：德意志民主共和国人民议院八月二十六日继续举行会议。议院中八位不同党派不同组织的代表，就格罗提渥总理关于德意志民主共和国代表团在莫斯科所进行的会谈的报告发表了演说。
    发言代表一致拥护这次会谈以及会谈所得出的协议。他们对于苏联政府以及苏联人民给予他们的慷慨援助与支持表示衷心的感谢。他们说，苏德会谈公报以及在莫斯科签订的议定书，大有助于保卫世界和平的事业，有助于解决德国问题、巩固德意志民主共和国的经济并进一步提高共和国的生活水平。
    德意志民主共和国副总理乌布利希代表德国统一社会党人民议院党团小组发言。
    乌布利希强调，现在已经是德国人坐到一张桌子上来举行会谈的时候了，德国人必须决定，是要采取和平解决德国问题互相达成谅解的道路呢，还是采取美帝国主义和阿登纳集团的道路、战争的道路？乌布利希揭露阿登纳反对举行四国会谈，反对举行全德自由选举而要求西方国家预先制造条件使得全德选举成为不可能，顽固地拒绝成立全德临时政府的立场，指出这是阿登纳想取得时间来完成西德的重新军国主义化。
    乌布利希在发言中也揭露了德国社会民主党右翼领导集团充当美英帝国主义走卒的角色。乌布利希说，奥伦豪尔反对举行全德会谈，因为他不愿意损害他和某些美国与英国集团的关系。如果社会民主党领导机构不是这样地讨好华盛顿和伦敦而能够听一听工人群众和社会民主党的普通党员们的意见，全德会谈就不会长久拖延不举行。
    乌布利希建议大规模地从德国的两部分互派工人代表团，作为密切东德与西德居民之间联系的一个重要方法。
    乌布利希最后强调说，苏联人民决定供给德国人民以大量的食物和原料，使得德国人民有义务以更大的努力来改进生产，提高生产率。
    乌布利希的发言一再为热烈的掌声所打断。
    人民议院然后一致通过了一个正式声明。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十七日讯：德意志民主共和国人民议院在八月二十六日的会议上通过了一项声明。
    声明说：人民议院非常满意地指出，在德国的一些基本问题上，苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府具有一致的观点。德国要结束德国的分裂局面。德国要求建立一个统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国，并要求与这样一个德国签订和约。为了达到这一目的，短期内即应召开和平会议，同时应该保证，在和约的一切准备阶段以及举行和平会议时，都要有德国代表参加。应立即通过德国人之间的协商，组织一个全德临时政府。这一全德临时政府的主要任务之一应该是筹备和举行全德自由选举，以便我国人民在没有外国干涉的情况下，自己解决统一、民主和爱好和平的德国的国家、社会和经济结构的问题。
    声明说：苏联政府一九五三年八月十五日的照会以及与德意志民主共和国政府代表团的会谈结果，对于德国，特别是德意志民主共和国有极大的、无可估价的帮助。声明说：这种巨大的政治上和经济上的支援给德国人民增加了一项义务：加紧努力为提高自己的生活水平和为保障和平而斗争。
    声明对波兰人民共和国政府免除德国继续向波兰赔款表示感谢。
    声明并感谢世界和平阵营其他一切国家现在继续以物资供应德意志民主共和国。
    声明指出，莫斯科各项协议再一次证明了，苏联政府坚持不渝地执行它的伟大的和平政策和信任德国和平民主力量的政策。苏联对外政策的这一政策原则也表现在大力援助德意志民主共和国国民经济方面，这就是对德意志民主共和国扩大物资供应和对它的贷款。由于这些援助，今后人民的生活水平必将进一步提高。每一个德国人又一次看到了，德意志民主共和国政府执行的对苏联及世界和平民主阵营其他国家友好的政策，在平等互利基础上与一切国家人民建立最友好关系及进行和平经济建设的政策，是对全体德国人民都有好处的。而阿登纳的政策却是希特勒政策的继续，这种政策有把德国卷进新的可怕的浩劫的危险。因此，西德现在面临的任务就是在九月六日的选举中推翻阿登纳，摒弃他的政策并在恢复德国的统一的问题上，在尽速缔结对德和约的问题上达成全德协议。
    声明并再次表示，人民议院愿意会同西德联邦议院成立全德临时政府，负责立即着手准备举行全德自由选举。
    声明号召德国东部与西部全体人民全力奋斗，争取建立一个统一、独立、爱好和平与民主的德国并缔结和约。
