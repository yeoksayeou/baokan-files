    It is imperative to rapidly strengthen leadership over geological work
    The immense importance of geological work to national construction is well known. However, because old China was for a long time under the dark rule of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, a regular geological work system was never established, and a comprehensive and accurate geological survey was never seriously carried out. Therefore, the mineral resources of our country are still largely unclear; even the information known in the past is extremely inaccurate and incomplete. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the People's Government has strived to strengthen geological work. In the past three years, the number of geological workers and drilling rigs has increased significantly, and many geophysical prospecting teams with modern exploration equipment have also begun to be formed. However, compared with the requirements of our national economic construction plan, our current geological work still lags far behind the needs of national economic construction. This urgently needs to be changed.
    The backwardness of China's geological work is mainly manifested in two aspects: one is that the geological work force is weak, small in number, low in technology, and poor in equipment, and cannot provide the state design departments with the geological data required for various construction projects in a timely manner, so that many designs cannot be carried out, and national construction work is affected. For example, the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry planned to build and restore or rebuild 40 mines according to the entire national plan, but because these mines lacked sufficient geological data, most of the construction plans were forced to be postponed. In the Central Heavy Industry Ministry and other departments, there are also some factories and mines that cannot be designed because they do not have accurate geological data. The other aspect of the backwardness of geological work is that geological workers and their leaders have serious subjectivism and blindness in their work, ignoring the scientific procedures of geological work (for example, carrying out drilling and tunneling without geological surveys, trenching, or geophysical prospecting; carrying out the construction of production mines without drilling and tunneling; blindly drilling without drilling design, etc.), resulting in many errors in geological work. Many construction project designs have caused many fundamental errors due to incorrect geological data; and many construction projects have not followed the procedures of geological work, resulting in huge losses. A new inclined shaft project in the Xi'an Coal Mine invested 14 billion yuan for mining because it mistakenly estimated that there were 2.5 million tons of coal reserves there. Now it is found that there is very little coal reserve. The Zhongnan Iron and Steel Company dug a clay pit without conducting geological surveys, and made 32 inclined shafts in an area of 10 kilometers long, spending a lot of money. Later, it was found that the clay reserves were very small, causing huge waste. A lead mine in a certain place only found a little "outcrop" on the surface. Without geophysical prospecting and drilling, and without further understanding the geological situation, it blindly carried out tunneling. After excavating to the 50-meter middle section, it still did not see the ore body, and it was only then realized that the outcrop had originally shown a "pinch-out" phenomenon.
    There are many reasons for the backwardness of geological work. First of all, many leading cadres responsible for industrial construction lack experience and do not fully recognize the importance of geological work. They do not deeply realize that to engage in industrial construction, without strong geological work and without accurate resource surveys, it is impossible to move forward even one step, and even the existing normal production will not be able to continue. Because of insufficient understanding, they did not put geological work on an important agenda, and did not take effective measures to strengthen this weak link early. Many departments have not established geological work organizations that are compatible with basic construction tasks for a long time, and have not organized the existing geological personnel well, and expanded the strength of geological work in all aspects, so that geological work lacks leadership and forces are scattered. Some departments have one-sidedly emphasized design and construction, while ignoring geological work, and do not know that geology is the foundation of design and construction. Without correct geological work, design and construction are impossible. Some people only focused on drilling, supply, and finance in their work, but did not focus on the most important geological work. They do not know that drilling is only a subordinate work of geology, only a means of geological work. Without first understanding the geology, drilling will inevitably lose its direction and produce many errors. Obviously, if geological work is not done well first, basic construction work cannot move forward.
    Secondly, there are still many shortcomings in our existing geological workers, especially the various erroneous ideological viewpoints among them have not been strictly criticized, and the efforts to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union are far from enough, so it is difficult to change the current backward state of technology. For example, some geological personnel have long been accustomed to academic research that is divorced from reality, so they still show a lack of clear understanding of the purpose of geological work in their actual work, and do not understand that the sole purpose of geological work is to obtain industrial resources. They often deviate from this purpose in their work, spending a lot of time and money, but the result is useless. In many geological work departments, a system of regularly checking and summarizing work has not been established, and the hidden errors in the work cannot be discovered in time, and therefore experience cannot be summarized from this to improve everyone's work level. In recent years, various industrial departments have supplemented a lot of new geological workers from production departments and schools and training classes. This is an extremely valuable force. The input of this new blood has greatly expanded the geological team. They are generally enthusiastic, lack practical experience, and have a low technical level. Therefore, organizing them to carry out various studies and exercises in combination with practical work to improve their technical level is a work of great significance. However, many geological departments have not done enough to carry out planned training and education for them in combination with practical work, resulting in the failure of this new force to grow rapidly, and the work efficiency still cannot be improved. All of the above undoubtedly hinders the exertion of the potential strength of existing geological personnel.
    Strengthening the leadership of geological work should now be placed on the most important agenda of the leaders of various departments responsible for industrial construction. Some department leaders have now realized this problem and have actively strengthened the leadership of this work, which is completely necessary. In order to quickly and effectively overcome the current backward situation in geological work, while strengthening organizational construction and ideological leadership, the leading departments must also focus on specific business leadership of the geological departments. According to many past lessons, the main business aspects to focus on are the following: First, geological work should generally be carried out in accordance with the geological survey and exploration procedures, that is, the survey of a mining area should generally first carry out a general geological survey of the mining area (prospecting) and make a detailed investigation plan; the second step is to conduct necessary detailed investigation of the mining area (including trenching, geophysical prospecting and necessary drilling), make detailed geological and topographic maps of the mining area, and make a prospecting design; The third step is to conduct detailed investigation of the mining area, conduct drilling and tunneling, and make geological conclusions. Only after the above three steps can the mine design be carried out and the mine construction can be carried out. Mines that have not been prospected in accordance with the necessary geological exploration procedures in the past should gradually and systematically make detailed geological and topographic maps of the mining area in the future in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the geological conditions of the mining area. Second, carefully do a good job in prospecting design. Whether the prospecting design is correct will determine whether the results of drilling and tunneling can find a large amount of minerals. Therefore, in the future, whenever a large amount of drilling and tunneling is carried out, there must be a prospecting design, and these designs must be reviewed and approved by the leadership and experts. Third, improve the quality of drilling and tunneling. Geological workers should closely cooperate with drilling workers to make the drilling work meet the requirements of geological work. Drilling (including tunneling) must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the prospecting design, and must not violate the design regulations. It is necessary to increase the core recovery rate, strengthen core management, carefully record the original data, reduce drilling accidents, and improve the efficiency of drilling operations. Fourth, strengthen sampling, chemical analysis and physical identification, and establish chemical analysis institutions to balance the analysis capacity with the entire geological drilling force. Fifth, mines that have been prospected must make complete geological conclusions, not only to draw conclusions on the geological conditions, but also to draw conclusions on its economic value, and to draw conclusions on whether it has the conditions for industrial construction. In the future, geological departments must implement the above five points in their work and should not repeat the mistakes of the past.
    Our geological work comrades have done a lot of work in the past few years and have made valuable contributions to the great cause of the motherland's industrialization. However, in order to meet the needs of China's developing industrial construction, geological work must have a major transformation and improvement. This is a glorious and great task, and all geological workers should bravely take it up.

    必须迅速加强对地质工作的领导
    地质工作对于国家建设的巨大重要性是人所共知的。但是由于旧中国长期处在帝国主义和官僚资本主义的黑暗统治之下，从来没有建立起一套正规的地质工作，从来没有认真进行过一次全面的精确的地质调查工作，因此我们国家的矿藏情况，有很多至今还不清楚；即使是过去已经知道的一点资料，也是极不准确和极不完全的。中华人民共和国成立以后，人民政府努力加强了地质工作。三年来，地质工作人员和钻探机都增加了很多，许多具有近代化探矿设备的物理探矿队等也开始组成了。但是，比之我国经济建设计划的要求，目前我国的地质工作还远远落后于国家经济建设的需要。这是急迫需要加以改变的。
    我国地质工作的落后状况主要表现在两方面：一方面是地质工作力量薄弱，数量少，技术低，设备差，不能及时向国家设计部门提供各项建设所需要的地质资料，以致许多设计无法进行，国家建设工作受到影响。例如中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局根据整个国家计划，准备新建和恢复、改建四十处矿井，但是由于这些矿井缺乏足够的地质资料，建设计划大部分被迫推迟。在中央重工业部和其他部门中，也同样有一些工厂、矿山因为没有确切的地质资料而无法进行设计。地质工作落后状况的另一方面表现，是由于地质工作者及其领导人在工作中存在着严重的主观主义和盲目性，忽视地质工作的科学程序（例如不经过地质调查、槽探、物理探矿就进行钻探、坑探；不经过钻探、坑探就进行生产矿井的建设；不做钻探设计就盲目钻探等等），以致地质工作中错误很多。不少建设工程的设计，由于地质资料不正确，造成了许多根本性质的错误；也有不少建设工程不按照地质工作的程序办事，造成了巨大的损失。西安煤矿的一个新斜井工程，因为错误地估计该处有二百五十万吨煤的埋藏量，投资一百四十亿元进行开采，现在发现藏煤很少。中南钢铁公司开掘一个粘土坑，没有做地质调查工作，就在十公里长的地区上作了三十二个斜井，用了很多钱，后来发现粘土藏量很少，造成巨大浪费。某地有一个铅矿，仅在地表上发现了一点“露头”，没有经过物理探矿及钻探，没有进一步了解地质情况，就盲目地进行坑探，掘进到五十公尺中段后，依然见不到矿体，才知道露头原来已呈“尖灭”现象。
    造成地质工作的这种落后状况的原因是很多的。首先是由于我们不少负责工业建设的领导干部缺乏经验，对于地质工作的重要性认识不足。他们没有深刻地认识到要从事工业建设，没有强有力的地质工作，没有精确的资源勘察工作，是一步路也走不动的，甚至连现有的正常生产也将无法继续维持。因为认识不足，他们就没有把地质工作安排在重要的日程上，没有及早地采取有力的措施来加强这个薄弱的环节。有不少部门长期没有建立起和基本建设任务相适应的地质工作机构，没有把现有地质人员的队伍很好地组织起来，并从各方面扩大地质工作的力量，以致地质工作缺乏领导、力量分散。有的部门片面地重视了设计和施工，而忽视了地质工作，不知道地质正是设计和施工的基础，没有正确的地质工作就不可能设计和施工。有的在工作中只是片面地抓紧钻探、供应和财务，对于最主要的地质工作却没有抓紧。他们不知道钻探只是地质的从属工作，只是地质工作的手段，不首先明瞭地质，钻探就必然会迷失方向，产生许多错误。显然的，如果没有把地质工作先做好，基本建设工作就无法前进。
    其次，在我们现有的地质工作人员中，也还存在着不少的缺点，特别是他们中间的各种错误的思想观点还没有得到严格的批判，学习苏联先进经验的努力还非常不够，因而就很难改变目前技术上的落后状态。例如有的地质人员过去长期习惯于脱离实际的学术研究，因此他们今天在实际工作中仍然表现了对于地质工作的目的性认识不清，不了解地质工作的唯一目的就是为了取得工业资源。他们在工作中往往离开了这个目的，以致花费了很多时间和资金，结果却毫无用处。在许多地质工作部门中，还没有建立起经常检查工作和总结工作的制度，隐伏在工作中的若干错误不能及时被发现，也就不能由此总结经验，来提高大家的工作水平。近年来，各工业部门曾从生产部门和学校、训练班里补充了不少新的地质工作人员，这是一批极其可贵的力量，这批新血液的输入，大大地扩展了地质队伍。他们一般的是热情高，实际经验少，技术水平低，因此结合实际工作组织他们进行各种学习和锻炼，提高他们的技术水平，是一项有重大意义的工作。但不少地质部门结合实际工作对他们进行有计划的培养教育做得不够，结果使得这批新生力量不能迅速成长，工作效率仍然不能提高。以上这些，无疑都妨碍了现有地质人员潜在力量的发挥。
    加强对地质工作的领导，现在应该被摆到负责工业建设的各部门领导者最重要的日程上来了。有些部门的领导干部现在已认识了这个问题，并已积极加强对这一工作的领导，这是完全必要的。为了迅速有效地克服目前地质工作上的落后状况，各领导部门在加强组织建设、加强思想领导的同时，还必须抓紧对地质部门具体的业务领导。根据以往的许多教训，业务方面主要的要抓紧如下的几个问题：第一，地质工作一般的应依照地质调查探勘程序来进行，即对一个矿区的调查，一般的应该第一步进行矿区总的地质调查（找矿），并作出详查计划；第二步进行必要的矿区详查（包括槽探、物理探矿及必要的钻探），制作矿区详细的地质地形图，并作出探矿设计；第三步是矿区精查，进行钻探和坑探，并作出地质结论。只有经过以上的三个步骤之后，才能进行矿山设计，才能进行矿井建设。过去没有按照必要的地质探勘程序进行探勘的矿山，今后应逐步地、有计划地补作矿区的详细地质地形图，以求对该矿区的地质状况有一全盘了解。第二，认真作好探矿设计。探矿设计是否正确，将决定钻探和坑探的结果是否能寻得大量矿量。因此今后凡是进行大量钻探和坑探时，必须有探矿设计，这些设计并要经领导上和专家的审查批准。第三，提高钻探、坑探的质量。地质工作人员应与钻探工作人员密切配合，使钻探工作符合于地质工作要求。钻探（包括坑探）必须按探矿设计的要求来进行，不得违反设计规定。要提高岩心回收率，加强岩心管理，认真作好原始记录，减少钻探事故，提高钻探作业的效率。第四，加强取样、化验分析及物理鉴定工作，建立化验机构，使化验能力和整个地质钻探力量平衡起来。第五，经过勘探的矿山都要作出完整的地质结论，不仅要对地质情况作出结论，而且要对它的经济价值作出结论，要对它是否具有工业建设的条件作出结论。今后地质部门在工作中必须贯彻以上这五点，不应该再重复过去的错误。
    我们的地质工作同志这几年来已做了很多工作，给祖国工业化的伟大事业作了可贵的贡献。但是为了适应发展着的我国工业建设的需要，地质工作还必须有一个重大的转变和提高。这是一个光荣而伟大的任务，全体地质工作者们应该勇敢地把它担当起来。
