Xinhua News Agency, August 9th dispatch from Vienna: The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Executive Bureau meeting was held in Vienna from the 3rd to the 7th of August. Attending the meeting were WFTU Executive Bureau members, members of the Preparatory Committee for the Third WFTU Congress, and representatives from WFTU industrial departments. The agenda of the meeting was the preparatory work for the Third WFTU Congress.

At the meeting, Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the WFTU, delivered a report on the international situation since the last meeting of the WFTU Executive Bureau in April. He pointed out that the characteristic of the current international situation is that the working people of all capitalist and colonial countries have united more closely, and they are striving to stop the current divisions in order to successfully defend economic and social rights, defend trade unions and democratic freedoms, and defend national independence and peace. Saillant also said that another characteristic of the international situation is that the broad masses of people have a greater hope to resolve international issues in a spirit of consultation, and hope that the cause of peace will be victorious. Saillant also pointed out the great contribution of the WFTU in the struggle to achieve the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Kazakov, Secretary of the WFTU, reported on the organization and preparatory work for the Third WFTU Congress. He said that the WFTU leading bodies suggested that WFTU affiliated organizations should pay attention to strengthening the united action of the working people in the movement to prepare for the Third WFTU Congress. He pointed out that the Third WFTU Congress will be very broadly representative. All trade union organizations, whether or not they participate in the WFTU, can participate in this congress.

Lombardo Toledano, Chairman of the Latin American Labor Federation, spoke during the discussion. He emphasized the attention of the Latin American working people to the upcoming Third WFTU Congress. He said that many Latin American countries have organized national preparatory committees. These committees, as well as trade unions in various industries, district and local trade union branches, are organizing meetings to discuss the agenda of the congress and elect their representatives to participate in the congress. At these meetings, workers will put forward social and economic demands aimed at improving living standards.

Diallo (Sudan), Vice President of the WFTU, said in his speech that trade union organizations in many African colonies are raising funds for the travel expenses of their delegations. African workers are linking the preparation work for the congress with their struggle to meet their immediate demands, to win national independence, and to consolidate world peace.

The following also spoke during the discussion: Wijaya Sastra (Indonesia), Monmousseau (France), MacWhinnie (United Kingdom), Liu Changsheng (China), Saarinen (Finland), Avila (Cuba), and Thornton (Australia).

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, August 10th dispatch: The Executive Bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions adopted a letter to the working people of the world, calling for support for the World Movement for Negotiation initiated by the World Peace Council. The text is as follows:

To the working men and women of all countries! The Executive Bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, held in Vienna from August 3rd to 7th, 1953, studied the important resolutions passed by the World Peace Council meeting in Budapest in June 1953.

The Executive Bureau declares that the World Federation of Trade Unions fully supports these resolutions. The Executive Bureau calls on trade union organizations in all countries, and on all working people, to actively participate in the World Movement for Negotiation initiated by the World Peace Council and the movement for peaceful settlement of international disputes.

The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on trade union organizations in all countries to step up their activities to ease international tensions, and to ensure that the spirit of consultation can overcome the policy of force advocated by those who intend to make huge profits from economic militarization and the arms race.

The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on trade union organizations in all countries to carry out a movement for the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

Trade union organizations in all countries should uphold the idea of consultation and promote economic and cultural exchanges between countries with different systems. If trade union organizations in all countries can organize and carry out a movement for economic and cultural exchanges on an equal basis and without discrimination, then their activities to defend the cause of world peace will have more practical content, and this is an activity that is closely related to the daily work of trade union organizations in all countries for the economic and social interests of the working people. As long as the people of all countries take persistent action, they will be able to achieve a solution to problems through consultation in an atmosphere of harmony and peace.

The organizations of the working people must inspire the people to take such action, instill in them confidence in victory, call on people to be vigilant against the enemies of peace and international harmony, and at the same time, in this worldwide peace movement, they must unite millions upon millions of working people regardless of their beliefs, faiths, race, or nationality.

    世界各国的劳动男女们！一九五三年八月三日至七日在维也纳举行的世界工会联合会执行局会议，研究了一九五三年六月世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议所通过的重要决议。
    执行局宣称：世界工会联合会完全支持这些决议。执行局号召各国工会组织，号召全体劳动人民积极参加世界和平理事会发起的世界争取协商运动以及争取和平解决国际争端的运动。
    世界工会联合会号召各国工会组织加紧进行活动，以使国际紧张局势得到缓和，使协商精神能够战胜那些打算从经济军事化和军备竞赛中谋取巨额利润的人们所鼓吹的武力政策。
    世界工会联合会号召各国工会组织进行和平解决国际争端的运动。
    各国工会组织要拥护协商思想，并促进各个不同制度国家间的经济和文化交流。各国工会组织如能组织和进行在平等的基础上的、没有歧视的经济与文化交流的运动，那末它们保卫世界和平事业的活动就会有更实际的内容，而这是一个和各国工会组织为劳动人民的经济与社会利益而进行的日常工作有密切联系的活动。只要各国人民采取坚持不渝的行动，他们就能取得和谐与和平的气氛中用协商办法解决问题。
    劳动人民的组织必须鼓舞人民采取这种行动，使他们具有对胜利的信心，号召人们对和平与各国和谐的敌人提高警惕，同时在这个世界范围的和平运动中，必须不分信念、信仰、种族或国籍的区别，而把千千万万的劳动人民团结起来。
