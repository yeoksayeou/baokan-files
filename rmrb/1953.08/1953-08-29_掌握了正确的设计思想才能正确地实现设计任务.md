    Only by Mastering Correct Design Ideology Can We Correctly Implement Design Tasks
    Li Li, Deputy Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Black Metallurgical Design Company
    Editor's Note: The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry convened a meeting of design cadres from July 28th to 31st, at which Minister Wang Heshou delivered a report on design ideology. After the meeting, the various design units under the Ministry of Heavy Industry successively launched study movements. This article is Li Li, Deputy Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Black Metallurgical Design Company, in his understanding of design ideology during the study. It is published here for the reference of other comrades working in the design departments.
    
    Having participated in the design cadre meeting convened by the Ministry of Heavy Industry, (Note: This meeting was convened from July 28th to 31st, at which Wang Heshou, Minister of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, delivered a report on design ideology.) I clarified many issues.
    
    First of all, I recognized the importance and purpose of design work in the national construction cause. Minister Wang clearly pointed out at the meeting: Design work bears an important responsibility in promoting China's industrialization and gradually transitioning to socialist society. Therefore, all guiding principles and specific policies in this historical period should become the guiding principles and policies of design work; we cannot do a good job of design work if we do not study and comprehend these principles and policies. At the same time, he used vivid facts and clear principles to point out the differences and boundaries between bourgeois design ideology and socialist design ideology. In this fundamental issue, my understanding was originally very vague, and there were many mistakes in my actual work. In the past, our criticism of errors in design was mostly from a technical standpoint, from the administrative procedures of design, or from specific requirements on minor issues. Even when we sometimes checked according to certain principles, the principles themselves were often isolated, and we did not raise them to the height of socialist design ideology to understand them. Therefore, this kind of criticism often could not convince people wholeheartedly, recognize the fundamental nature of errors, and thus consciously avoid repeating them. In the past, criticisms of certain designs were met with conflicting opinions and it was not easy to reach a consensus in understanding, so the persuasiveness was not strong. What was criticized today could be repeated tomorrow; what was criticized in this unit could be repeated in that unit. Ultimately, it was because we did not grasp the key to the problem; the minor issues were criticized, but the major ones were relaxed instead. The failure to discover and propose that errors in design ideology are the root cause of all design errors. The primary reason for this is that we lack a clear and complete understanding of socialist design ideology. In actual work, we did not clearly draw the line between bourgeois and proletarian design ideology, did not distinguish between using the scientific and technological achievements of human history and criticizing bourgeois design ideology, and did not clearly recognize the truth that although technology has no class character, its application in design must be subject to the control of a certain guiding ideology.
    
    Design is a comprehensive product of politics, economics, and technology, and the combination of politics, economics, and technology is the fundamental principle of design work. However, how to combine these three has been a problem that we have not solved for a long time. In the past, we regarded design as the mutual combination of various technologies, and some even regarded design as a technical patchwork. As for how technology is combined with politics and economics, the most common understanding is to draft a plan task book before the design, stipulating the political and economic goals of the design, or that the design has a certain political and economic effect after it has been constructed; it is mistakenly believed that this combination is outside the design process, rather than within the design process. Therefore, this combination is just an empty combination, which in reality cancels out the combination. In essence, we did not understand how to make the design more in line with the political tasks stipulated by the Party and the government for a certain period; the economic goals of the design and the principles of economic accounting are often confused with the narrow, vulgar, and bourgeois view of purely personal profit, believing that there is no strict distinction between us and the bourgeoisie in this regard. Minister Wang's explanation in this regard corrected these harmful views of ours. I now realize that the realization of the great political tasks and the concretization of our various specific policies and guiding ideologies, the socialist economic tasks and the realization of the principles of economic accounting, are the main topics that technology must solve in the design process. In actual work, we can often see or hear hesitation and errors in solving technical problems, among which a part is due to our low technical level and temporarily unable to solve them, but many are caused by insufficient understanding of the political and economic tasks of the design. The more important a design is, the greater its role in the national economy, the more departments it involves, and the wider its impact, the more it needs the guidance of political and economic principles, and the more it needs to examine various issues in the design from a political and economic perspective. A design that is divorced from the political and economic tasks entrusted by the Party and the state must be a design full of errors. Conversely, only after fully, comprehensively, and correctly understanding the tasks that the design should embody in terms of politics and economics can we correctly handle various technical problems in the design. Therefore, if we want to correctly solve the problem of combining politics, economics, and technology in design, in addition to mastering technology, especially advanced Soviet technology, the most important thing is to start with comparing the political and economic value of various technical solutions. As Minister Wang pointed out, under the guidance of bourgeois ideology, technology is only a tool for profit. Under different historical conditions, the bourgeoisie can adopt advanced technology, or it can abandon advanced technology. On the other hand, in order to conceal its ulterior design intentions, the bourgeoisie tries its best to hide the ideological issues contained in the design. This distorted propaganda has blurred the understanding of many people. In the past, we did not have enough understanding and estimation of this point in our actual work, so it was impossible to correctly solve the problem of combining politics, economics, and technology.
    
    The design cadre meeting convened by the Ministry of Heavy Industry not only made us take a step forward ideologically, but also pointed out specific methods for establishing advanced socialist design ideology and criticizing incorrect bourgeois design ideology: on the one hand, we must oppose the impetuous tendency and crude methods of solving ideological problems: the object of criticism should be the work, not the person concerned; the method of criticism should be to summarize experience, so that the study of technology and the criticism of bourgeois ideology are combined. On the other hand, we must prevent the tendency of mechanically copying certain clauses without proceeding from reality. Design workers should, under the leadership of the Party and superiors, combine with the actual situation and complete the design tasks as quickly and correctly as possible; actively create design conditions, prevent the phenomenon of self-flow and waiting in work; fight against all irresponsible phenomena, and strictly distinguish between irresponsible phenomena in work and errors caused by lack of experience and low ideological level; unremittingly promote criticism and self-criticism, and link them with the summary of work.
    
    The instructions of the Ministry of Heavy Industry clarified that we must oppose the erroneous bourgeois design ideology in the design department, establish the advanced socialist design ideology, pointed out the methods and paths for carrying out reforms, and clarified the direction and content of criticism and self-criticism. In essence, it is to improve the quality of our ideological struggle and enrich the content of ideological struggle. Therefore, strengthening ideological education is currently the key to doing a good job of design work.
    
    Like many comrades, I feel that I have taken a great lesson at this meeting. I believe that under the leadership of the Party and superiors, and through the efforts of all design workers, we will be able to correct our mistakes and do a good job of design work.

    掌握了正确的设计思想才能正确地实现设计任务
    鞍钢黑色冶金设计公司副经理  李力
    编者按：中央重工业部在七月二十八日至三十一日召开了设计干部会议，在会上，王鹤寿部长作了关于设计思想问题的报告。会后，重工业部所属的各个设计单位即相继展开了学习运动。这篇文章是鞍钢黑色冶金设计公司副经理李力在学习中对于设计思想问题的体会。这里把它发表出来，以供其他在设计部门中工作的同志参考。
    参加了重工业部召开的设计干部会议，（按：此次会议是在七月二十八日至三十一日召开的，会上中央重工业部部长王鹤寿作了关于设计思想问题的报告。）我明确了很多问题。
    首先，我认识了设计工作在国家建设事业中的重要性及其目的性。王部长在大会上明确指出：设计工作在促进我国工业化和逐渐过渡到社会主义社会的任务中负有重要责任，因此在这一历史时期的一切指导原则和具体方针政策，就应当成为设计工作的指导原则和政策；我们不学习与领会这些原则和政策，就不能做好设计工作。同时，他用生动的事实和明确的原则指出了资产阶级设计思想和社会主义设计思想的区别和界限。在这个根本性的问题上，原来我的认识是很模糊的，在实际工作中也有很多错误。过去我们批判设计中的错误，多是从技术上、设计的行政程序上或从枝枝节节的具体要求上去批判，即使有时也根据某些原则去检查，但原则本身往往是孤立的，而且没有把它们提高到社会主义设计思想的高度来认识。因此，这种批判往往不能使人心悦诚服，认识错误的根本性质，从而自觉地避免重犯。过去对某些设计的批判，众意纷纭，认识上不易取得一致，很难做出结论，因而说服力不强。今天批判了的，明天又可以再犯；这个单位批判了的，那个单位又可以再犯。归根结蒂，是我们没有抓住问题的关键；次要的批判了，主要的反而放松了，没有发现并提出设计思想的错误是一切设计错误的总根源。所以这样，首先是由于我们对社会主义的设计思想缺乏明确而完整的认识。在实际工作中，没有划清资产阶级与无产阶级设计思想的界限，没有把使用人类历史上的科学技术成就与批判资产阶级设计思想的界限分清，没有明确地认识到虽然技术没有阶级性，但它在设计中的运用则必须受一定的指导思想的支配这一真理。
    设计是政治、经济、技术三方面的综合产物，政治、经济、技术相结合是设计工作的根本原则。但是这三者如何结合，则是我们长时期以来所没有解决的问题。过去，我们把设计当作各种技术间的相互结合，有的人甚至把设计当作技术上的拼凑。至于技术如何与政治、经济相结合，最普遍的认识是设计之前起草计划任务书，规定设计的政治与经济目的，或设计既经施工之后，具有一定的政治和经济效用；错误地认为这种结合是在设计的过程之外，而不是在设计的过程之中。因此，这种结合只是空洞的结合，实际上是取消了结合。从实质上讲，我们没有懂得如何使设计更加符合党及政府所规定的一定时期的政治任务；对设计的经济目的和经济核算原则，往往是把它和狭隘的庸俗的资产阶级的单纯个人利润观点混为一谈，认为在这方面我们和资产阶级没有什么严格的区别。王部长在这一方面的说明，纠正了我们这些有害的看法。我现在认识到伟大的政治任务和我们各种具体的政策、指导思想的具体化，社会主义经济任务和经济核算原则的实现，就是技术在设计过程中所要解决的主要课题。在实际工作中，我们常常可以看到或听到在解决技术问题上的踌躇和错误，其中除了一部分是由于我们技术水平低下，暂时还无法解决外，很多是由于对于设计的政治、经济任务理解不足而引起的。一件重要的设计，在国民经济中所起的作用愈大，牵涉的部门愈多，影响的范围愈广，它就愈需要政治和经济原则的指导，愈需要从政治与经济角度去考察设计中的各个问题。脱离了党和国家所赋予的政治和经济任务所做的设计，一定是错误百出的设计。反之，只有充分地、全面地、正确地了解了设计在政治、经济方面应该体现的任务之后，才能在设计中正确地处理各种技术问题。所以，在设计中想要正确地解决政治、经济、技术相结合的问题，除了应当掌握技术、特别是苏联先进的技术之外，最重要的是从比较各种技术方案在政治上经济上的价值着手。正像王部长所指出的，在资产阶级思想指导之下，技术只是利润的工具而已。在不同的历史条件下，资产阶级可以采用先进的技术，也可以摈弃先进技术。在另一方面，资产阶级为了掩饰其不可告人的设计意图，所以尽量隐讳设计中所包含的思想问题。这种歪曲的宣传，模糊了很多人的认识。过去我们在实际工作中对这一点认识与估计不足，因此就不可能正确地解决政治、经济、技术相结合的问题。
    重工业部召开的设计干部会议，不仅使我们在思想上提高了一步，而且对树立先进的社会主义设计思想与批判不正确的资产阶级设计思想指出了具体办法：一方面必须反对解决思想问题的急躁倾向和粗暴做法：批判的对象应当是工作，而不是当事者本人；批判的方法应当是总结经验，使学习技术与批判资产阶级的思想相结合。另一方面必须防止不从实际出发、机械地搬套某些条文的偏向。设计工作人员应当在党和上级的领导下，结合实际情况尽可能迅速地正确地完成设计任务；积极创造设计条件，防止工作中的自流等待现象；与一切不负责任的现象作斗争，把工作中的不负责任现象和由于经验不足、思想水平不高所引起的错误严格地区别开来；坚持不懈地提倡批评与自我批评，并与总结工作联系起来。
    重工业部的指示，使我们明确了必须在设计部门反对错误的资产阶级设计思想，树立先进的社会主义设计思想，指出了进行兴革的方法和道路，明确了批评与自我批评的方向和内容。从实质上讲，是提高了我们思想斗争的质量，丰富了思想斗争的内容。因此，加强思想教育是目前我们做好设计工作的关键。
    我和许多同志一样，感到在这次会议上上了一堂大课。相信在党和上级的领导下，经过全体设计工作人员的努力，我们能够改正错误，做好设计工作。
