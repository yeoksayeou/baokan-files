    An Indestructible Bastion of Peace
    Chen Bojian
    (I)
    The warring parties in the Korean War have ceased hostilities and withdrawn two kilometers each along a winding line from northeast to southwest, which is the finally determined military demarcation line. It crosses the 38th parallel and lies in the area north and south of the 38th parallel. The final determination of this line as the military demarcation line is very significant. It means that the war of aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, launched by the enemy from the 38th parallel, has lasted for three years, one month, and two days, costing more than a million lives and spending more than 20 billion US dollars, and finally it has been stopped at its starting point.
    If one observes the military demarcation line from the air, one will find that everywhere along this line and on both sides of it, there are traces of fierce fighting. Villages and trees in most areas have been destroyed by artillery fire, and only tenacious weeds can quickly grow in the gaps between two shell explosions. The military demarcation line passes through many battlefields that have seen bloody fighting. On "Heartbreak Ridge" on the eastern front, the Americans suffered more than 900 casualties in a single day on October 9, 1951. Over the course of more than a month, they lost countless lives here, so they gave this mountain the name "Heartbreak Ridge." Those who had been to Shangganling before can no longer recognize it now. It has been changed so much that not only have the trees long been destroyed, but even the huge rocks have been blasted into sand, mixed with countless fragments of steel, shattered gun barrels, and enemy corpses. Now, the elevation lines on military maps need to be revised, because many small hills here have been leveled, and the elevation in some places is six meters lower than before. On the western front, names like "Old Baldy" and "Red Hillock" easily evoke associations. These places were originally fertile earthen hills with lush vegetation; but in the long war, repeated explosions of artillery shells have turned up red new soil from several meters underground, and no grass or trees can grow for a while. …
    Supporting this line, making it an impregnable defense line, is our army's consolidated depth defense and powerful equipment. Our army's tunnel fortifications have surpassed any historically strong defensive lines—such as the Maginot Line, the Mannerheim Line, the Siegfried Line, etc. This is a true underground Great Wall. This kind of underground Great Wall, coupled with powerful and intense firepower, renders any artillery fire and bombs of the U.S. imperialism powerless.
    (II)
    The military demarcation line clearly reflects the military reality of the Korean battlefield, which is that due to the rapid growth in strength of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, the U.S. side can only barely maintain a line that they are dissatisfied with and unwilling to acknowledge.
    It is interesting to review the negotiation process on the issue of the military demarcation line and the two revisions of the military demarcation line.
    Originally, the military demarcation line should not have been a problem, because the basis for the start of the Korean armistice negotiations was the speech by the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, on June 23, 1951, and Malik specifically suggested using the 38th parallel as the military demarcation line. However, after the negotiations began, the U.S. side violated this basis. They neither accepted the 38th parallel nor the actual line of contact between the ground forces of the two sides as the military demarcation line. They demanded that the military demarcation line be drawn between the Yalu River and the actual line of contact between the ground forces of the two sides, that is to say, they demanded that the Korean and Chinese sides retreat more than 12,000 square kilometers from their own positions. In short, they attempted to use blackmail to obtain at the negotiating table what they had been proven unable to obtain on the battlefield. Not only that, but they also used military actions on the battlefield to support blackmail in the negotiations. Between May and October 1951, the U.S. side launched the summer and autumn offensives. But the results proved that the military offensives launched with their full "air and sea superiority," in addition to obtaining painful memories such as "Heartbreak Ridge," could not cause any significant and noteworthy changes in the actual line of contact between the two sides. Thus, the Americans had to accept the suggestion of using the actual line of contact between the ground forces of the two sides as the military demarcation line, and the first agreement on the military demarcation line was reached on November 27, 1951.
    It is worth pointing out that at that time, the Korean and Chinese sides suggested that the agreement between the two sides be finalized on the map as the final military demarcation line; however, the U.S. side insisted on opposing it, saying that this would form a de facto ceasefire and would eliminate the possibility of changing the military demarcation line. The Korean and Chinese sides agreed with the U.S. side's opinion of adjusting the military demarcation line according to the actual line of contact between the two sides at the time when the armistice agreement was about to be signed. However, the Korean and Chinese negotiators also pointed out that the change in the military demarcation line could certainly be northward, but it could equally well be southward.
    After that, the negotiations dragged on for another year and eight months. During this period, the U.S. side launched several more offensives, attempting to change the position of the military demarcation line. At that time, Joye boasted in the conference room at Panmunjom: "Let the planes and cannons continue to debate!" But the military reality was very harsh. The results of the "debate" by planes and cannons could not provide Joye with any favorable support. The Korean and Chinese soldiers roared in the face of the U.S. side's planes and cannons: "You have no right to speak here!" In that year, an even greater change took place in the military reality of the Korean battlefield: the powerful coastal artillery fire of the Korean and Chinese forces forced those warships that had once unscrupulously approached the coast to carry out close-range firing to flee the coast and sink some of them to the bottom of the sea; the tone of American reports on the air force was not as relaxed as before, and they began to feel uneasy about the continuous expansion of the operational area of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force; on the front lines, the Americans began to "lower their heads." They could no longer look forward to the good old days of sitting on the hillside and drinking with their chests open. They complained about their fate. They thought they were much nobler than moles, but they had to live a mole-like life. On the contrary, the soldiers of the Korean and Chinese forces became more and more heroic and lived more and more comfortably. They deeply felt the righteousness of their cause and firmly believed in the solidity of their positions. They called their positions "Gates of Peace" and resolutely defended peace.
    The military reality on the battlefield—the comprehensive result of the changing balance of military power between the two sides—was manifested in the changes in the military demarcation line. In mid-June of this year, the two sides reached a second agreement on the issue of the military demarcation line. This time, the re-adjustment of the military demarcation line showed that in the eighteen months or so, the U.S. side advanced a total of 5.3 square kilometers northward in five places along the entire 220-kilometer-long front line, while the Korean and Chinese sides advanced 140 square kilometers southward during the same period. Since June, the signing of the armistice agreement has been delayed for more than a month due to the Syngman Rhee group's opposition to the armistice and sabotage of the agreement. During this month or so, the enemy's purpose of moving the front line northward could not be achieved at all; the results of the counterattack by the Korean and Chinese forces pushed the front line southward in eight places along the entire line, a total of 192.6 square kilometers, thus making it impossible not to make a second revision of the military demarcation line. In this way, in the twenty months since November 27, 1951, our army's positions have advanced a total of 332.6 square kilometers southward, while the enemy's army has advanced only 5.3 square kilometers northward.
    This difference in the area of advance is negligible in positional warfare where positions change frequently, but it is a different matter in positional warfare where both sides have strongly fortified depth defenses. There are two extremely obvious contrasting examples: last October, the enemy successively used the forces of several divisions, including the U.S. 7th Division, 25th Division, ROK 2nd Division, and 9th Division, and launched a frantic offensive on the vanguard position of Shangganling, less than four square kilometers in area, on the forward positions of our central line, Mount Wusheng, with the cooperation of the artillery reserve of the U.S. 8th Army and an average of more than 70 sorties of aircraft per day. The U.S. military's intention was to first occupy Shangganling, so that the main position of our Mount Wusheng would be directly exposed to the spearhead of their offensive, thereby threatening our entire central front. However, after a month and a half of fierce fighting, the U.S. and Rhee forces suffered more than 25,000 casualties, but only temporarily occupied one of the two outposts of the 537.7 Height, an outpost south of Shangganling. From July 13 to 18 this year, our army's counterattack against the enemy in the Jincheng area to the south annihilated more than 26,000 enemy soldiers in just six days, advancing nine kilometers and advancing an area of 169.2 square kilometers. According to reports by American news agencies, ROK deputy division commanders, regimental commanders, and U.S. military advisors "went missing" in this battle. Our army's battle report stated that our army captured a large number of enemy ammunition depots, which shows that our army has broken into the enemy's deep defense. This situation of our army being sure to defend firmly and win in attack is the most eloquent proof that the enemy army is becoming weaker and weaker and our army is becoming stronger and stronger on the Korean battlefield.
    (III)
    Now, the war has stopped along such an indestructible front line. The Americans fought for three years, certainly not to stop and return to the original position; although the Americans are unwilling to admit it, people can only conclude that the war of aggression they launched has failed. They have not achieved their aggressive goal of occupying northern Korea and then threatening northeastern China, and they will never be able to achieve this goal in the future. However, the Syngman Rhee group is still clamoring to "go it alone" and to "unify Korea by force." Now, the Korean and Chinese forces have withdrawn from the demilitarized zone, and they are vigilantly monitoring the enemy four kilometers away. If Syngman Rhee dares to violate the armistice agreement, then the blow and lesson he will receive will be heavier and more miserable than what he has received in the past three years.

    坚不可摧的和平阵地
    陈伯坚
    （一）
    朝鲜战争中的敌对双方，已经沿一条从东北向西南的蜿蜒的线停火并各后撤两公里，这就是最后确定的军事分界线，它穿过三八线，位于三八线南北一带。这一条线之最后被确定为军事分界线是很有意义的。它意味着：敌人从三八线发动的侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的战争，历时三年一个月又两天，损兵百余万，花费了二百多亿美元，最后还是在它的起点被停止了。
    如果从空中观察一下军事分界线，便会发现在这条线及其两侧到处显示着曾经激烈争夺的痕迹，大部分地区的村庄和树木都被打光了，只有顽强的野草还能在两次炮弹爆炸的空隙迅速地生长出来。军事分界线经过许多曾经过血战的阵地。在东线的“伤心岭”，美国人在一九五一年十月九日一天中就在这儿死伤了九百多人。前后一个多月，他们在这儿送掉了无数性命，因此他们为这座山取了个名字叫做“伤心岭”。从前曾经到过上甘岭的人，现在对它已经无法辨认了，它被改变得那么厉害，不仅树木早已打光，连巨大的岩石都已被炸成砂子，里面混和着无数钢铁的碎片、炸碎了的枪枝和敌军尸体。现在，军用地图的标高线需要修改了，因为这里许多小山头已被轰平，有的地方的拔海高度比原先低了六公尺。在西线，“老秃山”和“红山包”这些名字很容易引起人们的联想。这些地方原是很肥沃的土山，山上草木茂盛；但是在长期战争中，炮弹的反复爆炸已经从数公尺的地下翻出了红色的新土，一时再也长不出草木了。……
    支持着这一条线使它成为攻不破的防线的，是我军巩固的纵深阵地和强大的装备。我军的坑道阵地已经超过历史上任何坚固设防的阵线——例如马奇诺、曼纳林、齐格非等等。这是真正的地下长城，这样的地下长城，加上强大的盛炽的火力，就使美帝国主义的任何炮火和炸弹都无能为力。
    （二）
    军事分界线清楚地反映了朝鲜战场的军事实际，这就是：由于朝中人民军队的迅速强大，美方仅能勉强维持一条他们所不满意的、不愿承认的战线。
    回顾一下关于军事分界线问题的谈判过程和军事分界线的两度修改是很有意思的。
    本来，军事分界线是不应该成为问题的，因为朝鲜停战谈判得以开始的基础是苏联驻联合国代表马立克在一九五一年六月二十三日的演说，而马立克正是建议以三八线为军事分界线的。但是谈判开始以后，美方却破坏了这个基础。他们既不接受以三八线，也不接受双方地面部队的实际接触线作为军事分界线。他们要求把军事分界线划在鸭绿江和双方地面部队的实际接触线之间，就是说：要求朝中方面从自己的阵地后退一万二千多平方公里。总之，他们企图用讹诈的办法在会议桌上取得他们在战场上已被证明得不到的东西。不仅如此，他们还以战场上的军事行动来支持谈判中的讹诈。在一九五一年五月到十月间，美方发动了夏季和秋季攻势。但是结果证明了：挟其全部“海空优势”所发动的军事攻势，除了得到例如“伤心岭”这样痛苦的回忆之外，并不能使双方实际接触线发生稍微重大的、值得称道的变化，于是美国人不得不接受了以双方地面部队的实际接触线为军事分界线的建议，第一次关于军事分界线的协议乃得于一九五一年十一月二十七日达成。
    值得指出的是：当时朝中方面曾建议把双方的协议在地图上确定下来，作为最后的军事分界线；但是美方坚持反对，说是这样就要形成事实上的停火，就取消了改变军事分界线的可能。朝中方面同意了美方在停战协定即将签字时再按双方当时的实际接触线校正军事分界线的意见。但朝中谈判代表同时指出：军事分界线的变化固然可以向北，但也同样可以是向南的。
    此后谈判又拖延了一年又八个月。在这期间美方又发动了多次进攻，企图改变军事分界线的位置。当时，乔埃在板门店的会议室中扬言：“让飞机和大炮去继续辩论吧！”但是军事现实是很冷酷的，飞机和大炮“辩论”的结果一点也不能给乔埃以有利的支持，朝中战士在美方的飞机大炮面前发出了豪语：“这儿没有你们的发言权！”就在这一年，朝鲜战场的军事实际发生了更大的变化：朝中部队强大的海岸炮火迫使那些曾经肆无忌惮地靠近海岸实行抵近射击的军舰逃离海岸，并把其中的一些轰沉海底；美国人关于空军的报道的语调不像以前那么轻松了，开始对中国人民志愿军空军的活动区域的不断扩大感到不安了；在前线，美国人开始“低下头来”，他们再也想望不到大模大样地坐在山坡上，敞着胸怀喝酒的好时光了，他们怨天尤人了，他们自以为比鼹鼠高尚得多，但不得不过起鼹鼠似的生活来了。相反的，朝中部队的战士却越加豪迈，生活越加舒适，他们深感自己事业的正义性，坚信自己阵地的巩固，他们称自己的阵地为“和平大门”，坚决地保卫着和平。
    战场上的军事实际——双方军事力量对比变化的综合结果，就表现于军事分界线的变化。今年六月中旬，双方第二次关于军事分界线问题达成协议。这一次重新校正军事分界线表明：十八个多月中，美方在全长二百二十多公里的战线上，在五个地方共向北推进了五点三平方公里，而朝中方面则在同一时期向南推进了一百四十平方公里。自六月份以来，由于李承晚集团反对停战、破坏协议，使停战协定的签字时间拖延了一个多月。在这一个多月中，敌人企图使战线向北移动的目的一点也不能达到；朝中部队反击战的结果却又在全线八个地方把战线向南推进了共达一百九十二点六平方公里，因而使军事分界线不能不做第二次修正。这样，从一九五一年十一月二十七日以来的二十个月中，我军阵地共向南推进三百三十二点六平方公里，敌军则仅向北推进五点三平方公里。
    这种推进面积的差别，在阵地经常变换的阵地战中是微不足道的，但是在双方都有强固设防的纵深阵地的阵地战中则是另外一回事。有两个极明显的对比的例子：去年十月敌人先后动用了美军第七师、第二十五师、李伪军第二师、第九师等几个师的兵力，在美军第八军的炮兵预备总队和平均每天七十多架次飞机的配合下，向我中线五圣山的前卫阵地上甘岭不到四平方公里的地区发动疯狂的进攻。美军的企图是首先攻占上甘岭，使我五圣山主阵地直接暴露于其进攻的矛头之下，进而威胁我整个中部战线。但是经过一个半月的激烈战斗，美李军伤亡二万五千余人，却仅仅暂时占领了我军上甘岭以南两个阵地之一的五三七点七高地的一个前哨阵地。而今年七月十三日至十八日，我军对金城以南地区敌人的反击，则仅仅在六天中即歼敌二万六千多人，前进了九公里，推进面积达一百六十九点二平方公里。据美国通讯社报道，在这次战斗中有李伪军的副师长、团长和美军顾问“失踪”。我军战报说明，这次我军曾缴获敌军大量的弹药库，这就表明我军已突进到敌军的纵深阵地。我军这种守必固、攻必克的情况，就是在朝鲜战场上敌军愈战愈弱而我军则愈战愈强的最雄辩的证明。
    （三）
    现在，战争已经沿着这样一条坚不可摧的战线停止下来。美国人打了三年，当然不是为了回到原来的位置停下来；虽然美国人不愿意承认，但是人们还只能得出结论说：它所发动的侵略战争是失败了，他们没有达到侵占朝鲜北部，进而威胁中国东北的侵略目的，今后他们也永远不能达到这个目的。但是李承晚集团还在叫嚣要“单独干”，要“以武力统一朝鲜”。现在，朝中部队已经撤离非军事区，他们正警惕地监视着对面四公里外的敌人，如果李承晚敢于破坏停战协定，那么他所要得到的打击和教训，将比过去三年中所得到的更重、更惨。
