The Joy of Tibetan People in Qilian Township
—A Record of Qilian Township Herdsmen Before and After Reforming Grazing Habits

Qilian Township, Minle County, Gansu Province, is a Tibetan residential area located at the foot of the Qilian Mountains, surrounded by mountains. It is one hundred li long from east to west and thirty li wide from north to south. Except for a small agricultural area, it is all grassland, covering an area of about 200 square kilometers. The grassland here is vast, the grass quality is excellent, and the people have rich experience in animal husbandry, making it a good place to develop animal husbandry.

In the old society, due to the oppression and trampling of the Tibetan people by the reactionary ruling Chiang Kai-shek-Ma Bufang bandit gang and local tyrants and evil gentry, the animal husbandry of Qilian Township was severely damaged. Evil bullies such as Sun Zhenhe (who has absconded), Ge Rongchun, and Mu Yantian (who has been shot) even colluded with the reactionary bureaucrat Zhang Shengwei to turn nearly 30,000 mu of Huangcaogou (Yellow Grass Gully) into cultivated land, renting it to farmers, and shrinking the pasture. In the summer, the landlords drove their livestock (including draft animals) to trample on the grassland, leaving the Tibetan people's livestock with no feed to eat in the winter. The gradual bankruptcy of animal husbandry directly affected the lives of the Tibetan people. They had no milk to drink, no meat to eat, no horses to ride, and no animal skins to wear. Many Tibetan people had no choice but to painfully abandon animal husbandry and engage in agriculture.

In the three years since liberation, the Party and the People's Government have led the people of Qilian Township to carry out movements to increase and protect livestock, strengthened the prevention and treatment of livestock diseases, expanded grasslands, improved feeding management, and provided loans to help herdsmen solve their difficulties. The animal husbandry of Qilian Township has achieved unprecedented development. Now every household in the township has livestock. For example, Liu Zashi in Changling Village had no horses before liberation, but now he has four. Wang Yinghuai had no livestock before liberation, but now he has one horse, eight cattle, and more than thirty sheep. Before liberation, the township had a total of 143 horses, 231 cattle, 21 mules, 85 donkeys, and 1,820 sheep. In the three years since liberation, the township's livestock has increased to 385 cattle, 180 horses, 32 mules, 99 donkeys, and 3,618 sheep. The increase in livestock has greatly improved the lives of the local Tibetan people.

Qilian Township has such a large grassland, but over the years people have always felt that grazing is extremely crowded, livestock cannot eat good grass, and winter grass is also scarce. After careful investigation and research, the local Party and government found the main reasons for this phenomenon: old habits that hinder the development of animal husbandry left over from the old society are still continuing. The most serious problem is that some herdsmen抢放 (qiang fang - rush to graze first, often aggressively), and乱放 (luan fang - graze in a disorderly manner), trampling on the grassland; herdsmen have no organization, graze in a dispersed manner, do not go to the green mountains in summer, and stubbornly guard the plains in winter, only knowing how to graze but not how to cultivate grass; especially some who揽放 (lan fang - contract graze) draft animals, only want to earn wages, driving hundreds of cattle around, causing even greater damage to the grassland. The herdsmen's idea of "Yellow cattle go up the mountain, left to heaven" (黄牛上山，交给老天 - meaning abandoning management) also hinders the development of animal husbandry. Livestock grazing should be early in the morning and collected in the evening; but some herdsmen do not collect them at night, do not care for several days, and do not even know that the livestock have died for more than ten days. Therefore, many livestock die from falling off the mountains or being eaten by wolves. For example, this year, a shepherd from the Ji family in Huangcaogou did not bring the sheep back into the pen at night, leaving some on the mountain. The next day, when they went to look for them, all sixty-eight sheep were bitten to death or injured by wolves. Usually, without management, once it is cloudy and rainy, herdsmen hurriedly drive large numbers of livestock down the mountain, often trampling on crops. At the same time, grazing perennial livestock with temporary livestock, and agricultural livestock with animal husbandry livestock, also affects the health of the livestock. These habits, which herdsmen are accustomed to, are not improved, seriously hindering the development of animal husbandry.

The Minle County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Minle County People's Government, in light of the local reality, have led the Tibetan people through three years of efforts, especially through nearly one year of efforts, have fundamentally changed the above situation. The grassland has been reborn, and livestock are grazing in an organized and planned manner according to the four seasons, and the development of animal husbandry has a bright future. Wang Zhengxing, Secretary of the Minle County Committee of the Communist Party of China, attaches great importance to the development of Tibetan animal husbandry. He pays attention to grasping various important situations on the grassland and has adopted effective measures. He has instructed Huang Zhongbu, the head of Qilian Township, several times to take full responsibility for doing a good job in grassland work. Last winter, the township closed off most of the Huangcaogou that was forcibly opened by the Kuomintang in the past, expanding the grassland (with the consent of local farmers and appropriate arrangements). This spring, the county sent cadres to the grassland again, and based on the local reality and absorbing the opinions of the masses, divided the area according to the principle of rotational grazing in the four seasons. In early July, a working group was sent to rectify this work and implement new animal husbandry methods. After the working group arrived, in view of the shortcomings in past grazing, they adopted the method of consultation between Tibetan and Han herdsmen, elected grassland management committees, established grassland management committees, adjusted grazing, and established many animal husbandry groups in each region to specifically guide the grazing work of herdsmen. Each group has formulated animal husbandry covenants to ensure the realization of the four-season rotational grazing system. The grassland was divided into regions and proper care was taken for seedling protection. The area near the southern mountains was designated as a summer and autumn grazing area, because it is hot in summer and livestock can graze here to avoid the heat; the plains near the agricultural area were designated as a winter and spring grazing area, because snow easily melts in these areas in winter, and they are very safe, and the climate is relatively mild, which does not affect the health of the livestock. At the same time, grazing locations were also allocated for perennial and temporary livestock to avoid mixing and affecting the health of the livestock. After this zoning, the masses were very satisfied. Now, the winter grass areas that have been closed off have been cut off from livestock, and the green grass is growing very luxuriantly. The idea of "Yellow cattle go up the mountain, left to heaven" has also been subjected to mass criticism. The leadership put forward the slogan "People follow livestock" and organized herdsmen to discuss it. The herdsmen turned this slogan into specific clauses and incorporated them into the covenant, such as "Get up early and sleep late, people follow the livestock, go to the steep places and block them towards the flat places, and completely collect them into the pens at night," "Block the livestock tightly, do not invade winter grass, and do not harm crops." Now the herdsmen go out early and return late, following the livestock to graze, in an orderly manner. On the vast grasslands, teams of cattle and sheep freely eat the green grass, and each one grows fat.

The cattle and sheep in Minle County were originally mostly thin and small, produced little milk, and yielded little wool, so the benefits were not great. This is due to poor breed and poor feeding. In order to eradicate these weaknesses, the Minle County Sheep Promotion Station selected 1,500 sheep to crossbreed with Lanha sheep (a superior breed) to improve the breed. In addition, they also explained to the herdsmen the methods of cultivating grasslands and improving feeding. The herdsmen personally experienced the benefits of managing livestock with scientific methods, and their enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved. Now they are working hard to further develop the livestock industry.

    祁连乡藏民的喜悦
    ——记祁连乡牧民改革放牧习惯前后
    绿野
    甘肃省民乐县祁连乡是藏民居住区，位于祁连山下，在万山环抱之中。东西长一百华里，南北宽三十华里。除少部分农业地区外，都是草原，面积约二百多平方公里。这里草原广阔，草质优良，人民富有牧畜经验，是发展畜牧业的好地方。
    在旧社会，由于反动统治蒋马匪帮、土豪劣绅对藏族人民的压迫和蹂躏，祁连乡的畜牧业遭到严重摧残；恶霸孙振和（已潜逃）、葛荣春、穆燕天（已被枪毙）等更勾结反动官僚张声威把近三万亩的黄草沟开成耕地，租给农民，缩小了牧场。夏天，地主们把牲口（包括耕畜）赶来，糟踏草原，使藏民的牲畜在冬天无饲料可食。畜牧业的日渐破产，直接影响了藏民的生活。他们没奶吃，缺肉吃，没有马可骑，也没有兽皮可穿了。许多藏民不得不忍痛抛弃了畜牧业从事农业。
    解放三年多来，党和人民政府领导祁连乡人民开展了增畜保畜运动，加强了牲畜疾病的防御和治疗，扩大了草原，改善了饲养管理，并贷款帮助牧民解决困难。祁连乡畜牧事业得到空前的发展。现在全乡每户都有牲口。如长岭村刘砟时解放前没有马，现在已有四匹。王应槐解放前没有牲口，现在已有马一匹、牛八头、羊三十余只。解放前全乡共有马一百四十三匹、牛二百三十一头、骡二十一匹、驴八十五头、羊一千八百二十只，解放三年多来，全乡牲畜已增加到牛三百八十五头、马一百八十匹、骡三十二匹、驴九十九头、羊三千六百一十八只。牲畜的增加，使当地藏族人民的生活得到很大的改善。
    祁连乡草原这样大，但历年来人们总觉得放牧异常拥挤，牲畜吃不好草，冬草也缺少。当地党和人民政府经过细致调查研究之后，找出了发生这种现象的主要原因：从旧社会遗留下来的妨碍畜牧业发展的旧习惯，仍然继续着，最严重的是有的牧民抢放、乱放，糟踏草原；牧民没有组织，分散牧放，夏天不上青山，冬天死守平滩，只知放牧，不知育草；特别是一些揽放耕畜的，只图赚工钱，撵上几百头牛到处乱放，给草原的破坏更大。牧民的“黄牛上山，交给老天”的放弃管理的思想，也妨害了牧畜业的发展。放牧牲畜应当是早起放、晚上收；但有的牧民晚上不收，几天不管，甚至牲口死了十几天还不知道。因此牲口因滚山摔死摔伤或被狼吃的很多。如今年黄草沟姬家的一个牧羊的，晚上没有把羊收进圈，一部分遗在山上，第二天去找，六十八只羊全被狼咬死咬伤。平时不加管理，一到天阴下雨，牧民把大批牲畜匆忙赶下山来，常常糟踏庄稼。同时，常年牲口、临时牲口混在一起，农业牲口、畜牧牲口混在一起放牧，也影响牲畜的健康。这些习惯，牧民习以为常，不加改善，严重妨害了畜牧事业的发展。
    中共民乐县委会和民乐县人民政府针对当地实际情况，领导着藏族人民经过三年的努力，特别是经过近一年的努力，已根本改变了上述情况。草原新生了，牲畜有组织有计划地按四季轮流放牧着，畜牧事业的发展有了光辉的前程。中共民乐县委书记王政行对藏民畜牧事业的发展十分重视。他注意掌握草原的各种重要情况，采取了有效的措施。他曾几次责成祁连乡乡长黄仲布负全责搞好草原工作。该乡去冬把过去国民党强开的黄草沟大部封育，扩大了草原（取得当地农民同意，并给以适当安排）。今年春天县里又派了干部到草原上，依据当地实际情况，吸收了群众意见，按四季轮放的原则进行了区划。七月初旬又派工作组对这一工作加以整顿，实行了新的牧畜方法。工作组到达后，针对已往放牧中的缺点，采用藏汉牧民协商的办法，选举了草原管理委员，成立了草原管理委员会，调剂放牧，并按地区成立了许多畜牧小组，具体领导牧民的放牧工作。各小组订立了畜牧公约，以保证四季轮放制度的实现。草原进行了区划并适当地照顾了保苗工作。靠近南山的地方，划为夏秋草区，因为夏天天热，牲口在这里放牧好避暑；靠近农业区的平滩地，划为冬春草区，因为这些地方冬天下了雪容易消融，又很安全，气候也比较温和，不影响牲畜的健康。同时又给常年和临时性的牲口，划分了牧放地点，以免混在一起，影响牲畜健康。这样划区以后，群众都很满意。现在封育的冬草地区，断了牲口，绿茸茸的草长得非常茂盛。“黄牛上山，交给老天”的思想也受到群众性的批判，领导上提出“人跟牲畜走”的口号，并组织牧民作了讨论。牧民把这个口号化作具体条文订进了公约，如“早起迟睡，人跟牲口走，到陡处往平处挡，晚上完全收到圈里”，“挡紧牲口，不侵犯冬草，不残害庄稼”。现在牧民早出晚归，跟上牲口放牧，井然有序。广大的草原上，一队队的牛羊，自由地吃着青草，一个个都长得肥肥胖胖。
    民乐县的牛羊本来大都瘦小，挤奶不多，剪毛也少，收益不很大。这是品种不好、饲养不良的缘故。为了根除这些弱点，民乐县绵羊推广站挑选了一千五百只羊与兰哈羊（优良品种）进行杂交配种，以改良品种。另外，又给牧民讲解培育草原、改善饲养的方法。牧民亲身体会到用科学方法管理牲畜的好处，生产积极性大大提高，现在正为进一步发展牧畜事业而努力。
