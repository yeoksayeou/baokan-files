Why Has the German Question Been Delayed for Eight Years?
		Tan Wenrui

Eight years have passed since the end of the war, but a peace treaty with Germany has not yet been concluded, and Germany remains divided and occupied. What is the reason for this?

Regarding the principles for the post-war disposition of Germany, the Potsdam Agreement signed by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom in 1945, and later joined by France, clearly stipulated: "German militarism and Nazism shall be eradicated, and the Allies shall unanimously agree on other necessary measures to ensure that Germany never again threatens its neighbors or global peace. The Allies have no intention of destroying or enslaving the German people, but rather desire to give the German people the opportunity to build a new life on a democratic and peaceful basis." In other words, the goal was to make Germany a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving country. Regarding the steps to resolve the German question, the Potsdam Agreement also stipulated: The Council of Foreign Ministers was established "to be responsible for preparing a peace settlement for Germany, which shall be accepted by a German government meeting the required goals when it is established." Obviously, if the four powers that signed the Potsdam Agreement had truly fulfilled the solemn obligations of this international agreement and followed the principles and steps it stipulated to resolve the German question, then a peace treaty with Germany could have been concluded long ago, and Germany could have been reunified long ago.

The Soviet Union has consistently and faithfully implemented the resolutions of the Potsdam Conference. When the work of concluding peace treaties with Germany's former five allies—Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland—was largely completed, the Soviet Union proposed that preparations should begin for a peace treaty with Germany and that work should begin on organizing an all-German government in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. However, at the Foreign Ministers' Conferences in Moscow and London in 1947, the United States, Britain, and France vigorously obstructed discussions of the Soviet proposals for the establishment of an all-German democratic government and the convening of a peace conference to discuss a draft peace treaty with Germany, rendering the Foreign Ministers' Conferences fruitless. Later, the Western countries simply adopted the crude tactic of boycotting the holding of Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conferences. It was only due to the efforts of the Soviet Union that they agreed in May 1949 to resume the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Paris to discuss the German question. However, at this conference, the Western countries still adopted a negative stance towards the Soviet Union's proposals on fundamental German issues, and therefore no significant agreement could be reached.

Simultaneous with delaying the resolution of the German question, the United States and its British and French partners began to implement a policy of reviving German militarism and dividing Germany. The mouthpiece of the American ruling clique, the "New York Herald Tribune," bluntly stated in a commentary on the London Foreign Ministers' Conference on December 20, 1947: "We have reached the end of the road. The era of Yalta is over... The division of Germany allows us to freely integrate West Germany into the Western system."

From 1947 onwards, the United States, Britain, and France continuously adopted unilateral measures to divide Germany, in violation of the Potsdam Agreement. In August 1947, the US and Britain incorporated their merged occupation zones into the "Marshall Plan." In June 1948, the US, Britain, and France unilaterally implemented currency reform in West Germany. In April 1949, the US and Britain further unilaterally announced the West German Occupation Statute. By September of the same year, the divisive activities of the Western countries had reached their peak with the creation of the Bonn "state". The US, Britain, and France supported a small group of revanchists headed by Adenauer to form the Bonn puppet regime, deepening the division of Germany.

The establishment of the Bonn "state" made the enslavement and the threat of war faced by the German people even more serious. The German people understood that only by taking the destiny of the country into their own hands could they avoid national disaster. The democratic forces of Germany, led by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, were determined to take on the cause of building a unified, independent, democratic, and peaceful Germany. The German Democratic Republic was proclaimed on October 7, 1949, and thus the German people had a fortress from which to strive for national unity, democracy, and independence. From the day of its founding, the German Democratic Republic has led the German people in persistent and unremitting struggle for national unity and independence. On December 1, 1950, Grotewohl proposed to Adenauer that negotiations begin to establish an all-German constitutional assembly to prepare for the establishment of an all-German provisional government, but this proposal was rejected by the Bonn parliament. The Adenauer regime shamelessly betrayed the interests of the German nation, implementing the US policy of dividing Germany. Nevertheless, the German Democratic Republic continued to work tirelessly to promote understanding between East and West and to restore national unity.

The Soviet Union has consistently supported the German people's desire for unity, independence, democracy, and peace. Therefore, after the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union decided to transfer the administrative powers of the Soviet military government in the German occupation zone to the provisional government of the German Democratic Republic, and declared that "the Soviet government will continue to fully assist in the restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis, and will equally fully assist in the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany."

In 1950, at the suggestion of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and the Eastern European people's democracies held an eight-nation foreign ministers' conference, resolutely opposing the aggressive policies of the Western countries in Germany, and formulated a democratic program for resolving the German question, demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany without delay, the restoration of German unity in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, and stipulating that all foreign occupation forces withdraw from Germany within one year after the conclusion of the treaty. In order to strive for a peaceful solution to the German question, the Soviet Union repeatedly sent notes to the United States, Britain, and France, urging them to immediately negotiate on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the unification of Germany, and put forward concrete proposals for resolving the German question. However, the United States and its British and French partners rejected all practical methods for concluding a peace treaty with Germany and unifying Germany, and intensified the rearmament of West Germany, attempting to drag West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc.

In May 1952, the United States, Britain, and France, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and the people of the world, unilaterally signed the so-called "General Treaty" and the "European Defense Community" treaty with the West German puppet government. The former guaranteed the occupation of West Germany by the troops of the United States, Britain, and France for fifty years and legalized the rearmament of West Germany; the latter stipulated the establishment of the so-called "European Army," with the rebuilt Hitler Wehrmacht as the backbone of this aggressive army. In fact, while carrying out the conspiracy to divide Germany, the Western countries had been gradually accelerating the re-militarization of West Germany. Since 1949, the US, Britain, and France have actively restored West Germany's military potential, accelerating the reconstruction of the West German army commanded by Hitler's generals under the guise of various names such as "labor brigades" and "security forces." By 1950, the average monthly output of West Germany's industry serving military production had reached 120 percent of that in 1936; the "New York Herald Tribune" confirmed in April 1951 that "plans to build a German combat force of about twelve divisions equipped with six hundred aircraft as tactical support are nearing completion," and that "plans for a naval force to defend ports are also ready. Plans to build German forces with armored vehicles and anti-tank guns are also in preparation." In addition, the US, Britain, and France are also greatly increasing the number of occupation troops in West Germany, building military bases, and implementing various military measures to prepare for war, turning West Germany into a bridgehead for launching a new war. The Western countries' actions in creating the Bonn and Paris war treaties, openly arming West Germany, and deepening the division of Germany are clearly contrary to the goal of establishing an independent, peaceful, unified, and democratic Germany.

At that time, the Soviet Union sternly denounced the Western countries' crimes of violating the Potsdam Agreement, and once again stated: "The Soviet government is willing to do its utmost to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and to restore the all-German government." This open and aboveboard attitude of the Soviet Union fully demonstrated its sincerity in seeking a peaceful solution to the German question. However, the Western countries have been trying to evade negotiations to resolve the German question, using the excuse that there is no all-German government yet, refusing to consider a peace treaty with Germany, and entangling the issue in the trivial matter of investigating the conditions for holding free elections in Germany.

Based on the above facts, anyone who dares to see the sunlight and dares to face reality can judge: The reason why the German question has not yet been peacefully resolved, and has become an increasingly serious threat to European and world peace, is entirely the result of the evil policy of the United States and its British and French partners in implementing the division of Germany and further restoring the German war hotbed.

This evil German policy of the United States has inevitably aroused resistance from the people of Germany and Western Europe, and the ruling classes of Western European countries, especially France, are deeply wary of the revival of West German militarism. Precisely for this reason, the US plan to support West Germany, especially the plan to build a "European Army," has suffered great setbacks, and the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty have not yet been ratified by the parliaments of France and other Western European countries.

Since the beginning of this year, the people of the world have been encouraged by the Soviet Union's peace initiatives and have enthusiastically launched a movement demanding the peaceful settlement of international disputes through consultation. After the Korean armistice, the people of the world urgently hope that the major countries concerned will resolve the German question peacefully as soon as possible in order to further ease international tensions. Due to this irresistible pressure from the broad masses of the people, the United States and its British and French partners have had to try to cover up their evil conspiracy of actually adhering to the division of Germany and delaying the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The communiqué issued by the US, British, and French foreign ministers at the meeting in July hypocritically declared: "The three countries are determined to make new efforts to end the division of Germany." On July 15, the three countries separately sent notes to the Soviet government, suggesting that a four-power foreign ministers' conference be held at the end of September to discuss issues related to investigating the conditions for holding free elections in Germany. However, the true purpose of the Western countries was immediately exposed by public opinion in various countries; they actually did not want to resolve the German question, but only wanted to use this to resist a great power conference to broadly discuss international issues, and to support the Adenauer reactionary group on the eve of the West German elections. As the Soviet government's note of August 4 pointed out, the Western countries' notes "have no intention of promoting the resolution of the fundamental issues of Germany," and that "such a proposal will not only fail to promote the unification of Germany and the establishment of an all-German democratic government, but will also maintain the divided situation of Germany between the East and West, and delay the conclusion of a peace treaty as before."

However, the Soviet Union's efforts to strive for a peaceful solution to the German question have not slackened in the slightest. The Soviet government's note of August 4 to the United States, Britain, and France stated that it was still willing to hold a four-power foreign ministers' conference, but suggested that the agenda of the conference should include discussions on restoring German unity and concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and on methods to ease international tensions. On August 15, the Soviet government once again sent notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, suggesting that immediate practical measures be taken to resolve the German question, including convening a peace conference with the participation of all relevant countries within six months to discuss a peace treaty with Germany, as well as organizing an all-German provisional government and holding all-German free elections. These suggestions are pertinent and practical. The talks between the delegation of the German Democratic Republic government and the Soviet government in Moscow and the achievements obtained have even more fully demonstrated the sincere desire of the Soviet Union to seek a peaceful solution to the German question. Whether the German question can be resolved as soon as possible depends entirely on whether the Western countries are willing to abandon their consistent policy of delay and obstruction. As Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his speech at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 8: "The German question should and can be resolved." "The obligation undertaken by the major powers is to maintain, not to destroy, the national unity of Germany, and to ensure that Germany is transformed into a peace-loving democratic country, and not to promote the revival of German militarism. The Soviet side will do everything in its power to promote the implementation of these obligations." The Soviet Union's position is firm and unwavering, and the people of the world are demanding that the Western countries change their attitude so that the German question can be resolved quickly.

    德国问题为什么拖延八年不能解决
    谭文瑞
    战争结束已经八年，到现在对德和约还没有缔订，德国仍然处于分裂和被占领的状态。这是什么原因呢？
    关于战后处置德国的原则，美、苏、英三国于一九四五年所签订的以及后来法国也参加了的波茨坦协定曾有明白的规定：“德国之军国主义及纳粹主义将予根除，各盟国将一致协议于目前或未来采取其他确使德国永不再威胁其邻邦或全球和平之必要措置。盟方并无毁灭或奴使德国人民之心意，盟方实欲德国人民获得机会，在一民主及和平之基础上建造其新生活。”换句话说，就是要使德国成为一个统一、独立、民主与爱好和平的国家。关于解决德国问题的步骤，波茨坦协定也规定了：设立外长会议“负责准备德国之和平解决方案，此将于合乎目的之德国政府成立时，由德国政府予以接受。”很显然的，如果曾在波茨坦协定上签字的四大国都真正履行这一国际协定的庄严义务，按照它所规定的原则和步骤去解决德国问题，那么对德和约早就可以缔结，德国早就可以恢复统一了。
    苏联一贯忠诚地执行波茨坦会议的决议。当与德国从前的五个同盟国意、罗、保、匈及芬兰缔结和约的工作大体完成的时候，苏联就提出了应该开始筹备对德和约和按照波茨坦协定着手组织全德政府的主张。但是在一九四七年的莫斯科和伦敦两次外长会议上，美、英、法极力阻挠讨论苏联关于成立全德民主政府和召开和会来讨论对德和约草案的建议，使外长会议毫无结果。后来，西方国家干脆采取了抵制举行四外长会议的蛮横态度。只是由于苏联的努力，它们才于一九四九年五月同意了在巴黎恢复外长会议讨论德国问题。但是在这次会议上，西方国家对于苏联所提有关德国基本问题的建议仍然采取否定的立场，因此也没有能达成重大的协议。
    与拖延解决德国问题的同时，美国及其英法伙伴开始执行复活德国军国主义和分裂德国的政策。美国统治集团的喉舌“纽约先驱论坛报”在一九四七年十二月二十日评论伦敦外长会议时曾露骨地说：“我们已经走到路的尽头了。雅尔塔的时代已经过去了。……德国的分裂可以使我们放手把西德列入西方国家的体系以内了。”
    从一九四七年起，美、英、法三国连续采取了破坏波茨坦协定的分裂德国的片面措施。一九四七年八月，美英把它们合并的美英占领区参加了“马歇尔计划”，一九四八年六月，美、英、法三国在西德单独实行货币改革，一九四九年四月，美英又进一步片面公布了西德占领法规。同年九月三国制造了波恩“国家”，西方国家的分裂活动至此达到了登峰造极的地步。美、英、法扶植了以阿登纳为首的一小撮复仇主义者组成波恩傀儡政权，加深了德国的分裂。
    波恩“国家”的成立，使德国人民所受到的奴役与战争的威胁更加严重了。德国人民明白必须把国家的命运掌握到自己的手里来，才能避免民族的灾难。以德国统一社会党为首的德国民主力量，决心把建立统一、独立、民主、和平的德国的事业担当起来。德意志民主共和国于一九四九年十月七日宣告成立，于是德国人民有了争取国家统一与民主、独立的堡垒。德意志民主共和国自成立之日起，就领导德国人民坚持不懈地为争取国家的统一与独立而斗争。一九五○年十二月一日格罗提渥曾向阿登纳建议开始协商建立全德立宪议会，以筹备成立全德的临时政府，这一建议竟为波恩议会所拒绝。阿登纳政权无耻地出卖德国民族的利益，执行着美国分裂德国的政策。虽然如此，德意志民主共和国仍然继续不屈不挠地为促成东西部的谅解和恢复国家的统一而努力。
    苏联一贯支持德国人民要求统一、独立、民主与和平的愿望。因此德意志民主共和国成立后，苏联就决定把苏联在德国占领区的军政府的行政职权移交与德意志民主共和国临时政府，并声明“苏联政府仍将在和平与民主基础上继续充分地协助恢复德国统一，并同样充分地协助与德国签订和约。”
    一九五○年，在苏联的提议下，苏联、德意志民主共和国和东欧人民民主国家举行了八国外长会议，坚决表示反对西方国家在德国的侵略政策，并拟定了解决德国问题的民主纲领，要求毫不迟延地缔结对德和约，遵照波茨坦协定恢复德国的统一，并规定所有各国占领军在和约缔结后一年内自德国撤退。为了争取德国问题的和平解决，苏联一再照会美、英、法三国，敦促它们立即就缔结对德和约和统一德国问题进行谈判，并提出解决德国问题的具体建议。但是美国及其英法伙伴，拒绝了一切缔结对德和约和统一德国的切实办法，而变本加厉地进行重新武装西德，并企图把西德拖进北大西洋侵略集团。
    一九五二年五月，美、英、法三国竟不顾苏联和全世界人民的反对，单独与西德傀儡政府签订了所谓
    “一般性条约”和“欧洲防务集团”条约。前者保证美英法三国军队占领西德五十年，并使重新武装西德合法化；后者规定建立所谓“欧洲军”，而以重建的希特勒国防军为这支侵略军队的骨干。事实上西方国家在进行分裂德国的勾当的同时，就已步步加紧地实行西德的重新军国主义化。自从一九四九年起，美、英、法便积极恢复西德的军事潜力，在“劳动大队”、“警备队”等各种名目的掩饰下，加速重建由希特勒将领指挥的西德军队。到一九五○年西德为军事生产服务的工业，每月平均产量已达到一九三六年的百分之一百二十；“纽约先驱论坛报”一九五一年四月曾证实：“建立一支约有十二个师并配备有六百架飞机作为战术支援的德国作战部队的计划已快完成。”而且“防御港口的海军也已计划就绪。建立以装甲车和反装甲炮的德国部队的计划也在准备中。”此外，美、英、法并在西德大量增加占领军，修筑军事基地和实行各种准备战争的军事措施，把西德变成为发动新战争的桥头堡。西方国家制造波恩和巴黎战争条约，公开地武装西德和加深德国的分裂的行动，显然是与建立一个独立、和平、统一、民主的德国的目的背道而驰的。
    当时苏联严正地斥责了西方国家破坏波茨坦协定的罪行，并再一次表示：“苏联政府愿尽其所能加速缔结对德和约，并恢复全德政府。”苏联这种光明磊落的态度，充分表明了苏联对于和平解决德国问题的诚意。但是西方国家竭力规避谈判解决德国问题，藉口还没有一个全德政府，拒绝考虑对德和约，而把问题纠缠在调查德国举行自由选举的条件的枝节问题上。
    根据上面的事实，只要是敢于看见阳光、敢于正视现实的人，都能判断：德国问题所以迄今未能和平解决，并且已经成为欧洲和世界和平的日益严重的威胁，完全是美国及其英法实行分裂德国，并进一步恢复德国战争温床的罪恶政策所造成的结果。
    美国这个罪恶的对德政策，不可避免地引起了德国和西欧人民的反抗，而且西欧国家特别是法国的统治阶级对西德军国主义的复活也深怀戒心。正因为如此，美国扶植西德的计划，特别是建立“欧洲军”的计划，遭受了很大的挫折，巴黎条约和波恩条约也至今仍未在法国和其他西欧国家议会中获得批准。
    今年以来，全世界人民受到了苏联和平倡议的鼓舞，热烈地展开了要求以和平协商解决国际争端的运动。朝鲜停战以后，全世界人民迫切希望有关各大国尽早和平解决德国问题，以进一步缓和国际紧张局势。由于广大人民这种不可抗拒的压力，美国及其英、法伙伴不能不设法掩饰它们实际坚持分裂德国与阻延缔结对德和约的罪恶勾当。七月间美英法三外长会议发表的公报假惺惺地宣称：“三国决心进行新的努力以求结束德国的分裂状态。”七月十五日三国并分别照会苏联政府，建议在九月末举行四国外长会议，讨论有关调查德国举行自由选举条件的问题。但是西方国家的真正目的立刻就为各国舆论所揭露；它们实际上是不想解决德国问题，只是想借此抵制广泛讨论国际问题的大国会议，并在西德选举前夕为阿登纳反动集团撑腰。正如苏联政府八月四日的照会所指出的，西方国家的照会“根本无意促进德国根本问题的解决”，“这样的建议不仅不能促成德国的统一和全德民主政府的成立，而且会使德国保持东西两部的分裂局面，并像以往一样延缓和约的缔结。”
    但是，苏联争取和平解决德国问题的努力并不稍懈。苏联政府八月四日致美、英、法的照会，表示仍然愿意举行四国外长会议，可是建议会议的议程应该包括讨论恢复德国统一和缔结对德和约问题，并且讨论缓和国际紧张局势的办法。八月十五日苏联政府再度照会美英法三国政府，建议立即采取实际措施解决德国问题，包括在六个月内召开由所有有关国家参加的和平会议讨论对德和约以及组织全德临时政府，举行全德自由选举。这些建议都是中肯而切实可行的。德意志民主共和国政府代表团与苏联政府在莫斯科举行的会谈以及所获得的成就，更充分表现了苏联谋求和平解决德国问题的真诚愿望。德国问题的能否尽早获得解决，关键完全在于西方国家是否愿意放弃其一贯的拖延阻挠政策。正如马林科夫同志八月八日在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上的演说中所指出的：“德国问题是应该而且可以解决的。”“大国承担的义务是维持、而不是破坏德国的民族统一，保证把德国改造成一个爱好和平的民主国家，而不要促进德国军国主义的复活。苏联方面将竭尽全力促进这些义务的执行。”苏联的立场是坚定不移的，全世界人民都要求西方国家改变它们的态度，使德国问题迅速获得解决。
