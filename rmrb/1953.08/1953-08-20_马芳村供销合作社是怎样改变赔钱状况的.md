The Mafang Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yushu County, Jilin Province, from its establishment in 1949 until the end of last year, had very poor business operations and lost money year after year. The relationship between the cooperative members and the cooperative was also very distant. The cooperative's cadres said: The losses were due to "little capital, little business, few members, and high expenses." But why did this "three littles and one high" occur? They couldn't find the key for a long time, so naturally they couldn't find a positive way to reverse the situation.

So, why did the Mafang Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative lose money year after year? Let's listen to the members' reflections on the cooperative!

Since its establishment in 1949, the cooperative has never reported its work to the members or member representatives. In order to expand the cooperative's store, the villagers had put in a lot of effort to free up five main rooms and three side rooms for the cooperative. However, the former director of the cooperative, Tian Shuchun, only talked about "grandeur." He expanded the office, leaving only one room for business. The cooperative had less than two hundred kinds of goods in total, and many goods had nowhere to be placed, so they could only be locked in cabinets. When members came to buy things, they could only look at the samples. If they asked to change the style, the salesperson would say: Buy it or not, that's all we have. The members worked in the fields during the day, but the cooperative was not open in the morning or evening, so they couldn't buy anything. After the autumn harvest, the cooperative suppressed the grade and price of grain purchases, always paying one grade lower than neighboring cooperatives, deducting fourteen yuan more per jin for transportation costs, and using a large scale for intake and a small scale for output. When the villagers asked what was going on, the inspector said: This is stipulated by the state. The cooperative's business operations often focused on what made money, without considering the needs of the members. Sometimes, when they saw that a certain commodity sold quickly, they would continuously raise the price. During the Spring Festival of 1950, when selling pears, they raised the price three times in one day because many members were buying them. The cooperative cadres were very rude and often used "national policies" and "systems" to intimidate the masses, so the number of members buying things at the cooperative gradually decreased. The cooperative's business was sluggish, but various expenses did not decrease, resulting in huge losses. The cooperative cadres once mobilized the members to increase their shares, but the members responded: "It would be a good thing if we didn't lose money to your cooperative! There's nothing to buy, we're about to lose all our capital, and you still want us to increase our shares!"

After the leadership discovered this serious situation, they sent Liu Lianfeng to Mafang Village as the director last spring. Liu Lianfeng had been working in this village since the land reform. He was loyal, honest, and good at discussing matters with the masses. After he arrived at the cooperative, he often educated the staff to correct their service attitude and studied how to actively expand the business. However, because the idea of serving agricultural production was not clear, the relationship between the cooperative and the members was not fundamentally changed before the end of 1952, and the loss-making situation was not reversed.

At the beginning of this year, Liu Lianfeng went to the county to attend a meeting and received instructions from the county cooperative on ensuring the supply of means of agricultural production to farmers. In order to achieve timely and accurate supply, Liu Lianfeng obtained the support of the Party branch and led three cadres to go deep into the peasant households to discuss production plans in conjunction with the mutual aid teams, and to investigate the farmers' needs for means of production. At first, the farmers thought, "Isn't the survey just nonsense!" When Liu Lianfeng mentioned signing "combination contracts," some members said:

"Who would sign that thing? You can buy goods anywhere if you have money!" Some members also asked: "Are we buying on credit? Can we not buy if we sign? What if we don't have money? If the goods don't arrive on time after signing the contract, who will be responsible for the delay in production?" Based on these opinions, they first reviewed the shortcomings of the cooperative's past work, and focused on explaining to the farmers that "combination contracts" should only be signed voluntarily by both parties. If a "combination contract" is signed, the cooperative will know how much goods to prepare, which will guarantee the supply of the means of production needed by the farmers; if the goods arrive in time, are of suitable specifications, and the price is fair, the contract should guarantee the purchase; if the funds are not available, grain, scrap copper, scrap iron, etc. can be used for exchange; although a contract is signed, if changes are needed, they can be proposed in advance, and modifications can be made with the consent of both parties. Some farmers felt relieved and felt that signing "combination contracts" only had advantages and no disadvantages. As a result, eighteen mutual aid teams signed eighteen "combination contracts" with the supply and marketing cooperative. The contract stipulates: the main varieties supplied by the cooperative are plows, hoes, hoes, iron forks, etc.; the main agricultural and sideline products that the cooperative helps the mutual aid team sell. The cooperative also conducted typical surveys of individual farmers, and based on the varieties and numbers needed by the farmers in the whole village, submitted orders to the county cooperative. Because of the investigation and the signing of "combination contracts," there was a more practical supply plan, and with frequent contact with the county cooperative, the means of production procured by the Mafang Village Cooperative were very timely. For example, in early February, before the ice and snow thawed, the manure-digging hoes were brought back; other forks, plows, hoes, nail rakes, etc. were delivered to the farmers in advance. Moreover, the prices were fair and the quality was appropriate. Therefore, the means of production added by the farmers for spring plowing and summer weeding were all bought from the cooperative. According to statistics at the end of May, the quantity of goods sold by the cooperative accounted for 79.6% of the procurement plan. In terms of grain procurement, the cooperative thoroughly corrected the practice of suppressing grades and prices, and paid according to the reasonable price list stipulated by the state, and graded and priced the grain according to its quality. As a result, farmers were even more enthusiastic about selling grain, and the cooperative's procurement figures gradually increased, and the supply and marketing business also became active, with a significant increase in turnover. In the first half of this year, the total supply and marketing volume was 593.23 million yuan, an increase of 65% compared with the same period last year. The cooperative tried its best to reduce expenses in its operations. A shortage book was established at the counter. The purchasing staff procured goods based on the farmers' purchase orders and the counter diary, and adopted the method of "frequent purchases and quick sales" to solve the difficulty of insufficient funds. The number of commodities also increased from 351 to 871, and there were never any commodity backlogs or out-of-stock phenomena. In the first half of this year, the capital turnover was more than nine times. A responsibility system was established for salespeople and warehouse keepers, which greatly reduced unnecessary losses and relatively reduced expenses. The commodity circulation fee dropped from 9.6% to 3.5%. This year, the entire cooperative added four cadres, and various business expenses did not increase. Due to the implementation of the policy of serving agricultural production, the expansion of supply and marketing business, and the improvement of business management, the first quarter's surplus was 6.03 million yuan, and the second quarter's surplus was 1.56 million yuan, fundamentally changing the cooperative's historical loss-making phenomenon.

In order to take care of the farmers' difficulties during the busy farming season, the Mafang Cooperative adopted the method of "delivering goods to the door and purchasing on the spot" from the beginning of spring plowing until summer weeding, while publicizing, selling goods, buying grain, and placing orders. The members were very satisfied and specially composed a clapper rhyme for the cooperative:

	Mafang Cooperative is really good,
	Changed its appearance and added goods;
	The cadres have a good service attitude,
	Delivering goods to the door, purchasing on the spot,
	Meeting with a smile.

    马芳村供销合作社是怎样改变赔钱状况的
    王会斌
    吉林省榆树县马芳村供销合作社，从一九四九年建社，到去年年底，业务经营情况一直非常不好，连年赔钱，社员和合作社的关系也很疏远。社的干部说：赔钱是因“资金少，业务少，社员少，开支多”。但为什么会发生这“三少一多”呢？他们长期没找出关键所在，当然也就找不出积极扭转的办法。
    到底马芳村供销合作社为什么连年赔钱呢？且听听社员们对合作社的反映吧！
    合作社从一九四九年成立后，从来没有向社员或社员代表报告过工作。为着扩大合作社门市部，老乡们曾经费了挺大的劲，腾出五间正房、三间厢房来给合作社。但从前的合作社主任田树春专讲“阔气”，他扩大了办公室，只留一间房进行营业。合作社统共不到二百种商品，许多货物还没处放，只能锁在柜子里。社员来买东西只能看看样子，如果要求换换样，营业员就说：爱买不买，就这玩艺。社员白天下地干活，但合作社早晚却不开门，要买东西也买不着。秋后，合作社收购粮食时压等压价，总比邻社低一等付款，运费每斤还多扣十四元，而且是大秤进小秤出。老乡要问问是怎么回事，化验员说：这是国家规定的。合作社经营商品，常常是什么赚钱就办什么，根本不考虑社员群众的需要。有时，他们看到某种商品销的快，就接连提价。一九五○年春节卖梨，因为社员购的多，一天就提了三次价。合作社干部态度非常蛮横，动不动拿“国家政策”、“制度”来威吓群众，因此社员到合作社买东西的就逐渐减少了。合作社业务萧条，各种费用开支却并没减少，结果大大赔钱。合作社干部曾发动社员增扩股金，社员纷纷反映说：“不跟你们合作社要钱就算好事！买啥没啥，老本都快赔光啦，还扩股呢！”
    领导方面发现这种严重情况后，在去年春派刘连奉到马芳村社去当主任。刘连奉从土地改革时就在这村工作，为人忠诚朴实，有事善于和群众商量。他到合作社后，常常教育职工端正服务态度，并研究如何积极扩大业务。但由于为农业生产服务的思想不明确，一九五二年底以前并没有从根本上改变合作社与社员的关系，也没有扭转赔钱的局面。
    今年初，刘连奉去县里开会，接受了县社关于保证作好农民生产资料供应的指示。为了做到及时准确供应，刘连奉取得党支部的支持，带了三名干部深入农户，结合互助组讨论生产计划，调查农民对生产资料的需要。起初，农民认为“调查还不是瞎扯！”刘连奉提到订结合合同时，有的社员说：
    “谁订那玩艺呢，有钱那里买不到货？”还有的社员问：“订合同赊不赊？订了不买行不行？没钱怎么办？订了合同到时不来货，耽误生产谁负责任？”根据这些意见，他们首先检讨了合作社过去的工作缺点，着重向农民讲解了“结合合同”是要双方自愿才签订的，订了“结合合同”，合作社办货心中有数，就能保证农民对需要的生产资料的供应；如果货物来的及时，规格合适，价格公道，订了合同就应保证买；如果钱款不凑手，可用粮食、碎铜、废铁等作价交换；虽然订了合同，如果需要变动时，也可事先提出，双方同意后加以修改。有些农民心中托了底，感到订“结合合同”只有好处，没有坏处。结果，有十八个互助组和供销合作社签订了十八份“结合合同”。合同规定：合作社供应的大宗品种主要是铧子、刨槎锹、镐头、铁叉等等；合作社替互助组推销的也是主要的农副业产品。合作社对单干农户也进行了典型调查，根据全村农民需要的品种和数字，向县合作社提出了订货单。由于经过调查和签订了“结合合同”，有了比较切合实际的供应计划，再加上经常与县合作社联系，马芳村合作社办的生产资料都很及时。如二月初，冰雪没解冻，就办回刨粪镐；其他叉子、铧子、锹、钉扒子等都提前送到了农民手里。而且价格公道，质量相应。因此，农民春耕夏锄所添的生产资料全是从合作社买的。据五月末统计，合作社销货数量占进货计划百分之七九点六。合作社在收购粮食方面，彻底纠正了压等压价的做法，都按着国家规定的合理牌价，按等论价付款，收购的粮食并作到了分等分级保管。这样一来，农民卖粮越发踊跃，合作社的收购数字逐渐增加，供销业务也随着活跃起来，营业额显著上升。今年上半年供销总额五亿九千三百二十三万元，比去年同时期增加百分之六十五。合作社在经营上尽量作到减少开支，柜台建立了缺货账，采买员根据农民提货单和柜台日记办货，采取“勤买快卖”的办法，解决了资金不足的困难，商品也由三五一种增到八七一种，从未发生商品积压和脱销现象。今年上半年资金周转九次多。营业员、保管员建立了责任制，大大减少了不必要的损失，相对地缩小了开支，商品流转费由百分之九点六降到百分之三点五。今年全社增添四名干部，各种业务开支并没增加。由于贯彻了为农业生产服务的方针，扩大了供销业务，改善了经营管理，第一季度盈余六百零三万元，二季度盈余一百五十六万元，根本改变了该社历史上的赔本现象。
    为了照顾农民在农忙时的困难，马芳合作社从春耕开始直到夏锄，一直采取“送货上门，就地收购”的办法，边宣传，边卖货，边买粮，边订货，社员非常满意，特为合作社编了一首快板：
    马芳社，真不错，
    改变门面添了货；
    干部服务态度好，
    送货上门，就地收购，
    见面笑呵呵。
