    The Northeast Region has completed the adjustment and rectification of all teacher training colleges in the region. The original nine teacher training colleges in the Northeast, after adjustment and merger, have been reorganized into four, namely Northeast Normal University, Northeast Education Institute, Harbin Teacher Training College, and Dalian Teacher Training College; located in Changchun, Shenyang, Harbin, Dalian, and other places. At present, these colleges have been strengthened in terms of administrative leadership, faculty, and teaching equipment, and are basically equipped to cultivate high-quality secondary school teachers.
    In the past three years, in addition to the original Northeast Normal University, provinces and cities in the Northeast have successively established eight teacher training colleges. These colleges have trained more than 5,100 junior high school teachers. However, due to the dispersed location of these schools, there are common problems such as insufficient faculty and simple equipment, resulting in low teaching quality. In order to implement the policy of "consolidation, key development, improving quality, and steady progress," the Northeast Administrative Committee has led the work of adjusting and rectifying the teacher training colleges from the spring of this year, and this work has been basically completed by the beginning of August. Currently, in addition to Northeast Normal University, the other three colleges have established a total of nine specialized courses, including Chinese Language and Literature, Russian, History, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Fine Arts, according to the principle of "focusing on key subjects and appropriate division of labor." After the adjustment, the goal of centralized use has been achieved in terms of both teachers and equipment. In terms of faculty, it has not only solved the needs of the three colleges themselves, but also provided more than 100 senior high school teachers to the provinces and cities. The teaching equipment has also been significantly improved. For example, the experimental instruments of the Physics Department of Dalian Teacher Training College have been increased to fully meet the needs of future teaching. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北区完成调整整顿全区师范专科院校工作
    东北区已完成调整整顿全区师范专科院校的工作。东北原有的九所师范专科院校，经过调整合并后，改为四所，即东北师范大学、东北教育学院、哈尔滨师范专科学校和大连师范专科学校；分设在长春、沈阳、哈尔滨、大连等地。目前这些院校，在行政领导、师资及教学设备上已有加强，基本上具备了培养质量较高的中学师资的条件。
    三年来，东北区除原有的东北师范大学外，各省、市先后成立了八所师范专科学校。这些专科学校已培养出五千一百多名初中教师。但由于这些学校的设置分散，普遍存在师资不足和设备简陋等问题，因而教学质量不高。东北行政委员会为贯彻“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的方针，从今年春季起就领导进行调整整顿师范专科院校各科的工作，到八月初这一工作已基本完成。目前，除东北师范大学外，其他三所院校根据“重点设科，适当分工”的原则共设立了中国语文、俄文、历史、地理、数学、物理、化学、生物、美术等九个专修科。经调整后，在教师和设备各方面都达到了集中使用的目的。在教师方面不仅解决了三所院校本身的需要，还给各省、市的中学输送了一百多名高中师资。在教学设备上也显著地改善了，如大连师范专科学校物理科的试验仪器已增加到可以完全满足今后教学上的需要。（新华社）
