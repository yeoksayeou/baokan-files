    Several Questions Regarding Population Survey Registration
    Editor's Note: Many readers and cadres participating in the population survey registration work in various regions have written to the Central Population Survey Registration Office and this newspaper to inquire about issues such as household establishment conditions and registration methods for certain mobile populations. The Central Population Survey Registration Office's responses are published below:

    Question: What conditions must be met to be considered a household?
    Answer: A household is a residential unit. All people who regularly live and live together can be established as a household. This year's population survey registration work in China is being conducted on a household basis, using a standard time as the basis for registering permanent residents. Therefore, correctly identifying and dividing household residential units is beneficial for accurately conducting the population survey; and our purpose of establishing households is to facilitate population survey registration. The "National Population Survey Registration Measures" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government stipulate that family members who live together can be counted as one household, and single residents and people residing in institutions, organizations, schools, factories, mines, and other units can also be counted as one household. When conducting population survey registration, local areas can also determine household establishment based on the original household registration foundation and in combination with local specific circumstances. For example: if a family lives together, but is divided into several residences due to housing limitations or other reasons; or if several single people live in the same room without any living relationship; they can all be established as one household. Family households residing in institutions, schools, and other units should be registered uniformly within the respective institutions and schools, without the need for separate household establishment.

    Question: How should the water population be registered?
    Answer: Among the water population, ship households that have been determined to have port registration and have registered their household in the port registration location, regardless of where they are berthed at the time of the survey registration, should be registered as permanent residents in their port registration location. If the port registration and household registration are not in the same location or have household registration but no port registration, regardless of where they are berthed at the time of the survey registration, they should all be registered as permanent residents in their household registration location. Some ship households have determined port registration but have not registered their household, or even have neither determined port registration nor household registration. These people should be registered as permanent residents at the berthing location at the time of the survey and should obtain a certificate from the local population survey registration office after registration for inspection purposes.

    For the population of ships, barges, and wooden boats belonging to public and private shipping companies, regardless of whether they regularly reside on the ships, if they have a residence on land at the time of the survey registration, they should be registered as permanent residents at their residence; if they do not have a residence, they should be registered as permanent residents at the company to which their ship belongs.

    Question: How should geological exploration teams, construction sites, and river management and road construction personnel be registered?
    Answer: The location where geological exploration teams, construction sites, and river management and road construction personnel should be registered should be determined mainly based on the living situation of these people and whether their participation in work is fixed or temporary. Fixed staff who regularly live in the work unit should be registered as permanent residents in the work department; those who regularly go home to live should be registered as permanent residents at home. Temporary staff, regardless of whether they regularly live in the work department, should be registered as permanent residents at home. For example: if the work area of the geological exploration team is fixed, they should be registered as permanent residents in the work area. Students on temporary internships in the exploration team, survey and inspection personnel, and staff members of geological reconnaissance teams with unfixed work locations should still be registered as permanent residents at their original regular residence or the original dispatching organization. Short-term workers and migrant workers participating in construction sites and river management and road construction are temporarily away from home and do not regularly work in a fixed location, but are often mobile. At the time of the survey registration, except for those who have been transferred to professional workers and can be registered as employees, the rest should still be registered as permanent residents at home.

    Question: How should people who often go out to perform, blacksmith, saw pot, and saw basin be registered?
    Answer: Mobile populations who go out to perform, blacksmith, saw pot, and saw basin, if they do not have a permanent residence outside and return home every year, should be registered as permanent residents at home. If these people do not have a fixed residence and household registration and often move around, they should be registered as permanent residents at the location where they are surveyed. Because this group of people has high mobility, omissions may occur. This requires the surveyed people to actively assist the people's government in this work, and proactively register as permanent residents at a local population survey registration station in accordance with the principle of no duplication and no omission.

    Question: How should those imprisoned and detained be registered?
    Answer: People who are temporarily detained or detained for violations, fights, and other disputes should be registered as permanent residents at their original residence or at home; other imprisoned criminals, whether convicted or not, should be registered by the enforcement agency, and registered as absent people at home.

    Question: Some farmers in some areas go to other places to cultivate land every year, going in the spring and returning in the winter. How should these people be registered?
    Answer: It is understood that in some areas of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Ningxia, Hebei and other provinces, a considerable number of farmers go to other provinces to cultivate land every year. They spend most of the year engaged in agricultural production in other places, only returning home in winter. During the population survey, these people and their accompanying family members who go and return together should be registered as permanent residents in the cultivated area, and registered as absent people in the original home. However, family members who go for temporary visits should still be registered as permanent residents in the original home.

    关于人口调查登记的几个问题
    编者按：各地不少读者和参加人口调查登记工作的干部给中央人口调查登记办公室和本报来信，询问有关立户条件和某些流动性人口的登记办法等问题。现将中央人口调查登记办公室的答复发表如下：
    问：具备什么条件才可以作为一户？
    答：户是一个居住单位，凡是经常居住和生活在一起的人，都可以立为一户。今年我国的人口调查登记工作就是以户为单位，采取以标准时间为准登记常住人口的办法进行的。因此，正确地辨别和划分户的居住单位，对于准确地进行人口调查是有好处的；而我们立户的用意，也就在于便利人口的调查登记。在中央人民政府政务院发布的“全国人口调查登记办法”中规定，家庭成员在一起住宿的可以算作一户，独身居住以及在机关、团体、学校、工厂、矿山等单位内居住的人口也可以算作一户。各地在进行人口调查登记时，还可以依据原有户口基础、结合当地具体情况来决定立户。如：一家人生活在一起，但限于房屋或有其他原因而分住几处者；或者几个独身人虽无生活关系，而同住在一个房间内者；都可以立为一户。在机关、学校等单位内居住的家庭户，就在各机关、学校内统一办理登记，不必单独立户。
    问：水上人口应如何登记？
    答：水上人口中，已经确定港籍并已在港籍所在地登记过户口的船舶户，不论调查登记时停泊在何地，应一律在其港籍所在地登记为常住人口。如果港籍与户口不在一地或有户口而无港籍者，不论调查登记时停泊何地，应一律在其户口所在地登记为常住人口。有些船舶户虽然已经确定港籍但没有登记过户口，甚至既未确定港籍又没有户口，这些人都应该在调查时的停泊地登记为常住人口，并应在登记后取得当地人口调查登记办公室的证明，以便检查。
    公私营船舶公司所属之轮船、驳船、木船之人口，不论他们是否经常居住在船舶上，在调查登记时，如果在陆上有住所者，在其住所登记为常住人口；没有住所者，在其船舶所属之公司登记为常住人口。
    问：地质勘探队、建筑工地及治河筑路等人员应如何登记？
    答：地质勘探队、建筑工地及治河筑路等人员应在何地进行登记，主要应看这些人的居住情况和参加工作是固定的还是临时性的来确定。固定的工作人员，经常在工作单位住宿者，应在该工作部门登记为常住人口；经常回家住宿者，应在家中登记为常住人口。临时性的工作人员，则不论是否在工作部门经常居住，都应在家中登记为常住人口。如：地质勘探队工作地区固定者，在工作地区登记为常住人口。在勘探队临时实习的学生，调查、视察人员以及工作地点不固定的地质普查队等工作人员，仍在原来经常居住地或原派出机关登记为常住人口。参加建筑工地及治河筑路的短工、民工等，因为他们都是离家临时外出的性质，并不经常固定在一地工作，而是时常流动的，在调查登记时，除了他们有的已转为职业性的工人可按职工登记外，其余的人仍应在家中登记为常住人口。
    问：经常外出卖艺、打铁、锯锅、锯盆等人应如何登记？
    答：外出卖艺、打铁、锯锅、锯盆等流动人口，如果在外并没有定居而又年年回家者，应在家中登记为常住人口。如果这些人没有固定居住地址和户口，而经常流动各地，应在调查时所在地登记为常住人口。由于这部分人的流动性很大，可能会发生遗漏的现象，这就需要被调查的人积极协助人民政府进行这一工作，按不重复、不遗漏的原则主动地向一个地方的人口调查登记站登记为常住人口。
    问：被监禁和拘留者如何登记？
    答：因违警、斗殴及其他纠纷等被临时羁押或拘留的人，在其原住所或家中登记为常住人口；其他被监禁的人犯，则不论是已决犯或未决犯，均应由执行机关办理登记，在家中登记为在外人口。
    问：有些地区的农民，每年都到外地耕种，春去冬回，这些人应如何登记？
    答：据了解，在陕西、山西、宁夏、河北等省的某些地区，每年都有相当数量的农民到外省种地。他们在一年内大部分时间是留在外地从事农业生产，仅在冬季回家。在人口调查时，这些人及其同去同回的家属，应在耕种地区登记为常住人口，在原家中登记为在外人口。但是对其临时探望去的家属，则仍应在原家中登记为常住人口。
