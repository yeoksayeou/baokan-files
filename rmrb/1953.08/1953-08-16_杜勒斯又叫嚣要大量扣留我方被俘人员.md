Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 14th: Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: After U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made a speech on the 10th threatening to detain a large number of our captured personnel, he blatantly clamored at a press conference on the 12th that if the Communists do not completely repatriate the prisoners of war they are holding, this could be considered a blatant violation of the armistice agreement and a basis for resuming fighting on the war-torn Korean Peninsula.

This Dulles, who is accustomed to fabricating rumors, had difficulty in fabricating any basis when repeating his slanders that the Korean and Chinese sides were trying to detain prisoners of war and issuing blackmail on this basis. On the contrary, he contradictorily admitted: "There is no proof yet that the Communist side really wants to detain Allied prisoners of war." Dulles, in his own words, demonstrated to the world that this U.S. Secretary of State, completely like a rogue, can shout and rant arbitrarily and slander people without being able to produce any factual basis.

However, irrefutable evidence proves that it is not the Korean and Chinese sides that are trying to detain and have in fact detained a large number of prisoners of war and refuse to repatriate them, but precisely the American side. Before the Korean armistice was realized, it was well known that the American side had condoned Syngman Rhee's forced detention of more than 27,000 of our captured personnel. At the same time, the American side deducted 2,000 people from the 76,000 of our captured personnel who insisted on repatriation reported by Clark in his letter of May 27 this year. After the Korean armistice was realized, the American side continued to use force on Geoje Island to carry out compulsory "screenings" on a large scale, forcibly detaining many of our captured personnel. According to the repatriated Chinese People's Volunteers prisoners of war, there are now at least two to three hundred of our captured personnel who should be directly repatriated still being detained by the American side and have not been repatriated. In addition, there are still many prisoners of war secretly detained by the American side, such as Wang Fang, Wei Lin, Park Sang-hyun, and Sun Zhenguan (prisoner number 700101), who was once elected as a prisoner of war representative. Sun Zhenguan's name is listed first on the list of prisoners of war that the other side gave us, and he has not been repatriated to this day. The American side's behavior, as Dulles said, should be considered "a violation of the armistice terms."

The American side's violation of the armistice agreement is not limited to the issue of prisoners of war. Dulles recently concluded a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with Syngman Rhee, which stipulates that the U.S. military has the right to be stationed in South Korea indefinitely, which is a violation of the principle stipulated in the armistice agreement that the political conference should discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. Not only that, but since the armistice, American personnel have frequently violated the armistice agreement and invaded the demilitarized zone, and the American side has had to admit it several times. These irrefutable facts cannot be concealed by Dulles's rhetoric.

Dulles dares not mention these acts of the American side that violate the armistice agreement, but makes unfounded nonsense. It is not surprising that he is keen on lying and blackmail in an attempt to divert the world's attention and conceal the American side's violations of the armistice agreement. He is trying to create a "basis" to continue detaining our captured personnel and thereby evade their responsibility for recovering the more than 27,000 prisoners of war forcibly detained by Syngman Rhee and the 2,000 prisoners of war forcibly detained by the American side. He attempts to use these rogue tactics and rogue clamors to maintain the tense situation in Korea and the Far East and continue to pursue its policy of aggression. The ulterior motives hidden behind Dulles's clamors are already "a matter of common knowledge."

The Korean and Chinese sides have always conscientiously abided by the Korean Armistice Agreement and have been working unremittingly to ensure the full implementation of the armistice agreement and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. It will never be affected by any rumors, slanders, or empty threats. Therefore, Dulles's attempt to slander and blackmail the Korean and Chinese sides with completely irresponsible words, like a rogue spitting on people and bluffing, will only reveal his despicable and shameless nature and will not achieve anything or gain anything.

### 杜勒斯又叫嚣要大量扣留我方被俘人员

    杜勒斯又叫嚣要大量扣留我方被俘人员
    【新华社开城十四日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：美国国务卿杜勒斯在十日发表了一个威胁要大量扣留我方被俘人员的谈话后，十二日，在记者招待会上又公然叫嚣说：如果共产党不把他们所拘留的战俘完全遣返，这可以被认为是公然破坏停战的行为和在饱受战争蹂躏的朝鲜半岛上恢复战斗的根据。
    这个惯于造谣生事的杜勒斯在重复他污蔑朝中方面企图所谓扣留战俘，并就此发出讹诈的言词的时候，也很难捏造出一点根据，相反地却自相矛盾地承认：现在还没有共方真想扣留联军战俘的证明。杜勒斯就在这里用自己的话向全世界说明了他这个美国国务卿，完全像流氓一样，可以连自己都提不出丝毫事实根据以前就乱吵乱嚷，任意地向人进行污蔑和讹诈。
    然而，无可辩驳的根据证明，不但企图扣留而且事实上已大批扣留战俘拒不加以遣返的，不是朝中方面，而恰恰正是美方。在朝鲜停战实现前，尽人皆知是美方纵容李承晚强迫扣留了二万七千多名我方被俘人员。同时美方并从克拉克今年五月二十七日来信所报的七万六千坚持遣返的我方被俘人员中扣掉了两千人。在朝鲜停战实现后，美方还在巨济岛上继续使用武力，大规模实行强迫“甄别”，强迫扣留了许多我方被俘人员。根据遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员说，现在，至少还有二、三百名应该直接遣返的我方被俘人员尚在美方拘禁下没有遣返。除此之外，还有不少被俘人员被美方秘密拘禁着，如王芳、魏林、朴相贤和曾被推举为战俘代表的孙振冠（俘号七零零一零一）。孙振冠的名字列在对方交给我方的战俘名单上第一名，至今也未被遣返。美方的这种行为，才像杜勒斯说的那样，应该被认为是“破坏停战条款的行为”。
    美方对停战协定的破坏还不只是在战俘问题上。杜勒斯最近和李承晚订立了所谓“共同防御条约”，条约中规定美军有权无限期地驻在南朝鲜，这就是对停战协定中规定的政治会议要讨论的一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的原则的破坏。不仅如此，自从停战以来，美方人员还曾经常违反停战协定，侵入非军事区，美方也已不得不几次予以承认。这些确确凿凿的事实决不是杜勒斯的花言巧语所能掩饰得了的。
    杜勒斯对于美方这些破坏停战协定的行为提也不敢提，却毫无根据地胡言乱语，这是不足为怪的。他热中于说谎和讹诈，要想转移全世界的注意力，掩饰美方破坏停战协定的行为。他竭力想制造“根据”来继续扣留我方被俘人员，并借此推卸他们对于追回被李承晚强迫扣留的二万七千多名以及被美方所强迫扣留的两千名战俘所应负的责任。他企图用这些流氓手段和流氓叫嚣来保持朝鲜和远东局势的紧张状态，继续推行它的侵略政策。隐藏在杜勒斯叫嚣背后的这些不可告人的心计，已经是“司马昭之心，路人皆知”了。
    朝中方面一贯切实遵守朝鲜停战协定，并坚定地为保证停战协定的完全实施与和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗不懈，它决不受任何造谣中伤和虚声恫吓的影响。因此，杜勒斯要想用完全不负责任的言词来诬蔑和讹诈朝中方面，就像流氓向人吐口水和虚张声势一样，除了只是显出他的卑鄙无耻的本相而外，是起不了一点作用和得不到一点东西的。
