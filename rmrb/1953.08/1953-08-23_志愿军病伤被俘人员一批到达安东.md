Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 22nd. A batch of 310 sick and wounded captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who were being repatriated, returned to the motherland on a hospital train on the evening of the 21st. When the train arrived at the station, welcoming people cheered and crowded onto the train to express their warm regards. Representatives from the Liaodong Provincial People's Government, the Liaodong Military Region, the Andong Municipal People's Government, the Andong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and various people's organizations also went into the carriages and shook hands with the sick and wounded personnel by their bedsides, expressing their cordial sympathy.

The returning sick and wounded personnel were immediately sent to the hospital. Everything in the hospital had already been prepared. The wards were very spacious and well-lit. The returning sick and wounded personnel ate the rich first meal prepared for them by the people of the motherland; each of them received two dishes and a soup, including nutritious meat, eggs, onions, kidney beans, and rice and steamed buns. The hospital also prepared milk and custard for the more seriously ill and injured personnel. The hospital nurses cared for the sick and wounded personnel throughout the night, and the hospital director and doctors personally inspected the wards late into the night. The warm reception from the people of the motherland greatly moved the returning sick and wounded personnel. One sick and wounded person lying in bed said: "Just over half a month ago, we were still squatting in hell, and now I am not dreaming, I am really lying in heaven! My love for my motherland and my gratitude to the people of my motherland cannot be described!"

The returning sick and wounded personnel will undergo a short period of treatment here before being transferred to rear hospitals for recuperation.

    志愿军病伤被俘人员一批到达安东
    【新华社安东二十二日电】被遣返的中国人民志愿军的病伤被俘人员一批三百一十人于二十一日傍晚乘卫生列车回到祖国。列车抵站时，欢迎的人们欢呼着拥上车去热情慰问。辽东省人民政府、辽东军区、安东市人民政府、中共安东市委员会和各人民团体的代表也都到车厢里病床旁与病伤人员一一握手，亲切慰问。
    归来的病伤人员立即被送到医院去。医院里一切都早已准备妥当。病房很宽敞，光线也十分充足。归来的病伤人员在这里吃了祖国人民为他们预备的丰富的第一餐，他们每人都分到二个菜一个汤，这里有富于营养的肉、鸡蛋、洋葱、江豆和大米饭、馒头等。医院还为病伤较严重的人员预备了牛奶和鸡蛋糕。医院护士彻夜照顾病伤人员，医院院长和医生都深夜亲自巡视病房。祖国人民热情的接待使归来的病伤人员十分感奋，一个躺在病床上的病伤人员说：“半个多月前，我们还蹲在地狱里，而现在我并不是在做梦，确实是躺在天堂上！我热爱我的祖国，我感激祖国人民的心情是形容不出来的！”
    归来的病伤人员在这里进行短期的治疗后，将转往后方医院疗养。
