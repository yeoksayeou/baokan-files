    [This Dispatch] In early August, the valleys of the Yellow River’s middle reaches below Shanzhou, including the tributaries of Bali Hutong, Yi River, Luo River, and Qin River, experienced continuous torrential rains. The Yellow River's water level rose sharply, and the flow at Huayuankou increased, marking the largest flood peak since 1949. All regions along the river have taken emergency flood prevention measures.
    The Henan Province Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters has dispatched cadres to various critical sections to provide specific leadership and assist in flood prevention work. Leading cadres of the Henan Provincial People's Government also inspected the construction sites in the rain on the 3rd to provide guidance on flood prevention. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Government instructed all special districts and counties along the Yellow River to make flood prevention the center of all work. They required responsible cadres at all levels and flood prevention personnel to immediately go to the dikes, personally take charge, organize the masses to guard the embankments day and night, and control dangerous works to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the people along the river. Zhang Jianmin, Secretary of the Zhengzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and responsible cadres from Kaifeng, Dongming, Zhongmu and other counties have all gone to the dikes to prepare for emergency response. The masses in all dangerous sections have prepared all necessary tools and materials for emergency response and are monitoring the water situation day and night. The Xinxiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also issued flood prevention instructions, requiring all counties to make flood prevention, drainage, and flood detention the overriding center of all current work. Special cadres were assigned to go deep into districts and villages with heavy flood prevention and detention tasks to organize and mobilize the masses to check all preparations for flood prevention, emergency response, and flood detention.
    During the same period, in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, due to the combined rise of the Yellow River and the Wen River, the water level at Aishan Sunkou (Dong'e County, Shandong Province) exceeded the maximum flood level of 1949 on the evening of the 7th. In addition to dispatching responsible cadres to Heze and Liaocheng special districts to assist in flood prevention, Chao Zhefu, Vice Chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, and Zhang Jiwu, Secretary-General of the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, also inspected the dikes successively and instructed on relevant flood prevention matters. Licheng and Zhangli counties transferred more than 60 cadres to the Yellow River embankment, engaging in intense flood prevention work. From the evening of August 2nd to the 6th, the Heze section mobilized 20,000 people and more than 300 technical cadres to fight the flood fiercely for four days and nights, finally ensuring the safety of the dam.
    The water levels of the Han River and Huai River are also constantly rising. The Jingzhou Special District of Hubei Province issued an urgent instruction, requiring flood prevention laborers to bring tools and rain gear to the dikes and to immediately harvest crops on the滩地 (river flats) outside the dikes. On the 8th, the Yuekou to Xiantao section of the Han River exceeded the guaranteed water level. Currently, five counties in Jingzhou Special District have a total of 120,000 people protecting the dikes and responding to emergencies. On August 5th, the Bengbu water level of the main stream of the Huai River was approaching the warning water level, and the Fuyang water level of the Ying River tributary exceeded the warning water level by 1.74 meters and continued to rise. The water level in the Bo County section of the Wo River exceeded the warning water level by 0.68 meters. Emergency rescue and defense are currently underway in various locations.
    Since late July, the Yimeng Mountains in Shandong Province have experienced continuous heavy rains, and the Yi River has experienced a flash flood. The water level of the Yi River has gradually risen. By 9:00 AM on August 4th, the water level and flow of Linyi, Shandong, had exceeded the highest historical record. In addition to some of the Yi River flowing into the Wu River and Shu River, a large amount of the Yi River rushed south into Jiangsu Province. The Jiangsu Provincial Flood Prevention and Drought Relief Headquarters analyzed the incoming flood volume and possible development trends, and prepared to use not only Luoma Lake for water storage, but also to use the Huangdun Lake emergency reservoir to divert and store part of the Yi River. Currently, this area is intensively preparing for flood storage in Huangdun Lake. At the same time, the Provincial Flood Prevention and Drought Relief Headquarters urgently instructed Suining County to mobilize farmers in the Huangdun Lake area to take care of the overall situation and prioritize the overall interests over partial interests, harvest the ripe autumn crops, and prepare for water storage. After the autumn harvest, if the masses have difficulties in life, the government can provide assistance. It also instructed relevant departments to prepare ships for emergency rescue to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the people in Luoma Lake and Huangdun Lake.
    The water level of the Grand Canal in Hebei Province has also exceeded the safe water level, and breaches have occurred successively in Xiaodiwu, Nanxiakou and other places. Currently, leading cadres of the Cang County Special District are leading laborers to rush to close the breaches. Laborers are defending the sections of the Grand Canal in Shandong Province.
    Due to the heavy and concentrated rainfall in Northeast China since the beginning of summer, the flood season for the Songhua River and Liao River systems has arrived early. In particular, after the torrential rains on July 28th and 29th, the water level of the Liao River trunk stream has exceeded the guaranteed water level and approached the highest water level of 1951, causing the water levels of the Hun River, Liao River, and Taizi River to rise sharply. The person in charge of the Liaodong Provincial Flood Prevention Headquarters has led cadres to defend the Sancha River. The rising water level of the Hun River once threatened the urban and suburban areas of Shenyang. The Shenyang Municipal People's Government and the Northeast Regional Flood Prevention Headquarters and units of the Northeast Military Region mobilized urgently, organizing more than 1,500 people to carry out emergency repairs of dangerous works, finally overcoming the threat of water damage. Due to the large rainfall in the southern Liaoning area, the rivers rose sharply, and Liaozhong, Tai'an, Panshan, and Liaoyang counties have taken emergency action to respond to emergencies. In order to overcome water damage and safely pass the flood season, the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government assigned seven provincial department-level cadres to the counties along the river to lead flood prevention. The Northeast Regional Flood Prevention Headquarters has dispatched three teams to the Jiliu River in the Liao River, the Hun River in Liaozhong, and the Hun River area in Liaoyang to lead farmers and masses in carrying out emergency response work.

    黄河、汉江、淮河水位先后猛涨
    各地干部和群众紧张护堤抢险
    【本报讯】八月初，黄河中游陕州以下的支流八里胡同、伊河、洛河、沁河等流域连降暴雨，黄河水位陡涨，花园口流量增多，为一九四九年以来的最大洪水高峰。沿河各地已采取了防汛紧急措施。
    河南省黄河防汛指挥部已派出干部分赴各险要地段，具体领导，帮助防汛工作。河南省人民政府领导干部也在三日冒雨上工地查看，指导防汛。中共河南省委、省人民政府并指示沿黄河各专区、县应把防汛工作作为一切工作的中心，要求各级负责干部及防汛人员立即上堤，亲自掌握，组织群众日夜守护堤防、掌握险工，确保沿河人民生命财产的安全。中共郑州地委书记张健民，开封、东明、中牟等县的负责干部都已上堤，准备抢险；各险工段的群众都准备好一切抢险需用的工具和物料，昼夜监视水情。中共新乡地委也发出了防汛指示。指示要求各县把防汛、排水、滞洪等工作作为目前压倒一切的中心，专派干部深入防汛、滞洪任务重的区、村，组织发动群众，检查防汛、抢险、滞洪等一切准备工作。
    在同一时期，黄河下游由于黄河和汶河河水并涨，七日晚艾山孙口（山东省东阿县）水位已超过一九四九年最大洪水位。山东省除派出负责干部到菏泽、聊城两专区帮助防汛外，省人民政府副主席晁哲甫、中共中央山东分局秘书长张辑五等也都曾先后上堤视察，指示有关防汛事宜。历城县、章历县抽调了六十多名干部到黄河堤，投入紧张的防汛工作。菏泽段自八月二日晚到六日曾动员了两万人，三百多技术干部，和洪水激烈搏斗四昼夜，终于保住了大堤的安全。
    汉江、淮河水位也不断上涨。湖北省荆州专区发出紧急指示，要求防汛民工带工具、雨具上堤，堤外滩地立即抢收庄稼。八日，汉江岳口至仙桃段已超出保证水位。荆州专区五县目前共有十二万人护堤抢险。八月五日淮河干流蚌埠水位已迫近警戒水位，支流颍河阜阳水位已超过警戒水位一点七四公尺，并继续上涨。涡河亳县水位超过警戒水位零点六八公尺。各地现正在紧急抢守中。
    七月下旬以来山东省沂蒙山区连续大雨，沂河洪水暴发，沂河水位逐渐上涨。到八月四日上午九时，山东临沂的水位、流量已超过历史上最高纪录。除了一部分沂水流到武河、沭河以外，大量沂水奔腾南下到江苏境内。江苏省防汛抗旱指挥部分析了洪水的来量和可能发展的趋势，准备除用骆马湖蓄水以外，并利用黄墩湖非常水库分蓄一部分沂水。目前这一地区正在紧张进行黄墩湖蓄洪的准备工作。同时省防汛抗旱指挥部紧急指示睢寗县动员黄墩湖区域农民照顾全局，以部分利益服从整体利益，抢收已熟的秋季作物，准备蓄水。秋收以后，假使群众生活有困难，政府还可给予扶助。并指示有关部门准备船只以备紧急抢救，以保障骆马湖、黄墩湖人民生命财产的安全。
    河北省境内南运河水位也超出安全水位，小弟五、南霞口等处先后决口，目前沧县专区领导干部正在率领民工抢堵。在山东省境内的南运河堤段，都有民工防守。
    东北由于入夏以来雨水多而且集中，松花江水系、辽河水系汛期都提早来临，特别是七月二十八、二十九两日暴雨后，辽河干流水位已超过保证水位而接近于一九五一年最高水位，引起浑河、辽河、太子河各河水位猛涨。辽东省防汛总指挥部负责人已率领干部前往三岔河防守。浑河水位上涨，曾一度威胁沈阳市区及郊区。沈阳市人民政府及东北区防汛总指挥部、东北军区等机关部队紧张动员起来，组织一千五百余人，全力进行险工抢补工作，终于战胜了水害威胁。辽南地区因雨水较大，各河猛涨，辽中、台安、盘山、辽阳各县已紧急行动起来进行抢险。辽西省人民政府为了战胜水害，安全渡过汛期，分派七个省的厅长级干部赴沿河各县领导防汛。东北区防汛总指挥部已派出三个小组，分赴辽河的巨流河、辽中境内的浑河、辽阳境内的浑河地区领导农民群众进行抢险工作。
