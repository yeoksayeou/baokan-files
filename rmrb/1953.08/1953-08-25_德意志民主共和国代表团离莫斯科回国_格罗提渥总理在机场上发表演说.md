Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Moscow, August 24th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Premier Otto Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic delivered a speech at the airport upon leaving Moscow, the full text of which is as follows:

Dear friends!

Today, as the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic is about to depart, I, on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic and all patriotic German people, express our heartfelt gratitude to the people of Moscow, the beautiful, courageous, and vibrant capital of the great Soviet Union, to all the people of the Soviet Union, and to the Soviet government. We thank everyone, especially the Soviet government, for the warm, fraternal reception given to our delegation, and for their friendly care and consideration.

The government of the German Democratic Republic, representing the German people, welcomes with great satisfaction the communique on the talks between the governments of our two peoples, and the protocols signed yesterday on the cessation of reparation payments by Germany and on other measures to alleviate the financial and economic obligations borne by the German Democratic Republic as a result of the war.

The agreements contained in these two documents usher in a new era in the friendly relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and a new stage in the German people's struggle for their vital national interests.

The government of the German Democratic Republic believes that these decisions demonstrate the Soviet government's firm determination to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, and for this purpose, to immediately implement in the German Democratic Republic the measures it has proposed for all of Germany: a substantial reduction of burdens.

This decision is a major economic assistance to the German Democratic Republic and a concrete support to the national struggle of all German people for a peaceful solution to the German question along democratic lines.

The cessation of reparations from Germany; the abolition of debts; the free transfer of enterprises of Soviet joint-stock companies within Germany; the further reduction of occupation costs; the cessation of the collection of occupation costs debts accumulated since 1945 and payable in foreign currency; the sale of goods worth 590 million rubles beyond the provisions of existing trade agreements; the granting of a loan of 485 million rubles – all these prove the Soviet government's selfless and friendly assistance to the German people. This great support alleviates the consequences of the division of Germany caused by the Western countries, provides the possibility for a rapid improvement in the living standards of the people of the German Democratic Republic, and encourages the German people's struggle against militarism, fascism, and the threat of war. Our talks have encouraged the struggle for a peaceful, democratic unification of Germany, and for the conclusion of a peace treaty.

As we leave your magnificent land, the land of workers and peasants, we assure you that we will also do everything possible at home to strengthen the struggle of the peace camp and to achieve victory.

The government of the German Democratic Republic, on behalf of all peace-loving German people, expresses its heartfelt gratitude for the genuinely friendly assistance of the Soviet government.

Farewell, dear friends and comrades!

    德意志民主共和国代表团离莫斯科回国
    格罗提渥总理在机场上发表演说
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：以德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团，在二十三日离莫斯科回国。
    到中央机场欢送的有：苏联部长会议第一副主席兼苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫、苏联部长会议副主席兼苏联国内和对外贸易部部长阿·伊·米高扬、苏联部长会议国家计划委员会主席马·扎·萨布罗夫及苏联政府其他高级官员。
    到机场欢送的还有德意志民主共和国及各人民民主国家驻苏联外交使节。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日电：德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥在离开莫斯科时在机场上发表演说，全文如下：亲爱的朋友们！
    今天，在德意志民主共和国政府代表团即将离去的时候，我代表德意志民主共和国政府以及全体德国爱国人民，向伟大苏联的美丽的、勇往直前的、生气勃勃的首都——莫斯科的人民，向苏联全体人民以及苏联政府表示最衷心的感谢。我们感谢所有的人，特别是苏联政府给予我们代表团的热情的、兄弟般的接待，感谢他们友好的关怀与照顾。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表德国人民，极为满意地欢迎关于我们两国人民的政府之间的会谈的公报，以及双方昨日签订的关于德国停止支付赔偿费、关于减轻德意志民主共和国由于战争的结果而承担的财政、经济义务的其它措施的议定书。
    这两个文件中所载的协议使德意志民主共和国与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟之间的友好关系进入了新时期，使德国人民争取他们的切身民族利益的斗争进入了新阶段。
    德意志民主共和国政府认为，这些决定说明苏联政府有坚定的决心从速缔结和约，并为了这个目的，立刻对德意志民主共和国实行它建议对全德实行的措施：大量减轻负担。
    这个决定是对德意志民主共和国的一个重大的经济援助，是对全体德国人民争取本着民主方针和平解决德国问题的民族斗争的具体支持。
    停止自德国收取赔偿费；废除债务；无偿地移交德国境内的苏联股份公司的企业；进一步减少占领费；停止自德国收取自一九四五年以来所积欠的以外币支付的占领费债务；超过现有的贸易协定的规定，多卖给价值达五亿九千万卢布的货物；给予四亿八千五百万卢布的贷款——这一切都证明了苏联政府对德国人民的无私的、友谊的援助。这种伟大的支援减轻了西方国家所造成的德国分裂局面的后果，为迅速提高德意志民主共和国人民的生活水平提供了可能性，鼓舞了德国人民反对军国主义、法西斯主义和战争威胁的斗争。我们的会谈鼓舞了争取德国的和平、民主统一、争取缔结和约的斗争。
    在离开你们辉煌壮丽的国土、工人和农民的国土时，我们向你们保证，我们在国内也将尽一切可能加强和平阵营的斗争，并获得胜利。
    德意志民主共和国政府代表所有爱好和平的德国人民，对苏联政府真正友谊的援助表示由衷的感激。
    再会了，亲爱的朋友们和同志们！
