Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 25th: The "Pravda" published on August 25th a New York dispatch by Filippov, entitled "The United States' Policy of Dictating Orders Does Not Work." He summarized the results of the first week of work of the Third Session of the Seventh United Nations General Assembly. This session was convened to formulate recommendations regarding the organization of a political conference for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. In the debate in the Political Committee, two closely related issues attracted the attention of the representatives: What should be the form of this conference? Which countries should participate in this conference? Currently, there are two clearly different attitudes towards the resolution of these two issues.

Filippov said that, on the one hand, the Soviet delegation, guided by the principles of the Soviet Union's unwavering peaceful foreign policy, proposed in the Political Committee a proposal stipulating that the conference be organized according to the "round table conference" principle recognized by international diplomatic practice. In other words, the Soviet Union's suggestion proceeds from the consideration that if the political conference includes not only the representatives of the belligerent parties in the Korean War, but also the representatives of countries concerned about a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, then the conference can most smoothly complete its task.

On the other hand, the United States delegation has tried its best to force the General Assembly to accept a recommendation that would limit the members of the political conference to only the countries participating in the Korean War. As for the political conference itself, according to the US plan, it should be a bilateral meeting composed according to the "belligerent parties" principle.

Filippov continued that this position of the US ruling clique was opposed by Britain, France, and most other countries. According to newspaper reports, these delegations pointed out that without the participation of the Soviet Union in the upcoming political conference, no important issues could be resolved.

Filippov continued that the majority of representatives who have spoken have, in one form or another, expressed their support for organizing the political conference according to the "round table conference" principle.

British representative Lloyd said that Britain was unwilling to support the concept of opposing sides and was unwilling to have the peace conference become a political Panmunjom.

French representative Maurice Schuman said that he hoped the conference would not be composed of opposing sides; on the contrary, the conference should be able to pave the way for a common discussion of contentious issues.

Representatives from Canada, Norway, and other countries expressed the same views on the nature of the upcoming conference in the Political Committee.

Since the US delegation's attempt to impose its will on the General Assembly has met with increasing resistance, the American bourgeois newspapers have sharply attacked the United Nations in recent days, sometimes even openly scolding the United Nations. However, here, this attack is nothing new. This attack appears whenever the US policy of dictating orders begins to fail in the United Nations.

    “真理报”载文综述七届联大第三期会议一周情况
    美国操纵联合国的政策遭到强有力的抗拒
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：“真理报”二十五日刊载费利波夫的纽约通讯，题目是“美国发号施令的政策行不通了”。他综述了联合国第七届大会第三期会议第一周工作的结果。这一期会议是为了拟订关于组织和平解决朝鲜问题的政治会议的建议而召开的。在政治委员会的辩论中，吸引代表们注意的是两个密切相关的问题：这个会议的形式应该是怎么样的？哪一些国家应该参加这个会议？目前，对于这两个问题的解决，有两种显然不同的态度。
    费利波夫说，一方面，以苏联坚持不渝的和平外交政策的原则为指针的苏联代表团在政治委员会提出了一个提案，规定根据国际外交惯例所公认的“圆桌会议”原则来组织会议。换言之，苏联建议是从这种考虑出发的：如果政治会议不仅包括朝鲜战争交战双方的代表，而且也包括关心朝鲜问题得到和平解决的国家的代表，那末，这个会议就可以最顺利地完成它的任务。
    另一方面，美国代表团竭力强使大会接受这样的建议，即：把政治会议的成员仅限于参加朝鲜战争的国家。至于政治会议本身，根据美国的计划，它应该是根据“交战双方”原则组成的双方会议。
    费利波夫接着说，美国统治集团的这种立场遭到了英国、法国和大多数其他国家的反对。据报纸上的消息说，这些代表团指出，在即将举行的政治会议中如果没有苏联参加，就不能解决任何重要问题。
    费利波夫接着说，已经发言的大多数代表用这种形式或那种形式赞成根据“圆桌会议”原则来组织政治会议。
    英国代表劳埃德说，英国不愿支持对立双方的概念，不愿和平会议变成政治上的板门店会议。
    法国代表莫里斯·舒曼说，希望会议不要由对立双方组成，相反地，会议要能为共同讨论争执中的问题铺平道路。
    加拿大、挪威和其他国家的代表在政治委员会上对即将召开的会议的性质都表示了同样的观点。
    由于美国代表团把它的意志强加于大会的企图遭到了日益增长的抗拒，美国资产阶级报纸在最近几天中尖锐地攻击联合国，有时甚至对联合国公开谩骂。然而在这里，这种攻击并不是什么新奇的事情。每当美国发号施令政策在联合国中开始行不通的时候，这种攻击就出现了。
