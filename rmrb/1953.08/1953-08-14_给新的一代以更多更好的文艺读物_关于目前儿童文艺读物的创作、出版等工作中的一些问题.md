Give the New Generation More and Better Literary Readings
—Some Problems in the Creation, Publication, and Other Work of Current Children's Literary Readings
Zhong Luo

The young people are constantly asking teachers, newspapers, periodicals, and the cultural and publishing circles for more and better literary readings. They are dissatisfied with the current literary readings. This request is completely justified.

In recent years, we have published many children's books. According to incomplete statistics from the Central People's Government Publishing Administration, from 1950 to 1952, more than 2,300 kinds of children's books were published nationwide, with more than 41.6 million copies (excluding picture story books). Among them, there are also some relatively good literary readings. Such as the novels "The Story of Luo Wenyin" (Zhang Tianyi), "Volunteer Army Uncles and Korean Little Girls" (Wei Wei), etc.; stories "Lu Xun and His Childhood Friends" (Feng Xuefeng), "The Little Swallow's Long Flight" (Qin Zhaoyang), "Iron Doll" (Li Boning), etc.; poems "Chairman Mao's Little Hero" (Ke Zhongping), "I Really Want to Join the Team" (Jin Jin), etc.; play "Rongsheng at Home" (Zhang Tianyi), etc.; picture story books "Chicken Feather Letter" (Hua Shan), "Brother Hou and His Young Pioneers" (Yu Jin), etc. These works are loved by the vast number of children. However, these achievements are too disproportionate to the actual needs. Generally speaking, the progress in the creation and publication of children's literary readings is too slow, and there are still considerable backward and chaotic phenomena.

The Children's Literature Group of the All-China Federation of Literary Workers recently sampled more than 280 kinds of children's literary readings published after liberation. Among them, the good or relatively good ones (educational, with a considerable artistic level, and loved by children) are less than twenty kinds. The rest either violate the educational principles of New China to a certain extent, or do not truthfully reflect the new life of children; or are written in a dull, formulaic way; and some of the texts are ungrammatical. Some even caused confusion in children's minds or had a bad impact on children's psychology.

For example: "Little Communist Party Member," published by Tianjin Knowledge Bookstore and written by Bi Ye, tells the story of a small communicator in the army who has hooligan habits, violates discipline, beats and scolds people, is lazy and mischievous, and is finally approved to join the party because he carries back the wounded battalion commander on the battlefield. This book, which seriously distorts the image of the revolutionary army and the image of the Communist Party members, has a very bad influence on children. Another example is "Anti-American Aggression Fables," published by Shanghai Guangmang Publishing House and written by He Gongchao, which is actually a rewrite of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" called "The Cunning Wolf." One of the articles, "The Shepherd's Clever Plan," uses the story of two shepherds who caught two wolf cubs and hid them in a tree, making the old wolf run back and forth, and killing it when it was exhausted, to compare today's anti-imperialist struggle; after telling the clever plan of the two shepherds, the author said that if the third world war breaks out, as long as we do this and that, we can defeat American imperialism, etc. After a child read it, he asked the teacher: "Has the Third World War broken out?" This is the side effect of this "clever plan." Another example is "Deaf People's Congress," published by Shanghai Qiming Bookstore and written by He Yi. The article "Painted Skin" is also rewritten from "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," telling the story of a monster eating children, and the content is very terrifying. In the books about children's new life, they are full of struggle, confession, and criticism of this or that thought, doctrine, and so on.

From these books, we can see the backwardness and chaos of the current children's literary readings.

Why does this happen?

First, from the creative aspect. A major problem in children's literature creation is precisely what the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out in its 1941 decision on children's literature publishing: children's literature is divorced from the basic tasks of communist education for children. That's right, many works are not clear enough on the basic question of "what kind of thought to educate children with and how to educate them?" It is divorced from the five loves education principles stipulated in the "Common Program" and the creative principles of socialist realism, and instills some incorrect and unhealthy things into children.

Some of our children's literature writers are seriously divorced from the real life of children. They do not understand how much interest and great concern today's children show in all the new things and political events in the motherland and the world. They have not realized that the new character and qualities of the masters of the motherland's tomorrow are growing and maturing rapidly. They still wear the old glasses of ten or twenty years ago, and think that children's lives are just about cats and dogs fighting, listening to grandmothers telling stories, and so on. Or, they violate the characteristics of children and rigidly and dogmatically put everything of adults on children. The characters in some books are full of political terms and empty dogmas, without personality, let alone typical creation. The minds and horizons of our children's literature writers—who can be said to be the soul engineers of children—are in some respects less broad and enthusiastic than those of children.

The literary and art circles' concern for children's literature is also very insufficient. Here, one cannot help but think of the glorious example of the great Gorky and Mr. Lu Xun's attention to children's literature. Some of our writers' creative attitudes are not serious enough. They think that children's literary works are the easiest to write, so they write casually. It is said that some people can write one book a day; some people casually publish works from more than ten years ago, regardless of whether these works have educational significance or how much educational significance they have today. How can this careless and irresponsible attitude not contribute to the chaotic phenomenon in the publishing of children's literary readings?

Looking at the publishing aspect. Our state-owned publishing houses, joint state-private publishing houses, and a small number of private publishing houses have paid attention to and maintained the quality of publications to a certain extent, and published some children's literary readings and picture story books with relatively high ideological and artistic qualities. However, due to the difficulty of manuscript sources, they have not been able to publish more. China Youth Publishing House, People's Fine Arts Publishing House, and some private publishing houses have expressed in letters to the People's Daily that they hope to get more help and support from professional and amateur writers and artists. This request should be accepted. So far, in terms of publishing, translation is still more than creation; this year's situation is better than in previous years, but creation is still too little. Children always ask: "Why do our writers create so little?"

However, the serious problem is not here, not just the problem of quantity. Many bookstores publish a large number of books with low quality or even errors. For example, the "Little Master Series" published by Shanghai Private Dadong Bookstore in 1950, which was quickly published by soliciting manuscripts in a short period of time, had many errors. Some bookstore owners seek profits by hook or by crook, using means of treating guests and giving gifts to win over some irresponsible authors to print books and make money. As for ideological education, they never consider it. Some bookstores are still publishing or reprinting those boring, vulgar, and even superstitious, monstrous, and erotic bad books published before liberation, and selling them to children. For example, Shanghai Children's Publishing House is still publishing folk song books that promote feudal superstition, promoting "committing crimes five hundred years ago, and not being able to escape them in this life" ("Washing Clothes"), and promoting a man marrying four wives ("Double-Headed Female Horse Abducting Men"). Some publishing houses in Shanghai are called "briefcase bookstores," that is to say, besides the owner's briefcase, there is nothing else, no editorial department, not even an address. But these "briefcase bookstores" are often publishing children's books.

Some cultural and publishing authorities have shown serious weaknesses in ideological leadership and administrative leadership. Some leading cadres simply regard ideological education for children as general administrative work, incorrectly understand freedom of publication, and ignore the serious task of educating the people (including children) with the ideology of the working class and communist ideology on the ideological front. They do not have enough understanding of the dangers of those "bourgeois habits, bourgeois commercial and business-minded publishing undertakings" (Lenin). For example, many bad comic strips circulating in Kunming City are stamped with the seal of approval of the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education. The Bureau of Culture and Education transferred the book review authority to the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce transferred it to the merchant group "Comic Book Rental United Guild," thus simply abandoning leadership and allowing a large number of harmful books to circulate legally among children.

There are also many problems in distribution. Xinhua Bookstore distributes thousands of children's books to all parts of the country every day through its branches. However, these large numbers of books also include some bad books; most of the erroneous and problematic books mentioned above were bought in Xinhua Bookstore. Children have no choice. As long as the bookstore has them, they think they are good. At the same time, Xinhua Bookstore's distribution work also has considerable blindness, and even there is a phenomenon of apportionment. In this way, in some areas, children's books are distributed to old men; while in more small and medium-sized cities and rural areas, children often cannot find the books they need. In some big cities, state-owned bookstores do not actively and regularly contact schools, cultural centers, and libraries to promote some better literary readings. We investigated the libraries of some primary schools in Beijing. Many good new books are not available, and their staff does not know which good books have been published. In the library of a certain primary school, there is "City and Years," but not books more suitable for children such as "Malyev at School and at Home."

Many teachers and people who care about children's literature have criticized the newspapers for introducing and criticizing too few children's literary books. This criticism is correct. General newspapers and periodicals have indeed not done enough in this regard. Even the China Youth Daily, which is the national newspaper for children, only introduced five books from the first issue to the eighty-ninth issue (published on July 13, 1953), and opened two recommended book lists during last year's winter vacation and this year's summer vacation. China Youth Daily has published some good creations, which are welcomed by children, but it is obviously too unable to meet the needs of children in introducing good books.

Due to serious shortcomings in distribution and promotion, bad books have replaced the good or relatively good children's literary readings in places where they have not occupied a large number of positions. In the current situation, the bookshops and book stalls that sell and rent old books and comic strips ("little people's books") have a considerable influence on children. A small part of these old books and comic strips are relatively good and have educational significance; but most of them are old (that is, published before liberation), and are full of superstitious, monstrous, and yellow toxins. This is the case from large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin to remote areas, small and medium-sized cities. In Kunming alone, there are 128 households renting comic strips, and more than 70% of the books rented are bad books. The influence of these old books and comic strips containing various toxins is astonishingly wide and deep. In some schools, all the students in some classes read them, and some children do not eat breakfast and save money to rent them at the book stalls. If they don't have money, they buy on credit, and even owe as much as 20,000 or 30,000 yuan.

There are few books in the school library, and even fewer new books; if extracurricular reading does not get correct guidance, then what power can stop children from going to the comic strip stalls and old bookshops to read indiscriminately? What power can stop those feudal, monstrous, and erotic toxins from eroding children's pure minds every moment? Children are enthusiastically searching for various models to imitate from all kinds of books. There are many examples like the following: A student from a primary school in Tianshui, Gansu Province, read "The Female Knight of the Wilderness" and abandoned the school and family to practice martial arts in the big forest; this happened twenty years ago, and it still happens today. A student from Jichuan Middle School in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, read "The Woman in the Tower" and daydreamed all day long, and was thus held back four times. Every student in the fifth grade of Tangfang Hutong Primary School in Xuanwu District, Beijing has a nickname. Influenced by bad books, some children organize secret groups and become sworn brothers; some do not observe order in class and do not listen to the teacher; some are awakened by nightmares at night and dare not walk on dark roads, and dare not go to the toilet at night; some bully female classmates, beat and scold people. Obviously, the influence of a bad book may offset a teacher's month of hard work. Many teachers are working hard in their own posts to put out these constantly encroaching toxins, protect the healthy development of the new generation psychologically and ideologically; and carefully and earnestly tell the children what they should read and how to read. However, there are also many teachers who watch indifferently as children are eroded by all kinds of toxins every day, watching children learn "Great Hero ××× is here" and remain indifferent, only caring about teaching their own books, as if imparting knowledge and cultivating good moral character are two unrelated things. Isn't this a strange phenomenon?

At present, there are more than 50 million primary and junior high school students in the country, and they urgently need healthy reading materials. However, as can be seen from the above, in terms of children's literary readings, which are important tools for cultivating children's new qualities and conducting communist education for children, there are phenomena that need to be improved in every link from creation, publication, publicity, distribution, promotion to guided reading. And these links are linked to each other and cannot be separated. The most important and decisive link is undoubtedly creation. Without a certain number of good works, everything is in vain. However, this does not mean that other links can reduce their responsibilities. If the publishing, distribution, and promotion work is not improved, what can be used to ensure that every good work can meet the children's readers? Therefore, to improve this situation, it requires the joint efforts of writers, publishers, the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations, teachers, counselors, and all relevant leading departments and the vast number of parents. Let everyone care about and attach importance to this work. Doing one more work for the new generation is to add one more force for the tomorrow of the motherland!

    给新的一代以更多更好的文艺读物
    ——关于目前儿童文艺读物的创作、出版等工作中的一些问题
    钟洛
    少年儿童们不断地向老师、向报刊、向文化界、出版界要求更多更好的文艺读物，他们对现在的文艺读物感到不满足。这种要求是完全正当的。
    几年来，我们出版了不少儿童读物。据中央人民政府出版总署的不完全统计，一九五○年至一九五二年这一时期，全国共出版少年儿童读物二千三百多种，四千一百六十多万册（不包括连环画册）。在这中间，也有一些比较优秀的文艺读物。如小说“罗文应的故事”（张天翼）、“志愿军叔叔和朝鲜小姑娘”（魏巍）等；故事“鲁迅和他少年时代的朋友”（冯雪峰）、“小燕子万里飞行记”（秦兆阳）、“铁娃娃”（李伯宁）等；诗歌“毛主席的小英雄”（柯仲平）、“我真想入队”（金近）等；剧本“蓉生在家里”（张天翼）等；连环画册“鸡毛信”（华山）、“侯哥弹和他的少年队”（余金）等。这些作品，都受到广大的少年儿童们的喜爱。但是，这些成绩跟实际的需要太不相称了。一般说来，在儿童文艺读物的创作和出版等方面，进步太慢，至今还存在着相当落后和混乱的现象。
    中华全国文学工作者协会儿童文学组，最近抽阅了解放后出版的儿童文艺读物二百八十余种。其中好的或较好的（有教育意义，有相当艺术水平，并为儿童所喜爱的），还不到二十种。其余的，不是在一定程度上违反了新中国的教育原则，就是不真实地表现了新的少年儿童的生活；或者是写得枯燥无味，公式化；还有的文字不通。有几种甚至引起了儿童混乱思想，或者对儿童心理产生了坏的影响。
    例如：天津知识书店出版、碧野著的“小共产党员”，写部队里一个有流氓习气的小通讯员，违反纪律，打人骂人，偷懒调皮，最后因为在战场上背回受伤的营长，被批准入党。这本严重歪曲革命部队、歪曲共产党员形象的书，给予儿童们极坏的影响。又如上海光芒出版社出版、何公超著的名为
    “抗美援朝寓言”实际是根据“聊斋”改写的“狡猾的狼”，其中一篇“牧羊人的妙计”，用了两个牧羊人捉了两只小狼躲在树上，使老狼来回奔走，趁它精疲力尽时打死它的故事，来譬喻今天的反帝国主义斗争；作者讲了这两个牧羊人的妙计以后，并说如果第三次世界大战爆发，我们只要如何如何，就可以战胜美帝国主义云云。有个孩子看了以后，就问老师：“第三次世界大战爆发了没有？”这就是这个“妙计”的副作用了。再如上海启明书局出版、贺宜著的“聋子大会”，其中“画皮”一篇，也是根据“聊斋”改写的，讲一个妖怪吃小孩子的故事，内容很恐怖。在写儿童新的生活的书里，则是充满了斗争、坦白、批判这个或那个思想、主义等等。
    从这些书里，可以看出目前儿童文艺读物的落后和混乱情况。
    为什么会产生这种情况呢？
    先从创作方面看。目前少年儿童文艺创作上的一个主要问题，正是苏联共产党中央委员会在一九四
    一年关于儿童文学出版工作的决定中所指责的：儿童文学脱离了儿童的共产主义教育的基本任务。正是这样，很多作品，在“用什么思想教育儿童和怎样教育？”这一基本问题上，是不够明确的。它脱离了“共同纲领”所规定的五爱教育原则，脱离了社会主义现实主义的创作原则，向儿童灌输了一些不正确、不健康的东西。
    我们的一些儿童文学作家，严重地脱离了儿童的现实生活。他们不理解今天的少年儿童对祖国和世界的一切新鲜事物、一切政治事件显示了多么浓厚的兴趣，多么巨大的关心。他们也没有体会到祖国明天的主人们的新的性格和品质正在飞快地成长和成熟。他们仍然戴着十年二十年前的老花眼镜，认为儿童的生活反正就是小猫小狗打架，听外婆讲故事等等。或者，就违反了儿童的特点，生硬地、教条地把成年人的一切套在儿童身上。有些书里的人物，满口政治名词和空洞的教条，没有性格，更谈不上典型的创造了。我们的儿童文学作家——可以说是儿童的灵魂工程师吧——的心胸和视野，在某些方面，甚至是不及儿童来得广阔和热情的。
    文艺界对儿童文学事业的关心，也是非常不够的。在这里，使人不得不想起伟大的高尔基和鲁迅先生重视儿童文学的光辉榜样。我们有些作家的创作态度是不够严肃的，他们以为儿童文艺作品最容易写，就随便写，据说有人一天就能写出一本来；有人把十多年前的作品随便地出版，也不管这些作品在今天有没有教育意义或者有多大的教育意义。这种草率从事、不负责任的态度，怎么能不助长儿童文艺读物出版工作中的混乱现象呢？
    再看出版方面。我们的公营出版社、公私合营出版社和少数的私营出版社在一定程度上注意和保持出版物的质量，出版了一些思想性和艺术性都比较高的儿童文艺读物和连环画册，但是，由于稿源困难，它们没有能出得更多。中国青年出版社、人民美术出版社和一些私营出版社在给人民日报的信里，都希望得到更多专业和业余的作家、画家的帮助和支持，这个要求是应该被接受的。到目前为止，在出版方面，还是翻译多于创作的；今年的情形比前几年好些，创作也还是太少。儿童们老是问：
    “为什么我们的作家创作得这样少呢？”
    然而，严重的问题还不在这里，还不只是数量的问题。不少书店出版了大量的内容低劣甚至有错误的书。如一九五○年上海私营大东书局出版的一套
    “小主人文库”，短时期约稿，很快出版，错误很多。有些书店老板唯利是图，用请客送礼的手段拉拢一些不负责任的作者，印书赚钱。至于思想教育等等，他们是从来不考虑的。某些书店到现在仍在出版或重印解放前出版的那些无聊、庸俗、甚至神怪、色情的坏书，向儿童读者推销。如上海儿童出版社，最近仍在出版宣传封建迷信的唱本，宣传“五百年前造下罪，来到今世躲不清”（“洗衣记”），宣传一个人娶了四个老婆（“双头马女拐男”）。上海有一些出版社是被称为“皮包书店”的，就是说，除了老板的一只皮包以外，其他什么也没有，没有编辑部，连地址也没有。但这种“皮包书店”，却经常在出版儿童读物。
    有些文化、出版主管部门在思想领导和行政领导工作上，都表现了严重弱点。某些领导干部，简单地把对少年儿童的思想教育工作看成一般的行政工作，不正确地理解出版自由，而忽视了在思想战线上应该以工人阶级思想、共产主义思想教育人民（自然也包括儿童在内）这一严重任务。对那些“资产阶级的习气，资产阶级营业性的、生意经的出版事业”（列宁）的危害性，是认识不足的。如昆明市流行的很多坏的连环图画，都盖有市文教局审查通过的图章。文教局把审书权移交工商局，而工商局又把它移交给商人集团“连环图书出租联合公会”，这样就索性放弃了领导，让大量有害的书合法地在儿童中流传了。
    在发行工作方面，也存在着很多问题。新华书店通过它的分支机构，每天把成千上万的儿童读物发行到全国各地去。但是，在这些大量的图书里，也包括了一些不好的书；前面所说的那些有错误、有问题的书，大部分就是在新华书店买到的。孩子没有选择力，只要书店里有的，他就认为是好的。同时，新华书店的发行工作也有相当大的盲目性，甚至还有摊派现象。这样，在某些地区，把儿童读物派到老大爷手里；而在更多的中小城市和农村，儿童们常常找不到他们所需要的读物。在一些大城市里，公营书店也没有主动地、经常地和学校联系，和文化馆、图书馆联系，推广一些比较好的文艺读物。我们调查了北京一些小学的图书馆，很多好的新书都没有，它们的工作人员也不知道有哪些好书出版。在某一个小学图书馆里，有“城与年”，但没有像“马列耶夫在学校和家里”这种更适合于儿童的书。
    许多教师和关心儿童文学事业的人，向报纸提出批评，说报纸、杂志对儿童文艺书籍的介绍和批评太少了。这种批评是正确的。一般报纸、刊物在这方面确实做得不够。甚至作为全国少年儿童自己的报纸的中国少年报，从第一期到第八十九期（一九五三年七月十三日出版）为止，一共只介绍过五本书，在去年寒假和今年暑假时开过两回推荐书单。中国少年报曾发表过一些好的创作，为少年儿童们所欢迎，但在介绍好书方面，显然是太不能满足少年儿童的需要了。
    由于发行、推广工作上存在着严重的缺点，在好的或较好的儿童文艺读物没有占领大量阵地的地方，坏的书便代替了它们。以目前的情况说，在少年儿童中起相当大的影响的，是出卖和出租旧书和连环画册（“小人书”）的书铺和书摊。这些旧书和连环画册中，有小部分是比较好的，有教育意义的；但大部分是旧的（即解放以前出版的），充满了迷信、神怪、黄色的毒素的。从北京、上海、天津等大城市到边远地区、中小城市，都是如此。在昆明一地，出租连环画册的有一百二十八户，出租的书百分之七十以上是坏书。这些含有各种毒素的旧书和连环画册的影响之广和深，是惊人的。有些学校里有些班级全班人人都看，有的孩子不吃早点，省下钱到书摊去租，没有钱就赊账，甚至欠到两三万元之多。
    学校里图书馆的书少，新书更少；课外阅读要是又得不到正确的辅导，那么，有什么力量可以阻止少年儿童们自己到小人书摊、旧书铺去乱看呢？有什么力量可以阻止那些封建的、神怪的、色情的毒素，每时每刻地侵蚀儿童们的纯洁的心灵呢？少年儿童们热情地从各种各样的书本中去找寻各种各样的摹仿的榜样。下面这样的事例是很多的：甘肃天水分区某完全小学有个学生，看了“荒江女侠”，抛弃学校和家庭，到大树林里练武去了；这种事二十年前发生过，今天仍然发生。四川成都济川中学一个学生看了“塔里的女人”，成天胡思乱想，因而留级四次。北京市宣武区糖房胡同小学五年级全班每人都有绰号。孩子们受了坏书的影响，有的组织秘密团体，拜把结社；有的上课不守秩序，不听老师的话；有的晚上被恶梦吓醒，不敢走黑路，晚上不敢上厕所；有的欺侮女同学，打人骂人。很明显，一本坏书的影响，也许可以抵消了教师一个月的辛勤工作。有不少教师，正在自己的工作岗位上，努力扑灭这些不断侵袭来的毒素，保护新生一代心理上思想上的健康发展；并且细心地、认真地在告诉孩子们应该阅读些什么和怎样去阅读。但是，也有不少教师，眼看着孩子们每天受着各色各样毒素的侵蚀而无动于衷，眼看着孩子们学着“大侠×××来也”而若无其事，只管教自己的书，好像传授知识和培养优良的道德品质是不相干的两回事，这不是很奇怪的现象么？
    目前全国小学生和初中学生，已达五千万人以上，他们迫切需要健康的读物。但是，从上面可以看出，在作为培养儿童新的品质、向儿童进行共产主义教育的重要工具的少年儿童文学读物方面，从创作、出版、宣传、发行、推广直到辅导阅读的过程中，每一个环节上都存在着亟待改进的现象。而这些环节，是一环扣着一环，分不开的。其中最主要的、有决定性意义的一环，毫无疑问，是创作。没有一定数量的好的作品，什么都落了空。但是，这样说，并不能意味着其他的环节可以减轻它的责任。出版、发行、推广工作不改进，用什么来保证每一部好的作品都能和儿童读者见面呢？因此，要改进这种情况，就需要作家、出版家、青年团和少年先锋队的组织、教师、辅导员、以及一切有关领导部门和广大的家长们的共同努力。让大家都来关心和重视这件工作吧。为新生的一代多做一分工作，就是为祖国的明天增加一分力量！
