On the eve of August 23, 1953—the ninth anniversary of the glorious Soviet army liberating our country from fascist enslavement and the laboring people overthrowing the fascist dictatorship under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party—the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China held a film screening, showing the first Romanian film dubbed in Chinese, "For a Better Life." At the same time, the China Film Distribution Company also distributed this film to many cinemas in Chinese cities.

The screening of the film "For a Better Life" on the eve of this greatest festival of the Romanian people is of special significance. After our country gained liberation, the Romanian people were able to take control of their own destiny, smash the power of the exploiting classes, and, with the multifaceted assistance of the Soviet Union, first embark on the road of restoring the national economy, and then embark on the road of building socialism. At the same time, a profound cultural revolution took place, which affected all aspects of cultural activities, including our country's film production.

In all areas of this cultural revolution, Soviet assistance has been and continues to be invaluable. In the film industry, this assistance is particularly necessary and particularly effective. The young film industry of the People's Republic of Romania is a fruit of Romanian-Soviet friendship.

The screening of this film also has a significant meaning. It is the first Romanian feature film dubbed in Chinese to be introduced to the vast film audience of the People's Republic of China. This Chinese dubbing of the film is an important step forward in the road of constantly consolidating the fraternal relations between the Romanian people and the great Chinese people. This film has its own language, the language of images. It is an excellent tool for promoting mutual understanding among the laboring people of the countries in the peace and democracy camp, and an excellent tool for educating them in the spirit of internationalism and strengthening their unity in the common struggle. The films produced by the People's Republic of China, which have a high artistic level and great mobilizing power and are warmly welcomed by the Romanian laboring people, as well as the films of the People's Republic of Romania that have been shown in various mass organizations in the People's Republic of China, enable the vast audiences of both countries to more deeply understand the unity of their efforts, their desires, and their ideals.

In the past, Romania was one of the most backward countries in terms of film production, its production being limited to a few newsreels. There were no film schools, no film studios, no film equipment manufacturing enterprises, and no film actors.

Only under the people's democratic regime, thanks to the large-scale and multifaceted assistance from the Soviet Union in terms of experts, equipment, and documentary materials, were the first achievements made in this field. Studios with modern equipment were established, namely the "Alexandru Sahia" film studio, which specializes in producing documentaries, and the "Bucharest" film studio, which produces feature films. A secondary film school was established, as well as a four-year film academy divided into three departments: film directing, film acting, and film technology. A large number of talented Romanian youths can go to the world's best film school, the Soviet film school, the Moscow Film Institute, to study and be trained. With the help of the Soviet Union, the first "Film Production Planning Bureau" was established to plan the equipment necessary for the film industry. In addition, a factory was established specifically to manufacture the machinery and equipment necessary for film production. Soviet experts also helped us in the production of the first color film.

The young film industry of the People's Republic of Romania has produced several feature films, which have been warmly welcomed in our country and in fraternal countries. One of them, "The Ideal is Realized" (i.e., "Mitrea Cocor"—translator's note), won the "Award for the Struggle for Social Progress" at the 7th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. The films produced by the People's Republic of Romania show the creative enthusiasm of the youth on major construction sites in the country, such as "Echoes of the Valley." They show the miserable lives of our country's laboring peasants in the past who were exploited by landlords and rich peasants, as well as the struggle for the socialist transformation of the countryside after liberation and land reform, such as "In Our Village" and "The Ideal is Realized." The theme of "For a Better Life"—the first film of the People's Republic of Romania dubbed in Chinese—is the struggle of the working class against imperialist spies and saboteurs, and the profound change in the hearts of upright scientists who contribute their research results to the service of the laboring people.

The documentaries produced by the People's Republic of Romania are loved and praised by the laboring people of our country, because these films appropriately depict the image of the struggle to discover the wealth hidden in the land, in the waterfalls, and in the barren land, to build hydroelectric power stations, new cities, and new factories, and to build a new life under the leadership of the socialist builders in our country. Documentaries such as "One Minute," "Forest," "Ninth World University Games," "Danube Delta," "Danube-Black Sea Canal," "Cement," "The Struggle for Electrification," "Children's Palace," "Baia Mare Integrated Enterprise," "The Road to Prosperity," "Happy Days," "Romanian Liberation Day," and "Building Socialist Agriculture" are powerful tools for educating the laboring masses of the People's Republic of Romania in patriotism. Several of these films will be dubbed by the film studios of the People's Republic of China.

The Buftea Film Studio, which is currently under construction, provides enormous possibilities for the development of the Romanian film industry. In this regard, Soviet assistance is also extremely valuable. The architectural drawings of the main buildings of the studio were designed by Soviet experts. The Soviet Union also provided superior, modern technical equipment. The design of the remaining parts of the building and its actual work were done by Romanian experts. Various combined machines, machines, and equipment are manufactured in the People's Republic of Romania.

This film center—one of the largest film centers in Europe—will cover an area of ​​thirty hectares, on which thirty rows of houses will be built, four studios equipped with the latest technology, and will be able to produce twelve feature films and many scientific documentaries every year.

This year, a part of this integrated film factory (namely a large-scale photography studio and a small studio of one of the four studios, as well as their auxiliary factories and affiliated buildings) will begin to produce feature films.

The several new films currently being produced by the studios of the People's Republic of Romania either depict various aspects of the people's new life, or describe the glorious chapters of the revolutionary struggle in the past, or commemorate the lives of great men of letters and scientists of the 19th century. The feature film "Ionutz's Work Team" faithfully depicts the life and efforts of our coal miners. "The Trumpeter's Grandson" is the history of a poor peasant family since the end of the 1877 War of Independence. In this war, the Russian army and the Romanian army fought side by side against the Turkish Empire, which had oppressed our country for hundreds of years. The content of this film extends until the liberation of Romania by the Soviet army and our country's embarking on the road to building socialism. "Balcescu" depicts the Romanian revolutionary leader and great democrat of 1848. Other films will depict the lives of Eminescu, the brilliant poet of the Romanian people, Caragiale, the great satirist of bourgeois society, and Aurel Vlaicu, our country's first airplane manufacturer.

During the Five-Year Plan period (1951 to 1955), the film industry of the People's Republic of Romania will produce a total of eighteen feature films, four hundred and ninety newsreels, and one hundred and twenty-two documentaries.

With the rapid development of the film industry in the People's Republic of Romania, the work of exchanging films with fraternal countries has also been strengthened and expanded.

The vast film audience of the People's Republic of Romania greatly appreciates and loves Chinese films, because they see a reflection of their own thoughts and struggles in the wishes, thoughts, and struggles of the new heroes in Chinese films. (Xinhua News Agency)

    罗马尼亚人民共和国年青的电影事业的生长和发展
    罗马尼亚驻华大使馆一等秘书  孟天努
    一九五三年八月二十三日——光荣的苏军把我国从法西斯奴役下解放出来、以及劳动人民在罗马尼亚工人党领导下推翻法西斯独裁政权的九周年——前夕，中华人民共和国中央人民政府文化部举办了一次电影放映，放映第一部华语配音的罗马尼亚影片“为了美好的生活”。同时，中国电影发行公司也将这部影片分发到中国各城市的许多电影院放映。
    影片“为了美好的生活”在罗马尼亚人民的这个最伟大的节日的前夕放映，是具有特别意义的。在我们的国家获得解放以后，罗马尼亚人民能够掌握自己的命运，粉碎剥削阶级的政权，并在苏联的多方面援助下，首先开始走上恢复国民经济的道路，接着就走上建设社会主义的道路。同时，一个深刻的文化革命发生了，这个革命影响到文化活动的各方面，包括我国的影片生产在内。
    在这种文化革命的一切领域内，苏联的援助曾经是并继续是非常宝贵的，在电影工业方面，这种援助特别必要、特别有效。罗马尼亚人民共和国的年青的电影工业是罗、苏友谊的果实。
    这一影片的放映还有一个重大的意义。它是以华语配音介绍给中华人民共和国广大的电影观众的第一部罗马尼亚故事片。在不断巩固罗马尼亚人民与伟大中国人民之间的兄弟关系的道路上，这部影片的华语配音是重要的推进的一步。这部影片有它自己的语言，形象的语言，它是促进和平民主阵营各国的劳动人民的互相了解的出色的工具，是以国际主义精神教育他们、加强他们在共同斗争中的团结的出色的工具。具有高度艺术水平和伟大的动员力量、受到罗马尼亚劳动人民热烈欢迎的中华人民共和国所摄制的影片，以及曾在中华人民共和国各群众组织中放映的罗马尼亚人民共和国影片，使得两国的广大的观众能够更深刻地了解他们的努力、他们的愿望和他们的理想的一致性。
    在过去，在影片生产方面，罗马尼亚是最落后的国家之一，它的生产只限于个别几部新闻片。没有电影学校，没有制片厂，没有电影设备生产企业，没有电影演员。
    只是在人民民主政权下，由于苏联在专家、设备、纪录材料方面的大规模的、多方面的帮助，在这一领域内才获得了第一批的成就。有新式设备的制片厂建立起来了，这就是专门生产纪录片的“亚历山德鲁·萨希亚”电影制片厂和生产故事片的“布加勒斯特”电影制片厂。中等电影学校设立起来了，并设立了一个分为三部——电影导演，电影演员和电影技师——的四年制电影学院。很大一批有天才的罗马尼亚青年可以到世界上最好的电影学校，即苏联的电影学校，到莫斯科电影研究所去学习，去受训练。在苏联的帮助下，开办了第一个“电影摄制计划局”，以计划影片工业所必需的设备。此外还建立了一个专门制造影片生产所必需的机械和设备的工厂。在第一部五彩影片的生产过程中，苏联专家也给我们以帮助。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的年青的电影工业生产了几部故事片，这些影片在我国以及兄弟国家都受到热烈的欢迎。其中一部，“理想实现了”（即“米特里亚·柯可尔”—译注）曾在卡罗维·发利举行的第七届国际电影节上获得“争取社会进步斗争奖”。罗马尼亚人民共和国摄制的影片显示了国内各大建筑工地的青年的创造热情，例如“山谷回响”。它们显示了我国的劳动农民过去受地主和富农剥削的可怜的生活以及解放和土地改革后农村中进行的农村社会主义改造的斗争，例如“在我们村子里”和“理想实现了”。“为了美好的生活”——第一部有华语配音的罗马尼亚人民共和国影片——的主题是工人阶级所领导的反对帝国主义间谍和破坏的斗争以及贡献他们的研究成果为劳动人民服务的正直的科学家的内心的深刻变化。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国摄制的纪录片受到我国劳动人民的热爱和赞扬，因为这些影片适当地表现了在我国社会主义建设者的领导下，为发掘隐藏在土地中、瀑布中和荒芜土地上的财富，为建设水电站、新城市和新工厂，为建设新生活而进行斗争的形象。如“一分钟”、“森林”、“世界大学游戏第九版”、“多瑙河三角洲”、“多瑙河——黑海运河”、“水泥”、“争取电气化的斗争”、“少年宫”、“巴伊阿·马雷综合企业”、“富裕的道路”、“快乐的日子”、“罗马尼亚的解放日”、“建设社会主义农业”等记录片是使罗马尼亚人民共和国的劳动群众受到爱国主义教育的效能强大的工具。其中有几部影片将在中华人民共和国的制片厂翻译配音。
    目前正在建设中的布弗齐阿电影制片厂为罗马尼亚电影事业的发展提供了巨大的可能性。在这一方面，苏联的帮助也是极其宝贵的。制片厂主要建筑物的建筑图样是由苏联专家设计的。苏联还供给上等的新式技术设备。建筑的其余部分的设计及其实际工作是由罗马尼亚专家做的。各种组合机器、机器和设备是在罗马尼亚人民共和国制造的。
    这个电影中心——欧洲最大的电影中心之一——将占地三十公顷，其中将建造三十排房屋，四个按照最新式的技术装备起来的制片厂，每年能摄制十二部故事影片及许多科学记录片。
    今年，这个综合制片工厂的一部分（即一个大规模的摄影场和四个制片厂中的一个小型制片厂，以及它们的辅助工厂和附属建筑物）将开始摄制故事片。
    目前正在罗马尼亚人民共和国制片厂摄制的几部新影片，或是刻划人民新生活的各个方面，或是描述过去革命斗争中光荣的篇章，或是纪念十九世纪伟大的文人和科学家的生活。故事片“伊奥努茨兹的工作队”，忠实地刻划了我们煤矿工人的生活和他们的努力。“喇叭手的孙子”是一个贫农家庭从一八七七年独立战争结束以来的历史。在这个战争中，俄国军队和罗马尼亚军队并肩和压迫了我国几百年的土耳其帝国作战。这部影片的内容直到苏军解放罗马尼亚和我国走上建设社会主义的道路为止。“巴尔切斯库”刻划了罗马尼亚一八四八年的革命领袖、伟大的民主主义者。其他几部影片将刻划罗马尼亚人民的天才诗人艾米尼斯库、资产阶级社会的伟大讽刺家卡拉德盖勒和我国第一个飞机制造者奥雷尔·弗拉伊库等人的生活。
    在五年计划期间（一九五一年到一九五五年）罗马尼亚人民共和国的电影工业总共将摄制十八部故事片、四百九十部新闻片和一百二十二部纪录片。
    随着罗马尼亚人民共和国电影事业的迅速发展，与兄弟国家交换影片的工作也加强了并扩大了。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国广大的电影观众非常赞扬和热爱中国影片，因为他们在中国影片的新英雄的愿望、思想和斗争中看到了他们自己的思想和斗争的反映。                    （新华社）
