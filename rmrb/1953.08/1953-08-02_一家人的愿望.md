To the Soldiers

A Family's Wishes

Editor's Note: Yang Shuqin is from Xiwajie, Zhufang Administrative Village, Haidian District, Beijing. Her husband, Wang Tongxi, volunteered to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in 1951. Thanks to the education she received from the Party and the People's Government, and the encouragement from her husband's letters, she has made rapid progress and has been selected as a model agricultural laborer and a model military dependent in Beijing. This is a letter she wrote to her husband after hearing about the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Dear Comrade Tongxi:

On the morning of July 29th, I went to the village government for some business. Village Chief Yang Xiuming grabbed me and said, "Comrade Shuqin, I have good news for you." Usually, the people in the village like to joke with me, so I thought he was joking again and ignored him. But then he said, "Have you heard? We twisted the enemy's neck and they signed the armistice agreement with us!" Tongxi, can you guess how I felt at that moment? I thought, "This time you should be coming back, to participate in our country's great construction, and the whole family can have a reunion dinner!..." But then another thought crossed my mind, and I remembered the last agreement we signed with the enemy regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war. It was a clearly agreed-upon matter, but the enemy quickly overturned it and detained more than 20,000 of our prisoners of war. What will happen this time? We must be careful and vigilant! I told the village chief what was on my mind, and he agreed with me.

When the news reached our home, Mom couldn't stop smiling. The old lady even said, "See, we are still peace-loving people!" Fourth Sister Guiying shouted, "Brother is coming back this time!" Even our five-year-old Qing'er was smiling with his mouth open, I don't even know what he was happy about! In the evening, Dad came back from the construction site, and he was the same way, but he added, "Write to Tongxi and tell him to be more careful. Fighting the enemy is not a joke!" He was still as serious as ever when he said that. Mom also added, "Don't forget to write to him about the good days at home!"

Speaking of good days, I think they are good indeed. Let's start with our mutual aid team. In the spring of 1952, I attended the Beijing Municipal Model Laborer Conference, where I learned a lot about the benefits of mutual aid and gained a lot of advanced experience. After returning, I started planning to organize a mutual aid team. In the beginning, the difficulties were really great! Some didn't believe in it, others had "selfishness," and even Mom was saying strange things on the side. But you are in Korea, and I am a glorious military dependent, I can't fall behind! I can't bow to difficulties! Later, I and several activists in the village organized a mutual aid team. We borrowed a new-style farm tool, a "seven-inch walking plow," from the government, and also adopted scientific methods such as seed selection, sowing, sparse ridges, and dense planting. As soon as the autumn seedlings emerged, they were different from those of other families: the others were all yellowish and weak, while the mutual aid team's were dark green and strong. This caught the attention of the masses, and with a little organization, five mutual aid teams were established. This year, we planted a total of ten mu of corn, seven mu of beans, two mu of cotton, and two mu of millet. Sorghum was planted in the furrows. With sufficient fertilizer and favorable rainfall, the autumn crops are better than in previous years. The corn has grown to over ten feet tall, with cobs a foot long. The millet is already chest-deep, and the cotton has also reached chest height. I estimate that this year each mu of corn will yield at least 500 jin!

When there is no work in the fields, we engage in sideline occupations. Dad is old, but he is as good as anyone when it comes to work. Whenever your name is mentioned, he always says, "Tell him to work hard, I'll take care of things at home!" Now, he is working as a bricklayer on a construction site, leaving early and returning late every day, with plenty of energy! All the housework is done by Mom alone. Cooking, odd jobs, and also taking care of the pigs. The four pigs we raise are all growing fat. The two big ones weigh at least sixty or seventy jin, and the small ones will grow to forty or fifty jin by the Spring Festival. Third Sister Shuqing went to a factory in New Beijing two months ago. After you left, no one could handle our chestnut horse except me and Tonghua. We can do any work smoothly. Now the two of us are driving carts and repairing roads! Speaking of road repairs, the project is huge. The government has decided to build a highway from Haidian Town to our village, and the highway passes right in front of our door. Once it's built, it will be much more convenient to go to the city. The Central Institute of Physical Education is under construction at the northeast end of the highway, covering an area of ​​20 hectares, and one-fifth of the project will be completed this year. The public also occupied some of the land in front of our door, and the People's Government paid for it according to the land price. I have already discussed it with several activists in our village, and we plan to use this money to buy several sewing machines and plan a sewing factory together. This will benefit the country and us. I often think: when you return victoriously, this place will already be a beautiful cluster of tall buildings, and I will have become a worker myself. You won't even recognize the place or the people!

The adults are all busy, and the children are not idle either. Guiying, Second Brother Tongqing, and our Fuliang are all studying in the village's primary school. Their academic performance is very good. Take this semester, for example: Guiying's average score for seven subjects is eighty-three points, Fuliang's is seventy-four points, and Fuqing's score is not bad either. Whenever they hear stories of the Volunteer Army's heroic battles at school, they come back and talk about them endlessly, even our Qing'er can say a few words. "Fight the American devils," "peace," etc... He doesn't pronounce them very clearly, but he says them with great energy. Although Qing'er doesn't recognize you, if you ask him, "Where is your father?" he will immediately answer, "In Korea." If you ask, "What is he doing?" "Fighting American planes." When he says this, his little face is always full of smiles. Sometimes when Guiying and the others come back from school, they dance in our house, and Qing'er dances with them, chirping and singing. These days, when he sees us building the highway here, he strings several matchboxes together and pulls them back and forth on the bed. When others ask him, "What is this toy?" Guess what he answers? "A car!" A five-year-old child seems to know about the country's industrialization, his eyes looking to the future!

Here, the masses respect the families of soldiers very much. Even the primary school students in the village come to visit us during festivals. They help us clean the house, carry water, and grind grain. No one is satisfied if they are not allowed to do something. In the district, the masses elected me as a member of the district government, a member of the district preferential treatment committee, and recently I became a member of the district election committee, preparing for the general election! This spring, I also attended the Beijing Municipal Model Preferential Treatment Conference and gave a speech on stage. You probably can't guess how I felt at that time! I was very nervous before going on stage, and when people clapped, I was even more nervous. But when I talked about our past hardships and today's happiness, I became bolder and spoke for more than twenty minutes. At that conference, the People's Government also awarded me a portrait of Chairman Mao in a frame, a seven-inch walking plow, an enamel washbasin, one hundred jin of fertilizer, a floral bed sheet, and one and a half bolts of white cloth. Dad asked to hang the portrait of Chairman Mao in the center of the house, saying that he felt happy in his heart whenever he looked at the old man. The first few days of using the seven-inch walking plow to cultivate the land, the People's Government sent people to check on it twice, fearing that there was something wrong. We used the white cloth to make clothes for everyone and still had some left over. We made three sets of clothes for Qing'er. We haven't been willing to use that floral bed sheet yet, waiting for you to return victoriously to comfort you!

Tongxi, what will you think after reading this letter? You will definitely say, "Good days, no one is allowed to infringe upon them!" Although the enemy is now talking about peace with us, their words and deeds are always inconsistent. To believe it, we must look at their actual performance! The whole family wants you to keep a close eye on the enemy, and Korea must have true peace. At that time, you should also return victoriously, and see how happy the people of the motherland, me, Dad, Mom, and Qing'er will be to welcome you!

Shuqin, July 31st.

### 一家人的愿望

    一家人的愿望
    编者按：杨淑琴是北京市海淀区朱房行政村西洼街人。她的丈夫王桐禧于一九五一年报名参加了志愿军。由于党和人民政府对她的教育，以及她丈夫不断来信的鼓舞，她进步很快，现已被选为北京市的农业劳动模范和军属模范。这是她听到朝鲜停战协定签订后，写给她丈夫的一封信。亲爱的桐禧同志：
    七月二十九日上午，我有事到村政府去，村长杨秀明一把拉住告诉我：“淑琴同志，有个好事告诉你。”平常，村里的人都喜欢和我开玩笑，这次我又当成是开玩笑，理也没理他。可是，他接着又说：“听说了吗？我们硬拧着敌人的脖子和我们签订停战协定了！”桐禧，你能猜透我那一会儿的心情吗？我想：“这一回你可该回来了，回来参加咱国家的大建设，全家也可吃一个团圆饭！……”可是脑子又一转圈，我就想起上次咱和敌人签订的战俘遣返问题的协议，双方明明合计好的事，敌人很快就翻了案，扣留了我们二万多名战俘。这次又会怎么样呢？可得细心、警惕着些！我把心里的话告诉村长，村长也是这个看法。
    消息传到咱家，妈听了也是乐得合不住嘴，她老人家还说：“看看，还是咱和平人民！”四妹子桂英直嚷：“哥哥这回可要回来呀！”就是咱那五岁的青儿也是张着嘴笑，也不知道他乐的啥！晚上，咱爸从工地回来，也是这个样子，不过他加了一句：“写信告诉桐禧，叫他多加点仔细，和敌人干仗可不是闹着玩的！”说话时，他还是那样一本正经地。妈也补充：“别忘了，把家中的好日子都写给他！”
    说起来好日子，我看就是好。先从咱那个互助组说起吧。一九五二年春天，我参加了北京市劳动模范大会，在那里我知道了许多互助起来的好处，也吸取了不少的先进经验。回来后就着手计划组织互助组。刚一开始，那个困难劲儿，真是大呀！不是这个不相信，就是那个有“自私性”，就是咱妈当时也在一旁说怪话。可是，你在朝鲜，我是光荣军属，可不能落后呀！不能向困难低头呀！后来我和村上的几个积极分子，先组织了一个互助组。我们向政府贷了一个新式农具“七寸步犁”，还采用了选种、播种、稀垄、密植等科学方法，第一季的秋苗一出土，就和别家的不一样：别家的都是黄娇娇的，互助组的则是乌黑一片，笃笃实实的。这样一来，群众都起了眼，再加上一组织，就成立起五个互助组。今年的秋庄稼，咱共种了十亩玉米、七亩豆子、二亩棉花、二亩谷子，墒沟里都种上了高粱。上粪足，雨水又调和，秋庄稼比往年都好。玉米已长了丈多高，棒子足有一尺长，谷子已有一人深，棉花也长到了胸脯。我合计一下，今年每亩玉米至少也打他五百斤！
    田里没有活时，我们就去搞副业。咱爸年纪大了，可是干活还是一个顶一个。一提到你来，他老是说：“叫他好好干，家里事由我顶住！”现在，他在一个工地做瓦工，每天都是早出晚归，劲头可足着哩！家里的事，全由妈一个人来做。做饭、打杂，还带着喂猪。咱家喂的四口猪，都长得挺肥。两口大的，足有六七十斤重了，小的到春节，也可长到四五十斤。三妹淑卿，前两个月已经到新北京的一个工厂去了。你走后，咱那匹枣红马谁也使不住，只有我和桐华能摸住它的脾气，干啥活都顺当。现在我俩在赶车修路呢！说起来修路，工程可大了。政府决定从海淀镇到咱村修一条大公路，公路正经过咱的门前头。修成后，再进城可方便多了。公路东北头，正在动工修建中央体育学院，面积有二十顷地那么大，今年就要完成五分之一的工程。咱门口的那几亩地，公家也占了一部分，人民政府都按地价付了款。我已经和咱村的几个积极分子合计好，准备用这些钱买几部缝纫机，和大家一块筹划一个缝纫工厂。这样，对国家、对咱们都有好处。我常想：当你胜利回来了，咱这里已经是一片漂亮的高楼大厦，我自己也变成了工人，管叫你连地带人都不认识！
    大人都有了事，小孩也没有闲着。桂英、二弟桐庆和咱那福良，都在村里的小学念书。他们的学习成绩都很好。就拿这学期说吧，桂英七门功课的平均分数是八十三分，福良七十四分，福青考的也不坏。他们在学校一听到志愿军英勇战斗的故事，回来就说，一说呀，就没个头，连咱那青儿也会跟着说两句。什么“打美国鬼子呀”，“和平呀”……，他吐字不很清楚，可说得顶有劲。青儿虽说不认得你，要问他“你爸爸呢？”他马上就会答“在朝鲜。”再问“干啥？”“打美国飞机。”他说时，小脸上总是堆着笑容。有时桂英他们下学回来，就在咱屋子里跳舞，青儿也跟着他们跳，嘴里还吱吱呀呀地唱个不停。这几天，他看见咱这里修公路，就把几个火柴盒串到一块，在床上拉来拉去的，别人问他“这是啥玩艺儿？”你猜，他怎么回答？“汽车嘛！”五岁的小孩子，就好像知道祖国的工业化似的，两眼看着将来！
    在咱这里，群众对于军人家属都很尊敬。就是村里的小学生，逢年过节都到咱家来慰问。他们帮助咱打扫房子、挑水、推碾，不叫谁做，谁都不满意。在区上，群众选我为区政府委员，区优抚委员，最近还当上了区上选举委员会的委员，准备着搞大选呢！今年春上，我又参加了北京市的优抚模范大会，还上台讲了话。你准猜不透我那时是啥心情！没有上台时心慌得厉害，人家一拍巴掌，心更慌。可是一讲到咱过去的苦楚和今天的幸福，胆就大起来了，一说就是二十多分钟。在那次大会上，人民政府还奖给我了一个镶着镜框的毛主席像、一个七寸步犁、一个磁洗脸盆、一百斤肥田粉、一个花床单、一匹半白洋布。毛主席像爸叫挂在屋子的正中间，说天天看看他老人家心里就乐意。用七寸步犁耕地的头几天，人民政府还派人来看了两次，恐怕出了啥毛病。白洋布每人做了一件衣服还没用完，又给青儿做了三身。就是那个花布床单还没舍得用，等着你胜利回来了，慰劳慰劳你！
    桐禧，你看完了这封信，该会怎么样想呢？你一定会说：“好日子，不准任何人侵犯”吧！现在敌人虽说给咱谈和平了，可他们的嘴和心老是不一事。要相信，就得看他们的实际表现！一家人都要你紧紧地盯住敌人，非要朝鲜真和平不可，那时节，你也该胜利回来了，看祖国人民、看我、爸、妈还有青儿欢迎你的乐劲吧！
