Title: Slow Progress of Basic Construction Projects in Harbin

The progress of basic construction projects in Harbin is slow, and many projects have been severely delayed. For example, the civil construction task of the large electric motor factory, a key project in Harbin, only completed a little over 11% of the total annual task by mid-July. The task undertaken by the Industrial Construction Company of the Central Construction Engineering Department only completed 8.1% of the first-phase task (accounting for 60% of the entire project task) by July 14th. The Medical University construction site of the Songjiang Province First Construction Company only completed 18.2% of the annual task by the end of July. The 624 construction site of the Harbin First Construction Company was required to complete 60% of the task by July, but only actually completed 15%. The construction period of most other construction sites has also been delayed by 20 days to a month.

The reasons for the slow progress of the project are, first of all, many construction sites have poor planning, and the supply of materials, tools, and labor is not timely, resulting in a large amount of idle labor and work stoppages on site. For example, in the large electric motor factory construction site, when driving 56 side drainage cement pillars, the plan did not consider the efficiency of the equipment, nor did it consider the coordination of various types of work in the ancillary projects. The plan was to complete all tasks in 12 days, but it actually took 24 days. On some construction sites, workers often receive materials without tools, or they have tools without materials, resulting in work stoppages waiting for materials and tools. Some construction sites only consider one or a few types of work when formulating plans, and ignore the mutual coordination and simultaneous operation of several types of work, resulting in the progress being affected by each other between processes.

Secondly, the failure to fully utilize mechanical efficiency, the lax labor discipline, and the low labor efficiency also directly affect the progress of the project. One construction site leased six cement mixers from its affiliated company for one hundred days, but actually only used them for fifty days. And of those fifty days, the actual working hours only accounted for 74%. In terms of task completion efficiency, one hundred working days should have produced 7,200 cubic meters of concrete, but only 850 cubic meters were actually produced, only achieving 12% of the potential. The leading cadres of the Taiping construction site of another engineering office believed that the project task was not large, and installing a mixer was troublesome, so it was easier to mix manually; therefore, the construction site had machines but did not use them. The situation of lax labor discipline in many units is also very serious. For example, the attendance rate at the 624 construction site was only 80% at the highest, and only 45% at the lowest.

Although many construction sites have established a responsibility system, it has not been well implemented, and the phenomena of no one being responsible on site and chaotic construction organization continue to exist, which also affects the completion of the plan. For example, a certain engineering office has more than 700 people, more than 300 of whom are management personnel, with an average of one management person for every two or more workers, but management cadres cannot be seen on site. Workers often spend a long time on site before being assigned work. The workers said: "We are not afraid of heaven, we are not afraid of earth, we are just afraid of no one speaking on the site."

In response to the above serious situation, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a cadre meeting on basic construction, pointing out that it is necessary to further implement the comprehensive policy of "good, fast, economical, and safe", consolidate the responsibility system, strengthen plan management, vigorously promote advanced experience, and conscientiously do a good job in labor discipline education and security and welfare work. While ensuring quality, accelerate project progress and complete the third-quarter construction plan on schedule. At the same time, do a good job in preparing for the second-phase project and strive to start construction on schedule. At present, the construction departments of Harbin are implementing this instruction of the Municipal Party Committee in depth, combined with the specific conditions of their respective departments.

### 哈尔滨市基本建设工程进度迟缓

    哈尔滨市基本建设工程进度迟缓
    哈尔滨市基本建设工程进度迟缓，许多工程已严重拖延了工期。如哈尔滨市的重点工程——大型电机厂的土建任务，到七月中旬为止，仅完成了全年累计任务的百分之十一强；中央建筑工程部工业建筑公司承担的任务，到七月十四日止，只完成第一期任务（占整个工程任务百分之六十）的百分之八点一；松江省第一工程公司医大工地，到七月末只完成全年任务的百分之十八点二；哈尔滨市第一工程公司六二四工地，按要求到七月份应完成任务百分之六十，但实际只完成百分之十五。其它工地也大部拖延了二十天到一个月的工期。
    工程进度迟缓的原因，首先是很多工地计划不周，材料、工具、劳动力供应不及时，使得现场大量窝工、停工。如大型电机厂工地打五十六根边排水泥柱子，在计划中没考虑到设备效率，也没有考虑到附属工程各工种的配合，计划十二天全部完成任务，实际上二十四天才打完。有的工地工人在现场经常领到材料没有工具，或者是有了工具没有材料，造成了停工待料待工具等现象。有的工地在制定计划时只考虑到一个工种或少数工种，忽视了几个工种相互配合和同时作业，造成工序之间互相影响进度的情况。
    其次，机械效能没有得到充分发挥，劳动纪律松弛，劳动效率低下，也直接影响了工程进度。有一个工地向所属公司租用了六台水泥搅拌机，租用一百天，实际只用了五十天。而五十天中实际干活的工时只占百分之七十四。从完成任务效率方面看，一百个工作日应该生产七千二百立方公尺混凝土，但实际只生产了八百五十立方公尺，只发挥了百分之十二的作用。另一个工程处的太平工地的领导干部，认为工程任务不大，安装搅拌机麻烦，不如用人工搅拌省事；因此，工地有机器也不使用。不少单位劳动纪律松弛的情况也十分严重。如六二四工地出勤率最高才达到百分之八十，最低时只达百分之四十五。
    很多工地虽然建立了责任制，但没有很好地贯彻，现场上无人负责、施工组织混乱的现象仍继续存在，这也影响了计划的完成。如某工程处共有七百多人，就有三百多是管理人员，平均每两个多工人就有一个管理人员，但在现场上却见不到管理干部，工人每天到现场很久才分配到工作，工人说：“天不怕，地不怕，就怕现场无人来讲话。”
    针对上述的严重情况，中共哈尔滨市委召开了基本建设干部大会，指出：必须进一步贯彻“好、快、省、安全”的全面方针，巩固责任制，加强计划管理，大力推广先进经验，认真做好劳动纪律教育与保安福利工作。在保证质量的前提下，加速工程进度，按期完成第三季度施工计划。同时做好二期工程的准备工作，争取全部按期开工。目前哈尔滨市各施工部门正根据市委这一指示，结合本部门具体情况深入贯彻。
