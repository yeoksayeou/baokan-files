    The 23rd of August – the glorious day when the Soviet army liberated Romania, the day when the Romanian working people, led by the working class and under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, overthrew the fascist dictatorship – is the greatest national day of our people.
    Every year, the 23rd of August gives our working people an opportunity to look back on the great achievements they have made since the establishment of the People's regime. And whenever they look back on the great achievements our country has made, their hearts are filled with infinite gratitude to our liberator – the great Soviet Union. For it was the Soviet Union that opened up the bright path we follow today, and gave us fraternal and selfless assistance in our struggle to build socialism in our country.
    The preamble to the new Constitution of the People's Republic of Romania states:
    "The creation of the People's Republic of Romania is the result of the Soviet Union's historic victory over German fascism and the liberation of Romania by the glorious Soviet army. The liberation of Romania enabled the workers, led by the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party, to overthrow the Antonescu fascist dictatorship, eliminate the regime of the exploiting classes, and establish a people's democratic state that fully conforms to the interests and desires of the broad masses of the Romanian people."
    On August 23, 1944, Romania was still in a tragic situation. Due to the war, the country suffered severe damage and losses. And the drought and sabotage activities carried out by the enemies of the people further increased the country's losses and exacerbated the economic chaos. Famine and inflation deeply tormented the workers who were still shedding blood and sweat for the capitalists and the peasants who were toiling like beasts of burden for the landlords.
    Our people, led by the working class and fully trusting our Party, are fully capable of overcoming all difficulties, crushing all conspiracies of the domestic and foreign reactionary forces aimed at restoration, and creating a new life for themselves. The working people have finally broken free from the chains that bound their necks and eliminated the cannibalistic exploitation system in the factories. The material and cultural standards of the working people have also been continuously improved. A struggle aimed at eradicating cultural backwardness, developing science and culture, and educating the broad masses of the working people has long been launched throughout the country as part of the struggle to build socialism.
    The clauses in the Constitution regarding freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of procession and demonstration, freedom of religious belief, equal rights for all citizens regardless of nationality, race or sex, the right to work, the right to education and the right to rest, all demonstrate the full democratic nature of our people's regime.
    Our peaceful economy is constantly surging forward, with the aim of satisfying to a greater extent the ever-increasing material and cultural needs of the working people.
    We have achieved significant successes in developing socialist industry, especially in developing heavy industry and machine manufacturing. Thanks to the great selfless and fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, our industrial production has tripled in the five years since the implementation of industrial nationalization.
    The machine manufacturing industry established in our country under the People's Democratic regime has already manufactured many technical equipment necessary for various industrial sectors and machines needed for agriculture. We are now producing large quantities of large parallel lathes, high-speed precision lathes, pneumatic picks, foundry double grinding wheels, fifteen-ton trucks, ball bearings, locomotives, various oil refining equipment, coal mine conveyor belts, tractors and crawler tractors, threshing machines, as well as other textile machines and machines for the food industry.
    Oil production in 1952 was nearly double that of 1948, and will triple by the completion of the first Five-Year Plan.
    The electrical industry, established under the People's Democratic regime, has developed rapidly in a very short period of time. Some newly established electrical technology factories have been able to produce 1,000 kW electric motors and 5,600 kW transformers, as well as many other electrical equipment. After the completion of the Five-Year Plan, the People's Republic of Romania will be able to produce 2 million kW of electricity, more than three times the total production in the sixty years under the rule of capitalists and landlords.
    We are vigorously carrying out grand socialist construction projects such as the Danube-Black Sea Canal, the Lenin Hydropower Station, and the new giant steel center in Moldova.
    Significant achievements have also been made in light industry and consumer goods manufacturing. The production of cotton fabrics and clothing in 1953 increased several times compared to 1948, mainly due to the establishment of some large textile factories and garment factories like the large textile factory in Moldova and the Gheorghiu-Dej factory. We have built a large shoe factory that can produce 2.4 million pairs of shoes per year. Under the People's Democratic regime, a powerful canned food industry, pharmaceutical industry, and medical instrument manufacturing industry have been established.
    In agriculture, the working conditions and living standards of the working peasants have been improved, thanks to the land reform in 1945 which eliminated the landlord class and distributed the landlords' land to landless or land-poor peasants, and thanks to the government's measures to help peasants select seeds, provide low-interest loans to peasants to buy livestock, buy agricultural tools, etc.
    Since the historical task of implementing the socialization of agriculture was put forward at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party from March 3 to 5, 1949, socialist agriculture has achieved great successes. Socialist agriculture – including collective farms, co-operative farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms – accounts for 25 percent of the total cultivated land area. The number of collective farms has reached 1,966, and there are also 2,000 co-operative farms. 280,000 households of organized working peasants. The average yield per hectare on the land of collective farms and co-operative farms is 25 to 50 percent higher than that of individual farmers, so the members of collective farms have obtained huge incomes.
    As of May 1953, the People's Republic of Romania had 218 machine tractor stations. These machine tractor stations have a total of 9,650 tractors and 25,000 agricultural machines towed by tractors, which can cultivate 4.6 million hectares of land. In addition, state farms also have 4,400 tractors. During the second Five-Year Plan, the number of machine tractor stations will increase to 500, and the number of tractors will increase to 35,000 to 45,000.
    Comrade Gheorghiu-Dej made a detailed report on the achievements of collective farms at the First Congress of Advanced Workers of Collective Farms held in May 1953, put forward a series of measures for the steady development of agriculture, and pointed out the great prospects for the socialization of agriculture in the People's Republic of Romania. The report pointed out that by 1960, Romania's population would reach about 18 million to 18.5 million. As a result of the industrialization of socialist countries, the urban population, which had already increased from 3.8 million in 1948 to 5.5 million in 1953, will exceed 7 million by the end of 1960. The increase in population caused by the industrialization of the country puts forward the task of developing agricultural production in our country in the future.
    In the second Five-Year Plan, we will have 10 million hectares of cultivated land, producing 10 million tons of grain, while at present we can only harvest 6 to 7 million tons of grain, 2.5 million tons of sugar beet, 450,000 tons of sunflower seeds, 3.2 million tons of potatoes, as well as cotton that can meet domestic needs and a certain amount for export, more fruits and grapes. At the same time, it is necessary to expand the area of feed crops to 1.3 million hectares, so as to increase the yield of feed crops. By the end of the second Five-Year Plan, we will have 5.5 million buffaloes, 15 million to 16 million sheep and 4.6 million pigs.
    Judging from the increase in the production of consumer goods, the construction of new workers' housing, and the increasing number of working people spending their holidays in summer resorts, the living standards of the working people in our country are improving day by day. They are indeed getting richer day by day.
    The People's Democratic regime pays special attention to the continued development of light industry and the food industry, which have been improved in quality and quantity. In the second quarter of 1953, 23 percent more consumer goods were rationed to the people than in the same period of 1952. In 1953, the number of consumer goods obtained by the working people will be 55 percent more than in 1950, and as early as 1950, light industrial production had reached the level of 1938.
    In the nine years since the liberation of Romania, cultural life has also undergone revolutionary and thorough changes.
    The reform of school education has given millions of working people's children the opportunity to receive education. They were excluded from the school gates under the bourgeois and landlord regimes. Primary education is compulsory and free. The People's Republic of Romania currently has more than 2.2 million children in school and other school students. Many universities and various vocational schools have been established throughout the country. Secondary and higher technical schools have been greatly developed.
    In 1938 to 1939, the number of students in institutions of higher learning was about 29,000; in 1951 to 1952, the number of students increased to more than 55,000. In various schools, almost 90 percent of the students are the children of workers, working peasants, and intellectuals.
    The literature and art of the People's Republic of Romania are on the road to prosperity. This not only reflects the rapid improvement of the cultural level of the masses of the people, but also reflects the achievements in the application of the creative method of socialist realism. The improvement of the cultural and political level of the masses and their increasing cultural needs are a huge driving force for the development of Romanian literature and art. This situation can be seen from the large increase in the sales volume of books and periodicals and the increase in theater audiences, as well as many other facts. From 1950 to 1952, the total sales volume of books and periodicals reached 159 million copies.
    In 1953, new scientific research institutions attached to the Academy of Sciences of the People's Republic of Romania are being established. New cinemas and open-air theaters were also built last year. The establishment of the film industry, such as the construction of cultural institutions such as the "Jo V. Stalin - Spark Mansion" printing complex factory, the Povdia film production center, the Bucharest Musical Theater, and the construction of the Broadcasting Palace, are the material foundation for improving the cultural level of the working people.
    The foreign policy of the People's Republic of Romania is a policy of safeguarding national independence, a policy of strengthening and defending peace, opposing arms expansion and war preparations and launching new wars, a policy of upholding international cooperation and developing trade relations with all countries, and a policy of friendship with all peace-loving peoples.
    The Romanian people learn with love and joy from the example of the Chinese people's great achievements in the country's economic construction in a very short period of time. This achievement enables the People's Republic of China to begin its first Five-Year Plan and implement large-scale national industrialization. The great Chinese people are advancing rapidly and steadily along the road pointed out by the Communist Party of China and its long-tested and beloved leader, Chairman Mao Zedong.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the People's Republic of China is a powerful, unified and peace-loving country, which is an important factor in maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.
    The relations between the People's Republic of Romania and the People's Republic of China are developing and strengthening day by day; this fraternal relationship is embodied through the signing of exchange of goods agreements, scientific and technological cooperation agreements and cultural agreements. In the future, by strengthening the multifaceted ties between our two countries, the mutual understanding between the people of the two countries – the Romanian people and the great Chinese people – will be further deepened.

                    × × ×

    The Romanian people have made great achievements on the road to building socialism. However, all these achievements would not have been possible without the constant and generous help of the Soviet Union. That is why August 23 is a great festival for the Romanian people symbolizing Romanian-Soviet friendship. The achievements of the Romanian people clearly show that the Romanian people are active builders of a new life, and under the guidance of the invincible doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party headed by Comrade Gheorghiu-Dej, they are fully capable of eradicating the obstacles and difficulties on the road to building socialism and the happy life of the workers in their country.

    解放九年来的罗马尼亚人民共和国
    罗马尼亚人民共和国驻华特命全权大使  郭佐文
    八月二十三日——这个光荣的苏联军队解放罗马尼亚的日子，这个以工人阶级为首的罗马尼亚劳动人民在罗马尼亚共产党领导下推翻了法西斯专政的日子——是我国人民的最伟大的国庆节。
    每年的八月二十三日都给予我国劳动人民一个回顾人民政权建立以来所获得的巨大成就的机会。而每当他们回顾我国所获得的巨大成就时，心中就充满了对我国的解放者——伟大的苏联的无限感激。因为正是苏联替我们开辟了今天我们所遵循的光辉道路，以及在我国建设社会主义的斗争中给予我们以兄弟般的无私援助。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国新宪法的序言里这样说：
    “罗马尼亚人民共和国的产生是由于苏联对德国法西斯主义的历史性胜利和光荣的苏联军队解放罗马尼亚的结果，罗马尼亚的解放使得在共产党领导下以工人阶级为首的劳动者能够推翻安东尼斯库的法西斯独裁，消灭剥削阶级的政权并建立完全符合罗马尼亚人民大众利益和愿望的人民民主国家。”
    在一九四四年的八月二十三日，罗马尼亚还处在一种悲惨的境地中。由于战争，国家遭受了严重的破坏和损失。而旱灾和人民敌人所进行的破坏活动，更加增加了国家的损失，加剧了经济上的混乱。饥馑和通货膨胀深深地折磨着那些仍然为资本家流血流汗的工人和为地主做牛做马的农民。
    以工人阶级为首的、充分信任着我们的党的我国人民是完全能够克服一切困难，粉碎国内外反动势力所进行的目的在于复辟的一切阴谋诡计，而为他们自己创造一个新的生活。劳动人民毕竟挣脱了束缚着他们颈子的锁链，消灭了工厂中的吃人的剥削制度。劳动人民的物质和文化水平也不断地得到了提高。一个目的在于根绝文化落后的状况，发展科学和文化，教育广大劳动人民群众的斗争，早已作为建设社会主义斗争中的一部分而在全国范围内展开了。
    宪法中关于言论自由、出版自由、集会自由、游行及示威自由、信仰自由、一切公民不分民族、种族与性别一律享有平等权、劳动权、受教育权和休息权等条款都证明了我国人民政权的充分民主性。
    我们的和平经济在不断地高涨着，其目的乃是为了更大程度地满足劳动人民不断增涨着的物质和文化的需要。
    在发展社会主义工业方面，特别是在发展重工业和机器制造业方面，我们已经获得了重大的成就。由于伟大的苏联大力地无私地给予我们兄弟般的援助，我们的工业生产量在实行工业国有化以来的五年中已经增加到三倍。
    我国在人民民主政权下所创立的机器制造工业，已经制造了许多各工业部门所必需的技术设备和农业所需要的机器。现在我们正在大量地生产着大型的平行车床、高速精密车床、风镐、铸造双磨沙轮、十五吨载重汽车、球轴承、机车、各种炼油设备、煤矿输送带、拖拉机和履带式拖拉机、打谷机，以及其他纺织机和供食品工业使用的机器等。
    一九五二年石油生产量几达一九四八年的两倍，在第一个五年计划完成的时候则将达到三倍。
    在人民民主政权下创立起来的电器工业，已经在一个很短的时期内得到了迅速的发展。新建立起来的一些电气技术工厂已经能够生产一千瓩的电动机和五千六百瓩的变压器以及其他许多电气设备。在五年计划完成后罗马尼亚人民共和国将可以生产二百万瓩的电力，为资本家地主统治下六十年内生产总额的三倍多。
    我们正在大力地进行着多瑙河—黑海运河、列宁水力发电站和摩尔多瓦新的巨大的钢铁中心等宏大的社会主义建设工程。
    在轻工业及消费品制造工业方面，也获得了巨大的成就。一九五三年棉织品和衣服的生产量比一九四八年增加了好几倍，其主要原因是由于我们新建立了一些像在摩尔多瓦的大纺织厂和乔治乌—德治工厂那样的大纺织工厂和服装厂。我们已经建造了一个每年可以生产二百四十万双鞋的大型制鞋厂。在人民民主政权下强大的罐头食品工业、制药工业和医药仪器制造业已经建立了起来。
    在农业方面，由于一九四五年的土地改革消灭了地主阶级，将地主的土地分配给无地或少地的农民，由于政府采取帮助农民选种，以低利贷款给农民买牲口、买农具等等措施，使劳动农民的工作条件和生活状况得到了改善。
    自从一九四九年三月三日—五日罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会全体会议提出了实行农业社会主义化的历史性的任务后，社会主义农业获得了巨大的成就。社会主义性质的农业——其中包括集体农庄、共耕社、机器拖拉机站、国营农场——占全部耕地面积的百分之二十五。集体农庄的数目已经达到了一千九百六十六个，共耕社也有了二千个。组织起来的劳动农民有二十八万户。集体农庄及共耕社的土地上每公顷平均收获量比单干户多百分之二十五到五十，因而集体农庄庄员们获得了巨额的收入。
    至一九五三年五月为止，罗马尼亚人民共和国已经有了二百十八个机器拖拉机站。这些机器拖拉机站共拥有九千六百五十架拖拉机和二万五千架拖拉机所牵引的农业机器，可以耕种四百六十万公顷的土地。另外，国营农场还拥有四千四百架拖拉机。在第二个五年计划期间，机器拖拉机站的数字将增加到五百个，而拖拉机则要增加到三万五千架到四万五千架。
    乔治乌—德治同志在一九五三年五月举行的第一次集体农庄先进工作者代表大会上，作了关于集体农庄所获得的成就的详尽报告，提出了一系列的关于稳步发展农业的措施，并且指出了罗马尼亚人民共和国农业社会主义化的伟大远景。报告中指出：到一九六○年，罗马尼亚的人口将要达到一千八百万到一千八百五十万左右。由于实现社会主义国家工业化的结果，本来已经由一九四八年的三百八十万增加到一九五三年的五百五十万的城市人口，到一九六○年年底更将超过七百万。由于国家工业化所造成的人口的增加，向我国提出了今后发展农业生产的任务。
    在第二个五年计划中，我们将有一千万公顷的耕地，生产出一千万吨的粮食，而目前我们只能收获六百到七百万吨的粮食，二百五十万吨的甜菜，四十五万吨的向日葵籽，三百二十万吨的马铃薯，以及能满足本国需要的及一定数量供出口用的棉花，更多的水果和葡萄。同时，必须将饲料种植面积扩大到一百三十万公顷，这样就能增加饲料作物的产量。到第二个五年计划完成后，我们将有五百五十万头水牛，一千五百万到一千六百万头绵羊与四百六十万头猪。
    从消费品生产的增加，新的工人住宅的建造，愈来愈多的劳动人民在避暑胜地欢度假期等许多方面看来，我国劳动人民的生活水平正在日益改善中。他们的确是一天比一天更富有了。
    人民民主政权特别关心着在质和量上都已经得到了提高的轻工业和食品工业的继续发展。在一九五三年的第二季度内，配售给人民的消费品比一九五二年的同一时期内多出百分之二十三。在一九五三年内，劳动人民所获得的消费品的数量将比一九五○年多出百分之五十五，而早在一九五○年轻工业生产就已经达到了一九三八年的水平。
    在罗马尼亚解放以后的九年来，文化生活方面也经过革命而彻底地改变了。
    学校教育的改革，使得好几百万的劳动人民的子女有机会去受教育。他们在资产阶级和地主政权下都被排挤于校门之外。小学教育是义务的并且是免费的。罗马尼亚人民共和国现有在学儿童和其他学校的学生二百二十多万。许多大学和各种职业学校已经在全国各地建立起来了。中等和高等的技术学校已经大大地发展了。
    一九三八年到一九三九年中，在高等学校的学生数目约有二万九千人；一九五一年到一九五二年中，学生数目增加到五万五千多人。在各种学校里，几乎百分之九十的学生是工人、劳动农民和知识分子的子女。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的文学艺术正在走向高涨的道路。这不仅反映了人民群众的文化水平的迅速提高，而且也反映了对于社会主义现实主义的创作方法运用的成绩。群众的文化和政治水平的提高和他们日益增长的文化需求，是发展罗马尼亚文学艺术的一股巨大的动力。这种情况，可以从书籍刊物销售数量的大大增加和剧院观众的增多以及其他许多事实中看出来。一九五○年到一九五二年之中，书刊的总销售量达到一亿五千九百万册。
    在一九五三年中，附属于罗马尼亚人民共和国科学院的新的科学研究机构正在建立起来。去年也建造了新的电影院和露天剧场。影片工业的创立，如“约·维·斯大林——火花大厦”印刷综合工厂的文化机构的建设，波夫第亚制片中心、布加勒斯特的音乐剧院和广播宫的建造，都是提高劳动人民文化水平的物质基础。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的外交政策是维护民族独立的政策，是加强和保卫和平而反对扩军备战和发动新战争的政策，是拥护国际合作和与所有国家发展贸易关系的政策，也是与所有爱好和平的各国人民友好的政策。
    罗马尼亚人民以热爱和欣喜的心情来学习中国人民于一个很短的时期内在国家的经济建设方面取得巨大成就的范例。这种成就使得中华人民共和国能够开始进行她的第一个五年计划和实行国家的大规模工业化。伟大的中国人民正在向着中国共产党及其久经考验的和敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席所指出的道路迅速而稳步地前进。
    在中国共产党领导下，中华人民共和国已是一个强大的、统一的和热爱和平的国家，这对于维护远东和世界和平是一个重要的因素。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国与中华人民共和国之间的关系正在日益发展和加强着；这种兄弟般的关系通过了交换货物协定、科学技术合作协定和文化协定的签订而体现出来。今后，通过加强我们两国间的多方面的联系，两国人民——罗马尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民——之间的相互了解是会更加深切的。
                    ×    ×    ×
    罗马尼亚人民在建设社会主义的道路上获得了重大成就。但是，如果没有苏联的经常的和慷慨的帮助，那末所有这些成就是不可能得到的。那就是为什么八月二十三日对罗马尼亚人民来说是象征罗苏友谊的一个伟大节日。罗马尼亚人民所获得的成就清楚地说明了：罗马尼亚人民是新生活的积极建设者，而且在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的战无不胜的学说指导下，在以乔治乌—德治同志为首的罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，他们是完全能够铲除在建设本国的社会主义和劳动者幸福生活的道路上的障碍和困难的。
