Henan Correctly Implements Agricultural Tax Policy, Farmers' Production Enthusiasm Rises

[This newspaper dispatch] (From our newspaper correspondent) The Henan Provincial Party Committee and People's Government led the province's masses to overcome the severe disasters of late spring and early summer, and also successfully implemented the summer agricultural tax policy, and distributed relief funds, further promoting production and strengthening the relationship between the Party, the government, and the farmers.

This year, Henan Province reduced or exempted 55% of the total summer agricultural tax to be collected. In areas where the policy was correctly implemented, the farmers' enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. When cadres in severely affected townships in Wuyang and Chenggao counties announced the exemption of public grain for the entire township, the masses unanimously shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" The Zhaogu Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hui County originally had over 200,000 jin of bean cake and sesame cake in stock, but after the public grain burden was determined, it was sold out in two days. In Xiangcheng, Shenqiu, and other counties, after announcing relief to the masses and reducing or exempting public grain, and postponing or exempting loans, coupled with the prospect of a good autumn harvest, the masses were very happy. Laozhuang Township in Xiangcheng County is a severely affected area. After the frost disaster, the People's Government provided more than 50 million yuan in relief twice, and exempted more than 54 million yuan in overdue loans and 200,000 jin of public grain. The masses were sincerely grateful for the care of the Party and the People's Government. Many township farmers dried the public grain they were supposed to hand over again and again, preparing to pay it on time. In lightly affected areas and areas with good wheat harvests, such as Jiagou Township in Yanshi County, most farmers had concerns about increased burdens, which affected their production enthusiasm. Due to the publicity and implementation of the reduction and exemption policies and the "increased production without increased tax" policy, the masses were very excited. The wheat yield per mu of farmer Diao Kuan was originally 170 jin, but this year, due to good production, it reached 300 jin per mu. Initially, he was worried that if disaster areas produced less grain, the burden on non-disaster areas would be increased. After specific calculations, it turned out that he hadn't produced a single grain more than last year. Farmers said one after another: "The government is really rewarding production." In just a few days, more than 30 farmers in the township added livestock, farm tools, and fertilizers. Currently, the summer tax collection work is underway throughout the province. Public grain has begun to be stored in some areas, and 100 billion yuan in relief funds have been distributed. The main problems that still exist are: some cadres in some areas, due to their lack of in-depth work and failure to understand the unevenness of the disaster situation, only estimate the disaster situation based on general average figures, and do not investigate the specific situation of the disaster. At the same time, they are not clear about the purpose of the reduction, exemption, and relief work, and in the evaluation of the public grain burden, they violated the principle of reduction and exemption on a household basis. Instead, regardless of good or bad harvests, they stipulated the disaster situation throughout the county according to the output; or in the evaluation of the disaster situation, they did not evaluate the harvest, but evaluated a uniform actual output regardless of good or bad harvests. As a result, households with good harvests and light disasters were reduced more or exempted from the burden, while households with small harvests and severe disasters were reduced less or not reduced. Also, the relief grain in some disaster areas has not yet been distributed. The leading organs of Henan Province have sent responsible cadres to the disaster areas to earnestly check the above-mentioned situations and problems, and are now correcting and improving them.

    河南正确执行农业税政策农民生产情绪高涨
    【本报讯】河南省各级党委和人民政府领导全省群众战胜了春末夏初的严重灾害，又很好地执行了夏征农业税政策，并发放了救济款，进一步推动了生产，密切了党、政府和农民的关系。
    河南省今年夏征农业税减免了应征收数的百分之五十五。凡正确贯彻了政策的地区，农民生产情绪空前高涨。舞阳、成皋县的重灾乡群众听到干部宣布豁免全乡公粮时，一致高呼：“毛主席万岁！”辉县赵固供销合作社原存豆饼、麻饼二十余万斤，在确定公粮负担数后，两天就卖光了。项城、沈邱等县向群众宣布救济并减免公粮、缓交或免交贷款，加以秋季丰收有望，群众都很高兴。项城县老庄乡是重灾区，霜灾后人民政府两次救济五千多万元，豁免到期贷款五千四百多万元和公粮二十万斤，群众对党和人民政府的关怀衷心感激，很多乡农民把应交公粮晒了又晒，准备按时交纳。轻灾区和小麦丰收的地区，如偃师县夹沟乡，大部农民有怕加重负担的顾虑，影响了生产情绪。由于宣传和贯彻了减免政策和“增产不增税”的政策，群众都很兴奋。农民刁宽的地小麦产量每亩原为一百七十斤，今年因生产得好，每亩打了三百斤。起初他怕灾区出粮少了，非灾区会加重负担，后经具体计算，比去年没多出一粒粮。农民纷纷说：“政府真是奖励生产。”不几天全乡就有三十多户农民添置了牲口、农具和肥料。目前全省夏征工作正在进行，部分地区公粮已开始入库，救济款已发放下去一千亿元。还存在的主要问题是：部分地区干部由于工作不深入，不了解灾情的不平衡性，只凭一般平均数字估计灾情，对灾情具体情况不摸底。同时对减免和救济工作的目的性不明确，在评议公粮负担时违反了以户为单位进行减免的原则，而是不分收成好坏，在全县范围内按照产量规定灾情；或在评议灾情时不评定收成，而是不分收成好坏，评为统一实产量，结果使收成好、受灾轻的农户减的多或豁免了负担，而收成少、受灾重的农户却少减或没减。还有部分灾区的救济粮仍未发放下去。河南省领导机关已派负责干部亲赴灾区，切实检查了上述情况和问题，现正纠正改进中。    （吕建中）
