Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 5th: The well-known French peace fighter and member of the National Committee of the Republican Youth League of France, Henri Martin, was released from prison on the morning of the 2nd. Henri Martin was sentenced to five years of hard labor in 1950 for opposing the colonial war in Indochina. For three years, the French people have been fighting to secure Martin's release.

    Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party, wrote in "l'Humanité": "The release of Henri Martin is of great significance because he is regaining his freedom at a time when the forces opposing the Indochina War are growing day by day, even influencing government officials."
    Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: Vietnam News Agency reports: "Voice of Vietnam" radio broadcast the news of the release of the famous French peace fighter Henri Martin on the 4th. In a commentary on this news, the radio said that this is a great victory for the growing movement of the French people demanding an end to the "dirty war" in Vietnam and the release of French democratic leaders still detained by the French ruling clique.

    法和平战士亨利·马丁出狱
    【新华社五日讯】巴黎消息：法国著名和平战士、法兰西共和青年联盟全国委员会委员亨利·马丁在二日晨出狱。亨利·马丁因为反对在印度支那进行殖民战争，于一九五○年被判五年苦役。三年来，法国人民曾为争取释放马丁而一直坚持斗争。
    法国共产党书记雅克·杜克洛在“人道报”写道：“亨利·马丁获得释放这件事是有重大意义的，因为他是在这样的时候恢复自由的：反对印度支那战争的力量在一天天增长，甚至政府人士都受到了影响。”
    【新华社五日讯】越南通讯社讯：“越南之声”电台四日广播了著名法国和平战士亨利·马丁出狱的消息。电台就这消息发表评论说，这是法国人民要求停止在越南的“肮脏战争”、释放仍被法国统治集团拘禁着的法国民主领袖的日益高涨的运动的一个巨大胜利。
