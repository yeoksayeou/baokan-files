Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 12th: The truth about Syngman Rhee's "release" of more than 27,000 captured personnel from our side before the Korean armistice has been preliminarily revealed by the Korean People's Army prisoners of war who returned on August 10th, based on eyewitness accounts.

　　Jiang Yishan (prisoner number 152025), who returned on the 10th, was being secretly detained in the detention room of the U.S. G2 intelligence agency in the prisoner-of-war camp in Dongnae, near Busan, when Syngman Rhee "released" the prisoners of war on June 19th. That afternoon, he suddenly heard a lot of noise outside. He peeked through the crack in the door and saw the gate of the prisoner-of-war camp wide open, and two barbed wire fences had two large gaps cut three meters wide. As U.S. soldiers shouted, "LET GO!" (meaning: go!), the captured personnel were driven out from the gate and the gaps. U.S. troops and Syngman Rhee's puppet army soldiers with guns were chasing behind them, telling them to gather on the road to Busan at the entrance. Those who did not want to go were beaten with rifle butts. Eight people were knocked to the ground on the spot. More than 300 captured personnel who were driven onto the road listened to a speech by an officer of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, and then formed five columns and were escorted to Busan by the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

　　Another Korean People's Army prisoner of war, Xuan Dianxi (prisoner number 152086), who returned from the First Rest Center of the 14th Field Hospital in Busan, talked about how, after the Chinese and Korean side protested against Syngman Rhee's large-scale forced detention of our captured personnel, although the U.S. side replaced the personnel guarding the rest center with U.S. troops, a special agent of the Syngman Rhee bandit gang named Zhu, sent by the U.S. intelligence agency CIE to the rest center, still spread rumors among our captured personnel about "releasing" prisoners of war, saying, "If you 'escape,' the U.S. military will never interfere." He specially brought a pair of pliers and gave it to another special agent named Jin Xifeng, asking him to cut the barbed wire fence and force the captured personnel to "escape." Under the connivance of the U.S. side, from June 20th to 23rd, more than 60 captured personnel from our side were coerced by the Syngman Rhee bandit gang to leave the prisoner-of-war camp under the name of "release." This is the fact revealed that is enforced detention in the name of "release."

    归来的我方被俘人员
    揭露美方纵容李承晚“释放”战俘的真相
    【新华社开城十二日电】李承晚在朝鲜停战实现以前“释放”二万七千余名我方被俘人员的真相，已由八月十日遣返归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员以目击的事实初步揭露出来。
    十日归来的姜意善（俘虏编号为一五二零二五）在六月十九日李承晚“释放”战俘的时候，他正被秘密拘禁在釜山附近东莱战俘营的美方G2特务机关的监禁室中。当天下午，忽然听得外面人声嘈杂，他从门缝中偷看，只见战俘营大门敞开，并有两道铁丝网被剪开了三公尺宽的两个大缺口。随着美军士兵喊声：“LET GO！”（意思是：走吧！）被俘人员就从大门和缺口处被赶出来，而手执枪枝的美军和李承晚伪军则在后面赶着，并要他们到门口通釜山的公路上去集合。不愿走的，就挨枪托痛打，当场就有八个人被枪托打倒在地上。被赶到公路上的三百多个被俘人员，听了李伪军一个军官的讲话后，就排成五路纵队，由李伪军押往釜山去了。
    另一位从釜山第十四野战病院第一休养所归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员玄点席（俘虏编号一五二零八六）谈到在朝中方面抗议李承晚大规模强迫扣留我方被俘人员以后，虽然美方将看守休养所的人员换为美军，但美国特务机关CIE派在该休养所的一个姓朱的李承晚匪帮的特务仍在我方被俘人员中散布“释放”战俘的谣言，并说“你们‘逃跑’，美军决不干涉”。他特地带来一把钳子，交给另一个名叫金锡凤的特务，要他剪开铁丝网胁迫被俘人员“逃跑”。在美方纵容下，从六月二十日到二十三日，又有六十多名我方被俘人员在“释放”的名义下，被李承晚匪帮胁迫离开战俘营。这就是以“释放”为名而实行强迫扣留所揭露出来的事实。
