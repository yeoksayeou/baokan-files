Returning to the Embrace of the Motherland
    Fang Ming

Many captured personnel who suffered inhumane treatment in the U.S. POW camps have finally returned, batch after batch.

Singing passionately and shouting slogans, they tore the clothes with the English words "POW" painted on them to shreds. Some returning comrades, both on and off the vehicles, tried their best to hold back their tears. Standing before their own people, they raised their hands to the brims of their military caps with red star emblems—caps they had risked their lives to make in the POW camps—saluting, standing erect at attention during roll call. However, when they touched the hands extended by their comrades and stepped into the tents of the motherland, tears of excitement suddenly burst forth.

August 5th, the first day of repatriating prisoners of war. The first batch sent back were sick and wounded POWs from the Korean People's Army. As the vehicles with red cross markings approached the hillside of our handover zone, people heard a kind of singing that seemed isolated, as if it was coming from afar. After a while, the vehicles drew closer, and people saw the returning sick and wounded personnel pressing their handmade national flags of the fatherland and red flags with the hammer and sickle against the glass windows. The vehicles stopped, the doors opened, and a huge, suppressed sound suddenly erupted. They sang and shouted. The comrades who got off the vehicles threw everything from the enemy POW camps on the ground: moldy rice balls made of barley and yellow soybeans, broken shoes, tattered clothes... Batch after batch, the returning personnel expressed their extremely excited feelings with the same actions. The next day, I saw a wounded soldier of the Korean People's Army named Kim Jung-won. His eyes were bandaged, and he couldn't see anything. Others said that when he was in the car, he impatiently kicked the door all the way. After getting off the car, he was only wearing a pair of shorts, throwing all the enemy's belongings onto the enemy's car. He shouted in a hoarse voice, trying desperately to break free from the hands of his own people to find the enemy and fight to the death. Why did he lose his eyes? Because he insisted on returning to his homeland, and in the end, the enemy gouged out his eyeballs with hooks.

A returning soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers tore off his ragged clothes, revealing two V-shaped purplish-red scars that covered his entire chest. He was still spitting blood. Why did he suffer this cruel punishment? Because he, like his comrades, resolutely said to the enemy: "I want to return to my motherland!" Even after the armistice agreement was signed, in recent days, the U.S. side was still abusing these people who were about to be repatriated.

The first batch of returning personnel from Jeju Island, because they demanded the release of comrades who should be repatriated but were detained by the U.S. side, one hour before their departure—at six o'clock in the morning on July 28th—the enemy carefully observed the wind direction and barbarously launched hundreds of various gas bombs at these hundreds of people, laughing wildly. Black and yellow smoke shrouded the entire barbed wire fence, and people vomited on the ground, coughing up blood, and many were burned. Many people fainted. At the time of departure at seven o'clock, more than one hundred of the six hundred people were being supported or carried by their comrades.

The second batch of returning personnel from Jeju Island were locked by the U.S. side in the bottom of ships behind layers of barbed wire for two days and two nights. Thirty of them were squeezed into one compartment. The enemy sealed all the doors and windows. The returning personnel shouted, "We want air!" However, the enemy blocked even the smallest holes. In the two and a half hours that followed, many people suffocated. In one compartment, twelve out of thirty people collapsed. People used all their strength to pry open the gaps in the doors and windows. After landing in Incheon, the enemy fed them boiled barley with seawater, making it impossible for them to swallow. On average, they couldn't get a grain of rice for more than twenty hours. When they asked for food on the train, the enemy held up gas bombs and said, "There is no food, only this."

People who had suffered all kinds of hardships but remained unyielding finally returned to the embrace of the motherland. They stepped off the buses proudly, singing loudly, holding high the two- or three-foot-long national flags they had made at the risk of their lives, wearing their self-made military caps properly.

They returned, and in our handover zone, there was a sea of cheers. The returning personnel jumped out of the cars, shouting "Long live!" The sick and wounded personnel struggled to sit up on their stretchers, shouting: "Long live!" Some raised their hands, but extreme weakness caused their hands to droop in front of their chests. However, people could hear that they were still shouting "Long live!"

They got into their own comfortable vehicles and entered the sanitary passage zone. The leaders warmly shook hands with the sick and wounded personnel who got off the vehicles. They cried for the second time. The leaders said: "Comrades, you are home, don't cry, returning is victory." But they cried even harder. They never shed tears in the face of the enemy's torture and the threat of death, but when they saw their relatives and returned to the embrace of the motherland they had longed for day and night, they couldn't help but cry.

Now, they have taken baths, had their hair cut, put on brand new clothes, and have spent their first warm night in the care of their loved ones. (Xinhua News Agency)

    回到祖国怀抱
    方明
    在美方战俘营里受尽非人待遇的许多被俘人员终于一批又一批地回来了。
    他们激昂地唱着歌，喊着口号，把漆着英文“战俘”两字的衣服撕得粉碎。有些归来的同志，在车上和车下，尽量地抑止着自己的眼泪，他们站在自己人的面前，把手举在嵌着红五星帽花的军帽——这是他们拚着死在战俘营里制成的——帽沿上行着军礼，挺着胸，点名的时候立正站着。然而，当他们接触到自己同志伸出来的手，在走进祖国的帐篷时，激动的眼泪突然涌出来了。
    八月五日，遣返战俘的第一天。第一批遣送来的是朝鲜人民军的病伤战俘。当有着红十字标志的车辆靠近我方交接区的山坡时，人们听到一种被什么东西隔离着的歌声，它好像是从远方传来的。一会，车子接近了，人们望见归来的病伤人员用手按在玻璃窗上的自己制作的祖国国旗和镰刀斧头的红旗。车子停下来，车门被打开了，被闷住的巨大声音突然爆发出来，他们唱着，叫着。 下车的同志，把所有敌人战俘营里的东西都摔在地上：大麦和黄豆瓣煮成的霉饭团、破皮鞋、烂衣服……。一批接着一批，归来人员都以同样的行动表现了他们万分激动的心情。第二天，我看见了这样一个朝鲜人民军伤员，他叫金井元。他的眼睛上绑着绷带，什么也看不见了。别人说他在车上时，一路上急不可耐地用力地踢着车门。下车来了，他只穿着一条短裤，把所有的敌人的东西扔在敌人的车上。他用一种已经嘶哑了的声音喊叫着，竭力想从自己人的手里挣脱，要寻找敌人拚命。为什么他失去了眼睛呢？因为他坚持要回祖国，最后，敌人用钩子挖出了他的眼珠。
    一位中国人民志愿军的归来人员撕掉破烂的衣服，露出两个占满整个胸膛的V字形的烙伤的紫红色血痕，现在他还吐着血。为什么他要受到这种残酷的刑罚呢？因为他和其他同志一样，坚决地对敌人说：“我要回祖国！”就在停战协定签字后，在最近几天，美方还在虐害这些就要遣返的人。
    从济州岛来的第一批归来人员，因为他们要求释放被美方拘禁的应该遣返的同志，在他们出发前的
    一小时——七月二十八日的上午六时。敌人仔细地看好了风向，野蛮地狂笑着对这几百个人打出了几百颗各种瓦斯弹。黑色的和黄色的浓烟笼罩了整个铁丝网，人们伏在地上呕吐着，咳着血，有许多人被烧坏了。许多人晕过去了。在七点钟出发的时候，六百人中有一百多人是被自己的同志们扶着抬着走的。
    从济州岛来的第二批归来人员，被美方在层层铁丝网的船底层里关了两天两夜，他们三十个人挤在
    一个格子里。敌人封闭了所有的门窗。归来的人员喊着“我们要空气！”然而，敌人反而把最小的洞也堵死了。在这以后两个半小时内，许多人窒息了，有一个格子里三十人中倒下了十二个。人们拚着所有的力量才碰开了门窗的空隙。在仁川上陆以后，敌人用海水煮大麦给他们吃，使他们不能下咽。平均二十几个钟头还吃不到一粒饭，他们在火车上要求吃饭时，敌人举着瓦斯弹说：“没有饭吃，只有这个”。
    受尽苦难的然而不屈不挠的人们终于回到祖国的怀抱里了。他们昂然跨下汽车，高声唱歌，高举着拚死做成的两三尺长的国旗，他们端端正正的戴着自制的军帽。
    他们回来了，在我方交接区，是一片万岁声。归来人员跳下车来喊着“万岁！”病伤人员在担架上挣扎着探起身来，喊着：“万岁！”有的人举起双手，但是极端的衰弱又使他的双手垂在胸前，然而，人们听得出来他还在喊着“万岁！”
    他们换上了自己的舒适的汽车，进入卫生通过区，首长们和下车的病伤人员热情地握着手。他们第二次哭了。首长们说：“同志们到家了，不要哭，回来就是胜利。”但是，他们哭得更厉害了，他们在敌人的酷刑和死亡的威胁的前面是从不掉泪的，然而当他们见到了亲人，回到了日夜想望的祖国的怀抱里的时候就禁不住哭了。
    现在，他们已经洗了澡、理了发，换上了全新的衣服，已经在亲人的照顾下，安静地度过了第一个温暖的夜晚。（新华社）
