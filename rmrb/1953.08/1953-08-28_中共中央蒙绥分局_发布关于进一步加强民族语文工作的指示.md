    The CPC Central Committee Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Sub-bureau Issues Instructions on Further Strengthening Ethnic Minority Language Work
    The CPC Central Committee Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Sub-bureau recently issued instructions on further strengthening ethnic minority language work. The instructions first pointed out that under the correct guidance of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government's ethnic policies, considerable achievements have been made in the development of the Mongolian language in Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan regions in recent years. However, there are still many shortcomings and even errors in this work. The most important shortcomings and errors are: first, the widespread existence of a tendency to belittle and ignore the use of the Mongolian language in various agencies and among the vast number of cadres; and second, the confusion of the use and development of ethnic minority languages with narrow nationalism, thus opposing it. These situations have had adverse effects on the development of ethnic minority languages and the implementation of the Party and the People's Government's policies among the Mongolian masses.
    In order to overcome the errors and tendencies of neglecting ethnic minority languages, further strengthen Mongolian language work, and better serve the further development of the autonomous region's political, economic, and cultural undertakings, the sub-bureau stipulated eight specific measures to strengthen language work in the instructions.
    1. In conjunction with the study of ethnic policies, Party committees, governments, and relevant departments at all levels should conduct a thorough examination of the problems existing in carrying out work through ethnic forms and in developing ethnic minority language work. Affirm achievements, criticize errors, educate cadres theoretically and politically, and take practical and feasible specific measures to solve existing problems.
    2. Carry out Mongolian language learning. Carrying out Mongolian language learning among cadres in a planned and focused manner is the key to carrying out Mongolian language work. Therefore, (1) comrades with a certain foundation in Mongolian should continue to study diligently to ensure that they reach a level of proficiency within a certain period; (2) comrades who speak Mongolian but do not know Mongolian writing should learn Mongolian writing, and Mongolian literacy campaigns should be carried out among Mongolian cadres; (3) comrades who do not speak Mongolian should generally learn everyday phrases and continue to improve; (4) Han comrades are welcome to participate; however, Han cadres who directly and frequently interact with Mongolian masses and cadres who do not understand Han Chinese should also learn Mongolian language. Leading comrades of various agencies should attach importance to this learning, and sufficient time should be guaranteed for learning.
    3. In mass literacy work, Mongolian should be used for literacy in areas where Mongolian is spoken daily. Mongolian primary schools should generally use Mongolian textbooks, and starting from the fourth grade, Han Chinese should be appropriately added according to the conditions of different regions. The curriculum of Mongolian middle schools in various places can stipulate the proportion of Mongolian and Han Chinese according to the future needs of higher education and work. The issues of teachers in Mongolian schools and the further education of Mongolian students should be resolved in a planned manner.
    4. Various documents and instructions issued by Party, government, and mass organizations should be translated into Mongolian when their direct or indirect targets include a certain number of Mongolian masses or cadres. Mongolian should be mainly used in pastoral areas and purely Mongolian areas. Various registration forms and certificates should be made in Mongolian and Han Chinese as far as possible. Interpreters must be used at various meetings if there are a considerable number of comrades who do not understand Han Chinese. Individual translation can be used when the number of such people is too small. Various short-term training classes should pay attention to solving the difficulties of comrades who do not understand Han Chinese, and in the future, some short-term training classes in economics, trade, cooperation, veterinary medicine, hygiene, secretarial work, and other majors taught in Mongolian should be held as needed. Radio stations in the Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan region should gradually increase Mongolian programs. Railway stations, bus stations, state-owned stores, cooperatives, banks, post offices, hospitals, etc., in the Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan region should gradually make their signs and price tags in both Mongolian and Han Chinese. State-owned stores, cooperatives, banks, and post offices that have a lot of contact with Mongolian masses should appropriately solve the language difficulties of Mongolian villagers.
    5. Cultivate Mongolian language cadres in a planned way, and reward good Mongolian works, compilations, and translations. In terms of cultivating Mongolian language cadres, on the one hand, improve the level of existing professional Mongolian language cadres, and establish Mongolian specialty schools to train compilation and translation staff; on the other hand, some cadres with a foundation in Mongolian language should be transferred and assigned to Mongolian language work in a planned way.
    6. Establish Mongolian language research work. Establish a Mongolian Language Research Association. The research association should become a research organization for Mongolian language workers in the entire region, and the research association can set up several research groups as needed.
    7. Strengthen the Party and government's leadership over Mongolian language work. Mongolian language work, like any other work, cannot be thoroughly implemented without the leadership of the Party. The propaganda departments of Party committees and the cultural and educational departments of governments at all levels should make the implementation of the Party and government's ethnic minority language policies one of their regular tasks. It is necessary to constantly educate the masses and cadres to overcome erroneous ideas and misunderstandings in this regard. It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of existing Mongolian language work departments and improve their work quality; it is necessary to solve the problems of learning materials, popular reading materials, and textbooks urgently required by cadres, the masses, and middle and primary schools in a planned way; it is necessary to continue to strengthen the publication of the Mongolian version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"; it is necessary to improve the printing and distribution of Mongolian newspapers and periodicals that are closely related to Mongolian language work.
    8. The establishment committee, organization department, personnel department, and finance department should solve the necessary establishment problems, cadre deployment problems, and various funding problems that occur with the strengthening of language work.

    中共中央蒙绥分局
    发布关于进一步加强民族语文工作的指示
    中共中央蒙绥分局，最近发出关于进一步加强民族语文工作的指示。指示首先指出：内蒙古、绥远地区几年来，在毛主席和中央人民政府正确的民族政策指导下，发展蒙古语文的工作，已有相当大的成绩。但在这方面的工作，也还存在着许多缺点甚至错误。最主要的缺点与错误：一是在各机关和广大干部中相当普遍地存在着轻视蒙古语文并忽视使用蒙古语文的偏向；一是把使用并发展民族语文与狭隘民族主义混为一谈，因而加以反对。这些情况已对民族语文的发展及在蒙古群众中贯彻党和人民政府的各项政策，发生了不良影响。
    为了克服忽视民族语文的错误和倾向，进一步加强蒙文工作，使语文工作更好地为进一步发展自治区的政治、经济、文化事业服务，分局在指示中规定了八项加强语文工作的具体措施。
    一、结合民族政策的学习，各级党委、政府以及各有关部门对通过民族形式进行工作以及在发展民族语文工作方面存在的问题，认真进行一番检查。肯定成绩，批判错误，从理论上政策上教育干部，并采取切实可行的具体措施解决现有问题。
    二、开展蒙文学习。在干部当中有步骤有重点地开展蒙文学习是开展蒙文工作的关键。因此，（1）有一定蒙文基础的同志要认真继续学习，保证在一定时间内达到会用的程度；（2）会蒙语不会蒙文的同志，要学会蒙文，在蒙古干部当中进行蒙文扫盲；（3）不会蒙语的同志，一般要学会日常的话，而继续提高；（4）汉族同志自愿参加；但直接和不懂汉文汉语的蒙古群众及其干部长期接触并进行工作的汉族干部，也要学会蒙文蒙语。各机关的领导同志要重视此项学习，学习时间要有保证。
    三、群众中的扫盲工作，日常讲蒙语的地区，一律以蒙文进行扫盲。蒙古小学一般要采用蒙语课本，从四年级开始，根据不同地区的情况再适当增加汉文。各地蒙古中学的课程可依据将来升学和工作等各方面情况，规定各地蒙、汉文的比例。蒙古学校的师资问题和蒙古学生的升学问题要有计划地解决。
    四、党、政、群各机关发出的各种文件、指示，它的直接或间接对象里边包括一定数量的蒙族群众或干部时，要用蒙文翻译。牧区、纯蒙人区主要用蒙文。各种登记表格、证明书尽可能作到蒙、汉文对照。各种会议如有相当数量的不懂汉话的同志，一定要用翻译。人数过少时可采用个别翻译。各种短期训练班要注意解决不会汉话同志的困难，并且今后根据需要举办一些以蒙语授课的财经、贸易、合作、兽医、卫生、秘书工作等专业的短期训练班。蒙绥地区广播电台要逐步增设蒙语节目。蒙绥地区的火车站、汽车站、国营商店、合作社、银行、邮局、医院等，在牌子、标价等方面逐步作到蒙、汉文对照。与蒙古群众接触多的国营商店、合作社、银行、邮局要适当解决蒙古老乡的语言上的困难。
    五、有计划地培养蒙文工作干部，奖励好的蒙文著作、编纂、翻译。培养蒙文工作干部上，一方面，提高现有专业蒙文工作干部的水平，成立蒙文专科学校培养编译工作人员；另一方面，要有计划地调剂与配备一些有蒙古语文基础的干部作蒙古语文工作。
    六、建立蒙文研究工作。建立蒙文研究会。研究会应成为全区蒙文工作者研究组织，研究会根据需要可设若干研究组。
    七、加强党、政对蒙古语文工作的领导。蒙古语文工作也和其他任何工作一样，没有党的领导就不能保证彻底贯彻。各级党的宣传部门和各级政府文教部门应把党、政对民族语文政策的贯彻作为经常工作之一。要经常教育群众和干部克服这方面的错误思想和误解。要加强对现有蒙文工作部门的领导，提高其工作质量；要有计划地解决干部、群众和中、小学校所迫切要求的学习材料、通俗读物及教科书问题；要继续加强“毛泽东选集”蒙文版的出版工作；要改进与蒙文工作有密切联系的蒙文书报的印刷工作与发行工作。
    八、编制委员会、组织部门、人事部门和财政部门要解决随着语文工作的加强而发生的必要的编制问题、干部调配问题和各项经费问题。
