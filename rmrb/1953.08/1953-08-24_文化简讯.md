The folk art section also received the Indian art delegation and overseas Chinese representatives. The total number of visitors was over 50,000.

	Although these exhibits are only from Jiangsu Province, they enable us to recognize the richness of our national folk art and the outstanding artistic talents of our working people, which is enough to encourage art workers to learn from folk art. At the same time, this exhibition also reviewed the achievements in art creation in the province over the past year.

	During the exhibition, the organizing committee also invited responsible persons and representatives from relevant authorities such as the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Jiangsu Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau, the Nanjing Municipal Cultural Relics Management Office, and the Fine Arts Department of Nanjing Normal College to form an evaluation committee, selected more than 20 art creations, and sent them to the Central Ministry of Culture in Beijing after the exhibition. The folk art part was all transported to East China to participate in the East China Regional Folk Art and Crafts Exhibition.
