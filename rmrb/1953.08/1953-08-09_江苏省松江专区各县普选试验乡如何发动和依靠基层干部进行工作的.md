The grassroots election work in the pilot villages for universal suffrage in Songjiang Special District, Jiangsu Province, has been smoothly launched. Among them, Dongjing Township in Songjiang County, Yancang Township in Nanhui County, and Huangqiang Township in Jiading County have completed the population survey and voter registration and are now preparing for elections. Other pilot townships have also entered the stage of population survey and voter registration. The experience of the grassroots universal suffrage pilot work in Songjiang Special District proves that mobilizing and relying on grassroots cadres to do election work is an extremely important issue.

According to the situations in Yancang, Huangqiang, and Dongjing Townships, there are four types of grassroots cadres. These three townships have a total of 267 grassroots cadres, among whom 70 are of good essence, work actively, and closely contact the masses; 95 are of good essence but have some problems in their work style and lifestyle, and are basically supported by the masses; 86 are of good essence but lack high awareness and are not active enough in their work; and 16 are of poor quality, have committed violations of law and discipline, or are class dissidents who have sneaked into the revolutionary ranks, accounting for 5.9 percent of the total number of cadres. From the situations in these three townships, it can be seen that the grassroots organizations are basically pure, and the grassroots cadres are basically good, making it entirely possible to mobilize and rely on grassroots cadres to do a good job in universal suffrage.

The grassroots cadres in these three townships have different understandings of universal suffrage. Initially, some cadres had misunderstandings and great concerns. Cadres who have always been active in their work and closely contact the masses are confident in striving to be elected, but their concept of fully developing democracy is not clear, and some still have a certain degree of pride and complacency. Cadres of good quality but who have made mistakes of commandism in their work have great concerns, fearing that the leadership will kick them aside. Zhu Jingen, the village chief of Luxin Village in Yancang Township, said: "I wasn't touched by the 'Three-Anti' campaign, but universal suffrage will turn against me!" Cadres with low awareness feel that they have been criticized by higher authorities for not doing a good job in the past, scolded by their families for not doing a good job in production, and have opinions from the masses due to their poor work style, so it doesn't matter if they are voted out in this universal suffrage. Some are hesitant, such as Tao Xianglin, a cadre in Yancang Township, who said: "It's tiring to pick it up, and I can't bear to let it go!" Individual lawbreakers and discipline violators threaten and entice the masses, some talk strangely, and some sell their merits and talk about their hardships, trying to win the sympathy of the masses.

At the beginning, the work teams in the pilot townships for universal suffrage in Songjiang Special District and some counties had excessive demands on grassroots cadres, only seeing the shortcomings of grassroots cadres and not their achievements, nor analyzing the reasons and responsibilities for the shortcomings. They felt that "these cadres are really unqualified"; for cadres of good essence but who have temporarily become passive due to encountering many practical difficulties in work and production, they are considered to have "cut themselves off from the Party" and "cut themselves off from the people," watching them fall down, advocating "replacing them with new ones when they fall"; they did not provide necessary explanations for some prejudices of the masses; and they proposed some unrealistic standards for representatives. As a result, some farmers in some villages said: "If we want to elect representatives, we can't pick one here!" In this way, the burden on grassroots cadres became heavier and heavier from the beginning, and even the leading comrades of individual work teams clearly saw that some cadres were carrying burdens, but they actually "wanted them to carry them for a few more days" instead of actively explaining and educating them.

Starting from these erroneous ideological understandings, some pilot townships generally produced the phenomenon of paternalism and substitution. At the beginning, the Dongjing Township work team did not even include township cadres in the study of universal suffrage documents. The township cadres did not know how to work, and those with concerns became even more uneasy. Individual cadres of the work team even advocated "going directly to the village for things," believing that "the role of the township government is not great." The township cadres were very dissatisfied with this, saying: "I want to come and talk to you, but I'm afraid you'll talk about our problems. If I don't come, it seems like I have nothing to do!" Some complained, saying: "With the work team, we don't need the township government!" Some work teams in the pilot townships came up with ideas and made plans, asking the township cadres to run errands and notify meetings. Some township cadres simply buried themselves in production, putting the universal suffrage work aside. Because they were separated from the grassroots cadres, the universal suffrage work was greatly affected. When the Dongjing Township universal suffrage work started, it was divorced from production, and the propaganda and education work could not be carried out either. The Yancang Township work team had difficulties in studying the materials of counter-revolutionaries because they did not understand the situation.

After encountering setbacks in their actual work and after being instructed by the local Party committees, the various work teams generally reversed this bias. The practices of Huangqiang, Dongjing, Yancang and other townships are:

First, from within the Party to outside the Party, strengthen the political and ideological education and policy education for grassroots cadres. The ideological education mainly focuses on clarifying the important significance of universal suffrage and the nature of the people's democratic regime, and enhancing the political awareness of grassroots cadres and their sense of glory in cherishing the regime and actively serving the people. Songjiang County's Dongjing Township also achieved good results by starting with enlightening cadres to recall and compare in order to improve their class consciousness. Li Fugen, the village chief of Xinglong Village in this township, did not have any land in the past. He was allocated 15.5 mu of land in the land reform. After his life improved, he buried himself in production. This time, after repeated education, he complained and criticized his own forgetful thinking, and his work became active. The policy education mainly addresses the ideological concerns of grassroots cadres, explaining the Party's cadre policy, correcting their misconception that universal suffrage is "fighting cadres," and inspiring their enthusiasm to strive for election. Ni Changming, the township head of Yancang Township, had made some mistakes in his work and originally had many concerns. After receiving education this time, he understood the Party's policy towards cadres and said excitedly: "The Party cares for and helps me in this way. I will definitely do a good job, correct my mistakes, and be a good cadre!" After eliminating his concerns, Zhang Shunyu, the director of the Farmers' Association in Gaojia Village, Dongjing Township, took active action, leading the masses to divert water to fight drought and doing a good job in production.

Second, boldly mobilize local cadres to come up with ideas and methods, actively participate in universal suffrage activities, and the work team is responsible for guidance and assistance, correcting paternalism and substitution. When reversing the bias in Dongjing Township, the work team first examined the shortcomings of paternalism and substitution, explained the overall plan of the universal suffrage work and the purpose and policies of each stage of the work to the grassroots cadres, and then boldly let the grassroots cadres grasp it. This fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the grassroots cadres. Shen Yin虎, the director of the Farmers' Association of Dongjing Township, and others studied the characteristics of the current busy farming season, took the initiative to convene a meeting of township and village cadres, and deployed all efforts to lead the masses to rush to transplant rice seedlings, using the gaps to carry out propaganda on the significance of population survey and voter registration, and as a result, the rice seedling transplanting work in the township was completed seven days earlier than last year. As soon as the rice seedling transplanting was completed, they seized the gaps and fully launched the population survey and voter registration, completing this work in three days.

Third, combined with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, educate and help grassroots cadres improve their leadership methods and styles, and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. The grassroots cadres and the broad masses of people are unclear about the boundary between violations of law and discipline and coercive orders in the implementation of work. Therefore, the work team first explained the difference between violations of law and discipline and general coercive orders, enlightened cadres to summarize the achievements and shortcomings of past work, analyzed the harm and causes and responsibilities of coercive orders, improved cadres' ideological understanding, eliminated unnecessary concerns, and consciously conducted self-criticism. Good people and good deeds were praised, and bad people and bad deeds were criticized. Then, specifically help grassroots cadres study and improve their methods of leadership. The work team helped the cadres of Qinxi Village in Yancang Township summarize their work, improved their ideological understanding, and they took the initiative to review their shortcomings, express their attitudes, and strive for the understanding of the people. On the basis of improving the ideological awareness of grassroots cadres, the work team specifically helped them study and improve their working methods, organized grassroots cadres to go deep into creating and mastering typical examples, and promoted production. Township cadre Lu Fugen said: "In the past, I was angry from three sides, but now that I have improved my work, I am happy from three sides: I am happy, my family is happy, and the masses are happy." With the help of the work team, the cadres of Xinglong Village in Dongjing Township improved the shortcomings of only talking and not doing in leading production in the past, took the lead in demonstrating, and promoted the experience of small-株方形密植. Ninety-nine percent of the more than 1,300 mu of rice fields in the village were transplanted using new or improved methods.

The grassroots cadres took the initiative to review the shortcomings in their past work, improved their leadership methods and styles, and were further supported by the masses. The farmers in Yancang Township said: "Chairman Mao is truly wise. The cadres of the People's Government know their mistakes and can review and correct them. They will do things better and better in the future." The farmers in the production village of Dongjing Township were excited to see that the style of cadres had been improved through universal suffrage, and said: "In the past, if we talked to the cadres about difficulties, the cadres would not help solve them and would complain, so we did not dare to talk to them. Now they help us think of ways to overcome difficulties. The cadres have changed, and the benefits of universal suffrage are really many!"

Although the pilot townships for universal suffrage in various counties of Songjiang Special District have attached importance to the work of mobilizing grassroots cadres, there are still problems in the guiding ideology and working methods of the work teams. In order to further completely solve these problems, the Songjiang Prefectural Committee of the CPC convened responsible cadres of the prefectural committee's pilot townships for universal suffrage and responsible cadres of the pilot townships for universal suffrage in various counties in late June to study improvement methods. At this meeting, Comrade Yang Chun of the East China Universal Suffrage Office and Comrade Li Chu of the Songjiang Prefectural Committee emphasized the important significance of mobilizing grassroots cadres, pointing out that it is necessary to truly prevent the two sentiments of kicking away and condoning from the ideological level. In order to ensure that the work of mobilizing grassroots cadres is done well, the Songjiang Prefectural Committee proposed a change in the original universal suffrage steps. The original first step of propaganda and education work can be changed to two steps: the first step focuses on conducting ideological and political education and policy education for grassroots cadres, and the second step carries out mass propaganda and education work through grassroots cadres. The original third step of nominating candidates and convening an election conference is also divided into two steps: the first step is to launch a struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline through the nomination of candidates, commend good people and good deeds, criticize bad people and bad deeds, and educate and help grassroots cadres improve their leadership styles, so as to strive for election through practical actions; the second step is to mobilize the masses to examine candidates and mobilize the masses to participate in the election conference. The Songjiang Prefectural Committee pointed out that the change in the working steps is mainly to make the leading cadres clear about the importance of mobilizing grassroots cadres to participate in the election, and to have sufficient time to do a good job in mobilizing grassroots cadres. However, it is not a rigid rule, and the pilot townships in various counties and districts can flexibly carry out the work according to the actual situation in line with the spirit of helping grassroots cadres to do a good job in the election.

    江苏省松江专区各县普选试验乡如何发动和依靠基层干部进行工作的
    范万钧
    江苏省松江专区各县普选试验乡的基层选举工作已顺利展开，其中松江县洞泾乡、南汇县盐仓乡和嘉定县黄墙乡已完成了人口调查和选民登记工作，正在酝酿选举，其他各试验乡也已进入人口调查和选民登记阶段。松江专区基层普选试验工作的经验证明，发动与依靠基层干部来做选举工作是一个极其重要的问题。
    根据盐仓乡、黄墙乡及洞泾乡的情况，基层干部有四种类型。这三个乡共有基层干部二百六十七人，其中本质好、工作积极、密切联系群众的有七十人；本质好工作作风和生活作风上有些毛病、群众基本拥护的九十五人；本质好但觉悟不高，工作不够积极的八十六人；品质恶劣、犯有违法乱纪错误或是混进革命队伍的阶级异己分子计十六人，占干部总数的百分之五点九。从这三个乡的情况可以看出，基层组织基本上是纯洁的，基层干部基本上是好的，发动与依靠基层干部作好普选工作完全可能。
    这三个乡的基层干部对普选的认识是不同的，最初有些干部有着误解，顾虑很大。一向工作积极、密切联系群众的干部有信心争取当选，但充分发扬民主的观念不明确，有的人还有一定程度的骄傲自满情绪。品质好但工作中犯有强迫命令错误的干部，顾虑很大，怕领导上一脚踢开。盐仓乡路新村村长祝金根说：“‘三反’挨不着，普选要反到头上来了！”觉悟不高的干部，觉得过去工作干不好受上级批评，生产搞不好受家庭责骂，作风不好群众有意见，是三面受气，这次普选中如被选掉，也无所谓。有的犹疑不决，如盐仓乡干部陶祥林说：“拾起来吧，手发酸；甩脱吧，舍不得！”个别违法乱纪分子对群众进行威胁利诱，有的说怪话，有的卖功劳、讲苦情，企图取得群众同情。
    松江专署普选试验乡和有些县的普选试验乡的工作组，一开始对基层干部要求过高，只看到基层干部的缺点，看不到成绩，也没有分析产生缺点的原因和责任，觉得“这些干部真不够格”；对本质很好但因在工作和生产中碰到很多实际困难而暂时消极下来的干部，是“自绝于党”“自绝于人民”，看他们跌落下去，主张“跌下去换新的”；对于某些群众的偏见，没有进行必要的解释；提出一些脱离实际的代表标准。因此有些村的农民说：“要选代表呀，我们这里一个也挑不上！”这样，一开始就使基层干部的包袱越背越重，甚至个别工作组的领导同志明明看到有些干部背上了包袱，还竟然
    “要让他多背几天”，而不去积极进行解释和教育。
    从这些错误的思想认识出发，有些试验乡就普遍地产生了包办代替现象。洞泾乡工作组一开始连学习普选文件都没有吸收乡干部参加。乡干部不知应如何工作，有顾虑的更加不安。工作组的个别干部竟主张“有事直接到村”，认为“乡政府作用不大”。乡干部对此很不满意，说：“想来和你们谈谈吧，又怕你们谈我们的问题，不来吧，好像没事做！”有的发牢骚，说：“有了工作组，乡政府不要了！”也有些试验乡的工作组出主意，订计划，让乡干部跑腿，通知开会。有的乡干部干脆埋头生产，把普选工作置于身外。因为脱离了基层干部，普选工作受到很大影响。洞泾乡普选工作开始时脱离生产，宣传教育工作也没能展开。盐仓乡工作组研究反革命分子的材料，因为不了解情况，发生了困难。
    各个工作组在实际工作中受到挫折，又经当地党委指示后，一般的都扭转了这一偏向。黄墙、洞泾、盐仓等乡的作法是：
    第一、从党内到党外，加强对基层干部的政治思想教育和政策教育。进行思想教育，主要是讲清普选的重要意义和人民民主政权的性质，提高基层干部的政治觉悟和爱护政权积极为人民服务的光荣感。松江县洞泾乡从启发干部回忆对比提高干部的阶级觉悟入手，也收到好的效果。这乡兴隆村村长李福根过去没有土地，土地改革中分到十五亩五分田，生活过好了，就埋头生产。这次经过反复教育，他诉了苦，批判了自己的忘本思想，工作积极起来。进行政策教育主要是针对基层干部的思想顾虑，说明党的干部政策，纠正他们认为普选是“斗干部”的错觉，启发他们争取当选的积极性。盐仓乡乡长倪昌明在工作中犯过一些错误，本来有不少顾虑，这次受到教育后，了解了党对干部的政策，激动地说：“党对我这样爱护帮助，我一定搞好工作改正错误，当个好干部！”洞泾乡高家村农会主任张顺余消除了顾虑之后，积极行动起来，带领群众推水抗旱，搞好了生产。
    第二、大胆发动当地干部出主意、想办法，积极参加普选活动，工作组负责指导和帮助，纠正了包办代替。洞泾乡在扭转偏向时，工作组首先检查了包办代替的缺点，把普选工作的通盘计划和各个阶段工作的目的及政策向基层干部交代清楚，然后大胆放手地让基层干部去掌握。这样就充分发挥了基层干部的积极性。洞泾乡农会主任沈寅虎等研究了当前农忙情况的特点，主动地召开了乡村干部会议，部署全力领导群众突击插秧，利用空隙进行人口调查和选民登记意义的宣传，结果使全乡插秧工作比去年提前七天完成。插秧一结束，他们就抓紧空隙，全面展开人口调查和选民登记，在三天之内就完成了这一工作。
    第三、与反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪斗争相结合，教育和帮助基层干部改进领导方法和作风，改善干部和群众的关系。基层干部与广大群众对于违法乱纪与在执行工作中所犯强迫命令错误的界限是混淆不清的，因此工作组就首先说明违法乱纪与一般的强迫命令的不同，启发干部总结过去工作的成绩和缺点，分析强迫命令的危害性和产生的原因和责任，提高干部的思想认识，扫除不必要的顾虑，自觉地进行检讨。并表扬了好人好事，批评了坏人坏事。然后再具体帮助基层干部研究改进领导工作的方法。工作组帮助盐仓乡钦西村干部总结了工作，提高了他们的思想认识，他们就纷纷主动检讨自己的缺点，表示态度，争取人民的谅解。工作组在基层干部思想觉悟提高的基础上，再具体帮助他们研究改进工作方法，组织基层干部深入创造与掌握典型，推动了生产。乡干部陆福根说：“过去是三面受气，现在改进了工作是三面高兴：自己高兴、家庭高兴、群众高兴。”洞泾乡兴隆村干部在工作组帮助下，改进了过去领导生产只讲不做的缺点，带头示范，推广了小株方形密植的经验。全村一千三百多亩稻田，百分之九十九是用新法或改良法插的秧。
    基层干部主动检查了过去工作中的缺点，改进了领导方法和作风，就进一步受到群众的拥护。盐仓乡农民说：“毛主席真英明，人民政府的干部知道了错误能检讨，能改正，今后办事情越办越好了。”洞泾乡生产村农民看到通过普选改进了干部作风，激动地说：“过去跟干部谈困难，干部不帮助解决，还发牢骚，我们就不敢和他谈了，现在却帮助我们想办法克服困难。干部变了样，普选的好处真多呀！”
    松江专区各县普选试验乡虽已重视发动基层干部的工作，但工作组指导思想和工作方法仍然存在着问题，为进一步彻底解决这些问题。中共松江地委在六月下旬先后召集地委普选试验乡负责干部和各县普选试验乡负责干部，研究改进办法。在这个会上，华东普选办公室杨纯同志和松江地委会李楚同志着重说明了发动基层干部的重要意义，指出必须真正从思想上防止一脚踢开和迁就姑息的两种情绪。为了保证做好发动基层干部的工作，对于原来的普选步骤，松江地委提出了变更办法。原定第一步宣传教育工作可改为两步进行：第一步着重对基层干部进行思想教育和政策教育，第二步通过基层干部开展群众性的宣传教育工作。原定第三步候选人提名和召开选举大会的工作也分作两步进行；第一步通过候选人提名，展开反对官僚主义命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争，表扬好人好事，批判坏人坏事，教育和帮助基层干部改进领导作风，以实际行动争取当选；第二步是发动群众审查候选人和发动群众参加选举大会。松江地委指出，变更工作步骤，主要是使领导干部明确发动基层干部参加选举的重要性，且能有充裕的时间来做好发动基层干部的工作。但并不作硬性规定，各县区试验乡可根据帮助基层干部搞好选举的精神按实际情况灵活进行。
