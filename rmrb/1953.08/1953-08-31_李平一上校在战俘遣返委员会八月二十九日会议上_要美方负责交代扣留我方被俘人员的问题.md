Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 30th – According to the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, both sides of the armistice should repatriate all prisoners of war who insist on repatriation as soon as possible before September 25th, and release all remaining prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody. The Korean and Chinese side will strictly abide by the above provisions, repatriate all United Nations forces prisoners of war in their custody who insist on repatriation, and release all remaining United Nations forces prisoners of war, about 400 in number, who, despite repeated persuasion by the Korean and Chinese side to return home, are still unwilling to be repatriated, to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. However, the United Nations forces side has not only failed to provide a responsible account for the large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war forcibly detained by them to date, but also attempted to forcibly detain another group of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who insist on repatriation after the two sides began to repatriate prisoners of war.

As is well known, after the two sides signed the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war, the Syngman Rhee government, with the deliberate connivance of the United Nations forces, forcibly detained more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Although General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations forces, claimed that he would do his best to recover them, the United Nations forces side has never provided a responsible account of how many have been recovered to date. On the other hand, Clark stated on May 27th that there were 76,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in the custody of the United Nations forces who insisted on repatriation. However, the same Clark said on June 29th that there were only 74,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation. The United Nations forces side has also never provided a responsible account for the difference of more than 2,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation in about a month. At the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee meeting on August 29th, the Korean and Chinese side once again requested the United Nations forces side to promptly provide a responsible account of the above two issues, and firmly demanded that the United Nations forces side repatriate as soon as possible all Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who insist on repatriation, whom the United Nations forces side openly intends to detain as hostages. Colonel Li Pingyi, the chief delegate of our side to the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee, pointed out:

“On August 10, 1953, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly declared that your side held a considerable number of our captured personnel, who would be detained by your side as hostages. On August 13, 1953, U.S. Army Secretary Stevens stated more specifically that your side would detain more than 250 of our captured personnel as hostages. According to the accurate materials we have, this is only a part of the captured personnel of our side that your side intends to detain. Regarding this absurd behavior of your side, which violates all international practices, the Geneva Conventions, and the Korean Armistice Agreement, our side raised it with your side at the last meeting and demanded that your side reply. For all the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, including Park Sang-hyun, Li In-cheol, Kim Tae-hoon, Shin Tae-bong, Eom Jeong-hyeop, Li Jong-jin, Li Cheol-gyun, Roh Jae-gil, and all the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, including Wu Chengde, Wang Fang, Wei Lin, Li Yan, Sun Zhenguan, Li Decai, etc., whom your side intends to detain, your side should immediately make a responsible account. We want to ask: What exactly are you going to do with these captured personnel of our side who insist on repatriation? Do you intend to repatriate them to our side as soon as possible in accordance with the Armistice Agreement? Your side should reply immediately.”

Under the repeated questioning and presentation of various conclusive evidences by the Korean and Chinese side, the United Nations forces side only stated that it was willing to be bound by the Armistice Agreement, but still avoided giving a specific reply to the above-mentioned demands of the Korean and Chinese side.

    李平一上校在战俘遣返委员会八月二十九日会议上
    要美方负责交代扣留我方被俘人员的问题
    【新华社开城三十日电】根据朝鲜停战协定的规定，停战双方应于九月二十五日前尽速将其所收容的一切坚持遣返的战俘遣返完毕，并将其余战俘全部释交中立国遣返委员会看管。朝中方面将恪守上述规定，全部遣返其所收容的一切坚持遣返的联合国军被俘人员，并将约四百名虽经朝中方面一再劝其回家，但仍不愿遣返的其余的联合国军被俘人员，一律释交中立国遣返委员会。但联合国军方面则不但迄今尚未对已被其强迫扣留的大批朝中被俘人员作负责的交代，而且在双方开始遣返战俘以后仍然企图强迫扣留又一批坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员。
    众所周知，李承晚政府于双方签订了关于战俘遣返的协议后，曾在联合国军的有意纵容下强迫扣留了二万七千余名朝中被俘人员。联合国军总司令克拉克虽曾声称他将尽力予以追回。但迄今为止，究已追回多少，则联合国军方面从未作负责的交代。另一方面，克拉克在五月二十七日曾表示：联合国军收容下坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员，有七万六千名。但同一个克拉克在六月二十九日却说：坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员只有七万四千名。联合国军方面也从未对于在一个月左右坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员竟发生了两千余名的差额一事作过负责的交代。朝中方面在八月二十九日的战俘遣返委员会会议上，再一次要求联合国军方面对上述两问题迅速加以负责的交代，并坚决要求联合国军方面尽速遣返为联合国军方面所公开企图加以扣留以为人质的所有坚持遣返的朝中被俘人员。战俘遣返委员会我方首席委员李平一上校指出：
    “一九五三年八月十日，美国国务卿杜勒斯公开宣称你方手中握有相当数量的我方被俘人员，将被你方扣留作为人质。一九五三年八月十三日，美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯更具体表示，你方将扣留二百五十余名我方被俘人员作为人质。根据我方所掌握的确切材料，这不过是你方企图扣留的我方被俘人员的一部分。关于你方这种违反一切国际惯例、日内瓦公约和朝鲜停战协定的荒谬行为，我方曾在上一次的会议上向你方提出，要求你方答复。对于被你方企图扣留的全部朝鲜人民军被俘人员包括朴相显、李仁哲、金泰勋、申泰凤、严正侠、李钟镇、李哲钧、卢在吉等人和全部中国人民志愿军被俘人员包括吴成德、王芳、魏林、李彦、孙振冠、李德才等人，你方应立即作出负责的交代。我们要问：你方究竟准备对这些坚持遣返的我方被俘人员怎样办？你方是否打算根据停战协定尽速遣交我方。你方应立即答复。”
    联合国军方面在朝中方面提出各种确凿证据并一再追问之下，仅表示它愿受停战协定的约束，但对朝中方面的上述要求仍避不作具体答复。
