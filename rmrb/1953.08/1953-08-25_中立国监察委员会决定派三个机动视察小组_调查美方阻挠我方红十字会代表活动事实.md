    中立国监察委员会决定派三个机动视察小组
    调查美方阻挠我方红十字会代表活动事实
    【新华社开城二十四日电】中立国监察委员会根据军事停战委员会的请求，二十四日决定派出三个机动中立国视察小组前往南朝鲜，就美方违反停战协定、无理阻挠和限制朝中红十字会代表活动的事件进行调查。派赴临津江桥的小组预定在二十五日上午十时出发，派赴永登浦的小组预定在二十五日上午七时出发，派赴巨济岛的小组待美方提出答复后再确定出发日期。波兰、瑞典、捷克斯洛伐克的组员，根据中立国监察委员会的规定，分别担任临津江桥组、永登浦组和巨济岛组的组长。
    机动中立国视察小组的组织，是根据中立国监察委员会二十一日通过的一项办法组成的。机动中立国视察小组组织办法的要点是：
    一、中立国监察委员会根据停战协定第四十二款的规定，设立十个机动中立国视察小组。每一中立国委员指派十个小组中的本国组员，小组的附属人员的配备则由组员之间商定。各小组的组长依派出小组的次序，分别由捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典、波兰或瑞士的组员担任。
    二、中立国监察委员会秘书处在接到军事停战委员会要求派遣机动中立国视察小组的通知后，应不迟延地通知各委员或其候补委员，以便开会商讨，作出派遣小组的决定。
    三、两个机动小组应随时作好准备，以便在接到通知后两小时内出发。小组组长将从中立国监察委员会值班秘书或值班军官处，收到军事停战委员会的书面指示，以及一切有关所调查的事件的文件。小组将以最迅速的运输工具送到指派地点。军事停战委员会或任何一方首席委员，应提供机动小组所需的交通工具，派出随小组的联络军官及护送人员。
