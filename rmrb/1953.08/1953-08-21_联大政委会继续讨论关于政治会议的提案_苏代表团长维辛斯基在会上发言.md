Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 20th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the afternoon of August 19th to continue discussing proposals on how to arrange a political conference to seek solutions to the Korean issue and related problems. At the meeting, the United States' attempt to prevent all countries with important relations to ensuring the consolidation and lasting peace in the Far East from participating in the political conference continued to be criticized.

The first speaker was Canadian representative Martin, who said: "If we want the conference to have the best opportunity to achieve satisfactory results in securing the future peace and security of this region, then our aim should be to ensure that all countries that should participate in the conference do so. How to achieve this is not important."

The Canadian representative pointed out: "Holding a conference without the participation of the Soviet Union is very unrealistic."

Martin then strongly advocated inviting India to participate in the political conference and demanded that no country important to the effective convening of the conference be prevented from participating.

Soviet delegation leader Andrei Yanuarevich Vyshinsky spoke after Martin. He emphasized the great significance of the Korean armistice and listed the necessary steps to ensure a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

After Vyshinsky's speech, U.S. representative Lodge attempted to defend his concept of opposing sides, insisting on this concept as a principle of the political conference's composition to replace the round-table conference principle advocated by Vyshinsky and many other representatives.

Lodge insisted that it was General Nam Il who firmly advocated that the members of the political conference should be limited to the two sides participating in the hostilities during the armistice negotiations. Lodge insisted that the Soviet proposal was a "discriminatory proposal" aimed at causing further confusion rather than leading to a solution to the Korean issue. He said that this proposal would put the Chinese People's Volunteers in "first class" because they have the final say on whether the agreement of the conference takes effect. South Korea, on the other hand, is placed in "second class" because it is obligated to the conference resolutions but has no decision-making power over these resolutions. Lodge also attempted to answer Vyshinsky's argument that the United States, on the eve of the political conference that will discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, concluded an agreement with South Korea to station troops in South Korea, which exposed the true intentions of the United States.

The last speaker at the August 19th meeting was the Thai representative. In his brief speech, he called for the passage of the fifteen-nation proposal that limits the members of the political conference to countries participating in the hostilities.

The Political Committee then adjourned and is scheduled to reconvene on the morning of August 20th.

    联大政委会继续讨论关于政治会议的提案
    苏代表团长维辛斯基在会上发言
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约二十日讯：联合国大会政治委员会在八月十九日下午举行会议，继续讨论关于寻求解决朝鲜问题及有关问题的政治会议应如何安排的提案。在会议上，美国阻止对保证远东的巩固与持久和平有重要关系的所有国家参加政治会议的企图，继续受到批评。
    第一个发言的是加拿大代表马丁，他说：“如果我们要使会议有最好的机会在获致这一区域未来的和平与安全方面达到圆满的结果，那么，我们的目的就是要使得所有应该参加会议的国家都参加会议。至于怎样做到这一点并不是重要的事。”
    加拿大代表指出：“举行一个没有苏联参加的会议是很不现实的。”
    然后，马丁坚决主张邀请印度参加政治会议，并要求不要阻止任何对会议开得有效有重要意义的国家参加会议。
    苏联代表团团长安·扬·维辛斯基在马丁之后发言。他强调指出朝鲜停战的重大意义，并列举保证和平解决朝鲜问题的必要步骤。
    在维辛斯基发言以后，美国代表洛奇企图为他的对立双方的概念辩护，他坚持把这个概念作为政治会议的组成原则，来代替维辛斯基和其他许多代表所主张的圆桌会议的原则。
    洛奇硬说，在停战谈判中，正是南日将军坚决主张政治会议的成员应限于参加敌对行动的双方。洛奇硬说，苏联的提案是“歧视性的提案”，其目的在于引起进一步的混乱，而不是引向朝鲜问题的解决。他说，这个提案会把中国人民志愿军列入“第一等”，因为他们对于会议的协议是否生效有最后决定权。而南朝鲜却被列入“第二等”，因为它对于会议决议负有义务，而对于这些决议并没有决定权。洛奇也企图答覆维辛斯基的这样一个论点，就是：美国在行将讨论一切外国军队从朝鲜撤退的政治会议召开的前夕，竟和南朝鲜缔结了把军队驻扎在南朝鲜的协定，这就暴露了美国的真正意图。
    在八月十九日会议上最后发言的是泰国代表。他在简短的发言中要求通过那个把政治会议的成员仅限于参与敌对行动的国家的十五国提案。
    政治委员会至此休会，定八月二十日上午再开。
