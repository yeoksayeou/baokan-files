Foreign Language School is a higher education institution (located in Beijing) that cultivates foreign language translation cadres with both moral integrity and talent, sound physique, and reading, listening, speaking, and writing skills. The school currently has four departments: English, German, French, and Spanish. The duration of study is four years. To meet the needs of national construction, the English, German, French, and Spanish departments of the school will add new classes and recruit high school graduates to participate in learning.

Since 1950, the school has systematically studied the advanced teaching experience of the Soviet Union and implemented an organized and planned teaching system. Recently, the school studied the paper on foreign language teaching methods written by Rakhmanov, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, based on Comrade Stalin's brilliant work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," as well as the "Basic Modern English Course Teaching Syllabus" stipulated by the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education, and further carried out foreign language teaching work. In terms of textbook compilation and coordination, and in the research of teaching theory and the improvement of teaching methods, new gains have been made, and the quality of teaching has been continuously improved. In addition, Soviet papers on foreign language teaching have been translated (Foreign Language Teaching Series, seven types have been published), which has also played a certain role in promoting the Soviet Union's foreign language teaching experience.

    外国语学校改进教学工作培养翻译人材
    外国语学校是培养德才兼备、体魄健全和具有读、听、说、写能力的外国语翻译干部的高等学校（校址设在北京）。全校现设英文、德文、法文和西班牙文四系。修业年限是四年。为适应祖国建设的需要，该校英、德、法、西班牙文各系都将添设新班，招高中毕业生参加学习。
    该校自一九五○年起即开始系统地学习苏联的先进教学经验，推行有组织有计划的教学制度。最近该校学习了苏联科学院通讯院士拉赫曼诺夫根据斯大林同志的天才著作“马克思主义与语言学问题”写成的关于外国语教学法的论文，以及苏联高等教育部规定的“现代英语基本教程教学大纲”，进一步开展了外国语教学工作。在教材的编撰和配合方面，在教学理论的钻研与教学方法的改进方面，都有了新的收获，使教学质量不断提高。此外，还翻译了苏联关于外国语教学方面的论文（外国语教学丛书，现已出版七种），这对推广苏联外国语教学经验也起了一定的作用。
