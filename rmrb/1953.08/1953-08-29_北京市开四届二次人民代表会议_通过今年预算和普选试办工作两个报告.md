Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: The Second Session of the Fourth Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference was held at Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park from the 24th to the 26th. The conference heard and approved two reports on Beijing's financial budget for this year and pilot work for universal suffrage.

Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, delivered a report at the meeting on the "Final Accounts of Financial Revenue and Expenditure of Beijing Municipality for 1952 and the Financial Revenue and Expenditure Budget for 1953." He pointed out that, as a result of the recovery and development of production and the strict implementation of the financial budget, both fiscal revenue and expenditure increased year by year, and the budget execution was generally good. The total revenue in 1952 (including taxes remitted to higher authorities) exceeded the budget by 12.44 percent, while the actual expenditure (excluding taxes remitted to higher authorities) was 91.12 percent of the original budget. Although the 1953 financial budget was greatly increased compared to 1952, by the end of June this year, revenue had reached 45.2 percent of the target, and actual expenditure had reached 41.51 percent of the original budget. Of this year's expenditure, economic construction expenses accounted for 48.42 percent, which was due to the need to adapt to the continuous growth of production and population, and to develop municipal construction and public utilities in Beijing on a larger scale within the limits of manpower, financial resources, technology, and experience.

Subsequently, Liu Ren, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Election Committee, reported on the pilot work for grassroots elections in Beijing and on opinions regarding future grassroots election work in Beijing. After describing the process of carrying out the pilot work for grassroots elections in Beijing, Liu Ren gave a brief explanation of some important issues in the election work. He pointed out that the principle guiding the universal suffrage work is to fully promote democracy in accordance with the provisions of the Electoral Law and ensure that voters elect representatives they deem satisfactory. From the pilot work during this period, the key to promoting democracy is the discussion of the list of candidates. The election committee must be good at leading voters to freely, fully, and repeatedly deliberate and consult on the list of candidates, and then determine the official list of candidates based on the opinions of the majority of voters. The experience of the pilot project fully proves that the method of proposing the list of candidates jointly or separately by the Chinese Communist Party, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations, or by voters jointly or individually, is democratic and correct. However, after the list of candidates is proposed, it must be fully deliberated by the voter groups, repeatedly consulted and discussed. Voter groups or individuals can propose opinions to partially or even completely change the original list of candidates. Finally, the election committee determines the official list of candidates based on the opinions of the majority of voters.

Regarding the election method, Liu Ren said that it is easier to convene election meetings in suburban areas, and at the same time, the educational level of voters is lower. Facts have proven that at present, only the method of voting by raising hands can be adopted. In the pilot area of Anfu Hutong in Xidan District in the city, because voters have various different occupations, it is not easy to gather together for meetings, and at the same time, their educational level is also higher. Therefore, in the pilot project, they adopted the method of secret ballot.

Regarding the future grassroots election work in Beijing, Liu Ren said: Preparations for comprehensive grassroots elections will begin in the city in October. Due to the complexity of the urban situation, in order to ensure the correct progress of the universal suffrage movement, it is planned to select a district to start in advance in order to further gain experience and move forward steadily. At present, a large number of cadres are first being transferred for training to welcome the start of comprehensive grassroots elections.

After group discussions, the conference began plenary speeches. The representatives unanimously agreed with the reports of Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu and Chairman Liu Ren. Many representatives put forward active opinions on how to carry out grassroots election work. In addition, the representatives spoke very enthusiastically about urban construction issues. Everyone believed that the urban construction work in Beijing had made great achievements, but there were also some shortcomings in the specific work, such as insufficient planning in municipal construction work, poor cooperation among various units, and frequent rework and poor engineering quality. The representatives also raised critical opinions on the shortcomings in this year's enrollment work for primary and secondary schools in Beijing, medical and health work, and other aspects.

Finally, Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, gave a speech. Peng Zhen said: This conference not only correctly affirmed the achievements of the Municipal People's Government's work, but also put forward many criticisms and constructive opinions on the shortcomings and mistakes in the work, which is a very good spur to the improvement of our work. Next, he analyzed and explained some specific issues raised by the representatives. He pointed out that most of the opinions and proposals put forward by the representatives this time reflect the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the people in the capital, and some of them are necessary and possible to handle today, and we must strive to do so. However, the construction of municipal administration, culture, education, and health cannot be carried out in isolation from production. It must be carried out step by step according to needs and possibilities, distinguishing between fundamentals and details, and prioritizing what is urgent. Regarding grassroots election work, he said: Democracy should be fully promoted in the elections to ensure that voters can elect the representatives they want. After briefly talking about the main tasks of this year and the current situation, he emphasized that economizing everywhere and concentrating efforts on developing production, especially industrial production, is the most central task for people from all walks of life in the capital at present.

    北京市开四届二次人民代表会议
    通过今年预算和普选试办工作两个报告
    【新华社二十八日讯】北京市第四届第二次各界人民代表会议于二十四日到二十六日在中山公园中山堂举行。会议听取并通过了关于北京市今年财政预算和普选典型试办工作的两个报告。
    北京市人民政府副市长张友渔在会上作了“北京市一九五二年度财政收支决算和一九五三年度财政收支预算”的报告。他指出，由于生产的恢复和发展，严格执行财政预算的结果，因此财政的收入和支出一年比一年增加，而预算执行情况基本上也是好的。一九五二年度总收入（包括上缴税款部分）超过了预算的百分之十二点四四，而实际支出（除去上缴税款部分）则为原预算的百分之九十一点一二。一九五三年度财政预算虽比一九五二年大大增加，但到今年六月底为止，收入已完成百分之四十五点二，实际支出也达到原预算的百分之四十一点五一。今年支出中经济建设费用占百分之四十八点四二，这是为了适应生产和人口不断增长的需要，在人力、财力和技术、经验许可的条件下，对北京市市政建设和公用事业作较大规模的发展的缘故。
    接着，北京市选举委员会主席刘仁报告了北京市基层选举典型试办工作情况和关于今后北京市基层选举工作的意见。刘仁在叙述了北京市进行基层选举典型试办工作的过程后，对于选举工作中一些重要问题作了简要说明。他指出：指导普选工作的原则是按照选举法的规定，充分发扬民主，保证选民们选出他们认为满意的代表来。从这一时期的典型试办工作来看，发扬民主的关键，是对代表候选人名单的讨论，选举委员会要善于领导选民自由地充分地反复进行酝酿和协商候选人名单，然后根据多数选民的意见，确定正式候选人名单。典型试办的经验充分证明：候选人名单采取由中国共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体联合或单独提出，也可由选民联合若干人或单独提出的办法，是民主的，正确的。但候选人名单提出后，必须经过选民小组充分酝酿，反复协商讨论，选民小组或个人可以提出部分甚至全部改变原候选人名单的意见，最后由选举委员会根据多数选民的意见，确定正式候选人名单。
    关于选举方法问题，刘仁说，在郊区召开选举大会比较容易，同时选民文化程度较低，事实证明现在只能采取举手表决的方法；在城内西单区安福胡同典型试办区，因为选民有各种各样不同职业，不容易凑在一起开会，同时他们的文化程度也较高，所以在典型试办时，他们采取了无记名投票的方法。
    关于今后北京市基层选举工作，刘仁说：全面的基层选举准备十月份在全市展开。由于城市情况十分复杂，为了保证普选运动的正确进行，准备选择一个区提前开始，以便进一步取得经验，稳步前进。目前则首先抽调大量干部加以训练，以迎接全面的基层选举的开始。
    会议经过小组讨论后，开始了大会发言。代表们一致同意张友渔副市长和刘仁主席的报告。许多代表对如何进行基层选举工作提出了积极的意见。此外，对于城市建设问题，代表们发言也非常踊跃。大家认为北京市城市建设工作是有很大成绩的，但在具体工作中也存在着一些缺点，如市政建设工作的计划性不够，各单位互相配合不好，常常发现返工与工程质量差等现象。代表们对今年北京市中小学招生工作，医药卫生工作等方面存在的缺点，也提出了批评的意见。
    会议最后由市各界人民代表会议协商委员会主席彭真讲话。彭真说：这次大会不仅正确地肯定了市人民政府工作的成绩，并且对于工作中的缺点和错误提出了许多批评和建设性的意见，这对于我们工作的改进是一种很好的鞭策。接着，他对代表们所提出的若干具体问题作了分析和说明。他指出：这次代表们提出的意见和提案大多是反映首都人民不断增长着的物质和文化需要的，其中有些是今天必需办和可能办的，我们一定要努力地办。但是市政和文教、卫生等建设不能脱离生产孤立地进行，必须根据需要与可能，分别本末和轻重缓急逐步进行。关于基层选举工作，他说：在选举中应当充分发扬民主，保证选民能选出自己所要选的人当代表。他在扼要地讲了今年的主要任务和目前形势之后，着重指出：处处节约，集中力量发展生产，特别是工业生产，乃是首都各界人民当前最中心的任务。
