    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 4th. Our correspondent reports: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 4th, the U.S. chief commissioner, Bryan, admitted that U.S. military aircraft violated the armistice agreement by intruding into our airspace on the morning of the 29th at 4:20 AM, circling and conducting reconnaissance for approximately ten minutes. Bryan expressed regret over this violation of the armistice agreement, but, using the excuse of lacking sufficient materials, denied U.S. responsibility for other similar violations of the armistice agreement.
    On July 29th, Bryan's superior, Clark, said in Honolulu: "If anyone is violating the armistice agreement, it must be the Communists." Less than a week later, Bryan admitted that it was the U.S. side that violated the armistice agreement.
    Bryan stated at the Military Armistice Commission that the U.S. forces had withdrawn from all North Korean rear areas and coastal islands stipulated in item 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    Bryan also stated at the meeting that some of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were to be handed over to our side would be wearing torn clothing because they had torn their own clothes. Bryan's statement is reminiscent of the situation when our sick and wounded prisoners of war returned in April. At that time, our sick and wounded prisoners of war revealed that the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp authorities had kept them in a state of semi-starvation for a long time, wearing tattered clothes; they were unwilling to be forced to wear new clothes on the eve of repatriation to decorate the facade for the U.S. side.
    After the adjournment of the Military Armistice Commission, the secretaries of both sides held a meeting. It is reported that neutral nation representatives expressed dissatisfaction because the noise from U.S. helicopters frequently taking off and landing near the conference room was affecting the proceedings of the neutral nations' meeting. The meeting between the secretaries of both sides was to discuss this issue.

### 在朝鲜军事停战委员会四日会议上  美方承认美国军用飞机违反停战协定

    在朝鲜军事停战委员会四日会议上
    美方承认美国军用飞机违反停战协定
    【新华社开城四日电】本社记者报道：在军事停战委员会四日会议上，美方首席委员勃里安承认美国军用飞机违反停战协定，在二十九日晨四时二十分侵入我方上空，盘旋侦察约十分钟。勃里安对这一违反停战协定的事件表示遗憾，但却以缺乏充分材料为藉口，否认美方应对之同样负责的其他类似的违反停战协定的事件。
    在七月二十九日，勃里安的上司克拉克曾在檀香山说：“如果有任何人违反停战协定，那一定是共产党。”还不到一个星期，勃里安却承认违反停战协定的是美方。
    勃里安在军事停战委员会上说，美国军队已从朝鲜停战协定十三款丑项所规定一切朝鲜北部后方及沿海岛屿撤出。
    勃里安在会上并声明，将要遣交我方的某些中国人民志愿军被俘人员将穿着撕裂的衣服，因为他们自己撕毁了自己的衣服。勃里安的声明，令人回忆起四月间我方病伤被俘人员归来时的情景。当时我方病伤被俘人员都揭露美方战俘营当局使他们长期处于半饥饿状态，穿着褴褛的衣服；他们不愿在遣返的前夕，被迫穿上新衣服来替美方装璜门面。
    在军事停战委员会休会以后，双方秘书长曾举行会议。据悉，由于美国的直升飞机在会议室附近经常起落而发出的噪音影响中立国会议的进行，中立国代表对此表示不满。双方秘书长会议就是对这一问题进行商讨。
