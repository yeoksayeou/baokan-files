(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 30th) G.M. Pushkin, a specialist from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, delivered a note to Mr. N. Bischoff, the Austrian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, on July 29th.

The note said: "In its note of June 30th of this year, the Austrian government stated:

'The Federal Government considers the method proposed by the Soviet Government for holding diplomatic negotiations on the Austrian State Treaty to be acceptable and hopes to conduct comprehensive exchanges of views in accordance with the proposed method in order to promote the speedy conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty.'

This statement from the Austrian government shows that the Austrian government welcomes the Soviet government's proposal to discuss the issue of the Austrian State Treaty through appropriate diplomatic negotiations.

However, in doing so, the Austrian government did not explain why discussions on the Austrian State Treaty have been delayed since the spring of 1952. Moreover, the Austrian government must bear responsibility for the aforementioned delay.

According to the decisions of the Potsdam Conference of 1945 and the Paris Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in June 1949, agreement has been reached on the Austrian State Treaty, except for some minor provisions. Despite this, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, in violation of the earlier understanding reached by the four countries on the draft Austrian State Treaty, put forward the so-called 'Shorter Treaty' in March 1952—the drafting of this 'treaty' was done without the participation of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government has repeatedly stated that this will not promote the resolution of the Austrian issue.

The 'Shorter Treaty' first violates the Moscow Declaration of 1943 on the Austrian issue, in which some important provisions guaranteeing the democratic rights of the Austrian people differ from the original text of the Austrian State Treaty agreed upon by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, and which has also been recognized by the Austrian government."

The note cites examples to show that the "Shorter Treaty" does not stipulate the democratic rights of the Austrian people and the armed forces they should be entitled to for self-defense.

The note continued: "It cannot be ignored that the 'Shorter Treaty' clearly violates the Potsdam decisions and the agreement reached by the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France at the meeting in June 1949—to which the Austrian government had previously expressed its agreement—on important political and economic issues in Austria. The 'Shorter Treaty' infringes upon the rights of the Soviet Union, especially regarding the so-called former German assets in Austria, which are stipulated in the aforementioned agreement and the agreed-upon terms of the Austrian State Treaty.

Based on the above, the so-called 'Shorter Treaty' cannot promote the resolution of the Austrian issue, nor can it be accepted and considered, because it violates the current four-power agreement and does not conform to the true independent interests of democratic Austria."

The note pointed out: "Since the Austrian government is trying to replace the draft Austrian State Treaty, which has basically been agreed upon, with the so-called 'Shorter Treaty' drafted by the three countries without the participation of the Soviet Union and directly violating the interests of the Soviet Union, the Austrian government should bear the same responsibility as the United States, Britain, and France for the delay in concluding the Austrian State Treaty.

In view of the foregoing, the Soviet government would be very pleased if the Austrian government could state whether it continues to support the draft 'Shorter Treaty' and whether the statement made by the Austrian government in its memorandum of July 31, 1952, is still valid—that statement said that negotiations could not continue on the draft Austrian State Treaty that had previously been substantially agreed upon."

The note concluded: "It goes without saying that withdrawing the draft 'Shorter Treaty' would allow the four countries to resume discussions on the Austrian State Treaty in order to reach an agreement on the unresolved issues related to the conclusion of the treaty."

Mr. Bischoff said that he would convey the contents of the Soviet government's note to the Austrian government.

### 苏联政府就对奥和约问题照会奥地利政府

    苏联政府就对奥和约问题照会奥地利政府
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科七月三十日讯：七月二十九日苏联外交部专员格·马·普希金以照会一份交给奥地利驻苏联大使纳·比萧夫先生。
    照会说：“奥地利政府在今年六月三十日的照会中说：
    ‘联邦政府认为苏联政府所建议的就对奥和约举行外交谈判的办法是可以接受的，并希望按照所建议的办法进行全面的交换意见，以促使对奥和约迅速缔结。’
    从奥地利政府的这一表示可以看出：奥地利政府是欢迎苏联政府所提出的通过适当的外交谈判来讨论对奥和约问题的建议的。
    不过，奥地利政府在这样做的时候并没有说明为什么自一九五二年春季以来迟迟不讨论对奥和约问题。而且，上述拖延的责任也要由奥地利政府来负。
    根据一九四五年波茨坦会议的决定，以及一九四九年六月美、英、法、苏外长巴黎会议的决定，在对奥和约上，除了一些次要的条文外，已经得到了一致的意见。尽管这样，美、英、法政府竟违反四国早先在对奥和约草案上获得的谅解，在一九五二年三月提出了所谓‘简要条约’——这个‘条约’的起草工作是没有苏联参加的，而且苏联政府一再表示这并不能促使奥地利问题得到解决。
    ‘简要条约’首先违反了一九四三年关于奥地利问题的莫斯科宣言，其中一些重要的保证奥地利人民民主权利的条文，与英、美、法、苏四国所协议的、过去也为奥地利政府所承认的对奥和约条文的原文有出入。”
    照会举例说明“简要条约”没有规定奥地利人民的民主权利和应享有的自卫的武装力量。
    照会接着说：“不容忽视的是：‘简要条约’显然违反了波茨坦决定，以及苏联、美国、英国、法国四国外长在一九四九年六月的会议上达成的——奥地利政府以前也表示同意的关于奥地利的重要政治、经济问题的协议。‘简要条约’侵犯了苏联的权利，特别是关于所谓前德国在奥地利的资产的权利，这种权利是上述协议和已协议的对奥和约条款所规定的。
    根据上述情况，所谓‘简要条约’不能促使奥地利问题得到解决，也不能予以接受并加以考虑，因为它违反了现在的四国协议，也不符合民主奥地利的真正独立的利益。”
    照会指出：“由于奥地利政府力图以三国在没有苏联参加的情况下拟定的、并直接违反苏联利益的所谓‘简要条约’来代替已在基本上获得协议的对奥和约草案，奥地利政府应与美国、英国、法国政府为对奥和约的迟迟不得缔结负同等的责任。
    鉴于以上所述，奥地利政府假如能说明它是否继续支持‘简要条约’草案，说明奥地利政府在一九五二年七月三十一日的备忘录中所作的声明是否仍然有效——该声明说，根据早先已在基本上获得协议的对奥和约草案不可能继续进行谈判——，苏联政府将是很欣慰的。”
    照会最后说：“不待说，撤回‘简要条约’草案会使四国恢复讨论对奥和约，以便在有关缔结和约中没有解决的问题上达成协议。”
    比萧夫先生说，他将把苏联政府照会内容转达奥地利政府。
