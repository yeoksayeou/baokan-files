Guangdong Province has vigorously publicized and implemented production policies in various regions, initially stabilizing rural production relations after the land reform, increasing the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, and overcoming various natural disasters. The early rice harvest has been bountiful, and summer plowing and planting are underway intensely.

Guangdong Province only concluded its land reform work throughout the province before the spring plowing this year. During the transition period from land reform to production, many cadres still used methods such as "struggle" and "settlement of accounts" against the enemy in land reform to solve the production and living difficulties of poor and hired farmers. When organizing mutual aid teams, regardless of the masses' level of awareness, they blindly pursued numbers and advanced forms, adopting the method of "centralized mobilization and expanded connection," launching them all at once. When mobilizing loans, they believed that not repaying loans was "having a standpoint." They held a one-sided view of poor and hired farmers, thinking that "it's okay for poor and hired farmers to take advantage of middle peasants in everything," saying that "poor and hired farmers cannot reach socialism without squeezing oil from middle peasants." Therefore, they used methods such as lining up, checking rice bins, and investigating family assets to forcibly borrow from farmers with surplus grain and money. With such thinking among the cadres, the masses' thinking became even more chaotic, universally taking pride in being poor, saying "a thousand pieces of gold cannot buy a poor or hired peasant," arbitrarily occupying other people's cattle and farm tools. Middle and rich peasants feared revealing their wealth, feared being confiscated, feared a "second land reform," and were uneasy. As a result, unhealthy trends grew, idlers became active, theft flourished, social order was chaotic, and no one was in the mood to produce. After the issuance of land certificates in Fengliang District, Fengshun County, seventy-one farming households with labor power were not actively engaged in production. Facing difficult lives, they sold land, even selling it all and eating it all, sitting and waiting for loans, eating and drinking extravagantly, not engaging in production, and waiting for "socialism."

Many regional leading organs, according to the instructions of the South China Sub-bureau of the CPC, regarded publicizing and implementing production policies and stabilizing new production relations as the central link in the current rural work. This approach quickly produced good results. For example, in the Xie Baokun mutual aid team in Chao'an County, before the policy publicity, it took more than ten days to remove more than one hundred catties of barnyard grass; after the policy publicity, more than three hundred catties were removed in three days. Some farmers took back fields that they had previously abandoned. Farmers in Lixian and Xihu villages in Haikang County also opened up one hundred acres of wasteland. New lending relationships have also begun to be established. In the past, farmers said, "Borrowing pigs from a tiger, there is borrowing but no repayment"; now they say, "Borrowing and repaying, it is not difficult to borrow again." In Xinlongxia Village, Chaoyang County, only sixty-eight households had lent money in more than a year; after explaining the policy of free lending and repayment, forty-seven households lent money in just ten days.

Mutual aid teams have also shown a new atmosphere. For example, in Licuo Township, Chenghai County, there were eighty-three mutual aid teams, owning a total of ninety-six cattle, of which seventy-eight were publicly owned by the mutual aid teams. In the past, because everyone only cared about using them and not raising them, many cattle were starved. Some simply sold the cattle. Furthermore, collective work was required for both large and small tasks, and no work points were recorded; some farmers had no food or firewood at home and had to work with others. After publicizing the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, some teams readjusted the method of evaluating work and recording points, and some unqualified permanent mutual aid teams voluntarily changed to temporary mutual aid teams. After the rectification, the enthusiasm of the team members for production was improved, and the masses' erroneous views on mutual aid teams were changed.

During the spring and summer famines, many farmers were unclear about the policies and falsely reported famine conditions. For example, 306 households in Nanli Township, Chaoyang County, reported a "grain shortage of 137,000 catties," but actually only lacked 22,000 catties. Weng Xingzhou, a poor peasant in Yiying Township, reported a grain shortage for one month, but actually had one dan of grain lent to others. After publicizing the policy of production for self-salvation, the farmers' emotions of relying on relief and blindly shouting about famine were reversed.

After implementing production policies, the masses' enthusiasm for fighting various natural disasters also increased. For example, in the first district of Chao'an County, after clarifying the farmers' confused thinking, the entire district repaired forty-four water conservancy projects, basically changing the long-standing phenomenon of "flooding in rain and drought in little rain." At the same time, the farmers in the district actively accumulated more than 850,000 dan of fertilizer, solving the difficulty of fertilizer shortage, making the average yield of early rice in the district increase by 35% this year, more than 1.5 million catties of grain than last year's early rice.

In the process of publicizing and implementing production policies in Guangdong Province, the first step was to firmly grasp the key to unifying the ideological understanding of the cadres. In the past, some people dared not publicize the policy of protecting private property rights to farmers, saying "farmers are inherently selfish, and publicizing the protection of private property will only make them more selfish!" They considered it "justified" to infringe upon the interests of middle peasants and force loans, and did not see the serious situation of production relations being unstable due to the infringement of private property rights. Some people blindly believed that "farmers are producing because they have been allocated land, they won't have any worries." Some people were not content with rural work, asking to return to the city or switch to industry, neglecting the leadership of agricultural production. With the cadres' thinking so chaotic, it was of course impossible to clarify the thinking of the masses; many of the masses' confused thoughts often came from the cadres. After the South China Sub-bureau of the CPC held an enlarged meeting in April, various localities conveyed the resolutions of the meeting, organized cadres to study the three central documents on agricultural production, and combined the local reality to conduct inspections and criticisms of their work. After Chenghai County unified the ideological understanding of the county and district-level cadres, it further educated the village cadres, making everyone aware of the serious situation of unstable rural production relations. The township head of Licuo Township took the initiative to review his past mistakes in dealing with incidents of infringing on private property rights at the meeting. He said: I used to think that "it's okay for poor and hired farmers to take advantage of everything," but now I realize that if we continue like this, there will be more and more idlers in the countryside, and as a result, no one will be in the mood to produce. Many township heads in Yangjiang County, Yuexi District, reviewed their past organization of mutual aid teams, focusing only on occupying the cattle and farm tools of middle peasants to solve the difficulties of poor and hired farmers, forgetting voluntary mutual benefit, resulting in a decline in the production enthusiasm of middle peasants, which was also detrimental to poor and hired peasants. Some cadres in Chao'an County said, "I was muddle-headed for two or three months, and now I finally figured it out!"

In the process of publicizing the policies, various localities also paid attention to correctly implementing the policies, commending good people and good deeds according to the different situations in different regions and seasons, and dealing with outstanding examples of violating policies and sabotaging production, letting village cadres use their own experiences to educate the masses. Various localities in the Yuexi District concentrated on problems from bottom to top, analyzed and discussed the nature of the problems exposed at cadre meetings by comparing them with the policies, and then systematically solved them from top to bottom, avoiding the phenomenon of mechanically copying and finding fault. Some areas only made general publicity and did not deal with specific problems according to the local conditions, as a result, the masses still did not believe in the policies. Some areas neglected the education of poor and hired farmers in the implementation of policies, causing dissatisfaction among poor and hired farmers. Some people said, "The government's policy has changed. The government loved poor and hired farmers during the land reform, but now the government loves middle peasants." "Middle peasants are lucky!" "The policy is good, but poor and hired farmers are being suppressed." Facts show that farmers' ideological concerns are diverse and complex, and it is necessary to repeatedly educate them in practice and specifically and correctly deal with specific problems, in order to gradually dispel their ideological concerns.

### 广东省贯彻政策提高了农民生产积极性

    广东省贯彻政策提高了农民生产积极性
    广东省各地大力宣传贯彻生产政策，初步稳定了土地改革后农村的生产关系，提高了广大农民的生产积极性，战胜了多种自然灾害；早稻已经得到丰收，夏耕夏种正在紧张地进行。
    广东省在今年春耕前才结束全省的土地改革工作。在由土地改革转入生产的过渡时期，许多干部仍然搬用土地改革中对敌“斗争”、“清算”等办法来解决贫雇农民生产、生活上的困难。在组织互助组时，不管群众的觉悟水平如何，盲目追求数字，追求高级形式，采用“集中发动，扩大串连”的办法，一轰而起。发动借贷，则认为借了不还才是“有立场”。他们有片面的贫雇农观点，“事事让贫雇农占些便宜就好”，说“贫雇农不揩中农的油就到不了社会主义”。因此，对有余粮余钱的农民，就采用排队、查米缸、摸家底的办法进行强借。干部思想如此，群众的思想就更加混乱，普遍以穷为荣，说“千金难买贫雇农”，任意占用人家的耕牛、农具。中农、富农则怕露富、怕归公、怕
    “二次土改”，惶惶不安。这样，歪风滋长，二流子活跃，偷窃横生，社会秩序混乱，谁也无心生产。丰顺县丰良区发土地证以后，有七十一户农民有劳动力而不积极生产，生活困难，就出卖土地，甚至卖光吃光，坐等贷款，大吃大喝，不务生产，等待“社会主义”。
    许多地区领导机关根据中共华南分局的指示，把宣传贯彻生产政策、稳定新的生产关系作为当前农村工作的中心环节。这样做很快就发生了很好的效果。如潮安县谢保昆互助组，在宣传政策前，十多天才除稗草一百多斤；宣传政策后，三天内就除了三百多斤。有的农民把过去不要的田又要回来了；海康县李先、西湖两个村的农民还开了一百亩荒地。新的借贷关系也开始建立起来了。过去农民说：“老虎借猪，有借无还”；现在则说：“有借有还，再借不难”。潮阳县新龙下村，一年多来只有六十八户借出钱来；经向农民说明借贷自由有借有还的政策后，仅十天借出钱的就有四十七户。
    互助组也出现了新气象。如澄海县李厝乡，原有八十三个互助组，共占有耕牛九十六头，其中有七十八头是互助组公有的。过去因为大家都是只管用不管养，把许多耕牛饿坏了。有的干脆把牛卖掉了。并且不管大、小活都要集体干，也不对工记账；有的农民家里没饭吃、没柴烧，还得跟人家一起劳动。经过宣传自愿互利的政策以后，有些组重新调整了评工记分办法，有些不够条件的常年互助组自动改成了临时互助组。经过整顿以后，提高了组员的生产积极性，改变了群众对互助组的错误看法。
    在春荒、夏荒期间，许多农民对政策不摸底，虚报荒情。如潮阳县南里乡三百零六户报“缺粮十三万七千斤”，实际上只缺二万二千斤；义英乡贫农翁兴洲，自报缺粮一个月；但实际上却有一石谷借给别人。经过宣传生产自救的政策后，扭转了农民依赖救济、盲目叫荒的情绪。
    贯彻生产政策以后，群众与各种自然灾害作斗争的热情也高涨了起来。如潮安县第一区在澄清农民的混乱思想以后，全区修好了四十四宗水利，基本上改变了长期以来“天雨便涝，少雨便旱”的现象；同时，全区农民自己积极积肥八十五万多担，解决了缺肥的困难，使全区今年早稻平均增产百分之三十五，比去年的早稻多收了一百五十多万斤谷。
    广东省在宣传贯彻生产政策中，首先抓紧了统一干部的思想认识这个关键。过去，有些不敢向农民宣传保护私有财权的政策，说“农民本来就自私，再宣传保护私有财产就更自私了！”他们对侵犯中农利益、强迫借贷认为是“理所应该”，看不见因侵犯私有财权所引起的生产关系不稳定的严重情况。有些人盲目地认为：“农民分到了田就是为了生产，不会有顾虑。”有些人不安心农村工作，要求回城市、转工业，忽视对农业生产的领导。干部的思想这样混乱，当然就无法澄清群众的思想；群众的许多混乱思想，往往是从干部那里接受来的。在中共华南分局四月扩大会议后，各地传达了会议的决议，组织干部学习了中央有关农业生产的三个文件，联系当地的实际情况对工作进行了检查批判。澄海县统一了县、区级干部的思想认识后，进而教育乡村干部，使大家认识到农村生产关系不稳定的严重情况。李厝乡乡长在会上主动检讨了自己过去在处理侵犯私有财权事件中所犯的错误。他说：以前以为“事事贫雇农沾光就好”，现在认识到：如果再这样下去，农村二流子就会越来越多，结果谁也无心生产。粤西区阳江县许多乡的乡长都检讨了过去组织互助组，一心只想占用中农的耕牛农具来解决贫雇农的困难，而忘记了自愿互利，结果使中农生产情绪低落；对贫雇农也不利。潮安县有的干部说：“昏头昏脑搞了两三个月，现在才算摸到门路了！”
    各地在宣传政策中，并注意正确地执行政策，根据不同地区不同季节的不同情况，表扬好人好事，处理突出的违反政策、破坏生产的事例，让乡村干部现身说法，教育群众。粤东区各地自下而上地集中问题，在干部会上把暴露出来的问题分别性质对照政策进行分析讨论，然后再从上而下地有系统地予以解决，避免了硬搬硬套、无事找事的现象。有些地区只作了一般的宣传，没有根据当地的具体情况处理具体问题，结果群众仍然不相信政策。也有些地区在贯彻执行政策中，忽视了对贫雇农民的教育，引起贫雇农民的不满。有些人说：“政府政策变了，土地改革中政府爱贫雇农，现在政府爱中农。”“中农红运了！”“政策是好，但是贫雇农被压下去了。”事实说明：农民的思想顾虑是多样而复杂的，必须用实际反复进行教育并具体地正确地处理具体问题，才能逐步地解除他们的思想顾虑。
