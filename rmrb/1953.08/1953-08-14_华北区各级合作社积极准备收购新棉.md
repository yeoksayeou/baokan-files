Cooperatives at All Levels in North China Actively Prepare to Purchase New Cotton

    The cotton marketing season is approaching, and cooperatives at all levels in North China are actively preparing to purchase new cotton.
    North China's cotton production ranks first in the country. This year, the cotton planting area in the region is approximately the same as last year, and the estimated yield per unit area will increase. According to preliminary estimates, Hebei Province will increase production by about 3.9% compared to last year. New cotton will be harvested and marketed successively in late August. Currently, cooperatives in North China are working intensely on preparations for cotton procurement. Preliminary procurement plans have been formulated based on the needs of the textile industry and the potential increase in cotton production. At the same time, to meet the needs of cotton farmers for various means of production and daily necessities after selling cotton, state-owned commercial systems throughout the region have expanded their material supply plans for the third and fourth quarters. Hebei Province plays a crucial role in national cotton procurement, and the province's trade departments have already made preparations for materials.
    In May and June, cooperatives in various provinces of North China began training cotton inspection and grading personnel. Cooperatives in various special districts of Hebei Province have generally trained inspection personnel. The total number of cotton inspection and grading personnel in the region has reached more than 4,000. Local cotton, yarn, and cloth companies and the North China Fiber Inspection Bureau have also paid attention to training cotton inspection and grading cadres. At the same time, the North China Cooperative General Office, together with the North China Fiber Inspection Bureau and other units, established a Cotton Grade Standard Imitation Committee, which imitated a large number of samples based on the cotton grading standards. These samples will be supplied to each cotton purchasing station as a standard for their grading, to purchase high-quality cotton and supply the textile industry.
    In order to process the purchased seed cotton into ginned cotton as soon as possible, cooperatives in various regions are now focusing on processing preparations. At present, the region's primary cotton purchasing units of cooperatives at all levels have signed processing contracts with 678 state-owned, cooperative, and private cotton processing plants. These processing plants have more than 3,700 powered cotton gins and 48,600 manual cotton gins. The North China Cooperative General Office also invited major processing plants to hold a region-wide processing technology seminar to study and improve processing technology issues. Many processing plants also held processing technology seminars within the factory to study processing technologies to ensure cotton quality. (Xinhua News Agency)

    华北区各级合作社积极准备收购新棉
    棉花上市的季节快要到了，华北区各级合作社正积极准备收购新棉。
    华北区棉产量占全国第一位，今年全区种植棉花的面积约与去年相等，估计单位面积产量将有所提高，据初步调查估计，河北省约比去年增产百分之三点九。八月下旬新棉即将陆续收摘、上市。现在，华北区合作社正紧张地进行收棉的准备工作，根据纺织工业的需要和棉花可能增产的情况已拟订了初步收购计划。同时，为了满足棉农售棉后对各种生产资料和生活资料的需要，全区国营商业系统都扩大了三、四季度的物资供应计划。河北省棉花收购在全国占着极重要的地位，该省贸易部门也早已进行了物资准备。
    五、六月间，华北各省合作社即开始训练棉花检验分级人员，河北省各专区合作社已普遍训练了检验人员。全区棉花检验分级人员已达四千多人。各地花纱布公司和华北区纤维检验局也都注意了训练棉花检验分级干部。同时，华北合作总社会同华北区纤维检验局等单位成立棉花品级标准仿制委员会，根据棉花分级标准仿制了大批样品。这些样品将供给各购棉站以便作为他们分级的标准，收购质地优良的棉花，供应纺织工业用棉。
    各地合作社为了尽快把收购的籽棉加工成皮棉，现已重视加工的准备工作。目前全区各级合作社原棉收购单位，已和国营、合作社、私营的六百七十八个棉花加工厂签订了加工合同，这些加工厂拥有三千七百多台动力轧花机，四万八千六百台人力轧花机。华北合作社总社并邀请主要的加工厂举行了全区性的加工技术座谈会，研究改进加工技术问题，很多加工厂在厂内也举行加工技术座谈会，研究保证棉花质量的加工技术。  （新华社）
