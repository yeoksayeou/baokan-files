Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 17th. The first group of 2,031 former POWs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning to the motherland arrived in Andong on the morning of the 16th. After a short rest, they transferred to sanatoriums for recuperation.

The returnees received a warm welcome from the people of Andong City. As the train carrying them crossed the Yalu River Bridge and slowly entered the station through a huge red archway, the band played songs such as "Ode to the Motherland," and people from all walks of life who came to welcome them waved flags, applauded, and waved to the returnees on the train. The returnees, with tears in their eyes, excitedly sang revolutionary songs and shouted slogans.

After the train stopped, representatives from the Liaodong Provincial People's Government, the Andong Municipal People's Government, the Andong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and various people's organizations boarded the train and shook hands with the returnees. The welcoming crowd immediately sent chicken cakes and biscuits onto the train and handed cups of boiled water to the returnees. The returnees ate the exquisite pastries of the motherland, their faces filled with happy smiles. One returnee said, "Thank you to the people of the motherland for your warm care and reception. I will never forget my first meal back in the motherland!"

The returnees and the welcoming people had cordial conversations on the train. They angrily denounced the atrocities of the American imperialists in mistreating prisoners of war and recounted their stories of struggle in the POW camps. They also sang the song "The Red Flag of October 1st" for the welcomers. This heroic and tragic song was written by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war last year to commemorate their heroic struggle in celebrating the National Day of the motherland. The welcoming people told the returnees about the large-scale construction of the motherland in recent years. They were very excited. They all expressed that after returning to the motherland and recovering, they would work hard to participate in the construction of the motherland.

As the train was about to leave the station, the welcoming people tied colorful ribbons to the train and placed flowers in the carriages, congratulating them on their early recovery. The returnees had been subjected to long-term torture by the enemy in the POW camps and were physically weak. Some suffered from serious illnesses and injuries. After they go to the recuperation areas, they will receive the best care and medical treatment.

Xinhua News Agency, Andong: The second group of 1,650 former POWs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who were repatriated returned to Andong City, the motherland, at midnight on the 16th and took a train to the rear for recuperation.

On the night of the 16th, it was raining heavily here, and the people of Andong City braved the rain to warmly welcome the returned POWs of the Volunteer Army. Representatives from the Andong Municipal People's Government, the Andong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and various people's organizations, as well as many welcomers, went to each carriage to express their cordial greetings to the returned POWs of the Volunteer Army. The returned POWs of the Volunteer Army were moved to tears, and they kept shouting slogans such as "Thank you for the cordial care of the people of the motherland!"

    志愿军前被俘人员两批返国受到热情接待
    【新华社安东十七日电】第一批返回祖国的中国人民志愿军前被俘人员二千零三十一人，于十六日晨抵达安东，稍事休息后，即转往疗养地区休养。
    归来人员受到安东市人民热情的接待。当载着他们的火车越过鸭绿江大桥，通过巨大的红色牌楼徐徐进入车站时，乐队高奏“歌唱祖国”等歌曲，前往欢迎的各界人民热情地向车上的归来人员摇旗、鼓掌、招手。归来人员激动地流着眼泪高唱革命歌曲，高呼口号。
    车停以后，辽东省人民政府、安东市人民政府、中共安东市委员会和各人民团体的代表都登车与归来人员一一握手。欢迎群众马上把鸡蛋糕、饼干送上车去，又端着一杯一杯的开水递到归来人员的手中。归来人员吃着祖国精美的点心，脸上都浮泛着幸福的微笑。一个归来人员说：“感谢祖国人民对我们的热情关怀和接待，我一生也忘不了回到祖国的第一餐！”
    归来人员和欢迎的人们在车上亲切的谈心，他们愤怒地控诉美帝国主义虐待战俘的暴行，和叙述着他们在战俘营中的斗争故事，并且为欢迎者歌唱了“十月一日的红旗”歌。这首英勇悲壮的歌曲，是中国人民志愿军被俘人员在去年为纪念他们庆祝祖国国庆时所进行的英勇斗争而作的。欢迎的人们向归来人员叙述了祖国近年来大规模建设的情形。他们非常兴奋。他们都表示：回到祖国，养好身体后，一定要努力参加祖国建设。
    当火车将离站时，欢迎的人们在火车上扎上彩条，在车厢里插上鲜花，并祝贺他们早日恢复健康。归来人员在战俘营中长期受敌人摧残，身体衰弱，有的病、伤严重，他们前往休养地区后，将获得最好的调理和医疗。
    据新华社安东讯：被遣返的中国人民志愿军前被俘人员第二批一千六百五十人在十六日午夜返抵祖国安东市，乘车转往后方休养。
    十六日夜，这里下着大雨，安东市人民冒雨热情地欢迎归国的志愿军被俘人员。安东市人民政府、中共安东市委员会和各人民团体的代表及许许多多欢迎的人们都到每一车厢向归国的志愿军被俘人员亲切慰问。归国的志愿军被俘人员都激动地流泪，他们不断高呼：“感谢祖国人民亲切的关怀！”等口号。
