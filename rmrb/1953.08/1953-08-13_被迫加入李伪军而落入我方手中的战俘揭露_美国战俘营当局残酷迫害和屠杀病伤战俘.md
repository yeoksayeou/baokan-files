Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 11th: American POW camp authorities, in violation of the Geneva Convention, subjected even sick and wounded POWs to cruel persecution and massacre. In the hospital of the 64th Enclosure of the Koje Island POW camp, American "doctors," under the guise of treatment, treated sick POWs as sacrifices for dissection and drug experimentation. The surgeries performed by these American "doctors" usually took several times longer than necessary, and most patients died or became disabled after being operated on by them. In the spring of 1952, American "doctors," in order to experiment with a new dysentery drug, intentionally spread dysentery and aggravated the condition of patients suffering from dysentery. After POWs died as a result of such experiments, they dissected the corpses and continued the experiments. As a result, sick and wounded POWs in this hospital constantly refused to be diagnosed and operated on by American "doctors," and instead demanded treatment by captured Korean and Chinese medical personnel. However, the American "doctors" still used various threats to force them to accept "treatment."

Kim Seong-tae, a captured soldier of the Korean People's Army, witnessed these atrocities firsthand. After being captured, he worked as a handyman in the hospital of the 64th Enclosure of the Koje Island POW camp from August 1951 to March 1952. Kim Seong-tae was later forced to join the ROK army and fell into our hands.

According to Kim Seong-tae, in April 1952, the American side conducted forced "screening," killing and wounding many POWs in the 64th Enclosure of the Koje Island POW camp. When the wounded POWs were sent to the hospital of the enclosure, the hospital负责人(fù zé rén, person in charge) ROK Special Agent Shin Chang-ho, etc., refused to admit them. The wounds of these injured POWs gradually festered, but they still did not receive any treatment, and some POWs died as a result.

Last May, the American side cut off food supplies to 8,000 sick and wounded POWs in the Busan POW camp who resisted forced "screening" for nine days, and later killed and wounded 86 POWs; this was something the American side was forced to admit. Last April, the U.S. military killed one sick POW and wounded several others with hand grenades in the 10th POW camp on Koje Island, and cut off food supplies to sick POWs in three enclosures; this was revealed by the American-controlled "International Committee of the Red Cross" in a collection of documents. On August 15, 1951, in the hospital of the 6th Enclosure in Busan, because sick and wounded POWs sang songs to commemorate the anniversary of the liberation of their motherland, the American side opened fire and killed two POWs and wounded eight; this is one of the many incidents reported by POWs forced to act as airborne special agents that the American side has been concealing.

According to many POWs who were forced to join the ROK army and fell into our hands, Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang gang special agents frequently beat and cursed sick and wounded POWs in the hospital, deducted and embezzled their already meager rations and daily necessities, openly robbed POWs of their personal belongings, and even raped sick and wounded female POWs. In the hospital of the 64th Enclosure of the Koje Island POW camp, POWs slept on tattered straw mats and were not even given enough to eat of a mixture of wheat and soybeans every day. POWs with milder conditions were forced to perform various kinds of labor. Due to this poor treatment, a large number of sick and wounded POWs died. Last January, ROK special agents even stripped the clothes off many POWs and sold them, resulting in the death of many sick and wounded from cold and hunger.

Sick and wounded POWs constantly struggled to protest the American side's poor treatment in violation of the Geneva Convention, and the American side was also forced to reveal these messages many times. For example, last May, sick and wounded POWs in the Koje Island POW hospital went on a hunger strike to protest the American side's poor treatment. However, many incidents are still being concealed by the American side. For example, in October 1951, more than 300 POWs in the POW hospital of the 6th Enclosure in Busan submitted a petition demanding the abolition of special agent terror, improvement of treatment and living conditions, and a ban on beating and abusing POWs, etc. However, the American POW camp authorities not only rejected these demands, but also immediately began to cut off the POWs' food supply, arrested POW representatives, and finally expelled all the POWs, including the seriously injured and sick, from the hospital and escorted them to Koje Island.

    被迫加入李伪军而落入我方手中的战俘揭露
    美国战俘营当局残酷迫害和屠杀病伤战俘
    【新华社开城十一日电】美国战俘营当局违反日内瓦公约，甚至对伤病战俘也实行残酷的迫害和屠杀。在美方巨济岛战俘营第六十四号营场的病院内，美国“医师”用治疗的名义，把生病的战俘当作解剖和药品实验的牺牲品。这些美国“医师”进行手术的时间，通常都比一般需要的时间多好几倍，而且经过美国“医师”进行手术后，大部分病人都死亡或变成残废。一九五二年春季，美国“医师”们为了实验一种新的痢疾药品，有意使痢疾蔓延，并且使患痢疾的病人病情加剧。战俘因这样的实验而死亡后，他们就解剖尸体，继续实验。因此，这个病院的伤病战俘不断地拒绝美国“医师”诊断开刀，而要求由被俘的朝中医疗人员来治疗。但是美国“医师”仍然用各种威胁手段硬要给他们“治病”。
    亲眼看到美方这些暴行的是朝鲜人民军被俘人员金星泰。他在被俘以后，自一九五一年八月至一九五二年三月，曾在巨济岛战俘营第六十四号营场病院内充当杂役。金星泰后来被迫加入李伪军而落入我方手中。
    据金星泰说，一九五二年四月，美方因为进行强迫“甄别”，打死打伤了巨济岛战俘营第六十四号营场的许多战俘。当受伤的战俘被送到该营场病院时，病院负责人李匪特务申昌浩等竟拒绝收容。这些受伤战俘的创口后来逐渐溃烂，但仍然得不到任何治疗，有的战俘因此而死亡。
    去年五月，美方对釜山战俘营中抗拒强迫“甄别”的八千名伤病战俘断绝食粮达九天之久，后来又打死打伤战俘八十六名；这是美方曾经被迫承认过的。去年四月，美军在巨济岛第十号战俘营用手榴弹炸死病俘一名，炸伤数名，并对三个营场中的病俘断绝食粮供应；这是美方的御用机关“红十字国际委员会”在一本文件集中透露的。一九五一年八月十五日，在釜山第六号营场的病院内，因为伤病战俘唱歌纪念祖国解放日，美方就开枪打死战俘二名，打伤八名；这是被迫充当空降特务的战俘所报告而为美方一直隐瞒着的许多事件之一。
    据许多被迫加入李伪军而落入我方手中的战俘说，李承晚和国民党匪帮特务在病院内经常打骂伤病战俘，克扣和贪污他们本来就少得可怜的粮食和日用品，公开抢劫战俘的私人物件，甚至于强奸伤病的女战俘。在巨济岛战俘营第六十四号营场的病院内，战俘都睡在破烂的草席上，每天连麦子黄豆掺杂的饭也吃不饱。病情较轻的战俘还被强迫进行各种劳动。由于这种恶劣待遇，伤病战俘大量死亡。去年一月，李匪特务甚至于把许多战俘身上穿的衣服剥去出卖，结果有不少伤病员冻饿而死。
    伤病战俘不断为抗议美方违反日内瓦公约的恶劣待遇而斗争，美方也曾多次被迫透露这些消息。例如去年五月，巨济岛战俘医院的伤病战俘曾绝食抗议美方的恶劣待遇。但是仍有许多事件至今被美方隐瞒着。例如，一九五一年十月，釜山第六号营场的战俘病院内，三百多名战俘曾提出请愿书，要求取消特务恐怖，改善治疗和生活待遇，不准打骂和虐待战俘等。但是美方战俘营当局不仅拒绝这些要求，而且立即开始断绝战俘伙食，逮捕战俘代表，最后并把包括重伤病员在内的全体战俘逐出医院，押送到巨济岛去。
