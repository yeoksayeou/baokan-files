Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 27th: Korean public opinion unanimously supports the Soviet proposal and the statements of the Chinese and Korean governments regarding the political conference issue, advocating that the political conference must become a conference for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The Korean Central News Agency published an editorial on August 27th entitled "The Korean People Firmly Support the Soviet Proposal on the Political Conference Issue," stating: "Our Korean people, along with all peace-loving people around the world, are watching the United Nations General Assembly's discussion on the composition of the political conference. The Korean people are concerned about this because the political conference will discuss the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea and the issue of peacefully resolving the Korean problem. People around the world are concerned about this because whether the Korean problem can be resolved peacefully is closely related to maintaining and consolidating peace in the Far East and the world."

The commentary pointed out: "Currently, there are two completely opposite lines within the United Nations Political Committee. One is the Soviet Union's line of peaceful policy; the other is the United States' line of war policy. The Soviet Union advocates that the political conference should take the form of a 'round table conference,' with participation from both belligerent parties and countries concerned with the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; while the United States stubbornly adheres to the view that the political conference should only be attended by the belligerent parties. The Soviet Union also proposed that any decision of the political conference must be adopted with the unanimous consent of both sides of the Korean armistice. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union's proposition is the most just and reasonable; conversely, the discussion process of the United Nations Political Committee has thoroughly exposed how unjust and unreasonable the fifteen-nation proposal stubbornly adhered to by the United States is. The US representative uses Article 60 of the armistice agreement as an excuse to defend its unjust position. However, not a single sentence or word can be found in the article to refuse the Soviet Union's participation. The Soviet Union has made consistent efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, the Soviet Union is a neighbor of Korea, and it has an absolute influence on world peace and security. At the same time, there is no provision in the article that refuses India's participation. India has made considerable efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and has great concern for peace in the Far East. The commentary pointed out that this claim has not only been refuted by representatives of some countries, but also not supported by representatives of some countries participating in the fifteen-nation proposal."

The commentary said: "We, the entire Korean people, together with the Chinese people, warmly welcome the statement by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Nam Il fully supporting the Soviet proposal. Our attitude is clear: we support the Soviet proposal and oppose the US proposal."

The commentary emphasized: "The discussion process of the United Nations General Assembly so far shows that the United States not only has no sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue and easing international tensions, but is frantically creating obstacles in this regard. The United States put forward the fifteen-nation proposal, which shows their attempt to turn the political conference into a repeat of the Panmunjom negotiations in order to sabotage peace in Korea."

The Korean people will never allow the US imperialist warmongers' conspiracy to turn the political conference into a barrier for their renewed aggression and expansion of war to succeed.

"Democratic Korea" also published an editorial on the same day, pointing out: "People all over the world are paying attention to issues related to the political conference aimed at peacefully resolving the Korean issue. However, the US side stubbornly adheres to its unjust interpretation of Article 60, Paragraph 4 of the armistice agreement on important issues such as the form and composition of the political conference. Because the US side knows that one of the issues to be discussed at the political conference is the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, it signed the so-called ROK-US "Mutual Defense Treaty," which stipulates that the US Army, Navy, and Air Force have the right to be stationed in South Korean territory, and at the same time, it created the so-called "Sixteen-Nation Declaration." This shows that the US side is not working to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and ease international tensions, but is still playing with fire for the purpose of war."

The editorial said: "According to the essence of Article 60, Korea's neighbors, especially countries that have a direct stake in the Korean issue, should be included in the membership of the political conference. Representatives of other countries concerned with the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue must also participate. The conference should take the form of a 'round table conference' in order to ensure the greatest achievement of the conference. Therefore, Foreign Minister Nam Il supported Vyshinsky's proposal in his statement, emphasizing that the political conference must take the form of a round-table conference, and advocated that the issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the issue of peaceful resolution of the Korean issue should be discussed first, and then other issues should be discussed."

This is another manifestation of our firm stance in safeguarding the interests of all peace-loving people and peace and international security. If the US side truly wishes to peacefully resolve the Korean issue not just in words, then it must accept our legitimate claims.

"Korean People's Army Daily" also published an editorial, supporting the Soviet proposal and the statements of the Korean and Chinese governments. The editorial said: "All the Korean people, together with peace-loving people all over the world, resolutely demand that the political conference to be held become a conference for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. We are determined to fight to the end for this."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 27th: On the 26th, Pyongyang newspapers published on the front page the statement by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on the issue of the political conference.

### 朝鲜舆论主张政治会议必须成为和平解决朝鲜问题的会议  支持苏联提案和中朝政府声明

    朝鲜舆论主张政治会议必须成为和平解决朝鲜问题的会议
    支持苏联提案和中朝政府声明
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜舆论界一致支持关于政治会议问题的苏联提案和中朝两国政府的声明，主张政治会议必须成为和平解决朝鲜问题的会议。
    朝鲜中央通讯社二十七日以“朝鲜人民坚决支持关于政治会议问题的苏联提案”为题发表社论说：我们朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民一起，注视着联合国大会关于政治会议的组成问题的讨论。朝鲜人民之所以对此关心，是因为政治会议将要讨论从朝鲜境内撤退一切外国军队的问题与和平解决朝鲜问题的问题。全世界人民之所以对此关心，是因为朝鲜问题能否和平解决，对维护和巩固远东与世界和平有着密切的关系。
    评论指出：现在，在联合国政治委员会内有两条完全相反的路线。一条是苏联的和平政策的路线；另一条是美国的战争政策的路线。苏联主张政治会议要采取“圆桌会议”的形式，由交战双方和关心和平解决朝鲜问题的国家参加；而美国却在固执着政治会议只由交战双方参加的意见。苏联并提议，政治会议的任何决定必须获得朝鲜停战双方一致的同意才能通过。谁都知道，苏联的主张是最为正当而合理的；相反地，联合国政治委员会的讨论过程已彻底暴露了美国所固执的十五国提案是如此的不正当与不合理。美国代表以停战协定第六十款作为藉口，来为其不正当的立场辩护。但是，条款中找不到一句话或一个字可以用来拒绝苏联参加，苏联为了和平解决朝鲜问题曾作了一贯的努力，苏联是朝鲜的邻邦，而且对世界和平与安全有着绝对的影响力量。同时，在条款上也找不到任何拒绝印度参加的规定，印度对和平解决朝鲜问题作了不少的努力，并对远东和平怀着巨大的关心。评论指出，这种主张不但受到若干国家代表们的驳斥，而且连参加提出十五国提案的若干国家代表也不予支持。
    评论说：我们全朝鲜人民和中国人民一起，热烈地欢迎周恩来外交部长和南日外务相的完全支持苏联提案的声明。我们的态度是明确的，我们支持苏联的提议，反对美国的提案。
    评论强调指出：联合国大会到现在为止的讨论过程表明：美国不但没有一点和平解决朝鲜问题与缓和国际紧张局势的诚意，反而在这方面疯狂地制造着障碍。美国提出十五国提案，说明他们图谋把政治会议变成板门店谈判的再版，以破坏朝鲜的和平。
    朝鲜人民决不容许美帝国主义战争贩子企图把政治会议变为其再次进行侵略和扩大战争的屏障的阴谋得逞。
    “民主朝鲜报”同一天也发表社论指出：全世界人民注视着与旨在和平解决朝鲜问题的政治会议有关的问题。但是，美方在解决政治会议的形式和组成等重要问题上却固执着他们对停战协定第四条六十款的不正当的解释。美方因为知道在政治会议上要讨论的问题之一是一切外国军队从朝鲜撤出的问题，所以它签订了规定美国陆、海、空军有权驻在南朝鲜领土上的所谓韩美“共同防御条约”，同时又制造了所谓“十六国宣言”。这表明美方并不是为了和平解决朝鲜问题与缓和国际紧张状态而努力，而是仍然在为战争的目的而玩火。
    社论说：按照六十款的本质，朝鲜的邻邦，特别是对朝鲜问题有直接利害关系的各国，应当包括在政治会议的成员中。关心和平解决朝鲜问题的其他各国的代表也必须参加。会议应该采取“圆桌会议”的形式，以便保证会议的最大成就。因此，南日外务相在声明中支持了维辛斯基的提案，强调政治会议必须采取圆桌会议的形式，并主张首先讨论一切外国军队从朝鲜撤出的问题与和平解决朝鲜问题的问题，然后再讨论其他问题。
    这就是我方维护全体爱好和平人民的利益以及和平与国际安全的坚定立场的又一次表现。如果美方不是在口头上而是真正愿望和平解决朝鲜问题，那末就必须接受我们的正当主张。
    “朝鲜人民军报”也发表社论，支持苏联的提案和朝中两国政府的声明。社论说：全朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民一起，坚决要求使行将召开的政治会议成为和平解决朝鲜问题的会议。我们并决心为此而斗争到底。
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】二十六日，平壤各报在一版上刊载中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日关于政治会议问题的声明。
