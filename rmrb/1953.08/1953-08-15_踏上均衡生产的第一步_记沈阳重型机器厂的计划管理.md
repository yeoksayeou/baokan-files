Taking the First Step Towards Balanced Production
—A Record of the Planning Management at Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant
Lu Chaoqi

Editor's Note: The production characteristics of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant are complex varieties, diverse specifications, and small quantities of each product, resulting in frequent changes in production plans. In such factories, there are many difficulties in preparing operation plans and organizing balanced production. However, they have delved deeply into the production situation and brought their creativity into full play, and have finally initially explored some methods of how to prepare operation plans. Their experience is introduced below for research and reference by various factories and mines.

Shattering Two Fixed Views

The production characteristics of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant are: diverse varieties, many specifications, small quantities, fast changes, and urgent needs. This brings many difficulties to the implementation of planned management. This year, they are producing a total of twenty-five kinds of products, some weighing four hundred kilograms, and some weighing as much as one hundred and thirty tons; some can manufacture two hundred pieces a day, and some take ninety days to manufacture; each machine tool is responsible for a variety of processing parts, which makes it difficult to determine machine tool tasks when preparing operation plans. Secondly, the quantity required for each product is small, and some products are only manufactured once, and the tasks change quickly, which makes the factory often in a state of trial production of new products. And every time a product changes, raw materials, drawings, tools, fixtures, etc. have to be changed. As a result, pre-production preparation work is not easy to do well, and the technical level of workers is not easy to improve, which increases the difficulty of implementing the operation plan. Finally, due to the variety of product changes, it is also difficult to organize work sections and groups according to product type. Therefore, people have always had two relatively fixed views on this type of factory: products are mixed and not fixed, and planned management cannot be implemented; products change frequently, and joint work sections cannot be organized. The conclusion is: in this kind of factory, serious unbalanced phenomena in production are inevitable.

Now, these two views have been completely overturned by the fact that Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant has initially successfully implemented planned management.

Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant began to strengthen planned management from June this year by preparing and implementing operation plans for machining. The steps of the work started with mechanical assembly, then determining the production cycle of mechanical processing, and then determining the production cycle of forgings and castings, so that the upper and lower parts are connected. This approach is the same as other mechanical factories. The difference is that they have taken measures that are suitable for their own production characteristics.

Turning Complexity into Simplicity

As mentioned above, the variety of products and specifications makes it more difficult to prepare and implement operation plans. Therefore, in order to facilitate the preparation and implementation of operation plans, it is first necessary to simplify the complex product types and specifications in the process of organizing production. To this end, Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant adopted two methods. One is to put products into production in batches according to the order deadline and production cycle, changing the habit of not calculating carefully and doing whatever they want. With this new approach, there were only twelve types of products in mechanical processing in July, which is much simpler compared to the total of twenty-five products.

The second is to organize large joint work sections, small joint work sections, and standard parts joint work sections according to the size and type of equipment. This is the main method. The original work sections, except for a joint work section that specializes in making 300-horsepower air compressors and 20-horsepower coarse crushers, were all divided according to equipment types, that is, the "machine group work section" as generally said. This form of work section organization is not convenient for preparing and implementing operation plans. Because each work section is responsible for processing parts of various sizes and specifications, it is impossible to prepare a correct operation plan when products are mixed and changes are frequent. At the same time, because each work section is only responsible for one process in the entire part processing process, the head of the work section does not have the independent authority to be responsible for in the implementation of the operation plan, and often does not consider the difficulties of the next process (work section). This can easily lead to the disconnection of upper and lower processes and extend the turnover period of parts. According to the statistics from June 1st to 20th, the turnover period of parts was on average twenty times greater than the actual processing time, and the largest was more than eighty times! In this case, even if there is an operation plan, how can its implementation be guaranteed?

Now Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant organizes large work sections, small work sections and standard parts work sections in the mechanical processing workshop according to the size and type of equipment, puts large parts of various products in large work sections for processing, small parts in small work sections for processing, and standard parts in standard work sections for processing. This form of work section organization not only adapts to the characteristics of frequent product changes, but also prevents part processing from crossing work sections. The number of processing parts that each work section is responsible for is smaller, and the specifications are much simpler, so it is much easier to prepare the work section's operation plan. Since the part processing is completed in one work section, the head of the work section is responsible for each process, and the upper and lower processes can be connected. This creates conditions for strengthening process management and facilitates the realization of the plan.

Operation Plans Should Suit the Characteristics of Complex and Changeable Products

The variety of products determines that each machine tool is responsible for processing a wide variety of objects. Frequent product changes bring many difficulties to the supply of raw materials (castings and forgings), drawings, tools, and fixtures. Sometimes, when preparing workshop and work section operation plans, the supply of castings and forgings, drawings, tools, fixtures, etc. does not yet have specific dates. Based on these two characteristics, Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant pays attention to the following when preparing weekly (ten-day) operation plans for machining:

1. Classify all the parts of various products that need to be processed according to their size and different specifications, and determine the work sections and machine tools responsible for processing. Specifically determine the production operation line of a part from turning to planing... the entire processing process. In this way, we can ensure the connection of upper and lower processes, so that the parts flow according to the machine tools specified in the plan without confusion, thereby facilitating the control of the process and shortening the turnover period of the parts. Then, according to the number of parts required per product unit, calculate the equipment capacity load to see whether the man-hours required for the task are balanced with the actual effective machine hours. When calculating, like other factories, it is necessary to consider equipment maintenance, labor allocation, number of shifts, average advanced quota, etc. Then adjust the equipment load according to the needs of the task. When the capacity is surplus, temporary tasks can be added, or the number of shifts can be reduced; when it is insufficient, the number of shifts can be increased, or other machine tools can be used to replace it.

2. Because each machine tool is responsible for processing a wide variety of objects within a week (ten days), after the parts are assigned to the machine and the equipment load is balanced, it is necessary to further determine the production sequence of each machine tool according to the supply plan of castings and forgings, drawings, tools, and fixtures, and according to the assembly procedures, that is, to stipulate what to process first and what to process later. This can avoid some workers doing the easy work first and the difficult work later, and ensure the connection between processing and assembly.

However, because the supply of castings and forgings does not have a definite specific time when the weekly (ten-day) operation plan is prepared (this is mainly due to the multiple changes in products and the hasty preparation time), and the work-in-progress cannot be grasped for a while, the weekly (ten-day) operation plan can only stipulate the order of processing the parts and their production operation line. As for the connection between the processes, there is no specific time specified. It cannot yet become a specific action program for the daily activities of each machine tool and each worker. Therefore, the planners must also prepare a daily operation plan for the machine tool every day based on the material tickets (representing castings and forgings) sent by the production section and the engineering tickets (representing work-in-progress) transferred from the previous process, as well as the machine tool task allocation plan. This plan must be issued to the workers the day before processing, so that the workers can prepare for production work early, reduce non-production time, and thus improve production efficiency.

Everyone is Happy

In addition, Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant has gradually established and improved organizational structures around the preparation and implementation of operation plans, especially the organizational structures of grassroots units. Factory Director Wen Yuhe calls this work a century-old plan for production construction. What has been done and is being done now is to strengthen the leadership of the work sections and establish the management organization of the work sections. In the past, there were only one or two work section leaders in the work section. Planners, dispatchers, technicians, and even recorders were concentrated in the workshop. These people all work during the day. Night shift workers could not find the foreman if something happened; if there was a production problem, they could not find a technician, and no one was in charge of dispatching and recording. Therefore, not only was the productivity lower than that of the day shift, but also the labor discipline was looser. Now, each work section in the first workshop (machining and assembly workshop) is equipped with a general work section leader, three duty foremen, and is equipped with technicians, planners, and duty dispatchers and recorders. In addition, a pre-production preparation system and a on-site service system have also been established in the work section. The purpose of this system is to reduce the non-production time of workers. Ensure that workers spend all eight hours on production, thereby improving production efficiency.

The first workshop of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant started to prepare operation plans according to the machine tool load on a daily basis from July 2nd, while the organization of joint work sections according to the size of the machine tool only started on July 16th, which is only four or five days away from the time I went to Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant. This is only the first step towards balanced production, and it is still far from the ultimate goal of planned management. However, according to my conversations with work section leaders, workshop directors, planners, dispatchers, etc., they are all happy with this approach. The planner said that after having the operation plan, the contact with the dispatcher and the work section leader has become closer, and he has gradually grasped the actual production situation. The recorder believes that after having the operation plan, he has to fill in the actual situation every day, and his sense of responsibility has been strengthened. At the same time, he can understand the tasks of the workers the next day in advance, the work is more convenient, and there is no need to ask temporarily when recording, and he feels that this is the best. The dispatcher believes that with the operation plan, the inspection of plan execution and dispatching tasks have a pattern, unlike before when he blindly followed the assembly workers. The workers believe that they can know the production tasks one day in advance, and can prepare the tools and fixtures in advance, unlike in the past when they did whatever came, making them busy and causing some unnecessary interruptions in working hours. The workshop director said that because the work section leader, planning, dispatching and other management personnel have their own responsibilities, his work is much lighter, unlike before when he was asked about everything, but he could not do everything well. He is also clearer about the production situation. For example, through the implementation of the operation plan, he knows the factors that often destroy the realization of the operation plan. These factors belonging to the outside of the workshop are: the machining allowance of forgings and castings is too large (such as a part of a 400 kg air hammer, according to the material specifications, only a 15 糎 thick machining allowance is left, but 30 糎 is left), making the actual working hours exceed the planned working hours; the material tickets sent by the production section (indicating what materials are available) are inaccurate, and there are often many "bad checks" - the workers find that there are no materials in the semi-finished product warehouse when they go to collect the materials; the equipment power cannot complete the maintenance tasks according to the plan, and sometimes the quality is not good; the inspection section is not responsible enough for inspecting the quality, and some forgings and castings that the inspection section believes are qualified are found to be unqualified during processing, wasting processing time. The main internal factor in the workshop is loose labor discipline. For example, on July 10, only three of the six machine tools in one group were turned on.

These problems also show that it is right to focus on the processing and assembly workshop to carry out the operation plan, but it cannot be isolated. It is necessary to promote other workshops and departments to improve their work through the preparation and implementation of the operation plan. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant is working hard in this direction.

    踏上均衡生产的第一步
    ——记沈阳重型机器厂的计划管理
    陆超祺
    编者按：沈阳重型机器厂的生产特点，是品种复杂、规格繁多、每种产品的数量很少，因而生产计划经常变动。在这样的工厂里，编制作业计划、组织均衡生产是有很多困难的。但是他们深入钻研生产情况，发挥创造精神，终于初步摸索到如何编制作业计划的一些方法。现将他们的经验介绍如下，供各厂矿研究参考。
    击破两种固定的见解
    沈阳重型机器厂的生产特点是：品种杂，规格多，数量少，变得快，要得急。这给实行计划管理带来很多困难。他们今年一共要生产二十五种产品，有的重四百公斤，有的重至一百三十吨；有的一天可以制造两百个，有的一个要制造九十天；每一种机床所担负的加工部件很杂，编作业计划确定机床任务时便很困难。其次，每种产品要的数量少，有些产品只制造一台，任务变得快，使工厂经常处于试造新产品的状态。而每变一次产品，原材料、图纸、工具、卡具等都得变换。结果生产前准备工作不容易做好，工人的技术水平也不易提高，这都给贯彻作业计划增加了困难。最后，由于产品变化多，按产品类型组织工段、小组也困难。因此，人们对这一类的工厂，历来就有两种比较固定的见解：产品又杂又不固定，不能实行计划管理；产品经常变化，不能组织联合工段。其结论便是：在这种工厂里，生产上严重的不均衡现象是不可避免的。
    现在，这两种见解已被沈阳重型机器厂初步实行计划管理成功的事实彻底推翻了。
    沈阳重型机器厂从今年六月份起，开始通过编制与贯彻机械加工的作业计划来加强计划管理。工作的步骤是从机械装配开始，然后确定机械加工的生产周期，再确定锻件和铸件的生产周期，使上下衔接。这种做法和其他机械厂是一样的。所不同的是他们采取了适合自己生产特点的措施。
    把复杂化为简单
    上面已经说过，品种杂、规格多，使编制与贯彻作业计划增加很多困难。因此，为了便于编制与贯彻作业计划，首先必须把复杂的产品种类和规格，在组织生产的过程中使其简单化。为此，沈阳重型机器厂采用了两个办法。一是根据订货期限和生产周期，把产品分期投入生产，改变了不仔细计算，想做什么就做什么的习惯。采用了这种新的做法，七月份机械加工的产品只有十二种，与全部产品二十五种相比，已经简单的多了。
    二是按设备大小类型，组织大型联合工段，小型联合工段，标准件联合工段。这是主要的办法。原来的工段，除了有一个专门做三百匹马力空气压缩机和二十匹马力粗碎机的联合工段外，都是按设备种类划分的，即一般人所说的“机群式的工段”。这种工段组织形式对编制与贯彻作业计划都不方便。因为每一个工段所担负的加工部件，大小规格都有，在产品又杂变化又多的情况下，要编制正确的作业计划是不可能的。同时，又由于每一个工段在整个部件加工过程中只担负一个工序，工段长在执行作业计划中便没有独立负责的职权，往往不大考虑下一道工序（工段）的困难。这便很容易造成上下工序脱节，延长部件的周转期。根据六月一日至二十日的统计，部件的周转期平均比实际加工时间大二十倍，最大的竟达八十倍以上！在这种情况下，即使有了作业计划，又将怎样保证它的实现呢？
    现在沈阳重型机器厂在机械加工车间按设备大小类型，组织大型工段，小型工段和标准件工段，把各种产品的大部件放在大型工段加工，小部件放在小型工段加工，标准件放在标准工段加工。这种工段组织形式，既适应产品经常变化的特点，又使部件加工不跨工段。每一个工段所负担的加工部件，数量少了，规格简单多了，因而编制工段的作业计划就容易得多。由于部件加工在一个工段里完成，工段长便对各个工序负责，上下工序便能衔接。这便给加强工序管理创造了条件，便于计划的实现。
    作业计划要适合产品复杂多变的特点
    产品杂，就决定了每台机床所担负的加工物是多种多样的。产品经常变，便给原材料（铸锻件）、图纸、工具、卡具的供应带来许多困难。有时候，在编制车间、工段作业计划时，铸锻件、图纸、工具、卡具等的供应还没有具体的日期。根据这两个特点，沈阳重型机器厂编制机械加工的工段周（旬）作业计划时，就注意：
    一、把全部需要加工的各种产品的部件，按大小及不同的规格加以分类，确定负责加工的工段和机床。把一个部件从车到刨……整个加工过程，都具体确定其生产作业线。这样，才能保证上下工序衔接，使部件按计划指定的机床流转而不致于混乱，从而便于对工序的掌握，缩短部件的周转期。然后，按产品单位需要的部件数量，核算设备能力负荷，看看任务所需要的工时与实际机床的有效台时是否平衡。在核算时，像别的工厂一样，要考虑设备的检修，劳动力的配备，开动班次，平均先进定额等等。然后按任务需要，调整设备负荷。能力盈余时，可以增加临时任务，或减少班次；不足时可以增加班次，或者利用其他机床来代替。
    二、因为每台机床在周（旬）内所负担的加工物是多种多样的，所以在部件定机以及平衡设备负荷以后，还必须根据铸锻件、图纸、工具、卡具的供应计划，根据装配的程序，进一步确定每台机床的生产顺序，即规定其先加工什么，后加工什么。这才能避免部分工人先做好干的活，后做不好干的活，保证加工与装配衔接。
    但是，由于铸锻件的供应在编周（旬）作业计划时，还没有肯定的具体时间（这主要是因产品多变，准备时间匆促之故），以及对在制品一时还掌握不住，周（旬）作业计划只能规定部件先后加工顺序及其生产作业线，至于工序之间的衔接是没有具体时间规定的。它还不能成为每一台机床、每一个工人每日活动的具体行动纲领。因此，计划员还必须逐日根据生产科发来的材料票（代表铸锻件）和上一道工序转来的工程票（代表在制品），以及机床任务分配计划来编机床逐日作业计划。这种计划必须在加工前一天发给工人，以便工人提早做生产准备工作，减少非生产时间，从而提高生产效率。
    皆大喜欢
    此外，沈阳重型机器厂围绕着编制与贯彻作业计划，还逐步建立与健全了组织机构，特别是基层单位的组织机构。温玉和厂长把这个工作叫做生产建设的百年大计。现在已经做的和正在做的，是加强了工段的领导，建立了工段的管理组织。过去，工段里只有一个或两个工段长。计划员、调度员、技术员，甚至记录员都集中在车间里。这些人都是在白天上班的。夜班工人有事找不到工长；生产出了问题找不到技术员，调度、记录也没有人管。因此，不仅是生产率比白班的低些，就是劳动纪律也松懈些。现在，在一车间（机械加工装配车间）的每一个工段里，都配备了一个总工段长，三个值班工长，配备了技术员，计划员，和值班调度员、记录员。此外，还在工段里建立了生产前准备工作制和工地服务制。这种制度的目的在于减少工人的非生产时间。保证工人把八小时都用在生产上，从而提高生产效率。
    沈阳重型机器厂一车间实行逐日按机床负荷编制作业计划，是从七月二日开始的，而根据机床大小组织联合工段，则从七月十六日才开始，距我去沈阳重型机器厂的时间不过四、五天。这只是迈上均衡生产的第一步，距离计划管理的最终目标还远得很。但是，根据我和工段长，车间主任、计划员、调度员等人的谈话来看，他们对这样做法，是皆大喜欢的。计划员说，有了作业计划后，与调度员、工段长的联系密切了，逐渐掌握了实际生产情况。记录员认为有了作业计划后，每日得填写实际情况，责任心加强了。同时，事先能了解工人次日的任务，工作较方便，记录时不用临时问了，觉得这样顶好。调度员认为有了作业计划，检查计划执行与调度任务都有了谱，不像以前那样盲目跟装配工人跑了。工人们认为能提前一天知道生产任务，可以提前做好工卡具的准备工作，不像过去那样随来随干，弄得手忙脚乱，造成一些不必要的中断工时了。车间主任说，由于工段长、计划、调度等管理人员各有职责，他的工作轻得多了，不像以前那样，事事都找他，而他事事都做不好。对于生产的情况也比较清楚了。譬如说，通过作业计划的贯彻，知道经常破坏作业计划实现的因素了。这些因素属于车间外部的有：锻、铸件加工留量太大（如四百公斤空气锤有一个部件，按材料规格，只留十五糎厚的加工量，却留了三十糎），使实动工时超过计划工时；生产科发来的料票（表示有什么材料）不准确，往往有许多“空头支票”——工人去领料时才发现半成品库里没有料；设备动力不能按计划完成检修任务，有时候质量不好；检查科检查质量不够负责，有些锻铸件检查科认为合格的，但在加工中却发现不合格，浪费加工时间。属于车间内部的，主要是劳动纪律松懈。如在七月十日那一天，有一个小组的六台机床只开了三台。
    这些问题，也说明了以加工装配车间为重点搞作业计划是对的，但不能把它孤立起来，必须通过编制与贯彻作业计划，推动别的车间及科室改进工作。沈阳重型机器厂正在朝这方面努力。
