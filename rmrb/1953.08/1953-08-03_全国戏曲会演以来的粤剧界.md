	The Cantonese opera is the most popular major opera genre in South China. Like all brother opera genres, Cantonese opera has excellent artistic traditions and beautiful local characteristics. This is the basic reason why Cantonese opera can be passed down and loved by the vast audience. However, in the old society, the feudal rulers tried their best to use Cantonese opera to promote feudal ethics and morality, cultivate people's servility, and distort the history and appearance of the working people in order to consolidate the feudal social system. Especially in recent decades, due to the serious influence of imperialism, Cantonese opera has embarked on the wrong path of commercialization and colonialization from content to form. This has gradually made Cantonese opera lack popularity and become a tool for spreading comprador ideology and feudal ideology; it no longer has a realistic spirit and has fallen into the quagmire of formalism. Even in the three years since liberation, what occupied the Cantonese opera stage were still those tortuous, bizarre, feudal, erotic, boring, and low-taste contents that catered to the petty bourgeoisie. The content of almost all historical dramas was far-fetched and seriously violated the historical point of view. The flood of formalism, such as celluloid costumes, mechanical sets, and the six-pillar system (each play must have six main actors and make each person's roles equal), which drowned the true Cantonese opera art, continued to spread. The Cantonese opera "San Chun审父" (San Chun审父), a play that maintains feudal ethics and morality, was selected to participate in the first opera observation and performance in the Central and Southern region, which centrally illustrates the backward status of Cantonese opera at this time and the problems existing in the reform of Cantonese opera.

	The first National Opera Observation and Performance Conference brought Cantonese opera and Cantonese opera reform work to a new stage. As an old Cantonese opera artist said at the symposium welcoming the delegation: Cantonese opera is in a dangerous situation of "being near a deep pool in the middle of the night," and was shouted at loudly. After the northward performance, conveying the report, learning and discussion, Cantonese opera artists and opera work cadres initially recognized and criticized the poison of imperialist thought to Cantonese opera, and determined to turn back from the wrong path of commercialization and colonialization. During this period, after the observation and performance of old Cantonese opera artists and the performance of the Central and Southern delegation in Guangzhou, they initially attached importance to the excellent artistic traditions and beautiful local characteristics of Cantonese opera, and recognized the importance of sorting out Cantonese opera heritage.

	It was on this ideological basis that some new atmospheres appeared on the Cantonese opera stage. During this period, the Tai Yang Sheng Cantonese Opera Troupe performed "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai"; the Guangdong Provincial Rural Cantonese Opera Team performed "Li Xin Yu" and "Wooden Husband," which reflected the land reform struggle in Guangdong. In February of this year, the Cantonese opera troupes responded to the call of the Cantonese opera award-winning artists and the Academic Committee to "perform good plays during the Spring Festival" and performed "Luohan Qian," "The Tale of the White Snake," "Broken Bridge," "Liu Yin Ji," "Wooden Husband," and other relatively excellent plays. These plays, whether adapted from excellent plays of brother opera genres or written by themselves, showed a seriousness in the selection and performance of the plays, and also showed some new creations, especially the removal of those chaotic things such as slapstick, making gimmicks, celluloid costumes, and mechanical sets on the Cantonese opera stage in the past. Some of the plays were performed dozens of times, and are still loved by the audience today.

	However, these achievements cannot be considered to have fundamentally and firmly changed the status quo of Cantonese opera and solved the main problems in the reform of Cantonese opera. Our opera work cadres and the vast number of artists have only initially recognized the direction of opera reform and the direction of efforts, and there are many specific and fundamental issues that need to be further resolved.

	The script is the key to opera reform. The "Instructions on Opera Reform Work" issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government on May 5, 1951, clearly stipulates: "Opera should take the promotion of the people's new patriotism and the encouragement of the people's heroism in revolutionary struggles and productive labor as the primary task. Any opera that promotes resistance to aggression, resistance to oppression, love of the motherland, love of freedom, love of labor, and praise of the people's justice and their good character should be encouraged and promoted. On the contrary, any opera that promotes feudal slave morality, promotes barbaric terror or obscene and poisonous behavior, and uglifies and insults the working people should be opposed." The instruction emphasized when talking about reviewing old plays: "We must eliminate ideological content that has important poisons." The script is the foundation of theatrical activities. The responsibility of the leading organs and opera workers lies in leading opera playwrights to observe and judge historical events and figures from the viewpoint of the working class; to create and express new life and new characters in a realistic rather than idealistic, bloody and fleshy rather than formulaic manner using socialist realism. However, the cadres who lead the reform of Cantonese opera have not been clear enough about the issue of the ideological content of the script, which is first of all the script.

	Zeng Yansiu, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China South China Branch, in his report on "The Reform of Cantonese Opera" at the Guangdong and Guangzhou Municipal Delegation to the National Performance Conference, pointed out that Cantonese opera was seriously affected by imperialism, and the evil consequences produced in content. It also focused on criticizing the "expression form" of Cantonese opera, pointing out that the mechanical sets, celluloid costumes, six pillars, and four hours (the performance time of each play must be four hours) on the Cantonese opera stage should be gradually eliminated. This report played a certain role in the learning movement of all Cantonese opera artists at that time, because the basic spirit of this report is to require that the steps of Cantonese opera reform must start from the easiest to start and the scope most affected by the artists, which is in line with the steps stipulated in the State Council's "Instructions on Opera Reform Work". However, many Cantonese opera work cadres and artists did not understand this spirit in this way, and unilaterally believed that this was the "four elements" of Cantonese opera reform, that is to say, if they did not engage in "mechanical sets," did not wear "celluloid costumes," were not "six pillars," and did not perform for "four hours," then this Cantonese opera was a reformed new Cantonese opera, as for the ideological content of the script, it became secondary.

	Facts have proved that the main enemies of Cantonese opera reform are colonialization and commercialization tendencies. This tendency is manifested in the ideological content of Cantonese opera scripts, as well as in costumes, sets, the six-pillar system, performance time... and other aspects. The two are interrelated and mutually influential. We must not mechanically separate content and form, or simply regard the serious influence of imperialism as a matter of performance form only. From the current situation of Cantonese opera reform work, the script problem is more serious and more urgent to be solved.

	To solve the Cantonese opera script problem, first, we should organize forces to start sorting out the old Cantonese opera scripts. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently more than 1,700 Cantonese opera scripts, but many troupes have no plays to perform. Most of these more than 1,700 scripts are adapted from pornographic, boring, and low-taste movies, or pieced together. It is said that more than 30 repertoires have been initially determined for preservation. The effort to sort out this part of the script is not great. The leaders of the provincial and municipal cultural departments should immediately organize Cantonese opera artists and new literary and art workers to concentrate their efforts to sort out this part of the script first, and carry out the review of more than 1,700 scripts in a guided and planned manner, and gradually sort out and adapt the scripts that are still usable and basically usable. To carry out this work, we must cooperate with the vast number of artists. After the performance, transmission, and participation in learning, the consciousness of the artists has been initially improved, and many actors have asked to perform good scripts. This is a favorable condition.

	Second, continue to adapt the excellent scripts of brother opera genres. After participating in the Central and Southern Region and the National Performance Conference, a lot of this work has been done. Facts have proved that the performances of the adapted "Luohan Qian," "The Tale of the White Snake," "Liu Yin Ji," and the recently adapted "Selling Strange Fish and Turtles Mountain Causes Trouble" (i.e., Qinqiang "Traveling Turtles Mountain") by the Guangzhou Cantonese Opera Work Troupe have all been warmly welcomed by the audience. Because the adaptation of these scripts basically adheres to the spirit, plot, and characters of the original work, and can use the artistic form of Cantonese opera to a certain extent, they have become more satisfactory performances in recent times.

	Third, we must actively prepare conditions to create scripts that express new characters and new life. Today, many Cantonese opera playwrights are almost ignorant or know very little about the life, struggle, language, and especially the thoughts and feelings of the people, and they have not yet improved to the point where they can correctly use the class viewpoint to deal with characters and life. Literary and art leading organs should give them more necessary help, so that they have the opportunity to go deep into life and deep into the masses, and gradually improve their political and artistic level, so that they dare to create and can create.

	It should be pointed out that some new literary and art workers and new music workers in Guangdong still have the wrong idea of ​​despising local opera art, and some are indifferent because they are not very familiar with it, which prevents them from joining the Cantonese opera reform movement. However, without the participation and help of new literary and art workers and new music workers, it would be impossible to create a new Cantonese opera art on the basis of the artistic tradition of Cantonese opera.

	In addition, the artists of the Guangdong Rural Cantonese Opera Team have been performing in rural areas for a long time, and in the practice of serving the peasants, they experience life and boldly try to use the Cantonese opera form to reflect the real life of the people with collective strength. They have created and performed many new Cantonese operas that express the struggle of peasants to turn over and the thoughts and feelings of peasants, such as the scripts "Li Xin Yu" and "Wooden Husband" created and performed by the Sixth Team and the Tenth Team. Although there are different degrees of shortcomings, this fact fully illustrates the possibility of leading and organizing Cantonese opera artists to create and perform new Cantonese operas that express real life, and demonstrates the potential power of Cantonese opera script creation. We must actively prepare the necessary conditions and organize and lead these creative forces in a planned manner.

    全国戏曲会演以来的粤剧界
    邝君侠
    粤剧是华南地区最有群众基础的主要剧种。和各兄弟剧种一样，粤剧也具有优良的艺术传统和美丽的地方色彩。这是粤剧之所以能流传并为广大观众所热爱的基本原因。但是在旧社会里，封建统治者曾竭力利用粤剧来宣传封建伦理道德，培养人民的奴性，歪曲劳动人民的历史和面貌，以巩固封建社会制度。特别是近几十年来，由于帝国主义的严重影响，使粤剧从内容到形式都走上了商业化、殖民地化的错误道路。这样就使粤剧逐渐缺乏人民性，而变成传播买办思想、封建思想的工具；不再具有现实主义的精神，而陷入形式主义的泥坑。即在解放以来的三年中，占领粤剧舞台的还是那些曲折离奇、封建色情、无聊噱头、低级趣味的迎合小市民层的内容，几乎所有历史剧的内容都是牵强附会，严重地违反历史主义观点的。淹没了真正粤剧艺术的胶片服装、机关布景、六台柱制（每出戏都要配足六个主要演员，并使各人的戏份相等）等形式主义的洪流继续泛滥。粤剧“三春审父”这样一个维护封建伦理道德的戏，被选参加中南区第一届戏曲观摩会演，集中地说明了这一时期粤剧的落后现状和粤剧改革工作中存在的问题。
    全国第一届戏曲观摩演出大会将粤剧和粤剧改革工作推上了一个新的阶段。正如一位粤剧老艺人在欢迎代表团的座谈会上所说：粤剧正处于“夜半临深池”的危险境地，被大喝了一声。经过了北上会演、传达报告、学习讨论以后，粤剧艺人和戏曲工作干部，初步认识了和批判了帝国主义思想给予粤剧的毒害，决心从商业化、殖民地化的错误道路上走回头。这期间又经过了粤剧老艺人的观摩演出和中南代表团来广州的演出，初步重视粤剧的优良艺术传统和美丽的地方色彩，并认识整理粤剧遗产的重要性。
    就是在这一思想基础上，粤剧舞台上出现了一些新的气象。这期间，太阳升粤剧团演出了“梁山伯祝英台”；广东省农村粤剧队演出了反映广东土地改革斗争的“李新玉”和“木头夫婿”等剧目。今年二月，各粤剧团响应了粤剧获奖艺人和学委会“春节演好戏”的号召，演出了“罗汉钱”、“白蛇传”、“断桥”、“柳荫记”、“木头夫婿”等比较优秀的剧目。这些剧目，不管是从兄弟剧种的优秀剧目改编过来的，还是自己编写的，都表现了对剧目的选择和演出的严肃性，也表现了一些新的创造，特别是清除了过去粤剧舞台上的那些打科插诨、制造噱头、胶片服装、机关布景等乱七八糟的东西。有些剧目演出了好几十场，直到现在还为观众所喜爱。
    但是，这些成绩不能被认为已经根本地、巩固地改变了粤剧的现状和解决了粤剧改革工作中的主要问题。我们的戏曲工作干部和广大艺人，仅仅初步地认识了戏剧改革的方针和努力的方向，有很多具体的、带根本性质的问题，还待进一步地解决的。
    剧本是戏曲改革的关键。中央人民政府政务院一九五一年五月五日发出的“关于戏曲改革工作的指示”明确规定：“戏曲应以发扬人民新的爱国主义精神，鼓舞人民在革命斗争与生产劳动中的英雄主义为首要任务。凡宣传反抗侵略、反抗压迫、爱祖国、爱自由、爱劳动、表扬人民正义及其善良性格的戏曲应予以鼓励和推广，反之，凡鼓吹封建奴隶道德，鼓吹野蛮恐怖或猥亵淫毒行为、丑化与侮辱劳动人民的戏曲应加以反对。”指示在谈到审定旧有剧目的时候，又着重指出：“必须革除有重要毒害的思想内容”。剧本是戏剧活动的基础。领导机关和戏曲工作者的责任，就在于领导戏曲剧作者以工人阶级的观点来观察和判断历史事件和人物；以社会主义现实主义的方法来真实地而不是空想地、有血有肉地而不是公式概念地创造和表现新的生活和新的人物。然而，对这样一个首先是剧本，也就是剧本的思想内容的问题，领导粤剧改革工作的干部一直是不够明确的。
    中共中央华南分局宣传部曾彦修副部长在广东省、广州市参加全国会演代表团传达报告大会上所作的“关于粤剧改革问题”的报告，指出粤剧受到帝国主义的严重影响，在内容上所产生的恶果，也着重批判了粤剧的“表现形式”，指出粤剧舞台上的机关布景、胶片服装、六条台柱和四个钟头（每剧的演出时间一定要拉足四个钟头）等都应该逐步加以肃清。这个报告对当时全体粤剧艺人的学习运动是起了一定的作用的，因为这个报告的基本精神，是要求粤剧改革的步骤，必须从最容易着手和在艺人中最受影响的范围开始，这是符合政务院“关于戏曲改革工作的指示”所规定的步骤的。但很多粤剧工作干部和艺人没有这样来领会这个精神，片面地认为这就是粤剧改革的“四要素”，即是说，如果不搞“机关布景”，不穿“胶片服装”，不是“六条台柱”和不演“四个钟头”，那么，这个粤剧就是改革了的新的粤剧，至于剧本的思想内容的问题，就成为次要的了。
    事实证明，粤剧改革的主要敌人是殖民地化、商业化倾向。这个倾向，表现在粤剧剧本的思想内容上，也表现在服装、布景、六柱制、演出时间……等方面。这两者是互相关连、互为影响的。决不能机械地把内容和形式割裂开来，或仅仅把帝国主义的严重影响，只看成是一个表演形式问题。而从目前的粤剧改革工作的情况看，剧本问题是更严重、更急迫需要解决的。
    要解决粤剧剧本问题，第一，应该组织力量，着手整理粤剧的旧剧目。据不完全统计，目前粤剧共有一千七百多个剧目，但是很多剧团却无戏可演。这一千七百多个剧本中，大多数是根据色情、无聊、低级趣味的电影改编的，或者是七拼八凑写成的。据说已曾初步确定三十多个保留剧目。这一部分剧本的整理功夫不大，省、市文化部门的领导方面，应该立即组织粤剧艺人和新文艺工作者集中力量首先整理这一部分剧本，并有领导、有计划地进行对一千七百多个剧本的审查，把其中尚有可取的、基本可用的剧本逐步整理、改编出来。进行这个工作，必须和广大艺人合作，经过会演传达和参加学习以后，艺人的觉悟初步提高，不少演员要求演好的剧本，这是一个有利的条件。
    第二，继续改编兄弟剧种的优秀剧目。参加中南区和全国会演后，这个工作做了不少。事实证明，经过了改编的“罗汉钱”、“白蛇传”、“柳荫记”和最近广州粤剧工作团改编的“卖怪鱼龟山起祸”（即秦腔“游龟山”）等剧本的演出，都受到观众的热烈欢迎。由于这些剧本的改编工作，基本上忠实于原作的精神、情节和人物，又能在一定程度上运用了粤剧的艺术形式，因此成为最近时期比较令人满意的演出。
    第三，必须积极准备条件，创作表现新人物新生活的剧本。今天，许多粤剧编剧者对于人民群众的生活、斗争、语言，特别是人民群众的思想感情，几乎是无知的或知道得很少的，他们还没有提高到能正确地运用阶级观点来处理人物和生活。文艺领导机关，应该更多地给他们以必要的帮助，使他们有机会深入生活、深入群众，逐步地提高他们的政治水平和艺术水平，使他们敢于创作、能够创作。
    应该提出的，在广东一部分新文艺工作者和新音乐工作者中，还存在着轻视地方戏曲艺术的错误思想，有的则由于不很熟悉而漠不关心，这就妨碍他们投身到粤剧改革运动中去。但是，假如没有新文艺工作者和新音乐工作者的参加和帮助，要在粤剧艺术传统的基础上创造新的粤剧艺术，那是不可能的。
    此外，广东农村粤剧队的艺人们，长期深入农村演剧，并在为农民服务的实践过程中体验生活，用集体的力量大胆尝试用粤剧形式来反映人民的现实生活，他们曾创作和演出了不少表现农民翻身斗争和农民的思想感情的新粤剧，像第六队和第十队创作和演出的“李新玉”、“木头夫婿”等剧本，虽然还存在程度不同的缺点，但这一个事实，却充分说明领导和组织粤剧艺人创作和演出表现现实生活的新粤剧的可能性，说明粤剧剧本创作上的潜在力量。我们必须积极地去准备必要的条件，并有计划地去组织这个和领导这些创作力量。
