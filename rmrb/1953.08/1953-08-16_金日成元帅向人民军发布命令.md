Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 15th: Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, issued an order on the 15th to all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army to celebrate the eighth anniversary of the liberation of Korea.

    The order recounts the great contributions of the great Soviet army in liberating Korea from the long-term rule of Japanese imperialism, and the glorious achievements of the great Soviet people in selflessly assisting Korea during the period of peaceful construction. During the three years of the cruel war in which the entire Korean people rose up to resist the armed aggression of US imperialism, the Korean people and the heroic People's Army frequently received great assistance and support from the world democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union. With the military assistance of the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, they shattered the invaders' vicious plans.

    The order points out: The important task now facing the Korean People's Army is to vigilantly defend the peaceful and creative labor of the Korean people and actively help the working people restore the people's economy. The order requires: All officers and soldiers of the People's Army must cherish and master their weapons and combat equipment, and constantly improve their military and political knowledge. The officers and generals of the People's Army must study Soviet military science more deeply, summarize and study the rich experience of the Fatherland Liberation War, and continue to improve their command skills and the quality of their training work for their subordinates. All soldiers must continuously strengthen military discipline and establish solid order and organization within the troops. The order states: I am confident that the officers and soldiers of the People's Army, who have been further tempered in the Fatherland Liberation War, will surely gloriously accomplish the tasks before them.

    On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of "August 15th," the nationwide festival of the great Soviet army liberating our motherland, I hereby order: Today, August 15th, at 21:00 hours, in the temporary capital of the Republic, Pyongyang, and in Wonsan, Hamhung, and Nampo, 124 artillery pieces shall fire a 24-gun salute in unison.
