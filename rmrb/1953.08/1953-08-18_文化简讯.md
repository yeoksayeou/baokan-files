	National Railway Stations and Trains Strengthen Propaganda Work for Passengers
	Over the past three years, national railway stations and trains have made considerable achievements in cultural services and propaganda work for passengers. For example, during various political movements, they have publicized the policies and decrees of the People's Government, providing passengers with political education. In addition, cultural and recreational broadcast programs are often organized on trains. During festivals, celebration parties are held on trains to enliven the travel experience of passengers. Many stations and trains have also set up newsstand and magazine sales points, service cars, and book boxes to meet the needs of passengers.
	The national railway system has installed modern broadcasting equipment on 146 passenger trains and at 104 stations; over 500 full-time broadcasters and thousands of propagandists are responsible for propaganda work.
	The Propaganda Department of the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways and the Passenger Transport Department of the Ministry of Railways jointly convened a conference on cultural services and propaganda work at stations and trains at the end of July to further improve cultural services and propaganda work at stations and trains. The conference decided to strengthen leadership and carry out this work in a step-by-step and planned manner; gradually improve existing broadcasting equipment and add service cars or service desks on trains. It will also establish business contacts with local people's broadcasting stations to obtain guidance and assistance in business matters. In order to improve the political and professional level of propagandists and broadcasters, all propagandists and broadcasters will undergo training this year.

    全国铁路车站、列车加强对旅客的宣传工作
    三年多来，全国铁路车站、列车在对旅客的文化服务和宣传工作方面，有了不少成绩。例如在历次政治运动中，宣传了人民政府的政策和法令，使旅客们受到了政治教育；此外，并经常在列车上组织文化娱乐广播节目。每逢节日时，车上还举行庆祝晚会，活跃了旅客们的旅途生活。许多车站、列车上还设立了书报杂志代售处和服务车、书箱，以供给旅客们的需要。
    全国铁路已有一百四十六组客车和一百零四个车站设置了现代化的广播设备；有五百多名专职广播员和几千名宣传员负责宣传工作。
    中央人民政府铁道部政治部宣传部和铁道部的客运处，为进一步改进车站、列车上的文化服务和宣传工作，七月底联合召开了车站、列车文化服务和宣传工作会议，决定加强领导，有步骤有计划地开展这一工作；逐步改进现有广播设备，增设列车上的服务车或服务台。并和各地人民广播电台建立业务上的联系，以便在业务方面取得指导和帮助。又为了提高宣传员和广播员的政治、业务水平，本年内将对所有宣传员和广播员进行一次训练。
