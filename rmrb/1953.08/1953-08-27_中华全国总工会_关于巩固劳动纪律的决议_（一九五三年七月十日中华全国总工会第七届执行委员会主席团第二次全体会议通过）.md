All-China Federation of Trade Unions
Resolution on Consolidating Labor Discipline
(Adopted by the Second Plenary Meeting of the Presidium of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on July 10, 1953)
Our country has entered a period of planned economic construction. The task of realizing national industrialization and gradually transitioning to socialism has been placed before the people of the whole country. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: The victorious completion of this historical task "particularly relies on the Chinese working class to wage a more organized and more conscious struggle." Therefore, we must "oppose all phenomena that undermine labor discipline and greatly consolidate labor discipline." Without consolidated labor discipline, it is impossible for us to victoriously complete this great and arduous task. Because labor discipline is a necessary condition for organizing social labor and improving labor productivity. Feudal and capitalist societies also have their labor discipline, but that so-called labor discipline relies on clubs, whips, hunger, unemployment, and other means to force laborers to obey, which is an insult and devastation to laborers. In socialist societies and people's democratic countries led by the working class, labor discipline is maintained by the conscious spirit of the broad masses of workers and staff. The basis of this conscious labor discipline is the consistency of national interests and the personal interests of workers and staff.
After the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, won the revolutionary victory and became the ruling class, it began to establish a new production order with conscious labor. The labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and staff is increasing day by day, labor emulation is developing vigorously, and labor productivity is continuously improving. That is to say, the vast majority of workers and staff in our country are working loyally, diligently and bravely building our great motherland. This is a fact that must be affirmed first.
However, it must be pointed out that among a small number of workers and staff, there are still phenomena that violate and undermine labor discipline, such as absenteeism, taking leave on false pretenses, evading labor, passive怠工, disobeying commands and dispatch, and failing to comply with operating procedures and safety regulations. Although this phenomenon exists in a small number of people, its nature is serious and is opposed by the vast majority of workers and staff. The existence of this slack labor discipline is one of the important reasons for the failure to complete production plans, low product quality, many defective products, and frequent accidents. If left unchecked, it will inevitably disintegrate the organization and discipline of the working class, thereby seriously harming the great cause of the working class. At the same time, it will inevitably lead to the trade union work being divorced from the masses.
The reasons for the above-mentioned phenomena of undermining labor discipline are:
First, due to the influence of the bad habits left over from the old society, the awareness of a small number of workers and staff is not high enough. They have not yet truly realized the consistency of national interests and personal interests, and still treat the construction of the new society with the old labor attitude. At the same time, with the development of national industry, a large number of new workers and staff from peasants, urban poor, small handicraftsmen, and other classes have increased. These new workers and staff have more or less brought the bad habits of small producers, such as freedom, looseness, narrow selfishness. Because the working class itself still has these weaknesses, it is more vulnerable to the erosion of the bourgeoisie's lazy and decadent thinking. This is the social and historical root cause of the current slack labor discipline.
Second, in some factories and mining enterprises, the past corrupt management system that exploited and oppressed workers has been abolished during the democratic reform stage, but after the abolition of the old system, a new and sound management system has not been established and improved in time. The vast majority of factories do not have appropriate internal factory rules, lack a reasonable reward system, the wage system is still quite chaotic, and there are no certain measures to deal with those who undermine labor discipline.
Third, poor planning management, imbalanced production, a large number of crash work phenomena, and poor safety and health conditions have affected the consolidation of labor discipline.
Fourth, in capitalist enterprises, some unscrupulous capitalists have adopted despicable means of seduction against workers and staff, intentionally creating licentious behavior among a small number of workers and staff, corrupting the working class, and further fueling the slackening of labor discipline.
Although there are various reasons for the current slack labor discipline, it must be pointed out that the reason why it has not been prevented and overcome in time is that the political and ideological work in factories and mining enterprises is weak, and there is a bureaucratic style; some trade union and administrative cadres still have a tendency to accommodate backward tailism towards the phenomenon of slack labor discipline; some trade union cadres still have the remnants of the so-called erroneous thinking of "specific stand"; the trade union organization has not yet regarded consolidating labor discipline as its constant and major responsibility in state-owned enterprises to ensure the completion of national plans and in private enterprises to implement labor-capital mutual benefit; little or no education has been carried out on workers and staff, especially new workers and staff, to abide by labor discipline, and a system for consolidating labor discipline has not been established. The trade union has not been able to better play the role of "communist school." This has allowed non-working-class ideas and phenomena that undermine labor discipline to grow in the ranks of the working class. These should be mainly the responsibility of the leadership.
Experience in Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan and other places has proved that as long as the leadership pays attention and carries out appropriate education among the masses of workers and staff, this phenomenon of slack labor discipline can be reversed. Therefore, trade union organizations at all levels must regard consolidating labor discipline as their constant and major responsibility. According to the different situations of factories and mines, they should conduct specific analysis, find out the root causes of slack labor discipline, and combine the current central work to conduct a concentrated education on labor discipline among the masses of workers and staff for a certain period, which is very necessary. However, it must be pointed out that establishing conscious labor discipline is a long-term and regular task. At the same time, it must be pointed out that consolidating labor discipline is an internal issue of the working class. Therefore, conducting in-depth political and ideological education, especially communist education, to the masses of workers and staff has become the most fundamental way to consolidate labor discipline. In carrying out this education, it is necessary to commend the good and criticize the bad, so that workers can understand the consistency of national interests and personal interests from specific facts and their own experiences, understand the losses caused to the country by slack labor discipline, and understand that only by doing a good job in production can we realize national industrialization, gradually transition to socialist society, and have a better life. It is necessary to promote a new moral atmosphere of "labor is glorious, evading labor is shameful" among the masses. The trade union should improve the group life and launch criticism and self-criticism, so that consolidating labor discipline becomes the public opinion of the masses, in order to improve the organization and discipline of the working class. It is also entirely necessary to give appropriate punishment to those who seriously undermine labor discipline and refuse to mend their ways despite repeated education. But it must be pointed out that the purpose of punishing individual elements is to more effectively carry out education on consolidating labor discipline for the broad masses of workers and staff. Therefore, it is necessary to oppose adopting simple and crude methods and strictly prevent the tendency of punishment-ism. In private enterprises, it is especially necessary to oppose and expose any unscrupulous capitalists who, under the guise of consolidating labor discipline, unreasonably oppress workers.
The education on consolidating labor discipline should be mainly carried out through organizing labor emulation. Comrade Stalin taught us: "Use labor emulation to effectively combat those who are lazy and evade work and undermine labor discipline." Because the competition itself embodies the criticism and self-criticism of the masses. When the trade union organizes workers and staff to discuss the national production plan and formulate competition conditions, it should include compliance with labor discipline as one of the important contents. When checking and summarizing labor emulation, it is also necessary to check and summarize the situation of compliance with labor discipline.
The trade union organization has the responsibility to assist the administration and urge the capitalists to improve production management, implement the responsibility system, improve the wage system, establish a reasonable reward system, reduce the phenomenon of crash work, and strengthen the education of operating procedures and safety regulations. According to the principle of need and possibility, it is necessary to plan and practically improve working conditions, improve safety and health work, implement the safety production policy, pay attention to the rational distribution of workers and staff's spare time, reduce unnecessary meetings, correctly guide the social life of the masses of workers and staff, and carry out proper cultural and recreational activities, so that they can obtain the necessary rest and protect their health, which is of great significance for consolidating labor discipline.
The trade union organization also has the responsibility to assist the administration in drafting internal factory rules. Our experience in this area is still very insufficient. Therefore, the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has instructed the industrial unions, large administrative regions, and provincial and municipal trade union organizations to select key factories to conduct experiments and gain experience in order to promote them.
We firmly believe that the measures to consolidate labor discipline are supported by the broad masses of workers and staff; the vast majority of workers and staff who violate labor discipline can improve their awareness and consciously abide by labor discipline after being educated. At present, many factories and mining enterprises in various regions are carrying out education on consolidating labor discipline, and they have achieved remarkable results. Trade union organizations at all levels should, under the leadership of the Communist Party committees at all levels, steadily carry out patient persuasion and explanation work among the broad masses of workers and staff. As long as we do this, the current phenomenon of slack labor discipline of some workers and staff can be overcome. Workers, engineering and technical personnel, and staff throughout the country should consciously oppose all bad phenomena that undermine labor discipline and harm the cause of national construction, strive to improve their organization and discipline, consciously consolidate labor discipline, and strive to continuously improve labor productivity, improve product quality, reduce costs, carry out safe production, and ensure the completion and strive to overfulfill the various indicators of the national construction plan.

    中华全国总工会
    关于巩固劳动纪律的决议
    （一九五三年七月十日中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团第二次全体会议通过）
    我国已经进入了有计划的经济建设时期。实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义的任务，已经摆在全国人民的面前。正如刘少奇同志所指示的：要胜利地完成这个历史任务，“是特别有赖于中国工人阶级作更有组织和更高觉悟的斗争的”。因此，就必须“反对破坏劳动纪律的各种现象，大大地巩固劳动纪律”。如果没有巩固的劳动纪律，我们就不可能胜利地完成这一伟大而艰巨的任务。因为劳动纪律是组织社会劳动和提高劳动生产率的必要条件。封建社会与资本主义社会也都有它的劳动纪律，但是那种所谓劳动纪律是依靠棍棒、皮鞭、饥饿、失业等手段来强迫劳动者遵守的，是对劳动者的凌辱与摧残。在社会主义社会和工人阶级领导的人民民主国家中，劳动纪律则是依靠广大职工群众的自觉精神来维持的。这种自觉的劳动纪律的基础就是国家利益与职工个人利益的一致性。
    中国工人阶级在中国共产党的领导下取得革命胜利并成为执政的阶级之后，就开始以自觉的劳动建立了新的生产秩序。广大职工群众的劳动热情日益高涨，劳动竞赛蓬勃发展，劳动生产率不断提高。这就是说，我国绝大多数的职工群众都在忠诚地劳动着，勤劳而勇敢地建设着我们伟大的祖国。这是必须首先肯定的事实。
    但是，不能不指出：在一小部分职工中，仍然存在着旷工、借故请假、逃避劳动、消极怠工、不服从指挥调度、不遵守操作规程和保安规程等违反和破坏劳动纪律的现象。这种现象虽然是少数人的，但性质是严重的，而且是为绝大多数职工群众所反对的。这种劳动纪律松弛现象的存在是造成生产计划完不成、产品质量低、废品多、事故频繁的重要原因之一。如果听其自流，势必涣散工人阶级的组织性和纪律性，从而使工人阶级的伟大事业受到严重的危害，同时，也必然使工会工作脱离群众。
    产生上述破坏劳动纪律现象的原因：
    首先，是由于旧社会遗留的恶劣习气的影响，使一小部分职工的觉悟还不够高，他们还没有真正认识到国家利益与个人利益的一致性，仍然以旧的劳动态度来对待新社会的建设事业。同时，随着国家工业的发展，来自农民、城市贫民、小手工业者和其他阶层的新职工大量增加，这些新职工都或多或少地带来了小生产者的自由散漫、狭隘自私的不良习气。由于工人阶级本身目前还存在着这些弱点，就更容易受到资产阶级的怠惰腐化思想的侵蚀。这就是产生目前劳动纪律松弛现象的社会的历史的根源。
    第二，在某些厂矿企业中，过去的一套剥削压迫工人的腐败的管理制度，在民主改革阶段已经废除，但是在废除旧制度之后，还没有及时地建立与健全新的管理制度。绝大多数工厂还没有适当的工厂内部规则，还缺乏合理的奖励制度，工资制度还相当混乱，对破坏劳动纪律的分子还没有一定的处理办法。
    第三，计划管理不周，生产失去均衡，突击现象大量存在，安全卫生条件不好，从而影响了劳动纪律的巩固。
    第四，在资本主义企业中某些不法资本家对职工采取了卑鄙的引诱手段，有意造成少数职工的放荡行为，腐蚀工人阶级，更助长了劳动纪律的松弛。
    目前劳动纪律松弛的现象，虽有上述种种原因，但必须指出：其所以未能防止和及时克服，则是由于厂矿企业中政治思想工作薄弱，存在着官僚主义作风；某些工会和行政干部对劳动纪律松弛的现象，还有迁就落后的尾巴主义倾向；某些工会干部还有所谓“具体立场”的错误思想的残余；工会组织还没有把巩固劳动纪律作为自己在国营企业中保证完成国家计划、在私营企业中贯彻劳资两利的经常的重大责任；对职工特别是新职工，很少或没有进行过遵守劳动纪律的教育，没有建立起巩固劳动纪律的制度。工会还没有能够更好地发挥“共产主义学校”的作用。这就使非工人阶级的思想和破坏劳动纪律的现象，得以在工人阶级队伍中滋长起来。这些，主要地应由领导上来负责。
    北京、天津、武汉等地的经验证明，只要领导上予以注意，在职工群众中进行适当的教育，这种劳动纪律松弛的现象即可扭转。因此，工会各级组织必须把巩固劳动纪律作为自己经常的重大责任，根据厂矿的不同情况，进行具体的分析，找出劳动纪律松弛的根本原因，在一定期间结合当前的中心工作，集中地对职工群众进行一次劳动纪律的教育，是十分必要的。但是必须指出：建立自觉的劳动纪律是一个长时期的经常的任务。同时也必须指出：巩固劳动纪律是工人阶级内部的问题，因而，深入地向职工群众进行政治思想教育特别是共产主义教育，便成为巩固劳动纪律的最根本的办法。在进行这种教育时，要表扬好的，批评坏的，使工人从具体事实与自己的切身经验中懂得国家利益和个人利益的一致性，懂得劳动纪律松弛对国家造成的损失，懂得只有搞好生产才能实现国家工业化，才能逐步过渡到社会主义社会，才有更美好的生活。要在群众中发扬“劳动光荣，逃避劳动可耻”的新的道德风气。工会应当把小组生活健全起来，展开批评与自我批评，使巩固劳动纪律成为群众的舆论，以提高工人阶级的组织性和纪律性。对于严重破坏劳动纪律、屡教不改的分子，给予适当的处分，这也是完全必要的。但必须指出：处分个别分子的目的，是为了更有效地对于广大职工群众进行巩固劳动纪律的教育。因此，必须反对采取简单粗暴的方式，严格防止惩办主义的倾向。在私营企业中，尤其必须反对和揭发任何不明大义的资方，假借巩固劳动纪律而无理压迫工人的不法行为。
    巩固劳动纪律的教育，主要应通过组织劳动竞赛来进行。斯大林同志教导我们：“运用劳动竞赛，有效地反对偷懒逃工、破坏劳动纪律的分子。”因为竞赛本身就体现着群众的批评和自我批评。工会在组织职工群众讨论国家生产计划、制订竞赛条件时，应当把遵守劳动纪律作为重要内容之一。在检查和总结劳动竞赛时，同样应当检查和总结遵守劳动纪律的情况。
    工会组织有责任协助行政和督促资方，改进生产管理，贯彻责任制，改进工资制度，建立合理的奖励制度，减少突击现象，加强操作规程和保安规程的教育。根据需要与可能的原则，有计划地、切实地改善劳动条件，改进安全卫生工作，贯彻安全生产方针，注意合理地支配职工业余时间，减少不必要的会议，正确地指导职工群众的社会生活，开展正当的文化娱乐活动，使他们能获得必要的休息，保护他们的身体健康，这对于巩固劳动纪律是有重大作用的。
    工会组织也有责任协助行政拟订工厂内部规则。这方面我们的经验还很不够，因此中华全国总工会主席团责成各产业工会、大行政区、省、市工会组织，选择重点工厂进行试验，取得经验，以便推广。
    我们深信：巩固劳动纪律的措施，是为广大职工群众所拥护的；少数违反劳动纪律的职工，经过教育后，绝大部分是能够提高觉悟和自觉地遵守劳动纪律的。现在各地区许多厂矿企业正在进行巩固劳动纪律的教育，而且都获得了显著的成绩。工会各级组织都应在共产党的各级党委领导下，稳健地在广大职工群众中进行耐心的说服解释工作，只要我们这样做，目前部分职工劳动纪律松弛的现象是能够克服的。全国工人、工程技术人员、职员都应自觉地反对一切破坏劳动纪律、危害国家建设事业的不良现象，努力提高自己的组织性与纪律性，自觉地巩固劳动纪律，为不断地提高劳动生产率、提高产品质量、降低成本、进行安全生产、保证完成并力求超额完成国家建设计划的各项指标而奋斗。
