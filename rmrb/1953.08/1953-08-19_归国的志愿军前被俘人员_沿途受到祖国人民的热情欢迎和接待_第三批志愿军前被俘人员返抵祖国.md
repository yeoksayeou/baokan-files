Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 18th: The repatriated former prisoners of war of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were warmly welcomed and received by the people of the motherland along the way as they returned to the country.

On August 16th, a group of repatriated former prisoners of war of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered the territory of the motherland by special train from Korea. At each welcoming station along the way to a certain place in Northeast China, welcoming crowds offered hot tea and sponge cake to each returning person. Some Young Pioneers and students near the stations also performed Yangko dances and waist drum dances to express their sympathy.

At a little after 5 p.m. on the 16th, the returning personnel passed through Sujiatun Station, a suburb of Shenyang City, by train. As soon as the train entered the station, songs rang out on the platform. At this time, the returning personnel also waved the national flag and the military caps of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which they had preserved through struggle in the enemy prisoner-of-war camps. As the returning personnel accepted the biscuits, cakes, and hot tea sent by the masses, the Yangko team performed various songs and dances. The returning personnel also sang struggle songs composed in the enemy prisoner-of-war camps, such as "Resolutely Demand Repatriation." At this time, many white-haired old mothers walked to the front of each carriage to express their sympathy to the returning personnel. Old mother Geng Shiyu also exhorted the returning personnel, saying, "Rest well, quickly recover your bodies that have been tortured by the enemy, and participate well in the peaceful construction of the motherland in the future."

Xinhua News Agency, Andong, August 18th: The third group of 1,388 former prisoners of war of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning to the motherland arrived in Andong City on the night of the 17th and were immediately transferred to sanatorium areas for recuperation. They were warmly welcomed and received by the people of Andong City. (Attached picture)

    【新华社沈阳十八日电】被遣返的中国人民志愿军的被俘人员在返回祖国途中，受到沿途祖国人民热情的欢迎和接待。
    被遣返的一部分中国人民志愿军的被俘人员，在八月十六日从朝鲜乘专车进入祖国疆土。在通往东北某地的沿途各欢迎站上，欢迎群众把热茶和鸡蛋糕，送给每一位归来人员。有些车站附近的少年先锋队员和青年学生，还为归来人员表演了大秧歌和腰鼓，表示慰问。
    十六日晚五点多钟，归来人员乘车经过沈阳市郊区苏家屯车站，列车刚驶进车站，站台上歌声四起。这时，归来人员也挥起了在敌人战俘营中进行斗争保存下来的国旗和中国人民志愿军的军帽。当归来人员接受群众送来的饼干、蛋糕和热茶的时候，秧歌队表演了各种歌舞。归来人员也唱起了在敌人战俘营中编成的“坚决要求遣返”等斗争歌曲。这时，很多白发苍苍的老妈妈，走到每一个车厢前，向归来人员进行慰问。耿世玉老妈妈并嘱咐归来人员说：“好好休养，快些恢复被敌人折磨的身体，将来好好参加祖国的和平建设。”
    【新华社安东十八日电】第三批返回祖国的中国人民志愿军前被俘人员一千三百八十八人，于十七日夜抵达安东市，并即转往疗养地区休养。他们受到安东市人民热情的欢迎和接待。（附图片）
