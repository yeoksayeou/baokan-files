    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 18th: On the 18th, our side repatriated 150 non-Korean POWs and 300 Korean POWs to the other side, a total of 450. Among the non-Korean POWs, there were 75 American POWs and 75 British POWs.
    The other side repatriated 2,403 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side. After arriving at our side's exchange area, they all accused the US side of abusing and persecuting POWs. Kim Sun-juk, a captured member of our side with a disabled left arm, said that a captured member of the Korean People's Army named Park Pyung-won was burned to death by a US flamethrower tank. He himself was also shot in the left arm by US troops. Another captured member of our side, Hong Chun-sik, said: In the hot summer, the US POW camp authorities deliberately drove POWs, who were extremely weak due to suffering, to the scorching sun to be exposed to the sun until they fainted and vomited. Last summer, two sick captured members of the Korean People's Army were sunburnt to death in the square. Among the returning personnel of our side today, another one was scalded on the arm by Li bandit police with boiling water at Incheon Station.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 18th: In the thirteen days from August 5th to 17th, the Joint Red Cross team working at our side's POW exchange site received twenty-six accusations from captured Korean-Chinese personnel against the US side's abuse and persecution of POWs.
    Among the twenty-six accusations from our returning personnel, nineteen crimes occurred before and after the signing of the armistice agreement and during the repatriation of POWs. Among these nineteen crimes, the US side killed captured personnel of our side with gas bombs, and a total of 852 people were poisoned and fainted on the spot, and 71 were injured, including five who lost their sight. For example, at 23:30 on August 3rd, sixty captured members of the Korean People's Army from the 64th hospital of the US POW camp on Geoje Island left the POW camp by truck for repatriation. The truck they were riding in was equipped with a device for releasing gas bombs, and the US driver exploded the gas bombs with the push of a button. When our captured personnel sang and celebrated their return to the motherland on the way, the US military released three asphyxiating and vomiting gas bombs. More than twenty captured personnel of our side fainted on the spot, and six were injured. On August 13th, when 600 captured personnel of our side were on a ship from Bongam Island to Incheon, the US military threw six gas bombs into the cabin, and 589 captured personnel of our side were poisoned and fainted. On August 8th, the US side threw gas bombs at captured female personnel and children of our side in Busan, and seven captured female personnel of our side were poisoned and fainted.
    The returning personnel of our side also accused the US side of abusing and persecuting sick and wounded POWs. Shen Hongzhang, a captured member of the Chinese People's Volunteers, accused that in January 1952, thirty-five sick and wounded personnel of our side were sent to the First Hospital of the US POW camp for surgery, and eighteen of them were killed within two weeks. In addition, on July 28th this year, in the 13th POW camp of the US side on Geoje Island, US special agents put poison in the food of our captured personnel, plotting to poison our captured personnel.
    The representatives of both sides of the Joint Red Cross team interrogated the accusers one by one on the spot to clarify the above-mentioned facts of the US side's abuse and persecution of our captured personnel. The representative of the other side's Red Cross also expressed his willingness to convey the above facts to the United Nations Command authorities for prompt handling.

    朝中方面和对方八月十八日继续遣返战俘
    我方归来人员继续控诉美方迫害战俘的暴行
    【新华社开城十八日电】十八日，我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百五十名，朝鲜籍战俘三百名，共四百五十名，在非朝鲜籍战俘中有美国籍战俘和英国籍战俘各七十五名。
    对方遣送给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员二千四百零三名。他们到达我方交接区以后，都纷纷控诉美方虐待和迫害战俘的罪行。左臂残废的我方被俘人员金顺竹说，一个名叫朴平原的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，曾被美军喷火坦克烧死。他自己也曾被美军开枪打伤左臂。另一个我方被俘人员洪春植说：在炎热的夏季，美军战俘营当局故意把因饱受折磨而身体极为羸弱的战俘赶到烈日下曝晒，一直晒得他们昏迷呕吐。去年夏天就有两个患病的朝鲜人民军被俘人员被晒死在广场上。今天归来的我方被俘人员中，又有一名在仁川车站上被李匪警察用开水烫伤了臂膀。
    【新华社开城十八日电】从八月五日到十七日的十三天内，在我方战俘交接地点工作的联合红十字会小组，接受了二十六起朝中被俘人员对美方虐待和迫害战俘的控诉。
    在我方归来人员的二十六起控诉中，有十九起罪行是在停战协定签字前后及战俘遣返途中发生的，在这十九起罪行中，美方以毒气弹杀害我方被俘人员，共有八百五十二人当场中毒昏倒，七十一人受伤，其中有五人双目失明。例如，八月三日二十三时半，巨济岛美方战俘营第六十四号病院的六十名朝鲜人民军被俘人员乘卡车离战俘营遣返归来。在他们乘坐的一辆卡车上就装有放射毒气弹的设备，美军司机一按电钮，毒气弹就自行爆炸。当我方被俘人员在途中唱歌欢庆返回祖国时，美军就放射出三颗窒息性和呕吐性的毒气弹。二十多名我方被俘人员当场昏倒，六人受伤。八月十三日，六百名我方被俘人员乘轮船从蜂岩岛赴仁川途中，美军在船舱里投掷了六枚毒气弹，五百八十九名我方被俘人员中毒昏倒。八月八日，美方在釜山对我方女被俘人员和儿童投掷毒气弹，七名我方女被俘人员中毒昏倒。
    我方归来人员还控诉了美方虐待和迫害病伤战俘的罪行。中国人民志愿军被俘人员申洪彰控诉说，在一九五二年一月间，有三十五个我方病伤人员被送到美方战俘营第一医院开刀，两周内就被害死了十八名。另外，在今年七月二十八日，巨济岛美方第十三号战俘营内，美方特务在我方被俘人员的饭食内投放毒药，阴谋毒害我方被俘人员。
    上述美方虐待和迫害我方被俘人员的事实，联合红十字会小组双方红十字会代表都当场向控诉者一一查问清楚。对方红十字会代表并表示愿意将上述事实转达联合国军当局迅速加以处理。
