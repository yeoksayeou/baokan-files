    On Strengthening the Work of Translating Films into Minority Languages
    Editor's Note: On August 3rd, comrades Mamut, Halikejiang, Aziziang (Uygur) and Wu Liansheng (Xibe), staff members of the Beijing Film Studio, visited the reader mail group of this newspaper to report that the leaders of the studio did not pay enough attention to the printing and distribution of films translated into minority languages, with the result that most of the films they translated into Uyghur were not delivered to minority areas in Xinjiang for screening in a timely manner, greatly weakening the propaganda and educational role of these films. After this newspaper learned about the situation from the studio leaders, it was confirmed to be true. The factory has examined the reasons for this situation and taken effective measures to solve the problem. The opinions of the four comrades, Mamut et al., and the reply of the leaders of the Beijing Film Studio to this opinion are published together below:
    Opinions of the Four Comrades Including Mamut
    The four of us are working in the state-owned Beijing Film Studio to translate films of our motherland into Uyghur. From 1951 to May of this year, we have successively translated eight films: "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities", "Happy Xinjiang", "Resist America, Aid Korea", "Frontier Warriors", "National Day of 1951", "The People's Liberation Army Marches into Tibet", "Long Live Peace" and "Oppose Germ Warfare". Now, the first two films translated, "Great Unity of Chinese Nationalities" and "Happy Xinjiang", have been shipped to Xinjiang for screening. These two films were warmly welcomed by all ethnic groups in Xinjiang during the screening; they played a certain role in stimulating the patriotic enthusiasm of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, encouraging them to participate in the construction of the motherland, and educating them to strengthen the unity with all fraternal ethnic groups in the country. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are eagerly hoping to see more and more films of the motherland translated into their languages.
    However, the leaders of our factory do not pay enough attention to how to strive to meet the needs of the minority people for the film industry of the motherland. As mentioned earlier, we have translated eight films, but only two have been shipped to Xinjiang for screening; the other six have not been printed and distributed in time. Some of these films have been sent to the China Film Distribution Company, but the China Film Distribution Company has not distributed them in time, and the leaders of our factory have not paid attention to them; some are still piled up in our own warehouses; and some have not been printed in time. Most of these films are current affairs documentaries, and their propaganda and educational role will be weakened if the time is delayed for a long time.
    In order to strive for the timely printing and distribution of these films, we have repeatedly raised the above opinions to the factory director's office, requesting a quick solution to this problem; later, opinions were continuously raised at the factory's business meetings and on the blackboard newspapers. However, this problem has not been paid attention to by the leaders and has not been solved until now. We request the leaders of our factory to quickly use effective methods to solve the above-mentioned problem, so that the film industry of the motherland can better exert its propaganda and educational role and serve the minority people.
    Reply from the Beijing Film Studio
    Regarding the problem of delayed production time and failure to distribute minority language and local language translated films on time in our factory, relevant personnel have been convened to conduct an inspection, and the reasons are as follows:
    1.  The supply of duplicate picture negatives is not timely: All translated films need to be re-copied from the original picture to produce a set of negatives before copies for screening can be printed. This duplicate negative needs to be developed by an automatic film developing machine. However, our factory has few such machines, and they also need to be used for the washing of various films (duplicate negatives, soundtracks, distribution copies, etc.), so the production capacity often cannot keep up with the needs. In addition, the comrade in charge of the printing and washing department does not have a sufficient understanding of the important significance of producing translated films ideologically, and the work of copying the negatives of translated films, which should be done, is repeatedly postponed when scheduling the printing and washing production plan. This will not ensure that the translated films have duplicate completed negatives to print copies in a timely manner after the recording is completed. This delay was very serious in the first half of 1953. For example, the Uyghur version of "Oppose Germ Warfare" was recorded in March, but the first copy (only for review) was not printed until early July, a delay of more than three months; the Tibetan version of "Light Shines on Tibet" was recorded in April, but the first copy has only been printed now, a delay of more than four months.
    2.  Printing copies is not timely: After the film translation is completed and approved, according to the production system, the China Film Distribution Company must notify our factory to print distribution copies. However, the China Film Distribution Company often notifies us late, and we do not actively urge them enough, thus delaying the film distribution time. For example, the Uyghur version of "The People's Liberation Army Marches into Tibet" was approved in January, but the China Film Distribution Company did not notify us to print distribution copies until June, a delay of five months. Secondly, the accident and schedule delays in our washing and printing department have also repeatedly delayed the copy printing time of translated films. For example, the Uyghur version of "Frontier Warriors" was translated in December 1952 and has not yet been printed and distributed, a delay of eight months; the Uyghur version of "Resist America, Aid Korea" was translated in December 1952, and the distribution copies were not printed until June of this year, a delay of six months.
    3.  The review of translated films takes some time: After the minority language translated films of our factory are completed, we need to invite responsible comrades from relevant units to review them, and some films require a review time of one or two months.
    However, the main reason for the delayed production time of minority language translated films in our factory is that the leaders of our factory only arranged the production plan for the translated film work, but lacked inspection of the completion of the plan. This also reflects that our leaders do not pay enough attention to minority language and local language translated films, and have not yet realized the profound significance of translating news documentaries with great political significance and sending them to minority areas for screening in a timely manner, and educating all staff participating in this work with this idea.
    The above situation was revealed by comrades of our factory as early as July. The leaders of our factory immediately began to find ways to rush out all the required duplicate negatives. In the future, we will also ensure the timely supply of duplicate negatives. Copies of "Frontier Warriors", "Oppose Germ Warfare" and other films have all been printed and sent out. The printing system for distribution copies has also been modified with the consent of the China Film Distribution Company. In the future, after each translated film is approved, we can print distribution copies without waiting for notification from the China Film Distribution Company, so as to shorten the distribution time.

### 关于加强用少数民族语翻译影片工作的问题

    关于加强用少数民族语翻译影片工作的问题
    编者按：八月三日，北京电影制片厂工作人员马木提、哈力克江、阿孜子江（维吾尔族）和吴连升（锡伯族）四同志访问本报读者来信组，反映该厂领导方面不重视用少数民族语言翻译的影片的洗印和发行工作，以致他们用维吾尔族语译好了的影片，大部未能及时送到新疆少数民族地区去放映，大大削弱了这些影片的宣传与教育的作用。经本报向该厂领导方面了解，证明情况属实。该厂已经检查了发生这种情况的原因并采取有效措施解决这个问题。现将马木提等四位同志的意见和北京电影制片厂领导方面对这一意见的答复，一并发表如下：
    马木提等四同志的意见
    我们四个人都在国营北京电影制片厂做用维吾尔族语翻译祖国影片的工作。从一九五一年到今年五月，我们已经陆续译好了“中国民族大团结”，“欢乐的新疆”、“抗美援朝”、“边疆战士”、“一九五一年的国庆节”、“解放西藏大军行”、“和平万岁”和“反对细菌战”八部影片。现在最初译出的“中国民族大团结”和“欢乐的新疆”两部影片已经运到新疆去放映。这两部影片在新疆放映时，受到了新疆各族人民的热烈欢迎；对于激发新疆各族人民的爱国主义热情，鼓舞他们参加祖国建设事业的积极性，教育他们加强和国内各兄弟民族的团结等方面，都起了一定的作用。新疆各族人民都迫切希望能够看到愈来愈多的用他们的语言译制的祖国影片。
    但是，我厂领导方面对怎样努力满足少数民族人民对祖国电影事业的要求这个工作，是不够重视的。前面说过，我们已经译好了八部影片，只有两部运到新疆去放映；其它六部却都不能及时洗印与发行出去。这些影片有的虽然已经送到中国电影发行公司去了，但中国电影发行公司没有及时发行，我们厂的领导同志也不去过问；有的还积压在自己的仓库里；还有的没有及时洗印。这些影片大部分是时事纪录片，时间拖延久了就会削弱它们的宣传教育作用。
    为了争取这些影片的及时洗印和发行，我们曾经多次向厂长室提过以上的意见，要求赶快解决这个问题；后来在厂的业务会上、黑板报上也都不断提过意见。但是，这个问题一直没有得到领导同志的重视，拖到现在还没解决。我们要求我们厂的领导同志赶快用有效办法来解决上面所说的这个问题，使祖国的电影事业更好地发挥它的宣传教育作用，并且为少数民族人民服务。
    北京电影制片厂的答复
    关于我厂少数民族语及地方语译制片拖延制作时间、未能按时发行问题，已经召集有关人员进行检查，其原因如下：
    一，复制画面底片供应不及时：所有译制影片均需由原版画面再复制一套底片始能印制上映用的拷贝。此项复制底片须经自动洗片机显影。而我厂这种机器少，且需兼作各种影片（复制底片、声带、发行拷贝等）的冲洗工作，所以生产能力经常赶不上需要。加上洗印部门负责同志在思想上对生产译制片的重要意义认识不够，在排定洗印生产计划时往往把应该要做的译制片复制底片工作一再推延。这样就不能保证各译制影片在录音完毕后及时有复制完成的底片印制拷贝。这种拖延情况在一九五三年上半年度的生产中是很严重的。如“反对细菌战”维吾尔语版在三月间录音完毕，到七月初才印出第一个拷贝（只是供审查用的），拖延了三个多月；“光明照耀着西藏”藏语版在四月间录音完毕，至今才印出第一个拷贝，拖延了四个多月。
    二，印制拷贝不及时：影片译制完成并审查通过后，按照生产制度，须由中国电影发行公司通知我
    厂印制发行拷贝。但中国电影发行公司往往通知较晚，而我们主动督促又不够，因而拖延影片发行时间。如“解放西藏大军行”维语版在一月审查通过，中国电影发行公司至六月始通知我们印制发行拷贝，拖延五个月。其次，我们洗印部门因发生事故及计划推延，也使译制片拷贝印制时间一再延迟。如“边疆战士”维语版于一九五二年十二月译成，至今尚未印制发行拷贝，拖延了八个月；“抗美援朝”维语版于一九五二年十二月译成，至今年六月才印制完发行拷贝，拖延了六个月。
    三，译制片的审查需要一段时间：我厂少数民族语译制片完成后，均需约请有关单位负责同志审查，有些片子审查时间需要一两个月。
    但是，我厂少数民族语译制片拖延制作时间的主要原因还在于我们厂的领导方面对译制片工作只布置了生产计划，而缺乏对计划完成情况的检查。这也反映了我们领导方面对少数民族语及地方语译制片重视不够，还没有认识到将具有重大政治意义的新闻纪录影片译制后，及时送到少数民族地区上映的深刻意义，并以这种思想教育所有参加这一工作的工作人员。
    以上情况，早在七月间即为本厂同志所揭露。我厂领导方面当即开始设法将所需的复制底片全部赶出。今后也将保证复制底片的按时供应。“边疆战士”、“反对细菌战”等拷贝已全部印齐发出。发行拷贝的印制制度也取得中国电影发行公司同意作了修改，今后各译制片审查通过后，无须等待中国电影发行公司通知，我们就可以印制发行拷贝，以缩短发行时间。
