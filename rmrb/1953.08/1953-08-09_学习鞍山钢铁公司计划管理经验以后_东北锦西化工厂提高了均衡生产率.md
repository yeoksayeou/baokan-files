After learning from Anshan Iron and Steel Company's planning management experience, the Northeast Jinxi Chemical Plant improved its balanced production rate.

    After learning from Anshan Iron and Steel Company's planning management experience, the workers of the Northeast Jinxi Chemical Plant improved the balanced production rate.

    The Jinxi Chemical Plant began implementing production instruction charts in workshops as early as 1951. In February 1952, a dispatching organization was established within the Production Technology Section, initially overcoming blindness in production. However, due to insufficient understanding of the significance of balanced production among leaders and the masses at the time, the compilation of operation plans and production instruction charts lacked a reliable basis, and the dispatching system was not sound. As a result, production remained unbalanced, leading to significant waste and frequent accidents.

    In May of this year, some leading cadres of the plant participated in the study of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's planning management work. This study greatly enlightened the plant's leading cadres on how to improve the factory's planning and management. After returning to the plant, they conveyed Anshan Steel's planning management experience and organized all the plant's employees to study it. During the study, the broad masses of workers reviewed their past work in light of actual conditions and formulated an operational plan for July based on Anshan Steel's advanced experience.

    Through the study, the workers generally recognized the relationship between the planned nature of production in state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature and the entire national economy. They also recognized the importance of balanced production and planned production. At the same time, the study increased their professional knowledge. For example, some people in the supply and marketing departments said, "In the past, we only knew how to run around aimlessly, but now we know that supply work can also have operational plans." Therefore, after the study, they immediately proposed seven material supply instruction charts. Personnel in the technical inspection section who inspected raw materials established a contact system with the manager's section after the study. Based on the manager's section's material supply instructions, they established inspection instruction charts, and analytical work gradually became planned. In the past, workshop cadres generally did not pay attention to dispatching work, believing that the dispatching station was just making trouble. After the study, they established an overall concept and reviewed their past erroneous thinking.

    At the same time, the study brought into play the work enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of workers, especially the technical personnel. For example, in May, the biggest problem affecting balanced production was frequent electrical accidents. In order to ensure the balanced completion of the production plan, electrical technician Yuan Zhao'e and others studied the reports of Soviet experts, identified the cause of the accidents, and solved the problem of arcing short circuits in power transmission. They also strengthened the regular inspection of electrical equipment, thus eliminating the electrical accidents that often occurred in June due to untimely or poor maintenance. Due to the strengthening of planning management, the balance rate of production has been significantly improved. The plant's balance rate in May was 75.2 percent, and in June it reached 85.7 percent. In the bleaching powder workshop, which had better balanced production, the monthly balance rate in June reached 97.5 percent, basically overcoming the phenomenon of loose production in the beginning and tight production at the end that had existed in the past.

    学习鞍山钢铁公司计划管理经验以后
    东北锦西化工厂提高了均衡生产率
    东北锦西化工厂职工学习鞍山钢铁公司计划管理经验后，提高了均衡生产率。
    锦西化工厂早在一九五一年就开始在车间推行了生产指示图表，一九五二年二月在生产技术科内设立了调度机构，初步克服了生产中的盲目现象。但由于当时从领导干部到群众对均衡生产的意义认识不足，编制作业计划和生产指示图表缺乏可靠的依据，调度制度也不健全，生产仍然不均衡，浪费大，事故多。
    今年五月该厂部分领导干部参加了鞍山钢铁公司计划管理工作的学习，通过这次学习使该厂的领导干部对如何搞好工厂计划管理工作得到了很大的启发。他们回厂后，传达了鞍钢计划管理的经验，并组织了全厂职工进行了学习。在学习中，广大职工联系实际检查了过去的工作，还根据鞍钢的先进经验制订了七月份的作业计划。
    职工们通过学习，普遍认识了社会主义性质国营企业生产的计划性与整个国民经济的关系，认识了均衡生产和计划生产的重要意义。同时通过学习也增加了不少业务知识。如供销部门有的人说：“我们过去只知道乱跑，这回知道供应工作也可以订作业计划了。”于是在学习后，他们即提出了七种材料供应指示图表。技术检查科检查原料的人在学习后，与经理科建立了联系制度，根据经理科材料供应指示图，建立了检查指示图，分析工作也逐步走上了计划性。过去车间干部普遍不重视调度工作，认为调度站是找麻烦，经过学习后都树立了整体观念，检查了过去的错误思想。
    同时，通过学习，发挥了广大职工、特别是技术人员的工作积极性和主动性。如五月份影响均衡生产最大的问题是电气事故多，为了保证均衡地完成生产计划，电气技术员袁昭锷等学习了苏联专家报告，找出事故原因，解决了电力输送弧光短路的事故，并加强了电气设备定期检修，因而在六月份消灭了因检修不及时或检修不好而常常发生的电气事故。由于加强了计划管理，生产的均衡率有了很显著的提高。该厂五月份均衡率为百分之七十五点二，六月份均衡率即达到百分之八十五点七。均衡生产较好的漂白粉车间，六月份全月均衡率达到百分之九十七点五，基本上克服了过去生产上前松后紧的现象。
