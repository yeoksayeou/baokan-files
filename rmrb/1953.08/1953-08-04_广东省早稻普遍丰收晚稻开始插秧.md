Guangdong Province's rural production has shifted from summer harvesting to the intense summer planting season.

This year's summer harvest is the first after land reform in Guangdong Province. Except for a few areas that suffered severe natural disasters and experienced reduced production, most areas saw an increase of more than 10% in early rice compared to last year. For example, since the beginning of spring plowing, Yangjiang County mobilized the masses to repair 20,150 large and small water conservancy projects, enabling 140,000 mu of dry land that had been short of water for years to be irrigated, resulting in a bumper harvest. After the start of spring plowing in Zhongshan County, the production policy was vigorously promoted and implemented, stabilizing the production mood of all classes, organizing and mobilizing farmers to overcome the spring cold, and leading farmers to overcome floods in May and June. This year, the county's early rice production increased by 15%. Many villages in Xinhui County increased production by 20% to 30%. In the past, a large area of the Datou Polder in Shitou Township, this county, only yielded dozens of catties of rice per mu per year, but this summer harvest reached 450 catties of rice per mu. In Chao'an County, many districts and townships increased production by more than 20%, and Fengxi Township in the 13th District increased production by 99%.

In Hainan Island, except for Changgan, Dan County, and Dongfang counties in the north, which suffered poor harvests due to drought, Wanning, Ding'an, Lingshui, and Qiongdong counties all had bumper harvests. Eighty percent of the areas in Wanning County had bumper harvests, with a general increase of 20%. Veteran farmers in Tunchang County reflected that this year's summer harvest was the best in the three years since liberation. Ji Yayu, a farmer in Ledong County, a Li and Miao Autonomous Region, produced 258 catties of early rice per mu last year and 568 catties this year, more than doubling production.

At present, the province has basically completed the summer harvest work and entered the intense summer plowing and planting stage. In Hainan Island, where the production season is earlier, the summer planting work has basically ended. In some areas of western and eastern Guangdong, late rice has begun to be transplanted. Late rice seedlings in northern and central Guangdong have grown to four or five inches tall and will begin to be transplanted after the Great Heat. However, drought is prevalent in various places, and diseases and insect pests have also occurred one after another. In order to ensure the smooth progress of summer plowing and planting, local leading organs are actively leading farmers to prevent and fight drought, eliminate insects, and protect seedlings in order to strive for a bumper harvest of late rice.

    广东省早稻普遍丰收晚稻开始插秧
    广东省的农村生产已由夏收转入紧张的夏种阶段。
    今年的夏收是广东省土地改革后的第一个夏收。全省除少数地区因遭受严重的自然灾害而减产外，大部分地区早稻比去年一般增产一成以上。例如，阳江县在春耕以来，发动群众修好了大小水利工程二万零一百五十个，使历年缺水的十四万亩旱田得到灌溉，获得丰收。中山县春耕开始后，大力宣传贯彻了生产政策，稳定了各阶层生产情绪，组织发动农民战胜了春寒，五、六月间又领导农民战胜了水灾，今年全县早稻增产百分之十五。新会县不少乡村增产百分之二十至三十。该县石头乡大片围过去每亩一年收成只几十斤稻谷，今年夏收每亩达四百五十斤稻谷。潮安县不少区乡增产都在二成以上，十三区凤溪乡增产达百分之九十九。
    海南岛除北部昌感、儋县、东方等三县因旱歉收外，万宁、定安、陵水、琼东等县都是丰收。万宁县百分之八十地区获得丰收，一般增产百分之二十。屯昌县老农民反映：解放后三年来，今年夏收最好。黎族苗族自治区的乐东县农民吉亚郁，去年早稻每亩产二百五十八斤，今年产五百六十八斤，增产一倍多。
    现在全省已基本结束夏收工作，进入紧张的夏耕夏种阶段。生产季节较早的海南岛，夏种工作已基本结束。粤西、粤东的部分地区晚稻已开始插秧。粤北、粤中的晚稻秧苗已长到四、五寸高，大暑后就开始插秧。但目前各地普遍呈现旱象，病虫害也相继发生，为保证夏耕夏种工作的顺利进行，各地领导机关正积极领导农民防旱抗旱、除虫保苗，以争取晚稻的丰收。（本报广东记者站）
