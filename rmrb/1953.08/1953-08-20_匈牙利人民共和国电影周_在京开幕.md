Xinhua News Agency, August 19th: "Hungarian People's Republic Film Week" is about to begin on the 20th. Six excellent Hungarian films will be screened simultaneously in twenty major cities in our country. The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government solemnly held the opening ceremony of the film week at the Capital Cinema in Beijing on the evening of the 19th.

More than 1,200 people from the capital's film, drama, literature, art, and music circles attended the opening ceremony of the film week. Attendees included Ding Xilin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, and Chen Huangmei, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture. Guests included Czertordai, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Hungarian People's Republic Embassy in China, embassy officials, and diplomatic officials from various countries' embassies in China.

Ding Xilin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, delivered the opening speech, saying: I firmly believe that this Hungarian Film Week will be warmly welcomed by the broad masses of our people. This is because the consistency of the political ideals and struggle goals of our two countries has powerfully helped our people feel closely related and extraordinarily intimate with the Hungarian people in terms of thought and feeling. The characteristics of Hungarian films, in addition to lofty Party spirit, also include boldness and creativity, which are mainly reflected in the richness of thematic content and the diversity of subject matter. The six films screened during this film week all reflect the struggle events of great significance in the contemporary social and political life of Hungary. All this will give our people good encouragement. This film week will play a great role in further consolidating and developing the close unity and friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples, and in our common struggle to defend world peace.

Czertordai, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Hungarian People's Republic Embassy in China, was invited to speak. He said: Tomorrow is the fourth anniversary of the promulgation of the Hungarian Constitution. The Hungarian Film Week, which begins simultaneously in twenty major cities in China on this day, is a very important event in the friendly and cultural relations between our two peoples. Last year, the Chinese Film Festival held in Hungary greatly interested Hungarian audiences. They deeply sympathized with the suffering of the Chinese people in the past; when they saw the happy life of liberated China on the screen, they rejoiced with their Chinese brothers. "Steel Fighter" and "The White Haired Girl" received extremely high praise. In early October this year, Hungary will hold another film festival to introduce the latest works of Chinese film art. We know that the Chinese people are also deeply concerned about the construction and development of Hungary. We are very pleased that the screening of Hungarian films can further promote the friendly ties between the two peoples.

Afterwards, those who attended the opening ceremony watched the Hungarian film "Underground Colony." This film is based on the true events of the exposure of the US imperialist secret agents lurking in the Hungarian oil company in 1948 and the arduous struggle of the Hungarian working class to restore oil production. It won a special honorary award at the 6th International Film Festival. It was unanimously praised by everyone.

    “匈牙利人民共和国电影周”在京开幕
    【新华社十九日讯】“匈牙利人民共和国电影周”即将在二十日开始。六部优秀匈牙利影片将同时在我国二十个大城市放映。中央人民政府文化部特于十九日晚在北京首都电影院隆重举行电影周开幕典礼。
    首都电影、戏剧、文学、美术、音乐界人士共一千二百多人参加了电影周开幕典礼。参加的人有中央人民政府文化部副部长丁西林，文化部电影局副局长陈荒煤。来宾有匈牙利人民共和国驻我国大使馆临时代办察托尔道伊和大使馆官员，以及各国驻我国使馆外交官员。
    中央人民政府文化部副部长丁西林致开幕词说：我深信这次匈牙利电影周，一定会受到我国广大人民的热烈欢迎。这是因为我们两个国家的政治理想和斗争目标的一致性，有力地帮助了我国人民在思想和感情上对于匈牙利人民都感到休戚相关而分外亲切。匈牙利电影的特点，除崇高的党性外，还有大胆而富于创造性，这主要地表现在主题内容的丰富与题裁的多样性。这次电影周放映的六部影片所反映的，都是匈牙利当代社会政治生活中具有重要意义的斗争事件。这一切会给我国人民以很好的鼓舞。这次电影周对于进一步巩固和发展中匈两国人民的亲密团结与友好合作，对于我们为保卫世界和平而作的共同奋斗，都是有很大作用的。
    匈牙利人民共和国驻我国大使馆临时代办察托尔道伊应邀讲话。他说：明天是匈牙利宪法颁布第四周年纪念日，这一天在中国二十个大城市同时开始的匈牙利电影周，是我们两国人民友好和文化关系上一个很重要的事件。去年，匈牙利举办的中国电影节，使匈牙利观众感到极大的兴趣。对中国人民过去所受的痛苦，他们深深地同情；当他们在银幕上看见解放了的中国的幸福生活的时候，他们又和中国兄弟们一同欢欣鼓舞。“钢铁战士”和“白毛女”曾获得极高的评价。今年十月初，匈牙利又将举行一次电影节，介绍中国电影艺术最新的作品。我们知道，中国人民也深切关怀匈牙利的建设和发展。由于放映匈牙利电影，能更进一步促进两国人民之间的友谊联系，我们觉得非常高兴。
    接着，参加开幕典礼的人观看了匈牙利影片“地下殖民地”。这部影片是根据一九四八年美帝国主义潜伏在匈牙利石油公司里的特务阴谋破坏油田被揭发，以及匈牙利工人阶级为恢复石油生产所作艰巨斗争的真实事件摄制的，曾获得第六届国际电影节特别荣誉奖。它得到大家一致的赞赏。
