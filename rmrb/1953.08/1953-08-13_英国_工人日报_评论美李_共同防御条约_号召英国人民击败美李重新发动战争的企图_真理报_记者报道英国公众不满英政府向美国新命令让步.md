Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 12th: London’s "Daily Worker" published an editorial on August 11th commenting on the joint statement issued by Dulles and Syngman Rhee after their talks, and the signing of the "Mutual Defense Treaty." The editorial said: "Now that Dulles has scheduled a timetable for Syngman Rhee to re-launch the Korean War, the British people must act first." The editorial said: "The Dulles-Syngman Rhee joint statement clearly shows that the United States and the South Korean fascist dictator have reached an agreement on a common course of action at the political conference. They say they advocate a unified Korea. The only unified Korea acceptable to the United States is a Korea ruled by Syngman Rhee, so in fact they are demanding the surrender of North Korea. They want to get at the conference what they could not get on the battlefield."

The editorial went on to say: They unanimously stated that if the political conference does not give them what they hope to get within ninety days, they will withdraw from the conference together; after the agreed-upon conference time limit, Syngman Rhee is free to re-launch the war. The editorial continued: "The ink on the armistice agreement is not yet dry, and this vicious timetable for re-launching aggression in Korea has been signed and sealed." The editorial pointed out: "This agreement should be a danger signal to every peace-loving person. The very fact that Dulles and Syngman Rhee signed the so-called mutual defense treaty shows that the United States does not want peace and does not intend to withdraw from Korea."

The editorial concluded: "Now is the time for the British people to take action. They have the power to defeat this heinous plot and turn the armistice into a lasting peace."

Xinhua News Agency, August 12th: According to TASS, Moscow, August 11th: "Pravda" correspondent in London, V. Mayevsky, reported that a few days ago, the British capital learned that the United States and the other fifteen countries participating in the war against the Korean people (including the United Kingdom) signed a declaration on the Korean armistice on July 27th. The release of this news coincided with the signing of a new military treaty between US Secretary of State Dulles and the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. According to this treaty, US armed forces will remain in South Korea indefinitely, which means that the treaty legitimizes the US action of turning South Korea into its colony.

This step by the United States cannot but attract great attention from the British public. In commenting on the US-ROK treaty, the conservative British "Observer" said that the British Foreign Office hastily issued a vague statement, apparently to appease the startled public. However, this statement cannot calm the British people, who are already disturbed by the government's assumption of huge obligations regarding the resumption of military operations immediately after the armistice was achieved.

Referring to the background of the sixteen-nation declaration, Mayevsky quoted a comment from the New York correspondent of the British "Daily Mirror," who said that the United States had to exert great pressure because public opinion in various countries was firmly opposed to the resumption of the Korean War, and official representatives of the participating countries could not ignore this fact. These officials secretly yielded to the new orders of the United States behind the backs of their people. It is very intriguing that the news of the signing of the declaration was not announced until ten days later.

It was pointed out in London that the news about the sixteen-nation declaration was not released before the adjournment of Parliament, apparently to prevent another "explosion" from occurring in Parliament and elsewhere.

Mayevsky concluded that broad sections of the British people are demanding that their government take a stand that is in line with the national interests of the United Kingdom. Facts show that the British public will increasingly strongly resist any attempt by the enemies of peace to undermine the Korean armistice and rekindle the flames of war in the Far East.

    英国“工人日报”评论美李“共同防御条约”
    号召英国人民击败美李重新发动战争的企图
    “真理报”记者报道英国公众不满英政府向美国新命令让步
    【新华社柏林十二日电】伦敦“工人日报”十一日发表社论，评论杜勒斯和李承晚举行会谈后发表的联合声明和签订的“共同防御条约”。社论说：“现在杜勒斯已排定让李承晚重新发动朝鲜战争的时间表，英国人民必须首先行动起来。”社论说：“杜勒斯李承晚联合声明清楚地表明，美国和南朝鲜法西斯独裁者已就在政治会议上采取一致行动的方针取得协议。他们说，他们主张实现一个统一的朝鲜。唯一能为美国接受的统一的朝鲜是李承晚统治的朝鲜，因此实际上他们是要求北朝鲜屈服。他们想在会议上取得他们在战场上得不到的东西。”
    社论接着说：他们一致表示，如果政治会议在九十天以内不能使他们得到他们希望得到的东西，他们将一同退出会议；在一致同意的会议时限以后，李承晚可以自由重新发动战争。社论接着说：“在停战协定上的墨迹还没有全干的时候，这个准备在朝鲜重新发动侵略的恶毒的时间表就签名盖印了。”社论指出：“这种协议对每一个爱好和平的人都应当是一个危险的信号。杜勒斯和李承晚签订所谓共同防御条约这一事实本身表明，美国不要和平，它不打算从朝鲜撤退。”
    社论最后说：“现在是英国人民采取行动的时候了。他们有力量击败这种穷凶极恶的图谋，使停战变成持久的和平。” 【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：“真理报”驻伦敦记者维·马耶夫斯基报道说，几天前，英国首都获悉美国和参加对朝鲜人民作战的其他十五个国家（包括英国在内）于七月二十七日在关于朝鲜停战的一篇宣言上签了字。这个消息发表的时候，正好碰上美国国务卿杜勒斯与李承晚傀儡政权商订的新军事条约也签了字。根据这个条约，美国武装部队将无限期地留在南朝鲜，这就是说，这个条约使美国把南朝鲜变成它的殖民地的行动合法化。
    美国的这个步骤不能不引起英国公众的极大注意。英国保守的“观察家报”在评论美李条约时说，英国外交部匆匆发表了一篇含糊的声明，显然是为了安慰吃惊的公众。但是，这篇声明不能使英国人平静下来，他们已因政府在停战刚一实现时马上又承担了关于恢复军事行动的巨大义务而感到惶惶不安。
    马耶夫斯基谈到十六国宣言的背景时，引用了英国“每日镜报”驻纽约记者的评论，这位记者说，美国不得不施用很大的压力，因为各国的舆论都坚决反对恢复朝鲜战争，参战国家的官方代表不能不顾到这个事实。这些官员们背着他们的人民，偷偷向美国的新命令让了步。宣言签字的消息过了十天才公布是十分耐人寻味的事情。
    伦敦有人指出，关于十六国宣言的消息在议会休会前一直没有发表，这显然是为了防止在议会中和其他地方发生再一次“爆炸”。
    马耶夫斯基最后说，广大阶层的英国人民要求他们的政府采取符合于英国民族利益的立场。事实说明，英国公众对于和平敌人破坏朝鲜停战、重燃远东战火的任何企图，将进行越来越强烈的反抗。
