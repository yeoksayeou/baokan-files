Nearly three thousand students from universities and technical secondary schools, who conducted production internships at Anshan Iron and Steel Company this summer, have concluded their enriching internship experiences and returned to their respective schools.

These internship students came from all over the country, including students from Harbin Institute of Technology, Northeast Institute of Technology, Northeast Institute of Geology, Dalian Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University in Beijing, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, and China University of Mining, as well as students from secondary industrial technical schools in Jilin, Benxi, and other places. Currently, except for 107 students from Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology and Northeast Institute of Geology who are continuing their internships, students from other schools have completed their internships and returned to their schools.

This internship greatly broadened the students' horizons. From the advanced and complex construction projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, they realized the significance and rich content of their various majors. Some internship students from the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University had a sense of complacency before coming to Anshan, believing that they had participated in campus construction and possessed some design and construction experience. However, after visiting some large-scale factory buildings in Anshan, especially after learning the methods of expanding factory buildings such as "replacing beams with girders" and "replacing the base of columns" adopted based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, they all felt that their past knowledge was insufficient and that they needed to learn more humbly. Some students majoring in industrial and civil construction in the Department of Civil Engineering once regarded industrial and civil construction as simple "house building," so their enthusiasm for learning was not high. After seeing many new and complex buildings in Anshan this time, they all felt that there was too much to learn and developed a strong interest in their major. Students from the Department of Metallurgy of Northeast Institute of Technology who interned at the iron-smelting plant developed an interest in blast furnace ironmaking and a deep affection for the blast furnace. One student said at the end of the internship that he would like to be with the blast furnace for life.

Through this internship, the students not only confirmed and enriched the theories they learned in class, but also laid the foundation for learning future courses well. The internship students from various schools carefully visited the relevant on-site equipment that they would learn about in textbooks and learned about general technical operations. Interns from the Northeast Institute of Geology, who will be studying drilling courses next semester, are conducting survey work with technicians from mines such as Gongchangling and Dagushan. In the past, many students at Tsinghua University did not pay enough attention to the "Construction Organization Planning" course, thinking that it was a course that enterprise management cadres should learn. This erroneous view was also corrected in this internship. Zheng Xiuyuan, a sophomore in the Department of Civil Engineering, said: "Now I deeply feel that to be a competent new-type engineer, you must not only have construction technology, but also have organizational skills." Therefore, they all told the teachers who guided the internship that they would definitely study the "Construction Organization Planning" course well next semester.

From the achievements of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in widely learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to carry out construction, the students from various schools deeply felt the superiority of Soviet textbooks. The internship students majoring in coke making from Dalian Institute of Technology, who interned at the Chemical Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, studied and helped the plant overcome the difficulties caused by the abnormal production of the regenerator based on the advanced theories of Soviet textbooks, saving a lot of wealth for the country. During the internship, they helped the plant complete 24 technical determinations and experiments, and put forward 26 suggestions for improving production, which were warmly praised by all the staff of the plant and rewarded by the plant.

The fact that these internship students were able to learn a lot of practical knowledge is inseparable from the enthusiastic guidance of the leaders of the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and various factories and mines, as well as the vast number of workers and technicians. Before the arrival of the internship teams from various schools, the person in charge of Anshan Iron and Steel Company convened a meeting of relevant cadres to specifically arrange the internship guidance work. After the interns arrived, the company's internship guidance committee, in addition to urging and supervising the internship guidance committees of various factories and mines to effectively guide students' internships, also organized 11 large-scale report meetings, where responsible cadres and engineers of the company introduced the construction overview of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in recent years to the students. Zhang Mingshan, Li Fengen, and other famous labor models were also invited to give reports. In the process of internship, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel gave the interns a lot of specific help.

### 今年暑期近三千名学生在鞍钢进行生产实习

    今年暑期近三千名学生在鞍钢进行生产实习
    今年暑期在鞍山钢铁公司进行生产实习的近三千名高等学校和中等技术学校学生，已经结束了丰富的实习生活先后返回学校。
    这批实习学生是来自全国各地的，有哈尔滨工业大学、东北工学院、东北地质学院、大连工学院的学生，有来自北京的清华大学、北京钢铁学院和中国矿业学院的学生，还有吉林、本溪等地的中等工业技术学校的学生。目前，除北京钢铁学院和东北地质学院一百零七名学生在继续实习外，其他各校学生都已结束实习返回学校。
    这次实习，使学生们大大地扩大了眼界，他们从鞍山钢铁公司的先进的复杂的建设工程中，认识到他们所学各种专业的重要意义和丰富的内容。清华大学建筑系有些实习学生来鞍山之前，存在着自满情绪，他们认为曾参加过建校工作，具备了一些设计和施工的经验。但他们在鞍山参观了一些规模巨大的厂房建筑特别是学习了根据苏联专家建议采用的“托梁换柱”、“托柱换基”等扩建厂房的方法以后，都感到过去所学的知识很不够，需要更加虚心学习。土木系工业与民用建筑专业有些学生，曾经把工业与民用建筑看成简单的“造房学”，因而学习情绪不高。他们这次在鞍山看到了许多新式复杂的建筑以后，都感到可学的东西太多了，对自己所学的专业产生了浓厚的兴趣。在炼铁厂实习的东北工学院冶金系学生由于对高炉炼铁发生了兴趣，对高炉也产生了深厚的感情。一个学生在结束实习时表示：他愿终生伴着高炉。
    通过这次实习，学生们不仅印证和充实了课堂上所学的理论，并为学好今后课程打下了基础。各校实习学生都仔细地参观了将要在课本中学到的有关现场的设备和了解了一般的技术操作情况。将在下学期要学习钻探课程的东北地质学院的实习生，正随弓长岭、大孤山等矿的技术人员进行勘测工作。清华大学过去许多学生对“施工组织规划”课不够重视，认为这是企业管理干部应学的课程。这种错误看法也在这次实习中得到了纠正。土木系二年级学生郑秀瑗说：“现在我深深感到，要想做一个称职的新型工程师，不仅要具备施工技术，还必须具有组织才能。”因此，他们都向指导实习的教师表示：下学期一定学好“施工组织规划”课。
    从鞍山钢铁公司广泛学习苏联先进经验进行建设的成就中，各校学生深切感到苏联教材的优越性。在鞍山钢铁公司化工总厂实习的大连工学院炼焦专业的实习学生们，曾根据苏联教材的先进理论，研究并帮助该厂克服了因再生器生产不正常而发生的困难，为国家节省了大量财富。他们在实习中帮助该厂完成了二十四件有关技术的测定、试验，提出了二十六件改进生产的建议，受到该厂全体职工们的热烈赞许和厂方的奖励。
    这批实习学生能学到许多实际知识，是与中共鞍山市委会、青年团鞍山市委会、鞍山钢铁公司和各厂矿领导及广大工人、技术人员们的热心指导分不开的。在各校实习队到来之前，鞍山钢铁公司负责人召集各有关干部开会，具体布置了实习指导工作。实习生到达以后，该公司实习指导委员会除督促检查各厂矿实习指导委员会切实指导学生实习外，并组织了十一次大型报告会，由公司负责干部和工程师给学生们介绍鞍山钢铁公司几年来的建设概况，还请张明山、李凤恩等著名的劳动模范作报告。在实习过程中，鞍钢的工人们给实习学生们许多具体的帮助。    （新华社）
