    On August 27th, we repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war (all American) and 249 Korean prisoners of war to the other side, totaling 399.
    The other side repatriated 2,396 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to us.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 28th: On August 28th, we repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war and 249 Korean prisoners of war to the other side.

    The other side repatriated 2,399 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to us (including two sick and wounded personnel).
    One of the two sick and wounded personnel who returned today, named Zhu Zhongyuan, was injured by stones thrown by three ignorant South Korean youths exploited by the U.S. side on the way from Munsan to Panmunjom at 11:00 a.m. today. When he arrived at our exchange area, his forehead was still bleeding. The other, named Yin Yunhao, had been suffering from dysentery for seven days. He complained that the U.S. side did not treat him and he only received a bowl of cold watery porridge every day.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 29th: On August 29th, we repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war and 250 Korean prisoners of war to the other side. The non-Korean prisoners of war included 145 Americans, 3 Turks, and 2 Australians. The total number of prisoners of war we repatriated to the other side was 400.
    The other side repatriated 2,399 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to us.
    At 11:30 a.m. today, when our returning personnel were passing over Panmunjom Bridge in repatriation vehicles, a South Korean soldier jumped out of a medium-sized jeep (vehicle number 2422087) from the U.S. side and beat our captured personnel on the vehicle with a wooden棒. At the same time, a group of American soldiers on the roadside threw stones at our captured personnel, and a captured personnel named Lu Tai Dou was hit in the chest.
    The captured personnel who returned today said that they departed from Geoje Island on the 26th and arrived in Incheon on the 28th. During the 52-hour sea voyage, they only ate two meals of sorghum porridge. A returning personnel named Jin Zhiwen also said: More than 50 of us were held in a cabin with very little air, and two American soldiers stood at the entrance of the cabin, carrying two gas bombs with them.
    Jin Zhiwen and others came from the U.S. 17th Prisoner of War Camp on Geoje Island. He also complained: On August 17th, when our captured personnel were singing patriotic songs in the prisoner of war camp square, American troops suddenly rushed in from all directions and released many gas bombs, injuring more than 700 of our captured personnel on the spot, including 13 seriously injured.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 30th: On August 30th, we repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war and 248 Korean prisoners of war to the other side. The non-Korean prisoners of war included 110 Americans, 25 British, 5 Filipinos, 4 Turks, 3 French, and 3 from the Union of South Africa. The total number of prisoners of war we repatriated to the other side was 398.
    The other side repatriated 2,398 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to us.
    The captured personnel who returned today said: Since they departed from Geoje Island on the 27th, they had only eaten two meals of sorghum porridge in more than 60 hours, making them dizzy with hunger. During the sea voyage, the American troops deliberately used urine buckets to hold seawater and forced our captured personnel to drink it. Two of our captured personnel protested against this humiliating behavior by the U.S. side and were unreasonably beaten with rifle butts by the American troops.
