Comrade Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Moscow:

	On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the liberation of the Korean people from the rule of Japanese imperialism by the heroic Soviet Army, on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and all the Korean people, I extend warm congratulations and deep gratitude to you, esteemed Chairman, and through you to the Soviet government, all the Soviet people, and the Soviet Army.

	The great Soviet people not only brought freedom to the Korean people groaning under the rule of Japanese imperialism, but also opened up broad avenues for the development and prosperity of our country.

	The Korean people look with a high sense of pride at the brilliant achievements they have made in the past eight years. While welcoming their national holiday, they are even more clearly aware that strengthening friendship with the Soviet people is a solid guarantee for the freedom, unification, independence and future development of our country. The Korean people cherish Korean-Soviet friendship as they cherish their own eyes, and are filled with a firm determination to develop and strengthen this friendship with all their strength.

	The Soviet government and the Soviet people have given all kinds of assistance to the Korean people, who have overcome all the pain and trials in the arduous Fatherland Liberation War of the past three years, achieved historic victory, and are now resuming peaceful endeavors, which is one of the decisive guarantees for the victorious restoration of all the cities, villages and people's economy destroyed by the war.

	This time, the news of the Soviet government's aid of 1 billion rubles to the Korean people has spread like a wave throughout the Republic, and the Korean people express the infinite love and gratitude of the entire nation to the fraternal Soviet people. This will become a new source of strength and material basis for further inspiring our people to march towards a glorious victory in the struggle for the rapid restoration and development of the people's economy of our Republic.

	Our Korean people, learning from the valuable and rich experience of the Soviet people, will surely achieve great results in the cause of restoring and developing the people's economy destroyed by the war, and complete the peaceful unification of our country.

	The great Soviet communist construction and its brilliant achievements inspire all peace-loving people on earth to fight for lasting peace in the world.

	Glory to the liberator of the Korean people, the closest friend, the bastion of peace and democracy in the world -- the great Soviet Union!

	Long live the eternal friendship between Korea and the Soviet Union!
