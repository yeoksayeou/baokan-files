Xinhua News Agency, Bitong, August 15th: The Red Cross personnel of the Korean-Chinese side are subjected to unreasonable restrictions and rough treatment in South Korea, in sharp contrast to the various conveniences given by our side to the United Nations forces' Red Cross personnel who inspect our prisoner-of-war camps. The chief representative of the United Nations forces side of the joint Red Cross team currently inspecting prisoner-of-war camps in North Korea, Roy Jerome of Britain, believes: "The treatment and cooperation we receive can be called exemplary."

    As usual, the team starts working without delay upon arrival at the prisoner-of-war camp. Before starting work, the prisoner-of-war camp authorities and the joint Red Cross team always hold detailed consultations, and the opinions of the joint Red Cross team are always respected.

    The joint Red Cross team working in South Korea is only allowed to talk to prisoners of war in the evening, while in North Korea, the joint team can use the best time of day to talk to prisoners of war. Jild Krahn of the United States commented on the timetable proposed by the prisoner-of-war camp authorities as "most acceptable."

    Red Cross personnel do not have to talk to prisoners of war through barbed wire fences, as they do in South Korea; they can talk freely and leisurely in rooms. The representatives of the United States, Britain, and Canada often ask the prisoners of war one question after another, but no one limits their conversation time. These conversations are often terminated at the request of the joint team members.

    The joint Red Cross team can freely visit the prisoner-of-war camp. The Red Cross personnel inspected various facilities for prisoners of war, such as housing, hospitals, kitchens, clubs, and sports fields, and the staff of the prisoner-of-war camp provided detailed explanations.

    Jild Krahn's words after visiting the 12th prisoner-of-war camp reflect the feelings of the United Nations forces' Red Cross personnel about the cooperation of the prisoner-of-war camp authorities. He said, "I am very grateful for the cooperation of the prisoner-of-war camp authorities."

    Korean-Chinese Red Cross personnel were attacked by poison gas in South Korea, while representatives from the United States, Britain, Denmark, Turkey, Canada, and South Korea received every convenience in North Korea. The prisoner-of-war camp authorities took good care of the daily needs, stationery supplies, and entertainment of the joint Red Cross team members.

    Roy Jerome of Britain, on behalf of the Red Cross representatives of the United Nations forces, said to the staff of the prisoner-of-war camp, "I am very grateful to you for all these arrangements. We feel very comfortable here."

### 我方给予对方红十字会人员以各种便利  与美方对我红十字会人员的无理限制和待遇成鲜明对比

    我方给予对方红十字会人员以各种便利
    与美方对我红十字会人员的无理限制和待遇成鲜明对比
    【新华社碧潼十五日电】朝中方面的红十字会人员在南朝鲜受到无理的限制和粗暴的待遇，与此形成鲜明的对比的是，视察我方战俘营的联合国军方面的红十字会人员得到我方所给予的各种便利。现在在北朝鲜视察战俘营的联合红十字会小组联合国军方面的首席代表、英国的罗埃·朱洛姆认为：“我们受到的待遇以及合作的情况堪称模范。”
    照例小组一到战俘营就毫不迟延地开始工作。在开始工作以前，战俘营当局和联合红十字会小组双方总是进行详尽的磋商，而联合红十字会小组的意见总是受到尊重。
    在南朝鲜工作的联合红十字会小组只准在晚间跟战俘谈话，而在北朝鲜联合小组却可以利用一天中最好的时间来跟战俘谈话。美国的吉尔德·克朗就战俘营当局提出的时间表所作的评论是“最能令人接受的”。
    红十字会人员不必像在南朝鲜一样，隔着铁丝网跟战俘谈话，他们可以在房间里自由地从容地交谈。美、英、加三国代表问战俘的问题往往一个接着一个，然而并没有人限制他们交谈的时间。这些交谈常常都是在联合小组人员的请求下中止的。
    联合红十字会小组可以自由访问战俘营。红十字会人员视察了战俘用的各种设备，如住房、医院、厨房、俱乐部和运动场等，而且战俘营的工作人员给以详细的解释。
    吉尔德·克朗在访问了第十二号战俘营后所说的话反映出联合国军方面红十字会人员对战俘营当局的合作的感想，他说，“我对战俘营当局的合作非常感激”。
    朝中红十字会人员在南朝鲜受到了毒气弹的攻击，而美国、英国、丹麦、土耳其、加拿大和南朝鲜的代表们在北朝鲜得到了一切便利。战俘营当局很好地照顾到联合红十字会小组人员们的日常需要、文具供应和娱乐生活。
    英国的罗埃·朱洛姆代表联合国军方面红十字会代表们向战俘营工作人员说，“我为这一切安排十分感谢你们。我们在这里感到很舒服。”
