Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 18th: TASS, New York, August 18th: The United Nations Seventh General Assembly reconvened on the afternoon of August 17th to resume discussion of the Korean question.
	The President of the General Assembly, Pearson, delivered a brief opening speech at the plenary session, saying that since the Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed, "we can now move forward to the next stage of peace and construction." He said he was sure that all representatives, like the rest of the world, were relieved that the killing had finally stopped. Pearson called for turning the Korean armistice into peace.
	Pearson said he hoped the Assembly would prepare for the political conference "with a minimum of debate and a maximum of agreement and goodwill." Pearson believed that the Assembly's task was not to "discuss the substance of a peaceful settlement of the Korean question," but only to prepare a body to resolve the problem. He concluded by saying that, therefore, if there were no objections, he would ask the Chairman of the Political Committee to convene a meeting of the Political Committee on the morning of August 18 to begin considering the matter.
	Pearson then announced that there were no objections, and his suggestion was adopted. The United Nations General Assembly plenary session then adjourned.

    联合国第七届大会复会讨论朝鲜问题
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：联合国第七届大会在八月十七日下午复会，恢复讨论朝鲜问题。
    大会主席皮尔逊在大会全体会议上发表简短的开幕词，他说，由于朝鲜停战协定已经签订，“我们现在可以向前进入下一个和平与建设的阶段”。他说，他确信全体代表会和全世界一样，为杀戮终于停止而感到宽慰。皮尔逊呼吁把朝鲜停战化为和平。
    皮尔逊说，他希望大会能“以最少的争论和最大限度的协议及善意”为政治会议作准备。皮尔逊认为大会的任务不在“讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的实质问题”，而仅在于准备一个解决问题的机构。他最后说，因此，如果没有反对意见，他将要求政治委员会主席在八月十八日上午召开政治委员会会议，开始考虑这个问题。
    皮尔逊接着宣布，没有反对意见，他的建议通过。联合国大会全体会议至此便告休会。
