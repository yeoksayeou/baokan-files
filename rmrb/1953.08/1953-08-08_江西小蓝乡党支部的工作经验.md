    Work Experience of the Xiaolan Township Party Branch in Jiangxi
    The Rural Party Building Work Group of the Organization Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The Xiaolan Township Party Branch in Nanchang County, Jiangxi, was established in March 1950. Over the past three years, this branch has achieved remarkable success in leading both the land reform review work and agricultural production. Regarding mutual aid and cooperation for patriotic production increase, after the branch educated the masses on the direction of rural economic development, 40% of the farmers in the township have been organized; on the basis of this organization, the agricultural production index in 1952 reached 136.5% of the highest output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. With the development of production, the lives of the masses have also greatly improved.
    The work experience of this branch is now introduced below.

    Strict Party life improves the ideological consciousness of Party members
    In the spring of 1952, as soon as the land reform review work in Xiaolan Township ended, most of the backbone members of the branch were transferred to work in other places; in addition, the district cadres working in this township did not actively strengthen the ideological leadership of the branch, mobilizing Party members to actively lead and participate in various tasks, but instead took over everything personally. As a result, the branch did not immediately form a new leadership core. Party members were just running errands and calling people to meetings, and some Party members became uneasy about their work. During the democratic political construction phase, some Party members even went to various groups to mobilize the masses not to elect them as cadres. However, the branch quickly discovered these problems and reported them to the county committee. Under the leadership of the county committee, the branch organized all Party members to study "A Communist Party Member's Reader," which enabled most Party members to understand the prospects of communism. At the same time, the district cadres working in this township also reviewed their practice of taking over everything at the branch meeting, and many Party members also voluntarily examined their thoughts of being uneasy about their work. After this, Party members began to feel at ease in their work, and various tasks improved again. The branch realized the importance of ideological education for Party members and established a learning system.

    In the winter, some Party members developed the mistaken idea that "there is no future in rural work," especially after seeing Party members in the township who had left production to participate in work and had now been promoted to district chief and deputy secretary of the district committee. They wanted to leave production to work outside, or go to work in factories. In addition, a few Party members did not raise and resolve some opinions they clearly had with each other. After studying these situations, the branch committee promptly led everyone to study the eight criteria for a Communist Party member, and linked this to examining their own ideology, work style, and methods. After studying the eight criteria for Party members, Luo Jiugen reviewed and said: "I complain that the Party does not promote me, which means that I want the Party's interests to be subordinate to my personal interests, which does not meet the standards of a Party member. I guarantee that I will work with peace of mind in the future." Luo Shuiquan also reviewed and said: "I want to leave production to participate in work, and I say that I want to do more things, but in reality, I am seeking personal enjoyment, not for work. This is very wrong, and I will definitely correct this mistake in the future." Some Party members also examined the phenomenon of disunity.

    Another feature of the Xiaolan Township branch's education and improvement of Party members is that it strictly followed the provisions of the Party Constitution to improve the Party's organizational life, and correctly carried out criticism and self-criticism within the Party. The development of criticism and self-criticism was gradually carried out on the basis of the Party members' ideological consciousness. In the early days of the branch's establishment, Party members were very enthusiastic about attending Party meetings, but each meeting was just a routine review by each person before the meeting adjourned, and the problems were not resolved. As a result, the enthusiasm of Party members for attending Party meetings soon declined. Some said: "We have meetings today and meetings tomorrow. Meetings are just reviews, and the problems are not solved after the reviews." Some Party members expressed boredom with such meetings and simply did not attend; even if they came to the meeting, they were just going through the motions.

    After the district committee discovered this situation, it immediately instructed the Xiaolan Township branch to convene a branch committee meeting to study solutions. After research, it was determined that: on the one hand, the branch secretary should repeatedly explain the purpose and role of carrying out criticism and self-criticism to Party members; on the other hand, the content and method of Party meetings should be immediately improved, and it should be proposed that future Party meetings should be combined with work and with the ideological situation of Party members; there should not only be criticism but also praise, and not only raise problems but also solve problems; there should be preparation before the meeting. Since then, the content of Party meetings has become increasingly rich. For example, Party member Luo Shiqiu was dragging his feet in his work and could not resolutely implement the Party's resolutions. The branch decided to conduct a criticism and education session for him; before the session, the branch secretary convened the branch committee members to exchange views and discuss the content, method, and problems to be solved in this Party meeting, and then convened a branch general meeting. At the meeting, Luo Shiqiu first made a review, and then criticism was launched.

    After everyone spoke, the branch secretary summarized everyone's opinions, emphasizing in particular the improvement methods in the future. With the help and education of the branch, Luo Shiqiu changed and became active in his work. In this way, the content of the meeting life became rich and lively, and the problems existing inside and outside the Party at various times could be solved in a timely manner. The Xiaolan Township branch's organizational life system has been maintained in this way. In their own words, "Without organizational life, problems will arise in ideology and work; without organizational life, it is like something is missing in life."

    Propagating Party policies and stabilizing the production mood of the masses
    Every year, when the higher authorities issued a call for patriotic production increase, everyone lacked confidence. They said: "We were asked to increase production last year, and we are asked to increase production again this year. There is no end to increasing production; the land is not rubber that can be stretched!" "To harvest a thousand catties per mu, even with the straw, it is not enough, unless we add mud." When the branch studied this situation, it believed that: increasing production and growing more grain is originally the spontaneous demand of farmers, so why do farmers lack confidence in increasing production? This question was answered after the branch investigated. Of the more than 2,700 mu of land in the township, there were only 65 head of cattle, obviously a lack of animal power; and fertilizer was even more scarce, with the township only accumulating more than 32,000 dan of liquid fertilizer and more than 30,000 dan of pond mud, and each mu of land could not be divided into even 25 dan of fertilizer, including pond mud. So they generally lacked confidence in striving for increased production. They said: "We talk about increasing production, but without cattle and fertilizer, it is just empty talk." In addition, a small number of people had fears of showing wealth, and some farmers did not dare to expand production. These seriously hindered the development of the patriotic production increase movement.

    In order to remove these obstacles, the branch first organized village cadres, Party members, League members, and propagandists to study and discuss the Central Committee's instructions on spring ploughing production and the ten measures of the Central South Administrative Committee on carrying out the agricultural patriotic production increase movement, and then went deep into the masses to publicize them, stabilizing the production mood of the masses; at the same time, it mobilized Party members, cadres, and the masses to find ways to increase production. The masses themselves also realized: "There is always so much land, and if we want to increase production, we have to find a way." As the saying goes: "To raise a good cub, you need a good mother; to grow good fields, you need good seedlings." Therefore, everyone first went to find ways to improve varieties. Someone proposed changing to plant "Nante No. 1" rice. "Nante No. 1" rice was tried in 1950. Although this kind of rice could harvest five dou more rice per mu than "Fifty Early" rice, "Nante No. 1" matured a week later than "Fifty Early", and more fertilizer was also applied, which affected the cultivation time of the second season field. At that time, someone had proposed: Why can't "Nante No. 1" be changed to plant in the second season field? What would happen if it was planted a few days earlier? In 1952, the original branch secretary Luo Laigui conducted an experiment of planting a few days earlier on his two mu of land, and the result was very good, increasing production by 200 jin of rice per mu. On the day of threshing, representatives from various villages came to visit. At that time, the people who visited said: The trick to increasing production is here. If all of the more than 1,700 mu of second season fields in the township were changed to "Nante No. 1," and the average yield increased by 100 jin per mu, wouldn't that increase production by 170,000 jin of rice! So many people decided to change to "Nante No. 1," and the township exchanged 14,000 jin of "Nante No. 1" seeds. The usual practice of "soaking seeds during Qingming and plowing fields during Guyu" was generally broken, and seeds were soaked early. At the same time, last winter, the branch led the masses of the township to repair nine ponds, build a new reservoir, repair the Fuhe embankment for more than 150 zhang, and dig rice roots to eradicate insect pests; and carried out a large amount of fertilizer accumulation work. The township accumulated a total of more than 48,500 dan of liquid fertilizer, more than 40,000 dan of pond mud, and more than 20,000 dan of turf, plus other fertilizers such as plant ash, lime, oil cake, and fertilizer powder, and each mu of field had 50 dan of fertilizer. With the support of government loans, the farmers carried out mutual aid and mutual borrowing and purchased 46 more cattle. Before the spring ploughing in 1953, all preparations were made early, so the rice seedlings were transplanted earlier this spring.

    Overcoming the "Five Many" phenomenon and strengthening the leadership of the branch
    Before last winter, Xiaolan Township, like rural areas everywhere, seriously suffered from the "Five Many" phenomenon. There was a lot of work and urgent tasks, but the people doing the work were just a few Party member cadres. Party members themselves also believed that: if you are a Party member, you have to take the lead in everything, so the Party members were too busy to breathe. For example, branch secretary Luo Haibao held 20 positions concurrently, deputy branch secretary Yuan Zhixiu held 16 positions concurrently, and other Party members also held several positions concurrently. This not only affected the production of Party members and cadres themselves; but also, because there was a lot of work and urgent tasks, sometimes mandatory orders were used to complete the tasks. For example, during flood prevention last year, the district called once and said that a certain number of people must go to work at a certain time, and some people were unwilling to go. Party member cadres did not do propaganda and education work, but believed that the masses were backward, and mandatory orders had to be used, so they adopted the method of imposing "big hats" and fining workdays, forcing the masses to do it. This not only affected the completion of the flood prevention task, but also caused great dissatisfaction among the masses.

    In order to overcome commandism, the branch organized Party members to study in a timely manner. Through study, everyone understood that the policies of our Party and the interests of the masses are consistent. We cannot be impatient in doing work. If the masses do not understand the ideology for a while, we can only carry out persuasion and education and wait patiently. Commandism violates the principle of voluntary participation by the masses, and the result will inevitably be to alienate the masses, and then nothing can be done well. On this ideological basis, they further studied ways to overcome the "Five Many" phenomenon. Branch Secretary Luo Haibao returned from visiting the Soviet Union last year and heard many reports in Beijing and Hankou. These reports clearly pointed out that the main content of rural work is to lead agricultural production, and production is the central task that overrides everything else. Luo Haibao, based on the spirit of these reports, conveyed this to all Party members of the branch, and introduced the experience of the Soviet collective farm Party organizations in leading production. Finally, he contacted the specific situation of the branch for discussion. After the ideological understanding was clarified, the eleven Party members participated in various mutual aid groups respectively to strengthen and improve the leadership of the mutual aid groups. Clear division of labor was carried out between branch committee members and Party members. This division of labor was based on the nature of the work. Branch Secretary Luo Haibao (Chairman of the Farmers Association) was mainly responsible for considering production issues in the township; Deputy Branch Secretary Yuan Zhixiu (Township Mayor) considered more administrative issues in the township; other branch committee members were responsible for leading and contacting mass organizations; and general Party members were responsible for contracting and contacting the masses by area based on their residence. Whenever the branch assigned work tasks, if it was necessary to pass it on to the masses through mass organizations, the Party member cadres responsible for each mass organization would pass it on and supervise it separately, which reduced many meetings. In the process of work, the Party meetings checked the implementation of each Party member's work. In this way, the division of labor was clear, the responsibilities were clear, which not only reduced the number of concurrent positions, but also gave full play to the core leadership role of the branch. At the same time, the role of mass organizations was fully utilized, avoiding the chaotic phenomenon of Party members having to go everywhere.

    Due to the adoption of the above measures, not only was the contradiction between "work and production" of Party member cadres resolved, but also the style of taking over everything and commandism was overcome. For example, the above methods were used to assign flood prevention tasks this year. The branch's youth committee member was responsible for mobilizing the youth, female Party members Mei Guimei (director of the township women's federation) and Tu Cuilian were responsible for mobilizing women to weave grass bags for flood prevention, security committee member Luo Laibao was responsible for leading the militia to protect the dike, deputy branch secretary (township mayor) Yuan Zhixiu was responsible for raising flood prevention materials, and branch secretary Luo Haibao was responsible for overall leadership. After full mobilization and education, with the leading actions of Party members, League members, cadres, and activists, more than 300 young and middle-aged men and women in the township actively participated in the flood prevention work and successfully completed the flood prevention task. Party members and cadres realized from the comparison of the two flood prevention works before and after: "The mass line is good, and commandism does not solve the problem."

    江西小蓝乡党支部的工作经验
    中共江西省委组织部农村建党工作组
    江西南昌县小蓝乡党支部是在一九五○年三月间开始建立的。三年多来这个支部无论在领导土地改革复查工作或领导农业生产工作上都获得了显著的成绩。以互助合作爱国增产来说，经过支部对群众进行农村经济发展方向的教育后，全乡已有百分之四十的农户组织起来了；在组织起来的基础上，一九五二年农业生产的指数，已达到抗日战争前最高产量的百分之一百三十六点五。随着生产的发展，群众的生活也大大改善了。
    现在把这个支部的工作经验介绍于后。
    严格的党的生活，提高了党员的思想觉悟
    一九五二年春天，小蓝乡土地改革的复查工作一结束，支部的骨干大部分被抽调到外地去工作；加上在这个乡工作的区干部，不是积极加强对支部的思想领导，发动党员积极领导和参加各种工作，而是个人包办代替，因而支部没有立即形成新的领导核心。党员只是跑腿喊人开会；党员中就有人不安心工作。在民主建政阶段，有些党员还分头到各小组去动员群众不要选自己当干部。但是支部很快发现了这些问题，并反映到县委会。在县委的领导下，支部组织全体党员学习了“共产党员读本”，使大多数党员懂得了共产主义的远景。同时，在这个乡工作的区干部也在支部大会上检讨了自己的包办代替作风，许多党员也都自动地检查了不安心工作的思想。这以后，党员开始安心工作了，各种工作又有了起色。支部由此体会到了对党员进行思想教育的重要性，并规定了学习制度。
    到了冬天，又有些党员产生了“农村工作没出路”的错误思想，特别是看到本乡脱离生产参加工作的党员，现在已提拔为区长、区委副书记，就想脱离生产出去工作，或是进工厂去工作。另外少数党员之间明明有些意见也不提出来解决。支委会研究了这些情况后，就及时地领导大家学习了共产党员的八项标准条件，并联系检查自己的思想作风与工作方法。罗九根在学习了党员的八项标准以后检讨说：“我埋怨党不提拔我，这就是要党的利益服从个人的利益，这就不合党员的标准。今后保证安心工作。”罗水泉也检讨说：“我想脱离生产参加工作，口头上说想作更多的事情，实际上是图个人享受，并不是为工作，这是很不对的，今后一定改正这个错误。”有些党员还检查了不团结的现象。
    小蓝乡支部教育提高党员的另一个特点，是严格地遵照党章的规定健全了党的组织生活，在党内正确地开展了批评与自我批评，而批评与自我批评的开展，是在党员思想觉悟的基础上逐渐开展起来的。支部刚建立的时期，党员对参加党的会议情绪都很高，但是每次会议都是各人照例地检讨一遍后就散会，问题得不到解决，因而党员对参加党的会议的热情不久就低落下来。有的说：“今天开会，明天开会，开会就是检讨，检讨了又不解决问题。”有的党员对这样的会议表示厌倦，干脆不到会；有的即使来开会，也只是应付应付。
    区委发现了这一情况后，当即指示小蓝乡支部召开支委会研究解决的办法。经研究后确定：一方面由支部书记向党员反复地讲解开展批评与自我批评的目的与作用；另一方面立即改进党的会议的内容和方式，提出今后党的会议应结合工作，结合党员的思想情况进行；不仅有批评还要有表扬，不仅提出问题，还要解决问题；会前要有准备。此后，党的会议内容是日渐丰富起来了。如党员罗时球工作上拖拖拉拉，党的决议不能坚决执行，支部决定对他进行一次批评和教育；事前支部书记召集了支部委员一起交换了意见，商讨了这次党的会议的内容、方式及解决些什么问题，然后再召开支部大会。会上，罗时球先作了检讨，接着便展开了批评。
    在大家发言以后，支部书记又总结了大家的意见，其中特别强调了今后的改进办法。罗时球在支部的帮助和教育下有了转变，对工作积极起来了。这样，使会议生活的内容丰富生动了，而且各个时期党内外存在的问题也能及时得到解决。小蓝乡支部的组织生活制度就这样坚持下来了。用他们自己总结的话说：“不过组织生活，在思想上、工作上就会出毛病；不过组织生活就好像生活中缺了一样东西似的。”
    宣传党的政策，稳定群众生产情绪
    每年上级发出爱国增产号召，大家都没有信心。他们说：“去年叫增产，今年又叫增产，增产不是无边无界的；田地可不是橡皮能够拉长的呀！”“每亩收千斤，连禾秆算上也不够，除非加上泥巴。”支部研究这一情况时认为：增加产量，多打粮食，这本来是农民的自发要求，农民又为什么对增产没信心呢？这个问题经支部调查后便得到了说明。全乡二千七百多亩田地，只有六十五头耕牛，显然畜力是缺乏的；而肥料更是缺乏，全乡只积了三万二千多担水肥和三万多担塘泥，每亩地连塘泥在内，还分不到二十五担肥料。所以他们对争取增产普遍没有信心。他们说：“口里讲增产，没有牛没有肥还不是一句空话。”另有一小部分人有怕露富的思想，有些农民就不敢扩大生产。这些都严重地妨碍了爱国增产运动的开展。
    为了扫除这些障碍，支部首先组织了村干部、党员、团员、宣传员学习和讨论了中央关于春耕生产的指示及中南行政委员会关于开展农业爱国增产运动的十项措施，然后深入群众中宣传，稳定了群众的生产情绪；同时，发动党员、干部、群众找增产办法。群众自己也认识到：“田地总是这样多，要增产就得想办法。”俗话说：“养崽要好娘，种田要好秧。”因此大家首先从改良品种上去找窍门。有人提出了改种“南特号”稻谷，本来“南特号”稻谷在一九五○年就试种过，这种稻谷虽然比“五十早”谷每亩要多收谷子五斗，但“南特号”比“五十早”迟熟一个星期，肥料也施得多，这样就影响了二季田的耕作时间。当时曾有人提出：“南特号”为什么不能改种二季田呢？如果早种几天的话会怎么样呢？一九五二年原支部书记罗来贵就在自己的二亩田里作了早种几天的试验，结果很好，每亩地增产了二百斤稻谷。打场的那天，各村都派代表来参观，当时参观的人都说：增产的窍门就在这里，全乡一千七百多亩二季田如果全改种上“南特号”的话，平均每亩增产一百斤，那不是要增产十七万斤稻谷！于是许多人都决定改种“南特号”，全乡就换了一万四千斤“南特号”种籽。普遍打破了“清明浸种、谷雨沤田”的惯例，做到提早浸种。同时去年冬天支部已带领全乡群众修好了九口塘，新建一个水库、培修抚河大堤一百五十余丈，挖稻根根除虫害；并进行了大量的积肥工作，全乡共积了水肥四万八千五百多担，塘泥四万多担，草皮二万多担，加上草木灰、石灰、枯饼、肥田粉等其他肥料，每亩田已有肥料五十担。在政府贷款扶持下，农民们进行互助互借又购买了四十六条耕牛。一九五三年春耕以前，早做好了一切准备，因此，今年春天做到了提早插秧。
    克服“五多”现象，加强支部领导工作
    小蓝乡在去年冬季以前，也和各地农村一样严重地存在着“五多”现象，工作多，任务急，但做工作的就是那几个党员干部。党员自己也认为：是党员吧，就得样样带头，因此，党员们忙的透不过气来。如支部书记罗海保身兼二十职，副支部书记袁芝秀身兼十六职，其他党员也都是一身数职。这不但影响了党员、干部自己的生产；而且更由于工作多、任务急，有时就用强迫命令来完成任务。如去年防洪期间，一次区上来电话说某时某刻一定要多少人去工作，有些人就不愿意去。党员干部不去做宣传教育工作，而是认为群众落后，非强迫命令不行，于是就采取扣“大帽子”和罚工的办法，逼着群众去做。这样不仅影响了防洪任务的完成，而且引起了群众很大的不满。
    为了克服命令主义，支部又及时组织党员进行了学习。通过学习，使大家了解了我们党的政策和群众利益是一致的。做工作不能犯急性病，群众一时思想不通，只能进行说服教育，耐心地等待，而命令主义是违反了群众自愿的原则，其结果必然会脱离群众，那就什么事也做不好。在这样的思想基础上，他们又进一步研究了克服“五多”的办法。支部书记罗海保去年从苏联参观回来，在北京和汉口听过了很多报告，这些报告中都曾明确地指出了农村工作的主要内容是领导农业生产，生产是压倒一切的中心工作。罗海保根据这些报告的精神，向支部的全体党员进行了传达，又介绍了苏联集体农庄党组织领导生产的经验，最后联系本支部的具体情况进行了讨论。在思想认识明确后，十一个党员即分别参加各个互助组，以加强和健全互助组的领导。在支部委员及党员之间又进行了明确的分工，这种分工是按工作性质分的；支部书记罗海保（农民协会主席）主要负责考虑全乡生产问题；副支部书记袁芝秀（乡长）多考虑全乡行政工作方面的问题；其他支部委员分别负责对群众团体的领导和联系；一般党员则是按居住情况分片包干联系群众。每当支部布置工作任务时，需要通过群众团体传达到群众中去的，则由负责各个群众团体的党员干部，分头传达并作检查督促，这样就减少了许多会议。工作进行过程中，党的会议上结合检查每个党员工作执行的情况。这样，分工明确、责任清楚，既减少了兼职，又发挥了支部的核心领导作用，同时对群众团体的作用也就充分发挥起来了，避免了事事要党员去的忙乱现象。
    由于采取了上述措施，不但解决了党员干部“工作与生产”的矛盾，而且还克服了包办代替和命令主义的作风。如今年布置防洪任务时就采用了上述办法进行的。支部青年委员负责动员青年，妇女党员梅桂妹（乡妇女主任）、凃翠莲负责动员妇女编织防洪用的草包，保卫委员罗来保负责领导民兵护堤，副支部书记（乡长）袁芝秀负责筹措防洪材料，支部书记罗海保负责全面领导。在经过充分动员教育后，在党员、团员、干部、积极分子的带头行动下，全乡有三百多个青壮男女，积极参加了防洪工作，顺利地完成了防洪任务。党员、干部从前后两次防洪工作的对比中认识到：“群众路线就是好，强迫命令就是不解决问题。”
