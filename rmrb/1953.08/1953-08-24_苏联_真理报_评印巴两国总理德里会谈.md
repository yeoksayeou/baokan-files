Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 22nd (TASS dispatch): "Pravda" published an article by Orestov, commenting on the talks held in Delhi between Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali, which concluded on August 20th, with the Kashmir issue as the main topic. The author wrote: The talks on the Kashmir issue have made significant progress, and agreements have been reached on some issues, bringing the date of a peaceful resolution closer; peace-loving countries are very happy to hear this news.

    The joint communiqué issued from Delhi and Karachi shows that the two Prime Ministers have firmly decided to work together peacefully to resolve the Kashmir issue and other disputes between the two countries in a way that is beneficial to both. They have agreed that the future status of Kashmir should be decided by the people of Kashmir themselves through a free plebiscite.

    The official responsible for conducting the plebiscite will not be appointed by the United Nations Commissioner for Kashmir, American Admiral Nimitz, but will be hired from a small European or Asian country; the people of both countries are very satisfied to hear this news.

    Orestov pointed out that the Indian government and the Pakistani government, understanding the many demands of the people of both countries, have adopted the method of direct consultation without foreign "arbitrators," "mediators," and "observers," which has made the first success in resolving the Kashmir issue possible.

    Orestov wrote: The recent situation in Kashmir shows that certain aggressive foreign forces have not yet abandoned their hope of obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue and turning Kashmir into their strategic base. For example, Washington's strategists are looking for opportunities to allow American troops to enter Kashmir under the banner of the United Nations.

    Orestov pointed out: Due to foreign interference, the Kashmir dispute has been deadlocked for more than five years without a resolution. The people of India and Pakistan, especially the people of Kashmir, have reason to be angry about this fact. Indian Prime Minister Nehru publicly stated three months ago that if there had been no interference from other countries, the Kashmir issue might have been resolved already.

    However, the conspiracies of the enemies of peace have been firmly opposed by the people of Kashmir themselves.

    A tool of foreign agents, Kashmir Prime Minister Abdullah, was removed from office and arrested on August 9th.

    The new government of Kashmir has had to take urgent measures to stop the activities of foreign agents who are seriously interfering in Kashmir's internal affairs.

    Orestov concluded by writing: The talks between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan have pointed out the path to solving the complex Kashmir issue. For the sake of peace and the interests of the people of Kashmir, efforts must continue to be made to peacefully resolve this dispute.

    苏联“真理报”评印巴两国总理德里会谈
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：“真理报”刊载奥列斯托夫的文章，评述已于八月二十日在德里结束的印度总理尼赫鲁和巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里所进行的以克什米尔问题为主要议题的商谈。作者写道：关于克什米尔问题的商谈已经有了显著的进展，而且在一些问题上取得了协议，从而使和平解决这一问题的日期较为接近；爱好和平的国家听到这个消息，十分高兴。
    从德里和喀拉蚩发表的联合公报可以看到：两国总理已经坚决地决定用和平方法共同努力在对两国都有利的情况下解决克什米尔问题和两国之间的其他争执问题。他们已经同意：克什米尔的未来地位的问题应由克什米尔人民自己用自由的公民投票来决定。
    负责主持公民投票的官员将不是由联合国驻克什米尔专员美国海军上将尼米兹任命，而是从欧洲或亚洲的一个小国聘请；两国人民听到这个消息的时候是很满意的。
    奥列斯托夫指出：印度政府和巴基斯坦政府了解两国人民的许多要求，采取了直接进行协商而不用外国“仲裁人”、“调解人”和“观察员”的方法，这样才使在解决克什米尔问题方面取得第一次的成功成为可能。
    奥列斯托夫写道：克什米尔最近的局势表明：某些具有侵略性的外国势力，仍然没有放弃阻挠克什米尔问题和平解决并把克什米尔变成他们的战略基地的希望。例如，华盛顿的战略家们就正在寻找机会，以便使美国军队得以在联合国的旗帜下开进克什米尔。
    奥列斯托夫指出：由于外国的干涉，克什米尔纠纷僵持五年多不能解决，印度和巴基斯坦的人民，首先是克什米尔人民，是有理由对这一事实感到愤怒的。印度总理尼赫鲁三个月以前曾经公开声明：假如没有别的国家的干涉，克什米尔问题也许已经得到解决了。
    可是，和平的敌人的阴谋活动，受到了克什米尔人民自己的坚决反对。
    外国特务的工具、克什米尔总理阿布杜拉已经在八月九日被撤职并被逮捕了。
    克什米尔新政府不得不采取紧急的措施，制止那些严重地干涉克什米尔内部事务的外国特务们的活动。
    奥列斯托夫最后写道：印度和巴基斯坦两国总理所进行的商谈，已经指出了解决复杂的克什米尔问题的道路。为了和平的利益和克什米尔人民的利益，必须继续努力，以期和平地解决这个纠纷。
