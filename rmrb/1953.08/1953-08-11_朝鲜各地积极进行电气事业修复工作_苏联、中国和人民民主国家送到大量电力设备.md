Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th: All employees of the Korean electricity sector are enthusiastically responding to Marshal Kim Il-sung's call to "strengthen the democratic base and restore and develop the post-war people's economy," and are actively restoring the electrical equipment destroyed by the enemy.

The Korean electrical industry suffered severe damage from the American aggressors during the war. Twenty large and small power plants, including Sup'ung, and many transmission lines were continuously and barbarously bombed. Employees of the electricity sector were always engaged in heroic and tenacious active repairs. After the armistice, the repair and restoration work was rapidly further strengthened. In terms of line repair, restoration and construction teams composed of employees from power transmission and distribution departments in various places have now gone to the damaged locations to concentrate on repairs. Before August 10th, power supply will be restored to the central areas of cities and counties where power supply was interrupted during the war; before September 1st, restrictions on electricity consumption for some industrial sectors and private use can be lifted. Severely damaged lines will also be repaired in a short period of time. Among them, the main lines between Jochon and Sup'ung, and between Pyongyang and Changjin, with a total length of sixty kilometers, are expected to be completed by the end of this year. The members of the restoration and construction teams are also actively repairing the temporarily erected lines during the war under the slogan of "thoroughly eliminating power outages" to ensure the quality of power transmission. Employees of the electricity sector are also preparing for the new line construction project between Sup'ung and Kanggye.

The restoration of power plants and electrical equipment manufacturing factories in various places is also being accelerated. The restoration of the Changjin River, Pujon River, Hochon River, and Kumgangsan hydro-electric power plants, large and small, which had already begun during the war, is expected not only to be fully restored by the end of this year, but also to double the amount of electricity. After completing the restoration design work, many enterprises, such as the Gangseo Electrical Factory, immediately began restoration work actively and will soon be able to start manufacturing various electrical materials such as small transformers, wires, and light bulbs.

In order to assist the Korean people in quickly restoring the electrical industry, the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries have sent them a large amount of electrical equipment, with more than 500 types. This kind of assistance is playing a huge role in the restoration of the Korean electrical industry and has further strengthened the Korean people's confidence in restoring and building their motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 8th: In order to formulate specific restoration plans for enterprises after the armistice, the Korean Ministry of Heavy Industry has sent twenty investigation teams to various places to investigate in detail the extent of damage to important enterprises during the war. These investigation teams are composed of technicians from various bureaus of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and from key enterprises, as well as well-known scholars from various universities.

During the war, the Ministry of Heavy Industry had conducted investigations on the war damage suffered by its affiliated enterprises and had formulated a basic restoration plan for the second half of 1953 based on the wartime investigation materials. Before the post-war restoration plan was formulated, the employees of the Ministry of Heavy Industry's enterprises were actively carrying out restoration work according to the basic restoration plan for the second half of this year.

    朝鲜各地积极进行电气事业修复工作
    苏联、中国和人民民主国家送到大量电力设备
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜电力部门的全体员工，正在热烈地响应金日成元帅“一切为了加强民主基地，恢复和发展战后人民经济”的号召，积极地修复着被敌人破坏的电力设备。
    朝鲜电气事业在战争中曾遭到美国侵略者的严重破坏，水丰等二十个大小发电厂和许多送电线路，都不断遭到野蛮的轰炸。电力部门员工随时都在英勇顽强的积极抢修。停战以后，抢修和恢复工作迅速进一步加强。在线路修复方面，各地送电和配电部门员工组成的恢复建设队，现已分头前往被破坏的地点集中进行抢修。在八月十日以前，对战时中断送电的各市、郡中心地即可恢复电力供应；在九月一日以前，对一部分工业部门和私人用电的限制可以取消。遭受严重破坏的线路也将在短期中修复。其中，主要干线——赵村、水丰间和平壤、长津间被破坏的线路，共长六十公里，预计在今年年底以前可修复完成。恢复建设队的队员们并在“彻底消灭停电事故”的口号下，积极补修着在战时临时架设起来的线路，以保障送电的质量。电力部门的员工们并正在为水丰、江界间的新设线路工程进行着准备工作。
    各地的发电厂和电气器材制造工厂的修复工作也在加紧进行中。在战争期间即已开始进行修复的长津江、赴战江、虚川江、金刚山等大小水力发电厂，预计不仅在今年年底以前可以完全恢复，而且电量将比现在增加一倍。江西电气工厂等许多企业在修复设计工作完成之后，立即积极地开始了修复工作，不久就可开始制造小型变压器、电线、电灯泡等各种电业器材。
    苏联、中国及各人民民主国家为了协助朝鲜人民从速恢复电气事业，已给他们送来了大量电力设备，种类有五百多种。这种援助对于朝鲜电气事业的恢复正在起着巨大的作用，并已进一步加强了朝鲜人民恢复建设祖国的信心。
    【新华社平壤八日电】为了制订停战后企业的具体恢复计划，朝鲜重工业省已派出二十个调查小组前往各地，详细调查各重要企业在战争中被破坏的情形。这些调查小组都由重工业省各管理局和各重要企业的技术人员以及各大学的著名学者组成。
    重工业省在战争期间曾对所属各企业进行过关于受战争破坏情形的调查，并曾以战时的调查材料制订了一九五三年下半年的基本恢复计划，在战后恢复计划未制订之前，重工业省各企业的职工们都按照今年下半年的基本恢复计划在积极进行着恢复工作。
