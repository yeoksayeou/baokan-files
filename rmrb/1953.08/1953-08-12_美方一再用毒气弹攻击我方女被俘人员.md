Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 11th: Korean People's Army female prisoners of war who returned from the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp on the 9th accused the U.S. military of repeatedly attacking them with poison gas. They said that from the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement until August 8th, the U.S. side attacked them with poison gas twice and threatened them five times.

On July 27th, the day the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, they heard the news of the successful armistice negotiations and gathered in the open space of the barracks after dinner that day to sing in celebration. At this time, the U.S. military sent armed personnel, set up machine guns, surrounded the barracks, and threw tear gas and suffocating poison gas bombs, causing many people to faint from poisoning on the spot.

On July 29th, they celebrated the signing of the armistice agreement and wrote a poem praising peace. When the U.S. military saw it, they immediately brought gas injectors and poison gas grenades and forced them to stop reciting the poem praising peace.

On the evening of July 30th, female prisoners of war Li Fuzhu and Chunlu went to look for their children, who had been taken away and held in another place by the U.S. military. The U.S. military arrested the two mothers and used poison gas bombs to threaten all the female prisoners of war.

On August 1st, they sang to celebrate the departure of a group of sick and wounded prisoners of war who were about to be repatriated. The U.S. military also took out poison gas bombs to threaten them to stop singing.

On August 3rd, a group of Korean People's Army prisoners of war moved near their barracks to wait for repatriation. They waved and sang to welcome the comrades who were about to be repatriated. The U.S. military also threatened them with poison gas bombs.

On August 5th, they knew that they would soon be repatriated and prepared to hold a celebration. The U.S. military immediately brought gas injectors and poison gas grenades, threatening to use poison gas if they wanted to hold a meeting or sing.

On August 8th, while they were traveling by train from Busan to Munsan for repatriation, the U.S. military launched another poison gas attack on them, and seven female prisoners of war fainted from poisoning on the spot.

These returnees who suffered brutal persecution from the U.S. side are living in the No. 3 Hospital in Kaesong. The feet and legs of Li Shi, Xu Dashun, Xu Fushun and others were burned by poison gas bombs, covered with blisters of all sizes, and the wounds were swollen and painful, preventing them from sleeping all night. Jin Fushan was fainted by the poison gas, and has been in a coma since arriving at the hospital at noon on the 9th.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 10th: On August 9th, the U.S. military driver who was sending our female prisoners of war actually beat our female prisoners of war who were cheering for returning to the embrace of the motherland in our handover area.

At 9:23 a.m. that day, when the U.S. "No. 757523" repatriation truck arrived in our handover area, the female prisoners of war on the truck, who had suffered humiliation and bullying in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, excitedly cheered "Long live!" and shouted slogans, waving the national flag of the motherland and banners written with their own blood. The U.S. military driver brutally beat them because of this. Those who were beaten included our prisoners of war Li Fenghua, Li Aishan, and Pei Zhengshun. Our repatriation officers immediately stopped them upon discovery. Our members of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee have lodged an oral protest with the other party regarding this matter. The U.S. members stated that they would investigate the matter, and if it is found to be true, they will take necessary measures and prevent similar incidents from occurring.

After the female prisoners of war repatriated on the 9th arrived in our handover area, they also complained to the joint Red Cross team about the abuse and persecution they suffered from the U.S. military during the repatriation. According to their report, they left Koje Island at 7 p.m. on August 7th to Busan. They were locked in a dirty and smelly hold of a cargo ship like goods. The hold was hot and not ventilated, and many people had headaches and vomiting, but they did not receive treatment. The children had not eaten when they boarded the ship, and they did not receive food on the ship either. After they arrived in Busan at 8 a.m. the next day, when the joint Red Cross team was present, the U.S. personnel hypocritically gave the children some biscuits. However, after the team members left, not only did they still receive a small amount of moldy and rotten beans and rice, but they were also brutally abused and persecuted by the U.S. military. Because they sang and cheered for returning to the embrace of the motherland and waved the national flag, the U.S. military set up machine guns around them to threaten them. A U.S. colonel rushed into their midst several times with soldiers, attempting to seize their national flag, but were met with heroic resistance from our female prisoners of war. That afternoon, the U.S. military drove them into the train carriages and brutally threw poison gas bombs at them and sprayed tear gas powder, and seven people fainted from poisoning on the spot.

    美方一再用毒气弹攻击我方女被俘人员
    【新华社开城十一日电】九日从巨济岛战俘营中归来的朝鲜人民军女被俘人员控诉美军一再用毒气弹攻击她们。她们说，光是在朝鲜停战协定签字以后到八月八日，美方就用毒气弹向她们攻击两次，威胁过五次。
    七月二十七日朝鲜停战协定签字那天，她们听到停战谈判成功的消息，就在当天晚饭后聚集在营房空地上唱歌，表示庆祝。这时美军竟派来武装人员，架起机关枪，把营房包围起来，投掷催泪性和窒息性毒气弹，以致很多人当场中毒昏倒。
    七月二十九日，她们欢庆停战协定签字，写了一首歌颂和平的诗。美军看到了，马上拿来毒气喷射器和毒气手榴弹，强迫她们停止朗诵歌颂和平的诗。
    七月三十日晚上，女被俘人员李富珠和春绿因为自己的孩子被美军拉走关在另外的地方，她们去寻找，美军把两位母亲抓了回来，并又用毒气弹对着全体女被俘人员，威胁着要攻击她们。
    八月一日她们唱歌欢送一批即将遣返的病伤被俘人员出发，美军也拿出毒气弹来威胁她们停止唱歌。
    八月三日，有一批朝鲜人民军被俘人员移到她们营房附近等待遣返，她们对即将遣返的同志挥手唱歌表示欢迎，美军也用毒气弹威胁她们。
    八月五日，她们知道自己快要被遣返了，准备举行庆祝，美军马上携带毒气喷射器和毒气手榴弹来，威胁说她们如要开会或唱歌，就要用毒气对付。
    八月八日，她们从釜山乘火车到汶山遣返途中，美军竟又用毒气弹对她们进行了一次攻击，当场就有女被俘人员七人中毒昏倒。
    受到美方残暴迫害的这些归来人员，住在开城第三号病院。李实、徐大顺、许福顺等人的脚上、腿上被毒气弹烧伤，布满了大大小小的水泡，伤口膨胀作痛，一夜未得安眠。金福善被毒气薰倒，从九日中午来到医院后，一直在昏迷状态中。
    【新华社开城十日电】八月九日，遣送我方女被俘人员的美军司机，竟在我方交接区内殴打为重回祖国怀抱而欢呼的我方女被俘人员。
    当天上午九时二十三分，美方“七五七五二三号”遣送卡车到达我方交接区时，车上的在美方战俘营内受尽了凌辱和欺侮的我方女被俘人员，都激动地欢呼万岁和高喊口号，挥舞祖国国旗和用自己鲜血缮写的标语。美军司机竟因此残暴地殴打她们。被打的有我方被俘人员李凤化、李爱善、裴正顺等人。我方遣接军官发觉后当即予以制止。战俘遣返委员会我方委员已就此事向对方提出口头抗议。美方委员表示将对此事进行调查，如查明属实，将采取必要措施，并防止类此事件发生。
    九日遣返的我方女被俘人员到达我方交接区后，还向联合红十字会小组人员控诉了她们在遣返途中遭到美军部队虐待和迫害的事实。据她们报告，她们在八月七日下午七时离开巨济岛赴釜山。她们像货物一样，被关在一间又脏又臭的货船的船舱里。船舱内闷热而不通风，许多人都头痛呕吐，可是得不到治疗。孩子们在上船时还没有吃饭，在船上也得不到食物。第二天上午八时，她们到达釜山后，当联合红十字会小组人员在场时，美方人员假惺惺地发给孩子们一些饼干。但是，当小组人员走开后，她们不仅得到的仍然是少量的霉烂的豆子和糙米制成的饭，而且遭到美军部队的残酷虐待和迫害。因为她们为重回祖国怀抱而唱歌欢呼和挥舞国旗，美军部队就在四周架起机枪威胁她们，一个美军上校几次带着士兵冲进她们中间去，企图夺取她们的国旗，都遭到我方女被俘人员的英勇反抗。当天下午，美军又把她们赶进火车的车厢里，残暴地向她们投掷毒气弹，并喷射催泪性毒粉，当场有七个人中毒昏倒。
