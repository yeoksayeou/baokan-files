Southwest China has achieved great success in promoting ethnic regional autonomy in minority areas over the past year.

Governments at all levels in Southwest China attach great importance to the autonomous rights of ethnic minorities. Since 1950, they have begun to help local ethnic minorities establish autonomous regions in the Kaili Miao area of Guizhou, the Pingwu Tibetan area of Sichuan, and the Tibetan and Yi areas of Xikang. In 1951 and 1952, governments at all levels trained nearly 10,000 ethnic minority cadres, providing good conditions for promoting ethnic regional autonomy in minority areas. After the "Outline of the People's Republic of China on Ethnic Regional Autonomy" was promulgated in August last year, governments at all levels and Party committees at all levels sent cadres or work teams to various places to help ethnic minorities further promote regional autonomy. In the past year, the following autonomous regions at the prefectural level have been established in the region: the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region in Xikang Province, the Tibetan Autonomous Region in Sichuan Province, the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, and the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Region. Among them, Yunnan Province has implemented ethnic regional autonomy in minority areas with a population of 1.2 million in the past year alone. At present, some areas of the Yi, Dai, Lisu, Jingpo, Hui, Lahu, and Aini ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province have successively implemented regional autonomy. In areas where the Dai, Jingpo, Lahu, and Lisu have implemented regional autonomy, it has reached more than 60 percent of the total population of these ethnic groups living in concentrated communities.

Before and after the establishment of ethnic autonomous regions in various places, they have received specific guidance and assistance from the people's governments at higher levels. In September last year, the Guizhou Provincial People's Government sent a 150-member work team to help the Miao people in Lushan County establish the Lushan Miao Autonomous County. During the preparation period for the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region and the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, the Yunnan Provincial People's Government sent ethnic work teams to provide assistance.

The establishment of ethnic autonomous regions in various places has been agreed upon by leaders of various ethnic groups and established in accordance with the wishes of the people of all ethnic groups. These autonomous regions have undergone a long period of preparation before their establishment. The autonomous regions jointly established on the basis of two or more ethnic minority areas, such as the Huishui Buyi-Miao Autonomous County in Guizhou Province and the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, have been established after full consultation with leaders of various ethnic groups and representatives of the people of all ethnic groups.

When establishing ethnic autonomous regions, governments at all levels have paid attention to helping ethnic minorities with smaller populations enjoy the right to autonomy. Many ethnic minorities with smaller populations within ethnic autonomous regions have established autonomous regions separately according to local conditions. For example, the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region People's Government in Yunnan Province has helped the Aini people in its territory realize regional autonomy.

After the establishment of ethnic autonomous regions in various places, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous regions have enjoyed the right to ethnic equality, thus strengthening ethnic unity and promoting various construction works. The economic and cultural lives of the people of all ethnic groups have also been improved. The people of all ethnic groups in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province have united to produce this year and changed their past farming habits. The six newly built ditches in the original Cheli County alone are 20 li long, and more than 100 large and small ditches have been repaired, which is estimated to increase grain production by more than 1.4 million jin in the county. In Puteng, Mengwang, Mengzhe and other areas, many ethnic minorities living in mountainous areas have come down to the dams to produce together with the Dai people.

### 西南区推行民族区域自治工作有很大成绩

    西南区推行民族区域自治工作有很大成绩
    西南少数民族地区一年来推行民族区域自治工作，已有很大成绩。
    西南各级人民政府重视少数民族的自治权利。从一九五零年起，就开始在贵州凯里苗族地区、四川平武藏族地区和西康的藏族地区与彝族地区，帮助当地少数民族建立自治区。一九五一年和一九五二年内，各级人民政府培养了近万名的少数民族干部，为少数民族地区推行民族区域自治准备了良好条件。去年八月，“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”公布后，各级人民政府和中共各级党委会都派了干部或工作队，到各地帮助少数民族进一步推行区域自治。一年来，在全区建立相当于专区级的自治区有：西康省凉山彝族自治区、四川省藏族自治区、云南省西双版纳傣族自治区和德宏傣族景颇族自治区。其中云南省在最近一年来，即在一百二十万人口的少数民族地区实行了民族区域自治。现在云南全省已有彝族、傣族、傈僳族、景颇族、回族、拉祜族、爱尼族等少数民族的部分地区相继实行了区域自治，傣族、景颇族、拉祜族和傈僳族已实行区域自治的地区，达到这些民族聚居人口总数的百分之六十以上。
    各地民族自治区在成立前后，都得到上级人民政府的具体指导和帮助。贵州省人民政府在去年九月间曾派出一百五十人的工作队，帮助炉山县苗族人民建立了炉山县苗族自治区。云南省西双版纳傣族自治区和德宏傣族景颇族自治区，在筹备期间云南省人民政府就派出民族工作队前往帮助。
    各地民族自治区都取得各民族领袖人物的同意和按照各民族人民的志愿建立的。这些自治区在建立前都经过较长期的筹备。其中以两个或多个少数民族聚居区为基础联合建立的自治区，如贵州省惠水县布伊族苗族自治区、云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区，都经过各民族领袖人物和各族人民代表的充分协商后建立起来的。
    在建立民族自治区时，各级人民政府都注意帮助人口较少的少数民族能够享受自治权利。许多民族自治区内人口较少的民族，已依据当地情况分别建立了自治区。如云南省西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府就帮助境内爱尼族人民实现了区域自治。
    各地民族自治区建立后，自治区内各民族人民都享受到民族平等的权利，因此加强了民族团结，并推进了各项建设工作。各族人民的经济生活和文化生活也得到了改善。云南省西双版纳傣族自治区各族人民，今年团结生产，改变了过去的耕作习惯。仅原车里县今年兴修的六条水沟共长二十里，并修补了大小水沟一百多条，估计可使全县增产谷子一百四十多万斤；在普腾、勐旺、勐遮等坝子，已有许多住在山区的少数民族人民，下坝来和傣族人民共同生产了。（新华社）
