    The Central Ministry of Agriculture recently issued instructions requiring all regions to vigorously organize the masses to store winter grass and protect livestock to safely get through the winter.

    The instructions stated: In the past, due to the lack of fodder grass in agricultural areas during the winter, and the lack of a habit of cutting grass for the winter in pastoral areas, livestock lacked nutrition, their physique was weak, and they were unable to resist the invasion of disasters such as rain, frost, wind, storms, and diseases. As a result, large numbers of livestock often died in various regions in late winter and early spring. In the past few years, some regions have focused on carrying out the work of cutting grass to protect livestock and have achieved good results. For example, in Inner Mongolia, livestock doubled in five years due to leading the masses in carrying out "three cuttings and two constructions" (cutting grass, digging wells, killing wolves, building sheds, and building pens). Ningxia Province learned from the lesson of the large-scale death of sheep in 1951 and focused on cutting grass in 1952, reducing the number of sheep deaths to only 0.66% of the 1951 figure. Therefore, leading the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen to cut and dry wild grass and store winter feed has become the main key to ensuring the safe wintering of livestock.

    The instructions also stated: It is now early autumn, and wild grass is growing luxuriantly, making it the best season for cutting and drying green grass. Whether in agricultural or pastoral areas, we should seize the time to carry out the grass-cutting movement and store sufficient winter fodder grass. In agricultural areas, we can mobilize the masses to use the original habit of cutting grass for fertilizer, or combine it with weeding in the fields, remove weeds in the fields or by the roadside, select the green grass suitable for feeding livestock, dry it, store it, and reserve it as winter livestock feed. At the same time, during the autumn harvest, we should collect as much straw and vines as possible that can be used as feed and properly store them. Tree leaves and agricultural processing by-products should also be collected as much as possible as supplementary feed. In southern regions, we can also use idle winter fields to plant feed crops. In areas where wild grass is insufficient and large areas of mountains are being closed off for afforestation, according to the principle of close integration and common development of forestry and animal husbandry, for publicly owned forest land, we can consult with the local people's government and forestry authorities and, with their consent, organize and plan to harvest the wild grass in the closed areas, but we must strictly pay attention not to harm the seedlings. In pastoral areas, we should guide herdsmen to divide grass-cutting areas and grazing areas, reserve sufficient winter and spring camps, and organize grass cutting in a planned manner. The ownership of private grasslands should be respected, and no coercion should be applied. This year, areas affected by disasters should make preparations early and solve the problem of grass shortage in a planned way. If there is insufficient pasture grass in the local area and it is necessary to transfer pasture from neighboring areas, it must be negotiated through the representative meeting and obtain the consent of the local masses. In areas with coal, it is advocated to burn coal and save the straw of crops to be used as livestock feed. In order to improve grass-cutting efficiency and solve the difficulty of lacking labor, various regions can, based on the current work foundation, organize different forms of mutual aid organizations on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, cooperate in cutting grass, distribute grass according to labor, and store and use it by individuals. In areas where grass-cutting tools are insufficient, we should maintain close contact with supply and marketing cooperatives and organize supplies in a timely manner. Appropriate loan assistance should also be given to those who are unable to purchase them.

    The instructions pointed out: Storing winter grass and protecting livestock to safely get through the winter is a major issue related to the production of the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen. Pastoral areas should list the storage of winter grass as the central task of autumn production. Agricultural areas should also seize the time to carry out the work during the gaps in busy farming. All regions should, based on the actual local situation, vigorously organize the masses to store a large amount of fodder grass and prepare livestock for the winter. In addition, we should also advocate repairing pens and building sheds to create favorable conditions for ensuring the safe wintering of livestock. In mobilizing the masses to carry out grass-cutting work, we should use typical examples of local storage of winter grass reducing livestock deaths, combined with the inherent experience of the masses, to widely conduct propaganda and education, and pay attention to cultivating labor models and activists, and use their advanced experience to take the lead in demonstration, so that the masses can recognize the benefits of cutting and storing grass from their own personal experience, and consciously and voluntarily actively participate in the movement to store winter grass and protect livestock.

### 中央农业部指示各地贮备冬草保护牲畜

    中央农业部指示各地贮备冬草保护牲畜
    中央人民政府农业部最近发出指示，要求各地大力组织群众贮备冬草，保护牲畜安全过冬。
    指示说：过去由于农作区冬季缺乏饲草，畜牧区向无打草过冬习惯，以致牲畜营养不够，体质瘦弱，无力抵抗雨霜风暴与疾病等灾害的侵袭，每到冬末春初，各地牲畜常发生大量死亡现象。近数年中，部分地区已重点开展打草保畜工作，并获得良好效果。如内蒙由于领导群众开展三打二搭（打草、打井、打狼、搭棚、搭圈），五年内牲畜增加一倍。宁夏省接受了一九五一年大批死羊的教训，一九五二年抓紧打草，羊只死亡数字减少到仅为一九五一年的千分之六点六。因此，领导广大农民、牧民开展打晒野草，贮备越冬饲料，就成为保证牲畜安全过冬的主要关键。
    指示又说：目前已到初秋，野草生长繁茂，正是打晒青草的最好季节。无论农区牧区，均应抓紧时间，开展打草运动，贮备足够的冬季饲草。在农区，可发动群众利用原有打草积肥习惯，或结合田间除草工作，清除田内或路旁杂草，选其中宜于饲畜的青草，晒干贮藏，留作冬季牲畜饲料。同时在秋收时尽量收集可作饲料的秸秆藤蔓，妥为保存。树木落叶和农产加工副产物亦应尽量收集，作为补充饲料。南方地区更可利用冬季休闲的田地播种饲料作物。在野草不足而又有大片山地实行封山育林的地区，应根据林牧密切结合、共同发展的原则，对于公有林地，可商请当地人民政府和林业主管机关同意后，有组织有计划地收割封闭区内的野草，惟须严格注意不得伤害树苗。在牧区，应指导牧民划分打草地和放牧地，留出足够的冬春营地，有组织地进行打草。对私有草地应尊重其所有权，不得给以任何强制。今年发生灾害地区，尤应早作准备，有计划地解决缺草问题。如当地牧草不足，需要向邻近地区调剂草场时，必须经过代表会进行协商，取得当地群众的同意。有煤地区，提倡烧煤，省出庄稼秸秆，充作牲畜饲料。为提高打草效率，解决缺乏劳动力的困难，各地可根据现在工作基础，在自愿互利的原则下，组织不同形式的互助组织，合作打草，按劳分草，由个人保存使用。打草工具不足的地区，应与供销合作社密切联系，及时组织供应。对无力购买者，并应给以适当的贷款扶助。
    指示指出：存贮冬草，保护牲畜安全过冬是关系着广大农牧民生产的重大问题。牧区应将贮备冬草工作列为秋季生产的中心任务。农区亦应利用农忙空隙抓紧进行。各地均应根据当地实际情况，大力组织群众，大量贮存饲草，准备牲畜过冬。此外，还应提倡修圈搭棚，为保证牲畜安全过冬创造有利条件。在发动群众开展打草工作中，应以当地存贮冬草减少牲畜死亡的典型实例，结合群众固有的经验，广泛进行宣传教育，并注意培养劳动模范、积极分子，以其先进经验带头示范，务使群众从切身体验中认识打草贮草的利益，自觉自愿地积极地投入贮备冬草保护牲畜运动。
