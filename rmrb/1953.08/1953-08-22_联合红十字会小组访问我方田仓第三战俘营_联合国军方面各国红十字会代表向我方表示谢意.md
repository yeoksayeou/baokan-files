Xinhua News Agency, Bitong, August 21st: The joint Red Cross group visiting the POW camps on the Korean-Chinese side met with POW representatives at the Tiancang No. 3 POW Camp on the Yalu River on the morning of the 15th. That afternoon, they inspected the barracks and carefully examined the welfare facilities of an American POW company. On the 16th, representatives of the joint Red Cross group visited the branch hospital and company clinics of the No. 3 POW Camp and held a discussion.

During the meeting between the joint Red Cross group and the POW representatives on the morning of the 15th, representatives from various countries' Red Cross societies raised many questions, which were answered one by one by the POW representatives.

American Red Cross representative Scarborough asked: I naturally want to ask about your welfare situation. Is your clothing, food, and shelter sufficient?

American POW Bangert said: Yes, clothing, food, and shelter are sufficient.

Representatives from various countries raised many questions about the POWs' daily lives. American Red Cross representative Scarborough asked: Do you have a set time for getting up, eating, entertainment, and sleeping?

American POW Ausley said: We have a set timetable, which depends on the length of day and night. American POW Bangert said: Except for getting up, eating, and sleeping, the whole day is at our own disposal. We can sleep all day, and if we are happy, we can swim or do anything else.

Scarborough asked: Do you have to do any physical labor other than cleaning the barracks? American POW Cushing said: The labor we do is all for our own benefit, such as going to the POW camp headquarters half a mile away to collect our food, or carrying firewood needed to cook for us. American POW Seke said: We also build sports fields for ourselves, such as soccer fields, basketball courts, and volleyball courts.

British Red Cross representative Jerome asked: I would like to ask again to be clear, you do not do work other than for your own benefit, such as work on roads or in fields? The POW representatives said: No.

Canadian Red Cross representative Barton asked: Do you receive letters from home? How often do you receive them? American POW Sloan said: We often get letters from home, and mail comes once a week.

South Korean Red Cross representative asked: What makes you happiest, and what makes you most uncomfortable? American POW Seke said: Letters make us happy, and it is most painful when we don't receive letters. People's moods depend on the progress of the peace negotiations. Now the mood is very high.

Regarding food, Danish Red Cross representative Megerd and Canadian Red Cross representative Barton asked: Do the POWs like the food in the POW camp? Who decides the menu? American POW Ausley said: The menu is decided by everyone. We have a food committee, and the committee members often go to each squad to solicit opinions. When I was first captured, Chinese and Korean cooks cooked, but later, because the cooking methods were different, we asked to cook for ourselves, and this was allowed.

Many representatives raised questions about medical and health aspects. American Red Cross representative Scarborough asked: Does each company have a hospital to treat serious illnesses? American POW Clin said: If anyone in each company has a cold or similar illness, they are treated at the company clinic, and if the condition is serious, they are sent to Bitong General Hospital.

Korean Democratic People's Republic Red Cross representative Zhang Yi said: I am very happy to see that you are in good health. Are there regular physical examinations? American POW Ausley said: Yes, there are daily clinics, and doctors and nurses often check the health of the POWs.

Canadian Red Cross representative Barton asked: Is there X-ray examination for lung disease? American POW Seke replied: If anyone has symptoms such as a cough, he is immediately sent to Bitong for X-ray examination.

American Red Cross representative Sandy asked: Are there dental facilities here? American POW Bangert said: There is a dental clinic in Bitong, and a dentist comes to the POW camp regularly. He came about a month ago.

Danish Red Cross representative Kirketepp asked: Have there been any infectious diseases during your time in the POW camp? American POW Bangert said: I can say no. There have been a few cases of dysentery, which was because those people did not heed the Chinese's advice and drank raw water.

Jerome asked: Have there been any cases of malaria? American POW Bangert replied: Some people had malaria, but that was a recurrence of old illnesses. South Korean Red Cross representative asked: Was malaria treated? American POW Seke replied: There is quinine. Everyone is issued mosquito nets.

The South Korean Red Cross representative also asked: There may be parasites. What measures have been taken? American POW Bangert said: There is a sanitation team, and the rooms are disinfected regularly.

The POW representatives answered many questions from representatives of various countries' Red Cross societies regarding cultural, sports, and religious activities.

American Red Cross representative Scarborough asked: Does each company have a club? How long can you play there every day? American POW Bangert said: We have a club in each company, and people can go to play every day. Most of us here have been elected as club committee members.

The Chinese Red Cross representative expressed the hope of knowing about the POW sports meet. American POW Bangert said: We recently had a sports meet. We originally scheduled it for May, but it was postponed to June due to bad weather. American POW Seke added: This March, we had ice skating competitions, and we also have water polo competitions. Last summer, there were swimming competitions, and last November, we also held a sports meet in Bitong.

The Chinese Red Cross representative asked: What are the recreational programs in the POW camp? American POW Bangert replied: We have stage plays. Sometimes POWs volunteer to perform music at the radio station. We have movies to watch, and we often see performances by Chinese cultural troupes. We organize evening parties, play billiards, and have boxing performances. Almost all kinds of recreational activities are available.

The South Korean Red Cross representative asked: Have you learned any Chinese music or games since coming to the POW camp? American POW Bangert said: Some people have learned to play Chinese chess. There is Chinese music on the radio programs, and I don't know if anyone has learned it.

Canadian Red Cross representative Barton asked: Do you have any music records from your own country? American POW Bangert said: Yes. In addition, we have guitars and various musical instruments. Many people like to sing American folk songs. We have American, French, Hawaiian, and Spanish music records. We also have records from Copenhagen. The POW representatives listed many record names and said that, in addition, each company organizes a band to broadcast music.

Jerome asked: How is the book supply? American POW Bangert said: I used to manage the library. There are plenty of various books, novels, and pictorials in the library. We have novels such as "The Three Musketeers" and "A Tale of Two Cities" and works by Stevenson.

Scarborough asked: How are religious activities? American POW Bangert said: This is entirely voluntary for the POWs. The POW camp provides assistance, allows it to be carried out, and provides various necessary materials such as decorative paper. The problem is that there are no pastors, and only some companies have pastors. American POW Cushing added: They provide us with Bibles, candles, crosses, curtains, etc. American POW Ausley said: People of different religions can get all conveniences on their own religious holidays.

Danish representative Megerd raised the question: Does this POW camp have obvious markings to avoid being bombed? American POW Ausley said: Each company has a "POW" sign. American POW Yanda said: When planes come, the Chinese give us warnings so that we can hide.

At the end of the meeting, the South Korean Red Cross representative asked a series of questions. He asked: Have any of you published any statements calling for peace? Through what channels? To whom were they published? American POW Bangert said: Everyone here wants peace. You can easily see this in every POW's letters to his family and friends.

Finally, Jerome asked: In summary, do you think that the treatment you have received is in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention? The POW representatives said in unison: Yes. The POW representatives also said that they had all received gifts.

On the 16th, after visiting the branch hospital and company clinics of the No. 3 POW Camp, the joint Red Cross group held a discussion. Representatives of various countries' Red Cross societies on the UN side said at the meeting: The living supplies for the POW camp are very sufficient. The representatives said: We heard about the situation of the No. 1 POW Camp in the past, and this time we heard the report of the commander of the No. 3 POW Camp, and we participated in yesterday's POW representatives' meeting, and we know that you have done a lot of work for the POWs. They also said: We already know that there are no epidemics here.

The representatives of various countries' Red Cross societies on the UN side finally said: We feel from all aspects that you have made the greatest efforts for the health and medical work of the POWs, and the results are obvious. We are very satisfied and would like to express our gratitude to you.

    斯卡布鲁问：你们要做些除了清扫营房以外的体力劳动吗？美国战俘柯辛说：我们所做的劳动，都是为我们自己的好处，如到离此半英里外的战俘营总部去领我们的粮食，或者搬运为我们煮饭所需的柴火。美国战俘塞克说：我们也为自己修建运动场，如足球场、篮球场、排球场等。
    英国红十字会代表朱洛姆问：我想还要问问清楚，你们不做为你们自己的好处以外的工作，如在道路上或田地里的工作吗？战俘代表们说：不做。
    加拿大红十字会代表巴敦问道：你们得到家信吗？多少时候收到一次。美国战俘斯洛安说：我们常得家信，邮件每星期来一次。
    南朝鲜红十字会代表问：什么事使你们最快乐，什么事使你们最难受？美国战俘塞克说：信件使我们高兴，接不到信时最痛苦。人们情绪的高低随着和平谈判的进展而定。现在情绪很高。
    在食物方面，丹麦红十字会代表梅格尔德和加拿大红十字会代表巴敦问：战俘们是否喜欢战俘营的食物？菜单是由谁决定的？美国战俘奥斯利说：菜单是大家决定的，我们有伙食委员会，委员们经常到各班去征求意见，我刚被俘时，有中国和朝鲜厨子做饭，但后来因为做饭方法不同，我们请求自己做饭，这得到了允许。
    很多代表就医药卫生方面提出问题。美国红十字会代表斯卡布鲁问：是否每中队都有医院医治重病？美国战俘克林说：每个中队如有人患伤风或类似的病在中队门诊，病情严重的会被送往碧潼总医院。

    丹麦红十字会代表克基特普问：你们在战俘营期间，有没有发生过传染病？美国战俘班格特说：我可以说没有，曾有过少数痢疾，那是因为那些人没有接受中国人的劝告喝了生水的缘故。
    朱洛姆问：有没有得过疟疾的？美国战俘班格特回答：有些人生过疟疾，但那是旧病复发的。南朝鲜红十字会代表问：有没有给医治疟疾？美国战俘塞克答：有奎宁。每一个人都发有蚊帐。

    中国红十字会代表表示，希望知道战俘运动会的情况。美国战俘班格特说：我们最近曾有一次运动会。我们原定在五月举行，但因天气不好延至六月举行。美国战俘塞克补充说：今年三月我们有溜冰比赛，我们并有水球比赛。去年夏天有游泳比赛，去年十一月还到碧潼举行运动会。
    中国红十字会代表问：战俘营中的文娱节目是怎样的？美国战俘班格特答：我们有舞台剧。有的时候战俘们自告奋勇到广播台表演音乐。我们有电影看，并经常看到中国文工队的演出。我们组织晚会，打康乐球，还有拳击表演。几乎各种文娱活动都有。
    南朝鲜红十字会代表问：到战俘营后是否学会了中国音乐和游戏？美国战俘班格特说：有些人学会了下中国棋。广播节目中有中国音乐，我不知道有谁学会了没有。

    朱洛姆问：书籍供应怎样？美国战俘班格特说：我曾管过图书馆。图书馆中，各种书籍、小说、画报很充足。我们有“三剑客”、“双城记”等小说和斯蒂文森的著作。
    斯卡布鲁问：宗教活动怎样？美国战俘班格特说：这完全由战俘自己志愿，战俘营给以帮助，准许进行，并供给各种需要的物资如装饰用的纸等。问题在于没有牧师，有些中队才有牧师。美国战俘柯辛接着说：他们供给我们圣经、蜡烛、十字架、布幔等。美国战俘奥斯利说：信仰不同宗教的人在他们自己的宗教节日可以得到一切便利。
    丹麦代表梅格尔德提出问题说：本战俘营有无明显标志，以免被轰炸？美国战俘奥斯利说：每中队都有“战俘”标志。美国战俘杨达说：当有飞机来时，中国人发出警报使我们可以躲避。
    在接见会将结束时，南朝鲜红十字会代表提出一连串的问题。他问：你们中有任何人发表过任何要求和平的声明书吗？通过什么途径？向谁发表的？美国战俘班格特说：我们这里每一个人都要和平。你可以很容易地在每一个战俘给他家里和给朋友的信中看出这一点。
    最后，朱洛姆问道：总括起来说，你们觉得你们所受的待遇是符合日内瓦公约上规定的吗？战俘代表们同声说：是的。战俘代表们并说，他们都收到了馈赠品。
    十六日，联合红十字会小组在参观了第三战俘营分医院和中队门诊所后，举行了座谈会。联合国军方面的各国红十字会代表在会上说：对于战俘营的生活供给等都是很足够的。代表们说：过去听了第
    一战俘营的情况，这次又听到第三战俘营司令官的报告，参加了昨天的战俘代表会，知道你们为战俘作了很多工作。他们并说：我们已经知道这里没有流行病。
    联合国军方面的各国红十字会代表最后说：我们由各方面感觉到你们为了战俘的卫生医药工作尽了最大的努力，成绩很明显，我们感到很满意，特向你们表示感谢。
