The Central Geological Department's 321 Exploration Team
Promotes "One-Time Sand Injection Method," Drilling Efficiency Increases More Than Twofold

Since the beginning of this year, the Central Geological Department's 321 Exploration Team has been promoting the Soviet advanced experience – the "one-time sand injection method," and drilling efficiency has greatly improved.

The use of sand injection in drilling holes has a long history. This involves injecting cast iron steel grit (similar in size to shotgun pellets, about the size of millet grains) into the borehole and using the pressure of the steel drill bit to crush the steel grit, thereby grinding and breaking the rock. The old method was "multiple sand injection," with very little sand injected each time, only a few dozen grains (injecting more was feared to jam the drilling tools and cause accidents). This required re-injection after a short period of grinding, with each injection requiring a two to three-minute shutdown, which greatly reduced drilling efficiency. The Soviet advanced method involves injecting a large amount of the required steel grit into the borehole all at once, hence the name "one-time sand injection method."

Before promoting the "one-time sand injection method," the 321 Exploration Team conducted a period of ideological preparation. The vast majority of young technicians and workers expressed great enthusiasm for learning the "one-time sand injection method." However, the leading cadres underestimated conservative thinking, and in the early stages of experimenting with the "one-time sand injection method," they encountered many obstacles and the effect was not significant. As a result, some more technically skilled masters used various excuses to resist adopting this method. In light of these circumstances, the 321 Exploration Team vigorously supported the activists who actively promoted the "one-time sand injection method." Within a short period, they increased drilling efficiency by two to three times, setting an example for promoting the "one-time sand injection method" and educating those with conservative ideas with vivid facts. On the other hand, based on the Soviet "one-time sand injection method" documents and the summary of promoting this advanced experience in the Northeast and other regions, combined with the current situation of the 321 Exploration Team, they compiled detailed lecture notes and lectured again, expanding the study. Only then did they gradually eliminate some people's concerns and resistance, allowing the "one-time sand injection method" to be promoted smoothly.

The result of promoting the "one-time sand injection method" has significantly increased the rate of progress for the 321 Exploration Team. Especially when drilling through Grade 7 hard rock layers such as diorite and magnetite, in the past, one shift could only drill 0.8 meters, and even a good shift could only drill 1.2 to 1.3 meters. Now, it is generally possible to reach about 2.5 meters, increasing the efficiency of penetration by one to two times. Comrade Chen Ruoyu, the leader of the No. 7 machine crew, once set a new record of 3.2 meters in one shift. When No. 8 machine drilled through the Grade 7 skarn and mineralized diorite rock layers, it created a record of 0.65 meters per unit hour, exceeding the quota by 2.58 times, and in magnetite, it created a new record of 0.78 meters per unit hour, exceeding the quota by 3.11 times.

Promoting the "one-time sand injection method" has also greatly increased the core retrieval rate, and the cores are particularly complete, ensuring drilling quality. In the past, the core retrieval rate of the 321 Exploration Team was often as low as 40%. Each time, there would be as many as twenty or thirty pieces of core, each no more than 5 centimeters long, and the longest was no more than 0.3 meters. Since the implementation of the "one-time sand injection method," each core is mostly more than half a meter long, and the number of pieces retrieved at one time has been reduced to four to eight, with a very smooth and complete surface. The core retrieval rate has increased to over 90%. In effective mineral layers such as mineralized diorite, magnetite, and skarn, the core retrieval rate can be guaranteed to be around 90%, and in some cases can reach 100%. The increased core retrieval rate provides a strong guarantee for sampling, testing, and identification, thereby improving the accuracy of calculating reserves.

The "one-time sand injection method" involves injecting more steel grit, which increases the diameter of the borehole. As a result, it eliminates the most common occurrence of steel grit getting stuck between the hole wall and the core tube, causing a stuck drill, and also reduces the resistance on the sides of the drill tools, saving pipe materials and facilitating faster drilling. The spindle speed has increased from 140 revolutions per minute to 200 to 240 revolutions per minute.

In promoting the "one-time sand injection method," the 321 team also organized employees to find tricks and solve some new problems in the promotion of the "one-time sand injection method." For example, squad leader Zhu Shaoyun improved the sand injection funnel, speeding up the flow rate of steel grit and reducing the danger of steel grit jumping out and damaging the machine. Master Lu Huanzhang suggested using the pocket cloth used to package steel grit (which was previously discarded after wiping the machine) to make a "spindle scarf," which is wrapped around the spindle when injecting sand, preventing the problem of steel grit falling into the machine.

    中央地质部三二一勘探队
    推广“一次投砂法”钻进效率提高两倍多
    中央地质部三二一勘探队从今年初推广苏联先进经验——“一次投砂法”以来，钻进效率大大提高。
    在钻孔中采用投砂法由来已久。这就是将生铁浇制的钢砂（如猎枪所用的枪砂，大小和敉米粒差不多）投到钻孔里，利用钢钻头的压力，把钢砂辗碎，来研磨克取岩石。旧法是“多次投砂”，每次投的很少，不过几十粒（投多了怕卡住钻具，造成事故），研磨不了多久就要再投一些，每投一次要停钻二三十分钟，这样就大大降低了钻进的效率。苏联的先进方法，是把所需要的钢砂，大量的一次投到钻孔里去，所以叫做“一次投砂法”。
    在推广“一次投砂法”之前，三二一勘探队曾进行了一个时期的思想酝酿，绝大多数青年技工学工们对学习“一次投砂法”，表示了很高的热情。但领导干部对保守思想估计不足，试验“一次投砂法”的初期，又遇到不少障碍，效果不大，因而一些较有技术的师傅就以各种藉口来抗拒采用这种方法。根据这些情况，三二一勘探队一方面大力支持积极推广“一次投砂法”的积极分子，他们在很短期间内就使钻探效率提高了二倍到三倍，树立了推广“一次投砂法”的榜样，以生动的事实教育了有保守思想的人；另一方面根据苏联“一次投砂法”的文件以及东北等地区推广这一先进经验的总结，结合三二一勘探队当前情况，编写了详尽的讲义，再一次进行讲授，展开学习。这才逐步消除了一些人的顾虑和抗拒的情绪，使“一次投砂法”得以顺利推广。
    推广“一次投砂法”的结果，使三二一勘探队进尺率显著提高，特别是在钻探七级的闪长岩、磁铁矿等硬岩层时，以往一班只能钻进零点八公尺，好的也不过钻进一点二到一点三公尺。现在普遍可以达到二点五公尺左右，提高了进尺效率一倍到二倍。七号机班长陈若愚同志曾创一班进尺三点二公尺的新纪录，八号机钻穿七级斯卡隆及矿化闪长岩岩层时，创造单位小时进尺零点六五公尺的纪录，超过定额二点五八倍，磁铁矿中创造单位小时进尺零点七八公尺新纪录，超过定额三点一一倍。
    推广“一次投砂法”又大大提高了岩心采取率，且岩心特别完整，保证了钻探质量。过去，三二一勘探队岩心采取率常低到百分之四十，一次取出来的岩心要多到二三十块，每块长不过五公分左右，最长的也不到零点三公尺。自推行“一次投砂法”后，岩心每块长多在半公尺以上，一次取出来的块数减少到四块到八块，表面非常光滑完整，岩心采取率提高到百分之九十以上，在矿化闪长岩、磁铁矿、斯卡隆等有效矿层中岩心采取率可以保证百分之九十左右，个别可以达到百分之百。岩心采取率提高后，对选样、化验、鉴定都给以有力的保证，从而提高了计算埋藏量的精确度。
    “一次投砂法”钢砂投的多，钻孔直径加大，因而消灭了以往最容易发生的钢砂夹在孔壁与岩心管之间所造成的卡钻事故，并且减少了钻具侧面所受的阻力，节省了管材，也更便利了快速钻进。竖轴每分钟转数已从一百四十转提高到二百转至二百四十转。
    三二一队在推广“一次投砂法”中，又组织职工找窍门，解决了推广“一次投砂法”中的一些新的问题。如班长朱少云动手改进了投砂漏斗，加快了钢砂下流速度，减少了钢砂跳出来损坏机器的危险。吕焕章老师傅建议用包装钢砂的口袋布（以往揩机器后就丢掉了），作成“竖轴围巾”，投砂时把竖轴围起，防止了钢砂坠入机内的弊病。  （刘广志）
