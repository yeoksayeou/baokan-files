    (I) The Soviet Union's Major Efforts to Resolve the German Question
    The German question is one of the most pressing international issues at present. At this stage, when international tensions are beginning to ease somewhat due to the Korean armistice, seeking a peaceful resolution to the German question will make a significant contribution to further consolidating international peace and security.
    Recently, the Soviet government has made significant efforts to promote an early resolution of the German question. On August 4th, the Soviet government sent notes to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, proposing a meeting of the four foreign ministers to discuss ways to ease international tensions and restore German unification and conclude a peace treaty with Germany. On August 15th, the Soviet government sent further notes to the three Western governments, suggesting immediate practical measures to resolve the German question. These measures were: First, to convene a peace conference within six months to discuss a peace treaty with Germany, and to ensure that Germany is represented at all stages of the preparation of the treaty and at the peace conference; Second, to suggest that the parliaments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, with the broad participation of various democratic organizations, form an all-German provisional government, whose main task would be to prepare and hold free all-German elections, after which the German people would, without foreign interference, resolve the social and national structure of a democratic and peace-loving Germany themselves; Third, to alleviate Germany's financial and economic obligations arising from the consequences of the war. Subsequently, from August 20th to 22nd, the Soviet government and the delegation of the government of the German Democratic Republic held talks in Moscow and made important decisions to ensure a peaceful solution to the German question and to help the German people resolutely embark on the path of peaceful development.
    In its talks with the delegation of the government of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet government decided to implement measures in the German Democratic Republic to alleviate Germany's financial and economic obligations arising from the consequences of the war. At the same time, the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic governments reached agreements on strengthening and developing economic, cultural, scientific, and technological cooperation between the two countries. As a result of these decisions and agreements, the Soviet Union will cease collecting reparations from the German Democratic Republic, abolish German debts, transfer Soviet enterprises in Germany to the German Democratic Republic free of charge, further reduce occupation costs, cease collecting occupation costs owed by the German Democratic Republic since 1945, export goods worth 590 million rubles in excess to the German Democratic Republic, and provide the German Democratic Republic with loans of 485 million rubles. At a time when the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have shown no response to the proposal to alleviate Germany's financial and economic burden, these measures taken by the Soviet Union towards the German Democratic Republic fully demonstrate the Soviet Union's firm determination to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and to peacefully resolve the German question. At the same time, these measures are a great help to the further prosperity and development of the German Democratic Republic, thereby alleviating the consequences caused by the division of Germany and creating the necessary conditions for the restoration of Germany's peaceful unification.
    Germany has not yet been able to restore unification, which is entirely the result of the United States and West Germany's Adenauer group pursuing the division of Germany and the rearmament of West Germany. The Adenauer group does not hesitate to sell out the interests of the German nation, acting as a despicable accomplice and lackey of the United States, and completely tying its fate to plans to rebuild German militarism and prepare for a new war in Europe. Last May, the Adenauer group signed the so-called "Bonn Treaty" with the United States, the United Kingdom, and France; at the same time, it also signed the so-called "Paris Treaty" with five Western European countries. Both of these treaties are intended to rebuild Hitler's invading army as the backbone of the so-called "European Army." The "Bonn Treaty" also stipulates that the United States, the United Kingdom, and France will continue to occupy West Germany for fifty years. This will keep Germany permanently divided and unable to restore unification. Now, the Adenauer group is continuing to resist the demand for German unification and is colluding with the United States to accelerate the equipping of the West German army. If this plan is realized, West Germany will once again become a breeding ground for war in Europe, seriously threatening world peace and the survival of the German nation.
    In the past, the United States has consistently used the excuse of not having an all-German government to refuse to discuss and conclude a peace treaty with Germany. In its note to the Soviet Union on July 15th, the United States even repeated this cliché, attempting to reduce the German question to the issue of holding all-German elections in order to avoid discussing the fundamental issues of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and restoring German unification.
    However, the Soviet Union's peace policy powerfully shattered the United States' war conspiracy. Especially after the Soviet Union put forward practical measures to resolve the German question on August 15th, all these excuses and fabrications of the United States have been completely refuted.
    Now there is no reason why an agreement cannot be reached on the German question; the United States and its partners should immediately change their attitude of delaying the resolution of the German question and accept the Soviet Union's proposal to seek a peaceful resolution of the German question as soon as possible. Otherwise, it can only prove that they are fundamentally unwilling to resolve the German question and are determined to divide Germany and prepare for a new war in Europe.
    Of course, a very important factor in seeking a solution to the German question is the wishes and struggles of the German people themselves. As Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, pointed out: "The fate of Germany is in the hands of the German people." In the years since the war, two paths have become increasingly clear to the German people: one is the path of war and the division of Germany, and the other is the path of peace and national unification. From the historical lessons of Germany preparing for and launching two wars in half a century, which caused unprecedented disasters to the German nation, the German people have seen that the path of war is the path of national suicide for Germany. Therefore, they firmly oppose war, demand the peaceful unification of Germany, and demand that Germany be transformed into a democratic and peace-loving country. This desire of the German people has been expressed extremely strongly in the broad actions against the re-militarization of Germany and for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. This struggle is continuing to develop. Clear-headed German political leaders and outstanding members of the German people are fighting for the peaceful unification of Germany and for the establishment of a peace-loving and democratic Germany. The German Democratic Republic plays a significant role in this struggle and has increasingly become a strong fortress for all peace-loving and democratic forces in Germany. Peace-loving people of all countries have seen the development of a new, peaceful, and democratic Germany from the correct direction of the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, the Soviet Union's full support and assistance to the German Democratic Republic is also support and assistance for the sincere desire of the German people to restore national unification.
    World public opinion has been calling for easing international tensions since the Korean armistice. The German question has always been the root cause of tension in Europe, so the resolution of this question has become very urgent. The German people and the people of France, Britain, and the United States should seize the current opportunity and seek a reasonable solution to the German question on the basis of the Soviet proposal.

    （一）苏联谋求解决德国问题的重大努力
    德国问题是目前最急迫的国际问题之一。在国际紧张局势由于朝鲜停战而开始有一些缓和的现阶段，谋求德国问题的和平解决对于进一步巩固国际和平与安全将有巨大的贡献。
    最近，苏联政府为促进德国问题的早日解决作了重大的努力。八月四日，苏联政府照会美英法三国政府建议举行四国外长会议，讨论缓和国际紧张局势的办法及恢复德国统一和缔结对德和约的问题。八月十五日，苏联政府又照会西方三国政府，建议立即采取解决德国问题的实际措施。这些措施是：一，在六个月内召开和平会议讨论对德和约，并保证德国在准备和约的所有各阶段中及在和平会议上都有代表参加；二，建议德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国议会，在各民主组织的广泛参加下组成一个全德临时政府，这个政府的主要任务是准备并举行全德自由选举，然后德国人民将不受外国干涉，自己来解决一个民主的、爱好和平的德国的社会和国家结构问题；三，减轻德国由于战争的后果而负担的财政和经济义务。接着，从八月二十日到二十二日，苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府代表团在莫斯科进行了会谈，对保证德国问题得到和平解决、帮助德国人民坚决地走上和平发展的道路作出了重要的决定。
    苏联政府在和民主德国政府代表团的会谈中，决定将减轻德国由于战争的后果而负担的财政经济义务的措施在民主德国付之实施。同时，苏联与民主德国政府并在关于加强与发展两国的经济、文化、科学与技术合作的问题上取得了协议。由于这些决定和协议，苏联将停止自民主德国收取赔偿费，废除德国所欠的债务，无偿地移交在德国境内的苏联企业归民主德国所有，进一步减少占领费，停止自民主德国收取自一九四五年以来所积欠的占领费，超额输出给民主德国以五亿九千万卢布的货物，并给予民主德国以四亿八千五百万卢布的贷款。在美英法三国对减轻德国财政经济负担的建议尚毫无反应的情况下，苏联对民主德国所采取的这些措施，充分表现了苏联谋求缔结对德和约及和平解决德国问题的坚定决心。同时，这些措施对于民主德国的进一步繁荣发展又是一个巨大的帮助，从而减轻了由于德国的分裂局面所造成的后果，而为恢复德国的和平统一创造了必要的条件。
    德国至今还不能恢复统一，这完全是美国与西德的阿登纳集团奉行分裂德国和重新武装西德的结果。阿登纳集团不惜出卖德国民族利益，充当美国的可耻的帮凶和走狗，把它的命运完全系在重建德国军国主义和在欧洲准备新战争的计划上。阿登纳集团于去年五月与美英法三国签订了所谓“波恩条约”；同时，并与西欧五个国家签订了所谓“巴黎条约”。这两个条约都是为了把希特勒侵略军队重建起来，作为所谓“欧洲军”的骨干。“波恩条约”并规定美英法在五十年中将继续占领西德。这将使德国永远陷于分裂，而不能恢复统一。现在，阿登纳集团正继续抗拒德国统一的要求，并与美国勾结在一起，加速把西德军队装备起来。如果这个计划实现，西德将重新成为欧洲的战争温床，而严重地威胁着世界的和平和德国民族的生存。
    美国过去一直以所谓没有一个全德政府为藉口，而拒绝讨论并缔结对德和约。就在七月十五日对苏联的照会中，美国还曾重复这种滥调，企图把德国问题缩小为举行全德选举的问题，以避免讨论缔结对德和约与恢复德国统一的根本问题。
    但是，苏联的和平政策有力地击破了美国的战争阴谋。特别是在苏联八月十五日提出解决德国问题的实际措施的建议之后，美国的这一切藉口和谰言都已不攻自破了。
    现在对德问题已没有任何理由不能达成协议了；美国及其伙伴应该立即改变它们拖延解决德国问题的态度，并接受苏联的建议，以早日求得德国问题的和平解决。否则，就只能证明它们根本不愿意解决德国问题，而决心分裂德国，并在欧洲准备新的战争。
    当然，在谋求解决德国问题的努力中，很重要的一个因素是德国人民自己的愿望和斗争。正如苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志所指出的：“德国的命运掌握在德国人民手中。”战后的几年来，在德国人民的面前越来越清楚地摆着两条道路：一条是战争并使德国分裂的道路，一条是和平与全国统一的道路。德国人民从半世纪以来德国准备并发动两次战争而使德国民族遭受了空前浩劫的历史教训中，看到了战争的道路是德国民族自杀的道路。因而他们坚决反对战争，要求德国的和平统一，要求把德国变为一个爱好民主和平的国家。德国人民的这种愿望在反对德国重新军国主义化和争取早日缔结对德和约的广泛行动中，极其强烈地表现出来了。这个斗争并正在继续发展。头脑清醒的德国政治领袖和德国人民中的优秀分子正为德国的和平统一，为建立一个爱好和平民主的德国而奋斗。德意志民主共和国在这个斗争中起着重大的作用，并已日益成为全德国爱好和平民主力量的强大堡垒。各国爱好和平人民已由德意志民主共和国的正确方向看到了一个和平民主的新的德国的发展。因而，苏联对德意志民主共和国的全力支持和帮助，也就是针对德国人民要求恢复国家统一的真诚愿望的支持和帮助。
    世界舆论在朝鲜停战之后，纷纷要求缓和国际紧张局势。德国问题一直是欧洲紧张局势的根本原因，因而这个问题的解决就成为非常急迫的了。德国人民和法、英、美各国人民应该抓紧目前的时机，在苏联建议的基础上求得德国问题的合理解决。
