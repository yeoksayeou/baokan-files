The Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to solve the problems of lecturing and counseling cadres in the intermediate groups of Beijing municipal level agencies in their study of Chapter Nine of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", held a training class for intermediate theoretical instructors and counselors of "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" in early June.

This training class brought together 128 Party and Youth League member cadres from various departments, engaged in propaganda and education work and other tasks. Among them were nine at the division-chief level, fifty-eight at the section-chief level, and sixty-one general cadres; sixty-two with a university education, fifty-eight with a high school education, and eight with a junior high school education. During the study period, eighty-eight people were completely released from work, and forty people were released from work for three days a week. Those who were completely released from work generally read all the documents that the advanced group should study when learning Chapter Nine; in addition to reading the "Economics and Politics of the Proletarian Dictatorship Era" and the second part and conclusion of Stalin's "Summary Report on the Central Political Work at the 14th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)", which were required reading for those who were semi-released from work, most also read other documents stipulated in the central instructions. Finally, all the students listened to the summary report and Q&A session on the study of Chapter Nine by the Theoretical Education Department of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department.

The students had the following gains after studying Chapter Nine of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)":

I. They understood some basic laws of the transition period and some main experiences of the Soviet Union's national economic recovery period. This was specifically reflected in: (1) A few students in the past did not know there was such a thing as a "transition period" at all, and thought that they had immediately entered socialism after the October Revolution; some knew, but could not figure out where the transition period was transitioning from and to. After this study, students generally were able to explain the necessity of the transition period from the characteristics of the socialist revolution, and especially realized that the transformation of the small-peasant economy must go through a long period of arduous work. They also had a relatively clear understanding of the economic characteristics and class relations of the transition period.

(2) In the past, many students' understanding of the worker-peasant alliance was relatively simple. They only knew that there were many peasants, and the working class's alliance with the peasants would be strong, and without the alliance, there could be no revolution. Now they further recognize that the worker-peasant alliance is constantly developing and has new content. The worker-peasant alliance in the Soviet Union and China during the revolutionary war was mainly a military and political alliance, but in the period of economic construction, the worker-peasant alliance must be consolidated economically. Some students also understood the significance of the worker-peasant alliance from the duality of the peasants.

(3) In the past, most students' understanding of the importance of commerce and commercial work was insufficient. They only knew that the role of state-owned commerce was to stabilize prices. Now they have generally understood the enormous role of commerce in the Soviet Union's national economic recovery period and the importance of commodity exchange for connecting industrial and agricultural production and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. In the past, many comrades did not clearly understand the role of cooperatives in socialist construction, and some comrades even regarded cooperatives merely as institutions for doing business. Now they recognize the great significance of cooperatives in educating and organizing peasants and attracting them into socialist construction. In their studies, the students all related the Soviet Union's recovery period experience to China's problems. The students have a further understanding of the significance of some of our important measures in the recovery period (financial and economic unification, price stabilization, development of urban and rural trade, and the recent adjustment of the cotton-grain price ratio), especially a new understanding of the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance in our country after the land reform.

II. Deepened understanding of "learning from the Soviet Union." The students realized that we basically followed the Soviet Union's path during the national economic recovery period, and the basis for Chairman Mao's important instructions and many basic policies of our Party can be found in the theories of Lenin and Stalin and the experience of the Soviet Union. Therefore, they further realized the profound significance of Chairman Mao's call to "learn from the Soviet Union." In the past, a few comrades thought that "Marxism-Leninism is needed for revolution, but not necessarily for construction"; some one-sidedly emphasized that China's situation was special and did not know the universal significance of Soviet construction; and many comrades thought that learning from the Soviet Union during the construction period only meant learning their science and technology. These erroneous ideas have been corrected after this study.

III. There were also some inspirations in terms of ideological methods. Many students realized that Lenin and Stalin always formulated policies, proposed and solved theoretical problems, and creatively developed Marxism based on the development of practice; while the opposition could not see the development of practice, regarded theory as dogma, and distorted Marxism. On the necessity and essence of the New Economic Policy, the theory of building socialism in one country, and Lenin's different formulations of the nature of cooperatives, everyone particularly understood the principled difference between these two opposite attitudes.

IV. Many comrades began to increase their interest and confidence in studying theory. This study was the first relatively in-depth concentrated study for most students, and it was also learning theory through history, so everyone felt that theory was not as difficult to learn as they thought, and specifically realized the great significance of theory for guiding practice, overcoming the idea that "theoretical study does not solve problems" and "being afraid of reading big books." A cadre student from the court said that he initially thought that as long as he stood firm on his position, he could make revolution; later, he realized in his work that only by understanding the policies could he truly stand firm on his position; after this study, he specifically realized that it is impossible to truly understand policies without studying theory. Some comrades said that they understood the principle that only by studying theory can they "stand tall and see far."

The gains from this study are not solid or balanced enough. The reasons for this, in addition to the failure to concentrate in time after the start of school, the difficulty in reading some documents (such as On the Food Tax, On the Cooperative System), and the lack of explanation in some reports, which affected the learning effect, are mainly some problems in learning attitude and learning methods:

I. At the beginning, many students worried about not being able to complete the task of instructor, and even formed an ideological burden, but instead ignored the proposition that "first of all, they must learn well themselves."

II. Some students with a higher level of education were greedy and quick, and did not study the prescribed documents enough, pursued too many historical materials, and ignored the need to concentrate on studying problems in a realistic way. Some comrades with lower levels and difficulty in reading original works spent too much time reading introductory articles. For example, some comrades only read "Economics and Politics of the Proletarian Dictatorship Era" and "On the Food Tax" once, but read the introductory articles on "Study" two or three times, and even wrote their speaking outlines mainly relying on the introductory articles, resulting in unfamiliarity with the original works.

III. The training class correctly emphasized that studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" should not be linked to Chinese issues too early, and should only be linked after listening to reports on Chinese issues, based on this report, to prevent the phenomenon of not understanding the documents first and then rigidly linking them to Chinese reality; however, it did not promptly point out that even when studying the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" itself, it is also possible to appropriately link it to Chinese reality, which is also beneficial to understanding Soviet experience. As a result, some problems that could have been linked were not well linked. When studying Chapter Nine, there was no introduction of appropriate reference documents for linking to Chinese issues, which was a shortcoming, and some will be introduced in the future.

The Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department's leadership of this period of study also has some insights in learning methods and teaching guidance:

I. Regarding self-study: First of all, it should be emphasized that the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" is the basic document, and the Party History should also be frequently consulted when studying other documents in self-study. Secondly, the planning of self-study should be strengthened, and the order and progress of reading documents should be appropriately stipulated (but not too rigid), on the one hand to prevent random reading without order, and on the other hand to unify steps to facilitate the development of mutual assistance activities. Thirdly, organizing mutual assistance groups of three or five people is very beneficial for enlightening problems, solving small difficulties, deepening learning, and collectively preparing central speeches at discussion meetings during the self-study period. Furthermore, it is advocated to take notes. It is acceptable to record the main points of the original works, or to make outlines according to the unified central issues. Good notes and outlines can be exhibited to exchange experiences.

II. Regarding discussion: Discussion meetings with central speakers after full preparation are beneficial for helping everyone systematically understand the basic arguments of the documents. The shortcoming of general groups this time is that the discussion is not lively enough and the problems are not explored deeply enough. The ways to improve are:

(1) In addition to systematically explaining the problems in his own words, the central speaker should talk more about his own experiences and put forward some questions that are enlightening to everyone. Avoid reciting. (2) Everyone and every mutual assistance group must prepare fully in addition to focusing on key preparations. (3) Emphasize freedom of thought and bold doubts.

III. In order to strengthen specific learning guidance, the training class office can use the following methods: putting forward learning points and methods of reading Lenin and Stalin's original works; pointing out the self-study progress plan; collecting difficult questions and answering some questions as much as possible at any time by talking to group leaders individually; referring to the questions raised by everyone, drafting some reference questions to facilitate thinking and distributing them to each group, and arranging discussion topics; summarizing the study of a chapter, and answering the more important questions that have not been resolved after discussion.

    北京市一级机关中级组理论传授员、辅导员训练班的学习收获和经验
    中共北京市委宣传部为解决北京市一级机关中级组干部学习“联共（布）党史”第九章的讲课和辅导问题，曾在六月上旬举办了一期“联共（布）党史”中级理论传授员、辅导员训练班。
    这次训练班集中了各部门做宣教工作和其他工作的党、团员干部共一百二十八人。其中有处长级干部九人，科长级五十八人，一般干部六十一人；文化程度大学的六十二人，高中的五十八人，初中八人。学习期中有八十八人全部脱离工作，四十人每周脱离工作三天。他们先后听取了关于“联共（布）党史”第九章的讲解，另外还听了关于中国国民经济的恢复问题的报告。全脱离工作的学员一般都阅读了高级组在学第九章时应学习的全部文件；半脱离工作的学员除阅读训练班所规定的“无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治”和斯大林同志“在联共（布）第十四次代表大会上关于中央政治工作的总结报告”的第二部分和结论这两个必读文件外，大多数也阅读了中央指示中所规定的其他文件。最后全体学员还听取了市委宣传部理论教育处关于学习第九章的总结报告和问题解答。
    学员学习“联共（布）党史”第九章后有以下几点收获：
    一、懂得了过渡时期的一些基本规律和苏联国民经济恢复时期的一些主要经验，其具体表现：（一）少数学员过去根本不知道有“过渡时期”这回事，以为十月革命后马上就进到了社会主义；有的虽然知道，但是也弄不清过渡时期是从那里过渡到那里。经过这次学习，一般学员都能够从社会主义革命的特点来说明过渡时期的必要性，特别认识到了改造小农经济必须经过长时期的艰苦工作。对过渡时期的经济特点和阶级关系也有了比较明确的了解。
    （二）过去许多学员对工农联盟的了解是比较简单的。他们只知道农民人数多，工人阶级联合农民力量就大，不联合就不能革命。现在他们更认识到工农联盟是不断发展不断有新的内容的，苏联和中国在革命战争时期的工农联盟主要是军事政治的联盟，到经济建设时期则必须从经济上巩固工农联盟。有些学员还从农民的两重性体会到工农联盟的意义。
    （三）对商业和商业工作的重要性，过去多数学员是认识不足的。对国营商业的作用只知道是稳定物价。现在他们已经普遍懂得了商业在苏联国民经济恢复时期的巨大作用和商品交换对于联系工农业生产和巩固工农联盟的重要意义。许多同志过去对合作社在社会主义建设中的作用认识不清楚，有的同志甚至把合作社仅仅看作是做买卖的机关，现在则认识到了合作社对于教育和组织农民，吸引他们进入社会主义建设的重大意义。在学习中，学员们都把苏联恢复时期的经验来联系到中国问题。学员对我们在恢复时期的一些重要措施（财经统一，稳定物价，发展城乡贸易以及最近的调整棉粮比价等）的意义有了进一步的了解，尤其是对我国在土地改革以后工农联盟的基础的问题开始有了新的了解。
    二、加深了对“学习苏联”的认识。学员们体会到我们在国民经济恢复时期基本上还是沿着苏联的道路走过来的，毛主席的一些重要指示和我们党的许多基本政策都可以在列宁、斯大林的理论和苏联的经验中找到根据，因此进一步认识到毛主席“学习苏联”的号召的深刻意义。少数同志过去以为“革命用得着马克思列宁主义，建设就不一定用得着”；有的片面强调中国情况特殊，不知道苏联建设的普遍意义；还有不少同志以为建设时期学习苏联就只是学习他们的科学技术。这些错误想法，经过这次学习，都被纠正了。
    三、在思想方法方面也有所启发。许多学员体会到列宁、斯大林总是依据实践的发展来制定政策，提出并解决理论问题，创造性地发展了马克思主义；而反对派则看不见实践的发展，把理论当作教条，曲解马克思主义。在新经济政策的必要性和实质，一国建成社会主义的理论，列宁对于合作社性质的不同提法等问题上，大家特别体会到这两种相反态度的原则区别。
    四、许多同志，开始增加了学习理论的兴趣和信心。这次学习对于大多数学员都是头一次集中的比较深入的学习，而且又是通过历史来学习理论，因而使大家感觉到理论并不像大家所想的那样难学，而且具体地体会到理论对于指导实践的重大意义，克服了“理论学习不解决问题”、“怕看大书本”的思想。有一位法院的干部学员说，他最初以为只要站稳立场，就可以革命；后来在工作中才知道只有懂得政策才能真正站稳立场；经过这次学习，又具体地体会到不学理论是不可能真正懂得政策的。有的同志说，自己懂得了学了理论才能“站得高看得远”的道理。
    这次学习收获还是不够稳固和平衡的。其原因除了开学后未及时集中，有些文件（如论粮食税、论合作制）较难阅读，有些报告解释较少，对学习效果有影响外，主要是学习态度和学习方法上还有一些问题：
    一、开始时，许多学员担心完不成传授员的任务，甚至形成思想负担，反而忽视了“首先要自己学好”的主张。
    二、有些文化程度较高的学员贪多求快，对规定文件研究不够，过多地追求历史材料，忽视了实事求是地集中研究问题。有些水平较低、读原著感觉困难的同志用了过多的时间去看介绍文章。如有的同志对“无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治”、“论粮食税”只看一遍，而对“学习”上的介绍文章倒看了两、三遍，连写发言提纲也是主要依靠介绍文章，以致造成对原著不熟悉的现象。
    三、训练班曾正确地强调了学习“联共（布）党史”不要过早联系中国问题，只能在听了有关中国问题的报告后，再根据这个报告来联系，防止了这方面可能发生的不先弄懂文件，就去生硬地联系中国实际的现象；但却没有及时指出即使在学习“联共（布）党史”本文时，也可以适当地联系中国实际，这样做对领会苏联经验也有好处，以致有些本来可以联系的问题，也没有很好联系。在学习第九章时，没有介绍适当的作为联系中国问题的参考文件，这是一个缺点，今后准备介绍一些。
    市委宣传部领导这一段学习，在学习方法和教学辅导工作上也有所体会：
    一、关于自修：首先应强调以“联共（布）党史”为基本文件，在自修其他文件时也应经常翻阅党史。其次应加强自修的计划性，适当规定阅读文件的次序和进度（但不宜太死板），一方面防止没有次序地乱看，一方面统一步调便于展开互助活动。其次，组织三、五人一组的互助小组，在自修期间对启发问题，解决小的疑难，深入学习，集体准备讨论会上的中心发言是大有好处的。再者，提倡记笔记。记原著要点，或依照统一布置的中心问题作提纲均可。好的笔记和提纲可以展览，以便交流经验。
    二、关于讨论：经过充分准备的、有中心发言人的讨论会对于帮助大家系统地理解文件的基本论点是有好处的。这次一般小组的缺点是讨论不够活泼，问题发掘不深。改进的办法是：
    （一）中心发言人除用自己的话系统地说明问题外，应多讲些自己的体会，提出一些对大家有启发性的问题。切忌背诵。（二）每个人，每个互助小组除重点准备外，还必须全面准备。（三）强调自由思想，大胆怀疑。
    三、训练班办公室为加强具体的学习辅导工作，可以运用下列几种方式：提出学习要点和阅读列宁斯大林原著的方法；指出自修进度计划；汇集疑难问题，用与组长个别谈话的方法尽可能随时解答一些问题；参照大家所提的问题，拟些便于启发思考的参考问题分发各组，布置讨论题；总结一章的学习，和解答经过讨论仍未解决的较重要的问题。
