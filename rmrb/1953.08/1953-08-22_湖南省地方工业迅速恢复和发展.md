    Hunan Province's local industry has recovered and developed rapidly since liberation. By the end of last year, the number of factories and mines had increased by about thirty-five times compared to the time of liberation. The total output value of 326 factories and mines in local industry this year is about one-sixth of the total rice production in the province last year. 67.58% of the products of local industry are consumer goods for the people's needs, including various yarn counts and fabrics, processed foods such as milled rice, flour, and cooking oil, and stationery and paper. There are more than 100 power plants.
    All these local industries have undergone various political reforms, and have initially mobilized employees to carry out rationalization proposals, promoted advanced experiences, and improved production. Before liberation, each worker in a yarn factory could only watch 150 spindles. Now, they can generally watch more than 400 spindles, and the highest is 864 spindles. In the past, the average output per spindle per 20 hours for 20-count yarn was 0.65 pounds, but now the average output is already above 0.9 pounds. Coal mine workers have increased the coal recovery rate and pit prop recovery rate. Electrical workers have promoted advanced experiences such as rapid overhaul, the use of low-value coal, and the reduction of line losses. This year, the labor productivity of local industrial workers in Hunan Province is two and a half times that of 1950. This year's costs are about 5% lower than last year. The use of funds is much better than before. Taking the provincial industries as an example, if it cost 10,000 yuan to produce an item in 1950, it only costs more than 7,200 yuan this year. As a result, the prices of local industrial products have also decreased. The prices of eight major industrial products, such as 20-count cotton yarn and plain white cloth, were 3.4% lower in April of this year than in December 1950. Local industry processes agricultural products, opening up wider sales channels for agricultural products. However, in the past few years, in the development of local industry, due to insufficient estimates of the overall plan for national construction, production conditions such as raw materials and equipment, and market capacity, there has also been a lot of blindness. In order to develop local industry rationally, Hunan Province has carried out a series of rectification work in local industry. According to the production conditions and development prospects of each factory and mine, expand those that should be expanded, maintain those that should be maintained, shrink those that should be shrunk, merge those that should be merged, and close those that should be closed; in this way, help each factory clarify its business direction and give full play to its corporate effectiveness; also make it easier for the leading organs to manage. For example, although the products of leather factories are currently unsalable, people will demand more leather shoes and suitcases as their living standards improve; rice mills in small cities can process rice locally and supply local people with rice; although iron smelters and pot casters use backward production methods, they can meet the needs of the people and supplement the deficiencies of national large-scale industrial production. These enterprises have been retained. In addition, some factories and mines have strengthened personnel and production forces through mergers: for example, after the Lingling Victory Machinery Factory merged into the Hengyang Jianxiang Machinery Factory, the equipment and personnel of the Jianxiang Machinery Factory were enriched, turning the two factories that could only make small machinery and repair work and had weak production capacity into a factory with a larger production capacity that could manufacture machine tools. In the rectification, some factories and mines with poor production conditions and no development prospects were also closed. At present, some factories and mines are gradually implementing planned management on this basis. More than 30 factories and mines are solving special problems in operation and management, and then will gradually implement planned management.

    湖南省地方工业迅速恢复和发展
    湖南省的地方工业，解放以来恢复和发展都很快，到去年年底，厂矿单位已比刚解放时增加了约三十五倍。地方工业中三百二十六个厂矿今年的生产总值，约为去年全省稻谷生产总值的六分之一。地方工业生产的百分之六十七点五八，是供人民需要的生活资料，有各种纱支、布匹，有加工食品如机米、面粉、食油，有文具纸张等。有一百多个电厂。
    所有这些地方工业，都进行了各种政治改革，并且初步地发动职工开展合理化建议运动，推广了先进经验，改进了生产。纱厂在解放以前每人只能看一百五十个锭子，现在一般能看四百多个锭子，最高能看八百六十四个锭子；过去二十支纱每锭二十小时平均产量是零点六五磅，现在平均产量已经在零点九磅以上。煤矿工人提高了煤的回采率和坑木收回率，电气工人推广了快速检修、使用低值煤、减少线路损失……等先进经验，今年湖南省地方工业职工的劳动生产率为一九五○年的二倍半。今年的成本比去年降低约百分之五。资金运用的情况比以前好得多了。以省营工业来看，如果一九五○年生产一件东西，要用一万元资金，今年只要用七千二百多元就够了。因而地方工业产品的价格也降低了。二十支棉纱、白细布等八种主要工业品的价格，今年四月比一九五○年十二月降低了百分之三点四。地方工业替农业产品加工，替农业产品开辟了更宽阔的销路。但是，几年来，在发展地方工业中，由于对国家建设的整体计划，对原料、设备等生产条件和市场容量估计不足，也曾产生很大的盲目性。为了使地方工业合理地发展，湖南省曾在地方工业中进行了一系列的整顿工作。根据各厂矿的生产条件和发展前途，把该扩大的扩大，该维持的维持，该紧缩的紧缩，该合并的合并，该关闭的关闭；这样来帮助各厂明确经营方向，充分发挥企业效能；也使领导机关便于管理。例如：制革厂的产品现在虽然滞销，但人民生活水平提高后，就会要求供应更多的皮鞋、皮箱等，小城市的米厂能够就地加工，供应当地人民食米；炼铁厂和铸锅厂等虽然是用落后的方法生产，但它们却能满足人民需要和辅助国家大工业生产之不足，这些企业都被保留下来。另外，一些厂矿经过合并，加强了人员和生产力量：如零陵胜利机械厂合并到衡阳建湘机械厂以后，充实了建湘机械厂的设备和人员，使两个仅能做小型机械和修配工作、生产能力薄弱的工厂，成了一个能制造工作母机的生产能力较大的工厂。在整顿中也关闭了一些生产条件太差没有发展前途的厂矿。目前有些厂矿正在这一基础上，逐步实行计划管理。有三十多个厂矿正解决经营管理上的特殊问题，然后将陆续实行计划管理。
