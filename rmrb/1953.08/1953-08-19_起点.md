    Starting Point
    Feng Zhidan
    Yan Benwei, the young district committee secretary of the Second District of Liling County, Hunan Province, kept the People's Daily, which contained the newsletter "Gold Star Medal Winner - Ren Guodong," in his pocket, reading it whenever and wherever he could. "How have I been treating the Party's tasks?" "How should I change my approach and delve deeper?" he wondered silently. In March, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on agricultural production; the People's Daily published an editorial entitled "The Key to Leading Agricultural Production." Studying these documents, Yan Benwei felt as if a bright window had been opened in his heart. He began to see clearly the path of rural work shifting from land reform to production and construction.

    In the spring of 1952, the land reform work in Liling County was largely completed, and Yan Benwei had considered the future of rural work after land reform. He thought, "What's left of rural work? As for production, the farmers themselves know more, so there's no need to lead them. In the future, cadres can just be transferred to government offices to issue orders and instructions. The work will become simpler." Later, the county party committee called for continued leadership of farmers in production. The whole county launched rectification and study. He earnestly criticized his idea of "entering the city and sitting in the office"; however, he still could not deeply understand how to lead farmers in production. After a year of practice and the inspiration of the Central Committee's instructions this spring, he gradually understood.

    Cannot Rely Solely on "Mobilization Orders"
    He discovered that all his mistakes were due to his lack of knowledge of agricultural production (he was originally a student at a county middle school before joining the work) and his lack of understanding of the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy. Leadership meant holding meetings, almost all day and all night. Some of these meetings were necessary, but many were unnecessary and formalistic. The procedure for these meetings was often: report, discussion, challenge competition, adjournment. After the meeting, some work disappeared without a trace, and the masses could not be mobilized. Competitions and comparisons in rural areas were seemingly grand on the surface; after a burst of excitement, nothing remained. Because there were so many meetings in the district, township cadres simply left their bedding at the district office. When the county party committee arranged for the removal of pests, barnyard grass, and the accumulation and purchase of fertilizer, he arranged for it in the same way. Once, when he went to Gutangba Township, he first convened a meeting of township cadres to hold a "swearing-in" ceremony and issue a "mobilization order"; he made a red flag and a white flag, and put forward the slogan: "Lazy people don't catch insects, the white flag will be sent to their door"; he also mobilized primary school students from classrooms to parade and demonstrate, beating gongs and drums. During the land reform, he ran barefoot all over the villages, eating and living with the farmers, and the farmers said he was a good cadre; at this time, he was still working hard, but the farmers secretly said he was "bureaucratic." Last year, Liling County wanted to promote the sale of a large amount of chemical fertilizer, but the farmers thought the fertilizer was too expensive and was "foreign stuff," and they were unwilling to buy it; the district committee mobilized district and township cadres to carry poles and go from village to village to "persuade them to buy." One catty of ammonium sulfate was worth about two or three catties of rice; if twenty catties of ammonium sulfate were applied to one mu of land, the farmers' production costs would be greatly increased. The annual public grain burden of Hequan Township was about 160,000 catties of rice; last year, farmers spent more than 110,000 catties of rice to purchase chemical fertilizer. Obviously, it was not easy to increase production by such a large amount of grain. Yan Benwei had only heard that fertilizers contained three elements: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, but he did not fully understand their function. He vaguely promoted to the farmers: "Too much oil won't spoil the vegetables; too much fertilizer won't spoil the rice." The farmers listened to him and desperately applied nitrogen fertilizer (ammonium sulfate is also a nitrogen fertilizer) to the "high-yield demonstration fields," resulting in vigorous growth of rice seedlings, but reduced yields due to lodging. Some farmers increased production, but after calculating the accounts, the costs were too high. They said: "We have increased production for the government!" (The increased part was not enough to repay the fertilizer loans.) Some farmers called ammonium sulfate "sulfuric acid fear."

    Recalling the district committee's leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement last year, he said: "Our work only remained on our lips." He himself was not very clear about the three major principles of mutual aid groups, and he did not understand what the central link of the mutual aid and cooperation movement should be. Last spring, he went to the newly established Huangjiashi Mutual Aid Group for the first time. "What issues should I understand?"
    "Okay, let's have a meeting of all the group members!" So he convened a meeting of mutual aid group members and talked to them about production plans. He said: "Hey, don't be conservative, labor models in other places are guaranteeing 2,000 catties!" The mutual aid group finally set a production plan of "maximum yield of 2,000 catties per mu, average yield of 1,800 catties per mu" according to his wishes. Now even Yan Benwei himself finds it funny, "The empty cannon was fired too loudly!" Last year, the mutual aid groups in the whole district developed rapidly, with a great "boom." Shuikou Township was busy forming groups, and sixteen were formed overnight. Collective pig raising by mutual aid groups was an even more serious lesson in last year's production. The Chen Keyou Mutual Aid Group in the First District pioneered collective pig raising. The county held a representative meeting of mutual aid group leaders, and Chen Keyou gave a typical report, which swept across the county like a gust of wind. Yan Benwei thought this was a good thing and should be promoted. He bitterly persuaded the Li Chenggui Mutual Aid Group to "gather" the pigs together. For the sake of "piglet collectivization," the women of the mutual aid group quarreled; Li Chenggui's wife started cursing as soon as the mutual aid group held a meeting to discuss pig raising. After the Peng Xiantao Mutual Aid Group of Baofeng Township jointly raised pigs, no one cared, and the pigs did not fatten up. Later, four pigs stopped eating, and the group members broke up. Later, the piglets were divided up, and the four pigs were all raised again. A mutual aid group in Caoping lost its capital by raising pigs collectively, and the group members fought, tearing up the red flag of the mutual aid group. Three of the four mutual aid groups in Lizhou Township collapsed because of collective pig raising. Some mutual aid groups held countless meetings and had countless arguments over pig raising.

    Go Deep into Production, Go Deep into the Masses
    The new situation forced Yan Benwei to consider more issues. Starting last winter, the farmers had become tired of the busy meeting life, and they no longer enthusiastically attended meetings. The farmers demanded more production time. Many of the more than 100 township cadres in the whole district were in low spirits and asked to "drop their stalls" (most of these cadres were outstanding elements tested in land reform). Because there were too many meetings, Yi Jiachun (a farm laborer), the chairman of Liyu Township, spent three days transplanting a short field ridge during the spring ploughing last year. As soon as he picked up the shovel, someone shouted for him to attend a meeting. The masses called him a "new loafer"; his wife scolded him as a "short-lived ghost," and he swore to the district committee secretary that he would not be a cadre. Faced with these situations, Yan Benwei pondered: "Where is the guarantee for increased production in the whole district in 1953?" He led all district cadres to study the various instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on agricultural production. These instructions solved this knot for them.

    At that time, cadres from various departments were still doing their own thing. Farmers needed bean cake fertilizer, but the cooperative was closing its doors to "rectify the society" and not selling bean cake fertilizer. After correction, the cooperative sold more than 50,000 catties of bean cake fertilizer in five days, and the supply could not meet the demand. The cooperative built two lime kilns and supplied farmers with cheap lime (for use as indirect fertilizer) during the spring planting season. Forty district cadres were concentrated to go deep into the countryside to lead farmers in production. More than 100 main township cadres returned to production to lead production, and effectively reduced all unnecessary meetings. They no longer said they were unwilling to do it. Yi Jiachun did this, and the masses, his wife, and himself were all happy, and the work also improved; after the Party's training and education, he had honorably joined the Communist Party.

    The district committee initially changed its leadership methods. They reduced the number of meetings to an appropriate level, and only convened district committee meetings or other meetings at the decisive junctures of agricultural production to concentrate on solving problems. At ordinary times, members of the district committee went deep into key areas (a few townships in each area), frequently used the telephone to contact and exchange work information, and promptly discovered problems and guided the overall situation. In April, a cold wave struck, and spring rain continued, and Yan Benwei was worried about the problem of rotten seedlings day and night. All the members of the district committee maintained a high degree of vigilance. Pan Xianjin, a member of the district committee, called the district committee secretary from Xianshi Township and said: "Oil has already been found on the surface of a field, and the rotten seedling situation has developed." Yan Benwei went deep into the fields of the Huangjiashi Mutual Aid Group in Tianfu Township to consult with farmers on how to remedy the lack of seedlings. Huang Jiashi told him: "Seedlings should be stored in the nursery fields for a few more days, and fewer seedlings should be planted in each bunch when transplanting, and the problem of missing seedlings can be solved." The rotten seedling situation was generally checked in the whole district, and a forum of old farmers was convened; the district committee convened an emergency meeting and decided to promote the method of "promoting seedlings, protecting seedlings, supplementing with soaked seeds, storing more and planting less." The spring rain delayed the transplanting time by twelve days, but the district committee mobilized the farmers of the whole district to organize temporary mutual aid, and all the rice fields in the whole district were transplanted in four days, evenly, economically, and quickly, shortening the transplanting time by four days compared with previous years, and solving the problem of missing seedlings in the whole district. This was the first victorious battle on the agricultural production front in the district this year.

    Yan Benwei began to go to the masses to study production. He deeply realized that he must willingly be a primary school student of the masses and learn production techniques from the masses. He said: "Last year, the masses raised many problems in front of me, but I did not consider these problems. I often heard farmers say: Rotten seedling years bring good harvests. Thinking about it carefully, it makes sense. Whenever there are rotten seedlings, farmers must save seedlings, and plant fewer seedlings in each bunch, which is beneficial to the growth of rice. Last year, the farmers warned us that too much fertilizer would cause the rice to lodge, and lodging would only result in half the yield. But we blindly called on the farmers to desperately apply fertilizer. The rice seedlings did grow well; but once the rice lodged, the yield was greatly reduced. We must listen to the words of the masses, and study them more humbly." In the small pocket on the upper left corner of Yan Benwei's uniform, there was a pocket diary, which contained many vivid proverbs about production techniques from the masses. Now he basically understands the entire process and general knowledge of local agricultural production. It is possible to grasp the key issues in production in a timely manner and lead them. Immediately after transplanting, he paid attention to the drought resistance problem in the whole district. Ten of the eighteen townships in the whole district should pay attention to drought prevention, and organize water storage and water saving in a timely manner; some townships have sufficient water sources, but they should focus on resolving water disputes among farmers and organizing the "one hoe water control system." During the spring rain season, the sky was like wearing glasses, and the rain kept falling non-stop. At this time, the river water rose, and he was alert to the possible flood.

    Yan Benwei also began to pay attention to summarizing the production experience of the farmers. He studied with the farmers how to prevent rotten seedlings, how to select seeds with yellow mud water, and how to reduce production costs.

    Starting Point of Progress
    "Leading farmers to move forward from the current situation of the small-scale peasant economy." The Central Committee's instructions made Yan Benwei's mind much clearer than last year. He said: "The Central Committee's instructions have sobered us up from the victory; otherwise, there would be great chaos in promoting advanced experience this year." When promoting sparse sowing, he was focusing on key work in Hequan Township, and the Zou Yelei Mutual Aid Group first served as a demonstration. Zou Yelei sowed very sparsely according to the requirements of the County Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, with only 150 to 200 catties of seeds sown per mu of nursery field. After sowing, Yan Benwei invited the old farmers and labor models who came to observe the problem of sparse sowing. Their common opinion was: "Zou Yelei's seeds are indeed sown evenly; but they are sown too sparsely. Sparse seedlings grow slowly, but early rice needs to catch the season. As long as the grains don't touch each other, it will be fine." "Grains don't touch each other" came from the masses, and when it returned to the masses, it was smoothly accepted by the farmers. In this way, 250 to 300 catties were sown per mu, which was about half as sparse as the usual practice. The district committee found that the Xie Yongchi Mutual Aid Group in Wangfang Township forced group member Xie Yonggui to accept dense planting. The district committee immediately instructed all townships to generally check the phenomenon of forced orders in the promotion of advanced experience, and educated cadres and activists to steadily promote advanced technology.

    Rural work has undergone major changes from land reform to production and construction; the country's economic construction needs the strong support of agricultural production. When the reporter visited the Second District of Liling in May, the district committee of the Party was facing the "grain problem" - how to mobilize surplus grain households to sell grain to the state. These days, he has been thinking about this question all day long:
    "Grain." This made him feel even more that his pulse was beating together with the boiling heart of the working class in the Anshan Iron and Steel Factory; and beating together with the tense rhythm of the great motherland's five-year economic construction plan. How to increase the production of more grain, and to make more arduous struggles for the socialist future of the motherland and the people, has begun to become the center of Yan Benwei's life.

    The vast number of rural work cadres in the new districts are undergoing the transformation from land reform to production and construction. Yan Benwei is one of the thousands of ordinary rural work cadres, and he, like many cadres like him, is consciously accelerating the process of this transformation. This is a starting point, a very important starting point.

    湖南醴陵县第二区年轻的区委书记颜本伟，把登着“金星奖章获得者——任国栋”那篇通讯的人民日报塞在口袋里，随时随地读着它。“我是怎样对待党的任务的？”“我应该怎么转过来，钻下去呢？”他默默地想着。三月，中共中央发出了关于农业生产的指示；人民日报发表了“领导农业生产的关键所在”的社论。颜本伟学习了这些文件，心窝里像打开了一扇明净的窗户一样豁亮起来。他开始看清了农村工作由土地改革转向生产建设的道路。
    一九五二年春，醴陵县土地改革工作大部结束，颜本伟曾思考过土地改革后农村工作的前途。他想：“农村工作还剩下什么呢？生产吗，农民自己懂得更多，用不到再去领导。今后干部都调到机关里发命令、下指示就够了。工作会变得更简单的。”后来，县委号召要继续领导农民进行生产。全县又展开了整风学习。他认真地批判了自己“进城市，坐机关”的想法；然而仍是不能深刻地体会到到底怎么样领导农民进行生产。经过一年的实践和今春中央指示的启发，他才逐渐地明白了。
    不能只靠“动员令”
    他发现他的全部过错都是由于不懂得农业生产的知识（他参加工作前原是一个县立中学的学生）和不懂得小农经济的特点。领导就是开会，几乎整天整夜地开会。其中有的是必要的会，也有许多是不必要的、形式主义的会。这些会的程序常常是：报告、讨论、挑战竞赛、散会。会散了，有的工作竟无影无踪，群众发动不起来。农村中搞评比竞赛，表面上轰轰烈烈；一阵热闹之后，什么都没有了。区上的会多，乡干部索性把铺盖留在区公所。县委布置了除虫、除稗和积肥、购肥工作，他也照样地往下布置。有一次他到古塘坝乡首先召开乡干部会举行“宣誓”，发布“动员令”；制一面红旗，一面白旗，提出口号说：“懒人不捉虫，白旗子送上门”；又把小学生从课堂里调出来游行示威，鸣锣打鼓。土地改革的时候他赤着脚在村子里到处跑，和农民同吃同住，农民都说他是个好干部；这时他依然是那样艰苦地工作着，农民却背地里说他是“官僚主义”。去年醴陵县要推销大量化学肥料，农民嫌肥料价太贵，又是“洋东西”，不愿买；区委动员区乡干部挑着担子挨村挨户地去“劝购”。一斤硫酸錏约值二、三斤稻谷；一亩田如果下二十斤硫酸錏，就大大提高了农民的生产成本。河泉乡全年的公粮负担约为十六万斤稻谷；而去年农民购买化学肥料就支出了十一万多斤稻谷。要增产这样多的粮食显然不是很简单的事。颜本伟只听说过肥料中有氮、磷、钾三种要素，但他并不完全清楚它们的作用。他向农民们笼统地宣传“油多不坏菜；肥多不坏禾”。农民们听他的话，在“增产示范田”上拼命下氮素肥料（硫酸錏也是一种氮肥），结果禾苗长得很盛，但因倒禾而减产了。有的农民虽然增产了，可是算算账，成本太高。他们说：“我们给政府增了产啦！”（增产的部分还不够还肥料贷款）有的农民把硫酸錏说成“硫酸怕”。
    回忆去年区委对互助合作运动的领导，他说：“我们的工作只是停留在嘴巴上。”他自己对互助组的三大原则也不很清楚，更不懂得互助合作运动应该抓住什么中心环节。去年春天，他第一次到新成立的黄家实互助组工作。“应该了解些什么问题呢？”
    “好吧，组员们都来开个会吧！”他就召开了互助组员会议，和他们谈论起生产计划来了。他说：“嗳，不要保守啊，别的地方劳动模范们都在保证两千斤咧！”这个互助组最后按照他的愿望订了个“最高产量每亩二千斤，平均产量每亩一千八百斤”的生产计划。现在连颜本伟自己也感到好笑，“空炮放得太响了！”去年全区的互助组发展得很快，“轰”的劲头很大。水口乡闹编组，一夜编了十六个。互助组集体养猪更是去年生产中的一个严重教训。第一区的陈可友互助组首创集体养猪，县里召开互助组长代表会，陈可友做典型报告，一阵风吹遍全县。颜本伟认为这是件好事情，应该提倡。他苦苦地劝说李呈桂互助组也把猪“集拢来”。为了“猪仔集体化”，互助组的婆娘们都吵起来；李呈桂的老婆一见互助组开会讨论养猪就骂开了。保丰乡彭先桃互助组合伙喂猪以后，大家都不关心，猪养不肥。以后有四只猪不吃东西了，组员们闹散伙。后来把猪仔分了家，四只猪又都被养活了。草坪有个互助组集体养猪赔了老本，组员们打起架来，撕破了互助组的红旗子。李洲乡四个互助组因为集体养猪垮了三个。有些互助组为了养猪不知开了多少次会，发生过多少次的争吵。
    深入到生产中去，深入到群众中去
    新的情况迫使颜本伟去考虑更多的问题。从去年冬天开始，农民对忙碌的会议生活已经感到厌倦，他们已不再踊跃地到会了。农民要求更多的生产时间。全区一百多个乡干部中有许多人情绪低落，要求“丢摊子”（这些干部大多是土地改革中经过考验的优秀分子）。因为开会多，鲤鱼乡乡主席易家春（雇农）去年春耕时一条短短的田埂铲了三天，刚要拿起铲子，又有人喊去开会了。群众说他是“新二流子”；老婆骂他是“短命鬼”，他向区委书记发誓不当干部了。面临这些情况，颜本伟苦思着：“一九五三年全区增产的保证在那里呢？”他领导全体区干部学习了中共中央关于农业生产的各项指示。这些指示给他们解开了这个圪?。
    当时，各部门的干部还在自搞一套。农民需要枯饼，而合作社却在闭门“整社”，不卖枯饼。经纠正后，五天内合作社就销出五万多斤枯饼，供不应求。合作社办了两个石灰窑，春播期间廉价供应农民石灰（作间接肥料用）。四十个区干部被集中起来，深入乡村，领导农民生产。一百多名乡的主要干部重新回到生产中去，以生产领导生产，切实减缩一切不必要的会议。他们不再说不愿意干了。易家春这样做了，群众、老婆、自己皆大欢喜，工作也有起色了；经过党的培养和教育，他已经光荣地加入了共产党。
    区委初步转变了领导方法。他们把会议减少到适当的程度，仅仅在农业生产的决定性的关节上，召开区委会议或其它会议，集中解决问题。平时区委委员们分片（一片几个乡）深入重点，经常用电话联系和交流工作情况，及时地发现问题，指导全面。四月间，寒流袭来，春雨连绵，颜本伟日夜耽心着烂秧问题。全体区委委员对这保持了高度的警惕。区委委员潘先金从仙石乡打电话给区委书记说：“已经发现一丘田水面起油，烂秧情况已有发展。”颜本伟在天符乡黄家实互助组那里深入田间向农民们请教补救缺秧的办法。黄家实告诉他说：“秧苗在秧田里多蓄几天，插秧时每蔸再少插几根，缺秧问题可以解决。”全区普遍检查了烂秧情况，并召开了老农座谈会；区委会召开紧急会议，决定推行“催秧、保秧，补浸种谷，多蓄少插”的方法。春雨使全区的插秧时间延迟了十二天，但是区委会发动了全区农民组织临时互助，在四天内全区稻田就全部插上了秧苗，插得又匀、又省、又快，插秧时间比往年缩短了四天，并且解决了全区的缺秧问题。这是今年这个区在农业生产战线上的第一次胜利的战斗。
    颜本伟开始到群众中去钻研生产。他深刻地体会到：必须甘当群众的小学生，向群众学习生产技术。他说：“去年有许多问题，群众已提到我的面前，但是我并没有考虑这些问题。我常听农民说：烂秧年好收成，细想起来，是有道理的。每逢烂秧，农民就一定节省秧苗，每蔸少插，这样对稻子的成长是有利的。去年，农民曾经警告过我们说，肥太多禾必倒，禾倒只能收一半。而我们却盲目号召农民拚命下肥料。稻苗长得倒是好看；但是禾一倒，产量就受到很大的损失。群众的话不能不听，而且要更虚心地加以研究。”在颜本伟的制服的左上角的小口袋里，放着一本袖珍日记本，里面记着许多群众中关于生产技术的生动的谚语。现在他基本上已经了解了当地农业生产的全部过程和普通知识。有了及时地抓住生产中的环节问题进行领导的可能。紧接着插秧以后，他就注意到全区的抗旱问题了。全区十八个乡，其中十个乡要注意防旱，及时组织蓄水、省水；一部分乡水源是充足的，但要着重解决农民中的水利纠纷，整理“一把锄头放水制”。春雨时节，天像穿了眼一样，雨不停地下着，没有一刻休息的时刻。这时，河水涨起来了，他又警惕着可能到来的水患。
    颜本伟也开始注意总结农民中的生产经验了。他和农民们研究怎样防止烂秧，怎样用黄泥水选种，怎样减低生产成本。
    前进的起点
    “从小农经济现状出发”领导农民前进。中央的指示使颜本伟的头脑比去年清醒多了。他说：“中央指示使我们被胜利冲昏了的头脑清醒过来；不然今年推广先进经验就会出大乱子。”推广稀播时，他正在河泉乡进行重点工作，首先由邹业倈互助组作示范。邹业倈按照县农林局的要求播得很稀，一亩秧田只播一百五十斤到二百斤种谷，播种后，颜本伟邀集前来观摩的老农民和劳动模范们座谈稀播问题。他们共同的意见是：“邹业倈的种谷的确播得匀称；但是播得太稀了。稀秧长得慢，可是早稻要赶季节。只要做到谷不碰谷就要得了。”“谷不碰谷”是从群众中来的，再到群众中去时，就顺利地为农民所接受。这样，一亩田播种二百五十斤到三百斤，较惯例约稀播了一半。区委在王坊乡发现谢永驰互助组强迫组员谢永贵接受密植，区委会立即指示各乡普遍检查了推广先进经验中的强迫命令现象，教育干部和积极分子稳步地推广先进技术。
    农村工作从土地改革到生产建设已经发生了重大变化；祖国的经济建设需要农业生产的强大支援。当记者五月间到醴陵二区访问时，党的区委员会正面临着“粮食问题”——怎样动员余粮户把粮食卖给国家。这几天，他整日价都在思考这个问题：
    “粮食”。这使他更加感到自己的脉搏和鞍山钢铁工厂的工人阶级的沸腾着的心脏跳动在一起了；和伟大祖国五年经济建设计划的紧张的节奏跳动在一起了。如何增产更多的粮食，为祖国、为人民的社会主义前途而作更艰巨的斗争，已开始成为颜本伟的生活中心了。
    广大新区的农村工作干部正在经历着从土地改革到生产建设的转变。颜本伟是千千万万普通的农村工作干部中的一员，他和许多和他一样的干部，正在自觉地加速这个转变的进程。这是一个起点，一个十分重要的起点。
