    Statement of Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, on the Issue of the Political Conference

    The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement has opened the way for convening a political conference to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. Now that the United Nations General Assembly is discussing the issue of the political conference, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China deems it necessary to authorize me to make the following statement on the issue of the political conference:

    I. In order to ensure the harmonious conduct of the political conference, so as to establish a model for peaceful consultation and resolution of disputes in international affairs, the political conference should take the form of a round-table conference, that is, a form of joint consultation by both sides of the Korean armistice with the participation of other relevant countries, rather than the form of separate negotiations between the two sides of the Korean armistice. However, any resolution of the conference must be agreed upon unanimously by both sides of the Korean armistice in order to be valid.

    II. The scope of authority of the political conference should, in accordance with Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, first negotiate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, including the United Nations forces and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and then discuss other issues.

    III. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the proposal made by Mr. Vyshinsky, Head of the Soviet Government Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, on August 18, 1953, regarding the composition of the political conference is in accordance with the above principles, and we express our support. The Central People's Government also believes that any country that participated in the war in Korea as part of the United Nations forces may be considered as a party to the armistice to participate in the conference.

    IV. It should be pointed out that the United Nations General Assembly's discussion on the issue of the political conference has actually refused to invite representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate, which is unreasonable. Therefore, in order to facilitate the smooth convening of the political conference, the United Nations General Assembly has a responsibility to notify the governments of China and Korea of all proposals and suggestions related to the political conference at any time. The Central People's Government will consider any recommendation of the United Nations General Assembly that conforms to the aforementioned principles in this statement as a basis for holding the political conference.

    Beijing, August 24, 1953

    我中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来
    关于政治会议问题的声明
    朝鲜停战协定的签订，打开了召开政治会议以谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。现在，联合国大会正在进行关于政治会议问题的讨论，中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为有必要授权本人对于政治会议问题发表声明如下：
    一、为了使政治会议能够和谐进行，以便在国际事务中给和平协商解决争端建立典范，政治会议应采取圆桌会议的形式，即朝鲜停战双方在其他有关国家参加之下共同协商的形式，而不采取朝鲜停战双方单独谈判的形式。但会议的任何决议，必须得到朝鲜停战双方的一致同意，才能成立。
    二、政治会议的职权范围，应根据朝鲜停战协定第六十款的规定，先行协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，包括联合国军及中国人民志愿军在内，及和平解决朝鲜问题，然后再讨论其他问题。
    三、中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，苏联政府出席联合国大会代表团团长维辛斯基先生一九五三年八月十八日在联合国大会政治委员会上所提的关于政治会议的成员的提案是符合于上述原则的，我们表示支持。中央人民政府并认为，凡以军队参加联合国军在朝鲜进行战争的国家，可被考虑作为停战的一方参加会议。
    四、应该指出，联合国大会关于政治会议问题的讨论，竟拒绝邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加，这是不合理的。因此，为了促成政治会议的顺利召开，联合国大会有责任将一切有关政治会议问题的各项提案和建议随时通知中朝两国政府。联合国大会的任何建议，如果符合于本声明中前述的各项原则，中央人民政府将予考虑作为举行政治会议的基础。
    一九五三年八月二十四日于北京
