Fengcheng County Department Store in Liaodong Province, after mobilizing all employees to discuss the commodity circulation plan for the third and fourth quarters, continued to discuss and formulate a commodity reserve quota plan for the third quarter, further laying a good foundation for strengthening planned management.

Correctly formulating a commodity reserve quota plan can ensure timely and accurate commodity supply and can reasonably use funds. Before discussing the commodity reserve quota plan, the company first organized all employees to study the Soviet experience in formulating commodity reserve plans, and conducted research in light of the company's current actual work situation. However, because determining the commodity reserve quota was a new task, many ideological obstacles were encountered at the beginning of the discussion, and there was a general lack of confidence, believing that "determining the reserve quota plan is good, but our level is low, it's going to be tough!" and "Formulating a reserve quota plan is also a waste, the goods that are lacking can't come in, and the goods that aren't lacking come!" Based on these ideological situations, the leadership focused on explaining the purpose and significance of formulating a reserve quota plan, and used examples to illustrate the bad consequences of capital backlog and the insufficient supply of certain commodities in the past due to the lack of reserve planning. After this education, 80% of the employees had a correct understanding of formulating a commodity reserve quota plan. On this basis, ten professional groups were divided according to the fifteen kinds of commodities to be discussed, and those who were familiar with the business and commodities were designated as group leaders. Before the discussion, the groups studied the calculation methods, and then concentrated their efforts on discussing and determining their own commodity reserve plans based on the size of the Fengcheng County Department Store's commodity turnover, the distribution of the commodity network, the complexity of the commodities, and transportation and supply conditions. They determined how many days it would take to replenish a certain commodity, and how much the minimum reserve should be. The minimum reserve is the minimum amount of backup commodities that are often stored to ensure uninterrupted supply. The minimum reserve plus the replenishment amount for each period is the maximum reserve. The sum of the minimum and maximum reserves divided by two equals the average reserve. For example, the wholesale department for shirts and trousers has a sales volume of 1,250 dozens in the third quarter. According to the transportation and supply conditions of the wholesale station and the return procedures, as well as the shirt and trousers processing situation, it was determined that replenishment would be carried out every fifteen days. Based on the complexity of the varieties, the minimum reserve was determined to be twelve days (that is, to guarantee twelve days of supply). According to the sales volume of 450 dozens in July, the minimum reserve of twelve days should be 180 dozens. Replenishment is done every fifteen days, with fifteen dozens sold every day, so 225 dozens need to be replenished each time. Adding the minimum reserve, the maximum reserve is 405 dozens, and the average reserve is 292 and a half dozens.

Through the discussion and formulation of the commodity reserve quota plan by all employees, the accuracy of the commodity circulation plan has been further improved. For example, when the professional group discussed the towel reserve quota, they once again made a detailed calculation and studied the changing trends of people's needs. It was found that the towel plan of the Tongliaobao branch was more than 100 dozens less than the actual need, while the towel plan of the first store was more than 100 dozens more, and they were all corrected in time. Through the discussion and formulation of the commodity reserve quota plan, all employees have learned the method of formulating the commodity reserve quota, and they have a clear idea of how much they should store and how much they should sell for the commodities they operate.

### 凤城百货公司职工  讨论制订商品储备定额计划

    凤城百货公司职工
    讨论制订商品储备定额计划
    辽东省凤城县百货公司在发动全体职工讨论第三、四季度商品流转计划以后，继续讨论制订了第三季度商品储备定额计划，进一步为加强计划管理打下了良好基础。
    正确地制订商品储备定额计划可以保证商品供应及时、准确，并能合理使用资金。该公司在讨论商品储备定额计划之前，首先组织全体职工学习了苏联制订商品储备计划的经验，结合该公司目前实际工作情况，进行了研究。但由于确定商品储备定额是一项新的工作，开始讨论时遇到了许多思想障碍，普遍缺乏信心，认为“确定储备定额计划好是好，就是咱们水平低，够呛！”“制订储备定额计划也是白费，缺的货进不来，不缺的货倒来了！”领导上根据这些思想情况，着重讲解了制订储备定额计划的目的和意义，并以实例说明过去由于储备没有计划，造成资金积压和某些商品供不应求的恶果。这样教育后，使百分之八十的职工对于制订商品储备定额计划有了正确认识。在这个基础上，按准备讨论的十五种商品，划分了十个专业小组，指定对业务和商品熟悉的人当组长。小组在讨论之前，学习了计算方法，然后，集中力量根据凤城县百货公司商品流转额的大小、商品网分布情况、商品简繁程度、运输及供应等条件，讨论确定自己经营的商品储备计划，确定某种商品需要多少天进一次货，最低储备量需要多少。最低储备量就是为了保证不间断地供应而经常保存起码数量的后备商品。最低储备量加上每个时期的进货量就是最高储备量。最低和最高储备量加在一起被二除就等于平均储备量。比如衬衣衬裤批发部第三季度销售量为一千二百五十打，根据运输和批发站的供应条件及往返手续，以及衬衣衬裤加工情况等，研究确定十五天进货一次，又根据品种简繁程度等，确定最低储备量是十二天（即保证十二天的供应）。根据七月份销售量为四百五十打，十二天的最低储备量就应是一百八十打。十五天进一次货，每天销十五打，每次就需要进货二百二十五打，加上最低储备量，则最高储备量就为四百零五打，而平均储备量为二百九十二打半。
    通过全体职工讨论制订商品储备定额计划，进一步提高了商品流转计划的准确性。如专业组在讨论毛巾储备定额时，又进行一次算细账和研究人民需要的变化趋势，发现通辽堡分店的毛巾计划比实际需要数少一百多打，而第一门市部计划的毛巾却多了一百多打，都及时纠正过来了。通过讨论制订商品储备定额计划，使全体职工学会了制订商品储备定额的方法，对自己经营的商品，应该存多少、卖多少，心里都有了底。
