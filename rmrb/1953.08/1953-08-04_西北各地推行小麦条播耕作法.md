Northwest China is promoting the wheat strip planting method.

The work of changing from wheat broadcasting to strip planting in the Northwest region began in 1951. According to statistics from various places and materials from key inspections this spring, more than 70 percent of spring wheat in Ningxia has been changed to strip planting; in Xinjiang, in the key areas and townships of Hami, Heshuo, Yanqi, and Ruoqiang counties where strip planting was promoted last year, more than 80 percent of the cultivated land has been changed to strip planting; in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, strip-planted wheat accounts for more than 60 percent of all wheat fields. In addition, Wuwei in Gansu Province and Minhe, Huzhu, Xunhua, and Hualong counties in Qinghai Province have also successively promoted the work of changing from broadcasting to strip planting. With the expansion of strip planting areas, the number of promoted drills (farm tools for strip planting) is also increasing rapidly. According to incomplete statistics, Qinghai Province has promoted 892 drills from 1951 to this spring; the Turpan area of Xinjiang Province has promoted 3,000 this year.

When the above-mentioned areas began to promote the change from broadcasting to strip planting, the masses of farmers had ideological concerns. However, after seeing the benefits of strip planting from the facts, they changed their original skeptical attitude and took active action. In the Qitai County area of Xinjiang, broadcasting has always been practiced. When strip planting was promoted, the farmers were afraid of the labor, the trouble, and that the planting would be too sparse, resulting in less grain. In 1952, local farmer Yang Fu used a drill to plant six mu of wheat, which yielded 520 jin per mu, while the broadcast wheat fields at the same time yielded only 220 jin per mu, a difference of more than double. Drill planting can also save 30 percent of seeds and 20 percent of irrigation water per mu compared to broadcasting. Under the demonstration of this fact, local farmers began to realize the benefits of changing to strip planting. When Ningxia Province began to promote strip planting, the masses were afraid that the row spacing of strip planting would be too wide, resulting in less grain. After seeing the benefits of strip planting in 1952, they gradually expanded the area of strip planting. Farmers in Jinji Township, Tianshui County, Gansu Province, have experimented and found that drill planting can save one-tenth of the seeds, the seedlings emerge neatly, and it saves labor. On the point of saving labor, they cited an example: broadcasting requires two animals and can only plant two mu in half a day, while with a drill, one animal can plant five mu in the same time. At the same time, it is not convenient to weed broadcast wheat fields. Weeding five mu of land requires seven or eight man-days, while strip-planted wheat fields can be weeded with a small hoe, and five mu of land requires at most three or four man-days.

Although the above-mentioned areas have mostly adopted the method of typical demonstrations to promote this work, some areas have neglected publicity and education in the specific implementation, and even forced promotion. In addition, some areas also have some shortcomings in the transmission of technology (drill planting technology) and the supply of drills and other supporting tools. These must be corrected and overcome in future work. (Wei)

Editor's note: The Northwest region's promotion of changing wheat broadcasting to wheat strip planting is a major technical improvement in farming methods. However, when promoting this work, we should adhere to the method of typical demonstrations so that farmers can truly see the benefits of strip planting and then gradually promote it; at the same time, we should appropriately promote narrow-row uniform dense planting of wheat according to the local farmers' habit of dense planting.

### 西北各地推行小麦条播耕作法

    西北各地推行小麦条播耕作法
    西北地区推行小麦改撒播为条播的工作，是从一九五一年开始的。根据今春各地汇报和重点检查的材料统计，宁夏春麦已有百分之七十以上改用条播；新疆去年重点推行条播的哈密、和硕、焉耆、婼羌等县的部分区乡，今年已有百分之八十的耕地改用条播；陕西关中一带，条播的小麦已占所有麦地的百分之六十以上。此外甘肃省的武威和青海省的民和、互助、循化、化隆等县也先后推行了改撒播为条播的工作。随着条播面积的扩大，耧（条播的农具）的推广数目也在迅速增加。据不完全统计，青海省从一九五一年到今年春季，已推广耧八百九十二架；新疆省迪化专区今年已推广了三千架。
    上述地区在开始推行改撒播为条播工作时，农民群众是有思想顾虑的。但当他们从事实中看到条播的好处后，就转变了原有的怀疑态度，积极行动起来。新疆奇台县一带，一向实行撒播，推行条播时，农民们怕费工，怕麻烦，怕种的太稀，少打粮食。一九五二年当地农民杨福用耧种了六亩麦，结果每亩打了五百二十斤，而在同时期撒播的麦地，每亩只收二百二十斤，相差一倍以上。耧播比撒播每亩还可以节省百分之三十的种籽和百分之二十的灌溉用水。当地农民在这一事实示范下，开始认识到了改条播的好处。宁夏省在开始推行条播时，群众怕条播行距太宽，少打粮食。一九五二年看到条播的好处后，就逐渐扩大条播的面积。甘肃省天水县金集乡的农民已试验出：耧种可省种籽十分之一，出苗整齐，省工。在省工一点上他们举例说：撒播用两条牲口，半天只能种二亩，用耧的话，一条牲口同样时间可种到五亩。同时，撒播的麦田拔草也不方便，五亩地的草，就需七、八个人工，耧种的麦田可以用小锄，五亩地顶多用上三、四个工。
    上述各地推行这一工作虽然多采用了典型示范的方法，但是部分地区在具体进行中忽视了宣传教育工作，甚至有强迫推行的现象。此外，有的地区在传授技术（耧播技术）和供应耧及其他配合工具等方面，也存在有若干缺点。这些都须在今后工作中加以纠正和克服。（伟）
    编者按：西北地区推行改小麦撒播为小麦条播的耕作法，这是一种技术上的重大改进。但在推行这一工作时，应该坚持采用典型示范的方法，使农民真正看到条播的好处，然后逐步推广；同时应根据当地农民的密植习惯，适当推行小麦窄行均匀密植。
