(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 8th) The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) held a meeting on the 6th, inviting representatives from the Korean-Chinese side and the U.S. side to attend, to solicit opinions from both sides on some issues and requests related to the work of the NNSC and the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams.

    Major General Li Sang-cho, the chief member of our side of the Military Armistice Commission, attended the meeting. General Li Sang-cho, in the spirit of the Korean-Chinese side consistently abiding by the agreement and respecting neutral countries, gave clear and affirmative answers to all the questions.

    Colonel Troeh represented the U.S. side at the meeting. He answered some questions, but either refused to answer some questions or replied vaguely with "no comment."

    Regarding the issue of guaranteeing the safety of neutral nations personnel, General Li Sang-cho solemnly stated that, under the overall policy of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers consistently abiding by the agreement and respecting neutral countries, the safety of all personnel of the NNSC working in our area will not be a problem. Our side bears full responsibility for their safety and is prepared to take all necessary measures. If any saboteurs infiltrate our area attempting to endanger their safety, our side will take decisive military action to stop them.

    Colonel Troeh only stated that the U.S. side would take protection, escort, and other security measures along the way, at specific areas of ports, and at residences; the specific arrangements will depend on the circumstances.

    Regarding the request from the neutral nations personnel to carry cameras to take documentary photos necessary for the performance of their duties, and the issue of members of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams bringing their own radios to contact their national commissioners, General Li Sang-cho agreed that neutral nations personnel could take documentary photos necessary for their tasks, in compliance with local regulations, and guaranteed that the determined wavelengths of their self-provided radios would not be interfered with. Colonel Troeh of the U.S. side believed that the documentary photos needed by the teams should be taken by official military photographers equipped by the United Nations Command. He opposed the commissioners and team members of each neutral nation providing their own radios, saying: if the NNSC deems it necessary, it can provide a wavelength, but it must be shared by the four countries.

    General Li Sang-cho agreed to the relevant provisions proposed by the NNSC that each commissioner has the right to grant neutral nations personnel full transit convenience from Panmunjom to transport supplementary supplies to their own national personnel in each team once or twice a month, according to the Armistice Agreement; has the right to personally or designate personnel to go to each specific rear port to inspect the work of the teams and their own national personnel; and has the right to recall the national personnel in the teams to headquarters for reporting.

    The U.S. representative claimed that the supplementary supplies must be transported to the port by the United Nations Command. If the trucks of the neutral nations carrying supplies themselves can be loaded on U.S. trains or planes, the U.S. side can agree to the self-transportation by trucks. The U.S. representative did not agree that the commissioners of the NNSC could send people to inspect the work of their own national personnel in the teams and recall the national personnel in the teams.

    General Li Sang-cho agreed that the personnel of the NNSC have the full right to carry self-defense weapons, and if they decide to carry self-defense weapons in our area, it will not reduce the Korean-Chinese side's full responsibility for guaranteeing their safety. Colonel Troeh refused to answer this question, only saying: The United Nations Command has noted it and has no comment.

    Before the end of the meeting, Czechoslovakian Commissioner General Blahut, who chaired the meeting on the 6th, pointed out that some issues had not been resolved and would be discussed by the NNSC before consulting with representatives from each side.

    中立国监察委员会邀请双方代表举行会议
    我方明确答复中立国所提问题
    由于美方含混其词若干问题尚未解决
   【新华社开城八日电】中立国监察委员会六日举行会议，邀请朝中方面与美方的代表出席，就与中立国监察委员会及中立国视察小组工作有关的一些问题和要求，征询双方的意见。
    军事停战委员会我方首席委员李相朝中将出席了会议。李相朝将军本着朝中方面一贯遵守协议和尊重中立国家的精神，对各项问题都作了明确和肯定的答复。
    特罗埃上校代表美方出席会议，他答复了几个问题，但对一些问题或者是予以拒绝，或者是含混其词地答以“没有评论”。
    关于中立国人员要求保障安全的问题，李相朝将军郑重表示：在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军一贯遵守协议和尊重中立国家的总的政策之下，在我方地区内工作的中立国监察委员会的所有人员的安全，是不会有问题的。我方对他们的安全负完全责任，并准备采取一切必要的措施。假使有任何破坏分子潜入我方地区企图危害他们的安全，我方将采取断然的军事行动予以制止。
    特罗埃上校仅仅表示，美方将在沿途、各口岸特定范围及居住地点采取保护、护送及其他安全措施；至于如何具体安排，将视情况而定。
    对于中立国人员要求携带照相机以便拍摄为执行其任务所必需的记录性照片，以及中立国视察小组组员自备电台与本国委员联系的问题，李相朝将军同意中立国人员可以在符合当地规则情况下，摄取为任务所必需的记录性照片，并保证他们自备电台的确定波长不受干扰。美方的特罗埃上校认为小组所需的记录性照片，应由联合国军配备官方军事摄影人员拍摄。他反对各中立国委员及小组组员自备电台，他说：如果中立国监察委员会认为有必要时，可供给一个波长，但必须由四国共用。
    李相朝将军同意中立国监察委员会所提出的各委员有权根据停战协定给予中立国人员以充分通行便利的有关规定，自板门店每月输送一两次补充物资给各小组中的本国人员；有权亲自或指派人员前往各特定后方口岸，检查小组及其本国人员的工作；以及召回小组中的本国人员到总部报告。
    美方代表则声称补充物资须由联合国军运到口岸，如中立国自行运送物资的卡车可以装在美方的火车或飞机上，美方可以同意用卡车自运。美方代表不同意中立国监察委员会各委员可以派人检查小组中本国人员的工作及召回小组中本国人员。
    李相朝将军同意中立国监察委员会人员完全有权携带自卫武器，如他们决定在我方地区携带自卫武器，也并不因此减轻朝中方面保障他们安全的全部责任。特罗埃上校对这一问题拒绝回答，他仅说：联合国军方面注意到了，没有评论。
    在会议结束前，担任六日会议主席的捷克斯洛伐克委员布莱希中将指出，有若干问题尚未解决，将在中立国监察委员会讨论后再与各方代表洽商。
