Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, August 25th: Anshan held a representative assembly from August 22nd to 23rd to continue the mechanization and automation movement. The assembly summarized the achievements and experiences of the city in carrying out the mechanization and automation movement, and made specific arrangements for continuing this movement in the future.

More than 400 representatives from factories and enterprises in Anshan participated in the assembly. Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, also attended to provide guidance. In addition, more than 200 representatives from major administrative regions and industrial cities across the country, jointly organized by the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau, and the preparatory committee of the China Metal and Smelting Workers' Union, also participated in the assembly. These representatives included model workers, management cadres, technicians, and trade union cadres.

After summarizing the achievements and experiences of Anshan in carrying out the mechanization and automation movement, the assembly heard typical experience introductions from six technicians, workers, and factory representatives who had achieved significant success in the mechanization and automation movement. At the meeting, 270 million yuan and certificates were awarded to more than 700 workers and technicians who had made significant achievements in carrying out the mechanization and automation movement. Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, also spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the extremely valuable achievements already made by Anshan Iron and Steel Company in carrying out the mechanization movement not only directly promote the rapid development of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the rapid advancement of the national construction cause, but also greatly increase our confidence in completing the glorious and great construction cause. Lai Ruoyu called on everyone to continue to move forward on the road of mechanization and continue to achieve new successes.

The Anshan Continuing Mechanization and Automation Movement Representative Assembly was jointly convened by the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Anshan Municipal People's Government, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Anshan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Anshan Municipal Committee of the New Democratic Youth League. During the meeting, congratulatory telegrams or letters were received from dozens of agencies and factories and mines, including the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, the Northeast Administrative Committee, and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the preparatory committee of the China Metal and Smelting Workers' Union also awarded four banners to four factories and mines that had made outstanding achievements in renovating old equipment.

After the closing of the assembly, representatives from all over the country will continue to visit the mechanization and automation movement of factories and mines under Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and discuss the experience of mechanization and automation with workers and technicians of various factories and mines.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan: At the Anshan Continuing Mechanization and Automation Movement Representative Assembly held on August 22nd, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report to the assembly. In his report, Lai Ruoyu first extended congratulations to the assembly on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. He congratulated all the workers, technicians, model workers, and cadres attending the assembly for their great achievements in carrying out the mechanization and automation movement and their significant contributions to the national construction cause. Lai Ruoyu then said: From the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's (hereinafter referred to as Ansteel) mechanization and automation exhibition, we have seen the extremely valuable achievements that Ansteel has already made in mechanization. These achievements not only directly promote the rapid development of Ansteel and the rapid advancement of the national construction cause, but also greatly strengthen our confidence in moving forward and increase our confidence in completing the glorious and great construction cause. From your valuable creations, we see the bright future of our country. Lai Ruoyu said: After seeing the Ansteel mechanization and automation exhibition, I feel that the path to success of the model workers in mechanization and automation is of great educational significance to us.

First, all model workers and advanced producers are full of patriotism. They treat the affairs of the country as if they were their own. In order to complete the tasks of the country and accumulate more funds for the country, they have come up with many good ideas. This fully demonstrates the consciousness of the working class. Today, the working class has become the leading class of the country. This is the most important basis for us to highly develop our wisdom and have a constant stream of creations and inventions.

Second, after seeing this exhibition, I feel that comrades have all demonstrated collectivist spirit in their creations. These creations are not entirely thought of by one person, but concentrate the wisdom of many people. In particular, these creations prominently demonstrate the close combination of labor and technology. Therefore, all creations are creations of collectivism. This is also of great educational significance to us.

Third, all inventions and creations are achieved in the struggle against difficulties. There are many difficulties in our production, and these difficulties need to be overcome one by one. These difficulties existed in the past, and will continue to exist in the future. In the face of these difficult problems, our model workers have not succumbed, but have adopted the correct attitude - to fight against these difficulties, and finally overcome these difficulties. This means that the conservative thinking among our Ansteel employees has been broken. If conservative thinking is not broken, these difficulties will not be overcome, and the emergence of these creations will not be possible.

Lai Ruoyu encouraged the representatives at the meeting, saying: Our working class now has a high degree of patriotism, collectivism, and the spirit of overcoming difficulties. Therefore, I believe that we will continue to move forward and continue to achieve victory on the road of further mechanization. The development of mechanization will inevitably lead to the continuous improvement of our technical level. Without a highly developed technical foundation, it is impossible to truly build our country into a beautiful one. Lai Ruoyu finally said: The Chinese working class is hardworking and brave. After seeing the Ansteel mechanization and automation exhibition, I feel that the Chinese working class is not only hardworking and brave, but also very smart. Such a working class, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and with the help of the Soviet Union, will certainly be able to shoulder the glorious task of building a great motherland. I wish comrades continued success in further developing mechanization.

    鞍山市召开各工厂企业代表大会
    推进机械化自动化运动
    全国总工会主席赖若愚向大会作了报告
    【新华社鞍山二十五日电】鞍山市在八月二十二日到二十三日举行继续开展机械化自动化运动代表大会。这次大会总结了全市开展机械化自动化运动的成就和经验，并对今后继续开展这一运动作了具体布置。
    参加这次大会的有鞍山市各工厂企业代表四百多人。中华全国总工会主席赖若愚和东北总工会主席张维桢也到会指导。此外，中央人民政府重工业部、钢铁工业管理局和中国五金冶炼工会筹备委员会共同组织的全国各大行政区、各工业城市的二百多个代表也参加了大会。这些代表中包括劳动模范、管理干部、技术人员和工会干部。
    大会在总结了鞍山市开展机械化自动化运动的成就和经验以后，由六个在机械化自动化运动中获得显著成就的技术人员、工人和厂矿代表作了典型经验介绍。会上还以两亿七千万元和奖状，奖励了七百多个在开展机械化自动化运动中有显著成绩的工人和技术人员。中华全国总工会主席赖若愚在会上也讲了话。他指出：鞍山钢铁公司在开展机械化运动方面已经取得的极其宝贵的成就，不但直接推动着鞍山钢铁公司的迅速发展，推动着国家建设事业的迅速前进，同时也大大增加了我们完成光荣而伟大的建设事业的信心。赖若愚号召大家继续在机械化的道路上迈进，继续取得新的成就。
    鞍山市继续开展机械化自动化运动代表大会，是中共鞍山市委员会、鞍山市人民政府、鞍山钢铁公司、鞍山市总工会和新民主主义青年团鞍山市委员会联合召开的。在会议举行期间，收到了中华全国总工会、中央人民政府重工业部、东北行政委员会和东北总工会等几十个机关和厂矿的贺电或贺信。中华全国总工会和中国五金冶炼工会筹委会并以锦旗四面，奖给了改造旧设备有突出成就的四个厂矿。
    大会闭幕后，全国各地的代表将继续参观鞍山钢铁公司所属厂矿机械化自动化运动的情况，并和各厂矿的工人和技术人员座谈机械化自动化的经验。
    【新华社鞍山讯】在八月二十二日鞍山市举行的继续开展机械化自动化运动代表大会上，中华全国总工会主席赖若愚向大会作了报告。赖若愚在报告时，首先代表中华全国总工会向大会祝贺。他祝贺出席这次大会的全体职工、技术人员和全体劳动模范、干部们在开展机械化自动化运动中取得的巨大成就，对国家建设事业的重大贡献。赖若愚接着说：从鞍山钢铁公司（以下简称鞍钢）机械化自动化展览会上，看到了鞍钢机械化方面已经取得极其宝贵的成就。这些成就不但直接推动着鞍钢的迅速发展，推动着国家建设事业的迅速前进，同时也大大加强了我们前进的信心，增加了我们完成光荣而伟大的建设事业的信心。从你们宝贵的创造中，看到了我们国家的光明前途。赖若愚说：看到鞍钢机械化自动化展览会以后，感到劳动模范同志们在机械化自动化方面的成功的道路，对我们是有重大教育意义的。
    第一，所有劳动模范和先进生产者，都充满了爱国主义精神，他们对待国家的事情就像对待自己的事情一样。为了完成国家的任务，为了给国家积累更多的资金，他们想了很多好办法，这一点充分表现了工人阶级的觉悟。今天工人阶级已经成了国家的领导阶级，这就是我们可以高度地发挥智慧、源源不绝地出现好多创造发明的最重要的基础。
    第二，看了这个展览会以后，我感到同志们在创造方面都发挥了集体主义精神。这些创造不完全是一个人想出来的，而是集中了许多人的智慧。特别是在这些创造发明中，突出地表现了劳动和技术的紧密结合。因此，所有的创造都是集体主义的创造。这一点对我们也是有很大教育意义的。
    第三，所有创造发明都是在和困难的斗争中取得的。在我们生产中存在很多困难，这些困难需要我们一个一个去克服。这些困难过去存在，今后也是存在的。在这些困难问题面前，我们劳动模范同志们并没有屈服，而是采取了正确的态度——向这些困难作斗争，最后克服了这些困难。这就是说，在我们鞍钢职工之中的保守思想是被打破了。如果不打破保守思想，这些困难是不会克服的，这些创造的出现也是不可能的。
    赖若愚勉励到会代表说：我们工人阶级现在已经具有了高度的爱国主义精神、集体主义精神和克服困难的精神，所以，我相信我们在进一步开展机械化的道路上，一定会继续迈进，继续取得胜利。而机械化的发展，必将使我们的技术水平不断的提高。如果没有高度发展的技术基础，要真正把我们国家建设得美好是不可能的。赖若愚最后说：中国工人阶级是勤劳而勇敢的。我看了鞍钢机械化自动化展览会之后，感到中国工人阶级不但勤劳勇敢，而且还是很聪明的。这样的工人阶级，在毛主席和共产党领导之下，在苏联的帮助之下，一定可以担负起建设伟大祖国的光荣任务。祝同志们在进一步开展机械化的道路上，继续取得新的胜利。
