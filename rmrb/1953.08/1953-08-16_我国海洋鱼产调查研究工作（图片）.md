China's Marine Fish Production Survey and Research Work

China is a country with a long coastline and a vast fishing ground. Starting this year, the People's Government has been conducting organized surveys and research on some fishing grounds. This will not only help to grasp the life patterns of fish but also correctly estimate the fish stock in each fishing ground, so as to formulate reasonable production tasks and further develop China's rich marine fisheries.

This fishing ground survey team is composed of units such as the Central Ministry of Agriculture's Aquatic Products Research Institute, the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Marine Biology Research Laboratory, the Beijing Zoology Research Laboratory, Shandong University, and Shandong Aquatic Products Company. It includes oceanography experts, ichthyology experts, biology experts, and experienced aquatic product workers. Their central task this time is to investigate the mackerel (chub mackerel) fishing grounds in the Bohai Sea area. The scope of the investigation is very broad, including the physical and chemical properties of seawater, plankton in seawater (fish bait), and various biological characteristics of the fish themselves. These all affect fish migration and fishing ground shifts, and control fish growth and reproduction. Therefore, the fishing ground survey personnel need to conduct thorough scientific analysis.

Marine fish production survey and research is a very intensive and complex task. The staff has to conduct marine observations and research analysis day and night and often struggle with storms and huge waves at sea. At the same time, the Chinese People's Navy ensures maritime safety, enabling this survey work to be carried out safely.

A workboat dedicated to the fishing ground survey team begins work on the vast Bohai Sea.

Fishing vessels that cooperate with the survey also go out to sea to fish, providing research data needed for the investigation.

The survey of the mackerel fishing ground has begun. In order to first determine the location for investigation and research, the staff is using a sextant to determine the position of the ship according to longitude and latitude.

The magnitude of seawater salinity has a great influence on the distribution of fish. This is because some fish are accustomed to living in water layers with high salinity, while others are accustomed to living in water layers with low salinity. Staff are using reversing water samplers to collect seawater from various water layers to make thorough measurements and analyses of the seawater in each water layer in the fishing ground.

After collecting seawater from different depths in the fishing ground, preliminary measurements of specific gravity and colorimetry are carried out.

Wind speed and direction play a great role in understanding the migration routes of fish. Therefore, observing wind speed and direction is also a very important task in fishing ground surveys.

The distribution of plankton, which serves as fish bait, changes day and night. Therefore, the staff must observe and study day and night in order to study the growth and reproduction of fish from the changes in plankton.

Large quantities of mackerel have been caught, and the research work of the survey team can be fully carried out.

There are rings on the scales of fish that indicate their age. By observing and studying these scales, we can understand the composition and growth of the fish population.

"Tagging and releasing" involves tying silver tags to the tails of the captured mackerel, and then releasing them back into the sea. When these tagged fish are recaptured a second time, the migration routes of the fish can be inferred, and its growth rate can be found.

A laboratory has also been set up near the coastal area. Specimens and data collected from each voyage are sent here for preliminary sorting and analysis. This is the scene when ichthyology expert Zhang Xiaowei (right) and others are in the laboratory measuring the weight of the fish and preparing to dissect the stomach of the mackerel to study the bait and feeding performance of the mackerel.

    我国海洋鱼产调查研究工作
    我国是一个海岸线很长的国家，也是一个拥有广大渔场的国家。从今年起人民政府有组织地对一些渔场进行了调查研究工作，这样不仅可以掌握鱼类的生活规律，并可正确地估计每个渔场内鱼的蕴藏量，以便订出合理的生产任务，进一步发展我国丰富的海洋渔业。
    这是一个由中央农业部水产实验所、中国科学院海洋生物研究室、北京动物研究室、山东大学和山东水产公司等单位组成的渔场调查工作组，其中包括海洋学专家，鱼类学专家，生物学专家和经验丰富的水产工作者等。他们这次的中心任务是调查渤海一带鲭鱼（鲐鱼）渔场。调查的范围很广泛，包括海水的物理性质和化学性质、海水中的浮游生物（鱼的饵料）以及鱼类本身的各种生物特性——这些都影响着鱼类的回游及渔场迁移，控制着鱼类的生长和繁殖，因此都需要渔场调查人员作周密的科学分析。
    海洋鱼产调查研究是一件非常紧张而复杂的工作，工作人员要不分昼夜地进行海洋的观测和研究分析工作，经常要和海上的暴风巨浪作斗争。同时，我国人民海军确保了海上安全，使这一调查工作能够安全地进行。
    专供渔场调查工作组用的工作船在广阔的渤海海面上开始工作。
    配合调查工作的渔轮也随着一同出海捕鱼，供给调查需要的研究资料。
    鲭鱼渔场的调查工作开始了，工作人员为要首先确定调查研究的地点，正在用六分仪根据经纬度来测定船只的位置。
    海水盐液密度的大小对于支配鱼类的分布是有很大影响的。因为有的鱼习惯生活在盐液密度大的水层中，有的鱼却又习惯生活在盐液密度小的水层中。工作人员正在利用颠倒采水器采取各水层的海水，准备对渔场中各水层的海水作周密的测定和分析。
    采取了渔场中各层深度不同的海水后，再进行初步的比重及比色等的测定工作。
    风速风向对于了解鱼类的回游路线是有很大作用的，因此在渔场调查工作中，观察风速风向也是一件非常重要的工作。
    作为鱼的饵料的浮游生物，散布的情况日夜都有变化，因而工作人员就必须不分昼夜地观察研究，以便从浮游生物的变化来研究鱼类的生长和繁殖的情况。
    大量的鲭鱼捞起来了，调查工作组的研究工作就可以充分地展开了。
    在鱼的鳞片上有表示年龄的轮纹，观察研究了这些鳞片后，就可以了解鱼群的组成和生长的情况。
    “标志放流”是在捕获的鲭鱼的尾巴上拴系银质标志牌，然后再放回海水中，当第二次再捕获这些拴有标志的鱼时，就可以推定鱼类的回游路线，并找出它的生长率。
    在临海区域附近还设立了一个实验室，每次出海采集的标本和资料，都要送到这里来作初步整理和分析。这是鱼类学专家张孝威（右）等在实验室测定鱼的重量准备剖取鲭鱼的胃脏，研究鲭鱼的饵料和摄食性能时的情形。
