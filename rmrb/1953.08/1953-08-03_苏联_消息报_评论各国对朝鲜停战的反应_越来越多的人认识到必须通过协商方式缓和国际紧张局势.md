Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 1st: "Izvestia" today published an article in its international commentary column by V. Kudryavtsev, commenting on the reactions of newspapers around the world to the Korean armistice.

Kudryavtsev wrote that newspapers and the general public in countries of the peace and democracy camp believe that the Korean armistice is a great victory for the entire peace and democracy camp, because the proposition promoted by the American aggressive bloc to resolve international disputes by force has failed in Korea.

Kudryavtsev pointed out that, at the same time, many newspapers in capitalist countries also recognize the importance of the Korean armistice for the future of peace. A review of the comments in the French press shows that newspapers of various factions generally expressed the same view, which can be expressed in the following deeply emotional words: "Finally realized!" Some newspapers in the Netherlands, Denmark, India and other countries also expressed similar sentiments. Kudryavtsev continued, these comments express the strong desire of the broad masses in capitalist countries to ease international tensions.

Comments on the Korean armistice also show that the attempt by the organizers of the aggression against Korea to use this war to create a war psychosis around the world and use it as a stepping stone to expand the war has completely failed.

Kudryavtsev then wrote that peace-loving people are deeply satisfied with the Korean armistice, but this makes the American aggressive bloc very unhappy. Now, they are trying to distort the real reasons why the Korean armistice was achieved.

Everyone knows that the armistice was possible because the American aggressors' attempt to solve the Korean problem by force failed. However, American newspapers, such as the "New York Times," ignore the facts and try to convince their readers that the armistice was the result of the American army and their allied forces on the Korean front fighting it out.

Obviously, the American aggressive bloc is boasting about this non-existent victory in order to achieve a very simple purpose. These groups want to affirm that the armistice is the result of exercising military pressure on the Korean-Chinese side, in order to reduce the significance of the people's peace movement that is growing stronger after the Korean armistice.

Even after suffering a defeat in Korea, the American ruling groups today still vainly try to prove that expanding armaments is indeed the road to peace, and that the "policy of strength" is better than negotiation. It is for this reason that Dulles wants to undermine the satisfaction of the people of all countries and the American people with the Korean armistice. In a statement he made on the day the armistice agreement was signed, Dulles threatened the people, saying that peace would require no less sacrifice from them than war, or even more.

Kudryavtsev concluded that the people have drawn a conclusion from the lessons of the Korean War, namely that resolving outstanding issues through negotiation is the true path to easing international tensions. Even some bourgeois figures are increasingly aware of this.

    苏联“消息报”评论各国对朝鲜停战的反应
    越来越多的人认识到必须通过协商方式缓和国际紧张局势
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：“消息报”今天在国际述评栏中刊载了弗·库德里雅夫采夫所写的评论世界各地报纸对朝鲜停战的反应的文章。
    库德里雅夫采夫写道，和平民主阵营各国的报纸和广大公众认为，朝鲜停战是整个和平民主阵营的巨大胜利，因为美国侵略集团所宣传的用武力来解决国际的争执问题的主张，已经在朝鲜遭到了失败。
    库德里雅夫采夫指出，同时，在资本主义国家中，许多报纸也承认朝鲜停战对和平的前途是很重要的。综览一下法国各报的评论，就可以看出各种不同派别的报纸大体上都表示了同样的看法，这种看法可以用以下一句含有深刻感情的话来表示：“终于实现了！”荷兰、丹麦、印度和其他国家的某些报纸也表示了相似的情绪。库德里雅夫采夫接着说，这些评论表达了资本主义国家广大群众迫切要求缓和国际紧张局势的愿望。
    关于朝鲜停战的评论也说明，侵略朝鲜的组织者想利用这次战争来在全世界制造战争心理和利用它来作为扩大战争的踏脚石的企图，已经完全失败了。
    库德里雅夫采夫接着写道，爱好和平的人民对朝鲜停战深感满意，然而这却使美国侵略集团很不高兴。现在，他们正企图歪曲朝鲜停战所以能够实现的真正原因。
    大家知道，由于美国侵略者用武力解决朝鲜问题的企图遭到失败，停战才可能实现。然而美国的报纸，例如“纽约时报”，却不顾事实，力图使它的读者相信停战是美国军队和他们在朝鲜前线的盟军打出来的结果。
    很明显，美国侵略集团之所以吹嘘这个并无其事的胜利，为的是要达到一个很简单的目的。这些集团想肯定停战是对朝中方面行使军事压力的结果，以减低在朝鲜停战后日益壮大的人民和平运动的意义。
    即使在朝鲜遭到失败，美国统治集团今天还妄想证明扩张军备确是走向和平的道路，“实力政策”比协商好。正是为了这个原因，杜勒斯才要破坏各国人民和美国人民对朝鲜停战的满意情绪。杜勒斯在停战协定签字那天所作的声明中恫吓人民说，和平对他们所要求的牺牲，决不少于战争，甚至还要多些。
    库德里雅夫采夫最后说，人民从朝鲜战争的教训中得出一个结论，即通过商谈来解决悬而未决的问题是真正引向缓和国际紧张局势的道路。甚至某些资产阶级人士也越来越清楚地感到这一点。
