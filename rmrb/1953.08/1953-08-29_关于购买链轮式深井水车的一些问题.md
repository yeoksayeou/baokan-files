    Some Questions Regarding the Purchase of Chain-Driven Deep Well Water Wheels
    Editor's Note: After this newspaper published the news on April 21st about the successful trial production of chain-driven deep well water wheels by the Irrigation Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, readers have written in asking about the price and purchase methods of the water wheels. The following are the responses from the Irrigation Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government to these questions:

    I. Water Wheel Price: The ex-factory price of the chain-driven deep well water wheel manufactured by the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Factory is RMB 2 million, which includes 45 *shi* feet of water pipe with a diameter of 105 mm, 10 *zhang* and 7.5 *chi* of chain, 14 leather washers, and 3 repair tools. Freight is added separately according to the railway bureau regulations.

    II. Water Wheel Efficiency: A chain-driven deep well water wheel, used in wells 4.5 to 5 *zhang* deep, with a water pipe diameter of 100 to 105 mm, can pump 5 to 6 tons of water per hour. If it works for 10 hours a day, it can irrigate 2 to 3 *mu* of land. In wells 5 to 6 *zhang* deep, using a water pipe with a diameter of 90 mm, it can pump 4 to 5 tons of water per hour. If it works for 10 hours a day, it can irrigate 1 to 2 *mu* of land. If the well is deeper, the water wheel will be overloaded and easily damaged, so it is not suitable for use.

    III. Purchase Location and Installation/Usage Methods: Currently, only the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Factory has finished chain-driven deep well water wheels available for supply. Those who need them can directly contact the factory to order. The factory address is Lijiacun, outside the Jiefang Gate, Xi'an City. Instructions for the installation and use of the water wheel can be obtained from the factory when purchasing the water wheel for reference.

    关于购买链轮式深井水车的一些问题
    编者按：四月二十一日本报
    发表了中央人民政府水利部灌溉总局试制链轮式深井水车成功的消息后，读者纷纷来信询问水车的价格和购买方法等问题。现将中央人民政府水利部灌溉总局对这些问题的答复发表如下：
    一、水车价格：西北农业机械厂制造的链轮式深井水车，出厂价格每部二百余万元，其中包括直径一百零五公厘的水管四十五市尺，链子十丈零七尺半，皮钱十四枚，及修理工具三件，运费按铁路局规章另加。
    二、水车效能：链轮式深井水车在四丈五尺至五丈深的井上，用一百到一百零五公厘直径的水管，每小时出水五吨到六吨，如每天工作十小时，可浇地二亩到三亩。在五丈至六丈深的井上，用九十公厘直径的水管，每小时出水四吨到五吨，如每天工作十小时，可浇地一亩到二亩。井如果再深的话，水车负担过重，容易损坏，不宜使用。
    三、购置地点和安装、使用方法：现在链轮式深井水车只西北农业机械厂有成品供应，需要者可直接向该厂联系订购。该厂地址是西安市解放门外李家村。水车的安装及使用方法可在购买水车时向该厂索取说明书参考。
