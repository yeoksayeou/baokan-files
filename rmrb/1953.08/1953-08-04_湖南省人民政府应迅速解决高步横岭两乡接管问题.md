    The People's Government of Hunan Province Should Promptly Resolve the Takeover of Gaobu and Hengling Townships
    Reader Cheng Bingsen writes: Gaobu and Hengling Townships, originally under the jurisdiction of Linxi District, Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region, Guangxi Province, were approved by the former Central and Southern Military and Administrative Committee in July of last year to be placed under the jurisdiction of Tongdao County, Hunan Province. However, up to now, the Tongdao County People's Government has not taken over, while the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region People's Government believes that since the higher authorities have already decided to transfer jurisdiction to Hunan, they will no longer manage these two townships. As a result, the people of these two townships (mainly Dong compatriots, totaling about 13,000 people) have been affected in all aspects for the past year. For example, the relief grain for this year's spring season was not received by the people of these two townships. It was only after requests from various parties that it was reissued in April. The masses in the townships unanimously reflect: Since the People's Government wants to transfer us to Hunan, we hope that Hunan will take over quickly so that we can carry out various tasks effectively; otherwise, we should remain under Guangxi Province. How can we continue like this in a state of limbo where nobody cares for us? The Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region People's Government has repeatedly contacted the Tongdao County People's Government, and in April of this year, it specially sent Yang Fuzhen, Deputy Chief of the Civil Affairs Section, to Tongdao County to negotiate, but the county always uses excuses such as "busy work, lack of cadres" and has not yet taken over. It is hoped that the relevant leading organs will pay serious attention to this issue and resolve it promptly.

### 湖南省人民政府应迅速解决高步横岭两乡接管问题

专栏：读者来信摘要

    湖南省人民政府应迅速解决高步横岭两乡接管问题
    读者程炳森来信：原属广西省三江侗族自治区林溪区的高步、横岭两乡，于去年七月经前中南军政委员会批准，划归湖南省通道县管辖，但是直到现在通道县人民政府还没有接管，而三江侗族自治区人民政府则认为上级既已经决定划归湖南，也不再管这两乡。因而，这两乡人民（主要是侗族同胞，共约一万三千多人）一年以来在各方面都受到影响。如今年春季的救济粮，这两乡的人民就没有得到。后经各方面要求，到四月间才得到补发。乡内群众一致反映：人民政府既然要划我们归湖南，就希望湖南快点接管，使我们好开展各项工作，要不就仍归广西省。像这样两不管地继续下去，我们到底怎么办呢？三江侗族自治区人民政府，曾经屡次和通道县人民政府联络，今年四月间又专派民政科副科长杨富震去通道县交涉，但该县总是拿“工作繁忙、干部缺乏”等原因为借口，到现在还没有接管。希望有关领导机关切实重视这个问题，迅速予以解决。
