Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, August 20th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is vigorously developing state-owned trade and cooperative enterprises, and has formed a powerful trade network throughout Inner Mongolia. All nineteen major towns in the region now have agencies of state-owned trading companies. Cooperatives, including grassroots cooperatives, retail stores, and processing plants, have a total of 1,414 organizations and 1,090,000 members, accounting for more than 4% of the region's total population. Cooperatives have been established from the most remote grasslands of Inner Mongolia to the Greater Khingan Mountains where the Oroqen hunters live.

The trade volume of state-owned trade and cooperatives has been increasing year by year. If the total trade volume of state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in 1950 is taken as 100, it increased to 200 in 1951, and further increased to 277 in 1952. More than half of the total trade volume is the sales of agricultural and pastoral products of farmers and herdsmen. According to statistics, from 1950 to June 1953, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives sold approximately 78% of the region's total native and special products, equivalent to more than 815,000 tons of coarse grains. In the past, Inner Mongolia was relatively remote, and the agricultural and pastoral products of ordinary farmers and herdsmen were difficult to sell. Under the control and deception of illegal border merchants, prices were very low, and the scissors difference with industrial products was large. However, in recent years, with the vigorous promotion of state-owned trading companies and cooperatives, farmers and herdsmen have been able to sell their grain, livestock, fur, and other products, even the reeds that farmers used to burn as firewood and the waste bones that herdsmen threw in the garbage have found a market. According to statistics, by last year, the cooperatives had sold 30 million catties of reeds and 3.5 million catties of waste bones for farmers and herdsmen, with a total value of 5.45 billion yuan. The prices of agricultural and pastoral products and various native and special products have also been appropriately increased, so the phenomenon of unequal exchange of agricultural and pastoral products and industrial products in the past has been completely changed.

The increase and smooth sales of various products have encouraged the enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen for production. With the continuous development of production, the purchasing power of farmers and herdsmen has also greatly increased. In 1952, the average purchasing power per person in Inner Mongolia increased by 125% compared with 1948. Therefore, the state-owned trading companies and cooperatives have also continuously increased the supply of daily necessities and means of production needed by farmers and herdsmen. In 1952, the cooperatives supplied seven times more industrial products to farmers and herdsmen than in 1949, and the variety of goods also increased from two or three hundred to two or three thousand. The number of goods supplied for agricultural implements alone reached more than 300,000 pieces. At present, the Inner Mongolia Department Store is making intensive preparations to ensure supply during the peak season this year. Based on the characteristics that coarse cloth and coarse grains can no longer meet market needs, a large amount of rice, white flour, fine cloth, printed cloth, serge, twill, various colored silks and satins, woolen cloth, flashlights, canvas beds, phonographs, fruits, and various liqueurs have been successively transported to wholesale stations such as Tongliao and Zhalantun.

### 内蒙古大力发展国营贸易和合作社事业

    内蒙古大力发展国营贸易和合作社事业
    【新华社归绥二十日电】内蒙古自治区大力发展国营贸易和合作社事业，已在内蒙古全境构成一个强大的贸易网。现在全区十九个主要城镇都已设有国营贸易公司的机构。合作社包括基层社、零售店、加工厂在内共有一千四百一十四个机构，社员达一百零九万人，占全区人口总数百分之四以上；从内蒙最边远的草原，到鄂伦春猎民们所散居的大兴安岭都已建立了合作社。
    国营贸易和合作社历年来贸易额都在不断地增加。如以一九五○年国营贸易公司和合作社的贸易总额为一百，一九五一年就增加为二百，一九五二年又增加为二百七十七。贸易总额中有一半以上的交易是推销农、牧民的生产品。据统计：从一九五○年到一九五三年六月经国营贸易公司、合作社推销的土产特产品，约占全区土产特产总数的百分之七十八，折合粗粮达八十一万五千多吨。过去，内蒙古地区比较偏僻，一般农、牧民的生产品因不易找到销路，在不法边商操纵和欺骗下，价格很低，与工业品的剪刀差额很大。但近几年来在国营贸易公司和合作社的大力推销下，农、牧民生产的粮食、牲畜、皮毛等都得到畅销，连过去根本没有销路的农民用来当柴烧的苇子，牧民们扔在垃圾里的废骨，都给找到销路了，据统计到去年为止，合作社给农、牧民推销的苇子达三千万斤，废骨三百五十万斤，总值五十四亿五千万元。农、牧产品和各种土产特产的价格也适当地提高了，因之过去农、牧产品与工业品不等价交换的现象也彻底改变了。
    各种生产品价格的提高和畅销，鼓舞了农、牧民生产的积极性，随着生产的不断发展，农、牧民的购买力也大大提高了。一九五二年，内蒙古平均每人的购买力比一九四八年提高了百分之一百二十五。因此，每年国营贸易公司和合作社供应农、牧民所需要的生活资料和生产资料也不断的增加起来。一九五二年合作社供应农、牧民各种工业品比一九四九年增加了七倍，各种货物的品种也由过去两三百种增加到两三千种。货物供应的数量仅农具一项即达三十余万件。现在，内蒙古百货公司正为保证今年旺季供应，进行紧张准备工作。根据粗布、粗粮已不能满足市场需要的特点，大量的大米、白面及细布、花布、哔叽、斜纹布、各色绸缎、呢绒、手电筒、帆布床、留声机、水果、各种露酒等，已陆续运到通辽、扎兰屯等批发站。
