    To Provide Accurate Data for Industrial Construction
    Large-Scale Geological Exploration Work Launched Nationwide

    With the unfolding of national economic construction work, geological work is advancing with unprecedented scale and a brand-new attitude, according to the national plan.

    In order to meet the needs of the iron and steel industry, non-ferrous metal industry, fuel industry, heavy chemical industry, and basic construction of the construction industry, the geological work in 1953 is undertaking a huge exploration task. The total workload this year is 630 percent of last year. The total workload of a series of tasks such as geological surveys, mineral exploration, and laboratory analysis has also greatly exceeded that of last year. Topographic surveying and mapping of topographic maps of various scales is 903 percent of last year; geological exploration and filling in geological maps of various scales is 197 percent of last year; light mountain work is 675 percent of last year; heavy mountain work is 685 percent of last year; drilling work is 817 percent of last year; and the analysis of mineral samples to be completed in the laboratory will reach hundreds of thousands.

    In order to cooperate with the survey and design of important projects and the needs of construction projects, the geological department is also undertaking a certain amount of engineering geological work this year. This includes the water conservancy projects of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, Han River, Huai River, Yongding River, and the Northeast region, as well as some important hydroelectric power stations; it also includes the exploration of groundwater for newly built railways and factory foundations.

    In order to discover more widely the treasures under the motherland's soil and to create conditions for further exploration and design in the future, a certain area of general survey and preliminary survey work will also be completed in 1953.

    According to the tasks assigned by the state, in terms of field work: various different comprehensive (including surveying and mapping, geology, prospecting, testing, etc.) key exploration teams, field prospecting teams, engineering geology teams, physical prospecting teams, etc. have now been formed, and these teams have successively set off to the vast land of dozens of provinces across the motherland. From the grasslands of Inner Mongolia to the jungles of Hainan Island, from high mountains at an altitude of 5,000 meters to flat plains, the footprints of mineral explorers have begun to appear in places rich in iron, copper, manganese, chromium, tungsten, lead, zinc, tin, coal, petroleum, diamonds, asbestos, sulfur, phosphorus and other minerals needed for industrial construction. They climb steep cliffs and shrub-covered slopes, and persevere in their work under difficult living conditions such as freezing temperatures of minus 40 degrees, perennial rain and fog, and lack of water and sparse population. In order to dig well water for the drilling rig to use in the frozen deep strata, the workers of Team 241 used horse manure day and night to warm the strata and chisel downwards, finally finding a water source. In a copper mine exploration team in the southwest, because the air was too humid, the yellow medicine quickly lost its effect after being put into the blast hole and could not explode. Worker Li Kairong developed a method of using pig intestines to hold the yellow medicine and installing moisture-resistant black explosives on both ends, which not only avoided moisture but also increased the blasting power. The geologists and surveyors of the team are making their best efforts to carry out surveying and mapping work in advance in order to avoid the difficulty of being unable to work when the rainy season arrives.

    In just a few months, the various field teams have made significant achievements in their work. In the key exploration areas, in addition to carrying out a large number of trenching operations, hundreds of drilling rigs have been started, and some areas are carrying out pit and cave exploration work as needed to explore the occurrence of minerals and analyze and identify their grade; some have even begun to accurately calculate their reserves. The vast field prospecting teams are carrying out the search for various useful minerals according to predetermined goals. Team 111 has completed the preliminary exploration of a manganese mine in a certain area and produced a cross-sectional map, and also discovered siderite. Team 122 has completed the prospecting work of another 25-square-kilometer manganese mine. Team 143 explored an old copper mine tunnel and preliminarily determined the pit exploration location. Other teams have also achieved great results, and have carried out some preliminary preliminary survey work in many places.

    Indoor research work has begun to establish close links with field work, studying the actual difficulties and specimens encountered in exploration by the field teams, and providing information to the field teams, which has played a major role in guiding practical work. For example, the Institute of Geology has conducted research on manganese mines based on exploration needs. Specifically solve the genesis, enrichment conditions, and ore properties of aqueous manganese deposits. According to the information provided by the Institute of Geology, a manganese mine team in a certain area learned the laws of primary manganese deposits, which had a great effect in practical work and avoided many detours. For example, in order to solve the problem of smooth smelting of an iron ore in the future, the Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Geology are now conducting a comprehensive analysis of the ore in the area and the identification of refractory materials. In order to meet the needs of Anshan Iron and Steel production, the Institute of Geology is conducting research on magnesite. For the sake of long-term construction in the future, the Institute of Geology has also begun to study the geological structural patterns of China this year. The Institute of Paleontology has also determined some important work projects to identify fossils for the field teams in a timely manner in order to determine the age of the strata; and compile and print standardized fossil manuals, etc., which also play an important guiding role in the current exploration work. The Institute of Paleontology is also conducting research on China's paleogeography in order to explore the distribution range of certain sedimentary mineral deposits.

    In order to complete the national task, it is necessary to quickly grow our strength. In terms of cultivating strength, in addition to taking on apprentices in practical work to solve the current shortage of manpower, the geological work department has also established two new geological colleges and three secondary technical schools. Thousands of young students are studying intensively; and they take turns to go to the field for internships. In addition, a large number of drilling worker training classes have been held, and personnel are regularly transferred to various construction sites.

    The large-scale and smooth development of geological work and the beginning of achievements are primarily due to the realization of centralized unification of geological work, overcoming the past state of dispersion, and enabling geological work to shift from individual and isolated explorations to collective and organized progress; from general theoretical research to close integration with practice. Secondly, learning from the advanced scientific theories and technical experience of the Soviet Union has further improved the professional level of the vast number of geological personnel. For example, the working method of geological observation points has been widely adopted. Soviet experts also went deep into the construction sites to help Chinese geological workers correct many errors in exploration design. The drilling work learned the Soviet advanced experience of one-time sand injection method, rapid drilling method, and mud operation method; the laboratory work learned advanced laboratory methods and assembly line operation method, and laboratory quality inspection method, which played a major role in improving work efficiency and quality. Now all employees are launching a movement to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in accordance with Chairman Mao's great call to learn from the Soviet Union. Thirdly, it is due to the arduous efforts of geological exploration workers and the support of the people of the whole country. With the help of the local government and the people of all ethnic groups, various field teams have solved the problems of guides, housing, trenching, cave exploration, drilling water supply migrant workers and many other difficult problems. The enthusiasm of the masses in reporting mines is very high, reaching 1,977 places as of the end of May.

    为工业建设提供精确的资料
    全国地质勘探工作大规模展开
    随着国家经济建设工作的展开，地质工作正以空前未有的巨大规模和崭新的姿态，按照国家的计划，向前推进。
    为了满足钢铁工业、有色金属工业、燃料工业、重化学工业以及建筑业基本建设的需要，一九五三年的地质工作担负了巨大的勘探任务。今年总的工作量为去年的百分之六百三十。地质调查、矿产勘探直到化验分析等一系列的工作总量，也都大大超过了去年。地形测量，绘制各种比例尺的地形图为去年的百分之九百零三；地质勘查，填写各种比例尺的地质图为去年的百分之一百九十七；轻型山地工作，为去年的百分之六百七十五；重型山地工作，为去年的百分之六百八十五；钻探工作，为去年的百分之八百一十七；化验工作也将完成数达十万计的矿样分析。
    为了配合重要工程的勘测设计和建筑工程的需要，今年地质部门还担负了一定数量的工程地质工作。其中包括黄河、长江、汉水、淮河、永定河以及东北区的水利工程和某些重要的水力发电站等；也包括新筑铁路和厂基地下水的勘查工作。
    为了更广泛地发现祖国地下的宝藏，并为今后进一步的勘探设计创造条件，一九五三年还要完成一定地区的普查和预查工作。
    根据国家所交给的任务，在野外工作方面：现已组成了各种不同的综合性的（包括测绘、地质、探矿、化验等）重点勘探队、野外普查队、工程地质队、物理探矿队等，这些队已先后出发到祖国数十省辽阔广大的土地上。从内蒙古的草原到海南岛的丛林里，从拔海五千公尺的高山到坦平的原野上，在蕴藏着大量的铁、铜、锰、铬、钨、铅、锌、锡、煤、石油、金刚石、石棉、硫、磷等工业建设所需的矿产的地方，都开始印上了矿产勘探者的足迹。他们攀登悬崖峭壁的山峰和灌木丛生的陡坡，在零下四十度的严寒和常年雨雾弥漫以及水源缺乏、人迹稀少等困难的生活条件下坚持工作。二四一队的职工为了在冰冻的深厚地层内打出井水供钻机使用，用马粪日以继夜地把地层烘暖，向下凿进，终于找到水源。西南某铜矿勘探队，因空气过于潮湿，洞探工程中黄药放入炮眼后很快丧失作用而不能爆炸，工人李开荣研究出用猪肠子装黄药，两端装上耐潮的黑色炸药，不仅避免了潮湿，而且增加了爆破能力。该队地质人员和测工，为了避免雨季到来不能工作的困难，正尽最大的努力提前进行勘测填图工作。
    各野外队在短短的数月中，工作已有显著的成绩。在重点勘探的地区除大量进行槽探工作外，数百台钻机已经开动，部分地区并根据需要进行着坑、洞探工作，探明矿物的产状，分析鉴定它的品位；有些并已开始精确地计算它的储量。广大的野外普查队，已按照预定的目标，进行着各种有用矿物的寻找工作。一一一队已完成了某地锰矿初步勘查工作，并作出了剖面图，同时还发现了菱铁矿。一二二队完成了另一处二十五平方公里的锰矿普查工作。一四三队勘查了一处铜矿老洞，初步决定了坑探地点。其他各队也都取得了很大成绩，并且在不少地方进行了一些初步的预查工作。
    室内研究工作已和野外工作开始建立了紧密的联系，研究由野外队提出的在勘探中所遇到的实际疑难和标本，并向野外队提供资料，对指导实际工作起了重大作用。如地质研究所根据勘探需要，进行了锰矿的研究。具体解决水成锰矿的成因、富集的条件、矿石的性质等问题。某处锰矿队根据地质研究所供给的资料，了解锰矿原生矿床的规律，在实际工作中得到很大效果，避免了很多弯路。又如为了解决一处铁矿将来的顺利冶炼问题，科学院和地质研究所现正进行该区矿石的全面分析以及耐火材料的鉴定。为了适应鞍钢生产的需要，地质研究所正进行着镁砂的研究。为今后长期建设打算，地质研究所并从今年开始着手研究中国的地质构造型式等问题。古生物研究所也确定了一些重要的工作项目，为野外队及时鉴定化石，以便决定地层时代；并编印标准化石手册等，对当前勘探工作也起着重要的指导作用。古生物研究所并进行着中国古地理的研究工作，借以探寻某些沉积矿床分布的范围。
    为了完成国家任务，必须迅速生长力量。在力量的培养上，地质工作部门除了在实际工作中带徒弟，以解决当前力量的不足以外，并举办了两个新型的地质学院和三个中等技术学校。数千个青年学生正在紧张地学习；并轮流出发到野外实习。此外并举办了大量的钻探工人训练班，经常向各工地输送力量。
    地质工作得以大规模地顺利开展并开始取得成绩，首先是由于地质工作实现了集中统一，克服了过去的分散的状态，使地质工作由个别的、孤立的摸索，转向集体的、有组织的迈进；由一般的理论研究转向密切结合实际。其次是学习了苏联先进的科学理论和技术经验，使广大地质人员的业务水平得到了进一步的提高，例如地质观测点的工作方法，已被广泛采用。苏联专家并深入工地，帮助中国的地质工作者纠正了勘探设计上的很多错误。钻探工作学习了一次投砂法、快速钻进法、泥浆作业法；化验工作学习了先进化验方法和流水作业法、化验质量检查法等苏联先进经验，对提高工作效率和质量，起了重大作用。现在全体职工正根据毛主席所指示的学习苏联的伟大号召，开展一个学习苏联先进经验的运动。再次是由于地质勘探工作人员的艰苦努力和全国人民的支援。各个野外队在当地政府和各族人民群众的帮助下解决了向导问题、住房问题、槽、洞探和钻探输水民工及其他许多困难问题。各地群众报矿热情很高，截至五月底止，已达一千九百七十七处。
