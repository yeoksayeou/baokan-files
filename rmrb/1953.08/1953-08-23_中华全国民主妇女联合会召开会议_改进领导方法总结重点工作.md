Xinhua News Agency, 22nd:

    Since the Second National Women's Congress of China held in April this year, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and its subordinate federations at all levels have begun to transform their leadership style and working methods, and have been systematically going deep into key areas to accumulate experience in several major tasks in current women's work. As of the end of June, in addition to the All-China Women's Federation participating in the work of three key areas, the All-China Women's Federation's East China, Northwest China, and Central South China Work Committees, and 27 provincial (municipal) women's federations, have selected a total of 77 key areas to carry out work. These different types of key areas include large, medium, and small cities, as well as old liberated areas and newly liberated rural areas. The scope and focus of understanding and research in various places are also different. In cities, the focus is mainly on strengthening ideological education for female workers, ensuring attendance rates of female workers, implementing labor protection work for female workers, carrying out work among workers' families, and work among housewives. In rural areas, the focus is mainly on studying issues such as women's participation in agricultural production, promoting maternal and child health and child care work, giving play to the role of grassroots women's representative meetings, and training female cadres, female activists, and female labor models. In addition, mobilizing women to participate in the general election movement is also a task that most women's federations are very concerned about and pay attention to during this period.
    In order to further implement the spirit of the Second National Women's Congress regarding going deep into work, deep into reality, facing the grassroots, selecting key areas, and accumulating experience, and to continue to improve the leadership methods and working methods of the women's federation system, and to conduct preliminary checks on the progress of several key tasks, the All-China Women's Federation convened a working conference on August 3rd. In addition to the resident members of the Standing Committee and the heads and deputy heads of various departments, responsible comrades from the All-China Women's Federation's East China and North China Work Committees, and the Beijing and Tianjin Municipal Women's Federations attended the meeting. The meeting spent two days listening to reports from the All-China Women's Federation's East China Work Committee, the All-China Women's Federation's work team participating in the general election in Jilin, and the Tianjin Municipal Women's Federation on mobilizing women in the pilot work of grassroots general elections. The meeting also heard investigation reports from the All-China Women's Federation's rural work team in Heilongjiang on several important issues in rural women's participation in production, and reports from the Beijing Municipal Work Team on the work of the women in Weiying Hutong in Beijing. The meeting discussed the mobilization of women to participate in the general election and rural women's work, and focused on discussing the improvement of the leadership methods and working methods of the women's federation system. Finally, Vice Chairman Zhang Yun made a comprehensive speech.
    Zhang Yun first pointed out: Going deep into key areas and accumulating experience is an excellent working method. Judging from the reports at this meeting, all localities have gained good experience in different aspects and to varying degrees, and have discovered shortcomings in past work. The All-China Women's Federation and women's federations at all levels must persist in this approach, go deep into key areas, and continue to accumulate experience. Then, based on the reports at the meeting, she summarized and analyzed the basic laws of women's work, believing that women's work must implement the principle of mobilizing both men and women, and must be carried out under the unified leadership, unified deployment, and unified implementation of the local Party committee. At the same time, it is necessary to carry out in-depth "processing" education targeting the ideological characteristics of women, and gradually alleviate their practical difficulties targeting the special problems of women. The women's federation itself must, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, cooperate with all relevant parties, divide responsibilities, and complete tasks together.
    Zhang Yun finally emphasized the issue of improving the leadership methods of the women's federation. She pointed out that the leadership methods of women's federations at all levels have been continuously improving in recent years. After analyzing the nature and characteristics of women's work, she explained that the women's federation must carry out women's work under the unified leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and its Party committees at all levels. She asked women's federations at all levels to strictly prevent and check and correct the tendency of decentralism in leadership based on this spirit. She also pointed out that emphasizing that the women's federation must carry out its work under the leadership of the Party committee does not mean reducing the work of the women's federation itself, nor does it mean reducing the concern and assistance of the higher-level women's federation for the work of the lower-level women's federation. The higher-level women's federation is the leading body of the lower-level women's federation, and it has the responsibility to earnestly help and guide the work of the lower-level women's federation, especially to focus on helping the lower-level women's federation summarize and exchange work experience. She also pointed out that the women's federation itself must truly establish a division of labor and responsibility system under unified and centralized leadership. The main leaders must be good at promoting democracy, gathering opinions from all parties, and giving play to the role of collective leadership.
    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation held its first meeting of the Second Standing Committee on August 18th. The meeting was attended by Vice Chairmen Li Dequan, Xu Guangping, Zhang Yun, and Standing Committee members Wang Jingcheng, Xu Zhiyin, Kang Keqing, Lei Jieqiong, Liu Wang Liming, and others, totaling fifteen people.
    The meeting was presided over by Vice Chairman Zhang Yun. Deputy Secretary-General Luo Qiong reported to the Standing Committee on the main domestic and international work of the All-China Women's Federation over the past three months. Subsequently, the meeting discussed and approved the All-China Women's Federation's work plan for August to December 1953. The plan stipulates that the most important task during this period is to further implement the spirit of the resolutions of the Second National Women's Congress and continue to improve the leadership methods and working methods of the Democratic Women's Federation. The plan emphasized that the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and women's federations at all levels must be good at carrying out their work under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and its Party committees at all levels. At the same time, women's federations at all levels must adhere to going deep into the grassroots, deep into reality, facing the masses of women, conducting women's work based on the characteristics of women, and selecting key areas to accumulate experience, thereby overcoming decentralism and bureaucracy in leadership. The plan requires the All-China Women's Federation to assist several local women's federations in a focused manner, going deep into key areas and accumulating experience. The plan also requires improving the editing and publishing work of the "New China Women's Monthly" magazine. In terms of international work, the plan stipulates that the work of our country's secretary at the International Women's Federation should be strengthened, preparations should be made for attending the next Executive Committee of the International Women's Federation, connections with women in several countries should be strengthened in a planned and focused manner, and international propaganda work should be further improved and enhanced.
    The meeting finally unanimously passed the resolution on the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and its affiliated organizations joining the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as group members.
    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: On August 18th, the first meeting of the Second Standing Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation was held, and a resolution was passed on the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and its affiliated organizations joining the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as group members.

    中华全国民主妇女联合会召开会议
    改进领导方法总结重点工作
    【新华社二十二日讯】自今年四月举行的中国第二次全国妇女代表大会之后，中华全国民主妇女联合会与各级民主妇女联合会已开始转变领导作风和工作方法，有计划地深入重点地区，积累当前妇女工作中几项主要工作的经验。截至六月底为止，除全国妇联参加了三个重点地区的工作外，全国妇联华东、西北、中南区工作委员会及二十七个省（市）妇联，共选择了七十七个重点地区进行工作。这些不同类型的重点地区中，包括大、中、小城市和老解放区与新解放区的农村。各地了解和研究范围和重点也不相同。在城市，主要是围绕着加强女工的思想教育，保证女工出勤率，贯彻执行女工劳动保护工作，开展工人家属工作及家庭劳动妇女工作等方面的问题；在农村，主要是对妇女参加农业生产，推进妇婴卫生与儿童保育工作，发挥基层妇女代表会的作用，培养女干部、女积极分子与女劳动模范等方面的问题进行研究。此外，发动妇女参加普选运动，也是这一时期大多数妇联所十分关心并注意研究的工作。
    全国妇联为了进一步贯彻第二次全国妇女代表大会关于深入工作，深入实际，面向基层，选择重点，积累经验的精神，继续改进妇联系统的领导方法和工作方法，并初步检查几处重点工作进行的情况，在八月三日召开了会务会议。出席会议的除驻会常务委员、各部正副部长外，并有全国妇联华东区、华北区工作委员会及北京、天津两市妇联的负责同志。会议以两天的时间听取了全国妇联华东区工作委员会、全国妇联派赴吉林参加普选的工作组及天津市妇联关于基层普选典型试办工作中发动妇女问题的汇报；听取了全国妇联派赴黑龙江的农村工作组关于农村妇女参加生产中的几个重要问题的调查报告，以及北京市工作组关于北京市未英胡同妇女工作的汇报。会议讨论了发动妇女参加普选工作和农村妇女工作问题，并集中讨论了关于改善妇联系统的领导方法和工作方法问题。最后由章蕴副主席作了综合性的发言。
    章蕴首先指出：深入重点，积累经验，是极好的工作方法，从这次会议中汇报的情况来看，各地都已取得了不同方面不同程度的良好经验，并发现了过去工作中的毛病。全国妇联及各级妇联必须坚持下去，深入重点，继续积累经验。接着她根据此次汇报，概括地分析了妇女工作的基本规律，认为妇女工作必须贯彻男女一齐发动的方针，而且必须在当地党委的统一领导下，统一布置，统一进行。同时又必须针对妇女的思想特点，进行深入的“加工”的教育，针对妇女的特殊问题，逐步解除其实际困难。而妇联本身，必须在党委统一领导之下，与各有关方面配合，分工合作，共同完成。
    章蕴最后着重谈到了关于改进妇联领导方法的问题。她指出近年来各级妇联的领导方法，正在不断改进中。她在分析了妇女工作的性质和特点之后，说明妇联必须在中国共产党中央和它的各级党委统一领导下进行妇女工作。她要求各级妇联本此精神严格防止和检查纠正领导上的分散主义的倾向。她又指出：强调妇联必须在党委的领导下进行工作，并不等于减轻妇联本身的工作，并不等于减轻上级妇联对下级妇联工作的关心与帮助。上级妇联是下级妇联的领导机关，它有责任认真地帮助和指导下级妇联的工作，特别要着重帮助下级妇联总结和交流工作经验。她还指出：妇联本身必须真正建立起统一集中领导下的分工负责制。主要领导人必须善于发扬民主，集合各方面的意见，发挥集体领导的作用。
    【新华社二十二日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会在八月十八日举行第二届第一次常务委员会，出席会议的有副主席李德全、许广平、章蕴及常务委员王竟成、徐芝寅、康克清、雷洁琼、刘王立明等十五人。
    会议由章蕴副主席主持。副秘书长罗琼向常委会报告了关于近三个多月来全国妇联的国内、国际方面的主要工作。接着讨论并通过了全国妇联一九五三年八月到十二月的工作计划。计划中规定：这时期中最主要的工作，是进一步贯彻第二次全国妇女代表大会的决议的精神，继续改进民主妇联的领导方法和工作方法。计划中强调指出，全国民主妇联及各级妇联必须善于在中国共产党中央委员会及其各级党委领导下进行工作；同时，各级妇联必须坚持深入基层，深入实际，面向妇女群众，根据妇女特点，进行妇女工作，并选择重点，积累经验，从而克服领导上的分散主义和官僚主义。计划要求，全国妇联应有重点地协助几个地方妇联，深入重点，积累经验。计划并要求改进“新中国妇女月刊”的编辑出版工作。在国际工作方面，计划规定，应加强我国驻国际妇联书记的工作，准备出席国际妇联下届执行委员会，有计划有重点地加强与若干国家妇女的联系，进一步改进和提高国际宣传工作等。
    会议最后一致通过了关于中华全国民主妇女联合会及其所属组织参加中苏友好协会为团体会员的决议。
    【新华社二十二日讯】八月十八日，中华全国民主妇女联合会第二届第一次常务委员会举行会议，通过了关于中华全国民主妇女联合会及其所属组织参加中苏友好协会为团体会员的决议。决议如下：
    加强中苏两国人民的友好合作和学习苏联，是全国人民的最大利益和重大的政治任务。常委会一致决议：中华全国民主妇女联合会及其所属各级组织应参加中苏友好协会为团体会员，并应与中苏友好协会密切联系，根据当地的具体情况，妇女群众的觉悟水平，结合自己的中心工作，经常在妇女群众中，大力宣传加强中苏友好合作，学习苏联；学习苏联妇女光辉榜样的重大任务。
