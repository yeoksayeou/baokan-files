Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th – Due to the unreasonable restrictions and obstruction by the US prisoner-of-war camp authorities, our Red Cross representatives in South Korea find it difficult to carry out their work. According to Zhang Runhe, a captured member of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who returned from the eighth prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island on the 11th: After our Red Cross representatives arrived on Jeju Island, the US prisoner-of-war camp authorities limited our representatives' visits to our captured personnel to only between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM and between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM. Later, they used the excuse of checking the words of consolation to delay the visits, changing the allowed visiting time to only one hour. Finally, they even stubbornly disagreed with the draft of the consolation message from our Red Cross representatives, only allowing them to meet with one representative of our captured personnel, making the originally planned visit impossible. At the same time, the US side only allowed our representatives to visit designated prisoner-of-war residences, forbidding them from visiting any locations where incidents of US persecution of our captured personnel had occurred, and prohibiting meetings in the prisoner-of-war residences.

Li Guoru, who returned from the same prisoner-of-war camp on August 7th, said that at the Imjin River bridge, the US side only allowed our Red Cross representatives to speak with our captured personnel outside the barbed wire. When our representatives delivered words of consolation to our captured personnel, the US side suddenly claimed one minute before the agreed time that they wanted to check the consolation message to see if it had any "political content," deliberately creating obstacles. According to Wang Wentao, another returnee, when our Red Cross representatives spoke to our captured personnel through loudspeakers outside the barbed wire, the US side deliberately drove a large number of water trucks, trucks, and road rollers around the loudspeakers at this time, making it difficult for our captured personnel to hear the content of the speeches.

Our female captured personnel who returned on August 8th also encountered similar situations. They arrived in Busan on August 7th, and the US side did not allow our Red Cross representatives to visit them, hurriedly putting them on a train; but when the captured personnel in the last carriage spoke with our Red Cross representatives, the US side ordered the representatives to leave immediately.

Our captured personnel who returned from Geoje Island told reporters that our Red Cross representatives who visited Geoje Island lived in barracks surrounded by two layers of barbed wire and were tightly guarded by US military police. The US side prohibited them from going out. Their speeches to the captured personnel and the content of individual conversations had to be approved in advance by the commander of the US prisoner-of-war camp. The US side also refused to distribute the 11,000 letters of consolation written in the names of nine Korean and Chinese organizations, claiming that the "content was inappropriate."

### 由于美方战俘营当局的无理限制和阻挠  我方红十字会代表在南朝鲜难于进行工作

    由于美方战俘营当局的无理限制和阻挠
    我方红十字会代表在南朝鲜难于进行工作
    【新华社开城十三日电】由于美方战俘营当局的无理限制和阻挠，我方红十字会代表在南朝鲜已难于进行工作。据十一日从济州岛第八号战俘营归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员张润和谈：我方红十字会代表到达济州岛后，美方战俘营当局限制我方代表只能于上午十时至十二时，下午二时至四时访问我方被俘人员，后来又藉口检查慰问词，延误了访问时间，改为只允许访问一小时，最后竟蛮横地不同意我方红十字会代表的慰问稿，仅允许与我方被俘人员代表一人见面，致使原定的访问根本无法进行；同时，美方只准许我方代表访问被指定的战俘住地，不准他们访问曾发生美方迫害我方被俘人员事件的任何地点，并禁止在战俘住地开会。
    八月七日由同一战俘营归来的李国儒谈，在临津江桥，美方只准许我方红十字会代表在铁丝网外与我方被俘人员谈话。我方代表向我方被俘人员致慰问词时，在约定时间前一分钟美方突然声称要检查慰问稿，看有没有“政治性内容”，蓄意进行阻难。另据归来人员王文涛谈，当我方红十字会代表在铁丝网外以扩音机向我方被俘人员讲话时，美方故意在这时开来大批装水车、货车和压路机在扩音机周围开动，使我方被俘人员听不清讲话内容。
    八月八日归来的我方女被俘人员也遇到了类似情形。她们在八月七日到达釜山，美方不准我方红十字会代表访问她们，匆忙地把她们装在火车上；但当坐在最后一节车厢的我方被俘人员和我方红十字会代表谈话时，美方就命令代表们立刻离开。
    从巨济岛归来的我方被俘人员告诉记者，到巨济岛访问的我方红十字会代表住在两道铁丝网围起来的营房内，被美方宪兵看守得很紧。美方禁止他们外出。他们对被俘人员的讲话稿以及个别谈话内容，必须事先经过美方战俘营司令官批准。我方代表带去的以朝、中九个团体名义所写的一万一千封慰问信，美方也藉口“内容不合适”而不准分发。
