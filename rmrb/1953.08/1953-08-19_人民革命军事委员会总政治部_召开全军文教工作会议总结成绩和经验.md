    The General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission
    Convenes All-Army Cultural and Educational Work Conference to Summarize Achievements and Experiences
    The General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government convened an all-army cultural and educational work conference on July 27th to summarize the achievements and experiences of the past year's cultural and educational work in the army, and to study and discuss the cultural and educational issues of the troops in the future. More than 100 people attended the conference, including the heads of propaganda departments and cultural and educational sections of the political departments of major military regions, special forces, and various schools, as well as representatives of outstanding cultural instructors from various units.

    At the meeting, the heads of propaganda departments of various units first reported on the cultural and educational work of their respective units over the past year. Finally, Liu Zhijian, Director of the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department, made a report on the "Basic Summary of One Year's Cultural and Educational Work and Future Opinions."

    The summary pointed out that the cultural learning campaign launched in the entire army in the past year has achieved great results by May of this year. All units with cultural education as the main training task have completed and overfulfilled the education plan, fundamentally changing the original cultural level of the troops. A large number of cadres and soldiers from worker and peasant backgrounds in the army have reached the level of higher primary school or higher primary school graduates through learning, and many cadres have been trained as junior high school students or junior high school graduates. For example, in the famous "Tashan Hero Regiment," 98 percent of those who participated in the study have reached the level of higher primary school or above in language. Among them, 84.39 percent of cadres at the platoon level and above have graduated from higher primary school in two subjects. The general average score of the all-army cultural examination held in May this year was mostly around 80 points. Individuals who met the excellent standard accounted for 32.7 percent of the examinees.

    The cultural learning campaign in the past year has had a profound impact on all aspects of our army, creating favorable conditions for the regularization and modernization of the troops. The political consciousness and ideological level of the troops have been improved, and the understanding ability of the vast number of lower-level cadres and soldiers has been enhanced. Soldiers can learn many complex weapon names, performance characteristics, and principles faster than in the past. The leadership ability and work efficiency of cadres have also made great progress. They can understand documents and grasp the intentions of higher authorities more accurately and completely. Ninety-two percent of the cadres below the battalion level of the "Tashan Hero Regiment" can make work plans and write simple work summaries.

    In addition, in the cultural and educational work of the past year, a large number of intellectuals who had not participated in the revolution for long have been tempered, reformed, and improved. Among them, many have been rated as model instructors, many have been awarded meritorious service, and many have joined the League or the Party.

    The great harvest of the cultural learning campaign in the troops in the past year proves that the policy of cultural education work in the troops stipulated by the Military Commission is correct and far-sighted, and completely meets the urgent needs of the long-term construction of the troops and the personal requirements of the vast number of cadres and soldiers from worker and peasant backgrounds. Therefore, cultural education has formed a mass, conscious, and creative movement from the very beginning.

    The main experiences of the cultural learning campaign in the troops in the past year are: leaders at all levels must have a clear understanding and great determination to focus on cultural education in order to grasp this central task of great significance. Leaders at all levels must thoroughly examine and summarize experiences so that the movement can develop normally under strong guidance. Leaders must be good at developing the consciousness, enthusiasm, and creativity of the vast number of cadres and soldiers, must proceed from reality, and follow the mass line; in teaching, they must conscientiously study business, and conscientiously and comprehensively implement the education policy of "rapid, practical, and yet regular."

    At the meeting, a detailed discussion was held on how to implement the General Political Department's policies and tasks on cultural education in the future. It was believed that it is necessary to continue to educate the troops to recognize the long-term nature and importance of cultural education work, consolidate it on the basis of existing achievements and experience, persist in it for a long time, prevent and overcome any complacency and slackness, and strive to complete future education tasks.

    Gan Siqi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, gave important instructions at the meeting on the issue of literacy education and cadre cultural education, calling on all cultural instructors and cultural and educational workers to continue to work tirelessly and achieve new achievements in the future.

    At the meeting, Qi Jianhua, Cao Weimin, Chang Qing, Zeng Duanyi and other outstanding cultural and educational workers who have made great contributions to the cultural education of the troops were commended. The meeting ended on August 7th. (Xinhua News Agency)

    人民革命军事委员会总政治部
    召开全军文教工作会议总结成绩和经验
    中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部于七月二十七日召开了全军文化教育工作会议，总结了一年来全军文化教育工作的成绩和经验，并对今后部队文化教育问题，作了研究和讨论。出席这次会议的有各大军区、特种兵、各学校政治部宣传部部长、文化教育科科长和各部队优秀的文化教员代表共一百多人。
    会上，首由各部队宣传部部长汇报了各部队一年来文化教育工作的情况，最后由总政治部宣传部部长刘志坚作了“一年文化教育工作的基本总结和今后意见”的报告。
    总结中指出：一年来在全军展开的文化学习运动，到今年五月为止，取得了很大的成绩，凡是以文化教育为主要训练任务的部队，都完成并超额完成了教育计划，使部队原有的文化水平状况开始起了根本的变化。全军有大批工农出身的干部、战士经过学习已具高小或高小毕业程度，还有许多干部已被培养成初中生或初中毕业生。如著名的“塔山英雄团”参加学习的人员中，百分之九十八都已达到语文高小以上程度，其中排以上干部两门课程高小毕业者占百分之八十四点三九。今年五月举行的全军文化大考试，总平均成绩多在八十分上下。个人成绩合优良标准者占应考人数百分之三十二点七。
    一年来的文化学习运动，对我军各个方面都发生了深远的影响，为部队正规化、现代化建设创造了有利的条件。部队政治觉悟和思想水平提高了，广大下级干部、战士对问题的理解力增强了。战士们对许多复杂的武器名称、性能、原理都比过去能更快地学会了。干部的领导工作能力和工作效率也有了飞跃的进步，他们在理解文件、领会上级意图时都能更加准确和完善。“塔山英雄团”营以下干部百分之九十二都能作工作计划，写简单的工作总结。
    此外，在一年来的文化教育工作中，大量的参加革命不久的知识分子得到了锻炼、改造和提高。其中，有不少人被评为模范教员，不少人立了功，入了团或入了党。
    一年来部队文化学习运动的巨大收获，证明军委所规定的部队文化教育工作的方针是正确的、有远见的，是完全合乎部队长远建设的迫切需要和广大工农出身的干部、战士的切身要求的。因此，文化教育一开始就形成了群众性的、自觉的并富于创造性的运动。
    一年来部队文化学习运动的主要的经验是：各级领导必须对以文教为主的方针有明确认识和巨大决心，才能抓紧这一具有巨大意义的中心工作。各级领导必须深入检查和总结经验，使运动在有力的指导下正常发展。领导者必须善于发挥广大干部、战士的自觉性、积极性与创造性，必须从实际出发，走群众路线；在教学上必须认真钻研业务，切实地全面地执行“速成的、联系实际的、但又是正规的”教育方针。
    会上，对如何贯彻军委总政治部关于今后文化教育的方针与任务作了详细的讨论，认为今后必须继续教育部队认识文化教育工作的长期性与重要性，在已有的成绩和经验的基础上巩固起来，长期地坚持下去，防止与克服任何自满、松懈情绪，努力完成今后的教育任务。
    总政治部副主任甘泗淇在会上对扫盲教育问题与干部文化教育问题作了重要的指示，号召全体文化教员和文教工作者继续努力不懈，在今后取得新的成就。
    会上，并表扬了对部队文化教育有极大贡献的祁建华、曹卫民、常青、曾端仪等优秀的部队文教工作者。会议已于八月七日结束。（新华社）
