    Henan Province's early autumn harvested native products have begun to enter the market. These include the non-staple foods wood ear fungus and daylily, and the medicinal materials honeysuckle and scorpions. Due to the active exchange of goods within and outside the province, state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private merchants in various regions have been conducting purchases, and these products are selling particularly well this year. In order to prevent price gouging and ensure the specifications and quality of the native products, the Henan Provincial State-Owned Trading Company and cooperatives are conscientiously implementing reasonable purchase prices, and are paying attention to educating farmers to improve specifications and product quality during the purchasing process.

    河南初秋收获的土产开始上市
    河南省一些初秋收获的土产开始上市。其中包括副食品木耳、黄花菜和药材金银花、全虫等。由于省内、外物资交流的活跃，国营贸易公司、合作社及各地私商已进行收购，这些产品今年特别畅销。为了防止抬价争购及保证土产的规格、质量，河南省国营贸易公司和合作社认真执行合理的收购价格，并在收购时注意教育农民改进规格、提高产品质量。（新华社）
