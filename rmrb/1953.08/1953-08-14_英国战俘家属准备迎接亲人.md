Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 11th: According to a report in the London "Daily Worker" on the 8th, the families of British prisoners of war repatriated from Korea are happily waiting for their loved ones to return home.

    Mrs. Elizabeth Caulfield, the 53-year-old widow of Private Robert Caulfield, shed tears of joy when she received the telegram at her home in Elland, near Halifax. She said: "I have always lived in hope, and now hope has really come true. I'm going to see him, it's a real relief."

    Iva Langham, the white-haired 73-year-old grandmother of Rifleman Jack Langham, was simply "overjoyed" when she heard the news of her grandson's release. Her neighbors were also very happy, and they have prepared a neighborhood feast for when Jack returns.

    Mrs. A. Dickson said when she heard that her son, Brian Hoyle, was one of the recently released prisoners of war: "I am happier than words can describe." Mrs. Dickson also said that her son told her in a letter that he often went from one POW camp to another with his football team to play matches.

    The mother of Private Peter Huddlestone was moved to tears when she heard the good news. Peter wrote to his mother every eight weeks while in the POW camp, saying in his letters that the Chinese treated him very well and that the food was good.

    英国战俘家属准备迎接亲人
    【新华社柏林十一日电】据伦敦“工人日报”八日报道，在朝鲜被遣返的英国战俘的家属，正快乐地等待着她们的亲人回家。
    兵士罗伯特·考菲尔德的五十三岁寡母伊丽莎白·考菲尔德太太，在哈利法克斯附近艾旁登的家里收到电报时，流出了欣喜的眼泪。她说：“我以前一直活在希望里，现在希望真的实现了。我就要看到他了，这是真正的宽慰。”
    步枪手杰克·兰盖姆的白发苍苍七十三岁祖母伊娃·兰盖姆在听到孙子被释放的消息时简直“欢欣若狂”。她的邻居们也非常高兴，他们已准备好在杰克回来时举行街坊宴会。
    阿·狄克逊太太在听到她的儿子布莱恩·霍伊尔是最近被释放战俘中的一个时说：“我快乐得无法形容。”狄克逊太太又说，她的儿子在信中告诉她，他常常和他的足球队从一个战俘营到另一个战俘营去赛球。
    兵士彼得·赫得尔斯顿的母亲在听到这个好消息时感动得流泪。彼得在战俘营时每八个星期写一封信给他母亲，他在信中说：中国人待他很好，吃的东西也很好。
