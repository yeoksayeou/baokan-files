    State-Owned Factories and Mines in the Southwest Region Further Strengthen Verification and Ratification Work
    More than fifty state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest region are continuing or restarting verification and ratification work in order to further grasp production conditions and improve management standards.
    Since the implementation of production reforms in state-owned factories and mines in the Southwest region, all factories and mines with a relatively solid foundation of original records and relatively fixed products have carried out verification and ratification work. However, the progress of verification and ratification work in the previous period was very uneven, and the results were not solid. Except for a few factories such as Chongqing Electrical Equipment Factory, No. 611 Cotton Mill, Minjiang Power Plant, No. 602 Paper Mill, Chengdu Garment Factory No. 2, Guizhou Cement Plant, and Kunming Smelter, which have achieved certain results and gained some experience, most factories and mines have not done well in verification and ratification work. One type is that although the verification and ratification work was started earlier, it was basically a "mere formality" because the purpose and direction of the verification and ratification were not clear. They made a big splash, but ended very hastily, without seriously solving problems. Norms were established, but they did not play a practical guiding role in production, and no one managed the norms; verification and ratification data were not analyzed, and the work became a formality. Another type is that the verification and ratification work lacked strong leadership, and the methods and steps were not clear, resulting in a long period of detours. For example, the verification and ratification work of the No. 405 Coal Mine did not specify concrete methods and steps, nor did it mobilize the masses. The effect of the verification and ratification was not significant, and key problems such as backward coal mining methods, tunneling not keeping up with mining, and unreasonable labor organization have not been resolved, and the production tasks have not been completed. Another example is that the verification and ratification team of the No. 601 Paper Mill did not cooperate with the central work of the factory, and each went its own way. The leading cadres of the No. 610 Factory did not pay attention to the verification and ratification work, and the publicity and education for the masses was poor. The verification and ratification personnel carried out the work in isolation, and not many key problems in production were identified, and the ones that were identified were not thoroughly solved.
    In order to earnestly do a good job in verification and ratification work, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the Third Industrial and Mining Work Conference in early June, and determined that verification and ratification and discussion of the national plan were the two major central tasks for the factories and mines in the second half of the year. Factories and mines that have already solved some major key problems and are in the process of or preparing to carry out verification and ratification work should continue to mobilize the masses to carry out verification and ratification in repeated discussions of the production plan for the second half of the year, and do a good job in quota setting. Factories and mines that have not yet made significant achievements in grasping key issues and solving key problems should fully mobilize the masses to explore and solve key problems, combine this with the promotion of decisive advanced experience, and actively prepare for verification and ratification work. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also convened a quota work conference on June 25 to study the reasons why the verification and ratification work of various factories and mines had been slow to progress. The conference clearly recognized the direction and steps of future verification and ratification work, and put forward preliminary opinions on the time limit for the completion of verification and ratification work by various factories and mines. In order to gain experience and promote comprehensiveness, the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also determined that six factories, including Kunming Smelter, Majiezi Power Plant, No. 203 Factory, Yunnan Cigarette Factory, No. 22987 Factory, and Kunming Electrical Equipment Factory, should be the focus of verification and ratification. In July, the city's major factories and enterprises comprehensively shifted to centralized verification and ratification, requiring that after verification and ratification, average advanced norms for major products be established in order to further realize planned management.
    According to the experience of factories in the Southwest region that have done a relatively good job in verification and ratification work, the following issues should be paid attention to in order to do a good job in verification and ratification work: (1) Focus on key points in verification and ratification, and start with solving key problems. For example, Kunming Smelter started with the current efficiency problem that has not been solved in the electrolysis workshop, and gradually combined it with solving problems such as quality and raw material consumption quotas. (2) Combine with summarizing and promoting advanced experience. In the verification and ratification process, Chengdu Garment Factory No. 2 used the Kovalev work method to summarize the advanced operating experience of workers, and held technical performances and exhibitions of decomposition diagrams of advanced operating methods. Now 90% of the workers in the factory have mastered advanced operating methods, and the output has more than doubled. (3) Verify, test, and solve problems simultaneously. For example, Guizhou Cement Plant found an advanced operating method of "increasing the charging layer to control the firepower" to replace the old method of "opening and closing the air door to control the firepower." After the successful test, it was fully promoted, increasing the output of the vertical kiln by a quarter. (4) Combine professional verification and ratification with mass self-verification. No. 611 Cotton Mill regarded the discussion of plans, labor competitions, and the establishment of collective contracts as a process of mass self-verification. The verification and ratification personnel of Zhongyuan Paper Mill analyzed and studied the daily written reports with the workers, which achieved good results.

### 西南区国营厂矿进一步加强查定工作

    西南区国营厂矿进一步加强查定工作
    西南区五十几个国营厂矿，为了进一步掌握生产情况，提高管理水平，正继续进行或重新进行查定工作。
    西南区国营厂矿自从进行生产改革以来，凡是原始记录比较有基础、产品比较固定的厂矿都进行了查定工作。但是，前一时期查定工作的进展很不平衡，成绩也不巩固。除重庆电工器材厂、六一一纱厂、岷江电厂、六○二造纸厂、成都被服二厂、贵州水泥厂、昆明冶炼厂等少数工厂取得一定成绩与若干经验外，大多数厂矿的查定工作都还作得不好。一种是查定工作虽然搞得较早，但因为对查定的目的与方针不明确，查定基本上是“走过场”。他们搞得轰轰烈烈，但结束得很草率，没有认真解决问题。定额订出来了，但对生产没有起到实际的指导作用，定额无人管理；查定资料无人分析，工作流于形式。另一种是查定工作缺乏有力领导，方法步骤不明确，走了很长时期的弯路。如四○五煤矿的查定工作，既没有规定具体的方法步骤，又没有发动群众，查定的效果不大，落后的回煤方法、掘进赶不上回采、劳动力组织不合理等关键问题仍然没有得到解决，生产任务没有完成。又如六○一造纸厂查定队不配合工厂中心工作，各行其是。六一○厂领导干部对于查定工作没有重视，对于群众宣传教育差，查定人员孤立地进行工作，生产中的关键问题查出不多，查出的也解决得不彻底。
    为了认真作好查定工作，六月初中共四川省委召开了第三次工矿工作会议，确定查定与讨论国家计划为各厂矿下半年的两大中心工作。凡已解决若干重大关键问题，正在进行或准备进行查定工作的厂矿，应继续发动群众在反复讨论下半年生产计划中进行查定，做好定额工作。抓关键、解决关键问题还没有做出显著成绩的厂矿，应充分发动群众发掘和解决关键问题，结合推广有决定意义的先进经验，积极准备查定工作。中共重庆市委也在六月二十五日召开了定额工作会议，研究了各厂矿查定工作迟迟不前的原因，明确地认识了今后查定工作的方针步骤，对各厂矿完成查定工作的期限提出了初步意见。中共昆明市委为了取得经验，推动全面，也确定以昆明冶炼厂、马街子发电厂、二○三厂、云南纸烟厂、二二九八七厂及昆明电工器材厂等六个厂为重点进行查定。七月份，全市主要工厂企业全面转入集中查定，要求经过查定，订出主要产品的平均先进定额，以便进一步实现计划管理。
    根据西南区查定工作作得比较好的工厂的经验，要作好查定工作，应注意以下一些问题：（一）重点查定，从解决关键问题入手。如昆明冶炼厂从电解车间一直没有解决的电流效率问题入手，逐步结合解决质量和原材料消耗定额等问题。（二）结合总结与推广先进经验。成都被服二厂在查定中，用郭瓦廖夫工作法总结出工人的先进操作经验，举行技术表演与先进操作方法分解图展览，现在该厂已有百分之九十的工人掌握了先进操作法，产量提高了一倍多。（三）边查、边试验、边解决问题。如贵州水泥厂找到了以“增加加料层控制火力”的先进操作法代替“开关风门控制火力”的老办法，试验成功后，全面推广，使立窑产量增加四分之一。（四）专业性查定与群众自查相结合。六一一纱厂把讨论计划、劳动竞赛、订立集体合同等工作，当作群众自查的过程。中元纸厂查定员把每天写实情况与工人共同分析研究，收到很好效果。
