    New Cotton from Hubei, Henan and Other Provinces Will Soon Be Available in Large Quantities; Cooperatives in Most Areas Have Prepared for Cotton Purchasing
    In Hubei, Henan, and other provinces, new cotton will soon be available in large quantities. Supply and marketing cooperatives in most areas have prepared for the purchase of new cotton.
    In Hubei Province, most of the 8.4 million mu of cotton fields are expected to yield a bumper harvest. According to the current situation, Hanchuan area is expected to increase production by 30% to 40% compared to last year, and general areas are also expected to increase production by more than 10%. With the widespread increase in cotton production, cooperatives in various regions in August successively held cotton purchasing personnel meetings to discuss and arrange cotton purchasing work. Learning from the lesson of insufficient preparation for cotton purchasing last year, cooperatives in various regions have expanded or increased their efforts this year in terms of purchasing plans, manpower, and funds. In order to implement the policy of "better prices for better cotton," cooperatives at all levels have paid attention to training grading personnel in advance this year. The Xinzhou County Cooperative Federation selected 40 grading personnel from various district cooperatives to hold short-term training classes. Hanchuan County has 42 grading personnel who have undergone training. In addition, cooperatives in various parts of Hubei Province have added and repaired cotton purchasing equipment and warehouses. In order to quickly gin the purchased seed cotton into lint, cooperatives in various regions have investigated cotton processing capacity and signed processing contracts with some ginneries. Cooperatives in various regions have prepared or are preparing a large number of production and living materials, ready to combine purchasing with vigorous supply. Hanchuan Cooperative has prepared to supply grain, oil, salt and other materials to cotton producing areas, and other agricultural tools, general merchandise, and printed cloth have been placed on the shelves. This year, cotton is coming onto the market quickly in Hubei Province. The Dangyang County Cooperative began purchasing new cotton on August 10, and the number of cotton sold by farmers is increasing daily. The Cihua Collection Cooperative in the county purchased 800 jin of cotton on the first day, and the purchase reached more than 1,600 jin on the third day.
    All counties in Henan Province produce cotton, among which the Luoyang, Anyang, Shangqiu, Xinxiang, and Zhengzhou special districts are famous cotton producing areas in the country. This year, the cotton in these areas is growing well. Many farmers have learned from the advanced experience of Soviet cotton close planting and improved their farming techniques, and the actual output will be higher than last year.
    In April of this year, the Henan Provincial Cooperative Federation, based on the experience of purchasing cotton last year and the distribution of cotton fields this year, conducted appropriate rectification and adjustment of the original purchasing institutions. In June and July, the county cooperatives and the Henan Provincial Fiber Inspection Bureau conducted more than 20 days of training for cotton collection staff. More than 2,000 cotton grading personnel and accounting personnel have been trained. Cooperatives in various regions have also made full preparations for the safety equipment for collecting and storing cotton. The 60 purchasing stations in the Anyang Special District have installed 54 fire extinguishers, 92 water tanks, and a large number of water buckets and sandbags. Learning from the lesson of wasting funds due to inaccurate planning in cotton collection last year, cooperatives in various regions have conducted a more serious investigation and research on the cotton field area, cotton output, and historical market conditions in their respective regions, and formulated purchasing plans from bottom to top according to the needs of the national textile industry.

    湖北河南等省新棉即将大量上市
    大部地区合作社已作好购棉准备工作
    湖北、河南等省，新棉即将大量上市。大部地区的供销合作社已作好收购新棉的准备工作。
    湖北省今年八百四十万亩棉田大部分可获丰收。根据目前情况看来，汉川一带比去年增产三成至四成，一般地区亦增产一成以上。各地供销合作社在棉花普遍增产的情况下，八月份都先后召开了棉花收购人员会议，讨论和布置了购棉工作。各地合作社接受去年购棉准备不充分的教训，今年在收购计划、人力、资金等方面都比去年有所扩大或增加。为了贯彻“优花优价”政策，今年各级合作社都注意事先训练验级人员。新洲县合作社联合社抽调各区社四十个验级人员举办了短期训练班。汉川县今年有四十二个验级人员先后经过了训练。此外，湖北省各地合作社都添置和修补了购棉用具和仓库等。为了把收购的籽棉尽快轧成皮棉，各地合作社已对棉花加工力量作了调查，并和有些轧花厂签订了加工合同。各地合作社都已准备好或正在准备大量生产资料和生活资料，准备结合收购大力供应。汉川合作社已准备好供应产棉区的粮食、油、盐等物资，其他农具、百货、花布已摆上货架。今年湖北省棉花上市很快，当阳县合作社八月十日已开始购新棉，农民售棉数量日渐增加，该县慈化集上合作社第一天购棉八百斤，第三天收购达一千六百多斤。
    河南省各县都产棉花，其中洛阳、安阳、商邱、新乡、郑州等专区是全国著名的棉花产区。今年这些地区的棉花生长良好。许多农民由于学习了苏联棉花密植的先进经验，提高了耕作技术，实际产量将比去年提高。
    今年四月间，河南省合作社联合社就根据去年收购棉花的经验及今年棉田分布情况，对原有的收购机构进行适当的整顿和调整。六、七两月各县合作社和河南省纤维检验局，对收棉工作人员又分别进行二十多天的训练。经过训练的棉花分级人员和会计人员已有二千多人。各地合作社对收存棉花的安全设备，也都作了充分准备。安阳专区的六十个收购站，已设置了五十四台灭火器、九十二个水缸及大量的水桶和沙袋。各地合作社接受去年收棉因计划不确造成资金浪费的教训，今年各地合作社对所属地区的棉田面积、棉花产量及历年上市情况都进行了比较认真的调查研究，并根据国家纺织工业的需要由下而上制订了收购计划。（据新华社讯）
