    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 6th: TASS, Düsseldorf: According to the German News Agency, the Central Secretariat of the German Communist Party issued a communiqué on the congress held on August 3rd. The communiqué stated: "On August 3rd, the Chairman of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, reported to the German Communist Party Central Secretariat's congress on the situation of the 15th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), which was of great significance.
    The German Communist Party Central Secretariat unanimously agreed with the decision entitled 'The Party's New Policy and Tasks,' which was adopted at the 15th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.
    This new policy resulted from the decisions made by the Politburo of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic on June 9th and June 12th, 1953. This policy greatly contributes to solving the pressing problems of our people—the peaceful restoration of German unity on a democratic basis.
