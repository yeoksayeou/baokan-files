Reader's Letters Summary

It's Inappropriate to Stage Operas and Relax Production During the Tense Stage of Drought Resistance in Rural Areas

(I)
Jiang Yingbei from Yueyang, Hunan, writes: In Xidong, Sanlang, and Jilin townships of Huarong County's Fifth District, old Huaguxi operas with unmodified content have been performed in rotation since late June. Now, when the local drought resistance work has entered a tense stage, the masses in these townships cannot carry out drought resistance work during the day because they are watching operas at night, and the weeds in the fields are not being hoed either. Nearby Hengshan, Xin'an and other townships are also affected, with many young men and women rushing out to watch operas at night. Some people in Hengshan Township even stay up all night, rushing to write operas in preparation for future performances, and mobilizing the masses to build stages, calling away those who operate waterwheels, neglecting the cracked fields. It is said that "dry roots during jointing are like not planting at all." Neglecting drought resistance work will inevitably seriously affect the future harvest, and this situation should be corrected in a timely manner.

(II)
Le Faxiang from Yichun County, Jiangxi, writes: Currently, the weather is dry, and drought resistance work in rural areas is entering a tense stage; however, the masses in Layuan Village, Latangxia Village, and Shezhou Village in Yisi Township of our county are relaxing their drought resistance work at this time, spending a lot of manpower and financial resources to invite opera troupes to perform. Since the first month of this year, some people in Layuan Village have spent twelve dan of grain to hire a master to teach opera, often teaching until late at night. Recently, the whole village collected more than four buckets of rice and invited people to perform opera for a day and a night on the 15th of July. Many people from nearby came to watch. In addition, Latangxia Village and Shezhou Village also collected rice to invite opera troupes to perform. The areas of Latangxia Village and Shezhou Village are now threatened by drought, and many fields are dry and cracked. It is inappropriate for the local masses to neglect actively resisting drought and waste a lot of labor by watching operas. At the same time, it is indeed a waste to spend a lot of grain and rice to invite opera troupes to perform when the rural areas are in the transitional period between crops. It is hoped that relevant leading departments can correct this phenomenon in a timely manner.

The Jixi Mining Bureau Drilling Company Should Truly Value Hydrogeological Work

A reader from the Geological Section of the Jixi Mining Bureau Drilling Company writes: The Jixi Mining Bureau Drilling Company does not pay enough attention to hydrogeological work. Mine hydrogeological data is an important part of mine design data; the Beipiao Mining Bureau once encountered quicksand after digging a well because no hydrogeological survey was conducted in advance, and work was suspended halfway. However, none of the sixty boreholes recently drilled by our mining bureau at the Chengzihe Coal Mine for opening vertical shafts provided simple hydrogeological data. The drilling team wants to do borehole pumping tests, but there is no water pump, and the work cannot be carried out. We asked the section chief and manager for help, but they shirked responsibility to each other, and no one cared about it. As a result, the mine design data has been completed, but the hydrogeological data has still not been provided. This will affect the smooth progress of the design work.

The leadership of our mining bureau has consistently not valued hydrogeological work. We still do not know how much hydrogeological work we will have this year and when it should be done. We have often found that simple hydrogeological data is not well-done in the past and have repeatedly reported it to the leading comrades; however, the leadership has never taken concrete measures to improve this work. Only when the higher-level leading organs ask our mining bureau for hydrogeological data, the leading comrades of our bureau will rush the staff to put together tools to do it temporarily. It is hoped that the Jixi Mining Bureau will quickly correct this error and truly value hydrogeological work in the future.

The Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau's Newly Built Workers' Dormitories Collect Rent But No One is Responsible for Repairs

Xiao Lian from the Supervision Office of the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau writes: The Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau built a new batch of workers' dormitories last year. This batch of dormitories was constructed by the original Nanchang Construction Team under the Engineering Department of the Shanghai Railway Administration and was completed in February this year. Because the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau was transferred to the leadership of the Guangzhou Railway Administration this year, these houses should be inspected and taken over by the Nanchang Construction Section of the Engineering Department of the Guangzhou Railway Administration after completion. Due to the poor quality of the houses, leaking roofs, tilting walls, and insufficient cement on the ground, the Nanchang Construction Section believed that they did not meet the standards and did not accept them; and sent the acceptance report to the Engineering Department of the Shanghai Railway Administration for research and handling. The Shanghai Railway Administration transferred all the personnel of the original Nanchang Construction Team before the house acceptance procedures were completed; and has not responded to the Nanchang Construction Section's issues of poor house quality. Later, the Nanchang Construction Section neither urged the Shanghai Railway Administration nor reported to the Guangzhou Railway Administration, so the problem has been delayed until now and has not been resolved.

Now, many workers have moved into these houses, but the problems are increasing. Especially when it rains, the roofs leak, the walls shed soil, and air bubbles appear on the walls. Employees have repeatedly asked the Nanchang Construction Section to repair the houses. The Nanchang Construction Section said: "The houses have not been formally accepted, we cannot repair them, the construction team should be responsible." The employees went to the construction team, and the construction team said: "The previous Nanchang Construction Team has long been transferred to Shanghai; we are the Second Construction Team of the Guangzhou Railway Administration and have nothing to do with this batch of houses." No one cares about the residents' requests to repair the houses, but the Nanchang Construction Section sends people to collect rent every month.

The state has spent a lot of money to build workers' dormitories, but some people are taking an irresponsible bureaucratic attitude towards state property and workers' lives; this is not allowed. It is hoped that the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government will promptly inspect this matter and order the relevant units to be responsible for repairing the houses to ensure the safety of workers' housing.

The Central Film School's Film Processing Specialization Course Lacks a Clear Purpose

The Class Committee of Class A of the Central Film School's Film Processing Specialization Course writes: Although our school underwent the adjustment of university departments in 1952, the teaching effect has been very poor in the past year because the school does not have a clear understanding of the purpose of running the specialization course, has no practical teaching plan, and has not made sufficient preparations for starting classes.

When our school enrolled students in 1952, it listed many courses that students were required to study in one year in the enrollment brochure, but in reality, we have only learned some general film knowledge and physics and chemistry in the past year; this is very inappropriate for a specialization course. The school has neither a fixed teaching plan nor sufficient preparations for starting classes, coupled with a lack of teachers, so the courses for each semester are caught and put together at the last minute. Some courses that have already started had to be temporarily changed because there were no teachers. For example, the course "Film Processing Technology" was originally scheduled to be offered in the second semester, but because there was no teacher, it was changed to "Organic Chemistry," which was originally scheduled to be studied in the third semester; and the teacher of the "Organic Chemistry" course did not have time to prepare lessons, and could not continue teaching after the fourth week, so he had to change to "General Chemistry" again. Many teachers also have a very unclear understanding of their teaching tasks and teaching purposes, and do not know what kind of people they should train students into; some teachers even said to the students at the beginning of the class: "What do you want to learn, I will teach you." Our school is also very chaotic in terms of the academic system. The school divides students who graduated from junior high school and students who graduated from high school into two classes, Class A and Class B (both called specialization courses). Although the students in the two classes have different levels and different requirements, the teaching content is basically the same. We have repeatedly reported the above problems to the school leaders, but they have not been paid attention to. We request the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government and the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government to jointly find a way to solve this problem.

Radio Stations Should Be Cautious When Broadcasting Opera Programs

Gao Jinglu from the People's Supervision Office of the Ministry of Railways of the Central Government writes: On the evening of the 12th of last month, the Third Program of Beijing People's Broadcasting Station broadcasted the opera "The Death of Wu Dalang" performed by the Heping Peking Opera Troupe. Some of the lines of Wang Po in the play were extremely unserious. For example, when she winned over Pan Jinlian, she said: "I'll take you to see movies and go to the park..."; when she drew together the improper relationship between Ximen Qing and Pan Jinlian, she said: "I'll be your wedding host," and so on. I think it is wrong and unserious for Wang Po to talk nonsense like this, deliberately flaunting gimmicks, and randomly using modern terms to cater to the backward psychology of some audiences and win applause. Therefore, in addition to suggesting that the troupe revise the play when performing it, I also hope that the radio station should strictly review the programs it broadcasts and not recklessly broadcast bad programs.

Reply from Beijing People's Broadcasting Station

The Editorial Department of Beijing People's Broadcasting Station writes: Comrade Gao Jinglu's comments on our station are correct. Due to the rough work style in our station's broadcasting work, when broadcasting the Peking Opera "The Death of Wu Dalang," we did not pay attention to the fact that the attitude of the actor playing Wang Po was not serious enough, which caused a bad influence among the audience and caused losses to the work. We must be more careful in our work in the future to avoid similar mistakes from happening again.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    农村抗旱紧张阶段不该演戏放松生产
    （一）
    湖南岳阳江应北来信：华容县五区锡栋、三朗、济林等乡，从六月下旬起，轮流演唱内容未加修改的旧花鼓戏。现在正值当地抗旱工作进入紧张阶段的时候，这几乡群众却因连夜看戏，不能在白天进行抗旱工作，田里的草也不锄了。附近的横山、新安等乡也受到影响，不少青年男女晚上都赶出去看戏。横山乡甚至有人整夜不睡觉，赶着写戏准备将来上演，又发动群众搭戏台，把车水的人都喊了去，田干裂了缝却不管。目前禾正装胎，俗话说：“结蔸干胎，犹如不栽”，忽视抗旱工作，必然会严重影响将来的收成，这种情况应及时加以纠正。
    （二）
    江西宜春县乐发祥来信：目前天气干燥，农村中抗旱工作正进入紧张阶段；但是我县一寺乡腊源村、腊塘下村及射鵃乡的射鵃村等地群众，却在这时放松抗旱工作，花了很多人力、财力请人演戏。腊源村自今年正月起，就有人花了十二担谷子请师傅来教戏，常常教到深更半夜。最近全村又凑了四桶多米，在七月十五日那天，请人来唱了一天一夜的戏。附近有很多人都赶来看。此外，腊塘下村与射鵃村也都凑了米请人来唱戏。而腊塘下村、射鵃村等地区，现已受到旱灾的威胁，不少田地都干得开了坼，当地群众不积极抗旱，却因看戏而浪费很多人工，是不应该的；同时农村中现在正是青黄不接的时候，花很多谷米请人唱戏，也确是浪费。希有关领导部门，能及时纠正这种现象。
    鸡西矿务局钻探公司应该切实重视水文地质工作
    鸡西矿务局钻探公司地质科一读者来信：鸡西矿务局钻探公司对水文地质工作很不重视。矿井水文地质资料是矿井设计资料中的重要部分；北票矿务局曾因事先未作水文调查，掘井后遇到流砂，中途停工。可是，我们矿务局最近在城子河煤矿为开竖井而打的六十个钻孔，都没有提出简易水文地质资料。钻探队要做钻孔抽水试验，可是没有水泵，工作无法进行。我们请科长、经理设法，但他们却互相推诿，谁也不管这事。结果矿井设计资料已经完成，而水文地质资料仍然没有提出。这样，就会影响设计工作的顺利进行。
    我们矿务局领导方面对水文地质工作的不重视是一贯的。我们至今还不知道今年有多少水文地质工作的任务，应该在什么时候做。我们过去经常发现简易水文地质资料作得不好，多次向领导同志反映；可是领导方面始终没有采取具体措施来改进这方面的工作。只有在上级领导机关向我们矿务局要水文地质资料时，我局领导同志才抓着职工临时拼凑工具赶做。希望鸡西矿务局迅速纠正这个错误，今后切实重视水文地质工作。
    南昌铁路分局新建工人宿舍有人收房租却没人负责修理
    南昌铁路分局监察室效廉来信：南昌铁路分局去年新盖一批工人宿舍。这批宿舍系由上海铁路管理局工程处所属原南昌建筑队承建，在今年二月完工。因为南昌铁路分局今年改属广州铁路管理局领导后，这批房屋完工后也就应由广州铁路管理局工务处南昌建筑段验收接管。由于房屋质量不好，屋顶漏雨，墙壁倾斜，地面水泥分量不足，南昌建筑段认为不合标准，没有接收；并随将验收报告送请上海铁路管理局工务处研究处理。上海局却不等房屋验收手续办完，就把原南昌建筑队人员全部调走；而对南昌建筑段提出的房屋质量低劣问题也一直不作答复。以后，南昌建筑段既没有催问过上海局，又不向广州局报告，以致问题拖延到现在仍未解决。
    现在，这批房屋已经有许多工人搬进去住了，但毛病却越来越多。尤其在下雨时，屋顶漏雨，顶壁往下掉土，墙壁冒气泡。职工纷纷要求南昌建筑段修理房屋。南昌建筑段却说：“房屋未经正式验收，我们不能修，应由建筑队负责。”职工们找建筑队，建筑队说：“以前的南昌建筑队早就被调到上海了；我们是广州局的第二建筑队，与这批房屋没有关系。”住户们修理房屋的要求没人管，但是每月的房租却由南昌建筑段派人来收取。
    国家花了很多钱修建工人宿舍，可是有些人却对国家财产和工人生活采取不负责任的官僚主义态度；这是不能允许的。希望中央人民政府铁道部迅速对这件事进行检查，并责成有关单位负责修理房屋，以保障工人的居住安全。
    中央电影学校洗印专修科办学目的性不明确
    中央电影学校洗印专修科甲班班委会来信：我们学校虽经过一九五二年高等学校院系调整，但由于校方对办专修科的目的性认识不明确，教学无切实的计划，开课又无充分准备，因此一年来教学效果很差。
    一九五二年我校招生时，曾在招生简章上列出了很多要学生在一年内学习的课程，但实际上一年来我们只学了一些一般的电影常识和物理、化学；作为一个专修科来说，这是很不恰当的。学校既无一定教学计划，开课又无充分准备，加上师资缺乏，因此每学期的课程都是现抓现凑。有些已开的课因为没有教师，只好临时调换。如第二学期原应开“洗印技术”一科，但因为没有教师，改开原应在第三学期学的“有机化学”；而“有机化学”一科的教师又来不及备课，到第四周实在没法教下去了，只得再改开“普通化学”。不少教师对自己的教学任务和教学目的的认识也很不明确，不知道应该将学生培养成怎样的人；有的教师甚至在开课时对同学说：“你们愿意学什么，我就教什么。”我校在学制上也很混乱。学校把初中毕业的同学和高中毕业的同学分成甲、乙两班（都叫做专修科），虽然两班学生的程度不同、要求不同，但教学内容基本上是一样的。我们曾一再将以上问题向学校领导方面反映，但却一直没受到重视。我们要求中央高等教育部和中央文化部共同设法解决这个问题。
    电台转播戏曲节目时要慎重
    中央铁道部人民监察室高景鲁来信：上月十二日晚，北京人民广播电台第三台曾转播了和平京剧团演唱的“武大郎之死”一剧。剧中王婆一角的某些道白，极不严肃。如她拢络潘金莲时说：“我带你去看电影、逛公园……”；给西门庆和潘金莲拉扯不正当关系时说：“我给你俩当主婚人”等等。我认为像王婆这样信口开河，故意卖弄噱头，乱用现代名词，以迎合某些观众的落后心理，博取掌声的做法是错误的，是不严肃的。因此除建议该团演出该剧时予以修正外，并希望电台对于播送的节目，应严格审查，不要轻率地播送不好的节目。
    北京人民广播电台的复信
    北京人民广播电台编辑部来信：高景鲁同志对本台所提意见是正确的。由于本台转播工作尚存在粗枝大叶的作风，转播京剧“武大郎之死”时，未注意到饰演王婆的态度不够严肃，以致在听众中产生不好的影响，使工作遭到损失，今后我们在工作中一定要细致些，以免再有类似错误发生。
