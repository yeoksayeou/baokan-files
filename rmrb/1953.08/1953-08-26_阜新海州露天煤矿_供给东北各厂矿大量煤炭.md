    Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine
    Supplies Large Amounts of Coal to Factories and Mines in Northeast China
    The Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine, which was put into operation not long ago, has supplied large amounts of coal to many major factories, mines, and economic construction departments in Northeast China. Because of its good quality, the coal from the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine is widely welcomed by users.
    On July 1st, the day the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine was put into operation, the first batch of coal produced was supplied to Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Subsequently, the supply was expanded to more than 360 important factories, mines, and basic construction departments in Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, and Shanhaiguan.
    At present, although the open-pit mine has not yet been mined to the best coal seams, the quality of the coal has reached a considerably high level. In July, the ash content of raw coal was 5.24 percentage points lower than the national standard; coal preparation has also basically met national requirements. In order to understand users' opinions on the quality of coal, the Fuxin Mining Bureau recently sent an investigation team to conduct a focused survey of more than 150 major users. Users generally expressed satisfaction with the quality of coal produced by the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine.

    阜新海州露天煤矿
    供给东北各厂矿大量煤炭
    不久前投入生产的阜新海州露天煤矿，已经把大量煤炭供给了东北许多主要工厂、矿山和经济建设部门。因为质量好，海州露天矿的煤得到用户的普遍欢迎。
    今年七月一日阜新海州露天矿投入生产的当天，首先以出产的第一批煤供给了鞍山钢铁公司。接着，又扩大供应了沈阳、大连、哈尔滨和山海关等地的三百六十多个重要工厂、矿山和基本建设部门。
    目前，露天矿虽然还没开采到最好的煤层，但煤的质量已达到相当高的水平。七月份，原煤的灰分率比国家规定的标准降低了五点二四；选煤也基本上达到了国家要求。为了了解用户对煤炭质量的意见，不久以前，阜新矿务局曾派出一个调查组，有重点地调查了一百五十多个主要用户。用户们对海州露天矿所产煤的质量，普遍表示满意。
