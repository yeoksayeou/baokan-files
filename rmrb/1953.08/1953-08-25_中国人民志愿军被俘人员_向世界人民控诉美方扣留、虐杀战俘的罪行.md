(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 24th) Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war are denouncing the U.S. side's atrocities of forcibly detaining prisoners of war and killing prisoners of war to the peace-loving and just people of the world. On the afternoon of August 10th at 3:00 PM, they submitted a copy of the ten-thousand-word indictment to representatives of the joint Red Cross group in Mun San.

The indictment states: Let us use our personal experiences to further expose the barbaric essence behind the U.S. imperialists' disguised "democracy" and "humanity." No matter how many lies "Voice of America" and all the propaganda tools of Wall Street fabricate, they cannot cover up the bloody atrocities of U.S. imperialism. The indictment points out: In fact, what is stated here is only a very small part of the U.S. side's atrocities.

The indictment states: The enemy's persecution and massacre, and all kinds of brutal methods, cannot obliterate our patriotic and peace-loving fighting will. We will never forget this blood debt, and it will encourage us to fight more resolutely for the construction of our motherland and the defense of peace in the future.

The indictment is accompanied by a memorandum, which describes the various atrocities committed by the U.S. military against Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war:

	I.	Injured prisoners of war who had lost their ability to fight became live targets for the U.S. military: On May 28, 1951, in an air-raid shelter east of the North Han River on the eastern front, more than 600 of our army's wounded and sick personnel were living. When the U.S. military arrived, they immediately drove these wounded and sick out of the shelter and shot them with machine guns. A small number of seriously wounded and sick who could not move and did not come out were bombed to death by the U.S. military with grenades. Among them, Hu Tingsheng and Huang Ming were injured but survived the machine-gun扫射.

	II.	Extracting intelligence and violent forced confessions were the first things we encountered after being captured. No one who was captured could easily escape this ordeal. The interrogation agencies were the U.S. Far East Military Intelligence Bureau, code-named G-2, the Psychological Warfare Department of the U.S. Far East Command Headquarters, and the Far East Branch of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After Comrade Chu Shengmao, a soldier from a volunteer army unit, was wounded and captured, he was immediately transported to the front interrogation office. The U.S. military forced Chu to admit that he was an officer and tried to extract intelligence. When Chu refused to reveal anything, the U.S. military immediately tied Chu's two thumbs to a telephone and subjected him to electric shock torture. Chu fainted. The U.S. military splashed him awake with cold water and asked him again. This electric shock torture was applied four or five times in a row, but Chu remained unyielding.

	III.	Sick and wounded prisoners of war were victims of U.S. medical experiments. The prisoner-of-war hospital set up by the U.S. military was a disguised slaughterhouse: U.S. military doctors at the Busan prisoner-of-war hospital once told individual sick and wounded prisoners of war: "We will give you the latest medicines that have not yet been used in the United States." A righteous doctor once told prisoner of war Li Yao: "What can I do? My superiors told me to do this." He revealed that new medicines from the United States were first tested on prisoners of war before being proven safe. In addition, U.S. military medical personnel deliberately turned prisoners of war into cripples. Prisoner of war Gao Shangde saw a comrade named Wu Shouhua in the hospital who was only injured in the back, but the U.S. military cut off his arm and made him a cripple. Many wounded prisoners became seriously disabled after being treated by U.S. military doctors.

	IV.	Living maltreatment and starvation: The food rations issued to us by the detention authorities every day were mixed wheat and barley with bran. In our motherland, these were only used to feed livestock. Sometimes they issued rice with green mold and flour that was pounded into lumps. In terms of quantity, each person only received about one pound per day. The vegetables were cabbage with yellow leaves and radishes that were too old to chew. Meat was even more difficult to see. Before the first half of 1952, each person was given an average of only one-quarter of a pound of meat. From the second half of the year until now, we have not tasted meat at all. The detention authorities only threw us some fish that were as dry as hard bark and full of maggots. Salt was often in short supply. Coal and firewood were never issued enough. The rice was often cooked half-raw, so every prisoner of war lived in hunger.

The detention authorities also tortured us by not providing enough drinking water. In 1951, the "72nd" regiment of Chinese prisoners of war on Geoje Island, which had more than 12,000 people, had only one water pipe with a half-inch diameter. There was not enough water to drink. We were thirsty, our mouths were on fire, and our eyes were blurred. We had no choice but to dig a small pit and drink sewage, but the U.S. military used the excuse that "we were digging pits to escape" and shot and killed one prisoner of war.

Since we were captured, the U.S. military used bayonets to force us to confiscate all our clothes and belongings, and then issued a set of tattered U.S. military clothes and a rough, hard gray blanket. This was all the clothing that the U.S. military supplied to us. In winter, regardless of wind or snow, we still wore this set of clothes, and we were forced to do hard labor in the snow and rain. In July 1951, on Geoje Island, Chinese prisoners of war were forced to change into a set of red shorts and clothes (after taking them off to wash, they had to put them on wet or wait naked for them to dry). When the snow was falling in December, we still wore this set of shorts and clothes. Many people froze to death, and even more suffered from severe joint pain.

The prisoners of war could only occupy four to five inches of damp land on average at night. We had never seen beds or floors, and even straw mats were rare. People pressed against each other, and the wounded and sick groaned all night long. In June 1951, in Busan, 250 people lived in a U.S. military tent. It was filled with water in the heavy rain. We squatted in the mud all night, and scabies, rheumatism, and prisoners of war were inseparable.

Since we were captured, each person's weight has decreased by an average of 40 pounds. Those who became night blind due to lack of oil and vitamins accounted for 37% of our total, and those who suffered from paralysis and joint pain due to cold and dampness accounted for 23%.

	V.	The detention authorities often beat, scolded, insulted, and enslaved prisoners of war. They used rifle butts, wooden sticks, whips, and the tips of their shoes to drive us in and out like livestock, forced us to do hard labor all day long, and beat and kicked us if we were slightly dissatisfied. Even when they felt bored, they would insult us to amuse themselves.

We were not allowed to rest during long hours of hard labor. If we were physically unable to do so, we would be beaten. In November 1951, on a snowy night, the U.S. military forced Chinese prisoners of war on Geoje Island to do hard labor at sea, carrying sand and breaking rocks. Many people were beaten to death because they were physically unable to do so. At least two-thirds of the people in our two prisoner-of-war camps had to go to the seaside to unload ships, repair roads, and level the ground, and were forced to clean the U.S. military's station. On March 23, 1952, when we went to the warehouse to do hard labor, the U.S. military forced two people to carry a box weighing more than 400 pounds with bayonets. Because they were not strong enough, they only lifted it half a meter high and then lost their grip due to lack of strength. One of them was injured in the leg, but the U.S. military said that they had disobeyed orders and punished them with a day of breaking stones the next day, and did not give them food.

	VI.	The U.S. military used poison gas bombs, which are strictly prohibited by international law, to detain prisoners of war and openly declared that this was legal. In June 1952, after the U.S. military used poison gas bombs, Brigadier General Bonner, the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp commander, said: "It is legal to use poison gas bombs to suppress prisoners of war." On the surface, they used tear gas bombs, but in reality, all kinds of poison gas bombs were used. On June 29, 1952, on Geoje Island, Captain Brooks personally led the U.S. military to surround the prisoner-of-war camp and asked us to move immediately within five minutes, but when we walked, they said that we were walking too slowly, and then ordered the throwing of poison gas bombs. There were four or five hundred bombs thrown, and the whole camp was filled with thick smoke, and the poison gas spread for three hours. In mid-July 1952, one day, a U.S. armed infantry platoon entered the No. 7 camp to conduct an inspection. After the U.S. military left, they used the excuse that the prisoners of war were singing and suddenly broke into the camp, releasing a large number of tear gas bombs and spraying erosive powder, resulting in more than 20 serious injuries and more than 10 minor injuries. Five or six people lost their sight due to poisoning. On August 15, 1952, we held a celebration of the anniversary of Japan's fascist surrender as usual. The U.S. military authorities said: "Japan is our friend, and it is not allowed to commemorate this holiday. Commemoration is illegal." A large number of troops were dispatched to the ten camps, releasing five or six thousand tear gas bombs and a large amount of erosive powder. Before the prisoners of war returning to their country left the prisoner-of-war camp, they were continuously attacked by poison gas bombs.

	VII.	Using special agents to control and carry out massacres to achieve the purpose of detaining prisoners of war. The U.S. military authorities sent special agents Wang Shunqing, Wang Futian, Liu Bingzhang, Li Qi, Ying Xiangyun, Wang Jiati, Fang Shi, and Xiong Guang, who had been trained at the U.S. Far East Intelligence Bureau in Tokyo, to prisoner-of-war camps to serve as regimental commanders, security captains, so-called prisoner-of-war "representatives," and heads of CIE schools, to organize "security teams" and force people to tattoo themselves and sign their names. The U.S. military authorities gave these special agents clubs, whips, and sharp knives engraved with the letters "US" to violently control prisoners of war who loved their motherland. Many people were given cold water, electrocuted, beaten, hung up, cut, and even had their hearts dug out. All kinds of cruel tortures were used, and the sound of whips and moans could be heard everywhere day and night. The U.S. military authorities also colluded with the Taiwan Chiang bandits, who dispatched 104 special agents from Taiwan, including special agents from the Kuomintang Military Statistics Bureau. In 1951, they opened a so-called "CIE school" in the prisoner-of-war camp and forced them to carry out "political education," prohibited freedom of belief, and were not allowed to sing songs from their motherland. They also installed loudspeakers in the camp and broadcast deceptive propaganda every day, slandering and vilifying the Communist Party, the People's Republic of China, and all peace-loving democratic countries, and threatened prisoners of war in an attempt to achieve the purpose of detaining prisoners of war. Special agents in religious clothing lured prisoners of war in the name of God, Jesus, and "Tathagata." After seeing that this set of poisoning policies had failed in front of the prisoners of war, the U.S. military authorities immediately ordered their lackeys to replace enticement with violence and carried out "screening" on April 8, 1952, carrying out a large-scale massacre and creating the "April 8" massacre.

The special agents forced prisoners of war to tattoo themselves. Han Zhi, Zhang Chengrui, Jiang Yun, and others were subjected to 69 tortures for insisting on not tattooing themselves or signing their names. Many people were tied up and forced to tattoo themselves. On the eve of the "screening," the special agents held sticks and knives and forced those who had not tattooed themselves to stand in line outside, and several people pressed them down and forced them to tattoo themselves.

In order to force prisoners of war not to return to their country, the U.S. military authorities instructed special agents to use inhuman torture. Comrade Kong Fanrong insisted on returning to his country during the April 8 "screening." The special agents filled the rubber tube of a fire extinguisher with chili water and poured it into his anus, then pressed his stomach to squeeze the water out. Kong fainted several times as a result.

On the eve of the April 8 "screening," no one knows how many people in the 86th and 72nd regiments died under sticks and knives. Yang Wenhua was the first to be beaten to death. The special agents dug out Yang Wenhua's heart with a knife and held it in their hands to intimidate people, saying: "Look, this is what happens to those who want to return to their country." The U.S. military laughed and gave a thumbs up.

	VIII. Arbitrary detention and massacre of prisoners of war. On June 30, 1952, prisoner of war Wang Fang was detained in prison for no reason and severely beaten and interrogated. In July, Chinese prisoner-of-war representatives Sun Zhengguan and Zhang Zeshi, who were taken by the U.S. military by car to the 76th camp to attend a meeting, were detained and sentenced for no reason. On the evening of October 20, the U.S. military suddenly entered the No. 5 camp and arrested Liu Ximing and detained him indefinitely.

In order to massacre prisoners of war, the detention authorities secretly gave instructions to their officers first. On Geoje Island, Bonner told his subordinates that the massacre of prisoners of war should be further intensified, and if they were killed, it should be said that the prisoners of war were about to riot. This was a secret that one of our comrades learned when he was on "official business" and picked up a memorandum from a U.S. lieutenant colonel. Many of our comrades died under this secret order. For example, on May 16, when we returned from "official business" on Geoje Island, the U.S. military suddenly wanted to inspect us. The U.S. military in charge of the 602nd camp took out his pistol and fired three shots in a row, killing prisoner of war Wang Huayi and injuring another prisoner of war.

The U.S. military authorities also deliberately provoked and created excuses for massacres. On September 19, when the No. 2 camp was on "official business," the U.S. military used the excuse that singing was "illegal" and stabbed more than 20 people.

The massacre on October 1, 1952, set a new record for the massacre of Chinese prisoners of war. In order to celebrate the National Day, we had previously notified the detention authorities that we would hang flags to celebrate. The detention authorities did not comment. On October 1, the detention authorities dispatched tanks and infantry to surround the prisoner-of-war camp and rushed into the No. 7 camp. Colonel Bai Lemo and Captain Brooks personally commanded the operation, and all kinds of firearms were fired at the same time, killing 56 people on the spot and injuring 109 people. Brooks personally shot and killed four people. Afterwards, they falsely claimed that we had rioted. But the facts are there, and they cannot deny it.

	IX. After an agreement was reached on the prisoner-of-war issue, the detention authorities still tried their best to prevent prisoners of war from returning to their country. The first thing they did was to use the excuse of handprints to individually call people into the office to entice and threaten them. After a comrade named Li from the No. 4 camp was called in, a U.S. military captain asked him where he was going. Li replied: "Of course I'm going back to my country." The captain tried to persuade him, saying: "It would be better to stay with the United Nations in the future. You can go to the United States and have a good life." Li replied: "What you said is only for deceiving ghosts." The captain was very angry and kicked him out. When a comrade named Zhang from the No. 10 camp went to get his handprint, a U.S. military officer from the CIE threatened him with death. Zhang said: "You're talking nonsense." So the U.S. military officer slapped him several times. The day after an agreement was reached on the prisoner-of-war issue, the U.S. military authorities continued to threaten and entice us in broadcasts, preventing us from returning to our country.

    中国人民志愿军被俘人员
    向世界人民控诉美方扣留、虐杀战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城二十四日电】中国人民志愿军被俘人员向全世界爱好和平正义的人民控诉美方强迫扣留战俘和虐杀战俘的暴行。他们已在八月十日下午三时将长达万言的控诉书一份，递交在汶山的联合红十字会小组的代表。
    控诉书说：让我们用亲身经历，进一步揭发美帝国主义那伪装的“民主”“人道”假面具后面的野蛮残暴的实质，“美国之音”和华尔街所有的宣传工具不管制造多少谎话，都掩饰不住美帝国主义的血腥的暴行。控诉书指出：事实上，这里所陈述的还只是美方暴行的很小的一部分。
    控诉书说：敌人的迫害和屠杀的种种残暴手段磨灭不了我们爱国、爱和平的斗争意志，这种血海深仇我们将永远不会忘记，它将激励我们在今后更坚决地为建设祖国与保卫和平而斗争。
    控诉书附备忘录一份，陈述了美军虐杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员的种种暴行：
    一、失去战斗力的受伤战俘成了美军的肉靶：一九五一年五月二十八日于东线北汉江以东一个防空洞里住着六百多名我军伤病人员，当美军开到后马上把这些伤病员赶出洞外，用机枪射击。少数不能行动而未曾出来的重伤病员，被美军投掷手榴弹炸毙。其中胡庭胜、黄明两人在机枪扫射时受伤未死而得幸免。
    二、榨取情报、暴力逼供，这是我们被俘以后所遭到的第一件事情，被俘的人没有一个能轻易逃过这一关的。审问机关是美军远东军事情报局，代号是G—2、美军远东军总部心理作战部及联邦调查局远东分局等。志愿军某部战士楚盛茂同志负伤被俘后马上被运到前方审问处。美军强迫楚承认是军官，并企图榨取情报，楚不肯透露，美军马上把楚的两个大拇指绑在电话机上，施以电刑，楚不支昏去，美军用冷水将他喷醒再问，如此连续施电刑四、五次之多，而楚始终不屈。
    三、伤病战俘是美军医术试验下的牺牲品，美军所设战俘医院就是变相的屠场：釜山战俘医院美军医生曾告诉个别伤病战俘说：“我们把最新创制的在美国还未使用的医药首先给你们吃。”一个有正义感的医生曾告诉战俘病员李姚说：“有什么法子，我们上级叫这样作。”他透露说，美国新出的医药在未被证实保险之前首先在战俘身上试验。此外，美军医务人员还故意把战俘治成残废。战俘高尚德，在医院看见有个叫吴守华的同志，仅背上负伤，但美军竟将其手臂割掉造成残废。有很多伤俘经美军医治后都变成严重的残废。
    四、生活虐待和饥饿：拘留当局发给我们的食粮每天都是杂皮带糠的小麦大麦，这些在我们祖国只有喂牲口才用的，有时发给长了绿毛的大米和擂得成块的面。而在份量上每天一人只有一磅左右，菜蔬是叶子发黄的白菜，老得咬不烂的萝卜。肉类更是难以见得到，在一九五二年上半年以前每人平均只给四百分之一磅的肉类，到下半年至现在根本没有尝到肉类。拘留当局仅将一些干得像硬树皮一样和钻满白蛆的鱼甩给我们。盐是经常缺乏的，煤和柴从来就没有发得够用过，饭常煮得半生，所以每个战俘一直是在饥饿中过日子。
    拘留当局又用不供给足够的饮水来折磨我们。在一九五一年，巨济岛上的中国战俘“七十二”联队有一万二千多人，只设有一个直径半寸口径的水管，水不够喝。我们渴，口里冒火，眼睛发花，不得已挖个小坑喝污水，但美军藉口说“我们挖坑逃亡”，开枪打死战俘一人。
    自从我们被俘后，美军用刺刀威迫着把衣服东西全部没收，然后发给一套破烂的美军衣服及一床粗硬的灰色毯子，这就是美军供给我们的全部衣物。冬天不论是风是雪仍然穿着这一套，而且还要强迫着在雪里大雨里做苦工。一九五一年七月间在巨济岛强迫中国战俘每人换一套红色的短裤衣（脱下来洗后只得湿着穿上或光着身子等它干），到十二月大雪纷飞的时候，仍是这一套短衣短裤，很多人冻死，更多的害着严重的关节痛。
    被俘人员夜里睡觉平均一人只能占到四寸至五寸宽的潮湿土地，根本没有见过床和地板，就是草席也难得看见。人压人，人挤人，伤病员整晚呻吟不止。一九五一年六月在釜山二百五十人住一个美军帐篷，大雨中流满了水，我们成夜蹲在泥水里，疥疮、风湿和战俘不分离。
    我们自被俘后，体重每人平均减轻了四十磅。因油类及维生素的缺乏而成了夜盲的占我们全体的百分之三十七，因冷冻及潮湿而患麻痹及关节痛的占百分之二十三。
    五、拘留当局经常打骂、侮辱和奴役战俘。他们以枪托、木棒、皮鞭、鞋尖把我们当牲口一样赶进赶出，强迫我们整天做苦工，稍不如意就是拳打脚踢，甚至在他们感到无聊时，也会对我们进行人身侮辱来取乐。
    在长时间的苦役中不准休息，假若身体不支，就是毒打。在一九五一年十一月间风雪交加的夜里，美军强迫巨济岛上的中国战俘到海上去做苦工，抬沙子、打石头，许多人因为身体不支而被毒打至死。我们两个战俘营最少有三分之二的人要到海边去替轮船下货，修路平地，被迫去给美军打扫驻地。在一九五二年三月二十三日我们到仓库去干苦工的时候，美军用刺刀逼着两个人去抬一个四百多磅左右的箱子，因为力气不够，只抬了半公尺高，便因无力而失手，其中一个腿被压伤，而美军反说他们抗命，第二天罚他们打一天石头的苦工，还不给饭吃。
    六、美军为扣留战俘，使用为国际公法所严禁的毒气弹并公然宣布这是合法的。在一九五二年六月间当美军使用毒气弹后，美方战俘营长官波纳准将竟说：“为了镇压战俘，使用毒气弹是合法的。”表面上是使用催泪性毒气弹，实际上，各种毒气弹都用遍了。在一九五二年六月二十九日，在巨济岛上，上尉布鲁克斯亲自带领美军包围战俘营，要我们五分钟内马上移动，但当我们走的时候又说我们走得慢了，便下令投掷毒气弹，投了有四五百枚，全营浓烟弥漫，毒气散布达三小时之久。在一九五二年七月中旬，有一天，美军武装步兵排进入第七号营场进行检查，美军走后又藉口战俘唱歌，突然闯入营内，大量施放催泪性毒气弹，并且喷射糜烂性的粉剂，结果重伤二十余人，轻伤十余人，有五六个人因受毒而眼睛失明。在一九五二年八月十五日我们按惯例举行庆祝日本法西斯投降纪念会。美军当局说：“日本是我们的朋友，不许纪念这节日，纪念就是非法。”对十个营场出动大批部队，施放催泪性毒气弹五六千枚及大量的糜烂性粉剂。临回国的战俘离开战俘营前，又连续受到毒气弹的袭击。
    七、利用特务控制，进行屠杀，以达到扣留战俘的目的。美军当局把在东京美国远东情报局受过训的特务王顺清、王福田、刘并章、李奇、应详云、王家悌、方石、熊光等派至战俘营担任联队长、警备队长、所谓战俘“代表”及C IE学校负责人，组织“警备队”，强迫刺字签名。美军当局交给那些特务们棍棒、皮鞭和刻有US字样的利刀，对热爱祖国的战俘进行暴力控制，多少人被灌过冷水、受电刑、毒打、吊绑、割肉、甚至挖心，人间所有酷刑无一不备，每天每夜鞭打声与呻吟声到处可闻。美军当局还勾结台湾蒋匪，由台湾派遣一百零四名特务，其中包括国民党军统局的特务，在一九五一年间在战俘营内开设所谓“C IE学校”强迫进行“政治教育”，禁止信仰自由，不准唱祖国的歌曲，并且在营内安装扩音器，每日广播欺骗宣传，对共产党和中华人民共和国以及一切爱好和平的民主国家进行诽谤和诬蔑，并且恐吓、威胁战俘，企图达到扣留战俘的目的。而披着宗教外衣的特务则以天主、耶稣、“如来”之名诱骗战俘。美军当局看到这一套毒化政策在战俘面前宣告失败之后，马上又命令他的走狗以暴力来代替诱骗，在一九五二年四月八日进行“甄别”，大肆屠杀，造成“四八”大血案。
    特务们强迫战俘在身上刺字。韩之、张成瑞、姜云等因坚持不刺字不签名而遭受六十九次拷打，很多人是被绑起来刺上的。在“甄别”前夜，特务们拿着棒子、刀子，逼着不刺字的出外站队，由几个人按着硬给刺上。
    为了强迫战俘不回国，美军当局指使特务使用非人的酷刑，孔繁荣同志在四八“甄别”时坚持回国，特务们用灭火器的橡皮管装满辣椒水由肛门里灌进去，再打压肚子，把水挤出来，孔因而昏死去了几次。
    在四八“甄别”前夜，八十六、七十二联队死在棍棒利刀下的不知有多少人，杨文华首先被打死，特务用刀挖出杨文华的心提在手上到处恫吓说：“你们看，这就是要回国的。”当时美军看到都大笑着，伸出大拇指叫好。
    八、任意扣押和屠杀战俘。在一九五二年六月三十日，无故将战俘王芳扣入狱中毒打拷问，在七月间将美军用车接往七十六号营场去开会的中国战俘代表孙振冠、张泽石无故扣押判罪。在十月二十日晚美军突然进入五号营场逮捕刘锡明，并无限期扣押。
    拘留当局为了屠杀战俘，秘密地先给他们军官下了指示。在巨济岛，波纳告诉他的下属说，对战俘要进一步加紧屠杀、杀了就说战俘要暴动。这是我们一个同志在“出公差”时拾到一个美军中校的一张备忘录而得知的秘密。我们有很多同志在这道秘密命令下丧生。如在五月十六日在巨济岛“出公差”回来时，美军突然要检查我们。管理六零二营场的美军掏出手枪连发三响，打死战俘王化义，打伤另一战俘。
    美军当局并故意挑衅，制造屠杀藉口。在九月十九日二号营场“出公差”时，美军藉口唱歌“违法”，刺伤二十多人。
    一九五二年十月一日的大屠杀，创造了屠杀中国战俘的新纪录。为了庆祝国庆，我们事先曾通知拘留当局要悬旗庆祝。拘留当局未置可否。在十月一日那天，拘留当局却出动坦克和步兵，将战俘营团团包围，并冲进七号营场，由上校白乐摩、上尉布鲁克斯亲自指挥，各种火器一齐开动，当场杀死五十六人，打伤一百零九人，布鲁克斯亲自开枪打死四人，事后他们诡称我们暴动。但是事实俱在，他们是无从抵赖的。
    九、战俘问题取得协议后，拘留当局仍竭力阻止战俘回国，首先就是藉口对手印，个别叫进办公室去诱骗及恐吓威胁。四号营场一个姓李的同志被叫去后，一个美军上尉问他要到那里去，李答：“我当然回国。”这个上尉劝诱说：“将来留在联合国方面多好，可以到美国去过好日子。”李回答道：
    “你说的只有骗鬼。”那个上尉很生气，一脚把他踢出去。十号营场一个姓张的同志去对手印时，CIE一个美国军官拿死来恫吓他。张说：“你胡说”。于是那美国军官打了他几个耳光。战俘问题取得协议的第二天，美军当局就在广播中继续威胁和诱骗我们，不让我们回国。
