Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th - Today, among the repatriated prisoners of war on our side, there were 474 female prisoners of war.

    As the long line of ambulances carrying these female prisoners of war drove into our handover zone, a mixture of crying, singing, and slogans could be heard from inside the vehicles. Holding self-made national flags, they leaned out of the car windows, some rushing from the front door of the ambulance to the driver's platform, all waving to the people representing the motherland who had come to receive them. Each of them was sobbing uncontrollably, but still shouting "Long live!" and singing revolutionary songs in hoarse voices. After getting out of the cars, our reception personnel went forward to shake hands with them. They threw themselves into the arms of our personnel and cried to their hearts' content, like daughters who had suffered all kinds of humiliation and bullying outside returning to their mother's embrace.

    They were all neatly dressed in self-made army uniforms in the style of their own army, and almost everyone held a flag of both Korea and China sewn from their own colored clothes. Kim Young-ja, a female prisoner of war from the Korean People's Army, held a huge banner with large red characters that read: "Long Live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!" This was written in her own blood, having bitten her finger on the train heading north from Busan.

    Among the returning female prisoners of war, there was a female volunteer soldier, Yang Yuhua, wearing a self-made volunteer army hat and holding a self-made five-star national flag. In the prisoner of war camp, she united with the female prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army and waged a resolute struggle to demand repatriation.

    Accompanying the return of our female prisoners of war were 23 children. The older children, along with their mothers, held national flags and sang revolutionary songs. One of the children even held a self-made flag of the Korean Democratic People's Republic Young Pioneers.

    Among these female prisoners of war on our side, there were 12 mentally ill patients. Some of them were so mentally deranged that they could not understand that they had returned to their own country. When our reception personnel shook hands with a mentally ill patient and disinfected her, she exclaimed "Scared!". Another mentally ill patient tightly held a pair of scissors and refused to let go.

    Among the other prisoners of war repatriated today, some were repatriated by the US side as healthy individuals, but they were all seriously ill. Some could not walk and had to be carried down from the cars. Wang Fucheng, a prisoner of war from the Volunteer Army, had been suffering from gastrointestinal disease for more than half a month, and the US side had never given him treatment. Before this repatriation, he had only eaten a half-cooked rice ball made of barley and rice in two days and three nights. He had fainted several times on the way to repatriation.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th - Among the 474 female prisoners of war on our side who were repatriated on the 9th, there was a female prisoner of war from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army named Yang Yuhua.

    When reporters discovered Yang Yuhua on the repatriation vehicle, she was waving a self-made flag of the People's Republic of China, wearing a self-made hat of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and wearing a pair of shoes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army that she had risked her life to preserve in the US prisoner of war camp. This girl, who had suffered hardship and torture in the US prisoner of war camp for two years, burst into tears as soon as she got off the car and hugged the comrades who greeted her. Comrades surrounded her to comfort her, wiped the sweat from her forehead, and carefully helped her onto our repatriation vehicle. As the car drove into the sanitary passage area, the Korean old ladies and women who were waiting in the square to welcome them were moved to tears. As soon as the car stopped, many people came up to comfort Yang Yuhua. Du Ping, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who came to express his condolences to our returning personnel, cordially took her hand and comforted her, saying: You have finally returned to the embrace of the motherland. The motherland cares for you like a mother. I hope you will rest well and take care of your health.

    There were large scars on Yang Yuhua's arm. This was caused by the US military throwing gas bombs after she boarded the train in Busan at 2:00 PM on August 8th. When the US military pushed her and other female prisoners of war on our side into the carriages and closed the doors and windows tightly, they immediately realized that a new disaster was about to befall them. At that time, Yang Yuhua was in the last carriage. Before long, the US military personnel actually threw gas bombs in from one end of the carriage. Yang Yuhua rushed forward and used her body to protect the female prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army and their children. Three gas bombs exploded one after another at her feet, burning her.

    In the past two years, Yang Yuhua has established an unbreakable friendship with her Korean sisters in this struggle of sharing life and death and sharing weal and woe. She also received deep care and love from the female prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army in the US prisoner of war camp. Once, she was dragged out of the prisoner of war camp by the US personnel, and the female prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army went on a hunger strike to protest, forcing the US personnel to release her.

    After Yang Yuhua returned and was transferred to the hospital, the female prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army also asked someone to bring her a watch as a souvenir.

### 我方女被俘人员一批回到祖国怀抱

    我方女被俘人员一批回到祖国怀抱
    【新华社开城九日电】今天遣返归来的我方被俘人员中，有四百七十四名女被俘人员。
    当载运这些女被俘人员的一长列救护车驶进我方交接区时，就听得车内的哭泣声、歌声、口号声混成一片。她们拿着自制的国旗从车窗里探出头来，有的从救护车的前门冲到司机台上，一齐向代表祖国来接待她们的人招手，她们每个人都已泣不成声，但还是用嘶哑了的嗓子欢呼万岁和高唱革命歌曲。她们走下车后，我方接待人员上前去和她们握手，她们扑进我方人员的怀里尽情地痛哭起来，像在外面受尽了凌辱和欺侮的女儿回到了母亲的怀抱里时那样。
    她们都整齐地穿着她们自制的自己军队式样的上身军装，她们几乎每个人都拿着一面用她们自己的彩色衣服缝制的朝、中两国的国旗。朝鲜人民军女被俘人员金英子拿着一条巨幅标语，上面大大的红字写着：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！”这是她在从釜山北上的火车上咬破自己的手指用鲜血写成的。
    在归来的女被俘人员中，有一位志愿军女被俘人员杨玉华，她戴着自己缝制的志愿军军帽，拿着一面自制的五星国旗。在战俘营里，她和朝鲜人民军的女被俘人员团结在一起，进行了坚决要求遣返的斗争。
    随着我方女被俘人员归来的还有二十三个儿童，大一些的孩子也和他们的母亲一起拿着国旗，唱着革命歌曲。其中有一个儿童还拿着一面自制的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国少年团团旗。
    在这些我方女被俘人员中有十二名精神病患者。她们有的神经十分错乱，不能明白她们已经回到了自己的祖国。当我方接待人员和一个精神病患者握手并给她消毒时，她惊呼“害怕”。另一个精神病患者紧握着一把剪刀，一直不肯松手。
    今天遣返的其他被俘人员中，有一些是为美方当作健康者遣返的，但他们都身带重病，有的不能走动，要人从汽车上背下来。志愿军被俘人员王福成已经患肠胃病半个多月，美方从来没有给他治疗。这次遣返以前，他在两天三夜中只吃过一顿半生不熟的大麦和大米做成的饭团。在遣返的路上他曾昏倒过好几次。
    【新华社开城十日电】九日遣返归来的四百七十四名我方女被俘人员中，有一个中国人民志愿军的女被俘人员，她的名字叫杨玉华。
    当记者从遣返车辆上发现杨玉华的时候，她正挥舞着一面自己缝制的中华人民共和国的国旗，戴着自己缝制的中国人民志愿军军帽，脚上还穿着一双在美方战俘营内冒着生命危险保存下来的中国人民志愿军军鞋。这个两年来在美方战俘营内受尽了苦难和折磨的姑娘，一下车就抱着迎接她的同志痛哭起来。同志们围着安慰她，给她擦去额上的汗珠，小心地把她扶上了我方的遣接汽车。当汽车驶入卫生通过区时，等候在广场上欢迎她们的朝鲜老大娘和妇女，都激动得流下了眼泪。汽车刚刚停下，许多人都迎上来慰问杨玉华。前来慰问我方归来人员的中国人民志愿军政治部副主任杜平将军亲切地拉住她的手，安慰她说：你终于回到祖国怀抱里来了，祖国像母亲一样地关怀着你，希望你好好休息，保重身体。
    在杨玉华的手臂上有着大块的伤痕。这是八月八日下午二时她在釜山上了火车以后，被美军部队投掷的毒气弹烧伤的。当美军部队把她及其他我方女被俘人员推进车厢、紧闭门窗的时候，她们立刻意识到新的灾难就要临头了。当时，杨玉华在最后一节车厢里。不一会，美军人员果然从车厢的一端投掷进毒气弹来。杨玉华就奋身冲上前去，用身体掩护朝鲜人民军的女被俘人员和她们的孩子。三颗毒气弹接连落在她的脚边爆炸，把她烧伤了。
    两年来，杨玉华在这种同生死、共患难的斗争中，和朝鲜姊妹建立了牢不可破的友谊。她在美方战俘营中，也受到了朝鲜人民军女被俘人员的深切关怀和爱护。有一次，她被美方人员从战俘营拉了出去，朝鲜人民军女被俘人员就全体绝食抗议，迫使美方人员把她放了回来。
    在杨玉华归来被转送到医院以后，朝鲜人民军女被俘人员还托人带给她一只表作为纪念品。
