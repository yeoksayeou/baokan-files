    Northeast Region Vigorously Promotes Advanced Construction Experience
    Shenyang, Changchun, and Other Places Hold Advanced Experience Demonstration Meetings
    Various places in the Northeast have begun to seize the opportunity to promote advanced experiences in basic construction. Recently, Changchun, Heilongjiang, Fushun, Songjiang, Shenyang, Dalian and other places, with the region or engineering company as the unit, have successively held large-scale basic construction advanced experience demonstration conferences or exhibitions.
    Basic construction workers in various places demonstrated many decisive advanced experiences at the conference. The Shenyang Construction Company of the Central First Ministry of Machinery Industry demonstrated eight advanced experiences in plastering, carpentry, bricklaying, tile hanging, and rebar work at the advanced experience demonstration meeting. The efficiency of each advanced experience exceeded the quota by at least 80 percent, while ensuring quality. The most brilliant performance was the plastering advanced method of the Xia Baoshan group. They renovated twenty-three kinds of new tools, rationally allocated and improved labor organization, implemented the flow operation method, enriched Yang Dezhong's plastering advanced experience, exceeding the quota by 315 percent for plastering wall sand, 220 percent for plastering eaves, and 320 percent for plastering whitewash, making it smooth and flat. Another brilliant performance was Zhao Wanhai's advanced method of hanging tiles. Their group of six people hung 1,800 tiles in 61 minutes. At the demonstration meeting held by the Songjiang Provincial People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau, sixteen advanced groups of eight types of work participated in the demonstration. Among them, the bricklaying efficiency of the Li Youcai bricklaying group of the Songjiang Provincial First Engineering Company, using the level bricklaying method, averaged 3,000 bricks per person per day, an efficiency increase of two times compared to the old method, exceeding the quota by one time. The An Deben carpentry group demonstrated the large-scale joint flow operation method, making 80 window frames a day, an average of five and a half frames per person. The Wang Huabin bricklaying group of the Mudanjiang City Engineering Company demonstrated the new tool double-handed slurry squeezing method, and the bricklaying efficiency was preliminarily marked at an average of 5,000 bricks per person per day. At the Heilongjiang Provincial Demonstration Conference, the Xie Baoshu carpentry group demonstrated the Xie Wanfu flow operation method. They used four tools they researched and created, including a scribing table, a dovetail saw, a triangular plane, and an installation table for operation, making 154 window sashes a day, and the quality fully met the standards. The Chen Desheng group of the First Engineering Office of the Benxi Industrial Engineering Company demonstrated Yu Donghai's grouting flow operation method. They used their own researched double-strand grouting tool for operation, grouting 2.2 square meters in four minutes. Calculated on a nine-hour basis, one person can grout 72 square meters a day. The Liu Xiangchen rebar work group of the Qiqihar Railway Construction Engineering Team created many new tools for bending rebar last year, greatly improving work efficiency. In this year's construction, they further researched and developed platform-style hook benders and curve benders and other tools. In the past, two people would bend two hooks of quarter-inch rebar at a time. This time, using the new tools they researched, two people bent six at a time. They also created a two-handed operation method for bending ring beam rebar, which increased efficiency by one time compared to the past. Shao Enbo, the carpentry captain of the Benxi Industrial Engineering Company, created a concrete column model board last year. This year, he accepted the advanced experience of the Soviet overhead support formwork and created a truss support method. While concrete engineering is being carried out, other types of work can also be carried out, shortening the construction cycle and saving a lot of wood.
    The demonstration conference is a major review of advanced experiences in various places, and also a general mobilization to promote advanced experiences. The performances of advanced groups in various places have encouraged the employee representatives attending the meeting and strengthened their confidence in promoting advanced experiences. This vivid and powerful education has made them further realize the superiority of advanced experiences; they also realized that the process of promoting advanced experiences is the process of struggle between conservative thinking and advanced thinking. Many people at the meeting reviewed their conservative thinking of not believing in advanced experiences, and expressed that they would take the lead in promoting advanced experiences and set off a mass upsurge of learning advanced experiences.

    东北区大力推广先进施工经验
    沈阳长春等地召开先进经验表演会
    东北各地已开始抓紧推广基本建设先进经验。最近长春、黑龙江、抚顺、松江、沈阳、旅大等地，都以地区或工程公司为单位，先后召开了规模较大的基本建设先进经验表演大会或展览会。
    各地基本建设工人在大会上表演了很多有决定性的先进经验。中央第一机械工业部沈阳建筑公司先进经验表演会上表演了抹灰、木工、瓦工、挂瓦、铁筋工等工种八项先进经验，每种先进经验的效率最低都超过定额百分之八十以上，而且保证了质量。其中最精采的表演是夏宝山小组的抹灰先进方法。他们改造了二十三种新工具，合理配备和改进劳动组织，实行流水作业法，丰富了杨德重抹灰先进经验，抹墙砂子灰超过定额百分之三百十五，抹檐口超过百分之二百二十，抹白灰超过百分之三百二十，抹得又光又平。另一项精采的表演是赵万海的挂瓦先进方法，他们小组六个人，在六十一分钟内挂了一千八百块瓦。在松江省人民政府建筑工程局召开的表演会上，有八个工种的十六个先进小组参加表演，其中松江省第一工程公司李有才瓦工小组的水平器砌砖法，砌砖效率平均达到每人每天三千块，比旧法提高效率二倍，超过定额一倍。安德本木工小组表演大联合流水作业法，一天做了八十扇窗户，每人平均做五扇半。牡丹江市工程公司王化斌瓦工小组表演的多种新工具双手挤浆法，砌砖效率据初步标定，每人每天平均达到五千块。在黑龙江省的表演大会上，谢宝树木工小组表演了谢万福流水作业法。他们用自己研究创造的划线台、拉肩倒铆锯、三角刨子、安装台等四种工具进行操作，每天做一百五十四个窗扇，质量完全合乎标准。本溪工业工程公司第一工程处陈德胜小组表演了于东海抅缝流水作业法。他们用自己研究的双股抅缝挠子操作，四分钟抅缝二点二平方公尺。按九小时计算，一个人一天可抅缝七十二平方公尺。齐齐哈尔铁路建筑工程队刘相臣铁筋工小组，去年曾创造了许多种弯铁筋的新工具，大大提高了工作效率。在今年施工中又进一步研究出平台式的弯钩器和曲弯器等工具。过去弯四分铁筋的钩两个人一次弯两个，这次表演时用他们研究的新工具，两个人一次就弯六个。他们并创造了弯圈梁铁筋的双手作业法，较过去提高效率一倍。本溪工业工程公司木工队长邵恩波，去年曾创造了混凝土柱模型板，今年他接受了苏联架空支模板的先进经验，又创造了桁架支模法，在作混凝土工程的同时，其他工种也可以进行操作，缩短了工程的周期，并节省了大量木材。
    表演大会是对各地先进经验的大检阅，同时也是推广先进经验的总动员。各地先进小组的表演，鼓舞了参加会议的职工代表们，加强了他们推广先进经验的信心，这一次生动有力的教育使他们进一步认识了先进经验的优越性；也认识到推广先进经验的过程，就是保守思想和先进思想斗争的过程。许多人在会上检讨了不相信先进经验的保守思想，表示回去后要带头推广先进经验，掀起一个群众性的学习先进经验的高潮。
