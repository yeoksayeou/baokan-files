    Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 21st: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its meeting on the morning of the 20th. Czechoslovakian representative Ms. Sekaninova spoke first. She said: The end of the bloodshed in Korea is a great victory for the people who strive for peace, and a failure for those who advocate a policy of force. Moreover, the realization of the Korean armistice powerfully proves that all current problems can be resolved peacefully through negotiation. She reminded the committee that some forces have been doing everything possible in the past and present to prevent the easing of international tensions, and the United Nations General Assembly should do its best to ensure that the issue of the political conference is resolved correctly.

    Ms. Sekaninova agreed with the opinions of the British and French representatives that a "round table conference" is better than a meeting of "opposing sides," and pointed out that the concept of opposing sides negotiating does not make the work of the conference easier at all.

    Ms. Sekaninova finally said that the Czechoslovakian delegation will vote in favor of the Soviet delegation's proposal and called on other representatives to support the proposal as well.

    Turkish representative Mr. Sarper then spoke. He was a co-signer of the proposal on the Korean issue put forward by the United States and some other countries. He said that he could not support the Soviet proposal. At the same time, he also agreed with the suggestion of inviting the Soviet Union and India to participate in the political conference.

    British representative Mr. Lloyd spoke last at the meeting. He said that he could only partially support the Soviet proposal. He said that the British delegation would vote in favor of the suggestion of inviting the Soviet Union and India to participate in the political conference. Mr. Lloyd believed that whether it is appropriate to allow Poland to participate in the political conference is quite questionable, because according to this suggestion, Switzerland, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia, which are members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission together with Poland, have not been nominated to participate in the political conference. He said that the Soviet proposal did not mention certain countries that had participated in the Korean War, and he could not agree with this proposal. Mr. Lloyd said that he was still unclear about the last paragraph of the Soviet proposal, which stipulates that at the political conference, resolutions would be adopted if they were agreed upon by both sides that signed the armistice agreement.

    联大政治委员会二十日上午继续举行会议
    捷代表拥护苏联关于政治会议问题的提案
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：联合国大会政治委员会在二十日上午继续举行会议。捷克斯洛伐克代表塞卡尼诺娃首先发言。她说：朝鲜流血事件的终止，是争取和平的人民的伟大胜利，是主张武力政策的人的失败。而且，朝鲜停战的实现还有力地证明，当前的一切问题都是能够以协商方式和平解决的。她提醒委员会说，有一些势力在过去及现在一直尽一切办法阻止国际紧张局势的缓和，联合国大会应该尽力使政治会议的问题得到正确的解决。
    塞卡尼诺娃同意英国和法国代表的意见，认为“圆桌会议”比“对立双方”的会议好，并且指出，对立双方谈判的概念一点也不能使会议的工作易于进行。
    塞卡尼诺娃最后说，捷克斯洛伐克代表团将投票赞成苏联代表团的提案，并要求其他代表也支持这个提案。
    土耳其代表萨佩尔接着发言。他是以美国为首的一些国家提出的关于朝鲜问题提案的附署人，他说，他不能支持苏联的提案。同时，他又赞成邀请苏联和印度参加政治会议的建议。
    英国代表劳埃德在会议上最后一个发言。他说，他只能部分地支持苏联的提案。他说，英国代表团将投票赞成邀请苏联和印度参加政治会议的建议。劳埃德认为，让波兰参加政治会议是否适宜，颇成问题，因为按照这个建议，与波兰同为中立国遣返委员会成员的瑞士、瑞典和捷克斯洛伐克，都没有被提名参加政治会议。他说，苏联的提案没有提到某些曾经参加朝鲜战争的国家，他不能表示同意这个提案。劳埃德说，苏联提案的最后一段规定，在政治会议上，决议如果得到签订停战协定双方的同意即作为通过，关于这一点，他还弄不清楚。
