    [This News Report] Industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast, East China, and Southwest regions mostly completed their production plans for the first half of this year.

    Northeast Region

    The state-owned industries in the Northeast region basically completed their production tasks for the first half of this year. The total output value of enterprises under the five industrial ministries of the central government reached 101.6% of the planned target for the first half of the year, and 37 of the 56 major products completed their plans. Achievements have been made in leveraging the potential of enterprises, rationally utilizing resources, improving technical levels, and improving product quality. The ferrous metal sector continued to promote the full-blast, fast-feed, and smooth-operation method for blast furnaces, and improved the supply of sintered ore, enabling the completion of the production plan for the first half of the year 21 days ahead of schedule. The machinery industry sector promoted the Kolesov tool method, greatly improving production efficiency. The coal mining industry reformed coal mining methods, changing the inclined longwall water-sand filling method to the longwall method, creating conditions for future mechanized coal mining. Continuous technological progress is reflected in the increase of new products and the improvement of product quality. In the first half of the year, the machinery factories successfully trial-produced more than 120 new products. In addition, the proportion of high-quality steel in the total steel ingot output increased from 16.8% in the first half of last year to 32.7% in the first half of this year.

    There are still some relatively serious problems in the production of state-owned industries in the Northeast region: 1. Although the technical level of most industries in the region has improved compared with last year, the technical and economic quota plans have not been completed well. Only three of the thirteen major quotas of seven industries have been completed, with the mining industry being the worst. 2. Due to chaotic production management, weak technical management, and poor equipment, coupled with the lack of attention to product quality by enterprise leaders, many products have high defect rates, low pass rates, poor quality and performance, unstable quality, and poor quality of new products. 3. Production accidents are serious. For example, various accidents in the coal mining sector are more serious than in the same period last year. Accidents at Anshan Iron and Steel Company are also increasing month by month. Although the number of accidents in the electricity, petroleum, chemical, and non-ferrous metal bureaus has decreased compared with the same period last year, the nature of the accidents is very serious. 4. Labor discipline is lax. The attendance rate of the non-ferrous metal industry, coal mining industry, textile industry, and machinery industry has not reached the plan, and the attendance rate is even lower than in the same period last year. The attendance rate in other departments is also not good enough. In addition, some heavy industrial products such as steel, coal, and machine tools have not completed their plans. Cost overruns are also very common.

    The main reasons for these serious problems are the increased production tasks this year, but weak leadership, chaotic production management, and low technical level. The state-owned industries in the Northeast region have not completed the tasks for the first half of the year well, and the tasks for the second half of the year will be even more arduous. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership structure, improve leadership methods, strengthen planning management, launch competitions, strive for improvement, and ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion of production tasks.

    East China Region

    Of the 23 major products produced by state-owned and joint state-private industries in East China in the first half of the year, 16 products completed the state plan. Judging from the implementation of the plan in the first half of the year, the second quarter showed progress compared to the first quarter. For example, in terms of actual output, the output of 18 of the 23 products increased. In terms of quality, the second quarter was also better than the first quarter. For example, the qualified rate of open-hearth steel ingots in Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Factory was 95.3% in the first quarter and 97.86% in the second quarter.

    The improvement in the implementation of the plan in the second quarter compared with the first quarter was mainly due to the fact that various factories checked and summarized the implementation of the plan in the first quarter, and extensively mobilized employees to discuss the plan for the second quarter and the monthly plans. Some factories and mines also promoted job plans in workshops, sections, and even groups. At the same time, labor discipline was generally strengthened due to the strengthening of political education and the improvement of safety and health facilities. For example, after summarizing the completion of the production plan in the first quarter, Jinan No. 4 Machine Tool Factory mobilized employees to conduct summary appraisals, and put forward the slogan of "three appraisals (appraisal of plan, appraisal of quality, appraisal of safety), and two finding (finding reasons, finding experience)". Through the efforts of all employees of the factory, the production of metal cutting machine tools in April, May, and June all exceeded the plan.

    There are still some problems in the production in the first half of the year, the most important of which is the inability to comprehensively and evenly complete the plan, which is specifically manifested as follows:

    1. Although the total output of some products has completed the plan, a small number of factories producing these products have not completed the plan. For example, the total power output in the second quarter exceeded the plan by 2.9%, but the Nanjing Power Supply Bureau only completed 96.9%. The total output of cotton yarn in the second quarter exceeded the plan by 1.62%, but the state-owned Shanghai No. 18 Cotton Textile Factory only completed 97.93%.

    2. The phenomenon of being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end has not yet been overcome. When Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory checked the June plan on June 28, it found that the generator had not completed the plan, the motor was short of 3,600 kilowatts, and the transformer was short of 35,000 kilovolt-amperes. Although an emergency meeting was held and rushed overnight, the product plan for June was still not completed.

    3. The production of work-in-process and semi-finished products has not been completed or has not been completed in a very balanced manner. The general machinery factory completed the planned value of commodity output in April, but the work-in-process and semi-finished products were not completed according to the plan, which affected the failure of the commodity output value in May to complete the plan. And in June, the factory's work-in-process and semi-finished products were still not completed according to the plan.

    The second problem in the production in the first half of the year is that the quality of some products is very poor. Although the quality of products in the steel and textile industries in the second quarter has improved compared with the first quarter, there are still a few factories that have not made any improvements. For example, the end breakage rate and secondary cloth rate of the state-owned Shanghai No. 11 Cotton Textile Factory are still very high. In terms of machinery factories, the quality of finished products, especially the quality of castings, cannot be well controlled. For example, the scrap rate of cylinder liners in Wuxi Machine Tool Factory has been as high as 64%.

    The third problem is that the technical design is not cautious enough, and the parts management is relatively chaotic. This is mainly reflected in the errors in drawings and the disconnection of parts supply.

    The fourth problem in the production in the first half of the year is the problem of labor discipline. In the second quarter, the labor discipline of most factories has been strengthened to a certain extent, but there are still quite serious problems in some factories.

    The fifth problem in the production in the first half of the year is that equipment maintenance has not received due attention, and technical regulations and operating procedures have not been universally and strictly observed, resulting in many accidents, especially in the steel industry, where equipment accidents are a fairly common and serious problem, which was more prominent in June. Asia Steel Factory burned down an electric furnace transformer, resulting in a one-third reduction in steel ingot output.

    Based on the above situation, state-owned enterprises and joint state-private enterprises in East China should seriously strengthen planning management, improve enterprise management level, and strengthen political work in the future.

    Southwest Region

    Among the 52 major state-owned and joint state-private factories and mines in the Southwest region, 32 factories and mines, including Factory 102, Factory 104, Factory 505, and Yunnan Tin Company, exceeded the production plan for the first half of the year. Another 18 factories and mines, including Sichuan Cement Factory, Coal Mine 405, and Huize Lead-Zinc Factory, did not complete the major product plan for the first half of the year. Among the 26 major products produced by the above factories and mines, 18 major products exceeded the output plan for the first half of the year. In terms of product quality, some products have been significantly improved. The qualified rate of steel ingot quality according to the prescribed standard should be 96%, and Factory 101 has reached 98.46%. The quality of electrolytic copper also exceeds the prescribed standard, and the copper content of electrolytic copper in Factory 103 has reached 99.98%. However, the quality of most industrial products in the Southwest region has not yet reached the standard, and the quality of some products is still very poor. For example, except for the quality of yarn produced by Yarn Factory 611 in the textile system, which has reached grade A yarn, most of the yarn spun by other factories is below grade B, and the quality of yarn produced by Factory 610 in May even dropped to grade D.

    The main reasons why major factories and mines in the Southwest region were able to largely exceed the production plan for the first half of the year are: First, production reforms were carried out, and starting from the second quarter, the masses were generally mobilized to discuss the plan, so that leaders and workers established the concept of completing the state plan, and leveraged the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. At the same time, on the basis of discussing the plan, planning management was gradually established, and the enterprise management level was improved. Therefore, in January and February, more than 70% of the factories and mines in the Southwest region did not complete the plan, but by May and June, more than 70% of the factories and mines had completed the plan. Second, most factory and mine leaders were able to go deep into the workshops, listen to workers' opinions, and solve problems specifically, changing the past tendency of leaders only being busy with political movements and neglecting to study production. Due to the leaders going deep into the workshops and facing production, the phenomenon of inconsistent steps among the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League in the past has begun to change, and they have united on the goal of facing production together. Third, various factories and mines have successively grasped and solved the key problems of production in their own factories to varying degrees, so that the output and quality in the first half of the year have been improved, and there has been a specific guarantee for completing the state plan.

    At present, there are still many shortcomings in the management work of various factories and mines, and they have not yet gotten rid of the chaotic state. This is manifested in: 1. The planning management system is unsound. Many factories and mines have not seriously established job plans. Except for Factory 101 and Factory 606, the plans made by various factories and mines are mostly in name only. To date, many factories and mines have not done original records and quota work, the records of main indicators are incorrect, and some quota figures are still from last year, which cannot reflect the actual production situation. 2. Production is sometimes loose and sometimes tight, the processes are disconnected before and after, and the phenomenon of imbalance is very serious. Some factories and mines are either shut down waiting for materials, or busy repairing in the first ten days of the month and working overtime to catch up with tasks in the last ten days of the month, and production is extremely unbalanced. 3. In production, the phenomenon of unclear division of labor and no one being responsible for each functional department is serious. In addition, some factories and mines do not have a sound equipment, maintenance system, and maintenance system, as well as a replacement system for parts and tools, resulting in continuous accidents. In the first half of the year, 6 coal mines, including 401 and 405, had 1,297 accidents of varying sizes, which seriously affected output and quality. In the future, various factories and mines in the Southwest region must strengthen planning management, improve and establish a responsibility system and job plan, so that production can proceed in a balanced manner.

    东北区、华东区和西南区的工矿企业
    上半年生产计划大部完成
    应继续加强计划管理进一步作到均衡生产
    【本报讯】东北区国营工业和华东区、西南区国营及公私合营工业今年上半年生产计划大部完成。
    东北区
    东北区国营工业基本上完成了今年上半年的生产任务。中央五个工业部所属企业的总产值达到上半年计划百分之一百零一点六，五十六种主要产品有三十七种完成了计划。在发挥企业潜在力量、合理利用资源、提高技术水平、改进产品质量等方面都作出了一些成绩。黑色金属部门继续推行了高炉的全风、快料、顺行法，改善了烧结的供应，使上半年生产计划提前二十一天完成；机械工业部门推广科列索夫车刀法，大大提高了生产效率；煤矿工业改革了采煤方法，把倾斜长壁式的水砂充填法改为长壁式，为今后机械化采煤创造了条件。技术的不断进步表现在新产品的增加和产品质量的改进上，上半年各机械厂试制成功的新产品共有一百二十多种。此外，优质钢产量占总钢锭的比重，去年上半年为百分之十六点八，今年上半年已增加到百分之三十二点七。
    东北区国营工业在生产中还有一些比较严重的问题：一、全区大部分工业的技术水平比去年虽然提高了，但技术经济定额计划完成得不够好，七种工业的十三项主要定额，完成计划的只有三项，其中以矿山最差。二、由于生产管理混乱、技术管理薄弱和设备不良，加上企业领导干部不重视产品质量，不少产品废品多、合格率低、品质和性能不良、质量不稳定，新产品质量也低劣。三、生产事故严重。如煤矿部门各种事故都比去年同时期严重。鞍山钢铁公司的事故也在逐月增加，电业、石油、化工、有色金属等局事故次数虽比去年同时期减少了，但事故的性质却很严重。四、劳动纪律松弛。有色金属工业、煤矿工业、纺织工业、机械工业的出勤率都没有达到计划，出勤率比去年同一时期还低，其他部门也不够好。此外，钢材、煤、工作母机等部分重工业产品也没有完成计划。成本超支的现象也很普遍。
    产生这些严重问题的主要原因是今年的生产任务加大，但领导力量薄弱，生产管理混乱，技术水平低。东北区国营工业上半年的任务完成得不够好，下半年任务就会更加艰巨，因此必须加强领导机构，改进领导方法，加强计划管理，展开竞赛，争取好转，保证全面地均衡地完成生产任务。
    华东区
    华东区国营和公私合营工业上半年所生产的二十三种主要产品，有十六种产品完成了国家计划。从上半年执行计划的情况来看，第二季度比第一季度有了进步。例如在实际产量方面，在二十三种产品中，产量增加的有十八种。质量方面，第二季度也比第一季度好。如上海钢铁公司一厂的平炉钢锭第一季度合格率为百分之九十五点三，第二季为百分之九十七点八六。
    第二季度计划执行情况所以比第一季度有了改进，主要是由于各厂检查和总结了第一季度计划的执行情况，并且比较广泛地发动职工讨论了第二季度计划及分月计划，有些厂矿并在车间、工段甚至小组中推行了作业计划。同时，由于政治教育的加强和安全卫生设施的改善，劳动纪律一般也加强了。例如济南第四机器厂在总结第一季度的生产计划完成的情况之后，就发动职工进行总结评比，提出了“三评（评计划、评质量、评安全），两找（找原因、找经验）”的口号。经过该厂全体职工的努力，四、五、六三个月金属切削机床的生产都超额完成了计划。
    在上半年度生产中还有一些问题，最主要的就是不能全面地均衡地完成计划，具体表现如下：
    一、有些产品的总产量虽已完成了计划，但少数生产这些产品的工厂并未完成计划。例如电力，第二季度总产量超过计划百分之二点九，但南京电业局只完成百分之九十六点九。棉纱第二季度总产量超过计划百分之一点六二，但国营上海第十八棉纺织厂只完成百分之九十七点九三。
    二、前松后紧的现象也还未克服。上海电机厂六月二十八日检查六月份计划时，发现发电机未完成计划，电动机缺少三千六百瓩，变压器缺少三万五千千伏安，虽然召开紧急会议，连夜突击，六月份产品计划仍未完成。
    三、在制品及半制品的生产未能完成或完成得极不均衡。通用机器厂四月份商品产值完成了计划，但在制品及半制品并未按计划完成，因而影响了五月份商品产值未能完成计划。而六月份该厂的在制品、半制品仍未完成计划。
    上半年度生产中的第二个问题，是有些产品的质量很差。第二季度在钢铁、纺织方面的产品质量虽较第一季度有了提高，但仍有少数厂没有什么改进。例如国营上海第十一棉纺织厂的断头率和次布率还很高。在机器厂方面，制成品的质量，特别是铸件的质量还不能很好地掌握。例如无锡机器厂汽缸套的报废率曾高达百分之六十四。
    第三个问题是技术设计还不够慎重，零件管理还比较混乱。这主要表现在图样错误及零件供应脱节两方面。
    上半年生产中的第四个问题是劳动纪律问题。在第二季度中，多数厂的劳动纪律已有一定程度的加强，但部分厂仍存在着相当严重的问题。
    上半年生产中的第五个问题是设备检修还未引起应有的重视，技术规程和操作规程未能被普遍地严格地遵守，以致事故很多，特别是在钢铁厂方面，设备事故是一个相当普遍而严重的问题，六月份表现得更突出。亚细亚钢铁厂烧毁了一只电炉变压器，以致钢锭产量减少三分之一。
    根据上述情况，华东地区国营企业及公私合营企业在今后应认真加强计划管理，提高企业管理水平，加强政治工作。
    西南区
    西南区五十二个主要国营及公私合营厂矿中，有一○二厂、一○四厂、五○五厂、云南锡业公司等三十二个厂矿，超额完成了上半年生产计划。另有四川水泥厂、四○五煤矿、会泽铅锌厂等十八个厂矿，没有完成上半年主要产品计划。上述各厂矿生产的二十六种主要产品中，有十八种主要产品超额完成了上半年产量计划。在产品质量方面，部分产品已有显著改进。钢锭质量按规定标准合格率应为百分之九十六，一○一厂已达到百分之九十八点四六。电铜质量亦超过规定标准，一○三厂电铜含铜已达百分之九十九点九八。但是，西南工业产品质量绝大多数尚未达到标准，部分产品质量仍然很坏。如纺织系统除六一一纱厂纱的质量已达甲级纱外，多数厂所纺的纱都在乙等以下，五月份六一○厂纱的质量甚至降到丁等。
    西南区主要厂矿能够大部超额完成上半年度生产计划的主要原因是：第一、进行了生产改革，并从第二季度开始普遍发动群众讨论了计划，使领导与工人群众都树立起完成国家计划的观念，发挥了工人的积极性和创造性。同时在讨论计划的基础上，逐步建立计划管理，企业管理水平有了提高，因此，在一、二月份，西南百分之七十以上厂矿都没有完成计划，但到五、六月份，已有百分之七十以上的厂矿完成了计划。第二、大部厂矿领导干部都能深入车间，听取工人意见，具体解决问题，改变了过去领导干部只忙于政治运动，而忽视钻研生产的偏向。由于领导干部深入车间，面向生产，过去党、行政、工会、青年团步调不一致的现象已开始改变，并在团结一致面向生产的目标上统一起来。第三、各厂矿在不同程度上，都先后抓住并解决了自己厂内生产的关键问题，使上半年的产量与质量得到改进，使完成国家计划有了具体保证。
    目前各厂矿管理工作，还有许多缺点，仍然未摆脱混乱状态。这表现在：一、计划管理制度不健全，许多厂矿都还没有认真建立作业计划，除一○一厂、六○六厂外，各厂矿所订计划大都流于形式。到目前为止，许多厂矿仍未搞原始记录与定额工作，主要指标记录不正确，而定额数字有的仍然是去年的，不能反映目前实际生产情况。二、生产时松时紧，工序前后脱节，不平衡现象非常严重。有些厂矿不是停工待料，就是上旬忙检修，下旬加班赶任务，生产极不均衡。三、生产中由于各职能科分工不明确，无人负责的现象严重。加上有些厂矿尚无健全的设备、检修制度和维护制度以及部件工具的更换制度，以致事故不断发生。四○一、四○五等六个煤矿，在上半年中曾发生大小事故一千二百九十七次，严重影响了产量与质量。今后，西南各厂矿，必须加强计划管理，健全和建立责任制度与作业计划，使生产均衡进行。
