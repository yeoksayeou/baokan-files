    The Second National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League, held not long ago, clearly defined the League's guidelines and tasks during the national construction period. To better accomplish these glorious and enormous tasks, we must first rely on the vast number of League cadres. Therefore, the work of training cadres is an important issue in the League's work.

    But how can the League organizations effectively train League cadres, and how can League cadres better cultivate their qualities and style? In this regard, we must learn from the successful experience of the Soviet Union. The eighteen essays collected in the book "On the Qualities and Style of Young League Cadres" are selected and translated from editorials and special articles published in the Soviet magazine "Young Bolshevik" (now renamed "Young Communist") and the "Young Communist League Truth Newspaper." The book provides specific analysis and profound discussion on some of the main issues in cultivating cadres and the qualities and style of League cadres. Therefore, studying this book will be of great help to our League cadres and the vast number of young people.

    Regarding cadre training, the book emphasizes the following issues: First, cadre training is inseparable from the correct selection of cadres. The criteria for selecting cadres are political quality and professional ability, and neither should be neglected. This is a principle that Comrade Stalin established long ago, and no one will deny it. However, in actual implementation, some of our local League organizations still have some problems. When it comes to promoting a cadre, they often only focus on their seniority; otherwise, they are afraid that those with "older" or equal "qualifications" will "have opinions." This one-sided understanding of cadres has nothing in common with Comrade Stalin's instruction that "leaders should not rely on hearsay or documents, but should seriously understand these qualities through daily observation based on work and regular examination of their work." Therefore, the book repeatedly and sharply criticizes this erroneous view and emphasizes that League leaders should often face grassroots cadres and League members, understand them, cultivate them, and boldly promote those cadres who are loyal to the Party's cause and have practical abilities.

    Second, it is necessary to correctly educate cadres and care about their work and study, especially the study of Marxism-Leninism. A leader must have strict requirements for cadres and provide practical and specific guidance and assistance. Whether it is for "experienced" and young cadres, "big cadres" and "small cadres," there must be strict requirements, and there must be no discounts because of status and achievements. Conniving at or shielding cadres' shortcomings and mistakes is actually a criminal act. If "...it is believed that strict requirements are only necessary for poor workers. This is completely incorrect and harmful. Any worker, no matter how much experience and ability he has, is inevitably flawed. If there is a lack of strict requirements, the result will be that originally good cadres will become proud, selfish, and mediocre people with no future because they cannot treat their work with a critical attitude." In addition, to specifically guide their work, to often understand the difficult problems in their work, and to help them solve them in a timely manner, and to help them concentrate and summarize the experience in their work, is a practical and effective method of training cadres. These problems not only exist in our League organizations, but are also relatively serious in some places.

    What issues should League cadres mainly pay attention to in cultivating their qualities and style? The book also provides detailed discussion on this.

    First, they must have a high sense of responsibility, which is one of the important qualities of League cadres. This means that League cadres must not only work with peace of mind, but also never be satisfied, actively study, and give play to their creativity to do their work well. Because educating the younger generation in the spirit of communism and cultivating new people—fighters for the cause of the Party—is an important part of the entire cause of our Party. This requires every League cadre to regard the work of the League as a glorious cause and "contribute all their strength, knowledge, enthusiasm, and ability." However, among our League cadres, some people believe that "there is nothing to do in the League's work, and nothing can be accomplished." They are not at ease, or they are satisfied with the status quo and no longer study and improve their work. This is obviously an insufficient understanding of the importance of the League's work.

    The presence or absence and strength or weakness of a sense of responsibility does not depend on what is said, but on practical actions. This requires: both a responsible attitude and real skills. The only way to improve ability and skill is to study. Unwillingness to study is a lack of responsibility. What to study? First of all, it is necessary to tirelessly study Marxism-Leninism and study the Party's policies. Otherwise, they will not be able to comprehensively analyze the situation, will not be able to grasp the essential problems in their work in a timely manner, will not be able to distinguish right from wrong, will lack foresight, and therefore their work will not be done well or even fail. As Comrade Stalin taught us: "The higher the political level and Marxist-Leninist awareness of the staff, the higher the work itself, the more effective it is, and the more effective the results of the work; conversely, the lower the political level and Marxist-Leninist awareness of the staff, the more delays and failures in the work, the more the staff themselves will become short-sighted villains, degenerate into some narrow-minded pragmatists who only seek immediate interests, and they will be more likely to degenerate and betray—this is a theorem." Of course, in order to better study Marxism-Leninism, it is also necessary to constantly improve their cultural and knowledge level. At the same time, every League cadre should admit and dare to face the fact that today, the vast number of League members and young people are progressing rapidly, and the masses' demands on us are increasing day by day. If we do not work hard to study and improve our theoretical and policy level and cultural and knowledge level, then what will we use to educate young people and lead young people forward? It is wrong to excuse oneself for being busy with work and not having time to study, because we cannot oppose learning and work. "The purpose of learning knowledge is to apply it," to overcome the difficulties, shortcomings, and mistakes in the work, and to do the work better; moreover, our method of learning is mainly to learn from work. Of course, there will be difficulties in the learning process, but as long as there is a conscious learning requirement, any difficulty can be overcome.

    Another indispensable quality of League cadres is to have a high degree of principle. They must be absolutely loyal and honest to the Party, and they must have strict requirements for themselves and others. It is naturally an unacceptable and shameful act to conceal and hide one's shortcomings and mistakes, and it is also self-destructive. But it is not enough to only boldly expose shortcomings and admit mistakes, they must also actively overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes. The book also sharply points out: If, regarding criticism from others, especially from below, they "only verbally acknowledge the correctness of the criticism but do not make efforts to eliminate the shortcomings, it is essentially a disguised form of suppressing criticism." On the other hand, if anyone shields, covers up, or acts as a "good old fellow" with a liberal attitude of "peace and security" towards the shortcomings and mistakes of others, it is an extremely irresponsible manifestation towards the Party and comrades. The attitude towards criticism and self-criticism is one of the most important signs to measure a League cadre's principles, political level, and ideological level.

    League cadres should have a realistic spirit and carry things that have been started through to the end. To this end, they must pay attention to: before deciding to carry out a work, they must fully and clearly understand its necessity and purpose, and carefully consider whether it is practical and feasible to do so. In the process, "they must be good at finding the main things in the work, do not waste their strength on trivial matters, and look forward and far ahead." But even more important is: they must have a full estimate of the possible difficulties before the event, and when encountering difficulties, they should actively find ways to overcome the difficulties without wavering and persevere in the work to the end. Otherwise, even if the resolutions and plans are correct, they will be suspended due to obstacles. And many of our League cadres lack this realistic spirit, and in their work they often grab a handful, "start strong and finish weak," and "have arrangements but no results"; when encountering difficulties, they only complain, and attribute the failure to do the work well to "too many objective difficulties," all of which are wrong.

    Adhere to the principle of persuasive education and promote the fine style of specific leadership, and therefore we must eliminate and prevent commandism, bureaucracy, and formalism. The method of persuasive education is one of the fundamental principles of the League's work. The success of any work ultimately depends on the strength of the masses, conscious behavior, initiative, and creativity. This requires that before carrying out a work, we must, through patient persuasive education, enable every young person to understand: why it is required to carry out this work, what are the difficulties, and how can it be done well. Only in this way can we truly mobilize the masses. It is true that no one denies this principle, but not everyone can truly understand it. Even many people (especially some grassroots League cadres) often not only fail to adopt the method of patient persuasive education to the young masses, but adopt the method of coercion. This will inevitably block the enthusiasm and creativity of the cadres and masses below, and thus inevitably lead to the failure of the work. Why does a person commit the mistake of commandism? The main reason is that he lacks cultural knowledge, does not have the ability to persuade others, but is arrogant and does not respect the masses. Bureaucrats and formalists are political lazy people who seriously lack a sense of political responsibility. They do not understand or dare to admit that "the plans drawn up in the office are far from the actual life and the current urgent problems. The easy way is often not the right way." They think they know everything and there is no need to learn from the masses. In their view, contacting the masses is not an inner desire, but a troublesome obligation. They lack the qualities that leaders should have and cannot hold any position in the League. Commandism, bureaucracy, and formalism are the biggest enemies of League leaders. Therefore, we must resolutely overcome it and prevent it at all times.

    The collective leadership system is one of the most important principles in the League's work. Without the strength and wisdom of the collective, the results of any work are unimaginable. However, in many of our League organizations, there are cases of violating this principle. How can we give play to the role of collective leadership? The League Committee meeting should be held regularly, and the decision on any major issue must be discussed and approved by the Standing Committee or the Executive Committee, the Congress of League Members or the Congress of Representatives, and must be formally approved only when more than half of the members or representatives attending the meeting are present. The League Committee Secretary or a few people must never make decisions without authorization. On the other hand, if the members or representatives attending the meeting do not engage in serious discussion on the issues raised at the meeting and take an irresponsible liberal attitude, it is not allowed. At the same time, we must carefully listen to the voices of the young masses and be good at concentrating the wisdom and experience of the masses. Only in this way can we make practical and feasible resolutions and correctly carry out leadership work. Of course, this does not mean that any issue must be discussed at a meeting. Implementing collective leadership must also be responsible for one's own work. This means that the work issues within one's own responsibility should still be resolved by individuals, and they should not be shirked or afraid to take responsibility.

    Caring about the young masses and having the closest connection with them is the source of the vitality of the Youth League's work. This requires League cadres to first of all have an attitude of love, trust, and respect for the young masses, and absolutely not obliterate the different personalities, hobbies... of the youth. Without acknowledging this point, it is impossible to truly understand the masses, correctly lead the masses, and therefore it is impossible to carry out the work smoothly. We must never forget this principle at any time: only by truly understanding the masses can we truly and effectively care for and educate the masses; only by actually caring for the masses, rather than stopping at empty shouts, can we gain the true trust of the masses; only when the masses truly trust you will they be willing to tell you everything in their hearts, and you can truly understand them. Unfortunately, many of our League cadres do not understand this principle, or are afraid of trouble and unwilling to do so. The book also points out: On the one hand, the shortcomings and mistakes of League members or young masses should be criticized in a timely manner, and active efforts should be made to help them thoroughly correct them; on the other hand, they must never be blamed blindly, lightly punished, or take a discriminatory attitude. In short, caring for and loving the young masses is the inescapable responsibility of League cadres. An editorial in the "Young Communist League Truth Newspaper" said it well: "To understand the life of young people well, to care about the interests and aspirations of young people, to share the happiness and achievements with young people, and to help young people overcome difficulties and misfortunes. To be in constant contact with young people, solicit their opinions, and talk to them without restraint, this is not a boring and difficult obligation in the eyes of a veritable League cadre, but an inner desire." That is to say, whoever is unwilling to do so cannot be considered a "veritable League cadre."

    Finally, because this book is a compilation of various articles, it is impossible to discuss all the issues regarding cadre training and the qualities and style of cadres, which needs to be explained.

    介绍“论青年团干部的品质和作风”
    蔚民
    中国青年出版社编辑出版  新华书店总经售
    不久以前召开的中国新民主主义青年团第二次全国代表大会，明确地规定了团在国家建设时期的方针任务。为要更好地完成这些光荣的巨大的任务，首先就须依靠广大团的干部。因此，培养干部的工作，是团的工作中的一个重要问题。
    但是，团的组织如何才能有效地培养团的干部，以及团的干部如何才能更好地锻炼自己的品质作风呢？在这方面我们必须学习苏联的成功经验。“论青年团干部的品质和作风”这本书所收集的十八篇论文，都是从苏联“青年布尔什维克”（现改名青年共产党人）杂志、“青年团真理报”上所发表的社论和专论中选译出来的。书中对培养干部和团的干部品质作风方面的一些主要问题，都作了具体的分析和深刻的论述。因此，学习这本书，对我们团的干部和广大青年会有不少帮助的。
    关于培养干部方面，书中着重指出这样几个问题：首先，培养干部和正确地选拔干部是分不开的。选拔干部的标准是政治品质和业务能力，两者不可偏废，这是斯大林同志早已确定的原则，是谁也不会否认的。但是在实际执行的时候，我们有一些地方团组织还是存在一些问题的。当要提拔一个干部的时候，他们往往只是着眼于他的资历；不然，生怕比这个干部“资格老”或具有同等“资格”的人“有意见”。这种片面地了解干部的方法，和斯大林同志所指出的“领导者应不凭听闻，不凭纸面，而是认真地根据工作来作日常观察，根据对这些人工作上的经常考查，来了解他们的这些品质”，是毫无共同之点的。所以，书中反复地尖锐地批评了这种错误观点。并强调指出：团的领导干部，应该经常地面向下层干部和团员群众，了解他们，培养他们，大胆地把那些忠实党的事业又有实际能力的干部提拔上来。
    其次，必须正确地教育干部，关心他们的工作和学习，特别是马克思列宁主义的学习。一个领导者对干部既要有严格的要求，又要给予切实具体的指导和帮助。不管是对“有经验的”和年轻的、“大干部”和“小干部”，都要有严格的要求，绝不能因为地位和功绩而打折扣。姑息或包庇干部的缺点和错误，实际上就是一种罪恶的行为。如果“……认为只有对于不好的工作者才有严格要求的必要。这完全是不正确的，而且是有害的见解。任何一个工作者，不论他有多少经验和多大能力，也免不了有缺点。如果缺乏严格的要求，结果就会使本来是很好的干部，因为不能用批评的态度对待自己的工作，而开始骄傲起来，变为无前途的自私自利者和庸人。”另外，要具体地领导他们的工作，经常了解他们工作中的困难问题，并及时帮助解决，帮助他们把工作中的经验集中总结起来，这是一种实际有效的培养干部的方法。这些问题在我们团的组织中，不仅是存在的，而且在有些地方还是比较严重的。
    团的干部在品质和作风的锻炼上，主要地应该注意什么问题呢？对此，书中也作了详细的论述。
    首先，必须有高度的责任感，这是团的干部的重要品质之一。这就是说，团的干部不仅要安心工作，而且还要永不满足，积极地钻研，发挥创造性，把自己的工作切实做好。因为，以共产主义精神教育青年一代，培养新人——为党的事业而奋斗的战士，是我们党的整个事业中重要的一部分。这就要求每个团的干部，把团的工作作为一种光荣的事业，“拿出全部力量、知识、热情和能力来”。然而，在我们团的干部中，有些人却认为“团的工作没啥做头，搞不出什么名堂来”。他们不安心，或者是满足现状，不再去钻研和改进自己的工作。这显然就是对团的工作的重要性认识不足。
    责任感的有无和强弱，不是靠嘴上说的，而是要靠实际行动。这就得：既要有负责的态度，又要有真实的本领。提高能力和本领的唯一方法就是学习。不愿学习，就是缺乏责任感。学习什么呢？首先是要不倦地学习马克思列宁主义，学习党的政策。否则，就不能全面地分析情况，不会及时抓住工作中的本质问题，无法辨别是非，缺乏远见，因而工作就搞不好，甚至要遭到失败。正如斯大林所教导我们的：“工作人员底政治水准和马列主义觉悟程度愈高，工作本身也愈高，愈有成效，工作底结果也愈有效力；反过来说，工作人员底政治水准和马列主义觉悟程度愈低，工作中的延误和失败也愈多，工作人员本身也会愈加变为鼠目寸光的小人，堕落成为一些只图眼前利益的事务主义者，而他们也就愈易蜕化变节，——这要算是一个定理。”当然，为了更好学习马克思列宁主义，也就必须不断地提高自己的文化知识水平。同时，每一个团干部都应该承认并敢于正视这样的事实：今天，广大的团员和青年都在飞快地进步着，群众对我们的要求，是一天比一天更加提高了。如果我们现在还不去努力学习，提高自己的理论政策水平和文化知识水平，那么将拿什么去教育青年、带领青年前进呢？藉口工作忙而没有时间学习是错误的，因为我们不能把学习和工作对立起来。“学习知识的目的全在运用”，是为了克服工作中的困难、缺点和错误，为了把工作做得更好；而且，我们的学习方法，主要的是从工作中学习。自然，在学习的过程中是会有困难的，不过，只要有了自觉的学习要求，就能克服任何困难。
    团的干部的另一个不可缺少的品质，就是要有高度的原则性。对党要绝对地忠诚老实，对己对人都要有严格的要求。掩饰和隐瞒自己的缺点和错误，自然是不能容许的可耻行为，同时也是自取毁灭。但只能大胆地揭露缺点、承认错误还是不够的，还必须积极地去克服缺点、改正错误。书中并尖锐地指出：对别人、特别是来自下面的批评，如果“仅在口头上承认批评的正确性而不努力去消除缺点，实质上就是一种变相的压制批评。”另一方面，对待别人的缺点错误，谁要是碍于情面，包庇、打掩护，或是装作“好好先生”，采取“相安无事”的自由主义态度，那就是对党、对同志的一种极不负责的表现。对待批评与自我批评的态度，就是衡量一个团的干部的原则性、政治水平思想水平的最主要标志之一。
    团的干部应该具有求实精神，要把已经开了头的事情贯彻到底。为此，就必须注意：在决定进行一件工作之前，定要全面地明确认识它的必要性和目的性，并慎重地考虑这样做是不是切实可行。在进行中，“要善于在工作中找出主要的东西，不要把力量浪费到琐碎的事情上，要向前看，向远处看。”但是更重要的还是：事前对可能发生的困难要有充分估计，遇到困难时，应该毫不动摇地积极地去想办法战胜困难，把工作坚持进行到底。否则，即使决议、计划是正确的，也会因困难阻碍而中止。而我们有不少团的干部正是很缺乏这种求实精神，在工作上往往是乱抓一把，“虎头蛇尾”，“有布置无结果”；遇到困难，只是叫苦连天，没把工作做好就委之于“客观困难太多”，所有这些都是不对的。
    坚持说服教育的原则，发扬具体领导的优良作风，因而就必须铲除和防止命令主义、官僚主义和文牍主义。说服教育的方法，是团的工作的根本原则之一。任何一件工作的成功，最后都要取决于群众的力量、自觉的行为、积极性和创造性。这就要求我们在进行一件工作之前，一定要通过耐心的说服教育，让每一个青年群众都能了解：为什么要求进行这件工作，有些什么困难，怎样才能做好。只有这样，才能真正地把群众发动起来。不错，这个道理是没有人不承认的，但并不是每人都能真正地理解。甚至有不少人（尤其是有些团的基层干部），对青年群众往往不仅不能采取耐心的说服教育的方法，而且是采取强迫命令的方法。这样势必要闭塞下面干部和群众的积极性和创造性，因而就不免要招致工作的失败。一个人为什么会犯命令主义的错误呢？其主要原因，还不是由于他缺乏文化知识，没有说服别人的本领，而是由于狂妄自大，不尊重群众。官僚主义和文牍主义者是政治上的懒汉，严重地缺乏政治责任感。他们不了解或者是不敢承认：“在办公室里拟定的方案，一定和实际生活与目前迫切的问题距离得很远。容易走的道路，往往不是正确的道路。”他们认为自己什么都知道，并没有向群众学习的必要。在他们看来，联系群众并不是出于内心的要求，而是烦难的义务。他们缺乏领导者应有的品质，是不能担任团的任何工作的。命令主义、官僚主义和文牍主义，是团的领导者最大的敌人。所以，我们必须坚决地克服它，时刻地防止它。
    集体领导制是团的工作中最重要的原则之一。每一件工作，离开了集体的力量和智慧，其结果都是不可想像的。但是在我们不少的团组织中，违反这个原则的情形，并不是没有的。怎样才能发挥集体领导的作用呢？要定时召开团委会议，任何重大问题的决定，都要经过常委会或执行委员会、团员代表会议或代表大会的讨论通过，而且必须在出席会议的委员或代表超过半数以上的情况下才能正式通过，绝不能由团委书记个人或少数人来擅自决定。另一方面，如果出席会议的委员或代表们，在会上对所提出的各项问题不展开认真的讨论，采取不负责任的自由主义态度，那是不能允许的。同时，必须细心地倾听青年群众的呼声，善于集中群众的智慧和经验。只有这样，才能作出切实可行的决议，才能正确地进行领导工作。当然，这并不是说，任何问题都非要经过会议讨论不可。实行集体领导同时还要分工负责。这就是说，在自己责任范围内的工作问题，还是要由个人来负责解决的，不能推诿，害怕负责任。
    关心青年群众，和他们有最密切的联系，这是青年团工作活跃的源泉。这就要求团的干部，首先对青年群众抱着热爱、信任和尊重的态度，绝对不能抹煞青年的各不相同的个性、爱好……。不承认这一点，就无法真正了解群众、正确领导群众，因而也就不能顺利地进行工作。我们在任何时候都不要忘记这个道理：只有真正地了解群众，才能真正有效地去关心和教育群众；只有实际地去关心群众，而不是停留在口头上的空喊，才能取得群众真正的相信；只有群众真正相信你了，他们才肯把内心里的话全都告诉你，你才能真正地了解他们。可惜得很，我们还有不少团的干部却不了解这个道理，或者是怕麻烦不愿这样做。书中也指出：对团员或青年群众的缺点错误，一方面应该及时地进行批评，并积极设法帮助他们彻底改正；另一方面，又绝对不能一味指责，轻率地加以处分，或采取歧视的态度。总之，关心爱护青年群众，这是团的干部义不容辞的责任。“青年团真理报”的一篇社论中说得好：“很好地了解青年生活，关怀青年的兴趣和志向，同青年共享快乐和成就，帮助青年克服困难和不幸。常和青年接触，征求他们的意见，毫无拘束地和他们谈话，这在名副其实的团干部看来，并不是枯燥而烦难的义务，而是出于内心的要求。”这就是说，谁要不愿这样做，那他不能算是一个“名副其实的团干部”。
    最后，由于这本书是各篇文章编集起来的，它也就不可能把关于培养干部、干部的品质作风方面所有的问题都论述到，这是需要加以说明的。
