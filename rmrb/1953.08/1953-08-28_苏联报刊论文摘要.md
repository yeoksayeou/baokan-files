　　Abstracts of Soviet Newspaper Articles

　　Collectivity in Work is the Highest Principle of Leadership

　　The “Teacher” newspaper published an editorial on August 1st, pointing out the importance of strengthening collectivity in work in all departments of national education in the Soviet Union. The abstract is as follows:

　　Collectivity in work is the highest principle of Party leadership. The strength of the Party lies in its connection with the masses, its ability to listen to the opinions of the masses, and its ability to draw practical and political lessons from criticism, especially from bottom-up criticism.

　　However, in some departments of national education, a style incompatible with the original spirit of Soviet institutions has formed. Some leaders of institutions are arrogant, do not accept criticism, and do not consider the opinions of the collective. They do not recognize collectivity in work, act arbitrarily in everything, and like to treat the staff of their institutions with orders, scolding, and rude methods. However, rudeness and scolding, administrative orders, have nothing in common with the principles of Party leadership and the true strict requirements for cadres.

　　The unwillingness to listen to the opinions of the masses and the unwillingness to use the collective experience of teachers is also manifested in the fact that the committees in many departments of national education have been ineffective for a long time. However, the purpose of establishing these committees is precisely to enable them to help successfully implement the decisions of the Party and the government.

　　At various meetings convened in many departments of national education, criticism is mostly directed from top to bottom against grassroots staff, but bottom-up criticism is rarely heard.

　　Great creativity is hidden in the masses. Educational institutions that strive to rely on the masses, promote their creativity, and study the diverse experiences accumulated by teachers can successfully complete the tasks they face. An effective way to absorb teachers to actively participate in solving important issues in national education is the traditional teachers' conference. It is at these meetings that teachers should make strong criticisms and practical suggestions regarding the shortcomings of the work of schools and leading institutions. All efforts should be made to improve the level and role of teacher conferences, and the resolutions of the conferences and teachers' criticisms should become the focus of attention of all departments of national education.

　　The power of collectivity in work also lies in the fact that the adoption of any decision is carefully considered and takes into account the opinions of the vast majority of teachers. Separating from the masses and being unwilling to consider the interests of the working people will lead to bureaucracy and will inevitably lead to the failure of the work. If the leaders of the national education departments are isolated from teachers and schools, they will lose their sense of reality, fall behind life, and will try to make up for their lack of prestige with simple administrative means.

　　The Work of Receiving Visitors

　　The "Whistle" newspaper published an editorial on July 18th, pointing out that the leaders of each railway system's enterprises and institutions should attach importance to the work of receiving visitors. The abstract is as follows:

　　Every leader, regardless of his position, must establish a system in the enterprise and institution he leads so that any question raised by any visiting citizen can be quickly answered in detail and obtain the necessary assistance.

　　Receiving visitors is an important and unavoidable task closely related to the interests of the working masses. This work does not only refer to formally stipulating reception hours and determining the number of visitors received within a certain time. It primarily refers to treating each visitor's request sensitively and attentively, and promptly satisfying his reasonable requests without delay.

　　The economic leaders, Party, and political workers of the transportation department should try to ensure that the work of receiving visitors is well arranged and carry out a struggle against bureaucracy and procrastination.

　　However, regrettably, some leaders still treat this work with a bureaucratic attitude. They believe that talking to people and listening to their requests and opinions is a troublesome task that is not within their responsibilities. Such bureaucrats often push the work of talking with visitors to their assistants, agents, and secretaries, while they avoid direct contact with the working people.

　　When visitors make requests, some leaders, fearing to take responsibility, are unwilling to make decisions even on the simplest issues, and try to push the responsibility to other staff members. This creates an intolerable phenomenon of hateful procrastination, causing people to go from office to office for weeks or months, receiving only the same indifferent reply: "This is not our department's business."

　　Party organizations and political departments should resolutely fight against this irresponsible phenomenon and severely punish those bureaucrats and office workers who harm the inviolable rights of the Soviet people.

　　The Communist Party teaches us that leading cadres should treat Soviet people with a sensitive and caring attitude. The Party organizations and political departments of the transportation department must educate all railway workers with a spirit of respecting people and being extremely concerned about satisfying the legitimate demands of visitors. A Soviet person should encounter a warm and caring reception in all transportation enterprises and institutions.

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    苏联报刊论文摘要
     工作的集体性是领导的最高原则
    “教师”报八月一日发表社论，指出在苏联国民教
    育各部门中，加强工作集体性的重要，摘要如下：
    工作的集体性是党的领导的最高原则。党的力量就在于它和群众的联系，善于倾听群众的意见，善于从批评、特别是自下而上的批评中，吸取实际的和政治的教训。
    但是在某些国民教育部门中，却形成了一种和苏维埃机构的原有精神不相容的、极端恶劣的作风。有些机关的领导人自高自大，不接受批评，不考虑集体的意见。他们不承认工作的集体性，遇事独断独行，喜欢用命令、叱责和粗暴手段来对待本机关的工作人员。但是，粗暴和叱责、行政命令，是和党的领导原则，和对干部的真正严格要求，没有任何共同之处。
    不愿倾听群众的意见，不愿利用教师们的集体经验，也表现在国民教育中许多部门的委员会长期不起作用这件事实上。可是建立这些委员会的目的，却正是为了要使它们能帮助顺利实现党和政府的决定。
    在国民教育的许多部门所召集的各种会议上，批评大多是由上而下地针对基层工作人员而发的，但自下而上的批评却几乎听不到。
    伟大的创造力潜藏于群众中。各个教育机关竭力依靠群众，发扬他们的创造性，研究由教师们所积累起来的多方面的经验，就能顺利完成它们所面临的任务。吸收教师们积极参加对国民教育中重要问题的解决的有效方式，便是那具有传统性的教师会议。正是在这些会议上，教师们应当针对学校和领导机关的工作缺点，提出有力的批评，并提供实际的建议。应以全力提高教师会议的水平和作用，应使会议的决议和教师的批评意见成为国民教育各部门的注意中心。
    工作的集体性的力量也在于它能使任何一个决定的采纳，都经过深思熟虑，都能顾及广大的教师群众的意见。脱离群众，不愿考虑劳动人民的利益，就会产生官僚主义，并必然会使工作失败。国民教育各部门的领导人如果同教师和学校相隔绝，就会丧失对现实的感觉，落在生活后面，就会企图以单纯的行政手段来弥补自己的威信的不足。
    接见来访者的工作
    “汽笛”报七月十八日发表社论，指出每个铁路系统的企业和机关的领导人员应重视接见来访者的工作，摘要如下：
    每个领导人员，不论他的职位如何，都必须在他所领导的企业和机关中建立一种制度，使每个来访的公民所提出的任何问题，都能迅速获得详尽的答复并取得必要的帮助。
    接见来访者是同劳动群众利益密切相关的不容推诿的重要工作。这项工作不仅是指正式规定接见时间，和确定在一定时间中被接见的来访者的人数。这首先是指，要敏感而用心地对待每个来访者的要求，并毫不延宕地迅速满足他的合理要求。
    运输部门的经济领导人员、党和政治工作人员，应当设法使接见来访者的工作得到良好的安排，并同官僚主义和拖沓作风的现象展开斗争。
    但，遗憾的是，有一些领导人员仍在以官僚主义的态度对待这项工作，他们认为和人们谈话，倾听他们的请求和意见，是一种麻烦的、非自己分内的工作。这类官僚常常把同来访者谈话的工作推给自己的助手、代理者和秘书，而自己则规避同劳动人民直接接触。
    在来访者提出请求时，有些领导人员因为怕负责任，甚至对最简单的问题也不肯作出决定，竭力把责任推给其他工作人员。这就会产生不能令人容忍的可恶的延宕不决现象，使人一连几星期，几个月地从这办公室转向那办公室，而得到的只是同一冷漠的答复：“这不是我们部门的事。”
    党组织和政治部应当坚决地同这种不负责任的现象进行斗争，并严厉地处罚那些损害苏联人的不可侵犯权利的官僚和具有衙门作风的工作者。
    共产党教导我们领导干部要以敏感的、关怀的态度对待苏联人。运输部门的党组织和政治部必须以敬重人的精神、极端关怀于满足来访者的合法要求的精神，教育全体铁路工作人员。一个苏联人应当在所有运输部门的企业和机关中遇到热情而关怀的接待。
