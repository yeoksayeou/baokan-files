Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: TASS, New York, August 22nd: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee held a meeting on the afternoon of August 21st. Because no one wanted to speak at the afternoon session on August 21st and the morning session on August 22nd, Chairman Muniz adjourned the Political Committee's meeting until the morning of August 24th.
   Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd: TASS, New York, August 22nd: The United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee held a meeting on the morning of August 21st to continue discussing the Korean issue. The statements made by the representatives at the meeting once again demonstrated that the United States' attempt to compose the political conference of belligerent parties only, and to prevent certain countries which, although not participating in the Korean War, are extremely concerned about a proper resolution of the Korean issue from participating, is a policy that does not receive the support of many countries.
    U.S. Representative Lodge distributed a special statement to the representatives of various countries on the evening of August 20th. The statement emphasized that the U.S. delegation would vote against the suggestion of inviting India to participate in the political conference. The purpose of his doing this was obviously to exert pressure on other national delegations.
    Swedish Representative Sandler was the first to speak at the Political Committee meeting. He said that the composition of the political conference should not be based on the principle of belligerent parties. He said that the Swedish delegation would vote in favor of inviting the Soviet Union and inviting India to participate in the political conference. He said that Sweden is a member of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, therefore, the Swedish government cannot participate in the work of the political conference.
    Norwegian Representative Engen also spoke in favor of inviting the Soviet Union and India to participate in the political conference. He believed that the Soviet Union is a major power in the Far East, and without the participation of the Soviet Union, no issues could be effectively resolved at the political conference. He said that the Norwegian delegation supports inviting most of the countries proposed in the Soviet proposal to participate in the political conference, but believes that the last part of the Soviet proposal, namely the part about how the conference should pass resolutions, should be amended. But he went on to say that he would vote in favor of the Fifteen-Nation Proposal.
    Polish Delegation Head Naszkowski then spoke, stating on behalf of the Polish government and the Polish people that they were very pleased that the signing and entry into force of the Korean Armistice Agreement had ended the destructive war. He criticized the Fifteen-Nation Proposal and stated that Poland supports the Soviet proposal.
    After the representatives of Egypt, Israel, Cuba, and the Union of South Africa spoke, the Political Committee meeting adjourned.

    联大政治委员会继续讨论朝鲜问题
    波兰代表发言支持苏联提案
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：联合国大会政治委员会于二十一日下午举行会议，由于没有人要在二十一日下午会议上和在二十二日上午会议上发言，主席慕尼兹就把政治委员会的会议延期到二十四日上午再举行。
   【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：联合国大会政治委员会在八月二十一日上午举行会议，继续讨论朝鲜问题。代表们在会上的发言再度说明：美国企图使政治会议由交战双方组成，不准某些虽未参加朝鲜战争却对朝鲜问题的适当解决极为关心的国家参加，这种政策得不到许多国家的支持。
    美国代表洛奇八月二十日晚上把一份特别声明散发给各国代表。声明强调说，美国代表团将投票反对邀请印度参加政治会议的建议，他这种做法的目的显然是要对其他国家代表团施以压力。
    瑞典代表桑德勒在政治委员会会议上第一个发言。他说，政治会议的组成不应根据交战双方这一原则。他说，瑞典代表团将投票赞成邀请苏联和邀请印度参加政治会议的建议。他说，瑞典是战俘遣返委员会和中立国监察委员会的委员，因此，瑞典政府不能参加政治会议的工作。
    挪威代表恩根也发言赞成邀请苏联和印度参加政治会议。他认为，苏联是远东的一个大国，如果没有苏联参加，在政治会议上任何问题都不能得到有效的解决。他说，挪威代表团赞成邀请苏联提案所提出邀请的国家的大部分参加政治会议，不过认为苏联提案的最后一部分，即关于会议如何通过决议的那部分，应该加以修正。但是他接着又说，他将投票赞成十五国提案。
    波兰代表团团长纳希科夫斯基接着发言，他代表波兰政府和波兰人民，对于朝鲜停战协定的签订和生效终止了摧毁性的战争表示十分满意。他批评了十五国提案并表示波兰支持苏联提案。
    在埃及、以色列、古巴和南非联邦的代表发言后，政治委员会会议休会。
