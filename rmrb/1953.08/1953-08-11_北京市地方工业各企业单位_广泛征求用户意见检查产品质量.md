    Various Local Industrial Enterprises in Beijing
    Widely Solicit User Feedback and Inspect Product Quality

    More than 30 enterprises affiliated with the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Local Industry Bureau, during the quality inspection campaign, adopted methods such as user symposiums, user visits, and written solicitations of opinions to seek criticism and inspection from users regarding the enterprises' management philosophy and product quality. This effectively educated leading cadres and employees of the enterprises to value quality, improved the relationship between production and sales, and strengthened the connection between producers and consumers, thus deepening the quality inspection campaign.

    At the user symposiums, leading cadres of various enterprises criticized various erroneous management ideas. For example, the Brick and Tile Company had stipulated in its user contracts, "Pick up goods at the kiln, select in person, no returns after leaving the premises." Users had long been critical of this provision, and many disputes had occurred, but it had never been resolved. At this symposium, the company leaders inspected and criticized this incorrect business style, immediately agreed to revise the contract, and declared that for bricks already ordered but not yet picked up, the company would be responsible for arranging selection. The deputy director of supply and marketing of the Capital Timber Factory also criticized the past practice of only sending "eloquent" salespeople to deal with users who were more conscientious about acceptance inspections when he conducted user visits. User visits and other methods also had a considerable educational effect on supply and marketing and technical personnel, as well as skilled workers. For example, after user visits, a salesperson from the Capital Timber Factory realized that his past old-merchant style was "deceiving customers." Technical personnel from the Qinghe Woolen Mill stated at the meeting that in the past, they were unwilling to dye more colors, thinking it would delay production. In the future, if they were to trial-produce new products, they would definitely base it on the needs of the people. Through symposiums and user visits, everyone further clarified the consistency of being responsible to the state and being responsible to consumers.

    In the symposiums and user visits, the opinions raised by the masses were practical, responsible, and sincere, greatly helping the factories to find key points in quality inspection and improve production in the future. For example, after the Heating Equipment Factory heard the City Construction Engineering Bureau Design Institute raise issues about the heat dissipation of furnace pieces, the actual efficiency of boilers, and other users raise issues about shoddy workmanship, they identified the main problems existing in quality as "two major," "three many," and "four unknowns" ("two major" refers to significant impact and large losses; "three many" refers to many sand holes, many misaligned molds, and many flaws; "four unknowns" refers to unknown heat release, unknown coal consumption, unknown water capacity, and unknown service life). The No. 1 Engineering Company directly under North China suggested that the Brick and Tile Company should establish a system of responsibility by district, grade, and section, as well as a four-check system (the four checks are check the soil, check the mud, check the blanks, and check the firing). These opinions pointed out the direction for the Brick and Tile Company to improve its work. The Qinghe Woolen Mill also selected 51 pieces of user letters, collected 12 pieces of typical clothes, and 13 pieces of woolen fabric, and displayed them at the quality exhibition. The opinions from users outside the factory combined with the opinions of employees inside the factory, making the quality inspection a mass movement that resonated both internally and externally.

    The work of symposiums and user visits improved the relationship between production and sales units and was integrated with product sales work. The main reason why some enterprises had overstocked products in the past was, on the one hand, low quality and high cost; on the other hand, they did not have a clear understanding of sales channels and did not seriously investigate and study the needs of users. When the Qinghe Woolen Mill held a symposium, representatives from the Municipal Department Store brought some samples that consumers liked most for them to refer to. The Beijing Municipal Department Store did not purchase products from the Qinghe Woolen Mill in the first and second quarters of this year. The Qinghe Woolen Mill had always believed that this was because the company had a large backlog of imported goods, but at the symposium, it was learned that the main reason was that the company's salespersons believed that the quality was not guaranteed and did not dare to propose a plan to purchase products from the Qinghe Woolen Mill. After exchanging opinions at the symposium and visiting the factory, the company's salespersons proposed a sales plan and ordered goods from the Qinghe Woolen Mill, which was equivalent to about 90% of the factory's total output in the third quarter. After the Pharmaceutical Factory held a symposium, the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Supply Station purchased 2.6 billion yuan of spot goods from them the next day.

    The work of convening user symposiums and visiting users by various factories in Beijing began with a spirit of criticism and self-criticism, eliminating some ideological obstacles among employees. For example, when the Capital Timber Factory conducted user visits, some salespeople felt that "in the past, they only said nice things to people when delivering goods, but today they are going to ask people to point out shortcomings, which is a difficult transition." Some were afraid that the masses would demand too much, the quality would not be improved, and the business would be even more difficult in the future. After persuasion and education, their thinking was finally straightened out. Facts have also proved that these concerns were incorrect. On the contrary, users have adopted a correct and positive attitude towards quality inspection. For example, after receiving an invitation from the Printing Factory No. 1 to attend a symposium, the Youth Publishing House convened a meeting of the publishing department, printing department, and materials department in advance to prepare opinions. After the Brick and Tile Company symposium, the supply and marketing department left behind users with long-standing unresolved cases and consulted with the factory directors of the relevant kilns to discuss solutions, and agreements were reached in all cases. Most factories in Beijing made full preparations before convening symposiums and visiting users. For example, both parties had prepared in advance for the symposium between the Qinghe Woolen Mill and the Department Store. The Qinghe Woolen Mill wanted to expose quality shortcomings and overcome the conservative thinking of some people in the factory through the symposium; the Department Store also wanted to overcome the conservative thinking of salespersons who did not purchase products from the Qinghe Woolen Mill through the symposium. In this way, the symposiums achieved the desired results. Conversely, individual units were less well-prepared, and the meetings did not go well. After the symposiums, some leaders also seriously conveyed the users' opinions to the employees, so that the employees understood the users' opinions, so as to give play to everyone's enthusiasm and creativity and jointly improve the work.

    北京市地方工业各企业单位
    广泛征求用户意见检查产品质量
    北京市人民政府地方工业局所属各企业在质量检查运动中，有三十多个工厂采用了用户座谈会、用户访问、书面征求意见等方式，征求用户对企业经营思想与产品质量的批判与检查，有效地教育了各企业领导干部与职工群众重视质量，改善了产销关系，密切了生产者与消费者之间的联系，使质量检查运动深入开展。
    在用户座谈会上，各企业单位的领导干部批判了各种错误的经营思想，如砖瓦公司曾在用户的合同上规定“窑厂取货，当面挑选，出门不换”。用户对这项规定早就有意见，并曾发生不少纠纷，但一直没有解决；这次座谈会上，公司领导方面检查并批判了这种不正确的经营作风，当场答应修改合同，并声明已订未取的砖，由公司负责设法挑选。首都木材厂领导供销的副厂长在进行用户访问时，也批判了以往专派“能说善道”的业务员去对付验收比较认真的用户的做法。用户访问等方式对供销和技术人员、技术工人也起了相当的教育作用。如首都木材厂业务员经过用户访问，认识了自己过去的旧商人作风是“欺骗业主”。清河制呢厂技术人员在会上表示：过去多染几色都不愿意，以为这样会耽误生产，今后如试制新产品，一定根据人民的需要。大家通过了座谈会和用户访问，进一步明确了对国家负责和对消费者负责的一致性。
    在座谈会和用户访问中，群众所提的意见都是实际的、负责的、诚恳的，对工厂检查质量找关键和今后改进生产有很大帮助。如暖汽材料厂听了市建筑工程局设计院提出炉片散热量、锅炉实际效能问题和其他用户提出的粗制滥造等情况后，找出了“两大”“三多”和“四不知”等质量中存在的主要问题（“两大”是影响大、损失大；“三多”是砂眼多、错箱多、疵呛多；“四不知”是放热量不知、煤耗量不知、容水量不知、使用年限不知）。华北直属第一工程公司建议砖瓦公司应订分区、分等、分段负责制和四查制度（四查是查土、查泥、查坯、查火候），这些意见为砖瓦公司改进工作指出了方向。清河制呢厂还选出了用户来信五十一件，搜集了典型衣服十二件，呢料十三件，在质量展览会上展出，来自厂外用户的意见结合厂内职工群众的意见，使质量检查形成内外呼应的群众性运动。
    座谈会和用户访问的工作，改进了生产与推销单位的关系，并与产品销售工作结合了起来。有些企业单位过去积压产品的主要原因，一方面是质量低、成本高；另一方面是对销路摸不清，没有认真调查研究用户的需要。清河制呢厂举办座谈会时，市百货公司代表带了一些消费者最喜欢的样品供他们参考。北京市百货公司今年第一、二季度没有收购清河制呢厂产品，清河制呢厂一向认为是由于该公司积压进口货多，在座谈会上才知道主要原因是该公司售货员认为质量没有保证，不敢提出计划买进清河制呢厂的产品。经过座谈会交换意见，又参观了工厂，该公司售货员便提出了售货计划，向清河制呢厂订购的货，约等于该厂第三季度全部产量的百分之九十。制药厂举行座谈会后，第二天天津医药供应站向他们收购了二十六亿元的现货。
    北京市各工厂召开用户座谈会和访问用户的工作，开始即贯串着批评与自我批评的精神，扫除了职工中的一些思想障碍。如首都木材厂进行用户访问时，有的业务员觉得“过去送货专对人说好听的，今天去请人家提缺点转不过弯来”。有人怕群众要求过高，质量提不高，将来业务更不好搞了。经过说服教育，终于打通了思想。事实也证明了这些顾虑是不正确的，恰恰相反，用户对质量检查都采取了正确的积极支持的态度。如青年出版社在接到印刷一厂邀请参加座谈会后，事先曾召集出版科、印制科、材料科开了一个会准备意见；砖瓦公司座谈会后，供销科留下了长期有悬案未解决的用户，分别和有关窑厂厂长面商解决办法，结果都达成协议。北京市多数工厂在召开座谈会和访问用户的工作前都作了充分准备。如清河制呢厂和百货公司的座谈会，双方事先都有准备。清河制呢厂要通过座谈会暴露质量缺点，克服工厂某些人员的保守思想；百货公司也要通过座谈会克服售货员不进清河制呢厂产品的保守思想。这样就使座谈会都达到了预期的效果。反之，个别单位准备较差，会就开得不好。开过座谈会后，有些单位领导方面又把用户的意见向职工群众作认真的传达，使职工群众明了用户的意见，以发挥大家的积极性和创造性，共同改进工作。
