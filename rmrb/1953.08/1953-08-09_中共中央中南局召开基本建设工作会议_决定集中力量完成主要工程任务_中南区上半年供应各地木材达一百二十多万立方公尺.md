Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 8th: The CPC Central Committee Central-South Bureau convened a Basic Construction Work Conference from July 21st to 29th. This conference summarized the work of the first half of the year and revised the work plan for the second half of the year based on the actual situation.

The conference summarized the basic construction work since the Industrial and Mining Conference convened by the CPC Central Committee Central-South Bureau in January of this year. In the past six months, more than 700 Party members and cadres at the county level and above, and thousands of technicians from production factories and mines, have been transferred to basic construction positions; the number of fixed workers in basic construction throughout the region has also grown from more than 10,000 last year to more than 40,000 at present; leadership organizations and specialized construction organizations related to basic construction work have been established one after another. In terms of project progress, many basic construction units have completed their cross-year project tasks from last year; various projects this year have also started on a large scale, and the completion of project plans has improved month by month; some advanced units have even overfulfilled their project tasks for June or the first half of the year. The conference also introduced the experience of the Zhengzhou Power Plant's new construction project in plan management and political work, the Wuhan City Construction Company's promotion of Su Changyou's bricklaying method and rhythmic production according to instruction charts, and the Guangdong Zini Sugar Factory's strengthening of site management.

In order to steadily complete the basic construction tasks for the second half of the year on schedule, the conference requested that basic construction leadership departments in various regions, based on their existing strength, prioritize the important and urgent tasks, concentrate their efforts, first ensure the completion of major project tasks, and arrange some minor projects to be carried out in the spring of next year. The conference requested that the CPC provincial and municipal committees be responsible for unifying the various projects in their respective regions by the end of August, based on local human and material resources and climatic conditions, and propose specific plans to ensure the completion of the annual project tasks.

The conference pointed out that the key to completing the basic construction tasks in the second half of the year is to establish plan management in the projects. Therefore, it is required that each construction site, according to its own conditions, gradually implement major operational plans such as construction progress, equipment and materials, and labor force, from point to area and from rough to fine. Before the end of this year, various regions should also complete wage adjustments and end the democratic reform among fixed workers, in order to further mobilize the masses of workers, improve production efficiency, and effectively complete the plan.

The conference requested that the CPC provincial and municipal committees comprehensively organize forces in implementing the above work, further strengthen the unified leadership of basic construction work, and change the previous chaotic and decentralized state. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen political work on the construction sites to fully develop the potential capabilities of workers and technicians.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 8th: In the first half of this year, the Central-South Region supplied more than 1.2 million cubic meters of timber to basic construction and production units in various locations. This timber was transported from major timber producing areas such as the Yuanjiang River Basin in western Hunan, the Xiangjiang River Basin in southern Hunan, the Ganjiang River Basin in southern Jiangxi, the Beijiang area of Guangdong, Guilin and Yishan Special Zone in Guangxi, and the Dayao Mountains and Damiao Mountains. This timber is supplied to coal mines and geological exploration departments in North China, East China, Northeast China, Northwest China, and Central-South China as pit props, to railway departments in various regions as sleepers and utility poles, and to basic construction sites as construction scaffolding. Some of the timber is supplied to important factory and mining units such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Central China Iron and Steel Company. This year, the Central-South Region's supply of timber to various locations will increase by more than two times compared to 1951.

In the process of felling and transporting timber this year, the major forest areas in the Central-South Region have paid close attention to saving timber. In the past, when felling timber in the Central-South Region, the remaining tree stumps were 40 to 70 centimeters high, but this year they are mostly only around 20 centimeters, and some have even been felled flush with the ground. In the past, timber was transported by tying it into rafts using the "water eye" method (drilling holes in one end of each timber), which wasted a section of timber. Now some areas have improved the raft tying method and eliminated the "water eye." In addition, the "top wood" (the upper part of the timber), which has always been neglected, is also being studied by the local forest industry bureaus to expand its use.

The Central-South Region will focus on carrying out projects such as dredging rivers, expanding timber collection yards, and building procurement station houses and tents in the forest areas of Hunan and Guangxi to strengthen the work of felling timber and continuously supply timber to various locations.

    中共中央中南局召开基本建设工作会议
    决定集中力量完成主要工程任务
    中南区上半年供应各地木材达一百二十多万立方公尺
    【新华社武汉八日电】中共中央中南局在七月二十一日到二十九日召开了基本建设工作会议。这次会议总结了上半年的工作，并根据实际情况修订了下半年的工作计划。
    会上总结了今年元月中共中央中南局召开工矿会议以来的基本建设工作。半年来，全区有七百多个县级以上的党员干部和生产厂矿的数千个技术人员，调派到基本建设岗位上去；全区基本建设的固定工人也由去年的一万多人发展到目前的四万多人；有关基本建设工作的领导机构和专业建筑机构，已先后建立起来。在工程进度方面，许多基本建设单位已经完成了去年跨年度的工程任务；今年的各项工程也已大量开工，工程计划完成的情况逐月好转；某些先进单位并超额完成了今年六月份或上半年的工程任务。会上还介绍了郑州电厂新建工程的计划管理和政治工作、武汉市修建公司推广苏长有砌砖法和按指示图表进行有节奏的生产、以及广东紫泥糖厂加强工地管理等经验。
    为了稳步按期地完成今年下半年基本建设任务，会议要求各地基本建设领导部门根据现有力量，分别轻重缓急，集中力量，首先保证完成主要工程任务，把某些少量的次要工程有计划地安排到明年春季再施工。会议要求中共各省、市委根据当地人力、物力及气候条件，在八月底以前负责把本地区的各项工程加以统一安排，并提出保证完成全年工程任务的具体计划。
    会议指出完成下半年基本建设任务的关键是建立工程中的计划管理。因此要求各个工地根据本身条件，由点到面、由粗到细地抓住施工进度、设备材料和劳动力等主要作业计划，逐步加以贯彻。在今年年底以前，各地还要做好工资调整和结束固定工人中的民主改革工作，以便进一步发动工人群众，提高生产效率、切实完成计划。
    会议要求中共各省、市委在贯彻以上工作中，要全面组织力量，进一步加强对基本建设工作的统一领导，改变过去的零乱和分散状态。同时，还要加强工地的政治工作，以充分发挥工人和技术人员的潜在能力。
    【新华社武汉八日电】今年上半年中南区供应各地基本建设和生产单位的木材已达一百二十多万立方公尺。这些木材是从湘西沅江流域、湘南湘江流域、赣南赣江流域、广东北江区、广西桂林、宜山专区和大瑶山、大苗山等木材主要产地，辗转运出的。这些木材分别供应华北、华东、东北、西北和中南等区各煤矿和地质勘探部门做坑木，各地铁路部门做枕木和电线杆，以及基本建设工地做建筑工架。其中一部分木材是供应鞍山钢铁公司和华中钢铁公司等重要厂矿单位的。今年中南区供应各地的木材将比一九五一年增加两倍以上。
    中南区各主要林区今年在采伐和调运木材的过程中，很注意节约木材。过去中南区采伐木材，留的树墩达四、五十公分到六、七十公分高，今年大都只留墩二十公分上下，有的已经齐地采伐了。过去运输木材，都是用“打水眼”（在每根木材的一端钻孔）的办法扎成木排运出，这样要浪费一段木材，现在有的地区已经改善扎排方法，取消了“打水眼”。此外，向来不被重视的“梢头木”（木材的上半部），各地森林工业管理局也正在研究扩大它的用途。
    中南区将在湖南、广西林区有重点地兴办疏浚河道、扩建集材场和兴建采购站房舍、帐篷等工程，加强采伐木材工作，将木材源源供给各地。
