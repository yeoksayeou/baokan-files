    A Basic Construction Team is Growing
    ——Visiting the Riveting and Welding Factory of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration
    Pei Da
    At the construction site of the Harbin Large Electric Motor Factory, people are excitedly talking about one thing: "The riveting and welding installation project of the factory building's steel structure meets the standards completely and will be completed ahead of schedule." The scale of this steel structure project is very large, requiring more than 3,100 tons of steel in total, with the roof as high as a six-story building. The quality requirements of the project are very strict, and there should be no gaps between the steel plates. However, this project is being undertaken by the Riveting and Welding Factory of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration, which was newly established not long ago and whose factory director and workers have no experience. The Riveting and Welding Factory was established in May 1951, and its name at that time was the Riveting and Welding Engineering Team. Initially, it had only 341 employees, and the weight of steel used for the engineering tasks was only 1,060 tons. It was renamed Riveting and Welding Factory at the end of the year. Last year, there were 841 employees, and the workload was 2,830 tons. This year, the number of employees has increased to 1,777, and the workload has increased to 5,000 tons. There are now 36 technicians (including two workshop directors and ten team leaders), all of whom were promoted from workers last year and this year. There are two factory directors, one who was a catering worker before liberation and, after being cultivated by the Party, has now become a leading cadre; the other was a fitter and joined the People's Liberation Army as a regimental commander, and has now been transferred here to lead basic construction work. The three construction site directors are all veteran workers with more than 14 or 15 years of experience, and have also just been promoted to leadership positions.
    Construction site director Sun Jingyuan recalled the scene when this basic construction team was born: "The Riveting and Welding Engineering Team started from scratch, without even an inch of iron when it was first established. When working, tools were extremely scarce. Without pliers, we clamped the red-hot iron rods with wooden boards and immersed one end in water, wrapped it with hemp fibers, and then operated it by hand. At that time, there were no houses to live in, so the workers built them themselves. However, in just over two years, what about now? Cutting, punching, and riveting are all done by machines. In the past two years, the workers have accumulated tens of billions of yuan in funds for the country, and the employees' families have all moved into楼房 (multi-story buildings)."
    Embarking on the Road of Scientific Management
    The progress of the Riveting and Welding Factory is due to the fact that their leading cadres have studied their business and, in a short period of time, have found the central link in leading such complex work. In the second half of the year before last, the employees of the Riveting and Welding Factory did not have any plans when working, and based on experience, they estimated what work to do, when to complete it, and how many people to use, and then they just started working. When constructing the metal structure project of the medium-sized factory building, 150 people would have been enough, but based on experience, they estimated and sent 300 people. Tools were scarce, and the work surface was small, so two people did the work of one person. When the project was completed, there was no other work to do, resulting in idle labor and waste. At the end of the year, after calculating the detailed accounts, it was found that there was a lot of waste, and it was felt that it would not work without a plan. Last year, they learned from other units and established a planning section, so they had a general idea of how much work to do each year, each quarter, and each month. However, the plan was still estimated by a few people in the planning section based on experience, and the engineering tasks were greater than last year. Due to the incomplete plan, there was a large plan but no small plan, and there was often a chaotic situation of imbalance in labor, materials, equipment, and finance, and no one could be found responsible for the problems. This situation continued until this year. Not long after the start of the steel structure project of the Large Electric Motor Factory, the material consumption plan alone was added more than ten times. The original plan was for 4,000 scaffolding poles, but now more than 8,000 poles have been used; it was estimated that a riveting team would rivet 385 rivets per day, but the actual average reached more than 800, with a maximum of more than 1,200. The construction site dispatcher was also not accustomed to handling affairs according to the plan, and would transfer people to wherever there was a shortage, rarely considering the entire plan. The year before last, they did not have quality standards and operating procedures, nor did they have an inspection system, so quality accidents occurred constantly. In the second half of last year, they explored and compiled some operating procedures and established an inspection team, which avoided many quality accidents. However, the technical management of construction did not fundamentally improve. At the beginning of the riveting and welding project at the Large Electric Motor Factory site this year, accidents still occurred from time to time, such as wrongly numbered materials, cutting iron plates off the line, drilling the wrong holes, and the two holes not matching when the iron plates were pieced together.
    After going through more than two years of arduous journey, the cadres of the Riveting and Welding Factory increasingly felt that the "handling affairs based on experience" and "grasping everything" methods would not work, and they always wanted to find a way to bring together the myriad of things and make them proceed in an orderly manner. This problem found its answer in the establishment of a responsibility system. In the establishment of the technical quality responsibility system at the Riveting and Welding Factory's Large Electric Motor Factory construction site, they conducted a large-scale study. From the phenomenon of no one being responsible being exposed, and in the discussion and research of the causes of quality accidents, they began to understand that construction has certain regularities, and quality problems are no exception; correspondingly, various work systems must be established and improved, and the power of organization must be brought into play from the implementation of the systems - everything is managed by someone, and everyone is responsible for their own duties.
    After quality inspections and discussions, the workers understood that "doing work without a proper method is like a blind person riding a blind horse," and they were determined to handle affairs according to the operating procedures, and also put forward many guarantees. The workers who enlarge the drawings proposed "three no放 (let go)"：Do not放 (let go) if the drawings are unclear, do not放 (let go) if the drawings are changed without the甲方's (Party A, the client's) signature, and do not放 (let go) if the floor is uneven; the workers who number the materials proposed "three no 号 (number)"：Do not 号 (number) if the raw materials are not flat and straight, do not 号 (number) if the templates and sample rods have not been inspected, and do not 号 (number) if the quantity and specifications are unclear; the workers who cut the materials proposed "two no 切 (cut)"：Do not 切 (cut) if the number is unclear, and do not 切 (cut) if the quantity and specifications are unclear; the workers who drill the holes proposed "three no 钻 (drill)"：Do not 钻 (drill) if the number is unclear, do not 钻 (drill) if the sample hole is crooked, and do not 钻 (drill) if the specifications of the hole are unclear; the workers who assemble the materials proposed "three no 拼 (assemble)"：Do not 拼 (assemble) if the angle steel is not straight, do not 拼 (assemble) if the iron plate is not flat, and do not 拼 (assemble) if it does not conform to the drawings; the workers who rivet the materials proposed "three no 铆 (rivet)"：Do not 铆 (rivet) if the assembly is not tight, do not 铆 (rivet) if the hole is not straight, and do not 铆 (rivet) if the quality of the rivet is not good; the workers who install and hoist the materials proposed "four no 装吊 (install and hoist)"：Do not 装吊 (install and hoist) if the preparation is not good, do not 装吊 (install and hoist) if it has not been inspected, do not 装吊 (install and hoist) if the quality is not good, and do not 装吊 (install and hoist) if the signal is unclear. They also incorporated the guarantees proposed by the workers into the responsibility system. In this way, the technical management was improved and fixed from the system link by link, blocking the loopholes in quality. The result of the Riveting and Welding Factory's Large Construction Site conscientiously implementing the responsibility system was that the quality of the riveting and welding project reached 99.3%, exceeding the prescribed quality indicators.
    The Idea of "Quality First, a Century-Old Plan" is Deeply Rooted in People's Hearts
    The cadres of the Riveting and Welding Factory who came from worker backgrounds are used to being with the workers, and the office and the site are not far apart for them. They not only speak well, and the workers listen to them, but they are also willing to work hard. However, the facts of the past two years have proved that this kind of relationship alone cannot meet the requirements of the workers. Some workers said: "It's a little better when the team leader comes, but it's still the same when he leaves." In the movement to establish a responsibility system, the cadres of the Riveting and Welding Factory realized that if they want to rely on the masses, they must also educate the masses, and the education of the masses must be carried out around the central task. In the establishment of the technical quality responsibility system at the large power plant construction site, in addition to criticizing the idea of ignoring quality at the meeting, the trade union also used blackboard newspapers and radios to report the quality of each process and each team in a timely manner, commended the units and individuals with good quality, and at the same time educated the workers through the workers' practice, organized finished product quality exhibitions and image education, and organized workers to visit the new factory, so that the idea of "quality first, a century-old plan" was deeply rooted in people's hearts. In order to promote overall improvement, the Party and the trade union also cultivated typical teams and set up banners among the workers. The Wang Ligong team of the riveting team not only guaranteed the quality of their own team, but also motivated all the workers in the team, so that the average riveting quality reached 99.37%. Under this circumstance, two advanced teams and fifty-five advanced teams emerged, and the workers' inventions and innovations continued to appear. Wang Ligong's successful invention of the rivet support not only saved manpower, but also guaranteed quality. Wang Dianwen improved the wind shovel tool, increasing work efficiency by more than three times.
    Continuously Cultivating New Forces
    The Riveting and Welding Factory has taken a big step forward in the movement to establish a responsibility system, but they are not complacent and have not stopped moving forward. Factory director Zhou said: "At present, riveting and welding work is too tiring and too slow. A riveting gun weighs 24斤 (jin, a unit of weight equal to 0.5 kg), and you have to hold it and work for nine hours a day, which is really hard! Next year, we will use a lot of very lightweight welding machines, without numbering materials or drilling holes, which will be faster and more solid. This year, we are training more than 450 welders, and the number of welding machines will increase from 12 to 49. In terms of strengthening technical forces, we welcome the arrival of engineers sent by the higher authorities, and we plan to send a group of workers to quick-success middle schools, Russian language colleges, and technical schools to study this year. The larger the scale of national construction, the more steel structure projects there will be, and we must catch up with the needs of the country!"

    一支基本建设队伍在成长中
    ——访问有色金属工业管理局铆焊厂
    裴达
    哈尔滨大型电机厂工地里，人们兴奋地谈论着一件事：“厂房钢骨铆焊安装工程，质量完全合乎标准，并将提前完工。”这个钢骨工程的规模是很大的，全部工程需要钢材三千一百多吨，屋顶有六层大楼那么高。工程质量要求很严，钢板与钢板相接不允许有丝毫的空隙。但是，这个工程就是由从厂长到工人都没有经验、刚刚成立不久的有色金属工业管理局铆焊厂负责施工的。铆焊厂诞生于一九五一年五月，当时它的名字叫作铆焊工程队，最初只有职工三百四十一人，工程任务用钢材重量计算只有一千零六十吨，当年年底改称铆焊厂。去年有职工八百四十一人，工作量是两千八百三十吨。今年职工增到一千七百七十七人，工作量增加到五千吨。现在已有技术员三十六人（其中包括两个车间主任，十个队长），都是在去年和今年从工人中提拔起来的。有两个厂长，一个在解放前是饭食业的工人，解放后经过党的培养，现在成了领导干部；另一个是钳工出身，参加解放军当过团长，现在转业来到这里领导基本建设工作。三个工地主任，都是十四五年以上的老工人，也是刚提拔到领导岗位。
    工地主任孙景元回忆这支基本建设队伍诞生时的情景说：“铆焊工程队白手起家，刚成立的时候一寸铁都没有。干起活来工具非常缺乏，没有钳子，就用木板夹着烧红了的铁棍一头往水里一浸，使麻片包上，然后用手把着进行操作。当时没有房子住，工人们亲自动手盖起来。但是，仅仅两年多的光景，现在呢？切板、压眼、铆焊都使用机器操作了。两年来，工人们给国家积累了几十亿元的资金，职工家属都住上了楼房。”
    走上科学管理的道路
    铆焊厂的进步，是由于他们的领导干部钻研业务，在短期内摸到了领导这样复杂工作的中心环节。前年下半年，铆焊厂的职工干活还没有什么计划，凭经验估计，什么活、什么时候完、要多少人干，差不多就干起来。在中型厂房金属结构工程施工的时候，本来去一百五十人就够了，他们凭经验估计去了三百人。工具少、工作面小，两个人干了一个人的活。等到这个工程完工又没有别的活干，造成了窝工浪费。年底一算细帐，发现浪费很大，感到没有计划不行了。去年他们向别的单位学习成立了计划股，每年每季每月干多少活，心里有个大数了。但是计划仍然是由计划股几个人凭经验估计出来的，而工程任务比去年加大了。由于计划不周不全，有大计划没有小计划，时常发生劳动力、材料、设备及财务上不平衡的混乱现象，出了问题找不到人负责。这种情况一直延续到今年。大型电机厂钢骨工程开工不久，仅材料消耗计划就追加了十几次。脚手杆子原计划四千根，现在已用到八千多根；估计一个铆钉组每天铆三百八十五个钉子，实际平均达到八百多，最高铆到一千二百多个。工地调度员也不习惯按计划办事，那里缺人就往那里调，很少考虑整个计划。前年他们干活还没有质量标准和操作规程，也没有检查制度，因而大大小小的质量事故不断发生。去年下半年，他们摸索着编制了一些操作规程，成立了检查组，避免了不少质量事故的发生。但是施工技术管理并没有根本的好转。今年大型电机厂工地铆焊工程一开始，还时常有号错了料，切铁板跑了线，钻错了眼，铁板拼起来两眼不合等事故发生。
    走过两年多的艰苦路程，铆焊厂的干部越来越感到“凭经验办事”和“一把抓”的办法行不通了，他们总想着用什么办法把千头万绪的事捏在一起，使它有条不紊地进行。这个问题在建立责任制度中，找到了答案。在铆焊厂大型电机厂工地建立技术质量责任制度中，他们进行了一次大规模的学习。从被揭发了的无人负责现象中，在讨论与研究质量事故的原因中，他们开始懂得了施工是有一定的规律性的，质量问题也不例外；与此相适应必须建立与健全各项工作制度，从贯彻制度中发挥组织的力量——事事有人管，人人各负专责。
    工人群众经过质量检查与讨论，懂得了“干活没有个道道，好比盲人骑瞎马”，决心按操作规程办事，还提出了许多保证。放大样的工人提出“三不放”：图纸不明不放，图纸变更甲方不签字不放，地板不平不放；号料工人提出“三不号”：原材料不平不直不号，样板样杆不经检查不号，数量规格不明不号；切断工人提出“二不切”：号不清不切，数量规格不明不切；钻眼工人提出“三不钻”：号不清不钻，样眼歪不钻，眼的规格不明不钻；拼镶工人提出“三不拼”：角钢不直不拼，铁板不平不拼，不符合图纸不拼；铆钉工人提出“三不铆”：拼不严不铆，眼不正不铆，铆钉质量不好不铆；装吊工人提出“四不装吊”：准备不好不装吊，不经检查不装吊，质量不好不装吊，信号不明不装吊。他们把工人提出的保证也订到责任制度中去。这样一来，技术管理就一环套一环地从制度上健全与固定下来了，堵塞了质量上的漏洞。铆焊厂大型工地认真贯彻责任制的结果，使铆焊工程质量达到百分之九十九点三，超过规定的质量指标。
    “百年大计，质量第一”的思想深入人心
    铆焊厂工人出身的干部和工人在一起成了习惯，办公室与现场对他们来说没有什么距离。他们不但说话在行，工人听了入耳，而且肯干。但是，两年来的事实证明，仅仅这样的关系还不能满足工人的要求。有的工人说：“队长来了好一些，他走了还是照样。”在建立责任制运动中，铆焊厂的干部体会到：要依靠群众就还得教育群众，而教育群众必须围绕中心工作来进行。大型发电厂工地在建立技术质量责任制中，除在会议上批判忽视质量的思想外，工会还利用黑板报、广播机及时报道各工序以及各小组质量情况，表扬质量好的单位和个人，同时还通过工人的实践教育工人，组织成品质量展览和形象教育，并组织工人到新建工厂参观，使“百年大计，质量第一”的思想深入人心。为了推动全面，党、工会还培养了典型小组，在工人中树立旗帜。铆钉队的王立功小组，不仅本组保证了质量，而且带动了全队工人，使铆钉质量平均达到百分之九十九点三七。在这种情况下，涌现了两个先进队和五十五个先进小组，工人创造发明不断出现。王立功创造顶钉架成功，不但节省人力，而且能保证质量。王殿文改进了风铲工具，提高工作效率三倍多。
    不断培养新的力量
    铆焊厂在建立责任制运动中，大大地向前迈进了一步，但是他们并没有自满和停止前进。周厂长说：目前铆焊工作太累太慢了，一支铆钉枪二十四斤，一天要拿上它干九小时，实在够呛！明年我们就要大量使用很轻便的电焊机，不用号料，钻眼，进度快而且坚固。今年我们正在培养四百五十多电焊工人，电焊机将由十二台增到四十九台。在加强技术力量方面，我们欢迎上级派工程师的到来，并准备今年送一批工人到速成中学、俄语专科学校、技术学校去学习。国家建设规模越大，钢骨工程就越来越多，我们要赶上国家需要！”
