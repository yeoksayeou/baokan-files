Xinhua News Agency, Changsong, Northern Korea, 11th—Six representatives elected by more than 1,400 American and British POWs in POW Camp No. 1 here told personnel of the Joint Red Cross Team on the afternoon of the 10th: “The POW camp authorities transcribed the full text of the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war on our bulletin boards and have abided by this convention.”

When the Joint Red Cross Team personnel met with the POW representatives of this POW camp, the American, British, and Canadian Red Cross personnel asked them a series of probing questions. These tanned, robust-looking POWs gave truthful accounts of the good treatment the POWs received in this POW camp.

Canadian Red Cross representative Barton asked whether the food supply and care had always been maintained like this, or whether it had only improved in recent months. British POW Davis replied, "Our life in this POW camp has been improving since we were captured."

This 33-year-old British POW often compared his 27 months in this POW camp with his four years in a German concentration camp during World War II. He said, "The accommodation here is spacious, and the food we eat is Western-style. Each of our companies has organized a club to take care of everyone's daily life, and our opinions on further improving our welfare are always accepted by the POW camp authorities."

British Red Cross representative Jeram asked, "Do you have any complaints about punishment? Is anyone currently being punished?" Soldier Savage, who lives in London, told him that currently, none of the more than 1,400 POWs are being punished. In this POW camp, the word "punishment" often refers to frank talks by the POW camp management personnel, so that the POWs can recognize their own mistakes and change their style. He also said, "Every rule that is made is for the safety of us POWs, such as prohibiting people from hitting each other, etc. The POW camp authorities are very lenient with us. Since we came here, there have been very few incidents of punishment, and all punishments have been deserved."

Young Private First Class McMillan from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, USA, said, "In our company, a doctor comes to see patients once every two days. In addition, there is a hospital on the small hill." US Army Sergeant Miller added that since they came here in 1951, everyone has been vaccinated against smallpox twice and given 18 injections, such as cholera vaccines, typhoid vaccines, and other vaccines currently used in other countries around the world.

Regarding sports, Davis told the Joint Red Cross Team personnel that because there are many sports activities, each company can receive a new ball on average every six weeks. The POW camp authorities never delay issuing them new balls. He said, "Last year, a grand POW camp-wide Olympic Games was held in Bi Tong, and our POW camp won second place. Since then, our POW camp has held three camp-wide sports meets." He also told the Red Cross Team personnel that the club held a drama competition this spring, and his company won the championship.

When Joint Red Cross Team personnel asked 27-year-old Peterson about the POWs' religious freedom, he said: "The Korean and Chinese staff in the POW camp have never interfered with our religious ceremonies, although they do not believe in any religion. They even gave us material assistance in building the altar." He also said: "I have led people in our company to hold Catholic ceremonies. On Sundays, we usually either gather to read the Bible or hold worship services, and we also have our own choir."

After hearing these facts that sufficiently proved that the POWs were being treated well, Scabro of the American Red Cross asked these POWs:
"Were you guys appointed as representatives by the POW camp authorities, or were you elected?" Peterson told him, "We were elected by secret ballot."

The POW representatives then accused American planes of bombing the POW camp twice, killing and wounding some POWs.

At the request of the other party's Red Cross Team chief representative, Jeram of the United Kingdom, the conversation ended.

    我方昌城第一号战俘营美英籍战俘选出代表
    向联合红十字会小组报告他们受到良好待遇
    【新华社朝鲜北部昌城十一日电】此间第一号战俘营一千四百多名美国籍和英国籍战俘所选出的六名代表，十日下午告诉联合红十字会小组的人员说：“战俘营当局在我们的壁报上转录了关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约的全文，并且遵守了这个公约。”
    在联合红十字会小组人员和这个战俘营的战俘代表会面时，美国、英国和加拿大红十字会人员对他们提出了一连串追根究底的问题。这些皮肤晒得很黑，样子健壮的战俘就战俘们在这个战俘营内所受到的良好待遇，作了真实的叙述。
    加拿大红十字会代表巴敦问到食物的供应和照料是一直保持这样，还是最近几个月内才好起来的，英国战俘戴维斯回答道：“自从我们被俘以后，我们在这个战俘营的生活一直在改善。”
    这个三十三岁的英国籍战俘时常把他在这个战俘营中二十七个月的情形，与他在第二次世界大战期间在一个德国集中营中四年的情形相比较。他说：“这里住所宽敞，我们吃的饭食都是西式烹调的。我们每个中队组织了一个俱乐部，来照顾大家的日常生活，我们有关进一步改善我们福利事项的意见，总是被战俘营当局所接受。”
    英国红十字会代表杰拉姆问道，“你们对于处分有没有任何怨言？现在有没有人正在受处分？”家住伦敦的士兵赛维治告诉他说，目前，在一千四百多名战俘中没有一个人正在受处分。“处分”这个字眼，在这个战俘营里往往是指战俘营管理人员的坦率的谈话，为的是使战俘能认识到他自己的错误，并改变他的作风。他又说，“所制订的每一条规则，都是为我们战俘的安全着想的，诸如禁止人们互相殴打等等。战俘营当局对我们是很宽待的。自从我们来到这里以后，很少有处分的事件，而所有的处分也都是应得的。”
    家住美国威斯康星州日内瓦湖的年青的一等兵麦克密林说，“在我们中队里，每两天便有医生来看一次病。除此之外，在小山上还有一所医院”。美军中士密勒补充道，自从他们一九五一年来到这里以后，大家种过两次牛痘，打过十八次预防针，例如霍乱预防针、伤寒预防针、以及世界上其他各国目前通用的其他预防针。
    关于运动方面，戴维斯告诉联合红十字会小组的人员说，因为体育活动很多，每一个中队平均每六星期就可以领到一个新的球。战俘营当局从来不延误发给他们新的球。他说：“去年在碧潼举行了盛大的整个战俘营的奥林匹克运动会，我们这一个战俘营赢得了亚军。自这以来，我们这个战俘营举行过三次全营范围的运动会。”他又告诉红十字会小组的人员说，俱乐部在今年春天曾经举行过一次演剧比赛，他那一个中队获得了锦标。
    当联合红十字会小组人员向二十七岁的皮特逊问到战俘们的宗教自由时，他说：“战俘营内的朝鲜和中国的工作人员从来没有干涉过我们的宗教仪式，虽然他们并不相信任何宗教。在建造祭坛时，他们还给我们物质上的援助。”他又说：“我曾领导我们那一个中队的人举行天主教仪式。在星期日，我们通常不是集合起来读圣经，就是举行礼拜，我们还有我们自己的唱诗班。”
    听到这些足以证明战俘受到良好待遇的事实以后，美国红十字会的斯卡布鲁就问这些战俘说：
    “你们这些小伙子是由战俘营当局指派充任代表的呢，还是选出来的呢？”皮特逊告诉他说：“我们是由秘密投票选出来的。”
    战俘代表们接着控诉了美国飞机曾有两次轰炸战俘营，有些战俘被炸死和炸伤。
    由于对方红十字会小组首席代表英国的杰拉姆的要求，谈话便告结束。
