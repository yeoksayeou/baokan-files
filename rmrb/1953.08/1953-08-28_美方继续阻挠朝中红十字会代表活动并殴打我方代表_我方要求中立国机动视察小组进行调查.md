Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 27th: Facts prove that the United Nations Command military authorities, disregarding the serious protests from the Korean-Chinese side and the accusations from people worldwide, continue to blatantly violate the Armistice Agreement, refuse to cooperate with the personnel of the Joint Red Cross teams, and use violent means to obstruct their provision of humanitarian services to prisoners of war.

The Korean-Chinese side recently received a report from the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives of the Koje Island sub-group of the Joint Red Cross group (South Group), informing us that although they had arrived at Koje Island at 11:00 AM on August 6th, they did not obtain permission from the United Nations Command military authorities to begin distributing gifts to the prisoners of war for the first time until 3:00 PM on August 21st. When the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives distributed gifts to a group of about 100 prisoners of war and another group of about 300 prisoners of war, the remaining approximately 200 prisoners of war welcomed the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives. The United Nations Command military authorities then used the pretext of prisoner of war demonstrations to stop the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives from distributing gifts and forced the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives to leave the area. When the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives requested to continue the distribution, nearby guards repeatedly struck Mr. Jin Shigang and Mr. Wu Qun, the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives, on the shoulders with rifle butts, twisted the latter's hands behind his back, and pushed him several steps away. Under these circumstances of violence used by the United Nations Command military authorities, the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives were forced to leave the camp. On August 27th, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, the Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, requesting the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to promptly instruct the mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team, which is currently investigating the unreasonable restrictions and obstructions by the United Nations Command military authorities on the work of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross personnel on Koje Island, to immediately investigate the above-mentioned incident and report the findings to the Military Armistice Commission for handling.

    美方继续阻挠朝中红十字会代表活动并殴打我方代表
    我方要求中立国机动视察小组进行调查
    【新华社开城二十七日电】事实证明：联合国军军事当局仍不顾朝中方面的严重抗议与全世界人民的指责，继续公然破坏停战协定拒绝与联合红十字会小组人员合作，并用暴力手段阻挠他们向战俘提供人道主义服务。
    朝中方面最近接到联合红十字会小组南组巨济岛分组朝中红十字会代表的报告，获悉他们虽于八月六日上午十一时即已抵达巨济岛，但直至八月二十一日下午三时始获得联合国军军事当局的许可，开始向战俘第一次分发馈赠品。当朝中红十字会代表将馈赠品分发给一组约一百余名与另一组约三百余战俘时，其余约二百名战俘欢迎朝中红十字会代表，联合国军军事当局即藉口战俘示威，停止朝中红十字会代表分发馈赠品，并强迫朝中红十字会代表离开该地。朝中红十字会代表要求继续分发时，附近警卫即用步枪枪柄数次打朝中红十字会代表金世刚先生和吴群先生的肩部，并将后者的双手扭置背后，将他推出数步之远。在此联合国军军事当局施用暴力的情况下，朝中红十字会代表遂被迫离开该营场。八月二十七日，军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将，根据停战协定的规定致函中立国监察委员会，要求中立国监察委员会迅速指令正在巨济岛调查联合国军军事当局对朝中红十字会人员的工作进行无理限制与阻挠的事件的机动中立国视察小组，立即对上述事件进行调查并将调查结果报告军事停战委员会处理。
