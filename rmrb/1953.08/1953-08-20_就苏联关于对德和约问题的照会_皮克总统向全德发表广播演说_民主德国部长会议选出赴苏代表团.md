    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 18th (TASS): German News Agency reported:
    President Wilhelm Pieck of the German Democratic Republic delivered a radio address to the German people on August 17, 1953, on the German Democratic Republic radio. He said:
    "Fellow countrymen in the East and West of our German homeland!
    Workers, farmers, and all citizens of the German Democratic Republic!
    German youth!
    At this time when our hearts are filled with hope and confidence, I want to speak to all the German people. For eight years, our people have been waiting for the conclusion of a just peace treaty, and have been fighting for the national unity and independence of our homeland. The peace treaty and the democratic unity of Germany are the deepest national aspirations of our people. Today, the Soviet government, in its note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States, has made proposals that make it possible to conclude a peace treaty with a democratic Germany at an early date. Therefore, the Soviet government's note is heartily welcomed by all Germans who truly love peace and have a sense of national pride, and it makes them feel reassured. This note opens the way for a peaceful solution to the German problem, thereby also easing the tense situation in Europe, which is threatened by the aggressive revival of militarism in West Germany.
    The treaties signed by Adenauer in Bonn and Paris do not conform to the national interests of our people. These treaties make it impossible for Germany to reunite, and deprive the people of West Germany of national independence for the next fifty years. The treaty links West Germany with the aggressive North Atlantic Pact, for which German youth, under the command of Hitler's generals, will have to die on the battlefield on German soil. In enslaved Germany, the war treaties guarantee the rule of the arms tycoons and Junkers, who brought our people to the brink of destruction in two world wars. Precisely because of this, the majority of the German people, men and women with the most diverse political beliefs and worldviews, oppose these war treaties and oppose Adenauer. The opposition votes Adenauer will get in this Bundestag election will also prove this point.
    The Soviet government's note opens a new stage in our people's struggle for unity and peace. The note suggests convening a peace conference within six months to discuss the issue of a peace treaty with Germany. At all stages of the preparation of the peace treaty, and at the peace conference, Germany must be guaranteed representation. The talks should not be conducted over the heads of the German people, but should be conducted with the representatives of the German people. A pan-German interim government will have the right to represent the people. This government will either replace the existing two governments, or it will be composed of representatives from both parts of Germany, exercising its functions in parallel with the existing two governments. But in any case, this government must have the power to take all steps to ensure the German people maintain peace and establish genuine democracy throughout Germany. An important step in this regard will be to prepare for free all-German elections, the results of which will determine the social and state structure of a democratic Germany, without foreign intervention.
    According to the Soviet government's proposal, the German people will be exempted from the heavy financial and economic obligations arising from the results of the Second World War. Reparations to the Four Powers and national postwar debts should cease to be paid from January 1, 1954. Occupation costs should be greatly reduced, to a maximum of 5 percent of the state budget, and total occupation costs should not exceed the level of 1949. The occupation costs in West Germany in 1949 were 3.9 billion West German marks, but in 1953 they have increased to 9.3 billion West German marks. The importance of the Soviet proposal is very clear from this fact alone.
    The Soviet government has re-submitted the draft peace treaty with Germany, which was previously submitted as an attachment to the note of March 10, 1952. The Western governments have so far not responded to this proposal, nor have they put forward any counter-proposals. They proposed to establish an international commission to study the conditions for holding elections, wanting to endlessly delay the conclusion of a peace treaty with a united, democratic Germany. The policy pursued by the US government and Adenauer, who carries out its will, is completely contrary to the vital interests of our people.
    The German people need a peace treaty, they need the democratic unity of Germany, and the eradication of arms tycoons, militarists and fascists. The free development of a peaceful economy on this basis, and equal trade with all countries, will guarantee our people a prosperous and happy life.
    The proposals included in the Soviet government's note are in line with these fundamental demands of the German people. But, dear compatriots, it is not enough to just welcome this note wholeheartedly. We ourselves must take all steps to facilitate the convening of the peace conference, the conclusion of the peace treaty, and the realization of Germany's democratic unity. An agreement among Germans is today the primary demand of the nation.
    Now, let the parliaments of East and West Germany fulfill their national obligations, let them subordinate all differences of opinion and worldview to the common interests of the German people! Our people hope that all men and women participating in the social life of East and West Germany have this lofty national consciousness.
    Dear compatriots: The Soviet government's note to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States opens the way for a peace conference, a peace treaty, and the democratic unity of Germany. This is the way to ease international tensions and ensure peace in Europe. Along this road, the German people will be able to join the family of peace-loving peoples as a great power equal to all nations. So, let us Germans walk this road! Let us submit to the true interests of the homeland that we all deeply understand! Let us start with the most recent and simplest thing—achieving an all-German agreement."
    Xinhua News Agency, August 19th (TASS Berlin, August 18th): The German News Agency relayed the press release issued by the Prime Minister's Office of the German Democratic Republic.
    The press release said: On August 17, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic held a special meeting on the decision of the Soviet government to invite a delegation from the government of the German Democratic Republic to Moscow.
    In his opening remarks, Prime Minister Grotewohl pointed out: This invitation is of particularly great significance to the German people's struggle to restore German unity and conclude a peace treaty with Germany. He said: All peace-loving Germans welcome with great joy and gratitude the recent invitation from the Soviet government, which will further strengthen and develop the friendship between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union.
    The press release said: The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic is aware of the great responsibility it bears to the German people, and therefore it will do everything possible to achieve the early establishment of an all-German democratic government and to hold free all-German elections. For this purpose, an agreement must be reached between representatives of East and West Germany.
    The press release also announced: At the special meeting, the Council of Ministers adopted a resolution expressing gratitude to the Soviet government for its statement of August 15 and the Soviet invitation to a delegation from the government of the German Democratic Republic to the Soviet Union, and believes that this decision by the Soviet government demonstrates the Soviet government's great trust in the democratic forces of the German people.
    The resolution said: The talks in Moscow will promote the early realization of the German people's urgent national desire to restore German unity, and bring the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany into a decisive stage. The Council of Ministers, like the Soviet government, believes that the Moscow talks will be another important stage in the further development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.
    The resolution also said: The proposals put forward by the Soviet government in its note of August 15 pointed out a practical way to solve the German problem in accordance with the national interests of the German people and the interests of the security of Germany's neighbors.
    The press release announced: The Council of Ministers authorized the delegation of the German Democratic Republic to discuss with representatives of the Soviet government all issues related to the development of relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, as well as urgent issues related to the entire German problem.

    就苏联关于对德和约问题的照会
    皮克总统向全德发表广播演说
    民主德国部长会议选出赴苏代表团
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林十八日电：德意志通讯社报道：  
     德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克于一五三年八月十七日在德意志民主共和国电台向德国人民发表广播演说。他说：
    “我们德意志祖国东部与西部的同胞们！
    德意志民主共和国的工人、农民与全体公民们！
    德国青年们！
    在我们的心中充满希望与信心的这个时候，我要向全体德国人民讲话。八年来，我们人民一直在等待缔结公正的和约，一直在为我们祖国的民族统一与独立而斗争。和约与德国的民主统一是我们人民最深切的民族愿望。今天，苏联政府在给法国、英国与美国政府的照会中已经提出了建议，使得有可能早日与一个民主的德国缔结和约。因此，苏联政府的照会受到所有真正爱好和平和有民族感的德国人的衷心欢迎，使他们感到安心。这个照会为和平解决德国问题开辟了道路，从而也缓和了受到西德侵略性的军国主义复活威胁的欧洲的紧张局势。
    阿登纳在波恩与巴黎签订的条约不符合我们人民的民族利益。这些条约使德国不可能重归统一，并剥夺了今后五十年内西德人民的民族独立。条约把西德与北大西洋侵略公约连在一起，为此，德国青年将在希特勒将领的指挥下，不得不在德国土地上死于战场。在被奴役的德国，战争条约保证了军火大王与容克地主这些曾在两次世界大战中把我国人民带到了毁灭的边缘的人的统治。就是因为这样，大多数德国人民，具有最不同的政治信仰与世界观的男男女女，要反对这些战争条约，反对阿登纳。这次联邦议院选举中阿登纳所将得到的反对票也将证明这一点。
    苏联政府的照会为我国人民争取统一与和平的斗争开辟了一个新的阶段。照会建议在六个月内召开和会，在会上讨论对德和约问题。在准备和约的各阶段以及在和会上，必须保证德国有代表参加。会谈应该不是超越德国人民进行，而应该是与德国人民的代表在一起进行。全德临时政府将享有代表人民的权利，这个政府或者将代替现存的两个政府，或者将由德国两部的代表组成，与现存的两个政府平行地行使职权。但是，无论如何，这个政府必须有权采取一切步骤向德国人民保证保持和平并在全德建立真正的民主。这方面的一个重要步骤将是准备全德自由选举，结果将是，在没有外国干预下，决定民主的德国的社会和国家结构的问题。
    根据苏联政府的建议，德国人民将被免除由于第二次世界大战的结果而承担的沉重的财政和经济义务。对四大国的赔款和国家战后的债务应自一九五四年一月一日起停止支付。占领费用应该大大削减，最多不得超过国家预算的百分之五，全部占领费用不得超过一九四九年的水平。西德的占领费在一九四九年为三十九亿西德马克，一九五三年已增为九十三亿西德马克，单由这一事实看来，苏联建议的重要性就是十分明显的。
    苏联政府重新提出了对德和约草案，这个草案曾附在一九五二年三月十日的照会后面提出过。西方国家政府迄今对这个建议未作任何答复，也未提出任何反建议。它们提出成立一个国际委员会来研究举行选举的条件，想要无止境地拖延与一个统一的、民主的德国缔结和约。美国政府和执行它的意志的阿登纳所执行的政策是完全违反我国人民的切身利益的。
    德国人民需要一个和约，他们需要德国的民主统一，铲除军火大王、军国主义分子和法西斯分子。在这个基础上自由发展和平经济、与各国进行平等贸易将保证我国人民过繁荣幸福的生活。
    苏联政府照会中包括的建议是符合于德国人民的这些根本要求的。但是，亲爱的同胞们，仅仅衷心欢迎这个照会是不够的。我们自己必须采取一切步骤来促成和会的召开、和约的缔结和德国民主统一的实现。德国人之间达成协议在今天是全国的主要要求。
    现在，让德国东西两部的议会履行他们的民族义务，让它们使所有的意见分歧和世界观分歧服从于德国人民的共同利益！我国人民希望参加德国东西两部社会生活的所有男男女女都有这种崇高的民族觉悟。
    亲爱的同胞们：苏联政府致法、英、美三国政府的照会为和平会议、和约与德国的民主统一开辟了道路。这是缓和国际紧张局势、保证欧洲和平的道路。顺着这条道路，德国人民将能作为与各国平等的大国，加入爱好和平人民的大家庭。所以，让我们德国人走这条道路吧！让我们服从于大家所深切了解的祖国的真正利益吧！让我们从最近和最简单的事情做起——取得全德协议。”
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社柏林十八日讯：德意志通讯社转播了德意志民主共和国总理新闻处所发表的公报。
    公报说：八月十七日，德意志民主共和国部长会议就苏联政府邀请德意志民主共和国政府代表团到莫斯科去的决定举行了特别会议。
    格罗提渥总理在致开会辞时指出：这一邀请对德国人民争取恢复德国统一及缔结对德和约的斗争有特别重大的意义。他说：全体爱好和平的德国人都非常欢欣与感激地欢迎苏联政府最近的邀请，这次邀请将使得德意志民主共和国和苏联之间的友谊进一步加强和发展。
    公报说：德意志民主共和国部长会议知道它对德国人民所负的重大责任，因此它将尽一切力量来达到早日成立一个全德民主政府和举行自由全德选举。为了这个目的，东西德代表之间必须要达成协议。
    公报并宣布：部长会议特别会议上通过决议，对苏联政府八月十五日的声明和苏联邀请德意志民主共和国政府代表团到苏联去的决定表示感激，并认为苏联政府的这个决定表明了苏联政府对于德国人民的民主力量的巨大信任。
    决议说：莫斯科的会谈将会促使德国人民要求恢复德国统一的迫切民族愿望早日得以实现，并使缔结对德和约的问题进入决定性的阶段。部长会议也和苏联政府一样，认为莫斯科会谈将成为苏联与德意志民主共和国更进一步发展友好关系的另一个重要阶段。
    决议并说：苏联政府在八月十五日的照会中所提出的建议，指出了按照德国人民的民族利益及德国邻国安全的利益来解决德国问题的实际道路。
    公报宣布：部长会议授权德意志民主共和国代表团与苏联政府代表讨论一切有关发展德意志民主共和国与苏联的关系的问题以及有关整个德国问题的紧急问题。
