Implement the Electoral Law and Carry Out the General Election

New Atmosphere in Chenliang Township, Guizhu County, After the General Election

Xinhua News Agency: Chenliang Township, Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, has further strengthened the unity among all ethnic groups and promoted agricultural production after the general election campaign.

In Xiaozhai Village, Chenliang Township, the 32 Bouyei households and 12 Miao households were disunited and had long-standing estrangement before liberation. After the general election, the unity between the Bouyei and Miao people was further strengthened. In the past, the two ethnic groups were unwilling to produce together, but now they are fertilizing and weeding together in the fields, and mutual aid activities have increased. Mutual aid groups composed of both ethnic groups have also emerged. Miao farmer Yuan Changchun lacked labor, and Bouyei neighbors, in order to jointly realize the township's call to increase production by 10%, prioritized helping him with the second weeding. Mutual aid groups from both ethnic groups often send members to attend meetings to exchange agricultural production experience and improve production technology. The Miao farmers also used the gaps in production to teach the Bouyei farmers how to fish, helping them increase their sideline income.

In promoting agricultural production throughout the township, the people's representatives implemented the resolutions of the People's Congress, went deep into the villages to mobilize the masses, and played a significant role in timely weeding and fertilizing. By the end of July, the township had completed the weeding and fertilizing work ten days ahead of schedule. Currently, the rice in the township is growing well, and some has already flowered and ripened.

Yan'an's Pilot General Election Townships Elect Township People's Representatives

Xinhua News Agency: In late July, the three pilot general election townships of Lijiaqu, Yaodian, and Jiazhuang in Yan'an County, Shaanxi Province, held election meetings and elected representatives to the Township People's Congress.

The general election campaign in these three pilot townships reflects the further consolidation and improvement of the democratic life of the old revolutionary base area people. In the forty-three electoral districts, all four thousand eight hundred and fifty-two citizens over the age of eighteen, except for eight individuals who were deprived of political rights according to the law, obtained the right to vote and stand for election. Among them, seven members of the landlord class, due to their active participation in labor and obedience to government decrees over the years, were carefully reviewed and legally changed their class status, granting them the right to vote and stand for election.

The voters in these three pilot general election townships attached great importance to their democratic rights. Before the election meetings, they conducted serious deliberation and discussion on the candidates, selecting the people they were most satisfied with as candidates. The voters in Zhaojiabian Village even automatically cleaned the courtyard, repaired the roads, and decorated the venue for the election meeting. When the election meetings were held in each electoral district, the voters participated more enthusiastically than in any other meeting. In the forty-three electoral districts, the number of voters who participated in the election accounted for 97.8% of the total number of voters in these electoral districts. A total of seventy-five representatives to the Township People's Congress were elected in each electoral district. Among them, fifty-two were representatives from the previous People's Representative Conference, accounting for 69.3% of all elected representatives. Among these representatives, seventeen had undergone the trials of the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Third Revolutionary Civil War, and had been completely trusted by the people for more than ten years. In addition, women elected as people's representatives accounted for 22% of all people's representatives.

Tianjin's Industrial and Commercial Circles Actively Participate in the General Election Campaign

Xinhua News Agency: People in Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles are actively participating in the general election campaign. Since June, the city's industrial and commercial circles have launched the study of the Electoral Law. The Tianjin Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Tianjin Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association have held multiple report meetings and forums, inviting the heads of the Municipal Election Committee to give reports and hold discussions. The "Common Program" study classes organized by the industrial and commercial circles in each district also focused on the Electoral Law, using methods such as listening to reports, small group discussions, and discussions. After the city's general election publicity work was launched, the industrial and commercial federations in each district successively convened more than two report meetings, with a total of more than 30,000 participants. Some districts also combined the specific circumstances of production and operation in the industrial and commercial circles in their districts and put forward the call to greet the general election with good production and operation.

After the study, many people in the industrial and commercial circles understood the basic spirit of the Electoral Law and the superiority of the people's democratic system, and further realized the status and responsibility of the industrial and commercial circles in the people's democratic united front, and thus actively participated in the general election campaign. Some people in the industrial and commercial circles in the Fifth District actively assisted the general election working group in conducting population surveys and voter registration. Many people in the industrial and commercial circles in the Third District actively conducted general election propaganda to their families. During the population survey and voter registration, some industrial and commercial households also carefully checked the ages of the whole family and wrote a draft list before registering. Some industrial and commercial households have already begun to greet the general election with the practical actions of striving for production and operation.

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    贵筑县陈亮乡普选后的新气象
    贵州省贵筑县陈亮乡经过普选运动后，进一步加强了各民族间的团结，并推动了农业生产。
    陈亮乡小寨村的三十二户布依族和十二户苗族农民，在解放前互不团结，长久存在着隔阂。经过普选后，布依族和苗族间的团结进一步加强了。过去不愿在一块生产的两族农民，现在同在田间施肥、薅秧，换工互助的活动多起来了。两族农民共同组成的互助组也已经出现。苗族老农民袁长春缺乏劳动力，布依族邻居为了共同实现全乡增产一成的号召，优先帮助他薅了二道秧。两族的互助组都经常互派组员参加开会，交流农业生产经验、提高生产技术。苗族农民还利用生产间隙教会布依族农民捕鱼，帮助他们增加了副业收入。
    在推动全乡农业生产中，人民代表们贯彻人民代表大会决议，深入各村发动群众，及时薅秧、施肥，起了很大作用。到七月底，全乡提前十天完成薅秧、施肥工作。现在，全乡水稻生长良好，有的已经扬花吐穗了。    （新华社）
    延安普选试办乡选出乡人民代表
    陕西省延安县李家渠、姚店、贾庄三个基层选举试办乡，已在七月下旬分别召开选举大会，选出了各乡人民代表大会的代表。
    这三个基层选举试办乡的普选运动反映了老区人民民主生活的进一步巩固和提高。在四十三个选区中，除了八个依法被剥夺政治权利的分子外，其余十八岁以上的四千八百五十二个公民全部都获得了选举权和被选举权。其中，有七个地主阶级分子，由于多年来积极参加劳动，服从政府法令，也经过仔细审定依法改变成份，给予选举权和被选举权。
    这三个基层选举试办乡的选民们都很重视他们的民主权利。他们在选举大会召开前，都对代表候选人进行了严肃的酝酿和讨论，挑选自己最满意的人当代表候选人。赵家砭村的选民们，更自动为选举大会打扫院子、修补道路、布置会场。各选区的选举大会召开时，选民们比参加任何会议都来得踊跃。在四十三个选区中，参加选举的选民占这些选区选民总数的百分之九十七点八。各选区共选出乡人民代表大会代表七十五人。其中有上届人民代表会议的代表五十二人，占全部当选代表的百分之六十九点三。这些代表中，有经历过第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争、第三次国内革命战争等各个时期的斗争的锻炼，并受到人民完全信任的十年以上的人民代表十七人。此外，妇女当选为人民代表的占全部人民代表的百分之二十二。    （新华社）
    天津市工商界积极参加普选运动
    天津市工商界人士积极参加普选运动。从六月份以来，全市工商界就展开了选举法的学习。市各界人民代表会议协商委员会、市工商业联合会、中国民主建国会天津市分会，曾举行了多次报告会、座谈会，邀请市选举委员会负责人作报告，并举行座谈。各区工商界组成的“共同纲领”学习班，也曾以选举法为中心，采用听报告、小组漫谈、讨论等方式进行过学习。全市普选宣传工作展开后，各区工商联曾先后召集了两次以上的报告会，参加的共有三万多人。有的区还结合本区工商界生产和经营中的具体情况，提出好好生产经营迎接普选的号召。
    经过学习后，许多工商界人士了解了选举法的基本精神和人民民主制度的优越性，并进一步认识到工商界在人民民主统一战线中的地位和责任，因而积极参加普选运动。第五区有些工商界人士积极协助普选工作组进行人口调查和选民登记工作。第三区许多工商界人士积极向家属进行普选宣传。在人口调查和选民登记时，有的工商户还将全家年龄核对清楚，写好草单前去登记。部分工商户并已开始用努力生产经营的实际行动来迎接普选。（新华社）
