    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th -- The state-owned Benxi Iron and Steel Company is supplying various mechanical manufacturing plants, electrical appliance factories, and agricultural machinery plants in various regions with various types of special steel and pig iron to meet their production needs. The stainless steel produced by Benxi Iron and Steel Company is a type of steel that many other steel mills in China cannot produce. In the past, power plants were unable to repair damaged turbine blades because they lacked stainless steel. Last year, after the Special Steel Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company successfully trial-produced stainless steel with the help of Soviet experts, it created conditions for electrical appliance factories and power plants across the country to manufacture and repair turbine blades. The Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant, Nanjing Electric Power Bureau, East China Electric Power Administration, and Northeast Electric Engineering Fourth Factory, among other units, have ordered large quantities of stainless steel from the company. The Northeast Electric Engineering Fourth Factory has used stainless steel to manufacture China's first turbine. After a second power plant in a certain location in Northeast China installed new turbine blades on its generator, its power generation capacity increased by 2,000 kilowatts compared to before. Benxi Iron and Steel Company has also produced many different varieties and specifications of special steel to supply mechanical plants in various regions for manufacturing ball bearings, lead screws, axle rods, gears, spindles, and high-speed cutting lathe tools. As the need for industrial production develops, the production volume of special steel at Benxi Iron and Steel Company is constantly increasing. According to statistics, the output of special steel in 1952 increased tenfold compared to 1949.
    Benxi Iron and Steel Company also supplies a large quantity of pig iron and ordinary steel to agricultural machinery plants and farm implement factories in North China and Northeast China. Just in the Northeast region, a dozen or so farm implement factories in Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Liaodong, and Jilin provinces have manufactured tens of thousands of new-style farm implements this year, all using the best molding pig iron produced by Benxi. The pig iron produced by Benxi Iron and Steel Company for open-hearth steelmaking is also continuously supplied to steel mills in East China and Central South China.
    [Xinhua News Agency] The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's medium-sized rolling mill completed the order tasks for more than 700 units nationwide in the first half of the year. There are more than 100 specifications for these products, most of which have reached the standards stipulated by the state.
    These steels produced by the medium-sized rolling mill play a significant role in supporting the production and capital construction of various industrial sectors across the country. The large quantities of square steel, round steel, flat steel, etc., produced by the factory supply the needs of all machinery factories in the Northeast region and certain machinery factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Lanzhou, and other cities, as well as East China, Central South China, and other regions. The angle steel used for the construction of the Northwest Fifth Textile Factory and textile factories in Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang, Beijing, and other cities, as well as the steel materials used by the Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory, are also entirely or partially produced by the medium-sized rolling mill. In the first half of the year, the factory also produced light rails that can be laid for thousands of miles, and promptly supplied the iron rails for transportation in famous coal, iron, tin, and other mines in Fushun, Benxi, Xuanhua, Yangquan, Gejiu, and other places in China, as well as light rails for the forest industry in Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, and other places. Some of the steel used for capital construction by the electric power departments in Southwest and Central South China has also been supplied by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's medium-sized rolling mill. The angle steel used by China's first iron tower factory for making iron towers was also supplied by the medium-sized rolling mill with several thousand tons. The steel produced by the medium-sized rolling mill also supports China's water conservancy and shipbuilding industries. The Huai River Management Committee, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and the Pearl River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, among other units that placed orders with Anshan Iron and Steel this year, have received the steel they needed from the medium-sized rolling mill on time. Some shipyards in Shanghai and Dalian have also received a large amount of steel from the medium-sized factory for manufacturing ships. In addition, the medium-sized rolling mill has also supplied a large amount of steel for the farm implement factories in various regions. In the first half of this year, the steel supplied by the factory to the farm implement factories in various provinces and cities in Northeast China and the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, if calculated based on the manufacturing of horse-drawn double-shared plows, can manufacture more than 67,000 units.

    本溪钢铁公司大量供应特殊钢钢材和生铁
    鞍钢中型轧钢厂上半年完成七百多单位的订货
    【新华社沈阳四日电】国营本溪钢铁公司以各种特殊钢钢材和生铁供应各地机械制造厂、电器制造厂和农业机械厂的生产需要。本溪钢铁公司生产的不锈钢钢材，是我国许多钢铁厂不能生产的一种钢材。过去，发电厂因为缺少不锈钢钢材，透平机的汽轮叶损坏了也无法修理。去年，本溪钢铁公司特殊钢厂在苏联专家帮助下试制不锈钢成功后，为全国各地电器制造厂和发电厂制造和修理透平汽轮叶创造了条件。北京石景山发电厂、南京电业局、华东电业管理局和东北电工四厂等单位，都向该公司订购了大批不锈钢钢材。东北电工四厂已用不锈钢制造了我国第一部透平机。东北某地第二发电厂在发电机上装上新的汽轮叶子后，发电能力比以前增加了两千瓩。本溪钢铁公司还生产了许多不同品种和不同规格的特殊钢材，供给各地机械厂制造滚珠、丝杠、轴杠、齿轮、纺锭和高速切削用的车刀等。随着工业生产发展的需要，本溪钢铁公司特殊钢钢材的生产量正在不断增加。据统计，一九五二年特殊钢钢材的产量就比一九四九年增加了十倍。
    本溪钢铁公司还以大量的生铁和普通钢材供应了华北和东北地区的农业机械厂和农具工厂。只是东北区的黑龙江、松江、辽东、吉林等省的十几个农具工厂，今年制造成万台的新式农具，都是使用本溪生产的最好的翻砂生铁。本溪钢铁公司生产的供贝氏炉炼钢用的生铁，还不断供给华东和中南地区炼钢厂的需要。
    【新华社讯】鞍山钢铁公司中型轧钢厂上半年完成了全国七百多个单位的订货任务。这些产品的规格有一百多种，大部分都达到了国家规定的标准。
    中型轧钢厂生产的这些钢材，对支援全国各地各工业部门的生产和基本建设有很大作用。该厂生产的大批方钢、圆钢、扁钢等，供应了东北区所有的机械厂和北京、天津、兰州等市以及华东、中南等地区某些机械厂的需要。西北第五纺织厂和郑州、石家庄、北京等纺织厂建厂用的三角钢，青岛纺织机械厂用的钢料，也全部或部分是中型轧钢厂生产的。该厂上半年还生产了可以铺设数千里长的轻轨，及时地供应了我国著名的抚顺、本溪、宣化、阳泉、个旧等地煤、铁、锡等矿山运输用的铁轨和内蒙、东北等地森林工业用的轻轨。西南和中南各电业部门基本建设用的部分钢材，也得到了鞍钢中型轧钢厂的供应。我国第一个铁塔厂作铁塔用的三角钢，也由中型轧钢厂供应了数千吨。中型轧钢厂生产的钢材还支援了我国水利事业和造船工业。今年上半年向鞍钢订货的治淮委员会、黄河水利委员会和珠江水利工程局等单位，都按时从中型轧钢厂得到了他们所需要的钢材。上海、大连的某些造船厂，也从中型厂得到了制造船舶的大批钢料。此外，中型轧钢厂也大量地供应了各地农具工厂所用的钢料。今年上半年该厂供应东北各省市农具工厂和华北农业机械总厂的钢料，如果以制造马拉双铧犁计算，就可制造六万七千多部。
