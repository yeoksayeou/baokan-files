China's petroleum industry, under the leadership of the People's Government and with the assistance of Soviet experts, has greatly developed. Significant achievements have been made in both oil production and oil resource exploration.

After liberation, all oil-producing areas have added many new production wells and carried out the repair of old wells. In the Yanchang area of northern Shaanxi, by the end of 1952, the number of newly drilled production wells had increased by four and a half times compared to the time of liberation. Taking a restored old well in Laojunmiao, Northwest, as an example, it saved 1 billion yuan in well drilling costs. With the help of Soviet experts, oil extraction methods have also been improved. The adoption of new methods in the Yanchang area has increased the output of some production wells by ten times compared to the past.

Thanks to the importance attached by the People's Government and the ingenuity and creativity of the workers, many oil refineries and synthetic petroleum plants have also quickly resumed normal production. The output of various products has greatly exceeded the highest pre-war levels. In 1952, crude oil production increased by 24.49% compared to 1951, and gasoline production increased by 87.84%. It is estimated that this year's crude oil production will increase by 65.9% compared to 1951, and the increase in gasoline production will greatly exceed that of crude oil.

More oil factories and oil wells are being newly built and repaired this year. After the partial resumption of production of one oil refinery, it will be able to produce tens of thousands of tons of gasoline annually.

Large-scale exploration of petroleum deposits is currently the focus of China's petroleum industry construction. China's petroleum resource exploration teams have developed significantly in recent years and are well-equipped. At present, the number of geological teams and gravity teams has increased fivefold compared to the time of liberation, magnetic teams have increased sixfold, and seismic teams have increased sevenfold. The drilling depth completed in 1952 increased by 255% compared to 1951. It is estimated that the drilling task completed this year will increase the drilling depth by 518% compared to last year, greatly exceeding the total drilling depth from 1940 to 1949 before liberation. During drilling, new drilling records are constantly emerging in various places. A drilling team in northern Shaanxi, drilling in medium-hard strata, created a new record of safely drilling 406.9 meters in ten days, and a well in the Yumen area created a new record of advancing 138.63 meters per day. With the help of Soviet experts, China has implemented winter drilling methods, increasing equipment utilization by 30%. By the end of June this year, the vast majority of drilling teams had successfully completed their drilling tasks for the first half of the year. The results of large-scale exploration have proven that China is a country rich in petroleum deposits. This year, in addition to continuing to focus on the Northwest region as the key area for petroleum resource exploration, drilling projects have also begun in Sichuan. In addition to the famous Fushun, the state plans to vigorously drill in other areas where oil shale reserves have been initially discovered, for synthetic petroleum resources.

    我国石油工业日益壮大
    新中国的石油工业，在人民政府领导下和苏联专家的帮助下，已有了很大发展。石油生产和石油资源的勘探工作都获得了很大的成绩。
    解放后，各个产油区都增加了很多新的生产井，并进行了旧井的修复工作。陕北延长地区，到一九五二年底，新打的生产井比刚解放时增加了四倍半。西北老君庙以已经修复的一口旧井计算，即节省了打井用费十亿元。在苏联专家的帮助下，还改进了采油方法，延长地区采用了新的方法，使部分生产井的产量比过去提高了十倍。
    由于人民政府的重视和各厂职工发挥了工人阶级的智慧和创造性，使很多石油加工厂与人造石油厂也都很快恢复了正常的生产，各项产品的产量都大大超过了战前的最高水平，一九五二年原油产量比一九五一年提高了百分之二十四·四九，汽油产量提高了百分之八十七·八四，预计今年的原油产量要比一九五一年增加百分之六十五·九，汽油产量增加比例还要大大超过原油。
    今年正在新建和修复更多的石油工厂和油井，其中一个石油加工厂局部恢复生产后，即可年产汽油数万吨。
    大规模地进行石油矿藏的勘探工作，是我国目前石油工业建设的重点。我国石油资源勘探队几年来已有显著发展，并有很好的装备。目前，地质队和重力队都比刚解放时增加了五倍，磁力队增加了六倍，地震队增加了七倍。一九五二年完成的钻井深度比一九五一年提高了百分之二百五十五，预计今年完成的钻井任务比去年钻井深度要提高到百分之五百十八，大大超过解放前从一九四○年到一九四九年钻井的总深度。在钻井中，各地不断出现钻进的新纪录。陕北一钻井队在中硬地层钻进，创造了十天安全钻进四○六·九公尺和玉门区某号井创造了日进一三八·六三公尺的新纪录。在苏联专家的帮助下，我国已实行了冬季钻井的方法，使设备利用率提高了百分之三十。今年六月底绝大部分钻井队都胜利地完成了上半年的钻井任务。经过大规模勘探的结果，证明了我国是一个石油矿藏丰富的国家。今年除了继续以西北区作为石油资源的勘探重点外，并在四川开始钻井工程。人造石油资源除著名的抚顺以外，国家还计划在其它已初步发现了油田页岩储量丰富的地区进行大力钻探。
