	A City's Newspaper
	—A Review of the August 6, 1952, "Pravda"
	Editor's Note: The two "Pravda" newspaper reviews published below convey a basic idea: that newspapers should profoundly and vividly reflect the people's boiling, rich, and creatively spirited life in many aspects. These two newspaper reviews can be helpful for us in improving the content of our newspapers.

	Before us is the "Worker of the Azov Coast," a newspaper from Zhdanov, and each page is interesting to read. It reports on the inspiring, boiling, and diverse creative life in this Soviet city.

	Let's open the July 18th issue. The first page has a column titled "Complete This Year's Plan Ahead of Schedule!" This column contains the latest reports on the labor achievements of various enterprises in the city, including news of the outstanding achievements of rapid steelmaking workers in the open-hearth workshop of the Azov Steel Plant. Alongside this news is a photo of an advanced worker participating in the socialist competition, with a brief and clear explanation below:

	“The honor of the metal structure factory is inseparable from the
	youthful assembler team leader, Viktor Kuriyaninov. He perfectly
	mastered the method of quickly assembling metal structures. This Stakhanovite
	worker exceeds the production task by one and a half to two times each month.”

	Below are three short commentaries on the achievements of Stakhanovite workers. The diversity of style and theme is a feature of this newspaper. It includes columns on Party life, letters from readers, city news, Soviet domestic news, and foreign dispatches. This newspaper also publishes essays, critical communications from those participating in surprise inspections of school preparations for the academic year, an essay on the artist V.D. Polenov, and an essay written for the upcoming tour of the Gorky Russian Theater of the Dnepropetrovsk Oblast.

	This reviewed newspaper can be considered typical of this newspaper. The editorial department strives to comprehensively introduce the life of the city, especially its selfless working days. For many months, the newspaper has been explaining the competition process of various enterprises striving to shorten the production cycle issue by issue. In February of this year, the editorial department invited the two-person teams from the blast furnaces of the Azov Steel Plant to hold a meeting to exchange experiences in striving to increase the speed of metal smelting.

	"At the meeting, the blast furnace workers put forward... many valuable suggestions, and they became familiar with the work experience of foreman Comrade Moroz, ore technician Comrade Beli, and gas worker Comrade Lysenko."

	On May 11th, the newspaper talked about the achievements of the blast furnace workers' initiative.

	"Thousands of tons of pig iron produced beyond the plan, saving millions of rubles—this is the result of the blast furnace workers carrying out large-scale competition."

	Class teacher V. Sinitsky also pointed out the initiative of the editorial department in his article. He wrote:

	This meeting "helped us embark on the road of further developing technology, helping us adopt advanced methods of managing the blast furnace working process, and reducing the annual per-ton consumption rate of products."

	The newspaper's column title "Strive to Shorten the Production Cycle" is often changed to other titles, such as "Economical Use of Metal," "Maintain the Glory of the Factory's Brand," and "Better Use of Equipment." Metallurgical workers, steel rolling workers, coking workers, and construction workers are here to express their opinions and exchange experiences. In the past three months, the newspaper has published dozens of their communications and essays. For example, the famous steelworker of the Azov Steel Plant, Semyon Savelin, has written articles more than once about his experience in mastering new technologies. He and steelworker Ivan Kovalenko also proposed in the newspaper to launch a competition to shorten the production cycle.

	The life of the Party organization is also widely elaborated on in the "Worker of the Azov Coast." Almost every day, the newspaper has a Party life column. In recent times, the secretaries of some branches' Party committees have published articles on various issues: the secretary of the Party committee of the railway transportation workshop of the Azov Steel Plant wrote on the topic of Party education, the secretary of the Party committee of the fishing net manufacturing factory discussed the issue of cultivating non-Party activists, the secretary of the Party committee of the Kuibyshev factory discussed the role of Party members in striving to complete the plan, the secretary of the Party committee of the coking workshop of the chemical coking factory wrote an article on Party commissions, the secretary of the Party committee of the machinery and boiler manufacturing factory wrote on the issue of leading young Communist Party members, and the secretary of the Party committee of the railway workshop of the Kuibyshev factory wrote on the issue of how to exercise supervision over the economic work of the enterprise, etc.

	This newspaper prominently publishes feature articles on advanced figures in the city. For example, the feature article "The Best Machine Operator in the Soviet Union" talks about the story of Ilya Tereshkin, a famous operator of the blooming mill of the Azov Steel Plant: how he began his working life at the Stalin Iron and Steel Metallurgical Combine, how, attracted by mastering technology, he became a first-class operator of one of the world's largest blooming mills, and how he came to the Azov Steel Plant in the days of repairing the blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces destroyed by the German fascist bandits. When the factory built a rolling mill, he was assigned to the most responsible section—the job of operating a large blooming mill.

	In the feature article, it is mentioned that Comrade Tereshkin tenaciously improved the use of equipment:

	"Producing 180, 200, 250, 300, 340 ingots of steel in one shift—these
	are the results of his struggle to shorten the production cycle."

	And now, Ilya Tereshkin has many students:

	"He has trained highly skilled machine
	operators for metallurgical factories in Zaporozhye, Dneprodzerzhinsk, and the
	Transcaucasus."

	Next to feature articles such as "Old Smelting Technician Ilya Bely," "Steelworker Fyodor Ulyanov," "Welding Technician Nikolai Ovkarov," "Doctor G.G. Bausi," and "A Meritorious Teacher," there are also photos of Soviet patriots.

	One should not overlook the interesting column "In Our City" that appears in the newspaper every day. The newspaper's editorial department leads readers to completely different corners of the city: the artificial ice workshop of the Zhdanov Fish Products Factory, the technical office of the chemical coking factory, the mineral wool factory, the metallurgical college, the normal school, the music and art room of the metallurgical workers' cultural palace of the Azov Steel Plant, the local museum, the Michurin school in the Ilyichevsky district, the water sports field of the naval club, the Pioneer Palace, the children's technology station, the youth summer camp, as well as sports grounds and stadiums. Vivid descriptions familiarize readers with the work of fishermen, divers, weather station staff, sanatorium staff, artists...

	The editorial department likes to inquire into things, and it strives to bring the most different news of the day to the readers. When the ship "General Chernyakhovsky" returns from a long voyage, the editorial department asks Deputy Captain Tretyakov to give a talk about the life of the working people of Italy. When the first inland fleet ready to sail in the Volga-Don Canal arrives from Odessa and Kherson, the newspaper publishes a moving novella about how the sailors gloriously completed complex tasks in severe storms and waves. When Mikhail Shesternen, the best excavator operator in Leningrad and winner of the Stalin Prize, arrives in Zhdanov, the editorial department, together with the All-Soviet Excavation Industry Joint Trust Administration, holds a "Stakhanov Thursday" report meeting, where Comrade Shesternen talks about how he organizes the work of his team according to the economic accounting system.

	The "Worker of the Azov Coast" pays great attention to the municipal management of the city, and it often writes articles on issues such as the repair of residences and schools, the improvement of streets and city radio facilities.

	But this newspaper also has shortcomings. It does not elaborate enough on the political and cultural work carried out among the citizens, as well as school life. Readers' reactions to dramas, films, and literary works only sparsely appear in the newspaper. This newspaper should not stop at the achievements it has already made, and it must more fully and better meet the growing demands of readers who like to be demanding.

### 一个城市的报纸——一九五二年八月六日“真理报”报刊述评

1953-08-30
第3版()
专栏：苏联报纸经验

    一个城市的报纸
    ——一九五二年八月六日“真理报”报刊述评
    编者按：下面发表的两篇苏联“真理报”报刊述评贯穿着一个基本思想，就是报纸应该从多方面来深刻地、生动活泼地反映人民沸腾的、丰富的、充满创造精神的生活。这两篇报刊述评对于我们如何改进报纸内容是有参考作用的。
    在我们面前，有一份日丹诺夫市的“亚速海滨工人报”，报的各版读来都饶有兴味。所报道的是这个苏联城市中充满创造性的鼓舞的、沸腾的、多种多样的生活。
    我们打开七月十八日的报来看看吧。第一版辟栏的标题是“提前完成本年度计划！”关于本市各企业中劳动成绩的最近报道，就在这一栏，其中一则是亚速钢铁厂平炉车间快速炼钢工人的卓越成绩的消息。同这消息并列的是参加社会主义竞赛的先进者的一张照片，其下附有简短明了的说明：
    “金属结构工厂的荣誉是和青年装配工人小组
    长维克托·库里雅尼诺夫分不开的。他完美地掌
    握了快速装配金属结构的方法。这位斯大哈诺夫
    工作者每月超额完成生产任务一倍半到两倍。”
    下面还有论斯大哈诺夫工作者成绩的三个短评。体裁和主题的多种多样性是这份报的特色。上面有党的生活栏，读者来信，本市新闻，苏联国内消息和国外电讯。在这份报上也刊登着小品文，参加突击检查各学校的学年准备工作者的批评性的通讯，关于艺术家沃·德·波列诺夫的论文，为德湼泊尔彼特罗夫斯克州高尔基俄罗斯剧院即将举行巡回演出而写的论文。
    这份被审阅的报可以作为这个报的典型。编辑部努力要全面介绍本市的生活，首先是它的忘我的劳动日。好多月以来，这个报逐期说明各企业争取缩短生产周期的竞赛过程。今年二月，编辑部邀集了亚速钢铁厂的各个鼓风炉二人小组举行会议，交流争取提高金属熔铸速度的经验。
    “会上，鼓风炉工人们提出了……很多的宝贵建议，他们熟悉了工长莫罗斯同志、熔矿技工别里同志、瓦斯工李森科同志的工作经验。”
    五月十一日，报上谈到鼓风炉工人的创举所获得的成绩。
    “生产了数千吨超计划的铣铁，节省了数百万卢布——这就是鼓风炉工人开展大规模竞赛的结果。”
    班主任沃·西尼茨基在他的文章中也指出了编辑部的那种主动精神。他写道：
    这次会议“帮助我们走上使技术获得进一步发展的道路，帮助我们采用管理鼓风炉工作过程的先进方法，降低全年产品以吨计的耗费率。”
    报上的“争取缩短生产周期”的辟栏标题常换成另外一些标题，如“节约地使用金属”、“保持本厂牌子的光荣”、“更好地利用设备”等。冶金工人、轧压钢管工人、化学炼焦工人、建筑工作者就是在这里发表意见和交流经验的。在最近三个月中，报上就刊登过他们的几十篇通讯和论文。例如，亚速钢铁厂的著名炼钢工人西明·萨别林，不止一次地写过有关他掌握新技术的经验的文章。他同炼钢工人伊凡·康瓦林科在报上也提出过为缩短生产周期而展开竞赛的建议。
    党组织的生活在“亚速海滨工人报”上也有着广泛的阐述。几乎每天报上都有党的生活栏。在最近时期，一些支部的党委书记就各种问题发表了文章：亚速钢铁厂铁路运输车间党委书记写了关于党的教育的论题，鱼网制造工厂的党委书记论述了非党积极分子的培养问题，古比雪夫工厂党委书记论述了关于在争取完成计划中党员的作用问题，化学炼焦工厂炼焦车间的党委书记写了论党的委托的文章，机械和锅炉制造工厂的党委书记写了关于领导青年共产党员的问题，古比雪夫工厂铁路车间的党委书记写了关于对企业的经济工作如何行使监督权等问题的文章。
    这个报以显著的地位登载了关于本市先进人物的特写。如，在“苏联的最好的机器操使者”一篇特写中谈到亚速钢铁厂初轧机著名操使者伊里·捷列什金的故事：他如何在斯大林锻铁冶金联合工厂开始了自己的劳动生活，他怎样在掌握技术的吸引下，变成了世界最大初轧机之一的一级操使者，在修复为德国法西斯强盗所破坏的鼓风炉和平炉的日子里，他如何来到了亚速钢铁厂。在工厂建造压延车间的时候，他被分配到责任最重大的分间中去——操使大型初轧机的工作。
    在特写里，谈到捷列什金同志顽强地改进了对设备的使用：
    “在一个班的工作时间中，生产一八○块，二○
    ○块，二五○块，三○○块，三四○块钢锭——这
    些就是他为缩短生产周期而进行斗争的成果”。
    而现在，伊里·捷列什金有了很多学生：
    “他为查坡洛什、德湼泊捷尔仁斯基、外高加
    索等地的冶金工厂，培养了高度业务水平的机器
    操使者。”
    在“熔矿炉老技工伊利亚·别利依”、“炼钢工人费道尔·乌利亚诺夫”、“焊接技工尼古拉·奥佛卡洛夫”、“医生格·格·鲍西”、“一个有功勋的教员”等特写旁，也附有苏联爱国者们的像片。
    不应当不看每天见报的“在我们的城市中”这一饶有兴味的一栏。报纸编辑部把读者引到本市完全不同的角落：日丹诺夫鱼品工厂的人造冰车间，化学炼焦工厂的技术室，矿棉工厂，冶金学院，师范学校，亚速钢铁厂冶金工人文化宫的音乐艺术室，地方博物馆，伊里契甫斯基区的米丘林学校，海军俱乐部的水上运动场，少先宫，儿童技术站，少年夏令营，以及运动场和体育场。生动的描写使读者熟识了渔夫、潜水员、气象台工作人员、疗养所工作人员、艺术家们……的工作。
    编辑部是很喜欢探问事物的，它努力把一天中最不同的新闻带给读者。“车尔尼亚科夫斯基将军”号轮船远航归来，编辑部就请副船长特列契雅柯夫同志发表有关意大利劳动人民生活的谈话。第一批准备在伏尔加河—顿河运河中行驶的内河船队由敖德萨和赫尔松开来了，于是报上刊载了一篇关于海员们如何在严重的狂风骇浪中光荣地完成复杂任务的动人的中篇小说。列宁格勒最好的掘凿机手，斯大林奖金获得者米哈依尔·谢斯吉尔宁到了日丹诺夫市，编辑部便同全苏掘凿业联合托拉斯管理局一道举办了“斯大哈诺夫星期四”报告会，会上，谢斯吉尔宁同志谈到他如何按照经济核算制来组织自己小组的工作。
    “亚速海滨工人报”很注意本市的市政管理，它常写有关住宅和学校的修理，街道和城市无线电的设备完善等问题的文章。
    但这个报也有缺点。它对于在市民中所进行的政治和文化工作，以及学校生活，阐述得很不够。读者对戏剧、影片和文艺作品的反应，也只是稀疏地出现在报上。这个报不应当停止在已得的成就上，它还得更充分和更好地来满足喜欢求全责备的读者们的增长着的要求。
