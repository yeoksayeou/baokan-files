Hunan Province's Party and government leading organs have attached great importance to drought prevention and resistance work. Since the major floods in late May, many counties in Hunan Province have begun to pay attention to drought prevention: repairing ponds and dams breached by floods, and establishing water management and usage systems. Since the end of June, rainfall throughout the province has been minimal, the climate has been dry, and drought conditions have gradually emerged. At this time, areas with more serious drought situations such as Liling and Hanshou have shifted their focus to drought resistance. Cadres have gone deep into the villages, divided into groups, and taken responsibility for organizing the masses in drought resistance and prevention. On the basis of doing a good job in ideological mobilization, they have carried out the following tasks: organizing a large number of temporary mutual aid teams to draw water, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor and water-drawing tools; launching mutual assistance and mutual relief, mobilizing households with more water to help households lacking water, and resolving water disputes; mobilizing the masses to open up water sources; using water rationally, and implementing the "one hoe to release water" system; for individual Tian Shui fields that are dehydrated and cracked and cannot be irrigated, mobilizing the masses to carry water to moisten the fields. By mid-July, drought had spread to dozens of counties, with more serious areas including: Chaling, You County, and Liling in the Xiangtan Special District, Dao County and Ningyuan in the Xiangnan Administrative Region, Wugang, Xinshao, and Shaoyang in the Shaoyang Special District, and Baojing and Guzhang in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region. In the most severely affected areas, a small number of seedlings have died. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hunan Provincial People's Government attach great importance to the current drought prevention and resistance work. In order to study how to overcome the drought, the Provincial Party Committee held a special meeting on July 16 to discuss this issue. On the 17th, members of the Provincial People's Government and members of the Provincial Consultative Committee also held a joint meeting to discuss emergency measures for drought prevention and resistance. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Government jointly issued an emergency directive on drought prevention and resistance work, calling on cadres and the masses throughout the province to overcome complacency, use their brains to find solutions, and fight against natural disasters. At the same time, Zhou Hui, Deputy Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Cheng Xingling, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, and Tan Yubao, Vice Chairman, led work teams to the Xiangnan Administrative Region, the Xiangtan Special District, and the Shaoyang Special District to carry out work. Currently, most parts of Hunan have experienced rainfall. Except for Lingling, Shaoyang, and other places where rainfall is still low and drought resistance needs to continue, cadres in other areas have immediately led farmers to inspect and repair leaks in dikes, dams, ponds, and weirs, open ditches to divert water, and draw water to irrigate ponds for drought prevention in order to ensure a bumper autumn harvest.

    湖南党政领导机关重视防旱抗旱工作
    湖南省各级党、政领导机关高度重视防旱抗旱工作。自五月底大水过后，湖南省很多县份即开始注意防旱工作：修复被洪水冲破的塘坝，建立管水用水制度。六月底以来，全省雨量极少，气候干燥，旱象逐渐发生。这时，醴陵、汉寿等旱情比较严重地区都已转入以抗旱为中心。干部深入乡村，分片分组，包干负责，组织群众抗旱防旱。他们在做好思想动员工作的基础上进行了下列工作：大量组织临时互助组车水，解决劳力与车水工具不足的困难；发动互助互济，动员有水多的户帮助缺水户，解决水利纠纷；发动群众，开辟水源；合理用水，贯彻执行一把锄头放水制度；个别天水田脱水开裂无法灌溉的，发动群众挑水润田。七月中旬，旱情遍及数十县，比较严重的地区有：湘潭专区的茶陵、攸县、醴陵，湘南行政区的道县、宁远，邵阳专区的武冈、新邵、邵阳和湘西苗族自治区的保靖、古丈等县。最严重的地区已有小部禾苗干死。中共湖南省委会和湖南省人民政府非常重视当前的防旱抗旱工作，为了研究如何战胜旱灾，省委在七月十六日专门开会谈了这个问题。十七日，省人民政府委员和省协商委员也举行联席会议，讨论了防旱抗旱的紧急措施。中共湖南省委和省人民政府并联合发布了防旱抗旱工作的紧急指示，号召全省干部和群众克服麻痹思想，开动脑筋想办法，和自然灾害作斗争。与此同时，中共湖南省委副书记周惠同志、省人民政府程星龄副主席、谭余保副主席等都分别率领工作组到湘南行政区、湘潭专区和邵阳专区进行工作。目前湖南各地大部降雨，全省除零陵、邵阳等地雨量较小需继续抗旱外，其他地区干部已立即领导农民进行检查和抢修堤、坝、塘、堰漏洞，开沟引水，车水灌塘等防旱工作，以保证秋粮丰收。
