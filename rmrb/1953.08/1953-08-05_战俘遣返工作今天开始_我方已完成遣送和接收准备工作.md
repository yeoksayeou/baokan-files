Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 4th: The repatriation of prisoners of war will begin on the 5th. The Korean-Chinese side has now completed all preparations for sending and receiving prisoners of war.

　　Since the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Korean-Chinese side has mobilized thousands of military and civilian workers and personnel from various departments to carry out preparations for construction, supplies, medical care, and other aspects. The repatriated personnel of our side will receive comfortable and attentive care from the moment they enter the reception station until they are transferred to the rear of Korea and China to live a peaceful life. When the prisoners of war on our side arrive at our reception area in Panmunjom in vehicles sent by the U.S. side, they will be greeted by a huge archway newly erected with the Korean and Chinese characters "Embrace of the Motherland". The flags of Korea and China flutter in the wind on the archway. Entering the gate of the "Embrace of the Motherland" are ten newly built reception tents and ten small tents for office use. Cars are parked at the back door of each reception tent. These cars will carry our captured personnel along a newly opened road to Kaesong towards the health screening area. In the health screening area, more than one hundred and fifty barbers are prepared to give haircuts to the returning captured personnel, and dozens of people are helping the captured personnel to take baths and change into new clothes from the motherland. Then, the sick and wounded captured personnel are sent to the internal medicine, surgery and other wards of the temporary hospital. Each ward is very clean and quiet. The beds are padded with very soft mattresses, fresh flowers are placed on the tables, and pictures of the motherland are posted on the walls. There is a small garden in the courtyard, and various slogans and charts made of pebbles. The remaining captured personnel are sent to reception stations located in the scenic Pan'ya, Tusi Pass and Gaotou Mountain. Here, there are rows of very neat and beautiful tents, stadiums, clubs, libraries, as well as countless gardens and newly built walkways. Our captured personnel, who have long been underfed and sleep-deprived in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps and have suffered serious physical and mental damage, can freely sing, entertain, and participate in sports activities here, eat the motherland's rich food, read a large number of books, newspapers, and magazines, and see the motherland's songs, dances, dramas, and movies. After the repatriation begins, the returning captured personnel will take a short rest in Kaesong, and then be transferred in batches by train to various parts of Korea and China.

　　As of the 4th, the Korean-Chinese side has also completed various preparations for sending the other side's prisoners of war. Now, the other side's prisoners of war to be repatriated in the first batch have arrived in Kaesong, waiting for repatriation. The remaining prisoners of war on the other side have already or will soon arrive in Kaesong to wait for repatriation.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 4th: The first batch of non-Korean prisoners of war and Korean prisoners of war arrived in Kaesong by train at 0:07 and 1:20 on the 4th, respectively. They will be repatriated on the 5th.

　　Some of these non-Korean prisoners of war are sick and wounded prisoners of war, while the Korean prisoners of war are all seriously ill and wounded. Some of these sick and wounded prisoners of war became ill or were newly captured from the battlefield after the last exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war; others were in serious condition during the last exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war and were not suitable for long-distance travel. Now their health has improved, and transportation conditions are also better than before, so they can be repatriated as soon as possible.

　　During the journey, the prisoners of war received proper care from the Korean-Chinese side. Doctors and nurses accompanied the train, and the sick and wounded prisoners of war were given regular check-ups and treatment along the way. The prisoners of war repeatedly expressed their gratitude for the leniency of the Korean-Chinese side. They often opened the car windows and waved to the Korean people and the soldiers of the Korean-Chinese People's Army along the way and shouted: "You have worked hard, thank you!"

　　After arriving in Kaesong, the prisoners of war were transferred to the Non-Korean Prisoner of War Reception Station and the Korean Prisoner of War Reception Station to rest, waiting for repatriation.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 4th: Our correspondent reports: The non-Korean prisoners of war who arrived here on the evening of the 3rd are currently living in the former Medical Research Institute, waiting for repatriation. This Medical Research Institute is a two-story steel-concrete building with a garden and a small stream in front.

　　This morning, when I visited them after breakfast, many prisoners of war were strolling in the garden in the bright sunshine, some were shaving or getting haircuts, preparing to be transferred in batches at Panmunjom starting on the morning of the 5th.

　　After arriving last night, these prisoners of war immediately had a good hot meal, and then someone led them to the newly prepared beds for them, each bed with a newly made quilt. They all got up early this morning, and I saw them playing cards, playing chess, or playing the guitar. U.S. Private First Class Harold Dunn, who has been a prisoner of war for more than thirty months, is showing visitors the prizes he won in the prisoner-of-war camp competition. These prizes include bracelets, brooches, an ivory cigarette holder, silk scarves, and exquisite lacquer boxes.

　　I accompanied them on the train from the Yalu River. Whenever the train stopped, the prisoners of war sang. At a station north of Sariwon, British, Turkish, and Black American prisoners of war sang loudly to the accompaniment of harmonica and guitar while the locomotive was adding coal. Prisoner Leroy Carter said, "We had a pleasant journey all the way and didn't feel tired at all."

　　As the train sped forward, the prisoners of war saw a scene of ruined homes. Sariwon is one of the largest cities in North Korea and is now a ruin. A church was bombed, leaving only a pile of broken walls, which clearly shows the crime of the U.S. Air Force's indiscriminate bombing.

　　However, the U.S. Air Force has failed. This is further proven by the following fact: within a week of the ceasefire, the prisoners of war were able to take the train to Kaesong, although the U.S. Air Force had used all its strength to attack this railway line and other railway lines for three years.

　　Although the prisoners of war are eager to reunite with their families, the U.S. prisoners of war are worried about a news item that the Pentagon is preparing to deal with returning prisoners of war in the same way it did during the last exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war. A large proportion of the sick and wounded prisoners of war last time were "not allowed to meet with reporters". News coverage was strictly restricted. Prisoners of war who refused to cooperate in fabricating "atrocity stories" were classified as "mentally unsound" and not allowed to meet with the public.

### 战俘遣返工作今天开始  我方已完成遣送和接收准备工作

    战俘遣返工作今天开始
    我方已完成遣送和接收准备工作
    【新华社开城四日电】战俘的遣返工作将要在五日开始。现在朝中方面遣送和接收战俘的准备工作已经全部完成。
    朝鲜停战协定签字后，朝中方面便动员了数以千计的军工、民工和各部门工作人员进行修建、供应、医务及其他方面的准备工作。遣返的我方被俘人员从进入接收站起，一直到他们分别被转运到朝鲜后方和中国过和平生活时止，都将受到舒适和周到的照顾。当我方被俘人员乘着美方遣送车来到板门店我方接收区时，他们迎面就会看到新竖起的写有朝文、中文“祖国怀抱”四个大字的巨大的牌楼。牌楼上的朝中国旗在迎风飘扬。进入“祖国怀抱”的大门，便是刚搭好的十个接收帐篷和十个办公用的小帐篷。每一个接收帐篷的后门都停有汽车。这些汽车将载着我方被俘人员沿新辟的一条通向开城的公路驶向卫生通过区。卫生通过区里，有一百五十多个理发员准备替归来的被俘人员理发，有数十人帮助被俘人员洗澡和给他们换上祖国的新的服装。然后，病伤被俘人员便被分别送到临时医院的内科、外科等病区去。每个病室都很清洁、安静，病床上垫的褥子非常柔软，桌上放着鲜花，墙上贴着祖国的图片。院落里都有个小小的花园，和用石子做成的各种标语和各种图表。其余的被俘人员就送到设于风景优美的盘崖、土思岘和高头山里的接收站去。在这里，有一排排的十分整齐美观的帐篷，有体育场、俱乐部、图书室，还有无数园圃和新修的甬道。长期在美方战俘营里食不饱、睡不好，肉体和精神受到严重摧残的我方被俘人员，可以在这里自由地歌唱、娱乐和进行体育活动，可以吃到祖国的丰盛的食物，可以阅读大量的书报杂志，可以看到祖国的歌舞、戏剧和电影。遣俘开始后，归来的被俘人员将在开城经过短期休息，然后分批乘火车分别转送到朝鲜各地和中国去。
    到四日止，朝中方面对遣送对方战俘的各种准备工作也已完成。现在，将予首批遣返的对方战俘已到开城，等待遣送。其余的对方战俘也已经或即将来开城等待遣送。
    【新华社开城四日电】第一批非朝鲜籍战俘和朝鲜籍战俘，已在四日零点七分和一点二十分先后乘火车到达开城。他们将在五日遣返。
    这一批非朝鲜籍战俘中有一部分是病伤战俘，朝鲜籍战俘则全是重病、重伤者。这些病伤战俘一部分是在上次交换病伤战俘以后患病或新从战场上俘获的；一部分是在上次交换伤病战俘时病情伤情严重、不适宜于长途旅行的，现在他们的健康情况已经改善，同时交通条件也较前为好。所以他们可尽先遣返了。
    在旅途中，战俘们受到朝中方面妥善的照顾。医师和护士都随车同行，沿途伤病战俘都得到定时的检查和治疗。战俘们对朝中方面的宽待一再表示感激。他们常常打开车窗，向沿途的朝鲜人民和朝中人民部队战士招手并且高声喊道：“你们辛苦了，谢谢你们！”
    战俘们到达开城后，即分别转到非朝鲜籍战俘招待站和朝鲜籍战俘招待站休息，等候遣返。
    【新华社开城四日电】本社记者报道：三日晚到达此间的非朝鲜籍战俘目前住在从前的医学研究院里，等待遣返。这个医学研究院是一座两层楼的钢骨水泥建筑物，前面有一个花园和一条小溪。
    今天早晨，当我在早餐之后去访问他们的时候，许多战俘正在灿烂的阳光下在花园里散步，有的在刮胡子或理发，准备在五日早晨开始在板门店分批被移交过去。
    这些战俘在昨晚到达之后，立刻就吃到一顿很好的热饭，然后就有人领他们到为他们新准备好的床铺边去，每张床上都有新制成的被子。今天早晨他们都起得很早，我看到他们在玩牌、下棋、或弹吉他。被俘了三十个月以上的美国上等兵哈罗德·顿恩正把他在战俘营的竞赛中得到的奖品拿给来参观的人看。这些奖品中包括手镯、饰针、一个象牙的烟嘴、丝围巾、精致的漆盒等。
    我陪同他们一起搭火车从鸭绿江边来到开城。每当火车停下来的时候，战俘们就唱起歌来。在沙里院以北的一个站头，当火车头加煤的时候，英国、土耳其和美国黑人在口琴和吉他伴奏下大声歌唱。战俘李洛埃·卡特说：“我们一路上都很愉快，并且一点也不感到累”。
    当火车疾驰前进时，战俘们看到一片一片残破的家园。沙里院是北朝鲜的最大城市之一，现在已成为一片废墟，有一个教堂被炸得只留下了一堆断垣残壁，这清楚地说明了美国空军滥肆轰炸的罪行。
    但是，美国空军是失败了，这从下面的事实得到了更有力的证明：在停火后一星期内，战俘们就能乘火车到开城，虽然美国空军在三年来曾以全力攻击这条铁路线和其他铁路线。
    虽然战俘们很渴望与他们的家人团聚，但美国战俘们对一个消息感到忧虑，这个消息说，五角大楼正准备以上次在交换病伤战俘时使用的办法对付回家的战俘们。上次的病伤战俘有一大部分是“不准接见记者”的。新闻采访受到严格的限制。拒绝合作捏造“暴行故事”的战俘被列为“头脑不健全”的人，不准他们与公众见面。
