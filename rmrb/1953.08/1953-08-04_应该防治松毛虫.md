    Pine Caterpillar Control Should Be Implemented
    Reader Lin Hu writes: The pine caterpillar infestation is currently very serious. According to preliminary understanding, it has spread to more than ninety counties in eighteen provinces. According to a survey of three special districts in Shandong Province, pine forests affected by the pest amount to more than 1.6 million mu; last year, as many as 440,000 pine trees in Shandong Province were eaten to death by the insects. Although the people's governments in some areas have organized the masses to capture and beat them, most areas have not yet paid widespread attention. Now I would like to introduce several methods for capturing and beating pine caterpillars for reference in various places:
    (1) Use a "hammer" or bamboo pole to knock the insects off the trees, and then extinguish them. Be careful not to damage the tender bark when hitting. The insects are poisonous, so do not pick them up by hand after knocking them down.
    (2) If the insects have already pupated or turned into moths, pick the cocoons and catch the moths as soon as possible. Catching moths is easiest in the morning when the dew has not dried. If the moths have already laid eggs, attention should also be paid to collecting the eggs; when collecting eggs, people should face the pine trees with their backs to the sunlight, making it easier to find the eggs on the branches.
    When capturing and beating pine caterpillars, various places should divide the areas into sections, so that the insects can be captured more cleanly. If there are many mountains and few people, it should also be done to "catch one tree, save one tree; catch one mountain, save one mountain."
    In addition, in order to prevent the state's forest resources from being harmed by pine caterpillars, in addition to actively organizing the masses to capture and beat them, I suggest that scientists quickly research and test more effective pest control methods using medicines and equipment.

### 应该防治松毛虫

    应该防治松毛虫
    读者林护来信：目前松毛虫为害很严重，据初步了解已遍及十八省九十多县。据山东省三个专区调查，有虫害的松林达一百六十余万亩；去年山东全省被虫吃枯死的松树即达四十四万余株。有些地区的人民政府虽然组织群众进行捕打；但多数地区还没有引起普遍的重视。现在我介绍几种捕打松毛虫的办法供各地参考：
    （一）用“榔头”或竹竿把树上的虫子敲下，然后加以扑灭。击打时应注意不要伤害嫩树皮。虫子有毒，敲下后不可用手捡。
    （二）如果虫子已经结茧或化蛾，应赶快摘茧、捕蛾。捕蛾在早上露水未干时最容易。如果蛾已产卵、也应注意进行采卵；采卵时人背着日光，面对松树，就容易发现松枝上的卵粒。
    各地在捕打松毛虫时应分片划段、这样可把虫子捕得更干净。如果山多人稀，也应做到“捉一株，救一株；捉一山，救一山”。
    此外，为了使国家森林资源不受松毛虫的危害，除应积极组织群众捕打外，我建议科学家们迅速研究和试验用药械等更有效的治虫办法。
