Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, Xu Zhe, held a reception in Beijing on the evening of the 15th to celebrate the 8th anniversary of Korea's Liberation Day "August 15th."

Those invited to attend included: Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government Zhu De, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Guo Moruo, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission Huang Kecheng, Deputy Director of the General Political Department Gan Siqi, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government Zhang Hanfu, as well as heads of various departments of the Central People's Government, leaders of various democratic parties, leaders of various people's organizations, and Vice Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Wu Han, totaling over 300 people.

Also invited to attend were diplomatic envoys and embassy staff from various countries stationed in China. The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, Xu Zhe, said in his speech at the reception: Due to the glorious victories of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the consistent efforts of the Korean and Chinese governments, and the continuous efforts of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue—the Korean armistice—has finally been achieved. However, the warmongers of American imperialism and the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique are still attempting to undermine the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Therefore, the Korean people must, together with all peace-loving people around the world, shatter any new challenges and conspiracies of the enemy with high vigilance and fight to the end for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Xu Zhe concluded by saying: Korea will do its utmost to restore and develop all peaceful facilities destroyed by the American armed aggression. The Korean people are confident that this undertaking will be successfully completed with the help of the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries.

Vice Chairman Zhu De then delivered a speech, saying: The heroic Korean people, under the leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung, have achieved a great victory in their just war against imperialist aggression and in defense of their national independence and freedom. This is a common victory for the Korean and Chinese people, and it is also a common victory for the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people around the world. The struggle of the Korean people is a great contribution to all mankind.

He continued: Now that the armistice has been achieved, our people will continue to work with the Korean people to persist in the struggle to ensure the thorough implementation of the armistice agreement, prevent the resurgence of aggressive war, and achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Our government and our people will do their best to assist the economic recovery of the Korean people.

Vice Chairman Zhu De concluded by wishing that the fighting friendship forged in blood by the people of Korea and China in the anti-aggression war would be further consolidated and developed, and wishing the world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union would become increasingly powerful and consolidated.

Soviet Ambassador Kuznetsov also delivered a speech at the meeting, congratulating the Korean people on the great victory they had won in the struggle against imperialist aggression and for freedom, and wishing the Korean people brilliant achievements in the cause of restoring their homeland devastated by the aggressors.

The reception was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere throughout.
