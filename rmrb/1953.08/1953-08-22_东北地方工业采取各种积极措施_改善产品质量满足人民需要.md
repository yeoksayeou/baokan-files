    Northeast Local Industries Adopt Various Active Measures
    Improve Product Quality to Meet People's Needs
    Northeast local industries have adopted measures such as investigating people's needs, strengthening ties with art and science departments, and improving technical levels to actively improve product quality.
    In the past, the serious problems existing in light industrial products in the Northeast were: few varieties, old styles, low quality, and high costs. For example, the masses criticized knitwear saying, "There are many for adults, few for middle-aged people, and none for children." The general products are all old-fashioned in style and dull in color, just those few kinds over and over again. In addition, as people's living standards and cultural levels have improved, their demands for products have become increasingly strict, and these inferior products can no longer meet their needs, resulting in a large backlog of light industrial products in the Northeast.
    In order to change this situation, the Northeast Local Industry Bureau first started to investigate people's needs. In order to understand the people's opinions on knitted and enamel products, the Local Industry Bureau and various factories dispatched personnel to form investigation teams, which went deep into large, medium, and small cities, rural areas, and ethnic minority areas to hold symposiums, conduct individual interviews, and solicit opinions from people of all walks of life and all classes. The Harbin Knitting Factory specifically held three exhibitions mainly for trade departments, art workers, and residents. Through these methods, they gained an in-depth understanding of the needs and preferences of various groups of people and improved product quality accordingly. For example, because rural women generally do not like pullover sweaters due to the inconvenience of breastfeeding, they designed an open-front "breastfeeding sweater." Athletes proposed that sports meets would be held everywhere, so they produced a large number of "August 1st" sportswear. The Heilongjiang Knitting Factory specially lengthened the fluff according to the severe cold situation in northern Manchuria, which was very popular among the masses. The Yanbian Knitting Factory also trial-produced long skirts loved by the Korean ethnic group.
    Secondly, the factories constantly organized workers to learn from fraternal factories in Guannei (areas south of Shanhaiguan Pass, i.e., central and southern China) and visit private factories for observation, which also played a certain role in improving product quality. For example, the Heilongjiang Knitting and Dyeing Factory sent more than 80 people to the Shanghai State-owned Knitting Factory to study for half a year. More than 100 people from Northeast knitting, enamel and other factories visited and studied in Shanghai and Tianjin for more than a month. The Yingkou Knitting Factory organized workers to study knitting looped socks at a private knitting factory in Beijing. These studies were very fruitful, correcting the past shortcomings such as the inability to mercerize, few patterns, and dull colors. In addition, Northeast factories also visited and studied each other.
    A more important measure is to establish a contact system with art and science departments. This method was inspired after watching the Soviet drama "Dawn Over Moscow." Under the advocacy of the Local Industry Bureau, the Shenyang Knitting Factory and the Shenyang Enamel Factory first established contact with the original Lu Xun Academy of Art and Literature, asking them to help analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the original patterns, explain the creative methods of realism, and guide and design the patterns of products, so that the product patterns increased greatly, and the content was also greatly enriched. Not only are they rich in national characteristics, but also the country's economic and cultural construction, beautiful rivers and mountains, and classical masterpieces are all expressed in the picture, changing the past vulgar patterns such as "Fu Lu Shou Samsung" and "drawing a big goldfish under the peony flower", which are very popular among the people. In order to continuously improve product quality, they also began to establish contact with scientific departments. Previously, a toothpaste was produced by a local industry that would burn through the oral skin, and production had to be stopped because the technical problem could not be solved. Now the Northeast Local Industry Bureau has sent three toothpastes with large outputs - "Changbai", "Mantanghong", and "Hongshiji" - to the Changchun Scientific Research Institute to identify their quality. In order to solve the problems of cooking and dyeing tussah silk and improve the quality of tussah silk, they are contacting experts from the Chemistry Department of Zhejiang University and the Shanghai Silk Company. The Changchun Enamel Factory also constantly asks the enamel group of the Changchun Scientific Research Institute for advice.
    In addition, they also use comparison methods to encourage factories to improve product quality. Last November, the Local Industry Bureau held an enamel, knitting, and rubber award meeting to select outstanding products. This year, it is planned to hold a pattern competition to select standard products and formulate operating procedures. At the same time, the factories often go to department stores to solicit opinions from salespeople on the products, and use the method of grading and pricing to encourage continuous improvement of product quality. The factory and the trade department jointly established an inspection team to strictly identify product quality.
    After this series of measures, Northeast local industrial products have been initially improved. In the past three months, the specifications and styles of products in various factories have generally increased by one to ten times. For example, the varieties of Harbin Knitting Factory have increased from two last year to eighty-two, among which the patterns, colors, and specifications of spring and autumn clothing can be compared with Shanghai goods. The varieties of socks in various factories have increased from 15 to 27, the colors have increased from 16 to 20, and the patterns have increased from 116 to 252, and the quality has also been significantly improved. However, these improvements are only the beginning, the cost of the products is still relatively high, the color cannot meet the needs of people of all strata, and the quality needs to be further improved. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to work hard, strengthen technical management, promote advanced experience, and continuously reduce costs to achieve the requirement of high quality and low price.

    东北地方工业采取各种积极措施
    改善产品质量满足人民需要
    东北地方工业采取了调查人民需要、加强与艺术科学部门的联系、提高技术水平等措施，积极改进产品质量。
    过去东北轻工业产品存在的严重问题是：品种少，花样老，质量低，成本高。如群众批评针织品说：“大人用的多，中人用的少，小孩用的找也找不着。”一般的产品都是式样古板，颜色不鲜，翻来翻去就是那么几样。再加人民生活水平和文化水平提高了，对产品的要求日趋严格，这种低劣的产品更加不能满足他们的需要，因而造成了东北轻工业产品大量积压的现象。
    为改变这种情况，东北地方工业局首先着手调查人民需要，为了解人民对针织、珐琅产品的意见，地方工业局和各厂抽调出的人员组成了调查组，深入大、中、小城市，乡村及少数民族地区，开座谈会，进行个别访问，征求各界、各阶层人民的意见。哈尔滨针织厂曾专门召开了以贸易部门为主、美术工作者为主、居民为主的三次展览会。通过这些方式，深入了解了各种不同群众的需要和爱好，并据此改进产品质量，如一般农村妇女因喂奶不方便，不喜套头绒衣，就设计了一种开襟的“喂奶衣”。运动员提出：各地普遍要开运动会，他们就大量生产了“八一”运动衣。黑龙江针织厂根据北满严寒情况，特把绒毛加长，颇受群众欢迎。延边针织厂还试制了朝鲜民族喜爱的长裙子。
    其次，各厂不断组织职工向关内兄弟工厂学习，并到私营工厂观摩，也对改进产品质量起了一定作用。如黑龙江针织染整厂曾派出八十余人到上海国营针织厂学习了半年。东北针织、珐琅等厂组织百余人到上海、天津参观与学习了一个多月。营口针织厂组织职工到北京私营针织厂学习了织起毛袜子。这些学习收获都很大，纠正了过去不会丝光、花样少、色泽不鲜艳等缺点。除此之外，东北各厂之间也互相进行了参观学习。
    更重要的一个措施是与艺术科学部门建立了联系制度。这个办法是在看了苏联名剧“曙光照耀着莫斯科”后得到启发的。在地方工业局的倡导下，首先有沈阳针织厂及沈阳珐琅厂和原鲁迅文艺学院建立了联系，请他们帮助分析原有花样的优缺点，讲解现实主义的创作方法，指导和设计产品的花样，这样便使得产品花样大增，内容也大为丰富，不仅富有民族色彩，而且将祖国经济、文化建设，美丽山河，古典名画等都表现在画面上，改变了过去那种“福禄寿三星”、“牡丹花下画一条大金鱼”等庸俗的花样，大受人民欢迎。为使产品质量得到不断改进，他们同科学部门也开始建立了联系，以前地方工业有一种牙膏，用了会使口腔皮被烧破，因为技术问题不能解决不得不停产。现在东北地方工业局将三种产量较大的牙膏——“长白”、“满堂红”、“红世纪”，都送请长春科学研究所鉴定了品质。为解决柞蚕丝的煮、染色等问题，以提高柞蚕丝的质量，他们正和浙江大学化学系、上海蚕丝公司专家取得联系。长春珐琅厂也不断地向长春科学研究所搪瓷组请教。
    此外，他们还用评比方法来鼓励各厂提高产品质量。去年十一月地方工业局召开了一次珐琅、针织、橡胶评奖会，选拔了优秀产品。今年准备举行
    一次花样比赛大会选拔标准产品，制订操作规程。同时，各工厂还经常去百货公司征求营业员对产品的意见，并以分等论价办法来鼓励不断提高产品质量。工厂与贸易部联合成立了检查小组，严格鉴定产品质量。
    经过这一系列的措施后，东北地方工业产品已有了初步改善。近三个月来，各厂产品规格、样式普遍增加了一倍到十倍。如哈尔滨针织厂的品种由去年的两种增加到八十二种，其中春秋衣的花纹、色样、规格都可以与上海货媲美。各厂袜子的品种已由十五种增为二十七种，颜色由十六种增加为二十种，花纹由一百十六种增加为二百五十二种，质量也显著提高。但目前这些改善还仅仅是开始，产品的成本还比较高，色泽还不能满足各阶层人民需要，质量也有待进一步改进。因此还须继续努力，加强技术管理，推广先进经验，不断降低成本，以达到价廉物美的要求。
