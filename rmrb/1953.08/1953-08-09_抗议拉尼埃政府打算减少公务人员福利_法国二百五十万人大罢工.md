Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: Paris dispatch: A nationwide strike of 2.5 million people took place in France on August 7th to protest the Laniel government's plan to use privileges to reduce the welfare benefits of civil servants and to demand higher wages.

Those participating in the strike throughout the country included staff from various government ministries, municipal agencies, and hospitals; workers from post offices, telephone and telegraph bureaus, and radio broadcasting stations; ground staff from civil aviation companies; workers from state-owned railways, coal mines, gas plants, and power plants; workers from state-owned tobacco and match factories; workers from the Paris Metro and bus services; staff from social security agencies in the Paris region; as well as sanitation workers and undertakers.

The French Police Association stated that police officers support the strike, but they are prohibited from participating in the general strike by law.

Staff from private transatlantic shipping companies also held sympathy strikes.

The general strike was preceded by the strike of Paris civil servants on the 4th. On the 5th, a nationwide general strike of postal and telecommunications workers broke out; two days later, workers and staff from government agencies, public utilities, and state-owned enterprises across the country went on general strike one after another. This general strike of civil servants on such a scale is the largest in France since 1936.

The general strike marks a major step forward in the French working class's movement to strive for unity of action. Members of the General Confederation of Labour of France, as well as workers and staff participating in the Christian Labor Confederation, the Socialist trade union "Workers' Force," and independent trade union organizations, participated in the struggle together.

On the eve of the outbreak of the general strike, French Prime Minister Joseph Laniel announced that he would use the most severe measures and requisition orders to deal with the strikers. But Laniel did not intimidate the strikers.

    抗议拉尼埃政府打算减少公务人员福利
    法国二百五十万人大罢工
    【新华社八日讯】巴黎消息：法国全国在八月七日有二百五十万人大罢工，抗议拉尼埃政府打算利用特权来减少公务人员的福利，并要求提高工资。
    各地参加罢工的，有政府各部、市政机关和医院的工作人员，邮政、电话、电报局和无线电广播台的工作人员，民用航空公司的地勤人员，国营铁路、煤矿、煤气厂、发电厂的工人，国营烟草、火柴厂工人，巴黎地下电车和公共汽车工人，巴黎区社会保险机构工作人员以及清洁工人、殡殓工人等。
    法国警察协会说：警察们支持罢工，但是因为法律的禁止，他们不能参加大罢工。
    私营的横渡大西洋轮船公司的工作人员，也举行了同情罢工。
    大罢工是以四日巴黎公务人员的罢工为先导的。五日，全国邮电工人的总罢工爆发；两天后，全国各政府机关、公用事业和国营企业的工人和职员就纷纷总罢工。法国这样规模的公务人员总罢工是一九三六年以来最大的一次。
    大罢工标志着法国工人阶级争取行动一致的运动向前跨进了一大步。法国总工会的会员以及参加天主教劳工联盟、社会党工会“工人力量”和独立工会组织的工人和职员，一起参加斗争。
    在大罢工爆发的前夕，法国政府总理约瑟夫·拉尼埃曾经宣布要用最严厉的措施，并要用征用令来对付罢工者。但是拉尼埃并没有吓住罢工者。
