The Yongding River is a large river in North China. Its upper reaches have three main tributaries: the Sanggan River, the Yang River, and the Gui River. After converging near Guanting Village in Huailai County, it flows into a 110-kilometer-long canyon, exits the canyon at Sanjiadian, flows through the Hebei Plain, joins the North Canal, and enters the Bohai Sea via the Hai River. Its upper reaches have a continental climate with significant temperature variations and low rainfall, concentrated mainly in the late summer and early autumn. The flow is usually small, insufficient during water use periods, and excessive during the flood season, causing frequent flooding in the lower reaches. From 1912 to the time of liberation, there were seven major breaches in the dikes below Lugou Bridge, each time affecting an area of 300 to 2,000 square kilometers. Losses in agricultural products alone averaged 15,000 tons annually.

The Guanting Reservoir is a key project for the fundamental management and development of the Yongding River basin and is the largest reservoir project currently built in New China in terms of capacity. Since construction began in October 1951, tens of thousands of working people, with the active assistance of Soviet experts, have worked day and night to complete the pre-flood season projects as scheduled by the end of June. The dam was raised to 35 meters, and parts of the diversion tunnel and spillway were also completed. Construction continued during the flood season, and the entire construction project is expected to be completed by the spring of next year.

After the completion of this reservoir, it can store 2.27 billion cubic meters of water, three times larger than the storage capacity of the Foziling Reservoir on the Huai River and forty-four times larger than the storage capacity of the Shimantan Reservoir. From then on, the floods above Guanting on the Yongding River will be completely controlled (another reservoir will be built below Guanting). A hydroelectric power station will be built near the reservoir, and water will also be supplied to the capital's industries and residents. It will also irrigate some farmland and aid navigation. The picture above shows a panoramic view of the three main projects of the Guanting Reservoir: the dam, the spillway, and the outlet of the diversion tunnel. (Picture attached)

The diversion tunnel is located on the west bank of the Guanting Gorge. A 44-meter-high intake tower is being built at the inlet, which will be equipped with eight high-pressure gates. The water in the reservoir will flow out through these gates through a tunnel more than 490 meters long, controlled by the intake tower.

The 45-meter-high dam has been raised to 35 meters before this year's flood season and will block the floodwaters of the Yongding River, which have brought disasters to the people for many years, making it obey people's management and no longer harm the people. This is a light railway used to transport clay, and countless workers are pushing carts to transport clay for building the dam. (Photo by An Lie)

The spillway plays an important role in the entire reservoir project. After the reservoir is completed, in case of a particularly large flood, and the diversion tunnel cannot discharge it in time, or if the gates of the intake tower malfunction and threaten the safety of the dam, the water in the reservoir can flow out through the spillway.

The construction site broadcasting station broadcasts current affairs, songs, and construction site life programs to the migrant workers every day and night. This broadcasting room broadcast 1,148 manuscripts in one month, all written by the migrant workers themselves.

As darkness falls, thousands of lights light up the hillsides and riverbanks more than ten miles away from the construction site. The sounds of people are boiling, and the machines are roaring, like a night scene of a prosperous city.

In the morning, as soon as the sun rises, tens of thousands of migrant workers, carrying tools, walk to the construction site with vigour and vitality to take over the work. (Photo by Yang Li)

The people of the whole country actively support the construction project of the Guanting Reservoir, and various machines and equipment are continuously transported from all over the country to the construction site, accelerating the progress of the entire construction project. Giant cranes and groups of migrant workers are busy on the construction site.

Bulldozer operator Zhang Haiying, formerly an excellent worker of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, participated in water conservancy projects such as diverting the Yellow River to benefit the Wei River and the Jingjiang flood diversion, and is now participating in the construction of the Guanting Reservoir. Due to his active work, he has honorably received many awards and commendations. These are the dormitories where the migrant workers participating in the construction of the Guanting Reservoir live.

The construction site is equipped with a library and fourteen mobile library stations, where workers can browse various books and newspapers they like during their breaks.

At the construction site, cultural and artistic troupes often come to perform for the migrant workers to express their appreciation.

### 官厅水库巨大的建设工程

     官厅水库巨大的建设工程
     永定河是华北的一条大河，它的上游有桑乾河、洋河和妫水河三条主要支流，在怀来县的官厅村附近汇合后，流进一百一十公里长的山峡，由三家店出峡流过河北平原，汇入北运河后经海河入渤海。它的上游属于大陆性气候，气温变化显著，降雨量很少，并且集中在夏秋之交，平时流量很小，用水时期水量不够，洪水季节水量过大，下游并泛滥成灾。自一九一二年到解放时的三十多年中，芦沟桥以下的堤防大的决口即有七次，每次受灾面积由三百多平方公里到二千多平方公里，所受损失仅农产品一项，平均每年即达一万五千吨。
    官厅水库是永定河根本治理和流域开发的重点工程，是新中国目前所建水库工程中容积最大的一个。自一九五一年十月开工以来，经过数万劳动人民日夜的努力，苏联专家的积极帮助，伏汛前的工程已在六月底如期完成，拦河坝筑高到三十五公尺，输水道和溢洪道也各完成了一部分，伏汛期间继续施工，全部建设工程明年春天即可完成。
    这个水库完成后，可以蓄水二十二亿七千万立方公尺，要比淮河上佛子岭水库的蓄水量大三倍，比石漫滩水库的蓄水量大四十四倍，从此，永定河官厅以上的洪水将得到完全的控制（官厅以下将另筑水库）。水库附近将修筑水力发电站，还要输送水流给首都的工业和居民使用，并将灌溉一部分农田和接济航运。上图是官厅水库三大主要工程——拦河坝、溢洪道和输水道出水口的全景。（附图片）
    输水道是在官厅山峡的西岸，进口处正在修筑一座四十四公尺高的进水塔，将安装八个高压闸门，水库中的水，将经过这些闸门穿过四百九十多公尺长的隧洞流出，受着进水塔的操纵。
    四十五公尺高的拦河坝今年伏汛前已筑高到三十五公尺，将拦住永定河多年来给人民带来灾难的洪水，使它听从人们的管理，不再祸害人民。这是运送粘土用的轻便铁道，无数的工人们推着斗车正在为修筑拦河坝运送粘土。    （安列摄）
    溢洪道在整个水库工程中起着重要的作用。水库修好后，万一遭遇特大洪水，而输水道排泄不及或进水塔闸门一旦发生故障威胁大坝安全时，水库里的水就可以从溢洪道里流出去。
    工地广播站，每天每夜都向民工播送时事，歌曲，工地生活等节目。这个播音室曾在一个月里，广播了一千一百四十八件稿子，都是民工自己写来的。
    天色黑下来了，在工地十多里的山坡上，河岸上，亮起了千万盏明灯，人声沸腾着，机器在轰响着，像一座繁荣都市的夜景。
    早晨，太阳刚出来，成千上万的民工们扛着工具，精神焕发地走上工地去接替工作。（扬力摄）
    全国人民都积极支援官厅水库建设工程，各种机器和器材从全国各地源源运到工地来，加速了整个建设工程的进度。巨型起重机和成群结队的民工们正在工地上忙碌着。
    推土机手张海瀛，原是黄河水利委员会的优秀工人，他曾参加过引黄济卫和荆江分洪等水利工程，现在又参加了官厅水库的建设。由于他的积极工作，他曾光荣地获得许多次的嘉奖和表扬。这是参加建设官厅水库的民工们居住的宿舍。
    工地上设有图书馆和十四个图书流动站，工人们在休息的时候，可以到这里来翻阅各种自己喜爱的书报。
    在工地上，经常有文艺工作团来为民工们作慰问演出。
