Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th: A "Pravda" correspondent in Vienna reports that the Austrian people are paying close attention to the recent Soviet notes regarding the Austrian peace treaty and the independent bearing of the costs of the occupying forces in Austria. In factories, on the streets, in subways, in shops, and elsewhere, people are engaging in enthusiastic discussions about these two notes.

The Soviet government's decision to independently bear all costs of maintaining the Soviet occupying forces in Austria, thereby reducing this expenditure from the Austrian national budget, has been welcomed by people of all strata in Austria.

The "Pravda" correspondent states that the Austrian working people welcome this peace-loving move by the Soviet Union, considering it further evidence of the Soviet Union's policy of respecting the national interests of Austria. After the announcement of the Soviet government's decision, rallies were immediately held in many Austrian factories. In numerous resolutions and letters, the workers expressed the Austrian people's heartfelt gratitude. A resolution passed by the general meeting of the Vienna Battery Factory staff pointed out that the Soviet government's recent measures demonstrated the sincere friendship of the Soviet Union towards Austria.

The "Pravda" correspondent emphasizes that the attempts by certain reactionary newspapers to denigrate the Soviet Union's recent peace-loving moves have failed. The Soviet government's notes have elicited a very good response among people of all strata.

    苏联对奥照会受到奥地利人民热烈欢迎
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”驻维也纳记者报道，奥地利人民十分注意苏联最近的关于对奥和约和自行负担驻奥占领军费用的两个照会。在工厂车间中、在街道上、在地下电车中、商店中以及其他地方，到处都有人在对这两个照会展开热烈的讨论。
    苏联政府自行负担维持苏联驻奥地利占领军的全部费用、从而减除奥地利国家预算中的这一项开支的决定，受到了奥地利各阶层人民的欢迎。
    “真理报”记者说，奥地利劳动人民欢迎苏联这个爱好和平的举动，认为这是苏联奉行尊重奥地利民族利益的政策的又一明证。在苏联政府的决定公布后，奥地利的许多工厂中立即举行了集会。工人们在许多决议和信件中表达了奥地利人民的由衷感激。维也纳蓄电池工厂工作人员大会通过的决议指出，苏联政府最近的措施证明了苏联对奥地利的真诚的友谊。
    “真理报”记者强调说，某些反动报纸千方百计地企图抹煞苏联最近的爱好和平的举动，已经遭到了失败。苏联政府的照会在各阶层人民中引起了很好的反应。
