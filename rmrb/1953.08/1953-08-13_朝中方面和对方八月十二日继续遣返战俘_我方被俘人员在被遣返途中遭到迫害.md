Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 12th: On August 12th, our side repatriated 150 non-Korean prisoners of war and 250 Korean prisoners of war to the other side, including 125 wounded and sick prisoners of war, totaling 400. The non-Korean prisoners of war included 100 American prisoners of war, 25 British prisoners of war, and 25 Turkish prisoners of war.

The other side repatriated 2,137 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side, including 337 wounded and sick personnel, and 621 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, including 21 wounded and sick personnel.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 12th: Our captured personnel, who suffered all kinds of torture in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, have added new wounds from bayonet and stone attacks during their repatriation.

On the morning of August 9th, when Korean People's Army captured personnel such as Park Rae-in, who returned from the U.S. 18th Prisoner-of-War Camp on Longcao Island, were preparing to board a car to Panmunjom, a U.S. officer ordered more than 20 U.S. soldiers and more than 10 Rhee Syngman soldiers to snatch the national flags and slogans they were holding with bayonets fixed. Park Rae-in and others firmly refused to let the enemy snatch them, and the U.S. soldiers stabbed Park Rae-in and Lee Geun-soo in the arms with bayonets. Among the personnel who returned on the 10th and 11th, Choi Ki-goe, Lee Ki-gwan, and three others were also stabbed by U.S. armed personnel during repatriation.

At the same time, the U.S. side often instructed special agents or forced ignorant children to throw stones at our captured personnel riding in trains or cars. Shin Dong-hwan, one of our captured personnel who had already returned, was directly injured in the leg by a Rhee Syngman soldier throwing a stone. On August 8th, the windows of the train car carrying Korean People's Army captured personnel Lin Chang-yun, Lee In-gyu, and others, who returned from the U.S. 14th Prisoner-of-War Camp on Geoje Island, were broken by stones on the way from Incheon to Yeongdeungpo. At that time, U.S. personnel on both sides of the railway applauded. The representatives of our captured personnel in the carriage questioned the U.S. officer accompanying the train with the stones that were thrown in. On August 9th, when Korean People's Army captured personnel Kim Eui-hwa and his companions, who returned from the U.S. 13th Prisoner-of-War Camp on Geoje Island, were taking a temporary break in a car on the highway near Panmunjom, a U.S. soldier personally directed several children to throw stones at them. After our captured personnel on the car shouted loudly, the U.S. soldier fled in fear. On August 10th, an incident even occurred in the other side's handover area in Panmunjom where disguised U.S. and Rhee Syngman special agents injured three of our captured personnel with stones.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 11th: Our correspondent reports: Before the cars carrying our captured personnel even reached our handover area today, a burst of enthusiastic cheers and slogans came from the cars, drowning out the roar of the cars climbing the hills. The returning Korean People's Army captured personnel held aloft twelve self-made portraits of Marshal Kim Il-sung, the largest of which was two and a half feet high and one foot wide. They had shed blood many times to protect the portraits of their beloved leader. On August 7th, when they departed from Geoje Island by ship, U.S. and Rhee Syngman special agents snatched these portraits and gave them portraits of Rhee Syngman and flags of the South Korean puppet regime. However, they risked being beaten by U.S. personnel with clubs, tore these things up and threw them into the sea, and snatched back the portraits of Marshal Kim Il-sung.

Many of the returning Korean People's Army captured personnel wore military uniforms made from clothes issued by the U.S. side. The Chinese People's Volunteers captured personnel all wore shorts and straw sandals they had made themselves. They threw all the clothes and shoes issued by the U.S. side into the sea on the way. After they got off the bus, they threw away the rice balls issued by the U.S. side, and some angrily threw away the broken American leather shoes they had taken off.

Today, the injuries of our returning captured personnel were very serious. A Korean People's Army captured personnel named Wu Honghuan was wounded in his left arm in 1950, but he is still wrapped in a bandage oozing fresh blood. The wound of Korean People's Army captured personnel Kim Jong-man has become rotten and maggot-infested because it has not been changed for a long time. When another Korean People's Army captured personnel, Kim Fenghua, was carried off the car by our staff, he was still in a coma, muttering incomprehensible words. His companion told reporters that he had been ill for more than two months, and today in Munsan, he was beaten by a group of U.S. soldiers for shouting slogans, causing his right leg to swell up thick and large. These captured personnel of our side, who have suffered years of torment, strongly love and miss their motherland. Jiang Zaixian, a Korean People's Army captured personnel who was so ill that he could not walk, told reporters: "Even if the enemy tortures me to death, I will still be a soldier of the motherland who will not yield."

Today, the returning captured personnel of our side, like in the past, returned with passionate and firm emotions and a solemn military posture. When they entered our handover area and saw the national flag of the motherland and our handover officers, they shouted the command "Salute" on every car. The leader first got off the car and reported to our handover officers, and then everyone clenched their fists and shouted: "We swear to do our duty to the end to defend and build the motherland!"

    朝中方面和对方八月十二日继续遣返战俘
    我方被俘人员在被遣返途中遭到迫害
    【新华社开城十二日电】八月十二日，我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百五十名，朝鲜籍战俘二百五十名，其中包括伤病战俘一百二十五名，共四百名。非朝鲜籍战俘中包括美国籍战俘一百名、英国籍战俘二十五名、土耳其籍战俘二十五名。
    对方遣送给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员两千一百三十七名，其中包括伤病人员三百三十七名，中国人民志愿军被俘人员六百二十一名，其中包括伤病人员二十一名。
    【新华社开城十二日电】在美方战俘营中受尽了折磨的我方被俘人员，在遣返途中又增加了在刺刀和石块袭击下的新伤痕。
    自龙草岛美方第十八战俘营归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员朴来仁等九日上午准备上汽车到板门店的时候，有一个美国军官竟命令二十多个美军和十多个李伪军，提着上了刺刀的枪枝，去抢夺他们手持的国旗和标语。朴来仁等坚决不让敌人抢去，美军竟用枪刺把朴来仁和李根洙二人的臂部刺伤。在十日和十一日归来的人员中，还有崔奇傀、李其关等三人在遣返途中被美方武装人员用刺刀刺伤。
    同时，美方还常常指使特务分子或强迫无知儿童向乘着火车或汽车的我方被俘人员投掷石块。已经归来的我方被俘人员申东焕就曾被一个李伪军直接用石块掷伤腿部。八日，自美方巨济岛第十四战俘营归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员林昌云、李麟奎等，在仁川至永登浦的途中，所乘火车车厢的玻璃窗被石块打破。当时铁路两旁的美方人员都拍手叫好。车厢里的我方被俘人员代表曾拿着掷进来的石块质问随车的美方军官。九日，自美方巨济岛第十三战俘营归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员金义华和他的同伴乘着汽车在板门店附近公路上暂停时，有一个美方军人亲自指挥几个小孩向他们投掷石块。车上的我方被俘人员高声喝问后，这个美方军人才胆怯逃去。十日，甚至在板门店对方交接区还曾发生化装的美李特务用石块掷伤我方被俘人员三名的事件。 【新华社开城十一日电】本社记者报道：今天载着我方被俘人员的汽车还没有开到我方交接区，就从车上传来一片激昂的欢呼声和口号声，掩盖了正在翻越山岗的汽车的轰响。归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员高举着十二幅自制的金日成元帅的画像，其中最大的一幅有二尺半高，一尺宽。他们为了保护自己敬爱的领袖的画像，曾流过许多次血。八月七日，他们从巨济岛乘船出发时，美李特务曾将这些画像抢走，发给他们李承晚的画像和南朝鲜傀儡政权的旗子。但他们冒着美方人员棍棒的殴打，将这些东西撕烂扔到海里，又将金日成元帅的画像夺了回来。
    归来的许多朝鲜人民军被俘人员穿着用美方发给的衣服改制成的军服。志愿军被俘人员都穿着短裤和自己打的草鞋。他们在路上就把美方发的衣服、鞋子都扔到大海里去了。他们下车以后，将美方发给他们的饭团扔掉，有的愤怒地把脱下的美国破皮鞋扔掉。
    今天归来的我方被俘人员伤残情形很严重。一位名叫吴洪焕的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，在一九五零年左臂负了伤，但至今还包着透出鲜血的绷带。朝鲜人民军被俘人员金钟万的伤口因为很久没有换药，已经腐烂生蛆。另一位朝鲜人民军被俘人员金风华由我方工作人员从车上抬下时，还是在昏迷状态中，嘴里喃喃地说着听不清的话。他的同伴告诉记者说：他已经生了两个多月的病，今天在汶山因为喊口号，又遭到一群美军的毒打，使他的右腿肿得又粗又大。这些长年受着痛苦折磨的我方被俘人员，强烈地热爱和怀念着自己的祖国，有一位已经病得不能走动的朝鲜人民军被俘人员姜在先对记者说：“就是敌人把我折磨死了，我也是不屈服的祖国的战士”。
    今天归来的我方被俘人员也像过去一样，是带着激昂坚决的情绪和严肃的军人姿态回来的。当他们一进到我方交接区，看到祖国国旗和我方遣接军官时，每辆车上都喊着“敬礼”的口令。领队的首先下车，向我方遣接军官报告，接着大家都握着拳头高呼：“我们誓死为保卫祖国、建设祖国尽职到底！”
