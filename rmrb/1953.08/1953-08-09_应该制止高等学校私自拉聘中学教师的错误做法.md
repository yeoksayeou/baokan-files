    The Erroneous Practice of Universities Privately Soliciting Teachers from Middle Schools Should Be Stopped

    A letter from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Education Bureau: In past summer vacations, some universities often privately solicited Beijing middle school teachers. Recently, this phenomenon has been occurring continuously. As far as we know, here are a few examples:

    (1) A certain teacher from Northwest Normal College has recently been active among Beijing middle school teachers and has already recruited Wang Xifan (Second Middle School), Xu Shouzhong (Eighth Middle School), Zhou Zhenjie (Third Girls' Middle School), and Cao Jiaqi (Twelfth Girls' Middle School), etc. The conditions for recruitment are fourfold: a salary of around 450 points; consideration for the wife's work; consideration for the children's schooling; and providing housing.

    (2) Hebei Normal College recruited Sun Meisheng, a mathematics teacher from the Thirteenth Middle School, and Zhu Jingzong, a Russian teacher.

    (3) A certain teacher from Nankai University recruited Li Buyun, a Chinese language teacher from the Thirteenth Middle School.

    The above-mentioned phenomenon of privately recruiting teachers without going through organizational procedures has already caused ideological fluctuations among some teachers in this city. We believe that if universities truly need secondary schools to provide faculty, they can ask the Central People's Government Higher Education Department and the Central People's Government Education Department to plan and allocate resources in a unified manner. However, privately recruiting teachers is wrong because it inevitably creates confusion and affects secondary education work. At the same time, it will also create a very negative impact among the masses, who mistakenly believe that "being unorganized and undisciplined can gain advantages, while being disciplined and organized leads to disadvantages."

    Now that the summer vacation has arrived, if the erroneous practice of privately recruiting teachers is not corrected in a timely manner, it is feared that it will occur on a large scale. Therefore, we hope that the Central People's Government Higher Education Department and the Central People's Government Education Department will quickly pay attention to this issue and promptly find ways to stop this bad phenomenon from happening again.

    In addition, last year, some middle schools under our bureau also mistakenly recruited primary school teachers in this city, which caused ideological fluctuations among primary school teachers. This year, our bureau is determined to stop this practice and has decided to plan the issue of primary schools providing faculty to middle schools in a unified manner.

### 应该制止高等学校私自拉聘中学教师的错误做法

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应该制止高等学校私自拉聘中学教师的错误做法
    北京市人民政府教育局来信：往年暑假常有某些高等学校私自拉聘北京市中学教师的现象，最近这种现象又不断发生。现在就我们所知，举如下数例：
    （一）西北师范学院某教员最近在北京中学教师间活动，已经拉聘过王锡藩（第二中学）、徐守中
    （第八中学）、周振杰（女子第三中学）、曹家琪
    （女子第十二中学）等人。拉聘的条件有四个：工资四百五十分左右；照顾妻子工作；照顾孩子上学；给房子住。
    （二）河北师范专科学校拉聘第十三中学数学教师孙梅生和俄文教师朱敬宗。
    （三）南开大学某教员拉聘第十三中学语文教师李步云。
    上述这种不经组织手续私自拉聘教员的现象，已经引起本市部分教员的思想波动。我们认为：如果高等学校确实需要中等学校输送师资，可请中央人民政府高等教育部及中央人民政府教育部统一筹划调配。但私自拉聘教员则是错误的。因为它必然造成混乱现象，影响中等教育工作。同时，在群众中也将造成极不良的影响，他们错误地认为：“无组织、无纪律可以占便宜，有纪律、有组织反倒吃亏。”
    现在暑假已经到了，私自拉聘教员的错误做法如不及时纠正，恐怕还将大量出现。所以我们希望中央人民政府高等教育部和中央人民政府教育部迅速注意这个问题，及时设法制止这种坏现象再发生。
    此外，去年我局所属某些中学也曾错误地在本市拉聘小学教师，以致引起小学教师的思想波动。今年我局决心制止这种做法，决定统一筹划小学向中学输送师资的问题。
