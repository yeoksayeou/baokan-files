Strengthen Propaganda Work on Issues Concerning the People's Vital Economic Life

From the current situation of the Party's propaganda work, strengthening the propaganda and explanation work on economic life issues related to the people's vital interests and the fundamental interests of national construction (i.e., the people's long-term interests) has become an urgent problem to be solved. In particular, the lack of propaganda and explanation work on economic life issues such as grain problems, price problems, supply of daily necessities, disaster relief, loan problems, and land acquisition for industrial construction is a common and serious shortcoming in propaganda work in many regions.

Caring about and solving the people's livelihood problems is one of the hallmarks that distinguish the Communist Party from other political parties. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us as early as 1934 to pay attention to caring for the people's livelihood, from land reform and labor production issues to the people's clothing, food, housing, firewood, rice, oil, and salt. The reason why Comrade Mao Zedong wanted us to pay so much attention to caring for the people's livelihood is because these issues are not minor issues but major issues in the revolution. By paying attention to solving these problems, we can truly become the organizers of the masses, and the masses will truly rally around us, accept our political calls, and fight to the end for the revolutionary cause. At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong said a meaningful sentence: "What is the real wall of iron and steel? It is the masses, the millions of people who genuinely and sincerely support the revolution. This is the real wall of iron and steel, which no force can break, absolutely unbreakable. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries." Because we followed Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction, we broke the counter-revolutionaries, we liberated all of China, and now our country is carrying out planned economic construction.

After our country was liberated, especially after entering the period of planned economic construction, the people's livelihood problems became more complex than before. In addition to general political and economic problems, local and temporary economic life problems often occur. For example, a certain area may experience floods or droughts, causing the masses to feel pessimistic and even resort to praying to gods for rain; a certain area may experience a temporary shortage of grain supply, causing panic among the masses and even leading to panic buying; a certain area may need to purchase a portion of the people's land due to economic construction needs, causing dissatisfaction and unease among the masses, and even some backward elements expressing dissatisfaction with the Party and the government. These problems, in addition to the relevant business departments needing to pay attention to and solve them, also require the Party's propaganda departments and relevant business departments to carry out necessary propaganda and explanation work. Taking disaster relief as an example, it is necessary to publicize that the Party and the People's Government are determined and have the strength to lead and help the people overcome disasters, publicize the care of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the disaster victims, the People's Government's vigorous disaster relief measures, and the People's Government's relevant policies. In publicizing policies, it is also necessary to mobilize cadres and people in disaster areas to fully use the experience in past and present disaster relief work, implement unity and mutual assistance, and engage in production for self-salvation, in order to overcome the idea of simply relying on government relief. Not only that, but this kind of propaganda should also be linked to national economic construction, using the vision of national construction to encourage the people to work hard to overcome their difficulties and support economic construction.

However, many Party propaganda departments and relevant business departments have not yet paid attention to this aspect of propaganda and explanation work, let alone formulate a practical propaganda plan or propaganda points. In this way, when grain problems, disaster relief problems, or other problems become tense, the general cadres do not know how to carry out propaganda and explanation work, do not know how to educate backward elements who express dissatisfied remarks, and do not know how to give a strong rebuttal to the rumors and sabotage of reactionary elements. As a result, problems that were originally not serious become serious, and problems that could be solved quickly become even more serious. In disaster relief, such things have happened. Originally, in order to solve the grain problem in disaster areas, the Central People's Government transferred more than 1.82 billion catties of grain from various places to the disaster areas. Together with the grain stored in the hands of local state-owned grain companies, cooperatives, and farmers in the disaster areas, it was enough to solve the grain problem of the disaster victims, but panic buying of grain still occurred in individual areas. One of the reasons for this is that the Party's leading organs and relevant business departments in these areas did not carry out in-depth and patient propaganda and explanation work among the people regarding the central government's measures on this issue and the local grain storage situation.

There are many reasons for not paying attention to carrying out propaganda work on economic life issues related to the people's vital interests. However, the most important and fundamental reason is that the Party's propaganda departments and relevant business departments have a weak mass concept, are not concerned enough about the suffering of the people, and are not concerned enough about the people's economic life problems. Under the guidance of this kind of thinking, the Party's propaganda departments believe that these are economic life issues, which should be the responsibility of the economic departments, while the Party's propaganda departments are only responsible for political propaganda. In fact, these economic problems are the biggest political problems, which are related to the country's large-scale economic construction. Are they not worthy of the Party's propaganda departments' attention and propaganda work? In the past, because the Party's propaganda departments in some areas did not pay attention to these problems, some problems developed into serious political events. This lesson should be remembered. The Party constantly educates us: "All undertakings that are beneficial to the people are undertakings that are beneficial to the Party, and every Party member must do their best to do them." "The greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people are the highest standard of truth, that is, the highest standard of all actions of our Party members." (Liu Shaoqi: "On the Party") Some economic work departments believe that these are not economic problems but political problems, which should be the responsibility of the Party and the government. In particular, a small number of staff members in commercial departments believe that they are doing business and do not need to carry out propaganda and explanation work. This precisely shows that some economic workers have an extremely serious anti-mass viewpoint, treating their work as purely technical business work and opposing it to mass work. They do not understand that socialist economic construction is a great mass movement, which must attract millions of people to participate in order to achieve victory, and commercial work is naturally no exception. In the past, because some economic workers did not pay attention to or were not good at publicizing and explaining the Party's policies in their work, their work often stood in opposition to the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "Seeing the masses without propagating, without mobilizing, without speaking, without investigating, without inquiring, without caring about their suffering, and ignoring them" is a kind of liberalism. If a Communist Party member does this, it is "forgetting that he is a Communist Party member and confusing a Communist Party member with an ordinary person." How can cadres engaged in economic work, especially Party member cadres, ignore propaganda and explanation work on issues related to the people's economic life?

Therefore, we should immediately strengthen propaganda and explanation work on economic life issues related to the people's vital interests. In order to strengthen this work, first of all, the Party committee should convene staff members of relevant business departments and the Party's propaganda departments to conduct an inspection of propaganda and explanation work on economic life issues related to the people's vital interests. Various erroneous ideas should be analyzed and criticized so that they can ideologically recognize that strengthening propaganda and explanation work on economic life issues related to the people's vital interests is related to the fundamental interests of national construction; then, on this ideological basis, discuss specific methods to strengthen this work. Secondly, in accordance with the instructions and documents promulgated by the Central Committee, carry out propaganda and explanation work in a led and planned manner. The Party Central Committee and the relevant business departments of the Central People's Government frequently issue instructions and documents or make speeches on various economic life issues of the masses. For example, regarding the disaster relief issue, the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Strengthening Grain Production Increase and Disaster Relief Work" on May 16, and promulgated the "Measures for Tax Reduction and Exemption in Disaster Areas" on May 23. The person in charge of the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government made a speech on the issue of grain transportation and disaster relief. The Party's propaganda departments should formulate propaganda plans and propaganda points in accordance with these instructions, documents, and local specific conditions, and hand them over to relevant business departments for implementation. Local Party grassroots organizations can cooperate in carrying out propaganda. Local problems should also be formulated by relevant business departments under the guidance of the local Party committee and carry out propaganda and explanation.

In order to do a good job in this propaganda work, the Party organizations of business departments that are directly connected with the masses should be responsible for carrying out propaganda and explanation work on economic life issues related to the people's vital interests within the scope of their departments' business. In places with propagandists, it is also necessary to strengthen the regular education and training of these propagandists in order to continuously improve their propaganda ability and do a good job in propaganda work related to their own business.

Carrying out propaganda work on economic life issues related to the people's vital interests is not without difficulties, and even has great difficulties. Therefore, the relevant Party organizations and propagandists responsible for propaganda must carry out their work patiently and carefully. Our Party's propaganda departments should be: not only able to carry out propaganda work under victorious conditions, but also able to carry out propaganda work under difficult conditions; not only good at calling on the masses to greet victory, but also good at calling on the masses to overcome difficulties; not only good at carrying out propaganda according to the instructions of the higher authorities, but also good at carrying out propaganda according to the local and current specific conditions; not only good at making the general masses believe that the Party's policies are completely correct and completely feasible, but also good at educating relatively backward elements to consciously accept the Party's policies. With such flexible and combative propaganda work, it provides an important guarantee for timely solving the people's vital economic life problems.

### 加强有关群众切身经济生活问题的宣传工作

    加强有关群众切身经济生活问题的宣传工作
    从目前党的宣传工作状况来看，加强有关群众切身利益和国家建设根本利益（即群众的长远利益）的经济生活问题的宣传解释工作，已成为迫切需要解决的问题。尤其是对粮食问题、物价问题、生活物资供应问题、救济灾荒问题、贷款问题、购买土地进行工业建设问题等经济生活问题缺乏宣传解释工作，是许多地区宣传工作中普遍存在的严重缺点。
    关心和解决群众的生活问题，是共产党不同于其他政党的标志之一。毛泽东同志在一九三四年就已指示我们要注意关心群众的生活问题，从土地改革、劳动生产问题，直到群众的穿衣问题、吃饭问题、住房问题、柴米油盐问题。毛泽东同志所以要我们如此地注意关心群众的生活问题，就因为这些问题并不是革命中的小问题而是大问题。注意解决了这些问题，我们就能够真正成为群众的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，接受我们的政治号召，为革命事业斗争到底。当时毛泽东同志曾说过这样一段意味深长的话，他说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”因为我们遵循了毛泽东同志的这个指示，我们打破了反革命，我们解放了全中国，现在我们的国家正在进行着有计划的经济建设。
    在我们国家获得解放之后，尤其在进入有计划的经济建设时期之后，群众的生活问题就比以前更为复杂多了，除了一般性的政治、经济问题之外，还会经常发生地方性的临时性的经济生活问题。例如某个地区可能因为发生了水旱灾荒，引起群众悲观失望的情绪，以至发生求神求雨的现象；某个地区可能因为粮食一时供应不上，引起群众的恐慌不安，甚至发生抢购现象；某个地区可能因为经济建设需要，购买群众一部分土地，引起群众的不满和不安，甚至有些落后分子发表不满党和政府的言论。这些问题，除了有关业务部门需要注意和解决之外，并需党的宣传部门和有关业务部门进行必要的宣传解释工作。以救灾问题来说，就要宣传党和人民政府有决心也有力量领导和帮助人民群众克服灾荒，宣传中央和毛主席对灾民的关怀、人民政府大力救灾的措施和人民政府的各项有关政策。在宣传政策中，并要动员灾区干部和人民群众充分运用过去和现在救灾工作中的经验，实行团结互助，生产自救，以克服单纯依靠政府救济的思想。不仅如此，这种宣传同时应当与国家经济建设联系起来，用国家建设的远景，鼓舞人民群众努力克服自己的困难，支援经济建设。
    但是目前还有许多党的宣传部门和有关业务部门，尚没有注意这方面的宣传解释工作，更谈不上为此制订出一个切合实际情况的宣传计划或宣传要点。这样，在粮食问题、救灾问题，或其他问题紧张时，就使一般干部不知道如何进行宣传解释工作，不知道如何对发表不满言论的落后分子进行教育，不知道如何对反动分子的造谣破坏给以有力的驳斥。结果会使原来不严重的问题严重起来，虽然问题严重但是很快可以解决的也变得更加严重了。在救济灾荒中就发生过这样的事情。本来中央人民政府为了解决灾区粮食问题，从各地往灾区调运粮食十八亿二千余万斤，加上灾区当地国营粮食公司、合作社和农民手中的存粮是足以解决灾民的粮食问题的，但是个别地区仍发生了抢购粮食的现象。其原因之一就在于这些地区的党的领导机关和有关业务部门，没有将中央对于这一问题的措施和当地存粮情况，深入地耐心地在人民群众中进行宣传解释工作。
    不注意进行有关群众切身利益的经济生活问题的宣传工作的原因是很多的。但是最主要最基本的原因是党的宣传部门和有关业务部门的群众观念薄弱，对人民群众的疾苦关心不够，对群众的经济生活问题关心不够。在这种思想指导之下，党的宣传部门以为这是经济生活问题，应当由经济部门负责解决，而党的宣传部门只负责政治宣传。其实，这些经济问题正是最大的政治问题，是有关国家大规模经济建设的问题，难道还不值得党的宣传部门注意，并为此进行宣传工作吗？过去就因为有些地区的党的宣传部门没有注意这些问题，因而某些问题发展成为严重的政治事件。这种教训是应当记取的。党时时教育我们：“凡对人民有利的事业，即是对党有利的事业，每个党员都必须尽力去作。”“最广大人民的最大利益，即是真理的最高标准，即是我们党员一切行动的最高标准。”（刘少奇：“论党”）有些经济工作部门却认为这不是经济问题而是政治问题，应当由党和政府负责解决。尤其是少数商业部门的工作人员认为自己是作买卖的，不需要进行宣传解释工作。这正说明了有些经济工作人员存在着极严重的反群众观点的思想作风，把自己的工作当作纯技术性的业务工作，并和群众工作对立起来，他们不懂得社会主义的经济建设就是一个伟大的群众运动，必须吸引千百万群众参加才能取得胜利，商业工作自然不能例外。过去就因为有些经济工作人员不注意或不善于在自己工作中宣传解释党的政策，因而常常使自己的工作与群众对立起来。毛泽东同志曾指示我们：“见群众不宣传，不鼓动，不演说，不调查，不询问，不关心其痛痒，漠然置之”，是一种自由主义。共产党员如果这样，就是“忘记了自己是一个共产党员，把一个共产党员混同于一个普通的老百姓”。作经济工作的干部、特别是党员干部如何能够忽视对关系群众经济生活的问题的宣传解释工作呢？
    因此，我们应当立即加强有关群众切身利益的经济生活问题的宣传解释工作。而要加强这一工作，首先就要由党委召集有关业务部门和党的宣传部门的工作人员，检查一次有关群众切身经济生活问题的宣传解释工作。对于各种错误思想要予以分析批判，使其从思想上认识到加强有关群众切身利益的经济生活问题的宣传解释工作，是有关国家建设的根本利益的问题；然后在这一思想基础上，讨论出加强这一工作的具体办法。其次按照中央所颁布的指示、文件，有领导有计划地进行宣传解释工作。党中央及中央人民政府有关业务部门经常为群众的各种经济生活问题发出指示、文件，或发表谈话。例如关于救灾问题，中央人民政府政务院曾在五月十六日发布了“关于加强增产粮食和救灾工作的指示”，五月二十三日颁布了“关于受灾地区减免税收办法”，中央人民政府粮食部负责人发表了关于运粮救灾问题的谈话等。党的宣传部门应当与有关业务部门根据这些指示、文件和当地具体情况，制订出宣传计划和宣传要点，交有关业务部门执行，地方党的基层组织可以协同进行宣传。地方性的问题，也应在当地党委指导之下，由有关业务部门制订宣传计划，进行宣传解释。
    为了作好这一宣传工作，直接与群众联系的业务部门的党的组织，应负责就本部门业务范围内有关群众切身利益的经济生活问题进行宣传解释工作。在有宣传员的地方，并要加强对这些宣传员的经常的教育训练工作，以便不断地提高其宣传能力，作好与本身业务有关的宣传工作。
    进行有关群众切身利益的经济生活问题的宣传工作，不是没有困难的，甚至有很大困难，因此负责宣传的有关党组织和宣传人员，必须耐心地仔细地进行自己的工作。我们党的宣传部门应当是：不但能够在胜利条件下进行宣传工作，而且能够在困难的条件下进行宣传工作；不但长于号召群众迎接胜利，而且长于号召群众度过困难；不但善于按照上级的指示进行宣传，而且善于根据当地当时的具体情况进行宣传；不但善于使一般群众相信党的政策的完全正确与完全可行，而且善于教育比较落后的分子自觉地接受党的政策。有了这样灵活的战斗的宣传工作，就给及时解决群众切身经济生活问题提供了重要的保证。
