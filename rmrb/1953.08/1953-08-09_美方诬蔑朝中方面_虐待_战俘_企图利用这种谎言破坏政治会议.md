Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 8th: Our special correspondent reports: It has been four days since the exchange of prisoners of war began. During these four days, despite the fact that many repatriated British and American prisoners of war have acknowledged the humane treatment they received from the Korean-Chinese side, the American propaganda machine has been churning out voluminous lies slandering the Korean-Chinese side for "abusing" prisoners of war. Encouraged by the American military authorities, American journalists, like flies drawn to filth, have been besieging the repatriated prisoners of war, attempting to extract from them myths about "atrocities."

Many American journalists admit that they have tried every means to elicit information from prisoners of war that slanders the Korean-Chinese side for "abusing" prisoners of war, although their shameful efforts have often been unsuccessful. United Press reporter William Miller revealed that American journalists asked a repatriated American prisoner of war, Chiginny, "whether he was willing to say he had been abused." Chiginny said he was not. The American journalists later "tried hard to get Chiginny to talk about possible abuse," pushing him to the point where he felt afraid. But Chiginny still said, "like most of the prisoners of war interviewed, that he was treated very well." Another example was revealed by United Press reporter Kennedy. American journalists even tried to make something out of the gray hair of repatriated American prisoner of war Colonel John Harlan, asking if his gray hair was a result of his time in the prisoner-of-war camp. But to their great disappointment, Harlan replied that his hair had started to turn gray before he was captured.

Nevertheless, the American propaganda machine is still mass-producing lies slandering the Korean-Chinese side for "abusing" prisoners of war. They also released the information that American military authorities are not allowing prisoners of war to describe the "abuse" of prisoners of war by the Korean-Chinese side. But when American journalists deliberately complained that they could not obtain so-called "atrocity" materials, the American security officers in charge of monitoring the prisoners of war admitted that they did not prohibit prisoners of war from "reporting Communist abuse."

In fact, the American military authorities are only trying to prevent prisoners of war from saying that the Korean-Chinese side treated them kindly. They not only allow American journalists to force prisoners of war to talk about so-called "atrocities," but are also making every effort to instruct and assist some of them in doing so. For example, they specially selected Thomas Harrison, a cousin of the chief U.S. negotiator at the armistice talks, Harrison, to slander the Korean-Chinese side. But more American prisoners of war are clearly unwilling to violate their conscience. For example, American Marines Francis Coners, Gasper Kennedy, and Bernard Herlingie, who were repatriated on August 6, all said that the Korean-Chinese side treated them very well. Kennedy served as a cook in the prisoner-of-war camp, said that the food in his prisoner-of-war camp was very good, and greatly praised the way the food was prepared. Even Colonel Simmel, the head of the U.S. hospital receiving the prisoners of war, admitted that the prisoners of war "did not show any signs of malnutrition."

There are now ample signs that the U.S. side's fabrication of these lies slandering the Korean-Chinese side for "abusing" prisoners of war is not only an attempt to divert the world's attention and cover up their crimes of abusing and persecuting captured personnel of the Korean-Chinese side, but also harbors an ulterior political conspiracy. Now, Clark, the commander-in-chief of the United Nations forces in the United States, is spreading rumors and slandering the Korean-Chinese side for detaining a large number of prisoners of war who have not been repatriated, although he says he "lacks absolute evidence" and admits that the repatriation figures provided by the Korean-Chinese side are "very close to the accurate materials obtained by the United States." He also said that he would raise this ridiculous slander to the Military Armistice Commission and the political conference. He is also spreading this lie in the United Nations. There are reports that the United States is also attempting to file a "complaint" with the United Nations regarding these lies slandering the Korean-Chinese side for "abusing" prisoners of war. The U.S. State Department is now using these lies to agitate in the United States and around the world, attempting to undermine the political conference. For example, the "New York Times" said that the "horror stories" coming from Korea have made it impossible to have the "mood" to negotiate at the political conference. A telegram from New York on the 7th by the United Press, the mouthpiece of the U.S. State Department, nakedly exposed the purpose of fabricating such lies. United Press said, "Many Americans today are prepared to write off the Far East political conference as a failure even before it begins. The suffering stories of the prisoners released from Korea have further strengthened this view." All of this shows that the U.S. side is attempting to use these lies to obstruct the political conference, evade their responsibility for retrieving the more than 27,000 prisoners of war forcibly detained by Syngman Rhee, and create obstacles to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the Far East issue. The world must now pay serious attention to this conspiracy of the U.S. side.

### 美方诬蔑朝中方面“虐待”战俘  企图利用这种谎言破坏政治会议

    美方诬蔑朝中方面“虐待”战俘
    企图利用这种谎言破坏政治会议
    【新华社开城八日电】本社特派记者报道：双方交换战俘到今天已经有四天了。在这四天里面，尽管有许多被遣返的英美战俘承认朝中方面给予他们人道待遇，美国的宣传机器却在盈篇累牍地捏造诬蔑朝中方面“虐待”战俘的谎话。在美国军事当局的鼓励之下，美国的新闻记者们像逐臭的苍蝇一样，围攻那些被遣返的战俘，企图从他们那里榨取关于“暴行”的神话。
    不少美国记者承认，他们想尽一切办法向战俘套取诬蔑朝中方面“虐待”战俘的消息，虽然他们这种可耻的努力常常遭到失败。合众社记者威廉米勒透露，美国记者问一个被遣返的美国战俘奇金尼，“他是否愿意说受过虐待”。奇金尼说他不愿意。美国记者们后来又“竭力要奇金尼谈论可能的虐待情况”，他们把奇金尼一直逼迫到使他感到害怕。可是奇金尼还是“像大多数被访问的战俘所说的那样，说他所受的待遇很好”。另一个例子是合众社记者肯尼迪透露的。美国记者们甚至企图从被遣返的美国战俘约翰·哈兰上校的灰白头发上做出一些文章来，他们问他的灰白头发是否是到了战俘营才有的。可是使他们大为失望的是：哈兰回答说，他在被俘前头发就开始灰白了。
    虽然如此，美国宣传机器却仍在大量制造诬蔑朝中方面“虐待”战俘的谎言。它们还放出空气说，美国军事当局不许战俘叙述朝中方面“虐待”战俘的情形。但是当美国记者们故意抱怨他们搞不到所谓“暴行”的材料时，负责监视战俘的美国保安军官就供认说，他们并没有不准战俘“报告共方虐待情况”。
    事实上，美国军事当局只是尽量防止战俘说出朝中方面宽待战俘的情形，他们不但容许美国记者们逼迫战俘谈论所谓“暴行”，而且正在竭力指使和协助他们之中有的人这样作。例如，他们特地挑选了美方停战谈判首席代表哈利逊的一个堂弟托马斯·哈利逊来对朝中方面大肆诬蔑。但是更多的美国战俘显然不愿意违背他们的良心。例如，在八月六日被遣返的美国海军陆战队士兵弗兰西斯·柯纳斯，加斯柏·肯尼第，柏纳德·贺林吉，都说朝中方面给他们的待遇很好。肯尼第在战俘营中充当炊事员，他说在他的战俘营中伙食很好，他并且大事称道制作伙食的情形。就是美方接收战俘的医院负责人西姆尔上校，也承认战俘们“都没有营养不良的情形”。
    现在已经有充分的迹象证明：美方捏造这些诬蔑朝中方面“虐待”战俘的谎言，不仅是企图转移全世界的视线，掩饰他们虐待迫害朝中被俘人员的罪行，而且还包藏着一个不可告人的政治阴谋。现在在美国的联合国军总司令克拉克，正在大肆造谣，诬蔑朝中方面还扣留有大批战俘没有遣返，虽然他说他“缺乏绝对的证据”，并且承认朝中方面提供的遣返数字和“美国所获得的确实材料很相近”。他还说，他要把这个荒唐无稽的诬蔑提到军事停战委员会和政治会议上去。他并且在联合国里散布这个谎言。有消息说，美国还企图就这些诬蔑朝中方面“虐待”战俘的谎言向联合国提出“控告”。美国国务院现在正在利用这些谎言，在美国国内和全世界进行煽动，企图破坏政治会议。例如，“纽约时报”说，从朝鲜传来的“恐怖故事”已经使人不可能有“心情”来在政治会议上进行洽商了。美国国务院的喉舌合众社在七日从纽约发出的一则电讯，赤裸裸地暴露了制造这种谎言的目的。合众社说，“很多美国人今日准备甚至在远东政治会议尚未开始之前便把它当作一个失败的会议而一笔勾销了。从朝鲜释放回来的俘虏的受苦故事使这种意见更形坚定。”这一切说明，美方企图用这种谎言来阻挠政治会议，推卸他们对于追回被李承晚强迫扣留的二万七千多名战俘应负的责任，并为和平解决朝鲜问题和远东问题制造障碍。对于美方这个阴谋，全世界现在必需加以严重的警惕和注意。
