Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 11th: According to a report in the New York "Daily Worker," C.B. Baldwin, Secretary of the National Committee of the American Progressive Party, issued a statement on the 6th, calling for an end to secret deals with Syngman Rhee and calling for the launch of a "Protect Peace" movement.

    The statement welcomed the Korean armistice, pointing out that it was "a victory for the people of the world," and that it "proves that a third world war is not inevitable."

    The statement called on Progressive Party organizations across the country to launch a "Protect Peace" movement. The statement said: Dulles' threat to withdraw from the political conference if the other side does not do as the United States says, and Syngman Rhee's "release" of prisoners of war, "have shaken the world, and this is clearly undermining the world's people's desire for peace represented by the hard-won armistice."

    The statement said: "Therefore, the Progressive Party demands an end to the secret deals between Dulles and Syngman Rhee."

    美国进步党反对杜勒斯李承晚的秘密交易
    【新华社柏林十一日电】据纽约“工人日报”报道：美国进步党全国委员会书记克·布·鲍德温于六日发表声明，要求不要和李承晚作秘密交易，并号召展开“保护和平”运动。
    声明欢迎朝鲜停战，指出这是“世界人民的胜利”，这“证明第三次世界大战不是不能避免的”。
    声明号召进步党全国各地组织发动一个“保护和平”运动。声明说：杜勒斯扬言假如另外一方不照美国说的去做就退出政治会议的威胁，以及李承晚的“释放”战俘，“已经震动世界，这显然是破坏得来非易的停战所代表的世界人民的和平愿望”。
    声明说：“因此，进步党要求结束杜勒斯和李承晚的秘密交易。”
