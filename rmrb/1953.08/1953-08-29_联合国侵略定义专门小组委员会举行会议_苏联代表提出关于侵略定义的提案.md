Xinhua News Agency, New York: The UN Ad Hoc Committee on Defining Aggression held a meeting on August 24th. This ad hoc committee was established in accordance with a resolution passed by the UN Seventh General Assembly in December of last year. According to the General Assembly's resolution, the ad hoc committee should submit a draft definition of aggression or a draft clarifying the concept of aggression to the Ninth General Assembly. The ad hoc committee is composed of representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Brazil, Bolivia, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Syria, Iran, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, and the Kuomintang elements.

At the first meeting of the ad hoc committee, the Soviet representative, P.D. Morozov, suggested expelling the Kuomintang elements and inviting representatives from the People's Republic of China to attend. However, the representative of the UN Secretariat, who presided over the opening of the meeting, ruled that the ad hoc committee had no right to consider the Soviet proposal.

Soviet representative Morozov stated in his speech at the meeting that the Soviet government consistently pursues a policy of peace and has always attached great importance to defining aggression. This is extremely important for maintaining peace and security, especially for eliminating the possibility of finding excuses for aggression. He said that in order to define the term aggression, it is extremely important to define the concept of armed attack, and the ad hoc committee should focus its attention on defining this concept.

The US representative, Makotos, spoke, continuing to oppose defining aggression.

The Soviet representative submitted a proposal on the definition of aggression to the ad hoc committee, the full text of which is as follows:

"The Ad Hoc Committee on the Definition of Aggression recommends that the General Assembly adopt the following resolution: The General Assembly, deeming it necessary to formulate criteria for determining the aggressor, hereby declares:

    苏联代表莫罗佐夫在会议上发言说，苏联政府一贯执行和平政策，一直十分重视确定侵略的定义。这对维护和平与安全，特别对消除寻找侵略藉口的可能性是十分重要的。他说，为了给侵略一词确定定义，确定武装进攻这一概念的定义是极端重要的，小组委员会应该把注意力集中在这个概念的定义上。
    美国代表马克托斯发言，继续反对确定侵略的定义。
    苏联代表向小组委员会提出了一个关于侵略定义的提案，全文如下：
