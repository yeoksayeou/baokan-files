Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 15th: On the 15th, our side repatriated 100 non-Korean prisoners of war and 300 Korean prisoners of war to the other side, a total of 400. Among the non-Korean prisoners of war were 50 American and 50 British prisoners.

The other side repatriated 2,387 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side. Yesterday, the other side informed us that all the prisoners of war repatriated today were healthy, but today it was discovered that 268 of them were injured because they were attacked by US-Syngman Rhee agents ambushing along the railway from Incheon to Munsan. In addition, according to the captured personnel who returned today, three more of our captured personnel were severely injured due to beatings by US troops and Syngman Rhee agents in Munsan and were temporarily removed from today's repatriation list by the US side.

Today, not a single captured member of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was repatriated.

    朝中方面和对方八月十五日继续遣返战俘
    我方被俘人员二百多人被美李特务殴伤
    【新华社开城十五日电】十五日，我方遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘一百名，朝鲜籍战俘三百名，共四百名。在非朝鲜籍战俘中包括美国籍五十名，英国籍五十名。
    对方遣送给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员二千三百八十七名。昨天对方通知我方今天被遣返的战俘均系健康者，但今天发现其中竟有二百六十八人负伤，因为他们在自仁川到汶山的火车上遭到了埋伏在铁路两旁的美李特务的袭击。此外，据今日归来的被俘人员说，尚有三名我方被俘人员，因在汶山遭到美军和李承晚特务的殴打，伤势严重，临时被美方从今日遣返的名单中除去。
    今天没有一名中国人民志愿军的被俘人员被遣返回来。
