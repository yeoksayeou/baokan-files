    (II) Achievements of the India-Pakistan Talks on the Kashmir Issue
    The recent series of talks between Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali in Karachi and Delhi regarding the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue and other disputes between India and Pakistan, and the subsequent joint communiqué, are of great significance for the peaceful settlement of the Kashmir issue and the promotion of normal relations between India and Pakistan. All countries and peoples who advocate the peaceful settlement of international disputes through consultation are heartened by this news.
    The Kashmir issue has been a persistent problem between India and Pakistan since their partition in 1947. For more than six years, imperialists have exploited this issue to sow discord between India and Pakistan, doing everything possible to incite discord and even armed conflict between the two countries, thereby weakening them and forcing them to seek foreign assistance. Therefore, since the partition, the borders between India and Pakistan have remained tense, and more than half of the two countries' budgets have been spent on military expenses, causing great suffering to the people of both countries.
    Under pressure from the United States, the Kashmir issue was brought to the United Nations Security Council for "resolution" in 1948. More than five years have passed since the Security Council began reviewing the Kashmir issue, but the facts have proven that not only has the Kashmir issue not been resolved, but it has been further complicated by the interference of the United States and Britain. Under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations Security Council established a committee to resolve the Kashmir issue and has long dispatched "mediators" and "United Nations representatives," namely, U.S. Navy Admiral Nimitz, to be stationed in Kashmir. According to the U.S. plan, the people of Kashmir cannot freely and unhindered express their will to resolve the issue of Kashmir's status but must accept a "plebiscite under United Nations supervision," that is, voting under the supervision of U.S. Navy Admiral Nimitz, and U.S. armed forces must be dispatched to supervise it. The United States insists that it needs to send its troops to Kashmir to promote demilitarization and implement the plebiscite. This is, of course, the unique logic of imperialist interventionists. The fact that the United Nations has been "resolving" the Kashmir issue for more than five years proves that the United States has been attempting, under the guise of the United Nations flag, to force the people of Kashmir to accept its "mediation," attempting to deceive the people of Kashmir and the governments of India and Pakistan with various suggestions, so as to eventually turn Kashmir into its colony and military base. It is this policy of U.S. interference that has hindered the resolution of the Kashmir issue between India and Pakistan.
    Recent developments in the situation in Kashmir continue to show that the U.S. aggressive forces have not abandoned their intention to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Kashmir issue and turn Kashmir into their military base. The new government of Kashmir has had to take emergency measures to stop the activities of United Nations observers, such as U.S. secret agent Major Coke, who seriously interfered in Kashmir's internal affairs, and to remove and arrest former Kashmir Prime Minister Abdullah, who was a tool of U.S. secret agents. This shows that the people of Kashmir, from their long and painful experience, have begun to recognize the conspiracy of the enemies of peace.
    The talks between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan have pointed out a clear path for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue. They understand the demands of the people of Kashmir and the people of India and Pakistan in resolving the Kashmir issue and have decided to adopt the method of direct consultation between the two countries, setting aside those foreign "mediators" and "observers." They have decided to continue to work towards an agreement on certain prerequisites for holding a plebiscite. In addition, the two Prime Ministers also reached an agreement on the exchange of enclaves between the two countries.
    During the Asia and Pacific Peace Conference last year, the Indian and Pakistani delegations attending the conference issued a joint statement on the Kashmir issue, stating: "We believe that only the entire people of Jammu and Kashmir have the right to decide their own destiny and future, and they should be guaranteed the opportunity to freely exercise this right. We call on the people of India and Pakistan to take immediate practical measures to ensure that the entire people of Jammu and Kashmir can freely decide their future destiny on an equal and just basis, without hindrance, fear, or bias." This statement has received widespread support and endorsement from the people of India, Pakistan, and Kashmir. The path to resolving the Kashmir issue pointed out by the talks between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan is consistent with the spirit of this joint statement. This shows that resolving the Kashmir issue by peaceful means and opposing the interference and obstruction of foreign aggressive forces have become a common understanding of the people and governments of India, Pakistan, and Kashmir.
    The Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan have pledged to create an atmosphere of peace and cooperation between the two countries and to avoid making statements or taking actions that would create divisions between the two countries; at the same time, they intend to maintain close contact with each other so that rapid progress can be made in resolving disputes. This friendly attitude of consultation to resolve problems is a prerequisite for the peaceful settlement of all international disputes. The Karachi and Delhi talks show that as long as both India and Pakistan have the desire for peace, take active measures to achieve an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue, and remain vigilant against the obstruction and provocation of foreign aggressive forces, then the Kashmir issue and other disputes between India and Pakistan can be resolved peacefully.

### （二）印、巴两国关于克什米尔问题会谈的成就

    （二）印、巴两国关于克什米尔问题会谈的成就
    印度总理尼赫鲁和巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里最近在喀喇蚩和德里连续进行了印、巴两国之间关于和平解决克什米尔问题及其他争端的会谈，并发表了联合公报。这对于克什米尔问题的和平解决，促进印、巴两国之间正常关系的发展，是有重大意义的。一切主张用和平协商办法解决国际争端的国家和人民，听到这个消息都感到快慰。
    克什米尔问题是印度和巴基斯坦两国在一九四七年开始分治以来就一直存在而得不到解决的问题。六年多以来，帝国主义者一直利用这个问题，在印度和巴基斯坦之间播弄是非，想尽办法引起两国的不和，甚至使他们发生武装冲突，从而削弱这两个国家，使它们不得不向外国求助。因此，印度和巴基斯坦自分治以来，两国的边境一直保持着紧张的局面，两国的预算一半以上要花在军事费用上，给两国人民带来了极大的痛苦。
    在美国的压力之下，克什米尔问题在一九四八年就被提到联合国安全理事会去“解决”。自从安全理事会开始审查克什米尔问题以来，五年多的时间已经过去了，可是事实证明克什米尔问题不仅没有得到解决，在美国和英国的干涉之下，反而使问题更加复杂化了。在美国的操纵下，联合国安全理事会成立了解决克什米尔问题的委员会，并且早就派遣了“调解人”和“联合国代表”，即美国海军上将尼米兹，长期驻在克什米尔。按照美国的计划，克什米尔人民不能自由无阻碍地表示自己的意愿，以解决关于克什米尔的地位问题，而必须接受“在联合国监督下的公民投票”，即在美国海军上将尼米兹的监督下进行投票，并且还要派遣美国的武装部队去监督。美国硬说需要派遣它的军队到克什米尔，才能促成非军事化和贯彻公民投票。这当然是帝国主义干涉者特有的逻辑。五年多以来联合国“解决”克什米尔问题的事实证明，美国一直企图在联合国旗帜的掩护下，强迫克什米尔人民接受它的“调解”，企图用各种各样的建议来蒙混克什米尔人民并且蒙混印度政府和巴基斯坦政府，以便最后把克什米尔变为它的殖民地和军事基地。正是美国的这种干涉政策，阻碍了印度和巴基斯坦对于克什米尔问题的解决。
    最近克什米尔的局势发展，继续表明美国侵略势力仍然没有放弃阻挠克什米尔问题和平解决并把克什米尔变成它的军事基地的打算。克什米尔新政府不得不采取紧急的措施，制止那些严重干涉克什米尔内政的联合国观察员、美国特务贺克少校等的活动，并将作为美国特务的工具的克什米尔前总理阿布杜拉加以撤职逮捕。这表明克什米尔人民从长期的痛苦经验中，已经开始认识了和平的敌人的阴谋。
    印度和巴基斯坦两国总理所进行的会谈，已经为和平解决克什米尔问题指出了一条明显的道路。他们了解克什米尔人民和印度、巴基斯坦两国人民在解决克什米尔问题上的要求，决定采取两国直接协商的方法，而把那些外国的“调解人”和“观察员”放在一边。他们决定继续努力求得关于举行公民投票的某些先决问题的协议。此外，两国总理还对交换两国飞地问题获得了协议。
    在去年亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议开会期间，出席这个会议的印度和巴基斯坦代表团曾就克什米尔问题发表联合声明，声明中指出：“我们认为，只有查谟和克什米尔邦的全体人民，才有权决定他们自己的命运和前途，而且应该保证他们有自由运用这种权利的机会。我们呼吁印度和巴基斯坦两国人民，立刻采取实际措施，保证查谟和克什米尔邦的全体人民在平等公正的基础上，不受妨碍，无所恐惧，没有偏袒的情况下，自由决定他们未来的命运。”这个声明，得到了印度和巴基斯坦以及克什米尔广大人民的普遍支持和拥护。印度和巴基斯坦两国总理会谈所指出的解决克什米尔问题的道路，与这个联合声明的精神是一致的。这说明了用和平方法解决克什米尔问题，反对外国侵略势力的干涉和阻挠，已经成为印度、巴基斯坦两国以及克什米尔人民和政府的共同见解了。
    印、巴两国总理保证要使两国之间存在着和平与合作的气氛，避免发表和采取使两国之间产生分歧的言论或行动；同时打算彼此保持密切联系，以便在解决争执问题方面能够迅速得到进展。这种友好的协商解决问题的态度，是和平解决一切国际争端的先决条件。喀喇蚩和德里的会谈说明，只要印、巴两国都具有和平的愿望，积极采取措施来实现和平解决克什米尔问题的协议，并继续警惕外国侵略势力的阻挠和挑拨，那么，克什米尔问题和印、巴两国间的其他争端，都是可以得到和平解决的。
