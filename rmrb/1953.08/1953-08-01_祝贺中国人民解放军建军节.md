Telegram of Congratulations from Premier Kim Il-sung of Korea to Chairman Mao:

To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China:

On the occasion of the 26th anniversary of the founding of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army—a true people's armed force and a loyal defender of peace—I, on behalf of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the entire Korean people, and myself, extend warm congratulations to you, the fraternal Chinese people, and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

As the Korean people greet the glorious anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, they express their deep gratitude to the Chinese people for the fraternal assistance they have given to the Korean people in their victorious struggle against the armed aggression of the American imperialist aggressors for the freedom and independence of their country.

I am confident that the people of Korea and China, united in battle and with the just support of all peace-loving people of the world, will be able to thwart any aggressive designs of the enemy in the future.

I wish the Chinese People's Liberation Army continued growth and strength for the prosperity of the People's Republic of China and the lasting peace and security of the world.

The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army has performed glorious and great feats in the long revolutionary struggle against foreign aggressors and domestic reactionaries, and stands like iron at the forefront of defending the fruits of the people's revolution, the peaceful and creative labor of the Chinese people, and maintaining peace and security in Asia.

On the joyous occasion of the 26th anniversary of the founding of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, I, on behalf of the commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and myself, extend warm congratulations to you and all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers. In the just war against the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples, the American aggressors who attempted to disrupt world peace, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, with close coordination in combat, gave the American aggressors a shameful defeat and achieved a great historical victory. This is not only a historical victory achieved by the Korean and Chinese peoples in their common struggle for justice, but also a victory that has made a great contribution to world peace and security, especially to peace and security in Asia.

I wish the commanders and fighters of the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers even more brilliant achievements in the just cause of consolidating the historical victory won through heroic struggle.
