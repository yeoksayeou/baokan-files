Xinhua News Agency, August 30th dispatch: According to TASS Berlin dispatch: On August 26th, more than 100,000 residents from various districts of Berlin held a rally at Marx-Engels Square to hear the report by Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, and Ulbricht, Deputy Prime Minister, on the results of the Soviet-German Moscow talks. Attendees held up placards demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the establishment of a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and the guarantee of peace in Europe and the world.

　　Grotewohl pointed out in his speech that the Berlin people's rally showed that the German people hoped to realize the unification of the country based on the principles of democracy and peace, and they hoped for peace in Europe and the whole world. Then he reported to the masses present on the results of the Moscow talks. He emphasized that the German people must vigorously strengthen their friendship with the Soviet people because, due to their task of striving to establish a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and due to the struggle to defend and consolidate peace, the friendship between the German and Soviet people has become the most important thing.

　　Ulbricht, in his speech, called on German patriots to rely on the democratic achievements of the working people of the German Democratic Republic and the great assistance given to the German people by the Soviet Union, to help the West German people overthrow the Bonn government's anti-people policies, thereby paving the way for all German people to reach an agreement to restore German unification on a democratic basis and to ensure peace.

　　Finally, the meeting unanimously adopted a letter to G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. The letter stated that the people of Berlin supported the specific proposals on the peaceful reunification of Germany in the Soviet government's note of August 15, 1953, and supported the agreements reached during the Moscow talks between the Soviet government and the delegation of the German Democratic Republic government.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 30th dispatch: TASS Moscow, August 27th dispatch:

　　"Pravda" reporter Naumov described in a Berlin dispatch how Adenauer and his henchmen attempted to conceal the results of the Moscow talks from the people.

　　Naumov said that the results of the talks between the Soviet government and the delegation of the German Democratic Republic government had caused panic and confusion in Bonn.

　　Naumov quoted a Bonn dispatch from the German News Agency pointing out that the head of the Federal Press Office, Eckardt, on the orders of Adenauer, convened all the journalists "loyal to the government" on August 24 and ordered them to "report as little as possible" on the "Moscow agreement" between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic before the Federal Parliament elections. Eckardt suggested that in their commentaries they should "express doubts about the Soviet desire for negotiations."

　　The Bonn dispatch also said that a few days ago, Adenauer secretly convened some West German journalists and "severely rebuked" those West German newspapers that had published large excerpts of the Soviet government's note of August 15 to the three Western powers on the German issue.

　　Adenauer told the journalists that in order to prevent the Soviet proposals from influencing the people, the old method of not mentioning the Soviet proposals at all must be adopted.

　　Adenauer also made it clear that the bourgeois newspapers should distort and fabricate facts.

　　Naumov continued that after this instruction was issued, the Bonn newspapers were trying their best not to mention the speech of G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, because they knew that what the Soviet government leader said this time was very important for the German people's struggle for national unification and for the establishment of an independent and peaceful Germany.

　　Naumov said that the Bonn group's attempt to conceal the truth proves the great appeal of the documents summarizing the results of the Moscow talks. Spokespersons from all walks of life in West Germany continue to express their opinions, illustrating unanimous support for the results of the Moscow talks.

　　The voice of the masses shows that despite the Adenauer group's tricks, the truth still penetrates the iron curtain used by the United States to isolate West and East Germany. This truth is fatal to those who lie and slander.

    柏林各区十万人集会拥护苏德会谈的协议
    西德人民拥护苏德会谈结果，阿登纳集团陷于惊惶和混乱
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：八月二十六日，柏林各区十万多居民在马克思—恩格斯广场举行集会，听取德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥与副总理乌布利希报告苏德莫斯科会谈的结果。到会者举着标语牌，要求缔结对德和约，建立一个统一、独立、民主与爱好和平的德国及保证欧洲与世界和平。
    格罗提渥在会上讲话时指出，柏林人民这次集会，表明了德国人民希望根据民主与和平的方针实现国家的统一，他们希望欧洲与全世界和平。接着他向到会群众报告了莫斯科会谈的结果。他强调指出，德国人民一定要大力加强对苏联人民的友谊，因为，由于他们负有争取建立统一、独立、民主与爱好和平的德国的全民族的斗争任务，由于保卫和平与巩固和平的斗争，德国人民与苏联人民的友谊已成为最重要的事情。
    乌布利希在发言中要求德国的爱国者依靠德意志民主共和国劳动人民的民主成就与伟大的苏联给予德国人民的援助，帮助西德人民来打倒波恩政府的反人民的政策，从而为全德人民达成协议以在民主的基础上恢复德国统一铺平道路，并使和平得到保障。
    最后，会议一致通过给苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫的信件。信中说：柏林人民拥护苏联政府一九五三年八月十五日的照会中关于和平统一德国问题的具体建议，并拥护苏联政府与德意志民主共和国政府代表团在莫斯科会谈中所达成的协议。
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：
    “真理报”记者瑙莫夫在一篇柏林电讯中叙述了阿登纳和他的仆从们如何企图对人民隐瞒莫斯科会谈的结果。
    瑙莫夫说，苏联政府与德意志民主共和国政府代表团会谈的结果，已在波恩引起了惊惶和混乱。
    瑙莫夫引用德意志通讯社的一条波恩消息指出，联邦新闻处处长埃卡特奉阿登纳之命，在八月二十四日召集了所有“忠于政府”的记者，令他们在联邦议院选举前“尽可能少报道”苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的“莫斯科协议”。埃卡特建议他们在评论中“对苏联要求谈判的愿望表示怀疑”。
    这条波恩消息还说，几天前，阿登纳暗地召集了一些西德记者，并对那些大量摘发了苏联政府八月十五日就德国问题致西方三国的照会的西德报纸“大加责备”。
    阿登纳对记者说，为了防止苏联的建议对人民发生影响，必须采用根本不提苏联建议的老办法。
    阿登纳也明白表示，资产阶级报纸应该歪曲并捏造事实。
    瑙莫夫继续说，在这番训令发出后，波恩报纸正尽力不提苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫的演说，因为他们知道，苏联政府领袖这次所说的话，对于德国人民争取国家的统一、争取建立一个独立的和平的德国的斗争是十分重要的。
    瑙莫夫说，波恩集团掩蔽真理的企图，证明了总结莫斯科会谈结果的几个文件的巨大感召力。西德各阶层人民的发言人继续不断地表示意见，说明了对莫斯科会谈结果的一致拥护。
    群众的呼声说明，尽管阿登纳集团使尽伎俩，真理还是透过了美国用以隔离西德和东德的铁幕。这个真理对于进行撒谎和诽谤的人，是致命的东西。
