People from all ethnic groups and all strata across the country have spoken to our reporters, warmly welcoming the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

In Dihua, Xinjiang Province, Burhan, Director of the China Islamic Association, said: "The Muslims (believers in Islam) in China congratulate the people of China and North Korea and the peace-loving people of the world on their victory. On behalf of the Muslims, I pay my highest respects to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. We are determined to unite with the Korean people and strive to consolidate peace and achieve the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement." Saifuddin, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, said: "The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a major victory for the people of China and North Korea and the peace-loving people of the world. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, like the people of all ethnic groups across the country, are vigilant against the war-mongering plots of the imperialist warmongers and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang to sabotage the armistice. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will support the Korean people in rebuilding their homeland and restoring production, and will also, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, develop production and build the frontier of the motherland." After hearing the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, citizens of all ethnic groups in the third district of Dihua City, who are carrying out pilot work in universal suffrage, women gathered in courtyards and streets to sing and dance ("Weilang," meaning dancing) to celebrate the victory of the Chinese and Korean people. Zaoerhan, the daughter of "Volunteer Army Mother" Wugunishahan, said: "When my mother was alive, she spun thread day and night and picked up wheat ears to exchange for money to donate to support the Volunteer Army. Now her wish to win the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea and strive for peace has been realized."

In Lanzhou, Ma Zhenwu, Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Association and member of the Northwest Nationalities Affairs Commission, said in his speech on the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement: "The realization of the Korean armistice shows the strength of the people of China and North Korea and the peace-loving people all over the world. However, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang is still clamoring for 'resuming the war.' We can see this very clearly. Syngman Rhee is a puppet in a shadow play, and the warmongers in the United States are manipulating him, so this cannot but arouse our serious vigilance."

Ma Teng'ai, Vice Chairman of the China Hui Nationality Cultural Advancement Association, said in Yinchuan: "The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement marks the victory of the principle of using the spirit of consultation to overcome the use of force in resolving international disputes." He called on the Hui people to further unite closely with all fraternal ethnic groups, heighten their vigilance, and prevent the American warmongers and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang from sabotaging the armistice.

Xirao Gyatso (Tibetan), Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China, said in Xining: "The Tibetan people, like the people of the whole country, are delighted and encouraged by the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and express their warm support. Victory comes from hardship. We thank the heroic Chinese and Korean people's troops and the heroic Korean people. At the time of the signing of the armistice agreement, we feel more deeply the strength of our motherland, and we respect and love our great leader Chairman Mao even more. All our victories are inseparable from Chairman Mao's wise leadership. The signing of the armistice agreement is only the first step in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and imperialism is fickle. Therefore, we must remain vigilant."

When the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement reached the southwestern border of the motherland, people of all ethnic groups expressed their warm welcome. Zhao Cunxin (Dai), Chairman of the People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province, and Dao Jingban (Dai), Chairman of the People's Government of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Region, and Si Nashan (Jingpo), Vice Chairman, also made speeches. Zhao Cunxin said: "The 200,000 ethnic minorities in Xishuangbanna are actively producing and living a peaceful life that has never been seen before. We deeply feel the value of peaceful days. However, we people who have lived on the border for a long time are most familiar with the fickleness of the imperialist warmongers. We must unite more closely and increase our vigilance a hundredfold." Dao Jingban, Si Nashan, and others also unanimously pointed out: After the signing of the armistice agreement, we must vigilantly watch to prevent the agreement from being sabotaged. They also expressed that the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region should unite more closely and, together with the People's Liberation Army, guard the border and protect the happy days of the people of all ethnic groups. People from all walks of life in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province also held discussions to welcome the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

People from all walks of life in Gui Sui City, Ulanhot, Hailar, and other cities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as well as in the northeastern region, welcomed the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement with joy and vigilance. Ha Feng'a (Mongolian), Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's General Sub-Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, said: "The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement clearly proves that peace can defeat war and the spirit of consultation can defeat military aggression. Now, we should still closely monitor the Syngman Rhee reactionary group, under the connivance of the United States, to obstruct the full realization of the armistice agreement and other possible conspiracies of sabotage, and strive for the thorough realization of the Korean armistice and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue." Hong Xingshu, a Korean woman from Shenyang, Northeast China, said: "In the future, our Korean people will, together with the people of the motherland, help our Korean brothers and sisters rebuild their homes, hoping that they will live a happy life like us as soon as possible."

When the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement reached the Tibetan Plateau of the motherland, people from all walks of life in Lhasa and Xigaze expressed their warm welcome.

In Lhasa, the Tibetan News Brief Agency issued more than 3,000 Tibetan "extras." Many citizens took the "extras" and read them happily, and many Tibetans ran to the gate of the Lhasa organ of the People's Liberation Army to listen to the broadcast of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Local government officials in Tibet and people from all walks of life in Tibet have made speeches in support of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Apo Awang Jinmei, Kalon of the local government of Tibet, said: "This is the result of the joint efforts of the Korean people and the people of the motherland. This is a great joy. I wish you 'Tashi Delek' (auspicious and good luck) according to the customs of our Tibetan people. However, we must be vigilant. We must strengthen the construction of the new Tibet, consolidate the national defense of the motherland, make the motherland stronger, and smash any aggression conspiracy of the imperialist warmongers."

Zeren Zhuoma (the Dalai Lama's sister), who attended the Vienna World People's Peace Conference, said: "When we saw the pain and disasters suffered by the people of Vienna in World War II, and the desolate traces of war destruction, we hated war and hoped for peace. Today, the Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed, which is a great victory for the people of China and North Korea and the peace-loving people of the world in defending world peace."

Jiang Lejin Gong, Director of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Friendship Association, said: "The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is the first step in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, which is a major event that the peace-loving people all over the world are eager for and care about. However, the peaceful resolution of the entire Korean issue still depends on the efforts of the people of China and North Korea and the peace-loving people all over the world. We must vigorously help the Korean people rebuild their homes so that they can live a peaceful and happy life."

In Xigaze, Zhashi Ji Jinmei of the Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall said: "The fact that the Korean armistice negotiations were able to reach an agreement is a great victory for the peace-loving people all over the world, and the result of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers faithfully defending world peace and protecting the security of the motherland. In the future, we must continue to fully support the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, strengthen the unity within and between ethnic groups, accelerate the construction of the new Tibet, and consolidate the national defense of the motherland." Lhamin Yixi Chuchen, Secretary-General of the Kanpo Conference Hall, Kaimo Yixi Zhuoma, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Xigaze Patriotic Youth Cultural Friendship Association, and Qaba Zedan Pengcuo, Director of Teaching Affairs of Xigaze Primary School, also made speeches. They unanimously pointed out: The agreement reached in the Korean armistice negotiations is the result of the consistent wishes and efforts of the people of our country. However, in the future, we must still be vigilant at all times against the conspiracies and instigations of imperialism, unite more closely with the fraternal ethnic groups in the great family of the motherland, and strive for lasting world peace.

    朝鲜停战协定签字的消息传到祖国西南边疆时，各族人民都表示热烈欢迎。云南省西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府主席召存信（傣族），和德宏傣族景颇族自治区人民政府主席刀京版（傣族）、副主席思纳山（景颇族）等都发表了谈话。召存信说：西双版纳二十万少数民族人民，正在积极生产，过着从来没有过的安宁生活，我们深深感到和平日子的可贵。但是，我们长期住在边疆的人们，最熟悉帝国主义好战分子的反复无常，我们要更加紧密团结，百倍地提高警惕。刀京版、思纳山等也一致指出：停战协定签字后，要警惕地注视着不使协定遭受破坏。他们并表示自治区各族人民更要紧密团结，和人民解放军一道，守卫边疆，保卫各族人民幸福的日子。西康省藏族自治区各族各界人民，也举行座谈，欢迎朝鲜停战协定签字。

    当朝鲜停战协定签字的消息传到祖国西藏高原的时候，拉萨市和日喀则市的各阶层人士都表示热烈欢迎。
    在拉萨，藏文新闻简讯社发出了三千多份藏文号外。很多市民拿着“号外”高兴地阅读，还有许多藏民跑到人民解放军驻拉萨机关的门口听朝鲜停战协定签字的广播。
    西藏地方政府官员、藏族各阶层人士都发表谈话，拥护朝鲜停战协定。西藏地方政府噶伦阿沛·阿旺晋美说：这是朝鲜人民和祖国人民并肩努力的结果，这是个大喜事。我按我们西藏人民的习惯祝以“扎西德来”（吉祥如意）。但是，我们必须提高警惕。我们要加强新西藏的建设，巩固祖国国防，使祖国变得更加强大，粉碎任何帝国主义好战分子的侵略阴谋。
    曾出席维也纳世界人民和平大会的泽仁卓玛（达赖喇嘛的姐姐）说：当我们看到维也纳人民在第二次世界大战中遭到的痛苦、灾难，看到被战争所毁坏的凄凉痕迹时，我们万分地愤恨战争，而希望和平。今天朝鲜停战协定签字了，这是中朝人民和全世界爱好和平人民保卫世界和平的伟大胜利。
    拉萨市爱国青年文化联谊会主任委员江乐金公说：朝鲜停战协定签字是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步，这是全世界爱好和平人民所渴望和关心的大事。但是整个朝鲜问题的和平解决，还有待于中朝两国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的努力。我们要大力帮助朝鲜人民重建家园，使他们能过和平幸福的生活。
    在日喀则，班禅堪布会议厅札萨计晋美发表谈话说：“朝鲜停战谈判能够达成协议，是全世界爱好和平人民的伟大胜利，是英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军忠心保卫世界和平保卫祖国安全的结果。今后我们一定继续以全力支援进藏人民解放军，加强民族内部与民族之间的团结，加紧建设新西藏，巩固祖国的国防。”堪布会议厅秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣、日喀则市爱国青年文化联谊会筹备委员会副主任凯墨·益西卓玛和日喀则小学教务主任恰白·择丹彭错等都发表了谈话。他们一致指出：朝鲜停战谈判达成协议，是我国人民一贯的愿望和一贯努力的结果。但是，我们今后仍须时时刻刻警惕帝国主义的阴谋挑拨，与祖国大家庭中的各兄弟民族更加紧密的团结起来，为争取世界持久和平而努力。    （新华社）
