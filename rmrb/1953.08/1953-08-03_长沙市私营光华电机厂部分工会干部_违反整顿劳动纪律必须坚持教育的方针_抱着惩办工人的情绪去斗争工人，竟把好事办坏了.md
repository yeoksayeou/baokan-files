Some Union Cadres of the Private Guanghua Electric Motor Factory in Changsha
Violated the Principle of Education in Rectifying Labor Discipline
Spoiled a Good Thing by Fighting Workers with the Mentality of Punishing Them

Some union cadres of the private Guanghua Electric Motor Factory in Changsha did not sufficiently understand the principle of education in rectifying labor discipline. In the work of rectifying labor discipline, they adopted simple and crude methods of struggle against workers, causing very bad results.

In the past, union cadres of Guanghua Electric Motor Factory always dared not or were unwilling to intervene in the phenomenon of some workers not observing labor discipline, fearing that this would cause dissatisfaction among the masses and "divorce themselves from the masses."

In mid-June, Changsha factories began to rectify labor discipline. After listening to the report of the higher-level union, Guo Zonghui, chairman of the Guanghua Electric Motor Factory union, misunderstood how to correct the past mistakes of not daring to intervene in labor discipline and "tailism." He mistakenly believed that it was no longer feasible to talk about education to workers, and it was necessary to severely "discipline" them in order to do a good job in rectifying labor discipline. Therefore, when the factory began preparing for the rectification of labor discipline, he did not conduct in-depth investigations and analysis, but instead sought out bad examples to "discipline" with a pure mentality of punishing workers.

Guo Zonghui and two union committee members found Xu Yinping as a typical example of violating labor discipline. Xu Yinping was an apprentice entrusted by the Labor Bureau to the factory for training. He was twenty years old this year. He was originally a worker in a sewing shop. After entering the factory last year, because the union had not seriously educated him, he often violated labor discipline. For example, he would take half a day off on average every week to do private matters, and he liked to quarrel and fight. Because he received low wages, he once said, "I will do work worth 700 yuan a day if I get 700 yuan a day." The union cadres usually thought he was a difficult person to educate. When the factory was preparing to carry out the rectification of labor discipline, Xu Yinping again felt unwell and consulted a doctor and took tonics because "the weather was too hot and he didn't sleep well." The union chairman believed even more that he was pretending to be sick and taking tonics, and decided to use him as the worst example to "discipline."

Before the meeting to criticize Xu Yinping, the union did not conduct ideological education on the rectification of labor discipline for the workers. Many workers did not understand that not observing labor discipline was an act that harmed the fundamental interests of the working class and damaged the reputation of the working class. Guo Zonghui and the two union committee members were afraid that other union cadres and the masses would object if they knew about the meeting to criticize Xu Yinping, so they did not talk about it among the other seven committee members and the workers. Even when sending out notices before the meeting, they were afraid of leaks, and the notice only said "make a report on the rectification of labor discipline." Xu Yinping, who was identified as a bad example, had not even been talked to once beforehand. Because of this, at the general meeting, the masses who attended did not speak, and the union chairman's repeated calls were useless. There was no way but for union committee members Wang Lansheng and Guo Zonghui to personally come forward, severely scolding Xu Yinping, and then letting people who had quarreled with Xu Yinping in the past and had private opinions against him to make "criticisms." Worker Wan Yimin had seen Xu Yinping fight with others, and the union chairman forced him to stand up and "supplement the details of the fight." The workers were very dissatisfied with this situation and automatically withdrew from the union. Xu Yinping repeatedly asked to speak at the meeting, but was refused. Finally, the union chairman and the organization committee member made a summary, saying, "The comrades at the meeting were unanimously dissatisfied with him and wanted to ask the higher-level union to transfer the request to the Labor Bureau to 'send him back for further education.'" (Meaning: they would no longer allow him to work at the Guanghua Electric Motor Factory)

After the meeting, the workers called this meeting a "struggle meeting," and about three-quarters of the factory opposed this approach. The majority of the masses sympathized with Xu Yinping instead. Xu Yinping's ideological problem was not resolved, and as a result, he became even more indifferent. Some people who had the same problems with violating labor discipline and work style became afraid and dissatisfied.

In this way, a good thing that conformed to the interests of the workers was turned into a bad thing.

    长沙市私营光华电机厂部分工会干部
    违反整顿劳动纪律必须坚持教育的方针
    抱着惩办工人的情绪去斗争工人，竟把好事办坏了
    长沙市私营光华电机厂部分工会干部，对整顿劳动纪律工作必须坚持教育的方针认识不够，在整顿劳动纪律工作中，对工人采用了简单粗暴的斗争方式，造成很坏的结果。
    过去，光华电机厂工会干部，对于厂里部分工人不遵守劳动纪律的现象，始终不敢过问，也不愿过问，怕因此惹起群众不满，“脱离群众”。
    六月中旬，长沙市各工厂开始进行整顿劳动纪律的工作。光华电机厂的工会主席郭宗辉听了上级工会的报告后，对如何纠正过去不敢过问劳动纪律、“尾巴主义”的错误，有了曲解，错误地认为如今对工人再谈教育已经行不通了，必须狠狠地整他们一下，整顿劳动纪律的工作才能做好。所以当厂里开始了整顿劳动纪律的准备工作时，他就没有进行深入调查与分析，而是带着单纯惩办工人的情绪，找坏典型来“整”。
    郭宗辉和两个工会委员找到了徐银平作违反劳动纪律的典型。徐银平是劳动局委托厂里代训的一个学徒，今年二十岁，他原先是缝纫店里的工人，去年入厂后，因为工会一直没有认真对他进行过教育，因此，就常常发生违反劳动纪律的事情。如他每周平均要请半天假干私人的事，平时喜欢扯皮打架，因为工资拿得少，他曾说过“一天拿七百块钱，就做七百块钱的活”的话。工会干部平时就认为他是一个很难教育的人，而在厂里准备开展整顿劳动纪律的工作的时候，徐银平又因“天气太热，没睡好觉”，感到身体不舒服，请医生看病，并吃补药，这样工会主席就更认为他是无病装病吃补药，便决定把他作为最坏的典型来“整”。
    在开会批评徐银平之前，工会没有对工人群众进行有关整顿劳动纪律的思想教育。许多工人还不懂得不遵守劳动纪律是损害工人阶级根本利益和败坏工人阶级名誉的行为。郭宗辉和两个工会委员怕工会其他干部和群众先知道了开会批评徐银平这件事，会提出反对，因此，在工会其他七个委员和工人群众中，一直没有谈过这回事。甚至在开会前发通知，也怕走了风声，通知上只写了“作整顿劳动纪律报告”几个字。被确定为坏典型的徐银平，更没有任何人先和他谈过一次话。因为这样，在开大会时，到会的群众都不发言，工会主席再三喊叫也没有用。没有办法，只有工会委员王兰生和郭宗辉两人亲自出马，指着徐银平狠狠地教训了一顿，又让过去和徐银平扯过皮、闹过私人意见的人向他提出“批评”。工人万一民，曾经见过徐银平和别人打架，工会主席就逼着他起来“补充打架情况”。工人看到这种情形，很为不满，纷纷自动退会。徐银平在会上，曾再三要求发言，均被拒绝。最后，工会主席和组织委员作总结，说“大会上同志们一致对他不满意，要请上级工会转请劳动局，把他‘调回去加强教育’。”（意思就是：不再让他在光华电机厂做工了）
    会后，工人都把这个会叫做“斗争会”，全厂四分之三左右的人都反对这样做法，多数群众反而同情徐银平。徐银平的思想问题本来没有解决，这样一来，他就更无所谓了。一些和徐银平同样违反劳动纪律和作风有毛病的人，都产生了害怕和不满情绪。
    这样，就把一件符合工人利益的好事办成了坏事。
