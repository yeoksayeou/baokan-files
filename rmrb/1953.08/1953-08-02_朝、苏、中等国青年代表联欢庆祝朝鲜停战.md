Finally, he proposed that everyone toast the victory.

    Hu Yaobang, head of the Chinese youth delegation, congratulated the Korean people on their great victory and paid tribute to the Korean people and youth under the leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung. When Hu Yaobang congratulated the people and youth of China and Korea on the further consolidation and development of the fraternal friendship forged with blood in the anti-aggression struggle, the audience applauded and cheered enthusiastically.

    The get-together proceeded in a warm atmosphere, with guests and hosts frequently toasting the victory and peace, and singing the glorious names of the leaders of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union.

    Finally, everyone danced happily on the lawn, and the get-together did not end until late at night.

    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest: Youth representatives from various countries attending the Third World Youth Congress warmly welcomed the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    An American youth representative said: The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a great victory for the Korean people, the Chinese people, and the American people, and a victory for peace. The greatest hope of American youth has finally been realized. We guarantee to continue to fight with all our strength to ensure that there will never be another war in Korea and that there will be no new wars anywhere else in the world.

    British youth representative John Morse said that for Britain, the realization of the Korean armistice would allow British youth in Korea to return home and relieve the suffering of their mothers and wives. At the same time, we must always be vigilant to prevent any sabotage and obstruction, and prevent any new threats of aggression. For the British people, the Korean armistice will bring them new hope and will give a new upsurge to our country's peace movement to shorten conscription periods, reduce armaments, and strive for consultations between major powers.

    Indian representative Sinha said that the signing of the armistice agreement was not because the forces of war wanted peace, but because they had to accept peace under the pressure of the majority of the people in the world, because the Korean people, with the support of the Chinese people, had severely struck at the conspiracies of the forces of war. This is a great victory for the peace-loving people of the world. It will be a major step towards world peace. We, the Indian people and youth, will work harder with the people of the world to strive for the full realization of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    Abdul Karim Mroue, head of the Lebanese delegation, said: "This event has great significance for the youth of our country and the youth and people of the whole world. It is a brilliant victory for the forces of peace. It will surely inspire the youth of the whole world who are working together to maintain peace."

    朝、苏、中等国青年代表联欢庆祝朝鲜停战
    【新华社布加勒斯特三十一日电】出席第三届世界青年代表大会的朝鲜青年代表团，七月二十九日晚和苏联、中国及其他各国的青年代表团举行盛大的联欢会，庆祝朝鲜停战协定的签字。
    朝鲜青年艺术团的团员们首先表演了歌舞节目。
    接着朝鲜青年代表团团长金基洙（前译金基苏）致词。他说，朝鲜停战协定的签字是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利。他向全世界一切爱好和平的人们致敬。金基洙说，朝鲜青年今后在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅领导下将努力完成和平建设的任务。最后他提议大家为胜利而干杯。
    中国青年代表团团长胡耀邦祝贺朝鲜人民的伟大胜利，并向金日成元帅领导下的朝鲜人民和青年致敬。当胡耀邦祝贺中朝两国人民和青年在反侵略斗争中用鲜血凝成的兄弟友谊更加巩固和发展时，全场热烈鼓掌和欢呼。
    联欢会在热烈的气氛下进行，宾主频频为胜利、为和平而干杯，为朝、中、苏三国领袖的光荣名字而歌唱。
    最后大家在草坪上愉快地跳起舞来，联欢会直到深夜才结束。
    据新华社布加勒斯特讯：出席第三届世界青年代表大会的各国青年代表们热烈欢迎朝鲜停战协定的签订。
    一位美国青年代表说：朝鲜停战协定的签订是朝鲜人民、中国人民和美国人民的伟大胜利，是和平的胜利。美国青年的最大希望终于实现了。我们保证继续全力斗争，争取朝鲜永远不会再发生战争，争取世界上其他任何地方不再发生新的战争。
    英国青年代表约翰·摩斯说，对于英国来说，朝鲜停战的实现，将使在朝鲜的英国青年得以重返家园，而解除他们的母亲和妻子的痛苦。同时，我们必须永远保持警惕，防止任何破坏和阻挠，防止任何新的侵略威胁。对于英国人民来说，朝鲜停战将给他们带来新的希望，并将使我国争取缩短征兵期限、裁减军备、争取大国协商的和平运动有新的高涨。
    印度代表辛哈说，停战协定的签订，并不是因为战争势力要和平，而是因为在世界大多数人民的压力下他们不得不接受和平，是因为朝鲜人民在中国人民的支援下严重地打击了战争势力的阴谋，这是世界爱好和平人民的伟大胜利。它将是走向世界和平的一个重大的步骤。我们印度人民和青年将和世界人民一起，更加努力来争取朝鲜停战协定的完全实现。
    黎巴嫩代表团团长阿卜杜勒·卡林·姆鲁伊说：“这件事对我国青年以及全世界青年和人民说来，具有重大的意义，它是和平力量的光辉的胜利。它定将给为维护和平而共同努力的全世界青年以鼓舞。”
