    New China's First Giant Open-Pit Coal Mine

    Dear Liberation Army Comrades guarding the coasts:

    Have you heard of the massive Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine? In your spare time from training, or after annihilating pirates attempting to intrude, sitting on the coast, looking at the rolling ocean, talking about the motherland behind you, do you also talk about the construction of this open-pit coal mine? I want to tell you about this open-pit coal mine, which was officially handed over for production and began producing coal on July 1st. On that day, I was also honored to participate in the handover ceremony, and I admired the overall picture of this great construction project of New China.

    This is a long rectangular valley, more than seven li long from east to west, three li wide from north to south, and thirty meters deep. In the valley, the black and shiny coal seams are exposed, looking like a black river from a distance. The newly painted large electric shovels, with their mouths wide open, stand quietly next to the coal face; the self-tipping trucks, decorated with red ribbons and flowers, are also neatly arranged one after another on the railway. Further away, at the exit of the large open pit, railways crisscross, and electric wires are intertwined, leading directly to the dispatch room that commands the entire mine's production.

    The salute was fired, and as the Soviet-style electric shovel stretched out its long mouth and spat the chunks of coal into the carriages, as the first self-tipping truck roared into motion, people braved the heavy rain and rushed over, throwing bouquets of flowers at the electric locomotive.

    Faced with this scene, who would have thought that just two years ago, this was a desolate place where all you saw was a field of crops and all you heard was the croaking of frogs?

    To build this coal mine, the amount of earthwork already excavated is 12.7 million cubic meters. According to the plan, the open-pit coal mine will be dug to a depth of 350 meters in the future. If it is completed, the amount of earthwork excavated will be dozens of times more than now, which is almost equal to the total amount of earthwork used to build the Great Wall of China in ancient times. Not to mention that two years later, when the open-pit coal mine reaches its planned output, if the coal it produces in one year is used to generate electricity, it can generate 4.3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. If this electricity is used for lighting, every family in China will be able to shine in its brilliance! Comrades, think about it, what a huge project this is!

    Such a huge project, as imagined by ordinary people, should have tens of thousands of workers working here! No, that's not the case, comrades! Almost all the operating processes here are mechanized, and machines have replaced the labor of tens of thousands of people. The large electric shovels, weighing 165 tons and 200 tons, look like buildings. One mouthful can swallow three cubic meters of soil, and in less than half a minute, it can transport the soil to the self-tipping carriage. It can replace at least 800 people's work. After the carriage is full, it is pulled by an electric locomotive to a dumping ground more than ten kilometers away. There, you only need to press a switch, and the soil will automatically tip out. If you stand in front of the dispatch room, you can see such a self-tipping truck passing by every five minutes. A comrade who participated in the Huai River project was surprised when he visited here for the first time and asked, "Are you on vacation today? Why don't I see many workers working?" The comrade who accompanied him on the visit replied with a smile, "We only have these workers here, look, they are all busy in the driver's cabs!"

    Speaking of these workers, it is especially exciting! Comrade Zhu Wei, for example, was an unsophisticated farmer two years ago, but now he has become a famous electric shovel driver. When he first arrived at the open-pit coal mine site from the countryside, he was so scared that he ran away when he saw the electric shovel open its mouth. However, this novel thing attracted him after all. He saw that this electric shovel swallowed such a large pile of soil with one mouth, twisted its neck, and dumped it into the carriage. He thought, "This one thing is equivalent to the work of thousands of people. Without it, I don't know when the open-pit coal mine would be developed!" He made up his mind to learn how to operate an electric shovel.

    When he first got on the machine, the machine oil made his brain ache. In addition, the vibration of the machine all day long made him vomit as soon as he got off work. The master advised him to rest for a few days, but he said, "Learning one day later will affect the mining of the open-pit coal mine. It doesn't matter if my head hurts a little, I'll get through it in two days!" So, he went to work to learn, researched after work, and even dreamed of operating an electric shovel when he slept at night. In this way, after more than half a year of painstaking research, he has become an expert in driving electric shovels. Their team has also continuously created new records and completed the production tasks for the first half of this year 55 days ahead of schedule. Like Zhu Wei, almost half of the workers here have been transformed from farmers into workers who can master modern machines.

    Here, we cannot fail to thank the help of the Soviet people. Not only is there concrete guidance from Soviet experts in design and construction, but also the latest and most powerful machines, such as electric shovels, electric locomotives, graders, bulldozers... are all shipped from the Soviet Union.

    The scale of support from the people of the whole country for the open-pit coal mine is even greater. Here, there are sleepers from the forest areas of Inner Mongolia, steel rails from Chongqing No. 101 Factory, the first batch of grooved trolley lines manufactured by Shanghai Electric Wire Factory in New China, and graders sent from the Northwest Xianyang Petroleum Administration..., Fushun Electric Factory is also trial-producing DC lightning arresters for the open-pit coal mine that China has never produced before! These supported materials can fill more than 1,600 train cars, and if the cars are connected together, they can be 34 li long! During the spring plowing season this year, the farmers of Fuxin County heard that the open-pit coal mine was short of more than 10,000 cubic meters of stone, so they automatically took time out from their busy farming to serve the open-pit coal mine. In just twenty-three days, more than 500 women in the Fourteenth District completed 14,000 cubic meters of quarrying tasks!

    The Chinese People's Volunteers, although far away from the motherland, fighting on the land of Korea, are also always concerned about the construction of the open-pit coal mine. In April this year, the workers of the open-pit coal mine received a letter written on March 30th by Chen Shengzhong, a soldier of a artillery company of a certain unit of the Volunteers guarding the Jincheng front line in Korea. In the letter, after describing the encouragement the construction of the open-pit coal mine gave them, he wrote excitedly: "The comrades in our company have been clamoring to give you a gift for a long time, but it wasn't until today that we managed to prepare it. In eight minutes, we annihilated two enemy artillery companies, destroyed 19 enemy trucks, five jeeps, and a large amount of military supplies. This has subdued the enemy's frenzied counterattack, and they don't even dare to stick their heads out."

    This letter fell into the hands of the workers of Ding Xiaoyun's team. They immediately held a discussion and decided to respond to the Volunteers' concern with new production achievements. As a result, they completed a month's production plan five days ahead of schedule!

    Letters from the Korean front line and from factories, mines, rural areas, government agencies, and schools all over the country are a great encouragement to the workers, and new production records are constantly emerging. The construction projects completed in the second quarter of this year alone are equal to 60% of the total amount of projects in the past two years (excluding stripping), and they completed the preparations for the "July 1st" handover of production eight days ahead of schedule! The workers all said, "Go for it, the people of the whole country are watching us!"

    Comrades, when talking about the support and encouragement of the people of the whole country for the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine, I have never forgotten your immeasurable contribution to all the construction of the motherland, which naturally includes the construction of the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine. The thing is like this: Without you vigilantly guarding the coastal defense line of the motherland, there would be no increasingly prosperous economic construction of the motherland. The remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits who invaded Dongshan Island on July 16 have been completely defeated by the coastal defense troops stationed there. We believe that if the enemy dares to take the risk again, they will suffer an even greater defeat. Under your defense, the Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine has seen many new production records. Please believe that under your defense, even higher new production records will appear. Let us contribute all our strength to the safety and prosperity of the motherland! (Attached photo)

    新中国第一座巨型露天煤矿
    陈旗亲爱的守卫在海防上的解放军同志们：
    你们听说过规模巨大的阜新海州露天煤矿吗？在你们练兵的余暇，或者是歼灭了妄想窜扰的海盗之后，坐在海滨，看着面前翻滚的海洋，谈起背后的祖国，这时候，你们也谈到这个露天煤矿建设的情景吗？我要告诉你们的，正是这个于七月一日移交生产正式出煤的露天煤矿。当天我也荣幸地参加了移交生产的典礼，在参观台上，瞻仰了这个新中国建设的伟大工程之一的全貌。
    这是一条东西长七里多、南北宽三里、深三十公尺的长方形的深谷。谷里，闪露着黑黝黝的煤层，远远望去，就好像一条黑色的河流。新油漆的大电铲，张大着嘴，静静地矗立在煤掌子旁边；披红带彩的自翻车，也一列挨一列地整齐地排列在铁道上。再往远处看，在大露天的出口处，铁道纵横，电线交错，可一直通到指挥全矿生产的调度室。
    礼炮响了，当苏联式的电铲伸出长嘴把啃下的煤块吐进车厢，当第一列自翻车发出隆隆的吼声开动了的时候，人们冒着大雨，欢呼着涌了过去，把一束束的鲜花向电机车投去。
    面对着这种场面，谁能想到两年前这里看到的还只是一片庄稼，听到的只是一片蛙声的荒凉地方呢？
    建设这个煤矿，光已开的土方就有一千二百七十万立方公尺。按照计划，露天煤矿将来要挖到三百五十公尺深，要是完成的话，挖出的土方比现在还要多出几十倍，这几乎等于我国古代修筑万里长城时所用的全部土方量。这还不说，两年后，当露天煤矿达到计划的产量时，如用它一年出产的煤炭来发电，就可发出四十三亿度电量，要把这些电量用来发光，咱全中国每一家人都能够照到它的光辉！同志们，想想看，这是多么巨大的工程啊！
    这样巨大的工程，按照一般人的想像，该有成千上万的工人在这里干活吧！不，不是这样的，同志们！这里的一切操作过程几乎全都机械化了，机器，已经代替了成千上万人的劳动。体重一百六十五吨和二百吨的大电铲，看起来就像一座楼房似的，一张嘴就能吞掉三立方公尺的土块，不到半分钟的功夫，就可以把土运到自翻车厢里，它至少可以代替八百人以上的工作。车厢装满后，便被电机车牵引到十公里以外的排土场里，在那里，你只要一按开关，土块就会自动地翻倒出来。你要站在调度室前面，每隔五分钟就可以看到一列这样的自翻车通过。一个参加过治淮工程的同志，头一次到这里参观时，惊奇地问道：“你们今天是休假吧，怎么看不到许多工人干活呢？”陪他一块参观的同志笑着答道：“我们这里就这些工人，瞧，都在司机台上忙着哩！”
    说到这些工人，尤其令人兴奋！像朱伟同志，两年前还是个没见过世面的农民，现在已成为著名的电铲司机了。他从农村乍来到露天煤矿工地时，看见电铲一张嘴，吓得撒腿就跑。可是，这个新奇的玩艺儿究竟把他吸引住了。他看见这个电铲一张嘴就吞下了恁大一堆土，脖子一扭，就把它倒在车厢里了，他想：“这一个玩艺就抵得上千把个人的工作，要没有它，开发露天煤矿也不知要到那年那月！”他下了决心，要学习开电铲。
    他开始一上机台，机械油薰的脑子直发疼，再加上整天机器的震动，他一下班就呕吐。师傅劝他休息几天，他说：“晚学会一天，就会影响到露天煤矿的开采，脑袋疼点不算什么，挺两天就过去了！”于是，他就上班学习，下班研究，连晚上睡了觉都梦到在开电铲。就这样，经过半年多的苦心钻研，他已经成为驾驶电铲的能手了。他们的小组还连续创造了新纪录，提前五十五天完成了今年上半年的生产任务。像朱伟这样，由农民变成了能掌握现代化机器的工人，几乎占了这里工人总数的一半。
    这里，我们不能不感谢苏联人民的帮助，不但设计和施工，都有苏联专家的具体指导，就是各种最新式的效力强大的机器，像电铲、电机车、平道机、堆土机……也都是从苏联运来的。
    全国人民对露天煤矿支援的规模更是巨大的。这里，有来自内蒙森林区的枕木，有来自重庆一○一厂的钢轨，有来自上海电线厂制造的新中国第一批的沟型电车线，也有从西北咸阳石油管理局送来的平道机……，抚顺电工厂还在为露天煤矿试制着中国从来未生产过的直流避雷器哩！这些支援的物资可装满一千六百多个车皮，要是把车皮连接起来，可以排三十四里长！今年春耕时节，阜新县的农民听说露天煤矿缺少一万多立方公尺的石头，就在农忙中自动抽出人来，为露天煤矿服务。光十四区的五百多个妇女，在二十三天内就完成了一万四千立方公尺的采石任务！
    中国人民志愿军，虽然远离祖国，战斗在朝鲜的土地上，但也时刻关怀着露天煤矿的建设。今年四月露天煤矿的工人们接到守卫在朝鲜金城前线志愿军某部炮兵连战士陈声忠于三月三十日写的一封信，信上在叙述了露天煤矿的建设对他们的鼓舞之后，兴奋地写道：“我们连里的同志，很早就嚷着要给你们送一个礼物，可是直到今天，才算筹备齐了。我们在八分钟内，歼灭了敌军两个炮兵连，炸毁敌人十九辆卡车，五辆吉普车，还有大量的军用物资。这一下可制服了敌人的疯狂反攻，他们连脑袋都不敢探出来了。”
    这封信落到了丁笑云小组工人的手里。他们马上开了讨论会，决定用新的生产成就来回答志愿军的关怀。结果提前五天完成了一个月的生产计划！
    从朝鲜前线和从祖国各地的工厂、矿山、农村、机关、学校雪片似的来信对工人们是极大的鼓舞，因而生产上的新纪录也在不断出现。光今年第二季度完成的建设工程，就等于过去两年工程总量的百分之六十（剥离除外），还提前八天完成了“七一”移交生产的准备工作！工人们都说：“干哪，全国人民都在看着咱们哩！”
    同志们，在谈到全国人民对阜新海州露天煤矿的支援和鼓舞时，我始终没有忘记你们对祖国的一切建设，其中自然也包括对阜新海州露天煤矿建设的无可估量的贡献。事情就是这样的：没有你们警惕地守卫在祖国的海防线上，也就没有祖国日趋繁荣的经济建设。七月十六日窜犯东山岛的蒋介石残余匪军，已被守卫在那里的海防部队彻底打垮了，我们相信，敌人若敢再来冒险，他们将会遭到更大的失败。阜新海州露天煤矿在你们的捍卫下，已经出现了很多生产新纪录，请你们相信，在你们的捍卫下，还会出现更高的生产新纪录。让我们为了祖国的安全和繁荣贡献一切力量吧！（附图片）
