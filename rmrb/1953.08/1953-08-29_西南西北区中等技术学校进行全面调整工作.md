    Southwest and Northwest Regions Carry Out Comprehensive Adjustment of Secondary Technical Schools
    (Xinhua News Agency) In order to meet the needs of national construction, the secondary technical schools in the Southwest and Northwest regions are undergoing comprehensive adjustments. It is expected that the adjustments can be completed before the fall semester this year. After the adjustment in the Southwest region, engineering and agricultural schools will develop considerably. Engineering will enroll 4,200 new students, and agriculture will enroll 800 new students. After the adjustment of industrial secondary technical schools in the Northwest region, the enrollment quota will increase from 7,500 to 9,600.
    The Southwest region originally had 66 secondary technical schools in industry, agriculture, and finance, with a total of more than 23,000 students. These schools generally had poor equipment, complex departments, and a lack of teachers. The Southwest Higher Education Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government conducted a survey of secondary technical schools in the Southwest region in accordance with the central instructions and formulated an adjustment plan based on the principles of simplification and specialization.
    In this adjustment in the Southwest region, the schools or departments with similar characteristics among the original 27 industrial technical schools were merged and concentrated to form 22 industrial technical schools. For example, the Southwest Construction Engineering School and Chongqing No. 1 Civil Engineering School were merged to establish Chongqing Construction Engineering School; Kunming Industrial School of Yunnan Province and Gejiu Mining School of Yunnan Province were merged to become Kunming Nonferrous Metal Industry School. Schools established by merging departments from relevant schools include Chongqing Electrical Engineering and Civil Engineering School, Chongqing Machinery Industry School, and Chengdu Industrial School of Sichuan Province, all of which are specialized schools. The newly established schools include Chongqing Electric Power School and Luzhou Chemical Industry School of Sichuan Province. After this adjustment, the problem of teachers in various schools has been initially resolved, and the equipment has been greatly improved. The Southwest region originally had 12 financial secondary technical schools, which will be adjusted to become seven specialized financial schools. The former Southwest Industrial Cadre School was renamed Chongqing Industrial and Mining Accounting and Statistics School. There were originally 27 agricultural secondary technical schools, which will be adjusted to 18, including nine for agronomy, two each for comprehensive and animal husbandry majors, and one each for agriculture and forestry, sericulture, and vegetable gardening. In order to develop the agricultural and forestry industry in the Southwest region, Sichuan Guanxian Agricultural and Forestry School and Xikang Xichang Agricultural and Forestry School were established in the forest areas of Sichuan and Xikang respectively.
    In this adjustment of industrial secondary technical schools in the Northwest region, in addition to merging comprehensive industrial schools according to their nature to establish specialized schools, new industrial schools for coal mines, geology, and railways were also established. After this adjustment, the total number of industrial secondary technical schools in the Northwest region will increase from the original 16 to 17. Among these specialized schools, 37 majors will be set up in machinery, petroleum, coal mining, geology, mining geology, textile, construction, railway, highway, and water conservancy.

    西南西北区中等技术学校进行全面调整工作
    为适应国家建设的需要，西南、西北地区的中等技术学校正进行全面的调整工作。预计在今年秋季开学前，可以调整完成。西南区调整以后，工科和农科学校将有相当发展。工科招收新生四千二百名，农科招收新生八百名。西北区工业性质中等技术学校调整后招生名额将由七千五百名增加到九千六百名。
    西南区原有工业、农业及财经中等技术学校六十六所，共有学生二万三千多人。这些学校一般设备较差，分科庞杂，师资缺乏。中央人民政府高等教育部西南高等教育管理局根据中央指示，对西南区各中等技术学校进行了调查，根据单一化、专业化的原则制定了调整方案。
    西南区这次调整，将原有二十七所工业技术学校中性质相近的学校或科系分别合并集中，调整为二十二所工业技术学校。如西南建筑工程学校和重庆第一土木建筑学校合并，成立重庆市建筑工程学校；云南省昆明工业学校与云南省个旧矿业学校合并成为昆明有色金属工业学校。从有关学校合并系科成立的学校有重庆市电业土木工程学校、重庆市机器工业学校及四川省成都工业学校等专业化学校。新建立的学校有重庆市电力学校和四川省泸州化学工业学校。经过这次调整，各校的师资问题已得到初步解决，设备也大为改善。西南区财经性质的中等技术学校原有十二所，调整后将成为专业性的财经学校七所，原西南工业干部学校改为重庆市工矿会计统计学校。农业性质的中等技术学校原有二十七所，调整后为十八所，其中农学的九所，综合性及畜牧专业的各两所，农林、蚕桑及菜蔬园艺等专业的各一所。为了发展西南区的农林事业，在四川和西康的森林区，分别成立四川省灌县农林学校和西康省西昌农林学校。
    西北区这次调整工业性质的中等技术学校，除将综合性的工业学校，按其性质相同的学科分别合并成立专业学校外，并新建煤矿、地质和铁路等工业学校。经过这次调整后，西北区工业性质的中等技术学校的总数将由原来的十六所增加到十七所。在这些专科学校中，将设置机械、石油、煤矿、地质、矿山地质、纺织、建筑、铁路、公路、水利等方面的三十七种专业。    （新华社）
