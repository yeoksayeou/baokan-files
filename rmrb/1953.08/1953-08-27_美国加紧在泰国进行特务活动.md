Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd, Washington Dispatch: The United States is stepping up its espionage and military activities in Thailand.

    Following the appointment of espionage chief William Donovan as the U.S. ambassador to Thailand, the U.S. government has also appointed Major General Gilmer, an "artillery and paratrooper expert," as military advisor to Thailand.
    According to a Reuters report citing "well-informed sources," Gilmer will serve as an advisor to the Thai army in paratrooper tactics and will conduct military activities on the border between Thailand and Laos because "these tactics may be valuable in the rugged terrain of most of the area bordering Thailand and Laos."
    According to the "Periscope" column in the August 17th issue of U.S. "Newsweek," "a large number of former U.S. intelligence agency Strategic Services operatives will follow the new Ambassador to Thailand, Donovan, to Thailand." The magazine also stated that these operatives were associated with Donovan when he served as the director of the Strategic Services during World War II.

    美国加紧在泰国进行特务活动
    【新华社二十二日讯】华盛顿消息：美国正在泰国加紧进行特务活动和军事活动。
    美国政府在任命特务头子威廉·杜诺万为驻泰国大使之后，又任命“炮兵和伞兵专家”吉尔摩少将为驻泰国军事顾问。
    据合众社引“消息灵通人士”谈话承认，吉尔摩将在伞兵战术方面充任泰国陆军的顾问；在泰国和寮国交界处进行军事活动。因为“在泰国和寮国交界的大部分崎岖不平的地区里，这种战术可能很有价值。”
    据八月十七日美国“新闻周刊”的“潜望镜栏”透露：“有一大批前美国情报机关战略服务处的特务分子将跟着新任驻泰大使杜诺万到泰国去。”该刊并说：当第二次世界大战时杜诺万担任战略服务处处长时，这批特务分子和他是有关系的。
