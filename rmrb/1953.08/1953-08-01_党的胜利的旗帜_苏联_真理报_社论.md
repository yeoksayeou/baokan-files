    The Party's Banner of Victory
    ——Editorial of the Soviet "Pravda"
    Fifty years ago—on July 30, 1903, the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party opened. The Second Congress, in the history of our country and the history of the entire international revolutionary movement, was a congress that laid the foundation for the fighting, revolutionary Marxist party of the working class—the heroic Bolshevik Party. The congress marked the victory of Lenin's brilliant plan to establish a proletarian party in Russia, a new type of party that was fundamentally different from the various reformist parties of the Second International. The Communist Party of our country, founded by the great Lenin, has traversed a glorious path of half a century of heroic struggle, arduous tests, and victories of world-historical significance. Now, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the most powerful and prestigious party in the world, an example for all fraternal communist and workers' parties, and the vanguard of the international communist movement. The working people of all countries regard it as the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our time. Unlike those bourgeois parties that have no future and are trapped in a quagmire with no way out, our party knows where to go and how to work, because our party is armed with the invincible theory of Marxism-Leninism, knowledge of the laws of social development and class struggle, and extremely rich experience in the revolutionary movement.

    When laying the foundation for the Marxist party in Russia, Lenin pointed out its world-historical mission: it is the party of social revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, the party that destroys capitalism and builds communism. Lenin wrote: "...As long as we organize the revolutionaries, we can overthrow Russia!" The prophecy of the great Lenin has been realized! The Communist Party united all the forces of the most revolutionary Russian proletariat in the world, drove all the vital and upright forces, awakened and mobilized the entire Russian people into the struggle, and united them around its banner—the invincible banner of fighting for communism.

    U.I. Lenin, the great successor to the cause and doctrine of Marx and Engels, expounded for the first time in the history of Marxism the theory of the party, explaining that the party is the leading organization of the proletariat, the basic weapon in the hands of the proletariat, without which it is impossible to obtain the dictatorship of the proletariat and to build socialism and communism.

    Our party was born on the solid theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism. Since its establishment, it has carried out such transformation work, which is unparalleled in terms of the richness of experience and the influencing power of social development. Through the fire and storms of three revolutions, our party finally overthrew the regime of capitalists and landlords in October 1917, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, dealt a fatal blow to world imperialism, saved our country from national disaster, and led the Soviet people onto the broad road of socialist transformation unprecedented in history. In the course of the revolutionary struggle, the Communist Party crushed the anti-people parties of the Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries, and anarchists, and eliminated the despicable Trotsky-Zinoviev capitulators and other revolutionary traitors who attempted to lead the party away from the Leninist line. Thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party and its Central Committee, the people of our country have built socialism, won a world-historically significant victory in the Great Patriotic War, and launched large-scale construction work for the construction of a communist society. The 19th Congress of the Party summarized the victories and achievements of our country and pointed out that the main task of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at present is to build a communist society by gradually transitioning from socialism to communism; continuously improve the material and cultural level of society, educate members of society with the spirit of internationalism and the spirit of establishing fraternal relations with the working people of all countries, and strengthen the active defense of the Soviet motherland in every possible way to avoid enemy aggression.

    The policies formulated by the Party represent the fundamental interests of the Soviet people and meet the needs of improving the material life of Soviet society. The Party teaches us to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, tirelessly strengthen the Soviet state—the main weapon for the struggle for communism, develop the socialist industry in every possible way—the strong and solid fortress of the Soviet state, strengthen the collective farm system, and make all collective farms achieve further upsurge and prosperity.

    In terms of domestic policy, the Party believes that one of its most important tasks is to continue to tirelessly care for the ever-increasing needs of the Soviet people. In terms of foreign relations, the Party will continue to unswervingly implement the policy of fighting for a consolidated and lasting international peace. The Party calls for vigorously strengthening the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship with the great Chinese people and the working people of all people's democratic countries, and protecting and strengthening the camp of peace, democracy and socialism.

    The strength and invincibility of our party lies in the unity and solidarity of its ranks, in the unity of will and action, and in the ability of party members to combine their will with the will and wishes of the party. The strength and invincibility of our party lies in its inseparable connection with the people. We must protect the unity of the party as we protect our eyes, further strengthen the inseparable connection between the party and the people, educate Communist Party members and all working people with the spirit of revolutionary criticism and self-criticism, with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, and with the spirit of irreconcilable and resolute struggle against enemies at home and abroad and against the conspiracies of the surrounding capitalist countries. The entire history of our party is the practice of Marxism-Leninism. The Party has achieved victories in the past and present because of its loyalty to Leninism. The Party requires members to understand the creative nature of Marxism-Leninism, not to play with individual formulas and quotations, but to grasp the true essence of the invincible Marxist-Leninist doctrine of improving the world.

    The 50th anniversary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a day of great significance for all our people and for the international revolutionary movement. As our party enters the sixth decade of its founding, it raises the victorious banner of communism even higher. Under the leadership of the talented Lenin, the successor to Lenin's cause, the great Stalin, and their comrades-in-arms, our Communist Party has been tempered in battle and is now the leading, leading, and guiding force of Soviet society, which is building communism. The Party bravely looks to the future, confident that its great cause will be completely victorious. The banner of our party, full of glorious battles and many historical victories, is raised high, calling on the people to move forward towards the victory of communism!

    Long live the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union!
    Under the banner of Leninism, under the leadership of the Communist Party, move forward towards the victory of communism!

    党的胜利的旗帜
    ——苏联“真理报”社论
    五十年前——一九○三年七月三十日，俄国社会民主工党第二次代表大会开幕了。第二次代表大会在我国历史上和整个国际革命运动史上，是奠定了工人阶级战斗的、革命的马克思主义政党——英雄的布尔什维克党的基础的一次代表大会。代表大会标志着列宁在俄国建立无产阶级政党、即建立与第二国际各种改良主义政党有原则区别的新型政党这一天才计划的胜利。伟大的列宁所创建的我国共产党，经历了半世纪英勇斗争、艰苦考验和具有全世界历史意义的胜利的光荣道路。现在苏联共产党是世界上最强大和最有威信的党，是各兄弟共产党和工人党的榜样，是国际共产主义运动的先锋队。各国的劳动人民把它看成是我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心。我们的党和那些没有前途的、陷在泥坑找不到出路的资产阶级政党不同，我们的党知道走向哪里和怎样进行工作，因为我们的党是以战无不胜的马克思—列宁主义的理论、社会发展规律的知识和阶级斗争的知识、极其丰富的革命运动的经验武装起来的。
    列宁在奠定俄国马克思主义政党时，就指出它的具有世界历史意义的使命：它是社会革命和无产阶级专政的党，是摧毁资本主义、建设共产主义的党。列宁写道：“……只要我们把革命者组织起来，我们就能推翻俄国！”伟大列宁的预言实现了！共产党团结了世界上最革命的俄国无产阶级的一切力量，带动了一切富于生气的和正直的势力，唤醒并发动了全体俄国人民投入斗争，把它们团结在自己的旗帜——为共产主义而斗争的战无不胜的旗帜的周围。
    马克思和恩格斯事业和学说的伟大继承者乌·伊·列宁，在马克思主义历史中第一次阐明了关于党的学说，说明党是无产阶级的领导组织，是无产阶级手中的基本武器，没有这个武器，就不能取得无产阶级专政，就不能建设社会主义和共产主义。
    我们的党是在马克思主义列宁主义的坚实的理论基础上产生的，它从成立以来进行了这样的改造工作，这种改造工作就其经验的丰富和社会发展的影响力量来说，都是举世无双的。我们的党通过三次革命的烈火和风暴，终于在一九一七年十月推翻了资本家和地主的政权，建立了无产阶级专政，对世界帝国主义给予了致命的打击，把我们国家从民族浩劫中拯救了出来，引导苏联人民走上了历史上前所未有的社会主义改造的康庄大道。共产党在革命斗争的过程中，粉碎了孟什维克、社会革命党人、无政府主义者这些反人民的党派，清除了可鄙的托洛茨基—季诺维也夫投降分子，以及企图使党离开列宁路线的其他革命叛徒。由于共产党、党的中央委员会英明的领导，我国人民建成了社会主义，在伟大卫国战争中获得了具有世界历史意义的胜利，并大规模地展开了为建设共产主义社会而进行的建设工作。党的第十九次代表大会总结了我们国家的胜利和成就，并指出：目前苏联共产党主要的任务是，通过由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的办法来建成共产主义社会；不断提高社会的物质和文化的水平，用国际主义的精神和跟各国劳动人民建立兄弟联系的精神教育社会成员，多方加强苏维埃祖国的积极防御，以免遭受敌人的侵略。
    党所制定的政策代表了苏联人民的根本利益，符合苏维埃社会物质生活提高的需要。党教导我们巩固工农联盟，不倦地加强苏维埃国家——为共产主义而斗争的主要武器，多方发展社会主义工业——苏维埃国家壮大和坚固的堡垒，加强集体农庄制度，使所有集体农庄获得进一步的高涨和繁荣。
    在国内政策方面，党认为它的最重要的任务之一是，今后不倦地关怀最大限度地满足苏联人的不断增长的需求。在对外关系方面，党今后要坚持不渝地执行为巩固的持久的国际和平而斗争的政策。党号召竭力加强跟伟大的中国人民、跟一切人民民主国家劳动者的永恒的牢不可破的兄弟友谊，保护并加强和平、民主和社会主义阵营。
    我们党的力量和不可战胜性在于它的队伍的团结
    一致，在于意志和行动的一致，在于党员善于把他们的意志跟党的意志和愿望结合起来。我们党的力量和不可战胜性在于它跟人民有不可分割的联系。我们要像保护眼珠一样，保护党的团结一致，进一步加强党跟人民的不可分割的联系，以革命的批评和自我批评精神，以高度的革命警惕性的精神教育共产党员和全体劳动者，以对内外敌人和对周围资本主义国家的阴谋进行不调和的坚决的斗争的精神教育他们。我们党的整个历史是马克思主义列宁主义的实践。党过去和现在都是由于忠于列宁主义而取得胜利的。党要求党员领会马克思主义列宁主义的创造性质，而不要玩弄个别的公式和引语，而要掌握战无不胜的改进世界的马克思列宁学说的真正本质。
    苏联共产党五十周年纪念日，对于我们全体人民、对于国际革命运动都是意义重大的日子。我们的党在进入建党的第六个十年的时候，更高地举起胜利的共产主义旗帜。我们共产党在天才的列宁、列宁事业的继承者和他的学生伟大的斯大林以及他们的战友们的领导下，已在战斗中百炼成钢，党现在是正在建设共产主义的苏维埃社会的主导的、领导的和指导的力量。党勇敢地瞻望着未来，深信它的伟大的事业定将完全胜利。我党的充满辉煌战斗和许许多多历史性胜利的旗帜高高地打起来了，它号召人民前进，走向共产主义的胜利！
    光荣的苏联共产党万岁！
    在列宁主义的旗帜下，在共产党的领导下，前进，走向共产主义的胜利！
