    Capturing "Live Intelligence"
    Chen Zihui
    This is a story that took place in a certain area on the Korean front before the armistice.
    A certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers arrived at a new position and urgently needed to understand the enemy's situation.
    Soon, Staff Officer Jiang and the village's Labor Party secretary contacted the Yingzui Peak guerrilla team, who were active behind enemy lines. The guerrilla leader readily agreed: they would deliver the intelligence the next day.
    The next day, the intelligence was indeed delivered, and it was "live intelligence"—a First Lieutenant of the ROK army in full American gear. Escorting him were three armed Korean girls.
    The taller girl, holding a Mosin-Nagant rifle, was the team leader, Quan Zongyu. The girl with short, boyish hair and black riding boots, who looked like Zoya, was called Cui Ying. Her left arm was injured, and she had it in a sling around her neck. The youngest, always smiling, with two shiny black braids hanging over her shoulders, was called Jin Yuanni. Jin Yuanni constantly wiped the DP-27 machine gun with the corner of her skirt. At everyone's request, they told the story of capturing this "live intelligence."
    That day at noon, the guerrilla leader assigned the task to the Quan Zongyu team, saying, "Brave girls, this mission is very important: our loved ones—the Volunteer Army comrades—are expecting your victory. Go!" They excitedly accepted the task and set off.
    On a protruding part of the ROK army's eastern front, there was a military post guarded by a platoon of ROK soldiers. They had run out of supplies, were starving and cursing, and were just waiting for a shift change. A ROK army First Lieutenant walked around, tightening his belt and looking around. At this moment, the sun was setting, and a melodious mountain song suddenly came from the foot of the mountain:
    "…Please let me lie under your eaves for a night,
    Girl, the wolves are howling, the night is deep.
    I am not a robber, but a wandering soul in misery…"
    In these days of fear and trepidation, this ROK army officer heard such a beautiful mountain song for the first time, but he immediately became frightened again, raised his gun, and shouted down the mountain:
    "Who's there? Running around in a military zone?"
    "We're delivering food," a girl's pleasant voice replied from below, "the township government asked us to deliver food!"
    The ROK army officer was not reassured and shone a flashlight down, seeing three girls with two rice baskets and a wine jar on their heads. He hesitated, thinking, "What's to be afraid of from three young girls! Let me have a good meal and drink! You won't be going back tonight!" His eyes flashed with fierce light like a hungry wolf, and he came down to meet them.
    "Hard work, girls!…" Before he could finish speaking, Quan Zongyu had already approached him.
    "You're welcome!" Quan Zongyu said, suddenly overturning the large rice basket, trapping the fellow's head. The fellow fired a shot in desperation, but missed Quan Zongyu; Quan Zongyu took advantage of his unpreparedness, snatched his pistol, and pushed hard, and the rice basket and the fellow rolled down the hillside together. Jin Yuanni was already waiting below, rushing forward to hold him down and tie up the ROK army officer who had been knocked senseless.
    The ROK soldiers heard the gunshot and immediately panicked. Cui Ying lit the fuse on the wine jar and pushed it towards the enemy. An ROK soldier saw the smoke coming from the jar and knew it was explosives, so he pushed it back. Quan Zongyu became enraged and charged forward with a bayonet, knocking the fellow over. At this most critical moment, Cui Ying quickly raised the jar, suddenly felt a prick in her left arm, her legs weakened, and she could hardly stand. But she gritted her teeth, mustered all her strength, and smashed the jar towards the enemy.
    There was a loud bang, and she fell to the ground, knowing nothing. Quan Zongyu quickly stepped forward to take care of her. After a while, she woke up and saw that the enemy's trench had been destroyed, and more than a dozen enemy corpses were lying in disorder. This scene made her very happy. She snuggled into Quan Zongyu's arms and said, "Sister Quan, we have punished these traitors to our country!" Quan Zongyu said to Cui Ying, "We have to retreat quickly. Can your body hold out?"
    "The enemy is coming again!" Cui Ying didn't have time to answer Quan Zongyu's words and picked up her gun to deal with the enemy; but her left arm was no longer working, and a stinging pain made the sweat constantly drip from her forehead, and she realized that she had been injured. At this time, Quan Zongyu threw a grenade at the several enemies chasing after them and hurriedly carried Cui Ying down the mountain.
    Suddenly, a series of gunshots rang out, and a group of enemies fell. It turned out that Jin Yuanni, with one foot on the dead pig-like lieutenant, was providing fire cover for the two of them.
    The enemy's searchlights from all around were shining crosswise on this mountain. The American artillery in the rear, thinking that the mountain had been occupied by the Volunteer Army, desperately bombarded it, turning the mountain into a sea of fire.
    The brave Quan Zongyu team, in the flashing firelight, escorted the ROK army lieutenant through those familiar mountains, forests, and bushes, and quickly returned to the Yingzui Peak guerrilla team headquarters.
    The captain said, "Girls, since you caught this guy, we'll send you to the Volunteer Army comrades!"
    So, regardless of fatigue, they sent this "live intelligence" to the command post of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army.
    Soon after, this unit of the Volunteer Army fought a very successful annihilation battle. The soldiers all knew that this glorious victory was inseparable from the names of the three Korean girls of the Quan Zongyu team.

    捉“活情报”
    陈子辉
    这是发生在停战以前朝鲜前线某地的一个故事。
    志愿军某部来到了新阵地，很需要马上了解敌人的情况。
    很快，江参谋和村劳动党书记一道，就跟活跃在敌后的鹰嘴峰游击队联络上了。游击队长一口答应：第二天一定把情报送到。
    第二天，情报果然送到了，而且是“活情报”——一个浑身美式装备的李伪军少尉。押送他来的是三个武装的朝鲜姑娘。
    那位个子大一点的姑娘，拿着水连珠步枪的，就是组长全宗玉。留着像男孩子一样的短短的分发，穿着黑马靴活像卓娅的姑娘，叫崔瑛。她的左胳膊挂了彩，用手巾吊在脖子下面。年龄最轻，总是笑眯眯的，两根乌油油的辫子垂在肩头上的叫金元妮。金元妮不断地用裙角擦着轮盘枪。在大家请求下，她们就讲起这次捉“活情报”的故事。
    那天中午，游击队长向全宗玉小组交代了任务，他说：“勇敢的姑娘们，这次任务很重要：我们的亲人——志愿军同志们在期待着你们的胜利。去吧！”她们兴奋地接受了任务，就出发了。
    在李伪军阵地东线的一个突出部分上，设着一个军事哨，有一排伪军驻守着。他们的给养吃光了，饿得直骂街，只等着换班。一个伪军少尉勒紧了裤带走着，四下张望着。这时候，太阳落山了，山下忽然传来了悠扬的山歌声：
    “……请让我在你屋檐下躺一宿吧，
    女郎啊，狼在嚎，夜已深。
    我不是强盗，是个苦命的流浪人。……”    
    在这心惊胆战的日子里，这个伪军军官还是第一次听见这样好听的山歌，可是他马上又害怕起来了，提起枪，向山下大喊道：
    “干什么的？到军事区乱跑？”
    “送饭的，”山下是女孩子悦耳的回答声，“乡公所叫我们来送饭的！”
    伪军军官不放心，用电筒照过去，看见三个姑娘的头上，顶着两只饭箩和一个酒坛。他犹豫了一下，心想：“三个黄毛丫头，有啥可怕！让老子痛快吃喝一顿吧，今晚你们也别想回去！”他两眼像饿狼一样闪着凶恶的光，迎了下来。
    “辛苦啦，姑娘们！……”没等他说完，全宗玉已经逼近他面前。
    “别客气吧！”全宗玉一边说着，一边就突然翻过大饭箩，套住了那家伙的脑瓜，那家伙急得砰地打了一枪，可是没有打着全宗玉；全宗玉乘着他措手不及的时候一把夺下他的手枪，顺手用力一推，饭箩和那家伙就一齐骨碌碌地顺着山坡滚下去了。下面早有金元妮等着，她上前一把把他按住，把跌得昏头昏脑的伪军军官捆绑起来。
    伪军士兵们听见枪响，马上乱了营。崔瑛把酒坛口上的导火索一拉，又顺手一推，酒坛一直向敌群滚去。一个伪军士兵见坛口冒烟，知道是炸药，又把它推了回来。全宗玉发怒了，冲上去就是一刺刀，把那家伙挑翻了。在这最危急的刹那间，崔瑛迅速地举起坛子，忽然觉得左胳膊被戳了一下，两腿一软，有些支持不住了。可是她还是咬着牙，鼓起全身力量，把坛子向敌群中猛砸过去。
    只听到一声巨响，她就倒在地上，什么也不知道了。全宗玉赶忙上前去照拂她。一会儿，她苏醒过来，看见敌人的交通沟已经被炸毁了，十多个敌人的尸体，横七竖八地躺着。这景象真叫她快活。她偎着全宗玉的胸脯说：“全姐姐，我们惩罚了这些祖国的叛徒！”全宗玉对崔瑛说：“我们得赶快撤。你的身体能坚持吧？”
    “敌人又来啦！”崔瑛没来得及回答全宗玉的话，就端起枪准备对付敌人；可是她的左臂已经不好使了，一阵刺心的疼痛，使她的汗珠不断从额上掉下来，她这才知道自己负了伤。这时候，全宗玉向追来的几个敌人扔了一颗手榴弹，赶忙背起崔瑛就往山下跑。
    忽然“突突突”地一连串的枪响，敌人倒了一片。这原来是金元妮一只脚踩着死猪样的少尉，在用火力掩护她俩。
    四周敌人的探照灯光，交叉着照在这山头上。后面美国鬼子的炮兵，以为这山头已被志愿军占领了，于是就拼命轰击，把山头打成一片火海。
    勇敢的全宗玉小组，在火光闪耀中，押着伪军少尉，穿过那些熟悉的山林、草丛，迅速地回到了鹰嘴峰游击队队部。
    队长说：“姑娘们，这家伙是你们抓到的，就派你们给志愿军同志们送去吧！”
    于是，她们就不顾疲劳，又把这个“活情报”送到志愿军某部指挥所来了。
    不久以后，志愿军的这支部队打了一次很出色的歼灭战。战士们都知道，这光辉的胜利，是和全宗玉小组三个朝鲜姑娘的名字分不开的。
