Reactions to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

Earnestly Value the Opinions of Fishermen

The "Reader's Letters Summary" column published two letters on July 13th reflecting problems in fishermen's production. Summaries of the relevant units' replies are published below:

Regarding the problem of "More than 40,000 fishermen in Linghu, Wuxing County, urgently request a sufficient supply of bait," the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Aquatic Products Bureau, has replied. The letter states: "Fishermen in Linghu need 26,000 dan of bean cake as fish feed this year. After our bureau contacted relevant units, the Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative Union allocated 25,100 dan of bean cake in mid-June and late June respectively. After the summer fish fry are released into the ponds, feeding begins in July; the bean cake already allocated is sufficient for fish farmers in the county to use until November. After September, new soybeans will be on the market, and bean cake can be supplied to the market. Therefore, the fish bait problem in the area has been resolved."

Regarding the problem of catching juvenile fish in Yangjialiangzi Fishery Farm, Fuyu, Jilin Province (the original letter mistakenly referred to Yangjia Fishery Farm, Fuyu County), the Central Ministry of Agriculture, Aquatic Products Management Bureau, takes this very seriously. Their letter states: "The work of breeding and protecting aquatic resources is very important for the development of fishery production. We have asked the local leading authorities to investigate and deal with the problem reflected by the readers." The Fuyu Fishery Farm in Jilin Province has also sent a letter to make a self-criticism on this issue. The letter states: "The small miscellaneous fish caught by the third operation team (Yangjialiangzi) of our farm accounted for 40% of the total fish catch last year, and about 500 jin of small carp that could grow into large fish were caught from March to June this year. This shows that our work in protecting the breeding of fish is not good enough. The readers' criticism has drawn our attention. We have now changed the close-meshed foil used in the past on the Liangzi to wide-seam foil with five-fen eyes, and installed a two-zhang-long, one-cun square-eyed large-eye seam on each Liangzi. At the same time, we have sent someone to give the staff of each operation team a detailed explanation of the important significance of fish breeding and protection work. In addition, we plan to further improve the specifications (enlarge the gaps) of the flow boxes and flow ponds (fishing tools) when releasing the Liangzi in winter, so as to do a better job in protecting the breeding of fish."

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    切实重视渔民群众的意见
    “读者来信摘要”栏在七月十三日刊载了反映渔民生产中的问题的两封来信。现将各有关单位的答复信摘要发表于后：
    关于“吴兴县菱湖四万多渔民迫切要求充分供应饵料”的问题，浙江省人民政府农林厅水产局已来信作了答复。来信说：“菱湖渔民今年需要用作养鱼饵料的豆饼二万六千担。经我局与各有关单位联系，在六月中旬与六月底，浙江省合作总社已先后拨去豆饼二万五千一百担。菱湖鱼种夏花下塘以后，到七月份开始投饵；已拨去的豆饼足可供该县养鱼户用至十一月。而到九月以后，新黄豆登场，豆饼又可出货应市。因此，该地鱼饵问题已经解决。”
    关于吉林省扶余渔场杨家梁子（原批评信误为扶余县杨家渔场）捕捞幼鱼的问题，中央农业部水产管理总局很为重视。他们来信说：“水产资源的繁殖保护工作，对发展渔业生产有很重要的关系。读者反映的问题，我们已让当地领导机关调查处理。”吉林省扶余渔场对这个问题也已来信作了检讨。信中说：“我场所属第三作业场（杨家梁子）去年全年所捕小杂鱼占捕鱼总量百分之四十，今年三月至六月又捕了能成长为大鱼的小鲫鱼五百斤左右。这说明我们对鱼类的繁殖保护工作做得不够，读者的批评，引起了我们的注意。我们现在已将过去梁子上使用的密眼箔改为五分眼的宽缝箔，并在各梁子上又安设了一块二丈长，一寸方眼的大眼缝。同时派专人向各作业场工作人员把鱼类繁殖保护工作的重要意义进行了一次详细的讲解。此外，我们计划在冬季放梁子时，进一步改进淌箱、淌囤（捕鱼工具）的规格（放大空隙），以便把鱼类的繁殖保护工作做得更好。”
