    North China Administrative Committee
    Issues Instructions on Autumn Wheat Planting Work
    The North China Administrative Committee issued instructions on August 26 regarding autumn wheat planting work. The instructions pointed out that with the development of national economic construction and the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for wheat will increase year by year. In order to gradually adapt to this increasing demand, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of increasing yield per unit area. The instructions require all localities to do a good job in improving wheat cultivation techniques and other work, in order to lay the foundation for increasing wheat production next year. First, efforts must be made to achieve full wheat emergence. Before sowing, the land must be carefully cultivated and harrowed, and the land must be well prepared, and basal fertilizer must be applied early to promote decomposition. During sowing, attention must be paid to sowing techniques to ensure that the seeds are evenly distributed, at appropriate depths, and poison bait must be used to kill underground pests, and efforts must be made to eliminate the phenomenon of broken rows and missing seedlings. Secondly, it is necessary to effectively prevent wheat from frost damage and educate the masses to pay attention to frost-resistant cultivation techniques. Apply more organic fertilizer as basal fertilizer before sowing to maintain soil temperature; ensure timely sowing and appropriate depth based on soil moisture and season; after sowing, implement ridge rolling to compact the soil and create a suitable environment for wheat to survive in winter. For irrigated wheat fields, attention should be paid to improving irrigation techniques, ensuring timely and appropriate irrigation, and correcting the phenomenon of blindly advocating winter irrigation and large-scale flooding regardless of region and climate conditions. Third, importance should be attached to promoting dense planting of wheat. State-owned mechanized farms and demonstration farms at the provincial, special, and county levels, in addition to using a small amount of land (two to three mu) for sowing according to the cultivation level and habits of local farmers, in order to demonstrate to farmers the comparison between sparse planting and dense planting, all wheat fields must implement dense planting. When promoting dense planting of wheat among farmers, the policy of steady progress should be implemented. Areas where dense planting has been successfully trialed should actively carry out example education on dense planting and increased production, and gradually promote it in a planned manner. Areas where dense planting has not yet been trialed should deeply publicize the principles of dense planting and increased production, carry out point demonstrations in a planned manner, and call on and guide farmers to conduct small-scale trials to create conditions for future promotion of dense planting. In addition, the instructions also require all localities to appropriately expand the wheat planting area in a planned manner according to possible conditions, and do a good job in adjusting wheat seeds and supplying means of production.

    华北行政委员会
    发出关于秋季种麦工作的指示
    华北行政委员会在二十六日发出关于秋季种麦工作的指示。指示指出：随着国家经济建设的发展，人民生活水平的提高，小麦需要量将逐年增大。为了逐步适应这种日益增长的需要，必须继续贯彻提高单位面积产量的方针。指示要求各地作好改进小麦栽培技术等工作，为明年小麦增产打下基础。首先要努力争取小麦全苗。在播种以前，必须精耕细耙，整好土地，并早施基肥，以促进腐熟，在播种中，必须讲究播种技术，使籽粒均匀，深浅适宜，并使用毒谷药杀地下害虫，大力争取消灭断垄缺苗现象。其次要切实防止小麦冻害，教育群众重视防冻栽培技术。播种前多施有机质肥料作基肥，保持地温；依据墒情和节令，保证播种及时和深度适宜；播种后实行压垄，严密土壤，为小麦冬季生存创造适宜的环境。对水浇麦田应注意改进浇水技术，作到浇水适时适量，纠正不分地区，不看气候条件，盲目提倡冬浇和大水漫浇的现象。第三要重视推广小麦密植工作。国营机耕农场和省、专、县各级示范农场，除以少数土地（二至三亩）按照当地农民耕作水平和习惯进行播种，以便用稀植与密植的对比结果向农民示范外，所有麦田都须实行密植。在农民中推广小麦密植时，应贯彻稳步前进的方针。试行密植已成功的地区应积极进行密植增产的实例教育，有计划地逐步推广。尚未试行密植的地区应深入宣传密植增产的道理，有计划地进行布点示范，并号召与指导农民进行小块试验，为今后推广密植创造条件。此外，指示还要求各地根据可能条件有计划地适当扩大小麦播种面积，并作好麦种的调剂和生产资料的供应工作。
