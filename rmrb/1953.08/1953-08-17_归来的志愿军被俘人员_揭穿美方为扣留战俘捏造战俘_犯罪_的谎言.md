(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 16) Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war (POWs) who returned from the American POW camp in Busan exposed the absurd lies fabricated by the American side regarding so-called POW "crimes" to forcibly detain our POWs.

According to Tao Qingshan, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army POW, a POW named Yang Zuoheng traveled with him from Busan to Munsan during this repatriation. However, after arriving in Munsan, Yang Zuoheng was arrested by the Americans. Tao Qingshan and Yang Zuoheng lived together in the Busan detention camp for a long time. Tao Qingshan said, "When we met with representatives of the Chinese Red Cross on the train in Busan, Yang Zuoheng ran over and shook hands with them. That was the reason for his arrest. I have never seen him commit any crimes."

Another returnee, Hu Ruiting, said that at around 3:00 PM on August 8th, when our POWs in the 7th Busan detention camp, who insisted on repatriation, were lined up to depart, the American side suddenly pulled two of our POWs, Bai Yucai and another, from the ranks. Both of them had received numbered badges for repatriation, but the American side did not give any reason for detaining them.

According to POWs returning from the 7th Busan detention camp, before leaving Busan, they received a letter jointly signed by thirty seriously wounded and sick Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs. From this letter, they learned that the American side continued to deprive our sick and wounded POWs of their right to be quickly repatriated.

Xu Zhengxiang, a POW returning from the same detention camp, once again confirmed that Wu Chengde, an officer of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and another POW were imprisoned in a small wire-mesh enclosure only six or seven meters away from the 7th detention camp. Xu Zhengxiang even greeted Wu Chengde when he left the detention camp. According to Xu Zhengxiang, on the night of July 27th, Kuomintang secret agents Hu Zhengming, Wang Qian, and others in the detention camp gave Xu Zhengxiang an iron bar and a rope, forcing him to strangle Wu Chengde. However, Xu Zhengxiang refused. Xu Zhengxiang said that the American side was condoning Kuomintang secret agents to murder detained Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs who insisted on repatriation. Xu Zhengxiang said that on June 28th, Kuomintang secret agents Hu Zhengming, Wang Qian, and others beat Wang Kang, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army POW, all over his body with wooden sticks, strangled him with a rope, and then hung his body on the roof beam, deceiving our POWs by saying, "Wang Kang was afraid of returning to the mainland and committed suicide!" On the same day, secret agent Hu Zhengming also strangled Yang Jiepu, a Chinese People's Volunteer Army POW who insisted on repatriation. Another Chinese People's Volunteer Army POW surnamed Zhou was also beaten to death with wooden sticks by the secret agents. (Attached pictures)

    归来的志愿军被俘人员
    揭穿美方为扣留战俘捏造战俘“犯罪”的谎言
    【新华社开城十六日电】从美方釜山战俘营中归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，揭穿了美方为强迫扣留我方被俘人员而捏造的所谓战俘“犯罪”的无稽谎言。
    据中国人民志愿军被俘人员陶青山说，在这次遣返途中，有一个被俘人员杨作恒同他一道从釜山到了汶山。可是，到了汶山以后，杨作恒却被美方抓走了。陶青山和杨作恒长期同住在釜山收容所里。陶青山说：“当我们在釜山火车上和中国红十字会代表会面时，杨作恒跑去和代表们握了手。这就是他被捕的原因。我从来没有见过他有什么犯罪行为。”
    另一名归来人员胡瑞庭说：八月八日下午三点钟左右，当釜山第七收容所中坚持遣返的我方被俘人员列队出发时，美方突然把我方被俘人员白玉才等两人从队伍中拉了出去。他们两个人都已领到了列入遣返的编号牌证，但美方却没有说明任何理由就把他们扣留了。
    据从釜山第七收容所归来的被俘人员说，他们在离开釜山前，曾收到三十个重伤重病的中国人民志愿军被俘人员共同签名的一封信。从这封信中，他们知道美方继续在剥夺我方病伤被俘人员应被迅速遣返的权利。
    从同一个收容所归来的被俘人员徐正祥，再一次证实中国人民志愿军的军官吴成德和另一名被俘人员被关禁在距第七收容所不过六、七公尺远的一个小铁丝网围场里。徐正祥在离开收容所时，还曾和吴成德打了招呼。据徐正祥说，在七月二十七日深夜，收容所中的国民党特务胡正明、王谦等曾交给徐正祥一条铁棍和一根绳子，强迫他去勒死吴成德。但是徐正祥拒绝了。徐正祥说：美方正在放纵国民党特务谋杀被扣留的坚持遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。徐正祥说：六月二十八日，国民党特务胡正明、王谦等用木棒把中国人民志愿军被俘人员王康打得浑身青肿，再用绳子勒死，然后将尸首挂到屋梁上，欺骗我方被俘人员说：“王康害怕回大陆，自杀了！”同一天，特务胡正明又把一个坚持遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员杨介甫勒死。还有一个姓周的中国人民志愿军被俘人员也被特务们用木棒打死。（附图片）
