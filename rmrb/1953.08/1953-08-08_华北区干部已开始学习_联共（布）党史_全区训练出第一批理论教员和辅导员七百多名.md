The preparatory work for the theoretical study of economic construction in the North China Region and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been basically completed, and studies began in mid-July.

In order to implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CCP) on the theoretical education of cadres in 1953-1954 and to smoothly carry out the study of economic construction theory, the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee began to hold a research class on economic construction issues in early February this year, and the second phase is about to graduate. The two phases have trained a total of 124 in-service cadres at the prefectural committee level and above, to serve as theoretical teachers in intermediate groups and study backbones in advanced groups. The Propaganda Department also summarized the learning experience of the research class to guide the work of the theoretical teacher and counselor training classes in various provinces and cities. At the end of April, a symposium of the heads of theoretical education sections of the propaganda departments of the provincial and municipal party committees was held to study the various preparatory tasks for the study. After the meeting, various places actively began preparations. At present, the North China region has trained the first batch of 771 theoretical teachers and counselors for intermediate and primary groups. The Hebei and Shanxi Provincial Committees, and the Beijing and Tianjin Municipal Committees of the CCP held training classes for theoretical teachers and counselors for economic construction theory from late May to early June. Hebei trained 394 people, Shanxi trained 68 people, and plans to continue with a second phase. Beijing trained 128 people, and Tianjin trained 57 people. In addition, the Shanxi Provincial Committee stipulated that the provincial and municipal party schools should regard the training of theoretical teachers and counselors for intermediate and primary groups as their regular and important task in the future, and require the provincial party school to conduct two phases of intensive training for 200 primary group teachers and counselors from September this year to January next year; the Taiyuan and Datong municipal party committees are required to run one or two phases of training classes for primary group teachers and counselors in August and September this year. The first batch of theoretical teacher and counselor training work in the North China region was mostly completed at the end of July. During the training, the students were enthusiastic and basically achieved the expected results. Through the study, the students enriched their theoretical knowledge of economic construction, clarified the main issues in Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," increased their interest in studying theory and their confidence in becoming theoretical teachers, and further strengthened their concept of learning from the Soviet Union. This group of trained theoretical education teams will be an important force for the smooth development of theoretical study of economic construction in the North China region. They will soon go to various places and, under the direct leadership of party committees at all levels, will lead the vast number of cadres participating in theoretical study in the region to create a upsurge in theoretical study of economic construction.

In order to strengthen the ideological leadership and theoretical guidance of in-service cadres' theoretical study and to deepen the learning effect, the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau, the Hebei Provincial Committee, and the Beijing Municipal Committee Propaganda Department have all prepared to establish study rooms. The Shanxi Provincial Committee and the Tianjin Municipal Committee have also made decisions on establishing study rooms and full-time theoretical teachers. In order to provide learning materials to various places in a timely manner, the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau has compiled study outlines. In the future, it will focus on exchanging learning experiences and insights from various places, answering difficult questions in learning, continuing to provide learning materials, and preparing an irregular study publication. The Shanxi and Hebei Provincial Committees are preparing to publish publications to guide learning, exchange learning experiences, and plan to hold theoretical radio lectures. In order to enable the advanced group's study to promote the theoretical study of all cadres, the Hebei Provincial Committee and the Beijing Municipal Committee started the advanced group in advance in May and June. Under the leadership of their respective party committees, each advanced group studied the instructions of the Central Committee on the theoretical education of cadres before studying, so that everyone further recognized the great significance of this study. The early study of the advanced group will greatly help guide the theoretical study of the intermediate and primary groups.

In addition, various places have carried out the work of consolidating study groups and organizations while training teachers and counselors. In addition to continuing to consolidate the established spare-time theoretical schools in seven special zones of five cities in Hebei, the directly affiliated organs of the province are trying to establish two branch schools, and other prefectural and municipal committees have also made plans to establish theoretical schools. The Shanxi Provincial Committee plans to try out spare-time theoretical schools in the directly affiliated organs of the province and in Taiyuan and Datong, and gradually promote them after gaining experience. The Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee is summarizing the study of the history of the CCP and studying the future organizational forms and leadership methods of the study, and has put forward improvement plans for theoretical schools, part-time teachers, and the training of counselors. The Party Committee of the directly affiliated organs of the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee also made a plan to implement the central instructions, and convened a joint meeting of propaganda committee members of the general branches and branches on June 24 to make arrangements, determining that from July 1 to 15, they would first read Chapters 7 and 8 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" and study the central instructions on the theoretical education of cadres in 1953-1954 and the People's Daily editorial on April 25. From July 16, they officially began the study of Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," and emphasized the need to strengthen study guidance, stipulating that all comrades participating in the advanced group study have the responsibility to guide the intermediate and primary groups. Each general branch and branch should hire fixed counselors, specifically determine the counseling objects, and ask the teachers who give lectures on each chapter to convene counselor meetings according to plan, organize discussions on the central issues of each chapter, assist counselors in their counseling work, and effectively correct the past tendency of counseling work being perfunctory.

The theoretical study of cadres in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also begun. In order to implement the central instructions, the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee's Mengsui Sub-bureau transferred 52 county-level cadres and jointly ran a research class on economic construction issues with the sub-bureau's party school to train intermediate group counselors and primary group teachers. The CCP Inner Mongolia Eastern District Committee also selected a total of 63 cadres at the division and section chief level from the directly affiliated organs of the Eastern District and opened a research class on economic construction theory, adopting the method of on-the-job study to train intermediate group theoretical study counselors. At the same time, a training class on economic construction knowledge was held to train 55 primary group teachers and counselors. These research classes and training classes were all equipped with full-time teachers or invited special lecturers. A total of 170 intermediate and primary theoretical teachers and counselors were trained in the Inner Mongolia region. In order to strengthen the regular leadership of the study, the CCP Central Committee's Mengsui Sub-bureau made a decision on establishing study rooms and full-time theoretical teachers, and prepared to publish publications to guide the study and hold theoretical radio lectures to exchange learning experiences and strengthen specific guidance on the study.
