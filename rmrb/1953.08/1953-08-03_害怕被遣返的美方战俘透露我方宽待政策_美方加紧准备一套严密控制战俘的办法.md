Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 2nd – As the repatriation of prisoners of war (POWs) is about to begin on the 5th, the U.S. military authorities, in order to facilitate the creation of myths about the mistreatment of POWs by the Korean and Chinese side and to prevent the repatriated POWs from revealing the true situation of the lenient treatment of POWs by the Korean and Chinese side, are stepping up preparations for a strict method of controlling POWs.

According to the Associated Press, the U.S. method stipulates that after the POWs are repatriated, they will be subjected to strict scrutiny. Any POWs who may reveal the lenient treatment by the Korean and Chinese side, or who have views unfavorable to the U.S. aggressive policies in Korea, will not be allowed to talk to reporters. Even those POWs who have been approved by the U.S. authorities to talk to reporters will be subject to "close supervision" by military inspectors. Military inspectors will "prohibit them from revealing all their experiences in the communist POW camps." Even so, the U.S. military authorities are still not at ease, and have painstakingly stipulated ten so-called "special questions" that POWs are prohibited from discussing. The U.S. side dares not announce the content of these "special questions," and forbids reporters from revealing the content of these questions, the extent to which they are unpresentable can be imagined. The U.S. military authorities also stipulated that when POWs violate these prohibitions during conversations, military inspectors will immediately prohibit the POWs from continuing to talk to reporters. The U.S. military authorities apparently feel that this is still not foolproof, so the repatriated POWs "must also sign certain documents, guaranteeing that they understand this inspection regulation." These documents, signed under duress, "still have a binding effect even when the POWs return home and talk to reporters outside the scope of military inspection." That is to say, POWs will always be prohibited from talking about the good treatment they received in the Korean and Chinese POW camps. According to the Associated Press, the U.S. method applies to POWs of the United Nations forces, that is, including POWs from Britain and other vassal states.

The reason why the U.S. military authorities want to so strictly control the POWs' conversations, according to the Associated Press, is because they are afraid that they will talk about "problems that reflect the behavior of the captured personnel of the United Nations forces, or reveal news that may become good material for communist propaganda." This reminds people of the despicable acts of the U.S. in fabricating lies during the repatriation of sick and wounded POWs in April and May of this year. At that time, after the U.S. sick and wounded POWs were repatriated, the U.S. military authorities painstakingly tried to prevent them from revealing the truth. At the same time, they used the U.S. propaganda machine to spread rumors and create ghost stories about the "mistreatment" of POWs by the Korean and Chinese side. However, the repatriated POWs from the United States, Britain, and other countries still admitted that the treatment they received in the Korean and Chinese POW camps was humanitarian, which made the U.S. conspiracy suffer a shameful bankruptcy and was criticized by world opinion. The U.S. is now racking its brains to come up with more stringent methods to control POWs, attempting to replay the old conspiracy with new tricks, in order to eliminate the good influence of the humanitarian policy of the Korean and Chinese side in treating POWs leniently among the American people and soldiers. But the facts are all there, and the U.S. conspiracy is doomed to failure.

### 害怕被遣返的美方战俘透露我方宽待政策  美方加紧准备一套严密控制战俘的办法

    害怕被遣返的美方战俘透露我方宽待政策
    美方加紧准备一套严密控制战俘的办法
    【新华社开城二日电】双方战俘即将在五日开始遣返，美方军事当局为了便于制造关于朝中方面虐待战俘的神话，使被遣返的战俘不能透露朝中方面宽待战俘的真实情况，正在加紧准备一套严密控制战俘的办法。
    据合众社透露，美方这套办法规定，战俘被遣返后，就要受到严格的审查。凡是可能透露朝中方面的宽大待遇，和对美国在朝鲜一切作为有不利于侵略政策的看法的战俘，都不准与记者谈话。就是得到美方当局准许的战俘，在与记者谈话时，也将受到军事检查员的“严密监视”。军事检查员将“禁止他们透露他们在共方战俘营的所有经历”。虽然如此，美军当局仍不放心，还费尽心机规定了十种所谓“特殊的问题”，禁止战俘谈论。这些“特殊的问题”的内容，美方不敢宣布，而且禁止记者透露这些问题的内容，其见不得人的程度可想而知。美军当局还规定，当战俘在谈话时违犯了这些禁令时，军事检查员将立即禁止战俘继续与记者谈话。美军当局显然觉得这样还不能保险，因此，被遣返的战俘“还必须在某些文件上签字，保证他们了解这种检查条例”。这些强迫签署的文件，“即使在战俘回到家里与在军事检查范围以外的记者谈话时，还是有约束作用的。”这就是说，战俘将一直要被禁止谈论他们在朝中战俘营内所受到的良好待遇。据合众社报道，美方的这套办法是适用于联合国军战俘的，也就是说，包括英国和其他仆从国家的战俘在内。
    美方军事当局所以要如此严密地控制战俘的谈话，据合众社说，这是因为害怕他们谈出“足以反映联军被俘人员的行为的问题，或透露可能成为共产党宣传的好材料的消息”。这使人回忆起今年四、五月间遣返病伤战俘时美方捏造谎言的卑鄙勾当。当时，美方的病伤战俘被遣返后，美军当局曾经煞费苦心，不让他们透露事实的真相，同时，通过美国宣传机器大肆造谣，制造关于朝中方面“虐待”战俘的鬼话。但是被遣返的美英等国战俘仍旧承认他们在朝中战俘营中所受到的待遇是合乎人道主义的，使美方的这个阴谋遭到了可耻的破产，而且受到了世界舆论的指责。美方现在又挖空心思，想出更严密的办法来控制战俘，企图重演旧阴谋的新花样，来消除朝中方面宽待战俘的人道主义政策在美国人民和士兵中间所引起的良好影响。但是事实俱在，美方的这个阴谋是注定要失败的。
