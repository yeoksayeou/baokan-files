As early as the spring of 1950, Dulles confessed in his book "War or Peace": "If in the near future, the crisis of war seems to have passed, that will be the time of the greatest crisis, in that way, we will be tempted to relax, become negligent, and disarm ourselves." The Korean armistice, needless to say, will deprive Wall Street's monopoly capitalists of an opportunity to take advantage of the chaos and reap huge profits from the bloodbath of war. Therefore, Dulles, who has been loyal to serving Wall Street all his life, just as he rushed to Korea three years ago to personally ignite the flames of war, has rushed to Korea again as the flames of the Korean war have just been extinguished, to plot a new conspiracy with Syngman Rhee, who clamors for "going it alone."

Dulles's life activities are inseparable from Wall Street. From the time he became a lawyer at the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm in 1911, he became a loyal servant of Wall Street. Through this "most wealthy and powerful New York law firm," Dulles established close relationships with American financial magnates Morgan and Rockefeller's Standard Oil, Chase Bank, U.S. Steel and other large companies. At the same time, he was also a director of International Nickel Company and a director of important financial institutions and enterprises of Wall Street such as American Banknote Company, American Agricultural Chemical Company, New York Bank, and Fifth Avenue Bank of New York.

All the activities of Dulles and his law firm were concentrated on instigating international military adventures to seek bloody profits for Wall Street. Morgan's U.S. Steel Corporation and Anaconda Copper Company, Rockefeller's Standard Oil, DuPont's chemical trust, Mellon's aluminum company and other huge financial institutions and enterprises all concluded various cartel contracts with international fascist financial groups through Dulles's law firm; international fascist consortia also hired Dulles's law firm as their legal counsel. Now the archives of Dulles's law firm still preserve the documents with the odious names of fascist clients such as Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, and Laval. Dulles has always had a close relationship with Hitler, and this relationship has never been interrupted for twenty years from 1920 to 1940. An American senator once revealed this point, saying: "One of Mr. Dulles's relationships is his dealings with the banking circles that rescued Hitler... and established Hitler's Nazi Party." In 1932, Dulles represented American investors and attended the international debt conference convened by German fascist financial magnate Schacht three times in a row. Later, Dulles, as legal counsel to the German fascist trust IG Farben and the German fascist financial group Schroeder Bank, obtained $2 billion in investments from American financial magnates for German fascist financial magnates as capital for preparing for aggressive wars.

Dulles and the Chinese reactionaries have an ancestral relationship. As early as 1895, when the Manchu government was defeated by Japan and negotiated peace, his grandfather, old Dulles, went to China to serve as an advisor to the Manchu government's peace delegation. It was under the "advisorship" of old Dulles that the Manchu government formally ceded Taiwan to Japan. When the Manchu government participated in the Hague Conference in 1907, it was forced to hire two Americans as "Chinese representatives," one of whom was old Dulles, and this time he also brought his nineteen-year-old grandson, young Dulles, and let him serve as the secretary of the Manchu government delegation. At that time, old Dulles sarcastically said: when the real Chinese representatives protested against the armed invasion of their homeland, all they got was a burst of laughter. Dulles's nature of invading others and hating oppressed nations was cultivated in this way.

The intricate relationship between Dulles and Wall Street has made him a favorite in American diplomatic circles. Since he was appointed as an advisor to the American delegation to the San Francisco Conference in 1945, he has been indispensable in the international conferences in which the United States has participated. Wall Street regards this loyal servant of theirs as a permanent representative in the American delegations to the successive sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. In the United Nations General Assembly, one can often hear his slander against the Soviet Union and China, his opposition to disarmament, his opposition to the prohibition of atomic weapons, and his opposition to the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers, and one can see him constantly twitching his nervous right eye, shouting loudly: "We do not want to excessively respect the Yalta Agreement and the Potsdam Declaration." In 1948, when the United States and Britain discussed the content of the Pacific Pact military alliance, Dulles was an active planner and instigator. In September 1951, he single-handedly arranged the signing of the separate peace treaty with Japan and the so-called "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty."

The American press calls Dulles the "Secretary of Cold War," which is very appropriate. As early as 1945, Dulles clamored at a meeting of the American Manufacturers Association: the United States should assume "the moral responsibility of leading the world." In February 1947, Dulles continued to advocate that the United States should establish a dominant position in the world when he spoke in Chicago. After the Paris Conference in the spring of 1949, Dulles warned the American people that they should "artificially maintain a state of tension." He also issued a strange theory against the prohibition of atomic weapons in "War or Peace," saying: "If weapons of mass slaughter can really be destroyed, we will all naturally feel relieved. But this is not 'peace.' This only means that we will die a little later, not a little earlier, perhaps we can say that we will die slowly, not quickly." In January of this year, when Dulles climbed to the high position of Secretary of State, he became even more arrogant. His anti-Soviet and anti-communist speech on January 27 was a well-known and extremely arrogant manifestation.

However, everyone knows that Dulles is not only the "Secretary of Cold War" of the U.S. government, but also the pioneer of "hot war." In June 1950, he personally ran to the 38th parallel in Korea to deploy Syngman Rhee's troops to launch an offensive, which is a well-known example.

The flames of war in Korea were finally extinguished by the powerful Chinese and Korean people. Dulles's beautiful dream was finally shattered. However, the aggressors are not willing to fail. Therefore, Dulles hurried to Korea again to conspire with Syngman Rhee to undermine the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The Chinese and Korean people and the people all over the world who oppose war are redoubling their vigilance and preparing to give any new conspiracies of the warmongers a head-on blow at any time.

    杜勒斯的嘴脸
    金之光
    早在一九五○年春天，杜勒斯就在他的“战争乎，和平乎”一书中坦白地说过：“假如在最近的将来，战争的危机好像是过去了，那便是最大危机的时候，那样，我们就会被引诱而松懈起来，疏忽起来，解除了我们的武装。”目前朝鲜的停火，不用说，将使华尔街独占资本家失去一个趁火打劫，从战争的血泊中捞取高额利润的机会。因此，一生忠诚为华尔街服务的杜勒斯，正像三年前他匆匆跑到朝鲜去亲手点燃起战火一样，在朝鲜的战火刚刚停熄的时候，他又匆匆地跑到朝鲜，和叫嚣着“单独干”的李承晚一起去策划一个新的阴谋了。
    杜勒斯一生的活动是和华尔街分不开的。从一九一一年到苏里文与克朗威尔律师事务所当律师起，他就成了华尔街的忠实奴仆，杜勒斯通过这个“纽约律师事务所中最富有和势力最雄厚的”律师事务所，与美国财阀摩根和洛克菲勒的美孚油公司、大通银行、美国钢铁公司等大公司建立了密切的关系。同时，他又是国际镍公司的董事和美国钞票公司、美国农业化学公司、纽约银行、纽约第五街银行等华尔街重要的金融机构和企业的董事。
    杜勒斯和他的律师事务所的全部活动，都集中于策动为华尔街谋取血腥利润的国际性军事的冒险上。摩根的美国钢铁公司和安那坎达铜公司、洛克菲勒的美孚油公司、杜邦的化学托拉斯、梅隆的铝公司等庞大的金融机构和企业，都是通过杜勒斯的律师事务所和国际法西斯财阀集团订立各种卡特尔合同的；国际法西斯财团也都聘请杜勒斯的律师事务所为它们的法律顾问。现在杜勒斯的律师事务所的档案里，还保存着写上希特勒、墨索里尼、佛朗哥、赖伐尔等法西斯顾客的臭名的文卷。杜勒斯一直和希特勒有着血肉的关系，这种关系从一九二○年到一九四○年的二十年来一直没有间断过。美国的一位参议员曾经揭露过这一点说：“杜勒斯先生的关系之一，是他与那些拯救希特勒……和建立希特勒的纳粹党的银行界的往来”。一九三二年，杜勒斯就代表美国的投资者，一连三次出席了德国法西斯财阀沙赫特召开的国际债务会议。以后，杜勒斯又以德国法西斯托拉斯的法本公司和德国法西斯财团的斯劳斯银行的法律顾问的资格，为德国法西斯财阀们取得了美国财阀们的二十亿美元的投资，作为准备侵略战争的资本。
    杜勒斯和中国反动派之间更是有着祖传的关系。远在一八九五年，满清政府被日本战败议和的时候，他的祖父老杜勒斯就到中国担任了满清政府议和团的顾问，就在老杜勒斯的“顾问”之下，满清政府才正式把台湾割让给日本。一九○七年满清政府参加海牙会议的时候，曾被迫聘请两个美国人作为“中国代表”，其中之一就是老杜勒斯，而且他这次还把他的十九岁的孙子小杜勒斯带着，让他担任了满清政府代表团的秘书。当时老杜勒斯曾讥讽地说：当真正的中国代表抗议他们祖国的土地受到武装侵略的时候，他们所得的只是一片嘻笑声。杜勒斯侵略别人，仇恨被压迫民族的本性就是这样被培养起来的。
    杜勒斯和华尔街之间的千丝万缕的关系，使他成为美国外交界的红人。自从一九四五年他被任命为美国出席旧金山会议代表团的顾问以来，在美国所参加的国际会议上都少不了他，华尔街把他们的这个忠诚的奴仆作为美国出席历届联合国大会代表团中的一个永远不变的代表。在联合国大会上可以常常听到他诬蔑苏联和中国，反对裁军，反对禁用原子武器和反对五大国缔结和平公约的叫嚣，可以看到他不断地霎着神经质的右眼，大声喧嚷：“我们不想过分尊重雅尔塔协定和波茨坦宣言。”一九四八年美国和英国讨论太平洋公约军事联盟内容的时候，杜勒斯就是一个积极策划和鼓动的人。一九五一年九月，他一手包办了单独对日和约与所谓“美日安全条约”的签订。
    美国新闻界把杜勒斯叫做“冷战部长”是十分恰当的。早在一九四五年，杜勒斯就曾在美国制造商协会的会议上叫嚣：美国应负起“在道义上领导世界的责任。”一九四七年二月，杜勒斯在芝加哥演说的时候，继续鼓吹美国应在世界上建立起统治地位。一九四九年春天巴黎会议之后，杜勒斯警告美国人民应该“人为地保持紧张心理”。他在“战争乎，和平乎”中并且发出一种反对禁用原子武器的怪论说：“如果大量屠杀的武器真能毁掉，我们大家都自然放了心。但是这样可并非就是‘和平’。这只是说，我们将稍稍迟一点死，而不是早一点死，也许可以说，我们将慢慢地死，而不是快快地死。”今年一月，当杜勒斯爬上国务卿的高位以后，他就更加嚣张起来，一月二十七日他所发表的反苏反共演说，就是大家所熟知的极端狂妄的表现。
    然而，谁都知道，杜勒斯不仅是美国政府的“冷战部长”，而且还是“热战”先锋。一九五○年六月，他亲自跑到朝鲜的三八线上，部署李承晚的军队发动进攻，就是众所周知的例证。
    朝鲜的战火终于被力量强大的中朝人民扑灭了。杜勒斯的一场好梦终于破灭了。然而侵略者是不甘心失败的。因此，杜勒斯又匆匆跑到朝鲜来，和李承晚一起进行破坏和平解决朝鲜问题的阴谋。中朝人民和全世界反对战争的人民，正在加倍警惕，准备随时给好战分子们的任何新阴谋以迎头痛击。
