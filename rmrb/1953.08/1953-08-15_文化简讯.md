    40,000 Workers in Chongqing Complete First Phase of Spare-Time Political Schools at Factories and Mines
    The first phase of 124 workers' spare-time political schools in factories and mines in Chongqing concluded in July. Approximately 40,000 workers have enhanced their class consciousness after receiving systematic education on communism and the Communist Party. To continue carrying out regular political education among workers, Chongqing will open the second phase of workers' spare-time political schools in September.
    Workers' spare-time political schools in Chongqing's factories and mines generally operate in the evenings, with classes held for two hours per week. Each school resolutely implemented the educational policy of Party committee leadership, trade union responsibility, and striving for cooperation from relevant parties. They also implemented the principle of closely integrating political education with production, linking it to reality, and serving production and central tasks. Each class and group was organized based on production workshops and production teams. Political instructors participated in the production meetings of relevant workshops and regularly delved into the workshops to investigate and understand the workers' production and ideological situations, striving to ensure that the content of lectures combined theory with practice. Each factory and mine now has a sufficient number of worker political instructors. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions began in 1951 to continuously select nearly 400 workers from various factories in three batches to study at the "Worker Political Instructor Training Class" of the Southwest People's Revolutionary University. To help these instructors prepare lessons, the Chongqing Municipal Workers' Political Education Committee also organized responsible cadres from relevant agencies to form a lecture group, taking turns to assist the worker political instructors. Because the worker political instructors have long lived with the workers, they understand the workers' needs best, and the content of their lectures is easily accepted by the workers.
    At the end of the first phase of workers' spare-time political schools in Chongqing, the participating workers generally underwent examinations and selected study models. After more than ten months of workers' political education, a large number of worker political instructors have also grown.
    More Than 2,000 Graduates from Secondary Technical Schools in Southwest China to Take Up Work Posts According to National Construction Needs
    This semester, secondary technical schools in the Southwest region specializing in industry, agriculture, finance, and economics have 2,010 graduates who will soon take up work posts according to the needs of national construction. Among these graduates, engineering and agricultural students account for 76% of the total. Engineering specialties include machinery, casting, exploration, mining, electrical engineering, and farmland water conservancy construction. After more than two years of professional training, these students generally have mastered a certain amount of scientific theoretical knowledge and operational skills.
    Schools such as the Southwest Second Mechanical Industry School and Chongqing Machinery School have relatively adequate teaching equipment and better faculty conditions, resulting in higher-quality students. These graduates will take up work posts around August 20th.
    Shanghai Research Institute for Culture and History Established
    The Shanghai Research Institute for Culture and History has recently been established. The institute held a tea party for its members on the afternoon of July 17th, attended by over 40 people, including Vice-Directors Jiang Yong, Li Qingya, and Chen Yusun. Jin Zhonghua, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai Municipality, Xu Pingyu, Secretary-General, and Zhou Rongguang of the United Front Work Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, also attended. Jin Zhonghua spoke at the meeting, saying: We must implement the spirit of "respecting the elderly and honoring culture." At this time of large-scale national construction, we hope that everyone will focus on research and contribute their insights to the people. Institute members Ding Yuanpu and Yuan Xiluo expressed that in the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, their knowledge could not be applied. Now, with the attention and care of the People's Government, they must strive to continue their research and contribute their findings to the people.
    The members of the Research Institute for Culture and History are generally over 60 years old, possess considerable knowledge, and enjoy a certain reputation in the local area, specializing in research work on Chinese painting, literature, political economy, and other aspects of culture and history. After the establishment of the Research Institute for Culture and History, they will be divided into groups for Chinese painting, sculpture, literature, and other areas to conduct research work.
    Graduation of Trainees from the Teacher Training Class for Ethnic Minorities at Qinghai Provincial Normal School

During their year and a half of study, the trainees completed the general courses equivalent to a junior normal school. Before graduating, they interned at the Garang Tibetan Primary School in Guide County, Qinghai Province.
    At the time of graduation, Xi Rao Jiacuo (Tibetan), Deputy Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, encouraged everyone to diligently shoulder the important responsibility of developing their ethnic cultures.

    重庆市四万工人在各厂矿第一期工人业余政治学校学习结束
    重庆市各厂矿第一期工人业余政治学校共一百二十四所，已经在七月份内结束。约近四万工人在受过系统的共产主义与共产党的教育后，提高了阶级觉悟。为了继续在工人中开展经常性的政治教育工作，重庆市将在九月开办第二期工人业余政治学校。
    重庆市各厂矿的工人业余政治学校一般都在晚上进行，每周上课两小时。各个学校坚决贯彻了党委领导、工会负责、争取有关方面配合的办学方针，并贯彻了政治教育密切结合生产、联系实际、为生产和中心工作服务的原则。各个班、组以生产车间和生产小组为单位。政治教员参加各有关车间的生产会议并经常深入车间调查了解工人的生产和思想情况，尽量使讲课内容做到理论与实际相结合。各厂矿现在都有了足够的工人政治教员。中共重庆市委员会和市总工会在一九五一年就开始连续抽调各厂工人近四百人分三批到西南人民革命大学“工人政治教员训练班”学习。为了帮助这些教员备课，重庆市工人政治教育委员会又组织了各有关机关的负责干部成立讲师团，轮流帮助工人政治教员。由于工人政治教员长期与工人生活在一起，因此他们最懂得工人的需要，讲课内容容易为工人接受。
    重庆市各厂矿第一期工人业余政治学校结束时，参加学习的工人一般都经过了考试，并评选了学习模范。经过十个多月的工人政治教育，大批的工人政治教员也成长起来了。
