Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 7th:

    On August 4th, at 4:30 PM, within the area of the Seventh Joint Observer Group, 34 soldiers of the Lee Seung-man's (Syngman Rhee) puppet army, in two trucks, crossed the military demarcation line near Kuri-shil, southeast of Kimhwa, and intruded into our side's demilitarized zone. One of the trucks, along with 17 Lee puppet soldiers, was immediately stopped near Chestnut Village by our unarmed personnel clearing dangers in the demilitarized zone and detained. Bai Bingxun, the chief member of our side of the Seventh Joint Observer Group, immediately notified Bentley, the chief member of the U.S. side, to hold a meeting. At the meeting, Lee Seon-yeong, a lieutenant of the detained Lee puppet army, confessed that they all knew that crossing the military demarcation line was a violation of the agreement, but they were personally ordered by the commander of the 8th Division of the Lee puppet army, pointing to the map. On August 2nd, at 4:30 PM, he had also led ten puppet soldiers in a truck, via the same route, to intrude into our side's demilitarized zone. When Lee Seon-yeong made the above confession, Bentley, the chief member of the U.S. side, frequently waved his hands at him, even rushing over to cover his mouth in a panic. But in the face of undeniable facts, Bentley had to admit it and issued a written statement, believing that this was indeed an incident of the Lee puppet army violating the agreement.
    On August 6th, Coleman, Secretary-General of the U.S. side of the Military Armistice Commission, admitted the above-mentioned incident of the South Korean army violating the agreement by crossing the military demarcation line and intruding into our side's demilitarized zone, and claimed that he was prepared to punish the personnel who violated the agreement. Our side stated: As long as the U.S. side takes measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, it is not necessary to take further measures regarding this incident. Our side also released the Lee Seung-man puppet army personnel who were detained by our side for violating the agreement. This fully demonstrates the firm stance and magnanimous spirit of the Korean and Chinese side towards the other side's violation of the agreement.

    美方四日违反停战协定经过
    【新华社开城七日电】八月四日下午四时半，在第七联合观察小组地段内，李承晚伪军三十四人乘两辆卡车越过金城东南巨里室附近军事分界线，侵入我方非军事区。其中一辆卡车连同乘车的十七名李伪军，当即被在非军事区内清除危险物的我方非武装人员拦阻在栗城洞附近，并予以扣留。第七联合观察小组我方首席组员白炳勋上校当即通知美方首席组员本特里开会。会上，被扣留的李伪军大尉李善英供认，他们都知道越过军事分界线是违反协议的，但他们是李伪军第八师师长指着地图亲自下令派来的。在八月二日下午四时半，他也曾带领十名伪军乘卡车经同一路线侵入过我方非军事区。当李善英作上述供认时，美方首席组员本特里曾频频向他摇手示意，甚至慌张地跑过去堵住他的嘴。但在确凿的事实面前，本特里只好承认，并发表书面声明，认为这确是李伪军违反协议的事件。
    八月六日，军事停战委员会美方秘书长柯尔曼承认了上述南朝鲜军违反协议越过军事分界线，侵入我方非军事区的事件，并声称准备对违反协议的人员进行处分。我方表示：只要美方采取措施，防止今后不再发生类似事件，对此次事件可不必采取进一步措施。我方并将因违反协议而被我方扣留的李承晚伪军人员释放。这充分表明朝中方面对于对方违反协议事件的坚决立场和宽大精神。
