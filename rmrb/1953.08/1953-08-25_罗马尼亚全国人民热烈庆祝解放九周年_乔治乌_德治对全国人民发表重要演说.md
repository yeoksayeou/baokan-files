Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: Bucharest news: The Romanian people warmly celebrate the ninth anniversary of the liberation of Romania by the Soviet army. In the capital Bucharest, working people held a celebration rally on the eve of the festival—August 22nd, and a grand parade on the 23rd. In other cities and villages throughout Romania, mass rallies, parades, or sports meets were also held to celebrate the festival.

    The celebration rally of the working people of Bucharest on August 22nd was held in a great atmosphere of political enthusiasm. When Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, Petru Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly, and other leaders of the Workers' Party and the government took their seats on the presidium, the whole hall burst into warm applause. After the opening of the celebration rally, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej delivered an important speech. He first reviewed the significant achievements made by the Romanian people in national economic construction since liberation. He said that in the era of the people's power, Romania's total industrial output has exceeded the highest level achieved in the bourgeois era. In 1953, Romania's total industrial output was almost two and a half times that of 1938 before World War II. By the end of 1953, the national oil production will reach 9.3 million tons, while it was only 8.6 million tons in 1936 before the war. This year's coal production will reach 6.1 million tons, power generation capacity will reach 1.05 million kilowatts, and steel production will reach 750,000 tons. The industrial sectors producing necessities are also developing day by day. In terms of agricultural collectivization, Romania now has 300,000 peasant households organized into 1,980 collective farms and approximately 2,000 mutual aid teams. There are now 218 machine tractor stations in the country, with a total of 9,680 tractors, 2,850 seeders, 1,440 hay balers, and 2,970 cultivators. The material and cultural living standards of the people have also improved compared to the past.

    Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej then spoke about the enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party held in mid-August. He pointed out that the meeting considered that Romania's economic policy, in addition to the achievements already made, also had serious shortcomings. That is: the pace of industrialization was too hasty, and the investment was not entirely in line with the requirements for the proportional development of various sectors of the national economy. In order to resolutely eliminate these shortcomings and improve the living conditions of urban and rural working people in the near future, it is necessary to make the work of eliminating backwardness in agriculture, the food industry, and light industry the focus of the Workers' Party and the government's concern. In order to achieve this goal, the Central Committee of the Party and the government believe that it is necessary to reduce the accumulation fund from 1953 to 1955 to 27.8 percent, and increase the consumption fund used to meet the material and cultural needs of the working people to 72.2 percent. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej said, we are confident that our belief that we are successfully solving the new tasks stipulated by the plenary session of the Central Committee is based on the fact that our people believe that the Party's policy is their own policy, and resolutely work hard to implement this policy. The strength of the Party's policy also lies in the fact that the Party follows the great teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and that all decisions and measures of the Party are the result of the collective work of the Central Committee.

    Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej also spoke about the current international situation. He pointed out that the peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union has achieved many successes in the struggle to ease international tensions and prevent a new world war. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a great victory for the peace and democratic camp. The recent proposals put forward by the Soviet government in its notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of German reunification are fully in line with the security requirements of the people of European countries and the vital interests of the German people. The bankruptcy of the United States' means of blackmail and intimidation by using the atomic bomb monopoly and the hydrogen bomb monopoly has further strengthened the confidence of the people of all countries in the forces of peace. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized: The people of the world are demanding peace. The vigilance of the people of all countries is constantly increasing. The Romanian people and its government will do their best to carry out peaceful construction and continue to fight to defend the cause of world peace.

    Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's speech was repeatedly greeted with warm applause from the whole hall. The celebration rally finally adopted a telegram of tribute to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

    罗马尼亚全国人民热烈庆祝解放九周年
    乔治乌—德治对全国人民发表重要演说
    【新华社二十四日讯】布加勒斯特消息：罗马尼亚人民热烈庆祝苏联军队解放罗马尼亚九周年。在首都布加勒斯特，劳动人民在节日前夕——二十二日举行了庆祝大会，又在二十三日举行了盛大的游行。在罗马尼亚其他各地城市和乡村，也纷纷举行了庆祝节日的群众大会、游行或体育大会。
    布加勒斯特劳动人民二十二日的庆祝大会，是在巨大的政治热情中举行的。当罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席、工人党中央委员会总书记乔治乌—德治，国民议会主席团主席彼·格罗查，以及工人党和政府的其他领袖们在主席团的席位上就座时，全场响起了热烈的掌声。庆祝大会开幕后，乔治乌—德治在会上发表了重要的演说。他首先回顾了罗马尼亚人民自解放以来在国民经济建设方面所获得的重大成就。他说，在人民政权的年代中，罗马尼亚的工业生产总额已超过了资产阶级时代所达到的最高水平。一九五三年罗马尼亚的工业总产量几乎增为第二次世界大战前一九三八年的两倍半。到一九五三年底，全国石油产量将达九百三十万吨，而在战前的一九三六年不过是八百六十万吨。今年的煤产量将达六百一十万吨，发电能力将达一百零五万瓩，钢产量将达七十五万吨。生产必需品的工业部门也在一天天发展着。在农业合作化方面，罗马尼亚现在有三十万户农民组织成一千九百八十个集体农庄和大约两千个共耕互助社。现在全国共有机器拖拉机站二百一十八个，它们共拥有拖拉机九千六百八十台，播种机二千八百五十台，捆草机一千四百四十台，耕耘机二千九百七十台。人民的物质和文化生活水平也比过去提高了。
    乔治乌—德治接着谈到了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会八月中旬举行的扩大全体会议。他指出，会议认为罗马尼亚的经济政策除了已经获得的成就之外，也存在着严重的缺点。这就是：工业化的速度操之过急，投资不完全符合国民经济各部门按比例发展的要求。为了坚决消灭这些缺点和在最近期间改进城乡劳动人民的生活条件，必须把消灭农业、食品工业和轻工业生产中的落后现象的工作，当作工人党和政府关怀的中心。为了实现这个目标，党中央委员会和政府认为必须把一九五三年到一九五五年的积累基金削减到百分之二十七点八，而把用来满足劳动人民的物质和文化需要的消费基金增加到百分之七十二点二。乔治乌—德治说，我们确信，我们正在胜利地解决中央委员会全体会议规定的新任务这种信心的根据是：我们人民认为党的政策就是他们自己的政策，并且坚决地为实现这个政策而努力工作。党的政策的力量还在于：党遵循着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大学说，而且党的一切决议和措施都是党中央委员会集体工作的结果。
    乔治乌—德治还谈到了目前的国际形势。他指出，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，在为缓和国际紧张局势、防止新世界大战的斗争中，获得了许多成绩。朝鲜停战协定的签订是和平民主阵营的一个巨大的胜利。最近苏联政府在致美英法三国政府照会中提出的关于统一德国问题的建议，完全符合欧洲各国人民的安全要求和德国人民的切身利益。美国利用原子弹垄断和氢弹垄断来进行讹诈与恫吓的手段的破产，更加加强了各国人民对于和平力量的信心。乔治乌—德治强调说：全世界人民都在要求和平。各国人民的警惕性已在不断提高。罗马尼亚人民和它的政府要以全力进行和平建设，并为保卫世界和平事业而继续奋斗。
    乔治乌—德治的演说不断博得全场热烈的掌声。庆祝大会最后通过了向苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议致敬的电报。
