Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 29th: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the morning of August 28 to discuss the proposals regarding the political conference on the Korean issue passed by the Political Committee on August 27.

The President of the United Nations General Assembly, Pearson, asked the representatives of various countries whether they requested a discussion of the Political Committee's report before the vote. Soviet representative Vyshinsky proposed discussing the report, but his proposal was rejected by a vote of 36 against, 11 in favor, and 12 abstentions. Subsequently, the President announced that some delegations wished to explain the reasons for their vote.

Indian representative Menon spoke. He spoke about the proposal regarding India's participation in the political conference. He expressed regret for the dispute that had arisen over this proposal. Menon said that under these circumstances, the Indian government believes that "the purpose of peace can be best achieved if it is not insisted that the General Assembly vote on the proposal regarding India's participation in the conference."

The representative of New Zealand, representing the countries that proposed India's participation in the conference, requested the withdrawal of this proposal.

U.S. representative Lodge spoke in praise of India's attitude.

Representatives of Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland spoke successively, firmly supporting the Soviet proposal and the Soviet amendments to the fifteen-nation proposal.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky pointed out that the fifteen-nation proposal does not conform to the principles of Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement. He said that some of the countries that put forward the fifteen-nation proposal, especially the proposal put forward by Britain, are clearly in contradiction with the principle of limiting the members of the political conference to the belligerent parties. Vyshinsky believed that this proves that not all countries that put forward the fifteen-nation proposal are satisfied with this proposal. He said that the Soviet delegation will vote against the fifteen-nation proposal.

After the Syrian representative spoke, the President began to put the fifteen-nation proposal to a vote. The United Nations General Assembly did not pass the Soviet amendment to the fifteen-nation proposal. Forty votes were against the amendment, five votes were in favor, and eleven votes abstained. Subsequently, the General Assembly passed the amendment proposed by Ecuador and other Latin American countries that made insignificant modifications to the fifteen-nation proposal. After this, the United Nations General Assembly passed the fifteen-nation proposal with 43 votes in favor, 5 votes against, and 10 votes abstaining.

The General Assembly passed the proposal regarding the Soviet Union's participation in the political conference, which was conditional: "if the other party so desires." However, the General Assembly rejected the Soviet amendment to this proposal. There were 55 votes in favor of the proposal regarding the Soviet Union's participation in the political conference, one vote against, and one vote abstaining.

The General Assembly passed, by a vote of 54 to 3 (with 1 abstention), a motion requesting the Secretary-General of the United Nations to forward to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea "the various proposals on the Korean issue put forward at the resumed session of the Seventh General Assembly, as well as the various recommendations of the conference," together with the records of the relevant meetings of the General Assembly.

The General Assembly rejected the Soviet proposal regarding the members of the political conference. Forty-two votes were against the Soviet proposal, five votes were in favor, and twelve votes abstained.

At the plenary session on the afternoon of the 28th, representatives continued to speak, explaining the reasons for their votes on the proposal regarding the members of the Korean political conference. Subsequently, the meeting discussed another fifteen-nation proposal. This proposal, after expressing deep satisfaction with the conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement, paid "tribute" to the soldiers of the South Korean army and the "United Nations forces" who participated in the aggression against Korea.

Representatives of the United States, Australia, and other countries spoke in support of this proposal.

Soviet representative Vyshinsky exposed the true essence of this proposal. He said that this proposal attempts to glorify the aggression against Korea and distort history. Vyshinsky said that this proposal contains elements that can be considered as an expression of hostility towards the Soviet Union, the Korean people, and the People's Republic of China. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union will vote against this proposal, which is incompatible with the identity of the United Nations. He pointed out that this proposal attempts to perpetuate lies, which have long been exposed by the documentary evidence presented by the Soviet Union since 1950. This documentary evidence clearly proves that the foreign interventionists and the Rhee Syngman government of South Korea were responsible for the Korean War.

Polish representative Naszkowski supported the speech of the Soviet representative. Czechoslovak representative Sekaninova said that millions of peace-loving people around the world have no doubt who is responsible for the Korean War, which is essentially an American war against the Korean people. Sekaninova praised the heroic spirit of the Korean people in fighting for freedom and independence and against the aggression of the interventionists.

When finally put to a vote, the fifteen-nation proposal was passed with 52 votes in favor and 5 votes against.

Subsequently, the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Pearson, announced the closing of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

    联合国第七届大会结束对朝鲜问题的讨论
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：联合国大会于八月二十八日上午举行全体会议，讨论政治委员会八月二十七日通过的关于朝鲜问题政治会议的各项提案。
    联合国大会主席皮尔逊询问各国代表是否要求在付表决以前对政治委员会的报告进行讨论。苏联代表维辛斯基提议讨论这个报告，但是他的提议以三十六票反对、十一票赞成、十二票弃权遭到否决。接着，主席宣布，一些代表团希望解释投票理由。
    印度代表梅农发言。他谈到关于印度参加政治会议的提案。他对为了这个提案而发生争执一节，表示遗憾。梅农说，在这种情况下，印度政府认为：“如果不坚持要大会对关于印度参加会议的提案进行表决，可以最好地达到和平的目的。”
    新西兰代表，代表提出关于印度参加会议的提案的国家，请求撤消这一提案。
    美国代表洛奇发言赞扬印度的态度。
    捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰代表相继发言，坚决支持苏联提案和苏联对十五国提案的修正案。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言指出，十五国提案是不符合朝鲜停战协定第六十款的原则的。他说，提出十五国提案的国家中有一些国家，特别是英国所提出的提案，显然和把政治会议的成员限于交战双方这一原则相矛盾的。维辛斯基认为，这就证明并不是提出十五国提案的所有国家全都满意这个提案。他说，苏联代表团将投票反对十五国提案。
    在叙利亚代表发言后，主席开始将十五国提案付表决。联合国大会没有通过苏联对十五国提案的修正案。四十票反对修正案，五票赞成，十一票弃权。接着，通过了厄瓜多尔和其他一些拉丁美洲国家提出的对十五国提案作了无关紧要的修改的修正案。在这之后，联合国大会以四十三票赞成、五票反对、十票弃权，通过了十五国提案。
    大会通过了关于苏联参加政治会议的提案，其中附有条件：“如果对方愿欲的话”。但是，大会否决了苏联对这个提案的修正案。赞成关于苏联参加政治会议提案的有五十五票，一票反对，一票弃权。
    大会以五十四票对三票（一票弃权）通过了请联合国秘书长把“在第七届大会复会后的会议上提出的关于朝鲜问题的各项提案以及会议的各项建议案”，连同大会有关会议的记录，送交中华人民共和国中央人民政府与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府。
    大会否决了苏联关于政治会议成员的提案。反对苏联提案的有四十二票，五票赞成，十二票弃权。
    在二十八日下午的全体会议上，代表们继续发言，解释对朝鲜政治会议成员问题的提案的投票理由。接着，会议就讨论十五国另一个提案。这个提案在对朝鲜停战协定的达成表示深为满意以后，向南朝鲜军和参加侵略朝鲜的“联合国军”军人“致敬”。
    美国、澳大利亚和其他一些国家的代表发言支持这个提案。
    苏联代表维辛斯基揭穿了这个提案的真正本质。他说，这个提案企图颂扬对朝鲜的侵略，并歪曲历史。维辛斯基说，这个提案包含了一些可以认为是对苏联、朝鲜人民和中华人民共和国的敌意表示的成分。维辛斯基说，苏联将投票反对这个不合联合国身份的提案。他指出，这个提案企图使谎话永存不灭，而这种谎话老早就被苏联从一九五○年以来提出的文件证据揭穿了。这些文件证据明显地证明，对朝鲜战争负责的是外国干涉者和南朝鲜的李承晚政府。
    波兰代表纳希科夫斯基支持苏联代表的发言。捷克斯洛伐克代表塞卡尼诺娃说，全世界千百万爱好和平的人们，毫不怀疑是谁应对朝鲜战争负责，这个战争本质上是美国对朝鲜人民的战争。塞卡尼诺娃赞扬为争取自由和独立、为反对干涉者的侵略而斗争的朝鲜人民的英雄气概。
    最后付表决时，十五国提案以五十二票赞成通过，五票反对。
    接着，联合国大会主席皮尔逊宣布联合国第七届大会闭幕。
