A Visit to the Construction Site of Ma'anshan Iron Mine
Xu Chang

The Past and Present of Ma'anshan
The Ma'anshan Iron Mine suffered severe damage from Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Until last winter, a few remaining furnace shells and chimneys stood forlornly in the wilderness. The chimneys had not smoked for more than eight years, and the iron smelting furnaces were overgrown with small trees and weeds. This spring, with the call for large-scale construction in the motherland, Ma'anshan changed dramatically. Thousands of workers, technicians, and management cadres from all over the country gathered in Ma'anshan, including construction teams from Wuhu, mechanical engineering teams from Taiyuan, and workers from Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Hankou, Shijingshan, Benxi, and various parts of Anhui. They joined with the factory's workers to form civil engineering teams, mechanical repair teams, electrical engineering teams, and hoisting teams, encompassing nearly twenty types of trades. Large quantities of building materials and equipment were continuously transported to the construction site from all over the country, with refractory bricks alone amounting to tens of thousands of tons. The construction site was filled with working crowds, and the sounds of electric shovels, motors, and various metal mechanical impacts blended together. Old and unsuitable equipment was torn down, and new equipment was installed. In just a few months, the workers, with their own hands and wisdom, changed the face of Ma'anshan and are striving to get the No. 2 iron smelting furnace to produce iron in September.

A Tense Labor Scene
Stepping into the construction site, one immediately sees a row of chimneys ten stories high standing like giants, with huge hot blast stoves to the south. Hoisting workers are busy on top of the iron smelting furnace, lifting iron plates and lumber piece by piece. Electric welders wearing masks are working on the steel framework, with streams of sparks scattering to the ground. Scaffolders with safety belts are freely moving in the frighteningly high air. Riveters' riveting guns are impacting the iron plates with a "dong, dong, dong, dong" sound. Cement mixers are turning all day long, voraciously swallowing "sandwiches" made of stones, water, and cement. The sound of forging from the eastern forging workshop and the sound of motors from the repair shop blend together. The newly built chimneys are climbing upward day and night like bamboo shoots emerging from the soil, and have now climbed past the roof of the blower workshop. To the east, a train is unloading steel plates and iron pipes. With a sharp "woo" sound, another train appears from the west by the river, fully loaded with yellow sand, stones, and cement, speeding along the foothills.

The People Building Ma'anshan
The sun is like a fiery umbrella spreading out. After noon, everything on the construction site becomes hot, and the blast furnace and hot blast stove become large "steamers." But this has not defeated the people building Ma'anshan. Slogans are posted everywhere on the construction site:

"Only the development of steel production can lead to national industrialization," "Complete the task ahead of schedule and ensure iron production in September." It's not just slogans. Look, the riveters of the Taiyuan Engineering Team took off their vests printed with the red characters "Tai Gang" (Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant), picked up riveting guns, and climbed up the hot blast stove using rope ladders. Some went into the furnace naked to rivet, with sweat soaking their entire bodies like rain. They composed a ditty to describe this scene: "Riveting on the hot blast stove is like taking a bath, dedicating ourselves to the motherland for construction." Some of them have been supporting construction in various places for several years and have not been home. This time, they came to Ma'anshan from three thousand miles away. Don't they miss their loved ones? I found the answer in their ditty: "Without steel, there is no country. If the task is not completed, we will not go home. When will we return to Taiyuan? We can see [our families] when the task is completed." This is just as one worker said: "People's hearts are made of flesh. It would be strange not to think about it. You think of your loved ones, and the motherland is thinking of you. Which of the two questions is important? You understand it once you think about it." In the Taiyuan Engineering Team, there is a respected welder named Liu Qingshun. Those who know him told me that since he came here from the Shanghai Xinhu Iron and Steel Plant, seeing that there were not enough welders in the Taiyuan team, he volunteered to transfer to provide support. He has always been active in his work. One day, he had a fever but insisted on working. The leadership ordered him to rest for a while. He kept saying, "Let's work harder, the blast furnace's iron production is important." He firmly remembered that many hardware factories in Shanghai launched patriotic labor competitions, which were often very lively, but suddenly the raw materials could not be connected. Asking the leadership, the answer was: pig iron must come from the Northeast, the road is long, and the freight is overdue. Originally it was a labor competition, but it turned into work stoppage waiting for materials, which was really infuriating. Therefore, when he heard about the reconstruction of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, he was the first to respond to the leadership's call and came here.

One morning, I was chatting on the construction site with Wu Xiaokun, a young management cadre from Tianjin. At first, he told me about the workers' enthusiasm and technical improvements in their team. Later, he talked about life. He said, "We have an old saying: don't go south in summer, don't go north in winter, but I went south in summer." Then, he told me that riveters Sun Yushu and Wang Jinsheng came to participate in the construction not long after they got married. What for? Everyone understands. And before Wang Menglan left, his fiancée came to see him off at the Tianjin Railway Station. Recently, she wrote a letter, and we rushed to read it. It said: Hurry up and complete the task ahead of schedule and return to Tianjin victoriously.... Wu Xiaokun stopped speaking here. "What about you?" I asked him. He blushed, as if I had guessed it, and had to say: "I have such a thing too. Last year, I returned to my hometown of Xianyang for the New Year and got engaged to a female loom operator in the state-owned Xianyang No. 1 Cotton Mill. We agreed to get married on the Mid-Autumn Festival this year. I calculated the task of my team..." "Mid-Autumn Festival! Is it around October?" I interrupted him, presumptuously guessing for him. "No, September 22nd." He immediately corrected me and said solemnly to me: "I haven't told anyone else about this date except for the people in our two families. Because I'm afraid that if the leadership knows, they will ask me to go home at that time. Although the work in our team can be completed on September 5th, if there are new tasks, then I must complete the tasks first and then go home to get married." I shook his hand tightly, silently wishing his double-happiness festival to arrive quickly.

    马鞍山铁矿厂工地访问记
    徐常
    马鞍山的今昔
    马鞍山铁矿厂，曾遭受日寇和蒋匪严重破坏，直到去年冬天，几座残存的炉壳和烟囱，还孤零零地立在荒草地上。烟囱已有八年多没有冒烟了，炼铁炉旁长满了小树和野草。今年春天，祖国大规模建设的号声一响，马鞍山就变了样。数以千计的工人、技术人员、管理干部们不断地从全国各地会师在马鞍山，其中有来自芜湖的建筑工程队，有来自太原的机械工程队，还有来自上海、青岛、天津、汉口、石景山、本溪以及安徽各地的工人，和该厂的工人们合拢一起组成了土木建筑队、机械修配队、电器工程队、起重队，包括近二十种的工种。大批建筑材料和器材从各地源源不断地运往工地，光是耐火砖一项就达万吨。工地上到处是劳动着的人群，电铲声、马达声以及各种各样金属机械的冲击声响成一片。旧的不合用的设备倒下了，新的设备安装起来了。职工们用自己的双手和智慧，在短短几个月中，改变了马鞍山的面貌。并要争取二号炼铁炉在九月出铁。
    紧张的劳动场面
    踏进工地，迎面就见一排十层楼高的烟囱像巨人样屹立着，在它的南面是巨大的热风炉。起重工们在炼铁炉顶上正在忙着，铁板、木料一件件在上升，戴着面罩的电焊工人，在钢铁的骨架上工作，
    一串串的火花向地下迸散着。背着安全带的架工们在令人心悸的高空中自由活动着。铆工们手中的铆钉枪“咚咚咚咚”的冲击着铁板。水泥搅拌机整日地转动着，大口吞食由石子、水、水泥制成的“三明治”。东边锻工间的打铁声和修配车间的马达声响成一片。新建的烟囱像出土的笋，日夜向上爬，现在已爬过鼓风机车间的屋顶了。东边一列火车正在卸下钢板、铁管，“呜”的一声尖叫，从西面江边又出现了一列火车，满载着黄沙、石子、水泥，沿着山麓飞奔过来。
    建设马鞍山的人们
    太阳像一把火伞样张着，过午，工地上什么都发烫，高炉和热风炉变成个大“蒸笼”。但是这并没有把建设马鞍山的人们难倒，工地上到处贴着：
    “只有钢铁生产的发展，才有国家工业化”、“提前完成任务、保证九月出铁”的标语。不仅仅是标语，你看：太原工程队的铆工们把印有红色“太钢”
    （太原钢铁厂）两字的背心脱去了，手拿铆钉枪，攀着绳梯爬上热风炉去。有的一丝不挂地钻进炉里去铆钉，汗珠像雨样地浸透了全身。他们把这个情景编成一句顺口溜：“热风炉上铆钉像洗澡，献身祖国为建设。”他们中间有的人为了支援各地建设，已好几年没回家，这次又从三千里外来到马鞍山。难道不想自己的亲人吗？我从他们的顺口溜中找到了答案：“没有钢铁就没有国家，完不成任务不回家，何时起身回太原，完成任务就可见。”这正如
    一位工人所说：“人心是肉做的，不想那才是怪话，你想亲人，祖国正想你，两个问题，那个重要，一想就明白了。”在太原工程队里有一位被大家尊敬的焊工刘庆顺，熟悉他的人告诉我：他自从上海新沪钢铁厂来此以后，见到太原队焊工不足，就志愿请调支援，工作一贯积极。一天，他身体发烧还坚持工作，领导上命令他，才休息了一会。他老是说：“加油干呀，高炉出铁要紧。”他牢牢地记着：上海很多五金工厂开展爱国主义劳动竞赛，往往搞得热火朝天的时候，突然原料接不上了。问问领导上，回答是：生铁须从东北来，路远，货运脱期。原来是劳动竞赛，结果变成停工待料，真气死人。因此，当他听到改建马鞍山炼铁厂，就第一个响应领导号召，来到了这里。
    有一天上午，我在工地上和一位天津来的年青的管理干部武孝琨闲谈。起初，他告诉我一些他们队里工人们的工作热情和技术改进的情况，以后又谈起了生活，他说：“咱们有一句老话，夏不上南，冬不上北，我却是逢夏上南了。”接着，他又告诉我：铆工孙玉书、王金生结婚还没有多少天也来参加建设，为的是什么？大家肚里都明白。还有王梦兰临行前，他的未婚妻到天津车站来送行，最近她写来一封信，我们抢来看了，里面写着：赶紧提前完成任务，胜利归津……。武孝琨说到这里，停住不说了。“你呢？”我追问着他。他红了一下脸，似乎是被我猜透了，不得不说出：“我也有这样的事情。去年我回咸阳老家过年，和一位在国营咸阳第一棉织厂的一个挡车女工订了婚，约定今年中秋节结婚，我算算我队的任务……”“中秋吗！大概是在十月里吧？”我打断他的话，自作聪明地替他估算着。“不，九月二十二日。”他立刻加以纠正，并郑重地对我说：“这个日子除了我们两家的人外，我还没有给别人讲过。因为我怕领导上知道了，到了那时候就要我回家。虽然我们队里的工作九月五日可以完成，但如果有了新的任务，那我一定要先完成任务然后回家结婚的。”我紧握着他的手，默祝着他的双喜临门的节日迅速到来。
