Notice from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government Regarding Autumn Harvesting, Autumn Plowing, and Autumn Planting

    The time for harvesting mid-season rice and early autumn crops has begun, and the season for autumn harvesting, plowing, and planting is here. This is the most crucial period to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest this year. All regions must concentrate their efforts and lead the masses in timely autumn harvesting, plowing, and planting to ensure the complete victory of this year's increased production, prevent the loss of a year's hard work, and lay a solid foundation for next year's agricultural increase. Specific matters requiring attention are provided for reference:

    (1) Mobilize the masses to continue overcoming natural disasters. Ripe autumn crops should be harvested promptly, ensuring "good harvesting, good threshing, good drying, and good storage," paying attention to improving harvesting and threshing methods to minimize losses. In areas with heavy autumn rainfall, special attention should be paid to adopting effective methods from the local population to prevent rice lodging, sweet potato rot, and excessive cotton growth. Simultaneously, conduct seed selection, gradually guiding farmers in field ear selection (soybean plant selection, cotton boll selection), encouraging the free exchange of improved varieties among the masses, and ensuring that more seeds are retained. Earnestly safeguard autumn harvest order and prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionaries. Encourage farmers to practice thrift, expand production investments, and prevent and overcome wasteful phenomena among some farmers after a bumper harvest.

    (2) Strengthen the leadership of autumn sowing work to achieve timely sowing. The primary link in increasing wheat production is to deeply tap into the potential for increasing wheat production and improve yield per unit area, and appropriately expand the planting area according to local conditions. In the Guanzhong and southern Shanxi regions, where wheat is planted once a year, pay attention to promoting the experience of rotating alfalfa and peas with wheat, advocating increased fertilizer accumulation, and gradually overcoming the practice of planting wheat without fertilization. In the northern cotton-wheat regions, promote appropriate crop rotation and pay attention to drought prevention and moisture conservation. In the southern rice-wheat regions, improve sowing techniques and actively carry out wheat field processing and fertilization.

    Before autumn sowing, do a good job of draining water and deep plowing to conserve moisture. Mobilize farmers to seize the time after the autumn harvest to carry out early plowing and deep plowing, and overcome the phenomenon of planting wheat on hardened (unplowed) fields. In areas affected by floods, concentrate all efforts on closing breaches, repairing dikes, digging ditches, and draining water to strive for timely wheat planting. This year, wheat bunt disease has spread southward from Shandong, and wheat blossom midge is developing northward from Henan. It is necessary to advocate seed soaking, seed mixing with pesticides, and isolation of manure and seeds; select disease- and insect-resistant varieties to prevent the spread of diseases and pests. In areas with serious underground pests, promote the method of mixing arsenic-treated poisonous grains with seeds for prevention and control.

    Dense planting for increased wheat production has been proven in farmers' production. The scientific principles of dense planting for increased production should be widely publicized, and specific guidance should be given on dense planting methods. In areas with a tradition of dense planting and successful demonstrations, continue to promote it seriously. In areas without dense planting experience, focus on demonstrations by farms first and avoid blind promotion.

    Increasing fertilizer application is the main key to increasing wheat production. Adopt various effective methods to open up fertilizer sources, appropriately increase base fertilizer for wheat fields, and plan for commercial fertilizers.

    The selection of improved wheat varieties should be based on the principle of "local selection and local promotion." Organize the masses for free exchange of seeds to gradually expand the planting area of improved varieties. If foreign varieties are proven to be superior to local varieties through farm trials, actively demonstrate and promote them. For the wheat seeds stored in disaster areas this year, check the seed quality as soon as possible, and mobilize farmers to sun-dry the seeds to increase the germination rate. During sowing, pay attention to improving sowing techniques and overcome the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows.

    Other summer-harvested crops, such as naked barley, peas, broad beans, rapeseed, barley, and green manure crops, should be sown in a timely manner, improving farming methods according to local conditions, and striving for increased production. Pay attention to preparing seeds of Chinese milk vetch, hairy vetch, and alfalfa early, and plan to expand the planting area of green manure crops.

    (3) After the autumn harvest, call on the masses to carry out autumn plowing in a timely manner and appropriately deep plow on the original basis. In the arid areas of the north, pay attention to harrowing after plowing to conserve moisture. In the southern areas where rice stem borers are serious, combine plowing with digging up and destroying rice roots. In cotton-growing areas, pay attention to overcoming the contradiction between pulling cotton stalks and plowing, and do a good job of autumn plowing. In areas where new-style walking plows have been used effectively and deep plowing has been accepted by the masses, further guidance and promotion should be given. In areas where new-style walking plows are not yet used, promote the original experience of the local masses, utilize existing farm tools, and implement fine plowing and double plowing to strive for appropriate deep plowing.

    (4) To ensure the smooth progress of autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, earnestly publicize and implement the various policies of the People's Government to reward production, enhance the production enthusiasm of the masses, earnestly strengthen the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, appropriately allocate and solve the difficulties of labor and animal power, and reasonably resolve the contradictions encountered by mutual aid and cooperation organizations in rushing to harvest and plant, to give full play to the effectiveness of labor. Check on the work of substitute farming and help the families of martyrs and soldiers do a good job in autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. Cooperate with cooperative and banking departments to earnestly do a good job in supply and credit work, and help farmers solve the difficulties of production materials such as seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools. For autumn grain, cotton, and local and special products, it is recommended that trade and cooperation departments grasp reasonable prices for timely purchase and actively organize transportation and sales.

    (5) Before the autumn harvest, all regions should focus on organizing the masses within the scope of a village or township to conduct comparative observations, and prepare to convene provincial and county agricultural labor model representative meetings and district and township agricultural exhibitions after the autumn harvest. Summarize and exchange experiences in increasing production, to educate the masses and cadres with living examples and more widely publicize agricultural science and technology.

    中央人民政府农业部
    关于秋收秋耕秋种工作的通知
    目前中稻及早秋作物已经开始收割，秋收、秋耕、秋种季节已到，这是争取今年全面丰收的最紧张的季节。各地必须集中力量，领导群众及时地进行秋收、秋耕及秋种工作，既要保证今年增产的全部胜利，不使一年辛勤劳动的果实遭受损失，又要为明年农业增产打好基础。特将应注意事项提供参考：
    （一）发动群众继续克服自然灾害。已熟的秋禾应及时收割，做到“收好、打好、晒好、藏好”，注意改进收获及脱粒方法，力求减少抛撒损失。在秋季多雨地区，尤须注意采用当地群众中的有效办法，防止水稻倒伏、甘薯霉烂和棉花的徒长。同时做好选种工作，逐步引导农民进行田间穗选（大豆株选，棉花铃选），提倡群众自由兑换良种并注意多留一些种子。切实保护秋收秩序，防止反革命分子的破坏活动。鼓励农民节约，扩大生产投资，防止和克服某些农民在丰收后的浪费现象。
    （二）加强秋季播种工作的领导，达到适时播种。小麦增产的首要环节是深入发掘小麦增产潜力，提高单位面积产量，并视各地条件可能适当扩大播种面积。在关中、晋南一年一熟种麦地区，要注意推广苜蓿、豌豆与小麦轮栽的经验，提倡增积肥料，逐步克服种麦不施肥的现象。在北方棉麦地区，要提倡适当轮栽，注意防旱保墒。在南方稻麦地区，应改善播种技术，积极进行麦田加工施肥。
    在秋季播种前，要做好排涝及深耕保墒工作，动员农民抓紧秋收完毕时，实行早耕、深耕，克服板田（不耕）种麦的现象。在遭受水灾地区，应集中全力堵口、修堤、挖沟、排水，争取及时种麦。今年小麦腥黑穗病已由山东向南蔓延，吸浆虫有自河南向北发展趋势，必须提倡浸种、拌种，粪种隔离，选用抗病虫的品种，杜绝病虫害传播。在地下害虫严重地区，要推广信石毒谷拌种的办法，进行防治。
    小麦密植增产，已在农民生产中得到证明，应广泛宣传密植增产的科学道理，具体指导密植的方法。在有密植习惯和示范成功的地区，应继续认真推广。在尚无密植经验的地区，先由农场重点示范，切忌盲目推广。
    增施肥料是小麦增产的主要关键，要采取各种有效办法开辟肥源，适当增加麦田基肥，并应有计划地准备商品肥料。
    选用小麦良种要根据“就地选种，就地推广”的方针，组织群众自由换种，逐步扩大良种种植面积。外来品种经过农场试验确比当地品种优良时，也要积极进行示范和推广。对今年灾区储备的麦种，应及早检查种子质量，并须动员农民晒种，提高麦种发芽率。在播种时，注意提高播种技术，克服缺苗断条现象。
    其他夏收作物如元麦、豌豆、蚕豆、油菜、大麦及绿肥作物，均应适时播种，因地制宜地改进耕作方法，争取增产。并注意及早准备紫云英、苕子及苜蓿的种子，有计划地扩大绿肥作物的种植面积。
    （三）秋收后应号召群众及时进行秋耕，并在原有基础上适当深耕。在北方干旱地区，要注意耕后耙耱，做好保墒工作。在南方水稻螟虫严重地区，应结合耕地挖毁稻根。种棉地区，要注意克服拔棉秸和耕地的矛盾，做好秋耕。在新式步犁已经使用有效的地区，深耕已为群众所接受，应进一步指导推广。在未使用新式步犁地区，可推广当地群众原有经验，利用原有农具，实行细犁套犁，力求适当深耕。
    （四）为保证秋收、秋耕、秋种工作的顺利进行，应认真地宣传和贯彻人民政府奖励生产的各项政策，提高群众生产积极性，切实加强对互助合作组织的领导，适当地调配与解决劳力、畜力的困难，并合理地解决互助合作组织在抢收抢种中所遇到的矛盾，充分发挥劳动的效能。检查代耕工作，帮助烈、军属做好秋收、秋耕、秋种工作。配合合作、银行部门认真地做好供应与信贷工作，帮助农民解决种子、肥料、农具等生产资料的困难。对于秋粮、棉花及土、特产品，应建议贸易合作部门掌握合理价格及时收购，积极组织运销。
    （五）秋收前各地应有重点地组织群众在一个村或一个乡的范围内，进行评比观摩，并有准备地在秋后召开省、县农业劳动模范代表会和区乡农业展览会，总结交流增产经验，以活人活事教育群众和干部，更广泛地宣传农业科学技术。（新华社）
