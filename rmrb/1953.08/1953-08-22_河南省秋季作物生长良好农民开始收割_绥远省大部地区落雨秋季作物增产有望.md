	Henan Province's Autumn Crops Grow Well; Farmers Begin Harvesting
	Most Areas of Suiyuan Province Receive Rainfall; Autumn Crops Expected to Increase
	[Reported by this newspaper] In Henan Province, after strengthening autumn field management and overcoming various natural disasters, autumn crops such as sorghum and millet are growing well in most areas. If no sudden disasters occur, the province's autumn crops are expected to increase by more than 10%. Cotton and tobacco are expected to have a bumper harvest. Farmers in some areas are now harvesting early autumn crops in a tense and happy atmosphere.
	Various areas in Henan Province have focused on carrying out autumn visits and appraisal campaigns to summarize and exchange experiences in achieving high yields. Counties such as Jiyuan, Anyang, and Fugou have also held special symposiums on high wheat yields, vigorously promoting the technology of rational close planting of wheat.
	Currently, under the slogan of "harvesting and planting simultaneously, striving for greater harvests in the future," farmers in various parts of Henan are actively repairing farm tools, purchasing livestock, and consolidating mutual aid and cooperative organizations, actively preparing for autumn harvesting and planting. Some areas have integrated the current production work with the rectification and consolidation of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, paying particular attention to correcting the past deviations of agricultural production cooperatives, such as "high output, low dividends" and untimely grain distribution. The Wu Fuxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mengjin County had a bumper wheat harvest this year, but problems with the cooperative's management, labor arrangement, and profit distribution affected the production enthusiasm of its members. To learn from this lesson and complete the autumn harvest and wheat planting tasks, the entire cooperative decided to improve the contracting system and formulated an autumn grain distribution plan. In order to achieve quick harvesting, quick plowing, quick planting, and quick grain distribution, it was also decided to change the past method of settling accounts after frost and distributing grain after autumn.
	To welcome the peak season after the autumn harvest and strengthen the procurement and supply work, relevant economic departments are actively studying the procurement of grain, cotton, and tobacco. Trade departments and cooperatives have revised and expanded supply plans and opened up local sources of goods. The Henan Provincial Cooperative Union's wholesale business for the second half of the year has been expanded from the original plan of 390 billion yuan to 690 billion yuan, of which handicraft processing accounts for 159 billion yuan. The processed goods include more than 50 kinds of newly developed local sources of goods, such as cloth, socks, towels, matches, and cigarettes. The retail business plan of each grass-roots cooperative in the second half of the year has also increased from 170 billion yuan to 260 billion yuan. After thoroughly investigating the purchasing power of farmers, the Xuchang County Cooperative found that the cooperative's supply business could only meet 10% of the people's needs; at the same time, the procurement plan for the third quarter could only recover 36% of the currency it put in. After discovering these problems, the cooperative vigorously opened up sources of goods. The retail plan for the third quarter has increased by 39.4% compared to the original plan, and the total supply value accounts for 71.8% of the cooperative's own investment. This can not only largely guarantee the supply, but also, based on a net profit of 2%, the third quarter can obtain a net profit of 400 million yuan, enabling the cooperative to have a reasonable accumulation of funds.

    Xinhua News Agency Report: Most areas of Suiyuan Province received rainfall between August 10th and 15th. The highest rainfall was 21 millimeters, and the lowest was 11.6 millimeters. This autumn rain is of great benefit to the growth of autumn crops such as naked oats, sorghum, and cereals that have already headed; it also provides further guarantee for the growth of potatoes, radishes, autumn vegetables, and the bumper harvest of major autumn crops in most areas. In addition, according to the experience of local farmers, this autumn rain can also reduce the frost damage to crops during the period from the end of heat to the White Dew solar term. Now, the farmers' production enthusiasm is very high, and they are actively rushing to plant autumn vegetables. After the rain, the pastures in pastoral areas such as the Ulanqab League and the Ikezhao League of the province have gradually become lush, which is of great benefit to the preservation of livestock fat and the storage of forage grass this autumn.

    河南省秋季作物生长良好农民开始收割
    绥远省大部地区落雨秋季作物增产有望
    【本报讯】河南省各地在加强秋田管理，战胜各种自然灾害后，大部地区的高粱、谷子等秋季作物生长良好。如果不再突然发生灾害，全省秋季作物约可增产一成以上。棉花、烟叶可望丰收。现部分地区农民正在紧张愉快地收割早秋。
    河南省各地有重点地开展了秋季参观评比运动，总结和交流丰产经验。济源、安阳、扶沟等县并专门召开了小麦丰产座谈会，大力推广了小麦合理密植的技术。
    现在，河南各地农民在“随收随种，争取今后更大丰收”的口号下，正纷纷整修农具，添购牲口，整顿互助合作组织，积极准备秋收秋种工作。有些地区结合当前生产工作，整顿和巩固了互助合作组织，特别注意了纠正过去农业生产合作社的“产量高，分红少”和分粮不及时的偏向。孟津县吴福祥农业生产合作社今年小麦获得丰收，但是因为社内经营管理、劳力安排和分红有问题，影响了社员的生产情绪。为了接受这个教训，完成秋收种麦任务，全社决定改进包工制并订出了秋季分粮计划。为做到快收、快犁、快种、快分粮，还决定改变过去霜降结账、秋后分粮的办法。
    为迎接秋收后的旺季和加强收购供应工作，有关经济部门正积极研究粮食、棉花、烟叶的收购问题。贸易部门、合作社纷纷修订和扩大供应计划，开辟地方货源。河南省合作社联合社下半年的批发业务已由原计划的三千九百亿元扩大到六千九百亿元，其中手工业加工占一千五百九十亿元，加工的货物包括新辟地方货源的布匹、袜子、毛巾、火柴、纸烟等五十多种。各基层社下半年零售业务计划也由一千七百亿元增加到二千六百亿元。许昌县合作社经过深入调查农民的购买力后，发现合作社的供应业务仅能满足群众需要的百分之十；同时第三季度的收购计划，只能回笼本身投放货币的百分之三十六。该社在发现这些问题后，便大力开辟货源，第三季度零售计划已较原计划增加了百分之三十九点四，供应总值占合作社本身投放量的百分之七十一点八。这就不仅可以大体保证供应，同时按百分之二的纯益计算，第三季度可得纯益四亿元，使合作社能有合理的资金积累。（吕建中）
    【新华社讯】绥远省在八月十日到十五日间大部地区落雨。雨量最高的地区为二十一公厘，少的也有十一点六公厘。这次秋雨对已出穗的莜麦、高粱和谷类等秋季作物的生长有很大好处；对大部地区的马铃薯、萝卜、秋菜生长和大秋作物丰产，也有进一步的保障。此外，根据当地农民的经验，这次秋雨还可减少处暑到白露期间作物的冻灾。现在，农民们的生产情绪很高，正积极抢种秋菜。雨后，该省乌兰察布盟和伊克昭盟等牧区，牧草逐渐转得茂盛，对今秋牲畜保膘和储割饲草也有很大好处。
