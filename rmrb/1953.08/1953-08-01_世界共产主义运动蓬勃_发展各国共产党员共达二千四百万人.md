Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st -- "Pravda" reported on the 30th, while celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on the growth of the ranks of Communist and Workers' Parties in various countries. "Pravda" said: After the October Socialist Revolution, the process of the vigorous growth of the communist movement began. The bourgeoisie used extremely cruel methods to prevent the emergence of communist parties. However, communist parties still emerged everywhere and became increasingly consolidated. The number of communist parties is clearly demonstrated by the fact that sixty-two Communist and Workers' Parties from various countries congratulated the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and delegations from forty-four fraternal parties attended the 19th Party Congress as guests. Currently, the Communist Parties in various countries around the world have a total of 24 million members. The communist movement is now a powerful and historically significant political force. Under the leadership of the Communists, 800 million people in the countries of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp are victoriously building a new life. The largest Communist Party in the people's democratic countries is the Communist Party of China, which has more than six million members. In the various capitalist countries, a broad working class follows the Communist Party. The largest Communist Party in the capitalist countries is the Italian Communist Party. Despite the reactionaries' intensified attacks, the ranks of the Italian Communist Party continue to expand year by year. It had more than 1,770,000 members in early 1946, and by November 1952, it had increased to more than 2,130,000. Millions of Italian people support the Communist Party. The French Communist Party has achieved increasing success in its struggle. In the 1951 parliamentary elections in France, the Communist Party received more than five million votes, ranking first among all parties in the country. The Communist Parties of all countries are standard-bearers in the struggle for peace, national independence, democratic freedoms, and a bright future for the people.

    世界共产主义运动蓬勃
    发展各国共产党员共达二千四百万人
    【新华社莫斯科三十一日电】“真理报”三十日在庆祝苏联共产党建党五十周年的时候，报道了世界各国共产党和工人党队伍增长的情形。真理报说：在十月社会主义革命以后，开始了共产主义运动蓬勃成长的过程。资产阶级使用了极其残酷的办法阻止共产党的产生。但是，共产党仍然是到处产生而且日益巩固了。共产党的数量由下面的事实得到明显的证明，这就是：有六十二个各国共产党和工人党祝贺了苏联共产党第十九次代表大会，四十四个兄弟党的代表团作为来宾参加了第十九次党代表大会。现在，全世界各国的共产党共有党员二千四百万人。共产主义运动现在是强大的、有历史意义的政治力量。在共产党人的领导下，和平、民主和社会主义阵营各国的八万万人，正在胜利地建设着新的生活。在人民民主国家的共产党中最大的是中国共产党，它有六百多万共产党员。在各资本主义国家里，广大的劳动者阶层都跟着共产党走。资本主义国家中最大的共产党是意大利共产党。尽管反动派日益加强进攻，意大利共产党的队伍还是年年扩大。它在一九四六年初有党员一百七十七万多人，到一九五二年十一月，就增加到二百一十三万多人。千百万意大利人民拥护着共产党。法国共产党在自己的斗争中取得了越来越多的成就。在法国一九五一年的议会选举中，共产党得到了五百多万票，在全国各党派中占第一位。所有各国的共产党都是争取和平、争取民族独立和民主自由、争取人民的光明未来的斗争的旗手。
