Some Experiences in Organizing Teachers from Our Organization to Intern in Factories
Huadong Chemical Engineering Institute

Huadong Chemical Engineering Institute was established in the autumn of 1952, with ten specialties. At that time, there was a severe shortage of professional teachers, and many professional courses could not be offered. For example, the Glass Specialty had a total of ten professional courses, but only one professional teacher. The leadership of the institute attached great importance to this serious situation and led various departments to actively cultivate professional teachers soon after the start of the semester.

According to the principle of combining theory and practice, the specific method for cultivating professional teachers was to organize teachers to go to factories for a certain period of internship, while also combining it with necessary business theory learning. The internship period ranged from a minimum of three weeks to a maximum of seven or eight weeks. Before the internship, the relevant department heads first contacted the factory to make arrangements, and then notified the teachers going to the factory for internship to prepare: read relevant professional course books to have a preliminary basic concept of the professional course. (This preparation work is necessary not only for teaching assistants who lack professional knowledge and practical work experience, but also for professors with more experience.) After the preparation work is completed, the internship begins at the factory. In the factory, in addition to systematically observing the operation process, it is also necessary to try to consult some of the factory's production data, especially the introduction of advanced Soviet experience. Finally, write an internship report summarizing the gains.

The Department of Inorganic Industry, which had a more serious shortage of professional teachers, organized a total of five factory internships. The results of the internship were, first of all, enriching teachers' production knowledge and improving their professional level, laying a preliminary foundation for teaching professional courses. All the teachers who had been to the factory said that after going to the factory, their theoretical knowledge was consolidated and enhanced, and their professional level was improved. Professor Zhou Zuxun, who taught the silicate specialty course, and Lecturer Shi Yajun, who taught the salt electrolysis specialty course, originally felt unsure about offering professional courses, but after going to the factory, they felt "confident in offering the courses." The factory internship also inspired teachers to further recognize the importance of learning from the Soviet Union. Teachers in the factory had the opportunity to see a lot of Soviet materials. These materials were novel, practical, and correct, which could not be achieved by British and American technical books; at the same time, they also saw how Soviet advanced technology and production experience effectively helped our production and construction. Therefore, some teachers who originally did not fully understand the significance of learning from the Soviet Union and had doubts about Soviet science and technology had a deeper understanding of the advanced nature of Soviet technology after going to the factory. The factory internship also inspired teachers to further recognize the importance of linking theory with practice. The teachers said that the theoretical principles that were very general and principled in the books became concrete and were understood more deeply when they saw and did them in the factory.

The factory internship also strengthened the relationship between the school and the factory and played a certain positive role in the factory's production, while also enabling teachers to clearly establish the idea of teaching serving production. Because the teachers who went to the factory generally had a certain theoretical level, and they had made some preparations before going to the factory, they were able to put forward some suggestions for improving production technology when discussing and studying problems with engineers, and even help the factory solve some problems. For example, Professor Wu Zhigao and Teaching Assistant Zhu Bingchen, who interned at the Zhonghua Acid and Alkali Plant, helped the factory solve the problem of improving the gas ducts of the ore furnace; Teaching Assistant Wu Antai helped the factory improve the analysis method of pyrite—the original barium chloride precipitation method required 36 hours, but now the diamine biphenyl precipitation method only takes 5 to 6 hours (this new method is still being tested by the factory), which greatly shortens the analysis operation process and improves product quality. Because the teachers who go to the factory for internship are helpful to the factory, the factory generally welcomes teachers to the factory for internship. The teachers further clarified that teaching is for the needs of construction and established the idea of serving production during the factory internship.

Organizing teachers to go to the factory for internship is indeed one of the important methods for cultivating and transforming teachers. According to our short-term implementation, we believe that there are several things that must be paid attention to:

First, when organizing teachers to go to the factory, pay attention to good pairing. We generally send two teachers to the factory, one is a teacher above the lecturer level, who has a certain professional level, and the other is a young teaching assistant, who is more active and sensitive to new things. The two complement each other, help each other and cooperate, which can not only improve the professor but also cultivate the teaching assistant. However, in the five factory internships of the Department of Inorganic Industry, there were more teaching assistants and fewer professors, and the professors still play a major role in the current teaching work. Therefore, we believe that more attention should be paid to organizing professors to go to the factory for internship in the future.

Second, the preparation work before going to the factory should be fully prepared, especially the specific purpose and requirements of the factory internship should be fully clarified. We have not done enough in this regard in the past, otherwise, the teachers' gains would be greater.

Third, teachers should not only carefully observe and repeatedly study when they go to the factory, but also personally participate in the operation. Because only by participating in the operation can it be possible to deeply understand the internal relationship of the production process and the problems and key points in production. In the past, we only paid attention to observation and did not pay enough attention to operation, which is inappropriate.

Fourth, we must strive to make the factory attach importance to the factory internship of teachers and obtain close cooperation from the factory. Otherwise, after the teachers go to the factory, the internship effect will be reduced due to the lack of necessary assistance from the factory. On the other hand, teachers who go to the factory must pay attention to not only improving their professional level but also clearly establishing the idea of teaching serving production, and they should also understand the factory's production organization and management, workers' working conditions, and living conditions. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this aspect. The professors said after returning: We did not contact our worker comrades enough.

Finally, the leadership must give full attention to the work of organizing teachers to go to the factory for internship in order to complete it well. At the beginning of the establishment of our institute, there were many tasks and heavy teaching work, and there was a serious shortage of teachers. Under this objective circumstance, the leadership was determined to transfer a group of teachers to the factory for internship. Now it has been proved that this approach not only takes care of the current teaching work but also takes care of the future needs of professional courses, and it should be used in the future.

    我们组织教师下厂实习的点滴经验
    华东化工学院
    华东化工学院于一九五二年秋建校，设立了十个专业，当时专业课师资十分缺乏，有很多的专业课程开不出来。例如玻璃专修科，共有十门专业课程，专业师资仅一人。院的领导方面十分重视这种严重情况，开学不久，就领导各系积极培养专业课师资。
    根据理论和实际结合的方针，培养专业课师资的具体办法是：组织教师下厂进行一定时间的实习，同时结合进行必要的业务理论学习。实习时间，最短的三周，最长的七、八周。实习前，先由有关系主任向工厂接洽妥当，然后通知下厂实习教师进行准备：阅读有关专业课程的书籍，以便对该项专业课程有一个初步的基本概念。（这种准备工作，不但是缺乏专业知识和实际工作经验的助教需要做，就是较有经验的教授也需要做。）准备工作完成后，即下厂实习。在工厂中，除系统地观察操作过程外，还要尽量参阅工厂生产上的一些资料，尤其是苏联先进经验的介绍。最后写出实习报告，总结收获。
    专业师资缺乏情况较为严重的无机工业系共组织了五次下厂实习。实习结果，首先是丰富了教师的生产知识，提高了教师的业务水平，为讲授专业课程初步准备了必要条件。凡是下过厂的教师，都说：到工厂以后，巩固并增进了理论知识，业务水平提高了。讲矽酸盐专业课程的周祖训教授，讲食盐电解专业课程的施亚钧讲师，原来觉得开专业课无甚把握，下厂后便觉得“开课有把握了”。下厂实习还启发教师进一步认识了学习苏联的重要意义。下厂教师在工厂中有机会看到不少苏联资料。这些资料，内容新颖、实用、正确，决不是英美技术书籍所能企及的；同时也看到了，苏联的先进技术和生产经验，是怎样切实有效地帮助了我们的生产建设。因之有些原来对学习苏联的意义认识不足，对苏联科学技术抱有怀疑态度的教师，下厂后对苏联技术的先进性有了较深的体会。下厂实习还启发教师进一步认识到理论联系实际的重要性。教师们都说：原来书本上很笼统很原则性的理论，到厂里一看一做就具体了，领会得更深刻了。
    下厂实习还密切了学校和工厂的关系，并对工厂的生产起了一定的积极作用，同时使教师明确树立了教学为生产服务的思想。由于下厂教师一般都有一定的理论水平，下厂前又进行了一些准备工作，所以在下厂后和工程师讨论研究问题时，能够提出一些改进生产技术的意见，甚至能帮助工厂解决一些问题。譬如在中华酸碱厂实习的吴志高教授、朱炳辰助教，曾帮助工厂解决改良矿炉气道问题；巫安泰助教帮助工厂改进硫铁矿的分析法——原来用氯化钡沉淀法需三十六小时，现在改用二氨联苯沉淀法仅需五至六小时（这种新方法该厂尚在试行），使分析操作过程大大缩短，并且提高了产品质量。由于下厂实习的教师对于工厂有帮助，一般地说，工厂都很欢迎教师下厂实习。而教师则在下厂实习中进一步明确认识了教学是为了建设的需要，并树立了为生产服务的思想。
    组织教师下厂实习，确实是培养和改造师资的重要方法之一。根据我们短时间的实施，我们认为有几件事情须得注意：
    一、组织教师下厂，要注意搭配得好。我们一般是由二个教师下厂，一个是讲师以上的教师，他们有一定业务水平，另一个是青年助教，他们积极性较高，对新事物较敏感。两者取长补短，互助合作，既能提高教授，又能培养助教。但是无机工业系教师的前后五次下厂，助教数量较多，教授较少，而目前在教学工作中起主要作用的还是教授。所以我们认为以后应多注意组织教授下厂实习。
    二、下厂以前，准备工作要做得充分，尤其应充分明确认识下厂实习的具体目的和要求。我们以往在这方面做得不够，不然，教师的收获会更大些。
    三、教师下厂不但要仔细观察，反复研究，而且应亲自参加操作。因为只有参加了操作才有可能深刻认识生产过程的内在关系和生产中存在的问题和关键。以往我们只注意观察，对操作重视不够，这是不妥当的。
    四、要努力促使工厂重视教师下厂实习这件事情，取得工厂密切合作。不然，教师下厂后，因得不到厂方必要协助，便会降低实习效果。另一方面，下厂教师则必须注意下厂实习不但为了提高业务水平，而且应该明确树立教学为生产服务的思想，对工厂的生产组织和管理情况，工人劳动条件、生活情况等也应进行了解。以往对这方面注意得也是不够的，教授们回来后都这么说：我们和工人同志联系不够。
    最后，组织教师下厂实习这一工作，领导方面必须予以充分重视，才能完成得好。我院创办伊始，任务较多，教学工作也较重，而师资严重缺乏。在这种客观情况下，领导方面才下决心抽调一批教师下厂实习。现在证明，这种做法，既照顾了目前的教学工作，也照顾到将来的专业课程需要，今后还应该运用。
