    Prevent and Control Crop Diseases Early
    Plant Protection Division, Central Ministry of Agriculture
    Recently, continuous rain and high humidity in various regions, coupled with abnormal temperature changes, have created favorable conditions for the occurrence of rice blast, cotton stem blight, angular leaf spot, boll rot, potato late blight, tobacco black shank, and Chinese cabbage "bolting" and soft rot. These diseases occurred in 1952, and some caused severe damage. Last year, rice blast spread throughout rice-producing areas nationwide. According to estimates from the Bohai region of Hebei Province alone, it resulted in a loss of approximately 100 million catties of rice. In the southern cotton-growing areas, cotton boll rot caused significant yield reductions last year. Potato late blight was widespread in some areas last year, with a reduction of 350 million catties of potatoes in the Chahar and Suiyuan areas alone. Last year, in tobacco fields severely affected by tobacco black shank, tobacco production losses reached over 80 percent. Chinese cabbage "bolting" and soft rot occurred in the suburbs of major cities in Northeast China, as well as in Beijing, Xi'an, Taiyuan, and other places, causing a reduction of about half of the Chinese cabbage production in these areas, greatly affecting the supply of vegetables to the cities. Currently, cotton stem blight and angular leaf spot have already occurred in various regions, and potato late blight and tobacco black shank are occurring, all of which should be prevented and controlled in a timely manner. Although cotton boll rot, rice blast, and Chinese cabbage diseases have not yet occurred, active prevention measures should also be taken. The following prevention and control methods can be adopted for reference in various regions.
    1. Late application of fertilizer in paddy fields, excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation with cold mountain streams, and premature drainage are all factors contributing to the occurrence of rice blast. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to correcting these improper fertilization and irrigation practices. Where conditions permit, "Bordeaux mixture" can be sprayed during prevention and control (spray a solution of 1 catty of copper sulfate, 2 catties of quicklime, and 200 catties of water during the rice seedling tillering stage, and spray a solution of 1 catty of copper sulfate, 3 catties of quicklime, and 200 catties of water during the booting and heading stages. Add an appropriate amount of adhesive at the same time).
    2. For cotton stem blight and angular leaf spot, the following emergency prevention and control measures should be taken immediately: (1) Spray cotton fields with "Bordeaux mixture" made of 0.5 catty of copper sulfate, 1 catty of quicklime, and 100 catties of water; (2) Carry out "picking off lower leaves" work in a timely manner, and carry the picked leaves, as well as dead plants, withered branches, fallen leaves, etc., out of the field and burn them to reduce transmission; (3) Pay attention to field drainage and weed removal. To prevent cotton boll rot, the focus should be on preventing and controlling pests during the budding and boll stages to reduce damage to the cotton bolls and prevent the invasion of pathogens.
    3. To prevent potato late blight, drainage and earthing up should be promoted. In areas where there is no ditching habit or shallow ditch cultivation, attention should be paid to ditching and drainage. If late blight has already occurred but has not yet spread to the underground parts, the base of the potato plants can be earthed up and compacted (generally earthing up to a height of 4 inches) to prevent pathogens from invading the tubers. If most of the stems and leaves are withered and rotten, they can be cut off completely in advance, collected and composted, and should not be thrown away randomly. Potatoes can be dug 10 to 15 days after the stems and leaves have been cut off. In areas where conditions permit, the "Bordeaux mixture" made of 1 catty of copper sulfate, 12 taels of quicklime, and 100 catties of water can be sprayed at the appropriate time.
    4. Tobacco black shank is mainly spread by the flow of rainwater on the ground, so ditching and drainage is an effective measure to prevent and control this disease. In order to increase the drainage speed, earthing up can also be carried out on the tobacco plants when ditching. Secondly, attention should be paid to inspection, and diseased plants should be removed and burned.
    5. Autumn Chinese cabbage is about to be sown. To prevent the occurrence of "bolting" and soft rot, attention should be paid to: 1. Using decomposed fertilizer as basal fertilizer, or appropriately reducing the amount of basal fertilizer and appropriately increasing the amount of top dressing; 2. Using high-ridge vegetable planting as much as possible; 3. Paying attention to the prevention and control of pests from the time of transplanting to the time of heading to reduce the spread and spread of diseases.

    及早防治作物病害
    中央农业部植物保护司
    近来各地阴雨连绵，湿度较大，再加气温变化不够正常，给稻热病（即稻瘟病），棉花茎枯、角斑、烂铃等病，马铃薯晚疫病，烟草黑胫病，白菜“孤丁”病、软腐病等病害的发生造成了有利条件。这些病害在一九五二年都曾发生，有的为害很重。去年稻热病遍及全国稻产区，仅据河北省渤海区估计，就损失了稻谷约一亿斤。南部棉区去年因棉花烂铃减产甚多。部分地区去年普遍发生马铃薯晚疫病，仅察哈尔、绥远一带就减产马铃薯三亿五千万斤。去年烟草黑胫病为害严重的烟田，损失烟产达百分之八十以上。白菜“孤丁”病（即抽疯病）与软腐病曾在东北各大城市郊区以及北京、西安、太原等地发生，使这些地方的白菜减产约一半以上，大大地影响了城市蔬菜的供应。目前棉花茎枯病与角斑病已在各地发生，马铃薯晚疫病和烟草黑胫病正在发生，都应及时防治。棉铃腐烂、稻热病及白菜病害虽然还没有发生，但也应积极预防。下列几种防治办法，可供各地参考采用。
    一、稻田追肥过晚，施用氮肥过多，浇灌山涧冷水和落干过早，都是发生稻热病的因素。因此，必须注意纠正这些施肥和灌溉不当的现象。有条件的地区，在防治中可以喷洒“波尔多液”（稻秧分蘖期喷洒一斤硫酸铜、二斤生石灰、二百斤水配制的药液，孕穗和齐穗期喷洒一斤硫酸铜、三斤生石灰、二百斤水配制的药液。同时加适量粘着剂）。
    二、对棉花茎枯病和角斑病，当前应采取如下紧急防除措施：（1）棉田喷洒硫酸铜半市斤、生石灰一市斤、水一百市斤配制成的“波尔多液”；（2）及时进行“采裤腿”工作，并将采下的叶片及田间的枯株、败枝、落叶等携出田外烧毁，以减少传染；（3）注意田间排水及清除杂草。预防棉铃腐烂，主要应抓紧防除蕾铃期的害虫，以减少棉铃的损伤，防止病菌侵入。
    三、防治马铃薯晚疫病，应该提倡排水和培土。凡无开沟习惯或浅沟栽培的地区，应注意开沟排水。如晚疫病已经发生而尚未蔓延至地下部分时，可在薯株基部培土并压紧（一般培土高四寸），以防病菌侵入薯块。如茎叶大部枯烂，可提早全部割下，收集起来沤粪，不要随便乱扔。茎叶割下后十至十五天再行挖薯。在有条件地区，可掌握适当时期，喷洒硫酸铜一市斤、生石灰十二市两、水一百市斤配制成的“波尔多液”药剂。
    四、烟草黑胫病主要是藉地面雨水的流动而传播的，所以开沟排水是防治这种病害的有效措施。为了增强排水速度，还可以在开沟时对烟株进行培土。其次，应注意检查，将病株拔除烧掉。
    五、秋白菜即将播种，为预防“孤丁”病与软腐病的发生，应注意：1、采用腐熟肥料作基肥，或酌减基肥施用量，适当增加追肥量；2、尽量采用高畦栽菜；3、定栽后至结球期间，注意防除害虫，以减轻病害的传播和蔓延。
