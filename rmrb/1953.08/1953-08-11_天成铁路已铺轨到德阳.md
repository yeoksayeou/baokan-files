Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The Tiancheng Railway tracks, laid from Chengdu, were extended approximately 22 kilometers beyond Guanghan in July, reaching Deyang Station on August 1st.

    Since July, rainfall in the western Sichuan Plain has suddenly increased, making the track-laying work from Guanghan to Deyang much more difficult than before. However, because the workers rationally adjusted the organization of labor, learned the Soviet method of track-laying assembly line operation, and improved the auxiliary bridge-building machine, work efficiency was greatly improved.

    天成铁路已铺轨到德阳
    据新华社讯：从成都铺起的天成铁路的铁轨，七月份又由广汉向前延伸了约二十二公里，八月一日铺到了德阳车站。
    七月以来，川西平原的雨量突然增加，使广汉到德阳的铺轨工作比以前困难得多。但是职工们因为合理地调整了劳动组织，学习了苏联的铺轨流水作业法，改进了辅助架桥机，所以工作效率仍大有提高。
