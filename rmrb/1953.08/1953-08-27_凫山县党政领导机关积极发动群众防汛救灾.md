    Fushan County Party and Government Leading Organs Actively Mobilize the Masses for Flood Prevention and Disaster Relief
    Letter from Li Depu, Fushan County People's Government, Shandong Province: Fushan County is traversed by the Bai Ma River, Si River, Wangyun River, Jing River, Shi Xiang River and other rivers. Since July 24th, there have been continuous heavy rains, and floods have broken out. The Jing River and Shi Xiang River embankments could not withstand the fierce scouring of the mountain torrents, and there were multiple breaches causing disasters. In Xin'an, Gaicun, and Yangzhuang townships, near Nanyang Lake, large boats can travel on the flat ground; in Wangchao, Liuzhuang, Shuimozhuang, and Niu Ji townships in the tenth district, the water is more than one meter deep on the flat ground.

    In view of the above situation, the county's Party and government leading organs held a meeting and decided that five members of the county party committee, as well as the county head and the more responsible cadres from various sections and bureaus of the county people's government, should go to various flood-stricken areas to mobilize cadres and the masses to carry out dam construction, embankment restoration, drainage, and seedling rescue work according to different circumstances. The Second District mobilized 500 workers from July 25th and within three days, repaired 15 breaches and reinforced the dikes. In addition, they built 359 meters of mountain dams, ensuring that more than 50,000 mu of large autumn crops were protected from further flooding.

    In Wangyun Village, Second District, after the floodwaters receded, more than 500 mu of soybeans were knocked down into the silt. The masses believed that there was no hope for the autumn harvest, and their pessimistic thinking was very serious. The county flood control work team immediately convened farmers to study rescue methods. They mobilized the masses to dig small drainage ditches to drain the stagnant water from the fields, prop up the fallen soybeans, and brush off the mud on the seedlings in the morning when there was dew; and if necessary, wash them with water. In this way, the whole village rescued 169 mu of soybeans and 48 mu of sweet potatoes. Subsequently, all districts and townships in the county learned and adopted this method. For the areas that had already been damaged by the flood, the masses were mobilized to rush to plant buckwheat.

    In addition, the county leaders also helped the disaster victims near the lakes (Dushan Lake, Nanyang Lake) solve the difficulties of fishing tools, and called on everyone to go to the lake to fish when the lake water rises and there are many fish in the lake, in order to exchange grain to solve the difficulties in production.

    凫山县党政领导机关积极发动群众防汛救灾
    山东凫山县人民政府李德普来信：凫山县有白马河、泗河、望云河、荆河、石祥河等河流横贯县境。七月二十四日以来，连降大雨，洪水暴发，荆河、石祥河堤防经不起山洪猛力冲刷，有多处决口成灾。靠近南阳湖的新安、盖村、杨庄三乡，平地能行大船；十区王晁、刘庄、水磨庄、牛集等乡，平地水深一公尺多。
    鉴于上述情况，该县党政领导机关开会决定，由县委委员五人以及县长和县人民政府各科、局比较负责的干部分赴各水灾区动员干部和群众根据不同情况进行打坝、复堤、排水、救苗等工作。二区从七月二十五日起动员民工五百人，在三天内堵修决口十五处，并加固了堤坝，另外又修好山坝三百五十九公尺，保证了五万多亩大秋作物避免再受水灾。
    二区望云村在洪水下退后有五百多亩豆子被冲倒在淤泥里，群众认为秋收已无希望，消极思想很严重。县防汛工作组马上召集农民研究抢救办法。动员群众挖小型的顺水沟把地里的积水排出去，把冲倒的豆子扶起来，乘着早晨有露水时把豆苗上的泥浆摆掉；必要时则用水泼洗。这样，全村抢救出豆子一百六十九亩，地瓜四十八亩。接着全县各区乡也都学习和采用了这个办法。对于已经被水冲坏的地方，则发动群众赶种荞麦。
    此外，县领导方面又帮助靠湖（独山湖、南阳湖）灾民解决了捕鱼工具的困难，号召大家乘湖水上涨、湖里鱼多的时候下湖捕鱼，以便换粮食来解决生产中的困难。
