    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st—The Korean-Chinese side has made full preparations in terms of material supplies and cultural life for the Korean-Chinese captured personnel who are about to be repatriated.
    Because the Korean-Chinese captured personnel have suffered greatly damaged health due to long periods of starvation and humiliation in the US POW camps, the Korean-Chinese side has specially prepared ample meat, eggs, seafood, as well as vegetables and sugar and other non-staple foods for them. The temporary hospitals have also specially prepared a large amount of milk powder, milk, fruit and various palatable side dishes for the sick and wounded captured personnel who are about to return, and have custom-made cakes and other foods for the severely ill and seriously wounded captured personnel. After each captured person is repatriated, they can receive brand-new cotton quilts, sheets, military blankets, unlined garments, shirts, as well as shoes, hats, socks and other daily necessities. In addition, each person can also receive a cloth-made comfort bag, on which are printed in bright red in Korean and Chinese the words: "The people of the motherland are caring for you." The bag is filled with towels, handkerchiefs, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, notebooks, pencils and other supplies and cigarettes.
    The captured personnel from our side who return to the embrace of the motherland will enjoy a full cultural and recreational life during their stay in Kaesong. The cultural and artistic groups and students in Kaesong City are rehearsing song and dance programs to be performed at welcome parties. In addition, three Korean cultural and artistic groups and three literary and art work troupes of the Chinese People's Volunteers will arrive in Kaesong one after another in the near future. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have also organized ten mobile film projection teams so that our captured personnel, who have been separated from the motherland for a long time, can first see the new face of the motherland and the growth and strength of the forces of peace in the films. The Korean-Chinese side has also transported a large number of books, newspapers and magazines, and other necessary cultural and recreational supplies are being transported to Kaesong one after another.

    我方为即将归来的被俘人员作好充分准备
    【新华社开城一日电】朝中方面已经为即将遣返归来的朝中被俘人员在物质供应和文化生活方面作了充分准备。
    由于朝中被俘人员在美方战俘营中过了长期饥饿的和受凌辱的生活，健康已遭到极大的损害，朝中方面特为他们准备了充足的肉类、鸡蛋、海味以及菜蔬、白糖等副食品。各临时医院还特地为即将归来的病伤被俘人员准备了大批奶粉、牛乳、水果和各种可口的小菜，并且为重病和重伤被俘人员定制蛋糕等食品。每一被俘人员遣返回来后就可以领到崭新的棉被、被单、军毯、单衣、衬衣以及鞋、帽、袜子等日常需要的东西。此外，每人还可领到一只布制的慰问袋，袋上分别用朝鲜文和中文印着鲜红的大字：“祖国人民在关怀着你们。”袋里满装着毛巾、手帕、牙刷、牙膏、肥皂、笔记本、铅笔等用品和纸烟。
    重回祖国怀抱的我方被俘人员在开城停留期间，并将享受到充分的文化娱乐生活。开城市的各文化艺术团体和学生们，正在排演欢迎会上演出的歌舞节目。另外，还有三个朝鲜文化艺术团体和志愿军的三个文艺工作团，都将在最近陆续到达开城。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并已组织了十个流动电影放映队，使长期与祖国隔离的我方被俘人员，可以首先在影片中看到祖国的新面貌以及和平力量的增长和壮大。朝中方面并已运来大批书报杂志，其他必需的文化娱乐用品也正陆续运来开城。
