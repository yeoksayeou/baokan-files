Many textile factories across the country have seen a transformation in the lax state of labor discipline and a significant increase in attendance rates after conducting in-depth education to strengthen labor discipline.

The state-owned Shanghai No. 15 Cotton Textile Factory began educating workers in June by "settling accounts carefully" (calculating the losses to the country caused by absenteeism) and comparing life before and after liberation. Appropriate punishments were also given to workers who consistently violated labor discipline and repeatedly refused to correct their behavior after education. After this education, the workers recognized that not abiding by labor discipline was a shameful act and consciously formulated rules, reducing the absenteeism rate by half. After conducting labor discipline education, the state-owned Shanghai No. 12 Cotton Textile Factory also greatly reduced instances of unexcused absences. In addition to conducting labor discipline education for all employees, the factory's trade union, considering the characteristics of textile factories having many female workers with heavy family burdens, cooperated with the administration to open a nursery station that could accommodate more than fifty children, enabling female workers to have sufficient sleep and concentrate on production. In addition, they also established a stomach disease cafeteria, changed the medical consultation system, and assisted the safety technology section in adding eighty-three types of safety devices, greatly reducing absenteeism and work-related injuries. The trade union and administration of the state-owned Qingdao No. 7 Cotton Textile Factory jointly organized a labor discipline inspection team, carried out administrative actions against workers who consistently violated labor discipline, and the trade union chairman and factory director reviewed at the workers' congress their bureaucratic attitude of irresponsibly abandoning leadership and turning a blind eye to the laxity of labor discipline, calling on everyone to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to examine the phenomenon of lax labor discipline. After this education, absenteeism was basically eliminated, and the attendance rate in June increased by 3.19% compared to May. At the same time, output and quality also improved. In various state-owned cotton textile factories in Tianjin, due to the implementation of education to consolidate labor discipline and the improvement of safety, hygiene, and workers' welfare, the attendance rate of each factory increased by more than 5%. At the same time, it also reduced overtime work and the phenomenon of unbalanced semi-finished product supply. The state-owned Handan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, while strengthening labor discipline education, also lowered the workshop temperature, adjusted housing, increased the attendance rate, and ensured the completion of monthly and quarterly production plans. The Shanghai Joint State-Private New Light Underwear Factory, after carrying out education to strengthen labor discipline, not only eliminated absenteeism, but also increased the rate of first-class cloth to over 92%, exceeding the planned target. In Tianjin's private Hengyuan and Dasheng factories, after conducting education through criticism and self-criticism and using advanced examples to motivate the backward, the Hengyuan yarn factory increased its attendance rate to 95% in June, and the first-class cloth rate of the cloth workshop increased from 82.5% to 85%. Dasheng yarn factory's total output in May exceeded the original plan by 8.25%. At the same time, the labor conditions of both factories have also been greatly improved. (Shao Hua)

    全国许多纺织工厂
    加强劳动纪律教育以后出现新气象
    全国许多纺织工厂在进行深入的加强劳动纪律教育后，劳动纪律松弛情况有了转变，出勤率有了显著提高。
    国营上海第十五棉纺织厂，六月份开始用算细账
    （计算缺勤对国家造成的损失）的办法，对比解放前后生活，向工人进行教育；对那些一贯违犯劳动纪律、而且屡教不改的工人，也给了适当处分。通过这些教育后，工人都认识到不遵守劳动纪律是可耻的行为，自觉地订了制度，缺勤率降低了一半。国营上海第十二棉纺织厂进行了劳动纪律教育后，无故缺勤现象亦大大减少。该厂工会除了向全厂职工进行劳动纪律教育外，并根据纺织厂女工多家庭牵累多的特点，配合行政开办了能容五十多个孩子的托儿站，使女工能有充分的睡眠时间，能安心生产。此外，又举办了胃病食堂，改变了诊病制度，协助安全技术科增添了安全装置八十三种，使缺勤和工伤事故大大减少。国营青岛第七棉纺织厂工会和行政共同组织了劳动纪律检查组，对一贯破坏劳动纪律的工人进行了行政处理，工会主席和厂长在职工大会上检讨了对劳动纪律松弛采取熟视无睹的不负责任的放弃领导的官僚主义的态度，号召大家用批评与自我批评的武器，检查劳动纪律松弛的现象。通过这些教育后，旷工基本上没有了，六月份出勤率比五月份提高了百分之三点一九。同时产量和质量也有了提高。天津各国营棉纺织厂，由于进行了巩固劳动纪律教育，并改进了安全卫生和工人生活福利后，各厂出勤率提高了百分之五以上，同时，也减少了加班加点和半成品供应失调的现象。国营邯郸第一棉纺织厂，与加强劳动纪律教育的同时，降低了车间温度，调整了住房，提高了出勤率，保证了按月按季完成生产计划。上海公私合营新光内衣厂，进行加强劳动纪律的教育后，不但消灭了旷工现象，而且正布率提高到百分之九十二以上，超过了计划指标。天津私营恒源、达生两厂，通过批评与自我批评、用先进带动落后的办法进行教育后，恒源纱厂六月份出勤率提高百分之九十五，布场正布率由百分之八二点五提高到百分之八十五。达生纱厂五月份总产量超过原计划百分之八点二五，同时该两厂在劳动条件上，也有了很大改善。    （邵华）
