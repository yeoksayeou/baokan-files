    Earnestly Carry Out the Autumn Grain Procurement Work
    In China's rice-producing areas, early rice has generally entered the market, and mid-season rice is also starting to be harvested. Autumn grain procurement work has entered a tense stage.
    Early rice in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Sichuan and other provinces has had a bumper harvest. Early rice in the lake area of Hunan province is growing well, with a 10% increase in production compared to last year. The harvest volume of early rice in Jiangxi province may increase by 5% to 7% compared to last year. The purchase price of rice has also been increased compared to last year, according to the cotton-grain price ratio already announced by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council. In order to strengthen the supply of materials to grain-producing areas, state-owned commercial and cooperative departments are actively opening up sources of goods. These are all favorable conditions for this year's autumn grain procurement work. However, it must also be recognized that: due to the gradual improvement of the living conditions of the vast number of farmers in China, the demand for grain among farmers is increasing day by day. In addition, in some areas, production materials and living materials were not supplied to farmers in a timely manner during this year's wheat procurement work. These situations will bring difficulties to the autumn grain procurement work. Therefore, the task of procuring autumn grain this year is still arduous, and it is necessary to organize forces well, correctly implement various economic measures in accordance with the state's price policy and procurement plan, carry out necessary political work among farmers, and fully utilize favorable conditions to launch procurement work in a timely manner.
    In order to quickly and effectively launch early rice procurement work, the following issues also need to be paid attention to:
    First, formulate practical procurement plans. In this year's wheat procurement work, some areas had inaccurate estimates of production conditions, overestimates of disaster severity, and underestimates of yields. They failed to conduct in-depth investigations into the extent of wheat production reduction, and failed to recognize the good situation of disaster relief, rapid production recovery, and disaster improvement under the leadership of local party and government officials. As a result, the plans were too small, which brought many difficulties to warehousing and transportation, fund allocation, scheduling plans, supply, and other work, putting the work in a passive position. This lesson must be learned in the autumn grain procurement work. State-owned grain departments in various regions should regularly pay attention to the weather, climate, and the growth of grain crops, understand the true situation of disasters and post-disaster production recovery, and market changes. They should cooperate with relevant departments to conduct in-depth investigations, study the changing rural economic situation in various regions at different times, and accurately formulate procurement plans, and take appropriate and feasible management measures. Because the size of the planned targets is related to the quality of the procurement work, the amount of procurement, the degree of effort in the procurement work, and the progress of the overall work.
    Second, correctly implement the price policy. In grasping regional price differences, reasonable regional price differences should be formulated with reference to the historical circulation patterns of grain and the new production and sales circulation situation this year. In the wheat procurement work, some practices, such as one price per county regardless of production and sales circulation, or the same price for several counties, or prices in rural areas being higher than in cities, or leveling the production and sales areas, or very small price differences, have caused price inconsistencies between urban and rural areas, and between production and sales areas, affecting the market to a certain extent, stifling the natural adjustment and circulation of grain, fueling farmers' reluctance to sell and their wait-and-see mentality, and increasing the state's passivity and unnecessary losses in scheduling. This must be corrected.
    At the beginning of procurement, list prices should be fully displayed at once, and the principle of pricing according to grade, pricing according to quality, higher prices for higher quality, grading according to quality, and pricing according to grade, and accepting both good and inferior grain should be resolutely implemented. Pay attention to improving the purity of grain, reducing the content of impurities and gravel, in order to encourage farmers to sell good grain and get good prices. Resolutely prevent the phenomenon of downgrading and price suppression to the masses and disguised upgrading and price increases that do not meet the prescribed standards. State-owned grain departments and cooperatives should make preparations for grading work as soon as possible. In terms of grading methods, efforts should be made to be simple, easy to understand, fair and reasonable, or to publicize standards and display samples to facilitate farmers' sales.
    Third, actively organize the supply of materials. In the wheat procurement work, some areas neglected to organize the supply of materials to rural areas, which affected the smooth progress of wheat procurement work. After farmers sell grain in the autumn, their need for means of production and means of livelihood is more urgent than at any other time of the year, and the quantity required is also very large. The supply of materials is even more important. The quality of this work will directly affect the progress of autumn grain procurement work. Therefore, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in various regions should pay attention to investigating and understanding the specific types, specifications, and quality of goods needed by farmers in various regions, actively open up sources of goods, vigorously prepare industrial products, handicraft products, and applied agricultural implements, and supply farmers' needs in a timely manner. Promote methods such as bringing goods to the countryside and ordering goods according to samples, mobile procurement, and facilitating farmers. At the same time, under the unified leadership of the local party and government, banks, tax and other departments should pay attention to timely coordination of the work of currency issuance and withdrawal.
    To do a good job in grain procurement, it is also necessary to resolutely rely on the leadership of local party and government departments, and under the unified leadership of the local financial and economic committees, absorb commercial, banking, grain, cooperative, tax and other departments, closely connect with and strengthen the leadership of rice procurement work. State-owned grain departments and cooperatives should, on the basis of wheat procurement, further strengthen cooperation and appropriate division of labor, expand the scope of procurement points, and strive to overfulfill the state's procurement tasks. At the same time, it is also necessary to do a good job in the allocation and use plan of funds, to ensure that there is grain and money, neither to accumulate funds, nor to occur out-of-purchase, to meet the requirements of farmers to sell grain. The procedures for weighing and paying in the procurement process should be simplified as much as possible. Both retail and bulk purchases should be made, and purchases should be made as soon as they arrive to facilitate farmers. The management of the grain market and transportation management should also be strengthened.
    In addition, it is also necessary to pay special attention to carrying out necessary political work among farmers, extensively, deeply and regularly explaining to farmers the party and government's comprehensive policy of developing rural production, pointing out to farmers that selling grain is also an important link in supporting urban industrial construction, enlivening the urban and rural economy, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, which is consistent with the current and long-term interests of farmers, and mobilizing farmers to sell surplus grain to add livestock and farm implements to improve and expand reproduction and increase grain production. However, it should be noted that this kind of educational work should be carried out in combination with daily work, and should not be rushed. Strict prevention of the phenomenon of coercion and command is necessary.

    认真地做好秋粮收购工作
    我国产稻区的早稻已普遍上市，各地中稻也开始收割，秋粮收购工作已进入紧张阶段。
    广东、福建、浙江、四川等省早稻获得丰收，湖南滨湖区早稻生长良好，比去年增产一成。江西省的早稻收获量，可比去年增产百分之五至七。稻米的收购价格，根据中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会已公布的棉粮比价，也已比去年有所提高。为了加强粮区的物资供应，国营商业、合作社部门已在积极开辟货源。这些都是今年秋粮收购工作的有利条件。但是，也必须认识到：由于我国广大农民生活条件的逐渐改善，农民对于粮食的需要量日益增多，加以今年小麦收购工作中，部分地区没有及时供应农民生产资料和生活资料，这些情况，又将带来秋粮收购工作的困难。因此，今年收购秋粮的任务还是艰巨的，必须很好的组织力量，依照国家的价格政策和收购计划，正确贯彻各项经济措施和对农民进行必要的政治工作，充分运用有利条件及时展开收购工作。
    为了迅速地有效地展开早稻收购工作，还需要注意如下几个问题：
    第一，订立切实的收购计划。今年小麦收购工作中，有些地区对生产情况的估计不确实，对灾情估计过重，对产量估计过低，没有深入调查小麦减产程度，没有认识到经过各地党政领导救灾，迅速恢复生产及灾情的好转等情况，以致所订计划偏小，从而给仓储运输、资金拨付、调度计划、供应等工作带来很多困难，使工作陷于被动。在秋粮收购工作中必须接受这一教训。各地国营粮食部门，应该经常关心天时、气候和粮谷作物的生长情况，了解灾害及经过救灾后的生产真实情况和市场的变化情况，配合有关部门深入调查，研究各地不同时期的变化着的农村经济情况等等，确切地拟定收购计划，并采取适当可行的经营措施。因为计划指标确定的大小，关系收购工作的好坏、收购数量的大小、收购工作的努力程度及全盘工作的进度。
    第二，正确的执行价格政策。在地区差价掌握上，应该参照粮食的历史流转规律和今年新的产销流转情况，拟定合理的地区差价。在小麦收购工作中，有的不分产销流转情况的一县一价、或数县同价，有的乡高于城，产销区间拉平，或者差价很小的作法，曾引起城乡之间、产销区之间价格不协调，影响市场一定程度的混乱，窒息了粮食的自然调剂与流转，助长了农民的惜售看涨心理，加重了国家在调度上的被动和不必要的赔累，这是必须纠正的。
    在开始收购时，应将牌价一次挂足，并坚决贯彻分等论价，依质论价，优质优价，按质分等，按级给价，好次都收的原则。注意提高粮食纯度，减少含杂砂石，以鼓励农民售好粮、得好价。坚决防止向群众压级压价和不按照规定标准的变相提级提价的现象发生。国营粮食部门与合作社均应及早作好评级工作的准备。在评级方式上，应力求简明易晓，公平合理，或公布标准，摆出样品，便利农民出售。
    第三，积极组织物资供应工作。在小麦收购工作中，部分地区忽视组织农村物资供应工作，影响了收购小麦工作的顺利进行。秋季农民出售粮食后，对生产资料和生活资料的需要，在一年内比之任何时候都迫切，需要的数量也很大，物资供应工作也更加重要，这一工作做的好坏，将直接影响秋粮收购工作的进展。因此，各地国营商业部门、合作社应注意调查和了解各地农民具体需要的商品品种、规格和质量，积极开辟货源，大力准备工业品、手工业品和应用农具，及时供应农民需要。发扬带货下乡、按货样订货等办法，流动收购，便利农民。同时，银行、税收等部门，在当地党政统一领导下，应注意及时配合货币的投放与回笼的工作。
    要做好粮食收购工作，还须坚决依靠各地党政的领导，在各地财政经济委员会的统一领导下，吸收商业、银行、粮食、合作、税收等部门，密切联系并加强对稻米收购工作的领导。国营粮食部门和合作社，应在收购小麦的基础上，更进一步的密切合作与适当分工，扩大收购点面，争取国家收购任务的超额完成。同时，还须做好资金调配使用计划，做到有粮有款，既不积压资金，又不发生脱购，满足农民售粮要求。对于收购过程中的过秤、付款等手续应力求简化，应该零整都收，随到随收，便利农民。对于粮食市场的管理和运输管理也应加强。
    此外，还应该特别重视对农民进行必要的政治工作，广泛的深入的经常的向农民解释党和政府发展农村生产的全面政策，向农民指出，出售粮食也是支持城市工业建设，活跃城乡经济，巩固工农联盟的重要环节之一，与农民的当前利益和长远利益是一致的，动员农民出售余粮，用以添置牲畜、农具，以改进和扩大再生产，增加粮食产量。但应该注意，这种教育工作，应结合在日常工作中去进行，不能操之过急，要严防强迫命令的现象发生。
