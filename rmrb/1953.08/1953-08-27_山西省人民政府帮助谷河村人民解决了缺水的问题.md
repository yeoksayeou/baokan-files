    The Shanxi Provincial People's Government Helps Guhe Village Solve Water Shortage
    Comrade Lu Picheng of the Kela County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party writes: Guhe Village in the third district of Kela County, Shanxi Province, is a village in the old revolutionary base area in the mountains, with a total of 34 households. In the past, this village suffered from water shortage for generations. Although the villagers had dug many wells and spent a lot of money, they were unsuccessful. The whole village had to transport water from a place called Sanjing, which was five miles away from the village. In the old society, the people of Sanjing often did not allow them to fetch water, so they had to transport water from a deep ditch twenty miles away from the village. During the rainy season, the people of Guhe Village also built dams in the ditch to collect water, but the water source was small, and the water was polluted and smelly due to livestock trampling. Moreover, whenever there was a drought, Zhaizi Village upstream (which also lacked water) would build dams to block their water source, so the people of the two villages often fought over water issues.
    After the establishment of the People's Government, the people of Guhe Village were no longer blocked from fetching water from Sanjing; however, transporting water still took a lot of effort. The whole village needed an average of eight laborers a day to spend on transporting water, which delayed agricultural production. The difficulty was even greater when the weather was dry.
    In order to help the people of the old revolutionary base area solve the problem of water use, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government sent technicians in 1951 to survey the well-drilling site for the people of Guhe Village. However, because they had failed to find water after digging wells many times in the past, everyone lacked confidence in digging wells. Under the repeated mobilization of the Party organization, they finally reached a consensus. This spring, they began to raise funds to drill wells. After digging more than ten zhang deep, they still did not see water, and the money raised in the village was also used up. So some people lost confidence again and advocated stopping work immediately. At this time, Comrade Gao Yongfeng, a member of the Party branch, encouraged everyone on the one hand, and asked the government for help on the other. The government learned about the village's well-drilling situation and believed that there could be water if they continued to dig. It then loaned the village one million yuan and mobilized the villagers to continue the well-drilling project. A few days later, the well was dug deeper, and spring water gushed out as expected. The water shortage that the people of Guhe Village had been unable to solve for generations was fundamentally solved, and the whole village was as happy as if they were celebrating a happy event.

### 山西省人民政府帮助谷河村人民解决了缺水的问题

    山西省人民政府帮助谷河村人民解决了缺水的问题
    中共岢岚县委员会路丕承同志来信：山西岢岚三区谷河村，是山区革命老根据地中的一个村庄，全村共三十四户。过去，这个村子世世代代都缺水用，虽然该村人民曾经打过很多次井，花了许多钱，但都没有结果。全村吃水要到离村五里远的一个叫三井地方去驮运；在旧社会，三井群众还常不让他们打水，他们只好到离村二十里远的深沟去驮运。雨季时，谷河村的人们也在沟内堵坝集水，但水源很小，加上牲口糟踏，积水污臭难吃。而且每逢天旱，上游的寨子村（和他们一样缺水）就筑起坝子把他们的水路挡住了，所以两村人民经常因为水的问题发生斗殴。
    人民政府成立后，谷河村人民到三井去驮水不再受阻挡了；可是运水还是要化费很多工夫，全村平均每天需要八个劳动力花在运水上，这就耽误了农业生产。天气干旱时，困难更大。
    为了帮助老根据地人民解决用水的问题，一九五一年山西省人民政府派来了技术人员，给谷河村人民勘测了打井地址。但是，因为过去多次打井都没见水，所以大家对挖井缺乏信心。在党组织一再动员下，才算取得了一致意见。今年春天，开始集资打井，打了十余丈深还不见水，同时村里集起的钱也花完了，于是有人又失掉了信心，主张立即停工。这时，党支部委员高永峰同志一面鼓励大家，一面请示政府要求帮助。政府了解了该村打井情况，认为打下去可以有水，就给该村贷款一百万元，动员该村人民把打井工程继续下去。过了几天，井挖得深了，泉水果然冒了出来。谷河村世世代代解决不了的吃水困难得到了根本解决，全村人民高兴得像办喜事一样。
