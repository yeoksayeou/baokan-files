Xinhua News Agency:

    Farmers in North China are working intensively on weeding, fertilizing, and pest control to strive for a bumper harvest of autumn crops.

    This year, autumn crops in Hebei and Shanxi provinces are growing well. In the plains areas, millet is over four feet tall, corn and sorghum have already tasseled, and cotton plants are gradually blooming. The recent thorough rains in the relatively dry Suiyuan province are also beneficial for crop growth.

    Since the beginning of summer, farmers in North China have been actively weeding, fertilizing, and controlling pests to increase grain production. Autumn fields throughout the region have generally been weeded once or twice, and some in the suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin have been weeded four times. In more than ten counties in Shanxi Province, such as Zuoquan, Pingshun, and Jiaocheng, some agricultural production cooperatives have adopted the form of work teams to implement short-term "contract work," which has improved labor efficiency. The Gao Zhenhou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Rian Village, Jiaocheng County, weeded 375 mu of autumn fields planted with millet, yams, and beans more than ten days earlier than ordinary farmers.

    The amount of fertilizer applied this year is generally higher than last year in various places. In the plains areas of Hebei Province, 2,000 to 2,200 jin of fertilizer are applied per mu, and in the mountainous areas, it reaches 3,000 jin per mu, an increase of about 20% compared to previous years. In eight counties and eleven districts of the Zhangjiakou Special District, according to incomplete statistics, more than 100,000 mu have been top-dressed in the summer. In Qinyuan, Changzhi, and other eight counties in Shanxi Province, the average amount of top-dressing per mu has increased by more than three dan compared to last year. In the fight against insect pests, leadership departments at all levels promptly issued instructions for emergency pest control and organized cadres to go to the countryside to help farmers control pests. More than 560,000 mu of land in Hebei Province has been completely cleared of locust nymphs. An'guo and Wuji counties have made progress in controlling cotton aphids. According to statistics from 131 townships, more than 5,000 farmers have been mobilized to control aphids on more than 77,000 mu of land, of which more than 2,000 mu have been treated twice, and some have been treated four times. In Huguan County, Shanxi Province, thanks to the leadership's attention, insect pests were completely eliminated within six days of their occurrence.

    华北农民紧张进行锄草施肥治虫等工作
    华北各地农民为争取大秋作物丰收，正紧张地进行锄草、施肥、治虫等工作。
    今年河北、山西两省大秋作物生长良好，平原地区谷子高在四尺以上，玉米、高粱已经吐穗，棉株也已逐渐开花。比较干旱的绥远省各地最近也落了透雨，有利作物生长。
    入夏以来，华北各地农民为了增产粮食，都积极锄草、施肥、治虫。全区秋田一般已锄过一遍至二遍，北京、天津郊区有的更锄了四遍。山西省左权、平顺、交城等十余县有一部分农业生产合作社采用工作队的形式，实行短期“包工”，提高了劳动效率，交城县日岸村高振厚农业生产合作社比一般农民提前十几天就将谷子、山药、豆类等三百七十五亩秋田锄过一遍。
    各地今年施肥量普遍比去年增多。河北省平原地区每亩施肥二千斤到二千二百斤，山区每亩达三千斤，约比往年增加百分之二十。张家口专区八个县十一个区，据不完全统计夏季已追肥十万多亩。山西省沁源、长治等八县平均每亩比去年增施追肥三担以上。在与虫害斗争中，各级领导部门及时发出紧急防除虫害的指示，并组织干部下乡帮助农民治虫。河北省五十六万多亩土地上的蝗蝻已全部消灭。安国、无极四县治棉蚜虫已有进展，据一百三十一个乡统计，已发动农民五千多人，治蚜七万七千多亩，其中有二千多亩治过二次，有的治过四次。山西省壶关县由于领导方面重视，虫害在发生后六天内就被全部消灭。（新华社）
