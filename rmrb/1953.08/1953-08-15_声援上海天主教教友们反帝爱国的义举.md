    Resolutely Support the Patriotic and Anti-Imperialist Righteous Actions of Shanghai's Catholic Faithful
    Wang Liangzuo, Catholic Priest of Guangyuan County, Sichuan

    After seeing the news in the People's Daily on July 16 about imperialist elements using Catholicism to conduct espionage activities, I felt indescribable anger in my heart. This is a great insult to our sacred church by imperialist elements. The cracking of these two espionage cases by the resourceful public security personnel of the People's Government has dealt another heavy blow to the imperialist elements. Imperialist elements led by Tian Wanglin, Lin Ren, Zhai Guanghua, Fei Youwen, Ge Shouping, and others used Catholicism as their shield to conduct espionage activities, probing into our country's political, economic, and other secrets, transmitting them to foreign intelligence agencies in code. These testimonies and material evidence make me see more clearly: the imperialists are definitely not reconciled to their failure in China, and they are still making a desperate struggle.

    I recall that in 1950 and early 1951, when our patriotic Catholics in Guangyuan County initiated the patriotic reform movement, imperialist elements An Langru and Du Ming threatened us with accusations of "apostasy and schism." Now, Catholic priests and faithful across the country have launched a patriotic and anti-imperialist struggle; however, there are still a few priests and faithful who lack clear understanding and are still being used by imperialist elements, thus enabling imperialist elements to continue engaging in criminal activities that harm the people and the motherland under the guise of religion. We should realize that these imperialist elements are the enemies of our people, that is, the enemies of our patriotic and church-loving priests and faithful, and also the enemies of our Catholic Church. In the past, these imperialist elements in religious garb said, "There are no imperialist elements within Catholicism," "Catholicism is supra-political and supra-national," and "has no relationship with imperialism." They attempted to use these words to cover up their aggressive conspiracies, attempting to alienate the feelings between our patriotic priests, faithful, and the People's Government. However, every kind-hearted member of the church and patriotic priest, who has not seen the new China in the nearly four years since liberation, under the leadership of our wise leader Chairman Mao, in which aspect is it not completely new? The Common Program clearly stipulates that religious belief is free and is also protected. If imperialist elements and their running dogs use religion for aggressive activities, we must resolutely stop them together with the people of the whole country and give them a heavy blow.

    We deeply know that true religious freedom can only be obtained under the people's own government. We must always be vigilant, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, stand on the position of loving the motherland and loving the people, be determined, and wage a firm and merciless struggle against imperialism and its running dogs. This is the only correct way out for us Catholics. Looking back before liberation, our country was in a semi-colonial state, and in our church, almost all the power was in the hands of imperialist elements hanging the names of bishops and priests. They thought that we Chinese were "incompetent," while they thought of themselves as "heaven's chosen." They believed that Chinese people could not manage the church and treated us as puppets, who could only obey orders. After liberation, we stood up together with the people of the whole country, and Chairman Mao freed us from the chains of imperialism, and we were free. Facts have proved that we are capable of managing the church ourselves.

    Therefore, I agree with, I respond to, and I support the righteous actions of the Catholic faithful in Shanghai. I want to unite closely with them, unite with the patriotic and church-loving faithful all over the country, launch an uncompromising struggle against those imperialist elements who have been hiding in Catholicism for a long time, completely crush any aggressive conspiracies of the imperialist elements, and defend the purity of our holy church. Patriotic and church-loving Catholics, let us resolutely throw ourselves into the anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle.

    声援上海天主教教友们反帝爱国的义举
    四川广元县天主教神甫  王良佐
    我看到七月十六日人民日报登载的帝国主义分子利用天主教进行间谍特务活动的消息后，内心里有着说不出的愤恨。这是帝国主义分子对我们圣洁的教会的一个莫大污辱。人民政府机智的公安人员对这两个间谍特务案的破获，给了帝国主义分子又一次沉重的打击。以田望霖、林仁、翟光华、斐有文、格寿平等为首的帝国主义分子们，用天主教作他们的护身符，进行间谍活动，刺探我国家的政治、经济等各方面的机密，用密码传给外国特务机关。这些人证、物证使我更加看清了：帝国主义是决不甘心于他们在中国的失败的，他们还在作垂死的挣扎。
    我回想起，一九五○年和一九五一年初，当我们广元县的爱国天主教徒发起革新爱国运动以后，帝国主义分子安朗如、杜明曾以“叛教、裂教”相威胁。现在全国各地的天主教神长和教友们已经展开了反帝爱国的斗争；可是也仍有少数神长和教友认识不清，还在被帝国主义分子利用，因而帝国主义分子得以继续在宗教的外衣下，进行危害人民和祖国的罪恶勾当。我们应该认识到，这些帝国主义分子，就是我们人民的敌人，也就是我们爱国爱教的神长和教友们的敌人，也就是我们天主教会的敌人。过去，这些披着宗教外衣的帝国主义分子说，“天主教内是没有帝国主义分子的”，“天主教是超政治、超国际的”，“与帝国主义无关系”。他们企图用这些话来掩护他们的侵略阴谋，企图离间我们爱国神长、教友与人民政府之间的情感。可是，我们每一个善良的教友和爱国的神长，谁没有看到解放将近四年来的新中国，在我们英明的领袖毛主席的领导下，那一方面不是焕然一新呢？共同纲领明文规定：宗教信仰是自由的，而且还加以保护。帝国主义分子及其走狗，如果利用宗教作侵略活动，我们一定要和全国人民一道坚决加以制止，并给予他们以沉重的打击。
    我们深知，真正的宗教信仰自由，要在人民自己的政权下才能获得。我们必须时时提高警惕，分清敌我，站在爱祖国爱人民的立场上，下定决心，同帝国主义及其走狗作坚决无情的斗争。这是我们教友的唯一正确的出路。回想解放以前，我们国家处在一个半殖民地的地位，我们教会很少不是一切大权都操在挂着主教神甫名义的帝国主义分子的手中。他们认为我们中国人“无能”，而他们却自以为是“天之骄子”。他们认为中国人不能办理教会，把我们当作木偶，只能唯命是从。解放后，我们和全国人民一道站起来了，毛主席给我们解脱了帝国主义加在我们身上的锁链，我们自由了。事实证明，我们是能自己办理教会的。
    所以，我同意、我响应、我拥护上海市天主教教友们的义举。我要和他们亲密地团结起来，和全国各地爱国爱教的教友们团结起来，向那些长期隐藏在天主教内的帝国主义分子展开毫不妥协的斗争，彻底粉碎帝国主义分子的任何侵略阴谋，保卫我们圣教会的纯洁。爱国爱教的教友们，让我们坚决投入反帝爱国的斗争中。
