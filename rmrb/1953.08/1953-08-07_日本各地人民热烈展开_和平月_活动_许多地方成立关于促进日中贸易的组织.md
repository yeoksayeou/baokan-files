The Fourth National Congress of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, held from July 8th to 11th, decided to take the struggle against military bases as one of the guiding principles of future movements and passed a resolution supporting the struggle against the Uchinada Village military base. On July 19th, in Kanazawa City, Ishikawa Prefecture, a conference of Japanese people against military bases to support the people of Uchinada Village was held, initiated by the Japan Teachers Union, etc. Shiga Prefecture is scheduled to hold a prefectural people's conference against military bases on July 26th, and Aichi Prefecture is scheduled to hold one in mid-August.
