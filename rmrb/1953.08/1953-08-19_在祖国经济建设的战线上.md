    On the Frontline of National Economic Construction
    Chongqing Builds New High-Voltage Power Grid
    Chongqing is currently constructing a new high-voltage power grid. This high-voltage power grid project began in 1952 and is scheduled to be completed in 1954. In 1952, a portion of the high-voltage power grid project was completed, including four substations and 61 kilometers of high-voltage lines. In 1953, plans are in place to complete five substations and 51 kilometers of high-voltage lines. This will essentially form a unified high-voltage power grid in the Chongqing urban area. In 1954, in addition to continuing the completion of high-voltage lines in the Chongqing urban area, the high-voltage grid will also extend to areas tens of kilometers away from the Chongqing urban area. The completion of the Chongqing urban area high-voltage power grid will further ensure the quality and safety of industrial electricity consumption in Chongqing. In the past, Chongqing's lines were branched and forked, unable to form a cyclical system grid; when a line malfunctioned or was under repair, it often resulted in power outages over large areas. After the power grid is built, the lines will be connected, and power outages can be avoided. Because the transmission voltage in Chongqing was too low in the past, electricity could not be transmitted far, and the amount of electricity was also small, often causing dim lights and machines unable to move in peripheral areas. These phenomena can be eliminated after the power grid is built. At the same time, the strong power generated by the 507 Power Plant, which will generate electricity in March and April 1954, can also be transmitted through this high-voltage power grid to the wide and distant heavy and light industrial areas distributed throughout the city. In order to cooperate with the new 507 Power Plant's power transmission, the Third Engineering Team of the Southwest Electric Power Administration Engineering Company, which is responsible for the line engineering, is working actively to complete and overfulfill this year's tasks.
    Gansu Province Completes Four of Nine Highways Constructed in Minority Areas
    Gansu Province is newly building and renovating nine highways in minority areas this year, of which four highways have been completed, and the other five highways are currently under intensive construction. These nine highways are a total of 1,300 kilometers long. The four completed highways are from Lanzhou to Langmu Temple, Xiahe to Aba in northwestern Sichuan, Minxian to Xiahe, and Tianshui to Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous Region, totaling 628 kilometers. Among the new line projects, the 157-kilometer project from Jingning to Xiji, Haiyuan, and Guyuan Hui areas has now completed 25 percent of the entire project. Of the 58 kilometers from Lintao Zhongbao via Dongxiang Autonomous Region Suonanba to Linxia, 180,000 cubic meters of earthwork and the bridge foundation projects for two large bridges on the Daxia River are about to be completed. The 57-kilometer project from Yongdeng to Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region has now started. Other renovation projects from Pingliang to Huai County and from Minxian to Wudu, totaling more than 400 kilometers, have also completed 35 to 45 percent of the entire project. These highway projects are very arduous, some in plateau gully areas, some in grasslands and desert areas. All highways have received enthusiastic support and assistance from the local people of all ethnic groups during construction. Now, in areas where highways have been completed, people of all ethnic groups can buy various daily necessities newly transported to the area.
    Yunnan Province Increases Salt Production
    The salt production of the fourteen state-owned salt fields in Yunnan Province this year has increased by more than 40 percent compared with last year, which can fully supply the needs of people of all ethnic groups in the province for edible salt.
    Yunnan Province has very rich salt reserves, but during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, even the people of all ethnic groups living around the salt areas had difficulty eating salt, and the vast number of ethnic minority people suffered from a long-term bland diet. After liberation, this situation gradually changed, and both the output and quality of salt have greatly improved. The people's government has also implemented price reduction and tax reduction and exemption policies for the people of all ethnic minorities in the border areas. In the past, it took seven kilograms of rice to exchange for one kilogram of salt in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, but now it generally takes just over one kilogram of rice to exchange for one kilogram of salt. The supply has also gradually increased. For example, the supply in the second quarter of this year in Weixi County, where Tibetans, Lisu, and Yi people live together, increased by more than 1,500 dan compared with the first quarter. At present, salt supply and marketing organizations have been established in the vast majority of counties in the province. The provincial Salt Affairs Bureau has also successively established more than 100 distribution points and a large number of mobile sales teams in remote ethnic minority areas and mountainous areas such as Honghe, Jinping, Weixi, Bijiang, and Lancang.
    In order to welcome the arrival of the autumn harvest season, state-owned salt industry organizations and cooperatives in various places have prepared more than 170,000 dan of salt to supply the people of all ethnic groups, and a large number of mules and horses and vehicles have been organized to start transporting the salt. The Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau has also prepared a batch of edible salt to supply to the ethnic minorities in Guizhou and Xikang.
    Zhejiang Province Expands and Builds Four Tea Factories
    The Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China Tea Industry Company is actively preparing to produce large quantities of various high-quality varieties of green tea that are loved by people at home and abroad. This year, three tea factories are being expanded. A newly built, relatively large tea factory is already installing machinery and can start production in mid-August.
    These expanded and newly built tea factories will use electric machinery for production. They will refine large quantities of "Mei"-shaped green tea, which is loved by the people of the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies, pearl tea, which is particularly needed by countries in North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia, as well as Longjing and Xiangpian tea, which are loved by the people of the country. The common characteristics of these teas are green color, clear fragrance, and delicious taste, which can help digestion and eliminate fatigue. After these several expanded and newly built tea factories are completed, they will produce 200,000 dan of various high-quality refined teas this year, expanding the supply to meet the needs of people at home and abroad.
    Shanghai Public-Private Jointly Operated Printing and Dyeing Factories Will Produce a Large Number of Printed Cloths Loved by Farmers
    Eighty percent of the dozens of kinds of dark-colored printed cloths produced by Shanghai's state-owned printing and dyeing factories for autumn and winter are supplied to rural areas across the country. According to the needs of farmers, many new patterns of printed cloths will be produced in August and September, including "Rural Happiness," "Hundred Children," "Hundred Birds," and "Squirrel Grape." "Rural Happiness" vividly depicts the scene of a bumper harvest in the countryside; on the modern "Hundred Children" picture, chubby and lovely children are joyfully jumping between thatched huts and bamboo fences surrounded by chickens, ducks, geese, dogs, and flowers; the "Hundred Birds" picture, full of joy, features patterns familiar to farmers such as magpies chirping on plum blossoms, phoenixes about to fly, floating duckweed with mandarin ducks, and peacocks, pigeons, and sparrows. This type of printed cloth is specially for farmers to make quilt covers. Small-flower printed cloths suitable for women and children to wear and black cloth, more than eighty percent of which is sold in rural areas, are also being produced in large quantities.
    In order to meet the needs of farmers, workers in various state-owned printing and dyeing factories are actively overcoming difficulties to improve the quality of printed cloth.
    At present, the printed cloths with purple-red and bright red backgrounds, which are sold in large quantities in rural areas, have completely adopted wash-resistant and sun-resistant dyes for printing and dyeing. Many factories have overcome the shortcoming of greening in black serge, which is loved by elderly farmers, and this problem will be completely eliminated in the third quarter. The state-owned Shanghai First Printing and Dyeing Factory is printing and dyeing the new pattern "Rural Happiness" printed cloth, and the workers are very interested in this pattern. They believe that farmers will be very satisfied. Private printing and dyeing factories will also conduct experiments according to the new quality standards. Some workers in private factories, in order not to let bad cloth be sold as good cloth and cause farmers to suffer losses, have established inspection teams to carefully check the quality of the products leaving the factory.

    在祖国经济建设的战线上
    重庆市建设新的高压输电网
    目前重庆市正在建设一个新的高压输电网。这个高压输电网工程，从一九五二年开始，计划到一九五四年全部完成。一九五二年已完成一部分高压输电网工程，包括四个变电站和六十一公里的高压线路。一九五三年计划作好五个变电站和五十一公里的高压线路。这样，就使重庆市区基本上形成一个统一的高压输电网。一九五四年，除继续完成重庆市区的高压线路外，高压电网并将扩展到离重庆城区几十公里以外。重庆市区高压输电网的完成将使重庆市区工业用电的质量和安全得到进一步保证。过去重庆线路分枝分叉，不能形成一个循环往复的系统电网；遇到线路发生故障或检修时，就常形成大片区域停电。在电网建成之后，条条线路，脉脉通连，停电现象就可以避免。由于过去重庆输电电压太低，以致电输不远，电量也小，并且常使边缘区域电灯不明和发生机器推不动等现象。这个电网建成以后，这些现象就可以消灭。同时一九五四年三、四月发电的五○七电力厂所发出来的强大电力，也可通过这个高压电网，输送到分布全市又宽又远的、重、轻工业区。为了配合新建五○七电力厂输电，担任线路工程的西南电业管理局工程公司第三工程队，正在积极工作，以完成与超额完成今年的任务。
    甘肃省在少数民族地区修筑的九条公路已有四条完成
    甘肃省今年在少数民族地区新修和整修的九条公路，其中有四条公路的工程已经完工，其他五条公路目前正在紧张施工。这九条公路共长一千三百公里。已经完成的四条公路有兰州到郎木寺、夏河到四川西北阿坝、岷县到夏河、天水到张家川回族自治区共长六百二十八公里。新线工程中，由静宁到西吉、海原、固原回族地区的一百五十七公里的工程，现在已完成全部工程的百分之二十五。由临洮中堡经东乡自治区锁南坝到临夏的五十八公里内的十八万土方工程，大夏河上两座大桥的桥基工程即将完成。由永登到天祝藏族自治区的五十七公里的工程现在已经动工。其他由平凉到怀县、由岷县到武都共长四百多公里的整修工程，也都完成全部工程的百分之三十五到四十五。这些公路工程都非常艰巨，有的在高原沟壑区，有的在草原和沙漠地区。各条公路在修建中都得到当地各族人民的热烈支持和援助。现在，凡公路已修好的地区，各族人民已能在当地买到新运去的各种日用品。
    云南省盐产量提高
    云南省十四个国营盐场今年盐的产量比去年增加了百分之四十以上，可以充分供应省内各族人民对于食盐的需要。
    云南省盐的蕴藏量十分丰富，但在国民党反动统治时期，即使居住在盐区周围的各族人民也很难吃到盐，广大少数民族人民都曾受过长年淡食的痛苦。解放以后，这种情况逐渐改变，盐的产量和质量都大为提高，人民政府并对边疆各少数民族人民实行减价和减税免税政策；过去西双版纳傣族自治区要七斤米换一斤盐，现在一般是一斤多米就可换到一斤盐了。供应量也逐渐增多，如藏族、傈僳族、彝族杂居的维西县，今年第二季度的供应量就比第一季度增加了一千五百多担。现在全省绝大多数县份都已设立了盐的供销机构，该省盐务管理局还先后在红河、金屏、维西、碧江、澜沧等边远少数民族地区和山区，设立了一百多个分销处和大批流动的推销组。
    为迎接秋收旺季的到来，各地国营盐业机构、合作社已准备了十七多万担盐供应各族人民，现已组织大批骡马和车辆开始调运。省盐务管理局并已准备了一批食盐供应给贵州和西康的少数民族人民。
    浙江省扩建和新建四座茶厂
    中国茶业公司浙江省公司正在积极准备大量生产国内外人民所喜爱的各种优良品种的绿茶。今年有三座茶厂正在扩建。一个新建的规模比较大的茶厂已经在安装机器，八月中旬就可以开始生产。
    这些扩建和新建的茶厂将完全运用电动机械生产。它们将精制大量为苏联和东欧各人民民主国家人民所喜爱的“眉”字形的绿茶，为北非洲、中东和中央亚细亚等国家所特别需要的珠茶，以及国内人民所爱好的龙井和香片等茶。这些茶品的共同特点是色绿、清香可口，能够帮助消化和消除疲劳。这几个扩建和新建的茶厂完工以后，今年将生产出二十万担各种优良品种的精制茶，扩大供应国内外人民的需要。
    上海公私营印染厂将生产大批为农民所喜的花布
    上海市国营印染厂所生产的几十种秋冬季深色花布，百分之八十是供应全国农村的。他们根据农民的需要，八九月份将生产许多花样新颖的花布，其中有农家乐、百子图、百鸟图、松鼠葡萄图等。农家乐生动地表现了农村的丰收景象；现代百子图上，肥胖可爱的孩子们在鸡、鸭、鹅、狗和花草围绕的茅屋竹篱间欢乐跳跃；洋溢着喜气的百鸟图上，有喜鹊闹梅、凤凰欲飞、浮萍鸳鸯和孔雀、鸽子、麻雀等农民熟识的图案，这类花布是专供农民做被面用的。适于妇女小孩穿的小花花布和百分之八十以上销行农村的黑布，也正在大量生产中。
    各国营印染厂职工为了满足农民需要，正在积极克服困难提高花布的质量。
    目前，大量销行农村的紫红、大红地子的印花布，已经完全采用耐洗、耐晒的染料来印染；老年农民爱穿的黑色线哔叽，许多厂已克服了泛绿的缺点，第三季度将全部消灭这一毛病。国营上海第一印染厂正在印染新图样农家乐的花布，工人们对这种花样很感兴趣，他们认为农民一定会很满意。私营印染厂也将根据新的质量标准进行试验，有些私营厂的工人们为了不让坏布充好布卖出去使农民吃亏，已成立了检查小组，认真检查出厂产品的质量。（新华社）
