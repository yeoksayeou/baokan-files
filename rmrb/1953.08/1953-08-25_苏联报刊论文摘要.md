    Urgent Tasks of Industry
    The "Pravda" published an editorial on August 11th entitled "Urgent Tasks of Industry," pointing out the significance of increasing labor productivity and further reducing product costs for ensuring the development of light industry and the food industry. The abstract is as follows:

    As everyone knows, the Communist Party began our socialist industrialization by developing heavy industry - metallurgy, fuel and power industries, especially the machine-building industry, which plays a decisive role in the development of all socialist economies. Thanks to the Party's wise policy, we now have a strong, technically perfect heavy industry. At present, about 70 percent of all industrial workers work in heavy industry. The means of production they produce account for about 70 percent of all industrial products.

    Our country will continue to devote all its efforts to developing heavy industry - the foundation of the socialist economic base. We must always remember that the development of heavy industry is the key to further improving light industry, increasing agricultural productivity, and consolidating the national defense of our socialist motherland.

    Simultaneous with the development of heavy industry, our light industry and food industry have developed, and the production of daily necessities has increased. However, until now, we have not had the opportunity to develop light industry at the same speed as heavy industry. In the past twenty-eight years, the production of means of production has increased about fifty-four times, while the production of daily necessities has only increased eleven times.

    The situation has now changed. Based on the victories already achieved in the development of heavy industry, we have all the conditions to rapidly increase the production of consumer goods.

    The urgent task is to greatly increase the supply of food and manufactured goods to the people within two or three years, so that every city and every rural area can buy all the necessary commodities. Therefore, it is necessary to shift to the production of daily necessities, and it is necessary to ensure that light industry and the food industry can develop more rapidly.

    At the same time, we should pay attention not to be satisfied only with the increase in the production of consumer goods. The quality of all manufactured products for consumption is also very important.

    The staff of socialist industry face the serious task of improving the material welfare of the Soviet people. In order to successfully solve this task, we must raise all our economic and organizational work to a new and higher level.

    However, as pointed out at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the ministries and local party organizations and Soviet organs have not satisfactorily implemented the directives of the Party Congress, and have not taken the necessary measures to eliminate these shortcomings and improve the leadership of enterprises.

    Our neglect of the cost problem, which is the basic indicator of all enterprise work, has not been eliminated. Many factories and mines are still operating at a loss. The value of the products they produce exceeds the stipulated price of the commodity. Loss-making enterprises live off advanced enterprises, and they undermine the foundation of economic accounting in industry. In some enterprises, the task of increasing labor productivity has not been completed.

    In the coal mining industry and the timber industry, many enterprises have not completed the task of reducing product costs and increasing labor productivity for many years.

    The urgent task of the Party and trade union organizations is to resolutely fight for the increase of labor productivity and the further reduction of product costs.

    Careful Calculation and Budgeting
    The "Pravda" published an editorial on August 8th, pointing out the great significance of the economy system under the circumstance that heavy industry has won the victory. The abstract is as follows:

    The economy system under the socialist system is absolutely indispensable. All the working people care about it, because they do not work for the exploiters, but for themselves and for the society.

    Now our national economy shows a new and vigorous upsurge, the prices of daily necessities are gradually reduced, and agricultural taxes and other taxes are reduced, so the economy system has a greater significance. The more fully and rationally we use the production resources, the more carefully and accurately we manage, the greater achievements we can achieve in developing all national economic sectors, and the greater results we can receive in improving the material and cultural level of the people's lives.

    Further consolidate the economic accounting system, abide by the strictest economy system. Mobilizing the accumulated resources within the economy and other issues have become the focus of attention of all representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. From the speeches at the conference, we can see that although major achievements have been made in mobilizing and correctly using the internal potential of the national economy, there are still some major shortcomings in this important matter, and we still have some enterprises that are not working satisfactorily, and even some national economic sectors, which have not completed the production plan and the task of reducing product costs, and there is a large amount of waste.

    Last year, coal companies paid 180 million rubles less to the state, and this year the payment plan to the state has not been completed well. This is because many mines in the Coal Industry Department have not implemented the production plan and the task of reducing product costs, condoning waste, and insufficient use of first-class technology.

    Some enterprises have phenomena that violate the product cost plan. Some economic leaders cause damage to the country due to being driven by narrow departmentalism, and they artificially create "reserve forces" when compiling the product cost plan.

    The economy system is implemented the worst in construction projects. For example, the various institutions of the Construction Department do not reduce the budget fee, but instead condone the increase in construction costs. The main reason for the increase in construction costs is due to the failure to make good use of machines, the existence of serious shortcomings in labor organization, the uneconomical attitude towards materials, and the huge overhead expenses.

    All of these prove that some of our economic leaders have forgotten the economy system and have not cared about the rational and economical use of state funds. And the Party organization did not make these leaders correct their work style.

    Timeliness is an Important Characteristic of Newspapers
    "Pravda" published a newspaper review on June 15th, pointing out that timeliness is an important characteristic of newspapers. The abstract is as follows:

    How eagerly do readers expect a new newspaper! The newspaper with the smell of ink still emanating brings new situations in the lives of various republics, border areas, and states, national events, and foreign affairs. But how annoyed should readers be if the people already know about outdated things, and problems that are not problems are published on the newspaper?

    The speech of the newspaper, according to its most fundamental nature, should be timely. The newspaper should be in the lead, and delay is incompatible with the work of the newspaper.

    The state newspaper "Black Sea Commune" in the state of Odessa wrote many articles on timeliness. In those editorials, the editorial department did not call on the Party, the Soviet, and the economic staff to "lead efficiently," "take measures quickly and timely," and "support initiatives in a timely manner"; but instead complained that people "lack efficiency," "did not estimate the urgency of time," and so on.

    But if the editorial department checks how efficient its guidance on the life of the state is, what conclusion will happen? They will probably remember a lot of correspondence, which you can hardly say is written in a timely manner; they will also remember a lot of papers, the problems touched on in which have lost their sharpness; and there are also many short messages reporting some outdated things.

    Naturally, this newspaper has achievements. For example, it timely raised the issue of increasing vegetable production, actively and combatively discussed the issue of utilizing potential, set up a column of "finding, exploring, and utilizing potential", and published articles by enterprise leaders and production innovators...

    However, this newspaper lags behind life in many aspects, and it appears very slow in elaborating the most important issues.

    The comrades of the "Black Sea Commune" newspaper may not dare to say with certainty that the papers they published on the preparation for harvesting, summer feeding of livestock, and mowing work were timely. The editorial on the preparation for harvesting was not published until the end of May. At that time, according to the newspaper, "many districts of Odessa were carrying out the preparation for harvesting, especially the repair of combine harvesters, in a very unsatisfactory manner." But it would have been of great benefit if the newspaper had raised the demand of "immediately take all measures..." earlier.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    工业的迫切任务
    “真理报”八月十一日发表以“工业的迫切任务”
    为题的社论，指出提高劳动生产率和进一步降低产品
    成本对于保证轻工业和食品工业发展的意义，摘要如
    下：
    大家知道，共产党是以发展重工业——冶金、燃料和动力工业，特别是在一切社会主义经济发展中起决定作用的机器制造业来开始我国社会主义工业化的。由于党的英明的政策，我们现在有了强大的，技术上完美的重工业。目前，在全体产业工人中，约有百分之七十是在重工业工作的。他们所生产出来的生产资料产量约占全部工业品的百分之七十。
    我国今后仍将全力发展重工业——社会主义经济基础的基础。我们应当永远记着，重工业的发展是进一步提高轻工业、提高农业生产力和巩固我们社会主义祖国国防力的关键。
    和重工业发展同时，我们的轻工业和食品工业发展起来了，日用品增加了。但是，一直到现在为止，我们还没有机会以和发展重工业同样的速度来发展轻工业。在过去二十八年中，生产资料的生产量约增加了五十四倍，日用品的生产量只增加了十一倍。
    现在情况改变了。在重工业发展已获得的胜利基础上，我们已有一切条件来迅速提高消费品生产量。
    迫切的任务是要在两三年内大大地增加供应给人民的食品和制成品，使每一个城市、每一个农村都能买到一切必要的商品，因此就必须转到生产日用品方面，而且要保证轻工业和食品工业得以更迅速地发展。
    同时我们应当注意，决不能仅仅满足于消费品生产量的提高。供消费用的一切制成品的质量问题也很重要。
    在社会主义工业的工作人员面前有提高苏联人民物质福利的严重任务。为要顺利解决这个任务，必须把我们全部经济和组织工作提高到新的，更高的水平之上。
    但是，正如苏联最高苏维埃会议上所指出的，各部和各地方党组织和苏维埃机关没有令人满意地执行党的代表大会的指令，没有采取消灭这些缺点和改善企业领导的应有的措施。
    我们对于作为一切企业工作基本指标的成本问题的轻视态度还没有消灭。许多工厂和矿场仍是亏本。它们生产出来的产品价值超过该商品规定的价格。亏本的企业靠着先进的企业来过活，它们破坏了工业中的经济核算的基础。在某些企业里还没有完成提高劳动生产率的任务。
    在煤矿工业和木材工业里有许多企业多年来都没有完成降低产品成本和提高劳动生产率的任务。
    党和工会组织的迫切任务就是坚决为提高劳动生产率和进一步降低产品成本而斗争。
    精打细算地来经营
    “真理报”八月八日发表社论，指出节约制度在重工业发展已获得胜利情况下的重大意义。摘要如下：
    社会主义制度下的节约制度是绝对不可缺少的。所有的劳动人民都关心它，因为他们不是为剥削者而工作，却是为自己，为社会。
    现在我国国民经济显出了新的有力高涨，日用品逐次减低了价格，农业税和其他税收减少了，节约制度就具有更重大的意义。我们愈是充分和合理地使用生产资源，我们愈能精打细算地来经营，在发展一切国民经济部门方面我们也愈能获得重大的成就，在提高人民生活的物质和文化水平方面，我们愈能收到重大的成果。
    进一步巩固经济核算制，遵守最严格的节约制度。动员经济内部的积累资源等问题，成为苏联最高苏维埃所有代表们的注意中心。从大会上的演说中我们可以看出，尽管在动员和正确使用国民经济内部潜力方面获得了重大成就，可是在这件重要的事情上仍有一些重大的缺点，我们仍有一些工作得不能令人满意的企业，甚至一些国民经济部门，它们没有完成生产计划和降低产品成本的任务，并且有着大量浪费的现象。
    去年煤业企业少付给国家一亿八千万卢布，而且今年对国家的支付计划完成得不好。这就是因为在煤业部里许多矿场没有执行生产计划和降低产品成本计划的任务，纵容浪费，对头等技术使用不够的缘故。
    有些企业里有破坏产品成本计划的现象。某些经济领导者由于受狭隘的本位主义的驱使而造成对国家的损害，他们在编制产品成本计划时人为地创造了“后备力量”。
    节约制度在建筑工程方面执行得最坏。例如建造部的各个机构不去降低预算费反而纵容建筑费用的提高。建筑成本上涨的主要原因，就是由于没有很好地使用机器、在劳动组织中存在着严重的缺点，以非经济的态度对待物资，以及杂费开支的庞大。
    所有这些都证明了我们有些经济领导者忘记了节约制度，没有关心合理地和节约地支用国家的资金。而党组织也没有使这些领导者改正自己的作风。
    时效性是报纸的重要特性
    “真理报”六月十五日发表一篇报纸述评，指出时效性是报纸的重要特性，摘要如下：
    读者对于新到的一份报纸，期望得多么殷切！油墨气味还在散发的报纸带来了各个共和国、边疆区、州的生活方面的新情况，国家大事和国外事情。可是如果是人们早已知道的、过时的事情，不成问题的问题刊载在报面上，读者该感到多么烦恼呀？
    报纸的言论，按其最根本的性质来说，应当是有时效性的。报纸应当走在前面，迟误是同报纸工作不相容的。
    敖德萨州的州报“黑海公社”写了很多论时效性的文章。编辑部在那些社论中间，不是号召党、苏维埃、经济工作人员“有效率地进行领导”，“迅速及时地采取措施”，“适时地支持倡议”；就是埋怨人们“缺乏效率”，“没有估计到时间的急迫性”以及其他等等。
    但是如果编辑部检查一下自己对本州生活的指导作用究竟有多大效率，那会发生什么结论呢？他们大概会记起很多通讯，这些通讯无论如何你很难说它们是写得很及时；他们也会记起很多论文，其中所触及的问题已失去了尖锐性；另外还有许多短讯报道的是一些早已过时的事情。
    自然，这个报纸是有成绩的。例如它及时地提出了增加蔬菜生产的问题，主动地、富于战斗性地讨论了利用潜力的问题，设立了“寻找、发掘和利用潜力”的专栏，刊载了企业领导人、生产革新者的文章……
    但是，这个报纸却在很多方面落在生活后面，它在阐述最重要的问题时显得很迟钝。
    “黑海公社”报的同志未必敢肯定地说，他们所发表的有关准备收割、夏季饲养家畜和割草工作的论文是有时效性的吧。关于准备收割工作的社论五月末才见报。当时，根据该报所说，“敖德萨的很多区对于收割准备工作，特别是对于联合收割机的修理工作，进行得很难令人满意”。可是如果该报早些提出“立刻采取一切办法……”的要求，那就会有很大的好处。
