    Letter from Luo Shengjiao's Father to the Families of the Korean People's Army
    After hearing the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, Luo Diekai, father of the immortal internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, wrote a letter to the families of the Korean People's Army on July 28, expressing his warm congratulations and condolences to the Korean people. The original letter is as follows:
    Families of the Korean People's Army: I am very happy to hear the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This is a great victory for the Chinese and Korean people in their struggle against aggression and in defense of peace. In this war against American imperialist aggression, which has lasted for more than three years, you, like me, have dedicated your beloved sons and daughters; they have shown the most resolute and courageous spirit on the front lines of the fight against aggression and in defense of peace. It is because of their heroic struggle that the flames of aggression have been stopped, and the victory of signing the Korean Armistice Agreement has been achieved. They have not disappointed our expectations, and we are honored and respected for raising such children. Since my son Luo Shengjiao sacrificed himself, I have received thousands of letters from the Korean people and the people of our country, all expressing their respect and condolences to me. Many young men and women in our country call me "Dear Father" in their letters. One letter read: "You have lost a biological son, but all the young people who are fighting to defend the motherland and defend peace are your children, and they will love and care for you as they would their own father." These letters touched me very much and made me deeply feel that millions upon millions of people are supporting us and supporting our struggle for peace.
    I am an ordinary farmer. I love my son, and I love my country and land. After liberation, like other farmers, I lived a happy and prosperous life under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. However, American imperialism does not allow us to live such a good life. They attempt to annex the entire Korean Peninsula and further invade China. When the American invading army approached the Yalu River, our border, in October 1950, my son Shengjiao responded to the call to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country by joining the Chinese People's Volunteers to fight in Korea. After Shengjiao arrived in Korea, he wrote to me several times, saying, "I swear I will not return home until the American aggressors are driven out and Korea gains freedom and peace!" Now that the Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed, Shengjiao's wish before his death has been initially realized, and this can be a consolation to him.
    After my son Shengjiao sacrificed himself, the Korean people buried him in the land of your heroic country as if he were their own son. I am deeply grateful to you, and our blood-and-flesh friendship is unbreakable. I care about your battles and lives every day, and I care about the victory news of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. After the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, I am also concerned about your efforts to heal the wounds of war and rebuild your homes. I can assure you that the Chinese people, who have fought alongside you for more than three years to combat American aggressors, will continue to support your struggle as they have in the past. Your victory is our victory. I believe that under the leadership of your great leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, and with the efforts of you and the entire Korean people, you will surely be able to completely heal the war wounds suffered by your motherland.
    The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is also a crushing defeat for American imperialism and its running dog, Syngman Rhee. However, the American warmongers and the Syngman Rhee clique are not reconciled, and they are still conspiring to undermine the Korean Armistice. Therefore, we must be a hundred times more vigilant and prepare to use double the strength to counter all their conspiracies and tricks. Those who have exchanged the blood and flesh of their children for peace understand how precious peace is and know how to defend it.

    罗盛教烈士的父亲给朝鲜人民军家属的信
    不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教烈士的父亲罗迭开听到朝鲜停战协定签字的消息后，于七月二十八日写了一封信给朝鲜人民军的家属，对朝鲜人民表示热烈的祝贺和慰问。原信如下：
    朝鲜人民军的家属们：我听到朝鲜停战协定签订的消息后，感到非常高兴。这是朝中人民反对侵略、保卫和平斗争的伟大胜利。在这场坚持了三年多的反对美帝国主义侵略的战争里，你们跟我一样，献出了自己的心爱的儿女；他们在反对侵略、保卫和平的最前线，表现了最坚决最勇敢的精神。正因为他们的英勇的斗争，才制止了侵略的凶焰，取得了签订朝鲜停战协定的胜利。他们没有辜负我们的期望，我们也因为抚育了这样的儿女而获得光荣和尊敬。自从我的儿子罗盛教牺牲后，我接到了朝鲜人民和我国人民的数千封来信，这些来信都向我表示尊敬和慰问。我国许多青年男女的来信中，都称我做“亲爱的爸爸”，有一封来信中写道：“你老人家失掉了一个亲生的儿子，但是所有的为保卫祖国、保卫和平而斗争的青年，都是你的儿女，他们会像爱护自己的父亲一样来爱护您。”这些来信使我非常感动，使我深深地感到千千万万的人都在支持我们，支持我们为和平事业而斗争。
    我是一个普通的农民，我爱我的儿子，也爱我的国家和土地。解放以后，我和其他的农民一样，在中国共产党和中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，过着幸福丰裕的生活。但是，美帝国主义不让我们过这样的好生活，他们妄图并吞整个朝鲜，进一步侵犯中国。当一九五零年十月，美国侵略军队逼近我国国境鸭绿江边时，我的儿子盛教响应抗美援朝、保家卫国的号召，参加了中国人民志愿军赴朝作战。盛教到了朝鲜后，曾几次写信告诉我说：“不赶走美国侵略者，不使朝鲜获得自由和平誓不回家！”现在朝鲜停战协定已经签字，盛教生前的愿望已经初步达到，这是可以告慰于他的。
    我的儿子盛教牺牲后，朝鲜人民把他当作亲生儿子一样安葬在你们英雄国家的土地里。我深深地感激你们，我和你们血肉相连的友谊是牢不可破的。我天天关心着你们的战斗和生活，关心着中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的胜利消息。朝鲜停战协定签订以后，我又关心你们医治战争的创伤和重建家园的努力。我可以向你们保证：三年多来与你们并肩一起打击美国侵略者的中国人民，一定会像过去一样继续支援你们的斗争。你们的胜利也就是我们的胜利。我相信：在你们伟大的领袖金日成元帅领导下，在你们和全朝鲜人民的努力下，一定会把你们的祖国所遭受的战争创伤完全医治好的。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订也就是美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚的惨重失败。但是，美国的好战分子和李承晚集团还不甘心，他们还在阴谋破坏朝鲜停战。因此，我们必须百倍地提高警惕，准备以双倍的力量来回击他们的一切阴谋诡计。曾用自己儿女的血肉换来和平的人，是懂得和平是怎样可贵的，是懂得怎样保卫和平的。    （新华社）
