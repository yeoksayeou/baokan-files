    Do a good job of deep plowing and early plowing of wheat fields to lay a good foundation for increasing wheat production next year

    The time for sowing winter wheat is fast approaching. In order to successfully complete next year's wheat production increase task, it is very necessary to make various preparations before planting wheat. A major part of these preparations is deep plowing and moisture conservation of wheat fields. The experience of many farmers proves that deep plowing and careful land preparation are important factors in increasing production. According to a survey by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, deep plowing one inch can increase production by 10%. In Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, most of the wheat fields were deeply plowed to more than five inches this year, and the average yield of wheat per mu in the county reached 260 jin. In the wheat-alfalfa rotation areas of this county, alfalfa roots are dug out every certain period, and the soil is turned over to a depth of about one foot. In 1952, in Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces in Northeast China, wheat fields that were deeply plowed with new agricultural implements also had significantly increased yields, with more than half of them increasing production by 35 to 70 jin per mu. The reason why deep plowing of wheat fields can increase production is that deep plowing can turn up the lower layer of soil and expose it to full sunlight, promoting soil weathering. At the same time, deep plowing can also turn over fallen leaves, weeds, and residual stalks on the ground and bury them in the soil to ferment into fertilizer. Wheat is a crop with deep roots, and deep plowing is conducive to the development of wheat roots. In particular, in most wheat-growing areas of our country, 30% to 60% of the annual rainfall is concentrated in July, August, and September. Therefore, seizing the time to carry out deep plowing before planting wheat, in addition to having the many benefits mentioned above, can also enable wheat fields to conserve moisture, so that good soil moisture is available at the time of sowing.

    Deep plowing should be done as early as possible. Early plowing can extend the soil weathering time and accumulate as much rainwater as possible. Wheat fields that are left fallow in the summer should seize the opportunity to carry out deep plowing during the hot season. A folk saying in southern Shanxi says: "Deep plowing in the hot season is better than watering the garden," which means that deeply plowed land can accumulate a lot of water. Land that has been deeply plowed during the hot season should be shallowly plowed once or twice after the Beginning of Autumn, followed by harrowing and rolling. Because there is less and less rainfall after autumn, harrowing and rolling must be combined with careful plowing to reduce the loss of moisture in the soil. This kind of harrowing and rolling also has a compaction effect, which makes the soil firm and facilitates seed germination and seedling growth. The land preparation methods of wheat production increase models in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, and southern Shanxi are mostly like this.

    In northern areas with two crops in three years and one crop in two years, the previous crop of wheat is generally a tall autumn crop. It is best to carry out a deeper cultivation in these fields in the summer. This can not only loosen the soil, remove weeds, and be conducive to the development and growth of tall autumn crops, but also facilitate the reception of rainwater during the hot season, and also be conducive to the sowing of wheat and the growth of seedlings. After the autumn crops are harvested in this kind of cultivated land, shallow plowing should be carried out along the ridges to reduce stubble, followed by deep plowing, and harrowing and rolling should be done immediately after plowing. If there is still a long time between the harvest of autumn crops and the planting of wheat, efforts can be made to shallowly plow once more. In irrigated land, if there is a drought before the previous crop is harvested, it can be irrigated once so that the land can be plowed immediately after harvest. Li Entong, a model worker in Wuzhi, Henan, irrigated his cornfields three days before harvesting, and immediately shallowly plowed to remove stubble after the corn was harvested, and then deeply plowed to seven or eight inches with a hitched plow, and harrowed the land immediately after plowing, using forward and diagonal harrowing to level and compact the land. In these areas, striving for early plowing is an important link in obtaining increased wheat production.

    In the rice-wheat double-cropping areas in the south, the field water should be drained during the yellow ripening period of rice so that the land can be plowed immediately after the rice is harvested. In early rice areas, because there is a long time between rice harvest and wheat planting, shallow plowing can be done first to remove stubble, and then deep plowing and fine harrowing; if time permits, shallow plowing and fine harrowing can be done again before sowing. In late rice areas, because the time between rice harvest and wheat planting is approaching, deep plowing and fine harrowing should be carried out immediately after rice harvest.

    作好麦田深耕早耕为明年小麦增产打好基础
    中央农业部粮食生产司
    播种冬小麦的时期很快就要来到了，为了胜利完成明年小麦增产任务，在种麦前作好各项准备工作是十分必要的。这些准备工作中主要的一项是麦田的深耕保墒。许多农民的经验证明，实行深耕、精细整地是增产的重要因素之一，根据山西省农林厅调查，深耕一寸可以增产一成。陕西武功县的麦地，今年大部深耕在五寸以上，全县小麦每亩平均产量达二百六十斤。这个县的小麦苜蓿轮栽地区，每隔一定期间挖苜蓿根一次，翻土约一尺深左右。东北黑龙江、松江两省一九五二年用新式农具深耕的麦地，大部分产量也都有显著增加，有一半以上每亩都能增产三十五斤至七十斤。麦田深耕所以能够增产，是因为深耕可把下层土壤翻上来受到日光充分的曝晒，促进土壤风化，同时深耕还可以把地面落叶、杂草、残茬等翻埋到土里沤成肥料。小麦是一种扎根很深的作物，深耕又利于小麦根株发育。特别是我国大部种麦地区，每年降雨量有百分之三十到百分之六十是集中在七、八、九三个月中，因此，在种麦前抓紧时间进行深耕，除了具有以上许多好处以外，还可以使麦田保蓄水分，在播种时有好的墒土可用。
    深耕应尽可能的提早。早耕可以延长土壤风化时间和尽多蓄积雨水。夏季休闲的麦地要抓紧伏天深耕工作，晋南农谚：“伏里深耕田，赛似水浇园”，就是指深耕的地可以积蓄大量水分。经过伏天深耕的地，在立秋后再浅耕一次或两次，紧接着就进行耙耱。因为秋后雨水渐少，耕后必须结合精细耙耱，以减少土壤中水分散失。这种耙耱还有一种镇压作用，使土壤落实，便于种子发芽和幼苗生长。陕西关中及晋南小麦增产模范的整地方法大都是这样。
    在北方两年三作和一年两作的地区小麦的前作，一般都种有大秋作物。这种田地最好在夏季进行一次较深的中耕，这样做不仅可以疏松土壤，清除杂草，有利于大秋作物的发育生长，也便于接纳伏天的雨水，同时也有利于小麦的播种和幼苗的生长。这种经过中耕的地，在秋庄稼收割后，随着就应顺垅浅耕减茬一次和深耕一次，耕后并立即耙耱。如秋庄稼收割后，离种麦还有较长的时间，可争取再浅耕一次。水浇地在前作收割前如遇天旱可浇一次水，以便收割后立即耕地。河南武陟劳动模范李恩同玉米地就是在收获前三天浇水一次，玉米收后立即浅耕灭茬，然后再用套犁深耕到七、八寸，耕后立即耙地，用顺耙斜耙将地整的松平塌实。在这些地区，争取早耕是获得小麦增产的重要环节。
    南方稻麦两熟地区的麦田，在水稻黄熟期间就应排干田水，以便稻子收割后即能耕地。在早稻地区，由于稻子收割后离种麦时间较长，可先浅耕灭茬，然后深耕细耙；如时间允许，在播种前还可以再浅耕细耙一次。在晚稻地区，因稻子收割后距种麦时间近迫，因此在稻子收割后应紧随着进行一次深耕细耙工作。
