Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch: TASS, Delhi, July 31st—Indian Prime Minister Nehru recently visited Karachi and held three days of talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Mohammed Ali.

The newspapers and public opinion of both countries warmly welcomed the meeting, considering it a step forward in resolving the disputes between India and Pakistan. According to Nehru, the talks were of a preliminary nature.

The two Prime Ministers discussed the Kashmir issue, the issue of refugee property, the issue of jointly using the Indus River water resources, the issue of resolving mutual territorial claims, and the issue of issuing passports and visas. All these issues arose after the partition of India and Pakistan and have been the source of disputes between India and Pakistan since 1947.

According to newspaper reports, the Kashmir issue was the main issue discussed, and the two Prime Ministers have agreed in principle to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir.

In a statement on the talks issued by Nehru at a press conference in Karachi, he said that the talks were conducted in a very friendly atmosphere, which showed a desire to do everything possible to eliminate the roots of hostility and suspicion between the peoples of the two countries. Nehru believes that the United Nations' attempts to resolve the Kashmir issue over the past five years have failed, and it would be better if India and Pakistan resolved the issue themselves without outside help. He also said that the talks did not bring the Kashmir issue closer to resolution, but considerable achievements were made in discussing other issues.

Mohammed Ali said after the meeting that both sides are determined to continue their efforts to reach a decision.

The talks will continue in Delhi at the end of August or the beginning of September.

Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch: TASS, Karachi, July 27th—The Karachi Peace Committee, the capital of Pakistan, at a special meeting held on July 26th, passed a resolution endorsing the talks held in Karachi between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan on resolving bilateral disputes. The resolution pointed out that trade relations should be promoted on the basis of mutual benefit, and measures should be taken to ensure the rights of all minorities.

Representatives of the Sindh Province Jauharabad Farmers Committee and the Karachi Workers United Front said at the meeting that in order to create a friendly atmosphere between India and Pakistan, all outstanding issues between the two countries must be resolved.

    尼赫鲁和穆罕默德·阿里会谈解决两国争端
    喀喇蚩和平委员会举行特别会议表示赞同
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社德里七月三十一日讯：印度总理尼赫鲁最近访问了喀喇蚩，和巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里举行了三天会谈。
    两国的报纸和舆论都热烈欢迎这次会谈，认为这是向解决印度和巴基斯坦之间的争执问题前进了一步。据尼赫鲁说，会谈是初步性质。
    两位总理讨论了克什米尔问题、关于难民的财产问题、共同使用印度河水源问题、解决相互的领土要求问题以及签发护照和签证问题。所有这些问题都是在印巴分治以后发生的，而且自一九四七年以来，就一直是印度和巴基斯坦的争端所在。
    据报纸消息，克什米尔问题是讨论的主要问题，两位总理在原则上已经一致同意在克什米尔举行公民投票。
    尼赫鲁在喀喇蚩举行记者招待会时发表的关于会谈的声明说，会谈是在非常友好的气氛中进行的，这种气氛表明了要尽一切可能来消除两国人民之间敌对和猜疑的根源的愿望。尼赫鲁认为过去五年中联合国解决克什米尔问题的企图已经失败，假如没有外界帮助而是由印度和巴基斯坦它们自己来解决这个问题，多少要好一些。他还说，这次会谈并没有使得克什米尔问题更接近于得到解决，但是在讨论其他问题的时候，获得了相当大的成就。
    穆罕默德·阿里在会谈后说，双方都决心继续努力以便作出决定。
    会谈将于八月底，或九月初在德里继续举行。
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社喀喇蚩七月二十七日电：巴基斯坦首都喀喇蚩和平委员会在七月二十六日举行的特别会议，通过决议，赞同印度和巴基斯坦两国总理在喀喇蚩举行的关于解决两国争端的会谈。决议指出应在互利的基础上促进贸易关系，并采取措施以保证各少数民族的权利。
    信德省甲考巴巴德农民委员会和喀喇蚩工人联合阵线的代表们都在会上说，为了在印巴两国之间创造友好气氛，必须解决两国间一切悬而未决的问题。
