National State-Owned Commercial Departments
    Vigorously Expand Sources of Goods to Welcome Peak Season
    [This newspaper dispatch] As the autumn trade peak season approaches, state-owned commercial departments across the country are vigorously expanding sources of goods to prepare for ample market supply.
    When formulating commodity circulation plans for the third and fourth quarters, the branches of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation in various regions implemented the policy of combining expanded processing, ordering, procurement, and sales to expand sources of goods. The Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation signed processing agreements with the weaving and dyeing industry, dyeing and finishing industry, etc., increasing the processing of dyed fabrics by 39 percent compared to the original plan. The value of colored cloth and wool flannel, etc., processed and ordered by the Wuhan Purchasing and Supply Station in the third quarter increased by 62.5 percent compared to the value of summer goods processed and ordered in the second quarter. The cotton cloth processing plan of the Xi'an Purchasing and Supply Station for the third quarter increased by 34 percent compared to the same period last year, and the quantity of dyed cloth increased by 86 percent. The Hunan Provincial Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation convened a work conference on expanding sources of goods, expanding the processing of local sources of goods, and increasing the supply plan for the third quarter by 43 percent. The clothing, shoes, and hats wholesale department of the Harbin area department store wholesale station has signed long-term processing agreements with one hundred larger local shoe industries, forty-three hat industries, the entire felt products industry, and the largest public and private clothing manufacturers.
    Many state-owned provincial department store companies have successively convened meetings of wholesale station managers to deploy the work of expanding sources of goods; central wholesale stations and second-level wholesale stations have successively expanded their purchase plans. For example, the Guangzhou Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station expanded the scope of ordering and exclusive sales, increasing the number of commodities by twenty-three categories compared to the first half of the year. The total value of purchases by the Jinan Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station in Shandong Province in the third quarter increased by 30 percent compared to the second quarter, and the variety also increased by more than 50 percent. The Wuhu Department Store Wholesale Station in Anhui Province supplemented the purchase plan for the third quarter in mid-June, expanding the total value of purchases by 20.6 billion yuan compared to the original plan, and adding more than 800 kinds of commodities such as hardware and small commodities.
    In order to avoid blindness in formulating plans, the state-owned commercial departments in some regions have conducted investigation and research work in a step-by-step and planned manner. For example, the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation sent people to the Northeast and other places to investigate the needs of the masses, and expanded the supply of commodity varieties based on the actual situation. The Qingdao Wholesale Store of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation investigated and analyzed the opinions of the masses through commodity variety exhibitions and symposiums, "out-of-stock logs" in retail stores, records of customer requirements for commodities, and resident surveys, and used this as a basis for revising plans. State-owned department store companies in other regions have convened professional meetings on sugar, paper, towels, socks, and other categories to understand the overall production and sales situation of these commodities in order to formulate overall business plans and improve supply and marketing work.
    In the work of expanding sources of goods, state-owned commercial departments in various regions have also paid attention to increasing the variety of colors and improving the quality of local industrial products to meet the needs of consumers. The Shanxi Provincial State-Owned Department Store Company convened representatives from local state-owned textile, woolen, paper-making, stationery, and leather factories in Taiyuan to hold a symposium to discuss issues such as improving product quality, variety, and color. Representatives of the department store company brought out samples of commodities that were popular with the masses for comparative study and put forward many opinions on the quality, variety, and color of the products of each factory. Representatives of local state-owned factories also introduced the experience of direct sales from their factories. After the meeting, local state-owned factories actively improved product quality, variety, and color according to the needs of the masses. The twenty-six wholesale stores under the Guangdong Provincial Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation sell more than ten different colors for each variety of cloth, many of which are processed and produced according to the opinions of farmers. The leather hats and cotton cloth shoes processed by the Harbin Department Store Wholesale Station have more than twenty styles. The Wuxi Purchasing Station of the Jiangsu Provincial Department Store Company also plans to purchase more than 1,000 new varieties of department stores. The Wuhan Purchasing and Supply Station has increased the processing varieties of small cloth factories from twelve in the second quarter to twenty-five. In order to innovate flower patterns and make the colors beautiful, the station has designated a special person to be responsible for flower pattern research and trial weaving.
    While expanding and developing sources of goods, purchasing and supply stations in various regions have also actively supported and guided handicraft production, helping handicrafts improve production technology and increase product quality and quantity. In order to enable the handicraft textile industry to absorb the advanced experience of the East China region in yarn and cloth processing, printing and dyeing, etc., the Xi'an Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Department Store Company organized representatives of the industry to visit various places in the East China region, which was very effective.
    At present, the peak season in some areas has arrived early, and state-owned commercial departments are taking emergency measures to improve supply work. In late July, after the bumper harvest of early rice, farmers in the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province enthusiastically sold new rice, and the demand for materials increased significantly. The sales volume of fertilizers, cloth, oil, salt, etc. in public and private shops and cooperatives in small towns such as Jinshi, Sanxianhu, and Caowei generally increased by one to ten times compared with late June. The Jinshi State-Owned Department Store sold only 870,000 catties of brown sugar in the past year, but the highest daily sales volume reached 90,000 catties in late July. However, some state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives underestimated this new situation in the market and did not prepare sufficient supplies, resulting in shortages of many major commodities. For example, the Anxiang State-Owned Cotton Yarn and Cloth Store originally planned to sell less than one day's worth of cloth in July. This shortage of materials has attracted great attention from the Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce. The department has instructed the provincial-level state-owned commercial departments to immediately send inspection teams to the state-owned stores in the lake area to check the supply work and to the rice-growing areas to check the supply preparation work, and help them to correctly formulate plans and improve operations. At the same time, a large number of materials were transported from major cities to support the early rice harvest areas in the lake.

    全国各地国营商业部门
    大力开辟货源迎接旺季
    【本报讯】秋后贸易旺季即将到来，全国各地国营商业部门正大力开辟货源，准备充分供应市场。
    中国花纱布公司各地分支公司在制定第三、四季度商品流转计划时，贯彻了扩大加工、订货、收购与销售相结合的方针，扩大了货源。中国花纱布公司天津市采购供应站，与织染业、染整业等签订了加工协议，加工的染色布较原计划增加百分之三十九。武汉市采购供应站第三季度加工的花色布和线呢等的价值，比第二季度加工订货的夏令商品的价值增加百分之六十二点五。西安市采购供应站第三季度的棉布加工计划，比去年同期提高了百分之三十四，染色布的数量增加了百分之八十六。中国花纱布公司湖南省公司召开了开辟货源工作会议，扩大地方货源的加工，将第三季度供应计划追加百分之四十三。哈尔滨地区百货批发站服装鞋帽批发部已与当地规模较大的一百家皮鞋业，四十三家制帽业，全部毡制品行业和最大的公营、私营服装厂商订了常年加工协议。
    许多国营省级百货公司都先后召开了批发站经理会议，布置了开辟货源的工作；中央批发站和二级批发站，都先后扩大了进货计划。例如广州市百货采购供应站扩大了订货包销范围，比上半年增加了二十三类商品。山东省济南市百货采购供应站第三季度进货总值，比第二季度增加了百分之三十，品种也增加百分之五十以上。安徽省芜湖百货批发站在六月中旬追补了第三季度进货计划，进货总值比原计划扩大了二百零六亿元，并增加了五金和小百货等商品八百多种。
    有些地区的国营商业部门为避免制订计划的盲目性，有步骤地有计划地进行了调查研究工作。如中国花纱布公司天津市采购供应站，曾派人到东北等地调查群众的需要，根据实际情况，扩大了商品品种的供应。中国花纱布公司青岛市批发商店通过商品品种的展览和座谈会、门市“缺货日志”、买主对商品要求的记录以及居民调查等方式，调查和分析了群众的意见，并以此作为依据修订计划。其他地区的国营百货公司都召开了食糖、纸张、毛巾、袜子等类的专业会议，了解这些商品的全面产销情况，以制定整个经营方案，改进供销工作。
    在扩大货源的工作中，各地国营商业部门还注意了增加花色品种和提高地方工业产品的质量，以适应消费者的需要。山西省国营百货公司召集了太原各地方国营纺织、毛织、造纸、文具和皮革等工厂的代表举行座谈会，讨论改进产品质量、品种和花色等问题。百货公司的代表在会上拿出为群众所欢迎的商品的样品作比较研究，对各厂产品的质量、品种和花色，提出了很多意见。地方国营工厂代表也介绍了本厂直接推销的经验。会后，各地方国营工厂根据群众的需要积极改进产品质量、品种和花色。中国花纱布公司广东省公司所属二十六个批发商店出售的布匹品种，每一品种有十多种不同颜色，其中不少布匹是根据农民意见进行加工生产的。哈尔滨百货批发站加工的皮帽子和棉布鞋，就有二十多种式样。江苏省百货公司无锡采购站也计划采购一千多种新的百货品种。武汉市采购供应站对小型布厂的加工品种已由第二季度的十二种增加为二十五种。该站为求花布花样翻新、色彩美观，已指定专人负责花样研究与试织工作。
    各地采购供应站在扩大开辟货源的同时，还积极扶植、指导手工业生产，帮助手工业改进生产技术，提高产品质量与数量。中国百货公司西安采购供应站为了使手工纺织业能够吸取华东各地纱布加工、印染等方面的先进经验，组织了该业代表到华东区各地参观，收效很大。
    目前，有些地区的市场旺季提早到来，国营商业部门正采取紧急措施，改进供应工作。七月下旬，湖南省洞庭湖滨湖地区农民在早稻丰收后，踊跃出售新稻，对物资需要量显著增大。津市、三仙湖、草尾等小市镇上公私营商店和合作社的肥料、布匹、油盐等销售量普遍比六月下旬增加一倍到十倍。津市国营百货商店去年一年中只销了红糖八十七万斤，而七月下旬每天最高销售量达九万斤。但是有些国营商业部门和合作社对市场这种新情况估计不足，供应物资准备不充分，使好些主要商品脱销。例如安乡国营花纱布商店原计划七月份一个月销售的布匹不到一天就卖完了。这种物资脱销的情况，已引起湖南省商业厅极大的重视。该厅已指示省级国营商业部门立即派检查组到滨湖地区各国营商店检查供应工作并到种稻地区检查供应准备工作，帮助他们正确制订计划，改进经营。同时，还从各主要城市运出大批物资支援滨湖早稻丰收地区。
