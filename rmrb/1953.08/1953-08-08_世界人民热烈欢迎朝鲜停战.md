The International Democratic Women's Federation Issues a Statement

The International Democratic Women's Federation issued a statement to the press. The statement said:

Women and mothers all over the world welcome the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the end of the Korean War with great joy.

This is a great victory for the heroic Korean people and the brave Chinese People's Volunteers. This is a great victory for the forces of peace all over the world...

The achievement of the Korean armistice shows that any differences can be resolved peacefully, that war is not inevitable, and that peace can be won if the people of all countries unite.

The World Women's Congress held in Copenhagen from June 5 to June 11, 1953, was a major contribution by women to the cause of peace. The conference called on women all over the world to fulfill their responsibilities to mankind, unite, and block the path of the forces of war.

The International Democratic Women's Federation calls on all national organizations belonging to the Federation, all women's groups, and all women around the world to jointly defend peace, ensure that the terms of the armistice agreement are faithfully observed, and to remain vigilant and continue to carry out various activities to turn the armistice into a lasting peace.

The International Democratic Women's Federation calls on all women to unite more closely, strive to end all current wars, resolve all international differences peacefully, and strive for the victory of peace throughout the world.

The Secretariat of the International Student Union hereby expresses our fraternal congratulations to you with sincere joy.

On the 3rd, the Secretariat of the International Student Union also sent a telegram to the Student Department of the Korean Democratic Youth League, congratulating them on the end of the Korean War. The telegram particularly pointed out: "The International Student Union is deeply convinced that Korean students and the Korean people will now begin to revive their war-torn motherland and build a new life in the shortest possible time. Korean students will undoubtedly receive the enthusiastic support of students all over the world in the project of rebuilding destroyed universities and libraries and in the work of restoring the education system."

The Australian Communist Party Issues a Statement

The Australian "Tribune" published a statement by the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Australian Communist Party on July 29 regarding the Korean armistice. The statement said: All good people in the world welcome the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement with great relief. This armistice is a victory for the forces of peace all over the world, proving that consultation can achieve results even in the most difficult circumstances.

After tracing the United States' use of various means to try to obstruct the armistice, the statement said: The broad public should further exert pressure to promote genuine peace in Korea.

The statement emphasized: As Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Malenkov said: No dispute or outstanding issue cannot be resolved peacefully on the basis of mutual agreement among the countries concerned. World public opinion should firmly demand that any international conflict must be resolved through consultation, not by force.

Secretary of the Indonesian Peace Committee Issues a Statement

Sumanha, Secretary of the Indonesian National Peace Committee, said on July 29: The people of every country welcome the Korean armistice with relief. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement proves that all international disputes can be resolved through consultation. At the same time, this will help promote lasting world peace. He went on to say: The armistice agreement may still be sabotaged by groups resisting peace, and Syngman Rhee has made it difficult to achieve the armistice. Therefore, the people of all countries must continue to work hard to achieve a solid peace in Korea and other parts of the world.
