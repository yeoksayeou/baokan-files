	Many Health Departments in Zhejiang Organize Medical Teams to Go Deep into Fields and Embankments to Treat Farmers
	Many local health departments in Zhejiang Province are actively cooperating with the rural drought resistance and autumn crop protection movement, organizing various medical teams to go deep into fields and embankments to treat farmers, which has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of farmers in resisting drought and protecting autumn crops.
	The health institutions in Jinhua City organized nine drought resistance and rescue teams, carrying various first-aid medicines, and treated more than 500 farmers and staff suffering from heatstroke, colds, trauma, malaria, and other diseases in 50 villages such as Donghu, Qinghu, and Xianqiao. The medical team organized by the Shangyu County People's Government Health Center braved the heat to go deep into remote mountainous areas to conduct mobile treatment. Shen Yongzhang, a physician at the Chengguan District Joint Clinic in Cixi County, even carried medicine to Banpu Township to treat farmers. Sometimes when the medicine ran out, he would walk more than 20 miles back to Chengguan District to get medicine overnight.
	In addition to doing a good job in drought resistance and autumn crop protection rescue work, the medical teams in various places also used the farmers' rest time to carry out summer health and disease prevention publicity and education for them.

There are forty-three counties in the province where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities or mixed residence, and now thirty-six counties have established Xinhua Bookstore branches or outlets.
