    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 31st - On the same day that the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed at Panmunjom, Sinanju, one of our five rear ports stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement, had already completed the construction of housing for use by the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams for office and residence.
    This cluster of neat new houses is striking in Sinanju, which has suffered severe war damage. It consists of nineteen buildings with seventy-two rooms. Each room has good flooring and ceilings, and the doors and windows are fitted with bright glass. Electric lights are installed inside and outside the rooms. These houses include offices, bedrooms, lounges, barbershops, etc. for the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. There are roads near these houses leading to Sinanju Railway Station.
    The construction process and rapid completion of this large area of housing demonstrates the Korean people's love of peace and their spirit of actively fulfilling the various clauses of the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    During the construction, the Korean laborers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm. They transported building materials from over a hundred miles away, dug bricks and tiles from the rubble, and leveled the foundations. They completed this construction project intensively within twelve days and nights.
    After the houses were completed, a 67-year-old woman, Kim Byung-ok, automatically joined the work of cleaning the houses. She said, "I am here to sweep the houses for the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, hoping that they will supervise the United States and Syngman Rhee well to prevent them from undermining the armistice, so that their stable life will not be destroyed again."

    我方后方口岸新安州修建房舍
    供中立国视察小组使用
    【新华社平壤三十一日电】在朝鲜停战协定在板门店签字的同一天，朝鲜停战协定中规定我方五个后方口岸之一的新安州，已经修建好了为中立国视察小组办公和居住用的房舍。
    这一片整齐的新房舍在遭受过战争的严重破坏的新安州出现，是很引人注目的。它共有十九栋、七十二间房间，每间房间都有很好的地板和天花板，门窗上装着明亮的玻璃，室内外都装置了电灯。这些房舍中有供中立国视察小组用的办公室、寝室、休息室、理发室等。这些房舍的附近有公路通到新安州火车站。
    这一大片房舍的修建过程和迅速完工，表明了朝鲜人民热爱和平与积极履行朝鲜停战协定中各项条款的精神。
    在修建中，朝鲜民工发挥了高度的劳动热情。他们从百里以外运来修建材料，从废墟中挖出砖瓦和填平房基，他们在十二个昼夜内紧张地完成了这项建筑工程。
    房舍落成后，一位六十七岁的金炳玉老太太自动参加打扫房子的工作。她说：“我来为中立国视察小组扫房子，希望他们好好监督美国和李承晚不破坏停战，使他们安稳的生活不至再被破坏。”
