Andong City is a beautiful and charming city. Standing on the summit of Zhenjiangshan Park, a scenic spot in the city, one can overlook the entire city for dozens of miles along the right bank of the Yalu River, which stretches along the national border: rows of neat and lush street trees, dense pedestrians on wide and flat roads, the sparkling river water, and the Yalu River Railway Bridge spanning the river... When people see the ruins and rubble of the famous North Korean city of Sinuiju across the river, which was bombed by American planes, they will recall the serious threat faced by the people of Andong City during the more than three years of the American invasion of Korea.

Andong City was frequently harassed and bombed by American planes, but the people of the city, under the slogan of "Defending the Frontier of the Motherland," launched a tenacious struggle to maintain production and stand fast at their posts. One cold winter night in 1950, American planes dropped many bombs near Andong Railway Station. The employees of the Andong Railway Sub-bureau rushed to the bombed site through the thick smoke to carry out heroic rescue work. Those who arrived first were stunned by the exploding bombs, and those who arrived later rushed up again. When they rescued near the railway line, they discovered a time bomb that had not yet exploded in the middle of the line, and at the same time a train full of supplies was speeding towards them. At this critical moment, Communist Party member Li Shuyou stepped forward bravely and carried the unexploded bomb away and threw it into the open space. Another dark night, the repair team created the miracle of erecting seven hundred and seven sleepers by groping by hand in four and a half hours. The employees of the Andong Power Bureau often insisted on emergency repairs under the bombing and strafing of American planes. Su Facheng, an outside line worker, climbed a steel tower more than 40 meters above the ground to connect the line under the low-altitude strafing of American aircraft; during the most frantic period of American aircraft, he had continuously carried out emergency repairs for four days and nights. The heroic actions of the employees of the Andong Railway Sub-bureau and the Andong Power Bureau protected the smooth flow of transportation lines.

Such heroic deeds can be found in every department of Andong City, and many have also emerged among the people. Wang Jingbin, an eighteen-year-old heroine and head of the telephone operator team of the Andong Railway Sub-bureau who insisted on working under the bombing and strafing of American aircraft, Wang Xinli, the head of the telephone operator team of the Andong Telegraph Office, Wu Guangyao, a citizen who rescued injured compatriots in the face of flying shrapnel, and Yu Aiqiu, a nurse at the Liaodong Provincial Hospital who took care of injured compatriots for two consecutive days and nights, their heroic deeds are often spread throughout the city.

The bloody crimes of the American aggressors angered the people of Andong City, their patriotic ideology was greatly enhanced, and they deeply understood the significance of supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers to achieve greater victories. All the Chinese People's Volunteers who passed through Andong City on their way back home were placed in warm houses, and people took care of them as if they were their own relatives. Model supporter Jiao Da Niang is one of the thousands of mothers who love the volunteers. When a group of wounded volunteer soldiers returning from the Shangganling battlefield in Korea arrived in Andong City, Jiao Da Niang hurried to the hospital to take care of them after hearing about it. She stroked the wounded soldiers' hands and advised them to recuperate well. She ran around in the ward all day taking care of the wounded soldiers, mending quilts and socks for these heroes. Jiao Da Niang's enthusiastic care for the volunteer comrades deeply moved the "most beloved people". When they left Andong, they automatically pooled money to make a silk banner for Jiao Da Niang. This is one of the many silk banners received by Jiao Da Niang.

Model martyr's family member Song Chuanyi is a seventy-three-year-old "patriotic old man." During the donation campaign in 1951, he sacrificed his summer lunch break to carefully tend vegetable gardens and go to the mountains to pick wild vegetables and raise pigs, increasing production and donations. He completed the original plan to donate 300,000 yuan in Renminbi in advance, and also donated an additional 400,000 yuan. After three years of the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, more than 300 model revolutionary martyrs, family members of soldiers, model supporters of the army and preferential treatment to families of soldiers, as well as model figures in emergency repair and transport, have emerged in Andong City.

In the past three years, under the leadership of these model figures, the people of Andong City have enthusiastically supported the Chinese People's Volunteers. The city has successively transported tens of thousands of civilian workers and thousands of young people to the Korean front to join the Chinese People's Volunteers. In the donation campaign for aircraft and artillery launched in 1951, the people of Andong City donated more than 9 billion yuan on the basis of increasing production and practicing economy, which could purchase six fighter jets. In the past two years, the city has launched four mass movements to support the army, and has donated more than 600 million yuan in comfort funds to the volunteers alone. In order to enable the wounded and sick volunteers returning home to recover their health as soon as possible, young workers and students have automatically organized many blood transfusion teams, and they all regard giving blood to the volunteers as supreme glory.

For three years, the people of Andong City, who have always stood at the forefront of supporting the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, have won the warm praise of the volunteer comrades returning home. In order to thank the people of Andong City for their kind concern and strong support, these heroic soldiers have given hundreds of silk banners to people's organizations and model figures in Andong City, and many banners are inscribed with the words "Salute to the People of the Heroic National Defense City".

    鸭绿江边的英雄城市——安东
    新华社记者  汪钦、李俊
    安东市是个清秀美丽的城市。站在市的风景胜地——镇江山公园的山巅，可以俯瞰绵延国境的鸭绿江右岸数十华里的全城面貌：一排排整齐葱绿的街道树木，宽阔平坦的马路上的稠密行人，碧波荡漾的江水和横跨在江面上的鸭绿江大铁桥……。当人们看到江对岸朝鲜名城新义州被美国飞机炸得到处是断墙残壁时，就会联想到在三年多的美国侵朝战争中安东市人民所面临的严重威胁。
    安东市经常遭受美国飞机的骚扰和轰炸，但是全市人民在“保卫祖国边疆”的口号下，展开了坚持生产、坚守工作岗位的顽强的斗争。一九五零年冬的一个严寒的夜里，美国飞机在安东车站附近投下了许多炸弹，安东铁路分局的员工们就冒着浓密的硝烟奔赴被炸的地点，英勇地进行抢救。先到的人被爆炸的炸弹震昏了，后到的人又冲了上去。当他们抢救到线路附近时，发现线路中间有一枚尚未爆炸的定时炸弹，同时对面正急驶来一列满载物资的火车。在这危急的关头，共产党员李树有挺身而出，勇敢地把还没有爆炸的炸弹抱走，丢到空地上去了。另一个黑夜，抢修队员们创造了在四小时半的时间内用手摸索着架起七百零七根枕木的奇迹。安东电业局职工们，往往在美国飞机轰炸扫射下坚持抢修工作。外线工人苏发成曾在美机低空扫射下，登上距地面四十多公尺高的铁塔上接线；在美国飞机最疯狂的时期，他曾连续抢修四昼夜。安东铁路分局和安东电业局职工们的英雄行为，保卫着交通线路的畅达。
    像这样的英雄事迹，在安东市各个部门中都可找到，在人民群众中也出现了不少。在美机轰炸扫射下坚持工作的安东铁路分局话务班班长十八岁的女英雄王静彬，安东报话局话务班班长王心力，冒着纷飞的弹片抢救受害同胞的市民吴广耀，连续两昼夜不休息地护理受伤同胞的辽东省立医院护士于爱秋等，他们的英勇事迹，经常地在全市传颂着。
    美国侵略者的血腥罪行激怒了安东市的人民，他们的爱国主义思想大大提高了，他们深刻地理解支援中国人民志愿军取得更大胜利的意义。凡是返国途中路过安东市的中国人民志愿军战士们，都被安置到温暖的房屋里，人们像对待亲人一样地照顾他们。著名的拥军模范缴大娘，就是千万个热爱志愿军的母亲之一。当从朝鲜上甘岭战地回来的一批负伤的志愿军战士来到安东市时，缴大娘听说后就赶忙到医院里去照顾他们，她抚摸着伤员的手，劝他们好好休养。她成天地在病房里跑来跑去照顾伤员，为这些英雄们拆被子、补袜子。缴大娘对志愿军同志的热情关怀，深深地感动了“最可爱的人”，他们离开安东时，自动凑钱给缴大娘作了一面锦旗。这是缴大娘收到许多面锦旗中的一面。
    模范烈士家属宋传义是一位七十三岁的“爱国老人”，在一九五一年开展捐献运动时，他牺牲了一个夏季的午休时间，精心侍弄菜地和上山采野菜养猪，增产捐献，提前缴齐了原订的捐献人民币三十万元的计划，另外又增捐了四十余万元。经过三年来的抗美援朝斗争，安东市涌现出这样的模范革命烈士、军人家属，拥军优属模范以及抢修和抢运模范人物共有三百多人。
    三年来，安东市人民就在这些模范人物带动下，热烈地支援着中国人民志愿军。全市先后向朝鲜前线输送了数万民工和上千的青年参加了中国人民志愿军。一九五一年开展的捐献飞机大炮运动中，安东市人民在增产节约的基础上，捐献了九十亿余元，可购买战斗机六架。两年多来，全市开展了四次群众性的拥军运动，仅捐献给志愿军的慰问款就有六亿多元。为使归国志愿军伤病员早日恢复健康，青年工人和学生们自动组织了许多输血队，他们都把给志愿军输血引为无尚光荣。
    三年来，始终站在支援抗美援朝斗争最前线的安东市人民，博得了返国的志愿军同志们的热烈赞扬。这些英雄的战士们为答谢安东市人民的亲切关怀和有力支援，曾送给安东市人民团体和模范人物数百面锦旗，很多旗帜上面都写了“向英雄的国防城市的人民致敬”的字样。
