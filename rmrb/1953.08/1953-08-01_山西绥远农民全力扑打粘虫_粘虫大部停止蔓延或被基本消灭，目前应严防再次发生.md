Communicator Guo Shi reflects: In areas of Shanxi Province where armyworms occurred, after government cadres led the masses in capture and eradication, the majority have stopped spreading or have been basically eliminated. Currently, leadership organs at all levels in the affected areas of the province are actively leading the masses to strengthen field inspections and carry out work such as digging up pupae, collecting eggs, and capturing moths, strictly preventing the recurrence of armyworms.

From late June to mid-July, armyworms occurred in some areas of Shanxi. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government and the governments of the affected areas successively adopted effective pest control measures. In addition to urgently notifying various localities to actively capture and eliminate pests through radio and newspapers, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government also sent 34 cadres to various localities to specifically help and guide the eradication work. Affected areas also organized large numbers of cadres to go to the countryside to lead pest control. According to reports from seventeen counties including Tianzhen, Hunyuan, Qingxu, Yuci, Daixian, and Wutai, as well as the suburbs of Taiyuan City and the Yanbei Special District, more than 2,000 people were投入 (threw themselves) into this work. In areas severely affected by pests, the work of dividing townships was suspended to concentrate efforts on actively controlling the pests.

With the emphasis placed by leadership organs at all levels, pest control work quickly got underway. For example, Daixian County mobilized 13,211 people throughout the county, capturing more than 26,800 jin of insects in ten days, saving more than 1,000 mu of autumn fields from being harmed by pests. In the suburbs of Taiyuan, from July 1st to 9th, an average of more than 4,400 people participated in pest control work every day, capturing a total of 18,577 jin of insects (not including those trampled to death). In the work of eradicating armyworms, women and children played a considerable role. Due to their active participation in pest control, many areas resolved the contradiction of insufficient labor for pest control, summer harvesting, and weeding.

In the pest control work, many areas used concrete facts to educate the masses, overcoming the superstitious idea that people "dare not fight" and that "the more they fight, the more there will be." For example, in Chiqiao Village in Taiyuan's Sixth District, armyworms were severely damaging crops. Some of the masses slaughtered three sheep to sacrifice to the insects, but the leaves of the crops were still eaten by the insects. At the same time, 138 students from the village's elementary school and quick literacy class used manual capture methods to control the pests, eliminating the insects and protecting the crops. After this kind of vivid factual education, the masses in this village truly recognized the benefits of pest control and actively participated in the work.

In this armyworm eradication work, many areas created new pest control methods. The masses in Yuci County, while promoting the method of digging ditches to block and kill, created a method of digging ditches within ditches, making it easier to capture and kill insects concentrated in the small ditches. The masses in Lishi County, in the work of capturing insects, used local water conservancy conditions and the characteristic that armyworms fall to the ground when shaken, creating a method of drowning by irrigation. Many areas also adopted a combination of ditch digging and chemical spraying, sprinkling some "666" powder in the ditches to poison the armyworms that fell into them. Farmers in Xinxian and Jiaocheng and other places also tried using poisoned bait to kill the insects. Twelve liang of 6% wettable "666," mixed with about ten jin of wheat bran and rice bran, with a little water, was made into poisoned bait. In the morning, three rows of poisoned bait were scattered in the direction of the armyworms' concentrated invasion, each row about one chi wide, with very good insecticidal effects.

Communicator Yang Mu reports: According to incomplete statistics, the area affected by armyworms in Suiyuan Province is over one million mu. The Party and government leaders of Suiyuan Province adopted a series of emergency measures to quickly eradicate the pests. On July 10th, Yang Zhilin, Vice Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, personally went to Wuliying Village in the First District of Guisui County to guide and inspect pest control work. On July 11th and 12th, Kui Bi, Vice Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, also personally went to the Fourth District of Tumote Banner and the towns of Guisui Bikeqi and Chasuqi to inspect pest control work. At the same time, Ha Feng'a, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, on behalf of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government and Chairman Ulanhu, went to Wuligulu Administrative Village and Baishihu Administrative Village in the Sixth District of Guisui County to express condolences, and led pest control technicians, carrying medicine and equipment, to assist farmers in capturing and eradicating pests.

Under the care and personal guidance of the leaders, the vast numbers of Mongolian and Han cadres and masses in the aforementioned affected areas were in high spirits for pest control. For example, in Wuliying Village in Guisui, on July 11th and 12th, a total of more than 650 people were mobilized, capturing more than 5,200 jin of armyworms. Chasuqi Town and the Fourth Administrative Village of Tumote Banner also organized a joint Mongolian and Han working group, assigning areas to each group to mobilize Mongolian, Han, and Hui farmers to actively capture and eradicate pests. The armyworms in various villages of Xigui Township in the severely affected Chasuqi area were quickly wiped out.

In order to further mobilize the masses to quickly eradicate armyworms, the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government issued an emergency order on July 13th to step up the prevention and control of armyworms (i.e., armyworms), requiring people's governments at all levels in affected areas to actively organize forces to carry out a concentrated pest eradication campaign, treating pest eradication as the overriding central task in these areas. Subsequently, on July 17th, a provincial-level general headquarters for pest prevention and control was established, and more than 800 cadres from various provincial departments were selected and divided into seven large teams, which were sent to Guisui County, Tumote Banner, and the seven affected counties in eastern Suiyuan to assist in the work. At the same time, the CCP Central Committee Mengsui Branch, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, and the Guisui Municipal People's Government also selected some cadres to go to the suburbs of Guisui City to assist the masses in pest eradication.

    山西绥远农民全力扑打粘虫
    粘虫大部停止蔓延或被基本消灭，目前应严防再次发生
    通讯员郭石反映：山西省发生粘虫的地区经过人民政府干部领导群众捕打，大部已停止蔓延或基本消灭。目前该省发生粘虫地区的各级领导机关，正积极领导群众加强田间检查，和进行挖蛹、采卵、捕蛾等工作，严防粘虫再次发生。
    六月下旬至七月中旬山西部分地区发生粘虫，山西省人民政府和发生虫害地区的政府曾先后采取了有效的治虫措施。山西省人民政府除通过电台、报纸紧急通知各地积极捕灭外，并派干部三十四人分赴各地具体帮助和指导除治工作。各发生虫害的地区也先后组织大批干部下乡领导除虫。据天镇、浑源、清徐、榆次、代县、五台等十七县及太原市郊区、雁北专区就有二千多人投入这一工作，在虫害严重地区并停止了划乡工作，以便集中力量积极治虫。
    在各级领导机关重视的情况下，除虫工作很快得到开展。如代县全县发动群众一万三千二百一十一人，在十天内捉虫二万六千八百多斤，挽救了一千多亩秋田没有遭到虫害。太原郊区在七月一日至九日每天平均有四千四百多人参加除虫工作，共捉虫一万八千五百七十七斤（踩死的没有计算在内）。在除治粘虫工作中，妇女、儿童起了相当大的作用，由于她们积极参加治虫，不少地区解决了除虫和夏收、锄苗等劳力调配不开的矛盾。
    在除虫工作中，不少地区用具体事实教育了群众，克服了群众认为“不敢打”、“越打越多”的迷信思想。如太原六区赤桥村粘虫为害严重，有一部分群众杀了三只羊祭虫，结果庄稼叶子仍被虫子吃光，同时这村小学和速成识字班的学生一百三十八人，用人工捕打方法治虫，结果消灭了虫子，保住了庄稼。经过这种活的事实教育，这村群众已真正认识了治虫的好处，纷纷参加了治虫工作。
    在这次除治粘虫工作中，不少地区创造了新的治虫方法。榆次县群众在推广挖沟阻杀的办法中，创造出沟内挖沟的方法，使虫集中在小沟内容易捕杀。离石县群众在捕虫工作中，利用当地水利条件和粘虫一震动就落地的特点，创造出灌水淹杀的办法。还有不少地区采用了挖沟与药杀相结合的方法，在沟内撒一些“六六六”粉剂，使跌落在沟里的粘虫被毒死掉。忻县、交城等地农民还试用了用毒饵毒杀的办法。用百分之六可湿性“六六六”十二两，麸皮、谷糠共约十斤，稍加水拌匀，制成毒饵。早晨在迎着粘虫集中侵袭的方向散三道毒饵，每道宽约一尺，灭虫效果很好。
    通讯员杨木反映：据不完全统计，绥远省粘虫为害面积约在一百万亩以上。绥远省党、政领导方面为了迅速扑灭虫害，采取了一系列的紧急措施。七月十日，绥远省人民政府杨植霖副主席亲自到归绥县一区五里营村指导和检查除虫工作。七月十一、十二两日绥远省人民政府奎璧副主席也亲到土默特旗四区和归绥毕克齐、察素齐两镇检查除虫工作。与此同时，内蒙古自治区人民政府哈丰阿副主席，代表内蒙古自治区人民政府和乌兰夫主席，到归绥县五里古路行政村和六区百什户行政村进行慰问，同时率领防虫技术人员，携带药械，协助农民捕打害虫。
    在首长的关怀和亲自指导下，上述发生虫害地区的广大蒙、汉干部和群众，除虫情绪很高。如归绥五里营村在七月十一、十二两日，共发动群众六百五十多人，捕打粘虫五千二百多斤；察素齐镇和土默特旗第四行政村，还组织了蒙汉联合工作组，分片包干，动员蒙、汉、回各族农民积极捕打。虫害严重的察素齐地区西柜乡各村的粘虫已很快被消灭光。
    为了进一步发动群众迅速扑灭粘虫，绥远省人民政府在七月十三日发布了加紧防治虸蚄虫（即粘虫）的紧急命令，要求各发生虫害地区的各级人民政府，积极组织力量突击灭虫，把灭虫当作这些地区压倒一切的中心工作。随后又在七月十七日成立了全省的防治害虫总指挥部，并抽调省级各部门干部八百余人，分为七个大队，分赴归绥县、土默特旗和绥东七县各受害地区协助工作。同时中共中央蒙绥分局、内蒙古自治区人民政府和归绥市人民政府也抽调出部分干部，前往归绥市郊区协助群众除虫。
