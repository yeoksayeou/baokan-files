    Why Children Under Three Chi (尺) Cannot Enter Entertainment Venues
    Recently, this newspaper has received many letters from readers asking why children under three chi (尺) are not allowed to enter cinemas and theaters to watch movies and plays. Now, this newspaper publishes the reply from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Administration to our reader, Comrade Lu Yongchang, as an answer to this question:
    The reason why cinemas and theaters do not allow children under three chi (尺) to enter is not only because children's noise disturbs the order in the venue; the main reason is to protect children's health. Generally speaking, most children under three chi (尺) are under four years old. They are in the development stage and have weak resistance to diseases. If they watch movies or dramas with adults in cinemas and theaters with poor air quality, it will be detrimental to their health. In order to allow children to see movies and protect their health, we are now trying to gradually solve this problem. In terms of drama, there are already some plays specifically for children, such as "Little White Rabbit"; in terms of movies, we will also prepare to show children's screenings. However, these have not been done before, and there will inevitably be many shortcomings now. We hope that all parties can provide opinions at any time.

### 为什么三市尺以下儿童不能进入娱乐场所

    为什么三市尺以下儿童不能进入娱乐场所
    近来本报收到不少读者来信，询问为什么三市尺以下儿童不能进影剧院看电影、看戏。现在本报特将北京市人民政府文化事业管理处对本报读者路永常同志的复信发表于后，作为对这一问题的答复：
    影剧院不准三市尺以下儿童入场，除了因为儿童吵嚷妨害场内秩序外；主要原因，还是为了保护儿童健康。一般讲来，三市尺以下的儿童在四岁以下者居多，他们正在发育时期，抵抗疾病的能力弱，如在空气不新鲜的影剧场内同成年人在一起看电影或戏剧，对儿童健康是有妨碍的。为了使儿童看到影剧并保护儿童健康，我们现在正设法逐步解决这个问题。在戏剧方面，现在已经有些专门给儿童演的戏如“小白兔”等；电影方面亦将准备开演儿童场，不过这些以前都没有办过，现在举办，缺点必然很多，希望各方面能随时提供意见。
