    Construction Engineering Departments in Provinces and Cities of North China
    Inspect the Quality of Basic Construction Projects
   [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] Construction engineering departments in provinces and cities of the North China region, on the basis of establishing the responsibility system movement, have begun to inspect the quality of engineering projects.
    The North China Administrative Council's Bureau of Construction Engineering issued instructions to the construction engineering bureaus and directly subordinate companies of each province and city in mid-July, requesting that all localities, based on their specific circumstances, mobilize the masses to conduct a major quality inspection in order to instill the idea of "Quality First for a Century-Long Plan" among employees, improve technical management, and improve project quality. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also issued a circular on August 1 regarding the issue of engineering quality in basic construction projects, calling on all basic construction departments to vigorously eliminate the current phenomenon of poor engineering quality through major quality inspections, and to lay a good foundation for further improving engineering quality in future large-scale construction and labor competitions. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government's Bureau of Construction Engineering convened a conference on engineering quality inspection on August 5, analyzed the quality accidents that had occurred in the province's engineering sector, and decided to strengthen on-site technical management. The measures are: first, construction must be carried out according to the design; second, reduce the administrative duties of technical personnel, distinguish the technical levels of workers, in order to overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible for technical management and the confusion of technical levels affecting project quality; third, promulgate a draft of the province's reinforced concrete engineering construction specifications and precautions for construction during the rainy season, in order to implement technical operating procedures.
    Design departments in various places have also begun to inspect the quality of engineering designs. In July, the Beijing Design Institute checked and improved the quality of design work through methods such as summarizing the work of the second quarter, soliciting opinions from construction sites, and holding design quality exhibitions. The Design Department of the North China Construction Engineering Bureau and the design departments of various provinces and cities have dispatched seven inspection teams to conduct inspections of key projects, in order to summarize experience, improve designs, and jointly ensure project quality.

    华北区各省市建筑工程部门
    检查基本建设工程的质量
   【新华社二十日讯】华北区各省、市建筑工程部门在建立责任制运动的基础上，开始检查工程质量。
    华北行政委员会建筑工程局曾在七月中旬向各省、市建筑工程局和直属公司发出指示，要求各地根据具体情况，发动群众，进行一次质量大检查，以便在职工中树立“百年大计，质量第一”的思想，改进技术管理，提高工程质量。中共河北省委员会在八月一日也发出关于基本建设施工中工程质量问题的通报，号召各基本建设部门通过质量大检查，大力消除目前某些工程质量低劣的现象，并为今后大量施工和劳动竞赛中进一步提高工程质量打下良好的基础。山西省人民政府建筑工程局在八月五日召开了工程质量检查会议，对该省工程方面所发生的质量事故作了分析，决定加强现场的技术管理，办法是：第一、必须根据设计进行施工；第二、减少技术人员的行政业务，分清工人的技术等级，以克服技术管理方面无人负责、技术等级混乱影响工程质量的现象；第三、颁发全省钢筋混凝土工程施工规范草案，雨季施工注意事项，以贯彻技术操作规程。
    各地的设计部门也开始检查工程设计质量。北京市设计院在七月间通过第二季度工作总结，征求工地意见和设计质量展览会等方法，检查和改进了设计工作的质量。华北建筑工程局设计处和各省、市设计部门已派出七个检查组，进行重点工程的检查，以总结经验，改进设计，共同保证工程质量。
