The State Council of the Central People's Government's instruction on agricultural tax work in 1953 has made a basic summary of the agricultural tax work in the past three years; it has made extremely important provisions for the principles, policies, and implementation methods of agricultural tax. Correctly implementing this instruction is not only a major political task for tax work departments, but also for party and government leading organs at all levels and rural work cadres.

The importance of agricultural taxation during the national construction period is no less than its importance during the revolutionary war period or the recovery period. On the contrary, precisely because our country has entered a period of planned economic construction, with the progress of industrial construction, agriculture must have corresponding development, the alliance between workers and peasants must be further consolidated, and the correct implementation of agricultural tax policy will obviously play a significant role in developing agricultural production and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, if the agricultural tax policy is not correctly grasped, it will inevitably hinder agricultural production, hinder the worker-peasant alliance, and inevitably lead to serious political errors.

The State Council's instruction repeatedly emphasized the importance of agricultural tax to the country, which should be deeply understood by all our cadres and the people. The instruction says: "During the past revolutionary war period, it was the main source of our income. In the past three years, we have successfully ensured the balance of national revenue and expenditure, the needs of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and the stability of market prices because we completed the collection of public grain. In the future, with the development of industry, although the proportion of agricultural tax in the total national income will gradually decrease relatively, it will always be a huge source of national income and a major guarantee for stabilizing market prices and supplying military and civilian food needs." Therefore, any viewpoint that underestimates agricultural tax work is very wrong.

In the past three years, agricultural tax has played a huge role in balancing the national budget, regulating the market, stabilizing grain prices, guaranteeing military and civilian food needs, and providing disaster relief. In terms of policy implementation, according to the principles of reasonable burden and encouraging increased production, and in accordance with the development of the rural economy, the policy of "determining the normal annual output, calculating and levying taxes according to the rate, and reducing or exempting taxes according to law, without increasing taxes for increased production" has been gradually implemented. This has made the burden on farmers gradually become more reasonable, gradually stabilized and improved farmers' enthusiasm for production. Therefore, generally reviewing the agricultural tax policy and agricultural tax work in the past three years, we should think that it has been basically successful. However, this does not mean that we have no shortcomings and errors in the implementation of agricultural tax policy. On the contrary, because some leading organs have neglected the principle of collecting agricultural tax according to the needs of the country and the specific circumstances of agricultural production development in many issues, and have not clearly explained the policy boundaries and working methods to the vast number of cadres, and have not taken various measures to facilitate farmers as much as possible, this has fueled the development of coercive and commanding work styles of some cadres. Many cadres lack investigation and research in their work, lack propaganda and education for farmers, do not understand the specific situation of farmers' production development and farmers' ability to bear the burden, are not good at relying on the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers to complete the collection of agricultural tax, and mechanically and one-sidedly pursue the figures of agricultural tax revenue, resulting in serious phenomena such as the burden on farmers being too high or too low, the policy of reducing or exempting taxes according to law not being correctly implemented, and continuous casualties of people and animals during the transportation of grain into storage. We must conscientiously implement the State Council's instruction on agricultural tax work in 1953, resolutely overcome the above-mentioned errors and shortcomings, and further improve the work of collecting agricultural tax.

Chairman Mao has always instructed us that we must guarantee supply on the basis of developing the economy. Now, the State Council's instruction on agricultural tax work in 1953 clearly stipulates: "In the next three years, the target for agricultural tax collection should be stabilized at the level of the actual collection in 1952, and no longer increased." This is an extremely important principle. We know that agricultural production in 1952 exceeded that in 1951, but agricultural tax in 1952 was lower than that in 1951, which relatively reduced the burden on farmers. Stabilizing the agricultural tax collection target at the level of 1952 in the next three years, on the basis of the gradual development of agricultural production, will inevitably further relatively reduce the burden on farmers. This is very necessary. Because although the lives of the vast number of farmers have improved compared with the past, due to the fact that most areas were liberated and completed land reform relatively late, the changes in farmers' lives will not be too fast, so it is still far from the goal of providing all farmers with adequate food and clothing. The lives of many farmers are still quite poor, and most farmers do not have enough savings to resist severe natural disasters. Therefore, we must take all methods to create an environment and conditions for farmers to recuperate and develop, in order to unleash farmers' enthusiasm for production, increase the output of various crops, and further develop the rural economy. Fixing the amount of agricultural tax for a certain period of time, so that farmers can grasp their own field output, the tax rate to be paid, and the amount of tax, thereby releasing them to develop production and better arrange their own lives, is obviously one of the extremely important conditions for enabling farmers to recuperate and develop. As long as we implement the agricultural tax policy well, issue agricultural loans, help farmers overcome difficulties, and take other measures to reward and develop rural production, then China's agricultural economy will definitely grow year by year.

However, we must never pit this basic policy of agricultural taxation against the task of agricultural tax collection. Due to the lack of necessary education and assistance from some leading organs to the vast number of tax work cadres, many cadres often pitted policy against tasks in their actual work, one-sidedly pursuing "tasks" and "figures" while abandoning and violating policies. This is one of the most important reasons for the various deviations that occurred in the process of implementing the agricultural tax policy in the past. These cadres did not have a correct understanding of the policy, and naturally lacked a correct attitude towards completing the task. It should be recognized that the policies and tasks stipulated by the Party and the government are completely consistent. The agricultural tax policy and tasks are formulated in accordance with the general guideline of "developing the economy and guaranteeing supply." The overall agricultural tax collection target is based on the overall guidelines and policies and the actual situation in various parts of the country. There should be a realistic estimate of how much can be collected according to the rate and how much can be reduced or exempted according to law. It is impossible to imagine that the government would stipulate and require cadres to perform a task that cannot be completed according to the policy. However, in actual work, why do some cadres indeed have the illusion that "policy and task are opposed"? This is mainly because they lack in-depth understanding of the actual situation. They often regard the lives of farmers in economic crop areas or the lives of a few wealthy farmers as the lives of ordinary farmers on the one hand, or lightly believe the reports of exaggerating the disaster situation and reducing output in some areas; on the other hand, they mechanically complete the figures of the tax collection task. In this way, it is natural that they cannot correctly implement the policy, and it is natural that they will pit being responsible to the superior against being responsible to the masses. The State Council's instruction on agricultural tax work in 1953 pointed out: "It is wrong to achieve or exceed the target figures, or fail to reach the target figures, without handling affairs according to policy in a practical and realistic manner. The policy must be observed, and the task must be guaranteed to be completed. The two are unified. The view that pits the task against the policy is wrong and must be changed."

How can we avoid repeating this mistake in the past? The key lies in having a correct understanding of the policy and tasks on the one hand, and conducting in-depth and comprehensive investigation and research on the actual situation at that time and place on the other hand, so that the policy can be reflected through the actual situation.

In order to do a good job in agricultural tax work, it is necessary to rely conscientiously on the broad masses, just like all other work. The saying that "tax work is a work of reaching out to the masses for things, and there is no way to follow the mass line" is completely wrong. We must conduct propaganda and explanation work on the agricultural tax policy to the vast number of farmers, so that the masses truly understand the close relationship between our country's tax policy and the immediate and long-term interests of the masses, and that the masses truly understand the rationality of the agricultural tax policy and collection methods. As long as this is achieved, as long as the broad masses are mobilized to participate in the collection of agricultural tax, then the work of evaluating output, reducing or exempting taxes according to law, and transporting grain into storage will all be easy to do. Any coercive and commanding ideology and work style is an expression of an extreme lack of mass viewpoint, and is a result of a lack of sufficient estimation of the great revolutionary work we have carried out in the countryside for many years and the improvement of the political awareness of the liberated farmers in our country. The victory of agricultural tax collection work in the vast areas in the past has proved that the broad masses of farmers are actively supporting the agricultural tax policy stipulated by our Party and the People's Government, and have vigorous patriotic enthusiasm. As long as the rural work cadres and financial and grain workers conscientiously adopt the attitude and work style of relying on the masses and seeking truth from facts, carry forward the experience that has been accumulated in agricultural tax work in the past, and act conscientiously in accordance with the policy, then the agricultural tax collection work this year will definitely be successfully completed.

### 正确贯彻农业税收政策

    正确贯彻农业税收政策
    中央人民政府政务院发布的关于一九五三年农业税工作的指示，对于过去三年来农业税工作，做了基本的总结；对于农业税的方针、政策和实施办法，做了极其重要的规定。正确地贯彻执行这个指示，不但是税收工作部门，而且是各级党、政领导机关和农村工作干部的重大的政治任务。
    农业税收对于国家建设时期的重要性，决不比对于革命战争时期或恢复时期的重要性为小。相反的，正因为我们的国家已经进入了有计划的经济建设时期，随着工业建设的进展，农业必须有相应的发展，工农的联盟关系必须更加巩固，而农业税政策的正确执行，对于发展农业生产和巩固工农联盟，显然都是有重大作用的。因此，对于农业税收政策如不加以正确掌握，就必然会妨害农业生产，妨害工农联盟，就必然要犯严重的政治错误。
    政务院的指示一再强调农业税对国家的重要性，这是我们全体干部和人民群众都应该深刻认识的。指示中说：“在过去革命战争时期，它是我们收入的主要来源。近三年来也因为我们完成了公粮的征收，才顺利地保障了国家收支的平衡，抗美援朝的需要和市场物价的稳定。在今后，随着工业的发展，农业税在国家总收入中所占的比重，虽相对地日渐缩小，但它始终是国家的巨大收入和稳定市场物价、供应军需民食的重大保障。”因此，任何轻视农业税收工作的观点都是非常错误的。
    过去三年来的农业税收，对于平衡国家预算、调剂市场、稳定粮价、保证军需民食和救济灾荒等等，都有巨大作用；在政策执行上，根据合理负担、鼓励增产的原则，并按照农村经济发展的情况，逐步实行了“规定常年应产量、依率计征、依法减免、增产不增税”的政策，这就使农民负担逐渐趋于合理，逐渐稳定和提高了农民生产情绪。因此，一般地检查过去三年来的农业税收政策和农业税收工作，我们应该认为它基本上是有成绩的。但是，这决不是说，我们在农业税政策的执行上就没有缺点和错误。恰恰相反，由于某些领导机关在许多问题上忽视了按照国家的需要和农业生产发展的具体情况来征收农业税的原则，没有对广大干部交代清楚政策界线和工作方法，又没有尽可能地采取各种便利农民的措施，这就助长了某些干部的强迫命令作风的发展。许多干部在工作中缺乏调查研究，对农民缺乏宣传教育，不了解农民生产发展和农民负担能力的具体情况，不善于依靠广大农民的积极性来完成农业税的征收工作，而机械地、片面地追求农业税收的数字，结果造成了农民的负担偏高偏低、依法减免的政策未能正确执行、运粮入库时不断发生人畜伤亡事故等严重现象。我们必须认真执行政务院关于一九五三年农业税工作的指示，坚决克服上述的错误和缺点，进一步把征收农业税的工作做好。
    毛主席历来指示我们，必须在发展经济的基础上来保证供给。现在，政务院关于一九五三年农业税工作的指示明确规定：“今后三年内，农业税的征收指标，应稳定在一九五二年实际征收的水平上，不再增加。”这是极其重要的原则。我们知道，一九五二年的农业生产超过一九五一年，但一九五二年的农业税低于一九五一年，这就相对地减轻了农民的负担。今后三年内把农业税征收指标固定在一九五二年的水平，这在农业生产逐年发展的基础上，必然会进一步相对地减轻农民的负担。这是非常必要的。因为目前广大农民的生活虽比过去改善，但由于多数地区获得解放和完成土地改革较晚，农民生活的变化不会太快，所以距离全体农民丰衣足食还很远。不少农民的生活还相当贫困，多数农民还没有足够的储蓄去抵御严重灾荒的袭击。因此，我们必须采取一切方法，给农民造成能够休养生息的环境和条件，以便发挥农民的生产积极性，增加各种农作物的产量，进一步发展农村经济。在一定时间内固定农业税额，使农民能够掌握自己的田亩产量、应纳税率和税额，从而放手发展生产，更好地安排自己的生活，显然是使农民得以休养生息的极为重要的条件之一。我们只要很好地执行农业税政策，发放农业贷款，帮助农民克服困难，并采取其他奖励和发展农村生产的措施，那末，我国的农业经济一定会逐年增涨起来。
    但是，我们又决不应该把农业税收的这个基本政策和农业税征收的任务对立起来。由于某些领导机关对广大税务工作干部缺乏应有的教育和帮助，许多干部在实际工作中常常把政策和任务对立起来，片面追求“任务”“数字”而放弃和违犯了政策。这是过去农业税政策执行过程中发生各种偏向的最重要的原因之一。这些干部对于政策没有正确的认识，对于完成任务自然也就缺乏正确的态度。应当认识，党和政府规定的政策和任务是完全一致的。农业税的政策和任务都是根据“发展经济，保障供给”的总方针制定出来的。农业税的总的征收指标是以总的方针政策和全国各地的实际情况作根据的。对于依率计征可能征到多少，依法减免可能减去多少，都应有切实的估计。不可能设想，政府会规定并要干部执行一个按照政策就没法完成的任务。可是，在实际工作中，为什么某些干部确实产生了“政策与任务对立”的错觉呢？这主要是因为他们对于实际情况缺乏深入的了解。他们常常一方面把经济作物区的农民的生活或少数富裕农民的生活当作一般农民的生活，或者轻信某些地区夸大灾情、缩小产量的报告；另一方面又要机械地完成征税任务的数字。这样，自然没法正确地执行政策，自然会把对上级负责和对群众负责对立起来。政务院关于一九五三年农业税工作的指示中指出：“不实事求是地按照政策办事，无论达到或超过指标数字，或达不到指标数字，都是错误的。政策必须遵守，任务也要保证完成，两者是统一的，把任务和政策对立起来的看法是错误的，必须改变。”
    怎样才能不重复过去的这个错误呢？这个关键就在于一方面对于政策、任务作正确的理解，一方面对于当时当地的实际情况作深入的全面的调查研究，使政策通过实际情况体现出来。
    为了做好农业税工作，必须和其他一切工作一样，认真地依靠广大群众。“税收工作是伸手向群众要东西的工作，没法走群众路线”的说法是完全错误的。我们必须对广大农民进行关于农业税政策的宣传解释工作，使群众真正明白我们国家的税收政策跟群众的切身利益和长远利益的密切关系，使群众确实了解农业税政策和征收方法的合情合理。只要作到了这一点，只要发动起广大群众来参加农业税的征收工作，那末，关于评议产量、依法减免、运粮入库等工作，就都容易作好了。任何强迫命令的思想作风都是极端缺乏群众观点的表现，是对于我们多年来在农村进行的巨大革命工作、对于我国解放了的农民的政治觉悟的提高缺乏足够估计的结果。过去广大地区农业税征收工作的胜利，都证明了广大农民群众是积极拥护我们的党和人民政府所规定的农业税政策的，是有蓬勃的爱国热情的。农村工作干部和财粮工作人员只要认真采取依靠群众和实事求是的态度和作风，发扬过去在农业税工作中已经积累的经验，切实按照政策办事，那末，今年的农业税征收工作是一定能够胜利完成的。
