Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: According to TASS, the speech made by G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 8th has received great attention in the public opinion of the capitalist world. Newspapers in various countries have published the full text or excerpts of Malenkov's speech. Progressive newspapers in many countries have published editorials commenting on it. Newspapers have attached great importance to Malenkov's remarks on the development of cooperative relations with all countries, considering it as evidence that the Soviet Union is pursuing a policy of peaceful diplomacy.

In Europe, French newspapers published news about Malenkov's speech with large headlines on the 10th. The French Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" published a detailed summary of the speech in two pages, and published an editorial entitled "The Strength of the Soviet Union Serving Peace." When discussing the section of Malenkov's speech on improving Soviet-French relations, the editorial pointed out: "These friendly words will receive a huge response in France." In Italy, public opinion has been discussing Malenkov's speech in recent days. The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "L'Unità" pointed out that this speech is an "embodiment of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy." The Italian Socialist Party's newspaper "Avanti!" said when talking about the section of the speech concerning Italy: "This includes a very clear and sincere proposition: calling for the improvement of our diplomatic and trade relations with the Soviet Union. There is no need to say more about this." In the United Kingdom, the "Daily Worker" reported on Malenkov's speech with a large amount of space. British bourgeois newspapers also published excerpts of the speech. The "Observer," "Sunday Times," and others, in addition to publishing general summaries of the speech, also emphasized Malenkov's statement that the United States is no longer the monopoly holder of the hydrogen bomb. The Austrian Communist Party's newspaper "Volksstimme" and the Finnish Communist Party's newspaper "Kansan Uutiset" also published excerpts of Malenkov's speech. "Kansan Uutiset" pointed out that this speech gives confidence to all peace-loving people and makes them believe that the forces of peace are invincible.

American bourgeois newspapers also paid attention to Malenkov's speech, especially the section about the United States no longer being the monopoly holder of the hydrogen bomb. The "New York Times" said: Some people have long held the illusion that the United States has a monopoly on atomic secrets. If this illusion is used as a guiding principle of American policy today, it would be extremely dangerous.

In Asia, newspapers in Delhi, India, published Malenkov's speech in a prominent position on the 9th. Pakistan's "Today's News" published an editorial saying: Malenkov's speech is a huge encouragement to peace defenders around the world. His statement that the Soviet Union has no intention of aggression against any country is a fatal blow to the evil plans of warmongers. Iran's "Today's East," "Knowledge," and "World News," etc., all published reports on Malenkov's speech on the 9th. Lebanon's "Al-Telegraph" published Malenkov's speech under the headline "Moscow Intends to Strengthen Relations with Arab Countries and Enhance Mutual Understanding between Turkey and Iran." Egypt's "Al-Misri" said that Malenkov's speech was "the most important political event of the year."

    资本主义国家舆论十分重视马林科夫演说
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫八日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的演说，已在资本主义世界的舆论中受到了很大的注意。各国的报纸都全文或摘要刊载了马林科夫的演说。许多国家的进步报纸纷纷发表社论加以评述。各报对马林科夫的演说中关于发展和一切国家的合作关系的言论十分重视，认为这是苏联执行和平外交政策的明证。
    在欧洲，法国各报都在十日以大字标题刊载了关于马林科夫演说的消息。法国共产党机关报“人道报”以两版篇幅刊载了这篇演说的详细摘要，并发表了题为“为和平服务的苏联的力量”的社论。社论在论到马林科夫演说中关于改善苏法关系的一段时指出：“这些充满友情的话将在法国获得巨大的反应。”在意大利，这几天来舆论界人士纷纷讨论了马林科夫的演说。意大利共产党机关报“团结报”指出：这篇演说是苏联“和平政策的体现”。意大利社会党机关报“前进报”在谈到演说中关于意大利的一段时说：“这里包括很明确真诚的主张：号召改善我们与苏联的外交关系和贸易关系。对于这点是不用多说的了。”在英国，“工人日报”以大量篇幅报道了马林科夫的演说。英国资产阶级报纸也发表了这篇演说的摘要。“观察家报”、“星期日泰晤士报”等除了刊载演说的一般摘要以外，还着重指出了马林科夫关于美国不再是氢弹的垄断者的声明。奥地利共产党机关报“奥地利人民之声报”和芬兰共产党机关报“劳动人民报”，也摘要刊载了马林科夫的演说。“劳动人民报”并指出：这篇演说给一切爱好和平的人们以信心，使他们坚信和平力量是不可战胜的。
    美国资产阶级报纸也很注意马林科夫的演说，特别是其中关于美国不再是氢弹的垄断者一段。“纽约时报”说：有人很久以来一直抱着所谓美国垄断原子秘密的幻想，如果今天再以这种幻想作为美国政策的指导原则的话，那是极端危险的了。
    在亚洲，印度德里的报纸都在九日以显著地位刊载了马林科夫的演说。巴基斯坦“今天报”发表社论说：马林科夫的演说是全世界和平保卫者的巨大鼓舞力量。他所发表的苏联对于任何国家没有侵略意图的声明，是对于战争煽动者的罪恶计划的致命的打击。伊朗的“今日东方报”、“知识报”和“世界报”等都在九日刊载了关于马林科夫的演说的报道。黎巴嫩的“电讯报”以“莫斯科打算加强与阿拉伯国家的关系并增进与土耳其和伊朗间的互相了解”为标题，刊载了马林科夫的演说。埃及的“埃及人报”说，马林科夫的演说是“今年最重大的政治事件”。
