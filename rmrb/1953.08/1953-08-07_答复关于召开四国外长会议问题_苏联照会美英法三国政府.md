Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 5th: The embassies of the Soviet Union in Washington, London, and Paris received notes on July 15th from the governments of the United States, Britain, and France regarding the convening of a conference of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.

On August 4th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a reply from the Soviet government to the embassies of the United States, Britain, and France in Moscow.

The following is the original text of the United States government's note of July 15, 1953, and the Soviet government's reply of August 4, 1953.

	United States Government Note of July 15, 1953

The Secretary of State presents his compliments to the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and requests him to convey the following to his Government.

Developments in the international situation and recent events in East Germany and Berlin have made the world even more eager to see peace more firmly established and existing tensions eased in a manner consistent with fundamental freedoms.

The United States Government believes that lasting peace can ultimately be assured only when certain fundamental issues, such as supervised arms reductions, are addressed, but it also expresses its hope to address issues that can be resolved at an early date.

The conclusion of the long-delayed peace treaty with Germany and the peace treaty with Austria would clearly be necessary factors for the settlement of European problems, and the United States Government believes that the settlement of European problems would be a major contribution to peace.

Negotiating a peace treaty with Germany requires the participation of a free and representative all-German government, which must be able to participate freely in discussions of such a treaty. Such a government can only be formed through free elections.

The question of the conditions required for the establishment of such a government and for that government to enjoy full freedom of action is a question that can be resolved at an early date if all parties are sincere. It is equally clear that until this issue is resolved, there will be no real progress in the general easing of tensions in Europe.

The United States Government has addressed numerous notes to the Soviet Government, the last of which was issued on September 23, 1952, and has not yet received a reply. In these notes, the United States Government has put forward constructive proposals, which are fully reflected in the resolution passed by the German Federal Parliament on June 10 this year. These proposals are aimed at satisfying the unanimous desire of the German people for free unification.

The United States Government, noting that recent events have made the question of German unification even more urgent, has decided to make another effort to end the abnormal position in which the German people find themselves. Therefore, after consulting with the German Federal Government and the German authorities in Berlin, they have decided to propose to the Soviet Government the holding of a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The meeting would take place around the end of September at a location agreed upon by all parties. The topics for discussion are as follows:

1. Organizing free elections in the Federal Republic, the Eastern Zone of Germany, and Berlin. To this end, it is necessary, while discussing other issues, to discuss how to provide the necessary guarantees to ensure freedom of movement for the people, freedom of activity for political parties, freedom of the press, and all fundamental freedoms for all Germans before, during, and after the elections.

2. Conditions for establishing an all-German government that can have freedom of action in domestic and foreign affairs.

This is an important step that must be taken before discussions with the Soviet Government can begin on a peace treaty with Germany - an important element in the overall solution.

The United States Government also believes that at this first meeting, a final agreement must also be reached on the Austrian peace treaty.

	Soviet Government Note of August 4, 1953

The Soviet Government received on July 15 the note from the United States Government, and also received the notes from the British and French Governments, and learned that the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and France decided at the Washington Conference in July to convene a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the above three countries and the Soviet Union. The notes notified the agenda proposed by the three Foreign Ministers, as well as the date for convening the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.

From the above, it can be seen that the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and France, in violation of international practice, independently and in advance discussed the issue of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference without the participation of a Soviet representative. This situation cannot be considered normal. Moreover, this is clearly contrary to existing agreements on foreign ministers' meetings. Furthermore, the premeditation of the three foreign ministers may have a negative impact on the entire process of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Such a conclusion is naturally drawn from the fact that the three countries participating in the Washington Conference mutually bound each other in advance with various separate agreements, and did not even - as has happened repeatedly in the past - want to attempt a free discussion of pressing international issues, unbound by any unilateral obligations.

In the current international situation, holding meetings of major powers is of great significance for resolving issues in international disputes. It is precisely now, thanks to the efforts of peace-loving countries, that the cessation of the Korean War and the signing of the armistice agreement have created favorable conditions for easing international tensions. Needless to say, the successful completion of this task still depends on the efforts of all peace-loving countries, large and small. However, the responsibility for maintaining peace and international security, as stated in the United Nations Charter, rests primarily with the five major powers - the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China. Ignoring this situation is not conducive to maintaining and strengthening peace and international security; on the other hand, giving some special significance to developments such as the fascist adventures launched in Berlin on June 17 by foreign mercenaries and criminals means harboring illusions and diverting attention from truly important facts that have a positive significance for easing international tensions.

In view of the above considerations, the Soviet Government advocates that the Foreign Ministers' Conference discuss measures to promote the general easing of international tensions, including the reduction of armaments and the issue of not allowing foreign countries to build military bases on the territory of other countries. Moreover, the question of who can participate in the discussion of certain international issues may also be discussed at this meeting.

The discussion of the above issues is necessary not only because of the situation in Europe. Everyone knows that important and pressing issues in the situation in Asian countries also attract international attention. Therefore, it is also necessary for the People's Republic of China to participate in discussions on easing international tensions. The great Chinese people, more closely united than ever before in the People's Republic of China, have every reason to demand the restoration of their legitimate rights in all international affairs. Ignoring the importance of immediately resolving this issue is detrimental to strengthening peace and international security.

Regarding the United States government's note of July 15, the Soviet government expresses its agreement to discuss the German issue at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, the United States' note of July 15, like the communiqué issued by the Three Foreign Ministers' Washington Conference, is not actually intended to conduct a genuine discussion on the German issue, but rather to reduce the entire issue to a repeated presentation of the proposals made by the United States in its note of September 23 last year. That proposal considered it unnecessary to solve the fundamental problems of Germany.

Everyone knows that what the German people are primarily concerned with is the resolution of issues such as the unification of Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty. However, the United States' note of July 15 avoided addressing the resolution of these fundamental German issues, while mentioning the United States' note of September 23, 1952, which also disregarded the need to resolve these fundamental issues. Instead of addressing the resolution of these fundamental German issues, the United States government's note of July 15 substitutes a proposal for all-German elections, which, according to the United States' note of September 23 last year, is again replaced by a proposal to establish a so-called neutral investigation committee composed of foreign representatives to create conditions for the elections. From this, it can be seen that the United States' note of July 15 has no intention of promoting the resolution of fundamental German issues, but rather wants to transform this matter into a long-term discussion, namely, discussing whether representatives of certain countries should participate in the investigation of the German situation and the methods and purposes of conducting this investigation, which is insulting to the German people. If such a proposal is adopted, it will not achieve any results, but will only call on everyone to conduct fruitless negotiations on these issues, a negotiation that cannot determine anything.

All this determines the Soviet government's attitude towards the above-mentioned proposal of the United States government.

The Soviet government believes that such a proposal will not only fail to promote the unification of Germany and the establishment of an all-German democratic government, but will also keep Germany divided into east and west and, as in the past, delay the conclusion of a peace treaty. At the same time, the United States is taking measures to remilitarize West Germany, the danger of which will not be unknown to the peace-loving people of Europe, especially the people of Germany's neighboring countries. If, as stated in the United States' note of July 15, these tasks are carried out in coordination and consultation with the Adenauer Bonn government, it will only lead the German people to lose trust in such a government, not to mention the people of other countries in Europe.

Despite the above-mentioned opinions on the United States government's note of July 15, the Soviet government still attaches great importance to the joint discussion of the German issue by major powers, and hopes that this discussion can provide a possibility to comprehensively study issues related to the restoration of German unification, and can help strengthen European peace with the resolution of the issue of the German peace treaty.

Therefore, the Soviet government suggests:

(1) In view of the above points, the Foreign Ministers' Conference should discuss ways to ease international tensions;

(2) The conference should discuss the German issue, including the restoration of German unification and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

Regarding the Austrian peace treaty, the Soviet government has already stated its position on this issue in notes sent separately to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on July 30. Needless to say, if the German issue can be resolved, it will help resolve the Austrian issue.

The Soviet government also sent the same note to the British and French governments.

    答复关于召开四国外长会议问题
    苏联照会美英法三国政府
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日电：七月十五日，苏联驻华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎的大使馆收到了美国、英国、法国政府关于召开美国、英国、法国、苏联四国外长会议的照会。
    八月四日，苏联外交部以苏联政府的复文一件送交美国、英国、法国驻在莫斯科的大使馆。
    以下是美国政府一九五三年七月十五日的照会原文和苏联政府一九五三年八月四日的复文。
        美国政府一九五三年七月十五日的照会
    国务卿向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟临时代办致意，并要求他将以下所述转告他的政府。
    国际局势的发展和最近在东德与柏林发生的事件使全世界更加迫切地希望看到和平更稳固地建立起来，希望用符合基本自由权利的方式，缓和现存紧张局势。
    美国政府认为，只有在某些基本问题，例如有监督地裁减军备这样的问题，得到处理的时候，持久和平才能最终得到保障，但它同时表示希望立刻处理那些能够早日解决的问题。
    缔结拖延了许久的对德和约与对奥和约显然将是欧洲问题得到解决的必要因素，美国政府认为，欧洲问题解决将是对和平的重大贡献。
    要谈判对德和约，就必须有一个自由的、有代表性的全德政府参与，这个政府必须能够自由地参加讨论这样一个条约。而只有举行自由选举，才能成立这样一个政府。
    成立这样一个政府以及这个政府要享有充分的行动自由所需要的条件的问题，是一个只要各方都有诚意就能够早日得到解决的问题。同样显明的是：这个问题一天得不到解决，在欧洲紧张局势的普遍缓和方面就一天不会有真正的进展。
    美国政府以前曾多次向苏联政府提出照会，其中最后的一次照会是一九五二年九月二十三日发出的，至今还未收到答复。在这多次照会中，美国政府提出了建设性的建议，这些建议充分地反映在德意志联邦议院今年六月十日通过的决议中。这些建议的目的是满足德国人民要求自由地统一的一致愿望的。
    美国政府注意到最近发生的事件使德国的统一问题更形迫切，决定再一次进行努力，以结束德国人民所处的不正常的地位。因此，在咨询了德意志联邦政府和柏林德国当局以后，他们决定向苏联政府提议举行法国、英国、美国和苏联的外交部长会议。会议大概将于九月末在各方所同意的地点举行。讨论的题目如下：
    一、组织联邦共和国、德国东区和柏林的自由选举。为此，就必须在讨论其他问题的同时，讨论如何提供必要的保证，保证人民移动自由，各政党的活动自由，新闻自由以及全体德国人在选举之前，选举当中和选举以后的一切基本自由。
    二、建立一个在内政外交上能有行动自由的全德政府的条件。
    这是一个重要的步骤，必须先走了这一步而后才能开始和苏联政府讨论对德和约——这件事本身也是全面解决中的一个重要因素。
    美国政府也认为，在这第一次的会议上，也必需在对奥和约上最后取得协议。
        一九五三年八月四日苏联政府的照会
    苏联政府在七月十五日收到了美国政府的照会，同时也收到了英国和法国政府的照会，得知美国、英国和法国外交部长在七月间的华盛顿会议上决定召开上述三国和苏联外交部长的会议。照会通知了三国外长所提议的议程，以及召开美国、英国、法国和苏联外交部长会议的日期。
    从上面所说的来看，美国、英国和法国的外交部长违反了国际惯例，在没有苏联代表参加的情况下，自行预先讨论了关于四国外交部长会议的问题。这种情形不能被认为是正常的。并且，这显然是与现存的关于外长会议的协定背道而驰的。此外，三国外交部长的预谋可能对四国外交部长会议的整个过程起一种消极的作用。这样的一个结论是很自然地由以下的事实所作出来的，就是，参加华盛顿会议的三个国家预先就以各种单独的协议互相约束，甚至——正如以往屡次所发生的情形一样——不想尝试对迫切的国际问题进行一次自由的、不受任何片面义务约束的讨论。
    在目前的国际情势之下，举行大国会议对于解决国际争执中的问题是具有重大意义的。正是在目前，由于爱好和平国家的努力，已经实现了停止朝鲜战争和签订停战协定的时候，缓和国际紧张局势已经有了有利的条件。不用说，胜利地完成这一任务还得靠所有爱好和平的、大大小小的国家的努力。可是，维持和平与国际安全的责任，如联合国宪章所说，主要是在五大国——美国、英国、法国、苏联和中华人民共和国身上。无视这种情况对于维持和加强和平与国际安全是没有好处的，在另一方面，对于像外国雇佣者和罪恶分子六月十七日在柏林所发动的法西斯冒险这样的发展，给予某种特殊的意义，是意味着怀抱幻想，转移对于真正重要的，对缓和国际紧张局势有积极意义的事实的注意。
    鉴于以上的考虑，苏联政府主张外长会议讨论促使国际紧张关系得到普遍缓和的措施，包括裁减军备与不准许外国在他国领土上建筑军事基地问题。而且，关于某些国际问题的讨论什么人可以参加的问题，也不妨在这次会上讨论。
    讨论上述问题之所以必要不仅是由于欧洲局势。人人都知道，亚洲国家局势中的重要迫切问题也吸引着国际间的重视。因此，中华人民共和国参加关于缓和国际紧张局势问题的讨论也是必要的。比以往任何时候都更加紧密地团结在中华人民共和国里的伟大的中国人民，有充分的理由要求恢复他们在一切国际事务中的合法权利。如果忽视立即解决这个问题的重要性，是不利于加强和平与国际安全的。
    关于美国政府七月十五日的照会，苏联政府表示同意在外长会议上讨论德国问题。但是，美国七月十五日的照会，正如三外长华盛顿会议所发表的公报一样，实际上并不是想就德国问题进行真正的讨论，而是把整个问题缩小为重复提出美国在去年九月二十三日的照会中所提出的建议。那个建议认为没有必要解决德国的根本问题。
    人人都知道，德国人民首先关心的是像统一德国和缔结和约这样一些问题的解决。但是，美国在今年七月十五日的照会中对德国这些根本问题的解决避而不谈，同时却提到了美国一九五二年九月二十三日的照会，那个照会也无视解决这些根本问题的必要性。美国政府七月十五日的照会不谈解决德国这些根本问题，而代之以一项关于全德选举的建议，而选举问题本身，根据美国去年九月二十三日的照会，又为一项成立由外国代表组成的所谓中立调查委员会来为选举创造条件的建议所代替了。由此可见，美国七月十五日的照会根本无意促进德国根本问题的解决，而是想把这件事情化为长期的讨论，即讨论某些国家的代表是否应该参加德国情况的调查以及进行这种侮辱德国人民的调查的方式和目的之类问题。如果采用这样的建议，决不会得到什么结果，只是叫大家对这些问题进行无益的谈判，进行一场不能确定任何事情的谈判而已。
    这一切决定了苏联政府对美国政府上述建议的态度。
    苏联政府认为，这样的建议不仅不能促成德国的统一和全德民主政府的成立，而且会使德国保持东西两部的分裂局面，并像以往一样延缓和约的缔结。与此同时，美国正采取措施使西德重新军国主义化，其危险是欧洲爱好和平的人民、特别是德国邻国的人民所不会不知道的。如果，如美国七月十五日的照会中所说，在阿登纳波恩政府的配合与咨询下进行这些工作，最后只会使德国人民失去对这样一个政府的信任，欧洲其他国家人民更不用说。
    尽管对美国政府七月十五日的照会有上述意见，苏联政府还是十分重视由大国共同讨论德国问题，并希望这个讨论能够提供一种可能性来全面研究与恢复与德国统一有关的问题，并且能够随着对德和约问题的解决，帮助加强欧洲和平。
    因此，苏联政府建议：
    （一）鉴于上述各点，在外长会议上讨论缓和国际紧张局势的办法；
    （二）在会议上讨论德国问题，包括恢复德国统一和缔结对德和约问题。
    关于对奥和约，苏联政府已在七月三十日分别致美、英、法三国政府的照会中表明了对这个问题的态度。不用说，如果德国问题能够解决，对奥国问题的解决是会有帮助的。
    苏联政府也以同样的照会送交英法两国政府。
