    Editor's Note: Recently, we have received many letters from readers reflecting shortcomings in letter delivery by post offices in various regions – among the more common being backlog, misdelivery of letters, and loss of remittances. It should be pointed out that the work of the Chinese People's Postal Service has been successful; however, due to the lack of a strong sense of responsibility among some postal workers, there are still quite a few errors and backlogs in letter delivery. This situation is harmful to the work of the state and the interests of the people, and also damages the reputation of the People's Postal Service. We are now publishing excerpts of relevant readers' letters to encourage postal organizations in various regions to strengthen the political and ideological education of their employees, and to mobilize employees to further eliminate errors and backlogs, so that letter delivery can be as prompt, accurate, and secure as possible.

    The Xikang Postal and Telecommunications Bureau Should Seriously Handle the Error of the Yanyuan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Backlogging Letters
    A letter from Hu Zhi and five others from the Yanyuan County People's Government, Xikang Province: The backlog of mail at the Yanyuan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Xikang is very serious, creating an extremely negative impact among the masses. Many families of revolutionary soldiers in the area are very anxious because they have not received letters from their loved ones in the military for a long time, and they have been asking the Civil Affairs Section of the Yanyuan County People's Government. After an investigation by the Civil Affairs Section, it was discovered that these letters had been backlogged at the Yanyuan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau. According to statistics, from December of last year to June of this year, the bureau backlogged one hundred and eleven letters, including forty-eight letters from volunteers, forty-six letters from the People's Liberation Army, seven letters from the Public Security Forces, and ten letters from government cadres. Among these letters, fifty-four included money orders, thirty-four were registered letters with dual receipts, and twenty-one were registered letters with a single receipt. After the above situation was discovered, the Yanyuan County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau not only did not humbly examine its mistakes, but instead tried to shirk responsibility by claiming that they had "notified the township government." However, in fact, many letters to recipients living in areas adjacent to the post office were also backlogged. For example, the homes of military families Wang Liansheng and Qiu Bingyin are both near the post office, and letters sent by their sons from Korea clearly stated the names and addresses of the recipients; the letters arrived at the Yanyuan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau at the end of May, but were never delivered to their homes until they were discovered during this inspection.

    The error of the Yanyuan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in arbitrarily backlogging letters from revolutionary soldiers is serious. It is hoped that the Xikang Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau will conduct an in-depth inspection of the work of the Yanyuan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, promptly correct this phenomenon that harms the interests of the people, and seriously handle those responsible for dereliction of duty.

    A Misdelivered Letter Was Passed Back and Forth Through Several Post Offices Without Anyone Noticing
    A letter from Wei Yinru, Mail Order Group, Beijing Branch of the China Book Company: On March 28th, I sent a letter from Beijing to Wei Aijuan, Sisang Village, Shulu County, Shide Line (Shijiazhuang to Dezhou), with the addresses of both the sender and recipient clearly written. Who knew that this letter would be transferred back and forth through the post office, with layers of endorsements, and after traveling for more than three months, it would be returned to me unopened.

    How did the post office handle this letter? I clearly wrote on the envelope that it was to be delivered to Sisang Village, Shulu County, Shide Line, but they sent it to the Logistics Department of the East China Military Region; the department naturally did not accept the letter. Therefore, the letter was returned to the original delivery bureau, the 18th Branch of the Beijing Post Office. Strangely, the 18th Branch did not check the reason for the return, but instead put it in the post office for unclaimed items for two months, and then put a note on the letter that said "unclaimed after expiration date," and sent it to the Undeliverable Mail Section of the Beijing Post Office. The Undeliverable Mail Section returned the original letter to me, and also attached a mimeographed note asking me to write the address clearly in the future; it is clear that the Undeliverable Mail Section also did not carefully check this letter.

    I think that the post office's careless work style is intolerable. I hope that they will conduct an inspection and quickly correct it.

    A Sum of Money Remitted from the Xian County Post Office Has Been Lost for More Than a Year and Cannot Be Located
    A letter from Zhao Pingshu, a reader at Xian County Middle School, Hebei Province: On April 17th of last year, I was entrusted by a student to remit 15,000 yuan to the "North China People" magazine in Beijing through the Xian County Post Office in Hebei to subscribe to the magazine. The letter was sent by registered mail, and the remittance receipt number was 147. A month later, the student had not received the magazine, so I went to the Xian County Post Office to inquire. The person in charge of the post office said: "Let me check it for you." More than a month later, the magazine still had not arrived, so I went to the post office again; the post office again used "Let me check it" as an excuse. Subsequently, I wrote to the "North China People" magazine to inquire, and the magazine replied: "We have not received the money or the letter." I went to the post office again to inquire, and the post office comrades asked me to pay a "receipt fee" to trace the whereabouts of the remittance. But after another two or three months, the magazine was still nowhere to be seen. I had no choice but to send the remittance stub to the "North China People" magazine and ask them to inquire at the receiving post office. Later, the magazine replied that they could not find it. I went to the Xian County Post Office again to inquire, and they still said: "Wait! We have investigated with the General Administration, and there will be a reply soon." The result was that it was delayed month after month, and now it has been more than a year, and the remittance is still missing. Although this is a small matter, and the amount of the remittance is not large, I have run to the post office more than ten times for this, written several inquiry letters, and paid a "receipt fee" once, but the post office has never given me a satisfactory answer. I find it very strange that the post office cannot find the result even after losing a registered remittance. I hope they will carefully check their work and improve their work style.

    A Letter Addressed to the Public Security Bureau of Liaodong Province Was Sent to the Public Security Bureau of Guangdong Province
    A letter from Liu Xiankun, Political Department of the Public Security Bureau of Guangdong Province: I have found that the post office often misdelivers letters. On July 25th of this year, we received a letter from the Suxinyao Factory in Meihekou, Liaodong Province, addressed to Li, Section Chief of the Finance Section, Fourth Division, Public Security Bureau of the Liaodong Provincial People's Government, sent by the Guangzhou Post Office. Although this letter passed through the hands of several post office workers, none of them noticed that the letter was misdirected, and it was finally sent to our office.

    After we received this letter, we initially thought that the sending unit had sent the letter to our department and had written the name of the receiving unit incorrectly on the envelope (i.e., had mistakenly written "Guangdong" as "Liaodong"), but when we opened it, we found that the letter was actually written by the Suxinyao Factory to the Public Security Bureau of the Liaodong Provincial People's Government, and the content was to request prompt instructions on how to handle the treatment of workers at the kiln factory who were ill; the letter also included a receipt for 500 million yuan. Although we immediately returned the original letter to the post office, the misdelivery of this letter greatly lengthened its travel time; in this way, the kiln factory could not receive instructions from higher authorities in time, and the treatment of workers' illnesses could not be resolved quickly, which could cause huge losses to work.

    In addition, we often find that the post office mistakenly sends letters addressed to the Public Security Bureau of Guangxi Province to us. There are many similar examples, and I will not list them one by one.

    I suggest that postal departments in various regions must strengthen the political and ideological education of their staff, strengthen their sense of responsibility, so as to eliminate errors in their work and do a good job in the people's postal service.

### 各地邮政机构应该进一步做好信件投递工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    各地邮政机构应该进一步做好信件投递工作
    编者按：最近我们收到不少读者来信，反映各地邮局在信件投递工作中的一些缺点——其中比较普遍的是积压、错投信件以及丢失汇款等现象。应该指出，中国人民邮政事业的工作是有成绩的；但是，由于某些邮政工作人员责任心不够强，目前信件投递工作中的差错和积压现象还很不少。这种情况对国家工作和人民利益都是有害的，也损害了人民邮政事业的信誉。现在我们把有关这方面的读者来信选择一部分摘要发表，希望各地邮政机构加强对职工的政治思想教育，发动职工进一步消灭差错和积压现象，使信件投递工作尽量做到迅速、准确、安全。
    西康邮电管理局应严肃处理
    盐源邮电局积压信件的错误
    西康省盐源县人民政府胡智等六人来信：西康盐源邮电局积压邮件的情况很严重，在群众中造成极端恶劣的影响。当地很多革命军人家属因为长期没有收到军人的来信，感到很焦急，纷纷到盐源县人民政府民政科询问。经过民政科的调查，才发现这些信件原来都被积压在盐源邮电局内。据统计，从去年十二月到今年六月份该局积压了一百十一封信，其中有志愿军的信四十八件，解放军的信四十六件，公安部队的信七件，机关干部的信十件。这些信件中，内附汇票的五十四件，双挂号信三十四件，单挂号信二十一件。以上情况被发现后，盐源县邮电局不但不虚心检查错误，反而以“曾通知乡政府”为藉口，企图推卸责任。但是事实上，有许多收信人就住在邮局邻近地区的信件也被积压着。如军属王连生及邱丙银的家都在邮局附近，他们的儿子从朝鲜寄回信来，收信人姓名地址都写得很清楚；信件在五月底就到达了盐源邮电局，却一直没有被送到他们家里，直到这次检查时才被发现。
    盐源邮电局任意积压革命军人家信的错误是严重的。希望西康省邮电管理局对盐源邮电局的工作进行深入检查，迅速纠正这种违害人民利益的现象，并严肃处理失职人员。
    一封错投信件经过往返传递几个邮局竟都没有发现
    中国图书公司北京分公司邮购组魏隐儒来信：三月二十八日，我在北京发给石（家庄）德（州）线束鹿县泗上村魏爱娟一封信，收信人和发信人的地址都写得很清楚。谁知道这封信经过邮局的往返转递，层层签注，旅行了三个多月后又原封不动地退回来了。
    邮局是怎样处理这封信的呢？我在信封上明明写的是寄交石德线束鹿县泗上村，他们却给我投到华东军区后方勤务部去了；该部当然不收这封信。于是，这封信就被退到原投递局北京邮局十八支局。奇怪的是，十八支局并不检查这封信退回的原因，却把它放在邮局内招领了两个月，然后在信上贴了“招领过期”的纸条，又送到北京邮局无着邮件股处理。无着邮件股就把原信退给了我，并且在信上又贴上了一张油印纸条，要我以后写信把地址写清楚；可见无着邮件股也并没有细心检查这封信。
    我认为邮局这种粗枝大叶的工作作风是令人不能容忍的。希望他们进行检查并迅速改正。
    在献县邮局汇出一笔款
    遗失一年多查不到下落
    河北省献县中学读者赵平舒来信：去年四月十七日，我受一位学生的委托，在河北献县邮局汇款一万五千元给北京“华北人民”杂志社，向该社订阅杂志，信是挂号发出的，汇执号码是一百四十七号。过了一个月，这个学生并没有接到杂志，我就到献县邮局去查问。邮局负责同志说：“给你查一查吧。”又隔了一个多月，杂志仍没有寄来，我再到邮局去问；邮局又以“查一查”来敷衍。随后，我向“华北人民”杂志社去信打听，该社来信说：“款和信都没有见到。”我又去邮局追问，邮局同志要我付出一份“回执费”，替我追查汇款下落。但是又过了两三个月，杂志依然没有影子。我没有办法，只得将汇票存根寄给“华北人民”杂志社，请他们到收款邮局查询一下。后来该社来信说是没有查到。我再到献县邮局查问，他们还是说：“等着吧！我们已向总局调查了，不久就有答复。”结果是一月一月的拖延下去，到现在已有一年多的时间，汇款仍旧没有下落。这虽然是件小事，汇款的数目也不大；但是我为此到邮局跑了十余次，写了好几封查问信，还付了一次“回执费”，邮局却始终没有给我一个圆满的答复。我很奇怪，邮局在遗失挂号寄递的汇款后，竟然还会查不到结果。希望他们好好检查一下工作，改进工作作风。
    一封寄给辽东省公安厅的信
    送到广东省公安厅来了
    广东省人民政府公安厅政治部刘贤坤来信：我发现邮局经常错投信件。今年七月二十五日，我们收到广州邮局送来的一封辽东省梅河口苏新窑厂寄给辽东省人民政府公安厅第四处财务科李科长的信。这封信虽然经过几个邮局工作人员的手，他们却都没有发现信件投递路线错了，最后就被送到我们机关来了。
    我们收到这封信后，开始还以为这封信是发信单位寄给我厅而在信封上把收信单位的名称写错了（即把“广东”错写成“辽东”），但拆开一看，原来这封信是苏新窑厂写给辽东省人民政府公安厅的，内容是要求迅速指示有关窑厂工作人员疾病治疗问题的处理办法；信内并附有五亿元的收据一纸。我们虽然立即把原信退回邮局，但是由于这封信投递错误，大大延长了它在路上往返的时间；这样，该窑厂就不能及时得到上级的指示，而使工作人员疾病治疗问题得不到迅速解决，可能使工作受到巨大的损失。
    此外，我们还经常发现邮局把旁人寄给广西省公安厅的信件错送到我们这里。类似这样的例子很多，不再一一举出了。
    我建议各地邮政部门必须加强对所属工作人员的政治思想教育，加强他们的责任心，以消灭工作中的差错，做好人民邮政工作。
