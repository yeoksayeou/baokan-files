The Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, led by Chief Representative General Li Zhimin, was also invited to participate.

The Korean Workers' Party Central Headquarters Grand Hall, where the meeting was held, was decorated solemnly and splendidly. This magnificent building, which can accommodate more than 800 people, was rushed to completion in just over half a month after the Korean armistice. Huge portraits of Kim Il-sung, Malenkov, and Mao Zedong and the national flags of Korea, the Soviet Union, and China hung on the rostrum.

At 8 o'clock sharp, when the presidium headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung appeared on the rostrum, the entire audience stood up and cheered and applauded in unison. At this moment, two Young Pioneers ran onto the rostrum to present flowers to Marshal Kim Il-sung and Soviet Ambassador to Korea, Suzdalev.

The entire audience stood up in unison.

Park Chang-ok, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, delivered a report at the meeting. He said: After the great Soviet army drove out the Japanese imperialists from our country and liberated Korea, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Labor Party and the Korean people's leader Comrade Kim Il-sung, struggled for the peaceful reunification of the motherland; with the assistance of the great Soviet Union, a strong democratic base was established in the northern half of Korea in less than five years after liberation. Now, the Korean people have achieved a historic and great victory in the war against the armed aggression of US imperialism. This is a great victory for the peace and democracy camp.

Park Chang-ok pointed out: The assistance given to us Korean people by the people of the fraternal countries of the peace and democracy camp is one of the basic conditions for ensuring our victory. When he emphatically pointed out that the Korean people should express the gratitude of the entire nation to their liberator, the great Soviet people and their leader Comrade Malenkov, and to the great Chinese people and their leader Chairman Mao Zedong, who sent the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to aid the Korean people with blood in the Korean people's anti-aggression war, the entire audience stood up in unison, erupting in enthusiastic cheers and thunderous applause. He called on all Korean people to rise up in unison and respond to Marshal Kim Il-sung's instructions to "do everything to strengthen the democratic base and restore and develop the post-war people's economy," to maintain a fighting posture forever on the front of restoration and construction, and to advance bravely. At the same time, continue to heighten vigilance and prepare to crush any provocative actions by the enemy.

After the report, Soviet Ambassador to Korea, Suzdalev, stepped onto the stage to deliver a congratulatory speech.

Then, General Li Zhimin, Chief Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, presented a large banner on behalf of Commander Peng Dehuai and all commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Marshal Kim Il-sung personally accepted it. The entire audience stood up and cheered and applauded, which lasted for a long time.

Finally, the meeting unanimously adopted a congratulatory telegram to Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, amidst thunderous applause.

After the meeting, celebratory programs were performed by the Korean National Art Theater and the Choi Seung-hee Dance Research Institute.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 15th: The people of Kaesong City warmly celebrated the eighth anniversary of the "August 15th" Korean Liberation Day today.

In the early morning, all agencies, organizations, and residents proudly hung the national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and people put on the beautiful clothes they had saved during the war.

At 11 a.m., a celebration rally of 30,000 people was held in Kaesong Square. Yu Pei-mu, Chairman of the Kaesong City Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, spoke at the meeting, thanking the great Soviet army on behalf of the people of Kaesong City for liberating the northern half of the motherland from Japanese imperialism, and thanking the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army for fighting side by side to repel the crazy offensive of US imperialism and achieving the Korean armistice. He stated that the people of Kaesong will definitely restore and develop production with all their strength, rebuild their homes, and at the same time be vigilant against the aggressors' conspiracy to re-launch the war, and strive for the peace, democracy, and unification of the motherland.

After the meeting, a grand demonstration parade was held. The workers' teams held hammers and shovels, expressing their determination to build Kaesong better than before the war. The farmers held sickles and shouted slogans to strive for more grain production. The energetic student and youth teams expressed that they are always ready to participate in the sacred cause of building and defending the motherland. The most eye-catching were the lovely children, who held peace doves and flowers, singing and dancing. They hope that there will never be a threat of war again.

The people of Kaesong City will hold a series of celebratory sports meets and evening parties for the next three days.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 15th: In order to commemorate the immortal feat of the great Soviet army liberating Korea from Japanese imperialist rule eight years ago today, more than 300 representatives from all walks of life in Pyongyang presented wreaths to the "Liberation Memorial Tower" at 5 p.m. on the 14th to pay their respects. Those who went to present wreaths included: Park Jung-ai, Park Chang-ok, and Kim Il, Vice-Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party; Jung Il-ryong, Vice-Premier of the Cabinet; Jung Jun-taek, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Cabinet; Heo Jeong-suk, Minister of Culture and Propaganda; Lee Byung-nam, Minister of Health and other party and government leaders; heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations; representatives of the Korean People's Army; and representatives of workers, peasants, women, youth, and students in the Pyongyang area, as well as people's visiting groups from various places who came to the democratic capital of Pyongyang for sightseeing. Also present to present wreaths were Soviet Ambassador to Korea, Suzdalev, Chargé d'Affaires Gan Ye Tao of the Chinese Embassy, and diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various people's democratic countries.

The tall "Liberation Memorial Tower" stands on Moranbong Hill in the central district of Pyongyang. In the Korean people's anti-aggression war, thousands of buildings and residential houses in Pyongyang were bombed or destroyed by the US aggressor air force, but the "Liberation Memorial Tower," which symbolizes victory and national freedom and independence, has always stood tall, encouraging the Korean people to move from victory to victory. When the anti-aggression war has ended with a glorious victory, the working people of the hero city of Pyongyang, when drinking water, remember its source. They returned victoriously from the valleys, kilns, basements, or earth caves, and first went to Moranbong Hill to admire the majestic appearance of the "Liberation Memorial Tower." After the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the working people of Pyongyang began to clean up the scenic area around the "Liberation Memorial Tower," and the electricians installed electric lights on the tower. On the eve of "August 15th," the five-pointed star on the top of the tower and the four strings of electric lights running through the tower, like fire dragons, radiated light. People gathering from all directions to Pyongyang, preparing to participate in the "August 15th" demonstration parade, sang "Patriotic Songs" and joyfully marched from afar towards the radiant "Liberation Memorial Tower."

    八时正，当以金日成元帅为首的主席团出现在主席台上时，全场一致起立欢呼、鼓掌。此时，两个少年团员跑上主席台向金日成元帅和苏联驻朝鲜大使苏兹达列夫献花。

    朴昌玉指出：和平民主阵营各兄弟国家人民给予我们朝鲜人民的援助，是保证我们取得胜利的基本条件之一。当他强调指出朝鲜人民要向自己的解放者——伟大的苏联人民及其领袖马林科夫同志和在朝鲜人民反侵略战争中派遣中国人民志愿军以鲜血援助朝鲜人民的伟大的中国人民及其领袖毛泽东主席致以全民族的感谢时，全场一致起立，腾起了热烈欢呼声和雷动的鼓掌声。他号召全朝鲜人民一致奋起，响应金日成元帅“一切为了加强民主基地，恢复和发展战后人民经济”的指示，在恢复和建设的战线上永远保持战斗姿态，奋勇前进。同时，继续提高警惕，做好粉碎敌人任何挑衅行动的准备。

    开城市人民在今后三天内，将连续举行庆祝的运动会和晚会。
    【新华社平壤十五日电】为了纪念伟大的苏联军队在八年前的今天从日本帝国主义统治下解放了朝鲜的不朽功勋，平壤市各界代表三百多人在十四日下午五时向“解放纪念塔”呈献花圈致敬。前往呈献花圈的有：朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、朴昌玉、金一，内阁副首相郑一龙，内阁国家计划委员会委员长郑准泽，文化宣传相许贞琡，保健相李炳南等党、政首长，各民主党派，人民团体负责人，朝鲜人民军代表和平壤地区工人、农民、妇女、青年、学生代表及来民主首都平壤观光的各地人民参观团等。前往呈献花圈的还有驻朝鲜的苏联大使苏兹达列夫、中国大使馆代办甘野陶及各人民民主国家使节和外交官员等。
    高大的“解放纪念塔”矗立在平壤市中心区的牡丹峰上。在朝鲜人民反侵略战争中，平壤市的千万幢建筑物和居民房舍横遭美国侵略空军炸毁或破坏，但是，象征着胜利和民族自由、独立的“解放纪念塔”却始终巍然屹立，它鼓舞朝鲜人民从胜利走向胜利。当反侵略战争已经以辉煌的胜利而告终结的时候，英雄城——平壤的劳动人民饮水思源，他们从山沟里、窑洞里、地下室里或土窟里凯旋回来，首先走到牡丹峰上去瞻仰“解放纪念塔”的雄姿。在朝鲜停战协定签订之后，平壤市劳动人民就纷纷动手把“解放纪念塔”前后左右的风景区打扫得干干净净，电气工人在塔上装配电灯。“八·一五”前夕，塔顶上的五角星和纵贯塔身的四条电灯串，像火龙一样，放射着光芒。从四方八面向平壤市集中，准备参加“八·一五”示威游行的人们唱着“爱国歌”，欢欣鼓舞地从遥远的地方朝着光芒四射的“解放纪念塔”行进。
