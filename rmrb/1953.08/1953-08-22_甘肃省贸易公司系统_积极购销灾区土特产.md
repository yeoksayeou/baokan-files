Gansu Province Trade Company System

Actively Purchases and Sells Native Products from Disaster Areas

Gansu Province experienced little snow last winter and little rain this spring, with some areas experiencing severe disasters. In order to support farmers in disaster areas to overcome the famine, trade companies and stores throughout the province, in conjunction with the specific conditions of their regions, are using various methods to carry out the purchase of local specialties. For example, the Wuwei Branch Trading Group, in coordination with cooperatives and private merchants, held short-distance material exchange meetings in Jingbian District and Zhangyi District (both severely affected areas), with transactions totaling 278 million yuan. Among them, native products accounted for 112 million yuan, enabling disaster-stricken people to exchange their stored native products for food, seeds, and other necessities. After the meeting, the company also signed a purchase contract with the people of Zhangyi District for 100,000 bamboo-sectioned Qianghuo roots. In order to purchase licorice from the disaster victims, the Zhangye Branch Company even sent people to X溝 to learn how to process licorice. In addition, trade companies throughout Gansu Province have also contacted fraternal companies or private merchants inside and outside the province to carry out purchasing work on their behalf. For example, the Qin'an Branch Company signed a contract with the Lanzhou City Company to purchase gunpowder on their behalf, and the Qingyang Branch Company purchased 100,000 jin of gourd seeds and perilla seeds for the Xi'an Paint Factory, which increased the income of the disaster victims considerably.

On the one hand, trade companies throughout Gansu Province are actively carrying out purchases; on the other hand, they are actively seeking sales channels for the purchased native products in order to expand re-purchases. Thanks to the vigorous development of the purchase and sale of native products by the trade company system in the province, it has played a significant role in ensuring the safe passage of disaster-stricken people in the province through the famine.

    甘肃省贸易公司系统
    积极购销灾区土特产
    甘肃省去冬少雪，今春少雨，个别地区灾情严重。该省各贸易公司和商店，为了支持灾区农民渡过灾荒，结合本地区具体情况，利用各种方式开展收购土特产业务。如武威分公司贸易组配合合作社，并组织了私商，到靖边区和张义区（都是重灾区）分别召开短距离物资交流会，成交二亿七千八百万元，其中土产成交占一亿一千二百万元，使灾民将所存土产换回了口粮、种籽和其他生活必需品。会后，该公司还与张义区群众签订了十万竹节羌活的收购合同。张掖支公司为了收购灾民的甘草，进行加工，还特地派人到新沟去学习甘草加工的方法。此外，甘肃省各地贸易公司还和省内外各兄弟公司或私商取得联系，进行代购工作。如秦安支公司与兰州市公司订立了代购火硝合同，庆阳分公司代西安油漆厂收购十万斤葫籽、荏籽，都使灾民增加了不少收入。
    甘肃省内各地贸易公司一方面积极进行收购，另一方面积极为收购来的土特产找寻销路，以进行扩大再收购。由于该省贸易公司系统大力开展土特产购销业务，对该省灾区灾民安全渡过灾荒起了重大作用。（方承杰）
