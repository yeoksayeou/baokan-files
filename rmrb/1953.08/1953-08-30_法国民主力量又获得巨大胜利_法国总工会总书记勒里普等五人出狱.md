Xinhua News Agency, August 28th dispatch from Paris: General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, Alain Le Léap, Editor-in-Chief of "l'Humanité," André Stil, Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor, Lycien Molino, leader of the Republican Youth of France, Guy Ducoloné, and André Laurent, walked out of Fresnes Prison on the evening of the 25th. This is another great victory for the democratic forces in France, following the release of the young peace fighter Henri Martin.

Le Léap, Ducoloné, and Laurent were arrested in October of last year on the false charge of “endangering the external security of the state”; Stil and Molino were also arrested in March of this year on the same charge. After their arrest, the people of France, with the support of people all over the world, have resolutely demanded the release of these democratic leaders. In recent days, many striking workers have included the release of these democratic leaders in their demands, and have submitted petitions to the Paris Investigation Court. The pressure of this movement demanding release was so strong that the Paris Investigation Court finally had to announce the "temporary release" of Le Léap and Stil, etc., on the afternoon of the 25th.

The French people cheered for their victory. French Communist Party leaders Auguste Lecœur and Raymond Guyot, trade union leaders, and a group of Parisian working people went to Fresnes Prison to welcome the released democratic fighters and presented them with flowers.
Xinhua News Agency, August 28th dispatch from Vienna on the 27th via TASS: General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Louis Saillant, issued a statement on the release of General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, Vice President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Alain Le Léap, Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, Lycien Molino, and Editor-in-Chief of "l'Humanité," André Stil.

He said: This is a major international achievement for the working class. The protest movement in various countries has been of great help to the struggle of the French working people to release Le Léap. The news of Le Léap's release not only makes the working class rejoice, but also makes the general public and those democratic, progressive, and socialist elements who are shocked to see the continuous destruction of trade union rights and democratic freedoms rejoice.

Le Léap's release encourages the World Federation of Trade Unions to continue the struggle for trade union rights and democratic freedoms.

    法国民主力量又获得巨大胜利
    法国总工会总书记勒里普等五人出狱
    世界工联总书记赛扬就勒里普等获释发表声明
    【新华社二十八日讯】巴黎消息：法国总工会总书记阿兰·勒里普、“人道报”总编辑安德烈·斯梯、总工会书记吕希欧·摩林诺、法兰西共和青年联盟领袖居伊·杜科朗和安德烈·劳伦，在二十五日晚走出费雷纳监狱。这是继青年和平战士亨利·马丁出狱后，法国民主力量的又一次巨大胜利。
    勒里普、杜科朗和劳伦是被诬犯了所谓“危害国家外部安全”罪，在去年十月被捕的；斯梯和摩林诺也以同样罪名，在今年三月被捕。他们被捕后，法国全国人民在全世界人民支持下，一直坚决要求释放这些民主领袖。最近几天来，许多罢工的工人把释放这些民主领袖列入他们的要求，纷纷向巴黎侦察庭提出要求书。这个要求释放的运动压力是如此强大，以至巴黎侦察庭终于不得不在二十五日下午宣布“暂时释放”勒里普和斯梯等。
    法国人民为他们的胜利而欢呼。法国共产党领袖奥古斯特·勒戈尔和雷蒙·葛约、工会领袖和一群巴黎劳动人民到费雷纳监狱前欢迎出狱的民主战士，向他们献花。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十七日讯：世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬就法国总工会总书记、世界工联副主席阿兰·勒里普、法国总工会书记吕希欧·摩林诺和“人道报”总编辑安德烈·斯梯获释发表声明。
    他说：这是工人阶级所取得的具有重大国际意义的成就。世界各国的抗议运动对法国劳动人民争取释放勒里普的斗争，有巨大帮助。勒里普获释的消息不但使工人阶级欢欣鼓舞，而且使一般人民以及那些眼看工会权利与民主自由连续受到摧残而感到震惊的民主、进步和社会主义分子欢欣鼓舞。
    勒里普的获释，鼓舞着世界工会联合会去继续争取工会权利和民主自由的斗争。
