    Steadily Develop Rural Credit Cooperative Undertakings

    Along with the recovery and development of agricultural production and the advancement of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, rural credit cooperative undertakings in various parts of the country have also developed to a certain extent. Currently, there are 27,433 credit cooperative organizations nationwide, including 5,559 credit cooperatives, 19,231 credit mutual aid groups, and 2,643 credit departments of supply and marketing cooperatives. The development of rural credit cooperative business has played a positive role in supporting production, activating rural finance, restricting usury, and promoting agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, as well as the development of supply and marketing businesses.

    The current development of credit cooperative organizations is far from meeting the needs of rural economic development. This is because in the vast old liberated areas, mutual aid production cooperation has become widespread, and production technology has been improved, urgently requiring a large increase in production funds; in the newly liberated areas, the peasants who have been emancipated still lack means of production and face many difficulties in their lives; the loans from state-owned banks cannot meet the needs of the peasants; and in some areas, usurious exploitation is either beginning to grow or has become an important factor in the new class differentiation. All this illustrates the important significance of developing credit cooperative organizations.

    However, in the work of developing credit mutual aid and cooperation, some areas, without considering the actual rural situation and the principle of voluntary participation by the peasants, have adopted impatient and rash approaches, which is very dangerous. Some areas blindly pursue quantity. For example, in Zhongbu Street, Leping County, Jiangxi Province, an area organized seventeen credit cooperatives within two or three months through administrative mobilization. Some areas blindly pursue large-scale credit cooperative organizations. For example, the Zhanglin Credit Cooperative in Zhenping County, Henan Province, included eight townships. Some cooperatives used compulsory means to collect shares, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Some credit cooperatives have made mistakes in their lending policies. For example, some credit cooperatives, because commercial loans are "short-term, high-interest, and quick to repay," have abandoned their members and engaged in commercial lending. Some credit cooperatives only lend to poor peasants and not to middle peasants; some credit cooperatives only lend to organized peasants and not to or lend less to individual peasants. These situations indicate that the current development of rural credit cooperative undertakings must implement a steady development policy.

    The so-called steady development means carefully studying the local economic situation, the level of awareness of the masses, and the conditions of the cadres, and establishing credit cooperative organizations in a guided and step-by-step manner based on the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, and based on the needs and possible conditions. In areas where credit cooperative organizations have no foundation, credit mutual aid groups should be organized under leadership. The organization of credit mutual aid groups is simple (with a leader and deputy leader, and simple agreements), which is very suitable for the habits of peasants. There are two forms of this kind of credit mutual aid group: one does not handle deposit business, and the leader is responsible for the registration, introduction, and guarantee responsibilities of borrowing and lending among members; the other handles deposit and loan business and has a certain amount of shares, partially possessing the rudiments of a credit cooperative. In these areas, credit cooperatives should also be established on a trial basis with emphasis, in order to set an example and guide credit groups to develop into advanced credit cooperatives. In areas where credit mutual aid groups have a foundation, credit mutual aid groups should be gradually helped to develop into credit cooperatives. The credit departments of existing supply and marketing cooperatives should be helped to develop into independent credit cooperatives.

    The lending work of all credit cooperative organizations must be combined with production and serve the members. Only by actively supporting production can the strength of credit organizations be continuously expanded. After the establishment of the Baichi and Huangshan Credit Cooperatives in Huguan County, Shanxi Province, they supported the masses in purchasing 428 head of livestock, 178 sheep, 120,000 catties of fertilizer, more than 2,000 pieces of agricultural implements, and supported 177 iron furnaces. The masses called it "a small bank that solves production difficulties" and signed up to join the cooperative one after another. More than 95% of the total number of households in the business areas of these two cooperatives have joined the credit cooperative. Credit cooperative organizations should grasp the lending work according to the size of the difficulties and the urgency of the needs of the members. Some credit cooperative organizations mechanically advocate "collective first, then individual," "production first, then life," and "focus on joint loans and joint use," which is very incomplete. It is correct to attach importance to supporting mutual aid and cooperation organizations, but the care for the production and life of individual members should never be ignored. Because the rights and obligations of credit cooperative members are equal, if priority is given based on "collective" or "individual," it violates the principle of equality and will cause mutual aid organizations to become detached from individual peasants. The production and life of peasants are inseparable, and life difficulties often affect production and force peasants to borrow at usurious rates. Therefore, credit cooperative organizations should solve the difficulties of members according to the actual situation; if members do have difficulties in their lives, they should be helped to solve them.

    Credit cooperative organizations should selectively and conditionally try to sign "business contracts" with agricultural production cooperatives (or mutual aid groups) and supply and marketing cooperatives. These "business contracts" should be signed on the basis of voluntary participation and mutual benefit by all parties. The content of the contract should be simple and specific, and the time should not be too long. The support of credit cooperatives for supply and marketing cooperatives should be carried out under the condition that members need fewer loans and more deposits, so as not to affect the lending activities of credit cooperatives. The "business contact contract" and "three-link contract" created by Dongquan and other credit cooperatives in Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, are better. The "business contact contract" stipulates that production mutual aid groups (cooperatives) deposit funds in credit cooperative organizations, and credit cooperative organizations provide assistance when there are difficulties. The "three-link contract" stipulates that credit cooperative organizations support supply and marketing cooperatives with funds, supply and marketing cooperatives supply mutual aid groups with production or living materials, and mutual aid groups deposit money and grain in credit cooperatives. This method is very popular among members.

    Credit cooperative organizations should mainly focus on receiving and releasing currency. However, since peasants mostly sell agricultural products to purchase production and living goods, it is difficult to mobilize peasants to deposit all their currency. When necessary, credit cooperatives should still store a portion of physical objects. However, the types of physical objects stored should not be too many, and the possible backlog, price difference, compensation, and difficulties in storage technology should be carefully considered. It is best to adopt the "determine deposits based on loans" method (how much grain the masses need to borrow is how much grain they deposit).

    The state-owned banks should lead and support credit cooperative organizations in terms of financial policies and business operations, which is an important condition for the development and consolidation of credit cooperative organizations. Since rural deposit and loan business is seasonal, it is difficult for credit cooperatives to balance their deposit and loan business. Therefore, banks need to help credit cooperatives to flexibly circulate funds. When a credit cooperative is newly established and absorbs few deposits or lacks funds, the bank should provide loans; when the funds of the credit cooperative are accumulated, they should be transferred to the bank for deposit.

    It should be recognized that the development of credit cooperative organizations does not mean prohibiting free lending in rural areas. Free lending still has a positive role in regulating funds in today's rural areas. However, the scope of free lending is small and has spontaneity and blindness, which can easily lead to usurious exploitation. We cannot adopt a simple restriction or complete laissez-faire attitude towards free lending, but should correctly implement the policy of "voluntary lending and borrowing, repayment of borrowing, principal and interest, and low-interest lending" to facilitate the development of free lending; on the other hand, we must actively and steadily develop credit cooperative organizations to strengthen the leadership of free lending. Only by organizing credit mutual aid and cooperation can we widely organize idle rural funds into production in a guided and planned manner, help peasants solve difficulties, and restrict the development of usury.

### 稳步开展农村信用合作事业

    稳步开展农村信用合作事业
    随着农业生产的恢复和发展以及互助合作运动的开展，全国各地农村信用合作事业也有了一定的发展。现全国的信用合作组织已有二万七千四百三十三个单位，包括五千五百五十九个信用合作社，一万九千二百三十一个信用互助组，二千六百四十三个供销社的信用部。农村信用合作业务的开展，对扶植生产、活跃农村金融、限制高利贷、推动农业互助合作及供销业务的发展都起了积极的作用。
    目前信用合作组织的发展，还远远赶不上农村经济发展的需要。这是因为广大的老解放区的互助生产合作有了普遍发展、生产技术得到改良，急需增加大量的生产资金；新解放区的翻身农民还缺乏生产资料，生活上也有很多困难；国家银行的贷款还不能满足农民的需要；有些地区的高利贷剥削或者正在开始滋长，或者已成为新的阶级分化的重要因素。凡此一切，都说明了发展信用合作组织的重要意义。
    但是在发展信用互助合作的工作上，若干地区不根据农村实际情况和农民自愿原则，采取了急躁冒进的作法，这是非常危险的。有些地区盲目追求数量，江西省乐平县众埠街一个区竟用行政号召的办法，在两三个月内组织了十七个信用合作社。有些地区盲目追求大型信用合作组织，河南镇平县的张林信用合作社，竟包括八个乡的范围。有些合作社在收集股金时实行强迫命令的办法，引起群众的不满。有些信用社在贷款政策上犯了一些错误。例如：有的信用合作社由于商业放款“短期、利高、还的快”，竟丢掉社员，进行商业放款。有些信用社只贷款给贫农，不贷给中农；有的信用社只贷款给组织起来的农民，不贷给或少贷给单干农民。这些情况说明，现在发展农村信用合作事业，必须实行稳步发展的方针。
    所谓稳步发展，就是认真研究当地经济情况、群众觉悟程度和干部条件，根据群众自愿和互利的原则，根据需要和可能的条件，有领导地有步骤地建立信用合作组织。在信用合作组织尚无基础的地区，应该有领导地组织信用互助组。信用互助组的组织简单（有正副组长、有简单公约），很适合农民的习惯。这种信用互助组的组织形式有两种：一是不经办存款业务，组长负责组员之间借贷的登记、介绍、保证责任；二是办理存放款业务，并有一定的股金，部分具备信用社的雏形。在这类地区，还应该有重点地试办信用合作社，以便树立榜样，引导信用组向高级的信用社发展。在信用互助组有了基础的地区，应该逐步帮助信用互助组提高为信用合作社。对现有供销合作社的信用部，应帮助其向独立的信用合作社发展。
    一切信用合作组织的放款工作，必须结合生产，为社员服务。只有积极扶植生产，才能不断地扩大信用组织的力量。山西省壶关县百尺、黄山两信用社建立以后，支持群众购买牲畜四百二十八头，羊一百七十八只，肥料十二万斤，农具二千余件，扶植铁货炉一百七十七座。群众称它是“解决生产困难的小银行”，纷纷报名入社。这两个社业务区域内的总户数，已有百分之九十五以上参加了信用社。信用合作组织应根据社员困难的大小、需要的缓急掌握放款工作。有些信用合作组织机械地提“先集体、后个体”，“先生产、后生活”，“着重伙贷伙用”，这是很不全面的。重视对互助合作组织的扶植，这是正确的，但决不应忽视对个体社员的生产及生活的照顾。因为信用合作社社员的权利、义务是平等的，若按“集体”或“个体”划出先后，就违反了平等的原则，会使互助组织脱离个体农民。农民的生产与生活是分不开的，生活困难往往会影响生产，会迫使农民去借高利贷，因此，信用合作组织应该根据实际情况，解决社员的困难；如社员生活确有困难，就应该帮助他解决生活困难。
    信用合作组织应该有重点地、有条件地与农业生产合作社（或互助组）和供销合作社试行订立“业务合同”。这种“业务合同”应在各方自愿互利的基础上订立。合同内容要简单、具体，时间不宜过长。信用合作社对供销合作社的支持，应在社员需要贷款少、存款多而不致影响信用社贷放活动的条件下进行。山西平遥县东泉等信用社创造的“业务联系合同”、“三连环合同”的办法比较好。“业务联系合同”规定：生产互助组（社）有款存入信用合作组织，有困难时由信用合作组织给以扶助。“三连环合同”规定：信用合作组织支持供销社资金，供销社供应互助组生产或生活资料，互助组向信用社存款存粮，这种办法深得社员欢迎。
    信用合作组织应以收放货币为主。但农民出卖农产品，大都为购买生产和生活用品，因此，动员农民全部存储货币是有困难的，必要时信用社仍应存储一部分实物。但存储实物的种类不宜过多，并应周密考虑存储实物可能发生的积压、差价、赔累、和保管技术上的困难，最好采用“以贷定存”办法（群众需要贷粮多少，即存粮多少）。
    国家银行应在金融政策及业务经营上领导与支持信用合作组织，这是发展和巩固信用合作组织的重要条件。由于农村存放业务有季节性，信用社的存放业务很难平衡，因此，银行需要在资金方面帮助信用社灵活周转。当信用社初成立吸收存款尚少或缺乏资金时，银行要给予贷款；信用社的资金积存时就应转存银行。
    应该认识：发展信用合作组织并不意味着禁止农村中的自由借贷。自由借贷在今天的农村中还具有调剂资金的积极作用。但自由借贷的范围小，且带有自发性与盲目性，易于走向高利剥削。我们对待自由借贷不能采取简单的限制或者完全放任的态度，而应该一方面正确贯彻“借贷自愿，有借有还，有本有利，低利借贷”的政策，以利自由借贷的开展；另一方面又必须积极地、稳步地发展信用合作组织，以加强对自由借贷的领导。只有组织信用互助合作，才能有领导、有计划地广泛组织农村闲散资金投入生产，帮助农民解决困难，限制高利贷的发展。
