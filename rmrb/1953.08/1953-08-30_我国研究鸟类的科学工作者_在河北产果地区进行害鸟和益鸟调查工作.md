    Chinese scientists studying birds from the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, are conducting an investigation of harmful and beneficial birds in fruit-producing areas of Hebei. They will proceed from distinguishing between harmful and beneficial birds to study how to prevent and control harmful birds and protect and cultivate beneficial birds, to find ways to use beneficial birds to reduce fruit tree pests and improve fruit yield and quality. They have already made many new discoveries in their work.
    At the beginning of April this year, the survey team, composed of scientists, set off from Beijing to Changli County, the fruit production center of Hebei Province. At that time, tender green buds had just appeared on the fruit trees. They got up early every morning and carried shotguns, binoculars, and collection bags to work in the orchards on the mountains and below. Local farmers told them about the activities of various birds in the fields, and the farmers' children helped them catch birds. In less than three months, they have collected nearly a thousand specimens of more than 120 species of birds. After catching various birds, they recorded their weight, body length, etc., registered them, skinned them into specimens, and took out the bird's stomach to analyze the food inside, so as to determine the benefits or harms of this bird to fruit trees at a certain period, or even throughout the entire period. They have already made many preliminary findings. For example, the common red-billed crow in this area, which looks and is colored very similarly to crows, is generally considered a harmful bird. However, after conducting preliminary bird stomach analysis, they found that although it eats some sorghum, peanuts, cypress seeds, etc., its main food is insects harmful to fruit trees. Therefore, it can be said that in April and May, this red-billed crow is more beneficial than harmful.
    In China's vast land, as far as is now known, there are nearly 2,000 species and subspecies of birds living. In the past, scientists' research on these birds was limited to the scope of pure taxonomy. After liberation, scientific workers recognized the importance of science serving production and the integration of theory with practice, and bird research is also moving towards a production-oriented path. This purposeful and systematic bird survey is only a beginning. The Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences plans to gain experience and effectiveness in one area, and then extend the survey to vast areas of the country. (Xinhua News Agency)

    我国研究鸟类的科学工作者
    在河北产果地区进行害鸟和益鸟调查工作
    中国科学院动物研究室研究鸟类的科学家们正在河北产果地区进行害鸟和益鸟的调查研究工作。他们将从区别害鸟和益鸟的工作中进而研究如何防治害鸟、护殖益鸟，以便找出利用益鸟来减少果树虫害以提高水果产量和品质的途径。他们在工作中已有许多新的发现。
    今年四月初，这个由科学工作者组成的调查队由北京出发到河北省产果中心昌黎县。那时果树上刚出现嫩绿的幼芽。他们每天清晨起就背着猎枪、望远镜、采集袋等到山上山下的果园里去工作。当地农民们告诉他们各种禽鸟在田圃间活动的情况，农家的孩子们并帮助他们捕捉禽鸟。在不到三个月的时间里，他们已采集了将近千号、分隶一百二十多种的鸟类。他们捉到各种禽鸟以后，记录了它们的体重、身长等，经过登记，把它们剥制成标本，并拿出鸟胃分析胃里的食物，从而决定这种鸟在某一时期，甚至全时期，对于果树的益处或害处。他们已有许多初步的发现。例如该地常见的红嘴乌鸦，外形和色彩很像乌鸦，一般人都认为它是害鸟，在进行初步的鸟胃分析后，他们发现它虽然吃一部分高粱、花生、柏树种子等，但它的主要食物是有害果树的昆虫，因此可以说，在四五月里，这种红嘴乌鸦是益多于害的。
    在我国辽阔的土地上，就现在所知，生活着近二千种和亚种的禽鸟。对这些鸟类的研究，过去科学家们都限于单纯的分类学范围。解放后，科学工作者认清了科学为生产服务和理论联系实际的重要性，鸟类研究的工作也正朝着面向生产的道路前进。有目的、有系统的鸟类调查工作，这次仅是一个开端。中国科学院动物研究室准备在一个地区取得经验和效果后，再把调查工作推广到全国广大地区去。（新华社）
