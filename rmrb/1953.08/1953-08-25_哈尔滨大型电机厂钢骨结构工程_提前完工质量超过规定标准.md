    Steel Structure Project of Harbin Large Electric Machine Factory
    Completed Ahead of Schedule with Quality Exceeding Standards
    The steel structure project of the Harbin Large Electric Machine Factory, undertaken by the Riveting and Welding Plant of the Central Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration, was completed on August 12, twenty-seven days ahead of schedule. The quality of the entire project reached 99.6 percent, significantly exceeding the quality standards stipulated by the state.
    The steel structure of the large electric machine factory is vast and complex, requiring more than 3,100 tons of steel. In the process of splicing steel columns and beams, more than 1.6 million holes need to be drilled, over 600,000 rivets applied, and 23,000 meters of steel welded. Quality requirements are extremely strict. This was the first time the Riveting and Welding Plant had undertaken such a large project, and its equipment, technical capabilities, and management experience were insufficient. To ensure the completion of the project, the plant took a series of proactive measures. Before construction, the plant first conducted education on national industrialization and key project construction among its employees, and organized workers to study around the project tasks, so that cadres and workers had a clear understanding. To ensure project quality, the plant strengthened its inspection mechanisms before construction began; in the early stages of construction, a major inspection of the pre-installation quality of the steel structure project was conducted on the site, assembling and installing various processed "station columns," "gables," and "roof trusses" to inspect quality problems, identify causes, and study prevention methods, which had a great educational effect on cadres and workers. During the responsibility system movement, various systems to guarantee quality were established, and exemplary groups were cultivated to promote advanced experiences, which guaranteed project quality and progress.
    The successful completion of the steel structure project of the large electric machine factory is inseparable from the constant care of the local Party committee and government, as well as the close cooperation between the client and the contractor. For example, during construction, shortages of rivets, changes in plans, and rain caused the project to be at risk of delaying the schedule. The Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly convened meetings to assist both parties in solving difficulties. To ensure the schedule, the Riveting and Welding Plant mobilized its employees to tap potential and formulated measures and plans to guarantee completion on schedule; at the same time, it mobilized workers in the mechanical workshop to help the client manufacture a batch of rivets, solving the problem of rivet shortages.
    The plant is now summarizing the construction experience of this project to further improve its technical and management level to meet new project tasks. (Zheng Weiming, Xu Shaoqing)

    哈尔滨大型电机厂钢骨结构工程
    提前完工质量超过规定标准
    中央有色金属工业管理局铆焊厂承建的哈尔滨大型电机厂钢骨结构工程，已于八月十二日较计划工作日提前二十七天竣工。全部工程质量达到百分之九十九点六，大大超过国家规定的质量指标。
    大型电机厂钢骨结构庞大复杂，需用钢材三千一百多吨。在钢柱、钢梁的拼镶过程中，要钻眼一百六十多万个，铆钉六十余万个，电焊钢材二万三千多公尺。质量要求非常严格。铆焊厂第一次承建这样大的工程，设备和技术力量以及管理经验都很不足。为保证完成工程任务，该厂曾采取了一系列的积极措施。施工之前，该厂首先在职工中进行了国家工业化及重点工程建设的教育，并围绕着工程任务，组织职工学习，使干部和工人心中都有了底。为保证工程质量，该厂在开工前充实了检查机构；开工初期在工地里进行了钢骨工程预安装质量大检查，将已加工的各种不同形的“站柱”、“山花”、“屋架”等各拼起一架，进行安装试验，检查质量毛病，找出原因，研究出防止的办法，这对干部和工人的教育作用都很大。在责任制运动中，又建立了各种保证质量的制度，并培养了典型小组，推广先进经验，对工程质量与工程进度起了保证作用。
    大型电机厂钢骨结构工程的顺利完成，是与地方党委和政府的经常关怀以及甲乙双方密切合作分不开的。如在施工中曾因铆钉供应不足，计划变更以及下雨等原因，使工程有拖延工期的危险。中共哈尔滨市委员会及时召开会议，协助甲乙双方解决困难。铆焊厂为了保证工期，发动职工挖掘潜力，制订了保证按期完工的措施计划；同时动员机械车间工人帮助甲方制造一批铆钉，解决了铆钉不足的困难。
    现在该厂正总结这一工程的施工经验，进一步提高技术与管理水平，以迎接新的工程任务。     （郑维铭、徐少青）
