Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, July 31st. Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: It is now very clear what Dulles' trip to South Korea will bring to the future of peace in Korea.

    After Dulles announced his intention to go to South Korea and used utterly rogue-like language to slander the Chinese and Korean side, Dulles also publicly set deadlines and conditions for the political conference, claiming that the United States agreed that if the political conference had not reached an agreement after ninety days, the United States would withdraw from the conference together with Syngman Rhee. Thus, Syngman Rhee obviously received new encouragement from his "best friend and sympathizer." He immediately clamored even more arrogantly that he would "unify Korea." According to "New York Times" reporter James Reston, Syngman Rhee was very pleased that Dulles was going to South Korea. Reston said that Syngman Rhee "made it clear to him that he considers the armistice a 'temporary' expedient, the purpose of which is to achieve the sole objective - to get the Communists to agree to the entire Korea being ruled by his regime." Syngman Rhee said that he tolerated the armistice agreement because he believed that if the political conference failed, the United States would support him in resuming the war. He said that if the political conference could not enable him to "unify Korea," and the United States did not resume the war, that would be "unthinkable." At the same time, International News Service reporter Marvin Stone reported that senior officials of the Syngman Rhee clique in Seoul revealed that the United States had promised to consider resuming the war after the failure of the political conference.

    Syngman Rhee's clamor is undoubtedly exactly what Dulles needs. Washington is brewing a conspiracy to dress up its running dog as an untamable beast to be used as a tool for intimidation and blackmail by the United States. Dulles, regarding Syngman Rhee, whom he personally promoted, is pretending to be difficult to control. He pretends to be humble, as if nothing can be done without Syngman Rhee's nod. Dulles has stated that he and Syngman Rhee will decide the policies of the United Nations side at the future political conference. Not only that, but even which "allied countries" can participate in the political conference will be decided by him and Syngman Rhee. According to Turkish Ambassador to the United States, Erkin, after visiting Dulles, the issue of who will participate in the political conference will also be decided after the meeting between Dulles and Syngman Rhee. Dulles has assigned Syngman Rhee such a role, that is, to serve as a tool for the United States to force its "allies" to follow the United States in implementing its hegemonic policies.

    In contrast to pretending to be difficult to control with Syngman Rhee, Washington is now trying its best to rope in its "allies." According to Agence France-Presse, the United States is asking all countries with troops participating in the United Nations forces to issue a statement, in which they make such a guarantee, namely: if the Chinese and Korean side launch so-called "aggression," they will "take steps" to restore peace. This is actually to continue to tie these countries to the United States' chariot and to have them share the serious consequences if the political conference is sabotaged by the United States.

### 杜勒斯公然要给政治会议规定限期和条件  李承晚在美国纵容下又叫嚣要“统一朝鲜”

    杜勒斯公然要给政治会议规定限期和条件
    李承晚在美国纵容下又叫嚣要“统一朝鲜”
    【新华社开城三十一日电】本社特派记者江南报道：现在已经可以看得很清楚，杜勒斯的南朝鲜之行，将给朝鲜和平的前途带来些什么。
    在杜勒斯宣布要到南朝鲜去，并且用十足的流氓腔调大肆污蔑朝中方面之后，杜勒斯还公然给政治会议规定限期和条件，声称美国同意如果经过九十天之后，政治会议还没有达成协议，美国就要和李承晚一起退出会议。这样，李承晚显然从他这位“最好的朋友和同情者”那里得到了新的鼓励。他立刻更加嚣张地叫嚷要由他来“统一朝鲜”。据“纽约时报”记者詹姆斯·赖斯顿报道，李承晚对于杜勒斯要到南朝鲜去很是高兴。赖斯顿说，李承晚向他“明确表示，他认为停战是一种‘暂时’的权宜之计，目的在于达到唯一的目的——要共产党同意整个朝鲜由他的政权来统治”。李承晚说，他之所以容忍停战协定，是因为他相信如果政治会议失败，美国会支持他恢复战争。他说，如果政治会议不能使他“统一朝鲜”，而美国竟不恢复战争，那是“不可想像”的事。同时，国际新闻社记者马文·斯通报道说，汉城李承晚集团的高级官员透露，美国已经答应在政治会议失败后考虑恢复战争的问题。
    李承晚的这种叫嚷，无疑正是杜勒斯所需要的。华盛顿方面正酝酿一个阴谋，就是把它的这只走狗打扮成一个不可驯服的猛兽，作为美国进行恫吓和讹诈的工具。杜勒斯对于由他一手提携起来的李承晚，正装作很难驾驭的样子。他装作低声下气，似乎什么事情都得李承晚点头，否则就行不通。杜勒斯已表示过，要由他和李承晚来决定联合国方面在将来的政治会议上的政策。不但如此，甚至将来哪些“盟国”可以参加政治会议，也要由他和李承晚来决定。据土耳其驻美大使欧金在访问杜勒斯以后透露，关于由谁来参加政治会议的问题，也将在杜勒斯和李承晚会谈以后才能决定。杜勒斯已分配李承晚担任这样角色，就是作为美国强制其“盟国”来跟随美国推行其专横政策的工具。
    和对李承晚装出难于驾驭的样子相反，华盛顿方面现在正尽力设法套住它的“盟国”。据法新社报道说，美国正在要有军队参加联合国军的各国发表一个声明，在声明中提出这样的保证，即：如果朝中方面发动所谓“侵略”，它们就要“采取步骤”来恢复和平。这实际上就是要把这些国家继续缚在美国的战车上，要它们来分担政治会议如果被美国破坏之后的严重后果。
