    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th: On August 10th, the Korean-Chinese side repatriated 200 non-Korean prisoners of war and 188 Korean prisoners of war to the other side, including 138 wounded and sick prisoners of war, totaling 388. Among the non-Korean prisoners of war, there were 125 Americans, 50 Britons, and 25 Turks. The other side repatriated 2,065 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to our side, including 266 wounded and sick personnel, and 691 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, including 91 wounded and sick personnel.
    Today, within the prisoner of war repatriation exchange zone of the other side, an inhumane incident occurred where special agents disguised as South Korean civilians injured our captured personnel. At 8:45 AM, when the first batch of our repatriated captured personnel was traveling by vehicle from the other side's exchange zone towards our side's exchange zone, and had not yet left the other side's exchange zone, special agents disguised as South Korean civilians suddenly threw stones at our captured personnel, injuring three of our captured personnel. Our side's member of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee has protested to the other side regarding this incident, demanding that the other side promptly take necessary measures to prevent the continuation of such incidents, so as not to affect the progress of the prisoner of war repatriation work.

    朝中方面和对方八月十日继续遣返战俘
    我方抗议对方化装的特务打伤我被俘人员
    【新华社开城十日电】八月十日，朝中方面遣送给对方非朝鲜籍战俘二百名，朝鲜籍战俘一百八十八名，其中包括伤病战俘一百三十八名，共三百八十八名。在非朝鲜籍战俘中，包括美国籍一百二十五人，英国籍五十人，土耳其籍二十五人。对方遣送给我方朝鲜人民军被俘人员二千零六十五名，其中包括伤病人员二百六十六名，中国人民志愿军被俘人员六百九十一名，其中包括伤病人员九十一名。
    今天，在对方战俘遣返交接区内，发生了化装为南朝鲜平民的特务伤害我方被俘人员的非人道事件。上午八时四十五分，当首批遣返的我方被俘人员乘车自对方交接区向我方交接区驶来，而尚未驶出对方交接区范围时，突然有化装为南朝鲜平民的特务，向我方被俘人员投掷石块，打伤我方被俘人员三名。战俘遣返委员会我方委员已就这一事件向对方提出抗议，要求对方迅速采取必要措施，防止此类事件的继续发生，以免影响战俘遣返工作的进行。
