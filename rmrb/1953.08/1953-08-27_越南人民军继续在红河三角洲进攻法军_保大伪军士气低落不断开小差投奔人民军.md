Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: According to Vietnam News Agency, during the rainy season, the Vietnamese People's Army continues to attack French strongholds in the Red River Delta, inflicting over 500 casualties on the French troops.

    On August 1st, the People's Army attacked the French command posts in Dong Phu and Du She, Nam Dinh Province, killing or wounding 100 enemy soldiers, mostly European and African soldiers, including one colonel and two majors. The next day, the People's Army launched a surprise attack on the Van Dinh stronghold south of Hanoi, wiping out one enemy company and destroying six vehicles.

    The People's Army local forces in various provinces are also very active. The People's Army local forces in Guang'an Province recently ambushed an enemy company in Zhi Ling County, killing or wounding 87 enemy soldiers, two-thirds of whom were European and African officers and soldiers. The People's Army local forces in Xing'an Province killed and captured 65 enemy soldiers in the destruction of a French stronghold, seizing five cannons, 18 machine guns, and 70 rifles. In Henan, the militia killed or wounded 240 enemy soldiers in one month up to July 25th.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: According to Vietnam News Agency on August 24th: The demoralized Bao Dai puppet troops are constantly deserting in large numbers, defecting to the People's Army, or refusing to fight. In May and June this year, a total of 1,500 puppet troops deserted from the ranks in the left bank area of the Red River. In July, 30 newly formed puppet troops in Nam Dinh Province defected to the People's Army in two days. Two hundred puppet troops stationed in Hoi An City, Guang Nam Province, Central Vietnam, refused to participate in "mopping-up operations."

    The correct land policy implemented by the Vietnamese government has a tremendous impact on the puppet troops. After hearing the land decree announced by the people's regime, the families of puppet troops in various parts of Bac Ninh Province went to the front of the enemy strongholds to hold demonstrations, demanding the release of their husbands or sons to return home and divide the land. The struggle of puppet troops refusing to fight and demanding demobilization is also expanding. In the Chongqing stronghold of Ninh Binh Province, 29 puppet troops successfully struggled to leave the puppet army and return to their hometowns.

Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: The "mobilization orders" of the French colonialists and the Bao Dai puppet regime have been resisted by the people in enemy-occupied cities. According to Vietnam News Agency: In early July this year, the French colonialists arrested nearly 1,000 young people in Hanoi and locked them in a school, preparing to send them to puppet army training camps. On July 3rd, the families of the arrested young people stormed the school and were beaten by the enemy. At this time, the imprisoned youth were stirred up and shouted slogans such as "Down with the mobilization order!" "Down with the puppets and traitors!" The enemy quickly dispatched a large number of soldiers and police to suppress the angry masses. A large number of arrested youths took advantage of the chaos to escape from the school. On the night of July 7th, another group of arrested young people took advantage of the enemy showing a movie and jumped over the barbed wire fence to escape. The enemy troops opened fire, but the masses outside retaliated with stones. This time, more than 100 young people escaped.

    越南人民军继续在红河三角洲进攻法军
    保大伪军士气低落不断开小差投奔人民军
    【新华社二十五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军继续在雨季期中在红河三角洲进攻法军的据点，杀伤法军五百多人。
    八月一日，人民军进攻南定省东府和杜社的法军指挥部，杀伤大部是欧、非籍士兵的敌军一百人，其中有一个上校和两个少校军官。第二天，人民军向河内以南的文定据点发动了一次突袭，杀伤敌军一个连，击毁汽车六辆。
    各省的人民军地方部队也很活跃。广安省的人民军地方部队最近在芷灵县截击了敌军一个连，杀伤敌军八十七人，三分之二是欧、非籍的官兵。兴安省的人民军地方部队在摧毁法军的一处据点中打死和俘掳敌军六十五人，缴获炮五门、机枪十八挺和步枪七十支。河南的民兵在到七月二十五日止的一个月中，共打死打伤敌军二百四十人。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据越南通讯社二十四日讯：士气低落的保大伪军不断地大批开小差、投奔人民军或拒绝作战。今年五、六月份，红河左岸地区共有伪军一千五百名离开队伍。七月间，南定省新编成的伪军营在两天当中就有三十人投向人民军。驻扎在中越广南省会安城的伪军二百人拒绝参加“扫荡”。
    越南政府实行的正确土地政策对伪军起着巨大影响。北宁省各地的伪军家属在听到人民政权宣布的土地法令后，纷纷跑到敌人的据点面前举行示威，要求释放她们的丈夫或儿子回家分地。伪军拒绝作战、要求复员的斗争也日益扩展，宁平省的重庆据点就有伪军二十九人斗争胜利，离开伪军回到家乡去。
    【新华社二十六日讯】法国殖民者和保大傀儡政权的“动员令”在敌占城市中遭到人民的抵制。据越南通讯社消息：今年七月初，法国殖民者在河内逮捕了近一千名青年，把他们关在一个学校里，准备送往伪军训练营。七月三日，被逮捕的青年的家属冲进学校，遭到敌人的毒打。这时，被囚禁的青年轰动起来，高呼“打倒动员令！”“打倒傀儡和卖国贼！”等口号。敌人连忙调来大批军警对愤怒的群众进行镇压。大批被捕的青年趁着混乱逃出学校。七月七日夜，又有一批被捕的青年趁着敌人放映电影的时候，跳过铁丝网逃走。敌军开枪射击，但外面的群众就用石头回击他们。这一次，逃跑的青年共有一百多人。
