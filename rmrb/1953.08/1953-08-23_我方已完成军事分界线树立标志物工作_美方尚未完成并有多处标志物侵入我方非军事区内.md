Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 21st: The Korean-Chinese side has completed all the work of erecting markers for the military demarcation line on the 17th. However, since the US side has not completed many sections, the Joint Observer Teams have not been able to begin general inspection work.

As of the 20th, the US side had erected markers for Joint Observer Teams Six and Seven. Team Three had only completed about one-quarter, Team Four only about one-half, Team Five had completed the erection of markers, but the safety passages had not been cleared and marked. Team Eight had not completed the work, and when the Korean-Chinese side inquired about the completion status of Teams Nine and Ten from the US side, the US side replied that it had not yet received a report. At the Secretary-General's meeting on the 21st, our Secretary-General urged the US side to accelerate the process and complete the marking work as soon as possible.

After the Joint Observer Teams Six and Seven completed the erection of markers for the military demarcation line, the supervisory officers and marking team leaders from both sides completed a preliminary inspection on the 20th. The inspection revealed that eleven markers erected by the US side had intruded into our side's demilitarized zone. In the section of the Sixth Joint Observer Team for which the US side was responsible, five markers were buried in our side's demilitarized zone; in the section of the Seventh Joint Observer Team for which the US side was responsible, six markers intruded into our side's demilitarized zone. The distance of intrusion ranged from ten meters to as much as three hundred meters.

Due to our side's extremely conscientious and responsible work in erecting the markers, no deviations were found during the inspection.

At the meeting of supervisory officers and marking team leaders of the two teams held on the 20th, our side, based on the common map issued by the Military Armistice Commission, requested the US side to make corrections.

    我方已完成军事分界线树立标志物工作
    美方尚未完成并有多处标志物侵入我方非军事区内
    【新华社开城二十一日电】军事分界线树立标志物的工作朝中方面已在十七日全部完成，但由于美方仍有许多地段尚未完成，以致联合观察小组还不能普遍开始检查工作。
    到二十日为止，美方除联合观察小组第六、第七组树立了标志物以外，第三组只完成了约四分之一，第四组才完成了二分之一左右，第五组标志物虽已树立完毕，但安全通道尚未扫清和标志出来，第八组亦未完成，第九、第十两组当朝中方面向美方询问完成情况时，美方答称，尚未接到报告。在二十一日的秘书长会议上，我方秘书长已敦促美方加速进行，早日完成标志工作。
    联合观察小组第六、第七两组于军事分界线标志物树立完毕后，双方监督军官与标志队长在二十日完成了初步检查，检查中发现美方树立的标志物有十一处侵入了我方非军事区内。在第六联合观察小组美方负责地段内，有五个标志物埋设在我方非军事区内；在第七联合观察小组美方负责地段内，有六个标志物侵入我方非军事区内。侵越的距离少的是十公尺，最多的达三百公尺。
    由于我方在树立标志物的工作中极其认真负责，检查时未发现有任何偏差。
    在二十日举行的该两小组双方监督军官和标志队长的会议上，我方已根据军事停战委员会发下的共同地图要求美方予以纠正。
