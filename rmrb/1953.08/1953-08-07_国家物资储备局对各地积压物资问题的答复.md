The State Materials Reserve Bureau of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government sent the following letter: The "Reader's Letters Digest" column of the People's Daily on May 16 published several letters from readers reflecting the problem of non-reserve materials overstocked in our bureau and its subordinate branches. The following is a report on the inspection and handling of the situation by our bureau:

    First, although the materials stored at the foot of the south wall of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing are dilapidated, they can still be used as raw materials for industrial production. Because the materials are bulky and cannot be stored in a warehouse, they are piled up in the Temple of Heaven. We have now contacted relevant production units and allocated most of them for utilization; the rest are being properly stored and we are looking for ways to dispose of them.

    Second, the situation regarding the handling of the 500 kW turbine generator, a clearing material managed on behalf of the State-owned Yi-Luo Coal Mine by the Henan Provincial Reserve Office of our bureau (formerly the Henan Provincial Materials Bureau), is as follows: This generator was damaged before liberation and was handed over on-site to the former Henan Provincial Materials Bureau by the Yi-Luo Coal Mine in November 1951. On February 15, 1952, the Central and Southern Financial and Economic Committee approved the generator for the mine to retain for use, but the mine later decided it did not want it. Thus, for more than a year, this generator was not properly handled (after the National Materials Conference in 1952, it was changed to be handled by the Henan Provincial Reserve Office). The materials were stored outdoors for a long time, and poor storage caused undue losses. The Henan Provincial Reserve Office has conducted a thorough review and is determined to learn from this lesson, improve its work, and prevent similar incidents from happening.

    Third, among the dyestuffs in storage in East China, the amount stored in Qingdao by the Shandong Materials Administration is relatively large; some of them should be scrapped, and some are of very poor quality. Although the bureau has contacted relevant units many times and tried to find ways to utilize them, it has not yet found a sales target. The bureau has now decided to test these dyestuffs, and those that cannot be sold will be allocated to local governments free of charge for use by farmers.

    Fourth, it is a fact that some materials in the No. 1 Reserve Office of the Northeast Branch of our bureau have become moldy and deteriorated due to overstocking, causing losses to the state. Most of these materials were surrendered materials received in 1952 under the instructions of the former Northeast Finance Department, and were of poor quality and included waste products. Although the bureau had repeatedly proposed disposal methods and contacted relevant units, it ultimately did not achieve results due to insufficient determination, unclear disposal methods, and the fact that the materials did not meet the requirements of the user units. As a result, these materials were overstocked for a long time, and some have deteriorated and become ineffective. The current handling status of these materials is: all wool has been processed; copper buckles are being sold by the bureau's trust and commerce bank, but they are difficult to sell due to their poor quality; yellow military uniforms have been decided to be dyed and sold; and the local public security department is being contacted to find ways to utilize cotton military uniforms. The bureau is also looking for ways to dispose of other materials: military supplies are being requested to be handled by the Northeast Finance Committee in contact with the logistics department of the military region; general materials are being sold to state-owned commercial departments, cooperatives, or industrial and mining workers. If public units cannot sell or utilize them, they will be sold to private merchants.

### 国家物资储备局对各地积压物资问题的答复

    国家物资储备局对各地积压物资问题的答复
    中央人民政府政务院财经委员会国家物资储备局来信：五月十六日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了读者反映我局及所属分局积压非储备性物资的几封来信。兹将本局检查和处理情况复告如下：
    一，北京天坛南墙脚下所存物资虽已残破，但是还可用作工业生产的原料。因为物资体积庞大，无法入库，所以就堆在天坛。现在我们已和有关生产单位联系，调拨了大部分去利用；其余的除妥加保管外，正在设法处理。
    二，我局河南省储备处（即前河南省物资管理局）处理国营宜洛煤矿代管的清仓物资五百瓩透平发电机的情况如下：这部发电机在解放前已被破坏，一九五一年十一月由宜洛煤矿就地点交原河南省物资管理局。一九五二年二月十五日，中南财经委员会把发电机批给该矿留用，但该矿事后不要了。这样，一年多来，这部发电机未能妥为处理（一九五二年全国物资会议后即改为由河南省储备处代为处理）。而物资长期露天存放，保管不善，遭到不应有的损失。河南省储备处已经作了深刻检讨，并决心从中吸取教训，改进工作，防止类似事件发生。
    三，华东库存染料，以山东物资管理局青岛库存数较大；其中有的应该报废，有的质量很坏。这批染料，虽经多次和有关单位联系，力求设法利用，但迄今没有找到销售对象。该局现已决定把这批染料进行化验，凡无法销售的，就无价拨交地方政府发给农民利用。
    四，我局东北区分局第一储备处部分物资因积压而霉烂、变质，给国家造成损失，确系事实。这些物资大部是一九五二年原东北财政部指示接收的上交物资，质量低劣，且有废品。该局虽曾多次提出处理办法并和有关单位联系，但终因决心不够，处理办法不够明确，以及物资不合使用单位的要求始终没有结果。于是，这批物资就长期积压，部分已变质失效。现在这批物资的处理情况是：羊毛已全部处理完毕；铜扣子等正由该局信托商行出售，但由于质量太坏，很难销售；黄军衣决定染色后出卖；棉军服正与当地公安部门接洽设法利用。其他物资，该局也正在设法处理：凡军用物资请东北财委向军区后勤部联系处理；一般物资向国营商业部门、合作社或工矿职工销售。如公营单位不能销售或利用时，就卖给私商。
