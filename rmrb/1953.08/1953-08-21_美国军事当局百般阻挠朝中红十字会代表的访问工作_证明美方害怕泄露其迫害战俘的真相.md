Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th: Our special correspondent Wu Min reports: Due to the US military authorities' obstruction in every possible way, the work of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives visiting US-side prisoner-of-war camps in South Korea to provide humanitarian services to prisoners of war has virtually come to a standstill, with the Jeju Island group even being forced to return to Panmunjom from South Korea. Regarding the US military authorities' unreasonable behavior that violates the Armistice Agreement, the US Red Cross representatives participating in the Joint Red Cross Team have not only failed to make due representations to the US side in accordance with the Red Cross's traditional humanitarian spirit, but have also disregarded the facts to defend and cover up for them.

The fact is: The US side restricts the activities of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives in visiting prisoners of war everywhere. Whether in Jeju Island, Geoje Island, Busan, Munsan, the Imjin River Bridge, or Yeongdeungpo, the US side unreasonably restricts the time for the Korean-Chinese representatives to visit prisoners of war; on Geoje Island, the US side even only allowed the representatives to watch from a distance of about 100 meters away through barbed wire. In Yeongdeungpo, the US side limited the Korean-Chinese representatives to only three minutes of conversation with the prisoners of war. The US side also unreasonably prohibited the Korean representatives from delivering words of慰問(comfort) to the prisoners of war, and canceled the Korean-Chinese representatives' visits to the prisoners of war under various pretexts. However, US Red Cross representative Jenniwe said, "This is because the agreement stipulates that contact with prisoners of war, whether in North Korea or South Korea, cannot exceed four hours." This statement is completely unfounded. Neither the Armistice Agreement nor the Joint Red Cross Team's agreement stipulates a time limit for the Joint Red Cross Team's contact with prisoners of war. On the contrary, the Armistice Agreement stipulates that the commanders of each side should fully cooperate with the Joint Red Cross Team. In fact, the US side now simply does not allow the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives to contact the prisoners of war.

The fact is: The US side not only cannot guarantee the safety of the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives, but openly persecutes them. The Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives visiting Geoje Island were subjected to a gas attack for as long as an hour. The Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives at the Imjin River Bridge were even struck with a rifle by a US guard, Charles Herschcraft. Herschcraft admitted during the investigation that he was ordered to do so. However, when the Korean-Chinese representatives requested that the guard be punished, US Red Cross representative Cruz, who personally investigated the incident, said that the accusation was "unfounded," claiming that the bodily harm caused to the Korean-Chinese representatives by the guard was "invisible." According to this, American soldiers can continue to attack Korean-Chinese representatives, as long as the damage caused is "invisible."

The fact is: The interpreter provided by the US side to the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives cannot satisfactorily perform his task. The interpreter provided by the US side to the Korean-Chinese representatives visiting Jeju Island cannot speak Chinese, and this person cannot fully understand English. Therefore, it is virtually impossible for him to accurately convey the opinions of both sides. The Korean-Chinese representatives are fully justified in expressing dissatisfaction with this. However, US Red Cross representative Williams said that the Korean-Chinese representatives "stipulated their own set of translation rules," attempting to shift the responsibility back onto the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives.

The fact is: The US side refuses to allow the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives to use Chinese and Korean to send telegrams to Panmunjom in accordance with the Armistice Agreement and the Joint Red Cross Team's agreement, but forces them to send telegrams in English and deliberately delays the telegrams sent. The telegrams sent by the Korean-Chinese representatives visiting Jeju Island on August 7, 8, and 9 were only handed over to our side by the US side together on the 10th. The longest delay was 79 hours.

All the unreasonable behaviors of the US military authorities towards the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives fully demonstrate that the US side completely disregards the Joint Red Cross Team's working agreement and Articles 57(5) and 57(i) of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives' protest against the US side's behavior that violates the agreement is completely justified. However, US Red Cross representative Nidling said that the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives have consistently been "unreasonable."

In contrast to the US side's various restrictions on the Korean-Chinese Red Cross representatives, the Korean-Chinese side has provided various conveniences for the work of the United Nations Command Red Cross representatives visiting Korean-Chinese prisoner-of-war camps. The United Nations Command Red Cross representatives have full freedom of activity in our area. The United Nations Command representatives of the Kaesong group of the Joint Red Cross Team can hold座谈会(forums) with prisoners of war, conduct free visits, and deliver speeches to them. The United Nations Command representatives visiting prisoner-of-war camps in the Yalu River area can visit prisoners of war and prisoner-of-war representatives, and visit the dormitories, kitchens, and medical facilities of the prisoner-of-war camps. They immediately begin work upon arrival at the prisoner-of-war camp. Before starting work, the prisoner-of-war camp authorities and the Joint Red Cross Team always conduct detailed consultations, and the opinions of the Joint Red Cross Team are always respected. There is no time limit for them to talk with prisoners of war. Jerome, the chief representative of the United Nations Command side sent to our prisoner-of-war camps by the Joint Red Cross Team, believes that: "The treatment and cooperation we have received can be described as exemplary." Even US Red Cross representative Nicholson had to admit that the representatives sent by the US side to our prisoner-of-war camps received "exemplary logistical support."

The two completely different attitudes of the Korean-Chinese side and the US side towards the Red Cross representatives fully demonstrate that the Korean-Chinese side has consistently treated prisoners of war with a humanitarian attitude, and therefore is willing to let the Joint Red Cross Team fully understand the true situation of the prisoner-of-war camps, while the US side, because they have consistently treated prisoners of war in an inhuman way, must try their best to obstruct the visit of the Korean-Chinese representatives, for fear of revealing the truth. The Red Cross representatives of the United Nations Command side should handle this matter in accordance with the Red Cross's traditional humanitarian spirit and in accordance with the Armistice Agreement and the Joint Red Cross Team's working agreement, and should not succumb to the US military authorities and allow them to arbitrarily violate the agreement.

### 美国军事当局百般阻挠朝中红十字会代表的访问工作  证明美方害怕泄露其迫害战俘的真相

    美国军事当局百般阻挠朝中红十字会代表的访问工作
    证明美方害怕泄露其迫害战俘的真相
    【新华社开城十九日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：由于美国军事当局的百般阻挠，在南朝鲜访问美方战俘营、向战俘提供人道主义服务的朝中红十字会代表的工作，实际上已经陷于停顿，其中济州岛分组并已被迫由南朝鲜回到板门店。对于美国军事当局的这种违反停战协定的无理行为，参加联合红十字会小组的美方红十字会的代表们，不但没有按照红十字会的传统的人道主义精神向美方作出应有的表示，反而不顾事实，替他们进行辩解和掩饰。
    事实是：美方处处限制朝中红十字会代表访问战俘的活动。无论在济州岛、巨济岛、釜山、汶山、临津江桥、永登浦，美方都无理地限制朝中代表访问战俘的时间；在巨济岛，美方甚至只许代表们隔着铁丝网，在距离一百公尺左右的地方观看。在永登浦，美方限制朝中代表与战俘谈话时间竟只有三分钟。美方还无理地禁止朝鲜代表对战俘致慰问词，并且用种种藉口取消朝中代表对战俘的访问。可是美国红十字会代表詹尼微却说，“这是由于协定中规定无论在北朝鲜或南朝鲜对战俘的接触不能超过四个钟头。”这种话是完全没有根据的。无论是停战协定中或联合红十字会小组的协议中都没有规定联合红十字会小组和战俘接触的时间限制。相反，停战协定中规定各方司令官应该与联合红十字会小组充分合作。事实上，美方现在根本不让朝中红十字会代表和战俘接触。
    事实是：美方不但不能保证朝中红十字会代表的安全，反而公然迫害他们。在巨济岛访问的朝中红十字会代表曾遭到毒气袭击达一小时之久。在临津江桥的朝中红十字会代表竟然遭到美国卫兵查尔斯·赫其拉夫特用步枪撞击。赫其拉夫特在调查中承认他是奉到命令这样干的。可是当朝中代表要求处分这个卫兵时，亲自调查了这个事件的美方红十字会的代表克鲁兹却说这个指责是“没有根据的”，说什么这个卫兵对朝中代表造成的人体损伤是“看不见的”。照这样说来，美国士兵尽可以继续攻击朝中代表，只要造成的损伤是“看不见的”就行。
    事实是：美方提供给朝中红十字会代表的译员是不能完满执行他的任务的。美方提供给访问济州岛的朝中代表的译员是不能说中国话的，而这个人又不能完全听懂英语。因此他事实上不可能正确传达双方的意见。朝中代表对此表示不满是完全有理由的。可是美国红十字会代表威廉斯却说是朝中代表“规定了自己的一套翻译规则”，企图把责任反过来加在朝中红十字会代表头上。
    事实是：美方不肯按照停战协定及联合红十字会小组协议让朝中红十字会代表使用中、朝文向板门店拍发电报，而强迫他们用英文发报，并且对所发电报故意加以积压。访问济州岛的朝中代表在八月七、八、九日三天发出的电报，美方到十日才一起交给我方。电报积压时间最长的达七十九小时。
    美方军事当局对待朝中红十字会代表的一切无理行为，充分说明美方完全无视联合红十字会小组工作协议，和朝鲜停战协定第五十七款丑项之五和寅项的规定。朝中红十字会代表对美方这种破坏协议的行为提出抗议是完全正当的。可是美国红十字会的代表尼德林却说朝中红十字会代表一贯“不讲理”。
    和美方对朝中红十字会代表的种种限制相反，朝中方面为联合国军红十字会代表访问朝中战俘营的工作提供了种种便利。联合国军红十字会代表在我方地区有充分的活动自由。联合红十字会小组开城分组的联合国军代表可以和战俘举行座谈会，进行自由访问，向他们发表演说。在鸭绿江一带访问战俘营的联合国军代表可以访问战俘和战俘代表，参观战俘营的宿舍、厨房和医疗设施。他们一到战俘营就立刻开始工作。在开始工作以前，战俘营当局和联合红十字会小组双方总是进行详尽的协商，联合红十字会小组的意见总是受到尊重。他们和战俘进行谈话的时间是没有限制的。联合红十字会小组派到我方战俘营的联合国军方面首席代表朱洛姆认为：“我们受到的待遇以及合作的情况堪称模范。”甚至美国红十字会代表尼科尔逊也不得不承认说，美方派到我方战俘营的代表们得到“模范的后勤支援”。
    朝中方面和美方对待红十字会代表的两种截然不同的态度，充分说明了朝中方面是一贯以人道主义态度对待战俘的，因此愿意让联合红十字会小组尽量了解战俘营的真情实况，而美方却由于他们一贯以非人道的态度对待战俘，因此他们要竭力阻挠朝中代表的访问，唯恐泄露真相。联合国军方面的红十字会代表们应该按照红十字会传统的人道主义精神并根据停战协定及联合红十字会小组的工作协议来加以处理，而不应该屈从于美方军事当局，听凭他们任意破坏协议。
