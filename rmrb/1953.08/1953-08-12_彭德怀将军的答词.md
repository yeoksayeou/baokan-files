General Peng Dehuai's Reply

Respected Representatives, Fellow Compatriots, Comrades:

I, with boundless excitement and gratitude, represent the Chinese People's Volunteers in paying respects to the great people of our motherland, from whom we have been separated for more than two years! I pay respects to our great leader, Chairman Mao!

For three years, the Chinese People's Volunteers, carrying out the will of the people of the motherland, fought alongside the heroic Korean People's Army against the American aggressors. After a fierce struggle, we finally achieved a glorious victory. This victory and glory should be attributed to the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army! It should be attributed to the great people of our motherland! It should be attributed to all peace-loving forces in the world, headed by the Soviet Union!

For three years, the people of our motherland have been carrying out economic, national defense, and cultural construction, while also conducting the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea, providing the Volunteers with extremely warm support, giving us an endless supply of material support and spiritual encouragement, enabling us to smoothly strike at the aggressors, until today's victory. On behalf of all the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the people of our motherland for their full support!

Now the Korean War has been brought to a halt. We warmly welcome the armistice and will resolutely implement all the provisions of the armistice agreement, because this is the result of our struggle. But this is only the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. Belligerent elements in the United Nations forces, especially the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea, may break the armistice agreement at any time. People all over the world must be highly vigilant and monitor their conspiracies. The Chinese People's Volunteers are now continuing to stand together with the Korean people, firmly defending their glorious posts, and striving to ensure the complete realization of the Korean armistice agreement and to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. We believe that if the enemy dares to break faith and destroy the armistice agreement and launch another aggression, they will suffer an even more shameful defeat.

\tLong live peace and victory!
\tLong live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!
\tLong live our great motherland!
\tLong live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    彭德怀将军的答词各位代表、各界同胞、各位同志：
    我抱着无限的兴奋和感激，代表中国人民志愿军，向分别了两年多的伟大的祖国人民致敬！向我们伟大的领袖毛主席致敬！
    三年来，中国人民志愿军，执行祖国人民的意志，和英雄的朝鲜人民军一道，抗拒美国侵略者。经过了严重的斗争，终于取得了光荣的胜利。这个胜利和光荣应该归功于英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军！归功于我们伟大的祖国人民！归功于以苏联为首的全世界一切爱好和平的力量！
    三年来，祖国人民一面进行着经济、国防、文化的建设工作，一面进行着伟大的抗美援朝斗争，给予志愿军以无比热烈的支援，使我们获得了源源不绝的物质上的供应和精神上的鼓舞，使我们得以顺利地打击侵略者，直到今天的胜利。我代表中国人民志愿军全体同志，向全力支援我们的祖国人民，表示衷心的感谢！
    现在朝鲜已经停战了。我们热烈欢迎停战，并将坚决执行停战协定的一切规定，因为这是我们奋斗得来的结果。但这只是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。联合国军中的好战分子，尤其是南朝鲜李承晚集团，可能随时破坏停战协定。全世界人民必须以高度的警惕监视着他们的阴谋活动。中国人民志愿军现在正继续与朝鲜人民在一起，坚守自己光荣的岗位，为保障朝鲜停战协定的彻底实现，争取和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗。我们相信，如果敌人敢于背信弃义破坏停战协定，再一次发动侵略，即将遭到更可耻的失败。
        和平胜利万岁！
        中朝人民牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
        我们伟大的祖国万岁！
        我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
