	Mass Sports Activities Developing in Guangzhou
	Mass sports activities in factories, schools, and government offices in Guangzhou are gradually developing.

	The Guangzhou Workers' Cultural Palace is the central base for workers' sports activities in the city. It regularly organizes various sports competitions for workers. The workers' men's and women's basketball and volleyball competitions held at the beginning of this year involved more than seventy grassroots trade unions. The recent workers' swimming competition had 360 athletes from more than thirty units participating. The Workers' Cultural Palace also held a calisthenics performance, promoting gymnastics activities among workers throughout the city. Currently, more than forty factories in the city with more than 100 employees have basketball, volleyball, or soccer team organizations, with thousands of worker athletes emerging. The grassroots trade union of the private No. 1 Zhongnan Tobacco Factory has even hired a full-time sports instructor. Sixteen secondary schools in Guangzhou have implemented the "Labor Defense System" or "Physical Training Standards," with more than 10,000 students participating. During extracurricular activity time at the South China Institute of Technology every day, all twenty-plus basketball courts, thirty-plus volleyball courts, and twenty-plus horizontal bars, parallel bars, and vaulting boxes are crowded with people engaged in sports activities. Many departments have more than 90% of their students regularly participating in sports activities. Calisthenics are also being widely promoted among government officials in Guangzhou. Every morning, when the Guangzhou People's Broadcasting Station broadcasts the calisthenics program, many officials in Shamian, Central Park, and other areas do calisthenics to the rhythm of the music.
	
	Shenyang Establishes Hui Cultural Center
	With the recovery and development of national economic construction and the continuous improvement of people's material lives, the cultural needs of the broad masses of people are becoming increasingly urgent. The Shenyang Municipal People's Government, based on the cultural needs of ethnic minorities, has established a Hui Cultural Center in the Beishi District (a district with a large Hui population). The center is equipped with a large number of books, newspapers, and magazines. The center officially opened on August 14. Since its opening, an average of about 300 people have gone to read books and newspapers every day, most of whom are Hui people. Imams (religious leaders) from various mosques in Shenyang also sometimes go to read books and newspapers.
