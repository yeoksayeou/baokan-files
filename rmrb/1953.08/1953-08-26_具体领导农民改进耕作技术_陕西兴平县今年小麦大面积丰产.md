Specifically Leading Farmers to Improve Farming Techniques
Large-Scale Bumper Harvest of Wheat in Xingping County, Shaanxi This Year

Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, has completed a large-scale general bumper harvest plan for more than 67,000 mu of wheat.

The total area of large-scale bumper harvest wheat in Xingping County this year is 67,156 mu, including 8,454 mu of paddy fields and 58,702 mu of dry land. The average yield per mu is 304 jin and 11 liang, exceeding the original planned yield by 86 jin and 11 liang. Many farmers happily said: This is a bumper harvest that hasn't been seen in many years.

The fact that Xingping County has a large-scale bumper harvest of wheat shows that as long as specific leadership is provided, farming techniques are improved, and the specific difficulties of farmers in production are resolved, a bumper harvest can be obtained. As early as last autumn, before the wheat was sown, the county identified 85 villages with better wheat growing conditions, such as Douma and Suozai, as wheat bumper harvest villages, and in September, a symposium was held for district heads, production assistants, and representatives of bumper harvest villages. At the meeting, the "Winter Wheat Bumper Harvest Technology Implementation Outline" issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government was studied, and the issue of cultivating large-scale bumper harvests within the county was discussed. During the discussion, some cadres had the idea of "being afraid of being overwhelmed" and some farmers were concerned about "being afraid of increasing the burden." After analysis, criticism and explanation, the ideological obstacles of cadres and the masses of farmers in cultivating large-scale bumper harvest wheat were first cleared. The key to increasing wheat production—timely sowing and close planting in rows—was emphasized. The lesson of 1951, when wheat was sown too early (around the Autumn Equinox), the wheat seedlings grew vigorously in winter, resulting in reduced production, was summarized, making the representatives deeply aware of the importance of "timely sowing." The advantages of close planting in rows were also explained to the representatives in the farmers' vernacular: "Wheat yields are low when the planting is sparse." After this meeting, many bumper harvest villages formulated bumper harvest plans and cultivated according to the experience learned at the meeting. For example, the wheat sowing time in bumper harvest villages was mostly three to five days before the Cold Dew, according to the temperature and soil moisture at that time. At the same time, close planting was generally achieved, with a sowing amount of more than 11 or 12 jin per mu; the number of those who implemented row planting along with close planting also increased significantly, with row planting areas in 85 bumper harvest village townships accounting for 95.5 percent of the total bumper harvest area.

In order to do a good job in field management during each season of wheat growth, Xingping County convened representatives of bumper harvest villages on January 5th and March 15th respectively to conduct detailed studies and arrangements for wheat seedling protection and prevention and control of diseases, frost, and pests. For example, the wheat fields in Weijia Village, Banqiao Township, were severely damaged by wild geese in previous years. The masses called the wheat fields on the northwest slope of the village the "Goose Field." After five goose herding groups were organized after this meeting, not a single mu of wheat field was pecked by geese this year. Each bumper harvest village also universally established covenants prohibiting livestock grazing and green harvesting. This year, the wheat seedlings were rarely damaged and generally grew vigorously.

Not long after Xingping County began cultivating large-scale bumper harvest wheat, it also paid attention to promoting advanced farming experience and conducting extensive patriotic education among farmers. For example, after the first symposium of representatives of bumper harvest villages, most villages did a good job, but farmers in individual villages were not very enthusiastic. The Zhongxi Village of Dananhan in the Fourth District did not implement close planting when sowing wheat, with an average of only 8 jin of seeds sown per mu, resulting in many missing seedlings. Furthermore, when mobilizing the masses to weed, some village farmers were not enthusiastic, with some saying "Nine out of ten wheat fields are not weeded," and others saying "We didn't weed in previous years and still harvested grain." After the county leaders heard these reports, they believed that in order to develop the movement in a balanced way, it was necessary to carry out the necessary political and ideological education for the farmers to stimulate the masses' patriotic enthusiasm for increasing production. Therefore, at the second symposium of representatives of bumper harvest villages, a red flag competition for patriotic bumper harvests was launched, and it was decided to conduct inspections in stages. Comrade Zhang Qingshan, the county magistrate, specially explained to the representatives the great significance of increasing grain production for the country and carrying out the red flag competition. After the red flag competition was launched, 85 bumper harvest village townships immediately presented a scene of production upsurge. Farmers in Dabaozi, Xiezhuang Township, Fifth District, planted the red flag they had pre-empted on the city wall, and the entire village's enthusiasm for production increased even more. After the representative of Shicun Village in Suozai Township returned, they automatically challenged the other eight villages in the township. The day after the red flag competition challenge in Weijia Village, Banqiao Township, the entire village launched a fertilizer application campaign.

After the masses' enthusiasm for increasing production was high, it was necessary to foresee and solve the farmers' more significant difficulties in production, so that the movement could be carried out normally. In Xingping County, the more significant and universal difficulty was the fertilizer problem. Before wheat was to be fertilized, county leaders and veteran farmers studied and proposed that the dilapidated city walls of each village were a good source of fast-acting fertilizer, suitable for topdressing. Many village farmers followed this advice after hearing it, and applied topdressing to the wheat fields in a timely manner. As a result of applying city wall fertilizer, the area of topdressed wheat fields in each bumper harvest village was more than 80 percent, an increase of about 20 percent compared to previous years.

With the development of the bumper harvest movement, it is very necessary to conduct scientific technical guidance, especially on some key technical issues that determine the bumper harvest of wheat. For example, in order to solve the problem of wheat lodging, of the 67,000+ mu of wheat in the 85 bumper harvest village townships of Xingping County, 38,136 mu were planted with Bima No. 1. Although this type of wheat has the characteristic of being resistant to lodging, its branches and stems are too high, the ears are large and the kernels are plump, and it is mostly planted in the Loess Plateau area. If it encounters strong winds and heavy rain, it is prone to lodging. Last year, the bumper harvest wheat of Ma Hefa, a farmer in Douma Village, suffered serious yield reduction due to lodging. This year, County Magistrate Zhang Qingshan paid close attention to this issue. In March, he went to Douma and other places to inspect the situation of applying plant ash to prevent lodging, and instructed the comrades of the agricultural technology guidance station to carefully carry out the teaching work in this area. After a series of work by the Xingping County Agricultural Technology Guidance Station, many farmers initially understood the scientific method of "separating ash, urine, and manure for storage," changing the previous erroneous saying of "To eat wheat, urine and ash must be used." Many bumper harvest households applied plant ash. For example, in the spring, in some areas, wireworms occurred in the wheat fields, and farmers were at a loss. The comrades of the technical guidance station proposed the simple method of "hand digging" for remediation. With the assistance of Comrade Wang Zuoli of the Technical Guidance Station, farmers in Douma Township dug out 38,482 wireworms in two days using the "hand digging" method, which played a significant role in preventing the occurrence of missing seedlings in wheat.

Xingping County's cultivation of large-scale bumper harvest wheat has been basically successful. However, there are still some shortcomings: First, individual district and township cadres did not provide enough specific leadership to the bumper harvest villages, relying solely on the bumper harvest representatives, which affected the development of the movement. For example, in Jingangsi Village, Eighth District, the bumper harvest representatives were relatively weak, and the district and township cadres did not provide good assistance, so the work was poorly done. Second, insufficient attention was paid to leveraging the role of mutual aid teams. At the beginning of the movement, villages were used as competition units, and most villages and townships did not conduct chain competitions within their own villages and townships, neglecting the strength of mutual aid organizations. These are all things that deserve attention in the future.

    具体领导农民改进耕作技术
    陕西兴平县今年小麦大面积丰产
    陕西省兴平县完成六万七千余亩小麦大面积的普遍丰产计划。
    兴平县今年的大面积丰产小麦，共六万七千一百五十六亩，其中水地八千四百五十四亩，旱地五万八千七百零二亩，平均每亩产量三百零四斤十一两，高出原订计划产量八十六斤十一两。许多农民都高兴地说：这是多年来没有过的丰收。
    兴平县大面积小麦丰产的事实，说明了只要具体领导，改进耕作技术，解决农民在生产中的具体困难，就可以得到丰收。早在去年秋季，小麦还没有播种前，该县即确定以窦马、索在等小麦生长条件较好的八十五个村为小麦丰产村，并在九月间召开了各区区长、生产助理员和丰产村代表座谈会。会上学习了中央农业部颁发的“冬小麦丰产技术施行纲要”，讨论了在全县范围内培养大面积丰产的问题。讨论中，有些干部有“怕多了顾不过来”的思想和部分农民有“怕增加负担”的顾虑，经过分析批判和解释，首先扫清干部和农民群众在培养大面积丰产小麦上的思想障碍。并着重对小麦增产的关键——适时下种，条播密植作了研究，总结了
    一九五一年因小麦下种过早（秋分前后），麦苗冬季发旺，遭致减产的教训，使代表们深刻认识到“适时下种”的重要，对条播密植也用农民中“麦打不下是稀了”的庄稼话，向代表们进行了教育。这次会后，许多丰产村都订了丰产计划，按照会上学到的经验进行耕作。如丰产村的小麦下种时间，大都按照当时气温、地墒，在寒露前三、五日播种。同时一般也都作到了密植，每亩下种量多在十一、二斤左右；随着密植实行条播者，也显著增加，计八十五个丰产村乡的条播面积已占到总丰产面积的百分之九十五点五。
    为了在小麦生长的各个季节，做好田间管理，兴平县又分别在一月五日和三月十五日召集各丰产村代表开会，对小麦保苗和防治病、霜、虫害，都作了详细研究和布置。例如板桥乡魏家村的麦田，往年大雁为害很厉害，群众称该村西北坡的麦田为
    “雁场子”，这次会后组织了五个吆雁组后，今年的麦田没有一亩受到雁啄。各丰产村还普遍订立禁放牲畜和禁止采青公约，今年麦苗很少受损，普遍生长健旺。
    兴平县在培养大面积丰产小麦开始不久，还注意到推广先进的耕作经验，还必须向农民进行广泛的爱国主义教育。例如第一次丰产村代表座谈会后，大部分村庄都作的较好，但个别村庄农民劲头不大。四区大南韩中西村，在小麦下种的时候，就没有实行密植，每亩平均仅下了八斤种子，缺苗很多。再如发动群众锄草时，有些村子的农民就不起劲，有的说“十麦九不锄”，有的说“往年不锄照样打粮食”。县领导上听到这些反映后，认为要使运动平衡发展，必须向农民进行必要的政治思想教育，激发群众的爱国增产热情。于是，就在第二次丰产村代表会上，掀起爱国丰产红旗竞赛，并决定分期检查。县长张青山同志，特别向到会代表讲解了为国家增产粮食和开展红旗竞赛的伟大意义。红旗竞赛开展后，八十五个丰产村乡立即呈现出一片生产热潮。五区解庄乡大堡子的农民，把预夺的红旗插在城头上，全村人生产热劲更大了。索在乡史村的代表回去后，自动向该乡其他八个村挑战。板桥乡魏家村在红旗竞赛挑战后的第二天，全村就展开了施肥运动。
    群众增产热情高涨以后，紧接着就要有预见解决农民在生产中比较重大的困难，使运动正常开展。在兴平县来说，比较重大而且带有普遍性的困难，是肥料问题。在小麦要施肥前，县领导干部曾和老农研究，提出各村的破旧城墙，是一批很好的速效肥料，适宜施追肥。许多村子的农民听到后，就照着办，给麦地适时上了追肥。由于施用城墙肥料的结果，各丰产村施追肥麦田面积都在百分之八十以上，较往年增加百分之二十左右。
    随着丰产运动的开展，进行科学的技术指导，是非常必要的，尤其是一些决定小麦丰产关键性的技术问题。例如解决小麦倒伏的问题，兴平县八十五个丰产村乡的六万七千余亩小麦，其中种碧蚂一号的即占三万八千一百三十六亩。这种麦子虽有抗倒伏的特性，但枝杆过高，穗大颗肥，且多种植在塬上地区，若遇狂风暴雨，就容易倒伏。去年该县窦马村农民马合法的丰产麦子就是因为倒伏遭致了严重的减产。今年县长张青山非常注意这个问题，三月间，专门去窦马等地，检查了一次施用草木灰防止倒伏的情形，他并指示农业技术指导站的同志，要细致地作好这一方面的传授工作。兴平县农业技术指导站经过一系列的工作，使许多农民初步懂得了
    “灰尿粪分存”的科学方法，改变了过去“要吃麦，尿泼灰”的错误说法，许多丰产组户都施用了草木灰。再如春季有些地区，麦田发生金针虫，农民束手无策，技术指导站的同志，就提出用“手刨”的简便办法进行补救。窦马乡的农民，在技术指导站王佐礼同志的协助下，用“手刨”的办法，两天就刨出金针虫三万八千四百八十二个，对防止小麦发生缺苗现象，起了很大的作用。
    兴平县培养大面积丰产小麦，基本上是成功的。但还存在着一些缺点：一，个别区、乡干部对丰产村具体领导不够，仅依赖丰产代表，影响运动开展。如八区金刚寺村，丰产代表较弱，区乡干部也没有很好帮助，工作就做的差。二，对发挥互助组的作用注意不够，运动一开始，就以村为竞赛单位，大部分村乡又没有在本村、乡范围内连环竞赛，忽视了互助组织的力量。这些都是值得今后注意的。
