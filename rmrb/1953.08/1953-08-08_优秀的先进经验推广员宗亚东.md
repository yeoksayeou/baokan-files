    Excellent Advanced Experience Promoter Zong Yadong
    Zhao Dianzhong, Lian Xinghai
    On the newly erected scaffolding of the No. 201 construction site, bricklayers are working hard, sweating profusely. In the crowd, there is a particularly noticeable person. He walks from one group to another, holding bricks in both hands, demonstrating the double-handed mortar squeezing bricklaying method as if walking on a level road. His skillful technique and brilliant skills often elicit applause from the workers. This is Zong Yadong, an excellent promoter of advanced experience.

    Zong Yadong is an old bricklayer who has significantly improved both his skills and awareness after winter training. When the construction site started, the Second Engineering Company of Jilin Province sent him as an advanced experience promoter. He felt his responsibility was too great, but he was confident that he would complete the task assigned by the Party.

    On May 9th, when the school building walls began to be built, most workers were reluctant to use double-handed mortar squeezing, fearing that they could not guarantee quality, that it would not be smooth, that it would be tiring, and some were afraid of not getting paid. After learning about the workers' thoughts and unfamiliarity with the double-handed mortar squeezing method, Zong Yadong went deep among them, personally helping the workers to use double-handed mortar squeezing. He first went to Tian Xishan's group and found that the group's division of labor was not clear, and the mortar was squeezed and bumped randomly during bricklaying, and the brick head mortar was too large. He helped them establish a division of labor and responsibility system, stipulating that each person should be one meter away to avoid squeezing and bumping. He also told them that the brick head mortar should not exceed three centimeters when laying headers and should not exceed five centimeters when laying stretchers, and they should pay attention to avoiding squeezing the mortar of the bottom row into the groove. In this way, the group smoothly used the double-handed mortar squeezing method.

    The old bricklayer Su Shangqin threw down his trowel. As soon as he used double-handed mortar squeezing, he was covered in sweat, and his hands were also rubbed raw. He complained, "Doing this is really killing me, don't expect to keep your fingers, this is purely the promoter being full and having nothing to do, making a fuss." When Old Zong heard this, he immediately went over to explain to him and patiently said, "Old Su, don't worry, you'll get used to it after a couple of times. Besides, your method is not right. When laying to the left, you should use your left hand first and then your right hand; when laying stretchers, you should also use your left hand first and then your right hand. Why are you using your left hand first and then your right hand when laying to the right?" Then he personally went over to teach him until he was proficient.

    Old Zong's style of close contact with the masses is very popular among the workers. Everyone affectionately calls him "our Master Zong." But he is never proud or complacent, always patiently helping everyone, carefully studying problems, discovering problems, and solving problems. One day, he found that some groups were not squeezing (full) mortar, and some old workers were taking bricks themselves, constantly touching the trowel. When apprentices were grouting, they were randomly scraping with a scraper, and the mortar flowing was very serious. Old Zong gave them individual explanations of the errors of this method, and slowly everyone got used to it. And they said, "We are right to listen to Master Zong."

    When building the wall, there was no problem using double-handed mortar squeezing, but when it came to piers, it was still solo work. Old Zong used the method of detailed accounting to explain the disadvantages of working alone and mobilized everyone to use the three-stage bricklaying method, which can avoid idling and mutual uncoordinated problems. After his mobilization, the three-stage bricklaying method was widely used on the piers.

    Old Zong was not satisfied with the gains he had made. He always thought: Can the double-handed mortar squeezing method be used on the piers? He thought about it again and again, wanting to use the method of a mortar spreader on the piers. At this time, the leadership of the construction site gave him a task, which was to promote the double-handed mortar squeezing method on the piers throughout the construction site. He convened a forum of old bricklayer technicians and asked them to express their opinions and study the use of the double-handed mortar squeezing method on the piers. After everyone's discussion, he concentrated everyone's wisdom, and as a result, it was successfully researched. In order to be more confident in universal promotion, he conducted experiments in Wang Hongjun's bricklaying group. According to the size of the wall, he rationally organized the labor force, changing the original fifteen-person group into two six-person groups, with the remaining three people doing work such as sending wedges, and a second-level worker specializing in laying the corners of the wall. In this way, on June 21st, when building a two-and-a-half brick wall with five windows, the double-handed mortar squeezing method was used. Each person laid an average of 1,300 bricks, which was almost as fast as a large flat wall. One of the four large groups still didn't believe it, so he took them to see it. In the face of the facts, the leader of that group said: "Our brains are too rigid. In the future, we must listen to the promoter." From then on, advanced experience was promoted 100% in all bricklayer trades.

    优秀的先进经验推广员宗亚东
    赵殿忠  连兴海
    在二○一工地新起的楼架上，瓦工们正在汗流满面地劳动着。在人群里，有一个特别引人注目的人，他从这组走到那组，两手擎着砖，像走平道似的，表演着双手挤浆砌砖法。他的熟练的手法，精采的技巧，时时引起工人们拍掌。这就是优秀的先进经验推广员宗亚东。
    宗亚东是个老瓦工，经过冬训以后，无论是技术和觉悟，都有了显著的提高。工地开工，吉林省第二工程公司就派他当先进经验推广员。他感到自己的责任太大，但他却有信心一定完成党所交给的任务。
    五月九日，开始砌校舍墙的时候，大部分工人不愿使双手挤浆，怕保不住质量，不顺手，怕累，有的怕拿不着工资。宗亚东了解到工人们的思想和不熟悉双手挤浆法的毛病，就深入下去，亲自动手帮助工人使用双手挤浆。他首先到田喜山小组里，发现小组分工不明确，砌砖时乱挤乱碰，砖的碰头灰过大，就帮助他们建立分工专责制度，规定出每人要离一公尺远，免得挤碰。并告诉他们砖的碰头灰砌丁头不得超过三公分，砌长身不得超过五公分，要注意避免把底下那行灰挤出沟来。这样小组就顺利地使用双手挤浆法了。
    老瓦工苏尚勤，扔下大铲，刚用双手挤浆，就满头大汗，两只手也磨破了。他发牢骚说：“这样干真要命，手指头别指望要了，这纯粹是推广员吃饱了没啥事乱吵一阵。”老宗听见了，马上过去跟他解释，并耐心地说：“老苏，别着急，一遭生，两遭就熟啦，再说你这个拿法也不对，往左砌，应该是先左手后右手；砌长身，也是先左手后右手，你怎么往右砌也是先左手后右手呢？”然后又亲手过去教，直到把他教熟了为止。
    老宗的密切联系群众的作风，很受工人拥护。大家都亲切地称呼他为“我们的宗师傅”。但他从来不骄傲不自满，总是耐心地帮助大家，仔细地研究问题，发现问题，解决问题。有一天，他发现有的组挤浆时不叫（满）浆，有的老工人自己取砖，动不动就摸大铲。徒工灌浆时拿爬子乱扒拉，流浆情形很严重。老宗就给他们个别解释这种作法的错误，慢慢地大家都习惯了。并且说：“咱们听宗师傅的话没错。”
    砌墙身时，使用双手挤浆是没有问题了，但一到垛子，还是单干。老宗就用算细账的方法，讲解单干的坏处，并发动大家用三段砌砖法，这样可以避免窝工和互相不协调的毛病。经过他的动员，垛子上普遍使用了三段砌砖法。
    老宗并没有满足于既得的成绩，老是想：垛子上能不能用双手挤浆法呢？他左想右想，想在垛子上使用铺灰器的办法。这时工地领导上给他一个任务，就是要在全工地推广垛子上双手挤浆法。他就召集瓦工老技工开了个座谈会，请老技工发表意见，研究垛子上使用双手挤浆法。经过大家讨论，他又集中了大家的智慧，结果研究成功了。他为了更有把握普遍地推广，就在王洪钧瓦工小组进行试验，根据墙的大小，合理地组织了劳动力，把原来的十五人组，改为两个六人小组，余三名作发楦等工作，由一名二级工专门砌墙角。这样，六月二十一日，砌二比半墙，五个窗口，都用双手挤浆法，每人平均砌一千三百块，快跟大平墙一样多了。四个大组里有一个组还不相信，他就把他们领来看看。在事实面前，那个组的组长说：“我们的脑筋也太死啦，今后一定要听推广员的话。”从此，瓦工全工种百分之百地推广了先进经验。
