    The state-owned grain departments and cooperatives throughout the country have completed 105.14% of the original monthly plan for wheat procurement in July, an increase of 10.07% compared to the actual procurement in June of this year, and an increase of 10.35% compared to the actual procurement in the same period last year. However, the completion of the July wheat procurement plan by major administrative regions is very uneven. East China and Southwest China have performed better, exceeding the monthly plan by more than 20%; Central South and Northeast China have also completed the monthly plan; North China has not completed the monthly plan; Northwest China only completed 36.51% of the monthly plan. The procurement volume in July in East China, Southwest China, and Central South China increased to varying degrees compared to the same period last year, but the procurement volume in North China decreased by 24.41% compared to the same period last year, and Northwest China also decreased by 13.98%.

    In Hebei, Shaanxi and other provinces, the regions with poor procurement performance in the past have made some progress in wheat procurement after inspection and supervision by the local Party and government leaders and appropriate strengthening of market management. In Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanxi and other provinces, most regions have learned from the procurement experience in June. State-owned commercial enterprises, cooperatives, grain departments and other departments timely and actively organized the supply of materials and went to the countryside with goods to supply the means of production and livelihood needed by farmers. Farmers sold wheat one after another, which increased the amount of wheat purchased. For example, in late July, after most areas of Shandong Province coordinated material supply with wheat procurement, the daily procurement volume in the province increased from more than 11 million jin to more than 15 million jin. Among them, Wendeng County surged from only 40,000 to 50,000 jin per day in the past to 200,000 jin. In some areas of Henan Province, a prior survey of farmers' needs was conducted, and then goods were taken to the countryside, or small-scale material exchange meetings were held to facilitate farmers' sales of wheat and purchase of goods, and the amount of wheat purchased also increased significantly.

    The experience of wheat procurement work in July proves that the quality of the work of organizing materials and supplying farmers' needs is an important condition for completing and overfulfilling procurement tasks. Wherever this work is valued, the procurement volume has increased significantly; where there is no attention or insufficient attention, the procurement volume is still very small.

    At present, some areas still ignore the important significance of organizing material supply and bringing goods to the countryside, and there is still a phenomenon of "not actively promoting goods when there are goods, and not keeping up when there are no goods." Although some bring goods to the countryside, they are not sufficiently prepared for the goods that farmers like, and fertilizers and agricultural implements are still not meeting the needs of farmers, so that farmers cannot buy the goods they need after selling wheat. This is a problem that needs to be solved urgently in the current wheat procurement work.

    In addition, during the procurement process, in individual areas of Henan Province, contracts were signed by cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and production cooperatives to organize farmers to sell grain collectively, which not only facilitated the masses but also did not delay production. After selling wheat, farmers collectively purchased livestock and other materials. This method is very popular among the masses of farmers.

### 全国七月份小麦收购计划完成  各地区收购工作不平衡华北西北工作落后

    全国七月份小麦收购计划完成
    各地区收购工作不平衡华北西北工作落后
    七月份，国营粮食部门与合作社在全国范围内所收购的小麦，已完成原定月计划的百分之一○五点一四，较今年六月份收购实绩增加百分之一○点○七；较去年同期收购实绩增加百分之一○点三五。但各大行政区对七月份的小麦收购计划完成得很不平衡，华东、西南完成较好，超过月计划百分之二十以上；中南、东北也完成了月计划；华北没有完成月计划；西北只完成月计划的百分之三六点五一。华东、西南、中南等地区七月份的收购量均较去年同期收购量有不同程度的增加，但华北地区的收购量反较去年同期收购量减少百分之二四点四一，西北地区也减少百分之一三点九八。
    河北、陕西等省内，过去收购成绩不好的地区，经过当地党政领导方面的检查督促和适当加强市场管理以后，收购小麦的工作已较前略有进展。河南、山东、江苏、山西等省内，大部地区吸取了六月份收购经验，国营商业、合作社、粮食等部门适时地积极地组织物资供应，并带货下乡，供应农民需要的生产资料与生活资料，农民纷纷售麦，使收购小麦的数量较前增加。如七月下旬，山东省内大部地区配合小麦收购组织物资供应后，全省每天的收购量就由一千一百多万斤增到一千五百多万斤，其中文登县由过去每天只能收进四、五万斤而激增为二十万斤。河南省部分地区，事先调查农民需要，然后带货下乡，或召开小型物资交流会，便利农民售麦买货，收购小麦数量也有显著增加。
    七月份收购小麦工作的经验证明：组织物资、供应农民需要的工作做得好坏，是完成和超额完成收购任务的重要条件。凡是重视这一工作的地区，收购量都有显著增加；没有注意或重视不够的地区收购量仍就很小。
    目前部分地区，有的还忽视组织物资供应和带货下乡的重要意义，还存在着“有货不积极推销、无货跟不上”的现象，有的虽然带货下乡，但是，对于农民喜爱的货品准备不足，肥料和应用农具等还赶不上农民需要，致使农民卖出小麦后买不到所需要的货物，这是当前收购小麦工作中需要迫切解决的问题。
    此外，在收购过程中，河南省内个别地区，由合作社和互助组、生产合作社订立合同，组织农民集体售粮，既便利群众，又不耽误生产，农民在出售小麦后并集体换购了牲口和其他物资。这种方式很受农民群众欢迎。
