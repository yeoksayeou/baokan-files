Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 21st: Our special correspondent reports: In the hospital here that receives sick and wounded personnel returning from South Korea, one out of every four patients suffers from night blindness. A responsible military doctor, Dr. Xiao, said: "This condition is due to a lack of Vitamin A. This shows that the returning prisoners of war universally suffer from malnutrition."

The military doctor also said: "They are now taking Vitamin pills and eating a lot of fresh vegetables every day, and they are gradually getting better."

Due to long-term malnutrition, nearly half of the returning sick prisoners of war also suffer from tuberculosis and other lung diseases.

Patient Hu Didi told the reporter: "In the past, what we ate every day was one pound of coarse rice, ground wheat with husks and beans, plus a few slices of radish and dried vegetables."

This twenty-six-year-old member of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who returned from Prisoner of War Camp No. 8 on Jeju Island, continued: "We ate this kind of thing every day, without any change."

Hu Didi and the returned prisoners of war surrounding him angrily cursed the U.S. prisoner of war camp authorities. They said: "We haven't seen meat or eggs for three years." They all suffer from night blindness.

Hu Didi said: "We were often hungry and exhausted, but the guards still made us work eight to ten hours a day outside the barbed wire, digging trenches and unloading cargo for ships. Those who couldn't do it were kicked and beaten."

The reporter interviewed another Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war, Deng Xuedong, who returned from Prisoner of War Camp No. 1 on Jeju Island. This thirty-four-year-old soldier, who was full of energy two years ago, is now weak and frail. His face is pale, and he suffers from various ailments. He said: "I have 'night blindness', as well as stomach problems and aching limbs. But when they repatriated me, they still considered me a 'physically fit prisoner of war'."

Deng Xuedong said that in the prisoner of war camp where he was detained, many people developed stomach problems because the coarse rice and ground wheat with husks were difficult to digest. He also said: "The guards forced us to sleep on the damp ground, so my limbs often ached."

He continued: "I lived in a tent with eighty other prisoners of war. About thirty-five of us suffered from night blindness. At dusk or before the sun went down, we were like blind men, bumping into you and you bumping into me."

After the "screening" began, the food in the U.S. prisoner of war camps became even worse. At that time, the Americans used hunger as a weapon to destroy the will of the prisoners of war who, regardless of shootings and torture, firmly demanded to go home. The returning prisoners of war said: "They reduced our food supply under various pretexts." Six hundred prisoners of war in U.S. Prisoner of War Camp No. 2 were deprived of food for three days from July 7th to 10th, 1952, for singing songs. The prisoners of war not only had nothing to eat, but they also had no water to drink. The returning prisoners of war said: "The guards shot one of us who wanted to dig a well." During the week of October 11th to 17th, the supply of food and water was reduced by one-third because some people hummed tunes during roll call. During that week, the water faucets were only open for four hours a day instead of six.

During one week in December 1952, the supply of food and water in U.S. Prisoner of War Camp No. 5 was reduced by one-third because the prisoners of war in this camp held a memorial service for a prisoner of war who had been shot and killed by a guard.

Although North Korea suffered great damage due to the bombing by U.S. aircraft, and traffic was blocked, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers treated prisoners of war much better than the Americans did. American and British prisoners of war in North Korea ate bread or rice every day, and they could eat their fill. They could eat meat, eggs, potatoes, and vegetables. On Christmas and other holidays, they could also eat chicken, fish, and other things. They were well taken care of. According to Reuters, the U.S. chief medical officer at Panmunjom, Simmer, was also "surprised that the repatriated prisoners of war did not show any signs of malnutrition."

The humane treatment of prisoners of war in North Korea and the inhumane treatment of prisoners of war in South Korea are a contrast between two worlds.

### 我方归来的病伤人员控诉美方虐待战俘

    我方归来的病伤人员控诉美方虐待战俘
    【新华社开城二十一日电】本社特派记者报道：这里收容从南朝鲜归来的病伤人员的医院里，每四个病人中就有一个人患着夜盲症。一位负责的军医萧医生说：“这种病症是因为缺少维他命A的缘故。这说明了归来的战俘普遍地有着营养不良的现象。”
    这位军医又说：“他们现在每天吃维他命丸和许多新鲜蔬菜，已经渐渐好起来了。”
    由于长期营养不良，归来的生病的战俘几乎有半数还患有肺结核和其他肺部的病症。
    病人胡德弟对记者说：“过去我们每天吃的东西是一磅粗糙的大米、磨碎的带皮的麦子和豆子，再加上几片萝卜和干菜。”
    这个从济州岛第八号战俘营归来的二十六岁的中国人民志愿军人员又说：“我们天天吃这种东西，没有变换过。”
    胡德弟和围在他旁边的归来的被俘人员都愤怒地咒骂美方战俘营当局，他们说：“我们已经有三年没有看见肉和鸡蛋了。”他们都患着夜盲症。
    胡德弟说：“我们常常挨饿，而且疲惫不堪，但是卫兵们还要我们每天在铁丝网外工作八个小时到十个小时，掘壕沟，替船只卸货。做不动的人就被拳打脚踢。”
    记者访问了另一个从济州岛第一号战俘营归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员邓学栋。这个三十四岁的两年前还是精神饱满的战士，现在却变得衰弱不堪了。他面色苍白，患着各种各样的病。他说：“我是‘夜盲’，还有胃病，四肢酸痛。但是他们把我遣返归来的时候，还把我算作‘体格健全的战俘’”。
    邓学栋说，在他被拘留的那个战俘营里，有许多人生了胃病，都因为他们吃粗糙的大米和磨碎的带皮的麦子不易消化的缘故。他又说：“卫兵们强迫我们睡在潮湿的地上，所以我的四肢经常酸痛。”
    他继续说：“我和其他八十个战俘住在一个帐篷里。我们中间约有三十五个人患夜盲症。在黄昏或者太阳还没有落的时候，我们就像瞎子一样，我撞在你身上，你撞在我身上。”
    “甄别”开始以后，美方战俘营内的伙食更糟糕了。那时美国人把饥饿当作一种武器，用来摧毁那些不顾枪杀和酷刑，坚决要求回家的战俘的意志。归来的战俘说：“他们以种种藉口减少我们的食物供应。”美方第二号战俘营的六百个战俘，在一九五二年七月七日到十日曾因为唱歌而被断粮三天。战俘不但没有东西吃，连水也喝不到。归来的战俘说：“卫兵开枪打了我们中间一个想掘井的人。”在十月十一日到十七日的一个星期中，食物和水的供应减少了三分之一，因为有些人在点名时哼了曲子。在那个星期中，水笼头每天不开放六小时而只开放四小时。
    在一九五二年十二月里的一个星期中，美方第五号战俘营的食物和水的供应被减少了三分之一，因为这个战俘营内的战俘为一个被卫兵开枪打死的战俘举行了一个追悼会。
    虽然由于美机的轰炸，朝鲜北部遭到很大破坏，交通受阻，但是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军对战俘的待遇比美国人对战俘的待遇要好得多。在北朝鲜的美国战俘和英国战俘，每天吃的是面包或米饭，而且随他们吃饱。他们可以吃到肉、鸡蛋、马铃薯和蔬菜。到圣诞节和其他节日，他们还能吃到鸡、鱼和其他东西。他们受到了很好的照顾。据路透社报道，美国在板门店的军医长西姆尔也“因为被遣返的战俘没有营养不良现象而感到惊奇”。
    在北朝鲜的战俘受到人道的待遇，而在南朝鲜的战俘却受到不人道的待遇，这是两个世界之间的对照。
