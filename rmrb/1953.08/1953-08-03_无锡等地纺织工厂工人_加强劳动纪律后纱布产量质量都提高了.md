    Weaving Factory Workers in Wuxi and Other Places
    Improved Yarn and Cloth Production Quality After Strengthening Labor Discipline
    Workers in textile factories in Wuxi, Suzhou, Changzhou, Danyang and other places in Jiangsu Province have universally reduced absenteeism and significantly improved the output and quality of yarn and cloth by consciously abiding by labor discipline. In June, Danyang Cotton Spinning Mill overfulfilled its yarn production plan by 2.65 percent and its cloth production plan by 5.75 percent. The rate of substandard cloth also decreased by 2.6 percent compared to the planned target. The unit output of Suzhou No. 1 Silk Factory increased by 12.9 percent. The rate of substandard cloth at Suzhou Yongxin Cloth Factory decreased from about 9.5 percent to about 1 percent.
    Since the launch of labor discipline education in these areas in May, the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers and staff has been universally enhanced. Many factory workers have incorporated adherence to labor discipline into their group plans, regarding labor as a pleasant and glorious thing. One hundred and twenty-six outstanding workers in the state-owned Danyang Textile Factory who consistently abide by labor discipline, obey assignments, and actively engage in production have become models for the masses to learn from. Many factories have basically eliminated phenomena such as unwarranted absenteeism, lateness and early departure, dozing off, seeking cool air, random chatting and singing, violating operating procedures, and disobeying assignments. Although the weather has been very hot recently, attendance rates have generally increased. The attendance rate of Suzhou No. 1 Silk Factory is still more than 2 percent higher than before. Yongxin Cloth Factory has increased nearly 10 percent. The attendance rate of the bobbin section of Changzhou Minfeng Yarn Factory reached 99 percent. Wu Fudi, a female worker in the bobbin workshop of Danyang Cotton Textile Factory, used to be assigned to watch fifty spindles administratively, but she secretly only watched forty-five spindles. She often sought cool air during working hours, and she would ignore it even if more than a dozen threads broke. After labor discipline education, Wu Fudi has become a production expert, increasing from watching forty-five spindles to watching seventy spindles, and her output has also exceeded the planned target. After discussions among workers and staff, many factories have established or revised systems for leave, attendance, and work schedules.

### 无锡等地纺织工厂工人  加强劳动纪律后纱布产量质量都提高了

    无锡等地纺织工厂工人
    加强劳动纪律后纱布产量质量都提高了
    江苏省无锡、苏州、常州、丹阳等地纺织工厂工人，由于自觉遵守劳动纪律，已使各厂的缺勤率普遍下降，纱布的产量和质量显著提高。六月份，丹阳棉纺纱厂纱的产量超额完成计划百分之二点六五，布超额完成计划百分之五点七五；次布率也比计划指标下降了百分之二点六。苏州第一丝厂单位产量增加百分之十二点九。苏州永新布厂次布率从百分之九点五降低到百分之一左右。
    这些地区的纺织工厂自五月份展开劳动纪律教育以后，广大职工的阶级觉悟普遍提高。不少工厂的工人把遵守劳动纪律订到小组计划里面，把劳动看做愉快光荣的事情。国营丹阳纺织厂一百二十六个一贯遵守劳动纪律、服从调配、积极生产的优秀工人已成为群众学习的榜样。许多工厂已基本上消灭了无故旷工、迟到早退、打瞌睡、乘风凉、乱谈乱唱、违犯操作规则和不服从调配等现象。最近天气虽然很热，但出勤率仍普遍提高。苏州第一丝厂的出勤率仍比以前提高百分之二以上。永新布厂提高将近百分之十。常州民丰纱厂筒子间的出勤率达到百分之九十九。丹阳棉纺织厂筒子车间女工吴福弟，过去行政上分配她看五十锭，她背着只看四十五锭，工作时间常在一旁乘风凉，一下断了十多个头她也不管。经过劳动纪律教育后，吴福弟已变成生产能手，由看四十五个锭提高到看七十个锭，产量也超过了计划指标。不少工厂经过职工讨论后，订立或修订了请假、考勤、作息等制度。
