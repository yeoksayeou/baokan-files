    The Victory of Peace
    Soviet Union Iliya Ehrenburg

    Today, Korean mothers are sleeping peacefully for the first time. Today, for the first time in many years, newspapers in Beijing and New York, in Calcutta and London, in Moscow and Paris, do not carry terrifying news of bloodshed and cities razed to the ground. For all of mankind, this is a good day, it is the victory of peace.

    I would first like to express my respect to the heroic, patriotic Korean people, who defended their right to exist and their human dignity with extraordinary self-sacrifice. The Korean patriotic people's resistance greatly contributed to the victory of peace. Military adventurers and those who advocate power politics have realized that their conspiracies are not so easy to realize.

    The Chinese People's Volunteers made a great contribution to the victory of peace. They set an example, demonstrating great friendship, human solidarity, noble qualities, and the great spirit of sacrificing one's life for the happiness of neighbors, comrades, and friends.

    The Korean armistice is a victory for the people of all countries. The will and wisdom of the people of all countries have overcome the spirit of slaughter and despotism, napalm bombs and corrupt practices, those who advocate bombing and racists, and all open and hidden forces of war.

    The struggle between peace and war continues. The forces of darkness have not yet been disarmed. They may try to resume the Korean War. They may once again instigate Syngman Rhee to take action. The forces of war may attempt to retaliate for their defeat in Korea elsewhere. They will do their best to intensify the Cold War, obstruct negotiations, and make the people of all countries increasingly uneasy.

    However, the forces of war have suffered a crushing defeat. Now, everyone has realized that agreements can be reached, and reason and speech can stop destructive actions. Now, everyone understands that since the Korean War can be stopped, the Cold War can also be stopped through consultation and mutually acceptable honorable agreements. The people of the world will more forcefully and resolutely demand that their governments hold serious, comprehensive negotiations in order to effectively solve all problems. All honest people in the world say that it is time to end the Cold War, to end that irrational and evil undertaking that will destroy everything and threaten everything. Now, there is a beginning. After the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the proposition of consultation has become an urgent matter.

    Needless to say, the Soviet people are naturally and sincerely happy for the victory of the patriotic Korean people, who have endured suffering to achieve peace. The Soviet people will support any initiative that may contribute to an agreement and free humanity from the nightmare of the danger of war with their labor, their composure, and their true strength.

    和平的胜利
    苏联  伊里亚·爱伦堡
    今天，朝鲜的母亲们第一次安然入睡了。今天，许多年来第一次，在北京和纽约、在加尔各答和伦敦、在莫斯科和巴黎，报纸没有可怕的流血和把城市夷为废墟的消息。对全人类说来，这是一个好日子，这是和平的胜利。
    我首先愿意向英勇的、爱国的、以异乎寻常的自我牺牲精神维护了他们生存的权利和人类尊严的朝鲜人民，表示敬意。朝鲜爱国人民的抗战，大有助于和平的胜利。军事冒险家和鼓吹实力政策的人们已经认识到：他们的阴谋并不是那么容易实现的。
    中国人民志愿军对和平的胜利作了伟大的贡献，他们竖立了一个榜样，表现了伟大的友谊、人类的团结、人的高贵品质、为了邻人、同志和朋友的幸福而牺牲性命的伟大胸襟。
    朝鲜停战是各国人民的胜利，各国人民的意志和才智战胜了屠杀和专制主义精神，战胜了凝固汽油弹和舞弊营私政策，战胜了鼓吹轰炸的人和种族主义者，战胜了一切公开和隐蔽的战争力量。
    和平与战争的搏斗还在继续。黑暗的力量还没有被解除武装。他们还可能设法恢复朝鲜战争。他们可能再次唆使李承晚行动起来。战争力量可能企图在别的地方为他们在朝鲜的失败进行报复。他们将尽力加紧冷战，阻挠谈判，并使得各国人民越来越感到不安。
    不过，战争力量已遭到了一次惨败。现在，人人都已经认识到：协议是能够达成的，理智和言论是可以制止破坏行动的。现在，人人都了解到：既然可以停止朝鲜战争，也就可以通过协商和双方都能接受的光荣协议来停止冷战。世界各国人民将更有力地、更坚决地要求他们的政府举行严肃的、全面的谈判，以便有效地解决一切问题。全世界的正直人民都说，结束冷战的时候到了，结束那件将毁坏一切、威胁到一切的没有理性的、万恶的勾当的时候到了。现在，已经有了一个开头，在朝鲜停战协定签字以后，协商这个主张已经成了迫切的事务。
    不待说，苏联人民自然是热烈地、诚心诚意地为历尽苦难后得到和平的爱国的朝鲜人民的胜利而高兴；苏联人民将以他们的劳动、他们的镇静、他们的真正的力量，支持任何可能促成协议的、使人类解脱战争危险的恶梦的倡议。
