    Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Beijing Post Office Formulates Plan to Strengthen Magazine Distribution Work in the Second Half of the Year
    Letter from the Beijing Post Office of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications: The "Abstracts of Letters from Readers" column published on June 7th contained letters from our employee Zhang Tianxin and Liu Qin'xue from the Nanzhang Post Office in Hubei, exposing the chaotic situation in our bureau's magazine distribution work. Except for some discrepancies in the figures and actual situations, most of the content in these two letters is factual. Our bureau began to actively address this issue in April, and by the end of May, most of the backlog from the first quarter had been resolved. We will continue to make further efforts to improve magazine distribution work.

    Since 1951, after our bureau gradually accepted the distribution work for certain Beijing-published magazines, especially after accepting all Beijing-published magazines this year, the staffing and business systems of our bureau's magazine distribution unit have lagged far behind objective needs. In addition, when the regular fixed-quota distribution system was implemented this year, the quota numbers for many magazines were less than the readers' needs, and the publication dates of various magazines were too concentrated, resulting in serious backlogs and chaos in magazine distribution work. Our lack of political awareness, ideological grounding, and planning when handling specific tasks further prevented the timely resolution of these problems.

    Beginning in the second quarter of this year, the leadership of the distribution department personally led the magazine section to improve its work, mobilizing the masses to clear backlogs, improve labor organization, and gradually establish and strengthen some major business systems (such as the establishment and implementation of a review system and a statistical system, which effectively reduced errors). This not only greatly changed the chaotic situation in the past magazine distribution work but also laid a good foundation for the second half of the year.

    The overall direction of the distribution department's work in the second half of the year is to improve the quality of work. In the third quarter, the focus will be on establishing systems and procedures related to improving work quality, as well as further adjusting labor organization. In the fourth quarter, the goal is to comprehensively improve work quality, formulate quality indicators, and implement the systems established in the third quarter. The distribution department has formulated a work plan for the second half of the year and its implementation points, mobilizing the masses to discuss and implement them. It has also developed specific measures to strengthen political and ideological education within the department and to enhance leadership.

    The readers' letters published in the newspaper have made us remember the lessons of our past work even more firmly, and they have a supervisory role in improving our magazine distribution work in the future.

### 邮电部北京邮局已订出计划  加强下半年的期刊发行工作

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    邮电部北京邮局已订出计划
    加强下半年的期刊发行工作
    邮电部北京邮局来信：六月七日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了我局职工张天心和湖北南漳邮局刘芹学等的两封来信，揭露了我局在杂志发行工作中的混乱现象。这两封来信中，除了部分数字和部分实际情况有出入外，大部分情况都是事实。我局在四月份开始积极设法解决这个问题，到五月底第一季度积压下来的工作已大部解决；今后我们还要作进一步的努力，使期刊发行工作做得更好。
    从一九五一年开始我局逐步接受某些北京版杂志的发行工作后，特别是今年接受了全部北京版杂志的发行工作后，我局期刊发行单位的人员配备、业务制度等方面都大大落后于客观需要；加上今年开始实行定期定额计划发行制度时很多杂志的定额数字少于读者的需要以及各种杂志的出版日期过于集中，期刊发行工作中就产生了严重的积压和混乱现象。而我们在处理具体工作时缺乏政治性、思想性和计划性，考虑问题不全面，更使问题不能及时解决。
    今年第二季度开始，发行处领导方面就亲自领导期刊科改进工作，发动群众清理了积压，改善了劳动组织，逐渐订立和加强了一些主要的业务制度（如订立并实施了复核制度和统计制度后，有效地减少了差错）。这不但大大改变了过去期刊发行工作中的混乱现象，并且给下半年的工作打下了良好的基础。
    我局发行处下半年的工作，以提高工作质量为总的努力方向。在第三季度，先着重在建立有关改善工作质量的制度、手续以及进一步调整劳动组织等方面；在第四季度则要求全面提高工作质量，制定质量指标以及贯彻第三季度所制订的制度。发行处已订出了下半年的工作计划及其实施要点，发动群众讨论和执行；并对今后加强处内的政治思想教育工作和发挥领导力量的问题订出了一些具体办法。
    报上发表的读者批评信，使我们更加牢牢记住过去工作中的教训，对我们改进今后期刊发行工作是有督促作用的。
