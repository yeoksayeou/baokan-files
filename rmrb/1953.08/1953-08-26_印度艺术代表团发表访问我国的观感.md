(Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 25th) The Indian Art Delegation organized by the All-India Peace Council issued the following statement to reporters before leaving China:

    The delegation, composed of Indian writers, musicians, singers, and dancers, spent more than five weeks in China, visiting many cities, factories, villages, nurseries, schools, cultural and art centers, and grand construction projects.

    Through performances and personal contacts, the delegation conveyed its message of goodwill, peace, and friendship to a large segment of the Chinese people.

    At train stations, in schools and nurseries, in the fields and factories, the delegation could see everywhere the goodwill and friendship of the people for India and the Indian people. Wherever we went, we received a very warm and friendly reception, and the mention of Indians evoked feelings of joy and affection. During every moment we spent in China, the Chinese people and their representatives treated and cared for us as their closest and dearest friends.

    Another thing that deeply moved us was the great peaceful transformation that this country is undergoing. Wherever we went, we could see astonishing changes, changes that can only be believed when seen with one's own eyes. Today, people have a new status in society, and the fate of China is in the hands of the people. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are carrying out a great peaceful construction work in an extremely united and orderly manner. After seeing all this, one cannot help but believe that in the near future, China will become one of the most progressive countries in the world in terms of culture, industry, and society.

    It is a very gratifying thing to see that art and culture occupy a very important place in the lives of the Chinese people. Many new music schools, dance schools, and other art schools have been established everywhere. Cultural activities occupy an important place in factories, villages, schools, and other organizations. Artists are also loved and cared for by the people and the state. They no longer have to worry about food and clothing while engaged in artistic work.

    During our stay in China, we tried our best to introduce the Chinese people to a glimpse of our rich and long-standing culture and art, as well as new creations in art. At the same time, we have also learned a lot from the Chinese people and their rich art and culture.

    Wherever we went, we brought the love of the Indian people for the Chinese people to the Chinese people. The response we received from the Chinese people showed that we have been very successful in conveying this message of goodwill and friendship.

    Our delegation left the shores of India with a message of peace and friendship for our fraternal Chinese people. This is the first such delegation. We hope that more such delegations will visit China in the future and further strengthen the ties of friendship.

    During our visit to China, we invited the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace to send a Chinese art delegation to our country. We hope that China will be able to send such a delegation in the near future, so that we may also have the opportunity to introduce our life and culture to them, and so that our people can also express their love for the Chinese people.

    印度艺术代表团发表访问我国的观感
    【新华社广州二十五日电】全印和平理事会组织的印度艺术代表团在离开中国前夕向记者发表声明如下：
    由印度作家、音乐家、歌唱家和舞蹈家组成的代表团在中国停留了五个多星期，参观了许多城市、工厂、村庄、托儿所、学校、文化艺术中心和宏大的建设工程。
    代表团通过演出和个人的接触，向一大部分中国人民传达了它的亲善、和平与友爱的信息。
    在火车站，在学校和托儿所，在田野和工厂，代表团到处可以看到人们对印度和印度人民的善意和友谊。无论我们到那里去，我们都受到非常热情而友爱的招待，一提到印度人，就会引起人们高兴和友爱的情绪。在我们在中国度过的每一个时刻，中国人民和他们的代表都把我们当做他们最亲密和挚爱的朋友看待和照顾。
    另外一件使我们极其感动的事情，就是这个国家正在经历的伟大的和平转变。我们无论到那里去，都可以看到惊人的变化，这些变化只有人们亲眼看到时才会相信。今天，人们在社会中有了新的地位，中国命运已掌握在老百姓手里了。在毛泽东主席的领导下，中国人民正在极其团结而有秩序地进行伟大的和平建设工作。在看到这一切以后，人们不能不相信，在不久的将来，中国在文化、工业和社会方面一定会成为世界上最进步的国家之一。
    看到艺术和文化在中国人民的生活里占有很重要的地位，这是一件令人非常高兴的事。各个地方都创办了许多新的音乐学校、舞蹈学校和其他艺术学校。文化活动在工厂、农村、学校和其他组织中占有重要的地位。艺术家们也受到了人民和国家的热爱和照顾。他们在从事艺术工作时，已不必再为衣食发愁。
    我们在留在中国的期间，曾尽力把我们丰富而悠久的文化和艺术以及艺术方面的新创造的一鳞一爪介绍给中国人民。同时，我们也从中国人民和他们丰富的艺术和文化中学到了很多东西。
    我们无论到什么地方，都把印度人民对中国人民的热爱带给了中国人民。我们从中国人民那里得到的反应表明，我们已经非常成功地传达了这种亲善和友爱的信息。
    我们代表团是带着给我们的兄弟般的中国人民的和平与友爱的信息离开印度海岸的。这样的代表团还是第一个。我们希望，将来有更多的这样的代表团来访问中国，并进一步地加强友谊的联系。
    在我们访问中国期间，我们曾邀请中国人民保卫世界和平委员会派遣一个中国艺术代表团到我国去。我们希望在不久的将来，中国能够派出这样一个代表团，好让我们也有机会把我们的生活和文化介绍给他们，并使我们的人民也可以表达他们对中国人民的热爱。
