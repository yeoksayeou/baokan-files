Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 8th. On the 6th of this month, the U.S. side, using the excuse of "POW demonstrations" in the Koje Island POW camp, massacred 12,000 POWs who were about to be repatriated, using rifles and poison gas, killing one POW and injuring four. According to the U.S. side's admission, they launched barbaric attacks on POWs in three camp areas in succession with fully armed troops for more than three hours. In fact, the POWs did not hold any "demonstrations"; they were merely singing in their huts to protest the U.S. side's atrocities.

People must ask: Why did the U.S. side massacre these POWs so viciously before they were to be repatriated? The Korean-Chinese side now has ample evidence to prove that this is a bloody conspiracy by the U.S. side to forcibly "screen" POWs with force on the eve of their repatriation, in an attempt to forcibly detain them. The massacre on Koje Island on August 6th was just one of them.

Recently, Li Haoxin, a repatriated Korean People's Army POW formerly held in the No. 1 POW camp on Koje Island, gave a detailed account of the U.S. side's use of force to forcibly detain our POWs once again.

Li Haoxin said that on the morning of July 28th, the day after the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, at 6:00 AM, Korean People's Army POWs in the No. 1 POW camp were driven to the square to assemble. U.S. armed guards immediately surrounded them. After they were examined from mouth to anus, a Rhee Syngman army officer said to them: "You will only face death if you return to North Korea. The only way to live is to serve the 'Republic of Korea' loyally. Those who want to stay, step forward!" But no one stepped forward.

That Rhee Syngman army officer shouted fiercely: "Step forward!" Still, no one moved an inch. On the contrary, people began to sing "The Song of General Kim Il-sung" with excitement.

At this time, the American soldiers on both sides fired pre-prepared poison gas bombs at them. In the dense poisonous smoke, someone bravely shouted: "Comrades, let us continue singing!" So, the faint singing started again. The enraged Americans continued to fire poison gas bombs. Korean People's Army POWs fell unconscious one after another. Li Haoxin said that before he fainted, he saw that more than sixty people near him had lost consciousness, one person had broken his leg, and three people were covered in sores and were carried out, their lives uncertain.

According to reports from repatriated Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs, on the same day, more than 600 Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs in the No. 12 camp area of the No. 8 POW camp on Jeju Island demanded that the U.S. side release our POWs who were detained by the U.S. side and should be repatriated, and guarantee their safety during repatriation. However, the U.S. side not only refused to release our POWs who were forcibly detained, but also fired nearly three hundred various poison gas bombs at them. More than two hundred people were poisoned and lost consciousness on the spot. Liu Hanjie, Wang Fuhai and more than sixty others were burned and suffered severe injuries all over their bodies.

The facts are very clear. This new massacre on August 6th is one of a series of atrocities by the U.S. side to intensify the forcible detention of POWs. It is worth noting that the U.S. side's bloody conspiracy is obviously going to continue. While announcing this massacre, the U.S. POW camp authorities openly declared: "It can be predicted that these demonstrations will continue to occur until the repatriation work is completed." This means that the U.S. side is prepared to continue to intensify the forcible detention of POWs by means of massacre under the false pretext of "POW demonstrations." People here are closely watching these actions of the U.S. side and believe that the U.S. side should bear full responsibility for this.

### 美方在遣俘的时候仍图强迫扣留战俘  巨济岛我方被俘人员又遭屠杀

    美方在遣俘的时候仍图强迫扣留战俘
    巨济岛我方被俘人员又遭屠杀
    【新华社开城八日电】本月六日美方在巨济岛战俘营内藉口“战俘示威”，用步枪和毒气对一万二千名即将遣返的战俘进行屠杀，打死战俘一名，打伤四名。据美方承认，他们在三个多小时内，用全副武装的军队，接连向三个营场中的战俘发动了野蛮进攻。而战俘们事实上并没有举行“示威”，他们只是在屋子里唱歌，抗议美方的暴行。
    人们要问：美方为什么在这些战俘将要被遣返之前，还要穷凶极恶地屠杀他们？朝中方面现在已有充分的人证，证明这是美方在遣返战俘的前夕，仍在用武力“甄别”战俘，企图强迫扣留他们的血腥阴谋。八月六日巨济岛上的屠杀事件，只不过是其中的一次。
    最近遣返的原在巨济岛第一战俘营的朝鲜人民军被俘人员李浩信详细地控诉了美方又一次用武力来强迫扣留我方被俘人员的经过。
    李浩信说，就在朝鲜停战协定签订的第二天——七月二十八日早晨六时，第一战俘营的营场里的朝鲜人民军被俘人员被赶到广场上集合。美方的武装卫兵立即围住了他们。当他们从嘴巴到肛门被检查过以后，一个李伪军军官对他们说：“你们要回北朝鲜去只有死路一条，要想活只有忠诚地为‘大韩民国’服务。愿留下的向前走一步！”可是没有一个人走出来。
    那个李伪军军官凶恶地喝道：“向前走！”仍然没有人移动一步。相反地，人们却激昂地唱起了“金日成将军之歌”。
    这时，两旁的美国兵便向他们打出了事先准备好的毒瓦斯弹。在浓密的毒烟中，有人勇敢地喊着：“同志们，让我们继续唱下去！”于是微弱的歌声又响起来。被激怒的美国人继续打出毒气弹。朝鲜人民军被俘人员一个个地昏倒了。李浩信说，他自己在昏迷以前，看到他附近已经有六十多人失去知觉，有一个人摔断了腿，有三个人混身糜烂，被抬了出去，生死不明。
    另据被遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员报告，同一天，在济州岛第八战俘营第十二号营场里的六百多个中国人民志愿军被俘人员，向美方要求释放被美方拘禁的应该遣返的我方被俘人员，并保证他们在被遣返途中的生命安全。但是，美方不但不释放被强迫扣留的我方被俘人员，而且竟向他们打了将近三百颗的各种毒瓦斯弹。当场有二百多人中毒后失去知觉。刘汉杰、王福海等六十多人被烧得遍体鳞伤。
    事实非常清楚，八月六日这一次新的屠杀事件，就是美方加紧用武力强迫扣留战俘的一连串的暴行之一。值得注意的是，美方的血腥阴谋显然还要继续下去。美方战俘营当局在宣布这一屠杀事件的同时，公然扬言：“可以预测这种示威将继续发生，直到遣返工作完毕为止。”这就是说，美方准备在“战俘示威”这个虚伪的藉口下，继续加紧用屠杀手段强迫扣留战俘。此间人士正密切注视美方的这些行动，并认为美方应对此负完全的责任。
