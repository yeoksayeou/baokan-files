Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th. Our special correspondent reports: For three days, starting from the 15th, the U.S. side has not repatriated a single Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war to our side at Panmunjom. According to the Associated Press, the United Nations Command claimed on the 12th that the repatriation of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war would be completed on the 13th. However, on the 14th, the U.S. side repatriated seven Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war to our side. These seven Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war were not included in the repatriation figures for the 14th that the U.S. side submitted on the 13th.

In fact, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war that the U.S. side should have repatriated to our side have not been completely repatriated by a long shot. According to reports from repatriated Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, at least two to three hundred Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who should have been directly repatriated are still being secretly detained by the U.S. side and have not been repatriated. The vast majority of them were captured and imprisoned by the U.S. side from prisoner-of-war camps around the time the armistice agreement was signed. On July 27th, the U.S. side, on the pretext of "names not matching, prisoner numbers unclear," successively seized 102 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who should have been directly repatriated from Prisoner of War Camp No. 8 on Jeju Island. Our side now possesses the complete list of these prisoners of war. On August 8th, the U.S. side again seized seven Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were to be directly repatriated from the Busan prisoner-of-war camp. According to reports from our captured personnel returning from the Busan U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, there are still thirty seriously wounded and seriously ill Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war being detained by the U.S. side in Busan and have not been repatriated.

Even the U.S. Secretary of the Army Stevens, the superior of the U.S. military command, admitted that the U.S. side has not yet completed the repatriation of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who should be directly repatriated. He told reporters in Washington on the 13th that the U.S. side was still holding 250 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. He said that, as far as he knew, not all Chinese prisoners of war who should have been repatriated had been repatriated. Even the Associated Press could not but admit that there was a "significant contradiction between the U.S. military command and Stevens on whether all eligible Chinese prisoners of war have been repatriated."

    据归来的志愿军被俘人员报告
    美方扣留被秘密拘禁的我志愿军被俘人员
    【新华社开城十七日电】本社特派记者报道：美方从十五日起，三天来在板门店没有遣送一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员给我方。据合众社报道，联合国军司令部在十二日曾声称：中国人民志愿军被俘人员将在十三日遣返完毕。但是在十四日，美方却又遣返给我方七名中国人民志愿军被俘人员。而在十三日美方交来的十四日遣返数字中，这七名中国人民志愿军被俘人员是没有列入在内的。
    事实上，美方应该遣返给我方的中国人民志愿军被俘人员远没有遣返完毕。根据遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的报告，至少有二、三百名应该直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员尚在美方秘密拘禁下没有被遣返回来，其中绝大部分是在停战协定签订前后被美方从战俘营抓走拘禁起来的。七月二十七日，美方就曾藉口“姓名不符，俘号不清”，从济州岛第八号战俘营内先后抓走一百零二名应该直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。我方现已握有这些战俘的全部名单。八月八日，美方又在釜山战俘营内抓走了七名直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。据从釜山美方战俘收容所归来的我方被俘人员报告：还有三十名重伤重病的中国人民志愿军被俘人员被美方扣留在釜山没有遣返。
    就是美军司令部的上司美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯，也承认美方还没有将直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员遣返完毕。他在十三日在华盛顿对记者说，美方还扣留有二百五十名中国人民志愿军被俘人员。他说，据他所知，并非所有应该遣返的中国战俘都已遣返。甚至美联社也不能不承认，在美军司令部和斯蒂文斯之间“对是否一切合格的中国战俘均已被遣返一节有着显著的矛盾”。
