Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 31st – The London "Workers' Daily" published an editorial on the 30th, criticizing the speech made by the US Secretary of State on the 28th.

The editorial said: "The United States is contemptuously pushing its allies aside, seemingly without a care. Apparently, Dulles, at his press conference, indicated that he considered Syngman Rhee more important than the rest of America's 'allies', and certainly more important than the United Nations.

"Dulles announced: Korea must be unified, Korea must be allied with the United States, and the United States must be allowed to station troops in Korea. He is not prepared to propose that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea, but is prepared to demand that Chinese troops withdraw, while allowing American troops to remain there. This is truly negotiation by ultimatum."

The editorial said: "It must be remembered that the terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement have only just begun to be implemented, not a single healthy prisoner has been exchanged, and all over the world, many families are waiting for their loved ones to return home from prisoner-of-war camps and the front lines. At this solemn moment, Dulles believes he can intimidate the Korean and Chinese side: if they do not accept all his ultimatums within ninety days of the opening of the political conference, he will relaunch the war. He did not consult with his allies, nor did he consult with the United Nations. He carelessly stated the basis he is prepared to use for negotiations. The British people's reaction to this matter will be very clear. They believe that: Britain must participate in the negotiations; the United Nations must participate in the negotiations; the Americans must end their monopoly on the negotiations and there must be genuine negotiations, not hysterical ultimatums."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 2nd – The British Association of Scientific Workers, including many prominent scientists, recently issued a statement welcoming the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement and calling for the implementation of "the principle of negotiations without preconditions or limitations on the agenda."

    伦敦“工人日报”发表社论反对美国垄断谈判
    严正谴责杜勒斯企图重新发动战争的叫嚣
    【新华社柏林三十一日电】伦敦“工人日报”三十日发表社论，斥责美国国务卿在二十八日发表的谈话。
    社论说：“美国正在轻蔑地把它的盟国推在一旁，好像毫不在意似的。显然地，杜勒斯在记者招待会上表示，他认为李承晚比其余的美国‘盟友’更加重要，确乎比联合国还重要。
    “杜勒斯宣布：朝鲜必须统一，朝鲜必须和美国结盟，必须允许美国在朝鲜驻军。他不准备提议一切外国军队都撤出朝鲜，却准备要求中国军队撤退，而让美国军队留在那里。这真正是以最后通牒的方式进行谈判。”
    社论说：“必须记着：朝鲜停战协定条款才开始实施，还没有交换一个健康的俘虏，在世界各地，许多家庭都正等待他们的亲人从俘虏营和前线回家。在这个庄严的时刻，杜勒斯认为他可以恐吓朝中方面：如果它们在政治会议开幕后九十天之内不接受他的全部最后通牒，他就要重新发动战争。他没有和他的盟国商量，也没有和联合国商量，他满不在乎地表明他准备用来进行谈判的基础。英国人民对这件事情的反应将是十分清楚的，他们认为：英国必须参加谈判；联合国必须参加谈判；美国人必须终止对谈判的垄断，必须有真正的谈判而不是歇斯底里的最后通牒。”
    【新华社柏林二日电】包括许多著名科学家在内的英国科学界争取和平协会日前发表声明，欢迎朝鲜停战协定的签订，并要求实现“不得事先规定条件和议程没有限制的谈判原则。”
