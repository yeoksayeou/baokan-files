    I am a middle school teacher, and I live with children every day. I would like to talk about some issues concerning guiding children in reading literary books, based on my own experience.

    Children lack knowledge and experience, and they do not have the ability to choose books. Therefore, teachers have a significant responsibility in distinguishing good from bad and differentiating between easy and difficult works. Children respect teachers. We often hear children say, when arguing with each other or with adults, "The teacher said!" They treat the teacher's words as a guide for their actions.

    Unfortunately, some teachers do not pay attention to the work of guiding students in reading literary books. They do not realize that children's literature is a powerful educational tool for young people. Some teachers rarely read any literary works themselves in a year. They think that children's literature is "for kids, and it's a waste of time for adults." In this way, they cannot know what books children should actually read. When children ask them to recommend books, they can only respond with these words: "Anything that says 'children's reading material' on the cover is okay to read." When children ask them which books are good and which are bad, they can only answer: "Anything bought from Xinhua Bookstore is fine!"

    It is precisely because we have abandoned the work of guiding children's reading that the following phenomena have occurred. Some children, seeing that the teacher doesn't care, simply stop reading. Those who want to read are left to choose for themselves. Their "standards" for choosing books probably boil down to these: whether the title sounds good, whether the cover looks good, whether there are many illustrations, whether it's lively, and whether there's fighting. Some children, regardless of what kind of book it is, pick it up and read it. Often, they are negatively influenced because they read inappropriate books.

    Many children are afraid to walk at night, afraid of ghosts, and have to ask someone to accompany them when they go out to relieve themselves. Some children speak wildly and make very base hooligan gestures. We have been researching these issues for a long time, but we never thought that we would find the answer in children's literary reading materials.

    For example, we have painstakingly educated children to become brave, strong, and resolute active builders of communism in the future. In this work, year after year, we don't know how much effort we have put in to give children some correct understanding and some progress. However, one child, after reading an article called "Fairy Lotus in the Demon Kingdom" (written by He Gongchao) in a book called "Chronicles of the Beast Kingdom," said to me: "The night I finished reading this book, I dared to sleep only with my head covered. I'm still scared when I think about it now. As soon as it gets dark, I don't dare to go out and play." Obviously, this article offset our long-term education.

    This is just one example. However, the poison spread by books like this is unknown how wide, the number of children affected is unknown how many, and the amount of time and effort teachers have to spend in the classroom to eliminate these toxins is unknown!

    "Children's books are written for education" (Belinsky). As a teacher, I hope that children's literature writers can think about what they are preparing to educate children before they write. Is this education correct?

    There are also some teachers who introduce many books to children, but they do not consider the children's age and interests. They introduce all the famous works they have heard of and seen to their students. I once asked dozens of children in more than a dozen Beijing municipal elementary schools which literary books they had read. Many of them mentioned "The Hurricane" and "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River," saying that "the teacher introduced them." These books are relatively thick and deep, and elementary school students cannot understand them. This violates the principle of "appropriate level" in education. Asking them to read difficult things too early will not only fail to cultivate their habit of reading literary books but will also dilute their interest in reading. One sixth-grade elementary school student borrowed a copy of "A Diary Found in Sunchon" with great effort. After reading two or three pages, he said to me: "Everyone says this book is good, but I don't understand it at all after reading two or three pages. It's boring."

    It is a fact that there are not many good children's literary works. Since there are few good works, we should not miss a single one. Good children's literary works have a very significant educational effect on children. After reading Zhang Tianyi's "The Story of Luo Wenyin," many children asked me: "Which school does Luo Wenyin go to? How come the problems he has are the same as mine? When I read this book, I thought it was talking about me!" Many children firmly remembered an important sentence in the book, "I hope you can control yourself," and often use it to check themselves and encourage others. These children's words made me deeply realize that the influence of "The Story of Luo Wenyin" on children's ideological quality is far more profound than what a teacher can do.

    Teachers should responsibly recommend works like this to students. We should not only passively restrict children from reading this or that; we should actively introduce good books to children and replace bad books with good books! When children have good books to read regularly, we no longer have to worry about them spending money to rent bad books from bookstalls.

    I have encountered several children who were fascinated by martial arts novels. They read them day and night, even secretly looking at them during class. As a result, they fell behind in their studies, their minds were filled with bizarre ideas, they were no longer willing to study, they hated school regulations, they felt that the teacher restricted their "freedom" and "development," and they fantasized about becoming a heroic figure who could "dart through houses, leap over roofs, and walk on walls." After discovering such students, I would talk to them individually, tell them about the influence of reading bad books, and introduce them to some good books. As a result, they stopped reading bad books, but they also stopped reading good books. They said: "I'm used to reading martial arts novels, and reading this is not exciting enough." Indeed, some children's literary works are really boring and lack beautiful appeal. "Children's literature should be both serious and interesting" (Simonov) in order to capture young readers. I hope that children's literature writers can pay attention to this. However, teachers should also carefully study whether it is really boring, or whether they are not used to reading such books. When I encounter such situations, I help them analyze and study the content and techniques of the books so that they can understand and accept them. Over time, they gradually became interested in progressive books, and they also established a deep relationship with me. They no longer hated school and were able to study with peace of mind. Of course, doing so takes a lot of time and requires meticulousness and patience, but it is worth doing.

    I also pay attention to book reviews in newspapers and magazines at all times. The Chinese Young Pioneers, the Central People's Broadcasting Station, and the Chinese Middle School Students Magazine have all done this work, and these introductions have brought a lot of convenience to my work of selecting books. However, I have to say that there are indeed too few introductions to children's literary books in newspapers and magazines.

    Children do not like to read translated works very much, because they find it difficult to remember foreign names. They say: "Why are foreign names so long? One person's name is enough for three or four of us Chinese people." They also dislike that the living habits of foreigners are not in line with ours. Teachers should also explain these truths to children. Books like "Walden," "In the Arctic," "First Grader," and "Malayev at School and at Home" are all worth asking children to read. Here, I would like to mention in passing that the phenomenon of difficult, obscure, and lengthy words and sentences is very common in translated works of children's literature, and there are even grammatically incorrect places, which seriously affect students' reading and writing. I hope that comrades who are engaged in translating children's literary works can pay more attention to these aspects.

    Some teachers say: "The school has little funding and cannot buy many books." I feel that: precisely because "the school has little funding and cannot buy many books," we should pay more attention to selecting books and spend the money where it is most useful. Recently, I went to visit several elementary schools, and I found that some of the books in their book catalog were of a deeper content and a very high price. I don't know why the person in charge of managing the books was willing to spend very little funding to buy some books that were not suitable for children to read. The price of one such book can buy several books suitable for children to read! At the same time, each school should preferably list a reading list according to the grade level and the depth of the books. This is especially true for schools with relatively few books. This will give children more opportunities to read the books they should read and prevent the bias of "lower grades borrowing what they don't understand, and higher grades having no books to read."

    In the process of guiding children to read literary books, I have increasingly deeply felt that: good literary reading materials can broaden children's horizons and help teachers to more quickly cultivate students into builders of socialism-communism; bad books, however, create confusion in students' thinking and reduce or even offset the effects of school education. Guiding children's reading is the responsibility of every teacher. Can it be ignored?

    教师应该指导学生阅读文艺书籍
    赵镇南
    我是一个中学教师，我整天跟孩子们生活在一起，我想就我自己的体验，谈谈关于指导孩子们阅读文艺书籍的一些问题。
    孩子们的知识和经验都不丰富，他们没有选择书籍的能力；因此，在鉴别好坏、分清难易等工作上，教师的责任是重大的。孩子们是尊敬教师的。我们经常可以听到孩子们自己或者和成年人争辩问题时，常常说的一句话：“老师说的！”他们是把教师的话当做行动的指针的。
    遗憾的是：有些教师并没有重视指导学生们阅读文艺书籍这件工作，他们没有认识到儿童文学是少年儿童们的有力的教育工具。有的教师自己一年都难得看上几本文艺作品，他们认为儿童文学作品是给“小孩子们看的，成年人看了是白费时间”，这样他们就不可能知道孩子们究竟应该看些什么书。孩子们请他介绍书籍，他就只能用这些话来应付：“书皮上写着‘儿童读物’的，都能看。”孩子们请他告诉哪些书好，哪些书坏；他就只能这样回答：“凡是从新华书店买来的，都没错！”
    正是由于我们放弃了指导孩子们阅读的工作，才产生了下面这些现象。有的孩子见老师不管了，自己也就不看了；想看的，就只好自己去选择。他们选择书籍的“标准”，大概不外乎这几项：书名好听不好听、书皮好看不好看、插图多不多、热闹不热闹、有打仗的没有。还有一些孩子，不管什么书，拿起来就看。往往因为他们看的书不适当，受到坏的影响。
    有不少孩子晚上不敢走路，怕鬼，出去解手还得叫人跟着作伴；有的孩子满嘴说着野里野气的话，还做着非常低级的流氓动作。我们很久以前就在研究这些问题，却没有想到从儿童文艺读物中，竟会找到答案。
    譬如说：我们曾辛辛苦苦地教育孩子们，使他们将来成为刚毅、勇敢、坚强的共产主义的积极的建设者；在这一件工作上，年复一年，我们不知道下了多大功夫，才使孩子们有了一些正确的认识，有了一些进步；可是，有一个孩子看过一本叫“兽国记”（何公超著）中“仙国妖莲”这篇文章以后，对我说：“刚看完这本书那天晚上，蒙着头才敢睡觉，现在想起来还害怕。天一黑，我就不敢出去玩啦。”很明显，这篇文章抵消了我们长时期的教育。
    这只是一个例子。可是，像这一类的书籍散布的毒素，不知道有多么广，不知道受害的儿童有多么多，不知道要教师们在课堂上花费多少时间和心血，才能把这些毒素肃清！
    “儿童书籍是为了教育而写”（别林斯基），作为一个教师，我希望儿童文艺作家们在执笔之前，能够想一想自己这篇文章准备教育儿童一些什么？这个教育是不是正确？
    也有一些教师，他们倒是给孩子们介绍了不少书籍，但他们并没有考虑到儿童的年龄和兴趣。他们把自己听说的和看到的名著，一股脑儿介绍给学生。我曾经问过十几个北京市立小学里的几十个小朋友，他们看过哪些文艺书籍。他们告诉给我的书目中，不少人都有“暴风骤雨”“太阳照在桑乾河上”这几本书，他们说是“老师介绍的”。这几本书都比较厚，比较深，小学生是不可能看得懂的，这也就违背了教育学上的“量力性”的原则；过早地叫他们阅读艰深的东西，不但不能培养起他们阅读文艺书籍的习惯，反而会冲淡他们阅读的兴趣。有一个小学六年级的小朋友，他费了很大的劲儿，借了一本“在顺川发现的一本日记”。看了两三页以后，他跟我说：“都说这本书好，我看了两三页，怎么一点儿也不懂？把我都给看腻味了。”
    好的儿童文艺作品不多，这是事实。好的作品既然少，我们就更不应该放过一本。好的儿童文艺作品对儿童的教育作用是非常大的。有好些个孩子读了张天翼著的“罗文应的故事”这本书以后，向我打听：“罗文应在哪个学校上学？怎么他犯的毛病跟我一样？我看这本书的时候，只当是说我哪！”有不少的孩子，把书中很重要的一句话“希望你自己管得住自己”牢牢地记住，常常用来检查自己、鼓励别人。这些孩子们的话，使我更深切地体会到“罗文应的故事”在孩子们思想品质上的影响，已远比一个教师所做到的更深刻了。
    像这样的作品，教师们应该认真负责地向学生推荐。我们不应该只是消极地限制孩子们不要读这个，不要读那个；我们应该积极地向孩子们介绍好书，用好书来代替坏书！当孩子们经常有好书读的时候，我们便用不着再担心他们花钱向书摊上租赁坏书了。
    我曾遇到过好几个这样的孩子：他们被武侠小说迷住了。他们废寝忘食地看，甚至有时上正课还偷着瞧。结果，他们在学习上掉了队，脑子里装满了离奇古怪的想法，不再安心学习，讨厌学校的制度，嫌老师限制了他们的“自由”和“发展”，幻想着作一个“窜房越脊，飞檐走壁”式的英雄人物。当我发现这样的学生以后，我就找他们个别谈话，告诉他们看坏书的影响，并且给他们介绍了一些好的书籍。这样一来，坏书他们是不看了，可是好书他们也不看，他们说：“看武侠小说看惯了，看这个不过瘾。”的确，有些儿童文学作品确实是枯燥无味，没有优美的吸引力。“儿童文学应当是又严肃又有兴味”（西蒙诺夫），才能抓住幼小的读者。希望儿童文艺作家们能注意到这一点。不过教师们也应该仔细地研究一下，是不是真正的枯燥无味，或者是他们不习惯读这样的书籍。我碰到这样的情形，就帮助他们分析、研究书籍的内容和技巧，使他们能够了解、接受。日子长了，他们慢慢地都对进步的书籍，发生了兴趣；和我也建立了深厚的感情，他们不再讨厌学校了，也能安心学习了。当然，这样做需要花费不少时间，而且还需要细致、耐心；但这样做是值得的。
    我也时刻注意报纸杂志上的书刊介绍。中国少年报、中央人民广播电台、中学生杂志社都做过这项工作，这些介绍的文字，给我选择书籍的工作，带来不少方便。但是，我不得不说，报刊杂志上对儿童文艺书籍的介绍，确实是太少了。
    孩子们不大喜欢读翻译的作品，嫌外国人名不好记。他们说：“外国人的名字怎么起得那么长，一个人的名字够咱们中国三四个人使唤的。”还嫌外国人的生活习惯跟咱们中国不对劲儿。教师们也应该向孩子们说明这些道理。像“林中生活”“在北极”“一年级小学生”“马列耶夫在学校和家里”这些书，都值得叫孩子们去阅读。这里，我想附带提一提，在儿童文学的翻译作品中，词句艰深、生涩、冗长的现象很普遍，甚至还有语法不通的地方，影响学生的阅读和写作很严重；希望从事翻译儿童文艺作品的同志，能在这些方面多加注意。
    有些教师说：“学校经费少，买不了什么书。”我觉得：正因为“学校经费少，买不了什么书”，才更应该注意选择书，要把钱花在最有用的地方，才合适。最近我到几个小学去参观，我发现他们的图书目录中有一部分书的内容较深，价钱也很高，不知道负责管理图书的先生为什么竟肯把极少的经费，买来一些不适于儿童阅读的书籍。像这样的书，一本的价钱，就可以买到适合孩子们看的书好几本！同时，每一个学校最好按照年级和书籍的深浅，列出一张阅读书目。特别是书籍比较少的学校，更可以这样做。这样就使孩子们有更多的机会读到应该看的书籍，也防止了“低年级借了看不懂，高年级没书看”的偏向。
    在指导儿童阅读文艺书籍的过程中，我日益深切地感觉到：良好的文艺读物可以开扩孩子们的眼界，帮助教师把学生更迅速地培养成社会主义——共产主义的建设者；坏的书籍却造成学生思想上的混乱，降低甚至抵消了学校教育的效果。指导孩子们的阅读工作，是每个教师的职责，难道是可以忽视的么？
