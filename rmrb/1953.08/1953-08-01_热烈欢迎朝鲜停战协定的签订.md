    Warmly Welcome the Signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement
    Polish People
    The Polish people greet the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement with great joy. Rallies have been held in mines, metallurgical plants, manufacturing factories, and government offices, where workers have emphasized that the signing of the armistice agreement is a great victory for the forces of world peace.
    At a rally at the Ursus Machine Factory near Warsaw, shock worker Zvierzchovska said: "The fact that there is a Korean armistice shows that no international problem cannot be resolved through negotiation. It once again shows us what a great force the will of the people of the world is, and how wise the peace policy of the Soviet Union and the peace camp is."
    The staff of the City Planning and Design Bureau held a rally, where they spoke enthusiastically about their joy that their friends in distant Korea can now begin rebuilding their war-torn homeland. The attendees passed a letter to the Korean people amidst applause. The letter reads: "We are the engineers, technicians, draftsmen, and workers of the department responsible for planning the reconstruction of the heroic capital, Warsaw. We fully understand the magnitude of your task in building a new and more beautiful Korea. We are convinced that the will to victory that inspired you to fight during those very difficult times will now lead you to new victories in the peaceful construction of your homeland."
    Miners held meetings to celebrate after hearing the news of the Korean armistice. The miners of the Gottwald Coal Mine passed a telegram to the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Warsaw at a mass rally. The telegram said: "We warmly congratulate the entire Korean people and cheer for the great victory they have achieved in the cause of defending peace. We clearly understand that from the moment the armistice agreement is signed, the task facing peace-loving people is to consolidate the victory won by the people of all countries in the struggle for freedom and independence."
    Many other cities in Poland also held similar mass rallies.
    Burmese Circles
    All circles in Burma welcome the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    The Burmese Workers and Peasants Party, the All-Burma Trade Union Congress, the All-Burma Peasants' Union, the Burmese People's Youth League, and the Burmese Women's Association jointly issued a statement on this matter, congratulating the Korean and Chinese people. The statement pointed out that the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a victory for the Korean and Chinese people, and also a victory for all peace-loving people in the world. The statement believes that people must remain vigilant against new war conspiracies by warmongers. Wu Wangdan, chairman of the People's Peace Front, said that the Korean armistice is of great benefit to world peace, and also of great benefit to the Burmese people. Ba Maw, honorary chairman of the Greater Burma Party, said that the Korean armistice is a major victory for the cause of world peace. On July 28th, all major newspapers in Rangoon published the news of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement in prominent positions.
    German Communist Party "Freies Volk"
    The German Communist Party's organ "Freies Volk" published an editorial on the 27th entitled "The People Have Won," commenting on the Korean armistice:
    "What millions upon millions of people around the world have eagerly awaited has finally come true. American aggression has been repelled. For the first time in history, the United States has suffered defeat in a war. The Korean people have won. This shows that people who fight for freedom and national independence are invincible."
    The editorial said: "A long and arduous road has been traveled since the Syngman Rhee clique, incited by Dulles, launched an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It has been two years since Soviet representative Malik proposed holding armistice talks. The Americans have done everything they can to sabotage the negotiations. However, the patience and determination of the Korean and Chinese side proved even stronger. The constant provocations of the American negotiators resulted in this: they exposed their true colors of wanting war and not peace in front of the peace-loving people of the world. America's puppets have continuously created heavy obstacles. World public opinion is still angry and despising of the provocative actions of this South Korean Adenauer."
    The editorial concluded: "What lessons can the Germans learn from the Korean event? That is: negotiations, no matter how long they take, are ultimately better than hot or cold war."
    French Newspapers
    French newspapers welcomed the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Pierre Cotard wrote in "L'Humanité": "The whole world will welcome the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement with immense joy..." Cotard emphasized that the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement signifies a great victory for the Korean and Chinese people and all those who have steadfastly opposed the Korean War. He continued, "However, not all problems have been resolved. The fact that long negotiations were necessary is enough to show that the aggressors only reluctantly agreed to stop fighting at the end. For two years they created many difficulties, using various excuses to stop the negotiations, each time demanding more and conceding less, attempting in this way to frustrate the peace-loving side." The author finally exposed Syngman Rhee's provocative conspiracies and called on people to heighten their vigilance in the cause of defending peace.
    "Libération" wrote: "As a result, no provocation has been able to destroy the will of the Chinese and Korean people to strive for peace. The struggle waged in countries around the world to achieve negotiations and a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict has finally triumphed over the conspiracies of those who have tried to prolong the conflict for more than two years." But on the other hand, the newspaper emphasized that the conspiracies of the enemies of peace have not ended, and that the people who have achieved their first great victory should continue to fight to make the armistice a complete peace.
    "Combat" wrote: "Opinion forced the cessation of military operations. Washington abandoned its ideological 'crusade' (which it only considers worth doing when it is carried out by its allies) before beginning negotiations with the Chinese and North Korean Communists."

    热烈欢迎朝鲜停战协定的签订
    波兰人民
    波兰人民以十分高兴的心情迎接朝鲜停战协定的签订。矿山、冶金工厂、制造工厂和机关中纷纷举行集会，劳动人民在会上着重指出停战协定的签字是世界和平力量的伟大胜利。
    在华沙附近的乌尔苏斯机器工厂的集会上，突击工人兹维尔兹霍夫斯加说：“朝鲜停战这一事实说明没有任何国际问题是不能用协商办法解决的，它再一次向我们指出世界人民的意志是多么巨大的力量，苏联与和平阵营的和平政策是多么英明。”
    城市计划设计局的工作人员举行集会，他们热烈地谈到了他们对远在朝鲜的朋友今天能够开始重建饱受创伤的祖国而感到的欢欣。到会者在掌声中通过了给朝鲜人民的一封信，信中写道：“我们是为重建英勇首都华沙制订计划的部门的工程师、技师、制图员和工人，我们非常了解你们在建设一个新的更美丽的朝鲜中任务的巨大。我们深信，在那些非常困难的时刻中鼓舞你们作战的对胜利的意志，现在将领导你们在你们祖国的和平建设事业中取得新的胜利。”
    矿工们在听到朝鲜停战的消息后，都纷纷开会庆祝。哥特瓦尔德煤矿的矿工们在群众大会上通过一个致朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻华沙大使馆的电文。电文说：“我们热烈地祝贺全体朝鲜人民并为他们在保卫和平事业中取得的伟大胜利而欢呼。我们清楚地了解，从停战协定签字的时刻起，爱好和平的人民已面临的任务是：巩固各国人民在争取自由和独立的斗争中所取得的胜利。”
    波兰许多其他的城市也举行了同样的群众大会。
    缅甸各界
    缅甸各界欢迎朝鲜停战协定的签订。
    缅甸工农党、全缅工会大会、全缅农民联合会、缅甸人民青年联盟、缅甸妇女协会就此事联合发表声明，向朝中人民表示祝贺。声明指出：朝鲜停战协定的签订是朝中人民的胜利，也是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利。声明认为：人们仍须警惕好战分子的新的战争阴谋。人民和平阵线主席吴旺丹说：朝鲜停战对世界和平有极大好处，同样，对缅甸人民也有很大好处。大缅甸党名誉主席巴茂说：朝鲜停战是世界和平事业的重大胜利。仰光各大报于七月二十八日都以显著地位刊载了朝鲜停战协定签订的消息。
    德国共产党“自由人民报”
    德国共产党机关报“自由人民报”二十七日发表题为“人民取得了胜利”的社论，评朝鲜停战说：
    “全世界千千万万人民急切期待着的事情终于实现了。美国的侵略被打退了。美国在历史上第一次在战争中遭到了失败。朝鲜人民取得了胜利。这件事说明，为自由和民族独立而战的人民是不可战胜的。”
    社论说：“自从李承晚集团在杜勒斯策动下对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动攻击以来，人们经历了一段漫长而艰苦的道路。苏联代表马立克提出举行停战谈判的建议以后，已有两年了。美国人竭尽了一切力量来破坏谈判。但是，朝中方面的耐心和坚定来得更有力量。美国谈判代表的处处挑衅得到了这样一个结果：他们在全世界爱好和平的人民面前暴露出了他们要战争不要和平的真面目。美国的傀儡接连地制造了重重的障碍。全世界的舆论至今仍然对这个南朝鲜的阿登纳的挑衅行动感到愤怒和鄙视。”
    社论最后说：“德国人从朝鲜事件可以得到什么教训呢？这就是：谈判不管费多久时间，到底总胜过热战或冷战。”
    法国各报
    法国各报对朝鲜停战协定的签字表示欢迎。皮埃尔·古达德在“人道报”上写道：“全世界都将万分高兴地欢迎朝鲜停战协定的签字……”古达德强调指出，朝鲜停战协定的签订，意味着朝中人民和一切坚持不渝地反对朝鲜战争的人民的巨大胜利。他接着写道：“可是，并非一切问题都已解决。长期谈判的事实已足够说明，侵略者是在最后才勉强同意停止战斗的。两年来他们制造了许多困难，以种种藉口来停止谈判，他们每一次都是要求越来越多、而让步越来越少，企图这样来挫折爱好和平的一方。”作者在最后揭露了李承晚的挑衅阴谋，并且号召人们在保卫和平的事业中要提高警惕。
    “解放报”写道：“结果是任何挑拨都没有能摧毁中朝人民争取和平的意志。在世界各国中展开的、为争取谈判与和平解决朝鲜冲突而进行的斗争，终于战胜了两年多来竭力拖延冲突的那些人的阴谋诡计。”但在另一方面，该报着重指出，和平敌人的阴谋还没有终止，已经取得了第一个巨大胜利的人民应当继续为使停战成为彻底的和平而斗争。
    “战斗报”写道：“舆论迫使军事行动停止。华盛顿抛弃了它思想上的‘十字军远征’（它只在由它的同盟者来进行这种‘十字军远征’时，才认为这是值得一干的）之后，才开始与中国和北朝鲜的共产党进行谈判。”
