Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 11th: The Hong Kong English-language "South China Morning Post" published two dispatches from Korea on the 8th, reporting on the conversations of Keel, a released POW formerly of the British Army's Gloucestershire Regiment, and two released Australian POWs. When interviewed by British and American journalists, they all praised the humanitarian treatment they received from the Korean and Chinese side. All three POWs mentioned that they had attempted to escape in the early stages of their captivity, but even so, the humanitarian treatment they received from the Korean and Chinese side did not change.

British POW Keel said that at one point, he had some problems with his leg and "couldn't walk very well." He said that later, "I went to a hospital in Bi Tong, and they healed me."

The names of the two Australian POWs are Donald Booker and Robert Packer. The dispatch quoted them as saying that the Korean and Chinese side "didn't give them much work to do, and they spent most of their time on sports. They held volleyball and softball games between companies. They swam in the Yalu River in the summer, and they skated in the winter."

The Hong Kong "Te Chen Western Post" also published a similar dispatch on the 6th, which said: "It is impossible to see that the treatment received by the British prisoners was not as good as they said."

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 10th: Our correspondent Wu Min reports: Just as American and British POWs were leaving our POW camps in batches for repatriation with grateful hearts, the American propaganda organs, in order to achieve their ulterior motives, were increasingly brazenly using various fanciful methods, trying their best to open the market for their fabricated lies about our so-called "abuse" of POWs.

Because the repatriated British POWs have continuously revealed the truth about our side's treatment of POWs in the spirit of humanitarianism since the exchange of POWs, the American propaganda organs' talk of "barbaric abuse" has gone bankrupt. American news agencies have recently deliberately spread rumors saying that American and British POWs received "different" treatment in our POW camps. For example, the Associated Press specifically cited the opinions of two repatriated American POWs it had collected on the 7th, saying that in the same POW camp, "the British received better treatment than the Americans."

However, the United Press's attempt to deliberately exaggerate the idea that the treatment of American POWs was more "unfortunate" than that of British POWs was overturned on the same day by a statement from a group of repatriated British POWs. They "insisted to Associated Press reporters that prisoners of war, regardless of nationality, were treated equally." Kyle, a soldier of the Gloucestershire Regiment, said that although Commonwealth soldiers, American white soldiers, American black soldiers, Turkish soldiers, and other United Nations forces were housed separately, "everyone received the same amount of food, soap, tobacco—in fact, all the rations were the same." Royal Marine Corps member Dalchin, who was captured in 1951 and belonged to the 1st Marine Division of the United States Marine Corps, said definitively: "We received the same treatment, exactly the same." When these soldiers talked about the pleasant lives of POWs of various countries under our lenient policy, they said, "All the prisoners mingled together during sports activities, worship, camp concerts, or other less formal occasions."

The United Press, which is more enthusiastic about spreading rumors and distorting the truth than reporting facts, brought out another fresh topic after one lie after another ran into a wall, saying that the Korean and Chinese medical personnel "conducted large-scale medical experiments on American POWs." For example, someone said, "In the hospital, they saw them cut open the ribs of fifteen Americans and put a small piece of meat under the skin." However, the United Press reporter himself had to reluctantly add a note to this operation of tissue therapy, which has long been widely used in the advanced medical community, saying: "It is believed that this is a new medical method of Soviet skin grafting." Another example mentioned by the United Press in a vicious tone was: some POWs "died shortly after" being injected. The soldier Morse, who reported this, said, "He didn't know what disease these POWs had." Naturally, for this reporter, he didn't need to inquire about the condition at all; his task was completed.

However, the misfortune of the American hired rumor-mongers is that they cannot cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand. The humanitarian and noble qualities, superb skills, and medical efficiency of the Korean and Chinese medical personnel were even acknowledged by Major Heatherington, the chief medical officer of the Royal Canadian Medical Corps of the British Brigade, who was responsible for examining the physical condition of the repatriated POWs in Munsan. He told Reuters reporters on the 8th that, as far as he knew, Chinese doctors took good care of their POWs, and "their efficiency seemed very high." He said: "I have just seen a person whose tonsils were removed with a surgical scalpel, without the use of formal surgical instruments except for the scalpel, and the operation was done very well." He said that appendectomy was also "satisfactory." Thanks to sufficient nutrition and thorough medical care, "not a single Commonwealth soldier has been found to have tuberculosis or other lung diseases." And "the nutrition experts attached to the camp who specialize in taking care of malnourished patients have no work to do." Another officer in the camp said: The returning POWs "mostly look healthier than the soldiers here." In fact, not only British POWs, but also all American POWs and other POWs, received the same humanitarian treatment. American POW Eugene Rush once wrote based on his personal experience in the Bi Tong POW camp hospital: "The doctors and nurses did everything they could to help patients recover quickly and make their lives in the hospital very good. My feeling towards those doctors and nurses is: they are simply like brothers and sisters to me."

So far, even the American propaganda organs themselves feel that the effect of rumors and slanders is not satisfactory. Therefore, they are trying their best to further spread colorful lies from various new "angles." It is worth noting that the United Press New York headquarters sent its reporter Wilmiren an instruction on the 9th, asking him to "report" the "abuse" of POWs "from the perspective of Puerto Rican soldiers." This instruction reminded him "not to forget to use certain things" to show that Puerto Rican soldiers who were with American POWs in POW camps were "abused" to death and "to show (their) resistance to communist propaganda," and instructed that news from anywhere would do.

It can be seen that American news agencies are running at full speed to fabricate malicious and provocative slanders. World opinion must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the political conspiracies hidden behind these rumors.

### 美方宣传机关恶意制造我方“虐待”战俘的谎言接连破产  英美澳籍被释战俘称道朝中方面人道待遇

    美方宣传机关恶意制造我方“虐待”战俘的谎言接连破产
    英美澳籍被释战俘称道朝中方面人道待遇
    【新华社广州十一日电】香港英文“南华早报”八日刊登该报朝鲜专讯两则，报道原属英军格罗斯特团的被释战俘基尔和两个被释的澳大利亚战俘的谈话，他们在被英、美记者访问时，都称道朝中方面给他们的人道待遇。这三个战俘都谈到他们曾在被俘初期脱逃过，即使这样，朝中方面对他们的人道待遇并没有改变。
    英国战俘基尔说，有一个时候，他的腿有些毛病，“不能很好地行走”。他说，后来“我到了碧潼的医院，他们替我医好了。”
    两个澳大利亚战俘的姓名是唐纳·布克和波伯·帕克尔。专讯引述他们的话说：朝中方面“没有给他们多做工作，他们的绝大部分时间是花在运动上，他们连与连之间进行了排球和垒球比赛，他们夏季在鸭绿江上游泳，冬天他们滑冰”。
    香港“德臣西报”六日也曾登载一篇类似的专讯，专讯说：“完全看不出英俘所受的待遇没有他们所讲的那么好”。
    【新华社开城十日电】本社记者吴敏报道：正当美英战俘怀着感激的心情离开我方战俘营被分批遣返的时候，美国宣传机关为了达到其不可告人的目的，越来越放肆地用各种异想天开的方法，竭力打算替它们捏造出来的所谓我方“虐待”战俘的谎话打开市场。
    由于交换战俘以来被遣返的英国战俘曾经不断透露出我方以人道主义精神对待战俘的真相，使得美国宣传机关的关于“野蛮虐待”之类的鬼话遭到破产，美国通讯社最近又故意散布空气说：美英战俘在我方战俘营中受到“不同”的待遇。例如，合众社七日特别引用了它所搜罗到的两个被遣返的美国战俘的意见说，在同一战俘营中，“英国人得到的待遇比美国人要好”。
    但是，合众社企图加意渲染的美国战俘的待遇比英国战俘来得“不幸”的说法，就在同一天之内，就被一群被遣返回去的英国战俘的声明所推翻了。他们向美联社记者“坚持说，俘虏们不分国籍，一律受到平等的待遇”。格罗斯特团的士兵凯尔说，虽然英联邦士兵、美国白人士兵、美国黑人士兵、土耳其士兵和其他联合国军队是分开住的，“但是每一个人都领到同样数量的食物、肥皂、烟草——事实上，所有的配给物品都是一样。”皇家海军陆战队队员达尔钦在一九五一年被俘时是属于美国海军陆战队第一师的，他肯定地说：“我们得到同样的待遇，完全一样”。这些士兵谈到在我方的宽待政策下各国战俘的愉快生活时表示，“在进行体育活动、做礼拜、开营场音乐会的时候或其他不太正式的场合，所有的俘虏都混杂在一起”。
    热心于造谣和歪曲真相远过于报道事实的合众社，在一个接一个的谎话碰壁之后，又搬出了另一个新鲜的话题，说什么朝中方面的医疗人员“向美国战俘进行大规模的医药试验”，例子是，有人说，“在医院里看见他们把十五个美国人的肋肉割开，在皮肤下层放进一小片肉”。但是对于这种先进的医学界早已广泛应用的组织疗法的手术，合众社记者自己也不得不勉强加上一个注释说：“据信这是苏联皮肤植肉法的一种新的医疗法。”合众社用恶毒的口吻提到的另一个例子是：有一些战俘在被注射之后“一会儿就死了”。报告这件事的士兵摩斯说，“他不知道这些战俘生什么病”。自然，对于这个记者来说，他完全用不着查问什么病情，他的任务到此已经完成。
    然而美国的雇佣造谣家们的不幸是他们无法一手掩盖住天下的耳目。朝中医疗人员的人道主义的高贵品质和高超的技术与医疗效率，连在汶山负责检验被遣返的战俘体格的大不列颠营皇家加拿大医疗队主任医官赫瑟林顿少校也承认，他在八日向路透社记者发表谈话说：据他了解，中国医生对他们的战俘照顾得很好，“他们的效率似乎很高”。他说：“我刚刚看到过一个人，他的扁桃腺是用外科小刀除去的，除了小刀以外，没有用正式的外科器具，这一手术做得很好。”他说，盲肠手术也“令人满意”。由于营养充足和医疗照顾的周到，释放回来的英联邦士兵“还没有发现一个患肺结核或其他肺病的人”。而“附设在该营的专门照顾营养不良的病人的营养专家没有工作可做”。该营的另一个军官说：回来的战俘“大多数看上去比我们这里的士兵还要健康”。事实上，不仅是英国战俘，而且是所有美国战俘和其他战俘，都受到同样的人道的待遇。美国战俘尤金·路许曾经根据他在碧潼战俘营医院中的亲身体验写道：“医生们护士们尽一切力量帮助病人迅速恢复健康并且使他们在医院中的生活过得很好。我对那些医生和护士的感觉是：他们对于我来说，简直像兄弟和姊妹一般。”
    迄今为止，造谣诬蔑的效果，连美国御用宣传机关自己也感觉并不令人满意。因此，它们正在竭力想从各个不同的新的“角度”，来进一步散布五颜六色的谎话。值得注意的是，合众社纽约总社九日发给它的记者威尔米伦一个指示，要他“从波多黎各士兵的角度”来“报道”战俘被“虐待”情况。这个指示提醒他“不要忘记利用某些事情”来表明在战俘营中和美国战俘在一起的波多黎各士兵被“虐待”致死和“表明（他们）抵抗共方宣传”的“事例”，指示说不管是哪里来的消息都行。
    由此可见，美国通讯社正在开足马力制造用心恶毒的挑衅性的谰言。世界舆论对于这些谣言的背后所隐藏的政治阴谋，必须保持高度的警惕。
