Yan'an People's Hospital Gains Experience Using the "Ammonia Hand-Washing Method"

    The Yan'an People's Hospital in Shaanxi Province has achieved good results using the "Ammonia Hand-Washing Method." From its establishment in April 1950 to November 1951, the hospital's surgical suppuration rate was 3.75%. After starting the ammonia hand-washing method in November 1951, and continuing until June of this year, the hospital performed a total of 1,950 surgeries, with 1,219 being clean surgeries. Except for one case where a surgical instrument was accidentally contaminated by the instrument handler, resulting in wound suppuration, all suppuration phenomena were eliminated.

    The "Ammonia Hand-Washing Method" is an advanced experience in Soviet medical technology. Its characteristics are effectiveness, simplicity, and economy. Ammonia can penetrate deep into the skin, dissolving and removing bacteria and other debris hidden in the deep layers of skin fat without the need for vigorous scrubbing. At the same time, because ammonia produces a new weakly alkaline compound—ammonium hydroxide—when dissolved in water, it does not damage the skin, but instead protects it. In the past, the Yan'an People's Hospital used the soap hand-washing method. The sodium soap or laundry soap used in this method decomposes slowly and does not produce enough caustic soda, so it cannot fully dissolve the deep layers of skin fat and eliminate the bacteria inside the fat. Even with strong drugs like alcohol and mercuric chloride, it is difficult to penetrate deeply; they can only coagulate the fat into a thin film inside the skin. During surgery, slight movement can cause the film to rupture and fall off, infecting the wound with the bacteria inside. Furthermore, laundry soap also contains uncombined free alkali, which can kill living cells on the hands, coagulate proteins, redden the skin, and even cause the epithelium to peel off, damaging the skin.

    Using ammonia for hand-washing is not only thoroughly disinfected but also very economical. According to the hospital's statistics, using the ammonia hand-washing method for one year and seven months saved a total of 2.15 million yuan compared to using the soap hand-washing method, which is equivalent to the hospital's funding for 13 and a half years of using the ammonia hand-washing method. At the same time, washing hands with ammonia only takes eight to ten minutes, saving five to seven minutes compared to washing hands with soap. This time-saving is invaluable for acutely ill patients.

    延安人民医院使用“阿母尼亚洗手法”取得经验
    陕西省延安人民医院使用“阿母尼亚洗手法”，获得良好效果。该院在一九五○年四月成立后，到一九五一年十一月这一年零七个月当中，手术化脓率是百分之三点七五；一九五一年十一月开始使用阿母尼亚洗手法后，到今年六月这一年零七个月中，共作手术一千九百五十次，洁净手术一千二百一十九例，除其中一例因司械者不慎，染污钳子，致使伤口化脓外，全部消灭了化脓现象。
    “阿母尼亚洗手法”是苏联医疗技术方面的先进经验。它的特点是有效、简便、节约。阿母尼亚可以渗入皮肤深层，不必强烈刷洗，就能溶解及清除藏在皮肤深层脂肪内的细菌及其他杂物；同时由于阿母尼亚溶于水时产生新的弱咸性化合物——氢氧化铵，所以不致损坏皮肤，反而能对皮肤起保护作用。延安人民医院过去使用肥皂洗手法。这种洗手法采用的钠肥皂或洗衣肥皂因为强盐基分解缓慢，产生的苛性钠也不多，所以不能充分溶解皮肤深层的脂肪和消除脂肪内部的细菌，即使用酒精及升汞等强力药物，也难以深入，只能在皮肤内把脂肪凝集成一层薄膜。在动手术时稍经活动，薄膜即行破裂脱落，这样伤口就会被其内的细菌感染。此外，洗衣肥皂还含有未化合的游离咸，能使手上的生活细胞死亡、蛋白凝固、皮肤渐红，甚至使上皮脱落，损坏皮肤。
    使用阿母尼亚洗手，不仅消毒彻底，而且十分节约。据该院统计，在使用阿母尼亚洗手法的一年零七个月中，比使用肥皂洗手法共节省了二百一十五万元，这等于该院使用阿母尼亚洗手法十三年半的经费；同时用阿母尼亚洗手只需八——十分钟，比用肥皂洗手节省五——七分钟。这种时间的节省对于急性病人来说，其价值是不能用数字计算的。
