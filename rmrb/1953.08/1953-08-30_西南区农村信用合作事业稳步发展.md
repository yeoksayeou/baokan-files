The rural credit cooperative undertakings in the Southwest Region are developing steadily under the principle of "focusing on pilot projects and gradually promoting them." As of the end of May, 66 credit cooperatives and 242 credit mutual aid groups had been established throughout the region. Among the 66 credit cooperatives in the region, approximately 20% were established entirely voluntarily by the masses, with sound internal systems, normal business development, basically balanced deposits and loans, and the ability to be self-sufficient. Approximately 70% had internal systems that were not sound enough, business development that was not normal enough, fewer deposits than loans, and required support from bank loans. Approximately 10% in the region were organized in a vigorous and coercive manner, with members dissatisfied with the cooperative, unclear systems and accounts, inability to conduct business, and sole reliance on bank loan support. For the latter type of credit cooperative, various localities have begun to carry out rectification work based on the opinions of the masses.

Credit cooperatives in various places have played the following roles in developing agricultural and sideline production and solving the financial difficulties of the masses: First, they have organized idle rural funds, adjusted them among themselves, and solved some of the financial difficulties of farmers in production and life. In the first quarter, the 45 cooperatives in Sichuan Province absorbed 7,166.15 million yuan in farmers' deposits and issued 5,411.51 million yuan in loans, of which sideline loans accounted for 45.3%, agricultural production loans accounted for 35.3%, and other living loans accounted for 19.4%. In places where credit cooperatives have been established, they have played a certain role in combating usury exploitation. In Hantun Township, Bijie County, Guizhou Province, there used to be usurious exploitation such as "death pledges" of land sold in March. After the development of credit cooperative business, the funds needed by farmers have been mainly lent by credit cooperatives. Second, the close combination of credit cooperatives and production mutual aid groups has promoted the consolidation and development of mutual aid groups. For example, the Gujing Township Credit Cooperative in Santai County, Sichuan Province, signed a "savings and loan contract" with production mutual aid groups, and, according to the production needs of its members, adopted the method of joint loans and joint distribution or joint loans and separate use to support the production of mutual aid groups. Third, credit cooperatives are generally located in market towns and are open for business on market days. Farmers deposit or repay loans after selling agricultural and sideline products; farmers who have obtained loans can buy fertilizers, farm tools, draught animals, and daily necessities in the market. Therefore, credit cooperatives promote the activity of the primary market. On average, around 500 people come to the Shizi Township Credit Cooperative in Bishan County to deposit, withdraw, borrow, and repay loans during each market day, which promptly solves the needs of the masses for small sums of money and the difficulties of members in production and life.

The main problems currently existing in credit cooperatives in the Southwest Region are: credit cooperatives generally have the idea of "emphasizing lending and neglecting saving" and neglect in-kind deposit and loan work. A prominent example is the Datong Township Credit Cooperative in Jintang County, Sichuan Province, which has deposits of 220,000 yuan, shares of 19,590,000 yuan, and loans of 8,841,000 yuan, and has borrowed 7,196,000 yuan from the bank. This type of credit cooperative has actually become an agency for the state bank to issue agricultural loans. At the same time, because many bank cadres do not have a clear understanding of the nature of credit cooperatives, they either take over everything or let things drift, and lack correct support. Some treat credit cooperatives as affiliated institutions of state banks or entrust them with too much agency banking business, which affects the development of credit cooperative business. Some local banks adopt methods similar to managing private money shops to treat credit cooperatives, replacing assistance and leadership with "restrictions." These biases must be corrected through continued education of cadres in order to steadily develop rural credit cooperative undertakings.

### 西南区农村信用合作事业稳步发展

    西南区农村信用合作事业稳步发展
    西南区农村信用合作事业，在“重点试办，逐步推广”的方针下，获得稳步发展。截至五月底，全区已成立信用合作社六十六个，信用互助组二百四十二个。在全区六十六个信用合作社中，组社完全出于群众自觉自愿，社内制度健全，业务发展正常，存放款基本平衡，能自力更生的信用社，约占总数百分之二十左右；社内制度不够健全，业务发展不够正常，存少放多，需银行贷款扶持的信用社，约占总数百分之七十左右；而用大轰大擂强迫命令方式组织起来，社员对社不满，制度账目不清，业务不能开展，单纯依靠银行贷款扶持的信用社，在全区约占百分之十。对于后一类信用社，目前各地都开始根据群众意见进行整理工作。
    各地信用合作社在发展农副业生产，解决群众资金困难方面，发挥了如下作用：第一，组织了农村闲散资金，相互调剂，解决了部分农民生产生活中的资金困难。四川省四十五个社在第一季度，吸收农民存款七十一亿六千六百一十五万元，发放贷款五十四亿一千一百五十一万元，其中副业放款占百分之四十五点三，农业生产贷款占百分之三十五点三，其他生活贷款占百分之十九点四。凡建立了信用合作社的地方，对打击高利贷剥削起到了一定作用。贵州省毕节县汉屯乡，过去有“三月死当”的土地卖押等高利贷剥削，当信用合作业务开展后，农民所需资金，已主要由信用社贷放了。第二，信用社和生产互助组密切结合，促进了互助组的巩固和发展。如四川省三台县古井乡信用社和生产互助组签订了“储贷合同”，并根据社员生产需要，采用伙贷伙分或伙贷分用方式，扶助互助组生产。第三，信用社一般都设在场镇上，每逢场期营业，农民卖了农副产品，就来存款或归还贷款；贷到款的农民可在市场上买进肥料、农具、耕畜及生活用品，因之，信用社促进了初级市场的活跃。璧山县狮子乡每逢场集，到信用社存、取、贷、还款的平均约五百人上下，及时解决了群众零碎资金需要、和社员生产生活困难。
    当前西南区信用合作社存在的主要问题是：信用社一般都存在“重放轻存”思想，忽视实物存贷工作。较突出的如四川金堂县大同乡信用社，存款二十二万元，股金一千九百五十九万元，放款八千八百四十一万元，向银行贷款七千一百九十六万元，这一类信用社实际上已变成为国家银行发放农贷的代理机构。同时，由于不少银行干部，对信用社性质认识不清，往往不是包办代替，就是放任自流，而缺乏正确的扶植，有的把信用社当成国家银行的附属机构，或者过多地委托代理银行业务，影响信用社业务的发展。还有些地方银行则采用与管理私营钱庄相类似的办法来对待信用合作社，以“限制”代替了扶助和领导。这些偏向都须继续教育干部加以纠正，以稳步发展农村信用合作事业。
