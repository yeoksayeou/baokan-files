Financial departments of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province are strengthening investigation and research, improving operations, and supplying production materials and living materials needed by the Tibetan people in a timely manner. This year, the financial departments of the autonomous region dispatched Tibetan cadres familiar with the situation to investigate the needs of the Tibetan people in the region for materials, and then formulated plans and carried out procurement based on this situation. From January to June this year, the Autonomous Region National Trade Company supplied more than 33,000 pieces of agricultural tools, wool shears, and other tools, and 5,000 iron pots for boiling tea and frying highland barley. The department store also transferred a large number of crimson fabrics favored by Tibetan people and lamas from Shanghai; in order to meet the needs of the pastoral areas, the grain company transferred a lot of grain from the agricultural areas.

This year, the National Trade Company's funds increased by 22.2 percent compared to last year. Comparing the supply volume of the first half of this year with the first half of last year, tea increased by 141.7 percent and homespun cloth increased by 187.6 percent. The various types of khaki, serge, and woolen cloth supplied by the department store in the first half of this year increased by 198.4 percent compared to the whole of last year.

    加强调查研究及时供应物资
    西康省藏族自治区财经部门加强调查研究，改进业务，及时供应藏族人民所需要的生产资料和生活资料。今年自治区财经部门曾分别派出熟悉情况的藏族干部，调查区内藏族人民对物资的需要情况，然后根据这种情况订制计划，进行采购。自治区民族贸易公司从今年一月到六月止，已供应农具、羊毛剪等工具三万三千多件、熬茶和炒青稞的铁锅五千口。百货公司又从上海调来大批藏族人民和喇嘛们所喜爱的绛色布料；粮食公司为满足牧区人民的需要，从农业区调去了很多粮食。
    今年民族贸易公司的资金比去年增加了百分之二十二点二。以今年上半年和去年上半年的供应量比较，茶叶增加了百分之一百四十一点七、土布增加了百分之一百八十七点六。百货公司今年上半年供应的各色卡叽、哔叽和贡呢，比去年全年增加了百分之一百九十八点四。（新华社）
