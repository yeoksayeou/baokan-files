    Too Many Proofreading Errors in the July Issue of "Chemistry Bulletin"
    Reader Zhang Qixie writes: There are too many proofreading errors in the July 1953 issue of "Chemistry Bulletin" edited by the Chinese Chemical Society. On the first page of this magazine (i.e., the 269th page overall), there are several obvious errors, such as printing "wax" as "preserved meat," "artificial fertilizer" as "humanitarian fertilizer," and "fiber" as "weak fiber." On page 312 overall, the chemical symbols for elements such as "amine" and "urea" are also incorrect. Other errors—such as printing "reference" as "reference ginseng" and "carbon" as "ash"—are too numerous to mention. I have already discovered more than forty such errors in my preliminary reading. These errors have already caused inconvenience to readers. What is even more intolerable is that the name "Lenin" was printed upside down on page 282 of the publication. I believe that the editorial department of Chemistry Bulletin should improve this careless working style in the future, conscientiously and responsibly do a good job of proofreading, and avoid similar situations from happening again.

    “化学通报”七月号校勘上的错误太多
    读者张起燮来信：中国化学会编辑的一九五三年七月号“化学通报”校勘上的错误太多。这本杂志的第一页（即总第二六九页）上就有将“蜡”印成“腊”、将“人造肥料”印成“人道肥料”、将“纤维”印成“维纤”等数处很明显的错误。总第三一二页将“胺”、“脲”等元素的化学符号也弄错了，其他错误——如将“参考”印成“考参”、将“炭”印成“灰”等——多得不胜枚举，仅据我初步阅读时检查已发现有四十多处。这些错误，已使读者感到很不方便；而更令人不能容忍的是，该刊总第二八二页还将“列宁”的名字印颠倒了。我认为：化学通报编辑部今后应该改进这种粗枝大叶的工作作风，认真负责地作好校对工作，避免再发生类似情况。
