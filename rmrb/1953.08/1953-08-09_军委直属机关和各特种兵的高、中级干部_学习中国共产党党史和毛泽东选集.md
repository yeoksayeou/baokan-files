High and mid-level cadres of the departments directly under the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission and various special forces, on the basis of their political theory studies in the first half of the year, began studying the History of the Communist Party of China and "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in early July, according to the specific circumstances of the military system. This study takes Lenin and Stalin's major works on the Chinese revolution and "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" as basic study materials, and Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" and the "Outline for Teaching the History of the Communist Party of China (First Draft)" compiled by the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department of the Military Commission as auxiliary study materials. According to the historical order and the basic situation of each period, the study focuses on Mao Zedong's stance, viewpoints, and methods in handling Chinese revolution issues. Through this study, cadres are required to understand the rich experience of the Party in leading the Chinese revolution; to study the history of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong in struggling against various opportunist thoughts and the enemies of the people in various complex historical environments, so as to deepen their theoretical understanding of Marxism-Leninism and enhance their class consciousness and political vigilance; to understand the laws of social development and political struggle in China, to improve their political theory level and policy level, and to further enhance their confidence in the victory of the Chinese revolution and construction.

This study is under the unified direct leadership of the General Political Department of the Military Commission. The Propaganda Department of the General Political Department is responsible for formulating teaching plans, compiling teaching outlines and teaching programs, organizing reports, and exchanging learning experiences. All departments directly under the Military Commission attach great importance to this study. The General Political Department of the Military Commission, the Directly Subordinate Political Department, the General Rear Services Department, and others have invited comrades such as Hu Qiaomu and Xiao Xiangrong to make study reports. The main responsible cadres of each department also personally made mobilization reports. This study will be the beginning of the systematic political theory study for high and mid-level cadres of the organs directly under the Military Commission, and is expected to be completed in one and a half to two years.

    军委直属机关和各特种兵的高、中级干部
    学习中国共产党党史和毛泽东选集
    中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会直属机关各部和各特种兵的高、中级干部在上半年政治理论学习的基础上，根据军事系统的具体情况已在七月初旬开始中国共产党党史、“毛泽东选集”的学习。这次学习是以列宁、斯大林有关中国革命问题的主要著作和“毛泽东选集”为基本学习材料，以胡乔木的“中国共产党的三十年”和军委总政治部宣传部编写的“中国共产党党史教学大纲（初稿）”为辅助学习材料，按照历史顺序、各时期的基本情况，学习毛泽东同志处理中国革命问题的立场、观点和方法。通过这次学习，要求领会党领导中国革命的丰富经验；要求研究党和毛泽东同志在各种复杂的历史环境中，和各种机会主义思想进行斗争，和人民的敌人进行斗争的历史，以加深马克思列宁主义的理论认识，提高阶级觉悟和政治警惕性；要求认识中国社会发展和政治斗争的规律，提高政治理论水平和政策水平，并进一步增强对中国革命事业与建设事业的必胜信心。
    这次学习是由军委总政治部统一直接领导的。由总政治部宣传部统一制订教学计划，编写教学大纲和教学方案，组织报告，交流学习经验等。军委直属机关各部对这次学习都十分重视。军委总政治部、直属政治部、总后方勤务部等都分别请胡乔木、萧向荣等同志作了学习报告。各部的主要负责干部也亲自作了动员报告。这一学习将成为军委直属机关高、中级干部系统的政治理论学习的开始，预计在一年半到两年内学完。
