(Dispatch from this newspaper) Since the conclusion of the Seventh National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, trade union cadres at all levels across the country have conscientiously studied the congress documents and disseminated them to the broad masses of workers in factories, mines, and construction sites. Over the past two months, the broad masses of workers and trade union cadres have gradually clarified their understanding of the basic tasks of trade unions during the period of the nation's new economic construction and have actively implemented them.

The regions that have studied and disseminated the various documents of the congress so far include: Rehe, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Lüda, and Shenyang in the Northeast region; Hebei, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Beijing, and Tianjin in the North China region; Xinjiang and Xi'an in the Northwest region; Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi in the Central South region; Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, and Shanghai in the East China region; and Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Chongqing in the Southwest region. This study and implementation of the congress resolutions was carried out under the specific leadership of the Party. After returning from the congress, the delegates reported to the local Party committees, which aroused the attention of Party committees in various places. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in its instructions, required cadres of Party committees, trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and relevant departments at all levels to study earnestly. In Chongqing, Guizhou, Yunnan, Xikang and other places, the local Party committees presided over meetings of responsible cadres of the local Party, government, army, and people's organizations to listen to the transmission reports. Trade unions in various localities attached particular importance to the study by cadres. The Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions believed that enabling cadres to deeply understand the spirit of the congress resolutions was an important link in correctly implementing the congress resolutions. Guangxi Province criticized some cadres for their erroneous thinking that it was "the same old stuff" and "nothing more than that." When cadres in various places studied, they generally adopted the methods of holding cadre meetings or running short-term training courses. Trade union organizations in various places organized delegates attending the congress to transmit the information to workers, and some regions also convened trade union member representative conferences.

This study has greatly improved the ideological level of trade union cadres. First of all, it made them realize that trade unions must take developing production as their central task under the leadership of the Party, and gradually improve the material and cultural lives and working conditions of workers according to necessity and possibility. They also criticized various degrees of economism and syndicalism tendencies. The Rehe Provincial Federation of Trade Unions examined its past unclear understanding of the policy of taking development of production as the center, which resulted in two deviations: unilaterally emphasizing workers' welfare and relaxing production, and isolatedly calling for production without caring about workers' lives. The Beijing Railway Trade Union examined that in the past, it had extracted most of its manpower to engage in sideline production. Although it had made some achievements in solving the welfare problems of employees, it mistakenly thought that this was the basic task of trade union work. Second, some trade union organizations and cadres who had tendencies to deviate from the leadership of the Party have now more deeply realized the importance of the Party's leadership. Some erroneous ideas have been thoroughly criticized. After studying, the cadres of the Lüda Municipal Federation of Trade Unions realized their past mistakes and automatically made self-criticisms at the Party committee meeting. Third, trade union cadres have a relatively clear understanding of "the trade union is a school of communism," which is particularly reflected in the recent work of strengthening labor discipline education in various places. Trade union cadres in state-owned and private enterprises in Tianjin took the initiative to understand the ideological situation of workers and educate workers to correct the phenomenon of lax labor discipline, which resulted in significant achievements in their work.

Many trade union organizations have reviewed and promoted current work in accordance with the spirit of the documents, which is concentrated in the rectification of labor discipline. The Chongqing Municipal Construction Trade Union combined the opposition to the phenomenon of no one being responsible and the rectification of labor discipline, transmitted the resolutions of the congress, promoted production work, and increased the attendance rate from 60 percent in the past to 85 percent. After studying the documents, the cadres of the Lüda Municipal Federation of Trade Unions specially studied the experience of the Wusan Factory in carrying out labor competitions with planned management as the center. In the discussion of the congress resolutions, workers in various places further established the view that "the national plan is the law." Workers in Northeast China strived to improve product quality, abide by labor discipline, and improve their class consciousness in labor competitions, so many factories, mines, and groups completed their production plans on schedule or ahead of schedule.

At present, trade unions in various places should pay attention to the following issues when studying the congress documents. First, we must attach importance to the leadership of learning. Some units emphasized that central work was busy and they had no time to study; some units only deployed and did not check; some people, when checking economism tendencies, regarded the welfare undertakings that state-owned enterprises should run as committing economism errors; some people were afraid of committing economism errors and dared not mention employee welfare, disease treatment, and over-quota rewards in their work. These are all deviations caused by a lack of correct leadership, and should be corrected. Second, we must oppose the phenomenon of mechanically applying in the study. The trade union cadres in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, blindly engaged in the struggle against economism and syndicalism among the workers without considering the specific circumstances. Some have an impatient mood, do not seriously organize cadres and the masses to study, and think that reporting the congress documents will solve all problems. This method is wrong. It must be recognized that deeply implementing the resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is a constant and meticulous ideological education work, and any impatient mood is harmful.

### 各地普遍学习中国工会全国代表大会文件  提高了工会干部思想水平

    各地普遍学习中国工会全国代表大会文件
    提高了工会干部思想水平
    【本报讯】中国工会第七次全国代表大会闭幕后，全国各级工会干部认真学习了大会文件，向工厂、矿山、工地广大职工进行了传达。两个多月来，广大职工和工会干部逐渐明确认识到工会在祖国新经济建设时期的基本任务，并积极贯彻执行。
    到现在为止，学习和传达大会各种文件的地区有：东北区的热河、黑龙江、松江、辽东、辽西、旅大、沈阳；华北区的河北、山西、绥远、北京、天津；西北区的新疆、西安；中南区的河南、湖南、江西、广东、广西；华东区的山东、江苏、福建、上海；西南区的四川、西康、云南、贵州、重庆等。这次学习和贯彻大会的决议，是在党的具体领导下进行的。出席大会的代表们回去以后，即向当地党委作了汇报，引起了各地党委的重视。中共中央东北局在指示中要求各级党委、工会、青年团和有关部门的干部都要认真学习。重庆、贵州、云南、西康等地，由党委主持召开当地党、政府、部队和人民团体的负责干部会议，听取了传达报告。各地工会特别重视干部的学习，河南省工会联合会认为使干部深刻领会大会决议的精神是正确贯彻大会决议的重要环节。广西省批判了一些干部认为“老一套”、“不过如此”的错误思想。各地干部学习时一般都采取了召开干部会议或举办短期训练班的方式。各地工会组织了出席大会的代表向职工作传达，有的地区还召开了工会会员代表大会。
    这次学习大大提高了工会干部的思想水平。首先使他们认识了工会必须在党的领导下以发展生产为中心任务，并按照必要与可能逐步改善工人物质和文化生活和劳动条件，他们也批判了各种不同程度的经济主义和工联主义的倾向。热河省工会联合会检查了过去对以发展生产为中心的方针认识不清，因而发生了片面强调工人福利、放松生产和孤立地号召生产、不关心工人生活的两种偏向。北京铁路工会检查出过去抽出大部分人力搞副业生产，在解决职工福利问题上，虽然做出了一些成绩，可是当时竟错误地以为这就是工会工作的基本任务。第二，一些有脱离党的领导倾向的工会组织和干部，这次更深刻地认识到党的领导的重要性。一些错误思想都得到了彻底的批判。旅大市工会干部在学习后认识了过去的错误，自动地在党委会上作了检讨。第三，对“工会是共产主义的学校”，工会干部都有了比较明确的认识，特别表现在最近各地加强劳动纪律教育的工作上。天津市国营和私营企业中的工会干部，主动去了解工人思想情况，教育工人纠正劳动纪律松弛的现象，从而使工作收到显著成绩。
    许多工会组织依照文件精神检查和推动了当前工作，集中表现在整顿劳动纪律方面。重庆市建筑工会结合反对无人负责现象和整顿劳动纪律，传达了大会决议，推动了生产工作，出勤率由过去百分之六十提高到百分之八十五。旅大市工会干部在学习文件后，特别研究了五三工厂以计划管理为中心开展劳动竞赛的经验。各地职工在讨论大会决议中，进一步树立了“国家计划就是法律”的观点。东北职工在劳动竞赛中努力改善产品质量，遵守劳动纪律，提高阶级觉悟，因而不少厂矿和小组都按期或提前完成了生产计划。
    目前各地工会在学习大会文件中，应注意如下问题。第一，必须重视学习的领导工作。有些单位强调中心工作忙，没有时间学；有些单位光布置，不检查；有人检查经济主义倾向时，把国营企业应举办的福利事业，也当着犯了经济主义错误；有些人怕犯经济主义错误，在工作中对职工福利、疾病治疗、超额奖励都不敢提了。这都是由于缺乏正确领导所发生的偏向，应当注意纠正。第二，反对学习中生搬硬套的现象。湖南湘潭县工会干部不根据具体情况，盲目在职工中搞反对经济主义、反对工联主义的斗争。有的有急躁情绪，不认真组织干部和群众学习，以为将大会文件报告一下，一切问题就能解决。这种方法是不对的。必须认识到：深入贯彻中国工会第七次全国代表大会决议，是一个经常的细致的思想教育工作，任何急躁情绪都是有害的。
