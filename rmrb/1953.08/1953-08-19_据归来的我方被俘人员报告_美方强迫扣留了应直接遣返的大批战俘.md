Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th. To date, the U.S. side is unwilling to provide us with the accurate total number of prisoners of war for direct repatriation; in his letter of May 27th, Clark stated that the total number of our captured personnel to be directly repatriated was 76,000, but the U.S. side later reduced this number to 74,000. The U.S. side has not provided any explanation for this difference of 2,000. What is the reason for this? From the information provided by our captured personnel returning every day, the answer to this question can be found. It turns out that the U.S. side has detained a large number of our captured personnel, therefore, it cannot explain this to us.

According to reports from returned North Korean People's Army prisoners of war, around the time of the signing of the armistice agreement, the U.S. side imprisoned more than 500 North Korean People's Army prisoners of war, including Ri Im-cheol and Kim Jang-jong (transliterations), in the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp on charges such as "saying they saw the Allied forces kill prisoners of war and 'civilians.'"

In the Yongcho Island prisoner of war camp, more than 40 of our captured personnel, including Han Myeong-seo (transliteration), were forcibly moved by the U.S. side in mid-July without any reason, and their whereabouts are unknown since.

The number of sporadic arrests is even more countless. On June 25th this year, the U.S. side fabricated the excuse of so-called "resistance to leadership" and arrested Yun Cheol-ha. On August 8th, they arrested Choe Yong-sam, Yun Jin-seon, and Ri Deok-bang, among others, on the grounds of "incorrect card list" and "orders from superiors." The U.S. side arrested North Korean People's Army officers Ri Yeong-sun, Ri Ha-bae, Kim Yeong-jeong, and Ji Jeong-bak (transliterations) in the 14th Busan Hospital, and their whereabouts are still unknown.

Park Sa-hyeon, who was arrested by the U.S. side in October 1952 on the charge of so-called "leading a prisoner of war riot," is still imprisoned. Park Sa-hyeon was elected by all the captured personnel as the overall representative of the Geoje Island prisoners of war during the "Dodd Incident" in May last year, when he opposed the U.S. side's forced detention of prisoners of war.

North Korean People's Army prisoners of war returning from Geoje Island, Yongcho Island, and other places said that the U.S. side is still conducting sinister activities in the prisoner of war camps, carrying out so-called "voluntary repatriation" reviews that are in reality forced detentions of our captured personnel.

According to returned Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, around the time of the signing of the armistice agreement, the U.S. side seized at least two to three hundred people from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, and these people were included in the prisoners of war to be directly repatriated.

### 据归来的我方被俘人员报告  美方强迫扣留了应直接遣返的大批战俘

    据归来的我方被俘人员报告
    美方强迫扣留了应直接遣返的大批战俘
    【新华社开城十八日电】迄今为止，美方不愿意向我方提供直接遣返战俘的确实总数；克拉克在五月二十七日的来信中曾说，应予直接遣返的我方被俘人员总数是七万六千人，但美方后来却把这个数目减为七万四千名，对于这两千名差额，美方也没有作任何交代。这是什么原因呢？从每天遣返归来的我方被俘人员提供的情况中，已经可以找出这个问题的答案，原来美方扣留了我方大批被俘人员，因此，它无法向我方交代。
    据归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员报告，在停战协定签订前后，美方在巨济岛战俘营内以“说过看见联军杀害战俘、‘平民’”等罪名前后将朝鲜人民军被俘人员李任哲、金长钟（译音）等五百余人投入监狱。
    在龙草岛战俘营我方被俘人员韩明书（译音）等四十多人，于七月中旬被美方毫无理由地强迫迁移，以后即不知去向。
    零星被逮捕者更是数不胜数。今年六月二十五日，美方制造所谓“反抗领导”的藉口，逮捕了尹哲河。八月八日，又以“卡片名单不正确”和“奉上级命令”为名逮捕了崔用三、尹镇善、李德芳等人。美方曾在釜山第十四医院中将被俘的朝鲜人民军军官李永淳、李河培、金永晶、池正朴（译音）等人逮捕，迄今不知去向。
    一九五二年十月间被美方以所谓“领导战俘暴动”罪名逮捕的朴四铉，迄今仍被监禁着。朴四铉在去年五月间反对美方强迫扣留战俘的“杜德事件”中，曾被全体被俘人员推选为巨济岛战俘总代表。
    从巨济岛、龙草岛等地归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员说，美方仍在战俘营中，对我方被俘人员进行名为审查“自愿遣返”实为强迫扣留的罪恶勾当。
    据归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员说，在停战协定签字前后，美方从中国人民志愿军被俘人员中至少抓走了二、三百人，而这些人是列入应予直接遣返的战俘中的。
