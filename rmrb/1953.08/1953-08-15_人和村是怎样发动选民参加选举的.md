    How Renhe Village Mobilized Voters to Participate in Elections
    Liaoning Provincial Popular Election Pilot Work Team
    After undergoing popular election propaganda and education, the masses in Renhe Village, Bianmen District, Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province, valued their democratic rights. In particular, after the nomination of representative candidates, they further realized the importance of elections. Therefore, after the list of people's representative candidates was announced, they actively requested to participate in the election. The voter turnout in the entire village reached 92.5%, and one electoral district achieved 100% voter participation.

    According to the experience of Renhe Village, doing a good job in various preparations before the election meeting is crucial to mobilizing the largest possible number of voters to participate in the election. After the representative candidates were nominated, the Renhe Village Election Committee, the Party branch, and propagandists promptly convened meetings to specifically discuss the content of the propaganda, election organization methods, and other matters, and passed two resolutions: First, mobilize the masses to complete the first round of weeding as soon as possible, ensuring that not a single seedling is damaged to welcome the election; Second, determine that the election meeting will be held at 8:00 AM on June 7th. The meeting also studied how to mobilize the masses to contribute ideas and find solutions to ensure the largest possible number of voters participate in the election. After the meeting, the masses expressed active support for the Election Committee's production call and the candidates' actions. The masses said, "The candidates were nominated by everyone, why not support them?" Jiang Shuqing's team of four laborers completed the weeding plan within three days, carried out replanting, and also helped others with weeding. After Gao Yinglan was elected as a candidate, she led the women and men of the entire team to launch a rice transplanting competition. The masses in the entire village greeted the election meeting with active production, turning the election into a driving force for promoting production.

    Next, the village Election Committee carried out organizational work and consulted with the masses on how to solve the practical difficulties of some voters in participating in the election. The masses in Renhe Village recognized the importance of participating in the election and requested to participate, but there were many practical difficulties. Such as "no one to look after the house," "no one to take care of chickens, ducks, and pigs," "women with young children have no one to watch them," "the elderly, the weak, the sick, and women in confinement cannot come out," "need to herd cattle and pigs," and "no one to cook," etc. If these practical problems are not solved, voters will not be able to participate in the election with peace of mind. After discussing these issues with the masses, solutions were devised: First, the election meeting will be held on Sunday, with elementary school students looking after the houses; Second, strengthen militia patrols; Third, cook early, and first enclose chickens, ducks, and livestock; Fourth, thoroughly eliminate fire hazards to prevent fire alarms; Fifth, the sick, the weak, women in confinement, and those herding livestock will have their ballots cast by others; Sixth, children will be taken care of by elementary school students, and those breastfeeding will be brought to the meeting place. The masses were most afraid of fire and theft, so the fire prevention and theft prevention work was done very carefully and meticulously. Paying attention to these small details and thoughtfully taking care of the voters can enable voters to participate in the election with peace of mind and full enthusiasm.

    Another important task in the preparation work is to pay attention to mobilizing women to participate in the election. This is a key to ensuring that the largest possible number of voters participate in the election. Renhe Village paid attention to the work of mobilizing women from the beginning, and made special arrangements in every step and every task, implementing education on equality between men and women. Before the election, even more practical arrangements were made in light of the actual difficulties of women to ensure that they could participate in the election with peace of mind.

    Before the election meeting, Renhe Village also used propagandists to publicize the importance of participating in the election to voters, explained the time and place of the meeting, and mobilized voters to attend on time. At the same time, training was conducted for the chairman of the election meeting. A trial was first conducted in one electoral district, with the chairman of the village Election Committee demonstrating how to be a good chairman of the election meeting. In the beginning, because only oral instructions were given and no practical training was conducted, some people did not know how to be the chairman, forming a "double act." For example, during the election, some electoral districts did not count the number of votes, but counted those who did not raise their hands, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. After learning from the experiences and lessons of the three electoral districts, the election meetings in other electoral districts were held very well.

    In order to facilitate voter elections, Renhe Village adopted methods such as "bringing ballots," "bringing opinions," and the election meeting sending representatives to actively solicit opinions for the twenty people who could not attend the meeting due to illness, with the approval of the election committee, so that voters could exercise their electoral rights under certain difficult conditions. The election meeting generally lasted for one hour to one and a half hours. The main reason why the meeting could be so short was that preparations had been made in advance.

    The election meeting was held on June 7th. Of the 640 voters in the entire village, 592 actually participated in the election, accounting for 92.5% of the total number of voters, and one electoral district reached 100%. The village elected 19 representatives who were doing a good job, actively engaged in production, and loved by the masses, including 3 women. When the election meeting was held, the entire village was like celebrating a new year, with men and women, old and young, getting up especially early, changing into new clothes, and actively participating in the election. The meeting was scheduled to start at 8:00 AM, and people arrived by 7:30 AM. The meeting place was decorated solemnly and simply. Some voters rushed back from far away to participate in the election. Old Qi, who is 68 years old this year, received a letter from his grandson and walked back early in the morning from thirty miles away. Old Mrs. Ma went out to see her daughter, and also took the train back. They said: A family should always have a decision-maker, and a village should always elect someone to handle affairs. No matter how far away, I have to come back to vote. Some voters who had practical difficulties in attending the meeting also wrote opinion slips in advance and asked others to bring them. Some even stamped their fingerprints on the opinion slips. Some electoral districts had Korean minority people, and the masses automatically let them sit in the front row. Some teenagers and children also came to participate in the meeting, singing songs to the representatives to celebrate.

    Democratic elections not only promoted production, but also further strengthened the connection between the government and the people. After the representatives were elected, the voters entrusted the representatives with many "heartfelt words." Military family member Dai Minjiang instructed the representative: "Once you become a representative, you must not forget the masses, and you must be serious, loyal, and reliable in handling affairs. If everyone elects you, you lead us in that direction, and we will follow. If you make contributions, everyone will praise you, and if you make mistakes, everyone will criticize you." Some people who liked to "pick quarrels" also made on-the-spot self-criticisms, saying: "We must respond to the government's call, support the representatives, and never remove the ladder." The voters generally said: "Even good flowers need green leaves to support them." The representatives also expressed their determination on the spot. Guan Shikui said: "Everyone trusts me, so I will do my best to serve everyone. If there are problems, everyone can supervise me. Let's work together to improve production in our village." After being elected, the representatives generally increased their enthusiasm. Li Yongshan, a representative who was re-elected, was not active enough in his work in the past, but after being elected, he actively arranged summer weeding work. The representatives also led the convening of voter meetings to discuss current production work. The masses actively supported the production tasks arranged by the representatives elected by everyone. E Jinglin made a production plan, planning to apply 80% topdressing fertilizer when weeding the second time. Ma Lao San prepared a summer weeding challenge plan and planned to propose it at the representative meeting.

    Democratic elections have enabled cadres to specifically recognize the benefits of promoting democracy, and they generally feel that "work is easier to lead" and have learned democratic leadership methods. Therefore, a new atmosphere of democratic unity has emerged between cadres and the masses. The enthusiasm of the masses for supporting the government and urging the government to work has been greatly strengthened. In the past, because there were shortcomings in the work and democracy was not promoted enough, the masses believed that "the people are the people, and the rulers are the rulers," "democracy is ten points, the upper level occupies eight points, and only gives the masses two points." This election made the masses feel "comfortable from the heart," "democracy makes work more energetic," and the connection between the government and the people has been further strengthened.

    人和村是怎样发动选民参加选举的
    辽东省普选试点工作队
    辽东省凤城县边门区人和村群众经过普选的宣传教育，重视了自己的民主权利；特别是经过代表候选人提名，进一步体会到选举的重要，因此在人民代表候选人名单公布后，都积极要求参加选举。全村选民参加选举的达百分之九十二点五，有一个选区选民全部都参加了选举。
    发动最大多数选民参加选举，据人和村的经验，做好选举大会前的各项准备工作，是十分重要的。在代表候选人提出以后，人和村选举委员会、党支部和宣传员及时召开了会议，具体讨论了宣传内容、选举组织等办法，并通过两项决议：一、发动群众提前完成头遍铲趟，做到不伤一棵苗来迎接选举；二、确定六月七日上午八时召开选举大会。会议并研究了如何动员群众出主意想办法，保证最大多数选民参加选举的问题。会后群众对选举委员会的生产号召，候选人的行动，都表示积极支持。群众说：“候选人是大家提的，为啥不拥护。”蒋树清小组四个劳动力，在三天内完成了铲趟计划，进行了补种，还帮助别人铲趟。高英兰被选为候选人后，带动全组妇女和男子展开插秧竞赛。全村群众都以积极生产来迎接选举大会的召开，使选举形成了推动生产的动力。
    接着村选举委员会又进行了组织工作，并和群众商量如何解决部分选民参加选举的实际困难。人和村群众认识到参加选举的重要，要求参加选举，但有许多实际困难。如“没有人看家”，“鸡、鸭、猪牲畜没人照看”，“妇女有不足岁的小孩没人看”，“老弱病人、产妇出不来”，“要放牛放猪”，以及“没人做饭”，等等，这些实际问题如不加以解决，选民便不能安心参加选举。这些问题经过和群众商量后，想出解决办法：一、选举大会在星期日举行，由小学生看家；二、加强民兵放哨；三、起早做饭，鸡、鸭牲畜先圈好；四、彻底消灭火源以防火警；五、病弱产妇及放牲畜的由别人带票选举；六、小孩由小学生看管，吃奶的带到会场上。群众最怕失火、失盗，因此对防火、防盗工作做的很严密很细致。认真注意这些细节小事，并体贴照顾选民，才能使选民安心参加选举，选民情绪才能饱满。
    准备工作中的另一项重要工作，是注意发动妇女参加选举。这是保证最大多数选民参加选举的重要关键。人和村从一开始就注意了发动妇女的工作，在每一步骤、每项工作中都作了专门布置，贯彻了男女平等的教育。在选举前，更结合妇女的实际困难，作了切实安排，保证她们安心参加选举。
    人和村在选举大会之前，还通过宣传员向选民宣传参加选举的重要性，讲清开会时间、地点，动员选民按时到会。同时对选举大会主席作了训练。先在一个选区试办，由村选举委员会主席示范，训练选举委员怎样当好选举大会主席。开始因为只作了口头交代，没有作实际训练，所以有的不会当主席，形成了“唱双簧”。如选举时，有的选区不数投票人数，而数不举手的，惹起群众不满。在吸取了三个选区的经验教训之后，其他选区的选举大会就开得很好。
    为便于选民选举，人和村二十人因病不能出席大会的，经选举委员会批准，采取“带票”、“带意见”和选举大会派出代表主动征求意见等办法，使选民在某些困难的条件下也能行使自己的选举权利。选举大会一般是开一小时到一小时半。大会能够开得这样简短，主要是事先作好了准备工作。
    选举大会在六月七日召开。全村选民六百四十名，实际参加选举的有五百九十二名，占选民总数的百分之九十二点五，有一个选区达到百分之百。全村选出工作好、生产积极、群众爱戴的十九名代表，其中有妇女三名。召开选举大会时，全村像过年过节一样，男女老少都起得特别早，换上新衣服，踊跃参加选举。规定上午八点开会，七点半人就到齐了。大会布置得又隆重，又朴素。有的选民从很远的地方赶回来参加选举。老齐头今年六十八岁，接到孙子的信，从三十里地外一早走回来。马老太太出门看姑娘，也坐火车赶回来。他们说：一家总该有个主事人，一村总该举个办事人，再远我也得回来选一选。有些选民因实际困难不能到会，也事先写了意见单让别人带来。有的还在意见单上打上手戳。有些选区中有朝鲜少数民族，群众自动把他们让到前排坐下。有些少年儿童也来参加大会，给代表唱歌，庆祝。
    民主选举不仅推动了生产，同时进一步密切了政府与人民的联系。代表选出后，选民对代表嘱咐了很多“心里话”。军属戴敏江嘱咐代表说：“当上代表可不能忘了群众，办事要认真、忠实、可靠。大伙选上你，你往那领，咱往那走，有功大伙表扬，有过大伙批评。”有的好“挑皮”的人，也当场检讨说：“一定响应政府号召，支持代表，决不撤梯子。”选民普遍说：“好花还得绿叶扶。”代表也当场表示决心。关世奎说：“大家信服我，我就好好为大家办事。有毛病大家监督。咱们一心把咱村生产搞好。”代表当选后，积极性普遍提高，连选连任的代表李永山过去工作不够积极，当选后积极布置夏锄工作。代表们更领导开了选民会，讨论了当前的生产工作。群众都积极支持大家选举的代表所布置的生产任务。鄂景林订了生产计划，打算铲二遍地时施追肥百分之八十。马老三准备好夏锄挑战计划，打算开代表大会时提出来。
    民主选举使干部具体地认识到发扬民主的好处，他们普遍感到“工作好领导了”，并学会了民主领导的方法。因此，干部与群众之间出现了民主团结的新气象。群众对拥护政府要求督促政府工作的积极性大大加强。过去，因为工作中存在着缺点，发扬民主不够，群众认为“民是民，主是主”，“民主十分，上边占八分，只给群众二分”；这次选举，群众感到“从心里往外舒服”，“民主当家干活也起劲”，政府与人民的联系更进一步密切起来。
