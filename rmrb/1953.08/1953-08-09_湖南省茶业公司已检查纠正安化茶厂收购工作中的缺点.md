    Letter from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Hunan Provincial People's Government: After the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on June 7 published a reader's letter criticizing the shortcomings in our province's Anhua Tea Factory's tea procurement work, we instructed the China Tea Company's Hunan Provincial Company to be responsible for inspection and handling. Now, the results of the on-site inspection by Li Zhenhua, manager of the company, are written below:
    There are indeed chaotic phenomena in the tea procurement work in Anhua County. The procedures for purchasing tea in the county are too complicated. The "dual regulation system" was originally an advanced method for tea evaluation. After the China Tea Company's Central and Southern District Company deployed this method, the provincial company did not study practical and feasible implementation methods based on the specific conditions of the province; however, the tea factory mistakenly transformed the five grades and fourteen classes of tea into one thousand two hundred and fifty prices (in reality, the vast majority of prices are unnecessary), making the "dual regulation system" complicated and mysterious. As a result, the number of tea transactions at the purchasing stations has been greatly reduced; many tea farmers have waited for several days before selling their tea, delaying spring plowing production. In terms of assessing tea grades, some purchasing staff are overly strict, rejecting many teas that could have been purchased. Regarding tea prices, the prices set by the provincial company basically guarantee that tea farmers have appropriate profits; however, the tea evaluation personnel in the county inconsistently applied the tea prices, with varying standards among purchasing stations, and the prices of some teas were indeed assessed too low. The above situations have all harmed the interests of tea farmers, making them very dissatisfied.
    The reasons for the above situations, in addition to the repeated changes in the procurement plan of the superior company this year, and the delayed release of tea prices and standard sample teas, are mainly due to the fact that the provincial company's deployment of work was not specific enough, the explanation of policies was unclear and incomplete (one-sidedly emphasizing the improvement of tea quality, without focusing on and practically grasping the principle of guaranteeing the interests of tea farmers), and the handling was not timely after problems were discovered; the leading cadres of the tea factory did not study the policies and business seriously enough, and did not care enough about the lives of the masses. In addition, the tea evaluation personnel were all temporarily hired, and the factory did not provide them with enough education; therefore, the work attitude of some tea evaluation personnel was very poor. This is also a problem that should be solved.
    Now the provincial company and the tea factory have inspected the above errors. In addition to strengthening the leadership of tea procurement work, the tea factory has also decided to conduct key experiments on the "dual-track tea evaluation system" first, and then promote it after gaining experience. The problems of overly strict grading and inconsistent standards in mastering tea prices have also been basically resolved. As for the question of whether tea evaluation personnel should be temporarily hired, it is now under study.

### 湖南省茶业公司已检查纠正安化茶厂收购工作中的缺点

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    湖南省茶业公司已检查纠正安化茶厂收购工作中的缺点
    湖南省人民政府财经委员会来信：六月七日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了读者批评我省安化茶厂茶叶收购工作中缺点的来信后，我们就责成中国茶业公司湖南省公司负责检查处理。现在把该公司经理李振华到现场进行检查的结果写在下面：
    安化县茶叶收购工作中的确有混乱现象。该县收购茶叶的手续过于繁复。“双规制”本是评茶的先进办法，中国茶业公司中南区公司布置了这项办法后，省公司没有根据本省具体情况研究切实可行的执行办法；而茶厂却错误地将茶叶的五级十四等化成了一千二百五十个价格（实际上绝大多数价格是用不着的），使“双规制”变得复杂而神秘化了。因此，收购站的茶叶成交件数大大减少；不少茶农等了好几天才将茶卖出，耽误了春耕生产。在评定茶级方面，部分收购员要求过严，把很多可以收的茶叶也拒收了。在茶叶价格方面，省公司所订价格基本上能保证茶农有适当利润；但该县评茶人员掌握茶价忽高忽低，各收购站间标准不一，有一部分茶叶的价格的确评得过低。以上情况，都损害了茶农的利益，使茶农很不满意。
    上述情况之所以产生，除了上级公司今年收购计划一再变更、茶价和标准样茶下达过迟外，主要原因是：省公司布置工作不够具体，交代政策不明确、不全面（片面强调了提高茶叶品质，没有着重交代和切实掌握保障茶农利益的原则），发现问题后处理又不及时；茶厂领导干部对政策和业务不认真研究，对群众生活不够关心。此外，评茶人员都是临时雇用的，厂方对他们教育不够；因此有些评茶人员工作态度就很差。这也是一个应该解决的问题。
    现在省公司和茶厂已检查了上述错误，茶厂除已加强对茶叶收购工作的领导外，并决定把“双轨评茶制”先作重点试验，取得经验后再行推广，评级过严及掌握茶价标准不一的问题也已基本解决。至于评茶人员应否临时雇用的问题，现在正在研究中。
