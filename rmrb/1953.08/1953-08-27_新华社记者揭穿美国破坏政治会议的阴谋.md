　　Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter comments on the unreasonable demands of the American government regarding the political conference issue: After the governments of China and North Korea successively issued statements on August 24th and August 25th, putting forward various clear proposals that the political conference should take the form of a round table conference, the American government continues to stubbornly reject this format. It is also doing its utmost in the United Nations General Assembly to win over a small number of countries to obstruct India from participating in the political conference, thwarting the reasonable desire to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. This attitude and action of the American government cannot but make people deeply suspicious of its sincerity in convening the political conference.

　　The political conference should take the form of a round table conference, allowing other relevant countries besides the two sides of the Korean armistice to participate. This is supported by the majority of countries in the world. Because only in this way can the political conference proceed in a relatively relaxed and more easily coordinated situation, creating a good start for resolving international disputes through peaceful negotiation. If the political conference can only be attended by the two sides of the armistice, and other relevant countries, including India, are not allowed to contribute their efforts, then the harmonious atmosphere that the political conference should have will be replaced by the hostile situation of the two sides. The result is very likely to repeat the stalemate situation that occurred several times in the Panmunjom meetings. This situation is of course unfavorable to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to easing international tensions. At the same time, it is also disapproved by the vast majority of countries in the world. If the American government did not have prior consultation with the South Korean Syngman Rhee government, and deliberately sabotage the political conference, preventing the Korean issue from being resolved peacefully, it would not so arbitrarily reject the round table conference format and reject India's participation in the political conference.

　　What reasons does the American government have to insist that the political conference can only be attended by the two sides of the armistice? One of the reasons for its insistence is that if the political conference becomes a round table conference instead of separate negotiations between the two sides, it will cancel the veto power of the South Korean Syngman Rhee government. This is completely unfounded, because the statements of the Chinese and North Korean governments have clearly pointed out that any resolution of the political conference must be agreed upon by both sides of the Korean armistice before it can be established. Therefore, the American reason is without basis, unless the Syngman Rhee government declares itself to be outside the two sides of the Korean armistice, or it declares that it will not participate in the political conference. If either of these is the case, then the world can see very clearly that the Syngman Rhee government's purpose is not to seek a consensus agreement at the political conference, but precisely to sabotage the armistice, sabotage the political conference, prevent the Korean issue from being resolved peacefully, so as to further drag other countries into the war again. If the Syngman Rhee government does not consider itself outside the two sides of the Korean armistice, and if it participates in the political conference, then the statements of the Chinese and North Korean governments have already dispelled the American claim that the Syngman Rhee government's veto power has been cancelled.

　　The American government also says that the round table conference format limits the number of countries on the United Nations forces side that can attend the political conference. This is actually also a pretext. The Chinese government's statement has clearly stated that any country that participated in the war in Korea as part of the United Nations forces can be considered as a party to the armistice to attend the meeting. The Korean government has also expressed its complete agreement with this. The United States has no reason to use this as an excuse to resist the round table conference.

　　Another reason for the American government is that it fears that the agenda of the political conference will be expanded to include other Far Eastern issues, because this is detrimental to its attempt to maintain international tensions. However, the statements of the Chinese and North Korean governments have pointed out that the scope of authority of the political conference should be to first negotiate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, including the United Nations forces and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and then discuss other issues. In this way, troop withdrawal and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue are the first issues that the political conference must resolve, which is very clear, and the vast majority of countries agree with our position. The American government's excuse that other countries want to discuss Far Eastern issues in order to restrict other relevant countries from participating can only expose that it is unwilling to convene a political conference and is unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

　　In fact, if the political conference can be attended by relevant countries other than the two sides of the Korean armistice, it can pool wisdom and ideas and develop the spirit of consultation, which is beneficial to the conference. Therefore, if relevant countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America express their willingness to participate in the political conference out of concern for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, they should all have the opportunity to contribute their efforts to the cause of peace in this conference.

### 新华社记者揭穿美国破坏政治会议的阴谋

    新华社记者揭穿美国破坏政治会议的阴谋
    【新华社二十六日讯】新华社记者评美国政府在政治会议问题上的无理主张：在中朝两国政府于八月二十四日、八月二十五日先后发表声明，提出了政治会议应采取圆桌会议形式的各种明确主张之后，美国政府还是继续专断地拒绝这个形式，并在联合国大会中极力拉拢少数国家来阻挠印度参加政治会议，致力于和平解决朝鲜问题的合理愿望。美国政府这种态度和行动，使人们不能不深深怀疑它对于召开政治会议问题上的诚意。
    政治会议应该采取圆桌会议的形式，使除了朝鲜停战双方以外的其他有关国家都能参加，这是世界上多数国家都赞成的。因为只有这样，才能使政治会议在较为缓和、较易协调的局面下进行，来创造一个以和平协商方式解决国际纠纷的良好开端。如果政治会议只能由停战双方参加，不许其他有关国家、包括印度来尽一份力量，那么，政治会议应有的和谐空气就会为双方的敌对状况所代替。其结果极有可能重复板门店会议中几度僵持的局面。而这种局面对于和平解决朝鲜问题缓和国际紧张局势当然是不利的。同时，它也是全世界大多数国家都不赞成的。美国政府如果不是与南朝鲜李承晚政府早有预谋，存心破坏政治会议，使朝鲜问题不得和平解决，就不会这样武断地拒绝圆桌会议形式，拒绝印度参加政治会议的办法。
    美国政府究竟有什么理由来坚持政治会议只能由停战双方参加呢？它这样坚持的理由之一，是说政治会议如果成为圆桌会议而不是双方单独谈判，就会取消南朝鲜李承晚政府的否决权。这完全是无的放矢，因为中朝两国政府的声明已经明白指出：政治会议的任何决议必须得到朝鲜停战双方的一致同意，才能成立。因此，美国的理由是没有根据的，除非李承晚政府声明自居于朝鲜停战双方之外，或者它声明不参加政治会议。如果二者之中有其一，那么世人都可以看得很清楚，李承晚政府的目的并不是要求在政治会议中谋取一致协议，而恰恰是破坏停战，破坏政治会议，使朝鲜问题不得和平解决，以便进一步把其他国家再度拖入战争。假如李承晚政府不自居于朝鲜停战双方之外，假如它参加政治会议，那么，中朝两国政府的声明，早已解除了美方所谓取消了李承晚政府否决权的理由了。
    美国政府又说圆桌会议的形式限制了联合国军方面出席政治会议的国家的数目。这其实也是一种遁辞。中国政府的声明已经明确说明：凡以军队参加联合国军在朝鲜进行战争的国家，可被考虑作为停战的一方参加会议。朝鲜政府对此也已表示完全同意。美国再没有理由以此作为藉口来抵制圆桌会议了。
    美国政府的另一理由是害怕政治会议的议程会因此而扩大，以致包括其他远东问题，因为这对于它保持国际紧张局势的企图是不利的。但是中朝两国政府的声明已经指出：政治会议的职权范围，应该是先行协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，包括联合国军及中国人民志愿军在内，及和平解决朝鲜问题，然后再谈其他问题。这样，撤兵及和平解决朝鲜问题是政治会议首先要解决的问题就已经很明确了，绝大多数的国家都赞成我方这一主张。美国政府藉口其他国家要讨论远东问题而限制其他有关国家参加，只能暴露它自己是不愿召开政治会议，不愿和平解决朝鲜问题的。
    事实上，如果政治会议能有除朝鲜停战双方之外的有关国家参加，就能够集思广益而发挥协商精神，这是于会议有好处的。因此，如果在亚洲的，在非洲中东的，在欧洲的以及在拉丁美洲的有关国家为了对于和平解决朝鲜问题的关切而表示愿意参加政治会议，他们都应该有机会来在这个会议中为和平事业而贡献他们的力量。
