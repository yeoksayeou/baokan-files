First-Class Huai River Harnessing Labor Model Hu Yesheng
Congratulates the People's Liberation Army and Volunteers on the "August 1st" Army Day
    Hu Yesheng, a first-class labor model in harnessing the Huai River and formerly a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, sent a congratulatory letter to the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the eve of the 26th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day. The text is as follows: Dear comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers: Comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who defend the border and the coast:
    I am a worker participating in the Huai River harnessing project, my name is Hu Yesheng, and I am currently working in the mechanical team of the Foziling Reservoir in Anhui Province. As the glorious "August 1st" Army Day arrives, please allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you.
    The Huai River harnessing project has been underway for three years, with one to two million people from Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces participating in this great project each year. Over the past three years, the main channel and many tributaries of the Huai River have been initially straightened, and many mountain valley reservoirs and huge sluice gates controlling floods have been built on both sides of the Huai River. For example, the Baisha Reservoir in Henan Province, the Runheji Diversion Sluice in Anhui Province, the main irrigation canal in Jiangsu Province, and the Sanhe Sluice on the shore of Hongze Lake are all large-scale projects. Many other reservoir projects, such as the Foziling Reservoir, the Nanwan Reservoir, and the Boshan Reservoir, are under construction. Although the Huai River harnessing project has only been underway for three years, it can only be considered a beginning, but the face of the Huai River has undergone great changes. The floods of the Huai River have been initially controlled, and can no longer wreak havoc on the people as they did in the past. I would like to report good news to you: the autumn crops on both sides of the Huai River are growing very well, with sorghum, soybeans, and cotton everywhere.
    We all believe that participating in the Huai River harnessing project is a great honor. We constantly fight against difficulties in our work to ensure the success of the Huai River harnessing project. I was also a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Last year, I participated in the work of the Foziling Reservoir project and learned to be a lathe operator. After more than three months, I mastered the technology and was able to work beside the huge lathe. Once last year, I was assigned the arduous task of lathing drill rods. At that time, the construction site was in urgent need of drill rods, but our work efficiency was not high, and we could only lathe one drill rod every three hours. I was very anxious and tried to experiment with the Soviet advanced "multi-tool and multi-edge cutting method." After overcoming many difficulties, I finally succeeded in the experiment. I could lathe five drill rods per hour, which increased the work efficiency by fifteen times, thereby ensuring the needs of the project. At the Foziling Reservoir construction site, I was named a first-class labor model in harnessing the Huai River.
    Your heroic deeds constantly inspire us to move forward. When we encounter difficulties in our work on the construction site, as long as someone mentions "Learn from the fighting spirit of the Volunteers!" everyone immediately has a hundred times more courage in their work. For example, when I was experimenting with the "multi-tool and multi-edge cutting method," some people thought it might not succeed, and I also felt a little discouraged, but when I thought of you and saw the needs of the work, I immediately conducted the experiment with the greatest determination. Now we are still continuing to improve our work.
    Dear comrades! Although we are on the front of building the motherland, and you are on the front of defending the motherland, we have only one goal, which is to build our motherland. Let us join hands and fight for a common goal!

    一等治淮劳动模范胡业盛
    向解放军和志愿军祝贺“八一”建军节
    原来是中国人民解放军战士的一等治淮劳动模范胡业盛在“八一”建军节二十六周年前夕给中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军发出贺信，文如下：亲爱的中国人民志愿军同志们：保卫边防保卫海防的中国人民解放军同志们：
    我是参加治淮工程的一个工人，叫胡业盛，现在正在安徽省的佛子岭水库机械大队工作。当光荣的“八一”建军节到来的时候，让我衷心地向你们致以热烈的祝贺。
    治淮工程已进行三年了，河南、安徽、江苏三个省每年都有一二百万人参加这个伟大的工程。三年来淮河的干河和很多支河已经过初步整理，在淮河两岸很多控制洪水的山谷水库和巨大的水闸已经建筑起来。如河南省的白沙水库、安徽省的润河集分水闸、江苏省的灌溉总渠和洪泽湖边的三河闸都是规模很大的工程。其他很多水库工程，如佛子岭水库、南湾水库、薄山水库都正在施工。治淮工程虽然才有三年，只能算是开始，但淮河的面貌已发生很大变化，淮河的洪水已受到初步的控制，再也不能像过去那样横行直撞地危害人民了。我向你们报告个好消息：现在淮河两岸的秋庄稼长得很好，到处是高粱、黄豆和棉花。
    我们都认为参加治淮工程是很大的光荣，我们在工作中不断与困难战斗，保证做好治淮工程。我也曾经是中国人民解放军的一个战士，去年我参加了佛子岭水库工程的工作，学习作车工。前后经过三个多月，我就初步掌握了技术，能够站在巨大的车床旁边工作了。去年有一次我曾担任车钻杆的繁重任务，当时工地急等钻杆用，但是我们的工作效率却不高，每三个钟头只能车好一根钻杆。我心里十分着急，就想法试验苏联先进的“多刀多刃切削法”，克服许多困难，终于试验成功了，每个钟头可以车好五根钻杆，一下子把工作效率提高了十五倍，因而保证了工程的需要。在佛子岭水库工地上，我被评为一等治淮劳动模范。
    你们的英雄事迹经常鼓舞我们前进，在我们工地上工作遇到困难时，只要有谁一提起“学习志愿军的战斗精神吧！”大家在工作中就立即勇气百倍。例如我在试验“多刀多刃切削法”时，有些人认为不一定能成功，我也有些松劲，但我一想起你们，又看到工作的需要，立即以最大的决心进行试验。现在我们还正在继续改进我们的工作。
    亲爱的同志们！虽然我们在建设祖国的战线上，你们在保卫祖国的战线上，但我们的目标只有一个，就是为了建设我们的祖国，让我们拉起手来为共同的目标而战斗吧！
    佛子岭水库一等治淮劳动模范  胡业盛
    七月二十五日
