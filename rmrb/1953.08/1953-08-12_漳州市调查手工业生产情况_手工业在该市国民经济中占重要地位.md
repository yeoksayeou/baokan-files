    Zhangzhou City People's Government in Fujian Province recently investigated the status of handicraft production in the city. According to the investigated materials, the handicraft economy occupies an important position in the current national economy of Zhangzhou City.
    Zhangzhou City has a total of 1,559 handicraft households (excluding handicraft production cooperatives and more than ten individually scattered households such as embroidery shops), accounting for 56 percent of the total number of private industrial and commercial households in the city. The number of people engaged in handicrafts is 5,815 (excluding members of handicraft production cooperatives and migrant workers), accounting for approximately 60 percent of the number of people engaged in private industry and commerce. In 1952, the total value of handicraft production in Zhangzhou City reached 80 billion yuan, accounting for approximately 90 percent of the city's total industrial and agricultural output value.
    The city's thirteen handicraft trade associations and directly affiliated groups can be divided into 54 types according to product type. Among them, there are three industries with about 500 households producing or repairing fishing and agricultural production tools such as hoes, plows, awning, sickles, rakes, waterwheels, wooden carrying poles, hemp, and bamboo products. There are more than 300 households engaged in processing agricultural products and local specialties, such as sugar making, rice milling, and mills. There are about seven industries with more than 400 households supplying daily necessities for the vast urban and rural population, such as homespun cloth, towels, leather and fur, glass, ceramics, stationery, and supplying basic construction needs such as shell ash. In addition, there are about 200 households in service-oriented industries such as sewing. As for industries with little relevance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, or non-essential consumer goods industries such as superstitious items and decorative stone powder, there are less than 100 households. This shows that the vast majority (more than 95 percent) of handicraft products are closely related to the production in vast rural and fishing areas and the economic life of urban and rural people. Except for a few, most of these products cannot be replaced by machine-made products in a fairly long period of time in the future.
    Zhangzhou City's handicraft products are mainly supplied to the urban area and the surrounding rural areas, but many products also supply the needs of various counties in the Longxi Special District and even other regions and provinces. For example, vermilion is sold to Tianjin, Beijing, Jinjiang, Xiamen and other places, and most of the sugar is also transported to Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Other products such as candied fruit, homespun cloth, towels, canned condensed milk, local tobacco, hemp ropes, and wooden carrying poles are sold to counties in the Jinjiang Special District and Xiamen City, accounting for about one-third or more, in addition to the counties in the Longxi Special District.

    漳州市调查手工业生产情况
    手工业在该市国民经济中占重要地位
    福建省漳州市人民政府最近调查了全市手工业生产的情况。从调查的材料来看，手工业经济在漳州市当前国民经济中占有重要的地位。
    漳州市共有各种手工业一千五百五十九户（不包括手工业生产合作社和个别分散户如绣花店等十多家在内），占全市私营工商业总户数百分之五十六。手工业从业人数有五千八百十五人（不包括手工业生产合作社社员和流动工人在内），占私营工商业从业人数约百分之六十。一九五二年漳州市手工业生产总值达八百亿元，占全市工农业生产总值百分之九十左右。
    全市十三个手工业同业委员会及直属组，按产品类型可分为五十四种。其中属于产制或修理渔业、农业生产工具的如锄、犁、船篷、镰刀、耙、水车、木挑、麻、竹器等的共有三个行业约五百多户。属于加工制造农产品、土特产品的有制糖、碾米、磨坊等三百多户。属于供应广大城乡人民日常生活必需品的如土布、毛巾、皮革皮毛、玻璃、陶瓷、文教用品和供应基本建设需要的如壳灰等共约七个行业四百多户。另外，还有带有服务性质的缝纫等行业约二百多户。至于与国计民生关系不大的或非必要的消费品行业如迷信品和装饰用的石粉等则不上一百户。这说明了绝大部分（占百分之九十五以上）的手工业产品和广大农村、渔区的生产及城乡人民经济生活有着极其密切的关系。而这些产制品除个别的以外，绝大部分是在今后相当长的时期内还不可能被机器产品所代替的。
    漳州市手工业产品主要是供应市区及市郊一带农村，但有许多产品还供应龙溪专区各县甚至外区外省各地的需要，如银朱销到天津、北京及晋江、厦门等地，糖也大部分运销到江苏、浙江一带，其他如蜜果、土布、毛巾、罐头炼乳、土烟、麻索、木扁挑等销售地区除龙溪专区各县外，约有三分之一以上是销到晋江专区各县和厦门市的。
