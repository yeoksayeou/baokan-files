To create a tense atmosphere, the warmongers do not give up any opportunity to fabricate rumors. The piles and piles of myths about the so-called "mistreatment" of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese side, concocted by the American propaganda machine over the past week, is just the latest example. In a New York dispatch on August 7, the Associated Press feigned surprise and said in a solemn tone that the "horror stories" from Korea were "shocking." There are indeed "horror stories" in Korea, and they are indeed so terrifying as to be "shocking," but to the misfortune of the warmongers, these "shocking" "horror stories" are precisely not from Biyang, Changcheng, and Manpo in northern Korea, but from Geoje Island, Jeju Island, Busan, Yongcho Island, and other places in southern Korea. Moreover, the sound of gunfire that creates "horror stories" in these places is even more "shocking" as the Korean War comes to an end. Obviously, what the warmongers are "horrified" and "shocked" by is not these "stories," because they can be said to be commonplace and accustomed to them.

The warmongers fear peace as much as owls fear the sun. Indeed, stories that make the warmongers "terrified" and "shocked" have also come from North Korea! Look! Batches of prisoners of war from the United States and its vassal states have returned through Panmunjom. These prisoners all looked "extremely healthy," "they look like students just returning from school," (Reuters British Camp 5th dispatch) Two prisoners of war named Stone and Massey told AP reporter Panton that the treatment given to them by the Korean and Chinese side was "the best treatment possible in such a place." One prisoner said he simply "couldn't bear to leave." However, American journalists, encouraged by the American military authorities, were certainly not willing to hear only this kind of material. In order to extract myths about "atrocities" from the prisoners, American journalists have indeed done their best to search and pick. According to AP reporter William Miller, an American reporter once asked an American prisoner of war named Chiginny "if he would like to say that he had been abused." To the "shock" of the American reporter, Chiginny replied, "No." So, a group of American reporters besieged him, "trying hard to get Chiginny to talk about possible abuse." Although Chiginny was somewhat "terrified" by the questioning, his answer was still the same as that of most of the interviewed prisoners of war: "He was treated very well." According to AP reporter Kennedy, when American reporters discovered that American prisoner of war Harlan had a lot of gray hair on his head, they went to ask Harlan if his hair had turned gray after being captured, as if they had found a treasure. Harlan's answer once again made the American reporters "shocked." He said: his hair had already started to turn gray before he was captured.

The butchers with their hands dripping with blood originally intended to take this opportunity to write a few articles to achieve their despicable purpose of covering up their own mistreatment of our prisoners of war and deliberately discrediting the Korean and Chinese side; but reality was so ruthless that their despicable purpose could not be achieved. Of course, the warmongers did not give up on this. Reversing black and white and spreading rumors are their usual tricks. So, one rumor after another followed. Having started, they had to finish. Following the rumors of the American propaganda communication agency, Dulles also ran from behind the scenes to the front stage to personally act in this unpopular farce that received no applause but only sneers. In a press conference in Denver on August 10, Dulles openly admitted that the US side had forcibly detained a "large number" of our prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation, and said shamelessly that if the Korean and Chinese side did not agree to his unreasonable demands, Dulles said: "We will probably have to take retaliatory measures against the prisoners we have detained." After making such a big detour, it turned out that he was still looking for an excuse to continue to detain and mistreat our prisoners of war. This is how the butcher's face is exposed despite attempts to hide it.

The butchers who never let the word "humanitarianism" leave their mouths not only want to take so-called "retaliatory measures" against our prisoners of war, but also want to take "retaliatory measures" against the American prisoners of war who told the truth about our prisoner-of-war camps. According to AP reporter Kendrick: the repatriated American prisoners of war have been warned not to "talk about anything casually"; Clark even threatened these "American children" saying: if anyone talks about anything, it "may ruin his reputation, his family, and his future." This is completely a fascist face.

It is worth noting that these rumors fabricated by the warmongers using the prisoner-of-war issue, in addition to being despicable and rogue, also hide a more sinister purpose, which is to use this as an excuse to sabotage the political conference. The AP dispatch on August 7 could not help but betray itself after clamoring for a while about "terror" and "shock." The dispatch said: In this way, the US side is unlikely to have the "mood" to negotiate at the political conference.

    谎言掩盖下的阴谋
    萧羽
    为了制造紧张空气，战争贩子是不放弃一切造谣机会的。一周以来美国宣传机器编制的关于所谓朝中方面“虐待”战俘的一堆一堆的神话，不过是最近的一个例子而已。合众社在八月七日纽约电讯中故作惊人之态，煞有介事似地说：从朝鲜传来的“恐怖故事”是“令人震惊”的。朝鲜的确有“恐怖故事”，也的确恐怖到“令人震惊”的程度，但使战争贩子倒霉的是这些“令人震惊”的“恐怖故事”恰恰不是来自朝鲜北部的碧潼、昌城、满浦，而正是来自朝鲜南部巨济岛、济州岛、釜山、龙草岛等地，而且这些地方制造“恐怖故事”的枪声随着朝鲜战火的熄灭，响得更加“令人震惊”了。显然，战争贩子们“恐怖”的和“震惊”的不会是这些“故事”，因为这对他们可以说是司空见惯和习以为常了。
    战争贩子害怕和平正和猫头鹰害怕阳光一样。从北朝鲜也的确传来了使战争贩子们“恐怖”和“震惊”的故事，看吧！美国和他的仆从国家的俘虏经过板门店一批一批地回去了。这些俘虏看上去都是“极健康的样子”，“他们很像刚从学校里回家的学生”，（路透社不列颠营五日电）两个叫做斯通和麦赛的战俘对合众社记者潘顿说：朝中方面给他们的待遇是“在那样的地方可能得到的最好的待遇”。一位战俘说他简直“舍不得走”。可是，在美国军事当局鼓励之下的美国新闻记者，当然不甘心只听到这类材料。为了从俘虏们身上榨取关于“暴行”的神话，美国记者们的确尽了搜罗抉剔的能事。据合众社记者威廉米勒透露，一个美国记者曾经问一个名叫奇金尼的美国战俘，“是否愿说他受过虐待”，奇金尼却使美国记者“震惊”地答道：“不愿意”，于是一群美国记者围攻似地“竭力要奇金尼谈论可能的虐待情况”，尽管奇金尼被逼问得有些“恐怖”但他的回答依然和大多数被访问的战俘一样“他所受的待遇很好”。另据合众社记者肯尼迪透露，当美国记者发现了美国战俘哈兰的头上有不少灰白头发时，就如获至宝似地去问哈兰的头发是否被俘以后才发白的，哈兰的回答又使美国记者为之
    “震惊”了，他说：他的头发在被俘以前已经开始灰白了。
    满手血淋淋的屠夫们，原来打算借这个机会大做几篇文章的，以达到他们掩盖自己虐待我方战俘蓄意污蔑朝中方面的卑鄙目的；但现实竟然如此无情，使他们的卑鄙目的不能达到。当然，战争贩子们也并没有就此罢手。颠倒黑白、播弄是非是他们的惯技。于是一通一通的谣言仍然随之而至了。一不做，二不休，跟着美国御用通讯社的谣言之后，杜勒斯也从后台跑到前台，亲自串演这场没有喝彩、只有嗤笑的不受观众欢迎的滑稽剧了。杜勒斯八月十日在丹佛的记者招待会上发表谈话，公开承认美方已经强迫扣留了“大量”坚持遣返的我方战俘，并且无赖地说，如果朝中方面不答应他的无理取闹的话，杜勒斯说：
    “我们大概会要在我们所扣留的俘虏身上采取报复的措施”。拐了这样一个大弯儿，原来还是为了继续扣留和虐待我方战俘找寻藉口。屠夫的面目就是这样欲盖弥彰的。
    口上不离“人道主义”的屠夫们，不但要对我方战俘采取所谓“报复措施”，同时也要对说了我方战俘营真情实况的美方战俘采取“报复措施”。据合众社记者肯德里克报道：被遣返的美方战俘已受到了警告，不准“随便谈什么”；克拉克更恐吓这些“美国的孩子们”说：如果谁要谈了什么，“可能毁坏了他的名誉、他的家庭和他的前途”。这完全是一副法西斯的嘴脸了。
    值得注意的是，战争贩子借着战俘问题捏造的这些谣言，除过卑鄙、无赖，还隐藏着更阴险的目的，这就是以此作为破坏政治会议的一种藉口。合众社八月七日的电讯中在叫嚣了一阵“恐怖”“震惊”之后就不打自招起来。该电讯说：这样，美方已不可能有“心情”在政治会议上协商了。
