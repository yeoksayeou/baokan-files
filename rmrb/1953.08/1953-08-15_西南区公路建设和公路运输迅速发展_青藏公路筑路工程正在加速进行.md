    Highway construction and highway transportation in the Southwest region are developing day by day. Major trunk lines such as the Kangding-Tibet Highway continue to extend across the Kang-Tibet Plateau, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and northwestern Sichuan. Fourteen branch lines, totaling over a thousand kilometers in length and distributed throughout the Southwest provinces, are also being restored and newly constructed. Those projects carried over from 1952 have been basically completed, and those started this year will soon be finished. By June of this year, the total length of highways open to traffic in the entire region had reached more than 16,500 kilometers. In addition, survey work is underway on over a thousand kilometers of new routes.

    These newly built highways have many benefits for the lives of the people and the economic construction of the country in the Southwest region. The newly built Si(nan)-Tong(ren) Road branch line in Guizhou connects the Wu River and the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway, enabling the transportation of large quantities of grain from the Jiangkou area of northeastern Guizhou, which was previously impossible to transport out. The Da(ding)-Pu(ding) Road and Hui(shui)-Luo(dian) Road, which pass through ethnic minority areas, will transport large quantities of salt and daily necessities to the ethnic minority people in these areas. After the completion of the branch highways in Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces, the equipment and materials needed by many resource exploration teams and basic construction sites can be supplied more quickly and fully.

    With the start of national construction and the improvement of people's living standards, the volume of highway transportation in the Southwest region is also increasing day by day. From January to April of this year, the average monthly transportation volume on highways throughout the Southwest increased by 82.21 percent compared to the average monthly transportation volume last year. The average transportation volume in May and June of this year increased by more than 10 percent compared to the average transportation volume from January to April. In addition to the continued increase in grain and local specialties, the transportation of basic construction equipment, machinery, and daily necessities has greatly increased compared to the past. For example, Yunnan Province has a large basic construction task this year, and much of the equipment transported from other regions to support Yunnan's construction is transshipped through Guizhou. Therefore, the average transportation volume on highways throughout Guizhou Province from January to April of this year increased by more than double compared to the average monthly transportation volume last year.

    The Qinghai-Tibet Highway construction project is being accelerated. This year, the Qinghai-Tibet Highway construction section extends 595 kilometers from south of Xining to Chala Ping, the highest point of the Bayan Har Mountains. Since construction began in May, more than 130,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work have been completed. It is estimated that all of this year's projects will be completed in September.

    The section of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway from the Yellow River along the Bayan Har Mountains to Chala Ping is the focus of this year's construction and is particularly arduous. It must pass through several desert areas and swampy areas. Bridges must be built over the Yellow River and the Dahei River. The highest point of the Bayan Har Mountains is 4,950 meters above sea level, where the air is thin and the temperature changes are unpredictable. At present, thousands of highway construction workers are fighting against nature along the entire line, braving strong winds and heavy rain. While the Yellow River was still frozen, bridge builders began building wooden pontoon bridges over the Yellow River. The wooden pontoon bridge has now been successfully built, and large quantities of materials have been transported to the construction site via the bridge. Workers repairing the swampy sections followed the suggestions of Soviet experts, removing several inches of thawed peat, blasting the unfrozen peat with explosives, and then transporting dry soil from one kilometer away to fill it. In the desert areas, workers transported stones from afar to pave the road surface. These natural obstacles are being overcome in this way. Recently, safety and hygiene campaigns have also been launched in each construction section. More than a thousand tents along the line have been cleaned up, and the food for each highway construction team has been improved, increasing the attendance rate from 60 percent in the early stages of construction to more than 80 percent. The labor efficiency of each construction section has also been significantly improved. At the beginning, each worker could only dig one cubic meter of soil, but now it has generally increased to three cubic meters, with a maximum of six cubic meters.

    西南区公路建设和公路运输迅速发展
    青藏公路筑路工程正在加速进行
    西南区的公路建设和公路运输专业正在一天天发展。主要干线如康藏公路等继续在康藏高原、云贵高原、四川西北部等地延伸着。分布在西南各省共长一千多公里的十四条支线也正在恢复和新建，其中属于一九五二年跨年度工程的，已经基本完成，今年动工的也快要完工了。到今年六月，全区已经通车的公路达到一万六千五百多公里。另外，有一千多公里新线路的勘测工作还在进行。
    这些新建的公路对西南人民的生活和国家的经济建设有许多好处。贵州新建支线思（南）铜（仁）路，把乌江和川黔公路连接起来，使贵州东北部江口一带过去无法运出的大批粮食能够运输出去；通过少数民族地区的大（定）普（定）路和惠（水）罗（甸）路，将给这一带的少数民族人民运进大量的食盐和日用百货。四川、云南等省的支线公路完工以后，许多资源勘探队和基本建设工地所需要的器材物资，就可比较迅速充分地得到接济。
    随着国家建设的开始和人民生活水平的提高，西南区公路的运输量也在一天天增加。今年一月到四月，全西南公路每月的平均运输量比去年每月平均运输量增加了百分之八十二点二一，今年五、六月份的平均运输量又比一月到四月的平均运输量增加了百分之十以上。所运输的物资，除了粮食和土特产继续有增加外，基本建设器材、机器和日用百货比过去大大增多。比如云南省内今年基本建设任务较大，从外区运来支援云南建设的器材，很多都经贵州转运，因此贵州全省公路今年一月到四月的平均运输量比去年每月平均运输量增加了一倍以上。

    青藏公路筑路工程正在加速地进行。今年青藏公路施工地段，北自西宁以南到巴颜喀喇山的最高处查拉坪，长达五百九十五公里。自五月份开工后，现在已完成了十三万多土石方的任务，预计九月份即可完成今年的全部工程。
    青藏公路从黄河沿到巴颜喀喇山查拉坪的一段是今年施工重点，工程特别艰巨，要通过几处沙漠地带和沮洳地，在黄河和大黑河上要架设桥梁，巴颜喀喇山最高处海拔四千九百五十公尺，空气稀薄，气温变化无常。目前数千名筑路职工正冒着狂风大雨，在全线和自然作斗争。还在黄河封冻的时候，架桥工人就开始在黄河上架设木便桥，现在木便桥已架设成功，大批物资已通过桥梁运往工地。修筑沮洳地段的职工们，依照苏联专家建议，将解冻了的泥炭层挖去几公寸，没有解冻的就用炸药爆炸，然后再从一公里外运来干土垫上；在沙漠地段，职工们从远处运来石块铺砌路面，这些自然障碍就这样被克服着。最近，各工段还开展安全卫生运动，沿线千余顶帐篷内收拾得干干净净，各筑路队的伙食也都有了改善，因而出勤率由施工初期的百分之六十提高到百分之八十以上。各工段的劳动效率也显著提高，某段开始时每工只能挖一方土，现在已普遍增到三方，最高达到六方。（新华社）
