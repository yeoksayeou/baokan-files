Establishing and Rectifying the Order of Factory and Mine Trade Union Work

During the period of national economic recovery, we carried out a series of reform movements in factories and mines; after these reforms, the production situation in factories and mines has greatly improved. However, it must be pointed out that many organizations, systems, and working methods—the entire order—during the enterprise reform period are unsuitable or not fully suitable for the requirements of the construction period and need to be changed.

To shift firmly from reform movements to production, and to firmly establish a normal production order, is the requirement that should be put forward to factories and mines at present.

Until now, the order in many factories and mines is still quite chaotic. Whenever a task is assigned, all the cadres from the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League rush forward without a proper "formation." Various meetings fill up after-work hours, and workers do not get adequate rest; cadres are even more overwhelmed; even production time is often encroached upon; and model workers do not have time to produce. All of these are very abnormal and must be changed.

In order to change this abnormal situation and ensure that the work of factories and mines is effectively shifted to production, many factories and mines have begun to implement planned management and responsibility systems, which is a key issue in production management and a very important measure for establishing production order. This measure has achieved remarkable results in many factories and mines, and their experience is worth paying close attention to and learning from.

Establishing a normal enterprise management order is the key to establishing a normal production order, but without the corresponding cooperation of the Party, trade union, and Youth League, the harmonious order of the entire enterprise cannot be established, and chaotic phenomena cannot be overcome. In particular, whether the work order of the trade union is normal or not has a significant impact on the entire work of factories and mines. Therefore, improving trade union work and establishing a normal order for trade union work are equally important as implementing planned management and responsibility systems.

So, how should the trade union establish its own work order?

First, the trade union must establish its organization, determine its systems, and carry out its work in accordance with the needs of production and the needs of the masses. It must eliminate as much as possible those things that are irrelevant to production and irrelevant to the masses. It must never regard promoting prize-winning savings, selling melon seeds, distributing theater tickets, etc., as the trade union's business. The main business of the trade union should be to tirelessly educate the masses, give play to the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, improve labor productivity, reduce product costs, and, on the basis of production development, strive to improve the material and cultural life of the masses according to the principles of need and possibility. Many grassroots trade union organizations spend most of their energy "coping" with some "errands" that are not urgent, so that the work is unusually hard, but the results are very small, and they are divorced from the masses. This situation urgently needs to be changed.

Second, most of the workers' spare time must be controlled by the workers themselves and should not be arbitrarily occupied. Only in this way can the workers gain adequate rest and make it possible for them to use their spare time to meet their own different cultural needs. Of course, this does not mean that the trade union can ignore the workers' spare time activities. On the contrary, the trade union must pay close attention to this work. However, the trade union should not force the workers to participate in any after-work activities, but should attract the masses to participate in various activities through their own work. The trade union should organize various after-work schools, lectures, technical performances, art activities, sports activities, speeches, etc. As long as these tasks are done well, the masses will be happy to participate; if the masses do not participate, it is a criticism of our work by the masses, and we should improve our work. If we do these tasks well, a vigorous atmosphere will surely appear in factories and mines.

A small portion of after-work hours can also be used as time for Party, government, trade union, and Youth League activities, and used to hold necessary meetings. But this part of the time must be strictly limited.

The current method of the leadership controlling all the workers' spare time must be gradually changed.

Third, the organizational form of grassroots trade unions must be rectified. Unnecessary committees should be abolished, and organizations that can be merged should be merged. We must strengthen the organization for managing labor competitions and the organization for managing the masses' livelihood problems; strengthen the organization for conducting mass political, cultural, and technical education and the organization for managing trade union organizational work. We must establish organizations and stipulate systems according to needs, and constantly seek improvement in our work, oppose formalism and reversing the order of importance.

Too many concurrent positions for cadres is also a problem in factories and mines at present. The more concurrent positions there are, the more meetings there are, and the less able they are to concentrate their energy on the main work. Therefore, the problem of concurrent positions should also be solved.

Fourth, we must strengthen the work of trade union groups. All the work of the trade union must be realized through the trade union groups. Without strengthening the work of the groups, we cannot well concentrate the opinions of the masses, cannot well give play to the strength of the masses, the grassroots trade union will be divorced from the masses, and the work will certainly not be done well.

We now have many model trade union groups, and their experience should be disseminated.

After the democratic reform and the "Three-Anti" movement, there was a situation in which enterprise management lagged behind the production enthusiasm of the masses. This situation still exists today. However, when the planned management and responsibility system of the enterprise is realized, the situation where the mass work lags behind the management work is very likely to occur again, which is equally detrimental to production. Therefore, when promoting the planned management and responsibility system, we must also pay attention to improving trade union work and establishing and rectifying the work order of the trade union. Trade union organizations at all levels must, under the leadership of the Party, actively improve their own work according to their own actual situation and do their work well.

### 建立和整顿厂矿工会工作的秩序

    建立和整顿厂矿工会工作的秩序
    在国民经济的恢复时期，我们在厂矿企业中进行了一系列的改革运动；经过了这些改革工作，厂矿企业的生产状况有了很大的改进。但是必须指出，在企业改革时期的许多组织、制度和工作方法——整个的秩序是不适合或不完全适合于建设时期的要求的，是需要加以改变的。
    由改革运动切实转向生产，把正常的生产秩序切实建立起来，这是目前应该向厂矿企业提出的要求。
    直到现在，许多厂矿企业中的秩序还是相当乱的。当每一件工作布置之后，总是党、政、工、团所有干部一拥而上，没有一个适当的“阵势”。各种会议占满了业余时间，职工得不到适当的休息；干部更是忙得不可开交；甚至生产时间也常常受到侵犯；劳动模范没有时间进行生产。所有这些，都是很不正常的，是必须加以改变的。
    为了改变这种不正常的情况，使厂矿企业的工作切实转到生产上来，许多厂矿企业已经开始实行计划管理和责任制度，这是生产管理上的关键问题，是建立生产秩序的极重要的措施。这一措施在许多厂矿已经取得了显著的成绩，他们的经验是值得密切注意和学习的。
    建立正常的企业管理秩序是建立正常的生产秩序的关键，但是如果没有党的、工会的和青年团的相应的配合，整个企业的和谐的秩序还是建立不起来的，混乱的现象还是不可能克服的。特别是工会的工作秩序的正常与否，对于厂矿企业的整个工作是有重大影响的。所以改进工会工作，建立工会工作的正常秩序，和实行计划管理、责任制度是同等重要的。
    那么工会应当怎样来建立自己的工作秩序呢？
    第一，工会必须按照生产的需要和群众的需要来建立组织、确定制度、进行工作。必须把那些与生产无关、与群众无关的事情尽量地排除开。绝不能把推销有奖储蓄、推销瓜子、分配戏票等等工作作为工会的业务。工会的主要业务应该是不疲倦地教育群众，发挥群众的劳动热情和创造精神，提高劳动生产率，降低产品成本，并在生产发展的基础上，根据需要和可能的原则，努力改善群众的物质生活和文化生活。有许多工会的基层组织，把大部分精力消耗在“应付”一些不是当务之急的“差事”上去，以致工作异常辛苦而成绩却很微小，并且脱离群众。这种情况是亟应加以改变的。
    第二，职工的业余时间的大部分必须由职工自己来支配，不应任意占用。只有这样，才能使职工群众获得适当的休息，并使他们有可能利用业余时间来满足他们自己不同的文化要求。当然这绝不是说工会可以不关心职工的业余活动，相反的，工会要十分关心这项工作。不过工会不应该强迫职工群众来参加任何业余活动，而是要以自己的工作来吸引群众参加各种活动。工会应该举办各种业余学校、讲座、技术表演、艺术活动、体育活动、讲演会等等。这些工作只要作得好，群众是会乐意参加的；群众不参加，就是群众对于我们工作的批评，就应该改进我们的工作。如果我们作好了这些工作，在厂矿企业中一定会出现一种蓬蓬勃勃的气象。
    业余时间的少部分，还可以做为党、政、工、团活动的时间，用以召开必要的会议。可是这一部分时间必须受到严格的限制。
    目前由领导方面支配职工全部业余时间的办法必须逐步改变。
    第三，基层工会的组织形式必须加以整顿，不必要的委员会应该取消，可以归并的组织应该加以归并。要加强管理劳动竞赛的组织和管理群众生活问题的组织；加强进行群众政治、文化、技术教育的组织和管理工会组织工作的组织。要按照需要来建立组织、规定制度，并在工作中不断地求得改进，反对形式主义和轻重倒置的作法。
    干部兼职太多，也是目前厂矿企业中的一个问题。兼职越多，会议就越多，就不能把精力集中在主要的工作上来。所以兼职的问题也应该加以解决。
    第四，要加强工会的小组工作。工会的无论什么工作，都是要通过工会小组来实现的。不加强小组工作，就不能很好地集中群众的意见，不能很好地发挥群众的力量，基层工会就要脱离群众，工作就一定做不好。
    我们现在已经有许多模范的工会小组，他们的经验是应该加以传播的。
    在民主改革和“三反”运动之后，曾经出现了一种情况，就是企业管理落后于群众的生产热情。这种情况今天依然存在。可是当企业的计划管理和责任制度实现之后，群众工作落后于管理工作的情况又很可能出现，这对于生产同样是不利的。所以在推行计划管理和责任制度的时候，必须同时注意改进工会工作，建立和整顿工会的工作秩序。工会各级组织必须在党的领导之下，根据自己的实际情况，积极地改进自己的工作，把自己的工作做好。
