Farmers in Mountainous Areas of Southwest China
Hunt Wild Animals to Protect Crops

    The Southwest region is mostly mountainous. In the border areas of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Xikang provinces, high mountains and dense forests mean wild animals pose a significant threat to agricultural production and animal husbandry. In Qingchuan County, Sichuan Province, there are as many as twenty-seven kinds of wild animals and harmful birds that frequently damage crops. In Maohe Township, Xinping County, Yunnan Province, about three hundred of the eight hundred lambs born each year are eaten by wild animals. Wild animals also seriously threaten the lives of people in mountainous areas. Farmers call wild animals "mountain despots" and urgently demand the elimination of these pests.

    In order to eliminate wild animals and protect farmers' production, various mountainous areas have actively carried out work to hunt and eliminate pests this year. Luoping, Lunan, and Xuanwei counties in Yunnan Province specifically convened meetings of hunter representatives. Qingchuan County, Sichuan Province, specifically investigated and studied the masses' experience and methods of hunting. The Xuyong County People's Government promptly allocated a large amount of funds to purchase gunpowder, distributed it to various townships, and organized hunting teams. The Xuanwei County People's Government in Yunnan Province distributed more than 900 stockpiled土枪 [homemade guns] and 1,500 jin [750 kg] of gunpowder to the masses. Cooperatives also actively purchased animal skins, helping the masses solve specific difficulties in hunting work. Under the call of "Kill one more beast, harvest one more dou [unit of dry measure, about 10 liters] of grain" and "Eliminate mountain despots, strive for a great harvest," farmers in mountainous areas have made great achievements in this year's "hunting and pest elimination" work. Since the beginning of this year, Qujing Prefecture in Yunnan Province has eliminated a total of 1,927 large and small wild animals such as leopards, wolves, wild boars, roe deer, bears, and mountain rats. In three months, Xuanwei County killed 1,619 large and small wild animals such as leopards, wolves, rock sheep, and foxes, and 23,473 harmful birds. According to statistics from Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, from early May to mid-June, three tigers, twelve leopards, one hundred and thirty-five wild boars, and seventy-six other wild animals were eliminated. In Maohai Township, Qingchuan County, Sichuan Province, farmers used the method of division of labor and mutual assistance to organize themselves to take turns guarding "passes." Many model figures have also emerged in the hunting effort. Now, farmers in mountainous areas not only have hunting experts who "hit nine out of ten times," but have also created methods for eliminating beasts such as setting hooks, building tree-houses, digging traps, setting up pole traps, laying snares, and using poison. Many farmers have mastered the habits of wild animals, effectively hunting them and playing a very important role in ensuring production in mountainous areas. This year, no sheep in Shuanghe Township, Jianchuan County, have been harmed by wild animals. (Xue Li)

    西南各地山区农民
    捕打野兽保卫庄稼
    西南地区多山，云南、贵州、四川、西康各省边缘地带，山高林大，野兽对农业生产和畜牧业的危害甚大。四川省青川县经常危害农作物的野兽和害鸟有二十七种之多。云南省新平县貌合乡每年生殖的八百只小羊，就要被野兽吃掉三百只左右。野兽也严重威胁着山区人民的生命安全。农民称野兽为“山恶霸”，迫切要求打兽除害。
    为消灭野兽保护农民生产，今年各地山区都积极开展了打兽除害工作。云南省罗平、路南、宣威等县专门召开了猎户代表会。四川省青川县专门调查研究了群众的打兽经验和办法。叙永县人民政府及时拨出了大批经费购买火药，分到各乡，并组织了打兽队。云南省宣威县人民政府将库存的土枪九百余支、火药一千五百斤，分发给群众；合作社并配合大力收购兽皮，帮助群众解决了打兽工作中的具体困难。在“多打一只兽，多收一斗粮”、“消灭山恶霸，争取大丰收”的号召下，山区农民在今年的“打兽除害”工作中做出了很大成绩。云南省曲靖专区今年以来共消灭豹、狼、野猪、獐、狗熊、山鼠等大小野兽一千九百二十七只。宣威县在三个月中，捕杀豹、狼、岩羊、狐狸等大小野兽一千六百一十九只，害鸟二万三千四百七十三只。四川省叙永县五月初至六月中旬的统计，消灭老虎三只、豹子十二只、野猪一百三十五只，及其他野兽七十六只。四川青川县毛害乡农民用分工互助的办法，组织起来轮流看守“道口”。打兽中也出现了不少的模范人物。现在山区农民，不仅有“十打九得”的打猎能手，并创造了安钩套、树关房、挖陷井、支夹杆、下扣子、放毒药等除兽办法。许多农民掌握了野兽活动的规律，有效地捕打野兽，对山区生产起了极重大的保证作用。剑川县双河乡今年羊群一只也没有受到野兽的损害。（雪犁）
