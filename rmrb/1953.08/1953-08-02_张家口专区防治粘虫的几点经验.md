In June of this year, armyworms occurred extensively in eleven counties including Yangyuan, Wei County, and Chicheng in our district. Leading organs at all levels fully led the masses to actively eliminate and control them. As of around July 10, the first generation of armyworms had been basically eliminated. In areas with better control, most of the armyworms were eliminated, and a small portion went into the soil to pupate.

The current temperature and rainfall are conducive to the reproduction of the second generation of armyworms. According to general rules, the second generation of armyworms is more harmful than the first generation, so it is necessary to summarize the experiences in eliminating the first generation of armyworms and strengthen preparations for preventing and controlling the second generation. The following are some of our experiences in eliminating armyworms this time:

(1) From this stage, we have deeply realized that it is very important for leading organs to attach great importance to and earnestly implement the pest control policy of "prevention is more important than treatment," "attack early, attack small, attack thoroughly," and "treat early, treat continuously, treat thoroughly." We did not do enough in this regard this time. At the beginning of June, the Shalingzi Farm submitted a forecast that armyworms were about to occur. Although the special district and county issued notices and made arrangements, due to insufficient understanding of the harmfulness of this pest, no specific organization and leadership work was carried out. Due to insufficient vigilance, armyworms had already grown to the third instar before hasty control measures were taken, resulting in the chaotic phenomenon in the initial stage of this pest control work. Although the rescue was good later, it had already caused some losses. Facts have proved that if attention is paid to control early, these losses can be avoided. For example, in Shalingzi Village, all 87 mu of wheat were eaten up by armyworms, but the wheat on the farm in this village was not damaged at all because it was controlled early.

Some areas ended the campaign too early, failing to meet the requirements of thorough control. For example, in the seventh and eighth districts of Xuanhua, there were still scattered insects in some fields, so the pest control work was ended. This not only allows the escaped pests to continue to be harmful, but also leaves hidden dangers because these insects have entered the soil to pupate.

(2) To do a good job in pest control, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses so that they can recognize the severity of the armyworm hazard and the necessity of thorough pest control. Only in this way can the masses actively and proactively carry out prevention and control.

To achieve this, it is first necessary to help the masses break down superstitious ideas, and to use readily available facts to educate the masses in light of these ideas in the process of pest control work. However, this work must be carried out regularly, continuously, and at any time and any place. For example, when moths are caught, the masses should be publicized; when egg masses and pupae are discovered, the masses should be publicized; the instar of the larvae should be told to the masses; and the good and bad examples of prevention and control should be introduced to the masses. In short, people, things, and events related to pest control should be used as teaching materials to continuously publicize and educate the masses, and the pest control process should be turned into a process of educating the masses. This time, some areas exhibited insect specimens, organized visits, and held pest control symposiums, which made the masses aware of the harm of armyworms and the importance of pest control, so the masses took active action. However, some areas did not pay attention to publicity and education work, and used methods of monopolization or coercion to force the masses to control pests, resulting in resistance from the masses. For example, in some areas, the masses were not seriously publicized and educated, and cadres of the agricultural department gave the masses agents in vain to ask the masses to control pests, but the masses were unwilling to even carry water for preparing the medicine.

When mobilizing the masses to control pests, the pest control work should be combined with the vital interests of the masses. Some areas have organized neighboring households in groups of three or five, or eight or ten, to help each other check for insects and kill insects, with very good results. When controlling pests in Zhuolu Chengguan, the households were organized, group leaders were selected, land plots were divided, and the price of labor was determined according to the amount of land, the use of agents, and the occupation of land by ditches were all based on the amount of land, and everyone shared the money fairly, which the masses were happy to accept. On the contrary, concentrating dozens or hundreds of people to control pests in one field, although the pest disaster was eliminated, the crops were also damaged, which would be opposed by the masses and create difficulties for the pest control work.

(3) Pest control must be adapted to local conditions, and the combined use of various methods should be advocated. This time, there are three main methods of pest control: spraying agents (generally suitable for cash crops), digging ditches for blockade, and manual capture. When using agents to eliminate and control, the agents should be appropriately prepared and applied according to the specific conditions such as the size of the insects and the type of crops. Some technical cadres did not prepare medicines according to the specific situation because they stuck to conventions, resulting in little effect. In carrying out ditching and blockade work, it is also necessary to proceed from reality. It should be determined according to the density of crops, the number of armyworms, and the effectiveness of chemical killing and capture. If the crops are too dense and chemical killing and manual capture are ineffective, ditches should be dug; if the crops are sparse and other methods are more effective, there is no need to dig ditches; if this land has insects and the neighboring land also has insects, ditches should be dug jointly in order to save labor and give full play to the effectiveness of ditching and killing insects; if this land has no insects and the neighboring land has insects, ditches should be dug for prevention and control. At the same time, the ditches dug must meet the standards, otherwise they will not be able to play the role of blocking and killing insects. In manual capture, manpower and tools should also be equipped according to the growth of crops and the number of insects.

    张家口专区防治粘虫的几点经验
    河北省张家口专员公署
    今年六月间，我区阳原、蔚县、赤城等十一县普遍发生了粘虫。各级领导机关全力领导群众积极除治，截至七月十日左右，第一代粘虫已基本肃清。其中除治较好地区，粘虫大部被消灭，小部入土化蛹。
    目前的气温和雨量是有利第二代粘虫繁殖的。按一般规律，第二代粘虫为害较第一代更严重，必须很好地总结除治第一代粘虫的经验，并加强防治第二代粘虫的准备工作。下面就是我们这次除治粘虫的几点经验：
    （一）从这一阶段中，我们深深体验到领导机关十分重视，认真贯彻“防重于治”，“打早、打小、打了”，“及早治、连续治、彻底治”的除虫方针是十分重要的。我们这次在这方面作的是不够的。六月初，沙岭子农场就提出了粘虫将要发生的预报，专区和县虽然发了通知，作了布置，但由于对这种虫害的危害性认识不足，竟没有进行具体的组织领导工作。由于警惕性不足，各地粘虫已经长到三龄，才仓忙除治，以致形成了这次治虫工作开始阶段的忙乱现象。后来虽然抢救的还好，但已经造成了一些损失。事实证明，如果及早注意除治，这些损失是能够避免的。例如沙岭子村全村共种八十七亩小麦，完全被粘虫把叶子吃光了，但在这个村的农场的小麦却因早下手防治，没有受到丝毫损失。
    有些地区因收兵过早，没有达到彻底除治的要求。例如宣化七、八区，有些地里还有零散的虫子，就结束了除虫工作。这样不但使漏网的害虫能继续为害，并且由于这些虫子已入土化蛹，又留下了后患。
    （二）要把除虫工作做好，必须充分发动群众，使群众认识到粘虫危害的严重性和彻底除虫的必要性。只有这样，群众才能积极地主动地进行防治。
    要做到这点，首先要帮助群众打破迷信思想，要在治虫工作的过程中，用现成的事实，针对这种思想向群众进行教育。但这一工作必须经常地、连续地、随时随地地去进行。例如捉到蛾子要向群众宣传，发现了卵块和虫蛹要向群众宣传，要把幼虫的虫龄告诉群众，要把防治好的事例和防治不好的事例向群众介绍，总之，要把除虫中有关的人、物、事都作为教材，不断向群众进行宣传教育，把除虫过程变成教育群众的过程。这次有些地区展览了虫子标本，组织了参观，召开了治虫座谈会，使群众认识了粘虫的危害性和治虫的重要，群众因而积极行动起来。但也有些地区不注意宣传教育工作，用包办代替或强迫命令的办法强制群众治虫，结果遭到了群众的抵抗。例如有的地区没有认真向群众进行宣传教育，农业部门的干部白给群众药剂叫群众除虫，群众连配药的水也不愿担。
    在发动群众治虫时，要使治虫工作和群众的切身利益结合起来。有些地区把相邻的地户三户五户、十户八户地组织起来，互助查虫，互助灭虫，成绩很好。涿鹿城关在治虫时把地户组织起来，选组长，划地片，并按地多少齐工找价，使用药剂，挖沟占地都按地摊钱，大家负担公平，群众乐于接受。相反，集中几十几百人到一块地去治虫，结果虫灾虽然消灭了，但庄稼也被损坏了，这样就会遭到群众反对，给治虫工作造成困难。
    （三）防治虫害必须因地制宜，并应提倡多种方法结合使用。这次除虫有三种主要方法：药剂喷洒
    （一般适宜于经济作物）、挖沟封锁和人工捕捉。使用药剂除治，应当随着虫子大小，作物种类等具体情况，适当配制和施用。有的技术干部由于墨守成规，不按具体情况配药，结果药效不大。在进行挖沟封锁工作中，也要从实际出发。要根据庄稼稠稀、粘虫多少和药杀捕捉有无效果而定。庄稼太稠、药杀和人工捕捉都无效的，就应当挖沟；如庄稼稀，用别的办法收效更大，就不必挖沟；如此地有虫，邻地也有，为了省工和发挥挖沟杀虫的效能，便应当联合挖沟；如此地无虫，邻地有虫，便应当挖沟防治。同时挖出来的沟必须合标准，否则就不能起到阻杀虫子的作用。在人工捕捉时也要根据庄稼的生长情况、虫子多少来配备人力和工具。
