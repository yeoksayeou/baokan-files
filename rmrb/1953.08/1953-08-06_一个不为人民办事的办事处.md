    An Office That Doesn't Serve the People
    Jiang Liu
    The Hai'ning County Chang'an Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Public Factory and Mining United Office sent a report to the provincial headquarters regarding the purchase of ramie. The report actually slandered the peasants as "playing rogue." What "rogue" did the peasants "play"? The report cited an example: Fu Zibin, a hemp farmer from Shengli Village, Gaomu Township, Yuanhua District (about seventy or eighty li from Chang'an), hired someone to carry over a hundred jin of ramie to sell. Because the ramie "did not meet specifications," the office refused to purchase it. Fu was extremely angry and threw the ramie into the river. Therefore, he was "playing rogue." Another lame, seventy-two-year-old farmer brought more than ten jin of hemp to sell from Huaguang Township, more than twenty li away, but was also refused purchase because it "did not meet specifications." The old farmer sat sighing, and did not leave until dusk. The report not only slandered this old farmer as "playing rogue," but also considered him to be "extremely rogue."
    Let us see how the Chang'an Office mastered the "specifications" of ramie. Jiang Guanfu, a farmer from Yiqiao Township, had eighty jin of ramie. The first time he went to sell it, it didn't even meet the lowest grade, "Extra Grade Two," so naturally it didn't meet the "specifications" and was not purchased. But after a while, when Jiang Guanfu took it to sell again, it not only suddenly met the "specifications," but also sold at "Extra Grade One." Chen Huilin, a farmer from Xinmin Township, had hemp from the same mu of land, and the quality was exactly the same. However, because it was sold in two batches, the second batch was downgraded two levels in "specifications" compared to the first. Zhou Zhengyuan and Ding Sanxing from Jin Village, Yiqiao Township, went to sell hemp together. After inspection, both "did not meet specifications." Later, the two of them switched their hemp and went to sell it again, and both met the "specifications." Some farmers said: "They don't have eyes when they inspect the hemp, it's simply a matter of luck!" Under such strange "specifications," more than four thousand dan of white hemp and nearly six hundred dan of raw hemp, worth more than ten billion yuan, were rejected for purchase in Hai'ning County, leaving many farmers with ramie piled up at home but unable to buy food. The production cost of ramie is very high. When farmers see that their hard work has become worthless waste due to a "specification" that is not convincing, they are anxious, they sigh, and they are angry. Is this "playing rogue"?
    What is the attitude of the staff of the Public Factory and Mining United Office towards these "rogue" hemp farmers? The report from the Chang'an Office said that they had "repeatedly mobilized and persuaded" and "tried their best to explain." Let's see how they mobilized, persuaded, or explained! According to Jiang Guanfu, a farmer who had sold hemp seven times: "Several times, my hemp pole had not even been lowered from my shoulder, and they glanced at it, kicked it with their feet: 'Take it away, it doesn't meet the specifications!'" Sometimes, in order to avoid "unqualified hemp being returned and sent back again," they splashed red water on the "unqualified" hemp to identify it. The farmers were extremely dissatisfied with this, saying: "If you don't buy it, then don't buy it, but you splash red water on the white hemp, who can I sell it to? It can't be eaten!" Some farmers were so angry that they threw the hemp splashed with red water into the river.
    The hemp farmers said: "Your office doesn't serve the people."
    I sincerely hope that the comrades in the office will change their management style, change their attitude towards the farmers, and truly do something for the people, and not spoil good things.

    一个不为人民办事的办事处
    江流
    浙江省公营厂矿联营处海宁县长安办事处给省总处送了一份关于收购络麻的报告。报告中竟然诬蔑农民“耍无赖”。农民“耍”了什么“无赖”呢？报告中举例说：袁花区皋木乡胜利村（距长安约有七八十里）麻农傅自彬，雇人挑了百余斤络麻来卖，因络麻“不合规格”，办事处拒不收购，傅气愤已极，将络麻扔到河里去了。因此是“耍无赖”。另一个跛脚的七十二岁的老农民，从二十多里外的华光乡带了十多斤麻来卖，也因为“不合规格”被拒绝收购。这个老农民坐着叹息，直到日暮还不走。报告中不仅诬蔑这个老农民“耍无赖”，而且认为简直是“无赖已极”了。
    让我们看看长安办事处是怎样掌握络麻的“规格”呢？伊桥乡农民蒋关甫八十斤络麻，第一次去卖，连最低级的“等外二”也够不上，自然不够“规格”不予收购。但停了一会儿，蒋关甫再拿去卖时，不但忽然合乎“规格”，而且还卖到了“等外一”。新民乡农民陈惠林同一亩地里的麻，品质完全一样，只因为分作两次卖，第二次就比第一次在“规格”上被降低了两级。伊桥乡金村的周正元和丁三兴同去卖麻，经检验都“不合规格”；后来他两人彼此对调了一下再去卖，却又都合“规格”了。有的农民说：“他们验麻那里有眼睛呀，简直是碰运气！”就在这样一些奇怪的“规格”下，海宁全县被拒绝收购的白麻达四千多担，生麻近六百担，价值十余亿元，使不少农民家里堆着络麻但不能买粮食。络麻的生产成本是很大的，当农民眼看着自己辛辛苦苦的劳动果实由于一个并不服人的“规格”而变成了一钱不值的废品时，他们着急，他们叹息，他们气愤，难道这是“耍无赖”么？
    公营厂矿联营处的工作人员对待这些“耍无赖”的麻农的态度又如何呢？长安办事处的报告中说是“一再动员说服”、“尽力解释”。我们看看他们是怎样动员、说服或解释的吧！据曾经卖过七次麻的农民蒋关甫说：“好几次我的麻担还没有歇下肩，他们拿眼睛瞟了一下，用脚一踢：‘挑走，不合规格’！”有时，该处为避免“不合规格的麻被退出去又送进来”，就在“不合规格”的麻上泼了红水，以资识别。农民对这一点极为不满，说：“不收就不收好了，你在白麻上泼上红水，我再拿去卖给谁呢？又不能当饭吃！”有的农民气愤得把泼了红水的麻摔到河里去了。
    麻农说：“你们这个办事处不是为人民办事的。”
    我诚恳地希望办事处的同志们改变经营作风，改变对待农民的态度，真正给人民办点事，不要把好事办坏了。
