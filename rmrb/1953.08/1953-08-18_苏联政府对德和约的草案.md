The war against Germany ended nearly seven years ago, but Germany still does not have a peace treaty, remains divided, and is in a position of inequality with other countries. This abnormal situation must be terminated. Ending this situation is entirely in line with the wishes of all peace-loving people. Failure to conclude a peace treaty with Germany at an early date also makes it impossible to ensure a just attitude towards the legitimate national interests of the German people.

The conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is of paramount importance for consolidating peace in Europe. After the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, it will be possible to finally resolve the various problems arising from World War II. Resolving these problems is of vital interest to all European countries that have suffered from Hitler's aggression, especially Germany's neighbors. The conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany will help improve the overall international situation and thus contribute to the establishment of lasting peace.

Since the relevant resolutions of the Potsdam Conference have not been implemented to date, German militarism, which caused the two world wars, has not been eradicated, and the danger of its revival has not been completely eliminated. This dictates the need to expedite the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The peace treaty with Germany must guarantee the elimination of the possibility of the revival of German militarism and the resurgence of German aggression.

The conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany will establish a lasting state of peace for the German people, will help Germany develop into a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving country in accordance with the Potsdam Resolutions, and will guarantee the German people the opportunity to cooperate peacefully with other countries.

For these reasons, the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France have decided to begin drafting a peace treaty with Germany immediately.

The governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France believe that the drafting of the treaty must involve Germany, that is, a pan-German government representing Germany, and that the peace treaty with Germany must be based on the following principles:

    苏联政府对德和约的草案
    对德战争结束已经将近七年了，但是，德国仍然没有一个和约，仍然处于分裂状态，处于与其他国家权利不平等的地位。这种不正常的局势必须终止。终止这种局势是完全符合一切爱好和平的人民的愿望的。如果不能早日缔结对德和约，也就不可能保证对德国人民合法的民族利益采取公正的态度。
    缔结对德和约对于巩固欧洲的和平有着极其重大的意义。缔结对德和约之后，就可能最后解决因为第二次世界大战而产生的种种问题。解决这些问题，对于欧洲各个曾经遭受希特勒侵略的国家，特别是德国的邻国，都有着切身的利害关系。缔结对德和约，将有助于改进整个国际形势，并因此而有利于建立持久的和平。
    由于波茨坦会议的有关各项决议迄今没有履行，曾经造成两次世界大战的德国军国主义还没有被根除，它复活的危险仍然没有完全消除。这就决定了必须加速缔结对德和约。对德和约必须保证消除德国军国主义复活和德国侵略再起的可能性。
    缔结对德和约，将为德国人民确立持久的和平状况，将有助于德国按照波茨坦决议发展成为统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的国家，并将保证德国人民有机会和其他国家和平合作。
    根据这些理由，苏联、美国、英国和法国政府决定立即开始草拟对德和约。
    苏联、美国、英国和法国政府认为，草拟和约时，必须有德国参加，亦即由一个代表德国的全德政府参加，同时，对德和约必须以下述的原则为基础：
    对德和约的原则参与国
    大不列颠、苏维埃联盟、美利坚合众国、法兰西、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、比利时、荷兰以及其他曾以其武装部队参加对德作战的国家。
    政治条款
    （一）德国恢复成为统一的国家，从此终止德国的分裂状态。统一的德国应该有机会发展成为独立、民主和爱好和平的国家。
    （二）各占领国的一切武装部队必须在和约生效之后撤离德国，最迟不得超过和约生效后一年。同时，外国在德国领土上的一切军事基地也必须全部取消。
    （三）必须保证德国人民享有民主权利，以便受德国法律管辖的一切人民，不分种族、性别、语言或宗教信仰，一律享有人权和基本自由，包括言论、出版、宗教信仰、政治主张和集会的自由。
    （四）必须保证德国各民主党派和团体的自由活动，给予它们以自由决定其内部事务、举行大会和集会的权利，让它们享有出版和发行的自由。
    （五）一切敌视民主及敌视保卫和平事业的团体，都不能允许在德国境内存在。
    （六）一切前德国军队的服役人员，包括军官和将领，一切前纳粹分子，如非曾因罪行而被法庭判刑者，一律得享有与其他德国人民同等的公民权利和政治权利，以便他们能参与建设爱好和平的、民主的德国。
    （七）德国必须保证不参加任何旨在反对任何一个曾以自己的军队参加对德作战的国家的集团或军事联盟。
    领土
    德国的领土以四大国波茨坦会议诸项决定所规定的疆界为限。
    经济条款
    德国的和平经济应该用来改进德国人民的福利，对这种经济的发展，不得加以任何限制。
    对德国与其他国家的贸易、航运及在世界市场中的地位，亦不得加以任何形式的限制。
    军事条款
    （一）德国可以为了自卫而保有自己本国的武装部队（陆军、海军和空军）。
    （二）德国可以生产军需物资，但生产的数量和种类仅以满足和约所规定的德国武装部队的需要为限，不得超过。
    德国与联合国
    与德国缔结本和约的国家应支持德国要求参加联合国的申请。
