Some Experiences in Pilot Cooperative Establishment in Pastoral Areas
National Cooperative General Society Northwest District Office Qinghai Province Work Group

This April, the Northwest District Cooperative carried out pilot work on establishing a cooperative in the pastoral area of Qianbuquan District, Republican County, Qinghai Province Tibetan Autonomous Region. This establishment was carried out under the principle of "prudence and steady progress." In the short period of 52 days, 334 members were developed (accounting for 11.53% of the total community population and 51% of the total number of households), and 28.8 million yuan of share capital was collected. The supply and marketing cooperative address was set up at Daotang River in this district. Through this pilot cooperative establishment work, the following initial experiences were gained in the business operations of pastoral area cooperatives:

(1) Start with meeting the main needs of the masses. Herdsmen have four major needs: grain (mainly highland barley, followed by flour, with less demand for noodles and rice), tea, cloth (mainly fine cloth, followed by native cloth), and sugar (mainly brown sugar, followed by white sugar, rock candy, and fruit candy). From May 10 to May 19, Daotang River Cooperative sold more than 22.84 million yuan worth of goods in ten days, of which flour and rice accounted for 48.3%, tea accounted for 19.5%, cloth accounted for 15.6% (native cloth accounted for only 0.9%), brown sugar accounted for 7.5%, and general merchandise accounted for 9.1%. Other items such as Rendan (or Da Huo Dan), cigarettes, enamel washbasins, flashlight batteries, sweaters, and shirts are also in high demand; stationery, paper, needles, thread, scissors, matches, seasonings, etc. are in less demand, or even not needed. There are also some commodities that herdsmen have not seen before, such as Soviet floral cloth, aluminum iron spoons and pots, etc., as long as the cooperative operates and promotes them in small quantities, they can still open up sales channels.

(2) Business operations should adapt to local special conditions. Because the needs of the pastoral area masses in terms of commodity types, seasons, and preferences are not well understood, it is necessary to rely on the masses and do a good job of investigation and research to avoid out-of-stock and backlog phenomena in operations. For example, the goods brought by the autonomous region's joint cooperative, such as sheep shears that did not meet specifications, hoes, matches, seasonings, high-quality enamel washbasins, and teacups, were not suitable for the needs of herdsmen. After convening several township heads and herdsmen representatives to discuss the goods brought, they all seriously proposed which items were generally needed by the masses, which were secondary, which were not suitable, and what needed to be added. At the same time, the retail prices calculated by the cooperative were compared with the prices of merchants, and specific adjustment opinions were put forward. This is of great help to the development of cooperative business in pastoral areas.

(3) Understand and grasp the main economic income of herdsmen in a certain period, so that the cooperative's material supply and the herdsmen's purchasing power can be combined. For example, the herdsmen in Daotang River community are currently engaged in the salt transportation sideline, which generates a large income. Herdsmen use this income to mainly purchase daily necessities such as grain, tea, cloth, and sugar. Every time the herdsmen receive the freight from the salt station, they turn around and go to the cooperative to buy goods. For example, on the day the freight was paid on May 9, the cooperative's turnover reached 4.89 million yuan, equivalent to the transaction figure for the 16 days before the salt transportation sideline was started in April. Secondly, supply and purchase operations should be closely coordinated. For example, in the wool purchase season, sufficient materials must be prepared, especially grain (highland barley), tea, cloth, and sugar, so that supply can be carried out simultaneously with purchase. In addition, for the masses' sporadic products such as miscellaneous hides, wool, and butter, help should be provided to find sales channels, because these sporadic hides, etc., seem to be insignificant to the herdsmen, and it is not worthwhile to sell them elsewhere, so the cooperative should try to promote them and conduct transactions according to the herdsmen's habit of exchanging goods, which is very popular with the herdsmen.

(4) Adopt regular delivery or organize members to purchase collectively to adapt to the special circumstances of mobility and dispersion in pastoral areas. At present, the pastoral area is implementing a four-season rotational grazing system. In spring and autumn, grazing is carried out on the mountainside, in summer grazing is carried out on the top of the mountain, and in winter grazing is carried out on the grassland. When grazing on the mountainside or the top of the mountain, it is far from the cooperative, and it is inconvenient for members to purchase. The cooperative can hire yaks to deliver goods. When delivering goods, the opinions of the herdsmen can be solicited, and their requirements can be met as much as possible, and the small needs of individuals can be taken care of. It is also necessary to advocate the method of collectively selecting one member to make unified purchases from the cooperative. In the future, we should discuss with members in many ways and come up with better methods to meet the needs of the special circumstances of dispersion and mobility in pastoral areas.

(5) It is very important to patiently train minority cadres to do business. Because Tibetan cadres generally lack business knowledge, in order to develop cooperative business in pastoral areas, a large number of Tibetan cadres must be trained, and they should be trained in regular business.

Finally, strengthen the ideological education of cadres, so that the salespersons have a loyal and honest attitude in their work, achieve fairness to both the old and the young, and have a high degree of the spirit of serving the people, so as to avoid losses to the herdsmen and damage to the reputation of the cooperative.

    游牧区试办合作社的一些体验
    全国合作总社西北区办事处青海省工作组
    今年四月，西北区合作社在青海省共和县藏族自治区的千卜泉区作了游牧区建社试办工作。这次建社是本着“慎重稳进”的方针进行的，在短短的五十二天的时间中，发展社员三百三十四人（占社区总人口数百分之十一点五三，占总户数百分之五十一），收集股金二千八百八十万元。供销合作社社址设立在该区倒淌河。通过这次建社试办工作，在游牧区合作社经营业务方面，初步获得了以下几点经验：
    （一）要从满足群众主要需要入手。牧民有四大需要——粮食（青稞为主，面粉次之，挂面、大米较少）、茶叶、布匹（细布为主，土布次之）、食糖（红糖为主，白糖、冰糖、水果糖次之）。倒淌河合作社从五月十日至十九日的十天中，销货达二千二百八十四万余元，其中面粉和大米占百分之四十八点三，茶叶占百分之十九点五，布匹占百分之十五点六（土布只占百分之零点九），红糖占百分之七点五，百货占百分之九点一。其他如仁丹（或大?丹），纸烟，搪瓷小面盆、电筒电池、绒衣、衬衣的需要量也较广；文具纸张、针线、剪刀、火柴、调料等需要量较少，甚至不需要。还有些牧民至今没有见过的商品，像苏联花布、铝铁勺壶等，只要合作社少量经营推广，仍是可以打开销路的。
    （二）在业务经营上要适应当地特殊情况。由于对牧区群众在商品种类、季节、嗜好等方面的需要还不够了解，因此要依靠群众，做好调查研究工作，免得在经营中发生脱销与积压现象。像这次在自治区联社所带的货物，如羊毛剪子不合规格，镢头、火柴、调料和质量高的搪瓷面盆及茶缸均不适合牧民需要。经召集了几个乡长和牧民代表对所带货物作了讨论，他们都认真地提出那些是群众普遍需要的，那些是次要的，那些是不适合需要的，还需要增加那些等。同时对该社所核算的零售价格和商贩的价格作了对比，提出了具体的调整意见。这对牧区合作社业务的开展有很大帮助。
    （三）要了解并掌握牧民一定时期的主要经济收入，以便使合作社的物资供应和牧民的购买能力相结合。如倒淌河社区牧民，目前正搞着运盐副业，收入很大。牧民用这些收入，主要购买了生活必需品：如粮食、茶叶、布匹、糖类等。每逢牧民从盐站领到运费后，转身就到合作社买货。如五月九日发付运费那天，合作社的营业额即达四百八十九万元，相当于四月份未开始搞运盐副业前十六天的交易数字。其次，供应与收购业务应密切配合。例如在羊毛收购季节必须准备充分的物资，特别是粮食
    （青稞）、茶、布、糖，以便在收购的同时展开供应。此外，对群众零星产品如杂皮、毛、酥油等，应帮助找销路，因为这些零星皮毛等，在牧民们看来为数甚微，合不着到别处去卖，所以合作社应该设法推销，同时按照牧民换货习惯进行交易，牧民们很欢迎。
    （四）要采用定期送货，或组织社员集体购买的方式，以适应牧区流动与分散的特殊情况。目前牧区是推行四季轮牧制，春秋在山腰放牧，夏季在山顶放牧，冬季在草滩放牧，在山腰或山顶放牧时，离社较远，社员购买不便，合作社可雇用牦牛送货。送货时可以征求牧民意见，尽可能满足他们的要求，并照顾个别人的少量需要。由社员集体推选一人来社统购的方式也是需要提倡的。今后应多方面与社员商量，想出更好的办法，以适应牧区分散与流动的特殊情况的需要。
    （五）要耐心地培养少数民族干部做生意，这一点是很重要的。因为藏民干部大都缺乏买卖知识，为开展牧区合作社业务，必须培养出大批藏民干部，并且应在经常的业务中加以培养。
    最后，加强干部思想教育，使营业员在工作中都具有忠诚老实的态度，做到童叟无欺，抱有高度为人民服务的思想，以免使牧民受到损失和破坏了合作社的信誉。
