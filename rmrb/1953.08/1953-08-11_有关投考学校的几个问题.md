    Several Questions Regarding School Applications
    Q: What procedures are required for on-the-job cadres to apply for universities? Should they complete resignation procedures first?
                                        (Questions from Zhang Li, Zhu Yinhuai, etc.)
    A: On-the-job cadres who wish to study at universities, provided they have a high school diploma or equivalent educational level, are in good health, and can be released from their work, may apply for universities according to the enrollment regulations with the consent and certification from their original work unit leadership. These candidates, except for those who do not apply for foreign language departments and can be exempted from foreign language tests, should take all other subjects' exams and cannot be recommended for admission without examination. When applying, they only need an introductory letter from the leadership agreeing to the application and do not need to go through resignation procedures in advance. If they pass the exam and are admitted, they will then go through resignation procedures; if they fail the exam, they should return to their original work unit to continue working. Their treatment after enrollment is the same as that of general students.
    Q: What are the requirements for general social youth to apply for universities? What procedures should they go through? (Questions from Ren Yuntai, etc.)
    A: According to this year's regulations for university and college enrollment, those who have graduated from high school (or have an equivalent educational level to high school graduates) but have not been admitted to universities, nor have they participated in revolutionary work (or have participated in revolutionary work but have resigned due to certain reasons), if they wish to apply for universities, must be under the age of twenty-seven and must hold an introductory letter from the people's government at or above the district level or a household registration book, and must also submit relevant educational qualification documents. According to regulations, such candidates who have only completed the first year of high school must self-study for more than two years; those who have completed the second year of high school must self-study for more than one year. They can participate in the university entrance examination with the graduation certificate from the original school and self-study certificate. If the formal certificate of relevant academic qualifications mentioned above has not been obtained or has been lost after being obtained, it can be certified in writing by the principal, teacher, or classmate of the original school (who should be an on-the-job cadre currently serving in a revolutionary organ, and their identity should be certified by the official seal of the organ); transcripts of each semester, yearbooks, school publications, and other relevant certification documents can also be submitted to the local enrollment agency for review; after review and approval, they can also participate in the unified enrollment examination of universities. To ensure the quality of national cadre training, social youth who have not graduated from junior high school or have graduated from junior high school, as well as those who have not completed more than one year of high school, should find ways to apply for secondary specialized schools or ordinary middle schools that are compatible with their academic foundation and study step by step. As for the specific examination methods and procedures, you can contact the local enrollment agency for details.
                (Answered by the National University and College Enrollment Committee)
    Q: Why is there an age limit for middle school enrollment? (Questions from Jiang Dehua, etc.)
    A: In our country's new school system, ordinary middle schools are mainly set up for children and adolescents, and the teaching plan is also formulated according to the physical and mental development of children and adolescents, so there must be a certain limit in terms of age. However, in order to take care of older people who have dropped out of school, the Central Ministry of Education has stipulated that all localities can, according to the central government's stipulated enrollment age standards, combine the specific conditions of the region, and make appropriate adjustments on the principle that there will be no difficulties in teaching, but the difference should not be too large. As for older students, they can apply for spare-time schools and various technical training classes. If they cannot be promoted to a higher school or fail the exam, they should participate in production and work.

    有关投考学校的几个问题
    问：在职干部报考高等学校需具备那些手续？是否应先办离职手续？
                                        （张立、朱印槐等问）
    答：志愿进入高等学校学习的在职干部，只要具有高中毕业或相当于高中毕业的文化程度，身体健康，工作能够离得开，经原工作单位领导方面同意并开具证明文件，即可按招生规定报考高等学校。这类考生，除了不是志愿报考外国语系科的学生可以免试外国语文外，其它各科都应参加考试，不能免试保送入学。他们在报考时只需领导开具同意报考的介绍信，不必先行办理离职手续。如经考试合格录取，再办理离职手续；如考试不合格，仍应回原机关继续工作。他们入学后的待遇与一般学生相同。
    问：一般社会青年报考高等学校需要什么条件？应该经过什么手续？（任运太等问）
    答：按今年高等学校招考新生的规定，曾在高中毕业（或现有相当于高中毕业的文化程度）而未考入高等学校、亦未参加革命工作（或曾参加革命工作而因事离职）者，如欲报考高等学校，除年龄须在二十七岁以下和须持有所在地区的区或区以上人民政府介绍函件或户籍簿以外，并须缴验有关学历证明文件。按规定，此类考生如只修满高中一年，必须自修二年以上；修满高中二年，必须自修一年以上。他们持有原肄业学校肄业证明及自修证明文件，即可参加高等学校入学考试。如上列有关学历的正式证明文件未曾领得或曾领得而现已遗失，可由原肄业学校的校长、教师或同学（应为现服务于革命机关的在职干部，并由所在机关加盖公章证明其身份）书面证明；还可以将各学期成绩单、同学录、年刊、校刊及其他有关证明文件作为参考证件送当地招生机构审查；经审查批准后，亦可参加高等学校的统一招生考试。为保证国家培养干部的质量，初中未毕业或初中毕业以及高中未修满一年以上的社会青年，应设法报考与自己学业基础相适应的中等专业学校或普通中学，按步就班地进行学习。至于具体考试办法及手续，可和当地招生机构联系了解。
                （以上全国高等学校招生委员会答）
    问：中学招生为何要限制年龄？（蒋德华等问）
    答：在我国的新学制中，普通中学主要是为儿童及青、少年而设的，教学计划也是根据儿童及青、少年的身心发展而订定的，所以在年龄方面不能不有一定限制。但为了照顾年长失学的人，中央教育部曾规定：各地可根据中央规定的入学年龄标准，结合本地区具体情况，在教学上不会发生困难的原则下酌予伸缩，但也不能相差太大。至于年龄较大的同学，则可以投考业余学校及各种技术训练班，如不能升学或考不取，则应该参加生产和工作。
                                （中央人民政府教育部答）
