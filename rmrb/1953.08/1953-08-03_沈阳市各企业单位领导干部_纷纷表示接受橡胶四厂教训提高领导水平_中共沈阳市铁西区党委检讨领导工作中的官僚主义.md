Leading Cadres of Various Enterprises and Units in Shenyang Expressed Acceptance of Lessons from the No. 4 Rubber Factory to Improve Leadership Level
The CPC Tiexi District Committee of Shenyang City Conducted a Self-Criticism of Bureaucratism in Leadership Work

After the exposure of the incident of Zhao Jun, the former director of the state-owned Northeast No. 4 Rubber Factory, and others, who had long falsely reported achievements and defrauded the title of advanced factory, leading cadres of various enterprises and units in Shenyang City attached great importance to it. The CPC Tiexi District Committee of Shenyang City and the Shenyang City Light Industry Trade Union, which directly led the No. 4 Rubber Factory, have both conducted self-criticisms.

The self-criticism of the CPC Tiexi District Committee of Shenyang City stated: The reason why Zhao Jun and others' serious violations of law and discipline could exist for a long time without being discovered is inseparable from the bureaucratic leadership of the CPC Tiexi District Committee of Shenyang City. The district committee blindly trusted the factory's so-called reports of "steady increase in quality" and "overfulfillment of tasks" and never systematically and seriously inspected the factory's work, but only went to the factory to find experience and methods. Even when they heard the masses reflect on the problems in the factory's production, they thought that "shortcomings are inevitable in the work" and did not conduct inspections. From the problem of the No. 4 Rubber Factory, it can also be seen that the district committee is also extremely weak in political and ideological leadership and has failed to regularly and effectively educate enterprise cadres, so they lacked a high sense of responsibility for the cause of the Party and the state. The self-criticism of the Shenyang City Light Industry Trade Union stated: "This incident exposed our bureaucratic and formalistic work style and lack of in-depth investigation and meticulous inspection. Secondly, the leadership of grassroots trade unions is generalized. Grassroots trade unions must grasp the overall situation of production in actual work and rely on workers to grasp the output and quality of each period, etc., but the grassroots trade union of the No. 4 Rubber Factory is not like this, which is inseparable from the generalized leadership of the Shenyang City Light Industry Trade Union."

Many leading cadres of state-owned enterprises in Shenyang City also wrote letters to the Northeast Daily, criticizing Zhao Jun's bad behavior and examining their own work. Men Runsen, Secretary of the General Branch Committee of the CPC Shenyang Woolen Mill, believes that as a leader of a grassroots party organization, the lessons learned from the Zhao Jun incident are profound. He said that some cadres in the factory used to have the idea of liking praise and disliking criticism to varying degrees, and the Party committee also mistakenly believed that criticism would affect work and that praise was better. This kind of accommodating thought is actually condoning evil and relaxing the leadership of the Party. For example, the tasks assigned by the higher authorities were based on one product,毛毯(Mao Tan) a standard, but the factory is a factory with a variety of products, so calculating the monthly task requires converting other products into 毛毯(Mao Tan) calculations. When the product changes in the middle of the month, the task figures must be adjusted appropriately, but the cadres who do the calculations often only consider whether this is suitable for the factory to complete the task. If it is not suitable, they will not change it. This fully shows that there is an idea of finding cheap and taking shortcuts. The Party organization is indifferent to this matter of principle. Men Runsen finally proposed that we must draw lessons from the Zhao Jun incident, improve political level, and learn production business knowledge. Han Zhihua, director of the Northeast No. 7 Rubber Factory, also reviewed similar incidents in his letter. For example, in the 1951 increase production and practice economy movement, in order to pursue savings figures, the factory completely removed the raw rubber from the small soles of rubber shoes, reducing the quality of the rubber shoes, causing significant political and economic losses to state-owned enterprises. Fortunately, the higher authorities checked and helped in time to correct it. In order to learn from the Zhao Jun error incident, the factory is prepared to collect relevant factual materials to conduct in-depth education to improve everyone's political and ideological level and establish an honest work style. Gao Yuchen, deputy director of the Northeast No. 6 Paper Mill, also proposed that the following must be done in future work: 1. Seriously study the instructions of the higher authorities; 2. Carry out criticism and self-criticism.

Many letters also analyzed and criticized the root causes of Zhao Jun and others' mistakes. Gao Fangqi, director of the National Model Factory 53 Factory, pointed out that this series of serious errors was because they did not humbly learn and improve themselves politically, which led to such bad consequences.

    沈阳市各企业单位领导干部
    纷纷表示接受橡胶四厂教训提高领导水平
    中共沈阳市铁西区党委检讨领导工作中的官僚主义
    国营东北橡胶四厂前任厂长赵均等，长期假报成绩骗取先进厂称号的事件被揭发后，沈阳市各企业单位领导干部都极为重视。直接领导橡胶四厂的中共沈阳市铁西区委员会和沈阳市轻工业工会都作了检讨。
    中共沈阳市铁西区委员会的检讨中说：赵均等这种严重的违法乱纪行为，所以能够长期存在未被发现，是和中共沈阳市铁西区委员会的官僚主义的领导分不开的。区委盲目信任该厂所谓“质量稳步上升”、“超额完成任务”的报告，从未系统地认真检查过该厂的工作，而只是到该厂去找经验、找方法，甚至听到群众反映该厂生产中的问题时，还认为“工作中缺点是不可避免的”，而不去进行检查。从橡胶四厂这一问题，也可看出区委在政治思想领导上也极为薄弱，未能经常有效地对企业干部进行教育，使他们对党和国家的事业产生高度的责任感。沈阳市轻工业工会的检讨说：“这一事件暴露了我们工作中的官僚主义、形式主义的工作作风，缺乏深入调查研究和细致的检查。其次是对基层工会的领导一般化。基层工会在实际工作中必须掌握生产全面情况，依靠职工掌握每个时期的产量、质量等，但橡胶四厂的基层工会并不是这样，这是和沈阳市轻工业工会领导的一般化分不开的。”
    沈阳市很多国营企业的领导干部也都写信给东北日报，批判赵均等的恶劣行为，并检查自己的工作。中共沈阳毛织厂总支委员会书记门润深认为：作为一个党的基层组织的领导人员，从赵均事件中所得到的教训是深刻的。他说该厂个别干部，曾经程度不同地存在着喜欢表扬、不愿批评的思想，党委也错误地认为批评会影响工作，不如表扬好。这种迁就思想，实际上就是姑息养奸，放松了党的领导。又如上级给的任务是按毛毯一种产品为标准的，而该厂是一个多种产品的工厂，因此每月计算任务需要把其他产品折合成毛毯计算，遇到月中变更产品时，必须将任务数字适当调整，但作计算的工作干部，往往只考虑这对本厂完成任务是否合适，不合适就不改了，这充分说明有找便宜、取巧的思想。对这个原则问题，党的组织却漠不关心。门润深最后提出：必须从赵均事件中吸取经验教训，提高政治水平、学习生产业务知识。东北第七橡胶厂厂长韩致华，也在信中检讨了类似橡胶四厂的事情。如一九五一年增产节约运动中，为了追求节约数字，该厂竟把胶鞋小底中的生胶完全去掉，降低了胶鞋的质量，造成了国营企业在政治上、经济上的重大损失，幸亏上级及时检查、帮助才得纠正。为了从赵均错误事件中吸取教训，该厂准备收集有关类似事实材料，进行深入的教育，用以提高每个人的政治、思想水平，树立老老实实工作作风。东北第六造纸厂副厂长高御臣也提出了今后工作中必须作到：一、认真学习上级指示；二、开展批评与自我批评。
    很多来信中，还分析批判了赵均等产生错误的根源。全国模范工厂五三工厂厂长高方启，指出这一系列的严重错误，就是因为他们没有虚心学习，从政治上提高自己，以致造成这样的恶果。
