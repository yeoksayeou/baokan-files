Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 2nd: The construction of the reception station and temporary guest house prepared by the Korean-Chinese side for receiving our captured personnel is nearing completion.

	The reception station is located at Gajyoryeong, one kilometer southwest of Panmunjom. The entire reception area is 200 meters long and 15 meters wide. It will house a command post and ten large tents. Each large tent can accommodate 30 people. A small tent will also be erected next to each large tent, exclusively for the use of staff to rest. A corridor will be built in front of the tents to facilitate the reception of our captured personnel during rainy weather. Two new roads, each 250 meters long, will be built at the front and rear of the reception area. One is exclusively for vehicles from the other side transporting our captured personnel, and the other is exclusively for our vehicles transporting captured personnel to various guest houses. Construction of the reception area began on July 30 and is expected to be completed before August 4.

	In recent days, the staff constructing the guest houses have been working tirelessly in the scorching heat to erect tent frames and arrange the guest houses. They have successively built a hygiene passage zone, eight guest houses, and erected seven large mat sheds. To facilitate the smooth passage of vehicles, the staff actively participated in widening roads and filling in depressions. Each guest house is equipped with a kitchen and dining hall. These past two days, some of the guest house staff have been installing bed boards, bedding, and blankets, while others are arranging small flower gardens for the recreational enjoyment of the captured personnel, and still others are building a stage for the entertainment of the captured personnel.

	When repatriation begins, sick and wounded captured personnel will be repatriated with priority. The Korean-Chinese side has prepared two well-equipped hospitals for our returning sick and wounded captured personnel. The staff of the two medical teams have been actively building wards, tidying up the interior, and arranging the environment in recent days. The hospitals are divided into internal medicine wards, surgical wards, infectious disease wards, and tuberculosis wards, according to the type of illness. Both hospitals have clean patient rooms, treatment rooms, operating rooms, bandage rooms, and pharmacies with ample medicine reserves, as well as spacious dining halls and bathrooms. All staff members are currently laying clean mattresses and new blankets on each bed, sending flower pots to each patient room, and some patient rooms even have exquisitely beautiful small flower gardens built around them.
