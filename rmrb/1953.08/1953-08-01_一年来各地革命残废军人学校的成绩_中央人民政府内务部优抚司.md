    After the Government Administration Council's "Decision on Strengthening Formal Education in Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Schools" was announced in July 1952, it was warmly supported by revolutionary disabled soldiers. People's governments at all levels adopted a series of measures to implement it. Major administrative regions formulated implementation methods for education in revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools. Some major administrative regions and provinces convened meetings to study and formulate implementation plans, reorganized institutions, changed the organizational form of revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools from militarized to school-based, improved equipment, allocated and strengthened cadres and teachers, and conducted work such as establishing schools and classifying students according to their physical conditions and cultural levels. By August and September 1952, revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools officially opened one after another.

    Over the past year, due to the above-mentioned work carried out in various regions, coupled with the efforts of all faculty, staff, and students in revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools, there have been significant achievements in teaching. Revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools across various regions have universally eliminated illiteracy through the Qi Jianhua rapid literacy method and the Sun Keding rapid arithmetic method. The cultural level of some revolutionary disabled soldiers has rapidly improved to the level of primary school graduation, while others have improved to the level of junior high school first or second grade, or junior high school graduation. In the revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools in Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, Shaanxi, Liaodong, Songjiang, and other eight provinces, the original 70 percent of students were illiterate. Now, 57 percent of students have reached the junior high school level, and the rest have reached the primary school level. Students in revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools, due to many favorable conditions such as higher political awareness, a larger number of Party and Youth League members, and a younger age (the vast majority being under 30), can study diligently and have demonstrated many exemplary deeds in their studies. Students in revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools in Anhui and other provinces diligently study their lessons at all times, taking notes automatically and making rapid progress. Student Ding Huaqing broke more than a dozen pen nibs in two months, finally using his left hand to write neatly. Many students in the Shandong Second Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Rapid Middle School expressed their determination to guarantee the completion of their studies with the fighting spirit of attacking bunkers. According to statistics, 98 percent of the students in one class were able to concentrate on their studies. The relationship between teachers and students is also very harmonious. The teacher-student relationship in the Hubei Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' School has become a model for all schools in Wuhan. Faculty and staff no longer feel that working in revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools offers no future, but generally feel honored and that the task is important, fearing that they may not be able to handle it. The more serious ideas of self-importance and individualism that once existed among students have also been gradually overcome in the rising tide of learning. After completing a period of study, many revolutionary disabled soldiers have embarked on the path of national construction and are playing an active role in their work. In the past year, nearly a thousand students from revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools in East China and Shandong have participated in work or study in industrial, construction, judicial, and civil affairs departments, and have generally received praise from the relevant authorities. Yang Jinshan, who participated in the work of the Planning Department of the Shandong Provincial People's Government Industry Department, has been promoted to deputy section chief due to his active study of technology. Basic construction departments in East China generally reflect that wherever there are students from revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools, there are fewer difficulties, and construction is faster, more economical, and better.

    In order to materially ensure the regularization of revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools and provide students with a comfortable learning and living environment, over the past year, the central and local governments at all levels have successively allocated more than 260 billion yuan to build classrooms and dormitories for some schools, and have focused on building libraries, laboratories, dining halls, bathrooms, sanatoriums, etc. The recreational, sports, teaching equipment, books, and instruments of revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools have also been replenished. The Northwest Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' School now has more than 1,500 books, more than 200 kinds of specimen instruments, and 13 categories and 55 kinds of recreational and sports equipment. Sports activities in revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools across various regions are very active. In the last semester, 80 to 90 percent of the students in the Liaodong Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' School regularly participated in sports activities and established extracurricular activity groups such as track and field, gymnastics, and ball games. Students from revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools in some areas also held friendly ball games with outsiders. Medical work has also improved over the past year. Due to the attention of school leaders and the efforts of medical staff, regular disease prevention and outpatient work within revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools have been significantly strengthened. These measures have improved the physical and mental health of students and effectively guaranteed the progress of their studies.

    Although revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools have achieved great success in the past year, there are still many problems to be solved. The measures adopted by various regions in implementing the Government Administration Council's decision are extremely inconsistent. In terms of teaching principles and requirements, some excessively emphasize entering universities, requiring 60 percent of students to pursue advanced studies; the teaching plan has many subjects and progresses simultaneously; the length of schooling is sometimes too short, eager for quick results, such as requiring illiterate students to reach the high school level in Chinese in two years. In addition, because the civil affairs departments at all levels have done a poor job in actively contacting and striving for the assistance of relevant departments, the relevant departments do not fully understand the spirit of the Government Administration Council's decision. Some believe that running revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools well is a matter for the civil affairs department, and they have relaxed their guidance on the work of revolutionary disabled soldiers' schools, resulting in problems such as a lack of teachers, inconsistent teaching materials, simple medical equipment, and the failure to solve the employment, further education, and transfer of students after graduating from junior high school in a timely manner. These problems need to be further and seriously studied in order to improve.

    一年来各地革命残废军人学校的成绩
    中央人民政府内务部优抚司
    一九五二年七月政务院“关于加强革命残废军人学校正规教育的决定”公布后，受到革命残废军人的热烈拥护。各级人民政府采取了一系列的措施予以贯彻。各大行政区均制订了革命残废军人学校教育实施办法，有些大行政区和省召开了会议，研究拟订了执行方案，整编了机构，改变了革命残废军人学校的组织形式，从军队化转为学校化，改善了设备，调配与加强了干部和师资，并按革命残废军人的身体条件和文化程度分别进行了建校与编级编班等工作。至一九五二年八、九月份，各革命残废军人学校先后正式开学。
    一年来，由于各地进行了上述一系列的工作，加上革命残废军人学校全体教职员和学员的努力，教学成绩很大。各地革命残废军人学校通过祁建华速成识字法和孙克定速成算术法，普遍扫除了文盲，一部分革命残废军人的文化水平已迅速提高到小学毕业的程度，另一部分已提高到初中一、二年级或初中毕业的程度。山东、河北、河南、安徽、湖北、陕西、辽东、松江等八省的革命残废军人学校中，原来百分之七十的学员都是文盲，现在百分之五十七的学员已达到初中程度，其余为小学程度。革命残废军人学校中的学员，由于具备许多优越条件，例如政治觉悟较高，党、团员较多，年纪轻、三十岁以下的占绝大多数，因而都能认真学习，并在学习上涌现出许多模范事迹。安徽等省革命残废军人学校的学员，在学习中时刻钻研功课，自动写读书笔记，进步很快。学员丁华清在两个月中写坏十多个钢笔尖，终于用左手把字写得端正了。山东第二革命残废军人速成中学不少学员表示决心，要以攻碉堡的战斗精神来保证完成学习任务，其中有一个班据统计有百分之九十八的学员都能安心学习。师生关系也很融洽，湖北革命残废军人学校的师生关系已成为武汉市各校的模范。教职员也不再认为在革命残废军人学校中工作没有前途，而普遍感到光荣，任务重大，惟恐不能胜任。过去在学员中曾经存在着较严重的居功自傲思想和闹个人主义问题的，也都在高涨的学习热潮中逐渐克服。许多革命残废军人在学习告一段落后，踏上了祖国建设的岗位，并在工作中发挥了积极作用。华东、山东革命残废军人学校一年来已有近千名学员到工业、建筑、司法、民政等部门参加工作或学习，一般都获得主管部门的好评。参加山东省人民政府工业厅计划处工作的杨金山，由于积极钻研技术，已被提升为副科长。华东各地基本建设部门普遍反映：那里有革命残废军人学校出来的学员，那里的困难就少，建筑又快、又省、又好。
    为了从物质上保证革命残废军人学校的正规化，使学员得到安适的学习和生活环境，一年来，中央和各级地方人民政府先后拨出二千六百多亿元，修建了部分学校的教室和宿舍，并有重点地建筑了图书室、试验室、餐厅、浴室、疗养室等。革命残废军人学校的文娱、体育、教学设备及图书仪器也得到补充。西北革命残废军人学校已有图书一千五百余册，标本仪器二百余种，文娱、体育设备十三类五十五种。各地革命残废军人学校的体育活动都很活跃。辽东省革命残废军人学校上学期有百分之八十到九十的学员经常参加体育活动，成立了田径赛、器械操、球类等课外活动小组。有些地区的革命残废军人学校学员，还和外界举行球类友谊比赛。医疗工作一年来也有改善。由于学校领导干部的重视，医务工作人员的努力，革命残废军人学校内部的经常的疾病预防和门诊工作已显著加强。这些措施增进了学员的身心健康，有效地保证了学员学业的进展。
    一年来，革命残废军人学校虽然获得很大成绩，但仍存在着许多尚待解决的问题。各地在执行政务院决定时，采取的措施极不一致。在教学方针与要求上，有的过分强调升入大学为主，要求百分之六十的学员深造；教学计划科目繁多，齐头并进；修业年限，有的规定过短，急于求成，如有的要求文盲的学员在二年内语文达到高中程度。另外由于各级民政部门主动联系与争取有关部门的协助作得很差，各有关部门对政务院决定的精神体会不够，有的认为办好革命残废军人学校是民政部门的事，放松了对革命残废军人学校工作的指导，致使革命残废军人学校中存在着师资缺乏、教材不统一、医疗设备简陋以及学员在初中毕业后的就业、升学、转学等问题未能及时得到解决。这些问题，均须作进
    一步的认真的研究，以求得改进。
