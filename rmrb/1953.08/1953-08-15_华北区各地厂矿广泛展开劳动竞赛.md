Labor Competitions Widely Unfolded in Factories and Mines in North China

Since April of this year, the broad masses of workers in factories and mines in various parts of North China have widely launched labor competitions based on discussions of the national plan. According to preliminary statistics, 552 factories and mines in the region have participated in the competition, of which 80 percent are in Tianjin and more than 62 percent are in Hebei Province. The North China Electric Power System launched a competition between bureaus and factories, including six bureaus and seventeen factories, starting on May 1st. Most of the factories and mines participating in the competition have completed or exceeded the state's plans. In May and June, the number of power generation accidents in the entire North China Electric Power System decreased by 46.4 percent compared with the same period last year; under the condition of ensuring safety, the power generation completed 105.7 percent; and the plant power consumption rate decreased by 0.21 percent. The completion of plans in Beijing and Tianjin factories is also rising month by month. The Shijingshan Power Plant completed all planned targets in both April and May, which is the first time in the history of the plant. The units with better competition development have the following characteristics: First, combining the promotion of the Five-Three Factory experience with the development of labor competition, the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League work in coordination. For example, the Tianjin Clothing Factory studied the experience of the Five-Three Factory at the beginning of this year and solved the leadership problem of the competition. When formulating the competition plan, the administration first proposed the current key issues and specific requirements for the competition based on the production and management situation. The trade union formulated specific methods for mobilizing the masses to carry out the competition based on the requirements of the administration, which were discussed and approved by the Party general branch committee and implemented separately by the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League as Party resolutions. In this way, the role of each organization was fully exerted under unified leadership. Second, importance was attached to political and ideological leadership. Education was carried out for cadres and workers to explain the purpose and significance of the competition, paying attention to correcting the tendency of championshipism, and changing the past practice of leaders subjectively formulating competition conditions and "rushing into action." Third, the goals are clear. Generally, comprehensively and balancedly completing the national plan and solving the key problems of the unit are taken as the main conditions for the competition. At the same time, the organization of the competition is also relatively detailed. Attention has been paid to promoting advanced experience, mobilizing technical personnel, formulating group pacts, contact contracts, collective contracts, and holding production meetings. Some units can also check regularly or in a timely manner, and create mass-based evaluation methods. For example, the state-owned Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory grasped the key issues of reducing yarn breakage and defective yarn in the yarn workshop, and reducing second-class cloth in the cloth workshop. The goals of the competition were clear and specific. At the same time, it mobilized technical personnel to participate in the competition and realized the technical measures plan. Therefore, the planned targets for output and quality were completed in both May and June.

However, at present, many grassroots trade union organizations in factories and mines have not thoroughly understood that continuing to deepen the sound and regular labor competition is the central task of trade union work. Formalistic tendencies are still widespread. In some factories and mines in Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, and Xuanhua, in order to welcome "May Day" and the opening of the Seventh National Congress of the Trade Union, the leadership rushed into competition without even studying the competition conditions, which quickly subsided. In some places, the competition has already started, but due to the leadership being limited to general appeals, the results are not great.

### 华北区各地厂矿广泛展开劳动竞赛

    华北区各地厂矿广泛展开劳动竞赛
    华北区各地厂矿广大职工，从今年四月起，在讨论国家计划的基础上，广泛地展开了劳动竞赛，现在，初步统计，全区参加竞赛的厂矿已经有五百五十二个，其中天津市占其所属工厂的百分之八十；河北省占其所属工厂的百分之六十二以上。华北区电业系统从“五一”开始，展开了包括六局、十七个厂的局、厂之间的竞赛。参加竞赛的厂矿大部分都完成或超额完成了国家的计划。五、六两月，整个华北电业系统的发电事故比去年同期减少了百分之四十六点四；在保证安全的条件下，发电量完成了百分之一百零五点七；厂用电率降低了百分之零点二一。北京、天津各厂完成计划的情况也是逐月上升的。石景山发电厂四、五两月连续全面完成各项计划指标，这是该厂有史以来的第一次。竞赛开展较好的单位，有下面几个特点：第一、把推广五三工厂经验和开展劳动竞赛结合起来，党、行政、工会、青年团协同一致地工作。如天津被服厂今年初学习了五三工厂的经验，解决了竞赛的领导问题。在制订竞赛计划时，首先由行政根据生产和管理方面的情况，提出目前关键问题和对竞赛的具体要求，工会根据行政的要求拟出发动群众开展竞赛的具体办法，在党总支委员会上讨论通过，并作为党的决议，由党、行政、工会、青年团分别贯彻执行。这样在统一领导下充分发挥了各组织的作用。第二、重视了政治思想领导。对干部和职工进行了教育，说明竞赛的目的和意义，注意纠正锦标主义倾向，改变了过去领导上主观拟定竞赛条件，“一哄而起”的作法。第三、目标明确。一般都以全面均衡完成国家计划和解决本单位的关键问题作为竞赛的主要条件。同时，竞赛的组织工作也比较细致。注意了推广先进经验，发动技术人员，订立小组公约、联系合同、集体合同，和举行生产会议等。有的单位并能够定期或及时检查，创造了群众性的评比办法。如国营天津第六棉纺织厂在纱场抓住了减少断头、坏纱；布场抓住了减少次布等关键问题，竞赛的目标明确具体。同时又动员技术人员参加竞赛，实现了技术措施计划，所以，五、六两月都完成了产量和质量的计划指标。
    但是，目前有不少厂矿基层工会组织还没有透彻了解，继续深入地展开健全的经常性的劳动竞赛，是工会工作的中心任务。形式主义的偏向还普遍存在。张家口、石家庄、宣化等地有些厂矿为迎接“五一”和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的开幕，领导上连竞赛条件也没有研究，就把竞赛哄了起来，结果很快就消沉了下去。有些地方竞赛已经开展起来，但由于领导上仅限于一般号召，成绩不大。
