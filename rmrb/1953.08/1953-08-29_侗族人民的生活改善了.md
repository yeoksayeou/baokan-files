    The Liping County of Guizhou Province, close to the border of Hunan and Guangxi provinces, is a plateau with an elevation of over two thousand meters. In the midst of towering mountains, grow dense forests of fir and pine. 150,000 simple and brave Dong people live in these deep mountain valleys.

    Before liberation, the Dong people, like other brotherly ethnic groups, were subjected to the cruel oppression of reactionary rulers for a long time, living an extremely miserable life. Especially under the bloody rule of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, they suffered severely from being conscripted into the army, being forced to pay levies, and from the burning, killing, and looting. Some families were broken up and their members killed or scattered; some fled to high mountains, valleys, and earthen kilns to live a tragic life. Many people could not eat even an ounce of salt for months, and could not wear a set of clothes for years.

    After liberation, the sun of Mao Zedong illuminated the plateau. The glory of the ethnic policy brought boundless happiness and warmth to the Dong people. The Dong people who had wandered into the deep mountains and valleys came out of the mountains one after another, working diligently and happily on the vast plateau to build their own happy life.

    Thanks to the meticulous care and concern of the People's Government for the Dong people, great changes have taken place in their production and life. Their political awareness has been unprecedentedly enhanced. The Party and the People's Government have cultivated many ethnic minority cadres for the Dong people. In addition to village cadres, there are also excellent Dong county and district cadres such as Feng Xingmo, Deputy County Chief of Liping County, Long An, District Chief of the Sixth District, and Wu Guoxiang, District Chief of the Fourth District.

    Under the leadership of the People's Government, the Dong people not only received land, houses, and livestock, but also changed their backward mode of production. This year, in order to support the production of ethnic minorities, the People's Government issued various agricultural loans totaling 1,009,377,000 yuan from January to the end of April, of which agricultural production loans accounted for more than 70% of the total loan amount. Dong farmers purchased 1,366 head of cattle, added 15,981 pieces of various farm implements, and also built many small-scale water conservancy projects and added cattle pens. In addition, the People's Government also distributed 37,392 catties of rice and some paddy rice to help the poverty-stricken Dong people solve the difficulty of lacking cooking utensils such as spatulas and tripods. The Provincial People's Government also allocated 65,650,000 yuan of free agricultural tool funds in April to process and manufacture various agricultural tools in the county. In Diping Township alone, 700 plows, 200 harrows, 200 hoes, and 200 sickles were distributed free of charge; in Huamin Township, 420 plows, 380 harrows, 360 hoes, and 400 sickles were distributed free of charge. These measures greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the Dong people. They said one after another: Chairman Mao cares about us Dong people so much, we would be really sorry for him if we don't increase production! Everyone expressed that they would produce well to repay Chairman Mao. Dong farmer Wu Guohao increased the fertilizer application from 400 catties per dan of field to 640 catties, and also wanted to burn 100 catties of ash. He also increased the plowing and harrowing from three times each to four times each.

    With the improvement of production, the life of the Dong people has also been further improved. Purchasing power has generally increased. This year, the People's Government also appropriately supported 182 small industrial and commercial households, including 17 blacksmith shops manufacturing agricultural tools, guaranteeing the supply of agricultural tools in the market. The four blacksmiths in the Second District made more than 400 agricultural tools in February. In June of this year, a material exchange meeting was held in Cheng Guan District. Many Dong people braved the rain to come from afar to purchase what they needed. Wu Yongmao, a Dong farmer from the First District, bought daily necessities such as undershirts, towels, candies, shoes, socks, salt, and meat worth more than 150,000 yuan.

    Under the leadership of the People's Government, the cultural, educational, and health undertakings of the Dong people have also developed greatly. Now the number of primary schools in the county has increased to 117, and the number of classes has expanded to 340; the number of enrolled children has reached 11,755, which is double that at the beginning of liberation. In November last year, the Provincial People's Government allocated more than 50 million yuan to build a national primary school in Zaitou Village, Fourth District. At present, 227 Dong children are living and studying happily here. Last winter, the People's Government promptly made and distributed cotton clothes and distributed them to Dong children free of charge. Each student also receives 10,000 yuan for books and stationery each semester. In addition, 50 children enjoy different levels of people's scholarships. Dong children Wu Shunyun and Wu Guanfu used to be orphans wandering on the streets begging for food, but now they are also studying here.

    In terms of medical and health care, a national health center has recently been added in the Seventh District; a maternal and child care station has been established in the Ninth District; and there is also a mobile medical team. The people's doctors often cross mountains and ridges to go to consultations dozens of miles away and give vaccinations to the Dong people.

    侗族人民的生活改善了
    廖涛声  宗玲
    靠近湖南、广西两省边界的贵州省黎平县，是拔海二千来公尺的高原。在重山峻岭之间，生长着茂密的杉木松林。十五万朴实、勇敢的侗族人民就住在这高山深谷中。
    解放前，侗族人民和其他兄弟民族一样，长期地受着历代反动统治者的残酷压榨，过着极其悲惨的日子。尤其是在国民党匪帮的血腥统治下，更饱受拉兵、派款、烧杀抢劫的严重迫害。有的家破人亡、流离失所；有的逃到高山、峡谷、土窑中去过着悲惨的生活。很多人几个月吃不上一两盐巴，几年穿不上一套衣裤。
    解放后，毛泽东的太阳照亮了高原。民族政策的光辉给侗族人民带来了无限的幸福和温暖。流浪到深山峡谷中的侗族人民纷纷出山，辛勤愉快地在广阔的高原上，建设自己幸福的生活。
    由于人民政府对侗族人民无微不至的照顾和关怀，侗族人民在生产和生活上已起了巨大的变化。他们的政治觉悟已经空前地提高了。党和人民政府为侗族人民培养了不少的民族干部。除乡村干部外，还有黎平县副县长冯兴谟、六区区长龙安、四区区长吴国祥等优秀的侗族县区干部。
    在人民政府的领导下，侗族人民不仅分得了田地、房屋和耕畜，而且还改变了落后的生产方式。今年，人民政府为了扶持少数民族生产，从一月至四月底，就发放了各种农业贷款十亿零九千三百七十七万元，其中农业生产贷款占总贷款额的百分之七十以上。侗族农民购买耕牛一千三百六十六头，增添各种农具一万五千九百八十一件；还兴修了很多小型水利和增设了牛圈。此外人民政府还发放了大米三万七千三百九十二斤及部分稻谷，帮助赤贫侗族人民解决缺乏锅铲、鼎罐等生活用品的困难。省人民政府又在四月间拨发了无偿农具款六千五百六十五万元，在县内加工制造各种农具。仅在地坪乡即无偿发放了犁七百架、耙二百把、锄头二百把、镰刀二百把；在化民乡无偿发放了犁四百二十架、耙三百八十架、锄头三百六十把、镰刀四百把。这些措施大大鼓舞了侗族人民的生产积极性。他们纷纷说：毛主席这样关心我们侗族，如再不增产真对不起他老人家！大家都表示要好好生产，来报答毛主席。侗族农民吴国豪由原打算每担田施肥四百斤，增加到六百四十斤，并要烧灰一百斤，原打算三犁三耙也增加到四犁四耙。
    随着生产的改进，侗族人民生活也获得更进一步的改善。购买力普遍提高。人民政府在今年还适当地扶持了一百八十二户小工商业户，其中有十七户是制造农具的打铁炉，保证了市场农具的供应。二区的四户铁匠，二月份便打了四百多件农具。今年六月，在城关区举行了一次物资交流会。很多侗族人民都由远道冒雨赶来，购置自己所需要的东西。一区侗族农民吴永茂买了价值十五万多元的汗衫、毛巾、糖果、鞋袜、盐巴和肉等日用品。
    在人民政府的领导下，侗族人民的文教卫生事业也有很大的发展。现在全县的小学已增加到一百一十七所，班级扩充到三百四十个；入学儿童已达一万一千七百五十五人，较初解放时增加了一倍。去年十一月，省人民政府又拨发了五千多万元，在四区寨头村修建了一所民族小学。目前，已有二百二十七个侗族儿童在这里幸福地生活和学习了。去年冬天，人民政府及时地制发了棉衣，无偿地分配给侗族儿童。每个学生每学期还领到一万元的书籍文具费。此外，还有五十个儿童享受了不同等级的人民助学金。侗族儿童吴顺云、吴关福两人，以前都是流落在街头乞食的孤儿，现在也在这里读书了。
    在医疗卫生方面，最近在七区增设了一个民族卫生所；九区创设一个妇幼保育站；还有一个巡回医疗队。人民的医生，经常翻山越岭地到几十里地以外出诊和为侗族人民注射预防针。
