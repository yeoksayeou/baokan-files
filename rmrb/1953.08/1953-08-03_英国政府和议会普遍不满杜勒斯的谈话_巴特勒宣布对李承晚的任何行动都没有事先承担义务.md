Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch: During the foreign policy debate in the British House of Commons on the 30th, Labor Party leader Clement Attlee spoke out against Dulles's remarks. Attlee said, "I believe everyone was disturbed to hear the news of Mr. Dulles making that statement." It seemed that "the U.S. government had first set conditions for the political conference discussing the Korean issue, without considering the opinions of its partners." "It seems very strange to announce such a policy unilaterally, just as the United Nations General Assembly is about to meet and just as we hope to conduct these discussions." Attlee said: It is "truly extraordinary" that Dulles "actually made such a statement, saying that Korean unification must be achieved, otherwise the U.S. delegation will withdraw from the conference. In my view, this is truly a great violation of the spirit of the United Nations. The implication of this statement is: if everything does not develop exactly as Mr. Dulles hopes, the United States will go its own way. This is a very dangerous attitude." Attlee said that the United States seemed willing to coordinate policies with Syngman Rhee, rather than with other countries participating in the Korean War. Attlee said, "We have the right and responsibility to express our views. I hope we will firmly state that when the conference is convened, we will not be bound by certain narrow restrictions, and we will demand a spirit of full mutual concession at the meeting, and show that our purpose is not just to allow Syngman Rhee to control the entire Korea."

British Acting Prime Minister Butler said in response to questions from members of parliament: "Before Attlee and the opposition expressed their concerns on this issue, the government had the exact same reaction and had already decided to clearly express our position to the U.S. government. Therefore, the government issued instructions to the ambassador to Washington yesterday morning, informing him to clearly express our position to the United States."

Regarding the British government's position if South Korea were to violate the armistice, Butler said: "Let me make it clear, so that there is no doubt in anyone's mind: the British government has absolutely no prior obligation for any actions they may take." "We reserve the complete right to take any action we may deem correct under the circumstances at that time."

Regarding Dulles's statement that the United States might withdraw from the conference with Syngman Rhee after ninety days, Butler said that Britain had absolutely no obligation to withdraw from the conference. He added, "And I want to make it abundantly clear that we hope to consult with our allies before taking any such action." Butler said that if Syngman Rhee took any steps, the British government would consider what actions they should take. He said it was clear that an "extremely serious" situation would arise.

Meanwhile, more British newspapers criticized Dulles's remarks. A Reuters dispatch from London on the 30th said that the British newspapers' dissatisfaction with Dulles was so widespread that the impression one got was that "general British public opinion had taken a unanimous action on this matter." London's "Daily Mirror" asked in the same day's commentary: Is the United States prepared to abandon Britain and the United Nations and fight alone in Korea? The Yorkshire Post said that Dulles's "rigid attitude towards the Far East issue has surprised British public opinion, and this is not the first time." Britain "does not want to see the prospect of a possible agreement undermined by an approach that is easily provocative and implemented at an inappropriate time."

    英国政府和议会普遍不满杜勒斯的谈话
    巴特勒宣布对李承晚的任何行动都没有事先承担义务
    【新华社三十一日讯】在英国议会下院三十日举行的外交辩论中，工党领袖艾德礼发言抨击杜勒斯的谈话。艾德礼说：“我相信，所有的人都因听到杜勒斯先生发表那个谈话的消息而感到不安。”这看来是，“美国政府对讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议先提出了条件，而没有考虑到它的伙伴的意见”。“正当联合国大会要开会的时候，正当我们希望进行这些讨论的时候，这种片面宣布政策看来是很奇怪的。”艾德礼说：杜勒斯“竟然发表这样的谈话，说必须达成朝鲜统一，否则美国代表将退出会议，这看来的确是异乎寻常的。依我看来这真的是非常违反联合国的精神。这个谈话的言外之意是：如果每件事情并不恰恰按照杜勒斯先生所希望的那样发展，美国将自行其是。这是一种非常危险的态度”。艾德礼说：美国似乎愿意与李承晚取得政策上的协调，而不是与其他参加朝鲜战争的国家取得政策上的协调。艾德礼说：“我们有权利和责任提出我们的观点。我希望我们将坚决表示，在会议召开的时候，我们绝不受某些狭隘的限制的束缚，我们将要求会议上有一种充分互让的精神，并表明我们的目的不只是让李承晚来控制整个朝鲜。”
    英国代理首相巴特勒在答复议员们的质问时说：“在艾德礼和反对党在这一问题上表示他们的焦虑以前，政府就有了完全同样的反应，并已经决定向美国政府明确表示我们的立场。因此，政府已在昨天早上发指示给驻华盛顿大使，通知他向美国明确表示我们的立场。”
    巴特勒谈到如果南朝鲜破坏停战时英国政府的立场说：“让我说清楚，使大家没有怀疑：英国政府对于他们可能采取的任何行动都丝毫没有事先承担义务。”“我们保留在那时的情况下采取任何我们可能认为正确的行动的完全权利。”
    在谈到关于杜勒斯说美国有可能在政治会议经过九十天后，和李承晚一起退出会议的问题时，巴特勒说：英国完全没有承担退出会议的义务。他又说：“并且我愿意万分清楚地说明，我们希望在采取任何这种行动以前，一定和我们磋商。”巴特勒说，如果李承晚采取了任何步骤的话，英国政府就会考虑究竟他们要采取什么行动。他说，很显然一种“极端严重”的情况就会发生。
    同时，更多的英国报纸抨击杜勒斯的谈话。路透社伦敦三十日电说：英国报纸对杜勒斯的不满是如此普遍，以致人们得到的印象是：“英国的一般舆论对这件事是采取了一致行动的”。伦敦“每日镜报”在同一天的评论中问道：是否美国准备抛开英国和联合国而单独在朝鲜作战？约克郡邮报说：杜勒斯“对远东问题那种僵硬态度使英国舆论吃惊，这已不是第一次了。”英国“不希望看到可能取得协议的前途被一种在不适当时机推行的容易招惹是非的方针来破坏”。
