    Chenliu County People's Government Construction Section Irresponsible in Promoting Amorpha fruticosa
    Liu Junxian from the Chenliu County Agricultural Technology Guidance Station in Henan writes: Guiding farmers to plant Amorpha fruticosa is the task of the county Construction Section. However, the county Construction Section transported 100 jin of Amorpha fruticosa seeds from Zhengzhou on March 27th, and procrastinated for a whole month, only distributing these seeds to various districts on April 28th and 29th. At that time, cadres and production assistants in various districts reflected that local farmers had never planted this kind of thing before, and requested the Construction Section to quickly issue instructions on cultivation methods so that they could teach the farmers; otherwise, the Amorpha fruticosa might not survive due to improper planting methods, which would not only waste manpower and resources, but also affect the government's credibility. However, the county Construction Section showed serious bureaucratic style, ignoring the opinions of the districts. The instructions on Amorpha fruticosa planting methods are still in the cabinet and have not been distributed (Note: In November 1952, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government printed and distributed pamphlets explaining the planting methods of Amorpha fruticosa to various promotion areas). What is even more ridiculous is that in mid-June, the Construction Section blindly called various districts to inquire whether the Amorpha fruticosa was growing well, and asked the districts to report on their planting experience. In fact, the ten mu of Amorpha fruticosa planted in various districts of the county did not grow a single branch because the Construction Section did not provide guidance on planting methods. I believe that the Chenliu County Construction Section should seriously examine its work style and conscientiously correct it in future work.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    陈留县人民政府建设科对推广紫穗槐工作不负责任
    河南陈留县农业技术指导站刘俊宪来信：指导农民种植紫穗槐，这是县建设科的任务。但我县建设科三月二十七日从郑州运来一百斤紫穗槐种籽，一直拖拉了整整一个月，直到四月二十八日和二十九日才把这些种籽发到各区。当时各区干部和生产助理员都反映说：当地农民从来没有种过这种东西，要求建设科赶快发栽培办法的说明，以便向农民传授；否则紫穗槐可能因种法不对头而不能成活，这不但会浪费人力物力，而且也会影响政府的威信。但是县建设科却表现了严重的官僚主义作风，对各区意见置之不理，紫穗槐种植办法的说明，到现在还在柜子里放着没发下去（按：一九五二年十一月间中央人民政府农业部即向各推广区印发了解说紫穗槐种植办法的小册子）。更可笑的是：六月中旬，建设科还盲目往各区打电话询问紫穗槐出得好不好，并要各区汇报种植的经验。实际上，全县各区种的十亩紫穗槐，因为建设科没有指导种植方法，连一枝也没有长出来。我认为：陈留县建设科应认真检查一下工作作风，并在今后工作中切实加以改正。
