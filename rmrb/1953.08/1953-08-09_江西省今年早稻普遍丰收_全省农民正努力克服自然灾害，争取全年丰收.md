    Jiangxi Province's early rice has achieved a universal bumper harvest this year. Except for a small number of areas that suffered losses due to varying degrees of flooding, the vast majority of areas have achieved harvests unprecedented in recent years. In mid-July, the Ganzhou Special District focused on checking the early rice harvest in Ganxian, Dayu, and Ningdu counties. Generally, production increased by about 8 to 15 percent compared to last year. The Ji'an Special District, including some flooded fields, can increase production by 7 percent, with Suichuan County increasing by 13 percent. The Shangrao Special District, including flooded fields, can also increase production by 8 percent. The early rice harvest in Nanchang Special District and Fuzhou Special District is roughly the same. From the perspective of the entire province, if including the affected fields, the minimum increase can be about 7 percent based on the average early rice yield of last year.
    Harvesting has generally begun in most parts of the province, and reports of bumper harvests are frequently received. The vast countryside presents a scene of joyful agricultural activity. Many farmers have reported that this year's early rice stalks are thick, the ears are long, and the grains are golden, full, and plump, a good harvest that has not been seen in recent years.
    After the comprehensive completion of the land reform movement in the province last winter and this spring, the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers has greatly increased. Under the correct leadership of the CCP Central Committee and the Central South Bureau of the CCP, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the CCP was able to promptly shift to spring plowing and production, regarding agricultural production as the overriding central task in the countryside. It actively led the masses in the struggle against various natural disasters. Combined with spring plowing and production, it vigorously publicized among the masses the various basic policies of the CCP Central Committee and the Central South Bureau regarding agricultural production. This dispelled the various concerns that some farmers had about developing agricultural production, and their production enthusiasm was further enhanced. Education on the guidelines and policies related to agricultural production was conducted among cadres in a timely manner, so that some cadres who were not at ease in rural work in the past have now basically stabilized. In terms of leadership, emphasis was placed on centralization and unity, and the decentralism, subjectivism, and bureaucratism existing in some leading organs and leading cadres were severely criticized. Attention was also paid to improving the methods of leading agricultural production, and the phenomenon of "excessive tasks" in rural areas was basically overcome. Timely attention was paid to correcting the tendencies of impetuosity and recklessness or laissez-faire in the production movement and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, so that the province's mutual aid and cooperation movement could develop steadily and healthily. Because of the adoption of the above series of work and measures, it was guaranteed that all efforts were concentrated on doing a good job in spring plowing and production, ensuring this year's early rice bumper harvest throughout the province.
    Year after year of bumper harvests have greatly increased the purchasing power of the broad masses of farmers. According to statistics from the Provincial Department of Commerce, the province's purchasing power last year increased by 14.2 percent compared to the previous year. After this year's early rice harvest, purchasing power will inevitably increase even more. At present, state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in various places, under the direct leadership of party committees and people's governments at all levels, are working hard to help farmers sell grain, supply the needs of urban workers, citizens, and the state; and to prevent illegal merchants from taking advantage of the new grain market to depress grain prices, seek exorbitant profits, engage in speculation and sabotage, they are tensely carrying out grain purchase work in various places. The masses of farmers are very satisfied with the government's measures to appropriately increase grain prices this year, and are full of confidence in continuing to strive for increased grain production throughout the year.

    江西省今年早稻普遍丰收
    全省农民正努力克服自然灾害，争取全年丰收
    江西省的早稻今年普遍丰收。除少部分地区因遭受轻重水灾受损失外，绝大部分地区的收成是近几年来所未有的。赣州专区在七月中旬重点检查了赣县、大庾、宁都三县早稻的收成情况，一般均可在去年的基础上增产百分之八到百分之十五左右不等。吉安专区包括一部分受水灾的田在内，可增产百分之七，其中遂川县可增产百分之十三；上饶专区包括受水灾的田也可增产百分之八；南昌专区、抚州专区的早稻收成大致相同。从全省来看，如果包括受灾田亩在内，最低可在去年早稻平均产量的基础上，增产百分之七左右。
    全省大部分地区已普遍开始收割，丰收喜报频传，广大农村呈现一片农忙喜悦的景象。许多农民反映：今年早禾禾杆粗，穗子长，谷粒金黄饱满，是几年来没有过的好收成。
    该省去冬今春全面结束土地改革运动以后，广大农民群众的生产积极性大为提高。中共江西省委在中共中央、中南局的正确领导下，又能及时地转入春耕生产，将农业生产作为农村压倒一切的中心任务，积极地领导了群众与各种自然灾害作斗争。并结合春耕生产，在群众中较普遍地大力宣传了中共中央、中南局有关农业生产的各项基本政策，使一部分农民解除了对发展农业生产所存在的各种顾虑，生产积极性进一步有了提高。在干部中较及时的进行了有关农业生产的方针、政策教育，使一部分过去不安心农村工作的干部现在已基本上稳定下来。在领导上强调了集中统一，严厉批判了某些领导机关与领导干部中所存在的分散主义、主观主义与官僚主义，并注意改进对农业生产的领导方法，基本上克服了乡村中的“五多”现象。及时注意纠正生产运动与互助合作运动中的急躁冒进与放任自流的倾向，使全省的互助合作运动得以稳步地、健康地发展。由于采取了上述一系列的工作与措施，因而保证了集中全力搞好春耕生产，保证了今年全省的早稻丰收。
    一年紧接一年的丰收，使广大农民的购买力大大提高，据省商业厅统计：去年全省购买力比前年增加了百分之十四点二，今年早稻收割以后，购买力必将有更大增加。目前各地国营粮食部门与合作社在各级党委和各级人民政府的直接领导下，为了帮助农民销售粮食，供给城市工人、市民和国家需要；并防止不法商人利用新粮上市压低粮价，牟取暴利，投机捣把，正在各地紧张地进行粮食收购工作。农民群众对政府今年适当的提高粮价的措施非常满意。并对继续争取全年粮食增产充满了信心。
