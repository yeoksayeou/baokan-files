Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 15th: TASS Moscow, August 14th: The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Trade Union of Workers in the Light and Food Industries of the Soviet Union closed on August 13th.  N. Rizhov, Deputy Minister of the Light and Food Industries of the Soviet Union, spoke at the meeting about the plan to increase the production of consumer goods in the coming years.

He said that light and food industry enterprises will produce an additional 10 billion rubles worth of goods this year.  Production will continue to expand in the coming years. By 1954, the output of woolen fabrics will be more than double that of the pre-war year of 1940; the output in 1955 will reach 250 million meters; and in 1956, it will reach 290 million meters. The output of rayon fabrics will also increase rapidly: 440 million meters of rayon fabrics will be produced in 1954, which is seven and a half times that of 1940; and it will reach 600 million meters by 1956. The outer garments, suits, and other clothing manufactured in 1956 will be two and a half times that of 1953. The output of knitted goods, shoes, and other items will be greatly increased.

Rizhov also spoke in detail about the construction of new enterprises in the light and food industries. He said that a large number of textile, clothing, shoe, and other factories will be built in many cities in the Soviet Union. A giant silk weaving factory is being built in Kalinin, which can produce 21 million meters of fabric annually. Many textile factories will be built in Minsk and Sverdlovsk; many woolen factories will be built in cities such as Kansk and Ivanovo. The production capacity of existing enterprises will also be greatly increased.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 15th: The decision of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government on rapidly increasing the production of consumer goods for the people has been warmly welcomed by the Soviet people. In recent days, many enterprises have held staff and worker meetings to discuss various ways to further expand the production of consumer goods, increase their variety, and improve quality and reduce costs.

The "Pravda" and "Moscow Pravda" newspapers reported in detail on the 14th about the situation of the staff and worker meeting held recently at the Moscow Three Mountains Textile Mill, one of the oldest and largest textile complexes in the Soviet Union. Representatives from the Ministry of Light and Food Industries of the Soviet Union, Soviet trade organizations, and textile industry scientific research institutions also attended the meeting. The meeting discussed the resolutions of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the tasks of all staff and workers of the complex.

After the chairman of the factory trade union committee, Dubyaga, announced the opening of the meeting, Chief Engineer Mirnikov gave a report. He said that the Three Mountains Textile Mill now produces more than 700,000 meters of various textiles every day, and the variety of textiles has also been greatly improved. For example, in the first half of this year, the output of rayon fabrics has increased to 3.2 times that of 1950, and 20 times that of the pre-war period. In the second half of this year, these textiles and spun yarn textiles will be further increased; measures will be taken to increase the production volume in the third quarter to more than five times that of the first quarter of this year. By the end of this year, the factory will produce more than 16 million meters of fabric woven from spun yarn and 1.175 million meters of window纱. Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his speech at the Supreme Soviet meeting that although consumer goods produced by Soviet industry are usually known for their durability, there are still many areas that need to be improved in terms of refinement and style. Mirnikov said that the main task of the Three Mountains Textile Mill in the future is to do its best to improve the quality of its products. Mirnikov then reported on the specific measures taken by the factory management in this regard and asked all staff and workers to work together to ensure that the textiles produced are not only the most durable but also the most beautiful.

The staff and workers had a heated discussion on the report at the meeting. Those who spoke at the meeting included workshop directors, production team leaders, laboratory directors, chief accountants, representatives of central department stores, etc. They warmly supported the resolutions of the Supreme Soviet meeting and Comrade Malenkov's speech, sharply criticized the shortcomings in the factory's work, unanimously believed that the factory has the potential to produce more, better, and more beautiful textiles, and put forward many suggestions for realizing this possibility. Representatives of the Ministry of Light and Food Industries of the Soviet Union announced at the meeting that the Soviet government will refit the spinning factory of the Three Mountains Textile Mill with the latest machinery, and the weaving factory will also be greatly rebuilt.

The staff and worker meeting finally adopted a resolution. The resolution stated that all staff and workers will take the policies of the Party and the government put forward in the resolutions of the Supreme Soviet meeting and Comrade Malenkov's speech as the basis for the work of all staff and workers. All staff and workers guarantee to complete the 1953 production plan ahead of schedule and overproduce 5 tons of yarn, 400,000 meters of cloth, and 500,000 meters of textiles. They also guarantee to make high-quality products account for 92% of all products, increase the variety of well-processed textiles in the second half of this year, increase the production of rayon fabrics, spun yarn cloth, window纱, and stop producing textiles with unpopular styles, save 30 tons of cotton and 5 tons of yarn, and guarantee to save 1.25 million rubles from reducing costs this year. The meeting also assured the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government that it is determined to fulfill the task of supplying the people with high-quality and beautiful textiles.

    苏联大力增加消费品的产量
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：苏联轻工业和食品工业工人工会中央委员会全体会议，已在八月十三日闭幕。苏联轻工业和食品工业部副部长纳·里饶夫，在会上谈到了在今后几年中增加消费品产量的计划。
    他说，今年各轻工业和食品工业企业将额外生产价值达一百亿卢布的物品。在今后几年内，生产将继续扩大。到一九五四年，毛织品的产量将为战前一九四○年的二倍多；一九五五年的产量将达二亿五千万公尺；一九五六年将达二亿九千万公尺。人造丝织品的产量也将迅速增加：一九五四年将生产四亿四千万公尺人造丝织品，为一九四○年的七倍半；到一九五六年将达六亿公尺。一九五六年制造的外衣、成套衣服和其他服装，将为一九五三年的二倍半。针织品、鞋类和其他物品的产量都将大大地增加。
    里饶夫还详细地谈到了建设轻工业和食品工业的新企业的问题。他说：在苏联许多城市中将建立大批纺织、服装、鞋类及其他工厂。加里宁城正在建设一个巨型的丝织厂，它每年可以生产二千一百万公尺的织品。明斯克和斯维德洛夫斯克将建立许多纺织工厂；坎斯克和伊凡诺佛等城将建造许多毛织工厂。现有各企业的生产能力也将大大地增加。
    【新华社莫斯科十五日电】苏联共产党和政府关于迅速增加人民消费品的生产的决定，受到苏联人民的热烈欢迎。这些天来，许多企业纷纷举行职工大会，讨论出种种办法来进一步扩大消费品的生产，增加它们的种类，并改进质量和减低成本。
    “真理报”和“莫斯科真理报”在十四日详细介绍了苏联一个历史最悠久、规模最大的纺织联合工厂——莫斯科三山纺织厂日前举行职工大会的情形。苏联轻工业和食品工业部、苏联贸易机关和纺织工业科学研究机关等的代表，都参加了这个大会。大会讨论的问题是：苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议的决议和本联合工厂全体职工的任务。
    工厂工会委员会主席杜比亚加宣布开会后，由总工程师米尔尼科夫作报告。他说：现在三山纺织厂每天生产七十万公尺以上的各种纺织品，纺织品的种类也有了很大的改进。例如，今年上半年人造丝织品的产量已增加为一九五○年的三点二倍，为战前的二十倍。今年下半年还将进一步增产这些纺织品和卷纱的纺织品；要采取办法使第三季的生产量为今年第一季的五倍多。到今年年底，工厂将生产一千六百万多公尺卷纱织成的布，生产一百一十七万五千公尺窗纱。马林科夫同志在最高苏维埃会议上的演说中曾经指出，苏联工业生产的消费品虽然通常都以经久耐用著称，但在精致和式样方面还有很多地方尚待改进。米尔尼科夫说，三山纺织厂今后的主要任务就是尽力提高产品的质量。米尔尼科夫接着报告了工厂经理部门在这方面所采取的具体措施，并请全体职工共同想办法来保证使出产的纺织品不仅是最耐用的而且是最美观的。
    职工们在会上对报告进行了热烈的讨论。在会上发言的人有：车间主任、生产组长、化验室主任、总会计、中央百货公司的代表等。他们热烈地拥护最高苏维埃会议的决议和马林科夫同志的演说，并尖锐地批评了工厂工作中的缺点，一致认为工厂有可能出产更多、更好和更美观的纺织品，并提出了许多实现这种可能性的建议。苏联轻工业和食品工业部代表在会上通知说：苏联政府将以最新式的机器来改装三山纺织厂的纺纱工厂，织布工厂也将大大改建。
    职工大会最后通过了一项决议。决议表示：全体职工将把苏联最高苏维埃会议的决议和马林科夫同志的演说中所提出的党和政府的政策，作为全体职工工作的基础。全体职工保证要提前完成一九五三年生产计划，超额生产五吨纱、四十万公尺布料、五十万公尺纺织品。他们并保证要使优等产品占全部产品的百分之九十二，在今年下半年增加很好地整理过的纺织品的种类，增产人造丝织品、卷纱布、窗纱，并停止生产式样不受欢迎的纺织品，节约三十吨棉花、五吨纱，保证今年从减低成本中节约一百二十五万卢布。大会并向苏联共产党和政府保证，坚决要实现供给人民以质量高的、美观的纺织品的任务。
