Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: The National Higher Industrial School Administrative Conference was held from July 15th to August 3rd. Based on the general guideline of "Rectification and Consolidation, Key Development, Improving Quality, and Steady Progress" for education construction in 1953, the conference determined the specific direction and methods for higher industrial education work in the future and passed the "Resolution on Steadily Carrying Out Teaching Reform and Gradually Improving Teaching Quality."

During the conference, Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government and Vice Chairman Xi Zhongxun of the Government Administration Council's Cultural and Educational Committee made important instructions. Vice Chairman Jia Tuofu of the State Planning Commission gave a report on the national economic construction plan. At the opening of the conference, Minister Ma Xulun of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Higher Education gave a report on "The Basic Situation of Higher Education in the Country and the Future Direction and Work," and Vice Minister Zeng Zhaolun of the Central Ministry of Higher Education gave a report on "The Issue of Steadily Implementing Teaching Reform." The presidents, deans (or academic affairs directors) of various higher industrial schools, and representatives from educational administrative departments and relevant industrial departments, based on these instructions and reports, combined with the actual work situation and existing problems, conducted in-depth discussions. The conference first affirmed the achievements of higher industrial education work over the past three years, especially since the ideological remolding of teachers in higher industrial schools, the adjustment of departments and disciplines, and the work of teaching reform. Teachers and students in various schools have actively worked hard and delved into their subjects, and progress has been made in all aspects of work. At the same time, the shortcomings of higher industrial education work over the past three years were further clarified, mainly that the development of schools had a blind and impulsive nature, manifested in emphasizing quantity over quality, demanding too much too quickly, considering needs more than possible conditions, and many measures exceeded subjective strength, resulting in great difficulties in school work. The conference determined that the specific direction for improving higher industrial education work in the future is: We must earnestly implement the principle of "Rectification and Consolidation, Key Development, Improving Quality, and Steady Progress," vigorously reverse the tendency of emphasizing quantity over quality, seeking excessive and hasty progress, taking into account both needs and possibilities, and making steady progress on the basis of consolidation. The training of cadres must strive to adapt to the needs of national industrial construction, first ensuring the supply of technical cadres in heavy industry, national defense industry, and closely related fields such as geology and architecture.

The conference believes that the most serious phenomenon in current higher industrial education work is the excessive teaching tasks, excessive tension and pressure on teachers and students, poor health conditions, and poor learning and digestion by students. The conference analyzed the reasons for the excessive tension and pressure in teaching work and for teachers and students, and believed that the main reason lies in the excessively high and hasty demands of the educational administrative leading departments on teaching reform work. This is concentrated in the excessively high training objectives and teaching plans, and the teaching load is too heavy, almost taking the current Soviet standards as the standard. The reasons for these deviations are mainly that the educational administrative leading departments have serious subjectivity, insufficient understanding of the complexity and long-term nature of teaching reform, and insufficient analysis and estimation of the current specific conditions of teachers, equipment, and student levels in schools, as well as the unbalanced development of work. The conference believes that the key to overcoming the current phenomenon of excessive tension and pressure in universities is to vigorously correct the tendency of demanding too much too quickly in teaching reform, while paying attention to preventing and opposing the conservative ideology of stagnation, learning from the Soviet Union in combination with China's actual conditions, and proposing different requirements and progress for teaching reform according to different situations and conditions, in order to implement teaching reform steadily and resolutely with a realistic spirit.

The conference believes that the reform of higher education is a reform from bourgeois ideology-led, semi-colonial higher education that serves the declining reactionary ruling class to higher education that is led by the working class ideology, serves the people, and serves national construction, especially industrial construction. Teaching reform is a reform of the essence of education. It is a complex, long-term, and arduous struggle process, and it is also a process of continuous and in-depth ideological remolding of teachers and continuous improvement of scientific and technological levels. The conference determined that the order of various important tasks in the teaching reform of higher industrial schools is generally: First, clarify the training objectives of the majors, and formulate (or revise) the teaching plan according to the training objectives, and then formulate (or revise) the teaching syllabus including the purpose, requirements and content points of the course according to the status and role of each course in the teaching plan, and finally compile teaching materials according to the teaching syllabus. However, this order cannot be understood mechanically, as they interact with each other. The conference determined the training objectives of higher industrial schools, in principle, the undergraduate program is to train engineers suitable for China's specific conditions and scientific and technological level (which is the title of the graduates and not the position). However, under the current conditions, it will take a certain period of effort to truly achieve such training objectives. The training objective of the specialized courses should refer to the resolution of the Third Teaching Research Work Conference of Harbin Institute of Technology in February this year, which is to train relatively senior technicians.

Regarding teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, teaching materials, and teaching and research office work, the conference made some specific regulations. The conference emphasized that actively uniting and improving existing teachers and vigorously training new teachers are the keys to implementing teaching reform and improving teaching quality. We must adopt a policy of actively uniting and helping to improve old teachers. Those who have wrongly implemented the policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals must be seriously criticized; those teachers who are progressing slowly must be patiently helped and should not be impatient; young teachers must be vigorously trained and promoted; it must be clear that old teachers have the responsibility to guide young teachers, and young teachers should humbly learn from old teachers, educate students to respect teachers, and strengthen the unity of new and old teachers and cooperation between teachers and students. The conference believes that regular and systematic study of Marxism-Leninism is a necessary condition for continuously improving teachers' political level and improving the political and ideological nature of teaching, but it should be recognized that this is a long-term task, which should not be rushed, and should be carried out on the basis of conscious voluntarism.

The conference also discussed specific issues such as the adjustment of departments and disciplines, the establishment of majors, enrollment work, and the allocation plan for teaching assistants and graduate students in various schools. The problems that could be solved have been solved by the Central Ministry of Higher Education. The conference also made preliminary studies on the development direction and scale of various schools in the next five years, so that various schools can consider formulating longer-term plans.

This conference also reviewed the leadership work of higher education. The conference pointed out that there has been a lack of clear instructions on the nature, direction, steps, and methods of teaching reform in the past year; there have been more general calls and less specific guidance; ideological leadership has been insufficient; plans and tasks have been issued late, and there have been many and urgent temporary tasks; the responsibilities of various departments and levels of school leadership have not been clear enough; and there have also been shortcomings in the leadership style, such as procrastination and slow resolution of problems. Vice Minister Yang Xiufeng of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Higher Education made a concluding report at the closing of the conference. In his concluding report, he focused on putting forward opinions on improving leadership. He pointed out that to improve future leadership work, it is necessary to implement the anti-bureaucracy struggle well, thoroughly understand the situation, sum up experience, strengthen political theory study, and improve leadership skills. In terms of leadership methods, learn to be good at grasping key points and concentrate efforts to solve key problems. He said: We must further rely on the help of the local CCP committees and governments to strengthen the ideological leadership, political work, and personnel work of various schools. He called for vigorously strengthening the unified leadership of schools, further overcoming various uncoordinated phenomena from within or outside the schools that hinder teaching order, and must change the style of "carrying out movements" and replace it with a steady, down-to-earth, and in-depth research atmosphere. He said: In the future, the Central Ministry of Higher Education must: First, seize the issue of improving and training teachers; strengthen specific leadership of teaching work such as formulating or revising teaching plans and teaching syllabuses; and regularly and systematically check work so as to be able to understand the situation in a timely manner, correctly decide on problems, spread good experience, and quickly correct the shortcomings and errors of leadership. Second, pay attention to giving play to the enthusiasm and initiative of various relevant business departments, localities, and schools. Third, in conjunction with relevant parties, study and determine the development direction and scale of various schools according to the needs of national construction, so that school work can be stabilized and can move forward steadily according to plan.

During the conference, there was also an exchange of teaching reform experiences, and an exhibition of compiled teaching materials from various schools was held.

    全国高等工业学校行政会议
    确定高等工业教育的方针
    稳步进行教学改革逐步提高教学质量
    【新华社九日讯】全国高等工业学校行政会议已在七月十五日至八月三日举行，会议根据一九五三年教育建设“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的总方针，确定了今后高等工业教育工作的具体方针和作法，通过了“关于稳步进行教学改革逐步提高教学质量”的决议。
    在会议进程中，中央人民政府朱德副主席、政务院文化教育委员会习仲勋副主任都到会作了重要指示，国家计划委员会贾拓夫副主席作了关于国家经济建设计划的报告。会议开幕时，中央人民政府高等教育部马叙伦部长作了“关于全国高等教育的基本情况和今后的方针与工作”的报告，中央高等教育部曾昭抡副部长作了“关于稳步贯彻教学改革问题”的报告。参加会议的各高等工业学校校长、院长（或教务长）和教育行政部门、有关产业部门的代表，根据这些指示和报告，结合实际工作的情况和存在着的问题，进行了深入的讨论。会议首先肯定了三年来高等工业教育工作的成绩，特别是在高等工业学校教师思想改造、院系调整和教学改革工作以来，各校师生员工积极努力，辛苦钻研，各方面工作都前进了一大步。同时，也进一步明确了三年来高等工业教育工作的缺点，主要是学校的发展带有盲目冒进性，表现在重量轻质，要求过急，照顾需要方面多，考虑可能条件少，不少措施超过了主观力量，以致造成学校工作中很大困难。会议确定今后改进高等工业教育工作的具体方针是：必须切实贯彻“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的方针，大力扭转重量轻质、贪多冒进、要求过急的偏向，兼顾需要与可能，在巩固的基础上稳步前进。培养干部必须力求与国家工业建设的需要相适应，首先保证重工业、国防工业及与此密切相关的地质、建筑等方面的技术干部的供应。
    会议认为当前高等工业教育工作中最严重的现象是教学任务过重，师生过分紧张忙迫，健康情况不佳，学生学习消化不良。会议分析了造成教学工作与师生过分紧张忙迫的原因，认为最主要的原因在于教育行政领导部门对教学改革工作要求过高过急，这集中表现在培养目标、教学计划订得过高，教学分量显得过重，差不多是以苏联现行标准为标准。产生这些偏向的原因，主要是教育行政领导部门存在严重的主观性，对教学改革的复杂性长期性认识不足，对学校当前师资、设备、学生程度等具体条件及工作发展的不平衡性分析估计不够。会议认为克服当前高等学校过分紧张忙迫现象的关键问题，在于大力纠正对教学改革要求过高过急的偏向，同时注意防止与反对停滞不前的保守思想，结合中国实际学习苏联，根据不同情况不同条件，提出教学改革的不同要求和进度，以实事求是的精神，稳步而坚决地贯彻教学改革。
    会议认为高等教育的改革是从资产阶级思想领导的、半殖民地的、为没落的反动统治阶级服务的高等教育，改革为工人阶级思想领导的、为人民大众的、为国家建设特别是为工业建设服务的高等教育。教学改革是教育本质的改革，是一个复杂的、长期的艰苦奋斗的过程，也是教师思想改造继续深入、科学技术水平不断提高的过程。会议确定了高等工业学校教学改革中各项重要工作的顺序一般是：首先明确专业的培养目标，并根据培养目标拟订（或修订）教学计划，然后根据教学计划中各门课程的地位与作用，拟订（或修订）包括该课程目的、要求与内容要点的教学大纲，最后根据教学大纲编写教材。但不能机械了解这种顺序，它们是相互发生作用的。会议确定高等工业学校培养目标，本科原则上是培养适合中国具体情况和科学技术水平的工程师（是毕业生的称号而不是职位）。但在目前条件下，真正达到这样的培养目标，还须经过一定时期的努力。专修科的培养目标，应参照今年二月哈尔滨工业大学第三届教学研究工作会议的决议规定，为培养较高级技术员。
    关于教学计划、教学大纲、教材和教研室工作等，会议都作了若干具体规定。会议强调指出：积极团结提高现有师资和大力培养新师资，是贯彻教学改革提高教学质量的关键。对老教师必须采取积极团结与帮助提高的方针。对一些错误地执行团结改造知识分子政策的人，必须严肃批评；对某些进步较慢的教师，必须耐心帮助，不可急躁；对青年教师必须大力培养提拔，必须明确老教师有责任指导青年教师，青年教师应向老教师虚心学习，教育学生尊重教师，加强新老教师的团结和师生合作。会议认为经常地系统地学习马克思列宁主义是不断提高教师政治水平，提高教学政治思想性的必要条件，但应认识这是长期的工作，不能求之过急，并应在自觉自愿的基础上进行。
    会议对各校有关院系调整、专业设置、招生工作、助教和研究生分配计划等具体问题也进行了讨论，其中可能解决的问题已由中央高等教育部予以解决。会议对于各校今后五年内发展方向和发展规模也作了初步研究，以便各校可以考虑制订较长时期的计划。
    这次会议还检查了高等教育的领导工作，会议指出：一年来对教学改革的性质、方针、步骤、作法缺乏明确指示；一般号召多，具体指导少；思想领导不够；计划任务下达迟，临时任务多而紧；对学校领导关系各部各级职责不够明确；领导作风上也有拖拉迟缓解决问题不及时等缺点。中央人民政府高等教育部杨秀峰副部长在会议闭幕时作了总结报告。他在总结报告中着重提出了改进领导的意见。他指出改进今后领导工作，要很好地贯彻反官僚主义斗争，深入了解情况，总结经验，加强政治理论学习，提高领导水平。在领导方法上学会善于掌握重点，集中力量解决关键性的问题。他说：必须进一步依靠各地中共党委和政府的帮助，以加强各校的思想领导、政治工作、人事工作。他号召大力加强学校的统一领导，进一步克服来自校内或校外的有碍教学秩序的各种不协调现象，必须改变“搞运动”的作风，代之以稳步踏实、深入钻研的风气。他说：今后中央高等教育部必须：第一抓紧提高与培养师资问题；加强对教学工作如制定或修订教学计划、教学大纲等的具体领导；及定期地有计划地检查工作等以达能及时了解情况，正确决定问题，传播好的经验，并迅速纠正领导的缺点与错误。第二注意发挥各有关业务部门、地方及学校的积极性与主动性。第三会同有关方面，根据国家建设的需要，研究与确定各学校的发展方向与规模，使学校工作稳定下来，能按着计划稳步地前进。
    会议期间，还组织了教学改革经验的交流，并举办了各校编译教材的展览。
