To Our Beloved Volunteer Comrades:

Almost three years have passed since we parted, and I miss you all the time, thinking of every moving and thrilling battle you fought, and your great contributions to world peace, the construction of our motherland, and our studies. Every student says, "If it weren't for the heroic battles of the Volunteer Army, we wouldn't have such peaceful studies!" Especially now, when the flames of war in Korea have been extinguished thanks to your heroic struggle, my heart turns to you completely. I feel I have so much to tell you, and I feel there are so many things about our motherland that you need to know. The things I want to tell you may be a bit trivial, but because these things moved me and educated me, and because they are familiar things that I have personally experienced, I think you will also enjoy hearing about them!

I was originally a student at the Jiangsu Provincial School of Finance and Economics in Yangzhou and was recently assigned to work for the North China Construction Engineering Company of the First Ministry of Machine Building. Let me talk about some of the conditions in our school!

In the last ten days of April this year, we held graduation exams. The results of the graduation exams were as follows: among the 387 graduating students, 38.6 percent had a total average score of 90 or above; 56.7 percent had a score of 85 or above; and the remaining students all scored above 75. Among these students, 67 students achieved a total average score of 95 or above over the three years.

Why were we able to get such excellent scores?

Student Liu Guangpei wrote on the first page of his "Industrial Bookkeeping Accounting" notes: "If you love your motherland, then you must study it well!" It turns out that this student had disliked this subject for a long time in the past, was not very interested in listening to lectures, and did not score well. The closer he got to graduation, the more upset he felt. He thought: "I am about to join the ranks of the motherland's economic construction. How can I take on this great task if I continue like this? Suppose I am a dispatcher in a power plant, and I am not focused at work. For example, if I forget to flip a switch, how many people will be plunged into darkness, and how many factories will have to stop production..." He didn't dare to continue thinking. "Lack of concentration is such an intolerable crime against the motherland!" In this way, he changed his wrong attitude of disinterest in "Industrial Bookkeeping Accounting" and achieved excellent academic results.

The word "motherland" is no longer an abstract noun for us, but has rich, vibrant content. It is so亲切 (qinqie - warm, affectionate), so appealing to people's hearts! Whether it is the emergence of a new industrial production record or the birth and growth of an agricultural production cooperative, it can arouse our deep affection for it and directly encourage us to move forward.

I remember one Sunday, I was chatting with a classmate from the Appropriation Supervision Department, and he suddenly said to me: "As soon as I open the newspaper, I see that there's an oil field discovered here, or an iron mine discovered there, and basic construction is going on everywhere. Every time I read the newspaper, I always feel a kind of indescribable emotion, as if the motherland is urging me, no, ordering me to study hard, study hard!" "You say," he paused, "Decheng, didn't you study 'Basic Construction' in your enterprise accounting class? Look, can basic construction be carried out without talents in the field of appropriation supervision? Then, how can I not love this subject, how can I not study hard?"

Once, Wang Zhenyu was compiling a commodity sales plan table, and the final numbers just wouldn't add up. An hour, two hours... passed, and other students had completed this assignment and gone to rest. At this time, he thought: "Wouldn't it be quickly solved if I just checked it with someone else?" However, as soon as this thought arose, he immediately dismissed it. He remembered the scene when Zoya refused Shura's help when doing algebra problems and persisted for an entire evening, and he also remembered the solemn oath he made not long ago before Comrade Stalin's portrait: "To learn the strong will and spirit of overcoming difficulties of Soviet youth to treat my own studies." "I am about to work for the motherland. If the numbers don't add up then, who will I check with?" He said to himself in this way. Then, he seemed to be ordering himself: "I am a glorious member of the Communist Youth League. I shouldn't rely on others, and I shouldn't steal the fruits of other people's labor..." Later, the plan table was finally completed perfectly, and he told me with a smile: "Only after laboring will you feel happy!"

The reason why we love our motherland so much is because we love our own lives, and our school life is indeed pleasant and happy enough. We have first-class Soviet textbooks, complete teaching plans and syllabuses, tireless teachers, mutually supportive and loving classmates, and even more Party and League organizations that help us improve our political awareness and guide us forward. In the morning, we do radio exercises on the wide playground, accompanied by beautiful music, to exercise our bodies; during the day, we devote ourselves to intensive study to improve ourselves; and when we encounter holidays and festivals, life is even more enjoyable. Some row boats on the Slender West Lake, while others look out from the Five Pavilion Bridge and Ping Mountain Hall, singing loudly and laughing heartily! Everyone is intoxicated by the beautiful present and looks forward to an even happier future. A new morality is gradually cultivated among the students by the beautiful life. Everyone loves the motherland, and they also love the talents nurtured by the motherland—their own classmates. Hu Youlan suffered from a serious illness last semester and did not attend school for more than half a semester. Unable to catch up with her studies, she became a little discouraged. Everyone ran to comfort and encourage her. The League organization also held a special meeting to study how to provide her with concrete assistance. Because there were too many people who wanted to help her review her lessons, the organization designated the two students in the class with the best grades and who were usually closer to her to take on this task. Although this was decided, other students often went to ask her: "Do you have any questions? Let's discuss them together!" Often for a small question, students would spend an hour or two explaining it to her until she thoroughly understood it. In this way, Hu Youlan quickly caught up with her studies. The students' concern and help made her both moved and uneasy. Everyone told her: "If a classmate doesn't study well, it is a loss to the country in nurturing us. Helping you is equivalent to contributing a share of strength to the country. Because the motherland is waiting for you!"

Dear comrades, let me tell you about how we obey the unified allocation of the motherland!

A young girl, Liu Lianzhen, who is striving to join the League, wrote in her letter of determination: "Resolutely obey the unified allocation of the motherland and happily and consciously go to the posts where the motherland needs me most. Whether it is a city or a village, a desert or a plain, a mountain or a coast, a factory, a mine, a company, a cooperative..., the needs of the motherland and the people are my ideals, my personal aspirations!"

This letter of determination was not easy to produce. Liu Lianzhen had been in a pampered environment since she was a child, and her mother especially loved and spoiled her. Before this unified allocation work, her mother put forward two conditions for her job assignment: one was not to leave her hometown of Yangzhou, and the other was to work in a factory. In this way, mother and daughter could see each other often, and daughter would not suffer.

Liu Lianzhen did waver at first, and a struggle occurred in her mind. But she thought: "Who doesn't have a mother's love, whose family isn't warm?"

"Then, why did Huang Jiguang use his body to block the enemy's machine gun? Why could Qiu Shaoyun persevere in the flames for more than twenty minutes until he sacrificed his precious life? Zhao Yiman, Liu Hulan... why were they so heroic and unyielding, and generously sacrificed themselves? Didn't their families have enough warmth, didn't their mothers love them?"

"No, that's not it!" She concluded with certainty. Their families were just as warm, and their mothers loved them just as much. But their enemies—the enemies of our motherland—did not allow them to narrowly accept their mother's love or accept the warmth of their families. That's why they abandoned everything, sacrificed their lives, and let all the sons and daughters forever bathe in the mother's love and the warmth of their families!" The correct answer was obtained, and she couldn't help but smile happily. Finally, she resolutely made a decision: "I want to use my mother's love for me to love my motherland. Obeying the unified allocation of the motherland is my concrete action to love my mother!" Then, she told her mother the heroic stories of you in Korea, the beautiful scenery of the country's future construction, and the reasons for obeying the unified allocation of the motherland. Over time, her mother's thinking also became enlightened, and she automatically abandoned her original two conditions and began to happily pack her daughter's luggage, preparing to joyfully send her daughter to the construction posts where the motherland needed her!

Once, I joked with classmate Lu Zujie and said: "Do you hope to work with your lover, Huang Shumin?" "Does that need to be asked," he replied, "A lover, who doesn't hope to be together?" I teased him again: "Didn't you tell everyone in the group meeting that you don't need the organization to take care of your lover's problem?" "Don't need doesn't mean don't hope!" He suddenly became serious, as if he was educating me, and continued: "That is to say... in a word, you can't place love for your lover above love for the motherland. Besides, I am still a member of the Communist Youth League, and members of the Communist Youth League should have this awareness and should play a leading role!" He paused, and then said with a smile: "We are all still young. If, in a year or two, we have both achieved something in our work and made some contributions to the motherland, how sweet and pleasant it will be to meet again then!"

In this way, the unified allocation work of the motherland was successfully completed in our school. On the eve of leaving school, when everyone bid farewell in the school's temporary auditorium, Qionghua Temple, they made a common oath: "Today we part in Qionghua Temple, and tomorrow we will meet in Tiananmen Square!"

Comrades, we sincerely hope that when we meet in Tiananmen Square, we can also see you. Then we can have a hearty talk about everything. Let us join hands and work hard together on the posts of defending the motherland and building the motherland!

### 祖国在召唤

    祖国在召唤
    李德诚亲爱的志愿军同志们：
    分别将近三年了，我无时无刻不在思念你们，思念你们进行的每一次可歌可泣惊心动魄的战斗，思念你们对世界和平、对祖国建设以及对我们学习深造所做的伟大贡献。同学们谁不说“没有志愿军的英勇战斗，就没有我们的安静学习呢”！特别是现在，当朝鲜的战火，由于你们的英勇奋斗已被扑灭了的时候，我的心更完全转向了你们，我觉得有很多很多的话要给你们说，我觉得祖国有很多很多的事情你们需要知道。我要告诉你们的事情，也许有点琐碎，但是，因为这些事感动了我，教育了我，它又是我亲身经历过的熟悉的事，我想你们也会喜欢听听吧！
    我原是扬州的江苏省财经学校的学生，不久之前才被分配到中央第一机械工业部华北建筑工程公司工作的。我就谈谈我们学校的一些情形吧！
    今年四月的最后十天，我们举行了毕业考试。毕业考试的成绩是这样的：在三百八十七个毕业同学中，总平均在九十分以上的占百分之三十八点六；八十五分以上的占百分之五十六点七；其余同学的成绩都在七十五分以上。在这些同学中，有六十七个同学三年来总平均的学习成绩达到了九十五分以上。
    我们为什么能得到这样漂亮的分数呢？
    刘光培同学在自己“工业簿记核算”讲义的第一页上写着：“如果你爱你的祖国，那你就一定要把它学好！”原来这位同学，在过去一段很长时间是不喜欢这门功课的，听讲兴趣不大，成绩考得不好。离毕业的时间越近，他心中越觉得难过。他想：“马上我就要参加到祖国经济建设的行列中了，这样继续下去，怎能担当起这伟大的任务呢？假若我已经是一个发电厂的配电员，在工作的时候思想不集中，比如说，忘记拨动了电门，该有多少人会陷于黑暗世界，该有多少工厂要停止生产……，”他不敢再继续往下想了。“思想不集中对祖国是一个多么不能容忍的犯罪行为啊！就这样，他改变了对“工业簿记核算”不感兴趣的错误态度，取得了优良的学习成绩。
    “祖国”这个字眼，对于我们已经不是抽象的名词，而是有着丰富的、沸腾的生活内容。它是多么亲切，多么吸引着人们的心弦啊！不论是一个工业生产新纪录的出现，一个农业生产合作社的诞生和成长，都能引起我们对它的深厚感情，都直接地鼓舞着我们不断前进。
    记得一个星期天，我和拨款监督科的一个同学闲聊，他忽然对我说：“只要我打开报纸一看，不是这里出现了油田，就是那里发现了铁矿，基本建设到处在进行着。我每次看过了报纸，总觉得有一种说不出来的感情，就好像祖国在催促着我，不，在命令着我赶快学，赶快学！”“你说，”他停了一下，“德诚，你们企业会计科不是也学习过‘基本建设’的学科吗？你看，进行基本建设，没有拨款监督专业这方面的人材行吗？那么，我怎能不热爱这门学科，怎能不赶快学呢？”
    有一次，王振玉编一张商品销售计划表，最后的数字怎么也投不起来，一小时、两小时……过去了，别的同学都完成了这个作业，去休息了。这时，他想：“跟人家的对一对不很快就解决了吗？”可是，这个念头刚刚产生，马上就打消了，他想起了卓娅做代数题时拒绝舒拉的帮助，坚持了一个晚上的情景，他又想起了不久前在斯大林同志的遗像前庄严的誓言：“要学习苏联青年的坚强意志和克服困难的精神，来对待自己的学习。”“马上我就要为祖国工作了，那时要是数字投不起来，跟谁去对呢？”他自言自语地这样说。接着，他好像命令自己似地：“我是一个光荣的青年团员，不应该依赖别人，更不应该窃盗别人的劳动成果……”。后来，计划表终于完满地编出来了，他笑着告诉我：“只有经过了劳动，才会感觉到愉快！”
    我们所以这样爱自己的祖国，就是因为我们爱自己的生活，我们的学校生活的确够愉快够幸福了。我们有头等的苏联教材，有完整的教学计划和教学大纲，有诲人不倦的老师，有互助友爱的同学，更有帮助我们提高政治觉悟、引导我们前进的党团组织。早晨，我们在宽阔的操场上，伴着优美的音乐做广播体操，锻炼身体；白天，就投入紧张的学习，提高自己；遇到假期节日，生活就过得更加愉快。有的在瘦西湖上泛舟，有的在五亭桥、平山堂远眺，引吭高歌，纵情欢笑！大家陶醉于美好的现在，憧憬着更幸福的未来。美好的生活在同学中逐渐陶冶出一种新的道德，大家爱祖国，也就爱祖国培养着的人材——自己的同学。胡友兰上学期患了重病，大半学期没有上学。功课赶不上，她就有些灰心。大家都跑去安慰和鼓励她。团的组织还专门开了会，研究如何对她进行具体帮助。由于要求帮助她温习功课的人太多，组织上就指定班上成绩最好、平常比较和她接近的两个同学担负了这个任务。虽然这样决定了，别的同学还经常去问她：“有问题吗？提出来大家研究研究！”常常为了一个小问题，同学们不惜用一个钟头、两个钟头的时间讲给她听，直到她彻底理解为止。就这样，胡友兰的功课很快就赶上了。同学们这样的关心和帮助，使她又感动，又不安。大家告诉她：“一个同学学习不好，就是国家培养我们的损失，我们帮助你，也就等于给国家贡献一分力量。因为祖国在等待着你哩！”
    亲爱的同志们，让我再告诉你们，我们是在如何服从祖国的统一分配的情形吧！
    一个正在争取入团的年青姑娘刘莲珍，在自己的决心书上写着：“坚决服从祖国的统一分配，愉快地自觉地走上祖国最需要的岗位。不管是城市或乡村，沙漠或平原，山岳或海滨，工厂、矿山、公司、合作社……，祖国和人民的需要就是我的理想，就是我个人的志愿！”
    这张决心书的产生是不容易的。刘莲珍从小就处在娇生惯养的环境中，她的母亲对她尤其疼爱和娇纵。在这次统一分配工作之前，她母亲对她的工作分配提出了两个条件：一是不要离开家乡—扬州，二是到工厂里去工作。这样一方面母女可以常常见面，另一方面女儿也不会吃苦。
    刘莲珍开始的确有些动摇，思想发生斗争了。可是她想：“谁没有母亲的爱，谁的家庭不温暖呢？”
    “那么，黄继光为什么要用自己的身体堵塞住敌人的机枪口？为什么邱少云能在烈火下坚持二十多分钟，直到牺牲了自己宝贵的生命？赵一曼、刘胡兰……又为什么会那样英勇不屈、慷慨就义呢？难道她们家庭不够温暖，母亲不爱他们吗？”
    “不，不是的！”她十分肯定地得出结论。他们的家庭一样温暖，母亲对他们一样疼爱。但是，他们的敌人——我们祖国的敌人，不允许他们狭隘地接受自己的母爱，接受家庭的温暖。所以他们才抛弃了自己的一切，牺牲了自己的生命，让所有的儿女永远沐浴在母亲的爱和家庭的温暖中！”问题得到了正确的答案，她不由得愉快地笑了起来。最后，她毅然做了决定：“我要用妈妈对我的爱，来爱我的祖国。服从祖国的统一分配，就是我爱妈妈的具体行动！”接着，她又把你们在朝鲜的英雄故事，国家未来建设的美景以及服从祖国统一分配的道理讲给母亲听。天数长了，母亲的思想也开朗了，自动放弃了她原来的两个条件，开始愉快地给女儿整理行装，准备欢送女儿奔赴祖国需要她的建设岗位去！
    有一次，我和陆祖杰同学开玩笑说：“你希望不希望和你的爱人黄淑敏在一起工作？”“这还用问，”他回答，“爱人嘛，谁还不希望在一起？”我又逗他：“你不是在小组会上向大家表示过，不需要组织上照顾你的爱人问题吗？”“不需要并不等于不希望！”他突然变得严肃了起来，好像在给我进行教育似地继续说：“这就是说……一句话，不能把对爱人的爱驾于对祖国的爱之上。再说，我还是个青年团员，青年团员更应该有这种觉悟，应该起带头作用呀！”他停了一停，笑着又说了下去：“我们年龄都还小，假若一两年后，彼此在工作上都有了成就，对祖国都有了一些贡献，那时再见面，该是多么甜蜜，多么愉快啊！”
    就这样，祖国的统一分配工作在我们学校顺利地完成了。离校前夕，当大家在学校的临时礼堂琼花观告别的时候，立下了共同的誓言：“今天在琼花观离别，明天到天安门相见！”
    同志们，我们衷心地希望，当我们在天安门相见的时候，也能看到你们，那时再来畅叙一切。让我们在保卫祖国和建设祖国的岗位上并肩携手勉力前进吧！
