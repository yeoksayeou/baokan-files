Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 7th. Korean orphans fostered in Shancheng Town, Hailong County, Liaodong Province, China, recently wrote to Marshal Kim Il-sung reporting on their happy lives. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Respected Marshal Kim Il-sung:

Under the care of you and Chairman Mao Zedong, we came to Shancheng Town, Hailong County, Liaodong Province, Northeast China. With the warm love and care of Chinese mothers, we have fully recovered our health. Everyone's weight is constantly increasing. The average weight increase is eight kilograms per person, and the most significant increase is for Kim Hwan-ho, who has grown fair and chubby, with a total increase of seventeen kilograms.

Chinese mothers and uncles have tried every means to ensure our health and happiness. The Chinese uncles of the County Cooperative Union, in their spare time, voluntarily participate in labor, and all the 1.7 million yuan of labor remuneration they earn is used to buy us the most nutritious food and toys. Chinese mother Xu Yuxiu sent many flower seedlings to decorate our academy like a beautiful garden. Now, every evening, we happily dance and sing with Chinese children in this garden. Sometimes, we also listen to combat stories from the comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the convalescing members of the returning Chinese People's Volunteers. Chinese mothers and uncles often write to comfort us. They express in their letters that the Chinese people will work hard for a peaceful resolution of our motherland's problems and will help with our motherland's reconstruction.

Recently, thirty-three students from our academy, at the invitation of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, participated in the Shenyang Young Pioneers summer camp, living with Chinese children all day long, jumping, singing, visiting, and picnicking, just like in our motherland before the war against the American invaders. In these peaceful and happy days, we are even more concerned about our brothers and sisters in our motherland. How happy we were when the armistice agreement was signed on July 27th! Because we finally achieved victory.

We are grateful to you and the uncles of the People's Army, and we thank Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Recently, we selected thirty-three children to represent all the students of our academy to sweep the tombs of the three martyrs Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, and Sun Zhanyuan, heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers who sacrificed their lives to defend our motherland, at the Northeast Martyrs Cemetery. Their great spirit has a great inspirational power for us.

We are all working hard in our studies, so as not to fail your and our motherland's expectations and the care of the Chinese people. We have the ideal of rebuilding our motherland, and we also have a healthy body. We always remember your teaching: "Learning is fighting!" Therefore, we have made rapid progress in our studies. In the first semester, the average score of our entire academy was 3.2, in the second semester it increased to 3.9, and in the third semester it even reached 4.4. The vast majority of students in the academy received a full score of 5 in all subjects. We use these achievements to repay your and the motherland's people's care and the Chinese people's love! Finally, we wish:

Our respected leader Marshal Kim Il-sung a long life!

Respectfully,
The Entire Student Body of the Korean Orphan Elementary School, Shancheng Town, Hailong County, Liaodong Province

    住在我国辽东省海龙县的朝鲜孤儿
    写信给金日成元帅报告他们的幸福生活
    【新华社沈阳七日电】在我国辽东省海龙县山城镇抚养的朝鲜孤儿，最近写信给金日成元帅报告他们的幸福生活。信的全文如下：敬爱的金日成元帅：
    我们在您和毛泽东主席的关怀下来到了中国东北辽东省海龙县山城镇，在中国妈妈们的热心抚爱与照顾下，我们已经完全恢复了健康，每个人的体重都在不断增加，平均每人体重已增加了八公斤，其中增加最多的金宦浩，长的又白又胖，共增加了十七公斤。
    为了我们身体健康和生活愉快，中国妈妈和伯伯们想尽了各种办法。我们所住在的县合作社联合社的中国伯伯们，在业余时间自愿参加劳动，把所得的一百七十万元劳动报酬全部用来给我们买最富有营养的食品和玩具。中国妈妈徐玉秀送来很多花苗，把我们学院装饰成好像一个美丽的花园。现在，我们每天傍晚，就在这座花园里和中国小朋友愉快地跳舞、歌唱。有的时候，我们还和中国人民解放军与回国的中国人民志愿军的休养员同志在一起，听他们讲战斗故事。中国妈妈和叔叔们，经常写信来慰问我们。他们来信，表示中国人民要为和平解决我们祖国的问题而努力，并要帮助我们祖国的复兴。
    最近，我们学院有三十三名同学，应中国新民主主义青年团沈阳市委员会的邀请，参加了沈阳少年先锋队夏令营，整天和中国小朋友生活在一起，跳啊！唱啊！参观啊！野游啊！就好像在我们反对美国侵略者的战争前的祖国里一样。我们在和平幸福的日子里，更加关怀祖国的兄弟姊妹们。当七月二十七日签订停战协定的时候，我们是多么高兴呀！因为我们终于取得了胜利。
    我们感激您和人民军叔叔们，我们感谢毛泽东主席和中国人民志愿军。最近，我们选派了三十三个小朋友，代表我们学院全体同学，去东北烈士陵园，为保卫我们祖国而牺牲的中国人民志愿军英雄黄继光、邱少云、孙占元三烈士陵前扫墓，他们的伟大精神对我们有巨大的感召力量。
    我们在学习上都很用心，以不辜负您和祖国的期望和中国人民的关怀。我们有着重建祖国的理想，也有着健康的身体，我们更时刻地记着您的教导：“学习就是战斗！”因此我们在学习上获得了飞速的进步。在第一学期我们全学院学习成绩平均为三点二分，第二学期就提高到三点九分，到第三学期更达到四点四分。各科全获五分的同学占全学院学生的绝大多数。我们以这些成就来报答您和祖国人民的关怀和中国人民的抚爱！最后敬祝：
    我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅万寿无疆！
              辽东省海龙县山城镇朝鲜孤儿初等学院全体同学敬上
