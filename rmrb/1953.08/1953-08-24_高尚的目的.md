A lofty purpose of our Party and the People's Government in assisting ethnic minorities to develop their political, economic, and cultural policies is to gradually improve the productivity of ethnic minorities and appropriately meet their material and cultural needs. For this lofty purpose, the former Southwest Military and Political Committee's Finance and Economic Committee studied the issue of how to develop the economy of ethnic minority areas and improve the lives of ethnic minorities at the economic work conference in ethnic minority areas at the end of last year. The meeting believed that the key to gradually developing agricultural production in agricultural areas inhabited by ethnic minorities is to first replace backward production tools with new production tools, so that productivity can be rapidly improved. However, due to years of oppression and exploitation by reactionary rulers, ethnic minorities are extremely impoverished and cannot complete the reform of production tools with their own economic strength in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, the meeting decided, and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government approved, to mainly use the economic strength of the state to assist by issuing a large number of free agricultural tools (more than 40 billion yuan will be issued this year), requiring that within two or three years, the ethnic minority people engaged in agricultural production in agricultural areas can basically use the agricultural tools used by farmers in Han areas. At present, the agricultural tools used in ethnic minority areas in the Southwest are still quite primitive and backward. According to investigations, the Yi Autonomous Region and Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang, the Mengzi, Simao, and Lijiang Special Zones of Yunnan, and the ethnic minority people in many mountainous areas of Guizhou still use wooden agricultural tools, and only a few areas have five or six households sharing one hoe. Because of the extreme backwardness and lack of production tools, the agricultural production of ethnic minorities in these areas has always been in a fairly primitive state of "slash-and-burn" cultivation, early planting and late harvesting, and extensive planting with low yields. This situation shows that the Party and the government's decision to start social and economic transformation by reforming production tools is completely in line with the urgent needs of ethnic minorities. In the development of social economy, the improvement of production tools plays a decisive role. Therefore, grasping this decisive issue and striving to meet the lofty purpose of meeting the urgent needs of ethnic minorities is undoubtedly the responsibility of newspapers mainly aimed at ethnic minority farmers.

The New Guizhou Daily and the Xikang Daily have generally fulfilled this responsibility. Taking the New Guizhou Daily as an example, in addition to the shortcomings of not publishing comments on such major reforms and lacking due criticism of some phenomena that ignored the distribution of agricultural tools, the newspaper made certain efforts in the following aspects. First, the New Guizhou Daily made continuous publicity reports for more than three months from the beginning of the first batch of free agricultural tools distribution in the province in April to the basic completion of the distribution work at the end of July. The newspaper reported on the distribution of free agricultural tools from beginning to end, from one township, one county, one special zone to the entire province. For example, the newspaper's report on June 26 on the distribution of more than 35,000 free agricultural tools in the Bijie Special Zone, and the report on July 24 on the basic completion of the first batch of free agricultural tools distribution in Guizhou Province, both systematically reflected the overall progress of this work. The latter report showed that the first batch of free agricultural tools distributed throughout the province was worth 5 billion yuan, and approximately 255,000 free agricultural tools had been distributed in 72 counties where ethnic minorities lived in concentrated or scattered communities, accounting for three-quarters of the total number of free agricultural tools distributed throughout the province. More than 150,000 poor households of ethnic minorities received these free agricultural tools. Each household generally received two or three agricultural tools, with the least being one, and some households received a complete set of agricultural tools such as plows, hoes, harrows, and sickles, totaling as many as seven pieces. On the other hand, the New Guizhou Daily also conducted continuous reports on the principles and methods of distribution work, as well as organizational leadership, based on the process of distribution work. For example, the reports on the distribution of free agricultural tools in Weining Seventh District, Nayonghe Township in Nayong County, and Bijie Special Zone on June 16 and 26 all implemented the principle of "only distributing agricultural tools, not distributing cash," and focusing on areas with "ethnic minority concentration, poor natural conditions, and backward production methods," and the method of conducting investigation and research among the masses, fully discussing and evaluating the distribution. In terms of organizational leadership, it continuously praised Anlong, Xingyi, Lushan, Kaiyang, Guanling, Tianzhu and other counties' state-owned trade and cooperatives for actively organizing blacksmiths to process and rush to produce a large number of agricultural tools. This played a certain role in promoting the distribution of agricultural tools in various places.

Second, in coordination with the distribution of agricultural tools and the issuance of loans for draught cattle, the New Guizhou Daily also paid appropriate attention to the publicity and education of farming techniques to farmers. For example, the report "Miao People in High Mountains Have Learned to Do Field Work" on June 19 reflected the local Party, government, and Han and Buyi farmers actively helping the Miao people who have lived in high mountains for a long time to learn to plow fields and harrow, demonstrating a new atmosphere of unity and production among all ethnic groups. Gang Zhilin, the deputy township head, and Luo Zhiwen, a township cadre, personally went to the Damao Village, went deep into the fields, and patiently explained the methods of plowing and harrowing to the Miao peasant brothers. Zhang Huaguang and Wei Zhian, Han farmers from the Second Village, and Wang Zhihua, a Buyi farmer, taught Li Shunqing and Yang Shunqing, Miao farmers, how to plow and harrow, which had a great effect. According to the report, after the patient help from all parties, many Miao farmers have learned to plow and harrow and can do field work. The report "From Cattle Drinking Wine to Fully 'Armed'" on July 16 vividly described how the Dong and Miao farmers in Liping County changed from pulling plows by people to plowing fields with cattle. Originally, the Dong and Miao farmers had many concerns about changing to plowing with cattle, "fearing being called lazy, fearing piercing the cattle's noses, fearing the cattle would be exhausted to death..." Therefore, when people were digging the fields heavily, many cattle were grazing on the hills in groups. But to change this habit, we must follow the mass line. This report wrote that a Communist Youth League member pierced the nose of the cattle without telling his mother, scaring his mother to give the cattle wine to "strengthen its courage" and "relieve its pain," resulting in the cattle getting drunk. The report used this example to illustrate that we must follow the mass line and adopt the method of holding cattle household symposiums to drive the general. After this method was adopted by the farmers in Diping and Huamin townships, they had "pierced the noses of the cattle, put on girths and backbands..." letting them be fully "armed" to plow and harrow. Now people are relaxed. The mode of labor has changed dramatically. These examples show that with the distribution of iron agricultural tools and draught cattle loans, we must also teach ethnic minority farmers farming techniques in order to truly achieve the purpose of distributing iron agricultural tools and increase the confidence of ethnic minority farmers in using iron agricultural tools. The New Guizhou Daily's ability to pay appropriate attention to the publicity and education of farming techniques undoubtedly helps the reform of production tools.

Finally, and most importantly, through the distribution of free agricultural tools, the New Guizhou Daily also paid attention to publicizing the major changes and influences that have begun to occur in the political and economic life of the reform of production tools. In the political life, the newspaper reflected in many reports the care of the Party and the government, as well as the gratitude of ethnic minority people to the Party and Chairman Mao and the rise of friendship among all ethnic groups. For example, the newsletter "A Step Forward in Production Methods" in the newspaper on May 9 reflected on the one hand how the Libo County People's Government supported the Yao farmers in Yaoshan to improve production tools and production techniques from all aspects, and on the other hand reflected that after changing the "slash-and-burn" cultivation method, a new atmosphere had appeared in the Jiagu Valley of Yaoshan. Yao farmers constantly raised such a song of gratitude on the slopes and in the Jiagu Valley every day:
    The suffering of the Yao family is like an abyss,
    Living in caves without seeing the sun.
    The landlords locked up our feet,
    Chairman Mao unlocks the lock!
    The landlords drove the Yao family up the mountain,
    Chairman Mao brought the Yao family down;
    The landlords locked up our feet,
    Chairman Mao unlocks the lock again!

With the liberation of productive forces, the political enthusiasm of all ethnic groups has been enhanced, and the unity and friendship among all ethnic groups have been strengthened. For example, the reports in the newspaper on June 6 and 16 stated that many ethnic minority farmers in Congjiang, Shibing, Jianhe, Ziyun, Nayong and many other counties expressed their willingness to repay the care of the Party and the government with practical actions of patriotic production increase after receiving free agricultural tools. The report "The Sun Shines on the Miao Farmers of Sizhai Township" on July 1 described the enthusiasm of the Miao farmers for unity and mutual assistance and launching patriotic production increase competitions. The report said that the cool south wind constantly sent such a loud song in the fields:
    The sun shines on Sizhai Township,
    The fields and dams are bright;
    You build fields and I plant seedlings,
    Apply more fertilizer and produce more grain.

This patriotic production increase enthusiasm aroused by the reform of production tools and production techniques will undoubtedly gradually cause changes in production relations. However, under the current conditions, the most direct and significant changes in the reform of production tools and production techniques are still the liberation and improvement of productive forces. Although the New Guizhou Daily has reported very little on this aspect, it also showed this change in some reports. This is to raise the level of agricultural productivity of more than 150,000 poor ethnic minority farmers from the fairly primitive stage of wooden agricultural tools to the stage of iron agricultural tools. This is not a small progress, but marks a progress of several centuries. They changed the production method of "slash-and-burn" cultivation using their feet to step on the fields, and used iron agricultural tools and cattle to plow and harrow; both reducing labor fatigue and increasing labor productivity, and expanding the cultivated area. The report "More Than 150,000 Ethnic Minority Households Receive Agricultural Tools" in the newspaper on July 24 showed this progress after the reform of production tools. The report said that Yang Haiyun, a farmer in the Eighth District of Pan County, finished planting three sheng of corn land, which used to take four days to complete, in only two days after receiving a plow and a hoe. Miao and Yi farmers in Guowa Township, Dading County, also reclaimed and planted corn and other crops on three dou of land that had been abandoned for more than five years. Farmers in the Gaopo Miao Autonomous Region of Guizhu County built 29 ditches, which can irrigate more than 15,000 dan of fields. With the increase in productivity and the expansion of cultivated area, there will be an increase in grain production and a gradual improvement in life. Regarding the changes in this aspect, some significant results will be seen after the autumn of this year. Therefore, the New Guizhou Daily and other border newspapers in the Southwest should not interrupt the reports on the reform of production tools with the end of the distribution of free agricultural tools; it should conduct typical investigations in a mountainous area and a township, and organize profound and moving reports. Through these reports, systematically explain from the essence and effect of the reform of production tools that the lofty purpose of our Party and the People's Government in helping ethnic minorities develop their political, economic, and cultural policies is to gradually improve the productivity of ethnic minority people and appropriately meet their material and cultural needs. This is not only the responsibility of newspapers mainly aimed at ethnic minority farmers, but also the responsibility of newspapers mainly aimed at ethnic minority herdsmen. Because, in the ethnic minority areas of our country, on the one hand, there are vast areas that are agricultural areas, and on the other hand, in pastoral areas such as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, attention should also be paid to improving livestock breeds, improving pastures, improving animal husbandry methods, supplying tools for shearing, milking, and mowing, and promoting livestock epidemic prevention and other work, in order to gradually develop animal husbandry and achieve the goal of "prosperity for both people and livestock."

### 高尚的目的

专栏：报纸工作述评

    高尚的目的
    逐步提高少数民族人民的生产力，并适当满足其物质文化生活的需要，就是我们党和人民政府帮助少数民族发展其政治、经济、文化政策底高尚目的。为了这个高尚的目的，原西南军政委员会财政经济委员会曾在去年底少数民族地区经济工作会议上，研究了如何发展少数民族地区经济、改善少数民族生活的问题。会议认为在少数民族居住的农业地区逐步发展农业生产的关键，首先是用新的生产工具代替落后的生产工具，使生产力迅速提高一大步。但少数民族由于历年遭受反动统治者的压迫和剥削，生活极端贫困，不可能用自己的经济力量在较短时期内完成生产工具的改革。因而会议决定并经中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会批准，主要用国家的经济力量来协助，由人民政府大量发放无偿农具（今年先发放四百多亿元），要求在两三年内基本上使在农业地区从事农业生产的少数民族人民能使用汉族地区农民曾使用的农具。现时西南少数民族地区所使用的农具，还相当原始和落后。据调查，西康的彝族自治区、藏族自治区，云南的蒙自、思茅、丽江等专区和贵州很多大山区的少数民族人民，仍然使用着木制农具，只有少数地区五、六户农民才能合用一把锄头。因为生产工具极端落后和缺乏，这些地区的少数民族的农业生产一直是处在“刀耕火种”、早种晚收、广种薄收的相当原始的情况下。这种情况说明，党和政府首先从改革生产工具着手进行社会经济改造的决定，是完全符合少数民族人民的迫切需要的。在社会经济的发展中，生产工具的改进是具有决定作用的，因而，抓着这一具有决定作用的问题，为满足少数民族人民的迫切需要这一高尚目的而斗争，无疑地也是以少数民族农民为主要对象的报纸的责任。
    新黔日报和西康日报，一般地说是尽到这个责任的。以新黔日报为例，除对于这样重大的改革没有发表过评论，和对于一些忽视发放农具工作的现象缺乏应有的批评等等缺点外，该报曾在以下几方面作了一定的努力。首先，新黔日报从该省四月间开始发放第一批无偿农具到七月底发放工作基本结束，三个多月来曾作了连续的宣传报道。该报自始至终地报道了发放无偿农具的情况，从一个乡、一个县、一个专区直到全省。如该报六月二十六日对毕节专区已发放无偿农具三万五千多件的报道，七月二十四日对贵州全省第一批无偿农具发放工作基本结束的报道，都比较系统地反映了这一工作的全面进展。在后一报道中就表明，全省第一批发放的无偿农具价值五十亿元，已在各少数民族人民聚居或散居的七十二个县发出的无偿农具约计有二十五万五千件，占全省无偿农具发放总数的四分之三，得到这种无偿农具的少数民族农民共达十五万多贫苦户。每户得到农具的情形，一般的是两三件，最少的是一件，有的户则得到犁、锄、耙、镰刀等全套农具达七件之多。另一方面，新黔日报还根据发放工作的过程，从发放工作的方针、方法，以及组织领导方面进行了连续的报道。如六月十六日、二十六日对于威宁七区、纳雍县纳雍河乡和毕节专区发放无偿农具的报道中，都贯彻了“只发农具，不发现款”、以“少数民族聚居、自然条件坏、生产方式落后”的地区作重点的方针，和向群众进行调查研究、充分商量、评议发放的方法。在组织领导方面，则连续地表扬了安龙、兴义、炉山、开阳、关岭、天柱等县国营贸易、合作社积极组织铁匠加工、赶制大量农具。这就对各地发放农具工作起了一定推进作用。
    第二、配合发放农具、发放耕牛贷款工作，新黔日报还适当注意了对农民进行耕作技术的宣传教育。例如六月十九日“高山苗家学会了做田头活路”的报道，就反映了当地党、政府和汉族、布依族农民积极帮助久居高山的苗族农民学犁田，打耙，表现了各族农民团结生产的新气象。副乡长刚志林、乡干部罗志文亲自到大苗寨，深入田间，耐心地向苗家农民兄弟讲解犁田打耙的方法，二村汉族农民张华光、魏治安和布依族农民王志华教苗家农民李顺清、杨顺清犁田打耙的方法，都收到很大效果。据报道中说，经过各方面的耐心帮助，很多苗家农民已经学会犁田打耙，会做田头活路了，在七月十六日“从牛喝酒到全副‘武装’”的报道中，更生动地描述了黎平县侗、苗族农民怎样由人拉犁改用牛犁田的情景。原来侗、苗族农民对于改用牛犁田抱有很多顾虑，“怕说是懒汉，怕牛穿鼻子，怕牛累死。……”因而，当人们沉重地挖田时，很多水牛却成群地在山坡上啃草。但要改变这种习惯，必须走群众路线。这篇报道写一个青年团员瞒着他妈把牛穿了鼻子，吓得他妈给牛灌酒“壮胆”“去疼”，结果把牛醉倒，报道以这一事例说明必须走群众路线，必须采用召开牛户座谈会带动一般的方法。这个方法被地坪、化民两乡的农民采用后，已“把牛穿了鼻子，上了肚带、背带，……”让它全副“武装”起来，去犁田打耙。现在人们都轻快起来。劳动方式骤然变了。这些事例表明，随着铁质农具和耕牛贷款的发放，对于少数民族农民还必须跟着教会耕作技术，才能真正达到发放铁质农具的目的，并提高少数民族农民使用铁质农具的信心。新黔日报能够适当注意耕作技术的宣传教育，无疑是有助于生产工具的改革的。
    最后，也是最重要的，新黔日报通过无偿农具的发放工作，还注意宣传了生产工具改革在政治、经济生活方面所开始发生的重大变化和影响。在政治生活方面，该报在很多报道中反映了党、政府的关怀，以及少数民族人民对党对毛主席的感戴和各民族友谊的高涨。如该报在五月九日“生产方法向前跨进了一步”的通讯中，就一方面反映了荔波县人民政府如何从各方面扶持瑶山瑶族农民改进生产工具和生产技术，一方面反映了改变“刀耕火种”的耕作方法后，瑶山的夹谷里已出现了一片新气象。瑶族农民每天在山坡上、夹谷里，不时扬起这样一支感激的歌声：
    瑶家苦头如深渊，
    不见天日住洞穴。
    地主把我们的脚儿锁起来，
    毛主席把锁来开！
    地主把瑶家赶上山，
    毛主席把瑶家接下来；
    地主把我们的脚儿锁起来，
    毛主席又把锁来开！随着生产力的解放，各族人民的政治积极性提高了，各族人民的团结友爱增强了。如该报六月六日、十六日的报道中，就有从江、施秉、剑河、紫云、纳雍等许多县的少数民族农民在得到无偿农具后，纷纷表示要用爱国增产的实际行动来报答党和政府对他们的关怀。在七月一日“太阳照着四寨乡的苗族农民”的报道中，更描述了苗族农民团结互助和开展爱国增产竞赛的热情。报道中说，凉爽的南风，在田野上不断送来这样嘹亮的歌声：
    太阳照在四寨乡，
    满田满坝亮堂堂；
    你造田来我栽秧，
    多施肥料多打粮。这种由于生产工具和生产技术的改革所激发起的爱国增产积极性，无疑地会逐渐引起生产关系的变化。但在目前条件下，生产工具和生产技术改革最直接最显著的变化，首先还是生产力的解放和提高。新黔日报对于这一方面虽然报道得还很少，但在某些报道中也显示了这种变化。这就是把十五万多户贫苦少数民族农民的农业生产力的水平，由相当原始的木制农具阶段提高到铁质农具阶段。这不是一个微小的进步，而是标志着前进了几个世纪。他们改变了“刀耕火种”用脚踩田的生产方式，而使用铁质农具和牛犁田打耙；既减少了劳动疲劳、提高了劳动生产率，又扩大了耕地面积。该报在七月二十四日“十五万多户少数民族得到农具”的报道中，就曾显示了生产工具改革后的这种进步。报道中说，盘县八区农民杨海云领到犁和锄头后，把过去要四天才能栽完的三升包谷地，只用两天就栽完了。大定县果瓦乡的苗、彝族农民，把荒了五年以上的三斗地，也开垦种上包谷等作物。贵筑县高坡苗族自治区农民，则修了二十九条水沟，可以灌溉一万五千多挑田。随着生产力的提高和耕地面积的扩大而来的，就是粮食的增产和生活的逐渐改善。关于这方面的变化，在今年秋后当会看到一些显著的效果。因而，新黔日报以及西南其他边疆地区的报纸，是不应随着无偿农具发放工作的结束而中断了生产工具改革的报道；它更应该深入一个山区、一个乡进行典型调查，组织深刻而感人的报道。通过这些报道，从生产工具改革的实质和效果上，来系统地阐述我们党和人民政府帮助少数民族发展其政治、经济、文化政策底高尚目的，是在于逐步提高少数民族人民的生产力，并适当满足其物质文化生活的需要。这不仅是以少数民族农民为主要对象的报纸，而且也是以少数民族牧民为主要对象的报纸的责任。因为，在我国少数民族地区内，一方面有广大地区是农业区，一方面在内蒙古自治区及绥远、青海、新疆等地牧业区，也需要注意改良畜种、改良牧草、改良畜养方法、供应剪毛、挤奶、割草的工具，以及推广牲畜防疫等工作，才能逐步发展畜牧业、达到“人畜两旺”的目的。
