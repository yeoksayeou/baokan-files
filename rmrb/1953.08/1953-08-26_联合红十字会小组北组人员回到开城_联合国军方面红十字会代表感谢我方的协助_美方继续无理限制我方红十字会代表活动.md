    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 25th: The 54 representatives of the Joint Red Cross Team North Group's Biktong and Manpo subgroups have returned to Kaesong by train at 11:00 AM this morning, after successfully completing their work visiting prisoner-of-war camps in North Korea. At 3:30 PM that afternoon, 27 Red Cross representatives from the UN forces returned to their side of the area via Panmunjom.

    After all the representatives arrived in Kaesong, they immediately attended a luncheon hosted by the Chinese and Korean side members of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee. All the Chinese and Korean side representatives of the Joint Red Cross Team Coordination Group were also invited to attend the banquet.

    At the banquet, Colonel Li Ping-il, the chief member of the Chinese and Korean side of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee, gave a speech congratulating the representatives on the successful completion of their work visiting the prisoner-of-war camps. Zhang Yi, chairman of the Joint Red Cross Team North Group, gave a speech thanking the Chinese and Korean military authorities for the convenience and assistance provided to their work. Zhu Luo-mu, chief representative of the UN forces side of the Joint Red Cross Team North Group, said: "The military authorities have made meticulous arrangements for this work, and I express my gratitude for this."

    During the banquet, the representatives of the Joint Red Cross Team exchanged impressions of the visit with the representatives of the Chinese and Korean military authorities. Jakobsen, a 55-year-old Danish doctor, said: "This was a very pleasant trip."

    After the banquet, the chief representatives of both sides of the Joint Red Cross Team North Group met with the representatives of both sides of the Kaesong subgroup, who will continue to work in Kaesong, and listened to their work reports. Then, 27 Red Cross representatives from the UN forces departed and returned to their side of the area via Panmunjom.

    On the same day that the Joint Red Cross Team North Group returned to Kaesong after successfully completing their work visiting prisoner-of-war camps, three mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Teams departed for South Korea to investigate the US side's unreasonable restrictions and obstruction of visits by Chinese and Korean Red Cross representatives, which serves as a clear contrast.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 24th: The US side continues to unreasonably restrict and obstruct the activities of the Chinese and Korean Red Cross representatives visiting US prisoner-of-war camps. According to reports received here, the Chinese and Korean Red Cross representatives of the Joint Red Cross Team's Koje-do subgroup requested to observe the scene where the US military used poison gas bombs at the Koje-do prisoner-of-war camp on August 9th and to express condolences to the captured personnel who suffered, but the US prisoner-of-war camp authorities simply did not respond. The Chinese and Korean Red Cross representatives of the Koje-do subgroup have also made every effort to request visits and condolences to the captured personnel, to distribute gifts and condolence letters to the captured personnel, and to observe the living conditions of the captured personnel, in accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement and the working agreement of the Joint Red Cross Team, but Colonel Lee Que-xun, commander of the US Koje-do No. 1 prisoner-of-war camp, simply ignored these reasonable requests. According to North Korean People's Army prisoners of war who returned on the 24th, they had not seen the Chinese and Korean Red Cross representatives when they left Koje-do on the 21st.

    At the Imjin River Bridge, the US military twice threw poison gas bombs at prisoners of war in front of the Chinese and Korean Red Cross representatives on the 14th. The Chinese and Korean Red Cross representatives clearly heard the explosion of the poison gas bombs, saw yellow smoke covering the prisoner-of-war camp, and saw about a dozen prisoners of war being carried away from a distance. The Chinese and Korean Red Cross representatives immediately protested to the US military authorities and requested to inspect the scene, but were again refused by the US military authorities. The Imjin River Bridge is a transfer station for the US side to repatriate prisoners of war. In the past, the US military authorities allowed the Chinese and Korean Red Cross representatives to welcome and see off the prisoners of war transferred through this place and to watch them get on and off the vehicles. However, from the 17th, the US military authorities unreasonably prohibited these activities.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 25th: The three mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Teams dispatched by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission departed between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM on the 25th to the three places of the Imjin River Bridge, Yeongdeungpo, and Koje-do in South Korea to investigate the US side's violation of the armistice agreement and the unreasonable restriction and obstruction of the activities of the Chinese and Korean Red Cross representatives.

    At the meeting of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on the 25th, it was decided to dispatch alternate members from the two neutral countries of Poland and Switzerland to depart on the 27th to inspect the work of the various Neutral Nations Inspection Teams at the five designated rear ports in South Korea.

    联合红十字会小组北组人员回到开城
    联合国军方面红十字会代表感谢我方的协助
    美方继续无理限制我方红十字会代表活动
    【新华社开城二十五日电】联合红十字会小组北组碧潼分组，满浦分组代表五十四人，在圆满地结束了访问朝鲜北部的战俘营的工作以后，已于今晨十一时乘火车返抵开城。当天下午三时半，联合国军方面各国红十字会代表二十七人经由板门店返回对方地区。
    全体代表抵达开城以后，随即出席了战俘遣返委员会朝中方面委员主持的午宴。联合红十字会小组协调组朝中方面全体代表也应邀出席了宴会。
    在宴会上，战俘遣返委员会朝中方面首席委员李平一上校致词，庆贺代表们顺利地完成了访问战俘营的工作。联合红十字会小组北组主席张翼致词，感谢朝中军事当局所给予的工作上的便利和协助。联合红十字会小组北组联合国军方面首席代表朱洛姆说：“军事当局对这次工作作了细致的安排，我对此表示感谢。”
    宴会中，联合红十字会小组的代表们和朝中军事当局代表们交谈了这次访问的感想。五十五岁的丹麦老医生杰柯普逊说：“这是一次非常快乐的旅行。”
    宴会以后，联合红十字会小组北组双方首席代表会见了将继续留在开城工作的开城分组的双方代表，并听取了他们的工作报告。然后，联合国军方面各国红十字会代表二十七人出发经由板门店返回对方地区。
    在联合红十字会小组北组圆满完成访问战俘营的工作以后返回开城的同一天，三个机动中立国视察小组出发到南朝鲜去调查美方无理限制和阻挠朝中红十字会代表访问的事件，这恰好成为一个鲜明的对照。
    【新华社开城二十四日电】美方继续无理限制和阻挠朝中红十字会代表访问美方战俘营的活动。据此间所接到的报告，联合红十字会小组巨济岛分组朝中红十字会代表，在八月九日美军向巨济岛战俘营施放毒气弹时，就曾向美方战俘营当局提出要求到施放毒气弹的现场观察，并对受难的被俘人员进行慰问，但美方战俘营管理当局却根本不予答复。巨济岛分组朝中红十字会代表也曾竭力要求根据停战协定和联合红十字会小组工作协议的规定，向被俘人员进行访问和慰问，并向被俘人员分发馈赠品与慰问信，以及观察被俘人员的生活情况，但美方巨济岛第一号战俘营司令官李却逊上校竟对这些合理要求也都不加理睬。据二十四日归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员说，在他们二十一日离开巨济岛的时候，他们还没有见到过朝中红十字会的代表。
    在临津江桥，美军当局十四日两次当着朝中红十字会代表的面向战俘投掷毒气弹。朝中红十字会代表清楚地听到毒气弹的爆炸声，看到黄烟笼罩了战俘营，远远见到约有十多名战俘被背走。朝中红十字会代表当即向美军当局提出抗议，并要求到现场视察，但又被美军当局拒绝。临津江桥本是美方遣送战俘的转运站，美军当局过去曾允许朝中红十字会代表去欢迎和送别经此转运的战俘，观看他们上车下车的情形。但从十七日起，美军当局竟毫无道理地把这一些活动都禁止了。
    【新华社开城二十五日电】中立国监察委员会派遣的三个机动中立国视察小组，已分别在二十五日上午七时至十时之间出发，前往南朝鲜临津江桥、永登浦和巨济岛三个地方，调查美方违反停战协定、无理限制和阻挠朝中红十字会代表活动的事件。
    中立国监察委员会二十五日会议上决定派遣波兰和瑞士两中立国的候补委员，于二十七日出发，前往南朝鲜五个特定后方口岸视察各中立国视察小组的工作。
