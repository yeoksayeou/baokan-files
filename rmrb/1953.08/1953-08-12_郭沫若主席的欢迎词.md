Comrade General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and all returning comrades:

You have returned victoriously from the Korean front, and we, on behalf of all the Chinese people, extend our warm and sincere welcome.

You have executed the will of the Chinese people, leading the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and achieved a great victory in the righteous war of resisting America and aiding Korea for two years and nine months; safeguarding the independence of our neighbor, the security of our motherland, and the peace of Asia and the world. All the people of China thank you, and all peace-loving people around the world thank you.

It was the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army that disrupted the timetable of the U.S. imperialist war of aggression, exposed its outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature, and inspired the world's people with confidence in overcoming war with peace.

Your victory is a victory for the people of the world, a victory for peace, a victory for democracy, and a victory for justice.

The strength of the world's democratic and peaceful camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is growing stronger and stronger. Conversely, the U.S. imperialist policy of aggressive war is increasingly cursed due to the failure of the war of aggression against Korea.

People all over the world are demanding: to resolve all international disputes through negotiation and to ease the international tension created single-handedly by U.S. imperialism.

In the armistice negotiations that were delayed by U.S. imperialism for two years, you provided a typical demonstration of consultation and negotiation, which finally led to the signing of the armistice agreement and the realization of the Korean armistice that the people of the world yearned for. This not only opened up a path for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue but also opened up a path for the peaceful resolution of all international issues.

You are the glory of the Chinese people and the model of the Chinese people. We must learn from you in the long term, and we must popularize and deepen the education of patriotism and internationalism in the long term. We know that the imperialists who were forced to cease fire are not willing to give up. The war merchants of the United States are still manipulating the Syngman Rhee puppet, attempting to sabotage the political conference and resume the war. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance, continue to support the Korean people, and enable the Korean issue to be truly resolved peacefully. We must continue to help the Korean people heal the war wounds caused by imperialist aggression and quickly restore their peaceful and happy lives.

Because the security of the motherland is guaranteed by you, the peaceful construction of the motherland has made rapid progress and has now embarked on the stage of planned construction. We must continue to work hard to ensure the completion of the construction plan, earnestly learn from the Soviet Union, and build China into a peaceful fortress like the Soviet Union, so as to make the democratic and peaceful camp even stronger.

Glory belongs to the highly practical patriots and internationalists!

Glory belongs to the people's heroes who defeated imperialist aggression!

Long live the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

Long live the victory of peace!

    郭沫若主席的欢迎词中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军，各位凯旋的同志：
    你们从朝鲜前线胜利归来了，我们代表全中国人民表示热烈的、诚恳的欢迎。
    你们执行了中国人民的意志，率领着中国人民志愿军，在两年零九个月的抗美援朝的正义战争中，获得了伟大的胜利；保障了邻邦的独立、祖国的安全、亚洲的和平与世界的和平。全中国的人民都感谢你们，全世界爱好和平的人民都感谢你们。
    是中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的英勇作战，打乱了美帝国主义的侵略战争时间表，揭穿了它的外强中干的本质，鼓舞了世界人民和平战胜战争的信心。
    你们的胜利是全世界人民的胜利，是和平的胜利、民主的胜利、正义的胜利。
    以苏联为首的全世界民主和平阵营的力量是越来越壮大了。和这相反，美帝国主义的侵略战争政策，由于侵朝战争的失败，是越来越遭受到诅咒。
    全世界人民都在要求：以协商的办法解决一切的国际争端，把美帝国主义所一手造成的国际紧张局势缓和下来。
    你们在被美帝国主义拖延了两年之久的停战谈判当中，又提供了协商谈判的典型示范，使停战协定终于签订了，使世界人民所渴望的朝鲜停战终于实现了。这不仅为和平解决朝鲜问题开辟出了道路，并为和平解决一切国际问题也开辟出了道路。
    你们是中国人民的光荣，中国人民的模范。我们要长远地向你们学习，要长远地使爱国主义与国际主义的教育普及而深入。我们知道被迫停战的帝国主义者是不肯甘心的。美国的战争贩子们依然在操纵着李承晚傀儡，企图破坏政治会议，恢复战争。我们要保持着高度的警惕，要继续不断地支持朝鲜人民，使朝鲜问题得到真正的和平解决。我们要继续帮助朝鲜人民医治由于帝国主义侵略而带来的战争创伤，迅速恢复其和平幸福的生活。
    由于祖国的安全得到你们的保障，祖国的和平建设有了突飞猛进的成就，目前已经走上计划建设的阶段了。我们要继续不断地努力，保证建设计划的完成，认真地学习苏联，把中国建设成像苏联一样的和平堡垒，使民主和平阵营愈加壮大。
    光荣属于爱国主义与国际主义的高度实践者！
    光荣属于战胜帝国主义侵略的人民英雄！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中朝两国人民永远的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    和平胜利万岁！
