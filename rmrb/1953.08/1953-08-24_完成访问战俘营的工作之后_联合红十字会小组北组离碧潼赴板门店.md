Xinhua News Agency, Biktong, August 23rd: The 28 members of the Joint Red Cross Team North Group, after completing their visits to the POW camps, left Biktong at 7:30 AM on August 23rd for Panmunjom. On their return journey south, they will meet with the other 26 Red Cross personnel from the Manpo group.

At the farewell banquet held by the POW management office of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, Zhang Yi, Chairman of the Joint Red Cross Team North Group, thanked the POW camp authorities for all the cooperation and assistance provided to the group in their work. Roy Jerome spoke on behalf of the personnel from the American, British, Danish, Turkish, Canadian, and South Korean Red Cross societies. He said, "I wholeheartedly agree with the Chairman's remarks. I thank the POW camp authorities, especially for the excellent arrangements they made for us in terms of transportation, accommodation, and food."

During these seventeen days, the members of the Joint Red Cross Team North Group traveled approximately one thousand kilometers and visited various POW camps along the Yalu River. They visited six POW camps holding approximately six thousand Korean and non-Korean POWs, conducting more than twenty visits. In addition to observing the POWs' living conditions and welfare facilities, their accommodation, kitchens, clubs, sports grounds, libraries, and hospitals, talking with the POWs was the most important part of this visit. In the distant POW camps where repatriation work was nearing completion, the POW camp authorities enabled representatives of the POWs there to meet with the Joint Red Cross Team North Group to report on the situation in those POW camps and answer all questions. The Red Cross personnel participated in the POW camps' work of sending off the repatriated POWs and inspected the facilities for transporting the POWs. In addition to visiting several hospitals, doctors from the Joint Red Cross Team North Group held several meetings with the medical staff of the POW camps to discuss the POWs' medical problems in detail. All gifts were distributed to the various POWs, with the help of the POW camp authorities, according to the methods and times suggested by the members of the United Nations forces in the Joint Red Cross Team North Group.

The full cooperation of the POW camp authorities helped the Joint Red Cross Team North Group to complete its mission in such a short period. Cars were available for them all day. There were dedicated round-the-clock communication facilities for their use, and their telegrams were always promptly dispatched without delay. The Red Cross personnel's conversations with the POWs were never restricted in any way, either in terms of time or content. None of the conversations took place under hostile atmosphere watched by armed personnel, as they do in South Korea. The POW camp authorities always granted the requests made by the Red Cross personnel, as long as they were reasonable and possible. Albert Burton of the Canadian Red Cross was therefore able to chat freely with several Canadian POWs in the Third POW Camp, and he was very satisfied with this.

During these seventeen days, the Red Cross personnel from the United States, Britain, Denmark, Turkey, Canada, and South Korea all witnessed firsthand how the consistent lenient policy of the Korean-Chinese People's Armies towards prisoners of war was being implemented.

    完成访问战俘营的工作之后
    联合红十字会小组北组离碧潼赴板门店
    【新华社碧潼二十三日电】联合红十字会小组北组的二十八名人员完成了访问战俘营的工作之后，已在二十三日上午七时三十分离开碧潼去板门店。他们在南返途中，将和满浦分组的另外二十六名红十字会人员会合。
    在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的战俘管理处举行的送别宴会上，联合红十字会小组北组主席张翼感谢战俘营当局给小组在工作上的一切合作和帮助。罗埃·朱洛姆代表美国、英国、丹麦、土耳其、加拿大和南朝鲜红十字会的人员讲话。他说：“我衷心赞同主席的谈话。我感谢战俘营当局，特别是因为他们在我们的交通、居住和食品方面作了出色的安排。”
    联合红十字会小组北组的人员在这十七天中，走了约一千公里的路程，访问了沿鸭绿江的各个战俘营。他们到过容纳约六千名朝鲜籍和非朝鲜籍战俘的六个战俘营，作过二十次以上的访问。除了观察战俘的生活条件和福利设施、他们的住所、厨房、俱乐部、运动场、图书馆和医院以外，和战俘们谈话是这次访问的最重要的部分。在遣返工作已接近完成的距离很远的战俘营，战俘营当局使那里的战俘代表能会晤联合红十字会小组北组，报告那些战俘营的情况，并回答一切问题。红十字会的人员参加了战俘营送走被遣返的战俘的工作，并视察了运送战俘的设备。除了访问几处医院以外，联合红十字会小组北组中的医生和战俘营的医务人员举行过几次会议，详细地讨论了战俘的医疗问题。所有的馈赠品都按照联合红十字会小组北组中联合国军方面组员所建议的方法和时间，在战俘营当局的帮助下，分发给各个战俘。
    战俘营当局的充分合作帮助了联合红十字会小组北组在这么短的期间完成了任务。汽车整天为他们准备着。有专设的日夜不停的通讯设备供他们使用，他们的电报总是毫不迟延地及时拍发出去。红十字会人员和战俘们谈话，不论是在时间或内容方面，都从来没有受任何限制。没有一次谈话像在南朝鲜那样，是在敌对的气氛下由武装人员看着进行的。红十字会人员提出的要求，只要合理和可能总是得到战俘营当局答应的。加拿大红十字会的艾伯特·巴敦因此能够在第三战俘营和几个加拿大战俘随意畅谈，他对这点很满意。
    美国、英国、丹麦、土耳其、加拿大和南朝鲜的红十字会人员在这十七天中，都亲眼看到了朝中人民军队一贯的宽待战俘的政策是怎样实施的。
