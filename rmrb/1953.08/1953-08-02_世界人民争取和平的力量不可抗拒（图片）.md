The World People's Peace Congress, held in Vienna, the capital of Austria, in December 1952, marked an unprecedented upsurge in the world's peace forces. At the meeting, peace representatives from 85 countries on all continents unanimously demanded an end to the Korean War and a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The picture shows the opening ceremony of the congress.

The World Peace Council meeting was held in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, from June 15 to June 20, 1953.

The meeting discussed world peace and security, as well as easing international tensions.

In Europe, the call for opposition to war and demand for peace is growing.

This is the famous progressive lawyer, Pritt, giving a report at the conference.

The West German people are increasingly strongly opposed to the US policy of remilitarizing their country and accelerating the establishment of a West German army. More and more Germans are participating in the struggle for peace. This is a demonstration parade held by the West German people in Bonn against the rearmament of West Germany.

The US war-mongers' aggressive plan to accelerate the establishment of a "European Army" has been met with strong resistance from the people of Western European countries. The people of Western Europe do not want war. This is a demonstration parade by the French people against the arrival of the "European Army" commander-in-chief, the defeated American general Ridgway, in France.
