The Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association held its first Chinese painting exhibition from July 31st to August 13th, receiving a warm welcome from the people of the capital.

The exhibition featured 361 works by 197 Chinese painters, including landscapes, figures, and flowers and birds, with works by famous Beijing Chinese painting masters such as Qi Baishi, Chen Banding, Yu Feian, and Xu Yansun. Many works promoted the excellent realist tradition of Chinese painting, with vivid and natural depictions and powerful brushstrokes. Some figure paintings reflected the content of real life; some landscape paintings also reflected new thoughts and feelings, captivating the audience, which demonstrated a new atmosphere in the development path of Chinese painting.

During the exhibition, there were more than 30,000 visitors. During the preview and exhibition, Central People's Government Vice Chairman Li Jishen, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, Government Administration Council Cultural and Educational Committee Director Guo Moruo, Central People's Government Committee Member Xu Teli, and Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China Hu Qiaomu all visited.

The Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association was reorganized from the Beijing New Chinese Painting Research Association, which was established in August 1949. After three years of political study, the association's more than 200 members have actively engaged in creative activities. Before the opening of the exhibition, the members organized mutual observation and study, and held separate seminars for landscape, figure, and flower-and-bird painting groups to discuss the problems existing in Chinese painting creation, and carefully selected the exhibited works. During the exhibition, the Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association also invited famous artists, art theory critics, and writers in the capital—Jiang Feng, Cai Ruohong, Hua Junwu, Ai Qing, Shao Yu, etc.—to hold a symposium on the creation of Chinese painting. The discussion affirmed that Chinese painting should promote the excellent techniques of our country's traditional art, and pointed out that Chinese painting should take realism as its creative direction in the future.

    北京中国画研究会举行画展
    北京中国画研究会在七月三十一日到八月十三日举行中国画第一届展览会，受到首都人民的热烈欢迎。
    此次国画展出中，有国画家一百九十七人的作品三百六十一件，包括山水、人物、花鸟等，内有北京著名国画大师齐白石、陈半丁、于非暗、徐燕荪等的作品。有许多作品发扬了我国绘画的写实主义优良传统，画得生动自然，笔调雄健。在人物画里有的表现了现实生活的内容；部分山水画也反映了新的思想感情，引人入胜；这显示了国画发展道路上的新气象。
    在展览期间，观众达三万多人。在预展和展览中，中央人民政府副主席李济深，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席陈叔通，政务院文化教育委员会主任郭沫若，中央人民政府委员徐特立，中共中央宣传部副部长胡乔木等都曾前往参观。
    北京中国画研究会是由一九四九年八月成立的北京新国画研究会改组而成的。该会二百多名会员，经过三年来的政治学习后，都积极展开了创作活动。展览会开幕前，会员们曾组织相互观摩学习，分别召开山水、人物、花鸟等三个小组座谈会，讨论了国画创作中存在的问题，并慎重地评选了展出的作品。展览期间，北京中国画研究会并邀请首都著名美术家、艺术理论批评家、作家——江丰、蔡若虹、华君武、艾青、邵宇等举行关于中国画创作问题座谈会，在讨论中肯定了国画应发扬我国传统艺术的优良技巧，并指出今后国画应以现实主义为创作方向。      （新华社）
