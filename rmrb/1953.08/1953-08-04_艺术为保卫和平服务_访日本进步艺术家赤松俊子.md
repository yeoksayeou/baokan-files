    Art Serves to Defend Peace
    ——A Visit with Japanese Progressive Artist Toshiko Akamatsu
    Tan Wenrui
    Toshiko Akamatsu’s name may have been familiar only to the Japanese people a few months ago, but now it is no longer unfamiliar to the vast peace-loving people of the world. The "Atomic Bomb Paintings," co-created by Toshiko Akamatsu and her husband, Iri Maruki, played a certain role in the propaganda struggle of the Japanese peace-loving people against weapons of mass destruction, and were therefore awarded the International Peace Gold Medal by the World Peace Council. Recently, Toshiko Akamatsu represented Japanese women at the World Women's Congress in Copenhagen. After the conference, she was invited by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to visit China. I went to interview her to ask her about her artistic life and her experience in participating in the struggle to defend peace.
    Akamatsu Toshiko’s dignified appearance and gentle and steady demeanor give people an impression of simplicity and sincerity. Her short hair and full cheeks make her look young and energetic. A pair of beautiful eyes reveal the wisdom of an artist and the tenderness of a loving mother. Her voice is very low, and she does not raise her voice even when she is occasionally excited, as if she was born to dislike violence. But from her meaningful smile and firm gaze, one can see the strong feelings of love and hate hidden in her heart, as well as her fortitude.
    The "Atomic Bomb Paintings" they created together are works of high artistic and ideological value. With realistic content and creative imagination, they depict the tragic disasters caused by the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the eve of the end of World War II. The perfect combination of Akamatsu Toshiko’s Western-style drawing sketches and Maruki Iri’s ink painting brushstrokes makes this work create realistic images while maintaining the Japanese national style, so it is loved by the vast Japanese people, touches their hearts, and arouses their hatred for this inhuman weapon of mass destruction and for war.
    Akamatsu Toshiko spoke to me about the motives and intentions behind their creation of this work. Hiroshima, which was bombed by the American atomic bomb on August 6, 1945, is Maruki Iri’s hometown. Shortly after Hiroshima was bombed, the couple rushed there from Tokyo to visit their family, and thus witnessed the tragedy at that time. They stayed in Hiroshima for a month, helping people bury bodies and clean up ruins, and had an indelible impression of the crime of the United States slaughtering innocent people with atomic bombs. Not long after the end of World War II, American warmongers were frantically clamoring for a new war and threatening to use inhumane atomic weapons. Therefore, Akamatsu Toshiko and Maruki Iri decided to expose the crimes of atomic warfare they had witnessed to the Japanese people and urge them to rise up and stop the new war conspiracy of the American war dealers.
    From Akamatsu Toshiko's conversation, I realized that the reason why she and Maruki Iri were able to create such deeply moving works of art was not only because they had outstanding artistic talent and artistic accomplishment, but more importantly because they had a deep love for humanity and an unparalleled hatred for wars of aggression. They were convinced that struggling for the peace and happiness of mankind was the noblest cause, so they bravely threw themselves into this struggle, using their brushes as weapons to call on the vast Japanese people to rise up to oppose aggression and defend peace.
    Knowing Akamatsu Toshiko’s past, we can easily understand why she chose this path. Akamatsu Toshiko is the daughter of a monk, and her family was poor. She loved art since she was a child and studied painting at the Tokyo Women's Art School. But after graduating, she became unemployed and had to sell paintings on the street for a living. This difficult period of life brought her closer to the masses and allowed her to experience life. She realized that the people are the highest evaluators of art, and only by understanding the thoughts and feelings of the people can one create living works of art. Later, she went abroad to the Soviet Union twice, working as a tutor in the Japanese Embassy in Moscow; she also went to various parts of Southeast Asia to sketch, which greatly broadened her horizons. Especially during her year and a half in the Soviet Union, she learned many things and her thinking was greatly improved. After returning to China, she saw the arrogance of the Japanese fascist forces, and soon Hitler's Germany launched a war of aggression against the Soviet Union, colluding with Japanese imperialism. She felt infinite grief and indignation in her heart, and together with Maruki Iri, she decided to dedicate herself to the anti-fascist movement. With the encouragement and help of Maruki Iri, Akamatsu Toshiko held an exhibition of her works painted in the Soviet Union to enhance the Japanese people's understanding and friendship with the Soviet Union. Afterwards, the two of them continuously depicted the hunger, poverty and other sufferings caused to the Japanese people by the war of aggression at home. They held exhibitions frequently, regardless of difficulties, hoping to help stop the aggression of the Japanese militarists. In 1945, Japanese imperialism was defeated and the United States imperialism occupied Japan, turning Japan into a new base of aggression and colony, and the Japanese people fell into new disasters. Therefore, in 1947, they decided to start painting the "Atomic Bomb Paintings."
    The Maruki couple devoted a great deal of effort to the creation of the "Atomic Bomb Paintings." For the preparation of the creation, they drew 500 sketches of human bodies, and tried all kinds of methods to deepen their sympathy for the pain and misfortune of the innocent victims, cultivate their feelings of grief and hatred, and transform these emotions into powerful accusations on the screen. In the process of creation, the authors were constantly threatened and obstructed by reactionary elements, but the will to strive for peace and the conscience of artists made them fearless and unafraid of difficulties. Ms. Akamatsu Toshiko said: "We often think that the Japanese people want us to complete such a work." Therefore, they gained infinite courage.
    At the beginning of 1950, they exhibited the first part of the "Atomic Bomb Paintings," which immediately attracted the attention of the vast Japanese people. People all over Japan eagerly wanted to see this work, so the "Atomic Bomb Paintings" were exhibited in many cities under the auspices of local peace movement organizations. Later, the original paintings were photographed and exhibited in more places. Up to now, the "Atomic Bomb Paintings" have been exhibited more than 400 times, with more than 3 million visitors. This work has had a huge impact among the Japanese people. Many people have seen the crime of the United States using atomic bombs to slaughter innocent Japanese people, and they deeply hate it, thus realizing the necessity of defending peace. Many visitors wrote their will to oppose war in the opinion book. An old soldier wrote: "After seeing these pictures, I would rather die than participate in the war again!" Another visitor said: "I used to agree to rearmament, but now I understand that I must firmly oppose it."
    The exhibition of "Atomic Bomb Paintings" has received enthusiastic support and help from the people. Ms. Akamatsu Toshiko said: Only the first exhibition was planned and organized by themselves. The subsequent hundreds of exhibitions were organized by enthusiastic people who love peace. Many people volunteered to participate in the arrangement and publicity work, and some were even arrested for this. The reason why the "Atomic Bomb Paintings" have received widespread concern and support from the Japanese people is mainly because it reflects their desire to oppose war. Akamatsu Toshiko and Maruki Iri used the exhibition to carry out a campaign to collect signatures for peace, which achieved great results. Ms. Akamatsu told me such a story. Once, she was calling on people at an exhibition in Tokyo to oppose the use of atomic weapons, and an American officer maliciously asked Akamatsu Toshiko: "Where do you not want the atomic bomb to be dropped?" Akamatsu Toshiko bluntly replied to him: "I don't want the atomic bomb to be dropped on Japan again, nor do I want the atomic bomb to be dropped anywhere in the world. Do you want the atomic bomb to be dropped on New York?" The two of them argued, and Akamatsu Toshiko said to the other people: "You have all heard the argument between me and this American. Those who agree with my opinion please sign the peace declaration." At that time, people immediately rushed to sign the peace declaration. That American believer in atomic bombs had to leave embarrassingly.
    The exhibition of "Atomic Bomb Paintings" later became a base for the Japanese people's peace movement. Poets went there to write poems, musicians went there to compose music, dancers went there to dance, and peace movement workers went there to work. The influence is expanding day by day. The paintings of Akamatsu Toshiko and Maruki Iri have also become shared by the Japanese people who love peace. Therefore, Ms. Akamatsu Toshiko said when she talked about her feelings about winning the International Peace Gold Medal: "I feel an honor I have never had in my life, but I think this honor should belong to the millions of Japanese people who love peace and fight to defend peace."
    Ms. Akamatsu Toshiko told me that she is just one of the many Japanese progressive art workers. The vast number of Japanese progressive artists have also chosen the same path as her, using their artistic talents to serve the defense of peace. Now the progressive art workers in Japan are united around the Avant-Garde Art Association and the Japan Art Association, two progressive organizations, using their works to reflect the suffering and struggle of the Japanese people under the rule of the US-Japan reactionaries. Their ranks are expanding day by day, and their activities are becoming more and more active. The annual Peace Art Festival is a grand review and demonstration of their work, and they exhibit many militant works. Opposing rearmament and militarization, expelling American occupiers, etc., are all widely adopted themes by artists. The progressive artists not only reflect the Japanese people's will to strive for peace and independence, but also mobilize more people to participate in the struggle.
    In fact, the Japanese people's struggle for peace and independence is rising higher and higher. The victory of Japanese women in this struggle to participate in the World Women's Congress is a good illustration. Before the World Women's Congress was held, Japanese women launched a wide-ranging mass movement, publicizing the significance of the conference in various places, electing representatives to attend the conference, and raising funds to finance participation in the conference, all of which achieved good results. In late May, a Japanese Women's Congress with 500 representatives was held to discuss issues related to peace and women, and a representative delegation with broad representation was elected to attend the World Women's Congress. The Japanese reactionary government attempted to prevent them from going abroad by refusing to issue passports, but Japanese women waged a tenacious struggle. With the support of progressive public opinion, they finally forced the Japanese government to issue passports to the representatives. This is not only a great victory for the Japanese women's movement, but also a great victory for the Japanese people's peace movement.
    Ms. Akamatsu Toshiko finally talked about her impressions of this visit to the Soviet Union and China. She said: "The Soviet people have suffered serious damage from the war, and they deeply hate war. This time I saw the Soviet people's unparalleled enthusiasm for peaceful construction in the Soviet Union, which made me more convinced of the Soviet people's will to defend peace. We must stand with the Soviet people to fight for the defense of peace." In China, she also saw the same situation: the Chinese people are working happily and actively engaged in peaceful construction, and everything is full of vitality. Her mood is both excited and sad. Excited because she saw her own brothers creating their own peaceful and happy life, and sad because she thought of the situation of the Japanese people. Akamatsu Toshiko said: When she and several Japanese women representatives saw the workers working happily for their own future at the Guanting Reservoir construction site, they couldn't help but shed tears, because they remembered that Japan had not built any water conservancy projects in the eight years since the end of the war, and therefore suffered serious floods recently. In many other places, they often had the same feelings. For example, when they saw the great creative power of the Chinese people, they were very moved. At the same time, thinking that the creativity of the Japanese people was buried, and even their lives were strangled, they felt unspeakable grief and indignation. But everything they saw in China strengthened their determination to fight for peace and freedom. Akamatsu Toshiko resolutely said:
    "After we return to China, we must step up the struggle. When we encounter difficulties, as long as we think of the Chinese people who have overcome difficulties and achieved victory, we will surely have a hundred times the courage to break through difficulties and move forward. The Japanese people will surely be able to strive for a future like the Chinese people in the near future." Akamatsu Toshiko said that she will devote herself to depicting the struggle of the Japanese people in the future, and hopes that one day she will be able to praise the happy life of the Japanese people after they have achieved peace and independence. We firmly believe that Akamatsu Toshiko’s hope will surely be realized; the Japanese people’s struggle for peace and independence is growing day by day, and the day when she paints the happy smiling faces of the Japanese people will eventually come.

    艺术为保卫和平服务
    ——访日本进步艺术家赤松俊子
    谭文瑞
    赤松俊子的名字，几个月前也许只为日本人民所熟悉，可是现在对于全世界广大爱好和平的人民都不是陌生的了。赤松俊子和她丈夫丸木位里合绘的“原子弹之画”，在日本爱好和平人民反对大量杀人武器的宣传斗争中起了一定作用，因而荣获世界和平理事会的国际和平金质奖章。最近赤松俊子代表日本妇女到哥本哈根出席世界妇女大会，会后应我国民主妇女联合会的邀请，到中国来观光。记者特前往访问，请她讲述她的艺术生活以及她参加保卫和平斗争的经历。
    赤松俊子端庄的容貌和温文持重的举止，给人一种纯朴和诚挚的印象。短短的头发和丰满的两颊使她显得年青而富有活力。一双秀丽的眼睛流露出艺术家的智慧和慈母的柔情。她说话声音很低沉，即使在偶尔激动的时候也不会提高嗓音，仿佛她生来就嫌恶暴力似的。但是从她那意味深长的微笑和坚定不移的目光，人们可以看出她内心蕴藏着强烈的爱憎的感情，以及她那刚毅的性格。
    他们夫妇合作的“原子弹之画”是一部具有高度艺术性和思想性的作品。他们以现实的内容和创造性的想像，描绘出第二次世界大战结束的前夕美国在广岛和长崎投掷原子弹所造成惨酷的灾祸。赤松俊子的西洋画的素描和丸木位里的水墨画的落墨完美地结合，使这一作品创造了有真实感的形象，同时保持了日本的民族风格，因此为广大日本人民所喜爱，并打动他们的心弦，激起他们对这种惨无人道的杀人武器以及对战争的憎恨。
    赤松俊子和记者谈到他们创作这一作品的动机和意图。一九四五年八月六日遭受美国原子弹轰炸的广岛，是丸木位里的家乡。广岛被炸后不久，他们夫妇曾经从东京赶往那里探视他们的家人，因此目睹了当时的惨象。他们在广岛逗留了一个月之久，帮助人们掩埋尸体，收拾废墟，对美国以原子弹屠杀无辜人民的罪恶，有着不可磨灭的印象。在第二次世界大战结束不久，美国的好战分子又疯狂地在叫嚣发动新的战争，并威胁要使用灭绝人性的原子武器，因此赤松俊子和丸木位里便决定要把他们所看到的原子战争的罪恶向日本人民揭露，促使他们起来制止美国战争贩子新的战争阴谋。
    从赤松俊子的谈话中，记者体会到：她和丸木位里所以能创作这样深入人心的艺术作品，不只是因为他们具有杰出的艺术天才和艺术素养，更主要的是因为他们有着对人类的深切热爱和对侵略战争的无比痛恨。他们确信为人类的和平和幸福而斗争是最崇高的事业，因此他们勇敢地投身于这一斗争之中，用他们的画笔作为武器，号召广大的日本人民起来反对侵略、捍卫和平。
    知道了赤松俊子的过去，我们便很容易理解她为什么会选择这样的道路。赤松俊子是一个僧侣的女儿，家道清贫。她从小就爱好艺术，曾在东京的女子艺术专门学校学习绘画。但是毕业后便失业了，她只好在街头鬻画为生。这一段刻苦的生涯使她接近了群众，体验了生活，她认识到，人民群众才是艺术的最高的评价者，只有体会人民群众的思想感情，才能创作出有生命的艺术作品。后来她两度出国到苏联，在莫斯科的日本大使馆中任家庭教师；又曾到南洋各地写生，这就使她的眼界大大的开阔。特别是在苏联的一年半，她学习了许多的东西，思想上有了很大的提高。回国后，她看到了日本法西斯势力的嚣张，不久希特勒德国并发动了侵略苏联的战争，与日本帝国主义连成一气，她心中感到无限的悲愤，便与丸木位里决心献身于反法西
    斯的运动。赤松俊子在丸木位里的鼓励与帮助下，把她在苏联所画的作品举行了展览，以增进日本人
    民对苏联的了解和友谊。以后他们两人在国内不断
    描绘侵略战争给日本人民所造成的饥饿和贫困等痛苦，他们不顾困难，经常举行展览会，希望能有助于制止日本军国主义者的侵略。一九四五年日本帝国主义战败，美国帝国主义占领了日本，把日本变成了新的侵略基地和殖民地，日本人民又陷入新的劫难之中。于是在一九四七年，他们决定开始画“原子弹之画”。
    丸木夫妇从事“原子弹之画”的创作是费尽了心力的。他们为了创作的准备曾描画了五百帧人体的素描，并想尽各样的方法来加深他们对无辜的受害者的痛苦与不幸的同情，培育自己悲愤和痛恨的情绪，而把这种情绪在画面上化成有力的控诉。在创作的过程中，作者不断受到反动分子的恐吓和阻挠，但是争取和平的意志和艺术家的良心使他们不知恐惧，不畏困难。赤松俊子女士说：“我们时常想到，日本人民要我们完成这样的工作。”因此，他们就获得了无限的勇气。
    到一九五○年初，他们展出了“原子弹之画”的第一部，当即引起了广大日本人民的注意。日本各地人民都热烈渴望观看这一作品，于是“原子弹之画”在各地方和平运动组织的主持下，在许多城市中巡回展览，后来并把原画拍成照片，在更多的地方展出。到现在，“原子弹之画”已展览了四百次以上，参观者超过三百多万人。这一作品在日本人民中间发生了巨大的影响，许多人看到了美国利用原子弹屠杀日本无辜人民的罪行，莫不深切痛恨，从而认识到保卫和平的必要性。许多参观者在意见本上写出他们反对战争的意志。一个旧军人写道：“我看了这些图画，宁死也不愿再参加战争！”另外一个参观者说：“我曾经赞同重新武装，如今我
    明白必须坚决反对它了。”
    “原子弹之画”的展览受到人民群众的热烈支持
    和帮助。赤松俊子女士说：只有第一次展览是他们
    自己筹划和主办的，以后几百次都是由爱好和平的
    热心人士所组织。许多人自动参加布置和宣传工
    作，有一些人甚至因此而被捕。“原子弹之画”所
    以得到日本人民的广泛关怀和支持，主要是因为它
    反映了他们心中反对战争的愿望。赤松俊子和丸木
    位里曾利用展览会进行征集和平签名的运动，收到了很大的效果。赤松女士告诉记者这样一个故事。有一次她在东京的展览会上号召人们反对使用原子武器，在场的一个美国军官恶意地问赤松俊子说：“你不愿意原子弹投在什么地方呢？”赤松俊子直率地回答他道：“我不愿原子弹再投在日本，也不愿原子弹投在世界任何一个地方。难道你愿意原子弹投在纽约吗？”他们两人便争论起来，赤松俊子对其他群众说：“你们都听到了我和这个美国人的争论，谁同意我的意见的便请签名在和平宣言上吧。”当时人们立即争着在和平宣言上签名。那个美国的原子弹信徒只好尴尬地离去。
    “原子弹之画”的展览会后来成为了日本人民保卫和平运动的一个阵地，诗人们到那里去写诗，音乐家到那里去作曲，舞蹈家到那里去跳舞，和平运动工作者到那里进行工作。影响一天比一天扩大。赤松俊子和丸木位里的画也变成了为日本爱好和平的人民所共有。因此赤松俊子女士谈到她荣获国际和平金质奖章的感想说：“我感到有生以来从未有过的光荣，但是我认为这荣誉应该属于千百万爱好和平并为保卫和平而斗争的日本人民。”
    赤松俊子女士对记者说：她只不过是许多日本进步艺术工作者中的一个。广大的日本进步艺术家也选择了和她同样的道路，以他们的艺术才能为保卫和平服务。现在日本进步的美术工作者都团结在前卫美术会和日本美术会这两个进步组织的周围，用他们的作品反映在美日反动派统治下的日本人民的疾苦和斗争。他们的队伍一天比一天扩大，他们的活动也愈来愈活跃了。每年举行一次和平美术节，是他们的一次大检阅和示威，他们展出许多具有战斗性的作品。如反对重新武装和军事基地化、驱逐美国占领者等，都是被艺术家们广泛采用的主题。进步的艺术家们一方面反映日本人民争取和平与独
    立的意志，一方面动员更多的人民参加斗争。
    事实上，日本人民争取和平与独立的斗争是愈来
    愈高涨。日本妇女这一次为了争取参加世界妇女大
    会而进行的斗争取得了胜利，就是很好的说明。在
    世界妇女大会召开之前，日本妇女便展开了广泛的
    群众性运动，在各地宣传大会的意义，推选出席大
    会的代表和为筹集参加大会的经费而募款，都收到了很好的效果。五月下旬并举行了有五百名代表参加的日本妇女代表大会，讨论了有关和平与妇女问题，并产生了具有广泛代表性的代表团出席世界妇女大会。日本反动政府企图以拒发护照的手段阻止她们出国，但是日本妇女进行了顽强的斗争，在进步舆论的支持下，终于迫使日本政府发给了代表们护照。这不仅是日本妇女运动的一大胜利，而且也是日本人民保卫和平运动的一大胜利。
    赤松俊子女士最后谈到这次访问苏联和中国的观感。她说：“苏联人民曾遭受战争的严重损害，他们对于战争深恶痛绝。我这次在苏联看到了苏联人民从事和平建设的无比高涨的热情，使我更加坚信苏联人民保卫和平的意志。我们一定要和苏联人民在一起为保卫和平而斗争。”在中国，她也看到相同的情况：中国人民愉快地劳动，积极从事和平建设，到处都是生气勃勃的，她的心情是又兴奋，又难过。兴奋的是因为看见了亲兄弟在创造着自己的和平幸福的生活，难过的是因为想到了日本人民的境遇。赤松俊子说：当她和几位日本妇女代表在官厅水库工地上看到了工人们愉快地为自己的将来而劳动，都不禁掉下了眼泪，因为她们想起了日本战争结束了八年，也没有修建过任何的水利工程，因而最近遭受了严重的水灾。在其他许多地方，她们也常常有同样的感触。例如看到中国人民伟大的创造力量，她们十分感动，同时想到日本人民的创造力被埋没，甚至连生命都被扼杀，感到难言的悲愤。但是她们在中国所看见的一切，更增强了她们为和平与自由而斗争的决心。赤松俊子坚决地说：
    “我们回国后，一定要加紧斗争，遇到困难的时候，只要想到克服困难取得了胜利的中国人民，就
    一定会勇气百倍，突破困难前进。日本人民不久将来也一定能争取像中国人民这样的前途。”赤松俊子说：她以后将全力去描绘日本人民的斗争，并希望将来有一天能够赞颂日本人民获得了和平与独立之后的幸福生活。我们深信：赤松俊子的希望是一定能够实现的；日本人民争取和平独立斗争正日益增长，她描画日本人民愉快的笑脸的日子是终会到来的。
