Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 6th—The Chinese Youth Art Troupe, participating in the Fourth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival, gave its first official performance in Bucharest on the 4th, receiving a warm welcome from the audience.

After the performance began, the Chinese Youth Art Troupe Choir sang songs such as "People of the World, One Heart," "Ode to the Motherland," and "Half a Moon Climbing Up." When the choir finished singing the Romanian folk song "Song of the Peace Fighters," the audience applauded enthusiastically. The performers took three curtain calls, but the audience could not be calmed down, so they sang another Xinjiang folk song, "Alamuhan."

The Chinese Youth Art Troupe's dance team, acrobatic team, and classical opera and dance drama team then performed dances such as the Lotus Lantern Dance, Lion Dance, Red Silk Dance, acrobatics such as Grand Martial Arts, Jars, and Vehicle Skills, and Peking Opera excerpts "Autumn River" and "Havoc in Heaven."

The "Spark" newspaper published a news report on the Chinese Youth Art Troupe's official performance on the 5th, praising the programs performed by the Chinese Youth Art Troupe as being full of optimism and having a high level of artistic skill. "Spark" said that the light and graceful "Lotus Lantern Dance" left a deep impression on the audience, and the "Lion Dance" with its strong folk flavor was also extremely popular with the audience.
