    From Darkness to Light
    Gao Qinmin
    In the autumn of 1948, not long after the Mid-Autumn Festival, around seven o'clock one evening, the People's Liberation Army besieging Jinan launched a general offensive. At that time, I was still a soldier in the Kuomintang reactionary army. The initial order was: "Hold the position, do not retreat, anyone who retreats will be shot." However, not long after the fighting started, another order was received: "Cease fire immediately, change defenses." Everyone was issued a red armband. As it turned out, no one saw a relief force, and the troops were assembled, with entire battalions and regiments withdrawing from the front lines. In a daze, everyone reached the Yellow River, only then realizing the troops had revolted.
    Not long after, a person came to the company headquarters. He wasn't tall, a bit plump, with a smiling face. He carried a neatly packed yellow quilt roll and a porcelain bowl wrapped in white cloth, with a bright red five-pointed star sewn on the opening, hanging from the quilt roll.
    During evening roll call, the company commander introduced him: "This is Instructor Li." I was taken aback, thinking, "Does an instructor carry his own quilt roll?" I carefully looked him over from head to toe: not fierce at all, with a red face and always smiling, not like an officer at all, just like a regular soldier. But in my mind, I was still a little afraid of him, wanting to avoid him when I saw him.
    The next day, I went to the well to fetch water to wash my clothes. Carrying the water buckets, I walked to the big tree beside the well. Looking up, I saw that Instructor Li was at the well, busily washing things. I quickly put down the water buckets and walked back slowly and quietly. When I was far enough away, estimating that he couldn't see me, I ran back to the room in a hurry. As soon as I entered, everyone asked, "Where's the water you fetched?" I angrily said, "At the well!" "Why didn't you bring it?" "Instructor Li is washing things there, I'll go fetch it after he's done. Whoever can't wait can go, I'm not going now." Everyone felt the same as me, not one dared to go. They just felt very strange, why did the instructor have to wash clothes himself? After a while, Instructor Li came back smiling, carrying the water. Everyone was stunned and exclaimed in surprise, "Instructor, why are you fetching water for us? That's not right, you're the instructor!" He said, "It's okay, I have to fetch water every day." He smiled, grabbed my hand, and asked, "Why did you come back?" I stared and stammered, "Seeing you... busy there, I... I came back." He asked me my name. After I told him, he patted my shoulder and said, "Do you still think we're like the officers in the Kuomintang army? No, we are all beloved comrades, the people's army..." What he said warmed my heart. After that, he went to each squad every day to talk to everyone. Over time, if anyone had any difficulties, they would automatically go to him. No matter when they went to him, he treated us all kindly, doing his best to solve any problems for us. He treated the comrades like his own brothers. Once, Li Weiqi, Zou Bincheng, and I were very ill, our nostrils were bleeding. The instructor, afraid that we would infect others, found another house for the three of us to live in separately. Although others also came to bring water and food, no one took care of us as well as the instructor. He told Li Wenqing to find a doctor and used his own allowance, which he hadn't been willing to spend for half a year, to buy some candy and eggs for us to eat. He would come and ask every now and then, "What do you want to eat? We'll find a way to buy it." At this point, I wanted to sit up and say a few words of gratitude, but looking at the eggs on the bedside table, the candy, oranges, and pomegranates, and the biscuits, my heart ached, and I couldn't say a word before tears fell.
    I remembered the situation when I was conscripted into the Kuomintang army, I remembered the painful life in the reactionary army.
    It was in the autumn of 1946, the soybeans were almost ripe. My mother and I went to the field to take a look. The soybean pods were swollen and yellow, truly delightful! My mother said, "After these two mu of soybeans are harvested, besides handing over grain and setting aside some for the winter, we'll get a few yards of cloth to make cotton robes for you and your younger brother." When I heard that she was going to make cotton robes for me and my younger brother, I was very happy! I skipped and jumped home. As soon as I entered the door, my heart skipped a beat. I saw the Baozhang (township head) and the lackey Li Er sitting in our courtyard. My father's face had turned snow-white. I didn't know why. When my mother came in, the Baozhang tilted up his fat pig face and said, "Auntie! Last time we weren't asked to provide a soldier, this time it's our family's turn. See who's going?" Seeing that my mother didn't say anything, he said, "Let the second son go!" My mother stammered, "The second son is still young, can't we wait two more years? Besides, I can't do without him." The Baozhang immediately turned his face, slammed his "civilized cane" on the ground and said, "No! This is the order of the Central Army, who dares to disobey! If he's small, he can be a messenger, come with me!" As soon as I heard "go," I suddenly threw myself in front of my mother and cried. I cried, but my mother didn't cry. She was dazed, staring straight ahead, blood flowing from her lips, dripping on my head. When I saw that my mother was so angry that she had bitten her lips, I stopped crying and said to my mother, "Mom! Don't be sad, I'll go! Anyway, we poor people have no choice. If I die, there's still my younger brother, there will always be a day to rise up!" From then on, I left my warm home. At the same time, Uncle Yuming, Brother Chunmin, and twenty other people were also conscripted.
    One night, we were sent to a large courtyard in the city, the courtyard was densely packed with people, all conscripted soldiers. After a while, a reactionary army officer came, holding a rattan cane in his hand. He drove the people out of the courtyard. I had only taken two steps when I felt dizzy and my vision went black. I asked Uncle Yuming, "Why am I so dizzy?" As soon as I asked, tears fell from Uncle Yuming's eyes. He said, "Haven't you eaten for days?" I replied unnaturally, "More than two days." Uncle Yuming said he would carry me. I thought, "Hasn't he eaten either?" So I didn't let him carry me and walked slowly. When I reached the assembly field outside the gate, they called the roll and quickly assigned me to a unit. From then on, I began to live a life worse than cattle or horses.
    In the "ill-fated army," there was no freedom at all. There were twelve people in our squad, seven of whom were conscripted together, but we were never allowed to say a word to each other, and someone was always watching us when we went out. One afternoon, just after returning from drill, seven of us gathered together to talk. At this time, the barbarian squad leader ran over furiously and slapped me without asking any questions, insisting that we were going to desert. He immediately tied me up and interrogated me, demanding that I confess the situation of our planned escape. I refused to say anything, and in the end, they locked me in a straw shed for three days, where I had to relieve myself, eat, and sleep. Fortunately, they set off, and I was released and returned to the squad. During marches, we had to carry ammunition. When we were stationed, we had to dig fortifications. Any mistake would result in scolding or beatings. There was really no one to talk to, no one to tell our troubles to. This kind of life continued until the uprising.
    But now, the officers no longer beat or scold us, the brothers are much more affectionate with each other, and the instructor is so good to the brothers. When we are sick, he takes care of us even more attentively than our own families. How could I not be moved?
    Soon, a letter came from the regiment, asking me to work in the logistics guard platoon. I said to myself, "I won't go! There's no instructor as good as him there." No matter what the platoon leader said, I wouldn't go. The deputy company commander, who had revolted with me, said, "This is an order, you have to go. A soldier's duty is to obey orders." Just as he was speaking, the instructor came over smiling, touching his mouth. He called me over to him, poured me a bowl of water, and didn't say it was an order that I had to go. He just said, "Today is a revolutionary army, led by the Communist Party. It's the same no matter where you go, it's not like before..." I said, "Instructor, you're too good to me, I don't want to leave you." The instructor said, "It's not that I'm so good to you, it's that Chairman Mao wants me to be so good to you. The entire army is educated by Chairman Mao, everyone will be this good to you." I understood a little. Seeing that I didn't say anything, the instructor added, "If there are any problems, come find me again, I guarantee I'll solve them for you." I said, "Instructor, if it's not good there, I'll definitely come back!" The instructor just smiled. After lunch, I went to the second squad of the logistics guard platoon. As soon as I entered the door, everyone rushed to take my backpack, move a stool, pour water for me. The squad leader took out cigarettes, Little Yan bought some peanuts, and someone even made my bed. This stunned me. Why were they so polite? What the instructor said was true. I immediately thought, "The People's Liberation Army led by the Communist Party is really the same everywhere. In the reactionary army, if a new recruit went, he would have to do hard labor for a few days, fetching water, sweeping the floor, and if he ran into the squad leader, he would have to wash his clothes. If he didn't wash them well, he would be scolded and beaten..."
    After crossing the Yangtze River in 1949, I contracted malaria and had a fever of over 40 degrees Celsius. I hadn't eaten anything for two days, and it really made me delirious. I just vomited in bed. At that time, there were no spittoons. When the squad leader saw that I was about to vomit, he didn't have time to find anything and used his new handkerchief, holding it in his hand, to catch it in front of my mouth. I waved my hand, not wanting to vomit, but involuntarily "wah!" I vomited on his handkerchief. After I finished vomiting, he took it out quickly, and the other comrades quickly supported me and brought water for me to rinse my mouth. When the squad leader came back, he bought a pound of big apples. I felt very sorry and said, "Squad leader, you got your handkerchief dirty, what will you use? And you bought this..." The squad leader said softly, "It's okay that the handkerchief is dirty, you just rest well!"
    At night, everyone slept soundly, but the squad leader always got up to check on me several times, tucking me in, putting down the mosquito net, and even using a flashlight to check inside the mosquito net for mosquitoes. These things moved me to tears. After I recovered, he also helped me study. When I didn't have a pen, he lent me a new Xinmin brand fountain pen. If we didn't understand the discussion questions the instructor gave us after class, he would always explain them in detail. At this time, I remembered what Instructor Li had said to me when I left: "Today is a revolutionary army, led by the Communist Party. It's the same no matter where you go." It's really not false at all.

    从黑暗走向光明
    高钦民
    一九四八年中秋节过后不久的一天晚上七点来钟，包围济南的人民解放军开始总攻了。我当时还在国民党反动派军队当兵，开始来的命令是：“守住阵地，不能后退，谁要后退，就挨枪毙。”可是，打了还没有多大一会，又接到了个命令：“停止射击，马上换防。”每人发了个红袖章，结果也没看到一个接防的，队伍就集合了，整营、整团地撤出了火线，大家迷迷糊糊到了黄河边，这才知道部队起义了。
    过了不久，连部来了个人，身材不高，胖胖的，满脸笑容。背着个打得很整齐的黄被包，挂包上挂着个用白布包起来的瓷碗，口上还缝了个鲜红的五角星。
    晚上点名时，连长介绍说：“这是李指导员。”我吃了一惊，心里想：“指导员还背被包吗？”就很注意地把他从头到脚看了一遍：一点也不恶，脸上红红的，还老带着笑，那里像个官，简直和大兵一样。但是思想上对他总有些害怕，看见他就想躲着走。
    第二天，我到井上去打水洗衣服，挑着水桶走到井边的大树跟前，抬头一看，那个李指导员正在井上磕叱磕叱地洗东西。我赶忙放下水桶，轻轻地慢慢地往回走。走的远一点，估计他看不见了，三步拼成两步跑回屋子，一进门大家就问：“你挑的水呢？”我气忿忿地说：“在井边！”“为啥不挑来？”“指导员在那里洗东西，等他洗完了再去挑；谁要等不得，谁就去，现在我可不去。”大家也和我一样，没有一个敢去的。只是觉得很奇怪，为什么指导员还要洗衣服呢？过了一会，指导员笑着挑着水来了，大家不由一愣，都很惊奇地说：“指导员，你怎么给俺挑水来了，这不行，你是指导员！”他说：“没关系，我每天都要挑水的。”他笑着抓住我的手问：“你怎么回来了呢？”我瞪着眼结结巴巴地说：“见你……在那里忙着，我，……我才回来的。”他问我姓什么，我告诉了他以后，他就拍着我的肩膀说：“你还认为我们像国民党军队那些当官的吗？不是，我们都是亲爱的同志，是老百姓的队伍……。”说的我心里热呼呼的。以后他就每天到各班去跟大家谈话。时间长了，大家要有什么困难就自动去找他，不管什么时候找他，他都是和和气气地对待我们，什么问题都尽力给我们解决。他对同志们真像亲兄弟一样。有一次，李魏齐、邹斌诚和我三个病得很厉害，鼻孔里光流血，指导员怕我们传染别人，就给我们三个另找了个房子，住到一边，别人虽然也来端水送饭的，可是谁也没指导员照顾我们的好。他叫李文清去把医生找了来，还把自己半年没舍得化的津贴费拿出来买了些糖、鸡蛋给我们吃，待一会就来问问：“你们想吃点什么？咱想办法买。”这时我就翘起身子想说几句感谢的话，可是我看着铺头上的鸡蛋，桌子上的糖、橘子和石榴，还有饼干。心里一酸，话也没说出口就掉下了眼泪。
    我想起了我被国民党抓兵时的情形，我想起了在反动军队中痛苦的生活。
    那是一九四六年的秋天，豆子快熟了，我和母亲到地里去看了看，那豆荚都黄的鼓着肚子，真喜人！母亲说：“这二亩豆子打下来，除了拿粮和留出过冬的，就扯几尺布给你和弟弟做棉袍子。”我一听要给我和弟弟做棉袍子，心里真高兴！就跳跳蹦蹦地向家里跑。刚一进门，心里就激愣一下子，看见保长和狗腿子李二在俺院里坐着。父亲在一旁脸色变得雪白，我不知为的啥。等母亲走进来时，保长就把他那肥胖的猪脸一仰说：“婶子！上一回没叫咱家出兵，这回可该咱家出了，你看谁去？”他看到我妈没啃气就说：“叫二弟去吧！”母亲结结巴巴地说：“老二还小，再等两年不行吗？再说我还离不了他。”保长就立刻翻了脸，把手中的“文明棍”向地下一戳说：“不行！这是中央军的命令，谁敢违抗！个子小可以当勤务兵，跟我走！”我一听说“走”，就一下子扑到母亲的跟前哭起来了。我哭，母亲可没哭，她呆了，直瞪着眼，嘴唇上流出血来，滴在我的头上，我一看母亲气的把嘴唇也咬破了，我就不哭了，对母亲说：“妈！你不要难过，我去吧！反正咱穷人是没办法的，我死了还有弟弟呢，将来总会有出头的日子！”从此我就离开了温暖的家。和我同时被抓的，还有玉明叔，春民哥等二十一个人。
    一天夜里，我们被送进了城内一座大院子里，院子里黑压压地挤满了人，都是被抓来的兵。过了一会，走来一个反动军官，手中拿着根藤子，他把人们从院子里赶出去。我刚走了两步，就觉得天旋地转的眼前发黑。我问玉明叔：“我怎么头昏眼花的呢？”这样一问，玉明叔的眼里掉下泪来，他说：“你几天没吃饭了？”我心里很不自然地回答：“两天多了。”玉明叔说要背着我走，我想：“他不是也没吃饭吗？”就不让他背，自己慢慢地走，走到大门外集合场子里，点了名，很快地补进了队伍，从此，就开始过牛马不如的生活了。
    在“遭殃军”里是没一点自由的。我们班里十二个人，其中有七个是我们一道被抓来的，但是从来也不准我们谈一句话，出来时都有人看着。有一天下午，刚出操回来，我们七个人凑在一块说话。这时，蛮子班长就气汹汹地跑来不问青红皂白把我打了一巴掌，硬说我们要开小差。当时就把我绑起拷问我，要我供出准备逃跑的情况。我死也不说，最后，他们把我关在一个草棚子里，耽了三天，拉屎、撒尿、吃饭、睡觉都在那里面。幸亏他们出发，才把我放出来回到班里。行军就挑子弹，驻下就挖工事，一有差错，不是骂，就是打。真是有话无处说，有苦无处诉。这种生活一直过到起义时候。
    而现在，当官的也再不会打骂我们了，弟兄们也互相亲热得多了，指导员又对弟兄们这样好，我们病了，他照顾得真比自己家里还细心周到，这使我怎么能不感动呢？
    不久，团里来了信要我到后勤警卫排去工作，我就自言自语地说：“我可不去！到那里没有这样好的指导员。”排长怎样说我也是不去，和我一块起义过来的副连长说：“这是命令，不去不行，军人以服从命令为天职。”正说着，指导员笑嘻嘻地摸着嘴来了，他把我叫到他那里，给我端了碗水，也没说这是命令不去不行，只是说：“今天是革命部队，是共产党领导的，到哪里去都是一样，不是从前了……”我说：“指导员你对我太好了，我不愿离开你。”指导员说：“不是我对你这样好，是毛主席要我对你这样好的，整个部队都是毛主席教导出来的，谁也会对你这样好。”我思想上有点通了，指导员见我没吭气，又说：“要有什么问题再来找我，保证给你解决。”我说：“指导员，假若那里不好，我一定回来呀！”指导员只笑着。吃过午饭，我到了后勤警卫排第二班，一进门大家都抢着给我拿背包，搬凳子、端水，班长拿出烟，小阎买了些花生米，还有给我打铺的，这倒把我弄傻了，他们怎么这样客气，指导员说的倒是真的。我心里马上就考虑：“共产党领导的人民军队真是到哪里都是一样，要在反动军队里去个新兵，还得干上几天苦力呢，打水、扫地，碰着还得给班长洗衣服，洗得不好都得挨骂、挨揍……。”
    一九四九年渡江以后，我发起疟疾来了，发烧到了四十来度，两天没吃啥，也真把我烧迷糊了；在铺上只吐，那时没有痰盂，班长看我要吐了，来不及找东西，就把自己的新手帕，用手托着放在我嘴边接住，我用手挥动着不想吐，可不由自己就“哇！”一声吐了他一手帕，等我吐完了他才拿出去，别的同志赶快扶着我，端水给我嗽口。班长回来又买了一斤大苹果，我心里很过意不去，就说：“班长，你的手巾叫我弄脏了，你用啥？还买这个来……。”班长轻声地说：“手巾脏了不要紧，你好好地休息吧！”
    晚上大家睡的挺香，班长总是起来看几次，给我盖被子，放蚊帐，还用手灯照照蚊帐里面有没有蚊子。这些事都感动得我流泪。我病好了以后他还帮助我学习，没有笔用，他就借给我一枝新民牌的钢笔，要是指导员上了课出讨论题我们不懂，他总是详细地解释。这时我才又想起我临走时李指导员说的话：“今天是革命部队，是共产党领导的，到哪里去都是一样。”真一点也不假。
