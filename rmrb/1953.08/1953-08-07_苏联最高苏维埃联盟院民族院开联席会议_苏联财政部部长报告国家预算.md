Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 6th: According to TASS, Moscow, the Soviet Supreme Soviet of the Union and the Nationalities Council held a joint session at 7:00 PM on the 5th to hear the report by Soviet Minister of Finance A. Zverev on the 1953 Soviet State Budget and the execution of the 1951 and 1952 budgets.

When the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government, G.M. Malenkov, V.M. Molotov, N.S. Khrushchev, K.Y. Voroshilov, N.A. Bulganin, L.M. Kaganovich, A.I. Mikoyan, M.Z. Saburov, and M.G. Pervukhin, appeared on the government rostrum, all deputies and guests stood up and applauded warmly.

In his report, Soviet Minister of Finance A. Zverev emphasized that in the two and a half years since the implementation of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet people have achieved new and significant successes in developing industry, agriculture, and transportation, in further improving the people's living standards, public health, and cultural development. The expansion of the Soviet national economy has created conditions for the successful execution of the Soviet state budget. The budget execution was as follows: 1951 - revenue of 470.3 billion rubles, expenditure of 443 billion rubles; 1952 - revenue of 497.7 billion rubles, expenditure of 460.2 billion rubles. In 1952, budget expenditures for the national economy and for meeting the cultural and social needs of the people accounted for the majority of the total budget expenditure, reaching 301.6 billion rubles. Before the war, in 1940, this type of budget expenditure was 99 billion rubles, which means it has more than tripled.

Speaking of the 1953 Soviet State Budget, Zverev said that the Soviet people are implementing an extensive economic and cultural development plan. According to the Fifth Five-Year Plan, this year will continue to improve the material and cultural standards of the people, and apply advanced Soviet scientific and technological achievements to expand all sectors of socialist production. The main purpose of the 1953 Soviet State Budget is to guarantee the implementation of the huge plan for developing the national economy, as stipulated by the Soviet government based on the historic resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, and the task of continuing to improve the people's living and cultural standards with the necessary funding.

The budget revenue submitted by the Soviet Council of Ministers for approval is 543.3 billion rubles, and the expenditure is 530.5 billion rubles. The total expenditure of the 1953 State Budget is 70.3 billion rubles more than last year, which is an increase of 15.3 percent. Of the expenditure, 192.5 billion rubles will be used for the national economy, 129.8 billion rubles for social and cultural undertakings, 110.2 billion rubles for national defense, and 14.3 billion rubles for the expenses of state administrative organs. These figures show that the vast majority of state budget funds are used for the national economy and for meeting social and cultural needs. This is only possible under the socialist system, because the socialist system aims to maximize the satisfaction of the growing material and cultural needs of the entire society.

Budget allocations for the national economy are 13.7 billion rubles more than last year, which is an increase of 7.7 percent. Among the funds allocated in the budget for the development of the national economy (excluding the funds earmarked by the industrial enterprises themselves), 82.6 billion rubles will be used for the development of industry, primarily the development of heavy industry. A significant portion of these funds will be used to build new industrial enterprises and to supply industry with new and improved machinery and equipment. The budget has allocated a large amount of funds to continue to greatly develop the industry producing consumer goods.

The funds used for the development of agriculture and the purchase of agricultural products amount to 39.9 billion rubles.

Zverev then spoke about the increase in allocations for education, health, and social insurance. This year, the Soviet State Budget allocated 7 billion rubles more for these areas than in 1952. Among them, the allocation for education is 62.1 billion rubles, the allocation for health and sports is 24.8 billion rubles, and the allocation for social insurance and state subsidies for mothers with many children and single mothers is 42.9 billion rubles.

The government has set the further improvement of residents' living conditions as its task and stipulated that the budget allocation for state housing construction will be increased by 25 percent compared with last year.

Speaking of defense expenditures, Zverev said: The Soviet Union, which has consistently pursued a policy of peace and international cooperation, has decided to take the necessary measures to ensure national security, considering the new threats of aggression from the enemies of peace. The 110.2 billion rubles of defense allocations stipulated in the 1953 Soviet State Budget can ensure that our heroic armed forces continue to be improved and further greatly consolidate our national defense.

Speaking of budget revenues, Zverev said that compared with last year, the revenue from socialist agriculture has increased, while the revenue from the people has decreased. The revenue from the turnover tax of state-owned and cooperative enterprises and institutions is estimated to be 240.4 billion rubles, and the revenue from profit deductions is estimated to be 80.6 billion rubles. The revenue from the residents' subscription to national bonds is set at 16.7 billion rubles, which is 19.6 billion rubles less than last year. This year, residents will receive 9.8 billion rubles in bond lottery bonuses and bond redemptions, which is almost 3 billion rubles more than last year.

Due to the further improvement of the welfare of the Soviet people, it is estimated that residents' savings will increase by 10 billion rubles in 1953. By the end of 1953, the total deposits in savings banks will reach more than 36 billion rubles, which is about five times the pre-war level.

This year, the revenue from taxes paid by the people stipulated in the budget is 46.1 billion rubles.

Zverev pointed out that the Soviet government, while presenting the budget proposal, also submitted a bill on agricultural tax for collective farmers and other people engaged in agriculture for consideration by the Soviet Supreme Soviet. This bill stipulates a significant reduction in agricultural tax. The total amount of agricultural tax in 1953 will be reduced by 4.137 billion rubles compared with 1952, a reduction of 43 percent, and next year, the amount of this tax will be reduced by more than 60 percent. The government also decided that all outstanding agricultural taxes from the past few years will be waived.

Zverev emphasized that the Soviet state constantly pays attention to the economic and cultural development of the people of the various union republics and autonomous republics. The budgets of the various republics vividly reflect this, with their revenues and expenditures increasing year by year. Under the total Soviet state budget, the budget of the various union republics in 1953 will reach 102.6 billion rubles. The budgets of the various union republics will increase by 4.8 billion rubles compared with last year, which is an increase of 4.9 percent.

Zverev then spoke about the tasks of various ministries and departments in increasing internal capital accumulation and implementing the strictest economy.

Zverev concluded by saying: The 1953 Soviet State Budget is a budget for further consolidating the strength of the Soviet Union. It guarantees the necessary funds for the further vigorous development of the socialist economy and the improvement of the material and cultural standards of the Soviet people.

After Zverev's report, the joint session of the two houses adjourned. The Nationalities Council will hold a meeting at 11:00 AM on the 6th, and the Union Council will hold a meeting at 6:00 PM on the 6th.

    苏联最高苏维埃联盟院民族院开联席会议
    苏联财政部部长报告国家预算
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院，在五日下午七时举行联席会议，听取苏联财政部部长阿·兹维列夫所作关于一九五三年苏联国家预算和关于一九五一年与一九五二年预算执行情况的报告。
    当苏联共产党和政府领袖格·马·马林科夫、维·米·莫洛托夫、尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫、克·叶·伏罗希洛夫、尼·亚·布尔加宁、拉·莫·卡冈诺维奇、阿·伊·米高扬、马·扎·萨布罗夫和米·格·别尔乌辛在政府席上出现时，全体代表和来宾起立，热烈鼓掌。
    苏联财政部部长阿·兹维列夫在报告中强调指出，在第五个五年计划付诸实施以来的两年半中，苏联人民在发展工业、农业和运输业、在进一步提高人民的生活水平、公共卫生事业及文化发展方面获得了新的重大成就。苏联国民经济的扩大，为胜利执行苏联国家预算创造了条件。预算执行的情况如下：一九五一年——收入四千七百零三亿卢布，支出四千四百三十亿卢布；一九五二年——收入四千九百七十七亿卢布，支出四千六百零二亿卢布。一九五二年国民经济和满足人民文化和社会需要的预算支出占总预算支出的大部分，达三千零一十六亿卢布，而在战前一九四○年，这种预算支出是九百九十亿卢布，这就是说，增加了两倍多。
    兹维列夫谈到一九五三年苏联国家预算时说，苏联人民正在实施广泛的经济和文化发展计划。根据第五个五年计划，今年要继续提高人民的物质和文化水平，应用先进的苏维埃科学和技术成就，以扩大社会主义生产的一切部门。一九五三年苏联国家预算的主要目的，就是以必要的经费来保证实施苏联政府根据苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的历史性的决议为今年规定的巨大的发展国民经济的计划，以及继续提高人民的生活与文化水平的任务。
    苏联部长会议提请批准的预算收入是五千四百三十三亿卢布，支出是五千三百零五亿卢布。一九五三年国家预算总支出比去年多七百零三亿卢布，也就是增加百分之十五点三。支出中有一千九百二十五亿卢布用在国民经济方面，一千二百九十八亿卢布用在社会和文化事业方面，一千一百零二亿卢布用在国防方面，一百四十三亿卢布用作国家行政机关的经费。这些数字表明，国家预算经费中的绝大部分是用在国民经济和满足社会和文化需要方面的。只有在社会主义制度下才有可能这样做，因为社会主义制度是旨在最大限度地满足整个社会增长的物质和文化需要的。
    国民经济方面的预算拨款比去年多一百三十七亿卢布，也就是增加百分之七点七。在预算拨作发展国民经济之用的款项（不包括各工业企业自己指拨的经费）中，有八百二十六亿卢布将用在发展工业首先是发展重工业上。其中有颇大一部分经费将用来建筑新的工业企业并以新的、经过改良的机器和设备供应工业。预算拨出了大笔经费来继续大大发展生产消费品的工业。
    用于发展农业和采购农产品的经费有三百九十九亿卢布。
    兹维列夫接着谈到教育、卫生、社会保险方面拨款的增加情况。今年苏联国家预算中拨作这方面的款项比一九五二年多七十亿卢布。其中教育方面的拨款为六百二十一亿卢布，卫生和体育方面的拨款为二百四十八亿卢布，社会保险和国家对于子女众多的母亲和单身母亲的津贴的拨款为四百二十九亿卢布。
    政府把进一步改善居民居住状况定为自己的任务，规定把国家房屋建筑的预算拨款比去年增加百分之二十五。
    兹维列夫在谈到国防经费时说：一贯遵循和平与国际合作政策的苏联，考虑到和平敌人方面的新的侵略的威胁，决定采取保证国家安全的必要措施。苏联一九五三年国家预算所规定的一千一百零二亿卢布的国防拨款，可以保证我们英勇的武装部队继续得到改进，并进一步大大巩固我们的国防。
    兹维列夫在谈到预算的收入时说，今年和去年比较，从社会主义农业方面的收入增加了，同时从人民方面的收入降低了。来自国营和合作社的企业和机构的周转税的收入预定为二千四百零四亿卢布，从利润提成方面的收入预定为八百零六亿卢布。居民认购的国家公债的收入定为一百六十七亿卢布，这比去年少一百九十六亿卢布。今年，居民将得到九十八亿卢布的公债抽签奖金和公债还本，这差不多比去年多三十亿卢布。
    由于苏联人民福利的进一步增进，估计居民的存款在一九五三年将增加一百亿卢布。到一九五三年年底，储蓄银行的总存款将达三百六十多亿卢布，约为战前的五倍。
    今年，预算规定的由人民纳税所得的收入是四百六十一亿卢布。
    兹维列夫指出，苏联政府在提出预算案的同时，并将一项关于集体农民和其他从事农业的人民所付的农业税法案提交苏联最高苏维埃审议。这个法案规定大大减少农业税。一九五三年的农业税总额将比一九五二年减少四十一亿三千七百万卢布，即减少百分之四十三，而明年，这项税收数额将减少百分之六十以上。政府并决定，过去几年中没有付清的农业税尾数一律免缴。
    兹维列夫着重指出，苏维埃国家经常注意各加盟共和国和自治共和国的人民的经济和文化的发展。各共和国的预算生动地反映出了这一点，它们的收入和支出一年比一年增加，在苏联国家总预算下，各加盟共和国一九五三年的预算将达一千零二十六亿卢布。各加盟共和国的预算将比去年增加四十八亿卢布，即增加百分之四点九。
    兹维列夫接着谈到各部、各处在增加内部资金积累和实行最严格的节约方面的任务。
    兹维列夫最后说：苏联一九五三年国家预算是进一步巩固苏联力量的预算。它保证着社会主义经济的进一步的有力发展和苏维埃人民物质和文化水平的提高所必需的经费。
    兹维列夫报告结束后，两院联席会议就宣告休会。民族院将在六日上午十一时举行会议，联盟院将在六日下午六时开会。
