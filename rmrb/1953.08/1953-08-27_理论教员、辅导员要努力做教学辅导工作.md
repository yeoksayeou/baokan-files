Column: Commentary on Cadre Study

    Editor's Note: "Commentary on Cadre Study" will now be published irregularly but as frequently as possible. Its purpose is to promote the theoretical education of cadres and to solve general work problems that arise in teaching in a timely manner.

    Cultivating and training theoretical instructors and counselors is an important aspect of strengthening the guidance of cadres' theoretical study. In the past, the lack of theoretical instructors and counselors, their low quality, and the weakness of study guidance were among the main difficulties in carrying out cadre theoretical education in various regions. According to incomplete statistics at the end of 1952, there were only 9,384 theoretical instructors nationwide (of whom 542 were full-time instructors, and the rest were part-time). However, when studying Comrade Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and the documents of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the number of participants across the country was approximately over 1.2 million. It is clear that the original small number of theoretical instructors could not meet the needs of this learning army. The problem of the original theoretical instructors and counselors being of low quality (and the vast majority were instructors for elementary groups), and not being able to take on the task of guiding study well, was even more serious.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in its instructions on cadre theoretical education for 1953-1954: "In order to enable theoretical study and policy study of cadres at all levels to be carried out with guidance, it is necessary to focus on solving the problem of theoretical instructors." In recent months, Party committees above the provincial and municipal levels have mostly followed the central instructions and held short-term training courses for theoretical instructors and counselors. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 10,000 full-time and part-time theoretical instructors and counselors for intermediate and elementary groups have now been trained across the country. This has greatly strengthened the forces guiding study and created favorable conditions for carrying out cadre theoretical study in the future.

    Currently, all regions of the country are beginning to study the theory of socialist economic construction one after another. A large number of newly trained theoretical instructors and counselors have either already begun their work or are about to begin. At the same time, according to reports from various regions, some of the newly trained theoretical instructors and counselors have achieved some initial results and have been welcomed by the students due to their active study and hard work in teaching and tutoring. However, on the other hand, some theoretical instructors and counselors appear timid before starting work and are afraid to carry out teaching and tutoring; some have encountered some difficulties in their work and cannot meet the requirements of the students, thus becoming even less confident. Therefore, how to enable theoretical instructors and counselors to do a good job of teaching and tutoring, to help the broad masses of cadres in intermediate and elementary groups to carry out theoretical study, has become a very important issue at present.

    How can this problem be solved? According to the current needs and possible conditions, this first requires theoretical instructors to prepare lessons carefully. Comrades who serve as theoretical instructors must fully recognize the importance of this work, regard teaching as a glorious task, establish a correct attitude, give play to a high degree of enthusiasm, and consciously study hard and prepare lessons carefully. Only by carefully preparing lessons, truly digesting the content of the subject, grasping the core, then reading some necessary reference materials, and integrating them with the topic, can we explain correctly. If we ourselves have not yet understood the content of the document, cannot comprehend its essence, or are not fully prepared and cannot grasp the core, we will certainly not be able to explain correctly when lecturing, and students will certainly feel "unsatisfied" and dissatisfied. Of course, it is a fact that one feels one's theoretical level is not high and one has "little capital"; but comparatively speaking, one has after all learned one step ahead and learned more, and as long as one continues to study hard and prepare lessons carefully, one can always teach. At the same time, "learning while teaching" and "teaching and learning promote each other" will surely gradually improve the theoretical level. Currently, some of the shortcomings of theoretical instructors' lectures are that they either recite according to the outline without explanation, or the explanation is not deep or thorough enough, and some even make irresponsible remarks and explain incorrectly; some either only talk about the book and do not relate to reality, or the connection is not appropriate, and some even take things out of context and make random connections. Therefore, the teaching effect is not good, and there are many students' opinions. This is all because of insufficient preparation and understanding. There is no other way to overcome this shortcoming except to prepare lessons carefully.

    Theoretical instructors must also study teaching methods. The quality of teaching methods has a great impact on the learning effect. Now some comrades also prepare lessons carefully and explain correctly, but due to shortcomings in teaching methods, lecturing is always dry and boring, like a lullaby, making listeners drowsy, which cannot achieve the due effect. In order to change this situation, theoretical instructors should pay attention to studying teaching methods. Everyone should not fight alone, but should often observe each other, exchange teaching experience, and humbly listen to the opinions of students, and constantly improve teaching methods to enhance the effect of teaching. Of course, we cannot demand too much of theoretical instructors. Generally speaking, as long as everyone can make a brief explanation of the content of each chapter before lecturing, and then explain according to the outline, grasp the key points in the explanation, distinguish between major and minor issues, pay attention to the allocation of time, strive for simple and vivid language, choose some examples as much as possible to clarify when necessary, and appropriately relate to China's actual problems; and then summarize in general after lecturing each chapter to give students a clear concept. This will be more satisfactory to the students.

    Study counselors occupy a very important position in study guidance. They should become the bridge between "teaching" and "learning". On the one hand, they should help theoretical instructors prepare lessons and become powerful assistants to theoretical instructors; on the other hand, they should help students learn and become the "leaders" and "little teachers" of the students. The tasks of counselors are: to help theoretical instructors and students collect learning materials, to reflect the students' opinions to the theoretical instructors, to answer some difficult questions, to guide learning methods, to disseminate learning experience, and to solve some ideological problems in learning, etc. In order to do these tasks well and complete the glorious tasks given by the Party, in addition to studying hard oneself and becoming an active member in learning, one should also maintain close contact with theoretical instructors and students, give play to the due bridge role, actively study business, and do a good job of counseling. Now some counselor comrades feel that taking on this work is a burden, and have not actively taken responsibility, so the role played is not great, and this situation should be changed.

    In order to do a good job of teaching and tutoring, theoretical instructors and counselors must, in addition to their own active efforts, also rely closely on the Party committee and rely on the students. Whether it is the content of the lecture, the teaching methods, or the counseling work, if there are difficult problems, as long as the Party committee is asked to help solve them, and more consultation with the students, a proper solution can generally be obtained. At the same time, Party committees at all levels should pay attention to the regular leadership and assistance to theoretical instructors and counselors, such as giving them enough time to prepare lessons, helping them to prepare lessons, reviewing lecture outlines, and organizing teaching research meetings to exchange experience, etc. Currently, in some units in some areas, students have adopted an attitude of not giving friendly help to the instructors' lectures, but adopting an attitude of "picking faults" and "nitpicking", making the instructors feel even less confident. Therefore, in addition to helping instructors improve the quality of teaching, the Party committee should persuade and explain to the students, explaining that they should not demand too much of the instructors, but should follow the instructions of the Central Committee, as long as they can study diligently, work hard, give correct explanations of the learning materials, and answer the questions raised by the learners as carefully as possible, they should be encouraged.

    We believe that under the correct leadership of Party committees at all levels, and with the assistance of the broad masses of students, as long as theoretical instructors and counselors give full play to their initiative and creativity, resolutely overcome difficulties, and strive to do a good job of teaching and tutoring, the current state of very weak theoretical learning guidance will gradually change.

### 理论教员、辅导员要努力做教学辅导工作

    理论教员、辅导员要努力做教学辅导工作
    编者按：“干部学习述评”从现在开始不定期地力求经常发表。其目的在于推动干部理论教育工作，及时解决在教学中所发生的一般工作问题。
    培养和训练理论教员、辅导员，是加强干部理论学习指导的重要环节。过去理论教员、辅导员的缺少和质量不高，学习指导力量薄弱，是各地进行干部理论教育的主要困难之一。根据一九五二年底不完全的统计，全国各地只有九、三八四名理论教员（其中专职教员五四二人，其余都是兼职教员）。可是全国各地在学习斯大林同志的“苏联社会主义经济问题”和联共
    （布）第十九次代表大会的文件时，参加学习的人数大约在一百二十万以上。由此可见，原有的数量很少的理论教员，是不能满足这支学习大军的需要的。至于原有的理论教员、辅导员质量不高（而且绝大多数都是初级组的教员），还不能很好地负担起指导学习的任务，这个问题就更加严重了。
    中共中央关于一九五三—一九五四年干部理论教育的指示中指出：“为使各级干部的理论学习和政策学习能够有指导地进行，必须着重解决理论教员问题。”最近数月以来，各省市以上党委，大都遵照中央指示，举办了理论教员和辅导员短期训练班。根据不完全统计，全国各地现已训练出近万名中级组和初级组的专职和兼职的理论教员和辅导员。这就大大增强了指导学习的力量，为开展今后的干部理论学习创造了有利的条件。
    现在，全国各地正在先后开始学习社会主义经济建设理论，新训练出来的大批理论教员和辅导员有的已开始进行工作，有的即将开始工作。同时根据各地反映，新训练出来的理论教员和辅导员在进行教学辅导工作时，有些由于积极钻研，努力工作，已经获得一些初步成绩，受到了学员们的欢迎。但另一方面，还有些理论教员和辅导员，在工作之前表现胆怯，不敢进行教学辅导工作；有些在工作中遭遇了一些困难，不能满足学员的要求，因而愈加信心不足。因此，怎样使理论教员和辅导员做好教学辅导工作，去帮助中级组和初级组的广大干部进行理论学习，就成为目前一个十分重要的问题。
    这个问题怎样解决呢？按照目前的需要和可能的条件来说，这首先要使理论教员认真备课。担任理论教员的同志，要充分认识这一工作的重要性，把教学工作当作一件光荣的任务，树立正确的态度，发挥高度的积极性，自觉地钻研，认真备课。只有认真备课，真正地消化了课目的内容，掌握住中心，然后阅读一些必要的参考材料，并把它们和课题融会起来，才能做到讲解正确。如果自己还未弄通文件的内容，不能领会其精神实质，或者准备不充分，掌握不住中心，在讲课时就一定不能讲解正确，学员一定感到“不解渴”、不满意。当然，自己感到理论水平不高，“本钱少”，这是事实；但比较起来，毕竟还是先学一步和多学了一些，只要继续努力钻研，认真备课，总是可以教课的。同时“边教边学”，“教学相长”，又一定会使理论水平逐步提高。目前有些理论教员讲课的缺点，不是按提纲背诵，不加解释，就是解释得不深不透，有的甚至是信口开河，解释错误；有些不是光讲书本，不联系实际，就是联系得不恰当，有的甚至是顺手牵羊，胡乱联系。因此，教学效果不好，学员意见很多。这都是因为准备不充分、理解不深刻的缘故。要克服这种缺点，除了认真备课以外，没有别的办法。
    理论教员还必须研究教学方法。教学方法的好坏，影响学习效果很大。现在有些同志虽然也认真备课，讲解也还正确，但是由于教学方法有缺点，讲起课来总是枯燥无味，如同催眠，使听者昏昏欲睡，这就不能达到应有的效果。为了改变这种情况，理论教员要注意研究教学方法。大家不要孤军作战，要经常互相观摩，交流教学经验，并虚心听取学员的意见，不断改进教学方法，以增强教学的效果。当然，我们不能对理论教员要求过高，一般的说，只要大家能在讲授之前，把学习每章的内容作一扼要地说明，进而根据提纲讲解，在讲解中能抓着重点，分清主要和次要的问题，注意时间的支配，语言力求通俗生动一些，必要时尽可能选择一些实例加以阐明，并适当地联系中国的实际问题；在讲完每章之后再概括地加以总结，使学员有一个明确的概念。这样学员将会比较满意。
    学习辅导员在学习指导中占很重要的地位。他们应当成为“教”与“学”的桥梁。他们一方面要帮助理论教员备课，成为理论教员的有力助手；另一方面要帮助学员学习，成为学员的“带头人”和“小先生”。辅导员的任务是：帮助理论教员和学员搜集学习资料，向理论教员反映学员的意见，解答部分的疑难问题，指导学习方法，传播学习经验和解决学习中的一些思想问题等等。辅导员要做好这些工作，完成党所给予的光荣任务，除了本人应努力学习，成为学习中的积极分子以外，还应当同理论教员和学员保持密切的联系，发挥其应有的桥梁作用，积极钻研业务，做好辅导工作。现在有些辅导员同志，感到担任这个工作是一种负担，而没有积极地负起责任来，所起的作用不大，这种情况是应当改变的。
    理论教员和辅导员要想做好教学辅导工作，除了本身的积极努力之外，还要紧紧地依靠党委，依靠学员。不论是讲课内容、教学方法和辅导工作，遇有困难问题，只要请求党委帮助解决，并多和学员商量，大致是可以得到适当解决的。同时各级党委要对理论教员、辅导员注意经常的领导和帮助，如给予他们以足够的备课时间，帮助他们进行备课，审查讲授提纲，组织教学研究会交流经验等等。目前有些地区的若干单位，曾发生学员对教员讲课不采取善意帮助的态度，而采取“挑眼找岔”、“吹毛求疵”的态度，使教员更加感到信心不足。因此，党委除应帮助教员提高教课质量以外，应对学员进行说服解释，说明对教员不应要求过高，而是应当按照中央所指示的，只要他们能够用功学习，努力工作，对学习材料能够作正确讲解，对学习者提出的问题能够尽其所能谨慎地解答，就应该予以鼓励。
    我们相信，在各级党委的正确领导下，在广大学员的协助下，只要理论教员、辅导员充分地发挥积极性和创造性，坚决克服困难，努力做好教学辅导工作，将会逐渐改变目前理论学习指导十分薄弱的状态。
