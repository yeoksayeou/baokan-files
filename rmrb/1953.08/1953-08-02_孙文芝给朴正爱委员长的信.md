    Sun Wenzhi's Letter to Chairman Park Jeong-ae
    Editor's Note: Park Jeong-ae, Chairman of the Korean War Disaster Relief Committee, wrote a letter on June 9th to Sun Wenzhi, a mother in China, expressing gratitude for Sun Wenzhi's donation of 12 million RMB to Korean War orphans. Below is Sun Wenzhi's reply letter to Chairman Park Jeong-ae.
    Dear Chairman Park Jeong-ae:
    I have read your letter again and again, and I have picked up my pen countless times to write back to you, but I really cannot express the glory I feel.
    Of course, I deeply understand that the glory you have given me should be attributed to the great and wise Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who have educated and nurtured us over the years, and should be attributed to all Chinese women, especially to those Chinese mothers who have sacrificed their outstanding children to fight against the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people—the American invaders.
    Comrade Chairman, whenever I see the happy children of our motherland going to school with their schoolbags on their backs, I cannot help but think of the newsreel I saw at the International Conference for the Defense of Children held in Vienna in 1952. Your just appeal to the people of the world at the conference deeply moved me, and I felt boundless anger and hatred for the American invaders' insane slaughter of Korean children. Comrade Chairman, your righteous call has resonated from the bottom of the hearts of every mother who loves peace and loves children.
    How proud I am to be engaged in the just struggle of defending peace and defending children together! Not long ago, I received letters from Comrade Zheng Tieji, a soldier of the Korean People's Army, Comrade Cui Jifu, a Korean soldier recuperating, and Comrade Jin Guixiu and other eight Korean young workers who came to the Shanghai Textile Machinery Factory to study. They wrote in not-so-proficient Chinese, and even wrote Korean when writing Chinese characters, but it did not hinder them from expressing what they wanted to say. The noble friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, which has grown out of combat, is indeed unbreakable.
    In the past two months, I have also received more than a hundred letters from Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers from the Korean front. Two of the soldiers told me in their second letters that they had gloriously earned international merits in the just battle. Countless facts have shown that the blood of the Chinese and Korean people is flowing together in the just struggle to defend peace and oppose aggression.
    In the letters from two other soldiers, they also sent me bookmarks made from the so-called "nylon bulletproof vests" worn by captured American soldiers as souvenirs. They told me the shameful and ridiculous story of how the American bandits used "nylon bulletproof vests" made of twelve layers of asbestos to deceive their soldiers.
    The hatred and contempt for American imperialism and the love for the Korean people and Korean children expressed in the letters of our heroic soldiers are enough to show that our cause is just, the strength of the Chinese and Korean people is invincible, and our cause of defending peace is bound to win.
    Comrade Chairman, I am very excited to know that the descendants of the heroic nation—the future masters of Korea—are growing up healthily under the deep care of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic government, and the beloved Marshal Kim Il-sung. They are the pride of mankind, and we will always educate our own children with the example of their heroic parents and their own struggle life.
    Let us fight more bravely to defend peace and defend children!
    With the most sincere respect,
    Sun Wenzhi, July 20th

    孙文芝给朴正爱委员长的信
    编者按：朝鲜战争灾民救济委员会委员长朴正爱曾在六月九日写信给我国的一位母亲孙文芝，对孙文芝以人民币一千二百万元捐赠给朝鲜战争孤儿的义举表示感谢。下面是孙文芝给朴正爱委员长的复信。亲爱的朴正爱委员长：
    我一次又一次地读着您的来信，我多少次地提起笔来想给您写回信，但是，我实在无法表达我所感到的光荣。
    当然，我深刻地理解到您给予我的光荣，是应该归于这些年来教育与抚育我们的伟大的英明的毛主席与共产党的，是应该归于全中国妇女的，特别是归于那些为了打击中朝人民的共同敌人——美国侵略者而献出自己优秀的儿女的中国母亲们的。
    委员长同志，每当我看到我们祖国幸福的儿童背着书包去上学校，我就不能不想起我曾经看到的一九五二年在维也纳召开的国际保卫儿童大会的新闻影片。您在大会上向全世界人民发出的正义号召，曾使我深深感动，而对美国侵略者疯狂地残杀朝鲜儿童，感到无比的愤怒与仇恨。委员长同志，您的正义的号召已引起了每一个热爱和平，热爱孩子的母亲们从心底里发出了共鸣。
    我是多么地为我们共同从事的保卫和平，保卫孩子的正义斗争而引以为骄傲呀！不久前，我曾经收到了一位朝鲜人民军战士郑铁甲同志、在休养中的朝鲜战士崔吉福同志以及来上海纺织机械厂学习的八位朝鲜青年工人金贵秀等同志的来信，他们在信中写着不大熟练的中国字，甚至在写出中国字的时候写了朝鲜文，但却丝毫也没有妨害他们所要表达的意思，中朝人民从战斗中成长起来的崇高友谊，确实是牢不可破的。
    两个月来，我还收到了一百多封来自朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军战士的来信，其中有两个战士在第二次来信中告诉我，他们已经在正义的战斗中光荣地立下了国际战功。千千万万事实说明了：在保卫和平，反对侵略的正义斗争中，中朝人民的鲜血是流在一起的。
    在另外两位战士的来信中，他们还把用缴获来的美国士兵穿的所谓“尼龙避弹衣”做成的书签送给我作为纪念。他们告诉我，关于美国强盗用十二层石棉做成的“尼龙避弹衣”，用来欺骗他们士兵的可耻而又可笑的故事。
    从我们英勇的战士们的来信中所表示的对美帝国主义的仇恨与鄙视，以及对朝鲜人民、朝鲜孩子的热爱，都足以说明我们的事业是正义的，中朝人民的力量是不可战胜的，我们保卫和平的事业是必胜的。
    委员长同志，我非常兴奋地知道英雄民族的后代——朝鲜未来的主人翁在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和敬爱的金日成元帅的深切关怀下，正在健全的成长着，他们是人类的骄傲，我们将时刻以他们英雄父母的榜样与他们自己的斗争生活来教育我自己的孩子们。
    让我们为保卫和平，保卫孩子更英勇地奋斗吧！
    敬向你致最崇高的敬礼
    孙文芝七月二十日
