    Iran's New Government Formed
    Zahedi Arrests Progressives on a Large Scale
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 26th] Tehran News: General Zahedi, who led the military coup in Iran on the 19th and overthrew the Mossadegh government, has formed a new government. Zahedi was secretly appointed Prime Minister by the Iranian King before the coup. Most ministers have been appointed, with Zahedi concurrently serving as Minister of Interior and Minister of Army.
    After Zahedi came to power, the Iranian ambassadors to the United States, France, Belgium, and other countries, as well as the Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, have resigned.
    The Zahedi government is arresting progressives on a large scale. On the 23rd, the Zahedi government arrested Mahmoud Hommos, a famous Iranian peace fighter and member of the World Peace Council. At the same time, large-scale arrests are also being carried out in various provinces of Iran. In Senderjiang, a small city with a population of only 10,000 in Azerbaijan Province, 75 people have been arrested.
    Conflicts have occurred between Mossadegh's supporters and the King's supporters in cities such as Kirman, Leicester, and Hamadan. The Kashkai tribe, who support Mossadegh, occupied the police barracks in Simalun, central Iran.
    Zahedi attempted to convene a meeting of former Senate members on the 22nd, using the previously dissolved Senate. Many senators opposed this action. They pointed out that the Senate had been dissolved in accordance with legal parliamentary voting procedures, and the King had issued an order approving this resolution. An article published in the Tehran "Witness" newspaper on the 24th stated that the former senators were attempting to take advantage of the domestic situation to continue their activities, which was illegal.

    伊朗新政府组成
    萨希迪大规模逮捕进步分子
    【新华社二十六日讯】德黑兰消息：在十九日领导伊朗军事政变而推翻了摩萨台政府的萨希迪将军已经组成了新政府。萨希迪在政变之前由伊朗国王秘密任命为首相。大部分大臣都已任命，萨希迪兼任内政大臣和陆军大臣。
    在萨希迪上台后，伊朗驻美、法、比等国大使和驻意大利临时代办都已辞职。
    萨希迪政府正大肆逮捕进步分子。二十三日，萨希迪政府逮捕了伊朗著名和平战士、世界和平理事会理事马茂德·霍摩斯。同时，在伊朗全国各省也正在进行大规模逮捕。在阿塞拜疆省一个只有一万人口的小城市森德疆，就已有七十五人被捕。
    摩萨台的拥护者和国王拥护者之间在基尔曼、莱斯特、哈马丹等城市先后发生了冲突。支持摩萨台的卡士海族占领了伊朗中部西马伦的警察营房。
    萨希迪企图利用已经解散了的前上院，在二十二日召开了上院议员会议。许多议员都对这个行动表示反对。他们指出：上院已经按照议会投票的合法手续解散了，而且还曾经国王颁布命令赞同这个决议。德黑兰“见证报”二十四日刊载的一篇文章说，前上院议员企图利用国内的情况，继续进行自己的活动，这种活动是非法的。
