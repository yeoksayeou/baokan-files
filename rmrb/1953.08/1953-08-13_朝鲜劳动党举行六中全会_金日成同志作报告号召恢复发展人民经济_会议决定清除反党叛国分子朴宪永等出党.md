Comrade Park Jeong-ae emphasized: In the future, we must further enhance revolutionary vigilance. In order to further strengthen the Party organizationally and ideologically, Party organizations at all levels must work responsibly, promote inner-Party democracy and criticism and self-criticism to the level required by the Party, the highest principle of Party leadership—the collective leadership method—and further strengthen Marxist-Leninist education so as to strive for new victories in the struggle to implement the arduous tasks put forward by Comrade Kim Il-sung.

Finally, the meeting discussed organizational issues and adopted corresponding decisions.
