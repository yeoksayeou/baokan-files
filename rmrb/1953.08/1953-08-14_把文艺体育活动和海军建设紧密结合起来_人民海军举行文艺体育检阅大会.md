Xinhua News Agency Report: The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy's first Literary and Sports Review Conference, which began on August 1st in Qingdao, successfully concluded on the 11th. Participating in this conference were more than 1,700 people from six naval units across the country, including literary and artistic representative teams (including soldier representative teams) and sports representative teams. Xiao Jingguang, Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, Deputy Commander Wang Hongkun, and Deputy Political Commissar Liu Daosheng all attended the opening ceremony of the conference. This conference reviewed the achievements of the Chinese People's Navy in literary and sports activities since its establishment, summarized and exchanged experiences, and achieved great gains, laying the foundation for further developing the army's combat-oriented and mass-based literary and sports activities in the future.

Liu Daosheng, Deputy Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, pointed out the significance of the conference in his speech at the opening ceremony. He said: Sports are even more important for the Navy. We live on the ocean, fight on the ocean, and bear the important task of eliminating enemies invading from the sea and defending the motherland's coast. We must not only have skilled driving and shooting techniques, but also have the perseverance and courage to overcome strong winds and waves. Therefore, widely开展体育运动 has become an indispensable part of our daily life. He went on to point out: Literary life is also an important part of our naval forces' life. On ships, on islands, and during ocean voyages, we need to use rich and vivid literary and artistic activities to beautify our lives and promote our revolutionary optimistic spirit. Finally, he called on all literary and artistic workers and athletes present to actively disseminate the experiences and achievements of the conference, implement the spirit of the conference among the masses, and further improve the army's literary and sports activities on the existing foundation, so that every soldier has a strong physique and high cultural literacy, in order to better serve the motherland's national defense construction.

The conference held a total of 64 various sports competition events, of which ten achieved scores that broke the 1952 national records. For example, Lin Guang, squad leader of a certain company, won three championships in the 200-meter breaststroke, armed swimming, and armed landing, among which the 200-meter breaststroke broke the 1952 national record. Also breaking the 1952 national records were: middle-heavyweight weightlifting, 800-meter race, women's 50-meter swimming, women's 100-meter backstroke, women's 400-meter swimming, men's 100-meter butterfly, men's 400-meter freestyle, men's 50-meter underwater swimming, and men's 300-meter medley relay. In addition, Jiang Yicheng, a contestant from East China in the mast climbing competition, completed the 12-meter high mast with 33 horizontal ladders in just 12.5 seconds. His swift movements and skilled techniques won enthusiastic cheers from the audience. Competitions and demonstration matches in six-person sampan, water polo, and diving were also unanimously praised by the audience. Various water sports competitions were carried out in a tense and enthusiastic atmosphere, and the strong physical strength and skillful techniques of the water athletes fully demonstrated the naval soldiers' love for the ocean, their determination to conquer the ocean, and their fighting will and strength to defend the motherland's territorial waters.

In the literary and artistic performance programs, a total of 45 dance, music, drama, and ballad programs won performance awards and creation awards. Among them, 25 awards were won by the soldier literary and artistic representative teams from various units. The soldier representative team's "Coastal Artillery in Song" and Shandong Kuaishu "Zhang Wenxiang Advises His Mother", as well as the dance "Happy Island", won first prizes for creation and performance.

Most of the outstanding athletes and performers who emerged in the sports and literary competitions were sailors from ships and islands, commanders and combatants from ground forces. A unit that won the national first-class model health unit in 1952 won the honorary award of the conference for exemplarily abiding by discipline, cherishing the people, paying attention to etiquette, and displaying a high degree of unity and friendship.

The closing ceremony of the conference was held on the afternoon of the 11th. Liu Daosheng, Deputy Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, delivered the closing speech. Winners of various literary and sports competitions received various awards.

    中国人民解放军海军副政委刘道生在大会开幕典礼上讲话，指出了这次大会的意义。他说：体育运动对于海军来说是更加重要的。我们生活在海洋上，战斗在海洋上，要担负着消灭从海上来进犯的敌人，保卫祖国海防的重大任务。我们不但要有熟练的驾驶和射击技术，而且还必须具有战胜大风大浪的毅力与勇气。因此，广泛地开展体育运动成为我们日常生活中不可缺少的内容。他接着指出：文艺生活也是我们海军部队的重要生活内容。在舰艇上、海岛上，在海洋航行中，都需要用丰富生动的文艺活动来美化自己的生活，来发扬我们革命的乐观主义的精神。最后他号召到会的全体文艺工作者、运动员，积极传播大会的经验和成就，把大会的精神贯彻到群众中去，使全军文艺体育运动在原有的基础上更提高一步，使每一战士都具有坚强的体魄和高度的文化素养，以便更好地为祖国国防建设服务。
    大会共进行了六十四项各种体育竞赛项目，其中有十项成绩打破一九五二年的全国纪录。如某连班长林光获得了二百公尺蛙式游泳、武装游泳及武装登陆等三项冠军，其中二百公尺蛙式游泳一项的成绩打破了一九五二年的全国纪录。打破一九五二年全国纪录的还有：中重级举重、八百公尺赛跑、女子五十公尺游泳、女子一百公尺仰泳、女子四百公尺游泳、男子一百公尺蝴蝶式俯泳、男子四百公尺自由式游泳、男子五十公尺潜泳及男子三百公尺混合式接力等八项。此外，爬桅竞赛的华东选手蒋义成仅用了十二秒五便爬完了十二公尺高、有着三十三根横梯的桅杆。他那迅速的动作和熟练的技巧，博得了全场观众的热烈的喝采。六人舢板、水球和跳水等项竞赛和表演赛也受到观众的一致赞扬。各项水上体育竞赛活动始终在紧张热烈的气氛中进行，水上运动员的坚强体力和娴熟的技术，充分地显示出海军战士们热爱海洋、征服海洋和保卫祖国领海的战斗意志和力量。
    在文艺会演节目中，一共有四十五个舞蹈、音乐及戏剧、说唱节目分别获得了演出奖和创作奖。其中有二十五个奖为各部战士文艺代表队所得。战士代表队的“海岸炮兵在歌唱”和山东快书“张文祥劝娘”，以及舞蹈“愉快的岛屿”等节目都获得创作和演出的一等奖。
    在体育和文艺竞赛中涌现的成绩优良的运动员和演员，大部分是舰艇和海岛上的水兵、地面部队的指挥员和战斗员。曾经在一九五二年荣获全国甲等模范卫生单位的一个部队，在这次大会上由于模范地遵守纪律、爱护人民、讲究礼节，并发挥了高度的团结友爱的精神，因此获得了大会的荣誉奖。
    大会在十一日下午举行闭幕典礼。中国人民解放军海军副政治委员刘道生致闭幕词。各项文艺体育竞赛的优胜者分别获得了各种奖励。
