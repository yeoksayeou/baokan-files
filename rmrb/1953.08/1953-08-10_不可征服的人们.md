    The Unconquerable People
    Huang Gang
    Now, the three years of gunfire in Korea have ceased. As the dawn of peace begins to descend upon the cities and villages of Korea, and as Korean parents, siblings go to the graves of martyrs to console their loved ones, I naturally recall those days I spent living among the Korean people. The indelible impressions they left on me now appear even more distinct and strong.

    I will always remember that one night, the continuous singing of Korean children under the moonlight. They were so delighted, singing and dancing incessantly until late at night. This was last year's August 15th, and I spent the anniversary of the Soviet Red Army's liberation of Korea with the farmers in a small village in Ichon County, at the front line in Korea. From this most ordinary village, from the central to the coastal regions of North Korea, from the front lines to the rear, I listened to many voices of the Korean people. Just like in this small village on the 38th parallel, where I heard Korean children singing songs of Korea, the Soviet Union, and China late at night, I will forever remember the vow-like words of those Korean brothers and sisters. They expressed the wishes of peace fighters.

    While accompanying us to visit the Korean People's Army, Korean soldier Kim Deok-bong said to me:

    "Comrade, do you know why my emotions were stirred when I came to Korea? I still remember the scene when I first entered Gusan Town while on a reconnaissance mission. The enemy had just retreated, and it was after a major bombing, so everything was burned and collapsed. I saw Korean compatriots burying corpses in the wind and rain. I approached them. None of them cried. At that moment, I saw many flowers blooming at the foot of the wall next to the ruins of a club. I saw the dead, and I didn't cry, but at that moment, I couldn't stop my tears! I thought to myself: Where is the owner of this house? What about their happy life? You don't know, those flowers were so fresh, so beautiful, I looked at them for a long time. I looked and thought, thought and thought..."

    Kim Deok-bong is twenty-four years old this year. He thought about the entire fate of his homeland, Korea. He thought about the happy future of his country, and also about its tragic past. His grandfather was a patriotic fighter who resisted the Japanese aggressors in Korea more than fifty years ago. Kim Deok-bong was born in China, and now he has returned to Korea. Kim's father was a guerrilla fighter who sacrificed his life in the Northeast Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War. After burying Kim's father, his steadfast mother also died heartbroken beside her husband's grave. His grandfather, who was left behind, repeatedly told Kim Deok-bong: "Child, don't forget your homeland, your homeland Korea, is a beautiful country, where the mountains and rivers are beautiful and magnificent, and flowers bloom everywhere. One day, your country will be liberated, and when you go back, you must first look at the pink rose of Sharon – it is our national flower."

        "I have always remembered my grandfather's words. But I didn't expect that when I returned to Korea, it would be surrounded by ruins, with flowers blooming on these ruins! At that time, I picked a rose of Sharon while crying; I made a wish to myself, saying: 'Korea, my homeland, the land where my parents gave birth to me, I must dedicate my life to you, so that you can surely achieve peace! Restore construction, and let the pink rose of Sharon bloom all over your land.'"

    Soon, in the People's Army camp filled with rose-colored, white, and yellow June chrysanthemums, we heard the speeches of the heroes of the People's Army, thanks to the help of Comrade Kim Deok-bong's translation.

    "Our unit has fought in every river and on every mountain in the motherland, and our soldiers are proud of this." Comrade Kim Young-seok, a writer stationed in a certain unit of the People's Army, said: "When our army chased the enemy south in 1950, we chased them to the Nakdong River. When the enemy retreated, they set fire to the gasoline, and everything was burning. I saw some cattle and horses with fire on their bodies, and groups of cattle and horses were running everywhere with flames...

    "It was among these mad cattle and horses that I saw for the first time the deadly enemy who invaded our land – the American interventionist army holding weapons; I watched them wearing steel helmets, khaki uniforms, high-waisted boots, and holding submachine guns! They appeared among these rampaging cattle and horses, with such savage and terrifying expressions!"

    Writer Kim Young-seok continued: "At that moment, I lay on the hillside, unscrewed the cap of the grenade, and threw it out with the soldiers beside me! I heard those soldiers shouting: 'Hmph, beasts – we won't let you dirty our fields!' From that moment on, I cherished every inch of land, every drop of river water, and every blade of grass beside me more than ever!..."

    I looked at Comrade Kim with great respect – one of his arms was recently injured in an American air raid, and his hand was still bandaged. He spoke to us while strolling in the colorful June chrysanthemum flowers. The June chrysanthemums appeared very bright in the last autumn sun.

    He talked to us about the defensive battles of the autumn of 1952. He said:

    "Of course, the enemy was met with bloody noses in front of our positions, and our entire army became stronger as we fought. Recently, in the battle of Hill 351, we had a seventeen-year-old kid – the signalman Zhao Ji-dai, who shouted to the enemy while holding the isolated position: 'Come on! Come a little closer, come a little closer! Why don't you come?' The enemy didn't dare to come closer. Our kid then shouted: 'First platoon to the left, third platoon straight ahead, second platoon to the right, encircle and advance!' The enemy hesitated even more and was about to retreat. In fact, the comrades-in-arms beside our kid had all sacrificed. Only he was left. He used his wisdom and courage to kill more than sixty enemies on his own."

    Kim Young-seok said: I asked him what courage he had to win this victory?

    Seventeen-year-old Zhao Ji-dai replied: Because the motherland is with me.

    Park Yong-sik, a signalman of the same age as Zhao Ji-dai, also possessed the heroic spirit of the People's Army soldiers. Hill 351 was bombarded by enemy artillery, and the situation was critical. All communication equipment had been damaged. Park Yong-sik was ordered to break through the enemy's heavily sealed fire net and contact the regiment headquarters to request additional ammunition. He crossed countless dangerous areas bombarded by artillery and machine gun fire and ran to the regimental command post, where he was already close to fainting. The regimental political commissar helped him up and said: How about it, can you risk it again and take a staff officer back to the position?

    Park Yong-sik, whose body was already extremely tired and thirsty, replied: Of course.

    The regimental political commissar pointed to the map and said: Go up and tell the outpost on your left to retreat from the top of this mountain. Park Yong-sik thought: What? Retreat? He immediately felt that the strength he had desperately squeezed out of his body suddenly disappeared. He had come out of middle school three months ago, and his mother had sent him to join the army. In his seventeen-year-old mind, there was no such word as "retreat." The regimental political commissar continued to say to him: Transferring this hill is due to tactical requirements: we will retreat slightly behind the hillside in order to attract the enemy to come and eliminate it with pre-determined artillery fire, and the hill will soon return. Hearing this, Park Yong-sik was relieved. He immediately took a full glass of cold water from the staff officer and drank it in one gulp, as if he was using this large glass of beverage to make his mind clearer. Then, he immediately and happily completed the task.

    He – Park Yong-sik was sitting next to us. Speaking of this, the little signalman with the pure red shoulder straps with black lines, the little signalman whose face was tanned black and whose playful curve of lips was tightly retracted like someone usually accustomed to silence lowered his head and rolled up the corner of his military uniform. Our young warrior seemed embarrassed at this time.

    "This is my first battle." After saying this unnaturally, he changed the subject as if he didn't want to talk about his battle anymore. He said: "My school, you see, is right on this beach..." Looking in the direction he pointed, the plane of the ocean stretched out infinitely in front of us. The sea, which appeared light blue, gray-blue, and dark green in the extreme distance in the twilight, rolled in white-laced tides near us. The waves on the sea were rushing. These are unstoppable waves. This is his hometown.

    "...I like our beach." Park Yong-sik said: "Every time I have a geography lesson, I look for it again and again on the large globe. I want to see how long the curve of our ocean occupies on the large globe?" After a while, he added:

    "I had already finished the third grade of junior high school before the summer vacation. My mother said: 'Park Yong-sik, go and block the Americans, and come back after the victory!'"

    We asked him: What are you planning to do after this war?

    "Study." He replied: "I haven't studied enough." When Park Yong-sik said this, he also picked up a maple leaf. There are really many maple trees here.

    "What subjects do you like in school?"

    "The most favorite: is Russian."

    "What else?"

    "Biology." He looked at the maple leaf in his hand and answered quickly and clearly, as if the veins on that dark red maple leaf had some inspiration for him.

    When we left this camp, he sent us a long way along the beach. Finally, we all watched carefully as he carried his new rifle, passed through the fields cultivated by his parents, and returned to his company.

    Our car passed this beach. This is indeed a beautiful place. The soft chest of the near-ripe grassy green rice fields undulated charmingly in the evening sea breeze. The dark green pine forest passed, and the ochre-black cliffs passed. Soon after, we came to the noisy threshing ground in the rural area behind the Korean lines. Here, the girls wearing long skirts took turns stepping on the threshing machine. The bountiful autumn harvest has arrived.

    Next to the threshing machine in the Old Kang family, a family of revolutionary martyrs, in Bonghak Village, Yongdam Township, Anju County, I saw Kang Man-ok, the little granddaughter of the Kang family. She was wearing a black naval uniform. After helping her family thresh rice, she was concentrating on reviewing her middle school Russian lessons.

    Threshing in the field, going to school, quiet nights, bright lights – it's not easy to get these in wartime Korea! This is inseparable from the heroic battles of Park Yong-sik, Zhao Ji-dai, and Kim Deok-bong, and also inseparable from the struggle and sacrifice of every family. Take the Kang family as an example: Kang Man-ok's father – a railway worker before liberation, an agricultural innovator after liberation, a member of the Labor Party, and an active builder of the motherland – was tortured to death in an American prison. Kang Man-ok's uncle – the militia captain of the district government, fought many beautiful battles in guerrilla activities, and was later captured by the American interventionist army and shot in the square. The old mother cried on her son's body and said: "Son! What a good son! You shouldn't have died, it's like you haven't died, I will avenge you!"

    In the past, how many nights, in strong winds and heavy snow, the mother would personally wait for her son to return! But now, the son will never return; he will never be like in the past, when he went to the district to take care of the construction of the dam, and when the rooster crowed, the eldest son would drag his tired body back. Never again will every guerrilla fighter be able to hear the second son's clear, humorous analysis and enthusiastic mobilization voice. Now, the younger sister is inheriting the elder and second elder brothers, in the rice fields, under the bombing, leading the members of the Democratic Youth League, as a strong assistant to the Labor Party branch, building dams day and night. Now, the daughter Kang Man-ok is inheriting her father, skillfully registering the harvest in the threshing ground, and loudly reading the newspaper at the meeting. Despite this, the mother who lost her sons still harbors the flames of revenge in her heart and still misses her sons. She often runs to the Cheongcheon River, sits next to the sluice gate built by her sons to lead the people, looking at the river, looking at the railway, looking at the place where her sons took the train to fight the American devils. What does the mother see there now?

    The military trains full of People's Army and Volunteer Army soldiers rumble and pass by majestically, and groups of "Silver Swallows" of the Korean-Chinese Air Force fly in the sky. Underground, on the river bank, and on the beach, there are destroyed American tanks and broken aluminum wings of American military aircraft, as well as a field of abundant crops. This is the price the mother paid for giving up her sons. The sons will never return, and the American army can never come again. Whenever she sees this kind of scene, she seems to be comforted, and a layer of happy brilliance appears on her old face.

    Every time I pass through this intersection of the Cheongcheon River estuary and the railway, I naturally think of the image of that mother. She is right in front of my eyes: with one hand stroking her chest and the other hand brushing the hair blown by the cold wind, like a contemplative statue, sitting on the stone embankment next to the sluice gate, gazing at the river there, as if still silently muttering: Son, come back, come back!

    Dear mother – every time I think of this, I can't wait to run up to her and tell her again, mother, don't cry, don't shed tears, look at your sons, they have all returned to your side, their number is really large, their team is really strong! Don't you see? Mother, even we are your relatives!

    "Yes, they are all relatives," the mother replied, and she always said this: "But, I still want to take revenge! Before I die, how can I avenge my son?"

    "Before I die," Kim Shin-kan, an old man of seventy-eight who was a family member of a soldier and a neighbor of the old Kang family, interjected: "Before I die, I am determined to see a unified Korea of the people!" The old man Kim twirled his gray beard, raised a glass of Chinese wine that we offered him, and said to us calmly: "When the American army fled from our place, I wanted to 'keep' them, but I didn't know they couldn't stand being beaten and wouldn't listen to orders. I said to them: 'Why don't you stay a little longer? Don't you have planes, tanks, and artillery? Haha, why are you leaving so hastily and so busy!'" At this time, the elder who mocked the Americans drank the wine, and he proudly smiled and said to us: "That's because you came, Chinese comrades! Come on, you also drink a glass of our rice wine! I have four sons, eight grandsons, and seven great-grandchildren since liberation. I have four grandsons in the People's Army, in the air force, navy, infantry, and artillery! Most of the other descendants are in various construction posts. I believe I will see the unified Korea of the people, a unified motherland with my own eyes!"

    On the same evening that we met the old man Kim Shin-kan, we went to the house of the chief of Yongdam Township. There, we saw a seven-year-old orphan adopted by the chief. When he saw us Chinese guests, he made a face and first told us: "Uncle, uncle, I saw the Americans!"

    "Ah!" We intentionally teased him: "Tell me, what are the Americans like?"

    The seven-year-old child continued to make ferocious expressions in his eyes and on his face, saying:

    "Eyes, like this! Hand – making a gesture of holding a gun – like this! Boots – he kicked his feet, as if wearing big boots – like this!"

    "Are you afraid of American soldiers?"

    "No. I'm not afraid of them." The seven-year-old child answered us affirmatively.

    The township chief introduced: When the American army came, they grabbed this child and interrogated him: "Are your father and mother members of the Labor Party? Where have they gone?"

    The child said at the time: "I don't know! You don't want to find them!"

    The American soldiers beat the child for a while, but to no avail. Later, the enemy found the child's parents elsewhere and shot them.

    But now, this child, who since childhood was accustomed to "participating" in meetings in the families of Labor Party members, is pulling on the township chief and shouting in front of us: "Township chief, give me a Party membership card! Give me a Party membership card! I want to participate in the Party meeting! My father and mother, they both had Party membership cards, I saw them, I saw them!" [Note]

    This is the voice of the Korean children – the unconquerable Korean people. This is the steel forged in the flames of war by the descendants of the glorious martyrs of the Korean Workers' Party. The generation of their parents lived and struggled as the punishers of the atrocities of American aggression and as victors. Some of these warriors fell under their own national flag, smiling and sacrificing themselves. But they all, the dead and the living in the entire team, proved that they were guardians of peaceful humanity and that the Korean people were unconquerable.

    [Note] Every member of the Korean Workers' Party wears a Party membership card on their body (inside their underwear), so the children in the family sometimes see it.

    不可征服的人们
    黄钢
    现在，朝鲜响了三年的枪声停止了。当和平的曙光开始降临到朝鲜的城市和乡村，当朝鲜的父母兄妹们到烈士的坟前去告慰自己亲人的时候，我在这里自然地回想起在朝鲜人民中生活过的那些日子，他们留给我的那些不可磨灭的印象，现在变得更加显明和强烈起来。
    我永远记得那一个夜晚，月光下朝鲜孩子们不断的歌声。她们是那样欣喜地连歌载舞，一直到深夜都不停息。这是去年的八月十五日，我在朝鲜前线伊川郡的一个小村庄里，度过了全体农民狂热庆祝的苏联红军解放朝鲜纪念节。从这个最普通的村庄开始，从北朝鲜的中部到海边，前线到后方，我倾听了许多朝鲜人民的声音。就像在这三八线上的小村庄里，深夜还听见朝鲜孩子在高唱朝鲜、苏联和中国三个国家的歌曲一样，我永远记住了那些朝鲜兄弟姊妹们誓词一样的语言。它们表达出和平斗士的心愿。
    在陪同我们去访问朝鲜人民军的路上，朝鲜战士金德峰这样对我说道：
    “同志，你知道我来到朝鲜，感情为什么激动么？我现在还记得我担任侦察任务第一次走进古山镇时的情景。那天敌人刚刚撤退，又是大轰炸之后，什么都烧毁炸塌了，我看见朝鲜同胞在风吹雨打中掩埋尸首。我走近他们。他们都没有哭。这时候，我看见在一个俱乐部的废墟旁边，墙脚下还开着许多花。我看见了死人，本来也没有哭，但是这时候呀，我真是止不住自己的眼泪！我心想：这个房子的主人呢？他们幸福的生活呢？你不知道，那些花呀，是那样的新鲜、那样的美，我在那里看了半天。看了又想，想了又想……”
    金德峰今年二十四岁。他想到他的祖国朝鲜整个的命运。想到祖国幸福的明天，也想到祖国悲惨的过去。他的祖父，是五十多年前在朝鲜抵抗日本侵略者的爱国志士。金德峰生在中国，现在他回到朝鲜来了。金的父亲是个游击队员，在东北抗日游击战争中牺牲了。坚贞的母亲，把金的父亲葬埋之后，自己也心痛地死在丈夫的坟旁。留下了祖父，他屡次地告诉金德峰：“孩子呀，别忘记了你的祖国，你的祖国朝鲜，是一个美丽的国家，那里呀，山水秀丽，气势雄壮，遍地都是鲜花。有一天，你的祖国要解放了，你回去一定要先去看看粉色的无堇花——那是我们的国花。”
        “我自来就记住了我祖父的话。但是我没有想到，我回到朝鲜来，周围是一片废墟，鲜花是开在这废墟上！当时呀，我就一边哭着一边摘起了一枝无堇花；我心里自个对自个许下了愿，说道：‘朝鲜呀，我的祖国，我的父母生养之地，我一定要把我的生命都献给你，让你一定能够实现和平！恢复建设，让粉色的无堇花开遍在你的土地上。’”
    很快，我们就在那开满了玫瑰色的、白色和黄色的六月菊的人民军营地里，依靠了金德峰同志翻译的帮助，听见了那些人民军部队英雄们的讲话了。
    “我们这部队在祖国的每一条河里、每一个山头，都打过仗，我们的战士为这而骄傲。”常驻在人民军某部的作家金永锡同志这样说道：“当我们军队一九五零年向南追击敌人时，追到?东江，敌人败退时把汽油都点燃了，遍地在燃烧。我看见一些耕牛和马匹身上都着了火，成群的牛马都带着火焰，遍地在跑……
    “就在这些疯狂的牛马中间，我第一次地看见了闯进我们国土的死敌——手拿武器的美国干涉军；我看着他们头带钢盔、穿着卡叽布的制服，高腰靴子，手拿冲锋枪！他们出现在这些乱窜乱跳的牛马中间，神色是多么横蛮和恐怖呵！”
    作家金永锡继续说道：“就在这个时候，我伏在山坡上，拧开了手榴弹的盖子，跟我身旁的战士一同摔出去！我听见那些战士们喊道：‘哼，畜生——让你在我们这儿，把我们的田地都弄脏了！’从这一会起，我比任何时候都心疼我身旁的一寸土地、一滴河水、一根花草！……”
    我带着极大的尊重，看着这位金同志——他的一只胳膊最近在美机轰炸中负伤了，手上还缠有绷带。他和我们说话时，漫步在多色的六月菊的花丛中。六月菊在最后的秋阳中，显得是十分鲜艳了。
    他和我们谈到了一九五二年秋季的坚守防御战。他说：
    “当然，敌人在我们阵地前面是碰得头破血流，我们整个部队是越打越强了。最近在三五一高地战斗中，我们有一个十七岁的小鬼——通讯员赵己戴，他在孤守阵地时对敌人高喊道：‘来呀！你们走近一点，再走近一些呀！你们怎么不来呢？’敌人反而不敢走近来了。我们的小鬼接着就大喊道：‘一排向左方，三排正前方，二排向右方，包抄前进！’敌人更加犹豫，要败退了。其实，在我们小鬼身边的战友都牺牲了。只剩下他一个人。他用他的智勇，一个人歼敌六十多人。”
    金永锡说：我问他凭着什么勇气赢得了这次胜利？
    十七岁的赵己戴答道：因为祖国和我在一起。
    和赵己戴同年龄的小通讯员朴龙植，也同样地具有着人民军战士的这种英雄气概。三五一高地叫敌炮轰击得形势危急，一切通讯工具都已经损坏，朴龙植受命要通过敌炮严密封锁的火网，到团部联系补充弹药。他穿过了无数炮击和机枪扫射的危险地区，跑到了团指挥所，自己已经快晕迷了。团政治委员扶起了他说：怎么样，你还可以再冒一回危险，带一个参谋同志再回到阵地上去吗？
    身体已经极度疲乏和饥渴的朴龙植答道：当然可以。
    团政委指着地图说：你上去，让你们左边的前哨班从这个山尖上撤退。朴龙植心想：什么？撤退？他马上感觉浑身拼命挤出来的力气，忽然一点都没有了。他是三个月以前从中学里出来，他的母亲送他来参军的。在他十七岁的人的心灵里，根本就没有“撤退”这个字眼。团政委继续对他说道：转移这个山头，是由于战术上的要求：我们稍稍后撤到山坡后面，为的是吸引敌人前来，用预先标定好的炮火去消灭它，很快山头就会回来的。听到这里，朴龙植这才放心了，他马上从参谋同志手里接过来满满一大杯凉水，一口气喝了下去，好像他是借助这一大杯饮料来使他的头脑更加清醒似的，接着，他马上就愉快地完成任务去了。
    他——朴龙植就坐在我们身边。说到这里，这位挂着带黑线边的纯红色肩章的小通讯员，这位脸被晒得油黑，嘴唇的俏皮的曲线像通常惯于沉默的人一样紧紧地向后收缩着的小通讯员低下了头，卷着他军衣上身的衣角，我们年轻的勇士，这时却显得忸怩不安了。
    “这是我第一次的战斗”。他很不自然地说了这么一句以后，好像不愿再谈自己的战斗一样把话岔开了，他说：“我的学校，你们看，就在这个海边……”顺着他手指的地方看去，海洋的平面，无限广阔地伸展到我们面前。黄昏中显得是浅蓝、灰蓝、一直到极远处是深绿色的海面，在我们的近处，卷来了白色花边一样的海潮。海上的波涛在奔腾着。这是不可抑止的波涛。这就是他的家乡。
    “……我喜欢我们这个海边。”朴龙植说：“每回上地理课的时候，我就在大地球仪上找了又找，我想看看我们这一块海洋的曲线，在大地球仪上，到底占多长呢？”等了一会，他再补充一句说：
    “我在暑假前就已经念完初中三年级了，我母亲说：‘朴龙植呀，你去挡住美国人，胜利了再回来！’”
    我们问他：这次战争以后，你打算再作什么呢？
    “念书。”他回答道：“我念的书太少了。”朴龙植说时，还顺手拈起了一片枫叶。这里的枫树真是不少。
    “你在学校里喜欢什么功课呢？”
    “最喜欢的：是俄文。”
    “还有呢？”
    “生物学。”他看着手里的那片枫叶，回答得迅速而且明确，好像那片深红色枫叶上的脉络，对他有着什么启示似的。
    我们离开这个营地的时候，他沿着海边把我们送了好远，最后，我们都注意地看着他背着那支新式步枪，经过他父母耕作过的田地，返回他的连队去了。
    我们车子经过了这个海边。这确是美丽的地方。接近成熟的草绿色稻田的柔和的胸膛，正在海边的晚风中妩媚地起伏摇荡。黛绿色的松林过去了，赭黑色的崖石过去了。不久以后，我们就来到朝鲜后方农村中喧闹着的打谷场上。这里，穿着长裙的姑娘们，轮班在踏着打谷机。丰满的秋收到来了。
    在安州郡龙潭面凤鹤里烈属老康家的打谷机旁边，我看见了康家的小孙女儿康满玉，她穿着黑色海军制服，她在帮助家人打过稻子之后，正在凝神静志地复习着她的中学俄文功课。
    在场上打谷，到学校念书，安静的夜晚，明亮的灯光，在战时的朝鲜要得到这些真不容易啊！这和朴龙植、赵己戴、金德峰的英勇战斗分不开，也和每一个家庭的斗争和牺牲分不开。就拿康家来说吧：康满玉的父亲——解放前的铁路工人，解放后的农业革新家，劳动党党员，祖国的积极建设者，叫美国人的监狱磨折死了。康满玉的叔父——区政府的民兵队长，在游击活动中打了多少个漂亮仗，后来被美国干涉军俘虏了，枪毙在广场上。老母亲伏在儿子身上哭着说道：“儿子呀！多好的儿子呀！你不应该死，你好像没有死，我要为你报仇呀！”
    过去，有过多少个夜晚哪，大风大雪，母亲都是亲自在等候着儿子回来！但现在，儿子再不会回来了；再不会像过去那样，到区上去照料修建水坝以后，鸡叫了，大儿子拖着困倦的身子转回来。再不会像过去那样了，每一个游击队员都可以听见二儿子清醒幽默的分析和热情鼓动的声音。现在，是妹妹继承着大哥和二哥，在稻田里、在轰炸下、领导着民青盟员，作为劳动党支部坚强的助手，日夜修建着水坝。现在，是女儿康满玉继承着父亲，在稻场上精明地登记着丰收，在集会上高声地朗诵着报纸。尽管这样，丢失了儿子的母亲心中还是蕴藏着复仇的火焰，还在想念她的儿子。她常常跑到清川江边，跑到儿子领导人们修好的水闸旁边坐着，看着江水，看着铁路，看着儿子坐着火车出发打美国鬼子的地方，现在呢？母亲在那儿看到的是什么呢？
    人民军和志愿军满载的军用列车轰鸣着，威武地通过，天上飞着的是朝中空军成群的“银燕”。地下、江边、沙滩上，有着被打毁的美军坦克、和折断了的铝制的美国军用机的残破翅膀，还有那一片丰收的庄稼，这就是母亲交出了儿子的代价。儿子们不再回来，美军也不能再来了。每当她看到这种情景的时候，她就仿佛得到了慰藉一样，苍老的脸上泛起一层欣喜的光彩。
    我每回来往经过这个清川江口与铁路交叉点的时候，每回也都是很自然地想起那位母亲的形象。她就在我的眼前：一手抚着自己的心胸，一手掠着被冷风吹动的头发，好像是一座沉思的雕像似的，坐在水闸旁的石堤上，在举眼凝望那里的江水，好像还在默念着：儿子呀，你回来吧，你们回来吧！
    亲爱的母亲，——每回我想到这里，恨不得就跑到她跟前去，又一次地对她讲道，母亲，不要哭泣，不要流泪，你看看你的儿子吧，他们都回到你身边来了，他们的数目是真多，他们的队伍真强壮呵！你没有看见吗？母亲，连我们一起，都是你的亲人呀！
    “是的，都是亲人”，母亲是这样回答的，她是一向这样说的：“但是，我还要报仇呵！在我未死以前，怎么给我儿子报仇才好呢？”
    “在我死以前，”老康家的邻居、一位军属老头，金信坎，已经七十八岁了，这样插言道：“在我死以前，我是立志要看见人民的统一的朝鲜！”金老头撚着自己灰白的胡须，举着我们敬给他的一杯中国葡萄酒，从容地对我们说道：“美国军队打我们这儿败走的时候，我倒想‘留一留’他们，哪晓得他们经不起揍，都不听使唤了。我冲着他们说：‘你们为什么不多呆一会呢？你们不是有飞机，有坦克，有大炮吗？哈哈，你们为什么要走得这么急、这么忙呵！’”这时，嘲弄过美国人的年长者喝下了酒，他骄傲地笑着对我们说：“那是因为你们来了，中国同志！来吧，你们也喝一杯我们的米酒！我有四个儿子，八个孙子，解放以后添了七个曾孙。我有四个孙子在人民军里面，空军、海军、步兵、炮兵里都有！别的一些子孙们多在各种建设的岗位上。我相信我会亲眼看见人民的统一的朝鲜，统一的祖国！”
    就在这会晤过老人金信坎的当晚，我们走到了这龙潭面的区长家里，在那里，我们看见了区长收养的一个七岁的孤儿。他见了我们这些中国客人，比划了一个鬼脸，首先就告诉道：“叔叔，叔叔，我看见了美国人了！”
    “啊！”我们有意地引逗他：“你说说，美国人是什么样呢？”
    七岁的孩子在自己的眼睛里和脸面上继续装扮出凶恶的样子，说：
    “眼睛，是这样的！手里——做着拿枪的手势——是这样的！靴子——他踢着脚，好像穿着大靴子的样子——是这样的！”
    “你怕美国兵吗？”
    “不怕。我不怕他们。”七岁的孩子肯定地回答我们说。
    区长介绍道：美国军队来时，把这小孩抓去了，向孩子拷问道：“你的父亲、母亲，是劳动党员么？他们到哪儿去了？”
    小孩当时说：“我不知道！你们不要想找到他们！”
    美国兵痛打了这小孩一阵，没有结果。后来，敌人从别处找到小孩的父母，把他们枪毙了。
    但是，现在，这自小就惯于在劳动党员的家庭里“参加”开会的小孩，却当着我们的面，扯住区长嚷叫道：“区长呵，给我党证吧！给我党证！我要参加党的会议！我的父亲、母亲他们有两个党证，我都看见了的，我都看见了！”〔注〕
    这就是朝鲜的幼童——不可战胜的朝鲜人民的声音。这是朝鲜劳动党光荣烈士的后代——在战火中炼出的钢铁。他们父母的一代，是作为美国侵略暴行的惩办者，作为胜利者而生存和斗争过的。其中有的勇士们是倒在自己的国旗下，含笑而牺牲了。但是，他们全体，全体队伍中的死者和生者，都证明了自己是和平人类中的卫士，都证明了朝鲜人民是不可征服的。
    〔注〕朝鲜劳动党党证每个党员都挂带在自己身上（内衣里面），故家中的小孩有时会看见。
