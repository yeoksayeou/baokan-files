(Xinhua News Agency, August 25th) Since the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting in June passed the declaration to launch a world movement to strive for negotiation, the movement to strive for peaceful negotiated solutions to international disputes among major powers has unfolded in various ways in the capitalist world.

After the close of the Budapest meeting, the Korean armistice was achieved with the active efforts of the world's peace forces, which greatly encouraged the peace-loving people of all countries. The people of all countries see from the Korean armistice that negotiation can resolve international disputes, and that major power consultations can further ease international tensions. However, the people of all countries also vigilantly recognize that in order to truly realize major power consultations and truly ease international tensions, persistent struggle is still needed. Because the bellicose forces headed by the US aggressive bloc are still making every effort to pursue a "cold war" and international provocation policies. They are afraid of peace, so they try their best to prevent major powers from holding consultations in order to maintain international tensions. Therefore, the people of all countries are launching a movement to strive for major power consultations with great force.

The people of Western Europe are direct victims of the American "cold war" policy, so the call of the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting immediately received a wide response among them. In late June, people from all walks of life in France held a "French National Conference for Peace Negotiations" in Paris. The slogan of the meeting was "Negotiation for Peace." Representatives from all provinces of France attended, including famous political and religious leaders, social figures, writers, clergy, workers, farmers, housewives, mothers of soldiers who were killed or wounded in Vietnam, and representatives of many political parties. Representatives of all social strata and political parties spoke at the meeting, demanding a peaceful end to existing wars and demanding negotiated solutions to all disputed international issues. After this national conference, the movement for peace negotiation was launched on a large scale throughout France. The specific slogans of this movement include: peaceful settlement of the Indochina war and the German issue, and France should contribute to easing international tensions. The movement is unfolding in various ways: collecting signatures for the "Peace Handbook," holding mass rallies, and sending delegations to petition members of municipal councils, provincial senators, and members of the National Assembly. Currently, this movement has achieved preliminary results. More than 100 municipal councils have declared their support for peace negotiations. Many cities have held city-wide mass meetings to discuss how to launch a comprehensive struggle for peace. In many regions, most residents have signed the "Peace Handbook."

The Central Council of the British Peace Committee held a meeting in July, announcing its support for the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting declaration and deciding to launch a large-scale movement for peace action in Britain. The British common people's desire for peace negotiation is constantly growing. In the six weeks from June to July, more than 30,000 people signed appeals to members of Parliament demanding major power consultations. On July 12, more than 8,000 London citizens held a demonstration demanding major power consultations to peacefully resolve international disputes. The broad masses of British workers are increasingly strongly demanding a peaceful solution to international disputes. The National Union of Mineworkers of Great Britain, with 700,000 members, the National Union of Railwaymen, with 400,000 members, the Civil Service Union, the Electrical Trades Union and other organizations, passed resolutions at their recent annual meetings demanding major powers hold negotiations to ease international tensions. This will, increasingly strongly expressed by the broad masses of workers, has influenced the right-wing trade union leadership. The General Council of the Trades Union Congress also advocated major power consultations in its annual report published on the 24th.

The Italian National Peace Council held a meeting in mid-July, deciding to launch a movement based on the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting declaration. Then, in late July, a National Peace Congress was convened, with hundreds of representatives from all over the country participating. The Congress called on the Italian people to take action to put Italy's foreign policy on a new path and contribute to easing international tensions.

Danish peace advocates recently held a Danish National Peace Congress in Copenhagen, which passed a resolution expressing support for the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting declaration. In Belgium, people from all walks of life and various faiths recently held a meeting in Brussels, calling on the Belgian people to demand that the Belgian government support peace negotiations.

In India, the All-India Peace Council held a meeting in July, which passed a resolution expressing support for the resolutions of the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting and deciding to participate fully in the international movement demanding the resolution of international disputes through negotiation. The resolution also called on all peace committees in India and all organizations and individuals engaged in peace work to immediately launch a campaign to collect signatures on the declaration advocating the resolution of international disputes through negotiation.

The Japanese "National Promoters' Association for Peace Month" held a meeting in July, deciding to respond to the call of the World Peace Council and hold rallies across the country to widely disseminate the spirit of this call.

In Indonesia, a National Peace Congress is scheduled to be held at the end of October. Currently, local peace conferences are being held across the country to elect representatives to attend the National Peace Congress.

In Australia, peace advocates have also launched a movement to strive for negotiation and will hold a National Peace Congress at the end of September.

Many countries in Latin America are also launching movements demanding major power consultations. The Brazilian Committee for the Defense of Peace supports the World Peace Council's Budapest meeting declaration and has decided to hold a national people's vote on the movement to strive for negotiation from September 1st to October 15th. Under the influence of the Brazilian people's movement demanding consultation, many municipal and state councils have passed resolutions calling on the Brazilian government to support the proposal to conclude peace covenants. More than 500 representatives from all walks of life in Guatemala recently held a National Peace Congress, which unanimously passed a resolution calling for the resolution of international disputes through negotiation. Argentine peace fighters have also launched a movement to strive for a peaceful solution to international disputes.

In the United States, despite the ruling group's efforts to spread lies and continue to create an atmosphere of tension, the idea of demanding peace negotiation is increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of ordinary people. Leaders from the US labor, religious, professional, and cultural circles recently established the "National Lobby for Peace Organization" to demand that members of Congress promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean and Asian issues. The realization of the Korean armistice encouraged the peace-loving people of the United States. A thousand people in New York held a meeting on August 12 under the slogan "Negotiation - The Road to Peace" to celebrate the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Congress passed a letter to the US President, demanding to establish lasting peace in Korea and other places in the world through negotiation.

Currently, the countries that have launched the movement to strive for negotiation are gradually deepening and developing this movement, attracting more and more people from broader strata to participate.

    资本主义各国人民受到朝鲜停战的鼓舞
    展开争取协商解决国际争端运动
    【新华社二十五日讯】自从世界和平理事会今年六月布达佩斯会议通过展开世界争取协商运动的宣言以来，争取大国协商和平解决国际争端运动已以各种方式在资本主义世界展开。
    布达佩斯会议闭幕后，朝鲜停战在世界和平力量积极努力下得到实现，极大地鼓舞了各国爱好和平的人民。各国人民从朝鲜停战中看到，协商是能够解决国际争端的，大国举行协商是能够进一步缓和国际紧张局势的。但是，各国人民也警惕地认识到，要使大国间协商真正实现，国际紧张局势真正缓和，还需要进行坚持的斗争。因为，以美国侵略集团为首的好战势力目前还在竭力推行“冷战”及国际挑衅政策，它们害怕和平，所以竭力阻止大国举行协商，以便保持国际紧张局势。因此，各国人民都以很大的力量来开展争取大国协商的运动。
    西欧人民是美国“冷战”政策的直接受害者，因此，世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议的号召，在他们中间立即获得广泛的响应。六月下旬，法国不同阶层的各界人士在巴黎举行了“法国争取和平谈判全国会议”，会议的口号是“为和平而协商”，到会的有法国各省的代表，其中包括著名的政治和宗教领袖、社会名流、作家、教士、工人、农民、家庭妇女、在越南伤亡的军人的母亲和许多政党的代表。各社会阶层和政治党派的代表在会上都发言要求和平结束现有战争，要求协商解决所有争执的国际问题。在这次全国会议以后，争取和平协商运动即在法国全国各地大规模展开。这个运动的具体口号中包括：和平解决印度支那战争及德国问题，法国应对缓和国际紧张局势作出贡献。运动是以各种方式展开的：为“和平手册”征集签名，举行群众集会，派遣代表团向市政委员会委员、省参议员和国民议会议员请愿等。目前这个运动已获得初步成果。已有一百多个市政委员会宣布赞成和平协商。许多城市举行了全市群众大会，讨论怎样展开争取和平的全面斗争。在许多地区，大部分居民都已在
    “和平手册”上签名。
    英国和平委员会中央理事会在七月间举行会议，宣布支持世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议宣言，并决定在英国发动一个大规模的争取和平行动的运动。英国普通人民要求和平协商的情绪正在不断增长。从六月到七月的六星期中，有三万多人在致议会议员要求举行大国协商的呼吁书上签了名。七月十二日，八千多伦敦市民举行了要求大国协商和平解决国际争端的示威游行。英国广大工人群众越来越强烈地要求和平解决国际争执问题。有着七十万会员的英国全国矿工联盟、有着四十万会员的全国铁路工人工会、全国公务员工会、电气工会等团体，在最近举行的年会上，都通过了要求大国举行谈判以缓和国际紧张局势的决议。广大工人群众愈来愈强烈表示的这种意志，已影响及于右翼工会领导。英国职工大会的最高委员会也在它二十四日发表的年度报告中主张大国协商。
    意大利全国和平理事会在七月中旬举行会议，决定以世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议宣言为基础发动一个运动。接着，在七月下旬，召开了全国和平大会，有全国各地几百个代表参加。大会号召意大利人民以行动使意大利的外交政策走上新的道路，而对缓和国际紧张局势有所贡献。
    丹麦的和平拥护者最近在哥本哈根举行了丹麦全国和平大会，大会通过决议表示支持世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议宣言。在比利时，各阶层、各种信仰的人士最近在布鲁塞尔举行会议，号召比利时人民要求比利时政府支持和平协商。
    在印度，全印和平理事会于七月间举行会议，会议通过决议，表示支持世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议的决议，决定以全力参加要求用协商方式解决国际争端的国际运动。决议并号召印度各和平委员会和一切从事和平事业的团体和个人，立即发动征集在主张协商解决国际争端的宣言上签名的运动。
    日本“和平月全国发起人会”七月间举行会议，决定响应世界和平理事会的号召，在全国各地举行集会，广泛传播这个号召的精神。
    在印度尼西亚，订在十月底举行全国和平大会。目前全国各地正在举行地方和平会议，选举出席全国和平大会的代表。
    在澳大利亚，和平拥护者也展开了争取协商运动，将在九月底举行全国和平大会。
    拉丁美洲许多国家也正在展开要求大国协商的运动。巴西保卫和平委员会支持世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议宣言，决定从九月一日到十月十五日举行关于争取协商运动的全国人民投票。在巴西人民要求协商运动的影响下，许多市议会及州议会都通过决议，要求巴西政府支持缔结和平公约的建议。危地马拉各阶层的五百多个代表最近举行了全国和平大会，大会一致通过决议，要求以协商方式来解决国际争执问题。阿根廷和平战士也展开了一个争取和平解决国际争端的运动。
    在美国，尽管统治集团竭力散布谎言，继续制造紧张空气，要求和平协商的思想却日益深入普通人民心中。美国劳工界、宗教界、自由职业者和文化界的领袖最近成立了“全国院外运动和平组织”，要求议员促成朝鲜和亚洲问题的和平解决。朝鲜停战的实现，鼓舞了美国爱好和平的人民。纽约一千群众八月十二日在“协商——获致和平的道路”的口号下举行了大会，庆祝朝鲜停战协定的签订。大会通过致美国总统的信，要求以协商方式在朝鲜和世界其他地方建立持久和平。
    目前，已经展开争取协商运动的各国，正在把这个运动逐步深入发展，吸引更广泛阶层人民参加。
