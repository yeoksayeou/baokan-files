Taiyuan Cement Plant Should Emphasize Product Quality

    The Taiyuan Cement Plant overfulfilled its production plan in the first half of this year, but failed to meet the planned quality targets in any single month. The average quality of both ordinary cement and mixed cement products in the first half of the year reached only 84.3 percent of the quality standards. May is the peak season for cement sales, when basic construction projects start. However, the Taiyuan Cement Plant's products, due to their poor quality, could not be sold, resulting in an inventory backlog of more than 2,800 tons of cement. The contract signed in May between the plant and basic construction units to supply 10,000 tons of cement was reduced to 8,000 tons.

    The poor quality of Taiyuan Cement Plant's products is due to the following reasons: First, production is uneven, making it difficult to effectively control product quality. Second, the batching inspection is inaccurate. Third, the plant's leadership has long neglected product quality and lacks a comprehensive view of completing production tasks. In May, the C shift of the calcination workshop created a new record, but 50 percent of its products were substandard. Although the leadership knew about this situation, they still sent congratulatory messages and gave awards, without mentioning the poor quality at all. This approach naturally encouraged a mindset among the masses that emphasized quantity over quality.

    太原水泥厂应重视产品质量
    太原水泥厂今年上半年超额完成了生产计划，但是却没有一个月能达到计划的质量指标。普通水泥和混合水泥两种产品上半年总平均达到质量指标的百分之八十四点三弱。五月份正是基本建设工程开工的时候，也是水泥畅销的旺月。太原水泥厂的产品却因为质量低劣推销不出，把二千八百多吨水泥积压在库房内。五月份该厂和基本建设单位订的供应一万吨水泥的合同，也改成为八千吨。
    太原水泥厂产品质量不好有以下几个原因：一、生产不均衡，不能很好地控制产品的质量。二、配料检验不准确。三、该厂领导方面长期忽视产品质量，缺乏全面完成生产任务的观点。五月份烧成车间丙班创造班创造了新记录，但产品质量却有百分之五十不合格，领导方面虽知道这种情况，还是给送了喜报，发了奖，根本没提质量不好的问题。这种作法自然也助长了群众中重量轻质的思想。
