Students from Dalian Institute of Technology, Northeast Institute of Technology, Tianjin University, Chongqing University, and other schools have made significant progress in their technical skills and greatly enriched their practical knowledge through conscientious production internships.

Students from Dalian Institute of Technology, distributed in Anshan, Fushun, Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Dalian and other places for internships, were particularly active. In their internships, they applied their theoretical knowledge to explain actual production, thereby consolidating and enriching their theoretical knowledge. Students majoring in synthetic ammonia applied their knowledge of crystallization theory in physical chemistry to explain the operation process of acid-base neutralization and compound crystallization in a certain section, changing their past view that physical chemistry was "pure science." Students majoring in coking at the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Institute, who were interning at the Chemical General Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, had a good understanding of the layout of the workshop and mastered important techniques such as temperature control of coke ovens and operation of blowers. Students were generally able to explain on-site problems theoretically. Students from Chongqing University interning at Factory 506 went into the boiler to observe its structure during boiler shutdown maintenance; students from the Department of Metallurgy of the University interned at Factory 101, observing ironmaking in the blast furnace, which gave concrete evidence to their theoretical studies. Many problems that students did not understand in school were largely solved during the internship. Zhang Yusheng, a student in the Industrial Electricity Specialization Course at Tianjin University, said: Many problems that could not be understood in school became very clear after seeing the actual objects and going through actual operation. Students from the University who were interning at the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory earnestly studied, and many students mastered the basic production technology and were able to manufacture qualified products. Students also began to apply their professional knowledge and technology to production and improve production. Students majoring in coking at Dalian Institute of Technology completed 24 technical measurements and tests for the factory during their internship at Anshan Iron and Steel, and put forward 26 suggestions for improving production. According to the statistics of the crude benzene workshop alone, they created a wealth of 1.1888 billion yuan for the country, and were rewarded by the Chemical General Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel. Students from the Institute who were interning at Jilin Chemical Plant made 13 rationalization proposals to the factory, including helping the factory adjust the temperature of the refrigerator, which increased production by 30%. Students from Dalian Institute of Technology who were interning at a certain oil refinery also applied a heat balance formula from Soviet textbooks to production, greatly improving calculation efficiency.

During this internship, students from the above-mentioned schools saw the recovery and development of the motherland's industry and the prospects for industrialization, which greatly encouraged their enthusiasm for learning. Students from Northeast Institute of Technology interning at Northeast Machinery Factory No. 6 realized the importance of transforming old factories. Northeast Machinery Factory No. 6 was merged from three dilapidated small repair shops left over from the Japanese and puppet regimes, and has now been transformed into an advanced production factory. Chu Wenbin, an intern student at the Institute, said: In the past, I thought that entering a factory meant entering a modern factory. From the internship, I saw that new equipment is important, but old equipment must also be transformed and fully utilized. As soon as the students entered the factory, they felt a great sense of responsibility. This sense of responsibility has become their confidence and determination to build the motherland. They love their major even more. Intern students majoring in mining machinery manufacturing at Northeast Institute of Technology expressed that they would study their major well, manufacture countless mining machines to exploit the treasures of the motherland, and contribute all their strength to the industrialization of the motherland. Students from the automobile group of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Chongqing University specifically realized the complexity of the automobile manufacturing industry and the development prospects of the motherland's transportation industry during the internship, completely changing the mistaken idea that repairing and manufacturing automobiles had no "future." Zhang Dongben, a student in the Department of Power Engineering of the University, said: I didn't want to study power engineering before, but now I know that power is the artery of all machine transportation. He said that he would work harder in the future and fully master the knowledge of his major. When students majoring in coal mining at the China University of Mining and Technology were interning at Fuxin Coal Mine, they happened to witness the start of production at the Haizhou Open-pit Coal Mine in Fuxin. Many students saw the production situation of a modern coal mine and the infinitely beautiful prospects of the motherland's coal industry, greatly increasing their sense of honor and determination to serve the motherland's coal industry.

Due to their willingness to learn from the workers and the workers' enthusiastic help, the above-mentioned intern students established a close friendship with the workers. Northeast Machinery Factory No. 6 sent five workers and technicians to guide the internship of students majoring in mechanical manufacturing at Northeast Institute of Technology under very tight production conditions, and the students were very touched. Qian Xingwu, an old lathe operator at the factory, set aside a six-foot lathe for the students to practice on. When the students produced good products, Qian Xingwu said: They are doing a great job, and they are closely united with us. The country's industrial construction has added a new force. When students majoring in metal industry at Tianjin University were at the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory, Qian Jiaguang, a famous national model worker in industry, introduced to the students his experience of transforming a gantry planer into a gantry milling machine to increase efficiency by 3.5 times. The workers in each group of the factory also formulated specific plans to help the students do a good job in production internships. Students majoring in machine manufacturing at Tianjin University who were interning at the state-owned Tianjin Machine Factory and students in the housing specialization course who were interning at construction sites, as well as students from Chongqing University who were interning at Factory 506 and Factory 101, received enthusiastic guidance from the workers, especially the master craftsmen, who unreservedly taught the students the rich operating experience they had accumulated over decades, and the students also exchanged the theoretical knowledge they had learned with the operating experience of the workers.

During the internship, the teachers and students of the fourth grade of the coking major of the Department of Chemical Engineering of Dalian Institute of Technology also created excellent internship methods. They made achievements in formulating practical internship plans, establishing guidance institutions and necessary internship systems, and emphasizing the combination of internship and production, and were commended by the Internship Guidance Committee of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. During the internship, Northeast Institute of Technology organized an inspection team to focus on checking the internship of the school's students in Anshan, which played a great role in improving the internship effect and improving future internship work.
