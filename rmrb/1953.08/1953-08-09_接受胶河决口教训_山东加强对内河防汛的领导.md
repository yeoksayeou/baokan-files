Learning from the Jiao River Breach
Shandong Strengthens Leadership in Inland River Flood Control

Since the beginning of summer, Shandong Province has experienced frequent heavy rains, causing water levels in inland rivers to rise. Some areas have suffered from breaches and flooding. The causes of these breaches, aside from isolated instances of irresistible mountain torrents, are mostly due to inadequate flood control work on inland rivers. For example, after heavy rains on June 19th in the Jiaozhou Special District, the Jiao River's water level was still 1.5 meters below the top of the dike. Yet, a breach occurred at Gaopingzhuang in the fourth district of Gaomi. However, the local leadership did not take this as a warning and only hastily repaired the breach. Then on July 2nd, when the water level was one meter below the top of the dike, a second breach occurred. The Shandong Provincial People's Government learned from this incident and issued new instructions for flood control work. The instructions emphasized that leadership over flood control organizations should be strengthened, and flood control headquarters at all levels should immediately begin operations. The Provincial Flood Control Headquarters dispatched inspection teams to the grassroots level for inspections and required local governments along the rivers to immediately organize forces to conduct focused and in-depth inspections of the effectiveness of dikes, establish and improve mass flood control organizations, and ensure that inland rivers do not breach below the guaranteed water level. The instructions further pointed out that the current serious problem is complacency, stemming from a lack of understanding among cadres regarding the unity of flood control and production, and a failure to resolve the contradiction between leading production and leading flood control. The instructions required that in areas that have already experienced breaches, governments at all levels should organize forces to go deep into the flood-stricken areas to mobilize the masses to drain accumulated water. Small seedlings that have been washed away and cannot grow should be immediately replanted or replaced with late-autumn crops. In areas with deep and undrainable accumulated water, the masses should be organized for production and self-salvation. At the same time, river dikes should be repaired to prevent further breaches and disasters during heavy rains. In all areas where breaches have occurred, the causes of the breaches should be thoroughly investigated, distinguishing between those caused by irresistible floods, for which preventive measures should be organized, and those caused by negligence in prevention, for which responsibility should be determined and appropriate punishment given to those responsible.

    接受胶河决口教训
    山东加强对内河防汛的领导
    山东省自从入夏以来，各地屡降暴雨，内地河流水位上涨，有些地区决口成灾。决口原因，除个别地区因山洪暴发，水势汹涌不可抗拒外，大部地区多是由于对内地河流防汛工作不力所造成。如胶州专区六月十九日大雨后，胶河水位距堤顶尚差一·五公尺，即在高密四区高平庄处决口，但当地领导方面仍未引起警惕，只草率堵住，至七月二日水位距堤顶一公尺时，又第二次决口。山东省人民政府吸取这一事件的教训，对防汛工作随又作了新的指示。指示中首先指出，应加强对防汛组织的领导，各级防汛指挥部应立即开始办公；省防汛指挥部即派检查组深入下层进行检查，并要求沿河各地政府也立即组织力量，重点深入检查堤防实效，建立与健全群众防汛组织，切实保障内地河流在保证水位下不发生溃决。指示又指出，目前严重的问题是麻痹思想，这是由于干部对防汛与生产的一致性认识不足，没有注意解决领导生产和领导防汛的矛盾问题。指示要求：凡已决口地区，各级政府应组织力量深入水灾区动员群众排除积水，已经冲淤不能生长的小苗，应立即组织补种或改种晚秋作物，积水过深及不能排除积水的地区要组织群众生产自救，同时要修复河堤以防大雨时再次决口成灾。凡是决口的地区，并应深入检查决口原因，分清那些是由于不可抗拒的水患造成的，应组织如何预防，那些是由于疏于防范造成的，应查明责任，给当事者以适当处分。
