    Northeast soybean growth is good. Soybeans in Northeast China are growing well and are now generally flowering and podding. A good harvest is expected if there are no unexpected disasters in the future.
    Northeast soybeans are famous at home and abroad. In recent years, with the restoration and development of China's economy, the soybean planting area in Northeast China has continued to increase. This year, the soybean planting area in the entire region increased by 35 percent compared with 1949. Due to the increase in planting area and the improvement of yield per unit area, the total soybean output in the entire region last year exceeded the highest pre-war output by 11.8 percent.
    In order to strive for increased soybean production, farmers in Northeast China have continued to actively improve farming techniques this year. Most soybean fields in the region have been planted with improved varieties. More than 90 percent of soybean fields in Songjiang Province have been planted with the "Mancangjin" improved variety. In many areas of Jilin and Liaoxi provinces, the improved soybean variety "Xiaojinhuang," which is suitable for local soil and climate, has been planted. More than 52 percent of the soybean fields in the region were treated with rhizobium inoculant, an increase of more than five times compared with last year. The phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows in soybean fields has also been greatly reduced compared with previous years. All of these have created favorable conditions for the good growth of soybeans.

    东北大豆生长良好
    东北各地大豆生长良好，目前正普遍开花结荚，今后如无意外灾害，可望丰收。
    东北大豆闻名国内外。几年来，随着我国经济恢复和发展，东北各地大豆种植面积不断增加。今年全区大豆播种面积比一九四九年增加了百分之三十五。由于播种面积增加和单位面积产量提高，去年全区大豆总产量已超过战前最高产量百分之十一点八。 
    为争取大豆增产，今年东北各地农民继续积极改进耕作技术。全区大部豆田都种上了优良品种。松江省百分之九十以上的豆田种了“满仓金”良种。吉林、辽西等省很多地区种了适于当地土质、气候的良种大豆“小金黄”。全区使用根瘤菌拌种的豆田，占豆田总面积百分之五十二强，比去年增加了五倍多。豆田缺苗、断条现象也比往年大大减少。这些都给大豆的良好生长创造了有利条件。
