At the first conference of hero and model representatives of the Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I interviewed the heroes and models of the Railway Public Security Forces. Before attending the meeting, they and their comrades guarded the bridges and tunnels on all the railways of the motherland day and night with utmost loyalty, ensuring the safety and smooth flow of the railways.

It is very hard for the soldiers to work on bridges and in tunnels. Some bridges and tunnels are surrounded by towering, uninhabited mountains, while others are surrounded by boundless snow and primeval forests. Sometimes the soldiers use clapper rhymes to describe their living environment, saying: "Going out, we see mountain tops; entering, we squat in bunkers; day and night, we guard the bridgeheads..."

The soldiers realize that although life is hard, this kind of work is an indispensable part of building and defending the motherland, and is therefore an honor.

I heard many heroes and models report on their work with words like these:

"The bananas, pineapples, coconuts, pomelos, and other fruits of the South are transported from this small tunnel of mine to all parts of the motherland."

"Materials from the motherland supporting the Chinese People's Volunteers are transported to Korea over this bridge of mine."

"Every day I see materials supporting Anshan Iron and Steel pass by on my line, and I also see various products produced by Anshan workers transported from this line to all parts of the country."

The soldiers use clapper rhymes to describe their relationship with the construction of the motherland:

"Public security soldiers guard the bridges, trains come and go smoothly, wood and iron, build many factories in the motherland, we also have a share of the strength."

It is on the basis of this love for the motherland and respect for honor that the soldiers develop a high sense of responsibility. They selflessly and loyally guard the railway lines.

At a certain station, there were four carriages full of flammables parked there. Due to the impact of reversing, one of the carriages started to smoke. The escorts on the train shouted for help. The soldiers of the Public Security Forces of the eighth and tenth squads guarding this station quickly arrived at the scene with combat actions. Tang Zhongguo, the deputy squad leader of the tenth squad, was the first to rush into the smoking carriage regardless of his own safety. He lay on the carriage and saw several flammables smoking. At that time, he didn't think about his own danger at all, and approached the burning materials with brave and swift movements, just like charging on the front line. The burning materials were pressed at the bottom, and to move them out, the flammables on top had to be moved aside first. Tang Zhongguo did not hesitate and quickly moved the flammables. He had two injuries on his hands and his clothes were torn, but he ignored these and continued to move. Influenced by his brave behavior, the comrades also rushed into the carriage to grab and move the materials. They quickly buried the burning materials in the soil. According to a post-incident inspection, the flammables would have exploded in another five minutes.

Due to Tang Zhongguo's demonstration of the people's soldiers' high sense of responsibility and self-sacrifice, the Railway Public Security Bureau of a certain place awarded him a major merit once, and the Railway General Administration awarded him a special merit once. He was also named a first-class model, won a first-class award, and also received a first-class medal. When the reporter interviewed him, he humbly said: "This is the result of the party and the superior's education of me. As for the matter of risking moving the burning materials, I didn't think about becoming a hero at the time. I only thought that the motherland's trains and railways must not suffer any loss."

At the first conference of hero and model representatives of the Public Security Forces, there were also two model figures guarding the railway lines. One is Jiao Xiangjun, a model guard who often guards bridges in icy and snowy weather, and the other is Shang Changfa, a model communist and people's hero who guards a tunnel in a certain place on the hot Yuehan Line.

When Jiao Xiangjun guards the bridge, he often automatically works overtime, no matter how cold the weather is. He often says to his comrades: "Protecting the railway should be like protecting your own eyes." Especially during the New Year and holidays, his vigilance is even higher. Once when he was working overtime, he was buried halfway by the snow because the wind and snow were too heavy. But he still stood guard at the bridgehead valiantly. The squad leader and comrades, in order to care for his health, picked him up from the snow and asked him to go home to rest. He then suggested to the squad leader to add fortifications. He and his comrades added fortifications on the frozen, iron-hard ground. Together, they ensured the safety of the railway during the Spring Festival.

The squad that Shang Changfa belongs to is a model squad for protecting the railway. They guard a certain tunnel on the Yuehan Line. The soldiers have to patrol back and forth in the dark tunnel all day long. The tunnel is very humid, and the air is thin. When the train enters the tunnel, the coal smoke inside is choking, the noise is deafening, and the heat makes people dizzy. But the soldiers still compete to work in the tunnel. When the train comes, the soldiers also squat down to check the train's running situation. Shang Changfa is the party group leader. He not only takes the lead in work, but also is good at mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses to guard the railway. He often leads his comrades down the mountain to help farmers transplant rice, sow seeds, and harvest crops. While helping farmers with production, he also helps the village's youth organize a militia team. In this way, with the assistance of the people, they ensured the safety of the tunnel.

"We will guard as long as the motherland needs us to guard." The heroes and models all said in unison. They expressed that they will increase their vigilance a hundredfold, study their business, and enable themselves to better complete the tasks entrusted to them by the people of the motherland.

    光荣的祖国铁道保卫者
    新华社记者    王濯非
    在中国人民解放军公安部队首届功臣模范代表会议上，我访问了铁道公安部队的功臣模范。他们在参加会议以前，和自己的战友日日夜夜、忠心耿耿地守护着祖国所有的铁路线上的桥梁和山洞，保证了铁路的安全和畅通。
    战士们在桥梁上和山洞里工作是很艰苦的。有的桥梁和山洞的周围，都是高耸入云荒无人烟的大山，有的是无边的积雪和原始森林。战士们有时编快板形容自己的生活环境说：“出门看山头，进门蹲在地堡里头，日日夜夜守桥头……。”
    战士们认识到生活虽然艰苦，但是这种工作是建设祖国和保卫祖国中不可缺少的一份重要工作，因而是种荣誉。
    我听到许多功臣模范用这样一些话来报告自己的工作：
    “南方的香蕉、菠萝、椰子、柚子等果品就是从我这个小山洞运向祖国各方的。”
    “祖国支援中国人民志愿军的物资就是打我这个桥上运向朝鲜的。”
    “我每天看到支援鞍钢的物资由我这条线上过去，我也看到鞍钢工人生产出来的各种产品由这条线上运往全国各地。”
    战士们用快板形容他们和祖国建设的关系道：
    “公安战士守桥梁，火车来往很通畅，又是木材又是铁，祖国建设了许多工厂，也有我们一份力量。”
    战士们就在这热爱祖国、尊重荣誉的思想基础上，产生出高度的责任感。他们忘我地、忠心耿耿地守护在铁路线上。
    在某地车站上，停着四节满载着易燃物的车厢，因为倒车撞击的关系，其中有一节车厢里冒出烟来了。车上的押运员大声喊人抢救。守护在这个车站上的八班和十班的公安部队战士们，以战斗的动作迅速赶到了现场。十班副班长唐忠国首先奋不顾身地钻进冒烟的车厢。他伏在车厢上看到有几件易燃物在冒烟。当时，他丝毫没有想到自身的危险，像在前线冲锋一样，以勇敢迅速的动作接近了燃烧物。燃烧物是压在最底层的，要把它们搬出来，必须先把压在上面的易燃物搬在一边。唐忠国一点没有犹豫，迅速地搬移易燃物。他手上有两处受伤，衣服也挂破了，但他不顾这些，还是继续搬。在他的勇敢行为的影响下，同志们也都奋不顾身地上车抢搬。他们迅速地把燃烧物埋到土里去了。据事后检查，易燃物再过五分钟就要爆炸。
    由于唐忠国表现出人民战士高度的责任心和自我牺牲的精神，某地铁路公安局给他记大功一次，铁路总局给他记特等功一次。他并被评为一等模范，荣获一等奖，还得到一枚一等奖章。当记者访问他时，他谦虚地说：“这是党和上级对我教育的结果，至于冒险搬燃烧物的事情，当时我没有想到当功臣，只想到祖国的列车、铁路是不能受到一点损失的。”
    公安部队首届功臣模范代表会议上还有两位守护铁路线的模范人物。一位是经常在冰天雪地中守卫桥梁的守护模范焦相均，一位是守护在炎热的粤汉线某地山洞里的模范共产党员、人民功臣尚长发。
    焦相均守护桥梁时，不管天气多冷，经常自动加班。他常常对同志们说：“保护铁路应像保护自己的眼睛一样。”特别在过年过节的时候，他的警惕性更加提高。有一次加班时，因为风雪太大，他被雪埋下了半截身子。可是他还是雄赳赳地守卫在桥头上。班长和同志们为了关心他的健康，把他从雪里抱起来，要他回家休息。他又向班长建议加修工事。他和同志们在冻得像铁一样坚硬的土地上，加修了工事。他们共同确保了春节时期的铁路安全。
    尚长发所在的班是护路模范班。他们守护着粤汉线上的某处山洞。战士们整天要在黑漆的山洞里往来巡逻。洞内很潮湿，而且空气稀薄，在火车进洞时，洞内煤烟熏人，响声震耳，热得使人发昏。但是战士们仍是争着进洞工作。火车来了，战士们还蹲下去检视火车行驶情况。尚长发是党的小组长，他不但带头工作，而且善于发动群众，依靠群众来守护铁路。他经常带领同志们下山帮助农民插秧、播种、收割。他一面帮助农民生产，一面帮助村里的青年组织民兵队。这样，在人民的协助下，他们确保了山洞的安全。
    “祖国需要我们守护到什么时候，我们就守护到什么时候。”功臣模范们都异口同声地这样说。他们表示，要百倍地提高警惕，钻研业务，使自己能更好地完成祖国人民交予的任务。
