    The Artificial Lake on the Edge of the Gobi Desert - Hongyanchi Reservoir
    By Our Reporter Shao Rui
    East of the Urumqi River, more than ten *hua li* southeast of Dihua, Xinjiang Province, an artificial lake - the Hongyanchi Reservoir - has emerged, built by utilizing the natural terrain. This is a large-scale water conservancy and irrigation project. The reservoir covers an area of approximately five square kilometers, with a storage capacity of 50 million cubic meters, capable of irrigating over 100,000 *mu* of farmland. It is the first large reservoir in Xinjiang and the entire Northwest region.

    The Hongyanchi Reservoir is surrounded by continuous mountain walls to the southeast, and separated by a Gobi highland to the northwest. The low-lying area leading to the canals is where the high and low water gates are conveniently built. The bottom of the reservoir is a natural, impermeable rock layer, making it an ideal location for building a reservoir. Originally, this area was a dried-up ancient salt lake bed, with only a spring forming a small, stagnant pool. The highly saline water was unfit for drinking or any other use. During the reactionary rule, the people of all ethnic groups were exploited in the name of water conservancy construction every year. Starting in 1943, it dragged on for five or six years, resulting in only a brick-lined water tunnel a little over a foot wide and a wooden water gate. This, of course, could not solve the major problem of water shortage for the people of Dihua, who were constantly short of rain and food.

    The city of Dihua is surrounded by mountains on three sides, with an endless Gobi Desert to the north. Like the entire Xinjiang region, it is located in a plateau area isolated from maritime climates, with scarce rainfall. People rely solely on the Urumqi River, formed by melting snow from the Tianshan Mountains, to divert water for irrigation. The Urumqi River originates in the Tianshan Mountains, with a wide riverbed that seeps into the Gobi Desert. After flowing underground for dozens of *li*, it resurfaces and flows through the urban area of Dihua. Its lower reaches are entirely swallowed by the vast Gobi Desert. Only in the middle section of Dihua City do residents rely on the river water flowing between the stones to irrigate their small amount of farmland. Due to the lack of water conservancy and irrigation, there are only 60,000 *mu* of cultivated land here. The food needed for the approximately 100,000 people of Dihua City must be transported from afar from southern Xinjiang and Yili. How to obtain abundant and inexpensive grain is a problem that the people of Dihua have longed to solve for many years, but without success.

    After liberation, the Central People's Government paid special attention to this water conservancy project in the minority areas of Xinjiang, allocating 28 million *jin* of wheat and deciding to rebuild Hongyanchi into a large reservoir. After surveying and designing by water conservancy engineers, a 5-kilometer-long water diversion canal was built south of Hongyanchi to introduce the unused Urumqi River water in winter and some of the summer floods into the reservoir. To the north of Hongyanchi, a 30-kilometer-long Peace Canal was built to transport large amounts of stored water to the Qinggeda Lake and the irrigation areas of the Dihua Collective Farm. From September 1950 to the end of February this year, after two years and six months, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang and the people of all ethnic groups spent nearly one million man-days to finally complete it. Since May, water has already been released, irrigating the large tracts of newly reclaimed farmland on the edge of the Gobi Desert at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains.

    To take care of the farmland irrigation in summer and autumn, the Hongyanchi Reservoir project was mostly carried out in winter. In the work sheds made of felt and mats at the construction site, stoves were lit, gas lamps were turned on, and the work was carried out day and night. The sand, stones, and cement used in the project had to be baked with fire before they could be used. Braving the wind and snow, the soldiers excavated the water diversion canal on the steep slopes. The canal was often blocked by ice and snow, posing a risk of overflowing. They immediately jumped into the river water, several feet deep, to break the ice and clear the snow, allowing the canal to flow smoothly. When they jumped out, their clothes were frozen into hard shells, and their skin turned purple. When building the water gate culvert, the soil layer above was prone to collapse, posing a danger of being crushed and injured. At this time, the Party branch issued a call: "Use the spirit of combat to find a way to support the wooden frame." Everyone responded enthusiastically. After discussing with everyone, the soldier Yang Fenggang used a rope to hang himself in mid-air in the culvert and nailed the wooden frame above. After three days and nights of intense effort by everyone, this arduous task was completed.

    In addition to irrigating the original 60,000 *mu* of farmland, Hongyanchi now irrigates over 100,000 *mu* of newly reclaimed farmland, which is estimated to increase grain production by at least 15 million *jin*. In the future, there is still room to expand this several times, turning the barren land that has been deserted for thousands of years due to lack of water conservancy and irrigation into more arable farmland. At that time, this place could become a granary supplying Dihua with a large amount of food.

    戈壁边上的人造湖——红雁池蓄水库
    本报记者  邵锐
    新疆省迪化东南十多华里的乌鲁木齐河东岸，出现了一座利用自然地形修凿而成的人造湖——红雁池蓄水库。这是一座大型水利灌溉工程。蓄水库面积约五平方公里，蓄水量五千万立方公尺，能灌田十几万亩，是新疆和全西北第一个大蓄水库。
    红雁池东南面围绕着连绵的山壁，西北隔着一片戈壁高地，是通往河渠的洼地，水库的高、低水闸都趁势修在这一带。池底是天然的不渗不漏的石层，这是修建水库的一个理想地区。这儿原是干涸了的古盐湖底、平常只有一股泉水积成一个小小的死水潭，咸味很浓的积水，既不能吃，也不能用。在反动统治时期，每年借兴修水利为名，搜刮着各族人民的金钱；从一九四三年起，拖了五、六年，只修了一道一尺多宽的砖砌水洞和一座木制水闸，这对于无雨缺粮的迪化来说，当然解决不了多大问题。
    迪化市三面环山，北面是一望无边的大戈壁；它和全疆都处在与海洋气候隔绝的高原地区，雨量稀少，人们只靠天山积雪融化而成的一条乌鲁木齐河引水灌田。乌鲁木齐河发源天山，河床宽阔，河水渗漏到戈壁中，过了几十里，又冒出地面，流经迪化市区。它的下流又全被大戈壁所吞没，只在迪化市区的中间一段，两岸居民靠着从石子中间流溢出来的河水，灌溉着自己很少量的田园。正因为缺少水利灌溉，这儿仅有六万亩耕地，而迪化市约十万人口所需的食粮，大部分要从南疆和伊犁等地远道运来，如何获得丰裕、便宜的粮食，这是迪化人民多少年来渴望解决而一直没有解决的问题。
    解放后，中央人民政府特别关心新疆少数民族地区的这一水利事业，先后拨小麦二千八百万斤，决定把红雁池重新修成一座大型的蓄水库。经过水利工程人员的勘察设计，在红雁池以南修一道五公里长的引水渠，经过引水渠把冬季不用的乌鲁木齐河水和夏季的一部分山洪引进蓄水库来，在红雁池以北，修一道三十公里长的和平渠，大量蓄水从渠内输送到青格达湖和迪化集体农庄一带的灌溉区。从一九五零年九月起，到今年二月底，经过两年六个月，驻新疆的人民解放军和各族民工费了近百万人工，终于把它修成。五月起已经开始放水，灌溉着天山北麓大戈壁边缘新开垦的大量农田。
    为了照顾夏秋两季农田用水，红雁池水库工程多是在冬季进行的。在工地用毡子和席子搭成的工棚里，要生起炉火、点起汽灯、夜以继日地紧张进行。工程上所用的沙子、石块和水泥都必须用火烤才能使用。战士们冒着风雪，在那陡峻的山坡上修凿引水渠，渠道往往被冰雪淤塞，有溃溢的危险，他们马上就跳到几尺深的河水里去破冰拨雪，使渠道畅流起来；当他们跳出来的时候，衣服冻成硬壳，皮肉冻成紫色。当修水闸涵洞时，上面的土层常容易塌下来，有砸死，砸伤人的危险，这时党的支部就提出号召：“要用战斗的精神，想法撑起木架。”大家一齐热烈响应，战士杨凤岗和大家商量后，用绳子把自己吊在涵洞半空中，钉好上面的木架。经过大家这样一连三昼夜的紧张努力，才把这个艰巨任务完成。
    红雁池除灌溉原有六万亩农田外，现在增灌到十余万亩开垦的大片耕地，据估计最低可以增产粮食一千五百万市斤。将来还有条件争取扩大到几倍，把千百年来因缺少水利灌溉而荒芜着的荒地变成更多可以耕种的良田，那时这儿就可以成为供给迪化大量食粮的一个谷仓。
