Shanxi farmers in wheat-producing areas are tensely engaged in preparations for winter wheat planting. Currently, many regions are carrying out deep plowing and land preparation. In the Yuncheng and Linfen regions, wheat fields have generally been plowed three times, and some have begun the fourth plowing. In the Changzhi region, each county has plowed once, and some have started the second plowing. Counties in the Yuci region in central Shanxi are also carrying out the work of plowing wheat fields. During the plowing process, most areas have promoted the advanced cultivation method of "shallow plowing for stubble removal the first time, deep plowing for soil turning the second time, and shallow plowing for the third and fourth times." While plowing, all regions are paying attention to using new-style walking plows. Due to the widespread teaching of the use of new-style walking plows, the promotion of these plows has also been unfolded, greatly expanding the area of deep plowing. According to statistics from 59 counties, including Jie, Xia, Anyi, Quwo, Yicheng, Ji, Wenshui, Jincheng, and Lucheng, over 1,000 new-style walking plows were sold just from early July to early August. In many regions, because farmers learned the technology of using walking plows, all the new-style walking plows that had been bought years ago but rarely used due to lack of technical knowledge were also put into use. Dongchangjing Village in Huguan County organized the masses to visit a comparative experiment using new and old plows, and the next day, all nine walking plows in the village were put to the fields. Before planting wheat, farmers in various regions also accumulated and purchased large quantities of fertilizer. According to statistics from 75 counties, including Xia, Huo, etc., 5.6 million jin of soybean cake, miscellaneous cake, black beans, bone meal, etc., were sold just from August 1st to 10th. In addition, farmers in various regions launched fertilizer accumulation campaigns based on local conditions, such as cutting grass for composting, pressing green manure, making compost, and sweeping soil from roads. Many regions also paid attention to the issue of selecting fine varieties. For example, most areas in the Changzhi region not only emphasized the quantity of improved wheat varieties but also paid attention to the quality of the seeds. These seeds were selected using methods such as ear selection, piece selection, and field selection during this year's wheat harvest. In order to ensure full seedlings and full ridges of wheat, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government also notified agricultural farms in various regions to do germination tests on wheat seeds in frost-affected areas, to prevent the disaster areas from suffering losses due to lack of seedlings or no seedlings due to frost damage to the wheat seeds.

    山西农民紧张进行种麦准备工作
    山西省产麦区广大农民紧张进行冬小麦播种准备工作。目前许多地区都在进行深耕整地。运城、临汾等专区的麦地，已普遍犁过三遍，有的已经开始四犁；长治专区各县已经犁过一遍，有的开始二犁；山西中部榆次专区各县也在进行耕翻麦地的工作。在犁麦地工作中，大部地区推广了“第一次浅犁灭茬，第二次深耕翻土，第三、四次浅耕”的先进耕作法。在耕地时，各地都注意使用新式步犁。由于广泛传授了新式步犁使用方法，所以新式步犁的推广工作，也随之展开，使深耕面积大大扩大。据解县、夏县、安邑、曲沃、翼城、吉县、文水、晋城、潞城等五十九县统计，只在七月初到八月上旬就推销新式步犁一千多部；许多地区由于农民学会了使用步犁的技术，把数年前已经买下但因不懂技术而很少用的新式步犁，也全部用上了。壶关东长井村用新旧犁对比试验的方法，组织群众参观，第二天全村九部步犁就全上了地。各地农民在种麦前还大量积肥、购肥。据夏县、霍县等七十五个县统计，只八月一日至十日就推销豆饼、杂饼、黑豆、骨粉等五百六十万斤，此外，各地农民根据当地条件展开了割草沤肥、压绿肥、做堆肥、扫道土等积肥运动。不少地区并注意了挑选优良品种的问题。如长治专区大部地区不但重视小麦优种的数量，而且注意了种籽的质量。这些种籽都是在今年收麦时用穗选、片选、场选等方法选出来的。山西省人民政府为保证小麦全苗全垄，并通知各地农场做好冻灾区小麦种籽发芽试验工作，以防止灾区因麦种受冻影响发芽，而遭受缺苗或不出苗的损失。    （郭石）
