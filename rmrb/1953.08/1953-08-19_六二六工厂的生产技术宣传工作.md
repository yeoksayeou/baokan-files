    Propaganda Department of the Party Committee of the 626 Factory
    The Party branch secretary of the fourth workshop of the 626 Factory, when talking to workers about the importance of improving production technology, was once told by worker Li Xiankui: "The principles you talk about are quite right, but you haven't talked about any production technology issues." Paying attention to the propaganda of production technology has special significance in this factory. Young workers account for 80 percent of the total number of workers in the factory, and these young workers are generally unskilled and have low technical levels. Therefore, improving technology is everyone's urgent demand. These situations aroused the attention of the Party Committee of the 626 Factory; but some people also said: "Isn't production technology propaganda just production propaganda? It has already been done in the past." Others said: "The Party mainly conducts political propaganda, and emphasizing production technology propaganda is inappropriate." In order to strengthen the propaganda work on production technology, the Party Committee of the 626 Factory held two enlarged meetings of cadres, specifically studied relevant documents on strengthening production technology propaganda, and examined the erroneous thinking of not paying attention to production technology propaganda. Then, a meeting of propaganda cadres was held to further implement the spirit of the enlarged cadre meeting. In addition, key members among the propagandists were trained intensively in their spare time, and the significance of carrying out production technology propaganda in the country's economic construction was repeatedly explained to the propagandists. Finally, the past experiences in publicizing production technology were summarized and promoted. This study laid a good foundation for strengthening production technology propaganda work.

    Summarize and promote advanced experience to universally improve technical level
    Strengthening the propaganda of product quality and technical safety is one of the important contents of production technology propaganda. In the first quarter of this year, the 626 Factory experienced a general decline in product quality, an increase in returned products, an increase in reject rates, and some employees neglecting operating procedures due to rush tasks, resulting in continuous accidents. Based on these situations, the Party Committee of the 626 Factory called on propagandists to go deep among the workers to discover and solve problems. The production team of the seventh workshop propagandist Wang Jinsheng found that the main reason for the low product quality and the 30 percent return rate was that some employees only cared about quantity and ignored quality in the production competition; at the same time, because there were many young workers with low technical levels; and there was a lack of mutual connection during operation, each person did not understand the procedures operated by others, so that once there was a work stoppage, others could not replace the operation, thus creating "big belly disease" (work piled up) and disrupting the flow of operations. In response to these situations, the branch conducted education on quality first, and the propagandist Wang Jinsheng assisted the production team leader in leading everyone to conduct three technical mutual assistance learning sessions during spare time each week. That is, every Wednesday, each procedure elects an advanced producer to perform practical demonstrations, and then everyone exchanges operations. On Thursdays, each operates his or her original procedure, and advanced producers in the same procedure perform practical demonstrations, and then everyone learns by comparing their own operating techniques. On Saturdays, the same procedures are concentrated together, and each person is given the same amount of work to operate, and the old workers provide practical guidance on the side and make technical records, and finally jointly evaluate to find out the common characteristics of each person, and use Kovalev's working method to synthesize the advanced operating methods of the procedure. The result of the study greatly improved the workers' technical level, thus ensuring the quality of the product, and the return rate dropped from 30 percent in the past to 17 percent, and the production task was overfulfilled in March.

    After discovering and summarizing this working method of the seventh workshop, the Party Committee requested all the propagandists in the factory to study this working method to strengthen the propaganda of production technology.

    The Party Committee also realized in summarizing the experience of the seventh workshop that it was not enough to strengthen the propaganda of production technology in this way. It was also necessary to publicize and promote various advanced experiences, especially the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, to continuously improve the technical level of workers and better complete the national production plan. Therefore, through advanced producer schools, technical performances, technical exchange meetings and other forms, the Soviet reflective furnace, spot welding method and Guan Baoxiang's "fast cutting", Chen Youyu's "four fast", Zhu Zonglun's "firing method" and other advanced experiences were publicized and promoted to the workers. In the propaganda, it was generally achieved to combine the key production problems of the workshop and carry out patient propaganda and education in light of the different ideological conditions of the employees. The forging workshop branch carried out publicity based on the key issues of the workshop. The workers in this workshop do not operate a machine individually, but work together on one furnace. If everyone is not united and acts at different speeds, it will affect the completion of the production task of the whole group; however, this workshop lacks cooperation, thus affecting the completion of the production task. According to this situation, the branch decided to promote the working method of the "four-in-one hand" of Sun Yucheng's production team in this group. When publicizing and promoting this experience, the branch first convened a general meeting of party members and members of the Communist Youth League to introduce this experience, and called on party members and members of the Communist Youth League to lead the masses to learn this experience; in the study, they should understand the ideological conditions of the masses and solve problems in light of the ideological conditions of the masses. At first, the masses' thinking about learning this experience was chaotic. Old worker Si Changfu said: "Sun Yucheng's group are just little kids who have been born for a few days, what experience do they have that is worth learning!" Young worker Liu Fu said: "What's so special about Sun Yucheng's experience, if our group had a good fire starter, we would surely be able to create advanced experience!" Some people even said: "There is no advanced experience in the blacksmith shop, it's really nonsense." In response to the above ideological conditions, the characteristics of Sun Yucheng's "four-in-one hand" operation method--the coordinated actions of fitter, old hammer worker, fire worker, and hammer opener were first introduced on the workshop blackboard newspaper;

    Then the trade union convened a staff meeting where the workers of the Sun Yucheng group made typical reports and held practical performances. After listening to the reports and watching the performances, the workers said enviously: "This experience is really good! We have to learn it well." Wang Jingyun said: "You can't disagree, people are doing it brilliantly." The branch also talked to old workers individually. After extensive and in-depth publicity, the vast majority of workers had a correct understanding of Sun Yucheng group's "four-in-one hand" experience, and adopted this experience in the operation process, improving their operation methods.

    Patiently educate backward workers to improve their awareness and skills
    There is still a small part of workers who do not pay attention to the study of production technology, which affects the comprehensive and balanced completion of the national production plan. The Party Committee of the factory studied how to enable these workers to learn technology and improve technology like other workers and complete production tasks. At first, a simple working method was adopted, and all the so-called backward workers in the factory were gathered together for regular education. As a result, not only did it not achieve the purpose of improving class consciousness, but it increased the ideological concerns of these workers and opposed the leadership. After accepting this lesson, the Party Committee changed to using individual education methods. For example, Du Hualing in the tool workshop is an old worker with more than 20 years of work experience, and his production has always been unenthusiastic and lags behind other workers. After discovering this, the propagandist made friends with Du Hualing and learned about Du Hualing's ideological situation. He used the fact that Du Hualing's living standards were gradually improving to explain the future of the working class to him, and used simple examples to explain the consistency of personal interests and national interests. When the branch held a meeting of propagandists, it also absorbed Du Hualing to participate; especially when he made slight achievements in production, he was promptly praised and encouraged. As a result, Du Hualing was very moved. He said: "I used to think that the branch and colleagues thought I was a backward element, the more I thought about it, the less energetic I became, so I embraced the 'go with the flow' approach; now, upon inspection, this is very wrong." Since then, Du Hualing has worked hard and continuously improved four sets of tools, and also helped three young workers learn the technology. Another example is Zhang Chunhai, a young worker in the second workshop, whose daily output dropped from 700 to 500 when production was tight. When the branch committee studied this problem, some people said: "What ideological problem does Zhang Chunhai have, he is just backward!" Branch committee member Fu Runzi disagreed with this view. The branch arranged for Zhao Lizhong, a propagandist who was often close to Zhang Chunhai, to go deep into understanding the situation. As a result, Zhang Chunhai had the following matter: Zhou Wenbin introduced Zhang Chunhai to a partner a month ago. There was no problem at the beginning of the engagement, but now the woman's mother wants to raise "bride price". Zhang Chunhai thought that he had not reported this matter to the Communist Youth League branch earlier, fearing that he would be expelled from the Communist Youth League if he spoke out at this time. After learning about this situation, the Party branch gave an explanation and education in response to Zhang Chunhai's ideological concerns. The next day, the person in charge of the workshop's party personally visited the woman's family to publicize the Marriage Law and satisfactorily resolved Zhang Chunhai's marriage problem. Since then, Zhang Chunhai has been actively producing and his production efficiency has continued to improve. He said happily: "If there is any problem in the future, I have to report it to the organization earlier."

    The transformation process of the above-mentioned so-called backward workers after education proves that the so-called backwardness of each worker has its own ideological roots. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the roots of their backwardness, so as to prescribe the right medicine, and carry out patient and repeated persuasion and education, and help them improve their skills. Only by doing so will they be able to dispel their ideological concerns, strive to improve their skills, and actively produce. On the contrary, it is wrong to adopt any simple, rigid, or even rude attitude and method towards them.

    Production technology propaganda and political propaganda are combined
    The production technology propaganda in each workshop is closely combined with political propaganda. One way to combine is to publicize the advanced ideology of advanced figures while publicizing advanced experience, and use the specific and vivid ideology of the masters to educate all workers. Many advanced workers introduced the pain they suffered in the old society, and how they actively learn advanced technology, how they actively improve their production technology, how they actively create advanced experience, how they actively improve production to support the front, and how they actively participate in factory management after becoming the masters of the country.... These have played a great role in improving the class consciousness and political awareness of all employees. For example, after listening to the introduction of advanced ideology by Xiang Hongen, an advanced producer in the fourth workshop, young worker Wang Kuixiang said with emotion: "Master Xiang regards the factory as his own home, and has never produced defective products since he started production. When the dormitory caught fire, he desperately rescued it. When his eyes were damaged, he not only did not complain, but instead said: 'We are the masters of the country, as long as the fire is put out, it is a small matter to damage personal eyes.' Comparing it with our thinking is too embarrassing. In order to earn more wages, we only focus on quantity in production, regardless of quality, resulting in a lot of defective products, causing great losses to the country. In the future, we must learn from Master Xiang's advanced thinking, actively produce, improve technology, improve product quality, so that our country can be industrialized as soon as possible." On the other hand, attention should be paid to grasping the current major political events; such as the propaganda of the three major tasks, the general election work, the activities of various commemorative festivals, and the study of the heroic deeds of the Volunteers, etc., to continuously improve the workers' awareness.

    Several better forms and methods of carrying out production technology propaganda
    The 626 Factory has created the following better propaganda forms and methods:

    One is the advanced producer school. This form learned from the experience of the Soviet Stakhanov School, using the evening spare time, please invite workers in the workshop who are technically high and consistently maintain product quality and complete production tasks ahead of schedule, especially those who have created advanced experience, to spread advanced experience and advanced ideas to the workshop workers through lectures and practical performances. The participation of each worker is voluntary. They call this kind of education method the advanced producer school. Now, each workshop branch in the factory has held such a school, and 256 students have officially graduated.

    Another is the comprehensive advanced experience propaganda group. It is to synthesize piecemeal experience into systematic experience and spread it to the workers. For example, the comprehensive advanced experience propaganda group in the fourth workshop went to the ninth section in March under the leadership of the branch to conduct actual investigations; as a result, it was found that each worker in this section had different advantages in their operation methods: Xu Zhifang retracted the knife quickly during operation, Sha Zhenjiang dug quickly, and Guo Guiwen ate the knife quickly. The propaganda group combined these advantages with the advanced experience of Guan Baoxiang and Chen Youyu, advanced producers in the workshop, into the multi-knife, multi-blade, multi-digging, and multi-machine rapid cutting method. After promotion in this section, the production efficiency of the entire section quickly improved.

    In addition, there are more than 20 propaganda methods such as technical safety speeches, red flag projects, production evenings, glory list, and red flag competition. These propaganda methods have been warmly welcomed by the workers when conducting propaganda activities.

    Strengthening production technology propaganda is a new issue for the Party's propaganda network organization. Many propagandists, especially young workers and employees, have many difficulties in their work because of their low technical level or lack of technical knowledge. After discovering these problems, the Party Committee of the 626 Factory took effective measures to overcome these difficulties. They first organized young workers and employees as propagandists to participate in technical night school learning; and required them to learn, use, and publicize as they learned. Or organize propagandists with production technology to impart knowledge to propagandists without technology or low technology. Secondly, absorb old workers and technicians who have the conditions to become propagandists as propagandists. Usually, when conducting technical propaganda, attention is also paid to absorbing non-propagandists with technical knowledge to participate in the technical propaganda team. This not only increased the strength of technical propaganda, gave play to the role of the Party's propaganda network in serving production, but also made the connection between the Party and the masses closer because the propagandists played a significant role in production and provided sincere help to the workers. For example, Zhao Dexi, a propagandist in the fourth workshop, was warmly welcomed by young workers; sometimes young workers even went to his home to learn technology. Through production technology propaganda, the level of the propaganda network has been greatly improved. However, we must continue to work hard in the future to comprehensively and frequently carry out mass production technology propaganda work.

    六二六工厂的生产技术宣传工作
    中共黑龙江省委宣传部宣传鼓动处
    六二六工厂党委宣传部
    六二六工厂第四车间的党支部书记，有一次向工人讲提高生产技术的重要性时，工人李宪魁说：“道理讲的倒是挺对，就是没有讲些生产技术问题。”在这个厂里注意生产技术的宣传是有其特殊意义的。全厂青年工人占了工人总数的百分之八十，而这些青年工人一般是操作不熟练，技术水平低，因此提高技术是大家迫切的要求。这些情况，引起了六二六厂党委的注意；但也有人说：“生产技术宣传不就是生产宣传？过去早已作过了。”也有人说：“党主要是进行政治宣传，强调生产技术的宣传是不妥的。”为了加强对生产技术的宣传工作，六二六工厂的党委召开了两次干部扩大会议，专门学习了有关加强生产技术宣传的文件，并检查了不重视生产技术宣传的错误思想。接着又召开了宣传干部会议，进一步贯彻了扩大干部会议的精神。又利用业余时间集训了宣传员中的骨干分子，在宣传员中反复地讲解了在国家经济建设中进行生产技术宣传的意义。最后，总结了过去宣传生产技术方面的经验，加以推广。这一学习，给加强生产技术的宣传工作作了良好的开始。
    总结和推广先进经验，普遍提高技术水平
    加强产品质量和技术安全的宣传，是进行生产技术宣传的重要内容之一。六二六厂在今年第一季度曾发生产品质量普遍下降，退修品增多，废品率上升，部分职工因突击任务而忽视操作规程，致使事故不断发生的情况。六二六厂的党委根据这些情况，号召宣传员深入工人中去发现问题和解决问题。第七车间宣传员王金生所在的生产小组中就检查出了产品质量不高、退修品占百分之三十的主要原因，是由于部分职工在生产竞赛中只顾数量忽视了质量；同时因为年青工人多，技术水平低；在操作时又缺乏相互联系，每人操作的工序互不了解，一旦遇有歇工情况，别人就不能代替操作，这样就出现了“大肚子病”（活积压在一起），打乱了流水作业。支部针对这些情况，一面进行质量第一的教育，一面由宣传员王金生协助生产小组长领导大家每周进行三次技术业余互助学习。这就是在每星期三由各道工序推选一名生产先进者进行实际表演，然后大家交换操作。星期四各操作自己的原道工序，由同道先进生产者进行实际表演，然后由大家对照自己的操作技术进行学习。星期六是同道工序集中一起，每人分给同样数量的活计进行操作，老工人在一旁实际指导，并作技术记录，最后共同评议，找出每个人的共同特点，运用郭瓦廖夫的工作方法综合出本道的先进的操作方法。学习的结果，大大地提高了工人的技术水平，从而保证了产品的质量，退修率由过去的百分之三十降低到百分之十七，三月份并超额完成了生产任务。
    党委会在发现和总结了第七车间这一工作方法后，即要求全厂宣传员都来学习这一工作方法，以加强生产技术的宣传。
    党委会在总结第七车间的经验中同时发觉仅是这样加强生产技术的宣传是不够的，还必须宣传与推广各种先进经验，特别是苏联的先进经验，才能不断地提高工人的技术水平，更好地完成国家生产计划。于是通过先进生产者学校、技术表演、技术交流会等形式，向工人宣传和推广了苏联的反射炉、点焊法和本厂出现的关宝祥的“快速切削”、陈有裕的“四快”、朱宗伦的“烧火法”等先进经验。在宣传中一般都做到了结合本车间的生产关键问题，针对职工各种不同的思想情况，进行耐心的宣传教育。锻造车间支部就是根据本车间的关键问题进行宣传的。这个车间的工人不是每人单独操纵一架机器，而是共同在一个炉上进行工作，如果大家不团结，行动有快慢，就会影响到全组生产任务的完成；可是这个车间恰恰存在着不能协同动作的情形，因此影响了生产任务的完成。根据这个情况，支部就决定在这个组宣传孙玉成生产小组的“四合手”的工作法。支部在宣传与推广这一经验时，首先召开了全车间党员团员大会介绍了这一经验，并号召党员团员要带领群众学习这一经验；在学习中，要了解群众的思想情况，针对群众的思想情况解决问题。起初，群众对学习这一经验的思想是较混乱的，老工人司长富说：“孙玉成组都是出世不过几天的小毛孩子，他们有啥经验值得咱学的！”青年工人刘福说：“孙玉成的经验有啥稀奇，咱组要有个好烧火的，保险也能创造出先进经验来！”甚至有人说：“铁匠房就没有什么先进经验，真是瞎胡闹。”针对上述思想情况，首先将孙玉成“四合手”操作法的特点——钳工、老锤工、烧火工、开锤工
    四种工序的协同动作，在车间黑板报上作了介绍；
    接着通过工会召开了职工大会，由孙玉成组的工人
    在大会上作典型报告，并举行实际表演。工人们在
    听过报告看过表演后纷纷羡慕说：“这个经验真好
    啊！可得好好学习了。”王景云说：“不服气可不
    行，人家干的就是高明。”支部还找老工人进行个别
    谈话。经过广泛深入的宣传后，绝大多数工人对孙玉成组的“四合手”经验有了正确的认识，并在操作过程中采用了这个经验，改进了自己的操作方法。
    耐心教育落后工人，提高他们的觉悟和技术
    在工人中还有一小部分工人根本不重视生产技术的学习，影响了全面地均衡地完成国家生产计划。该厂党委就研究如何使这些工人和其他工人一样地学习技术提高技术，完成生产任务。起初，采用了简单的工作方式，将全厂所谓落后工人集中在一起进行定期教育的作法。结果，不但没有达到提高阶级觉悟的目的，反而增加了这些工人的思想顾虑，并与领导对立起来。党委在接受了这一教训后，改用个别教育的方法。如工具车间的杜华令是个有二十多年工龄的老工人，生产一贯不积极，落后于其他工人。宣传员发现后，就用交朋友的方法和杜华令交了朋友，了解了杜华令的思想情况后，就用杜华令本身生活水平日渐提高的事实，向他说明了工人阶级的前途，又用浅显的例子讲解了个人利益和国家利益的一致性。支部召开宣传员会时，又吸收杜华令参加；特别是当他在生产中稍有成绩时，及时进行表扬鼓励。这样作的结果，杜华令很受感动。他说：“咱以前寻思支部和工友都认为咱是落后分子，越想越带不起劲来，就抱着‘顺大流’的作法；现在检查起来，这是很不对的。”此后杜华令苦心钻研，连续改进了四套工具，还帮助三名青年工人学会了技术。又如第二车间青年工人张春海，正当生产紧张的时候，日产量却由七百降低到五百。支委会在研究这个问题的时候，有人说：“张春海有啥思想问题，就是落后呗！”支部委员傅润滋不同意这种看法。支部就布置了和张春海经常接近的宣传员赵立忠深入了解情况。结果发现了张春海有这样一件事情：在一个月以前，周文彬给张春海介绍了一个对象，开始订婚时啥问题也没有，现在女方的母亲却要起“财礼”来了。这件事张春海认为没有及早向团支部进行汇报，怕这时讲出来要开除团籍。党支部了解了这个情况后，即针对张春海的思想顾虑进行了解释教育。第二天车间党的负责人亲自到女方家去进行访问，宣传了婚姻法，圆满地解决了张春海的婚姻问题。从此张春海积极生产，生产效率不断地提高。他高兴地说：“今后有啥问题，可得早点向组织汇报了。”
    以上几个所谓落后工人经过教育后的转变过程证明：每个工人的所谓落后都是有其一定的思想根源的。因此要了解他们落后的根子，从而对症下药，进行耐心的反复的说服教育，并帮助他们提高技术。只有这样做，他们才会解除思想顾虑，努力提高技术，积极生产。相反地，对他们采取任何简单生硬甚至粗暴的态度和方法都是错误的。
    生产技术宣传和政治宣传相结合进行
    各个车间的生产技术宣传密切地结合了政治宣传。结合的方法一方面是在宣传先进经验时，同时宣传先进人物的先进思想，用具体的活生生的主人翁的思想来教育全体工人。许多先进工人介绍了自己在旧社会所受的痛苦，今天成为国家主人后，怎样积极学习先进技术，怎样积极提高自己的生产技术，怎样积极创造先进经验，怎样积极提高生产支援前方，怎样积极参加管理工厂……。这些对提高全体职工的阶级觉悟和政治认识是起了很大作用的。如第四车间青年工人王奎祥在听过生产先进者项洪恩介绍先进思想后，感动地说：“项师傅把工厂当成自己的家，生产以来没出过废品。宿舍失火了，他奋不顾身地抢救。把眼睛碰坏了，他不仅没有埋怨，相反地却说：‘咱是国家的主人，只要把火扑灭了，损毁了个人的眼睛是小事。’对照一下咱的思想可太惭愧了。咱为了多挣工资，生产只图数量，不顾质量，结果出了很多废品，给国家造成了很大的损失。今后一定要好好学习项师傅的先进思想，积极生产，提高技术，提高产品质量，使我们国家早日工业化。”另一方面，注意抓住了当前各项重大的政治事件；例如三大任务的宣传、普选工作、各个纪念节日的活动、学习志愿军英勇事迹等等，以不断地提高工人的觉悟。
    进行生产技术宣传的几种较好的形式和方法
    六二六厂创造了以下几种较好的宣传形式和方法：
    一种是先进生产者学校。这种形式是学习了苏联斯大哈诺夫学校的经验，利用夜晚业余时间，请本车间技术较高和一贯保持产品质量和提前完成生产任务的，特别是创造过先进经验的工人，通过讲授和实际表演等示范形式，向车间工人群众传播先进经验和先进思想。每个工人的参加都是自愿的。他们把这样的教育方法叫做先进生产者学校。现在全厂各个车间支部都举办了这样的学校，已经正式毕业的学员有二百五十六名。
    另一种是综合先进经验宣传小组。它是把点滴经验综合为系统经验，向工人群众进行传播。如第四车间综合先进经验宣传小组，三月份，在支部领导下，深入第九工段进行实际考察；结果发现这个段的每个工人的操作法各有不同的优点：徐志方操作时退刀快，沙振江掏活快，郭桂文吃刀快。宣传组就把这些优点和本车间的先进生产者关宝祥、陈有裕的先进经验综合为多刀、多刃、多掏、多机台快速切削法。在本段推广后，全段生产效率迅速地提高。
    此外还有技术安全讲话、抢红旗课题、生产晚会以及光荣榜、红旗竞赛等二十余种宣传方式方法。这些宣传的方式方法，在进行宣传活动时，都受到了工人的热烈欢迎。
    加强生产技术宣传对党的宣传网组织来讲是个新问题。许多宣传员，尤其是青年工人和职员中的宣传员，因为他们技术水平低，或者不懂技术，工作中的困难就很多。六二六厂党委会在发现了这些问题后，采取了有效的办法来克服这些困难。他们首先组织了青年工人和职员中的宣传员参加技术夜校学习；并要求他们做到随学、随用、随宣传。或者将有生产技术的宣传员组织起来对没有技术或技术低的宣传员进行传授。其次从老工人和技术员中吸收具备宣传员条件的为宣传员。平时进行技术宣传时，也注意吸收有技术的非宣传员参加技术宣传的队伍。这样不仅增加了技术宣传的力量，发挥了党的宣传网为生产服务的作用，而且由于宣传员在生产中发挥了显著的作用，对工人群众进行了恳切的帮助，从而使党与群众的联系更加密切了。如第四车间宣传员赵德喜受到了青年工人们的热烈欢迎；有时青年工人们还到他家里去学习技术。通过生产技术宣传，大大地提高了宣传网的水平。但是，今后仍须继续努力，以求全面地经常地开展群众性的生产技术宣传工作。
