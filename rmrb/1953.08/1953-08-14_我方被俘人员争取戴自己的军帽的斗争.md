Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 12th: Since the exchange of prisoners of war began on August 5th, returned Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war wearing Volunteer Army military caps or octagonal caps, and Korean People's Army prisoners of war wearing People's Army military caps can be seen daily in our handover zone. This is a victory won with life and blood by our captured personnel under the US side's reign of terror.

    The struggle to win the right to wear one's own cap was also a very fierce one. The Americans repeatedly ordered that prisoners of war were not allowed to wear their own caps, and they also confiscated them by force. But when the old caps were taken away, new ones appeared again.

    On the morning of March 7, 1952, inside the No. 1 prisoner-of-war camp on Longcao Island, the enemy suddenly used a seemingly gentle tone to say to the more than 1,700 Korean People's Army prisoners of war in the camp: "Now the Allied forces allow you to wear your own caps, but you must cut off the brims and are not allowed to wear the cap badges." This was clearly a personal insult to the prisoners of war in violation of the Geneva Convention. Everyone was very angry when they heard these words. At that time, more than 20 people reasoned with the enemy and firmly stated that the glorious People's Army military cap could not be desecrated by the enemy. The Americans became enraged and mobilized more than 1,500 fully armed troops to surround the prisoner-of-war camp, layer upon layer, and brought in vehicles that sprayed poisonous gas, opening fire on our captured personnel. Forty-eight of our captured personnel were killed on the spot, 89 were seriously injured, and hundreds were slightly injured. In another prisoner-of-war camp, 27 of our captured personnel were also killed by the enemy for fighting for the right to wear their own caps. Due to the resolute struggle of our captured personnel, the US prisoner-of-war camp authorities finally had to agree to the reasonable request of our captured personnel to wear their own caps.

    It was not easy to make a cap in the enemy's prisoner-of-war camp. In addition to the enemy's persecution, all raw materials and tools had to be found by oneself. The cloth was torn from clothing. The needle was made by grinding a thin piece of wire that had been picked up; it would take several days just to make an eye for the needle. The thread was unraveled from broken socks or shoelaces. Without scissors, one could only use a steel strip from the inner sole of a broken leather shoe, ground into a small knife. The cardboard lining for the cap brim was made from cigarette wrapping paper, secretly picked up from the garbage dump while doing hard labor outside.

    However, the most difficult thing to make was the cap badge on the People's Army military cap. Initially, everyone simply cut out cap flowers from tin can scraps, some biting their fingers and smearing fresh blood on the five-pointed star; others tried to find a little red paint to apply. After August 15, 1952, in many prisoner-of-war camps, our captured personnel made them collectively. They melted down tin or copper bowls used for eating and poured the molten metal into cap badge molds carved in stone. Even doing it this way was still very difficult. Often, dozens of people worked tensely all night and could only cast less than a hundred cap badges. However, the five-pointed star cap badges, made by this method and painted red, were all the same size and very beautiful. In those tragic days, it was a symbol of victory, it had encouraged the fighting will of the captured personnel and strengthened their confidence in regaining freedom.

### 我方被俘人员争取戴自己的军帽的斗争

    我方被俘人员争取戴自己的军帽的斗争
    【新华社开城十二日电】从八月五日双方开始遣返战俘以来，在我方交接区每天都可以看见归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员戴着志愿军的军帽或八角帽，朝鲜人民军的被俘人员戴着人民军的军帽。这是我方被俘人员在美方恐怖统治下用生命和鲜血换来的胜利。
    争取戴自己的帽子的权利，也是一场十分激烈的斗争。美国人曾经多次下令不准被俘人员戴自己的帽子，也用武力没收过。可是旧的帽子拿走了，新的又出现了。
        一九五二年三月七日早晨，在龙草岛第一战俘营内，敌人忽然用假装温和的口吻向战俘营中的一千七百多名朝鲜人民军被俘人员说：“现在联军允许你们戴自己的帽子，但是要把帽沿剪掉，不准戴帽徽。”这显然是违反日内瓦公约的对战俘的人身侮辱。大家听到这些话以后，非常气愤，当时就有二十几个人跟敌人说理，并坚决表示光荣的人民军军帽是不能容许敌人玷辱的。美国人恼羞成怒，调动了全付武装的军队一千五百多人，把战俘营层层包围，并开来了喷射毒气的汽车，向我方被俘人员开火。我方被俘人员四十八人当场牺牲，八十九人重伤，数百人轻伤。在另一个战俘收容所里，我方被俘人员为了争取戴自己的帽子的权利，也被敌人杀害了二十七人。由于我方被俘人员的坚决斗争，美国战俘营当局终于不得不答应我方被俘人员戴自己帽子的合理要求。
    在敌人战俘营里做一顶帽子是很不容易的。除了敌人的迫害以外，一切原料和工具都要自己设法解决。布，是从衣服上撕下来的。针，是用拣来的细铁丝磨成的，为了打一个针眼，就要化上几天的时间。线，是从破袜子或鞋带上拆下来的。没有剪刀，只能拿破皮鞋底里垫的钢条磨成小刀代用。衬帽沿的硬纸板是用出外做苦工时悄悄从垃圾堆中拾来的包烟纸做成的。
    然而，最难做的还是人民军军帽上的帽徽。最初，各人只是用罐头盒的铁片剪成帽花，有的咬破手指，把鲜血涂在五角星上；有的设法找到少许红漆涂上去。一九五二年八月十五日以后，在许多战俘收容所中，我方被俘人员都集体来做。他们把吃饭用的锡碗或铜碗熔化后，倒进刻在石头上的帽徽模型里。即使这样做也还是很困难的，常常几十个人紧张地工作一个通宵，只能铸成不到一百个帽徽。然而，经过这种方法做出来的涂成红色的五角星的帽徽，都同样大小，十分漂亮。在那些悲惨的日子里，它就是胜利的象征，它曾经鼓舞了被俘人员们的斗争意志，坚定了他们重获自由的信心。
