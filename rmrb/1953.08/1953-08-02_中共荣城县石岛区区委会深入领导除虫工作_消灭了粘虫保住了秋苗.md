The CCP Rongcheng County Shidao District Committee Deeply Leads Pest Control Work: Eliminating Armyworms and Protecting Autumn Seedlings

In early June, a batch of armyworms appeared in the wheat fields of Shidao District, Rongcheng County, Shandong. When the masses were working to eliminate them, these armyworms were almost at the pupation stage. Therefore, the pest control work did not take much effort, and the worms went down. Based on the fact that some armyworms had entered the soil to pupate and that this pest can reproduce several generations in one summer, the leading cadres of the District Committee judged that this pest was likely to occur in large numbers during the summer harvest. Therefore, they prepared ideologically. After the summer harvest arrived, the District Committee made specific arrangements for checking for pests, requiring cadres to conduct in-depth inspections to see if armyworms were occurring while leading the masses in the summer harvest. After in-depth inspection, it was indeed found that there were widespread armyworm larvae that had recently hatched in the wheat fields. In some fields, the armyworms were very dense, with more than twenty on every square foot.

However, it was the summer harvest season at that time. Some farmers were busy harvesting wheat and couldn't spare time for pest control, and some farmers wanted to harvest wheat and control pests, but they couldn't do both. In response to this situation, the District Committee first mobilized cadres to publicize to the masses, telling them: Now that it is continuous rainy weather, failure to harvest wheat quickly will result in losses, but only focusing on harvesting wheat and not controlling pests will mean the autumn seedlings cannot be protected once the worms spread. The masses originally knew the seriousness of armyworms harming autumn crops. After this publicity, everyone quickly proposed many methods to balance the summer harvest and pest control. For example: rationally dividing labor to carry out wheat harvesting and pest control separately, digging blockade ditches around the wheat fields to first prevent the worms from spreading outwards, and concentrating on eliminating them after the wheat harvest is complete. In this way, the farmers in Shidao District harvested their wheat, eliminated the armyworms, and protected the autumn seedlings of crops such as corn and millet.

    中共荣城县石岛区区委会深入领导除虫工作
    消灭了粘虫保住了秋苗
    六月初，山东荣城县石岛区麦地里发生了一批粘虫。这批粘虫在群众除治时已快到化蛹时期，因此，除治工作没费多大劲，虫子就下去了。该区区委会的领导干部根据部分粘虫入土化蛹和这种害虫一夏天能繁殖几代等情况，判断这种害虫在夏收时还有大量发生的可能。因此在思想上做了准备。在夏收到来以后，区委会作了检查害虫的具体布置，要求干部在领导群众夏收时，深入检查有没有粘虫发生。经过深入检查，果然发现麦田里普遍有孵化不久的粘虫幼虫。有些地里的粘虫很密，每平方尺就有二十多条。
    但当时正是夏收期间，有些农民忙着收麦，顾不上除虫，有些农民想收麦也想除虫，但是不能兼顾。区委会根据这一情况，首先动员干部向群众宣传，告诉他们：现在阴雨连绵，不快收麦子是要遭到损失的，可是只顾收麦不顾除虫，等虫子蔓延开，秋苗就保不住了。群众原来就知道粘虫对大秋作物为害的严重性，再经过这一宣传，大家很快就提出了许多夏收和除虫兼顾的办法。如：合理分工，分别进行收麦除虫，在麦田周围挖封锁沟先阻止住虫子向外蔓延，等麦收完毕就集中消灭等办法。就这样，石岛区的农民把麦子收割了，粘虫也除治了，保住了这里的玉米、谷子等作物的秋苗。
