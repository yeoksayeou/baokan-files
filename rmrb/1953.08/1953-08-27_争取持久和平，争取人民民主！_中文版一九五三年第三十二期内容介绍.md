The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1953, No. 32, has been published.

This issue published an editorial entitled "Youth Unity in the Struggle for Peace," discussing the great significance of the Third World Youth Congress and the Fourth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival, which were recently held successively in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. The editorial stated that the World Youth Congress and the Festival reflected new characteristics in the struggle of the world's youth to strive for their pressing demands and to realize their hopes and aspirations. They show that the democratic youth movement has reached a new and higher level. Youth in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries are resolutely intensifying their struggle for their economic, political, and social rights, and they are looking towards the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, which provide unlimited opportunities for the development of their youth. The editorial pointed out that youth is an active component of the great front of peace advocates. Young people are full of confidence in the victory of the international movement for negotiation. They are increasingly aware that the fundamental way and powerful force to realize their aspirations is unity – the fraternal alliance of youth of all countries and all strata. The prerequisite for achieving this unity is to establish the broadest cultural, sports, and other friendly ties among young people of different social components and different beliefs, and between regional, national, and international youth organizations. At the same time, since international reactionary forces are trying their best to poison and divide youth and continue to provoke peace-loving people, youth must raise their vigilance against the conspiracies of the enemies of international peace and friendship.

Under the title "The Party's New Guidelines and Tasks," this issue published an abridged version of the resolution of the 15th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held in late July. The resolution pointed out that the essence of the new policy of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany is to greatly improve the economic and political situation of the German Democratic Republic in the near future, and to substantially improve the living standards of the working class and all working people on this basis. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic must intensify their efforts to seek mutual understanding between the people of East and West Germany, so that a peace treaty with Germany can be concluded on a democratic basis as soon as possible. The resolution pointed out that in order to prevent mistakes, the system of collective leadership must be developed in all party leading organs. In all party work, it is necessary to learn more from the rich organizational and political experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union than before.

This issue also published an article written by Edward Ochab, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, entitled "Vigorously Improve the Ideological Education of the Working People." The article pointed out that the purpose of ideological work is to educate the masses with a deep spirit of patriotism and internationalism, to educate them to become conscious builders of Polish socialism, and heroic fighters for progress and world peace. Party organizations at all levels must arm themselves and the masses of working people with the immortal theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. There must be no slackening in the Party's assistance and concern for various ideological tasks. In order to make the Party's influence more militant among the masses, it is necessary to improve the level of propaganda and agitation work, improve and activate Party education, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against narrow empiricism and sectarian "leftist" behavior.

This issue also published an article by Mohammed Ennafaa, Secretary of the Tunisian Communist Party, entitled "The Tunisian People's Struggle for Freedom and National Independence." The article said: The French rulers and their lackeys in Tunisia have carried out brutal repression against the Tunisian people in the past eighteen months, attempting to crush the Tunisian national liberation movement and prop up the regime of this crumbling protectorate. However, none of their hopes have been realized. The Tunisian people responded to arrests, deportations, police terror, and "sweeps" with heroic and tenacious struggle. People of different opinions and different strata participated in the struggle. The national liberation movement has achieved genuine victories. Under the pressure of this victory, the French colonialists, who have repeatedly gone back on their words, have once again issued a call for "resuming negotiations," but the Tunisian people must be vigilant against the conspiracies of the French colonialists and clarify their true intentions. The article then cited the various demands of the Tunisian people for negotiations proposed in the statement of the Central Committee of the Tunisian Communist Party, the most basic principle of which is national independence. The article finally pointed out that in the Tunisian national liberation movement, the working class must become the foundation for uniting all forces in this movement. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第三十二期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五三年第三十二期中文版已经出版。
    本期发表了题为“青年们在争取和平的斗争中的团结”的社论，论述最近在罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特相继举行的第三届世界青年代表大会和第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的伟大意义。社论说，世界青年代表大会和联欢节反映了世界青年争取自己的迫切要求、争取实现自己的希望和抱负的斗争的新特点。它们表明民主青年运动已经达到新的更高的水平。资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的青年正在坚决地加紧争取他们的经济、政治和社会权利，他们瞩望着为自己的青年提供了无限发展机会的苏联和人民民主国家。社论指出，青年是和平拥护者的伟大阵线中的一个活跃的组成部分。青年们对于国际争取协商运动的胜利是充满信心的。他们越来越多地认识到，使自己的愿望得到实现的根本办法和强大力量就是团结——各国青年和各阶层青年的兄弟般的联盟。而达到这种团结所必须的先决条件，就是在不同社会成分和不同信念的青年中间，在区域性的、全国性的和国际性的青年组织之间，建立最广泛的文化、体育和其他的友好联系。同时，由于国际反动势力正在竭力毒害和分裂青年，并且继续对爱好和平的人民进行挑衅，青年们必须提高对国际和平友好的敌人的阴谋的警惕性。
    本期以“党的新方针和任务”为标题，摘要刊载了德国统一社会党中央委员会七月下旬举行的第十五次全体会议的决议。决议指出，德国统一社会党的新方针实质上是要使德意志民主共和国的经济和政治情况在近期内得到很大的改善，并在这一基础上相当地提高工人阶级和全体劳动人民的生活水平。德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府必须要加紧争取东、西德人民的互相谅解，使对德和约能够在民主的基础上早日缔结。决议指出，为了防止错误，必须在所有的党的领导机关内发展集体领导制。在党的全部工作中，必须比以前更多地学习苏联共产党的丰富的组织经验和政治经验。
    本期还刊载了波兰统一工人党中央委员会书记爱德华·奥哈布撰写的“大力改进对劳动人民的思想教育”一文。文章指出，思想工作的目的在于以深刻的爱国主义和国际主义精神教育群众，在于教育他们成为有觉悟的波兰社会主义建设者，以及为进步和全世界和平而斗争的英勇战士。各地党组织必须以马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的不朽学说武装自己和劳动人民群众，党对于各种思想工作的帮助和关怀，不容许有丝毫的放松。为了使党的影响在群众中更带有战斗性，必须提高宣传鼓动工作的水平，改进和活跃党的教育，向狭隘的经验主义和宗派主义的“左”倾行为作不调和的斗争。
    本期还刊载了突尼斯共产党书记穆罕默德·恩纳法的“突尼斯人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争”一文。文章说：法国统治者及其在突尼斯的走狗，在过去十八个月中对突尼斯人民进行了横暴的镇压，企图粉碎突尼斯的民族解放运动，支撑这个摇摇欲坠的保护国的政权。但是，他们的希望都没有实现。突尼斯人民用英勇顽强的斗争来回答逮捕、驱逐出境、警察恐怖和“扫荡”。参加斗争的包括不同见解、不同阶层的人们。民族解放运动获得了真正的胜利。在这种胜利的压力下，曾屡次自食其言的法国殖民者又发出“恢复谈判”的呼声，但是突尼斯人民必须警惕法国殖民者的阴谋，弄清他们的真正意图。文章接着援引了突尼斯共产党中央委员会声明中所提出的突尼斯人民关于进行谈判的各项要求，其中最基本的原则就是民族独立。文章最后指出，在突尼斯民族解放运动中，工人阶级必须成为团结这个运动的一切力量的基础。（新华社）
