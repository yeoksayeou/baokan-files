The Key to Improving the Equilibrium Rate of Machining
——A Record of the Section Operation Plan of the Second Workshop of the Northeast Machinery Factory
Lu Chaoqi

At the factory director joint conference held by the First Ministry of Machine Building in Shenyang in mid-July, many factory leaders, when discussing the issue of strengthening planning management, proved that those who had already started to compile and implement operation plans could generally organize machining according to the needs of the assembly workshop and could often maintain an assembly equilibrium rate of over 90 percent. However, they all agreed that it was most difficult to deepen the planning management into every process of machining, so that it could effectively guide every worker to produce according to plan every hour from the most basic and most complex link, thereby improving the equilibrium rate of machining and overcoming the phenomenon of crash work in the processing process. Among all the factories, only the first and fourth sections of the second workshop of the Machinery Factory No. 1—the machining workshop—have achieved this. These two sections have basically eliminated the phenomenon of crash work. The machining equilibrium rate of the fourth section reached 91 percent in the first cycle (early ten days) of June, 93 percent in the second cycle (mid-ten days), and 100 percent in the third cycle (late ten days), and completed the plan one day ahead of schedule.

Achieving assembly equilibrium by improving the equilibrium rate of machining is a step forward in improving the level of planning management in China's machinery industry, and it is the result of doing a more in-depth job of planning management. Based on the joint section, the Second Workshop of the Machinery Factory No. 1 has been formulating operation plans according to the needs of the assembly workshop and organizing rhythmic production according to the instruction chart for more than a year. Last year and in the first quarter of this year, when producing shapers, the Second Workshop basically achieved an average weekly supply of twelve sets of parts to the assembly workshop, that is, twelve sets of components, so that the assembly equilibrium rate reached 92 percent. However, at that time, the operation plan and the organizational management work, like other machinery factories now, could only enable the workshop director and the section chief to control the progress of the components, that is, when to invest how much material and when to deliver which components; but for the hundreds or thousands of components and parts, the daily and hourly flow between processes, and whether they could complete the processing according to plan, no one knew except for a few major components. The components of machine tools produced by the Machinery Factory No. 1 every month add up to more than 390,000 processes in the processing workshop every month. Every time a component changes a process, it changes a machine tool; the time of the process varies, so the processing time of the component on various machine tools is also different. If the operation plan cannot go deep into the specific process of each component, that is, stipulate what each machine tool should do every hour; if the organizational management work cannot go deep into grasping the production of each process, then the flow of components between processes will be in a state of free flow.

The free flow of components between processes has caused confusion in the processing process. Specifically manifested in: 1. Individual workers with low awareness do not produce according to the operation plan. They first do the easy and profitable work (because it is piecework), and put the difficult and less profitable work aside. In this way, some components that should have been completed at the beginning of the month were not made, and some that should have been completed at the end of the month were completed ahead of schedule. 2. Because workers are absent or equipment malfunctions, the section chief is not easy to know when the processing of some components cannot catch up with the planned progress, and it is often discovered when it is time to put them into storage according to the plan, so he has to rely on organizing crash work to remedy it. 3. When compiling the operation plan for the next month on the 25th of each month, although the number of work-in-process products in the workshop is counted once, the estimation of the flow of work-in-process products in the last five days is often not very accurate; therefore, the operation plan for the next month does not conform to the production situation of the group. For example, some machine tools should have started processing new components according to the plan, but they are still processing the components that were not completed last month. In the above three cases, in order to supply complete sets of components to ensure the equilibrium of assembly, the processing workshop has to frequently organize crash production. 4. In order to complete the plan, the workshop director and section chief have to urge the production of various components by the machine tool every day, which takes up most of their time, so that they cannot well consider the production problems of the workshop and the section.

The Second Workshop, according to the suggestion of Soviet expert Comrade Krasavtsev, strengthened the management of the section processes from both the operation plan and the organizational management to solve this problem. This work started in June from the Fourth Section.

According to the experience of the Fourth Section, the operation plan must not only stipulate what components each group and machine tool process, and when they should deliver these components, but also stipulate the activities of each machine tool every day and every hour, in order to become the action program to guide the daily activities of the workers. In order to achieve this, the planner must go deep into the section group, investigate the existing quantity of work-in-process products, and, according to the quantity of existing components and the length of the component cycle, compile the cycle (ten days) connection operation plan with the section chief and the group leader. The requirement of this plan is to stipulate what the section and the group produce within the cycle, which machine tool is responsible for it, and when it is completed. Therefore, when formulating the operation plan, in addition to paying attention to the balance of equipment load, paying attention to placing the components with many processes and long processing time in the forefront for processing, and adopting the method of processing one kind of component with multiple machine tools first to shorten the processing time, it is also necessary to determine its processing quantity according to the capacity of each machine tool, and fix the components and processes it is responsible for, so as to avoid arbitrarily transferring tasks during the implementation of the plan and ensure that the group produces according to the operation plan.

The cycle operation plan cannot specifically guide the daily activities of the workers. To achieve this, the planner of the Fourth Section also formulates the shift (i.e., day and night shift) operation plan every day according to the cycle operation plan and the new time quota, stipulating the processing quantity and processes that each machine tool should complete within one shift (eight hours). This plan is the basis for checking the implementation of the plan, dispatching, and assigning work. It helps the section chief, the group leader, and the management personnel to grasp the daily production situation, making it possible to improve the machining equilibrium rate of the entire section.

The section must have a management organization and become a basic management unit. Previously, the management personnel of the Second Workshop were concentrated in the workshop. Since the cycle operation plan cannot guide the specific daily activities of each worker and each machine tool, the work of the management personnel in the process of plan implementation has no guidelines, the division of labor is unclear, and it has not played its due role. It can only grasp the results of plan implementation. Now, the Fourth Section has established management organizations such as planning, dispatching, engineering, and recording. Its main task is to control the process according to the shift operation plan, that is, to grasp the implementation of the plan on a daily and hourly basis from the most complex and basic production activities. Their division of labor is: the planner is responsible for formulating the plan and checking the implementation of the plan on a daily basis; the dispatcher assigns eight-hour tasks to each machine tool every day according to the shift operation plan and grasps the progress of the components; the dispatcher recorder goes to the machine tool every hour to record and controls the hourly progress within the scope of the dispatching list tasks. The engineer grasps the flow of work-in-process products on an hourly basis and reflects the flow situation to the "work-in-process hourly flow indication chart board" in a timely manner. The section chief and the group leader only need to look at this chart board to know the processing progress of each component every hour.

After the Fourth Section strengthened the management of the section processes from both the operation plan and the organizational management, not only did it basically eliminate the phenomenon of crash work and improve the machining equilibrium rate; more importantly, the section chief and the workshop director no longer run around to urge the components. They have a very clear understanding of the flow of more than 500 kinds of work-in-process products.

In the past, the workshop director often went to the sections and groups to check, but he had no idea in his mind. There were so many machine tools and more than 500 workers in the whole workshop. Where should he go to check? What should he check? Now the situation is different. He can understand the situation from every management personnel and every instruction chart. Workshop Director Wang Wenshan said that if he wants to check the work below, he first looks at the cycle operation plan instruction chart to check whether the work-in-process products are produced evenly every day; if not, he goes to check the work-in-process hourly flow indication board of the section to see which process and which machine tool these components are in, and then goes to the machine tool to look at the machine tool hourly progress board, directly analyzes the reasons and solves the problems with the workers. From 10:00 to 11:30 every morning, he listens to the section chief raise the problems to be solved that day. For these problems, he either points out the direction of solution to the section chief, or assigns management personnel to solve them. In short, he must abide by a principle: try to reduce the administrative work done by the section chief, so that they can concentrate their efforts on considering the key issues of the section and checking the implementation of the plan by the group. In this way, he can ensure balanced production and can continuously improve the production of the section.

Now it is much easier to compile the cycle operation plan. In the past, every time he made a plan, he always had to spend a lot of effort going to the machine tool to count the quantity of work-in-process products. Sometimes the counting was not clear, and sometimes even if the counting was clear, the estimation of the flow situation in the last few days was not accurate, and the component connection plan he made was not accurate. Now, the hourly progress is recorded, and the quota is close to accurate; with the work-in-process hourly flow indication board, the quantity of work-in-process products can be calculated at any time. Therefore, the connection operation plan that is made is not only easier, but also much more accurate.

However, the Second Workshop is only beginning to embark on the road of scientific management. To ensure continuous progress on this road, it is necessary to do a lot of hard and meticulous work. For example, the shift cycle operation plan has not been compiled according to the most economical principles and the most scientific calculation methods. The scrap rate is still very high. According to preliminary statistics, the average monthly scrap rate (calculated by man-hours) of the Second Workshop in the first half of the year was 18.73 percent, of which 7.43 percent was caused by poor quality of materials—castings and forgings, and 11.3 percent was caused by lack of tools and fixtures or workers violating operating procedures. Operating procedures are the most important laws in the socialist production organization. Failure to abide by them will undermine balanced production. However, in the factory, according to Wang Wenshan, in addition to generally calling for the implementation of operating procedures, there is little education for workers with the facts of violations of technical procedures that occur frequently. The idea of "I am the operating procedure, no matter what procedure you are" is still quite prevalent. The attendance rate is also very low, with an average of only about 91 percent per month in the first half of the year. Without thoroughly overcoming these shortcomings, it is impossible to consolidate the existing achievements, and it is impossible to gradually improve production on this basis.

    提高机械加工均衡率的关键
    ——记东北机械一厂二车间的工段作业计划
    陆超祺
    七月中旬，中央第一机械工业部在沈阳召开的厂长联席会议上，许多工厂的领导同志谈到加强计划管理的问题时，都证明凡是已经开始编制与贯彻了作业计划的，一般都能按照装配车间的需要组织机械加工，并能经常保持百分之九十以上的装配均衡率。但他们一致认为：如何把计划管理深入到机械加工的每一道工序去，使之能从最基层的也是最复杂的环节有效地指导每一个工人每一小时都按计划生产，从而提高机械加工的均衡率，克服加工过程的突击现象，这是最困难的。在所有工厂中，只有机械一厂第二车间——机械加工车间的第一和第四工段做到了这一点。这两个工段已经基本上消灭了突击现象。第四工段六月份第一周期（上旬）的加工均衡率达到百分之九十一，第二周期（中旬）达到百分之九十三，第三周期（下旬）达到百分之百，并提前一天完成计划。
    从提高机械加工的均衡率去达到装配的均衡，这是把我国机械工业计划管理水平提高了一步，是计划管理工作做得更深入的结果。机械一厂二车间在联合工段的基础上，根据装配车间的需要制订作业计划，按指示图表组织有节奏的生产，已经一年多了。去年和今年第一季度生产牛头刨床时，二车间基本上做到了每周平均供给装配车间十二台份，即十二套部件，使装配的均衡率达到百分之九十二。但是，那时候的作业计划也好，组织管理工作也好，像现在别的机械厂一样，都只能使车间主任、工段长控制部件的进度，即什么时候投多少料，什么时候该交出哪些部件；而对于大小几百种、几万件的部件、零件，每日每时在工序之间流转的情况，以及它们能不能按计划完成加工等，除了少数主要部件外则是谁也不知道的。机械一厂每月所生产的工作母机的部件，合计起来，加工车间每一个月就有三十九万多道工序。部件每变一个工序，就换一种机床；工序的时间有长有短，因此，部件在各种车床上的加工时间也不同。如果作业计划不能深入到具体规定每一部件的每一道工序的进度，即规定每台车床每小时该做什么；如果组织管理工作不能深入到掌握每一工序的生产，那末，部件在工序之间的流转便要处于自流状态。
    部件在工序之间的流转是自流的，便造成了加工过程的混乱。具体表现在：一、个别觉悟不高的工人就不按作业计划生产，他们先做好干的、赚钱多的活（因是计件工资），把不好干的、赚钱少的活放在一边。这样，有些应在月初完成的部件没有做出来，有些应在月末做好的却提前做好了。二、因为工人缺勤，或者因设备发生故障而使有些部件的加工赶不上计划进度时，工段长不容易知道，常常到按计划入库时才发现，只好靠组织突击来补救。三、每月二十五日编下一个月的作业计划时，虽然清点一次车间在制品的数目，但对于在制品在最后五天的流动情况的估计往往不很准确；因此下月份的作业计划与小组的生产情况便不符合。譬如有些机床按计划应该开始加工新的部件了，但它还在加工上一个月没有完成的部件。在上述三种情况下，加工车间为了供应成套的部件以保证装配的均衡，不得不经常组织突击生产。四、车间主任、工段长为了完成计划，每天不得不挨着车床去催促各种部件的生产，花去了他们大部分的时间，使他们不能很好地考虑车间、工段的生产问题。
    二车间根据苏联专家克拉沙夫柴夫同志的建议，从作业计划和组织管理两方面加强对工段工序的管理来解决这个问题。这个工作是在六月份从第四工段开始的。
    根据第四工段的经验，作业计划必须做到不只是规定每一小组和机床加工什么部件，以及它们应在什么时候交出这些部件，并且要规定每一台车床的每一天每一小时的活动，才能成为指导工人每天活动的行动纲领。为了做到这一点，计划员要深入到工段小组去，调查在制品现有数量，根据现有部件的多少和部件循环期的长短，与工段长，小组长编制不同部件的周期（十天）接头作业计划。这个计划的要求是规定工段、小组在周期内生产什么，由什么机床来负担，什么时候完成。因此，在订作业计划时，除了注意设备负荷平衡，注意把工序多、加工时间长的部件排在最前面加工，并采用多机床先加工一种部件的方法，以缩短加工时间外，还必须按每台机床能力确定它的加工数量，并把它所负责加工的部件及担当的工序大体固定下来，以免在执行计划时乱调动任务，保证小组按作业计划生产。
    周期作业计划还不能具体指导工人每天的活动。要做到这一点，四工段计划员每天还根据周期作业计划和新的工时定额，把每台机床在一班（八小时）之内应当完成的加工数量和工序，订出轮班（即昼夜班）作业计划。这个计划就是检查计划的执行、调度、派工的根据，它帮助工段长，小组长和管理人员掌握每天的生产情况，使提高全工段的加工均衡率成为可能。
    工段必须有管理组织，成为一个基层的管理单位。以前，二车间的管理人员都集中在车间里。由于周期作业计划不能指导每个工人、每台机床的每天具体活动，管理人员在计划实现过程中的工作便没有准绳，分工不清，没有起到应有的作用，只能掌握计划执行的结果。现在，四工段成立了计划、调度、工程、纪录等管理组织，其主要任务是根据轮班作业计划控制工序，即从最复杂最基层的生产活动中，按日按时地掌握计划的执行。他们的分工是：计划员负责订计划和按日检查计划的执行情况；调度员每天根据轮班作业计划，给每一台机床分配八小时的任务，并掌握部件的进度；调度纪录员按小时到机床去记录，并在派工单的任务范围内，控制小时的进度。工程员按小时掌握在制品的流动，并把流动的情况及时地反映到“在制品逐时流动指示图表板”上来。工段长，小组长只看这个图板就知道每一种部件每小时的加工进度。
    四工段从作业计划和组织管理两方面加强对工段工序的管理以后，不只是基本上消灭了突击现象，提高了加工的均衡率；更重要的是工段长和车间主任已不再为催促部件而奔跑。他们对五百多种在制品的流转情况，了解得十分清楚。
    以前，车间主任也经常到工段、小组去检查，但心里没有谱，全车间有那么许多台机床，五百多个工人，上哪儿去检查呢？查什么呢？现在情形不同了。他可以从每一个管理人员，每一张指示图表上了解情况。车间主任王文山说，他要是检查下面工作的话，首先看周期作业计划指示图表，检查在制品是不是逐日均衡生产；如果不是这样，就去检查工段在制品逐时流动指示图板，看看这些部件在哪一道工序、哪一台机床，然后就到机床去看机床逐时进度板，直接与工人分析原因和解决问题。每天上午十点到十一点半，分别听取工段长提出当天要解决的问题。对于这些问题，或者给工段长指出解决的方向，或者指定管理人员去解决。总之，要遵守一个原则：尽量减少工段长做事务性的工作，使他们集中力量去考虑工段的关键问题，以及检查小组执行计划的情况。这样，才可以保证均衡生产，才可以不断地提高工段的生产。
    现在编制周期作业计划也容易得多了。以前每一次做计划时，总要费很大的劲到机床上去清点在制品数量，有时清点不清楚，有时虽然清点清楚，但对最末几天的流动情况估计又不正确，订的部件接头计划也就不准确。现在按小时进度纪录，定额接近准确了；有了在制品逐时流动指示图板，随时都可以计算出在制品的数量。因此，订的接头作业计划不仅省事，而且准确得多。
    但是，二车间还只是开始走上科学管理的道路，要保证在这条道路上不断地前进，还要做许多艰苦的细致的工作。譬如，还没有按最经济的原则和最科学的计算方法编制轮番周期作业计划。废品率还很高。据初步统计，二车间上半年的废品率（按工时计算）平均每月为百分之十八点七三，其中因材料——铸锻件质量不好而造成的占百分之七点四三，因工具卡具缺乏或工人违反操作规程而造成的占百分之十一点三。操作规程是社会主义生产组织上的最重要法律，不遵守它，就要破坏均衡生产。但是，在一厂，据王文山说，除了曾经一般地号召贯彻操作规程外，很少用经常发生的违反技术规程的活的事实教育工人。“管你什么规程不规程，我就是操作规程”的思想还相当普遍地存在着。出勤率也很低，上半年每月平均只达到百分之九十一左右。不彻底克服这些缺点，就不可能巩固现有的成绩，也不可能在这个基础上把生产逐步提高。
