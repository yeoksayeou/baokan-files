Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 5th: Thanks to the active efforts of the heroic Korean and Chinese railway workers, railway transportation in the northern half of Korea is being rapidly restored.

Since the armistice, in order to fully restore railway transportation in the northern half of Korea in a short period, Korean and Chinese railway workers have maintained the tense working spirit of wartime, overcoming numerous difficulties, and carrying out the work of repairing routes, bridges, stations, and vehicles, and have now achieved great results. It is expected that the main lines and branch lines that were partially impassable during the war will be completely repaired by early August. Passenger trains on major trunk lines have already resumed service on some lines, and the rest will soon resume service as well. The Pyongyang-Sinuiju passenger train is now in operation. Passenger trains on major trunk lines such as Pyongyang-Kaesong, Pyongyang-Manpo, Pyongyang-Wonsan, and Pyongyang-Rajin will officially resume service from August 5th.

The Yongjin River Railway Bridge on the Sinmak-Kaesong section of the railway, a double-track bridge stretching 398.7 meters in length, was severely damaged by enemy aircraft. However, railway workers, under careful planning, launched a competition and, after several days of rush repairs, completed the work completely on July 31st.

Railway workers affiliated with the Hamhung Railway Administration actively carried out rush repairs on the 24 locations bombed by enemy aircraft 30 minutes before the armistice took effect, and completed the repairs entirely on July 28th. The Chongjin Railway Administration also completely repaired the damaged lines by July 29th. Employees of the Kasan supplementary line area solved the problem of hundreds of sleepers themselves during the restoration work. Employees of the locomotive depot where Li Renchao worked repaired 20 locomotives in just one day on July 29th.

    朝鲜北半部主要铁路干线的运输迅速恢复
    【新华社平壤五日电】在英勇的朝中铁路员工的积极努力下，朝鲜北半部的铁路运输正在迅速恢复。
    停战以后，为了在短期内完全恢复朝鲜北半部的铁路运输，朝中铁路员工们坚持着战时的紧张工作精神，克服了重重困难，进行修复路线、桥梁、站房和车辆等工作，现已取得了巨大成就。在战争期间一部分不能通车的干线和支线，预计在八月上旬以内可完全修复。主要干线的旅客列车有的已经通车，其余的也即将通车。现在已经通车的有平壤—新义州的客车。平壤—开城、平壤—满浦、平壤—元山、平壤—罗津等主要干线的旅客列车将自八月五日起正式通车。
    新幕—开城段铁路的龙津江大铁桥，复线往返长达三百九十八点七公尺，被敌机破坏得很严重。但是铁路员工们在周密的计划下，展开竞赛运动，经过几天的抢修，在七月三十一日就完全竣工。
    咸兴铁道管理局所属铁路员工们对在停战生效的三十分钟以前被敌机轰炸的二十四个地点积极进行抢修，七月二十八日就完全修复了。清津铁道管理局到七月二十九日也完全修复了被破坏的线路。价川补线区员工们在修复工作中自己想办法解决了数百根枕木。李仁朝工作的机务段的员工们，仅在七月二十九日的一天中就修理了二十辆机车。
