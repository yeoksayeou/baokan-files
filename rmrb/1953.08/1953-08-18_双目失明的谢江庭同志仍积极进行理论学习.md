Comrade Xie Jiangting, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs and Veteran Support of the People's Government of Hubei Province, and a member of the Communist Party, has been actively fighting for the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people since he joined the revolution in 1931 (when he was sixteen years old). In the course of the arduous struggle against enemies at home and abroad, he was wounded nine times. Finally, on the front lines of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was blinded in both eyes by artillery fire. However, he did not become pessimistic as a result. For many years, he has continued to work and study actively for the Party.

Since the launch of theoretical study among all Party cadres last winter, Comrade Xie Jiangting has been very excited. He realized that in the turbulent years of past battles, there was no opportunity for study, and his cultural and theoretical level was not high enough. Today, as the motherland enters a period of economic construction, the new tasks are very unfamiliar to him, and the new situation requires him to step up his efforts to study in order to complete the tasks assigned to him by the Party.

It is not difficult to imagine how difficult it is for a blind person to study theory, but a true Bolshevik will never bow his head in the face of difficulties. Comrade Xie Jiangting properly arranged his work and study time, and established a work and study system. He studies on time every morning. When studying, he concentrates on listening to his comrades read the study documents to him. He tries his best to grasp the main content of the documents, understand the spirit of the documents, and discover problems from them, and then find reference materials for research. He cannot rely on notes to help him remember, so he works hard to have others read the documents to him several times. When studying Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he listened to the entire text five times, including the third part – the Party – which he listened to nearly ten times.

His work is very busy. But he did not delay his studies because of his busy work. The theoretical study of cadres in the Department of Civil Affairs is going very well. Everyone says when they talk about it, "This is inseparable from the leading role of Director Xie." When theoretical study began last winter, the intermediate group of the Department of Civil Affairs was not studying well, and there was some spontaneous behavior. At this time, although Comrade Xie Jiangting had only been transferred here for a short time, he immediately discovered this problem and actively suggested to the branch: to absorb some comrades with a higher level from the primary group to form a large group, divided into two mutual aid groups, and adhere to collective study. Only in this way was the study put on the right track. Everyone also elected him as the leader of the study group.

Comrade Xie Jiangting conscientiously led the cadres' study. He said: "Neglecting cadres' study is a manifestation of a lack of political responsibility." Therefore, he regarded cadres' study and work as equally important issues, and emphasized compliance with the study system. At the beginning, there were still some cases of tardiness. He criticized them at the meeting and carefully exhorted everyone: "It's not okay not to study, you can't keep up with the development of the situation if you don't study." He himself is a model of punctuality. His residence is still some distance from the Department of Civil Affairs, but he has never been late once. Sometimes when everyone has not yet gotten up or is doing morning exercises, he is already sitting in his chair waiting to participate in the study. His exemplary action and sincere concern for the cadres moved many comrades. Since then, everyone has studied on time, and no one has ever been late. From last December to the present, the cadres' study time in the Department of Civil Affairs has not been encroached upon once. In the past, many comrades did not take study notes. He proposed establishing a system of checking notes and conducting criticism and self-criticism to ensure implementation. Now everyone takes study notes and outlines.

Comrade Xie Jiangting must listen to the People's Daily and the Hubei Daily every day. Before April, when the weather was not yet hot, he often used his nap time to listen to the newspapers. Comrades said, "He knows some news in the newspapers before people with eyes have even read it." But Comrade Xie Jiangting is not complacent. Sometimes he says with emotion, "I really envy those comrades who have eyes. They have so much time to use for study. They can read books and newspapers at any time, but I can't do it without someone reading to me." This sentence is worth our deep thought and reflection.

Comrades all respect and love Comrade Xie Jiangting. During the selection of learning models in the directly affiliated organs of Hubei Province this time, everyone unanimously selected him as an excellent learner in the intermediate group and invited him to serve as the director of the Study Committee of the Department of Civil Affairs.

    双目失明的谢江庭同志仍积极进行理论学习
    王怀扬  高一平  艾国云
    湖北省人民政府民政厅优抚处处长、共产党员谢江庭同志从一九三一年（他十六岁的时候）参加革命起，一直积极地为中国人民解放事业斗争着，在同国内外敌人作残酷的斗争中，他先后负伤九次，最后在抗日战争前线，两眼被炮火击伤而失明了。可是他并没有因此而消极，许多年来他仍积极地为党工作着、学习着。
    自从去年冬天全党干部展开理论学习后，谢江庭同志非常兴奋。他想到在过去战斗的动荡年月里，没有进行学习的机会，文化、理论水平都不够高；今天祖国进入经济建设时期，新的任务对自己是很陌生的，新的形势要求自己必须加紧努力学习，才能完成党所交给的任务。
    不难想像，一个眼睛失明的人学习理论是多么困难；但真正的布尔什维克是不会在困难面前低头的。谢江庭同志妥善地安排了工作和学习时间，规定了工作和学习制度。每天早上他按时进行学习。在学习时聚精会神地听同志们给他讲读学习文件，他极力做到抓住文件主要内容，领会文件精神，从中发现问题，再找参考资料来进行研究。他无法依靠笔记来帮助记忆，就下苦功让别人多读几遍文件。在学习联共第十九次代表大会上马林科夫同志的报告时，他前后听读了五遍全文，其中第三部分——党，他听读了近十遍。
    他的工作很忙。但他没有因工作忙而耽误学习。民政厅的干部理论学习搞得很好，大家一谈起来，都说：“这是和谢处长的带头作用分不开的。”去年冬天开始理论学习时，民政厅中级组学习不够好，有些自流的现象；这时谢江庭同志虽才调来不久，立即发现了这个问题，就积极向支部建议：吸收一些初级组水平较高的同志参加，组成一个大组，分为两个互助小组，坚持集体学习。这样才把学习引上正轨。大家并选他担任学习小组长。
    谢江庭同志认真地领导了干部学习。他说：“忽视干部学习就是政治责任心不强的表现”。因此他把干部学习和工作看成同样重要的问题，强调遵守学习制度。开始大家还有迟到现象，他就在会上加以批评，同时细心劝勉大家：“不学不行呀，不学跟不上形势的发展。”他自己就是遵守时间的榜样。他的住处距离民政厅还有一段路程，但他从没迟到过一次；有时大家还没有起床，或者正在做早操，他已坐在椅子上等候参加学习了。他这种模范行动和对干部的真挚的关怀感动了很多同志，以后大家都按时学习，从没有一个人迟到了。从去年十二月到现在，民政厅的干部学习时间没有被侵占过一次。过去很多同志不做学习笔记，他提议建立检查笔记制度，进行批评和自我批评，来保证执行。现在每个人都做了学习笔记和提纲。
    谢江庭同志每天一定要听读人民日报和湖北日报。当四月份以前天还不热的时候，他每天往往利用午睡时间听读报。同志们说：“报纸上有些消息，睁眼人还没读到他就知道了。”但谢江庭同志并不自满，有时还感慨地说：“我真羡慕那些有眼睛的同志，他们有多少时间可以利用来学习呵。随时可以读书看报；而我离开别人念就不行了。”这句话是值得我们深思猛省的。
    同志们都敬爱谢江庭同志，这次湖北省直属机关评选学习模范时，大家一致选他为中级组学习优良者，并请他担任民政厅学委会主任。
