Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: The Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture issued a circular to cotton-growing areas on the 17th, requiring them to strengthen cotton field drainage and pruning work to strive for increased cotton production.

The circular said: According to the situation in late July, with the exception of Anhui Province, cotton in most of the cotton-producing areas across the country is growing better than last year, and it is estimated that the average cotton yield per unit area nationwide can be increased by about 10% compared with last year. However, at present, many cotton-growing areas have experienced more rainfall, resulting in waterlogging in some cotton fields, while cotton plants in other cotton fields have begun to grow excessively, with a large number of flower and boll shedding. Therefore, further strengthening cotton field management work such as drainage and pruning to prevent cotton fields from being waterlogged due to rain, excessive cotton plant growth, and a large number of boll shedding has become the main key to ensuring increased cotton production. The circular requires: In areas with more autumn rain, drainage ditches should be dredged at any time before and during the rainy season to prevent soil collapse from blocking waterways; not only should surface water be drained, but also attention should be paid to deepening or supplementing ridge ditches to seep out excess moisture in the soil to benefit cotton plant growth. The circular said: Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Liaoxi, Hubei, Shaanxi and other provinces have all issued calls in July to carry out pruning and side-shoot removal to protect flowers and bolls. At present, most of the cotton plants in various places have completed the topping of the central stem, and it is the season for removing redundant buds, side shoots, and the tips of fruit branches. In the case of more rain, these tasks must be seized.

    中央农业部通报加强棉田排水和整枝工作
    【新华社十八日讯】中央人民政府农业部十七日通报棉区各地，要求加强棉田排水和整枝工作以争取棉花增产。
    通报说：根据七月下旬情况，除安徽省外，全国大部产棉区的棉花都比去年长的好，估计全国平均棉花单位面积产量可较去年提高一成左右。但目前不少棉区由于降雨较多，一部分棉田渍涝，另一部分棉田的棉株开始疯长，都有大量落花落铃的现象。因此，进一步加强棉田排水、整枝等管理工作，防止棉田因雨渍涝、棉株疯长和大量落铃，已成为目前保证棉花增产的主要关键。通报要求：在秋雨较多的地区，应在雨前和雨季中随时疏浚排水沟渠，防止土壤坍落阻塞水路；不但要排出地面积水，还要注意挖深或补挖疄沟，渗出土壤中的过多水分，以利棉株生长。通报说：江苏、山东、河南、辽西、湖北、陕西等省在七月间都已提出了为保花保铃进行整枝打杈的号召。目前各地棉株摘顶心已大部做完，正是去赘芽、打疯杈、掏果枝尖的季节，在雨水较多的情况下，更必须抓紧这些工作。
