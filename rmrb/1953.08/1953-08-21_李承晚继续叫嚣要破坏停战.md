Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 20th: Just as the United Nations General Assembly reconvenes to discuss the convening of a political conference as suggested in the Korean Armistice Agreement, Syngman Rhee is again and again issuing calls for a "march north."

In a speech delivered in Seoul on August 15th, Syngman Rhee said: "We hope and are determined to march north at the earliest possible time." Then, on the 17th, Syngman Rhee said in an interview with the American magazine "U.S. News & World Report": "I believe the United States will resume fighting in order to complete the common goal (of unifying Korea), because this is related to the honor and security of the United States." He said that South Korea may withdraw from the political conference in less than ninety days. He made it clear that in his mind, the "touchstone" of the success or failure of the political conference is whether or not North and South Korea can be unified under his fascist dictatorial rule. On the 19th, Syngman Rhee issued another statement demanding that the South Korean prisoners of war who had just been repatriated prepare to participate in the "march north" again.

    李承晚继续叫嚣要破坏停战
    【新华社开城二十日电】正当联合国大会复会讨论朝鲜停战协定建议的召开政治会议问题的时候，李承晚又接二连三地发出“向北进军”的叫嚣。
    李承晚十五日在汉城发表的演说中说：“我们希望并且有决心在尽可能最早的时候北进。”接着，在十七日，李承晚向美国杂志“美国新闻与世界报道”发表谈话说：“我相信美国会恢复战斗，以便完成（统一朝鲜的）共同目标，因为这与美国的荣誉与安全有关。”他说南朝鲜可能在不到九十天的时间就退出政治会议。他表明，在他的心目中政治会议成败的“试金石”就是能否把南北朝鲜统一在他的法西斯独夫统治之下。十九日，李承晚又发表声明，要求刚刚被遣返的南朝鲜战俘准备再度参加“向北进军”。
