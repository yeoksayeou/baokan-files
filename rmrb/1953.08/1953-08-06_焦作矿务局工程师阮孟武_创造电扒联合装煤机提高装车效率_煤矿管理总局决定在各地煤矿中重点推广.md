Jiao Zuo Mining Bureau Engineer Ruan Mengwu
Creates Electric Shovel Combined Coal Loader to Improve Loading Efficiency
Coal Mine Management Bureau Decides to Focus on Promotion in Coal Mines Nationwide

    Jiao Zuo Mining Bureau's young engineer, Ruan Mengwu, with the help of workers, successfully created an electric shovel combined coal loader. The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry has decided to focus on promoting this device in coal mines across the country in order to improve loading efficiency and improve workers' working conditions.
    For more than 30 years, the large amounts of coal sent out from the Jiao Zuo Coal Mine have been manually transported when loading onto trains. The production efficiency was extremely low, and the workers' working conditions were also very poor. After liberation, the Jiao Zuo Coal Mine made great improvements in implementing mechanized production, greatly reducing the heavy physical labor of the workers, but the ground coal transportation work still used the backward method of manual basket loading, and was not improved for a time.
    In June 1951, Jiao Zuo Coal Mine's young engineer, Ruan Mengwu, responded to the call of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, and with the support of the factory's Party committee and administration, and with the help of Soviet expert Denyisov and worker Zhao Jinming and others, began to research the electric shovel combined coal loader. By the end of 1951, he had completed the design and began testing. He successfully tested it on the "May 1st" Labor Day in 1952, and it was officially used in the Jiao Zuo Wangfeng Mine. This involved a total of eleven tests and modifications.
    The electric shovel combined coal loader has been successfully created and used in the Jiao Zuo mine for a year, and the situation is good. It has improved efficiency by 15 to 25 times compared to the original manual handling, greatly reducing costs and shortening loading time. It is estimated that it can save the country funds worth 25 million jin of millet each year. The use of the machine has also reduced the physical labor of the Jiao Zuo mine's loading workers, protecting the health and safety of the workers. The Coal Mine Management Bureau issued instructions a few days ago, deciding to promote it with emphasis in coal mines nationwide. The instructions also pointed out that leaders at all levels of the Mining Bureau should actively support the promotion work, eliminate some ideological obstacles that may arise among employees, and commend those who have contributed to the promotion.

    创造电扒联合装煤机提高装车效率
    煤矿管理总局决定在各地煤矿中重点推广
    焦作矿务局青年工程师阮孟武在工人们的帮助下，创造电扒联合装煤机成功。中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局已决定在各地煤矿中有重点的推广这种装置，以提高装车效率，改善工人的劳动条件。
    焦作煤矿由井下送出的大量煤炭，在装上火车时，三十余年来都是由人力搬运的，生产效率极低，工人的劳动条件也极坏。解放后，焦作煤矿在实行机械化生产上有了很大的改进，大大减轻了工人们繁重的体力劳动，但是地面煤炭运搬工作仍然是用人工抬筐装车的落后方法，一时没有得到改进。
    焦作煤矿青年工程师阮孟武在一九五一年六月响应了中央燃料工业部的号召，在该厂党委与行政的支持下，和苏联专家捷尼索夫及工人赵金明等的帮助下，开始研究电扒联合装煤机，到一九五一年底作出了设计，并开始试验，一九五二年“五一”节试验成功，并正式在焦作王封矿使用。这中间共经过十一次的试验和修改。
    电扒联合装煤机创制成功后已在焦作矿使用一年，情形良好，比原来人工搬运提高了效率十五倍至二十五倍，大大减低了成本，缩短了装车时间，估计每年可为国家节省价值二千五百万斤小米的资金。使用机器的结果也减轻了焦作矿装车工人的体力劳动，保护了工人们的健康和安全。煤矿管理总局于日前发出了指示，决定在全国煤矿有重点地推广，指示中并指出在推广工作中矿务局各级领导应积极予以支持，扫除职工中可能产生的一些思想障碍，对推广有功者应予表扬。
