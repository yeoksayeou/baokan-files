    Large Numbers of Bao Dai Puppet Troops Surrender to the People's Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch] Due to the correct policy of leniency towards prisoners of war and the land policy implemented by the Vietnamese People's Army and the Republic government, the morale of the Bao Dai puppet troops, which was already low, is falling further, and large numbers are deserting and returning to the people of Vietnam. According to the Vietnam News Agency, in the past few months, according to incomplete statistics, more than 2,000 puppet troops in various parts of the Red River Delta in North Vietnam have surrendered to the people. In May and early June, more than 950 puppet troops surrendered on the left bank of the Red River. In June alone, more than 300 puppet troops surrendered in one county in Nam Dinh province. At the same time, more and more puppet troops are demanding demobilization, using various methods to avoid participating in the French army's "sweeps" and requesting to go home.
    The surrendered puppet troops immediately receive a portion of land reserved for them from the local people's government and farmers' associations and cultivate it in a timely manner. Therefore, many family members of puppet troops are calling on their husbands and sons to return home.

    保大伪军大批向人民军投诚
    【新华社十六日讯】由于越南人民军与共和国政府实行正确的宽待俘虏政策和土地政策，士气低落的保大伪军正在大批开小差，归顺越南人民。据越南通讯社报道：在过去几个月中，据不完全统计，北越红河三角洲各地有伪军两千多人归顺人民。五月份和六月初，红河左岸的伪军投诚的有九百五十人以上。六月份仅在南定省一个县，就有伪军三百多人投诚。同时，要求复员的伪军也越来越多，他们用各种办法逃避参加法军的“扫荡”，要求回家。
    归顺的伪军马上从当地人民政权和农会领到留给他们的一份土地，及时进行耕种。因此，很多伪军家属都纷纷叫她们的丈夫和儿子回家。
