Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 4th: A "Pravda" correspondent in London reports: British newspapers continue to comment on Anglo-American relations following the recent foreign policy debates in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The central theme in the British newspapers is the Far East policy after the Korean Armistice Agreement and Britain's attitude.

The "Pravda" correspondent points out that British newspapers are calling for the restoration of normal trade with the East. In this regard, he cited an article published by Harold Wilson, former Minister of Trade in the Labor government, in the "Reynolds News." Wilson wrote that the Korean armistice points to a way out. He said: We can now begin to restore trade between East and West. Wilson said: The Korean armistice is not only a signal to lift the trade blockade against China, but also a "signal" to generally reduce trade restrictions between East and West.

Other British newspapers have expressed the same views. The "Pravda" correspondent said: It is noteworthy that British newspapers said during the Korean armistice negotiations that the embargo against China would inevitably be lifted after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

The "Manchester Guardian," reflecting the views of influential industrialists, said: Many British manufacturing and commercial companies are paying close attention to the issue of trade with China once the Korean Armistice Agreement is signed. After the cessation of hostilities, it is necessary to immediately revise the policy and give real support to those who are very willing to trade with China. No one should doubt those who trade with China—this attitude existed in the past, but it shouldn't; the British government needs to implement London's policies, not Washington's policies.

The semi-official British Reuters news agency spoke even more vehemently. Commenting on the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the news agency pointed out: The United States can no longer dominate and determine the West's Far East policy, because the armistice has affected the United States' position. Britain and other Western countries that recognize Communist China have regained their freedom of action.

Labor MP Crossman wrote in the "Sunday Pictorial" that Britain's responsibility is very clear. The UN General Assembly will be meeting in two weeks. Even if the United States refuses to consult with its British allies, it cannot ignore the resolutions of the United Nations. He said that we must take joint action with India and other Commonwealth countries to use the UN General Assembly to establish a peaceful system that even Washington's most frantic cold war advocates would not dare to undermine.

According to Xinhua News Agency: The Australian "Guardian" published an editorial opposing Australia's foreign policy following the directions of the United States.

The "Guardian's" editorial wrote: "In recent years, it has become a very difficult thing to talk about Australia's foreign policy. Because a policy should put forward some clear goals of our own, which we are trying to achieve through diplomatic means. Indeed, the tactic we have adopted is to be a timid child, content to follow his leader without asking where to go or why. This leader is Washington, and we seem content to accept its decisions, hoping to benefit in the future. The Australian government believes that because the United States is the most powerful country in the Pacific, Australia's future depends entirely on whether it is favored. It is discouraging to examine how deeply the Australian government has been influenced by this view in recent years. We seem to have passed a new unwritten law: under no circumstances should we offend Washington. Indeed, this is a cowardly policy; it is an attitude of evading problems in the new world. What other path is there besides hiding under Uncle Sam's coattails?"

The newspaper concluded: The foundation of Australia's foreign policy should be to establish good neighborly relations with the people of Asian countries.

    “真理报”驻伦敦记者报道英报对英国外交政策的评论
    主张奉行独立政策的呼声在英国愈来愈高
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：“真理报”驻伦敦记者报道：英国报纸继续就最近在上下两院中举行的外交辩论评论英美关系。英国报纸的中心论题是朝鲜停战协定签订后的远东政策及英国的态度。
    真理报记者指出，英国报纸要求恢复与东方的正常贸易。在这方面，他援引了前工党政府贸易大臣哈罗德·威尔逊在“雷诺新闻”上发表的一篇文章。威尔逊写道，朝鲜停战指出了一条出路。他说：我们现在能开始恢复东西方的贸易了。威尔逊说：朝鲜停战不仅是取消对中国的贸易封锁的信号，而且是普遍减少东西方之间的贸易限制的“信号”。
    其他英国报纸也表示了同样的意见。“真理报”记者说：英国报纸在朝鲜停战谈判进行期间曾经说朝鲜停战协定签订后必将取消对中国的禁运，这是耐人寻味的。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”反映有势力的工业界人士的意见说：英国许多制造公司和商业公司极为注意朝鲜停战协定一旦签订以后与中国的贸易问题。战争停止以后，有必要立即修改政策，给予那些极愿意与中国进行贸易的人以真正的支持。大家不应该怀疑那些与中国进行贸易的人——这种态度过去是有过的，而其实是不应该的；英国政府有必要执行伦敦的政策而不是华盛顿的政策。
    半官方的英国路透社讲的话甚至还要激烈。该通讯社在评论朝鲜停战协定的签订时指出：美国再也不能支配并决定西方的远东政策了，因为停战已经使美国的地位受到了影响。英国和其他承认共产党中国的西方国家重新得到了行动的自由。
    工党议员克罗斯曼在“星期日画报”上发表文章说：英国的责任非常明显。联合国大会还有两星期就要举行会议了。即令美国拒绝和它的英国盟友磋商，它也不能不顾联合国的决议。他说，我们必须和印度及英联邦的其他国家采取联合行动，利用联合国大会来建立一种即使是华盛顿的最疯狂的鼓吹冷战的人也不敢破坏的和平制度。
    据新华社讯：澳大利亚“守卫报”发表社论，反对澳大利亚的外交政策听从美国的指挥。
    “守卫报”的社论写道：“在最近几年中，要谈谈澳大利亚的外交政策已经变成了一件非常困难的事情。因为一个政策应该提出我们自己的一些明确的目标，这些目标是我们企图通过外交途径来达到的。的确，我们所采取的策略是做一个胆小的孩子，满足于跟着他的领导者走，而不问到哪里去，也不问为什么。这个领导者就是华盛顿，我们似乎满足于接受它的决定，希望将来得到好处。澳大利亚政府认为，由于美国是太平洋上最有势力的国家，澳大利亚的前途完全取决于它的宠爱与否。最近几年中如果考察澳大利亚政府受这种看法的影响到什么地步，那是令人丧气的。我们似乎通过了一条新的不成文法律：在任何情况下不应该触怒华盛顿。的确，这是一种胆小如鼠的政策；这是一种规避新世界上的问题的态度。除了藏身在山姆叔叔燕尾服下的政策外，其他的道路是什么呢？”
    该报最后说：澳大利亚外交政策的基础应该是与亚洲各国的人民建立睦邻关系。
