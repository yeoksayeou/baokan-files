Construction units in Shenyang, Anshan, Tianjin, Tangshan and other places have begun to launch mass quality inspections, strengthen mass ideological education, and establish and improve technical quality responsibility systems and technical management in order to ensure that project quality meets national standards.

Due to weak technical management, the quality of most of the first phase projects in Shenyang was poor. In order to learn from this lesson, a mass quality inspection was launched in late July. The Second Engineering Company of the Non-Ferrous Metallurgical Industry Bureau, the First, Second, and Third Engineering Companies affiliated with the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau have completed their inspections. The First Engineering Company of the Electrical Industry Bureau and the Shenyang Construction Engineering Company and Shenyang Installation Engineering Company of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building are actively preparing or are underway. In the process of mobilizing the masses for inspection, all construction sites have focused on inspecting the important parts of the project – concrete and bricklaying – and have organized workers and cadres to study quality standards, combining quality accidents to educate workers on the importance of quality. Units that have undergone preliminary inspection are currently strengthening technical management and implementing various systems, and are actively resolving the problems discovered during the inspection. After the mass inspection, the phenomenon of poor project quality in some units has begun to change. For example, Construction Site 308 has corrected shortcomings such as uneven spacing and loose ties of steel bars in the past. In the past, the third construction site of the Non-Ferrous Metallurgical Industry Bureau's Second Engineering Company in Nanhu had problems with incomplete mortar and uneven walls when laying bricks, which has now begun to change.

In mid-July, Anshan Iron and Steel Company focused on the four units of the Rolling Mill Construction Engineering Company to conduct pilot work on quality inspection. The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Basic Construction Department of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China jointly formed a working group to provide specific assistance to the construction site. Their pilot method was to first summarize the lessons learned from poor project quality in the past and the experiences, advanced figures, and advanced ideas for ensuring good quality, and call on employees to study and promote them. Then, analyze and study quality-related issues, identify the key factors that determine quality, and then check the establishment and implementation of the technical responsibility system. Due to in-depth ideological education, a mass upsurge of ensuring and supervising project quality was launched. A moral atmosphere of resistance was created against various irresponsible phenomena such as neglecting project quality, not complying with technical operating procedures, and not implementing handover inspection systems. For example, when pouring concrete for Foundation No. 133, Liu Changxun, the full-time foreman, believed that the concrete had too much moisture. Without research and discussion, he arbitrarily violated the operating procedures, chiseled through the formwork, and used buckets to discharge the slurry. Worker Gu Zhensheng and others immediately raised their objections and stopped him.

The Tianjin Municipal Government Engineering Bureau recently inspected the quality of municipal engineering projects in the city. Through inspection, many construction sites have implemented the daily project quality inspection system and the concealed works inspection system, and established or improved the handover system. In mid-July, the Kailuan Coal Mine Basic Construction Engineering Company in Tangshan conducted a mass quality inspection, and found that the phenomenon of poor project quality was very common. After the inspection, each engineering team mobilized the masses to study and improve the problems that were found. For example, the Linxi Engineering Team mobilized workers to find the causes and come up with solutions, and improved the defects of prefabricated floor slabs with rough surfaces and honeycombs.

Although some construction sites have not conducted mass quality inspections, they have further implemented the technical responsibility system and strengthened technical management on the basis of carrying out the responsibility system movement, thus also changing the phenomenon of poor project quality. For example, after the responsibility system movement, the Fourth Engineering Team of the Heilongjiang Construction Engineering Bureau conscientiously implemented the technical guidance responsibility system, the quality inspection system, and the individual responsibility system, so the project quality has been greatly improved. The phenomena of incomplete grouting, rat holes, and straight seams in masonry have been completely eliminated, and more than 95% of woodworking products meet the specifications. The project quality of Factory 301 used to be extremely poor. Since the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted inspections and criticisms in the newspapers, they have actively strengthened technical management on the basis of establishing the responsibility system movement, mobilized the masses to discuss quality standards, and implemented a method combining independent inspection and construction inspection. The quality inspection section carried out inspections together with the on-site inspection personnel according to the operating procedures and quality standards during the construction process, and immediately proposed corrections if there were any problems, thus avoiding rework. Due to this series of measures, the project quality has been significantly improved. Since May, all projects have met the design standards, and no quality accidents have occurred from June to the present.

    沈阳、鞍山、天津、唐山等地施工单位
    开展群众性的质量检查
    沈阳、鞍山、天津、唐山等地施工单位，已开始展开了群众性的质量大检查，加强群众思想教育，建立和健全技术质量责任制和技术管理，以求工程质量达到国家规定的标准。
    沈阳市第一期工程由于技术管理薄弱，大部工程质量不好。为接受这一教训，在七月下旬开展了群众性的质量大检查。现有色金属工业管理局第二工程公司、沈阳市建筑工程局所属第一工程公司、第二工程公司和第三工程公司等单位已经检查完毕；电器工业管理局第一工程公司和中央第一机械工业部的沈阳建筑工程公司、沈阳安装工程公司等单位正在积极准备或进行中。各工地在发动群众进行检查中，都着重检查了工程的重要部分——混凝土工程和砌砖工程，并组织工人和干部学习质量标准，结合质量上的事故向工人进行重视质量的教育。经过初步检查的单位，目前正在加强技术管理和贯彻各项制度，积极解决检查中发现的问题。经过群众性的检查后，有些单位工程质量低劣的现象已开始改变，如三○八工地已纠正了过去铁筋做得宽窄不均、扣拧得不紧等缺点。有色金属工业管理局第二工程公司南湖第三工地过去砌砖灰浆不满、墙面不平，现已开始转变。
    鞍山钢铁公司在七月中以轧钢建筑工程公司的四个单位为重点，进行了质量检查的试点工作。中央重工业部和中共鞍山市委基本建设部等共同组成了工作组，到工地进行具体帮助。他们试点的办法是：先总结过去工程质量坏的教训和保证质量好的经验、先进人物和先进思想，号召职工学习推广。然后分析、研究有关质量方面的问题，找出决定质量好坏的关键，再检查技术责任制建立与贯彻的情况。由于深入进行了思想教育，掀起了群众性的保证与监督工程质量的热潮。对忽视工程质量，不遵守技术操作规程，不执行交接班检查制度等各种不负责任的现象，造成了一种道德抵制的气氛。如在打一百三十三号基础混凝土时，专职领工员刘长训认为混凝土水分过多，未经研究讨论，擅自违反操作规程，凿穿模板，用水桶往外放浆，工人谷振声等立即提出意见制止了。
    天津市政府工程局在最近检查了该市市政工程的质量。通过检查，许多工地贯彻了每日工程质量检查制度和隐蔽工程检查制度，建立或健全了交接班制度。唐山开滦煤矿基本建设工程公司在七月中旬，进行了一次群众性的质量检查，发现工程质量低劣的现象很普遍。检查之后，对检查出来的问题，各工程队都发动群众进行研究改进。如林西工程队就发动工人找原因，想办法，改进了预制楼板出麻面蜂窝的缺点。
    有的工地虽未进行群众性的质量大检查，但在开展责任制运动的基础上，进一步贯彻了技术责任制，加强了技术管理，因而也改变了工程质量低劣的现象。如黑龙江建筑工程局第四工程队在责任制运动后，认真贯彻了技术指导责任制、质量检查制和个人专责制，因而工程质量大大提高，砌石时灌浆不饱、鼠洞、直缝等现象已完全消灭，木工的产品也有百分之九十五以上合乎规格。三○一厂过去工程质量极坏，自从中央重工业部和中共中央东北局进行检查和报纸上批评后，即积极在建立责任制运动的基础上加强技术管理，发动群众讨论了质量标准，实行了独立检查与施工检查相结合的办法。质量检查科在施工过程中和现场检查人员一起按照操作规程、质量标准进行检查，有毛病立刻提出纠正，因而避免了返工的发生。由于这一系列的措施，工程质量显著提高，从五月份起所有工程全部达到设计标准，从六月份到现在还没有发生一次质量事故。
