    Beijing People's Record Factory Produces Phonetic Alphabet Records

    The Beijing People's Record Factory, after examination and approval by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and under the supervision of the Central People's Broadcasting Administration, has specially produced phonetic alphabet records. The set consists of five records, systematically explaining the pronunciation, articulation, spelling, and tones of the phonetic alphabet. It is specifically designed for Mandarin teachers to learn the alphabet, aiding in recognition, pronunciation, spelling, and tone differentiation. These phonetic alphabet records serve to unify the pronunciation of Chinese characters nationwide, laying a solid foundation for establishing the "national common language" of the Chinese nation, and also aiding in literacy. Therefore, this set of phonetic alphabet records is the best auxiliary tool for Mandarin teachers to learn the phonetic alphabet in a short period. The aforementioned records are now available for sale at service departments of People's Broadcasting Stations and branches of the China Department Store in various locations.

    Anhui Provincial Cultural Bureau Organizes Efforts to Investigate and Research Opera Heritage

    The Anhui Provincial People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau, in order to understand the actual situation of opera and music heritage, has decided to conduct in-depth investigations and research on several major opera genres in the province.

    Seven creative cadres and five music cadres have been selected to form groups, which will delve into key troupes of four major opera genres: Daoqi Opera, Huangmei Opera, Sizhou Opera, and Flower Drum Opera (Southern Anhui). This work is to be preliminarily completed within the three months of the third quarter.

    This investigation and research aims to achieve the following: to record the plots, origins, and public popularity of all large and small plays. After collective research, to preliminarily categorize them into three main categories: excellent, easily modifiable; not very good, difficult to modify; and very bad, difficult to modify. The lines of the first category of plays will also be recorded. Efforts will be made to collaborate with artists to modify one or two small plays for each opera genre. As for the modification of large plays and major reorganization work, it will be carried out gradually based on the results of the investigation and after researching the subjects. In terms of music, all singing styles will be recorded, and the main and good melodies will be recorded. These musical materials will then be compiled, accompanied by written introductions, to achieve a basic understanding of the various opera genres.

    Before the cadres went down, leading comrades of the Cultural Bureau held a special meeting to study working methods, instructing everyone to "get to the bottom" of everything this time. This is crucial to the future reorganization of plays and the reform of opera music. It is also a process for opera work cadres to learn from the rich heritage and traditional strengths. Close cooperation with artists, especially veteran artists and talented outstanding actors, as well as the original business cadres of each troupe, is essential. The "categorization" of plays must be approached with correct viewpoints, that is, analyzed cautiously with a scientific attitude. The findings must be brought to the province for collective correction and leadership review before preliminary confirmation can be made.

    安徽省文化局组织力量调查研究戏曲遗产
    安徽省人民政府文化事业管理局，为了解戏曲和音乐遗产的实际情况，决定深入地进行本省几个主要剧种的调查研究工作。
    现已抽出七个创作干部和五个音乐干部，分别组成小组，深入到倒七戏、黄梅戏、泗洲戏、花鼓戏（皖南）等四个主要剧种的重点剧团去，要在第三季度的三个月内初步完成这个工作。
    这一次调查研究要达到这样要求：要把全部大小剧目的剧情、来源、群众喜爱情况等都记录下来，并经过集体研究，初步的排一下队，大致分成：优秀的，很容易修改的；不大好的，修改较困难的；很坏的，难以修改的等三大类。并要将第一类剧目的台词记录下来。争取与艺人合作，每个剧种修改一两个小剧目。至于大剧目的修改以及主要的整理工作是要根据调查情况研究好对象后，将来逐步进行。音乐方面要将全部唱腔记录下来，将其中主要的和好的曲调进行录音。并要将这些音乐材料加以整理，配合文字介绍，以达到对各个剧种的基本情况的了解。
    在干部下去以前，文化局领导同志，曾召开专门会议，研究了工作方法，指示大家这一次要全部“摸底”。这是关系今后剧目整理和戏曲音乐改革的关键所在，同时也是戏曲工作干部向丰富的遗产和传统的特长学习的过程。必须与艺人、特别是老艺人和有才能的优秀演员及各剧团原来的业务干部密切合作。对剧目的“排队”工作必须以正确的观点，即以科学的态度来慎重分析，将来要带到省里来经过集体校正，领导审查，才能初步确定。
