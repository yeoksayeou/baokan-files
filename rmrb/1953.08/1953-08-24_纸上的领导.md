    Leadership on Paper
    Zhu Siyi
    On the wall of the manager's office of the Zhongnan Electric Power Engineering Company, there is a "Company Scope of Responsibility Regulations" personally drafted by the company manager, which stipulates the manager's "scope of responsibility" as follows:
    1. Review and issue important documents and documents bearing the company's name (including requests, announcements, notices, orders, plans, etc.).
    2. Decide on personnel appointments, removals, transfers, rewards, and punishments.
    3. Approve and publish various plans, systems, and regulations.
    4. Approve financial plans and important financial expenditures.
    5. Approve various engineering measures.
    6. Review and approve engineering contracts.
    7. Decide on other important matters.
    To synthesize these seven major tasks into one, it is "signing and sealing." Manager Zhang has always strictly adhered to this regulation. He spends all day in the office writing and listening to reports. All documents, large and small, coming and going within the company must be personally reviewed by him. Even a request for a desk from the Youth League Working Committee must be approved by him. If he is too busy during the day, he has to work overtime at night. But unfortunately, he is completely clueless about the construction situation on the site, the completion of plans, the work of the departments, and the ideological situation of the employees; the formulation and organization of the implementation of construction plans, how to ensure and improve project quality, how to improve business management... He ignores all of these. In this way, Manager Zhang is completely trapped in the quagmire of serious bureaucracy.
    Thus, a very incongruous situation has formed between the intense construction site and the bureaucratic manager's office: the progress of engineering construction requires the leadership to have an insightful, wise, and decisive, intense, and combative work style, but our manager is buried in piles of documents all day long, unable to extricate himself.
    Comrade Stalin once sharply criticized this leadership style in "The Tasks of Business Executives": "What does it mean to lead production? Some of us do not always take a Bolshevik approach to the issue of leading enterprises. Some of us often think that leadership means signing documents and orders. This is distressing," "What makes us ashamed is that among us Bolsheviks, there are many who rely solely on signing documents to lead. But when it comes to studying business, mastering technology, and becoming experts—they pay no attention to this." The "reason for this situation lies in the fact that signing documents is easier than leading production. Thus, many economic workers take the path of least resistance." Manager Zhang is undoubtedly such a leader.
    It is time to wake up, "end leadership on paper," implement "concrete and practical" leadership, and make oneself "proficient in work technology, familiar with work details," and "interfere in all affairs." Comrade Stalin said it well: "As long as we are truly willing, we will definitely achieve this!"

    纸上的领导
    朱思义
    中南电业工程公司经理室的墙上，高贴着一张由公司经理亲自拟订的“公司职责范围规定”，其中规定经理的“职责范围”如下：
    1、重要公文之批阅及签发具有公司名义之文件（包括请示、公告、通知、命令、计划等）。
    2、人事任免、调动、奖惩之裁定。
    3、各种计划、制度、规章之批准与公布。
    4、财务计划及重要财务开支之批准。
    5、各项工程措施之批准。
    6、工程合同之审定与批准。
    7、其他重要事务之裁夺。
    把这七大工作综合成一件工作，就是“签字画押”。张经理一直很严格地遵守着这个规定。他整天在办公室里动笔杆、听汇报，公司所有的大小公文一来一往都得由他亲自过目，青年团工委要一张办公桌也要由他批准。白天忙不过来，晚上还得加班。但可惜的是，他对工地的施工情况、计划的完成情况、科室的工作情况、职工的思想情况等，却完全心中无数；施工计划的制订和组织执行、工程质量如何保证和提高、经营管理如何改进……他都置之不理。就这样，张经理完全陷入了严重的文牍主义的泥坑。
    就这样，紧张的施工现场和文牍主义的经理办公室之间形成了一个十分不相称的局面：工程施工的进程要求于领导的是：洞悉情况，明智果敢的紧张、战斗的工作作风，但我们的经理却整天埋在公文堆里，拔不出腿来。
    斯大林同志在“论经济工作人员的任务”中曾这样尖锐地批评过这种领导作风：“领导生产是什么意思呢？我们有些人并不总是布尔什维克式地来看领导企业问题的。我们有些人往往以为领导就是签签公文和命令。这是令人痛心的”，“使我们可耻的，就是在我们布尔什维克中间，也有不少这种专靠签签公文来进行领导的人。可是说到钻研业务，精通技术，变成内行——对于这方面，他们却毫不理睬。”产生这种情况的“原因就在于签署公文要比领导生产容易。于是许多经济工作人员就走上了这条阻力最小的道路”。张经理无疑的正是这样的领导人员。
    该是清醒起来、“结束纸上领导”、实行“具体切实”的领导、使自己“精通工作技术、熟悉工作详情”“干予一切事务”的时候了。斯大林同志说得好：“只要我们真正愿意，我们一定会做到这一点！”
