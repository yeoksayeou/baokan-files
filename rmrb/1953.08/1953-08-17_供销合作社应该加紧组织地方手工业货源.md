    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Should Expedite the Organization of Local Handicraft Goods

    The autumn crops are about to be on the market, and the peak season is approaching. In order to ensure the smooth completion of the state's cotton and autumn grain procurement tasks, and to meet the needs of farmers to purchase production materials and living materials after selling grain and cotton, the supply work of supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should be strengthened immediately.

    Past experience in purchasing cotton and grain has proven that: wherever the material supply work is done well in conjunction with the procurement work, the state's price policy can be guaranteed, the interests of farmers will be protected, and the procurement task can be successfully completed. If the supply and demand are out of balance, it will give speculators an opportunity to exploit, the state's price policy will be undermined, the interests of farmers will be damaged, farmers will be dissatisfied with the cooperatives and the state, and the procurement task will not be completed well.

    The central link in strengthening the material supply work of supply and marketing cooperatives is to take active and effective measures to expedite the organization of goods, especially to organize and open up sources of goods from local industry and handicrafts. Because at present, when large-scale industrial production is still insufficient, handicraft products still account for a large proportion in rural areas. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions generally pay attention to organizing industrial products from large cities, but do not pay attention to organizing local handicraft products. Many cooperatives are only willing to operate "branded goods" or best-selling goods from large cities, and are unwilling to operate sporadic and complex local handicraft products. Many supply and marketing cooperatives do not understand the needs of farmers and members and the production and sales of handicraft products, and subjectively believe that handicraft products are of low quality, high price, many varieties, and low demand, which are not in line with economic accounting and have no operating conditions. Therefore, the local handicraft products needed by members have not yet been introduced into the retail network of the cooperative in large quantities and in a planned manner. The more than 200 wholesale stations above the provincial level in the cooperative system mainly focus on the transit business of industrial products from large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin, so the difficulties of incomplete goods and insufficient commodities in grassroots cooperatives have not been changed as they should be.

    It should be recognized that 60%, 70%, or even about 80% of the production materials and living materials needed by farmers in our country are still supplied by urban and rural handicraft products, and a large part of agricultural products are also sold as handicraft raw materials. According to a survey in the rural suburbs of Ji'an Town, Ji'an County, Jiangxi Province, an ordinary poor peasant family consumes not only handicraft products such as fermented soybeans, cotton belts, socks, handkerchiefs, local paper, and local sugar, but also more than 50 items and more than 100 pieces of handicraft products in terms of production tools and household utensils alone, with a total value of about 2.3 million yuan, and they need to be repaired and supplemented every year. The property in the homes of local farmers, in addition to fields, houses, and livestock, is mostly handicraft products, and industrial products account for only a very small part. Many local handicrafts are basically produced according to the needs of local residents, especially the needs of farmers. For example, 80% of the handicraft products in Shijiazhuang City are sold in nearby counties. Agricultural tools such as hoes, adzes, and brooms produced by handicrafts in Weifang City, Shandong Province, are sold in the local area and in rural areas of Zibo, Laiyang, Yishui and other counties in the province, and the supply falls short of demand. Facts have proved that local handicraft products are urgently needed by farmers and members, and cooperatives should actively organize local handicraft goods.

    In order to actively organize local industrial and handicraft goods, provincial and county cooperatives should, with the approval of the provincial and county financial and economic committees and in close contact with state-owned commerce, hold material exchange meetings focusing on handicrafts, local industries, and local specialty products before or during the autumn harvest peak season, so as to understand and communicate production and sales conditions through sample exhibitions and actual exchanges, and lay the foundation for organizing local goods, especially handicraft goods, in a planned manner. Before holding material exchange meetings, efforts should be organized to conduct necessary investigations and comprehensive analysis of the production and sales of local handicrafts and local industries, as the basis for guiding material exchanges, and samples should be widely collected for exhibition, so that cooperatives participating in the exchange meeting can compare samples for exchange and sign orders. In the actual exchange, contracts should be signed realistically based on needs and financial capabilities to ensure the implementation of the contracts and prevent blind orders.

    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should focus on establishing contact with local handicraftsmen, signing contracts, helping them supply raw materials, and selling the finished products they produce that are needed by members of the supply and marketing cooperatives. It is wrong to neglect the organization of local handicraft goods; however, it is also wrong to adopt a "contracting" method for all local handicraft products without regard to needs and possibilities. The Yiliang County Cooperative Union and the Yiliang Special District Trading Company in Yunnan Province, without distinguishing different situations, according to needs and possibilities, signed processing contracts with the vast majority of handicraftsmen in the county. Most of the raw materials needed by the handicraftsmen were supplied by the cooperative, and the finished products, regardless of variety and specifications, were completely sold by the cooperative. As a result, it not only destroyed the original procurement and sales links of the handicraftsmen and fostered serious dependence among the handicraftsmen, but also promoted the serious phenomenon of crude manufacturing and the bad habit of not delivering goods on time, causing the cooperative to overstock a large number of agricultural tools of poor quality that did not meet the needs of farmers. Plows and harrows alone accounted for more than one-half of all orders, while farmer members could not buy suitable plows and harrows. The cooperative's capital turnover also experienced great difficulties. These lessons of the Yiliang County Cooperative Union are worth remembering by all regions.

    Time is very tight. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should actively but accurately expedite the organization of local goods, and strive to do a good job in material supply, complete the procurement tasks given by the state, and meet the needs of farmers.

### 供销合作社应该加紧组织地方手工业货源

    供销合作社应该加紧组织地方手工业货源
    秋季作物快要上市，旺季就要到来。为了保证国家收购棉花和秋粮任务的顺利完成，为了满足农民出售粮食、棉花后购买生产资料和生活资料的需要，各地供销合作社的供应工作，应该立即加强。
    过去收购棉花和粮食的经验证明：什么地方在配合收购工作的同时作好了物资供应工作，就能保证国家规定的价格政策得以实现，农民的利益就会得到保障，收购任务就能顺利完成；如果供求失调，就会给投机商人以可乘之隙，国家的价格政策就要受到破坏，农民的利益就会受到损害，农民对合作社和国家就会不满意，收购任务也就不能很好完成。
    加强供销合作社物资供应工作的中心环节，就是采取积极而有效的措施加紧组织货源，特别是要组织与开辟地方工业与手工业的货源。因为在目前大工业生产还不足的时候，手工业产品，在农村中还占很大比重。各地供销合作社一般都注意了组织大城市的工业产品，但不注意组织地方手工业产品；不少的合作社只愿意经营大城市的“名牌货”或畅销货，不愿意经营零星的复杂的地方手工业产品；许多供销合作社不了解农民社员的需要及手工业产品的产销情况，主观地认为手工业产品质量低、价格高、种类多、需要少，不合经济核算，没有经营条件。因此，对社员所需要的地方手工业产品，至今尚未大量地有计划地引入合作社的零售网中，合作社系统全国省以上二百多个批发站，多以经营上海、天津等大城市工业品的转运业务为主，所以基层社货色不全，商品不足的困难，仍未得到应有的改变。
    应该认识：我国农民目前所需要的生产资料和生活资料，有百分之六十、七十，甚至百分之八十左右，还是依靠城乡手工业品供应的，而农产品也有很大一部分是作为手工业原料销售的。据江西省吉安县吉安镇近郊农村的调查，一个普通的贫农家庭除了消耗的手工业产品如豆豉、棉带、袜子、手巾、土纸、土糖等以外，仅生产工具及生活用具方面的手工业产品就有五十多项，一百数十件，价值共约二百数十万元，而且每年都要增修添补。当地农民家中的财产，除了田地房屋牲畜以外，绝大部分是手工业产品，工业品只占极少数。许多地方的手工业，基本上也是根据当地居民的需要特别是农民的需要而生产的，如石家庄市的手工业产品，就有百分之八十销售在附近各县；山东潍坊市手工业生产的农具，如锄头、镢头、扫帚等，行销本地及省内淄博、莱阳、沂水等县的农村，而且供不应求。事实证明：地方手工业产品是农民社员迫切需要的，合作社应该积极组织地方手工业货源。
    为了积极组织地方工业和手工业货源，各省、县合作社应经省、县财经委员会批准，并与国营商业取得密切联系，于秋收旺季前或旺季中，召开手工业、地方工业和土特产品为主的物资交流会，以便通过样品展览和实际交流，了解和沟通产销情况，为有计划地组织地方货源特别是手工业货源打下基础。在开物资交流会前，应组织力量，对本地手工业、地方工业的产销情况进行必要的调查，加以综合分析，作为指导物资交流的依据，并应广泛地收集样品进行展览，以便参加交流会的合作社比照样品进行交流和签订订货合同。在实际交流中，应根据需要与资金能力，实事求是地签订合同，保证合同执行，防止盲目订货。
    各地供销合作社，应着重与当地手工业者建立联系，订立合同，帮助他们供应原料，推销他们所生产的而又为供销合作社社员所需要的成品，忽视组织地方手工业货源是不对的；但不按照需要和可能，对地方手工业产品一律采取“包干”的办法也是不对的。云南省宜良县合作社联合社和宜良专区贸易公司，不分别不同情况，根据需要和可能，和全县绝大多数的手工业者订立加工合同，手工业者所需要的原料大部由合作社供应，成品不论品种和规格，完全由合作社推销。结果不仅破坏了手工业者原有的采购和推销联系，养成了手工业者严重的依赖思想，而且助长了手工业粗制滥造的严重现象和不按期交货的恶劣习惯，使合作社积压了大量质量不好不合农民需要的农具，单犁耙就积压了全部订货的二分之一以上，而农民社员们却买不到合用的犁耙。合作社的资金周转也发生很大困难。宜良县合作社联合社的这些教训，是值得各地记取的。
    时间十分紧迫了，各地供销合作社应该积极地但必须准确地加紧组织地方货源，为作好物资供应工作，完成国家所给予的收购任务和满足农民的需要而努力。
