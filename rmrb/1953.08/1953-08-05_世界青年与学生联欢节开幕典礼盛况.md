Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 3rd: The Fourth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship opened on August 2nd. A grand opening ceremony was held in the "August 23rd" Cultural and Sports Park Stadium.

	The stadium was packed with people. Conversations and songs in various languages filled the air. National flags of various countries fluttered in the azure sky. In the stands, alongside the national flags, were alternately erected the white festival flags and the blue peace flags.

	The grandstand was adorned with the national emblem of the Romanian People's Republic, with the festival emblem and a banner inscribed with "Peace and Friendship!" in various languages hanging in front. These words served as a call and a pledge.

	When the leaders of the Romanian Workers' Party and the government, headed by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, appeared on the grandstand, the singing and conversations ceased. Trumpets sounded, and the leading parade began to move. At the front of the procession, the white festival flag fluttered. Following them were several young men and women holding the flags of the five major powers.

	Several teams of youth held the flags and emblems of the festival, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the International Union of Students. As the youth delegations from various countries passed the stands, the audience erupted in thunderous applause. The parade, representing 28,000 young men and women from 106 countries, lasted for two hours.

	...The Albanian youth delegation led the way, followed by the Argentine youth. Behind them were youth from Australia, Austria, and Belgium. Behind the flags of Bulgaria, Canada, Ceylon, and Chile, the flag of the People's Republic of China appeared. The audience all stood up, cheered the Chinese guests, and repeatedly shouted "Peace and Friendship!"

	One after another, song and dance troupes and athletes from various countries passed the stands. The French delegation marched past singing the Marseillaise. At the head of a large group of young men and women from the German delegation flew a black, red, and gold flag (the flag of the German Democratic Republic). Then, the British delegation walked past the stage, holding a banner that read "Everything for Peace." They were followed by youth representatives from India and Indonesia. The Indonesian team held a banner that read: "Unite to strive for international peace and friendship." When the sons and daughters of the heroic Democratic People's Republic of Korea appeared, they were greeted with thunderous cheers. Countless flowers were thrown at them, and they were carried past the stage.

	Next to pass were youth representatives from Norway, Pakistan, and Poland. When the red flag of the Soviet Union appeared, the entire audience in the stadium stood up. Soviet young men and women held the Soviet national emblem and the flags and emblems of the various union republics. Throughout the venue, people shouted "Hurrah, the Soviet Union is peace, the Soviet Union is peace and friendship."

	Behind the Soviet delegation walked youth delegations from Spain, Sweden, Tunisia, the United States, Uruguay, and other countries. The audience warmly welcomed the youth representatives from Vietnam.

	At the end of the procession was a team of Romanian youth. The entire stadium resounded with shouts of "Hurrah!" The cheers continued until the team had passed the stage. The entire audience stood up again.

	The cheers of "Peace and Friendship" once again filled the stadium.

	Jacques Denis, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, welcomed the youth delegations from various countries on behalf of the International Preparatory Committee of the Festival.

	He expressed the desire of all young people around the world for peace, saying, you have come here from all parts of the earth, across oceans and mountains. Here we shout in unison: "Peace and Friendship!"

	Jacques Denis continued, the purpose of the festival is to promote the unity of youth and to establish contacts between different youth organizations. On behalf of the delegations from various countries present, Jacques Denis thanked the Romanian people for their assistance in preparing the festival and their hospitality. He said, we are gathered here to declare that young people want to come together to reach agreements so that their hopes can be victorious. We are gathered here to declare that we hope that governments can also gather together to discuss the possibility of resolving all international differences through negotiation. This wish, this belief that negotiation will surely triumph over a policy of force, has become even stronger in these days when people are cheering the Korean armistice, considering it a great victory for the cause of peace throughout the world.

	The second speaker at the festival was Petru Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic. He said that the Romanian people were very happy to welcome the youth from various countries participating in this great gathering for peace, because they have always been happy to do their best to help any measures and any actions aimed at strengthening international peace and friendship.

	Petru Groza continued, you have come here from various regions of the world, you speak various languages, wear various costumes, and have different political views, philosophies, and religious beliefs, but you are all united in the common struggle for peace and friendship. Everything that is happening here and the entire festival will undoubtedly show that friendship and mutual understanding between young people in the world is entirely attainable, and that it is entirely possible for honest people of all countries to maintain friendship and mutual understanding. Peace must and will triumph.

	A team of athletes appeared on the track of the stadium. They were representatives of track and field athletes from the countries through which the international peace and friendship relay race had passed. The leader was Romanian athlete Petru Ciambruesti. He handed the relay baton to Jacques Denis.

	On behalf of the International Preparatory Committee of the Festival, the World Federation of Democratic

    【新华社讯】塔斯社布加勒斯特三日电：第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节于八月二日开幕，在“八月二十三日”文化体育公园运动场举行了盛大的开幕典礼。
    运动场内挤满了人。有着各种语言的谈话与歌声。蔚蓝色的天空飘扬着各国的国旗。看台上，和各国国旗并列，间隔地竖着白色的联欢节会旗与蓝色的和平旗。
    大看台上镶着罗马尼亚人民共和国国徽，前面挂有联欢节的徽章及用各种文字写着“和平与友谊！”的横旗，这几个字像一个号召，也像一句誓言。
    当以格奥尔基·乔治乌—德治为首的罗马尼亚工人党及政府的领袖们在大看台上出现的时候，歌声和谈话声停止了。喇叭声响起来了，领头的游行队伍开始走动。在队伍前面，联欢节的白色会旗在飘动着。跟着，是几个男女青年举着五大国的国旗。
    有几队青年举着联欢节、世界民主青年联盟及国际学联的旗帜和徽章。当各国青年代表团走过看台的时候，观众对他们发出了暴风雨般的鼓掌声。代表一百零六个国家的二万八千青年男女的游行一共进行了二小时。
    ……阿尔巴尼亚青年代表团走在最前面，后面跟着是阿根廷青年。在他们后面的有澳大利亚、奥地利和比利时青年。在保加利亚、加拿大、锡兰和智利的国旗后面，出现了中华人民共和国的国旗。观众们都起立，向中国客人们欢呼，并且不断地高呼着“和平与友谊！”。
    各国歌舞团和运动员的队伍一个接着一个地走过看台。法国代表团唱着马赛曲走过去。德国代表团一大队男女青年的前头飘扬着一面黑色、红色和金黄色的旗帜（德意志民主共和国国旗）。然后，英国代表团走过台前，举着一幅上面写着“一切为和平”的横旗。他们后面跟着印度和印尼的青年代表。印尼队伍举着一幅横旗，写道：“团结起来，争取国际和平与友谊”。英雄的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的儿女们出现时，受到了暴风雨般的欢呼。无数鲜花投向他们，并且把他们抬着走过台前。
    接着走过的是挪威、巴基斯坦和波兰的青年代表。当苏联的红旗出现的时候，整个运动场的观众都站了起来，苏联的青年男女举着苏联国徽和各加盟共和国的国旗和国徽。全场各处都高呼“乌拉，苏联就是和平，苏联就是和平与友谊。”
    苏联代表团后面走着西班牙、瑞典、突尼斯、美国、乌拉圭等国的青年代表团。观众热烈地欢迎越南的青年代表。
    行列的最后面是一队罗马尼亚青年的队伍。整个运动场响起“乌拉！”的欢呼声，欢呼声一直继续着，直到队伍走过了台前。全体观众又站了起来，
    “和平与友谊”的欢呼声又再次充满了运动场。
    世界民主青年联盟总书记雅克·德尼代表联欢节国际筹备委员会向各国青年代表团表示欢迎。
    他表明了全世界所有青年要求和平的愿望，他说，你们从地球的各处，渡过海洋，跨过高山来到此地。我们在此一致高呼：“和平与友谊！”

    第二个在联欢节上发言的是罗马尼亚人民共和国国民议会主席团主席彼得鲁·格罗查。他说，罗马尼亚人民很高兴地欢迎参加这一伟大的和平大集会的各国青年们，因为他们向来就乐于尽力帮助旨在加强国际和平与友谊的任何措施和任何行动。
    彼得鲁·格罗查继续说道，你们从世界的各个地区来到这里，你们讲着各种不同的语言，穿着各式各样的服装，有着不同的政治见解、哲学和宗教信仰，但是你们都团结在争取和平与友谊的共同的斗争中。这里所发生的每一件事以及整个联欢节无疑都会表明，世界上青年人之间的友谊和相互了解是完全可以达得到的，而各国正直人民保持友谊和相互了解也是完全可能做得到的，和平一定要胜利并且一定会胜利。
    一队运动员出现在运动场的跑道上。他们是国际和平友谊接力跑所经过的国家的田径赛运动员代表。领队的是罗马尼亚运动家彼得鲁·查姆布列斯蒂阿努。他把接力跑的短棍交给雅克·德尼。
