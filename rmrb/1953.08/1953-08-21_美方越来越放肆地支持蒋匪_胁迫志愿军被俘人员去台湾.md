    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 20th: Special correspondent reports: The U.S. side is increasingly wantonly supporting and assisting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in its criminal conspiracy to coerce captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel to go to Taiwan.
    According to a report by Agence France-Presse, a person who recently arrived in Seoul from Jeju Island said that in the POW camps on Jeju Island, where captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel are detained, there are pictures of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit and the flags of the Kuomintang bandit gang everywhere. The U.S. POW camp authorities recently also announced the telegram from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit coercing POWs to go to Taiwan. Chiang Kai-shek's special agents are greatly intimidating POWs not to request repatriation, coercing them to go to Taiwan, and continuing to force POWs to tattoo more insulting words on their bodies. This person revealed that after the POWs who are not directly repatriated are handed over to the Indian army for custody, Kuomintang special agents mixed in with the POWs will create "trouble" to obstruct the implementation of the armistice agreement. This person also confirmed that Chiang Kai-shek's special agents are arresting POWs who firmly demand repatriation on a large scale. According to him, eighty captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel who opposed forced detention have been taken away from the POW camp and secretly imprisoned. Another captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel has been killed.
    Chiang Kai-shek's "Foreign Minister" Yeh Kung-chao also openly admitted on the 14th that the Kuomintang bandit gang had been constantly plotting with the United States and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang to forcibly detain captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel who were not directly repatriated. In addition, the Kuomintang bandit gang is mobilizing its big and small minions and puppet organizations to broadcast and send telegrams to captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel, intimidating them not to request repatriation, and instructing Chiang Kai-shek's special agents lurking in the POWs to obstruct and sabotage the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides after the POWs are handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.
    At the same time, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang is stepping up its collusion with and assistance to the Kuomintang bandit gang in forcibly detaining captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel. According to reports, the Syngman Rhee government has made a formal guarantee to the Kuomintang bandit gang, saying that it will do everything possible to forcibly send 14,000 captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel who are not directly repatriated to Taiwan.

    美方越来越放肆地支持蒋匪
    胁迫志愿军被俘人员去台湾
    【新华社开城二十日电】本社特派记者报道：美方正在越来越放肆地支持和协助蒋介石匪帮进行胁迫中国人民志愿军被俘人员去台湾的罪恶阴谋。
    据法新社报道，一个最近从济州岛到达汉城的人说，在济州岛拘留中国人民志愿军被俘人员的战俘营内，到处都是蒋匪介石的像片和国民党匪帮的旗帜。美方战俘营当局最近还公布了蒋匪介石胁迫战俘到台湾去的电文。蒋匪特务正在大肆恫吓战俘不得要求遣返，胁迫他们到台湾去，并且继续强迫战俘在身上刺更多的侮辱性的字句。这个人透露，在不直接遣返的战俘移交给印度军队看管以后，混在战俘中间的国民党特务将制造“麻烦”来阻挠停战协定的实施。这个人还证实了蒋匪特务正在大肆逮捕坚决要求遣返的战俘。据他说，有八十名反对强迫扣留的中国人民志愿军被俘人员已经被从战俘营抓走秘密囚禁起来。另有一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员已经被杀害。
    蒋匪“外交部长”叶公超也在十四日公开承认：国民党匪帮曾不断地与美国和李承晚匪帮策划强迫扣留不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。此外，国民党匪帮并正在动员其大小喽啰和御用组织向中国人民志愿军被俘人员广播和打电报，恫吓他们不得要求遣返，并指使其潜伏在战俘中间的蒋匪特务，在战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会以后，对朝中方面的解释工作进行阻挠和破坏。
    与此同时，李承晚匪帮正在加紧勾结和协助国民党匪帮强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员。有消息说，李承晚政府已向国民党匪帮提出正式保证，说它将尽一切努力把一万四千名不直接遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员强迫送到台湾去。
