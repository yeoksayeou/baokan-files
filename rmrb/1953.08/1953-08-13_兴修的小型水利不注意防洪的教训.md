Lessons from Small-Scale Water Conservancy Construction Neglecting Flood Control
	Jiang Yiqiu Wang Huayan

Liyang County in Jiangsu Province is a region of both hills and polders, with poor agricultural water conservancy conditions, facing threats of both drought and flooding. Therefore, leading agricultural production in Liyang must prioritize flood prevention, flood control, drought prevention, and drought resistance to guarantee a good harvest. In late June, after widespread rainfall across the county, mountain torrents erupted in the northern mountainous areas, and the polder areas experienced waterlogging. One hundred and forty-one large and small ponds and dams were breached or damaged by the mountain floods, and thirty-two large and small polders were breached or submerged. Including the un-embanked beach fields and waterlogged polder fields, the total affected area reached over 100,000 mu. The causes of this flood were, of course, due to the excessive rainfall in the mountainous areas and the fierce mountain torrents. However, after inspection and analysis, the most fundamental issue was the many problems existing in the construction of agricultural water conservancy projects.

Since liberation, Liyang has made significant achievements in agricultural water conservancy construction. In the past four years alone, 2,053 water storage ponds and dams have been built, protecting more than 246,000 mu of farmland from drought. However, due to a lack of clear understanding of the consistency between drought prevention and flood control in the leadership's thinking, the construction of pond and dam projects focused solely on water storage and drought prevention, neglecting flood control. As a result, once mountain torrents erupted, the ponds and dams were washed away, and the land was flooded, not only creating a disaster but also increasing the threat of drought after the flood due to the collapse of the ponds and dams. Under this guiding ideology, most of the water storage dam projects built in Liyang County do not meet standards, except for a very few stone spillway dams. In particular, they lack spillways for regulating water volume. For example, the Meishan Dam in Chaoyang Township, Zhuyu District, which was destroyed this time, had a water accumulation area of more than 1,000 mu of hillside (where water concentrates quickly), while the dam's capacity was only over 100,000 cubic meters. If we calculate based on the seven inches of rainfall this time, the 1,000 mu of water accumulation area, excluding seepage, would have at least 120,000 cubic meters of water concentrating in the dam within a short period (the dam was already full of water before this rainfall). The dam had no spillway in the past. Although a spillway less than one meter deep and wide was opened during the spring repairs this year (according to needs, the dam's spillway should be seven meters wide and one meter deep), and a drainage culvert with a diameter of nine inches was constructed, it was not up to standard. Therefore, after the mountain torrents erupted, the culvert was destroyed, and the floodwaters overflowed the dam embankment, washing away a breach. After the dam failed, the mountain torrents became even fiercer, and the Shenjia, Qiantang, Yangshan, and other dams downstream were quickly washed away. Secondly, before this rainfall, the leading cadres in Liyang County focused on drought prevention and resistance but relaxed the education of the masses on flood prevention and flood control. Some cadres even said: "Now we are so busy with drought resistance and rice transplanting that it is difficult to implement flood prevention and flood control work even if it is arranged. Even if I were farming at home, I wouldn't be able to do it." Some cadres believed that "the river water is very shallow this year, and the polder embankments and dam dikes have been repaired for three or four years, so even if it rains a little, it won't matter much." Therefore, before this rainfall, some villages did not even mention flood prevention and flood control to the masses.

Insufficient mobilization of the masses in the construction of water conservancy projects, especially insufficient technical guidance, resulted in substandard projects. For example, the five larger water storage dams, including Longhu and Wangmujie, which were assisted by central government allocations this spring, still had more than 17,000 cubic meters of earthwork unfinished and no spillways opened due to the lack of leadership attention at the beginning and insufficient mobilization of the masses, with the arrival of the busy farming season. The Longhu Dam in Yanxi Township, Chengnan District, is a large dam benefiting 2,000 mu of farmland. Not only was the earthwork unfinished, and the dam embankment uneven (differing by five or six feet), but there were also errors in technical guidance. For example, the machine sluice gate was built with wood and stone. As a result, after water accumulated, the wood expanded, and the gate piston could not be pulled up, and the masses did not know how to use it. After this rainfall, the sluice gate was damaged in an emergency, causing almost all the dam water to be released, and it could not be blocked.

Flood prevention and flood control organizations are incomplete. The county's flood prevention and drought resistance headquarters was only established after the flood formed on June 25th. The flood prevention and flood control organizations at the district, township, and village levels were also not rectified and improved. The original organizations were mostly ineffective. In particular, projects spanning districts and townships created a situation where no one was responsible, resulting in unnecessary losses. For example, the Gongyou Dahan polder in Houzhou Township, Piqiao District, and Xiamei Township, Zhuyu District, was completely flooded because no one was responsible. Although the mountain ponds and dams have water management organizations during drought resistance, the focus of these organizations is on rational water use and resolving water disputes. They were not prepared for flood prevention at all, so they were helpless once mountain torrents erupted. There was even less attention paid to upstream and downstream coordination, care for high-lying fields versus low-lying fields, and mutual support.

Lack of inspection system and insufficient preparation of materials. The flood prevention and rescue materials directly prepared by the county leadership organs were not only insufficient in quantity but also not transported to the construction site in advance. The piles of wood allocated to Xiamei and Wangzhu Townships in Zhuyu District were not moved in time, and the polder embankment was breached. The masses themselves were even less prepared for flood prevention and rescue materials. These situations were largely not inspected in advance, and even if some were inspected, they were not corrected. For example, the Gongyou Dazhen (more than 2,000 mu) in Majia and other townships in Nandu District did not even prepare the gate panels for the newly built large sluice gate and had to borrow them during the rescue.

The facts have educated us that mountain torrents destroy ponds and dams and inevitably affect drought prevention. Therefore, in the future, we must pay great attention to flood control when constructing agricultural water conservancy and pay attention to projects that regulate water volume in pond and dam projects. At present, Liyang County is mobilizing the masses to inspect the causes and summarize the experience and lessons learned to lay an ideological foundation for future water conservancy construction. At the same time, it is actively leading the masses to repair polders, drain waterlogging, and continue to strengthen flood prevention, drought prevention, and drought resistance work.

    兴修的小型水利不注意防洪的教训
    姜挹秋  王化彦
    江苏溧阳县是半山半圩地区，农田水利条件很差，旱涝威胁都存在着。因此在溧阳领导农业生产，首先必须作好防汛、防洪和防旱、抗旱工作，才能保证丰收。六月下旬，全县普遍落雨后，北面山区山洪暴发，圩乡发生内涝，被山洪冲破或冲坏大小塘坝一百四十一个，冲破或淹没大小圩三十二个，加上无埂滩田及内涝圩田等共受灾田达十万余亩。形成这次水灾的原因，固然是由于山区落雨太大，山洪太猛，但经检查分析，最基本的还是在修建农田水利工程中存在许多问题。
    解放后，溧阳在兴修农田水利方面是有很大的成绩。四年来，仅蓄水塘坝就修建了二千零五十三个，使二十四万六千多亩农田免受旱灾。但由于领导思想上对防旱与防洪的一致性认识不明确，在修建塘坝工程时单纯地着眼于蓄水防旱，不注意防洪，以致一旦山洪暴发，塘坝被冲垮，土地被淹没，不仅形成了水灾，而且在洪水过后，由于塘坝被冲垮，又增加了旱灾的威胁。在这种思想指导下，在溧阳县已修建的塘坝工程中，除极少数的石工滚水坝外，绝大部分的蓄水坝工程不合标准，特别是没有调节水量的溢洪道。如这次被冲毁的竹箦区朝阳乡梅山坝，积水面积有一千多亩山坡（水集中的很快），坝身容量仅十万多立方公尺，如果以这次落雨七市寸计算，一千亩积水面积除去渗透至少就有十二万立方公尺水在很短的时间内集中到坝内（这次落雨前坝内已积满了水）。该坝过去没有溢洪道，今年春修时虽然开辟了一条深、宽都不足一公尺的溢洪道（按需要，该坝溢洪道需七公尺宽，一公尺深）和直径九市寸的放水涵洞，但不够标准。因此山洪暴发后涵洞被冲毁，洪水漫过坝埂，冲倒了一个缺口。该坝出险后山洪更猛，下面的沈家、乾塘、扬山等坝跟着很快都被冲垮。其次是这次落雨前，溧阳县的领导干部抓住了防旱抗旱，却放松了对群众作防洪防汛的教育。个别干部并说：“现在抗旱插秧这样忙，防汛防洪工作布置了也很难行得通，就是我在家种田，我也不行。”有的干部认为“今年河水很浅，圩埂、坝堤经过三四年的修建，就是落点雨也没多大关系”。因此在这次落雨前部分乡村在群众中对防汛防洪连提也没提过。
    在兴修水利工程中发动群众不够，特别是技术指导不够，致使工程不合标准。如今春经中央拨款协助的龙虎、王母岕等五个较大的蓄水坝，由于领导干部开始抓的不紧，群众发动的不充分，农忙季节到来还有一万七千多土方工程未完成，溢洪道未开辟。城南区燕西乡的龙虎坝是两千亩受益田的大坝，不仅土方工程未完成，坝埂高低不平（相差五、六尺），而且在技术指导上有错误。例如机器放水闸是用木料和石头筑成的，结果积水后，木料发生膨胀，闸门活塞拔不起来，群众又不会使用。这次落雨后，在紧急情况下把水闸搞坏了，使坝水几乎全部放光了，也无法堵塞。
    防汛、防洪组织不健全。县防汛抗旱总队部是在六月二十五日水灾形成后才建立起来的，区、乡、村的防汛防洪组织也未整顿健全，原有组织又大部分不起作用，特别是跨区跨乡的工程，更形成无人负责的现象，以致造成了不应有的损失。如甓桥区后周乡和竹箦区下梅乡公有大垾圩，就是因为无人负责，结果圩内五百多亩田全部被淹掉。山区塘坝在抗旱中虽都建有塘坝管理组织，但这些组织掌握的重点是合理用水，解决抢水纠纷，对防洪没有丝毫准备，以致一旦山洪暴发，就束手无策，至于上下游联系，高田对低田的照顾和互相支援等更做得不够。
    缺乏检查制度，器材准备不够。县领导机关直接准备的防汛抢险器材，不仅数量上不足，而且事前未运到工地。竹箦区下梅、王渚等乡分配到的桩木没有来得及搬运，圩埂就冲破了。群众自己对防汛抢险器材准备更差。这些情况事前大都没有进行检查，个别检查了也没有改正，如南渡区马家等乡公有大圩（二千多亩），新修的大水闸连闸板都没有准备，直至抢险时还是借用的。
    事实教育了我们，山洪暴发，塘坝被冲毁，又必然影响防旱，因此今后在修建农田水利时必须十分重视防洪工作，注意塘坝工程上调节水量的工程，目前溧阳县正在一面发动群众检查原因，总结经验教训，为今后兴修水利打下思想基础；一面积极领导群众修圩、排涝，继续加强防汛和防旱抗旱工作。
