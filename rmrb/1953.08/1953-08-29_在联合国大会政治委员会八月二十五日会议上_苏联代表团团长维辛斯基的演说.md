In these days, our committee has been discussing the Korean question. The discussion has focused on two main issues. First, the form of the conference and the organizational principles it should follow. Second, the composition of the conference.

The drafters of the fifteen-nation proposal, led by the United States, maintain their proposal and Article 5(a) of the proposal, which stipulates that the political conference should be organized on the basis of the participation of representatives of the belligerent countries. In the discussion, they particularly emphasized the need to strictly comply with the provisions of paragraph 60 of the Armistice Agreement. They pointed out that the provisions of paragraph 60 are the only – as they said – legitimate principles to be followed in dealing with this issue.

Needless to say, paragraph 60 must be strictly observed. This is a very clear requirement that should be observed not only by the countries that signed the Armistice Agreement, but by all countries. Moreover, not only paragraph 60 of the Armistice Agreement should be observed, but the entire agreement.

The U.S. representative, who took the lead in proposing this proposal, tried his best to utilize the provisions of paragraph 60. He attempted to prove that Article 5(a) of the fifteen-nation proposal conforms exactly to the provisions of paragraph 60, like mathematics, and that taking any other position on the issues of the method, form, and conditions for the composition of the political conference would mean violating, or at least disregarding, the provisions of paragraph 60. In order to support the position of a bilateral conference, Mr. Lodge mentioned General Nam Il's statement in his speech on August 19. According to Lodge, General Nam Il said that one side of the conference should represent North Korea and the volunteer army of Communist China, and the other side should represent the governments of countries that placed troops under the command of the United Nations.

Mr. Lodge drew two conclusions from this statement attributed to General Nam Il: First, the political conference to discuss the Korean question must include two sides. Second, the conference must be composed of representatives appointed by both sides and supporting one side of the belligerents.

These are the two conclusions drawn by Mr. Lodge from his citation of General Nam Il's statement, and this is how he interprets the meaning of Article 4, paragraph 60 of the Armistice Agreement.

I will try to prove, at least try to prove, that neither the first nor the second conclusion drawn by Mr. Lodge can be deduced from paragraph 60. It is impossible to draw these two conclusions, whether from the strict legal meaning of the above clause, or, stepping back, from its strict political meaning.

We have always believed, and I still believe, that the conclusion that the conference must be composed of both sides cannot be drawn from paragraph 60 simply because both sides are to appoint their representatives. Nor can the conclusion be drawn from paragraph 60 that the two sides that signed the Armistice Agreement and appointed representatives in accordance with paragraph 60 can only appoint representatives from the sixteen participating countries, leaving behind at least forty-four other United Nations member states; and the three-year war of the United States and its allies against the Korean people was carried out under the banner of the United Nations and in the name of the United Nations. It is impossible to draw the first conclusion from paragraph 60, nor is it possible to draw the second conclusion.

As for the statement of General Nam Il that he mentioned, it should be pointed out that Xinhua News Agency once reported that it was also fully confirmed in the official report of the United Nations Command on October 18, 1952 (Document A/2228, page 12). In his statement on February 19, 1952, General Nam Il's explanation of the term "relevant governments of both sides" is the same as the understanding of the Korean and Chinese sides now.

General Nam Il said that he believes that the meaning of this phrase is: the relevant governments on the side of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the relevant governments on the side of the United Nations Command.

However, this is completely different from what Mr. Lodge attributed to General Nam Il. However, we do not care about this at all now, we are now discussing the issue of the composition of the conference. Indeed, things should be very clear: how to understand the term "relevant countries" is one thing, and who should represent these countries at the conference is another.

We are all familiar with paragraph 60 of the agreement. This paragraph does say that the representatives of the political conference will be appointed by both sides, but this cannot be interpreted as meaning that these representatives must only be citizens of these two sides, as the drafters of the fifteen-nation proposal believe and as the U.S. delegation most stubbornly insists.

The error of the U.S. delegation and some other delegations that support it lies in: they narrowly define the scope of paragraph 60 with their most arbitrary interpretation, and the wording of this paragraph can never allow such an interpretation.

Today, what Mr. Spender, the Australian representative, said clearly shows this error. He openly said that we must adhere to the letter of this clause. For him, the meaning of this clause and the meaning of the entire Armistice Agreement do not exist. What he needs is the "letter". And he thought that adhering to the "letter" would make a legal interpretation, forgetting that hair-splitting and legal interpretation are completely different things. He forgot that, on the contrary, the correct legal interpretation is fundamentally completely different from merely adhering to the literal wording of the clause, because legal interpretation requires logical, political, and moral judgments, and of course also requires an understanding of the overall content, the overall trend of the clauses, or, as jurists usually say, requires an understanding of the spirit of the clauses, or, more accurately, the essence of these clauses. Otherwise, a correct interpretation cannot be made of individual clauses, nor of the entire agreement.

The Australian representative ignored all of this and only mentioned the letter of paragraph 60. However, almost no one in the Political Committee supported such an interpretation. Mr. Naszkowski, the head of the Polish delegation, was right. He said that, in fact, apart from Lodge and some of his followers, no one supported this position, nor did anyone defend the indefensible attempt to interpret paragraph 60 of the Armistice Agreement in such a way that is clearly detrimental to the current situation. Representatives of many countries that usually support the U.S. position are now opposing the U.S. position on this issue. We believe they are right.

I cannot but mention the speech of the French representative. He said that the wording of the proposal in paragraph 60 should not be "too literal." He also said that "all parties that can effectively participate in the negotiations should be invited."

Therefore, the only correct conclusion that can be drawn is: --I must repeat Mr. Schuman's words-- the conference should not become a conference of two opposing camps, "on the contrary, this conference should pave the way for a common discussion of current issues." As I understand it, the British delegation took the same attitude. As Mr. Lloyd said, they believed that they saw a certain degree of common ground in the Soviet delegation's proposal regarding the members of the conference. As I understand it, this common ground is that the British delegation also opposes the narrow interpretation of paragraph 60 and advocates holding a broader political conference, rather than a political conference only attended by countries that have sent troops to Korea.

Of course, I would like to point out in passing that Mr. Lloyd was wrong in some of his remarks. He said that the Soviet Union wants to arbitrarily decide which of the countries that sent troops to Korea under the command of General Clark should participate in the conference. This is not true, because we are only making suggestions, and the way in which this suggestion is made does not give any reason to doubt that we are acting arbitrarily. If we adopt this attitude, any suggestion made by any delegation can be said to be arbitrary!

The Egyptian representative also talked about allowing representatives of small Asian countries to participate in the conference as widely as possible. He said that this would "help the great powers establish genuine conditions for peace." He hoped that the participating countries would not participate in the conference with the aim of maintaining colonial interests in the countries of the Asian continent.

I think this is a correct statement, although I am not as optimistic as the Egyptian representative in this regard.

Many representatives have expressed that the Soviet Union and India must participate in the conference, and therefore refused to support the U.S. proposal for a bilateral conference.

So, what is the result? The result is: the vast majority of representatives believe that the U.S. and the other fifteen delegations have misinterpreted paragraph 60, and their entire position on this issue is wrong. Only the U.S. and its partners believe that their interpretation of paragraph 60 and their position are correct. Therefore, it is no wonder that the U.S. representative wants to shift the main force for maintaining their position outside the conference hall. They hope to achieve their goal in this way, as our proverb says: "If you can't earn it, steal it."

Now, let's go back to paragraph 60 of the Armistice Agreement. It must be pointed out that this clause does not explicitly stipulate the issue of the composition of the political conference.

In order to oppose the participation of Korea's neighbors in the political conference, Mr. Lodge said: their participation may turn the conference into a conference similar to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, including representatives from sixty countries. Mr. Lodge's remarks are not only unfounded, but they do not even qualify as serious remarks. Because our proposal clearly states that this matter is primarily and most relevant to Korea's neighbors, there is no question of a political conference being similar to a Political Committee including sixty countries. Mr. Lodge's kind of remark cannot be considered at all.

However, how should paragraph 60, which stipulates a "bilateral" conference and the "bilateral" appointment of representatives to attend the conference, be interpreted?

If we study the fifteen-nation proposal, especially Article 5(a), which very arbitrarily limits the members of the conference to countries that have provided troops in the war and South Korea, and compare it with paragraph 60, then the differences between Article 5(a) and paragraph 60 become very clear. In fact, paragraph 60 does not mention those countries that have transferred troops to the command of the United Nations Command. Paragraph 60 does not say that only those countries that have sent troops to participate in the Korean War can participate in the conference. Of course, without the participation of these countries that participated in the war, it is impossible to imagine holding a conference to discuss issues related to the war they waged and to deal with the establishment of peace that followed after the signing of the Armistice Agreement. However, does this mean that only these countries can participate in the conference? I hope that those who judge this matter only from the letter and not from the meaning can find this point in paragraph 60 for me. They cannot find it, because this point does not exist at all.

The fifteen-nation proposal, which is obviously contradictory to paragraph 60, makes it impossible for all countries that cannot be listed as belligerents, including Korea's neighbors who did not participate in the Korean War, to participate in the conference; although no one can deny that these countries (I am referring to Korea's neighbors) are very concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and no one can deny that the participation of these countries in the political conference is very important.

The Soviet proposal avoids extreme measures. On the one hand, we believe that the members of the conference must be limited to a smaller number in order to avoid the difficulties caused by the participation of many countries.

On the other hand, we believe that the conference must also include—I emphasize this point—and not only include those countries that have not participated in the war, especially Korea's neighbors.

I should say that when the peaceful settlement of a country's problems is being debated, that country's neighbor (I am referring to a peaceful neighbor) is of course more concerned about this matter than a country thousands of kilometers away—this is a universal truth.

Given the current situation, how can we even think of excluding countries that are neighbors of Korea from the conference to deal with such an important issue as the peaceful settlement of the Korean question? However, some of the countries participating in the Korean War insist that only they can participate in the political conference, and that Korea's neighbors must be excluded from the conference because they have not provided troops. According to this, on the one hand: any government that participated in armed intervention and participated in the massacre of peaceful Korean residents can be allowed to participate in the political conference as a reward. On the other hand: take India, for example, which did not send troops to Korea and did not participate in armed intervention, cannot have a seat at the conference. This unwillingness to allow India to participate in the political conference is justified by various far-fetched interpretations of paragraph 60—psychological, legal, and so on.

We believe that in terms of politics and practicality, there are not only completely legitimate reasons to accommodate the Soviet Union's participation in the conference (the vast majority of representatives on the Political Committee believe this is correct), but also reasons to accommodate countries like India (which has made a huge contribution to the efforts of peace-loving countries to end the Korean War) as well as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Burma, Indonesia, and several other countries that are concerned about consolidating peace. These countries have spent considerable efforts in these years to end rather than prolong the Korean War.

Some delegations, primarily the U.S. delegation, which plays an important role in this discussion, are attempting to deny that it is appropriate to invite India and many other neutral countries to participate in the upcoming conference on Korea. We believe this attempt is unfounded.

It must be pointed out that the U.S. representative to the Political Committee did not initially oppose India's participation. According to newspaper reports, it was not until August 20 that Lodge expressed his opposition to India's participation. At that time, he announced outside the United Nations that the United States would vote against India's participation in the political conference on the Korean issue. It is very strange that just when Lodge made this statement, Syngman Rhee announced: if India is invited to participate in the conference, South Korea will not participate! As U.S. newspapers have publicly announced, the main reason for the U.S. opposition to India's participation in the conference is said to be Syngman Rhee's aforementioned remarks. In addition, U.S. newspapers even said that the U.S. opposition to India's participation in the conference is supposedly because it violates paragraph 60 of the Armistice Agreement, an explanation that is given to the broad masses of the people.

In reality, the United States has colluded with South Korea to formulate a strategy and overall plan of action regarding the members of the conference. The United States' approach has not even received the consent of its allies in the Korean War. Of course, it is hard to believe that Syngman Rhee would dare to disregard his own danger and threaten to boycott the political conference. Not only Syngman Rhee, but none of the countries that stood on the U.S. side in the Korean War would dare to do so.

Lodge denied that the United States and South Korea had a secret agreement. However, the entire British press is clamoring about such a secret agreement. The "Daily Herald," which is usually very well-informed on the secret affairs of Western diplomacy, said in its report on the agreement between Syngman Rhee and Robertson that it is no coincidence that this agreement is shrouded in an unpleasant and dangerous atmosphere of mystery. There is no doubt that the whole thing is not without that unpleasant and dangerous mysterious nature. In this regard, it should be pointed out that Rhee's so-called Foreign Minister, Pyun Yung-tae, recently boasted that Rhee had gained 60 percent more from the negotiations with Robertson than he had originally hoped for. In fact, he got twice as much as he asked for. If we remember Dulles' remarks, especially those openly encouraging the warlike plans of their South Korean protege, then this accommodating attitude of the U.S. State Department is easily explained.

These facts cannot be easily let go. They are serious enough to be dealt with seriously. They raise certain fears about the fate of the upcoming conference.

The Political Committee cannot ignore everything related to the future of the political conference to discuss the Korean issue, that is, everything related to issues such as the political atmosphere, the political situation, and especially the facts of those plans to sabotage this conference that are almost being drafted before our eyes. These facts raise serious concerns about the upcoming political conference.

Even Mr. Spender, the Australian representative who was flattering Syngman Rhee, had to admit in his speech on August 18 that Syngman Rhee's belligerent attitude greatly disturbed the Australian government and people, and the governments and people of other countries. Although he admitted this with reservations. And I would even say that he even apologized for daring to touch on this issue. Everyone who truly values the fate of this conference, everyone who believes that the political conference is a great step forward (a serious step in resolving all the outstanding issues) is worried about its future.

Words, mild wishes, and good advice are not enough. More effective measures are needed to eliminate the threat of new provocations, which are fraught with the danger of rekindling the war. Among these measures, the first is to organize the political conference correctly, so as to ensure that those sitting at the conference table—we call this conference a "round table conference"—are not intent on sabotaging the conference, are not intent on acting like armies facing each other, ready to eliminate the other party at any time, but are prepared to find a common language, prepared to achieve peace in Korea, the Far East, and the world through consultation, and prepared to eliminate the threat of a new world war that the Korean situation has foreshadowed.

This is a very important issue, and therefore, we cannot ignore various signs indicating that someone is preparing to sabotage the conference. Some people believe that in order to ensure the smooth and peaceful resolution of such an important issue as the Korean issue, it is absolutely correct and necessary to gather the strength of all truly peace-loving countries to stop the warlike adventurers and ensure a necessary political atmosphere and political situation that is in line with the peaceful task of the conference. We fully agree with the opinions of these people. This is the main and fundamental responsibility of the United Nations!

However, some representatives are trying every means to complicate the political situation, believing that this is their main goal in preparing for this political conference.

These representatives issue deceptive statements, blatantly distort historical facts, want to make the political atmosphere tense, and use the poison of slander and hatred to undermine the political atmosphere.

We cannot ignore the speeches of some representatives. They are spreading here the deceptive lies about "aggression from the North" that have long been refuted, and they are spreading these lies with an unusually arrogant attitude.

These representatives cannot provide any facts or any evidence to support these lies, and they are desperately disregarding the evidence that we put forward as early as 1950 and the facts of the following years. These evidences and facts all reveal who the real aggressor is. These representatives repeat the old tune about aggression from North Korea over and over again, while in fact North Korea itself was the victim of the attacks launched by the South Korean government with the participation and guidance of foreign interventionists.

For years, the protectors of the Syngman Rhee regime stubbornly rejected all the proposals put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides and supported by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries to end the Korean War and to achieve a ceasefire in Korea (as the primary requirement for promoting the cause of peace—which was then a ceasefire); they stubbornly delayed the destructive war in Korea, causing heavy losses of life, bringing incalculable disasters to the Korean people, and inflicting serious wounds on the countries of those young people who were driven by the interventionists to the Far East to conquer North Korea for Syngman Rhee and his protectors. Now, they are pretending to be saddened by the victims of the war that they themselves launched! At the same time, they are trying to make it seem as if their true intention is to unify Korea peacefully. They have only forgotten one thing, that there is countless evidence revealing their completely contrary intentions and plans, not only their plans, but also the actions they have actually taken and are taking.

Their so-called "unification" of Korea is nothing more than a deceptive disguise for the criminal plan to destroy the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and expand the traitorous and reactionary regime of South Korea to North Korea. They are trying to cover up these criminal plans with the slogan of "unifying" Korea, but in reality, the essence of the matter is completely different! The essence of the matter is to resume the war against North Korea in order to eliminate the democratic system in North Korea and make North Korea submit to the current South Korean government.

I have to remind you of these facts, because some representatives have made statements about the issue of aggression that cannot but be retorted with indignation. I must state in advance that I would rather talk about the measures taken by both sides to organize the political conference effectively and to produce positive results, rather than talk about this point. However, one cannot ignore this point. However, since we have been attacked here from all sides, I must remind you, and for the sake of brevity, only cite some facts. Here are:

The first fact. An annex to the 1949 report of the United Nations Commission states that the South Korean government opposed any proposal to unify Korea except—as the United Nations report says—its own proposal. From the materials of the same committee of the United Nations, one can see what the proposals of South Korea are. In the final analysis, these proposals are to conquer North Korea by force and incorporate North Korea into South Korea.

The committee pointed out—I am quoting this document—“President (Syngman Rhee), the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and other important and influential politicians often make statements saying that time is constantly passing, and when there is no other way, using force to seek unification may be the last resort that has to be taken.”

This was said as early as 1949, and it was recognized by the United Nations Commission.

Does this fact not illustrate that there is a plan to conquer North Korea? Was it not the so-called "officials" of this "president" and the so-called "South Korean government" who were pursuing a war against North Korea as early as 1949?

The second fact. The Syngman Rhee faction is unwilling to negotiate with the North Koreans on the peaceful unification of Korea. For example, on the first anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly's recognition of the so-called Republic of Korea (that is, South Korea) government, the then-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea "hoped that the residents would make every effort...to realize the unification of the entire Korea before December 12 next year." He also said, "The people are determined to do so and are prepared to shed blood." Syngman Rhee also said: "When the inevitable opportunity comes, we are afraid that it will be difficult to avoid bloodshed and civil war. If we fail to achieve unification this year, we will have to seek the unification of our motherland with our own efforts." At the same time, he also said: "We have to shed blood, we cannot avoid civil war..." This shows who provoked the civil war in the end! The so-called South Korean government, while carrying out terrorist massacres of progressive democratic people in South Korea who support the establishment of an independent, democratic, and unified Korea, was preparing to attack North Korea, as pointed out in the documents of the United Nations Commission. This can also be seen from Rhee's letter in 1949.

The third fact. Syngman Rhee wrote in a letter: "I would now like to briefly tell you about our current situation. I firmly believe that now is the most psychologically advantageous time to take offensive steps and unite the part of the North Korean Communist army that is loyal to us in order to annihilate the rest." He wrote in this letter: "We will drive a part of the people under Kim Il-sung into the mountains and let them starve to death there. Then our defense line will be extended to the Tumen River and the Yalu River. Our position will also be a hundred times better than it is now." This is what this gentleman has said. He is prepared to starve to death those North Korean residents who are fighting to defend their young democratic people's republic. He wants to drive the North Koreans into the mountains to starve. This is what Syngman Rhee wrote in 1949. What happened later? In 1950, Rhee's gang, with the support of their American protectors, began to implement this horrifying plan.

The fourth fact. We cite Zhao Bingyu's letter to Syngman Rhee. Zhao Bingyu was the South Korean ambassador to the United States, Syngman Rhee's confidant, and the closest assistant of Syngman Rhee's agents here. He wrote: "I am convinced that the unification of Korea can only be achieved by exercising the sovereignty of our government." What does this sentence mean? If they do not resort to force, how can Rhee's gang use his "sovereignty" to unify North Korea into its territory? Zhao Bingyu stated: "Any policy of compromise or negotiation will not work. The Cold War cannot last forever. Without a third world war, all these world problems cannot be resolved. Our unification plan must adapt to the development of the entire international situation. The most important task of the government at present is to strengthen our military and economic preparations."

The fifth fact. On July 29 this year, Syngman Rhee said: "If the Communists refuse to agree to the unification of Korea, then it is inconceivable that the United States will not resume the Korean War." Is this kind of clamor against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea not very obviously provocative? Especially since everyone knows that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always advocated the peaceful unification of Korea and strived to establish a unified, democratic, and independent Korea. Therefore, is the provocative nature of this kind of clamor not very obvious?

The sixth fact. Yesterday, Rhee's representative said here: "It is said that the Armistice Agreement should not be limited by time. Any action by the Republic of Korea that undermines the division between the North and the South stipulated in the Armistice Agreement will be condemned as violating the provisions of the Armistice. Moreover, such an action will be treated as severely as an act of aggression." It is very clear that only those who are prepared to undermine the Armistice Agreement under the pretext of eliminating the division of the country would say this. According to him, he foresaw this possibility and expressed his regret, that is: "The Republic of Korea may be abandoned and criticized if it tries to independently do what the United Nations and the Republic of Korea have tried to accomplish together without the help of outsiders." In other words, the so-called South Korean government is afraid that it will be abandoned if it wants to independently do what it has tried to do together with the United Nations in the war. Yesterday, Syngman Rhee's spokesman stated that if things do not proceed at the political conference according to Rhee's path, which is obviously agreed upon by the American reactionary clique, then the South Korean "government" will continue to plan to resume the war.

There are many facts of this kind. I have only talked about some of them. However, even these facts are enough to illustrate the true situation of the war imposed on the Korean people.

Now let's talk about the issues directly related to the political conference. A few days ago, I pointed out in my speech to the Political Committee that the United Nations has the absolute and indisputable right to make recommendations on any issues related to maintaining and consolidating peace and international security. There is no doubt that the issue of the members of the political conference to discuss the Korean issue is also included in these issues. Because the political conference is not only of great significance to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but also of great significance to the entire cause of maintaining and consolidating peace and international security. Making recommendations on such issues is not only the right of the United Nations General Assembly, but also its obligation. Article 11 of the United Nations Charter, especially paragraph 2 thereof, authorizes the General Assembly to do this work, which states that it must discuss "any question relating to the maintenance of international peace and security" and make recommendations on any such question.

From this, I would like to talk about another issue. As everyone knows, the armed interventionists insist that the armed intervention is a collective action of the United Nations against "North Korea's aggression." As everyone knows, the command of the sixteen participating countries in this armed intervention is flying the flag of the United Nations and using the name of the United Nations. The military actions against the Korean people that began in June 1950 were said to be military actions carried out by the "United Nations." The word "United Nations" is touted on every occasion. However, when the question arises of which United Nations member states have the right to participate in the political conference on the Korean issue, those countries that did not participate in the Korean War under the leadership of the United States are opposed to participating. In this way, some countries that fought in Korea are trying to monopolize the right to participate in the conference on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, denying other members of the United Nations the right to participate in this conference. There is no doubt that those member states that are more concerned about resolving the Korean issue than many countries participating in the aforementioned group are refused to participate in the conference. It is not difficult to prove that this situation is unreasonable and incompatible with the international prestige and dignity of the United Nations. It does not need special explanation, and everyone knows how incompatible this situation is with the basic principle of equal rights of United Nations member states and with the basic meaning of democracy. Because some delegations are forcing the vast majority of United Nations member states to accept their will, that is, to accept the will of the American reactionary clique. They disregard the opinions of others and disrespect the dignity of other members of the United Nations. The Australian representative wanted to prove in today's speech that it is not the business of the United Nations to recommend the members of the political conference, and for this reason, he quoted General Nam Il. According to him, General Nam Il said during the negotiations at Panmunjom: "There is no basis for using the word United Nations during the negotiations." Nam Il went on to say: "This is incorrect because the countries fighting against the Korean people cannot truly represent the United Nations, and in fact, many United Nations member states did not participate in the Korean War." However, this quotation does not in any way illustrate the point that Mr. Spender wants to illustrate.

Nam Il pointed out that the group of sixteen countries fighting in Korea is actually not the United Nations organization, because there are forty-four other countries that did not fight in Korea. This statement is completely correct. Although some of these countries approved of this war and even voted in favor of the corresponding resolution declaring North Korea as an aggressor, this situation cannot explain anything, because many of these countries were obviously forced to embark on this tragic path. The Australian representative believes that the United Nations organization cannot recommend its own representatives to participate in the political conference—as he said in today's speech—but can suggest that they be members of this side or that side of the conference. However, this is completely incorrect. The United Nations organization should see its task not in supplementing the representatives of this side or that side who signed the Armistice Agreement and participated in the war, but in recommending the members of the conference itself, regardless of whether these recommended countries will belong to this side or that side. The political conference should be organized according to the form of a "round table" conference. The General Assembly and the entire United Nations organization should and can recommend the members that make up the conference itself, rather than recommend to the conference to supplement the representatives of this side or that side of the belligerents. Therefore, it is not permissible to select the members of the conference according to the principle of sympathizing with this side or that side of the belligerents. If we embark on this path, then the United Nations organization will never be able to ensure that the conference will have members who can truly and correctly resolve the problems facing the conference in a political and practical way. Since the United Nations General Assembly claims to be an international organization, a peaceful organization, not an organization of war, it cannot select the participants of such a conference from the point of view of who is its friend and who is not its friend when it recommends such a conference. Mr. Lloyd said here: "We cannot but invite our friends to participate in this conference." If a conference is organized according to this principle, wanting to protect its many relatives and friends, then any international conference cannot be held. In this way, the conference will not yield any results.

Therefore, it is necessary to reiterate that U.S. President Eisenhower stated in his speech on April 16 this year that he was prepared to turn the United Nations into an institution that can effectively defend peace and the security of all countries and peoples. As everyone knows, as stated in the preamble of the United Nations Charter, the main purpose of establishing the United Nations is to strengthen peace and international security. But in order for the United Nations to be competent in the cause of strengthening peace and international security, all of its member states must abide by the principles of the Charter, and no government should try to turn the United Nations into an auxiliary agency for its own foreign policy. Now, if we look at the U.S. proposal—the proposal of the fifteen-nation delegation headed by the U.S. delegation, it should be said that this proposal is a new example of that attempt to treat the United Nations as an auxiliary agency for U.S. foreign policy. The "fifteen-nation proposal" is a special order issued by the fifteen-nation delegation headed by the United States to the entire United Nations. The position of the group headed by the United States on the members of the political conference proves that they have ignored this simple fact: the success or failure of the conference depends on whether those countries that are very concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue participate in the conference. This must be understood, and we must act in accordance with this completely indisputable principle.

Finally, I think it is necessary to talk about the criticisms of the Soviet proposal by others, especially the criticism of the last sentence of our proposal. Mr. Lloyd talked about this point in our proposal with particular care. The first thing I want to point out is that Lloyd agrees that this conference should not solve problems by counting votes, should not have voting procedures, or, as he clearly stated, the voting factor can be eliminated. I think it is more accurate to say that the voting factor should be eliminated. Lloyd also said that the fact that the political conference will not have voting procedures and that the voting factor can be eliminated is a common idea "among us," that is, obviously among all the countries that proposed the fifteen-nation proposal. However, Lloyd does not agree that decisions can only be adopted if they are agreed upon by both sides to the agreement, as our proposal indicates. In other words, Lloyd insists on the position that the conference can adopt decisions without the consent of both sides to the Armistice Agreement. When discussing this issue, Mr. Lloyd said that he believes that there may be several different understandings of the aforementioned point in our proposal. According to Lloyd's opinion, these different understandings boil down to the following: South Korea is excluded from the countries that enjoy the rights guaranteed by our proposal (which Lloyd calls "veto power"). It should be explained that none of the "various understandings" made of our proposal has any basis, because we do not believe that South Korea can be excluded from this conference, as Mr. Lloyd made an incorrect interpretation of our proposal. The Soviet delegation's proposal on the political conference is absolutely not based on some temporary principles, but on the serious basic principles of its own foreign policy. One of the principles used to deal with this issue is: we must start from this point (and the Soviet Union is now starting from this point), that the participation of North Korea and South Korea as main members in the political conference is inevitable, and this is self-evident. We do not deny South Korea's right as such a participant; the consent of these participants is necessary for the adoption of conference resolutions. The principle that we advocate that the resolutions of the conference can only be adopted with the unanimous consent of both sides to the Armistice Agreement means that any resolution of the conference must be approved unanimously by both sides to the Armistice Agreement in order to be adopted. Therefore, it is incorrect to interpret our position on the political conference on the Korean issue as meaning that the conference can adopt resolutions without the consent of South Korea. Because this makes no sense politically or practically. The Soviet Union's principled position on the Korean issue is determined by this principle: the Koreans, that is, the representatives of North Korea and South Korea, should solve their internal affairs themselves. As can be seen from the statement made yesterday by Mr. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, he also takes such a position. The statement of Mr. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, fairly pointed out several very important principles. Because today's newspapers in New York are inaccurate in their reports on Zhou Enlai's statement, I think it is necessary to repeat the main principles of this statement according to the original text of the statement broadcast by Xinhua News Agency. Mr. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, said that, one, "In order for the political conference to proceed harmoniously, so as to establish a model for the peaceful consultation and resolution of disputes in international affairs, the political conference should take the form of a round table conference,

    在联合国大会政治委员会八月二十五日会议上
    苏联代表团团长维辛斯基的演说
    这些天来，我们这个委员会一直在讨论朝鲜问题。讨论集中在两个主要问题上。第一，会议的形式及会议所应依据的组织原则。第二，关于会议的组成。
    以美国为首的十五国提案的草拟者维护他们的提案及提案第五条甲项关于在交战国代表参加的基础上组织政治会议的规定。他们在讨论中特别强调需要严格遵守停战协定第六十款的规定。他们指出第六十款的条文是在处理这问题时所应遵循的唯一的——如他们所说——合法原则。
    不用说，第六十款是必须严格遵守的。这是一个很明白的要求，不但签订停战协定的国家应该遵守，所有一切的国家也应该遵守。而且不仅应遵守停战协定第六十款，还应该遵守整个协定。
    领头提出这一提案的美国代表竭力利用这第六十款的条文。他企图证明，十五国提案第五条甲项是像数学一样一点不差地符合于第六十款的条文的，而在关于组成政治会议的办法、方式和条件这些问题上采取任何其他立场，都将意味着违背了、或至少是蔑视了第六十款的条文。为了支持双方会议的立场，洛奇先生在八月十九日的演说中提到了南日大将的声明。据洛奇说，南日大将说，会议的一方面应代表北朝鲜和共产党中国的志愿军，另一方面则应该代表把军队置于联合国的统帅下的各国政府。
    洛奇先生从这个归在南日大将名下的声明中得出了两个结论：一、讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议必须包括两个方面。二、会议必须由双方指派的，并且是支持交战双方中的一方的国家的代表组成。
    这就是洛奇先生引用南日大将的声明所得出的两个结论，他就是这样来解释停战协定第四条第六十款的意义的。
    我要设法证明，至少要试着证明，洛奇先生得出的两个结论，不论是第一个还是第二个都不能由第六十款中推论出来。无论由上述条款的严格法律意义来说，或者退一步由它的严格政治意义来说，都不可能推断出这两个结论。
    我们一直认为，而且我仍然认为，并不能因为双方要指派它们的代表，就由第六十款得出会议必须由双方组成的结论。更不能由第六十款得出这样的结论说，签订停战协定并依据第六十款指派代表的双方，只能在十六个参战国中指派代表，把其余至少四十四个联合国会员国置于脑后；而美国及其盟国对朝鲜人民的三年多战争是在联合国的旗帜下进行的，是用联合国的名义进行的。从第六十款中怎么样也不能得出第一个结论，也不能得出第二个结论。
    至于他谈到的南日大将的声明，应该指出，新华通讯社曾经报道过，在联军司令部一九五二年十月十八日的正式报告（Ａ）二二二八号文件第十二页中也完全得到证实。南日大将在他一九五二年二月十九日的声明中，对“双方有关各国政府”一词的解释和朝中方面现在所了解的是一样的。
    南日大将说，他认为这个词句的意义是：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面的有关各国政府，和联合国军方面的有关各国政府。
    但是，这是和洛奇先生归在南日大将名下的话完全不同的。可是，我们现在一点也不在乎这一点，我们现在是在讨论会议组成问题。的确，事情应该是非常清楚的：如何了解“有关各国”一词的问题是一回事，谁应该代表这些国家出席会议的问题又是一回事。
    我们大家都很熟悉协定的第六十款。这一款的确说，政治会议的代表将由双方指派，但并不能因此就解释为这些代表一定只能是这两方的公民，如十五国提案的草拟者所认为的以及美国代表团所最顽固地主张的那样。
    美国代表团以及某些其他支持它的代表团的错误在于：它们用它们最武断的解释把第六十款的范围弄得很狭隘，这一款的条文是决不能容许作这种解释的。
    今天，澳大利亚代表斯宾德先生的话就非常清楚地表明了这个错误。他公然说，我们必须信守这一款的字句。对于他说来，这一款的意义和整个停战协定的意义都是不存在的。他所需要的是“字句”。并且他以为，信守“字句”就会作出合法的解释，而忘记了咬文嚼字和合法的解释完全是不同的事情。他忘记了，相反地，正确的合法解释是和仅仅拘泥于条文字句根本完全是两回事，因为合法的解释需要逻辑、政治和道义的判断，当然也需要对于总的内容、对于各条条文总的趋向的了解，或者如法律学家通常所说的，需要对于条文精神，或者更准确地说，对于这些条文的本质的了解。不然，就不能对个别的条文，也不能对整个协定作正确的解释。
    澳大利亚代表忽略了所有这些，而只提到第六十款的字句。可是，这样的一种解释在政治委员会差不多没有人给以支持。波兰代表团团长纳希科夫斯基说得对。他说，事实上，除了洛奇和他的某些追随者以外，没有人支持这种立场，也没有人为那种企图对停战协定第六十款作如此解释的难加支持的举动辩护，这种解释显然是有害于目前的事情的。好些通常支持美国立场的国家的代表，现在在这个问题上反对美国的立场。我们认为，他们是对的。
    我不能不提一下法国代表的发言。他说，对第六十款中的建议的措词“不要太咬文嚼字”。他又说，“一切能有效地参加谈判的方面都理应加以邀请。”
    因此，可能得到的唯一正确结论就是：——我必须重复舒曼先生的话——会议不要成为两个敌对阵营的会议，“相反的，这个会议要为共同讨论当前问题铺平道路”。据我看来，英国代表团采取了同样的态度。如劳埃德先生所说，他们认为在苏联代表团关于会议成员的提案中，他们看到了一定程度的共同基础。据我了解，这种共同基础便是，英国代表团也反对对第六十款作那种狭隘的解释，并且主张举行一个较广泛的政治会议，而不是只由那些曾派遣军队到朝鲜去的国家参加的政治会议。
    当然，我想顺便指出，劳埃德先生有些话是不对的。他说，苏联要想独断在朝鲜派有受克拉克将军指挥的军队的国家中究竟哪一些应该参加会议。这不是实在的，因为我们只是建议，而且这种建议的方式也决没有任何理由令人怀疑我们在独断独行。假使抱着这种态度的话，任何代表团提出的任何建议都可以被说成是独断独行了！
    埃及代表也谈到要让亚洲小国的代表尽可能广泛地参加这次会议。他说这将“有助于大国建立真诚的和平条件”。他希望会议参加国不要抱着为了在亚洲大陆各国保持殖民利益的目的来参加这次会议。
    我认为这是一种正确的说法，虽然在这方面我并不完全和埃及代表一样抱乐观的看法。
    许多代表都表示苏联和印度必须参加会议，并因而拒绝支持美国的双方会议的主张。
    那么，结果怎样呢？结果是：绝大多数代表都认为，美国和其他十五个代表团对第六十款的解释是错误的，他们在这问题上的整个立场也是错误的。只有美国和它的伙伴们才认为它们对第六十款的解释和它们的立场是对的。因此，无怪美国代表要把维护他们的立场的主要力量转移到会场之外了。他们希望由此达到他们的目的，正如我们的谚语所说那样：“不能挣来，就去偷来。”
    现在，再回头谈停战协定第六十款。必须指出，这一条款并没有对政治会议的组成问题作出明文规定。
    为了反对朝鲜的邻国参加政治会议，洛奇先生说：它们的参加可能把会议变成与联合国大会政治委员会相似的会议，包括了六十个国家的代表。洛奇先生的这种言论不但毫无根据，并且根本算不上是一种严肃的言论。因为我们的提案中很明白地说出，这一件事首先和并且最和朝鲜的邻国有关系，因此根本谈不到什么政治会议与包括六十国的政治委员会相类似的话。洛奇先生这样的一种言论当然是不能加以考虑的。
    然而对于规定一个“双方”的会议和“双方”指派代表出席会议的第六十款应作何解释呢？
    如果我们把十五国提案研究一下，特别是研究一下非常武断地把会议的成员只限于在战争中提供军队的国家和南朝鲜的第五条甲项，并且把它和第六十款比较一下，那么第五条甲项和第六十款的出入就显得很清楚了。事实上，第六十款没有提到那些把军队拨交联合国军司令部指挥的国家。第六十款并没有说，只有遣派军队参加朝鲜战争的这些国家才能参加会议。当然，如果没有这些参与战争的国家参加，就不能设想能举行一个会议来讨论和它们所进行的战争有关的问题和处理停战协定签订以后跟着而来的建立和平问题。然而，是不是这就等于说只有这些国家才能参加会议呢？我倒希望，那些只从字句不从意义来判断这件事的人从第六十款里给我找出这一点。他们是找不出来的，因为这一点根本是不存在的。
    显然与第六十款相矛盾的十五国提案，使一切不能列于交战国中的、没有派遣军队的国家；包括没有参加朝鲜战争的朝鲜邻国在内，没有可能参加会议；虽然谁都无法否认，这些国家（我指的是朝鲜邻国）非常关心朝鲜问题的和平解决，同样谁也无法否认，这些国家参加政治会议是非常重要的。
    苏联提案避免极端的办法。一方面我们认为，必须把会议的成员限于较小的数目内，以避免由于很多国家参加而产生的困难。
    另一方面我们认为，会议也必须包括——我着重指出这点——并且不仅包括那些没有参与战争的国家，特别是朝鲜的邻国。
    我应该说，当一个国家的和平解决问题正在争论中的时候，这个国家的邻国（我说的是一个和平的邻国）当然会比几千公里以外的国家更加关心这件事情——这是一个普遍的真理。
    鉴于目前的形势，我们怎么能竟然想到要把与朝鲜为邻的国家排除在处理和平解决朝鲜问题这样重要的问题的会议之外呢？可是，参加朝鲜战争的国家中有人坚持，只有他们才能参加政治会议，而朝鲜的邻国因为没有提供军队就必须被排除在会议之外。照这样说来，一方面是：任何参加武装干涉、参加屠杀朝鲜和平居民的政府都可以被允许参加政治会议，作为一种酬报。而另一方面：拿印度来说，并没有派军队到朝鲜去，也没有参加武装干涉，就不能在会议上有一席座位。这种不愿让印度参加政治会议的态度是用各种各样对第六十款的强词夺理的解释——心理上、法律上等等方面的解释——作为藉口的。
    我们认为，在政治方面和实际方面不但完全有正当的理由来容纳苏联参加会议（政治委员会上绝大多数代表都认为这是正确的），也有理由容纳像印度这样的国家（印度曾对爱好和平的国家结束朝鲜战争的努力作了巨大的贡献）以及波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、缅甸、印度尼西亚和其他好几个关心巩固和平的国家参加会议。这些国家在这些年来都化了不小的力量来结束而不是延长朝鲜战争。
    某些代表团，首先是在这次讨论中起重要作用的美国代表团，企图否认邀请印度和许多别的中立国家一道参加即将举行的关于朝鲜的会议是适当的。我们认为这种企图是毫无根据的。
    必须指出，美国参加政治委员会的代表当初并不反对印度参加。据报纸消息，到八月二十日，洛奇才表示反对印度参加。当时他在联合国外面宣布美国将投票反对印度参加关于朝鲜问题的政治会议。非常奇怪，就在洛奇发表这篇声明的时候，李承晚宣布：如果邀请印度来参加会议，南朝鲜就不来参加！正如美国报纸所公开宣布的，美国反对印度参加会议的主要理由就是李承晚上述的言论。此外，美国报纸甚至说，美国反对印度参加会议据说是因为这与停战协定第六十款相违背，这种解释是讲给广大人民群众听的。
    实际上，美国已和南朝鲜串通一气制订了一个关于会议成员的策略及总的行动计划。美国这种做法甚至于没有得到它在朝鲜战争中盟国的同意。当然，李承晚竟敢不顾自己的危险，扬言要抵制政治会议，那是难以令人相信的。不仅李承晚，而且那些在朝鲜战争中站在美国方面的任何一个国家都不敢这样做。
    洛奇否认美国和南朝鲜有秘密协议。但是，全部英国报纸正在叫嚷着这样的秘密协议。通常在西方外交的秘密事务上消息非常灵通的“每日先驱报”在报道李承晚和罗伯逊的协议时说，这种协议笼罩在令人不愉快的和危险的神秘气氛中，这并不是偶然的。毫无疑问，整个事情不是没有那种不仅是令人不愉快的而且也是危险的神秘性质的。在这一方面，应当指出，李承晚的所谓外务部长官卞荣泰最近自夸说，李承晚从和罗伯逊进行的谈判中得到的收获比他原先所希望的多百分之六十。实际上，他所得到的东西比他所要求的多一倍。如果我们记得杜勒斯的言论，特别是公开鼓励他们的南朝鲜宠儿的好战计划的那些言论，那末，美国国务院的这种有求必应的态度就很容易得到解释。
    这些事实不能轻易地放过。它们是够严重的，必须要郑重地来处理。它们引起了对于即将召开的会议的命运的某些恐惧。
    政治委员会不能忽视与讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议的前途有关的一切事情，也就是与这样的问题有关的一切事情，像政治气氛，政治局势，特别是那些几乎是在我们眼前拟出的破坏这个会议的计划的事实。这些事实引起了对于即将举行的政治会议的严重忧虑。
    甚至，向李承晚讨好的澳大利亚代表斯宾德先生在八月十八日的发言中也不得不承认，李承晚的好战态度使澳大利亚政府和人民、其他各国政府和人民大大地不安。虽然在承认这一点时，他带着保留的态度。而且我甚至愿意说，他还带着对敢于触及这一问题表示歉意的态度。每一个真正重视这个会议的命运的人，每一个认为政治会议是大大前进的一步（在解决一切迄未解决的问题方面的一个严重步骤）的人都在为它的前途焦急。
    言词、温和的愿望和忠言都是不够的。需要采取更有效的措施来消除新的挑衅行动的威胁，这些新的挑衅行动充满了重新引起战争的危险。在这些措施里面，首先是正确地组织政治会议，以保证坐在会议桌上——我们叫这会议是“圆桌会议”——的人，在开会时并不是居心要破坏会议，并不是居心要像两军阵前的军队那样行事，随时准备消灭对方，而是准备寻找一种共同的语言，准备通过协商在朝鲜、远东和全世界实现和平，准备消除朝鲜情势所曾预示的新的世界大战的威胁。
    这是一个很重要的问题，因此，我们不能漠视各种表明有人准备破坏会议的迹象。有些人士认为要保证顺利地和平解决朝鲜问题这样重要的问题，集合一切真正爱好和平的国家的力量来制止好战的冒险分子，保证一个符合于会议的和平任务的必需的政治气氛和政治形势，是绝对正确而必要的，我们完全赞同这些人士的意见。这是联合国主要的和根本的职责！
    然而某些代表企图用尽一切方法来使政治形势复杂化，认为这是他们在准备这次政治会议时的主要目标。
    这些代表发表骗人的声明，彰明昭著地曲解历史事实，要想使政治气氛紧张起来，并用诽谤和仇恨的毒素来破坏政治气氛。
    我们不能忽视有些代表的发言。他们在这里散布早已被驳倒的关于“来自北方的侵略”的骗人谎言，在散布这种谎言时态度还异常傲慢。
    这些代表们提供不出任何事实、任何证据来支持这种谎言，而且还拼命不顾我们早已在一九五零年提出来的证据以及以后几年的事实。这些证据和事实都揭露出谁是真正的侵略者。这些代表们一遍又一遍地重复关于来自北朝鲜的侵略的陈腔老调，而事实上北朝鲜本身倒是南朝鲜政府在外国干涉者的参与和指导之下发动的进攻的受害者。
    李承晚政权的保护者数年来顽固地拒绝了朝中方面提出的、并为苏联及其他爱好和平的国家所支持的、为了结束朝鲜战争、为了在朝鲜停火（作为促进和平事业的首要要求——在当时就是停战）的所有建议；他们顽固地拖延朝鲜的破坏性的战争，使生命遭到惨重的损失，给朝鲜人民带来不可估计的灾难，并使那些被干涉者赶到远东去为李承晚和他的保护者征服北朝鲜的青年们的国家蒙受严重的创伤。现在，他们倒假装着为他们自己所发动的战争的牺牲者感到悲伤！同时，他们又企图把事情说得好像是他们真正的意图是以和平方式统一朝鲜。他们只不过忘了一件事，就是，有无数证据揭露了他们的与此完全相反的意图和计划，不仅揭露了他们的计划，而且还揭露他们实际上已经采取的和正在采取的行动。
    他们口头上所说的朝鲜的“统一”，只不过是摧毁朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并把南朝鲜卖国的反动政权扩大到北朝鲜的罪恶计划的骗人伪装而已。他们企图以“统一”朝鲜的口号来掩盖这些罪恶的计划，但是，实际上，问题的实质是完全两样的！问题的实质是要恢复对北朝鲜的战争，以便消灭北朝鲜的民主制度，并使北朝鲜屈从于现在的南朝鲜政府。
    我不得不提醒你们注意这些事实，因为某些代表作了关于侵略问题的声明，这些声明是不能不加以愤慨的回击的。我必须声明在先，我是宁愿谈关于双方采取使政治会议组织得有成效、能够产生积极的结果的措施的，而是不愿谈这点的。然而，一个人无法漠视这一点。不过，既然我们在这里受到了各方面的攻击，我必须提醒你们一下，并且为了求简短的缘故，只引证某些事实，下面就是：
    第一个事实。一九四九年联合国委员会报告书的附件中指出，南朝鲜政府除了——如联合国报告书所说的——它自己的建议外，反对任何统一朝鲜的建议。从联合国同一个委员会的材料中可以看到南朝鲜的建议是什么。归根结蒂地说起来，这些建议就是用暴力征服北朝鲜，并且把北朝鲜并入南朝鲜。
    委员会指出——我是在引证这个文件——“总统
    （李承晚）、外务部长官和其他重要的、有势力的政治家常常发表声明说，光阴在不断地流去，在无法可想的时候，用武力来求得统一可能是不得不采取的最后解决问题的手段。”
    这是早在一九四九年说的话，并且这是联合国委员会所承认的。
    这个事实难道不就是说明有一个要征服北朝鲜的计划存在吗？这个“总统”和所谓“南朝鲜政府”的所谓“长官们”早在一九四九年的时候所追求的难道不就是对北朝鲜进行战争吗？
    第二个事实。李承晚分子不愿意和北朝鲜人谈判和平统一朝鲜的问题。例如，在联合国大会承认所谓大韩民国（即南朝鲜）政府的第一周年时，当时的大韩民国外务部长官“希望居民尽一切努力……在明年十二月十二日以前实现全朝鲜的统一”。他并且说，“人民坚决要这样做，并准备流血”。李承晚也曾说过：“当不可避免的时机到来时，我们恐怕就很难避免流血和内战。如果我们万一在今年内不能实现统一，我们就不得不用自己的努力求得自己祖国的统一。”同时他也说过：“我们不得不流血，我们不能避免内战……”这就可以看出内战到底是谁挑拨起来的！所谓南朝鲜政府一面对拥护建立独立、民主、统一的朝鲜的主张的南朝鲜进步民主人士进行恐怖屠杀，一面如联合国委员会的文件所指出的，准备进攻北朝鲜。这从李承晚在一九四九年的信中也可以看出。
    第三个事实。李承晚在一封信中写道：“我现在想把我们目前的情况简略地告诉你，我坚定地相信：现在是采取进攻性的步骤，并团结北朝鲜共军中效忠于我们的那一部分人以便将其余的一部分歼灭的心理上最有利的时机。”他在这封信中写道：“我们将要把金日成手下的一部分人赶到山里去，让他们在那儿饿死。然后我们的国防线将推展到图们江和鸭绿江。我们的地位也将比现在好上百倍。”这就是这位先生所谈过的话。他准备饿死那些为保卫自己年青的民主主义人民共和国而奋斗的北朝鲜居民。他想把北朝鲜人赶进山区去挨饿。这就是李承晚在一九四九年所写的话。后来怎样呢？到了一九五○年，李承晚一帮人靠着他们的美国保护人的支持，开始实现这一骇人听闻的计划了。
    第四个事实。我们举出赵炳玉给李承晚的信。赵炳玉是南朝鲜驻美大使，李承晚的心腹及李承晚在这里的代理人的最亲近的帮手。他写道：“我深信，朝鲜的统一只有以行使我国政府的主权才能达到。”这句话是什么意思？如果不诉诸武力的话，李承晚这帮人怎样能利用他那“主权”把北朝鲜统一到自己的版图下呢？赵炳玉表示：“任何妥协或谈判的政策都不行。冷战不能永久持续下去。没有第三次世界大战，所有这些世界问题都不能获得解决。我们的统一计划必须适应整个国际形势的发展。政府当前最为重要的任务就是加强我们在军事和经济方面的准备。”
    第五个事实。今年七月二十九日李承晚说：“要是共产党拒绝同意统一朝鲜，那美国不恢复朝鲜战争，倒是不可思议的事了。”这种叫嚷对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的挑衅性质难道不是十分明显的吗？特别大家都知道，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府向来就主张通过和平的途径统一朝鲜，争取建立统一、民主与独立的朝鲜。因此这种叫嚷的挑衅性质难道不是很明显的吗？
    第六个事实。昨天，李承晚的代表在这里说：“据说，停战协定不应当受时间限制。大韩民国的任何行动如果破坏了停战协定所规定的南北分裂，就会被斥责为破坏停战条款。而且，这种行动，会和侵略行动一样地被严厉看待。”十分清楚，只有那些准备以消除国家的分裂为藉口来破坏停战协定的人们才会这样说。据他说，他预见到这种可能性而表示遗憾，就是：“大韩民国如果企图不靠外人的援助单独来干联合国和大韩民国曾经企图共同完成的事业，那就可能被抛弃和受批评。”换一句话说，所谓南朝鲜政府害怕，如果它想单独来干它在战争中曾企图和联合国一同干的事，它会受到抛弃。昨天李承晚的发言人表示，要是在政治会议上事情不按照着显然为美国反动集团所同意的李承晚的道路来进行，那么，南朝鲜“政府”还要继续筹划恢复战争的计划。
    这一类事实是很多的。我只谈了这一些。然而就是这些事实已足以说明强加于朝鲜人民身上的战争的真实情况是如何的了。
    现在谈谈和政治会议直接有关的问题罢。几天以前，我在政治委员会上的发言中已经指出，联合国有绝对的无可争辩的权利来对有关维持和巩固和平与国际安全的任何问题提出建议。毫无疑问，讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议的成员问题也包括在这些问题之内。因为政治会议不仅对和平解决朝鲜问题有重大意义，而且对维持和巩固和平与国际安全的整个事业也有重大的意义。就这样的问题提出建议，不只是联合国大会的权利，而且也是它的义务。联合国宪章第十一条特别是其中第二款授权大会做这项工作，该款说必须讨论“关于维持国际和平及安全之任何问题”和就任何这种问题提出建议。
    由此，我想谈谈另外一个问题。大家知道，武装干涉者硬说武装干涉是联合国反对“北朝鲜的侵略”的集体行动。大家知道，这个武装干涉的十六个参与国的司令部打着联合国的旗帜，利用联合国的名义。一九五○年六月开始的反对朝鲜人民的军事行动，被说成“联合国”进行的军事行动。无论在什么场合都抬出“联合国”这个字眼。可是，临到发生哪些联合国会员国有权参加关于朝鲜问题的政治会议的问题时，那些不是在美国领导下参加朝鲜战争的国家就被反对参加了。一些在朝鲜作战的国家就是这样地企图垄断参加关于和平解决朝鲜问题的会议的权利，否认联合国其他会员国有权参加这一会议。毫无疑问，那些比参加上述集团的许多国家更要关心解决朝鲜问题的会员国却被拒绝参加会议。不难证明，这种情况是没有道理的，是与联合国的国际威信和尊严不相容的。不用特别说明，大家也知道，这种情况与联合国会员国权利平等的基本原则、与民主的基本含义是何等的不相容。因为一些代表团强迫绝大多数的联合国会员国接受他们的意志，也就是接受美国反动集团的意志。他们毫不理睬别人的意见，毫不尊重联合国其他会员国的尊严。澳大利亚代表在今天的发言中想证明，推荐政治会议的成员不是联合国的事，为此他引用了南日大将的话。据他说，南日大将在板门店谈判时曾说：“在谈判时用联合国这个字是没有根据的。”南日接着说：“这所以不正确，是因为对朝鲜人民作战的国家并不能真正地代表联合国，而实际上有许多联合国会员国并没有参加朝鲜战争。”但这段引语一点也没有说明斯宾德先生所要说明的论点。
    南日指出，在朝鲜作战的十六个国家的集团其实并不是联合国组织，因为还有四十四个国家并没有在朝鲜作战。这种说法是完全正确的。虽然其中有些国家赞成这个战争、甚至投票赞成了宣布北朝鲜为侵略者的相应决议，但这种情形是不能说明任何问题的，因为其中有许多国家是明显地被迫走上这条悲惨的道路的。澳大利亚代表认为，联合国组织不能推荐自己的代表参加政治会议——如他在今天的发言中所说的——而可以建议他们作为这个会议的这一方或那一方的成员。但是，这是完全不正确的。联合国组织应当看到自己的任务不在于补充在停战协定上签字的、曾经参加战争的这一方或那一方的代表，而在于推荐会议本身的成员，不管这些被推荐的国家将属于这一方或那一方。政治会议应当根据“圆桌”会议的形式来组织。大会和整个联合国组织应当而且能够推荐组成会议本身的成员，而不是向会议推荐补充交战的这一方或那一方的代表。因此根据同情交战的这一方或那一方的原则来挑选会议的成员是不行的。如果走上了这条道路，那末，联合国组织就决不可能保证会议能得到能够在政治上和实际上真正正确地解决摆在会议面前的问题的成员。既然联合国大会自称是一个国际组织，是一个和平的组织，而不是战争的组织，它要推荐这样一个会议的参加者时，就不能从谁是它的朋友、谁不是它的朋友这样一种观点出发，来选择这一会议的参加者。劳埃德先生在这里说过：“我们不能不邀请自己的朋友们参加这次会议。”如果照这一个原则来组织会议，想庇护自己的众亲好友，那末随便什么国际会议都是开不成的。这样会议不会得到任何结果的。
    因此，有必要重提一下，美国总统艾森豪威尔于今年四月十六日在他的演说中表示，准备把联合国变成能有效地保卫和平和各国人民的安全的机构。大家知道，正如联合国宪章的序言中所叙明的，建立联合国的主要宗旨是加强和平和国际安全。但为了使联合国在加强和平和国际安全的事业上称职，它的全体会员国必须遵守宪章的原则，不应该有一个政府企图把联合国变成自己外交政策的辅助机构。现在如果看一下美国的提案——以美国代表团为首的十五国代表团的提案，就应当说，这一提案正是为了要把联合国当作美国外交政策的辅助机构的那种企图的新的例子。“十五国提案”就是以美国为首的十五国代表团向整个联合国发出的特别命令。以美国为首的集团对政治会议的成员所持的立场就证明它们忽视了这一简单的事实，即：会议的成功与否是取决于那些十分关心和平解决朝鲜问题的国家是否参加会议。这是必须了解的，而且必须按照这一完全无可争辩的原则去行动的。
    最后我认为必须谈谈别人对苏联提案的批评，特别是对我们提案的最后一句话的批评。对我们提案的这一点谈得特别仔细的是劳埃德先生。我首先要指出的是，劳埃德同意，这个会议不应当用计算票数的办法解决问题，不应当有表决程序，或者如他所明白表示的，表决的因素是可以排除的。我认为说得正确些，表决的因素是应该排除的。劳埃德又说，政治会议将没有表决程序，表决因素可以排除这一点，是“我们中间”的共同想法，即显然是提出十五国提案的一切国家中间的共同想法。但是劳埃德不同意要签订协定的双方同意的决定才能作为通过，如我们的提案所指出的那样。换句话说，劳埃德坚持那种会议可以没有签订停战协定双方的同意就通过决定的立场。劳埃德先生在论述这一问题时说，他认为，对于我们提案的上述一点可能有几种不同的理解。据劳埃德的意见，这几种不同的理解归结起来如下：南朝鲜被排除于享受我们提案所保证的权利（劳埃德称为“否决权”）的国家之外。应该说明的是，对我们的提案所作的这“各种理解”没有一个是有任何根据的，因为我们并不认为，南朝鲜可以排除于这个会议之外，如劳埃德先生把我们的提案作了不正确的解释而认为的那样。苏联代表团提出关于政治会议的建议绝对不是根据某种暂时性的原则，而是从自己的外交政策的严肃的基本原则出发的。其中用来处理这个问题的一个原则是：必须从这样一点出发（而苏联现在正是从这一点出发），即北朝鲜和南朝鲜作为主要成员参加政治会议是必然的，这是不言而喻的。我们不否认南朝鲜作为这样一个与会者的权利；这些与会者的同意是通过会议决议所必需的。我们所主张的会议的决议只有得到了签订停战协定双方的一致同意才能作为通过这一原则，意味着会议的任何决议，必须获得签订停战协定双方一致的赞同，才能作为通过。因此，如果把我们对关于朝鲜问题的政治会议的立场解释成为会议可以不得到南朝鲜的同意就通过决议，这是不正确的。因为这无论在政治上、在实际上都是没有任何意义的。苏联对朝鲜问题的原则性的立场决定于这一原则：朝鲜人，即北朝鲜和南朝鲜的代表，应当解决自己内部的事情。由昨天中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来先生的声明可以看出，他也是采取这样的立场的。中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来先生的声明十分公正地指出了几个非常重要的原则。因为今天纽约的报纸对周恩来的声明讲得不准确，我认为有必要根据新华社所广播的这个声明的原文，重复一下这个声明的主要原则。中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来先生说，一、“为了使政治会议能够和谐进行，以便在国际事务中给和平协商解决争端建立典范，政治会议应采取圆桌会议的形式，即朝鲜停战双方在其他有关国家参加之下共同协商的形式，而不采取朝鲜停战双方单独谈判的形式。但会议的任何决议，必须得到朝鲜停战双方的一致同意，才能成立。”二、周恩来先生继续说：“政治会议的职权范围，应根据朝鲜停战协定第六十款的规定，先行协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，包括联合国军及中国人民志愿军在内，及和平解决朝鲜问题，然后再讨论其他问题。”三、周恩来说，中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为，苏联代表团在联合国大会政治委员会上所提的关于政治会议的成员的提案是符合于上述原则的，它表示支持。周恩来先生又说：“中央人民政府并认为，凡以军队参加联合国军在朝鲜进行战争的国家，可被考虑作为停战的一方参加会议。”四、周恩来特别讲到拒绝邀请中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加关于政治会议问题的讨论，他说，联合国是不合理的。周恩来说：“因此，为了促成政治会议的顺利召开，联合国大会有责任将一切有关政治会议问题的各项提案和建议随时通知中朝两国政府。”周恩来最后说：“联合国大会的任何建议，如果符合于本声明中前述的各项原则，中央人民政府将予考虑作为举行政治会议的基础。”我们完全同意周恩来先生声明中的四项原则。
    根据苏联对政治会议问题所采取的原则性的态度，并考虑到一些代表团在政治委员会对苏联提案的意见，苏联代表团向政治委员会提出关于政治会议的成员的提案如下：
    “大会鉴于有必要保证政治会议在最有利的情况下顺利进行其工作，建议召开讨论朝鲜问题的政治会议，由下列成员组成：美国、英国、法国、苏联、中华人民共和国、印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、南朝鲜、印度尼西亚、叙利亚、埃及、墨西哥和缅甸。必须说明，会议的决议只有得到了签订停战协定双方的一致同意，才能作为通过。”
    这就是苏联对政治会议问题所采取的态度，这种态度是完全符合民主原则和双方平等原则的，也完全符合朝鲜停战协定第四条第六十款的原则的。（新华社据塔斯社纽约二十八日电）
