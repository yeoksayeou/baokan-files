Hu Yaobang, Head of the Chinese Youth Delegation, said in his speech that we are deeply moved by the friendship of the Romanian youth towards the Chinese youth. He congratulated the Romanian youth on their greater achievements in the cause of building socialism. Liu Daosheng, Deputy Head of the Chinese Youth Delegation, presented Romanian youth with an embroidery of Romanian people's leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and several woven portraits, representing the Chinese youth's respect for the Romanian people's leader.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The China Youth Photo Exhibition, which opened in Bucharest on the 5th of this month, has been warmly welcomed. By the 13th, the number of visitors had reached more than 31,000.

The layout of the exhibition is solemn and simple. A giant portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong hangs at the entrance of the exhibition. Below the large banner "Chinese Youth Marching Towards Peace and a Bright Future" are four pictures of Chinese young men and women moving forward hand in hand. The exhibited pictures are divided into two parts. The first part introduces how Chinese youth, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, actively participate in the construction of the motherland. The second part introduces the happy lives enjoyed by Chinese youth under the care of the Party and the government. In addition to the pictures, the exhibition also displays models of coal mines, steel plants, ships, and coal mining machines.

Jacques Denis, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, wrote in the guestbook: "I pay tribute to the Chinese youth because this exhibition shows the great achievements made by the Chinese youth working hard together with the Chinese people." An Italian youth representative from Milan wrote:
"This exhibition tells us that the Chinese people and youth are unswervingly advancing towards a socialist future, and no imperialist force can stop People's China from striving for peace and the happiness of mankind."
