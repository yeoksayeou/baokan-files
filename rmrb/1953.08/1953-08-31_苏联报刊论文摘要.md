    Striving to Further Develop the Invention and Rationalization Proposal Movement
    "Labor News" published an editorial on August 22, pointing out the great significance of consistently and systematically carrying out the invention and rationalization proposal movement. The summary is as follows: The Communist Party and the Soviet government have always considered the creativity of production innovators to be of great significance. The 19th National Congress of the Party re-emphasized the need to more vigorously carry out the invention and rationalization proposal movement among engineers, technicians, workers, and collective farmers.
    Many of our industrial enterprises attach great importance to inventions and rationalization proposals. Economic organizations and trade union organizations warmly support the innovators, giving them assistance in all aspects. For example, the inventors and rationalization proposers of the Andreyev Metallurgical Factory in Taganrog City are successfully carrying out their creative activities. The number of inventors and rationalization proposers in the factory exceeds 600. Last year, the factory adopted 708 suggestions in production, saving the state more than three million rubles.
    The factory vigorously helps rationalization proposers and inventors among the workers. The experimental workshop in the factory serves them. In the technical research room attached to the club, there are experienced engineers on duty every day who consult with inventors, help them draft blueprints, sketches, and make calculations. The factory trade union committee and the factory administration often jointly hold factory-wide representative meetings to discuss issues related to further developing rationalization proposals and inventions.
    However, it cannot be said that the work of organizing inventors and rationalization proposers has been arranged well in all enterprises. In some places, this patriotic movement has fallen into a state of laissez-faire: production innovators do not receive assistance, and their suggestions are not adopted in a timely manner.
    The reason why the organizational work of rationalization proposers and inventors is lax is that some economic leaders treat all new and progressive things with a conservative attitude, while trade union organizations are indifferent to the fate of rationalization proposers' suggestions.
    The leaders of many enterprises do not carry out the organizational work for rationalization proposers and inventors consistently and systematically, but intermittently. In this way, it is impossible to truly improve the invention and rationalization proposal movement.
    The trade union committees of factories and workshops should greatly strengthen their activities to mobilize workers' inventions and rationalization proposals. They are responsible for supervising the timely implementation of accepted suggestions, fully assisting rationalization proposers, and fighting against conservatism and bureaucracy in the process of reviewing and implementing innovators' suggestions.

    Further Improve the Level of Local Broadcasting
    "Soviet Culture News" published an editorial on August 18 entitled "Further Improve the Level of Local Broadcasting." The summary is as follows: In our country, broadcasting is a paperless newspaper that is not limited by distance. The Soviet people cannot live a minute without broadcasting.
    Local broadcasting, like central broadcasting, has great significance in the lives of the people.
    Local broadcasting faces an important task. This is to deeply and comprehensively publicize the resolutions of the 19th National Congress of the Party, the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the decisions of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and mobilize the working people to actively participate in the struggle to complete the urgent tasks in industry, transportation, and agriculture put forward by the Party and the government, and to realize measures to further improve the material well-being of the people.
    The duty of local broadcasting staff is to fully meet the growing demands of the audience, to use specific examples that are often encountered and easy to understand in life to deeply and clearly show the rich political, economic, and cultural life of the Soviet people, to politically educate the residents, explain the policies of the Party and the government, and to demonstrate the constant care of the Party and the government for improving the material and cultural welfare of the Soviet people. Soviet radio stations are promoters of advanced experience. It should actively promote the development of mass creative initiatives, promptly point out and publicize all new and advanced things, and support and promote the experience of innovators in industry and agriculture. Radio stations should help working people overcome difficulties in their work, eliminate shortcomings in their work, and successfully complete the tasks of the country.
    Unfortunately, the work of many local radio stations is still unsatisfactory, their broadcasting level is low, and it is not connected with the tasks put forward by the Party and the government.
    The broadcasting work of the broadcasting departments of Khabarovsk, Novosibirsk and other states is unsatisfactory. The language of broadcasting is dry and lacks emotion. Articles and talks on socio-political topics are often filled with outdated materials, minor facts, and large numbers of figures and percentages, which seem like reports and instructions from the authorities.
    Soviet broadcasting has a deep popular nature. It serves the people, is connected with the people, and relies on the constant support of the people. Listeners cannot tolerate gray broadcasts. They hope that the radio station can explain the spiritual and moral appearance of the Soviet people and their patriotic cause in an attractive, understandable, and clear way.
    The level of many broadcasts is low because local broadcasting workers do not know enough about life, have not established contact with collective farms, state farms, machine tractor stations, enterprises, and scientific institutions, and do not rely on a large number of active contributors. It is impossible to deeply and comprehensively reflect the diversity of life with the strength of a few fixed-quota personnel.
    Without the participation of active contributors, broadcasting will inevitably be boring.
    Literary and artistic programs—music, drama, and children's programs—occupy an important position in the broadcasting of the union republics and autonomous republics. Music broadcasting is one of the most important tools for publicizing musical works, conducting ideological and artistic education for the working people, and organizing their cultural entertainment. However, the broad possibilities of music broadcasting have not been fully used.
    Literary and artistic works have not been fully used in the communist education of the audience. Local broadcasting personnel do not often seriously select literary works for broadcasting, and often publicize works that are not satisfactory in terms of ideology and art. Broadcasting for children is still at a low artistic and educational level.
    An indispensable condition for improving the quality of local broadcasting is to correctly select and allocate cadres. It is regrettable that in many local broadcasting organs, due attention has not been paid to the selection and education of cadres.

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    争取进一步开展发明和合理化建议运动
    “劳动报”八月二十二日发表社论，指出一贯地、有计划地开展发明和合理化建议运动的重大意义。摘要如下：共产党和苏联政府过去和现在一直认为生产革新者的创造具有重大的意义。党的第十九次代表大会重新强调了在工程师、技术人员、工人和集体农民中间更有力地开展发明和合理化建议运动的必要性。
    我们有许多工业企业很重视发明和合理化建议。经济组织和工会组织热烈地支持着革新者们，给他们以各方面的帮助。例如，塔干洛格市安德烈耶夫冶金工厂的发明者和合理化建议者们很顺利地展开着自己的创造性活动。该厂的发明者和合理化建议者的人数超出六百，去年厂方在生产中采用了七百零八件建议，为国家节约的卢布达三百万以上。
    该厂大力帮助着工人中的合理化建议者和发明者。厂中的实验工作室为他们服务。在俱乐部附设的技术研究室中，每天都有值日的有经验的工程师，他同发明者们磋商，帮助他们草拟蓝图、草图和作计算。工厂工会委员会和工厂行政当局常常共同举行全厂代表会议，讨论有关进一步开展合理化建议和发明的问题。
    但，并不能说在所有的企业中都已把组织发明者和合理化建议者的工作安排得很好。在某些地方，这一爱国主义运动陷于自流状态：生产革新者得不到帮助，他们的建议没有被及时采用。
    合理化建议者和发明者的组织工作所以松懈，是因为某些经济领导者以守旧态度对待一切新的和进步的事物，而工会组织方面又对合理化建议者建议的命运漠不关心。
    许多企业的领导者不是一贯地、有计划地，而是时作时辍地进行对合理化建议者和发明者的组织工作，这样，也就不能真正改进发明和合理化建议运动。
    应当大大加强工厂和车间的工会委员会对发动工人的发明和合理化建议的活动。它们负有责任来监督及时实现已接纳的建议，全力帮助合理化建议者，向所有表现于革新者建议的审查和实施过程中的守旧心理和官僚主义进行斗争。
    再提高地方广播水平
    “苏维埃文化报”八月十八日发表以“再提高地方广播水平”为题的社论。摘要如下：在我国，广播就是不受距离限制的无纸的报纸。苏联人民的生活一分钟也少不了广播。
    地方广播和中央广播一样，在人民的生活中具有重大的意义。
    地方广播面对着一个重要的任务。这就是深刻而全面地宣传党的第十九次代表大会的决议、第五个五年计划、苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议的决定，并动员劳动人民积极参加争取完成党和政府所提出的工业、运输、农业各方面的迫切任务和实现进一步改善人民物质幸福的措施的斗争。
    地方广播工作人员的职责，是要全面满足听众的日益增长着的要求，要用生活中间经常遇到容易理解的具体例子，深刻而明确地表明苏联人民的丰富的政治、经济和文化的生活，要从政治上教育居民，解释党和政府的政策，并要表现出党和政府对改善苏联人民物质文化福利的经常的关怀。苏联的广播电台是先进经验的宣扬者。它应积极推动群众的创造性倡议的发展，及时指出并宣传一切新的、先进的事物，支持和推广工业和农业革新者的经验。广播电台应帮助劳动人民克服工作中的困难，消灭工作中的缺点，并顺利完成国家的任务。
    可惜，许多地方广播电台的工作仍然不能令人满意，它们的广播工作水平很低，而且和党与政府所提出的任务毫无联系。
    哈巴罗夫斯克、诺沃西比尔斯克及其他州的广播部的广播工作就使人感到不能满意。广播的语言枯燥而缺乏感情。以社会政治为题的论文和谈话中间往往充塞着陈旧的材料、次要的事实和大量的数字、百分比，看来好像机关的报告和指令。
    苏联的广播具有深刻的人民性，它为人民服务，与人民联系在一起，它是依靠着人民的经常支持的。听众不能容忍灰色的广播。他们希望广播电台能引人入胜而又容易了解地、明确地说明苏联人民精神上和道义上的外貌和他们的爱国主义的事业。
    许多广播的水平所以低，因为地方广播工作者对生活的了解不够，没有和集体农庄、国营农场、机器拖拉机站、企业和科学机关建立起联系，没有依靠广大的撰稿的积极分子。几个定额的工作人员的力量是不可能深刻地、全面地来反映生活的多样性的。
    没有撰稿的积极分子来参加，广播工作必然就枯燥无味。
    文艺节目——音乐、戏剧和儿童节目等——在加盟共和国和自治共和国的广播中占有重要地位。音乐广播是宣传音乐作品、对劳动人民进行思想艺术教育和组织他们的文化娱乐的最重要工具之一。但是音乐广播的广阔的可能性是没有被充分使用。
    在对听众的共产主义教育上，文艺作品没有受到充分的使用。地方广播人员没有经常以严肃的态度选择用于广播的文学作品，时常宣传一些在思想和艺术方面不能令人满意的作品。对于儿童的广播仍处于一种低的艺术和教育水平。
    改善地方广播的质量的不可缺少的条件就是正确地选拔和配置干部。在许多地方广播机关里，对于干部的选拔和教育工作没有给予应有的注意，这是引为遗憾的。
