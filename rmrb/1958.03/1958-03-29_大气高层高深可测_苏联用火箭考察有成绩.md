Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an article stating that the geophysical rocket launched by the Soviet Union on February 21st of this year, both in terms of the altitude it reached and the breadth of the scientific explorations it conducted, far surpassed previous experiments conducted by the Soviet Union and other countries to explore the upper atmosphere using rockets.

This single-stage rocket conducted new measurements of electron density in the upper atmosphere below 470 kilometers, measuring the electron density at 470 kilometers to be approximately one million electrons per cubic centimeter. Soviet experiments have proven that the electron density above the upper limit of the F layer decreases extremely slowly. Some speculate that this is because charged particles are strongly diffused from the denser lower layers of the ionosphere.

The "Pravda" article introduced many important achievements made by the Soviet Union in conducting scientific investigations of phenomena occurring in the upper atmosphere and the near-Earth part of cosmic space using rockets.

The Soviet Union's scientific exploration program using rockets during the International Geophysical Year included: measuring temperature, pressure, and chemical composition at different altitudes in the atmosphere; studying the properties of the ionosphere; investigating cosmic rays; studying the short-wave ultraviolet spectrum of the sun; and studying micrometeorites.

In order to study meteorites coming into the atmosphere from interstellar space, barium titanate was used as a pressure transmitter in the February 21, 1958, experiment. The movement of micrometeorites at altitudes up to 300 kilometers was recently recorded. These materials are of great significance for ensuring the safe operation of rockets and artificial Earth satellites in interstellar space.

By using rockets to send scientific instruments directly into the ionosphere, it is possible to measure the characteristics of the ionosphere using new methods in areas inaccessible to ground-based observations.

Measurements taken in the upper atmosphere below 200 to 250 kilometers have greatly changed our view of the structure of the ionosphere in this region.

"Pravda" reported that the Soviet Union has conducted large-scale biological studies in flights in the upper atmosphere since 1949. These experiments have shown that animals' health is not adversely affected during ejection, parachuting, and flight in the upper atmosphere. The flight safety devices worked extremely effectively, thus ensuring the animals' smooth landing.

"Pravda" finally talked about the issue of flying to the moon. The newspaper pointed out that with the further development of rocket technology, the task of reaching the moon and conducting major scientific explorations related to it can be achieved in the coming years.

"Pravda" pointed out that only by building heavy artificial satellites can the problem of interstellar travel be solved relatively quickly; it is impossible to solve this problem by using tiny satellites in any way.

### 大气高层高深可测  苏联用火箭考察有成绩

    大气高层高深可测
    苏联用火箭考察有成绩
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”发表文章说，苏联在今年2月21日发射的地球物理火箭，无论就它达到的高度，或者就它所进行的科学考察范围之广说来，都远远超过以前苏联和其他国家所进行的用火箭考察大气高层的实验。
    这个一级火箭对四百七十公里以下高空电子浓度进行了新的测量，测出四百七十公里高空电子浓度约为每立方公分一百万个电子。苏联试验证明，F层上限以上电子浓度减少得极为缓慢。有人推测，这是因为带电粒子从电离层密度较大的下层强烈地扩散开来。
    “真理报”这篇文章介绍了苏联在用火箭对大气高层和接近地球的部分宇宙空间中所发生的现象进行科学考察方面取得的许多重要成就。
    苏联在国际地球物理年期间用火箭进行的科学考察计划中包括：测定大气层不同高度上的温度、压力和化学成份，研究电离层的性质，考察宇宙线，研究太阳短波紫外线光谱段，研究微陨星。
    为了研究从星际空间来到大气层的陨星，1958年2月21日的试验中使用了钛酸钡作为压力发送器。不久前记录到了高达三百公里的高空的微陨星的运动。这些材料对保证火箭和人造地球卫星在星际空间安全运行有巨大的意义。
    利用把科学仪器直接送上电离层的火箭，可以在地面考察无法达到的地区用新的方法测量电离层的特性。
    在二百到二百五十公里以下的高空进行的测量，使我们对这一区域电离层结构的看法有了很大改变。
    “真理报”报道，苏联从1949年起就在大气高层的飞行中进行了大规模生物学考察。这些试验表明，在大气高层弹射、跳伞和飞行时，动物健康没有受到任何有害影响。飞行保安装置工作得极为有效，因而保障了动物的顺利着陆。
    “真理报”最后谈到飞向月球的问题。报纸指出，随着火箭技术的进一步发展，到达月球的任务和进行与此有联系的重大科学考察工作，在最近几年内就可以实现。
      “真理报”指出，只有建造重量大的人造卫星，才能比较快地解决星际旅行问题，利用微小的卫星无论如何也不可能解决这个问题。
