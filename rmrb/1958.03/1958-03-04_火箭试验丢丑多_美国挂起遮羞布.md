Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd, Washington dispatch: Fearing the embarrassment of rocket test failures in the face of world opinion, the U.S. government announced on March 1st restrictions on news and photographic reporting about rocket launch tests conducted at Cape Canaveral.

The restrictions, announced by Murray Snyder, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, stipulate that reporters "will not be allowed to enter the test site to cover launches that would reveal secret intelligence," and that tests conducted on "equipment about which no information has previously been disclosed" will also "not be notified in advance."

The regulations also stipulate that "technical information about launch preparations" will only be provided "on a not-for-publication basis," and this information may only be published after the missile has been launched or after a postponement of the launch has been announced.

    火箭试验丢丑多
    美国挂起遮羞布
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：由于害怕火箭试验失败在世界舆论面前丢丑，美国政府在3月1日宣布限制关于在卡纳维拉尔角进行火箭发射试验的新闻报道和摄影报道。
    这项由美国公共事务助理国防部长墨莱·斯奈德公布的限制条例规定，记者们“将不得进入试验场去采访会泄露秘密情报的发射”，并且对“以前未曾透露过任何情报的装备”进行的试验，也“不愿先通知”。
    条例还规定，“有关发射的准备工作的技术情报”只是在“暂不发表的基础上”提供，这种情报只有在导弹已经发射出去或在宣布延期发射以后，才允许发表。
