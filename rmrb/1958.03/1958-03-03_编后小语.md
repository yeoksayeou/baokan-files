    Editor's Note
    While compiling this supplement, we are thinking of the readers' suggestions.
    Readers have sent many enthusiastic letters to the editorial department, expressing their welcome to the Spring Festival songs of writers and poets, and expressing their gratitude to the writers and poets.
    However, new suggestions have also been put forward: hoping that writers and poets will sing "Songs of the Great Leap Forward" again, to reflect the scenes of the Great Leap Forward more vividly and concretely, and to show the Great Leap Forward of people.
    This is the voice of the people making the Great Leap Forward, and we respectfully convey this voice to the writers and poets, to the composers and painters, and expect everyone will "repay them in kind".
    Therefore, we are changing "Spring Festival Songs" to "Songs of the Great Leap Forward" from today onwards.
    However, the Great Leap Forward is the Great Leap Forward of 600 million people, and it is the Great Leap Forward in all aspects of life. Relying solely on writers and poets, even if they contribute all their energy, I am afraid they can only reflect a fraction of this Great Leap Forward. Therefore, people from all walks of life and all kinds need to take action to make "Songs of the Great Leap Forward" a true great chorus of the people. We want to reflect all kinds of singing in "Songs of the Great Leap Forward." The singing of the working people is very outstanding, "the best poems" is proof.
    Ten fingers are never all the same length. There are always backward phenomena in our lives. Even if this problem only occurs on one finger, we must correct it immediately. Tolerating the existence of backward phenomena is incompatible with our aspirations. Therefore, we still need sharper criticism. The people have already promoted this fiery criticism in life, and we want to reflect it in the supplement; the supplement needs more essays. We hope everyone will take action.

    编后小语
    编着这一期副刊，想着读者的倡议。
    读者把许多热情的信送到编辑部，对作家和诗人们的迎春曲表示欢迎，向作家和诗人表示感谢。
    然而也提出了新的倡议：希望作家和诗人们再唱“跃进之歌”，更生动、具体地反映跃进的景象。显示人的跃进。
    这是跃进着的人们发出的呼声，我们谨把这呼声转达给作家和诗人，转达给作曲家和画家，意料大家必定会“有以报之”。
    于是，我们把“迎春曲”，从今日起改作“跃进之歌”。
    然而，跃进是六亿人民的大跃进，是各个生活方面的大跃进，仅靠作家和诗人，即使贡献他们全部精力，怕也只能反映这跃进的万一。于是需要各行各业各种各样的人都来动手，使“跃进之歌”成为真正人民的大合唱。我们要把这种种歌唱反映在“跃进之歌”里。劳动人民的歌唱非常出色，“最好的诗”就是明证。
    十个指头总不会一般齐。我们生活中也总还有落后现象。这毛病虽只发生在一个指头上，我们也要立即去矫正。容忍落后现象存在，是同我们的志气不相称的。于是我们还需要有进一步的锋利的批评。人民已经在生活中发扬了这种火辣的批评，我们要把它反映到副刊上来；副刊需要更多的杂文。盼大家都来动手。
