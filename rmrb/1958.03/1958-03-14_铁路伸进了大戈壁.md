The construction of the Lanxin Railway has advanced into Xinjiang. Along the more than 300-kilometer section from Xiadong in Gansu to Hami in Xinjiang, construction workers are building roadbeds and bridge culverts; track laying can begin westward from Xiadong in the second quarter.

The area currently under construction is the vast Gobi Desert, known as the "Eight Hundred Li of瀚海". Water is scarce, there are large sandstorms, and it is desolate. The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has built many reservoirs along the line and mobilized a large number of water tank trucks to transport engineering and domestic water non-stop from dozens of kilometers away. Relevant units have also established a number of shops here, specializing in transporting various daily necessities from Lanzhou, Hami, and other places to supply employees. In order to reduce the encroachment of sandstorms, most of the workshops have their lower halves buried under the Gobi, with only the roofs and windows exposed above the horizon.

    铁路伸进了大戈壁
    兰新铁路筑路工程已推进到新疆境内。在甘肃峡东到新疆哈密间的三百多公里线路上，施工人员已在修筑路基和桥梁涵洞；到第二季度，就可以开始从峡东继续向西铺轨了。
    目前正在施工的地带是号称“八百里瀚海”的大戈壁。缺水，风沙大，荒无人烟。铁道部第一工程局已经在沿线建设了许多蓄水池，调集大批水槽汽车，川流不息地从数十公里外运来工程用水和生活用水。有关单位还在这里建立了一批商店，专门从兰州、哈密等地运来各种生活必需品，供应职工。为了减少风沙的侵袭，大部分工房把下半截埋在戈壁下面，只有屋顶、窗户露出在地平线上。（新华社）
