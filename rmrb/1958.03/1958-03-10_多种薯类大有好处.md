This newspaper reported on the 4th of this month that Shanxi Province had decided to expand the planting area of potato crops. The CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee, in a recent directive, requested that the province's potato planting area this year should increase by at least 70% compared to 1957, striving to increase it by one-fold. It was also decided that from this year onwards, potato crops would be formally listed as one of the main varieties for unified grain purchase. The CPC Hebei Provincial Committee and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee also issued a joint directive on the 5th of this month, requiring the province to complete the plan to plant 20 million mu of potato crops this year. The directive stated that if this plan is completed, this single item could increase grain production by 5 billion jin compared to last year, fundamentally reversing the historical grain shortage situation in Hebei Province. Now Shanxi Province and Hebei Province are taking a series of active measures to increase potato production, which is very important. All regions across the country should quickly include the issue of developing potato production in the important agenda of current production leadership.

As everyone knows, potato crops are high-yield crops. The average yield per mu of sweet potatoes and potatoes can reach over one to two thousand jin. In 1957, potato crops accounted for 8.7% of the area of grain crops nationwide, and the yield accounted for about 12% of the total grain output. In 1957, the average yield per mu of grain nationwide was 204.6 jin, while the average yield per mu of potato crops was 269.9 jin (calculated at four jin of potatoes equaling one jin of grain), which is more than 30% higher than the national grain unit yield. Among all grain crops, the unit area yield of potato crops is second only to rice. One of the main experiences of Shandong Province in transforming from a grain-deficient province to a surplus province is planting multiple potato varieties. At present, the unit yield of potato crops is not high, and its potential for increased production is still much greater. Last year, many agricultural cooperatives emerged with average potato yields reaching around 10,000 jin per mu. In Hunan Province alone, last year there were 10,300 mu of land with an average yield of over 10,000 jin per mu. The 78 mu of sweet potatoes in the Dacheng First Agricultural Cooperative in Yongxing County, a mountainous area of Hunan Province, averaged over 9,000 jin per mu, of which 1.7 mu averaged 30,000 jin per mu, and more than 22 mu averaged 10,000 jin per mu. The Shufang First Agricultural Cooperative in Jianyang County, a mountainous area of Fujian Province, harvested an average of 15,652 jin of sweet potatoes per mu on 1.2 mu of high-yield land last year. In other grain crops, there have been no records of yields as high as those of potato crops.

In recent years, the planting area of potato crops in our country has increased considerably, especially in 1956. After vigorous promotion by the leadership, both the planting area and the yield of potato crops increased significantly. However, in 1957, due to the influence of right-leaning conservative thinking, many places were not active in developing potato production, so that places that could have increased production more did not increase production in large quantities, and some places even reduced production. This cannot but be said to be a loss. According to statistics, the average potato production per capita in the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany is many times higher than that in our country. These fraternal countries have always attached great importance to potato production. With a large population and limited land in our country, we should develop more potato crops and other high-yield crops. It should be recognized that under the current conditions, making every effort to develop the production of potato crops and other high-yield crops plays a significant role in accelerating grain production in our country and improving our grain supply and reserve situation.

Some people are not active enough in developing potato production, not because they don't know that potato crops have high yields, but because their views on potato crops are not correct enough. In their opinion, if more potato crops are produced, people will not like to eat them, and there will be no market for them. In fact, this is underestimating the value of potato crops and looking at the use of potato crops too narrowly. According to scientists' analysis, the nutritional value of potato crops is quite good. For example, sweet potatoes contain a large amount of sugar and starch, as well as a relatively large amount of minerals and vitamins. Potatoes also have good nutritional value. Many farmers in various places like to eat sweet potatoes and use them as staple food. In Jindong, Jinbei, and Jinxi Northwest in Shanxi Province and parts of Gansu Province, the vast majority of farmers have always regarded potatoes as staple food. If more potato crops are produced, more urban and rural people can be made to eat potato crops in combination with other grains. Potato crops have wider uses in industry, but unfortunately, we have not made good use of them. Potatoes can be mixed with flour to make a variety of foods, and can also be used to make starch. The powder residue left over from making starch can be used to make wine, vinegar, and sauce. Sweet potatoes have similar uses. The brewing industry, food industry, and catering industry in various parts of Sichuan Province have used sweet potatoes to trial-produce 142 kinds of palatable foods such as wine, sauce, vinegar, candy, pastries, and dishes, which are welcomed by the vast urban and rural people. The vines and leaves of sweet potatoes are good feed for pigs and cattle. Planting potato crops and using by-products as feed is the most cost-effective way when arable land is limited. Since potato crops have so much economic value, all ideas that underestimate potato crops and fail to actively increase their production are of course incorrect.

Some people also use the reason that potato crops are not easy to store to oppose developing potato production. Compared to other grains, potato crops do have the disadvantage of being difficult to store. However, many facts have proven that if we can achieve meticulous harvesting, proper storage, prevention of diseases and pests, and timely organization of purchase, supply and processing, and promote the method of slicing, drying, and grinding into powder to expand the scope of utilization, we can not only minimize the loss of potato crops from rotting, but also greatly save the consumption of other grains.

In short, we should regard potato crops as an important grain and should appropriately develop potato production in areas suitable for planting potato crops.

Planting potato crops is not an unfamiliar matter for many regions. However, in order to ensure increased potato production, the leading organs must make many specific arrangements. Shanxi Province has decided that from this year onwards, potato crops will be listed as one of the varieties for unified grain purchase, stipulating the proportion of potato crops in the unified grain purchase and supply, and has decided to actively build small enterprises such as starch processing plants and sweet potato alcohol manufacturing plants near potato producing areas. Such arrangements are fully in line with the wishes and requirements of the vast majority of farmers in potato producing areas. With arrangements made in this regard, the farmers' concerns will be eliminated, so that they will be able to plant potato crops with peace of mind.

In order to increase potato production, in addition to appropriately expanding the planting area in accordance with local conditions, we should also strive to increase the yield per unit area. At present, the national average unit yield of sweet potatoes and potatoes is still far from the highest yield. Whether it is a new or old potato planting area, there is great potential to be tapped in terms of increasing the unit yield of potato crops. There are many records of potato yields of 10,000 jin per mu in every province, and yields of around 5,000 jin are even more common everywhere. These high-yield records and model examples all show that our farmers' experience in cultivating potato crops is very rich. Summarizing these experiences and applying them to this year's development of potato production is an important task. The meticulousness and extensiveness of potato planting techniques and the quality of varieties are important factors determining the level of unit yield. Only by doing these tasks well can we greatly increase the yield per unit area of potato crops.

The development of potato production requires vigorous support from all sides. The solution of problems such as the processing and utilization of potato crops requires grain departments and relevant local enterprises to think of more ways. The spread of black spot disease can lead to the rotting of sweet potatoes; late blight is a devastating disease of potatoes. To prevent and eliminate their harm, we must rely on the efforts of agricultural science and research departments. Adjusting potato seeds and supplying tools for slicing and drying potato crops, in particular, requires the support of supply and marketing cooperatives. We believe that the vast number of workers in grain departments, agricultural science departments, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other departments will be willing to use their actions to support and promote the development of potato production!

    多种薯类大有好处
    本报于本月4日报道了山西省决定扩大薯类种植面积的消息，中共山西省委和山西省人民委员会在最近发出的指示中，要求全省今年薯类种植面积至少要比1957年增加70％，努力争取增加一倍。还决定从今年起将薯类正式列为粮食统购的主要品种之一。中共河北省委和河北省人民委员会也于本月5日发出联合指示，要求全省完成今年种植薯类二千万亩的计划。指示说，如果完成了这个计划，只此一项就能比去年增产粮食五十亿斤，从根本上扭转河北省历史上缺粮的情况。现在山西省和河北省都正在采取一系列积极的措施来增产薯类，这是很重要的。全国各地都应当赶快把发展薯类生产的问题列入当前生产领导的重要议题之内。
    大家知道，薯类是高产作物。甘薯和马铃薯平均每亩产量都可达到一两千斤以上。1957年全国薯类占粮食作物面积的8.7％，产量占粮食总产量的12％左右。1957年全国粮食按播种面积平均亩产量是二百零四点六斤，而薯类平均亩产量却有二百六十九点九斤（按四斤薯折一斤粮食计算），比全国粮食单位产量高出30％以上。在所有的粮食作物中，薯类的单位面积产量仅次于稻谷。山东省由缺粮省变成余粮省，主要的经验之一是多种薯类。现在薯类的单位产量并不算高，它的增产潜力还大得多。去年，薯类平均亩产量达到万斤上下的农业合作社出现了好多。仅仅湖南省去年就有一万零三百亩地平均亩产量达到一万斤以上。湖南省山区的永兴县大城第一农业合作社的七十八亩甘薯，平均每亩产九千多斤，其中有一点七亩平均每亩产三万斤，有二十二亩多，平均每亩产一万斤。福建省山区的建阳县书坊第一农业合作社去年有一亩二分丰产田平均每亩收甘薯一万五千六百五十二斤。在其他粮食作物里，还没有出现能赶上薯类这样高的产量记录的。
    近几年来，我国薯类种植面积增加了不少，特别是1956年，经过领导方面大力提倡，薯类种植面积和产量都显著增加了。但是，在1957年，由于右倾保守思想的影响，许多地方对于发展薯类生产又不积极了，以致本来可以增产更多的地方，却没有大量增产，有些地方甚至减产。这不能不说是一种损失。根据统计资料，苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国平均每人所有的薯产量都比我国高好多倍。这些兄弟国家历来就很重视薯类生产，我国人多地少，更应该多发展薯类和其他高产作物。应该认识到，在目前条件下，尽量发展薯类和其他高产作物的生产，对于加速我国的粮食增产和改善我国粮食供应和储备状况，都有很大的作用。
    有些人对于发展薯类生产不够积极，并不是不知道薯类的产量高，而是因为对于薯类的看法不够正确。照他们看来，薯类生产得多了，人们不爱吃，没有销路。其实，这是把薯类的身价贬得太低了，把薯类的用处看得太窄了。根据科学家的分析，薯类的营养价值是相当好的。如甘薯含有大量的糖分和淀粉，还含有较多的矿物质和维生素。马铃薯的营养价值也好。不少地方的农民都很喜欢吃红薯，而且当做主食。在山西省的晋东、晋北、晋西北等地和甘肃省的部分地区，广大农民向来都把马铃薯当主食。如果薯类生产得多了，就可以使更多的城乡人民把薯类和其他粮食配合食用。薯类在工业上的用途更广，可惜我们还没有很好地加以利用。马铃薯可以与面粉掺用制成多种食品，还可以制造淀粉，制淀粉剩下的粉渣可以造酒、醋和酱；甘薯也有类似的用途，四川省各地酿造业、食品业、饮食业利用甘薯试制成酒、酱、醋、糖果、糕点、菜肴等一百四十二种可口的食品，受到城乡广大人民的欢迎。甘薯的蔓藤叶是猪、牛的好饲料。种植薯类，用副产品做饲料，在耕地有限的情况下是最上算的。既然薯类有这么多的经济价值，那么一切轻视薯类、不去积极增产薯类的想法，当然是不对的了。
    还有人以薯类不易储藏为理由，不主张发展薯类生产。薯类比起别的粮食，的确有不易储藏的缺点。但是，许多事实证明，如果能做到收获细致，保管得法，预防病害，再加上及时组织收购、供应和加工，推广切片、晒干、磨粉的办法，扩大利用范围，不仅可以把薯类腐烂的损失减少到最小限度，还可以大大节省其他粮食的消耗。
    总之，我们应当把薯类当做一种重要的粮食看待，应当在适于种植薯类的地区，适当地发展薯类生产。
    种植薯类作物对于许多地区说，不是什么生疏的事情。可是为了保证薯类增产，领导机关必须进行许多具体的安排。山西省决定由今年起将薯类列为粮食统购的品种之一，规定了粮食统购和供应中薯类所占的比例，并且决定在临近薯类产区积极兴建淀粉加工厂和薯类酒精制造厂等小型企业等。这样的安排，是完全符合薯类产区广大农民的愿望和要求的。在这方面安排好了，农民的顾虑就消除了，这样他们就会放心地种植薯类作物了。
    为了增加薯类生产，除了因地制宜地适当地扩大种植面积外，还应当努力提高单位面积产量。目前甘薯、马铃薯的全国平均单位产量，离最高产量还很远。不论新、老种植薯类的地区，在提高薯类单位产量方面都大有潜力可挖。亩产万斤薯的记录，每省都有不少；五千斤左右的产量，更是各地常见的。这些丰产记录和模范事例都说明，我国农民栽培薯类作物的经验是十分丰富的。总结这些经验，把它用在今年发展薯类生产上，是一件重要工作。薯类种植技术的精细和粗放，品种的好坏，都是决定单位产量高低的重要因素。只有把这些工作切实做好，才能大大提高薯类单位面积产量。
    发展薯类生产更需要各个方面的大力支援。薯类的加工、利用等问题的解决，就需要粮食部门和有关的地方企业多想办法。黑斑病的传播，会导致甘薯的腐烂；晚疫病更是马铃薯的毁灭性的病害。要防治和消灭它们的危害，就要靠农业科学试验研究部门的努力。调剂薯种、供应薯类切片晒干的工具等，尤其需要供销合作部门给以支持。我们相信，粮食部门、农业科学部门、供销合作等部门的广大工作者，一定愿意用自己的行动来支援和促进薯类生产的发展！
