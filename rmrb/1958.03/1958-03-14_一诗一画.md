    A Poem and a Painting
    Poem by Zuo Hai, Painting by Miao Yintang
    The small cart delivering goods rests by the street,
    The old and young gather like a market town.
    Let everyone select and purchase freely,
    The "seven necessities" for daily life are all here.

    左海诗  缪印堂画
    小车送货歇街边，
    老幼围观似市?。
    一任大家多选购，
    开门七件算齐全。
