Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Statement by the Government of the People's Republic of China

On March 7, 1958, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a letter to the South Vietnamese authorities condemning the United States for its increasingly blatant interference in South Vietnam in violation of the Geneva Accords and for obstructing the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. He specifically suggested that the North and South Vietnamese authorities meet as soon as possible to discuss ways to reduce their respective armies and seek mutual trade to promote the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. This is another major effort by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to realize the peaceful reunification of its country by all the Vietnamese people, to implement the Geneva Accords, and to ease tensions in Indochina and Asia. The Chinese government fully supports this timely and proactive peace initiative of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Since the restoration of peace in the three Indochinese countries under the Geneva Accords, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has continuously strived to further achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. However, due to the interference of the United States, more than a year has passed since the date stipulated in the Geneva Accords for holding free general elections in Vietnam, and Vietnam remains divided, which is intolerable to all the Vietnamese people from North to South.

Not only that, but the United States has also sent a large number of military personnel to South Vietnam, shipped in reinforcing military supplies, and established military bases. The United States not only openly placed South Vietnam under the so-called "protection" of the Manila aggressive bloc, but also tried every possible means to further drag South Vietnam into the Manila group. All of these are serious violations of the Geneva Accords. This policy of the United States not only hinders the peaceful reunification desired by the Vietnamese people, but also threatens peace and security in Southeast Asia. As a signatory to the Geneva Accords and a close neighbor of the Indochinese countries, China cannot but express its serious concern about this situation.

The provision of the Geneva Accords regarding the reunification of Vietnam through free general elections must be realized. According to the public statement of the representative of the United States attending the Geneva Conference, the United States has an obligation not to hinder the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The Chinese government believes that the proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam should be seriously considered and adopted by the South Vietnamese authorities. At the same time, we have reason to demand that the United States government abide by its own promises and stop interfering in South Vietnam. The Chinese government also hopes that all participating countries of the Geneva Conference and all countries and peoples concerned about peace in Indochina and Asia will take a positive attitude towards the initiative of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    我政府声明支持越南民主共和国和平倡议
    要求美国遵守日内瓦协议及其诺言，停止对越南的干涉
    新华社9日讯　中华人民共和国政府声明
    1958年3月7日，越南民主共和国范文同总理致函南越当局谴责美国违反日内瓦协议对南越进行日益露骨的干涉和阻挠越南的和平统一，并且具体建议，越南南北当局早日会晤、讨论双方裁减军队和寻求互通贸易的办法，以促进越南的和平统一。这是越南民主共和国政府为了实现全体越南人民和平统一自己的国家、贯彻实施日内瓦协议和和缓印度支那和亚洲紧张局势所作的又一次重大努力。中国政府完全支持越南民主共和国政府。这一适时的、主动的和平倡议。
    自从印度支那三国根据日内瓦协议恢复和平以来，越南民主共和国政府就不断为进一步实现越南的和平统一而努力。但是由于美国的干涉，日内瓦协议所规定的在越南举行自由普选的日期已过去了一年多的时间，而越南仍然处于被分裂的状态，这是从南到北，全体越南人民所不能容忍的。
    不仅如此，美国还向南越派遣大量军事人员，运进增援性的军事物资和建立军事基地，美国不但公然把南越置于马尼拉侵略集团的所谓“保护”之下，而且还千方百计、企图进一步把南越拉入马尼拉集团。所有这些都是严重地违反日内瓦协议的行为。美国的这种政策不但阻挠了越南人民所渴望的和平统一，而且还威胁着东南亚地区的和平和安全。作为日内瓦协议的签字国和印度支那各国的近邻，中国不能不对这种情况表示严重的关切。
    日内瓦协议关于通过自由普选实现越南统一的规定必须实现。根据美国出席日内瓦会议的代表的公开声明，美国负有义务不妨害日内瓦协议的实施。中国政府认为，越南民主共和国政府的建议应该得到南越当局认真的考虑和采纳。同时，我们有理由要求美国政府遵守它自己的诺言，停止对南越的干涉。中国政府并且希望所有日内瓦会议的参加国和一切关心印度支那和亚洲和平的国家和人民对于越南民主共和国政府的倡议采取积极态度。　1958年3月9日
