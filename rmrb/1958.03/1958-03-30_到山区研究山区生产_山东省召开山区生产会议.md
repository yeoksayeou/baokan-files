To Study Mountain Production in Mountainous Areas
Shandong Province Holds Mountain Production Conference

    (Our dispatch from Jinan, March 29) Recently, Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, convened a provincial mountain production conference in the Yimeng Mountain area. The participating cadres, led by Shu Tong himself, adopted a method of listening, observing, discussing, and doing simultaneously, effectively resolving many practical problems in the Great Leap Forward of mountain production.

    Throughout the conference, there were no complete sets of documents, reports, or summaries. Everyone started from reality, raised questions, exchanged experiences, and discussed solutions. If something was not understood, they would go and observe; if they didn't know how to do something, they would start doing it themselves. The conference was filled with a spirit of learning and practice, and a lively atmosphere.

    The spirit of the masses in Xiawei Township, Yishui County, fighting against the poor mountains and bad waters under the organization and leadership of the Township Party Committee, as well as their arduous, tenacious, and boldly creative spirit, became the living document of this conference. After Wang Hengquan, the Party Secretary of this township, returned from a visit to Henan, he creatively applied Henan's mountain management experience to govern the mountains in his township. He not only learned a complete set of mountain management techniques such as surveying, design, and construction, but also quickly cultivated a technical team in the township by adopting a method of teaching while doing. More than sixty people learned the complete set of skills, and more than one hundred people mastered partial techniques. From January to mid-March of this year, they have already treated twenty-nine large mountains and improved more than 8,900 mu of terraced fields, with more than 20,000 mu of land that can be irrigated. Shu Tong and all the participating cadres focused on visiting the management projects of Niujia Gu and Zhujia Ping mountains in this township and were greatly inspired and encouraged. These large mountains, which span dozens of miles, used to be crisscrossed by ravines, and flash floods and soil erosion were extremely serious during the rainy season. Now, from the top of the mountain to the bottom of the valley, they are covered with more than twenty kinds of projects such as fish-scale pits and contour trenches. In particular, the ring of mountain-encircling water storage ponds on the mountainside is like a huge chain that tightly binds the fierce mountains. Various projects form a complex water storage system and a huge soil and water conservation network, which can ensure that even with 200 millimeters of rainfall, "water does not go down the mountain, and soil does not leave the valley." Everyone unanimously believed that the conditions in other mountainous areas are generally better than those in Xiawei Township. If the leaders of each county take the hard work and dedication of Xiawei Township as an example, the pace of mountain management in the province can be greatly accelerated.

    A field labor session was also organized during the meeting. All participating cadres and more than 3,900 people from party and government departments, enterprises, schools, and the army in Yishui County launched an attack on "Luogu Mountain," which was full of rocks. In just one day, its appearance was basically changed.

    This on-site meeting lasted six days from March 19th to 24th. Everyone said that the gains were richer and more practical than some of the meetings held in the past. Shu Tong described the meeting in this way at the adjournment: "No documents, no reports, no summaries; ears have heard, eyes have seen, hands have moved, brains have thought, hearts have gained."

    到山区研究山区生产
    山东省召开山区生产会议
      本报济南29日电　中共山东省委第一书记舒同最近在沂蒙山区召开了全省山区生产会议。与会干部由舒同亲自率领，采取边听边看边议边做的方法，切实有效地解决了山区生产大跃进中的许多实际问题。
    会议自始至终没有整本成套的文件、报告和总结。大家从实际出发提出问题，交流经验，商讨办法。听不懂的事情就去看，看不会的就下手做。会议充满了学习、实践的精神和生动活泼的气氛。
    沂水县夏蔚乡的群众在中共乡委的组织领导下向穷山恶水搏斗的气概，以及他们艰苦顽强、大胆创造的精神，成为这次会议的活的文献。这个乡的乡委书记王恒全去河南参观回来后，创造性地运用河南的治山经验来治理本乡的山岭，他不仅自己学会了勘查、设计和施工等一整套的治山技术，并且采取边做边教的办法迅速在全乡培养出一支技术队伍，学会全套本领的六十多人，会部分技术的一百多人，他们从今年1月到3月中旬，已治好大山头二十九个，整好梯田八千九百余亩，有二万多亩地可以得到浇灌。舒同和与会全体干部着重地参观了这个乡的牛家崮、朱家坪两座山头的治理工程，受到很大启发和鼓舞。这些方圆数十里的大山，过去沟壑纵横，每遇雨季山洪暴发，水土流失异常严重；现在，从山顶到沟底，已布满鱼鳞坑、水平沟等二十余种工程，特别是山腰上一道道围山连环蓄水池，像一条巨大的索链把凶山团团捆住。各种工程组成了一个复杂的蓄水系统和庞大的水土保持网，可以保证遇有二百公厘的雨量时，“水不下山，土不出川”。大家一致认为其它山区条件一般比夏蔚乡要好些，如果各县领导上都以夏蔚乡的干劲、钻劲为榜样，全省山区治理的步伐还可大大加速。
    会中还组织了一次实地劳动，全体与会干部和沂水县党政、企业、学校及部队共三千九百余人，向满山乱石的“锣鼓山”发起进攻：仅一天的时间就基本上改变了它的面貌。
    这次现场会议自3月19日到24日共开了六天，大家说比过去开的某些会收获丰富而踏实。舒同在散会时对这次会议作了这样的描述：“一无文件，二无报告，三无总结；耳有所闻，目有所睹，手有所动，脑有所思，心有所得。”（康宁）
