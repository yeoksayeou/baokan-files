    Wuhan Prepares to Build a Large Fertilizer Plant

    (Our dispatch) To promote a great leap forward in agricultural production, Wuhan City will build a large-scale chemical fertilizer plant this year. Once completed, this plant will produce 440,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, 400,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, and 120,000 tons of synthetic ammonia annually.

    The total investment for this plant is over 220 million yuan. In addition to auxiliary workshops, the entire plant will consist of nine major workshops for synthetic ammonia, nitrogen fertilizer, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, phosphate fertilizer, ethylbenzene, lime, sand and gravel processing, and air separation.

    The first phase of construction and installation is scheduled to begin in June of this year and go into production in the first half of 1961.

    Currently, the preparatory unit and construction departments have dispatched a large number of administrative management cadres and engineering technicians to Jilin, Lanzhou, and other places to learn from their construction experience.
