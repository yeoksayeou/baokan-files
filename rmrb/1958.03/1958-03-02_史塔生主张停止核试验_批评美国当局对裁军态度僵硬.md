Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 1st Dispatch: Harold Stassen, former special advisor on disarmament to the U.S. President, reaffirmed on February 28th his recent proposal for a bilateral agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union to halt nuclear testing for two years. He also put forward a four-point plan regarding this proposal.

The four points are: the United States and the Soviet Union unanimously agree that the U.S. Senate and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union approve a two-year trial period of cessation of nuclear testing; during the two-year cessation period, negotiations will be held to formulate further disarmament steps; a United Nations committee will be established to oversee the implementation of all agreements reached; and the agreement will mutually open territories to establish eleven or twelve inspection stations.

Stassen said that stopping the production of fissionable materials requires an extremely complex monitoring system, and treating this as a prerequisite for stopping nuclear testing greatly undermines the possibility of reaching any agreement.

Stassen also stated that he disagrees with the attitude of U.S. President Eisenhower, who, using the excuse that the various allies of the United States in the North Atlantic group are at different stages of developing nuclear weapons and therefore need to conduct production and testing, refused to reach an agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to stop nuclear testing.

Stassen believes that members of the North Atlantic group will not necessarily oppose his proposal. He cited Canada, Norway, and Denmark as examples, saying that these countries are in favor of reaching such a preliminary agreement. He also said that the approval of any other country is not a "necessary" condition for obtaining such an agreement. No matter what decisions some of America's allies make, it will not affect the importance of the two major powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, taking the first step, nor will it adversely affect the success of this agreement.

Stassen criticized Dulles' insistence on a "package deal" approach to solving disarmament issues, saying, "If we try to go too far in our initial step, we won't be able to take a single step."

Stassen advocated that, after the first step agreement is reached, a broader disarmament agreement involving all countries, including China, should be considered.

Stassen also suggested holding a top-level meeting in the United Nations immediately. He said that his plan could best be completed at a top-level meeting. He said, "If preparations are started now, the top-level meeting can be convened within the next five months."

    史塔生主张停止核试验
    批评美国当局对裁军态度僵硬
    据新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统前裁军问题特别顾问史塔生2月28日重申他最近提出的美国和苏联达成双边协议停止核试验两年的主张。并且提出了关于这一主张的四点计划。
    这四点计划是：美国和苏联一致同意由美国参议院和苏联最高苏维埃批准双方在两年试行时期停止核试验；在两年停止试验期间，举行谈判以订出进一步的裁军步骤；建立一个联合国委员会，来视察所达成的一切协议的执行情况；协议互相开放领土以建立十一个或十二个视察站。
    史塔生说，停止裂变物质生产需要极为复杂的监督制度，把这当作停止核试验的先决条件，就大大损害了达成任何协议的可能性。
    史塔生还表示他不同意美国总统艾森豪威尔的态度，艾森豪威尔曾经以美国在北大西洋集团中的各盟国处在发展核武器的不同阶段因而需要进行生产和试验为借口，拒绝达成美苏两国停止核试验的协议。
    史塔生认为，北大西洋集团成员国不一定会反对他的建议。他以加拿大、挪威、丹麦为例，说这些国家是赞成达成这种初步协议的。他还说，任何其他国家的赞成并不是获致这种协议的“必不可少的”条件。不管美国的某些盟国作出什么决定，都不会影响美苏两大国采取第一步的重要性，也不会对这个协议的成功产生不利影响。
    史塔生批评杜勒斯坚持的“一揽子”解决裁军问题的做法，他说，“如果我们最初的一步想走得太远的话，那我们一步也走不成。”
    史塔生主张，在第一步协议达成之后，再来考虑使所有的国家，包括中国在内，参加的更为广泛的裁军协定。
    史塔生还建议立即在联合国举行最高级会议。他说，他的计划最好能在最高级会议上完成。他说，“如果现在开始准备工作的话，最高级会议可以在今后五个月内召开。”
