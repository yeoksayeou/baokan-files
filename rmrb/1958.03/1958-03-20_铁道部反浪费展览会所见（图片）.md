Sights from the Ministry of Railways' Anti-Waste Exhibition

　　The original 1958 planned targets were too conservative.

　　A box of parts, stored for many years, transferred several times. What's inside?

　　Just from being so picky, the railway department wasted 190,000 cubic meters of wood from 1953 to 1956, incurring a loss of approximately 15 million yuan.

　　The design work at the Chongqing Locomotive Repair Factory changed eight times, wasting more than 2,000 workdays.

　　The Beijing Sanatorium spent 18,000 yuan to build a fountain, but there was no return pipe.

    铁道部反浪费展览会所见

    原来的1958年的计划指标太保守了。
    一箱机件，保管多年，移交数次，里面是甚么？
    就是这样挑剔，铁道部门1953年到1956年，浪费了十九万立方公尺木材，损失约一千五百万元。
    重庆机车修理厂的设计工作变动了八次，浪费了两千多工作日。
    北京疗养院花了一万八千元修个喷水池，却没有回水管。
