Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th - According to reports, Lieutenant Colonel Mei Lin, Deputy Head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, wrote a letter to the International Commission on March 10, protesting the terroristic actions of the South Vietnamese authorities in Quang Nam Province. The letter pointed out that, beginning on July 20th of last year, the South Vietnamese authorities launched a new so-called "Denounce Communists" movement throughout Quang Nam Province. This movement was directed by personnel from the South Vietnamese "Presidential Palace." Tens of thousands of people who had previously participated in the resistance against French colonial rule, families with relatives gathered in the North, and those who favored peaceful reunification were subjected to arrest, torture, and robbery.

The letter emphasized that in Gui Shan County alone, the South Vietnamese authorities arrested 500 people and announced that they would be imprisoned indefinitely.

Currently, one-third of these people have developed edema. The South Vietnamese authorities have already dug many pits in advance, preparing to bury those who die from torture and abuse.

On the same day, the Liaison Delegation of the People's Army also wrote another letter to the International Commission, accusing the South Vietnamese authorities of persecuting people who had previously participated in the resistance against French colonial rule in An Phu District, Zhu Du Province, near the Cambodian border.

The Liaison Delegation believes that the aforementioned actions of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime seriously violate Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords, and requests the International Commission to intervene.

    越南方面致函国际委员会
    抗议南越迫害前抗战人员
    据新华社河内12日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团副团长梅林中校3月10日写信给国际委员会，抗议南越当局在广南省的恐怖行为。信中指出，从去年7月20日开始，南越当局在广南省全省发动了新的所谓“诉共”运动。指挥这一运动的是南越“总统府”的人员。成千上万的前参加过抗战的人民，有亲属集结到北方的家庭，以及赞成和平统一的人都遭到逮捕、拷打和抢劫。
    信中强调说，南越当局仅在桂山一县就抓走了五百人，并宣布要把他们无限期地关在监牢里。
    目前这些人已有三分之一得了浮肿病。南越当局已经预先挖好了许多土坑，准备用来掩埋因受拷打和虐待至死的人。
    同一天，人民军联络代表团还另外写了一封信给国际委员会，控诉南越当局在靠近柬埔寨边境的朱笃省安富郡对前参加过抗战的人民的迫害行为。
    联络代表团认为，吴庭艳政权的上述行为严重地违反了日内瓦协议第十四条丙款，要求国际委员会加以干涉。
