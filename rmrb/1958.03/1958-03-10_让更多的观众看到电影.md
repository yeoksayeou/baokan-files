    Let More Audiences See Movies
    Lin Bi
    People are very excited after reading the leap forward plan of the film industry to produce more films. However, there is another extremely important link between the film studio and the 600 million audiences, and that is the distribution and screening work. Distribution and screening workers are the bridge between films and audiences. Without them, producing more films would be in vain.
    As film production units take the lead, distribution and screening units need to keep up. Now, film distribution and screening workers have made a guarantee to the broad masses of the audience: to increase the number of viewers and screenings so that more people can see movies; to improve the utilization rate of copies and give full play to the role of existing copies so that each film copy can serve more people; and to improve the quality of screenings. This is the second march in the overall leap forward of the film industry, fully demonstrating the ambition and spirit of the film workers in the leap forward.
    In the past eight years, film distribution and screening work has made great achievements. The number of film screening units has increased from less than a thousand to more than ten thousand, and the number of viewers has increased every year, reaching more than 2 billion last year. In recent years, a large number of advanced workers, especially screening teams, have emerged in the national screening units. They go to the countryside, up the mountains, down to factories and mines, and down to companies, overcoming various difficulties to bring movies to the door to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, there are also some shortcomings in the distribution and screening work. For example, improper film selection, translating some foreign films with defects and errors; improper program supply, sending some more specialized art films to factories and rural areas for screening; and poor service attitude, failing to fully take care of the audience and provide convenience to the audience, etc. It is particularly noteworthy that there is a serious backlog of copies, and a considerable number of copies that can be distributed and screened exist in warehouses, never seeing the light of day or meeting the audience, which wastes national resources and reduces the utilization rate of films. Among some distribution and screening staff, there is also a tendency to neglect politics, only focusing on screening some light and interesting films, while adopting an unwelcoming attitude towards films with stronger political content (including documentaries and newsreels reflecting the country's economic construction), and not considering the needs of the masses. All these shortcomings are obstacles to the great leap forward. Now, distribution and screening workers have specifically proposed ways to improve these shortcomings. We believe that film screening work will surely be able to leap forward.
    To move forward and leap forward, it is also necessary to further carry out the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. Only in this way can we continue to break with conventions, tap potential strength, give full play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses, and thoroughly implement the principle of diligence and thrift in running undertakings. Film workers must establish the correct view of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the audience, change their service attitude, and bring movies to the door for the audience, so that people in any remote and desolate areas can see movies. Whether it is between screening personnel in the military system, trade union system, and cultural system, or between distribution and screening, we must pay attention to strengthening cooperation, working together, strengthening contact, and forming a whole. Only in this way can film distribution and screening work be done better.

### 让更多的观众看到电影

    让更多的观众看到电影
    林碧
    人们看了电影界多出影片的跃进计划之后，是十分兴奋的。但是，在电影厂和六亿观众之中，还有一个极重要的环节，那就是发行放映工作。发行放映工作者是影片和观众之间的桥梁，没有他们，出再多的影片也是徒然。
    电影的生产单位一马当先，就需要发行放映单位紧跟上去。现在，电影发行放映工作者们已经向广大观众作了保证：增加观众人次场次，使更多的人看到电影；提高拷贝使用率，发挥库存拷贝作用，使每一部电影拷贝能为更多的人服务；提高放映质量。这是电影事业全面大跃进中的第二次进军号，充分显示了电影工作者在跃进中的雄心和壮气。
    八年来，电影发行放映工作做出了很大的成绩。电影放映单位从不足一千个发展到超过一万个，观众人次每年上升，到去年已经有二十亿以上人次。几年来，全国放映单位中还涌现了大批的先进工作者，特别是放映队。他们下乡，上山，下工矿，下连队，克服各种困难把电影送上门去为工农兵服务。但是，发行放映工作中也还有一些缺点。例如选片不当，将一些有缺点有错误的外国影片翻译了；供应节目不当，把一些比较专门的文艺片送到工厂农村放映去了；以及服务态度不好，不能充分照顾观众、便利观众等等。特别值得注意的是拷贝的严重积压，相当大数量的可以发行放映的拷贝存在仓库里，不见天日，不同观众见面，既浪费了国家资财，又降低了影片的利用率。在一些发行放映工作人员中，也还有忽视政治的倾向，只顾放映一些轻松有趣的影片，对于政治性较强的影片（包括反映祖国经济建设的纪录片和新闻简报），却采取不欢迎的态度，也不去考虑一下群众的需要。所有这些缺点，都是大跃进中的障碍。现在，发行放映工作者已经针对这些缺点，具体地提出了改进的办法。我们相信，电影放映工作一定能够向前跃进。
    要前进，要跃进，还必须深入开展反浪费反保守运动，只有这样，才能继续打破陈规，发掘潜在力量，充分发挥群众的创造性、积极性，彻底贯彻勤俭办事业的方针。电影工作者必须树立起为工农兵服务、为观众服务的正确观点，改变服务态度，把电影给观众送上门去，使任何荒山僻野地区的人们都能看到电影。无论是部队系统、工会系统、文化系统的放映人员之间，或发行和放映之间，都要注意搞好协作关系，共同合作，加强联系，结成一个整体。只有这样，才能使电影发行放映工作做得更好。
