Friendly Competition

　　Korea, covered with white snow in winter, and Vietnam, lush with green trees all year round, are two brotherly countries that are far apart, but their people are very close.

　　In July last year, President Ho Chi Minh visited Korea. At a rally of workers at the Pyongyang Textile Factory, he suggested that in order to exchange experiences and learn from each other on the road to building socialism, a friendly labor competition should be launched between the Pyongyang Textile Factory in Korea and the Nam Dinh Textile Factory in Vietnam. This suggestion was warmly welcomed and supported by the workers of the Pyongyang Textile Factory on the spot.

　　Later, the two factories exchanged challenge letters and pennants for the friendship competition.

　　The workers of the Pyongyang Textile Factory set off a new upsurge in the movement to increase production and practice economy, such as more spindles and more machines. Among the rows of hundreds of looms, the looms with the Vietnamese flag inserted were particularly eye-catching. This flag was won by a model production team in the international friendship competition. They received the honorary title of Korean-Vietnamese Production Team, and also accepted the naming certificate for this honorary title awarded by the Nam Dinh Textile Factory.

　　The Nam Dinh Textile Factory workers' saving action of producing one kilogram of yarn with one kilogram of cotton greatly encouraged all the workers of the Pyongyang Textile Factory. Now, the workers of the Pyongyang Textile Factory have put forward the slogan "Cherish every thread of yarn" and launched movements such as "Savings Outposts" and "Look One More Time". Now, the staff of the Nam Dinh Textile Factory have overfulfilled the February plan by 18.5%. The Pyongyang Textile Factory is also preparing to respond to the good news from their Nam Dinh counterparts by overfulfilling the monthly plan.

　　The workers of the Pyongyang Textile Factory and the Nam Dinh Textile Factory in Vietnam are constantly exchanging production experiences through letters. At the same time, they also send each other fabric samples, scrapbooks, and commemorative gifts such as photos of model workers. The friendship between the workers of the two factories is growing and strengthening. In March and April of this year, they will also send representatives to each other to summarize the results of the friendship competition.

    友好竞赛
    冬天白雪复盖的朝鲜和终年绿荫葱茏的越南，这两个兄弟国家虽然相距很远，但两国人民却非常亲近。
    去年7月，胡志明主席到朝鲜访问，他在平壤纺织厂工人的集会上，建议在建设社会主义的道路上，为了互相交流经验、互相学习，在朝鲜平壤纺织厂和越南南定纺织厂之间开展友谊的劳动竞赛。这个建议当场受到了平壤纺织厂工人们的热烈欢迎和拥护。
    后来，这两个工厂互相交换了友谊竞赛的挑战书和锦旗。
    平壤纺织厂的工人们在多锭、多机台等增产节约运动中，掀起了新的高潮。在数百台织布机的行列里，插着越南国旗的织布机特别引人注目。这面旗，是在国际友谊竞赛中模范生产小组荣获的。他们得到了朝越生产小组的光荣称号，还接受了由南定纺织厂授予这个光荣称号的命名书。
    南定纺织厂工人们用一公斤棉花生产一公斤纱的节约行动，对平壤纺织厂全体工人们，起了莫大的鼓舞作用。现在，平壤纺织厂的工人们提出了“爱惜一根纱”的口号，并开展了“节约哨所”和“多看一次”等运动。现在，南定纺织厂的职工们已经超额18.5％完成了2 月份计划。平壤纺织厂也准备同样用超额完成月计划来回答南定同业的捷报。
    平壤纺织厂和越南南定纺织厂的工人，不断用书信交流生产经验，同时，还互寄织品标本、剪贴簿和模范工人的照片等纪念品。两个厂工人的友谊正在日益增进和巩固。今年3、4月，他们还将互派代表总结友谊竞赛的结果。
