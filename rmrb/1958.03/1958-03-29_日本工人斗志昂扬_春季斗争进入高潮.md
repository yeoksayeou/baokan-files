Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The spring struggle of Japanese workers, led by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), demanding improved living standards, launched a large-scale fourth joint action on the 27th, constituting the climax of this struggle.

In this joint action, members of the Private Railway Workers' Union Federation, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, the Japan Harbor Workers' Union, and the Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Union Federation held strikes. Workers in nine departments, including national railways, telecommunications, and postal services, belonging to the Public Corporation Labor Union Council, participated in the joint action by holding meetings at workplaces, etc., because they were deprived of the right to strike. This joint action was taken after the employers insisted on refusing to increase wages.

The private railway workers' strike was the most powerful. After holding a 24-hour strike on the 27th, they launched an indefinite strike on the morning of the 28th involving 70% of ticket sellers and ticket collectors in eleven large private railway companies and 30% in twenty-four small and medium-sized companies.

The indefinite key strike started by the Japan Coal Miners' Union on the 21st of this month in fifteen mines of four major companies such as "Mitsui" and "Mitsubishi" is still continuing.

Japanese monopoly groups and government authorities are preparing to suppress this spring struggle. Japanese Labor Minister Hirohide Ishida and Postal Minister Kakuei Tanaka both made statements on the 27th, stating that they would punish striking workers with dismissal. The Liberal Democratic Party's Labor Problem Research Committee also instructed the employers of private railway companies on the 26th to suppress workers' demands for wage increases. In Sasebo, there was also an incident in which American soldiers armed with carbines were dispatched to "guard" near the picket lines set up by local striking sailors.

    日本工人斗志昂扬
    春季斗争进入高潮
    据新华社讯　东京消息：由日本工会总评议会领导的日本工人要求改善生活待遇的春季斗争，27日展开了大规模的第四次联合行动，构成了这次斗争的高潮。
    在这次联合行动中，私营铁道工会总联合会、日本煤矿工会、日本港湾工会、合成化学产业工会联合会的会员举行了罢工。属于公共企业工会协议会的国营铁道、电信电话和邮政等九个部门的工人，因为被剥夺了罢工权利，所以采用在工作场所举行大会等方式参加了联合行动。这次联合行动是在资方坚持拒绝增加工资之后采取的。
    私营铁道工人的罢工声势最大，在27日举行了二十四小时罢工以后，28日早晨又分别发动十一家大私营铁道公司和二十四家中小公司中的70％和30％的售票员、收票员展开无限期的罢工。
    日本煤矿工会从本月21日起在“三井”“三菱”等四家大公司的十五个矿山中开始的无限期重点罢工还在继续进行。
    日本垄断集团和政府当局，正在准备镇压这次春季斗争。日本劳动相石田博英和邮政相田中角荣都在27日发表谈话，表示要用解雇的办法处罚罢工工人。执政党自由民主党劳动问题调查会并且在26日指示私营铁道公司的资方，要他们把工人提高工资的要求压制下去。在佐世保，还发生了美国兵拿着卡宾枪出动到当地的罢工海员布置的纠察线附近进行“警戒”的事件。
