Xinhua News Agency, London, 4th: Female students at Oxford University in Britain have launched a boycott movement against male classmates who refuse to participate in the campaign to ban hydrogen bombs.

The movement was launched last weekend. So far, the vast majority of female students at Oxford University no longer dance, watch movies, or participate in other social activities with male students who have not yet joined the movement to demand a ban on hydrogen bombs.

Currently, a campaign demanding that the British government destroy nuclear weapons is underway at Oxford University.

    同不参加反氢弹男生绝交
    据新华社4日讯  伦敦消息：英国牛津大学的女学生向拒绝参加争取禁止氢弹运动的男同学展开了绝交运动。
    这个运动是在上周末发起的。到现在为止，牛津大学的绝大部分女学生都不再同那些还未参加要求禁止氢弹运动的男同学一起跳舞、看电影和参加其他社交活动了。
    目前，在牛津大学正在展开一个要求英国政府销毁核武器的运动。
