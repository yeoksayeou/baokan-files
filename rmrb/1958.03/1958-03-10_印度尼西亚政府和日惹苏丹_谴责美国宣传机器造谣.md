Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 8th: The Indonesian Foreign Ministry announced that the United Press International (UPI) report about Indonesian Ambassador to the Philippines, Mr. Pamoncak, making statements in Manila is fabricated.

The Foreign Ministry stated that Mr. Pamoncak called from Manila on the 6th and said that he did not make the statements reported by UPI: that Hatta would join the government this weekend, and that Djuanda would resign. The ambassador said that this news was fabricated.

The Indonesian Ministry of Information also announced that the Sultan of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, did not say to American reporters in San Francisco that "people in the central government of Indonesia and rebels are equally good people."

The Sultan of Yogyakarta returned to Jakarta on the 7th. He issued a written statement immediately after getting off the plane. He said that there is only one legitimate government in a country, and any other government is considered illegal. In response to questions from reporters, the Sultan of Yogyakarta said that he went to the United States as the head of a tourism delegation, and he never talked about political issues. He said that almost all of his statements in the United States were distorted.

    印度尼西亚政府和日惹苏丹
    谴责美国宣传机器造谣
    据新华社雅加达8日电　印度尼西亚外交部宣布，合众社关于印度尼西亚驻菲律宾大使帕蒙恰克在马尼拉发表谈话的消息是捏造的。
    外交部说，帕蒙恰克6日曾经从马尼拉打来电话说，他并没有说过合众社所报道的这些话：哈达将在本周末参加政府，朱安达将辞职。这位大使说，这项消息是捏造的。
    印度尼西亚情报部也宣布，印度尼西亚日惹苏丹并没有在旧金山对美国记者说过印度尼西亚“中央政府的人和叛乱分子同样都是好人”这种话。
    日惹苏丹在7日回到雅加达。他下了飞机以后马上发表了一篇书面声明。他说，一个国家只有一个合法政府，任何其他政府都被认为是非法的。日惹苏丹在回答记者们提出的问题时说，他是作为观光代表团团长前往美国的，他从来没有谈起过政治问题。他说，他在美国发表的一切声明几乎全被歪曲。
