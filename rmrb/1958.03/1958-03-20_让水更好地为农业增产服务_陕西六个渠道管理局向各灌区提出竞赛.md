Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 19th: In order to promote a great leap forward in agricultural production and ensure that irrigation serves agricultural production increase, six state-owned canal management bureaus in Shaanxi Province have proposed an initiative to conduct friendly competitions with brother irrigation districts across the country. These six state-owned canals are: the Jinghui Canal, Weihui Canal, and Lihui Canal in the cotton and wheat irrigation areas, and the Baoleng Canal, Hanhui Canal, and Xuhui Canal in the rice irrigation areas.

The competition conditions proposed by the cotton and wheat irrigation areas are:

	I. This year, all 2.12 million mu of cultivated land in the entire irrigation area must receive water, eliminating scattered dry land within the irrigation area and expanding the irrigated area by more than 170,000 mu.

	II. Implement advanced irrigation technology. Implement furrow irrigation for all cotton and corn, with standardized furrow specifications, achieving one accuracy (accurate furrowing time), two absences (no curves, no obstacles), and three qualifications (length, depth, and width qualified). Implement small-plot irrigation for all densely planted crops such as wheat.

	III. In coordination with other production increase measures, achieve the targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) nine years ahead of schedule, with grain crops reaching 570 to 818 jin respectively, and ginned cotton reaching 100 to 120 jin.

	IV. Cultivate and promote typical examples. The Jinghui Canal, Weihui Canal, and Lihui Canal will each promote 30 "three-good" cooperatives (good water planning, good field engineering, and good water organization); at the same time, promote several high-yield cooperatives in coordination with other production increase measures.

The competition conditions for the rice irrigation areas are: I. Completely eliminate blank spots within the irrigation area, expand the irrigated area by 96,000 mu, an increase of 22.3% compared to 1957. In general drought years, timely full planting should be achieved, ensuring that more than 440,000 mu of old fields are planted with seedlings seven days before the "Summer Solstice," and more than 90,000 mu of new fields are planted before the "Summer Solstice," and completing 570,000 mu-times of spring irrigation in a timely manner.

	II. Promote advanced irrigation technology. Comprehensively implement methods such as frequent and shallow irrigation, planned sun-drying of fields, and timely water drainage for rice, and implement new methods of soaking fields on an area of 30,000 to 40,000 mu, achieving water arrival, people arrival, cattle arrival, good plowing of field edges, good maintenance of field ridges, and leveling of field surfaces.

	III. In coordination with other production increase measures, achieve the targets of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) nine years ahead of schedule, with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, an increase of 49% compared to 1957.

	IV. Newly build more than 320 ponds and temporary reservoirs, repair 964 existing ponds and reservoirs, storing a total of 14 million cubic meters of water, solving the problem of water for soaking 180,000 mu of rice paddies, achieving a combination of storage and diversion to compensate for the inadequacy of canal water.

In addition, the common conditions they proposed are: I. Comprehensively implement planned water use, with the area of planned water use expanding by 40%-50% compared to 1957. In addition to continuing to improve the water distribution work of main canals and branch canals, more than half of the cooperatives should be able to make their own plans, and the remaining cooperatives should be able to make plans under the guidance of administrators, and earnestly implement water use according to the plan. At the same time, improve the effective utilization coefficient and irrigation efficiency of irrigation water, with the canal irrigation utilization rate increasing by about 10%-20% compared to the past.

	II. Improve the water conservancy organizations of agricultural cooperatives. Each agricultural cooperative must have a deputy director concurrently serving as the water conservancy section chief, and one to three technicians; establish and consolidate irrigation and canal patrol organizations, achieving professional stability, sound systems, and reasonable remuneration.

	III. Strengthen project management. Improve canal system projects below the distribution canal; contract maintenance of canals by section; plant 1.6 million trees on the canals, achieving full greening this year; maintain drainage project standards in a planned manner.

	IV. Impart irrigation technology. The irrigation areas have trained more than 80,000 people, including distribution canal directors, agricultural cooperative water conservancy section chiefs, water conservancy technicians, water measurers, and irrigators, achieving basic mastery of irrigation technology in agricultural cooperatives.

	V. Improve the level of irrigation management work. Strengthen political and technical learning among all management cadres, gradually achieving both red and expert; leading cadres guarantee that they spend one-half of their time going deep into the grassroots, specifically inspecting work and planting experimental fields; personally take action, and at least make one or two special work summaries. General cadres must all cultivate experimental fields well.

    让水更好地为农业增产服务
    陕西六个渠道管理局向各灌区提出竞赛
    新华社西安19日电　为了促进农业生产大跃进，保证灌溉为农业增产服务，陕西省六个国营渠道管理局提出倡议，同全国各兄弟灌区开展友谊竞赛。这六条国营渠道是棉麦灌区的泾惠渠、渭惠渠、洛惠渠，水稻灌区的褒冷渠、汉惠渠、湑惠渠。
    棉麦灌区提出的竞赛条件是：
    一、今年内要使全灌区的二百一十二万亩耕地全部受水，消灭灌区内的零星旱地，扩大灌溉面积十七万多亩。
    二、推行先进的灌溉技术。棉花、玉米全部实行沟灌，沟的规格标准化，做到一准（开沟时间准），二无（无弯曲、无障碍），三合格（长短、深浅、宽窄合格）。小麦等密植作物全部实行小畦灌。
    三、配合其他增产措施，提前九年实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定指标，粮食作物分别达到五百七十斤至八百一十八斤，皮棉达到一百斤至一百二十斤。
    四、培养和推广典型。泾惠渠、渭惠渠、洛惠渠分别推广三十个“三好”社（计划用水好、田间工程好、用水组织好）；同时，配合其他增产措施推广若干丰产社。
    水稻灌区的竞赛条件是：一、全部消灭灌区内的空白点，扩大灌溉面积九万六千亩，比1957年增长22.3％。在一般干旱年，要做到适时满栽，保证四十四万多亩老田在“夏至”前七天，九万多亩新田在“夏至”前，全部栽上秧，并适时完成春灌五十七万亩次。
    二、推广先进的灌溉技术。全面执行水稻的勤浇浅灌、计划晒田、适时退水等方法，并在三四万亩的面积上实行新法泡田，做到水到、人到、牛到、耕好田边、胡好田坎、整平田面。
    三、配合其他增产措施，提前九年实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）指标，亩产达到千斤，比1957年增长49％。
    四、新修塘库、临时水库三百二十多处，整修旧有塘、库九百六十四个，共蓄水一千四百万公方，解决十八万亩水稻泡田用水，达到蓄引相结合，弥补渠水之不足。
    此外，他们提出的共同条件是：一、全面实行计划用水，计划用水的面积比1957年扩大40％—50％。除干渠、支渠配水工作继续提高外，半数以上的社做到能自己做计划，其余各社能在管理员指导下做计划，并切实做到依照计划进行用水。同时，提高灌溉水的有效利用系数及灌溉效率，渠系灌溉利用率分别比过去提高10％—20％左右。
    二、健全农业社水利组织。农业社必须有一个副主任兼任水利股长，有一个到三个技术员；建立与巩固浇地及巡渠组织，达到专业固定，制度健全，报酬合理。
    三、加强工程管理。改善斗渠以下渠系工程；分段包干养护渠道；在渠道植树一百六十万株，今年达到全部绿化；有计划地保持排水工程标准。
    四、传授灌溉技术。灌区共训练斗主任、农业社水利股长、水利技术员、量水员、灌水员等八万多人，达到农业社基本掌握灌溉技术。
    五、提高灌溉管理工作水平。在全体管理干部中加强政治与技术学习，逐步达到又红又专；领导干部保证有二分之一的时间深入下层，具体检查工作和种试验田；亲自动手，至少做出一个到两个专题工作总结。一般干部都要种好试验田。
