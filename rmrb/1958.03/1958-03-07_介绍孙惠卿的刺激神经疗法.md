Introducing Sun Huiqing's Stimulating Nerve Therapy
Ai Changqing

"Your glorious image—the image of a tireless scientific worker, the image of a patriotic and optimistic son of the great Chinese people—will be forever engraved in my heart," wrote Soviet expert Xie S. Giselev to Sun Huiqing, who had cured his long-term high blood pressure.

Sun Huiqing's method of treating diseases is called stimulating nerve therapy. It involves using seven steel needles tied into a cylindrical shape to prick the pain nerve endings on both sides of the spine and in the affected area. Sun Huiqing says: All organs and tissues of the human body function and maintain their integrity under the leadership and command of the central nervous system. Any damage or disturbance to the function of the nerve center will cause lesions in the area it controls, leading to disease. Therefore, he advocates that the treatment of diseases must first adjust the overall balance while taking care of the local area, and not just treat the head when it hurts or the foot when it hurts. When the overall body is strong, local diseases will naturally be resolved. Stimulating nerve therapy eliminates diseases and restores the normal development of various tissues of the body by stimulating nerve excitement through the reflex action of pricking pain, enhancing physiological functions, and adjusting the balance and unity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Because the steel needles stimulate a large number of nerve endings, they will stimulate many neurons (functional units of the nervous system) to excite and move, reciprocally reflecting to exert the functions of various organs and internal organs, enhance resistance, and uniformly adjust the functions of various parts through the central nervous system. Therefore, the basic characteristic of this therapy is to enhance the body's resistance and eliminate diseases through the reflex action of stimulation. Another characteristic of this therapy is that it is simple and easy to perform. First, the technique is simple; and because it only pricks the skin, even beginners will never encounter any danger during treatment. As a result, many patients have also learned the treatment. Secondly, it is economical; only seven steel needles and some alcohol for disinfection are needed to perform the treatment.

The effect of this treatment method is very significant. According to the statistics of the Xiaoboge City Outpatient Department of the Sun Huiqing Stimulation Therapy Treatment Center for more than three months last autumn, 96% of the 337 people who came to him for treatment experienced therapeutic effects, and the therapeutic effect for gastrointestinal diseases and bronchitis reached 98% to 100%. Nan Hanchen suffered from four diseases: high blood pressure, eye hemorrhage, neurasthenia, and rheumatic arthritis. After Sun Huiqing's treatment, all of them have been cured. Wang Yaoqing suffered from arthritis and hemiplegia and had been lying in bed for more than a year. After more than ten treatments by Sun Huiqing, he was able to get out of bed. His wife, Tian Huanying, was so moved that she became Sun Huiqing's student. A Soviet expert suffered from high blood pressure for many years and was cured after more than ten treatments by Sun Huiqing. Child Yao Xiaoyan suffered from encephalitis, with stiff hands and feet and dull eyes. After one treatment by Sun Huiqing, the symptoms were relieved, and she was cured after two treatments. What is particularly noteworthy is that many strange diseases that were ineffective after Chinese and Western medicine treatments have achieved significant results here. Wen Meijun, who suffered from stage IV uterine cancer, was diagnosed by the Central People's Hospital as having only three months to live. After Sun Huiqing's treatment, she has now lived for twenty months, and the condition has been alleviated. According to later examinations by the hospital, her disease has regressed to stage II. Zhang Nansheng's eyes suffered from glaucoma with an intraocular pressure of 60 degrees. After seven months of treatment by Sun Huiqing and his apprentice Xiao Aicheng, the intraocular pressure has been reduced from 60 degrees to 22 degrees, close to normal. His student, who is the vice president of a military hospital, used this method to treat 96 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 8 patients with high blood pressure, and the results were very good. Most of these 96 rheumatoid arthritis patients had anemia, a fast erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and poor sleep. After four weeks of stimulating nerve therapy, they all gained weight and their bodies returned to normal. For example, patient Lu Jinyou had only 3.1 million red blood cells and 50% hemoglobin upon admission, with a moderate erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 51mm. After four treatments, the number of red blood cells increased to 3.5 million, the hemoglobin to 61%, and the moderate erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased to 23mm. By the end of the fourth week, it had basically returned to normal, with red blood cells increasing to 4.5 million, hemoglobin increasing to 71%, and the moderate erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreasing to 9mm. The average high blood pressure of the eight hypertension patients was 170 and the low pressure 145. After one week, the high pressure dropped to 135 and the low pressure to 80. After three weeks, they completely returned to normal. Xiao Aicheng also conducted animal experiments on stimulating nerve therapy. He used a long needle to injure the cervical ganglion of a dog, causing the dog's eyes to be congested and temporarily blind. After more than 30 acupuncture treatments, the dog's eyes regained their sight. This fully demonstrates the enormous role of initiating the body's internal adjustment functions. He proved the excitatory effect of stimulation therapy in the experiment and also proved the inhibitory effect of stimulation therapy. He used a rabbit as an experiment. After injecting 2% 2CC subcutaneous injection (pilocarpine) into the rabbit's ear, the rabbit secreted a large amount of saliva, flowing 37 drops of saliva per minute. After performing the same injection for the second time, acupuncture was performed, and the rabbit's saliva secretion was reduced to 11 drops.

What is particularly worth introducing is Sun Huiqing's method of diagnosing diseases. Based on the principle that the activities of various organs of the human body are controlled by nerve cells, and all nerve cells come from the brain and spinal nerves, any pathological change will cause displacement, deformation, or pain of the vertebrae. Sun Huiqing uses this to make diagnoses. He can find out the location and severity of diseases with impaired nerve activity function by simply touching the spine from bottom to top. The accuracy of this diagnostic method is even higher than X-ray fluoroscopy in some cases. For example, someone who had lung disease in the past that has now calcified can only be detected after multiple fluoroscopies in the hospital, while Sun Huiqing can detect it in one examination, and the location he judges is exactly the same as the fluoroscopy. Another example is rheumatic joint disease, because the bones in the affected area are not deformed, it is difficult to fluoroscope, but it can be diagnosed by touching it with Sun Huiqing's fluoroscopy method.

When Sun Huiqing was forty years old, his son died of illness, and he decided to devote himself to medicine. He recalled seeing farmers in his childhood using ropes to beat people to treat malaria and using scraping and twisting skin methods to treat diseases, which made him think of using pricking pain to treat diseases. So he began research on stimulating nerve therapy. After studying modern physiology, he experimented with stimulating the nerve endings on the skin on both sides of the spine to treat diseases. At first, he was not sure himself, just "trying it out," but after experiments, some patients were cured, and some patients' symptoms were alleviated. Soon, he became a good doctor praised by the working people.

Sun Huiqing is now seventy-four years old. After more than 30 years of continuous practice and research, his experience has become richer and more perfect. His specialty, this stimulating nerve therapy, has been recognized by the Ministry of Health as a treatment method that can stand alone.

Editor's Note:
After Sun Huiqing's stimulating nerve therapy was introduced twice by the Russian-language friendly newspaper, readers from China and the Soviet Union have requested to promote this treatment method. Now we have found the original manuscript of the article written by Comrade Ai Changqing for the Russian-language friendly newspaper and published it here as an introduction. (Attached picture)

    介绍孙惠卿的刺激神经疗法
    艾长青
    被孙惠卿治愈了多年高血压症的一位苏联专家谢·斯·吉谢辽夫写给孙惠卿的信中说：“您的光荣形象——孜孜不倦的科学工作者的形象，伟大中国人民的爱国的乐观的儿子的形象，将永远铭刻在我的心里”。
    孙惠卿治疗疾病的方法叫做刺激神经疗法，是用钢针七枚绑成圆柱形，刺在背脊骨两侧和患病部位的痛觉神经末梢。孙惠卿说：人体的一切器官和组织都是在中枢神经系统的领导指挥下发挥其功能并保持其完整性的。神经中枢的机能遭到任何损害或紊乱，便会引起其所支配的部位发生病变，造成疾病。因而，他主张治疗疾病必须首先调整整体的平衡同时照顾局部，而不仅仅是头痛医头，脚痛医脚。整体强了，局部的疾病也就自然解除。刺激神经疗法是通过刺痛的反射作用，激发神经兴奋，增强生理机能，调整交感神经、副交感神经的平衡和统一而消除疾病，复恢身体各部组织的正常发展。因为钢针刺激到广大神经末梢，就会激发起许多神经原（神经系统的功能单位）兴奋运动，交互反射，以发挥各器官各内脏的功能，增强抵抗能力，并通过中枢神经统一调整各部的功能。所以这种疗法的基本特点是以刺激的反射作用增强人体的抵抗能力，消除疾病。这种疗法的另一特点是简便易行。首先是技术简便；而且由于它是只刺皮肤，即便是初学的人，进行治疗时也决不会发生任何危险。因而许多病人也学会了治疗。其次是经济，只是七枚钢针和一些用来消毒的酒精就可以施行治疗。
    这种治疗方法的效果是很显著的。据孙惠卿刺激疗法治疗所小鹁鸽市门诊部去年秋季三个多月的统计，来他这里治疗的三百三十七人中96％都有疗效，肠胃病和支气管炎的疗效达98％到100％。南汉宸患高血压、眼溢血、神经衰弱和风湿性关节炎四种疾病，经过孙惠卿治疗已经全部痊愈。王尧青患关节炎，半身不遂，在床上躺了一年多，经孙惠卿治疗十余次就起床了，他的妻子田焕英因而感动的作了孙惠卿的学生。一位苏联专家患高血压多年，经孙惠卿治疗十多次就好了。儿童姚小燕患大脑炎，手脚僵硬，两眼发呆，经孙惠卿治疗一次后便减轻了症状，二次就好了。尤其值得重视的是许多奇异的疾病经过中、西医治疗无效，而在这里获得了显著的效果。患子宫癌已四期的闻梅君，经中央人民医院诊断，认为只有三个月生命了，经过孙惠卿治疗，现在已经活了二十个月，而且病势已经减轻。据医院后来的检查，她的病已退到第二期了。张南生的眼睛患青光眼，眼压六十度，经过孙惠卿萧爱成师徒前后七个月的治疗，眼压已由六十度减到二十二度，接近正常了。他的这个学生是一个军医院的副院长，他用这种方法治疗九十六个风湿性关节炎病人和八个高血压病人，效果也很好。这九十六个风湿性关节炎患者中，大多贫血，血沉速度快；睡眠不好，经过四星期的刺激神经治疗，体重都有了增加，身体恢复了正常。如患者吕金友，入院时红血球只有三百一十万，血色素为50％，血沉中等五一MM，经过四次治疗后红血球增加到三百五十万，血色素61％，血沉中等降为二十三MM，到第四星期结束已基本恢复正常，红血球增加到四百五十万，血色素增为71％，血沉中等降到九MM。八名高血压患者平均高压一百七十，低压一百四十五，一周后高压降为一百三十五，低压八十。三周后完全恢复正常。萧爱成还作了刺激神经疗法的动物试验。他用长针把一只狗的颈神经结刺伤，使狗的眼球充血，暂时失明。经过三十多次针刺，这只狗的双眼又复明了。这就充分说明了发动动物体内内部调整功能作用的巨大。他在试验中证明了刺激疗法的兴奋作用，也证明了刺激疗法的抑制作用。他曾以一只兔子作试验。在兔子耳朵上注射了2％2CC皮下注射（毛果香），兔子就大量分泌唾液，一分钟流唾液三十七滴，第二次进行同样的注射后施行了针刺，兔子的唾液分泌就减少为十一滴了。
    特别值得介绍的是孙惠卿诊断病症的方法。根据人体各器官的活动都是神经细胞所能支配的，而一切神经细胞都来自大脑和脊椎神经的原理，任何的病变都会引起脊椎骨的变位变形或疼痛。孙惠卿就是据此进行诊断的，他只要沿着脊椎骨从下而上一摸就可以查出神经活动功能失调的疾病所在以及轻重程度。这种诊断法的准确性，在有的场合甚至超过X光的透视。如有人过去患过肺病现已钙化，在医院经过多次透视才能检查出来，而孙惠卿却一次就检查出来了，所判断的位置也和透视完全相同。又如风湿性的关节病，因为患处的骨骼并未变形，是很难透视出来的，而用孙惠卿的透视法一摸却可以诊断出来。
    当孙惠卿四十岁的时候，他的儿子生病死去了，他便决心致力于医学。他回忆起幼年时代曾经看到农民用绳索抽打人体治疟疾和用刮拧皮肤方法治病，使他想到可以用刺痛来治疗疾病。于是，他开始了刺激神经疗法的研究。学习了现代生理学后，他试验刺激脊柱两侧皮肤上的神经末梢治病。起先，他自己也没有把握，只是“试试看”，但经过试验，有的病人被治好了，有的病人病状减轻了。不久，他就成为劳动人民所称道的良医了。
    孙惠卿现在已经七十四岁，经过三十多年不断的实践和研究，经验更加丰富和完善，他所擅长的这种刺激神经疗法，已被卫生部认为可以独成一体的治疗方法。
    编者注：
    孙惠卿医师的刺激神经疗法，经过俄文友好报两次介绍之后，中苏两国读者纷纷要求推广这个治疗方法。现在我们将艾长青同志为俄文友好报写的文章原稿找到，刊登在这里，作为介绍。（附图片）
