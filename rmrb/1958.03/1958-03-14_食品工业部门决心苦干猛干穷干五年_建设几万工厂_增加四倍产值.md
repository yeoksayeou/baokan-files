Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: The Chinese food industry will advance by leaps and bounds during the Second Five-Year Plan. According to preliminary calculations based on the opinions of various provinces (autonomous regions) and cities at the National Food Industry Conference, which closed on the 10th, the total output value of the food industry under the management of industrial departments nationwide will increase from 5 billion yuan to 25 billion yuan in five years, a development rate more than three and a half times faster than during the First Five-Year Plan. The development speed of major products such as oil, salt, sugar, wine, milk powder, canned food, and cigarettes will greatly exceed the level of the First Five-Year Plan. According to preliminary calculations, oil may increase from 1.45 million tons in 1957 to 6 million tons; salt may increase from 8.26 million tons to 20 million tons; sugar may increase from 850,000 tons to more than 6 million tons; and wine may increase from 730,000 tons to 2 million tons.

At this conference, representatives from many regions criticized the past conservative ideas that the development of the food industry lacked resources, technology, funds, equipment, and prospects, and put forward the slogan of "working hard, working vigorously, and working frugally." Some regions even proposed three "no's," namely, not asking the state for investment, not asking the state for technical cadres, and not asking the state for unified purchase of materials.

According to preliminary plans, tens of thousands of food processing plants will be built across the country in five years, with small and medium-sized plants accounting for the vast majority. Because the factories are small in scale, require less capital, and the technology is relatively simple, it is easy to leverage the strength of provinces, cities, counties, townships, and communes, as well as industry, agriculture, and commerce departments.

During the conference, Vice Chairman Zhu De attended and gave important instructions.

    食品工业部门决心苦干猛干穷干五年
    建设几万工厂  增加四倍产值
    据新华社12日讯  中国食品工业在第二个五年计划期间将大踏步前进。据10日闭幕的全国食品工业会议根据各省（自治区）市意见初步计算，五年内全国工业部门所管的食品工业总产值将由五十亿元增加到二百五十亿元，发展速度比第一个五年计划期间快三倍半以上。油、盐、糖、酒、乳粉、罐头、卷烟等主要产品的发展速度，都将大大超过第一个五年计划的水平。按照初步计算，油可能由1957年的一百四十五万吨增长到六百万吨；盐可能由八百二十六万吨增长到二千万吨；糖可能由八十五万吨增长到六百万吨以上；酒可能由七十三万吨增长到二百万吨。
    在这次会议中，许多地区的代表都批判了过去认为发展食品工业没资源、缺技术、少资金、无设备、没有前途等等保守想法，提出了“苦干、猛干、穷干”的口号。有的地区还提出了三不要，即不向国家要投资，不向国家要技术干部，不向国家要统购物资。
    据初步规划，全国五年中将建设几万个食品加工厂，其中，中小厂将占绝大多数。由于工厂规模小，所需资金少，技术比较单纯，就便于发挥省、市、县、乡、社各级和工、农、商各部门的力量。
    会议期间朱德副主席到会作了重要指示。
