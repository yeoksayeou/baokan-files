    Saying New Stories and Singing New Lyrics
    Performing Arts Research Association Proposes Great Leap Forward Initiative to National Performing Arts Workers

    Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: The Chinese Performing Arts Research Association held a symposium on the 8th and passed a proposal to national performing arts workers to strive for a Great Leap Forward in performing arts work.

    The proposal stated: All professional and amateur writers who are enthusiastic about performing arts creation, as well as artists with writing abilities, must rise up together and, using forms that are loved by the working people such as drum storytelling, storytelling, Qinshu ballad, Kuaishu comic talk, Pingtan ballad singing, Qingyin ballad, cross talk, Muyu ballad, dragon boat songs, and Haolaibao, create a large number of serious works that reflect real life and praise socialism.

    The proposal also put forward to national performing arts workers: Say more new stories, sing more new lyrics, and publicize new people, new events, and the new socialist face of our country to the broad masses of the people; do not tell poisonous old stories or old lyrics, so that these harmful weeds can be completely eradicated from the revolutionary garden of performing arts; bring performing arts to factories and rural areas, performing for workers and peasants on the one hand, and learning from workers and peasants on the other. The proposal called on national performing arts workers to bravely plunge into the torrent of the Great Leap Forward, so that the performing arts world would present a lively and prosperous new atmosphere in this unusual spring.

    More than 100 people attended the symposium, including directors, members, authors, researchers, and representatives of relevant departments of the Chinese Performing Arts Research Association in Beijing. Writers Lao She, Tian Han, Zhao Shuli, and others also proposed at the meeting that they must write performing arts works this year to support the work of performing arts artists in telling and singing new stories and lyrics with practical actions. Representatives from the Central People's Broadcasting Station Rap Group, the Beijing Performing Arts Troupe, the Temple Fair Performing Arts Group, the Xinyishe Performing Arts Troupe, and the Beijing Performing Arts Training Class also reported on their Great Leap Forward plans and mutual competition conditions at the meeting.

    说新书唱新词
    曲艺研究会向全国曲艺工作者提出大跃进倡议
    据新华社8日讯　中国曲艺研究会8日召开的座谈会，通过了一项向全国曲艺工作者提出争取曲艺工作大跃进的倡议。
    倡议书提出：凡是热心曲艺创作的专业和业余作者以及有写作能力的艺人，都要一致奋起地拿起笔来，用大鼓、说书、琴书、快书、评弹、清音、相声、木渔、龙舟、好来宝等劳动人民所喜闻乐见的形式，大量地认真地创作反映现实生活、歌颂社会主义的作品。
    倡议书还向全国曲艺工作者提出：多说新书，多唱新词，向广大人民宣传新人、新事和我国的社会主义新面貌；不说有毒害的旧书和旧词，使这些害人的毒草从革命的曲艺园地上铲除净尽；把曲艺送上工厂、农村，一面给工农演唱，一面向工农学习。倡议书号召全国曲艺工作者勇敢地投入大跃进的洪流，使曲艺界在这个不平常的春天呈现出一片活泼、繁荣的新气象。
    参加这次座谈会的有中国曲艺研究会在京理事、会员、作者、研究者和有关部门的代表一百多人。作家老舍、田汉、赵树理等也在会上提出他们今年一定要写曲艺作品，以实际行动支持曲艺艺人说唱新书词的工作。中央人民广播电台说唱团、北京市曲艺团、庙会曲艺组、新艺社曲艺团和北京市曲艺学习班等单位的代表还在会上报告了大跃进的计划和互相竞赛的条件。
