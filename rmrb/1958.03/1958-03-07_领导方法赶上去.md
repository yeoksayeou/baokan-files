    Leadership Methods Catch Up
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Chao
    A dramatically changing picture: XuShui county, which in the past suffered from drought, flood, and waterlogging almost every year, has seen its landscape completely transformed after a brief three-month winter battle by the county's farmers. On the dry, vast fields, over one hundred and twenty plain reservoirs, scattered like stars, have emerged; rows of white collective pigsties have appeared in villages and communes, and the number of pigs, previously mainly raised by individual households (37,500), has soared to 320,000, mainly raised by communes; the grain yield per mu target has been revised again and again, rising from 214 jin last year to 500 jin this year; a little-known county has jumped to become a banner for Hebei Province.

    The XuShui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party brilliantly organized this decisive battle, and its leadership methods have also undergone a comprehensive leap forward.
      Going to the Masses
        Finding Sparks
    Zhang Guozhong, the first secretary of the county party committee, and his colleagues, told the following stories:
    On the eve of the winter production upsurge, Zhang Guozhong went to Nan Zhangfeng Township to lead the autumn planting. This was a low-yield area, where grain yields per mu were only a few dozen jin in previous years. Zhang Guozhong discussed with township and commune cadres and the masses several measures to increase production: concentrated application of fertilizer, adding sand to alkaline land, promoting improved varieties, reasonable close planting, promoting winter irrigation, ensuring full seedlings, and preventing pests and diseases. So, how much could production be increased? Some cadres said: 130 jin. Zhang Guozhong said: Too little. But he himself was not sure. After talking with the masses, he thought 300 jin was no problem. This enlightened Zhang Guozhong: If low-yield areas can leap forward, why can't other areas leap forward? The key is to break the cadres' conservative thinking. How to break it? Rely on the masses. With excitement, he returned to the county and immediately convened a meeting of all township branch secretaries, proposing the slogan of large-scale high-yield and high-yield fields. Subsequently, during the winter production upsurge, he constantly and repeatedly calculated and added targets from the masses to the leaders, and from the leaders to the masses, until February 12th, when each township and commune recalculated the detailed accounts and increased the target to 500 jin.
    When construction of the county's first Shi Gezhuang plain reservoir began, the leadership was still planning: Since it is mainly commune-run, the state should still provide some money, so it was stipulated that each person would be given three fen for soup per day. Before the project had been underway for a few days, the masses refused to accept even the three fen. Originally, 12,000 people were mobilized to work, but more than 16,000 people came. The original plan was to complete the project in half a month, but it was completed in half the planned time. The completion of this reservoir led to the county party committee's blueprint for "scattered like stars," for a rapid, economical, and high-quality plain reservoir network, setting off a high tide of water conservancy construction.
    Dasi Gezhuang's Puhe No. 2 Cooperative is the first advanced cooperative in the county to change from household-based pig raising to cooperative-based pig raising. Moreover, cooperative pig raising reached 70% (as early as last year, cooperative pig raising in this cooperative had already reached over 30%). The county party committee decided to have all agricultural cooperatives in the county learn from Puhe No. 2 Cooperative and, before autumn this year, transition from household-based pig raising to cooperative-based pig raising (see February 27th edition of this newspaper, page 2, for details). This promoted a new high tide in pig raising for manure accumulation.
    In this way, they constantly went to the masses to find sparks and turned them into a prairie fire, which also burned away conservatism and routine. After the prairie fire, these exotic flowers and rare herbs sprouted on the land.

    The county party committee called these methods: resolutely relying on the masses, standing in front of the masses, and leading the masses forward.
    Learning While Doing, Applying as We Learn
    In three months, a series of new problems were placed before the county party committee, and the masses were advancing rapidly. What to do? Drill first, then do? Or do first, then drill? Neither would work! Couldn't keep up!

    Zhang Guozhong and his colleagues had to bite the bullet, learn while doing, apply as they learned, and catch up!

    The first plain reservoir was created in this way: The county party committee had to gain experience from this pilot project. However, not to mention experience, no one knew even the basics of dam foundation, level, slope, flow, etc. Wang Gengchen, the minister of rural work who was responsible for the pilot project, and his assistants, decided to be primary school students first, and asked the technical staff of the water conservancy bureau to be teachers. After two lessons, only half of the information went in and the other half slipped away. They stared blankly at the instruction manual. Then they went to the construction site for practice, turning the construction site into a school, and slowly figured out a little bit. By the time the reservoir was completed, the experience and knowledge were also in hand. Then, they used this experience and knowledge to teach the cadres and masses participating in the construction of the second, third, and nth reservoirs.

    Of course, this was just the beginning, and there were many technologies that needed to be studied. The county party committee made a decision that in the future, each leading cadre at the county and township levels must master one skill through experimental fields. Zhang Guozhong specialized in corn, Liu Yu (one of the secretaries) specialized in wheat, Li Huanzhang (the county head) specialized in tubers, and Yang Guohua (one of the secretaries) specialized in cotton. The same applied to township cadres and agricultural cooperative directors. Zhang Guozhong was even more enthusiastic. He also planned to study agricultural machinery, saying: It is possible that the county will initially achieve mechanization in the next year or two. If we can't operate the machines ourselves, how can we do it with just words!

    The county party committee also adopted the method of "whatever technical difficulties there are, we will run a training class for it," to impart the various scientific and technological knowledge that was urgently needed at the time. In three months, more than 4,000 technicians were trained, including more than 1,300 animal husbandry technicians, 280 forestry technicians, more than 780 agricultural technicians, more than 1,000 agricultural machinery technicians, and 550 cone well technicians. Technicians, instructors, and teaching materials were all "locally sourced." Most of the technicians were junior and senior primary school graduates selected by the agricultural cooperatives. The anti-epidemic personnel of the animal husbandry and veterinary stations, the technical personnel of the agricultural and forestry bureaus, the cadres of the commercial bureaus, and the drivers of the military units were hired to serve as instructors for various training classes, and most of them were issued graduation certificates upon completion of the training. In addition, the county party committee also convened relevant cadres in various townships to hold various professional meetings to impart technical knowledge on the spot.
      Strengthening the Front Line
        Twisting Into One Rope
    The prairie fire also burned away the conservatism and routine in the county's leadership style.

    The county party committee took drastic revolutionary measures: strengthening the front line and twisting everyone into one rope.

    The county party committee regarded the entire countryside as a battlefield, divided into two fronts: one was the agricultural production front, and the other was the animal husbandry (with pig raising as the focus) production front. Townships and cooperatives were the front lines. In the past year, 250 capable cadres from the county-level organs were successively transferred to the townships. Of the original 164 township cadres, all but 18 were transferred to the cooperatives, and the backbone of the townships and cooperatives were reviewed and adjusted. Now, there are an average of three to five secretaries in a township (all of whom were former district party secretaries and district heads). In this way, the fighting strength of the front line has been greatly strengthened, and an order can be issued, and a full-scale attack can be launched immediately.

    As for the county party committee, as the command headquarters, during the winter production upsurge, most of its members were also invested in the front line to supervise the battle. Only one secretary and one or two standing committee members were left to handle daily work and concurrently manage nearby townships and cooperatives. The commanders on the front line set up temporary command headquarters wherever they went. Many county party committee meetings were held on the mountains, at the reservoir construction sites, and in the townships, to deploy the county's combat operations on the spot. At the end of November last year, a county party committee meeting was held in Bei Gaoqiao Township. At that time, Zhang Guozhong was studying high-yield fields in Nan Liyuan Township and encountered some problems, so he convened several standing committee members working in nearby townships for a meeting, and decided: (1) Strive to have 60% of the plain reservoirs store water year-round to promote high yields; (2) Widely mobilize semi-able-bodied laborers to send manure to the fields to reduce the burden on the main labor force. Zhang Guozhong also brought this decision to Nan Liyuan Township, obtained the consent of the local cadres, and then deployed it to the whole county. In this way, the front-line combat operations were more agile.

    At the same time, the county party committee also organized the county-level organs into a unified logistics unit to support the front line. During the winter production upsurge, which centered on water conservancy and manure accumulation, under the unified leadership of the county party committee, the commercial bureau sent more than 280 cadres to purchase water conservancy construction materials, pig seedlings, seeds, and tree seedlings, etc.; the political and legal departments cracked and handled more than 100 cases, effectively打击[dǎ jī, to strike; to attack; to crack down on; a打击, especially in sports] the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, reactionaries, and bad elements, so that the front line had no worries; the faculty and staff of middle and primary schools actively wrote slogans, drew posters, and carried out recreational activities at the reservoir construction sites to inspire fighting spirit; the agricultural and forestry bureaus and other departments ran various training classes to deliver more than 4,000 animal husbandry, forestry, agricultural technology, machinery and other technical personnel to the front line. The health department vigorously carried out the Four Pests Elimination campaign, dispatched medical personnel to the reservoir construction sites to provide services, and helped agricultural cooperatives carry out pig epidemic prevention work. In this way, all departments, from top to bottom, were twisted into one rope, placed directly under the unified leadership of the county party committee, and worked together, side by side, around the current main attack direction.

    The county party committee also called these methods: highlighting key points, combining multiple aspects, dividing battle lines, and unified leadership.

    At the Hebei Provincial Four-Level Cadre Meeting, a responsible comrade used an appropriate analogy to summarize the improvement of the leadership style and leadership methods of the XuShui County Party Committee: In three months, the mold has come out. Although this mold is rough, it is relatively complete.

    领导方法赶上去
    本报记者　张潮
    一幅激变着的图景：过去几乎年年遭受旱涝洪三害轮番袭击的徐水县，经过全县农民短暂的冬季三个月的苦战，大地剧然易色。干燥的广阔的田野上，冒出了一百二十多座星罗棋布的平原水库；村村社社出现了一排排白色的集体猪圈，户养为主的三万七千五百头猪发展到社养为主的三十二万头猪；粮食亩产量指标改了又改，从去年的二百一十四斤上升到今年的五百斤；一个默默无闻的县份一跃而为河北省的旗帜。
    中共徐水县委出色地组织了这个决定性的战役，而且领导方法也有了全面的跃进。
      到群众中去
        找星星之火
    县委第一书记张国忠和他的伙伴们讲述过这样几件事情：
    在冬季生产高潮的前夕，张国忠到了南张丰乡领导秋种。这是一个低产区，往年粮食亩产量只有几十斤。张国忠同乡、社干部和群众琢磨出几条增产措施：集中施肥、碱地上砂、推广良种、合理密植、提倡冬灌、保证全苗、防治虫害。那么，能增产多少呢？有的干部说：一百三十斤。张国忠说：太少。但他自己也没把握，同群众一谈，三百斤没问题。这一下启发了张国忠：低产区能跃进，其他地区为什么不能跃进？关键在于打破干部的保守思想，怎么破？依靠群众来破。他怀着激动的心情回到县里，立即召开全县乡支部书记会议，提出大面积高额丰产口号。随后，在冬季生产高潮中，又从群众到领导，从领导到群众，不断地反复地算账加码，直到2月12日，经过各乡、社重新算了细账，把码加到了五百斤。
    开始兴建全县头一座史各庄平原水库的时候，领导上还在打算：既然社办为主，国家多少总得出些钱，于是规定每天发给每人三分钱的菜汤费，开工不几天，群众连这三分钱也不收了。原先动员一万二千人出工，却来了一万六千多人，原来计划半个月完工，结果提前了一半时间。这个水库的建成，引出了县委“星罗棋布”、多快好省的平原水库群的蓝图，掀起了水利建设高潮。
    大寺各庄瀑河二社是全县头一个把户养为主变为社养为主的养猪先进社。而且社养猪达到70％（早在去年，这个社的社养猪就已达到30％以上）。县委决定让全县农业社向瀑河二社看齐，到今年秋天以前，从户养为主过渡到社养为主（详见2月27日本报第二版新闻）。把养猪积肥推向新高潮。
    就是这样，他们不断地到群众中去找星星之火，使它变为燎原之火，也连带烧掉了保守和常规。燎原以后，大地才萌发了这些异花奇卉。
    县委把这些方法叫做：坚决依靠群众，站在群众前面，带领群众前进。
    边干边钻　边学边用
    三个月当中，一连串新问题摆到县委面前来，群众又在飞快前进，怎么办？先钻后干吗？或者干了再钻吗？都不行！跟不上！
    张国忠和他的伙伴们，只好硬着头皮边干边钻，边学边用，赶上去！
    头一座平原水库是这样产生的：县委必须从这个试点工作中取得验经。但是，别说经验，连坝基、水平、坡度、流量等等基础知识，谁也一窍不通。负责试点的是农村工作部长王庚晨，他和他的助手决心先当小学生，请水利局的技术人员当老师，上了两次课，脑子里还是进一半，溜一半，望着说明书发楞。跟着又到工地去实习，把工地变成了学校，才慢慢摸到了一点门道。待到这个水库完工了，经验和知识也拿到手了，于是，他们又拿这些经验和知识，去教参加第二个、第三个、第……个水库建设的干部和群众。
    当然，这还只是一个开端，需要去钻的技术还很多。县委作了决定，今后县、乡两级领导干部每人都要通过试验田钻一门。张国忠钻玉米，刘裕（书记之一）钻小麦，李焕章（县长）钻薯类，杨国华（书记之一）钻棉花。乡干部、农业社主任也是如此。张国忠的劲头更大，他还打算钻一钻农业机械，他说：明后年全县可能初步实现机械化，我们自己开不动机器，光凭嘴怎么能行呀！
    县委还采取了“什么技术困难就办什么训练班”的办法，传授当前迫切需要的各种科学技术知识。在三个月内，训练出四千多名技术员，其中有畜牧技术员一千三百多名，林业技术员二百八十名，农业技术员七百八十多名，农业机械技术员一千多名，锥井技术员五百五十名。技术员、教员和教材，都是“就地取材”。技术员大部分是由农业社选派来的初中、高小毕业生。聘请畜牧兽医站的防疫员、农林局技术人员、商业局干部和部队司机，分别担任各种训练班的教员，训练期满大部发给毕业证书。此外，县委还在各乡召集有关干部，举行各种专业会议，就地传授技术知识。
      加强第一线
        拧成一股绳
    燎原之火，也烧掉了县的领导作风上的保守和常规。
    县委采取了激烈的革命措施：加强第一线，拧成一股绳。
    县委把整个农村当作一个战场，划成两条战线，一条是农业生产战线，一条是畜牧（以养猪为重点）生产战线，乡、社就是第一线。过去一年中，先后抽调了县级机关二百五十名得力干部下放到乡，原有一百六十四名乡干部，除留下十八名外，全部下放到社，并且审查和调整了乡和社的骨干。现在，一个乡平均有三至五名书记（都是过去的区委书记、区长级干部）。这样，第一线的战斗力量大大加强了，一声令下，随即可以全线出击。
    作为司令部的县委，在冬季生产高潮中，也把大部成员投入第一线督战，只留一名书记和一、二名常委处理日常工作并兼管附近乡、社。在第一线上的司令员，到哪里就在哪里设立临时司令部，有许多县委会议就在山上，在水库工地，在乡上召开，就地部署全县作战行动。去年11月底，在北高桥乡开了一个县委会议。当时张国忠在南梨园乡研究丰产田，碰到了一些问题，就召集在附近乡工作的几位常委委员开了一个会，决定：（一）争取60％的平原水库常年蓄水，来促进丰产；（二）广泛发动半劳动力送粪上地，来减轻主要劳动力的负担。张国忠又把这个决定带到南梨园乡，征得当地干部同意后，再向全县布置。这样，第一线作战行动就更敏捷了。
    与此同时，县委又把县级各机关组成统一的后勤部队，来支援第一线。在以水利、积肥为中心的冬季生产高潮中，在县委统一领导下，商业局派出二百八十多名干部采购水利建设器材、猪秧、籽种和树秧等物资；政法部门破获、处理案件一百多起，有力地打击了地、富、反、坏的破坏活动，使第一线无后顾之忧；中、小学教职员积极写标语，画招贴画，在水库工地上开展文娱活动，鼓舞斗志；农林局等部门开办各种训练班，向第一线输送了四千多名畜牧、林业、农业技术、机械等技术人员。卫生部门大力开展除四害运动，派出医务人员到水库工地服务，帮助农业社开展猪的防疫工作。这样，就把各部门从上到下拧成了一股绳，直接置于县委统一领导之下，围绕当前主攻方向，协同作战，齐头并进。
    县委也把这些方法叫做：重点突出，多边结合，划分战线，统一领导。
    在河北省四级干部会议上，一位负责同志用了一个恰当的比喻，来概括徐水县委的领导作风和领导方法的改进：三个月，模子出来了。这个模子虽然粗糙，但它是比较完整的。
