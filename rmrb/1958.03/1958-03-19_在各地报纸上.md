On Newspapers Across the Country

    Learned the "Lessons" from Anhui
    Last winter and this spring, the people of Anhui not only achieved remarkable results in water conservancy construction, but also made great leaps forward in accumulating fertilizer, greening, eliminating the four pests, and other production activities. How did they lead the mass production movement, and how did they arrange the labor force? The people of Zhejiang were eager to know their experiences. Zhejiang Daily met the readers' needs and learned the "lessons" from Anhui. On the 16th, the newspaper published this "lesson" – "Labor Arrangement Issues in the High Tide of Agricultural Production," written by the Anhui Daily Editorial Department. This article specifically introduced the three main experiences of Anhui Province in advancing all aspects of work simultaneously during the high tide of production.

    The Bugle of Labor Revolution Sounds
    The revolution is constantly advancing, and new things are constantly emerging. The news of the great innovation of production tools reported on the entire front page of the March 16th Shanxi Daily is even more encouraging: 72 new types of agricultural tools in southern Shanxi meet the peasants, the turning of soil into land in Guangling has changed from shoulder carrying to cart pulling, and Xizhanggeng Township has basically achieved vehicle mechanization... These messages indicate that the bugle of the labor revolution has been widely sounded in the vast rural areas of the province. The four large photos arranged on the right side of the newspaper vividly introduce the various new agricultural tools created and reformed by the working people. The editorial entitled "Revolution on the Labor Front" stated that reforming tools is not only an important way to solve the current labor shortage, but also the fundamental way to develop productive forces.

    The Fire of "Double-Anti" Burns to Counties and Townships
    The fire of the "Double-Anti" movement in Jiangxi Province is burning fiercely. The March 15th Jiangxi Daily reported on the front page: The "Double-Anti" movement in the counties of the Nanchang Special District is developing rapidly and fiercely. More than 162,000 big-character posters have been posted in various counties. The issues involved in the big-character posters are not only broad but also important, encompassing everything from the central government to districts and townships, and launching fierce attacks on waste, conservatism, the three isms, and the "five airs." In this large movement, the work of supply and marketing cooperatives, grain bureaus, and purchasing stations, as well as the work style of county and township leading cadres, have been significantly improved.

    在各地报纸上
    从安徽取来了“经”
    去冬今春安徽人民不仅在水利建设方面取得了惊人的成绩，而且在积肥、绿化、除四害及其他生产活动方面样样跃进。他们是怎样领导大生产运动，怎样安排劳动力的呢？浙江的人们很希望知道他们的经验。浙江日报满足了读者的要求，从安徽取到了“经”。16日，报纸上公布了这个“经”——安徽日报编辑部写的“农业生产高潮中的劳动安排问题”。这篇文章具体地介绍了安徽省生产高潮中各项工作齐头并进的三条主要经验。
    劳动革命的号角响了
    革命在不断地前进着，新的东西在不断地涌现着。16日山西日报一版整版报道的生产工具大革新的消息更是振奋人心：晋南七十二种新农具和农民见面，广灵垫地变人担为车拉，西张耿乡基本实现车辆化……这些消息表明，劳动革命的号角，已经在全省广大农村普遍吹响了。报纸右面排列的四幅大照片，生动地介绍了劳动人民创造和改革的各种新农具。在题为“劳动战线上的革命”的社论里说，改革工具不仅是解决当前劳力不足的重要办法，而且是发展生产力的根本出路。
    双反之火烧到县乡
    江西省双反运动之火正在猛烧。15日江西日报一版上报道：南昌专区各县的双反运动，正在迅速、凶猛地发展，各县已贴出了十六万二千多张大字报。大字报涉及的问题，不但面广而且重要，上至中央、下至区乡，无所不包；对浪费、保守、三个主义及“五气”一齐进行猛攻。在这个大的运动中，供销社、粮食局、采购站的工作，以及县、乡领导干部的作风，均有了很显著的改进。
