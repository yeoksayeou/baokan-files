Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 23rd: Huarong County, Hunan Province, is promoting six innovation measures that can save six million workdays a year, basically overcoming the difficulty of insufficient rural labor.

Huarong County is located on the shores of Dongting Lake, with a small population and abundant land, making labor particularly tight. This problem is even more acute with the great leap forward in agricultural production this year. According to preliminary calculations, the amount of manual labor directly used in agricultural production this year will increase by ten million workdays compared to last year, with the county average equivalent to a full laborer working more than 450 labor days. The Huarong County Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted six major measures to solve this problem based on local conditions. First, vigorously build canal and reservoir projects in the lake area to expand gravity irrigation. This year, 299 projects such as canal control gates, sluice gates, and aqueducts have been built, which can expand the area of gravity irrigation to 400,000 mu, and it is estimated that 2.4 million workdays can be saved each year. Second, it is planned to promote 156 windmill waterwheels and 500 ox-drawn waterwheels this year, which can save 459,200 workdays. Third, expand water transportation. Agricultural cooperatives in various places are building 1,242 wooden sailboats with a load of more than 2 tons. It is estimated that the increase in waterway transportation can save 1.24 million workdays each year. Fourth, improve dry road traffic conditions and transportation tools. It is planned to build two large cart roads, three simple roads, and one hundred rural roads suitable for ox carts and horse carts this year. Promote 4,970 ox carts, horse carts, and handcarts, which can save 688,800 workdays each year. Fifth, open up fertilizer sources. In the past, due to insufficient fertilizer sources, a large number of laborers had to be sent to other provinces and counties to cut grass fertilizer every year, which was labor-intensive and yielded little fertilizer. This year, the vacant dikes will be used to plant Chinese peony as green manure, and the advanced fertilizer accumulation methods of "four diligence and eight haves" and the "fire-soil kiln" and other methods of fumigating soil fertilizer will be promoted, which can save 700,000 workdays. Sixth, increase the number of supply and marketing points or mobile teams in some remote villages, and increase the number of peddlers delivering goods to homes, saving farmers time from frequently going to the streets to buy things.

    哪里费工就在哪里想办法
    华容县六项措施，一年省工六百万个
    新华社长沙23日专电　湖南省华容县正推行六项革新措施，一年能省工六百万个，基本上能克服农村劳力不足的困难。
    华容县位于洞庭湖滨，人少地多，劳力特别紧张。今年农业生产大跃进，这个问题就更加尖锐了。据初步计算，今年直接用于农业生产的人工要比去年增加一千万个，全县平均折合一个全劳力要做四百五十个以上的劳动日。中共华容县委根据当地不同情况，采取六大措施来解决这个问题。第一是在湖乡大力建筑渠道拦蓄工程，扩大自流灌溉。今年已修渠道节制闸、斗门、渡槽等工程二百九十九个，可使自流灌溉面积扩大到四十万亩，预计每年可省工二百四十万个。第二，计划今年推广一百五十六台风力水车和五百台牛拉水车，可以省工四十五万九千二百个。第三，扩大水运。各地农业社正在修造载重二吨以上的木帆船一千二百四十二只。估计因增加水道运输每年可以省工一百二十四万个。第四，改进旱路交通条件和运输工具。计划今年修两条大车道、三条简易公路和一百条可行牛车、马车的乡村小道。推广牛车、马车和手推车四千九百七十辆，每年可省工六十八万八千个。第五，开辟肥源。过去因肥源不足，每年要派出大批劳力到外省外县去砍草肥，费工多积肥少，今年则利用废堤隙地种芍草作绿肥，推广“四勤八有”的积肥经验和“火土窑”等熏制土肥的先进积肥方法，能省工七十万个。第六，在一些偏僻乡村增设供销点或流动小组，并增设货郎担送货上门，节省农民经常上街买东西的时间。
