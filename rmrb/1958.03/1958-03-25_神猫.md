Yang Zicai is a worker at the Maoxin Flour Mill in Wuxi. He has persisted in catching rats for two years, day in and day out. Every evening, he always carries a basket full of rat traps, wires, and bait, going from door to door in the lanes around Wuqiao South to set up rat-catching tools. In the early morning, he goes to each house to collect dead rats and traps. Over the past two years, he has completely mastered the rats' movements. The masses praise him for catching rats "more reliably than a cat." People even say, "A quick cat can manage three households, but this 'Miracle Cat' can manage dozens of households." He has caught more than 7,000 rats in two years.

    “神猫”
    杨子才是无锡市茂新面粉厂的工人。他坚持捉老鼠，两年如一日。每天傍晚，他总挑着满篮鼠夹、铁丝、食饵到处奔走，在吴桥南堍一带里弄挨户布放捕鼠工具；清晨，他又到各家收死鼠和鼠夹。两年来，他完全掌握了老鼠的出没踪迹。群众赞扬他捉老鼠“比猫还稳”，人们还说：“快猫管三家，他这只‘神猫’却能管几十家。”他两年捕鼠七千多只。
