    Students and Workers
    The development of county-level industry has brought new changes in all aspects. The famous Qin County United Processing Factory recently signed a plan with Qin County No. 1 Middle School for mutual teaching and learning. The factory has decided to train a group of middle school students this year to become skilled technicians with general technical theory and operational proficiency. The plan is to train one hundred students, divided according to their own wishes and the factory's needs, into eight types of workers: lathe operators, fitters, blacksmiths, foundry workers, carpenters, electricians, printing workers, and small steel mill workers. The training period is half a year, without compensation. The school will also send teachers to the factory to give lectures to help workers improve their technical and cultural knowledge. The Shanxi Daily reported this news on page one on the 19th.
    Comparative Experiment Teams
    Besides the "experimental plots" cultivated by cadres, are there better experimental methods to promote technological reform? The New Hunan Daily reported on the 17th that the Hunan Provincial Party Committee's spring plowing inspection team discovered the method of comparative experiment teams in the Ziwu Port Agricultural Cooperative in Nan County. This method involves designating a production team in the cooperative as an experimental team and selecting fields with the same natural conditions to conduct comparative experiments on local seeds and improved varieties, sparse planting and dense planting, early planting and late planting, etc. The news said: This experiment has just begun, and it has already launched a fierce struggle against conservative thinking in technology.
    Holding On-Site Meetings in Rural Areas
    On the 15th and 16th, Song Li, Secretary of the CPC Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee and Mayor of Lushun-Dalian, and Li Nan, Deputy Mayor of Lushun-Dalian, led the heads and engineers of the Municipal Industrial Bureau, Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, Education Bureau, and Handicraft Management Bureau to Shui Shi Ying Township in Lushun and joined Secretary Liu of the Lushun Municipal Committee, cooperative cadres, and farmers to hold on-site meetings. This meeting was held to study and begin to resolve the issue of how urban departments can support the great leap forward in agricultural production. At the meeting, comrades from urban departments listened to the production plans and requests introduced by township and cooperative cadres. Song Li, Li Nan, and others immediately conducted research and proposed that each department should quickly study and handle them. Holding such meetings is a good way to solve urban-rural cooperation. The Lushun-Dalian Daily reported on the situation of this meeting on page one on the 19th.
    Every Township Will Have a Middle School
    Following the trial establishment of three private agricultural middle schools in Shuanglou Township, Hai'an County, and Shiqiao Township, Hanjiang County, Jiangsu, there is a high enthusiasm for running private agricultural middle schools in various parts of Jiangsu. The Xinhua Daily reported on the 19th that the Yangzhou Prefectural Committee decided to actively mobilize the masses to run 1,000 agricultural middle school classes this year, enrolling 60,000 students. Yancheng Prefecture plans to develop 208 private middle schools this year, enrolling 27,500 students, so that every township will have a middle school.
