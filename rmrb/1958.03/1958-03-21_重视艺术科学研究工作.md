    Emphasize Art and Science Research
    Lin Bi
    In the all-round Great Leap Forward of flourishing creation in the various art departments of drama, music, fine arts, dance, and folk art, it is very necessary for art and science research work to also make a Great Leap Forward; because scientific research is an important key to flourishing creation.
    Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" already incisively pointed out that China's literary and artistic undertakings must be improved on the basis of popularization, and popularized under the guidance of improvement. Without corresponding scientific research to guide today's artistic practice, it will be impossible to improve the quality of art, and the art cause will be difficult to further develop. Therefore, the ideological error of some art administrative leaders who do not value the leadership of research work is wrong. From the long-term perspective, it will hinder the vigorous development of the art cause.
    China is a country with a long history and excellent traditions. How to better inherit tradition and resolutely implement the Party's literary and artistic policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," the research work of art history materials is still very important; because socialist and national new literature and art must be built on the basis of tradition. However, art and science research, like other scientific research departments, should first serve the current Great Leap Forward in production; that is, serve the current creative practice, summarize the experience in this area, and then turn around to guide today's creative activities. Separated from today's artistic practice, art and science research work will hardly be able to exert its due combat role and practical significance.
    In the past few years, China's art and science research work has made some achievements, but it is still a weak link in China's scientific research work; in order to strengthen this team, it is hoped that the older generation of researchers will be more motivated and pass on their skills to the next generation; young art and science researchers should devote themselves wholeheartedly to this work. We believe that the flourishing development of artistic creation and the continuous improvement of the level of artistic theory will promote the early arrival of a high tide in China's cultural construction!

    重视艺术科学研究工作
    林碧
    在戏剧、音乐、美术、舞蹈、曲艺各个艺术部门繁荣创作的全面大跃进中，艺术科学研究工作跟着也来个大跃进，是非常必要的；因为，科学研究是繁荣创作的重要关键。
    毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，早已精辟地指出，我国的文艺事业必须在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及。如果没有相适应的科学研究来指导今天的艺术实践，就不可能提高艺术质量，艺术事业也就很难得到进一步的发展了。因此，目前有些艺术行政领导干部不重视研究工作的领导思想，是错误的。从长远的利益来看，是会妨碍艺术事业的蓬勃发展的。
    我国是一个有着悠久历史和优秀传统的国家，如何更好地继承传统，坚决贯彻党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的文艺方针，艺术史料的研究工作仍然是很重要的；因为社会主义的、民族的新文艺必须建筑在传统的基础上。但是，艺术科学研究和其他的科学研究部门一样，首先应该为当前的生产大跃进服务；也就是为目前的创作实践服务，总结这一方面的经验，然后回过头来指导今天的创作活动。脱离了今天的艺术实践，艺术科学研究工作就很难发挥它应有的战斗作用和现实意义。
    几年来，我国的艺术科学研究工作虽有了一定的成绩，但它仍是我国科学研究工作中薄弱的一环；为了壮大这一支队伍，希望老一辈的研究家们更加鼓起干劲，把自己的本领教给下一代；年轻的艺术科学研究工作者们更应该全心全意地投入到这一工作中来。我们相信，艺术创作的繁荣发展和艺术理论水平的不断提高，将促使我国文化建设高涨的早日到来！
