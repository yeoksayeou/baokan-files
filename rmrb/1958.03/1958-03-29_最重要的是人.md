    People are the Most Important Thing
    Yi Jian
    Can we run more industries faster, better, and more economically even with insufficient funds? Yes. One fundamental solution is to save. To save is to be diligent and thrifty.
    Whether we can run enterprises diligently and thriftily depends most importantly on people. This is the most valuable experience of the Baoding Machinery Factory.
    Look at this factory—the Party Secretary and Director of a medium-sized machinery factory with over a thousand employees, they rent dilapidated and small houses like the workers. The Party Secretary's family of eight is crowded into one and a half rooms, while the newly built dozens of dormitories are given to employees who lack housing. The Director's office is a converted old kitchen, and he uses old benches.
    Look at the workers of this factory. When the factory's buildings were facing difficulties, and someone suggested allocating a nearby building to the factory, they said: We don't need buildings, we can increase production in flat houses and open spaces. But when they were discussing this year's production plan, they resolved to increase the production of locomotive boilers from 500 to 4,000, and to triple the total output value.
    These are such respectable comrades. It is precisely because of such people full of revolutionary enthusiasm and possessing valuable qualities that this factory can fight hard for nine years as if it were one day, adhering to diligence and thrift in the most difficult times, and adhering to diligence and thrift even in better conditions. When spending money, they try every possible way to spend less or no money, and when producing, they try every possible way to leap forward again and again. The factory has rapidly developed from small to large under extremely simple conditions.
    Let the banner of the Baoding Machinery Factory attract thousands upon thousands of other factories to follow it and surpass it.

    最重要的是人
    宜俭
    资金不足，能不能把工业办得又多又快又好？能。根本的办法之一就是要省。省，就是勤俭。
    能不能勤俭办企业，最重要的是靠人。这是保定机械厂最宝贵的一条经验。
    请看这个厂——一个已有一千多名职工的中型机械厂的党委书记和厂长，他们与工人一样租住破旧矮小的民房，党委书记八口之家，挤在一间半屋子里，而新建的几十间宿舍，却让给缺房的职工住；厂长的办公室是一间旧厨房改成的，用的也是破旧的板凳。
    请看这个厂的工人，当着工厂的厂房发生困难，有人提出可以把附近的一座楼房拨给工厂使用的时候，他们却说：我们不需要楼房，在平房、露天地里一样能增产；而当着他们在讨论今年生产计划的时候，却又决心把生产锅驼机五百台增加到四千台，把总产值增加三翻。
    这是一些多么可尊敬的同志。正是因为有了这么一些充满革命热情、具备可贵品质的人，才能够使这个厂苦战九年如一日，在最困难的时候能坚持勤俭，在条件较好的时候也能坚持勤俭；在花钱的时候想尽一切办法少花钱不花钱，在生产的时候又想尽一切办法跃进再跃进。工厂在极端简陋的条件下，迅速地由小到大发展起来。
    让保定机械厂这一面旗帜，吸引着其它成千成万的工厂，跟上它，赶过它。
