Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 1st. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today saying that the Republic's government will extradite the two U.S. citizens and two citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany who arrived in northern Korea on the South Korean civil airliner that defected on February 16th, along with all their belongings, to representatives appointed by the U.S. government and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, respectively. The extradition can take place on any date, at Panmunjom, or at any location in Korea designated by the U.S. government and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The statement emphasized that the U.S. government's statement on this issue fabricated facts, calling the defection of the South Korean civil airliner to northern Korea a "hijacking," and falsely claiming that the Republic's government refused to allow those among the people who came to northern Korea on this aircraft who wished to return to do so. It also made other slanders and libels.

The statement pointed out that the people who defected to northern Korea are ordinary residents of South Korea who came to northern Korea to seek a way out of the oppression and dark rule of U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique.

The Republic's government firmly condemns the U.S. government's absurd fabrication that this matter is related to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or its relevant agencies. The Republic's government gives humane treatment to those who came to northern Korea on this aircraft, regardless of their nationality. The Republic's government has also stated that, upon request from the relevant authorities, it will send back those among them who wish to return. The U.S. government, disregarding the facts, is spreading rumors about this matter in order to achieve its ulterior motives and deceive world public opinion.

The statement said that the Republic's government believes that efforts should also be made to promptly return to their hometowns those Koreans who came to northern Korea on this aircraft and wish to return home. The Republic's government has advised the South Korean authorities to show due consideration for this. However, the Syngman Rhee clique not only does not respond but also engages in futile clamoring, which proves that the Syngman Rhee clique, in order to achieve its ulterior political motives, does not care about the wishes of those who wish to return home.

The statement said that the Republic's government condemns the Syngman Rhee clique's behavior and is prepared to hand over the Koreans who wish to return home to representatives of the South Korean Red Cross or representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross at any convenient date and location in Panmunjom or Korea.

    朝鲜政府宣布
    将引渡美国和西德四公民
    并斥责美国捏造事实诬蔑诽谤
    新华社平壤1日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省今天发表声明说，共和国政府将把乘坐2月16日起义的南朝鲜民航机来到朝鲜北部的美国公民二人和德意志联邦共和国公民二人和他们携带的所有物品，分别引渡给美国政府和德意志联邦共和国政府委任的代表。引渡可在任何日期、在板门店或美国政府和德意志联邦共和国政府指定的朝鲜任何地点进行。
    声明强调说，美国政府对这个问题发表的声明中捏造事实，把南朝鲜民航机起义来到朝鲜北部的行动说成是被“劫持”的，并诬称共和国政府拒绝乘坐这架飞机来到朝鲜北部的人员中希望回去的人们回去。另外还进行其他的诬蔑和诽谤。
    声明指明，起义来到朝鲜北部的人们，是反对美帝国主义和李承晚集团的压迫和黑暗统治，为了寻找生路而来到朝鲜北部的南朝鲜普通居民。
    共和国政府坚决斥责美国政府把这件事情说成同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府或者它的有关机关有关这一荒谬的捏造。对于乘这架飞机来到朝鲜北部的人们，共和国政府不论他们的国籍，一概给予他们人道的待遇。共和国政府并已表明，如有有关当局的请求，就把其中愿意回去的人们送回。美国政府不顾事实，就这件事情大肆造谣，是为了达到他们不可告人的目的和欺骗世界舆论。
    声明说，共和国政府认为，也应迅速设法使乘这架飞机来到朝鲜北部的朝鲜人中希望回家的人返回家乡。共和国政府曾经劝告南朝鲜当局对此表示应有的态度。但是，李承晚集团不仅不加以响应，却大肆进行无益的叫嚣，这证明李承晚集团为了达到它的不可告人的政治目的，不关心希望回家的人的愿望。
    声明说，共和国政府谴责李承晚集团的这种行为，并且准备把希望回家的朝鲜人在任何日期在板门店或朝鲜的任何方便的地点，引渡给南朝鲜红十字会的代表或者红十字国际委员会的代表。
