Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: The public memorial ceremony for Cheng Yanqiu, representative of the National People's Congress, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera, and famous Peking Opera performing artist, was held this morning at the Jiaxing Temple Funeral Home in Beijing. Guo Moruo presided over the ceremony.

Around the mourning hall were hundreds of wreaths presented by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Peng Dehuai, relevant departments, organizations, and individuals. The public memorial began. Zhang Geng, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera, then introduced Cheng Yanqiu's life. Zhang Geng said that Comrade Cheng Yanqiu came from an urban poor family and had great sympathy for the working people. He was upright, unyielding, and full of a sense of justice. In politics, he adhered to national integrity. After the fall of Beiping during the Anti-Japanese War, he refused to perform for the enemy and puppet regime and went to the countryside to farm. In singing, he was able to absorb various local opera tunes on the basis of the Peking Opera tradition, integrate them, and creatively develop them, giving his singing and performance a unique style and achieving considerable success in Peking Opera art. Zhang Geng said that Comrade Cheng Yanqiu supported the revolution and loved the Communist Party after liberation. In various political activities, he showed a high degree of political awareness, worked tirelessly and enthusiastically without conditions. In October 1957, Comrade Cheng Yanqiu was approved as a probationary member of the Communist Party of China. Based on Comrade Cheng Yanqiu's performance since joining the Party, he already possessed the qualifications of a full member of the Party. With the approval of the Communist Party Committee of the Ministry of Culture, Comrade Cheng Yanqiu is now posthumously recognized as a full member of the Communist Party of China.

Then Guo Moruo delivered a eulogy. He said that the death of Comrade Cheng Yanqiu is a great loss to the Chinese theater and even the art world. Comrade Cheng Yanqiu not only worked hard in art throughout his life, but also constantly strived for progress in personality. He became an independent school in theatrical art and displayed creative talent. In terms of personality, he went to the countryside to farm during the period of the enemy and puppet regime and became good friends with the common people. This is a concrete manifestation of the artist's unyielding character, indicating that he had common feelings and language with the people.

Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, represented Cheng Yanqiu's friends and introduced Cheng Yanqiu's moral character and his serious and conscientious attitude towards art.

Also present at the public memorial today were Vice Premiers of the State Council He Long and Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Zhang Xiruo, Cheng Yanqiu's friends Xu Guangping, Shao Lizi, Wang Weizhou, Gao Chongmin, Xiao Changhua, as well as representatives of various literary and art groups in Beijing, Cheng Yanqiu's students and family members, totaling more than 800 people.

Koichi Saiyonji, representative of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association who is in Beijing, and Masao Shimizu, head of the Japanese Matsuyama Ballet Troupe, Yuzo Hijikata, chief advisor, and Mikio Majima, secretary-general, also came to attend the public memorial.

After the public memorial, accompanied by Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, Tian Han, Zhang Geng, and Cheng Yanqiu's family and friends, the coffin was taken to the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery for burial. (Attached picture)

    首都各界公祭程砚秋
    他在政治上不断进步艺术上精益求精的精神值得学习
    据新华社13日讯  全国人民代表大会代表、中国戏曲研究院副院长、著名京剧表演艺术家程砚秋的公祭仪式今天上午在北京嘉兴寺殡仪馆举行。由郭沫若主祭。
    灵堂周围摆着周恩来总理，彭德怀副总理和各有关部门、团体、个人等赠献的几百个花圈。公祭开始。中国戏曲研究院副院长张庚接着介绍了程砚秋的生平。张庚说，程砚秋同志出身城市贫民家庭，对劳苦群众抱有极大同情，为人刚直不苟，富有正义感。在政治上坚持民族气节，抗日战争时期北平沦陷后，他不愿为敌伪演出，下乡务农。他在唱腔上能在京剧传统基础上吸收各种地方戏曲调，融会贯通，加以创造性的发展，使演唱及表演具有自己独特的风格，在京剧艺术上获得相当高的成就。张庚说，程砚秋同志在解放后拥护革命，爱戴共产党。在各种政治活动中，表现了高度的政治觉悟，不辞艰苦，无条件地热情工作。1957年10月程砚秋同志被批准为中国共产党预备党员。根据程砚秋同志入党以来的表现，已具备了一个正式党员的条件，现经中国共产党文化部委员会批准，追认程砚秋同志为中国共产党正式党员。
    接着郭沫若致悼词。他说，程砚秋同志的逝世是中国戏剧界以至艺术界的很大的损失。程砚秋同志一生不仅在艺术上努力精进，在人格上也不断努力精进。他在戏剧艺术上独立成家，发挥了创造性的才能；在人格方面，敌伪时期下乡务农，并且同老百姓交成好朋友，正是艺术家的不屈不挠的性格的具体表现，说明他和人民有着共同的感情和语言。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长陈叔通代表程砚秋生前友好，介绍了程砚秋的道德品质和对艺术的严肃认真态度。
    今天前来参加公祭的还有国务院副总理贺龙、陈毅，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒，文化部部长沈雁冰，对外文化联络委员会主任张奚若，程砚秋的生前友好许广平、邵力子、王维舟、高崇民、萧长华，以及北京各文艺团体的代表、程砚秋的学生和家属等共八百多人。
    正在北京的日中文化交流协会代表西园寺公一和日本松山芭蕾舞团团长清水正夫、总顾问土方与志、秘书长间岛三树夫也来参加了公祭。
    公祭结束以后，在郭沫若、陈叔通、田汉、张庚以及程砚秋家属亲友等陪送下，起灵去八宝山人民公墓安葬。（附图片）
