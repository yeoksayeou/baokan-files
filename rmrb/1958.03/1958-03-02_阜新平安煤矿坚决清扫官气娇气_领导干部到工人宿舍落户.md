Fuxin, March 1 (Liaoning Daily) -- This Spring Festival, an unprecedented joyous event occurred at the Ping'an Coal Mine in Fuxin: Several leading cadres moved their homes to the workers' residential area, shedding bureaucratic airs and affectations, and living, working, and standing on equal footing with the workers.

The decision for leading cadres of the Ping'an Mine to settle in the workers' residential area was made by the mine's Party Committee. In the past, some workers had pointed out that the Party Committee focused more on production and knew less about the workers' lives. The Party Committee had decided to visit workers' families every Saturday afternoon, but because the workers lived scattered, it was not possible to visit every family. Moreover, the occasional visit made the workers' families treat them as guests, which was very restrictive. The cadres' residences were also far from the workers' residential area, making it inconvenient to visit after work. This time, the leading cadres moved into the workers' dormitories, further strengthening the connection between the cadres and the masses.

The cadres' residences had heating and running water facilities. Moving into the workers' residences meant fetching water and using stoves for heating themselves, and also spending money to buy daily necessities such as water tanks and buckets. However, the leading cadres of this mine actively implemented the Party Committee's decision, insisting on not taking good houses and fewer rooms. After slightly repairing some dilapidated houses that were unoccupied, they moved in even before the wall plaster was dry. On February 12th, the Party Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Mine Director, Secretary of the Supervisory Committee, Director of the Organization Department of the Party Committee, Director of the Propaganda Department, and Chairman of the Trade Union, among others, moved into the workers' residences with their families. The Director of the Party Committee Office and the Party Branch Secretaries, who originally lived in the single cadres' building, also moved their luggage into the single workers' dormitories. There are three workers' residential areas in the entire mine, and now each residential area has a main responsible cadre of the mine living in it.

Before the Spring Festival, the newly moved-in leading cadres took the lead in cleaning the streets. Immediately, workers' family members, students, and workers on break all came out to participate in the cleaning work, making the residential area clean and tidy. During the festival, leading cadres and workers visited each other to offer New Year greetings, with a constant flow of people. Each cadre's home received more than a hundred guests. In just over ten days, each leading cadre made many friends, learned about the family situations of many workers, and also discovered some problems, which they plan to study and solve immediately.

    阜新平安煤矿坚决清扫官气娇气
    领导干部到工人宿舍落户
    本报讯　辽宁日报消息：今年春节，阜新平安煤矿出现了一件前所未有的喜事：几位领导干部把家搬到工人住宅区落户，打掉官气和娇气，和工人平起平坐、同生活、同劳动。
    平安矿的领导干部搬到工人住宅区落户，是由这个矿的党委决定的。过去有的工人曾提出：党委抓生产多，对工人生活了解少。党委曾决定每星期六下午访问工人家庭，但因工人住得分散，不能每一家都访问到；而且偶然去一次，工人家庭都以客人相待，很是拘束。干部住宅离工人住宅区又很远，下班后串门也不方便。这次，领导干部搬到工人宿舍中居住，进一步密切了干部和群众的联系。
    干部住宅有暖气和自来水设备，搬到工人住宅要自己担水吃和生炉子取暖，还要花钱添置一些水缸、水桶等日用家具。但是这个矿的领导干部积极执行了党委的决定，而且坚持不要好房子和少要房间，把一些没有人住的破旧房屋略加修理后，连墙皮都没干就搬进去了。2月12日那天，带家的党委书记、副书记、矿长、监委书记、党委组织部长、宣传部长和工会主席等都搬到了工人住宅；原来住在独身干部大楼的党委办公室主任和党总支书记等，也把行李搬到了独身工人宿舍。全矿共有三个工人住宅区，现在每个住宅区都住有矿的主要负责干部。
    春节前，新搬去的领导干部带头打扫街道。马上，工人家属、学生和歇班的工人们都跑出来参加打扫工作，把住宅区收拾得干干净净。节日到了，领导干部和工人们互相串门拜年，人来人往，应接不暇。每个干部家里都接待了一百多名客人。只有十来天，每个领导干部都交了很多朋友，知道了很多工人的家庭情况，也发现了一些问题，准备马上研究解决。
