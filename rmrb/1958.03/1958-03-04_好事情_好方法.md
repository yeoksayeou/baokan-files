    Good Deeds, Good Methods
    Tian Linmao
    Disaster relief can be said to be a good thing. The reactionary rulers of past dynasties not only did not provide disaster relief but also tried every possible means to plunder the people and create famine. Our people's government has specially established relief agencies, distributing relief funds every year, and organizing disaster victims to help themselves through production, enabling them to safely overcome disasters. This is certainly a good thing.
    However, disaster relief is only a temporary and passive measure and cannot fundamentally change the poverty situation in disaster areas. To fundamentally eliminate poverty and make people's lives prosperous, we must take active measures to eliminate natural disasters and develop production on a large scale. The facts in Yuanyang County, Henan Province, profoundly illustrate this truth. Yuanyang County is located in the old course of the Yellow River and suffers from disasters every year. The local government regards disaster relief as its central task every year. However, disaster strikes every year despite the continuous relief efforts. Over the past few years, more than 16 million yuan in relief funds and loans have been issued, yet it is still a severely affected county. This year, the old methods were changed, and the county's farmers were mobilized to carry out large-scale water conservancy projects. The government invested only 920,000 yuan, which can transform most of the saline-alkali land into good rice paddies, turning the historically disaster-stricken county into a surplus grain county. This initiative, which benefits both the local farmers and the entire country, marks the leap of Yuanyang County's work from passively responding to disasters to actively eliminating disasters and mastering its own destiny. An infinitely bright and happy future has already unfolded before the people of Yuanyang County.
    Conservative thinkers always believe that disaster areas can only focus on disaster relief and lack the strength to carry out basic construction, and they also believe that the masses in disaster areas cannot be interested in basic construction. People with such views really do not understand the psychology of the masses. In fact, the people in disaster areas are unwilling to live on relief grain forever, and they have a strong desire to completely eliminate disasters and develop production. As soon as the Yuanyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call for water conservancy construction, the broad masses responded enthusiastically, taking out their only savings and waste materials at home to invest. Doesn't this reflect the strong desire of the masses?
    Of course, the masses' understanding will not be completely consistent at first. Some people will have various different views and opinions, and their strength cannot be concentrated or expressed. At this time, their strength is potential and dispersed. However, after the leaders mobilize them well and make the masses recognize the correct path, the situation will completely change. Jiaocheng County, Shanxi Province, has such an example: Xiaozhuangtou Village in Yuanxiang Township suffered a flood in 1955. At that time, some people advocated concentrating their efforts on engaging in sideline occupations and seizing cash to overcome the famine. However, after organization and mobilization, everyone turned to focus on large-scale basic construction. In the past two years, 78% of the village's area has been brought under control of soil erosion, and the grain yield per mu has now reached more than 100 jin, 30 to 40 jin higher than the surrounding villages. After the disaster in Wawugou Township, the leadership did not mobilize the masses to carry out disaster relief work, but only carried out simple disaster relief, resulting in more and more serious soil erosion year by year. Last year, the yield per mu dropped from 91 jin in 1955 to 68 jin. Educating farmers not to only care about immediate interests but to focus on long-term interests, and at the same time actively organizing farmers to fight for the eradication of disasters, is the task of the Party organizations in disaster areas.

    好事情　好方法

    救灾可以说是一件好事。历代的反动统治者不仅不救灾，还千方百计掠夺人民，制造灾荒。我们的人民政府专门设立救济机构，年年发放救济款，组织灾民生产自救，使他们安渡灾荒，这当然是好事。
    但是，救灾只是临时性的消极的措施，并不能从根本上改变灾区的贫困状况。要从根本上消灭贫困，使人民生活富裕起来，就必须采取积极的措施来消除自然灾害，大规模地发展生产。河南省原阳县的事实，深刻地说明了这一真理。原阳县地处黄河故道，年年受灾，当地政府每年都把救灾作为中心工作。然而年年救灾，年年仍然有灾。几年来发放了救济款和贷款一千六百多万元，现在仍然是个重灾县。今年改变了过去的老办法，发动全县农民群众大兴水利，政府只投资九十二万元，便可把大部分盐碱洼地改变成稻米良田，使历史上的重灾县变成余粮县。这个既有利于当地农民、又有利于整个国家的创举，标志着原阳县的工作从被动地应付灾荒的阶段跃进到了主动地消灭灾荒、掌握自己命运的阶段。无限光明幸福的前途，已经展现在原阳县人民的面前。
    思想保守的人总以为灾区只能以救灾渡荒为主，没有力量进行基本建设，并且认为灾区群众不可能对基本建设发生兴趣。抱着这样见解的人实在是太不了解群众的心理了。实际上灾区人民并不愿意永远吃救济粮，他们有强烈的彻底消灭灾荒发展生产的愿望。中共原阳县委关于兴修水利的号召刚一发出，广大群众便热烈响应，把自己家中仅有的积蓄和废物废料都拿出来投资，这不正是反映了群众的这种强烈的愿望吗？
    当然群众的认识在最初不会是完全一致的，有一些人会有各种不同的看法和主张，力量集中不起来，表现不出来。这时候他们的力量是潜在的、分散的。可是在领导者加以很好的发动、使群众认清正确的道路之后，形势就会完全改变。山西交城县就有这样的例子：原相乡小庄头村1955年遭了水灾，当时有些人便主张集中力量出外搞副业，抓现钱渡荒。但是后来经过组织发动，大家就转而以主要力量大搞基本建设。两年来全村有78％的面积控制了水土流失，现在粮食亩产量已经达到一百多斤，高出周围村庄三四十斤。而瓦屋沟乡受灾后，领导上没有发动群众进行灭灾工作，只是单纯救灾渡荒，结果是水土流失一年比一年厉害，去年的亩产量已由1955年的九十一斤降到六十八斤。教育农民不要只顾眼前利益，而从长远利益着眼，同时积极组织农民为根除灾荒而奋斗，这就是灾区党组织的任务。
