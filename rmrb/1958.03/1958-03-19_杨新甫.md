    Yang Xinfu
    Our Correspondent Huang Yubai
    In Yueshan Township, Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, there is a mountain called Chenqiang Dashan. The farmers living in this large mountainous area always speak highly of Yang Xinfu. They say, "It was him who brought us several gods of wealth. Whoever comes to this distribution store to do business never forgets Director Yang."
    Yang Xinfu is the director of the supply and marketing cooperative in this township. He was sent down to this distribution store last spring. He had always lived in the plains, but he was not intimidated by the difficulties of mountain life. The first thing he did when he came to the mountain was to conduct interviews and discussions. He visited more than 20 farming households, eating, living, and working with the farmers to understand the characteristics and produce of the mountainous area and the living habits of the mountain people. In the past, some people described the mountainous area as a poor and harsh place, but this is not true. The mountainous area is rich in mountain products and local specialties, including precious medicinal materials, hides, wild vegetable oilseeds, fibers, starches, various non-staple foods, and thousands upon thousands of small local specialties. Whether on the mountain or at its foot, in front of the mountain or behind it, anything from there is valuable when brought to the plains. Procuring these products diligently can not only supply raw materials for industry and handicrafts and meet export needs, but also greatly encourage the production enthusiasm of mountain farmers and increase the income of agricultural cooperatives. The current problem is that these treasures are being wasted and buried. Yang Xinfu deeply realized the importance of the higher-level instructions to "concentrate major efforts on procuring agricultural and sideline products well, which is an important aspect of the supply and marketing cooperative's support for agricultural production and also the long-term central task of the supply and marketing cooperative." He was determined to take on the main task of developing the mountain economy.
    There are many herbs on Chenqiang Dashan. There are four herbal medicine farmers in the township who recognize more than 100 kinds of medicine. Yang Xinfu pondered day and night, wanting to teach the masses how to dig for medicine. He first consulted Chen Shengui, an herbal medicine farmer. Old Chen has been digging for medicine for three generations and has more than 50 years of experience. He is very honest, but on this point, he is very conservative. One morning, Yang Xinfu dug soil with Old Chen all the way, but whenever he mentioned teaching the masses how to dig for medicine, Old Chen would not say a word. Later, after finally becoming good friends, Old Chen agreed to take him up the mountain to dig for medicine, but when he ran to Old Chen's house early in the morning, Old Chen had already gone up the mountain alone. This was arranged twice, and both times he was disappointed. Yang Xinfu turned around and looked for the second herbal medicine farmer, Yang Taolin. Old Yang also agreed to go up the mountain, but the next morning he pretended to be sick and stayed in bed, so he didn't go again. Yang Xinfu was not discouraged. He also found Wen Qiusheng, an old herbal medicine farmer from Yiyang County who came to the local area to sell medicine, and formally became his apprentice. Wen Qiusheng was moved by Yang Xinfu's spirit and enthusiastically took Yang Xinfu up the mountain in the heavy rain. In one day, they dug up 47 kinds of herbs, carrying more than 100 jin back, including the mud.
    Once the medicine was dug up, things became easier. Yang Xinfu planted all 40-odd kinds of medicine in flowerpots, wrote the names and properties of the medicine, and displayed them in front of the supply and marketing store. On one side, he posted the purchase price, and on the other side, he organized the masses to visit and set up a special person to explain to the masses. From April to June, the exhibition lasted for more than two months. As a result, purchasing mountain medicine became a very happy event for the mountain farmers. People who had never recognized treasures now recognized treasures. One day, Jiang Haishan, a poor peasant member of the Yueshan Cooperative, came to the store to visit and saw a kind of "He Shou Wu" (Polygonum multiflorum) that seemed very familiar. He immediately ran to the wasteland behind his house and pulled some seedlings to compare them. When he heard that this was a useful medicine, he was overjoyed and mobilized his wife to clear the wasteland in one day, collecting a full 32 jin of dried "He Shou Wu," which sold for six yuan and forty cents. Because he cleared this wasteland, the cooperative also gave him seven work points. In order to specifically help households in difficulty overcome their difficulties, Yang Xinfu also personally led Yan Chuntao up the mountain during the slack season, teaching him how to dig for mountain medicine. By November, Yan Chuntao's income from digging for medicine had reached 65 yuan, solving his livelihood difficulties.
    The masses knew how to dig for medicine, but they didn't know how to process it. At the beginning, many of the medicines purchased were often defective, and some were even unusable. Yang Xinfu also learned the preliminary methods of processing medicine from the herbal medicine farmers and specially invited the herbal medicine farmers to the distribution store to give technical lessons to all the purchasing cadres in the sales department, so that everyone learned the preliminary processing methods. Through them, they were then introduced to the masses, so that more than 80% of the medicines purchased were first-class products.
    In order to propagate mountain medicine and expand the supply of goods, Yang Xinfu further studied how to cultivate mountain medicine at home, turning wild plants into domesticated ones. After two experimental failures, he finally managed to keep these 47 kinds of relatively valuable medicines alive. From that time on, Yang Xinfu established a mountain medicine experimental field in his distribution store. From the first to the third quarter of last year, this distribution store purchased various mountain medicines worth 8,944 yuan, increasing a huge income for the mountain farmers.
    Digging for mountain medicine is the beginning of Yang Xinfu's development of new varieties, and he has more plans behind him. He thought of papermaking. Chenqiang Dashan originally had some paper mills, which used the abundant bamboo on the mountain to make paper. Yang Xinfu thought: Bamboo can be used to make paper, so why can't bamboo shells be used to make paper? Bamboo is precious after all. If a substitute can be found, wouldn't that create another fortune for the country and the mountain farmers? He visited Liu Zhiguan, an experienced person, and learned that bamboo shells can also be used to make paper. Yang Xinfu signed a trial-making contract with the Yueshan Cooperative and invited Liu Zhiguan to teach them, and as a result, they made the first batch of paper using bamboo shells as raw materials. Now many agricultural cooperatives in this township have started paper mills. By November, the whole township had produced 235 dan of paper, increasing the farmers' income by 235 yuan, and also saving a large number of bamboos that could be transported out.
    Once, Yang Xinfu carried a peddler's load to the Banlu Agricultural Cooperative under this township to promote sales and saw a kind of wild vegetable growing very well by the roadside. The masses said that this was Niu Baihe (wild lily). Old Yang pulled out a clump to look at it. The tubers were very large and sticky. He ground it with water, and a layer of white powder accumulated at the bottom of the bowl. He dug ten jin in one breath to do experiments. Every 100 jin could produce 36 jin of starch. After sending the sample to the Provincial Department of Health for inspection, the reply was that it was the same as real lily powder. The County Cooperative also said that it could organize the masses to process it, and the purchase price was 46 yuan per 100 jin. Yang Xinfu immediately posted the purchase price again.
    Another time, Yang Xinfu put down his peddler's load and was resting by the mountain when he saw that many wild miscellaneous trees on the mountain had borne seeds. He thought: Generally, tung and tea seeds can be used to extract oil. Can these tung seeds be used to extract oil? He picked some "Jiguanxiang" (cockscomb fragrant) seeds and spread them on paper. When he pressed them with his thumb, the paper became stained, which proved that there was oil in it. But how to get more seeds to extract oil? Rural large oil presses require hundreds of jin to press. He thought about it for half the night and took out his 14 yuan of living expenses to ask a carpenter to make a small oil press that could press 4 liang to 10 jin each time. The result of trial pressing with Jiguanxiang seeds was that every 100 jin could produce 30 jin of oil. He quickly sent this sample to the Provincial Grain Company for appraisal.
    Yang Xinfu's experimental enthusiasm is very high. He once tried to use corn stalks to extract sugar, and every 100 jin could produce 7 jin of sugar. In order to prove whether a kind of starch could be eaten, he once personally tasted "Ludoushen" (green bean ginseng). He is still collecting many kinds of spice seeds and plans to make a simple distiller to see if he can distill spices. This year, this supply and marketing store also plans to introduce a batch of high-quality varieties of bees, sugar cane, and tea from the outside to promote them on Chenqiang Dashan, in order to further develop the sideline production of this mountainous area.
    Yang Xinfu also encountered some obstacles in his work. When he first started to explore new varieties, the County Cooperative's Purchasing Section and the District Cooperative's Management Department criticized him, asking him to work on some ready-made things and not to take those risks. When a few farmers initially didn't understand him, they saw him carrying a hoe and a knife, running around the mountains, and planting mountain medicine in flowerpots, and they laughed at him as a "madman." But Yang Xinfu had a very good method, which was to consult with the Party Committee more and consult with the masses more. In this way, he overcame the difficulties. He said, "If we in this line of work only want to wait for goods to come to our door and wait for customers to enter the store, and do not explore the sources of goods in the mountainous areas, the mountainous areas will never be developed."

    杨新甫

    湖南宁乡县月山乡有一座城墙大山，住在这个大山区的农民，一提起杨新甫总是赞不绝口。他们说：“就是他，给我们送来几个财神。谁上这个分销店做买卖，都忘不了这位杨主任。”
    杨新甫是这个乡的供销社主任。他是去年春天下放到这个分销店来的。他一向在平原生活，但他并没有被山区生活上的困难所吓退。他上山的头一件事，就是进行访问座谈。他访问了二十多户农民，与农民同吃同住同劳动，了解了山区的特点、出产和山区人民的生活习惯。过去曾经有人形容山区是穷山恶水，实际并不然。山区多的是山货土产，有珍贵的药材、皮张、野生植物油籽、纤维、淀粉、各种副食品和千千万万的小土特产品。山上山下，山前山后，那一样东西只要拿到平川来就很值钱。把这些产品认真地采购上来，不但可以供应工业、手工业原料和出口的需要，同时还可以大大地鼓舞山区农民的生产积极性，增加农业社的收入。现在的问题是物弃于地，埋没了这些财宝。杨新甫深切地体会到了上级指示的“集中主要力量搞好农副产品采购，是供销社支持农业生产的一个重要方面，也是供销社今后长期的中心任务”，他决心担负起开发山区经济的主要任务。
    城墙大山的草药很多，全乡有四个药农，认得一百多种药。杨新甫日夜琢磨着想把挖药的办法教给群众。他首先请教一个药农陈胜桂。老陈是三代挖药的，已经有五十多年的挖药经验，为人很老实，可就在这点上保守得很。有天早晨，杨新甫跟老陈一路挖土，只要一提到教群众挖药这回事，老陈就不啃声。后来，总算交好了朋友，老陈也答应带他上山去挖药了，可是一早跑到老陈家去时，老陈却一个人上山去了。这样约了两次，两次都扑了空。杨新甫回头又找第二个药农杨陶林。老杨也答应上山去了，可是第二天清早却装病睡在床上，结果又没去成。杨新甫没有灰心，他另外又找了从益阳县到本地来卖药的老药农文求生，正正式式地跟他拜了师傅。文求生为杨新甫这种精神感动了，热忱地带着杨新甫冒着大雨上山，一天就挖到四十七种草药，连泥巴担回了一百多斤。
    挖到了药，事情就好办了。杨新甫把这四十多种药全栽在花盆里，写上药名性能，陈列在供销店门前，一面挂出牌价收购，一面分头组织群众参观，并设专人给群众讲解。从4月到6月，一直展览了两个多月。这一来，收购山药便成了山区农民很大的喜讯，从来不识宝的人现在识宝了。有一天，月山社贫农社员江海山到店里来参观，看到一种“首乌”，好像很熟悉，马上跑到他家后山那块荒坪上扯了些苗来对着看。当他听说这就是一种有用的药时，可乐坏了，回去动员他老婆一天就开出了这块荒坪，足足收到三十二斤干的“首乌”，卖得药钱六元四角。因为他开出了这块荒坪，社里还给评了七工分。为了具体帮助困难户解除困难，杨新甫还利用农闲亲自带领严春陶上山，教他学会挖山药。到11月，严春陶挖药收入已达六十五元，解决了生活上的困难。
    群众会挖药了，可是还不会制。开始收购到手的药常有许多次品，甚至有的不能用。杨新甫又向药农学习初步的制药方法，还特地请了药农到分销店来给门市部的全体收购干部上技术课，使大家都学会了初步加工办法。通过他们再向群众介绍，这样收购得来的药80％以上都是甲等货了。
    为了繁殖山药，扩大货源，杨新甫又进一步学习如何把山药进行家培，变野生为家生。经过两次试验失败，最后终于把这四十七种比较贵重的药栽活了。从这个时候起，杨新甫就在自己分销店里建立了山药试验田。这个分销店去年一至三季度收购各种山药八千九百四十四元，为山区农民增加了一笔巨大的收入。
    挖掘山药是杨新甫开发新品种的开端，他还有更多的打算在后面。他想到了造纸。城墙大山原来就有一部分纸槽的，那是利用山上富产的竹子造纸。杨新甫想：竹子可以造纸，竹壳又为什么不能造纸呢？竹子究竟是宝贵的，如果能找出代用品来，那不是又给国家和山区农民创造了一笔财富？他访问了一个有经验的刘志倌，知道竹壳也能造纸。杨新甫跟月山社订了试造合同，请刘志倌来教，结果造出了第一批用竹壳作原料的纸。现在这个乡许多农业社都搞起了纸坊。到11月，全乡已经制出二百三十五石纸，给农民增加了二百三十五元收入，还节省了大批竹子可以外运。
    有一回，杨新甫担上货郎担到这个乡所属的板路农业社去推销，看见路边上有一种长得很好的野菜。群众说这是牛百合（野百合），老杨扯了一蔸出来看，块根很大，有粘性，把它用水磨碎，碗底下就积了一层白粉。他一气就挖了十斤回来做试验，每百斤可出三十六斤淀粉。把样品送省卫生厅检验以后，答复说跟真的百合粉一样。县社也说可以组织群众加工，收购价每百斤四十六元。杨新甫马上又把收购牌价挂出去了。
    还有一回，杨新甫放下货郎担，正在山边停歇，看见山上很多野生杂树都结了籽。他想：一般桐茶籽都是可以榨油的，这些桐籽可不可以榨油呢？他随手摘了一些“鸡冠香”籽摊在纸上，用大指甲一压，纸就渍了一块，肯定这里面有油。但是怎么多弄点籽来榨油呢？农村大油榨是要上百斤才榨的，他想了半宿，拿出自己的十四元多钱生活费，请木匠制了一个小油榨，每次可以榨四两到十斤。用鸡冠香籽试榨的结果，每百斤能出三十斤油。他把这个样品又很快地送到省粮食公司去鉴定了。
    杨新甫的试验热忱是很高的。他曾经试着用玉米杆榨糖，每百斤可出糖七斤。为了证明一种淀粉能不能吃，他曾经亲自尝过“绿豆参”。他现在还收集着许多种香料籽，打算再做一架简单的蒸溜器，看看是不是能蒸出香料来。今年，这个供销店还计划从外边引进一批优良品种的蜜蜂、甘蔗和茶叶，到城墙大山上来推广，以便进一步发展这个山区的副业生产。
    杨新甫在工作中也遇到过一些阻碍。开始挖掘新品种的时候，县社采购科、区社经理部都批评过他，要他搞些现成的，不必去担那些风险。有少数农民起初不了解他的时候，看见他带着一把锄头、一把刀满山去串，还拿上花钵子种山药，还笑他是“疯子”。可是杨新甫有个很好的办法，就是多和党委商量，多和群众商量。这样他就克服了困难。他说：“搞我们这行的，如果只想等货上门，等客进店，不去挖掘山区货源，山区就一辈子也开发不出来。”（附图片）
