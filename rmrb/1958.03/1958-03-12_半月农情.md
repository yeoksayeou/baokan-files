Half-Month Agricultural Situation
“Rain Water” (February 19th) – “Awakening of Insects” (March 6th)

Since last winter and this spring, there has been little rain and snow in many areas of northern China. Spring droughts have emerged in parts or most of Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hebei and other provinces. According to a survey in Shandong Province, about 60% of the province's 75 million mu of spring fields have poor soil moisture. In the half-month from "Rain Water" to "Awakening of Insects," these areas have devoted some effort to harrowing the land to preserve soil moisture and spring irrigation and other drought prevention work, and have achieved certain results. According to statistics from 43 counties in the four districts of Liaocheng, Huimin, Tai'an, and Laiyang in Shandong, by February 25, a total of more than 10 million mu of spring fields had been harrowed and more than 2 million mu of spring fields had been irrigated. In order to summarize the experience of drought prevention and resistance, Shandong Agricultural Science Research and other departments put forward drought prevention and moisture preservation methods through seminars. Farmers in Dingxi Prefecture, Gansu Province, have summarized 16 kinds of drought-resistant sowing methods. In Jingyuan, Huining, Longxi, Tongwei, Jingtai, Gaolan and other counties, six to seven hundred thousand mu of land can basically be sown completely.

Southern regions are also combining the construction of water conservancy projects to store and conserve water during this period.

During this stage, wheat in some provinces in the Yangtze River Basin is heading, and rapeseed is beginning to bolt and bloom; wheat fields in northern regions are also beginning to turn green. In order to strive for a bumper harvest this summer, many areas continue to carry out activities such as frost prevention, topdressing, and watering. Farmers in wheat-producing areas are full of confidence in winning a bumper harvest of summer crops. Twenty-three townships in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, put forward the slogan "Three Wheats Catching up with Rice," guaranteeing that the unit yield of three wheats will reach 500 jin this year.

Before "Awakening of Insects," cold air moved from north to south. The vast number of agricultural cooperative members in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui and other provinces made preparations for cold resistance and frost prevention before the arrival of the cold wave, and immediately rescued the frozen crops after the cold wave passed. This cold wave did not cause much damage to summer crops in southern regions.

Winter crops in some areas south of the Five Ridges are generally growing well. During this period, wheat in Guangdong Province has already headed and formed grains; rapeseed, peas, and broad beans are full of pods; and the sweet potato and potato tubers are also very large. Agricultural cooperatives in these areas are carrying out late-stage field management.

Most provinces in the Yangtze River Basin, following areas south of the Five Ridges and other regions, will also begin to cultivate rice seedling fields. Hunan Province is mobilizing the masses to do a good job in disinfecting rice seeds to prevent the spread of diseases. In the Huaibei area of Anhui, more than 3 million mu of paddy field ridges have been built, and more than 200,000 mu of seedling fields have been prepared, making specific preparations for planting early rice.

Sweet potato seedling cultivation has also begun in many areas. Judging from some situations, most agricultural cooperatives have started this agricultural activity half a month to twenty days earlier this year than last year.

    半月农情
    “雨水”（2月19日）——“惊蛰”（3月6日）
    去冬今春北方许多地区雨雪稀少。河南、山东、山西、甘肃、陕西、河北等省部分地区或大部地区的春旱已经露头。据山东省调查，全省七千五百万亩春田中，约有60％墒情不好。这些地区在“雨水”到“惊蛰”这半个月里，都付出一定力量进行耙地保墒和春灌等防旱工作，并取得一定的成绩。据山东聊城、惠民、泰安、莱阳四个专区的四十三个县统计，到2月25日共已耙耢春田一千多万亩，灌浇春田二百多万亩。为了总结防旱抗旱经验，山东农业科学研究等部门通过座谈，提出了防旱保墒办法。甘肃定西专区的农民总结了十六种抗旱播种办法，靖远、会宁、陇西、通渭、景泰、皋兰等县的六、七十万亩土地，基本上可以全部下种。
    南方各地也在这个时期结合兴修水利蓄水保水。
    这个阶段，长江流域一些省份的小麦正在孕穗，油菜开始抽苔现花；北方地区的麦田也在开始返青。为了争取今年夏季大丰收，许多地区继续开展防冻、追肥、浇水等活动。麦产区的农民，争取夏熟作物丰收的信心十足。江苏常熟县二十三个乡提出“三麦赶水稻”的口号，保证今年三麦单位产量达到五百斤。
    “惊蛰”前，寒潮由北而南。浙江、江苏、安徽等省的广大农业社员，在寒潮到来以前作了抗寒防冻准备，在寒潮过去以后立即抢救了受冻作物。这次寒潮，对南方地区的夏熟作物危害不大。
    五岭以南一些地区的冬种作物一般生长良好。在这个时期，广东省的小麦已经抽穗结实；油菜、豌豆、蚕豆结荚累累；甘薯、马铃薯的薯块也很大了。这些地区的农业社，正在进行后期田间管理。
    长江流域多数省，继五岭以南等地区之后也将开始培育秧田。湖南省正在发动群众作好谷种消毒工作，以防止病害传播。安徽淮北地区，已打好了水田田埂三百多万亩，整好秧田二十多万亩，为种植早稻作了具体准备。
    甘薯育苗工作，许多地区也开始了。从一些情况看，今年多数农业社在这件农事活动上，比去年早动手半个月到二十天不等。
