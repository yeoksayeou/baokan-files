Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 27th: "We are determined to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years, and strive for the No. 1 Blast Furnace of Baotou Steel to produce iron on the tenth anniversary of National Day." This was proposed by Li Chao, Secretary of the Baotou Steel Party Committee and Deputy General Manager of Baotou Steel, at the Party Representative Conference held on February 24th.

The basic task assigned to Baotou Steel by the state during the Second Five-Year Plan period is to fully complete the first phase of the Baotou Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise. In order to ensure the early completion of Baotou Steel, the Party Congress has issued a call to all employees to "strive for the first blast furnace to produce iron on the tenth anniversary of National Day."

The Baotou Steel Party Committee, after repeated study, believes that it is entirely possible to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years and strive to basically complete the first phase of the Baotou Steel project one year ahead of schedule.

Li Chao reported at the Party Congress that this year marks the peak of Baotou Steel's industrial construction. There are eighty-three major construction projects this year, with the total basic construction investment exceeding the total investment during the First Five-Year Plan period, equivalent to three times the investment last year. Completing this year's construction tasks is to ensure that the first blast furnace produces iron next year and to prepare for even larger-scale construction tasks next year.

    争取一号高炉明年出铁
    包钢进入建设高峰
    据新华社呼和浩特27日电　“决心在四年内完成五年计划，争取包钢一号高炉在国庆十周年出铁”。这是中共包钢党委书记、包钢副总经理李超在2月24日召开的党员代表会议上提出的。
    国家在第二个五年计划期间交给包钢的基本任务，是全部建成包头钢铁联合企业的第一期工程。为了保证提前建成包钢，党代会已向全体职工发出了“争取国庆十周年第一座高炉出铁”的号召。
    中共包钢党委经过反复研究，认为五年计划四年完成、争取提前一年基本建成包钢第一期工程，是完全可能的。
    李超在党代会上报告说，包钢工业建设今年进入了高峰年代。今年主要的工程项目有八十三个，全部基本建设投资超过第一个五年计划期间投资的总和，相当于去年投资的三倍。完成今年的建设任务就是为了保证第一座高炉在明年出铁和迎接明年更大规模的建设任务。
