Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st. Over 10,000 members of various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages in Shanghai gathered at the Cultural Square on the 20th to respond to the call from democratic parties and non-party democratic personages in Beijing to accelerate socialist self-reform.

The conference began at 2:30 p.m., with Jin Zhonghua, a non-party democratic personage, delivering the opening speech. Chen Wangdao, the person in charge of the Shanghai local organization of the China Democratic League, said in his speech that most intellectuals in the League's organization are still far from meeting the requirements of being both "red and expert" and need to make up their minds to intensify their "bone-deep" self-reform. The fundamental way to transform is to put down airs, integrate with workers and peasants in practice, completely burn away ideas that belittle or even antagonize working people, and unify "redness" and "expertise," dedicating knowledge to the people. Everyone should strive to be an innovator in the great leap forward of science, technology, culture, and education. Zhao Zukang and Sheng Pihua, the persons in charge of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK) and the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) Shanghai organizations, called on the members of these two organizations to resolutely and quickly strive to become leftists, ruthlessly abandon the bourgeois lifestyle, and transform themselves into self-reliant laborers as soon as possible. Feng Depei, a non-party democratic personage and famous scientist, also encouraged non-party democratic personages in scientific positions to be promoters of scientific work.

The parade began at 3:30 p.m. Jin Zhonghua, Sheng Pihua, Zhao Zukang, Chen Wangdao, Hu Juewen, Shen Baowen, and other scientists, professors, and doctors who participated in the presidium walked at the front of the parade, holding a huge heart made of red cloth, carrying the resolution unanimously adopted by the conference, and marching towards the location of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee. Democratic parties and non-party democratic personages held up their collective resolutions and individual leap forward plans.

When the procession arrived at the entrance of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, Jin Zhonghua and others handed over the resolution of the Shanghai democratic parties and non-party democratic personages guaranteeing the implementation of the socialist self-reform covenant to the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, requesting the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and all the people of Shanghai to help and supervise their self-reform. Chen Pixian and Wei Wenbo, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, accepted their resolution on behalf of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and the people of Shanghai and congratulated the parade.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st. More than 2,000 members of democratic parties and democratic personages from all walks of life in Henan Province held a "Socialist Self-Reform Promotion Conference" and a parade on the afternoon of the 19th. The conference adopted the "Socialist Self-Reform Covenant" and submitted it to Chairman Mao and the CPC Henan Provincial Committee.

Du Mengmo, Deputy Chairman of the Henan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, called on the participants in his opening speech to dedicate their hearts, knowledge, and everything to the Party and resolutely be leftists. He Shengping, Deputy Chairman of the Henan Provincial Committee of the RCCK, demanded in his speech that members of the RCCK in Henan should not be half-hearted or double-faced but should resolutely shed ambiguity, follow the Communist Party, and strive to ensure that leftists and middle-leftists account for more than 90% of the RCCK organization within three years. Ji Wenfu, a non-party democratic personage and President of Zhengzhou University, said at the conference: We must carry out a bone-deep self-reform revolution. Today's conference is our public solemn guarantee to the Party and the broad masses of the people.

The conference adopted the "Socialist Self-Reform Covenant."

Chen Rutang, Chairman of the Presidium of the conference, called in his opening speech for democratic parties, non-party democratic personages, and industrial and commercial circles throughout the province to take immediate action and launch a high tide of great leap forward in self-reform. Guo Dihuo, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CNDCA, Xu Chongqing, Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Zhang Boquan, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a non-party personage, and others spoke at the conference on behalf of various democratic parties, non-party democratic personages, and industrial and commercial circles. Shang Yanliu, the 80-year-old curator of the Guangdong Provincial Research Institute of Culture and History, read out a letter of determination on behalf of 19 elderly people over the age of 70, expressing their determination to transform themselves into old people who are both red, expert, and healthy.

Huang Youmou, a professor at South China Normal University, presented a letter of determination to the presidium of the conference on behalf of 71 professors from Sun Yat-sen University, South China Institute of Technology, South China Agricultural College, South China Normal University, and Sun Yat-sen Medical College and announced a friendly competition to cultural, educational, and scientific workers throughout the province.
