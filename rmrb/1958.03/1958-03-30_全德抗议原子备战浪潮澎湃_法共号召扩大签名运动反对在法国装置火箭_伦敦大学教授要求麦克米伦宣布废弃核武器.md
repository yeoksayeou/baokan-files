Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: Berlin dispatch: Throughout Germany, the tide of popular protest against the Bonn government's atomic armament policy is constantly rising.

The West German Trade Union Federation, with six million members, convened an emergency meeting of its executive committee in Hamburg on the 28th. The meeting decided to advocate a national referendum in West Germany on the issue of equipping the West German army with atomic weapons and to organize large-scale protest demonstrations. A communiqué issued by the meeting also called on people from all walks of life in West Germany to participate in the "Movement Against Atomic Death."

At the same time, a large number of letters and telegrams from local grassroots trade unions and workers, protesting atomic armament, flooded the West German Trade Union Federation and regional trade union headquarters. In these letters and telegrams, workers demanded a general strike to express their protest.

In many regions of West Germany, workers have been spontaneously striking for days to protest West Germany's atomic armament. On the 28th alone, thousands of workers at West Germany's largest automobile factory, "Volkswagen," 2,500 workers at the Bielefeld "Anker Sewing Machine Factory," and Hamburg shipyard workers held short protest strikes.

In the German Democratic Republic, the working people have also launched a movement against West Germany's engagement in atomic armament. On the 27th, 100,000 people held a rally in Leipzig, calling on the West German working class to organize a powerful people's movement to oppose atomic death and to counter West Germany's comprehensive atomic armament with the working class's general mobilization. Tens of thousands of workers in Dresden and five thousand prominent agricultural scientists and technicians attending a meeting at the "Karl Marx University" in Leipzig also held rallies protesting West Germany's atomic armament and urged the West German Social Democratic Party and the West German Trade Union Federation to lead the working class in taking strong action to defeat Adenauer's atomic war plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 28th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a resolution on launching a campaign against the installation of American rocket launch sites in France.

The resolution stated that despite the achievements already made by the signature campaign, it has not been able to eliminate the threat posed to France and peace by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's decision to install rocket launch sites in Europe. The resolution called on all party members and all party organizations to work hard to rapidly expand the signature campaign against the installation of such launch sites among millions of French people.

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 29th: Two hundred and four professors at the University of London recently co-signed a letter to British Prime Minister Macmillan, demanding that Britain announce the abandonment of nuclear weapons, stop American planes carrying hydrogen bombs from flying over Britain, cease nuclear weapons testing, and refuse to establish rocket launching bases in Britain.

After several exchanges of letters, Macmillan rejected the professors' demands.

    据新华社29日讯　柏林消息：全德各地人民抗议波恩政府原子备战政策的浪潮正在不断高涨。
    拥有六百万会员的西德工会联合会28日在汉堡召开了执行委员会紧急会议。会上决定主张就反对西德军队配备原子武器问题在西德举行全民投票和组织大规模抗议示威。会议发表的公报还号召西德各阶层人民参加“反对原子死亡”的运动。
    同时，各地基层工会和工人群众的大批抗议原子武装的信件和电报，像潮水一般涌向西德工会联合会和各地区工会总部，工人们在这些信件和电报中要求实行总罢工表示抗议。
    西德不少地区的工人连日来已经自动举行了罢工，抗议西德实行原子武装。仅在28日这一天，就有西德最大的汽车工厂——“民众汽车厂”的数千工人、俾雷腓尔德“安克尔缝纫机制造厂”的二千五百名工人以及汉堡造船工人分别举行了短时间的抗议罢工。
    在民主德国，劳动人民也展开了反对西德从事原子武装的运动。27日来比锡市十万人举行大会，号召西德工人阶级组织强大的人民运动来反对原子死亡，用工人阶级的总动员来对付西德的全面原子武装。德累斯顿市的好几万名工人和正在来比锡“卡尔·马克思大学”开会的五千名著名农业科学家与技术人员也分别举行了抗议西德原子武装的集会，并且敦促西德社会民主党和西德工会联合会领导工人阶级采取强有力的行动，来击败阿登纳的原子战争计划。
    据新华社巴黎28日电　法国共产党中央委员会发表了关于开展反对在法国设置美国火箭发射台运动的决议。
    决议说，尽管签名运动已经取得了成就，可是还没有能够消除北大西洋集团关于在欧洲设置火箭发射台的决定使法国和和平遭受的威胁。决议号召全体党员和所有党组织努力使反对设置这种发射台的签名运动在千百万法国人当中迅速开展。
    据新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：伦敦大学的二百零四个教授最近联名写信给英国首相麦克米伦，要求英国宣布废弃核武器，制止载有氢弹的美国飞机在英国上空飞行，停止试验核武器和拒绝在英国建立火箭发射基地。
    经过多次交换信件后，麦克米伦拒绝了这些教授的要求。
