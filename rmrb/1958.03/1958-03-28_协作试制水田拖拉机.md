    Collaborative Trial Production of Paddy Field Tractor
    Recently, various machinery factories in Nanchang held a collaboration meeting and decided to immediately begin trial production of the first batch of tractors suitable for paddy field cultivation. This is a measure taken by Jiangxi Province to realize its agricultural mechanization plan.
    Based on the experience of several years of experimenting with and modifying tractors for paddy field cultivation, the meeting studied the technical design, efficiency, and cost of the tractors to be trial-produced. The meeting determined that all factories should fully collaborate in the trial production process, contributing whatever strength they have.
