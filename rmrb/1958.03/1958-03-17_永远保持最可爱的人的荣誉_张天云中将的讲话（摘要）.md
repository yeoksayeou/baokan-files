Always Maintain the Honor of the Most Beloved Person
Speech by Lieutenant General Zhang Tianyun (Summary)

Dear compatriots of the motherland:

We, who have been away from you for more than seven years, have now returned to the embrace of the motherland, back to our mothers and loved ones. We extend our greetings to our long-separated compatriots of the motherland! We extend our greetings to our beloved Chairman Mao!

Compatriots, when our train sped across the Yalu River Bridge and onto the land that nurtured and raised us, we felt boundless excitement and joy. In particular, the grand and enthusiastic welcome the people of the motherland gave to their victorious returning sons and daughters moved us deeply. However, we also felt very uneasy, because we had merely fulfilled the obligations of an ordinary Chinese citizen. When the motherland was threatened, and when a neighboring country was in distress, we responded to the call to resist America and aid Korea to defend our homes and country, crossed the Yalu River, and together with the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, defeated the aggressors, achieved the Korean Armistice, and after the armistice, jointly maintained peace in Korea. All that the Volunteer Army did was merely what a son or daughter of the motherland should do, and it was all the result of the full support of the people of the motherland, and the result of the correct leadership of our Party and Chairman Mao. All the victories and honors achieved by the Volunteer Army in the great War to Resist America and Aid Korea should be attributed to the great people of the motherland, and to the Party and Chairman Mao!

From the very first day of entering Korea to participate in the war, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has been working hard to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. After the Korean Armistice, from 1954 to 1955, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army took the initiative to withdraw nineteen divisions of troops from Korea in three stages. After the Korean government once again proposed on February 5 this year that all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea to achieve peaceful reunification of Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army responded enthusiastically. After the Chinese and Korean governments held consultations and issued a joint statement on the issue of the Volunteer Army's withdrawal from Korea, the Volunteer Army began the first batch of troops withdrawing from Korea in less than a month. This once again proves to the world that the Volunteer Army's resistance to America and aid to Korea was entirely a just action. Now, peace-loving people all over the world are watching the United States. If the U.S. authorities still have any sincerity for peace, they have no reason to continue to entrench themselves in Korea.

On the eve of our departure from Korea this time, when we bid farewell to the Korean people in various places, moving scenes of China-Korea friendship appeared everywhere. At countless farewell gatherings, the crowds dispersed and gathered again, sent us off and sent us back again, the words were spoken over and over again, and hands were held time and time again. The Korean people and the Volunteer Army were so reluctant to part with each other when they said goodbye. This is not ordinary friendship. This is a fighting friendship cemented with blood, sweat, and red hearts in the joint battle against foreign aggression and in the common labor of building socialism. This kind of friendship cannot be broken by any force, and it will last forever like the flowing water of the Yalu River and the high peaks of Changbai Mountain!

Compatriots! Your sons and daughters have been away from the motherland for more than seven years, and now we have returned to the motherland, which is in the midst of a great leap forward in socialism. We can hardly restrain the excitement in everyone's heart. In the past two or three months, we have heard and seen exciting news from the motherland every day on the radio and in the newspapers. All this is a great encouragement and a powerful spur to the sons and daughters who are far away from their hometown and miss their motherland. Indeed, compared with the earth-shattering and revolutionary spirit of the people of the motherland in socialist construction, the contributions made by our Volunteer Army in the War to Resist America and Aid Korea are just a drop in the ocean. Now that we have returned to the motherland, new posts are waiting for us. All our officers and soldiers are determined – wherever the motherland needs us, we will go there, and whatever the motherland needs us to do, we will do it. We will definitely maintain the honor of "the most beloved person" given to us by the people of the motherland, and continue to contribute everything we have without reservation to the cause of socialist construction and defense of socialist construction.

Long live the great motherland!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao!

    永远保持最可爱的人的荣誉
    张天云中将的讲话（摘要）亲爱的祖国的亲人们：
    离开你们七年多的我们，现在已经回到祖国的怀抱，回到母亲和亲人身边来了。我们向久别的祖国亲人们问好！向敬爱的毛主席问好！
    亲人们，当我们的火车驰过鸭绿江桥踏上抚育和生长了我们的国土的时候，我们的心里无限兴奋和快乐，特别是祖国人民对自己胜利归来的儿女举行这样盛大热烈的欢迎，使我们万分感动。但是，我们也感到非常不安，因为我们只不过是尽了一个普通中国公民应尽的义务。当祖国受到威胁，当邻邦遭到危难的时候，我们响应了抗美援朝保家卫国的号召，跨过鸭绿江，同英雄的朝鲜人民和人民军一起，打败了侵略者，实现了朝鲜停战，在停战后，又共同维护了朝鲜的和平。志愿军所做的这一切，都不过是作为一个祖国的儿女所应该做的，而且，也都是祖国人民全力支援的结果，是我们的党和毛主席正确领导的结果。志愿军在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中所取得的一切胜利和荣誉，都应该归于伟大的祖国人民，归于党和毛主席！
    中国人民志愿军从入朝参战的头一天起，就一直努力于争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。朝鲜停战以后，在1954年到1955年期间，中国人民志愿军就曾经主动地先后三次从朝鲜撤回了十九个师的部队，在今年2月5日朝鲜政府再一次提出一切外国军队撤出朝鲜、实现朝鲜和平统一的主张后，中国人民志愿军就热烈响应，在中朝两国政府就志愿军撤出朝鲜问题进行了磋商并发表了联合声明后，不到一个月的时间，志愿军就已经开始了首批部队从朝鲜撤出的行动，这就再一次向全世界证明了志愿军抗美援朝完全是出于正义的行动。现在，全世界爱好和平的人民都在注视着美国。美国当局如果多少还有一点和平诚意的话，就没有任何理由在朝鲜继续盘踞下去。
    在这次我们撤离朝鲜的前夕，向各地朝鲜人民告别的时候，到处都出现了中朝友谊的动人场面。在无数告别、送行的集会上，都是会散了又集合起来，送出去了又再送回来，话说了一遍又一遍，手握了一次又一次，朝鲜人民和志愿军在分别的时候，是这样依依惜别，难舍难离，这不是寻常的友谊，这是在反抗外国侵略的并肩作战中，在建设社会主义的共同劳动中，用鲜血、热汗和一颗颗赤热的心凝结起来的战斗的友谊。这种友谊是什么力量都拆不开的，它将像鸭绿江的流水、长白山的高峰一样万古长存！
    亲人们！你们的儿女远离祖国七年多，现在又回到正处在社会主义大跃进中的祖国，我们实在抑制不住每个人内心的激动。最近这两三个月来，我们从广播里，从报纸上，每天都听到、看到从祖国传来的一个个激动人心的消息。这一切，对远离家乡怀念祖国的儿女们来说，是莫大的鼓舞，又是有力的鞭策。的确，和祖国人民在社会主义建设中这种翻天复地的伟大气魄、移山倒海的革命干劲比起来，我们志愿军在抗美援朝斗争中所作的贡献，就不过是大海中的一滴罢了，现在，我们已经回到祖国，新的岗位正在等待着我们，我们全体官兵都有决心——祖国需要我们到那里去，我们就到那里去，祖国需要我们做什么，我们就去做什么，我们一定保持祖国人民所给予我们的“最可爱的人”的荣誉，在社会主义建设和保卫社会主义建设的事业中，继续毫无保留地贡献出自己的一切。
    伟大的祖国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
