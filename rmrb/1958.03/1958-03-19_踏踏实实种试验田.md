    Steadfastly Cultivating Experimental Plots
    Going out of the office to cultivate experimental plots has now become a trend. In many areas, thousands of cadres have begun to work diligently in the experimental fields, determined to excellently lead agricultural production and achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production. This is the determination of most comrades.
    However, there are still a few people who do not truly understand the significance of cultivating experimental plots and have shown a superficial, perfunctory, and conservative attitude towards it. Some rural work cadres in Maoming County, Guangdong, treat experimental plots in this way. They say they want to cultivate experimental plots, but they don't go to the fields; the masses' spring sowing is rapidly unfolding, but their experimental plots' sowing is delayed; the masses have greatly increased the production plan targets for vast farmland, but their experimental plots' targets are set very conservatively. How can such an attitude towards cultivating experimental plots guide the masses' production?
    Cultivating experimental plots is an advanced leadership method and a good thing. However, whether good things can achieve good results depends on how you do them. Diligently and steadfastly cultivating experimental plots will definitely yield fruitful results; being careless and perfunctory may turn experimental plots into yield-reduction plots, turning good things into bad things. Therefore, it is said that success depends on human effort.
    May this year's thousands upon thousands of experimental plots become high-yield fields that promote the leap forward in agricultural production!

### 踏踏实实种试验田

    踏踏实实种试验田
    走出办公室种试验田，现在已成风气。在许多地区，成千上万的干部已开始在试验田上辛勤劳动。通过种试验田，出色地领导农业生产，实现农业生产的大跃进。——这是大多数同志的决心。
    但是，也还有少数人没有真正了解种试验田的意义，在种试验田的事情上，表现了虚浮、应付、保守的态度。广东茂名县的一些农村工作干部就是这样对待试验田的。他们嘴说要种试验田，可是人却不下田；群众的春播正在迅速展开，他们的试验田的播种却迟迟不进；群众已把广大的农田生产计划指标大大提高了，他们的试验田的指标却订得很保守。试问用这样的态度来种试验田，怎么能指导群众的生产呢？
    种试验田，是一种先进的领导方法，是好事情。但是，好事情能否收到好效果，要看你怎样去做。勤勤恳恳、踏踏实实地去种试验田，就一定会获得丰硕的收获；马马虎虎，敷衍塞责，就很可能把试验田变成减产田，把好事做坏。所以说，事在人为。
    愿今年千千万万块试验田都成为推动农业生产跃进的高额丰产田！
