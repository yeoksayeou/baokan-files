Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 21st: After the news of oil gushing from oil wells in the central Sichuan oil region spread, congratulatory telegrams flew in from Beijing, Gansu, Xinjiang, Shanghai, Dalian, Yumen, and other places.

The congratulatory telegram from Xinjiang oil workers said: When the news of oil production in central Sichuan reached here, all the oil workers were overjoyed. On March 16th, they held mass rallies in Urumqi, Dushanzi, and Karamay to celebrate the discovery of a large oil region in Sichuan, expressing their full support and ensuring that they would provide whatever support was needed, whenever it was needed.

The Yumen Drilling Company said in its congratulatory telegram: The oil production in central Sichuan is the loudest cannon shot in the leap forward of the petroleum industry, and we are determined to give full support.

The future oil warriors—Sichuan students in the third grade of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Beijing Petroleum Institute—also sent a telegram to congratulate their hometown on becoming an oil town, and expressed their determination to be both red and expert, and to return to their hometown to build the petroleum industry.

This newspaper, Chengdu, March 21st, reporter Li Ce reports: The central and Sichuan departments concerned are vigorously supporting the oil exploration work in the central Sichuan oil region.

The Ministry of Petroleum Industry has decided to transfer a batch of drilling personnel from the Yumen Oilfield, allocate more than 60 deep-well drilling rigs and more than 150 light drilling rigs from various places, as well as a batch of logging and oil testing equipment and large trucks, to support the drilling work in the central Sichuan oil region. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee have decided to give great assistance in allocating and organizing migrant workers, building roads and well sites, and supplying building materials. The Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau has also decided to do everything possible to transfer personnel and equipment from within the organization and its other exploration areas to join this battle.

However, because the drilling task in the central Sichuan oil region this year is very large, the existing petroleum exploration force in Sichuan is far from being able to meet the actual needs; some equipment, etc., cannot be completely solved by the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. Therefore, it is necessary for major cities across the country and other relevant departments to actively provide support and assistance in terms of personnel, machinery, and equipment.

    衷心的祝贺　热情的支援
    据新华社成都21日电　川中油区油井喷油的消息传出以后，贺电不断从北京、甘肃、新疆、上海、大连、玉门等地飞来。
    新疆石油工人的贺电说：当川中喷油的消息传到这里的时候，全体石油工人欢欣若狂。他们在3月16日分别在乌鲁木齐、独山子、克拉玛依召开了庆祝四川发现大油区的群众大会，表示要全力支援，保证作到要什么支援什么，随要随到。
    玉门钻井公司在贺电中说：川中出油，是石油工业跃进声中最响亮的一炮，决心全力支援。
    未来的石油战士——北京石油学院机械系三年级的四川籍学生，也拍电报祝贺家乡成了石油之乡，并且表示要作到又红又专，回乡建设石油工业。
    本报成都21日电　记者李策报道：中央和四川各有关部门正大力支援川中油区的石油勘探工作。
    石油工业部决定从玉门油矿调来一批钻探人员，从各地调拨深井钻机六十多台、轻便钻机一百五十多台，以及一批测井和试油设备和大卡车等，来支援川中油区的钻探工作。中共四川省委和四川省人民委员会，在调拨和组织民工、修建公路和井场，以及供应建筑材料等方面，都决定要给予大大援助。四川石油勘探局也决定从机关内部及所属其它探区，尽一切力量抽调人员和设备投入这一战斗。
    但是，由于今年川中油区的钻探任务很大，四川现有的石油勘探力量远远不能适应实际需要；有些设备等，石油工业部的力量也不能完全解决。因此，需要全国各大城市和其他的各有关部门在人员、机器设备等方面，积极予以支援和协助。
