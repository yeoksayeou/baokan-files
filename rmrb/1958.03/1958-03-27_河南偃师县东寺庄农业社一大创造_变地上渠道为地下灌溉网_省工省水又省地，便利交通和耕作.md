This newspaper's Zhengzhou dispatch on the 22nd: The East Temple Village Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshi County, Henan Province, has created an underground aqueduct irrigation network, overcoming the contradictions of excessive land occupation by field canals and the high labor cost of watching and maintaining canals after water conservancy was achieved.

Last spring, more than 100 mu of land in East Temple Village were cultivated by tractors. They originally wanted to expand the area of mechanized cultivation, but they couldn't because there were too many canals. Therefore, cooperative cadres designed an underground aqueduct irrigation network, based on the principle of tap water. They used tile pipes instead of canals, burying them one meter underground. Using the principles of "water flows from high to low" and "water has pressure," they built four main distribution pools next to four wells. Then, according to the terrain and irrigation needs, they built control distribution pools and overflow pools at the branching points of the main and branch canals, so that water flows into the underground pipes through the distribution pools, and then emerges from the ground through the overflow pools to irrigate the land. Wooden sluice gates were installed at the distribution pools to control the direction and size of the water flow.

This underground aqueduct irrigation network has seven major advantages: "three savings, three conveniences, and one prevention." The three savings are: First, saving land. The 1,600 mu of irrigated land in this cooperative originally had 1,480 zhang of above-ground main and branch canals, occupying about 14.8 mu of land. This land yields three harvests a year. According to the actual output in 1957, this equates to 11,900 fewer jin of grain and 222,200 fewer jin of vegetables. Second, it can save the labor spent on canal maintenance, protection, and watching every year. Third, water flowing underground can greatly reduce evaporation and infiltration, which is estimated to save about 30% of water and expand the irrigated area. The three conveniences are convenience of transportation, convenience of cultivation, and convenience of planting. Eliminating the above-ground main and branch canals makes field work such as transporting manure and harvesting more convenient; the land cut off by the canal ridges can be combined into larger plots, which also makes cultivation easier; sowing can be guaranteed to be even, and seeds will not be wasted due to small plots and many turns. The "one prevention" is: because there are control gates on the distribution pools, it can prevent flooding and achieve planned water use. Currently, this cooperative is producing a large number of tile culvert pipes, striving to convert all 1,754 mu of land in the cooperative (except for 100 mu near the big river) to underground aqueducts before April 15.

Underground aqueducts are not only suitable for plains areas, but also for hilly areas. As long as the principle of "water has pressure" is grasped, so that the main distribution pool is higher than the control distribution pool, and the control distribution pool is higher than the overflow pool, the water can overflow the slope. There is a hillside as high as five or six chi south of East Temple Village, with more than 17 mu of land on the slope. In the past, water had to be manually lifted for irrigation. Now that underground aqueducts have been installed, water flows automatically into the field without effort.

The cost of installing underground aqueducts is much lower than the cost of building canals. The tile culvert pipes used for laying the aqueduct are made of local light clay mixed with water, made into molds, and fired in a fire. Each tile pipe, one chi and five cun long, costs only nine fen. The kiln for firing the culvert pipes is an ordinary brick kiln. This year, installing underground aqueducts in 1,600 mu of land only requires more than 10,000 culvert pipes. Each laborer can make 30 a day, the coal used to fire the pipes is only 60,000 jin, the installation workers number 600, and the total cost is 1,700 to 2,000 yuan, which is only more than one yuan per mu. If canals were to be dug on more than 1,600 mu of land, plus the people watching the canals, more than 3,000 workdays would be required, which would cost more than 3,000 yuan at one yuan per workday; and the canals would also occupy a large amount of land, reducing crop income. The East Temple Village Agricultural Cooperative won a first-class provincial advanced water conservancy model award for the successful creation of underground aqueducts.

Recently, Feng Minggao, Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture, led more than 100 agricultural labor models attending the Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Conference to visit and appraise the cooperative. They unanimously agreed that this is a directional creation after the realization of water conservancy, which is not only suitable for well and pond irrigation; it can also be used for irrigation with free-flowing water and should be widely promoted.

    河南偃师县东寺庄农业社一大创造
    变地上渠道为地下灌溉网
    省工省水又省地，便利交通和耕作
    本报郑州22日电　河南省偃师县东寺庄农业社创造地下水道灌溉网，克服了在实现水利化后，田内渠道纵横占地多和看水、护渠用工多等矛盾。
    去年春天，东寺庄有一百多亩地用拖拉机耕种。他们本想扩大机耕地面积，但是由于渠道太多，无法进行。因此社干部根据自来水的道理就设计了把明渠道改为地下水道灌溉网。他们利用瓦管代替渠道，埋在一公尺深的地下。利用“高向低流”“水有压力”等原理，在四个井旁分别修建了四个总分水池。然后根据地形和灌溉需要，在干、支渠分水处，修建节制分水池和翻池，使水经过分水池流入地下管道，再经过翻水池冒出地面浇地。并在分水池处安装木制闸板，控制水的流向和大小。
    这种地下水道灌溉网，有“三省、三便、一防止”的七大优越性。三省是：第一省地，这社一千六百亩水浇地，原在地面上的干、支渠共计一千四百八十丈长，约占地十四点八亩，这些地都是一年三熟，按1957年实产计算，即要少收粮食一万一千九百斤，蔬菜二十二万二千斤。其次，可以省掉每年由于修渠、护渠、看水等耗费在渠道上的人工。第三，水流地下道，可以大大减少蒸发和渗透，估计可省水30％左右，能扩大灌溉面积。三便是便利交通、便利耕作和便利种植。消除了地面纵横的干、支渠道，送粪、收获等田间劳动，来往方便了；被渠道垅沟割开的土地又可合成大块，耕作也方便了；播种时可以保证匀播，不致因为地块小，拐弯多，而浪费了种籽。“一防止”是：因分水池上有节制闸，可以防止大水漫灌，作到计划用水。现这个社正在大量生产瓦涵管，争取在4月15日以前，把全社一千七百五十四亩地（除一百亩靠近大河的地外），全部改为地下水道。
    地下水道不仅适用于平原地区，也适用丘陵地区。只要掌握“水有压力”的原理，使总分水池高于节制分水池，节制分水池又高于翻水池，水就可以翻过坡地。东寺庄村南有一块高达五、六尺的山坡，坡上有十七亩多地，过去要用人工提水灌溉，现在安装了地下水道，不费劲水就自动流到地里来了。
    安装地下水道的成本比修渠道的成本低得多。铺设水道用的瓦涵管是用当地的轻粘土加水拌匀，制成模，放到火里烧成，每个长一尺五寸的瓦管，成本只要九分钱。烧炼涵管用的窑，就是普通的砖瓦窑。今年全社在一千六百亩地下安装地下水道，只要一万多个涵管，每个劳动力一天可做三十个，烧管用的煤只有六万斤，安装工六百个，全部成本总值一千七百元至二千元，每亩地只用一元多成本。如果要在一千六百多亩地上开渠道，加上看渠道的人，就得用三千多个劳动日，每个劳动日按一元计算，就要三千多元；并且渠道还要占去大量土地，减少农作物收入。东寺庄农业社由于创造地下水道成功，获得了全省一等水利先进模范奖。
    最近，河南省农业厅长冯明高带领出席省农业劳模会议的一百多名农业劳动模范，前往这个社进行了参观和鉴定，一致认为：这是在实现了水利化以后的一个带有方向性的创造，不仅适合于井、塘灌溉；也可用于用自流水灌溉，应当普遍推广。
