Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: According to a Polish Press Agency report on the 19th, a spokesperson for the Polish Foreign Ministry issued a statement regarding the negotiations that concluded a few days ago between the United States and West Germany on supplying the West German army with nuclear weapons. The statement pointed out that the Polish government believes that West Germany's continuous and active demands to obtain nuclear weapons illustrate that within the West German government, the forces of militarist elements are growing daily, and that the West German government's political program is running counter to the clearly growing trend in Europe and within West Germany itself that calls for disarmament and the easing of tensions.

The statement emphasized that the implementation of the plan to arm the West German Bundeswehr with nuclear weapons will force Poland to consider taking certain measures to strengthen its security.

The Polish Foreign Ministry issued this statement to a Polish Press Agency reporter. The statement pointed out that taking these steps in the current environment and at this time is particularly meaningful. Currently, the major powers are exchanging views on convening a summit conference, and world public opinion widely supports the plan to convene this conference. At the same time, public opinion and broad political circles have recently been discussing the Polish government's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Europe. The Polish government's proposal has received full support from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic, but has not yet received a formal response from Western countries, including the United States and West Germany. It seems that before starting talks on this issue, the countries concerned should not take any steps that would create difficulties hindering such talks.

The statement said that despite repeated statements by Western countries that they would not give nuclear weapons to West Germany, the United States government has still expressed its willingness to take this step.

The statement said that it must be regretted that embarking on the implementation of the plan to arm the West German army with nuclear weapons is an attempt to create a fait accompli. This preparation cannot but cause great unease to the Polish people and government, because they are directed against Poland's direct and secure interests.

    波兰不能坐视西德搞核武装
    波外交部声明将采取措施加强安全
    新华社20日讯　据波兰通讯社19日报道：波兰外交部发言人就美国和西德政府几天前结束的用核武器供给西德军队的谈判发表了声明。声明指出，波兰政府认为，西德不断积极要求得到核武器一事说明，在西德政府内部，军国主义分子的势力正日益增长，西德政府的政治纲领是同欧洲和西德内部要求裁军和缓和紧张局势的显然日益增长的趋势背道而驰的。
    声明强调说，实现用核武器武装西德国防军的计划，将迫使波兰考虑采取一定的措施来加强它的安全。
    波兰外交部是对波兰通讯社记者发表这篇声明的。声明指出，在目前这样的环境和时机采取这些步骤是意味特别深长的。目前，各大国正在就召开最高级会议问题交换意见，世界舆论广泛支持召开这个会议的计划。同时，舆论和广大政界人士最近一直在讨论波兰政府关于建立欧洲无原子武器区的建议。波兰政府的建议获得了苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国的完全支持，但还没有得到包括美国和西德在内的西方国家的正式回答。看来，在开始举行这个问题的会谈以前，有关国家不应采取任何足以造成妨碍这种会谈的困难的步骤。
    声明说，尽管西方国家一再声明不给西德核武器，美国政府仍然表示准备采取这一步骤。
    声明说，必须遗憾地说，着手实现用核武器武装西德军队的计划，是企图造成既成事实。这种准备不能不引起波兰人民和政府的极大的不安。因为它们是针对着波兰的直接的和安全的利益的。
