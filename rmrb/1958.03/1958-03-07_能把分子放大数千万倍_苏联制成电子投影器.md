Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th - The Soviet Union has created a super-microscope - an electron projector - capable of magnifying molecular images tens of millions of times. No instrument has ever been able to magnify to such a huge extent. Soviet experts used the electron projector to see individual barium atoms, according to an article published in the Soviet "News" newspaper on the 5th.

It is known that the Soviet Union had earlier created an electron projector that could magnify millions of times and see metal crystal nuclei. Later, the United States created a microscope that could see tungsten atoms with a magnification of 2.9 million times, but the maximum magnification of this microscope was only 10 million times.

The new instrument can see and study the molecules of many substances, such as phthalocyanine dyes, anthracene, and oxygen.

    能把分子放大数千万倍
    苏联制成电子投影器
    据新华社莫斯科6日电　苏联已经制成了一种能把分子影像放大几千万倍的超显微镜——电子投影器，以前从来没有一种仪器能够放大到这样巨大的程度，苏联专家用电子投影器看到了单个的钡原子，这是苏联“消息报”5日发表的一篇文章中说的。
    大家知道，苏联早些时候曾经制成了可以放大几百万倍能看见金属结晶核子的电子投影器，以后美国制成的看见了钨原子的显微镜的放大倍数达二百九十万倍，但是这种显微镜最大放大倍数也只能到一千万倍。
    新仪器可以看见和研究许多物质的分子，如酞青染料、蒽和氧等的分子。
