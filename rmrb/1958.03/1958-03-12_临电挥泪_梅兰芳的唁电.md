    Farewell Telegram in Tears
    Mei Lanfang's Condolences
    I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Comrade Cheng Yanqiu on the ninth due to myocardial infarction. Comrade Cheng Yanqiu's excellent moral character was a model for our opera circle. He devoted his life to artistic labor and made outstanding contributions. In the old society, he fought against evil forces with a strong fighting will. His death is an irreplaceable loss to our opera circle. Recalling our deep friendship of the past forty years, as close as brothers, it is heartbreaking to say goodbye forever. I send this telegram of condolences in tears.

    临电挥泪
    梅兰芳的唁电
    惊悉程砚秋同志以心肌堵塞症于九日逝世，闻之不胜伤悼。程砚秋同志的优良道德品质是我戏曲界的模范，他毕生从事艺术劳动，有卓越的贡献。在旧社会里以坚强的战斗意志与恶势力作斗争。他的逝世是我们戏曲界无可补偿的损失。回忆四十年来，我们亲如手足的深厚情谊，一旦永别，能不痛心。临电挥泪，特此奉唁。
