Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 22nd. Antara News Agency reported that Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio said today that the Indonesian government has appealed to some neighboring countries, asking them not to supply weapons to the rebels in Sumatra. Subandrio said that the government has also made such an appeal to the United States.

Subandrio said that the Indonesian government already knows that the weapons airdropped to the Sumatran rebels are made in the United States, but it is not yet certain where they were shipped from. Therefore, the government has made representations to some neighboring countries and appealed to them not to give weapons to the rebels. In response to the question of whether the weapons airdropped to the rebels came from Taiwan, Subandrio pointed out that some of the weapons came from Taiwan.

Subandrio pointed out that it is wrong for an Asian country to illegally sell weapons to rebels, thereby creating unrest in other Asian countries.

    印度尼西亚正告邻国和美国
    不要把武器供给叛乱分子
    新华社雅加达22日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约今天说，印度尼西亚政府已经向一些邻国发出呼吁，请它们不要把武器供给苏门答腊的叛乱分子。苏班德里约说，政府也向美国发出了这样的呼吁。
    苏班德里约说，印度尼西亚政府已经知道空投给苏门答腊叛乱分子的武器是美国制造的，但是还不能确定它们是从那里运来的，因此政府已经向一些邻国进行交涉并且呼吁它们不要把武器交给叛乱分子。在答复关于这批空投给叛乱分子的武器是否来自台湾的问题时，苏班德里约指出，一部分武器是从台湾来的。
    苏班德里约指出，一个亚洲国家非法出售武器给叛乱分子从而在其他亚洲国家里制造骚乱，这是不对的。
