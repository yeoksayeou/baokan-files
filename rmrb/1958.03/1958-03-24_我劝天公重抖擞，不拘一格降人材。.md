Column: Occasional Notes from the Book World

	"I urge the Heavenly Emperor to bestir himself and bestow talents without sticking to one pattern."
	Gong Zizhen (1792-1842), styled Ding'an, was from Hangzhou, Zhejiang. He was not only a great writer of the mid-Qing Dynasty but also an advanced thinker. He and Wei Yuan, who advocated learning Western science and technology, were known as extraordinary talents in the world at that time. Lin Zexu was also a good friend of his.
	He originally worked in Beijing. On the eve of the Opium War, seeing the corruption of the ruling class and the seriousness of the situation, he decided to return south. He said, "People are accustomed to extravagance and dissipation, and customs are used to wandering. The capital is the worst. The overall situation in the provinces is unsustainable." At this time, Lin Zexu had already arrived in the south and believed that the south was even more dangerous under the aggression of the imperialists, so he wrote to persuade him not to go back, saying in the letter: "Your Excellency intends to travel south, and I dare not stop you, but there are unspeakable difficulties in the situation..." He left Beijing in the summer of 1839 and returned to Jiangnan. The following year, the Opium War broke out.
	He loved the motherland and the people. After leaving Beijing, his emotions were quite agitated. His "Miscellaneous Poems of the Year Ji Hai (1839), Three Hundred and Fifteen Poems" described what he saw along the way from Beijing, including memories of friends and descriptions of various places. After we read through this volume of miscellaneous poems, as Cheng Jinfeng said at the end of the volume: "His voice and emotions are deep and intense, like the mourning of ten thousand jades." Because his emotions were too rich, the infection was too great.
	One of the poems was written while watching the Jade Emperor Festival in Zhenjiang. The original text is: "The vitality of the nine provinces depends on the wind and thunder, and the silence of all horses is ultimately sad. I urge the Heavenly Emperor to bestir himself and bestow talents without sticking to one pattern." This poem of his is completely directed at the current affairs at that time. It means that on the earth, there must always be a stimulating force like wind and thunder to awaken ignorance, promote everything, and make all things vibrant. Otherwise, the twilight will be heavy, like defeated soldiers, which is the most tragic. He also hoped that more heroes and talents would emerge to rectify the world. "Without sticking to one pattern" means including all kinds of specialized talents from all walks of life, that is to say, not adopting a very simple and small number of specifications to require talents or to measure talents. However, rightist element Shi Zhecun, in his article "Talent and Virtue," in order to oppose the Party's policy of attaching equal importance to both virtue and talent in cadres, arbitrarily changed Ding'an's poem to "Using talents without sticking to one pattern," and even said: "Appointing people based on virtue is probably not very appropriate now..." He not only absurdly opposed the Party's policy but also distorted the original meaning of Ding'an's poem.

### “我劝天公重抖擞，不拘一格降人材。”

    “我劝天公重抖擞，不拘一格降人材。”
    龚自珍（1792—1842）字定庵，浙江杭州人，他不只是清朝中期的大文学家，同时也是先进思想家，他和主张学习西洋科学技术的魏源，在当时并称为天下奇才。林则徐也是他的好朋友。
    他本来在北京工作，当鸦片战争前夕，他看到统治阶级的腐朽，时局的严重，决计南归。他说“人心惯于泰侈，风俗习于游荡，京师其尤甚者。各省大局，皆不可支。”这时林则徐已到南方，认为南方在帝国主义者的侵略下，更为危险，来信劝他不必回去，信中说：“阁下有南游之意，弟非敢阻止，而事势有难言者。……”他于1839年的夏天离开北京，回到江南，次年便发生了鸦片战争。
    他是热爱祖国热爱人民的。他出京后，感情颇为激动，他的“己亥杂诗三百十五首”，便是写他由北京起程在沿途所见，其中有怀念朋友的，有描写各地情景的。我们整个读完他这一卷杂诗，诚如卷末程金凤所说：“其声情沉烈，如万玉哀鸣。”因为他的感情太丰富，感染力太大了。
    其中有一首是在镇江看玉皇会写的，原文是：“九州生气恃风雷，万马齐喑究可哀，我劝天公重抖擞，不拘一格降人材。”他这首诗是完全针对当时的时事，意思是说在大地上，总得经常地有像风雷一样的激动力，才能惊醒朦昧，推动一切，使万物生气勃勃，否则暮气沉沉，如同打了败仗的兵马一样，那是最可悲哀的。他又希望多出现一些英雄豪杰来整顿乾坤。不拘一格，就是包括各种各样各行各业的专门人才，也就是说不是采取很简单极少数的几个规格来要求人才、来衡量人才。但是右派分子施蛰存在他写的“才与德”一文里，为了要反对党德才并重的干部政策，竟妄自改定庵的诗为“不拘一格用人才”，还说什么：“任人以德，现在恐怕不很妥当……”。他不只是荒谬地反对党的政策，同时也歪曲了定庵诗的原意。
