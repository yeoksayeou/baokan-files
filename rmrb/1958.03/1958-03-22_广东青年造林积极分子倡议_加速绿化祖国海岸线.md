Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 20th: Youth afforestation activists from twenty-five coastal counties in Guangdong Province have put forward a proposal to the youth of six coastal provinces—Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, and Liaoning—to accelerate the greening of the motherland's coastline.

These coastal youth afforestation activists from Guangdong Province held a conference in Bohe Port, Dianbai County, from the 10th to the 15th of March. In their proposal, they pledged to mobilize two million young people to actively participate in the construction of coastal shelterbelts, and to work with the people of the province to create shelterbelts on 3.2 million mu of beaches, build protection forests along riverbanks, and establish protective forest networks in all farmland areas within two years. The conference mobilized young people to collect seeds, cultivate seedlings, and plant trees themselves. The proposal also called for carrying out large-scale debates and publicity campaigns on the construction of coastal forest belts, and for widely organizing youth shock brigades and forestry production teams to carry out competitions, inspections, and evaluations between communities and teams.
