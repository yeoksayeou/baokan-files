Indigenous Methods Are Also Good Methods
    Wan Xiangxin

    The fact that the Xining Xin Sheng No. 1 Brick and Tile Factory is using simple methods to produce cement, and the Fengjie Sulfur Mine is using indigenous methods to produce chemical fertilizers, are two good pieces of news worth recommending to readers. They are worth recommending not only because these practices are in line with the principle of building the country through diligence and frugality, but also because they point out an important way to solve the current problem of insufficient supply of certain materials.
    In the midst of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, some departments are taking the lead and sprinting ahead. Other departments may temporarily lag behind, creating an imbalance in development between departments. For example, with the large-scale advancement of water conservancy projects and industrial construction, the supply of cement feels inadequate; with the leap forward in agricultural production, the demand for chemical fertilizers greatly exceeds supply. This phenomenon of tight material supply and uneven development between departments is a product of the Great Leap Forward in the national economy, and it is a good phenomenon. However, people cannot be satisfied with this situation and take imbalance as the goal to pursue. The correct approach should be to use the fast horse as a "pacesetter" to enable the lagging departments to catch up and continuously organize new balances according to the advanced links.
    How to organize new balances, how to solve the problem of tight supply of certain materials? The most important method is to increase production. Everyone agrees on this point. However, how to increase production? People's views are not entirely the same. Taking the increase in production of cement and chemical fertilizers as an example, some people believe that it should be solved by building cement plants and fertilizer plants. They pin their hopes on this. It is necessary to build some new factories with modern technical standards, but this is by no means something that can be done overnight. "Distant water cannot quench present thirst," which requires thinking of other methods at the same time. Some areas have put forward the correct policy, which is to actively build new factories and mines using modern technology on the one hand, and mobilize the masses to adopt various indigenous methods and simple methods to strive to increase production on the other hand. The Fengjie Sulfur Mine has produced chemical fertilizer—ammonium sulfate, and the Xining Brick and Tile Factory has manufactured two kinds of cement. The production process is manual operation; the equipment is only wooden barrels, lead pots, brick kilns, and sieves. Compared with modern factories, this production method is really "rustic," but it is economical, convenient, and can also meet the urgent needs of agricultural production, water conservancy projects, and industrial construction in a timely manner. These indigenous methods are not entirely unnecessary in the future when modern factories are everywhere; at present, they are even more indispensable. Isn't it absolutely right to widely promote the experience of Sichuan Province in producing chemical fertilizers by indigenous methods?
    Organizing new balances according to advanced links and striving for an all-round leap forward is an important task at present. In the process of realizing this task, please do not forget indigenous methods.

    土办法也是好办法
    万向辛
    西宁新生第一砖瓦厂用简易方法制造水泥，奉节硫磺厂用土法制造化学肥料，是值得向读者推荐的两条好消息。它们值得推荐，不仅因为这些作法符合勤俭建国的方针，还因为它们指出了解决当前某些物资供应不足问题的重要途径。
    在全民大跃进中，有些部门一马当先带头急驰。另外一些部门会暂时落在后面，形成部门之间发展不平衡的现象。例如，水利工程和工业建设大踏步前进，水泥供应就感到不足；农业生产一跃进，化学肥料就大大供不应求。这种物资供应紧张、部门之间发展不平衡的现象，是国民经济大跃进过程中的产物，是一种好现象。但是人们不能满足于这种状况，把不平衡作为追求的目标。正确的作法，应该是以快马作“标兵”，使落后的部门加劲赶上前去，不断地按照先进环节组织新的平衡。
    怎样组织新的平衡，怎样解决某些物资供应紧张的问题？最重要的办法就是增产。这一点大家意见是一致的。但是，如何增产？人们的看法就不完全相同了。拿水泥和化学肥料的增产问题来说，有些人认为应该靠建设水泥厂、化肥厂来解决。他们把希望都寄托在这上面。建设一些具有现代技术标准的新工厂是需要的，但这决不是一朝一夕能够做到的。“远水解不了近渴”，这就需要同时想别的办法。有些地区提出了正确的方针，这就是一面积极兴建采用现代技术的新厂矿，一面发动群众采取各种土办法、简便方法努力增产。奉节的硫磺厂生产出了化学肥料——硫酸铵，西宁的砖瓦厂制造出了两种水泥。生产过程是手工操作；设备只是木桶、铅锅、砖窑、筛子。同现代化工厂比较起来，这种生产方法实在是“土里土气”，然而又经济，又方便，还能及时供应农业生产、水利工程和工业建设的迫切需要。这种土办法在将来现代化工厂林立的时候，也并非全不需要；在目前，就更是必不可少了。像四川省那样广泛推广土法生产化肥的经验，不是做得大对特对吗？
    按照先进环节组织新的平衡，力争全面跃进，是当前的一项重要任务。在实现这一任务的过程中，请莫忘记土办法。
