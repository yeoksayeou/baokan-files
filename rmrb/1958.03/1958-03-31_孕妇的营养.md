    Nutrition for Pregnant Women
    Cha Liangding

    Nutrition during pregnancy is an important condition for ensuring the health of both the mother and the fetus. Pregnant women should plan their diet according to the characteristics of each stage of pregnancy.

    In the early stages of pregnancy (the first three months), the fetus grows slowly, and the mother's nutritional needs are not much different from before pregnancy. It is sufficient to eat a normal, ordinary diet.

    During this period, pregnant women often experience uncomfortable feelings such as nausea, vomiting, and heartburn, which are often caused by low blood sugar and high ketone bodies. Carbohydrate foods have the effect of raising blood sugar and lowering ketone bodies. The grains we eat daily contain a lot of carbohydrates. Easily digestible and less greasy foods should be chosen, and dry foods rich in carbohydrates, such as dried馒头 (mantou), slices of窝窝头 (wowotou), etc., should be eaten as much as possible; it is also necessary to eat more meals, but it is not advisable to eat too much at one time. It is best to eat something in the morning after getting up and before going to bed. You must not be afraid to eat because of vomiting, as this will easily increase discomfort, because hunger can further promote lower blood sugar and higher ketone bodies.

    In the later stages of pregnancy (the fourth to tenth months), fetal growth accelerates compared to the earlier stages, and materials must be stored for use after birth, especially in the last two or three months. For example, about two-thirds of the calcium used to construct the fetal skeleton is stored in the last two or three months of pregnancy. Therefore, it is very necessary for mothers to eat more nutritious foods, especially those rich in calcium. If the mother's diet is insufficient in calcium, the fetus may suffer from rickets, and the mother herself will naturally have symptoms of calcium deficiency. Milk, goat milk, eggs, soybeans, dried tofu, soft tofu, bok choy, rapeseed, pickled mustard greens, walnuts, sesame paste, and dried shrimp skins all contain more calcium, so you can eat more of them. Secondly, pregnant women often have constipation symptoms in the later stages of pregnancy. If the mother can drink eight to ten cups of water a day and choose some foods with more crude fiber, such as vegetables, fruits, and coarse grains, constipation can be prevented. In addition, edema during pregnancy is also a common phenomenon in the later stages. Reducing salt intake has the effect of treating edema. If necessary, a salt-free or low-salt diet can be adopted.

    Pregnant women need more nutrients than before pregnancy, but it does not require spending more money. For example, millet, millet flour, and mixed flour in grains contain higher nutritional content than refined rice and refined flour. Tofu and bean sprouts are also rich in protein. In addition, foods such as carrots, potatoes, fresh vegetables, dried shrimp skins, and sesame paste are very nutritious and inexpensive.

    孕妇的营养

    孕期营养是保证母亲和胎儿健康的重要条件，孕妇应该根据妊娠各期的特点，计划自己的膳食。
    在妊娠初期（怀孕一至三个月），胎儿生长缓慢，母亲所需要的营养素与孕前没有什么区别，只要食用一般普通膳食就可以了。
    孕妇在这个时期内常会有噁心、呕吐、烧心等不舒服的感觉，这往往是由于血糖低、酮体高所引起的。而醣类食品却有提高血糖降低酮体的作用，我们日常所吃的粮食中就含有很多的醣。应该选用易消化少油腻的膳食，尽量多吃些含醣丰富的干的食品，如馒头干、窝窝头片等；并且需要多吃几餐，但一次不宜吃的过多，最好能在清晨起床后和临睡前吃点东西。千万不应由于怕呕吐而不敢进食，这样反容易增加不适感，因为饥饿更能促进血糖降低酮体升高。
    妊娠后期（怀孕四至十个月）胎儿生长较前加速，同时还要贮存材料备出生后使用，尤其在最后二三个月内更是如此。例如构造胎儿骨胳的钙量，大约有三分之二是在怀孕末二三个月里贮存的。因此母亲多吃营养丰富的、特别是含钙丰富的食物就非常必要了。如果母亲膳食中的钙量不足，胎儿就有患软骨病的可能，母亲本身当然也要有缺钙的症状。牛奶、羊奶、鸡蛋、黄豆、豆腐干、南豆腐、小白菜、油菜、雪里红、核桃、芝麻酱和虾米皮等都含有较多的钙，因此可以多吃。其次在妊娠后期孕妇常有便秘的症状，假如母亲每日能饮水八—十杯并选用一些含粗纤维多的食物，像蔬菜、水果、粗粮等，便秘即可防止。另外孕期水肿也是后期内常有现象，减少食盐量，有治疗水肿的效果。必要时可采用无盐或少盐膳食。
    孕妇所需要的营养素要比孕前增加，但并不需要多花钱。比如，粮食中的小米、小米面、杂合面等就比精米精面所含的营养成分高，豆腐、豆芽等也含有丰富的蛋白质，此外像胡萝卜、土豆、新鲜蔬菜以及虾米皮、芝麻酱等都很有营养价值而价格又便宜的。
