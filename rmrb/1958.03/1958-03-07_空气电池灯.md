Air Battery Lamp

　　The Xinxiang and Anyang battery factories in Henan Province, which are locally state-owned, have recently successfully trial-produced a type of air battery lamp.

　　This air battery lamp is easy to use and comes in many varieties. The small ones are like table lamps, and the large ones are about the size of an ordinary radio. The lamp head can be extended or shortened with a wire as needed. When lit, it is not afraid of wind or rain, and it is hygienic and safe. An air battery lamp that can provide illumination for 700 hours and is brighter than a kerosene lamp costs no more than 4.60 yuan. There is another type of lamp that is brighter than an ordinary 25-watt light bulb and can provide continuous illumination for 400 hours, suitable for nighttime well-digging in rural areas, temporary outdoor construction sites, and nighttime gatherings in towns without electric lights. This lamp is much cheaper than a gasoline lamp.

　　These two air battery lamps, if used for two hours a night, can be used for almost a year.

    空气电池灯
    河南省地方国营新乡、安阳两个电池厂，最近试制成功一种空气电池灯。
    这种空气电池灯，使用方便，品种很多，小的如同台灯，大的有普通收音机大，灯头可以根据需要用电线伸长缩短，点起来不怕风雨，既卫生，又安全。能够照明七百个小时，比煤油灯还亮的一种空气电池灯，售价最高不过四元六角钱；另有一种比普通二十五支光电灯还要亮的灯，可以连续照明四百个小时，适用于农村夜间打井、野外临时工地和没有电灯的城镇夜间集会。这种灯比点汽灯便宜得多。
    这两个人点的空气电池灯以每晚点两小时计算，可以点将近一年
