Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 6th: In Tianjin, out of the 5,590 female cadres transferred to the countryside, factories, and other grassroots units last year to participate in labor production, most were able to shed their intellectual airs, and the majority showed high enthusiasm for labor. Wang Shuzhen, a female cadre from the Tianjin Supply Department of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, after being transferred to the Xiaodian Township Agricultural Cooperative, eagerly took on various heavy tasks. Once, the cooperative launched an intensive five-day and five-night campaign to accumulate fertilizer, and she persisted in carrying soil baskets without complaining once. During water conservancy construction, she stood in the cold mud with her feet and carried muddy frozen soil clods with her hands, never uttering a word of hardship. Female cadres transferred to factories and enterprises also actively participated in labor and diligently studied technology.

Many female cadres, after several months of labor training, have also begun to establish a style of diligence and thrift, cherishing every blade of grass and tree. Dong Fan, a female cadre from the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee's Intermediate Party School, after being transferred to the countryside, realized the value of the fruits of labor. When she went to the fields to pick cotton, she picked all the cotton bolls, regardless of size, leaving nothing behind. One night, a strong wind blew, and she remembered that the cover of the agricultural cooperative's vegetable cellar was not closed properly. She immediately got up, braved the cold wind, and put the cover back on, preventing the cabbage from being damaged.

Because the female cadres actively participate in labor, they are welcomed and loved by the old cooperative members. Ma Meichun, a female cadre transferred from the urban and rural area, because of her active labor and good relationship with the masses, many women often seek her out for help. She was recently elected as the vice director of the township women's federation.

    五千多姊妹在基层扎下根
    天津下放女干部劳动热情高涨
    据新华社天津6日电　天津市去年下放到农村、工厂和其他基层单位参加劳动生产的五千五百九十名女干部，一般都能放下知识分子架子，大多数人的劳动热情很高。建筑工程部天津供应处女干部王淑珍下放到小淀乡农业社以后，抢着干各种重活。有一次，社里连续五昼夜突击积肥，她一直坚持抬土筐，没有喊过一声累。在兴修水利时，她两脚站在冰冷的泥水里，双手搬运泥泞的冻土块，从不叫苦。下放到工厂、企业部门的女干部也积极劳动，认真学习技术。
    许多女干部经过几个月的劳动锻炼，也开始树立克勤克俭、爱惜一草一木的作风。中共天津市委中级党校女干部董凡下放到农村后，体会到劳动果实的可贵，她到地里摘棉花时，不分棉桃大小，都摘得干干净净。一天夜里刮大风，她想起农业社菜窖的盖没有盖好，立即起床冒着寒风把盖盖好，使白菜没有受到损失。
    由于女干部们积极参加劳动，受到老社员的欢迎和爱戴。城厢区下放女干部马梅春，因为劳动积极，和群众关系好，许多妇女有事经常找她，最近还推选她担任乡妇联会的副主任。
