Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 17th: The Hunan Provincial Party Committee convened a telephone conference of the secretaries of the local, municipal, and county Party committees on the evening of the 9th. The Provincial Party Committee believes that the key to doing a good job in spring plowing and production is to boldly mobilize the masses to launch extensive airing of views, contending, and debating on this year’s agricultural production targets and measures, and to thoroughly and conscientiously implement the measures of contracting output, cost, and work points to the team (i.e., the "three contracts"), and determining planting plans, output targets, cost targets (mainly fertilizer targets), technical measures, and work point targets to the plot (locally known as "five to the plot"), so that the plan takes root among the masses. At the same time, we must do a good job in the management and administration of agricultural cooperatives.

The Provincial Party Committee believes that the broad masses are extremely enthusiastic and concerned about the Great Leap Forward, but the work of discussing this year's production plans and implementing the "three contracts" and "five to the plot" has not been balanced or sufficient enough, and the plan has not been implemented among the masses. Some comrades are worried that continuing the extensive airing of views, contending, and debating will overturn the already determined production targets; some comrades feel that the implementation of the "three contracts" and "five to the plot" only has technical calculation issues left, and there is no need to continue mobilizing the masses. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that cadres in various places must further boldly mobilize the masses, engage in extensive airing of views, contending, and debating, revise and enrich the original production targets and measures, and at the same time, firmly establish the production responsibility system and improve the management and administration level of the cooperatives. This is the center of the center of the work of promoting the Great Production Movement in various places. This meeting also discussed other related spring plowing work.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, March 17th: Party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province are taking various methods to conduct a major inspection of spring plowing, promoting the further development of spring plowing production.

The inspection in various places has proven that the production leap forward movement that has been carried out since last winter has created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for this year's spring plowing production in all aspects, especially in ideological mobilization and fertilizer and water conservancy. The inspection also revealed that the production leap forward movement has also brought many new problems to this year's spring plowing production, which are hindering the further development of spring plowing production. Among the more important are: First, the conservative thinking of cadres and members is hindering the implementation of contracting work and output to households. It is understood that out of more than 6,400 agricultural cooperatives in the Shijiazhuang area, only more than 3,700 had completed the contracting of work and output to households before the Spring Festival. In most agricultural cooperatives in Anguo County, the production increase targets had not yet been contracted to production teams when early-maturing crops were about to be sown. Second, basic construction and spring plowing production are advancing simultaneously, farm work is crowded, labor is insufficient, and coupled with improper arrangements, some urgent production activities are progressing slowly. According to statistics from the Department of Agriculture, the sowing work of early-maturing crops, which is related to increased wheat harvest, is progressing quite slowly. As of March 3rd, the six areas with larger sowing tasks had only completed 34% of the early sowing tasks. Third, a large number of water-lifting tools are urgently needed after a large number of water conservancy projects have been built. Fourth, the demand for improved varieties of high-yield crops and early-sowing crop seeds that will be replanted this spring generally exceeds the amount of seeds prepared by one or two times in most areas, and it is urgent to collect and transport them before spring sowing.

After discovering the above-mentioned problems during the inspection, the Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province are simultaneously inspecting and researching, and trying to solve them.

    生产计划必须在群众中落脚生根
    湖南省发动群众讨论跃进措施
    河北正采取积极措施解决生产中的新问题
    新华社长沙17日专电　9日晚湖南省委召开各地、市、县委书记电话会议。省委认为搞好春耕生产当前的关键是放手发动群众对今年农业生产指标措施展开大鸣，大放，大争，普遍认真地贯彻产量、成本、工分包到队（即“三包”），种植计划、产量指标、成本指标（主要是肥料指标）、技术措施、工分指标定到丘（当地称“五到丘”）的措施，使计划在群众中落脚生根。同时搞好农业社的经营管理。
    省委认为当前广大群众对大跃进是极其热情和关心的，但讨论今年生产计划和贯彻“三包”“五到丘”的工作还作得不够平衡，不够充分，计划还没贯彻到群众中去。有些同志担心继续大鸣大放大争会把已经确定的生产指标推翻；有些同志觉得贯彻“三包”“五到丘”只剩下计算技术方面的问题了，不用再继续发动群众了。省委指出各地干部必须再进一步放手发动群众，大鸣大放大争，修正和丰富原来的生产指标措施，同时确实地树立生产责任制，提高社的经营管理水平。这是当前各地推进大生产运动工作的中心的中心。这个会议还对其他有关春耕的工作作了讨论。
    新华社保定17日专电　中共河北省各级党组织正采取多种方法进行春耕大检查，推动春耕生产进一步深入开展。
    各地检查证明，从去年冬季开展起来的生产跃进运动，在各方面特别是在思想发动和肥料水利方面，都为今年的春耕生产创造了空前的有利条件。检查当中同时还发现，生产跃进运动给今年的春耕生产也带来了许多新问题，还障碍着春耕生产的进一步开展。其中比较重要的有：一、干部社员的保守思想，障碍着包工包产的进行。据了解，石家庄专区六千四百多个农业社，春节前作好包工包产的才有三千七百多个。安国县的大部农业社在早熟作物即将播种时，增产指标还没包到生产队。二、基本建设和春耕生产同时并进，农活拥挤，劳力不足，再加上安排不当，便使得一些急迫的生产活动进度迟缓。据农业厅统计，关系麦收增产的早熟作物播种工作，进度相当迟缓。截止3月3日，播种任务较大的六个专区，仅完成早播任务的34％。三、大量兴修水利后提水工具急需增加。四、今春改种的高产作物优良品种和早播作物种籽需用量，一般地区都超过备种数量一两倍，急需在春播前凑集调运。
    中共河北省各级党委在检查当中发现上述问题后，即边检查边研究，设法解决。
