Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 3rd: Three thousand representatives of troops, cadres, workers, and students who gathered in North Vietnam from South Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Accords held a meeting at the Hanoi Labor Club on the 2nd to indict the South Vietnamese authorities' crimes of persecuting the people in the Dai Loc district of Quang Nam province.

The meeting passed a letter of protest to the International Commission, requesting the International Commission to investigate the South Vietnamese authorities' crimes of indiscriminately arresting, torturing approximately eight or nine thousand people in the Dai Loc district from August to the end of last year. The letter of protest also emphasized that the South Vietnamese authorities' crimes in Dai Loc district seriously violated Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords.

The meeting also passed a letter to the persecuted people of Quang Nam province, expressing condolences for their suffering and persecution.

The South Vietnamese authorities once regarded Quang Nam province, one of the former anti-French resistance bases in South Vietnam, as the center of the so-called "Anti-Communist Movement" in the Fifth Interzone in the second half of last year, asking the local people to "expose" and "indict" the Communist Party, but failed due to the lack of support from the people. The South Vietnamese authorities became enraged and turned to indiscriminately arresting and torturing the local people.

    南越当局残害人民
    河内群众举行控诉大会
    新华社河内3日电　根据日内瓦协议从越南南方集结到北方来的部队、干部、工人和学生代表三千人2日在河内劳动俱乐部举行大会，控诉南越当局在广南省大禄县一带迫害人民的罪行。
    大会通过了一封提交国际委员会的抗议信，要求国际委员会到大禄县对南越当局在去年8月到年底在大禄县一带滥肆逮捕和拷打共约有八、九千人的罪行进行调查。抗议信并且强调指出，南越当局在大禄县的罪行严重地违反了日内瓦协定第十四条丙款的规定。
    大会还通过一封写给广南省受迫害的人民的信，对他们遭受的痛苦和迫害表示慰问。
    南越当局曾经在去年下半年以前南越抗战根据地之一广南省作为第五联区的所谓“控共运动”中心，要当地老百姓“检举”和“控诉”共产党，但由于得不到老百姓的支持而告失败。南越当局竟恼羞成怒，转而对当地人民滥肆逮捕和拷打。
