Meetings, Visits, and Internships: Solving Ideological and Technical Problems Simultaneously
Yulin Area Uses On-Site Meetings to Promote Production

(Our dispatch) To promote the great leap forward in production, the Yulin area of Shaanxi Province plans to organize 100,000 people to attend area (on-site) meetings at locations where advanced experiences have been created, while also conducting visits. This will allow the experiences of these model locations to be quickly spread to other areas, taking root and flourishing wherever they are suitable. The first batch of six area meetings hosted by the Area Party Committee (the Garden Ditch Water Field High-Yield Meeting, the Wangjiaping Mountain Field High-Yield Meeting, the Dujia Stone Ditch Soil and Water Conservation Meeting, and the Mati Ditch, Erlang Mountain, and Stone Cave Ditch meetings on digging dry wells, ramming dry wells, and digging water wells) have already concluded. Five hundred and seventy-eight representatives from twelve counties and 227 full-time cadres participated in the area meetings, and their morale is high and their energy is abundant. Commune cadres reflected that "the time is short, but we learn a lot, and we can use it as soon as we get back," "meetings in the city mostly lose something, but this meeting gains a lot," "three days of meetings are worth harvesting a crop," and "if this meeting had been held two years earlier, our commune wouldn't be like this now." Comrade Hou Gaoshang, Deputy County Chief of Suide, said: "After seeing the results of the on-site meetings, I realized that the tens of thousands of yuan we spent each year training agricultural commune members was a complete waste." Wu Fengpeng, Secretary of the Shizuijiyi District in Qingjian, said: "We haven't solved the problem of using walking plows for plowing after so many meetings, but this time when I go back, I will turn the forty old walking plows into dragons [i.e., make them useful]." This shows that area (on-site) meetings are a good way to educate the masses through facts, and also a major leap forward in leadership methods. In order to hold good meetings, the Area Party Committee sent more than ten responsible comrades, including Yu Dejiang, Yao Jinxian, Wei Xianzheng, and Yang Zaiqing, to personally take charge of them separately. The characteristics of the meetings are short duration (the longest is three days, generally two days), simple form, intense and lively atmosphere, vivid and specific methods (seeing, speaking, performing, and practicing), profound lessons, and thorough problem-solving.

The on-site meetings focused on solving three aspects of problems: First, solving right-leaning conservatism and the idea of relying solely on the public, and boosting revolutionary spirit. Can production achieve a great leap forward? Who do we rely on to make great efforts in production? These are questions that many representatives have not yet adequately resolved. Some commune representatives even had doubts about the leap forward achievements in the model locations. Through facts and the introduction of advanced experiences, the on-site meetings convinced the participating representatives of the leap forward achievements in the model locations, and they also learned under what conditions and what measures were taken to achieve them, thereby laying the ideological foundation that it is necessary to achieve a great leap forward, it is possible to achieve a great leap forward, and a great leap forward can be achieved by relying on people's hard work. This was achieved through facts, rather than talking about principles in general terms. After seeing that the miracle of a thousand catties can be created in narrow ditches surrounded by yellow sand on all sides, that Wangjiaping, where one exits the door to see mountains, has achieved high yields for years in mountain areas, and that Dujia Stone Ditch has achieved comprehensive management, the commune representatives said with emotion: "Their leap forward is the result of hard work!" "The key is the role of people, the result of labor, and the meticulousness of cultivation." "Our soil and fertilizer conditions are no worse than theirs in all aspects, the problem is that we don't do it, so we didn't achieve it." "As long as we are determined and put in the effort, there is nothing we can't do." Therefore, they unanimously expressed that they would "learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and achieve a great leap forward in production."

Secondly, solving ideological problems also requires solving technical problems. The method is to bring the actual objects to the site, explain them while demonstrating, and practice on the spot. When the Garden Ditch Commune introduced the fermentation of sand charcoal fertilizer, they brought all kinds of raw materials to the site, explained the mixing ratio of various raw materials, the fermentation time, temperature, and which crops it was suitable for, while also performing a mixing demonstration; the representatives listened and then practiced. Many commune representatives who had sources of sand charcoal fertilizer said: "Garden Ditch carries sand charcoal from ten miles away, but we can just walk out the door and get it, this time when we go back, we will definitely ferment it in large quantities." When introducing high-yield millet, they brought the millet stalks to the site, explained what technical measures were taken to achieve high yields, and the representatives saw that the millet stalks were as tall as a person and as thick at both ends, and said that the technology of the thousand-catty ditch must be seriously learned. The Wangjiaping Commune introduced that using mountain plows can increase production by 17% to 23%, and many representatives did not believe it, so they explained the method of using the walking plow, its effectiveness, while also demonstrating. The representatives saw that the plowed land was indeed flat and deep, and believed that the introduction that the walking plow plowing was "water-retaining, drought-resistant, and greatly increased production" was true. In addition, the commune representatives around Wangjiaping also personally verified that the mountain walking plow greatly increased production and was a dragon [i.e., made them useful], and the representatives were even more convinced. Many representatives said that the reason why their commune's mountain plows were "sleeping plows" and "hanging plows" was due to both ideological and technical problems. While practicing, they expressed that they would vigorously use them when they went back. The eighty-odd commune representatives who attended the meeting reported that they would buy 135 mountain plows. Each advanced experience was explained and demonstrated, so that the representatives of each commune truly achieved "ideological understanding and technical understanding," and were sincerely convinced to catch up with the advanced.

The solution of ideological and technical problems was immediately followed by a great leap forward upsurge of expressing determination, proposing competitions, issuing initiatives, and formulating plans.

In the process of visiting, in addition to learning the good aspects of advanced communes, they also pointed out the shortcomings. Other communes also introduced their outstanding experiences, helped each other, encouraged each other, learned from each other's strengths and made up for each other's weaknesses, and made progress together. After visiting the Garden Ditch Commune, the representatives pointed out that their pig raising and grass planting were very inadequate, and the Garden Ditch Party Branch Commune Management Committee held a meeting that night to discuss how to improve.

    开会参观又实习　思想问题和技术问题同时解决
    榆林地区用现场会议推动生产
    本报讯　为促进生产大跃进，陕西榆林地区计划组织十万人到创造先进经验的点上开地区（现场）会议同时进行参观，使点的经验迅速推广到面，在它适应的地区开花结果。地委主持的地区会议第一批六个（花园沟水地丰产会议，王家坪山地丰产会议，杜家石沟水土保持会议，马蹄沟、二郎山、石洞沟的打旱井、捶旱井、打水井会议）已经结束。十二个县五百七十八个社代表和二百二十七个脱产干部参加地区会议后，情绪高涨，干劲充沛。社干部反映“时间短，学的多，回去就能用”，“城里开会丢的多，这次开会捞的多”，“三天会顶收一茬庄稼”，“这会早开二年，我们社不是现在这个样”。绥德副县长侯高尚同志说：“看了现场会的效果，以前每年花几万元训练农业社员，顶浪费了。”清涧石嘴驿区书武凤鹏说：“开了多少次会还没解决步犁翻地问题，这次回去要将旧存四十部步犁变蛟龙”。这说明地区（现场）会议是通过事实教育群众的好方法，也是领导方法上的一大跃进。为开好会议，地委派鱼得江、姚进贤、卫献征、杨在清等十多个负责同志亲自分头主持。会议特点是时间短（最长三天，一般两天），形式简单，紧张活泼，方法生动具体（看、说、表演、实习），教训深刻，解决问题彻底。
    现场会议着重解决三方面的问题：首先解决右倾保守和单纯靠公家的思想，鼓起革命干劲。生产能不能大跃进？大闹生产依靠谁？这是许多代表尚未很好解决的问题。有些社代表甚至对点上的跃进事迹半信半疑。现场会议通过事实，通过先进经验的介绍，使与会代表坚信了点的跃进事实，并且了解到是在怎样的条件下采取什么措施实现的，从而奠定了应该大跃进、能够大跃进、靠人的苦干就可以大跃进的思想基础。通过事实，而不是泛泛去讲道理。社代表看了四面被黄沙包围的窄沟中能够创造千斤奇迹，出门就是大山的王家坪连年高额丰产，以及杜家石沟的综合治理以后，感慨的说：“人家跃进是下了苦工夫！”“关键是人的作用，劳动的结果，作务的细致。”“我们的土质肥料各方面条件不亚于人家，问题是不去办，结果没办到。”“只要下决心，花工夫，没有办不到的事。”因而一致表示要“学先进，赶先进，实现生产大跃进”。
    其次，解决了思想问题还要解决技术问题。方法是把实物拿到现场，一边讲解，一边表演，一边就实习。花园沟社介绍沤制沙炭肥料时把各种原料拿到现场，一边讲解沙肥各种原料混合的比例，沤的时间、温度，适应那种作物，一边就作搅拌表演；代表听了就动手实习。许多有沙炭肥源的社代表说：“花园沟在十里地背沙炭，我们出门就是，这次回去一定大量沤制。”介绍丰产谷子时，把谷秆拿到现场，讲解采取什么技术措施才实现丰产的，代表们看到谷秆有人高，两端一样粗，表示千斤沟的技术必须认真学习。王家坪社介绍使用山地犁可以增产17％至23％，好多代表不相信，于是一边介绍步犁使用方法、功效，一边表演，代表们看了耕过的地果真底平又深，相信步犁耕过“含水、耐旱、增产大”的介绍是真实的。再加王家坪周围的社代表也经亲身体验证明山地步犁是增产大，是蛟龙，代表们更确信无疑了。好多代表说他们社的山地犁所以是“睡犁”、“挂犁”，既有思想问题，也有技术问题。一面动手实习，一面表示回去要大力使用。到会八十多个社代表自报买山地犁一百三十五部。每项先进经验都通过讲解表演，使各社代表真正做到“思想通、技术通”，口服心服赶先进。
    思想问题和技术问题的解决，紧接着就出现了表决心，提竞赛，发倡议，订计划的大跃进热潮。
    参观过程中除了学习先进社好的方面，同时也指出不足的地方。其他社也介绍自己突出的经验，互相帮助，互相勉励，取长补短，共同跃进。参观花园沟社后代表们提出他们养猪、种草方面很不够，花园沟党支部社管会当晚就开会讨论如何改进。
