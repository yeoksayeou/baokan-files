Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: The first group of returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops received large quantities of gifts and letters of gratitude from the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean government, and people from all over Korea.

The gifts presented en masse by the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean government, and the Korean people included: 80,000 catties of apples, 80,000 boxes of specially made cigarettes, 40,000 cans of canned goods, and 500 bottles of ginseng liquor. In addition, the Korean people in various regions spontaneously gave the Volunteer Army a large number of gifts and letters of gratitude. The people of Ichon County alone sent more than 3,000 letters of sympathy to the Volunteer Army, and more than 1,000 souvenirs such as silver rings, handkerchiefs, red scarves, and copper bowls.

These letters of gratitude fully express the profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. Old Mrs. Li Zhenri of the Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sacheon-ri, Ichon County, asked the Volunteer Army to bring a letter of thanks to a Chinese mother. The letter said: The excellent children you sent fought side by side with the Korean People's Army in the war and defeated our common enemy. After the war, while guarding the defense line, they actively participated in our country's restoration and construction work. Now, they are about to return to your embrace. We really hate to be separated from them, but we have to be separated. We will always thank you and never forget them and all the Chinese people.

Li Guangxi, a student at the Fourth Middle School in Ichon County, wrote in a letter of sympathy to the Volunteer Army: The internationalist spirit of Volunteer Army uncles such as Luo Shengjiao and Shi Yuanhou will always be imprinted in our hearts. Uncles are about to leave us, but the glorious achievements that uncles left in Korea will shine brightly in our history forever.

The people of Ondong-ri, while sending a letter of sympathy to the Volunteer Army, also sent a stone-carved cigarette case. This cigarette case was a souvenir left by ancestors 152 years ago. This time they gave it to the Volunteer Army as a souvenir. The letter said: We hope that after you return to your country, every time you take out a cigarette from the cigarette case, you will not forget your friends far away in Korea.

Korean elder Song Yongyue gave the Volunteer Army a water ladle. The letter said that this ladle was used by my ancestors in the war against the Japanese pirates more than 200 years ago and is the most precious treasure in my family. In order to thank you for helping us repel the invaders, I specially give it to you as a souvenir.

    礼重情更重　宝物赠英雄
    朝鲜人民送志愿军大批礼物
    新华社18日讯　中国人民志愿军首批回国部队，收到了朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府和各地人民大批礼物和感谢信。
    朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民成批赠送的礼物有：苹果八万斤，特制的香烟八万盒，罐头四万筒和人参酒五百瓶。此外，各地朝鲜人民自动给志愿军的大量礼物和感谢信，仅伊川郡人民寄给志愿军的慰问信就有三千多封，赠给志愿军的银戒指、手帕、红领巾和铜碗等纪念品就有千余件。
    这些感谢信里，充分地表达了中朝人民的深厚友谊。伊川郡四青里第二农业生产合作社李珍日老大娘托志愿军带给中国母亲一封感谢信。信上说：您们派来的优秀儿女，他们在战争中同朝鲜人民军并肩作战，打败了我们的共同敌人；战后，他们又在坚守防线的同时，积极地参加了我国的恢复建设工作。现在，他们就要回到您们的怀抱里去了。我们真舍不得和他们分离，但又不能不分离。我们永远感谢你们，永远也不会忘记他们和全中国人民。
    伊川郡第四中学学生李光熙在给志愿军的慰问信上写道：罗盛教和史元厚等志愿军叔叔的国际主义精神，将永远印在我们的心灵上。叔叔们快离开我们了，但叔叔们留在朝鲜的光辉业迹，将在我国历史上永远灿烂放光。
    温洞里的人民，在给志愿军的慰问信的同时，还送来一个石刻的烟盒。这个烟盒是在一百五十二年前，从祖先遗留下来的纪念品。这次他们把它赠给了志愿军作纪念。信上说：希望你们回国后，每当从烟盒里拿出香烟的时候，不要忘记远在朝鲜的朋友。
    朝鲜老人宋永岳，他赠给志愿军一只水瓢。信上说，这个瓢是在二百多年前我的祖先在反对倭寇侵略的战争中使用过的，是我家最珍贵的宝物。为了感谢你们帮助我们打退了侵略者，特把它送给你们留念。
