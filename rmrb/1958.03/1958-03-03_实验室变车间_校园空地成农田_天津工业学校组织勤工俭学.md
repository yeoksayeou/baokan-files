    Laboratories Become Workshops, Schoolyard Vacant Land Turns into Farmland
    Tianjin Industrial School Organizes Work-Study Program
    (Our Dispatch) Tianjin Industrial School plans to transform its practice factories and laboratories into production workshops, and turn water pits and vacant land into bases for developing sideline occupations, fish ponds, and gardens. All teachers and students will labor while teaching and learning, striving to avoid any state funding this year and also train more than 300 secondary technical personnel for the country.
    The industrial school has more than 1,500 students, a practice factory with 60 machine tools and many tools, and two relatively large laboratories. In the past, these production facilities were only used for student practice. Not only did they not produce products, but they also consumed 90,000 yuan worth of raw materials each year.
    In view of this wasteful situation, the school leadership accepted the opinions put forward by the masses and formulated a plan for the entire school to run frugally and engage in work-study programs. The plan stipulates: using the method of combining education and production, mobilize all teachers and students to labor while teaching and learning, in order to increase income and achieve self-sufficiency. Starting this semester, all students will take turns participating in labor under the leadership of teachers. The school's practice factory and motor laboratory plan to produce transformers, water pumps, motors, and other machine parts; the chemical laboratory will produce Antu rat poison, saccharin, and some dye intermediates. In addition, the school will also plant 45 mu of gardens, raise pigs, ducks, and fish, and grow lotus roots. In order not to increase the burden on teachers and students, the school will also streamline some unnecessary teaching materials and improve the quality of education. At present, the school has accepted orders from Tianjin Hardware Company, Electromechanical Bureau, and other units.

    实验室变车间　校园空地成农田
    天津工业学校组织勤工俭学
    本报讯　天津市工业学校计划把实习工厂、实验室变成生产的车间，把水坑、空地变成开展副业、鱼池和园田，全校师生一面劳动，一面教学和学习，争取今年不要国家分文，还要为国家培养三百多名中等技术人员。
    工业学校有一千五百多学生，拥有六十台机床和许多工具的实习工厂和两个规模较大的实验室。这些生产设备过去只供学生实习之用，它不但不生产产品，每年还要消耗九万元的原材料。
    根据这种浪费的情况，该校领导方面接受群众提出的意见，制订了全校勤俭办学、勤工俭学的规划。规划中规定：以教育和生产相结合的办法，发动全校师生，一边教学和学习，一边劳动，以增加收入，做到自给自足。自本学期起，全校学生将在老师的率领下，轮流参加劳动。该校实习工厂和电机实验室计划生产变压器、水泵、马达与其他一些机器零件；化工实验室将生产安妥鼠药、糖精和一些染料中间体。另外，该校还要种植四十五亩园田，养猪、养鸭、养鱼、种藕。该校为了不加重师生的负担，还将精简一部分不必要的教材和提高教育质量。目前，该校已接受天津市五金公司、机电局等单位的订货。
