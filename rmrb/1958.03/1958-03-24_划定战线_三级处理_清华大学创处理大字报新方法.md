Defining Battle Lines, Three-Tiered Processing
Tsinghua University Creates New Method for Handling Big-Character Posters

(Our report) Tsinghua University has created a new method for handling big-character posters. During the Double-Anti Movement, Tsinghua University has proposed a new approach to how to post big-character posters in an orderly manner for easy reading, and how to quickly address the issues raised by the big-character posters. Simply put, it is eight characters: "Define battle lines, three-tiered processing." Defining battle lines means: opinions about the class are posted centrally within the class; opinions about the department are posted centrally within the department; opinions about the entire university are posted separately in designated areas for the entire university, such as: opinions about school leaders and professors are posted in the "School Leaders and Professors Area"; opinions about scientific research and production internships are posted in the "Scientific Research and Production Internship Area," and so on. In this way, the torrent of big-character posters can each return to its source, in good order. This not only facilitates reading and improves the quality of the big-character posters, but also provides favorable conditions for timely problem-solving. Three-tiered processing means: problems that can be resolved in the class are immediately resolved in the class; problems that cannot be resolved in the class are then submitted to the department leadership for processing; problems that the department still cannot resolve are then submitted to the school leadership for processing. At the school leadership level, processing is divided into several areas such as Party, Youth League, academic affairs, and general affairs. This is conducive to quickly and promptly resolving solvable problems, and also helps the school leadership concentrate its efforts on addressing major issues.

Because Tsinghua University has adopted this working method, although the Double-Anti Movement has just begun at their school, they are already starting to address some issues that can be resolved immediately.

    划定战线　三级处理
    清华大学创处理大字报新方法
    本报讯　清华大学创造了处理大字报的新方法。在双反运动中如何使大字报张贴有序，便于阅读；如何才能迅速处理大字报所提出的问题，清华大学在这方面，提出了一个新的尝试。简单说来是八个字：划定战线，三级处理。划定战线是：关于班级的意见集中贴在班上，关于系的意见集中贴在系里，关于全校性的意见分别贴在全校性的专门园地上，如：关于校领导和教授的意见，有“校领导和教授园地”；关于科学研究和生产实习的意见，有“科学研究和生产实习园地”等等。这样，可以使大字报的洪涛，各归本流，井井有序。这就不但便于阅读，有利于提高大字报的质量，同时，也为及时处理问题提供了有利条件。三级处理是：班上能处理解决的问题，立即在班上处理解决；班上不能解决的，再提到系领导处理；系还不能解决的问题，再提到校领导上处理。校领导一级，分为党、团、教务、总务等几个方面分别处理。这样，既有利于迅速、及时地解决能解决的问题，也有利于学校领导集中力量处理主要问题。
    清华大学因为采用了这样的工作方法，所以，虽然双反运动在他们学校还刚开始，却已经同时在着手解决一些立即可以解决的问题了。
