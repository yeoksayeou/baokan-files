Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 30th -- 50,000 cadres transferred to lower levels in Jiangxi Province are bringing culture to the mountainous farmers. In the mountainous areas, which were once culturally desolate, the sound of reading can now be heard everywhere.

"Where there are cadres, there are people's schools and night schools!" This is the slogan put forward by the transferred cadres. Wherever they go, people's schools and night schools have been established one after another. In the old revolutionary base area of Damao Mountain, cadres transferred to the Damao Mountain Reclamation Farm have helped establish night schools in the surrounding thirteen villages. All young and middle-aged farmers and school-age children who have not yet enrolled in school are participating in the learning. Huangxie Village is more than ten miles away from where the cadres of the reclamation farm live. The two transferred cadres who serve as teachers in the village's night school always cross mountains and ridges to teach every night, regardless of wind or rain, without interruption. The farmers are also very enthusiastic about learning. As soon as it gets dark, they all take lanterns and torches to school and study until late at night. Farmers in the Jinggang Mountains live in dispersed locations, making it inconvenient to concentrate on running schools. The Jinggang Mountain Reclamation Farm has adopted a method of assigning responsibility by area, that is, wherever there are squadrons and teams, farmer night schools and reading groups are set up in the homes of farmers. The transferred cadres who serve as teachers and readers also actively learn local dialects, while promoting Mandarin to the farmers. Cadres transferred to Jinggang Mountain have established a plan to raise the cultural level of the people of Jinggang Mountain as one of the important tasks in building Jinggang Mountain, requiring that all young and middle-aged illiterate people and school-age children who have not yet enrolled in school on Jinggang Mountain be able to roughly read newspapers and write simple letters within two years. In addition to organizing people's schools and night schools to eliminate illiteracy, the transferred cadres of Wugong Mountain and other reclamation farms have also established study classes for educated young and middle-aged farmers, with cadres with higher levels of education serving as teachers to study higher-level courses.

Jiangxi Province's transferred cadres have established more than 100 reclamation farms in mountainous areas. These areas are mostly old revolutionary base areas that suffered severe destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation, and their culture is more backward than other areas. Therefore, the leading organs of Jiangxi Province have attached great importance to how transferred cadres bring culture to mountainous farmers while participating in labor training from the very beginning, and proposed that the cadres of each reclamation farm are not only production teams, but also work teams and cultural teams. At the meeting of the heads of the reclamation farms held in January, each farm jointly formulated a plan to "work hard for three years to change the cultural and educational outlook of the mountainous areas." Now the implementation of this plan has begun and has been warmly welcomed by the people in the mountainous areas.

    把文化带上山区
    江西五万下放干部大办民校
    新华社南昌30日电　江西省五万下放干部把文化带给山区农民，在一向文化沉寂的山区，现在到处都是读书声。
    “那里有干部，那里就有民校、夜校！”这是下放干部们提出的口号。他们所到之处，民校、夜校已经一个接着一个地办起来了。在革命老根据地大茅山区，下放到大茅山垦殖场的干部已帮助周围十三个村庄都建立了夜校，这些村的所有青壮年农民和未入学的适龄儿童都参加了学习。黄歇村离垦殖场干部住的地方有十多里路，担任这个村夜校教师的两个下放干部，每天晚上总是翻山越岭、不避风雨地去上课，从未间断过。农民们学习热情也很高，天一黑就都拿着灯笼、火把去上学，读书直到深夜。井冈山上农民居住分散，不便集中办学，井冈山垦殖场便采取分片包干的办法，即是有中队和小队所在的地方，就地在农民家里办起农民夜校和读报组。担任教师和读报员的下放干部还积极学习方言，同时他们又向农民推广普通话。下放到井冈山的干部已定出规划，把提高井冈山人民的文化水平当做建设井冈山的重要任务之一，要求两年内使井冈山上的青壮年文盲和未入学的适龄儿童全部达到能粗读报纸和写简单的书信。武功山等垦殖场的下放干部除组织了民校、夜校扫除文盲外，还成立了知识青壮年农民的学习班，由文化程度较高的干部担任教员，学习更高的课程。
    江西省下放干部在山区建立了一百多个垦殖场，这些地区大都是革命老根据地，解放前遭受国民党反动派的严重摧残，文化比其他地区落后。因此，江西省领导机关对于下放干部在劳动锻炼的同时如何把文化带给山区农民，一开始就非常重视，提出了各垦殖场的干部不仅是生产队，同时也是工作队和文化队。在1月份召开的各垦殖场场长会议上，各场又共同制定了“苦战三年，改变山区文化教育面貌”的规划，现在这个规划的开始实现，受到了山区人民的热烈欢迎。
