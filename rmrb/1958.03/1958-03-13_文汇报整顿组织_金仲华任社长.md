Wen Hui Bao Reorganizes its Organization
Jin Zhonghua Appointed as President
(Our newspaper, Shanghai, 10th dispatch) After achieving victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, Wen Hui Bao has now completed its organizational rectification. Comrade Jin Zhonghua has been appointed as the President of the newspaper, and Comrade Chen Yusun has been appointed as the Vice President and Editor-in-Chief. Xu Zhucheng, the former President and Editor-in-Chief and a Rightist, has been removed from his post. The newspaper has also transferred a number of reporters and editors from other units.

Starting from July last year, Wen Hui Bao, in coordination with the capital and Shanghai press circles, went through more than half a year of anti-Rightist struggle, achieving a decisive victory, reversing the newspaper's political direction, and "ferreting out" eighteen Rightists: including President and Editor-in-Chief Xu Zhucheng, Deputy Editor-in-Chief and Director of the Beijing Office Pu Xixiu, editorial board members Huang Shang, Chen Qinyuan, editors Chu Yukun, Mei Duo, Xu Fengwu, reporters Yang Chongye, Xie Weiming, Liu Guanghua, Yao Fangzao, Lü Wen, Fan Yan (i.e., Huan Bangxian), Lu Xu, Rong Zhengchang, Jiang Xianliang, Zhu Jiashu, and Mei Huanzao, secretary of the administration department. In this struggle, all kinds of Rightist fallacies were smashed.

During the rectification phase, the entire staff conducted a thorough airing of views, contention, and debate on how to run Wen Hui Bao as a socialist newspaper with its own characteristics. It was clarified that the newspaper's policy should be: under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to implement the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals and the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and to strive for the establishment of a working-class intellectual contingent and the promotion of socialist culture and socialist revolution and construction.

    文汇报整顿组织
    金仲华任社长
    本报上海10日电　文汇报在取得了反右派斗争的胜利之后，现在已经完成了组织上的整顿。报社现已由金仲华同志担任社长，陈虞孙同志担任副社长兼总编辑。原任社长兼总编辑右派分子徐铸成已经撤职。报社并从其它单位陆续调来了一些记者和编辑。
    文汇报从去年7月开始，与首都和上海新闻界相配合，经过半年多的反右派斗争，取得了决定性的胜利，扭转了报纸的政治方向，“揪”出了十八个右派分子：计社长兼总编辑徐铸成、副总编辑兼北京办事处主任浦熙修，编委黄裳、陈钦源，编辑储玉坤、梅朵、徐凤吾，记者杨重野、谢蔚明、刘光华、姚芳藻、吕文、范琰（即宦邦显）、陆续、容正昌、江显良、朱嘉树和管理部秘书梅焕藻。在这场斗争中，各种各样的右派谬论被粉碎了。
    在整改阶段中，全社对如何把文汇报办成一张社会主义的、又有特点的报纸，进行了大鸣大放、大争大辩。明确了文汇报的方针应该是：在中共上海市委领导下，贯彻团结、教育、改造知识分子政策和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，为建立工人阶级知识分子队伍、促进社会主义文化和社会主义革命与建设而奋斗。
