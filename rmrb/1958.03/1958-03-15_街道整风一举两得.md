The experiences of rectifying the style of work among residents in the streets of Tianjin, Shanghai, and Beijing tell us that it is absolutely necessary to adopt the policy of extensive airing of views, big contending, and great debate to carry out a rectification movement among urban street residents. All doubts and misgivings on this issue should be dispelled.

Street resident rectification is another aspect of our nationwide rectification movement and a new development of socialist democracy. It has two purposes: one is to help the Party and the government rectify the style of work, that is, to educate our cadres; the other is to raise the awareness of street residents, that is, to educate the residents themselves.

Street residents are the largest segment of the general urban population, including people from all walks of life. Street residents are in constant contact with our Party and state's grassroots organizations, as well as stores, hospitals, and public utilities. Many of our Party and state's policies are also frequently implemented among street residents. Therefore, many shortcomings in our work and in the style of our cadres, which we ourselves may not feel, are felt very concretely by street residents. Therefore, mobilizing street residents to fully air their views and express their opinions on the work of the Party and the government and on cadres is very beneficial to improving our work and the style of our cadres. If we do not do this, bureaucracy, subjectivism, sectarianism, as well as official airs, lethargy, arrogance, extravagance, and delicacy in our organs and cadres, especially in grassroots organizations and grassroots cadres, may still find a hiding place.

However, street residents generally do not directly participate in production, and they do not have many opportunities to participate in social activities. They are generally not good at using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, especially when it comes to offering opinions on the Party, the government, and cadres. They even have some concerns: fearing that offering opinions will offend people, fearing that speaking poorly will cause them to lose face, fearing that nothing will change even if they offer suggestions, and so on. At the same time, the opinions of street residents may initially be largely concentrated on trivial matters of daily life. These situations all require sufficient attention. Comrades who lead street resident rectification should explain the significance and purpose of the nationwide rectification to the residents in a detailed, patient, and unwearying manner, explain the principles and policies, and explain and educate them on the problems existing in the residents' minds. They should try every means and adopt flexible and diverse forms to encourage residents to express their opinions and help us improve our work and rectify our style of work. We should also pay full attention to some of the small opinions raised by street residents and correct them immediately if they can be corrected, in order to encourage them to offer more opinions.

Some people may also worry that street residents are of mixed quality and that while many correct opinions will be offered, many wrong opinions will also be expressed. What should we do with these wrong opinions? There is a way. The way is to organize the masses to debate, in order to achieve another purpose of street rectification: to let the masses educate themselves.

The struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism also exists among street residents. For example, there will be both correct and wrong views on the state's policy of planned supply of grain, cloth, and cooking oil, on the relationship between developing production and improving living standards, on the superiority of the socialist system, on grassroots democratic elections, and so on. The most effective way to resolve this contradiction is to let street residents debate themselves. We should trust the majority of street residents and believe that through such debates, old capitalist ideas will be broken and new socialist ideas will be established, greatly improving the awareness of street residents. The experience of street resident rectification in Tianjin is the best proof.

    街道整风一举两得
    曾志
    天津、上海和北京街道居民整风的经验告诉我们，采取大鸣大放大争大辩的方针，在城市街道居民中进行一次整风运动十分必要，在这个问题上一切怀疑和顾虑都应该打消。
    街道居民整风，是我国全民整风运动的又一个方面，是社会主义民主的新发展。它的目的有二：一个是可以帮助党和政府整风，也就是教育我们的干部；另一个是可以提高街道居民的觉悟，也就是教育居民自己。
    街道居民是一般城市群众中数量最多的一个部分，其中包括了各个阶层的人民。街道居民同我们党和国家的基层组织、以及商店、医院和公用事业整天接触，我们党和国家的很多政策，也经常要到街道居民中去贯彻执行。因此，我们工作中和干部作风中的许多缺点，可能我们自己并不觉得，而街道居民却感觉得非常具体。因此，发动街道居民大鸣大放，把他们心里对党和政府工作、对干部的意见都提出来，对我们的工作和干部作风的改进，是大有好处的。不这样作，我们机关和干部中特别是基层组织和基层干部中的官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义，以及官气、暮气、骄气、阔气、娇气就还可能找到一个藏身之处。
    但是，街道居民由于不直接参加生产，平时参加社会活动的机会也不多，一般都不善于运用批评和自我批评的武器，特别是对党、政府和干部提出意见更不习惯，甚至还或多或少地存在着一些顾虑：怕提意见得罪人，怕说得不好丢面子，怕提了不改等等。同时街道居民的意见，最初很可能大量集中在日常生活的细小事件方面，这些情况，都需要引起足够的注意。领导街道居民整风的同志，要细致地、耐心地、不厌其详地向居民讲清楚全民整风的意义和目的，交代方针、政策，并且要针对居民思想中存在的问题进行解释教育，要想尽一切方法，采取灵活、多样的形式鼓励居民把心里的意见都提出来，帮助我们改进工作，整顿作风。对街道居民提出的一些小意见，也应该充分注意，能改的即时改正，以鼓励他们提出更多的意见。
    有人还会顾虑：街道居民、良莠不齐，提出正确的意见的固然会很多，发表错误意见的也会不少。对这些错误的意见怎么办呢？有办法。办法就是，组织群众辩论，以便达到街道整风的另一个目的：让群众自己教育自己。
    资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争在街道居民中同样存在着，比如对国家实行的粮、布、食油的计划供应政策，对发展生产和改善生活的关系问题，社会主义制度的优越性问题，基层民主选举问题等等，都会有正确的和错误的两种看法。解决这一矛盾的最有效的方法就是让街道居民自己去辩论。我们应该相信街道居民的多数，相信通过这种辩论一定会破资本主义旧思想，立社会主义新思想，使街道居民的觉悟大大提高。天津街道居民整风的经验就是最好的证明。
