    Spring Ploughing Dynamics
    Jiangxi Raises Field Ridges
    When repairing field ridges during spring ploughing, farmers in Jiangxi Province are raising the ridges by one or two "gongcun" (centimeters), so that when the spring rains come, the fields will be full of water. This is to compensate for the fact that 12 million mu of paddy fields still lack water conservancy facilities after this year's water conservancy tasks are completed. According to calculations, if all of the province's existing 36 million mu of paddy fields have their ridges raised by 1.5 "gongcun", and the water storage is increased by 1 "gongcun", the total water volume will be equal to 30% of the total water storage of the province's existing water conservancy projects, which is equivalent to building 9,000 reservoirs each capable of irrigating 1,000 mu of paddy fields.
    Huainan Area Sows Early Rice
    Wuhu Prefecture has sown 1.2 million jin of early rice seeds. The early sown seeds have already sprouted. More than 3 million jin of the 5.3 million jin of early rice seeds in Anqing Prefecture have been soaked in soda water, and the germination rate is generally very high. The paddy fields in these two areas have also begun to be plowed.
    This year, Anhui Province plans to promote double-cropping rice on more than 8 million mu in the Jiangnan and Huainan areas, more than double last year. Last year, a few agricultural cooperatives' early rice sowing and transplanting were slightly late, which affected the increase in late rice production; this year, these agricultural cooperatives have learned from last year's lessons and are sowing and transplanting earlier.
    Inner Mongolia Rushes to Deliver Manure
    Many agricultural cooperatives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are dividing into two shifts, day and night, with people and horses resting but vehicles not, rushing to deliver manure to the fields. Some farmers in western Inner Mongolia are preparing the land to conserve soil moisture. The work of stubble removal in the eastern region is also being carried out vigorously.
    The work of selecting seeds, repairing farm tools, raising draft animals, improving soil, chopping grass, grinding fodder, and preparing firewood has also been fully launched. Farmers in Tokto County, Fengzhen County, Qingshuihe County, and the suburbs of Baotou City, south of the Daqing Mountains, have repaired more than 11,000 pieces of various farm tools. Hangjinhou Banner on the Hetao Plain, which is set to achieve a yield of 400 jin per mu this year, is carrying out large-scale soil improvement, land leveling and levee construction, and converting flood irrigation to furrow irrigation.
    Busy Preparations in Northern and Southern Tianshan
    Spring ploughing preparations in the vast rural areas north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang have begun to take shape as a surge. More than 58 billion jin of fertilizer are being transported to the fields, ready for spring ploughing and sowing. Areas such as the Turpan Basin, which have warmer weather, are currently engaged in intense spring ploughing and sowing. Leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the grassroots to lead the masses in preparing for ploughing. Bachu County recently also organized four rounds of evaluation among districts and townships to launch a ploughing preparation competition.

    春耕动态
    江西加高田塍
    江西省农民在春耕中整修田塍时，都把田埂加高了一两公寸，以便降春雨时蓄满水，弥补今年水利任务完成后尚有一千二百万亩水田缺少水利设施的不足。据计算：全省现有的三千六百万亩水田都加高田塍一点五公寸，增蓄一公寸高的水，总水量便等于全省现有水利工程蓄水总量的30％，等于修了每座能灌溉一千亩水田的水库九千座。
    淮南地区播种早稻
    芜湖专区已播下早稻种一百二十万斤。播得早的已经露青。安庆专区五百三十万斤早稻种，有三百多万斤经过苏打水浸过，发芽率一般很高。这两个地区的水田也已开始翻犁。
    安徽省江南、淮南地区，今年计划推广双季稻八百多万亩，比去年增加两倍多。去年，少数农业社曾因早稻播种、插秧稍晚，影响了晚稻的增产；今年，这些农业社吸取去年的教训，提早播种插秧。
    内蒙古突击送粪
    内蒙古自治区许多农业社正分成白天黑夜两班，歇人歇马不歇车，向田里突击送粪。内蒙古西部有些农民正在整地保墒。东部地区的拖茬搂茬工作，也在大力进行。
    精选种籽、整修农具、饲养耕畜、改良土壤、铡草、磨料和准备烧柴等工作，也已全面展开。大青山南麓的托克托县、丰镇县、清水河县和包头市郊农民，已经修好各种农具达一万一千多件。今年就要实现每亩产量四百斤的河套平原上的杭锦后旗，正在大规模地进行土壤改良、平地打堰和改漫灌为畦灌等工作。
    天山南北备耕忙
    新疆天山南北广大农村的春耕备耕工作已开始形成热潮。五百八十多亿斤肥料正在运往田间，准备春耕播种。天气较暖的吐鲁番盆地等地区，目前正在紧张地进行春耕播种。各地领导干部已纷纷深入基层，领导群众备耕。巴楚县最近还组织各区、乡进行了四次评比，展开备耕竞赛。
