    Not Wasting an Inch of Land
    Shaanxi Province is taking various measures to restore abandoned land and plant vacant land. From last summer to the present, agricultural cooperatives in Yan'an and Hanzhong Special Districts have organized remote farming teams to go to the mountains to restore abandoned land and reclaim some gently sloping wasteland, expanding the cultivated area by more than 30 million mu.

    不浪费一分地
    陕西省正在采取各种措施恢复弃耕土地和种植空闲地。从去年夏天到目前，延安、汉中两专区的农业社分别组织远耕队，上山恢复弃耕地，并且开垦了一部分缓坡荒地，共扩大耕地三千多万亩。
