Response to Criticism

    Taiyuan Post Office No Longer Goes Backwards
    The letter from Comrade Duo Yuntao published in the People's Daily on March 8th, criticizing our bureau for canceling the door-to-door newspaper and magazine collection method, is completely correct. After research, we have decided to restore the door-to-door collection method from April onwards to facilitate subscribers.

    太原邮局不再开倒车
    人民日报3月8日刊载多运韬同志的来信，批评我局取消报刊登门收费办法，完全正确。经过研究，我们决定从4月份起，恢复登门收费的办法，以便利订户。
                （太原市邮电局）
