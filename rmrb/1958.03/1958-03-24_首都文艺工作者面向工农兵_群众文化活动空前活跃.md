Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch from the Capital: Capital literary and art workers, in conjunction with the current great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, are vigorously assisting workers, peasants, and soldiers in carrying out amateur cultural activities.

    Some professional art troupes have begun to implement the guidance plans they have formulated. The Central Philharmonic Orchestra Choir, with more than seventy members, has been going to more than sixty factories in the eastern suburbs since the 17th to teach new songs such as "Socialism is Good" and "Revolutionary People." Factories where cultural activities were previously poor are now filled with singing every evening. The singing activities are even more active in factories with better employee cultural activities, such as the China Youth Publishing House Printing Factory and the State-owned No. 1 and No. 2 Cotton Textile Factories, and many employees' family members are also participating in the "Sing Together" movement. The Central Philharmonic Orchestra has already held training classes for accordion and music conducting, and plans to establish eighty choirs, teaching 50,000 people to sing five new songs before May Day. The Central Song and Dance Troupe plans to guide twenty-two dance troupes, ten folk song teams, and twenty folk music bands. The Central Experimental Opera House Dance Drama Troupe will create seventy-six group dances this year to conduct guidance in factories and rural areas.
    Some units, such as the Chinese Artists Association and the Chinese Musicians Association, have changed their past reluctance to do guidance work and have proactively requested to participate in mass cultural activities from the Beijing Mass Art Museum. More than 150 artists, including cartoonists Hua Junwu and Zhong Ling, painters Ai Zhongxin and Dong Xiwen, sculptors Liu Kaiqu and Hua Tianyou, and traditional Chinese painter Ye Qianyu, have expressed their willingness to participate in mass guidance work. Old traditional Chinese painters with white hair, such as Yu Feian and Qin Zhongwen, are also preparing to organize lectures, performances, and compile painting albums for guidance. Guqin players Cha Fuxi and Pu Xuezhai, who are in their sixties, will also perform several music concerts for workers, peasants, and soldiers every month and are preparing to establish Guqin and Pipa training classes to pass on their art.
    After criticizing bourgeois literary and artistic ideas such as detachment from reality and detachment from the masses in the "Double-Anti" movement, the mass cultural activities of the capital's literary and art workers serving workers, peasants, and soldiers have become unprecedentedly active. Street poetry has appeared in front of the Wangfujing Avenue Literary and Art Building, and the new works of poets and workers posted there have attracted many passersby. Many literary and art workers are rushing to write about the heroic deeds of workers and peasants in the socialist great leap forward, and some literary and art workers have already gone deep into the masses. Composers Qu Xixian and others went to the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site to work alongside everyone in order to create new songs that the masses love. Dancers Wu Xiaobang and Sheng Jie went to Guangdong and Fujian respectively to excavate and sort out local folk traditional dances and are preparing to provide guidance to the masses. Famous singers Liu Shufang and actor Xiao Bai Yushuang also went to small theaters in Tianqiao, which they had never visited before, to sing for rickshaw workers, farmers, and other working people. The Central National Song and Dance Troupe also plans to perform songs and dances in the streets. The Central Philharmonic Orchestra is preparing to carry out street singing, allowing the people of the capital to make a comprehensive great leap forward in joyful singing.
    Many publications are also further oriented towards workers and peasants. "Folk Literature" clearly stated that this publication is a popular reading material for workers and peasants, and recent issues have increased the number of works by workers and peasants. The fourth issue of "Poetry Journal" will publish more than forty poems created by workers. The third issue of "Beijing Literature and Art" published diverse forms of big-character posters, challenge letters, pile-driving songs, and allegro poems, most of the authors of these works are workers and peasants who had never written articles in the past. The editors of "Quyi" magazine have collected more than 100 works such as clapper talk, storytelling, and doggerel from factories and rural areas and are preparing to publish them. This publication also requires that every published work can be spoken and sung so that it can truly penetrate into the amateur cultural life of the masses.

    首都文艺工作者面向工农兵
    群众文化活动空前活跃
    本报特约新华社专稿首都文艺工作者结合当前工农业生产大跃进，正大力协助工农群众开展业余文化活动。
    一些艺术专业团体已开始执行他们订出的辅导规划。中央乐团合唱队有七十多人，从17日起分别到东郊区六十多个工厂教唱“社会主义好”、
  “革命人”等五个新歌曲。过去文娱活动较差的工厂，现在每天傍晚也传出了歌声。职工文娱活动比较好的中国青年出版社印刷厂、国营第一、二棉纺织厂等工厂，歌咏活动更活跃了，有许多职工家属也参加了“大家唱”。中央乐团已举办了手风琴和音乐指挥两个训练班，计划建立八十个合唱团，在“五一”前教会五万人能会唱五支新歌曲。中央歌舞团计划辅导二十二个舞蹈团、十个民歌队、二十个民乐队。中央实验歌剧院舞剧团，今年要创作七十六个集体舞到工厂、农村进行辅导。
    中国美术家、音乐家协会等一些单位都改变了过去不愿作辅导工作的情况，主动地向北京市群众艺术馆要求参加开展群众文化活动。漫画家华君武、锺灵，画家艾中信、董希文，雕塑家刘开渠、滑田友，国画家叶浅予等一百五十多位美术家表示要参加群众辅导工作。白发苍苍的老国画家于非暗、秦仲文等也准备组织讲座、表演、和编写画册来进行辅导。六十多岁的古琴家查阜西、溥雪斋等也要每月为工农群众演出几场音乐，并准备成立古琴、琵琶训练班传授他们的艺术。
    首都文艺工作者在“双反”运动中，批判了脱离实际脱离群众等资产阶级文艺思想以后，为工农兵服务的群众文化活动空前活跃起来。在王府大街文艺大楼门前出现了街头诗，在那里张贴的诗人和工人的新作品吸引了很多来往行人。许多文艺工作者在赶写着反映工农在社会主义大跃进的豪迈事迹，有些文艺工作者已深入到群众中去。作曲家瞿希贤等为了能创作出群众喜爱的新歌曲，到十三陵水库工地上和大家并肩劳动。舞蹈家吴晓邦、盛婕分别到广东和福建，挖掘和整理当地的民间传统舞蹈，并准备对群众进行辅导。著名的歌唱家刘淑芳和演员筱白玉霜，也到从未去过的天桥的小剧场，为三轮车工人、农民等劳动人民演唱。中央民族歌舞团也计划到街头表演歌舞。中央乐团正准备开展街头唱，让首都的人民在欢腾的歌声中全面大跃进。
    许多刊物也进一步面向工农。“民间文学”明确提出这个刊物是个工农普及的读物，近几期已增多了工、农群众的作品。“诗刊”第四期将刊登四十多个工人创作的诗篇。“北京文艺”第三期刊出了形式多样的大字报、挑战书、打夯歌、快板诗等，这些作品的作者，大部分都是过去没有写过文章的工人和农民。“曲艺”杂志社的编辑已从工厂、农村搜集到快板、快书、顺口溜等一百多个作品准备刊登。这个刊物还要求作到刊登的每篇作品都能说能唱，以便使它能真正深入群众业余文化生活中去。
