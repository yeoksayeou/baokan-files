Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 6th. Shanghai's music circles, in the city-wide upsurge against waste and conservatism, have created a new experience: musicians go to the front lines of the mass movement, creating on the spot, performing on the spot, and teaching the masses to sing on the spot, so that creation and performance are harmoniously matched with the rhythm and melody of the times, giving full play to the great power of art in promoting production leaps.

    In the past week, the Shanghai Chorus has divided into two teams to go deep into nine advanced factories that are fighting against waste and conservatism, reading big-character posters, chatting with workers, and conceiving compositions. As soon as the musical score is initially completed, it is immediately mimeographed, practiced, and quickly taught to the workers. They created 75 new songs in seven days. In the No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory, the chorus personnel created four new songs such as "Advanced Deeds Are Endless" in two hours using real people and real events. The chorus created the new song "State Cotton No. 12 Factory is Red, Red to the End" in the State Cotton No. 12 Factory. Comrades in the factory said, "We will report good news to you with production results!" A few days after the chorus returned, they received a call from the factory: the factory produced a batch of high-quality yarn, and the chorus created another "Congratulatory Song" to perform at the factory.

    The Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station's Broadcasting Orchestra has been active among railway employees these days. On the evening of March 1st, the employees of the Shanghai Railway Administration worked late into the night, posting hundreds of thousands of big-character posters against waste and conservatism overnight. The Broadcasting Orchestra also performed for them from late at night until dawn. Someone wrote a poem on the spot and dedicated it to the Broadcasting Orchestra: "A fierce battle against the two evils, songs send blessings, dancing my complete victory, full of energy!" The orchestra immediately set it to music and performed it.

    The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the National Orchestra, and the teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music are also using this method of on-site creation and on-site performance to participate in the booming Great Leap Forward. The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra created 80 songs in four days.

    The Shanghai music circles' method of closely integrating with reality has not only prospered musical creation and launched a mass singing movement, but also brought the feelings of musicians and workers closer together. Now, the Shanghai drama and art circles are also adopting this method of quickly reflecting and promoting actual activities.

    当场创作　当场演出　当场教唱
    上海音乐界生活在沸腾的群众运动里
    据新华社上海6日电　上海音乐界在全市反浪费反保守的高潮中，创造了一项新的经验：音乐家走上群众运动的第一线，当场创作、当场演出、当场教群众唱，使创作与演唱和谐地配上时代的节奏和旋律，发挥艺术推动生产跃进的巨大力量。
    上海合唱团在最近一个星期中，分成两个队深入到九个反浪费反保守的先进工厂，一边看大字报，一边和工人谈心，一边就构思作曲。曲稿初成，马上油印，立即练唱，而且迅速教工人学会唱，他们七天内就创作了七十五首新歌。在印染一厂，合唱团的人员两小时内用真人真事创作了“先进事迹说不完”等四首新歌。合唱团在国棉十二厂创作了“国棉十二厂红呀红到底”的新歌，厂里同志说：“用生产成绩向你们报喜！”合唱团回来几天以后接到这个工厂的电话：厂里出了一批优质纱，合唱团又作了一首“祝贺歌”到厂里去演唱。
    上海人民广播电台的广播乐团，这几天活跃在铁路员工中。3月1日晚上，上海铁路管理局机关的员工挑灯夜战，一夜贴出几十万张反浪费反保守的大字报，广播乐团也为他们从深夜演唱到天明。有人当场写了一首诗献给广播乐团：“双反酣战夜，歌声送门台，舞我全胜志，浑身干劲来！”乐团马上把它谱成曲子演唱。
    上海交响乐团、民族乐团和上海音乐学院的师生们也正在用这种现场创作、现场演出的办法，参加到如火如荼的大跃进高潮中去。上海交响乐团在四天内就创作了八十首歌曲。
    上海音乐界密切结合实际的方法，不仅繁荣了音乐创作，展开了群众性的歌咏运动，也使音乐家和工人群众的感情接近起来。现在，上海戏剧界、美术界也在采取这种迅速反映和推动实际的方法进行创作活动。
