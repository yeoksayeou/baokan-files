Does Nitrogen Not Support Life?

    If a candle is lit inside a glass bell jar placed over a shallow dish of water, the water level inside the jar will rise before long. It will rise to about one-fifth of the jar's height, and then the candle will extinguish. If a live mouse or sparrow is placed inside the glass jar, it will soon suffocate and die. Teachers or books will tell you that this is because the oxygen in the air has been used up by combustion, and what remains is nitrogen. From this, it seems that nitrogen is detrimental to life. In fact, the word nitrogen in its original Greek meaning is "not supporting life."

    But does nitrogen truly not support life? Quite the contrary, nitrogen is an indispensable component of all living organisms. Engels once said, "Life is the living protein." And on average, proteins contain about 17% nitrogen. There is no organism that does not contain nitrogen.

    Almost 99.9% of nitrogen exists in the air, occupying 75.5% of the total weight of the air. However, animals do not directly absorb nitrogen through breathing. Animals, including humans, obtain organic nitrogen that has already formed proteins by eating plants and other animals. Strictly speaking, the nitrogen in other animal bodies also comes from plants.

    Like animals, plants cannot directly absorb nitrogen from the air, but they can absorb nitrogen from the soil and use it to produce proteins. Obviously, as a result of continuous absorption by plants, the nitrogen in the soil will gradually decrease. To replenish the nitrogen lost in the soil, fertilization is needed.

    In China, the application of manure and urine as fertilizer has been practiced for a long time. However, one thousand catties of manure only contain five catties of nitrogen. China also adopted methods of crop rotation and intercropping with leguminous plants very early on, using the rhizobia of leguminous plants to increase nitrogen in the soil. In addition, natural nitrates (such as saltpeter) can also be directly used as nitrogen fertilizers.

    Since there is so much nitrogen in the air, can we find a way to utilize it? Normally, as a result of lightning discharges during thunderstorms, oxygen and nitrogen in the air combine into nitric acid and are brought to the ground as nitrates. In addition, nitrogen-fixing bacteria can also fix nitrogen from the air into fixed nitrogen. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria live parasitically on the roots of legumes, forming nodules, so they are also called rhizobia. This is a natural method of utilizing nitrogen. Currently, it is possible to artificially produce fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate and calcium cyanamide from nitrogen in the air. China's three major chemical plants in Jilin can produce both of these fertilizers.

    With the great leap forward in agricultural production and the rapid development of the chemical industry in our country, nitrogen—the element that "does not support life"—is contributing its immense power to humanity, to the development of life, in the peaceful labor of mankind!

### 氮不支持生命吗？

    氮不支持生命吗？
    在一个复盖在浅水盘上的玻璃钟罩内点燃一只蜡烛，不一会罩内的水面就会上升，上升到五分之一的地方，蜡烛便要熄灭。假如放一只活的老鼠或麻雀在玻璃罩内，不久它就窒息而死。教师或书本会告诉你：这是因为空气中的氧被燃烧用完了，而剩下来的是氮。这样看来，好像氮对生命是不利的。事实上氮这个字在希腊文的原意中，就是“不支持生命”。
    氮真是不支持生命吗？恰巧相反，氮正是一切有生命的机体所不可缺少的组成部分。恩格斯曾说：“生命便是活着的蛋白质”。而蛋白质中，平均说来，就含有约17％的氮在内。没有一种生物体内没有氮。
    差不多有99.9％以上的氮是存在空气中，占据了空气总重的75.5％。但是，动物并不是通过呼吸的办法来直接吸收氮。动物，包括人在内，都是通过吃植物和其他动物来获得已经组成了蛋白质的有机氮。严格地说，其他动物体的氮，也是从植物得来的。
    同动物一样，植物也不能直接吸收空气中的氮，但是它能吸收土壤中的氮素，利用氮素制造蛋白质。显然，植物不断地吸收的结果，土壤内的氮就会逐渐减少。为了补充土壤中失去的氮，就需要施肥。
    在我国，早就施用粪尿作肥料。但是一千斤粪中只有五斤氮。我国也很早就采取豆科植物的轮作与间作的方法，利用豆类植物的根瘤菌来增加土壤中的氮。此外，天然的硝酸盐（如硝石）也可以直接作为氮肥。
    既然空气中含有那么多氮，能不能设法利用它呢？平常，由于雷雨放电的结果，空气中的氧同氮便化合成硝酸而被带到地面变成硝酸盐。此外，氮菌也能够从空气中把氮固定下来成为固定氮。氮菌寄生在豆类根上成为瘤状，所以又叫根瘤菌。这是利用氮的自然方法。目前，已经能够用人工的方法把空气中的氮制成硝酸铵和氰胺化钙等肥料。我国吉林的三大化工厂都能生产这两种肥料。
    随着我国农业生产的大跃进和化学工业的飞速发展，氮——“不支持生命”的元素，正在人类的和平劳动中为着人类、为着生命的发展而贡献出它的巨大的力量！
