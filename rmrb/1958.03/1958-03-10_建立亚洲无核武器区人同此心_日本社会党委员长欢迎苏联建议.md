Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, said on the 9th that the Soviet proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia is consistent with the consistent policy of the Socialist Party.

He believes that the Soviet proposal can be said to be a response to the letter he wrote in early February to the heads of state of sixteen countries, including the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. In this letter issued in Suzuki's name, the Japan Socialist Party suggested taking measures such as establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones and holding East-West talks to ensure the security of Japan and Asia and to ease international tensions.

Suzuki revealed that American planes carrying missiles are taking off from Okinawa and circling over Japan, and that nuclear-powered vessels are patrolling the Japanese coast. He said that for the security of Japan and Asia, it is necessary to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia.

Suzuki made these remarks during a travel speech in Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture. He pointed out that the Japan Socialist Party is prepared to submit a bill in the Diet opposing the establishment of nuclear weapons and missile bases in Japan, and prohibiting the transportation of nuclear weapons and missiles into Japan. He said that after the Diet passes the draft budget, the Japan Socialist Party will also submit a motion of no confidence against the Kishi Nobusuke government in early April.

    建立亚洲无核武器区人同此心
    日本社会党委员长欢迎苏联建议
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎9日说，苏联关于在亚洲建立无核武器地区的建议是和社会党一贯的政策一致的。
    他认为，苏联这个建议可以说是对他在2月初写给美国、英国、苏联等十六个国家的首脑的信的反应。日本社会党在以铃木的名义发出的这封信中，曾经建议采取建立无核武器地区和举行东西方会谈等措施，保障日本和亚洲的安全以及缓和国际紧张局势。
    铃木揭露从冲绳起飞的载有导弹的美国飞机在日本上空盘旋，原子舰艇在日本沿海巡逻。他说，为了日本和亚洲的安全，有必要在亚洲建立无核武器地区。
    铃木是在京都府宇治市发表旅行演说时谈这番话的。他指出，日本社会党准备在国会中提出反对在日本建立核武器和导弹基地、以及禁止把核武器和导弹运进日本的议案。他说，国会通过预算草案以后，日本社会党在4月初还要对岸信介政府提出不信任案。
