Concerning the Spiritual Food of Cadres Sent to Lower Levels

Editor's Note: From the following letter, we can see that cadres sent to lower levels need spiritual food. They need not only political theory books and agricultural technology books, but also literary books. In addition to local post offices and Xinhua bookstores making every effort to deliver various books and periodicals to the countryside and to the cadres sent to lower levels, it is also hoped that county cultural centers and libraries will find ways to meet the cultural needs of the cadres sent to lower levels.

We have been sent to the agricultural front for more than five months. In their spare time, many comrades have also read some books. In addition to reading political theory books, some have also read books such as Michurin's planting methods and vegetable cultivation techniques. However, some comrades also read old novels such as "The Three Heroes and Five Gallants" and "The Little Five Gallants." It is perfectly fine for cadres sent to lower levels to read some literary books in their spare time, but it is not very good to read books like "The Three Heroes and Five Gallants," because these books do not help our labor training and ideological transformation at all. We hope that the relevant leading organs will pay attention to this issue and find ways to solve it.

    关心下放干部的精神食粮
    编者按：从下面这封来信可以看出，下放干部需要精神食粮。他们不但需要政治理论书籍和农业技术书籍，还需要文艺书籍。除了各地邮局和新华书店应当多方设法，把各种各样的书刊送到农村送到下放干部手中以外，还希望县文化馆、图书馆，也来设法满足下放干部文化生活方面的需要。
    我们下放到农业战线上已经五个多月了。在劳动余暇，许多同志还看了一些书。除读政治理论书外，有的还读了米丘林的种植法、蔬菜栽培技术之类的书。但是也有一些同志去看“三侠五义”、“小五义”等旧小说。下放干部在劳动之余读些文艺书是完全可以的，但是看“三侠五义”这样的书就不大好。因为这些书对我们的劳动锻炼和思想改造没有一点帮助。希望有关领导机关注意这个问题，并设法解决这个问题。
