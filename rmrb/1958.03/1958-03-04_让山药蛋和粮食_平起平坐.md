From Various Newspapers:

	Let Sweet Potatoes and Grain "Sit on an Equal Footing"
	The March 1st Shanxi Daily published an editorial titled "Let Sweet Potatoes and Grain 'Sit on an Equal Footing,'" explaining the importance of sweet potato (i.e., potato, same below) production.
	The editorial said: Sweet potato is one of Shanxi Province's famous agricultural products. In recent years, although sweet potato production has increased somewhat, it still cannot meet people's needs. This is partly due to the severe disasters that have struck, and partly due to the fact that people do not yet pay enough attention to increasing sweet potato production. In some places, there is a trend of thought that planting sweet potatoes is not as good as planting grain, and even eating sweet potatoes is considered shameful. This is a great injustice to sweet potatoes and a great disrespect to high-yield crops. Therefore, we must loudly appeal here: raise the status of sweet potatoes and make sweet potatoes and grain equal!
	The editorial said: The reason we want to fight for status and honor for sweet potatoes is because sweet potatoes are a high-yield crop. One mu of ordinary sweet potatoes can produce about 2,000 jin, which is much higher than the yield of ordinary grain fields. If cultivated well, the yield can be greatly increased. For example, Zhang Sanren of Tianjinggou, Ningwu, produced 10,360 jin of sweet potatoes per mu in 1953. This year, Shanxi Province plans to plant more than 5 million mu of sweet potatoes. If these 5 million mu can harvest 10 billion jin of sweet potatoes, it will greatly change the grain supply situation and improve the lives of urban and rural people. It is of great political significance for better solving the grain problem and ensuring and promoting the entire socialist construction. Because sweet potatoes are not only a delicious vegetable, but also can be made into a variety of staple foods and non-staple foods. For example, adding a little flour to sweet potato flour can be used to steam steamed buns and eat noodles. As long as we think of a way, we can raise the status of sweet potatoes from a non-staple food to a staple food. It contains carbohydrates, proteins and other nutrients that are extremely important to humans. Its calorific value is 554 kilocalories per jin, which is no less than most grains. Some people worry that the nutritional value of sweet potatoes is not high, but there is actually no basis for this. In addition, sweet potato flour residue can also be used to make wine, vinegar, and sauce. Sweet potato starch is also a raw material for national defense industry and medicine manufacturing, and can be organized for export to exchange for important materials such as steel.
	The editorial said: Sweet potato production is so high and its uses are so wide. However, some people still have concerns about planting sweet potatoes, such as being afraid that if they plant too much, the state will not purchase it and they will not be able to adjust their lives; being afraid that it will be difficult to process and store; being afraid that it will not be transported out, etc. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee have put forward specific solutions to these problems in the joint instructions on greatly increasing the production of tubers. As long as we fully educate the masses and mobilize the masses, these problems can be completely resolved.
	The editorial pointed out: In order to ensure the great leap forward in sweet potato production, all localities must widely publicize the superiority of sweet potatoes, so that people will love them more—plant them and eat them, and strengthen technical guidance for sweet potatoes so that they can produce more and better. At the same time, local governments should also take necessary measures in terms of price policies, transportation, storage, and processing, and prepare early to solve a series of problems that may arise due to the large increase in sweet potato production, in order to increase the enthusiasm of farmers to increase sweet potato production.
	Another situation that should attract the attention of all localities. That is, in some areas, although the area planted with sweet potatoes is not small, most of them are planted in poor land, and they are unwilling to use good land to plant sweet potatoes; at the same time, they do not pay enough attention to the processing and fertilization of sweet potatoes. Often, grain fields are fertilized more, and sweet potatoes are fertilized less or even not at all. These are all unfair treatments to sweet potatoes. Since sweet potatoes are a high-yield crop, why not plant them in good land? Why not process and fertilize them more? This is actually still the idea of ​​underestimating sweet potatoes at work. Therefore, we must raise the status of sweet potatoes, not only plant more, but also use good land to plant, process more, and fertilize more, so as to ensure that sweet potato production will increase even more.

### 让山药蛋和粮食“平起平坐”

    让山药蛋和粮食“平起平坐”
    3月1日的山西日报以“让山药蛋和粮食‘平起平坐’”为题发表社论，说明应该重视山药蛋（即马铃薯，下同）的生产。
    社论说：山药蛋是山西省著名的农产品之一。近几年来，山药蛋产量，虽然有所增长，但仍不能满足人们的需要。这一方面是由于严重灾害的袭击，另一方面也是由于人们对增产山药蛋还不十分重视。有些地方存在着这样一种风气，认为种山药蛋不如种粮食，甚至把吃山药蛋也当成不光彩的事情。这是对山药蛋的大不公平，是对高产作物的大不尊敬。因此，我们在这里要大声疾呼：提高山药蛋的地位，使山药蛋和粮食平起平坐！
    社论说：所以要为山药蛋争地位、取光荣，这是因为山药蛋是一种高产作物，一亩平常山药蛋，就可以产到二千斤左右，较一般粮田的产量要高得多。如果培育得好，产量还可大大提高，如宁武天井沟张三仁1953年每亩山药蛋即已产到一万零三百六十斤。今年山西省计划种植五百多万亩山药蛋，如果这五百万亩能够收获一百亿斤山药蛋的话，它将大大改变粮食的供应情况，改善城乡人民的生活。对更好地解决粮食问题，保证和促进整个社会主义建设，具有重大的政治意义。因为山药蛋不仅是一种可口的蔬菜，而且可以制造出多种多样的主食品、副食品。譬如以山药蛋粉掺上少许的面粉，既可以蒸馒头，又可以吃面条。只要想想办法，便能把山药蛋由副食品的地位，提高到主食品的地位。它含有糖类、蛋白质及其它对人类极为重要的营养料，它的热值每市斤含有五百五十四千卡，比大部分粮种毫无逊色。有些人耽心山药蛋营养价值不高，实际是没有根据的。此外，山药蛋粉渣还可以造酒、造醋、造酱。山药蛋淀粉，还是国防工业和制造药品的原料，并可以组织出口，换取钢材等重要物资。
    社论说：山药蛋的产量是这么高，用途是这么广。但是，有些人对种植山药蛋还有顾虑，比如怕种得多了，国家不统购，不能调剂生活；怕无法加工，难于保管；怕运输不出去等等。对这些问题，中共山西省委和省人民委员会在关于大量增产薯类的联合指示中已提出了具体的解决办法。只要充分教育群众、发动群众，这些问题都是可以完满解决的。
    社论指出：为了保证山药蛋的大跃进，各地必须广泛宣传山药蛋的优越性，使人们更加喜爱它——种它、吃它，并要加强对山药蛋的技术指导，使其产得更多更好。同时，当地政府在价格政策上、运输、保管、加工上，亦应采取必要的措施，及早准备解决由于山药蛋大量增产后可能产生的一系列问题，以提高农民增产山药蛋的积极性。
    还有一种情况应当引起各地的注意。这就是在一些地区，虽然种植山药蛋的面积不小，但大部分都种在赖地里，不肯用好地种山药蛋；同时，对山药蛋的加工、加肥也重视不够，往往是粮田上肥多，山药蛋上肥少、甚至不上肥。这些都是对山药蛋的不公平待遇。既然山药蛋是高产作物，为什么不种在好地里呢？为什么不多加工加肥呢？这实际上还是轻视山药蛋的思想在作怪。因此，我们要提高山药蛋的地位，不仅要多种，而且要用好地种、多加工、多加肥，如此才能保证山药蛋更多地增产。
