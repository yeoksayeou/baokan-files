Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 20th: The Soviet government has delivered a memorandum to the West German government regarding its recent statement insisting on discussing the German question at a high-level meeting. The memorandum points out that the Soviet government firmly opposes the suggestion of discussing German reunification at a high-level meeting, because this task can only be resolved by those who hope to unite the two Germanys themselves. If the Federal Government still insists on discussing German reunification at a high-level meeting, this can only be regarded as an attempt to complicate the convening of the meeting, thereby delaying the resolution of the German question.

The memorandum states that the Soviet government hopes that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany will once again carefully consider the serious consequences that its current attitude towards convening a high-level meeting may cause, and hopes that it can make a constructive contribution to preparing for and ensuring the success of this meeting.

The Soviet government's memorandum was delivered to West German Chancellor Adenauer on March 19th by Soviet Ambassador to West Germany, Smirnov.

The memorandum states that the Soviet government considers it necessary to state its views on the statement issued by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on March 15 regarding the suggestion to discuss the German question at a high-level meeting. The Soviet government maintains that the participants in the high-level meeting should concentrate on solving the most urgent international issues where agreement is already possible, such as: an immediate halt to the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free and rocket-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and the reduction of foreign troops stationed in Germany and other countries, etc. The Soviet government's starting point is that solving the above problems would lay a good foundation for mutual understanding between countries and would prepare conditions for resolving international disputes where the attitudes of the countries concerned are still far apart. The Soviet government also expressed its agreement to discuss other suggestions put forward by other countries during the preparatory meeting.

The memorandum states that, on the other hand, the Soviet government, in its official documents and in the conversations that the Soviet Ambassador to Bonn had with the Federal Chancellor and the Foreign Minister on behalf of the Soviet government, has drawn the Federal Government's attention to the fact that attempting to submit the German question to a high-level meeting for discussion can only create obstacles to the convening of the high-level meeting. The Soviet government understands with sympathy the wishes expressed by the Germans, and therefore suggested to the United States and other Western governments that, in addition to the series of issues originally proposed, the drafting and signing of a peace treaty with Germany should also be included in the meeting agenda. The Soviet government put forward this suggestion on the basis that the work of drafting a peace treaty with Germany could give the German people a clear prospect for the future development of Germany and could promote the joint efforts of the two Germanys to restore the national and state unity of the German people.

The German people have been looking forward to a peace treaty for almost thirteen years. Because everyone knows that the issue of a peace treaty with Germany is the issue of finally eliminating the consequences of the war, of determining the military conditions and some political and economic conditions that can enable Germany's development to be free from any external interference and enable Germany's territory to be free from foreign troops.

The memorandum states that, regrettably, the Federal Government has adopted an ambiguous and, in essence, completely negative attitude towards the suggestion of drafting a treaty, and has adopted the same attitude towards many other suggestions regarding the convening of a meeting of high-level leaders of various countries, especially those directly related to West Germany.

Some officials of the Federal Republic of Germany have gone so far as to distort the meaning of the Soviet suggestion. For example, they insist that the Soviet government advocates concluding two peace treaties, that is, concluding a peace treaty with each Germany. In order to avoid the continued spread of rumors in the future, the Soviet government considers it necessary to reiterate that it advocates concluding a peace treaty with the whole of Germany. It believes that the proposal of the German Democratic Republic on the establishment of a German Confederation provides the most realistic possibility for this. However, the Soviet government has no intention of forcing others to accept certain solutions to the German question. On the contrary, if a decision is made that representatives from the two Germanys, produced through consultation, should participate in the signing of the peace treaty, the Soviet government would consider it a matter of course. In other words, the Germans themselves should find possibilities to enable the two Germanys to become another party, in terms of national law, to sign the peace treaty with the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and other contracting states.

As for the issue of absorbing German representatives with corresponding full powers to participate in the negotiations on the initial stage of drafting the peace treaty, then this is certainly not a question of the Federal Republic of Germany recognizing the German Democratic Republic, or the German Democratic Republic recognizing the Federal Republic of Germany, but rather that the interests of both Germanys should also be well taken into account at this stage.

The memorandum points out that the Federal Government's negative attitude towards the German unification issue and the discussion of the peace treaty with Germany at a high-level meeting shows that, as in the past, it does not want to seek ways to unite Germany, but rather leaves the discussion of this issue, which is primarily a domestic affair of Germany, to others, that is, to the four great powers. However, many years of experience have proven that anyone who spreads illusions, making people feel that German unification can be achieved without the two Germanys approaching each other and reaching mutual understanding, and that there are roundabout routes to follow, is not doing good for the German people.

The Federal Government apparently does not want to seriously study the suggestion of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, so it is colluding with the same people as in March 1952: those who opposed the draft of the Soviet Union's proposed basis for a peace treaty with Germany at that time, but who have never put forward a suggestion on the content of a peace treaty during the entire post-war period.

The memorandum states that whenever a realistic possibility of promoting the resolution of the German question arises, a force gains the upper hand in West Germany, a force that tries to eliminate the possibility that has emerged, to bring things to a standstill, in order to obstruct the easing of international tensions and to follow the dangerous path of war preparations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The Federal Government is also trying its best to prevent the resolution of the most important modern issues involving the interests of all countries, such as disarmament, artificially linking the German unification issue with the disarmament issue. It is attempting to make the resolution of the disarmament issue and the adoption of certain measures to strengthen peace in Europe dependent on the German unification issue. In order to please certain non-European figures, the Federal Government has agreed to come forward as the vanguard, setting up various obstacles to obstruct the convening of a high-level meeting. This approach cannot but arouse the condemnation of the people of all countries who long to safeguard lasting peace.

### 苏联政府发出备忘录  谴责西德故意阻挠高级会议  重申坚决反对在会议上讨论德国统一问题

    苏联政府发出备忘录
    谴责西德故意阻挠高级会议
    重申坚决反对在会议上讨论德国统一问题
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科20日讯：苏联政府就西德政府最近发表声明硬要高级会议讨论德国问题这件事，向西德政府递交了一份备忘录。备忘录中指出，苏联政府坚决反对关于在高级会议上讨论德国统一问题的建议，因为这一任务除了希望统一两个德国的人自己以外，谁也不能解决。如果联邦政府仍旧主张在高级会议上讨论德国统一问题，那么这只能认为是企图使会议的召开复杂化，从而拖延德国问题的解决。
    备忘录说，苏联政府希望，德意志联邦共和国政府再一次慎重考虑它现在对召开高级会议的态度所可能造成的严重后果，并且希望它能够对筹备和保证这次会议成功作出建设性的贡献。
    苏联政府的备忘录是苏联驻西德大使斯米尔诺夫在3月19日交给西德总理阿登纳的。
    这个备忘录说，苏联政府认为有必要就德意志联邦共和国政府3月15日发表的关于建议高级会议讨论德国问题的声明，陈述自己的看法。苏联政府主张，高级会议参加者应该集中精力解决最迫切的、已经有可能达成协议的国际问题，例如：立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器，在中欧建立无原子武器和无火箭武器地区，裁减驻在德国和其他国家境内的外国军队人数等等。苏联政府的出发点是，解决上述问题会给各国间的相互谅解奠定良好基础，会给解决那些有关国家的态度距离尚远的国际争端准备条件。苏联政府还表示同意在会议上讨论其他国家在筹备会议期间提出的一些建议。
    备忘录说，另一方面，苏联政府在自己的正式文件中以及在苏联驻波恩大使受苏联政府的委托同联邦总理和外交部长进行的谈话中，都曾经提请联邦政府注意：企图把德国问题提交高级会议讨论，只能给高级会议的召开制造障碍。苏联政府怀着同情的心情理解到德国人所表示的愿望，因此向美国和其他西方国家政府建议，除了原先提出的一系列问题外，再把起草和签订对德和约的问题列入会议议程。苏联政府提出这个建议的出发点是，起草对德和约的工作可以使德国人民对未来德国的发展有一个明确的前景，并且可以推动两个德国共同致力于恢复德国人民的民族和国家统一的事业。
    德国人民盼望和约差不多已经有十三年了。因为大家知道，对德和约问题是最后消除战争后果的问题，是确定那些能使德国的发展不受任何外来干涉、能使德国的领土不再有外国军队驻扎的军事条件和部分的政治及经济条件的问题。
    备忘录说，遗憾的是，联邦政府采取了模棱两可而实质上是完全否定的态度来对待起草和约的建议，并且以同样的态度来对待关于召开各国高级领导人会议的许多其他建议，特别是那些直接涉及西德的建议。
    德意志联邦共和国的某些官方人士不惜歪曲苏联建议的意思，例如，他们硬说，苏联政府主张缔结两个和约，即同每一个德国各缔结一个和约。为了避免今后继续产生谣言，苏联政府认为有必要重申：它是主张同整个德国缔结和约的。它认为，德意志民主共和国政府关于建立德国邦联的建议为此提供了一种最现实的可能性。但是，苏联政府丝毫不想强迫别人接受某些解决德国问题的方案。相反，如果作出决定在签订和约时应有两个德国协商产生的代表参加，苏联政府会认为是理所当然的事。换句话说，德国人自己应该寻找可能性，以使两个德国在国家法方面能够成为同苏联、美国、英国、法国和其他缔约国签署和约的另一方。
    至于吸收具有相应全权的德国代表参加关于草拟和约的最初阶段的谈判问题，那末，这当然不是什么要德意志联邦共和国承认德意志民主共和国或者要德意志民主共和国承认德意志联邦共和国的问题，而是说，就是在这个阶段也应当很好地考虑到两个德国的利益。
    备忘录指出，联邦政府在德国统一问题以及关于在高级会议上讨论对德和约问题所抱的否定态度表明了，它仍然同过去一样，不想去寻求统一德国的途径，而是把对这个首先是属于德国内政的问题的讨论交给别人，也就是交给四个大国。但是，许多年来的经验证明，谁如果散布幻想，使人感到要统一德国可以不必通过两个德国互相接近和取得相互谅解的途径，而有什么迂回的道路可循，那末谁就不是在给德国人民做好事。
    联邦政府显然不希望认真研究关于缔结对德和约的建议，所以它和1952年3月一样，在同这样一些人串通一气：这些人当时曾反对苏联提出的对德和约基础草案，而自己在整个战后期间却一直没有提出关于和约内容的建议。
    备忘录说，每当出现推动德国问题解决的现实可能性时，在西德就有一股势力占上风，这股势力力图消灭所出现的可能性，使事情陷入僵局，以便阻挠国际紧张局势缓和，并沿着北大西洋公约组织危险的备战道路走去。
    联邦政府还企图竭力阻止解决像裁军这样涉及一切国家利益的现代最重要的问题，人为地把德国统一问题与裁军问题扯在一起。企图使裁军问题和采取一定措施加强欧洲和平的问题的解决取决于德国统一问题。联邦政府为了讨好某些非欧洲人士而同意出面打头阵，布置下种种障碍来阻挠高级会议的召开。这种做法不能不引起渴望保障持久和平的各国人民的谴责。
