Soil Used as Cable, Plastic Made into Springs

    Swedish scientists have successfully researched a method of using soil to replace ordinary telephone cables.
    By injecting a small strip of land with a specialized salt solution, it becomes an excellent conductor of electricity. If a layer of sand is spread over the soil, this "cable" is not easily damaged.
    The United States has successfully researched a method of using oxides and polyether resins to manufacture springs. Adding a layer of glass fiber to the spring material can increase the spring's toughness. This plastic spring has many advantages: it is non-magnetic, non-conductive, and does not conduct heat, and it is much lighter than metal springs of the same toughness.
    The manufacturing process of this spring is very simple: it only needs to go through one process to be completely "cast" into the desired shape. This spring has no internal stress, so it does not need to be heat treated, and it can work at temperatures from minus twenty degrees Celsius to plus seventy degrees Celsius. (Xinhua News Agency)

    土地作电缆　塑料制弹簧
    瑞典的科学家已研究成功用土地来代替普通电话电缆的方法。
    把一小条土地注以专门的盐溶液，它就变成最好的导电体。如在土地上面撒上一层砂子，这种“电缆”就不易损坏。
    美国已经研究成功用一种氧化物和聚醚等类松脂来制造弹簧的方法。在弹簧的材料中加进玻璃纤维的夹层，就可增加弹簧的韧性。这种塑料弹簧有许多优点：不带磁性，不导电，不传热，比韧性相同的金属弹簧轻得多。
    这种弹簧的制造过程很简单：它只要经过一次工序就可以完全“铸成”需要的形状。这种弹簧没有内应力，所以不需要进行热处理，它可以在摄氏零下二十度到零上七十度的温度下工作。（新华社）
