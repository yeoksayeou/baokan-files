    Turning the Advanced Producers' Production Level into the Production Level of the Whole Society
    Our newspaper publishes today the news of the Ministry of Railways' plan to increase production and practice economy by 450 million yuan this year. This is an encouraging piece of good news amidst the nationwide great leap forward! The Ministry of Railways' plan for increasing production and practicing economy was put forward after studying the advanced example of the Beijing Railway Administration, referring to the advanced indicators of the Shanghai and Jinzhou Railway Administrations, and analyzing and comparing the railway enterprises across the country. It is a general mobilization order to organize railway enterprises across the country to leap forward to advanced levels.
    Not long ago, we successively published news about the Beijing Railway Administration, the Shanghai Railway Administration, and the Jinzhou Railway Administration opposing conservatism, tapping potential, and making a great leap forward. In these news reports, people saw how huge the potential of railway transportation and railway construction was, and how boldly the advanced railway enterprises and railway workers were leaping forward. One national plan target after another was left behind; you plan to reach one million tons of kilometers per day with locomotives during the Second Five-Year Plan, he guarantees to do it within half a year, a year at most, and actually does it in just over two months; you require basic construction to save 10% of investment, he guarantees to save 18%. What an astonishing leap forward! However, while people are rejoicing over these leap forward news, they cannot help but think of another question: if the Beijing, Shanghai, and Jinzhou Railway Administrations can do it, can other railway administrations do it? If all the railway administrations across the country could tap their potential like these three railway administrations, how much of a leap forward would the railway work make!
    Today, the Ministry of Railways' plan for increasing production and practicing economy answers this question for people: what the Beijing and other railway administrations can do, the Ministry of Railways must help and supervise other railway administrations to do. The plan to increase production and practice economy by 450 million yuan is based on organizing all enterprises to learn from advanced enterprises and catch up with advanced enterprises. In the Ministry of Railways' plan for increasing production and practicing economy, we see that the planned targets once proposed by advanced units have now become the common goals of railway enterprises across the country. The task of the Ministry of Railways is to grasp the advanced to promote the overall situation, and to be a promoting department rather than a deterring department. According to this plan, using existing equipment, and even reducing more than 10,000 employees, it can complete 20 million tons more of transport tasks and increase revenue by 120 million yuan. This is truly a vivid example of grasping the advanced to lead the general.
    The Ministry of Railways can do this, why can't other ministries do this?! The advanced experience of the Ministry of Railways is a powerful challenge to other ministries of the Central Government. We expect to see the responses of other industrial and transportation departments immediately.
    The advanced planned targets proposed by advanced enterprises and advanced producers, and the advanced production levels they have created, have always been warmly welcomed in our country. This is because the advanced planned targets proposed by advanced enterprises and advanced producers, and the advanced production levels they have created, are the prelude to the leap forward of the entire social production level. Their indicators and their experiences have opened up the road forward for those who come later. Every ordinary enterprise and ordinary producer who learns their drive and experience has the potential to leap to their level, thereby improving the entire social production. One flower cannot make a spring, and the production level of one advanced person does not equal the production level of the whole society; the blooming of hundreds of flowers is spring, and the catching up of thousands of enterprises is the improvement of social production. However, turning the production level of the advanced into the production level of the whole society also requires organization and leadership. Without organization and leadership, the improvement of social production will be much slower. We often say that the socialist system is much superior to the capitalist system. The fundamental reason is that the socialist system can develop productive forces at a much faster rate than the capitalist system, and can improve the social production level at a much faster rate than the capitalist system. Under the socialist system, all advanced science, technology and production experience are the wealth of the whole people. It can be quickly disseminated most widely, thereby rapidly improving the social production level. The serious task of economic work departments is to enthusiastically support the initiatives of advanced producers, do everything possible to help them achieve advanced planned targets and create advanced production levels; at the same time, actively promote the experience of advanced producers, organize all enterprises and all producers to catch up with the level of advanced enterprises and advanced producers, and turn the production level of a few advanced people into the production level of the whole society as soon as possible. The emergence of all advanced production levels will inevitably break the old balance and stir up new waves in life. However, this is intolerable for those who are blindly arrogant and only see achievements, but do not see shortcomings and potential, or for those who only see difficulties and are pessimistic and lifeless. Didn't Zhejiang once cut off 15,000 agricultural cooperatives? This was a matter of a few years ago, and could have been omitted. But people have not always learned lessons from this. The peasants want to take the road of collectivization, but we have cut off 15,000 agricultural cooperatives. This is not a trivial matter, but a major event in the political life of the country. Every cadre should think about what this is a problem of? Whether there have been such problems in their own work? Unfortunately, some people have only heard of such a thing, but have not thought about it carefully. Take the railway department, for example, haven't similar things happened? An important indicator on the railway is called locomotive daily mileage, which refers to the average number of miles a locomotive travels per day. A high locomotive daily mileage indicates that the same locomotive can achieve higher efficiency and haul more things. In 1952, the Ministry of Railways averaged 396 kilometers per locomotive per day, which is rare in the world. See, this is such a good thing! However, perhaps it was too good! Someone began to doubt it for no reason, found various reasons to suppress this indicator, and did not allow it to be so high. As a result, by 1957, the average locomotive only ran 366 kilometers per day. Such things are not just one. Hasn't the "full load, over-axis, 500-kilometer movement" also had several ups and downs? Why is it not moving forward bravely, with each wave higher than the last, but rising and falling, again and again? The reason is that the idea of promotion is not clear, and the idea of conservatism is too serious. When falling behind, they emphasize difficulties and do not rush forward; when walking in front, they become suspicious and retreat.
    A new invention and an advanced experience cannot all develop smoothly in our socialist society, but must go through a struggle. All economic work leading departments must completely oppose all kinds of conservative thinking and always be promoters in order to turn the production level of advanced people into the production level of the whole society. Now many enterprises, many cadres, and workers have asked themselves a question: "Are you a promoter or a deterrent?" This question is very necessary, and even more necessary for economic work leading departments. Now the Ministry of Railways has submitted a promoter's paper. Other ministries must also answer this exam paper: Are there any restrictive rules? What attitude do you take towards advanced things? Have you taken on the responsibility of turning the production level of advanced people into the production level of the whole society?
    The current timing is very good, the revolutionary drive is sufficient, heroes emerge in large numbers, and new planned targets and new production records are higher than the last. Under this upsurge situation, turning the production level of advanced people into the production level of the whole society is much more favorable than at any time in the past. In the past, we also emphasized the promotion of advanced experience and did a lot of work, especially after the advanced producer movement was launched in 1956, the achievements were even more significant. However, as it seems now, the past learning of advanced experience was relatively fragmented, and among the advanced experience promoted in the past, there were more technical experiences between types of work, and cadres, especially leading cadres, had a lot of lifelessness. The current situation is very different. The current revolutionary drive cannot be compared with the past. Not only is the drive of the masses great, but the drive of the leaders is also great. The advanced experience we have now is also much richer and more complete than in the past. It is not only of individual types of work, but also of all aspects of the entire industry; not only technical, but also in leadership methods. This universal revolutionary drive and rich advanced experience provide very favorable conditions for the improvement of the entire social production level. We hope that all departments will take on the responsibility of organizing the great leap forward, seize advanced models, formulate their own plans for increasing production and practicing economy, and organize all enterprises to leap forward to advanced production levels!

### 把先进者的生产水平变为全社会的生产水平

    把先进者的生产水平变为全社会的生产水平
    本报今天发表铁道部今年计划增产节约四亿五千万元的消息。这是全国范围跃进声中一个振奋人心的喜讯！铁道部的增产节约计划，是在研究了北京铁路管理局这个先进典型，参考了上海和锦州两个铁路管理局的先进指标，对全国各个铁路企业作了分析和比较，然后提出来的。它是一个组织全国铁路企业向先进水平跃进的总动员令。
    不久以前，我们曾连续发表了北京铁路管理局、上海铁路管理局和锦州铁路管理局反保守、挖潜力、大跃进的消息。人们在这些消息中，看到了铁路运输和铁路建设的潜力是多么巨大，看到了先进的铁路企业和铁路职工正迈着多么豪放的大步向前跃进。一项项国家计划指标被抛在后面了；你打算在第二个五年计划内达到机车日产百万吨公里，他保证半年，一年内一定做到，并且实际上两个多月就做到了；你要求基本建设节约投资10％。他保证节约18％。这是多么惊人的跃进啊！然而，人们在为这些跃进的消息欢欣鼓舞的同时，也不能不联想到另外一个问题：北京、上海和锦州铁路管理局能够做到的，别的铁路管理局能不能做到呢？如果全国各个铁路管理局都能像这三个铁路管理局一样地挖掘潜力，铁路工作该有多么大的跃进啊！
    今天，铁道部的增产节约计划回答了人们的这个问题：北京等铁路管理局能够做到的，铁道部一定要帮助和督促别的铁路管理局都能做到。增产节约四亿五千万元的计划，就是建立在组织全体企业向先进企业学习、赶上先进企业的基础上的。在铁道部的增产节约计划中，我们看到曾经是先进单位提出的计划指标，现在变为全国铁路企业共同的奋斗目标了。铁道部的任务就是抓住先进推动全局，做促进部不做促退部。根据这个计划，利用原有的设备，而且还要减少一万多个职工，却能多完成两千万吨运输任务，多增加一亿二千万元收入。这真是一个抓住先进带动一般的生动的榜样。
    铁道部能够这样做，其他部为什么不能这样做？！铁道部的先进经验是对中央其他各部的一个有力的挑战。我们期望立即看到其他各工业交通部门的回答。
    先进企业和先进生产者所提出的先进的计划指标，他们所创造的先进的生产水平，在我们的国家里从来就受到最热烈的欢迎。这是因为先进企业和先进生产者所提出的先进的计划指标，他们所创造的先进的生产水平，是整个社会生产水平跃进的先声。他们的指标，他们的经验，为后来者开辟了前进的道路。每一个普通企业和普通生产者学习他们的干劲和经验，都有可能跃上他们的水平，从而使整个社会生产提高。一朵鲜花打扮不出春天的景色，一个先进者的生产水平不等于整个社会的生产水平；百花争艳才是春，千万个企业都赶上来才是社会生产的提高。但是，要把先进者的生产水平变为全社会的生产水平，还需要组织和领导。没有组织和领导，社会生产的提高要慢得多。我们常说社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越得多，其原因归根到底，就在于社会主义制度能够使生产力以比资本主义制度快得多的速度发展，能够使社会生产水平以比资本主义制度快得多的速度提高。在社会主义制度下，一切先进的科学技术和生产经验，都是全民的财富。它可以迅速得到最广泛的传播，从而使社会生产水平迅速提高。经济工作部门的严重任务，就是要满怀热情地支持先进生产者的创举，千方百计地帮助他们实现先进的计划指标，创造先进的生产水平；同时积极推广先进生产者的经验，组织全体企业和全体生产者赶上先进企业和先进生产者的水平，使少数先进者的生产水平尽快地变成全社会的生产水平。一切先进生产水平的出现，都必然打破旧的平衡，在生活中激起新的浪花。然而，这对于那些只看见成绩、看不见缺点、看不见潜力的盲目自大的人，或者是对于那些只看见困难，看不见积极因素的暮气沉沉的“悲观论者”说来，却是看不惯的。浙江不是曾经砍掉一万五千个农业合作社吗？这是几年前的事了，本可以不提。但是人们并没有时时从这里吸取教训。农民要走合作化的道路，而我们砍掉了一万五千个农业合作社，这不是一件小事，而是国家政治生活中的一件大事。每一个干部都应该想一想，这是一个什么问题？自己的工作中是否也有过这样的问题？可惜的是，有些人只听说有过这么一件事，却没有去仔细地想一想。就拿铁路部门来说吧，类似的事情又何尝没有呢？铁路上有一个很重要的指标，叫作机车日车公里，指的是平均每台机车每天走多少里路。机车日车公里的指标高，表明同样一台机车可以发挥更高的效率，多拉好多东西。1952年，铁道部平均每台机车每天跑三百九十六公里，这在世界各国都是少有的。看，这是多么好的一件事情！然而，也许是太好了吧！有人却无缘无故地对它怀疑起来，找出各种各样的理由把这个指标压下去，不许这么高。于是，到1957年，平均每台机车每天就只跑三百六十六公里。这样的事情不只一件。“满载、超轴、五百公里运动”不是也曾有过几起几落吗？为什么不是勇往直前’一浪更比一浪高，而是起而又落、一而再、再而三呢？原因就是促进的思想不明确、保守的思想太严重。掉在后面的时候，强调困难，不往前赶；走在前面的时候，又发生怀疑，退了下来。
    一个新的发明，一个先进经验，在我们社会主义社会中也并不是通通能够顺利发展的，而是要经过一番奋斗的。一切经济工作领导部门要把先进者的生产水平变为全社会的生产水平，就必须彻底地反掉各式各样的保守思想，永远做一个促进派。现在有许多企业，许多干部和工人都出了一个题目问自己：“是促进派、还是促退派”？这一问很有必要，对经济工作领导部门更有必要。现在铁道部交了一份促进派的卷子。别的部也要来答一下这个试卷：有没有清规戒律？对先进事物采取什么态度？是不是负起了把先进者的生产水平变为全社会的生产水平的责任？
    现在的时机很好，革命干劲足，英雄辈出，新的计划指标和新的生产纪录一个高过一个。在这种高潮的形势下，把先进者的生产水平变为全社会的生产水平，要比过去任何时候有利得多。过去，我们也强调过推广先进经验，做过许多工作，特别是1956年先进生产者运动开展以后，成绩更加显著。但是，现在看来，过去学先进经验还比较零碎，过去推广的先进经验中，以工种之间的技术经验为较多，干部特别是领导干部有许多暮气。现在的情况大不相同了。现在的革命干劲是过去不能比拟的，不只是群众的干劲大，领导的干劲也大。现在我们已有的先进经验也比过去丰富得多，完整得多，不只是个别工种的、而且有整个产业各个方面的；不只是技术上的，而且有领导方法上的。这种普遍的革命干劲和丰富的先进经验，为整个社会生产水平的提高提供了十分有利的条件。我们希望各个部门都把组织大跃进的责任担负起来，抓住先进典型，订出自己的增产节约计划，组织全体企业向先进的生产水平跃进！
