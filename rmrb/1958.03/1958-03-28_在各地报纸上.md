In Local Newspapers

    Valuable Experience
    The leadership of the Nanning Brick and Tile Factory created the "Five Sides" method during the Double-Anti Movement. By using this method, they both followed the mass line well and conducted in-depth leadership. The Guangxi Daily on the 22nd introduced their approach. The "Five Sides" include: simultaneously encouraging everyone to write big-character posters; simultaneously mobilizing the criticized units and individuals to read the posters; simultaneously leading discussions and self-criticism; simultaneously delving into rectification and formulating measures; and simultaneously publicizing the improved methods. According to reports, using this method for rectification is both fast and effective, truly unleashing the power of big-character posters and boosting everyone's enthusiasm.
    
    Intensive Preparations for Spring Plowing
    The New China Daily on the 25th led its front page with the headline "Taicang and Jintan Intensively Preparing for Spring Plowing," reporting that these two counties were earnestly resolving issues such as rice seeds, seedbeds, and farm tools in order to achieve "doubling rice production." Taicang County decided to fully mobilize the masses to solve the rice seed shortage and instructed the grain departments to comprehensively inspect grain depots and temporarily lend a portion of rice grains to agricultural cooperatives based on need. Measures were also taken to address issues such as expanding seedbeds and improving and adding weeding tools due to dense planting. Jintan County also carried out various preparations for spring plowing centered around dense planting. The same newspaper published a commentator's article, urging all localities to immediately conduct a comprehensive inspection of spring plowing and sowing preparations while vigorously cultivating three kinds of wheat.
    
    Investigating and Analyzing Soil Properties
    In order to achieve its production increase plan, the Qin'an County Committee of Gansu Province not only adopted measures such as building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, and intercropping, but also organized forces to investigate and analyze the properties of various soils throughout the county. Through the investigation, they determined which crops were suitable for planting in which areas and found ways to improve the soil. The county committee also called on cadres throughout the county to diligently study soil science in the process of managing experimental fields, transforming themselves from laymen into experts. The Gansu Daily prominently reported Qin'an's practices on the 22nd. The editor's note pointed out that understanding the properties of the soil is a fundamental measure for achieving agricultural production increases. The newspaper suggested that other places could emulate Qin'an's practices.
    
    A Measure to Increase Rapeseed Production
    In field management, one important measure to promote rapeseed production that has rarely been noticed is artificial pollination of rapeseed. The Qianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Wan'an Township, Shiqian County, Guizhou Province, conducted an artificial pollination experiment last year, increasing rapeseed production by 12% to 15% per mu. This year, they are universally carrying out artificial pollination on their 641 mu of rapeseed, estimating that they can harvest more than 14,000 jin of rapeseed. The pollination method is very simple: one person uses a smooth bamboo pole about one and a half zhang long, holding the middle of the pole with both hands, and sweeping it horizontally across the rapeseed rows after the dew has dried, causing the rapeseed to be pollinated by the vibration of the bamboo pole. An average female laborer can pollinate 30 to 40 mu within ten hours. When reporting this news on the 22nd, the Guizhou Daily published a short commentary, considering it an important avenue for increasing production.
    
    Rice-Paddy Fish Farming: Multiple Benefits in One Stroke
    The Anhui Daily reported on the 23rd that the Anhui Provincial Aquatic Products Work Conference had formulated a five-year aquatic product plan and this year's aquatic product plan. According to the plan, 339,000 tons of fish will be produced this year, and 2,030,000 tons of fish will be produced in 1962. An important measure to achieve this plan is to promote rice-paddy fish farming. The same newspaper introduced the experience of the Huadameng Agricultural Cooperative in Chaoxian County in rice-paddy fish farming. Last year, this cooperative raised carp in 31.8 mu of rice paddies, averaging more than 173 jin of fish per mu, increasing fishery income by more than 1,300 yuan. Not only that, but fish manure can also fertilize the fields, and fish eat rice borers and other pests, and the movement of fish in the water loosens the soil, which promotes rice production, with rice paddies that raise fish producing an average of 52 jin more grain per mu than those that do not raise fish.

    Collective Chicken Raising: Great Potential
    The Guizhou Daily published a piece of fresh news on the 19th: The Quanshan Agricultural Cooperative in Weining Autonomous County invested 1,500 yuan and a small amount of labor last year to collectively raise 36,000 chickens, generating an income of 12,400 yuan, accounting for 18.75% of agricultural income. Approximately 300,000 jin of chicken manure were accumulated throughout the year, providing strong support for agricultural production. The newspaper published a short commentary on this matter, believing that treating chicken raising as a collective sideline of the agricultural cooperative has great potential. The short commentary said that while developing collective chicken raising, it is also necessary to encourage and promote individual chicken raising by commune members. On the same day, the newspaper also reported that 364 agricultural cooperatives in Bijie County plan to start a chicken farm in each cooperative this year without spending a penny or using a single grain of food, and introduced the experience of Zhou Hexuan, a farmer in the county, in feeding chickens and ducks entirely without grain.

    可贵的经验
    南宁砖瓦厂的领导方面，在双反运动中创造了“五边”方法，运用这种方法，他们既很好地走了群众路线，又进行了深入的领导。22日的广西日报介绍了他们的做法。“五边”的内容，就是一边促进大家写大字报；一边发动被批评的单位和个人去看大字报；一边领导讨论检查；一边深入整改订出措施；一边就把改进办法公布出来。据报道，采用这种方法进行整改，既快又好，真正发挥了大字报的威力，鼓舞了大家的积极性。
    密锣紧鼓准备春耕
    25日新华日报一版头条以“太仓、金坛密锣紧鼓准备春耕”为题，报道这两个县为了实现“水稻翻一番”，认真解决稻种、秧田、农具等问题。太仓县决定全力发动群众解决稻种困难，并责成粮食部门全面检查粮库，根据需要暂借一部分稻谷给农业社。对于因密植而带来的扩大秧田、改进和添置耘耥农具等问题，也都采取措施加以解决。金坛县也围绕密植进行了各项备耕工作。同日报纸发表了评论员文章，要求各地在大力培植三麦的同时，立即对春耕春播准备工作做一次大检查。
    调查分析土壤性能
    甘肃秦安县委为了实现增产计划，除采取兴修水利、积肥和间种、套种等措施外，还组织力量，在全县范围内调查分析了各种土壤性能。经过调查，摸到了哪些地区适宜于种植哪样作物的底，找到了改良土壤的途径。县委还号召全县干部在搞试验田的过程中认真钻研土壤学，由外行变成内行。22日甘肃日报二版显著地报道了秦安的做法。编者按语中指出，摸清土壤的性能是实现农业增产的一项根本措施。报纸建议其他地方也能仿效秦安的做法。
    一个增产油菜的措施
    在田间管理中，有一项促进油菜丰产的重要措施，一向很少人注意，就是油菜实行人工授粉。贵州石阡县万安乡前锋农业社去年做过人工授粉的试验，使每亩油菜子的产量增加了12％到15％。今年他们的六百四十一亩油菜都普遍进行人工授粉，估计可多收一万四千多斤油菜子。授粉办法很简单，即一人用一根一丈五尺左右长的光滑竹杆，双手拿住竹杆中间，在露雨晒干后往油菜行里横过，使油菜受竹杆震动而授粉。一个普通女劳动力十小时之内，就可授粉三十至四十亩。22日贵州日报二版报道这个消息时，发表了短评，认为这是一种重要的增产门路。
    稻田养鱼一举数得
    23日安徽日报报道了安徽省水产工作会议制定的五年水产规划和今年的水产规划。按照规划，今年将产鱼三十三万九千吨，1962年将产鱼二百零三万吨。实现这个规划的一项重要措施，是推广稻田养鱼。同日报纸介绍了巢县花大门农业社稻田养鱼的经验。这个社去年在三十一点八亩稻田里养了鲤鱼，平均每亩产鱼一百七十三斤多，增加了一千三百多元的渔业收入。不仅如此，鱼粪还可以肥田，鱼又吃食螟虫等害虫，鱼在水里活动又使泥土变松，这些促使水稻增产，每亩养鱼的稻田比不养鱼的平均多产了五十二斤粮食。
    集体养鸡大有可为
    贵州日报19日发表了一条内容新鲜的消息：威宁自治县泉山农业社去年花了一千五百元投资和少量劳力，集体养鸡三万六千只，收入达一万二千四百元，占农业收入的18.75％。全年约积鸡粪三十万斤，对农业生产也是有力的支持。报纸就这事发表了短评，认为把养鸡当作农业社的一项集体副业大有可为。短评说，在发展集体养鸡的同时，也要鼓励和提倡社员个人养鸡。同一天的报纸上，还报道了毕节县三百六十四个农业社今年计划不花一文钱、不用一粒粮食，每社开办一个养鸡场的消息，并介绍了这个县的农民周和宣喂养鸡鸭完全不用粮食的经验。
