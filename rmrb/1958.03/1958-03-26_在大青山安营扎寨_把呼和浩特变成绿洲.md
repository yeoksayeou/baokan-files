Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, March 25th: Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which suffers from wind and sand erosion every year, has seen its first batch of more than 2,000 afforestation workers set up camp in the Daqing Mountains in the suburbs. An unprecedented greening movement has begun. At the city's Greening Leap Forward Conference held on the 24th, many units stated that they would set up camp in Daqing Mountain and would not come down the mountain until the task was completed. The city's 200,000 residents will dedicate 270,000 voluntary labor days this year to planting trees and afforestation. In order to turn Hohhot into an oasis in Inner Mongolia as soon as possible, this year people of all ethnic groups will dig 6 million fish-scale pits on 2,500 hectares of barren hills and ridges in Daqing Mountain, plant 1.3 million trees in the urban area, afforest 300 hectares in the suburbs; and cultivate 400 hectares of young forests.

    在大青山安营扎寨
    把呼和浩特变成绿洲
    据新华社呼和浩特25日电年年遭受风沙侵袭的内蒙古自治区首府呼和浩特市，第一批两千多人的造林队伍已开到郊区大青山安营扎寨。空前规模的绿化运动开始了。在24日举行的全市绿化跃进大会上，许多单位纷纷表示，要上大青山安营扎寨，不完成任务誓不下山。市区二十万人口，今年将要献出二十七万个义务劳动日进行植树造林。为了使呼和浩特尽快变成内蒙古的绿洲，今年各族人民要在大青山二千五百公顷的荒山秃岭上，挖鱼鳞坑六百万个，在市区植树一百三十万株，郊区造林三百公顷；另外还抚育幼林四百公顷。
