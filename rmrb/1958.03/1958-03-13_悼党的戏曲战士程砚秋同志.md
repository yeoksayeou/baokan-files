Hearing the news of Comrade Cheng Yanqiu's serious illness at a panel meeting of the theatrical creation conference, I rushed to his home to learn about his condition and spoke with him by his bedside. He smiled and said, "According to yesterday's situation, I almost thought I was going to say goodbye to everyone." Immediately afterward, doctors from Beijing Hospital arrived, examined him, and immediately sent him to the hospital for examination. We watched him get into the car before returning, planning to visit him again in a few days.

But as I write this article, this outstanding theatrical artist of the Party, still in his prime, has already left us for three days. This is another major and irreplaceable loss for the Chinese theatrical world, following the passing of Mr. Wang Yaoqing, Mr. Shang Heyu, and Mr. Yang Baosen!

Comrade Cheng Yanqiu also learned opera due to poverty in his family. The clever young man quickly fell in love with this excellent traditional art after learning it. However, learning solely from old masters could hardly satisfy his desire for progress. He had ambition and courage; beyond technical practice, he independently studied culture. He liked to associate with senior figures in the literary and art circles and received their help. Mr. Chen Shutong and Mr. Luo Yingong were among those who contributed to his progress. Comrade Yanqiu also attached great importance to local operas. It is said that his skill with water sleeves, among other things, was influenced by the Jin opera performer "Water Floating."

Comrade Yanqiu was an artist with rich emotions and a firm fighting spirit. He was a typical Qingyi actor, and therefore, also an excellent tragic actor. His plays mainly depicted kind and virtuous Chinese women who, under unbearable persecution and slander, responded with deeply rooted, resilient, and unyielding actions to achieve ultimate victory. The heavy oppression of women in Chinese society also forged many noble qualities in Chinese women, and Comrade Yanqiu's art largely expressed these qualities. His representative work, "The Tears of the Wilderness," attacked the old society's oppressive government, which was fiercer than a tiger, while also offering a prayer for peace. The female protagonist's final lines in the play say, "I might as well risk death and beg heaven, wishing the nation eternal peace from now on." This represented the urgent desire of the suffering people at the time, although this wish could only be realized in today's era of the people. Another representative work, "Spring Boudoir Dream," used a story from the Three Kingdoms period to satirize the wives of the widowed and the children of the orphaned, as well as the conscription of men into the army. At the time, feudal warlords often lured people to fight for them with promises of promotion and wealth. Comrade Yanqiu used the female protagonist's voice to sing, "Rough tea and simple meals are better than a golden seal of office; I wish to spend my life together, cherishing me and cherishing you." When the Kuomintang launched the civil war, Comrade Yanqiu performed this play. A Kuomintang member from the Northeast Relief Committee said to him, "It would have been great if this play had been performed during the War of Resistance!" Comrade Yanqiu said sternly, "No, it couldn't be performed during the War of Resistance; it's better to perform it now."

Comrade Yanqiu was precisely such a principled and combative person. It was only natural that he later leaned towards the Party and joined it.

Comrade Yanqiu also performed new plays such as "The Green Frost Sword," "The Jade Hairpin," and "The Mandarin Duck Tomb," and after liberation, he performed "Yingtai's Resistance to Marriage," all of which were works that contributed to the democratic struggle. The old plays he performed, such as "Three Slaps on the Table" and "Dou E's Injustice," were also of this type. Certain content always demands a certain artistic form. Based on the oppressed personality of the female characters he chose and his own vocal conditions, Comrade Yanqiu created the melancholic and winding Cheng-style singing. This singing style, with its unique characteristics, was widely welcomed.

Comrade Yanqiu paid attention to opera education very early on. The China Opera School he founded cultivated four classes: Virtue, Harmony, Gold, and Jade. Many famous actors in today's Peking Opera world are mostly his students. He also went to Europe for observation and published his travelogue. After returning to China, he made some attempts to reform stage image and other aspects. In addition to his impressions of opera, he also published "A Glimpse of Directing in Spoken Drama" in the Journal of Dramatic Studies. He had a broad knowledge of drama.

Many people know that Comrade Yanqiu was a patriot. During the period when the Japanese puppets ran rampant, he and Mr. Mei Lanfang, Mr. Zhou Xinfang, and others all had excellent performances. He even fought head-on with enemy agents, farmed the land in Qinglongqiao, Jingxi, and refused to perform.

I personally had more contact with Comrade Yanqiu only in the early days of the liberation of Beijing. Before the People's Liberation Army entered Beijing, they had borrowed his house in Qinglongqiao. He was initially somewhat resistant and talked to me about it. After Beijing was liberated, he returned to Qinglongqiao and discovered that after the Liberation Army left, they had not taken away or damaged any of his belongings and had protected them very carefully. He then realized that there really was such an army of the people in the world, and that it was not like what he sang in "The Tears of the Wilderness": "Before your very eyes, a good village turns to ashes." This moved him deeply. Seeing the many wise measures taken after the city was liberated, he felt infinite affection and love for the Party, the people's government, and Chairman Mao.

In 1949, we went together to Prague via the Soviet Union to participate in the World Peace Congress. We were in the same carriage on the international train, and we talked a lot. He expressed, "My love for the Party is hard to express in words!"

While in Prague, Comrade Yanqiu's eldest son came from Belgium and helped him translate his speech into French.

During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Comrade Yanqiu and Mr. Mei, among others, braved heavy snow and crossed icy rivers to perform in the Korean war zone to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteers. Later, he also comforted the People's Liberation Army.

As a National People's Congress representative and vice president of the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera, he inspected and performed in the Northwest, Southwest, and Northeast regions many times. Comrade Zhou Yang wrote an open letter to him regarding his "A Brief Account of a Visit to Northwest Opera" in February 1950, highly praising his research plan and arguing that some friends in the Peking Opera world looked down on local operas, while he attached so much importance to them, which was worthy of everyone's study. He also agreed with his criticism of the opera world's blind worship of the West and disregard for national heritage, but believed that the truly moving part of the old operas lay precisely in their realism, and criticized him for not learning from the realistic methods of fraternal arts such as spoken drama and film. Because Comrade Yanqiu had an understanding of spoken drama and other arts, this shortcoming was later corrected.

Comrade Yanqiu had his unique perspectives on art, but he sometimes inevitably went to extremes. He fought alone for his art and career throughout his life, so he was often lonely and out of step with others. These shortcomings gradually and significantly changed after he accepted Marxism. He was previously unwilling to teach students, but in recent years, he not only taught classes at the China Opera Experimental School, enthusiastically cultivated several successors to him, but also gave advice on singing, gestures, and water sleeve techniques to famous actors from various places during the Shanxi and Sichuan performances, working hard and meticulously, sparing no effort. Recently, he fell ill, but the day before he entered the hospital, he went to the North Latitude Hotel to guide the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe's export program "A Hundred Flowers Presenting Swords."

Yanqiu was such a good comrade!

During the encoffining, I looked at the corners of his mouth with a hint of a smile, as if he wanted to say something. Why not? The Party and the people are expecting him to say many things, to sing many new songs, not melancholic and winding, but full of joyful and passionate singing!

The Party deeply mourns the death of this cultural warrior. Comrade Yanqiu was still in the probationary period, and the Party specially recognized him as a full member after his death.

Comrade Yanqiu, rest in peace!

My words are endless; let the following poems serve as a supplement.

How many people know his amazing talent and unique skills?
He only lived for fifty years!
To pray for peace, he personally put on makeup,
Ashamed to sing songs of bandits, he learned to plow the fields.
His eyebrows flew as the flag was first raised in the Yan market,
His heart was broken by the ruins of Europe after the catastrophe.
A generation of actors became warriors,
Reading Marx and Engels by the sea.
How can one's life be longer than the life of a flower?
Spirit and career are always hard to grind down.
Planting peaches and plums in the beautiful spring,
Creating a singing style that sobs in the night waves.
What does it matter if you clap the table three times with determination?
Love deeply and make arrangements again.
Gentle, kind, calm and resolute in depicting,
Outstanding remarks remain about Dou E.

Three

Traveling through wind and snow for thousands of miles,
Singing loudly in Moscow, his spirit was like a rainbow.
Loyalty truly came from beyond words,
What was there to say of working while ill?
Tears flowed horizontally, pitying Uncle Lao,
Remembering Master Yingong with a bitter heart.
Crying for my brother only for the sake of the pear orchard world,
It is rare to be both skilled and willing to be popular.

[Note 1] "Tears of the Wilderness" is also known as "Praying for Peace."
[Note 2] Comrade Yanqiu and Zhang Geng visited democratic Germany and passed through various old travel sites. The cultural sites were mostly in ruins. His heart was saddened, and he felt incomparable hatred for imperialist war.
[Note 3] The year before last, he also went to Qingdao to participate in the Second Philosophy Study, where he made great progress, laying the foundation for his later joining of the Party.
[Note 4] Mr. Chen Shutong said: When Yanqiu was twenty-four years old, he sent him a poem with the line, "One's life is only a few days longer than the life of a flower, losing to the sound of selling flowers." Uncle Lao greatly appreciated his poem, but felt that his emotions were not healthy enough.
[Note 5] "The Jade Hairpin" and other plays mostly depict kind women enduring unbearable persecution and slander. Due to her unwavering loyalty, the truth is finally revealed.
[Note 6] The fifth issue of "Dramatic Studies" contains Yanqiu's "Talking About Dou E," with incisive arguments that have become his final work.
[Note 7] The day before Yanqiu entered the hospital, he was still rehearsing the export program "Presenting Swords," unwilling to rest.

    悼党的戏曲战士程砚秋同志
    田汉
    在戏剧创作会议小组会上听得程砚秋同志病重的消息，曾经赶到他家，了解了病情，也到病床边跟他谈了话。他笑着说：“若按昨天的情形，我几乎以为要跟大家告别了。”随即北京医院的大夫来了，诊视以后立即送他到医院去检查，我们看着他上了车才回来，预备隔几天再去看他。
    但是在我写这文章的时候，这位还在壮年的党的卓越的戏剧家已经离开我们三天了。这是继王瑶卿、尚和玉、杨宝森诸先生之后中国戏剧界又一个难于补偿的重大损失！
    程砚秋同志也是由于家里贫苦才学上戏的。聪明的年轻人学上了这行优秀的传统艺术也就迅速地爱上了它。但单凭旧的师傅传授，很难满足他的精进的要求。他有心胸，有勇气，技术练习之外，自力钻研文化，他好结交文艺界前辈，也得到他们的帮助，陈叔通先生，罗瘿公先生们都是对于他的进步有过贡献的。砚秋同志也十分重视地方戏，他的水袖工夫等等，据说就受过晋剧艺人水上飘的影响。
    砚秋同志是一位有丰富感情和坚毅斗志的艺术家。他是一位典型的青衣演员，因而也是一位优秀的悲剧演员，他的戏主要表现善良贞纯的中国女性在难堪的迫害讥谗之下，用盘根错节、坚毅不屈的行为做回答来取得最终胜利。中国的社会对妇女的重重压迫也锻炼出了中国妇女许多崇高品质，砚秋同志的艺术就大部分表现了中国妇女这种品质。他的代表作“荒山泪”一面攻击旧社会猛于虎的苛政，一面做和平的祈祷，剧中女主人公最后的台词说：“我不如拼一死上天乞请，愿国家从此后永久和平”。这代表了当时痛苦人民迫切的愿望，虽说这一愿望只有在今天人民时代才能实现。另一代表作“春闺梦”，借三国时代的故事讽刺寡人之妻，孤人之子，抽丁当军。当时封建军阀们多以升官发财诱引人民替他打仗。砚秋同志借剧中女主人公的口唱道：“粗茶饭还胜那黄金斗印，愿此生长相守怜我怜卿。”当国民党发动内战的时候，砚秋同志演出此剧。一个东北救灾委员会的国民党员对他说：“这戏若在抗战中演出该多好！”砚秋同志正色地说：“不，抗战的时候不能演，现在演才好哩。”
    砚秋同志正是这样一位有原则性战斗性的人，他后来靠拢党和参加党是很自然的。
    砚秋同志还演过“青霜剑”，“碧玉簪”，“鸳鸯塚”等等新戏，解放后还演过“英台抗婚”，都是有功民主斗争的作品。他演的老戏如“三击掌”，“窦娥冤”等等也是这个类型。从来一定的内容要求一定的艺术形式，砚秋同志根据他所选择的女性人物的受压抑的个性，也根据他自己的嗓音条件，创造了抑郁宛转的程腔。这种具有独特风格的唱腔受到广大欢迎。
    砚秋同志很早注意到戏曲教育，他所创办的中华戏曲专科学校培养了德、和、金、玉四科。今天京剧界许多名演员多是程门的桃李。他也曾到欧洲考察，发表过他的考察记。回国之后对于舞台形象的改革等做过一些尝试。他除歌剧观感之外还在剧学月刊发表过“话剧导演管窥”，他对于戏剧具有广阔的知识。
    许多人都知道砚秋同志是一个爱国者。在日伪横行时期他跟梅兰芳周信芳诸先生都有很好的表现，他甚至正面和敌特格斗，在京西青龙桥种地，拒绝演出。
    我个人在北京解放初期才和砚秋同志有较多交往。人民解放军北京入城以前曾借用过他的青龙桥的房屋。他起先是有些抵触的，也对我谈起过。北京解放以后他回到青龙桥，发现解放军离开以后，没有带走或是破坏他任何一样东西，而且保护得十分周到。他才发现世界上真有这样人民的军队，没有像他在“荒山泪”中所唱的“眼见得好村庄化为灰烬”，这使他感动极了，再看入城后许多英明措施，他对党，对人民政权，对毛主席感到无限的亲切和爱戴了。
    1949年我们一道经苏联到布拉格参加世界保卫和平大会，在国际列车上我们又同车厢，因而谈得很多，他表示“热爱党，很难用言语表达地热爱党！”
    在布拉格的时候，砚秋同志的长子从比国赶来了，曾帮助他把他的发言翻成法文。
    抗美援朝之役，砚秋同志和梅先生等冒大雪、踏冰河到朝鲜战地演出慰问人民志愿军，其后又慰问过人民解放军。
    作为全国人民代表和中国戏曲研究院副院长，他曾多次到西北、西南、东北视察和演出。周扬同志对他在1950年2月所作“西北戏曲访问小记”曾去过公开信，十分赞成他的研究计划，认为京剧界有些朋友看不起地方戏，而他如此重视地方戏，值得大家学习；也同意他对戏曲界盲目崇拜西洋，无视民族遗产的批评，只是认为旧剧真正感人的地方恰恰在于它的写实力，批评他不应拒绝向话剧电影等兄弟艺术的写实方法学习。由于砚秋同志对话剧等有理解，这一缺点后来纠正了。
    砚秋同志对于艺术有他独到的地方，但有时也不免走向偏激；他一生为自己的艺术和事业孤军奋斗，因此也每每落落寡合，这些缺点在他接受马克思主义以后就逐渐显著地改变了。他以前不太愿意教学生，这几年不止是中国戏曲实验学校开了他的课，他热心培养了好几个他的后继者，而且在山西、四川会演的时候给各地名演员说腔，说身段，说水袖工夫，辛勤细致，不遗余力。最近他病了，但在他入医院以前一天，还到北纬饭店替上海京剧院导演出国节目“百花赠剑”。
    砚秋就是这样一位好同志！
    入殓时我看了他那带着一丝微笑的口角，好像要说什么话似的。为什么不呢？党和人民正在期待他说出许多话，唱出许多新的，不是抑郁宛转而是充满愉快激情的歌声啊！
    党十分悼惜这位文化战士之死。砚秋同志还在预备期，他死后党特追认他为正式党员。
    砚秋同志安息吧！
    我的话说不完，让下面几首诗来做补充。一惊才绝艺几人知？才得春秋五十余！为祷和平亲粉墨，〔一〕耻歌寇盗学犁锄。眉飞燕市初升帜，肠断欧洲劫后墟。〔二〕一代伶工成战士，海边精读马恩书。〔三〕二人寿何如花寿多？〔四〕精神事业总难磨。栽成桃李妍春日，创出声腔咽夜波。志决何妨三击掌，爱深凭汝再张罗。〔五〕温良沉毅工描写，卓论犹留说窦娥。〔六〕 三风雪征车万里同，高歌莫市气如虹，精忠真出语言外，工作何辞疾病中？〔七〕热泪纵横怜叔老，苦心惨淡忆瘿公。哭兄只为梨园界，难得能专又肯红。
              三月十一日
    〔注一〕“荒山泪”一名“祈祷和平”。
    〔注二〕砚秋与张庚同志曾访民主德国，经旧游各地，文化胜迹半成废墟，他目击心伤，对帝国主义战争感到无比痛恨。
    〔注三〕前年又到青岛参加第二届哲学学习，进步极大，为后来入党打下基础。
    〔注四〕陈叔通先生说：砚秋二十四岁那年寄诗给他，有“人寿比花多几日，输它犹有卖花声”句。叔老很赞赏他的诗，而觉得他感情不够健康。
    〔注五〕碧玉簪各剧多写善良妇女忍受难堪迫害谗诬，由于她的坚贞不渝的行为，最后真相大白。
    〔注六〕戏剧论丛第五期载砚秋“谈窦娥”，论点精辟，已成绝笔。
    〔注七〕砚秋入医院前一日还排练出国节目“赠剑”，不肯休息。
