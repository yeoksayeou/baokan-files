Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd. The Chinese Medical Association headquarters invited some council members in Beijing to a symposium on February 27 to discuss the self-ideological remolding of medical scientists. More than twenty medical scientists attended the meeting and warmly responded to the initiative proposed by seventeen scientists in Shanghai, expressing their determination to transform themselves in the great leap forward of the motherland's socialist construction and resolutely become leftists. A declaration was adopted at the meeting, in which the guarantees proposed were: Striving to train themselves into socialist medical workers who are both red and expert within two to three years; Resolutely obeying the leadership of the Party, closely connecting with the masses, humbly listening to criticisms, transforming their own thoughts, and improving their own work; Establishing a diligent and thrifty work style, contributing all their strength to accelerate the completion of the national scientific vision plan and accelerate the realization of the requirements for health work put forward in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft); Academic activities will be more closely integrated with the needs of people's health and the needs of national construction; Through association activities, actively help young medical cadres improve their political and technical levels, and expand the ranks of medical workers who are both red and expert.
