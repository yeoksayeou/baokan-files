The Standing Committee members of the Municipal Party Committee listened to reports from responsible cadres and chief engineers of the Harbin Electric Motor Factory and other undertaking units attending the meeting regarding the progress and problems in the trial production work, and conducted discussions on the spot, solving many specific problems. The meeting also made resolutions on important issues such as strengthening political and ideological leadership and technical leadership in the trial production work, and strengthening production collaboration between factories.
