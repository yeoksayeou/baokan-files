    Rouge Lips
    Feng Yuanjun
    New Year's attempt at writing, recording feelings about participating in the National People's Congress, and praising the great leap forward in rural production.
    Reversing the universe, infinite potential is unleashed. Mountains move and rivers are cut, regardless of wind and snow. A sea of lights shines brightly, a sea of people surging in thousands of layers. Without rest, ardently facing the heavens, construction sites celebrate the Spring Festival.
    Drawing water up the mountain, the miracle is commonly said to be "immortal transmission of the Dao." Old farmers become enlightened, even more ingenious than immortals. Building reservoirs and digging canals, changing the landscape. Who would have expected that even the desolate peaks of Hexi would grow rice from Jiangnan.

    点绛唇
    冯沅君
    新春试笔，记参加全国人民代表大会的感受，并为农村生产大跃进礼赞。
    扭转乾坤，无穷潜力从挥发。山移川决，那管风和雪。灯海辉煌，人海浪千叠。无休歇，朝天火热，工地过春节。
    引水登山，神奇共说“仙传道”。老农开窍，还比神仙巧。筑库开渠，改却江山貌。谁曾料，河西荒峤，也种江南稻。
