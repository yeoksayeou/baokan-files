Fuxin Electric News—The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting in Fuxin from the 14th to the 16th to promote the experience of leading cadres of the Fuxin Central Machinery Repair Factory in running "experimental plots," the experience of leading cadres of the Fuxin Ping'an Coal Mine moving their homes to workers' residential areas, and the experience of grassroots cadres of the third pit of this mine participating in production to lead production. More than 300 leading cadres from 149 industrial enterprises from various places who attended the meeting proposed an initiative to leading cadres of industrial enterprises throughout the province: to implement "experimental plots" within three days and move their homes from "cadre residential areas" to workers' residential areas within seven days, to live and work with workers as ordinary laborers, and to better implement the Party's mass line.

After listening to the introduction of these three experiences and visiting the sites of these units, the participants launched heated discussions overnight. Everyone agreed that these experiences have universal significance in industrial enterprises. The common fundamental characteristic of these experiences is: to work and live with the masses, to learn technology from the masses in labor, to go among the masses to lead the masses, and to lead production in the production process. The experience of the Central Machinery Repair Factory has opened up a good way for leading cadres of factories and mines to learn the leadership method of running "experimental plots"; the experience of the leading cadres of the third pit of Ping'an Coal Mine in participating in production to lead production based on the spirit of planting "experimental plots" has pointed out the correct direction for how cadres at the workshop level should lead production; the revolutionary action of the mine-level leading cadres of Ping'an Coal Mine in breaking through the thinking of their families and moving their homes from "cadre residential areas" to workers' residential areas, living and living with workers, has set a good example for enterprise leading cadres to eliminate bureaucratic airs and closely link with the masses. The participants unanimously agreed that if all industrial enterprises can implement these three experiences, leading cadres can truly go among the masses to lead the masses, thoroughly overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism, and cadres can embark on the road of being both red and expert, realizing the unity of politics and technology.

After discussion and deliberation, the leaders of more than 40 factories in Shenyang who participated in the meeting put forward specific guarantee conditions for implementing these three experiences and challenged the leaders of other regions present at the meeting. The leaders of various regions immediately studied the conditions for accepting the challenge. Within a few hours, many big-character posters expressing the desire to quickly promote these three experiences were posted at the meeting place. Many people also called their own enterprises, asking them to start preliminary preparations so that they could take immediate action after returning.

In order to promote a great leap forward in the work style of enterprise leaders throughout the province, the participants unanimously adopted the initiative to leading cadres of industrial enterprises throughout the province, launching a revolutionary competition to compare leadership styles and leadership art. They guaranteed that within three days after the meeting, the three experiences of Fuxin would be specifically implemented into action; all leading cadres of industrial enterprises participating in the meeting would move their homes to workers' residential areas and settle down within a week, and take various ways to closely contact the masses, competing to make friends with workers, seeing who makes more friends, faster, and better; eliminate bureaucratic airs, eradicate special privileges, participate in various social activities of residents completely as ordinary laborers, and encourage family members to participate in street activities.

Finally, Yu Ping, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a concluding report to the conference. Yu Ping asked the participants and party organizations at all levels to fully value these experiences, resolutely and quickly promote these experiences, and continuously develop and enrich these experiences in the process of promotion, so that they become more complete. On the 17th, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also issued instructions, requiring party organizations of all industrial enterprises in the province to universally promote the three experiences of Fuxin. The instructions pointed out that these three experiences are a fundamental reform of the work style of enterprise cadres, a revolution in leadership style and leadership methods, and point out the correct path for fundamentally changing the situation of enterprise cadres being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, thoroughly overcoming bureaucracy and subjectivism, and realizing the combination of political work and economic work, and the unity of politics and technology.

    辽宁省推广阜新三项革新领导方法的经验
    本报阜新电　中共辽宁省委从14日到16日在阜新召开了现场会议，推广阜新中央机修厂领导干部搞“试验田”、阜新平安煤矿领导干部把家搬到工人住宅区和这个矿的三坑基层干部参加生产领导生产三项经验。到会的各地一百四十九个工业企业的三百多名领导干部，当场向全省工业企业领导干部提出倡议：在三天内推行“试验田”，七天内把家从“干部住宅区”搬到工人住宅区，以普通劳动者的一员和工人同生活共劳动，更好地贯彻执行党的群众路线。
    参加会议的人听了这三项经验的介绍，到这几个单位的现场参观以后，连夜展开热烈的讨论。大家一致认为，这些经验在工业企业中具有普遍意义。这些经验共同的根本特点是：和群众共同劳动，共同生活，在劳动中向群众学技术，到群众中间去领导群众，在生产过程中领导生产。中央机修厂的经验，为厂矿领导干部学习搞“试验田”的领导方法开辟了良好的途径；平安煤矿三坑领导干部根据种“试验田”的精神参加生产领导生产的经验，为车间一级干部如何领导生产指出了正确的方向；平安煤矿矿一级领导干部打通家属思想把家从“干部住宅区”搬到工人住宅区，和工人同住同生活的革命行动，为企业的领导干部打掉官气、密切联系群众树立了好榜样。参加会议的人一致认为，如果所有的工业企业都能够推行这三个经验，就可以使领导干部真正做到到群众中间去领导群众，彻底克服官僚主义和主观主义，就可以使干部走上又红又专的道路，实现政治和技术的统一。
    沈阳市参加会议的四十多个工厂的领导人员，经过讨论和酝酿，提出了具体贯彻这三项经验的保证条件，向到会的其他地区的领导干部挑战。各个地区的领导干部都立即研究了应战条件。几小时工夫，会场上就贴出了许多表示要迅速推广这三项经验的大字报。许多人还往本企业打电话，要求先酝酿布置，做好准备，以便回去后立即行动。
    到会的人为了推动全省企业领导人员作风大跃进，一致通过了向全省工业企业领导干部提出的倡议，发起一个比领导作风、比领导艺术的革命竞赛。他们保证在会后三天之内，把阜新的这三个经验具体贯彻到行动中去；参加会议的所有工业企业领导干部要在一周内把家搬到工人住宅区落户，并且采取各种方式密切联系群众，比赛同工人交朋友，看谁交的朋友多，交的快，交的好；打掉官气，肃清特殊化，完全以普通劳动者的姿态参加居民的各种社会活动，并且鼓励家属参加街道的活动。
    大会最后由中共辽宁省委书记喻屏作了总结报告。喻屏要求到会人员和各级党组织充分重视这些经验，坚决、迅速地推行这些经验，而且要在推行中不断地发展、充实这些经验，使它们更加完整。17日，中共辽宁省委还发出指示，要求全省各工业企业党组织普遍推广阜新的这三项经验。指示中指出，这三项经验是企业干部作风的根本性改革，是领导作风领导方法的革命，为从根本上改变企业干部的脱离群众、脱离实际的状况，彻底克服官僚主义、主观主义，实现政治工作和经济工作的结合、政治和技术的统一，指出了正确的道路。
