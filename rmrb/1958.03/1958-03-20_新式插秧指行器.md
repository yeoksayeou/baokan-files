New-style Rice Planting Row Marker
Hongzheng District, Huaining County, Anhui Province, has decided to promote close planting with a spacing of 3×6 inches. The picture above shows two types of rice planting row markers designed by the local people themselves. With the row marker, even beginners don't have to worry about inaccurate row spacing when transplanting rice seedlings.

    新式插秧指行器
    安徽怀宁县洪正区，决定推行3×6寸密植。上图即是当地群众自己设计的两种插秧指行器。有了指行器，生手插秧也就不用发愁行距不准了。
