The poor county is not worried, let's look at "cow rolling"
Shuangbai County, Yunnan Province, Develops Industry Through Self-Reliance

    (Our report) Shuangbai County, Yunnan Province, without spending a penny of state money, plans to increase its total local industrial output value by more than eleven times this year.
    Shuangbai is a mountainous county, and even the county seat is located on a hillside. It is known as one of the three poorest prefectures in Yunnan (formerly the seat of the prefecture). In the early days of liberation, there wasn't even a sewing machine in the county. In the past few years, although an inter-county highway and an intra-county highway have been built, and five factories and mines have been established, the total industrial output value was only 1.01 million yuan last year, accounting for only 12.3% of the total industrial and agricultural output value.
    However, Shuangbai County has entire mountains of virgin forest and abundant mineral deposits. The recently discovered oil shale is of very high grade, with an oil content of 90% to 70%. After the Shuangbai County Committee of the Communist Party of China vigorously rejected conservative ideas, it decided that while doubling the total agricultural output value this year, it would also increase local industry by more than eleven times, bringing the total industrial output value to 11.4 million yuan, accounting for 44.7% of the total industrial and agricultural output value.
    In order to raise funds for industrial development, Shuangbai County adopted the "cow rolling" method. First, the non-staple food processing plant was expanded, and a net profit of 4,000 yuan could be obtained in January. Logging virgin forests can yield 70,000 yuan this year. A large open-pit coal mine was also opened, and coking coal was refined to supply three factories in Yimen for copper smelting, which can yield 300,000 yuan in a quarter. Then, these funds are used to build lead mines. After the lead is refined, the profits from lead production are used to build other factories and mines. Five of the fifteen newly built factories and mines are now in production.

### 穷县不愁，且看“牛打滚”  云南双柏县自力更生发展工业

    穷县不愁，且看“牛打滚”
    云南双柏县自力更生发展工业
    本报讯　不用国家一分钱，云南省双柏县今年地方工业总产值要激增十一倍多。
    双柏是个山区县，连县城也是坐落在山坡上，被称为云南三大穷州之一（过去是州治）。解放初期，县内连缝纫机都没有。几年来虽然修了一条县际公路、一条县内公路，并建立了五个厂矿，但直到去年，工业总产值还只一百零一万元，仅占工农业总产值的12.3％。
    可是双柏县有整山整山的原始森林，有丰富的矿藏。最近发现的油母页岩品位很高，含油率达90％—70％。中共双柏县委大力反掉保守思想后，决定今年在农业总产值翻一番的同时，还要使地方工业激增十一倍多，使工业总产值达到一千一百四十万元，占工农业总产值的44.7％。
    为了筹集发展工业的资金，双柏县采取“牛打滚”的办法。先扩建了副食品加工厂，1月可得纯利润四千元。开伐原始森林，今年可得七万元。又开挖一个大露天煤矿，炼成焦煤供应易门三家厂炼铜，一个季度可得三十万元。然后利用这些钱来建设铅矿，炼出铅后，又用生产铅的利润去建别的厂矿。现在新建的十五个厂矿已有五个投入生产。
