	The Modern "Robinson"
	Bahrain Island in the Persian Gulf will soon welcome the return of a "Robinson." This man is named A. Haji Nasir, a pearl collector. In 1925, he encountered a storm near Bahrain Island and drifted to a desert island in the Persian Gulf, where he lived alone for thirty-three years. He was recently discovered by a sailboat engaged in coastal trade. At the time, Nasir was completely naked and covered in long hair. Nasir said that he sustained himself with grass, seaweed, and fish.
