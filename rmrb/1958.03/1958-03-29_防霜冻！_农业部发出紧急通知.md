Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The Ministry of Agriculture today issued an emergency notice requiring all regions to take various measures to prevent frost. The Huai River basin and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River must immediately engage in the fight against frost.

The notice stated that according to forecasts from the Central Meteorological Science Research Institute, the temperature in the Huai River basin and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River will drop below 0 degrees Celsius on the morning of the 29th. The lowest temperature in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and Zhejiang will also drop to around 0 degrees Celsius. However, wheat in the Huai River and Yangtze River basins has already jointed, and rapeseed is entering its full flowering period. Therefore, these areas should immediately take various measures to combat frost. Based on the experience of 1953 and 1954, the most effective way to prevent frost is to water in time before the frost, which can缓和局部温度变化,减轻冻害. After the frost, it is even more important to apply top dressing and water in time, and strengthen management to promote the rapid recovery of wheat and rapeseed growth.

This year, rice has been sown earlier than in previous years in many areas of the south. During this cold wave, management of rice seedling fields should be strengthened to prevent rotten seedlings.

The notice said: According to China's meteorological characteristics, from the end of March to the middle and late April, all localities should pay close attention to weather forecasts at all times, be vigilant against possible frost, and take all effective measures to prevent rice seedlings from rotting and wheat and rapeseed from being frostbitten.

　  防霜冻！
    农业部发出紧急通知
    新华社28日讯　农业部今天发出紧急通知，要求各地采取各种措施预防霜冻。淮河流域和长江下游地区要立即同霜冻展开斗争。
    通知说，据中央气象科学研究所预报，29日晨淮河流域及长江下游气温将降到摄氏零度以下，长江中游及浙江最低气温也将降到摄氏零度左右。但目前淮河及长江流域的小麦已经拔节，油菜正进入盛花期，因此，这些地区应立即采取各种措施同霜冻斗争。根据1953年和1954年的经验，防止霜冻最有效的办法是在冻前及时浇水，可以缓和局部温度变化，减轻冻害。冻后更要及时追肥浇水，加强管理，促使小麦、油菜迅速恢复生长。
    今年南方很多地区水稻都比往年提前播种，在这次寒流中更要加强秧田管理，防止烂秧。
    通知说：根据我国气象特点，在3月底至4月中、下旬期间各地要密切注意气象预报，随时警惕可能发生的霜冻，采取一切有效办法，防止水稻烂秧，和小麦、油菜受冻。
