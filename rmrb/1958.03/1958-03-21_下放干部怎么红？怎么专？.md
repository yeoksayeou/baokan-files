    How Should Downward Transferred Cadres Become "Red"? How Should They Become "Expert"?
    Xing Zhi
    The Shanghai Municipal Representative Conference of Downward Transferred Cadres was a good one. It was good not only because such a conference can help downward transferred cadres solve ideological problems, but also because it raised an important question: In labor training, downward transferred cadres should not only transform their thinking but also delve into agricultural techniques.
    Some downward transferred cadres believe that they have gone to the countryside to transform their thinking, not to be farmers for life, so why bother studying agricultural techniques? It is true that cadres are sent to the countryside for labor training to transform their thinking. What kind of thinking should be transformed? First of all, it is the kind of thinking that looks down on workers and peasants and underestimates physical labor. If some downward transferred cadres have no interest in agricultural production and agricultural techniques, this is actually still looking down on workers and peasants and underestimating agricultural production. How can they transform their thinking well? It should be known that the transformation of thinking of downward transferred cadres is not just empty talk, but must be achieved through a relatively long period of labor. Cadres sent to the countryside are to transform their thinking through a relatively long period of agricultural production. The transformation of thinking and agricultural production are closely linked and absolutely inseparable in them. If downward transferred cadres are not familiar with the agricultural production process and do not study agricultural production techniques, how can they labor well? And how can they transform their thinking well?
    Moreover, the entire countryside is in a great leap forward, and the vast number of peasants are studying agricultural techniques, and they urgently need scientific knowledge and technical assistance. Downward transferred cadres should not only transform their thinking in labor training, but also bring their culture, science, and technology knowledge to the countryside, and provide practical and patient help to the peasants in this regard. How to help? This is to combine their own culture, science, and technology knowledge with agricultural production. First, they must study agricultural techniques themselves, and then they can use their knowledge to help peasants improve their techniques. If downward transferred cadres take an uninterested and hands-off attitude toward studying agricultural techniques in the midst of the great leap forward in agricultural technology, this in itself is a very wrong idea. How can one talk about ideological transformation with this kind of thinking?
    Therefore, downward transferred cadres should have their bodies in the countryside and their hearts in the countryside. In the countryside, they must be both "red" and "expert," and they can only become "red" in the process of becoming "expert." The idea of "red at the lower level, expert at the upper level; red in the countryside, expert in the city" is completely wrong. It is only a narrow understanding of "expert," and it does not understand how to become "red."
    As for what to study and what to delve into, it is not a problem. The countryside is a vast world, and there are many things to learn and delve into. Agricultural knowledge and agricultural techniques should be learned and delved into well. But this is not all of learning and studying, because downward transferred cadres are not ordinary peasants after all. In addition to learning production and learning technology, they should also be familiar with the situation of rural work. See how township and commune grassroots cadres work, learn how they follow the mass line, learn their working methods of closely contacting reality and contacting the masses; understand the implementation of policies, understand the struggle between the two roads in the countryside; do some rural research, study the changes that have taken place in the countryside and among the peasants…. In a word, as long as they are comrades who wholeheartedly temper and transform themselves in the countryside, they will feel that they can learn at any time and everywhere. If in such a good environment, they do not learn and do not delve into it, then they will really be like returning empty-handed from a mountain of treasures. Only by settling down, learning, and delving into it can they labor well, can they be tempered well, and can they truly be "red."

    下放干部怎么红？怎么专？
    幸之
    上海市下放干部代表会议开得好，所以好，不仅因为这样的会可以帮助下放干部解决思想问题，还因为这个会上提出了一个重要问题，就是下放干部在劳动锻炼中既要改造思想，也要钻研农业技术。
    有的下放干部认为自己到农村去是改造思想的，并不是一辈子去作农民的，何必钻农业技术呢？不错，干部下放劳动锻炼是为了改造思想。改造什么思想，首先就是改造轻视工农、轻视体力劳动这种思想，如果有的下放干部对农业生产和农业技术毫无兴趣，这实际上还是轻视工农、轻视农业生产，如何能把思想改造好呢？应该知道，下放干部改造思想不是一句空话，而是要通过比较长期的劳动来实现的，下放到农村的干部，就是要在比较长期的农业生产中来改造思想的，改造思想和农业生产在他们身上是密切相联绝对不可分的，如果下放干部不熟悉农业生产过程，不钻研农业生产技术，如何能劳动得好呢？又如何能把思想改造好呢？
    还有，整个农村都在跃进，广大农民都在钻研农业技术，他们又迫切需要科学知识，需要技术帮助。下放干部不但要在劳动锻炼中改造思想，也要把自己的文化、科学、技术知识带到农村去，要在这方面切实地耐心的帮助农民。如何帮助？这就是要把自己的文化、科学、技术知识和农业生产结合起来，首先自己要钻研农业技术，然后才能用自己的知识去帮助农民提高技术。如果下放干部在农业技术大跃进声中对钻研农业技术采取不感兴趣袖手旁观的态度，这本身就是一种极错误的思想，抱着这种思想还谈什么思想改造呢？
    因此，下放干部应该人在农村，心在农村。在农村中既要红，又要专，而且在专的过程中才能红。那种“红在下层，专在上层；红在农村，专在城市”的想法是完全不对的，只是对专的一种狭隘的了解，也没有懂得如何才能红的问题。
    至于钻什么、学什么，更不成问题，农村是一个广大的天地，可学习可钻研的东西非常多，农业知识，农业技术，应该好好学，好好钻。但这还不是学习和钻研的全部，因为下放干部究竟不是普通的农民，除了学生产、学技术，还应该熟悉农村工作的情况。看看乡、社基层干部究竟怎样工作，学习他们如何走群众路线，学习他们密切联系实际联系群众的工作方法；了解一下政策执行的情况，了解一下农村中两条道路斗争的情况；做一点农村考察，研究一下农村和农民身上所发生的变化……。一句话，只要是全心全意地在农村锻炼改造自己的同志，就会感到时时可学处处可学，如果在这样一个大好环境中，不学，不钻，那将来真是如入宝山空手回了。只有安下心来，学习，钻研，才能劳动得好、才能锻炼得好，也才能真“红”。
