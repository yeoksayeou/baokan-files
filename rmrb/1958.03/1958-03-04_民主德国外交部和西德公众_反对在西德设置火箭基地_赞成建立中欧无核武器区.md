Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 28th: The German News Agency (ADN) reports: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement saying: The government of the German Democratic Republic delivered a reply to the Polish government on the 27th, concerning its memorandum of February 14th. The reply pointed out that the government of the German Democratic Republic is ready at any time to conclude corresponding agreements with the countries concerned on the issue of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

The statement said that the principles contained in the Polish government's memorandum regarding the establishment of a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone are consistent with the views of the government of the German Democratic Republic on this issue.

The statement accused the West German government of adopting a negative attitude towards the Polish proposal and attempting to obstruct the realization of the Polish proposal by discussing the issue of German unification. It emphasized that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone would actually promote German unification, eliminate the threat of atomic war to Germany, create a good atmosphere for negotiations and reaching understanding, and pave the way for closer relations between the two Germanys.

The statement stressed that whether the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone can be realized now depends on the German people. The government of the German Democratic Republic has proposed to the German people to hold a referendum on this issue and has called on all the German people to do everything possible to strive for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone and to prevent the establishment of rocket launching bases in West Germany, thereby safeguarding European peace and promoting the peaceful reunification of Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: Bonn dispatch: The chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, advocated on the 2nd that the Polish government's proposal for the establishment of a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone should become a matter for international discussion. He also said that if Poland and Czechoslovakia were prepared to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact, West Germany should withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Ollenhauer made the above remarks while speaking at a Social Democratic Party rally in Karlsruhe. He also once again condemned the atomic arms race, especially the arming of West German troops with atomic weapons. He said that rearmament would burden the West German budget by 20 billion West German marks in 1960-61, and this did not include the cost of equipping West German troops with atomic weapons.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Bonn dispatch: As of March 1st, two hundred university professors and lecturers in West Germany had signed a protest against the establishment of rocket bases in West Germany.

The protest pointed out that the establishment of atomic rocket launching platforms would lead to atomic war in Germany, causing destruction to Germany and the German people. The protest demanded serious negotiations on the establishment of a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone.

This protest movement was initiated by Karl Becher, a West German Social Democratic Party member of parliament and a professor at the University of Mainz.

    民主德国外交部和西德公众
    反对在西德设置火箭基地
    赞成建立中欧无核武器区
    新华社讯　据德意志通讯社柏林2月28日讯：德意志民主共和国外交部发表声明说：德意志民主共和国政府27日向波兰政府递交了对它2月14日备忘录的复照。复照中指出，德意志民主共和国政府随时准备同有关国家就建立中欧无原子区问题缔结相应的协定。
    声明说，波兰政府的备忘录中所包含的关于建立中欧无原子武器区的原则是同德意志民主共和国政府在这个问题上的意见相一致的。
    声明指责西德政府对波兰建议采取消极态度，并且企图用关于德国统一问题的讨论来阻挠波兰建议的实现。它强调指出，其实无原子武器区的建立将促进德国的统一，消除德国的原子战争威胁，创造进行谈判和达成谅解的良好气氛，并且为两个德国的接近铺平道路。
    声明着重指出：建立无原子武器区的建议能不能实现，现在取决于德国人民。德意志民主共和国政府已经向德国人民提出就这个问题举行公民投票的建议，并且已经号召全德国人民尽一切力量争取建立无原子武器区和阻止在西德建立火箭发射基地，从而维护欧洲和平和促进德国的和平统一。
    新华社3日讯　波恩消息：西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔2日主张使波兰政府关于建立中欧无核武器区的建议成为国际间讨论的问题。他还说，如果波兰和捷克斯洛伐克准备退出华沙条约，西德就应该退出北大西洋集团。
    奥伦豪尔在卡尔希姆的社会民主党一次集会上讲话时发表了上述意见。他并且再一次谴责原子军备竞赛，特别是反对用原子武器来装备西德军队。他说，重整军备将使1960—61年西德的预算负担达到二百亿西德马克，而这还没有包括西德部队装备原子武器的费用在内。
    据新华社讯　波恩消息：截止到3月1日，西德已经有两百名大学教授和讲师在一项反对在西德设置火箭基地的抗议书上签了名。
    这份抗议书指出，建立原子火箭发射台，就会在德国导致原子战争，使德国和德国人民遭到毁灭。抗议书要求就建立中欧无原子武器区问题进行认真的谈判。
    这次抗议运动是由西德社会民主党议员、美因大学的教授卡尔·贝歇尔特发起的。
