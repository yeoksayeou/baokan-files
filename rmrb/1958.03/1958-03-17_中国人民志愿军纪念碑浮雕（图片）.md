Relief Sculpture of the Monument to the Chinese People's Volunteers
Collective creation by the China Sculpture Factory
The Monument to the Martyrs of the Chinese People's Volunteers will be completed in a certain area of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in June of this year. This monument, which focuses on figures, consists of a 3.5-meter-high bronze statue of an anonymous hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers and two 12-meter-long cement relief sculptures.

    中国人民志愿军纪念碑浮雕
    中国雕塑工厂集体创作
    中国人民志愿军烈士纪念碑，将于今年6月间在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国某地建成。这座以人物为主的纪念碑，是以一座三公尺五十公分高的志愿军无名英雄铜像，和两块十二公尺长的水泥浮雕组成的。
    浮雕的内容，主要是歌颂中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战奋勇前进的情景，以及两国人民亲如一家的友谊。本报今天发表的就是其中的一块。
