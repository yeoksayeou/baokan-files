Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: TASS, Moscow, March 29th: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on the 28th. The note stated that the Soviet Union cannot agree with the U.S. government's arbitrary demarcation of vast danger zones in the high seas, and opposes the U.S. conducting nuclear weapon explosion tests in areas under U.N. trusteeship administered by the United States.

    This statement is a response to the U.S. State Department's note of February 17th. The U.S. note stated that due to nuclear weapon tests, the U.S. would designate the Marshall Islands area in the Pacific as a long-term danger zone starting April 5th.

    The Soviet note pointed out that this action by the U.S. government aims to turn the Marshall Islands and the vast high seas area around the islands into a permanent target range for U.S. nuclear weapon tests. This action by the U.S. government violates the obligations undertaken by the United States under the UN Charter with respect to trust territories, and violates the universally recognized principles of international law concerning the freedom of the high seas.

    The Soviet note pointed out that conducting nuclear weapon tests in the Pacific not only poses a serious threat to the lives and health of the residents on the islands declared as danger zones, but also to the residents far away from these islands. Radioactive substances falling into the water will poison the local fish, thereby causing huge losses to the fishing industry.

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: Washington dispatch: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 29th regarding the note delivered by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union on the 28th.

    The statement, disregarding the Soviet protest and the wishes of people around the world to stop nuclear weapon testing, reiterated that the U.S. government will proceed with nuclear weapon tests in the Pacific starting April 5th as originally planned.

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: New York dispatch: More than one hundred Americans in Newport, Connecticut, and Philadelphia began a "Walk for Peace" movement on the 29th, and they will walk to the United Nations headquarters in New York to demand a stop to nuclear weapon testing.

    About sixty people in Newport set off happily in the sunshine after a short prayer ceremony. About fifty people in Philadelphia also set off at the same time. They hope to meet on the way. Mrs. Willoughby is with the Philadelphia group; her husband is sailing to the U.S. nuclear testing area in the Pacific to protest.

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: TASS, Geneva, March 29th: The Second Committee of the United Nations International Conference on the Law of the Sea has recently discussed the proposal by the delegations of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia to prohibit thermonuclear weapon testing on the high seas.

    Professor Tung Chin, head of the Soviet delegation, and Professor Kairin, a member of the Soviet delegation, pointed out in their speeches that millions of people are demanding the prohibition of thermonuclear weapon testing and firmly demanding that the conference make a decision on this issue, because such testing violates the principle of freedom of the high seas.

    The delegations of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Japan, India, the United Arab Republic, Ceylon, Tunisia, and many other countries also pointed out in their speeches that conducting thermonuclear weapon tests on the high seas is incompatible with the freedom of the high seas, and therefore they appealed to the representatives to pass a resolution prohibiting thermonuclear weapon testing.

    However, some countries participating in the conference obviously do not intend to pass such a resolution. For example, the representatives of Britain, the United States, Turkey, and Pakistan opposed discussing this issue at this conference, insisting that this issue is part of the overall disarmament issue and should be resolved by other UN agencies, and therefore the International Conference on the Law of the Sea cannot resolve this issue.

    After fierce debate, the Second Committee passed a resolution proposed by the Indian delegation. This resolution pointed out that many countries believe that conducting thermonuclear weapon tests on the high seas violates the principle of freedom of the high seas and are prepared to submit this issue to the United Nations General Assembly for necessary measures.

    The Soviet delegation pointed out that this resolution has great shortcomings, and therefore the Soviet delegation abstained during the vote. Poland, the United Arab Republic, Czechoslovakia, Burma, Indonesia, and some other countries also abstained. (Attached picture)

    反对在公海任意划定危险区
    苏联指责美国要在太平洋试核武器
    苏捷波日印等国在海洋法会议上指斥美国破坏公海自由原则
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科29日讯：苏联外交部28日交给美国驻莫斯科大使馆一份照会。这个照会说，苏联不能同意美国政府在公海任意划定广大危险区，并且反对美国在联合国交给美国托管的地区进行核武器爆炸试验。
    这个声明是对美国国务院2月17日的照会的答复。美国的照会说，由于进行核武器试验，从4月5日起美国将要把太平洋马绍尔群岛地区长期划为危险区。
    苏联的照会指出，美国政府这个行动是要把马绍尔群岛和群岛附近一带广大的公海变成美国试验核武器的永久打靶场。美国政府这个行动违反根据联合国宪章美国对托管地区承担的义务，违反公认的有关公海自由的国际法原则。
    苏联照会指出，在太平洋进行核武器试验不仅使被宣布为危险区的岛上的居民，而且也使远离这些岛的居民的生命和健康遭到严重的威胁。放射性物质落入水中将使当地的鱼中毒，从而给渔业造成巨大损失。
    据新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院29日就苏联外交部28日交给美国驻苏大使馆的照会发表声明。
    声明不顾苏联的抗议和各国人民要求停止试验核武器的愿望，再次表示美国政府将要按照原订计划在4月5日开始在太平洋试验核武器。
    据新华社30日讯　纽约消息：康涅狄格州新港和费城有一百多名美国人29日开始了“为和平而奔走”运动，他们将步行到纽约联合国总部去要求停止试验核武器。
    新港大约有六十人经过简短的祈祷仪式之后在阳光照耀下高高兴兴地出发了。费城也有大约五十人同时出发。他们希望在半路上会合。费城那一批人有威洛贝太太，她的丈夫正在坐着帆船到美国在太平洋的核试验地区进行抗议。
    据新华社30日讯　塔斯社日内瓦29日讯：联合国国际海洋法问题会议第二委员会最近几天讨论了苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和南斯拉夫代表团所提出的禁止在公海上进行热核武器试验的建议。
    苏联代表团团长童金教授和苏联代表团团员凯林教授在发言中指出，千百万人民要求禁止试验热核武器，并且坚决要求本会议对这个问题作出决定，因为这种试验是违背公海自由的原则的。
    波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、日本、印度、阿拉伯联合共和国、锡兰、突尼斯和其他许多国家的代表团在发言中也都指出，在公海上进行热核武器试验是同公海自由不相容的，因此他们向代表们呼吁通过禁止热核武器试验的决议。
    但是，参加会议的某些国家显然不打算通过这种决议。例如，英国、美国、土耳其和巴基斯坦代表都反对在这次会议上讨论这个问题，硬说这个问题是总的裁军问题的一部分，要由联合国其他机构来解决，因此，国际海洋法问题会议不能解决这个问题。
    经过激烈的辩论，第二委员会通过了印度代表团提出的决议案。这个决议案指出，很多国家认为，在公海上进行热核武器试验破坏了公海自由的原则，并且准备把这个问题提交联合国大会，以便采取必要的措施。
    苏联代表团指出，这个决议是有很大缺陷的，因此，苏联代表团在表决时弃权。弃权的还有波兰、阿拉伯联合共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、缅甸、印度尼西亚和其他一些国家。（附图片）
