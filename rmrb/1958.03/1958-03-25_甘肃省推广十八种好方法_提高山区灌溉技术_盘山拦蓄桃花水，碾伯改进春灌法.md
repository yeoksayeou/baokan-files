Gansu Province Promotes Eighteen Good Methods
To Improve Mountain Irrigation Technology
Building Dams to Intercept Peach Blossom Water in Panshan, Improving Spring Irrigation Methods in Nianbo

(Our report) Lanzhou Daily News: In order to summarize and promote mountain irrigation experience, fully launch a high tide of water conservancy and irrigation, overcome drought, and strive for a bumper harvest this year, the Gansu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry Water Conservancy Bureau convened a provincial (excluding Zhangye Special Zone) mountain irrigation conference in Wushan County.

This conference was held with the Dongliang Canal bank as the classroom and mountain irrigation methods as the teaching material. After visiting the Dongliang Canal and mountain irrigation methods, participants then used the canal water and various types of steep slopes on the canal bank to personally operate and practice on-site. The irrigation experience already existing in various places and new methods boldly conceived by individuals were also demonstrated on the spot. Assessments were made using the four criteria of uniform infiltration, reduced scouring, ease of cultivation, and ensuring increased production, and everyone made comparisons. The experience of mountain irrigation was fully exchanged through the method of fully airing views, great contention, and great debate.

During the conference, a total of more than thirty irrigation methods were practiced and demonstrated. After evaluation, eighteen methods were considered effective and could be universally promoted. For example, the ridge irrigation method of adapting to local conditions, dispersing runoff, high opening, and low embankment; the irrigation experience of Dongliang Canal's "three fasts and one slow," namely, fast eyes, fast hands, fast legs, and slow water flow, were praised by the participating comrades.

(Our report) Liaoning Daily News: Panshan County, Liaoning Province, has decided to build a large number of plain reservoirs this year to store water for irrigation. It is planned that this one project alone can irrigate 100,000 mu of paddy fields.

Panshan County has low-lying terrain and many rivers, and is the gateway for all rivers to enter the sea. Therefore, during the flood season, the river water rises and falls sharply, especially during the spring peach blossom water season, when spring floods have to be prevented every year. When it is time to use water for irrigation, the river water drops and becomes a dry river. This situation has not changed in the past.

This year, in addition to focusing on Shaling to irrigate 53,000 mu of paddy fields using peach blossom water, all districts such as Xi'an, Hujia, and Tianjia will build plain reservoirs for irrigation. The county plans to irrigate 100,000 mu of land. The land where the plain reservoirs are built can still be planted after irrigation, and it can also solve the problem of waterlogging. Some saline-alkali soils can also be improved after being soaked in water.

(Our report) Qinghai Daily News: Comrade Lan Deqing, Secretary of the Nianbo Town Party Committee, and others, during their inspection of spring plowing, found in the Shaba, Yangjiamen, and other agricultural cooperatives that due to the lax management of canals during spring sowing and irrigation, and the lack of a strong sense of responsibility among the members when watering the fields, there was a great waste of water. For example, in spring sowing and irrigation, the universal practice was to flood irrigate with large amounts of water, without carrying out small furrow and thin water irrigation as stipulated in the production increase measures, resulting in water wastage. Some members had no plan when releasing water, and the released water was so large that it overflowed everywhere, resulting in a great waste. After watering the fields, they did not return the water to its original place, but let the water flow into the land that had already been winter-irrigated, affecting spring sowing.

The town leaders convened a meeting of the cooperative directors and the leaders of the working groups in each working area. At the meeting, it was decided that, in order to ensure that not a single drop of water is wasted and to ensure sufficient water for spring sowing, all 22 agricultural cooperatives and the working groups in the four working areas in the town should immediately conduct a universal inspection of water use for spring sowing and irrigation, and any problems discovered should be resolved immediately. It was also decided that each agricultural cooperative should be responsible for the management of each section of the canals in the town, and that during the period of water release and irrigation, there should be a dedicated person responsible for supervising the canals, regularly paying attention to repairs to ensure that no faults occur, so as not to affect the timely irrigation.

    甘肃省推广十八种好方法
    提高山区灌溉技术
    盘山拦蓄桃花水，碾伯改进春灌法
    本报讯　甘肃日报消息：为了总结推广山地灌溉经验，全面掀起水利灌溉高潮，战胜干旱，力争今年农业大丰收，甘肃省农林厅水利局在武山县召开了全省（除张掖专区外）山地灌溉会议。
    这次会议是以东梁渠畔为课堂，以山地灌溉方法为教材召开的。参观了东梁渠和山地灌溉方法后，接着就地利用渠水和渠畔的各种类型的山坡陡地，亲自操作，现场实习；各地已有的灌溉经验和个人大胆设想出来的新办法，也在当场表演。以渗透均匀，减缓冲刷，便于耕作，确保增产四项标准作鉴定，大家评比。并通过大鸣大放大辩论的方法充分交流了山地灌溉经验。
    会议期间，实习和表演的灌溉方法共达三十多种，经过评比认为是行之有效可以普遍推广的有十八种。如因地制宜，分散径流，高开口，低打埝的畦灌法；东梁渠的“三快、一慢”即眼快、手快、腿快和水流慢的放水要诀等灌溉经验，受到了与会同志的称赞。
    本报讯　辽宁日报消息：辽宁省盘山县今年决定大量修筑平原水库，蓄水灌溉。计划仅此一项工程即可灌溉稻田十万亩。
    盘山县地势低洼，河流较多，是各河入海的大门。所以每逢汛期，河水暴涨暴落，特别是春季桃花水很多，每年还得防春汛，到用水灌溉时，河水下落又变成枯水河。这种局面过去一直没有改变。
    今年，全县除以沙岭为重点，利用桃花水灌溉五万三千亩水田以外，西安，胡家，田家等区全部修筑平原水库灌水，全县计划灌田十万亩。修筑平原水库的土地，灌溉完以后，仍可种植，而且还可以解决内涝问题。有些盐碱土，经过蓄水泡田后，土壤也得到改良。
    本报讯　青海日报消息：青海省碾伯镇党委书记兰德清同志等检查春耕工作中，在沙坝、杨家门等农业社发现，春播灌田中由于渠道管理不严，社员在浇田中责任心不强，用水浪费很大。如在春播灌田中，普遍采取大水漫灌，没有按照增产措施规定进行小畦细水灌溉，结果造成用水浪费。有的社员放水时没有计划，放的水很大，到处溢水，浪费很大。浇田结束后，不去原处退水，又把水流入已经冬灌过的地里，影响春播。
    镇领导上召开了社主任和各工作区工作组长会议。会上决定，为了切实作到不浪费一滴水，保证春播充足用水，要求全镇二十二个农业社和四个工作区的工作组立即普遍检查春播灌田用水情况，发现问题立即解决。并决定全镇各条渠道由各农业社分段包干管理，在放水灌田期间，应有专人负责渠道监督工作，经常注意补修，保证不发生故障，使之不影响按时灌水。（附图片）
