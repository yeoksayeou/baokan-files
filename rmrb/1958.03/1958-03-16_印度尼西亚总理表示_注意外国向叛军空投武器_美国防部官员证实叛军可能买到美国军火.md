(Combined reports from our newspaper) Xinhua News Agency reported: Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda said on the 14th that the government is paying due attention to reports that an aircraft of unknown nationality was dropping weapons over rebel areas in Central Sumatra.

Djuanda clearly stated that there had been indications of foreign countries wanting to drop weapons for a long time.

The Prime Minister said, "The rebels can buy weapons abroad, and so can we."

Meanwhile, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Suwito said that the Indonesian armed forces have taken note of the reported airdrops of weapons.

He confirmed that the government also knows the type and origin of these weapons.

On the 15th, Jakarta newspapers protested against the foreign aircraft airdropping weapons to support the rebels and demanded a thorough investigation into the matter.

The "Merdeka" (Independence) newspaper said that airdropping weapons to the rebels is a hostile act against the Indonesian government. It is now clear that the weapons are American-made, and the government should first summon the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia to ask him to clarify the matter. The newspaper also demanded that the government lodge a strong protest with the countries concerned.

The "Indonesia Torch" newspaper said that the airdropping of weapons fully confirms that the rebels have received foreign support and assistance, and the rebels are not acting alone. The newspaper demanded that the government publish detailed information and relevant materials about the airdropping of weapons.

The "Orient Star" newspaper pointed out that the airdropped anti-tank rocket launchers are exactly the same as those used by member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the aircraft airdropping the weapons were supplied by Australia, a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, although the government has not confirmed this. All of this proves that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs.

In other news, Washington reported: U.S. Department of Defense officials confirmed on the 14th that Indonesian rebel forces "may have" bought U.S. weapons and ammunition that were declared "surplus materials" on the open market. Defense Department officials attempted to downplay accusations from all sides that the United States was supplying weapons to Indonesian rebels.

    印度尼西亚总理表示
    注意外国向叛军空投武器
    美国防部官员证实叛军可能买到美国军火
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：印度尼西亚总理朱安达14日说，政府对于所传一架国籍不明的飞机在中苏门答腊叛乱地区上空投掷武器的消息正在给予应有的注意。
    朱安达清楚地表明，老早就有迹象表明外国要投武器了。
    这位总理说，“叛乱分子可以在国外购买武器，我们也可以这样做”。
    同时，外交部秘书长苏维托说，印度尼西亚武装部队已经注意到了所传空投武器的消息。
    他证实说，政府并且知道了这些武器的类型和原产地。
    雅加达各报15日对外国飞机空投武器支持叛乱分子的行动提出抗议，并且要求对这件事情进行彻底的调查。
    “独立报”说，向叛乱分子空投武器是对印度尼西亚政府的敌意行动。现在已经很清楚，武器是美国制的，政府首先应该召见美国驻印度尼西亚大使，要求他对这件事加以澄清。报纸还要求政府向有关国家提出强硬抗议。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”说，空投武器这件事充分证实，叛乱分子得到了外国的支持和援助，叛乱分子并不是单干的。这家报纸要求政府详细公布空投武器的情况和有关材料。
    “东星报”指出，空投的反战车火箭炮同东南亚条约组织成员国家所使用的完全一样，空投武器的飞机是由东南亚条约组织成员国澳大利亚供给的，虽然政府还没有证实这一点。所有这一切都证明东南亚条约组织正在干涉印度尼西亚内政。
    另据华盛顿消息：美国国防部官员14日证实，印度尼西亚叛乱部队“有可能”在公开市场上买下了被宣布为“剩余物资”的美国武器和弹药。国防部官员企图这样轻描淡写地洗刷各方面对美国供应印度尼西亚叛乱分子武器的指责。
