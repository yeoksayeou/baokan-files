Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 20th: The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee, together with delegations from Xiaogan Prefecture, Hong'an County, and Macheng County in Hubei Province, signed an agreement in Wuhan City on the 19th to cooperate with and support each other for a great leap forward together.
    Dong Biwu, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended the conference and delivered a speech. He said that both industry and agriculture are making a great leap forward, and urban support for the rural great leap forward is the result of historical development and is also necessary for the development of urban work. Wuhan has formulated a work outline and signed agreements with various counties, which is very good.
    According to the plan formulated by the sixteen counties in Xiaogan Prefecture near Wuhan City, the whole area will reach a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of grain and 100 jin of ginned cotton this year, and the tea, hemp, wood, and bamboo in the northern and southern mountainous areas and the aquatic products in the central area will double. Hong'an County is prepared to achieve semi-mechanization of agricultural production and chemical fertilization within two or three years, and establish power plants to bring electricity to every township. Macheng County will realize electrification in six townships this year. These inspiring plans have greatly encouraged the workers and staff in Wuhan City, and have also put forward many new requirements for the city. In order to support the rural areas of this prefecture and two counties to achieve a great leap forward in production, the newly signed agreement stipulates that Wuhan City will directly supply Xiaogan Prefecture with more than 20,000 sets of various steam engines, walking plows, water pumps, threshing machines, and other agricultural machinery and power equipment; the city and the prefectural government will jointly run two chemical fertilizer plants with an annual output of 40,000 tons, assist various counties in establishing bacterial fertilizer plants, granular fertilizer plants, and biogas power stations, and assist the entire prefecture in establishing 35 small hydropower stations. The Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering will be responsible for first experimenting with the complete mechanization of power, field farming, water conservancy irrigation, and transportation in an agricultural cooperative. After the experiment is successful, it will be promoted in various counties. Wuhan City will also supply Hong'an and Macheng counties with various agricultural machinery and equipment; help Hong'an County build two pumping stations that can irrigate about 10,000 mu; assist Macheng County in establishing four small hydropower stations, and the Electric Power Bureau will be responsible for helping the county complete the construction of the power transmission project in six townships, from surveying, design, manpower allocation, construction and installation, to realize electrification. Wuhan City also has specific provisions for supporting these areas in culture, health, and other aspects. At the same time, Wuhan City also organized more than ten large factories and enterprises in the Wuhan area, such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, Yangtze River Shipping Department, and Heavy Machine Tool Plant, to directly link up with the sixteen counties of Xiaogan Prefecture, the agricultural tool factory of the prefecture, and Hong'an and Macheng counties, mainly to help build and expand the agricultural tool factories in various counties, and to provide support in other aspects as much as possible, such as taking time to go to the countryside to repair machinery and equipment for farmers, and training technical backbones.
    Representatives from Xiaogan Prefecture and Hong'an and Macheng counties guaranteed that in addition to completing the allocation plan stipulated by the province, they would also vigorously support Wuhan City, such as supplying agricultural and sideline products, industrial raw materials, etc. Xiaogan Prefecture is prepared to supply Wuhan City with 50,000 live pigs, 70,000 dan of fresh fish, 1.5 million nan bamboo poles, 14,000 cubic meters of fir wood, and a large number of chickens, ducks, fresh eggs, firewood, and charcoal throughout the year outside the plan. Hong'an and Macheng counties will also supply Wuhan City with a large number of non-staple foods and local specialties.
    On the 19th, Wuhan City also officially announced the city's 1958 work outline for comprehensively supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production. The outline stipulates that it is necessary to support the rural areas of Hubei Province from the economic, technical, cultural, and other aspects.
Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 20th: Taking cities as the center and carrying out large-scale urban-rural cooperation by region is an important measure taken by Henan Province in the great leap forward of industry and agriculture.
    According to the decision of the urban-rural cooperation conference recently convened by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, six provincial-level cities, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xinxiang, Kaifeng, Anyang, and Jiaozuo, will respectively help Xuchang, Yanshi, Xinxiang, Shangqiu, Anyang, and other twelve counties and suburban districts to realize agricultural mechanization this year. It is also proposed that mechanization be achieved in four aspects: water conservancy, farming, field transportation, and processing of agricultural and sideline products, as the standard for agricultural mechanization.
    In order to rapidly develop local industries run by prefectures and counties, cities are responsible for providing comprehensive assistance, first of all, technical assistance. Luoyang City decided to equip each of the fourteen counties in Luoyang Prefecture with a county industry minister with industrial knowledge and a secondary technician, and provide the drawings and technical information needed for industrial development, and help with the design, exploration, testing, processing of machine parts, and quality appraisal of new products. Zhengzhou City decided that in addition to meeting the needs of Xuchang, Nanyang, and Xinyang prefectures for 1,852 various machine tools and 9,620 boiler tractors and gas generators, it would also train more than 1,000 apprentices on their behalf.
    At the meeting, the prefectures and counties put forward plans to support the cities, ensuring the provision of a large amount of building materials and industrial raw materials to support urban construction, and supplying the cities with more vegetables, pork, and other non-staple foods; in the development of prefectural and county-run industries, they will not compete with the cities for industrial raw materials.

    发挥工人阶级领导作用巩固工农联盟
    城市农村大协作
    武汉郑州等城市同邻近农村互相支援
    据新华社武汉20日电　武汉市人民委员会同湖北省孝感专区、红安县、麻城县三个代表团，19日在武汉市签订了一个互相协作互相支援共同大跃进的协议书。
    中共中央政治局委员董必武参加了这个大会，并在会上讲了话。他说，工农业都在大跃进，城市支援农村大跃进正是历史发展的结果，对于城市工作的发展也是必要的。武汉市订了工作纲要并同各县签订了协议书，这就很好。
    根据靠近武汉市的孝感专区全区十六个县制定的规划，今年全区要达到亩产粮食千斤，皮棉百斤，在南北山区的茶、麻、木、竹，中部的水产都要翻一番。红安县准备在两三年内达到农业生产半机械化、肥料化学化，建立发电站使乡乡有电灯。麻城县今年就要在六个乡实现电气化。这些振奋人心的规划大大鼓舞了武汉市的职工，同时也对城市提出了许许多多新的要求。为了支援这个专区和两个县的农村实现生产大跃进，新签订的协议书规定，武汉市将直接供应孝感专区各种蒸气机、步犁、水泵、打谷机等农业机械和动力设备共两万多部；由市和专署合办年产四万吨的化学肥料厂两个，协助各县建立细菌肥料厂、颗粒肥料厂、沼气发电站各一个，协助全专区建立小型水力发电站三十五个。并由武汉市机电局负责，先在一个农业社里试验从动力、田间耕作、水利灌溉、交通运输等方面全部机械化的作法，试验成功后，在各县推广。武汉市还将供应红安、麻城两县多种农业机械设备；帮助红安县建设能灌溉一万亩左右的抽水机站两个；协助麻城县建立小型水电站四个，由电业局负责从勘测、设计、人力配备、施工安装等方面帮助这个县在六个乡完成输电工程的建设，实现电气化。武汉市对这些地区的文化、卫生等方面的支援，也有具体规定。同时，武汉市还组织在武汉地区的武钢、长江航运部门、重型机床厂等十多个大型工厂企业，分别同孝感专区的十六个县、专区农具厂以及红安、麻城两县直接挂钩，以帮助新建、扩建各县农具厂为主，并尽可能的进行其他方面的支援：如抽出时间下乡为农民修理机械设备；培训技术骨干力量等。
    孝感专区和红安、麻城两县的代表保证：在完成省里规定的调拨计划以外，还要大力支援武汉市，如供应农副产品、工业原料等。孝感专区准备在计划外，全年供应武汉市生猪五万头，鲜鱼七万担，楠竹一百五十万根，杉木一万四千立方公尺和大批鸡鸭、鲜蛋、木柴、木炭等。红安、麻城两县也将大量供应武汉市副食品和土特产品。
    武汉市19日还正式公布了这个市1958年全面支援农业生产大跃进的工作纲要。纲要规定要从经济上、技术上、文化上及其他各个方面支援湖北省农村。
    本报特约新华社郑州20日电　以城市为中心分片进行城乡大协作，这是河南省在工农业大跃进中采取的一项重要措施。
    根据中共河南省委最近召开的城乡协作会议的决定，郑州、洛阳、新乡、开封、安阳、焦作六个省辖市，将分别帮助许昌、偃师、新乡、商丘、安阳等十二个县和市郊区今年实现农业机械化。并且提出：以水利、耕作、田间运输、农副产品加工等四个方面达到机械化，为农业机械化的标准。
    为了迅速地发展专区和县营的地方工业，城市负责给予全面的援助，首先是在技术方面的援助。洛阳市决定，给洛阳专区的十四个县每县配备一个有工业知识的县工业部长和一个中等技术人员，并且供给发展工业中需要的图纸、技术资料，帮助设计、勘探、化验、加工机器部件、新产品质量鉴定等工作。郑州市决定，除了满足许昌、南阳、信阳三个专区需要的各种机床一千八百五十二台、锅驼机和煤气机九千六百二十台的要求以外，并还代为培养训练徒工一千多名。
    在会议上，各专、县都提出了支援城市的计划，保证提供大量的建筑材料和工业原料来支援城市建设，并且以更多的蔬菜、猪肉等副食品供应城市；在发展专、县营工业当中，不跟城市相争工业原料。
