Xinhua News Agency, Huangshi, 29th: After three days and two nights of hard work, learning from the advanced experiences of fraternal countries, the employees of Daye Steel Plant successfully test-produced mixed steel using electric furnace steel and converter steel on the afternoon of the 28th. The steel cast using a mixture of three tons of electric furnace steel and four tons of converter steel all exceeded the national quality standards for high-quality steel.

The success of Daye Steel Plant in testing mixed converter and electric furnace steel is another new technical achievement in China's steelmaking industry. "Mixed steelmaking" means pouring the already refined converter steel and electric furnace steel into a steel ladle and mixing them for casting. Currently, most of China's high-quality steel is produced by electric furnaces. Converter steel is of lower quality and can only be used for general building materials and agricultural tools. After using mixed electric furnace steel and converter steel, the quality of converter steel can be changed from ordinary steel to high-quality steel. This will not only greatly increase the output of high-quality steel but also reduce costs.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 29th: Following the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, the large open-hearth furnace workshop of Chongqing Steel Company successfully tested three-trough steel tapping on the 27th. The cast steel ingots are of qualified quality.

After this workshop successfully adopted the three-trough steel tapping method, the furnace output increased from more than seventy tons when single-trough steel tapping was used to one hundred and fourteen tons. According to the factory's technicians, it is expected to increase to one hundred and twenty-five tons soon.

Although the furnace output of Chongqing Steel Company's large open-hearth furnace has great potential, it still cannot be increased quickly due to the limitations of the crane, steel ladle capacity, and volume. After adopting three-trough steel tapping, in addition to the original large cranes and large steel ladles, the workshop also utilized two other small cranes and old small steel ladles. This solved the original problem of insufficient steel tapping capacity, allowing the potential of the open-hearth furnace to be greatly exploited.

### 大冶钢厂混合炼钢成功  重庆钢铁公司用三槽出钢

    大冶钢厂混合炼钢成功
    重庆钢铁公司用三槽出钢
    据新华社黄石29日电　大冶钢厂职工学习兄弟国家先进经验，经过三天两夜的苦战，在28日下午试用电炉钢水和转炉钢水混合炼钢，已经成功。这次试验采用三吨电炉钢水和四吨转炉钢水混合浇铸出来的钢，质量都超过了国家规定的优质钢标准。
    大冶钢厂试验转炉和电炉钢水混合炼钢成功，是我国炼钢工业方面的又一新的技术成就。所谓“混合炼钢”就是把已经炼好的转炉钢水，同电炉钢水一起倾入一个钢包中混合浇铸。目前我国的优质钢大都由电炉炼出，转炉钢的质量低，只能用它作一般建筑材料和农具。采用电炉钢水和转炉钢水混合炼钢以后，就可使转炉钢的质量由普通钢变为优质钢。这样不但可大大提高优质钢的产量，也可降低成本。
    据新华社重庆29日电　重庆钢铁公司大型平炉车间继太原钢铁厂之后，已在27日试验成功三槽出钢。浇成的钢锭质量合格。
    这个车间采用三槽出钢方法成功后，炉产量己由原来单槽出钢时的七十多吨提高到一百一十四吨。据这个厂的技术人员预计，不久就可以提高到一百二十五吨。
    重庆钢铁公司的大型平炉的炉产量虽然潜力很大，但受吊车、盛钢桶能力和容量的限制，仍然不能很快提高。采用三槽出钢后，这个车间除用原来的大吊车和大盛钢桶外，还把另外两个小吊车和旧的小盛钢桶也利用起来。这样就解决了原来的出钢水能力不足的问题，使平炉潜力大大发挥。
