    Grasp Measures—The Current Key
    Zhejiang and Jiangsu Combine Rectification of Communes to Implement Planning Down to Every Plot of Land and Every Person
    (Our Dispatch) Zhejiang Province is intensifying the rectification of agricultural cooperatives around the spring plowing preparation work, so that agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have sufficient combat effectiveness to invest in the great leap forward in spring plowing production.
    Since the comprehensive launch of grass-roots rectification in rural Zhejiang Province, the rectification of cooperatives, the Party, and the League have been taken as the central content of the rectification movement. In the rectification of cooperatives, the formulation of production plans, the improvement of business management, and the rectification of organizations are taken as the main contents. At present, most of the 35,800-plus agricultural cooperatives in the province have formulated great leap forward production plans and increased production measures. The enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high, and the attendance rate of many cooperatives has reached 100%. However, some areas have found that when formulating production plans, many cooperatives did not carry out extensive airing of views among the masses, but only raised targets from top to bottom. The plans did not take root among the masses and did not become the conscious fighting goals of the masses. There are also a small number of cooperatives whose production plans have not met with the masses at all. Many members have a situation of "plans are made as they are, production is done as it is." The members believe that the leap forward targets are just to boost morale.
    In order to correct the above phenomenon, all localities regard vigorously promoting the advanced experience of "three guarantees and four assignments to the field" and "knowing the whole year early" as the main measures to make production plans take root, and as the main content of improving business management. According to incomplete statistics from Ningbo, Jinhua, Jiande and other special districts, 1,329 cooperatives have implemented the "three guarantees and four assignments to the field", more than 4,600 cooperatives are implementing it, and more than 2,000 cooperatives have already carried out or are carrying out "knowing the whole year early."
    In carrying out this work, all localities generally pay attention to mobilizing the masses to extensively air views, debate, and contend, overcome conservative ideas, and revise production plans through comparing output, comparing highs and lows, tapping potential, and finding reasons. The great leap forward targets and measures are set to the production teams and to each plot of field, so that the production plan takes root on every member and everyone has a responsibility. Members reflect: In the past, a few cadres carried the burden of increasing production, but now everyone is carrying the heavy burden.
    At present, a small number of cooperatives that have implemented "three guarantees and four assignments to the field" and "knowing the whole year early" are rectifying Party, League, and cooperative organizations and carrying out spring plowing production competitions. These cooperatives generally produce during the day and hold meetings at night, and first solve the urgent problems in production during the rectification of the cooperative.
    All localities pay special attention to the rectification of the three types of cooperatives. According to statistics from the base point townships in the counties of the seven special districts of Jinhua, Ningbo, Jiande, and Jiaxing, after rectification, three-quarters of the three types of cooperatives have risen to the second or first types, and some backward cooperatives have become advanced cooperatives.
    (Our Dispatch) According to a report from the Xinhua Daily News: The vast rural areas of Jiangsu Province are closely combining the current production upsurge to comprehensively promote the rectification movement of the Party and communes. According to statistics from more than 29,000 cooperatives in 73 counties and cities in the province, more than 15,000 cooperatives have joined this movement. In Yancheng Special District, where progress is faster, 95% of the cooperatives have joined the rectification movement of the Party and communes.
    The rectification of the Party and communes in various places generally adopts the method of combining current production, first airing views, then rectifying, and then debating. The more practical and effective steps of airing views and debating in the rectification of the Party and communes are: starting from discussing the production plan, mobilizing the masses to extensively air views and debate, present favorable conditions, present various difficulties, and inspect and revise the production plan, targets, measures, and the "three guarantees and four assignments to the field" plan.
    The Guanghua Agricultural Cooperative of Fengyu Township, Yangzhou County, launched a mass airing of views and debates on this year's production plan around the current management of the three wheat crops and the preparation for spring plowing, and carried out ideological struggles between advanced and backward, leap forward and gradual progress, and poor preparation and rich preparation. It greatly stimulated the political enthusiasm of the members. All laborers attended work, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated in more than ten days exceeded five and a half times that of the first half of the month. One-third of the second- and third-class wheat fields were eliminated.
    In order to solve the time arrangement problem of rectification and production, various places generally adopted the method of producing during the day and rectifying the Party and communes at night. Lishui County also adopted the method of using work sites and field rest time, airing views while producing, and airing views in shifts by teams. Therefore, in the case of tight production tasks, it can still achieve simultaneous high tides in rectification and production. In order to adapt to the situation of simultaneous high tides in rectification and production, Party committees at all levels have also paid attention to improving their work style and methods, and generally adhered to the methods of the first secretary taking command, assigning special personnel in charge, clearly assigning tasks, allocating capable cadres, demarcating areas for fixed cooperatives, and contracting to the end.

### 抓措施——当前的关键  浙江江苏结合整社把规划贯彻到每块地每个人

    抓措施——当前的关键
    浙江江苏结合整社把规划贯彻到每块地每个人
    本报讯　浙江省正围绕备耕工作加紧进行整顿农业社，以便全省农业社有着充沛的战斗力投入大跃进的春耕生产。
    浙江省农村全面开展基层整风以来，都以整社、整党、整团作为整风的中心内容。在整社中又抓住制订生产计划、改善经营管理、整顿组织作为主要内容。目前全省三万五千八百多个农业社大部分已制订出大跃进的生产规划和增产措施，生产情绪空前高涨，许多社出勤率达到100％。但是部分地区发现很多社在制订生产规划时，没有在群众中开展大放大鸣、只是自上而下的提指标，计划没有在群众中落脚生根，没有成为群众自觉的奋斗目标。也有少数社的生产规划根本没有和群众见面，很多社员存在着“规划订管订，生产做管做”的情况，社员认为跃进指标只是打打气的。
    为了纠正上述现象，各地都把大力推行“三包四到田”、“一年早知道”先进经验作为使生产规划落脚生根的主要措施，作为改善经营管理的主要内容。据宁波、金华、建德等专区不完全统计，已有一千三百二十九个社推行了“三包四到田”，有四千六百多个社正在推行；有两千多个社已经或正在搞“一年早知道”。
    各地在进行这一工作中，一般都注意发动群众大放大鸣大争、通过摆产量、比高低、挖潜力、找原因，克服保守思想，修订了生产规划。把大跃进的指标和措施订到生产队，订到每丘田里；使生产规划在每个社员身上落脚生根，做到了人人有责任。社员们反映：过去增产担子几个干部挑，现在千斤担子大家挑了。
    目前少数已经推行“三包四到田”、“一年早知道”的社，正在整顿党、团、社组织，开展春耕生产竞赛。这些社一般都白天生产，晚上开会，在整社中首先解决生产中的迫切问题。
    各地特别注意三类社的整顿工作。据金华、宁波、建德、嘉兴等七个专区各县的基点乡统计，经过整顿，四分之三的三类社都上升为二类社或一类社，有的落后社已经成为先进社。
    本报讯　据新华日报消息：江苏省广大农村正紧密结合当前生产高潮，全面推进整风整社运动。据全省七十三个县市二万九千多个社的统计，已有一万五千多个社投入这一运动。进展较快的盐城专区，投入整风整社的社已达95％。
    各地的整风整社，一般都采取了结合当前生产，先鸣放、后整改、再辩论的方法。整风整社的鸣放辩论，比较切实有效的步骤是：从讨论生产规划入手，发动群众大鸣大放，摆有利条件，摆各种困难，检查修订生产规划、指标、措施和“三包四到田”的方案。
    扬中县丰裕乡光华农业社围绕当前三麦管理和备耕工作，发动群众对今年的生产规划大鸣大放大辩论，进行先进与落后，跃进与渐进，穷备耕与富备耕的思想斗争。大大激发了社员的政治积极性，所有劳力全部出勤，十多天的积肥量超过了前半月的五倍半，二、三类麦田消灭了三分之一。
    为了解决整风和生产的时间安排问题，各地一般都采取了白天生产、晚上整风整社的办法。溧水县并采取了利用工地、田头休息时间，边生产、边鸣放和分队轮流鸣放的办法，因而在生产任务较紧的情况下，仍能做到整风生产两高涨。各级党委为了适应整风生产同时高涨的形势，还注意改进了工作作风和工作方法，一般都坚持了第一书记挂帅、确定专人负责、明确交代任务、配备得力干部、划片定社、包干到底的方法。
