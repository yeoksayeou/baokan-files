    Party Discipline Inspection Cadres Should Also Be Good Promoters
    Yi Huai
    The situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward requires cadres in all aspects of the Party to be promoters, and cadres engaged in discipline inspection work should naturally also make themselves promoters. This means eliminating various obstacles in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction and transforming negative factors into positive factors in the process of implementing Party discipline.
    The Third National Party Discipline Inspection Work Conference has already made a decision, requiring discipline inspection work to realize a comprehensive Great Leap Forward, and requiring discipline inspection cadres to be good promoters. This conference pointed out that in 1958, the focus of Party discipline inspection work should be on investigating and handling cases within the Party that belong to the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism, cases that undermine the Party's unity and unification, and cases that endanger the national economy, and opposing various violations of law and discipline. These are precisely the serious obstacles in the current Great Leap Forward. Where these obstacles exist and cannot be eliminated in time, there will be no smooth leap forward. It is the glorious task of discipline inspection cadres in the Great Leap Forward to promptly deal with these problems through Party discipline inspection work, overcome the negative factors in the movement, give play to the positive factors, or transform negative factors into positive factors.
    Some comrades may feel that everyone is now going all out and striving for the top, and everywhere is a thriving new atmosphere. Where are there so many negative factors? When some comrades think this way, they have forgotten that we are still in a period of transition, and have not seen that the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism is still continuing, and that this struggle will inevitably be reflected in our Party. These comrades have also not seen that we still have enemies at home and abroad, and have overlooked the inevitability and long-term nature of the enemy's sabotage of the Party. The corruption of bourgeois ideology and the sabotage of the enemy will inevitably lead to the emergence of some negative factors in our Party, even as positive factors rise higher and higher. Although these negative factors are only one or half a finger out of ten fingers compared to the large number of positive factors, their harm to the Party and the people's cause cannot be ignored. If we only rejoice in the current favorable situation and do not pay attention to overcoming these negative factors, our Party's cause will suffer losses.
    To be good promoters, Party discipline inspection cadres need to make a Great Leap Forward in political thought and working methods. Party discipline inspection work must, based on the current political situation and closely around the Party's tasks, proceed from reality, determine the main goals of the struggle, put forward specific work tasks, and at the same time, grasp political and ideological leadership, and always pay attention to the development and changes of the political situation and the ideological trends inside and outside the Party, and promptly criticize various deviations and erroneous understandings in discipline inspection work. The Party's discipline inspection organizations should carry out mass line under the unified leadership of the Party committee, implement handling cases by the whole Party, and make full use of the methods of big contending, big blooming, big debate, and big-character posters, so that the leadership is combined with the masses, and the special organs are combined with the mass movement. In handling cases, it is necessary to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, be ruthless to the enemy, and be gentle to comrades; have a comprehensive view of problems, and pay special attention to distinguishing between the problem of "nine fingers" and the problem of "one finger." For comrades who have made mistakes within the Party, it is necessary to be realistic, to expose and struggle against mistakes, and to conduct a comprehensive investigation, to see both their shortcomings and mistakes, and to see their advantages and achievements, not to attack one point without considering the rest. For the work of a place or an organ, it is also necessary to have a global view, distinguish between the overall situation and the small situation, the general and the individual, so as to avoid the shortcomings and errors of not paying attention to the whole picture.

    党的监察工作干部也应该当好促进派
    易槐
    全国大跃进的形势要求党的各个方面的干部都要作促进派，监察工作的干部，自然也要使自己成为促进派。这就是在执行党的纪律的过程中，扫除社会主义建设事业大跃进中的各种障碍，化大跃进中的消极因素为积极因素。
    第三次全国党的监察工作会议已经作出了决定，要求监察工作实现全面大跃进，要求监察工作干部当好促进派。这次会议指出，1958年党的监察工作要着重检查处理党内那些属于资本主义和社会主义两条道路斗争的案件、破坏党的团结和统一的案件、危害国民经济的案件，反对各种违法乱纪行为。这些，正是目前大跃进中的严重障碍，那里有这些障碍而不能及时清除，那里就不能顺利地向前跃进。通过党的监察工作及时处理这些问题，克服运动中的消极因素，发挥积极因素，或者化消极因素为积极因素，这正是监察工作干部在大跃进中的光荣任务。
    有些同志会觉得，现在大家都在鼓足干劲力争上游，到处是一片欣欣向荣的新气象，那里有那么多的消极因素呢？当有些同志这样想的时候，他们已经忘记了我们还处在过渡时期，没有看到资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争还在继续着，而且这种斗争必然要反映到我们党内来。这些同志也没有看到我们还有国内外敌人，忽略了敌人破坏党的必然性和长期性。资产阶级思想的腐蚀和敌人的破坏，在我们党内积极因素越来越高涨昂扬的同时，不可避免地还会出现一些消极因素。比起大量的积极因素，虽然，这些消极因素只不过是十个手指头中的一个或者半个手指头，可是，它对党对人民事业的危害性却不容忽视。如果我们只为当前的有利形势欢欣鼓舞，而不去注意克服这些消极因素，就会使我们党的事业受到损失。
    要当好促进派，需要党的监察工作干部在政治思想、工作方法上来一个大跃进。党的监察工作要根据当前的政治形势，密切围绕党的任务，从实际出发，确定斗争的主要目标，提出具体工作任务，同时要抓紧政治思想领导，经常注意政治形势的发展变化和党内外思想动态，及时批判监察工作中的各种偏向和错误认识。党的监察组织检查处理案件要在党委的统一领导下，贯彻群众路线，实行全党办案，充分利用大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报的方法，使领导同群众相结合，专门机关同群众运动相结合。在处理案件时要分清敌我，对敌人要狠，对同志要和；看问题要有全面观点，特别注意区别是“九个指头”的问题，还是“一个指头”的问题。对党内犯错误的同志，要实事求是，既要对错误进行揭发斗争，又要进行全面考察，既看到他们的缺点错误，又要看到他们的优点和成绩，不要攻其一点不及其余，对一个地方、一个机关的工作也要有全局观点，区别大局和小局，一般和个别，以免发生不注意全貌的缺点和错误。
