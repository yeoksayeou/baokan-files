Changing a Light Bulb
    Peng Bowang
    "The old Yuan's next door shines so brightly at night. We should buy a bigger one," Old Wang's wife said again, complaining that the public-issued light bulb was too small. Compared to others, it felt like they were getting the short end of the stick.

    "Let's wait until it breaks!" Old Wang had been putting her off like this for over a year, but the light bulb stubbornly refused to break. Furthermore, the electricity bill had slightly increased starting from January this year. This time, the woman couldn't wait any longer and said she was going to the department store to buy a bigger one herself.

    "I'll go buy it," Old Wang said, concerned.

    The anti-waste campaign was in full swing. The factory even held an exhibition, which Old Wang visited. He stared at a chart for a long time. It turned out that the chart calculated a detailed account: Starting this year, although rent and utilities had increased, the two combined were still not enough to cover the expenses in utilities!

    Old Wang's heart thumped when he saw the chart. He abandoned the idea of going to the department store to buy a light bulb. When he returned home, his wife was again complaining about why he didn't buy a light bulb. "Let's go buy it together after dinner." His wife was very satisfied with this answer.

    After dinner, the couple went to the department store together. Old Wang suggested going to see the exhibition first, and his wife agreed. Old Wang stopped in front of the same chart and explained its contents to her, even relating it to his life before and after liberation. His wife just nodded and pondered.

    Coming out of the exhibition, she seemed to have forgotten about buying a light bulb and kept walking towards home. Old Wang followed behind.

    As soon as she entered the house, she switched on the light and called to Old Wang: "The light bulb issued by the public is not small at all. Look, isn't it quite bright?"

    "Yes, as long as your heart is bright, the light bulb will also be bright." As soon as Old Wang said this, the couple laughed.

    换灯泡
    彭博望
    “隔壁老袁家晚上照得亮堂堂的，我们家还是去买个大的好”。老王的爱人又提起了要换灯泡；她嫌公家发的灯泡太小，比起人家来，好像吃了亏似的。
    “等它坏了再说吧！”老王这样的回答，算是敷衍一年多了，灯泡偏偏不坏。从今年元月起，电费还略有增加呢。这回女人可等不下去了，说自己准备去百货商店买个大的回来。
    “还是我去买吧”。老王这样关照着。
    反浪费的火烧起来了，厂里还举办了一个展览会，老王去参观。他在一张图表面前注视了很久，原来那张图表算了这样一笔细账：从今年起，房租、水电费虽然有所增加，但二者加起来，还不够水电方面的开支！
    老王看了这张图表，心里扑通扑通直跳，打消了去百货商店买灯泡的念头。回到家里，老婆又在怪他为什么不买灯泡回来！“吃完晚饭一块儿去买吧”。老婆听了他这样的回答，感到很满意。
    晚饭吃完了，俩口子一同去百货商店。老王的意见要先去看展览会，老婆也就依了。老王仍在那张图表面前停了下来，并给她讲解图表的内容，还联系到自己解放前后的生活对比，老婆只是点头和沉思。
    从展览会出来，她好像忘了买灯泡这件事，一直往回家的路上走，老王在后面跟着。
    她一进门，就扭开电灯，叫着老王：“公家发的灯泡并不小啊，你看，不是蛮亮的吗？”
    “是呀，只要心里亮了，灯泡也就亮了。”老王这么一说，俩口子都笑了。
