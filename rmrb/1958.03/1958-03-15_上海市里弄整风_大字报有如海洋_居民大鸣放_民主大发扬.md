    Shanghai Lane and Alley Rectification Campaign: Big-Character Posters Like an Ocean; Residents Speak Out Freely, Democracy Greatly Promoted
    (Our dispatch) A lane and alley rectification movement aimed at exposing the "three bad tendencies" and conducting socialist education among residents has been launched with great fervor among more than 1.3 million residents in Shanghai. As one enters the lanes and alleys, one can see colorful, dazzling, and densely packed big-character posters. These millions of big-character posters have put forward many active and enthusiastic criticisms and suggestions on the work of Party and government organs, mass organizations, and institutions and enterprises from all aspects.
    The rectification campaign among residents of Shanghai's lanes and alleys began after the mobilization broadcast rally on the night of March 8. As soon as the mobilization broadcast rally ended, residents of various lanes and alleys rushed to write big-character posters overnight, and flowers immediately bloomed in every corner of the city. The residents' enthusiasm was very high. Many people had prepared their opinions long ago, and as soon as the horn of rectification was sounded, they immediately wrote them out. Old Man Zhu, a military dependent in Dajing Lane, Yimiao District, works at a water station and has a lot of contact with the working people. He listed 36 targets of units, people, and things he encountered on weekdays in his notebook. At the beginning of the lane and alley rectification campaign, he worked day and night to write 1,250 big-character posters targeting these objects.
    Residents in many lanes and alleys also launched friendly competitions in writing big-character posters. Lin Di, a resident of Yongping Lane on Ningbo Road, originally planned to write 100 big-character posters, but when she heard that another resident, Wu Yixin, was going to write 150, she immediately increased hers to 200. Wu Yixin closely followed, changing his to 200 as well. More than 840 shock brigades were formed by the city's youth. On the one hand, they fought hard overnight, taking the lead in writing big-character posters; on the other hand, they also actively helped residents write big-character posters, ensuring that people were available when needed. Many illiterate people and elderly people were also enthusiastic. Resident Li Heying, with the help of her husband and children, rushed to write more than 300 big-character posters overnight. The people's political enthusiasm is so high, and the number of big-character posters has increased dramatically, truly like butterflies flying and flowers dancing. Many lanes and alleys have become oceans of big-character posters.
    According to incomplete statistics, as of the evening of March 9, residents in various districts had posted approximately 2.5 million big-character posters. The content of these big-character posters is rich and colorful, making in-depth exposures and criticisms of the government's work, the "three bad tendencies" of cadres, and the "five airs". Some criticized cadres for not being thorough in their work style, not having enough contact with the masses, and having a rigid attitude towards the masses; some raised opinions on the city's material supply and environmental hygiene; some suggested banning gambling and strengthening social security work... For example, He Meizhu, a young woman resident in Xuhui District, criticized a cadre of the District Communist Youth League Committee, saying: "When the district comes to contact us, they see the masses but say nothing, just smile. When the masses argue about problems, they sit in the corner. When the situation is presented before them, they express no opinion. When problems arise, they say it's nothing special, offering no help to us, and then return to the district." A big-character poster from the Xingfu Residents' Committee in Changning District criticized that "the briquettes produced by the Municipal Coal Construction Company are loose and broken," "why do you have to queue up to buy bean sprouts in the vegetable market if you don't buy pickles at the same time," and "district people's representatives don't contact the masses," and so on.
    The municipal and district relevant authorities attach great importance to these well-intentioned criticisms and suggestions from the residents. Not only have they sent a large number of cadres to read the big-character posters, but some departments have also adopted the method of going deep into the scene and immediately rectifying the problems. The Zhangjiazhai West Section Residents' Committee in the New Urban Area posted nearly 7,000 big-character posters in three days. The lane and alley rectification and reform team composed of 14 units, including the District Public Security Bureau, the Civil Affairs Section, and the Real Estate Company, quickly went deep into this lane and alley to carry out on-site rectification, and gave satisfactory answers to most of the big-character posters in one afternoon. For example, when someone criticized why the public houses rented to the masses were not repaired when they leaked, the repair personnel immediately stated that they guaranteed to repair the houses within five days. This resolute and swift rectification approach was deeply welcomed by the residents and caused a sensation throughout the lane and alley. Resident Yu Xiaobao had already asked someone to write more than 50 big-character posters. After seeing the government workers' determined attitude to rectify, he wrote eight more big-character posters and sent them to the Residents' Committee. She said: "The government departments are seriously rectifying, and we residents will write seriously."

    上海市里弄整风　大字报有如海洋
    居民大鸣放　民主大发扬
    本报讯　一个以揭发三个坏主义和在居民中进行社会主义教育的里弄整风运动，已经在上海市一百三十多万居民中热火朝天地展开了。人们只要走进里弄，就可以看见五彩缤纷的、琳琅满目的、密密层层的大字报。这些数以百万计的大字报，从各方面对党政机关、群众团体和事业企业部门的工作提出了许多积极热情的批评和建议。
    上海市里弄居民的整风，是在3月8日夜晚的动员广播大会以后开始的。动员广播大会刚一结束，各个里弄的居民就漏夜赶写大字报，鲜花立刻开遍了全市的每一个角落。居民们的热情都很高，许多人早就准备好了意见，当动员整风的号角一响，立即就写了出来。邑庙区大境弄的军属朱老伯在给水站工作，和劳动人民的接触多。他把平日所接触的单位、人、事在本子上排出三十六个对象，里弄整风一开始，就夜以继日地针对这些对象写了一千二百五十张大字报。
    许多里弄的居民，还展开了写大字报的友谊竞赛。宁波路永平里的居民林娣，原准备写大字报一百张，但听到另一居民吴挹新要写一百五十张，她立即加到二百张时，而吴挹新也紧紧跟上，改成要写二百张。全市的青年成立了八百四十多个突击队，一方面漏夜奋战，带头写大字报；另一方面还积极帮助居民代写大字报，做到要人有人、随叫随到。许多不识字的人和老年人也热情奔放，居民李荷英就在她爱人和孩子的帮助之下，连夜赶写了三百多张大字报。人民群众的政治热情是这样地高昂，大字报的数量也就飞跃增加，真是像蝶飞花舞一般，许多里弄都成了大字报的海洋。
    据不完全的统计，截至3月9日晚上为止，各区居民已贴出约二百五十万张大字报。这些大字报的内容丰富多彩，对政府工作、干部的三个坏主义和“五气”作了深入的揭发和批评。有些批评干部的作风不深入、联系群众不够、对群众的态度生硬的；有对城市的物资供应和环境卫生提意见的；有建议取缔赌博，加强社会治安工作的……。如徐汇区居民青年妇女贺美珠，批评团区委的一个干部说：“区上来联系，见了群众面，不言又不语，只是笑嘻嘻，群众争问题，他坐角落里，情况摆眼前，他不表意见，问题发生了，他说不稀奇，毫无帮助伲，仍回区上去。”长宁区幸福居民委员会的大字报，批评“市煤建公司出产的煤球又松又碎”，“菜市场买黄豆芽为什么不搭买咸菜的就要排队”，“区人民代表不联系群众”，等等。
    对于居民的这些善意的批评和建议，市、区各有关机关都非常重视，不但派出大批干部去看大字报，而且有些部门还采取了深入现场、立即整改的办法。新城区张家宅西段居民委员会，三天内就贴出了近七千张大字报。区公安局、民政科、房地产公司等十四个单位组成的里弄整风整改队伍，很快就深入到这个里弄进行现场整改，一个下午就对大部分大字报作出了满意的答复。如有人批评租给群众住的公房为什么漏了不修理，修理人员当场就表示，保证在五天之内把房修好。这种坚决迅速整改的作法，深受居民欢迎，轰动了整个里弄。居民于小宝已经请人代写了五十多张大字报，在看到政府工作人员坚决改的态度以后，又写了八张大字报送到居民委员会。她说：“政府部门认真的改，我们居民就认真的写。”
