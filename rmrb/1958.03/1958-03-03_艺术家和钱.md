	Artists and Money
	Qí Dōngyě

	In the past, artists were ashamed to talk about money, considering it a trivial matter, and haggling over it would damage their reputation for purity and loftiness. Thus, Wang Yifu of the Jin Dynasty's saying about "that stuff" was praised by later generations. It seems this trend still has some influence today, and it clearly contradicts our era's style of building the country through diligence and thrift.

	It is reported that many artistic groups are inspecting waste, and many cases are shocking: the performance cost of a play often amounts to thousands or even tens of thousands; the actors' jewelry must be real, and the quilts for the props must be made of silk. The situation in film is even more serious: a set costs thousands of yuan but is only seen in one or two shots, the female lead has to change a dozen or twenty outfits in a film, or the money is simply given to the actors to "buy whatever they want." In Shanghai, the trend of opera troupes pursuing luxurious sets has also begun to rise, dazzling the audience and leaving the actors with no room to maneuver... It seems the quality of a play or film depends on how much money is spent. Moreover, before the rectification, this extravagant trend of being detached from real life and spending money lavishly rarely attracted the attention of the leaders of the units. And, vaguely, it seems that the "purity" of not talking about money is again at work, which is very undesirable!

	Can money not be spent or spent less? Yes! If less money is spent, will the artistic appeal be reduced? No! The question is whether one is willing to use one's brain, whether one is willing to consider using very little material to achieve very good results as part of the artistic creation. Here are two examples that can be learned from:

	Those who have seen the Soviet ballet "Don Quixote" will be amazed by the richness and variety of the sets. However, many of the scenes that create a three-dimensional impression are painted (the corner tower of the Spanish hotel is a prominent example); many of the jewelry that looks crystal clear from a distance are actually very cheap things up close. Naturally, there may be differences in the performance styles of ballets, plays, and operas, but the ingenuity, the effort to create artistic effects through artistic creation rather than money, should be applicable to any stage performance.

	When we watch the Japanese films "Wolf" and "Miniature," we can also find that they have shared a narrow alley as a background. Naturally, the progressive filmmakers under capitalist exploitation do not have sufficient material resources, and the themes of the films allow some of their sets to be the same, which are one of the reasons why they did so. However, doing so completes the artistic purpose and obviously saves money, can't this also be used for our reference?

	We have many conditions to be proud of. The conditions set by the Party and the people for theater and film workers make many foreign friends who come to visit our country envious, but we cannot therefore breed the idea that we can spend money lavishly. On the contrary, as a true artist, one must also learn to manage the household and learn to manage money. It's not just about being meticulous and counting every penny; simply trying to save money is not the only goal, but also to learn to master the ability to embody more beautiful and better artistic effects from it. This is not only necessary, but also completely possible.

    艺术家和钱
    齐东野
    过去，艺术家耻于言钱，以为散漫小事，斤斤较量则有损清高；因而晋王夷甫“阿堵物”之说，得以艳称后世。似乎这种流风至今仍在起作用，而且显然与我们这个时代的勤俭建国之风，大相抵触。
    报载许多艺术团体在检查浪费，不少事例触目惊心：一出戏的演出费动辄数千甚至累万；演员的首饰得用真的，道具的被里得用绸的。电影的情况就更严重，一堂布景花上数千元只见一两个镜头，一部片子中女主角要换十几二十身服装，或者索性把钱交给演员“看着买去吧”。戏曲团体追求豪华布景之风在上海也开始抬头，观众眼花缭乱，演员用武无地……。似乎戏剧、影片的好坏端赖花钱多少而决定。而且这种脱离生活实际、散漫花钱的挥霍之风，直至整改以前，很少引起各该单位领导人的注意。而且，隐约之间，似乎那种口不言钱的“清高”之风又在作祟，要不得的很！
    钱能不能不花或少花？能！少花了钱能不能就降低了艺术的感染力？不能！问题在于肯不肯动脑筋，肯不肯把利用很少的物力达到很好的效果这件事，也当做艺术创造的内容之一来考虑。举两个可借鉴的例子：
    看过苏联芭蕾舞剧“唐·吉诃德”的同志当会惊叹于布景的丰富多彩，然而，许多造成立体印象的景物是画笔抹出来的（西班牙酒店的那个角楼便是突出例子）；许多远看晶莹夺目的首饰，近看都是很不值钱的东西。自然，舞剧、话剧和歌剧在演出风格上可能有差别，但，那巧思，那力求凭借艺术创造而不是凭金钱造成艺术效果的作风，却是应该适应于任何一种舞台演出的。
    我们在看日本影片“狼”和“缩影”时，也可以发现它们共用过一条狭窄的小巷作背景。自然，处于资本主义剥削下的进步电影工作者没有充足的物力、以及影片所表现的题材容许它们的某些布景相同，都是他们之所以如此做的原因之一，然而，这样做，完成了艺术目的，而且显然省了钱，不是也可以为我们的借鉴么？
    我们有许多值得骄傲的条件，党和人民为戏剧、电影工作者所设下的条件，使许许多多来我国参观的外国朋友艳羡不置，然而却不能因此滋生可以散漫花钱的念头，相反地，做为一个真正的艺术家也得学会持家，学会管钱。不光是精打细算锱铢必较而已，光图省钱不是唯一目的，而且要学会从这当中掌握体现更美、更好的艺术效果的本领。这不仅是必要的，而且是完全可能的。
