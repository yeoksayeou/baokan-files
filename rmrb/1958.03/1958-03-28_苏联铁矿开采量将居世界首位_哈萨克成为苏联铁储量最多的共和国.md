Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 27th: According to Soviet newspapers, the Soviet Union's iron ore mining volume is expected to rank first in the world within the next few years. In 1958 and 1959, the Soviet Union's iron ore production capacity will increase by approximately 35 million tons. This figure is equivalent to more than twice the total iron ore mining volume of Sweden and the United Kingdom in 1955.

Currently, the Soviet Union's iron ore mining volume is second only to the United States. Last year, the Soviet Union mined 84 million tons of iron ore, only 14 million tons less than the United States. The Soviet Union's iron ore output has been increasing year by year, increasing by 38.4 million tons from 1950 to 1956, while the United States decreased by more than 1.7 million tons during the same period. According to the Five-Year Plan targets, the Soviet Union's iron ore output will reach 160 million tons in 1960, at which time the Soviet Union will leave the United States behind and rank first in the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 27th: According to Soviet newspapers, recent geological explorations have shown that the Republic of Kazakhstan ranks first in the Soviet Union in terms of iron ore reserves. The iron ore reserves of Ukraine and the Urals, important steel industrial bases of the Soviet Union, have fallen behind Kazakhstan.

The Republic of Kazakhstan only began mining iron ore five years ago, and its current mining industry has a very large basic construction scale. By 1965, the Republic's total iron ore output will be more than half of Sweden's 1955 iron ore output, a country famous for its iron ore production in Europe.

They are very concerned about our country's socialist construction and expressed that after mastering Chinese, they want to come to China to help us with socialist construction.

    苏联铁矿开采量将居世界首位
    哈萨克成为苏联铁储量最多的共和国
    据新华社莫斯科27日电　据苏联报刊报道，苏联铁矿开采量在最近几年内就可以跃居世界第一位。在1958年和1959年，苏联铁矿的生产能力将增加约三千五百万吨。这个数字相当于1955年瑞典和英国铁矿开采量总和的两倍以上。
    目前，苏联的铁矿开采量仅次于美国。去年，苏联开采了八千四百万吨铁矿砂，只比美国少一千四百万吨。苏联铁矿砂产量年年增长，从1950年到1956年就增加了三千八百四十万吨，而美国在同一时期反而减少了一百七十多万吨。根据五年计划的指标，1960年苏联铁矿砂产量将达到一亿六千万吨，到那时，苏联就会把美国扔在后面而跃居世界第一位。
    据新华社莫斯科27日电　据苏联报纸报道：最近时期地质勘探的结果表明，哈萨克共和国在铁矿储量方面占居苏联第一位。苏联重要的钢铁工业基地——乌克兰和乌拉尔的铁矿储量已经落在哈萨克的后面。
    哈萨克共和国在五年前才开始开采铁矿，目前它的采矿工业基本建设规模很大。到1965年，共和国的铁矿砂总产量将比欧洲有名的铁矿出产国——瑞典1955年的铁矿砂产量多一半。
