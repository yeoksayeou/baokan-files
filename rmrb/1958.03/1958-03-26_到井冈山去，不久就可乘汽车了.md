    To Jinggangshan, Soon You Can Go by Car
    (Our report) Jiangxi Province began construction on the Jinggangshan Highway on March 1st.
    The Jinggangshan Highway starts from Shangtian in Taihe County, passing through Zaohe, Qiaotou, Bixi, Nashan, and Ciping, and enters the Jinggang Mountain area, with a total length of more than one hundred and ten kilometers. Many of the places it passes through are precipitous cliffs, and many places originally had only winding and tortuous narrow paths. The highway is rich in products along the line, such as grain, timber, bamboo, coal, iron, tungsten, copper, etc., which could not be transported out in the past due to inconvenient transportation. The completion of the highway will bring new prosperity to the revolutionary sacred place – the Jinggang Mountain area. People who visit Jinggangshan can also take a car.
    The local people are very excited about the construction of the Jinggangshan Highway. Cai Wenming, a veteran of the Red Army, said: "We never dreamed that Jinggang Mountain would be accessible by car for generations, and now we have waited for it." The residents along the line are willing to contribute their strength to the construction of this highway. They put forward a resounding slogan to complete and open to traffic this highway, which was planned to be completed in two years, within 1958. (Fu Yongqing) (Attached picture)

    到井冈山去，不久就可乘汽车了
    本报讯　江西省在3月1日动工兴建井冈山公路。
    井冈山公路自泰和县上田起，经早禾、桥头、碧溪、拿山、茨坪而进入井冈山区，全长一百一十公里多。所经过的地方，不少是悬岩陡壁，许多地方原来只有迂回曲折的羊肠小道。公路沿线物产丰富，如粮食、木材、毛竹、煤、铁、钨、铜等，过去皆因交通不便运不出去。公路建成，将给革命圣地——井冈山区，带来新的繁荣。上井冈山参观的人，也就可以坐上汽车了。
    修建井冈山公路，当地群众都很兴奋，红军老战士蔡文明说：“世世代代没有梦到井冈山上能通汽车，这下盼到了。”沿线居民，都愿为修建这条公路贡献自己的力量，他们提出了响亮的口号，要把这条计划二年修通的公路，提前在1958年内建成通车。　（傅庸清）（附图片）
