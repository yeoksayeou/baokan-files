Xinhua News Agency, Ruijin, March 24th. The observation and study meeting on the work of the Communist Youth League (CYL) in one hundred counties, jointly convened by the CYL provincial committees of Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong, concluded in Ruijin on the 23rd. The meeting decided to launch a socialist friendship competition among the one hundred counties.

The meeting began on the 15th. Participants included the secretaries of the CYL provincial committees from the four provinces, the secretaries of the CYL county committees from the one hundred counties, and some grassroots CYL cadres. Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the CYL Central Committee, also attended the meeting. More than eighty CYL cadres spoke at the meeting, introducing the role played and achievements made by CYL organizations and members in their respective regions in areas such as water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and literacy campaigns.

The communiqué issued by the meeting stated that the CYL workers participating in the observation and study meeting, after discussing the current situation of socialist construction in our country and studying the Party's principles and policies for further accelerating socialist construction, believe that they must continuously arm themselves with Mao Zedong's thought and strive to overcome conservative thinking. Only in this way can they stand at the forefront of the movement, further organize the enthusiasm and creativity of young people, and contribute to the great socialist cause.

The communiqué pointed out that in the great leap forward of socialism, the achievements of the CYL's work are the main aspect, but it is still not enough. Some things could have been done but were not done; some things could have been done faster but were not done faster; some things could have been done better but were not done better; some things could have been done more thoroughly but were not done more thoroughly. The reason is that CYL cadres still have some unnecessary concerns to varying degrees. These concerns often put CYL cadres in a contradiction of wanting to do but daring not to do, and therefore, breaking these unhealthy concerns is the core issue for doing a good job in future work.

The communiqué then elaborated on the various concerns existing among CYL workers. First, whenever they want to do something, they sometimes worry that the masses will not be mobilized; when the masses act resolutely, they are sometimes shaken by some backward opinions and dare not move forward resolutely. Therefore, they must strive to study Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction that the contradiction between the advanced and the backward is eternal. At any time, they must represent advanced thinking, carefully distinguish between advanced thinking and backward opinions among the masses, firmly believe in the majority of the masses, and resolutely rely on the advanced sections of the masses to lead the masses to move forward continuously. The second concern is that whenever they want to do something, they worry that there are no instructions from above and lack a basis. Therefore, they must strive to study Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction that all work must proceed from reality. Any policy instruction is a synthesis and refinement of advanced experiences among the masses. It is wrong not to carry out one's own work according to instructions. However, actual life is vivid and ever-changing. This requires revolutionary cadres to be good at creatively carrying out work based on the instructions of their superiors and using new experiences to enrich the instructions of their superiors. Both discipline and creativity are precisely the true revolutionary spirit that the Party requires revolutionary cadres to possess. The third concern is that they worry that they have no experience and are afraid of not doing well. Therefore, they must strive to study Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction that only by doing can one increase one's ability. If things are done successfully, there will be successful experiences; if things are done wrong, there will also be experience in doing things right again. Only by working hard and bravely practicing can relatively young cadres increase their abilities relatively quickly, learn vivid Marxism-Leninism, and gradually become good cadres of the Party. The fourth concern is that they worry that doing too much CYL work will hinder the Party's central work, and therefore they often passively wait for the unified deployment of the Party committee and dare not boldly lead the broad masses of young people to carry out more activities. Therefore, they must deeply understand Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction on "more, faster, better, and more economical." In the period of the comprehensive great leap forward of socialist construction, the Party committee's central work is not one thing, but many. The CYL should not only, but also can, take the initiative to select several things from the Party's unified plan that young people are particularly capable of doing, concentrate the strength of young people, and do these things well in a planned, measured, appealing, and checked manner. In this way, it meets the overall needs of the Party and enriches the activities of the CYL.

The communiqué believes that this meeting examined the shortcomings in the work of the CYL, further liberating the spirit of the CYL workers and making their revolutionary courage even greater.

The communiqué put forward eight tasks as items for carrying out the friendship competition: First, mobilize young people to actively promote and participate in agricultural capital construction such as leveling land and transforming low-yield fields in plain areas, building small reservoirs, hydroelectric stations, and hydropower stations, and repairing roads in mountainous areas; second, carry out technical reform experiments centered on high-yield production; third, afforest and green mountains, develop mountainous areas, and become green counties in three years; fourth, achieve literacy in all counties within three years; fifth, carry out work-study programs; sixth, achieve "four-without" counties within three years; seventh, promote Putonghua; and eighth, strive to improve the work of the Young Pioneers.

Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the CYL Central Committee, delivered an important speech at the meeting.

### 克服保守思想，解决想干又不敢干的矛盾  共青团要站在运动最前线  江西、湖南、福建、广东四省共青团观摩会发表公报

    克服保守思想，解决想干又不敢干的矛盾
    共青团要站在运动最前线
    江西、湖南、福建、广东四省共青团观摩会发表公报
    新华社瑞金24日电　由共青团江西、湖南、福建、广东四省省委联合召开的一百个县共青团工作的观摩学习会，23日在瑞金闭幕。这次会议决定在一百个县之间开展社会主义友谊竞赛。
    这次会议是15日开始举行的。参加会议的有四个省的团省委书记、一百个县的团县委书记和部分团的基层干部。团中央第一书记胡耀邦也参加了会议。有八十多个共青团干部在会上发言，介绍了所在地区共青团组织和团员们在兴修水利、积肥、扫盲方面发挥的作用和做出的成绩。
    会议发表的公报说，参加观摩学习会的共青团工作者，讨论了我国当前社会主义建设的形势，学习了党进一步加速社会主义建设的方针政策后，认为必须不断地以毛主席的思想武装自己，努力克服保守思想，只有这样，才能站在运动的前面，把青年的积极性和创造性进一步组织起来，为伟大的社会主义事业贡献力量。
    公报指出，在社会主义大跃进中，共青团的工作成绩是主要的，但还做得不够。有些事情可以做而没有做；有些事可以做得更快些而没有做得更快；有些事可以做得更好些而没有做得更好；有些事可以做得更彻底些而没有做得更彻底。原因是，团的干部在不同程度上还存在着一些不必要的顾虑，这些顾虑常常使团的干部处在想干又不敢干的矛盾之中，因而破除这些不健康的顾虑是做好今后工作的核心问题。
    公报接着阐述了在共青团工作者中存在的各种顾虑。第一，每当想干件事的时候，有时耽心群众发动不起来；在群众坚决行动起来的时候，有时又为某些落后意见所动摇而不敢坚决前进。为此，必须努力学习毛主席关于先进和落后的矛盾是永远存在的这个光辉指示。任何时候都要代表先进思想，都要仔细区别群众中的先进思想和落后意见，坚信群众的大多数，坚决依靠群众中的先进部分，去带动群众不断前进。第二种顾虑是，每当想干一件事的时候，耽心上级没有指示，缺乏根据。为此，必须努力学习毛主席关于一切工作必须从实际出发的这个光辉指示。任何政策性的指示，都是群众中的先进经验的综合和提炼，不根据指示去进行自己的工作是错误的。但是，实际生活是生动的、千变万化的。这就要求革命干部善于根据上级的指示创造性地进行工作，用新的经验去丰富上级的指示。既有纪律性，又有创造性，正是党要求革命干部具备的真正的革命干劲。第三种顾虑是，耽心没有经验，怕做不好。为此，必须努力学习毛主席的只有干才能增长才能这个光辉指示。把事情办成功了，就会有成功的经验，把事情办错了，也会取得把事情重新办好的经验。比较年轻的干部只有努力勇敢地实践，才能比较快地增长自己的才能，才能学到生动的马克思列宁主义，才能逐渐地成为党的好干部。第四种顾虑是，耽心团的工作作多了会不会妨碍党的中心工作，因而往往消极等待党委的统一部署，而不敢大胆地带领广大青年开展更多的活动。为此，必须深刻地领会毛主席关于多、快、好、省的这一英明指示，在社会主义建设全面大跃进的时期，党委常年的中心工作不是一个，而是很多。共青团不仅应当，也完全可能主动地从党的统一规划中，选择几件青年人特别能够出力的事情，集中青年的力量，有计划、有措施、有号召、有检查地把这些事情干好。这样，既符合党的整个需要，也丰富了团的活动。
    公报认为，这次会议检查了团的工作中的缺点，使共青团工作者的精神得到了进一步的解放，革命勇气更足了。
    公报提出了八项工作，作为开展友谊竞赛的项目：一是发动青年积极推动和参加平原地区平整土地、改造低产田，山区兴修小型水库、水力站、水电站和修整道路等农业基本建设；二是开展以高额丰产为中心的技术改革试验活动；三是造林绿化，开发山区，三年成为绿化县；四是三年内实现无文盲县；五是开展勤工俭学活动；六是三年内实现四无县；七是推广普通话；八是努力改进少先队工作。
    共青团中央第一书记胡耀邦在会上作了重要讲话。
