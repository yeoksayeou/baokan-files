    A Big-Character Poster Solved the Problem
    Yang Mingliang, a second-year student in the Geophysics Department of the Beijing Institute of Geology and Exploration, suggested in his big-character poster that there are many ways to implement the "Three Diligences" method: One could go to the transformer factory to participate in labor, which can accommodate more than a hundred people; go to the bacterial fertilizer factory to package pesticides, which can accommodate more than fifty people; and also go to the geophysical prospecting team to participate in labor. The advantages of participating in labor are: cultivating intellectuals who are both "red and expert," which is a good opportunity to transform one's thinking. If one can work for half a year, not only can it save 96,000 yuan in expenses, but it can also create wealth for the country.
    After studying this big-character poster, the school leaders immediately contacted the transformer factory and the bacterial fertilizer factory and posted a big-character poster in response on the same day. The second-year students of the Geophysics Department were extremely happy. They then posted good news, expressing that they would definitely be outstanding workers.

    一张大字报  问题解决了
    北京地质勘探学院物探系二年级学生杨明亮的大字报上提出，贯彻三勤的方法门路很多：可到变压器厂参加劳动，能容纳一百多人；到细菌肥料厂去包装农药，可容纳五十多人；还可到物探队去参加劳动。参加劳动的优点是：培养又红又专的知识分子，这是一个改造思想的好机会。若能劳动半年，不但可节省开支九万六千元，并且还可为国家创造财富。
    学校领导上研究了这张大字报以后，马上与变压器厂、细菌肥料厂联系好，当天就贴出大字报作了答复。物探系二年级的学生们高兴极了。他们随即贴出喜报，表示一定做一个出色的工人。
