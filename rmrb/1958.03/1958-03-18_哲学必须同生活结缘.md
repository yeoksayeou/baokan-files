The serious problem existing in philosophical research work is still emphasizing the past and belittling the present. What is most intolerable is that the study of the Party's line, policies, and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong is still insufficient. As everyone knows, Marxist dialectics is undergoing a new stage of development worldwide with the rise of the communist movement. In our country, this development is obviously very significant. Taking Chairman Mao's works as an example, from "On Contradiction" to the publication of "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," one can clearly see the leap in the development of Marxist dialectics in China. However, some people today verbally acknowledge and praise it, but are unwilling to earnestly and conscientiously study it. Moreover, the trend of valuing the past and neglecting the present, and using the past as an example for the present, has been quite popular in recent years.

Today, if China's philosophical circles are to leap forward, they must change this trend and custom. First of all, we must earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, and earnestly study the Party's line, principles, and policies. If we do not firmly establish this foothold and do not start from this foundation, it will be difficult to leap forward.

The separation of philosophical workers from the masses and from reality is one of the major obstacles to our leap forward. This point is related to the phenomena mentioned above. Marxist philosophy is the philosophy of the proletariat, and also the philosophy of the people. It is drawn from the practice of the people's revolution and construction. Therefore, whoever separates himself from the masses and from the reality of life will never be able to learn or understand Marxist philosophy. However, many of our comrades and friends do not firmly believe in this point or adopt an attitude of indifference and negation. It should be said that this is the fatal wound that prevents us from leaping forward. Here, we might as well analyze, what kind of person can be considered a philosopher? Is it that anyone who has read a few books on philosophy or written a few philosophical papers can be considered a philosopher? I'm afraid not. We believe that the greatest philosophers in China today should first be Chairman Mao and some responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee. Our Party Central Committee is a great collective of politicians, a collective of economists, and also a great collective of philosophers. Our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are all closely connected with reality and with the masses. Therefore, if we want to leap forward, we must put down the airs of "philosophers," learn from the masses, connect with life, and humbly learn from comrades engaged in practical work.

To leap forward, I think we must also appropriately lift the lid in the philosophical circles. In the past few years, some well-known philosophers have spread many revisionist and non-Marxist ideas, which have had a considerable poisoning effect. Therefore, if we want to leap forward in philosophy, we must also vigorously oppose revisionism and wage an uncompromising struggle against all anti-Marxist philosophical ideas.

Finally, in our leap forward, we must also adhere to the spirit emphasized in the Moscow Declaration: to apply dialectical materialism in practical work, and to educate cadres and the broad masses with Marxism-Leninism. Philosophical workers must strive to direct their activities towards this overall goal, use the method of integrating theory with practice, help cadres and educate young people to correctly understand the theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism, correctly understand the Marxist-Leninist world outlook, correctly apply dialectical materialism in practical work, and make philosophical work truly serve the cause of socialist construction.

    哲学必须同生活结缘
    孙定国
    在哲学研究工作中存在着的严重问题也还是厚古薄今。令人最不能容忍的是对党的路线、政策和毛泽东同志的著作研究得还很不够。谁都知道，马克思主义辩证法随着共产主义运动的上升正在全世界范围内经历着新的发展阶段。在我国，这个发展显然是十分巨大的。就以毛主席的著作来说，从“矛盾论”到“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的发表，就可以清楚地看到，马克思主义辩证法在中国的飞跃发展。可是，现在有些人口头上承认它，赞扬它，而不肯切实认真地去研究它。并且，详古略今、以古例今的风气近年颇为流行。
    今天中国的哲学界要跃进，就必须移此风、易此俗。首先，必须认真地研究毛主席的著作，认真地研究党的路线、方针和政策。如果不把这个立脚点站牢，不从这个基点出发，那就很难跃进。
    哲学工作者的脱离群众、脱离实际，是障碍我们跃进的重大阻力之一。这一点是同上面所说的那些现象相联系的。马克思主义哲学是无产阶级的哲学，同时也就是人民群众的哲学。它是从人民的革命和建设的实践中抽引出来的。因此，谁要是脱离了群众、脱离了生活实际，那他就一辈子也没法学好或者懂得马克思主义哲学。可是我们有不少同志和朋友对于这一点信之不笃或者采取了漠视和否定的态度。应该说，这是我们不能跃进的致命伤。在这里不妨分析一下，到底什么人才算得起是哲学家？是不是光读了几本哲学书或者写了几篇哲学论文的就算是哲学家呢？恐怕不是。我们认为中国当前最伟大的哲学家首先应该是毛主席以及党中央的一些负责同志。我们党的中央委员会是一个伟大的政治家集体，经济学家集体，同时也是一个伟大的哲学家集体。我们的党中央和毛主席都是密切联系实际、联系群众的。因此，我们要跃进就必须放下“哲学家”的架子，向群众学习，同生活结缘，虚心地向从事实际工作的同志学习。
    要跃进，我认为还必须在哲学界适当地揭揭盖子。过去几年，有些颇有名气的哲学家，曾经散布了不少修正主义的、非马克思主义的思想，这些思想起了相当大的毒害作用。因此，我们要在哲学上跃进，还必须大力反修正主义，同一切反马克思主义的哲学思想做不妥协的斗争。
    最后，我们在跃进中还必须坚持莫斯科宣言强调的精神：在实际工作中运用辩证唯物论，用马克思列宁主义教育干部和广大群众。哲学工作者必须努力把自己的活动指向这个总的目标上，运用理论联系实际的方法，帮助干部和教育青年正确认识马克思列宁主义的理论基础，正确地认识马克思列宁主义的世界观，正确地在实际工作中运用辩证唯物论，使哲学工作切实地为社会主义建设事业服务。
