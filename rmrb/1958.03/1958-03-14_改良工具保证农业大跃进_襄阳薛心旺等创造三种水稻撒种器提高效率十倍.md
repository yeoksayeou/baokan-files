    Improved Tools Guarantee Agricultural Great Leap Forward
    Xiangyang's Xue Xinwang and Others Create Three Types of Rice Seeders, Increasing Efficiency Tenfold
    (Our Report) To guarantee the agricultural Great Leap Forward and realize the "thousand, hundred, ten thousand, double the yield" plan, Xue Xinwang, the director of Baima Agricultural Cooperative in Wolong Township, Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, was thinking of every possible way to solve the cooperative's labor shortage. This year, the cooperative has to plant rice seedlings on 180 mu of land, including both old and new fields. If they were to sow the sprouted seeds by grabbing handfuls and scattering them from their fingers, as they had done in the past, one person could at most work on 0.9 mu of land per day, requiring a total of 200 workers to complete the task. In order to accelerate the sowing process, he spent more than ten nights without proper sleep, working with carpenters to create a simple and easy-to-use hand-cranked seeder. Using this seeder, one person can do the work of four or five, and the seeds are scattered very evenly. Later, they designed a "rice automatic seeder" operated by three people, which can do the work of thirty. In late February, based on this machine, he improved and successfully trial-produced a "personal seeder" that can sow an entire pond of seeds at once, capable of sowing eight mu of land per day. With these three types of seeding tools, the large fields can use the large machines, and the small fields and corners can use the small ones. The fields that originally required 200 workers to sow can now be completed with just over twenty, increasing efficiency by nearly ten times.
    (Our Report from Kunming, March 13th) Yuan Xueli, production team leader, and Li Huarong, accountant, of Xiaozhai Township, Jinning County, Yunnan Province, have successfully trial-produced a capstan plowing device. The capstan plowing device trial-produced in Xiaozhai Township is not too complicated in structure and operation. It only requires a few wooden stakes to form a square wooden frame, with a larger round shaft installed in the middle, and an iron or leather rope attached to the shaft. A horizontal wooden bar is then attached to the upper end of the wooden shaft, and the other end of the iron rope is hung in front of the plow. When in use, one person holds the plow handle, and the other person pushes the wooden bar around the wooden frame to rotate, and the iron rope winds around the wooden shaft. Due to the pulling force of the iron rope, the walking plow naturally digs into the soil eight or nine inches deep, turning over the soil piece by piece. Using this type of plowing device to plow terrace fields is very efficient. In the past, digging terrace fields manually required eight strong laborers to dig only one mu per day; using animal power to plow required two water buffalo and two strong laborers to plow only 0.8 mu per day. Now, without the need for livestock, only two ordinary laborers are needed to plow 1.5 to 2 mu per day. If further improvements are made, with a capstan and plow placed at each end of a field, and two people cranking while one person guides the plow back and forth, the efficiency will be even higher.

    改良工具保证农业大跃进
    襄阳薛心旺等创造三种水稻撒种器提高效率十倍
    本报讯  湖北襄阳县卧龙乡白马农业社主任薛心旺为了保证农业大跃进，实现“千、百、万，翻一番”的规划，就想一切办法解决社里劳力不足的困难。这个社今年连新老田一起，要下一百八十亩田的秧，如果像以往一把把抓芽谷从手指缝里往田里撒，一人一天顶多搞得九分田，共要二百个人工才能全部搞完。为了能加速下秧，他有上十个晚上没好好睡觉，和木工们一起做出了一个构造简单，使用方便的手摇撒谷器。用这个撒谷器一人能抵四、五个人用，撒的谷子很匀。后来他们又设计出了三个人掌握，能抵三十个人撒种的“水稻自动撒种机”。2月下旬，他又在这架机子的基础上，改进和试制成功了一个人一次能撒满一池子的“个人撒谷机”，一天可以撒八亩地的谷。有了这三种撒种工具，大块田可用大型的，小块田和田角用小型的，这个社原来要用二百个工才能撒完的田，现在只要二十几个就行了，提高效率近十倍。
    本报昆明13日电  云南晋宁县小寨乡生产队长袁学礼和会计李华荣，试制绞车犁田器成功。小寨乡试制的绞车犁田器，结构和操作并不太复杂，只要用几根木椿做成四方型木架，中间安上较大的圆轴，轴上装上铁索或皮索，再在木轴的上端装上一根横木杆，铁索的另一端挂在犁张的前边。使用时一个人扶着犁把，另一个人就推着木杆绕木架旋转，铁索也就随着绕到木轴上边。由于铁索的拖力，步犁就自然的钻进八、九寸深的土里，把土一块块的翻起。使用这种犁田器犁板田效率很高。过去用人力挖板田，八个强劳动力一天只能挖一亩；用畜力犁田，两头水牛和两个强劳动力，一天只能犁八分。现在，不需用牲畜，只要用两个平常的劳动力，一天就能犁一亩半到两亩。如果再改进一下，在一块田的两头各放一张绞车和犁张，两个人绞一个人来回扶犁，效率将会更高。
