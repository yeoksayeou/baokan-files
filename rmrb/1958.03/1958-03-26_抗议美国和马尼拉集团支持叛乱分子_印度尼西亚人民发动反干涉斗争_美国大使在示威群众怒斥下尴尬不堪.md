Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: A mass movement opposing interference in Indonesian internal affairs by the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is unfolding vigorously in Indonesia.

Under the leadership of the "Indonesian University Students' Mass Action Committee Against the 'Revolutionary Government'," several hundred representatives of Jakarta University students held a demonstration in front of the US Embassy on the morning of the 25th, holding up placards protesting US and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization interference in Indonesian affairs.

Using loudspeakers, the demonstrators read a statement to the US Ambassador to Indonesia, Jones, condemning US Secretary of State Dulles for making remarks interfering in Indonesian internal affairs, condemning foreign powers for supplying weapons to Indonesian rebels, and expressing opposition to any interference in Indonesian internal affairs by foreign countries and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

The statement concluded by demanding that the United States guarantee that US weapons would not fall into the hands of Indonesian rebel groups and demanded the abolition of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

When representatives of the demonstrating students handed the statement to Jones, an argument ensued. Jones argued that the United States had no intention of interfering in Indonesian internal affairs. He also said that he could not be held responsible for US weapons falling into the hands of the rebels. Jones also stated that he could not guarantee that no US weapons would be delivered to the rebels in the future.

The demonstrating students expressed indignation at the US Ambassador's response. They said that this was the true face of the United States.

Prior to this, some Indonesian youths demonstrated in front of the residence of US Ambassador to Indonesia Jones on the afternoon of the 24th, protesting US interference in Indonesia.

These demonstrating youths angrily condemned the United States for openly and covertly assisting Indonesian rebels, thereby interfering in Indonesia. They also expressed their firm opposition to the US request to send troops to Pekanbaru in Central Sumatra.

When a representative of the demonstrators told US Ambassador to Indonesia Jones that Indonesian youths demanded the dissolution of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the participating youths shouted in unison: "Dissolve the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization!" "No Southeast Asia Treaty Organization interference in Indonesia!"

When Jones replied that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization was not a war organization but a so-called "defensive organization," the youths immediately shouted: "That's a lie!" "A lie!"

The representatives of the demonstrators finally asked Jones to forward their demands to the US government. The US Ambassador retreated into his residence, pale-faced.

The Indonesian Peasants' Front also sent representatives on the morning of the 24th to deliver a statement to the US Embassy in Indonesia, demanding the dissolution of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and demanding that the organization stop interfering in the internal affairs of Indonesia and other Asian countries.

On the morning of the 23rd, prominent slogans appeared on the walls of the US Embassy in Jakarta and the US Ambassador's residence, reading, "The People Oppose Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Interference in Indonesia" and "Dissolve the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

At the same time, the Jakarta branch of the Minangkabau Ethnic Association of Central Sumatra, which was established on the evening of the 23rd, also issued a statement at its founding anniversary, protesting against the United States' open interference in Indonesian internal affairs and supporting the government's resolute measures against the rebel groups. The Minangkabau ethnic group is one of the main ethnic groups in Central Sumatra.

The Jakarta "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 24th, pointing out that the movement of the Indonesian people against the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has begun. The people have clearly realized that the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are the enemies of Indonesia. "People's Daily" said that the United States should understand that the Indonesian people will carry this movement through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 25th: Three hundred representatives of Indonesian government employees and government workers' cooperative organizations delivered a statement from the organization to President Sukarno this morning, expressing support for the government's measures against the rebel groups.

    抗议美国和马尼拉集团支持叛乱分子
    印度尼西亚人民发动反干涉斗争
    美国大使在示威群众怒斥下尴尬不堪
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：反对美国和东南亚条约组织干涉印度尼西亚内政的群众运动，正在印度尼西亚轰轰烈烈地展开。
    在“印度尼西亚大学生反对‘革命政府’群众行动委员会”的领导下，雅加达大学生的几百名代表25日早上在美国大使馆前高举着标语牌举行示威，抗议美国和东南亚条约组织干预印度尼西亚事务。
    示威群众通过扩音器对美国驻印度尼西亚大使琼斯朗读一项声明，谴责美国国务卿杜勒斯发表干涉印度尼西亚内政的谈话，谴责外国供给印度尼西亚叛军武器的行动，并且表示反对外国和东南亚条约组织对印度尼西亚内政的任何干涉。
    声明最后要求美国保证不让美国武器落到印度尼西亚叛乱集团的手里，并且要求取消东南亚条约组织。
    当示威学生的代表把声明书交给琼斯的时候，争论展开了。琼斯辩解说，美国无意干预印度尼西亚内政，他又说，他不能对美国武器落入叛军手中一事负责。琼斯还表示不能保证将来没有美国武器运交给叛军。
    示威学生对于美国大使的这种答复表示愤慨。他们说，这就是美国的真面目。
    在这以前，一些印度尼西亚青年在24日下午到美国驻印度尼西亚大使琼斯的住宅门前举行示威，抗议美国干涉印度尼西亚。
    这些示威的青年愤怒地谴责美国公开地和隐蔽地帮助印度尼西亚的叛乱分子，从而干涉印度尼西亚。他们还表示坚决反对美国曾经提出的派遣军队到中苏门答腊北干巴鲁去的要求。
    当示威群众的一位代表向美国驻印度尼西亚大使琼斯表示印度尼西亚青年要求解散东南亚条约组织的时候，参加示威的青年齐声高呼：“解散东南亚条约组织！”“不许东南亚条约组织干涉印度尼西亚！”
    当琼斯回答说东南亚条约组织不是战争组织而是所谓“防御组织”的时候，青年们立刻高呼：“这是撒谎！”“撒谎！”
    示威群众的代表最后要求琼斯把他们的要求转交美国政府。这位美国大使脸色苍白地缩回他的住宅里面去。
    印度尼西亚农民阵线在24日上午也派代表把一份声明交给美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆，声明要求解散东南亚条约组织，并且要求这个组织停止干涉印度尼西亚和其他亚洲国家的内政。
    在23日早晨美国驻雅加达大使馆和美国大使住所的墙上都出现了显著的大字标语，标语上写道，“人民反对东南亚条约组织干涉印度尼西亚”、“解散东南亚条约组织”。
    同时，23日晚上成立的中苏门答腊的米囊卡堡族协会雅加达分会也在成立纪念会上发表声明，抗议美国公开干涉印度尼西亚内政，并且拥护政府对叛乱集团所采取的坚决措施。米囊卡堡族是中苏门答腊的主要民族之一。
    雅加达“人民日报”24日发表的社论指出，印度尼西亚人民反对东南亚条约组织的运动已经开展起来。人民已经清楚地认识到美国和东南亚条约组织是印度尼西亚的敌人。“人民日报”说，美国应当懂得，印度尼西亚人民要把这个运动进行到底。
    据新华社雅加达25日电印度尼西亚政府雇员和政府工人合作机构的代表三百人，今天早上将这个机构的一项声明交给苏加诺总统，表示支持政府对叛乱集团所采取的措施。
