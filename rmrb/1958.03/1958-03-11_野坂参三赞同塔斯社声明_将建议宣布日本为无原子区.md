    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 10th: According to a report in the "Akahata" newspaper, Nozaka Sanzō, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, expressed his agreement with the proposal in the TASS statement authorized on the 8th regarding the establishment of a collective security system and nuclear-free zones in Asia. He said that this proposal is in line with the spirit of the times.

    Nozaka Sanzō pointed out that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting will discuss the establishment of nuclear weapon and missile bases. He said that if the member countries of this organization—Thailand, Pakistan, and the Philippines—agree to establish such bases on their own territory, it would be tantamount to suicide. Nozaka Sanzō said that Japan, which has suffered from atomic bombings, should be the first to advocate the establishment of a nuclear-free zone. He is prepared to submit a proposal to the Japanese Diet to declare Japan a nuclear-free zone. Nozaka Sanzō pointed out that the Japanese Communist Party is prepared to work with the Japanese Socialist Party to organize a people's movement to strive for the establishment of an Asian collective security system.

    野坂参三赞同塔斯社声明
    将建议宣布日本为无原子区
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”报道，日本共产党中央委员会第一书记野坂参三表示同意塔斯社在8日受权发表的声明中关于在亚洲建立集体安全体系和无原子地区的建议。他说，这个建议是符合时代精神的。
    野坂参三指出，东南亚条约组织理事会会议将讨论建立核武器和导弹基地的问题。他说，这个组织的成员国——泰国、巴基斯坦和菲律宾如果同意在本国境内建立这样的基地，就等于自杀。野坂参三说，曾经遭受过原子轰炸苦难的日本应当首倡建立无原子地区。他准备把宣布日本为无原子地区的建议提交日本国会讨论。野坂参三指出，日本共产党准备同日本社会党一道去组织人民运动，为建立亚洲集体安全体系而努力。
