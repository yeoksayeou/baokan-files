Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 8th: The Prime Minister's Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a press conference this afternoon, publishing an open letter from Prime Minister Pham Van Dong to Ngo Dinh Diem. The full text is as follows:

Mr.: Since the victorious conclusion of our nation's heroic resistance war, all our compatriots from North to South have earnestly hoped that peace would be consolidated and the motherland would be unified at an early date. However, this legitimate aspiration has not yet been realized. The main reason is the policy of intervention adopted by American imperialism towards our South.

After the failure of American imperialism's conspiracy to delay and expand the Indochina War, and following the Geneva Conference, it immediately established the Southeast Asia Military Alliance, increasingly intensifying its intervention in various countries, including our South. From that time until now, American imperialism has continuously consolidated this alliance. Particularly recently, it has taken another step forward in connecting aggressive military blocs from Europe to Asia, and has promoted the establishment of rocket bases and activities in preparation for atomic warfare.

The interventionist policy of American imperialism threatens the independence and freedom of all nations. The crisis of atomic war is seriously threatening the peace and security of Southeast Asian countries and the world.

In order to involve our South in its war preparation conspiracy, American imperialism has shipped many military personnel and new war materials into the South; instigated the Southern regime to intensify conscription in order to strengthen its military forces; and expanded and built many airports, seaports, and a strategic highway network in the South. The vicious conspiracy of American imperialism is to turn the South into an aggressive military base of the United States in Southeast Asia.

American imperialism's policy of strengthening its army while conducting military monopoly and political control is the greatest crisis threatening peace and hindering the realization of national unification, creating tension in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. This policy is weakening the Southern economy day by day, leaving it with no way out, and making the lives of people of all strata in urban and rural areas increasingly difficult.

In my letter to the Southern authorities on July 18, 1957, I clearly pointed out that American imperialism's interference in military, political, and economic aspects is threatening peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, seriously infringing upon the independence, autonomy, and national dignity of the people of our South, and hindering our national unification cause.

At present, the forces of peace are stronger than ever before. Peace-loving people all over the world are strengthening their unity and struggling to oppose war and defend peace. All our people from North to South clearly see the danger of American imperialism's war policy and interventionist policy, and demand that all interference by American imperialism in the South be stopped, that American military personnel be withdrawn from the South, and that the expansion and construction of military bases be stopped in strict accordance with the terms and spirit of the Geneva Accords, and that the South not be dragged into any military bloc in any form.

Our people's desire for peaceful unification has received the sympathy and support of peace-loving and just people all over the world. The Cairo Conference, held not long ago, expressed the firm will of hundreds of millions of Asian and African people to unite and struggle for national independence, world peace, and against the interventionist and war policies of American imperialism.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is determined to fight for the peaceful unification aspirations of the entire nation. For more than three years, and from now on, it is always prepared to hold consultative conferences with the Southern authorities to discuss the issue of holding general elections throughout the country and unifying Vietnam in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has reduced its army by 80,000 troops and cut the 1957 defense budget.

In order to express our earnest desire for peace and national unification, to oppose the war policy adopted by American imperialism, and to ensure peace and reduce the burden on the people, we believe that in the current situation, mutual disarmament by both sides is of utmost importance.

In order to build a prosperous economy, realize national independence and autonomy, and improve the people's lives, we once again propose the necessity of restoring and developing normal relations between the two sides, starting with the restoration of economic relations.

Therefore, on behalf of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I suggest that the ruling authorities of both sides meet as soon as possible to jointly discuss ways to mutually reduce military forces and seek ways to promote trade.

The above-mentioned practical measures will create favorable conditions for promoting mutual approach, mutual understanding, and then consultation on free general elections and national unification.

We believe that these suggestions will be warmly welcomed by the people of the whole country and will receive the sympathy of patriots in the Southern regime and army.

We hope that, for the supreme interests of the motherland, for the legitimate aspirations of the people of all strata on both sides, and for the interests of world peace, the Southern authorities will make the necessary efforts to respond to our above suggestions and put forward constructive opinions.

I hope to receive an early reply from the Government of the Republic of Vietnam. I extend my sincere greetings to you.

            Pham Van Dong
                      Prime Minister of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
              March 7, 1958, in Hanoi

### 范文同总理函吴庭艳建议举行会谈  双方裁军　互通贸易

    范文同总理函吴庭艳建议举行会谈
    双方裁军　互通贸易
    新华社河内8日电　越南民主共和国总理府今天下午举行了记者招待会，公布了范文同总理给吴庭艳的一封公开信，全文如下：
    先生：自从我国全民的英勇抗战胜利结束以后，我们从北到南的全体同胞都殷切地希望和平得到巩固，祖国早日获得统一，但是直到现在，这个正当的愿望仍然没有实现。主要原因是美帝国主义对我国南方采取干涉的政策。
    美帝国主义在企图拖延和扩大印度支那战争的阴谋遭到失败和在日内瓦会议之后，紧接着就成立了东南亚军事联盟，日益加深对各国的干涉，其中包括我国的南方。从那时候起直到现在，美帝国主义不断地巩固这个联盟，特别是最近，它们在连接从欧洲到亚洲的侵略性的军事集团的活动中又前进了一步，并促成建立火箭基地、进行准备原子战争的活动。
    美帝国主义的干涉政策威胁着各民族的独立和自由。原子战争的危机正在严重威胁着东南亚各国和世界的和平和安全。
    美帝国主义为了把我国南方卷入它们准备战争的阴谋中去，曾经运进南方很多军事人员和新的战争物资；唆使南方政权加紧抓丁，以便加强军事力量；在南方扩大和建立许多机场、海港并建立起战略公路网。美帝国主义的毒辣阴谋是企图把南方变成美国在东南亚的侵略性的军事基地。
    美帝国主义企图加强军队同时进行军事垄断和政治控制的政策，是威胁和平和阻碍实现国家统一、在越南和东南亚制造紧张局势的最大危机，这个政策使南方的经济日益削弱，毫无出路，使城乡各阶层人民的生活日益困难。
    我在1957年7月18日寄给南方当局的函件中曾明确地指出，美帝国主义在军事、政治、经济各方面的干涉，正在威胁着越南和东南亚的和平，严重地侵犯了我国南方人民的独立自主和民族尊严，阻碍了我国的统一事业。
    目前和平力量比任何时候都更加强大，世界上爱好和平的人民正在加强团结，为反对战争保卫和平而斗争。我国从北到南的全体人民都清楚地看到美帝国主义的战争政策和干涉政策的危险，要求制止美帝国主义对南方的一切干涉，要求美国军事人员撤出南方，要求正确地按照日内瓦协议的条款和精神停止扩大和建立军事基地，不得以任何形式把南方拉入任何军事集团。
    我国人民和平统一的愿望得到世界上爱好和平和公理的人民的同情和支持。不久以前举行的开罗会议表达了成亿的亚非人民团结和为民族独立、世界和平、反对美帝国主义干涉政策和战争政策而斗争的坚决意志。
    越南民主共和国政府坚决为全国人民的和平统一愿望而奋斗。三年多以来，以至今后，始终准备同南方当局召开协商会议，根据日内瓦协议的规定讨论在全国范围内举行普选和统一越南的问题。
    越南民主共和国政府曾经裁减了八万军队和削减了1957年的国防预算。
    为了表示和平和统一国家的殷切愿望，反对美帝国主义采取的战争政策，为了保证和平和减轻人民的负担，我们认为在目前的情况下，双方共同裁减军队有着极其重要的意义。
    为了建设繁荣的经济，实现国家的独立自主，为了改善人民的生活，我们再一次提出恢复和发展双方的正常关系，首先是恢复双方的经济关系的必要性。
    因此我代表越南民主共和国政府，建议双方执政当局早日会面，以便共同讨论双方裁减军队和寻求互通贸易的办法。
    上述切实的办法将为促进双方互相接近、互相了解、进而协商自由普选和统一国家创造有利的条件。
    我们相信，这些建议将会得到全国人民的热烈响应以及南方政权和军队中的爱国者的同情。
    我们希望：为了祖国最高的利益，为了双方各阶层人民的正当愿望，为了世界和平的利益，南方当局对我们的上述建议会作出必要的努力，并提出建设性的意见。
    我希望能得到越南共和国政府的早日答复。谨向您郑重致意。
        越南民主共和国政府
                      总理范文同
              1958年3月7日于河内
