Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: To promote a great leap forward in literary work, the China Writers Association issued a resounding call to writers across the country in a letter entitled "Writers! Leap Forward, Great Leap Forward!" on the 7th. The full text of the letter is as follows:

The high tide of the socialist Great Leap Forward of 600 million people has arrived. Everyone is excited, everyone is taking the lead, and miracles are appearing anytime, anywhere. The miracles of a single day are enough to write many epics, dramas, and novels. Writers, theorists, and translators, how can we not be happy and ecstatic, wanting to transform into beings with three heads and six arms, seeing in all directions, hearing from all sides, working on multiple fronts simultaneously, whipping the horses, and reporting and praising in a timely manner, encouraging even greater enthusiasm, so that every day, every hour, every minute that our predecessors dared not dream of can be realized before our very eyes!

Last year, hundreds of writers across the country formulated creative plans. In today's situation, we require these writers to:

	(1) Resolutely implement the plan and fulfill it ahead of schedule.

	(2) Revise and supplement the original plan, changing "doing what one can" and "taking one's time" into "going all out" and "immediately rushing forward," so that our plan becomes the "vanguard" plan of the writers' ranks. Each plan must be supplemented with several short and concise works that reflect and encourage the current Great Leap Forward. The original plan for long works must be followed, both quickly and well, ensuring quality. At the same time, some short works must also be written for publication at any time. We wield long spears, but we also need short sticks. Whether long or short, everything must be creative.

	(3) When revising and supplementing the original plan, pay attention to: learning new skills, enriching writing abilities, and making our thinking leap forward, so that our skills also leap forward. Those who have never written poetry should give it a try; poetry can reflect current reality more quickly. Those who have never written lyrics should give it a try; the whole country urgently needs new songs to match the Great Leap Forward, so that everyone can sing and work even harder. Those who write commentaries should try creative writing, and those who do creative writing should also try writing commentaries. Similarly, try crosstalk, drum lyrics, and even various operas. We want our plans to come together to form a literary department store, with everything available, and with new styles and the characteristics of popularization and improvement. It is truly a hundred flowers blooming, bold creation. This is very beneficial to the people and to ourselves. We take this opportunity to train ourselves into writers who are proficient in all forms of writing, and the people can therefore take what they need and love our works more, read more works, and both writing and reading will leap forward together.

Writers who have not yet made a plan must make one immediately and submit it to the Writers Association or branch. Amateur writers who have published works but are not yet members of the Writers Association can also do so, so that we can closely connect with each other.

Please make plans! With plans and indicators, it is easier to supervise, compete, inspect, and evaluate. We must know what we want to do and how much we want to do; the Writers Association must also know what everyone wants to do and how much they want to do, in order to assist and inspect. In the Great Leap Forward, individual labor must have collective supervision, so that everyone can work quickly and well with one heart. We want to know how many million tons of steel will be produced this year, and everyone wants to know how many works we will write. We may not like numbers, but in the socialist Great Leap Forward, everything must be accounted for. If one thousand writers, in addition to writing long works, also plan to write ten short articles each, then ten thousand articles will be produced in a year. If the Writers Association publishes this number, we will have no way to back down. We must leap forward, and therefore we must have a creative plan, in order to complete the plan and overfulfill the plan. Our plan is a promise, a contract, and we must not fail to fulfill it or break our promise to the people!

Comrades, make plans and start implementing them immediately! If there are difficulties, overcome them! If you need assistance, tell the Writers Association. Only when every writer has the determination to leap forward can the literary cause truly prosper! The people are working selflessly and eagerly hoping for good poems, good dramas, good essays, good novels, and all kinds of good works! The more actively they work, the more urgently they need literature and art. Comrades, bring out your greatest revolutionary spirit, go to the masses, learn from the people, and write for the people: write more, write faster, write well, write vividly and concisely! We write ourselves, and we also motivate and help others to write. Comrades, besides conservative thinking and bureaucratism, sluggishness, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness - the five evil tendencies - nothing can stop our Great Leap Forward.

### 中国作家协会发出响亮号召  作家们！跃进，大跃进

    中国作家协会发出响亮号召
    作家们！跃进，大跃进
    新华社7日讯　为了推动文学工作大跃进，中国作家协会7日在题为“作家们！跃进，大跃进！”的一封信里，向全国作家发出响亮的号召。这封信的全文如下：
    六亿人民的社会主义大跃进的高潮已到，人人兴奋，个个当先，随时随地出现奇迹。一天的奇迹就够写成许多部史诗、戏剧和小说的。作家、理论家、翻译家同志们，我们怎能不高兴、不狂喜，不想变成三头六臂，眼观六路，耳听八方，双管齐下，快马加鞭，及时报道，及时歌颂，鼓舞更大的干劲，叫前人所不敢梦想的每一天，每一小时，每一分钟，都实现在我们眼前呢！
    去年，全国几百位作家制订了创作计划。在今天的形势下，我们要求这些作家们作到：
      （一）坚决执行计划，提前兑现。
      （二）修正补充原订计划，把量力而为，从容不迫变为全力以赴，即刻杀上前去，叫我们的计划成为作家队伍中的“急先锋”的计划。每个计划都必须增补上反映和鼓舞当前大跃进的短小精悍的作品若干篇。原定的长篇一定要照计划而行，既快又好，保证质量。同时，也必定写些短的，随时发表。我们舞长枪，也要短棒，不论长短，一概要有所创造。
      （三）在修正补充原定计划的时候，要注意到：学习新的技巧，充实写作本领，使我们的思想跃进，本领也跃进。没写过诗的，试试看；诗能更快的反映当前现实。没写过歌词的，试试看；全国到处都迫切需要配合跃进的新歌，大家都唱起来，干劲就更大。写评论的试试创作，创作的也试试评论。同样地，试试相声、鼓词，以至各种戏曲。要叫我们的计划凑在一起就是文学百货供应总站，要什么有什么，而且具有新的风格，和有普及而提高的特色。真乃是百花齐放，大胆创造。这对人民和我们自己都大有好处，我们乘此机会把自己锻炼成文武昆乱不挡的作家，人民也因此可以各取所需，更爱我们的作品，更多读作品，写的看的一齐跃进。
    还没有制订计划的作家，都须马上拟制，分别交给作家协会或分会。发表过作品而还不是作家协会会员的业余作家也可以这么办，从此我们就能密切地互相联系。
    请作计划！有规划，有指标，就便于督促、竞赛、检查与评比。我们必须知道自己要作什么，要作多少；作家协会也必须知道大家都要作什么，要作多少，以便协助与检查。在大跃进中，个人的劳动须有集体的督促，这才能大家一个劲儿都干得又快又好。我们愿意知道今年产生多少百万吨钢，大家也愿意知道我们写出多少作品。我们也许不喜欢数字，但是在社会主义大跃进里事事都要算账。假若一千位作家在写长篇之外，还计划都写十篇短文，一年便出一万篇。“作协”把这个数字公布出去，我们便无法打退堂鼓。我们必须跃进，也就必须有创作计划，以便完成计划，超额完成计划。我们的计划是诺言，是合同，不许落空，失信于人民！
    同志们，制订计划并马上动手执行计划吧！有困难，克服！要求援助，告诉作家协会。每个作家都有跃进的决心，文学事业才会有真正的繁荣！人民都在忘我地劳动，都切盼得到好的诗歌，好的戏剧，好的散文，好的小说，各种各样的好作品！劳动越积极，越迫切需要文艺。同志们，拿出最大的革命干劲，到群众中去，向人民学习，为人民写作：多写、快写、写的好、写的生动精炼！我们自己写，也带动并帮助别人写。同志们，除了保守思想和官气、暮气、阔气、骄气与娇气五道邪气，没有任何东西能够挡住我们大跃进的。
