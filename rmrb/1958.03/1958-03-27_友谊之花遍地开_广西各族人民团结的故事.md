Flowers of Friendship Bloom Everywhere
-- Stories of Solidarity Among the People of All Ethnic Groups in Guangxi

	Sharing Hardships in the Past
	Producing Together Today
	Chairman Mao!
	You are like the bright red sun;
	Red! So red!
	Shining golden light on the Yao Mountains;
	The Zhuang brothers and sisters at the foot of the mountains,
	Helping the Yao families with their farming;
	The Yao and Zhuang brothers are one family,
	Building our homes together through unity and mutual assistance.

This is a song sung by the Yao farmers of Liangzhu Village in Bama County, Guangxi. It sings of the friendship between them and the Zhuang farmers.

Originally, during the First Domestic Revolutionary War, the Zhuang farmers, Han farmers, and Yao farmers in Donglan, Bama, Fengshan and other counties had established a fighting friendship. In 1947, the Zhuang farmers of Polei Village in Bama County, under the persecution of the Kuomintang bandits, all twenty-one households in the village fled to Xishan. The Yao farmers in Xishan hid the Zhuang elders, women, and children, and united with the Zhuang farmers to fight against the Kuomintang bandits. After liberation, the Zhuang farmers returned to Polei Village from Xishan and rebuilt their homes.

In May 1952, with the help of the people's government, twelve poor Yao families living in Xishan moved to a place near Polei Village to settle down and produce, and named it Liangzhu Village. The Zhuang farmers of Polei Village warmly welcomed the Yao brothers who had shared life and death, and gave more than 30 mu of terraced fields to the Yao farmers. The young Zhuang men and women farmers also helped the Yao farmers build houses and reclaim wasteland. The Yao farmers who had lived in the rocky mountains for a long time did not understand the technology of growing paddy fields, so more than 40 young Zhuang men and women from Polei Village helped them. In 1953, more than 100 mu of corn in Liangzhu Village failed, and some Yao farmers became uneasy about production. Huang Fukang, a Zhuang farmer from Polei Village, went to Liangzhu Village to explain the reasons for the crop failure to the Yao farmers, explaining that this was because the corn seeds grown in the high and cold mountains were not suitable for planting on warm earthen slopes. In the spring ploughing of 1954, the Zhuang farmers of Polei Village sent more than 200 jin of local corn seeds, and also went to other villages to exchange seeds for the Yao farmers. This year, Liangzhu Village had a bumper harvest of corn. In the winter of 1955, all the Yao farmers of Liangzhu Village joined the cooperative of Zhuang farmers in Polei Village. In the past few years, this cooperative has increased production year after year, and every household has increased its income.

"Unity Pond"

The Sanli Agricultural Cooperative in Tiandong County has 86 Yao members. They live in the rocky mountains. Every day, the Yao members have to cross mountains and ridges to San Ka Village, more than five miles away, to fetch water to drink. One person can only carry four loads a day. Because they have to fetch water to drink, the Yao members can only work half a day a day to participate in production. Lin Yuansheng, the Zhuang production team leader of San Ka Village, suggested to the cooperative management committee that two reservoirs should be built to help the Yao members. After the cooperative management committee and the CPC branch solicited the consent of the Yao members, they built two reservoirs in Nonglue and Dinglue, solving the difficulty of drinking and using water for the Yao members. The Yao members of the Sanli Cooperative excitedly called the newly built two reservoirs "Unity Pond."

The Origin of "Katong"

In the Zhuang area of ​​western Guangxi, when people of similar ages meet, they will warmly greet: "Katong, bei que lie! Hou lan geng yan geng cha kuan!" ("Katong!" Where are you going? Please come to my house for a smoke and a cup of tea!) The term "Katong" makes people feel like they've met before.

There is a moving story about the origin of the term "Katong." A long time ago, in Huanjiang County, there were three young men of similar ages, one Han and two Zhuang, who worked as long-term laborers in the same landlord's house. They grazed sheep for the landlord during the day and patrolled and tended to things for the landlord at night.

One severe winter night, it was snowing and raining, and the cold wind was biting. The three young men were extremely tired. In addition, they had no clothes on their bodies and no food in their stomachs. How could they patrol the entire manor in the wide courtyard of the "corridor that arrows could not shoot through"? So, they ran into the sheepfold, lay on the sheep to keep warm, and unknowingly fell asleep. The next day, the landlord discovered it and beat them all black and blue. The three young men could no longer bear it and decided to take revenge. One day, when the landlord was sitting by the fish pond watching the swimming fish for pleasure, they pushed the landlord into the fish pond and drowned him. Afterwards, they fled into the deep mountains, reclaimed wasteland, and lived a free life. The three of them shared hardships together and shared happiness, and they believed that this was caused by the guidance of the gods. In this way, they became sworn brothers and called each other "Katong."

This beautiful story is still circulating among the people. In order to show friendship, whether between Han and Zhuang, or between Zhuang and Zhuang, as long as they are of similar age, even if they do not know each other, they call each other "Katong." (Attached picture)

    友谊之花遍地开
    ——广西各族人民团结的故事
    昔日共患难
    今日同生产
    毛主席啥！
    你像红鲜的太阳呐；
    红啥红啥！
    照得瑶山金光亮呐；
    山下僮族妹哥啥，
    帮助瑶家耕田啥；
    瑶僮兄弟一家亲啥，
    团结互助建家园呐。
    这是广西巴马县良竹屯的瑶族农民唱的。歌唱他们与僮族农民间的友谊。
    原来在第一次国内革命战争时期，东兰、巴马、凤山等县的僮族农民和汉族农民、瑶族农民就建立了战斗的友谊。1947年，巴马县坡累屯的僮族农民在国民党匪帮迫害下，全村二十一户全都逃往西山。西山上的瑶族农民把僮族老人、妇女和小孩藏起来，和僮族农民团结一起向国民党匪帮进行斗争。解放后，僮族农民才从西山回到坡累屯，重建家园。
    1952年5月，住在西山上的十二户贫苦瑶族，在人民政府帮助下迁到坡累屯附近的地方安居生产，取名叫良竹屯。坡累屯的僮族农民热情地接待了同生死共患难的瑶族弟兄，把三十多亩梯田送给瑶族农民。僮族的青年男女农民还帮助瑶族农民造房子、开荒。长期居住在石山上的瑶族农民不懂种水田的技术，坡累屯的僮族四十多个男女青年就帮助他们。1953年，良竹屯一百多亩玉米失收，有些瑶族农民便不安心生产了。坡累屯的僮族农民黄福康，便去良竹屯向瑶族农民解释失收的原因，说明这是因为山上高寒地方种的玉米种子，不适宜种在暖和的土坡上。1954年春耕时，坡累屯的僮族农民送去二百多斤本地玉米种子，还到别的村子去给瑶族农民换种子。这一年良竹屯的玉米便获得了丰收。1955年冬天，良竹屯瑶族农民全都加入了坡累屯的僮族农民的合作社。几年来这个社年年增产，户户增加收入。
    “团结池”
    田东县三力农业社，有八十六户瑶族社员。他们住在石山上。每天瑶族社员都要翻山越岭到五里多路的三卡屯去挑水吃，一天一个人只能挑四担。因为要挑水吃，瑶族社员每天只能出半天工参加生产。三卡屯的僮族生产队长林元生向社管理委员会建议，要帮助瑶族社员修两个蓄水池。社管理委员会和中共党支部征求了瑶族社员的同意后，便在弄略和定略两处修了两个蓄水池，解决了瑶族社员吃水和用水困难。三力社瑶族社员们兴奋地把新修的两个蓄水池叫作“团结池”。
    “卡同”的来历
    在桂西僮族地区，年龄相仿的人相遇，就会热情的招呼：“卡同，辈却烈！吼栏更烟更茶宽”（“卡同！”你去哪里？请到家里抽烟喝茶）！称呼“卡同”这个字眼，使人一见如故。
  “卡同”这个称呼传说有一段动人的来历。很久以前，在环江县有三个年纪相仿的小伙子，一个是汉族，两个是僮族，他们三人同在一个地主家当长工。他们白天给地主放羊，夜里还得给地主巡更打点。
    一个严冬的晚上，雪雨纷飞，寒风刺骨。三个小伙子疲劳极了，再加上他们身上无衣，肚中无食，在那“弓箭射不过的廊房”的宽大庄院里，怎能巡遍全庄呢？于是，他们就跑进羊圈里，伏在羊身上取暖，不知不觉三个人都睡着了。第二天地主发觉了，把他三个人打的遍体鳞伤。这三个小伙子实在忍无可忍，生法要报仇雪恨。一天，当地主坐在鱼池旁边看游鱼取乐时，他们便把地主推到鱼池中淹死了。以后，他们便逃到深山里开荒，过着自由自在的日子。他们三个人共同经历了苦难，又分享了快乐，他们认为这是神仙指引所致。这样便结成生死之交，互称为“卡同”。
    这个美丽的故事，直到现在还在人们中间流传着。为了表明友爱，不论汉族与僮族，或者僮族与僮族之间见面，只要年龄不相上下，虽不相识，也相互称呼“卡同”。（附图片）
