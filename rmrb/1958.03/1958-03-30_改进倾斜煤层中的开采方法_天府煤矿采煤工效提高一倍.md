Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 29th. Workers at the Tianfu Coal Mine in Sichuan Province have improved coal mining methods in steeply inclined coal seams, increasing the efficiency of each coal mining face by onefold compared to the past, creating technical conditions for this year's Great Leap Forward in production.

Tianfu Coal Mine's coal production plan for this year has increased from 680,000 tons of actual coal production last year to 1,080,000 tons, and the original coal mining methods could not adapt to this leap forward requirement. Because most of the coal mining faces at Tianfu Coal Mine are thin coal seams with a large inclination, the "inverted terrace" coal mining method was used in the past, with only one coal miner in each terrace, who could only advance two meters per day, greatly limiting the amount of coal produced.

In late February of this year, engineers and technicians from No. 1 mine discussed together and believed that each terrace could have two coal miners mining at the same time. However, adding a coal miner presented many technical difficulties, the most prominent being safety issues, as the coal mined by the upper miner could easily hit the person below; with only one meter separating the two people vertically, they would also hinder each other's work. In order to solve this series of problems, the leaders of No. 1 mine convened a symposium of team leaders and veteran workers. After three days of debate, the workers finally found a solution: when the night shift workers prepare for coal mining the next day, they first dig a small portion of the top of the terrace three meters in, and make it into a terraced shape. In this way, two workers mining in the same terrace can work one in front of the other. From February 25th to the first half of March, engineers, technicians, and workers conducted multiple trials underground. According to the results of a test at a coal mining face, the daily coal production has increased from more than 180 tons in the past to more than 360 tons.

Currently, the mine is actively preparing to promote this new coal mining method throughout the entire mine.

### 改进倾斜煤层中的开采方法  天府煤矿采煤工效提高一倍

    改进倾斜煤层中的开采方法
    天府煤矿采煤工效提高一倍
    新华社重庆29日电　四川省天府煤矿职工在急倾斜煤层中改进采煤方法，使每个采煤工作面的工效比过去提高一倍，为今年的生产大跃进创造了技术条件。
    天府煤矿今年的产煤计划由去年实际产煤六十八万吨提高到一百零八万吨，原有的采煤方法就不能适应这一跃进要求了。天府煤矿因为大部分采煤工作面都是薄煤层，煤层倾斜度很大，以往都采用“倒台阶”的采煤方法，每个台阶里只有一个采煤工，一天只能进两公尺，产煤数量受到很大限制。
    今年2月下旬，一井的工程技术人员和工人一起讨论，认为每个台阶里可以由两个采煤工同时采煤。但是增加一个采煤工在技术上有许多困难，最突出的是安全问题，上面的采煤工采出来的煤很可能打在下面一个人的身上；两个人上下只隔一公尺，也会彼此妨碍对方的工作。为了解决这一系列问题，一井的领导人员召开了班组长和老工人座谈会。经过三天的辩论，工人们终于找出了解决的办法：每天的夜班工人为第二天采煤做准备工作时，先把台阶顶部的一小部分煤挖进三公尺，并且做成台阶形。这样，两个在同一台阶里采煤的工人，就能一前一后地工作了。从2月25日起到3月上半月，工程技术人员和工人一起在井下进行了多次试验。根据在一个采煤工作面试验的结果，每天的煤产量已经由过去的一百八十多吨提高到三百六十多吨。
    现在，这个矿正积极准备将这一新的采煤方法在全矿推行。
