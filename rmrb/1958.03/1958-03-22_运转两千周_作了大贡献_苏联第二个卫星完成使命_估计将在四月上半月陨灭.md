    Operated for Two Thousand Revolutions, Made Great Contributions
    Soviet Second Satellite Completes its Mission
    Estimated to Burn Up in the First Half of April
    (Our newspaper, Moscow, 21st dispatch) The Soviet Union's second artificial satellite had already revolved around the Earth two thousand times by 6:00 PM (Moscow time) on March 21st. Since its launch on November 3rd of last year, it has been operating in the atmosphere for one hundred and thirty-eight days and nights, covering a distance of eighty-nine million kilometers. There are now two hundred observation stations in the world (eighty of which are in the Soviet Union) observing the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite. It is estimated that the second artificial satellite will enter the dense atmosphere and burn up between April 5th and 15th.
    In an article in "Pravda," Soviet scholar Krasovsky said that the period after the artificial satellite enters the dense atmosphere is the most valuable for scientific research. Now, based on the observation materials of the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite and its carrier rocket, it can be concluded that most of the meteors in the sky are not solid stone or metal bodies, but loose objects like cotton or smoke. Meteors visible to the human eye probably weigh only one gram and have a diameter of only a few centimeters. Krasovsky also said: "The last stage of the first artificial satellite's existence was very short, and the materials obtained were also very limited, but it is believed that the observation of the second artificial satellite and subsequent artificial satellites will provide more detailed research data."

    运转两千周　作了大贡献
    苏联第二个卫星完成使命
    估计将在四月上半月陨灭
    本报莫斯科21日电　苏联第二颗人造卫星在3月21日十八点（莫斯科时间）已经围绕地球运转了两千周。自去年11月3日发射后，它已经在大气中运转了一百三十八昼夜，运行路程达八千九百万公里。现在世界上有二百个观察站（其中八十个在苏联）对苏联第二颗人造卫星进行了观察。据估计，第二颗人造卫星在4月5日至15日间将进入稠密的大气层而陨灭。
    苏联学者克拉索夫斯基在“真理报”的一篇文章中说，人造卫星进入稠密的大气层以后的一段期间在科学研究上最有价值，现在根据对苏联第一颗人造卫星及其运送火箭的观察材料可以断定：天空中的大部分流星并不是坚固的石体或金属体，而是像一团棉絮或烟一样的松软物体，人眼可以看到的流星大概只有一克重，它们的直径只有数公分。克拉索夫斯基还说：“第一颗人造卫星存在的最后一个阶段时间很短，所得的材料也很有限，但是可以相信，对第二颗人造卫星及以后几颗人造卫星的观察将会提供更详细的研究资料。”
