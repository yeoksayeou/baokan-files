    Wangfujing Street in Beijing
    Zhang Runpu
    Beijing, before the Five Dynasties period in our country, was originally a region governed by a military commissioner of Youzhou. During the Later Tang Dynasty of the Five Dynasties, Shi Jingtang of Hedong, in order to become emperor, ceded Youzhou and fifteen other prefectures and cities to the Liao emperor, Yelu Deguang. Yelu Deguang then made Youzhou his "Southern Capital," calling it Xijin Prefecture. This happened in 936 AD, which is one thousand and twenty-two years ago from now. However, the capital of Liao was in the Upper Capital, and the Southern Capital was only one of its secondary capitals. Beijing officially served as the capital of a country during three dynasties in history—the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.

    The current Wangfujing Street was built during the reign of Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty. It was Emperor Chengzu Zhu Di of the Ming Dynasty who, in the fifteenth year of Yongle (1417 AD), ordered the Ministry of Works to build ten royal mansions with more than 8,000 rooms outside the Dong'an Gate on the east side of the imperial city, which is now the area south of Dong'anmenwai Street. Therefore, this place was later called Shi Wangfu (Ten Royal Mansions). The main street east of the royal mansions was called Wangfu Street. Later, because there was a Sweet Water Well to the west of Wangfu Street, and the water in the well tasted particularly good, it was called Wangfujing (Wangfu Well).

    Fifty years ago, there were very few shops on Wangfujing Street. In the thirtieth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, because the Dong'anmen Liwai Street was being built, all the floating stalls on the north and south sides of the street were moved to the south side of the street at the west entrance of Jinyu Hutong, and the Dong'an Market was built here. Since then, the number of shops on Wangfujing Street has gradually increased, becoming a bustling street.

    After liberation, Wangfujing Street not only cleaned up the streets and tidied up the trees on both sides of the road, but also built the Department Store Building. Today's Wangfujing Street has become the commercial and cultural center of Beijing. On holidays, just look at the lively scene! (Attached picture)

    北京的王府井大街
    张润普
    北京这地方，在我国五代以前，本是幽州的一个节度使所管的地区。五代后唐河东石敬塘，为了作皇帝，把幽州和其他的十五个州的城池献给了辽国皇帝耶律德光。耶律德光便把幽州作了他的“南京”，称为析津府。这是公元936年的事情，离现在已经有一千零二十二年了。但辽的首都在上京，南京只是陪都之一。北京正式作为一个国家的首都，在历史上有三个朝代——元朝、明朝和清朝。
    现在的王府井大街，是明成祖时代修建的。是明成祖朱棣，在永乐十五年（公元1417年）命令工部在皇城东面东安门外，盖了十座王府，共八千多间房屋，也就是现在东安门外街南的地方。所以后来就称此地为十王府。王府的东边大街，就称王府街。以后又因为王府街西，有座甜水井，井里的水特别好喝，因此就叫王府井。
    五十年前，王府井大街店铺很少，清光绪三十年，因为修筑东安门里外大街马路，就把街南北的浮摊，全移在金鱼胡同西口街南，并在这里建筑了东安市场。从此，王府井大街的商店逐渐增多，变为繁华的街道。
    解放以后的王府井大街，不但清理了街道，整齐了马路两旁的树木，还修建了百货大楼。今天的王府井大街，已经成为北京商业和文化的中心区域，到了假日，你瞧瞧那股热闹劲吧！（附图片）
