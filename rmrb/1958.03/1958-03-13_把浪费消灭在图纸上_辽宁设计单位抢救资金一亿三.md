Eliminate Waste on the Blueprints

Liaoning Design Units Recover 130 Million Yuan in Funds

(This report) The technical personnel of various design units in Liaoning Province, during the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, not only exposed a large number of wasteful phenomena, but also launched a surge to improve design quality, improve design work, and plug loopholes for waste. According to preliminary statistics from ten design units, a total of more than 133.9 million yuan in funds have been recovered for the state.

The leading cadres and technical personnel of various design units in Shenyang have carefully reviewed plans, revised designs, and boldly adopted new technical measures, saving the state a total of more than 120 million yuan in investment. The Non-ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute recovered 6.12 million yuan in construction funds by reviewing only three key project designs. The Coal Mine Design Institute preliminarily reviewed thirteen individual projects and saved the state more than 1.36 million yuan. The Northeast Design Institute took the initiative and, for projects where design modifications were needed, proactively sent personnel, telegrams, and letters to consult with relevant departments to recover wasted resources. They contracted the design of the Ministry of Forestry's adhesive factory project. The original design standards were too high, so they proactively consulted with the client to lower the standards, saving more than 6.17 million yuan on this one project alone. All departments of the Anshan Design Institute established mass organizations such as "Waste Burning Groups," "Savings Inspection Groups," and "Rescue Groups," using methods such as introducing projects and reviewing drawings to uncover waste and propose improvement suggestions. The Coking and Mechanical Manufacturing Departments alone proposed 324 rationalization proposals, which could save the state more than 2.776 million yuan. The technical personnel of the Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute proactively went to the work site to solicit opinions on the design from construction units; in one week, they proposed 28 saving suggestions, which could save the state more than 2 million yuan in investment.

    把浪费消灭在图纸上
    辽宁设计单位抢救资金一亿三
    本报讯　辽宁省各设计单位的技术人员在反浪费反保守运动中，不仅揭发了大量的浪费现象，还掀起了提高设计质量、改进设计工作，堵塞浪费漏洞的热潮。据十个设计单位的初步统计，共给国家抢救资金一亿三千九百多万元。
    沈阳各设计单位的领导干部和技术人员一起认真审查方案，修改设计，大胆采用新的技术措施，共给国家节省投资一亿两千多万元。有色冶金设计院仅审查三项重点工程设计，就抢救回六百一十二万元的建设资金。煤矿设计院初步审查了十三个单项工程，就给国家节省资金一百三十六万多元。东北设计院发挥主动精神，对应该修改设计的工程，主动派人、发电报、写信同有关部门进行商量，抢救浪费。他们承包林业部烤胶厂工程的设计，原来设计标准太高，他们便主动和甲方研究降低标准，仅这一项工程就节省六百一十七万余元。鞍山设计院各科室都成立了火烧浪费组、节约检查组、抢救组等群众性组织，运用介绍工程、审查图纸的方法，挖掘浪费，提出改进意见。仅焦化科、机械制造科就提出三百二十四条合理化建议，可给国家节约二百七十七万六千多元。黑色冶金设计院技术人员主动深入现场，广泛征求施工单位对设计的意见；在一周内提出二十八项节约建议，可给国家节省投资二百多万元。
