    More, Faster, Better, and More Economical is Entirely Possible
    Comrade Zeng Xisheng Discusses Anhui's Water Conservancy Construction Work
    (Our Dispatch) Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, recently stated in a meeting, when talking about Anhui's experience in water conservancy construction during last winter and this spring, that Anhui's development in water conservancy construction proves that the "more, faster, better, and more economical" construction policy is completely correct and entirely achievable. Thoroughly conducting large-scale airing of views, debates, and wall posters, criticizing right-leaning conservative thoughts, and opposing retreatism are powerful guarantees for relying on the masses to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    Comrade Zeng Xisheng said that during the water conservancy conference held in Anhui Province last October, many people believed that it would be good if more than 400 million cubic meters of earthwork for farmland water conservancy projects could be completed last winter and this spring. This was because, during the high tide of cooperativization in the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956, the province completed 460 million cubic meters of earthwork, while in the winter of 1956 and the spring of 1957, only 270 million cubic meters were completed. At the water conservancy conference, the investment for small-scale farmland water conservancy projects alone was estimated at over 90 million yuan. But what was the result? After the masses were mobilized, 800 million cubic meters were completed in two months. At the end of December, the Provincial Party Committee proposed doubling it again, increasing it to 1.6 billion cubic meters. These 800 million cubic meters of earthwork were completed even faster, taking only a little over a month from proposal to completion. After the 1.6 billion cubic meters were completed, in order to complete the unfinished projects and strengthen the quality of some projects that were not well done, the Provincial Party Committee again proposed increasing it by another 800 million cubic meters. Thus, the total amount was 2.4 billion cubic meters. This figure is six times the initial plan and one and a half times the total amount of work done in the past eight years. The completion of nearly 2 billion cubic meters of work in one winter fundamentally changed the previous situation of slackening first and then rushing in water conservancy construction. In the past, only 30% to 40% of the plan could be completed in winter, and most of the projects were rushed in the spring. This year, the situation was completely reversed. Not only were plans constantly broken and added to, but about 90% of the projects were completed in one winter, truly achieving the requirement of speed. All small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, except for the payment of 3 million yuan for the construction tools and important equipment, did not require state investment for the remaining earthwork. In the past few years, the number of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects was much smaller than last winter and this spring, but the state investment reached more than 13 million yuan. Therefore, the requirement of "economy" was also done very well. In terms of project quality, according to inspections in various places, most of them meet the standards, and the few that do not meet the standards can also be guaranteed in quality after inspection and repair. This shows that as long as we strengthen leadership, boldly mobilize the masses, it is entirely possible to realize the central government's policy of more, faster, better, and more economical in construction.
    When talking about Anhui's current water conservancy work tasks, Comrade Zeng Xisheng said: The plan of 2.4 billion cubic meters of earthwork has long been overfulfilled, and now it has reached more than 3 billion cubic meters. The main tasks at present are: first, to carefully check the quality of the projects, strengthen the management of the completed projects, so that every cubic meter of earth can generate benefits in this year's agricultural production; second, to check whether the projects done are adapted to this year's agricultural production plan. Where the project is less and the water is insufficient, it is necessary to catch up quickly to ensure that the production increase plan can be guaranteed; if the water volume cannot be guaranteed, the plan for changing rice cultivation should be reduced appropriately. Where the water volume is surplus, the rice cultivation plan should be revised so that the water conservancy project can play the greatest role in production; third, the mass small-scale projects should also be summarized, and good experiences should be promoted in a timely manner; the overall provincial plan and thousands of small project plans should be connected together, so that large and medium-sized projects can ensure the supply of water when small-scale projects such as ditches and ponds are short of water, and ensure timely drainage when there is too much water. He said that these tasks have already begun in various places, but they must be done carefully. Only by doing these tasks well, and letting water conservancy projects play the greatest benefit in agricultural production increase, can we truly achieve the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical, and encourage the masses to build water conservancy on an even grander scale in the future.
    He went on to point out that Anhui's ability to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results in water conservancy construction last winter and this spring was mainly because right-leaning conservative thoughts were vigorously criticized and retreatism was opposed through large-scale airing of views, debates, and wall posters. There are two very obvious points here: one is because right-leaning conservative thoughts have been overcome and the viewpoint of truly relying on the masses and following the mass line has been established; the other is because right-leaning conservative thoughts have been overcome and the correct water management policy of focusing on small-scale projects has been established. He said that this year, relying on the masses in water conservancy construction not only relied on the labor and materials of the masses, but also relied on the wisdom of the masses. It is easy for ordinary people to see that the masses have strength, but they often fail to see that the masses have wisdom. After the criticism of right-leaning conservative thoughts last winter, the routine of the state contracting everything was broken, and the masses were boldly allowed to exert their wisdom. As a result, not only were many small and general projects built, but also many drainage and irrigation projects that had been considered very difficult for many years were built in a few months. In the past, general projects relied on the upper levels for planning and the masses for construction, and the masses were passive; now, the method of counties, townships, and communes all making their own plans and carrying out their own construction has been implemented, and the masses have shown initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity. Many technical problems, as long as the upper levels make a point, the masses can create a lot and give full play. For example, the improvement of water conservancy construction tools is a good example. The high efficiency and rapid progress of water conservancy construction this year are greatly related to this. The rapid development of water conservancy projects last winter and this spring was the result of overcoming right-leaning conservative thoughts and believing in the wisdom and strength of the masses.

    多快好省完全可能
    曾希圣同志谈安徽水利建设工作
    本报讯　中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣同志，最近在一次会议上谈到安徽去冬今春兴修水利的体会时说，安徽兴修水利的发展情况证明：“多快好省”的建设方针是完全正确、完全可以做到的；而通过大放大鸣大辩论，批判右倾保守思想，反掉促退主义，则是依靠群众做到多快好省的有力保证。
    曾希圣同志说，安徽省在去年10月开水利会议时，不少人认为，去冬今春能够作四亿多土方的农田水利工程就算不错了。因为全省在合作化高潮的1955年冬1956年春，才做了四亿六千万土方，而1956年冬到1957年春才做了二亿七千万土方。在水利会议上，各地只是小型农田水利的投资就要九千多万元。可是结果怎样呢？当群众发动起来以后，两个月的时间便完成了八亿方。12月底，省委提出再翻一翻，增加到十六亿方。这八亿方土完成得更快，从提出到完成只有一个多月的时间。十六亿土方完成后，为了完成未完的工程，加强部分工程质量不好的工程，省委又提出再增加八亿土方的号召。这样，前后总计是二十四亿土方。这个数字等于最初计划的六倍，为八年来工程总和的一倍半，而一个冬天即完成近二十亿方的工程，根本改变了过去兴修水利中前松后紧的状况。过去冬季只能完成计划的30％到40％，大部分的工程都挤到春季来赶工。今年则完全相反，不仅不断突破追加计划，而且在一个冬天即完成了工程的90％左右，真正达到了快的要求。全部小型农田水利工程，除支付兴修工具和重要器材方面用了三百万元外，其余土方都没有要国家投资。过去几年兴修的小型农田水利工程数量比去冬今春少得多，而国家投资却达一千三百多万元。所以“省”的要求也是做得很好的。在工程质量方面，据各地检查大部分都合乎标准，少数不合乎标准的，经过边检查边补修，质量也能够得到保证。这就说明，只要加强领导，放手发动群众，在建设中实现中央多快好省的方针是完全可能的。
    谈到安徽目前水利工作任务时，曾希圣同志说：二十四亿土方的计划早已超额完成，现在达到了三十多亿方土。目前主要任务，第一是认真检查工程的质量，加强已做工程的管理，使每方土都能在今年的农业生产中发生效益。第二是检查所作工程和今年农业生产计划是否适应。工程做得少而水不够用的地方，要迅速赶上去，使增产计划确实能有保证；如果水量不能保证时，则应酌量减低稻改计划。水量有余的地方，稻改计划应该修订，以便水利工程在生产中发挥最大作用。第三是对群众性的小型工程还要进行总结，及时推广好的经验；要把全省总的规划和千千万万个小的工程规划连接起来，在小型工程沟塘等缺水时，大中型工程能够保证水的供应，在水多时能够保证及时排泄。他说，现在这些工作各地都已开始进行了，但是一定要认真作好。只有作好这些工作，让水利工程在农业增产中发挥最大效益，才能算是真正达到了多快好省的要求，才能鼓舞群众在今后以更为雄伟的规模兴修水利。
    他接着指出，去冬今春安徽兴修水利能够取得多快好省的成绩，主要是因为通过大放大鸣大辩论，有力地批判了右倾保守思想，反掉了促退主义。在这里有两点是十分明显的，一是因为克服了右倾保守思想，树立了真正依靠群众，走群众路线的观点；一是因为克服了右倾保守思想，树立了以小型为主的正确治水方针。他说，今年在兴修水利中依靠群众不仅是依靠了群众的劳力、物力，而更大的特点是依靠了群众的智慧。一般人对群众有力量这一点是容易看到的，但是对于群众有智慧这一点则常常看不到。去冬对右倾保守思想批判以后，一切工程由国家包办的常规被打破了，大胆地让群众发挥自己的智慧，结果不但兴修了许多小型的一般工程，并且把许多年来认为困难很大的排灌工程，几个月内也修建起来了。过去一般工程都靠上边规划，群众施工，群众是被动的；现在执行了县、乡、社都自己作规划，自己施工的办法，群众就表现了主动性、积极性和创造性。很多技术问题，只要上边提一点，群众就能大量创造，大大发挥。譬如对兴修水利工具的改进问题就是一个很好的例子。今年水利兴修中工效高，进度快，和这一点大有关系。去冬今春水利工程发展如此迅速就是由于克服了右倾保守思想，相信了群众的智慧和力量所得到的结果。
