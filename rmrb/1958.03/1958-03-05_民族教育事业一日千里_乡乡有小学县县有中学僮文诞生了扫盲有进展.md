National Education Flourishes

Every Township Has Elementary Schools, Every County Has Middle Schools, Zhuang Script is Born, Literacy Progresses

Zhao Lequn (Zhuang Nationality), Deputy Director of the Guangxi Zhuang Script Promotion Committee

In the past eight years, under the glorious light of the Party's ethnic policies, Guangxi's ethnic education has greatly developed. According to the 1957 statistics, there were 15,035 elementary schools in the minority nationality residential areas of the province, accounting for 68% of the total number of elementary schools in the province, achieving the goal of having an elementary school in every township (referring to the townships before the merger). In terms of secondary education, out of the 327 middle schools in the region, 157 are minority nationality schools. In order to cultivate more middle school students from the Miao, Yao, and other ethnic groups, preparatory classes for minority nationality students have been set up in several middle schools since 1957. Now, every county has a middle school. In terms of normal school education, nine of the thirteen normal schools in the region are ethnic normal schools. In addition, we also established a Nationalities Institute to train cadres of various ethnic groups. In more than five years, it has trained more than 3,000 cadres from more than ten ethnic groups.

In January 1958, the State Council officially announced the Zhuang script scheme (draft). For the first time in history, the more than seven million Zhuang people have their own script, realizing a dream they have cherished for thousands of years. In just over half a year, more than 350,000 Zhuang people in more than 4,000 Zhuang townships enthusiastically participated in the study of Zhuang script, of which approximately more than 100,000 have learned Zhuang script and begun to break away from illiteracy.

Now, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has been established, and Guangxi's national education will surely continue to develop with the country's rapidly advancing construction upsurge. (Attached Picture)

    民族教育事业一日千里
    乡乡有小学县县有中学僮文诞生了扫盲有进展
    广西僮文推行委员会副主任　赵乐群（僮族）
    八年来，在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，广西的民族教育事业，已经有了很大的发展。据1957年的统计，全省少数民族居住地区的小学共有一万五千零三十五所，占全省小学总数的68％，已做到了乡乡（指并乡前的乡）有小学。在中学教育方面，全区三百二十七所中学中，少数民族学校就有一百五十七所。为了能够培养苗、瑶等族更多的中学生，从1957年起在若干中学中设了少数民族学生的预备班。现在，县县有了中学。师范教育方面，在全区十三所师范学校中，就有九所是民族师范。此外，我们还创办了一所培养各民族干部的民族学院，在五年多的时间里，共培养了十多个民族的干部三千多人。
    1958年1月，国务院正式公布了僮族文字方案（草案）。七百多万僮族人民在历史上第一次有了自己的文字，实现了千百年来梦寐以求的理想。仅仅半年多的时间，在四千多个僮族乡里，共有三十五万多的僮族群众热烈地参加了僮文的学习，其中，大约有十万以上的人已学会了僮文，开始摆脱文盲状态。
    现在，广西僮族自治区成立了，广西的民族教育事业必将随着祖国一日千里的建设高潮而继续发展。（附图片）
