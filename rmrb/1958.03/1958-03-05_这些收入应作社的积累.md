    These Incomes Should Be Used for the Collective Accumulation of the Commune
    The income of commune members in agricultural communes in urban suburbs is generally higher than that of commune members in agricultural communes farther away from the city. According to a feeder at a pig farm near Yuquan Road in the western suburbs of Beijing, commune members who regularly come to them to haul pig manure can earn more than 100 yuan per month if they work 28 labor days. Generally, female laborers can earn 40 to 50 or 60 yuan per month. Why is the income of commune members in suburban agricultural communes so high? There are roughly three reasons: ① There are many avenues for production, such as transportation and stone crushing; ② Urban institutions and schools often send people to agricultural communes to participate in voluntary labor, which increases the income of the agricultural communes; ③ Urban garbage and manure are mostly supplied to suburban agricultural communes as fertilizer without compensation, which reduces production costs and increases total income.
    As the total income of the commune increases, the personal income of the commune members also increases accordingly. However, the income increased due to the first and second reasons is not the result of the labor of the commune members. Therefore, I suggest that these incomes be converted into monetary amounts at price, deducted during the final accounting, and used to expand the public accumulation of the commune.

    这些收入应作社的积累
    城市郊区农业社社员的收入一般比离城远的农业社社员的收入要高一些。据北京西郊玉泉路附近一个养猪场的饲养员说，常来他们这里拉猪粪的社员每月如果做二十八个劳动日，就有一百多元的收入，一般妇女劳动力每月也可收入四十至五、六十元。郊区农业社社员的收入为什么这样高呢？大致有三个原因：①生产门路多，如运输、打石子等；②城市机关学校常有人去农业社参加义务劳动，为农业社增加了收入；③城市里的垃圾、粪便大部都是无代价地供给郊区农业社作肥料，这样减少了生产成本，增加了总收入。
    由于社的总收入增加，社员个人的收入也随着增加。但是，如第一、二两个原因所增加的收入，并不是社员劳动的结果，所以，我建议把这些收入按价折合金额，到决算时扣下来，扩大社的公共积累。
