Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 7th March: Zhejiang Province plans to build 100 biogas power stations in rural areas this year. Forty-one stations are to be built within March. This decision was made at the recent first provincial biogas conference.

These biogas power stations will conduct experiments on using human and animal manure, sludge, straw, etc., to produce biogas in rural areas, which will be used to power pumps, flour mills, and other machines. The methods developed will be promoted in key rural areas throughout the province.

Wu Xian, member of the Standing Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Governor of Zhejiang Province, said at the biogas conference that Zhejiang Province's coal production is still not high, and the construction of small hydropower stations is limited by natural conditions, while biogas raw materials are relatively easy to obtain. Therefore, fully utilizing biogas is an important way to solve the province's rural power source.

The Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee has established a "Biogas Experiment Group" and set up experimental biogas fermentation tanks in three units, including Zhejiang Agricultural College. During the conference, the representatives visited the biogas fermentation tanks of these three units and also visited the Hangzhou General Machinery Factory to see cars and generators powered by biogas.

This newspaper reports: In order to promote the experimental research on the comprehensive utilization of organic fertilizer biogas fermentation, Beijing recently established a Biogas Utilization Research Group. The units participating in the research group include the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Land Reclamation, the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing Agricultural University, and the Beijing Municipal Water and Sewerage Engineering Bureau. This research group was established at the biogas comprehensive utilization symposium held by the Ministry of Agriculture at the end of February.

The research group is temporarily planning to conduct four experiments, which will be carried out by the Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute, Beijing Agricultural University, and the Beijing Municipal Water and Sewerage Engineering Bureau. The experimental work has already begun.

### 利用粪便垃圾解决农村动力问题  浙江筹建百座沼气动力站  北京成立沼气利用研究组

    利用粪便垃圾解决农村动力问题
    浙江筹建百座沼气动力站
    北京成立沼气利用研究组
    据新华社杭州7日电　浙江省今年计划在农村中建立一百个沼气动力站。3月份内就要建立四十一个站。这项决定是最近召开的全省第一次沼气会议上作出的。
    这些沼气动力站将进行在农村中利用人畜粪便、污泥、稻草等制造沼气，用以发动抽水机、磨粉机等机器的试验。试验出来的办法，将在全省农村重点推广。
    中共浙江省委常委、浙江省副省长吴宪在这次沼气会议上讲话说，浙江省目前煤的产量也还不多，办小型水电站又要受到自然条件限制，而沼气的原料却比较易得。因此，充分利用沼气是解决全省农村动力来源的重要办法。
    浙江省人民委员会已经设立了“沼气试验组”，并在浙江农学院等三个单位设立试验性的沼气发酵池。在这次开会期间，代表们参观了这三个单位的沼气发酵池，还到杭州通用机器厂参观了用沼气发动汽车和发电机。
    本报讯　为了推动对有机质肥料沼气发酵综合利用的试验研究，北京最近成立了沼气利用研究组。参加研究组的，有国家计划委员会、农业部、农垦部、建筑工程部、中国农业科学院、北京农业大学、北京市上下水道工程局等单位。这个研究组是农业部在2月底召开的沼气综合利用座谈会上确定成立的。
    研究组暂定进行四个试验，由中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所、农业机械化研究所、北京农业大学、北京市上下水道工程局分别负责进行。现在，试验工作已经开始。
