    In Sangyang Village, Korea
    —Visiting a Collection of Korean Poems
    Premier Zhou Enlai visited Sangyang Village. An old farmer woman grabbed Premier Zhou's hand and said excitedly:
  “My son is the secretary of the Korean Workers' Party branch. He persisted in resisting American aggression in the village, and he was killed by the Americans! My whole family died in the American artillery fire. Thanks to the Chinese People's Volunteers for rescuing me from the flames. Otherwise, how could I have lived to this day?" "The Volunteers are my benefactors, they saved my life. I will try to live a few more years; I am already over sixty. I will work hard to build my country to repay the Volunteers. I will never forget the American army destroying my entire family.” Premier Kim Il-sung then said: "Comrade translator, please translate quickly. The old woman's words are very meaningful, please translate them to Premier Zhou." After hearing the translation, Premier Kim Il-sung used fluent Chinese to make a more accurate correction. Then Premier Kim Il-sung added: "The old woman's words represent and express the feelings of the Korean people towards the Chinese people." Premier Zhou held the old woman's hand and said to her:
  “What you said is very good! I am very grateful to you!
  “Speaking of gratitude, China and Korea owe each other a debt of gratitude. Because we aided you, and you also defended us.
  “Speaking of thanks, the people of China and Korea should both thank the People's Army and the Volunteers. They fought side by side and jointly defended the peace of the two peoples!
  “Old woman, old comrade, I wish you good health! I wish you success in completing your great aspiration to serve the motherland!" I am a member of the Chinese delegation, and I am not a poet by nature. But today, seeing a farmer woman standing between the Chinese Premier and the Korean Premier, their dialogue is truly moving and full of emotion! This is a real and beautiful poem. It infected me, making me, who cannot compose poetry, want to compose. I very simply record their words. I am very excited thinking: The friendship between China and Korea is truly forged in blood! This old woman is a witness. And there is also the Korean righteous man Park Jae-geun, who covered a wounded Volunteer soldier with his body. He died under a missile and saved this Volunteer. He is the benefactor of the Volunteer Army. Who can forget such kindness! Think about it, without the support of the people, how is it possible to defeat the invaders! Remember! Remember! The friendship between China and Korea is truly forged in blood! Such unity once defeated the attacking enemy. I want to be a poet and forever sing praises of this great communist friendship!

    在朝鲜的上阳村
    ——访问朝鲜诗录
    陈毅周恩来总理访问上阳村。一位农民老太太拉着周总理的
  手，很激动地说：
  “我的儿子是朝鲜劳动党的支部
  书记。他在村里坚持反抗美国侵略，他被美国人杀了！我一家人都死在美军炮火之中。感谢志愿军从烈火中把我救出。不然的话，我怎能活到今天？”“志愿军是我的恩人，他对我有救命的恩情。我争取多活几年，我今年已六十有零。我要努力建设自己的祖国，来报答志愿军的恩情。我永远忘不了美国军队毁灭我一家满门。”金日成首相接着说：“翻译同志，快来翻译，老太太的话，很有意思，你快翻给周总理听。”金首相听了翻译的话，又用流利的汉语作了更准确的订正。然后金首相补充说：“老太太的话，代表了，也表达了，朝鲜人民对中国人民的感情。”周总理拉着老太太的手，向她说：
  “您说的话很好！我非常感谢您！
  “若说恩情，朝中两国互有恩情。因为我们援助了你们，而你们也保卫了我们。
  “若说感谢，朝中两国人民都应该感谢人民军与志愿军。他们并肩作战，共同保卫了两国人民的安宁！
  “老太太，老同志，祝您身体健康！祝您为祖国服务的伟大志愿，能够顺利的完成！”我是中国代表团的一个成员，我本来不是一个诗人。但今天看见中国总理与朝鲜首相之间站着一位妇女农民。他们三个人的对话真是动人，真是充满了感情！这是一首真实而美妙的诗篇。它感染了我，使我这个不会吟诗的也要吟。我很朴实地记下他们的言辞。我非常激动地想着：朝中友谊真是鲜血凝成！这位老太太就是见证人。还有朝鲜义士朴在根同志，他用他的身子复盖一个志愿军的
  伤员，他死于飞弹之下而救活了这个志
  愿军。他就是志愿军的恩人，谁能忘记这样的恩情。你想，没有人民的支援，要打败侵略者怎么可能！记住！记住！朝中的友谊真是鲜血凝成！这样的团结曾经打败来攻的敌
  人。我要作一个诗人为这伟大的共产主义的友谊永远歌吟！
