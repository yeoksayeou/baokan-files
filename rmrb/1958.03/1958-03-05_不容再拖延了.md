    No Further Delay Allowed
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    Almost three months have passed since the Soviet Union proposed holding a summit conference of Eastern and Western countries. During this period, although Western countries, including the United States, Britain, and France, have agreed in principle to convene a summit conference, they insist on preparing for the meeting through diplomatic channels and holding a foreign ministers' conference. This attitude of the Western countries has made the question of how to prepare a major obstacle to convening the summit conference.
    In this situation, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko recently replied to French Foreign Minister Pineau's letter, expressing his agreement to continue negotiations through diplomatic channels while convening a foreign ministers' conference in the near future to prepare the agenda for the summit conference and determine the members of the conference. This action by the Soviet Union has removed the Western countries' excuse for delaying the summit conference and demonstrated the Soviet Union's sincere desire to promote the highest-level meeting.
    In his letter, Gromyko believes that a reliable agreement should be reached on the timing of the summit conference before the foreign ministers' conference is held. This request is quite reasonable. Because only in this way is the convening of the foreign ministers' conference necessary; otherwise, the foreign ministers' conference itself may become a means for some countries to delay the summit conference. The people of all countries and broad public opinion expect the summit conference to be held as soon as possible. If the countries concerned can first reach a definite agreement on the date of the conference, this will also be a major encouragement to the peace aspirations of the people of all countries.
    On the issue of the membership of the foreign ministers' conference, the Soviet Union advocates that it should be determined on the basis of parity between Eastern and Western countries. Among Western countries, France has already agreed to this. Since the conference to be convened is a meeting between Eastern and Western countries, the membership of the conference should, of course, adopt the principle of parity between Eastern and Western countries.
    Of course, there will still be disputes between Eastern and Western countries on the agenda of the summit conference. However, as long as an agreement is reached on the date of the summit conference, and everyone adopts a phased approach to solving international problems, first solving the easy-to-solve problems, then the agenda dispute is not difficult to resolve.
    The question now is that Western countries should express their attitude on the issue of holding the summit conference. No further delay is allowed on this issue.

    不容再拖延了
    本报评论员
    自从苏联提出举行东西方国家政府首脑会议的建议以来，三个月的时间快过去了。在这个期间，尽管包括美、英、法在内的西方国家都在原则上同意召开政府首脑会议，但是它们却坚持要通过外交途径和举行外长会议来为会议作准备。西方国家的这种态度，使得如何准备的问题成为召开政府首脑会议的一个主要障碍了。
    在这种情况下，苏联外长葛罗米柯最近在答复法国外长比诺的信中，表示同意一面继续通过外交途径进行谈判，一面在最近召开外长会议来准备政府首脑会议的议程和确定会议的成员。苏联的这个行动，解除了西方国家拖延召开政府首脑会议的借口，并表现了苏联促进最高级会议的真诚愿望。
    葛罗米柯在信中认为，在外长会议召开以前，要就召开政府首脑会议的时间达成可靠的协议。这个要求是十分合情合理的。因为，只有这样，外长会议的召开才是有必要的；否则，外长会议本身也可能成为一些国家拖延政府首脑会议的手段。各国人民和广泛的舆论都期望政府首脑会议能够早日举行。有关国家如能首先就召开会议的日期达成肯定的协议，这对于各国人民的和平愿望也是一个重大的鼓舞。
    苏联对外长会议的成员问题，主张应在东西方国家对等的基础上确定。在西方国家中，法国已经同意了这一点。既然要召开的是一个东西方国家之间的会议，那么，会议的成员当然应该采取东西方国家对等的原则。
    当然，在政府首脑会议的议程问题上，东西方国家之间还会有争论的。但是，只要对召开政府首脑会议的日期达成协议，并且大家对解决国际问题都采取分阶段的、首先解决容易解决的问题的态度，那末，议程的争论是不难解决的。
    现在的问题是西方国家应当在举行政府首脑会议的日期问题上表明它们的态度了。在这个问题上不容再拖延了。
