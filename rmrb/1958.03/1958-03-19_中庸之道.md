    “The Doctrine of the Mean”
    “The Doctrine of the Mean” is a famous book in China's "Four Books" (the other three are the Analects, Mencius, and the Great Learning), written by Zisi, the grandson of Confucius. This book explains the moral concept of the Doctrine of the Mean: not deviating is called Zhong (中), not changing is called Yong (庸). Therefore, the most proper morality is called the Doctrine of the Mean. The so-called Doctrine of the Mean, in today's language, can be explained as a morality that only seeks to preserve and does not seek innovation. It is a philosophy of life promoted by the feudal ruling class to maintain its own rule.

    “中庸之道”
    “中庸”是我国著名的“四书”中的一本书（其余三本是论语、孟子、大学），是孔子的孙子子思所著。这本书解释中庸这种道德说：不偏之谓中，不易之谓庸。故道德之最正当者谓之中庸。所谓中庸之道用现在的话来解释就是只求保守不求革新的道德，是封建统治阶级为了维持自己的统治而宣扬的一种人生哲学。
