Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 11th - Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province has adopted various measures to solve the labor force problems encountered in the great leap forward of local industry.

The autonomous prefecture will build and expand 253 local factories and mines this year. Seventy-two are currently being planned. According to the plan, the newly built and expanded factories and mines this year require a total of 10,200 laborers. However, the countryside is currently busy with agricultural capital construction and agricultural production, and it is impossible to draw labor from the countryside. The original local industries also need to expand production, and some even need to increase the labor force. Under the condition that the labor force is very tight in all aspects, the autonomous prefecture has taken the following three measures for larger factories and mines: First, some of the cadres sent to lower levels are sent to these factories and mines; second, the staff of the joint state-private shops in the cities and towns are streamlined; third, enterprises and personnel are adjusted. For example, the autonomous prefecture has both a construction company and a construction engineering team. After adjustment, the construction engineering team was abolished, and more than 500 people from this team were transferred to support the newly built factories and mines. The small factories and mines in various counties, which have a large demand for labor, mainly adopted the following measures: First, small and seasonal factories and mines are combined with agricultural cooperatives. Through contracts, combined with rural sideline production or utilizing slack farming seasons, the agricultural cooperatives draw a certain number of laborers to participate in the production of factories and mines, and the factories and mines give a certain amount of remuneration. Second, taking advantage of the slack season for urban commerce, contracts are signed with stores to transfer some employees to participate in local factory and mine production. Third, using the holidays and after-school time of middle and primary school students in various places, certain production projects and processes with lighter physical labor, such as raw material processing, are contracted to students, and a certain amount of remuneration is paid. In addition, some idle people in the cities and towns are also absorbed to participate in labor.

Due to the adoption of the above measures, the entire autonomous prefecture can obtain more than 9,700 laborers, which basically solves the labor force problem required for the newly built and expanded factories and mines this year.

    地方工业大发展　劳动力不够怎么办？
    云南大理白族自治州的办法又多又好
    新华社昆明11日电　云南省大理白族自治州采取各种措施解决了地方工业大跃进中遇到的劳动力问题。
    自治州今年将新建、扩建二百五十三个地方厂矿。正在着手筹建的有七十二个。根据规划，今年新建、扩建的厂矿共需一万零二百多个劳动力。但是现在农村正忙于农业基本建设和农业生产，不可能从农村抽调劳动力。原有的地方工业也要扩大生产，有的还需增加劳动力。在各方面劳动力都很紧张的情况下，自治州对规模较大的厂矿采取了下面三个措施：一、将下放干部中的一部分人下放到这些厂矿；二、精减城镇中公私合营商店的职工；三、调整企业单位和人员。例如自治州有建筑公司又有建筑工程队。经过调整，撤销了建筑工程队，把这个队的五百多人调去支援新建的厂矿。劳动力需要量很大的各县小型厂矿，主要采取了以下措施：一、小型的和季节性的厂矿与农业社结合。通过合同，结合农村副业生产或利用农闲时间，由农业社抽出一定数量的劳动力参加厂矿生产，厂矿给予一定的报酬。二、利用城镇商业淡季，和商店订合同，抽调一部分职工参加当地厂矿生产。三、利用各地中、小学学生的假期和课余时间，把体力劳动较轻的如原料加工等某些生产项目和工序包给学生去做，并付给一定报酬。另外，还吸收城镇一部分闲人来参加劳动。
    由于采取上述各项措施，全自治州总共可以获得九千七百多个劳动力，基本解决了今年新建、扩建厂矿所需的劳动力问题。
