    Silver from Clay
    ——The Story of Aluminum
    Mi Yang
    In the 1820s, at a grand banquet in England, a duchess's attire attracted great attention from the female guests. She wore neither ruby earrings nor priceless diamond rings; all her ornaments were made of a metal resembling tin and silver. The duchess also proudly took off her bracelet and declared that these precious ornaments had cost her one hundred and twenty pounds from a French merchant. It was as light as a piece of paper. Even the duchess herself did not know what this metal was. So, the nobles frantically spent exorbitant prices to search for this metal. Later, the whole story was finally known:
    In 1825 and 1827, two French chemists separately produced metallic aluminum by reacting a mixture of potassium and mercury and pure potassium with aluminum chloride. Before this, although metallic aluminum had not yet been born, it had already been named. The Latin word for aluminum means "the metal of alum," because alum was the most familiar aluminum compound to people at that time. Later, when people learned that clay is mainly composed of aluminum compounds, the name "silver from clay" became popular.
    Refining silver from clay became a craze. Soon, a chemist named Deville successfully tested a method for refining aluminum on a larger scale. As a result, the price of aluminum plummeted, and many merchants went bankrupt. Later, the method of refining aluminum by electricity was invented, and the price of aluminum dropped even further. At that time, one pound could buy more than ten kilograms of aluminum.
    In this way, people's understanding of the properties of aluminum became more thorough. Because it is very light, people use it to manufacture airplane bodies. Before this, it was only known to use wood and silk to make airplane bodies. "All-metal aircraft" became the most fashionable name at that time. Later, in order to increase the mechanical properties of aluminum, aluminum alloys were used instead of pure aluminum. One of the most commonly used "duralumin" in the aircraft industry is made by adding about 4% copper and a small amount of magnesium, manganese, iron, and silicon to aluminum. Its performance is almost the same as steel. In addition to the aviation industry, people also want to use it in other transportation sectors. For example, the manufacture of train carriages is of great significance. At present, the weight of freight car skins alone accounts for one-third of the total weight when fully loaded, while passenger car carriages account for more than 95% of the total weight. If the car bodies can be replaced with aluminum, the efficiency of the locomotive traction can be increased by at least one time on average.
    Aluminum is not only light, but its electrical and thermal conductivity is also very strong, second only to copper. At present, aluminum has a tendency to replace copper in the manufacture of electric wires, because it can greatly reduce the weight of electrical appliances.
    The chemical properties of aluminum are very active, but because a dense aluminum oxide film is often formed on the surface, protecting it like a layer of paint, it becomes stable. Therefore, we can use aluminum to make various daily utensils. However, powdered aluminum is not so stable. As long as it is heated with fire, it will burn in the air. Aluminum has an extraordinarily strong ability to combine with oxygen, so that it can take oxygen from other metal oxides. Using this principle, aluminum has become an excellent reducing agent in the metallurgical industry, especially in the smelting industry of rare metals, and is used to reduce other difficult-to-smelt metals.
    People believe that the most precious gemstones are nothing more than naturally produced transparent aluminum oxide crystals. Those containing some chromium are rubies, and those containing some titanium are sapphires. Now people melt aluminum oxide with electricity, and then mix in some corresponding impurities to make various colored gemstones, which are even better than natural gemstones. So gemstones have become worthless again. You know, not long ago, the best rubies were more expensive than diamonds.
    Aluminum oxide containing more impurities and being opaque is usually not called gemstone but corundum. Fine powder of corundum is called emery, because of its great hardness, it is often used to make sandpaper and grinding wheels to grind steel tools. The grinding wheel used to sharpen ice skates in winter is made of emery.
    The entire earth's crust is almost entirely composed of aluminum compounds - aluminum silicates. However, at present, only a few minerals such as bauxite (hydrated aluminum oxide) and cryolite (sodium aluminum fluoride) have refining value. If the aluminum in aluminum silicate can also be utilized, and the refining cost is reduced, it will definitely replace steel in the future.
    Our country is a country with extremely rich aluminum ore. According to the reserves explored in the first five-year plan alone, it greatly exceeds the United States, second only to the Soviet Union and ranking second in the world. During the first five-year plan, the modern aluminum smelting industry was also established on a large scale, and has already supplied its own jet aircraft and civil aircraft manufacturing industry. The hard fen coins currently circulating on the market are also rolled from aluminum produced by our own country. By 1962, our aluminum smelting industry will increase six to eight times on the existing basis. At that time, the "silver from clay" will create even greater miracles in our socialist construction.

    粘土中的白银
    ——铝的故事
    米扬
    十九世纪二十年代，在英国的一次盛大的宴会上，一位公爵夫人的打扮引起了赴宴的女客们极大的注意，她既没有佩上红宝石的耳坠，也没有带价值连城的钻戒，全部的饰物都是像锡又像银的金属做成的。公爵夫人还骄傲地从臂上脱下手镯并宣称她这些珍贵的饰物是花了一百二十金镑从一个法国商人那儿买来的。它轻得简直像张纸一样。连公爵夫人自己也不知道这种金属到底是什么东西。于是，贵族们发狂般的花了极高的代价去搜购这种金属。后来终于知道了这件事的始末：
    公元1825年和1827年有两个法国化学家分别用钾和水银的混合物和纯钾同氯化铝作用而制出了金属的铝。在这以前虽然金属状态的铝还没有出世，可是它却早已被命名了。拉丁文的铝字，即“明矾的金属”的意思。因为明矾是当时人们最熟知的铝的化合物的原故。后来当人们了解到粘土主要是由铝的化合物所构成时，便流传了这样的一个名称——粘土中的白银。
    提炼粘土中的白银形成了一个热潮，不久有个叫戴维勒的化学家试验成功了一种较大规模地提炼铝的方法，于是铝的价格惨跌了，不少商人因此破了产。后来用电来炼铝的方法发明了，铝的价格更加降低，那时一个金镑就已经能买到十几公斤的铝。
    这样，铝的性质被人们了解得更加透彻了。由于它很轻，人们便用它来制造飞机的机身，在此以前是只知道用木头和绸子来做飞机机身的。“全金属飞机”当时成了一个最时髦的名称。后来为了增加铝的机械性能，就不用纯铝而改用铝的合金。飞机工业中最常用的一种“耐铝”就是在铝中加入约4％的铜和少量的镁，锰，铁和硅做成的，它的性能几乎和钢差不多。除了航空工业以外，人们也想把它用到其他运输部门中去。譬如火车车厢的制造就具有很大意义，目前光是货车车皮的重量就达到满载货物时总重量的三分之一，而客车车厢却占到总重量95％以上，如果能把车身都换成铝制，那么火车头牵引的效率平均至少可提高一倍以上。
    铝不但质轻，它的导电、导热的本领也非常强，仅次于铜。目前铝已有代替铜来制造电线的趋势，因为它能大大减轻电器重量。
    铝的化学性质非常活泼，可是因为在表面上常生成一种细密的氧化铝薄膜像上了一层漆一样的保护了它，使得它变得稳定起来。因此我们就可以利用铝制成各样的日常用具。不过细末状的铝可就不那么稳定了，只要用火加热它就会在空气中烧起来。铝和氧气化合的本领异常强，以致能把别的金属氧化物中的氧夺出来，利用这个原理，铝就成了冶金工业中特别是稀有金属的冶炼工业中的一个优良的还原剂，用来把其他难于冶炼的金属还原出来。
    人们认为最贵重的宝石不过是天然产出的透明的氧化铝结晶而已，含有一些铬的是红宝石，含有一些钛的就是蓝宝石。现在人们用电将氧化铝熔化，再混入些相应的杂质就可制成各色的宝石，并且比天然的宝石还要好。于是宝石又变得不值钱了。要知道不久以前最好的红宝石比金钢钻还要贵哩。
    那些杂质含得较多并且不透明的氧化铝，通常不叫宝石而叫钢玉，钢玉的细粉称为金钢砂，因为它的硬度很大，常用来制造砂纸砂轮，来磨钢铁的器具。冬天用来磨冰刀的砂轮就是用金钢砂压制成的。
    整个地壳几乎全是由铝的化合物——铝硅酸盐构成的，不过目前有提炼价值的只有铝矾土（氧化铝的水化物）、冰晶石（铝氟化钠）等少数几个矿物。如果铝硅酸盐中的铝也能利用，再加上提炼成本的降低，将来它一定会取钢铁而代之。
    我国是个铝矿极丰富的国家，仅根据第一个五年计划中探明的储量就大大超过美国，次于苏联而居世界第二位。第一个五年计划期间，近代化炼铝工业也大量的建立起来，并且已经供应自己的喷气飞机和民航飞机制造工业。目前市面流通的硬分币也是由我国自己生产的铝轧制的。到了1962年我们的炼铝工业将在现有基础上再提高六到八倍，那时，“粘土中的白银”将会在我们建设社会主义的事业中创造更大的奇迹。
