    Tears of Woe from Taiwanese Women

    The Road is Littered with Frozen Corpses, Half of Them Women and Infants
    Around the Spring Festival, cold waves assaulted Taipei several times. In Taiwanese newspapers, headlines like "Someone froze to death!" "The sound of wind and rain at night, who knows how many have frozen to death?" "Driven by hunger and cold, a woman abandoned her child and committed suicide" frequently appear.

    The ranks of the poor and beggars in Taiwan are expanding year by year. Millions of people cannot get enough to eat or wear. In Taipei, in Keelung, every night a cold wave hits, the next morning hundreds of frozen corpses are scattered on the streets.

    According to Taiwanese newspapers, more than half of those who freeze to death on the streets of Taiwan's towns and cities are women and children.

    Taiwanese newspapers revealed a heartbreaking scene of a cold night in Taipei. On the evening of February 12, the temperature in Taipei was 2.6 degrees Celsius, which is very cold weather for Taipei. That night, from the US military's 63 Club on Yuanshan Zhonglie Road, from the US military officers' club on Section 3 of Zhongshan North Road, from the US 13th Air Force Club on Section 4 of Roosevelt Road, disgusting jazz music and the sounds of crazy A-Fei dances and swing music were heard. On the roads, the wind and rain were bleak, and there were few pedestrians. Under the dim streetlights, people could see newly frozen corpses and dying beggars shivering and groaning in the streets and alleys.

    Not far from the Grand Hotel Yuanshan, a beggar child of two or three years old was wailing on the side of the road, shaking his mother's cold, stiff body, trying to wake her up. Three drunk American soldiers came out of the Grand Hotel Yuanshan, waving their wine bottles and humming vulgar songs, staggering along the way. They heard the orphan's cries and approached. One American soldier kicked the child hard, and another American soldier inhumanely tore open the tattered clothes of the newly frozen young beggar woman. Then, they roared and grinned as they left.

    Driven by Hunger and Cold, a Young Woman Commits Theft and is Sentenced
    Taiwanese female intellectuals also generally live in misery. Recently, Taiwanese newspapers published a social news story with the headline: "Driven by Hunger and Cold, a Beauty Regrets Becoming a Thief. Supporting Her Mother and Younger Brother is Too Difficult, She Weeps and Tells of Her Life After Being Arrested for Theft." The news said that a young woman named Zhang, 21 years old, is a student in the night school of Taiwan Normal University. Because her whole family was suffering from hunger and cold, she stole for the first time and was taken to jail by the police.

    This young woman named Zhang lives in Taoyuan County and works as a proofreader in a bookstore in Taoyuan, using her meager salary to support her elderly mother and young brother. For several years, the family has lived on thin porridge and sweet potato porridge for most of the time. However, she did not lose heart because of the hardships of life, and always strived for progress. She originally only had a junior high school education, but after several years of diligent self-study, she finally entered the night school of Taiwan Normal University last summer vacation and her academic performance is very good. She works as a proofreader in a bookstore in Taoyuan during the day and takes a long-distance bus from Taoyuan to Taipei City for classes at night. Often, she is sitting on the bus today and has to raise money for tomorrow's fare. Especially recently, with the soaring prices in Taiwan, her salary at the bookstore has not increased, which makes her economic situation extremely difficult.

    After class on the evening of the 2nd, she not only had no money for the bus fare to return home to Taoyuan from Taipei, but also had no money for the whole family to eat porridge and sweet potatoes the next day. Therefore, she wandered near the girls' dormitory, and after a serious ideological struggle, she finally embarked on the road of theft. This was her first time stealing, and she took some money from a classmate in the dormitory. When she left the school gate, she was extremely frightened and flustered, which aroused the suspicion of the gate guard, who took her to the police station and was sentenced to jail by the Taiwanese "District Court."

    This is just an ordinary example. In Taiwan, this kind of tragedy among female intellectuals happens frequently. Not long ago, a female elementary school teacher in Tainan, whose husband was unemployed and whose young child was critically ill and had no money to buy medicine, tried to steal a bottle of medicine from a pharmacy and was arrested and sent to jail on the spot, and the child also died because he could not get medical treatment. As for the tragic events of Taiwanese female intellectuals being forced to commit suicide due to unemployment, poverty, mental distress, lack of freedom in marriage, or being humiliated by American soldiers, they happen often.

    台湾妇女的辛酸泪
    文：古凡　插图：华君武
    路有冻死骨　半数是妇婴
    春节前后，寒流好几回侵袭台北。在台湾的报纸上，常常出现“冻死人了！”“夜来风雨声，冻死知多少？”“饥寒交迫，妇人弃子自杀”等新闻标题。
    台湾的贫民和乞丐的队伍一年比一年扩大。数以百万计的人民吃不饱，穿不暖。在台北，在基隆，每一个寒流侵袭的夜晚，第二天清晨都有成百具冻毙了的人尸散处街头。
    据台湾报纸透露，在台湾各市镇街头冻毙的人们中，有半数以上是妇女和儿童。
    台湾报纸透露了台北市一个令人心酸的寒夜景象。2月12日晚，台北市内的温度是摄氏二点六度，这在台北是很冷的天气了。这天晚上，从台北圆山忠烈路美军六三俱乐部，从中山北路三段美军军官俱乐部，从罗斯福路四段美军十三航空队俱乐部，都传出了肉麻的爵士乐声和癫狂的阿飞舞、摇摆舞曲的音响。马路上，凄风苦雨，行人稀少。在暗弱的路灯照射下，人们在街头巷尾可以看到刚冻死的人尸，垂死的乞丐们在瑟缩呻吟。
    离圆山大饭店不远处的马路边，一个两三岁大的丐童在嚎哭，摇撼着他的妈妈冰冷僵硬的身体，想她苏醒过来。三个喝醉了的美国军人从圆山大饭店出来，一路挥舞着酒瓶，嘴里哼着下流的歌曲，东歪西倒地走着。他们听到那孤儿的惨哭声，走近前去。一个美军猛力地踢了那孩子一脚，另一个美军丧失人性地扯开了刚冻死的青年丐妇身上的破烂衣服。然后，他们一路呼啸着、狞笑着离去。
    饥寒起盗心　少女被判刑
    台湾的妇女知识分子，也普遍地生活在悲惨中。最近台湾报纸登载了一件社会新闻，标题是：“饥寒起盗心，佳人悔作贼。奉养母弟生活太艰辛，行窃被捕血泪诉身世”。消息说，有一个姓张的少女，今年二十一岁，是台湾师范大学夜间部的学生。她因全家饥寒交迫，第一次偷东西，被警察局拉去坐牢。
    这个姓张的少女家住桃园县，在桃园一家书店里做校对，用微薄的薪水供养年老的母亲和年幼的弟弟。几年来，全家大半日子都吃稀饭和蕃薯粥过活。但是，她没有因为生活的煎熬而垂头丧气，仍然始终力谋上进。她本来只有初中的程度，经过几年的勤奋自修，终于在去年暑假考进了台湾师范大学夜间部，学习的成绩很好。她白天在桃园书店做校对，晚上从桃园乘长途汽车到台北市上课。往往今天坐在车上，又要筹措明天的车费。尤其是近来台湾物价飞涨，她在书店任职的薪水却没有增加，更使她在经济上极端困难。
    2日晚上下课后，她不但从台北返桃园家中的车费没有着落，而且第二天全家吃稀饭、蕃薯的钱都没有着落。因此，她徘徊在女生宿舍附近，经过了严重的思想斗争，最后走上了偷窃的道路。这是她的第一次偷盗，进宿舍拿了同学的一点钱，出校门时因惊惧万分，慌张失措，引起门警怀疑，把她捉到警察局去，被台湾的“地方法院”判处坐牢。
    这不过是一个普通的事例。在台湾，女知识分子中的这一类悲剧，是经常发生的。不久以前，台南有一个小学女教师，丈夫失业，幼儿病危没有钱买药，她到药房想偷一瓶药品，当场被捕去坐牢，幼儿也因得不到医疗而死去。至于台湾女知识青年因失业贫困、精神苦闷、婚姻不自由或受到美军的凌辱而被迫自杀的惨事，更是常常发生。
