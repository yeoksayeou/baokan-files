    Conservatism Should Be Criticized
    Blind Optimism Is Also Not Good
    Jiangxi
    (By our correspondent) This newspaper reports that during the general inspection of spring plowing preparations in various parts of Jiangxi, it was learned that among cadres above the production team leader level in Nanchang County, 75% expressed confidence and determination in completing the increased production plan targets, but 20% echoed the plan without really believing it, expressing doubts that the increased production plan could be realized; 5% had resistant emotions. From the perspective of the county's farmers, 65% had confidence and determination to complete the plan targets, 25% echoed without truly believing it, with doubts; 10% had resistant emotions. At the same time, complacency was also found among cadres and the masses. Nanchang County is taking remedial actions in response to the ideological problems exposed during the spring plowing inspection. During the inspection, various places generally emphasized that the current time is the most critical moment for spring plowing preparations, criticizing the erroneous idea that "spring plowing preparations are already coming to an end." They emphasized making persistent efforts, exerting the last bit of strength, and doing a good job in spring plowing preparations. (Zhou Qingyang)

    江西
    本报讯　江西各地的备耕工作大检查中了解到，南昌县生产队长以上的干部对增产计划指标表现有信心、有决心完成增产计划的占干部总数的75％，但对计划随声附和，表示有怀疑，恐怕增产计划不能实现的占20％；有抵触情绪的占5％。从全县的农民群众来看，对计划指标有信心、有决心完成的占65％，随声附和有怀疑的占25％；有抵触情绪的占10％。同时，在干部和群众中也发现有自满情绪。南昌县针对备耕检查中暴露出来的思想问题，正在采取补课。在检查中，各地普遍强调当前是备耕工作的最紧要的时机，批判了那种认为“备耕工作已经是尾声”了的错误思想。强调再接再厉，努最后的一把力，搞好备耕工作。　（周庆扬）
