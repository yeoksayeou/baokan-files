Tianjin, March 4th. Tianjin's million workers, filled with unparalleled revolutionary enthusiasm, are fiercely attacking waste and conservatism in all aspects with the force of a thunderbolt.

    At the beginning of the movement, leading cadres of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and district committees broke with convention and went deep into grassroots units to hold on-site meetings. They used methods such as organizing visits and comparisons, and having the advanced lead the backward, to promote the rapid development of the movement. In the movement, leading cadres broke away from the past working methods of first inside the Party then outside the Party, first cadres then masses, and launching layer by layer. They adopted the method of going straight to the bottom, meeting directly with the masses. Many leading cadres took the lead in posting big-character posters and participating in the workers' airing of views meetings, using exposures of the waste caused by their own bureaucratism, lethargy, and extravagance to unleash the masses, swiftly burn, fiercely burn, and greatly burn. Technical personnel and management personnel also actively participated. They abandoned face-saving and, together with the workers, boldly exposed problems. Some technical personnel even went to workshops to solicit opinions from the masses. The broad masses of workers checked plans, checked systems, checked contracts, and checked warehouses, collecting materials everywhere for exposure, setting off a revolutionary competition of comparing big-character posters, comparing depth, and comparing drive. Workers in many factories also gathered the collected physical objects, drew their own diagrams, and wrote explanations, holding various forms of exhibitions at the workshop warehouses and other sites. Visitors discussed, inspired, and promoted each other.

    As a result of fully mobilizing the masses, waste and conservatism in all aspects have been searched out one by one. In the more than two thousand big-character posters posted by workers at the Tianjin Enamel Factory, waste was exposed in every link from raw material procurement to finished product output. The losses caused by accumulated waste in the past year alone were equivalent to half of the factory's total assets. Workers at the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Materials Company exposed that due to poor storage, commodity mildew and deterioration, and lax acceptance inspection, the waste loss amounted to more than 2 million yuan. Workers in factories and enterprises have made powerful exposures of the bureaucratism, subjectivism, failure to rely on the masses, failure to cherish state property, and departmentalism of leading cadres, technical personnel, and management personnel. Staff in cultural and educational institutions and other units focused their firepower on various backward phenomena such as following old ways, being lethargic, and being arrogant and complacent.

    The serious waste phenomena exposed have greatly surprised leading cadres in many units. Leading cadres in some units that are at the forefront of the movement promptly analyzed the situation, found the ideological roots, and calculated economic accounts as well as ideological accounts. They also publicly made self-criticisms to the workers. The broad masses of workers were inspired with a strong sense of ownership and actively sought ways to plug loopholes, turning waste into savings, and turning backwardness into advancement. Many workers automatically established labor covenants. The unhealthy trends of being late and leaving early, and not being mentally focused at work, were swept away. A new atmosphere of diligence and thrift, loving the factory as one's home is taking shape.

    Currently, the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in Tianjin is continuing to develop in depth. The development of the movement is still uneven, with some units, especially government organizations, lagging behind. Some units have failed to break with convention and their actions are still very slow. These units are in a situation where leaders are urging, the masses are pushing, there is attack from both above and below, and the situation is pressing. They are required to catch up quickly.

    天津百万职工群众革命热情澎湃
    快烧猛烧大烧浪费保守
    本报天津4日电　天津市百万职工怀着无比的革命热情，以雷霆万钧之势，猛烈冲击着各方面的浪费、保守现象。
    运动一开始，中共市委和区委的领导干部打破常规，纷纷深入基层单位，召开现场会议，以组织参观、评比，先进带动落后的办法，促进运动的迅速发展。各级领导干部在运动中打破了过去先党内后党外，先干部后群众，层层发动的工作方法，采取一竿子插到底的办法，直接同群众见面。许多领导干部带头贴大字报，参加职工的鸣放会，用揭发自己的官气、暮气和阔气所造成的浪费事实，放手发动群众，快烧、猛烧、大烧。技术人员、管理人员也积极起来，他们打破了面子，和职工一道，大胆揭发，有些技术人员还到车间征求群众对自己的意见。广大工人群众查计划、查制度、查合同、查仓库，到处搜集材料，进行揭发，掀起了比大字报、比深透、比干劲的革命竞赛。许多工厂的职工还把搜集的实物集中起来，自己画图表、写说明，在车间仓库等现场举办各种形式展览会，这种展览会现在已有三百六十七个，参观者互相议论、互相启发、互相促进。
    充分发动群众的结果，各个方面的浪费、保守现象都一一被搜索出来。天津市搪瓷厂职工贴出的两千多张大字报中，揭发了从原料采购到成品出厂各个环节上的浪费，仅去年1年积压浪费造成的损失，就相当于工厂全部资产的一半。天津市药材公司职工揭发由于保管不善，商品霉坏变质、验收不严等原因，浪费损失二百多万元。工厂企业中的职工对于领导干部、技术人员和管理人员的官僚主义、主观主义、不依靠群众、不爱护国家财产和本位主义思想，都作了有力的揭露。文化教育机关等单位的工作人员，集中火力对各种因循守旧、暮气沉沉、骄傲自大等落后现象发起了攻击。
    揭发出来的严重浪费现象，使许多单位的领导干部大吃一惊。一些走在运动前面的单位的领导干部，及时分析、找出思想根源，算了经济账，也算了思想账，并公开向职工检查。广大职工激发了强烈的主人翁责任感，积极设法堵塞漏洞，变浪费为节约，变落后为先进。许多工人自动建立了劳动公约，过去迟到早退、工作时精神不集中等违反劳动纪律的邪气一扫而光。勤俭节约、爱厂如家的新风气正在形成。
    目前天津市反浪费反保守运动正在继续向纵深发展。运动的发展，还不平衡，部分单位特别是机关较差，有些单位未能打破常规，行动仍很迟缓。这些单位正处在领导督促、群众推动、上下夹攻、形势逼人的情况下，要求他们迅速赶上去。
