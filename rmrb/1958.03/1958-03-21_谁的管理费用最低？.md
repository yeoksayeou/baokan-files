    Who has the lowest management costs?
    The level of enterprise management costs is one of the indicators of how well the policy of diligence and thrift in running enterprises is implemented. Among the enterprises under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the administrative management costs consumed by each technical personnel and staff member (excluding wages and depreciation) differ by a factor of 6.7 between the highest and lowest.
  (See chart above) The Jiapigou Mine and the Furong Mine are in the same area, but the administrative management costs of the former are more than four times higher than those of the latter.
    Why are the management costs of Fushun Steel Plant, Factory 101, and Jiapigou Mine so high? Because they exhibit bureaucratic airs and extravagance, resulting in significant waste. For example, Factory 101 purchased many expensive flowers to beautify the environment, including camellias costing sixty yuan per pot and flowering peach trees costing fifteen yuan per pot. The average administrative management cost consumed by each technical personnel and staff member at Fushun Steel Plant was seventy-seven yuan the year before last, but it increased to one hundred and thirty-two yuan last year, indicating significant extravagance and waste.
    According to the calculations of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the average monthly administrative management cost consumed by all technical and staff personnel is forty yuan, which is much higher than that of the Furong Mine. They calculated that a 40% reduction, bringing it down to twenty-four yuan, is entirely possible. This would save the country six million yuan annually.

### 谁的管理费用最低？

    谁的管理费用最低？
    企业管理费用的高低，是勤俭办企业方针执行得好坏的标志之一。在冶金工业部所属企业中，从每个技术人员和职员所消耗的行政管理费用来看（不包括工资、折旧），最高的和最低的相差六点七倍。
  （见上图表）夹皮沟矿和芙蓉矿在一个地区，但前者的行政管理费比后者高四倍多。
    为什么抚顺钢厂、一○一厂和夹皮沟矿的管理费用会这样高呢？因为它们存在着官气和阔气，浪费很大。如一○一厂，为了美化环境，买了许多贵重花卉。有六十元一盆的茶花，还有十五元一盆的柳桃花。抚顺钢厂前年平均每个技术人员和职员消耗的行政管理费是七十七元，去年就增加到一百三十二元，显然其中有许多铺张浪费。
    据冶金工业部计算，全部平均技职人员每月消耗的行政管理费为四十元，比芙蓉矿高得多。他们计算，要降低40％，即降到二十四元，是完全可能的。这样，全年就可以为国家节省六百万元。
