　This Dispatch from Guangzhou, March 28th: Guangdong Province's relevant departments have recently adopted measures to vigorously utilize sugarcane by-products, which possess significant economic value. The relevant departments have decided to refit the existing sugar mills' boilers, using coal to replace bagasse as fuel, in order to utilize bagasse for papermaking. The newly built Jiangmen Pulp Mill will use the bagasse from the state-owned Beijie Sugar Mill, which crushes 3,000 tons of sugarcane per day, as raw material, and can produce more than 40,000 tons of pulp annually. In the past, only a few state-owned sugar mills had workshops attached for producing alcohol from waste molasses. Now, the relevant departments have decided to have all sugar mills with a daily crushing capacity of more than 1,000 tons of sugarcane add alcohol workshops. Sugarcane wax factories will also be set up near large sugar mills to extract sugarcane wax from sugarcane filter mud.

    广东广泛利用甘蔗副产品
    本报广州28日电　广东省有关部门最近采取措施，大力利用经济价值很大的甘蔗副产品。有关部门已经决定改装现有糖厂的锅炉，用煤炭来代替蔗渣作燃料，以便利用蔗渣造纸。新建的江门纸浆厂就将利用日榨甘蔗三千吨的国营北街糖厂的蔗渣作原料，可以年产纸浆四万多吨。过去仅少数国营糖厂附设有利用废糖蜜制酒精的车间，现在有关部门已经决定让所有日榨甘蔗一千吨以上的糖厂都增设酒精车间。还将在大糖厂附近设蔗腊厂，从甘蔗滤泥中提取蔗腊。
