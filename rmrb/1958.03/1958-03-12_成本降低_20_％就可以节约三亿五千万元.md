    A 20% Reduction in Costs Can Save 350 Million Yuan

    In the past, whenever savings were mentioned, some people believed that local construction enterprises were scattered, fragmented, with large expenditures, and without any profit to be made. The following comparison materials prove that it is not only possible for local construction enterprises to save costs, but there is also great potential for it. The Shanghai First Construction Company's task for this year is double that of 1957. They have proposed to reduce costs by 25%, achieve a first-class product quality rate of 98%, resolutely eliminate third-class products, resolutely eliminate deaths, serious injuries, and fire accidents, and reduce minor injuries by 50% compared to last year. Their profits turned over to the state should be four times higher than the actual profits turned over in 1957. Among the nearly forty local construction enterprises across the country, there is a huge gap between the advanced and the backward. Regarding the cost reduction target alone, the highest is 25%, and the lowest is only 9%. Some individual units have not even mobilized the masses to discuss how much they will reduce this year.

    Taking the Shanghai First Construction Company, which has relatively advanced indicators, for example, its first-class product rate and the daily output value of each worker are still lower than those of the Nanjing Construction Engineering Company. The labor input per unit area is also higher than that of the Nantong Construction Engineering Bureau and the Fushun First Construction Company. If the Shanghai First Construction Company makes more effort, then the cost will definitely be further reduced. As for the savings potential of other enterprises, it goes without saying. If all local construction enterprises can reduce costs by 20%, the country can save 350 million yuan in construction investment. With 350 million yuan, 14 million square meters of housing can be built (calculated at 25 yuan per square meter).

### 成本降低20％就可以节约三亿五千万元

    成本降低20％就可以节约三亿五千万元
    过去，一提到节约，就有人认为地方建筑企业分散，零星，花费大，没有油水。下面的对比材料证明，地方建筑企业节约成本不仅有可能，而且大有可为。上海市第一建筑公司今年的任务比1957年提高一倍，他们提出降低成本25％，工程质量一级品达到98％，坚决消灭三级品；坚决消灭死亡、重伤和火灾事故，轻伤也要比去年减少50％，上缴利润要比1957年实际上缴利润提高四倍。在全国将近四十个地方建筑企业中，先进和落后相差悬殊，仅降低成本一项指标，最高的是25％，最低的只有9％，还有个别单位连今年究竟降低多少还没有发动群众讨论。
    就以各项指标都比较先进的上海市第一建筑公司来说，它的一级品率和每个工人的日产值还低于南京市建筑工程公司，单位面积用工数也比南通市建筑工程局和抚顺市一公司多。如果上海市第一建筑公司再努一把力，那末，成本一定会再降低。至于其它企业的节约潜力，就更不必说了。如果所有地方建筑企业都能降低成本20％，全国就可以节约建筑投资三亿五千万元。用三亿五千万元可以兴建一千四百万平方公尺的住宅（每平方公尺以二十五元计算）。
