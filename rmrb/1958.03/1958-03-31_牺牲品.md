    Sacrifice
    The American "Wall Street Journal" recently reported that in these days, the political center of gravity in Washington has subtly shifted from Eisenhower to Nixon. The report also said that American Republicans now not only regard Nixon as the leader of the Republican Party, but also as the leader of the government.
    From this report, Eisenhower, who was once the darling of the American monopoly capital and Republican politicians, has now greatly depreciated in value; Nixon is now riding high.
    But why has Eisenhower fallen out of favor? According to the aforementioned report, American Republican congressmen, state party leaders, and even members of Eisenhower's cabinet are leaning towards Nixon because they have seen the Republican Party being threatened by the label of "depression party" again.
    It turns out that American monopoly capital and Republican politicians, under the pressure of a severe economic depression, are trying to use Eisenhower as a sacrifice to ease domestic class contradictions.
    From this, we can see that the fate of the American president, as an agent of monopoly capital, is also very sad.

    牺牲品
    美国“华尔街日报”最近报道说，这些天来，华盛顿的政治重心已经微妙地从艾森豪威尔转向尼克松。这个报道还说，美国共和党人现在不但把尼克松看作是共和党的领袖，而且还把他看作是政府的领袖。
    从这则报道看来，曾经一度成为美国大垄断资本和共和党政客们的宠儿的艾森豪威尔，现在是身价大跌了；尼克松则正在鸿运当头。
    但是，艾森豪威尔究竟为什么失宠了呢？据上述的报道说，美国共和党的议员、各州党领袖，甚至艾森豪威尔内阁的阁员由于看到了共和党又受到了“萧条党”的称号的威胁，正在倒向尼克松的一边。
    原来，美国大垄断资本和共和党政客们在严重的经济萧条的逼迫下，已在设法要把艾森豪威尔作为他们缓和国内阶级矛盾的牺牲品。
    由此可知，作为垄断资本的代理人的美国总统，其命运也是十分可哀的。
