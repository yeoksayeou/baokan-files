Huanjiang is implementing twelve tool reforms

    This newspaper reports: A magnificent and vigorous reform movement of agricultural tools and transportation tools is currently underway in Huanjiang County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The people's slogan is: modernize old-fashioned agricultural tools, and transform transportation tools into wheeled vehicles and pack animals.

    Huanjiang is a county primarily inhabited by the Zhuang and Maonan peoples, with the Zhuang people accounting for 75%. As of March 8th, the county had completed 97% of its plan to expand irrigation by more than 110,000 mu, and fertilizer accumulation had increased more than tenfold compared to last year. However, this area is mountainous, transportation is underdeveloped, and tools are very backward, with transportation relying on people carrying loads on their shoulders, which has brought great difficulties due to labor shortages.

    In order to rapidly change this backward situation, the Huanjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to implement twelve reforms of agricultural tools and transportation tools throughout the county: 1. Change foot plows and soil plows to double-wheel double-share plows, 53-step plows, and lightweight step plows for plowing fields; 2. Change manual soil crushing and soil rake crushing to soil crushing machines and "yangtao" (actinidia) rollers for crushing soil; 3. Change human carrying and back carrying to hand-pushed carts, cattle-pulled carts, horse-pulled carts, and human-pulled carts; 4. Change manual sowing to sowing machine sowing; 5. Change footpaths to cattle and horse cart roads, and change main field ridges to small roads; 6. Change small scrapers to large hoes; 7. Change small sickles for cutting grass and rice to large sickles for cutting grass and serrated sickles for cutting rice; 8. Change manual threshing and hand-cutting of rice to stone rollers and threshing machines for threshing; 9. Change manual cultivation to cultivator cultivation; 10. Change manual corn kernel removal to corn threshing machine kernel removal; 11. Change manual rice pounding to water mill rice milling; 12. Change knife cutting of pig feed to vine cutting machine cutting of pig feed. The county committee requires that by June of this year, every five oxen must have one oxcart, every horse must have one horse cart, every thirty mu of land must have one soil crushing harrow, and every thirty mu of field must have one harrowing machine. It requires that transportation in mountainous areas be wheeled within one month. The county's 108 townships have organized a total of more than 630 carpenters and ironworkers, and in the six days from March 2nd to 8th, they have produced 160 handcarts, 83 horse-drawn and ox-drawn carts, 6 soil crushing machines, and 4 "yangtao" rollers.

    In the manufacturing of wooden carts, all townships have implemented the spirit of diligence and frugality in running the cooperatives, using local materials, finding their own wood, providing their own labor, and processing their own iron nails, so the cost of a wooden cart is 30% lower than the purchase price.

### 改脚犁为双铧犁　变肩挑为手推  环江实行十二项工具改革

    改脚犁为双铧犁　变肩挑为手推
    环江实行十二项工具改革
    本报讯　一个波涛壮阔、声势浩大的农具、运输工具的改革运动，目前正在广西僮族自治区环江县开展着。人们的口号是：旧式农具新式化，运输工具车子化、马驮化。
    环江是一个以僮族和毛难族人民为主的县，其中僮族占75％。到3月8日止，全县水利扩灌十一万多亩的计划已完成了97％，积肥比去年增十多倍。但是这个地区多山，交通不发达，工具也很落后，运输靠人挑肩背，这样就给劳力不足带来了很大的困难。
    为了迅速改变这种落后状态，中共环江县委会决定在全县实行农具、运输工具十二项改革：一、改脚犁、土犁犁田为双轮双铧犁、53步犁、轻便步犁犁田；二、改人工碎土、土耙碎土为碎土机、洋桃磙碎土；三、改人挑、人背为人推车、牛拉、马拉、人拉车；四、改人工播种为播种机播种；五、改人行道为牛、马车道，改主要田基为小路；六、改小刮子为大锄头；七、改小镰刀割草割禾为大镰刀割草，锯齿镰割禾；八、改人打谷、手剪禾为石磙和打谷机打谷；九、改人工中耕为中耕器中耕；十、改人手脱玉米粒为玉米脱粒机脱粒；十一、改人舂米为水碾碾米；十二、改刀切猪菜为切蔓机切猪菜。县委要求全县在今年6月前每五条耕牛要有一辆牛车，每一匹马有一辆马车，每三十亩地要有一架碎土耙，每三十亩田要有一架耙田机。要求在一个月内实现山区运输车子化。全县一百零八个乡，已组织木工、铁工共六百三十多人，从3月2日到8日六天时间，已制出手推车一百六十架，马拉、牛拉车八十三架，碎土机六架，洋桃磙四架。
    各乡在制造木车中，都贯彻了勤俭办社的精神，就地取材，木料自找，人工自出，铁钉自己加工，所以一架木车比购买价格低30％。
