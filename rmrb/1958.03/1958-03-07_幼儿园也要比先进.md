    Kindergartens Should Also Compete to Be Advanced
    Li Zi
    Currently, there are still some nurseries and kindergartens that spend a lot of the country's money, but the children they cultivate are not healthy enough in their thoughts and feelings. This is a very serious problem. To solve this problem, childcare work, like other work, must mobilize the masses and conscientiously conduct a rectification movement against waste and conservatism. In recent years, the Party, the government, and the Women's Federation have repeatedly called for running kindergartens diligently and thriftily. Many privately run and some state-organ nurseries and kindergartens have already implemented this policy. However, a considerable number of nurseries and kindergartens, especially those attached to state organs, have not yet made significant improvements. Some nurseries and kindergartens have significant waste in terms of staffing, funding, and infrastructure construction. There are even shocking instances of waste where one child costs 69 yuan per month, occupies 16 square meters of building space, and one staff member serves less than one and a half children on average. At a price of 0.12 yuan per jin of grain, one child's monthly living expenses are equivalent to more than 500 jin of grain! And 55 yuan of this is borne by the state! This is a serious irresponsibility to the country's financial and human resources and to the cause of early childhood education. The childcare workers in these nurseries and kindergartens do not have a meticulous, diligent, conscientious, and responsible work style. Therefore, they not only waste the country's funds, but also are lax in their childcare work. In individual nurseries, there have been cases where a child fell ill, and no one knew who the parents were or where they lived, making it impossible to send the child home. More seriously, under the influence of this work style, words, actions, and thoughts, coupled with the children's emphasis on eating well, dressing well, and being pampered, a "little aristocrat" atmosphere is growing in their minds.
    Some people believe that "children are the flowers of humanity and should eat and dress well." This statement is reasonable, but it is wrong to one-sidedly exaggerate and emphasize this aspect. Eating and dressing better means compared to the general living standards of the current society. If the children's lives are far removed from the people's level, this will raise the children as "little aristocrats." No wonder some children in nurseries and kindergartens say that the school is "shabby" when they enter elementary school, and they dislike the children of nearby residents as "poor"! What is even more unacceptable is that these nurseries and kindergartens only coax children to play and do not ask them to participate in more light labor, so that some children, after leaving the nursery and kindergarten, are unwilling to dress and eat on their own even when they return home. The children cultivated by this kind of nursery and kindergarten will be both spoiled and lazy.
    "At three, one can see what they will be like at old age; at seven, one knows their fate." Childcare is a very important part of the education cause. In order to improve childcare work, a high tide of anti-waste and anti-conservatism should also be launched in the childcare sector. Many nurseries and kindergartens (such as the Dafosi Kindergarten) have created rich work experience due to the implementation of the spirit of running kindergartens diligently and thriftily. Childcare workers should also have a movement to compete to be advanced and compete in enthusiasm. Let's compete to see who can cultivate more physically and mentally healthy children for socialism.

### 幼儿园也要比先进

    幼儿园也要比先进
    李梓
    目前还有一些托儿所、幼儿园，它们花了国家不少钱，而培养出来的孩子，在思想感情上却不够健康。这是一个很严重的问题。要解决这个问题，保育工作同其他工作一样，必须发动群众，认真地进行一次反浪费反保守的整风运动。几年来，党、政府和妇联一再提出勤俭办园的号召。许多民办的和部分国家机关的托儿所幼儿园，已经执行了这个方针。但是却有相当数量的托儿所幼儿园、特别是国家机关的托儿所幼儿园，迄今还没有显著的改进。有的托儿所、幼儿园在编制、经费、基建方面都有很大浪费。竟有一个孩子每月用费达六十九元，占用建筑面积十六平方公尺，一个工作人员平均服务不到一个半孩子的惊人浪费现象。以一角二分钱一斤粮食计算，一个孩子一个月生活费相当于五百多斤粮食！而其中有五十五元要由国家负担！这是对国家的财力人力物力和对幼儿教育事业严重的不负责任。在这种托儿所幼儿园里的保育工作者没有精打细算、勤勤恳恳、认真负责的工作作风，因此她们不仅浪费了国家的资金，而且在保育工作方面也是松弛的。在个别托儿所里，有过孩子生了病，不知家长何人，家住何处，无法把孩子送回家去的情况。更严重的是在这种工作作风言行思想的影响下，再加上孩子们吃得讲究，穿得讲究，娇生惯养，在思想上滋长着“小贵族”的气息。
    有人认为，“孩子是人类的花朵，应当吃得好点穿得好点。”这句话是有道理的，但是片面的夸大强调了这一面，就错误了。吃得好些、穿得好些是指比目前社会上一般人民生活水平而言。如果孩子们的生活远远脱离人民的水平，这就会把孩子们养成“小贵族”。难怪有些托儿所幼儿园的孩子进小学时说学校“破”，看见附近居民的孩子就嫌“穷”！更要不得的是，这些托儿所幼儿园只哄孩子玩，不叫孩子多参加些轻劳动，使得有些孩子离开托儿所幼儿园以后，回到家里连穿衣吃饭都不愿自己动手。这种托儿所、幼儿园培养出来的孩子，就会是既娇又懒的人。
    “三岁看大，七岁看老”，保育事业是教育事业中的极重要的一环。为了改进保育工作，在保育界也应该掀起一个反浪费反保守的高潮，很多托儿所、幼儿园（如大佛寺幼儿园）由于贯彻勤俭办园的精神，已经创造了丰富的工作经验，保育工作人员也应当来个比先进比干劲的运动。比一比谁能为社会主义培养出更多的身心健康的孩子。
