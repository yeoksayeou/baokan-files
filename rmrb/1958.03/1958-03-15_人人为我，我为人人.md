According to a March 4th report in the Beijing Daily: In mid-February, the Party Secretary and Director of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory made mobilization reports to all factory workers to discuss "for whom do we labor?". The report raised three questions: For whom exactly do we labor? Compared to revolutionary predecessors, how is our current drive? How should we work in the future? The report aroused widespread, rapid, and strong responses. At the workers' group heart-to-heart talks, many people voluntarily made self-examinations. Many people who had never spoken before or had always performed poorly eagerly poured out their innermost thoughts. Those who previously "made trouble about wages," "made trouble about quotas," and "made trouble about bonuses" now voluntarily requested to increase quotas and give up unreasonable bonuses. Those who used to arrive late and leave early now arrived early and left late. Those who used to be picky about their work now competed to do the hardest and most tiring work. Previously, they only paid attention to comparing ranks, treatments, rewards, and enjoyment; now, they compared efficiency, quality, savings, drive, and ideology. Some workers said: "This report and discussion truly 'opened our minds'!"

This report reflects that China's working class is riding the wave of rectification and advancing courageously. This report also raises two questions for us: First, in industrial and mining enterprises, there are still many people who have not fully established a correct attitude towards labor; second, in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, it is very necessary to organize workers to discuss the issue of for whom they labor and for whom they serve, and to correct the labor attitude of some people.

For whom to labor, for whom to serve, this is a question of outlook on life. There are various outlooks on life. There is the communist outlook on life of laboring for socialism and serving the people, and there is the bourgeois outlook on life of seeking personal fame and gain. In recent years, under the education of the Party, the masses of Chinese workers have gradually established a communist outlook on life. A large number of advanced elements have been increasingly tempered among the working masses. They put the interests of the revolution and the interests of the whole first, and put personal interests second. When personal interests conflict with revolutionary interests and overall interests, they can consciously subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests and overall interests. They labor sincerely and work loyally. They do not haggle with others about enjoyment, but haggle with others about their contribution to the revolutionary cause and about arduous struggle. They want to produce and work more and more, faster and faster, better and better, save more and more, and advance tirelessly. They endure hardship first and enjoy comfort later. On them, shines the selfless brilliance of the working class. However, there are also some people who, when it comes to labor, compare themselves with those who are not as good as them; when they encounter heavy work or work that earns less money, they try to avoid it and push it to others; when they encounter easy work, clean work, or work that earns more money, they rush to do it. When it comes to treatment, rank, and other life enjoyments, they always want to surpass others and compare themselves with the highest people, "tirelessly pursuing it." What others have, they must have; what others don't have, they must also have, endlessly pursuing it. In popular terms, these people are simply laboring for the "four big items" of watches, bicycles, radios, and woolen pants, and serving the Renminbi (RMB). For the sake of the "four big items" and for the sake of the RMB, they sometimes disregard the loss of state property. Some people even believe in the saying of the exploiting classes, "Heaven and earth will punish those who do not act for themselves."

In the working class ranks of socialist society, it is not surprising that quite a few people are not serving the people and laboring for socialism, but serving the RMB and laboring for the "four big items." Ideological consciousness belongs to the superstructure. Marxists believe that people's social existence determines their ideological consciousness. In class society, people's ideological consciousness is invariably stamped with the brand of the class. The working class is the most advanced class in human history, the last class, and takes the liberation of all mankind as its responsibility. There are no fundamental conflicts of interest among workers, nor are there any fundamental conflicts of interest with all oppressed and exploited working masses. Therefore, the working class is the most selfless class. In a socialist society where the people are the masters of their own affairs, the working class can most consciously serve the people and labor for socialism. "Everyone for me, me for everyone" is the fundamental relationship within the working class and within all working people in socialist society, and it is also the creed of the working class. However, the working class also grew up in a class society. Some of them came out of the mud and got a little mud on them, stained with a little petty-bourgeois or exploiter's ideology. What is so strange about that? Moreover, many new workers were still farmers cultivating their own small plots of land two or three years ago, or small vendors in the city, students at school, and a few were even exploiters. Now, although their class composition has changed, the ideological consciousness and outlook on life of the original class have not changed or have not fundamentally changed. They still need to undergo arduous ideological transformation to become true members of the working class. The outlook on life of serving the RMB and laboring for the "four big items" is contradictory to the historical position of the working class and to socialist ownership. This is a manifestation of the incomplete adaptation of the superstructure to the economic base. This contradiction has become a burden for some workers to move forward and an obstacle to the full development of social productive forces. We must help these people unload their burdens and let them move forward lightly with the times.

In the struggle to transform the world, mankind is also transforming itself. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people are striving to transform the motherland into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in fifteen years or less. The Chinese people are also fighting against the objective world with class differences, transforming it into a communist world without class differences. This is the greatest and most arduous struggle the Chinese people have encountered in the history of transforming the world. In this struggle, everyone is also fighting against the backward things in their own subjective world, that is, fighting against the ideological consciousness that proceeds from personal interests. In these two struggles, the working class is the leading class and the model for 600 million people. The working class must first fight against individualistic ideas, establish the communist labor attitude of "everyone for me, me for everyone," and develop the communist morality of enduring hardship first and enjoying comfort later, so that they are worthy of being the leader of 600 million people and worthy of being the model for 600 million people. The ongoing socialist revolution in politics and ideology is, for our working class, to correct the attitude towards labor, to correct the relationship between the individual and the country, and to eliminate the remnants of bourgeois individualism. Now, the surging waves of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement are impacting all individualistic ideological consciousness. Taking advantage of this opportunity, it will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort to organize a discussion on "for whom to labor, for whom to serve," just like the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory.

In socialist society, the fundamental interests of the individual and the interests of the country are consistent. There is a saying in our country, "If the big river has no water, the small river will dry up." If the country is poor, the people cannot become rich. Only when the country is rich and strong can the improvement of the people's living standards be reliably guaranteed. Everyone's labor is for the country and all the people, and also for themselves. Increasing the wealth of the country also increases the wealth for oneself. If the country becomes rich and strong, even if you don't serve the RMB, the RMB will still come; even if you don't struggle for the "four big items," the "four big items" will still be available, and there will be more and better ones. The future of our motherland is as bright as the rising sun. As long as the people of the whole country summon up their energy, strive for the upper reaches, a socialist society where everyone lives a happy life will appear quickly.

The spring of the Great Leap Forward has arrived. Everything rotten will surely die, and new buds will surely sprout. The entire social atmosphere, people's relationships with each other, and people's ideological outlook are changing in the rushing torrent of anti-waste and anti-conservatism. We must carry this movement through to the end, continue to transform our thinking in the movement, shake out the dirty things hidden in the depths of our souls, and transform ourselves into a true member of the working class who is the most selfless. Let "everyone for me, me for everyone" become the program of action for each of us!

### 人人为我，我为人人

    人人为我，我为人人
    据3月4日北京日报报道：2 月中旬，长辛店机车车辆修理工厂党委书记和厂长，分别向全厂职工做了讨论“为谁劳动”的动员报告。报告提出三个问题：我们究竟为谁劳动？跟革命前辈比起来，我们现在的干劲到底怎么样？今后我们应当怎么干？报告引起了广泛、迅速和强烈的反映。在职工的小组谈心会上，许多人都自动作了检查。许多从来不发言的人或者一贯表现落后的人，都一股劲儿倾吐自己的心里话。以前“闹工资”、“闹定额”、“闹奖金”的，现在都主动请求提高定额，放弃不合理的奖金。以前上班迟到早退的，现在都早来迟退。以前干活挑肥拣瘦的，现在都争着干最累、最辛苦的活。以前只注意比级别、比待遇、比奖励、比享受，现在比效率、比质量、比节约、比干劲、比思想。有的职工说：“这次报告和讨论真正‘开了脑筋’！”
    这一段报道，反映了我国工人阶级正在乘整改之风破浪前进。这一段报道也给我们提出了两个问题：一、在工矿企业里，还有不少人没有完全树立正确的劳动态度；二、在反浪费、反保守运动中，组织职工讨论一次为谁劳动、为谁服务的问题，端正一些人的劳动态度，很有必要。
    为谁劳动，为谁服务，这是一个人生观的问题。有各种各样的人生观。有为社会主义劳动，为人民服务的共产主义人生观，有为猎取个人名利的资产阶级人生观。几年来，在党的教育下，我国工人群众逐步树立起共产主义人生观。在工人群众中日益锻炼出大量的先进分子，他们把革命的利益、整体的利益放在第一位，把个人利益放在第二位。当个人利益与革命利益、整体利益发生矛盾的时候，他们能够自觉地把个人利益，服从革命利益和整体利益。他们诚诚恳恳地劳动，忠心耿耿地工作。他们不与别人计较享受，而与别人计较对革命事业的贡献，计较艰苦奋斗。他们生产和工作多了还要多，快了还要快，好了还要好，省了还要省，永无止息地前进。他们吃苦在前，享福在后。在他们身上，闪烁着工人阶级大公无私的光芒。但是，也有一些人，讲到劳动，要跟不如他的人比，遇到繁重的活，挣钱少的活，就设法避开推给别人做；遇到轻松的活，干净的活，挣钱多的活，就抢着干。讲到待遇、级别和其它生活享受，他们总想超过别人，跟最高的人比，“孜孜以求之”。别人有的，他要有；别人没有的，他也要有，永无止息地追求着。用流行的话来说，这些人是单纯的为手表、自行车、收音机、呢子裤“四大件”劳动，为人民币服务。为了“四大件”，为了人民币，他们有时候可以不顾国家财产受损失。有的人甚至相信“人不为己、天诛地灭”这句剥削阶级的口头语。
    在社会主义社会的工人阶级队伍里，居然有不少人不是为人民服务，为社会主义劳动，而是为人民币服务，为“四大件”劳动，这奇怪不奇怪呢？一点也不奇怪。思想意识是属于上层建筑的。马克思主义者认为，人们的社会存在，决定着人们的思想意识。在阶级社会中，人们的思想意识无不打上阶级的烙印。工人阶级是人类历史上最先进的阶级，最后的阶级，是以解放全人类为己任的。工人们彼此间没有基本的利害矛盾，跟一切被压迫、被剥削的劳动群众也没有基本的利害矛盾。所以，工人阶级是最大公无私的阶级。在人民当家作主的社会主义社会里，工人阶级最能自觉地为人民服务，为社会主义劳动。“人人为我，我为人人”在社会主义社会，是工人阶级内部和全体劳动人民内部的根本关系，也是工人阶级的信条。然而，工人阶级也是从阶级的社会里成长起来的，他们之中有一部分人出于污泥，身上沾了一点污泥，沾染一点小私有者或者剥削者的思想意识，这有什么奇怪呢？况且许多新工人，两三年前，还是在自己一小块土地上耕种的农民，或者是城市的小贩，学校的学生，少数人甚至是剥削者。现在，他们的阶级成分虽然改变了，但是原来阶级的思想意识、人生观，并没有改变或者没有根本改变。他们还需要经过艰苦的思想改造，才能成为真正的工人阶级。为人民币服务，为“四大件”劳动的人生观，是跟工人阶级的历史地位、跟社会主义的所有制相矛盾的。这是上层建筑和经济基础不完全相适应的表现。这个矛盾已经成为一部分工人前进的包袱，成为充分发展社会生产力的障碍。我们必须帮助这些人卸掉包袱，让他们跟着时代一起轻装前进。
    人类在改造世界的斗争中，也改造着自己。现在，我国人民正在共产党的领导下，为了在十五年或者更短的时间内，把祖国改造成具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国而奋斗。我国人民也正在向有着阶级差别的客观世界作斗争，把它改造成没有阶级差别的共产主义世界。这是我国人民在改造世界的历史中，所遇到的最伟大最艰巨的一次斗争。在这一次斗争中，每一个人都同时对自己主观世界中落后的东西作斗争，也就是对那些从个人利益出发的思想意识作斗争。在这两种斗争中，工人阶级是领导的阶级，是六亿人民的表率。工人阶级必须首先跟个人主义思想作斗争，树立“人人为我，我为人人”的共产主义劳动态度，养成吃苦在前，享福在后的共产主义道德，才不愧为六亿人民的领导，才不愧为六亿人民的表率。现在进行着的政治上、思想上的社会主义革命，对于我们工人阶级来说，就是端正劳动态度，端正个人与国家的关系，就是肃清资产阶级个人主义的残余。现在，反浪费反保守运动的滚滚波涛，正在向着一切个人主义的思想意识冲击着，顺风张帆，趁这个机会组织一次“为谁劳动，为谁服务”的讨论，一定能够像长辛店机车车辆修理工厂一样，收到事半功倍之效。
    在社会主义社会里，个人的根本利益和国家利益是一致的。我国有句俗话，叫做“大河没水小河干”，国家穷，人民也富不了，国家富强了，人民生活水平的提高才有可靠的保证。每一个人的劳动，是为国家及全体人民，也是为自己，给国家增加了财富，也就是给自己增加了财富。国家富强起来了，你不为人民币服务，人民币也是会来的；你不为“四大件”奋斗，“四大件”也是会有的，而且会更多更好。我们祖国的未来像朝阳般灿烂。只要全国人民鼓起干劲，力争上游，一个人人都过着幸福生活的社会主义社会，一定会很快地出现。
    大跃进的春天已经来临。一切腐朽的东西必将死亡，新生的嫩芽必将茁长。整个社会风气，人们的相互关系，人们的思想面貌，正在万马奔腾般的反浪费、反保守的激流中变化着。我们必须把这个运动进行到底，在运动中继续改造思想，把藏在灵魂深处的脏东西抖出来，把自己改造成一个真正的最大公无私的工人阶级的一分子。让“人人为我，我为人人”成为我们每一个人的行动纲领！
