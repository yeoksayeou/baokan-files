“Comparing Political Progress”

The students of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics have put forward a very good slogan: “Compare in production, compare in learning, compare in political progress.” “Comparing in political progress” is particularly important.

Chairman Mao said: “Whether intellectuals or young students, they should work hard to learn. In addition to studying their major, they should make progress in their thinking and in their politics. This requires studying Marxism and studying current affairs and politics. Without correct political views, it is like having no soul."

Who can believe that a person without a "soul" can serve the great cause of socialism well? Higher education is the end of school education, and students in higher education will immediately participate in this or that job after graduation; time waits for no one, and political progress must be achieved quickly. At this important juncture, comparing with each other and improving together is extremely necessary.

    “比政治进步”
    北京航空学院的同学提出了一个很好的口号：“比生产，比学习，比政治进步”。“比政治进步”，这点特别重要。
    毛主席说：“不论是知识分子，还是青年学生，都应该努力学习。除了学习专业之外，在思想上要有所进步，政治上也要有所进步，这就需要学习马克思主义，学习时事政治。没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”
    一个没有“灵魂”的人，谁能相信他能很好地为社会主义的伟大事业服务呢？高等学校是学校教育的尽头，高等学校的学生，毕业后马上就要参加这种或那种工作；时不我待，必须迅速求得政治进步。在这重要关头，互相比一下，共同提高，是万分必要的。
