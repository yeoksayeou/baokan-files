    Documentary Short "Give Your Heart to the Party"
    The Socialist Self-Remolding Promotion Conference and Parade held by various democratic parties and non-party figures on March 16th has been filmed by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio into a short film, "Give Your Heart to the Party," which is now being screened. Through the film, we can see many moving facts: this is the conference, where the Socialist Self-Remolding Covenant and a letter to Chairman Mao were adopted; this is the parade, with prominent figures like Shen Junru, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, etc., walking at the front of the procession. ... It demonstrates the determination and confidence of the various democratic parties and non-party figures in seeking self-remolding.

    纪录短片“把心交给党”
    三月十六日，各民主党派和无党派人士举行的社会主义自我改造促进大会和游行，已由中央新闻纪录电影制片厂拍成短片，——“把心交给党”上映了。通过影片，我们可以看到不少动人的事实：这是大会，会上通过了社会主义自我改造公约和上毛主席书；这是游行队伍，著名人士沈钧儒、李济深、郭沫若、黄炎培等走在队伍的前边。……它显示出了各民主党派和无党派人士要求自我改造的决心和信心。
