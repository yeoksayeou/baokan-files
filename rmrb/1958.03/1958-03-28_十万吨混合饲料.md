    100,000 Tons of Mixed Feed
    This year, Gansu Province's local industries plan to process and manufacture over 100,000 tons of mixed feed to help rural areas carry out a major reform of livestock feed.

    There are many raw materials for manufacturing mixed feed, including buckwheat husk, corn cob, rice husk, sweet clover, sand rice, cottonseed hull, acorns, rice bran, and dozens of others. The mixed feed currently used in Gansu Province involves combining several different feeds according to the needs of different livestock, grinding them with machines, sieving them, and adding soybean cake, distiller's grains, and minerals. Experiments have shown that livestock fed with mixed feed are stronger than those fed with single feed, diseases are reduced, and cattle, mules, donkeys, and pigs all love to eat it.

    十万吨混合饲料
    甘肃省地方工业今年准备加工制造十万吨以上的混合饲料，帮助农村进行牲畜饲料的大改革。
    制造混合饲料的原料很多，有荞麦皮、玉米芯、稻皮、草木樨、沙米、棉籽壳、橡子、米糠等数十种。甘肃省现在采用的混合饲料，是把几种不同的饲料，根据不同牲畜的需要，配合后用机器粉碎，用筛筛过，并掺入豆饼，酒糟和矿物质。经过试验，喂混合饲料的牲畜要比喂单一饲料壮实，疫病也减少，牛、骡、驴、猪都爱吃。
