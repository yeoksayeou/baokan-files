    Why the Neihuang Experience Cannot Be Promoted

    Neihuang County, Henan Province, has many advanced methods for drilling wells to reach springs and has also found many substitutes. For example, using reed strips instead of palm fiber, and using hemp fiber and willow branches instead of iron wire, which, due to the active support of county and township leaders, was done very thoroughly, so that palm fiber and iron wire were not needed for well-drilling. According to the Neihuang experience, each ten-zhang deep spring can save forty jin of palm fiber, twenty jin of thick iron wire, and four jin of thin iron wire, saving a total of forty-seven yuan. Fan County in Shandong Province has the same experience, but because county and township leaders failed to resolutely support it and accommodated backward methods, substitutes could not be promoted, and people were even sent to Tianjin to buy iron wire.

    If the Neihuang experience were seriously promoted nationwide, it could save the country a large amount of materials. If 100,000 wells are drilled across the country this year, it could save 4 million jin of palm fiber and more than 2 million jin of iron wire, worth 4.7 million yuan. However, some local leaders do not pay enough attention to this. For example, Shandong is still requesting the central government to allocate a large amount of palm fiber and iron wire. Therefore, in order to combat waste, we must resolutely fight right-leaning conservative thought to the end! Ge Yinxuan

    内黄经验为何不能推广
    河南内黄县在打井下泉方面有许多先进方法，也找了很多代用品。如用苇篾代替棕、用麻经和柳条代铁丝等，由于县、乡各级领导积极支持，做的非常彻底，打井可以不用棕和铁丝。按内黄经验，每个深十丈的泉可节省棕四十斤，粗铁丝二十斤，细铁丝四斤，共可节省四十七元。山东省范县也有同样的经验，但由于县、乡各级领导没能坚决支持，迁就落后的方法，结果不能推广代用品，还派人去天津买铁丝。
    内黄的经验如果认真地在全国范围内推广起来，就可以给国家节省大量物资，今年全国下泉以十万眼计，就可节省棕四百万斤，铁丝二百多万斤，价值四百七十万元。但有些地方领导还不够重视，例如山东还要求中央拨大批棕和铁丝。因此，为了反浪费，就要果敢坚决地向右倾保守思想斗争到底！　葛荫萱
