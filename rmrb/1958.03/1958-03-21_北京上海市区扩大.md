Xinhua News Agency, March 20th. A responsible person from the Beijing Municipal People's Committee told Xinhua News Agency reporters today: After the State Council decided to transfer the five counties of Shunyi, Tongxian, Daxing, Liangxiang, and Fangshan, originally under the jurisdiction of Hebei Province, and Tongzhou City to the jurisdiction of Beijing, the capital's existing population has increased from more than 4.06 million to more than 5.42 million, and the area has also increased from more than 4,540 square kilometers to more than 8,770 square kilometers.

The five counties and one city newly placed under the jurisdiction of Beijing form a crescent, closely guarding the eastern, southern, and southwestern sides of the capital. Transferring this area with a population of more than 1.35 million to the jurisdiction of Beijing is of great significance to the capital's long-term planning, the development of various construction undertakings, and the supply of non-staple foods.

This newspaper reports: In order to meet the needs of urban construction and development, the State Council has approved the transfer of the three counties of Jiading, Baoshan, and Shanghai, adjacent to Shanghai in Jiangsu Province, to the jurisdiction of Shanghai.

The three counties of Jiading, Baoshan, and Shanghai have a total land area of 1.28 million mu. The main crop is rice, with an annual output of 350 million jin. Economic crops such as cotton and rapeseed also have high yields. The three counties have a total population of 650,000. (Attached picture)

    北京上海市区扩大
    新华社20日讯　北京市人民委员会有关负责人今天对新华社记者说：国务院决定把原属河北省的顺义、通县、大兴、良乡、房山五个县和通州市划归北京市管辖以后，首都的现有人口已由四百零六万多人增加到五百四十二万多人，面积也由四千五百四十多平方公里增加到八千七百七十多平方公里。
    新划归北京市的五县、一市，像一弯新月，紧紧拱卫着首都的东方、南方和西南方。这块拥有一百三十五万多人口的地区划归北京市管辖后，对首都的长远规划、各项建设事业的发展和副食品的供应有很大意义。
    本报讯　为了适应城市建设发展的需要，国务院批准将江苏省邻近上海的嘉定、宝山、上海三县划归上海市管辖。
    嘉定、宝山和上海三县，土地面积共有一百二十八万亩，主要农作物是稻谷，年产三万五千万斤，经济作物如棉花、油菜产量也多。三个县共有人口六十五万。（附图片）
