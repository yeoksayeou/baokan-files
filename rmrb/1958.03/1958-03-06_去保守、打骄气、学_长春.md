    Get Rid of Conservatism, Overcome Arrogance, Learn from "Changchun"
    Our Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration has strong equipment conditions and teaching staff. But the work is slow, and what should be done cannot be done immediately. Here are some examples:
    Changchun Institute of Geological Exploration can publish expert lecture notes in a timely manner, why are we so slow? Their teachers have good connections with mines, acting as consultants, integrating scientific research with production, why can't we do this? Their production practice department can send teachers to contact mines earlier, why can't we? Their 1953 graduates can compile experimental guidance materials on genetic types of ore deposits, why haven't we compiled any?
    Ore Deposit Teaching and Research Section: Xiong Zengxi, Feng Shuzhuang
                                    Xia Hongyuan, Jiang Mingxia
                                    Cai Benjun
    Our entire group of postgraduate students in the Radioactive Teaching and Research Section, responding to the Party's call for work-study programs, can use our spare time to produce counters for radioactive analysis, use the existing equipment of the Teaching and Research Section to analyze samples for relevant production departments, teach courses on relevant radioactive exploration methods in secondary technical schools, and also give lectures in relevant training courses.

    去保守、打骄气、学“长春”
    我们北京地质勘探学院的设备条件和师资力量是很雄厚的。但工作迟缓，应该做的不能马上就做，仅举例说明：
    长春地质勘探学院专家讲稿能及时出版，我们为何这样慢？他们的教员和矿山联系好，作顾问、科学研究和生产结合紧，我们为什么不能这样作？他们的生产实习科能较早地派教员去和矿山联系，我们为什么不能？他们的1953年毕业生能编出矿床成因类型实验指导教材，我们为什么没编出？
    矿床教研室　熊曾熙、丰叔庄
                夏宏远、蒋明霞
                蔡本俊
    我们放射性教研组的全体研究生响应党提出勤工俭学的号召，可以利用课余时间生产放射性分析用的计数器，利用教研室现有设备替有关生产部门分析样品，到中等技术学校开有关放射性勘探方法的课程，还可以到有关训练班讲课。
                  刘延忠  吴至善　章晔等八人
