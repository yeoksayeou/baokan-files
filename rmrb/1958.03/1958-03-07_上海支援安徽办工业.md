    Shanghai Supports Anhui in Developing Industry

    Hefei, March 6th (from our newspaper) - Shanghai has decided to vigorously support Anhui Province in developing its industry through financial resources, technology, equipment, and other means.

    Currently, Shanghai has already invested over 10 million yuan in Anhui to support coal mining and the development of the iron and steel industry. Anhui Province has used these funds to start construction in Ma'anshan on two blast furnaces with an annual output of 52,000 tons, in Tongguanshan on two blast furnaces with an annual output of 80,000 tons, and in Suixi Coal Mine on two pairs of mine shafts with an annual output of 1.2 million tons. The blast furnaces being built in Ma'anshan are expected to be put into production on October 1st of this year. In addition, freezing plants and other factories will be built in Wuhu and Anqing.

    Shanghai is also prepared to supply Anhui Province with technical personnel and equipment, and will help Anhui build other factories. Both sides are currently in specific negotiations.

    上海支援安徽办工业
    本报合肥6日电上海市决定从资金、技术、设备等方面，大力支援安徽省发展工业。　　目前，上海已经向安徽投资一千多万元，支持安徽开采煤，发展炼铁工业。安徽省已经利用这些资金在马鞍山开始兴建年产五万二千吨的两个炼铁炉，在铜官山兴建年产八万吨的两个炼铁炉，在濉溪煤矿兴建年产一百二十万吨的两对矿井。在马鞍山兴建的炼铁炉今年10月1日就可以投入生产。此外，还要在芜湖市、安庆市兴建冷冻厂等工厂。
    上海市还准备供给安徽省技术力量和设备，并且要帮助安徽兴建一些其他的工厂。现在，双方正在具体协商中。
