In Local Newspapers

After Rectifying the Third Category Cooperatives

    On the 17th, the Anhui Daily reported on its front page that all 1,902 third-category cooperatives in the province had been rectified. Now the face of these cooperatives has greatly changed, with 65.9% rising to first-category cooperatives and 30.2% rising to second-category cooperatives. Only 3.9% were rectified in a relatively rough manner. In order to consolidate the results of the rectification, each locality has retained one to two members from the original rectification work teams to stay in the cooperatives for a long time to assist in the work. For the very few cooperatives that have not been thoroughly rectified, make-up lessons are being intensified. On the same day, the newspaper also carried a message reporting that the rectification of the first and second category cooperatives in the province has also begun, requiring that all rectifications be completed in the first half of the year. Various localities have sent a large number of cadres to form work teams to help the cooperatives at the grassroots level.

Farmers Run Their Own Middle Schools

    Recently, three agricultural middle schools founded by farmers themselves have appeared in Jiangsu Province, one in Shuanglou Township, Hai'an County, and the other two in Shiqiao Township, Hanjiang County. On the 15th, the Xinhua Daily reported on the establishment process of these three schools and published a commentary entitled "It's a Creation and a Miracle" to praise them. The students enrolled in these schools are mostly graduates from higher primary schools, and some are accountants and civilian teachers from agricultural cooperatives. The curriculum includes political, language, mathematics, and agricultural science and technology knowledge. Teachers are local outstanding high school graduates, cadres from agricultural technology extension stations, and cadres sent to lower levels. Local people believe that running this kind of middle school has many benefits: it is close to home, costs less money, it is part-work and part-study, learning and using are simultaneous, family income is not affected, and cultural technology can be learned.

Propaganda Work is Leaping Forward

    On the 14th, the "Party Life" column of the Liberation Daily had a large headline: "Propaganda Work is Leaping Forward". Under this large headline, several pieces of fresh news were published. The news "New Type of Party Class" reported on a Party class recently given by the Propaganda Department of the Yulin District Committee to party members of six factories. This class was given at the Shanghai Bicycle Factory, and the lecturer was Xing Guiquan, a worker party member of this factory. He did not talk about the clauses in the party member textbooks, but talked about how he took the lead in exposing his own and the leadership's conservative ideas. After he finished speaking, the comrades from the Propaganda Department of the District Committee made some supplements from the ideological principles. The party members were very satisfied with this party class. The other news reported that the theoretical instructors of the Propaganda Department of the Yulin District Committee gave theoretical lessons to factory cadres in combination with the actual situation of the Double-Anti Movement. The State Cotton Factory No. 1 used the gap of a few minutes before and after the shift and after meals to read the newspaper to the workers, and the Party branch of the Gao Juyuan Screw Factory organized a storytelling group to carry out propaganda activities...

Cultural Life is Blooming

    The amateur cultural activities of the masses in Mojiang County have shown a flourishing scene. In the whole county with more than 90 townships, most townships have established propaganda teams. The masses have created more than 1,000 works, including living dramas, small performances, Lusheng tunes, etc., which have become a powerful weapon to promote the central work. The Yunnan Daily reported the news on March 10, and published an editorial at the same time, saying that the cultural leap forward will not come automatically, and the role of the leadership is very important. The editorial also praised the practice of the Mojiang County Party Committee.

    在各地报纸上
    整了三类社以后
    17日安徽日报一版头条报道，全省一千九百零二个三类社已经整顿完毕。现在这些社的面貌大为改观，其中65.9％跃升为一类社，30.2％上升为二类社。整顿得比较粗糙的只占3.9％。为了巩固整社成果，各地都在原整社工作组中留下一人至二人长期驻社，帮助工作。对极少数整顿不透的社，正在加紧补课。同日报纸上还有一条消息，报道全省对一、二类社的整顿也已开始，要求在上半年全部整顿结束。各地已派出大批干部组成工作组到基层帮助整社。
    农民自己办中学
    最近在江苏出现了三所农民自己创办的农业中学，一所在海安县双楼乡，另外两所在邗江县施桥乡。15日新华日报报道了这三所学校创办的经过，并发表题为“是创举又是奇迹”的评论加以赞扬。这几所学校招收的学生大都是高小毕业生，也有一部分农业社的会计和民师。课程没有政治、语文、数学和农业科学技术知识。教师由本地优秀的高中毕业生、农业技术推广站的干部和下放干部担任。当地群众认为办这种中学好处很多：路近，花钱少，半耕半读，边学边用，家庭收入不受影响，又可以学到文化技术。
    宣传工作在跃进
    14日解放日报“党的生活”栏中有一个大标题：“宣传工作在跃进”。在这个大标题下发表了好几篇内容新鲜的消息。“新型的党课”这则消息报道榆林区委宣传部最近给六个厂的党员上的一堂党课。这堂课是在上海自行车厂上的，讲课的人是这个厂的工人党员邢贵泉。他讲的不是党员课本上的条文，而是讲他本人怎样带头揭发自己的和领导上的保守思想。他讲完了，区委宣传部的同志又从思想原则上作了一些补充。党员对这堂党课很满意。另外几条消息，报道了榆林区委宣传部的理论教员结合双反运动的实际向工厂干部讲理论课。国棉一厂利用班前班后和饭后几分钟的间隙向工人讲报，高聚源螺丝厂党支部组织说唱组进行宣传活动……
    文化生活百花怒放
    墨江县群众业余文艺活动出现了百花怒放的局面，全县九十多乡，绝大部分乡成立了宣传队，群众创作了一千多个作品，有活报剧、小演唱、芦笙调等，成了推动中心工作的有力的武器，云南日报3月10日报道了这个消息，同时发表社论说，文化大跃进不会自行到来，领导的作用非常重要。社论并表扬了墨江县委的作法。
