Patiently Listen to the Opinions of Subordinate Cadres
　　Yi Huai
    Recently, at a meeting of bureau directors convened by the Ministry of Railways, a small incident occurred: a bureau director's speech strayed far from the topic, and the comrade presiding over the meeting stopped him on the spot. Everyone was a bit embarrassed. The responsible comrade also felt that this was wrong, repeatedly stating that he should not have casually interrupted the comrade's speech, and apologized to the comrade. Although this matter is small, it vividly illustrates that many leading comrades are striving to improve their work style, using every means to eliminate the distance between themselves and subordinate cadres, making subordinate cadres feel that the relationship between leaders and those being led is completely equal.
    In the past, it was common for leading comrades to casually interrupt or even stop the speeches of subordinate cadres in meetings or during work reports, or to show impatience, even rudely scolding them, when faced with somewhat disorganized and lengthy speeches. Some leading comrades did this because they were very busy and could not spend a lot of time listening to lengthy and disorganized reports, requiring each report to get straight to the point, clearly and concisely raising the issues, so that they could listen to the reports of more comrades in a shorter period of time. Therefore, they would unconsciously become impatient when they heard someone's speech being verbose. There were also a few leading comrades who simply liked to scold people, rarely considering that they should also respect subordinate cadres, even believing that they could not show their identity as leaders without doing so. This is, of course, a very undesirable bureaucratic air. Even those leaders who unconsciously interrupt or even scold others have actually been tainted with bureaucracy. Because frequently interrupting or stopping others' speeches will make some comrades feel constrained or even embarrassed in front of leaders, unable to speak their minds freely, and will make subordinate cadres feel that the leaders do not have the sincerity to listen to their opinions, and are unwilling to talk about their own opinions. For example, some comrades may have thought of very good ideas or discovered very important problems, but when they think that if their words are not well spoken, they will be rebutted, they lose the courage to express their opinions, and even damage their enthusiasm. Some comrades may have different opinions on the decisions of the leadership, but when they think about the attitude of the leading comrades, they dare not raise them. This not only deprives leaders of some good opportunities to listen to opinions and understand the situation, but also damages the equal and intimate relationship that should exist between leaders and those being led under the socialist system, making it impossible for leaders and those being led to exchange opinions and discuss problems frankly, and even creating estrangement and distance between them. We hope that in this rectification movement, all leading comrades can actively eliminate these negative factors in superior-subordinate relationships.
    Of course, this does not mean that leading comrades should not express their opinions on the lengthy, disorganized, or unclear speeches of subordinate cadres. On the contrary, leaders have a responsibility to help subordinate cadres correct these shortcomings. However, some comrades' speeches are lengthy, disorganized, or far from the topic mainly because their ideological level is not high and they are clueless about the issues they are talking about. Therefore, the way to help is definitely not to stop them from speaking, but to patiently help them analyze the situation, clarify their thinking, and grasp the main issues, so that they gradually learn the method of analyzing problems.

    耐心听取下级干部的意见
    易槐
    最近，在铁道部召开的一次管理局长会议上，发生了这样一件小事：一位局长的发言扯得离题远了，主持会议的负责同志当场制止了他的发言。弄得大家都有些尴尬。这位负责同志也感到不对，连连表示自己不应该这样随便阻止同志的发言，并且向这位同志道歉。这件事情虽小，可是，它却生动地说明了不少领导同志正在努力改进自己的作风，用一切办法消除自己和下级干部之间的距离，使下级干部感到领导者和被领导者之间是完全平等的。
    在会议上或汇报工作的时候，领导同志随便打断以至阻止下级干部的发言，或者是对某些比较杂乱冗长的发言表示急躁、不耐烦，甚至粗暴地加以训斥，这种情况在过去是常见的。有些领导同志所以这样做，是因为他们工作很忙，不能用很多时间来听取冗长杂乱的汇报，要求每个汇报都能够开门见山、明确扼要的提出问题来，以便在较短的时间内多听取几个同志的汇报，因此，听到别人的发言囉嗦一些，就不自觉地急躁起来。也有少数领导同志就是喜欢训斥人，就很少考虑到自己也应该尊重下级干部，甚至以为不如此，就表现不出领导者的身份。这当然是一种很要不得的官气。就是那些不自觉地去阻止别人的发言以至训人的领导者，实际上也是沾染上了官气。因为，经常打断或阻止别人的发言，就会使某些同志在领导者面前感到拘谨以至难堪，不能畅所欲言，就会使下级干部感到领导者并没有听取他们的意见的诚意，而不愿多谈自己的意见。比如有些同志本来想到了很好的意见或者发现了很重要的问题，可是一想到万一自己的话讲得不好就会被顶回来的时候，就失掉了发表意见的勇气，甚至伤害了他们的积极性。有些同志对领导方面的决定，本来有些不同的意见，但一想到领导同志的态度，也就不敢提出来。这样，不仅使领导者失掉了一些听取意见了解情况的好机会。而且，破坏了社会主义制度下领导者与被领导者之间应有的平等的亲密的关系，使领导者和被领导者之间不能推心置腹地交换意见商讨问题，甚至使彼此之间有了隔阂和距离。我们希望在这次整风中，所有的领导同志都能主动地消除这种上下级关系中的消极因素。
    当然，这决不是说领导同志对于下级干部的冗长杂乱思想不明确的发言就不应该表示意见。相反的，领导者有责任来帮助下级干部纠正这种缺点。但是有些同志发言所以冗长杂乱或离题太远，主要是因为他们思想水平不高，对自己所谈的问题心中无数。因此，帮助的办法决不是阻止他们讲话，而是耐心地帮助他们分析情况，明确思想，抓住主要问题，使他们逐渐学会分析问题的方法。
