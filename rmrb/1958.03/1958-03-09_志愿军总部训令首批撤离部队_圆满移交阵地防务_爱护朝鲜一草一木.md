Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 8th - The headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army issued instructions to the first group of troops withdrawing from Korea to hand over the defense of positions to the Korean People's Army.

The instructions required the first group of troops withdrawing from Korea to provide a detailed explanation of the situation, terrain, our army's tasks, and fortifications to the Korean People's Army when the takeover troops of the Korean People's Army arrive; at the same time, they must complete the handover procedures for all barracks, camp equipment, and materials and equipment to be handed over as stipulated. Before the handover, the barracks and camp equipment should be repaired once to ensure the cleanliness of the camp area.

The instructions required all troops to cherish every mountain, river, plant, and tree in Korea before withdrawing from Korea. Before the operation, a mass discipline inspection should be carried out to ensure proper follow-up work and bid farewell to the local Korean government and people.

The instructions required the first group of Volunteer Army troops withdrawing from Korea to complete the task of handing over defense duties with a high degree of internationalist spirit and humbly learning from the Korean people and the People's Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 8th - The first group of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which is about to withdraw from Korea, is preparing everywhere to warmly welcome the Korean People's Army comrades who are coming to take over, under the slogan of "Everyone be friendly, everything be friendly."

In recent days, officers and soldiers have braved the severe cold to repair the positions and barracks. Some troops are rushing to build new heated platforms according to the habits of the People's Army officers and soldiers. In order to leave more refined grain to the People's Army comrades, they have long started to eat more coarse grains and are preparing to give the large number of pigs and sheep they raise to the People's Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 8th - The various units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are launching a high tide of enhancing Sino-Korean friendship, striving to complete the plan originally set by the Volunteer Army Party Committee for the entire army to assist the Korean people in production and construction with 300,000 man-days, several times over the target, before withdrawing from Korea.

A certain unit of the Volunteer Army, which will be withdrawn from Korea in the first batch before the end of April, decided to help the Korean people with 40,000 workdays before returning home. This unit has already built five canals and many small reservoirs for the local Korean people.

    爱护朝鲜一草一木
    新华社平壤8日电　中国人民志愿军总部向首批撤离朝鲜返国的部队发布了向朝鲜人民军移交阵地防务的训令。
    训令中要求首批撤离朝鲜的部队，在朝鲜人民军接防部队到达时，必须把当面情况、地形、我军任务和阵地工事等向朝鲜人民军接防部队作详细交代；同时办好所有营房、营具及规定移交的物资器材的交接手续。交防前要将营房、营具进行一次修缮，保证营区清洁。
    训令中要求各部队在撤离朝鲜前要爱护朝鲜一山一水一草一木。行动前应切实检查一次群众纪律，作好善后工作；并向驻地朝鲜政府和人民群众告别。
    训令中要求首批撤离朝鲜的志愿军部队，必须以高度的国际主义精神，虚心向朝鲜人民和人民军学习，圆满地完成交接防务的任务。
    据新华社平壤8日电　中国人民志愿军即将撤出朝鲜的第一批部队，在“人人友好、事事友好”的口号下，到处都在准备热情欢迎前来接防的朝鲜人民军战友。
    连日来，官兵们冒着严寒突击整修了阵地和营房。有些部队正按照人民军官兵的习惯，赶工新砌了热炕。为了多留细粮给人民军战友，他们早就开始尽量多吃粗粮，并准备把自己饲养的大批猪、羊送给人民军。
    据新华社平壤8日电　中国人民志愿军各部队正在掀起一个增进中朝友谊的高潮，争取在撤离朝鲜之前，超额几倍完成志愿军党委原定的全军以三十万个人工协助朝鲜人民进行生产建设的计划。
    即将在4月底以前第一批撤出朝鲜的志愿军某部队，决定在归国以前用四万个劳动日帮助朝鲜人民建设。这个部队已经为驻地朝鲜人民修了五条水渠和许多小型水库。
