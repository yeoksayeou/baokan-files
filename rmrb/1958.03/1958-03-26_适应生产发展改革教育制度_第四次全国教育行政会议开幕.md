Xinhua News Agency, March 24th—The Fourth National Education Administrative Conference opened in Beijing today.

In his speech, Dong Chuncai, Vice Minister of Education, pointed out that this meeting should oppose conservative thinking and promote a great leap forward in education, that is, promote the great development and reform of education, so that children and adults throughout the country can receive socialist education and become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness. Dong Chuncai said that a great leap forward in education will inevitably promote the realization of a cultural revolution, and the ultimate goal is to promote the great development of social productive forces.

Dong Chuncai pointed out that to promote a great leap forward in education, it is necessary to implement two guiding principles: one is the education policy proposed by Chairman Mao, "to enable those who receive education to develop in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness, and become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness"; the other is the socialist construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. He said that implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results in educational construction means implementing the mass line, boldly mobilizing the masses, and relying on the masses to popularize education, eliminate illiteracy, and even reform education. Socialist education is both a national undertaking and a mass undertaking, so in addition to schools run by the state, we must also implement schools run by the masses, work-study programs, and part-work, part-study. Another aspect of the mass line in education is to adopt mass movement methods to carry out the popularization of education and literacy work. Henan and Jiangsu have already achieved good experience in this regard.

Dong Chuncai said that to make a great leap forward, reform is essential. Therefore, this meeting mainly focuses on solving two major issues: educational reform and educational popularization. Educational reform must be carried out in accordance with the education policy proposed by Chairman Mao, and must meet the needs of production development. General education should provide students with general basic knowledge, and at the same time provide students with basic training in certain production technologies. Therefore, in addition to running ordinary middle schools, it is also necessary to run various forms of vocational middle schools, especially to vigorously run agricultural middle schools. Only in this way can secondary education meet the needs of production development. When reforming the school education system, attention should also be paid to both unity and diversity, combining unity and diversity. He said that in order to meet the needs of production development, it is necessary to popularize education. This meeting will study the popularization of education and the relationship between popularization and improvement. Dong Chuncai said that the key to improving the quality of education lies in the teaching staff, so the meeting will also discuss and solve the issues of teacher training and improvement.

More than 140 people attended the meeting, including directors of education departments and bureaus from various provinces and cities, as well as heads of education sections from counties with relatively good mass-run schools and popularized education, and principals of schools and privately-run primary schools that implement work-study programs and part-work, part-study.

    适应生产发展改革教育制度
    第四次全国教育行政会议开幕
    新华社24日讯　第四次全国教育行政会议今天在北京开幕。
    教育部副部长董纯才在讲话中指出，这次会议要反掉保守思想，促进教育事业的大跃进，即促进教育事业的大发展和大改革，使全国儿童和成人都能受到社会主义教育，变成有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。董纯才说，教育大跃进必然促进文化革命的实现，最终目的是为了促进社会生产力的大发展。
    董纯才指出，促进教育大跃进必须贯彻执行两条指导方针：一条是毛主席提出的“使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的教育方针；一条是多快好省的社会主义建设方针。他说，在教育建设方面贯彻多快好省的方针，就是要贯彻群众路线，放手发动群众，依靠群众来普及教育扫除文盲，以至改革教育。社会主义教育事业是国家事业，又是群众事业，所以除了国家办学之外，还要实行群众办学，勤工俭学、半工半读。教育工作的群众路线的另一方面是要采取群众运动的方式方法来开展普及教育和扫盲工作。河南、江苏在这方面已经取得了很好的经验。
    董纯才说，要大跃进，不改革就不行。所以这次会议主要是解决教育改革和教育普及两个大问题。教育改革必须根据毛主席提出的教育方针来进行，必须符合生产发展的需要。普通教育要给予学生普通的基础知识，同时还要给予学生一定生产技术的基本训练。所以除了办普通中学之外，还要办各种形式的职业中学，特别是要大办农业中学。只有这样，才能使中学教育适合生产发展的需要。在改革学校教育制度的时候，还要注意既有统一性又有多样性，把统一性和多样性结合起来。他说，为了适应生产发展的需要，必须普及教育。这次会议就要研究普及教育以及普及和提高的关系等问题。董纯才说，教育质量的提高，关键在于师资，所以会议也要讨论解决师资的培养和提高问题。
    参加这次会议的有各省、市教育厅局长，以及群众办学、普及教育开展得比较好的县教育科长和实行勤工俭学、半工半读的学校校长、民办小学校长等一百四十多人。
