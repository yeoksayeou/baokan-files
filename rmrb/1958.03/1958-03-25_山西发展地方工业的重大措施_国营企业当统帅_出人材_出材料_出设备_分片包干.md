Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th. State-owned industries in Shanxi Province are fully tapping the potential within enterprises to comprehensively support the great leap forward in local industries.

According to the requirements of the State-owned Industrial Enterprises Conference recently convened by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee, this support mainly comes from the following aspects: (1) State-owned industrial enterprises will transfer technical personnel to settle in local and county-run industries, cultivate technical forces for local and county-run industries, carry out technical transformation of local industries, and help improve technical levels. (2) State-owned industrial enterprises will implement zoned responsibility for the equipment and materials required by local and county-run industries. (3) Establish industrial networks centered on state-owned industrial and mining enterprises to support the development of local and county industries.

According to the above requirements, state-owned factories and mines throughout the province have already transferred the first batch of more than 600 engineering and technical personnel, who are about to depart to participate in local industrial construction. State-owned industrial enterprises in Taiyuan City have established contacts with various regions of the province to ensure a full supply of the equipment and materials needed by these regions in establishing and developing local industries. State-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Yangquan, Datong and other cities are also establishing contacts with nearby local industries. In terms of establishing industrial networks, five networks for agricultural machinery, coal, chemical fertilizers, power, and local specialties have now been established throughout the province, centered on larger state-owned factories and mines. County-run and local industries in each industrial network regard state-owned factories and mines as commanders. The five large state-owned factories in the agricultural machinery repair and assembly network not only provide systematic technical instruction to the twenty medium-sized factories and small factories in each county for which they are responsible, but also help solve a series of production and construction problems.

    国营企业当统帅
    出人材　出材料　出设备　分片包干
    新华社太原24日电　山西省国营工业正在充分挖掘企业内部潜力，全面支援地方工业大跃进。
    根据中共山西省委和山西省人民委员会最近召开的国营工业企业会议的要求，这一支援主要从下列方面进行：（一）国营工业企业抽调技术人员，到地方工业和县营工业中去安家落户，为地方工业和县营工业培养技术力量，对地方工业进行技术改造，帮助提高技术水平。（二）国营工业企业对地方工业和县营工业所需的设备、材料、实行分区包干。（三）建立以国营工业厂矿为中心的工业网，扶植地方工业、县工业发展。
    根据上述要求，全省国营厂矿已经抽调了第一批六百多名工程技术人员，即将出发参加地方工业建设。太原市国营工业企业已经分别和全省的各个专区建立联系，保证充分供应这些专区在建立和发展地方工业中所需的设备、材料。阳泉、大同等市的国营工矿企业也正在和附近的地方工业建立联系。在建立工业网方面，现在全省已经以较大的国营厂矿为中心建立了农业机械、煤炭、化学肥料、动力和土特产等五个网，每个工业网中的县营工业、地方工业都把国营厂矿当统帅。农业机械修配网的五个大型国营厂，对分片包干的二十个中型厂和每个县的小型工厂，不仅进行系统的技术传授，而且还帮助解决一系列生产、建设上的问题。
