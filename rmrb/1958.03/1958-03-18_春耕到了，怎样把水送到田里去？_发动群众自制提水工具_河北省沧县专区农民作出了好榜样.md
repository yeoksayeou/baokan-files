Xinhua News Agency, Cangzhen, March 17th: In order to fully utilize the irrigation efficiency of water conservancy projects and promote a great leap forward in agricultural production, Hebei Province began a provincial water lifting tool conference in Cangzhen on the 17th, summarizing and promoting the advanced experience of Cangxian Special District in relying on the masses to manufacture and transform water lifting tools, and launching a mass movement to manufacture water lifting tools throughout the province. At the same time, Cangxian Special District also held a simple water lifting tool exhibition.

Since last winter, with the great development of water conservancy construction in Cangxian Special District, the contradiction of insufficient supply of water lifting tools has emerged. The special district plans to irrigate 15 million mu this year (more than 88% of the total cultivated area). In addition to 5 million mu of gravity irrigation, 10 million mu still need to be irrigated by water lifting, while the original various water lifting tools can only irrigate more than 2.6 million mu. The number of water lifting tools must be increased by more than two times to meet the demand. However, local industrial, handicraft, and supply and marketing departments are far from meeting this need, and due to the lack of raw materials, most of the water lifting tools will not be delivered until the second half of the year, which will have a great impact on the irrigation plan for the first half of the year. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives also have difficulties in raising funds to manufacture water lifting tools. According to the 270,000 waterwheels and 3,000 pot-camel machines requested by the agricultural cooperatives in the district, a total of 48.9 million yuan is needed, averaging 10.06 yuan per person in the district, which is a heavy burden and not easy to handle. In order to solve this contradiction, the Cangxian District Committee of the Communist Party of China called on the party committees at all levels to overcome the idea of simply relying on national supply, but to "look down and reach down," adhering to the principle of "local materials, self-made by cooperatives, small and diverse, low cost, and high efficiency," and resolutely mobilize and rely on the masses to vigorously carry out a mass movement to manufacture and transform water lifting tools.

Party committees at all levels universally adopted the method of "mobilizing, manufacturing, utilizing, visiting, learning, and promoting simultaneously," which rapidly promoted the development of this movement. Difficulties such as insufficient supply of wood and lack of funds were overcome by relying on the strength of the masses. For example, members of the Wuqiao County Agricultural Cooperative contributed more than 300 cubic meters of wood and invested 850,000 yuan. The materials invested by members of the Wuqiang County Agricultural Cooperative can be used to manufacture 5,000 waterwheels. In just a few months, more than 100 kinds of simple water lifting tools appeared in the district, totaling more than 30,000 pieces. Two-thirds of them were made by the agricultural cooperatives themselves, and one-third were produced and supplied by local industrial and handicraft departments. These water lifting tools are mostly hand-cranked or foot-operated, a few are pulled by animal power, and individual ones are driven by wind power, water power, or power machinery; they are suitable for use on wells, channels, ponds, reservoirs, and for both wells and channels.

Using local materials, simple manufacturing, convenient use, low cost, large water output, popular among the masses, and able to be made by every cooperative are the common characteristics of these diverse water lifting tools. The materials used in these water lifting tools, except for a few iron pipes and iron chains, are generally made of wood and bamboo, or are transformed and matched with discarded old looms and broken car wheels. For example, the Chengguan Wood Factory of the Wuqiao County Supply and Marketing Cooperative used old looms, large car wheels, and shafts to transform into a loom-style large car wheel foot-operated double wood pipe waterwheel. The cost of wood components and nails is only more than ten yuan, which is suitable for use on wells and channels. One person can irrigate 9 to 12 mu of land a day, which is 2 to 3 times more efficient than the Liberation-style waterwheel. Moreover, the operator can sit on the frame and read books or make shoe soles, which people call "semi-mechanization." This factory also imitated a cloth sail windmill, which can drive one waterwheel with a level 3 wind and two waterwheels with a wind above level 3. Its power is equivalent to a 3.5 to 7.5 horsepower pot-camel machine, and each unit can irrigate 40 to 50 mu to about 100 mu of land per day and night. The hand-pressed bamboo pipe suction devices successfully manufactured by some agricultural cooperatives in Yanshan, Nanpi, and Cangxian not only have the advantages of directly lowering the pipe on flat ground, not occupying land (no well), and irrigating two mu of land a day, but also cost only five yuan each. The purely wooden hand-cranked waterwheel made by farmers in Jiaohe County does not use iron for all the flower wheels, pipes, chains, and other components, and each unit costs only 20 yuan, which is more than two-thirds less than manufacturing a five-wheel waterwheel, and the water output is twice as high. Farmers in Wuqiang County changed the pulley water scoop into a pulley-style hand-cranked thick pipe waterwheel, which is light and easy to use, and can be used by the elderly and children. One person's daily irrigation increased from more than half a mu to more than six mu.

The large-scale production of simple water lifting tools has played an active role in Cangxian Special District's fight against the current drought and striving to complete and overfulfill the sowing task of more than 6 million mu of summer harvest crops. The original various water lifting tools in the district could only irrigate more than 2.6 million mu. After the recent addition of this batch of new water lifting tools, many water conservancy projects that could not be gravity-irrigated have been able to exert their irrigation efficiency, and 5 million mu of land in the district has been irrigated and planted with spring wheat. Among them, more than 1 million mu of land was irrigated and early-sown using these water lifting tools.

At present, the agricultural cooperatives in Wuqiang, Wuqiao, and Jiaohe counties in Cangxian Special District have established more than 1,200 water lifting tool processing factories and iron and wood repair groups, with a total of more than 4,900 members with iron and wood technology. In addition to continuing to rush to manufacture various simple water lifting tools, the agricultural cooperatives are also improving the water lifting tools that have already been manufactured, striving to further reduce costs and increase efficiency, and striving to achieve water conservancy in the entire district by the "May Day" holiday this year.

    春耕到了，怎样把水送到田里去？
    发动群众自制提水工具
    河北省沧县专区农民作出了好榜样
    本报特约新华社沧镇17日电　为了充分发挥水利工程的灌溉效能，促进农业生产大跃进，从17日开始，河北省在沧镇召开了全省提水工具会议，总结推广沧县专区依靠群众制造和改造提水工具的先进经验，在全省掀起一个群众性制造提水工具的运动。同时，沧县专区也举办了简易提水工具展览会。
    去冬以来，沧县专区随着水利建设大发展，出现了提水工具供应不上的矛盾。全专区今年计划灌溉面积要达一千五百万亩（占总耕地面积88％强），除了自流灌溉五百万亩外，还有一千万亩要靠提水浇灌，而原有各种提水工具只能浇地二百六十多万亩，提水工具必须再增加两倍以上才够用。但是，当地工业、手工业和供销部门远远不能满足这个需要，而且由于原材料缺乏，大部分提水工具要等到下半年才能交货，对上半年的灌溉计划将发生极大的影响。同时，农业社筹措制造提水工具的资金也有困难。据全区农业社要求供应的二十七万辆水车和三千台锅驼机计算，共需四千八百九十万元，平均全区每人要分摊十元零六角，负担很大，不容易办到。为了解决这个矛盾，中共沧县地委号召所属各级党委克服单纯依赖国家供应的思想，而要“眼睛向下看，手向下伸”，本着“就地取材，社社自造，小型多样，成本低，效率高”的原则，坚决发动和依靠群众，大力开展一个群众性的制造和改造提水工具的运动。
    各级党委普遍采用了“边发动，边制造，边利用，边参观，边学习，边推广”的办法，迅速促进了这个运动的开展。木料供应不够和资金缺乏等困难，都依靠群众的力量加以克服。例如吴桥县农业社社员自己拿出的木料就有三百多立方，投资达八十五万元。武强县农业社社员投出的物料可供制造五千辆水车用。在短短的几个月中，全区出现了一百多种简易提水工具，共达三万多件。其中三分之二是农业社自己制造的，三分之一是当地工业和手工业部门生产供应的。这些提水工具，多数用手摇、足蹬，少数用畜力拉，个别的靠风力、水力和动力机械带动；它们分别适于井上用，渠道、坑塘、水库上用，以及井渠两用等。
    就地取材，制造简单，使用方便，造价低廉，出水量大，群众欢迎，社社能造，是这些形式多种多样的提水工具的共同特点。这些提水工具所用的材料，除少数铁管、铁链外，一般部件都是用木料和竹子，或是利用废置的旧织布机、破轿车轮等加以改装配搭而成的。例如吴桥县供销社城关木工厂，利用旧织布机、大车轮和轴改装成的织机式大车轮脚蹬双木管水车，木质部件和钉子等所费不过十多元，适于井渠上用。一人一天能浇九至十二亩地，比解放式水车的效率高二、三倍。而且操作者坐在架子上，还可看书报或纳鞋底，人们称它为“半机械化”。这个厂还仿造了一种布帆风力车，三级风能带动一辆水车，三级以上的风能带动两辆水车。它的力量相当于一台三点五到七点五马力的锅驼机，每架一昼夜能浇地四、五十亩到百亩左右。盐山、南皮、沧县等地部分农业社制造成功的手压竹管吸水器，不但具有平地直接下管、不占地（无井）、一天可浇二亩地等优点，而且每件只要五元钱就够了。交河县农民制造的纯木制手摇水车，所有花轮、管子、链子等部件都不用铁，每辆才二十元，比制造五轮水车少花三分之二以上的费用，而且出水量高两倍。武强县农民把辘轳水兜改成辘轳式手摇粗管水车，轻便好使，老人小孩都能用，一人一天浇地由半亩多增加到六亩多。
    简易提水工具的大量制成，对沧县专区各地战胜当前旱象，争取完成和超额完成六百多万亩夏收作物播种任务，起了积极的作用。全区原有的各种提水工具只能浇地二百六十多万亩。最近增加这批新提水工具后，使许多不能自流灌溉的水利工程发挥了灌溉效能，全区已有五百万亩地浇了水，种了春麦。其中有一百万亩以上的地，就是用这些提水工具进行浇地和早播的。
    目前，沧县专区的武强、吴桥、交河三县的农业社，共建立了一千二百多个提水工具加工厂和铁木修配小组，投入有铁木工技术的社员共达四千九百多人。各农业社除了继续赶造多种多样的简易提水工具外，同时改进已经制造出来的提水工具，争取进一步降低成本，提高效率，力争到今年“五一”节胜利实现全区水利化。
