We—Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory, Tianjin Shoe Factory, Tianjin Power Machinery Factory, Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory, and State-owned Factory X—in order to promote the revolutionary vigor of propaganda cadres, propose to all brother factories in the city: to launch a propaganda work competition. Through the competition, we will eliminate the bureaucratic air, the sluggish air, the extravagant air, the arrogant air, and the evil air in our propaganda work, so that propaganda work will always be at the forefront of the movement, acting as the vanguard of the movement. At present, this competition focuses on vigorously publicizing and mobilizing the broad masses of workers to engage in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement.

Our general goal is: to raise the socialist consciousness of the working class and promote a great leap forward in production and ideology.

Our specific conditions are as follows:

I. Strengthen the ideological and combative nature of propaganda work. Closely integrate with the central tasks of each period, and conduct ideological education and publicity activities vividly and actively in connection with reality. Ensure the following: 1. According to the Party's policies and guidelines, put forward clear action slogans within a certain period, making them known to everyone and deeply rooted in people's hearts, so that the broad masses of workers have clear goals to strive for. 2. Proactively understand and study the ideological situation of the masses, strive to eliminate erroneous ideas in their infancy, and specifically solve the ideological problems existing among workers by using the method of opening each lock with a key to inspire revolutionary enthusiasm. 3. Adopt methods such as debates, visits, and comparisons to conduct political and ideological education, and learn from the advanced through mass self-education. 4. Regularize current affairs propaganda. Establish a current affairs propaganda team, improve the group reading system, open up current affairs propaganda positions in the workshops, and conduct current affairs policy and political thought reports once a month.

II. The forms of propaganda are vivid, lively, and diverse. Adopt various forms according to the different preferences of the masses, so that "every group has propaganda, every section (or workshop) has a position."

III. Propaganda work is timely, accurate, thorough, and meticulous, achieving "a great leap forward in production, propaganda charges forward," publicizing events on the same day (or the next day), and not burying the creativity and advanced deeds of the masses.

IV. Organize a mighty army of propaganda, widely absorbing activists from all aspects to participate in propaganda work. Those who can speak should speak, those who can draw should draw, those who can sing should sing, everyone does propaganda, and everyone receives education. Organize propaganda activists, implement the mass line of propaganda work, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Strengthen the leadership of mass cultural activities, and promote club work and various cultural activities to serve production.

In order to achieve the above guarantees, we will take the following measures:

I. The secretary takes the lead, the whole Party does ideological work, and gives full play to the role of the trade union and the Communist Youth League.

II. Carry out a "five comparisons" competition of propaganda work within the factory, comparing content, form, timeliness, team, and effect, with monthly inspections and quarterly evaluations.

III. Hold a meeting of Party, trade union, and Youth League propaganda cadres once a month to clarify the direction and unify the steps.

IV. Establish a policy and business learning system to improve the professional level of propaganda cadres. Take Party newspapers and periodicals as regular learning materials. Each propaganda cadre should formulate a learning plan. Change the style of work, go deep into the groups, and provide assistance at all levels.
