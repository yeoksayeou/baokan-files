Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 3rd: Soviet Academy of Sciences Corresponding Academician Fedorov told Xinhua reporter Li Nan: The Soviet Union's technological strength now fully enables it to launch artificial satellites with various equipment and weights into outer space, and their altitude can be higher or lower depending on the mission.

Fedorov is a member of the Soviet International Geophysical Year Committee, specializing in the study of the upper atmosphere and the launching of rockets and artificial satellites within the committee. At the request of this agency's reporter, he spoke about the extensive achievements of the Soviet Union in geophysical exploration over the past seven months.

Fedorov introduced the significant role of the use of rockets and artificial satellites in studying the upper atmosphere, solar and cosmic phenomena, and spaceflight. He said that the Soviet Union's two satellites have obtained a wealth of materials, which are currently being processed. Conclusions have not yet been drawn, but preliminary answers can be obtained for individual issues. The impact of weightlessness on body tissues and the destruction of normal functions are not very serious, so special equipment may not be necessary for future human spaceflight. The satellites have been flying for a long time, but no danger of collision with meteorites has been observed. The effects of cosmic rays have also been well observed. The intensity of cosmic rays varies at different latitudes. The closer to the poles, the lower the energy of cosmic rays; the closer to the equator, the higher the energy.

Soviet scientists are still continuing to study and improve artificial satellites.

Future interstellar flight is multifaceted. The first task is of course to go to the moon. The first step is to land instrument-carrying rockets on the moon. This is a task that is likely to be achieved soon. The second is for rockets to orbit the moon and return to Earth. This task is more difficult because, in addition to the necessary speed, the parabola of the flight must be calculated precisely and the rocket's operation adjusted. The third is for rockets to land on the moon and then fly back to Earth. This problem has not yet been solved technically. It will take more time to solve.

Fedorov pointed out that Soviet geophysical research has received great attention from the Party and the government. The achievements made in the past seven months are considerable. The Soviet Union has about five hundred observation stations, accounting for about one-quarter of the total number of observation stations in the world, making the Soviet Union the country with the most stations. Soviet scientists have collected a wealth of meteorological materials and have conducted observational research on the sun, crustal structure, and the Earth's magnetic field, obtaining beneficial results.

When talking about the progress of the entire International Geophysical Year, Fedorov said that this work is progressing well and will promote the development of international scientific cooperation and make a significant contribution to world science. But there are still shortcomings. The failure of China to participate is a major deficiency. Countries around the world have sent a large amount of material about Soviet satellites, but the United States has sent very little.

### 可轻可重　可高可低  苏联能够发射各种人造卫星  两个卫星提供的材料帮助了打开月宫之门

    可轻可重　可高可低
    苏联能够发射各种人造卫星
    两个卫星提供的材料帮助了打开月宫之门
    据新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联科学院通讯院士费多罗夫对本社记者李楠说：苏联的技术力量现在完全能够发射带有各种装备的、各种重量的人造卫星到外层空间，而其高度根据任务不同可以更高一些，也可以低些。
    费多罗夫是苏联国际地球物理年委员会委员，在委员会内专门研究大气高层和发射火箭和人造卫星的工作。他应本社记者之请，谈到了苏联过去七个多月中在地球物理考察方面的广泛成就。
    费多罗夫介绍了火箭和人造卫星的使用在研究大气高层、太阳和宇宙空间的现象以及宇宙飞行方面的重大作用。他说，苏联的两个卫星已经获得了丰富的材料，目前正在对这些材料进行加工，结论还未作出，但对于个别问题已可得出初步答案。失重对于身体组织的影响和对正常机能的破坏是并不怎样严重的，因此将来人类从事宇宙飞行时可以不要特殊的装置。卫星飞行时间很长，但没有观察到和陨石相碰的危险。对宇宙线的影响也曾作了很好的观察。在各种不同的纬度上，宇宙线的强度是不一样的。越近两极，宇宙线的能量越小，越接近赤道，能量越大。
    现在苏联科学家还在继续研究改进人造卫星的问题。
    未来星际飞行是多方面的。首先的任务当然是到月球上去。第一步是带仪器的火箭到月球上降落。这是最近就很可能实现的任务。其次是火箭围着月亮运转，并且回到地球上来。这个任务要困难一些，因为除了必要的速度之外，还必须精确地计算飞行的抛物线和调整火箭的运行。第三是火箭在月球上着陆然后又飞回地球上来。这个问题从技术上讲目前还未解决。还需要更多的时间才能解决。
    费多罗夫指出，苏联地球物理研究受到党和政府很大的重视。七个月来获得的成绩是相当可观的。苏联设的观测站约有五百个，占全世界观测站总数四分之一左右，苏联是世界各国中设站最多的一个国家。苏联科学家搜集到了丰富的有关气象的材料，对太阳，地壳构造，地球磁场都作了观测研究，获得了有益的成果。
    在谈到整个国际地球物理年进行情况时，费多罗夫说，这项工作进行良好，会促进国际间科学合作的发展，对世界科学也是件重大的贡献。而缺点也还是有的。中国未能参加就是一个很大的不足之处。世界各国都送来了大量关于苏联卫星的材料，但是美国却送来很少。
