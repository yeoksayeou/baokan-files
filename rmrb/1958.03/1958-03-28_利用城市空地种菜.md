    Utilizing Urban Vacant Land for Vegetable Growing
    In recent years, cultivated land in the suburbs of many large cities has been occupied by basic construction, significantly reducing the area for vegetable planting.
    From what I have personally seen, there are many vacant lots within the newly built government offices, schools, factories, and their dormitories, which are left idle and barren year-round. Taking our factory as an example, it is estimated that there are more than thirty mu of such vacant land. This land was originally arable. In the summer, these vacant lots grow weeds half a person tall, becoming breeding grounds for mosquitoes. To remove the weeds, a large amount of labor must be spent. If the labor spent on weeding is used for planting vegetables, it would eliminate one harm and create one benefit.
    If all the vacant land within government offices, enterprises, schools, and their dormitories in the near suburbs of Beijing were used to grow vegetables, it could reduce a large portion of the vegetable supply needed from the market.
    The whole year's work depends on a good start in spring. Now is the time when spring rain is abundant, the season for cultivation. I hope that we do not miss the opportunity and take active action!

    利用城市空地种菜
    近年来许多大城市郊区的耕地被基本建设所占，大大削减了蔬菜的种植面积。
    据我亲自所见，在新建的机关学校、工厂及其宿舍内，还有很多空地，常年闲置，任其荒芜。就以我们厂来说，估计就有三十来亩之多这些空地原来都是可耕地。在夏季，这些空地草长半人高，成为蚊虫藏身之所。为了拔除杂草，又必须花费大量人工。如将除草花费之工，用于种植蔬菜，则兴一利而杜一弊。
    如将北京近郊所有的机关、企业、学校及其宿舍内的空地，用来种蔬菜，就可以减少市场一大部分的蔬菜供应量。
    一年之计在于春，现在正当春雨饶足之时，正是耕耘的季节，希望莫要坐失时机，积极行动起来吧！
