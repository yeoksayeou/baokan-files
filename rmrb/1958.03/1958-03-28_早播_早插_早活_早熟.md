    Rice Planting Experts Impart Techniques
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 27th. The willows have just begun to sprout tender leaves, and in the rice-growing areas of northern Jiangsu, early rice seeds are already being soaked, ready for sowing. Various agricultural cooperatives are preparing seedbeds, and many members are using the gaps during rainy days and evenings to rush to weave straw mats and bamboo curtains, preparing wind and frost protection equipment for this year's seedlings. The slogan among the masses is: "Early sowing, early transplanting, early survival, early maturity," and all actions are moving ahead of schedule.
    Many agricultural cooperatives have invited rice planting experts to impart cultivation techniques. Jianhu County has already achieved a situation where every township has experienced farmers, technical personnel, full-time cadres, and typical demonstrations. Production teams in various agricultural cooperatives have already finalized the double-cropping rice paddy area, determined the rice varieties, and scheduled the cultivation season. Xinghua County, with the largest rice paddy area, plans to use more than half of the county's well-mucked fields, or 500,000 mu, for double-cropping rice cultivation. Farmers in Jingjiang County, along the Yangtze River, are busy accumulating spring fertilizer, initiating a surge of accumulating "thousand-foot mud." Members of agricultural cooperatives such as Zhanggong and Lianhua are accumulating fertilizer outdoors on sunny days and shoveling fertilizer ash and mud from under water tanks and pot mouths indoors on rainy days. When they can't finish during the day, they continue working at night with gasoline lamps; when gasoline lamps are not enough, they light up the small glass lamps used to catch rice borers between summer and autumn for illumination.
    The Jingjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is adopting the method of "trial first, observe then promote" to promote the experience of "cultivating strong seedlings."
    Guangdong:
    Five Measures in Sihui County
    This newspaper reports that after inspecting spring plowing production work in Sihui County on March 13, the Spring Plowing Production Inspection Team of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed five measures that should be addressed to advance early transplanting (complete transplanting before Qingming Festival):
    1.  The reform of cultivation techniques should be carried out in depth among the masses, with the cooperative and the team as the units, to carry out comparisons and overcome conservative thinking. At the same time, strict requirements should be made for specifications and quality. The county, township, and cooperative should strictly inspect each level. If any are found to be substandard, they should be remedied in a timely manner. 2. Conscientiously do a good job of seedling field management, topdressing with quick-acting fertilizer, and cultivate strong seedlings. In addition to completely eliminating any insects found in the seedling fields, widespread seedling disinfection should also be carried out. 3. Seize the time in the next few days to send all fertilizer to the fields, irrigate the fields for soaking, and achieve three plows and three harrows, leveling and tilling the fields, and storing water to prevent drought. 4. Comprehensively and thoroughly inspect and accept water conservancy construction projects to prevent complacency and slackness. A plan for continuing to build water conservancy projects after spring plowing should be made, and efforts should be made to completely overcome the water conservancy problem this year. 5. Each cooperative should immediately carry out spring plowing and transplanting planning. If there is a shortage of seedlings, replanting should be done immediately on the same day. If the seedlings are not strong, management should be strengthened immediately. If fertilizer delivery and field preparation are slow, a concentrated effort should be made immediately. In order to ensure timely transplanting, 70% of the labor force should be concentrated on spring plowing. If the labor force is still insufficient, labor efficiency should be actively improved.

    早播·早插·早活·早熟
    苏北：
    植稻能手传技术
    据新华社南京27日电杨柳刚刚长出嫩叶，苏北水稻地区早稻已经普遍浸种，即将落谷。各个农业社正在做秧池，很多社员利用阴雨、夜晚的空隙时间，赶编草苫柴帘，为今年秧苗做好防风、防霜的设备。群众中的口号是：“早播、早栽、早活、早成熟”，一切行动都走在时间的前面。
    许多农业社请来的植稻能手，正在传授栽培技术。建湖县已经做到乡乡有老农、有技术人员、有专职干部和有典型示范；各个农业社生产队已经做到双季稻稻田面积定案、水稻品种定案和栽培季节定案。稻田面积最多的兴化县，准备把全县熟沤田一半以上即五十万亩稻田用来栽培双季稻。长江畔的靖江县农民，正在忙着积春肥，掀起积“千脚泥”的热潮。张公、联华等农业社社员，晴天在屋外积肥，雨天在室内铲水缸底下、锅门口的肥灰泥。白天干不完，夜晚点了汽油灯继续干；汽油灯不够用，把夏秋之间捉螟蛾用的小玻璃灯都点起来照明。
    中共靖江县委正在采取“先试后看再推广”的办法，推行“培育壮秧”经验。
    广东：
    四会县五项措施
    本报讯　中共广东省委春耕生产检查工作组，3月13日到达四会县检查了春耕生产工作后，提出了当前提早插秧（清明前插完）要注意解决的五项措施：
    一、栽培技术的改革，要以社和队为单位，在群众中进行深入的辩论，进行对比，克服保守思想；同时严格要求规格质量，县、乡、社逐级严格检查，发现不合规格的，及时补救。二、认真做好秧田管理工作，追施速效肥料，培育壮秧。除在秧田发现有虫的要全部彻底消除外，还要普遍进行秧苗消毒。三、抓紧在最近几天内全部送肥下田，灌水沤田，做到三犁三耙，把田整平耙熟，蓄水防旱。四、全面深入检查与验收水利建设工程，防止自满松劲，要作出春耕后继续修建水利工程计划，争取今年内彻底过水利关。五、各社都要立即进行春耕插秧规划。缺秧苗的要当天立即补播。秧苗不壮的立即加强管理。送肥、整田慢的立即突击。为了保证按时插完，要集中70％的劳动力投入春耕。劳动力仍然不足的，要积极提高劳动效率。（附图片）
