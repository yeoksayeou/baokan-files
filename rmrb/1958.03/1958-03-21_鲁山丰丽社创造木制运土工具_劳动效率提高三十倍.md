Lushan Fengli Cooperative Creates Wooden Soil Transport Tools
Labor Efficiency Increased Thirtyfold

(Report from this newspaper) According to the Henan Daily: The Fengli Agricultural Cooperative in Lushan County, led by Henan Province's Special-Class Agricultural Labor Model Wen Xianglan, has created a batch of water conservancy construction tools, solving the problem of insufficient labor in the current water conservancy construction movement.

The Fengli Cooperative is located in a shallow mountainous area, with a total land area of more than 7,400 mu, of which more than 4,500 mu are hillsides. After the county's water conservancy work conference in November last year, the cooperative, after comprehensive planning, determined to build seven reservoirs within one year, convert 300 mu to rice cultivation, and ensure that under a single rainfall of 200 mm, soil does not run down the mountains and water does not flood the plains. According to this requirement, it was calculated that a total of 93,000 workdays were needed. The cooperative has only 530 laborers. Assuming each laborer works every day, working 360 workdays per year, the cooperative can only do 190,800 workdays per year. After deducting 156,000 workdays for agricultural and sideline production throughout 1958, only 34,800 workdays can be invested in mountain and water management projects.

Faced with the difficulties of a large task, tight schedule, and insufficient labor, the Communist Party members and cadres of the Fengli Cooperative, under the leadership and encouragement of Hao Huijiang, the secretary of the CPC branch of the cooperative, and Wen Xianglan, the director of the cooperative, actively studied and tried every means to overcome the difficulties. After many setbacks, they finally successfully trial-produced wooden double-wheeled light soil transport vehicles (as shown in the picture), wooden cranes, wooden rails, and wooden carts for water conservancy construction. These tools are made of wood and a small amount of iron by the cooperative's carpenters. These tools are simple in structure, convenient to use, save money, and are highly efficient. The wooden rail and soil transport vehicle set of tools is more than thirty times more efficient than manual soil carrying under the same conditions. The Dahu Reservoir originally used manual labor to carry soil, with each person carrying an average of 2,258 jin per day, while after using wooden rails and soil transport vehicles, each person transported an average of 70,000 jin per day, 31 times higher than manual carrying. The original plan for this reservoir was to have 75 to 80 laborers working every day, which would take 100 days to complete. Now, with this method, only 39 laborers need to work every day, and it can be completed in 50 days. Due to the successful creation of the tools, the mountain and water management tasks originally planned by the cooperative to be completed within one year can now be completed in half a year. At the same time, it has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm and creativity of the cooperative cadres and the vast number of cooperative members, and has won the support of the vast number of cooperative members. Cooperative member Han Shouren said: "This method is extremely good! It not only saves labor and workdays, but also completes the project quickly and well."

After the Lushan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this creation, Jia Mengfu, the deputy secretary of the County Party Committee, led 252 people, including members of the County Party Committee, secretaries of township party committees, directors of cooperatives, secretaries of cooperative branches, and carpenters, to conduct on-site visits to the cooperative. Comrade Jia Mengfu also represented the Lushan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China in commending the Party members and cooperative cadres of the Fengli Cooperative, as well as the carpenter Liu Tongjian who participated in this creation and invention, and called on everyone to earnestly learn from their spirit of creation and invention. Subsequently, the Lushan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China also adopted various methods to promote the various water conservancy construction tools created by the Fengli Cooperative throughout the county.

    鲁山丰丽社创造木制运土工具
    劳动效率提高三十倍
    本报讯　据河南日报报道：由河南省特等农业劳动模范文香兰领导的鲁山县丰丽农业社，创造一批水利建设工具，解决了当前水利建设运动中劳力不足的困难。
    丰丽社处于浅山地带，全社土地面积七千四百多亩，山坡占四千五百多亩。在去年11月县水利工作会议以后，这个社经过全面规划，确定在一年内修七个水库，改种水稻三百亩，作到在一次降雨二百公厘的情况下，土不下山，水不出川。按照这个要求，据计算共需用工九万三千个。而全社只有劳力五百三十个，按每个劳力日日出勤，全年做三百六十个工计算，全社全年只能做十九万零八百个工，除1958年全年农业和副业生产用工十五万六千个外，这样就只有三万四千八百个工能投入治山治水工程。
    在这样任务大、时间紧、劳力不足的困难面前，丰丽社的共产党员、干部们在中共社支部书记郝惠江、社长文香兰的领导和鼓舞下，积极钻研，千方百计克服困难，经过重重挫折，终于试制成功了木制双轮轻便运土车（如图）、木制起重机、木轨、木车子等水利建设工具。这些工具都是用木头和很少量的铁，由本社木匠造成的。这些工具构造简单、使用便利、省钱、效能又高。木轨和运土车这一套工具，在同样的条件下，效能比原来用人力担土就提高三十余倍。大湖水库原来用人力担土，每人每天平均担二千二百五十八斤，而采用木轨和运土车后，每人每天平均运到七万斤，比人担提高了三十一倍。这个水库原计划每天出勤七十五到八十个劳力，需一百天内完成，现在采用这个办法后，每天只用出勤三十九人，在五十天内即可完成。由于工具的创造成功，该社原规划一年内完成的治山治水任务，现在看来，用半年时间就可全部完成了。同时大大鼓舞了社干和广大社员的积极性和创造性，取得了广大社员的拥护。社员韩守仁说：“这个办法算美极啦！不光省力省工，工程完成的又快又好。”
    中共鲁山县委发现这一创造后，由县委副书记贾孟富同志率领着县委委员、乡党委书记、社长、社支部书记、木匠等二百五十二人，到该社进行了实地参观。贾孟富同志并代表中共鲁山县委表扬了丰丽社的党员和社干，以及参与这一创造发明的木匠刘同建，还号召大家认真学习他们创造发明的精神。随后，中共鲁山县委还采取了各种办法，把丰丽社创造的各种水利建设工具推广到全县。（附图片）
