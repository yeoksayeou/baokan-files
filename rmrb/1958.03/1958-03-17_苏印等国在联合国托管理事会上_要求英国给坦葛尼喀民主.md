Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 14th: The United Nations Trusteeship Council has concluded its discussion on the situation in the Tanganyika Trust Territory in Africa.

Tanganyika was a German colony before World War I and has been under British trusteeship ever since.

During the Trusteeship Council's discussions, close attention was paid to the legislative council elections to be held in some parts of Tanganyika in September this year. The British administration's requirements for voters in terms of property and education deprive 98% of the African population of the right to vote. At the same time, it has adopted an undemocratic system of "parity" representation, which allows non-African residents, who account for only 2% of the total population, to occupy 65% of the seats in the Legislative Council.

During the discussion, the representatives of the Soviet Union, India, Burma, the United Arab Republic, The Hague, and Guatemala emphasized the undemocratic nature of the upcoming elections and firmly demanded that elections be held on the basis of universal suffrage and proportional representation.

In his speech, the Soviet representative, Lobanov, emphasized that many members of the Trusteeship Council, as well as the fact-finding mission to the area, opposed the electoral system imposed on the residents of Tanganyika by the British administration. The local residents are even more firmly opposed to this electoral system.

Lobanov pointed out that the British administration has adopted a colonialist attitude towards the economic development of Tanganyika, which has left Tanganyika's economic development and the lives of its residents at an extremely low level.

Lobanov declared that the Soviet delegation firmly demanded that the British administration strictly abide by the provisions of the United Nations Charter regarding trust territories and a series of resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly on promoting the independence of Tanganyika.

    苏印等国在联合国托管理事会上
    要求英国给坦葛尼喀民主
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社纽约14日讯：联合国托管理事会已经结束了对非洲坦葛尼喀托管地情况的讨论。
    坦葛尼喀在第一次世界大战以前是德国的殖民地，以后一直由英国托管。
    在托管理事会的讨论中，坦葛尼喀将在今年9月在部分地区举行立法会议选举这件事，受到理事国的密切关怀。英国管理当局对选民在财产和教育程度方面的规定剥夺了占该地人口98％的非洲居民的选举权。同时，它又采取了反民主的“对等”代表制度，这就使得只占全部居民2％的非非洲籍居民在立法会议中占据了65％的议席。
    在讨论过程中，苏联、印度、缅甸、阿拉伯联合共和国、海牙和危地马拉的代表强调指出了将要举行的这次选举的不民主性质，并且坚决要求根据普遍选举权的原则和比例代表制举行选举。
    苏联代表洛巴诺夫在发言中强调指出，托管理事会的许多理事国以及到当地去的调查团都反对英国管理当局强加在坦葛尼喀居民身上的选举制度。当地居民更是坚决反对这种选举制度。
    洛巴诺夫指出，英国管理当局对坦葛尼喀经济发展采取了殖民主义的态度，这就使得坦葛尼喀的经济发展和居民生活停留在极低的水平上。
    洛巴诺夫声明，苏联代表团坚决要求英国管理当局严格遵守联合国宪章中有关托管地的规定和联合国大会有关促进坦葛尼喀独立的一系列决议。
