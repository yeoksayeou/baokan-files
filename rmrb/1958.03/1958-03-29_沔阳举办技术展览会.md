Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 28th. During the spring plowing season, Mianyang County, Hubei Province, has been using technical exhibitions to teach techniques to the masses, which has been very well received.

Currently, 41 of the county's 64 townships have set up exhibition halls. All 49 cooperatives in the Huchang district have established such exhibition halls. Cooperative members who have visited and learned from them say: "Learning techniques this way is very clear at a glance." In the Maozui district, 26 district and township cadres originally only knew four or five kinds of grain seeds. After watching and learning at the exhibition hall organized by the CPC County Committee, 22 of them can now grasp the characteristics of 26 kinds of grain seeds. People who didn't know how to use a double-shared plow in paddy fields in the past have also quickly learned how to use it.

    沔阳举办技术展览会
    新华社武汉28日电　湖北省沔阳县各地在春耕中，用举办技术展览馆办法，向群众传授技术，很受欢迎。
    现在，全县六十四个乡已有四十一个乡办了展览馆。胡场区四十九社每个社都办了这种展览馆。前往参观学习的社员们说：用这个办法学技术，真是一目了然。毛咀区有二十六个区、乡干部原来每人只知道四、五种谷种，在中共县委举办的展览馆边看边学后，现在有二十二人能掌握二十六种谷种的特性。过去不会用双铧犁犁水田的人，也很快学会了。
