Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a symposium on the afternoon of March 15th, inviting readers of the "Soviet-Chinese Friendship" magazine.

Readers attending the symposium believed that this Chinese-language publication, founded in January of this year by the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association in the Soviet Union, has contributed to enhancing the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

Li Dequan, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said that the publication of this magazine demonstrates the further development of Sino-Soviet friendship. "'Soviet-Chinese Friendship's" introduction to the happy lives of the Soviet people has inspired the Chinese people's confidence and enthusiasm in building socialism. Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and Secretary-General of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, pointed out that "'Soviet-Chinese Friendship'" provides a comprehensive introduction to the Soviet Union's construction achievements, which are of concern to the Chinese people. It has made great contributions to helping the Chinese people understand the Soviet Union, enhancing Sino-Soviet friendship, and developing Sino-Soviet cooperation.

Xiong Fu, a council member of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, said that the Chinese people should learn the spiritual outlook of the Soviet people. This magazine focuses on introducing this aspect and also introduces the superiority of the Soviet system. These are very beneficial to Chinese readers.

Responsible individuals and representatives from news, publishing, radio, telecommunications, the military, trade unions, women's organizations, youth groups, and other organizations who participated in the symposium, highly praised "'Soviet-Chinese Friendship'" in their speeches and put forward their hopes and suggestions.
