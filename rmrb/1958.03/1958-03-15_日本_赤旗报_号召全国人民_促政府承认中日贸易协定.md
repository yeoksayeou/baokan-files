Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 14th: The "Akahata" published an editorial on the 14th, calling on the Japanese people to strengthen supervision to urge the Japanese government to immediately recognize the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

The editorial pointed out that with the current further economic decline in Japan, expanding trade with China has become an urgent matter. The provision in the agreement for the mutual establishment of non-governmental trade representative offices is of immeasurable significance and can be combined with the clause in the agreement stipulating the conclusion of long-term contracts to become the basis for the rapid development of Sino-Japanese trade.

The "Akahata" pointed out that some right-wing members of the Liberal Democratic Party are taking an attitude of being loyal to the United States and hostile to China, and want to restrict the powers of the trade representative offices. The editorial believes that this is completely contrary to the wishes of the Japanese people. The editorial demands that the Japanese government immediately recognize the Sino-Japanese trade agreement and promote the full implementation of this agreement.

The "Akahata" accused the Japanese government of preparing to revise the laws concerning import and export, attempting to bring Japan's Sino-Japanese trade business under the control of a monopolistic organization. The editorial pointed out that this is a discriminatory treatment against China and a conspiracy to squeeze Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises out of Sino-Japanese trade.

The "Akahata" demands the early conclusion of a trade agreement between the governments of Japan and China, and further urges the early conclusion of agreements between the two governments on fisheries, postal and telecommunications, and cultural exchange.

    日本“赤旗报”号召全国人民
    促政府承认中日贸易协定
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”14日发表社论，号召日本人民加强监督以促使日本政府立即承认第四次日中贸易协定。
    社论指出，在现在日本经济更加衰退，扩大同中国的贸易已经成为目前紧要事情的情况下，在协定中规定互设民间通商代表机构有着不可估量的重大意义，并且能够同协定中规定的缔结长期合同的条文结合起来，成为日中贸易飞跃发展的基础。
    “赤旗报”指出，有一部分自由民主党右派采取忠实于美国而敌视中国的态度，想限制通商代表机构的权限。社论认为这是完全违背日本人民的愿望的。社论要求日本政府立即对日中贸易协定给予承认，并且促使完全执行这个协定。
    “赤旗报”指责，日本政府正在准备修改有关输出入的法律，企图把日本的日中贸易业务统归于一个垄断机关。社论指出，这是对中国的一种差别待遇，并且也是想从日中贸易中挤出日本中小企业的阴谋。
    “赤旗报”要求尽早缔结日、中两国政府间的贸易协定，并且进一步早日缔结两国政府间的渔业、邮电、文化交流等协定。
