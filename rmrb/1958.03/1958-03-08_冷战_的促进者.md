    Promoter of the "Cold War"
    While U.S. Secretary of State Dulles is trying his best to resist the East-West summit conference, Mr. Nutting, the former British Joint Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, has stepped forward to advocate that the West should insist on holding a summit conference. On the surface, this former British diplomat seems to be a promoter of the summit conference.
    However, why should the West insist on holding a summit conference? Nutting's reason is: "In order to prove to the hundreds of millions of people who are tired of the Cold War that the Soviet Union's position has not changed, and that there is no choice but to continue the struggle." It turns out that Mr. Nutting is an enthusiastic lover of the "Cold War"; what he wants to promote is not a summit conference, but the "Cold War" he loves.

    “冷战”的促进者
    当美国国务卿杜勒斯正竭力抵制东西方最高级会议的时候，英国的前协办外交事务国务大臣纳丁挺身而出，主张西方应该坚持举行最高级会议。从表面看来，这位前英国外交家，好像还是一个最高级会议的促进派呢。
    但是，究竟为什么西方应当坚持举行最高级会议呢？纳丁的理由是：“为了向亿万对冷战感到厌倦的人证明，苏联的立场没有改变，除了继续斗争，别无选择余地。”原来纳丁先生是一个“冷战”的热烈爱好者；他所要促进的不是最高级会议，而是他所热爱的“冷战”。
