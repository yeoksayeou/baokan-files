Reports Compiled by Our Newspaper. Damascus "Al-Manar" published a Baghdad dispatch on the 4th, saying that two regiments of the Iraqi army had recently mutinied.

These two regiments, which disobeyed orders, were ordered to enter Jordan and be stationed along the Syrian border. The mutiny took place in the Yakubia Valley area, which is about fifty miles from the Jordanian border within Iraq. They were supported by ten "Fury" fighter planes. As a result, twelve officers were arrested. At the same time, widespread disturbances occurred in some areas of Iraq, resulting in twenty-six civilians killed and fifty injured in clashes with the police.

The report said that security forces armed with submachine guns were patrolling the streets of Baghdad, where several bomb explosions had been heard in the past 48 hours. In some places, demonstrators supporting the United Arab Republic clashed with the police, resulting in many casualties. In some schools, students organized pickets and shouted slogans supporting President Nasser and Kuwatly.

Iraqi officials announced on the 3rd that Prime Minister Mirjan had submitted his resignation to the King. That night, officials announced that Nuri al-Said had formed a new government, serving as Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.

Said is seventy years old. In his early years, he graduated from the Turkish Military Academy and served in the Turkish army. He has served as Iraq's Foreign Minister, Defense Minister, and Prime Minister on several occasions.

Said has close ties with British colonialists. In 1930, he signed the "Anglo-Iraqi Treaty" with Britain, giving territory to Britain as an air force base. The penetration of American forces into Iraq is also inseparable from Said's traitorous activities.

Said is also an active supporter of the Baghdad Pact Organization. The Turkish-Iraqi Treaty signed by the Said government with Turkey in February 1955 was the cornerstone of the Baghdad Pact. In recent years, Said has participated in activities to subvert the Syrian government. Because Said has consistently pursued a policy of relying on imperialism, he has been strongly opposed by the people of Iraq and the Middle East.

At a time when people in various parts of Iraq are holding demonstrations to express their opposition to the Baghdad Pact and the "Eisenhower Doctrine," this cabinet change has attracted widespread attention in Arab countries.

Political leaders and newspapers in Damascus believe that the establishment of the new Iraqi cabinet headed by Nuri al-Said, a notorious imperialist agent, shows that imperialism is intensifying its efforts to control the Iraqi people through its docile pawns by means of terror, and is plotting new conspiracies against the United Arab Republic.

### 伊拉克陆军两团哗变  帝国主义代理人赛义德组成新阁

    伊拉克陆军两团哗变
    帝国主义代理人赛义德组成新阁
    本报综合报道　大马士革“文明报”4日刊载巴格达消息说，伊拉克陆军的两个团最近发生哗变。
    这两个违抗命令的团是在奉命开入约旦在沿叙利亚边境驻防，而在伊拉克境内离约旦边境约五十英里的雅库比亚山谷地区发生哗变的。它们得到十架“愤怒”式战斗机的支持。结果有十二名军官被逮捕。同时，伊拉克的一些地区普遍发生骚动，结果在同警察冲突中有二十六个平民死亡，受伤的达五十人。
    消息说，手持冲锋枪的保安部队在巴格达街上巡逻，在那里，过去四十八小时中听见有好几次炸弹爆炸声。在若干地方，支持阿拉伯联合共和国的游行者同警察发生冲突，有很多人伤亡。在若干学校里，学生们组织了纠察队，并且高呼支持纳赛尔总统和库阿特利的口号。
    伊拉克官方3日宣布，首相米尔詹已经向国王提出辞职。当天晚上，官方又宣布，努里·赛义德组成了新政府。担任首相兼国防大臣。
    赛义德现年七十岁。早年毕业于土耳其军事学校，并曾在土耳其军队中任职。曾经多次担任伊拉克的外交大臣、国防大臣和首相。
    赛义德同英国殖民者有密切关系。1930年他和英国签订了“英伊条约”，把领土送给英国作为空军基地。美国势力能够渗入伊拉克，也是同赛义德的卖国活动分不开的。
    赛义德又是巴格达条约组织的积极支持者。1955年2月，赛义德政府同土耳其签订的土伊条约，便是巴格达条约的垫脚石。近年来，赛义德参与了颠复叙利亚政府的活动。由于赛义德一贯执行投靠帝国主义政策，受到了伊拉克和中东人民的强烈反对。
    正当伊拉克各地人民纷纷举行示威表示反对巴格达条约和“艾森豪威尔主义”的时候，更换内阁这一行动受到阿拉伯国家的广泛注意。
    大马士革政界领袖和报纸认为，以臭名昭彰的帝国主义代理人努里·赛义德为首的伊拉克新内阁的成立，表明帝国主义正在加紧通过它的驯服的走卒用恐怖手段来控制伊拉克人民，并且在策划反对阿拉伯联合共和国的新阴谋。
