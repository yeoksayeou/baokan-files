Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 21st – During the 1958 Fujian Provincial Cycling Championships held from the 15th to the 19th, athletes from Fujian Province broke four national cycling records.

In the men's 10,000-meter cycling final, Lin Tianhua, the creator of the 1955 national record, once again took the lead, breaking the 1957 national record of 16 minutes 4.3 seconds set by People's Liberation Army athlete Qian Huaiyu with a time of 15 minutes 47.2 seconds. In this race, Zhuang Yuguang, Dai Meijiu, Xu Huigen, Yan Chunhua, and Liang Wenhuang, who closely followed Lin Tianhua, also broke the 1957 national record, and all reached the standard of National Master Athlete. Zhuang Yuguang's time was 15 minutes 48.3 seconds, Dai Meijiu's was 15 minutes 52.3 seconds, Xu Huigen's was 15 minutes 52.5 seconds, Yan Chunhua's was 15 minutes 53.2 seconds, and Liang Wenhuang's was 15 minutes 58.2 seconds.

In the men's 5,000-meter cycling final, Zhuang Yuguang won first place with a time of 7 minutes 37.3 seconds. Lin Bingrong took second place with a time of 7 minutes 37.3 seconds. The third place went to Lin Tianhua, with a time of 7 minutes 37.9 seconds. Their times all broke the national record of 7 minutes 53.9 seconds.

The seven male cyclists who broke national records this time are all bicycle workers from Xiamen, Putian, and other places. Because of the combination of labor production and sports activities, their physical strength, endurance, speed, and technique in the competition have all reached a considerable level.

Li Yufeng, the 18-year-old National Master Athlete who broke the women's 1,500-meter cycling national record three times last year, once again broke the national record this time with a time of 2 minutes 32.2 seconds. Female athlete Chen Shaoying also surpassed the national record of 5 minutes 32.7 seconds created by Fu Xiangling in 1957 with a time of 5 minutes 21.9 seconds in the women's 3,000-meter final, reaching the standard of National Master Athlete.

This conference was held in Putian County. The competition was extremely intense. Among the seventy-six cyclists who participated in the competition, in addition to the nine athletes whose scores exceeded four national records, there were also seven athletes whose scores broke all (six) Fujian provincial cycling records, ten athletes whose scores reached the National Master Athlete standard, and twenty-three athletes whose scores reached the National First-Class Athlete standard.

    新华社福州21日电　在15日到19日举行的1958年福建省自行车锦标赛大会上，福建省的运动员们打破了四项自行车全国纪录。
    在男子一万公尺自行车决赛中，1955年全国纪录创造者林天华又一马当先，以十五分四十七秒二的成绩，打破了解放军运动员钱怀玉所创造的1957年十六分四秒三的全国纪录。在这场比赛中，紧跟着林天华的庄玉光、代妹九、徐惠根、严春华和梁文煌等五个运动员的成绩也都打破了1957年全国纪录，并且全部达到国家运动健将的标准。庄玉光的成绩是十五分四十八秒三，代妹九十五分五十二秒三，徐惠根十五分五十二秒五，严春华十五分五十三秒二，梁文煌十五分五十八秒二。
    在男子五千公尺自行车决赛中，庄玉光以七分三十七秒三的成绩获得了第一名。林炳荣以七分三十七秒三的成绩获得第二名。第三名是林天华，他的成绩是七分三十七秒九。他们的成绩都打破了七分五十三秒九的全国纪录。
    这次打破全国纪录的七个自行车男运动员，都是厦门、莆田等地的自行车工人，他们由于劳动生产和体育活动相结合，在比赛中的体力、耐力、速度和技术等都达到相当高的水平。
    去年曾接连三次打破女子一千五百公尺自行车全国纪录的十八岁的国家运动健将李玉凤，这次又以二分三十二秒二的成绩，打破了全国纪录。女运动员陈绍英在女子三千公尺决赛中，也以五分二十一秒九的成绩，超过了傅湘苓1957年创造的五分三十二秒七的全国纪录，达到国家运动健将标准。
    这次大会在莆田县举行。竞赛情况极为紧张。参加比赛的七十六个自行车运动员中，除了有九个运动员的成绩超过四项全国纪录外，还有七个运动员的成绩打破了福建省自行车运动的全部（六项）纪录，有十名运动员的成绩达到了国家运动健将标准，有二十三个运动员的成绩达到了国家一级运动员的标准。
