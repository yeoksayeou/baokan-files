Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, March 22nd: The Tangshan Rolling Stock Plant set a new national record on the 20th by overhauling a locomotive in four days. This is the third time it has broken the national record for the production cycle of locomotive overhauls. The first time was on March 5th, when it overhauled a locomotive in six days; immediately afterwards, it overhauled another locomotive in five days on the 13th.
    However, both new records were quickly matched by brother factories, and the second new record lasted only two days. On the 20th, leading cadres and technical personnel from various workshops went deep into the field in shifts, grasped the main processes and weak links in production, and studied with the workers to break many established rules in process operation, finally creating a new record again.

    唐山三创中修机车新纪录
    据新华社保定22日电  唐山机车车辆修理厂20日又创造了四天中修一台机车的全国新纪录。这是它第三次刷新全国中修机车生产周期的新纪录。第一次是3月5日，用六天中修一台机车；紧接着，又在13日用五天中修了一台机车。
    但是两次新纪录都很快被兄弟工厂赶上了，第二次的新纪录仅仅保持了两天。20日，各车间领导干部和技术人员分班深入现场，抓住生产中的主要工序和薄弱环节，同工人一起研究，打破多项工艺操作上的陈规，终于又创新纪录。
