Taiyuan, March 30th (This newspaper dispatch) – In the anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement, construction workers Shen Xikai, Yu Changbo, Chi Hongen, He Yongming, and others at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant expansion site proposed that everyone should learn to be a "jack-of-all-trades" and that one machine should perform multiple operations. This initiative immediately received strong support from leaders at all levels and enthusiastic response from the vast majority of workers. Construction workers are striving to become "jack-of-all-trades" within six months.

To have everyone learn to be a "jack-of-all-trades" and to have one machine perform multiple operations means that every worker should master two, three, or even six or seven operational skills, and that every construction machine should become a "universal" machine, performing two, three, or even four or five or more operations. This is a major technical reform. Currently, most workers in general construction teams only know one skill; bricklayers do not know how to plaster, and those who install doors and windows do not know how to pour concrete. Due to the limitations of single operations, labor shortages often occur on one side while a large amount of work is idled on the other, resulting in work stoppages for three or four months a year. According to the person in charge of this construction site, after realizing the "jack-of-all-trades" technique, the phenomenon of idle work and waste can be fundamentally overcome, and labor efficiency can be increased by more than 40%. After realizing multiple operations for one machine, the potential of machinery and equipment can be fully utilized, greatly increasing the degree of mechanized construction.

Currently, more than 2,400 workers at this construction site have learned two or more skills, and some machines are already performing six or seven different operations. If this measure is fully promoted, they can increase the degree of mechanization to over 85% this year without increasing machinery and equipment (the degree of mechanization was less than 50% last year). Combining the effects of these two measures, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant expansion project can reduce the need to hire four or five thousand contract workers.

Shen Xikai, the initiator of the "jack-of-all-trades" concept, is a famous labor model. The construction team he leads has now become a "four-skill team," and he and his son have become "six-skill experts." Because they have mastered multiple skills and improved labor efficiency, they completed the construction tasks of the First Five-Year Plan one year and four months ahead of schedule. Recently, they put forward the slogan of completing the annual task in eight months, aiming to have each member of the team complete 1,000 yuan worth of work per month, taking the lead nationwide.

### 太原钢铁厂建筑工人学习多种技术  人人争取成为“多面手”

    太原钢铁厂建筑工人学习多种技术
    人人争取成为“多面手”
    本报太原30日电　在反浪费、反保守运动中，太原钢铁厂扩建工地建筑工人沈锡凯、于长波、迟宏恩、何永铭等提出了人人学会“多面手”、一种机器进行多种作业的倡议。这一倡议立即得到了有关各级领导的大力支持和广大工人的热烈响应。建筑工人们争取在半年内都成为“多面手”。
    人人学会“多面手”和一种机器进行多种作业，就是要让每个工人都掌握两手、三手以至六、七手的操作技术，让每种施工机械都能变成“万能”机械，进行两种、三种以至四、五种以上的作业。这是一项重大的技术改革。现在一般建筑工程队的工人，大都只会一种技术，砌砖的就不会抹灰，上门窗的不会浇混凝土，由于单一操作的限制，工程中经常发生一边人力不够，一边大量窝工，一年停工达三四个月之久。据这个工地的负责人说，实现人人学会“多面手”技术以后，可以从根本上克服窝工浪费现象，劳动效率可以提高40％以上。实现一种机械进行多种作业以后，可以充分发挥机器设备的潜力，大大提高机械化施工的程度。
    现在，这个工地已经有二千四百多名工人学会了两手以上的技术，有的机器已经在进行着六、七种不同的作业。如果全面推广这一措施，他们今年就可以在不增加机器设备的情况下，使机械化程度提高到85％以上（去年机械化程度不足50％）。把这两项措施产生的效果加在一起，太原钢铁厂扩建工程就可以少招雇合同工人四五千名。
    “多面手”倡议者沈锡凯是一个著名的劳动模范。他领导的施工队，现在已经学成了“四面手”，他和他的儿子都成了“六面手”。他们由于掌握了多种技术，提高了劳动效率，结果提前一年又四个月完成了第一个五年计划的施工任务。最近，他们又提出了八个月完成全年任务的口号，要使全队每人每月完成的工作量达到一千元，在全国领先。
