Everyone Sorts, Everyone Debates, Everyone Solves
The Ministry of Machine Building's Method for Quickly Handling Big-Character Posters Is Good
Find the "Key Points" for Debate and Rectification from Over 900,000 Big-Character Posters

(Our Dispatch) The First Ministry of Machine Building adopted the mass line method of "Everyone Sorts, Everyone Debates, Everyone Solves" to handle the sea of big-character posters. This not only greatly accelerated the processing of over 900,000 big-character posters but also made full preparations for the upcoming special debates.

Facing the Vast Ocean of Big-Character Posters, How to Proceed? We Must Find the "Key Points"!

During the Double-Anti Movement, a total of over 900,000 big-character posters were put up in this ministry. The problems revealed by the big-character posters were numerous and widespread. Faced with so many big-character posters and so many problems, the leadership of some units felt overwhelmed and did not know where to start. Some said, "We are drowned in the ocean of big-character posters," and others said, "So many problems make me feel like I'm in a maze, I really don't know what to do!"

After discovering this problem, the ministry's leadership felt that although waste, conservatism, and the "three winds and five airs" were exposed relatively thoroughly, if we only destroy and do not build, the bright spring would be wasted, and the enthusiasm of the masses would be frustrated, and the purpose of the "Double-Anti" Movement could not be achieved. Therefore, the most urgent problem to be solved at that time was to quickly lead the masses to find the "key points" from the vast ocean of big-character posters.

The One Who Tied the Bell Must Untie It: The Sales Bureau and the First Design Institute Fully Relied on the Masses to Quickly Handle the Big-Character Posters and Find the "Key Points"

They then mobilized everyone to discuss and exchanged situations and experiences at the rectification leadership group meetings of the ministry's subordinate units. The leadership discovered that the Sales Bureau and the First Design Institute had created good methods for finding the "key points" and sorting out and solving the big-character posters. The Sales Bureau adopted a method of combining leadership from top to bottom and then from bottom to top with the masses. The director of this bureau and the director of the rectification office had long included "personally reading the big-character posters" in their work agenda. Every afternoon after starting work, they made sure to go to the scene to read the big-character posters for an hour. In this way, the leadership had a "bottom line" in mind regarding the problems revealed in the big-character posters. These "bottom lines" were the "seeds" of the later "key points." When the upsurge of airing opinions began, the leadership studied and analyzed the "bottom lines" they had usually touched and formulated 40 "preliminary key points" for improving sales work. They wrote them out one by one in the form of big-character posters and "threw" them out (that is, "throwing out the key points"). Because these "key points" truly concentrated the main opinions on the big-character posters, the masses were very interested. Some departments and sections concretized these "key points" and formulated "key points" for handling them, and the "key points" for the sections. Many people put forward supplementary and revised opinions on the "key points" thrown out by the bureau's leadership in the form of big-character posters. The leadership then concentrated these opinions and, after this repeated process of up and down, down and up, established relatively perfect "key points."

The First Design Institute adopted a method of combining leadership from bottom to top and then from top to bottom with the masses. This institute put up a total of more than 70,000 big-character posters during the airing of opinions. Their specific method for finding the "key points" was to "rely on the masses to classify and select the best" and to "establish opposites, argue, rectify, and establish key points while learning from one example to infer others." In this way, they combined mass debates, rectification, and "discussing key points" and "establishing key points." The slogan they put forward was "The one who tied the bell must untie it," "Everyone is the commander of the big-character posters," and "The big-character posters written by everyone, sorted by everyone, debated by everyone, and solved by everyone." The enthusiasm of the masses was even higher, using the more than 70,000 big-character posters as weapons for debate, boldly setting up "battlefields." What category did the big-character posters they put up belong to? What did they advocate? What did they oppose? They found the "battlefield" themselves and dispatched it themselves. In three days, the entire institute set up 80 battlefields, and more than 70,000 big-character posters quickly recognized their relatives and returned to their teams. In order to make the problem more focused, the leadership again called on the masses to "select the best." Each comrade put forward what they considered the most important big-character posters. In this way, some trivial matters were transformed into "watermelons" after the masses "selected the best." For example, the Party, Labor Union, Youth League, and the office previously argued about the waste of badminton and rackets, and had been entangled in how much money was wasted. After the masses "selected the best," the problem became focused, and the main key was found: "Why is the work not thorough? Why can't we grasp the mainstream?" The leadership compared these problems that had been "selected the best" by the masses with the "watermelons" that the leadership had grasped in the past, and quickly found the more important key problems, and then guided the masses to start debates on these problems. In this way, the problems became clear, and the "key points" were also thrown out. After debating the issue of "quality and speed," one section established a key point: without increasing manpower or material resources, the design speed should be doubled, and three years of work could be completed in one year.

After the Advanced Experience of the Two Units Was Promoted, the Entire Ministry Quickly Formed a Mass Movement of "Throwing Out Key Points," "Discussing Key Points," and "Establishing Key Points"

After discovering the advanced experience of these two units, the ministry's rectification leadership group immediately analyzed, studied, and improved it, and put forward a relatively complete working method: that is, combining leadership with the masses and adopting the method of "throwing out key points, discussing key points, and establishing key points" to find the "key points" and promote a great leap forward in production and construction. At the same time, it held four on-site meetings in these two advanced units one after another to introduce advanced experience. After the meeting, in many units, a mass movement of "throwing out key points," "discussing key points," and "establishing key points" quickly formed. The Finance Section of the Second Bureau adopted the method of leadership responsibility, everyone participating, and layer-by-layer promotion. From tens of thousands of big-character posters, it quickly found that the key problems of this section were three deficiencies: lack of politics, lack of reality, and lack of economic responsibility; three absences: no investigation and research, no analysis, and no arrangement; therefore, the bureaucracy and stagnation in the past work were serious; the work relied on three things: official documents, rules and regulations, and instructions from superiors; and three busy things: busy with final accounts, busy with official documents, and busy with plans. Now, the leadership has already "thrown out" the "key points" for improving their work based on these problems and handed them over to the masses for discussion. Units that originally thought that big-character posters were like an ocean and there was no way to grasp the problems and could only "sigh at the ocean" have now also "thrown out" "preliminary key points."

Now, the leadership of the First Ministry of Machine Building has also "thrown out" four "key points" based on the leadership's intentions, combined with the "key points" "thrown out" by subordinate units: "Long-Term Plans," "Capital Construction," Annual Plans, and Technical Work. Recently, they will also "throw out" three "key points" such as achieving both Redness and Expertise; reforming rules and regulations and improving working methods. An upsurge in discussing "key points" is about to unfold in all units of the entire ministry.

    大家整理　大家辩论　大家解决
    一机部迅速处理大字报的办法好
    从九十多万张大字报中找出辩论和整改的“纲”来
    本报讯　第一机械工业部采取“大家整理，大家辩论，大家解决”的群众路线的方法处理汪洋大海似的大字报，不但大大加快了九十多万张大字报的处理速度，而且为即将展开的专题辩论作好充分的准备。
    面对着汪洋大海似的大字报怎么办？必须找出“纲”来
    这个部在双反运动中，一共贴出了九十多万张大字报，大字报揭发的问题又多、又广。面对这样多的大字报，这样多的问题，有些单位领导上感到千头万绪，不知抓那一头好？有人说：“被淹在大字报的海洋里了”，还有人说：“那样多的问题，弄得我如入迷魂阵一样，真不知如何是好？”
    部领导上在发现这个问题以后，感到：浪费、保守、三风五气虽然揭发得比较透了，但是，如果破而不立，就会满院春光，付之东流，群众的积极性受到挫折“双反”的目的不能实现。因此，那时候最迫切需要解决的一个问题，就是迅速领导群众，从一片汪洋大海似的大字报里找出“纲”来。
    解铃还须系铃人，销售局和第一设计院充分依靠群众迅速处理了大字报并找出了“纲”
    他们就发动大家来讨论，在部属各单位整风领导小组会议上，互相交流情况和经验，领导上发现了销售局和第一设计院创造了找“纲”的和整理解决大字报的好办法。销售局采取由上而下，然后再由下而上的领导与群众相结合的办法。这个局的局长和整风办公室主任早就把“亲自看大字报”订入自己的工作日程中去，每天下午一上班，一定要亲赴现场看一个钟头的大字报，这样，领导上对于大字报上所揭发的问题，心中有了“底”，这些“底”也就是后来“纲”的“种子”。当鸣放高潮起来以后，领导上就将平时摸到的“底”加以研究分析，制订出改进销售工作的“初纲”四十条，利用大字报的形式，逐条地写出来，“抛”出去，（即“抛纲”）因为这些“纲”确实集中了大字报上的主要意见，所以群众很感兴趣，有的处、科把这些“纲”具体化了，订出了处理的“纲”，科里的“纲”，许多人以大字报的形式对局领导上抛出的“纲”提出补充、修正意见，领导上再把这些意见集中上来，经过这样上来下去，下去上来的反复过程，就立出了比较完善的“纲”。
    第一设计院是采取由下而上，然后由上而下的领导与群众相结合的办法，这个院在鸣、放中，一共贴了七万多张大字报，他们找“纲”的具体办法是“依靠群众自己分类拔尖”“树立对立面，边争、边改、边立纲，举一反三”，这样，就将群众性的辩论、整改和“论纲”、“立纲”结合起来了，他们提出来的口号是“解铃还须系铃人”，“人人都做大字报的司令员”“大家写的大字报，大家整理，大家辩论，大家解决”。群众的热情更加高涨，把七万多张大字报作为争辩的武器，放手摆“战场”，自己贴的大字报，究竟是那一类的？是提倡什么？反对什么？由自己找“战场”，自己调遣，三天中，全院就摆出了八十个战场、七万多张大字报很快认了亲、归了队。为了使问题更加集中，领导上又号召群众“拔尖”，每个同志把自己认为最重要的大字报提出来，这样，原来一些芝麻琐碎的事情，经过群众一“拔尖”，都成了“西瓜”，如党、工、团、办公室，以前争辩羽毛球、球拍的浪费，一直纠缠在浪费多少钱上，经过群众“拔尖”，问题一集中，就找到了主要关键是：“工作为什么不深入？为什么抓不住主流？”领导上把这些经过群众“拔尖”的问题和领导上自己过去掌握的“西瓜”一对照，就迅速地找出了比较重大的关键问题，然后再引导群众对这些问题展开辩论，这样，问题明确了“纲”也抛出来了。有一个科在辩论了“质量与速度”问题以后，立了一条纲：在不增加人力、物力的情况下，设计速度加快一倍，三年的工作可以一年做完。
    两个单位的先进经验推广以后，全部迅速形成了“抛纲”“论纲”“立纲”的群众性运动
    部整风领导小组在发现这二个单位的先进经验以后，立即作了分析、研究、提高，并提出了一条比较完整的工作方法：即领导与群众相结合，采取“抛纲、论纲、立纲”的办法，找出“纲”来，推动生产建设大跃进。同时又在这二个先进单位先后开了四次现场会议，介绍了先进经验，会后，在许多单位，迅速形成了“抛纲”、“论纲”、“立纲”的群众性运动。二局财务处采取领导负责、大家动手、层层推动的办法，从几万张大字报中，迅速找出这个处的关键问题是三缺：缺政治、缺实际、缺经济责任；三无：无调查研究、无分析、无安排，因而过去工作中官风、暮气严重；工作上是三靠：靠公文、靠规章制度、靠上级指示；三忙：忙决算，忙公文、忙计划。现在，领导上已根据这些问题，“抛”出了他们改进工作的“纲”，交群众讨论。原来认为大字报像海洋一样，没有办法抓问题，只能“望洋兴叹”的单位，现在也“抛”出了“初纲”。
    现在，第一机械工业部领导上也已经根据领导意图，结合所属单位“抛”出来的“纲”，“抛”出了“长远计划”、“基本建设”、年度计划和技术工作四条“纲”，最近还要抛出实现又红又专；改革规章制度和改进工作方法等三条“纲”。一个论“纲”的高潮即将在全部各个单位展开。
