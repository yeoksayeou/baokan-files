Distinguishing Between Two Roads Is of Decisive Significance
Liu Xianzhou, Vice President of Tsinghua University

As a result of pursuing the bourgeois individualistic and theoretically divorced-from-practice scientific research path, the scientific research work of many teachers has gone astray.

Some people do not cooperate with each other in their work, and even if they do cooperate, they must first determine the order of authorship when publishing papers. Assistants are hired to assist with work, but some keep their work intentions "secret" from their assistants. Sometimes, it even develops into academic monopoly; when new books and materials arrive at the school, some people borrow them home and lock them in their rooms. One professor, for six years, except for one semester when he supervised the architectural designs of fifteen students, consistently refused to undertake teaching work, because he was afraid that "the results of his hard-earned research would be overheard!" He was also unwilling to participate in discussion meetings, fearing that "he would inadvertently reveal his knowledge when speaking!" When lecturing on important points, he would sometimes cover his mouth with his hand, regretting that he had "said too much." Once, when other teachers went to his house and he was not home, they moved something on his desk. Afterwards, he scolded his wife severely for not protecting him well, calling her "not even as good as a watchdog!" Some papers should have experimental data, but they are actually based on conjecture, or based on some rough results and subjective selection.

Two professors, whose work results were of no value, revealed the following when criticizing each other:

A: "I know your tricks. Your articles are incomprehensible to outsiders, and those in the know find them insignificant. It's all for the sake of a few bucks."

B: "Money is a good thing, indispensable, but not too much. It can improve life, increase efficiency, and benefit socialism. Don't talk about me; aren't we the same? The difference between you and me is: I use the money to buy things, and you put the money in the bank."

A lecturer, in order to become famous in one fell swoop, fancifully requested the school to grant him a year's leave to conduct research on an "underground boat," wanting to "use ultrasonic waves to tunnel through the Earth to the United States."

Under the guidance of such a serious pursuit of fame and profit, how can we expect scientific research to produce good results? ...

We feel that distinguishing between the fundamental differences between the two roads in scientific research is of decisive significance to the future of scientific research. The capitalist road and its influence exist quite extensively, causing a huge waste of manpower and material resources. If it is not thoroughly criticized, no matter how good the working conditions the state gives us, no matter how hard the Soviet Union tries to help us, it is difficult to imagine that the Twelve-Year Plan can be completed.

    辨明两条道路有决定性意义
    清华大学副校长　刘仙洲
    由于追求资产阶级个人主义的、理论脱离实际的科学研究道路的结果，不少教师的科学研究工作走入了歧途。
    有的人在工作中彼此不合作，即使合作了，也要先定好发表论文时的名次。要助手，本来为的是协助工作，但是有的却把工作意图对助手“保密”。有时甚至发展到学术垄断，学校新的图书资料一到，有人就借回家去锁在自己的房里。有一位教授，六年以来他除了有一学期指导过十五个学生的建筑设计以外，始终拒绝担任教学工作，原因是怕“自己辛辛苦苦研究得到的成果被人听去了”！他也不肯参加讨论会，恐怕“发言的时候情不自禁地把学问泄漏出去”！讲书讲到紧要的地方，有时就用手把嘴遮住，恨自己“说的太多了”。有一次别的教师到他家里去，他没有在家，翻动了一下他桌上的东西，他事后竟大骂他的妻子，没有给他保护好，骂她“连看家狗也不如”！有的论文应该有实验数据，但实际上是假想的，或根据一些粗糙的结果加以主观的选择而成的。
    有两位教授，他们的工作结果都没有什么价值，在互相批评的时候，彼此的揭发说——
    甲：“我知道你那一套，你的文章，外行看不懂，内行看了觉得没有什么，只是为了几个钱。”
    乙：“钱是好东西，不可少，也不要很多。它可以改善生活，提高效率，对社会主义有好处。你不用说我，我们还不是一样？你我的差别在于：我有了钱买东西，你有了钱存银行就是。”
    有一位讲师为了想一举成名，异想天开地要求学校给假一年，去作“地下之舟”的研究，想“利用超声波打通地球通到美国去”。
    在这种严重的名利思想的指导之下，我们如何能期望科学研究作出好的结果来呢？…………
    我们感到辨明科学研究工作中两条道路的根本分歧对科学研究的前途实在有决定性的意义。资本主义道路和它的影响相当广泛地存在，造成了人力物力巨大的浪费；如果不加以彻底批判，不管国家给我们怎样好的工作条件，不管苏联怎样努力帮助我们，十二年规划是很难设想能够完成的。
