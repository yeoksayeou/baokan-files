	Finding Politics Through Economics
	Examining Ideology Beyond Production
	Our Tianjin Correspondent
	In the process of the extensive, in-depth, and rapid development of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign at the Tianjin Enamel Factory, jointly owned by public and private interests, three main experiences were gained.

	Leadership Showing Sincerity
		Resolutely Drawing Fire Upon Themselves
	In the early stages of launching the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign in the factory, the factory director, Wang Cun, spent several days writing seventy anti-waste proposals, making a preliminary calculation of waste, and submitted them to all factory workers for discussion. However, the workers spoke very little at the discussion meetings and did not expose many problems. In one evening, all seventy articles were read, and then returned as they were, without solving any problems. This greatly surprised the leading cadres. Why, during the period of great blooming and contending, did the workers quickly put up more than 10,000 big-character posters, while this time it was so quiet? So, they organized
cadres to conduct ideological investigation, and found that workers had many concerns. Some middle-level cadres were afraid of being held responsible after the anti-waste campaign. Some workers were also afraid of being held responsible and unwilling to expose waste phenomena. Some young workers were worried that giving opinions to veteran workers would affect the relationship between teachers and apprentices. A small number of workers with poor labor discipline were even more afraid of others finding "trouble" with them.

	After analyzing the various concerns of the masses, the leading cadres realized that this anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign was different from the great blooming and contending during the rectification movement. At that time, the great blooming and contending were mainly to give opinions to the leadership, and the masses had fewer concerns. Waste phenomena are related to many people, so workers have more concerns when exposing them. Most leading cadres believed that they should take the lead in self-criticism. However, a few leading cadres disagreed. They believed that poor product quality was caused by workers' low awareness and poor labor discipline. This view was resolutely opposed by the majority of leading cadres. They argued that the leading cadres' emphasis on output and neglect of quality was the main reason for the waste. The factory's output value targets could not be completed, and the leading cadres were anxious, but the quality had not improved for a long time, and everyone was not very concerned. This erroneous thinking of the leading cadres affected the factory's management methods and the work style of the cadres, and also prompted workers to simply pursue output. These two different opinions were debated continuously for two days in the factory's general branch committee of the Communist Party. Finally, after investigation and research, it was proven that the vast majority of workers urgently demanded improvement in product quality, and that only a small number of workers did not comply with labor discipline.

	After this debate, the leading cadres further realized that poor quality and high waste were violations of the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, related to the life and death of the factory, and deeply felt their great responsibility. They were determined to sincerely draw fire upon themselves. The factory director and the secretary of the general branch of the Communist Party first made self-criticisms in front of the masses, and took the lead in exposing twenty-two instances of waste caused by the leading cadres' bureaucracy, subjectivism, unfamiliarity with business, and failure to rely on the masses, breaking the masses' concerns and igniting the fire of anti-waste and anti-conservatism. They also once again explained the significance of anti-waste to the workers, held a waste product exhibition in the factory, invited staff from the trade department to the factory to have discussions with the workers, and organized workers from various workshops to visit each other and give opinions. Within a few days, the fire of anti-waste and anti-conservatism spread to every corner, and the workers put up more than two thousand big-character posters. Some workers held meetings until late at night after work, and then wrote big-character posters after the meeting.

	Calculating Economic Accounts
		Also Calculating Ideological Accounts
	After a large number of waste facts were exposed, the leading cadres of this factory believed that it was necessary to further expose the ideological roots of waste and improve the socialist consciousness of the leading cadres and all workers in order to deepen the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign and ensure the results of the campaign. They first analyzed and synthesized the waste facts, and made an ideological self-criticism at the general meeting of all workers. They examined that the ideological roots of waste were: capitalist management thinking of aiming too high, pursuing quantity and novelty, and blindly purchasing; bureaucracy, irresponsibility towards state property, and the wasteful style of "with such a big family and business, a little waste doesn't matter."

	The self-criticism of the leading cadres moved the middle-level cadres and workers. Many middle-level cadres saw that the leading cadres took the responsibility for poor quality and high waste upon themselves, and changed their past irresponsible attitude of pushing responsibility upwards and downwards, and the phenomenon of vying for responsibility and competing for self-criticism appeared. Section chiefs, branch factory directors, and workshop directors all humbly examined their own thoughts in front of the masses. Dong Jianzhong, director of the Second Workshop, who had previously believed that "waste is the responsibility of the factory director and workers, and has nothing to do with me," also examined his erroneous thinking of being afraid of taking responsibility this time. Many workers, hearing the self-criticism of the leading cadres, also felt that they had not fulfilled their responsibility to state property. They said: "The factory wastes, the leadership is responsible, but the waste flows out from our hands!"

	When many workers examined the ideological reasons for their carelessness in operation that caused poor quality, a few workers believed that the waste was caused by the leadership, and the workers were not responsible. Therefore, a great debate on the sense of ownership of the working class was launched among the workers.

	When the workers of the lampshade team in the Second Workshop discussed the phenomenon of wasting working hours, some workers proposed: "We leave work early because the quota is low and the task is completed. The responsibility lies with the leadership." At that time, many workers refuted this statement. They said: The leadership is responsible for the low quota and failure to revise it in time, but the working class is the master of the factory. Why didn't they raise suggestions to revise it when the quota was low? The leadership has shortcomings, and the leadership makes self-criticism; we should also examine our own shortcomings. When the workers of the Fourth Team of the Second Workshop discussed the reasons for the poor product quality that caused waste, the young worker Hu Wenhua said: "The factory's quality cannot be improved because there is no quality award." Many workers immediately debated with him. Some said that even without a quality award, the workers of the First Team and the Eleventh Team improved their operating skills and cooperated closely, resulting in the grade A and grade B products reaching more than 80%. Some workers asked Hu Wenhua: In the past, the factory also had quality awards, but the quality did not improve; now, without quality awards, the quality has improved instead. Why? Some workers also exposed the facts that Hu Wenhua and themselves did not pay attention to operation and rushed for output, resulting in poor quality, and established a correct understanding. After repeated debates, everyone realized the relationship between personal interests and national interests. A competition to compare with the advanced, compare contributions, and overcome waste was widely launched among the workers. The workers of the Second Workshop also formulated a covenant for observing labor discipline, and at the same time made demands on the workshop leaders and department cadres. Technicians also actively took action and worked with the workers to trial-produce more than twenty new products.

	Cadres Going Deep into the Masses
		Breathing the Same Air as the Workers
	From the beginning of this anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League leading cadres of the factory went deep into the groups and bloomed and contended with the workers. After a large amount of waste was exposed, the leading cadres summarized nineteen key issues and organized workers of relevant types of work into twenty-one professional groups, led by leading cadres to participate and rectify together. Administrative leading cadres went deep into the grassroots and worked with the workers to formulate quota-based material requisition and responsibility systems, as well as regulations and rules such as process operation procedures for various types of work.

	Leading cadres going deep into production and solved many key problems in a timely manner. For example, the workers of the art spraying team proposed to change the past small-scale flow spraying method to single-person operation, so that each shift could increase from only four patterns to twenty-eight. In this way, the number of spray guns needed by each person would increase a lot, but the operating area was not enough. Zhang Jian, the secretary of the general branch of the Communist Party who participated in the art team's work, worked with the workers to research and come up with measures to change the single-layer spray gun rack to a double-layer one. If the workers didn't know how to do it, he consulted with veteran carpenters, made a sample in the afternoon, and immediately promoted it after the trial was successful. Wu Guang, the branch secretary of the Second Workshop, changed his style of rarely contacting workers this time and worked with the workers to use titanium oxide instead of antimony oxide to enamel basins in order to improve quality. This is a high-grade porcelain glaze rarely produced domestically, requiring extremely strict requirements and very complicated operations. In the past, workers had failed several experiments. Seeing him personally conducting experiments, the workers said: "Wu Guang has taken action, how can we not catch up." Many workers asked to participate in the experiment. Wu Guang selected seven veteran workers from among them, fought for four days and nights, overcame seven difficulties, and finally succeeded in trial-producing it, bringing the quality of this batch of new products up to international standards.

	After the leading cadres improved their leadership style, they further encouraged the workers' revolutionary spirit. In less than half a month, they implemented twenty-eight of the factory's forty-eight saving measures. Preliminary calculations show that more than 90,000 yuan can be saved.

    透过经济找政治
    跳出生产查思想
    本报驻天津记者
    公私合营天津搪瓷厂在反浪费、反保守运动广泛、深入、迅速发展的过程中，取得了三条主要的经验。
      领导推诚相见
        坚决引火烧身
    在工厂开展反浪费、反保守运动的初期，厂长王存花了几天的功夫，写了七十条反浪费的提纲，初步算了一笔浪费账，交给全厂职工进行讨论。可是，职工们在讨论会上发言很少，揭发问题也不多，在一个晚上，就把七十条都念完了，又照样交回来，什么问题也没有解决。这使领导干部大为惊讶。为什么在大鸣大放期间，职工们很快就贴出了一万多张大字报，而这次却如此冷冷清清呢？于是，他们组织
  干部进行思想摸底，发现职工有很多顾虑。有些中层干部怕反浪费后追责任，追到自己头上来。部分工人也怕追责任，不愿意揭发浪费现象。有些青年工人顾虑给老师傅提出意见后，会影响师徒关系。少数劳动纪律不好的工人，更怕别人找他的“麻烦”。
    经过分析群众中的各种顾虑，领导干部们认识到：这次开展反浪费、反保守运动，和整风初期发动职工大鸣大放不一样。那时大鸣大放主要是给领导提意见，群众顾虑较少；而浪费现象同很多人有关，因此职工揭发起来顾虑较多。多数领导干部认为应该带头首先检讨。但是少数领导干部不同意。他们认为：产品质量不好是工人觉悟低、劳动纪律不好造成的。这种看法遭到多数领导干部的坚决反对。他们提出领导干部重产量轻质量的思想是造成浪费主要原因。工厂的产值指标完不成计划，领导干部都着急，质量长期没有提高，大家并不十分关心。领导干部这种错误思想，影响着工厂的经营管理方法和干部作风，也促使工人单纯追求产量。这两种不同的意见，在这个厂中共总支委员会上连续争辩了两天。最后经过调查研究证明：绝大多数工人迫切要求改善产品质量，不遵守劳动纪律的工人是少数的。
    经过这次辩论，领导干部们进一步认识到质量次、浪费大，是违反勤俭办企业的方针、关系到工厂生死存亡的问题，深感自己责任重大，下决心要以诚恳的态度引火烧身。厂长和中共总支书记首先在群众面前做了检查，并且带头揭发出由于领导干部官僚主义、主观主义，不熟悉业务，不依靠群众所造成的二十二项浪费事实，打破了群众顾虑，点起了反浪费、反保守的大火。他们还再一次向工人讲解了反浪费的意义，在厂内举办了废品展览会，请贸易部门的工作人员来厂和工人一起座谈，组织各车间的工人互相访问，提意见。几天之内，反浪费、反保守的大火就烧遍了各个角落，职工们贴出大字报二千多张。有的工人下班以后开会到深夜，会后又写了大字报。
      既算经济账
        又算思想账
    这个厂的领导干部在浪费事实大量揭发出来以后，认为必须进一步揭发造成浪费的思想根源，提高领导干部和全体职工的社会主义觉悟，才能使反浪费、反保守运动深入开展起来，并且保证运动的成果。他们首先分析、综合了浪费事实，在全体职工大会上做了思想检查。他们检查出造成浪费的思想根源是：好高骛远、贪大求新、盲目采购的资本主义经营思想；官僚主义，对国家财产不负责任，存在“家大业大、浪费点不算什么”的大少爷作风。
    领导干部的检查感动了中层干部和工人们。许多中层干部看到领导干部把质量次、浪费大的责任兜在自己身上，就改变了过去上推下卸的不负责任的态度，出现了抢责任、争检查的现象。科长、分厂厂长、车间主任都在群众面前虚心地检查了自己的思想。过去曾认为“浪费是厂长和工人的责任，与我无关”的第二车间主任董建中，这次也检查了自己怕负责任的错误思想。许多工人听到领导干部的检查，也感到自己对国家财产没有尽到责任。他们说：“工厂浪费，领导有责任，可是浪费是从我们手里流出去的呀！”
    当许多工人检查自己不注意操作造成质量低劣的思想原因时，也有少数工人认为浪费是领导方面造成的，工人没有责任。于是，在工人中间就展开了一次工人阶级主人翁思想的大辩论。
    第二车间灯罩班工人讨论浪费工时现象的时候，有的工人提出：“我们提前下班是因为定额低，任务完成了。论责任是领导的。”当时，许多工人反驳这个说法。他们说：定额低，没有及时修改，领导有责任，可是工人阶级是工厂的主人，定额低了，为什么不提意见修改？领导有缺点，领导检查；我们自己有缺点，也应该检查。第二车间第四班工人讨论产品质量不高造成浪费的原因时，青年工人胡文华说：“工厂质量提不高，是因为没有质量奖。”许多工人立即同他辩论。有的说，同样没有质量奖，第一班、第十一班的工人改进操作技术，密切配合，结果使甲、乙级品都达到80％以上。有的工人问胡文华：过去厂里也有质量奖，但是质量并没有提高；现在没有质量奖，质量反倒提高了，为什么？还有些工人揭发了胡文华以及他们自己不注意操作、赶产量所造成的质量低劣的事实，树立了正确的认识。经过反复辩论，大家认清了个人利益和国家利益的关系。比先进，比贡献，克服浪费的竞赛在工人中广泛开展起来。第二车间的工人还订了遵守劳动纪律的公约，同时对车间领导和科室干部提出了要求。技术人员也积极行动起来，和工人一起试制成功了二十多种新产品。
      干部深入群众
        和工人同呼吸
    从这次反浪费、反保守运动开始，工厂的党、政、工、团领导干部就分别深入小组，和工人一起鸣放。当浪费大量揭发出来以后，领导干部又归纳出十九个关键问题，组织有关工种的工人分成二十一个专业小组，由领导干部分头参加，一起整改。行政领导干部深入下层和工人一起制订出限额领料和责任制度，以及各工种的工艺操作规程等规章制度。
    领导干部深入生产，及时解决了许多关键问题。例如，美术喷花组的工人，提出要把过去小流水的喷花方法改为单人操作，使每班由以往只能出四个花样增加到二十八个。这样，每人需要用的喷枪就要增加很多，但是作业面积不够。参加美术组工作的中共总支书记张健就和工人一起，研究出把单层喷枪架改为双层的措施。工人不会做，他就找木工老师傅一起商量，当天下午做出了样子，试用成功以后，就立即推广。第二车间分支书记吴广这次改变了很少联系工人的作风，和工人一起用氧化钛代替氧化锑来搪烧脸盆，以提高质量。这是一种国内很少生产的高级瓷釉，要求十分严格，操作非常复杂，以前工人几次试验，都失败了。工人看到他亲自动手试验，就说：“吴广都出马了，咱们还能不赶上。”很多工人都要求参加试验，吴广从中挑选了七位老师傅，连战四天四夜，杀过七重难关，终于试制成功，使这批新产品的质量达到了国际水平。
    领导干部改进领导作风以后，更加鼓舞了工人们的革命干劲。不到半个月的时间。他们就使全厂四十八项节约措施实现了二十八项。初步计算，可以节约九万多元。
