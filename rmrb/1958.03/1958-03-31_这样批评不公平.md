    Such Criticism Is Unfair
    After our newspaper published Zhou Zongming's letter on March 3 criticizing the business style of the Shanghai State-Owned Children's Store, we received letters from eighteen readers, including Chen Xinxiang, who unanimously felt that Zhou Zongming's criticism was inappropriate. The letters stated: It is not impossible for a customer to request an exchange if they feel the purchased item is unsuitable, but there is no reason to insist on an exchange. Because the children's hat Zhou Zongming originally bought was not of substandard quality or the wrong size, it could still be worn even if it wasn't exchanged. To avoid damage to general consumer goods from being repeatedly exchanged, making them difficult to sell, the children's store insists on a "no exchange after leaving the store" policy. This is to protect the interests of the state and should not be criticized. Zhou Zongming's behavior of repeatedly requesting an exchange, disrespecting the state-owned store's policy, and only seeking to satisfy personal desires should not be sympathized with.
    We hope that state-owned stores will break free from rigid rules and regulations and try their best to satisfy customers, but we also oppose business practices that disregard national losses and unconditionally cater to customers. Zhou Zongming's criticism of the Shanghai Children's Store's business style is not correct, and it is unfair for the People's Daily editors to support his criticism.

    这样批评不公平
    3月3日本报刊登了周宗明批评上海市国营儿童商店经营作风的来信以后，我们先后收到陈新翔等十八位读者来信，一致认为周宗明的批评不妥当。来信中说：一个顾客对买回去的东西感到不合适要求调换也未尝不可，但也没有理由非要换不可。因为周宗明原来买的童帽不是质量不合规格，尺码大小不合适，即使不换也能戴。儿童商店为了避免一般消费品调来换去受损害不好出售，坚持出门不换制度，这是维护国家利益，不应加以批评。对周宗明这种不尊重国营商店制度，只图满足个人欲望三番两次要求换货的行为，不应给以同情。
    我们希望国营商店打破清规戒律，尽量使顾客满意，但也反对那种不顾国家损失无原则迁就顾客的经营作风。周宗明对上海儿童商店经营作风的批评不够正确，人民日报的编者支持他的批评也不公平。
