    Handling Business Relationships with Statesmanlike Demeanor
    Ministry of Coal and Ministry of Railways Mutually Propose Guarantees to Promote Each Other
    (Our dispatch) To accelerate the turnaround of railway cars and shorten the coal transportation mileage, and to enable better cooperation between the two sides, the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Ministry of Railways recently proposed mutual guarantees.
    These guarantees were first proposed by all comrades attending the National Coal Mine Sales Cadre Meeting of the Ministry of Coal Industry, which is currently being held in Beijing. On March 22, they put forward four guarantees to the Ministry of Railways:
    1.  In 1958, the coal loading time of coal mines nationwide will be reduced by an average of 40 minutes based on the actual completion in 1957; 2. In 1958, the nationwide unified allocation of coal transportation mileage will be shortened by 40 kilometers compared with the actual completion in 1957; 3. In 1958, the proportion of direct coal transport trains will increase from the national average of 38.6% in 1957 to 44%; 4. The monthly transportation plan will be guaranteed to be completed 100% within the scope of regional railway administrations, and each mining bureau will guarantee completion of 98% to 105%, and strive to avoid fluctuations.
    The Ministry of Railways expressed great gratitude for the support given by the Ministry of Coal Industry, and also put forward five guarantees to the Ministry of Coal Industry: 1. In order to meet the requirements of the great leap forward in coal production, it is guaranteed to complete 100% of the 1958 coal transportation task, and complete 50% of the annual plan in the first half of the year; 2. The railways will allocate vehicles to the mining areas, guaranteeing 100% fulfillment according to the ten-day plan; 3. Guarantee the accuracy of the handover forecast to reach 100%; 4. Fully implement the cooperation system; 5. Improve work at any time based on criticism from the coal department.
    According to relevant personnel from the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Ministry of Railways, the guarantees proposed by the Ministry of Coal Industry to the Ministry of Railways are an effective measure to accelerate the turnaround of railway cars, reduce unreasonable transportation, and solve the current contradiction of large railway transportation tasks and insufficient vehicles. The guarantees proposed by the Ministry of Railways to the Ministry of Coal Industry will enable the produced coal to be transported out in a timely manner, ensuring uninterrupted coal production, thereby reducing the idleness and waste of mines and the backlog of coal. What is particularly important is that this mutual proposal of guarantees will greatly promote the work of the two departments, and will also play a good role in promoting the overall great leap forward of various departments of the national economy.

    用政治家风度处理业务关系
    煤炭部铁道部互提保证条件互相促进
    本报讯　为了加速铁路车辆的周转和缩短煤炭的运输里程，为了使双方协作得更好，最近煤炭工业部和铁道部互相提出了保证条件。
    这些保证条件，是由现在在北京举行的煤炭工业部全国煤矿销售干部会议的全体同志首先提出的。3月22日，他们向铁道部提出了四项保证条件：
    一、1958年全国煤矿的煤炭装车时间，在1957年实际完成数的基础上，平均缩短四十分钟；二、1958年全国统一分配的煤炭运输里程，较1957年实际完成数缩短四十公里；三、1958年煤炭运输直达列车比重，由1957年全国平均38.6％增加到44％；四、月间运输计划，在地区管理局范围内，保证100％完成，各矿务局保证完成98％到105％，并争取不波动。
    铁道部对煤炭工业部给予的支援非常感谢，同时也向煤炭工业部提出了五项保证条件：一、为了满足煤炭生产大跃进的要求，保证100％的完成1958年煤炭运输任务，上半年完成全年计划的50％；二、铁路向矿区配车，保证按旬计划100％兑现；三、保证交接车预报的准确性达到100％；四、全部执行协作制度；五、随时根据煤炭部门的批评改进工作。
    据煤炭工业部和铁道部有关人员谈，煤炭工业部向铁道部提出的保证条件，是加速铁路车辆周转，减少不合理运输，解决目前铁路运输任务大、车辆不足的矛盾的一项有效措施。铁道部向煤炭工业部提出的保证条件，将使生产出来的煤炭能及时运出去，保证煤炭生产不间断，从而减少矿山的窝工浪费和产煤积压。尤其重要的是，这种互提保证条件，对两个部门的工作将起极大的促进作用，对促进国民经济各个部门的全面大跃进也将起良好的作用。
