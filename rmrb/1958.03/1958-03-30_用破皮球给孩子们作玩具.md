Making Toys for Children with Broken Balls

It's a pity to throw away broken balls that children have played with. Reusing them to make various toys is easy, economical, and the children will surely love it.

1.  Making Flower Baskets:

    Cut the ball open, removing the broken parts, and you can cut it into a basket with a handle. Various floral patterns can be cut on the edge of the basket and the handle. The outside of the basket can also be painted with various flowers.

2.  Making Small Boats:

    Cut the better part of the broken ball to make the hull, then cut out two pieces of board and a narrow strip and sew them onto the hull to make a rubber boat. It can float in water.

3.  Making Dolls:

    Open a small round hole at the top of the old ball. Then use cloth to wrap some cotton to make the doll's head, and sew the bottom of the head to the top of the ball with thread. Sew a headscarf on the head, and then gather a piece of floral cloth into many small pleats and wrap it around the doll's body as a skirt. Then draw the doll's face. This makes a cute doll.

    You can also tie a bow on the child's head and neck to enhance its beauty.

    用破皮球给孩子们作玩具
    孩子们玩坏了的破皮球，扔了很可惜，利用它再作成各种玩具，又简便，又节约，孩子们一定喜欢。
    1、作花篮：
    把皮球剪开，去掉破的地方，就能剪成带提手的篮子。篮子边上，提手边上都可剪成各种花边。篮子外面也可用漆画上各种花。
    2、作小船：
    将破皮球较好的部分剪做船身，然后再剪下两块船板和一窄条缝在船身上就成了一只橡皮小船。可以在水里飘。
    3、作娃娃：
    在旧皮球上端开一个小圆口。再用布包一些棉花做娃娃的头，头下端与皮球上端用线缝起来。头上缝一块包头巾，再把一块花布用线收成许多小折，围在娃娃身上当裙子。然后画上娃娃的脸。就成了一个可爱的小娃娃。
    还可以在孩子的头上、脖子里打上一个蝴蝶结，增加美观。
