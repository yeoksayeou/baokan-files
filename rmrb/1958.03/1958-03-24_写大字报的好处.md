The benefits of writing big-character posters are immense; their uses are truly boundless.

It is said that in Shanghai, big-character posters are particularly numerous. In the publishing industry alone, with over three thousand people, sixty-five thousand big-character posters have been put up. In various government agencies and units, most people have written a lot, say fifty, one hundred, two hundred, or three hundred. The process of writing big-character posters roughly goes through three stages. Initially, some general opinions are put forward. After writing about fifteen or sixteen, one runs out of things to say. Assuming the quantitative target is fifty, then one is far from reaching it. So, one looks around, reflects on the past, gathers information from all sides, and writes another eighteen or nineteen. This time, the quality is higher, different from before. One is already able to offer sharp criticisms from all directions. But after writing, one runs out of things to say again. Yet, one still has to write. This requires deep thought, engaging the mind, internal reflection and external observation, extending from others to oneself. Not only criticizing from the sidelines, but also feeling responsible oneself. So, one writes another ten or twenty. The quality is even higher. It is said that this is the origin of the proposal made by various circles in Shanghai.

This situation makes a lot of sense. Writing big-character posters first requires facing reality in order to have something to say, which promotes your concern for the collective. Moreover, writing big-character posters takes place during the time of the Socialist Great Leap Forward, which forces you to observe in all directions and listen on all sides. Seeing the current reality with the eyes of all directions, and talking about personal matters with the voices of all sides; this makes one feel intimately connected, sharing weal and woe. Thus, the collective is for me, and I am for the collective, achieving the unity of the individual and the collective. The greater the expectation for collective innovation, the deeper one feels the need for self-transformation. The Shanghai intellectual community's proposal to achieve expertise and redness, becoming redder and more expert, within a few years is precisely the continuation of the spirit of writing big-character posters.

Moreover, when you write big-character posters, you cannot but use your thinking. Thinking is always based on what you have seen, heard, and done. People like us, although we cannot be considered intellectually lazy, often let what we see and hear pass like fleeting clouds, not necessarily taking it to heart. Our daily actions mostly follow the same old patterns, not necessarily with our own insights. Thus, we are passive, prone to experience, and lack innovation. Only when you use your thinking, forcing you to write something out, can you clearly distinguish right from wrong in what you have seen and heard, and good from bad in what you have done, suddenly waking up. In this way, you turn from passive to active, transforming experience into wisdom, and you yourself are also improved and transformed.

Thus, writing big-character posters can not only improve work, innovate the collective, and transform the leadership, but also transform oneself. Moreover, after work, everyone writes, everyone thinks; morale is high, and one feels refreshed. From this, it is clear that the role of writing big-character posters is indeed very great.

    写大字报的好处
    马前卒
    写大字报大有好处，说来可真是妙用无穷。
    据说，在上海，大字报特别多。出版界三千多人，已贴出六十五万张大字报。各个机关单位，大部分人都写了很多，比如说，五十、一百、二百或三百。写大字报的经过，大致有这么三个阶段。开始写，提出一些一般性意见。写呀写的，写上十五、六张，也就写完了。假定数量指标是五十张，那就大差其远。于是东西观看，前后回想，各方搜罗，又写上十八、九张。这一来质量就高，不同于前。已经能够上下左右，四方八面，提出尖锐批评。但写呀写的，又写完了。可是还是要写。这就得左思右想，开动脑筋，内观外察，由人及己。不仅从旁批评，还感到自己也有责任。于是又写上十几二十张。质量也就更高了。据说这就是上海各界倡议书的由来。
    这情况，说来确有道理。写大字报，首先要面对现实，才能有所欲言，这就促进你关心集体。而写大字报又在社会主义大跃进之际，这就逼着你不能不眼观四方，耳听八面。以四方之眼，看当前现实，以八面之风，谈切身之事；这就会感到休戚相关，痛痒与俱。于是乎，集体为我，我为集体，而达到个人与集体的一致了。惟其期望于集体革新者切，也就痛感到自己须改造者深。上海知识界保证，几年内做到红透专深、更红更专的倡议书，正是写大字报精神的继续。
    何况当你写大字报时，不能不运用思考。思考总是以自己所见所闻、所作所为为依据。像我们这样的人，虽然不能算是思想上的懒汉，然而平日所见所闻，易成过眼烟云，未必放在心里。平日所作所为，大都依样葫芦，未必自有所见。于是处于被动，流于经验，而很少创举。只有当你运用思考，逼着你非写点出来不可的时候，那你才能明辨所见所闻中的是非，所作所为中的好坏，忽然清醒过来。这样，你就从被动转为主动，化经验为智慧，而自己也有所提高，有所改造了。
    这样看来，写大字报不仅可以改进工作，革新集体，改造领导，还可以改造自己。而且工作之余，人人动笔，个个运思；群情焕发，胸襟舒畅。由此看来，写大字报的作用确实大得很。
