    "53" Factory Union Advocates Competition
    Strive for Overall Leap Forward in Union Work
    This newspaper's special Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The trade union committee of the nationally famous "53" factory recently proposed to trade union organizations of industrial and mining enterprises across the country to launch a competition for an overall leap forward in trade union work.
    The proposal suggests that they will comprehensively utilize the role of trade union organizations and the role of activists, and gradually reduce the number of full-time trade union cadres. Among all trade union cadres, a widespread competition should be launched to compare ideology, drive, learning from advanced experiences, catching up with advanced experiences, hard work, thoroughness, linking with reality, linking with the masses, working methods, and work efficiency. Trade union cadres should fully promote democracy, personally consult with the masses on matters, and promptly handle and receive letters, visits, applications, and inquiries from the masses, so as to satisfy the masses. Adhere to the system of regularly convening employee representative conferences and small group democratic life meetings to truly place all trade union work under the supervision of the masses. Trade union cadres should implement a system of spending half a day in workshops and work sections, using the method of running experimental plots, specifically dividing labor to help a unit or a department summarize experiences. Trade union cadres at all levels should work hard for a year to become proficient in their own industry's business, learn another trade union business, and understand production management knowledge.
