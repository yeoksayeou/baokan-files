Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 14th: An Indonesian Army spokesperson confirmed on March 14th that government troops occupied Dumai, an important location on the east coast of Central Sumatra, opposite Rupat Island, on the evening of March 12th.

	Spokesperson Piangadi said that Dumai has direct transportation links to the oil-producing areas of Duri and Minas, making it a location of significant value. The liberation of Dumai indicates that the entire oil field region of American Texaco in Central Sumatra is now under the control of government forces, and also demonstrates that the government will be able to more closely monitor smuggling.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 15th: The Indonesian Cabinet, at a meeting held on the evening of March 14th, listened to Prime Minister and Defense Minister Juanda's report on the current political situation in Indonesia, particularly the recent situation in Central Sumatra. The government expressed its gratitude to the Indonesian government forces for successfully completing the tasks entrusted to them in Central Sumatra.

	The "Indonesia Torch Daily" stated that the rebels on the east coast of Central Sumatra have been completely eliminated. This region is rich in oil, and there are also many rubber plantations. Ninety percent of the goods used by the rebels in unauthorized barter trade with foreign countries came from this region.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 14th: News from newspapers in Central Sumatra says that the local people's struggle against the Hussein group is intensifying.

	According to reports, the people of Sungai Sariak in Central Sumatra held a demonstration on March 5th, with 20,000 people participating. The demonstrators held banners reading "Smash the 'Revolutionary' Government, Arrest Hussein-Syafruddin-Djambek."

	Demonstrations were also held in Talawi, Siteinjau Laut and two other places in Central Sumatra. Although the rebels dispersed the demonstrators and the demonstration leaders were arrested, the people's struggle against the Hussein group continues.

	At the same time, there are indications that the Hussein group's army is unstable.

	The Army Intelligence Department said on March 14th that Hussein and other rebels are constantly mobilizing their troops, confiscating weapons, and arresting some soldiers because the soldiers refuse to obey Hussein's orders. Hussein is now hurriedly arming students in Central Sumatra, trying to use students to replace "unreliable" soldiers. The Army authorities said that the people of Central Sumatra and the rebel soldiers have long been looking forward to the landing of government troops, so they gave the government troops a warm welcome.

	Twenty-three politicians in the hinterland of the Riau Islands in eastern Central Sumatra jointly sent a telegram to the central government and army leaders on March 11th, expressing their loyalty to the central government and severing relations with Hussein's "revolutionary government." Among these people are Yunus, the leader of the Masyumi Party in the Riau Islands region, Yusuf of the Socialist Party, and Huhama of the Nationalist Party. It is reported that the Riau Islands were originally within the control of the Hussein group.

    印度尼西亚政府军占领杜迈
    控制德士古公司在中苏门答腊全部油田地区
    中苏门答腊人民展开反叛乱斗争
    新华社雅加达14日电　印度尼西亚陆军发言人14日证实，政府军队在12日晚上占领了中苏门答腊东海岸的一个重要地方——鲁帕特岛对面的杜迈。
    发言人皮恩加迪说，杜迈同石油产地杜里和米纳斯有直接的交通联系，是一个有重要价值的地方。杜迈的解放表明了美国德士古公司在中苏门答腊的全部油田地区现在已经在政府军队的控制之下，同时还表明，政府将能够更加严密地监督走私。
    新华社雅加达15日电　印度尼西亚内阁在14日晚间举行的会议上听取了总理兼国防部长朱安达关于印度尼西亚目前政局、特别是中苏门答腊最近局势的报告。政府对印度尼西亚政府军表示感谢，因为他们在中苏门答腊成功地完成了委托给他们的任务。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”说，中苏门答腊东海岸的叛乱分子已经全部被肃清。这个地区盛产石油，橡胶种植园也很多，叛乱分子擅自同外国进行的易货贸易的物资有90％来自这个地区。
    新华社雅加达14日电　来自中苏门答腊的报纸消息说，当地人民对于侯赛尼集团的斗争正在日益剧烈。
    据消息说，中苏门答腊的素涯沙里克的人民在3月5日举行了示威游行，参加游行的有两万人。游行人群举着“粉碎‘革命’政府，逮捕侯赛尼—沙弗鲁丁—贾姆贝克”的标语。
    在塔拉威、希特英今和中苏门答腊的另外两个地方也举行了示威游行。虽然叛乱分子驱散了示威人群，示威领袖遭到逮捕，但是人民反对侯赛尼集团的斗争正在继续进行。
    同时，有迹象表明，侯赛尼集团军队内部并不稳定。
    陆军情报处14日说，侯赛尼和其他叛乱分子由于士兵拒绝执行侯赛尼的命令，就不断调动他们的军队，没收武器和逮捕若干士兵。侯赛尼现在正匆匆忙忙地武装中苏门答腊的学生，试图用学生来代替“不可靠的”士兵。陆军当局说，中苏门答腊人民和叛军士兵老早就在盼望政府军队登陆，因此他们给予政府军队热烈的欢迎。
    中苏门答腊东部的廖内群岛内地的政界人士二十三人11日联名致电中央政府和陆军领导人，表示效忠中央政府，并且同侯赛尼的“革命政府”断绝关系。这些人当中有马斯友美党廖内群岛地区领袖朱努斯、社会党的优素福和国民党的胡哈茂等人。据报道，廖内群岛原来是在侯赛尼集团控制范围内的。
