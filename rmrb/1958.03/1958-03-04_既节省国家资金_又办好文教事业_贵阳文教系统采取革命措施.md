Guiyang Dispatch: The cultural, educational, and health system of Guiyang City has taken the lead in the anti-waste movement recently. In a month-long campaign against waste and conservatism, they uncovered a shocking 1.63 million yuan in waste, formulated many conservation measures, and each unit generally developed advanced indicators of "more, faster, better, and more economical." The city's thirteen middle schools can add seventeen classes this year without increasing costs, cultivating an additional 3,500 students for the country; five hospitals can add 150 beds; and five theater troupes can turn over 170,000 yuan to the state.

The thirteen middle schools in Guiyang City, in the anti-waste movement, have more deeply resolved the socialist educational direction of work-study programs and half-work, half-study. Although it is currently the holiday season, some teachers and students have voluntarily given up their holidays to participate in industrial, handicraft, and agricultural labor in order to gain experience for the formal implementation of half-work, half-study next semester. Teachers in six Chinese language groups proposed increasing their workload, each teaching literature classes to three classes and also serving as homeroom teachers. This initiative was echoed by teachers in various schools throughout the city, all of whom increased their teaching hours. Principals, Party branch secretaries, and others who did not previously teach are also preparing to teach classes in the future. Students receiving People's Scholarships proposed using their own labor income to reduce the burden on the state, saving the country hundreds of thousands of yuan. One hundred and eighty students receiving People's Scholarships from the Sixth Middle School all participated in earthwork, sand sifting, and other labor in urban construction work during the holiday. It is estimated that this will solve 50% of all People's Scholarships for the next semester. The school also organized woodworking, metalworking, electrical, handicraft, and animal husbandry groups on campus, striving to be self-sufficient in chalk and ink within the year, and to solve simple woodwork, labor tools, and electrical repairs on their own.

The five hospitals under the jurisdiction of Guiyang City used to require large subsidies from the state every year. This time, in the anti-waste movement, they tapped potential, carefully calculated accounts, and examined the bourgeois ideas of pursuing scale, showing off formality, and being extravagant in medical management work. They proposed increasing beds and outpatient volume, reducing the ratio of medical staff to beds from 1.3:1 to 1:1, and extending outpatient hours from eight to twelve hours. At the same time, measures were also taken to accelerate drug turnover and use hospital equipment to produce some medicines. In 1958, without adding a single person or a single penny, 150 beds can be added, which is equivalent to a small hospital. The Workers' Hospital estimates that after three years, it will not need a single penny from the state and can double the hospital on the existing basis.

The theatrical circles of Guiyang City have adopted measures to increase the number of performances, streamline administrative management personnel, and reduce administrative expenses and stage scenery, props, costumes, and lighting expenses. In 1958, they will ensure that they can be self-sufficient and strive to turn over 170,000 yuan to the state, and also improve the quality of performances. The Guiyang Sichuan Opera Troupe divided the entire troupe into two teams, one team performing in Guiyang City and the other touring the countryside and mountains. Comrades in the entire troupe believe that doing so has four major advantages: 1. It can better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers; 2. It can cultivate young actors more quickly, so that each actor can have more stage practice; 3. It strengthens the ideological transformation of actors; 4. It increases the troupe's income.

The cultural, educational, and health system of Guiyang City, in the rectification movement, after this stage of anti-waste, is more confident that as long as the masses are fully mobilized, potential is tapped, revolutionary vigor is roused, and revolutionary methods are adopted, it will be possible to do the work of three yuan with two yuan, to develop undertakings and save costs, and to quickly transform Guiyang City into a cultured, clean, four-free, and beautiful city.

    既节省国家资金　又办好文教事业
    贵阳文教系统采取革命措施
    本报贵阳讯　贵阳市文教卫生系统，最近在反浪费运动中，一马当先，打了头阵。在一个月的反浪费、反保守运动中，揭发了一百六十三万元的惊人浪费，制订了许多节约措施，各单位普遍制订了多、快、好、省的先进指标。全市十三个中学在不增加费用的条件下，今年可增设十七个班，为国家多培养三千五百个学生；五个医院可增设一百五十张病床；五个剧团能上交给国家十七万元。
    贵阳市的十三个中学，在反浪费运动中，更加深入的解决了勤工俭学、半工半读的社会主义教育方向问题。目前虽正值假期，部分师生为给下学期正式实行半工半读取得经验，自动放弃假期分头参加了工业、手工业、农业劳动。六个语文组教师们提出增加工作量，每人教三个班的文学课，还兼班主任。这个倡议得到全市各校教师的响应，都提高了任课时数，原来不兼课的校长、党支部书记等人，也都准备以后兼课。享受人民助学金的学生们，提出要用自己劳动所得减轻国家负担，为国家节省了数十万元的资金。六中一百八十名享受人民助学金的学生，假期开始，全部参加了城市建设工作中的土方、淘沙等劳动。预计可解决下学期全部人民助学金的50％。该校还在校内组织了木工、金工、电工、工艺、饲养等小组，争取年内粉笔墨水自给，简单木器，劳动工具，电气修配自行解决。
    贵阳市属五个医院，过去每年都需要国家给大量补贴，这次在反浪费运动中，挖潜力算细账，检查了医疗管理工作的许多资产阶级的求规模、摆形式、讲阔气等思想，提出增加病床和门诊量，医务人员与病床的比例从一点三比一降至一比一，门诊从八小时延长到十二小时；同时还采取加速药品周转，利用医院设备生产部分医药。1958年不增一个人一文钱，可增设一百五十张病床，等于一个小型医院。工人医院预计经过三年以后，不要国家一个钱，可将医院在现有基础上扩大一倍。
    贵阳市属戏剧界，采取增加演出次数，精简行政管理人员，缩减行政经费与舞台布景、道具、服装、灯光等费用的措施，1958年保证能作到自给自足，而且要争取上缴国家十七万元，还要提高演出质量。贵阳市川剧团把全团分为两队，一队在贵阳市演出、一队下乡上山巡回演出。全团同志认为这样做有四大好处：1，能更好的为工农兵服务；2，能更快的培养青年演员，使每个演员都能有更多的舞台实践；3，加强了演员的思想改造；4，增加了剧团收入。
    贵阳市文教卫生系统，在整风运动中，经过这一阶段的反浪费，更加相信只要充分发动群众，挖掘潜力，鼓起革命干劲，采用革命办法，就能够作到用两个钱办三个钱的事，就能够作到既发展事业，又节省费用，就能够迅速的将贵阳市变成为一个有文化的、整洁的、四无的、环境优美的城市。
