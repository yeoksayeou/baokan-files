    What is "three-tap steelmaking"? You can see it clearly in the photo below: it means having three spouts connected to the tapping hole, simultaneously pouring molten steel into three steel ladles.

    Why can "three-tap steelmaking" increase production? There's only so much molten steel in the furnace. Isn't filling one ladle and then another the same thing?

    Not at all. Originally, ordinary open-hearth furnaces, although designed with the same capacity as the steel ladles, can actually be loaded with more raw materials. Some can be loaded with two furnace charges. By thinking of some methods and making some modifications, some can even be loaded with three furnace charges. This way, the furnace can produce more molten steel. However, the steel ladles are limited by the crane's capacity (and the crane's capacity is limited by the load-bearing capacity of the building's frame), so they cannot be made larger. Moreover, except for Anshan Iron and Steel, other factories in our country have "fixed" open-hearth furnaces. Once the "plug" of the tapping hole is pulled, the molten steel will pour out, unable to be temporarily stopped after filling one ladle to continue filling the next. However, "double-tap" or "three-tap" steelmaking can compensate for this shortcoming, allowing the furnace to load as much raw material as possible and produce as much molten steel as possible. If the crane capacity is insufficient, it can be appropriately increased.

    Currently, many open-hearth furnaces in our country have not even implemented "double-tap steelmaking." If they quickly learn from the experience of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, the national steel production can definitely be increased significantly. As for the open-hearth furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel, they are of the "tilting" type, which, to use an analogy, is like a teapot, which can pour a full cup of tea, then be leveled to pour another cup. Therefore, according to metallurgical experts, Anshan Iron and Steel does not need to promote this method. "Tilting" open-hearth furnace equipment is more expensive than "fixed" ones. To save investment, ordinary steel plants do not use "tilting" open-hearth furnaces.

    The successful trial of the "three-tap steelmaking method" by Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant also has another significance: when building new steel plants with the same output in the future, investment can be saved considerably. Because at that time, the furnaces can be built larger, and smaller cranes can be used, thereby greatly reducing the structural requirements of the building frame.

### 什么是“三槽出钢”？

    什么是“三槽出钢”？
    什么是“三槽出钢”呢？大家从下面这张照片可以看得很清楚：就是有三个槽接连着出钢口，把钢水同时注入三个盛钢桶。
    为什么“三槽出钢”能够增产呢？炉子里只有那么多钢水，盛满一桶再盛一桶，不是一样吗？
    并不一样。原来，一般的平炉，虽然设计的容量同盛钢桶的容量是一样的，但是，其实可以多装原料。有的可以装两炉料。想些办法，改装一下，有的还可以装三炉料。这样，炉子就可以多出钢水。但是，盛钢桶却受着吊车能力的限制，（吊车的能力又受着房架的负荷能力的限制）不能加大。而我国除鞍钢以外，其他厂的平炉都是“固定式”的，把出钢口的“塞子”一拔，钢水就要倾炉而出，不能盛满了一桶，暂时塞住，接着再盛。而“双槽”出钢或“三槽”出钢，就可以弥补这个缺点，让炉子尽量多装原料，尽量多出钢。吊车如果不够，还可以酌量增加。
    现在我国有不少平炉，连“双槽出钢”还没有实行。如果他们赶快学习太原钢铁厂的经验，全国合计起来，钢产量一定可以增加很多。至于鞍钢的平炉，是“倾动式”的，打个比喻，就好像茶壶一样，可以斟满了一杯茶，放平了，再斟一杯。所以据冶金方面的专家说，鞍钢可以不推行这种方法。“倾动式”平炉设备比“固定式”贵，为了节省投资，一般的钢铁厂都不采用“倾动式”平炉。
    太原钢铁厂试验“三槽出钢法”成功，还有一个意义，就是以后建设同等产量的新炼钢厂时，投资可以节省不少。因为那时可以把炉子建得大些，吊车则可以用小型的，从而房架结构就可以大大减轻。
