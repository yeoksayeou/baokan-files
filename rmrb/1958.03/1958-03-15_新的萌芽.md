    New Sprouts

    Good news comes from the steel front: The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has created the three-tap steelmaking method, increasing steel output by 42%, foreshadowing a new leap forward in the steel industry.

    Our people are responding to the call of the Party Central Committee with practical actions, striving to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products in about fifteen years. To achieve this goal, in addition to everyone having high revolutionary enthusiasm, we must also continuously transform our backward production tools into advanced production tools, and gradually transform backward industries into industries with modern technological equipment. That is to say, in addition to continuing the political and ideological socialist revolution, we must also carry out a technical revolution. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's change from two-tap to three-tap steelmaking, the technical improvements in other factories and mines, as well as the reform of agricultural tools and transportation tools, etc., are all sprouts of the technical revolution. We must cherish these sprouts and do everything possible to support them.

    新的萌芽
    钢铁战线传来捷报：太原钢铁厂创造了三槽出钢法，把出钢量提高了42％，预示钢铁工业将有一个新的跃进。
    我国人民正以实际行动响应党中央的号召，要在十五年左右把我国的钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量赶上或者超过英国。实现这个目标，除了每个人要有高涨的革命干劲以外，还必须不断地把我们落后的生产工具改变为先进的生产工具，把落后的工业逐渐变为具有现代技术装备的工业。也就是说，除了继续进行政治上、思想上的社会主义革命而外，还要进行一次技术革命。太原钢铁厂改二槽出钢为三槽出钢，其它工厂矿山的技术改进，以及改革农具，改革交通运输工具等等，都是技术革命的萌芽。我们要爱护这些萌芽，千方百计地扶植它们。
