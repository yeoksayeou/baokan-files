Comrades at the Institute of Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, have offered many opinions on my political inclinations and ideological style in big-character posters. At first, I didn't pay much attention. Moreover, some of the opinions were not entirely consistent with the facts, which made me feel somewhat wronged. However, passing by the big-character posters every day on my way to and from work, I couldn't help but take a look. Over time, I began to doubt myself. Because I thought that the common views of the masses could not be groundless. Especially considering that a truly leftist person, even if they make mistakes, should not give the masses a rightist impression. This forced me to start facing myself squarely. Immediately afterwards, under the leadership of the Party organization at the institute, all senior research staff held a month-long ideological meeting and discussion. Through mutual assistance from comrades, my thinking underwent significant changes.

Recalling the early days of Liberation, I was skeptical of the Party. But after the inflation left by the reactionary government was quickly brought under control, I began to develop faith in the Communist Party. After the Korean War and the "Three-Anti and Five-Anti" campaigns, I both respected and feared the Party. I remained in this stage for a long time. However, the improvement of people's lives, the development of construction, and the rise of international status could not leave me indifferent. But I progressed very slowly. This was clearly the influence of bourgeois education. Because I could only view the Party from the perspective of personal interests, I lost my way in matters of right and wrong. For example, in the early stages of the anti-Rightist struggle, I did not quite agree with the approach of the People's Daily, and I even resonated with some of the Rightists' remarks. Although I did not fall into the Rightist mire, I was approaching a dangerous direction. Through this movement, I received a great education. Many examples made me feel the Party's warmth. My brother, Professor Fu Ying, had made some remarks that, although not malicious, were very wrong, and many people and I were worried about him. But the Party was realistic. The Party gave him a lot of help, which not only educated him but also educated others. Who says the Party doesn't protect scientists?! Reflecting on my own ideological situation, I cannot but thank the Party for saving me. In this movement and the recent discussion, the Party's help was very timely, and it adopted different methods such as enlightenment and encouragement. All this painstaking effort was nothing more than hoping that I would transform myself better and serve the people better. The above is just an example to illustrate how my feelings towards the Party gradually changed from awe to warmth. There are many other examples, but the rule is only one: with a common ideological foundation, warm feelings arise everywhere; otherwise, even if the Party is very concerned, it may be overlooked. Since this review, I feel closer to the organization. Chairman Mao once said: "Politics is the commander." The understanding of this commander is concentratedly manifested in the understanding of the Party. From my own experience, this sentence has a very profound meaning for me.

Intellectuals who came from the old society are mostly infected with varying degrees of bourgeois consciousness. This consciousness conflicts with the socialist system. In the early days of Liberation, this contradiction was not very obvious; but today, when the system of ownership has been changed, this contradiction has reached a critical point. For example, no one has said that I lack enthusiasm for geophysical science. But deep down, it does not originate from improving society, but from the desire for personal fame and gain, because I am always thinking that if someone writes a history of Chinese geophysical science in the future, my name must occupy a place. This kind of thinking is enough to illustrate the problem. Sometimes I have also used sayings such as "science for science's sake" to cover myself up, but in fact, this kind of saying is untenable. In the old society, I was once discriminated against, so I worked hard to improve my treatment through scientific research. Although I was dissatisfied with the old society, I never thought of reforming that system. The socialist road did not exist for me, I was taking the bourgeois road. The guiding ideology was the individualism of private knowledge, so I was bound to be keen on the pursuit of fame and gain. At that time, almost everyone had this kind of thinking, but everyone tacitly agreed, so I didn't think it was wrong. In the new society, this kind of thinking basically conflicts with collective interests, so it is bound to run into walls everywhere, and it will run into more and more. Take training cadres as an example, the mentor's thinking cannot but affect young people! When guiding young people, I always emphasize individual effort, and never mention the collective. This invisibly encourages their thinking of climbing up. Someone on the big-character poster once said that a young person learned my dark side, and I couldn't accept it at first, because I thought I had never consciously directed young people towards the dark direction. If he is not good, what does it have to do with me? But on closer thought, the connection between older scientists and young people is generally more frequent. The bourgeois ideology of older scientists, if it does not have a bad influence on young people, is impossible.

An important derivative of bourgeois individualism in terms of work style is arrogance and conceit. This is particularly evident in my criticism of people, rude attitude, and seeking personal prominence. Wherever I go to work, I leave this impression on people to varying degrees. In the past, I myself felt it, and I wanted to correct it; but I thought that my evaluation of things had some factual basis, and arrogance and conceit were just a bad attitude. This of course cannot solve the problem. After this movement, I deeply realized that arrogance and conceit is also a matter of two roads, that is, the arrangement of individuals and collectives. The achievements of the motherland today are mainly due to the people, but what have I done for society? Thinking of this, I am at a loss, and I can't hold my head up high.

The discussion also exposed and criticized many other ugly problems existing in the thinking of senior intellectuals in our institute. These problems have affected the unity of our institute, delayed the progress of geophysical science, and hindered the road of being both red and expert. Today, everyone is bringing these problems to light in order to express their determination to burn their mistakes under the supervision of the masses. However, ideological transformation is not something that can be obtained easily. Encouraged by the Party's education and the construction of the motherland in recent years, intellectuals have the conditions for transformation; however, the specific process is still not very simple. Recalling my initial review, I felt that I had a good idea in my heart and would not make any unexpected mistakes. It was not until the comrades frankly raised the opinions that they usually did not say that I was shocked and truly felt the difficulty of self-knowledge. At this time, I was both ashamed and angry. The "bottom" that I had imagined had sunk somewhere. At one time, I almost completely lost my confidence. Of course, opinions are inevitably not completely correct. For opinions that are obviously correct, it is easier to accept, and once recognized, there is a feeling of wishing to correct them as soon as possible. However, for opinions that are not completely correct, there is bound to be a resistant mood, and even the correct parts are unwilling to accept. At this time, the help of the Party and comrades is very important. I realized that how to treat criticism is a serious test for me. After several calm considerations, I was finally able to jump out of the circle of "subjective wishes" and "objective effects," and look for the essence of the mistake and the root of the thought from the general trend of criticism. In this way, I also spent several sleepless nights. However, after I figured it out, I felt relieved. This process is probably similar for other comrades, because now the comrades who have made sharp opinions to each other are unusually cordial and relaxed when they meet.

It has been twenty-five years since I graduated from university. After this cleaning, I realized that in these twenty-five years, my understanding of politics, career, and individuals, that is, the placement of individuals and collectives, was simply a mess. Now, I am somewhat like awakening from a spring dream. However, whether I wake up very clearly, and whether I will re-enter the dream, remains to be seen in future efforts. At this moment, it is difficult to describe my mood. I seem to be slowly turning over a page in the history of my life. Ahead is the vast land of the motherland; looking back at the smoke and clouds, it is like another world.

    春梦乍醒
    中国科学院地球物理研究所研究员  傅承义
    中国科学院地球物理研究所许多同志在大字报上对于我的政治倾向和思想作风提了不少的意见。起初，我并未十分重视。并且，其中有些意见与事实不无出入，反而使我觉得自己有些委屈。可是，每日上下班必在大字报前面经过，不可避免地每天要看上几眼。久而久之，我对自己就发生了怀疑。因为我想，群众共同的见解不能说持之无故。特别是想到，一个政治真是左倾的人，即使犯有错误，也是不可能给群众一个右倾的印象的。这就迫使我开始正视自己。紧接着，在所里党组织的领导下，全所高级研究人员进行了为时一月多的思想见面座谈会。通过同志们的互相帮助，我的思想有了很大的变化。
    回忆解放初期，我对党是怀疑的。及至反动政府留下来的通货膨胀很快地被制止之后，我才开始对共产党发生信仰。抗美援朝、“三反五反”之后，我对党是又敬又畏。我在这个阶段上停留了很长时间。然而，人民生活的改善，建设事业的发展，国际地位的提高，都不能使我无动于衷。但是，我前进得很慢。这显然是资产阶级教育的影响。因为我只能从个人利害的角度来看党，所以我就在大是大非中迷失了方向。例如，在反右派斗争的初期，我对人民日报的作法颇不以为然，对某些右派言论也起过共鸣，虽然没有堕入右派泥坑，但是已向危险方向逼近。经过这次运动，我受到了很大的教育。许多事例，使我感到了党的亲切。我的哥哥傅鹰教授曾有过一些虽无恶意但很错误的言论，我和不少人都替他?一把汗。但是，党是实事求是的。党给了他很多的帮助，不但教育了他，而且也教育了别人。谁说党不保护科学家呢！？我反省自己的思想情况，也不能不感谢党对我的挽救。在这次运动和最近的座谈会中，党对于我的帮助很及时，而且采取了开导、鼓励等不同的方式。这样煞费苦心，无非是希望我改造得好一些，更好地为人民服务。以上只举个例子来说明我对党的感觉怎样从敬畏渐渐转为亲切。例子还有很多，不过规律只有一条：有了共同的思想基础，亲切的感觉就处处发生；否则，党虽十二分关怀，也可能是熟视无睹的。自从这次检查之后，我同组织之间自觉更亲近一步。毛主席曾讲过：“政治是统帅”。对于这个统帅的认识，集中地表现在对于党的认识上。由我自身的经验来说，这句话对我有极深刻的意义。
    由旧社会过来的知识分子，绝大多数沾染着不同程度的资产阶级意识。这种意识与社会主义制度有矛盾。在解放初期，这种矛盾还不大明显；但是在所有制已经改变的今天，这种矛盾便到了图穷匕首见的程度。比如，我对于地球物理科学，现在还没有人说我缺乏热情。但思想深处并非从改进社会出发，而是发源于个人名利的愿望，因为我时刻在想着将来若有人写中国地球物理科学史的时候，我的名字必须占一个地位。这种思想已足以说明问题。有时我也曾用“为科学而科学”这类的说法来掩饰自己，其实这种说法是不堪一击的。在旧社会，我有一个时期曾受过歧视，因而发愤用功，想从科学研究的途径来改善自己的待遇。我虽然对旧社会不满，但是从未想去改革那个制度。社会主义道路对我是不存在的，我走的是资产阶级的道路。主导思想是知识私有的个人主义，因此我就必然热衷于名利的追求。当时，这种思想几乎人人都有，不过大家心照不宣，所以我也不觉其非。在新社会，这种思想和集体利益基本冲突，因之必然要到处碰壁，而且将愈来愈碰得多。就拿培养干部来说，导师的这种思想不能不影响青年！我在指导青年时，总是强调个人努力，而从不涉及集体。这就无形中助长了他们向上爬的思想。大字报上曾有人说，一个青年人学到我阴暗的一面，我起初很不能接受，因为我认为自己从来没有有意识地把青年指向阴暗的方向。他若不好，与我何干。但是仔细想来，年长的科学家和青年的联系，一般是较多的。年长科学家的资产阶级思想意识，要想不对青年发生恶劣的影响，那是不可能的。
    资产阶级个人主义在作风方面一个重要的派生物就是狂妄自大。这在我特别表现在臧否人物、态度粗暴及寻求个人突出等方面。凡是我到什么地方工作，都在不同程度上给人留下这个印象。过去，我自己也感觉到了，也很想加以纠正；不过我却认为自己对事物的评价多少有些事实的根据，狂妄自大只不过是态度不好而已。这当然不能解决问题。经过这次运动，我才深切了解到狂妄自大也是一个两条道路的问题，即个人与集体的安排问题。祖国之有今日，人民群众的功绩是主要的，可是自己对社会曾作了些什么呢？想到这里，惘然若失，我就翘不起什么尾巴来了。
    座谈会中还揭露和批判存在于我所高级知识分子的思想中的其他许多丑恶问题。这些问题曾影响了我所的团结，推迟了地球物理科学事业的进展，阻碍了红而又专的道路。今天大家把这些问题托出来，为的是表示决心，在群众监督之下，把自己的错误烧掉。但是，思想改造并不是唾手可拾的。几年来受到党的教育和祖国建设的鼓舞，知识分子已经具备改造的条件；然而具体的过程仍不是很简单的。回忆我在初检查时，还自觉心中有底，不会犯什么意料之外的错误。及至同志们坦率地将平日不大说的意见提出之后，我才感到震惊，才真地感到自知之难。这时我是既惭愧，又愤怒。自己所幻想的“底”，已不知陷到何处去了。有一个时候，我几乎完全失去了自信。当然，意见总难免有些不完全正确。对于显然正确的意见，接受比较容易，而且既经认识之后，还有改之惟恐不速之感。但是，对于不完全正确的意见，却不免有抗拒的情绪，甚至连它的正确部分也不愿接受。这时，党和同志们的帮助是很重要的。我认识到，如何对待批评，是对我的一个严重考验。经过几番冷静的考虑之后，我终于能够跳出“主观愿望”、“客观效果”之类的圈子，而从批评的总趋势中，去寻找错误本质和思想根源。这样，我也经过了几个不眠之夜。然而我在想通之后，却是如释重负。这种过程，其他同志大概也相似，因为现在彼此提过尖锐意见的同志们在见面时，都是异常亲切而轻松的。
    我从大学毕业已经二十五年。经过这次清理，我才发现在这二十五年期间，我对政治、事业和个人的认识，即是说对个人与集体的摆法，简直是一塌糊涂。现在，我有些像春梦乍醒。但是，醒得是否很清楚，以及是否还会重新入梦，还有待今后的努力。此时心境，很难形容。我仿佛在慢慢翻过生命史的一页。前面是祖国的万里山河；回首烟云，恍如隔世。
