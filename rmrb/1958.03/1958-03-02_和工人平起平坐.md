    On Equal Footing with Workers
    Dividing worker dormitories into cadre dormitories and worker dormitories in employee housing is a manifestation of bureaucracy and fastidiousness.
    The leading cadres of the Fuxin Ping'an Coal Mine moving into worker dormitories, being on equal footing with workers, living and laboring together, and closely relating to the workers, is a good example of resolutely eliminating bureaucracy and fastidiousness.
    In our bright socialist society, enterprise leaders and the worker masses, although with different divisions of labor and different positions, are all members of ordinary laborers of the entire society, and there is no distinction of high or low status. However, some leading personnel are contaminated with the officialdom and delicacy of the ruling class in the old society, regard themselves as special, and are unwilling to integrate with ordinary laborers in life and work, isolating themselves from the masses. This is very harmful to the leaders themselves and to the cause of socialist construction.
    In a socialist society, the relationship between enterprise leaders and workers is a kind of production relationship. Only by doing a good job in this relationship can we continuously promote the development of productive forces. Therefore, how to eliminate bureaucracy and fastidiousness, abandon special thinking, and closely relate to the masses is a major event in changing leadership style and promoting the leap forward in production.
    This initiative of the leading cadres of the Fuxin Ping'an Mine is the budding of a new thing, which is worthy of cherishing and promotion.

    和工人平起平坐
    在职工宿舍中分出干部宿舍和工人宿舍，这就是官气和娇气的一种表现。
    阜新平安煤矿领导干部迁入工人宿舍，和工人平起平坐，同生活，共劳动，密切同工人的关系，是坚决打掉官气娇气的好榜样。
    在我们光明灿烂的社会主义社会中，企业领导者和工人群众，虽然分工不同、职务有别，但都是整个社会普通劳动者的一员，并没有什么高低贵贱之别。可是，某些领导人员沾染了旧社会统治阶级的官风和娇气，自视特殊，在生活上和工作上都不愿意和普通劳动者打成一片，脱离群众，把自己孤立起来。这样，对领导者本身和对社会主义建设事业都十分有害。
    在社会主义社会中，企业领导者和工人的关系，是一种生产关系，只有搞好这种关系，才能不断地促进生产力的发展。因此，如何打掉官气和娇气，放弃特殊思想，密切同群众的关系，是改变领导作风和推动生产跃进的大事。
    阜新平安矿领导干部这个创举，是新事物的萌芽，值得珍视，值得推广。
