Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: Peking University's Party Committee today, at the school-wide "Double-Anti" movement mobilization rally, called on all teachers and students to debate together and rectify together, to exert full effort and leap forward in the direction of being both red and expert. Three hours after the meeting, more than 88,000 big-character posters were put up throughout the school.

The teachers and students of Peking University were full of energy at today's mobilization meeting, with unprecedentedly high morale. Both on and off the stage, they shouted, "Be promoters and strive to be the first in the world!" and "Work hard and go all out, bloom everywhere!" The student representative of the Department of Geology and Geography said on the stage, "We must march forward in high spirits, pass the socialist test, surge forward mightily, cut off the roots of capitalism, thoroughly and completely." Some units that were relatively backward in the past also took the stage to express their desire to turn things around completely in this movement, changing backwardness into "full bloom."

Each unit and each individual, in challenging and responding to challenges, first compared the number of big-character posters and the exposure of problems. Many professors took the stage to express their welcome for everyone's criticism, saying they wanted to be seen on the big-character posters.

Teachers and students also compared ideological transformation and strove to leap forward in the direction of being both red and expert. Cao Jinghua, the director of the Russian Department, used poetry to express his determination and the determination of all the teachers in the Russian Department. He recited at the meeting: "Our hearts are on fire, our hearts are red, red, red, we won't be satisfied until we are red to the core. ... And we must be expert, expert, expert, we must be deeply expert without limit. All of this is for the sake of humanity's tomorrow." The student representative of the Department of Geology and Geography said: "Since we can change the face of nature, we can also change our own ideological face. Since we can find underground resources to serve the motherland, we can also dedicate everything we have to the motherland's socialist cause." Teachers in the Chemistry Department, in their challenge, compared themselves with other departments in the school in terms of the number of people turning left and the speed of progress among old professors. Wei Jiangong, a professor in the Chinese Department, proposed competing with everyone in handing their hearts over to the Party, in exchanging hearts with each other, and in exchanging hearts with students. Zheng Xin, the director of the Philosophy Department, proposed opening a course on Kantian philosophy this semester as his own experimental field for criticizing idealism with Marxist ideological viewpoints. Duan Xuefu, the director of the Mathematics Department, walked to the stage and said: "Being red means handing our hearts over to the people, and being expert means handing our knowledge over to the people. I want to strive to become a Communist Party member who dedicates both heart and knowledge to the people through this movement."

At the beginning of the meeting, Lu Ping, the First Secretary of the Peking University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, gave a mobilization report. In his report, he pointed out that the waste and conservatism existing in Peking University were serious, and that it was full of "five airs," with arrogance and stagnation being particularly strong. He hoped that all teachers and students would use their brains, take action, and consciously carry out the revolution, sweeping away bourgeois products and leaping forward towards being both red and expert.

Before the mobilization meeting, all the teachers and students had made full preparations. Many teachers went out to visit the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site and nearby factories and shops, breathing in the socialist vigor of the great leap forward of workers and peasants. On the 1st, the Peking University Party Committee convened an enlarged cadre meeting attended by the directors of various departments and responsible persons of democratic parties to preliminarily discuss the nature, content, and plan of the "Double-Anti" movement. At the meeting, many cadres and teachers put forward suggestions for sweeping away stagnation, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, and launching a conscious revolutionary movement. From the 5th to the 8th, the school also held a school affairs committee to further discuss the main content of the "Double-Anti" movement. At the meeting, the enthusiasm of many professors was unstoppable. They revealed the main problems of waste in cultivating talent, and at the same time, launched challenges to each other. Some professors said: Reforming our thinking is painful, but just as people can turn ore into steel, they can also temper themselves to become redder. Cao Jinghua, the director of the Russian Department, composed a poem at the meeting to compete with everyone in enthusiasm: "Burn down the mountain of conservatism, strive for redness and expertise, vigorously grasp teaching, and strive to be the first in the world."

    火烧保守山  奔向红又专
    北京大学师生高歌猛进
    本报特约新华社讯　北京大学党委会今天在全校“双反”运动誓师动员大会上，号召全体师生一起来鸣辩，一起来整改，鼓足干劲向又红又专的方向跃进。会后三小时，全校就贴出大字报八万八千多张。
    北京大学的师生们在今天的动员会上，干劲十足，斗志空前昂扬，台上台下纷纷高呼“要做促进派，争为天下先！”“要大干特干，四面开花！”地质地理系的学生代表在台上说：“我们要高歌猛进，过社会主义关，浩浩荡荡，斩资本主义根，彻彻底底。”一些过去在运动中比较落后的单位也上台表示要在这次运动中大翻身，变落后为“满堂红”。
    每个单位每个人在挑战应战中都首先比贴大字报比揭发问题。不少教授上台表示欢迎大家批评，要在大字报上见。
    师生们还比思想改造比向又红又专的方向跃进。俄语系主任曹靖华用诗表达他和俄语系全体教师的决心，他在大会上朗诵：“我们满心起了火，心里一片红，红，红，红不到透顶心不甘。……而且要专，专，专，一定专到深无限。这全是为了整个人类的明天。”地质地理系的学生代表说：“既然大自然的面貌我们都能改变，我们也就能改变自己的思想面貌，既然地下的资源我们能寻找出来为祖国服务，我们也就能把自己的一切献给祖国的社会主义事业。”化学系的教师在挑战中就和全校各系比向左转的人多，比老教授进步快。中文系教授魏建功提出和大家比把心交给党，比互相交心，比和学生交心。哲学系主任郑昕提出在这学期开康德哲学课，作为自己用马克思主义思想观点批判唯心主义的试验田。数学系主任段学复走到台上说：“红就是把心交给人民，专就是把知识交给人民。我要通过这次运动争取成为把心和知识全都献给人民的共产党员。”
    大会开始时，中共北京大学委员会第一书记陆平作了动员报告。他在报告中提出北大所存在的浪费和保守的情况是严重的，而且“五气”俱全，骄气、暮气特别浓。他希望全体师生大家动脑筋，大家动手，大家自觉地来革命，把资产阶级产物横扫清，向又红又专大跃进。
    在动员会前，全校师生已经做了充分的酝酿和准备。许多教师出外参观了十三陵水库工地和附近的工厂、商店，呼吸了工人、农民大跃进的社会主义朝气。1日，北大党委召集了有各系主任、民主党派负责人参加的党的扩大干部会议，初步讨论了“双反”运动的性质、内容和计划。会上就有不少干部和教师提出扫除暮气，兴无灭资，开展自觉革命运动的建议。5日到8日，全校又举行了校务委员会，进一步讨论了“双反”的主要内容。会上许多教授的热情锐不可挡。他们纷纷揭发培养人材上的主要浪费问题，同时相互展开了挑战，有的教授说：整思想是痛苦的，但人能把矿石炼成钢铁，也就能把自己锻炼得更红。俄语系主任曹靖华在会上就作了首诗要和大家比干劲：“火烧保守山，奔向红又专，大力抓教学，争为天下先。”
