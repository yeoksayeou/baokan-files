Xinhua News Agency, 7th - The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held its 94th meeting this afternoon and approved the agreement between the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on navigation by merchant ships on the border, connecting rivers, and lakes.

    This agreement was signed in Moscow on December 21, 1957. There are many Sino-Soviet border rivers and lakes, with a total navigable distance of approximately 5,790 kilometers. Historically, the people of both countries have used these natural shipping conditions for the transportation of goods between the two countries. Since liberation, due to the growing friendly relations between the two countries, the trade of goods between the two countries has also increased. However, due to the lack of a formal navigation agreement, these excellent navigable waterways have not been fully utilized for the exchange of goods between the two countries. This has caused inconvenience to both governments and peoples.

    The agreement stipulates that merchant ships of both parties may freely navigate the Heilongjiang River (including the lower reaches of the Heilongjiang River within Soviet territory to the estuary), the Songhua River, the Ussuri River, the Ergun River, the Kara-Ertysh River, the Ili River, the Songacha River, and Lake Xingkai. In addition to the border rivers and lakes mentioned above, the length of the connecting rivers is 1,691 kilometers within Soviet territory (the navigable length after future channel development will be 1,982 kilometers) and 1,054 kilometers within Chinese territory (the navigable length after future channel development will be 1,474 kilometers).

    The agreement stipulates that when vessels of one party arrive at a port of the other party, preferential treatment will be mutually provided for port loading and unloading, fuel, food supply, and medical assistance to crew members.

    The agreement stipulates that relevant shipping enterprises of China and the Soviet Union may participate in the transportation of Sino-Soviet goods and transit goods. At the same time, the agreement specifically points out that goods will be rationally allocated among the shipping enterprises of both parties to ensure that the shipping enterprises of both China and the Soviet Union can satisfactorily participate in this transportation.

    According to this agreement, in major Sino-Soviet cities such as Harbin and Jiamusi in Northeast China and Khabarovsk and Komsomolsk-on-Amur in the Soviet Far East, as well as trade goods between the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China and the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union, there will be better conditions to use ships of both countries for direct and low-cost transportation. This will play a certain role in promoting the economic development of both countries, especially the border areas, and the unity of the people of both countries, and will also make an important contribution to the development of the shipping industry in both countries.

    After discussion, the meeting approved in principle the "Provisional Regulations on the Handling of Retirement of Workers and Staff" of the State Council. The meeting also approved the list of appointments and removals.

    全国人民代表大会常委会举行会议
    批准中苏国境及其相通河流通航协定
    新华社7日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会今天下午举行第九十四次会议，批准了中华人民共和国政府和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府关于国境及其相通河流和湖泊的商船通航协定。
    这个协定是1957年12月21日在莫斯科签订的。中苏两国国境及其相通的河流、湖泊很多，通航里程长约五千七百九十公里。在历史上，两国人民曾利用过这种天然的航运条件，进行两国间的物资运输。解放以后，由于两国的友好关系日益增长，两国间的贸易物资也日益增加，但是因为没有正式的通航协定，所以这些良好的通航航道，还没有充分地利用来进行两国间的物资交流。对此，两国政府和人民均感到不便。
    协定中规定双方商船可以在黑龙江（包括苏联境内黑龙江下游至出海口）、松花江、乌苏里江、额尔古纳河、喀喇额尔齐斯河、伊犁河、松阿察河和兴凯湖上自由通航。上述河流和湖泊，除国境河流和湖泊外，其相通河流的里程，计在苏联境内为一千六百九十一公里（将来经过航道开发，可以通航的里程将为一千九百八十二公里），在中国境内为一千零五十四公里（将来经过航道开发，可以通航的里程将为一千四百七十四公里）。
    协定中规定一方船舶到对方港口时，有关港口装卸、燃料、食品供应、船员医疗救助等互相提供优惠条件。
    协定中规定，中苏两国有关航运企业都可以参加中苏物资和过境物资的运输，同时，协定中还特别指出，货物将在双方航运企业间合理分配，保证中苏双方航运企业都能满意的参加这种运输。
    根据这个协定，在中苏较大城市如中国东北的哈尔滨、佳木斯和苏联远东的伯力、共青城等城市，以及中国新疆维吾尔自治区和苏联哈萨克加盟共和国之间的贸易物资，将有更好的条件，利用两国船舶进行直接的、廉价的运输。这样对于促进两国尤其是国境地区的经济发展和两国人民的团结，都有一定作用，对于两国航运事业的开展，也有重要贡献。
    会议经过讨论，原则批准了“国务院关于工人、职员退职处理的暂行规定”。会议还通过了任免名单。
