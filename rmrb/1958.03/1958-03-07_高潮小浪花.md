    Small High Tide Wave
    Li Xue'ao
          Peak after peak of achievement, leap forward after leap forward, we again use colorful big-character posters to fly a rainbow on the wall. Rainbow, ah, rainbow, so magnificent, so charming, it is the longest magic whip, driving my factory to gallop day and night!
      Holiday
      During the holidays, no one went to the store, no one went to the park, each person packed a small notebook, like Tang Sanzang going to the Western Heaven to obtain scriptures, doing everything possible to gain experience. Go to factories with thirty or twenty people, go to workshops with eight or nine hundred people, find masters with wrinkled faces, find young people with nimble hands and feet, learn from whoever is advanced, ask whoever is advanced for guidance. … How great, our holiday, no loitering, no spending money, but we have thrown away our burdens and mounted our saddles…

    高潮小浪花
    李学鳌
          虹洪峰接着洪峰，跃进连着跃进，我们又用七彩的大字报啊，在墙壁上飞起一道长虹。长虹啊，长虹，如此壮观，如此迷人，它是一把最长的神鞭，赶着我的工厂在日夜飞奔！
      假　日假日里，谁也没进商店，谁也没进公园，一人装一小本，像唐僧取经到西天，千方百计取经验。到三二十人的工厂，到八九百人的车间，找满脸皱纹的师傅，找手脚轻快的青年，谁先进就向谁学习，谁先进就请谁指点。……多好啊，我们的假日，没有闲逛，也没有花钱，然而却扔掉了包袱，跨上了马鞍……
