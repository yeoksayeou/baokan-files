    PLA Goes to Taihang Mountains to Support Farmers' Great Construction

    (Our reporter Zhan Chao reports) A unit of the People's Liberation Army, braving the cold wind, marched mightily into the Taihang Mountains to help the people of the old revolutionary base areas build the mountainous region.

    This construction army marched along the Handan-Changzhi highway into the mountains on February 23. They will march for five days to reach Tunliu County, on the western slope of the Taihang Mountains, to support the construction project of the Jiang River Reservoir. This reservoir has a storage capacity of more than 60 million cubic meters and is expected to be completed by the end of June. This autumn, it will be able to irrigate more than 200,000 mu of cultivated land in Tunliu and Changzi counties. It is one of the large-scale water conservancy projects currently under construction in Shanxi Province.

    At the same time, another unit arrived in northwestern Shanxi to participate in the agricultural capital construction project in Wuzhai County.

    The People's Liberation Army's support for construction in the mountains has greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the people in the mountainous areas.

    解放军开上太行山支援农民大建设
    本报讯　记者展潮报道：人民解放军某部冒着寒风，浩浩荡荡开上太行山，帮助老区人民建设山区。
    这支建设大军，2月23日沿着邯（郸）长（治）大道上山，他们将行军五天，到达太行山西麓的屯留县，支援绛河水库的建设工程。这个水库容水量六千多万立方公尺，预计6月底竣工，今年秋季即可灌溉屯留、长子两县二十多万亩耕地。是山西省目前动工修建的大型水利工程之一。
    和这同时，另一支部队到达晋西北，参加五寨县的农业基本建设工程。
    人民解放军上山支援建设，大大地鼓舞了山区人民的生产热情。
