    Timely Discovery and Timely Resolution

    Cadres sent to lower levels used to have the habit of reading newspapers while in the offices. After being sent to the countryside, they have fewer learning materials, making their need for newspapers even more urgent. However, due to the limitations of rural conditions, it is difficult to see newspapers in a timely manner, usually taking four or five days. How to resolve this contradiction? As long as we care about the cadres sent to lower levels and frequently understand their needs and difficulties, we can definitely come up with solutions. The method of newspaper distribution in Yuanyang County is proof of this.

    This year during the Spring Festival, the Organization Department of the CPC Xinxiang Prefectural Committee in Henan Province sent people to Yuanyang to visit cadres sent to lower levels. After discovering this problem, they immediately discussed a solution with the Yuanyang County Committee: on the one hand, they adjusted the postal delivery schedule and changed the departure time. The previous situation of the mail arriving in the county on the same day but only being distributed to the various townships the next day was changed so that the mail would be distributed on the same day it arrived in the county, moving things up by one day. On the other hand, they consulted with each agricultural cooperative, each of which would contribute an additional 50 cents per month, with plans to add one more postman per township. In this way, the newspapers could be delivered to the county and township without delay, and the cadres sent to lower levels could read the newspapers in a timely manner.

    It is hoped that the Party committees in other places can also, like the Organization Department of the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee and the Yuanyang County Committee, discover problems in a timely manner and promptly find solutions.

    及时发现及时解决
    下放干部原来在机关里，一般都有看报纸的习惯，下放到农村以后，学习的资料较少，对报纸的要求就更为迫切。但是，农村由于条件的限制，很难及时看到报纸，一般都要四五天。这个矛盾如何解决？只要关心下放干部，经常了解他们的要求和困难，就一定可以提出办法来解决。原阳县解决报纸发行的办法，就是一个证明。
    今年春节，中共河南新乡地委组织部派人到原阳去访问下放干部，发现了这个问题以后，立即和原阳县委研究出解决的办法：一方面调整了邮递班次，改变出发时间。把邮件由原来当天到县第二天才分送各乡的情况，改变成邮件到县当天就分送出去。比过去提前了一天。另一方面和各农业社协商，每社每月多出五角钱，计划每乡增加一个邮递员。这样报纸到县、到乡后就可以不停留，下放干部就可及时看到报纸。
    希望其他地方的党委，也能像新乡地委组织部和原阳县委一样，及时发现问题，及时设法解决。
