    Huangyan Uses Pine Needles, Cypress, Machilus Leaves, and Tangerine Peel to Produce Fragrant Oil for Large-Scale Export

    (Our Dispatch) The Huangyan Chemical Factory in Zhejiang Province has gone deep into the mountains to utilize wild plants such as pine needles, cypress, machilus leaves, and tangerine peels, and has produced more than twenty kinds of fragrant oils.

    The mountains and plains of western Huangyan are covered with trees and wild grasses, many of which are natural raw materials for fragrant oils. Tangerine peels and leaves contain a large amount of fragrant oil, which had not been utilized in the past. In April of last year, the Luqiao Town Party Committee, based on the suggestion of Ye Kaiyou, a local chemical technician, went to Xipaimen Mountain in the west of the county to set up a factory. After repeated experiments, pine needle oil was distilled from pine needles. After testing by the Shanghai Chemical Company, the quality was very good, and the cost was 40% lower than the products of urban factories. Later, more than ten kinds of fragrant oils, such as cypress oil, machilus leaf oil, and Citrus wilsonii leaf oil, were trial-produced using tangerine leaves and wild mountain materials, and camphor brain, a valuable raw material for preparing insecticides and sanitary agents, was extracted from cypress oil.

    The technical conditions for producing camphor brain are relatively complex, and the County Party Committee decided to build a new factory in the town to use the cypress oil produced by the mountain factory for refining. After several improvements, the solubility of the produced camphor brain caught up with that of Shanghai products. Now, the relevant departments have decided that Shanghai will temporarily stop producing camphor brain and send all the raw materials to the Huangyan Chemical Factory for unified processing. Not long ago, they also successfully trial-produced sandalwood oil.

    At present, most of the fragrant oil produced by this factory is sold abroad, in addition to meeting domestic needs.

    黄岩利用松针柏木楠叶桔皮
    制成芳香油大量出口
    本报讯　浙江省黄岩化工厂深入山区，利用松针、柏木、楠叶等野生植物和柑桔皮，制成了二十多种芳香油。
    黄岩西部山区漫山遍野的树木、野草，有很多种是芳香油的自然原料。柑桔皮、桔叶都含有大量的芳香油，过去都没有加以利用。去年4月，路桥镇委根据当地一个化工技术人员叶开友的建议，去县西牌门山办工厂。经多次试验，利用松木针叶蒸馏出松针油。经上海化工公司化验，货色很好，成本比城市工厂的出品还低40％。后来又用桔叶和山野原料试制成柏木油、楠叶油、槾桔叶油等十多种芳香油，并从柏木油中提炼出配制杀虫剂和卫生剂的一种贵重原料柏木脑。
    制柏木脑的技术条件比较复杂，县委决定在城镇新建工场，利用山区工场生产的柏木油来进行提炼。经过几次改进，制成的柏木脑的溶度赶上了上海的产品。现在，有关部门已决定上海暂时停止生产柏木脑，把全部原料送给黄岩化工厂统一加工。不久以前，他们又试制成功了香檀油。
    目前，这个厂生产的芳香油，除供国内需要外，大部分销售国外。
