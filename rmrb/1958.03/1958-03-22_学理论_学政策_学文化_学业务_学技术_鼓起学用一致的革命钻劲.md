Cadres in Pingli County, Shaanxi Province, put forward a valuable initiative

(Reported by this newspaper) All cadres in Pingli County, Shaanxi Province, proposed to all county cadres in the province to launch a socialist great competition in learning to promote a great leap forward in cadre learning.

This initiative was put forward at a recent meeting of cadres at the county, district, and township levels. In their initiative, they proposed that the overall goal of the cadre learning competition is to enable themselves to quickly become cadres who are "both red and expert" and "capable in both writing and military affairs," and strive to realize the Party Central Committee's agricultural development program and the provincial Party committee's call to "work hard for three years to change the face of the entire province" as soon as possible. In order to achieve this goal, they put forward ten specific requirements for learning in various aspects, including theory, policy, culture, business, and technology. The initiative stated that in the great leap forward of the entire people towards socialism, all cadres in Pingli County have been greatly encouraged. We are determined to rouse revolutionary vigor, and also to rouse revolutionary determination to study diligently, to launch a great leap forward in learning, to quickly become cadres who are "both red and expert" and "capable in both writing and military affairs," and strive to realize the Party Central Committee's agricultural development program and the provincial Party committee's call to "work hard for three years to change the face of the entire province" as soon as possible. To this end, the county, district, and township cadres of Pingli County have put forward the following ten requirements for themselves in learning, and have initiated a socialist competition with cadres in brother counties throughout the province:

1.  Everyone should actively participate in the study of rectification and socialist education courses. Those with a junior high school education level should also develop a plan to study other theoretical courses well after completing the socialist education courses.

2.  Each person should read at least one business book or grammar book each year (illiterates should learn at least 1,000 characters each year);

3.  Each person should learn at least one production technique each year;

4.  Each person should come up with at least one good idea each year (including creation, invention, rationalization proposals, etc.);

5.  Each person should cultivate a test plot (including individual cultivation, joint cultivation, or test points), or adopt the method of cultivating "test plots" to gain experience in leading relevant business work;

6.  Each person should subscribe to at least one newspaper;

7.  Each person should write at least one article for newspapers and periodicals each month (articles or news reports are both acceptable);

8.  Each person should write a summary of experience or typical investigation material each year;

9.  Each meeting should study at least one document related to policies and current affairs;

10. Each person should conduct a comprehensive review of their ideology, learning, and work each year.

Based on the above points, combined with each person's situation, formulate personal five-year plans and annual plans, give full play to energy, implement them conscientiously, and conduct regular inspections and evaluations.
