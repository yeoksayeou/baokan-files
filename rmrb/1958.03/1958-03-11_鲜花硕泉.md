Fresh Flowers and Abundant Fruits
	Wang Zheng Zhou Dingfang

	In recent days, the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design has taken on a completely new look. The democratic atmosphere within the institute is unprecedentedly active, and a spirit of self-criticism and mutual criticism has taken shape. Many engineers who were never accustomed to examining their own thoughts and criticizing others in public are now setting aside their reservations, embracing a receptive attitude towards criticism, posting big-character posters criticizing their own design ideas, and also criticizing others. Relationships between people are undergoing profound changes. The leap forward plans of design personnel, both red and expert, becoming redder and more expert, are dazzling. Production news arrives one after another, and astonishing miracles continue to appear. Construction costs are decreasing, and design drawings are being completed ahead of schedule. All these achievements are the brilliant flowers of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, which has spurred the technical personnel's surging enthusiasm, resulting in these abundant economic fruits.

	Deeply Rooted in People's Hearts, Facts Speak for Themselves

	After the rectification campaign in this institute transitioned into the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in design, and after widespread publicity about the significance of the movement, with mobilization meetings of all sizes both inside and outside the Party, many engineering and technical personnel stepped forward to expose waste, with a very strong momentum. However, many technical personnel still had concerns. Some engineering and technical leaders were afraid that the masses would dig up old cases, making it difficult to handle things; some were afraid of losing face by exposing shortcomings. Some young engineering and technical personnel worried that the leadership would not support their correct opinions; and they were also afraid of being held responsible later for expressing wrong opinions. More people worried that modifying the drawings would increase the workload and delay the completion of the task; they were concerned that one-sided savings would reduce quality; some were afraid that the owners and construction units would disagree, making it difficult to implement the cost-saving measures. If these concerns were not broken, the movement could not move forward by leaps and bounds. Based on this situation, the institute's leadership conducted thorough ideological work, repeatedly emphasizing that anti-waste and anti-conservatism was a major issue in comprehensively implementing the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, not about embarrassing anyone, nor about punishing anyone, but about improving work. More importantly, they firmly grasped the positive elements and resolutely supported all their positive actions. There was much waste in the engineering design of the Socialist Academy. Huang Jiali, a member of the Communist Youth League, and others wanted to expose it but feared that the project leader would not accept it. After the leadership's encouragement, Huang Jiali bravely exposed the facts of waste in this project. The first shot was fired, people's hearts were inspired, and the flood of exposing waste poured out, unstoppable.

	However, there were still a few technical personnel who held a resistant attitude towards the movement, hindering the overall development of the movement. It was necessary to launch a serious ideological struggle against them, give them appropriate criticism and specific help. One chief engineer said: "If mobilizing the masses can save money, it proves that the technical personnel did not use their brains in the past." While others were checking drawings and calculating accounts, he remained indifferent. After everyone urged him, he went to the drawing room to help others review the drawings of the Geological College's practice factory. With a cursory calculation, he realized that more than 2,000 yuan could be saved. Faced with a large number of exposed facts and with the help of the leadership, this old engineer was shocked and realized that he had fallen behind. He immediately caught up, working together with everyone to check for waste even during the Spring Festival. As a result, in his design office alone, more than 900,000 yuan of investment was saved for the country.

	The advanced became more advanced, and the backward caught up. People who originally had slight doubts in their hearts and slightly delayed actions rushed to catch up, forming a new situation of overall upsurge in the movement.

	Strengthen Technical Leadership

	In the situation of the masses rising up like a swarm and based on the principle of exposing, checking, and correcting simultaneously, the leadership of this institute timely proposed a fighting goal of saving 7 million yuan for the country. This slogan not only further encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses but also removed the ideological burden of some people who were afraid of losing face and being punished. Everyone went to the front line unburdened, checking projects item by item day and night, trying every means to save money for the country. The design of the Nationalities Palace, through everyone's efforts, saved 1.3 million yuan of national investment compared to the original plan. Moreover, it also increased the building area by 1,000 square meters compared to the original plan. After all the designers in the standard design office studied measures to reduce costs together, they finally reduced the cost per square meter of standard residential buildings from 53 yuan to 40 yuan. Each design office also sent people to study and contact the owners and construction units, working together to save investment for the country. The savings figures of each office changed several times a day, and the entire institute reached 9.23 million yuan.

	After the new cost-saving measures were proposed one after another, the leadership of this institute correctly grasped the technical leadership, firmly adhering to the technical appraisal checkpoint, and put forward the spirit that cost-saving measures should be implemented within the policy permissible and technically possible. The technical committees of each design office were responsible for reviewing the technical issues raised by their respective design offices. The chairmen of the committees were mostly the chief engineers of the office or experienced engineers. Problems that could not be resolved by the design office were handed over to the institute's technical committee for resolution. In this way, the concerns of some senior engineering and technical personnel who were afraid that the masses would rise up and make things difficult were relieved. The leadership also organized technical forces to carefully review the cost-saving measures and removed some inappropriate cost-saving measures. In this way, the savings figures were truly reliable, and the masses were guided to the correct path of technical improvement, avoiding the error of unrealistic and indiscriminate cutting.

	Dissecting a Sparrow

	If the economic accounts are clear, does the movement end? No. Judging from the facts exposed, almost every project has waste to varying degrees. This is not a simple technical issue, but the bourgeois individualistic design ideology—the idea of erecting personal monuments—that is prevalent among designers.

	In order to break the bourgeois individualistic design ideology and establish the correct proletarian design ideology, the institute held an exhibition of wasteful design drawings. Some people were so excited by the shocking waste figures that they were speechless, while others watched repeatedly, making detailed records. Among them, the waste phenomenon in the Labor Protection Exhibition Hall project was the most prominent. The designer, in order to erect his so-called "Asia's First" worker's monument, arbitrarily squandered the state's investment. Preliminary inspection revealed waste of hundreds of thousands of yuan. At the same time, everyone was organized to visit the Labor Protection Hall construction site, which was under construction, for on-site debates and practical experiences. Everyone's thinking was greatly shaken. Many people believed that this kind of thinking of erecting personal monuments was shameful. Especially after visiting the hard work of the coal miners, everyone felt that it was simply a crime to squander the wealth created by the workers and peasants.

	In order to improve people's thinking, they seized on engineer Song Xiutang's bourgeois design ideology, dissected it deeply, and promoted the overall situation through the method of dissecting a sparrow. In this way, the roots of thought were dug deeply, the shock to everyone was great, and therefore the gains were also greater.

	Engineer Song Xiutang had a resistant attitude at the beginning of the movement, believing that "the watermelon was held on his own head." After being criticized, he still insisted on his mistakes. In the Geological College Library project he designed, in order to pursue grandeur, the total area exceeded the originally approved area by more than 500 square meters. He ignored others' opinions and even used deceptive means to ask the technical director of the design office to sign it, attempting to muddle through the drawings. The institute's leadership immediately seized this typical example and conducted in-depth criticism.

	A total of five projects presided over by Song Xiutang were systematically inspected, and it was found that a total of 800,000 yuan of national investment was wasted. He believed that the standards of good architecture were: high standards and large area. It costs more money to be beautiful. He said, "Seven parts material, three parts technology," and everyone has their own techniques. His "technique" was to use expensive materials. Therefore, his design method was always to design the facade first, and then stuff the plan in. He didn't pay attention to suitability and economy, as long as he thought it looked good. For a sanatorium he designed, the owner reflected that there were many corners, many toilets, and many dark rooms. In his opinion, the facade shape was the most important part for him to erect a monument, and he would spare no expense for false decorations; while suitability and safety were irrelevant to his monument, so he was indifferent. In the auditorium roof addition project he presided over, the stage roof and the auditorium roof should have been fireproofed, but because this was a hidden part, even though the leadership instructed him, he did not implement it seriously, spending the money saved in the auditorium. As a result, a lightning strike caused a fire, causing a large amount of loss.

	Through large-scale debates, small-scale discussions, and visits to the Song Xiutang design ideology exhibition, people deeply realized the serious harm of bourgeois individualistic design ideology and felt that the idea of erecting personal monuments was extremely shameful.

	Dedicate Body and Mind to Socialism

	Song Xiutang's design ideology is a mirror. The engineering and technical personnel in the institute used this mirror to find out the problems in their own design ideology, examine their own thoughts, establish the idea of designing for the people, and make their own struggle plans. Yang Kuanlin, a 68-year-old chief engineer, pondered his plan, unable to sleep late at night. Afraid of disturbing his family's rest, he dared not turn on the lights and wrote down the main points of his plan in the dark on the bed. Chief engineer Zhang Bo wrote in his plan: "Dedicate body and mind to socialist construction." He spoke the minds of the vast majority of engineering and technical personnel in the institute. Song Xiutang also posted his own self-criticism, expressing his determination to correct his past mistakes. Under the call of the "six comparisons" slogan, everyone strove to be the first, and there was a fresh atmosphere everywhere. In less than a month, all employees of the institute worked more than 45,400 hours, accounting for 34% of the total working hours in the first quarter. At the beginning of February, the institute accepted 14 urgent factory design tasks. At first, the leadership lacked confidence in completing the tasks. After consulting with six design offices, the tasks were all snapped up, and the heads of the offices that got fewer tasks were complained about by the masses in the office. Now all the employees of this institute continue to move forward bravely with the force of a thunderbolt, and the flowers of the double-anti movement will bear more abundant leap forward fruits here.

    鲜花硕泉
    王政　周定舫
    近些天来，北京市设计院的面貌焕然一新。院内民主空气空前活跃，自我批评和相互批评的风气已经形成。许多过去从来不习惯在大庭广众之间检查自己思想、批评别人的工程师，现在都打破情面，抱着闻过则喜的态度，贴出大字报批评自己的设计思想，也批评了别人。人与人之间的关系在发生着深刻的变化。设计人员又红又专、更红更专的跃进规划琳琅满目。生产捷报一张接着一张，惊人的奇迹不断出现。建筑造价在降低，设计出图在提前。这一切成就，都是灿烂的反浪费反保守运动的鲜花，鼓起了技术人员势如潮涌的干劲，才结出的经济硕果。
    深入人心　事实说话
    这个院的整风，转入设计上的反浪费、反保守运动以后，经过广泛宣传运动的意义，党内党外，大会小会动员，许多工程技术人员挺身而出，揭发浪费，来势很猛。但是，不少技术人员还有顾虑。有的工程技术领导人员害怕群众起来重翻旧案不好办事；有的怕揭发出缺点来丢面子。有的青年工程技术人员担心领导上不支持自己正确意见；又怕说出错误意见，以后要自己负责任。更多人的顾虑是：怕修改图纸增加工作量，耽心完不成任务；怕片面节约，降低质量；有的怕业主、施工单位不同意，节约措施不好实现。这些顾虑不打破，运动就不能大步前进。院的领导根据这个情况，深入作思想工作，反复宣传反浪费反保守是全面贯彻多快好省的建设方针，是如何更好更快地建设社会主义的大问题，不是丢谁的面子，也不是要处罚谁，而是要改进工作。更重要的紧紧地抓住积极分子，坚决支持他们一切积极的行动。社会主义学院工程设计中有许多浪费，共青团员黄家礼等要揭发，又怕工程主持人不接受。经过领导鼓励，黄家礼勇敢地揭发了这个工程浪费的事实。第一炮打响了，人心振奋，揭发浪费的洪流，一泻千里，猛不可挡。
    但是，仍有少数技术人员对运动抱着抵触情绪，阻碍着运动的全面展开。这就必须对他们展开严肃的思想斗争，给以适当的批评和具体的帮助。一个总工程师说：发动群众要能够节约，就证明技术人员过去没有动脑筋。别人都查图算账，他却不闻不问。经大家催促，他才到画图室去，帮助别人审查地质学院实习工厂的图纸，只草草一算，就可节约二千多元。在大量被揭发出来的事实面前，在领导的帮助下，这位老工程师大吃一惊，认识到自己落后了，立刻急起直追，春节也不休息和大家一起检查浪费。结果在他所在的设计室，就给国家节约九十多万元投资。
    先进的更先进，落后的赶上来，原来心中稍有疑虑，行动稍稍迟缓的人纷纷猛赶上来，于是形成了运动全面高涨的新形势。
    加强技术领导
    在群众蜂涌而起的情况下，在边揭发边检查边改正的基础上，这个院的领导方面适时地提出为国家节约七百万元的奋斗目标。这个口号不仅进一步鼓舞了群众热情，并且卸掉了部分人怕丢面子，怕受处分的思想包袱，个个轻装上前线，夜以继日地逐项检查工程，千方百计为国家节约。设计中的民族宫，经过大家想办法，比原计划节约国家投资一百三十万元。而且还比原计划增加了一千平方公尺的建筑面积。标准设计室全体设计人员在一起研究降低造价的措施后，终于使标准图住宅每平方公尺造价由五十三元降低到四十元。各设计室还分别派人与业主和施工单位研究联系，共同努力为国家节约投资，各室节约数字一日数变，全院达到了九百二十三万元。
    在新的节约措施先后被提出以后，这个院的领导上正确地抓紧了技术领导，紧紧把住技术鉴定这一关，提出节约措施要贯彻政策上许可，技术上可能的精神。各设计室技术委员会负责审查本设计室所提出的技术问题，委员会的主持人大多是室内总工程师，或有经验的工程师。设计室决定不了的问题交院技术委员会解决。这样一来，便解除了部分高级工程技术人员害怕群众起来不好办事的顾虑。领导上还组织技术力量，认真的审查节约措施，去掉了一些不妥当的节约措施。这样，节约数字才是真正可靠的，而且把群众引导到技术改进的正确的道路上来，避免不实事求是胡乱削砍的错误。
    解剖麻雀
    经济账算清楚了，运动是不是就完了呢？没有。由揭发出来的事实来看，几乎是每一项工程都有不同程度的浪费，这不是单纯的技术问题，而是在设计人员中普遍存在的资产阶级个人主义设计思想——树立个人纪念碑思想——在作祟。
    为了破资产阶级个人主义的设计思想，树立正确的无产阶级的设计思想，这个院举办了一个浪费的设计图纸展览。有些人看见惊人的浪费数字激动得说不出话来，有的人三番五次地看，详细地作记录。其中劳动保护展览馆工程的浪费现象最突出。设计人为了树立自己所谓“亚洲第一”的工人纪念碑，任意挥霍国家的投资。初步检查，就浪费几十万元。同时还组织大家到正在施工中的劳保馆工地实地参观，现场辩论，实地体会，大家思想上震动很大。许多人认为：这种树立个人纪念碑思想是可耻的。特别是参观煤矿工人的艰苦劳动以后，大家感到这样挥霍工人农民创造的财富简直是有罪。
    为了提高人们的思想，他们抓住工程师宋秀棠的资产阶级设计思想，深入解剖，通过解剖麻雀的办法，推动全局。这样思想根挖的深，给大家的震动大，因此收获也就多。
    工程师宋秀棠在运动一开始就有抵触情绪，认为“抱西瓜抱到自己头上来了。”受到了批评以后，仍然坚持错误。他设计的地质学院图书馆工程，为了追求气魄，总面积比原批准面积超出五百多平方公尺。别人提意见他竟置之不理，反用欺骗手段，要求设计室技术主任签字，企图蒙混出图。院的领导立刻抓住这个典型，进行深入批判。
    一共系统地检查了五项宋秀棠主持设计的工程，检查出共浪费国家投资八十万元。他认为好建筑的标准是：标准高，面积大。要美就得多花钱，他说：“七分材料三分技术”，个人有个人的手法。他的“手法”就是能用贵重材料。因此，他的设计方法总是先设计立面，然后再塞平面，适用、经济他都不去注意，只要他认为好看就行。他设计的一个疗养院，业主反映是拐角多、厕所多、黑屋子多。在他看来，立面体型是给他树立纪念碑最重要的部分，虚伪的装饰花多少钱，他都在所不惜；而适用、安全与他树立纪念碑无关紧要，所以就漠不关心。他主持的音乐堂观众厅加顶工程，舞台屋顶与观众厅屋顶应作防火隔断，但因这是隐蔽部分，虽有领导指示，他也不认真执行，把省下来的钱花到观众厅里。结果雷击起火，造成大量损失。
    通过大会辩论，小会座谈，参观宋秀棠设计思想展览，人们深刻认识到资产阶级个人主义设计思想的严重危害性，感到树立个人纪念碑思想的极端可耻。
    把身心献给社会主义
    宋秀棠的设计思想是一面镜子，院里的工程技术人员都用这面镜子照出自己设计思想上的毛病，检查自己的思想，树立起为人民设计的思想，订出自己的奋斗规划。六十八岁的总工程师杨宽麟，捉摸自己的规划，深夜睡不着觉，又怕打搅家里人休息，不敢开灯，在床上摸黑记下自己规划的要点。总工程师张鎛，在规划上写道：要把身心献给社会主义建设。他说出了这个院广大工程技术人员的心里话。宋秀棠也贴出自己的检查，表示决心改正过去的错误。在六比口号的号召下，人人争先，到处是新鲜气象。在不到一个月的时间里，全院职工多作了四万五千四百多小时的工作，占第一季度生产总工时的34％。在二月初，这个院接受了十四个工厂设计紧急任务，开始领导上对完成任务信心不足，和六个设计室一商量，任务一抢而光，任务抢得少的室主任，还受到室里群众的埋怨。现在这个院全体职工，继续以雷霆万钧之势勇猛向前，双反的鲜花将在这里结出更丰硕的跃进之果。
