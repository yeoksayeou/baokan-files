A Collection of Poems from a Visit to Korea
Chen Yi Wrote Six Poems During the Spring Festival at the Volunteer Army Headquarters

I. On the Way to the Volunteer Army Headquarters
	Late at night, crossing mountain cliffs in snow,
	The convoy roared like thunder, speeding on.
	Villages and houses appeared in a continuous row,
	As if returning from old battles fought and won.

II. New Year's Eve Celebration
	Joyful drinking, sipping lightly, toasting friends,
	I am an old soldier, hair turned white.
	An even older guest was among us,
	Delighting in generous drinks, lively as a dragon tonight.

III. Toast to Korean Comrades
	Respectful toast to the brothers of China and Korea,
	The friendship forged in battle grows stronger day by day.
	This evening, enjoying Spring Festival wine,
	The Volunteer Army toasts the Korean People's Army this way.

IV. Another Toast
	The Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army,
	Our battle friendship is most intimate and dear.
	We are all unparalleled heroes,
	Protecting our homes and defending our nation, soldiers so near.

V. Paying Respects to Martyrs' Cemetery in Snow
	Martyrs' graves lined up in rows,
	A sky full of snow honors loyal souls.
	Helping others, helping ourselves, protecting our homes and country,
	Generations will pay homage to these role models.

VI. Rejoicing at the Magnificent Scale of the Volunteer Army Headquarters
	Having been away from the army for several years, unaware,
	Today, I rest my feet at the Volunteer Army Headquarters.
	Modern equipment shines brilliantly,
	Reminds me that I once led a spear division, my dear.

(Note) In the spring of 1928, I served as the commander of the Red Army's 12th Division. The division had over 5,000 men, but only a hundred or so rifles. The rest were spears, so it was called the "Spear Division."

    访问朝鲜诗录
    陈毅在志愿军司令部度春节得诗六首一、赴志司途中夜深乘雪渡山崖，车队纷驰吼若雷。前村后舍观如堵，仿佛旧日作战回。二、除夕欢饮浅斟细酌会宾朋，我是颁白一老戎。座上更有年迈客，喜他豪饮活如龙。三、向朝鲜同志
    敬酒朝中两国弟兄亲，战斗友谊日日增。此夕畅饮春节酒，志愿军敬人民军。四、再进酒
    志愿军与人民军，
    战斗友谊最相亲。
    都是豪雄无双士，
    保家卫国子弟兵。五、乘雪瞻拜烈士
    墓园
    烈士墓园座座坟，
    漫天大雪祭忠魂。
    助人自助保家国，
    世世代代拜典型。六、喜志司规模雄
    壮整齐
    离队数年不自知，
    今日歇脚在志司。
    现代装备辉煌甚，
    忆我曾长梭标师。
    （注）1928年春，我出任红军十二师师长。该师五千余人，仅有步枪百余枝，余尽梭标，人称梭标师。
