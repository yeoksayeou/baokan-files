Xinhua News Agency special dispatch, March 3rd: Beijing municipal state organs are beginning to break through the stagnant and backward situation of the recent rectification movement and are rapidly catching up by launching an anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement.

The first to take action were the Beijing Municipal Sewerage Engineering Bureau, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate, and the Beijing Municipal Handicraft Production Cooperative Union. In one day and night, these three units posted hundreds of big-character posters exposing and criticizing waste and conservative phenomena. Now, the vast majority of cadres in dozens of organs directly under the Municipal People's Committee have joined the movement.

From the initial revelations, the phenomena of waste and conservative thinking in Beijing municipal organs are quite serious. The Handicraft Production Cooperative Union suffered losses of more than 247,000 yuan due to stockpiling and waste, including interest paid. Staff at the Construction Engineering Bureau revealed that the bureau's more than 1,700 machines had an average utilization rate of only 39.5%.

Many engineering and technical personnel in various organs actively searched for information, made calculations, and used slide rules to expose waste and conservative phenomena. Yang Kaiyu, an engineer in the Sewerage Engineering Technical Office, conducted a technical and economic analysis of the structure of sewage pipes. He posted a big-character poster proposing to eliminate "pipe seats" and "sleeves" and instead use tongue-and-groove reinforced pipes, which could save 30% of the cost of sewage pipes. Zheng Dezhang, an engineer at the bureau, posted a big-character poster entitled "Due to Conservative Thinking, One Hundred Tons of Steel Bars Are Wasted Every Year." He wrote: Shanghai does not add steel bars to pipes below 60 centimeters, but we add steel bars to pipes above 40 centimeters. The thickness of the pipes, the amount of cement used, and the manufacturing methods are similar, but we dare not use [the Shanghai method]. Isn't this conservative thinking at play?

Currently, there are still a few units in Beijing municipal organs that are moving slowly and have not yet taken action.

### 突破落后局面  北京市级机关展开双反运动

    突破落后局面
    北京市级机关展开双反运动
    本报特约新华社3日专稿  北京市级国家机关开始突破最近整风运动停滞不前的落后局面，正在急起直追，展开反浪费反保守运动。
    首先行动起来的是北京市上下水道工程局、北京市检察院和北京市手工业生产合作社联合总社。这三个单位一昼夜就贴出了揭露和批评浪费、保守现象的大字报数百张。现在，市人民委员会直属的几十个机关的绝大多数干部都已投入运动。
    从初步揭发的情况看来，北京市级机关的浪费现象和保守思想是相当严重的。手工业生产合作社联合总社由于积压浪费连同所付利息，达二十四万七千多元。建筑工程局工作人员揭露了这个局的一千七百多台机器，平均利用率只有39.5％。
    许多机关的工程技术人员积极找资料、打算盘、拉算尺，揭发浪费和保守现象。上下水道工程技术室工程师杨开宇，对污水管的结构进行了技术和经济分析计算，贴出大字报提议取消“管座”和“套环”，改用企口加固管，可以节省污水管的造价30％。这个局的郑德张工程师贴出了题为“由于保守思想，每年浪费一百吨钢筋”的大字报，他写道：上海制六十公分以下的管子都不加钢筋，而我们四十公分以上的管子就加钢筋，管子的厚度、水泥用量和制造方法都差不多，我们就不敢用，这不是保守思想作怪吗？
    现在，北京市级机关仍有少数单位还慢吞吞地没有行动起来。
