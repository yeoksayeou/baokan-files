Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 27th: The No. 1 blast furnace of the Zhejiang Steel Plant, which is under construction, has been completed and began producing iron on the 26th.

    This steel plant, built in Banshan area of Hangzhou County, officially started construction in August last year. In order to accelerate the progress of the project, the plant adopted the method of surveying, designing, constructing, and preparing materials simultaneously during the construction process; all employees also boosted their enthusiasm and put forward a large number of rationalization proposals. Therefore, in a little more than half a year, they completed the workload that usually takes at least two years, and also saved the country 1.27 million yuan in investment.

    According to preliminary plans, by 1962, the Zhejiang Steel Plant will be built into an iron and steel complex with an annual output of 300,000 tons of pig iron, 240,000 tons of steel, and 200,000 tons of steel products. At that time, Zhejiang's steel needs can not only be supplied locally, but also support other regions.

    浙江钢铁厂出铁
    新华社杭州27日电正在兴建中的浙江钢铁厂一号高炉，已经建成并在26日开始出铁。
    这座建设在杭县半山地区的钢铁厂，是在去年8月正式施工的。为了加速工程的进度，这个厂在建设过程中，曾采取了边勘测、边设计、边施工、边备料的办法；全体职工也鼓起了干劲，提出了大量的合理化建议。因此，在半年多一点的时间内，就完成了平时至少需要二年完成的工作量，还为国家节约了一百二十七万元的投资。
    根据初步规划，到1962年，浙江钢铁厂将建设成为一座年产三十万吨生铁、二十四万吨钢、二十万吨钢材的钢铁联合企业。那时，浙江所需钢铁不仅可以就地得到供应，还可以支援其它地区。
