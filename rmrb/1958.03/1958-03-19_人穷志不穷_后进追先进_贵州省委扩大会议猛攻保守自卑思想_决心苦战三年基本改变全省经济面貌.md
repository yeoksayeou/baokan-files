(Our Guiyang Dispatch) Reporter Xiao Ming reports: The Fifth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, held in February, issued an inspiring call to the province: work hard for three years to fundamentally change Guizhou's economic outlook.

　　In agriculture, strive to achieve the main targets of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule in five years or a little more. After three years of hard work, the rural areas of the province should become affluent rural areas with large surpluses of grain, meat, and abundant timber.

　　On the industrial front, the primary issue is to build small factories and mines on a large scale and in accordance with local conditions. Universally establish small hydropower stations. It is necessary to mobilize the whole party to run industry and the whole people to run industry. Try every means to increase the output value of local industry in the province sevenfold in five years or a little more (the current output value is 430 million).

　　Within three years, eliminate the four pests and malaria throughout the province.

　　This meeting lasted eleven days, and the discussion of formulating plans and criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking was intertwined. The meeting believed that the reason why many people are slow to shake off the right-leaning baggage is because "the doctrine of the mean" is stubbornly entangled in the depths of their thinking. In their work, they are afraid of being too "left" and too "right," always emphasizing "stability," fearing that lower-level cadres are "reckless," fearing that the masses are "blindly acting," and often half-believing in the creativity of the masses. At the meeting, someone drew a vivid portrait of this "doctrine of the mean": "Do not seek to be advanced, but seek stability; not as good as the top, but better than the bottom; want to move forward, but fear rashness; want to carry out movements, but fear movements; leading the masses, but do not believe in the masses." The meeting conducted a profound criticism of this thinking. It pointed out that holding this idea for a long time will cause revolutionaries to lose their revolutionary vigor, become vulgar and cautious gentlemen, become stumbling blocks in the way of progress, and will eventually be swept away by the waves of the mass movement.

　　According to the materials revealed at the meeting, there are some people who more or less possess this kind of thinking among cadres at all levels. Some people, because they have participated in several anti-right-leaning conservatism and rash advance movements, regard this as an inevitable law of the development of things. People who hold this view, when others attack their right-leaning conservative thinking, do not examine their own thinking, do not go to the masses to identify their thinking, but painstakingly record materials, preparing to oppose others' rash advances in the future.

　　Guizhou is located in a mountainous area known for its poverty, which has caused some people to have a long-term sense of inferiority of "poor in material, poor in aspiration." They always think that poor places cannot do great things and cannot produce advanced things. Therefore, they do not pay attention to studying, summarizing, and promoting advanced things in the province, and even regard good things in the province as bad things. Private schools are the most numerous in Guizhou, which is a poor method created by poor places. However, for a considerable period of time, some people regarded this as a bad thing. This kind of thinking makes many people lack creativity and confidence in their work. The meeting proposed: to be ambitious despite poverty, to go against the current, and strive to be the best; to believe in the promoting effect of subjective forces on objective things, and that latecomers will surpass the old-timers.

　　The meeting also conducted in-depth and detailed discussions on the favorable factors and difficult conditions for striving to achieve the main targets of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule in five years or a little more, and for making the industrial output value catch up with the agricultural output value. The meeting believed that the most important condition for ensuring the realization of this leap-forward target is the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses and cadres at all levels. The high tide of the production movement in the past few months has fully demonstrated the greatest enthusiasm and confidence of the broad masses and cadres in the great leap forward in agriculture. The meeting believed that this is the most fundamental driving force for organizing the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. Secondly, although Guizhou is still an economically backward province compared with the whole country, the economic and cultural outlook of Guizhou has undergone tremendous changes compared with before liberation due to the implementation of the correct policies of the Party Central Committee and the active efforts of the broad masses of the people. Guizhou was originally a grain-deficient area, but has become a surplus grain area in recent years; there is also a surplus in pork supply, and the industrial outlook has also developed from a blank area before liberation to a local industrial output value (including industries delegated by the central government and handicrafts) of more than 430 million yuan, accounting for 20.5% of the total industrial and agricultural output value, and has initially taken shape, with both light and heavy industries. Thirdly, although Guizhou is poor, this is only a relative and temporary phenomenon, because resources have not been developed. Before liberation, some geologists who did not conduct in-depth and comprehensive surveys and explorations of Guizhou erroneously asserted that Guizhou "has no coal three feet thick." Now, after exploration, it has been proven that the coal reserves in the Qianxi area alone amount to 67 billion tons, with coal seams reaching 20 to 30 meters thick, and the varieties are complete. Some people describe it as becoming Shanxi south of the Yangtze River. Guizhou also has underground reserves of other minerals such as copper, iron, gold, lead, zinc, tin, antimony, mercury, manganese, phosphorus, tungsten, and oil shale. This is the most valuable condition for developing industry.

　　The meeting also especially emphasized that the rectification campaign must be carried out to the end, further change the work style, and eliminate officialdom, arrogance, and stagnation.

### 人穷志不穷　后进追先进  贵州省委扩大会议猛攻保守自卑思想  决心苦战三年基本改变全省经济面貌

    人穷志不穷　后进追先进
    贵州省委扩大会议猛攻保守自卑思想
    决心苦战三年基本改变全省经济面貌
    本报贵阳电　记者萧明报道：2月间举行的中共贵州省委第五次全体会议（扩大），向全省提出振奋人心的号召：苦战三年，基本改变贵州经济面貌。
    在农业方面，争取在五年或者稍多一点的时间内，提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的主要指标。苦战三年就要使全省农村成为有大量余粮、余肉和丰富木材的富足的农村。
    在工业战线上，首要的问题是大量地、因地制宜地建设小型厂矿。普遍建立小型水力发电站。要动员全党办工业、全民办工业。想尽一切办法，争取在五年或稍多一点时间内，使全省地方工业的产值增加七倍（目前的产值是四亿三千万）。
    三年内，要在全省范围内消灭四害，消灭疟疾。
    这次会议历时十一天，讨论制订规划和批判右倾保守思想是交错进行的。会议认为：很多人所以迟迟丢不开右倾包袱，是由于在他们的思想深处顽固地纠缠着“中庸之道”。他们在工作中怕左又怕右，总是强调“稳当”，怕下边干部“冒失”，怕群众“盲动”，对群众的创造常常半信半疑。会议上，有人给这种“中庸之道”，绘了一幅生动的面像：“不求先进，但求稳当；比上不足，比下有余；既要前进，又怕冒进；想搞运动，又怕运动；领导群众，不信群众”。会议对这种思想进行了深刻的批判。并指出：抱着这种思想长此下去，它将使革命者失去革命朝气，变成庸俗的谨小慎微的君子，成为前进中的绊脚石，终要被群众运动的浪涛冲垮。
    根据会议上揭发的材料，在各级干部中都有一些或多或少存在这种思想的人。有一些人，因为他们曾参加过数次反右倾保守和急躁冒进，就把这看成了事物发展的必然规律。持有这种观点的人，在别人向他们的右倾保守思想进攻的时候，他们不去检查自己的思想，不到群众中去对自己思想进行鉴定，却煞费苦心地记录材料，准备以后反别人的冒进。
    贵州处在一个素称贫穷的山区，因而使一些人长时期抱有“人穷志穷”的自卑感。他们总认为穷地方办不了大事，出不了先进。因而，他们对本省的先进事物不注意研究、总结和推广，甚至把本省的好事也看成坏事。民办小学，贵州办得最多，这是穷地方创造的穷办法。但在一个相当长时间里，有些人却把这看成不好的事情。这种思想使很多人在工作中缺乏创造性和信心。会议提出：要人穷志气高，要逆水行舟，力争上游；要相信主观力量对客观事物的促进作用，后来者也会居上。
    会议对争取五年或更多一点时间内，提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的主要指标，并使工业产值赶上农业产值的有利因素与困难条件，也进行了深入细致的讨论。会议认为，首先保证实现这个跃进指标的最重要的条件，是广大群众与各级干部的社会主义积极性。从几个月生产运动的高潮中，已充分表现了广大群众和干部对农业跃进的最大热情和信心。会议认为这就是组织工农业大跃进的最基本的动力。其次，贵州和全国比起来，虽还是个经济发展落后的省份；但由于执行了党中央的正确方针，和广大人民群众积极努力，贵州的经济文化面貌与解放前相比，已发生巨大变化。贵州原是个缺粮地区，几年来已成为余粮地区；猪肉供应也有剩余，工业面貌也从解放前的空白地区，发展到地方工业（包括中央下放工业和手工业）产值达四亿三千多万元，占工农业总产值的20.5％，而且已初具规模，轻、重工业兼备。再其次，贵州虽贫穷，但这只是相对的暂时现象，是由于资源没有开发。解放前，一些对贵州没有进行深入全面考察勘探的地质学家，错误地断言贵州“煤无三尺厚”。而现在经过勘探证明，仅黔西一带煤的蕴藏量即达六百七十亿吨，煤层达二十到三十公尺厚，而且品种齐全。有人形容说，这里将成为长江以南的山西。其他如铜、铁、黄金、铅、锌、锡、锑、汞、锰、磷、钨、油页岩等，贵州地下也有蕴藏。这是发展工业最难得的条件。
    会议还特别强调指出，一定要把整风贯彻到底，进一步改变作风，打掉官气，骄气和暮气。
