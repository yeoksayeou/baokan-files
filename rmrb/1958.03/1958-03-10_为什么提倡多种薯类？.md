    Why Advocate for Multiple Varieties of Potatoes?
    Zeng Ling
    Article 10 of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) proposes: "Based on needs and dietary habits, appropriately develop high-yield crops such as corn and potatoes." The role of increasing potato crop production is a significant issue of concern to everyone. I would now like to offer some preliminary thoughts on this matter.

      The State of Potato Production in China

    Since liberation, the planting area and yield of potato crops in China have grown the fastest among food production. From 1949 to 1956, the planting area for food production in China increased from 1.52 billion mu to 1.86 billion mu, an increase of 22%. Among them, rice increased by 30%, wheat increased by 27%, miscellaneous grains increased by 11%, and potatoes increased by 57%. Food production increased from 216.1 billion jin to 365 billion jin, an increase of approximately 70%, with rice production increasing by 69%, wheat production by 80%, miscellaneous grains by 49%, and potatoes by 122%. In the various grain yields of 1956, fresh potato production reached 174.8 billion jin. Calculated at four jin of potatoes to one jin of grain, this totaled 43.7 billion jin of grain, equivalent to about 12% of the total grain production, a significant increase from the level of approximately 9% that potato crops accounted for in grain production in 1949.

    Developing potato crops is of great significance to improving China's grain supply situation. This is because potato crops have the following three advantages:

    I. High yield per unit area. In 1956, the average yield per mu of various grains in China was 330 jin for rice, 121 jin for wheat, 135 jin for miscellaneous grains, and 265 jin (converted to grain) for potatoes, second only to rice. Currently, many regions in China have seen large-scale high-yield examples with yields of over 10,000 jin of fresh potatoes per mu, with the highest even reaching 20,000 to 30,000 jin of fresh potatoes per mu. However, the current national average yield of potatoes per mu is relatively low, which indicates that there is still great potential for increasing production.

    II. Potato crops have a wide range of adaptability. They can be planted in the south and north, in colder or warmer regions; they can be planted in various soils such as mountainous areas, sandy land, dry land, and paddy fields; and they can be planted after winter crops, which can further utilize land fertility and increase production.

    III. Many uses. Sweet potatoes and potatoes contain approximately 20% starch, approximately 1%-2% crude protein, as well as cellulose, ash, and large amounts of vitamin C. Therefore, potato crops are suitable for people to use as vegetables or supplementary food, are good livestock feed, and are also excellent raw materials for producing large quantities of starch, alcohol, and liquor. Recently, Chengdu and other places in Sichuan Province have already used sweet potatoes to make eight categories and one hundred forty-two kinds of palatable foods such as various liquors, noodles, soy sauce, vinegar, candies, pastries, dishes, and home-style snacks, which are welcomed by urban and rural people.

    However, up to now, China's potato production is still basically for farmers' self-sufficiency. The proportion of commodity potatoes and the amount used as raw materials for processing industrial production are not large. This fact shows that it is necessary to appropriately develop potato production.

      The Role of Increasing Potato Production

    Currently, China's annual grain output has reached 370 billion jin, greatly exceeding the historical high of over 270 billion jin, and the grain consumption situation for the vast majority of working people has improved. However, the contradiction between agricultural production (primarily grain production) not keeping up with the needs of industrial development and not keeping up with the needs of the continuous improvement of people's material lives is still very significant. This is an inevitable phenomenon for an agricultural country undergoing socialist industrialization.

    China's average per capita arable land is small, grain production is not high, and the rate of grain production increase is slow. China's population is increasing rapidly, and socialist industrialization is developing rapidly. Therefore, the following situations will inevitably arise in agricultural production: the contradiction between grain crops and technical crops in terms of planting area; the contradiction between the need for more commodity grain and the slower rate of grain production increase; the contradiction between human food and the feed needed to develop livestock production; and the need to gradually increase and enrich China's grain reserves, etc.

    The fundamental way to solve China's grain difficulties is, of course, to gradually realize agricultural modernization on the basis of agricultural collectivization. However, in order to appropriately improve the grain situation in the short term, massively increasing potato crop production to promote the increase in grain and technical crops and to develop animal husbandry may be an important step.

    If efforts can be made to expand the planting area of potato crops and increase the yield per unit area of potatoes, achieving an annual increase of 50 billion jin or more of potatoes (raw grain) in the short term could have the following positive effects on the entire national economy.

    I. Massively increasing feed supply is conducive to the development of animal husbandry. Potatoes are a very good feed for livestock, especially pigs and cattle.

    II. Massively supplying the processing industry, making potatoes the main raw material for the liquor and alcohol, starch, and other processing industries. This can both supply domestic needs and appropriately export for sale. Under China's current conditions, using potatoes as raw materials for manufacturing starch and making liquor can not only save a large amount of grain, but also ensure that the processing industry obtains a large supply of economical raw materials.

    III. Encouraging people to eat slightly more potatoes is conducive to saving the consumption of rice, flour, and miscellaneous grains, and can appropriately increase the state and farmers' grain reserves. If the people of the whole country can consume two to three liang more potatoes per person per day and reduce one liang of staple food, 13 to 14 billion jin of grain can be saved annually.

    The important role of potato crops can also be explained by the actual experience of grain production in regions with large populations and little arable land in China. For example, in Shandong Province, a 1954 survey showed that the average per capita arable land was 2.6 mu, slightly lower than the national average of 2.7 mu per person. However, Shandong has more dry land and mountainous land. At that time, irrigable arable land accounted for more than 25% of the country, while Shandong only had about 2%. At the same time, Shandong planted a lot of technical crops. Despite this, Shandong can not only be self-sufficient in grain in normal years, but also has a surplus. Why? The main reason is that Shandong plants more potatoes and plants them well.

    The proportion of potatoes in the grain planting area is about 9% nationwide. Shandong Province and Sichuan Province both account for about 15%, and Guangdong Province accounts for 19%. This shows that the more densely populated and land-scarce the region, the more important potato production becomes.

    Comparing China with several socialist brother countries in Europe, in 1956, China's average per capita potato planting area was 0.26 mu, the Soviet Union in 1937 was 0.61 mu, Poland in 1950 was 1.47 mu, the German Democratic Republic in 1948 was 0.56 mu, and Czechoslovakia in 1953 was 0.77 mu. In terms of average potato yield per mu: China was 1,060 jin, the Soviet Union was 1,272 jin, Poland was 2,006 jin, the Democratic Republic of Germany was 2,178 jin, and Czechoslovakia was 2,026 jin. In terms of average potato production per person: China was 278 jin, the Soviet Union was 776 jin, Poland was 2,950 jin, the Democratic Republic of Germany was 1,220 jin, and Czechoslovakia was 1,560 jin. The average per capita arable land in the Soviet Union and Poland is much larger than ours (their average grain planting area is about 9 mu per person), and the average per capita arable land in Germany and Czechoslovakia is close to ours, but their average per capita potato production is much higher than ours. Even after China increases potato production by 50 billion jin, the average per capita potato production level in China is still far behind that of the four brother countries such as the Soviet Union. Their experience in economically using arable land to plant high-yield crops is worth learning from.

      Measures to be Taken

    In order to promote the increase in potato crop production, preliminary considerations suggest that the following measures should be taken:

    I. Expand the potato planting area and increase the yield per unit area of potatoes. In the agricultural production increase plan, the potato planting area should be expanded as much as possible through the method of expanding multiple cropping. Consideration can also be given to reducing the planting area of some grain crops with lower yields per unit area. It is necessary to strengthen scientific research and guidance on potato crops and vigorously promote the potato high-yield experience of labor models and advanced farmers.

    II. Establish and strengthen the socialist commerce management of potato crops. State-owned and cooperative commerce correctly and massively managing potato crops is a decisive link in ensuring the increase in potato production. In 1932 and 1937, socialist commerce in the Soviet Union managed about 10 million tons of potatoes, equivalent to about 40% of its total grain management in that year.

    A reasonable price policy is a decisive key to encouraging people to plant more potatoes, use more potatoes, and eat more potatoes. The purchase price to farmers must be conducive to production. The selling price of two and a half jin of potatoes must be lower than the price of one jin of grain in order to encourage people to eat more potatoes. If potatoes are used as feed, it must be profitable for farmers who use potatoes to raise pigs.

    III. Develop the processing industry using potatoes as raw materials. Promote the experience of Sichuan Province in using potatoes to make various kinds of foods; develop the experience of Guangdong, Shandong, Hebei, and other places in using potatoes to make vermicelli, starch noodles, starch, liquor, and alcohol. Locate these processing industry factories close to potato-producing areas in order to promote the development of these processing industries.

    IV. Strengthen the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of various regions, especially various cities, for developing potato production. In various cities in China, especially large and medium-sized cities, a certain amount of agricultural area should be designated, and the foundation for potato crop and animal husbandry production should be established accordingly within a certain period of time. The state stipulates a certain amount of potato supply, relying on the potato production in its own suburbs to solve it, while correspondingly reducing a part of the grain supply. This can reduce the difficulty of long-distance transportation and centralized storage of potatoes, and can appropriately reduce the selling price of potatoes and reduce operating losses.

    为什么提倡多种薯类？
    曾凌
    全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）第十条提出：“根据需要和民食习惯，适当地发展玉米和薯类等高产作物”。增产薯类作物的作用，是大家所关心的重要问题之一。现在我就这个问题提出一些不成熟的意见。
      我国薯类生产的情况
    解放后，我国薯类作物的播种面积和产量在粮食生产中增长得最快。从1949年到1956年，我国粮食生产的播种面积从十五点二亿亩增至十八点六亿亩，上升了22％。其中稻谷增加30％，小麦增加27％，杂粮增加11％，薯类增加57％。粮食产量从二千一百六十一亿斤增至三千六百五十亿斤，上升约70％，其中稻谷增产69％，小麦增产80％，杂粮增产49％，薯类增产了122％。1956年的各种粮食产量中，鲜薯产量达一千七百四十八亿斤，以四斤薯折一斤粮计，共折合粮食四百三十七亿斤，相当于粮食总产量的12％左右，较1949年薯类作物仅占粮食生产的9％左右的水平增长了很多。
    发展薯类作物，对改善我国粮食供应情况有很大意义。因为薯类作物具有如下三个优点：
    一、单位面积产量大。1956年我国各种粮食的单位面积产量，平均每亩稻谷为三百三十斤，小麦为一百二十一斤，杂粮为一百三十五斤，薯类折粮为二百六十五斤，仅次于稻谷。目前我国很多地区出现了亩产鲜薯万斤以上的大面积丰产的事例，最高的甚至亩产鲜薯二、三万斤。而目前全国薯类每亩平均产量比较低，这说明还有很大的增产潜力。
    二、薯类作物的适应性很广。在南方、北方、较寒或较暖的地区可以栽种；在山地、沙地、旱田、水田等各种土壤都能栽种；并且可以栽种在冬季作物之后，这就更可以发挥地力，增加生产。
    三、用处很多。红薯与马铃薯大约含有20％左右的淀粉，约1％—2％的粗蛋白质，还有纤维素、灰分和大量的丙种维生素。所以薯类作物，宜于人们作为菜蔬或辅助食粮之用，是良好的牲畜饲料，同时又是大量制造淀粉、酒精和酒的良好原料。最近四川省成都等地已经用甘薯作成各种酒、挂面、酱油、醋、糖果、糕点、菜肴、家常小吃等八类一百四十二种可口的食品，受到城乡人民的欢迎。
    但是，截至目前为止，我国的薯类生产，基本上还是属于农民自给的性质，商品部分的比例和用作加工工业生产原料之用的数量是不大的。这个事实说明，需要适当发展薯类生产。
      增产薯类的作用
    目前我国粮食的年产量已达到了三千七百亿斤，大大超过了历史上年产二千七百余亿斤的最高水平，绝大多数劳动人民的粮食消费情况都有了改善。但是，农业生产（首要的是粮食生产）赶不上工业发展的需要，赶不上人民物质生活不断改善的需要的矛盾还是十分显著的。这是一个农业国在进行社会主义工业化建设时期所必然发生的现象。
    我国平均每人的耕地面积少，粮食产量不高，粮食增产的速度较慢。我国人口的增殖较快，社会主义工业化建设发展迅速，因而在农业生产上就必然会产生以下情况：粮食作物与技术作物在播种面积上的矛盾；商品粮需要较多与粮食增产速度较慢的矛盾；人的食粮与发展畜牧生产所需饲料的矛盾；以及我国的粮食储备需要逐步增加充实的问题等等。
    谋求解决我国粮食困难的根本出路，当然是在农业合作化的基础上逐步实行农业的现代化。但为了能够在短期内就能适当地改善粮食问题的状况，大量增产薯类作物以促进粮食和技术作物增产和发展畜牧业，可能是一个重要的步骤。
    如果能够从扩大薯类作物的播种面积和提高薯类的单位面积产量两方面努力，在短期内实现每年增产薯类（原粮）五百亿斤或者更多一些，对整个国民经济就可能产生如下的积极作用。
    一、大量增加饲料供应，有利于畜牧业的发展。薯类是牲畜特别是猪和牛的很好的饲料。
    二、大量供应加工工业，使薯类成为制酒和制造酒精、淀粉等加工工业的主要原料。这既可供应国内需要还可以适当出口外销。在我国目前的条件下，用薯类作为制造淀粉和制酒的原料，不仅可以大量地节约粮食，同时又能保证加工工业得到大量经济的原料供应。
    三、鼓励人民稍为多吃一些薯，有利于节约大米、面粉和杂粮的消费，可以适当的增加国家和农民的粮食储备。假如全国人民能够每人每日多消费二至三两薯类，减少一两主粮，每年即可节约粮食一百三、四十亿斤。
    薯类作物的重要作用，也可以从我国人口较多，耕地较少的地区粮食生产的实际经验中得到说明。例如山东省，1954年调查每人平均有耕地二点六亩，略低于全国平均每人二点七亩的水平。但山东旱地多、山地多，当时全国能灌溉的耕地占25％以上，山东则不过2％左右。同时山东的技术作物种得不少。虽然如此，山东在一般的年景下，粮食不仅可以自给，而且还有节余，为什么呢？山东薯类种得较多，种得较好，是主要原因之一。
    薯类在粮食种植面积所占的比重，全国为9％左右，山东省、四川省均占15％左右，广东省要占到19％。这说明，越是在人多地少的地区，薯类生产越显得重要。
    如将我国与欧洲几个社会主义兄弟国家比较，1956年我国平均每人的薯类播种面积为零点二六亩，苏联1937年为零点六一亩，波兰1950年为一点四七亩，德意志民主共和国1948年为零点五六亩，捷克斯洛伐克1953年为零点七七亩。就平均每亩薯产量看：我国为一千零六十斤，苏联为一千二百七十二斤，波兰为二千零六斤，民主德国为二千一百七十八斤，捷克斯洛伐克为二千零二十六斤。就平均每人产薯量看：我国为二百七十八斤，苏联为七百七十六斤，波兰为二千九百五十斤，民主德国为一千二百二十斤，捷克斯洛伐克为一千五百六十斤。苏、波两国平均每人的耕地面积较我多得多（其粮食种植面积平均每人在九亩左右），德、捷两国平均每人的耕地与我接近，但他们平均每人的薯类生产都比我们多得多，即使在我国增产五百亿斤薯之后，我国平均每人产薯水平和苏联等四个兄弟国家比较，还是相差很远的，他们这种经济使用耕地多种高产作物的经验，值得我们学习。
      应采取的几项措施
    为了促进薯类作物的增产，初步考虑似应采取如下各项措施：
    一、扩大薯类播种面积与提高薯类的单位面积产量。在农业增产计划中，似应尽可能的通过扩大复种的方法以扩大薯类播种面积，还可以考虑减少一部分单位面积产量较低的粮食作物的播种面积。需要加强对薯类作物的科学研究和指导，大力推广劳动模范、先进农民的薯类丰产经验。
    二、建立和加强社会主义商业对薯类作物的经营。国营、合作商业，正确地大量地经营薯类，这是保证薯类增产的决定性的环节。苏联在1932年和1937年的社会主义商业均曾经营马铃薯一千万吨左右，相当于其当年经营粮食总量的40％左右。
    合理的价格政策，是鼓励人民多种薯、多用薯、多吃薯的决定性的关键。向农民的收购价，必需有利于生产；使二斤半薯的销售价格要低于一斤粮食的价格，才能鼓励人民多食一些薯。如用薯作为饲料，必需使用薯养猪的农民有利可得。
    三、发展以薯类为原料的加工工业。推广四川省用薯制各种各样食品的经验；发展广东、山东、河北等地用薯制做成粉条、粉丝、淀粉、酒和酒精的经验。使这些加工工业工厂与产薯的地方接近，以便促进这些加工工业的发展。
    四、加强各地特别是各个城市对发展薯类生产的责任心和积极性。在我国各个城市，特别是大、中城市的周围，均应划出一定数量的农业地区，在一定的时期内，相应地建立薯类作物和畜牧业生产的基础。国家规定一定量的薯类供应，依靠其自己的郊区的薯类生产来解决，同时相应的减少一部分粮食供应，这样就可以减少薯类的远程运输和集中保管的困难，就可以适当的降低薯类的销售价格，减少经营亏损。
