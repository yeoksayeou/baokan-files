Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, March 13th: Lebanese officials announced that the Lebanese cabinet headed by Solh resigned on the 12th.

According to Western news agencies, the resignation is related to the difficulties encountered by the Solh government's pro-Western foreign policy, particularly the "pressure" from the new situation after the establishment of the United Arab Republic.

According to a report in the Syrian "Al-Nour" on the 12th, representatives of the Lebanese National Front, the Socialist Progressive Party, the Supporters Party, the Lebanese National Congress Party, the Constitutional Party, the National Bloc Party, and other non-partisan Lebanese nationalists recently held a meeting in Beirut. The meeting issued a statement on the 11th condemning the current policies of the Lebanese government and demanding a change in these policies to align them with the Arab liberation policy.

The statement said that the Lebanese government's policies have seriously damaged relations with its sister country Syria and have led to the loss of most of Lebanon's markets. The statement expressed support for the overall policies of the United Arab Republic.

    黎巴嫩索勒哈内阁辞职
    据新华社13日讯  贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩官方宣布，以索勒哈为首的黎巴嫩内阁在12日辞职。
    据西方通讯社消息说，这次辞职同索勒哈政府执行的亲西方外交政策遭到了困难，特别是在阿拉伯联合共和国成立以后产生的新局势的“压力”有关。
    另据叙利亚“光明报”12日报道，黎巴嫩民族阵线、社会主义进步党、支持者党、黎巴嫩国民大会党、立宪党、民族集团党和黎巴嫩其他无党派民族主义者的代表，最近在贝鲁特举行了会议。会议在11日发表一项声明，谴责黎巴嫩政府目前的政策，并且要求改变这种政策，使它同阿拉伯解放政策相符合。
    声明说，黎巴嫩政府的政策严重地损害了同它的姊妹国家叙利亚之间的关系，并且使黎巴嫩的大部分市场都丧失了。声明表示支持阿拉伯联合共和国的总的政策。
