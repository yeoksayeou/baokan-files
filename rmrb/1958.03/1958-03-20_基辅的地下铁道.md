    The Kiev Subway
    Anyone who visits Moscow always wants to see the subway. The stations of the Moscow subway, which are world-famous for their beauty, are truly like underground palaces. From the reliefs to the shape of the lamps, everything is carefully designed by artists, and each station has a different decoration and its own style. Are there subways in other Soviet cities? In addition to Leningrad, Kiev is the third city in the Soviet Union to have this form of transportation, and its construction has just begun. The capital of the Ukrainian Republic will be the third city in the Soviet Union to have a subway.
    On the high banks of the Dnieper River, you can already see the entrance to a huge underground tunnel. This is the starting point of the first line of the Kiev subway. This line is more than nine kilometers long. Although there is no activity on the surface, work is seething underground day and night. In the construction work, the workers adopted the new so-called "Kiev method," using reinforced concrete blocks to trim the arches of the tunnels, replacing the previous method of using pig iron. This greatly saves iron, reducing iron consumption by nine-tenths. Moreover, reinforced concrete is strong and waterproof.
    The names of the future subway stations have already been chosen, such as "Dnieper" and "Bolshevik Factory." The decoration of the stations will fully express the national art style of Ukraine, and some of Ukraine's most famous architects have participated in the design. By the first half of 1960, the people of Kiev will be able to use underground trams for transportation. (Jun)

### 基辅的地下铁道

    基辅的地下铁道
    凡是到莫斯科作客的人，总要参观一下地下铁道。以优美驰名世界的莫斯科地下铁道的车站，真像是一座座的地下宫殿。从浮雕一直到灯的形状，都出自艺术家的精心设计，而且每个车站的装饰都不一样，各有各的风格。那么，苏联其他城市是不是也有地下铁道呢？除列宁格勒市外，就要数刚刚开始建设这种交通工具的基辅了。这个乌克兰共和国的首都，将是苏联拥有地下铁道的第三个城市。
    在第聂伯河的高高的河岸上，已经可以看到一个巨大的地下隧道的入口。这是基辅地下铁道的第一条线路的起点。这条线路长九公里多。虽然从地面上看不出什么动静，但是在地下，工作却是不分昼夜地沸腾着。在建筑工作中，工人们采用了新的所谓“基辅的方法”，用钢筋混凝土块修整隧道的拱壁，代替了过去用生铁的办法。这就大大节约了铁，使铁的消耗缩减了十分之九。而且钢筋混凝土又坚固，又可以防水。
    未来的地下车站的名字已经起好了，如“第聂伯”、“布尔什维克工厂”等。车站的装饰将充分表现出乌克兰的民族艺术风格，一些乌克兰最著名的建筑师都参加了设计工作。到1960年的上半年，基辅人就可以用地下电车代步了。　（君）
