    On Various Posts in the Construction of the Motherland
    Female Train Attendant
    Over 300 female workers and train attendants of the Beijing Train Section have all made pledges to welcome "March 8th" (International Women's Day). The second crew of the Beijing-Shenyang line proposed an initiative to all crews of the section to strive to become an advanced group before April 1st, achieving "red in every trip" (the group with the best competitive results in planned trips receives a red flag). The other three female crews on the Beijing-Shenyang line surpassed the male crews in a sanitation competition within the section. The female attendants put forward the slogan: "Make the train a home for passengers, and the attendants loyal friends to passengers." Liu Shuzhen, a female train attendant on the fourth group from Beijing to Lanzhou, received fourteen letters of commendation from passengers on February 27th alone due to her proactive and patient service.

    Female Scientific Worker
    Zeng Mibai, an associate researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Sciences, is a woman in her thirties. Before liberation, she never had the opportunity to engage in scientific research. After liberation, she entered the Experimental Biology Institute of the Academy of Sciences, and under the Party's cultivation, she rose from an assistant researcher to an associate researcher. She said, "I have recognized the path that intellectuals should take and am determined to be a 'both red and expert' socialist scientific fighter." She accepted a challenge from a female comrade and set out a "both red and expert" plan. Now, in addition to her work during the day, she conducts research late into the night every day. (Shang Jie)
    Female Police Officer
    Recently, female traffic police officers appeared for the first time on the bustling streets of Wuhan City.
    The first batch of female traffic police consists of thirteen officers. They are female cadres from the Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau assigned to the Municipal Traffic Brigade. They are all young women, including six Communist Party members and six Communist Youth League members. After being assigned to the Traffic Brigade, they underwent more than twenty days of training and have basically mastered the professional knowledge required of traffic police. Their work locations are the busy Jianghan Road and Minsheng Road and other intersection areas. Serving as traffic police here requires a high degree of concentration, quick reflexes, flexible command, and ensuring no accidents occur. To meet this requirement, they demonstrated a spirit of hard work and study. (Gong Zhongxing)
    Female Singer
    Last night, some unfamiliar actors appeared on the stage of Xiaotaoyuan, a small theater often visited by working residents of Tianqiao. People watched a female singer with fresh eyes, listening to her sing a new song, "Mom, I Want to Go to the Countryside." Who is she?
    She, the young female singer of the Central Orchestra, Liu Shufang, has gained a good reputation abroad; now, her name is gradually spreading among a wider audience. To let workers, soldiers, and students hear songs that reflect the reality of struggle and life, and to encourage their production and learning, Liu Shufang actively asks composers for new songs. She practices diligently, hoping that her singing can produce more power.
    Art performance groups are all striving towards self-sufficiency, increasing the number of performances, expanding the audience, and better reaching the workers and peasants. Liu Shufang proposed a plan to perform at least two hundred and forty shows this year, earning three hundred and twenty work points, to compete with her colleagues. The Central Orchestra has moved out of the large, newly built Tianqiao Theater and is performing at the nearby Xiaotaoyuan. Liu Shufang and her colleagues are constantly advancing!

    Female Manager
    People living near Najizhen in Arong Banner, Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, always want to go to a middle-aged Korean female shop assistant when they go to the first outlet of Arong Banner Department Store to buy things, and choose what they want. Customers praise her: "The service attitude is good, and she thinks carefully for the buyers." This popular shop assistant is the newly appointed manager of this outlet—Kim Hyang-soon, a Korean female Communist Party member.
    Comrade Kim Hyang-soon was originally a rural woman. In August 1951, when Comrade Kim Hyang-soon first came out of her home to become a shop assistant, she became flustered when some villagers came to buy things. In addition, she could not speak Chinese, so when she met Han Chinese villagers, she had to use gestures. But this difficulty did not discourage her. She decided to study hard and work diligently. Whenever she had free time, she practiced speaking Chinese. Now, she can answer customers fluently in Chinese.
    In the past, only male comrades in the department store went to the countryside to sell goods. Later, she led the female comrades in the entire department store to actively do mobile sales work, going to various organizations, schools, and hotels in Najizhen and nearby agricultural cooperatives, especially during the rainy season. When people were unwilling to go out but urgently needed rain gear, they delivered galoshes, umbrellas, and raincoats to their doorsteps in the rain. (Hongye, Wenbin)
    Female Nursery Worker
    Ma Yinchun is an old woman in her fifties from Xiaguihua Township Agricultural Cooperative in Licheng County, Shanxi Province. She has no children of her own and likes children the most. Three years ago, the members of the cooperative elected her as a nanny, and they set up a kindergarten in the cooperative. The kindergarten enrolled thirty or forty children, and at that time, there was almost nothing besides herself.
    But what about now? The kindergarten has completely changed its appearance. The thirty-odd children have more than a hundred kinds of toys, and there are also "swings" and "slides." Where did these toys come from? Originally, their bamboo horses were made of sorghum stalks, their little birds, kittens, chickens, and puppies were made of mud, their dolls were made of scraps of cloth, their gongs and drums were made of broken washbasins and rotten pots, their balls were made of rotten cotton spun into thread, and their "swings" and "slides" were made of scrap wood.

    在建设祖国的各个岗位上
    女列车员
    北京列车段三百多名女职工、女列车员，都订了迎接“三八”的保证。京沈线第二包乘组向全段各组提出了倡议，在4月1日前争取作先进小组，作到“趟趟红”（小组乘务趟班计划竞赛最好的挂红牌）。京沈线另外三个妇女包乘组在全段比卫生竞赛中，超过了男同志的包乘组。女乘务员们提出了口号：“使列车成为旅客之家，乘务员成为旅客忠实的朋友”。由北京到兰州第四组女列车员刘淑珍，由于主动耐心为旅客服务，仅在2月27日的乘务工作中就收到旅客表扬信十四件。

    女科学工作者
    上海科学院副研究员曾弥白是一个三十多岁的妇女。解放前，她一直没有从事科学研究工作的机会。解放后，她进了科学院实验生物研究所，在党的培养下，由一个助理研究员升为副研究员。她说：“我认清了知识分子应走的道路，决心做一个‘又红又专’的社会主义科学战士。”她接受一个女同志的挑战，订出了“又红又专”的规划。现在，她除了白天工作以外，每天晚上都要进行研究直到深夜。（尚解） 
    女警察
    最近，武汉市繁华的街头上，第一次出现了实习的女交通警察。
    第一批女交通警共有十三名。她们是武汉市公安局下放到市交通大队的女干部。她们都是年轻的姑娘，其中有六个共产党员，六个共青团员。她们下放交通大队后，经过二十多天的学习，已基本上掌握了交通警应具备的业务知识。她们的工作地点是繁华的江汉路和民生路等岗台地段。在这里担任交通警，必须思想高度集中，眼明手快，灵活指挥，并保证不出任何事故。她们为了达到这个要求，发挥了艰苦的学习的精神。　（宫忠兴）
    女歌唱家
    昨晚，在天桥劳动居民常爱去的小剧场——小桃园的舞台上，出现了一些大家很陌生的演员。人们用新鲜的眼光注视着一位女歌唱家，聆听她唱的一首新歌“妈妈，我要下乡”。她是谁？
    她，中央乐团的青年女歌唱家刘淑芳的名字，在国外曾获得很好的声誉；如今，正逐渐在更广泛的群众中传开了。为了让工人、战士、学生听到反映现实斗争生活的歌曲，鼓舞他们的生产和学习情绪，刘淑芳积极地向作曲家要新歌，她认真地练习，盼望自己的歌声能够产生出更多的力量。
    艺术表演团体都在朝着自给自足的目标努力，他们要增加演出场数，扩大观众面，更好地深入到工农群众中去。刘淑芳提出了今年最少演出二百四十场，得到三百二十个工分，来和她的同伴们竞赛。中央乐团已经走出了规模宏大、新建的天桥剧场，来到它旁边的小桃园演出，刘淑芳和她的同伴们正不断在跃进！

    女经理
    住在内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟阿荣旗那吉镇附近的人们，要到阿荣旗百货公司第一门市部买东西时，总愿走到一位中年朝鲜族女售货员跟前，挑选他们所要的东西。顾客们称赞她：“服务态度好，替买主想的周到”。这位受欢迎的售货员，就是这个门市部的新任经理——朝鲜族女共产党员金香顺。
    金香顺同志原来是个农村妇女，1951年8月间，金香顺同志刚从家里出来当上售货员的时候，有几个老乡来买东西，她的脑子就乱了。再加上不会说汉话，遇到汉族老乡，只好用手来回比划做手势。但这个困难并没有使她气馁。她决心刻苦学习和努力钻研，一有空闲就练习说汉语，现在，她回答顾客已能用汉话对答如流。
    过去，门市部只有男同志下乡卖货，后来，她带动全门市部的女同志，主动去做流动出售工作，出入那吉镇的各机关、学校和旅店和附近的农业社，特别是雨季，当人们不愿出屋又迫切需要防雨用具时，他们就冒雨把胶鞋、雨伞、雨衣送上门去。　（鸿业、文彬）
    女保育员
    马银春是个山西黎城县下桂花乡农业社的一位五十多岁的老大妈，平生无子女，最是喜欢孩子，大前年，社员们选她当保姆，在社里办了一个幼儿园。幼儿园收托了三、四十个孩子，当时，除了她自己以外，几乎是什么也没有了。
    可是，现在呢？幼儿园已经完全改变了面貌，三十多个孩子有了一百多种玩具，并且还有“秋千”和“滑板”。这些玩具是哪里来的呢？原来，他们的竹马是高粱秆做的，他们的小鸟、小猫、鸡鸡、狗狗是泥巴做的，他们的娃娃是碎布做的，他们的锣鼓是破脸盆、烂锅做的，他们的皮球是烂棉花纺成线做的，他们的“秋千”和“滑板”是废木料做的。（附图片）
