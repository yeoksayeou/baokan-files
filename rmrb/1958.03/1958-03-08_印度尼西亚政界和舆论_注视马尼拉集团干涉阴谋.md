Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 7th: Indonesian public opinion and political figures are closely watching the Manila Treaty Organization meeting to be held soon in Manila.

Mansur, Chairman of the National Assembly's Defense Subcommittee of Indonesia, said in a statement that he hoped the Manila Treaty Organization would not interfere in Indonesian affairs. He said that such interference would destabilize the situation in Southeast Asia and the world.

Commenting on the statement by Manila Treaty Organization Secretary-General Pote Sarasin that the group would not supply weapons to the Hussein group, Mansur said that if the member states of the Manila Treaty Organization did not supply weapons to the rebels, this is exactly what the Indonesian people hoped for. But in any case, the Hussein rebel group has in fact obtained weapons from abroad.

"Dongxing Daily" revealed today that before the Manila Treaty Organization meeting was held, the Hussein rebel group had already sent its leading figures to Manila, preparing to contact the Nila Treaty Organization outside the conference hall at any time.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Military Advisory Conference began in Manila on the 6th. This meeting is a prelude to the council meeting of this aggressive military bloc scheduled to begin on the 11th.

The four-day military advisory conference will begin holding secret meetings on the 7th. It is revealed that the most important agenda of this meeting will be to discuss the issue of this aggressive organization strengthening its subversive activities in the Southeast Asian region. In this regard, according to Agence France-Presse, military advisors from some countries participating in the meeting privately admitted that the meeting will discuss the Indonesian issue.

    注视马尼拉集团干涉阴谋
    据新华社雅加达7日电　印度尼西亚舆论和政界人士正在密切注意即将在马尼拉召开的马尼拉条约组织会议。
    印度尼西亚国会国防小组委员会主席曼苏尔在发表谈话时，表示希望马尼拉条约组织不要干涉印度尼西亚的问题。他说，这种干涉会使东南亚和世界局势不稳定。
    在评论马尼拉条约组织秘书长乃朴·沙拉信所说的这个集团不会把武器供给侯赛尼集团的话时，曼苏尔说，如果马尼拉条约组织的成员国不把武器供给叛乱分子，这正是印度尼西亚人民所希望的。但是不管怎样，侯赛尼叛乱集团事实上从外国得到了武器。
    “东星报”今天揭露，在马尼拉条约组织会议召开以前，侯赛尼叛乱集团已经派遣它的首要人物到马尼拉去，准备随时在会议厅外同
  尼拉条约组织联系。
    据新华社讯　东南亚条约组织军事顾问会议6日在马尼拉开始举行。这次会议是这个侵略性军事集团预定在11日开始举行的理事会会议的前奏。
    这次为时四天的军事顾问会议将在7日开始举行秘密会议。据透露，这次会议的最重要的议程将是讨论这个侵略组织加强它在东南亚地区的颠覆活动问题。在这方面，据法新社报道，参加这次会议的一些国家的军事顾问在私下承认，这次会议将要讨论印度尼西亚问题。
