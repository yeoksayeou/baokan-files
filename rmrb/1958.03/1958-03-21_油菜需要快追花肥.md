Rapeseed in the southern regions, sown in winter, has generally entered the stages of budding, bolting, flowering, and gradual pod formation. During this stage, rapeseed plants urgently require a large supply of nutrients. Although the base fertilizer applied to rapeseed last winter was somewhat increased compared to previous years, the overall fertilization level is still not high. In some areas, although sufficient base fertilizer and multiple topdressings were applied, the nutrients remaining in the soil are no longer sufficient to meet the rapid growth needs of rapeseed in the later stages, due to continuous absorption and utilization by the plants and loss from rainwater erosion in winter and spring. Not long ago, temperatures dropped in some areas of the Yangtze River basin, and rapeseed in a few areas even suffered frost damage. Therefore, starting now, it is necessary to add a flowering-stage topdressing to the rapeseed fields at certain intervals.

Applying a topdressing once during the initial flowering stage of rapeseed has a very significant effect on increasing yield. Taking the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Wugang County, Hunan Province, as an example, the unit yield of rapeseed with flowering-stage topdressing was 30% higher than that without topdressing.

Many areas have already begun flowering-stage topdressing in conjunction with rapeseed frost prevention. There are still some areas and production units that have not yet taken action in this regard. The flowering period of rapeseed is short, and if there is any delay in this work, the opportunity to apply flowering-stage topdressing will be lost.

At present, some areas in the south have experienced heavy rainfall, and aphids have occurred in some areas of rapeseed. All rapeseed-producing areas should also combine topdressing and clearing drainage ditches to prevent and control pests, in order to create more favorable conditions for striving for a bumper rapeseed harvest this year.

    油菜需要快追花肥
    南方地区的冬播油菜已普遍进入现蕾、抽苔、开花和逐渐结菜阶段。在这个阶段里，油菜植株迫切需要大量养分供应。去年冬季各地油菜基肥虽然比往年有所增加，施肥水平仍然不高。有些地区虽然底肥较足、追肥较多，因为植株不断吸收利用和冬春季节雨水冲失，残留在土壤中的养分已不能满足油菜后期迅速生长的需要。不久以前，长江流域有些地区气温下降，少数地区的油菜并有受冻现象。因此，必须由现在起，在一定时间里对油菜田增加一次花期追肥。
    在油菜初花期增施一次追肥，增产效果十分显著。以湖南武冈县红星农业社为例，追施花肥的油菜比不追施的单位产量高30％。
    现在很多地区已结合油菜防冻开始了花期追肥。还有一些地区和一些生产单位，在这方面还没有行动。油菜花期较短，如果在这项工作上稍加拖延，追施花肥的时机就会失掉。
    目前南方一些地区已出现多雨情况，部分地区的油菜已发生蚜虫。各油菜产区还应当结合追肥、清沟排渍来防治虫害，为争取今年油菜丰收创造更有利的条件。
