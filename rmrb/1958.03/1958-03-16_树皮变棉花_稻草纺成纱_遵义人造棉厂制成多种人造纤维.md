    Tree Bark Transformed into Cotton, Straw Spun into Yarn
    Zunyi Artificial Cotton Factory Produces Various Artificial Fibers

    (By Our Newspaper) Guizhou Daily News: The newly built Zunyi Artificial Cotton Factory in Guizhou Province, using manual operation in early March, successfully trial-produced artificial cotton from eighteen kinds of fiber-containing plants and spun it into yarn and wove it into cloth. After testing by the Southwest Textile Administration Bureau, the quality of this artificial cotton was deemed qualified.

    Due to natural conditions, the Zunyi Prefecture only produces 20%-30% of the cotton needed by the entire area annually. In order to solve the major problem of clothing the people, the Zunyi Prefecture, in the upsurge of vigorously developing local industry, adhering to the principle of "develop what is needed, develop what is possible," simply borrowed a room in mid-January to establish this factory. The main equipment consisted of only one cotton gin, two pots, and a few buckets. The technical staff and workers of this factory used manual operation to trial-produce artificial cotton from rice straw, ramie, cotton stalk bark, banana tree trunks, castor bean skin, willow bark, oleander bark, paper mulberry bark, etc. Now, eighteen kinds of raw materials have been completely successfully trial-produced into artificial cotton. From the experimental results, the general recovery rate is above 33%. Among them, ramie has the highest recovery rate, with 60 kilograms of cotton produced from every 100 kilograms of ramie; the recovery rate of rice straw is also 30%; the lowest is paper mulberry bark, with a recovery rate of 10%. The quality of these artificial cottons is very good, with fibers as long as 1.2 to 1.5 inches; while the cotton fiber in the Zunyi Prefecture is only 9 millimeters. The cost of artificial cotton is also relatively low. According to current trial results, it is about one-fifth lower than the average price of lint cotton.

    The manufacturing method of artificial cotton is very simple. Taking rice straw as an example: soak the rice straw in cold water for one day, then boil it with 15% alkaline water for four hours, wash it clean with water, then soak it in a mixed solution of 10% sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid for eight hours, wash it clean with water, add a Turkish mixed solution and soak it for one and a half days to soften the fibers, then bleach it with bleaching powder and sodium bicarbonate to brighten it, and after drying, it can be ginned into cotton.

    Now, the Zunyi Artificial Cotton Factory plans to produce 500 tons of artificial cotton annually. This amount is equivalent to the yield of 10,000 mu of cotton fields. The Zunyi Prefecture is preparing to fully promote this experience.

    This is the artificial cotton made from rice straw and other plants by the Zunyi Artificial Cotton Factory.

### 树皮变棉花　稻草纺成纱  遵义人造棉厂制成多种人造纤维

    树皮变棉花　稻草纺成纱
    遵义人造棉厂制成多种人造纤维
    本报讯　贵州日报消息：贵州省新建遵义人造棉厂，3月初用手工操作，分别把十八种含有纤维的植物，试制成功了人造棉，并且纺成了线，织成了布。经过西南纺织管理局鉴定，这种人造棉质量合格。
    由于自然条件的限制，遵义专区一年生产的棉花只够全区需要量的20％—30％。为了解决人民穿衣的重大问题，遵义专区在大力发展地方工业的浪潮中，本着“需要甚么就发展甚么，可能发展甚么就发展甚么”的原则，在1月中因陋就简地借一间房建立了这个工厂。主要设备只有一架弹花机、两口锅和几个桶。这个厂的技术人员和工人，用手工操作，用稻草、青麻、棉秆皮、芭蕉树干、蓖麻皮、杨柳皮、夹竹桃皮、构皮壳等，试制人造棉。现在，十八种原材料完全试制成功了人造棉。从试验结果来看，一般回收率都在33％以上。其中青麻的回收率最高，每百公斤青麻可出棉六十公斤；稻草的回收率也达30％；最低的是构皮壳，回收率是10％。这些人造棉的质量都很好，纤维长达一寸二至一寸五；而遵义专区的棉花纤维只有九公厘。人造棉的成本也较低，按现在试制结果计算，比皮棉价格平均约低五分之一。
    人造棉的制造方法很简单。以稻草作原料为例：把稻草用冷水浸一天以后，用15％的碱水蒸煮四小时，再用水洗净，然后用10％的硫酸和盐酸混合液浸八小时，用水洗净后，加土耳其混合溶液浸一天半，使纤维软化，再用漂白粉和重碳酸钠漂白出光，干燥以后，就可弹成棉花。
    现在，遵义人造棉厂计划年产人造棉五百吨。这个数量相当于一万亩棉田的产量。遵义专区正准备全面推广这个经验。
