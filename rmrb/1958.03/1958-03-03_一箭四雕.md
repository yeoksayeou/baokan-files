Editor's Note:

    Killing Four Birds with One Arrow

    The campaign against waste and against conservatism is in full swing. However, some comrades in political and legal affairs and personnel departments believe that these organs are "clean water departments" and that there is not much "oil and water" to be squeezed out in the fight against waste.

    Of course, the amount of waste in political departments is not as large numerically as in economic departments, but it cannot be said that it is not serious. What is particularly serious is that these "clean water departments" have a considerable "official" air of detachment from the masses. It can be seen that the water in these organs is neither clean nor is the atmosphere correct. It is not that there is no "oil and water" to be opposed, but that it is worth seriously opposing.

    Comrades who say "not much oil and water" and "clean water departments" have reduced the great significance of this struggle to merely opposing economic waste. Why haven't they seen the large amount of conservative thinking and bureaucratic inertia existing in their own units? Why haven't they felt that their own units also need to boost their energy to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, and catch up with the advanced?

    Don't forget: the campaign against waste and against conservatism must kill four birds with one arrow. Economically, it must achieve great savings; ideologically, it must achieve great improvement; in work style, it must achieve great improvement; and in methods, it must achieve great change. If we oppose it in this way, there will be a lot of "oil and water."

    一箭四雕
    反浪费反保守热火朝天，偏偏有一部分政法、人事部门的同志认为这些机关是“清水衙门”，反浪费油水不大。
    当然，政治部门浪费的数目字没有经济部门那样大，但绝不能说不严重。尤其严重的是，这些“清水衙门”脱离群众的“衙门”气却着实不小，可见这些机关里的水既不清，风也不正，不是没有什么油水可反，而是值得认真地反一反。
    说“油水不大”、“清水衙门”的同志，把这一斗争的巨大意义缩小到仅是反对经济上的浪费。为什么没有看到自己单位里大量存在的保守思想和官气暮气呢？为什么没有感到自己的单位也需要鼓起干劲来比先进学先进赶先进呢？
    不要忘记：反浪费反保守运动，要一箭射四雕，在经济上要大节省，在思想上要大提高，在作风上要大改进，在方法上要大改变。这样来反，油水就很大。
