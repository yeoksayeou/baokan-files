    The United States Faces a New Test
    By People's Daily Commentator

    The Soviet government announced a new proposal for maintaining peace on the 15th. This proposal contains the following three aspects: First, to prohibit the use of outer space for military purposes; second, to remove foreign military bases from the territories of all countries, primarily foreign military bases on the territories of European, Middle Eastern, and North African countries; third, the United Nations should establish an international cooperation agency to study outer space and engage in the research of outer space.

    The Soviet proposal can eliminate the threat of using outer space for war purposes and using foreign military bases for aggression, and opens up broad prospects for mankind to complete the great cause of conquering outer space with the collective wisdom of international cooperation.

    Prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes primarily concerns the issue of intercontinental ballistic rockets with nuclear warheads. In the current world, only the Soviet Union possesses usable intercontinental ballistic rockets. This weapon in the hands of the peace-loving Soviet Union has completely bankrupted the so-called "policy of strength" of Western countries, especially the United States. Therefore, in order to obstruct the convening of a summit conference, the United States has repeatedly raised the issue that outer space should be used forever for peaceful purposes.

    Judging the Soviet Union's intentions by its own, the United States was convinced that the Soviet Union could not abandon this military advantage and would not accept this proposal. In this way, the United States could use this to greatly publicize that the Soviet Union has no sincerity for peace and shift the responsibility for obstructing the summit conference to the Soviet side. However, the United States has once again outsmarted itself!

    Everyone knows that the Soviet Union has always been committed to easing international tensions. In order to promote the convening of a summit conference, it is willing to promote the realization of any proposal that is conducive to peace. The Soviet Union's new proposal once again shows that the Soviet Union is willing, under the condition that international peace is guaranteed to a certain extent, to undertake the obligation to prohibit the use of intercontinental ballistic rockets for military purposes. That is to say, in order to seek peaceful coexistence, the Soviet Union can consider prohibiting the use of intercontinental missiles, in which the United States lags far behind. This powerfully shows that the Soviet Union has no intention of threatening the United States in the slightest.

    But everyone knows that in order to actively prepare for war, the United States has set up more than 200 military bases in other countries' territories around the world (according to the "New York Times" on February 9 this year, the United States has 274 military bases in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia). It recently signed an agreement with the United Kingdom to set up four intermediate-range missile bases in the United Kingdom, and is also preparing to set up such bases in other Western European countries. The spearhead of these bases is directly pointed at the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union, while agreeing to consider prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes, proposed simultaneously removing foreign bases from the territories of all countries. This is not only eliminating the threat of war from outer space but also from the earth. This is completely reasonable and a positive proposal that benefits the people of the world.

    Now, the Soviet proposal has been placed before the United States. The leaders of the United States have repeatedly stated in the past that they hope outer space will be used for peaceful purposes and not for war purposes; US Secretary of State Dulles recently also said that if it can be guaranteed that outer space will never be used for purposes other than peaceful ones, it is worth holding a summit conference. If these remarks are sincere, then they have no reason not to accept the Soviet proposal, and even less reason to continue delaying the summit conference.

    Since the Soviet Union's first red moon went into space, mankind has entered the era of outer space. However, mankind's knowledge of outer space is still extremely limited, and in the cause of exploring the secrets of outer space and peacefully using outer space for the benefit of mankind, people still have endless work to do. The realization of the Soviet proposal can greatly promote this magnificent cause through international cooperation.

    The people of the whole world are now watching to see how the leaders of the United States will treat the Soviet Union's new proposal.

    美国面临新的考验
    本报评论员
    苏联政府15日公布了一项维护和平的新建议。这个建议包含了以下三方面的内容：一、禁止利用宇宙空间达到军事目的；二、撤除各国领土上的外国军事基地，首先是欧洲、中近东和北非国家领土上的外国军事基地；三、联合国成立一个研究宇宙空间的国际合作机构，从事宇宙空间的研究工作。
    苏联的这个建议，可以消除利用宇宙空间作战争用途和利用国外军事基地进行侵略的威胁，并为人类以国际合作的集体智慧来完成征服宇宙空间的伟大事业打开了广阔的前景。
    禁止利用宇宙空间达到军事目的，这首先就是禁止带有核弹头的洲际弹道火箭的问题。在目前的世界上，只有苏联拥有可以使用的洲际弹道火箭。这种武器掌握在爱好和平的苏联手中，使得西方国家，特别是美国的所谓“实力政策”彻底破产了。于是，为了阻挠最高级会议的召开，美国一再提出了这个宇宙空间应当永远用于和平目的的问题。
    以美国之心，度苏联之意，它满以为苏联是不能放弃这一军事优势的，因而不会接受这一建议。这样，美国就可以借此大大宣传苏联没有和平诚意，并把阻挠最高级会议的责任推到苏联方面去。可是，美国又一次弄巧成拙了！
    谁都知道，苏联是一直在致力于缓和国际紧张局势的。为了促成最高级会议的召开，任何有利于和平的建议，都愿促其实现。苏联的新建议，又一次表明了苏联愿意在国际和平获得一定保障的条件下，承担禁止为军事目的使用洲际弹道火箭的义务。也就是说，为了谋求和平共处，苏联可以考虑禁止使用美国远远落在后面的洲际导弹。这就有力地表明了苏联丝毫没有威胁美国的打算。
    可是谁都知道，美国为了积极准备战争，在世界各处的其他国家的领土上设置了二百多处军事基地（据今年2月9日“纽约时报”透露，美国在欧洲、中东、非洲和亚洲军事基地有二百七十四处），最近又同英国签订了在英国设置四处中程导弹基地的协定，并且还准备在西欧其他国家设置这种基地。这些基地的矛头都是直接指向着苏联和其他社会主义国家。在这种情况下，苏联在同意考虑禁止利用宇宙空间达到军事目的的同时，提出同时撤除各国领土上的外国基地，这就是不但从宇宙空间，并且从地球上消除战争的威胁，这是完全合情合理的，并且是为全世界人民造福的积极性建议。
    现在，苏联的建议已经摆在美国的面前了。美国的领导人过去曾一再表示，希望宇宙空间用于和平目的而不用于战争用途；美国国务卿杜勒斯最近还说到，如果能保证宇宙空间永远不会用于和平以外的目的，是值得举行一次最高级会议的。他们的这些谈论，如果是真诚的，那么，他们就没有理由不接受苏联的建议，也更没有理由来继续拖延最高级会议了。
    自从苏联的第一个红月亮上天之后，人类已经进入了宇宙空间的时代。但是，人类对于宇宙空间的知识还是极其有限，在探索宇宙空间的秘密和为了人类的福利而和平利用宇宙空间的事业上，人们还有着无穷的工作可做。实现苏联的建议，就能通过国际合作大大促进这个宏伟的事业。
    全世界人民现在都注视着，美国领导人究竟将怎样对待苏联的新建议。
