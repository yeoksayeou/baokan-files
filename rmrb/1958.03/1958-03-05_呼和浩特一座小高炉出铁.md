    A Small Blast Furnace in Hohhot Produces Iron
    The newly built small blast furnace of the local state-owned Hohhot Xinsheng Iron Factory produced its first furnace of iron on the 3rd.
    It can produce 6.25 tons of iron per day; this year's plan is to produce 2,000 tons.
    The commissioning of this small blast furnace is of great significance for solving the problem of agricultural water conservancy and agricultural mechanization in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    This small blast furnace was built based on the principles of being simple and crude, requiring little investment, and producing a lot of iron. The factory buildings are temporary earth and wood structures built by the factory workers themselves.

    呼和浩特一座小高炉出铁
    地方国营呼和浩特新生铁工厂新建小高炉3日生产出第一炉铁。
    它每天能产生铁六点二五吨；今年计划生产两千吨。
    这座小高炉投入生产对解决内蒙古自治区的农业水利化和农业机械化有重要意义。
    这座小高炉是本着因陋就简、投资少、出铁多的原则兴建的。厂房都是厂里工人自己修建的临时性的土木建筑。
