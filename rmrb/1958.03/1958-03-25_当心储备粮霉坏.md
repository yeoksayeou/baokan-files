Beware of Mold in Reserve Grain
Tian Lianqian
    Since the state put forward the call to "use abundance to compensate for famine and store grain for preparedness," many agricultural cooperatives have begun grain storage and famine preparedness work, and have made significant achievements. According to incomplete statistics from Guizhou Province, the cooperative's reserve grain has reached 200 million jin. There are 20,000 cooperatives with reserve grain in Hunan Province, with a total grain reserve of over 140 million jin. According to statistics from 4,927 cooperatives in Tangshan and Tongxian Special Districts, Hebei, those with reserve grain account for 28% of the total number of cooperatives.
    Farmers having reserve grain is something that has never happened in our country's history. Precisely because this is a new thing, some agricultural cooperatives have had problems in this regard, with the reserve grain becoming moldy and spoiled. This has occurred in provinces such as Hebei, Guangdong, and Hunan. This is a major issue that deserves attention.
    Since storing grain for preparedness is a new task, leading the masses in carrying it out requires even more effort. Some areas of Guizhou Province have taken the lead in this regard. Counties such as Tianzhu, Panxian, Sansui, and Jinsha, as early as last autumn, trained grain custodians for each agricultural cooperative with reserve grain, on a district-by-district basis, to strengthen the management of reserve grain. The grain departments in various parts of Hunan have also begun grain storage inspections. The Xiangxiang County Grain Bureau in this province adopted methods such as inspection and technology transfer to provide specific assistance to cooperatives with reserve grain. Now, the season when grain is prone to heating and mold has arrived. Some areas that have not yet paid attention to the safety of agricultural cooperatives' reserve grain need to quickly take up this work.
    The reserve grain of agricultural cooperatives is an important wealth created by the hard work of all members. In the event of a famine year, reserve grain is even more the lifeline of everyone. If something goes wrong in this regard, it will not only directly damage the interests of the masses, but also dampen their enthusiasm for storing grain. According to the provisions of the National Agricultural Development Program, each agricultural cooperative must achieve the task of storing grain for preparedness within the next ten years at the latest. Many agricultural cooperatives are also preparing to collect reserve grain in accordance with regulations in the near future; if the enthusiasm of the masses in this regard is dampened, how can this task be achieved ahead of schedule?

    当心储备粮霉坏
    田连阡
    自从国家提出“以丰补歉，积谷备荒”的号召以后，不少农业社开始了储粮备荒工作，并且有了显著的成绩。据贵州省不完全统计，合作社的储备粮已达两亿斤。湖南省有两万个有储备粮的社，储粮总数有一亿四千多万斤。河北唐山、通县两个专区四千九百二十七个社统计，有储备粮的占总社数28％。
    农民群众有储备粮，这在我国历史上是从没有过的事情。正因为这是一件新事情，所以有些农业社在这方面出了问题，霉坏了储备的粮食。河北、广东、湖南等省都有这种情况发生。这是一个值得注意的大问题。
    储粮备荒既是一件新的工作，领导群众进行的时候就更需要多花力气。贵州省的一些地区，在这方面已经先行了一步。天柱、盘县、三穗、金沙等县，早在去年秋后就以区为单位，为各有储备粮的农业社训练了粮食保管员，加强了储备粮的保管工作。湖南各地的粮食部门也开始了储粮检查。这个省湘乡县粮食局采取了检查、传授技术等方法，对有储粮的社进行了具体帮助。现在，粮食容易发热生霉的季节已经到了。一些还没有注意到农业社储备粮安全问题的地区，需要赶紧把这项工作抓起来。
    农业社的储备粮，是全体社员辛勤劳动创造出来的一笔重要财富。遇到荒年，储备粮更是大家的命根子。如果在这方面出了差错，不但直接损害了群众的利益，而且会使群众储粮的积极性受到挫伤。根据农业发展纲要的规定，各农业社最迟要在今后十年里实现储粮备荒的任务。许多农业社并且准备在最近几年按规定把储备粮收集起来；如果挫伤了群众在这方面的积极性，怎么能提前实现这一任务呢？
