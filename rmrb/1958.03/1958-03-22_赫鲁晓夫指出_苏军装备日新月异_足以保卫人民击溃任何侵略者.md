Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 21st: TASS reports from Moscow: Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said on March 20th that the Soviet Union now has a highly developed industry, and technological innovations are constantly being carried out in various production sectors. On this basis, the armaments and all technical equipment of the Soviet armed forces have been undergoing profound changes.

He pointed out that the role of manned winged aircraft is now slightly reduced, and it is being replaced by rocket aircraft and rocket technology.

He also said that the Soviet armed forces now possess very powerful weapons. If any aggressor attempts to invade the Soviet Union, our armed forces have all the necessary conditions to defend the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and defeat any aggressor.

Khrushchev made these remarks to the graduates of the Soviet Army Aviation Engineering Academy. The CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers held a reception for them in the Grand Kremlin Palace.

Khrushchev also pointed out that the main goal of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government is not war, but peace. He said that we advocate taking the principle of peaceful coexistence as the basis of international relations, taking into account the interests of each country in resolving all international issues, and not using force in resolving any disputes between countries. We still believe that the leaders of Western countries will one day come to their senses, because the people of the world are increasingly determined to end the "Cold War" and stop the arms race.

In his speech, Khrushchev also talked about the recently held elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He said that this election once again demonstrated the unbreakable unity between the Communist Party and the Soviet people, and the Soviet people once again expressed their support for and endorsement of the domestic and foreign policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

At the reception, Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Marshal Malinovsky, Minister of Defense, and Air Marshal Vershinin, as well as representatives of graduates and teachers of the Aviation Engineering Academy, also spoke.

    赫鲁晓夫指出
    苏军装备日新月异
    足以保卫人民击溃任何侵略者
    据新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫20日说，苏联现在有高度发展的工业，各生产部门不断进行着技术革新。在这个基础上，苏联武装部队的军备和一切技术装备一直在发生着深刻的变化。
    他指出，靠人驾驶的有翼飞机的作用现在稍微降低了，代替它的是火箭飞机和火箭技术。
    他又说，苏联的武装部队现在拥有威力很大的武器，如果任何侵略者企图侵犯苏联，我们的武装部队有一切必要的条件来保卫苏联人民的和平劳动，击溃任何侵略者。
    赫鲁晓夫是对苏联军队航空工程学院毕业生讲这番话的。苏共中央和苏联部长会议在大克里姆林宫为他们举行了招待会。
    赫鲁晓夫还指出，苏联共产党和苏联政府的主要目标不是战争，而是和平。他说，我们主张把和平共处的原则作为国际关系的基础，在解决一切国际问题时考虑到每个国家的利益，在解决国与国之间的任何争端时都不使用武力。我们仍旧相信西方国家领导人终有一天会理智起来，因为全世界人民越来越坚决地要求终止“冷战”，停止军备竞赛。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中还谈到刚刚举行的苏联最高苏维埃的选举。他说，这次选举再一次表明了共产党和苏联人民的牢不可破的团结，苏联人民再一次表示拥护和支持苏联共产党的内政和外交政策。
    在这次招待会上，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫、国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅和空军元帅维尔希宁，以及航空工程学院的毕业生代表和教师代表也讲了话。
