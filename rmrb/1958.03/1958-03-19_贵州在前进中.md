Guizhou Advances

Whenever Guizhou Province is mentioned, people think of the old saying that prevailed before liberation: "No three days of sunshine, no three miles of flat land, and no three cents of silver." They think that Guizhou is still a very barren place. Wrong, since liberation, the face of Guizhou has undergone great changes.

The proportion of the total industrial output value of Guizhou Province in the total industrial and agricultural output value has increased from 1.64% before liberation to 10.2% by the end of 1957. The number of various factories and mines has increased from twenty-six at the time of liberation to more than seven hundred and ninety.

Agricultural production has also developed greatly since liberation. Taking 1936, the year with the highest grain output before liberation, as the standard, the average grain production per person was only 429 jin (approximately 215kg). From 1949 to 1957, it increased to 646 jin (approximately 323kg). The irrigated area in 1949 was 2,847,091 mu (approximately 189,806 hectares), and it increased to 7,930,000 mu (approximately 528,667 hectares) in 1957. As of the beginning of March this year, it has increased by another 8,129,000 mu (approximately 541,933 hectares).

The total output value of handicrafts has also increased from more than 140 million yuan before liberation to more than 220 million yuan.

Guizhou is also rich in native products. In some areas, native products account for more than 70% of farmers' total income. Important native products include tung oil, wood oil, honey, raw lacquer, shiitake mushrooms, and white fungus. The large amount of cork oak bark produced does not transmit sound, heat, or fire, and it is an important construction raw material, with the best quality in the country. Camphor, Phoebe zhennan, ginkgo, and walnut wood, which have great economic value, are produced in the province.

Guizhou's underground resources are also very rich and have great development prospects. Coal is found in almost every county. Some counties have large reserves. For example, a large coalfield near Shuicheng County is estimated to have reserves of 300 to 400 million tons. Guizhou Province's mercury reserves rank first in the country and are world-renowned. They have been discovered in more than ten counties, including Tongchuan. The manganese iron in the Zunyi area has large reserves and good quality, which can be used by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company to smelt various types of steel. Geologists have discovered that the manganese ore here is almost inexhaustible. Through general surveys and mass reporting of mineral deposits, zinc mines have been discovered in more than twenty counties in Guizhou Province. Soviet experts believe that the aluminum ore discovered in Guizhou Province is so good that the aluminum content is very high. Antimony ore is distributed in Qinglong and other counties.

In addition, many counties in Guizhou Province have copper, phosphate, coal, and petroleum mines. Of particular note is that the province contains rare metals. Therefore, Guizhou is known as a "multi-metal province."

Guizhou is a multi-ethnic province, with the Han ethnic group accounting for three-quarters of the province's population. In addition, there are ethnic minorities such as Miao, Buyi, Dong, Yi, Shui, Hui, Zhuang, and Yao, with a population of nearly four million, accounting for about a quarter of Guizhou's total population. There are four special districts, two autonomous prefectures, and seventy-nine counties in the province. The province has a land area of 174,000 square kilometers and a population of more than 15 million.

    贵州在前进中
    一提起贵州省，人们就会想到解放前流行的说法：“天无三日晴，地无三里平，人无三分银”，以为贵州还是一个非常贫瘠的地方。错了，解放以来，贵州的面貌已经发生了很大变化。
    贵州省工业总产值在工农业总产值中的比重，已由解放前1.64％提高到1957年底的10.2％。各种厂矿已由解放时的二十六个增加到七百九十多个。
    农业生产解放以来也有巨大发展。粮食产量，以解放前最高年产量的1936年算，每人平均只有粮食四百二十九斤，1949到1957年就增加到六百四十六斤。1949年的灌溉面积为二百八十四万七千零九十一亩，1957年增加到七百九十三万亩，到今年3月初为止，又增加八百一十二万九千亩。
    手工业总产值也从解放前一亿四千多万元增加到二亿二千多万元。
    贵州的土产品也很丰富，某些地区土产品占农民总收入的70％以上，重要的土产有桐油、木油、蜂蜜、生漆、香菇、银耳等。大量出产的栓皮栎树皮，不传音，不传热，不透火，是一种重要的建设原料，质量为全国第一。经济价值很大的香樟、楠木、白果木、核桃木在省内都有出产。
    贵州的地下蕴藏也十分丰富，大有开发前途。煤差不多每个县都有蕴藏。有的县蕴藏量很大，例如水城县附近的一个大煤田，估计蕴藏量就有三到四亿吨。贵州省汞（水银）的蕴藏量全国第一、世界知名，在铜川等十余县都有发现。遵义地区的锰铁，蕴藏量大，质量也好，可供鞍山钢铁公司冶炼各种不同的钢材。地质工作者发现，这里的锰矿几乎是取之不尽的。通过普查和群众报矿工作，在贵州省二十余县发现锌矿。在贵州省发现的铝矿，苏联专家认为这些矿石太好了，铝的含量很高。锑矿分布在晴隆等县。
    此外，贵州省的好些县份有铜矿、磷矿、煤矿和石油矿。特别值得注意的是这个省份蕴藏有稀有金属。所以贵州有“多金属省份”之称。
    贵州是个多民族的省份，汉族占全省人口四分之三，此外还有苗、布依、侗、彝、水家、回、僮、瑶等少数民族，人口约近四百万，占贵州总人口四分之一左右。全省共四个专区两个自治州七十九个县。全省土地面积十七万四千平方公里，人口一千五百多万。
