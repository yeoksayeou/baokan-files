　　This newspaper special dispatch by Xinhua News Agency: Under the leadership of Professor Yang Huian, the teachers of the Vegetable Cultivation Teaching and Research Group of Huazhong Agricultural College have earnestly implemented the teaching policy of integrating theory with practice. They have delved into agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs to learn and summarize the production experiences of farmers, which has played an important role in reforming teaching methods, enriching teaching content, and cultivating scientific personnel who possess both agricultural scientific knowledge and practical labor skills.

　　Several years ago, this teaching and research group encountered great difficulties in teaching. They lacked practical production experience and merely recited textbooks verbatim, resulting in very poor teaching results. At this time, Yang Huian, the head of the teaching and research group, had already begun to go deep into the countryside to learn from farmers. He summarized many rich production experiences of farmers and incorporated them into the teaching content, which was welcomed by the students and had a great influence on the other teachers in the teaching and research group.

　　From 1953, they established contacts with farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan. In order to master practical production techniques, they also participated directly in the production guidance work of the Huazhong Agricultural College farm, in conjunction with their own majors. In the process of practice, they not only mastered production techniques but also improved their theoretical level. The teachers promptly supplemented the summarized production experience and the results of scientific experiments conducted around key production issues into the teaching materials, and collected many specific examples for lectures, which had a very good effect. When assigning course papers and assignments, the teachers also closely integrated them with production practice. Through field observation and practical operation, students carefully analyzed and studied practical production problems. They were not only able to write better quality papers but also master cultivation techniques. Student Li Shunwang wrote a valuable paper entitled "Research on Cucumber Seedling Hardening" through cucumber sowing, seedling cultivation, and field management work. The cucumbers he cultivated matured twelve days earlier than the early-maturing cucumbers cultivated by the farm. Many teachers have also improved their scientific and theoretical level through practice. Mr. Zhang Yuezao was therefore promoted to lecturer and became one of the teachers with a higher level of professional competence in the department.

    华中农学院蔬菜栽培教研组
    革新教学的正确方法
    理论联系实际，虚心向群众学习
    本报特约新华社讯　华中农学院蔬菜栽培教研组的教师们在杨惠安教授的带动下，认真贯彻理论联系实际的教学方针，深入郊区农业社，学习和总结了农民的生产经验，对改革教学方法，丰富教学内容，对培养既有农业科学知识又能实际劳动的科学人材起了重要作用。
    几年以前，这个教研组曾在教学上碰到很大困难，他们缺乏实际生产经验，只是生搬硬套地念课本，教学效果很不好。这时，教研组长杨惠安教授已经开始深入农村向农民学习，总结了农民的许多丰富的生产经验，充实到教学内容中去，受到了学生的欢迎，对教研组的其它教师起了很大的影响。
    从1953年开始，他们与武汉市郊区农民建立了联系；为了掌握实际生产技术，他们还结合着本人的专业，直接参加了华中农学院农场的生产指导工作。他们在实践过程中，既掌握了生产技术，也提高了理论水平。教师们把总结的生产经验和围绕生产关键问题进行的科学试验成果，及时地补充到教材里去，并搜集了许多具体的实例来进行讲授，效果很好。教师们在布置课程论文和作业时，也紧密结合生产实践进行，学生通过田间观察和实际操作，认真分析研究生产实际问题，不仅能写出质量较好的论文，而且能掌握栽培技术。学生李顺旺通过黄瓜播种、养苗和田间管理工作，写出了“黄瓜幼苗锻炼的研究”的一篇有价值的论文，他培育的黄瓜比农场栽培的早熟黄瓜还提早了十二天成熟。许多教师通过实践，也提高了科学理论水平。张月藻先生因此被提升为讲师，成为系里业务水平较高的教师之一。
