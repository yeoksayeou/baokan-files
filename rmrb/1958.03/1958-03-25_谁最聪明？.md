    Who is the Cleverest?
    A father had three sons, all of whom did well in their studies. He wanted to find out which of them was the cleverest, so he held the following test.
    He took five hats, and in front of the children, he put red stars on three of them and white stars on two. Then he blindfolded the children and put a hat on each of their heads, and took the remaining two hats away. Afterward, he removed the blindfolds and asked them what color the star on their hat was, red or white?
    After thinking for a while, one child said the color of the star on his hat and explained the reason for his answer very correctly.
    Now, readers, what color is the star on this child's hat, how did he know, and what color are the stars on the other two children's hats? (Pang Jiayu)

    谁最聪明？
    一位父亲有三个儿子，他们的学习成绩全都很好。他想了解一下其中谁是最聪明的，于是举行了以下的测验。
    他拿来五顶帽子，当着孩子们的面把其中三顶钉上红星，两顶钉上白星。然后他蒙住孩子们的眼睛，在他们每人头上戴了一顶帽子，而把其余的两顶帽子拿开。以后就把蒙眼布去掉，并且问他们帽子上的星是什么颜色，红的呢还是白的呢？
    考虑了一会儿以后，一个孩子说出了他帽子上的星的颜色，并且很正确地解释了回答的理由。
    现在问读者：这个孩子帽上的星是什么颜色，他怎么知道的，另外两个孩子帽上的星又是什么颜色呢？　（庞加裕）
