It is Time to Stop the Bloody Atrocities of France
    ——Interview with Adeff Daniel, Representative of the Arab People's Congress
    By our reporter

    "We are facing a human tragedy. French colonialists, with the aid of the United States and the support of most member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, are carrying out genocidal massacres in Algeria. The number of deaths in this massacre has reached 600,000 – about one-twentieth of the total Algerian population. Now is the time for the Asian and African people to strengthen their actions to stop this bloody atrocity of France." Mr. Adeff Daniel, representative of the Arab People's Congress, excitedly told the reporter.
    Mr. Daniel came to our country to participate in the "Day of Solidarity with Algeria" activities. When the reporter interviewed him, the conversation naturally started with the Sakiet Sidi Youssef incident. Because this happened after the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference passed a resolution on the Algerian issue, and it was a major event closely related to the situation in Algeria. Mr. Daniel said indignantly: "From the French's inhuman bombing of peaceful residents in Tunisia, one can see what France is doing in Algeria. For more than three years, countless tragedies like the Sakiet Sidi Youssef incident have occurred in Algeria."
      "Why can't the bloodshed in Algeria end?" After Mr. Daniel raised this question, he immediately answered it himself: "The obstacle is that the French government has been unwilling to adopt a realistic attitude. In fact, more than three years of war have proved that military suppression cannot solve the problem; for France, recognizing Algeria's independence is the only sensible approach."
    The reporter told him that not long ago, French Foreign Minister Pineau reiterated the colonialist clichés, saying that Algeria has one million European residents, so it is a province of France and should not be granted independence.
    Mr. Daniel said in a satirical tone: "There are three million Italian residents in California, USA. Can Italy say that it is a province of Italy?" He then pointed out: "Not all of the one million European residents in Algeria are French nationals; a considerable number of them are originally from Italy or Spain; moreover, many European residents do not agree with France's colonial policies. The French government uses this as an excuse, but its purpose is only to cover up the essence of launching a 'dirty war' for the benefit of a handful of colonialists."
    Mr. Daniel started from the Western Mediterranean Alliance proposed by Guy Mollet and talked about the US attitude towards the Algerian issue. He said: "The situation of the UN General Assembly's several discussions on the Algerian issue shows that the United States supports France's colonialist policies. Moreover, France has also received financial and military assistance from the United States in the war. This practice of the United States not only causes greater sacrifices and losses to the Algerian people, but also constitutes a threat to world peace." After a short pause, he returned to express his views on the Western Mediterranean Alliance: "The purpose of forming this group is to Westernize the entire North Africa. However, the future political direction of Algeria can never be decided by the likes of Guy Mollet or Dulles. The Algerian National Liberation Front has issued a statement against the Western Mediterranean Pact plan, which clearly shows the will of the Algerian people."
    As the conversation was about to end, the representative of the Arab People's Congress said decisively: "The Arab people regard the struggle of their Algerian brothers as their own struggle. The Arab people firmly believe that the Algerian people will win national independence and the right to self-determination." He asked the Chinese people to give more support to the Algerian people.
    Yes, the 600 million people of China have always been deeply concerned about the Algerian people in struggle. Just as Guo Moruo, the head of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, said at the conference: "The struggle of friends is our struggle!" In this "Day of Solidarity with Algeria" activity, Mr. Daniel will deeply see this point.

    是制止法国血腥暴行的时候了
    ——访阿拉伯人民大会代表阿德夫·达尼尔
    本报记者
    “我们面临着一场人类的悲剧。法国殖民主义者在美国的援助和北大西洋集团大部分成员国的支持下，在阿尔及利亚进行着灭绝种族的屠杀。在这场屠杀中死亡的人数已经达到六十万——占阿尔及利亚人口总数的二十分之一左右。现在，是亚非人民加强行动来制止法国这种血腥暴行的时候了。”阿拉伯人民大会的代表阿德夫·达尼尔先生激动地对记者这样说。
    达尼尔先生是来我国参加“声援阿尔及利亚日”的活动的。当记者访问他的时候，谈话很自然地从萨基埃德事件开始了。因为，这是在亚非人民团结大会通过关于阿尔及利亚问题的决议以后发生的，而且是和阿尔及利亚局势密切有关的一个重大事件。达尼尔先生愤慨地说：“从法国惨无人道地轰炸突尼斯和平居民的这件事就可以看出，法国在阿尔及利亚干的是什么勾当。三年多来，在阿尔及利亚发生的像萨基埃德事件那样的惨案，是数也数不清的。”
      “在阿尔及利亚的这场流血为什么不能结束呢？”达尼尔先生提出了这个问题以后又马上自己答复道：“障碍是法国政府一直不肯采取现实的态度。其实，三年多的战争已经证明，军事镇压是不能解决问题的；对法国说来，只有承认阿尔及利亚的独立才是明智的做法。”
    记者告诉他，不久以前，法国外交部长比诺还重弹了一次殖民主义的滥调，说阿尔及利亚有着一百万欧洲籍的居民，因此它是法国的一个省份，而不应该得到独立。
    达尼尔先生以讽刺的口吻说：“在美国加利福尼亚州有三百万意大利籍的居民。意大利是否可以说它是意大利的一个省呢？”他接着指出：在阿尔及利亚的一百万欧洲籍居民并不完全是法国籍的，有相当一部分人原籍是意大利或者西班牙；而且，很多欧洲籍居民也并不同意法国的殖民政策。法国政府把这一点作借口，目的不过是想掩盖为了一小撮殖民主义分子的利益而发动‘肮脏战争’的实质。”
    达尼尔先生从盖伊阿提出的西地中海联盟谈起，谈到了美国对阿尔及利亚问题的态度。他说：“联合国大会几次讨论阿尔及利亚问题的情况表明，美国是支持法国的殖民主义政策的。而且，法国在战争中还得到了美国在财政上和军火上的援助。美国的这种做法，不但使阿尔及利亚人民受到更大的牺牲和损失，而且还构成了对世界和平的威胁。”稍停了片刻以后，他又回过来表示了他对西地中海联盟的看法：“筹组这个集团的目的，是想把整个北非西方化。但是，阿尔及利亚未来的政治方向决不是盖伊阿或者杜勒斯之流所能决定的。阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线已经发表声明反对西地中海公约计划，就清楚地表明了阿尔及利亚人民的意志。”
    在谈话将要结束的时候，阿拉伯人民大会的这位代表斩钉截铁地说：“阿拉伯人民把阿尔及利亚兄弟的战斗看作自己的战斗。阿拉伯人民坚决相信阿尔及利亚人民将赢得民族独立和自决的权利。”他要求中国人民给阿尔及利亚人民以更多的支持。
    是的，全中国六亿人民一直深切地关怀着战斗中的阿尔及利亚人民。正像出席亚非人民团结大会的中国代表团团长郭沫若在大会上说过：“朋友的斗争也就是我们的斗争！”在这次“声援阿尔及利亚日”的活动中，达尼尔先生将会深刻地看到这一点。
