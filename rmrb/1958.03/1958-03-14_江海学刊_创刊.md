    "Jianghai Academic Journal" Launched

    The "Jianghai Academic Journal" was launched in Nanjing on March 1. This journal is an academic publication in the fields of philosophy and social sciences under the leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. The "Inaugural Statement" of the journal emphasized that "Marxism-Leninism is its soul and guiding ideology," requiring that theory must be linked to practice, must be combined with practice and with the masses, creatively applying Marxism to summarize the practical experiences of the masses, elevate them to the level of theory, and use them to guide the actions of the masses.

    Comrade Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, wrote an article for the inaugural issue of "Jianghai Academic Journal" titled: "Be Promoters." Sun Shuping, editor-in-chief of the journal and vice president of Nanjing University, published an article entitled "A Tentative Discussion on the Internal Contradictions of Socialist Society."
