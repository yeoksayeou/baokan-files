    Washing and Repairing Locomotive Records Broken Three Times
    Xinhua News Agency report: Workers at the Chengdu Railway Bureau have broken the national record for the shortest locomotive washing and repair time three times in one week.
    The latest record of washing and repairing a locomotive in five hours and twenty-five minutes was created by employees of the Jiulongpo Locomotive Depot on March 5th. In the week prior, this depot and the Chengdu Locomotive Depot had broken the national record for the shortest locomotive washing and repair time with times of five hours and thirty-five minutes and six hours and five minutes, respectively.
    According to the original plan of this bureau, the washing and repair time for each locomotive should be reduced to 11.5 hours by 1962; this year's plan was 22 hours. But this backward target has now been left far behind by the workers.
    Shortening the locomotive washing and repair time has significant economic implications for the railway transport sector. According to the Ministry of Railways regulations, each locomotive needs to be sent to the locomotive depot for washing and repair after running 6,000 kilometers. Based on the current average speed of locomotives at the Chengdu Railway Bureau, if a locomotive is released from washing and repair one hour earlier, it can transport an additional 1,000 tons of goods and create more than 100 yuan of wealth for the country.

    洗修机车纪录三次刷新
    据新华社讯　成都铁路管理局职工在一周内连续三次刷新了全国洗修机车时间最短的纪录。
    以五小时二十五分钟洗修一台机车的最新纪录，是九龙坡机务段职工在3月5日创造的。在这以前的一周内，这个段和成都机务段曾经以五小时三十五分和六小时五分的时间，分别打破了全国洗修机车时间最短的纪录。
    按照这个局的原订规划，到1962年，每台机车的洗修时间是缩短到十一点五小时；今年的计划是二十二小时。可是这个落后的指标，现在被职工远远地抛在后面了。
    缩短机车洗修时间，对铁路运输部门有着重大的经济意义。按照铁道部规定，每台机车行驶六千公里以后，就需要送进机车库洗修一次。以成都铁路管理局机车现在每小时的平均行驶速度计算，如果洗修机车早出库一小时，就能多运输货物一千吨，为国家多创造一百多元的财富。
