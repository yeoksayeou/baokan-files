Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 12th: Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama stated on the 11th during a session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, in response to a question from a member of the Japan Socialist Party, that Japan does not intend to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. He also said that Japan is not currently prepared to establish a Northeast Asia Treaty Organization with the Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan and South Korea.

Fujiyama said that he believes it would be better for the East and West to hold serious talks at the highest level on steps to be taken to establish genuine world peace, rather than to establish such a new organization.

    日外相说了识时务的话
    日本不想参加马尼拉集团
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本外务相藤山爱一郎11日在众议院预算委员会会议上答复日本社会党议员的质询时说，日本不打算参加东南亚条约组织。他还说，日本在目前也不准备同台湾蒋介石集团和南朝鲜建立一个东北亚条约组织。
    藤山说，他认为，东西方在最高级水平上就建立真正世界和平所应采取的步骤进行认真的会谈，总比建立这样一个新的组织好些。
