Xinhua News Agency, March 19th—The 95th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress was held this afternoon.

The meeting passed a resolution approving the Treaty of Friendship, Treaty of Commerce, and Agreement on Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen.

The meeting passed the Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the Number of Deputies to Local People's Congresses at All Levels. Before the decision was passed, Zhang Su, Chairman of the Bills Committee, gave an explanation. He said that in recent years, due to the adjustment of administrative regions and the merger of establishments, the number of deputies to some provincial people's congresses has exceeded the provisions of the Electoral Law. For example, Sichuan Province has 205 counties, cities, and 3 autonomous prefectures, with a population of more than 70 million. According to the provisions of the Electoral Law, the number of provincial deputies should not exceed 600 at most. However, due to the merger of Xikang with Sichuan and the change of Chongqing into a city under provincial jurisdiction, the existing number of deputies has reached 801. Because the province has a large population, many ethnic minorities, and more administrative units under its jurisdiction, the existing number of provincial deputies is difficult to reduce, and the maximum number stipulated by the Electoral Law can no longer meet the actual needs. Other provinces such as Guangdong, Hebei, and Liaoning have similar situations. Zhang Su said that after agricultural cooperation, many places have expanded the administrative area of townships, with some townships having populations of more than 20,000 and some having populations of more than 50,000. According to the decision made by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in 1956, the number of deputies to the township people's congress should not exceed 70 at most, which is difficult to adapt to the actual situation of these townships. With the expansion of the administrative area of townships, the number of townships under county jurisdiction has been greatly reduced. Some counties only have more than a dozen townships under their jurisdiction. According to the decision made by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in 1956, a township with a population of more than 7,000 can elect at most 9 deputies to the county people's congress, so that the number of county deputies is greatly reduced, and it is impossible to properly elect representatives from all walks of life. Some cities and city-administered districts have the same situation. Zhang Su said that in order to avoid amending laws and decrees at every turn, this decision was drafted; at the same time, in order to prevent some localities from inappropriately increasing the number of deputies, the decision also stipulated certain approval procedures.

The meeting passed a resolution based on the proposal of Premier Zhou Enlai, approving the State Council's change of the State Bureau of Metrology to a bureau affiliated to the State Technology Commission, the change of the General Bureau of Materials Supply to a bureau affiliated to the State Economic Commission, the change of the Central Handicraft Industry Administration to a bureau affiliated to the Ministry of Light Industry, and the change of the Civil Aviation Administration of China to a bureau affiliated to the Ministry of Communications.

The meeting also passed resolutions approving the organizational regulations of the people's congresses and people's committees at all levels of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province; approving the organizational regulations of the people's congress and people's committee of the Sandu Shui Autonomous County in Guizhou Province; approving the organizational regulations of the people's congress of the Songtao Miao Autonomous County in Guizhou Province and the organizational regulations of the people's committee of the Songtao Miao Autonomous County in Guizhou Province. Chairman Mao Zedong has, according to the resolutions of the meeting, ordered the promulgation of these organizational regulations.

Finally, the meeting heard a report by Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, on the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign and rectification in state organs.

Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Issues Concerning the Number of Deputies to Local People's Congresses at All Levels

Adopted at the 95th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on March 19, 1958

The 95th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decided on March 19, 1958: Due to the expansion of administrative regions or the merger of establishments, the number of deputies to local people's congresses at all levels may exceed the number stipulated in the Electoral Law. When the number of deputies to the provincial people's congress needs to exceed the number stipulated in the Electoral Law, it shall be approved by the State Council. When the number of deputies to the county people's congress needs to exceed the number stipulated in the Electoral Law, it shall be approved by the provincial people's committee. When the number of deputies to the township people's congress needs to exceed the number stipulated in the Electoral Law, it shall be approved by the county people's committee.

Due to the expansion of administrative regions or the merger of establishments, when the number of deputies to the people's congresses of counties, cities, city-administered districts, townships, ethnic townships, and towns that should be elected to the people's congresses at the next higher level needs to exceed the number stipulated in the Electoral Law, it shall be approved by the people's committee at the next higher level.

    全国人民代表大会常委会举行会议
    批准中也友好条约
    通过关于地方各级人民代表大会代表名额问题的决定
    新华社19日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会第九十五次会议，在今天下午举行。
    会议通过决议，批准中华人民共和国和也门穆塔瓦基利亚王国友好条约，商务条约，科学、技术和文化合作协定。
    会议通过了全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于地方各级人民代表大会代表名额问题的决定。在通过这个决定前，法案委员会主任委员张苏作了说明。他说，近几年来，由于行政区域的调整和建制的合并，有些省人民代表大会代表名额已超过选举法的规定。例如，四川省辖二百零五个县、市和三个自治州，人口七千多万，依照选举法的规定，省代表名额最多不超过六百人，但因西康与四川合并，重庆市改为省辖市，现有代表名额已达八百零一人。由于该省人口多，少数民族多，所辖行政单位也较多，现有省代表名额难以减少，选举法所定的最高名额已不能适应实际的需要。其他如广东、河北、辽宁省也有类似情况。张苏说，在农业合作化以后，许多地方扩大了乡的行政区域，有些乡人口多到两万以上，有的乡人口多到五万以上，依照人大常委会一九五六年所作决定，乡人民代表大会代表名额最多不超过七十人，很难适应这些乡的实际情况。随着乡的行政区域扩大，县辖乡的数目大为减少，有些县只辖十多个乡，依照人大常委会一九五六年所作决定，人口在七千人以上的乡至多选举县人民代表大会代表九人，以致县代表的人数大为减少，不能适当选出各方面的代表人物。有些市和市辖区也有同样情况。张苏说，为了避免动辄修改法律法令，所以拟了这个决定；同时，为了防止某些地方不适当地增加代表名额，决定中又规定了一定的批准手续。
    会议根据周恩来总理的建议通过了决议，批准国务院将国家计量局改为国家技术委员会的会属局，将物资供应总局改为国家经济委员会的会属局，将中央手工业管理局改为轻工业部的部属局，将中国民用航空局改为交通部的部属局。
    会议还通过决议，批准吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州各级人民代表大会和各级人民委员会组织条例；批准贵州省三都水族自治县人民代表大会和人民委员会组织条例；批准贵州省松桃苗族自治县人民代表大会组织条例和贵州省松桃苗族自治县人民委员会组织条例。毛泽东主席已根据会议的决议，命令公布这些组织条例。
    会议最后听取了国务院秘书长习仲勋作的关于国家机关反浪费反保守运动和整改情况的报告。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于地方
    各级人民代表大会代表名额问题的决定
    1958年3月19日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第九十五次会议通过

    由于行政区域的扩大或者建制的合并，县、市、市辖区、乡、民族乡、镇人民代表大会应该选举的上一级人民代表大会代表的名额需要超过选举法规定的时候，由上一级人民委员会批准。
