    Xiaozhan Rice Seeds Support Various Regions
    The Xiaozhan rice varieties "Yinfang," "Suwon 300 Grains," and "Suwon No. 85" from the suburbs of Tianjin are all nationally renowned high-quality Japonica rice varieties with high yields and good quality. This spring, in the midst of the agricultural leap forward, various provinces have requested to transfer these good seeds. To date, five provinces, one municipality, and state-owned farms have transferred over 57.78 million jin of rice seeds, an increase of 1.4 times compared to 1956. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has also invited 153 experienced rice-growing farmers from Tianjin to help minority ethnic groups grow rice well.
    Planting Early-Maturing Crops for Staple Food
    Suining Prefecture in Sichuan Province is widely utilizing field ridges, roadsides, and private plots to increase the planting of early-maturing crops such as pumpkins and string beans. Suining County has increased the planting of 2.25 million pumpkin seedlings along roadsides and field ridges, and has also increased the planting of string beans in private plots. After these early-maturing crops are harvested, they can provide the county's people with ingredients to mix with their rice for four months.
