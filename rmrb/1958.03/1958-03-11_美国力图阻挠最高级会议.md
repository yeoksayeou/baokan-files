The attitude towards the summit conference is divided into two distinct types: one is to do everything possible to accelerate the convening of the conference, which is the attitude of the Soviet Union; the other is to try every possible means to delay and obstruct the convening of the conference, which is the attitude of the United States.

It is precisely because of this attitude of the United States that every time people see new hope for the convening of the conference due to the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union, the United States comes out to pour cold water.

In its memorandum to the U.S. government on February 28 and in Bulganin's reply to Eisenhower on March 3 (delivered on March 6), the Soviet Union accepted the wishes of the United States and other Western countries and suggested that a foreign ministers' meeting be held in April to formulate the agenda of the summit conference, determine the members to participate in the conference, and set the date and location for the conference. On the agenda issue, the Soviet Union also reiterated its own suggestions and accepted some of the views of the United States, willing to include issues such as banning the use of outer space for military purposes and removing foreign military bases on other countries' territories, concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and developing contacts and connections between countries on the agenda. This means that the Soviet Union has taken Western countries, especially the United States, into consideration as much as possible in two aspects, namely the preparation process and the agenda, in order to facilitate the early convening of the conference.

It stands to reason that since the Soviet Union has made such efforts, the differences in the preparation work of the summit conference should be readily solved, or at least closer to each other. However, the reality is not the case. Every time the Soviet Union takes a step forward, the United States retreats backward.

In a memorandum submitted on March 6, the United States gave a negative reply to the Soviet Union's suggestion on February 28. After receiving Bulganin's letter of March 3, the United States also rejected it unreasonably by the State Department a few hours later. The excuse for the United States' rejection of Bulganin's letter was that many of the arguments in Bulganin's letter were similar to those mentioned in the Soviet Union's memorandum of February 28. And the excuse for the United States' rejection of the Soviet Union's memorandum of February 28 was that the Soviet Union's proposal did not "meet" the "requirements" of the United States; its "requirement" was that "substantive preparation work must be carried out in some way in order to ascertain whether such a meeting (summit conference) meets the measurement standards accepted by the two governments." First of all, it should be pointed out that the U.S. response adopted a negative rather than a positive attitude toward the summit conference; its insistence on "substantial preparation work" was not to seriously prepare for the summit conference, but to "ascertain" whether the conference could be "accepted." The United States' attempt to negate the summit conference is very blatant in the U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's speech on March 4, when he said: "I don't see any reason to think... a summit conference must be held." Therefore, the United States insists on carrying out so-called "substantial preparation work," which is actually another precondition put forward by the United States for the summit conference, in order to continue to delay and obstruct the convening of the summit conference.

The question now is not whether or not a summit conference should be held, but how to speed up the holding of this conference. The current situation urgently requires this meeting. Isn't the accumulation of more and more new types of weapons, as well as the planes carrying nuclear bombs flying day and night over the United States and some Western European countries, threatening the lives and safety of people of all countries, and also the American people, every moment? So why not quickly end this disturbing and dangerous situation through a consultation between the heads of government of Eastern and Western countries? The people of all countries demand this. The proposal to hold a summit conference has become the most common desire of the contemporary era, and this desire is irresistible. The United States does not dare to openly and completely reject the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a summit conference, but attempts to negate the necessity of the summit conference with this or that precondition. This practice cannot but be condemned by the people and public opinion of all countries.

The U.S. memorandum and Dulles's March 4 speech both said that the known attitudes of all parties do not yet indicate the possibility of reaching an agreement on any major issues raised. Dulles believes that in such a situation, "there is no benefit to holding a summit conference." Therefore, the United States raises the question in its memorandum: "What is the purpose of holding a 'summit' conference? Is it just to put on a show for everyone, or to make meaningful decisions?" It seems that the United States is really taking the summit conference seriously.

However, this statement is untenable. In its repeated proposals, the Soviet Union has repeatedly pointed out that the summit conference should only discuss those issues that are already conditional and easier to resolve at present. Moreover, the issues proposed by the Soviet Union to be included in the agenda do indeed conform to this principle. These issues are: immediately stop testing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons; the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain abandon the use of nuclear weapons; establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe; the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states and the Warsaw Pact member states conclude a non-aggression agreement; reduce the foreign troops stationed in Germany and other European countries; formulate an agreement on preventing sudden attacks; measures to expand international trade relations; stop war propaganda; ways to ease the tense situation in the Middle East. These issues are all major issues that the people of all countries have long hoped to resolve, and there should be no difficulty in "making meaningful decisions" on these issues by reaching an agreement, as long as the countries concerned have a sincere desire to ease international tensions. It can be seen that the fact is not as the United States said, that there is no reasonable possibility of reaching an agreement on any important issue at present, but that the United States has no sincerity in easing international tensions and stopping the "Cold War." The United States has shown a stubborn attitude of "not doing it even if it benefits the world by plucking out a hair."

The seemingly serious attitude of the United States towards the summit conference is truly "to put on a show for everyone." On the one hand, it is not interested in issues that can truly ease international tensions and satisfy the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries, while on the other hand, it stubbornly and repeatedly raises issues that are enough to cause the deterioration of the international situation, such as the so-called situation in Eastern European countries and the unification of the two Germanys, which are purely internal affairs of the countries concerned, as projects for the summit conference to discuss. The Soviet Union's refusal to discuss such issues shows that the Soviet Union firmly opposes interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and also shows that the Soviet Union opposes leading the summit conference to a path of failure. If the summit conference, in accordance with the wishes of the United States, includes the above-mentioned issues it raised in the agenda, it will definitely be opposed by the people of all countries, because it violates the basic norms of international behavior and runs counter to the expectations of the people of all countries for the summit conference.

The United States is so ill-intentioned, but in its memorandum, it wants to make it seem as if the Soviet Union's opposition to discussing the issue of the unification of the two Germanys is "disregarding" the work that was not completed at the 1955 Geneva Summit Conference, and as if the Soviet Union is even unwilling to discuss the issue of disarmament. This is completely reversing black and white. The ten proposals put forward by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions are precisely to remove the obstacles to the restoration of German unification and to promote the settlement of the disarmament issue. Suggestions such as establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe and reducing the foreign troops stationed in Germany and other European countries are to consolidate the security of Europe and help the rapprochement of the two Germanys. But the United States refuses to discuss these issues, and insists on depriving the German people of the right to solve their own problems, which can only solidify the situation of Germany being divided into two parts. As for the issue of disarmament, in addition to the suggestions already put forward by the Soviet Union to immediately stop nuclear tests and abandon the use of nuclear weapons, and to formulate an agreement on the prevention of sudden attacks, which are sufficient to break the deadlock in the disarmament issue, Bulganin also stated in his letter to Eisenhower that the Soviet Union is willing to immediately sign a treaty, under appropriate international supervision, to completely ban all types of nuclear weapons, stop its production, abolish such weapons from armaments and destroy all existing stockpiles. The Soviet Union's attitude is so solemn and clear, but the United States has not even agreed to such an easy thing as immediately stopping nuclear tests. What a stark contrast!

The United States raised the question of the so-called "purpose" of the summit conference in its memorandum, as well as the distorted statement about "disregarding" the unfinished work of the first summit conference, which is nothing more than to create more obstacles to the preparation work of the summit conference. Therefore, the U.S. memorandum said: "It seems necessary to first reach a consensus on the nature and purpose of the summit conference before these other issues (i.e., the preparation work for the summit conference) can be usefully considered at this time." Obviously, the United States is trying to provoke futile disputes on extremely clear issues, in order to put the discussion of the preparation work for the summit conference on hold.

The United States wants to delay the convening of the summit conference again and again, adding obstacles upon obstacles, and its purpose is very clear. It wants to use this means to obstruct the easing of the international situation, in order to accelerate the completion of its steps to expand its arms race and prepare for war. During this period, it has been seen that the United States has signed an agreement with Britain to set up medium-range missile bases in Britain, and is also preparing to set up such bases in other Western European countries. At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles rushed to Manila to attend the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting, in order to force the countries of this group to accept the armament of U.S. atomic weapons and step up interference in the internal affairs of Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. All these practices of the United States are heading towards pushing the international situation to a more tense road. Therefore, it fears the prospect of the summit conference leading the international situation to a peaceful direction.

However, this practice of the United States is in vain. The more the United States intensifies its creation of international tensions and delays the summit conference, the more the people of all countries and peace-loving countries feel the urgent need to ease international tensions and accelerate the convening of the summit conference. At present, a strong movement against the establishment of U.S. medium-range missile bases in Britain has been launched in Britain, and the attitude of the people of other Western European countries against U.S. medium-range missile bases is becoming increasingly firm. The call for an early summit conference is growing in Western countries, and even Stassen, the former disarmament advisor to the U.S. President, does not agree with the U.S.'s stubborn attitude on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests and the summit conference. In Asian countries, Indian Prime Minister Nehru's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Asia as in Europe has received increasingly widespread sympathy and support. Under such circumstances, the United States continues to adhere to its policy of stepping up its arms race, preparing for war, and creating tensions, and delaying the holding of the summit conference, which can only arouse more resolute opposition from the people and public opinion of all countries, and further isolate it.

Reality has once again taught people that peace cannot be obtained by begging imperialism. This contradiction between the people of all countries demanding peace and imperialism fearing peace can only be resolved by relying on all the peace-loving forces of the world, persevering in strengthening the struggle for peace, and forcing the United States to abandon its policy of continuing to delay and obstruct the convening of a high-level meeting. Now that we have forced the United States not to openly oppose the convening of a summit conference, we also have the confidence and strength to defeat any delaying and obstructive steps taken by the United States in the future, so as to promote the early convening of the summit conference.

### 美国力图阻挠最高级会议

    美国力图阻挠最高级会议
    在对待最高级会议的问题上有着两种截然不同的态度：一种态度是尽一切可能来加快会议的召开，这是苏联的态度；另一种态度则是千方百计地设法拖延和阻挠会议的召开，这是美国的态度。
    正是由于美国的这种态度，所以每当人们看到由于苏联的不懈努力，使会议的召开有了新的希望的时候，美国就出来泼一盆冷水。
    苏联在2月28日给美国政府的备忘录中和3月3日（在3月6日递交的）布尔加宁答复艾森豪威尔的信中，接受了美国和其他西方国家的愿望，建议在4月召开外长会议，来制定最高级会议的日程，确定参加会议的成员和举行会议的日期和地点。在议程问题上，苏联也重申了自己的建议，并且接受了美国的某些看法，愿意把关于禁止把宇宙空间用于军事用途和撤除外国在别国领土上的军事基地问题、缔结对德和约问题、关于发展各国之间的联系和接触的问题等列入议程。这就是说，苏联在两方面，即在准备程序和议程的方面，都是尽可能地考虑西方国家，特别是美国的意见，以利于促进会议的早日召开。
    照说，苏联既然作了这样的努力，那么，在最高级会议准备工作问题上的分歧应该是迎刃而解，至少也应该是比较接近了。可是，事实却不然。每当苏联前进一步，美国就又向后退缩了。
    美国在3月6日提出的备忘录中，对苏联2月28日的建议作了否定的答复。美国在接到布尔加宁3月3日的信件以后几小时，也由国务院毫无道理地加以拒绝了。美国拒绝布尔加宁信件的借口是，布尔加宁信中的许多论点同苏联2月28日的备忘录中所提到的论点相似。而美国拒绝苏联2月28日备忘录的借口则是，苏联的建议还“不能满足”美国的“要求”；它的“要求”是，“必须以某种方式进行实质性的准备工作，以便查明这样一个会议（最高级会议）是否符合两国政府所接受的衡量标准”。首先应该指出，美国的答复是对最高级会议采取了否定的而不是肯定的态度；它所以坚持要“进行实质性的准备工作”，并不是认真地要为最高级会议作好准备，而是为了要“查明”这个会议是不是可以被“接受”。美国竭力要否定最高级会议的态度在美国国务卿杜勒斯3月4日的谈话中有非常露骨的表白，他说：“我看不出有任何理由来认为……非举行最高级会议不可。”所以，美国坚持要进行所谓“实质性的准备工作”，实际上这是美国又一次为最高级会议提出了先决条件，以便继续拖延和阻碍最高级会议的召开。
    现在的问题不是应该或不应该举行最高级会议的问题，而是如何来加速举行这个会议的问题。现实的局势迫切地要求着这个会议。难道越来越新型的武器的堆积，以及在美国和西欧一些国家上空昼夜飞行的携带着核弹的飞机，不是每时每刻都威胁着各国人民，也威胁着美国人民的生命和安全吗？那么，为什么不赶快通过一次东西方国家政府首脑的商谈，来结束这种使人不安的危险局势呢？各国人民要求这样。举行最高级会议的主张已经成为当代最普遍的愿望，这个愿望是不可抗拒的。美国不敢公然完全拒绝苏联举行最高级会议的建议，却企图以这种或那种先决条件来否定最高级会议的必要性，这种做法是不能不受到各国人民和舆论的谴责的。
    美国的备忘录和杜勒斯3月4日的谈话都说，目前各方已知的态度还不能表明对所提出的任何重大问题有可能达成协议。杜勒斯认为，在这样的情况下，“举行一次最高级会议是不可能有什么益处的”。因此，美国在备忘录中提出这样的问题：“举行‘最高级’会议的目的是什么呢？仅仅是为了装装样子给大家看呢，还是为了作出有意义的决定？”看来，美国真好像是在认真地对待最高级会议似的。
    然而，这种说法是不能自圆其说的。苏联在自己屡次提出的建议中曾一再指出，最高级会议只应当讨论那些目前已经有条件，而且也比较容易解决的问题。并且，苏联所提出的应当列入议程的各项问题，也的确是符合于这个原则的。这些问题是：立刻停止试验原子武器和氢武器；苏、美、英放弃使用核武器；在中欧建立无原子武器区；北大西洋联盟参加国和华沙条约参加国之间缔结互不侵犯协定；缩减驻扎在德国和欧洲其他国家境内的外国军队；就有关防止突然进攻的问题拟定协定；扩大国际贸易关系的措施；停止战争宣传；缓和中近东地区紧张局势的途径。这些问题都是各国人民早就渴望解决的重大问题，就解决这些问题取得协议，是不会损害任何国家的利益的。只要有关国家具有缓和国际局势的真诚愿望，在这些问题上“作出有意义的决定”是不应该有什么困难的。由此可见，事实并不是像美国所说的那样，在目前还没有任何重要问题具有达成协议的合理可能性，而是美国对于缓和国际局势和停止“冷战”的努力没有诚意。美国表现了“拔一毛利天下而不为”的顽固态度。
    美国对最高级会议那种好像是认真的态度，才真正是“为了装装样子给大家看”的。它一方面对真正能够缓和国际局势、满足各国人民和平愿望的问题不感兴趣，而另外一方面却顽固地一再提出足以引起国际局势恶化的问题，像所谓东欧国家的局势和两个德国的统一这一类纯粹属于有关各国内政的问题，作为最高级会议讨论的项目。苏联拒绝讨论这类问题，这表明苏联坚决反对干涉别国内政，并且也表明苏联反对把最高级会议引向失败的道路上去。最高级会议如果按照美国的愿望，把它提出的上述问题列入议程，这肯定会遭到各国人民的反对，因为它违背了国际行为的起码准则，并与各国人民对最高级会议的期望背道而驰的。
    美国是这样的不怀好意，但是它在备忘录中却要把事情说成好像是苏联反对讨论两个德国的统一问题，是把1955年在日内瓦举行的政府首脑会议所没有完成的工作“置之不顾”，并且好像苏联连裁军问题也不愿讨论。这完全是在颠倒黑白。苏联提出的关于缓和国际紧张局势的十项建议，正是为了解除恢复德国统一的障碍，并促进裁军问题的解决。像在中欧建立无原子武器区和缩减驻在德国和欧洲其他国家境内的外国军队这样的建议，就是为了巩固欧洲的安全并有助于两个德国的接近。但是美国却不肯讨论这些问题，而硬要剥夺德国人民解决自己问题的权利，这只能使德国分裂为两个部分的局面固定化。至于在裁军问题上，苏联除了已经提出立刻停止核试验和放弃使用核武器，以及就有关防止突然进攻的问题拟订协定这些足以打开裁军问题的僵局的建议外，布尔加宁在给艾森豪威尔的信中并声明，苏联愿意马上就在一项在适当的国际监督下完全禁止一切类型的核武器、停止它的生产、把这种武器从军备中废除并销毁一切现有储备的条约上签字。苏联的这种态度是何等的庄严而又明确，但是美国却直到现在为止连立刻停止核试验这样轻而易举的事都不肯同意。这是何等鲜明的对比！
    美国在它的备忘录中提出关于所谓最高级会议的“目的”的问题，以及关于对第一次政府首脑会议的未完成工作“置之不顾”的颠倒黑白的说法，无非是为了给最高级会议的准备工作制造更多的障碍。所以，美国的备忘录说：“看来有必要首先对于政府首脑会议的性质和目的求得一致的看法，然后才能在目前这种时候有益地考虑这些（即关于最高级会议准备工作的）其他问题。”显然，美国是企图在极其明白的问题上引起徒劳无益的争论，以便把对最高级会议的准备工作的讨论搁置起来。
    美国要把最高级会议的召开拖延再拖延，一层障碍之外再加一层障碍，其目的是非常明显的。它想用这种手段来阻挠国际局势的缓和，以便加速完成它的扩军备战的步骤。在这个期间，人们已经看到，美国已与英国签订了在英国设置中程导弹基地的协定，并且还准备在西欧其他国家也设置这种基地。与此同时，美国国务卿杜勒斯又赶到马尼拉来参加东南亚军事集团的会议，以迫使这个集团的国家接受美国原子武器的武装，并加紧干涉印度尼西亚以及其他东南亚国家的内政。美国的这一切做法都是朝着把国际局势推向更加紧张的道路上去。所以，它害怕最高级会议把国际局势导向和缓的前景。
    但是，美国的这种做法是徒劳的。美国愈是加紧制造国际紧张局势和拖延最高级会议，各国人民和爱好和平的国家就愈益感到缓和国际局势和加速召开最高级会议的迫切必要性。目前在英国已展开了一个反对在英国建立美国中程导弹基地的强大运动，西欧其他国家的人民反对美国中程导弹基地的态度也越来越为坚定。在西方国家中要求早日举行最高级会议的呼声正在增长，甚至连美国总统的前裁军顾问史塔生也不同意美国在停止核武器试验和最高级会议问题上的顽固态度。在亚洲国家中，印度总理尼赫鲁提出的在亚洲和欧洲一样建立无原子武器区的主张，得到了越来越广泛的同情和支持。在这种情况下，美国继续坚持它的加紧扩军备战和制造紧张局势政策，并拖延最高级会议的举行，只能招致各国人民和舆论更加坚决的反对，并使它进一步陷于孤立。
    现实再一次教育了人们，和平不是靠祈求帝国主义所能得到的。各国人民要求和平同帝国主义害怕和平的这个矛盾，只有依靠全世界一切爱好和平的力量，坚持不懈地加强争取和平的斗争，才能迫使美国放弃它继续拖延和阻挠召开高级会议的政策。我们既然已经迫使美国不敢再公然出来反对召开最高级会议了，那末，我们也有信心和力量能够击败美国继续采取的任何拖延和阻挠步骤，以促成最高级会议的早日召开。
