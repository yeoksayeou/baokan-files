One wave chases another, one surge follows another. This is an important method used by the An’guo County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to lead this year's production movement. We know that things change and develop in motion. The only way to promote faster development of things is to strengthen the movement of things themselves. To boil water faster, you need to add a quick fire. To achieve a great leap forward in production, it is necessary to organize a great leap forward production movement. However, organizing movements is often easier than persisting in them. People sometimes become complacent and slacken their efforts because of temporary achievements; sometimes they are hindered by some difficulties in the movement and stop. This is not conducive to striving for a great leap forward in production this year. Like the An’guo County Party Committee, one movement follows another, persisting throughout the year. Each movement is a labor competition, organizing visits and learning, and conducting summaries and evaluations. In this way, those who want to be proud have no time to be proud, and those who want to stop cannot stop; the backward catch up with the advanced, and the advanced become even more advanced, so that cadres and the masses maintain revolutionary vigor throughout the year. This is a good way to ensure a great leap forward in production and is well worth promoting.

    一波赶一波，一浪接一浪
    一个运动接着一个运动，一个高潮接着一个高潮。这是中共安国县委领导今年生产运动的一个重要方法。我们知道，事物是在运动中变化和发展的。促进事物更快的发展，唯一的办法就是加强事物本身的运动。要水快些烧开，就要加把急火。要生产大步跃进，就要组织大跃进的生产运动。可是，组织运动往往比较容易，坚持运动往往比较困难。人们有时会为一时的成绩而骄傲自满起来，松了干劲；有时会为运动中的一点困难拌住了脚，停下步来。这对于争取今年生产大跃进都是不利的。像安国县委这样做，一个运动接着一个运动，全年坚持下去，每个运动就是一次劳动竞赛，既组织参观学习，又进行总结评比。这样，使要骄傲的人来不及骄傲，想停步的也停不下来；落后的赶上先进，先进的更加先进，使干部和群众长年保持革命的朝气。这是保证生产大跃进的好办法，很值得加以提倡。
