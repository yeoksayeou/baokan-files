Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd: Spring Equinox has arrived, and various parts of Jiangsu Province have begun sowing.

The spring ploughing of 14 million mu of spring fields on the Xu-Huai Plain has been completed, and spring sowing has begun. Farmers in the southern Jiangsu region are preparing rice seedling beds for double-cropping early rice, and the first batch of rice seeds in Songjiang County has already been sown. Farmers in the Nantong and Yancheng cotton regions are carefully selecting cotton seeds and lowering the groundwater level in cotton fields, and are about to start sowing. As the sowing season approaches, water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, and soil improvement campaigns are being organized for continuous concentrated efforts in various places. Various agricultural tools manufactured and repaired by factories and handicraft cooperatives in various towns and cities are being continuously transported to the countryside.

Compared with previous years, this year's spring ploughing and sowing has seen a new situation of earlier action, greater momentum, faster pace, and better quality. In the Xu-Huai area, the average basal fertilizer for spring sowing in previous years was only a dozen or so dan, but this year, due to the construction of two million toilets, pigsties, and manure ponds in winter, the transformation of millions of ponds, and the widespread promotion of the improved stove soil fumigation method, the basal fertilizer for spring sowing generally reached 300 to 400 dan. Farmers reflected: in the past, they relied on the heavens for harvest, but now they rely on people, ensuring good plowing, good sowing, and good growth.

    打响春耕生产第一炮
    新华社南京22日电　春分已到，江苏省各地开始进行播种。
    徐淮平原上的一千四百万亩春田春耕已经结束，开始春种。苏南地区的农民正在整理双季早稻的秧田，松江县第一批稻种已经落谷。南通和盐城棉区的农民，正在精心地粒选棉种，降低棉田地下水位，即将播种。随着播种季节的临近，各地的水利、积肥、绿化和改良土壤运动，正在组织连续的突击。各城镇工厂和手工业社制造和修理的各式农具，正源源运往农村。
    今年的春耕春种和往年相比，今年出现了行动早、气势大、步伐快、质量好的新局面。徐淮地区往年春播基肥平均只有十多担，今年由于冬季修建了厕所、猪圈、水粪塘两百万个，成百万个汪塘翻了身，普遍推广了改灶熏土法，所以春播基肥一般都达到了三百担到四百担。农民们反映：过去是望天收，现在是望人收，保证耕得好、种得好、长得好。
