Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, March 14th: In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the Kailuan Coal Mine broke through conservative thinking and recently revised its leap forward plan for this year: coal production was increased from the original 9,550,000 tons to 11,100,000 tons. This indicator has surpassed the current Fushun Coal Mine; Fushun's leap forward target for this year is 11,100,000 tons.

The Kailuan Coal Mine is one of China's five major coal mines. Last year, its actual coal production was 8,379,000 tons. When formulating the annual plan at the beginning of this year, some leaders of the mine emphasized that the Kailuan Coal Mine is an old mine with many major difficulties in production links such as hoisting, transportation, and ventilation. At the same time, they felt that there was a shortage of labor. Therefore, the final coal production target for this year was set at 9,550,000 tons. At that time, the mine leaders thought that this was advanced enough.

However, after the launch of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, employees posted tens of thousands of big-character posters criticizing the conservative and backward nature of leading cadres within a few days. At the same time, the workers' enthusiasm for production was particularly high, and new production records continued to emerge. The Zhaogezhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine originally believed that the hoisting capacity of the large shaft was limited and could not exceed 8,500 tons per day at most. Later, the workers exposed the existing problems, broke with convention, and since the beginning of March, the average daily output of raw coal has been more than 9,000 tons. Recently, the workers in the transportation area also proposed to guarantee that they will reach 10,000 tons. The Tangshan Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine originally believed that there were many difficulties in production that could not be solved, and that it was not enough to complete a daily output of 5,700 tons in March; however, the workers were very motivated, and the highest daily output since March reached 6,200 tons, creating a new achievement that this mine had never had before.

Based on the workers' criticism, especially in view of the rapid increase in coal production in various mining areas, the Kailuan Mining Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kailuan Coal Mine General Management Office recently examined their conservative thinking, and after repeated research, finally decided to revise the original production targets.

### 开滦指标越过抚顺

    开滦指标越过抚顺
    据新华社唐山14日电　开滦煤矿在反浪费反保守运动中冲破保守思想，最近重新修订了今年的跃进计划：产煤量由原来的九百五十五万吨提高到一千一百一十万吨。这个指标，已经超过了目前的抚顺煤矿；抚顺今年的跃进指标是一千一百万吨。
    开滦煤矿是我国五大煤矿之一，去年它的实际煤产量是八百三十七万九千吨。今年年初制定年度计划时，矿的某些领导人员强调开滦煤矿是个老矿，在提升、运输、通风等生产环节上存在着许多重大的困难，同时又感到劳动力不足，因此最后确定的今年产煤指标是九百五十五万吨；当时，矿的领导上认为这已经够先进了。
    但是，反浪费反保守运动开展以后，职工们在几天之内，就贴出了成千成万张批评领导干部保守落后的大字报。在这同时，职工们的生产热情表现得特别高涨，新的生产纪录不断出现。开滦煤矿赵各庄矿原来认为大井提升能力有限，最多不能超过日产八千五百吨。后来工人揭发出存在的问题，打破了常规，从3月初开始以来，每天平均日产原煤都在九千吨以上，最近运输区工人又提出保证达到一万吨。开滦煤矿唐山矿原来认为生产上有许多困难不能解决，3月份完成日产五千七百吨还不行；可是工人的干劲很大，3月份以来日产量最高达到六千二百吨，创造了这个矿从未有过的新成绩。
    根据职工们的批评，特别是有鉴于各矿区现在的产煤量飞速上升，最近中共开滦矿党委和开滦煤矿总管理处检查了保守思想，并且经过反复研究，最后决定把原来的生产指标重新作了修订。
