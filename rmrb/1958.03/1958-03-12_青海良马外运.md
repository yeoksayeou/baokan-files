    Qinghai Fine Horses Transported Out
    This year, six thousand fine Qinghai Hequ horses and Datong horses will be supplied to agricultural cooperatives in Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other provinces.
    Hequ horses are tall, beautiful in appearance, docile in temperament, and highly adaptable; they can be used for both riding and draught purposes. The Datong horses produced in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture are also one of the excellent horse breeds.

    青海良马外运
    著名青海河曲马和大通马，今年将有六千匹供应河北、山西、陕西等省农业社。
    河曲马，体格高大，外形美观，性情驯顺，适应性强，可以乘挽兼用。海北藏族自治州所产的大通马，也是优良马种之一。
