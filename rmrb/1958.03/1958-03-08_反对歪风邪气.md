Oppose Unhealthy Tendencies and Evil Practices
Huang Songling, Vice Minister of Education

In the past few years, based on the gradual achievements in ideological remolding and teaching reform in our country's institutions of higher education, scientific research work has also been gradually carried out and great achievements have been made. This is the mainstream of events. But at the same time, there is also an unhealthy tendency and evil practice that hinders the progress of scientific research. These are: 1. Putting professional work first, and being detached from politics. The motto of this kind of person is "Turn a deaf ear to what's happening outside the window, and get an associate doctorate in three years." Under the control of this thought, engineering graduates are unwilling to go to factories, and put forward the slogan "Abandon the Northeast, strive for North China, and defend Beijing and Tianjin to the death." 2. Putting science first, and belittling teaching. "All occupations are lowly, only science is high." Teaching work is secondary, and is the business of lecturers and teaching assistants. It is beneath the dignity of great professors to teach. 3. Putting theory first, and belittling practice. Teachers are unwilling to go to the laboratory, unwilling to take students to production internships, one-sidedly emphasize theory, and are unwilling to serve production. 4. Putting conditions first, causing waste. As soon as scientific research is mentioned, they ask for money, people, houses, and equipment without any standards. Before the work has even started, a large amount of manpower and material resources are wasted. 5. Putting one's own unit first, disregarding the overall situation. Some units act independently, without communicating with each other, and are unwilling to cooperate. Sometimes two units are very close, within earshot of each other, but they never interact. 6. Putting the individual first, disregarding the collective. Research work starts from personal fame and interest, does not obey the needs of the country, and is unwilling to cooperate. All of the above are manifestations of bourgeois ideology and individualism in scientific research work. It is the capitalist road of scientific research, which is incompatible with the socialist road of scientific research. In the future, to carry out scientific research in institutions of higher education, we must carry out the struggle between the two roads and the two work methods, combine red and expert, advocate the spirit of innovation, oppose conservative ideas, and follow the mass line. We must correct the tendency of being detached from politics, vigorously implement the policy of combining with production and practice, strengthen collaboration, break down departmentalism, and run science diligently and frugally.

    反对歪风邪气
    教育部副部长　黄松龄
    过去几年，我国高等学校在思想改造和教学改革逐步取得成绩的基础上，也逐步开展了科学研究工作，取得了很大的成绩，这是事情的主流。但同时也有一股歪风邪气，阻碍着科学研究工作的进行。这就是：一、业务至上，脱离政治。这种人的格言是“两耳不闻窗外事，三年得个副博士”，在这种思想支配下，工科毕业生不愿下工厂，提出“放弃东北，争取华北，死守京津”的口号。二、科学至上，轻视教学。“万般皆下品，唯有科学高”，教学工作是末流，是讲师助教的事情，大教授教书，有失身份。三、理论至上，轻视实际。教师不愿去实验室，不愿带学生进行生产实习，片面强调理论，不愿为生产服务。四、条件至上，造成浪费。一提要进行科学研究，就漫无标准的要钱、要人、要房子、要设备，工作还未开始，就耗费一大批人力物力。五、本位至上，不顾全局。有些单位各自为政，相互不通声息不通有无，不愿合作。有时二个单位相距很近，鸡犬之声相闻，但老死不相往来。六、个人至上，不顾集体。研究工作从个人名利兴趣出发，不服从国家需要，不愿合作。以上这些都是资产阶级思想和个人主义在科学研究工作中的表现，是资本主义科学研究道路，与社会主义科学研究道路不相容。今后要开展高等学校的科学研究工作，必须进行两条道路和两种工作方法的斗争，要使红与专结合起来，要提倡革新精神，反对保守思想，要走群众路线。要纠正脱离政治的倾向，大力贯彻结合生产、结合实际的方针，加强协作，打破本位主义，勤俭办科学。
