    Zhang Jiazhong Group
    Completing Five Months of Work in Two Months
    This newspaper's special Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Zhang Jiazhong Group of the Xuzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory, which completed nine years' worth of work during the First Five-Year Plan, has completed five months' worth of work in the first two months of this year.
    In January of this year, all the workers of the Zhang Jiazhong Group used their brains to solve the problem of a malfunction in the large steam hammer, creating an outstanding achievement of completing two months and thirteen days' worth of work in one month. After February, their revolutionary drive was even greater, and their confidence in studying technology to ensure a leap forward in production was even stronger. Although forging safety hooks was a new task, and they were not skilled in the technology, Zhang Jiazhong used his holidays to study at brother factories, and upon returning, he worked day and night with the workers to study it, which resulted in an increase in output by more than double.
    In January and February, the group improved a total of ten sets of tools, molds, and operating methods.

    掌家忠小组
    两个月做完五个月的事
    本报特约新华社专稿  在第一个五年计划期间曾完成九年工作量的徐州农业机械厂掌家忠小组，今年头两个月又完成了五个月的工作量。
    掌家忠小组的全体工人，在今年1月份开动脑筋解决了大汽锤发生故障的问题，创造了一个月完成两个月零十三天工作量的优异成绩。2月份以后，他们的革命干劲更大，钻研技术保证生产跃进的信心更足。虽然锻打安全挂钩是个新活，他们技术不熟练，可是掌家忠利用假日去兄弟厂留学，回来跟工人们一起夜以继日地钻研，结果仍使产量提高一倍以上。
    在一、二月份，这个组共改进了十套工具、模具和操作方法。
