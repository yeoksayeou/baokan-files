    In Local Newspapers
    Everywhere the Sound of Reading
    The Henan Daily on the 8th dedicated an entire page to report the good news that Dengfeng County had achieved the status of "illiteracy-free county" ahead of schedule. It also published an editorial titled "Another Red Flag" to congratulate the people of Dengfeng on their victory in the great march towards culture. The news report stated that the county had more than 84,300 young and middle-aged illiterate people, of whom 68,000 had already shed their illiteracy. Now, most of the people in the county can basically read newspapers, write letters, and do calculations. At night, the sound of bells rings out, and lights shine in every household, with the sound of reading heard everywhere.
    Drinking Well Water
    The people of Changbai and Fusong counties in Jilin Province mostly live in mountainous areas and can only drink rainwater and snowmelt all year round, without access to well water or clean water. This often leads to endemic diseases, making them reluctant to live in the mountainous areas for long. Recently, the Party and government leaders of these two counties mobilized the masses to dig a total of eleven wells in the mountains. The masses were overjoyed and unanimously expressed their determination to work hard and build up the mountainous areas. The Jilin Daily reported this on the front page of its third edition on the 7th.
    Breaking Over a Hundred Targets
    Launching a fierce attack on waste, conservatism, bureaucratic style, and lethargy, while simultaneously breaking production quotas, this is the revolutionary drive displayed by the workers of the Wuhu Textile Factory in the Double-Anti Movement. According to a report in the Anhui Daily on the 8th, the factory's two thousand-plus workers wrote more than 10,000 big-character posters in two days. They not only sharply exposed the bureaucratic style and lethargy of the leadership but also bravely criticized their own conservative thinking, determined to show vigor and break production quotas. As good as their word, the factory's workers indeed broke 131 different production targets in two days.

    在各地报纸上
    处处读书声
    8日的河南日报以一版整版报道了登封县提前实现“无文盲县”的喜讯。并以“又一面红旗”为题发表社论，祝贺登封人民向文化大进军的胜利。新闻报道说这个县有八万四千三百多青壮年文盲，已有六万八千人摘掉了文盲帽子，现在全县人民大多数已经基本上能看书报、会写信、会算账。夜晚，钟声四起，万家灯火，到处都有读书声。
    喝上了井水
    吉林省长白、抚松两县人民大多住在山岳地带，常年只能吃到雨水和雪水，喝不到井水、清水，因此常得地方病，不安心在山区长住。最近，这两个县的党政领导发动群众一共在山地打了十一眼井，群众欢欣若狂，一致表示安心生产，建设山区。7日吉林日报以三版头条地位报道了这件事。
    突破百多项指标
    一面对浪费、保守、官风、暮气展开猛烈的攻击，一面纷纷突破生产定额，这是芜湖纺织厂职工在双反运动中表现出的革命干劲。据8日安徽日报报道，这个厂的两千多名职工，在两天中就写出大字报一万多张。他们不但尖锐地揭露了领导上的官风暮气，而且勇敢地批判了自己的保守思想，决心拿出干劲，突破生产定额。说得到做得到，全厂职工在两天中果然突破了各种生产指标一百三十一项。
