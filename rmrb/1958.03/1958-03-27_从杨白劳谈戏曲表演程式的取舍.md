Talking about how to use Peking Opera to express modern life, there are indeed many problems with artistic expression that remain to be solved. How to solve them? There are roughly two different opinions: one is to boldly break through the old performance conventions of opera and seek replacements from other arts such as drama and film; the other is to strive to inherit the art of opera performance and utilize and develop it. This is reflected in various different attempts in practice. Various attempts are good; but I think that in the process of experimentation, we should constantly summarize experience and constantly study experimental methods. My personal opinion is that if we are trying to use Peking Opera to express modern life, we should still strive to inherit the art of opera performance and develop it. This approach is more practical and more stable. If we completely abandon the performance methods of opera, it will become a case of "starting from scratch."

In the Chinese Peking Opera Theatre's "White Haired Girl," Comrade Li Shaochun's portrayal of Yang Bailao basically strives to inherit the performance art of old male roles in Peking Opera and utilize and develop it, rather than "starting from scratch." After watching it, we felt that the performance was very successful and very natural. It was natural because, due to the change in sleeves and beard, Comrade Li Shaochun could not use the original sleeve skills and beard skills; however, one can still see traces of sleeve skills in the rhythmic hand movements of the actor. Comrade Li Shaochun also retained opera performance conventions such as posing, kneeling steps, and acrobatics. Because it was combined with the requirements of portraying the character and the needs of the plot, this kind of performance was very successful, very well-done, and very natural. Comrade Li Shaochun also paid attention to the use of the eyes and the exaggeration of head movements (such as shaking his head when extremely angry, a bit like shaking his hat), and rhythmic movements. These also very well expressed the character's emotions. All of these obviously come from the performance conventions of Peking Opera. Because they are used appropriately, they are very brilliant. From this, we can see that the problem of opera performance conventions is not a matter of abandonment, but a matter of inheritance, utilization, and development. Thinking of "starting from scratch" will result in a hybrid that is neither one thing nor the other.

Opera performance conventions also have a process of development and formation. They come from life. The art of many predecessors, such as Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu, is so wonderful because they are constantly developing performance conventions. Cheng Yanqiu's water sleeves had more than two hundred types. Isn't that a process of accumulation and development? Our predecessors could develop in this way. Can't we also develop because we want to express new things and according to new living conditions? I think it is possible. At present, this requires us to first affirm tradition, be familiar with tradition, and understand its essence, and then talk about utilizing and developing it. I think Comrade Li Shaochun and others' approach is very successful! If we abandon traditional performance conventions, and have nothing to rely on, then we will become rootless grass and water without a source. Of course, we can still learn from other artistic expressions, but not copy them directly.

    从杨白劳谈戏曲表演程式的取舍
    林涵表
    以京剧表现现代生活，的确有许多尚待解决的艺术表现形式问题。如何解决呢？大致上有两种不同的意见：一是大胆突破戏曲旧有表演程式，而在其他话剧电影等艺术上寻求一些东西代之；一是竭力继承戏曲表演艺术并运用发扬。反映在做法上有各种不同的尝试。各种尝试是好的；但我觉得在试验中，我们应该不断总结经验，不断研究试验的方法。我个人的意见是，我们试图以京剧表现现代生活，还是应该竭力继承戏曲表演艺术并加以发扬，这样做比较实际一些，稳当一些。如果全部抛弃了戏曲的表现方法，就变成“另起炉灶”了。
    中国京剧院的“白毛女”中，李少春同志扮演的杨白劳，基本上是竭力继承京剧老生的表演艺术并运用发扬它，而不是“另起炉灶”。我们看完了，觉得表演很成功，很自然。自然，因为袖子和胡子的改变，李少春同志不能把原有的袖子工夫胡子工夫使出来；但是，还能从演员的有节奏的双手动作中看到袖子工夫的痕迹。李少春同志还保留了亮相、跪步、翻等戏曲表演程式。因为结合了表现人物的要求、结合了剧情需要，这样的表演是很成功，很到家，很自然的。李少春同志还注意到眼睛的运用，头部动作的夸张（如在气极时抖脑袋，有点像抖帽子），有节奏的动作，这些也都很好地表现了人物的感情。所有这些，显然是从京剧的表演程式中来的，由于用到是处，非常精彩。从这里，我们就可以看到，戏曲表演程式的问题不是抛弃的问题，而是继承运用与发扬的问题。想“另起炉灶”，就会变成四不像了。
    戏曲表演程式，也有它发展形成的过程。它是来自生活的。许多先辈如梅兰芳、程砚秋等，他们的艺术之所以如此精彩，就因为他们在不断发展表演程式。程砚秋同志的水袖有二百余种之多，难道不是日积月累发展之过程么？我们的前辈能这样发展，我们难道不能因为要表现新的东西，根据新的生活条件而发展么？我想，是可能的。当前，这就需要我们先肯定传统、熟识传统，揣悟出其中三昧，然后谈到运用发扬，李少春等同志的做法我看是非常成功的！如果抛开传统表演程式，要什么没有什么，那就变了无根之草无源之水了。当然，其他艺术表现形式我们还是可以借鉴的，但不是照搬。
