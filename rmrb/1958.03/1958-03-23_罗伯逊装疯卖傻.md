Robertson Plays the Fool

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson attacked the People's Republic of China like a madman at the U.S. Congress on March 20. He yelled and screamed that the only reason the United States "needs to build up its military strength in Asia today is because of the existence of a Red China." He also slandered the People's Republic of China as "the only threat to the independent status of Asian countries."

It is, of course, not surprising that people like Robertson hate the People's Republic of China so much. From the day of its birth, the masters in Washington have hated the People's Republic of China to the bone. This is because the complete liberation of the Chinese people has deprived U.S. monopoly capital of a major source of profit in Asia and dealt a fatal blow to the U.S. imperialist plan to enslave the Asian people. Therefore, they have never given up their activities against the Chinese people for a single second, fantasizing that the People's Republic of China would collapse one morning. But such dreams are becoming more and more impossible. Robertson's "testimony" in Congress is nothing more than a psychological reflection of despair and hatred.

However, Robertson's claim that the U.S. "military buildup" in Asia seems to be aimed solely at the Chinese people is clearly a deliberate deception. Not to mention the distant past, just looking at the facts since the end of World War II, the U.S. aggression and interference in Asian countries are too numerous to record. The U.S. not only armed the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique with six billion U.S. dollars to fight a civil war in China, but also aided the French colonialists with billions of U.S. dollars to carry out the Indochina War and aided the Dutch colonialists with 1.5 billion U.S. dollars to attack the Indonesian people. Its purpose was to turn these regions into U.S. spheres of influence and colonies. In order to "build up its military strength" in Asia, the U.S. cobbled together the Southeast Asia Group and the Baghdad Pact. These military groups are not only aimed at socialist countries; in fact, they have become tools for the U.S. to carry out large-scale colonial aggression in Asia. The U.S. once tried to use the Baghdad Pact to attack Syria and is currently using the Southeast Asia Group to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs, which is proof. At the same time, the U.S. has established a network of military bases on the territory of many Asian countries, stationed U.S. troops for a long time, and frequently conducts military exercises in Asia and the Pacific. Who does this threaten first? Obviously, those Asian countries "protected" by the U.S. and those Asian countries that adhere to an independent and peaceful policy are the first to be threatened. Recently, people have also seen the fact that most of the weapons supplied by the U.S. to the Indonesian rebel groups were smuggled through the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan. This most powerfully shows that the U.S. "military buildup" in various parts of Asia, including military activities in Taiwan, is not only to oppose the Chinese people, but to oppose the people of all Asian countries! It can be seen that Robertson's mad attack on the People's Republic of China is partly instinctive and partly feigned madness. He wants to use opposition to China as a smokescreen to cover up the U.S.'s arms expansion and colonial aggression throughout Asia.

Robertson's claim that the People's Republic of China is a "threat" to the independent status of Asian countries is even more slanderous! From the day of its establishment, the People's Republic of China has always unswervingly implemented a policy of peace and good neighborliness. Our country is the initiator and active executor of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Our government and people have always respected the independence of Asian countries. Robertson's claims of "Communist China's" "subversion" and "threat" to Asian countries are completely fabricated. Even U.S. Congressman Saund admitted after visiting Southeast Asia last year: "I have not seen any evidence of an imminent Communist threat, not even in Indonesia."

So, who is threatening the independent status of Asian countries? It is precisely the United States. To say nothing else, Indonesia is the most obvious example. The U.S. is unwilling to see the Republic of Indonesia embark on the road of independent development, so it constantly threatens, interferes with, and subverts the country, going to extremes by colluding with rebel groups and creating rebellious activities. Recently, the U.S. Air Force airdropped weapons to the rebels, U.S. warships sailed to the vicinity of Sumatra to cheer on the rebels, and U.S. Secretary of State Dulles personally came forward to equate the Indonesian government with the rebel groups, expressing that he would study the issue of "recognizing" the rebel groups. May I ask, what could be more rude and outrageous than the U.S.'s threat to Indonesia? Robertson avoids talking about these facts, but he still wants to bite back, which is truly rogue-like!

Robertson also attacked the Chinese people by using the Korean issue, saying that the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea "is only a withdrawal to somewhere behind the Yalu River." Robertson simply does not know what shame is. The Chinese People's Volunteers have begun to voluntarily withdraw from North Korea to their country, which is a peaceful action praised by the world. Now, people in Asian countries are questioning: When will the U.S. troops withdraw from Korea? However, Robertson turned a deaf ear to this, but he still wants to attack the Chinese People's Volunteers for not "withdrawing to behind the Yalu River" (!). Robertson's attempt to use such clumsy methods to cover up the U.S.'s isolated position on the Korean issue will only arouse greater indignation from the people of Asian countries.

It is not accidental that Robertson chose this time to frantically attack the People's Republic of China. Recently, in Asia, and in other parts of the world, the peace initiatives and efforts of peace-loving countries and people are having a profound impact, becoming a huge driving force for promoting the relaxation of the international situation. However, some reactionary groups and warmongers in the U.S. are very afraid of this peace trend. They are trying to step up the Cold War at all costs in order to create excuses for large-scale U.S. arms expansion and find a way out for the increasingly pressing U.S. economic crisis. However, the more fiercely people like Robertson shout, the more U.S. imperialism reveals its face as an enemy of the people of Asia and the world. This makes people see more clearly that the center of world reactionary forces is in the United States. If mankind wants to strive for world peace and a better future for the world, it must wage a resolute struggle against this most reactionary force. There is no doubt that no matter how frantic the clamor of people like Robertson is, it will ultimately not be able to overcome the power of the peaceful people!

    罗伯逊装疯卖傻
    美国助理国务卿罗伯逊3月20日在美国国会上发疯似地攻击中华人民共和国。他大喊大叫地说：美国今天“在亚洲需要整军经武的唯一原因就是因为有了个赤色中国”。他并且污蔑说：中华人民共和国是“亚洲国家独立地位的唯一威胁”。
    罗伯逊之流如此仇视中华人民共和国，这当然一点也不奇怪。中华人民共和国从诞生的一天起，华盛顿的老爷们就恨之入骨。这是因为中国人民的彻底解放，使美国垄断资本在亚洲丧失了一个最大利润的重要来源，使美帝国主义奴役亚洲人民的计划受到致命的打击。所以他们每一秒钟都不曾放弃反对中国人民的活动，幻想在某一个清晨中华人民共和国就会垮台。可是这样的梦是越来越做不下去了。罗伯逊在国会上所作的“证辞”不过是一种绝望和仇恨的心理反射而已。
    但是，罗伯逊说美国在亚洲“整军经武”似乎仅仅针对中国人民，这显然是故意骗人。远的不说，就从第二次世界大战结束以后的事实来说，美国对亚洲各国的侵略和干涉，也是罄竹难书。美国不但曾经以六十亿美元武装蒋介石反动集团在中国打内战，而且曾经以几十亿美元援助法国殖民者进行印度支那战争，以十五亿美元援助荷兰殖民者进攻印度尼西亚人民。它的目的都是想把这些地区变为美国的势力范围和殖民地。美国为了在亚洲“整军经武”，拼凑了东南亚集团和巴格达集团，这些军事集团也不仅仅是针对社会主义国家的，实际上它已成为美国在亚洲进行大规模的殖民侵略的工具。美国曾经想利用巴格达集团向叙利亚开刀，并且正在利用东南亚集团干涉印度尼西亚内政，就是证明。同时，美国在许多亚洲国家的土地上建立了星罗棋布的军事基地，长期驻扎美国军队，并且经常在亚洲和太平洋举行军事演习，这又首先威胁了谁呢？很显然，首先受到威胁的就是那些美国“保护”的亚洲国家，以及那些坚持独立和平政策的亚洲国家。最近，人们还看到这样的事实：美国供给印度尼西亚叛乱集团的大部分武器都是通过台湾蒋介石集团偷运去的。这最有力地说明，美国在亚洲各地“整军经武”，甚至包括在台湾的军事活动在内，都不仅仅为了反对中国人民，而是为了反对亚洲各国人民的！由此可见，罗伯逊发疯地攻击中华人民共和国，一半固然是本能，一半也是装疯卖傻，他想把反对中国作为一种烟幕，来掩饰美国在整个亚洲的扩军备战和殖民侵略。
    罗伯逊说什么中华人民共和国是亚洲国家的独立地位的“威胁”，这更是含血喷人！中华人民共和国从成立的一天起，就始终不渝地执行和平政策和睦邻政策。我国是和平共处五项原则的倡议者和积极执行者。我国政府和人民对亚洲各国的独立一贯是尊重的。罗伯逊所说“共产党中国”对亚洲国家的“颠覆”、“威胁”完全是捏造。连美国众议员桑德在去年访问东南亚之后也承认：“我没有看到任何证据说明眼前有共产党威胁，那怕在印度尼西亚也没有。”
    那么，威胁亚洲国家独立地位的究竟是谁？恰恰就是美国。别的不说，印度尼西亚就是最明显的例子。美国不愿意看到印度尼西亚共和国走上独立发展的道路，就不断地对这个国家进行威胁、干涉和颠覆，直到勾结叛乱集团，制造叛乱活动，无所不用其极。最近美国空军给叛乱分子空投武器，美国军舰开到苏门答腊附近给叛乱分子助威，美国国务卿杜勒斯亲自出面把印度尼西亚政府和叛乱集团相提并论，表示要研究“承认”叛乱集团的问题。试问，还有什么比美国对印度尼西亚的威胁更粗暴更放肆呢？对于这些事实，罗伯逊避而不谈，但是他还想反口咬人，这真是无赖之至！
    罗伯逊还借朝鲜问题攻击中国人民，说什么中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜“只不过是撤到鸭绿江后面的某一个地方”。罗伯逊简直不知羞耻为何物。中国人民志愿军已经从北朝鲜开始主动撤回国内，这是举世赞扬的和平行动。现在亚洲各国人民都在质问：美国军队究竟何时撤出朝鲜？但是，罗伯逊竟对此充耳不闻，却还要来攻击中国人民志愿军不该“撤退到鸭绿江后面”（！）罗伯逊想用这般拙劣的手法来掩盖美国在朝鲜问题上的孤立地位，这显然只会引起亚洲各国人民的更大的愤慨。
    罗伯逊选择这样的时候疯狂地攻击中华人民共和国，也不是偶然的。最近期间，在亚洲，和在世界其他地区一样，爱好和平国家和人民的和平倡议和努力，正在发生深刻影响，成为推动国际局势走向缓和的巨大动力。而美国一些反动集团和好战分子却十分害怕这个和平潮流。他们正想不顾一切地加紧进行冷战，以便为美国的大规模扩军备战制造借口，为日益逼人的美国经济危机寻找出路。但是，罗伯逊之流叫喊得越凶，美帝国主义就越露出了它同亚洲以及世界各国人民为敌的面目。这就使人们更清楚地看到，世界反动势力的中心是在美国。人类要争取世界和平，要争取世界的美好未来，就必须同这个最反动的势力进行坚决斗争。毫无疑问，罗伯逊之流的叫嚣不论怎样疯狂，终归是压不过和平人民的力量的！
