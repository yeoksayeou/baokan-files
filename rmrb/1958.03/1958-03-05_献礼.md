    A Gift for the Editor:
    When the news of the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region reached the ?zhai Village west of Munan Pass, everyone's enthusiasm for learning the Zhuang language was even higher. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, fourteen young people in the village ate breakfast and then took their stools to the home of teacher Huang Haibin to study. They said: Now that the Zhuang Autonomous Region has been established, the Zhuang language will be even more widely used. We must learn it so that we can better serve the people of all ethnic groups, and as a gift to the Autonomous Region.

    献礼编辑同志：
    广西僮族自治区成立的消息，传到睦南关西边的?寨屯时，大家学习僮文的热情更加高涨了。该屯有十四个青年大年初一吃了早饭，就带了凳子到教师黄海斌家去学习。他们说：成立了僮族自治区，僮文用途更广了，一定要学会它，以便更好地为各族人民服务，并作为给自治区的献礼。
