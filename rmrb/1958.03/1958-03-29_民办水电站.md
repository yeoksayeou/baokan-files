    Privately-Run Hydropower Station
    (Our Dispatch) A hydropower station is being planned and constructed in Minhe County, Qinghai Province. This station was proposed and built by the masses, with a construction investment of over 120,000 yuan, entirely funded by local residents and farmers. Once completed, it can generate 240 kilowatt-hours to 700 kilowatt-hours, supplying electricity for rural water pumping and lighting for the county town and Xiangtang Town. (Zhang Wencai)
