Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: The Polish government delegation led by Jaroszewicz was warmly welcomed by over 50,000 reservoir builders engaged in voluntary labor when they visited the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site today.

Accompanied by Wu Han, Vice Mayor of Beijing, Lu Xuzhang, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, and Kirilok, the Polish Ambassador to China, the Polish guests visited the reservoir construction site this afternoon.

Zhang Junshi, the Deputy Chief Commander of the reservoir construction site, guided the guests to a small hill in the construction headquarters to overlook the panoramic view of the construction site. The guests looked out and saw tens of thousands of reservoir builders working intensely under the warm sunshine in an area about eight li long and more than one li wide. They were all in high spirits, full of vigor, and walked with great strides. Vice Chairman Jaroszewicz praised, "This team is excellent!"

	"How many people participate in the labor every day?" the Vice Chairman asked the Deputy Chief Commander of the construction site.

	"More than 50,000 people every day. More than 30,000 of them are cadres from central and Beijing government organs, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, students from universities and middle schools, and shop assistants. They all volunteered to participate in voluntary labor."

	"What is the scale of the reservoir?" the Vice Chairman asked with concern.

	"After the reservoir is completed, it can hold 66 million tons of water, control floods in an area of more than 200 square kilometers, reduce waterlogging disasters on 200,000 to 300,000 mu of land, and more importantly, intercept the perennial floods and turn dry land into irrigated land, increasing grain production by 40 to 50 million jin per year."

When Vice Chairman Jaroszewicz learned that the earthwork of this reservoir was twice that of the Guanting Reservoir, which took nearly three years to build, and that this reservoir could be completed in less than five months, he happily said, "This is the drive of socialism, and also the speed of socialism!"

After walking down the small hill, the guests entered the ranks of the builders. Wherever the guests went, the builders greeted them with cheers and applause.

Vice Chairman Jaroszewicz spoke with many cadres from central government organs who were participating in voluntary labor. He said, "I am very happy to see you participating in voluntary labor. Our country is also fighting against water. It seems that we should learn from you and also start voluntary labor." The Vice Chairman smiled and said to a group of cadres from the Ministry of Railways, "You often take trains, so it seems you are not very used to labor, are you?" The cadres said, "Labor has universities, middle schools, and primary schools. We must first strive to graduate from primary school." The Vice Chairman smiled and said, "No, this is a very good political education university!"

On the dam, which was under intense construction, two young girls under the age of twenty were driving a tractor to compact the earth. The Vice Chairman stepped forward, and the two girls immediately jumped down and shook hands with him. The Vice Chairman said with delight, "You are driving such a big tractor at such a young age! Are you confident in running ahead of the flood?" The girls firmly replied, "We certainly can!" "Good, I wish you victory!" The Vice Chairman shook hands with the young girls again. These two young girls are students of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery School.

Among the ranks of the peasant labor force, Vice Chairman Jaroszewicz had an interesting conversation with an elderly member of the agricultural production cooperative. He asked the old peasant, "In your opinion, is it better for young people to work or for old people to work here?"

	"Young people work happily, and old people don't fall behind," the old peasant replied.

This old peasant is from Songtao Village, Changping District, named Weng Qinghuai. He told the guests that the most important thing for farmers to increase grain production is water, so he was particularly happy when he heard about building the reservoir. Half of their agricultural production cooperative stayed at home for spring plowing, and half came here to build the reservoir. Their slogan is: "We will not go home until the reservoir is built!"

	"With the reservoir, you can produce more grain!" the Vice Chairman said.

	"This year, we plan to produce 400 jin of grain per mu."

	"There were so many emperors in Chinese history who did nothing for the people, but in just a few years after the establishment of the People's Government, so many factories were built and so many reservoirs were built. Under the leadership of the People's Government, it will not take many years to build China into a big garden," the Vice Chairman said to the old peasant with full confidence.

At the mention of the People's Government, the old peasant seemed to have a lot to tell the guests. He said, "Yes! The Ming Tombs is a very good testament to this. In the past, the emperors spent years building tombs for themselves, and they didn't care about the lives of the people at all. Today, our own government is leading us to build reservoirs here, asking us to produce more grain and improve our lives!"

The Vice Chairman also said to the old peasant, "Our People's Government wants to make the people's lives happier day by day!"

Finally, the guests met with the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who were participating in voluntary labor here. The soldiers put down their work and surrounded the guests, cheering and applauding. Vice Chairman Jaroszewicz said to the soldiers: As a person who used to be a general, I am very happy to see that you are working so well here. Whatever our soldiers do, they can only do well, not badly. More importantly, the army and the people must be closely united. We have seen here that the army and the people are already closely united. He also cheered, "Long live the Chinese People's Army!" At this time, Vice Mayor Wu Han, who accompanied the visit, led the soldiers to shout repeatedly, "Long live Sino-Polish friendship!" The soldiers were very grateful for the Vice Chairman's encouragement, and they replied loudly, "We will definitely go all out and complete the task of repairing the reservoir on schedule!"

Unconsciously, more than two hours had passed. When Vice Chairman Jaroszewicz left the reservoir construction site, he said to Deputy Chief Commander Zhang Junshi: "We are very happy to see so many people working in such an orderly manner. We wish you that your reservoir will be completed on schedule!"

Prior to this, the Polish guests toured the Great Wall.

After visiting the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, the guests toured the scenic spots of the Ming Tombs.

    波兰贵宾参观十三陵水库工地
    据新华社22日讯　以雅罗谢维奇为首的波兰政府代表团今天参观十三陵水库工地时，受到正在进行义务劳动的五万多水库建设者们的热烈欢迎。
    在北京市副市长吴晗、对外贸易部副部长卢绪章和波兰驻中国大使基里洛克的陪同下，波兰贵宾们在今天下午参观了这个水库工地。
    水库工地的副总指挥张俊士引导贵宾们登上工地指挥部的一座小山，眺望工地的全景。贵宾们极目一望，在大约八里长、一里多宽的地区内，成千上万的水库建设者在温暖的阳光下从事着紧张的劳动。他们个个情绪高涨，生气勃勃，走起路来健步如飞。雅罗谢维奇副主席满口称赞说：“这支队伍太好了！”
      “每天有多少人参加劳动？”副主席问工地副总指挥。
      “每天有五万多人。其中三万多人是中央和北京市的机关干部、解放军军官和士兵，大中学校的学生和商店的店员。他们都是志愿报名参加义务劳动的。”
      “水库的规模有多大？”副主席又关心地问。
    “水库建成以后，可以拦蓄六千六百万吨水，能控制二百多平方公里流域面积的洪水，减轻二、三十万亩土地的涝灾，更重要的是把连年为患的洪水拦蓄起来，把旱地变为水浇地，每年将增产粮食四、五千万斤。”
    当雅罗谢维奇副主席知道这个水库的土方比官厅水库多一倍，官厅水库修了近三年，而这个水库不到五个月就可以建成的时候，他高兴地说：“这是社会主义的干劲，也是社会主义的速度！”
    走下这座小山，贵宾们就进入了建设者的行列中。贵宾们走到哪里，哪里的建设者们就向他们发出欢呼声和掌声。
    雅罗谢维奇副主席同中央国家机关参加义务劳动的许多干部谈了话。他说：“很高兴看到你们来参加义务劳动。我们的国家里也在同水作斗争，看来我们应该向你们学习，也搞起义务劳动来。”副主席笑着对铁道部的一群干部说：“你们是常常坐火车的，看来对劳动还不大习惯是不是？”干部们说：“劳动有大学、中学、小学，我们首先要争取小学毕业。”副主席又笑着说：“不，这是很好的政治教育大学！”
    在正在紧张施工的拦河坝上，有两个不满二十岁的青年姑娘开着一辆拖拉机在压土。副主席走上前去，两个姑娘马上跳下来同他握手。副主席惊喜地说：“你们这样小的年纪开这样大的拖拉机！你们有没有把握跑在洪水前面？”姑娘们坚定地回答：“一定能够！”“好，祝你们胜利！”副主席再一次同年青的姑娘们握手。这两个年青姑娘都是北京农业机械学校的学生。
    在农民的劳动大军里，雅罗谢维奇副主席同一个年老的农业生产合作社社员进行了有趣的谈话。他问这位老农民：“在你们这里，青年人劳动好还是老年人劳动好？”
    “青年人干的欢，老年人也不落后。”老农民回答。
    这位老农民是昌平区松桃村人，名叫翁清淮。他告诉贵宾，农民增产粮食最重要的是水，所以，一听说要修水库就特别高兴。他们的农业生产合作社有二分之一的人留在家里春耕，二分之一的人到这里来修水库，他们的口号是：“不修好水库不回家！”
    “有了水库你们就可以多打粮食！”副主席说。
    “今年我们计划每亩地生产粮食四百斤。”
    “中国历史上有多少皇帝，他们什么事情也不为人民办，而人民政府成立后没有几年，就盖了那么多工厂，修了那么多水库。在人民政府领导下，再用不到多少年，就会把中国建设成一个大花园。”副主席满怀信心地对这位老农民说。
    一提起人民政府，这位老农民就仿佛有许多话要告诉贵宾。他说：“对！在十三陵就是一个很好的见证。过去的皇帝成年累月在这里为他们自己修陵墓，人民的死活他们根本不管。今天，我们自己的政府却在这里领导我们修水库，要我们多产粮，改善生活！”
    副主席又对这位老农民说：“我们的人民政府，要使人民的生活一天比一天过得更幸福！”
    最后，贵宾们会见了在这里参加义务劳动的中国人民解放军的战士们，战士们放下了工作，包围住客人们欢呼鼓掌。雅罗谢维奇副主席对战士们说：作为一个过去曾当过将军的人，看到你们在这里劳动得很好，我非常高兴。我们的战士无论作什么事情，都只能作好，不能作坏。更重要的是军队和人民要紧紧团结在一起，我们在这里看到军队和人民已经紧紧地团结在一起了。他还欢呼“中国人民的军队万岁！”这时，陪同参观的吴晗副市长领导战士们连连高呼：“中波友谊万岁！”战士们非常感谢副主席的勉励，他们高声回答：“我们一定鼓足干劲，如期完成修水库的任务！”
    不知不觉地时间已经过了两个多小时。雅罗谢维奇副主席在离开水库工地时，对副总指挥张俊士说：“我们很高兴地看到，这样多人，这样有秩序地进行工作。祝你们的水库如期修好！”
    在这以前，波兰贵宾们游览了万里长城。
    在参观十三陵水库工地以后，贵宾们游览了明十三陵的名胜。
