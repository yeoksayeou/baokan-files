    Rehabilitate the Reputation of the Youth Expeditionary Afforestation Team
    Tao Lujia Encourages Youth to Outdo the Year Before Last
    (Our report) Shanxi Province has recently re-evaluated the Youth Expeditionary Afforestation Shock Brigade and intends to organize youth in suitable areas throughout the province to embark on expeditions to afforest barren mountains and wastelands.
    In 1956, Jinnan, Yanbei, and Changzhi regions mobilized a large number of rural youth to form expeditionary afforestation shock brigades, marching towards sparsely populated barren mountains, ridges, and wastelands. In the Jinnan region, over 40,000 young people from ten counties, including Xi, Wenxi, and Xia, shouldered seedlings, carried tools, and brought rations and tents, climbing high mountains and steep ridges. They planted saplings and sowed seeds on more than 50,000 mu of land, greening five large mountains in five days. In Yanbei, near the Sanggan River, 200,000 young people and farmers constructed two dense protective forest belts along both sides of the Sanggan River in one month. The youth in the Taihang Mountain region also created the miracle of "Greening a Thousand-Li Highway in One Day." According to inspections in various regions, the general survival rate reached 80%, and the survival rate along the Sanggan River reached over 95%. However, at the 1956 Shanxi Forestry and Soil Conservation Work Conference, some people emphasized on-site afforestation and underestimated the role of the expeditionary afforestation approach, considering it more harmful than beneficial and not worth promoting. Some places even negated this approach during the anti-rightist campaign. The once-sensational new form of expeditionary afforestation suffered setbacks.
    At the end of last year, Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, inspected work in the Jinxi mountainous area. After listening to the local Party committee's report on organizing youth expeditions to afforest barren mountains, he personally conducted an inspection at Baishan Temple, actively supporting the youth's initiative and encouraging them to surpass the year before last this year.
    Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Forestry Department and the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly convened a meeting on advancing towards the greening of the Yellow River and Fen River. While studying how to accelerate the realization of the task of greening barren mountains, wastelands, and rivers, they re-discussed the work of the Youth Expeditionary Afforestation Team, believing that this form is a good way to solve the problem of large afforestation tasks in deep mountainous wastelands with limited labor. Currently, thirty-eight counties and cities in the Fen River region have begun preparing to organize a large number of young people to participate in long-distance riverbank greening.

### 恢复青年远征造林队名誉  陶鲁笳勉励青年今年更要赛过前年

    恢复青年远征造林队名誉
    陶鲁笳勉励青年今年更要赛过前年
    本报讯　山西省对青年远征造林突击队最近重新作了估价，并要在全省有条件的地区，组织青年到荒山荒滩远征造林。
    1956年，晋南、雁北和长治地区曾动员了大批农村青年，成立远征造林突击队，向人烟稀少的大荒山秃岭、荒滩进军。晋南地区隰县、闻喜、夏县等十个县四万多个青年背上苗种，扛上工具，带上干粮和帐篷，攀登上高山峻岭，在五万多亩土地上，栽上了树苗，撒播了树籽，五天内绿化了五座大山。雁北靠近桑干河地区二十万个青年和农民，一个月内在桑干河两旁营造成两道密厚的护岸林带。太行山区的青年还创造了“千里公路一日绿”的奇迹。据各地检查：一般的成活率达到80％，桑干河沿岸成活率达到95％以上。但是，1956年山西林业、水土保持工作会议上，有些人强调了就地造林的作法，对远征造林这种形式的作用估计不足，认为这种作法利少弊多不宜提倡。有些地方在反冒进中甚至否定了这种作法。轰动一时的远征造林的新形式受到了挫折。
    去年年底中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳同志到晋西山地检查工作，听取了当地党委关于组织青年远征造林绿化荒山的报告，他亲临柏山寺进行了检查，积极支持青年的创举，勉励青年今年更要赛过前年。
    最近，山西省林业部门和共青团山西省委联合召开的绿化黄河、汾河进军会议，在研究加速实现荒山荒滩、河流绿化任务时，重新讨论了青年远征造林队工作，认为这种形式是解决深山荒滩造林任务大、劳力少的好办法。现在汾河两岸地区的三十八个县、市，已开始进行组织广大青年远程参加河岸绿化的准备工作。
