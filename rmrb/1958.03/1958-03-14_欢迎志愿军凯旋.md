You have returned, most beloved people! We express our welcome with the great leap forward in national production, and with the great leap forward in literature, art, science, and technology. In fact, you are the model of the Great Leap Forward, you are the great promoters led by the Party, promoting the nationwide Great Leap Forward of today.

On October 25, 1950, you embarked on your journey, at a time when the People's Republic of China was just one year old. The US imperialism, unwilling to accept its failure on the Chinese mainland, dared to launch the war of aggression against Korea—in fact, it was not merely invading Korea, but also occupying Taiwan and coveting Vietnam. It surrounded our newborn motherland, attempting to suffocate us, forming a crescent-shaped blockade at sea. It followed the old path of Japanese imperialism, and the flames of aggression against Korea finally reached the south bank of the Yalu River.

"Valiantly and spiritedly, we cross the Yalu River!" The resounding song echoed, a sea of red flags fluttered in the wind; most beloved people, you represented the will of all Chinese people, crossing the Yalu River to fight alongside our Korean brothers. Your heroic spirit and that of our Korean brothers shook the whole world, driving the invaders south of the 38th parallel in a very short period. You not only won a military victory, but also a moral victory; you not only defended the security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but also defended the security of our newborn motherland. You also promoted the recovery and production of Korea, and also promoted the recovery and production of our motherland. Your noble patriotism and internationalism have left a glorious chapter in human history.

When you first left the country, oh, most beloved people! Many people dared not believe that you could defeat US imperialism; but you finally punctured this paper tiger. You carried out a magnificent modern war with earth-shaking momentum, disrupting the strategic agenda of US imperialism to enslave all mankind. You inspired all peace-loving forces in the world, and provided a reliable guarantee for the hope of lasting peace. The victory of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea followed closely on the heels of the victory of the people's revolution, opening the eyes of all oppressed nations around the world. The wave of anti-colonialism and the struggle for national independence surged from Asia to Africa, promoting the great awakening of all mankind.

Great promoters, oh, most beloved people! Advanced models of the Great Leap Forward, oh, most beloved people! Today you have finally returned to the embrace of the motherland. All peace-loving people around the world are singing your praises, and all 600 million brothers and sisters in China wholeheartedly welcome you. Your open and upright actions can not only promote lasting peace, but also promote a larger-scale Great Leap Forward in national production.

This year is the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. In this glorious year, we welcome you, and your return will promote the cause of socialist construction even more, faster, better, and more economically. Currently, we are at war with the earth, with ten thousand horses galloping. Your return will make countless Shangganling appear on every front! Using the skill of digging trenches for water conservancy projects, and the skill of excavating air-raid shelters for opening coal mines, your heroic spirit can flatten Mount Everest and turn the vast Gobi Desert into hundreds of millions of acres of fertile land. We will catch up with Britain in industrial production in fifteen years, and catch up with international standards in scientific development in twelve years. Everyone is going all out, aiming high, and your return will add a new and vital force.

Imperialism is clearly lagging behind, although it is anxious and unwilling to admit defeat. In peaceful competition, it cannot compete with the socialist system; if it dares to launch a war, it will be digging its own grave. The policy of atomic blackmail has clearly gone bankrupt, but the most foolish Dulleses are still hovering on the edge of war; but the most ruthless thing is that there are already intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the Soviet Union's two huge artificial satellites have taken to the sky ahead of schedule.

The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow, we must hurry, hurry, hurry! Most beloved people, you are the great promoters led by the Party, and we welcome your return with the great leap forward in national production! Let us go all out and go to war with the earth together, first breaking the surface of the earth, and then conquering outer space. We must oppose waste and oppose conservatism, compare ourselves to the advanced, compare ourselves to our energy, and strive to make all 600 million people both red and expert. First, we must work hard for ten, fifteen, or twenty years, and we must leave the imperialists far behind. China must become a socialist industrial country, and lasting peace in the world must be realized.

    欢迎志愿军凯旋
    郭沫若你们回来了，最可爱的人！我们以全国的生产大跃进来表示欢迎，以文学、艺术、科学、技术各方面的大跃进来表示欢迎。事实上你们就是大跃进的模范，你们是党所领导的伟大的促进派，促进了今天全国规模的大跃进。1950年10月25日你们踏上了征程，在那时中华人民共和国刚刚满了一岁的年龄。美帝国主义不甘心在中国大陆的失败，它敢于发动了侵略朝鲜的战争——事实上它并不是单纯地侵略朝鲜，而是同时侵占了台湾，觊觎着越南，它包围我们新生的祖国，企图窒息我们，在海上布成了新月形的封锁线；它走的路是日本帝国主义的老路，侵略朝鲜的烽火终于燃到了鸭绿江南岸。“雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江！”响亮的歌声飘扬，一片红旗迎风招展；最可爱的人，你们代表了全中国人的意志，跨过鸭绿江，和朝鲜兄弟并肩作战。你们和朝鲜兄弟的英雄气概轰动了全世界，在很短的期间把侵略者赶到了三八线以南。你们不仅在军事上打了胜战，同时在道义上也打了胜战；你们不仅捍卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的安全，同时也捍卫了我们新生祖国的安全。你们还促进了朝鲜的恢复和生产，并也促进了祖国的恢复和生产。你们的崇高的爱国主义和国际主义精神，在人类史中留下了光辉的一篇。当你们初出国门的时候呵，最可爱的人！你们能够打败美帝国主义，很多人不敢相信；然而你们终于把这个纸老虎戳穿了，你们以翻江倒海的气势进行了轰轰烈烈的近代战争，打破了美帝国主义奴役全人类的战略日程。你们鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的力量，使持久和平的希望有了可靠的保证。抗美援朝的胜利紧接着人民革命的胜利，使全世界被压迫民族都睁开了眼睛，反殖民主义和争取民族独立的热潮，由亚洲冲到非洲，促进着全人类的大觉醒。伟大的促进派呵，最可爱的人！先进的大跃进模范呵，最可爱的人！你们今天终于回到祖国的怀抱里来了，全世界爱好和平的人民都在歌颂你们，全中国六万万兄弟姊妹都衷心地欢迎你们。你们的光明磊落的行动不仅可以促进持久和平，并将促进全国生产大跃进的更大规模的大跃进。今年是第二个五年计划建设的第一年，在这个光荣的年头对你们表示欢迎，你们回来会促进社会主义建设事业更多更快更好更
    省。目前我们正在向地球开战，万马奔腾，你们回来会使每个战线上都出现无数的上甘岭！以挖战壕的本领进行水利工程，以鑿防空洞的本领开辟炭坑矿坑，英雄气概可以把珠穆朗玛铲平，把大戈壁沙漠化为良田亿万顷。在工业生产上十五年赶上英国，在科学发展上十二年赶上国际水平，大家都在鼓足干劲、力争上游，你们回来便又新添了一只生力军。帝国主义分明已经落伍，虽然它在干着急而又死不服输。和平竞赛，它比不过社会主义制度；如果敢于发动战争，那就是挖掘自己的坟墓。原子讹诈政策分明已经破了产，最愚蠢的杜勒斯们却还徘徊在战争的边缘；然而最无情的是已经有了洲际弹道火箭，苏联的两个巨大的人造卫星提前飞上了天。苏联的今天就是我们的明天，我们要加紧地赶，加紧地赶，加紧地赶！最可爱的人，你们是党所领导的伟大的促进派，我们以全国的生产大跃进欢迎你们回来！让我们鼓足干劲，一同向地球开战，先打破地球的表层，然后再征服外层空间。我们要反浪费、反保守，比先进、比干劲，争取六万万人民都成为又红又专，首先要苦干十年、十五年、二十年，我们要把帝国主义者远远丢在后面。中国一定要成为社会主义的工业国，全世界的持久和平一定要实现。
