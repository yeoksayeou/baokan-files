In the cold of winter, we joined the stream of people visiting the ever-green Anquan Agricultural Cooperative in Suining County, Jiangsu Province, a place much lauded by the people.

Stepping onto the land of the Anquan Cooperative, we felt as if we were entering a dense forest. Along the cooperative's boundaries, trees formed a veritable square city. Both sides of the dike roads were lined with newly planted belts of trees, and the areas in front of villages and behind houses were centers of greenery. Even the graveyards were hidden among the aged pines and cypresses, and the ponds were enveloped by dense branches.

To see such a sight in the dead of winter was already a miracle. But hearing the cooperative's tree planting figures made us even more pleasantly surprised. Cooperative Director Shi Yongtao introduced: "We are an ever-green agricultural cooperative, beautiful in winter, even more beautiful in spring. Our cooperative has only 618 people, yet we have planted 113,863 trees, an average of 862 trees per household and more than 180 trees per person. Among them, over 70,000 trees are collectively owned, and 43,433 trees are privately owned by cooperative members."

Starting from the Ditch Sides

Cooperative Director Shi Yongtao told us, "Achieving these results was not all smooth sailing. We encountered a lot of ideological resistance at the beginning. The then Deputy Cooperative Director Song Yougui firmly disagreed with planting trees. He said, 'What's the use of planting trees? They can't be eaten!' He also said, 'Trees will block the sun and affect crop growth.' In 1956, after the National Agricultural Development Outline (Draft) was published, the state called on us to green the land. We are Party members, and we must respond. So, Shi Yongxin, Wang Cuncai, and a few others and I took the lead and started planting. We didn't have seedlings, so we contributed our own seedlings to the cooperative. Afraid that the trees would shade the farmland, we started from the Liangxi Ditch. When others were unwilling to do it, we did it ourselves. As a result..." He pointed to two rows of trees, more than ten feet tall and as thick as large bowls, and said, "We greened the three-mile-long Liangxi Ditch. At the same time, we also publicized the benefits of greening to the masses and explained how to avoid the shade of the trees from affecting the land. This is how we got many people to follow suit."

"After the tree planting campaign began, we found that there were still many people who verbally agreed that planting trees was good but didn't take action. Why? After understanding, we found that these people were afraid that planting trees would be turned over to the public and they wouldn't get any benefits. The cooperative committee studied these policy issues and announced to everyone: trees planted on private plots belong to the individuals, planting trees for the cooperative is credited with work points, and tree seedlings given to the cooperative are reimbursed. As a result, a high tide of tree planting developed, and the cooperative's surroundings and several large dikes were quickly greened, forming today's tree-lined square city. Then, we greened the 'four sides' of the cooperative. In the past two years, we have planted 70,000 trees on dikes and roadsides, more than 36,000 trees in front of villages and behind houses, and 7,800 trees on graveyards and ditch sides."

Layered Intensive Planting

From Liangxi Ditch to the cooperative office is the Anzhong Road, nearly two li long. There are two rows of trees on each side of the road. Each row has five varieties of trees. The more than ten-foot-tall Lombardy poplars stand tall in mid-air, and the cold wind whistles through them. Shorter than the Lombardy poplars is a row of weeping willows, more than seven feet tall. The branches of the weeping willows brush against the tops of the verdant pines and cypresses. Beneath the bushy tops of the pines and cypresses is a row of shrub mulberries, more than three feet tall. At the very bottom is a row of small trees less than a foot tall. These trees are planted together, and although the distance between the plants is only two feet, because the tree crowns grow in layers, they occupy their own space in an orderly manner and do not interfere with each other. Looking into the distance, they resemble two multi-layered tree archways, or a green forest alley. Interplanting five kinds of trees is called the "layered intensive planting method." Shi Yongxin told us that after they worked out this method, they greatly improved the utilization rate of the land. The cooperative has an average of only two mu of land per person, and there are no barren hills, river beaches, wastelands, or cemeteries. If they hadn't used this method, they would only have been able to plant 30,000 trees. Using this method, they planted more than 110,000 trees.

Leaving Anzhong Road, we arrived at Andong Road. This is a dike along a branch canal. There are also two rows of trees on both sides of the dike. Each row has Lombardy poplars, mulberry trees, and purple osier interplanted. The Liangxi Ditch on the west side is interplanted with pine trees and willow trees. The dikes on the south and north sides have pine trees and mulberry trees growing alternately. Each roadside is also greened using this method.

Nurturing Seedlings Under Trees

Cooperative Director and Shi Yongxin, took us to visit their nursery. Pine seedlings and mulberry seedlings grow on the more than two mu of nursery area. We asked: Can one cooperative use up so many seedlings? Shi Yongxin said excitedly: We can't use them all, we have to sell some to support fraternal cooperatives. In the past two years, we have sold 130,000 seedlings, and we have also helped green the county's Martyrs' Park and unnamed barren mountains. One hundred and thirty thousand trees, this is an amazing number, we didn't understand how two mu of nursery could produce so many tree seedlings. Another old cooperative member, Shi Xizhou, pointed to the seedlings under the rows of trees and said: It's not enough to rely on a contiguous nursery, we also have such a nursery. At this time, we noticed that there were many densely planted seedlings under the big trees.

We had never seen seedlings grown under large trees before. We all asked, how can the seedlings compete with the big trees in absorbing nutrients?

Old farmer Shi Xiyu explained from the side: "There's no need to worry about that. The big trees have deep roots and high trunks, and the seedlings have shallow roots and low trunks. They don't affect each other when absorbing water, nutrients, and sunlight." The fact that the seedlings were growing very vigorously made us believe that his explanation was correct. The masters call this seedling-raising method the "seedling-raising under trees method."

The Great Benefits of Greening

Another thing that surprised us was that we didn't see a single damaged seedling, and all the trees, big and small, were trimmed very neatly. After inquiring, we learned that they had established a forest protection covenant and also set up a forest protection team.

Why can the cooperative members be so conscious? Shi Yongxin said: Because everyone believes in the benefits of greening. Take me, for example. In the past, my family of twelve only cultivated sixteen mu of land. We didn't have enough grain to eat, and we relied on selling trees to buy grain. Not long ago, my family built thirteen houses one after another, all using our own timber. Take raising seedlings, for example, this can also greatly increase income. In 1957, my family earned 50 yuan just from selling seedlings. He also pointed to a pile of leaves and said that it provides us with grass for burning and raw materials for composting fertilizer. The cooperative director added: More importantly, it can support national construction and increase sideline income, protect crops, conserve water and soil, planting mulberry trees can also raise silkworms, and wicker can be woven into baskets. During the famine in 1956, 50% of the people in our county needed relief, but our cooperative didn't ask the state for a single cent.

As we were about to leave the Anquan Cooperative, we encountered several old men inserting paper flags in front. Then someone was digging pits to plant trees where the flags were inserted. We asked him with a smile: "How many more can you plant this year?" He said with great certainty: "70,000 trees. Reaching 300 trees per person. Each household will also have ten fruit trees."

    没有荒山废地也能大量种树
    ——参观江苏睢宁县安全社四旁绿化
    赤布　韩泽　陈哲
    在寒冬腊月里，我们随着前往参观的人流，来到了人们赞扬的四季常青的江苏睢宁县安全农业社。
    踏上安全社的土地，我们就像进入了浓密的树林。沿着社界，树木恰恰构成了一座方城。圩堤道路两旁都是新生的林带，庄前宅后都是绿树的中心。坟茔都隐蔽在苍松翠柏里，池塘被笼罩在茂密的枝干下。
    正当数九的腊月天，人们能看到这样的景象，已经是奇迹了。可是听了全社的植树数字，就使我们更加惊喜。社主任史永涛介绍说：我们是一个四季常青的农业社，冬天美，春天比现在更美。全社只有六百一十八人，已植树十一万三千八百六十三棵，平均每户八百六十二棵，平均每人一百八十多棵。其中公有树七万余棵，社员私有树四万三千四百三十三棵。
    先从沟旁开始
    社主任史永涛告诉我们说：“获得这些成绩并不是一帆风顺的。一开头碰到了许多思想阻力。当时的副社长宋有贵坚决不同意植树，他说：‘栽树有什么用，又不能当饭吃！’还说：‘树会遮住太阳，影响庄稼生长。’1956年，农业发展纲要（草案）公布后，国家号召我们绿化。我们是党员，一定要响应。于是我和史永信、王存才等几个人就带头先干起来。没有树苗，我们把自己的树苗投入社里。怕树遮农田，我们就从梁西沟开始。别人不肯干，我们就自己来。结果，……”他指着一丈多高、大碗口粗的两行树木说：“就绿化了三里长的梁西沟。同时，我们又向群众宣传绿化的好处，讲解避免树荫遮地的方法。就这样使不少人跟着干起来了。”
      “植树运动开始后，发现还有很多人嘴说栽树好，可是不行动。什么道理呢？一了解，原来这些人是怕栽树归公，自己得不到好处。社委会研究了这些政策问题，就向大家宣布：自留田栽树归自己，给社里栽树记工分，投给社里的树苗给苗钱。这样一来，栽树高潮就开展了，很快就把社的四旁几条大圩绿化起来。形成了今天的树木方城。接着，就绿化社里的‘四旁’。两年来，已在圩堤、路边植树七万棵，在庄前宅后植树三万六千多棵，在坟滩沟边植树七千八百棵。”
        分层密植
    从梁西沟到社房去，是一条安中路。安中路长度近两华里。路的两旁各有一行树。每行树的品种都是五种，一丈多高的钻天杨耸立在半空中，寒风吹来响声飕飕；比钻天杨较矮的一排是七尺多高的垂杨柳；垂杨柳下面的枝条拂打着碧绿的松柏顶端；松柏的蓬头下面还有一排三尺多高的乔木桑；最下边还有一排高不足尺的小树。这些树间植在一起，株距虽然只有二尺，但因为树头是分层生长，都很有秩序地占据着自己空间，互不打搅。向深远处望去，像是两条多层的树木牌楼，又像一条绿色的森林胡同。五种树木交叉间植，叫做“分层密植法”。史永信告诉我们，他们摸索出这种方法以后，大大地提高土地利用率。全社平均每人只有二亩地，又没有荒山、河滩、废地和义冡，如果不用这种方法，只能植树三万棵。采用这种办法他们就植树十一万多棵。
    走出安中路，我们来到了安东路。这是一条支渠的圩堤。圩堤的两边也有两行树。每一行都是钻天杨、桑树和紫穗槐三者间植。西边的梁西沟是松树和柳树间植。南边北边的圩埂是松树和桑树交叉生长。每条路边也是采用这样的方法绿化的。
      树下育苗
    社主任和史永信，带着我们参观了他们的苗圃。在二亩多面积的苗圃上，长着松苗和桑苗。我们问：这样多的苗一个社能用得完吗？史永信兴奋的说：“用不完，要卖出一部分支援兄弟社。两年来，已经卖出苗子十三万棵，还帮助绿化了本县烈士公园和无名荒山。十三万棵，这是一个惊人的数字，我们不明白两亩苗圃怎么能出产这样多的树苗。另一个老社员史希洲指着树行下边的树苗说：光靠成片的苗圃不行，我们还有这样的苗圃。这时我们才注意到大树底下还有许多种植很密的树苗。
    在大树底下育苗，我们都还是头一回看见。我们都问，在吸收养料方面，树苗怎么能争夺过大树呢？
    老农史希雨在一旁解释说：“这用不着烦神。大树根深干高，树苗根浅干低，它们在吸收水份、养料和阳光时，是互不影响的。”树苗长得非常茁壮的事实，使我们相信他的解释是正确的。主人们把这种育苗方法，叫做“树下育苗法”。
      绿化好处大
    使我们奇怪的另一点是没看到一棵被损伤的树苗，不管大树小树全部修理得很整齐。一打听，才知道，他们已经订了护林公约，还成立了护林小组。
    社员们为什么能这样自觉呢？史永信说：因为大家相信了绿化的好处。拿我来说，我家过去十二口人只种十六亩地，粮食不够吃，全靠卖树买粮食。不久前我家先后盖过十三间房子，全是用自家的木料。再如育苗吧，这也能大大增加收入。1957年光卖树苗一项我家得五十元。他还指着一堆树叶说，靠它就使我们有草烧，有了沤肥的原料。社主任补充说：更重要的是能支援国家建设和增加副业收入，可以保护农作物，可以保持水土，栽桑还可以养蚕，腊条可以编筐。1956年灾荒时我们全县50％的人要救济，我们社没向国家要一个钱。
    当我们快要离开安全社的时候，碰到几个老大爷正在前边插纸旗。随后有人在插旗的地方刨坑栽树。我们笑着问他：“今年还能栽多少呢？”他很有把握地说：“七万棵。达到每人三百棵。每户还要有十棵果木树。”
