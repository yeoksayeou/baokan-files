Xinhua News Agency, Ruijin, March 17th. A work observation and learning meeting of the Communist Youth League (CYL) of one hundred counties jointly convened by the CYL provincial committees of Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces, began on the 15th in Ruijin, Jiangxi. Attending the meeting were Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the CYL Central Committee, the CYL provincial secretaries of the four provinces, the CYL county secretaries of one hundred counties, and some grassroots CYL cadres, totaling more than 150 people.

Before the speeches at the general meeting, Hu Yaobang elaborated on the significance and purpose of this work observation and learning meeting at the meeting on the 16th. He said that it is the first time for our CYL to hold a work observation and learning meeting of one hundred counties from four provinces. We often say that we must learn in "doing," which is nothing more than three points: First, learn from the Party, study the Party's policies and instructions; second, learn from below, go deep into the grassroots, conduct investigations and research, find advanced examples, find experiences, seize typical examples, and promote them; third, learn from neighbors, exchange experiences with brother provinces and counties, learn from each other's strengths, overcome weaknesses, and learn from each other. This observation and learning meeting, which advocates learning from each other, is very meaningful, and it will be of great benefit to further promote the work of the CYL in the Great Leap Forward. Hu Yaobang also said that it is good to choose Ruijin for this meeting. Ruijin was where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao were located after 1930. We should inherit the revolutionary predecessors' tradition of hard struggle and learn from the revolutionary predecessors' revolutionary drive to better build our country.

On the 15th, the cadres attending this observation and learning meeting and more than 2,000 young people from Ruijin County went to Shazhouba, where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao lived, to build the "Hundred Counties Forest," and participated in road construction labor.

    交流经验　取长补短　相互学习
    四省团干部集会观摩工作
    据新华社瑞金17日电　由共青团江西、湖南、福建、广东四省省委联合召开的一百个县共青团工作观摩学习会，15日开始在江西瑞金举行。参加这个会的有团中央第一书记胡耀邦，四个省的团省委书记、一百个县的团县委书记和部分团的基层干部共一百五十多人。
    在大会发言之前，胡耀邦在16日的会议上阐述了这次观摩学习会的意义和目的。他说，四个省召开的一百个县共青团工作观摩学习会，对我们团来说还是第一次。我们常常说，要在“干”中学习，不外三条：一是向党学习，研究党的政策和指示；二是向下学习，深入基层，调查研究，找先进，找经验，抓住典型，加以推广；三是向友邻学习，兄弟省、县之间，互相交流经验，取长补短，相互学习。这个观摩学习会，提倡互相学习很有意义，这对在跃进中团的工作继续向前推进，大有好处。胡耀邦又说，这次会议选择在瑞金开很好。瑞金是1930年后党中央和毛主席所在的地方，我们应该继承革命先辈们的艰苦奋斗的传统，学习革命先辈们的革命干劲，更好地建设我们的国家。
    15日，参加这次观摩学习会的干部和瑞金县青年二千多人，到党中央和毛主席住过的沙洲坝营造了“百县林”；参加了修公路劳动。
