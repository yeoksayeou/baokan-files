Actively Organize New Balance
Chen Zhiyan

Chairman Mao taught us: Balance is temporary and relative, while imbalance is constant and absolute. This means that we should observe problems with a dialectical viewpoint, and not be alarmed when the old balance is disrupted. Because things are always changing and progressing in the development of contradictions, and imbalance is a sign of this change and progress. The passive balance of staying put and not moving, on the other hand, is a sign of stagnation and slowness. For example, in the past, some comrades described the revolutionary leap forward as "rash advance," mainly because these comrades were alarmed by some imbalances in life. As soon as they heard that a certain aspect was strained, they thought they were running too fast. In their view, stability, calmness, and balance everywhere are normal phenomena. From an ideological point of view, this is conservatism. From a methodological point of view, there is a lack of dialectics and too much metaphysics.

However, the dialectical view of balance and imbalance does not mean that the more acute the contradiction, the better, the greater the imbalance, the better, the longer the better. Nor does it mean that no measures need to be taken to overcome the contradiction. Contradictions are objectively present, and people's subjective will cannot prevent the occurrence of contradictions. But the possibility of overcoming contradictions and achieving unity is also objectively present. The question is how people recognize and identify this objective possibility.

In the nationwide Great Leap Forward in production and the Great Leap Forward in culture, various new imbalances are likely to occur, and have in fact already occurred. This is mentioned in the article "New Contradictions and New Balance" published in today's newspaper. The correct attitude towards this imbalance is, first, not to be afraid, only without fear can we muster enthusiasm. Second, it is necessary to actively take measures to organize a new balance. The driving force for the progress of things is the mutual struggle of opposites. The unity of opposites, on the other hand, marks the development of things to a new height. Therefore, only by actively organizing a new balance can we comprehensively achieve the targets of the Great Leap Forward. Of course, this balance will be impacted again in the future, imbalances will occur again, and measures will have to be continuously taken to establish a new balance. This is precisely the sign of the prosperity of our cause. We must build socialism and move towards communism in this constant tense struggle.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has closely noted some of the contradictions, large and small, in the Shanghai industrial leap forward, and is taking measures to overcome these contradictions and actively organize a new balance on a new basis. This can be used as a reference for other industrial cities, so that our anti-conservative Great Leap Forward targets have various measures as a guarantee, and will not be reduced to merely heroic rhetoric.

    积极组织新的平衡
    陈之衍
    毛主席教导我们：平衡是暂时的、相对的，而不平衡则是经常的，绝对的。这就是说，我们应当用辩证的观点来观察问题，不要因为旧的平衡受到冲击而心惊胆跳。因为事物总是在矛盾的发展中变化、前进的，不平衡正是这种变化、前进的征象。而那种死守原地不动的消极的平衡，却是停滞、缓慢的征象。比如，以前有一个时期有些同志把革命的跃进说成是“冒进”，其主要原因就是这些同志看到生活中发生一些不平衡的现象，就大惊小怪。一听说某某方面紧张，就认为跑得太快了。在他们看来，平平稳稳，无风无浪，处处平衡，才是正常现象。从思想根源上说，这是保守思想。而从思想方法上说，是缺少一点辩证法，多了一点形而上学。
    然而对于平衡和不平衡的辩证观点，并不等于说：矛盾越尖锐越好，不平衡越大越好，越长越好。更不等于说，不需要采取措施来克服矛盾。矛盾是客观存在，人们的主观意志不能阻止矛盾的发生。但克服矛盾使矛盾达到统一的可能性也是客观存在。问题在于人们如何认识、鉴别这种客观可能性。
    在全国生产大跃进和文化大跃进中，很可能出现各种新的不平衡，事实上已经出现。今天本报发表的“新的矛盾和新的平衡”一文中已经提到。对于这种不平衡的正确态度，一是不怕，只有不怕才能鼓起干劲。二是要积极采取措施组织新的平衡。事物前进的动力，是对立面的相互斗争。而对立面的一致，则标志着事物的发展达到新的高度。因此只有积极组织新的平衡，才能全面达到大跃进的指标。当然这种平衡以后还会受到冲击，还会发生不平衡，还要不断地采取措施来树立新的平衡。这正是我们事业兴旺的标志。我们就是要在这种不断的紧张斗争中，把社会主义建成，一直走向共产主义。
    中共上海市委已经密切注意到上海工业大跃进中一些大大小小的矛盾，而且正在采取措施克服这些矛盾，在新的基础上积极组织新的平衡。这一点可供其它工业城市参考，使我们的反保守大跃进的指标有各种措施作保证，而不至流于只是英雄的豪语。
