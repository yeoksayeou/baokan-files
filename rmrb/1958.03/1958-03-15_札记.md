    Jottings
    Please, Sir, Hurry Up
    At a press conference on March 13, Dulles publicly stated that regarding the question of whether the Indonesian rebel "government" could be recognized as a "belligerent government," he believed that "there are some standards in international law." Dulles even "recommended himself," shamelessly saying, "I have always considered myself at least a fairly good international lawyer, only I have become a bit rusty in recent years."
    Since the likes of Husein and Sjafruddin created a rebel "government" in Padang, no international lawyer in the world has been heard to be willing to defend this group of national scum. But now, Dulles does not hesitate to come out and do this in the capacity of the U.S. Secretary of State. His purpose is obviously to give political support to this rebel group when it is on the verge of its demise. In fact, if Dulles is really not afraid of losing face, he might as well brush up on his international law, which he has become a bit rusty in recent years, so that he can simply go to Padang to serve as a legal advisor to the likes of Husein. However, he needs to hurry, or it will be too late.
    No Choice
    At a press conference held in Manila, Dulles admitted on the one hand that the Manila Conference had discussed the situation in Indonesia, but on the other hand, he pretended to say: "I do not believe that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has any authority to interfere in Indonesian affairs."
    Is it really as Dulles said, that the U.S.-controlled Southeast Asia aggressive bloc does not want to interfere in the situation in Indonesia? Unfortunately, that is not the case. Philippine Foreign Minister Serrano stated that the Manila Conference would probably include the Indonesian issue in the conference communique. According to a report by the United Press, it was only because some people worried that open intervention might "do more harm than good" that they had no choice but to delete it.
    Obviously, because the Indonesian government has taken a firm attitude towards foreign interference, and public opinion in Asian countries has strongly criticized the eager ambitions of the interferers, they have had to withdraw their hands that were ready to reach out openly.
    The Reason is There
    The White House announced on the 13th that British Prime Minister Macmillan and U.S. President Eisenhower will meet in Washington on June 9th and 10th. Senior officials in Washington revealed that this meeting is a strategy meeting before the summit meeting. Therefore, Western news agencies immediately asserted: It now appears that the summit meeting will probably be held in late summer this year.
    Western countries, especially the United States, have repeatedly delayed the holding of the summit meeting. Their main excuse is to make full preparations for the meeting. It can now be seen that they are not preparing for how to hold the summit meeting well, but for how to formulate strategies to deal with the summit meeting.
    The people of all countries have been calling for the summit meeting for a long time, but the United States and Britain are still leisurely planning to discuss strategies to deal with the meeting three months later. From this, people can also see where the reason for the failure to convene the summit meeting at an early date lies.

    札记
    请君趁早
    在3月13日的一次记者招待会上，杜勒斯公然说，关于印度尼西亚叛乱“政府”是否可以被承认为“交战政府”问题，他认为“在国际法中是有一些标准的”。杜勒斯并且“毛遂自荐”，大言不惭地说：“我总是认为我自己至少是一个相当好的国际法学家，只是几年以来我有些生疏了。”
    自从侯赛尼、沙弗鲁丁之流在巴东制造叛乱“政府”以来，还不曾听说世界上有任何国际法学家愿意替这群民族败类进行辩护。可是现在，杜勒斯却不惜以美国国务卿的身份出来做这件事了。他的目的显然是想在这个叛乱集团已临末日的时候，给他们政治上的支持。其实，杜勒斯如果真的不怕失掉身份的话，倒是不妨把他几年以来有些生疏了的国际法学温习一下，那就可以索性到巴东去充当侯赛尼之流的法律顾问。不过，要抓紧时间，否则可就来不及了。
    不得已
    杜勒斯在马尼拉举行的记者招待会上一方面承认马尼拉会议对印度尼西亚的局势进行了讨论，但另一方面又装模作样地表示：“我并不认为，东南亚条约组织有干预印度尼西亚事务的任何职权”。
    事情果真是像杜勒斯所说的那样，美国操纵的东南亚侵略集团不想干预印度尼西亚的局势吗？可惜，并不是那样。菲律宾外长塞兰诺就曾表示，马尼拉会议大概要把印度尼西亚问题列入会议公报。据合众社透露说，只是因为有些人担心公开干涉可能“害多利少”，所以只好无可奈何地删去了。
    很显然，由于印度尼西亚政府对外国的干涉采取了坚定的态度，亚洲各国舆论对于干涉者的跃跃欲试的野心进行了有力的抨击，所以它们才不得不把它们准备公开伸出的手又缩了回去。
    原因在那里
    白宫13日宣布：英国首相麦克米伦和美国总统艾森豪威尔将在6月9、10两日在华盛顿会晤。华盛顿的高级官员透露说，这次会议是作为最高级会议举行之前的一次策略会议。因此，西方通讯社立即断言：现在看来，最高级会议大概将在今年夏末举行。
    西方国家，特别是美国，对最高级会议的召开一拖再拖，它们主要的借口就是要为这个会议作充分的准备。现在可以看出，它们并不是要为怎样开好最高级会议作准备，而是要为怎样制定对付最高级会议的策略作准备。
    各国人民对最高级会议已是千呼万唤，而美国和英国却还在慢条斯理地要在三个月之后去商讨对付这个会议的策略。从这里，人们也可以看出，最高级会议所以不能早日召开的原因究竟在那里。
