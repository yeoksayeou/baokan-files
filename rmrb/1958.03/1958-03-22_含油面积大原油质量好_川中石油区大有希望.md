With Large Oil-Bearing Area and Good Crude Oil Quality
    Central Sichuan Oil Region Holds Great Promise

Chengdu, March 21st (reported by this newspaper) - The Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau, following instructions from higher authorities, will further ascertain the recoverable oil-bearing area and oil reserves of the Nanchong, Longnüsi, and Penglai geological structures this year. Currently, the bureau has formulated specific plans to accelerate drilling in the central Sichuan oil region.

From March 10th to 14th, two exploratory wells on the Nanchong and Longnüsi structures, spanning Wusheng and Yuechi counties, gushed large quantities of oil. Following this, from March 16th to 17th, an exploratory well on the Penglai Town structure in Pengxi County gushed 193 tons of natural crude oil six times in fifteen hours. These three structures form a triangular zone of several thousand square kilometers, proving that the central Sichuan region is another oil region with a large oil-bearing area in our country.

This oil region has a large area; according to preliminary analysis of oil samples, the crude oil quality is very good, with relatively low sulfur, gum, asphalt, and acid content. Longnüsi Well No. 2 can refine 21.7 tons of gasoline per 100 tons of crude oil; Penglai Town Well No. 1 can refine 37.6 tons of gasoline per 100 tons. Quickly ascertaining its recoverable oil-bearing area and developing it is of great significance for promoting the development of China's petroleum industry.

In order to ascertain the oil reserves of these three structures this year for rapid development, the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau has decided to add 86 deep wells this year in addition to the existing eight deep wells on these three structures. Since the Dachen area in the northwest of Nanchong County, the Lichang area in the southwest of Nanchong County, the Shuikouchang area in Qu County, and Guang'an and other places with similar geological structures nearby also hold great promise for oil reserves, it has been decided to deploy three deep wells in each of these structures. The shallow oil layers in many areas where oil production was previously small but of industrial value will be explored with 291 new shallow wells this year to determine reserves. According to this plan, the deep well drilling task on the Nanchong, Longnüsi, and Penglai structures alone has increased by about ten times compared to the original plan.

### 含油面积大原油质量好  川中石油区大有希望

    含油面积大原油质量好
    川中石油区大有希望
    本报成都21日电  四川石油勘探局根据上级指示，要在今年内进一步查明南充、龙女寺和蓬莱三个地质构造的可采储油面积和石油储量。现在，这个局已经制订出加速钻探川中油区的具体规划。
    3月10日到14日，南充和横跨武胜、岳池两县的龙女寺构造上两口探井喷出了大量石油，紧接着，在3月16日到17日，蓬溪县蓬莱镇构造上又有一口探井先后六次在十五小时内喷出了一百九十三吨天然石油。这三个构造组成了一个数千平方公里的三角地带，证明川中地区是我国又一个含油面积很大的油区。
    这个油区，面积很大；根据油样初步分析，原油质量很好，含硫、胶、沥青和酸比较少。龙女寺二号井每一百吨原油可炼汽油二十一点七吨；蓬莱镇一号井每百吨可炼汽油三十七点六吨。迅速查明它的可采储油面积，进行开发，对促进我国石油工业的发展有重要意义。
    为了在今年查明这三个构造的石油储量，以便迅速开发，四川石油勘探局决定在这三个构造上原有的八口深井之外，今年再增加八十六口深井。由于附近地质构造相同的南充县西北的大城、南充县西南的一立场、渠县的水口场和广安等地也有很大储油希望，决定在这些构造上也各布置三口深井。过去出油量较小，但是具有工业价值的许多地区的浅油层，今年还要新开二百九十一口浅井来勘探储量。按照这一规划，仅南充、龙女寺和蓬莱三个构造上的深井钻探任务，就比原计划增大了十倍左右。
