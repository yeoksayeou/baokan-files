Give our hearts to the Party
Ye Shengtao
Give our hearts to the Party, Ye Shengtao
Give our hearts to the Party, give our hearts to the Party.
We six hundred million people, the greatest symphony orchestra,
We play the socialist march, wholeheartedly focusing on the orchestra conductor.
Give our hearts to the Party, give our hearts to the Party.
Pulse, soul, closely connected to the orchestra conductor,
Blowing, plucking, knocking, striking, responding to the baton in his hand.
Horns, trumpets, pipes, flutes, gongs, drums, pianos, harps, violins, cellos...
All must be perfectly in sync, emitting the most beautiful sounds,
And also be harmonious with each other, expressing the spirit of the entire movement.
Some are melodious and gentle, others are passionate and surging,
Sometimes solo, sometimes in unison, this is called "Let a hundred schools of thought contend."
If we compare the various musical tones to flowers,
The colors and postures are all different,
Listening and listening, it's as if we see a myriad of purples and reds,
This is called "Let a hundred flowers bloom."
But "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" is for playing the entire movement,
Just as "Let a hundred flowers bloom" is for forming a spring sunshine.
Give our hearts to the Party, give our hearts to the Party.

    把心交给党
    叶圣陶把心交给党叶圣陶把心交给党，把心交给党。我们六万万人，最伟大的交响乐队，我们演奏社会主义进行曲，全神贯注地心向乐队指挥。把心交给党，把心交给党。脉搏，心灵，跟乐队指挥息息相通，吹，弹，敲，打，应着他手里的指挥棒。号角，喇叭，管，笛，锣，鼓，钢琴，竖琴，小提琴，大提琴……全要丝丝入扣，发出最美妙的声音，还要彼此和谐，表现全部乐章的精神。这几件悠扬宛转，那几件激越奔腾，一会儿独响，一会儿齐声，这就叫“百家争鸣”。如果拿花儿来比各种乐音，色彩和姿态全不一样，听呀听呀仿佛看见万紫千红，这就叫“百花齐放”。但是“百家争鸣”为了演奏全部乐章，好比“百花齐放”为了组成一片春阳。把心交给党，把心交给党。
