Semi-Farming and Semi-Study, Improve Culture, Promote Production
Agricultural Middle Schools are Very Popular with the Masses
Farmers in Shuanglou and Shiqiao Townships in Jiangsu Province Have Established Three Schools
Editor's Note: The cadres of Shuanglou Township in Hai'an County and Shiqiao Township in Hanjiang County, Jiangsu Province, have led the masses in establishing three agricultural middle schools. This is a creative and good way to help the vast number of rural youths improve their cultural and scientific knowledge and serve the great leap forward in agricultural production. The great development of agricultural production urgently requires cultural and scientific technology to serve it; at the same time, there are a large number of senior primary school graduates and educated youths in rural areas who also want to go to school. The establishment of agricultural middle schools has found a way to solve these problems. Running such schools in rural areas does not require much money. Students can engage in semi-farming and semi-study; spend less money, study, and combine learning with practical production. The agricultural scientific and technological knowledge they learn can be immediately applied to production. Therefore, such schools are very popular with farmers.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: Farmers in Shuanglou Township, Hai'an County, and Shiqiao Township, Hanjiang County, Jiangsu Province, have established agricultural middle schools respectively, enrolling senior primary school graduates who participate in agricultural production and implementing a semi-work and semi-study system.

These agricultural middle schools are established according to the wishes of the students and their parents. The Shiqiao Township Party Committee held symposiums in early March with senior primary school graduates, parents, agricultural cooperative cadres, and Party branch secretaries to solicit opinions on running agricultural middle schools, which received enthusiastic approval and support from all parties. Twenty-eight agricultural cooperatives in the township decided to run two private agricultural middle schools in the south and north of the township respectively. The Shuanglou Township Party Committee and People's Committee of Hai'an County also began preparations in early March to establish a private agricultural middle school in Liujia Wuzi in the township.

The establishment of the three agricultural middle schools is simple and crude. Classrooms and teaching aids utilize existing houses and furniture in rural areas. Funding is entirely self-raised by the masses, and students also pay a certain amount of tuition each semester. Teachers are hired from local Party committee leaders, high school graduates participating in labor production, cadres sent to lower levels, and cadres from agricultural technology promotion stations. The curriculum includes four subjects: Chinese, politics, mathematics, and agricultural knowledge. In principle, the teaching materials are stipulated to be compiled by the teachers themselves according to the specific local conditions. Teachers generally do not leave production and adopt a semi-work and semi-teaching method. Full-time teachers are subsidized with a certain salary each month. Students study while farming and graduate in three years.

The private agricultural middle school in Shuanglou Township, Hai'an County, started classes on March 10th. The two private agricultural middle schools in Shiqiao Township are currently handling enrollment and are scheduled to start classes on the 15th. The establishment of these schools has been warmly welcomed by local farmers. During the preparation period of the agricultural middle school in Shuanglou Township, nearly two hundred graduates from previous senior primary schools enrolled within three days, and some accountants from agricultural cooperatives and private school teachers also enrolled. When the opening ceremony was held, farmers beat gongs and drums and carried red flags to congratulate. The original number of guests was 500, but more than 1,000 people came. Ouyang Huilin, Minister of Propaganda Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, and representatives of the Nantong Prefectural Committee and Hai'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China also rushed to participate.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: Houhe Farmers' Spare-time Middle School in Dapu Town, Yixing, Jiangsu Province, has cultivated a group of talents for socialist construction in rural areas over the years.

This farmers' middle school was established in May 1952 on the basis of a private school in a simple and crude manner. In practice, the school gradually proposed that the farmers' middle school should serve the development of socialist agricultural construction, and teaching should be combined with agricultural production. It determined that the enrollment targets were farmers who graduated from private schools and primary school graduates who were dedicated to agricultural production. Therefore, in terms of the school system and academic qualifications, it broke with convention. Production during the day, classes at night, and holidays were stipulated according to the agricultural production season. Each academic year can have about thirty-one or two weeks of classes. There are six days of classes per week, two hours a day during the busy farming season, and three hours a day during the slack season. In the general junior high school curriculum, only politics, Chinese, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and other courses are taught. In addition, emphasis is placed on practical agricultural common sense courses. For example, the school taught Chen Yongkang's advanced experience in rice, and the students used it in labor practice to improve farming techniques. Student Mao Hongcheng therefore won the title of high-yield model with a yield of 1,080 catties per mu. When swine erysipelas occurred in the cooperative, the school taught the treatment methods for swine erysipelas. Political classes use various central tasks as the content of the lectures. Therefore, students have played a backbone role in various rural movements.

The school only has a full-time Chinese teacher. The agricultural knowledge class is taught by technicians from the local agricultural technology promotion station, and the political class is taught by the person in charge of the township party committee.

By 1956, among the graduates of this school, four were directors of agricultural cooperatives, thirty-three were accountants of agricultural cooperatives, and some were accountants, county, district and township cadres, etc. The masses reflected that farmers' spare-time middle schools have four major benefits: First, it costs less money, farmers can afford it, study and work at the same time; second, it has cultivated cadres for rural areas; third, it has played a role in agricultural technical guidance; fourth, it has helped to promote the central work in rural areas.

    半耕半读　提高文化　促进生产
    农业中学很受群众欢迎
    江苏省双楼和施桥两乡农民已创办了三所
    编者按　江苏省海安县的双楼乡和邗江县施桥乡的干部领导群众办了三所农业中学，这是帮助农村广大青年提高文化科学知识，为农业生产大跃进服务的一项创造性的好办法。农业生产的大发展，迫切需要文化和科学技术为它服务；同时，目前农村又有大量的高小毕业生和知识青年也要求入学读书。农业中学的创办就为解决这些问题找到了办法。在农村办这样的学校，并不需要花多少钱，入校的学生可以半耕半读；少花钱，能读书，学习结合生产实际，学到的农业科学技术知识又立即可以用之于生产。因此，这样的学校深得农民的欢迎。
    新华社南京14日电　江苏省海安县双楼乡和邗江县施桥乡农民分别创办农业中学，招收参加农业生产的高小毕业生入学，实行半工半读。
    这些农业中学是根据学生和他们的家长的希望举办的。施桥乡党委会在3月初分别召开了高小毕业生、家长、农业社队干部、党支部书记等座谈会，征求有关办农业中学的意见，受到各方面的热烈赞成和支持。全乡二十八个农业社决定在乡的南部和北部分别举办两所民办农业中学。海安县双楼乡党委会和人民委员会也从3月初开始，筹备在乡里刘家圩子成立一所民办农业中学。
    三所农业中学的开办，都是因陋就简，教室教具是利用农村现有的房屋和家具，经费完全由群众自筹，学生每学期也交纳一定的学费。教师分别聘请当地党委负责人、参加劳动生产的高中毕业生、下放干部和农业技术推广站的干部等担任。课程设有语文、政治、数学、农业知识等四门。教材原则上规定由教师按照当地具体情况自己编写。教师一般不脱产，采取半工半教的办法，专任教师每月补助一定工薪。学生都是一面上学，一面种田，三年毕业。
    海安县双楼乡民办农业中学已在3月10日开学上课。施桥乡两所民办农业中学现在正办理招生工作，定15日开学上课。这些学校的成立，受到当地农民的热烈欢迎。双楼乡农业中学筹办期间，三天中报名入学的有历届高小毕业生近两百人，还有部分农业社、队的会计以及民校教师也报名入学。举行开学典礼时，农民们敲锣打鼓，打着红旗去祝贺，原定来宾五百人结果到了一千多人。中共江苏省委宣传部长欧阳惠林和中共南通地委、海安县委的代表，也都赶去参加。
    新华社南京14日电　江苏省宜兴大浦镇厚和农民业余中学，几年来为农村培养了一批建设社会主义人材。
    这所农民中学是1952年5 月在民校基础上因陋就简地建立起来的。学校在实践中逐步提出了农民中学应为发展社会主义农业建设服务、教学应与农业生产相结合的方针，确定了招生对象是民校毕业的农民和安心农业生产的小学毕业生。因而在学制学历方面，均打破了常规，白天生产，夜里上课，假期按农业生产季节规定。每一学年约可上课三十一、二周。每周上课六天，农忙时每天两小时，农闲时每天三小时。在一般初中课程中只上政治、语文、数学、理化、生物等课，另外着重联系实际上农业常识课。如学校教了陈永康的水稻先进经验，学生们就在劳动实践中运用它来改进耕作技术。学生毛洪成因此以亩产一千零八十斤的成绩获得了丰产模范的称号。社里发生猪丹毒病，学校就教了猪丹毒的治疗方法。政治课就以各项中心工作作为讲课内容。因此，学生在农村各项运动中都起了骨干作用。
    学校只有专职语文教师，农业知识课是请当地农业技术推广站的技术员讲授的，政治课是请乡党委负责讲授的。
    到195 6年，这个学校毕业生中担任农业社主任的有四人，担任农业社会计的有三十三人，还有担任会计、县区乡干部等。群众反映农民业余中学有四大好处：一、花钱少，农民上得起，一面读书，一面劳动；二、为农村培养了干部；三、对农业技术指导起了作用；四、对推动农村中心工作有帮助。
