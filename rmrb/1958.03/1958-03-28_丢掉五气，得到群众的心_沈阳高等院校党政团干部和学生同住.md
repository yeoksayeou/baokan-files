    Get Rid of the Five Airs and Win the Hearts of the Masses
    Party, Government, and League Cadres and Students Live Together in Shenyang Higher Education Institutions
    (Our report) Shenyang's ten higher education institutions are reforming their leadership style, and leading cadres are moving into student life. Recently, presidents, Party secretaries, League secretaries, some department heads, and mid-level cadres of various institutions have moved into student dormitories to live, eat, live, work, and live together with students, which has been warmly welcomed by the students.
    Dong Luzhan, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Russian Language College, President Chen Weifan, and the League Secretary, as well as heads of the academic affairs and general affairs departments, moved into student collective dormitories on the 24th. Students spread the news, and the corridors were filled with big-character posters of welcome. One class of students wrote: "We want to talk frankly and hand over our hearts to the Party without reservation...". Party and government leading cadres, some department heads, and 80% of the middle-level leading cadres of the Northeast University of Finance and Economics have moved into student dormitories and cook dormitories to live. The night Vice President Chen Fang moved in, students came to see him and told him about many problems in their studies and life. As soon as Qiao Zhenmin, Vice President of the Northeast Conservatory of Music, moved into the student dormitory, he did morning exercises with the students. Leading cadres of various schools generally believe that this time they have found a way to overcome the "five airs" and make a "rejuvenation" in their mental outlook, becoming a lot younger. Some people oppose the idea of leading cadres living among the masses, believing that this is formalism, and it is okay to go down for a short time, but it will be unbearable for a long time. However, most leading cadres believe that living among the masses means getting rid of the "five airs" and winning the hearts of teachers and students.

    丢掉五气，得到群众的心
    沈阳高等院校党政团干部和学生同住
    本报讯　沈阳十所高等院校革新领导作风，领导干部纷纷到学生中去安家落户。近日来，各院校的院校长、党委书记、团委书记、部分系主任和中级干部陆续搬到学生宿舍去居住，和学生同吃、同住同劳动、同生活，深受同学们的欢迎。
    俄文专科学校党委书记董鲁展、校长陈维帆和团委书记，以及教务、总务部门的负责人，在24日搬进了学生集体宿舍。同学们奔走相告，走廊上贴满了欢迎的大字报。有一个班的同学写道：“我们要坦率的谈心，决不保留地把心交给党……”。东北财经学院的党、政领导干部、部分系主任和80％的中层领导干部都搬到学生宿舍和炊事员宿舍去居住。陈放副院长刚搬去的那天晚上，学生们就来看他，向他反映了学习和生活中的许多问题。东北音乐专科学校副校长乔振民一搬到学生宿舍，便和学生一起做早操。各学校的领导干部一致认为：这回找到了克服“五气”的门路，在精神面貌方面也来一个“返老还童”，年轻不少。领导干部到群众中去住，有些人是反对的，他们认为这样做是形式主义，下去短时间还行，长了会受不了。但是大部分领导干部却认为：到群众中去住，丢掉的是“五气”，得到的是教师和学生们的心。
