Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 2nd: The cotton-producing areas of Hubei Province are vigorously promoting the experience of using nutrient pots for cotton seedlings. Macheng County will adopt the method of raising seedlings in nutrient pots and transplanting them on 30% of its cotton fields this year. In Xiaogan Prefecture, 50% of the double-cropped cotton fields (about 500,000 mu) will universally implement the method of raising seedlings in square nutrient pots and transplanting them. Other major cotton-producing counties are also learning the technology of making nutrient pots.

In order to promote the experience of using cotton nutrient pots, the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture recently held an on-site meeting in Lisheng Township, Macheng County.

In Hubei Province, 90% of the cotton fields are intercropped with wheat or other crops. Raising seedlings in nutrient pots and transplanting them involves first planting the seeds in a specially made nutrient pot. After the previous crop (wheat, rapeseed, or beans) is harvested, the cotton seedlings, along with the nutrient pot, are transplanted into the cotton field. This not only solves the conflict between double cropping and promotes cotton production, but also saves fertilizer. According to the areas that used nutrient pots in 1957, cotton grown from seedlings raised in nutrient pots and transplanted generally increased production by 10%-20% compared to direct sowing between the rows of the previous crop, and could mature ten days to half a month earlier.

The cotton nutrient pot is made by mixing well-screened topsoil with various fertilizers and an appropriate amount of water in a certain proportion to create a pot blank. Then, a pot-making device is used to make round pots about three inches high and one and a half inches in diameter (some are made into compartments and divided into squares with a planner), with a sowing eye on top. According to the experience of Hongxing No. 1 Cooperative of Lisheng Township, Macheng County: seven parts of sandy loam soil, three parts of cattle and pig manure, plus 1% superphosphate. Alternatively, ten dan of sandy loam soil mixed with one jin each of superphosphate and ammonium sulfate.

    湖北推广棉花营养钵
    可增产一二成，早熟十天到半月
    据新华社武汉2日电　湖北各棉产区正大力推广使用棉花营养钵的经验。麻城县今年将有30％的棉田采用营养钵育苗移栽办法；孝感专区今年有50％的两熟棉田（约五十万亩）要普遍推行方格营养钵育苗移栽。其他主要产棉县也正在学习制营养钵技术。
    为了推广使用棉花营养钵的经验，湖北省农业厅不久前在麻城县李胜乡举行了现场会。
    湖北省有90％的棉田是棉花与小麦或其他作物套种的。用营养钵育苗移栽，就是先把种子种在一种特制的营养钵里，待前作物（小麦或油菜、豆类）收割后，再把棉苗连营养钵移栽到棉田里。这样不仅可以解决两熟矛盾，促使棉花增产，而且还可节省肥料。据1957年使用营养钵的地区证明：用营养钵育苗移栽的棉花产量，一般要比在前作物行间直播的增产10％—20％，并且可以提早成熟十天到半月。
    棉花营养钵是用过筛后的顶好的土，按一定比例和各种肥料及适量的水拌和后做成钵坯，然后用一种制钵器制成约三寸高直径一寸半的圆形（也有制成厢子，用规划器划成方格的），上面有一播种眼。按麻城县李胜乡红星一社的经验是：油砂土七成，牛、猪粪三成再加1％的过磷酸钙。或者是十担油砂土拌和过磷酸钙、硫酸铵各一斤。
