In recent days, many soldiers from the follow-up units of the first batch of Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea, who are ready to depart, have been practicing footwork and learning marksmanship with the Korean People's Army soldiers every day. Some units have also invited Korean People's Army officers to introduce "A Day in the Life of a Company" and invited Republic Heroes from the Korean People's Army to introduce heroic deeds. A group of political workers dispatched by the leadership of a certain division is collecting examples of the Korean People's Army's internationalism and patriotism, heroic behavior, diligence, bravery, simple and arduous traditions, and combat, training, and regularization construction. They are preparing to compile a booklet titled "Learning From the Korean People's Army" to distribute to officers and soldiers for study. (Attached pictures)

    新华社平壤20日电　中国人民志愿军首批撤出朝鲜部队后续部队在归国前，广泛地展开了向英雄的朝鲜人民军学习优良传统、正规作风和各种工作经验的学习热潮。
    近几天来，整装待发的志愿军首批撤出朝鲜部队的后续部队，每天都有很多士兵跟人民军战士一起练步法、学枪法；有些单位还邀请人民军军官介绍“连队生活一日”，请人民军中的共和国英雄介绍英雄事迹。某师领导机关派出的一批政治工作人员，正在搜集有关朝鲜人民军的国际主义和爱国主义的英雄行为、勤劳勇敢、艰苦朴素的优良传统和作战、训练以及正规化建设等方面的范例，准备编印成“向朝鲜人民军学习”的小册子，发给官兵学习。（附图片）
