    "One Night Red Light"
    The Five Rams brand batteries manufactured by the Guangzhou Xinghua Factory used to be of very good quality and were very popular with the masses. However, recently they have deteriorated: the light emitted is red, and they run out of power after only one night. Therefore, the masses have given it a nickname, calling it "One Night Red Light" brand batteries. It is hoped that the Xinghua Factory workers, in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, will restore the quality of Five Rams brand batteries and regain their reputation.

    “一夜红光”
    广州兴华厂制造的五羊牌电池，以前质量很好，很受群众欢迎。可是近来变坏了：光亮发红，用不了一夜就没电了。因此，群众给它起个外号，叫“一夜红光”牌电池。希望兴华厂职工在反浪费反保守运动中，恢复五羊牌电池质量，挽回荣誉。
