    Shanghai-Nanjing Line Sets New Travel Record
    Shanghai to Nanjing: Three Hours and Fifty-Three Minutes
    (Our Shanghai dispatch) In the revolutionary Great Leap Forward of Shanghai's anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, progressing at a thousand miles a day, the Shanghai Railway Administration delivered an inspiring piece of good news on the 26th: the trial run of the direct express train from Shanghai to Nanjing was a complete success. The express train successfully arrived in Nanjing in three hours and fifty-three minutes, one hour and eight minutes ahead of the current sixth special express train's five hours and two minutes. This is the highest record in the history of direct express trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing line.
    At 9:33 a.m. on the 26th, a train departed from Shanghai Station, speeding directly towards Nanjing. The crew in charge of driving consisted of outstanding driver Zhou Guohua, who had participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, co-driver Hong Naiguang, and fireman Wang Linhuai. The weather conditions that day were not good, with a northeast wind of force five to seven along the way, and the train advanced against the wind at a speed of ninety to one hundred kilometers per hour. Everything went smoothly during the train's operation in accordance with the new technical measures. It arrived victoriously at Nanjing Station at 1:26 p.m., six minutes ahead of the recently proposed new running time of three hours and fifty-nine minutes.
    Shortening the running time of passenger trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing line and other lines under its jurisdiction is a victory in the anti-conservatism struggle recently launched by the Shanghai Railway Bureau. The Shanghai Railway Bureau has decided that from March 5th, the sixth special express train will officially run according to the new timetable.

    沪宁线创行车最高纪录
    上海—南京：三小时五十三分
    本报上海讯　在一日千里的上海反浪费、反保守的革命大跃进中，上海铁路管理局26日传出一个振奋人心的喜讯：上海到南京的直达快车的试车获得完全成功，快车以三小时五十三分的时间顺利地到达南京，比现在的六次特别快车的五小时零二分，提前了一小时零八分。这是沪宁线上直达快车的历史最高纪录。
    26日上午九时三十三分，一列火车由上海站驶出，风驰电掣般地直奔南京。担任驾驶的是由参加过抗美援朝的优秀司机周国华、副司机洪乃光、司炉王懍怀组成的机班。这一天气候条件不好，沿途有五到七级的东北风，火车以每小时九十到一百公里的速度，冲击着大风前进。火车运行中一切都按照着新的技术措施进行，沿途异常顺利，下午一时二十六分胜利到达南京站，比最近提出的三点五十九分的新运行时间，又提前了六分钟。
    缩短沪宁线客车以及所辖其他各线客车的行驶时间，是上海铁路局最近掀起的反保守斗争中的一个胜利。上海铁路局已决定从3月5日起，正式将第六次特别快车，按新时间行驶。
