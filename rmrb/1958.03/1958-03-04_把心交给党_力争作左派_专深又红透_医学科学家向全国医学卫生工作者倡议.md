Hand Our Hearts Over to the Party, Strive to Be Leftists, Be Both Expert and Profound, and Red to the Core
Medical Scientists Propose to Medical and Health Workers Nationwide

    (Reported by this newspaper) More than 130 medical scientists from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences held a rally in Beijing on March 3rd to pledge a great leap forward in medical science. They unanimously passed a proposal for "Being Both Red and Expert, Advancing Together" and challenged medical and health workers nationwide. They proposed: "Politically, strive to be leftists; in medical science work, be promoters; and in the shortest possible time, promote a great leap forward in medical science to serve socialist construction and the health of the working people." The battle slogans they put forward are: "Boost Enthusiasm, Break with Conventions; Remold Ourselves, Serve Workers and Peasants; Collective Cooperation, Technological Innovation; Both Red and Expert, Advancing Together."

    The proposals they made are: "Hand our hearts over to the Party and be determined to support the Party's leadership." Unreservedly accept the Party's leadership politically and professionally, actively respond to all the Party's calls, and resolutely implement the Party's scientific research, cadre training, and health work guidelines, policies, and plans. Politically, resolutely support the socialist system and abide by all state laws. Resolutely serve socialist construction and the health of the working people. They proposed to overcome individualism and establish collectivism. Individual interests must unconditionally submit to collective and national interests. Do not emphasize personal interests, and resolutely obey state allocation; establish correct labor and mass viewpoints, wholeheartedly serve the working people, and overcome the bourgeois ideology of underestimating the working people, being detached from production practice, and neglecting politics; strive to study Marxism-Leninism and continuously improve political and ideological levels.

    They also proposed to strengthen coordination and cooperation, concentrate efforts on key research, and strive for a great leap forward in medical science research. They suggested that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences should focus on research on eliminating the four pests and eliminating and preventing the most serious diseases that endanger people's health. Strive to reach international standards for established important research projects within five years.

    They proposed to actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries, vigorously promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and improve the level of medical science in China. While ensuring the completion of the above-mentioned key research work, they will closely cooperate with the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine to study traditional Chinese medicine using modern scientific methods, strive to promote this valuable legacy, and strive to make contributions to world medical science.

    They proposed to boost revolutionary enthusiasm, break with conventions, and achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. They will go deep into epidemic areas, into wards, and into laboratories, taking the lead by personal example. Implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in academics; they will also train a group of cadres who are both red and expert; ensure the successful completion of medical and health care work, and establish a diligent and thrifty hospital management style.

    Many medical scientists spoke at the meeting on the 3rd, expressing their determination to realize this proposal with concrete actions, and they all formulated specific personal leap forward plans. Zhang Xiaoqian, an expert in gastroenterology, said that he would go to the grassroots level to lecture at least once a year; within three years, he would basically complete the survey of the incidence of ulcer disease nationwide, summarize the clinical characteristics of the disease in China, and formulate preliminary prevention and treatment plans. Physiologist Zhang Xijun said that he would break with conventions and shorten the training period for graduate students by one year, ensuring that five qualified assistant researchers and six graduate students would be trained within five years. Jin Yinchang, a professor of pharmacology, stated that he would actively establish feelings of shared labor with the masses and actively strive for opportunities to labor together with workers, peasants, and soldiers, truly integrating with them in thought and feeling.

    把心交给党　力争作左派　专深又红透
    医学科学家向全国医学卫生工作者倡议
    本报讯　中国医学科学院一百三十多位医学科学家3日在北京举行医学科学大跃进的誓师大会，一致通过了“又红又专，双双跃进”的倡议，并且向全国医学卫生工作者挑战，他们提出：“在政治上力争做左派，在医学科学工作中做促进派，在最短时间内，促使医学科学的大跃进，为社会主义建设和劳动人民健康服务。”他们提出的战斗口号是：“鼓起干劲，打破陈规；自我改造，服务工农；集体合作，技术革新；又红又专，双双跃进”。
    他们提出的倡议是：“要把心交给党，决心拥护党的领导。”在政治上和业务上无保留地接受党的领导，积极响应党的一切号召，坚决执行党所制订的科学研究、干部培养和卫生工作的方针政策与规划。在政治上坚决拥护社会主义制度和遵守国家一切法令。坚决为社会主义建设和劳动人民的健康服务。他们提出要克服个人主义、树立集体主义。个人利益无条件服从集体利益和国家利益。不强调个人兴趣，坚决服从国家调配；树立正确的劳动观点与群众观点，全心全意为劳动人民服务，克服轻视劳动人民、脱离生产实践、忽视政治的资产阶级思想；努力学习马列主义，不断提高政治思想水平。
    他们还提出要加强协调合作，集中力量进行重点研究，争取医学科学研究工作大跃进。他们建议在第二个五年计划期间，中国医学科学院以研究除四害及消灭和防治危害人民健康最严重的疾病为重点。争取在五年内对既定的重要研究项目达到国际水平。
    他们提出积极学习苏联及其他国家的先进经验，努力发扬祖国医学遗产，提高我国医学科学水平。在保证完成上述重点研究工作的同时，他们将与中医研究院密切合作，用近代的科学方法，研究祖国医学，努力发扬这一宝贵遗产，争取对世界医学科学做出贡献。
    他们提出要鼓起革命干劲，打破陈规，作到多快好省。他们要深入疫区、深入病房、深入实验室、亲自动手，以身作则。在学术上贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针；他们还要培养一批又红又专的干部；保证做好医疗保健工作，树立勤俭办医院的作风。
    许多医学科学家在3日的会上纷纷发言，表示以具体行动实现这个倡议，他们都订出了具体的个人跃进规划。内科胃肠专家张孝骞表示每年至少去基层讲学一次；在三年内要基本上完成全国溃疡病发病率的调查，总结出该病在我国的临床特点，制订出初步的防治方案。生理学家张锡钧表示要打破陈规，缩短培养研究生期限一年，保证在五年内培养出合格的助理研究员五名，研究生六名。药理学教授金荫昌要积极建立和群众共劳动的感情，要积极争取与工农兵共同劳动的机会，真正做到在思想感情上和工农兵打成一片。
