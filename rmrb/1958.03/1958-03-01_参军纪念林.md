    Commemorative Forest for Army Recruits

    On January 30th, three hundred and forty young people from our county who were conscripted into military service all put on their uniforms. Before leaving their hometowns, County Head Li Youwen and County Military Service Bureau Chief Li Peng led them to plant trees in Wangjiagou, Sanhuang Township of this county. When planting trees, everyone competed with each other to see who could plant the trees that would grow faster and better; words don't count, we'll see when we return home after demobilization. After a period of intense labor, more than two thousand elm trees were planted, changing the face of the old gully and barren slope. Everyone called this forest the "Commemorative Forest for Army Recruits."

    参军纪念林
    1月30日，我们县应征服兵役的三百四十名青年，都穿上了军装。在离开家乡前，由县长李有温、县兵役局长李鹏带同他们在本县三皇乡王家沟植树造林。在植树时，大家互相比赛，看谁栽的树长得快，长得好；说了不算，复员回乡再看。经过一番紧张劳动，共栽上了榆树两千多株，使旧沟荒坡改变了面貌。大家把这片树林叫做“参军纪念林”。
