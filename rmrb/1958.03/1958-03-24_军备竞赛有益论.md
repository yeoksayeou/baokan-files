    The Benefit of the Arms Race Theory

    British Prime Minister Macmillan stated in Parliament on the 21st that he sincerely hoped to stop the terrible arms race through universal disarmament, and the sooner the better. If the British Prime Minister truly detested the arms race as much as he said, it would not only be a blessing for the British people.

    However, Macmillan immediately explained: "It is not the arms race itself that causes war." By saying this, the arms race is not terrible at all. Moreover, from Macmillan's point of view, the arms race is not only not terrible, but also lovely, because he said: "What prevents war is the balance of power." To maintain the "balance of power," of course, one must engage in an arms race. Therefore, according to Macmillan, the arms race will not only not cause war, but also prevent war.

    Superficially expressing the hope to stop the arms race, while actually advocating the arms race, Macmillan's technique is just the general technique of warmongers that people are accustomed to seeing.

    军备竞赛有益论
    英国首相麦克米伦21日在议会中表示，他非常希望通过普遍裁军来停止可怕的军备竞赛，而且越快越好。如果英国首相对军备竞赛真是这样深恶痛绝，这就不仅是英国人民之福了。
    但是麦克米伦马上又解释道：“引起战争的并不是军备竞赛本身”。这样说，军备竞赛是并没有什么可怕的。而且从麦克米伦看来，军备竞赛不但不可怕，而且可爱，因为他说：“防止了战争的是均势”。要保持“均势”当然就得进行军备竞赛，因此，按照麦克米伦的说法，军备竞赛不但不会引起战争，而且还能防止战争。
    表面上表示希望停止军备竞赛，实际上在鼓吹军备竞赛，麦克米伦的这种手法是人们司空见惯的战争贩子的一般手法罢了。
