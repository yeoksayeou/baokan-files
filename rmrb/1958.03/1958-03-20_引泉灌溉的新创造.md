    New Creation in Diverting Spring Water for Irrigation
    In Baisha Township, Yichuan County, Henan Province, a mountain spring with a flow rate of 0.15 cubic meters per second has been used to develop more than 40,000 mu of irrigated land. This greatly breaks the old convention that one flow rate can only irrigate 20,000 mu of land. Their method is to build a 40-li long canal, with 56 small reservoirs built on both sides, diverting spring water into the canal, which connects to the reservoirs, forming a water storage and irrigation network. The reservoirs are constantly kept filled. This creation points to a new direction for improving water utilization. (Yuan)

    引泉灌溉的新创造
    河南伊川县白沙乡引出一股零点一五秒公方流量的山泉，却发展了四万多亩水浇地，这就大大突破了一般人认为一个流量只能浇两万亩地的陈规。他们用的办法是修一条四十多里长的水渠，两侧再修筑五十六个小水库，引泉水入渠，渠通水库，形成蓄水灌溉网。经常保持水库的储水量。这一创造为提高水量利用指出了新的方向。（袁）
