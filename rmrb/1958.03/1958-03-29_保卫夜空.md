Defend the Night Sky

    The Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army defends the motherland's airspace day and night. Whether it's a windy night or a rainy night, they are always on duty, ready to strike at any air pirates who dare to invade. Powerful aircraft formations, anti-aircraft guns... a net of justice has been laid everywhere. If the enemy dares to invade, we will surely wipe them out! (With pictures)
