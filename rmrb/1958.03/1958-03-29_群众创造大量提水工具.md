    Masses Create a Large Number of Water Lifting Tools
    In Changge County, Henan Province, the task of lifting water for irrigation was very urgent. If all 7,000 liberation-style waterwheels in the county were put into use, requiring 54% of the labor force every day, it would still take 40 to 50 days to irrigate all 820,000 mu of wheat in the county. After the masses created more than 3,880 water lifting tools, the efficiency was greatly improved. The wheat fields in the county were irrigated in a timely manner in the first half of March.

    群众创造大量提水工具
    河南长葛县提水浇地任务很紧迫，全县七千部解放式水车如果全部使用起来，每天投入54％的劳动力，全县八十二万亩小麦也要四十天到五十天才能浇完。群众创造了三千八百八十多件提水工具以后，效率大大提高，全县的麦田在3月上半月就及时灌溉了一遍。
