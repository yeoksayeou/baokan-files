    “Radio Wave Pipe Locator”
    Wang Quanzhong, a technician from the Tianjin Water Company, has successfully trial-produced a "radio wave pipe locator" for detecting the location and depth of underground water pipes. After multiple tests, the sensitivity of this radio wave pipe locator exceeds that of imported products. Its volume and weight are half that of imported products, making it very easy to carry. Using this "radio wave pipe locator" can accurately measure the location and depth of water pipes, facilitating the repair of underground pipelines and the search for old pipelines.

    “电波寻管器”
    天津市自来水公司的技术员王权中试制成功一种探测地下水管位置和深度用的“电波寻管器”。经过多次试验，这种电波寻管器的灵敏度超过进口货。体积和体重比进口货小一半，携带起来非常轻便。使用这种“电波寻管器”可以很准确地测出水管的位置和深度，便于修理地下管道和寻找旧管道。
