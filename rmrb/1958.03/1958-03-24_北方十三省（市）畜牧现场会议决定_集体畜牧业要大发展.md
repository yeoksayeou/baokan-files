The Northern Thirteen Provinces (Cities) Animal Husbandry On-Site Meeting Decides
Collective Animal Husbandry to Develop Greatly

　　This newspaper, Xi’an, 23rd, Northern Thirteen Provinces (Cities) Animal Husbandry On-Site Meeting decided that this year, the northern provinces should transfer more than one million head of breeding livestock among themselves to promote the great development of livestock and adapt to the needs of livestock in the great leap forward in agricultural production. These breeding livestock include the famous Qinchuan cattle, Guanzhong donkey, Nanyang cattle, and Northeast and Inner Mongolia horses.
　　This meeting was hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture and held in Weinan County, a county with abundant livestock production in Shaanxi, from March 9th to 23rd. The meeting was attended by 142 people, including the directors of agriculture departments and animal husbandry bureaus of thirteen provinces (cities), namely Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangsu, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Beijing Municipality, as well as the heads of key counties for developing animal husbandry, the secretaries of the county Party committees, and the directors of agricultural cooperatives. A working group from the Second Ministry of Commerce also participated in the meeting.
　　After visiting and discussing, the representatives of various provinces unanimously agreed that Weinan's experience of adhering to relying on the masses and fully utilizing the superior conditions of cooperativization to establish and develop collective animal husbandry in agricultural cooperatives is worth learning and promoting. Weinan's experience proves that establishing and developing collective animal husbandry in agricultural cooperatives is an important way to strive for a great leap forward in animal husbandry this year. At the same time, as long as mating is carried out in batches and phases during the slack season of agriculture, according to the agricultural season and the estrus cycle of livestock, both production and reproduction can be achieved without any conflict. The meeting requested that all localities immediately seize the peak estrus season of female animals in April and carry out a concentrated mating campaign.
　　The representatives also sparked a competition upsurge of comparing advanced practices and enthusiasm through presenting the surplus and shortage of livestock. Weinan County proposed that all 16,000 breedable female animals this year should be mated, and efforts should be made to ensure that all of them survive. The six provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, and Anhui re-revised this year's livestock breeding targets, increasing them by 700,900 heads compared to the original plan; Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the six provinces of Jiangsu, Heilongjiang, etc., plan to double the number of livestock by 1962 compared to the present. The representatives of the thirteen provinces (cities) requested that 177 counties with abundant livestock production be cultivated this year, including 22 "four-full" counties with full mating, full success, full birth, and full survival.
　　In order to achieve the purpose of breeding excellent livestock, the meeting required vigorously selecting and breeding superior breeds, changing the past phenomena of inbreeding, cross-mating, and random mating, and preventing the degeneration of superior breeds. (Attached picture)

    北方十三省（市）畜牧现场会议决定
    集体畜牧业要大发展
    本报西安23日电　北方十三省（市）畜牧现场会议决定，今年北方各省要相互调剂种畜一百多万头，促进牲畜大发展，适应农业生产大跃进中对牲畜的需要。这些种畜中，包括著名的秦川牛、关中驴、南阳牛、东北和内蒙古马等。
    这个会议由农业部主持，从3月9日到23日在陕西耕畜丰产县渭南县召开。参加会议的有河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西、甘肃、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、安徽、江苏、内蒙古自治区和北京市等十三个省（市）农业厅长、畜牧局长、各省发展畜牧业的重点县长、中共县委书记、农业社主任等一百四十二人。第二商业部组成的工作组也参加了会议。
    经过参观座谈，各省代表一致认为渭南坚持依靠群众、充分利用合作化的优越条件建立发展农业社集体畜牧业的经验，值得学习和推广。渭南经验证明：建立发展农业社集体畜牧业，是争取今年畜牧工作大跃进的重要办法。同时，只要根据农业季节和牲畜发情规律，利用农闲，分期、分批配种，可以做到生产、繁殖两不误。会议要求，各地应立即抓紧4月母畜发情旺盛季节，开展突击配种。
    代表们还通过摆牲畜余缺情况，掀起比先进、比干劲的竞赛热潮。渭南县提出今年一万六千头可以配种的母畜要全部配种，争取全部成活。河北、河南、陕西、甘肃、山西、安徽六个省重新修订了今年繁殖牲畜的指标，比原计划增加七十万零九千头；内蒙古自治区和江苏、黑龙江等六省计划到1962年牲畜数量要比现在增加一倍。十三个省（市）代表要求今年培养一百七十七个牲畜丰产县，其中要有二十二个全配、全准、全生、全活的“四全”县。
    为了达到繁殖优良牲畜的目的，会议要求大力选育良种，改变过去近亲繁殖、配交、乱配的现象，防止良种退化。（附图片）
