Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th - A high-altitude garden, more than 2,300 meters above sea level, exists in the Soviet Tajik Republic. It is surrounded by barren mountains and cliffs, but in the garden area, green bushes cover the mountain paths, and apple and cherry blossoms are abundant.

This high-altitude garden grows the most valuable plants from Central Asia and the Pamirs, and also cultivates many plants from East Asia and China. Many of the East Asian plants are varieties left over from ancient times, and they have aroused great interest among botanists.

This garden is the Botanical Garden of the Tajik Academy of Sciences, located in the Pamir Mountains in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. People can see an "oasis" on the barren mountains after traveling along winding and narrow roads through many deserted and steep mountains. This is the high-altitude botanical garden. At present, the garden covers a total area of 15 hectares, and will gradually be expanded to 30 hectares in the future. Here you can see the beautiful and graceful Pamir birch, which is hard to see elsewhere, as well as poplar and willow trees. The botanical garden also grows wild grapes, walnut trees, and so on. The botanical garden uses the largest area to plant many East Asian and Chinese plants. From these plants, it can be seen that China and Tajikistan have had exchanges of crops for a long time. As early as the end of the last century, the famous Russian botanist Korzhinsky saw Chinese cherry trees in this area when he traveled in the Pamirs. Recently, the staff of the botanical garden discovered a garden in the Pamirs that was completely planted with Chinese cherry trees. In the Tajik Republic and the Pamir region, collective farms are very successfully cultivating Chinese peach, apricot, and pear trees. Ornamental plants from China are also commonly planted in Tajikistan.

Many ancient East Asian plants that grow in the botanical garden are difficult to find elsewhere in the world. Why can the East Asian region preserve so many ancient plants? The geologist's answer is: because the geological and climatic conditions in this region have changed the least. At the same time, the Pamir region can preserve plants from the East Asian region, which also shows that the Pamir region had very similar climatic conditions to East Asia at some time in ancient times.

The task of the botanical garden is to cultivate new varieties and new crops for the Pamir farms. In this regard, it has achieved remarkable results. It has helped the farms in the Pamir region to cultivate fruit trees from China very well. In recent years, the botanical garden has also helped the farms to promote Chinese quince in large quantities.

### 百花盛开绿成荫  荒山丛中有桃源  苏联一高山花园栽满奇花异草

    苏联一高山花园栽满奇花异草
    新华社莫斯科25日电　苏联塔吉克共和国境内有一个拔海两千三百公尺以上的高山花园。它的四周尽是荒山和悬崖，但是在花园一带，绿色的树丛布满山径，苹果、樱桃花枝纷繁。
    这个高山花园生长着中亚细亚和帕米尔地区各种最有价值的植物，还栽培着许多东亚和中国的植物。有许多东亚植物是古代遗留下来的品种，它们引起了植物学家的很大兴趣。
    这座花园就是塔吉克科学院的植物园，座落在戈尔诺—巴达赫尚自治州内帕米尔高原群山中间。人们沿着曲折狭小的道路穿过许多荒无人迹的深山峻岭，就可以在荒山上看见一片“绿洲”，这就是高山植物园。目前这个花园共占地十五公顷，将来要逐渐扩充到三十公顷。这里可以看到美丽挺秀的、在外边已经很难看到的帕米尔白桦，还可以看到白杨和柳树。植物园还种有野葡萄、胡桃树等等。植物园用最大的面积来种植许多东亚和中国的植物，从这些植物中可以看出，中国和塔吉克很久以来就有农作物的交流。还在上世纪末，著名的俄国植物学家科尔任斯基在帕米尔旅行的时候，就看见这个地区有中国的樱桃树。最近，植物园的工作人员在帕米尔一个地区发现了一个完全栽满了中国樱桃树的园子。在塔吉克共和国境内和帕米尔地区，集体农庄在非常成功地栽培着中国的桃树，杏树、梨树。来自中国的观赏植物也在塔吉克普遍地栽种着。
    植物园中生长的许多古代遗留下来的东亚植物，在世界其他地区已经很难找到了。为什么东亚地区能保存许多古代的植物呢？地质学家的答案是：因为这个地区的地质和气候条件变化最小。同时，帕米尔地区能够保存东亚地区的植物，这也说明帕米尔地区在古代某一时候和东亚的气候条件很相似。
    植物园的任务是给帕米尔的农庄培育新品种、新作物。在这方面，它已经获得显著的成绩。它已经帮助帕米尔地区的农庄很好地培育了来自中国的果树。最近几年来，植物园还帮助农庄大量推广中国的榅桲。
