    Xinhua News Agency special dispatch, 20th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Lei Runming reports: What should we do about the lack of manpower after the production leap forward? When the leaders of the Beijing Joint Private-Public Enterprise Iron Wire Factory were trying to solve this problem, they reached out to higher authorities for people, but the problem remained unresolved. However, the workers solved the problem by adjusting the labor force and tapping potential, increasing the factory's planned output this year by more than one and a half times compared to last year's actual output.
    The Joint Enterprise Iron Wire Factory is a small factory with rudimentary equipment and just over two hundred people. The enthusiasm of the employees is very high. From the beginning of the year to the present, the factory's annual production plan has been revised three times, from the initial 3,600 tons to 7,000 tons. During the discussion of revising the plan, after tapping the potential in equipment, operation, and other aspects, everyone believed that switching from two shifts to three shifts was the key to completing this leap forward plan.
    The factory leaders had long planned to start three-shift production, but at least thirty more workers were needed. They repeatedly requested additional workers from higher authorities, but this was not resolved. The workers repeatedly urged the leadership to start three shifts, and some even put up big-character posters saying: Start it quickly, don't just talk about it. However, the leaders did not consult with the workers, always thinking that the manpower problem could not be solved, and were constantly worried about it.
    After learning about the leaders' worries, the workers actively thought of ways to transfer people from their own workshops and groups. After research, the workers in Li Yuansen's group in the first workshop strengthened cooperation and freed up one person without affecting production at all. The fourth group of the water tank also adjusted the labor organization and decided to transfer four people from twelve. As a result, the entire workshop transferred sixteen people. The second workshop, which had already made preparations, also proposed that it could transfer ten people. Seeing the enthusiasm of the workers, the management cadres said to the factory director: "We'll cover whatever is still needed." In this way, all thirty workers needed for three-shift production were solved. The factory director and the Party branch secretary both said with emotion: If we had consulted the workers about the problem of increasing manpower earlier, wouldn't it have been solved long ago!
    After the three-shift production began, the machines ran day and night, and the output increased rapidly. Since the 9th, the average daily output of iron wire has increased by more than 30% compared to before the 8th.

    早同工人商量早就解决了
    本报特约新华社20日讯  新华社记者雷润明报道：生产跃进以后人力不够怎么办？北京公私合营企联铁丝厂在解决这个问题的时候，领导人员伸手向上级要人，问题得不到解决；工人们却用调整劳动力、挖掘潜力的办法解决了这个问题，使工厂今年的计划产量比去年实际产量提高一倍半以上。
    企联铁丝厂是一个设备简陋、仅有二百多人的小工厂。职工们的干劲十足。从年初到现在，全厂今年的产量计划已经经过三次修改，由最初的三千六百吨提高到七千吨。在讨论修改计划的过程中，大家在挖掘了设备、操作等各方面的潜力以后认为：改两班生产为三班生产，是完成这一跃进计划的关键。
    厂的领导人早就打算开三班生产，但要开三班至少要增加三十个工人。他们几次向上级提出请求增加工人，都没有得到解决。工人们屡次催领导方面开三班，有的人还贴出大字报说：要开就快开，不能说空话。可是领导方面不和工人们商量，总以为人的问题解决不了，一直在那里发愁。
    工人们知道领导的苦恼以后，都纷纷自动想办法从本车间、本小组向外调人。一车间李元森小组的工人经过研究，互相加强协作，抽出一个人来，根本不影响生产。水箱四小组也调整了劳动组织，决定从十二个人中调出四个人来。结果全车间抽调出了十六个人。早已有了准备的二车间也提出可以外调十人。管理干部看到工人的热情，就向厂长提出：“还差多少，我们全包了。”这样开三班所需要的三十个工人就全部解决了。厂长和党支部书记都感慨地说：增人的问题我们早和工人商量，不早解决了吗！
    三班生产开始以后，机器日夜不停，产量迅速上升。从9日开始，铁丝的平均日产量比8日前提高了30％以上。
