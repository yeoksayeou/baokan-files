Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 7th. The delegations of the Communist Parties of Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg held a meeting in Luxembourg on March 4th and 5th and adopted a joint statement expressing anxiety about the recent plans to build atomic weapons and rocket weapons bases in the Ardennes region (within the territory of France, Belgium, and Luxembourg) and the Netherlands, because this plan puts these densely populated areas with highly concentrated industry and cities in extreme danger.

The statement also expressed concern about the role of West German revanchists playing a vanguard role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and their control of weapons of mass destruction; and expressed fraternal solidarity with the German Communist Party and all peace forces who are waging an unyielding struggle.

The statement emphasized that in the face of danger, whether the people can maintain high vigilance and immediately take joint action is a matter of life and death.

The joint statement called on the working class and all peace forces to intensify the various forms of struggle that have already been launched to promote peace and the security of all nations. The statement stated that the Communist Parties will redouble their efforts to effectively unite the people of their respective countries in order to smash the plans that would bring death to millions and destroy humanity's precious wealth.

Artur Ramette, commenting on the joint statement of the four parties in "l'Humanité," pointed out: In these four countries, Communists, Socialists, Catholic Socialists, trade unions, women's organizations, youth organizations, and resistance fighters' organizations are taking concerted action to express their opinions on the issue of rocket bases.

The Communist Parties of the four countries, in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, have come together, hoping to first call on the working class and at the same time call on all peace forces to take more active action to thwart those war-mongering plans.

    比法荷卢四国共产党联合发出号召
    粉碎制造死亡和毁灭财富的计划
    新华社巴黎7日电　比利时、法国、荷兰、卢森堡四国共产党代表团3月4日和5日在卢森堡举行会议并且通过了联合声明，对于最近将在阿登地区（在法、比、卢境内）和荷兰建筑原子武器和火箭武器基地的计划表示焦虑，因为这个计划使得这些人口稠密、工业和城市高度集中的地区陷入了极端的危险之中。
    声明并且对西德复仇主义者将在北大西洋公约组织中起先锋作用和掌握大规模毁灭性武器表示不安；对正在进行不屈不挠的斗争的德国共产党和一切和平力量表示兄弟的声援。
    声明强调指出，在危险面前，人民是否能保持高度警惕和立即采取共同行动是一个关系到生死存亡的问题。
    联合声明号召工人阶级和一切和平力量加紧进行业已展开的各种形式的斗争以促进和平和各国人民的安全。声明表示，共产党将加倍努力来有效地团结本国人民，以便粉碎那些会给千百万人带来死亡，使人类宝贵的财富遭到毁灭的计划。
    阿图尔·拉麦特在“人道报”上评论四党联合声明时指出：在这四个国家里，共产党人、社会党人、天主教社会党人、工会、妇女组织、青年组织和抵抗战士组织正在采取一致行动，对火箭基地问题表示自己的意见。
    四个国家的共产党根据无产阶级国际主义的精神会聚一堂，希望首先号召工人阶级同时号召一切和平力量更加积极活动，以挫败那些好战计划。
