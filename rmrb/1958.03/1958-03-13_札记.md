    Notes
    The Price of a Box of Matches
    The Secretary-General of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Pote Sarasin, recently said that the people of the member countries of this group only need to spend the equivalent of a box of matches per person per year to "earn a living freely" and obtain "benefits" in economic, social and other aspects.
    According to Sarasin, joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization seems to be the cheapest thing in the world. However, the reality is quite the opposite. Since these countries joined this aggressive bloc, they have been suffocated by various unbearable military burdens. People's lives are becoming more and more difficult. More seriously, their independent sovereignty and freedom have been deprived, and their security has also been lost. They have not gained any benefits, and the price they have paid is immeasurable. Can these costs be equal to just a few boxes of matches?!
    Why So Secretive?
    According to Reuters, at the Manila Conference, Western countries will "suggest" holding a "special restrictive meeting" to discuss "Southeast Asian security issues." Moreover, when the meeting is held, "each party will only bring one advisor and no records will be taken of the discussions."
    Why be so secretive? It turns out that news had already leaked that Dulles was eager to use the Manila Conference to plan interference in Indonesia, but he was afraid to publicly propose this proposition, and he also did not trust the representatives of some member countries of the group. Therefore, he requested a secret meeting and expelled some representatives of "free countries" from the venue.
    The more secretive the United States is, the more it shows how despicable and filthy the United States' attempt to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs is. But as the saying goes, "If you don't want people to know, don't do it." If the United States does not abandon its dirty plans, no matter how secret the meeting is, it cannot cover up the sinister face of the United States.
    Blood Money
    At this Manila Conference, Philippine President Garcia spared no effort in selling his strength for the US aggressive policy. US Secretary of State Dulles greatly appreciated this and publicly praised the President's "loyalty is well known" at the opening ceremony of the Manila Conference.
    However, people should not think that Garcia's "loyal" performance was just to win Dulles's few compliments; he had other plans.
    The Associated Press reported that Garcia and Dulles held a breakfast meeting on the 12th to discuss the Philippine President's visit to the United States this summer. The Associated Press revealed that Garcia wanted to go, but did not want to return empty-handed.
    As a result, people suddenly realized that Garcia's strenuous performance was originally to ask Washington for a sum of "blood money."

    札记
    一盒火柴的代价
    东南亚条约组织的秘书长沙拉信最近说，这个集团的成员国的人民每人每年只要花费等于买一盒火柴的钱，就可以“自由自在地谋生”，并在经济、社会等各方面获得“利益”。
    照沙拉信的说法，参加东南亚条约组织似乎是一件最便宜的事了。但是，事实却恰恰相反。这些国家加入这个侵略集团以来，各种各样不堪忍受的军事负担已经压得他们喘不过气来。人民的生活是越来越困难了。更严重的是他们的独立主权和自由被剥夺了，他们的安全也失去了保障。他们没有得到任何好处，而付出的代价却是不可估计的。难道这些代价只等于几盒火柴吗？！
    为什么鬼鬼祟祟
    据路透社报道，在马尼拉会议上，西方国家将要“建议”召开一次“特别的限制性会议”来讨论“东南亚安全问题”。而且，开会时“每方只携带一名顾问并且对讨论事项不作纪录”。
    为什么要这样鬼鬼祟祟呢？原来早有消息透露，杜勒斯是急于想利用马尼拉会议来策划对印度尼西亚的干涉，但他又不敢公开提出这个主张，同时对于这个集团的某些成员国的代表也不敢信任。于是，他就要求召开秘密会议，并且把一部分“自由国家”的代表从会场上赶出去。
    美国愈是这样鬼鬼祟祟，愈说明美国企图干涉印度尼西亚内政的勾当的卑鄙龌龊。但是俗语说得好：“若要人不知，除非己莫为”。美国如果不放弃它的肮脏计划，不管怎样秘密的会议也是掩盖不住美国的凶恶面目的。
    卖命钱
    菲律宾总统加西亚在这次马尼拉会议上，为美国侵略政策声嘶力竭地卖尽了力气。美国国务卿杜勒斯对此大为赏识，并在马尼拉会议的开幕式上当众表扬这位总统的“忠诚是众所周知的”。
    但是，人们不要以为，加西亚的这番“忠诚”表演不过仅仅是为了博得杜勒斯的这几句称赞，他还另有别的打算。
    美联社报道说，加西亚与杜勒斯于12日举行了一次早餐会议，商谈了这位菲律宾总统今夏去美国访问的事。美联社透露说，加西亚想去，但不想空手而回。
    于是，人们由此恍然大悟，加西亚的声嘶力竭的表演，原来是要借此向华盛顿讨一笔“卖命钱”。
