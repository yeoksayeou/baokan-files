Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th – Lichuan County in Hubei Province combined the county Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Commercial Bureau, and Service Bureau into one entity. For more than half a year, this approach has proven to have many benefits. At the recent Hubei Provincial Financial and Economic Conference, representatives from Lichuan County introduced their bold reform of commercial institutions.

Lichuan County began reforming its commercial institutions in June of last year. The county Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Commercial Bureau, and Service Bureau were merged into the county Supply and Marketing Cooperative, implementing unified leadership, unified management, and unified accounting.

After the merger of the commercial institutions, the phenomena of uncoordinated purchasing and sales plans and mutual entanglement in business between the original three departments were eliminated, concentrating efforts to support agricultural production.

    利川改革商业机构
    供销社商业局服务局三合一
    据新华社武汉4日电　湖北省利川县把县供销社、商业局和服务局合而为一，半年多以来证明这样做法有很多好处。在最近召开的湖北省财经会议上，利川县的代表介绍了他们这种大胆改革商业机构的作法。
    利川县改革商业机构是去年6月份开始的。县供销社、商业局和服务局合并成县供销社，实行统一领导、统一经营和统一核算。
    商业机构合并后，原来三个部门之间购销计划互不衔接、业务上互相牵扯的现象消除了，集中力量支援了农业生产。
