Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 6th: The Communist Party Committee of Zhapo Township in Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province, has established experimental boats for fisheries production. Now these experimental boats have set sail.

The Zhapo Township Party Committee requires that the four pairs of seven-row large trawl experimental boats established in the Sea Gull Cooperative produce 6,000 dan of fish each pair this year, the shallow sea medium-sized trawl experimental boats produce 2,500 dan of fish each pair, and the shallow sea general fresh trawl experimental boats produce 1,000 dan of fish each pair; all of which are much higher than the local average yield.

The Party Committee also decided that all cadres must go out to sea with the boats to produce, sharing the fate and breathing the same air as the fishermen, ensuring the success of the experimental boats, summarizing advanced experiences for promotion, and striving to reach the production technical level of a "big worker" (production commander) within ten years.

    新华社广州6日电　中共广东阳江县闸坡镇委员会在渔业生产方面建立试验船。现在这些试验船都已扬帆出海了。
    闸坡镇党委会要求在海鸥社建立的四对七艕大拖风试验船，今年每对要产鱼六千担，浅海中型拖风试验船每对要产鱼二千五百担，浅海一般鲜拖试验船每对要产鱼一千担；都比当地的一般产量高出很多。
    党委会还决定今后所有干部都要随船出海生产，和渔民同命运、共呼吸，保证搞好试验船，总结先进经验加以推广，并且要争取十年内达到大工（生产指挥）的生产技术水平。
