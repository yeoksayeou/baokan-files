    Conserve Water, Irrigate at the Right Time
    Shanxi Farmers Begin to Fight Against Drought

    (Our dispatch) Shanxi province is universally launching drought prevention and combating activities to ensure timely sowing.

    As the land thaws, farmers from south to north across Shanxi province are driving cattle and stone rollers, tilling the land day and night to break the ice. Under the slogan of "cultivate one layer, harrow one layer, protect one layer," various areas aim to universally harrow, finely harrow, and shallowly harrow all of the province's more than 48 million mu of spring-sown arable land to retain soil moisture and sow in a timely manner.

    Agricultural cooperatives in the irrigation areas along the Fen River, Sanggan River, Hutuo River, and other seven major river systems are actively drawing water for spring irrigation. To conserve water and expand the spring irrigation area, most agricultural cooperatives are actively organizing members to repair canals, flatten the land on large fields, and divide it into smaller ridges and furrows.

    Since last winter, Shanxi Province has experienced a lack of rain and snow, and some areas are currently showing signs of drought. The Yuci and Jinan Prefectural Committees of the Chinese Communist Party have both held emergency meetings on drought resistance and moisture conservation, demanding that various areas make persistent efforts to overcome the threat of drought, ensure timely sowing, and achieve this year's leap forward targets for agricultural production.

    节约用水  适时春灌
    山西农民开始和干旱现象作斗争
    本报讯　山西各地普遍展开了防旱抗旱活动，保证适时下种。
    随着土地解冻，山西省从南到北满山遍野的农民驾着牛犋、石碾夜以继日地顶凌耙地。各地在“消一层，耙一层，保一层”的口号下，要把全省四千八百多万亩春播耕地普遍多耙、细耙、浅耙以保持土壤水份，适时下种。
    沿汾河、桑干河、滹沱河等七条较大河系灌区的农业社正积极引水春浇。大部分农业社为节约用水扩大春浇面积，积极组织社员整修渠道，在大块田面上平整土地、划小畦垅。
    山西省去冬以来缺雨少雪，目前部分地区已呈现旱象。中共榆次、晋南地委都召开了抗旱保墒的紧急会议，要求各地再接再厉战胜干旱的威胁，保证适时播种，实现今年农业生产的跃进指标。
