        South Vietnamese People's "March 19th" Anti-American Struggle

        In early 1950, when French colonialists were deeply mired in the quagmire of the Indochina war of aggression, and facing severe crises in military, political, and economic aspects, the United States attempted to directly intervene in Indochina. Prior to this, the United States had continuously supplied the French aggressors with large quantities of arms to massacre the people of Indochina.

        In mid-March of that year, the United States sent two warships to Saigon, preparing to conduct a so-called "exercise" in conjunction with more than one hundred aircraft from an aircraft carrier in the central Vietnamese waters to intimidate the people of Indochina. This act of intervention by the United States aroused great indignation among the people of Saigon and Dike.

        On the morning of March 19, 13,000 workers, students, and citizens gathered inside and outside a school in Saigon, starting a vigorous anti-American demonstration. At that time, the French colonial authorities dispatched tanks, armored vehicles, gendarmes, police, and secret agents to surround the demonstrating masses, throwing tear gas in an attempt to disperse them. However, the demonstration队伍 advanced regardless of the enemy's encirclement, and people along the way joined the ranks, constantly expanding the momentum. On that afternoon, the number of people joining the anti-American demonstrations in Saigon and Dike totaled approximately 300,000. The demonstrators raised the golden star red flag, marching all the way to the vicinity of the pier where the American warships were docked, shouting slogans such as "Down with American imperialism" and "American imperialism get out." Another group of people thronged to the city hall, tearing down the French and American flags hung up by the French colonial authorities to welcome the American warships. The streets were plastered with anti-American slogans, and many French vehicles were decorated with Vietnamese flags. Under the momentum of this great patriotic struggle, many police officers took off their uniforms to show their support for the struggle of the masses. Some secret agents automatically surrendered their guns to the masses. During this struggle, the Vietnamese People's Army also shelled the American warships from the suburbs.

        Under the pressure of the righteous actions of the people of Saigon and Dike, the American warships had no choice but to withdraw from Saigon on the night of March 19. The "exercise" plan to threaten the people of Indochina was declared a failure.

    南越人民“三一九”反美斗争
    1950年初，当法国殖民者深陷在印度支那侵略战争泥潭中，军事、政治、经济等各方面陷于严重危机的时候，美国就企图直接干涉印度支那。在这以前，美国已经不断以大量的军火供给法国侵略者来屠杀印度支那人民。
    这一年的3月中旬，美国派两艘军舰到西贡，准备同在中越海岸的一艘航空母舰上的一百多架飞机联合举行所谓“演习”来恫吓印度支那人民。美国的这个干涉行动，引起了西贡、堤岸人民的巨大激愤。
    3月19日上午，一万三千名工人、学生和市民在西贡的一所学校内外集合，开始了轰轰烈烈的反美示威游行。当时，法国殖民当局派了坦克车、装甲车、宪兵、警察和暗探把示威群众包围起来，投掷催泪弹企图驱散他们。但示威队伍不顾敌人的包围前进，沿途群众纷纷加入行列，声势不断壮大。在当天下午西贡、堤岸两市加入反美大示威的人数，共达三十万名左右。示威群众举起金星红旗，一直拥到美舰停舶的码头附近，高呼“打倒美国帝国主义”和“美帝国主义滚出去”等口号。另一部分群众拥到市政厅前，把法国殖民当局挂起来欢迎美舰的美法两国国旗撕下。街道上贴满了反美的标语，许多法国车辆被插上了越南国旗。在这场伟大的爱国斗争的声势之下，许多警察脱下了制服表示支持群众的斗争。有的密探自动向群众缴了枪。在这次斗争当中，越南人民军还从市郊向美舰开炮轰击。
    在西贡、堤岸人民正义的压力之下，美国军舰不得不在3月19日夜撤离西贡。威胁印度支那人民的“演习”计划宣告失败。
