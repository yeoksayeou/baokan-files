    Hand-Operated Wooden Wheel Waterwheel
    Created by Liu Xueren of Liuwenzhai Cooperative, Mengzhai Township, Yuanyang County, Henan Province. This waterwheel uses the swinging force of a wooden wheel and an iron wheel in the middle to drive the gears at the wellhead. Each unit costs more than seventy yuan to manufacture. It can draw water from a well three zhang deep; with two people cranking, it can pump 60 tons of water per hour. (Attached picture)

    河南原阳县孟寨乡刘文寨社刘学仁创造。这种水车是利用木轮和中间铁轮的甩动力量，带动井口齿轮。每部造价七十多元。可以抽三丈深的井水；两个人摇，每小时出水六十吨。（附图片）
