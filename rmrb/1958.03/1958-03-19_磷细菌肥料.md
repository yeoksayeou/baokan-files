    Phosphorus Bacteria Fertilizer
    A phosphorus bacteria fertilizer that costs little, has great effect, and is simple to use has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Northeast Agricultural Science Institute and has been handed over to the local state-owned Liaoyuan Fertilizer Factory in Jilin Province and Songjiang Chemical Factory in Heilongjiang Province for mass production.
    Phosphorus bacteria fertilizer can accelerate the decomposition of organic phosphorus compounds in the soil, allowing crops to absorb them, greatly promoting crop growth. According to large-scale production tests conducted in various parts of Northeast China in 1956 and 1957, inoculation with phosphorus bacteria fertilizer can generally increase the average yield of various crops by more than 10%.

    磷细菌肥料
    一种花钱少、效果大、用法简单的磷细菌肥料，最近在东北农业科学研究所正式试制成功，并已交给地方国营吉林省辽源肥料厂和黑龙江省松江化工厂进行大量生产。
    磷细菌肥料可以加速土壤中有机磷化合物分解，供农作物吸收，大大促使作物的生育。据1956年和1957年在东北各地的大面积生产试验，接种磷细菌肥料以后，一般可以使各种作物平均增产10％以上。（据新华社讯）
