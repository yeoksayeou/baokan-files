    Gamblers in "Expert" Clothing
    Under the reactionary and terroristic rule of the dictator Batista, Havana, the capital of Cuba, became a breeding ground for sin. After nightfall, neon lights illuminated the bustling city, and American businessmen and tourists swaggered through the streets. Casinos sprung up everywhere, prostitutes solicited customers on the streets, American goods filled the shop windows, and obscene Hollywood movies infested the place like cockroaches. For the Cuban people, whose lives were on the brink of desperation, this was a tragic and desolate picture.
    Batista, the puppet of Wall Street in the United States and the dictator of Cuba, had inextricable connections with American gangsters, thugs, and gamblers. The American "Washington Post" and "Time Magazine" have recently exposed some of these sinful dealings.
    Batista collaborated with the heads of gangster syndicates in New York, Chicago, and other places. Batista allowed several well-known American gamblers to enter Cuba as "experts" hired by the Cuban Ministry of Labor and open large gambling dens in Havana.
    The American "experts" who entered Cuba included Clarke, the gambling king of Las Vegas, the famous American gambling city, Levinsohn, and Lansky, who controlled the gambling industry in New Jersey and Florida. The American "experts" occupied large hotels in Havana. Each of them paid the Cuban government a registration fee of $25,000 to open a casino and then officially started business, paying a tax of $2,000 per month according to regulations. The Cuban government allowed duty-free imports of gambling equipment as a sign of preferential treatment. It is said that the fees paid by the "experts" all went into Mrs. Batista's purse.
    American "expert" Lansky (see attached picture) entered Cuba under the guise of an "investment advisor." His passport was valid for two years. However, in less than a year, Lansky had taken control of the gambling industry in Havana.
    The American "experts," who were indulging in their sweet dreams, did not expect that the report on American crime syndicates published by the Kefauver Committee of the U.S. Congress unintentionally exposed Lansky's background. This report not only pointed out that Lansky was one of the six major gangsters in the United States but also listed several of his criminal activities: he ran casinos on the east and west coasts of the United States, and he was involved with the "Murder, Inc." controlled by the American Mafia.
    Because of the exposure of the background of "investment advisor" Lansky, the Cuban reactionary government had to pretend to order the closure of the casinos. However, the large casino attached to the "Hilton Hotel," which has 630 rooms, continued to operate as usual. The casino boss there was no longer "investment advisor" Lansky, but his agent, another American "expert."

    披着“专家”外衣的赌棍
    在独裁者巴蒂斯塔的反动恐怖统治下，古巴首府哈瓦那成了罪恶的渊薮。入夜以后，霓虹灯光照耀着热闹的市区，从美国来的商人、游客趾高气扬地在街头漫步。赌场林立，妓女们在街头招揽着顾客，美国商品摆满了商店的橱窗，好莱坞的淫猥电影像蟑螂一般充斥着。对生活濒临绝境的古巴人民说来，这是一副悲惨、凄凉的图画。
    美国华尔街的傀儡、古巴独裁者巴蒂斯塔与美国流氓、匪徒、赌棍有着千丝万缕的联系，不可分割的关联。美国“华盛顿邮报”、“时代周刊”对这个罪恶的勾当，最近有了一些暴露。
    巴蒂斯塔与纽约、芝加哥等地的流氓帮会首脑进行了合作。巴蒂斯塔允许美国若干著名的赌棍以古巴劳工部聘用的“专家”的身份，进入古巴，在哈瓦那开设大赌窟。
    进入古巴的美国“专家”，有美国著名赌城拉斯维加斯的赌博大王克拉克，列芬逊，还有控制着新泽西州与佛罗里达州赌业的兰斯基。美国“专家”占用了哈瓦那的大旅馆，他们每人向古巴政府缴纳了二万五千美元的开设赌场登记费，就正式营业，每月照章再缴纳二千美元的税款。古巴政府准许赌具免税进口，以示优惠。据说“专家”们缴纳的费用都入了巴蒂斯塔夫人的钱袋。
    美国“专家”兰斯基（见附图）是以“投资顾问”的名义进入古巴的。护照有效期间为两年。但是，不到一年兰斯基就控制了哈瓦那的赌业。
    好梦正酣的美国“专家”们，没有料到美国国会克弗维尔委员会发表的、关于美国犯罪集团的报告无意暴露了兰斯基的底细。这个报告不但指出兰斯基是美国六大流氓之一，并且列举了他的若干罪恶活动：他在美国东、西海岸开设着赌场，他与美国黑手党操纵的“暗杀公司”有着关系。
    由于“投资顾问”兰斯基底细的暴露，古巴反动政府只得装模作样下令封闭赌场。但是拥有六百三十间房间的“希尔顿大饭店”所附设的大赌场照常营业。那里的赌场老板不再是“投资顾问”兰斯基，而是他的代理人、另一名美国“专家”。
