    Not Just This Also
    Ye Shengtao
    I think that improving writing style seems to be a matter of language and words, but it's not just a matter of language and words. It seems to be a matter of when you pick up the pen, but in reality, much preparation is needed beforehand.
    If the understanding is not accurate, the comprehension is not thorough, and the consideration is not comprehensive, and it is brought out just like that, people will say, this is not a good article, or, this kind of writing style is not good. Then, is it the language and words that are not good, or is there a problem with the understanding, comprehension, consideration, and so on? I think the problem lies in the understanding, comprehension, consideration, and so on.
    To further understand, further comprehend, and carefully consider at the moment of picking up the pen is a common occurrence. But the more common situation is that many things seem to be clear in one's mind, like goods stored in a warehouse, waiting to be picked up and written, like selecting suitable goods and moving them out. If everything were to be understood, comprehended, and considered temporarily, what kind of article could be written? In reality, that's not the case. It can be seen that whether an article is good or not, whether the writing style is good or not, is mostly determined by the storage in the warehouse.
    Let's talk about language and words. Language refers to spoken language, and words refer to language written on paper. Since they are essentially one, we can just say language. Language is originally something that is conventionally agreed upon, used by everyone; there is no language that belongs to only one family. However, each person learns language from childhood and is influenced by language from various aspects in society, so the language habits developed are not the same, and some are good and some are not good. For example, being ungrammatical (that is, violating the rules of language), misusing words (that is, words not corresponding to actual things), and incoherent statements (that is, awkward in meaning and tone), these are bad language habits. When one is accustomed to it, one naturally doesn't feel it, and it is brought into the article when writing. Others will say that this article has problems in language, and this kind of writing cannot be considered a good writing style. To have good language habits, one must rely on practice. Temporary deliberation certainly has its benefits, but it is always better to develop good habits, which can guarantee that nothing goes wrong. In this way, even the use of language is not just a matter of when you pick up the pen.
    If we want to improve our writing style, we cannot only pay attention to the language aspect, but especially emphasize the understanding, comprehension, consideration, and so on, which are fundamental. We cannot think that putting more effort at the moment of picking up the pen will be enough; we must store good goods and develop good habits in peacetime to truly express a good writing style.
    This short article just expresses this superficial meaning.

    不仅此也

    我想，改进文风好像是语言文字的事，其实不光是语言文字的事，好像是拿起笔来那时候的事，其实需要事前准备的多。
    如果认识不确切，理解不透彻，考虑不周到，就那样拿出来，大家说，这是不好的文章，或者说，这样的文风不好。那么，到底是语言文字不好呢，还是认识、理解、考虑、等等方面有问题？我以为问题在认识、理解、考虑等等方面。
    在拿起笔来那时候再深入认识，深入理解，仔细考虑，原是常有的事。但是更普遍的情形是，好些东西都似乎心中有数了，好像货色储藏在仓库里，待拿起笔来写，就像挑适用的货色搬出来。要是说什么东西都待临时认识，临时理解，临时考虑，那还写得成什么文章？实际上也没有这回事。可见文章好不好，文风好不好，多半决定于仓库里的储藏。
    再就语言文字说。语言，就是口头说的语言，文字，指写在纸面的语言，既然二而一，单说语言就可以了。语言本来是约定俗成的东西，大家通用，没有只此一家的语言。可是各人从小学习语言，在社会里受各方面的语言影响，养成的语言习惯并不一样，有好有不好。譬如不合语法（就是违背语言的规律），误用词语（就是词语跟实际事物不相应），前言后语不接气（就是意义上语气上别扭），诸如此类，就是不好的语言习惯。习惯了，自己当然不觉得，写文章就带到文章里去。人家却说这文章语言方面有毛病，这样写法算不得好文风。语言习惯要它好，靠平时磨炼。临时推敲固然有好处，总不如养成好习惯，可以保证万无一失。这样说来，就是运用语言，也不仅是拿起笔来那时候的事。
    咱们要改进文风，不能光注意语言方面，尤其要着重认识、理解、考虑等等方面，那是根本。不能认为拿起笔来那时候多下些工夫就成，要在平时储藏好货色，养成好习惯才真能表现好文风。
    这篇短文就说这么一层浅薄的意思。
