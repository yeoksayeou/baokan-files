From the Editor's Desk:

    720,000 Tons of Grain!
    Farmers have a saying: "Crops depend on fertilizer to flourish." Currently, the average yield per mu of grain in our country is only about 200 jin, while in Japan it is about 600 jin. The reason for this, in addition to better irrigation conditions, is mainly the large-scale use of chemical fertilizers. The three sets of nitrogen fertilizer equipment manufactured by Heilongjiang Province this year alone can increase grain production by 720,000 tons annually.
    In order to achieve fertilizer chemicalization, we must not only build large-scale chemical fertilizer factories, but also build hundreds and thousands of small chemical fertilizer plants. Not only should the central government and provinces build them, but every special district and every county should also build them. Manufacturing equipment for hundreds and thousands of chemical fertilizer plants is both an arduous and glorious task. More than 20 factories in Heilongjiang can manufacture equipment for large-scale fertilizer plants through collaboration. Other regions can also manufacture equipment for small and medium-sized fertilizer plants through collaboration.
    We hope that large and small machine factories across the country will work together to promote fertilizer chemicalization!

### 七十二万吨粮！

    七十二万吨粮！
    农民有句俗话：“庄稼一支花，全靠肥当家”。目前我国粮食的单位面积产量，全国平均每亩只有二百斤，而日本是六百斤左右，其原因除水利条件较好以外，主要是大量使用化学肥料。黑龙江省今年制造的三套氮肥设备，每年生产的化学肥料就能增产七十二万吨粮食。
    为了实现肥料化学化，我们不只建设大型的化学肥料工厂，还要建设数以千百计的小型化肥厂，不只中央和省要建设，每一个专区、每一个县也要建设。为上百上千个化学肥料厂制造设备，是一件既艰巨又光荣的任务。黑龙江二十多个工厂用协作的办法能制造大型化肥厂的设备，其他地方用协作的办法，也一定能够制造中小型的化肥厂设备。
    希望全国大大小小的机器厂，齐心协力为促进肥料化学化而努力！
