    Corn with Seven Ears
    On the snow-flurried Duanlong Mountain in western Hunan in March, a type of corn with seven ears on a stalk was discovered. The stalk of this corn is as thick as a person's arm. Last year, the Yangjia Agricultural Cooperative planted 5.8 mu of this corn, and one-third of it grew five to seven ears per stalk. The harvest yielded 5,280 jin of dried corn kernels, averaging 1,015 jin per mu, which is more than eight times the average corn yield in the vicinity. Among them, the stalks with seven ears yielded 3.5 jin of kernels each.

    长七个棒子的玉米
    在三月飘雪的湘西断龙山上，发现一种长有七个棒子的包谷（玉米）。这种包谷禾秆有人手臂那么粗。去年，杨家农业社种植了五亩八分，有三分之一长了五—七个棒子，收获干包谷籽五千二百八十斤，平均一亩产一千零一十五斤，比附近包谷亩产量高八倍多。其中长七个棒子的，每株收籽三斤半。
