Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, Report at the National People's Congress Nationalities Committee Meeting on Rectification and Socialist Education Among Minority Nationalities (Continued)

While opposing separatism, it is also necessary to oppose isolationism. The question of whether or not to have Han cadres and Han immigrants largely boils down to whether or not we want socialism and the prosperity of all nationalities.

While opposing separatism, it is also necessary to oppose isolationism. The unity of the Han nationality and minority nationalities is of decisive significance in the cause of national unity in our country. At present, some people oppose Han cadres and Han immigrants. Some nationalists even abuse their power to deliberately install many counter-revolutionaries and bad elements of their own nationality in state organs, colluding with each other to exclude the Han nationality. This is, of course, extremely wrong and reactionary. It must be recognized that the question of whether or not to have Han cadres and Han immigrants largely boils down to whether or not we want socialism and the prosperity of all nationalities. Some national separatists often regard excluding the Han nationality as a very important part of their activities, and those who have the idea of excluding the Han nationality, if not overcome, can easily develop into serious separatism. Therefore, opposing all tendencies to exclude the Han nationality is a very important aspect of the struggle against local nationalism.

One of the important excuses for some people to exclude the Han nationality is the so-called "assimilation" issue. They describe the work of Han cadres and Han people in helping fraternal nationalities build socialism as "wanting to assimilate minority nationalities," which is, of course, very absurd. The gradual integration of all nationalities based on equal status is a natural law of social development. However, the integration of nationalities is by no means a matter of a short period of time, but requires a very long historical process. In the process of jointly building socialism, as a result of the mutual approach and mutual influence of all nationalities, certain phenomena of inter-ethnic integration have emerged. This is not a bad thing, but a good thing. We have always firmly opposed forced assimilation of minority nationalities, because that is national oppression; but we never oppose the natural integration of nationalities, because this is a progressive trend in historical development. Closely related to this is the issue of understanding and attitude towards national customs and habits. We believe that national customs and habits are determined by the special conditions of social life. With the changes in social life conditions, national customs and habits cannot remain unchanged. Moreover, national customs and habits have excellent components, as well as outdated and useless components. Maintaining and promoting excellent traditions is necessary and essential; but if we emphasize maintaining and developing all national customs and habits indiscriminately, even regardless of whether they are suitable for socialism, it would be very wrong.

    The socialist stance supports the leadership of the Party, while the nationalist stance opposes the leadership of the Party. Without the Communist Party, there could be no national liberation and national equality, and there could be no national prosperity. Nationalists attacking the Party are attempting to overthrow the Party's leadership and achieve capitalist restoration.

Another fundamental difference between the socialist stance and the nationalist stance is that the socialist stance supports the leadership of the Party, while the nationalist stance opposes the leadership of the Party.

The Communist Party of China is the leading core for our country to build socialism. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his political report at the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "In the socialist cause of our country, there can be no proletarian dictatorship, and the proletarian dictatorship is realized through the leadership of the proletarian party—the Communist Party. The leadership of the Communist Party of China lies in its ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, its correct political and organizational lines, its rich experience in struggle and work, and its ability to concentrate the wisdom of the people of the whole country and transform this wisdom into a unified will and disciplined action. Not only in the past, but also in the future, in order to ensure that our country can effectively handle complex domestic and international affairs, it is necessary to have the leadership of such a party." This fully shows that if all nationalities want to build socialism, it is absolutely impossible without the leadership of the Communist Party. Due to various reasons in historical development, the political, economic, and cultural development of various minority nationalities in our country is generally very underdeveloped. Some nationalities were even under the rule of slavery and serfdom in the early days of liberation. If it were not for the Communist Party leading the way on the socialist road, how could the political, economic, and cultural development of all nationalities have achieved publicly recognized significant development in just eight years? How can those nationalities in different stages of development surpass one or even several stages of social development to build a socialist society? Obviously, this is impossible.

It must also be pointed out that the Communist Party of China is the true representative and defender of the interests of all nationalities in our country. It always adheres to the principle of complete equality among all nationalities and firmly opposes discrimination and oppression among nationalities. The Communist Manifesto states: The communists "in the struggles of the proletarians of different nationalities, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality." Lenin said: "To be an internationalist social democrat, one should not only think of one's own nation, but should consider the interests of all nations, the common freedom and equality of all nations, higher than one's own nation." Our party's glorious ethnic policy and its principles in dealing with ethnic issues fully illustrate the party's nature. The people of all nationalities in our country have suffered deeply from national oppression in the past long years. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the system of national oppression was abolished, the policy of national equality was realized, and the great goal of national prosperity is being advanced. Without the Communist Party, there could be no national liberation and national equality, and there could be no national prosperity. Is it not obvious that only the Communist Party of China is the true representative and defender of the interests of all nationalities in our country?

The people of all nationalities in our country must sincerely support the leadership of the Party and resolutely oppose any remarks and actions that weaken and oppose the leadership of the Party. In this rectification movement, some nationalists have launched a fierce attack on the leadership of the Party, saying that "the Communist Party is the party of the Han people and cannot represent the interests of the minority nationalities" and "national prosperity can be achieved even without the Communist Party." These are all extremely reactionary. The leadership of the Communist Party is the decisive condition for building socialism. The nationalists' attack on the Party is aimed at trying to overthrow the Party's leadership in order to realize capitalist restoration. However, the Communist Party has a very deep belief among the broad masses of all nationalities. The nationalists' conspiracy is just like "an ant trying to shake a big tree" and will inevitably be completely crushed.

    Only selfless communists can truly represent the interests of all nationalities.

The strength of the Party's leadership lies in the Party's unity. Lenin once said: "The proletariat can become and will inevitably become an invincible force only because its ideological unity created by Marxist principles, and its organized material unity consolidate it, and this organization unites millions of laborers into an army of the working class." The resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on strengthening Party unity also pointed out: "Party unity is the life of the Party and the basic principle of Marxism-Leninism."

Precisely because the Party's unity and unification are of such great significance, some nationalists with ulterior motives use methods of splitting the Party's unity to weaken the Party's leadership. They say that Party members who are not of their own nationality cannot seek happiness for their own nationality, and only Party members of their own nationality can seek happiness for their own nationality. This is, of course, very wrong. We have always believed that, regardless of which nationality, only selfless communists can closely contact the broad masses of people and truly represent the interests of the people of all nationalities. If they violate communist principles and embark on the path of undermining national unity and national solidarity, even cadres of their own nationality cannot represent, and can only harm, the interests of their own nationality. Since liberation, many Han communist party members have taken root, blossomed, and bore fruit in minority nationalities, serving the local people wholeheartedly and promoting local social development and national prosperity together with minority nationality cadres and people, thus being welcomed and loved by the minority nationality people. Does this not exactly illustrate this point? The local nationalists among the minority nationalities have always claimed to be the representatives of national interests. After the exposure of this rectification movement, it turns out that they are not representatives of national interests at all, but thoroughgoing ambitionists who harm national interests. Does this not illustrate the above-mentioned problem from another aspect?

Some nationalists also advocate dividing party organizations according to nationality. This is even more reactionary. The unity of the Party organization and the communistization of cadres are the highest principles of the Party's organizational line. In the past, the Party put forward the slogan of nationalizing cadres. Its main spirit was to train and use minority nationality cadres, requiring all cadres, including Han cadres, to deeply understand the local actual situation, fully pay attention to national characteristics, and integrate with the local masses. Cadres of their own nationality have many favorable conditions in this regard. Therefore, the Party has always paid attention to training minority nationality cadres, developing Party members among minority nationalities, and selecting minority nationality cadres to participate in local leading organs as much as possible. This is completely necessary and correct. In this regard, there have also been achievements. Therefore, it is absolutely not allowed to use the slogan of nationalization to undermine the principle of the Party's unity and unification, and it is even more not allowed to divide the Party's organization according to nationality.

The resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party on strengthening the Party pointed out: "Undermining the unity of the Party is a violation of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and is helping the enemy to harm the life of the Party." Ethnic separatism in the Party is not only the most dangerous ideology that undermines the unity and unification of the Party, but also a reactionary ideology that splits the unity of the motherland and national unity, and must be resolutely opposed.

In summary, the fundamental difference between the socialist stance and the nationalist stance is also the fundamental difference between the socialist road and the capitalist road. It is necessary to overcome the nationalist stance with the socialist stance and overcome the capitalist road with the socialist road. This is the great task of the current political and ideological revolution of the people of all minority nationalities.
                      (III)
      Continue to carry out rectification and socialist education movements in minority nationalities in depth, and persist in carrying the struggle against local nationalism to the end.

At present, the rectification and socialist education movement is vigorously advancing in various minority nationalities. Our task is to continue to carry out this movement in depth in various minority nationalities, persist in carrying the struggle against local nationalism to the end, and strive for a complete victory in the movement. In the process of carrying out the movement, all localities need to continue to pay attention to the following issues:

      (1) It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the movement. Since this movement is a thorough socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, this requires the Party and government leaders in all relevant regions to have great determination to carry it out resolutely so that the movement can achieve complete victory. On the other hand, rectification and criticism of local nationalism is a very complex task. In addition, the situation in each nationality and locality is different. The Party's foundation in many minority nationalities is still relatively weak, and some minority nationalities still lack communist backbones cultivated from their own nationalities. This requires leaders in all localities to pay attention to adopting a cautious attitude and appropriate steps while making up their minds, steadily advancing, and preventing any simple and rash practices. At the same time, it should also be noted that national feelings and nationalism should not be confused, nor should the cognitive deviations and some unconscious confused thoughts that occur in actual work be criticized as nationalism.

      It is necessary to provide extensive socialist education to the vast number of cadres and people. It is necessary to guide the people of all nationalities to combine love for their nationality with love for the motherland, and to combine national prosperity with the socialist road.

      (2) It is necessary to provide extensive socialist education to the vast number of cadres and people. This movement should first be carried out among party members and cadres, and the focus should be placed within the party. All party members and the vast number of cadres must recognize that the nationalist stance, whether it is the Han chauvinist stance or the local nationalist stance, is fundamentally incompatible with socialism, with the proletarian view of nationality, with Marxism-Leninism, with the road of solidarity and mutual assistance among all nationalities to jointly build socialism, and with the fundamental principles of party building, and should be consciously examined and corrected. In all areas where conditions permit, the movement should be promptly extended and deepened to people from all walks of life such as schools, factories, and rural areas, so that the vast number of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and religious professionals can receive a universal and in-depth socialist education on ethnic issues. In factories, employees of all nationalities should further understand the importance of strengthening national unity and working-class unity and their interrelationship. In rural areas, farmers of all nationalities should be guided to combine love for their nationality with love for the motherland; and to combine national prosperity with the socialist road. In cooperatives jointly established by several nationalities, special attention should also be paid to improving the relationship between members of all nationalities. Among intellectuals, education on the proletarian view of nationality should be carried out to help them overcome the bourgeois view of nationality. In religious circles, education on patriotism, law-abiding, and opposition to bad people and bad deeds should be carried out to strengthen the patriotic and law-abiding concepts of religious personnel. At the same time, in this movement, for the minority nationality people scattered in cities and villages in the interior, in addition to organizing them to participate in general socialist education together with the local people by the relevant departments of the areas to which they belong, the ethnic affairs departments or the Party's united front departments should also convene them for discussions so that they can also receive a socialist education on ethnic issues.

      (3) Rely on minority nationality backbones. In this movement, it is necessary to resolutely rely on the communist backbones in minority nationalities to carry out the work. At the same time, it is necessary to firmly believe in the vast majority of the masses. In the process of carrying out the work, all localities have paid attention to first discussing the issues clearly among the backbones of all nationalities and reaching a consensus before relying on them to mobilize the masses of their own nationalities. This can make the movement develop smoothly. Facts have proved that the vast number of cadres and people of minority nationalities warmly support the Party's call and have actively engaged in the struggle against nationalism. This is an important guarantee for the movement to achieve complete victory.

      Han party members and cadres should seriously criticize Han chauvinism and should not relax the examination and criticism of Han chauvinism because local nationalism has grown anew.

      (4) Pay attention to rectification and improvement. In the past, there were some shortcomings and errors in our ethnic work, some of which were quite serious. The Party committees and government organs in all relevant regions should pay attention to checking and correcting these shortcomings and errors at any time. Moreover, during a certain period of the movement, it should also shift to a stage mainly focused on rectification and improvement in accordance with the relevant instructions of the Party Central Committee. In the rectification and improvement stage, the implementation of ethnic policies should be carefully checked, and the shortcomings and errors existing in the work in various localities should be resolutely and thoroughly corrected. Special attention should be paid to effectively solving some problems that the local people urgently need and have the conditions to solve. The correction of shortcomings and errors in the work must not be relaxed because of the criticism of local nationalism and other circumstances. Only in this way can we further win over and unite those masses in the middle state among all nationalities, completely isolate local nationalists, and improve our ethnic work. Any wrong practices that cover up errors and attempt to evade rectification and improvement must be strictly prevented and corrected.

      (5) Han party members and cadres should seriously criticize Han chauvinism. In the autonomous regions, Han residents, Han party members, and Han cadres should carry out rectification and socialist education in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee for Han areas. Han party members and cadres should more seriously examine and criticize Han chauvinism, and in some places where Han chauvinism is quite serious, they should focus on examining and criticizing it. The examination and criticism of Han chauvinism must not be relaxed because local nationalism has grown anew. It has now been discovered that some Han cadres do not pay attention to examining their existing Han chauvinist thoughts, and some even take the opportunity to resist the Party's policy of ethnic equality. These are all very wrong and must be resolutely corrected. Only in this way can we thoroughly implement the idea of ethnic equality among the Han people, and only then will it be conducive to overcoming local nationalism among minority nationalities. Han party members and cadres and minority nationality party members and cadres can and should criticize each other when carrying out rectification together, but they should all pay attention to focusing on criticizing the nationalist ideas in their own nationalities, and they should all pay attention to avoiding the occurrence of inter-ethnic antagonism, in order to achieve the goal of both distinguishing right from wrong and enhancing unity.

      The Party's ethnic policy and the policy of freedom of religious belief are not allowed to be doubted in the slightest and must be resolutely implemented.

It is necessary to explain here that some people, because they have seen the growth of local nationalism among minority nationalities, doubt the correctness of the Party's ethnic policy, and even believe that in the future, the policy of ethnic regional autonomy can no longer be continued, and that we should no longer pay attention to taking care of ethnic characteristics and ethnic customs and habits, and that we should no longer pay attention to training minority nationality cadres. These are, of course, extremely wrong. The Party's ethnic policy is formulated based on the Marxist-Leninist theory on ethnic issues combined with the actual situation in our country, and the great achievements of ethnic work in recent years have fully proved the correctness of this policy. As long as we pay a little attention to the victories that have been achieved in the cause of the unification of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, and as long as we pay a little attention to the political, economic, and cultural development that has been achieved by all minority nationalities in just a few years, we cannot doubt the correctness of the Party's ethnic policy in the slightest. The growth of local nationalism is a manifestation of the bourgeoisie's struggle and resistance against socialism. This is a phenomenon that is bound to occur in the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. As long as we pay attention to the current situation of class changes in our country, we cannot doubt the Party's policy in the slightest. The Party's policy of ethnic equality, including opposition to nationalism, is a long-term policy, and must be resolutely implemented at all times. Any practice that does not seriously implement this policy cannot be tolerated.

Some people, because they have seen some reactionary upper-class and religious professionals among minority nationalities carry out anti-socialist activities, doubt whether it is necessary to continue to implement the Party's united front policy and the policy of freedom of religious belief. This is also very wrong. In this rectification movement, some ethnic upper-class and religious upper-class did launch vicious attacks on the Party and the people. Their conspiracies to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and undermine the unity of the motherland and national unity aroused great indignation among the people of all nationalities and a serious anti-rightist struggle, which was completely necessary. The bourgeois rightists among all nationalities are enemies of the people. If we do not carry out a resolute struggle against them to completely isolate them among the broad masses of the people, it will be very unfavorable for all nationalities to build socialism, and it will also be very unfavorable for the development and prosperity of all nationalities. Any right-leaning thoughts in this regard must be resolutely opposed. However, it must be seen that such reactionary elements, after all, only account for a minority among the upper-class and religious professionals of minority nationalities throughout the country. The majority of the ethnic upper-class and religious upper-class have made progress to varying degrees in recent years under the unity and education of the Party and the government. Many of them have done a lot of work in different work positions and have become part of the state cadres. Although there are still varying degrees of resistance and erroneous words and deeds to socialism among many people in the ethnic upper-class and religious upper-class, these must be criticized and educated, but their problems still belong to the internal problems of the people and are fundamentally different from rightists. It can be seen that there is no basis for doubting whether it is necessary to continue to implement the Party's united front policy. In the future, the Party will still continue to implement the united front policy towards upper-class figures based on Chairman Mao's six criteria as the political foundation, and continue to unite and transform all those who can be united and transformed. Upper-class figures of all minority nationalities must support the leadership of the Communist Party, support socialism, safeguard the unity and solidarity of the motherland, and strengthen their own transformation. Whether upper-class figures who participate in work should participate in labor training can be decided on a voluntary basis based on their physical condition and other conditions and should not be forced. As for doubting whether it is necessary to continue to implement the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief, there is even less basis for this. Communists can only implement this policy on the religious beliefs of the people and cannot implement any other policy. Moreover, the policy of freedom of religious belief is a long-term policy. As long as the people believe in religion, we will implement this policy. However, the religious community must be patriotic and law-abiding, and it must never be allowed to use freedom of religious belief to carry out anti-socialist reactionary activities. It should be especially pointed out that there are quite a few bad people and bad deeds in the minority religious community who violate the criteria of patriotism and law-abiding. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct education on patriotism, law-abiding, and opposition to bad people and bad deeds in the religious community in this movement. Without this, it will not only be unfavorable to consolidating the socialist system and the unity and unification between nationalities, and unfavorable to the implementation of the policy of freedom of religious belief, but it will also be very unfavorable to the religious community itself.
                    (IV)
      Only by forming a truly proletarian conscious communist core in each nationality can we overcome the bourgeois nationalist tendencies of our own nationality and consolidate national unity. Cultivating communist cadres of minority nationalities is an important key to completely solving the ethnic problem.

Judging from the situation in this rectification movement, the vast majority of party members and cadres of minority nationalities are good, but many people also have nationalism and other bourgeois ideas, and many people cannot distinguish between the socialist stance and the capitalist stance, especially the socialist stance and the nationalist stance. This is because most of the party members and cadres of minority nationalities joined the Party and started working after liberation. Many people are also from families of various exploiting classes. They generally lack Marxist-Leninist class education and class struggle training, and also lack education on the proletarian view of nationality and training in the struggle against local nationalist tendencies. Therefore, many people have many problems in their thinking, and some even have problems in their stance. This situation has presented us with such a serious political task, that is, how to further strengthen the task of cultivating communist cadres from minority nationalities. Chairman Mao once instructed us in 1949: "To completely solve the ethnic problem and completely isolate the ethnic reactionaries, it is impossible without a large number of communist cadres from minority nationalities." Comrade Deng Xiaoping also pointed out in his 1957 report on the rectification movement: "Only by forming a truly proletarian conscious communist core in each nationality can we overcome the bourgeois nationalist tendencies of our own nationality and consolidate the unity and unification between nationalities." It can be seen that cultivating communist cadres of minority nationalities is an important key to completely solving the ethnic problem. If this problem is ignored, our work will inevitably suffer great damage. In the past few years, the Party has done a lot of work in cultivating communist cadres of minority nationalities and has achieved certain results. However, the work in this area is far from meeting the needs of the development of the situation. Not only is the number of communist cadres of minority nationalities very insufficient, but the quality also needs to be improved. In order to further consolidate the unification of the motherland and national unity, and to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, it is necessary to greatly strengthen the work of cultivating communist cadres of minority nationalities, so that each minority nationality has enough communist backbones who can withstand risks. To this end, we must resolutely overcome the shortcomings that existed in the past in the political and ideological work of cadres, and focus on carrying out Marxist-Leninist class education among the vast number of cadres of minority nationalities, so that they understand the great historical significance of the proletarian revolution and the proletarian dictatorship; understand the regularity of class struggle during the transition period. We demand that they truly establish the proletarian stance, master the proletarian class viewpoint, and learn the proletarian method of analysis. Only in this way can they not lose their way in any complex situation, and persevere in fighting for the revolutionary cause to the end.

      Minority nationality cadres should be communistized so that each nationality has enough backbones who can withstand risks.

In order to communistize cadres, it is also necessary to combine this with the anti-local nationalism movement, and focus on carrying out education on the proletarian view of nationality among the vast number of minority nationality cadres, so that they understand that the proletariat does not exploit anyone, and struggles to strive for a social system without exploitation. Therefore, it firmly opposes national oppression and advocates complete equality among all nationalities; it firmly opposes the bourgeoisie's attempts to split the working class and the working people of all nationalities, and advocates the consolidation of the unity of the working class and the working people of all nationalities; it firmly opposes the bourgeoisie's obstruction of the approach of the people of all nationalities, and advocates the continuous increase of friendship between the people of all nationalities, and believes that all nationalities will gradually move towards world harmony in the future. Cadres of minority nationalities must establish the above-mentioned proletarian view of nationality and firmly oppose any manifestation of nationalism. Only in this way can they firmly and unremittingly fight for the unity and unification between nationalities.

In order to communistize cadres, it is also necessary to strengthen the education on the mass viewpoint and the labor viewpoint for minority nationality cadres, so that they truly understand that serving the people wholeheartedly, believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and learning from the masses are qualities that all revolutionaries must possess. We demand that they closely contact the masses and overcome any ideological style that despises and deviates from the masses. They must truly understand the truth that labor creates the world, labor is glorious, and every revolutionary cadre must be tempered in productive labor. Only by establishing the mass viewpoint and the labor viewpoint, and embodying these viewpoints in work and life, can we truly integrate with the masses.

      Every minority nationality cadre should be a promoter, vigorously advancing on all fronts.

In order to communistize cadres, it is also necessary to strengthen the education on improving revolutionary enthusiasm. Today, the great goal of the people of the whole country's great struggle is to build our country into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern scientific culture in the next fifteen years, and to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in the output of steel and other major industrial products. In terms of domestic ethnic issues, we must also help all minority nationalities achieve great development in the next fifteen years. Not only should all nationalities transition to socialist society, but also in terms of economy and culture, those nationalities that were originally not far from the Han nationality can catch up with or approach the level of the Han nationality, and those nationalities that were originally far from the Han nationality can also achieve significant development. In order to complete such an extremely heroic undertaking, the people and cadres of all nationalities in our country must carry out production and work with lofty revolutionary aspirations, high revolutionary enthusiasm, and full labor enthusiasm, overcoming all difficulties and sparing no effort. Cadres of minority nationalities must understand that every revolutionary cadre should be a promoter, vigorously advancing on all fronts, supporting and promoting the development of all new things; they should oppose those who lack vigor, emphasize difficulties and special circumstances, and adopt a negative attitude towards new things. We demand that cadres of all nationalities give full play to revolutionary heroism and overcome all negative factors. Only in this way can the cause of building socialism in minority nationality areas develop vigorously.

The struggle for rectification and criticism of local nationalism is an extremely vivid proletarian class education and view of nationality education for cadres of all nationalities. Insisting on the nationalist stance cannot pass the socialist test.

It should be recognized that the proletarian class viewpoint is the foundation of Marxist-Leninist thought, and only by basically laying this foundation can other problems be solved. The education on the Marxist-Leninist view of nationality, the mass viewpoint, the labor viewpoint, and revolutionary heroism is necessary to establish the proletarian class viewpoint. To educate cadres of minority nationalities on the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint is to require cadres of minority nationalities to finally establish the Marxist-Leninist world outlook and outlook on life, and to fight for the cause of communism to the end.

This struggle for rectification and criticism of local nationalism is an extremely vivid proletarian class education and ethnic view education for cadres of all nationalities. It must be pointed out that bourgeois nationalism is fundamentally incompatible with the proletarian world outlook. People with nationalist ideas not only have defects in their class viewpoint, mass viewpoint, and labor viewpoint, but also have insufficient revolutionary enthusiasm. They often have individualism at the same time, and also often have sectarianism at the same time. It is worth pointing out that a person who looks at revolutionary issues from a nationalist viewpoint can also easily degenerate into a revisionist. It can be seen that if a person with relatively serious nationalist ideas does not thoroughly examine and correct his mistakes in this movement, does not establish a Marxist-Leninist class viewpoint and ethnic viewpoint, and still insists on the nationalist stance, he cannot pass the socialist test. Even those who have some nationalist ideas, especially leading cadres, should bravely light the fire on themselves, conduct self-criticism, and gain training for themselves. Criticism and self-criticism are sharp weapons for communists and all revolutionary cadres to transform themselves. Comrades of minority nationalities should learn to use this weapon bravely and correctly.
                      (V)
    After several months of rectification and socialist education, and after preliminary criticism of local nationalism, significant results have been achieved in many minority nationality areas. The class consciousness of the vast number of minority nationality cadres and people has been raised, and the friendship between all nationalities has been enhanced. Because of the correct ideological understanding, an unprecedented and extremely lively new atmosphere has also emerged in work and production. For example, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region originally planned to expand the irrigated area by 2 million mu this year, 70% more than last year, but under the promotion and encouragement of the socialist education movement, the enthusiasm of the masses is even greater, and this plan has been quickly broken through, and it is expected to increase by more than 600,000 mu; the water conservancy construction plan of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region this year has also been revised from the originally set 2.04 million mu to 3 million mu under the high tide of the socialist enthusiasm of the masses; and in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which is about to be established, water conservancy construction in the past winter and this spring can expand the irrigated area by 11 million mu, which is much more than the total of the past eight years. Many other ethnic autonomous regions have also mustered revolutionary enthusiasm and formulated plans for a great leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production, and are actively leading the masses to set off a production upsurge and begin to realize these plans. This once again proves that it is completely necessary and completely correct to carry out rectification and the socialist education movement against nationalism among minority nationalities. It not only profoundly changes people's political and ideological outlook, but also greatly changes the production outlook in all aspects.

    Now the rectification and socialist education movement is universally and deeply advancing in all minority nationalities throughout the country. We firmly believe that through this great movement, the cause of the unity and unification of all nationalities and the cause of building socialism will surely achieve a great leap forward.

    Let us hold high the glorious banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism and bravely advance in the high tide of socialist construction in the motherland!

    是社会主义，还是民族主义？
    民族事务委员会副主任汪锋在人大民族委员会会议上关于在少数民族中进行整风和社会主义教育问题的报告　（续完）
    在反对分离主义的同时还必须反对孤立主义。要不要汉族干部和汉族移民的问题，在很大程度上就是要不要社会主义、要不要民族繁荣的问题。
    在反对分离主义的同时，还必须反对孤立主义。汉族和少数民族的团结，在我国的民族团结事业中，具有决定的意义。现在有些人反对汉族干部和汉族移民，甚至有的民族主义者利用职权在国家机关中故意安插许多本民族的反革命分子和坏分子，互相勾结起来排斥汉族，这当然是极其错误和反动的。必须认识，要不要汉族干部和汉族移民的问题，在很大的程度上就是要不要社会主义、要不要民族繁荣的问题。有些民族分离主义者往往把排斥汉族作为他们活动的很重要的一部分，而有排斥汉族思想的人，如果不加克服，也很容易发展到严重的分离主义的地步。因此，反对一切排斥汉族的倾向，是反对地方民族主义斗争中的一个很重要的方面。
    有些人排斥汉族的重要借口之一是所谓“同化”问题，他们把汉族干部和汉族人民帮助兄弟民族建设社会主义的工作说成是“要同化少数民族”，这当然是很荒谬的。基于平等地位的各民族的逐步融合，是社会发展的自然规律。但是民族的融合，绝不是短时期内的事，而是需要一个很长的历史过程。在共同建设社会主义的过程中，由于各民族互相接近、互相影响的结果，产生了民族间某些融合的现象。这不仅不是什么坏事，而是一件好事。我们向来坚决反对对少数民族的强制同化，因为那就是民族压迫；但是我们绝不反对民族间的自然的融合，因为这是历史发展中进步的趋势。与此密切相关的，是对民族的风俗习惯的理解和态度问题。我们认为，民族的风俗习惯是社会生活的特殊条件决定的，随着社会生活条件的变动，民族的风俗习惯不可能原封不动。而且民族的风俗习惯中有优良的成分，也有过时的和无益的成分。保持和发扬优良的传统是应该的，也是必须的；但是如果毫不区别地强调保持和发展一切民族的风俗习惯，甚至不管是否适合社会主义，那就是很错误的。
      社会主义立场拥护党的领导，民族主义立场反对党的领导。而如果没有共产党，就不可能有民族解放和民族平等，也就不可能有民族繁荣。民族主义者向党进攻就是企图搞垮党的领导实现资本主义复辟。
    社会主义立场和民族主义立场的另一个根本分歧，就在于社会主义立场拥护党的领导，民族主义立场则反对党的领导。
    中国共产党是我国建设社会主义的领导核心。刘少奇同志在党的第八次代表大会上的政治报告中说：“在我们国家的社会主义事业中不可能没有无产阶级专政，而无产阶级专政是经过无产阶级的政党——共产党的领导来实现的。中国共产党的领导力量，在于它有马克思列宁主义的思想武器，有正确的政治路线和组织路线，有丰富的斗争经验和工作经验，善于把全国人民的智慧集中起来，并且把这种智慧变为统一的意志和有纪律的行动。不但在过去，而且在今后，为了保证我们的国家能够有效地处理国内和国际的复杂事务，都必须有这样一个党的领导。”这就充分说明，各民族要建设社会主义，如果没有共产党的领导是绝对不可能的。我国各少数民族由于历史发展上的种种原因，政治、经济、文化一般是很不发展的，有些民族甚至在解放初期还处于奴隶制和农奴制的统治下。要不是共产党领导走社会主义的道路，各民族的政治、经济和文化怎样能够在短短的八年中得到众所公认的显著的发展呢？那些处于不同发展阶段的民族怎样能够超越一个甚至几个社会发展阶段而建设社会主义社会呢？显然这都是不可能的。
    还必须指出，中国共产党是我国各民族利益的真正代表者和维护者。它永远坚持各民族彻底平等的原则，坚决反对民族间的歧视和压迫。共产党宣言说：共产党人“在不同民族的无产者底斗争中，他们提出和坚持整个无产阶级的超越于民族性的共同利益”。列宁说：“为要做个国际主义者的社会民主党人，就不应单只为自己的民族设想，而是应把一切民族底利益，一切民族底共同自由平等看得比自己的民族更高。”我们党的光辉的民族政策和它处理民族问题的原则精神，就充分说明了党的这种特质。我国各民族人民在过去漫长的岁月中，曾经深受民族压迫的痛苦，只是在中国共产党领导下，才废除了民族压迫制度，实现了民族平等的政策，并且正在向着民族繁荣的伟大目标前进。如果没有共产党，就不可能有民族解放和民族平等，也就不可能有民族繁荣。可见只有中国共产党才是我国各民族利益的真正代表者和维护者，这难道还不明显吗？
    我国各民族人民都必须真心诚意地拥护党的领导，坚决反对任何削弱和反对党的领导的言论和行动。在这次整风运动中，有些民族主义者向党的领导大肆进攻，说什么“共产党是汉人党，不能代表少数民族人民的利益”，“没有共产党，也能得到民族繁荣”等，这都是极端反动的。共产党的领导是建设社会主义的决定条件，民族主义者的向党进攻目的在于企图搞垮党的领导，以便实现资本主义复辟。但是共产党在各民族的广大人民中有着很深刻的信仰，民族主义者的阴谋只是像“蚍蜉撼大树”一样，必然会遭到完全的粉碎。
      真正能够代表各民族利益的只有大公无私的共产主义者。
    党的领导力量的强大在于党的团结和统一。列宁曾经说过：“无产阶级之能够成为而且必然会成为不可战胜的力量，就只是因为它由马克思主义原则所造成的思想统一，有组织的物质统一把它巩固起来，这个组织把千百万劳动者团结成为工人阶级的大军。”中国共产党七届四中全会关于增强党的团结的决议中也指出：“党的团结是党的生命，是马克思列宁主义的基本原则。”
    正因为党的团结和统一具有如此重大的意义，所以有些民族主义者居心叵测地用分裂党的团结统一的办法来削弱党的领导。他们说非本民族成分的党员不能为本民族谋幸福，只有本民族的党员才能为本民族谋幸福，这当然是非常错误的。我们从来认为，不管是那个民族，只有大公无私的共产主义者，才能密切地联系广大人民，才能真正代表各民族人民的利益，如果违反共产主义原则，走上破坏国家统一和民族团结的道路，即使是本民族的干部也不可能代表甚至只能损害本民族的利益。解放以来，许多汉族共产党员在少数民族中生根、开花、结果，全心全意地为当地人民服务，同少数民族干部和人民一起，促进了当地社会的发展和民族的繁荣，从而受到少数民族人民的欢迎和爱戴。这难道不是正好说明了这个问题吗？少数民族中的地方民族主义者，向来口口声声以民族利益的代表者自居，经过这次整风运动的揭发，却原来不但不是什么民族利益的代表者，而且都是彻头彻尾地损害民族利益的野心分子，这难道不是从另外一个方面说明了上述的问题吗？
    有些民族主义者还主张按民族成分划分党组织，这更是反动的。党组织的团结统一和干部的共产主义化是党的组织路线的最高原则。过去党曾经提出过干部民族化的口号，它的主要精神是要培养和使用少数民族干部，要求所有的干部包括汉族干部都要深入了解当地实际情况，充分注意民族特点，同当地群众打成一片。本民族的干部在这方面有着很多有利条件，因此党从来就注意培养少数民族干部，在少数民族中发展党员，并且尽可能地选拔少数民族干部参加当地的领导机关，这是完全必要的和正确的。在这方面也是有成绩的。因此决不允许借民族化这个口号来破坏党的团结和统一的原则，更不能允许按民族成分去划分党的组织。
    七届四中全会关于增强党的决议中指出：“破坏党的团结就是违反马克思列宁主义的基本原则，就是帮助敌人来危害党的生命。”党的问题上的民族分裂主义不但是破坏党的团结和统一的最危险的思想，也必然是分裂祖国统一和民族团结的反动思想，必须坚决加以反对。
    综上所述，社会主义立场和民族主义立场的根本分歧，也就是社会主义道路和资本主义道路的根本分歧。必须用社会主义立场克服民族主义立场，用社会主义道路克服资本主义道路，这便是当前各少数民族人民政治、思想革命的伟大任务。
                      （三）
      继续深入地在少数民族中开展整风和社会主义教育运动，坚持把反对地方民族主义的斗争进行到底。
    目前整风和社会主义教育运动，正在各少数民族中蓬勃地向前开展，我们的任务是继续深入地在各少数民族中开展这一运动，坚持把反对地方民族主义的斗争进行到底，争取运动的全胜。各地在运动进行的过程中，需要继续注意以下几个问题：
      （一）必须加强对运动的领导。这次运动既然是一个政治战线和思想战线上的彻底的社会主义革命，这就要求各有关地区的党政领导都具有很大的决心，坚决进行，才能使运动取得彻底的胜利。另一方面，整风和批判地方民族主义是一个很复杂的工作，加之各民族、各地方的情况不同，许多少数民族中党的基础还比较薄弱，一部分少数民族还缺少从本民族培养出来的共产主义骨干，这就要求各地领导上在下定决心的同时，又要注意采取谨慎的态度和妥善的步骤，稳步前进，防止任何简单急躁的作法。同时还应当注意不要把民族感情和民族主义混淆起来，也不要把那些在实际工作中发生的认识上的偏差和某些不自觉的糊涂思想当作民族主义去批判。
      要使广大干部和人民普遍受到一次深入的社会主义教育。要引导各族  人民把爱民族和爱祖国结合起来，把民族繁荣同社会主义道路结合起来。
      （二）要使广大干部和人民普遍受到一次深入的社会主义教育。这次运动首先要在党员和干部中进行，并且要把重心放在党内。要使所有党员和广大的干部都认识到：民族主义立场，不管是大汉族主义立场或者是地方民族主义立场，都是同社会主义、同无产阶级民族观、同马克思列宁主义根本不相容的，都是同各民族团结互助共同建设社会主义的道路相违背的，都是同党的建设的根本原则相违背的，都应当自觉地加以检查和改正。在一切有条件的地区要及时地把运动推广和深入到学校、工厂、农村等各界人民中去，使广大工人、农民、知识分子和宗教职业者等都能受到一次普遍的深入的关于民族问题方面的社会主义教育。在工厂，要使各民族职工进一步懂得加强民族团结和工人阶级团结及其相互关系的重要意义。在农村，要引导各民族农民把爱民族同爱祖国结合起来；把民族繁荣同社会主义道路结合起来。在几个民族联合建立起来的合作社中，还要特别注意改进各民族社员之间的关系。在知识分子中，要进行无产阶级民族观的教育，帮助他们克服资产阶级民族观。在宗教界中，要进行爱国守法和反对坏人坏事的教育，以加强宗教人员的爱国守法观念。同时，在这次运动中，对于散居在内地城、乡中的少数民族人民，除同当地人民一起，由所属地区的有关部门组织进行一般的社会主义教育以外，还要由民族事务部门或者党的统战部门召集他们举行座谈，使他们也能受到一次关于民族问题方面的社会主义教育。
      （三）依靠少数民族骨干。在这次运动中，必须坚决地依靠少数民族中的共产主义骨干去进行工作。同时必须坚决地相信绝大多数群众。各地在进行工作的过程中，都注意到首先在各民族的骨干中间把问题讨论清楚，取得一致的认识，然后再依靠他们去发动本民族的群众。这样作，就能使运动顺利地开展起来。事实证明，少数民族的广大干部和人民都是热诚地拥护党的号召的，并且已经积极地投入了反民族主义的斗争，这是运动必然要取得彻底胜利的一个重要保证。
      汉族党员和干部要认真批判大汉族主义，绝不能因为地方民族主义有了新的滋长而放松对大汉族主义的检查和批判。
      （四）注意整改。过去我们在民族工作中是存在一些缺点和错误的，有些并且还是相当严重的。对于这些缺点和错误，各有关地区的党委和政府机关都要随时注意检查、纠正。并且在运动的一定时期内，还应当根据党中央有关的指示精神，转入以整改为主的阶段，在整改阶段中，应当认真地检查民族政策的执行情况，坚决、彻底地改正各地在工作中所存在的缺点和错误，特别要注意切实解决一些当地人民迫切需要而且有条件解决的问题。绝不能因为批判地方民族主义和其他情况，放松了对工作中缺点、错误的改正。只有这样，才能进一步争取和团结各民族中那些中间状态的群众，彻底孤立地方民族主义者，并使我们的民族工作提高一步。任何掩盖错误，企图逃避整改的错误作法，都必须严格防止和纠正。
      （五）汉族党员和干部要认真地批判大汉族主义。在自治地方内的汉族居民、汉族党员和汉族干部中，整风和社会主义教育都要按照党中央对汉族地区的要求去进行。汉族党员和
  干部更加应当认真地检查和批评大汉族主义，有些地方大汉族主义相当严重，尤应着重检查和批判。绝不能因为地方民族主义有了新的滋长而放松对大汉族主义的检查和批判。现在发现有一些汉族干部不注意检查自己存在的大汉族主义思想，有的甚至借机抵抗党的民族平等政策，这些都是非常错误的，必须坚决加以纠正。只有这样，才有利于在汉族人民中彻底贯彻民族平等的思想，也才有利于在少数民族中克服地方民族主义。汉族党员、干部和少数民族党员、干部在一起进行整风，是可以而且应该互相批评的，但是都要注意着重对本民族中的民族主义思想进行批判，都要注意避免发生民族间相互对立的现象，以便达到既辨明是非，又增强团结的目的。
      党的民族政策和宗教信仰自由政策丝毫不容怀疑，必须坚决贯彻执行。
    在这里需要说明的是有些人因为看到少数民族中的地方民族主义滋长，就怀疑党的民族政策的正确性，甚至认为在今后就可以不再继续推行民族区域自治政策了，不再注意照顾民族特点和民族风俗习惯了，不再注意培养少数民族干部了。这当然都是极其错误的。党的民族政策是根据马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的学说结合我国的实际而制定的，几年来的民族工作的伟大成就完全证明了这个政策的正确。只要稍微注意一下在祖国的统一和各民族团结的事业中已经得到的胜利，也只要注意一下各少数民族在短短的几年中已经得到的政治、经济和文化的发展，就丝毫也不能怀疑党的民族政策的正确。地方民族主义的滋长，是资产阶级对社会主义进行挣扎和反抗的一种表现，这是社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争中必然要出现的一种现象。只要注意一下我国当前阶级变动的情况，也就丝毫不能怀疑党的政策。党的民族平等政策包括反对民族主义在内是一项长期的政策，无论在什么时候都必须坚决贯彻实行，任何不认真执行这个政策的作法都是不能容许的。
    还有些人因为看到少数民族中的一些反动的上层和宗教职业者进行反社会主义的活动，就怀疑党对上层的统一战线政策和宗教信仰自由政策是否有必要继续执行，这也是很错误的。在这次整风运动中，确实有一些民族上层和宗教上层向党、向人民进行了恶毒的攻击。他们反党、反社会主义、破坏祖国统一和民族团结的阴谋活动，激起了各民族人民极大的愤慨和严肃的反右派斗争，这是完全应该的。各民族中的资产阶级右派分子都是人民的敌人，如果对他们不进行坚决的斗争，使之在广大人民中完全孤立起来，就很不利于各民族建设社会主义，也很不利于各民族的发展和繁荣。这方面的任何右倾思想都必须坚决反对。但是必须看到，这样的反动分子在全国少数民族的上层和宗教职业者中毕竟只占少数，大多数的民族上层和宗教上层几年来在党和政府的团结教育下，都是有程度不同的进步的。他们中间有很多人在不同的工作岗位上作了不少的工作，已经成为国家干部的一部分。在民族上层和宗教上层中间虽然有不少人对社会主义还存在着不同程度的抵触情绪和错误言行，这些都必须进行批评教育，但他们的问题，仍然是属于人民内部的问题，和右派分子有着根本的不同。可见怀疑党的统一战线政策是否有继续实行的必要，是没有根据的。党在今后仍然要以毛主席的六项标准作为政治基础继续实行对上层人士的统一战线政策，继续团结和改造一切可以团结、改造的人。各少数民族的上层人士都必须拥护共产党的领导，拥护社会主义，维护祖国的统一和团结，并且加强对自己的改造。参加工作的上层人士，是否参加劳动锻炼，可以在自愿的基础上，根据自己的身体情况和其他条件决定，不要勉强。至于怀疑党的信教自由政策是否有必要继续实行，更是没有根据的。共产党人对人民的宗教信仰只能实行这个政策，而不能实行别的什么政策。而且宗教信仰自由政策是一个长期的政策，只要人民信仰宗教，我们就实行这个政策。但是宗教界必须爱国守法，绝不能允许利用信教自由，进行反社会主义的反动活动。应该特别指出，少数民族宗教界违反爱国守法准则的坏人坏事是很不少的，因此就必须在这次运动中，对宗教界进行爱国守法和反对坏人坏事的教育。不这样，就不但不利于巩固社会主义制度和民族间的团结统一，不利于贯彻信教自由政策，对于宗教界本身也是很不利的。
                    （四）
      只有在各民族中形成了真正具有无产阶级觉悟的共产主义核心，才能克服本民族的资产阶级民族主义倾向，巩固民族团结。培养少数民族共产主义的干部是彻底解决民族问题的一个重要关键。
    从这次整风运动的情况看来，少数民族的党员和干部绝大多数是好的，但是也有不少的人存在着民族主义和其他资产阶级思想，还有不少的人分不清社会主义立场和资本主义立场，尤其分不清社会主义立场和民族主义立场。这是由于少数民族的党员和干部大都是解放后参加党和参加工作的，有许多人并且是各种剥削阶级家庭出身的，一般还缺少马克思列宁主义的阶级教育和阶级斗争的锻炼，也缺少无产阶级民族观的教育和反对地方民族主义倾向斗争的锻炼，因而有不少的人在思想上有的甚至是在立场上存在着许多问题。这种情况向我们提出了这样一个严重的政治任务，就是如何进一步加强培养少数民族出身的共产主义干部的任务。毛主席在1949年就曾指示我们说：“要彻底解决民族问题，完全孤立民族反动派，没有大批少数民族出身的共产主义干部是不可能的。”邓小平同志在1957年关于整风运动的报告中也指出：“只有在各民族中形成了真正具有无产阶级觉悟的共产主义核心，才能克服本民族的资产阶级民族主义倾向，巩固民族间的团结统一。”可见培养少数民族共产主义的干部是彻底解决民族问题的一个重要关键，如果忽视这个问题，就必然要使我们的工作受到很大的损害。过去几年来，党在培养少数民族的共产主义干部方面做了许多工作，收到了一定的成绩。但是这方面的工作还远远赶不上形势发展的需要。不但少数民族共产主义干部的数量很不够，而且在质量上也很需要提高。为了进一步巩固祖国的统一和民族团结，并且把社会主义革命进行到底，必须大大加强培养少数民族共产主义干部的工作，使各少数民族中都有足够的经得起风险的共产主义的骨干。为此，就要坚决克服过去在对干部的政治、思想工作中所存在的缺点，要对少数民族的广大干部着重进行马克思列宁主义的阶级教育，使他们懂得无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的伟大历史意义；懂得过渡时期阶级斗争的规律性。要求他们真正树立起无产阶级的立场，掌握无产阶级的阶级观点，学会无产阶级的分析方法。只有这样，才能在任何复杂的情况下，不至迷失方向。而坚持地为革命事业奋斗到底。
      少数民族干部要共产主义化，使各民族干部中都有足够的经得起风险的骨干。
    为了使干部共产主义化，还必须结合这次反地方民族主义，向广大的少数民族干部着重进行无产阶级民族观的教育。使他们懂得无产阶级不剥削任何人，而且为争取一个没有剥削的社会制度而斗争，因此它坚决反对民族压迫，主张各民族彻底平等；它坚决反对资产阶级分裂各民族工人阶级、劳动人民的企图，主张各民族工人阶级、劳动人民巩固地联合起来；它坚决反对资产阶级阻碍各民族人民的接近，而主张不断增进各民族人民间的友谊，并且认为各民族将来都要逐步走向世界大同。少数民族的干部必须树立起上述的无产阶级民族观，坚决反对任何民族主义的表现，只有这样，才能坚定地为民族间的团结、统一而不懈地奋斗。
    为了使干部共产主义化，还必须对少数民族干部加强群众观点和劳动观点的教育。使他们真正懂得全心全意为人民服务、相信群众、依靠群众和向群众学习，是一切革命者必须具备的品质。要求他们密切和群众联系，克服任何轻视和脱离群众的思想作风。使他们真正懂得劳动创造世界、劳动光荣和每个革命干部都必须在生产劳动中得到锻炼的道理。只有建立了群众观点和劳动观点，并在工作和生活中体现了这些观点，才能真正地和群众打成一片。
      每个少数民族干部都应作促进派，生气勃勃地在各个战线上奋勇前进。
    为了使干部共产主义化，还必须加强关于提高革命干劲的教育。今天全国人民伟大的奋斗目标是在今后十五年内，把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，并且在钢铁及其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。在国内民族问题方面，也要在今后十五年内，帮助各少数民族得到巨大的发展。不但使各民族都过渡到社会主义社会，并且在经济和文化上，使那些原来和汉族相差不远的民族都能赶上或接近汉族的水平，使那些原来和汉族相差很远的民族，也能得到显著的发展。为了完成这样极其英雄豪迈的事业，我国各民族人民和干部必须以雄壮的革命志气，昂扬的革命干劲，充沛的劳动热情，排除万难，不遗余力地进行生产和工作。要使少数民族的干部都懂得：每个革命的干部都应当作促进派，生气勃勃地在各个战线上奋勇前进，支持和促进一切新生事物的发展；应当反对那种缺乏朝气、强调困难和特殊、对新鲜事物采取消极态度的促退派。要求各民族的干部充分发挥革命的英雄主义，克服一切消极因素。只有这样，少数民族地区建设社会主义的事业才能蓬勃地发展。
    整风和批判地方民族主义的斗争，对各民族干部是一次极生动的无产阶级的阶级教育和民族观教育。坚持民族主义的立场就不能过社会主义关。
    应该认识，无产阶级的阶级观点是马克思列宁主义思想的基础，只有基本上奠定了这个基础，才能解决其他问题。而进行马克思列宁主义民族观点、群众观点、劳动观点和革命英雄主义的教育，又是确立无产阶级的阶级观点所必须的。对少数民族干部进行马克思列宁主义观点的教育，就是要求少数民族干部最后树立马克思列宁主义的世界观和人生观，为共产主义事业而奋斗到底。
    这次整风和批判地方民族主义的斗争，对各民族的干部是一次极其生动的无产阶级的阶级教育和民族观教育。必须指出，资产阶级的民族主义是同无产阶级的世界观根本不能相容的。有民族主义思想的人，不但在阶级观点、群众观点、劳动观点上存在有缺陷，而且革命干劲也很不足。不但往往同时具有个人主义，而且还往往同时具有宗派主义。值得指出的是，一个人用民族主义的观点去看待革命问题，也很容易堕落成为修正主义者。可见，如果有比较严重的民族主义思想的人，不在这次运动中彻底地检查和改正错误，不树立起马克思列宁主义的阶级观和民族观，而仍然坚持民族主义的立场，就不能过社会主义这一关。即使那些有一些民族主义思想的人，尤其是领导干部，也应当勇于引火烧身，进行自我批评，使自己获得锻炼。批评和自我批评，是共产主义者和一切革命干部自我改造的锋利武器，少数民族的同志都应当学会勇敢地和正确地使用这个武器。
                      （五）
    经过几个月来的整风和社会主义教育，经过对地方民族主义的初步批判，在许多少数民族地方已经收到了显著的效果。广大少数民族干部和人民的阶级觉悟提高了，各民族之间的友谊增进了。由于端正了思想认识，在工作和生产中也出现了空前未有的极其生动活泼的新气象。如新疆维吾尔自治区原计划今年要扩大灌溉面积二百万亩，比去年多70％，但在社会主义教育运动的推动和鼓舞下，群众的劲头更大，这个计划很快就被突破了，预计还要增加六十多万亩；内蒙古自治区今年兴修水利的计划，在群众社会主义积极性高涨的情况下，也已由原订的二百零四万亩修改为三百万亩；而在即将建立的广西僮族自治区，去冬今春兴修水利即可扩大灌溉面积一千一百万亩，比过去八年的总和还超出许多。还有许多民族自治地方也都鼓起革命干劲，制定了农、牧业生产大跃进的计划，并积极领导群众掀起生产高潮，开始实现这些计划。这就再一次证明，在少数民族中进行整风和反对民族主义的社会主义教育运动，是完全必要的和完全正确的。它不仅深刻地改变着人们的政治思想面貌，而且还大大地改变着各方面的生产面貌。
    现在整风和社会主义教育运动正在全国少数民族中普遍深入地向前开展，我们坚决相信经过这次伟大的运动，各民族团结统一的事业和建设社会主义的事业都必将获得巨大的跃进。
    让我们高举起战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的光辉旗帜，在祖国的社会主义建设高潮中奋勇前进！
