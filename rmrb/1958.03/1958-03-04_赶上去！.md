    The green clear signal lit up. The extra-heavy and long train we were pulling was about to pass through this last small station and reach its destination. I could no longer suppress the excitement in my heart, and I raised my hand and sounded the advance whistle loudly, then shouted at the top of my voice: "The clear signal is good!" The driver and the stoker also responded quickly: "Good!" The three of us looked at each other and couldn't help but chuckle knowingly. The breath that had been held in our hearts for more than a month was finally exhaled today as if a heavy burden had been lifted.

    Speaking of this worry, we were really ashamed to face anyone. More than a month ago, when the Great Leap Forward in our area was just beginning to show its edge, some locomotive teams increased their planned coal-saving figures threefold at once, and some even set out extra-heavy plans to haul an extra thousand tons. Our locomotive team shouted even louder: "Hang on as much as you want, we'll pull it." I was confident in other aspects, but I was really a little hesitant about this extra-heavy load. But then I thought, a locomotive team has three shifts, how could we be so unlucky as to be caught at the very beginning? Since everyone else agreed, why should I be a camel in a flock of sheep? Let's see how the other two shifts pull it!

    But who knew that the next day when we went to the station to hook up the train, the stationmaster ran over with a smile and said, "I heard you said you'll pull as much as we hang on, we mobilized the loading and unloading workers to rush to load ten cars for you, that's about five hundred tons, consider it you firing the first shot!"

    I was stunned when I heard this, staring wide-eyed in fear, looking at our driver. His face was also red, and he looked at me and then at the stoker, and asked in a low voice, "What do we do?" When I saw him like this, I was even more unsure. Although some locomotive teams had already pulled so many tons, we were not as good as them. First, our car is old and broken, can its power be as great as the new domestic locomotives? Besides, none of the three of us are over twenty-five years old, and the driver is newly promoted, how much experience does he have? If we really can't pull it and leave it halfway, causing an accident, we'd really be in deep trouble! So I asked our driver in return: "What do you say?" "Never pulled that much before!" He shook his head while clicking his tongue. "Then why don't we take a look first and not show off!" They both agreed with my suggestion, so I jumped off the train and said to the stationmaster: "Sorry, not today!" "Don't mess around, get ready!" The stationmaster was about to leave, and I stopped him and said seriously: "No, it really won't work!" The stationmaster's face changed instantly when he saw that we really weren't going to pull it, and he asked: "Didn't you say you could pull as much as we hang on?" "Yes, but it's windy today!" The stoker, Little Zhao, also jumped down to help, it would have been better if he hadn't said anything, but saying that exposed us even more. The wind that day couldn't even move a strand of hair! I quickly took over and said: "Saying it's windy is just joking with you, the coal is really bad, don't believe me, come up and take a look, it's all fines."

    No matter how much we explained, the stationmaster wouldn't listen, and he turned his head and left angrily, muttering as he walked: "Looks like you're just street performers, all talk and no action. If everyone was like you, building socialism would have to wait until the sun rises in the west."

    When this train returned, as soon as the train entered the section, the guys in our group surrounded us. This one asked us why we didn't pull it? That one said we lost face for the group. Our driver was even angrier. He said: "Everyone is running forward in the Great Leap Forward, but you are acting as deserters. If I had known this, I wouldn't have agreed to let you discuss it that day, alright? Pull out the shit and then sit back on it yourself, what's the point!"

    Back in the dormitory, some good friends also asked me why I didn't pull it? It really left me speechless and unable to answer. Are they right! "Since you've never pulled it, how do you know you can't pull it?" "How can others pull it but you can't?" "If you're not sure, won't you learn from those who have pulled it before?"

    The comrades in the group were dissatisfied, and the comrades in the section had opinions. This matter of ours had simply become everyone's topic of conversation.

    We were really regretful at the time, and we didn't dare to raise our heads when we saw people, and we wanted to burrow into a mouse hole. Seeing those slogans of "Learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, surpass the advanced and be even more advanced," we also felt that they were mocking us. The word "promote retreat" could be used on us, it wouldn't work if we didn't put out real effort! The three of us are all young people, and none of us are people who don't know how to strive for excellence. Who is willing to be a backward example? Compared to enthusiasm, who are we afraid of? So we got together whenever we had nothing to do, and inspected ourselves for three full days, severely inspecting and criticizing our conservative thinking, lack of enthusiasm, and small-footed woman-like attitude towards work, and took the initiative to write a self-criticism and guarantee conditions and post them on the section's propaganda board.

    This day we ran a night train and came back. We had just finished taking a bath and were preparing to eat something and go home to sleep when we heard that another extra-heavy train had been put together. I thought: What you hear is ultimately not as good as what you experience yourself, why don't we go and see how others operate. When I said this, they were both extremely happy, praising: "Brilliant plan, brilliant plan." So the three of us rushed to the station again, forgetting all about being hungry, tired, and sleepy.

    Seeing that others were not having much difficulty doing it, I boldly took over and tried to fire a section of the furnace; the driver also tried to drive a few stations. We did a great job, and we were so happy that we couldn't close our mouths. It was even more joyful than marrying a wife. Thinking about how we didn't dare to pull more a few days ago, we really laughed at ourselves for being too worried.

    That day we found this one, begged that one, and insisted on asking them to put together a train for us. We nagged for several days, and finally caught up with one on the first day of the lunar new year. This train not only greatly exceeded the prescribed traction tonnage, but also set the highest record in our section.

    Three hours before departure, we boarded the locomotive. I oiled it well, the driver checked the train well, the stoker cleaned the furnace well, and then we checked each other again, until we thought everything was satisfactory, then we sat down to rest, conserve our energy, and wait for this battle.

    The moment of departure arrived, and the whistle blew a long blast, like a charge horn, and the three of us immediately plunged into a tense battle. To avoid sweating, I simply took off my fleece jacket out of spite, leaving only a shirt, and picked up the shovel and threw the coal into the furnace one shovel at a time like a flower gun.

    The locomotive seemed to be very understanding, and its power was exceptionally greater than usual, and it kept rushing forward, and soon it was pulling this big train and running fast.

    The flames in the furnace rolled out fiercely, and I was still sweating a little from the heat. After filling the coal, I looked at the steam meter and the water meter, and the pointers were all pointing at the red line of the set pressure. "Steam at set pressure, standard water level," I shouted and climbed onto the car door to cool off. The white smoke spewing out of the chimney rose slowly into the sky, it was truly a calm and peaceful good weather that could never be found again. On the flat ground, I saw that there were many farmers wearing new clothes digging ditches by the side of the road, they had also broken the routine to celebrate the Spring Festival. Seeing us driving by, they all stopped working, and many people kept waving to us, some pointing and looking, probably marveling at us pulling such a long train. I also raised my left hand, waving and pointing to the back, meaning: "Let's compare our revolutionary enthusiasm!"

### 赶上去！

    赶上去！
      邯郸市铁路机务段副司机　杨振昆
    绿色的通过信号亮了，我们拉的这趟超轴长大列车，就要通过这最后一个小站到达目的地了。我无法再压抑住内心兴奋的激动，扬手狠狠地拉响了进站预告汽笛，然后咧开嗓门地喊道：“通过信号好咧！”司机和司炉也疾声地应答了一声：“好咧！”我们三个人你看我，我看你的忍不住都会心地嘿嘿笑起来。一个多月憋闷在心里的这口气，今天才算如释重担似的吁出来了。
    说起这块心病，真让我们惭愧的见不得人。一个多月前，在我们这个地区，生产大跃进还是初露锋芒的时候，有的机车组把计划节煤数字一家伙提高了三倍，有的竟订出了能多拉一千吨的超轴计划。我们机车组喊的更响：“给我们挂多少就拉多少。”对于别的方面我都有信心，惟独对这个超轴，说实在的心里真有点犯嘀咕，不过当时我想一个机车组是三班人，哪儿就那么巧，头一开始便让我们赶上了呢？大伙儿既然都同意了，我干嘛羊群里出骆驼哇，看看别的两班拉的怎么样再说呗！
    可是谁知第二天我们到车站一挂车，站长就笑嘻嘻的跑来了，说：“听说你们挂多少拉多少，我们动员了装卸工友给你们抢装了十辆车、也就五百来吨吧，算让你们开这头一炮！”
    我当时一听就愣住了，惶恐地瞪直了眼，望着我们司机。他脸也红了，探询地瞅瞅我，又瞅瞅司炉，低声问：“怎么样？”我一看他这样心里更没底了。虽说有的机车组已经多拉过这么些吨了，可我们不比人家呀，一则我们是老破车，劲头能有人家使的新国产机车劲头大吗？再说我们哥三连一个超过二十五岁的也没有，司机又是新提升的，哪有多少经验哪，真要拉不动撂半道上造成事故，那可就真是吃不了兜着走啦！所以我又反问我们司机：“你说呢？”“没拉过呀！”他啧着嘴直摇头。“那干脆咱们还是看看再说，先别逞这个能吧！”他们俩都同意我这个意见，于是我跳下车跟站长说：“对不起，今天不行啊！”“别逗了，快准备吧！”站长要走，我拦住他一本正经的说：“不，真是不行啊！”站长一看我们当真不拉，脸色登时就变了，问道：“不是你们说能挂多少拉多少吗？”“是啊，今天有风啊！”司炉小赵也跳下来帮腔，他不说还好，一说倒更泄了底，那天的风连头发丝也刮不动呢！我赶快接过来说：“说风大是跟你闹着玩、煤不好是真的，不信你上车看看，全是末子。”
    再怎么解释站长也不听了，生气地扭头便走了，边走还边嘟囔着：“赶情是天桥的把式，光说不练哪，要都像你们这样，社会主义建成得等太阳从西边出来。”
    这趟车跑回来，车刚开进段，我们小组的哥儿们就把我们围上了。这个问我们为什么不拉？那个说给小组丢了人，我们司机长火更大，他说：“大跃进人家都往前跑，可你们却当逃兵，早知道这个，那天讨论你们别同意好不好？拉出屎再自己坐回去，何苦来呢！”
    回到宿舍，一块相好的几个朋友也问我怎么不拉？真是问得我张口结舌无言答对。人家问的对吗！“既然没拉过，你怎么就知道拉不动呢？”“人家怎么能拉你们不能拉？”“心里没底不会跟人家拉过的学学去吗？”
    小组的同志们不满意，段上的同志们有意见，我们这件事简直成了大伙儿的谈话材料了。
    我们当时真是悔恨极了，见人都不敢抬头，恨不能钻进耗子洞里去。看见那些“学先进、赶先进、超过先进更先进”的标语，也觉着它在讥笑我们。“促退”这个词儿算对我们使上了，不拿出真正的干劲算不行啦！我们三个人都是年青人，都不是不知要强的人，谁甘心做落后典型呢？比起干劲我们怕谁？于是我们没事就凑在一块，足足检查了三天，把我们那种保守思想、干劲不大、小脚女人似的对待工作的态度狠狠地进行了检查和批判，主动写了份检讨书和保证条件贴在段宣传牌上。
    这天我们跑了一夜车回来，刚洗完澡准备吃点饭回家睡觉，听说又编了一列超轴列车。我想：听到的究竟不如亲身体会的好，我们何不跟着去看看人家是怎样操作的。我一说他们俩都高兴的不得了，连称：“妙计、妙计。”于是我们三人又奔了车站，什么饿呀、累呀、困呀，全忘在脖子后头了。
    看着人家干的并不怎么费难，我也就大胆地接过来试着烧一段火；司机也试着开几站，干的满好，乐的我们嘴怎么也闭不上了，比娶了媳妇还高兴，想起前几天竟没敢多拉，真是耻笑自己那种顾虑实在有点太多余了。
    当天我们就找这个、求那个的非要求给我们编一列不可。直磨姑了好几天，阴历大年初一才算逮上了，这列车不但大大地超过了规定牵引吨数，而且在我们这个区段也是最高纪录。
    离开车前三小时我们就登上了机车，我把油给好，司机把车检查好，司炉把炉清好，完了我们又互相检查了一遍，直到认为全可心了，才坐下来休息，养精蓄锐、等待这场战斗。
    发车的时刻到了，汽笛一声长鸣，就像响起了冲锋号一样，我们三个人立刻投入了紧张的战斗。为了怕出汗我睹气地干脆连绒衣也脱掉了，只剩一件衬衣，拿起铁锹像使一杆花枪一样，一锹一锹地把煤扔进炉里。
    机车似乎也很通人情，劲头分外比每天大，一个劲的往前窜，不大会儿就牵着这大列车飞跑起来。
    炉火熊熊的往外翻卷，烧的我还是有点冒汗，填完煤我看了看汽表，水表，指针都指在定压的红线上。“蒸汽定压、标准水位”我呼唤了一声就爬在车门上乘凉。烟筒喷出的白烟，袅袅地升上天空，真是再也找不出的风平浪静的好天气。在一马平川的大地上，我看见了道旁有不少农民全穿着新衣服在挖渠，他们也打破常规来过春节了。看见我们驶过来，他们都停止了工作，不少人向我们不断招手，有的在指手画脚地看，大约在为我们拉这么长大的列车感到惊奇。我也举动起左手，边摇边指向后面，意思是说：“咱们比比革命的干劲吧！”
