Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The Fifth Enlarged Meeting of the Nationalities Committee of the First National People's Congress was held. The central topic of this meeting was to conduct rectification and socialist education among minority nationalities. Sixty members, ninety minority nationality representatives to the National People's Congress, and more than eight hundred staff members from the Nationalities Affairs Commission and other relevant central departments participated in the meeting.

During the meeting, Wang Feng, Vice Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, delivered a report on the issue of conducting rectification and socialist education among minority nationalities (the full text of the report will be published in this newspaper). The participating members and people's representatives, in conjunction with the situation in their respective regions, conducted discussions and unanimously agreed that in the current rectification movement in minority nationality areas, the struggle against local nationalism should be resolutely carried out to further consolidate the unity and solidarity of the socialist motherland.

At the end of the meeting, Xie Fumin (Zhuang nationality), Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Nationalities Committee, made a concluding speech. He first pointed out: It is necessary to resolutely rely on the communist backbone elements among the minority nationalities under the leadership of the Party, resolutely believe in the majority of the masses, resolutely strive to unite those in the middle state, criticize all right-leaning thoughts, eliminate all ideological obstacles, and carry out the rectification and socialist education movement to the end.

Xie Fumin emphasized in his speech that it is necessary to consolidate the great unity of all nationalities with the Han nationality as the center. He said that a prominent manifestation of local nationalism is the refusal to recognize the advanced nature of the Han nationality, the unwelcomeness of the help from the Han nationality, and the unwillingness to learn from the Han nationality. Some right-wing elements among the minority nationalities are even stirring up trouble on this issue, openly inciting opposition to Han cadres and Han people, rejecting Han help, and opposing learning from the Han nationality. Such erroneous ideas must be criticized, and the reactionary behavior of those bourgeois right-wing elements must be resolutely打击 (daji – to strike). To build our country into a great socialist power and to enable all nationalities to achieve common development and prosperity, it is necessary to continuously strengthen the mutual assistance and cooperation among all nationalities in our country with the Han nationality as the center, and to work together and make progress together. The Han nationality is the main force in the revolutionary and construction cause of our country and the center of unity of all nationalities in our country. To do a good job in the great unity of all nationalities in our country with the Han nationality as the center and to continuously improve the relationship between minority nationalities and the Han nationality is the fundamental task of our country in solving the nationality issue.

Xie Fumin said: Today's Han nationality is the Han nationality led by the working class and its political party, the Communist Party of China. It has the responsibility and obligation to help all nationalities in the country achieve development and progress. At the same time, it also needs to obtain all possible help and support from minority nationalities and learn all useful things from minority nationalities. But mainly, minority nationalities should learn from the Han nationality and obtain the help of the Han nationality. This is a major issue related to the socialist construction, development, and prosperity of all minority nationalities.

Finally, Xie Fumin elaborated on how to correctly treat the customs and habits of nationalities. He said that in the customs and habits of every nationality, there are some beneficial components that are conducive to socialism and the development of the nationality, which must be promoted. There are some components that have little impact on socialism and national development, which can be left alone. And there are some harmful components that are not conducive to socialism and national development, and the masses should be educated to recognize their harmful effects and gradually change them on the basis of the masses' consciousness.

This meeting lasted for three days and closed on the afternoon of February 13.

    汉族为中心　各族大团结
    各民族委员在人大民族委员会扩大会议上表示决心
    坚决同地方民族主义作斗争进一步巩固祖国的统一
    据新华社28日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会民族委员会举行第五次扩大会议。这次会议是以在少数民族中进行整风和社会主义教育为中心议题。参加会议的有六十位委员，九十位全国人民代表大会的少数民族代表，以及民族事务委员会和中央其他有关部门的工作人员共八百多人。
    会议期间，民族事务委员会副主任汪锋作了关于在少数民族中进行整风和社会主义教育问题的报告（报告全文将在本报发表）。参加会议的委员、人民代表，结合本地区的情况进行了讨论，一致认为在当前少数民族地区的整风运动中，应该坚决进行反对地方民族主义的斗争，进一步巩固社会主义祖国大家庭的统一和团结。
    会议最后由全国人民代表大会民族委员会副主任委员谢扶民（僮族）作总结发言。他首先指出：必须在党的领导之下，坚决依靠少数民族中的共产主义骨干，坚决相信群众中的大多数，坚决争取团结那些中间状态的人们，批判一切右倾思想，扫除一切思想障碍，把整风和社会主义教育运动进行到底。
    谢扶民在发言中强调指出，要巩固以汉族为中心的民族大团结。他说，地方民族主义的一个突出表现，就是不承认汉族先进，不欢迎汉族的帮助，不愿意向汉族学习。一些少数民族中的右派分子更是在这个问题上兴风作浪，公开煽动反对汉族干部和汉族人民，拒绝汉族的帮助，反对向汉族学习。对于这种错误思想必须进行批判，对于那些资产阶级右派分子的反动行为必须坚决给予打击。要将我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义强国，要使各民族得到共同的发展和繁荣，就必须不断加强以汉族为中心的我国各民族之间的团结互助，共同努力，共同进步。汉族是我国革命和建设事业的主力军，是我国各民族团结的中心，搞好以汉族为中心的我国各民族间的大团结，不断改进少数民族和汉族之间的关系，是我国在解决民族问题方面的根本任务。
    谢扶民说：今天的汉族，是在工人阶级及其政党中国共产党领导之下的汉族，它有责任和义务帮助国内各民族获得发展和进步，同时也需要从少数民族方面取得一切可能取得的帮助和支持，向少数民族学习一切有益的东西。但是主要的，还是少数民族应当向汉族学习，和取得汉族的帮助，这是关系到各少数民族建设社会主义和发展、繁荣的重大问题。
    最后，谢扶民对如何正确对待民族的风俗习惯问题，作了阐述。他说，每一个民族的风俗习惯中，都有一部分是有利于社会主义、有利于民族发展的有益的成分，必须予以发扬，有一部分是对社会主义和民族发展没有多大影响的成分，可以不去管它；还有一部分是不利于社会主义、不利于民族发展的有害的成分，则应该教育群众认识它的危害作用，在群众自觉的基础上，逐步加以改变。
    这次会议历时三天，在2月13日下午闭幕。
