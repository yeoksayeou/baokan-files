Such a "Free World"

　　Grumbling Loses a Job
　　According to the American magazine "Time," James McGurke, a teacher in Depew, New York, was dismissed because he wrote the following on the teaching schedule he submitted to the school authorities: "Total teaching hours per week: average 60 hours. Overtime pay: none. Time off for overtime work: none. Salary: meager. Rewards: none. Thoughts: disgust."

　　No Freedom of Marriage
　　According to the South African "New Age" weekly, Ian Silver, a white teacher in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, was recently expelled by the local colonial government because he was in love with a black woman and they were preparing to get married.

　　Pug Club
　　According to a recent report in the French newspaper "L'Aurore," pugs in Paris also have their own clubs. It is said that only noble dogs weighing less than 600 grams, with slender figures, and "elegant" manners can join this "noble" "French Pug Club." When it was first established, it even held a grand banquet to celebrate. Many famous dogs were invited to the banquet, including Bubetta, a small Mexican female dog who had won prizes three times at the Beauty Conference. Mr. Dubar, chairman of the dog club, rose to speak amidst the crisp barking of the dog guests, saying: "Gathering small dogs of petite stature and excellent breed in an elegant club is to maintain the habit of dogs being an indispensable accessory for noble ladies."

　　A World of Robbers
　　According to a recent issue of "Newsweek," the situation in Utica, a city in New York State, is as follows: gangsters are rampant. Prostitutes operate under the protection of the police. Brothels and gambling dens run by gang leaders are everywhere. Gangsters are not only acquainted with the police, but also with local dignitaries. This is the main base for gangster activities in the eastern part of the United States, and these activities even extend to Cuba. Infighting and mutual killings among gangsters over the distribution of loot occur frequently. This city is ruled behind the scenes by a habitual offender named Joseph Falcone. His position is far more important than that of local dignitaries. Not long ago, under pressure from the local masses, the New York State Police raided a meeting of the heads of an Italian-American international gangster group and investigated the aforementioned Italian Falcone. However, Falcone invoked the provisions of the U.S. Constitution at the hearing and refused to answer any questions about his crimes, so the investigation yielded no results, and the gang leader is still at large.

    如此“自由世界”
    发牢骚丢了饭碗
    据美国“时代”周刊报道，詹姆士·麦古尔是纽约州德皮乌市的一位教师，由于他在交给校方授课时间表上写上：“每周上课总时数：平均六十小时。加班工资：无。因加班工作给假：无。薪水：微薄。奖励：无。感想：厌恶。”结果受到撤职处分。
      没有婚姻自由
    据南非“新世纪”周刊报道，南罗得西亚萨尔斯巴利城有一个白种人教师依安·席维尔，最近因为和一名黑种妇女恋爱，两人准备结婚，因而被当地殖民政府驱逐出境。
        叭儿狗俱乐部
    据法国“震旦报”最近报道，巴黎的叭儿狗也有它们的俱乐部。据说，只有体重不到六百克、身材苗条，举止“高雅”的名贵的狗，才能加入这个“高贵”的“法兰西叭儿狗俱乐部。”它刚成立时，居然还大摆盛宴庆祝。应邀赴宴的有许多出过风头的小狗，其中一只墨西哥的小雌狗布贝塔，曾经三次在赛美大会上得过奖。狗俱乐部主席杜巴先生在狗来宾清脆的吠叫声中起立致词说：“把身材娇小、品种优良的小狗团聚在高雅的俱乐部里，是为了保持狗是高贵太太们的必不可少的附属品的习惯。”
      强盗天下
    据最近一期“新闻周刊”报道美国纽约州的一个城市犹地加的黑幕情况说：这个城市匪徒横行。这里的妓女在警察的庇护下营业。由匪徒首脑们经营的妓院同赌窟遍地林立。匪徒不仅与警察结识，而且还与当地的显要结识。这里是美国东半部强盗活动的大本营，这些强盗活动甚至远及古巴。匪徒之间为了分脏引起的内讧和相互残杀的事件层出不穷。这个城市是由一个名叫约瑟夫·法尔康尼的惯匪在幕后统治着。他的地位远比当地的显要人物重要。不久以前，在当地群众压力下，纽约州警察局袭击了一个意大利—美国国际强盗集团的首脑们召开的会议，并且对上述的意大利人法尔康尼进行了调查。但是法尔康尼在调查会上援引美国宪法条文，拒绝答复向他提出的一切有关他的罪行的问题，因此调查没有结果，现在这个匪首仍然逍遥法外。
