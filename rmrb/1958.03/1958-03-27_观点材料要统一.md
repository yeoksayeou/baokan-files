Editor's Note

    Viewpoints and Materials Must Be Unified
    Some of our comrades have a bad habit. Whether giving reports, writing articles, holding meetings, or making speeches, they often separate materials from viewpoints. Sometimes there are materials but no viewpoints, and it's unclear what they are advocating or opposing; sometimes there are viewpoints but no materials, which appears empty and unsubstantial. This is indeed a very bad method.
    We advocate the unity of materials and viewpoints: using solid materials to illustrate viewpoints, and using clear viewpoints to command materials. Without materials, viewpoints lack persuasiveness; without viewpoints, materials similarly lose their vitality. However, achieving the unity of viewpoints and materials is not easy; it is a matter of the unity of theory and practice, of being both "red" and "expert." It requires long-term effort and diligent study: learning both political theory and technical skills, so that one is both a true politician and an expert proficient in their field.
    The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department's plan for cadres to study the Great Leap Forward emphasizes this point. The plan states:
    "It is advocated that whether holding meetings, discussing work, writing articles, or making reports, there should be both viewpoints and materials, both theory and practice." We hope all cadres will make such efforts.

### 观点材料要统一

    观点材料要统一
    我们有些同志，有种不好的习气，不论作报告、写文章、开会、发言，常常把材料和观点割裂开来，有时有材料没有观点，不知道在提倡什么，反对什么；有时有观点又没有材料，显得空洞无物。这的确是一种很坏的方法。
    我们主张材料和观点的统一。用确凿的材料去说明观点，又要用明确的观点去统率材料。没有材料，观点就缺乏说服力，没有观点，材料同样会失去生命。而要做到观点和材料的统一，并不那么轻而易举，这是理论和实践统一的问题，红与专的问题。必须作长期的努力和刻苦的学习。既学政治理论，又学技术业务，使自己既是名副其实的政治家，又是精通业务的专家。
    广东省委宣传部关于干部学习大跃进的规划中就着重提到了这一点，规划中说：
    “提倡无论开会、谈工作、写文章、做报告，都要有观点也有材料，有理论也有实际。”愿所有的干部都作这样的努力。
