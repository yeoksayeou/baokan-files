    Automated Pig Slaughterhouse

    A large-scale automated meat processing plant—the Wuhan Meat Processing Complex—officially went into production on the 10th.

    In this factory, when the groups of live pigs are sent to the electrical anesthesia station, they are anesthetized by electric current, killed with a sharp knife, and then automatically rolled into a pool for scalding. After being scraped by machine, the meat and internal organs are separated, and then the limbs are sawn open with an electric saw and sent to the cold storage. By-products are sent to various sections such as casings, oils and fats, bristles, and blood meal to be processed into various products. The entire factory can slaughter 4,000 pigs in one eight-hour shift, averaging one pig every 7.2 seconds. After the entire factory reaches its production capacity, it can produce 400 tons of fresh and frozen meat per day, enough for 800,000 people to eat for a month. If 30% of the pork produced by this factory annually is exported, it can earn 125,000 tons of steel annually.

    自动化宰猪厂
    一座大型的自动化肉类联合加工厂——武汉肉类联合加工厂，10日正式投入生产。
    在这座工厂里，成群的生猪一送上麻电台，就被电流麻醉，用尖刀杀死，再自动滚入池中烫洗，经机器刮毛，把肉和内脏分开，然后再将肢体用电锯剖开送入冷藏库，副产品送到肠衣、油脂、猪鬃、血粉等各工段加工为各种产品。全厂一班八小时能宰杀四千头猪，平均七点二秒钟一头。全厂发挥生产能力后，可日产鲜肉和冻肉四百吨，够八十万人吃一个月。如果以这个厂每年生产的猪肉有30％出口计算，每年可换回钢材十二万五千吨。
