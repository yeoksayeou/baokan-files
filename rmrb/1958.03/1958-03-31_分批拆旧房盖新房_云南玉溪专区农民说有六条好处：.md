Demolishing Old Houses in Batches to Build New Houses
Farmers in Yuxi Prefecture, Yunnan, Say There Are Six Benefits:
Opening up sources of fertilizer, expanding arable land, guaranteeing increased production, eliminating the Four Pests, improving living standards, and establishing a new socialist countryside
    
    This newspaper's Kunming dispatch on the 26th: In the Yuxi Prefecture of Yunnan Province, many new residences have emerged in the upsurge of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, and the living conditions of about 10% of the commune members have improved.
    
    In the vast rural areas of Jiangchuan, Yimen, Huaning, Jinning, and other counties in Yuxi Prefecture, the living conditions of ordinary farmers are very poor, with about 20% to 30% of the houses dilapidated. In the upsurge of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, they systematically demolished some of the old houses in batches and adopted the method of residents providing bricks, tiles, and wood, while the agricultural cooperatives provided labor. Under the unified planning of the cooperative, many new houses were built, and the demolished old wall soil was used as fertilizer. In some places, the vacated land was also converted into paddy fields. Yimen County has already demolished more than 2,000 old houses, and will continue to demolish 20% to 30% of the old houses this year; within three to five years, some of the villages near the mountainous areas will be moved up the mountains. In Jinning County, more than ten natural villages have either merged with nearby villages or moved up the mountains, which not only improved the living conditions of the commune members, but also expanded the cultivated land by more than 1,300 mu. The masses of Gucheng Township in the county summarized six benefits of this practice: (1) It opened up sources of fertilizer; (2) It expanded the area of cultivated land; (3) It is conducive to increased agricultural production; (4) It is conducive to the elimination of the Four Pests; (5) Commune members moved into new houses; (6) It established a new socialist countryside.
    
    Demolishing old houses to build new houses is originally a good thing, but some people say, "A golden nest is not as good as my thatched nest." Others say, "A home cannot be moved casually, it is not in accordance with Feng Shui, and people will suffer." The masses in Xiaozhai Township, Jinning County, were also worried that the new houses would not be as good as the old houses; that there would be no place to keep chickens, ducks, cattle, and horses; that the new neighbors would not be easy to get along with; and that things would be lost when moving. In response to these concerns, the Party branch and the agricultural cooperative in Xiaozhai Township proposed: No demolition of houses without thorough ideological work, no moving. Therefore, they organized the masses to conduct a great airing of views, a great debate, and a debate on the planning of the new socialist countryside. At the same time, they organized the masses to visit the newly built houses. When the commune members saw that the newly built houses were strong, hygienic, and convenient, they were overjoyed. Some commune members in Chengjiang County moved their homes on the first day of the Lunar New Year, driving livestock and carrying things. Jihua Agricultural Cooperative has greened the new residential area; many newly moved commune members have also planted flowers and plants in their courtyards. (Qin Junguang) (Attached picture)

    分批拆旧房盖新房
    云南玉溪专区农民说有六条好处：
    开辟肥源　扩大耕地　保证增产　消灭四害　改善生活　建立新农村
    本报昆明26日电　云南省玉溪专区在兴修水利和积肥运动中，出现了很多新住宅，约有10％的社员居住条件有了改善。
    玉溪专区的江川、易门、华宁、晋宁等县的广大农村，一般农民的居住条件很不好，约有20％至30％的住房破烂不堪。在兴修水利和积肥运动中，他们有计划地分批拆除了一部分旧房，并采取由住户出砖瓦、木料，农业社出人工的办法，在社的统一规划下，盖了很多新住宅，同时把拆除的老墙土作肥料；有些地方还把腾出的土地改为水田。易门县已经拆除旧房两千多间，今年还要继续拆除20％至30％的旧房；在三五年内，要把一部分靠近山区的平坝村庄搬上山。晋宁县有十多个自然村，有的同附近的村庄合并了，有的搬上了山，不但改善了社员的居住条件，还扩大了耕地一千三百多亩。该县古城乡群众总结了这种做法的六条好处：（一）开辟了肥源；（二）扩大了耕地面积；（三）有利于农业增产；（四）有利于消灭四害；（五）社员住进了新房；（六）建立了社会主义新农村。
    拆除旧房盖新房，本来是件好事情，可是也有人说：“金窝银窝不如我的茅草窝”。还有的说：“家不能随便搬，不合风水，人要遭灾的”。晋宁县小寨乡的群众还耽心新房没有老房好；怕鸡鸭牛马无处放；怕新邻居不好处；搬家丢东西等等。针对这些顾虑，小寨乡的党支部和农业社提出：不搞透思想不拆房，不搬家。于是，他们组织群众大鸣大放大辩论，辩论社会主义新农村的规划。同时组织群众参观新盖的住宅。当社员们看到新盖的房子又坚固又卫生又方便的时候，都喜得合不拢嘴。澄江县有些社员，大年初一就赶着牲口挑着东西搬了家。吉花农业社绿化了新的住宅区；许多新搬家的社员还在庭院里栽上了花草。　　　（秦军光）（附图片）
