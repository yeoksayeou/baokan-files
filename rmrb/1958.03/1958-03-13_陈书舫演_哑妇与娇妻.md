Chen Shufang Performs in "The Mute Wife and the Spoiled Wife"

The Sichuan opera stars Chen Shufang and Zeng Ronghua's modern drama "The Mute Wife and the Spoiled Wife," performed in Chongqing City in early March, was well-received. Factory and mine workers immediately suggested that they go to factories and mines to perform.

"The Mute Wife and the Spoiled Wife" is one of the representative works of the late Sichuan opera playwright Liu Huaixu. The play mainly tells the story of the different paths taken by two sisters in a family: the mute elder sister, Li Bingrong, finally obtains a happy family because of her diligence and kindness; the younger sister, Li Xuerong, is a vain and materialistic modern woman who marries several husbands and ultimately becomes a victim of the old society. This play exposes and criticizes the depravity and corruption of bourgeois life to a certain extent, and also praises the kind and simple qualities of the working people.

    陈书舫演“哑妇与娇妻”
    川剧名演员陈书舫、曾荣华3月初在重庆市上演的现代剧“哑妇与娇妻”，受到欢迎。厂矿职工马上提意见要求他们到厂矿去演出。
    “哑妇与娇妻”是已故的川剧剧作家刘怀绪的代表剧作之一。戏的内容主要是通过一个家庭中两姐妹所走的不同道路：哑巴姐姐黎冰容因为勤劳善良，终于获得一个幸福的家庭；妹妹黎雪容是个崇拜虚荣的摩登小姐，嫁了好几个丈夫，最后成了旧社会的牺牲品。这出戏对资产阶级生活的堕落腐化作了一定程度的揭露和鞭挞，同时也歌颂了劳动人民善良纯朴的品质。
