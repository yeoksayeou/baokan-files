Inside the Door, a Harsh Winter; Outside the Door, Spring
Wu Wei

    "Rectification behind closed doors" is, in itself, a violation of the spirit of rectification. One of the unhealthy tendencies we want to rectify is detachment from reality and detachment from the masses. Some institutions keep cadres locked up at home for rectification, believing that the more rectification takes place, the busier they become, the less they step out of the institution's doors, and the more they neglect contact with all aspects and the broad masses. As a result, they drill into the dead end of detachment from reality and detachment from the masses, digging deeper and deeper; like Antaeus losing his mighty strength when separated from the earth, rectification cannot be done well, and work also cannot be done well.

    The Henan Water Conservancy Bureau originally "rectified behind closed doors," and right-leaning ideas could not be rectified. The 1958 Great Leap Forward plan was discussed for more than half a month, and it still could not be finalized; the survey and design of more than two hundred medium-sized water conservancy projects and nine large-scale water conservancy projects requiring approval could not be started. The Henan Provincial Party Committee instructed them to first rectify the unhealthy tendency of "rectification behind closed doors," which was detached from reality and detached from the masses. Three bureau chiefs led all the cadres of the bureau in two batches to delve into the key work areas of water conservancy construction, learning from the peasants on the one hand and helping the peasants summarize their experiences on the other, while launching an anti-waste and anti-conservatism rectification movement on the spot. Once combined with reality and combined with the masses, the rectification movement immediately became active, and a gust of spring breeze dispersed the right-leaning conservative ideas of many people. The task of surveying and designing, which was originally thought to take five years to complete, could now be guaranteed to be completed in one year; the cement problem, which was originally considered unsolvable, was also readily solved.

    What are the benefits of rectifying by going out the door, going into practice, and going among the masses? The experience of the Henan Water Conservancy Bureau is that, first, the revolutionary drive of the masses is a good medicine for curing right-leaning conservative ideas; second, the wisdom of the masses is a living textbook for improving work and improving technology.

    Now is a golden age of spring all over the land, and the flowers of the Great Leap Forward, diligently cultivated by the broad masses, are blooming everywhere in a riot of color. Comrades who are always cooped up in the office "rectifying behind closed doors" should quickly open the windows, open the doors, walk out of the office, delve into the masses of their own institutions, walk out of the institution's doors, throw themselves into the leaping ranks of the broad masses, and get involved in the "spring plowing movement" of all walks of life!

    "Open-door rectification" will give new impetus to those institutions that are "rectifying behind closed doors." Inside the door, a harsh winter; outside the door, spring. This is the thought-provoking enlightenment that the Henan Water Conservancy Bureau's "open-door rectification" gives us.

    门内严冬门外春
    吴韦
    “关门整风”本来就违反整风精神。我们要整掉的歪风之一，就是脱离实际脱离群众。有的机关把干部关在家里整风，认为越整风越忙，越迈不出机关的大门，越整风越荒疏了和各方面的联系，荒疏了和广大群众的联系。结果，就钻进脱离实际脱离群众的牛角尖，越钻越深；像安泰脱离了大地一样，失掉了雄伟的力量，整风整不好，工作也作不好。
    河南水利厅原来“关门整风”，右倾思想整不掉，1958年的跃进计划讨论半个多月，一直订不下来；需要审批的二百多个中型水利工程和九个大型水利工程的勘测和设计，无法开步走。河南省委指示他们首先整掉“关门整风”这股脱离实际脱离群众的歪风。三个厅长率领全厅干部，先后分两批深入水利建设的重点工区，一面向农民学习，一面帮助农民总结经验，同时就地开展反浪费反保守的整风运动。一和实际结合，一和群众结合，整风运动就马上活跃起来，一阵春风吹散了很多人的右倾保守思想，原来认为要五年才能完成的勘测和设计的任务，也可以在一年中保证完成；原来认为无法解决的水泥问题也迎刃而解。
    出门整风，到实际中到群众中去整风，究竟有什么好处呢？河南水利厅的经验，第一，就是群众的革命干劲，是医治右倾保守思想的良药；第二，就是群众的智慧，是改进工作改进技术的活的教科书。
    现在已是遍地春光的黄金时代，广大群众辛勤培植的大跃进的花朵，万紫千红，处处盛开。老是闷在办公室里“关门整风”的同志们，应该快快开开窗户，开开房门，走出办公室，深入本机关的群众中去，走出机关大门，投入广大群众的跃进行列，卷入各行各业的“春耕运动”中去！
    “开门整风”，将会使那些“关门整风”的机关得到新的动力。门内严冬门外春，这就是河南水利厅“开门整风”给我们的引人深思的启示。
