To Thoroughly Change the Arid Face of the Plateau
Gansu and Qinghai Will Build Eight Large Canals
(Our newspaper's report) The people of Gansu are full of ambition and vow to divert the rolling waters of the Tao River and Datong River, tributaries of the Yellow River, onto the central and eastern Loess Plateau, which is more than 2,000 meters above sea level, to irrigate 16 million mu of arid land. This struggle will begin soon and will strive to be completed within two and a half years.

These two canals run through mountains more than 2,000 meters above sea level, like suspended canals. Sometimes it runs on the top of the mountain, sometimes it dives into the belly of the mountain; sometimes it crosses deep gullies and rivers in the air, and in some places, half of the mountain has to be split open with large explosions; some depressions also require manual labor to raise the mountain. Building such a large canal in the mountains has never happened in China's history.

On this Loess Plateau, the 27 counties in the central part are the most arid areas in the country, truly deserving the name "nine droughts in ten years."

In recent years, under the leadership of the local Party organizations, the farmers here have used every bit of water from the sky, ground, and underground, and have increased the irrigated area by 2.42 million mu in a few years. One hundred and fifty townships have already changed their arid appearance.

After the completion of the Tao River and Datong River irrigation project, the arid face of the arid areas in central Gansu will be fundamentally changed, and the grain output in the irrigated area will increase by one to two or three times.

The manpower, materials, and financial resources required for these two construction projects are considerable, but the farmers in Gansu did not ask the state to do it, but mainly relied on themselves. At present, a warm wave of fundraising has been set off in the rural areas of eastern and central Gansu. At present, the amount of fundraising reported by people in various places has reached more than 110 million yuan, and more than 30 million yuan has been turned over. This reported fundraising figure is more than five times larger than the state's investment in Gansu's water conservancy this year. A construction team of hundreds of thousands of people will be composed of farmers. At present, the survey work has been completed, and the measurement design is being done.

Also, the Gansu Daily published an editorial on March 4 entitled "Hard Work for Three Years, Happiness for Ten Thousand Years" on the two large-scale mountainous irrigation canal projects of the Tao River and Datong River.

The editorial said: The construction of these two giant canals is undoubtedly a fundamental measure to completely change the arid face of the province, and it is also an important guarantee for "three years of hard work to basically change the face of Gansu." If this battle is won, coupled with the water conservancy projects being built in various places, the whole province can be formed into a complete water conservancy system, thereby laying the foundation for greening, electrification, and promoting the great leap forward of industry and agriculture. At that time, the arid areas will jump over the grain production increase target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), and Gansu will become a new grain, cotton, and oil base in the motherland.

The editorial said that these two canals are more than 1,000 kilometers long, which is longer than China's Grand Canal; the irrigation area is larger than the irrigation area of Dujiangyan in Sichuan Province, the largest in China. Such a huge water conservancy project was only a dream in the old society, and now it will be built in our hands, and it will mainly rely on the people's own manpower, materials, and financial resources to build.

The editorial finally called on all working cadres and all the people of the province to fully mobilize from all aspects to vigorously support in order to win this decisive battle to change the arid face of the province and ensure the early completion of the two giant canal projects of the Tao River and Datong River.

(Our newspaper's report) Qinghai Plateau will build six large canals to fundamentally change the arid face of the plateau. More than 700 survey personnel from the Qinghai Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau have arrived at the construction site of the six major canals to design the alignment of the main canals, three of which will be constructed in the summer and autumn of this year. The main canals of the six major canals are more than 3,000 kilometers long in total and are planned to be completed successively from 1959 to 1961. They can irrigate 9.2 million mu of farmland, which is one-quarter more than the province's existing cultivated land; they can also use 160,000 kilowatts of hydropower, providing conditions for agricultural mechanization and rural electrification in Qinghai Province.

Five of the six major canals are in agricultural areas, mainly diverting the Datong River from the northern foot of the Daban Mountain, a branch of the Qilian Mountains, to the south of the mountain. The other Chaka Canal is in the agro-pastoral transitional area, running through the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. In addition to irrigating a large area of newly reclaimed land, it can also irrigate 1.6 million mu of grassland.

The five major canals in the agricultural area are built by farmers of all ethnic groups, with state investment subsidies and technical guidance; the Chaka Canal is mainly built by state hired workers.

### 彻底改变高原干旱面貌  甘肃、青海将兴建八条大水渠

    彻底改变高原干旱面貌
    甘肃、青海将兴建八条大水渠
    本报讯　甘肃人民满怀壮志，立誓要把波浪滚滚的黄河支流——洮河和大通河的水，引上拔海两千多公尺的中部、东部黄土高原，灌溉一千六百万亩干旱土地。这场斗争不久就要开始，争取在两年半内完成。
    这两条渠道走行在拔海两千公尺的万山丛中，犹如一条悬空的运河。它有时走行在山顶，有时钻进山肚子里；有时凌空跨过深沟大河，有的地方要用大爆破方法把半个山劈开；有的凹洼地区还要用人工把山加高。在山上修建这样大的渠道，在我国历史上没有过。
    在这块黄土高原上，中部二十七个县又是全国干旱区中最干旱的地区，真是名副其实的“十年九旱。”
    最近几年，这里的农民在当地党组织领导下，把天上、地上、地下每一点点水源都利用起来，几年增加了二百四十二万亩水地，已经有一百五十个乡改变了干旱面貌。
    引洮河和大通河灌溉工程完工后，甘肃中部干旱地区的干旱面貌将根本改变，灌区内的粮食产量将增加一倍到二、三倍。
    这两个建设工程所需要的人力、物力、财力是很多的，但甘肃农民并没有要求国家来办，主要依靠自己。目前甘肃东部、中部农村已经掀起一个热烈的积资热潮。现在各地人民自报集资的数量已达一亿一千多万元，上交款已有三千多万元。这个上报的集资数字比国家今年对甘肃水利的投资大五倍还多。一支数十万人的施工队伍将由农民组成。目前勘察工作已经完成，正在做测量设计。
    又讯　甘肃日报在3月4日就洮河和大通河的两条大型山区灌溉渠道的工程发表了题为“苦战三年幸福万年”的社论。
    社论说：这两项巨型渠道的兴建，无疑是彻底改变本省干旱面貌的根本措施，也是“苦战三年，基本改变甘肃面貌”的重要保证。这一仗打胜了，加上各地正在兴修的水利工程，就能把全省构成一个完整的水利系统，从而为绿化、电气化和推动工农业大跃进奠定基础。到那时，干旱地区将跃过全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中所规定的粮食增产指标，甘肃将成为祖国新的粮棉和油料基地。
    社论说，这两条渠道全长一千多公里，比我国的运河还要长；灌溉面积，比我国最大的四川省都江堰的灌溉面积还要大的多。这样巨大的水利工程，在旧社会里只是梦想，现在就要在我们手里修成，而且主要将是依靠群众自己的人力、物力、财力去兴建。
    社论最后号召全省工作干部和全体人民，为了打胜这一改变本省干旱面貌的决定性的战役，应全体总动员，从各方面去大力支援，确保洮河、大通河这两条巨型渠道工程早日竣工。
    本报讯　青海高原将兴建六大水渠，从根本上改变高原的干旱面貌。青海省水利局的七百多名勘测人员，已经到达六大水渠的工地，作干渠定线设计，其中三条将在今年夏秋季施工。六大水渠的干渠，共长三千多公里，计划在1959到1961年先后完工，可以灌溉农田九百二十万亩，比全省现有耕地多四分之一；还可以利用水力发电十六万瓩，为青海省农业机械化和农村电气化提供条件。
    六大水渠有五条在农业区，主要是把大通河从祁连山支脉大板山的北麓改道流至山南。另一条茶卡渠在农牧业交错地区，纵贯海南藏族自治州和海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州，除灌溉大片新开垦的土地外，还可以灌溉一百六十万亩草原。
    农业区五大渠都由各族农民自修，国家投资补助和进行技术指导；茶卡渠主要由国家雇工修建。
