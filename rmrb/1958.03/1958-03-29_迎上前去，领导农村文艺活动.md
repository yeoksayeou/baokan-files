    Stepping Forward to Lead Rural Cultural Activities
    In Mojiang County, Yunnan Province, along with the great leap forward in agricultural production, mass cultural activities are also flourishing, with a hundred flowers blooming and a riot of color. This is an epitome of the current rural mass cultural activities.
    The socialist revolution has liberated the productive forces and also liberated people's minds. The broad masses of workers and peasants are not only striving to leap forward in production, but also demanding a rich cultural life during their intense labor to entertain their bodies and minds; they demand to reflect their lives and promote the progress of life in various artistic forms. Comrades working in rural areas may have different attitudes towards this demand of the peasants: some do not feel it because their thinking lags behind reality; some feel it, but either emphasize the busyness of the central work and have no time to take care of it; or only based on old experience: engaging in cultural activities costs money. Under the pretext of anti-waste, cultural activities are also eliminated. However, the leading comrades of Mojiang County stepped forward in time, leading the masses to solve this problem. The Mojiang County Party Committee changed the method of simply relying on one or two professional troupes to tour among the masses, liberating culture from a narrow scope and allowing it to be lively and vigorous among the broad masses. They pointed out the correct guidelines for rural cultural activities: closely integrate with production and serve production; farmers write and perform their own programs. They also proposed a set of organizational methods: under the leadership of party organizations in various districts and townships, with the Communist Youth League branch, rural clubs, propaganda network, and primary school teachers as the core, active members who love cultural activities are absorbed to participate, and propaganda teams are organized in every township. Therefore, the cultural activities of this county have distinct reality, extensive mass participation, and strong combat effectiveness. The places where they perform are the sites for water management and fertilizer accumulation; most of the programs are based on current reality. The praise of advanced figures and model deeds, as well as the criticism of conservative ideas and backward figures, have immediately had a strong impact on the masses, which has become a good weapon for conducting political and ideological education among the masses, powerfully promoting production, and enriching the cultural and entertainment life of the masses.

    迎上前去，领导农村文艺活动
    云南墨江县随着农业生产的大跃进，群众文艺活动也蓬勃地开展起来，百花怒放，万紫千红，这就是当前农村群众文艺活动的一个缩影。
    社会主义革命解放了生产力，也解放了人们的思想。广大工农群众不但在生产上奋身跃进，同时也要求在紧张的劳动中有丰富的文艺生活，娱乐自己的身心；要求以各种文艺形式来反映自己的生活，推动生活的前进。对农民的这个要求，作农村工作的同志也可能有各种不同的态度：有的由于思想落后于现实而感觉不到；有的虽也感觉到了，或者是强调中心工作繁忙而无暇顾及；或者是只根据旧经验：搞文艺活动就得花钱。借口反浪费把文艺活动也反掉了。但是，墨江县的领导同志却及时地迎上前去，领导群众解决了这个问题。中共墨江县委改变了单纯依靠一两个专业剧团在群众中巡回演出的办法，把文艺从狭小的范围内解放出来，让它生龙活虎地活跃在广大群众中。他们对农村的文艺活动指出了正确的方针：密切结合生产，为生产服务；农民自编自演。还提出了一套组织办法：在各区、乡党组织的领导下，以共青团支部、农村俱乐部、宣传员网和小学教师为核心，吸收爱好文艺活动的积极分子参加，乡乡都组织了宣传队。因此，这个县的文艺活动就具有鲜明的现实性、广泛的群众性和强烈的战斗性。他们演出的地方就是治水、积肥的现场；演出的节目大多取材于当前的现实生活。对先进人物、模范事迹的歌颂以及对保守思想和落后人物的批判，都立即在群众中发生了强烈的影响，这就成了对群众进行政治思想教育的良好武器，有力地推动了生产，也丰富了群众的文化娱乐生活。
