    The Tortuous Process of the Yunnan Dyeing Factory's Production Development Proves:
    The Key Lies in Improving Leadership Style
    Supervising workers' operations from outside of production resulted in a long-term inability to solve the problem of defective products.
    Personally participating in production improved quality and produced a large number of new products.
    Kunming Dispatch from our Newspaper, March 28th: Over two years, Huang Yuhe, the director of the Yunnan Dyeing Factory, and Du Qing, the Party Secretary, specifically helped workers trial-produce 217 new products. This resulted in the value of new products accounting for over 96% of the factory's total production value, with an average first-class product qualification rate of 98.36%, and some even reaching 99.21%. After the new products were released, they were welcomed by people of all nationalities throughout the province and remained in short supply. In terms of improving product quality and reducing costs, this factory also created experiences in overcoming defects such as "green heads," "uneven depth of color at both ends," and "uneven elongation." The Ministry of Textile Industry has designated this factory's experience in solving the "green head" problem as one of the thirteen experiences in the printing and dyeing industry to be promoted nationwide.
    The Yunnan Dyeing Factory's achievements have gone through a tortuous process. Before 1955, they successively produced 450,000 bolts of colored cloth in eight varieties, of which more than 130,000 bolts were defective. For a long time, consumers were unwilling to buy the factory's colored cloth. The factory's employees were also very dissatisfied.
    At the time, factory director Huang Yuhe tried his best to change the backward situation. He and the deputy factory director, the chairman of the trade union, and others divided up the work and supervised workers' operations in the workshops, staying in the workshops for five or six nights each month. At every dispatch meeting and production meeting, he always "criticized and criticized again" and "scolded and scolded again." The employees avoided the factory director when they saw him. Huang Yuhe also thought that the workers and technicians were "naughty" and "not serious in their work." The problem of defective products remained unresolved.
    At the end of 1955, Huang Yuhe decided to change his style, go deep into production, and work with all the factory's employees to completely change the enterprise's backward situation. Huang Yuhe and Du Qing, the newly transferred Party Secretary, tightly grasped the trial production of new products. He himself also served as the leader of the new product trial production team. He participated in every process of the new product trial production from beginning to end. They promoted the experience gained in the trial production of new products to all the workshops in the factory.
    In 1956, a vigorous advanced producer movement unfolded throughout the factory. The workers put forward more than 200 rationalization proposals, of which 104 were adopted. When the factory director and Party Secretary went to the city for meetings, they did not rest at noon but ran to the store, buying small pieces of high-quality printed cloth from other factories. Once, Huang Yuhe listened to a report at the workers' cultural palace. Before the meeting, he classified and counted the colors of the clothes of more than 2,000 people in order to study the masses' preferences. The two technicians sent to Shanghai to study also sent back many samples of printed cloth from Shanghai.
    Huang Yuhe and some workers in the factory also frequently went out to investigate whether the factory's cloth was popular and what the sales situation was like. Whenever there was an opportunity, they carried the trial-produced new products everywhere to promote them. In 1957, they trial-produced more than 170 new products, including more than 100 kinds of ethnic printed cloths made by hand. Each time a new product was trial-produced, the factory director, Party Secretary, and technical workers went to ethnic commodity and trade companies, ethnic colleges, ethnic affairs committees, and counties inhabited by ethnic minorities to solicit opinions. The factory director personally participated in every inspection of the quality of new products. Even for very small quality accidents, he studied and solved them together with the workers. Huang Yuhe spent all his time in the workshop, except when he went to the city for meetings and handled some necessary administrative affairs.
    Currently, all the employees of this factory are competing with the employees of the famous China No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory in Shanghai to catch up with the advanced level of China No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory as soon as possible. (Chen Qin)

    云南漂染厂发展生产的曲折过程证明
    关键在于改进领导作风
    站在生产之外监督工人操作，次品问题长期不能解决
    亲自动手参加生产，提高了质量，制成了大批新产品
    本报昆明28日电　云南漂染厂厂长黄煜和、党委书记杜青在两年当中，具体帮助工人试制了二百一十七个新产品，使这个厂的新产品产值占全厂生产总值的96％以上，新产品的一等品的合格率平均达到98.36％，有的还高达99.21％。新产品出厂以后，受到全省各民族人民的欢迎，始终供不应求。这个厂在提高产品质量、降低成本等方面，还创造了克服“绿头”、“两头深浅不一”和“伸长不一”等缺点的经验。纺织工业部已经把这个厂解决“绿头”的经验，作为印染业十三条经验之一，在全国推广。
    云南漂染厂取得这些成就，经过了一个曲折的过程。1955年以前，他们先后生产了八个品种的四十五万多匹色布，其中次品布就有十三万多匹。很长一个时间，消费者都不愿意买这个厂的色布。厂里的职工也很不满意。
    当时，厂长黄煜和极力想改变落后面貌。他和副厂长、工会主席等人，在车间分兵把口监督工人操作，一个月总有五、六个通夜不离车间。在每次调度会和生产会议上，他总是“批评又批评”，“训斥再训斥”。职工们见了厂长都躲着他走。黄煜和也认为工人和技术人员“调皮”，“工作不认真”。出次品的问题一直没有解决。
    1955年底，黄煜和决定改变作风，深入生产，和全厂职工一起，来彻底改变企业的落后面貌。黄煜和同新调来的党委书记杜青，紧紧地抓住了新产品试制工作。他自己还担任了试制新产品工作组的组长。他从头到尾地参加了试制新产品的每一个工序。他们把试制新产品中取得的经验，在全厂各个车间作了推广。
    1956年，一个轰轰烈烈的先进生产者运动在全厂展开了。工人们共提出了二百多条合理化建议，被采纳的达一百零四条。厂长和党委书记进城开会时，中午不休息就跑到门市部，看到别厂出的质量好的花布，就小块小块地买回来。有一次，黄煜和在工人文化宫听报告，会前，他把二千多人的衣服颜色分类作了统计，以便研究群众的爱好。派往上海学习的两个技术员，也从上海寄回许多种花布的样品。
    黄煜和还和厂里的一些工人经常出外调查，调查本厂的布是否受欢迎、销售情形到底怎样；只要一有机会，他们就背着试制的新产品到处宣传。1957年，他们又试制了一百七十多种新产品，其中有用手工试制的一百多种民族花布。每试制一种新产品，厂长和党委书记、技术工人，就分别到民族商品、贸易公司、民族学院、民族事务委员会及少数民族聚居的县去征求意见。每次检验新产品质量，厂长都亲自参加，那怕是很小的质量事故，他也要同工人一起研究解决。黄煜和除了进城开会和主持处理一些必要的行政事务外，都是蹲在车间里。
    目前，这个厂的全体职工正在同上海著名的中国第一印染厂的职工比干劲，争取很快赶上中国第一印染厂的先进水平。　（陈秦）
