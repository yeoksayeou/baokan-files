Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. In order to strive to achieve the production increase plan of "wheat catching up with rice, and rice doubling," the Suzhou District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the county committees have adopted the method of commanders personally going to the front lines during the war, and have moved their leading organs to the countryside one after another, leading production with the energy of commanding battles.

The Suzhou District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party stipulated that after the leading organs move to the countryside, they should regularly contact an agricultural cooperative, cultivate experimental fields, summarize experiences, and hold on-site meetings to guide the overall situation. The organs generally move to different crop areas, purposefully linking with the business of their departments, accumulating and creating experience in the work of the departments. From responsible cadres to general cadres, everyone should combine with local old farmers to cultivate one mu of experimental field.

In addition to leaving a small number of cadres in the original organs to contact the counties, the Suzhou District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to set up mobile offices. In addition to the unified establishment of small-scale, low-staffed offices for cooperation, agriculture and forestry, finance and trade, and animal husbandry by the District Committee and the Commissioner's Office, all organs have also moved to the countryside.

The Changshu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in addition to requiring the four mobile offices led by the secretaries to strengthen the specific guidance of production by region, also adopted the method of relevant departments contracting one township and relevant cadres contracting one crop or one project, so as to go down with tasks and return with achievements.

    和农民共同筹划生产
    苏州专区各级领导机关搬到农村
    新华社南京26日电　中共江苏省苏州地委和各县委，为了力争实现“三麦赶水稻，水稻翻一翻”的增产规划，采取了战争时期指挥员亲临前线的办法，先后把领导机关搬到农村，用指挥战斗的劲头领导生产。
    中共苏州地委规定领导机关搬下乡后，要经常联系一个农业社、搞试验田、总结经验、开现场会议，以指导全面。各机关一般都是搬到不同的作物区，有目的地联系本部门业务，积累和创造部门工作的经验。从负责干部到一般干部，每人都要与当地老农结合搞一亩试验田。
    中共苏州地委除留下少数干部在原机关联系各县外，决定设立流动办公室。地委和专署除统一设置规模小、人数少的合作、农林水、财贸、畜牧等办公室外，各机关也全部搬下乡。
    中共常熟县委除要求由书记带头组成的四个流动办公室，分片加强对生产的具体指导之外，还采取有关部门分工包干一个乡，有关干部包干一种作物或一个项目的办法，做到带任务下去，带成绩回来。
