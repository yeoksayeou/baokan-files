    National Union Catalog Editing Work Leaps Forward

    This newspaper reports that, encouraged by the National Library Work Conference, the work of the National Union Catalog Editing Group has also recently taken a leap forward. They have proposed: to publish the inaugural issue (combining the first and second issues) of the Union Catalog Bulletin of Western Language Books before June of this year, and to publish four issues annually; to complete the editing of the Union Catalog of Western Language Periodicals (approximately 15,000 titles) by the end of this year; to complete the entire editing of the Union Catalog of Chinese and Japanese Periodicals by the end of 1959; and to begin printing the Union Catalog of Chinese Periodicals successively by the end of this year, arranged in order of Hanyu Pinyin letters.
