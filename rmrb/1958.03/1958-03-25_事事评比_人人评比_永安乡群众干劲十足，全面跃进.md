Comparing Everything, Comparing Everyone
　　Yong'an Township Masses are Full of Vigor, Comprehensively Leaping Forward
　　(Our dispatch) Yong'an Township in Fuyang County, Anhui Province, has adopted the leadership method of "comparing everything, comparing everyone," promoting a comprehensive leap forward in all tasks. This place, located on the Huaibei Plain and prone to either drought or flooding, has a preliminary irrigation network of ditches, ensuring water for converting over 30,000 mu of land to rice cultivation, and also turning 80% of the dry land into irrigable land. This year, the township will surpass the Yangtze River – achieving a per-mu grain yield of 846 jin. The township has accumulated more fertilizer this year than in previous years, managed the summer crops better than in previous years, completed over forty out of the fifty trees per person afforestation task, and has basically achieved "four nos" throughout the township.
　　This township uses the method of comparison for whatever work they do, exchanging experiences and promoting the backward to learn from the advanced. The Xuguang Agricultural Cooperative improved tools, increasing the efficiency of earth transportation in water conservancy construction. The township organized everyone to compare and learn, resulting in a surge of tool improvement throughout the township, basically eliminating carrying by shoulder pole. The average daily work efficiency of earth transportation per person is now above five cubic meters. The Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative and the Jianguang Agricultural Cooperative had good afforestation methods, so a meeting was held to compare and introduce experiences, resulting in neat rows of newly planted trees quickly appearing along the roads and ditches throughout the township. Wangzhuang Production Team of the Jinguang Agricultural Cooperative always came first in every comparison, while the Hou Weijing Production Team always lagged behind. Through comparison, everyone pointed out the conservative thinking of the Hou Weijing Team for not improving earth transportation tools. The Hou Weijing Team accepted everyone's criticism, disassembled the double-wheeled, double-shared plow and used all its parts to transport earth, surpassing the Wangzhuang Team in work efficiency and becoming an advanced production team in the entire cooperative.
　　When comparing various tasks, comparisons are made not only between cooperatives and teams, but also among individuals. Some agricultural cooperatives established honor rolls, while others created charts showing each member's progress. All township cadres who are relieved of production tasks are no exception. Each is assigned to be responsible for a cooperative, competing in policy implementation, leadership methods, and work performance. Township cadre Gao Ziliang used the method of mobilizing members to invest, solving the funding difficulties for purchasing tools needed for converting land to rice cultivation. Wang Chenquan, Fu Liangchen, and others also learned this method.
　　The township's comparison methods are also diverse. In addition to the system of meeting every five days, checking every ten days, and comparing every month, the township's production bulletins are published every other day, reporting the production progress of each agricultural cooperative. Whenever good or bad examples are discovered, everyone is organized to attend "on-site meetings" to compare and exchange experiences and lessons learned.

### 事事评比  人人评比  永安乡群众干劲十足，全面跃进

    事事评比  人人评比
    永安乡群众干劲十足，全面跃进
    本报讯　安徽省阜阳县永安乡采取“事事评比、人人评比”的领导方法，推动了各项工作全面跃进。这个处在淮北平原上的不旱即涝的地方，一个沟渠灌溉网已初步形成，可保证改种三万多亩水稻的用水，又能把80％的旱地变成水浇地。今年这个乡就要跨过长江——亩产粮食八百四十六斤。全乡今年肥料积得比往年多，午季作物管理得比往年好，每人种树五十棵的绿化任务已完成四十多棵，而且全乡已基本实现“四无”。
    这个乡不管做什么工作都运用评比的方法，交流经验，推动落后的向先进看齐。旭光农业社改良工具提高了兴修水利中的运土效率，乡里便组织大家去评比、学习，结果全乡掀起了改良工具的热潮，基本消灭了抬挑的现象，每人每天平均运土工效都在五公方以上。新华农业社和建光农业社的绿化办法好，便开会评比，介绍经验，结果全乡的道路旁、沟渠边，很快就出现了整整齐齐的新种的树木。金光农业社的王庄生产队，每次评比总是第一，而后魏井生产队老是落后，通过评比，大家指出了后魏井队不改良运土工具的保守思想，后魏井队接受大家的批评，把双轮双铧犁的犁头拆下，全部用它来运土，工效赶过了王庄队，成了全社的先进生产队。
    在评比各项工作时，不但社与社、队与队比，而且人人都比。农业社里有的建立光荣榜，有的制出图表，标示出每个社员的劳动进度。全乡的脱产干部也不能例外，他们每人都分工包干一个社，比执行政策、比领导方法、比工作成绩。乡干部高子良用发动社员投资的办法，解决改种水稻需要添置工具的资金困难。王成全和傅良臣等也就学习这个办法。
    这个乡的评比形式也是多种多样的。他们除了有五天一碰头、十天一检查、一月一评比的制度以外，乡里的生产快报每隔一天就公布一次各农业社的生产进度。随时发现好坏典型，就组织大家去开“现场会”，边评比、边交流经验教训。
