    The United States has caught a contagious disease, ① called "economic recession syndrome," with symptoms of dizziness, vomiting, and high fever—declining production and increasing unemployment. The United States sneezes loudly, and the "free world" catches a cold. New York, London, Ottawa... "Prosperous regions" are no longer prosperous. The President personally comes to treat it, talking emptily about "confidence" to calm the nerves, ② and then giving a shot of stimulant, increasing military spending and engaging in war. Quenching thirst with poison to deceive oneself, trying to save one's life will ultimately lead to death. In serious illness, grabbing medicine haphazardly, quack doctors harm people, truly unforgivable!
    Note: ① George Meany, president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), said: "Unemployment in the United States has become a contagious disease."
    ② U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower recently said at the Republican National Women's Conference that he has "full confidence" in the "free economy" of the United States.

    美国得了传染病
    禾君美国得了传染病，①名叫“经济衰退症”，头晕呕吐发高烧——生产下降失业增。美国喷嚏响连声，“自由世界”伤了风，纽约、伦敦、渥太华……“繁荣地区”不繁荣。总统亲自来医治，空谈“信心”压压惊，②然后再打强心针，增加军费搞战争。饮鸩止渴骗自己，要想救命终送命。病重乱把药来抓，庸医害人真不轻！注：①美国劳联—产联主席乔治·米尼说：“美国失业现象
      成了一种传染病”。
    ②美国总统艾森豪威尔最近在美国共和党全国妇女会议
      上说，他对美国的“自由经济”“充满着信心”。
