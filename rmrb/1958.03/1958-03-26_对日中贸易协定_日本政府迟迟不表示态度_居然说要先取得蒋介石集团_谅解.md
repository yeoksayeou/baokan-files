    On the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement
    Japanese Government Delays Expressing its Attitude
    Actually Saying it Must First Obtain "Understanding" from the Chiang Kai-shek Clique
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 25th: Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama told reporters today that the Japanese government sees "no need to rush" to express its official position on the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. He said that the trade agreement would first be studied by relevant cabinet members of the Japanese government, then submitted to a cabinet meeting for discussion, and finally the Japanese government could decide its official attitude towards the trade agreement.
    Prior to this, representatives from the League for the Promotion of Sino-Japanese Trade by Japanese Diet Members, the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and the Japan Export-Import Association met with Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Aiichi Kiichi on the morning of the 24th, submitting to him the text of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and related documents such as memoranda signed by the three groups with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade on March 5th. They also requested Aiichi to urge the Japanese government to express its support for the trade agreement and the memorandum in writing by the 28th of this month.
    The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was warmly welcomed by Japanese public opinion and economic circles after it was signed on March 5th; they urgently demanded that the Japanese government express its support for the agreement and assist in its implementation. On the part of the Japanese government, although Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama had successively stated on March 11th and 14th that they would express the Japanese government's attitude towards the trade agreement in the short term, the Japanese government has repeatedly delayed and has not expressed its attitude even twenty days after the agreement was signed.
    Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Aiichi Kiichi also stated on the 24th that the Japanese government would actually seek the "understanding" of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique in deciding its attitude toward the Sino-Japanese trade agreement. According to Kyodo News, after discussing this issue, the Japanese government will also order its "ambassador" to Taipei, Horiuchi, to conduct "consultations" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

    对日中贸易协定
    日本政府迟迟不表示态度
    居然说要先取得蒋介石集团“谅解”
    据新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本外务相藤山爱一郎今天向记者说，日本政府“没有必要急速”表明它对第四次日中贸易协定的正式立场。他说，这项贸易协定将首先由日本政府的有关阁员进行研究，再提交内阁会议讨论，最后日本政府才能决定它对这项贸易协定的正式态度。
    在此以前，日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟、日本国际贸易促进协会和日本输出入协会三个团体的代表曾经在24日上午会见了日本内阁官房长官爱知揆一，向他提交了三团体在3月5日同中国国际贸易促进委员会签订的第四次日中贸易协定本文以及备忘录等有关文件，并且向爱知提出促使日本政府在本月28日以前用书面表明它支持贸易协定和备忘录的书面要求。
    第四次日中贸易协定在3月5日签订以后，曾经受到日本舆论和经济界人士的热烈欢迎；他们迫切要求日本政府表明它支持这项协定的立场，并且协助贯彻执行这项协定。而在日本政府方面，尽管日本首相岸信介和外务相藤山爱一郎曾经在3月11日和14日，先后表示要在短期内表明日本政府对这项贸易协定的态度，但是，直到目前协定已经签订二十天以后，日本政府始终一再拖延，迟迟没有表明它的态度。
    日本内阁官房长官爱知揆一在24日还表示：日本政府在决定它对日中贸易协定的态度问题上竟然要取得台湾蒋介石集团的“谅解”。据共同社报道，日本政府在讨论这个问题以后，还将命令它的驻台北“大使”堀内同蒋介石集团进行“协商”。
