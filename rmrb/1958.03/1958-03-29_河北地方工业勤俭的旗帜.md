Hebei Daily News: The Baoding Machinery Factory, starting from scratch and working diligently, has grown from a small factory with 84 employees to a medium-sized machinery factory with over 1,000 employees and more than 200 machines in the past nine years. In 1957, the total value of production increased by 16.9 times compared to 1949. This factory has become the banner of Hebei Province in developing local industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

When Baoding was liberated in 1948, this repair shop, located in a dilapidated temple, was almost in ruins, and the 32 old belt lathes were also in disrepair. However, after nine years of hard work and dedication by the employees, production has greatly developed. It is now capable of manufacturing 34 types of products, such as complete sets of cotton ginning equipment (including power and boilers), dyeing equipment, construction machinery and equipment, brick-making machines, large-scale rolling mill equipment components, sprayers, and portable boilers. During the First Five-Year Plan period, this factory also handed over more than 1.78 million yuan in profits and saved more than 330,000 yuan in funds.

Over the past nine years, this factory has consistently adhered to the principle of running enterprises diligently and frugally. The employees have been working hard in dilapidated temples and bamboo sheds, which are generally considered unsuitable for organizing and developing modern production. With the development of national construction projects, the factory has faced new expansion problems every year. When solving these problems, the leading cadres of this factory always tried their best to guide the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the employees onto the path of diligence and frugality, so that the simple factory buildings were fully utilized and the old equipment exerted its greatest potential. For example, in 1950, in order to support agricultural production, waterwheels needed to be produced. Several old machines were transferred in, and the number of employees increased to about 300. The main hall of the original dilapidated temple could not accommodate them. In order to save the country's limited funds, the factory used the east and west side halls of the dilapidated temple as metalworking workshops, tool workshops, and assembly workshops; and only built a simple workshop as a foundry workshop.

For example, when the task of manufacturing sprayers was accepted in 1953, there were no old houses or dilapidated temples available. At that time, the factory adopted the method of building bamboo pole sheds as factory buildings. In 1956, the factory had a new task of producing five-horsepower portable boilers. At that time, there was no place to build new houses. Under such circumstances, it seemed that only the old factory buildings could be demolished or the site relocated to build a new factory. However, the employees, with their hard work and dedication, used bamboo poles to build a canopy in the middle courtyard using the two walls of the two workshops, under the principle of not buying land, not relocating the factory, and using as little or no state money, and also used the small roads in the factory that could be dispensed with to build bamboo sheds, which solved the problem of workshops.

The Baoding Machinery Factory cherishes the country's investment very much, and always tries not to use state investment for non-productive construction, but to use the money on the most needed machinery and equipment for production. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the funds used for purchasing machinery and equipment accounted for 80% of the total investment. Even when purchasing machinery and equipment, they did not proceed from the pursuit of newness, completeness, and spaciousness, but tried every means to tap the potential of existing equipment. For example, in 1955, the factory accepted the task of manufacturing new products, and needed to add grinding machines, boring machines, and heat treatment equipment. The employees worked hard to study and research, used "precision turning" instead of grinding machines, used ordinary lathes instead of boring machines, and used earth furnaces mixed with charcoal instead of heat treatment equipment, which also enabled the product quality and quantity to meet national requirements.

In running the enterprise diligently and frugally, the leading cadres have always shared weal and woe with the employees. The party secretary and the factory director lived in dilapidated and small private houses just like the workers. In 1955, forty new dormitories were built, which were also for employees who lacked housing. The factory has not relaxed its concern for the lives of employees, and has carried out various employee welfare programs. The factory's principle of running welfare is "not to seek beauty and elegance, but to strive to spend less money and solve practical problems." Now the factory has welfare and cultural and recreational facilities such as a daycare center, a tuberculosis isolation room, an amateur sanatorium, a library, and a club.

In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, some leading cadres and employees were complacent and believed that their factory was frugal enough and there was nothing to oppose. However, tens of thousands of big-character posters exposed the waste and conservative phenomena in the enterprise, further opening up a broad path for running the enterprise diligently and frugally. Now, this factory has formulated a leap forward plan under the condition of not adding people or equipment, to complete three or four years of tasks this year, and the total output value this year should increase three times compared to last year, and ensure the completion of the task of manufacturing 4,000 portable boilers.

    河北地方工业勤俭的旗帜
    本报讯　河北日报消息：保定机械厂因陋就简刻苦起家，九年来由原有八十四名职工的小工厂，发展到拥有一千多名职工和二百多台机器设备的中型机械厂，1957年的生产总值比1949年提高了十六点九倍。这个工厂已经成为河北省多快好省地兴办地方工业的旗帜。
    1948年保定解放时，这个设在破庙中的修械所已经近似废墟，三十二台老皮带车床也是七零八落。但是，经过职工们九年的苦干苦钻，生产有了很大的发展。现在已经能够制造三十四种产品，如全套的轧花厂设备（包括动力和锅炉）、染厂设备、建筑机械和器材、制砖机、大型轧钢设备部件、喷雾器、锅驼机等。第一个五年计划期间，这个工厂还上缴了利润一百七十八万多元，节约资金三十三万多元。
    九年来，这个工厂始终坚持了勤俭办企业的原则。职工们一直在一般人认为不能组织和发展现代化生产的破庙和竹棚中苦干苦钻。随着国家各项建设事业的发展，工厂年年面临扩建的新问题。在解决这些问题的时候，这个工厂的领导干部总是千方百计地把职工群众的革命积极性和创造性引上克勤克俭的道路，使简陋的厂房得到了充分的利用，使破旧的设备发挥了最大的潜力。例如1950年为了支援农业生产，需要生产水车，调来了几台旧机器，职工也增加到三百来人，原有的破庙的正殿容纳不下了。为了节约国家有限的资金，这个工厂利用破庙的东西两个配殿作为金工车间、工具车间、装配车间；只新建一个简易工房作为铸工车间。
    又如1953年接受制造喷雾器的任务时，已经没有旧房或破庙可以利用了。当时，工厂采取了建竹竿棚子作为厂房的办法。1956年，工厂又有了生产五马力锅驼机的新任务。当时连盖新房的地方都没有。在这种情况下，好像只有拆掉旧厂房或迁移地址另建新厂了。但是，职工们用苦干苦钻的劲头，在不购地不迁厂和少用或不用国家的钱的原则下，利用两个车间的两面墙，在中间院子上用竹竿架起了天棚，还利用厂内可以不用的小马路兴建了竹棚子，解决了工房的问题。
    保定机械厂十分珍贵国家的投资，总是尽量不把国家投资用于非生产性建设，而把钱用在生产上最需要的机器设备上。第一个五年计划期间，全厂用在购买机器设备上的资金占投资数的80％。就是购买机器设备时，也不是从求新求全求宽绰出发，而是千方百计地挖掘现有设备潜力。例如1955年工厂接受了制造新产品的任务，需要增添磨床、镗床和热处理设备。职工们刻苦钻研，用“精车”代替磨床，用普通车床代替镗床，用地炉掺炭代替热处理设备，同样使产品质量和数量达到了国家要求。
    在勤俭办企业中，领导干部一直与职工群众同甘共苦。党委书记、厂长和工人一样地租破旧矮小的民房居住。1955年新建了四十间宿舍，也是让缺房的职工住。工厂更没有放松对职工生活的关怀，举办了多种多样的职工福利事业。这个工厂办福利的原则是“不求美观漂亮，力求少花钱又能解决实际问题”。现在厂里已经有日间托儿所、肺病隔离室、业余疗养室、图书室、俱乐部等福利和文化娱乐设施。
    在反浪费反保守运动中，某些领导干部和职工有自满情绪，认为自己的工厂已经够勤俭了，没有什么浪费可反。但是成千上万张大字报揭发了企业中的浪费和保守现象，进一步打开了勤俭办企业的广阔道路。现在，这个工厂在不添人不添设备的条件下，制订了跃进计划，要在今年完成三年或四年的任务，今年的总产值要比去年增三番，保证完成制造锅驼机四千台的任务。
