No U.S. Pollution of the Pacific!
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, held not long ago, suggested that the people of Asian and African countries take joint action on March 1 to stop the United States from conducting nuclear weapons explosion tests on Eniwetok Island in the Pacific, scheduled to begin in April. This suggestion fully reflects the common aspirations of the people of Asian and African countries, and it will undoubtedly inspire new vigor in the people of Asian and African countries to safeguard peace. The Japanese people held a national rally on March 1 for the Asian-African People's Joint Action to Stop the Eniwetok Island Hydrogen Bomb Test.

    For several years, the United States has disregarded the strong opposition of world public opinion, brazenly violated international regulations on the freedom of the high seas, arbitrarily delineated vast "restricted areas" in the Pacific Ocean, and conducted nuclear weapons explosion tests. According to official U.S. figures alone, the United States has conducted as many as eighteen nuclear weapons tests on Bikini and Eniwetok Islands in the Pacific since 1946. These tests have brought direct disasters and threats to the people of countries in the Pacific region. The Japanese Fukuryu Maru incident is a tragedy that can never be forgotten. At the same time, these tests have greatly aggravated the tense situation in the Pacific region and threatened peace in the region. Therefore, the people of countries in the Pacific region have long resolutely opposed this practice by the United States. Nearly half of the people in Japan have signed petitions calling for a ban on nuclear weapons testing. Recently, the Japanese government formally sent a note to the United States, requesting a halt to nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific. Indian Prime Minister Nehru has also repeatedly called for a halt to such tests. His remarks on establishing a nuclear-free zone in Asia have received widespread attention. In other Asian and African countries, and even in Australia, similar calls are constantly being made.

    However, the United States has repeatedly used various pretexts to reject the Soviet Union's proposal to stop nuclear weapons tests. These so-called "reasons" are not worth refuting in the first place. Now, Harold Stassen, the former Special Assistant to the President for Disarmament, after being forced to resign due to disagreements with the U.S. authorities on disarmament issues, has revealed the truth, further proving that the U.S. opposition to stopping nuclear weapons tests is completely unreasonable.

    We, the people of Asian and African countries, are determined to stand with the people of all countries in the world and resolutely oppose the U.S.'s criminal activities of preparing for nuclear weapons war. We should take joint action, first to stop the United States from conducting nuclear weapons tests on Eniwetok Island, scheduled to begin in April, and then to turn the Pacific Ocean into a truly peaceful ocean!

    不许美国污染太平洋！
    本报评论员
    不久以前召开的亚非人民团结大会建议亚非各国人民在3月1日采取共同行动，以阻止美国预定从4月起在太平洋上的恩纳威托克岛进行的核武器爆炸试验。这个建议完全反映了亚非各国人民的共同愿望，它无疑地会鼓起亚非各国人民维护和平的新的干劲。日本人民已于1日举行了亚非人民共同行动制止恩纳威托克岛氢弹试验全国大会。
    几年来美国就一直不顾世界舆论的强烈反对，悍然违犯关于公海自由的国际法规，任意在太平洋上划定广阔的“禁区”，进行核武器爆炸试验。仅据美国官方公布的数字，美国从1946年开始到现在为止，在太平洋上的比基尼、恩纳威托克岛上的核武器试验就达十八次之多。这些试验已经给太平洋区域各国人民带来了切身的灾害和威胁。日本的福龙丸事件就是一个永远也不能令人忘记的悲剧。同时，这些试验更大大地加重了太平洋区域的紧张局势，威胁了这个地区的和平。因此，太平洋区域各国人民很早以来就坚决反对美国的这种做法。日本人民在禁止核武器试验的呼吁书上签名的已近全国人民的半数。最近日本政府又正式照会美国，要求停止在太平洋上进行核武器试验。印度总理尼赫鲁也曾经再三地呼吁停止这种试验。他的关于建立亚洲无原子区的言论更受到广泛的重视。在亚非其他国家以至澳大利亚，也不断地发出同样的呼声。
    可是，美国一再用种种借口，拒绝了苏联关于停止核武器试验的建议。这些所谓的“理由”本来不值一驳。现在，美国总统前裁军特别顾问史塔生，由于在裁军问题上同美国当权派发生分歧被迫辞职以后，说出了真情，更加证明了美国反对停止核武器试验，是完全没有道理的。
    我们亚非各国人民决心同世界各国人民在一起，坚决反对美国进行核武器备战的罪恶活动。我们应该采取共同行动，首先阻止美国预定从4月起在恩纳威托克岛进行核武器试验，并进而把太平洋变为真正太平的海洋！
