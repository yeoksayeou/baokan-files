    The Boiling Steel City
    Cao Ming
    Listen, what is that sound, bustling and shaking the skies above the steel city day and night? Is it a summer mountain torrent? No, spring has just returned here. Is it the boiling of molten iron in the blast furnace? No, the roar of molten iron can't compare to its magnificence. Is the open-hearth furnace tapping steel? No, the molten steel doesn't sing as joyfully. What exactly is it then? – It is the steel front's strongmen, with loyalty, wisdom, and practical action, throwing themselves into the battle against waste and conservatism, sounding an unbroken, magnificent cry.
    Ten Days of Achievements
    Some say that ten days of achievements surpass the total of the First Five-Year Plan. Leaders "igniting the fire on themselves" and "the masses bombarding the headquarters," when has this ever happened in history? On March 10th, the Black Metallurgy Design Institute took the lead, posting 40,000 big-character posters overnight. When the news reached the municipal party committee, the first secretary immediately convened a municipal party committee meeting at the design institute. The voice of the Party encouraged all the employees of the institute and the 210,000 workers and cadres of all institutions in the city. In an instant, in every workshop, every unit, every corner, the masses wrote their innermost thoughts into big-character posters. In the past ten days, the city has sold more than one million tons of paper and posted more than ten million big-character posters. Most touching of all, the municipal party committee broke with convention, holding on-the-spot meetings in the workshops; factory and mine leaders worked shifts with the workers, cultivated "experimental plots," and settled down among the masses. The masses are overjoyed, creating new records every day to welcome this transforming new high tide. On the 18th, the iron smelting plant broke yesterday's target again, increasing production by 300 tons; the No. 2 steel smelting plant overproduced 1,800 tons on the 19th. The workers of Gongchangling Mine are fiercely catching up with Dagushan and Dashiqiao; the capital construction departments are determined to complete all projects within this year, so that the production workers have a place to use their skills. Engineering and technical personnel and intellectuals have sworn an oath, determined to give their hearts to the Party, and to be both red and expert in striving to complete the Second Five-Year Plan. The attitude of those who serve the industrial and mining enterprises has also changed greatly: cooks deliver meals to the site; medical personnel organize mobile medical teams, going deep among the masses. The theater troupe, with drums and gongs, announced its determination to perform in factories, mines, and rural areas, striving for self-sufficiency and also handing over profits... Ah, what new things will emerge in the future? – No one can predict.
    The Mute Speaks
    More than ten million big-character posters are a huge number. They demonstrate the immeasurable power of the masses and the irrepressible enthusiasm for socialist construction. Everyone is speaking, and they have learned to use the weapon of criticism to help the leaders, urging everyone to run the enterprises well and do a good job. Many people who haven't offered an opinion in nine years have also spoken up. The most amazing is that an illiterate mute worker from the Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine actually spoke. In the movement, a torrent of patriotism and love for the Party冲激 him, and he couldn't hold it back any longer. He gestured and begged someone to write for him. He said that the person who carried water with him bullied him because he was mute, always ordering him to carry water, while he himself went to play and doze off. Therefore, he asked the leaders to simply reduce the lazy man's workload, and let him do the work of two people alone. He also gestured that some section chiefs use boiling water to wash clothes, which is also a great waste. ... In this way, he asked someone to write more than twenty big-character posters for him. Everyone can see that in recent days the mute worker has been truly happy, swinging his two buckets high in the air. Ah, he wants to sing, because his mind is full of stirring, beautiful poems!
    Let This One Finger Be Exposed to the Sunlight
    The "Double-Anti" exhibition halls in the Anshan Construction, Anshan Steel, and Design Institute systems alone number nearly three hundred. They are picking out watermelons from sesame seeds, systematically, analytically, and with suggestions, categorizing them into special topics for airing views. The Design Institute set up a "Rescue Table" with a heart-stopping name. That was the design workers working hard overnight, re-examining design drawings and design schemes, rescuing projects that are being designed, are under construction, or will be designed and constructed, and timely recovering large amounts of state investment. For example, the question of whether it is cheaper to smelt steel with small open-hearth furnaces or with converters has been debated in the past. Now the workers boldly overturned the design of small open-hearth furnace steelmaking and adopted the design of converter steelmaking; in this way, the investment in one plant can build three steel plants with the same output. The "Baogang Assault Team" and the "Henan Combat Team" rescued 2.9 million yuan of funds. ... The Mining Design Institute rescued more than 100 million yuan of funds in just a few days.
    The "Quality Exhibition Hall" of the large rolling mill pointed out to people that due to the low quality of products and the large number of defective products, the funds lost to the state since the start of operation are enough to build half of a large rolling mill. Isn't this a heartbreaking thing?
    Steel joint enterprises value collaboration, but there are many people who are not red or not expert, or who are expert but not red, who only know how to complete their own work and only care about the tasks of their own units; they do not understand the principle that mutual cooperation is needed for common progress. The "Passing-the-Buck Exhibition Hall" used many cartoons, quick patter, and charts to vividly expose the evils brought about by buck-passing.
    The most brilliant is the "Burning the Five Vices Hall" of the iron smelting plant, where the workers used the most pungent satire and the most sincere friendship to give their factory director a comrade-style criticism. Compilations such as "Newly Compiled Stories" and "Cai Zi's Military Tactics" described the factory director's arrogance, squeamishness, detachment from politics, and detachment from the masses in a way that made people unable to help but reject them; but the ardent expectations and love for the factory director gave him enough courage and confidence to correct his mistakes. It is obvious that the hearts of the critics and the criticized are connected - they are all single-mindedly trying to run the enterprise well, so they can easily find a common language. The masses believe that the factory director will make everyone feel satisfied with the correction of his mistakes. When the masses rise up, they will generate infinite power, and the daily increase in pig iron production in these few days is the best proof.
    In order to move forward, people are not afraid to take out the shortcomings and errors in their work, which is merely a comparison between one finger and nine fingers. So, let this one finger be exposed to the sunlight.
    Now, the 210,000 workers of Anshan are gearing up, because everything yesterday was still "conservative." In the leaping situation, everyone wants to move towards more advanced goals. May the footprints of great strides flatten the old records; may the raging fire burn out the three bad ideologies and the five vices. 1958.3.23 in Anshan.

    沸腾的钢都
    草明
    听，那是什么声音，闹腾腾地日夜震荡着钢都的上空？是夏季的山洪暴发？不是，这儿才大地回春。是高炉内的铁水沸腾？不是，铁水咆哮声还比不上它的雄亮。是平炉在出钢么？不是，钢水唱得没有它欢腾。那究竟是什么呀？——是钢铁战线上的健儿们用忠诚、智慧，用实际行动投入了双反的战斗，响起了连绵不息的雄壮的呐喊。
    十天的战果
    有人说，十天战果，胜似第一个五年计划的总和。领导“引火烧身”“群众炮打司令官”，历史上几曾有过？3月10日，黑色冶金设计院一马当先，连夜贴出大字报四万张。消息传到市委，第一书记立刻在设计院召开市委会议。党的声音鼓舞了全院职工，鼓舞了全市二十一万工人和各机关干部。瞬息间，各个车间、各个单位，各个角落，群众都将心里话写成大字报。十天来，全市共售出纸一百余万吨，贴出大字报一千多万张。最感动人的是，市委打破常规，到车间开现场会议；厂矿领导干部跟班劳动、种“试验田”、到群众中安家落户。群众心花怒放，天天创新纪录来迎接这个变革的新高潮。18日炼铁厂又突破了昨天的指标，增加三百吨；第二炼钢厂19日超产一千八百吨。弓长岭矿工猛追大孤山和大石桥；基本建设部门决心在今年内完成各项工程，让生产工人有用武之地。工程技术人员、知识分子誓师，决心把心交给党，在努力完成第二个五年计划中做到又红又专。为工矿服务的人员态度也大变，炊事员把饭送到现场；医务人员组织巡回医疗组，深入群众。剧团锣鼓喧天，宣布决心到厂、矿、农村演出，争取自给、还要上缴利润……啊，今后还会有些什么新鲜事儿出现？——谁也不能预料。
    哑吧说话了
    一千多万张大字报，是个巨大的数字。它显示了群众拥有不可估计的无穷力量，和不可抑制的社会主义建设热情。所有的人都说话了，他们学会了运用批评的武器来帮助领导，催动大家办好企业、搞好工作。许多九年没有提过意见的人也开口了。其中最奇的要数大石桥镁矿的一个不识字的哑吧工人也居然说话了。在运动里，一股爱国爱党的洪流冲激他，他再也憋不住了。他比手比脚地求人家代他写。他说和他一块儿挑水的那个人欺负他是个哑吧，尽支使他来挑水，自己却去玩耍打盹。所以他要求领导上干脆把那个懒汉减掉，两人干的活让他一个人来干。他又比划说有些科长用开水洗衣服，这也是个很大的浪费。……就这样，他一共求人代他写了二十几张大字报。谁都看得见，近天来哑吧工人真是心情舒畅，两个水桶甩得半天高。啊，他要歌唱，因为他满脑子里都是激荡人心的美丽的诗篇！
    让这一个手指头在阳光下露面吧
    光是鞍建、鞍钢、设计院系统的“双反”展览馆就有将近三百个。他们是从芝麻、西瓜中挑出西瓜来，有系统、有分析、有建议地分门别类作专题鸣放。设计院用惊心动魄的名字设个“抢救台”，那是设计工作者们连夜苦战，重新审查设计图纸、设计方案，抢救出正在设计、正在施工或将要设计和施工的工程，及时挽回国家大量投资。例如小平炉炼钢省钱呢还是转炉炼钢省钱的问题，过去曾争论过。现在职工大胆推翻小平炉炼钢的设计，采用了转炉炼钢的设计；这样，一个厂的投资可以办三个同样产量的炼钢厂。“包钢突击队”“河南战队”抢救了二百九十万元资金。……矿山设计院仅几天工夫就抢救出资金一亿多元。
    大型轧钢厂的“质量展览馆”给人们指明由于产品质量低、废品多，开工以来给国家损失的资金已够建设半座大型轧钢厂。难道这不是件叫人怪心痛的事吗？
    钢铁联合企业贵于协作，但是却有不少不红不专或者专而不红的人，只知道完成本身的工作，只顾本单位的任务；不懂得互相配合才能共同前进的道理。“扯皮展览馆”用了许多漫画、快板、图表，生动地揭露了扯皮所带来的恶果。
    最精彩的要算炼铁厂的“火烧五气馆”，这儿职工们用最辛辣的讽刺，最恳切的情谊，给自己的厂长以同志式的批评。“故事新编”“蔡子兵法”等编，把厂长的骄气、娇气、脱离政治、脱离群众的缺点描写得使人不能不厌弃它们；但是对厂长期望的殷切和热爱，却又使他有足够的勇气和信心去改正错误。这是显而易见的，批评者和被批评者的心是相通的——他们一心只想把企业办好，所以他们很容易找到共同的语言。群众相信厂长在改正错误上使大家感到满意。群众起来了，就会产生无穷的力量，这几天内生铁日产量的日日高涨，就是个最好的证明。
    为了前进，人们不怕把自己工作中的缺点和错误拿出来，这仅仅是一个手指头和九个手指头之比罢了。那么，就让这一个手指头在阳光下露面吧。
    现在，鞍山二十一万工人正在磨拳擦掌，原来昨天的一切，还是“保守”两个字。在飞跃的形势里，人人要向更先进的目标迈进。愿大踏步前进的脚印踏平了陈旧的纪录；愿烈火烧尽了三个坏主义和五气。　1958.3.23于鞍山。
