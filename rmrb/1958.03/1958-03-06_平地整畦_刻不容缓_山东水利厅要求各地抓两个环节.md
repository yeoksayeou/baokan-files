    Leveling Land and Preparing Fields Is of Utmost Importance
    Shandong Water Conservancy Department Requires All Regions to Focus on Two Key Aspects

    (Our Dispatch) How to ensure the proper completion of land leveling and field preparation work and fully realize the effectiveness of water conservancy projects during large-scale farmland water conservancy construction is what leadership organs at all levels in Shandong Province are addressing.

    In most areas of Shandong, land leveling and field preparation work has not been given due attention. For example, in the Laiyang Special District, the irrigated area has increased by 1.57 million mu since last winter, but less than 90,000 mu of land has been leveled. In the Yimeng Mountain area, land leveling and field preparation work has essentially not started yet. Even in the Liaocheng Special District in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, where land leveling and field preparation work is relatively better, only about half of the newly added 4 million mu of irrigated land has been leveled.

    Due to uneven terrain, the constructed water conservancy facilities inevitably cannot be fully utilized.

    According to an analysis by the person in charge of the Provincial Water Conservancy Department, the primary reason is that there is a certain degree of one-sidedness in the thinking of the leadership. Leadership energy is mostly focused on water conservancy construction, with less attention paid to how to better utilize the completed projects. Therefore, when assigning tasks or inspecting work, the emphasis on land leveling and field preparation work is often not strong enough, and the measures are not specific enough. The person in charge of the Water Conservancy Department believes that all regions must immediately overcome this backward situation. This person in charge said that to do a good job in land leveling and field preparation, two key aspects must be grasped: improving awareness, correcting the thinking of emphasizing construction while neglecting utilization, and strengthening leadership over this work; and agricultural cooperatives must earnestly arrange labor rationally. In addition, necessary technical guidance should be provided. All places that have done this have achieved good results. (Xinhua News Agency Special) (Attached picture)

### 平地整畦　刻不容缓  山东水利厅要求各地抓两个环节

    平地整畦　刻不容缓
    山东水利厅要求各地抓两个环节
    本报讯　在大量进行农田水利建设中，如何保证做好平地整畦工作、充分发挥水利工程效能？山东省各级领导机关正在着手解决。
    山东大部分地区的平地整畦工作都未被重视，如莱阳专区，去年冬季以来共增加灌溉面积一百五十七万亩，而经过平整的土地还不到九万亩；沂蒙山区的平地整畦工作至今基本上没有动起来；就是平地整畦工作搞的较好的黄河下游的聊城专区，在新增加的四百多万亩水浇田中，已经平整的也仅大半数。
    因为地形不平，兴建的水利设备势必不能全部发挥作用。
    据省水利厅负责人分析，首先是由于领导思想上存在着一定程度的片面性，领导精力用于水利建设方面多，对如何更好地利用已经建成的工程则抓的少。因此，在布置任务或检查工作时，对平地整畦工作往往强调得不够有力，措施不够具体。水利厅负责人认为各地必需立即克服这种落后状况。这位负责人说，做好平地整畦工作必须抓两个环节：提高认识，纠正重建设轻利用的思想，加强对这一工作的领导；各农业社切实做到合理安排劳力。另外，再辅以必要的技术指导。凡是这样作的地方，都收到了良好的效果。　（新华社专稿）（附图片）
