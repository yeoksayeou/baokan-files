Breaking Conventions for Reader Convenience
National Newspaper and Magazine Distribution Work Shows Initial Signs of a New Look

    (Our dispatch) Amidst the tide of the national Great Leap Forward, newspaper and magazine distribution work has also begun to show a new look. Some local post offices, adhering to the principle of "everything for the convenience of readers," have rapidly changed certain rules and regulations.

    Regarding subscription systems, the Beijing Postal Bureau used to close subscriptions for out-of-town newspapers for the following month on the 10th of each month. Now, this deadline has been extended to the 24th, a fourteen-day extension. Previously, readers in Baoding who subscribed to the People's Daily from the post office could only see the newspaper after a week at the earliest. Now, the Baoding Post Office has broken with past conventions, using retail newspapers to supply subscribers first, so readers can see the newspaper the next day.

    In the past, most post offices would collect newspaper fees for the following month from readers before the end of the current month. However, many readers receive their salaries at the beginning of the month, and often could not pay the newspaper fees at the end of the month. Now, the Hunan Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration has proposed coordinating collection with the salary distribution of various units, opening a door of convenience for many readers. Moreover, readers can subscribe or cancel at any time (e.g., from the 6th of this month to the 5th of next month), breaking the rigid rule that subscribing to a monthly newspaper must start from the beginning of the month and end at the end of the month. This not only facilitates readers but also changes the old "rule" of artificially declining newspaper sales at the beginning of each month.

    To further facilitate readers' subscriptions, the Yueyang Post Office, in addition to actively contacting old subscribers and collecting fees door-to-door, also organizes mobile subscription teams to go to various units to collect subscriptions. Post offices in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Tianjin have also generally implemented telephone subscriptions. To solve the newspaper fee problem for some readers, the Feixi County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau in Anhui organized readers to subscribe jointly, formed reading groups, contacted waste recycling stations to collect old newspapers, or subscribed according to the farmers' harvest season, greatly reducing the burden on readers and enabling more readers to subscribe to newspapers.

    Regarding the retail of newspapers, the Beijing Postal Bureau has proposed doubling the retail quantity of newspapers and magazines in the short term. Now, all postal branches in the city sell newspapers and magazines and also sell them on the streets. Readers can also buy newspapers and magazines by telephone. Beijing has also organized students participating in work-study programs to sell newspapers. The sound of selling newspapers can be heard everywhere on the streets, and readers living in small alleys can also buy newspapers at their doorsteps. The Feixi County Post Office, which previously did not retail newspapers, now also retails central-level and provincial- and municipal-level Party newspapers.

    Regarding the delivery of newspapers, many post offices are doing their best to save time so that readers can see newspapers as soon as possible. The Xishui County Post Office in Hubei changed the old method of rural postmen leaving early and returning late, connecting the departure time with the arrival time of newspapers, so that readers could see newspapers ten to twenty-four hours earlier than before. The rural postman in Zhouxi Township, Wenshui, Shanxi, changed his place of accommodation, enabling cadres who were sent to work in the countryside, 150 li away from Taiyuan, to see the Shanxi Daily at around 2:00 pm on the same day. Li Hutian, a rural postman in Yanji County, Jilin, took the initiative to adjust his postal route, speeding up the distribution by one day.

    (Our dispatch) After seventeen advanced distribution workers across the country put forward a proposal for a leap forward in distribution work, some post offices, with a leap-forward attitude of comparing with advanced workers and striving for progress, have put forward advanced indicators for increasing the number of newspaper and magazine distributions. Advanced distribution workers in Henan Province proposed: Guaranteeing that the province's distribution of various newspapers and magazines will exceed the target by 40% this year, with the distribution of central-level Party newspapers increasing by 70%, provincial-level Party newspapers increasing by 40%, and district-level Party newspapers increasing by 80%. The retail quantity of newspapers and magazines in the province will increase by 80%. The Pingquan County Post Office in Hebei Province proposed: Guaranteeing that the county's distribution of newspapers and magazines will double this year. The Xishui County Post Office in Hubei Province proposed: Every township should have central-level Party newspapers, every commune should have provincial newspapers, and every team should have county newspapers. Wang Huaili, a rural postman in Yongcheng County, Henan, proposed: Guaranteeing that newspapers and magazines will follow cadres to the mountains and the countryside, and that newspapers and magazines will be distributed to every small team. Within his postal route, the number of newspaper and magazine distributions will increase fivefold this year, the number of delivery points will expand from the current twenty-five to sixty-five, and the daily postal route will be extended to one hundred and fifty li.

    Currently, postal distributors in various provinces and cities across the country are holding meetings to respond to the "Six Comparisons" initiative. Some post offices will also propose more advanced indicators. A nationwide upsurge in the leap forward of distribution work has the momentum of a gathering storm.

    打破陈规一切为了便利读者
    全国报刊发行工作初露新气象
    本报讯　在全国大跃进的浪潮中，报刊发行工作也开始出现了新气象。有些地方的邮局，在一切为了便利读者的原则下，迅速地改变某些规章制度。
    在订阅制度方面，过去北京市邮局每月十号就截止收订下月份的外地报纸，现在延长到24日，比原来延长了十四天。原来保定市读者向邮局订阅人民日报，最快要一周后才能看到报纸。现在保定邮局打破了过去的陈规，改用零售报先供应订户，读者次日就可看到报了。
    过去一般邮局都是在这月底以前，向读者预收下月的报费。但是，很多读者都是月初发工资，往往月底时交不上报费。现在湖南省邮电管理局提出配合各单位发薪时收订，给许多读者开了方便之门。而且读者还可以从任何时候起订，任何时候停止
  （如从这月六号订到下月五号），打破了过去订一月报纸必须从月初起月底止的死板规定。这样，既方便读者，又改变了人为的每月初报纸销售数量下降的老“规律”。
    为了进一步便利读者订阅，岳阳邮局除了主动联系老订户并上门去收费外，还组织流动收订组到各单位去收订。北京、上海、沈阳、天津等城市邮局还普遍实行了电话订阅。安徽肥西县邮电局为了给一部分读者解决报费问题，组织读者合伙订报，组织读报组，联系废品收购站收购旧报纸，或按农民收获季节订阅，大大减轻了读者的负担，使更多的读者能订阅报纸。
    在零售报纸方面，北京邮局提出要在短期内使报刊零售数量增加一倍。现在全市所有邮局分支机构，全都零售报纸，并且上街流动叫卖。读者还可以用电话购买报刊。北京市还组织了勤工俭学的学生卖报，街头到处可闻卖报声，住在小胡同里的读者也能在门口买到报纸。肥西县邮局过去不零售报纸，现在也零售中央级和省市级党报了。
    在投送报纸方面，许多邮局都在尽量争取时间，让读者能尽快看到报纸。湖北浠水县邮局改变了过去乡邮员早出晚归的老办法，出班时间与报纸到达时间衔接起来，使读者比过去提早了十至二十四小时看到报纸。山西文水周西乡的乡邮员改变了住宿地点，使距太原一百五十里的下放干部，在下午两点钟左右就能看到当天的山西日报。吉林延吉县乡邮员李虎天主动调整邮路后，使发行速度快了一天。
    本报讯　在全国十七位先进发行工作者提出了发行工作的跃进倡议书以后，部分邮局正以比先进比干劲的跃进姿态，提出了增加报刊发行数量的先进指标。河南省先进发行工作人员提出：保证今年全省各种报刊发行数量超额完成40％，其中中央级党报发行数量增加70％，省级党报增加40％，区级党报增加80％。全省报刊零售数量增加80％。河北省平泉县邮局提出：保证今年全县报刊发行数量翻一翻。湖北浠水县邮局提出：乡乡有中央级党报，社社有省报，队队有县报。河南永城县乡邮员王怀礼提出：保证作到报刊随干部上山下乡，报刊要发到每个小队。在他的邮路内，今年报刊发行数量要翻五翻，投递点由现在的二十五个扩大到六十五个，每天邮路延长到一百五十华里。
    现在全国各省市邮局发行人员，正分别开会响应“六比”倡议书。有些邮局还将提出更先进的指标。一个全国性的发行工作跃进热潮大有山雨欲来之势。
