Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 14th: TASS, Moscow, March 14th: The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement: Recently, foreign newspapers reported that the United States and other Western countries are brewing a plan to convene the United Nations Disarmament Commission. Knowing that the work of the committee will not have any good results, they are determined to say that the main reason why disarmament negotiations are at a standstill is that the Soviet Union refused to participate in the work of the committee. Under this pretext, they intend to transfer the entire disarmament issue to the Security Council for discussion. It is pointed out that the member states of the Disarmament Commission that participate in the Western military bloc are already preparing for this.

In view of this plan of the Western countries, the Soviet Foreign Ministry believes it is necessary to make the following statement.

The Soviet government has always been eager to ease international tensions and immediately resolve the issue of disarmament, and has suggested holding a meeting of national leaders with the participation of government heads in the near future.

The issues that the Soviet Union proposed to discuss at this meeting include: immediately ceasing the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, not using such weapons, establishing areas free of atomic, hydrogen and rocket weapons in Europe, reducing foreign troops stationed in Germany and other European countries, and other issues. Solving these urgent disarmament issues would greatly improve the overall international situation and create conditions for further achievements in disarmament and solving other important international issues.

The Soviet government's initiative to convene a high-level meeting has been enthusiastically embraced and widely supported by the people of all countries. The public throughout the world and the governments of many countries have called for this meeting to be convened as soon as possible in order to end the "Cold War" and terminate the arms race and the heavy burden it has created in the short term.

Currently, the main parties concerned are actively consulting on specific issues related to organizing this meeting. Not long ago, the Soviet Union proposed that a foreign ministers' meeting be held in April this year to prepare the agenda for the summit meeting of government heads proposed by the Soviet Union to be held in June this year and to determine the members of this meeting.

Under these circumstances, the plan to convene the United Nations Disarmament Commission and transfer the disarmament issue to the Security Council can only be regarded as an attempt to divert attention from measures to convene a high-level meeting of government heads, because one of the main tasks of the high-level meeting will also be to seek ways to reach a mutually agreed decision on the issue of disarmament. It cannot be ignored that this may also be used by some people who are not interested in improving the international situation and who are trying to prevent negotiations and rationally resolve the current differences between major powers.

Anyone who can look at things objectively will inevitably come to this conclusion. In fact, the working experience of the United Nations Disarmament Commission and the Subcommittee for many years shows that they are unable to get the disarmament issue out of the current deadlock. This is because most of the members of the United Nations Disarmament Commission and the Subcommittee are participating countries of the Western military bloc. Instead of seeking mutually acceptable agreements, they resist all proposals that do not conform to the interests of these military blocs. These two institutions have become obstacles to the cause of disarmament and are increasingly becoming a guise to cover up the arms race of Western countries.

Of course, the Soviet Union cannot compromise with this situation. In order to create more favorable conditions for studying the issue of disarmament, thereby clearing the way for reaching agreements on practical measures in this regard, the Soviet Union proposed at the Twelfth Session of the United Nations General Assembly to establish a permanent Disarmament Commission composed of all member states of the United Nations. A commission constituted in this way would enable all countries (regardless of size) to directly participate in the discussion of disarmament issues and contribute to the resolution of disarmament issues.

The Western countries did not support this fair proposal, but instead forcibly passed a resolution that kept everything the same. Even in the new expanded composition of the commission, sixteen of the twenty-five member states have joined the various military blocs led by Western countries, which makes it possible for them to continue to obstruct the adoption of any resolutions aimed at: banning atomic weapons, stopping the testing of atomic weapons, removing foreign military bases on the territory of other countries, greatly reducing armed forces and armaments, establishing corresponding international supervision to supervise the fulfillment of the obligations undertaken by various countries, and so on.

The Soviet Union, which has consistently fought for disarmament, certainly cannot agree to such an old-fashioned solution. Therefore, at the Twelfth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet delegation stated that the Soviet Union would not participate in the work of this commission. Needless to say, this statement by the Soviet Union is still valid now.

Those who are now planning to convene the Disarmament Commission are very clear about the Soviet Union's attitude towards this commission and the reasons why the Soviet Union cannot participate in the work of the commission.

Knowing that convening the commission is useless, but still wanting to convene it, shows that the intention of those who are playing this trick is not to create conditions for the practical study and resolution of the urgent disarmament issue, but to try to worsen the situation, aggravate the existing differences between countries, and create new obstacles that are unfavorable to the resolution of the disarmament issue.

For this disgraceful purpose, some people are also trying to use the Security Council to submit the disarmament issue to the Security Council for discussion. It cannot be ignored that the purpose of playing this trick is to use the prestige of the Security Council to cover up the Western countries' already bankrupt policy on disarmament. All these practices are happening precisely when world public opinion is particularly strongly demanding that measures be taken to ease international tensions and to hold high-level talks for this purpose.

It is necessary to find new ways to get the disarmament issue out of the deadlock caused by the position of Western countries. For this purpose, it is best to convene a meeting with the participation of government heads as soon as possible to resolve the most urgent international issues on which unanimous decisions can be reached, especially the disarmament issue. This approach will produce the best results and there will be a real possibility of implementing some measures to lay the foundation for easing the tensions in relations between countries, which the people of all countries eagerly desire.

### 苏联外交部发表声明  谴责西方玩弄阻挠裁军的花招  指出应尽早开首脑会议来解决裁军问题

    苏联外交部发表声明
    谴责西方玩弄阻挠裁军的花招
    指出应尽早开首脑会议来解决裁军问题
    新华社1 4日讯　塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：苏联外交部声明：最近外国报纸报道说，美国和其他西方国家正在酝酿召开联合国裁军委员会的计划。它们明知委员会的工作不会有任何良好效果，于是决意把事情说成这样，似乎裁军谈判陷于僵局的主要原因是苏联拒绝了参加委员会的工作。在这种借口下，它们打算把整个裁军问题转交给安全理事会讨论。据指出，裁军委员会中那些参加西方军事集团的成员国在这方面已在进行准备工作。
    鉴于西方国家的这项计划，苏联外交部认为有必要作如下声明。
    苏联政府向来热切地主张缓和国际紧张局势和立刻解决裁军问题，曾经建议在最近举行有政府首脑参加的国家领导人会议。
    苏联建议在这次会议上讨论的问题包括：立刻停止试验原子武器和氢武器、不使用这类武器、在欧洲建立无原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器的地区、裁减在德国和其他欧洲国家境内的外国军队及其他问题。解决这些迫切的裁军问题，就会使整个国际局势大大好转，并为在裁军方面取得进一步的成绩以及解决其他重要的国际问题创造条件。
    苏联政府关于召开高级会议的倡议得到各国人民的热烈拥护和普遍支持。全世界的公众、许多国家的政府都要求尽速召开这个会议，以便在短期内结束“冷战”、终止军备竞赛和它所造成的沉重负担。
    现在，主要的有关方面正在就有关组织这个会议的具体问题积极进行磋商。不久前苏联提出了建议，主张在今年4月举行外长会议来准备苏联建议在今年6月举行的政府首脑会议的议程和确定这个会议的成员。
    在这种情况下，召开联合国裁军委员会并把裁军问题转交安全理事会的计划只能被认为是企图转移大家对召开政府首脑高级会议的措施的注意，因为高级会议的主要任务之一也将是寻求途径，设法就裁军问题达成大家一致同意的决定。不能不看到，这一点也可能被某些人所利用，这些人对于使国际局势好转不感兴趣，他们图谋不让举行谈判，合理地解决大国之间目前的分歧。
    凡是能够用客观态度看待事情的人，都必然会得出这样的结论。事实上，联合国裁军委员会和小组委员会多年来的工作经验说明，它们没有能力使裁军问题摆脱目前所处的僵局。这是因为，联合国裁军委员会和小组委员会的成员大多数是西方军事集团的参加国，他们不是寻求互相可以接受的协议，而是抵制一切不符合这些军事集团利益的建议。这两个机构变成了裁军事业的障碍，日益成为掩饰西方国家进行军备竞赛的幌子。
    当然，苏联不能同这种情况妥协。为了建立更有利的条件来研究裁军问题，从而扫清道路以便就在这方面采取实际措施达成协议，苏联在联合国大会第十二届会议上建议成立一个由联合国全体成员国组成的常设裁军委员会。这样组成的委员会就可以使所有国家（不分大小）都能直接参加讨论裁军问题，并且对解决裁军问题作出贡献。
    西方国家没有支持这个公正的建议，反而强行通过了使一切照旧的决议。就是在委员会新的扩大组成中，二十五个成员国里也有十六个加入了西方国家所领导的各种军事集团，这就使得它们今后仍有可能阻挠通过达到下列目的的任何决议：禁止原子武器、停止试验原子武器、撤除外国在别国领土上的军事基地、大大削减武装部队和军备、建立相应的国际监督来监督各国履行自己所承担的义务等等。
    苏联一贯为争取裁军而斗争，当然不能同意那种老一套的解决办法。因此，在联合国大会第十二届会议上苏联代表团声明，苏联将不参加这个委员会的工作。不言而喻，苏联这项声明现在仍然有效。
    现在正在策划召开裁军委员会的人，都非常清楚苏联对这个委员会的态度以及苏联所不能参加委员会工作的原因。
    明知召开委员会毫无用处，而又要召开，这说明玩弄这种花招的人本意不是想为切实研究和解决刻不容缓的裁军问题创造条件，而是力图使局势恶化，加剧各国间现有的分歧，制造不利于解决裁军问题的新障碍。
    为了这一不光彩的目的，有人还企图利用安全理事会，把裁军问题提交安全理事会讨论。不能不看到，玩弄这种花招的目的，是想借安全理事会的威信来掩盖西方国家在裁军问题上的已经破产了的政策。所有这一切做法都恰恰发生在世界舆论特别坚决要求采取措施缓和国际紧张局势和为此目的举行高级会谈的时候。
    必需找寻新的途径，使裁军问题摆脱由于西方国家的立场而陷入的僵局。为此最好尽速召开有政府首脑参加的会议，来解决有可能取得一致决定的最迫切的国际问题，首先是裁军问题。这一途径才会产生最好的结果，才能有现实的可能来贯彻一些措施，以便为各国人民所热望的缓和各国关系中的紧张局势奠定基础。
