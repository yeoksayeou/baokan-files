    Walk Less, Work More
    Move Home to the Mountains During the Busy Farming Season
    (Our Dispatch) The Yinhe Township Agricultural Cooperative in Hua'an County, Fujian Province, is implementing the method of "moving homes to the mountains during the busy farming season" to change the backward state of extensive cultivation in mountainous areas.
    In Yinhe Township, over 80% of the more than 1,000 mu of land is distributed in the mountains, with the fields closest to the village being about seven or eight li away, and the fields farthest from the village being more than ten li away. In the past, farmers spent a lot of effort climbing and walking to work in the mountains, and many farmers wavered in their confidence in building the mountainous areas. Labor efficiency was very low, cultivation was very rough, and yields declined year by year.
    During this year's spring plowing, all members of the cooperative, through a major debate, refuted the idea held by some members that mountainous areas had "four hardships" (hard labor, hard walking, hard living, and hard to get married) and summarized the experience of old farmers Li Qingbo, Li Jinbi, and others who had moved homes to the mountains during busy farming seasons in the past, practicing intensive cultivation and producing more grain. For example, before collectivization, Li Jinbi's per-mu yield of self-cultivated land was above 800 jin, and the main experience was to move the home to the mountains during the busy farming season, working from dawn till dusk. Others applied a few dan of fertilizer per mu, while he applied more than a dozen dan per mu; others plowed and harrowed the fields once, while he plowed and harrowed the fields two or three times. Through the education of these facts, the members found a way, and everyone believed that the mountainous areas were originally "full of treasures and full of gold," and as long as they worked hard, they would not live a poor life. During the spring plowing, 130 male and female laborers in the township built eight large thatched sheds on the mountains, moved to live in the mountains, slept in the mountains, ate in the mountains, and worked in the mountains. According to the estimates of the old farmers, moving to the mountains to work would allow 130 laborers to be used as 180 laborers in the past. For example, in the past, fertilizer accumulation was all in and around the village, and it was only carried to the mountains when needed. This year, more than 60 grass huts were built on the mountains to achieve on-site accumulation and on-site application. By the beginning of March, the accumulated fertilizer averaged 20 dan per mu, an increase of nearly four times compared with the total fertilizer consumption last year. After moving to the mountains, all the laborers achieved "going to work when the rooster crows, and returning from work with lanterns," greatly improving labor efficiency. At this time last year, plowing had not yet begun, but this year it has generally been plowed once, and the second plowing has already been completed for more than one-third of the land. This year, the average yield per mu for the entire cooperative is required to reach 750 jin.

### 少走路　多干活  农忙搬家上山

    少走路　多干活
    农忙搬家上山
    本报讯　福建省华安县银和乡农业社实行“农忙迁家上山”的办法，改变山区耕作粗放的生产落后状态。
    银和乡全乡一千多亩土地，有80％左右分布在山上，距村近的山田约七、八华里，距村远的山田在十华里以上。过去，农民上山劳动，把许多工夫花在爬山、走路上，不少农民动摇了建设山区的信心，劳动效率很低，耕作非常粗糙，产量也是逐年下降。
    今年春耕中，这个社的全体社员通过大辩论驳倒了一部分社员认为山区有“四苦”（劳动苦、走路苦、生活苦、结不了婚苦）的思想，并总结了老农民李清波、李金壁等过去农忙搬家上山，精耕细作，多产粮食的经验。像李金壁，在合作化以前，自耕土地每亩产量都在八百斤以上，主要经验就是在农忙时把家迁到山上，起早搭黑干。别人的田每亩施肥几担，他的田每亩施肥十几担；别人的田犁耙一遍，他的田犁耙两遍到三遍。通过这些事实的教育，社员们找到了办法，大家认为山区本来“满山是宝，满山是金”，只要苦干，就不会过穷日子。在春耕中，全乡一百三十个男女劳力在山上搭起八个大茅棚，分别搬到山上居住，在山上睡，在山上吃，在山上劳动。据老农们估计，搬上山去劳动，一百三十个劳力可以顶过去一百八十个劳力使用。如过去积肥都在村里村外，用时才往山上挑，今年在山上搭了六十多个草寮，做到就地积，就地施，到3月初，已积存的肥料每亩平均二十担，比去年全年用肥量增加近四倍。搬上山以后，全部劳力做到“出工鸡拍胸（鸡叫），收工手提灯”，劳动效率大大地提高了。去年这时，犁田还没有开始，今年普遍犁过一遍，第二遍业已犁过三分之一以上。今年全社每亩田平均产量要求达到七百五十斤。
