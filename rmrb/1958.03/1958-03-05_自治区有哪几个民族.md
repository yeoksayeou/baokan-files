    Which Nationalities are in the Autonomous Region?
    Guangxi is a multi-ethnic region. In addition to the Zhuang and Han nationalities, there are also the Yao, Miao, Dong, Mulam, Maonan, Hui, Lolo, Shui, and Gelao nationalities, totaling eleven minority nationalities. Their population accounts for 4.7% of the total population of the region, and their concentrated residential areas account for about 10% of the region's area.
    Yao Nationality: The population is about 468,000, distributed in the three Yao autonomous counties of Dayao Mountain, Du'an, and Bama, and more than 1,600 townships in more than sixty counties, including the two autonomous counties of Longlin and Longsheng. The Yao nationality has its own language and a glorious revolutionary history. In 1927, the Yao people of Bama joined the Red Seventh Army and established the Soviet regime in Xishan. In 1933, the Yao people in six counties in northern Guangxi launched an uprising, and later, together with the Zhuang and Han people, reorganized their armed forces and assisted the People's Liberation Army in liberating Guangxi.
    The Yao people are good at singing and dancing. The beautiful bronze drum dance and Lusheng long drum dance are popular in the Yao areas of northwestern Guangxi.
    Miao Nationality: There are more than 200,300 people, mainly living in the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous County.

Miao women are generally good at embroidery, and their clothes are decorated with beautiful embroidered lace.

The Dong nationality is a diligent and brave nationality.

On the rocky mountains near their residences, even a small piece of land the size of a palm must be planted with one or two corn plants. "Soil can produce gold, and every inch of land must be cultivated!" "Diligence leads to a full stomach even if you're not rich, laziness leads to starvation even if you don't die." - These are proverbs and maxims popular among the Maonan people.
    Hui Nationality: There are about 10,000 people, distributed in Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, Yongfu, Luzhai, Baise, Pingle and other places, with more than 4,000 people living in Guilin.

After liberation, the Lolo people, like other ethnic groups, embarked on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, changed their impoverished life of rarely eating oil and salt in the past, and also established ethnic schools.
    The other ethnic groups in Guangxi are also living an increasingly prosperous and happy life after liberation. (Attached picture)

    自治区有哪几个民族
    广西是个多民族的地区，除僮族和汉族外，还有瑶、苗、侗、仫佬、毛难、回、倮倮、水家、仡佬等十一个少数民族，人数占全区人口总数的4.7％，聚居地区约占全区面积的10％。
    瑶族　人口约四十六万八千多人，分布在大瑶山、都安、巴马三个瑶族自治县和隆林、龙胜两个各族自治县等六十多个县的一千六百个乡中。瑶族有自己的语言，有光荣的革命历史。1927年，巴马的瑶族人民就参加了红七军，在西山建立了苏维埃政权。1933年，广西北部六个县的瑶族人民曾发动起义，以后又与僮、汉人民一起重新组织武装，协助解放军解放了广西。
    瑶族人民能歌善舞，优美的铜鼓舞和芦笙长鼓舞，流行在桂西北一带瑶族地区。
    苗族　有二十万零三千多人，主要聚居在大苗山苗族自治县。苗族人民在国家的领导和帮助下，创造了本民族的文字。苗族有许多特有的便利苗族男女青年选择伴侣的风俗习惯。苗族妇女们一般都善于刺绣，她们的衣服上都镶着美丽的刺绣花边。
    侗族　共有十四万九千多人，主要聚居在三江侗族自治县和龙胜各族自治县。侗族是个勤劳勇敢的民族，1925年他们击败了在三江大肆烧杀的李、白匪帮的“省防军”。解放后又配合解放军，肃清了土匪。侗族人民有自己的戏剧——侗戏。侗戏“秦娘梅”曾在全国群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩演出中获得演出优秀奖。
    仫佬族　共有四万三千多人，分布在罗城、宜山、柳城、南宁等十九个县市，主要聚居在罗城。妇女们非常勤劳，农业社妇女劳动力一般比男子还多。仫佬族人民很喜爱唱歌，歌的形式都是对唱的。
    毛难族　人口有一万八千多人，聚居在环江县水源、下南两个区。他们是一个非常勤俭节约的民族。在他们居住地附近的石山上，只要有巴掌大的一块土地也要种上一两颗玉米。“土能生黄金，寸土也要耕！”“勤不富也饱，懒不死也饿。”——这是流行在毛难族人民中的谚语和格言。
    回族　共约一万人，分布在桂林、柳州、南宁、永福、鹿寨、百色、平乐等地，聚居在桂林的有四千多人。
    倮倮族　人口约四千多，主要居住在滇桂边境的六韶山脉一带。解放后，倮倮族和其他各族人民一样走上了互助合作道路，改变了过去很少吃油盐的贫困生活，还成立了民族学校。
    广西境内的其他民族，解放后也都过着日益繁荣幸福的生活。（附图片）
