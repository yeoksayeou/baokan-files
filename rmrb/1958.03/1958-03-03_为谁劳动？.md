    For Whom Do We Labor?
    Wu Lü
    “For whom do we labor?” The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory launched a discussion around this question in the anti-waste, anti-conservatism campaign. This is indeed a fundamental question worthy of deep thought by everyone. Organizing a discussion around this question is not only absolutely necessary to thoroughly eliminate waste and conservatism, but also a extremely important topic for ideological construction among the working class and all the people in the current surging revolutionary situation.
    Now is no longer the era of laboring for the capitalists' savings. For whom do we labor? The vast majority of workers are laboring diligently with full enthusiasm and loyalty for socialism and the happiness of 600 million people. However, some workers have other ideas, or verbally say "laboring for socialism," but in reality hold other thoughts. For example, some are laboring for the "big four": bicycles, wool fabric, radios, and swimming watches; some are "half for the country, half for themselves"; and some "have never thought about the question of for whom they labor." These various ideas show that a considerable portion of workers still lack the consciousness of the working class.
    Isn't this a very strange thing? So many years after liberation, a considerable number of workers have not yet resolved the question of for whom they labor! Actually, it's not strange. Some young people who grew up in a peaceful environment see that living standards have improved, and think about improving their lives, but they are not entirely clear about where the improvement in living standards comes from; some new workers who are not from the working class observe problems with their original class colors; and a few old workers and old cadres, who once struggled in difficult environments for the victory of the socialist cause, have seen their revolutionary will gradually decline in a peaceful environment. These people have either never considered the question of for whom they labor; or have considered it, but have not resolved it correctly; or have once correctly resolved it, but today it has become a problem to be resolved. What's so strange about that? What is strange is that some Party organizations are not aware of these situations, have not discovered that the question of for whom we labor remains to be resolved, and therefore have not come up with ways to help each employee resolve the question of for whom we labor. On the contrary, for a period of time, excessive material rewards were prevalent, fueling the unhealthy trend of pursuing the "big three" and "big four" among some workers.
    The question of for whom we labor is a question of worldview, a question of work attitude. A person who thinks only of himself all day long cannot make much contribution to the collective cause, and may even cause losses to production and work. The discussion at the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory shows that many wastes and many facts of not cherishing state property in enterprises are caused by not correctly resolving the question of for whom we labor. Our socialist construction relies on the conscious efforts of the vast number of employees. Therefore, we must help all employees correctly resolve the question of for whom we labor, improve communist consciousness, and overcome individualism. Only in this way can revolutionary enthusiasm be sustained.
    The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory raised the question of for whom we labor, and raised it very well. Some other enterprises in other places are also discussing this issue. This is not a chance coincidence, but an inevitable result of the development of the anti-waste campaign. If we trace the causes of waste from the leadership's perspective, we will find bureaucracy, subjectivism, etc.; if we examine it from the masses' perspective, it touches on the question of for whom we labor. I hope that all enterprises will pay attention to the development of the anti-waste campaign and organize such a profound discussion.

    为谁劳动？
    吴滤
    “为谁劳动？”北京电子管厂在反浪费、反保守运动中围绕这样一个问题展开了讨论。这确实是一个值得人人深思的根本性的问题，围绕这个问题组织一场讨论，不只对彻底地反掉浪费、反掉保守是完全必要的，而且是在当前澎湃的革命形势下，在工人阶级和全体人民中进行思想建设的一个极其重要的课题。
    现在已经不是为资本家的存折劳动的时代了。为谁劳动呢？绝大部分工人都是满腔热情、忠心耿耿地为社会主义、为六亿人民的幸福辛勤劳动。然而，也有一些工人抱有另外的想法，或者口头上说“为社会主义劳动”，实际上抱有另外的想法。例如有人是为自行车、呢料子、收音机、游泳表等“四大件”劳动；有人是“半为国家、半为自己”；还有的“从来没有想过为谁劳动的问题”。这些形形色色的想法，表明还有相当一部分工人缺乏工人阶级的自觉。
    这是不是一件很奇怪的事情呢？解放这么多年了，竟还有相当一部分工人没有解决为谁劳动的问题！其实，也不奇怪。一些在和平环境中成长起来的青年人看到的是生活改善了，想到的是要改善生活，至于生活的改善是从哪里来的，并不完全清楚；一些非工人阶级出身的新工人，更是带着原来的阶级色彩观察问题；还有少数老工人、老干部，为了社会主义事业的胜利，曾经在艰苦的环境中斗争了过来，但到了和平环境，革命意志逐渐衰退了。这些人对于为谁劳动的问题，或者从来没有考虑；或者考虑过了，但没有正确的解决；或则曾经正确解决了，而今天又成为尚待解决的问题。这有什么奇怪的呢？值得奇怪的倒是，有些党组织并不知道这些情况，并没有发现为谁劳动的问题尚待解决，因而没有拿出办法来帮助每一个职工解决为谁劳动的问题。相反地，有一段时期倒是盛行过多的物质奖励，助长了部分工人中追求“三大件”“四大件”的歪风。
    为谁劳动的问题，是一个人生观的问题，是一个劳动态度的问题。一个整天只想到自己的人，不可能对集体事业作出多大的贡献，有时甚至会使生产和工作受到损失。北京电子管厂的讨论表明，企业中的许多浪费，许多不爱护国家财产的事实，都是由于没有正确解决为谁劳动这个问题而造成的。我们的社会主义建设，依靠广大职工自觉的努力。因此，就要帮助全体职工正确解决为谁劳动的问题，提高共产主义觉悟，克服个人主义思想。只有这样，革命干劲才能持久地发扬下去。
    北京电子管厂提出为谁劳动的问题，提得很好。别的地方也有一些企业在讨论这个问题。这不是偶然的巧合，而是反浪费运动发展的必然结果。浪费，从领导方面追原因，会追出官僚主义、主观主义等等；从群众方面检查，就触及到为谁劳动的问题。希望各个企业都来注意反浪费运动的发展，组织这样一场深刻的讨论。
