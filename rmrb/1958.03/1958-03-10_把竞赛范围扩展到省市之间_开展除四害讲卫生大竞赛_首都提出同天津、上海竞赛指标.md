(Editor's Note: The current development of the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene has presented us with a new requirement: how to expand the competition, which was previously limited to individual provinces (and cities), to inter-provincial (and city) competition, in order to further boost enthusiasm and set off a new upsurge in the movement to eliminate the four pests. At this time, Beijing's proposal of competition targets with Shanghai and Tianjin is timely and meaningful. It will not only promote the development of the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene in these three cities, but will also promote other provinces and cities to catch up and join the ranks of friendly competition.)

Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: The people of the capital are boosting their energy, striving to realize the proposal to conduct a friendly competition with Shanghai and Tianjin in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene.

In recent days, urban and suburban districts have launched large-scale activities to dig out and smash pupae, and the toilet improvement projects in most districts have also begun. Chongwen District and Xuanwu District have organized special pupae-digging teams and voluntary labor to dig and smash fly pupae. Students from many universities in Haidian District actively participated in the activities of digging and smashing fly pupae. The people of the whole city are determined to work together to achieve the following competition targets:

I. Basically eliminate house rats and sewer rats by 1958. Achieve the following targets:
    1. Spot check 100,000 households in urban and suburban areas. The number of households with no rat holes (no missed inspections and newly dug rat holes), no rat traces (no rat droppings and claw marks), and no rat damage (no nighttime disturbances and damage to clothing and furniture) should reach more than 95%;
    2. The rat density should not exceed 2%, that is, using one hundred rat traps, placed in fixed locations for three consecutive days, the total number of rats caught should not exceed two per day on average.

II. Basically eliminate sparrows by 1958, completely block all sparrow nests, and ensure that sparrows are rarely seen in and around residential areas.

III. Eliminate flies and mosquitoes, achieving the following targets:
    1. During the peak season for fly and mosquito activity in August, spot check 100,000 households in urban and suburban areas. 95% or more of households should maintain fly- and mosquito-free indoors and outdoors, and mosquito larvae-free in courtyards;
    2. Before the end of June 1958, basically deal with accumulated water pits, toilets, manure pits, key hygiene industries, and other places, to eliminate fly and mosquito breeding conditions.

IV. Urban and suburban areas should regularly maintain "three cleans" (clean streets, clean courtyards, and clean indoors). Spot check 100,000 households, and 90% of households should regularly maintain "three cleans."

V. Eliminate and control the diseases that most seriously endanger the health of the people in this city, achieving the following targets: In 1958, the incidence of dysentery should be reduced by 50% (based on 1957); the mortality rate of measles should be reduced from 1% in 1957 to 0.2%.

    把竞赛范围扩展到省市之间
    开展除四害讲卫生大竞赛
    首都提出同天津、上海竞赛指标
    编者按：当前除四害、讲卫生运动的发展向我们提出了一个新的要求，这就是如何把过去局限于各省（市）范围内的竞赛，扩展到省（市）之间的竞赛，以便更加鼓足干劲，掀起除四害运动的新高潮。北京市在这时向上海、天津两市提出竞赛的指标，是适时而富有意义的。它不仅会促进这三个城市除四害、讲卫生运动的发展，而且也将促进其它省市赶上来，参加友谊竞赛的行列。
    新华社9日讯　首都人民正鼓足干劲，努力实现同上海和天津两市开展除四害、讲卫生友谊竞赛的倡议。
    连日来，城郊各区展开了大规模的挖蛹、砸蛹活动，大部分区的改善厕所的工程也已经开始。崇文区和宣武区分别组织了突击挖蛹队和挖、砸蝇蛹的义务劳动。海淀区许多高等院校的学生积极参加了挖、砸蝇蛹活动。全市人民决心同心合力实现下面的竞赛指标：
    一、在1958年内，基本上消灭家鼠和沟鼠。达到如下指标：
    1、城郊区抽查十万户，无鼠洞（无漏查及新盗开的鼠洞）、无鼠迹（无鼠粪和爪印）、无鼠害（无夜间骚扰和损坏衣物家具）的户数达到95％以上；
    2、老鼠密度不超过2％，即用一百把鼠夹，在固定地点连放三天，扑鼠总数平均每天不超过二只。
    二、在1958年内，基本上消灭麻雀，全部堵绝雀窝，在居住区及附近经常看不到麻雀。
    三、消灭苍蝇、蚊子，达到如下指标：
    1、在蝇、蚊活动最盛的8月，城郊区抽查十万户，95％以上的户保持室内外无蝇、蚊、院内无孑孓；
    2、在1958年6月底以前，基本处理完积水坑洼、厕所、粪池、卫生重点行业等处所，消灭蝇、蚊滋生条件。
    四、城郊区经常保持三洁（街道洁、院内洁、室内洁），抽查十万户，90％的户经常保持三洁。
    五、消灭和控制危害本市人民健康最严重的疾病，达到如下指标：在1958年内，痢疾发病率下降50％（以1957年为基数）；麻疹病死率由1957年的1％下降到0.2％。
