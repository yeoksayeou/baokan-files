Everyone Makes High-Grade Ink

	The Jinzhou Nanshan XinSheng Stationery Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Liaoning Province, wrote a letter to the Beijing Ink Factory in early March, stating: "We are willing to cooperate with you technically, exchange experiences, and determine the formula for high-grade ink. We wonder what your opinion is?" Upon receiving this letter, the Beijing Ink Factory replied on the same day, welcoming comrades from Jinzhou to come to Beijing to exchange experiences.

	Two or three days later, three comrades from Jinzhou arrived at the Beijing Ink Factory. Comrades from the two factories exchanged experiences on formulas and operations. The Beijing Ink Factory also introduced its next research plans and presented the comrades from Jinzhou with samples of high-grade ink and important raw materials. The comrades from Jinzhou also taught the Beijing factory their experience in producing water-resistant red ink. Both sides felt greatly enlightened and unanimously agreed to sign a comprehensive technical cooperation contract to exchange all technical data, breaking the previous rule in some ink factories of not exchanging information on new product trials and research.

    大家都做高级墨水
    辽宁省地方国营锦州南山新生文具厂在3月初给北京市墨水厂写了封信，信中说：“我们愿意和您们在技术上合作，互相交流经验，确定高级墨水的处方，不知道您们的意见怎样？”北京市墨水厂接到这封信后，当天就回了信，欢迎锦州的同志来北京交流经验。
    过了两三天，锦州的三个同志来到了北京墨水厂。两个厂的同志在一起交流了配方和操作的经验，北京墨水厂还介绍了自己下一步准备怎样研究，给锦州的同志赠送了高级墨水和重要原料的样品。锦州的同志也把他们生产具有耐水性能的红墨水的经验教给了北京厂。双方都感到有很大启发，一致同意签订一个全面的技术合作合同，交流一切技术资料，打破了以往某些墨水厂试制研究新产品互不交流的陈规。
