    Two Themes of the Great Leap Forward
    Gan Feng
    “Seven days in the mountains, a thousand years in the world”
    “Seven days in the mountains, a thousand years in the world”—these two old sayings can be used to describe the overall situation in our country today. We people who work in the government, although we read the newspapers every day and seize every opportunity to go down to the grassroots, still struggle to keep our thinking up with the situation of this Great Leap Forward. Targets are constantly being broken, figures are constantly changing, new records are constantly appearing... The revolutionary fervor of hundreds of millions of people is like a huge whirlwind. Every day when I open the newspaper, I feel that there is too much old stuff in my head, and I have to pour some of this old stuff out in order to fill it with some new stuff.
    Yesterday, I had the opportunity to take a trip to a university. Although it hadn't been long since my previous visit, it felt like a lifetime ago. The enthusiasm of the school for engaging in work-study programs is truly burning like a raging fire. Things that seemed very fresh just a few days ago have now been left far behind by the new situation. "Seven days in the mountains, a thousand years in the world"—this metaphor is not at all false.
    However, the important issue is that we cannot stop at simply sighing and feeling emotional. How can we ensure that our thinking and work can keep up and not fall behind? This is a serious task that lies before us. I think that in addition to summoning up revolutionary fervor, getting rid of bureaucratic airs and stagnation, and breaking down conservative and backward conventions, there is another very important point: we must go down to the grassroots frequently and continuously. In ancient times, those who cultivated immortality and sought enlightenment could hide in the deep mountains, not eating the food of the human world. We are revolutionary workers, and we cannot leave the "food of the human world" for even a day. Today, there are probably almost no people who want to go to Mount Emei and Mount Wutai to cultivate immortality and seek enlightenment. However, in government offices and academic organizations, there are still quite a few people who are detached from the current mass struggle, shut themselves behind closed doors, with one room and two books, cultivating their personal brand of "immortality" and seeking their personal brand of "enlightenment." In addition, there are also some leaders who are indifferent to the masses' earth-shattering enthusiasm, clinging to the old calendar without letting go. For these two types of people, the most important thing at present is to force them to "descend the mountain," force them to "return to the secular world," and throw themselves into the fiery struggle of the Great Leap Forward!
          Stop Walking with Toes Pointing Outward
    Under the new situation of the overall Great Leap Forward, comrades who work in government offices must also make a great leap forward in their thinking and work, otherwise they will hold back the Great Leap Forward in production. To use a scientific term: it will cause certain links in the superstructure to become detached from the economic base and not adapt to it.
    It is relatively easy for comrades who work in government offices to talk about the Great Leap Forward. Because there are many intellectuals among them, they can read newspapers, they can read books, and they are very good at "understanding principles," but doing it is not an easy thing. Without determination and without summoning up revolutionary fervor, "leaping forward" is only something that is said, and can only cause a thin ripple on the surface of the work. They often only go around and around actual problems, practicing "Tai Chi," and are afraid to touch the sharp actual problems like they are afraid of fire. To tell the truth, these comrades do not intend to seriously solve the actual complex problems, but are only fighting all day long to ensure that they "don't make mistakes."
    "Making mistakes" is certainly not good, but if you stop altogether because you are afraid of making mistakes, or if you tie your hands and feet, then of course you will not make mistakes, but the revolution will be finished. To avoid making mistakes in your work, you must first not be afraid of making mistakes. Shrinking back because you are afraid of making mistakes will inevitably lead to big mistakes. In doing revolution, there will inevitably be things that are done correctly, and there will also be a few things that are done incorrectly because they do not conform to the actual situation. "Right" and "wrong" are our two teachers, teaching us from two different perspectives.
    Therefore, to make a great leap forward in work, we must first dare to make a great leap forward in thinking. In the Great Leap Forward, it is possible to scrape a little "skin" off your "legs" and have a small problem. What is so great about that? I advise these comrades to stop cherishing their "skin" and slowly walking with their "toes pointing outward!"

    跃进二题
    敢峰
    “山中方七日，世上已千年”
    “山中方七日，世上已千年”，这两句古话，可以用来形容我们国家今天整个的形势。我们这些在机关工作的人，虽然天天看报，一有机会就抓紧下去，但仍苦于思想老赶不上这个大跃进的形势。指标不断的突破，数字不断的改变，新的纪录不断的出现，……几亿人民的革命干劲像一股巨大的旋风。每天一翻开报纸，总使人感到头脑中的旧东西塞得太多，要把这些旧东西倒些出去，好装进些新东西。
    昨天，我有机会到一个大学里走了一趟，虽然比前次去并没隔多久，但是却已恍如隔世。学校搞勤工俭学的劲头，真是热火朝天。前几天还使人感到十分新鲜的事物，今天却又被新形势甩得老远。“山中方七日，世上已千年”，这个境界比喻得一点也不假。
    但是，重要的问题还在于不能止于感慨感慨而已。如何能够使自己的思想和工作能跟上去而不落后，这就是摆在我们面前的一个严重任务。我想除了鼓起革命干劲，打掉官风暮气，打破保守的、落后的常规以外，还有一条很重要的，就是要经常下去，不断的下去。古时，修仙求道可以隐身在深山中，不食人间烟火；我们是革命工作者，一日也离开“人间烟火”不得。今天，要上峨嵋山和五台山去修仙求道的人，大约是绝无仅有了；但是在机关和学术团体中，脱离当前群众斗争，关起门来，一间房，两本书，修个人主义之“仙”和求个人主义之“道”的人，却还是不少的。另外也有一些领导者，对群众的移山倒海的干劲，居然无动于衷，死抱住老皇历不放。对这两种人，目前最重要的是要逼他们“下山”，逼他们“还俗”，投身到大跃进的火热斗争中去！
          别再迈八字步
    在整个大跃进的新形势下，做机关工作的同志，在思想上、工作上也必须来个大跃进，否则就会拖住生产大跃进的后腿。用句科学上的术语说：就会使上层建筑中的某些环节和经济基础脱节，不相适应。
    做机关工作的同志，口头上谈大跃进是比较容易的。因为在他们当中知识分子很多，会看报，会看书，很能“明理”，但做起来却也不是一件容易的事。没有决心，不鼓起革命干劲，“跃进”只是挂在口头上，只能在工作的表面泛起一层薄薄的涟漪。他们常是只在实际问题周围绕来绕去，打“太极拳”，对尖锐的实际问题像怕火一样，就是不肯挨一挨。说句老实话，这些同志并没有打算认真的去解决实际的复杂问题，只是终日在为自己“不出错”而斗争。
    “出错”当然不妙，但如果因为怕出错就干脆停下来，或者捆住手脚，这样当然不会出错，而革命也就完蛋了。要工作不出错就首先不要怕出错。因怕出错而缩手，结果将必然会出大错。干革命，必然有干对的，也有少数不符合实际情况干错了的。“对”和“错”是我们的两个老师，从两个方面来教导我们。
    因此，要在工作上大跃进，首先就要在思想上敢于大跃进。在大跃进中，可能“腿”上擦破一点“皮”，出点小毛病，这又有什么了不起？奉劝这些同志，别再爱护“皮肤”而慢腾腾地迈着“八字步”了！
