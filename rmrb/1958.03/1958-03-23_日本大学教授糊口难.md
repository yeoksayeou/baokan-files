    Japanese University Professors Struggle to Make a Living
    In Japan, the income of an average university professor is less than that of a bar hostess. Many professors have to seek various jobs in their spare time to supplement their living expenses. Their main sideline is writing for newspapers and magazines or editing textbooks for bookstores, but there are too many competitors in this field, and it is not easy to find work. Some medical university professors mostly work part-time for pharmaceutical companies. Recently, there have even been professors participating in program performances on Tokyo television stations. Many professors are so busy running around for a living that they have little energy to carry out their own professional research.
    Although the lives of Japanese university professors are very hard, the Japanese government still levies 15% income tax on them. (Attached picture)

    日本大学教授糊口难
    在日本，一个普通的大学教授的收入还比不上酒吧间的女侍。许多教授不得不在课余寻觅各种工作，增加一点收入来补助生活费用。他们的主要副业是替报刊写稿或替书店编辑教科书，但是这一行的竞争者太多，工作不易找到。一些医科大学教授多半在医药公司兼职。最近，居然还有教授在东京电视广播台参加节目表演。许多教授因忙于生活奔波，很少有精力进行本身业务研究。
    日本大学教授的生活虽然很清苦，但是日本政府还要向他们征收15％的所得税。（附图片）
