Xinhua News Agency, Huangyan, 2nd. Agricultural Minister Liao Luyan said in his speech at the Southern Double-Wheel Double-Share Plow Modification Appraisal and Promotion Experience Exchange Conference on the 28th that the purpose of this on-site conference was to restore the reputation of the double-wheel double-share plow, exchange experiences, and actively promote it. This goal has been achieved. This conference will surely further promote the work of double-share plows, not only for the southern provinces, but also for the northern provinces.

	Promoting Double-Share Plows is the Beginning of Technological Reform

Liao Luyan then discussed the following three issues. He first talked about the liberation of productive forces and technological reform in rural areas and agriculture. He said that the national liberation and land reform liberated productive forces from the feudal exploitation system. Subsequently, the realization of agricultural cooperation achieved a victory in the socialist revolution in terms of the ownership of agricultural means of production, and further liberated productive forces from the small private ownership of individual farmers. Since the second half of last year, the socialist education movement and the rectification and construction of communes launched in rural areas have, through great airing of views, great debates, and great character posters, shattered the rumors and slanders of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements against socialism and their attacks; criticized the wavering of some well-to-do middle peasants towards socialism and their spontaneous capitalist tendencies, and strengthened the determination of the broad masses of peasants to take the socialist road, and achieved a victory in the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts, thoroughly liberating productive forces.

Liao Luyan said, what is productive force? It is the laborer plus the means of production, as well as the objects of labor. From the agricultural point of view, it is the peasants plus agricultural tools and land. The broad masses of peasants are currently showing an unprecedented level of enthusiasm and creativity. Last year, 65 counties and cities across the country achieved the grain production targets of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program ten years ahead of schedule, and 56 counties and cities achieved the cotton production targets ten years ahead of schedule. The grain and cotton production plans of the First Five-Year Plan have been overfulfilled. A larger-scale production upsurge is continuing to develop, and the peasants are striving for a great leap forward in production! These are all proofs of the unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of the peasants.

A greater leap forward and a higher degree of development of production are the urgent demands of the broad masses after the transformation of production relations. To improve productivity, in addition to continuing to promote the enthusiasm of laborers on the basis of the victorious socialist revolution, it is also necessary to improve the production technology of laborers and reform production tools. This is the urgent demand of the broad masses at present.

The road of technological reform is very long. The promotion of double-wheel double-share plows and other new agricultural tools is the beginning, and we must gradually transition to agricultural mechanization. For technological reforms, everything that develops productive forces should be promoted, not hindered. Not only should it be this way now, but it should be this way at all times.

	We Must Restore the Reputation of Double-Share Plows

The second issue Liao Luyan discussed was about "restoring the reputation" of double-share plows and actively promoting them. He said that the double-share plow is a good thing. Its advantages have been discussed by everyone in many ways, which can be summarized as:

(1) Plowing is deep, flat, stable, and even. Soil is turned better, soil covering is tighter, crop plant roots are deeper, fertilizer absorption area is wider, drought resistance is better, and growth is better, so production is increased. It can plow hard soil, which is conducive to drought-resistant cultivation. Plowing is faster, which is conducive to seizing the season, so it is also conducive to increasing production. The examples of increased production reflected at the meeting show that its increase range is 5% to 30%, 40%.

(2) Saving manpower and animal power. Many typical examples prove that the old plow requires twice the cattle power and two to three times the manpower of the double-share plow. The manpower and animal power saved by using the double-share plow can be used to expand production.

(3) Reducing labor intensity. Many examples prove that women and semi-laborers can also use double-share plows to cultivate fields. This improves the utilization rate of labor and is also conducive to increasing production.

(4) The double-share plow is also one of the material foundations for consolidating agricultural cooperatives. Increasing production, increasing income, increasing public accumulation, and promoting the increasing consolidation of agricultural cooperatives.

The double-share plow is a good thing and must be actively promoted. Facts have proved that all the so-called excuses for not being able to promote it are unfounded. The so-called "paddy fields cannot be used," "mountain land cannot be used," "cannot plow the edges of fields" and other statements have now been broken by facts. Is the double-share plow really "too heavy"? Not so. The test results with a dynamometer show that the pulling force per unit area of ​​the double-share plow and the pulling force borne by each cow are not greater than that of the old plow. There is also an argument of "inconvenient operation", which can be solved by combining with land planning, leveling the land, appropriately widening roads, or temporarily adding a single wheel for operation.

Some people say, "Cow power is insufficient." This can be solved by breeding cattle and comprehensively utilizing cattle. The income of agricultural cooperatives that raise cattle has increased, so they are naturally willing to increase breeding. Others say, "Cows are not suitable for yoking." This can be trained and is not difficult. Many examples show that it only takes a few days to train them to be able to yoke together.

Some people also say that buying double-share plows "does not conform to the principle of running cooperatives diligently and frugally." This is a one-sided statement. Those who say this have neither combined increased production to calculate the total account, nor calculated the total account according to the service life, but only saw that the one-time payment for buying a plow is more. Therefore, all these excuses are unfounded. Double-share plows must be actively promoted. Of course, this does not mean that double-share plows can be used for every piece of the country's 1.7 billion acres of cultivated land, or that they must be used. Nor does it mean that the double-share plow has no shortcomings and does not need any improvement. However, one cannot use the excuse of adapting to local conditions or the excuse of needing "modification" to take a negative attitude towards promoting double-share plows. This negative attitude is still a manifestation of conservative thinking.

Why was the reputation of the double-share plow once very "stinky" and even "plows returned"? According to the explanations from various places, the main reason is ideological problems. The "small typhoon" and "anti-rash advance" that swept up since the second half of last year were the evil doings of right-leaning conservative thought. The source of conservative thought and "small typhoons" is the reflection of the resistance of wealthy peasants to socialism, the reflection of the conservative thoughts and habits of peasants, and the mischief of rightist elements. Some of us in the business sector also have this conservative thinking, either because the revolutionary vigor is not enough, or because we don't have a clue and cannot "bravely stand up against" the typhoon. We should also have self-criticism. The Ministry of Agriculture must conduct self-examination and criticism.

In addition, some work has not been done well in the promotion process. For example, technical training, agricultural tool training, quality problems of some plows, repair problems, parts problems, etc. If these tasks are not done well, it is the responsibility of our business departments. Of course, these shortcomings are not completely avoidable, mainly because of the views and attitudes towards these shortcomings, mainly because of the mischief of right-leaning conservative thought.

	Do a Good Job in Promoting Double-Share Plows

Liao Luyan said, how to do a good job in promoting double-share plows? According to the experience of various places, the first step is to solve ideological problems. We must recognize the role of double-share plows and other new agricultural tools in the transition from semi-mechanization to mechanization. We must widely publicize the effect of double-share plows on increasing production and generally introduce solutions to new problems arising from the use of double-share plows, such as cow power, operation, and plowing the edges of fields.

Second, technical problems must be solved. Agricultural tool operators must be seriously trained to learn the techniques of using, installing, minor repairs, and plowing the edges of fields; plowing cattle must be trained, and difficulties in repairs and parts must be solved.

Third, land planning and land leveling should be carried out, small hills should be merged into large hills, and roads should be appropriately widened to meet the needs of double-share plow cultivation. In doing the above work, efforts should be made to minimize the loss of cultivated land, calculate the total account, and increase the area of cultivated land.

Fourth, the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives should also adapt to the needs of promoting double-share plows. We must promote the implementation of fixed people, fixed plows, fixed cattle, fixed fields, fixed time, fixed tillage quality, fixed work points, fixed feeding standards, and guarantees for cattle, plows, and teaching technology. The sayings vary from place to place, and there is no need to force uniformity. The content should include these aspects. It is also possible to form a double-share plow cultivation team (group) or a semi-mechanized production team in conjunction with other new agricultural tools.

Fifth, regarding the issue of leadership methods, leaders should pay attention, personally get involved, make typical examples, on-site demonstrations (visits, meetings), from point to surface, and actively promote. Cadres of agricultural departments going to the countryside, as well as cadres of counties, districts, townships, and cadres of technical service stations, everyone must learn to use, install, and make minor repairs to double-share plows.

In the promotion work, we must also follow the mass line. Coercive orders and tailism are opposed to the mass line and must be opposed.

Sixth, in order to do a good job in promotion, a certain organizational structure must be established, especially in counties, districts, townships, and communes. A promotion committee, technical committee, or group should be established, and specific personnel should be assigned to do this work. Some places have already introduced their experiences in this regard, and the provinces can ask the provincial party committee and the provincial people's committee to decide whether to adopt them after careful consideration. In addition, all relevant departments must closely cooperate and be responsible for their respective tasks.

Liao Luyan said that there were 14 styles brought by the provinces attending the meeting for the issue of modification. After trial cultivation, technical personnel made technical appraisals to explain their advantages and disadvantages as a basis for further research and improvement. It seems that some minor changes are not a big problem; some major changes, while creating some new advantages (which is good), have also changed some of the original advantages (which is not good). Further research is needed.

He said that the direction of improvement should be: (1) for the needs of regional adaptability; (2) to maintain the original excellent characteristics of the double-share plow; (3) to combine the masses and technical personnel to study and improve in actual use, not to change randomly without purpose, nor should one wait for modification and take a negative attitude towards promotion. Except for fields that are indeed unusable, those that are suitable should be actively promoted, and those that do not have all the conditions should actively create conditions to promote them. New agricultural tools should not stop moving forward, and technological improvement is endless.

Experimentation and research on new and old agricultural tools should be encouraged. Provinces should establish agricultural tool research institutes. Technical personnel should actively research, and experimentation and research should be allowed to flourish without fear of failure; the finalization of production and promotion should be cautious. Some provinces have proposed that counties should establish agricultural tool experiment stations (adopting the method of running experimental fields and relying on agricultural cooperatives to run them). This is a good method. The provinces should ask the provincial party committee and the provincial people's committee to decide to implement it. Agricultural tools are regional. Whether the improved new and old agricultural tools are mature and whether they can be officially produced and promoted should generally be decided by the province. Relevant central departments should strengthen the exchange of experience.

He also said that regarding the plan for the promotion of double-share plows in the Second Five-Year Plan and in 1958, the provinces have reported figures, and the meeting will not make any decisions on this. It seems that after everyone returns to their provinces and after discussion and active promotion work, the reported figures will still increase. At present, it is necessary to do a good job in regional adjustment to meet the needs of spring plowing. We must also consider the preparation for manufacturing. In addition, there may be some problems in this year's upsurge and large-scale promotion. We must be mentally prepared. We must adhere to what is right, accept correct criticism, and "stand up against" inappropriate accusations.

	Achieving Mechanization Mainly Depends on the Strength of the Masses

The third issue Liao Luyan discussed was about agricultural mechanization and the sending of machines to the countryside. He said that our task is to build a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. Modern agriculture is agricultural mechanization, electrification, chemicalization, and scientification. So-called agricultural mechanization includes machines for power, tillage, irrigation and drainage, transportation, processing, and also animal husbandry machinery, fishing machinery, and so on. We must gradually transition from semi-mechanization to mechanization; we must transition from machines powered by human and animal power to machines powered by machines.

Achieving mechanization mainly depends on the strength of the masses and agricultural cooperatives. Taking the management mode of machine tractors as an example, it can have several forms: state-owned and state-operated, state-owned and commune-operated, jointly owned and operated by the state and the commune, and commune-owned and commune-operated. The latter forms will be the main mode of development in the future. Therefore, all localities should formulate agricultural mechanization plans, and when formulating agricultural mechanization plans, they must consider it in conjunction with the accumulation of cooperatives.

Achieving agricultural mechanization means sending machines to the countryside. Sending machines to the countryside is a matter of great economic significance and great political significance. It is the beginning of gradually eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas and the differences between workers and peasants. All localities should fully recognize its significance.

Liao Luyan finally said that under the leadership of the Party, Chinese peasants have undergone long-term revolutionary training, have strong organizational skills, have a high degree of awareness, have a tradition of diligence and thrift, have been organized in accordance with socialist principles, and will now continue to produce a new generation of cultured peasants (including hundreds of thousands of cadres going to the countryside). With machines, these hundreds of millions of peasants will undoubtedly create miracles that have never been seen in human history. Not only can we achieve the requirements of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, but also increase the unit area yield of our country's agriculture to the highest level in the world.

### 推广双铧犁　提高生产力  廖鲁言在南方双轮双铧犁会议上的讲话

    推广双铧犁　提高生产力
    廖鲁言在南方双轮双铧犁会议上的讲话
    新华社黄岩2日电　农业部部长廖鲁言28日在南方双轮双铧犁
  改装评比和推广使用经验交流会上的讲话中说，这次现场会议的目的是恢复双轮双铧犁的名誉，交流经验，积极推广。这个目的达到了。经过这次会议一定会更促进双铧犁的推广工作，不仅对南方各省，对北方各省也将起促进的作用。
      推广双铧犁是技术改革的开始
    廖鲁言接着谈了以下三个问题。他首先谈的是在农村、农业方面，生产力的解放与技术改革的问题。他说，全国解放和土地改革，从封建的剥削制度下解放了生产力；其后，实现农业合作化，在农业生产资料的所有制方面，取得了社会主义革命的胜利，又从个体农民的小私有制下进一步解放了生产力。从去年下半年以来，在农村展开的社会主义教育运动和整风整社，通过大鸣大放大辩论，击破了地主、富农、反革命分子和其它坏分子对社会主义的造谣污蔑和进攻；批判了一部分富裕中农对社会主义的动摇和资本主义自发倾向，坚定了广大农民走社会主义道路的决心，在思想战线上和政治战线上取得了社会主义革命的胜利，彻底的解放了生产力。
    廖鲁言说，生产力是什么？就是劳动者加生产工具，还有劳动对象。从农业方面来说，就是农民加农具和土地。广大农民目前表现出从来没有看见过的积极性和创造性。去年，全国有六十五个县市的粮食产量和五十六个县市的棉花产量提前十年达到了全国农业发展纲要修正草案的产量指标，第一个五年计划的粮、棉产量计划已经超额完成。当前一个规模更大的生产高潮正在继续发展，农民们力争生产大跃进！这些都是农民积极性空前高涨的证明。
    更大的跃进，更高度的发展生产，是生产关系变革以后广大群众的迫切要求。提高生产力，除了在胜利实现社会主义革命的基础上，继续发扬劳动者的积极性以外，还要提高劳动者的生产技术和改革生产工具，这是广大群众当前的迫切要求。
    技术改革的途程很长，推广双轮双铧犁和其他新式农具等等是开始，还要逐步地向农业机械化过渡。对于技术改革，凡是发展生产力的一切东西都应该促进，不能促退。不仅现在应该这样，任何时候都应该这样。
            要为双铧犁恢复名誉
    廖鲁言谈的第二个问题是关于为双铧犁“恢复名誉”，积极推广双铧犁的问题。他说，双铧犁是好东西，它的优越性，大家讲了很多条，概括起来表现在：
    （1）耕得深、平、稳、匀，翻土较好，盖土较严，作物植株根扎得深，吸肥面宽，耐旱，长得好，所以增产；能耕死板田土，有利于抗旱耕种；耕得快，有利于抢季节；所以也有利于增产。会议上反映的增产实例说明，它的增产幅度是5％到30％、40％。
    （2）节省人力和畜力。许多典型例子证明，旧犁比双铧犁牛力费一倍，人力费二倍到三倍。使用双铧犁节省出的人力和畜力，又可用来扩大生产。
      （3）减轻劳动强度，许多实例证明，妇女和半劳动力也可用双铧犁耕田，这就是提高了劳动力的利用率，也有利于增加生产。
      （4）双铧犁也是巩固农业合作社的物质基础之一。增加生产，增加收入，增加公共积累，促进农业合作社越来越巩固。
    双铧犁是好东西，必须积极推广。事实证明，所谓不能推广的种种借口都是没有根据的。所谓“水田不能用”、“山地不能用”、“不能耕田边地角”等等说法，现在都已被事实打破了。双铧犁真的“太笨重”吗？并非如此。用拉力表试验结果，双铧犁单位面积的拉力和每头牛负担的拉力并不比旧犁大。还有一种“不便运行”的论调，这可以用与土地规划、平整土地相结合，适当加宽道路来解决，也可以临时加个独轮来运行。
    有人说，“牛力不足”，这可以繁殖牛，综合利用牛；养牛的农业社收益增加了，自然愿意增殖。又有人说：“牛不合犋”，这是可以训练的，也不难，许多例子说明，只要几天就可以训练得能够合犋。
    还有人说，购买双铧犁“不合乎勤俭办社的原则”，这是片面的说法。说这种话的人既没有结合增产算总账，也没有按使用年限算总账，而只看到买犁时一次出钱较多。所以，这种种借口都是没有根据的。双铧犁必须积极推广。当然，这不是说，全国十七亿亩耕地，块块都能用双铧犁，都必须用双铧犁；也不是说，双铧犁已经没有任何缺点，不需要任何改进了。但是不能借口因地制宜，借口需要“改装”，而对推广双铧犁抱消极态度，这种消极态度仍是保守思想的表现。
    过去，双铧犁的名誉为什么一度很“臭”，甚至“退犁”？根据各地发言说明，主要是思想问题。从去年下半年以来刮起的一阵“小台风”和“反冒进”，是右倾保守思想在作怪。保守思想、“小台风”的由来是，富裕农民对社会主义抵触情绪的反映，农民的保守思想和习惯势力的反映，以及右派分子的兴风作浪。我们业务部门本身也有的有这种保守思想，或者是由于革命的朝气还不足，或者心中无数，而不能在台风面前“硬着头皮顶住”。我们也应该有自我批评，农业部就要进行自我检查和批评。
    此外，在推广中，也的确有些工作做得不够好。例如，技术传授、农具手训练、有些犁的质量问题、修理问题、配件问题等等。这些工作没有做好，更是我们业务部门的责任。当然，这些缺点不是完全可以避免的，主要还是对这些缺点的看法和态度，主要是右倾保守思想作祟。
          做好双铧犁的推广工作
    廖鲁言说，怎样做好双铧犁的推广工作呢？根据各地的经验，首先要解决思想问题，必须认识双铧犁和其他新式农具在由半机械化到机械化的过渡中所起的作用，要广泛宣传双铧犁增产的效果，普遍介绍使用双铧犁所产生的牛力、运行、耕田边地角等等新问题的解决办法。
    其次，要解决技术问题。要认真的训练农具手，学会使用、安装、小修和耕田边地角的技术；要训练耕牛，还要解决修理和配零件的困难等等。
    第三，要进行土地规划，土地平整，小丘并大丘，适当加宽道路，以适应双铧犁耕作的需要。在作上述工作中，应该力争少损失耕地，算总账，应该增加耕地面积。
    第四，农业合作社经营管理也要适应推广双铧犁的需要。要推行定人、定犁、定牛、定田、定时、定耕作质量、定工分、定饲养标准，以及保牛、保犁、保教会技术等等几定几保，各地说法不一，不必强求一律，内容要包括这几方面。组成双铧犁耕田队（组），或者结合其它新式农具，组成半机械化生产队也是可以的。
    第五，关于领导方法问题，要领导重视，亲自动手，做出典型，现场示范（参观、开会），由点到面，积极推广。农业部门下乡的干部，以及县区乡干部，技术服务站的干部，人人都要学会使用、安装和小修双铧犁。
    在推广工作中，还必须走群众路线。强迫命令和尾巴主义都是同群众路线对立的，都要反对。
    第六，为了做好推广工作，要成立一定的组织机构，特别是县区乡社，应该成立推广委员会、技术委员会或小组，并确定专人作这个工作。有些地方已经介绍了这方面的经验，各省可请示省委、省人民委员会决定，斟酌采用。此外，各有关部门还必须密切合作，分工负责。
    廖鲁言说，关于改装问题，这次到会的省带来的式样有十四种。经过试耕，都由技术人员做出技术鉴定，说明其优缺点，做为进一步研究改进的依据。看来，一些小改的，问题不大；一些大改的，固然创造出某些新的优点（这是好的），但是也改掉了原有的某些优点（这就不好了）。还须继续研究。
    他说，改进的方向应该是：（1）为着地区适应性的需要；（2）保持双铧犁原有的优良的特性；（3）在实际使用中，群众与技术人员相结合来研究改进，不能无目的乱改，也不应该等待改装，而对推广抱消极态度。除了确实不能使用的田土以外，适用的应该积极推广，有些条件不完全具备的，应该积极创造条件，加以推广。新式农具也不要停止不前，技术改进是无止境的。
    对新旧农具的试验研究工作要加以鼓励。省应成立农具研究所。技术人员要积极研究，试验研究要百花齐放，不怕失败；定型生产推广则要慎重。有的省提出县县设立农具试验站（采取办试验田的办法，依托农业合作社办），这是好办法。各省请示省委、省人民委员会决定进行。农具是有地区性的。改进的新旧农具，是否成熟和是否可以正式生产推广，一般的应该由省决定。中央有关部门要加强经验交流。
    他又说，关于第二个五年计划和1958年的推广双铧犁的计划，各省已报了数字，会议对此不做什么决定。看来，大家回省以后，经过讨论和积极开展推广工作以后，已报的数字，还会增加的。当前要做好地区调剂，适应春耕的需要。也要考虑准备制造问题。此外，在今年的高潮、大推广中，还可能出点毛病，要有精神准备，对的要坚持，正确的批评要接受，不恰当的责难要“顶住”。
        实现机械化主要依靠群众力量
    廖鲁言谈的第三个问题是关于农业机械化和机器下乡的问题。他说，我们的任务是建设一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。现代农业就是农业机械化、电气化、化学化和科学化。所谓农业机械化，包括的机械有动力机械、耕作机械、排灌机械、运输机械、加工机械，还有畜牧机械、捕鱼机械等等。要逐步地由半机械化过渡到机械化；要从以人力、畜力做动力的机械过渡到机器动力的机械。
    实现机械化，主要靠群众、靠农业合作社的力量来办。以机器拖拉机的经营方式为例，它可以有几种形式：国有国营、国有社营、国社合有合营、社有社营，今后的发展将以后面的几种为主要的方式。因此，各地要制定农业机械化规划，而在制定农业机械化规划的时候，必须与合作社的积累合并考虑。
    实现农业机械化便是机器下乡。机器下乡是具有伟大的经济意义和伟大的政治意义的事，是逐步消灭城乡差别、工农差别的开始。各地应该充分地认识到它的意义。
    廖鲁言最后说，中国农民在党的领导下，有长期革命的锻炼，组织性强，觉悟程度较高，有勤劳俭朴的传统，已经按照社会主义的原则组织起来，现在已将不断产生新的一代有文化的农民（包括成百万的下乡干部），再有了机器，这样的几万万农民，无疑将创造出人类有史以来没有看见过的奇迹。不仅可以提前实现全国农业发展纲要修正草案的要求，而且可以把我国农业的单位面积产量提高到世界最高的水平。
