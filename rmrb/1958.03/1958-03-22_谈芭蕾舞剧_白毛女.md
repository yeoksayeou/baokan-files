    Discussing the Ballet "The White Haired Girl"
    Ouyang Yuqian (text) Ye Qianyu (sketch)
    Japanese progressive artists, in the arduous environment where American imperialist decadent and degenerate invasion culture that anesthetizes the Japanese people fills the market, adhere to their positions and support performing troupes: some are devoted to promoting the excellent traditions of Japanese classical drama and classical dance; others use various art forms to create; actively provide the people with healthy, simple, fresh and lively art works for appreciation; and fight against the enemy. The Matsuyama Ballet Troupe is one of them. Due to economic difficulties, many actors in this troupe often have to find temporary jobs outside to maintain their lives. They only have one house, which has only one rehearsal room, two or three small rooms, and an old piano that is almost ready to be put in a museum; even this small amount of property, they had mortgaged it to stage "The White Haired Girl." Despite this, they are full of optimism and happily carry out their own creations. They have ideals, hopes, plans, and their own unique artistic style; through continuous struggle, they have gained the support of the broad masses. In the preparatory process they published for staging "The White Haired Girl," there are these few sentences: "We hope to establish a new creation method in Japan through this performance. When we want to turn the outstanding ideas of the original work into stage actions through ballet, the important task before us is: we must study acting based on the ideological foundation of the original work, create dramatic character images, and cultivate new qualities for ballet dancers. Through the tragic fate of The White Haired Girl, we express a person's tenacious vitality and strong inner emotions. This theme cannot be designed from a narrow biological perspective, but must be designed from a fighting perspective." From this, we can clearly see their creative ideas and methods, and see the goals of their struggle. They are serious, earnest, and have clear likes and dislikes.
    When Mr. Nakamura Kanjūrō told me the news that the ballet "The White Haired Girl" had been initially staged, I was amazed by the innovation and sent a telegram to congratulate them. In 1956, when I visited Ms. Mikiko Matsuyama in Tokyo, I was very moved just by watching a duet between Dachun and Xi'er in the first act, and I firmly believed that this creation was successful. At the same time, I also believed that it was entirely possible to reflect the lives of Eastern workers and peasants in the form of ballet. This time, I am very happy to be able to see the whole picture of this ballet in Beijing. The touching scenes of the Chinese audience after watching this ballet even more powerfully illustrate the success of this ballet.
    This ballet is adapted from the opera "The White Haired Girl." As a ballet, this is a quite brilliant creation. I think the arrangement is very good. The most difficult thing in adapting an opera into a ballet is to make appropriate cuts; to use the characteristics of ballet to grasp the main plot, to make the connecting movements particularly clear; to highly concentrate the image, and to prominently express the theme, the characters' personalities and emotions. The ballet "The White Haired Girl" is handled extremely concisely and powerfully, and thus appears very powerful and moving.
    In terms of performance, Ms. Mikiko Matsuyama showed excellent talent and skilled technique. Her movements are so beautiful and accurate, every move she makes is like speaking, clearly conveying the complex inner activities of the characters to the audience. People feel that she is indeed a simple and innocent rural girl, she has the gentle beauty of Eastern women; but when she is subjected to bullying, she immediately erupts with a strong flame, showing tenacious vitality.
    Mr. Taneomi Ishida's performance of Dachun is also very appropriate. Such a young male ballet dancer is really rare. He and Mikiko Matsuyama's acting have a common advantage: they do not show off their talents or act impulsively; they convey profound emotions with healthy and simple movements.
    Everyone said that Mr. Yasuo Komori's performance of Huang Shiren was good, saying that every move he made showed the image of a bully landlord. The other roles are also played very realistically. But it must be pointed out that all the actors exerted collective strength, and everyone's performance was to highlight the theme and complete the highest task, making the entire performance a complete work of art. This is not only due to the appropriate handling of the director, but also the efforts of the actors.
    I think the ballet, the arrangement of the dances, the changes in formations, and the stage scheduling are all very good. The whole play is full of strong emotions, a strong revolutionary atmosphere, and a strong oriental sentiment, deeply touching the Chinese audience. The directorial talent of Mr. Yoshi Hijikata can be seen everywhere.
    I don't understand music. But I like the music written by young composer Mr. Hikaru Hayashi for the ballet "The White Haired Girl." He developed the main melodies of the opera very well, making people feel kind and pleasant; I also think some of the orchestration is cleverly used. I feel that Hayashi's composition can help this ballet explain the problem.
    The Matsuyama Ballet Troupe's performance of "The White Haired Girl" has achieved great success in our country, making a great contribution to the cultural exchange between our two countries and further increasing the mutual understanding between the people of China and Japan. I sincerely thank them. (Attached picture)

    谈芭蕾舞剧“白毛女”
    欧阳予倩文  叶浅予速写
    日本进步的艺术家们，在美帝国主义腐朽堕落、麻醉日本人民的侵略文化充斥市场的艰苦环境中，坚持阵地，撑持着演出团体：有的致力于发扬日本古典戏剧和古典舞蹈的优良传统；有的利用多种的艺术形式进行创作；积极地以健康朴素、清新活泼的艺术作品供人民欣赏；并和敌人作斗争。松山芭蕾团就是其中的一个。这个团体由于经济困难，许多演员都经常要在外边找些临时工作维持生活。他们仅有一所房子，其中只有一间排练室，两三小间住房，一架差不多快进博物馆的旧钢琴；就是这一点财产，他们也曾为上演“白毛女”抵押出去过。尽管如此，他们充满着乐观的精神，愉快地进行着自己的创作。他们有理想、有希望、有计划、有自己独特的艺术风格；经过不断的奋斗，他们得到了广大群众的支持。在他们发表的上演“白毛女”的筹备经过中，有这样几句话：“我们希望通过这一演出，在日本首先树立一种新的创作方法。当我们要把原作的卓越思想，通过芭蕾舞变成舞台行动的时候，摆在我们面前重要的课题是：必须在原作的思想基础上学习演技，创造出具有戏剧性的人物形象，培养出芭蕾舞演员的新的品质。通过白毛女的悲惨运命表现出一个人的顽强的生命力以及强烈的内在感情。这一主题不可用狭隘的生物学的眼光来设计，必须用斗争的眼光来设计。”从这里可以明显地看出他们的创作思想和创作方法，看得出他们奋斗的目标。他们是严肃认真，爱憎分明的。
    当中村玩右卫门先生把芭蕾舞剧“白毛女”最初排成的消息告诉我时，我惊为创举；曾打了个电报去道贺。1956年我在东京访问松山树子女士时，只看了第一幕中大春和喜儿的一段双人舞便很感动，也肯定地认为这一创作是成功的，同时也相信用芭蕾的形式来反映东方工人农民的生活是完全可能的。这回能在北京看到这个舞剧的全貌使我非常高兴，中国观众看这个舞剧后的感动情景更有力地说明这个舞剧的成功。
    这个舞剧是根据歌剧“白毛女”改编的。作为舞剧，这是一个相当高明的创作。我觉得编排得很好，用歌剧改编舞剧最难的是与以适当的剪裁；要运用芭蕾的特点把握住主要情节，使贯串动作特别鲜明；要使形象高度集中，把主题思想、人物的性格感情突出地表现出来。芭蕾“白毛女”处理得异常简洁精练，也就显得十分有力、动人。
    在表演方面，松山树子女士显示了优秀的才能和熟练的技巧。她的动作是那样优美而准确，她的一举一动就像在那里说话，把剧中人物复杂的内心活动明确地传达给观众。使人感到她的确是一个纯朴而又天真活泼的农村少女，她具有东方女性温婉的美；但在她遭受欺凌时立即爆发出强烈的火焰，显示出顽强的生命力。
    石田种生先生演的大春也很适当，像他这样的舞剧小生真是十分难得。他和松山树子的演技有一个共同的优点，就是：不矜才，不使气；以健康朴素的动作传达出深厚的感情。
    演黄世仁的小森安雄先生，大家都说演得好，说他一举一动都表现出恶霸地主的形象。其余的角色也都演得很真实。但必须指出的是：全体演员发挥了集体的力量，每一个人的表演都为了突出主题，完成最高任务，使得整个演出成为一个完整的艺术作品。这不但是导演的处理适当，也是演员们的努力。
    我觉得这个舞剧、舞的安排、队形的变化和舞台调度都很好，全剧充满着强烈的感情，浓厚的革命气氛和浓厚的东方情调，深深地感动了中国观众。土方与志先生的导演才能随处可以看到。
    我是不懂音乐的。可是我欢喜青年作曲家林光先生为“白毛女”舞剧所写的曲子，他把歌剧的主要旋律发展得很好，使人觉得亲切悦耳；有些配器我也觉得用得聪明，我感觉林光的作曲能够帮助这个舞剧说明问题。
    松山树子芭蕾舞团演出的“白毛女”在我国的演出获得了很大的成功，它对我们两国的文化交流做出了很大的贡献，更增加了中日两国人民的相互了解。我衷心地感谢他们。（附图片）
