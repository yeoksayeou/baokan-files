The Expansion of "I" is Too Dangerous!
    —A Portrait of Chen Yi
    Wei Chuantong weaves lies to his face, gently and smoothly: "Individualism, who doesn't have a little..." His mouth is full of propriety, righteousness, and shame, but his heart is set on flattery and deception; he reaches out whenever he can, and drills through every loophole. For fame and fortune, he opens and closes, skillfully changes; he praises himself and opposes the leadership, in article after article. A dead pig is not afraid of boiling water, it is difficult to refuse criticism and reform; Liberalism aids him, and there is also a small "kingdom" circle... Cut out the abscess, the body is healthy, a bright mirror should hang high; what is the lesson? The expansion of "I" is too dangerous!

    “我”字扩张太危险！
    ——为陈沂画像
    魏传统当面编谎言，娓娓婉婉：“个人主义，哪个没一点……”满口礼义廉，一心拉拍骗；得伸手时且伸手，有了空子就要钻。为名为利，纵横开合机巧变；捧自己，反领导，一篇又一篇。死猪不怕开水烫，拒绝批评改造难；自由主义援助他，还有“王国”小圈圈……割脓疮，肌体健，明镜应高悬；什么是教训？“我”字扩张太危险！
