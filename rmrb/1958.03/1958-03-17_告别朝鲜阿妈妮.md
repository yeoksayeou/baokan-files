    Farewell to Korean Mother
   I. Mother, I'm about to leave you. How could I forget that in the war years you poured warm water into my mouth,
  used scorched half-bedding quilts,
  wrapped my frozen body,
  and added your cotton-padded coat... Mother, today we are leaving here, how can I forget the mother in white? We say: "Mother is even closer than our own mother." What blesses you is
  red azalea flowers,
  songs of peace.
  Blooming all over Korea,
  singing throughout three thousand miles.
      Volunteer Soldier Jiang Bangrui
    II. The troop set off, and Mother saw us off for a distance,
      another mile, "Don't see us off anymore, Mother!" Mother didn't answer, walking up the hillside with her kind eyes following our backs. We turned our heads back and bowed with every step, our hands are too short, alas, unable to wave too high. What answers you is the song:
  Beijing, Pyongyang...
  Mao Zedong, Kim Il Sung...
  Friendship forged with flesh and blood.
        Volunteer Soldier Jiang Bangrui
    III. Farewell, Mother, your Chinese son (1) is about to leave you tomorrow. How many years has it been? Drinking the water in front of your house, living on the land behind your house, even the clothes on my body are washed and mended by you. During the four seasons and eight festivals, you invite us to your house, bring out the *zhanji* you made by hand (2), saying again and again: "This is your *jipi*!" (3) Farewell, Mother, although I will leave you tomorrow, we will always remember your deep affection for your Chinese son in our hearts.
        Volunteer Soldier Tong Fu
  (Note 1) *Ade'er*, Korean for "son."
  (Note 2) A kind of spicy and sour pickled vegetable.
  (Note 3) *Jipi*, Korean for "home."

    告别朝鲜阿妈妮
   一阿妈妮，要离开您了。我怎会忘记在战争的年月里您用温开水灌进我的嘴，
  用烧焦的半床棉被，
  裹住我冻僵的身体，
  外加上您的棉衣……阿妈妮，今天我们离开这里我怎能忘记白衣的妈妈？我们说：“阿妈妮比亲娘还亲。”祝福您的是
  红色的金达莱花，
  和平的歌声。
  开遍全朝鲜，
  唱遍三千里。
      志愿军战士　蒋邦瑞
    二队伍出发了阿妈妮送了一程
      又是一里，“不要送了吧，阿妈妮！”阿妈不答话，走上山坡慈祥的眼光跟着我们的背影。我们一步一回头，一步一答礼，我们的手太短了啊不能挥动得太高。回答您的是歌声：
  北京，平壤……
  毛泽东，金日成……
  用血肉结成的友谊。
        志愿军战士　蒋邦瑞
    三别了，阿妈妮您的中国阿得儿（一）明天就要离开你。几年啦？吃的你家门前水，住的你家屋后地，连身上穿的也是你洗净补好的衣。四时八节你都邀我们上你家端出亲手做的沾鸡（二），一次一次地说：“这儿就是你们的基皮！”（三）别了，阿妈妮，虽然明天就要离开你，但你对中国阿得儿的深情，我们会永远记在心里。
        志愿军战士　彤夫
  （注一）阿得儿，朝鲜语“儿子”。
  （注二）一种酸辣的咸菜。
  （注三）基皮，朝鲜语“家”。
