    Reader's Letters
    Editor's Note: While the nationwide advanced commercial workers are setting off a "catching up with Tianjin" wind and advancing rapidly, some "slow oxen" are still stuck in their old ways, remaining in place. To urge these "slow oxen" to catch up as soon as possible, readers have written many enthusiastic and well-meaning criticisms. We are publishing some of these letters here. We believe that the concern of the broad masses will help commercial workers achieve a comprehensive leap forward more quickly.
    What Kind of Management Style Is This?
    On February 9th, I bought a child's hat at the Shanghai State-Owned Children's Store. When I got home, I found the color was very unsuitable, and the next day I went to ask to exchange it for a different style. The salesperson's attitude was very blunt, saying, "You chose the hat yourself. Items from state-owned companies are not returned once they leave the store." I then went to see their team leader. This team leader's attitude was equally blunt, saying, "State-owned company goods only go out, they don't come back in. If you don't like the color, you can buy another style you like." The third day, I went to see their manager. Unexpectedly, this manager also said, "This hat can be worn by a child. Saying the color is not good is just a problem with your adult thinking. If the child says he doesn't want to wear this hat, then I will exchange it for you." Heaven knows, my child is only eight months old, what can he say? Then the manager said, "If you don't want this hat, I can turn the hat money of two yuan, two jiao, and four fen over to the national treasury." I really don't understand, is this the kind of management style and service attitude that state-owned stores should have?

    Dining Regulations
    In Bengbu City, no traveler doesn't have a headache when it comes to eating. The business hours of the city's catering industry are all the same: 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM; 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM; 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM. This is very inconvenient for travelers coming and going. Restaurants are not like agency canteens, why not arrange the business hours in a staggered way?
    There is also a bad trend of rigid pairings in the Bengbu City catering industry. For example, in the Jinshan Restaurant, customers must order a meat dish to eat, and are only allowed to eat two bowls of rice. If they eat one more bowl, they have to buy another stir-fried dish. If this is done to limit grain sales, they could consider collecting grain coupons for eating in the restaurant, but it is said that they do this to make money. A waiter in the restaurant told us that the profit from stir-fried dishes is around 50%. I ask, does this comply with the operating principles of socialist enterprises?

    读者来信
    编者按　在全国先进的商业工作者掀起“赶天桥”之风快马前进的时候，却有一些“慢牛”依然故我，在原地不动。为了督促这些“慢牛”尽快赶上去，读者写来了不少热情的善意的批评。我们在这里摘发了其中的几封。我们相信，广大群众的关怀，将能帮助商业工作者更快地实现全面的跃进。
    这是什么经营作风？
    2月9日，我在上海市国营儿童商店买一顶童帽，回家后发觉花色很不合适，第二天去要求调换一个式样。营业员的态度非常生硬，说：“帽子是你自己挑选的，国营公司的东西出门不换”。我又去找他们的小组长。这位组长的态度同样生硬，说：“国营公司的商品只出不进，如嫌花色不好，你可再买一顶式样满意的”。第三天，我又去见他们的经理。想不到这位经理也说：“这顶帽子小孩可以戴，说花色不好只是你们大人的思想问题，假使小孩说这顶帽子不要戴，就给你换。”天晓得，我的孩子只有八个月，他能说些什么呢？接着这位经理又说：“你不要这顶帽子，我可以把帽款二元二角四分上缴国库。”我真不明白，难道这就是国营商店应有的经营作风和服务态度吗？

    吃饭的清规戒律
    在蚌埠市，一提起吃饭问题，没有一个旅客不头痛。全市饮食业的营业时间都一个样：早八点至十点；中午十二点至下午二点；下午五点至晚八点。这对来往旅客非常不方便。饭馆不是机关食堂，为什么不把营业时间穿插安排一下呢？
    蚌埠市饮食业中还有一种硬性搭配的坏风气。例如金山饭店，顾客吃饭，非炒一个荤菜不可，而且只允许吃两碗米饭，如果多吃一碗，还得再买一个炒菜。这样做如果是为了限制粮食销量，可以考虑在饭馆吃饭收粮票，可是据说，他们这样做的目的是为了赚钱。饭店的一位服务员告诉我们，炒菜的利润在50％左右。试问，这符合社会主义企业的经营原则吗？
