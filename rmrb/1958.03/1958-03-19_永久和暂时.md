    Permanent and Temporary
    Lin Ling
    The Communist Party has always been called the most radical party by its enemies. However, George Bernard Shaw once said in his humorous tone: The Communist Party is the most conservative party in the world, because it still adheres to the program declared by Marx and Engels in the "Communist Manifesto" more than a hundred years ago. Is this correct?
    The "Communist Manifesto" was published one hundred and ten years ago, and Marx, one of the drafters of the manifesto, has been gone for three-quarters of a century today. One hundred and ten years and seventy-five years are not short periods. In the past hundred years, especially in the past forty years, earth-shaking changes have taken place in the world. However, the longer Marx has been gone and the more changes have occurred in the world, the more powerfully it proves the correctness of Marxism.
    Some people say that Marxism is outdated because it is a theory created a hundred years ago. However, in a quarter of the world's land, the one-third of humanity building socialism proves every day with new facts that Marxism is not only not aging but has a vigorous and incomparably powerful vitality. Because dialectical materialism, which is the theoretical foundation of Marxism, is applicable to the past, present, and future.
    Everything depends on conditions, location, and time. Therefore, dialectical materialism, which demonstrates this revolutionary truth, is not limited by conditions, location, and time—it is a permanent and universal truth.
    In the past, many emperors in history, not satisfied with enjoying all the wealth and glory of the world, wanted to prolong this wealth and glory and maintain it permanently, so they sought immortals and medicines in the hope of achieving immortality. Of course, none of them achieved "eternal life."
    Since everything in the world is in constant motion and development, and even the social order will not be "unchanging for all ages," let alone individual life. Individual life is temporary, and the life of the collective people is permanent.
    Today, aren't the imperialist capitalists still foolishly dreaming of proving that capitalism is the most ideal system in the world and that it will be permanently unchanged? However, Marx said in the "Communist Manifesto" one hundred and ten years ago: "You transform the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property—historical relations that rise and disappear in the progress of production—into eternal laws of nature and of reason." In fact, this kind of biased view "has been common to all ruling classes that have preceded you." Ancient social property rights and feudal social property rights disappeared with the demise of ancient society and feudal society. The bourgeoisie does not doubt this when reading this history, but they are blinded by money, and when they talk about their property rights, they say that capitalist society is a permanently unchanging system.
    The imperialist bourgeoisie refuses to admit the facts even when they see them: today's socialist camp has gained the upper hand, and the strength of the socialist world has surpassed the strength of the capitalist world. In the past hundred years, the Western capitalist countries, which have been blowing the wind of aggression towards the East, are now being overwhelmed by the revolutionary wind and the wind of peace from the Eastern socialist countries. The East wind has prevailed over the West wind.
    To insist that something temporary is permanent is to deceive oneself and will inevitably lead to bankruptcy in the end. Marx had already predicted this, and now there is even more evidence. This scientific prediction was forged by Marx and Engels more than a hundred years ago as dialectical materialism. In the hands of the proletariat, dialectical materialism has become an invincible weapon, but it is not a magic weapon that only the proletariat can wield. It is an open weapon that anyone can use. The problem is that if the bourgeoisie picks up this weapon, it will harm itself and make itself surrender without a fight, because this weapon is like a demon-revealing mirror, clearly showing that the imperialist bourgeoisie is bound to perish and must give way to the emerging proletariat and give way to the socialist world.
    1958 has three Marxist anniversaries: the 110th anniversary of the publication of the "Communist Manifesto" on February 28, the 75th anniversary of Marx's death on March 14, and the 140th anniversary of Marx's birth on May 5. These anniversaries seem to be deliberately brought together, symbolizing that the world situation has entered a new turning point, symbolizing that the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, symbolizing the beginning of a new century of dividing paragraphs and epochs where the old is withering and the new is growing vigorously.

    永久和暂时
    林陵
    共产党向来被敌人称为最急进的政党。但是萧伯纳却曾经用他的幽默的调子说过：共产党是世界上最保守的政党，因为它至今还坚持着马克思和恩格斯在一百多年前在“共产党宣言”里所宣布的纲领。这话对不对呢？
    “共产党宣言”是在一百十年前问世的，宣言起草人之一马克思，到今天也离开我们整整四分之三世纪了。一百十年和七十五年，并不是一个短暂的时间，近一百年来，特别是近四十年来，世界上发生了地复天翻的大变化，然而，马克思离开我们愈久，世界发生的变化愈多，却愈加有力地证明马克思主义的正确性。
    有人说，马克思主义已经陈旧过时了，因为它是一百年前创立的学说。但是，在全球四分之一的土地上建设着社会主义的全人类三分之一的人每天用新的事实证明马克思主义非但没有衰老过时，而且有着朝气蓬勃的强大无比的生命力。因为作为马克思主义理论基础的辩证唯物主义，既适用于过去，也适用于现在，适用于将来。
    一切都依条件、地点、时间为转移。因而论证这一革命真理的辩证唯物主义也就不受条件、地点、时间的限制，——它是永久的普遍的真理。
    过去历史上有许多帝王，享尽人间富贵还不满足，又想把这种富贵延长下去，维持永久，于是求仙求药，以冀长生不老。结果当然都没有得到“永生”。
    既然世界的一切都在不断运动和发展中，连社会秩序都不会“永世不移”，何况个人的生命。个人的生命是暂时的，集体的人民的生命才是永久的。
    今天帝国主义资本家不还是在痴人说梦似的证明资本主义是世界上最理想的制度，它将永久不变么？然而马克思在一百十年前就在“共产党宣言”里说：“你们把你们的生产关系和所有制关系从生产发展过程中暂时历史性的关系夸大成为永久的自然法则和理性法则”，其实这种偏颇的观念，“先前所有一切灭亡了的统治阶级也都有过”。古代社会财产所有权，封建社会财产所有权都随着古代社会和封建社会的消灭而消灭了，资产阶级读这段历史时并不怀疑，可是他们财迷心窍，一谈到自己的财产权时就说资本主义社会是永久不变的制度。
    帝国主义资产阶级眼看着事实而不肯承认是事实：今天的社会主义阵营已经占了上风，社会主义世界的力量已经超过资本主义世界的力量，近百年来，一直向东方吹着侵略之风的西方资本主义国家，现在被东方社会主义国家的革命之风、和平之风压过了，东风压倒西风了。
    本来是暂时的东西，硬要说是永久的东西，这是自欺欺人，最后必然破产。关于这一点，马克思早已预言过，现在更有事实证明了。这种科学预见是马克思、恩格斯在一百多年前铸造的辩证唯物主义。辩证唯物主义在无产阶级手里，已成为战无不胜的武器，但是它并不是只有无产阶级才能祭起使用的法宝，它是谁都可以拿去使用的公开武器，问题是资产阶级拿起这件武器就会伤害自己，就会使自己不战而降，因为这件武器像一面照妖镜，它清清楚楚地照出，帝国主义资产阶级必然要灭亡，必然要让位给新兴的无产阶级，让位给社会主义世界。
    1958年有马克思主义的三个纪念日：2月28日的“共产党宣言”发表一百十周年纪念日，3月14日的马克思逝世七十五周年纪念日，5月5日马克思诞生一百四十周年纪念日，这些纪念日像故意凑在一起似的，象征着世界形势进入了一个新的转折点，象征着东风压倒了西风，象征着旧的萎亡，新的茁长的分段落、划时代的新世纪的开始。
