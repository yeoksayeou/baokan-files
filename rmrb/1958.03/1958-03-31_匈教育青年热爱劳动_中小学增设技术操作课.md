Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 29th: The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government has made a decision on developing practical technical education for primary and secondary school students in order to educate young people to love labor.

The decision requires all primary and secondary schools across the country to gradually increase technical operation courses. This year, this course will first be added to 500 primary schools and 40 secondary schools. The purpose of this is to enable students to understand some basic knowledge about production and the laws of natural development from theory and practice, especially to make students aware of commonly used labor tools, machines, and raw materials.

The decision also requires factories, enterprises, state-owned farms, and agricultural producers' cooperatives to actively provide assistance.

    中小学增设技术操作课
  据新华社布达佩斯29日电匈牙利工农革命政府为教育青年热爱劳动，已经作出关于发展中小学生产技术实践教育的决议。
    决议要求全国各中小学逐渐增加技术操作课程。今年首先要在五百个小学和四十个中学里增加这门课程。这样作的目的在于使学生从理论和实践中了解一些有关生产的基本知识和自然发展规律，特别是要使学生们认识常用的劳动工具、机器和原料。
    决议还要求工厂企业、国营农场和农业生产合作社积极给予协助。
