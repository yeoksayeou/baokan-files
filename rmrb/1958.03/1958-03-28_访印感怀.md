Thoughts on Visiting India
Xiao Xiangrong

I accompanied the Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China on a visit to India and received a warm welcome from the Indian government, army, and people. I write this short poem to express my feelings and to record our friendship.

    On the Ajanta Caves
    Throngs of people echo to the Western Heavens,
    Carved cliffs and chiseled rocks for hundreds of years;
    Skilled hands carve emptiness and form,
    Exquisite craftsmanship sculpts the Buddha's face.
    How many people have come to admire it,
    Could it be from a past life's predestined fate?
    I am delighted to visit this famous place,
    And think of the friendship and remember the wise men of the past.

    On the Nangal Dam
    The great dam stands tall and majestic,
    Encompassing the clear waters of myriad valleys;
    Blessing millions of acres,
    Shining brightly over several states.
    Ten years of arduous construction,
    A hundred years of awe-inspiring spirit.
    I am pleased to see the new look,
    And wish great success from afar.

    On Ambala
    Air Force Demonstration
    Iron birds are even more like hawks soaring,
    Flying back and forth with ease.
    May I ask how they can be so light,
    The human world also has its own proud talents.
    Watching the "Dhanush" Exercise
    A quick sketch
    The warm breeze and bright sunshine herald the dawn,
    Host and guests gather happily on the stands.
    The sky birds spit out thunder and lightning,
    The iron oxen roar like raging storms;
    Thick smoke screens cover the ridges,
    Brave soldiers march forward with earth-shattering force.
    I am delighted at my friendly neighbor's great achievements,
    And happily share a toast for peace.

    Farewell to Indian Friends
    I ride the east wind as a guest once more,
    Friendship contends and a hundred flowers bloom.
    This trip is enough to fulfill a lifelong wish,
    And I return to my homeland full of springtime light.

　　Nineteen fifty-eight, two, twenty-seventh in New Delhi.

    访印感怀
    萧向荣
    随中华人民共和国军事友好访印代表团访问印度，受到印度政府、军队和人民的热情接待。赋小诗以述感怀，并志友谊。
    题“阿旃陀”石窟芸芸万众响西天，削壁锤岩数百年；巧手琢开空色相，纤工雕出佛容颜。从来几许人瞻仰，岂是前生有夙缘？且喜身临名胜地，遥思友谊忆先贤。
    题“南迦尔”水坝伟坝巍然立，包容万壑清；福荫千万亩，光耀几邦明。十载工程苦，百年心魄惊。欣看新面貌，遥祝大功成。
    题“安巴拉”空军表演铁鸟犹疑鹰隼飘，翩翻往复任逍遥。问渠那得轻如许，人间亦自有天骄。观“达努士”演习，速写风和日暖曙光开，主喜宾欢集看台。天鸟蛋如雷电闪，铁牛吼似暴风摧；浓烟幕幕重岗掩，壮士赳赳卷地来。喜我友邻成就大，和平欣与共干杯。
    留别印度诸友又乘东风作客来，友情争逐百花开。此行堪慰平生愿，满载春光故国回。
      一九五八，二，二十七于新德里。
