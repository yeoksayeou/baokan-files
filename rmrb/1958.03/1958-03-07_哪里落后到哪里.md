    Go to Where Things are Backward
    Gao Changren
    “The problem we have here is the uneven development of the movement. It’s because we have some backward townships and backward cooperatives here.” This is a commonly expressed opinion among some rural cadres.
    Imbalance is a general law of the movement of things. The responsibility of leadership lies in using the greatest effort to make the backward catch up with the advanced, and to make the advanced even more advanced. In this way, work can continuously develop and advance.
    Not long ago, a reporter interviewed in Yanghua Township, Liuyang County, Hunan Province, and the situation there can illustrate this issue.
    Yanghua Township has eighteen agricultural cooperatives, among which Sanyuan, Shandou, and Guanshan cooperatives have always been backward in various tasks, especially during the winter production upsurge and the rural rectification movement, they appeared even more imbalanced compared to the other fifteen cooperatives. While other cooperatives were enthusiastically discussing the Forty Articles on Agriculture and formulating this year's production plans, these three cooperatives were cold and quiet. With these three backward cooperatives, it would be difficult to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production for the entire township.
    How to solve this problem? People with different understandings have different approaches. Some cadres believe that backward cooperatives have many problems and are troublesome, and that no achievements can be made even if they go there. They always avoid backward cooperatives, avoiding them whenever possible. However, the leading cadres of Yanghua Township are not like this. Their approach is to go wherever things are backward. The township Party general branch carefully studied the reasons why these three cooperatives were backward and decided to send capable key cadres to the backward cooperatives to help them catch up with the advanced. After more than twenty days of hard work, the backward state of these three cooperatives rapidly changed. Guanshan cooperative developed collective sideline occupations, with daily income reaching more than 200 yuan; the task of eliminating pests and accumulating fertilizer was quickly completed. Weeds on the field ridges were also cleared. Shandou cooperative launched a high tide of water conservancy construction, the entire cooperative repaired more than 40 ponds, and is building a reservoir that can irrigate more than 400 mu of land.
    Because these three backward cooperatives caught up with the advanced cooperatives, the advanced cooperatives are creating conditions to strive for even greater advancement. Dashan cooperative in this township was originally an advanced unit, and originally planned to cultivate more than 400 mu of oil-tea camellia mountains last winter. When Dashan cooperative learned that Sanyuan cooperative had cultivated 300 mu of oil-tea camellia mountains, it mobilized its members to cultivate another 300 mu, striving to maintain its advanced status. All eighteen cooperatives in the township enthusiastically launched a socialist competition, and Yanghua Township has already leaped into an advanced township.
    "Go to Where Things are Backward" is not very easy to do for some staff who are used to sitting in offices and not contacting reality much. But this slogan must be emphasized. The reasons are: First, the production of backward areas and backward units is generally not well done, the improvement of people's lives is less, and even very poor. We have no reason to let them remain poor for a long time regarding the lives of the people. Second, doing a good job in backward units can more powerfully promote general units and advanced units, so they can quickly advance, because no one has a reason and will not want to let backward units surpass themselves. This will soon create a revolutionary competition situation where all horses gallop forward, making the entire work leap forward, changing with each passing day, and greatly accelerating the pace of the revolution. Therefore, "Go to Where Things are Backward" should be promoted as an important leadership method.

    哪里落后到哪里
    高长任
    “我们这里的问题，是运动发展不平衡。因为我们这里有几个落后乡、落后社。”这是某些农村干部经常谈论的意见。
    不平衡，是事物运动的一般规律。领导的责任就在于用最大的努力，使落后的赶上先进的，使先进的更加先进。这样，工作就能不断发展，不断前进。
    不久以前，记者在湖南省浏阳县杨花乡采访，那里的情况就可以说明这个问题。
    杨花乡有十八个农业社，其中三元、山斗、官山三个社在各项工作中一向落后，特别是在冬季生产高潮和农村整风运动中，和其他十五个社比较，显得更加不平衡。别的社热火朝天地讨论农业纲要四十条和制订今年的生产计划，这三个社却是冷冷清清。有了这三个落后社，全乡农业生产大跃进是很难实现了。
    怎样解决这个问题呢？认识不同的人有不同的做法。有些干部认为落后社问题多，麻烦大，去了也搞不出成绩。他们对落后社总是避而远之，能不去，就不去。但是，杨花乡的领导干部不是这样，他们的做法是哪里落后就到哪里去。乡党总支仔细研究了这三个社所以落后的原因，决定派能力强的主要干部到落后社去，帮助它们赶上先进。经过二十多天的艰苦工作，这三个社的落后状态迅速地转变了。官山社集体副业发展了，每天收入达二百多元；除虫积肥迅速完成了任务。田坎杂草也都铲光了。山斗社掀起了兴修水利的高潮，全社补修了四十多口水塘，又在兴建一口能灌四百多亩田的水库。
    由于这三个落后社赶上了先进社，先进社又在创造条件，争取更先进。这个乡的大山社原来是先进单位，去冬原计划垦复油茶山四百多亩。当大山社知道三元社垦复了三百亩油茶山之后，又发动社员再垦三百亩，争取保持先进。全乡十八个社轰轰烈烈地开展了社会主义竞赛，杨花乡已经一跃而为先进乡了。
    “哪里落后到哪里”，对于一些坐惯了办公室，不大接触实际的工作人员，并不是很容易做到的。但这口号必须强调。原因是：第一，落后地区和落后单位的生产一般都搞得不好，群众生活改善较少，甚至还很贫苦，对于人民的生活，我们没有理由听任他们长期贫苦下去。第二，把落后单位的工作搞好了，可以更有力地推动一般单位和先进单位，使他们赶快前进，因为谁都没有理由也不会愿意让落后单位赶过自己去。这样很快就会造成万马齐奔的革命竞赛形势，使整个工作飞跃前进，日新月异，大大加快革命的步伐。所以，“哪里落后到哪里”就应该当成一个重要的领导方法来提倡。
