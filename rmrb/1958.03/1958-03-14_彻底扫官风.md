Thoroughly Sweep Away Officialdom
This newspaper's correspondent in Tianjin

"Officer Liu" and "Officer Li"

During the rectification campaign before the Spring Festival, the Tianjin No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory resolved over 95% of the more than 2,600 suggestions made by workers. Leading cadres also humbly accepted criticism from the masses and improved their work style. The factory also formulated measures to overcome bureaucracy, such as leading cadres participating in labor for half a day each week and regularly receiving visiting workers. These measures were praised by the workers. However, many veteran workers added "we hope you can make it a regular practice" after their praise. Some workers still jokingly called leading cadres such as the deputy factory director and the Party branch secretary "Officer Liu" and "Officer Li" when they saw them.

This phenomenon caught the attention of Li Zhangshuan, the secretary of the General Party Branch. In the General Branch Committee meeting, they re-analyzed the more than 2,000 suggestions made by the masses. They found that whether it was criticism of leading cadres or opinions on production management and welfare, the root cause was the demand for leading cadres to eliminate officialdom and thoroughly change their leadership style. Therefore, they re-analyzed the several measures formulated during the rectification to improve the leadership style and found that leading cadres still retained a lot of official airs. For example, leading cadres participating in labor for half a day each week was a good measure. However, as leading cadres of the factory, they felt that the time spent in contact with labor was still too short to fully understand production and the thinking of the masses. The method of leading cadres regularly receiving the masses meant that workers had to seek out the leaders, rather than the leaders going to the workers. In the General Branch Committee meeting, Deputy Factory Director Liu Erdun recalled a night shift before the Spring Festival when he worked with the workers of the boiler team for eight hours. During that night, the workers made twenty-five suggestions to him. Fifteen of them were implemented that night after he and the veteran workers studied them. As a result, the coal consumption per 100 meters of cloth dyed that night was reduced from 22 kilograms to 19 kilograms. Liu Erdun's experience greatly inspired the committee members. They realized that leading cadres of factories and enterprises must keep up with the current situation of rapid development in production, thoroughly abandon official airs, put on work clothes, and work alongside workers in the workshops.

Appearing as Ordinary Laborers

On February 28th, leading cadres began to work in shifts. Although the leading cadres were all very determined, they also had concerns when they first started participating in labor. Cadres who were originally workers were worried that workers would not welcome them since they had not worked in shifts for a long time. Leading cadres who did not understand the technology were afraid that workers would not patiently teach them the technology. In particular, they were even more concerned when they thought about the past situations where workers were not very enthusiastic about them when they participated in physical labor. However, when they really put on work clothes and walked into the workshop to participate in labor, this concern was quickly dispelled. The workers warmly welcomed them. When they saw Deputy Factory Director Liu Erdun and the chairman of the trade union, who were originally workers, they still affectionately called them "Master." After the General Branch Secretary arrived at the workshop, the veteran workers guaranteed to teach him the basic operations within a week. The workers poured water for the leading cadres, constantly asked them if they were tired, and rushed to do heavy work. The workers' enthusiasm greatly moved the leading cadres and further encouraged their determination to work in shifts. They found that workers were not enthusiastic about them in the past when they participated in labor because they had not eliminated their official airs. Therefore, they paid attention to appearing as ordinary workers at all times and in all places. During labor, they rushed to do all kinds of heavy and miscellaneous work, and when they could not participate in labor or group activities, they also asked the section chief and group leader for leave.

In the beginning, individual leading cadres were very active in labor, but had very little contact with workers. Some leading cadres who worked in shifts were simply interested in learning technology and were willing to go to the bleaching workshop with good technical conditions. After the General Party Branch Committee discovered these situations, it promptly corrected them and emphasized that leading cadres must pay attention to contacting workers and making friends with workers when participating in labor. The deputy factory director, the general branch secretary and other leading cadres each made two friends. When the workers saw that the leading cadres had truly put down their airs and established a truly equal relationship with the workers, they loved and trusted the leaders even more. They said: "Now it is impossible to tell who is the factory director and who is the worker, everyone is the master of the factory." The workers' enthusiasm for labor further increased.

Working as a Worker to be a Good Factory Director

After the factory's leading cadres, especially Deputy Factory Director Liu Erdun, began working in shifts, the main problem they encountered was: on the one hand, they had to work in shifts, and on the other hand, and more importantly, how to lead production well. In order to solve this contradiction, the General Branch Committee initially put forward ten tasks to the leading cadres working in shifts, namely: "One expert (both red and expert), two helpers (helping group leaders and section chiefs), threeizations (cadre workerization, life massification, and regular labor), and four packages (packaging production, packaging political work, packaging central tasks, and packaging the promotion of advanced experience)." These ten tasks required them not only to be good workers, but more importantly, to be good leaders. After the leading cadres went down, they specifically solved two problems in Liu Erdun's leadership.

The first was what to do with the work of the offices? In the first few days after Deputy Factory Director Liu Erdun went down, the work of the offices was somewhat chaotic. Some work was left without anyone responsible, and the work was not well connected. The work of the factory director's office was also disorganized, and some official documents could not be processed in a timely manner. Liu Erdun was also uneasy about working in the workshop. Later, the factory leadership made timely adjustments to strengthen the sense of responsibility of the office staff. All work within the scope of the responsibilities of each office was handled by the office, and some major issues and economic indicators were reviewed by Liu Erdun. At the same time, specific arrangements were made for working hours to make the work of the offices more orderly and to further mobilize the enthusiasm of the office staff. Liu Erdun was also able to work in shifts with peace of mind and spend more time thinking about important issues. In this way, not only was the leadership of the work of the offices not weakened, but on the contrary, Liu Erdun was able to lead the work of the offices more specifically because he understood the reality of production. Once, when he was working in the workshop, the workers reported to him that there was only enough vulcanized blue for one day, so he immediately instructed the business finance department to prepare materials, and the problem was quickly solved.

Another problem that arose after Deputy Factory Director Liu Erdun worked in shifts was how to achieve collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility? Before working in shifts, the factory often held meetings, and some trivial matters were often discussed for a long time. After Liu Erdun and others worked in shifts, the factory greatly streamlined the meetings. After some major issues were studied in the General Branch Committee, they were resolved by the relevant people according to the spirit of division of labor and responsibility. In this way, collective leadership was not only not weakened, but was strengthened. Because the leading cadres were familiar with production knowledge, grasped accurate information, and listened to a large number of suggestions from the masses during their work in shifts, the time for leading cadres to collectively study problems was shortened, the quality was improved, and meetings and reports were greatly streamlined. Problems that could not be solved for a long time in the past were solved one by one.

With One Mind from Top to Bottom, Yellow Earth Turns into Gold

After a brotherly relationship formed between the leaders and workers, the workers actively sought ways to reduce the workload of the leading cadres. When worker Li Wenlin learned that the factory was preparing to install new machines and planned to dismantle the old pool used for making pulp, he secretly swung a heavy iron hammer weighing dozens of pounds after work to smash the old pool made of reinforced concrete. Workers who were off work saw this and immediately joined in. The men smashed the pool, and the women carried the rubble. The sound of hammers shook the ground, sparks flew, and they worked until late at night. In 1955, the factory spent 30,000 yuan to install a large flat washing machine, but because the machine did not meet the specifications, quality accidents often occurred. Last year, the factory director appointed a workshop director to lead the workers to repair it, but the director was afraid of getting his pants dirty, so he tore off a piece of waste cotton and sat on the machine, watching the workers work. As a result, the repair was intermittent for a long time, and the machine still could not be used. A few days ago, after Deputy Factory Director Liu Erdun went to the workshop to work, he asked the workers: "Can this machine still be used?" Veteran worker Liu Zhong said: "It can be used if you want to use it." In the process of repeatedly discussing and studying with the workers, they finally found a way to turn the weaknesses of the machine into advantages. The factory director proposed to refit the machine within half a month. The workers said: "Ten days!" The workers rushed to participate in voluntary labor for the refitting after work and on rest days. As a result, it was repaired in only six days. It is estimated that this machine can increase the factory's production by 12,000 meters of colored cloth per day and create a profit of 110,000 yuan for the country every year.

Since the factory implemented the system of leading cadres working in shifts, the daily output has increased by more than 1,000 meters from the past highest of more than 77,000 meters. Among the 62 workers with quality indicators in the factory, 57 to 61 people maintained a 100% rate of qualified products every day, which is a rare phenomenon in the printing and dyeing industry. On March 5, Zhao Xianzhang, the job planner, felt very strange about this phenomenon in the factory. He asked the General Branch Secretary: "Our factory has neither increased equipment nor invested in tangible measures, how can the daily output increase by more than 1,200 meters?" Veteran worker Ma Junlong said next to him: "With one mind from top to bottom, yellow earth turns into gold!"

    彻底扫官风
    本报驻天津记者
    “刘官”和“李官”
    天津市第二印染厂在春节前的整改中，已经把工人提出的二千六百多条意见解决了95％以上。领导干部也虚心地接受了群众的批评，作风也有了转变。工厂还制订出领导干部每周半天参加劳动、定期接见来访工人等克服官僚主义的措施。这些都受到工人们的赞扬。但是许多老工人在赞扬以后，还要加上“希望你们经常化”这句话，有些工人见了副厂长、党支部书记等领导干部，仍开玩笑似的叫他们“刘官”、“李官”。
    这种现象，引起了中共总支书记李章栓的注意。在总支委员会上，他们重新分析了群众提出的二千多条意见，发现不论是对领导干部的批评，还是对生产管理、生活福利方面的意见，追根究底都是要求领导干部打掉官气，彻底改变领导作风。于是，他们重新分析了整改中制订的几项改进领导作风的措施，发现领导干部还有很多官气。如领导干部每周参加半天劳动，是一个很好的措施。但是，作为工厂的领导干部，觉得接触劳动的时间还很少，不能更多地了解生产和群众思想。领导干部定期接待群众的办法，是叫工人找领导，而不是领导去找工人。在总支委员会上，副厂长刘二囤回忆起春节前的一天夜班，他曾跟锅炉班的工人一起劳动了八小时。在这一夜之间，工人们向他提出了二十五条建议。其中十五条经过他和老工人们的研究，当晚就实现，结果这一夜每染一百公尺布的煤耗，就由二十二公斤降低到十九公斤。刘二囤的体会，给委员们以很大的启发。他们认识到工厂企业的领导干部要跟上当前生产飞跃发展的形势，必须彻底放下官架子，穿上工作服，到车间里与工人一起跟班劳动。
    以普通劳动者出现
    2月28日，领导干部开始跟班劳动。虽然领导干部决心都很大，但是在开始参加劳动时，也有顾虑。原来是工人出身的干部担心很久不跟班劳动了，工人是否欢迎自己。不懂技术的领导干部则怕工人不能耐心地教技术。特别是他们想到过去参加体力劳动时，工人对他们不很热情的情况，就更增加了顾虑。但是，当他们真的穿起工作服，走进车间参加劳动以后，这个顾虑很快就消除了。工人们热情地欢迎他们，看到工人出身的副厂长刘二囤和工会主席时，仍亲切地叫他们“师傅”。总支书记到了车间以后，老工人们保证在一周内教会他基本操作。工人们给领导干部倒水，不断问他们累不累，并且抢着干重活。工人的这种热情，使领导干部非常感动，更加鼓舞了他们跟班劳动的决心。他们发现过去参加劳动，工人对他们不热情，是因为他们的官气没有打掉。于是他们随时随地注意以普通工人的姿态出现。在劳动时他们抢着干各种重活和杂活，不能参加劳动或小组活动的时候，也向工段长、小组长请假。
    开始的时候，个别领导干部劳动很积极，但是和工人的接触很少，也有个别跟班劳动的干部单纯为了学习技术，都愿到技术条件好的漂炼车间。党总支委员会发现这些情况以后，便及时地加以纠正，并强调指出，领导干部参加跟班劳动，必须注意接触工人，同工人交朋友。副厂长、总支书记等每个人都交了两个朋友。工人们看到领导干部真正放下架子，和工人建立了真正平等关系，更加爱戴和信任领导。他们说：“现在已经分不出谁是厂长，谁是工人了，大家都是工厂的主人”。工人们的劳动热情进一步高涨起来。
    当工人是为了当好厂长
    工厂领导干部特别是副厂长刘二囤跟班劳动以后，碰到的主要问题是：一方面要跟班劳动，另一方面也是主要的是如何领导好生产。为了解决这个矛盾，总支委员会一开始就向跟班劳动的领导干部提出了十条任务，即：“一专（又红又专）二帮（帮助小组长、工段长）三化（干部工人化、生活群众化、劳动经常化）四包（包生产、包政治工作、包中心任务、包推广先进经验）”。这十条任务要求他们不仅要当好工人，重要的是当好领导。在领导干部下去以后，又具体解决了副厂长刘二囤领导中的两个问题。
    首先是科室工作怎么办？副厂长刘二囤下去的头几天，科室工作一度有些混乱。有些工作无人负责，工作衔接得不够好。厂长办公室的工作也没有头绪，一些公文不能及时处理。刘二囤在车间劳动，也安不下心来。后来，工厂领导方面及时作了调整，加强了科室人员的责任心。凡属于各科室职责范围内的工作，由科室负责解决，一些重大问题和各项经济指标，通过刘二囤审核。同时又在工作时间上做了具体安排，使科室工作更有秩序，科室人员的积极性更加发挥。刘二囤也能安心跟班劳动，并且用较多的时间考虑重大的问题。这样，不仅没有削弱对科室工作的领导，相反，由于刘二囤了解生产实际，就能够更具体地领导科室工作。一次他在车间劳动，工人向他反映硫化蓝只够一天用，他便马上指示经营财务股备料，很快就解决了问题。
    副厂长刘二囤跟班生产以后出现的另一个问题是如何实现集体领导和分工负责？在跟班劳动以前，厂里经常开会，有些琐碎的小事，也常常商量很久。刘二囤等跟班劳动以后，工厂大大地精简了会议。一些重大问题在总支委员会上研究后，就根据分工负责的精神由有关的人去解决。这样，集体领导不仅没有削弱，反而更加强了。由于领导干部在跟班劳动中熟悉了生产知识，掌握了确切的情况，并听取了群众大量的建议，因此领导干部集体研究问题的时间缩短了，质量提高了，会议和表报也大大地精简了。过去长期不能解决的问题，都一一地得到解决。
    上下一条心，黄土变成金
    领导和工人亲如兄弟的关系形成以后，工人们都积极设法减轻领导干部的工作负担。工人李文林知道工厂准备安装新机器，打算把原来做纸浆的池子拆掉的时候，下班后就偷偷地抡起几十斤重的大铁锤，要把这个钢筋水泥的旧池子砸碎。下班的工人看见了，立即参加。男的砸池子，女的抬碎石，锤声动地，火星四溅，一直干到深夜。1955年这个厂花三万元安置一台大平洗机，因为机器不合规格，常出质量事故。去年厂长指定一个车间主任领导工人去修理，这位主任怕机器弄脏裤子，就撕了块轴头布垫着坐在机器上，看着工人干活。因此断续地修理很长时间，机器仍旧不能使用。日前副厂长刘二囤下车间劳动以后，问工人：“这台机器还能用吗？”老工人刘忠说：“你要用就能用。”在和工人们一起反复商量、研究的过程中，终于找出把这台机器的弱点变为优点的办法。厂长提出在半月内把这台机器改装好。工人们说：“十天！”工人们在下班后和休息天争先恐后地参加改装的义务劳动。结果仅仅六天就修理好。预计这台机器每天可以为工厂增产一万二千公尺色布，每年将为国家创造十一万元的利润。
    这个工厂自实行领导干部跟班劳动制以后，日产量又由过去最高的七万七千多公尺增加了一千多公尺。全厂六十二个有质量指标的工人中，每天有五十七到六十一人保持了百分之百的正品率，这是印染行业中罕有的现象。3月5日，作业计划员赵宪章对工厂出现的这种现象感到非常奇怪。他问总支书记：“咱们工厂既没有增加设备，又没有投入有形的措施，怎么日产量就会增加一千二百多公尺呢？”老工人马俊龙在旁边说：“上下一条心，黄土变成金！”
