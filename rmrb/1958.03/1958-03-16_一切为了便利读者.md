    Everything for the Convenience of Readers
    Today, this newspaper published news of a proposal by outstanding newspaper distribution workers to distribution personnel nationwide. Their proposal calls on distribution personnel across the country, in accordance with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, to demonstrate revolutionary vigor surpassing the advanced, boldly break conventions, and exhaust all means to facilitate readers. This is a major event in newspaper distribution work and concerns the interests of millions of readers.
    Socialist newspapers and periodicals are among the best tools to help cadres and the masses learn about current events and policies, study culture and theory, and exchange work experience. In the new situation of the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, a great leap forward in newspaper distribution will play a significant role in inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses and promoting the continuous upsurge of the production high tide.
    The existing achievements in newspaper distribution work are significant. Especially after the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, the distribution of newspapers and periodicals to rural areas has become a resounding slogan in distribution work. Currently, there is a professional and non-professional distribution force of 300,000 people nationwide. The number of newspapers distributed has increased from 3.4 million in 1951 to over 15 million currently; magazines have increased from over 900,000 to over 17 million. The variety of publications distributed has also increased from dozens in the past to over 2,900. Comparing the number of newspapers distributed with the national population, there was one newspaper for every 274 people in 1950, and one for every 40 people in 1957. The achievements of distribution work are not only reflected in the rapid increase in quantity and the increasing variety of publications, but also in the improvement of work quality. In the past, areas that could only see the day's newspaper after two or three days, now, thanks to the active efforts of distribution personnel, adjusted routes, and shortened the circulation process, can see the newspaper the next day or even in the afternoon of the same day. The distribution staff of the Shanghai Post Office have already achieved the goal of processing and delivering newspapers within five minutes of arrival. Retail sales have also increased significantly. Many rural areas across the country not only have newspapers in every cooperative, but also in every team, and every day. This is a glorious page in the history of newspaper distribution work in our country.
    However, compared with the needs of the people nationwide, the existing work achievements are still far from sufficient. Our country has a large population and vast territory. With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, more readers not only need to learn about the Party's principles and policies, the vigorous atmosphere of socialist construction, and the rapidly changing production achievements from newspapers and periodicals in a timely manner, but also need to find advanced experiences and advanced indicators from the newspapers so as to refresh records and create even more amazing achievements in the socialist competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. This situation urgently requires newspaper distribution work to exhaust all means to increase the number of copies distributed and shorten the circulation process, in order to fully meet the needs of readers.
    To fully meet the needs of readers, the fundamental issue lies in whether the distribution personnel have a sufficient mass perspective and whether they start from facilitating readers. In fact, many distribution workers and postal workers have a high degree of mass perspective. In order to deliver newspapers and periodicals to readers in a timely manner, regardless of the hot summer or cold winter, they often work before dawn and after dusk, braving wind and rain. Some sacrifice their holidays and rest time to actively carry out retail business; others have to travel dozens of miles in the evening to deliver newspapers to rural areas; some are even more diligent in visiting and asking, collecting newspaper and magazine subscriptions door-to-door. Their spirit of hard work and overcoming difficulties has been supported and loved by the vast number of readers. Zhang Wenhua, a newspaper retailer at the Shijiazhuang Post and Telecommunications Bureau, has been praised by the masses thirty-six times in a row because she has come up with many ways to facilitate readers. People praise her as a "good servant of the people." The distribution personnel in Yueyang County, Hunan Province, have a clear view of serving the peasants and have thought of many ways to meet the readers' requirements. Last year, there was an average of one newspaper or periodical for every fourteen people in the rural areas of this county. This year, they will strive to achieve an average of one copy for every nine people. This active spirit is worthy of praise.
    In order to facilitate the masses, it may bring some trouble and difficulties to oneself. However, all progressive revolutionary undertakings will always have such troubles or difficulties, and there are very few things without trouble and difficulty. Those who are determined to serve the broad masses will surely bravely undertake the most arduous tasks. Because the trouble of a few people eliminates the trouble of the majority. Therefore, the trouble and difficulties encountered in serving millions of people is the glorious responsibility of every distribution worker. Facts have proved that those who are not afraid of trouble and difficulties have higher distribution volumes and the masses are also satisfied. This is a matter of mass perspective. The strength of the mass perspective is the yardstick for measuring the quality of distribution work. Distribution workers should often use this yardstick to measure their work and supervise their actions.
    In order to facilitate the masses, it is necessary to resolutely abolish all outdated rules and customs. All outdated rules and customs are obstacles to connecting with the masses and obstacles to distribution work. At present, some newspaper subscription systems and procedures do not start from facilitating readers. For example, subscribing to newspapers at the post office and paying at the end of the month brings many restrictions to readers. Some readers are not well-off at the end of the month after paying their expenses, and often cannot subscribe to the newspaper as a result. Other regulations regarding subscribing mid-month, transmitting orders, start dates, as well as attendance systems and requiring introduction letters to subscribe to newspapers, also have many aspects that are worth improving. Many rules and regulations are formulated based on the experiences and lessons learned in the past, using specific times and specific conditions as the basis. However, when times and conditions change, the system and regulations must be changed accordingly. Otherwise, it will become an obstacle to continued progress. The current situation is that a large number of cadres are going to the mountains and the countryside; institutions are streamlined, and there is more mobility of staff. In this case, it is necessary to make newspaper subscriptions convenient, payment convenient, early start dates, early viewing of newspapers, no mistakes, no omissions, and more retail sales in order to meet objective needs. In the current movement against waste and conservatism, we hope that the staff of the postal distribution system will break down outdated rules and regulations and boldly innovate, which will be of great benefit to improving distribution work and facilitating readers.
    Of course, it must also be seen that doing a good job in distribution is related to the quality of the newspapers and periodicals themselves. At present, newspapers and periodicals across the country are intensifying their efforts to improve layout, enrich content, lower prices, and ensure publication times. This provides favorable conditions for a great leap forward in distribution work.
    The enthusiasm of the advanced distribution workers in their proposal to actively improve newspaper and periodical distribution work is very valuable. It is hoped that the departments concerned will cherish this enthusiasm, mobilize the broad masses of distribution personnel, respond to their proposal, and launch appraisal competitions to create a new situation in newspaper and periodical distribution work in our country.

### 一切为了便利读者

    一切为了便利读者
    今天本报发表了优秀报刊发行工作者向全国发行工作人员提出倡议书的消息，他们倡议全国发行工作人员，根据多快好省的方针，拿出比先进赶先进的革命干劲，大胆地打破常规，想尽一切办法，方便读者。这是报刊发行工作上的一件大事，也是关系千百万读者利益的事情。
    社会主义的报刊是帮助干部和群众学习时事政策，学习文化和理论，交流工作经验的最好工具之一。在全国工农业生产大跃进的新形势下，报刊发行工作也来一个大跃进，这对鼓舞广大人民群众的革命干劲，推动生产高潮的不断高涨，将会起重大的作用。
    报刊发行工作已有的成绩是显著的。特别是农业合作化高潮出现以后，把报刊发行到农村去，已经成为发行工作的一个响亮口号了。现在全国已经有一支由三十万人组成的专业和非专业的发行队伍。报纸发行的份数，也由1951年的三百四十万份增长到目前的一千五百多万份；杂志由九十多万份增长到一千七百多万份。发行的品种，也由过去的几十种增加到二千九百多种。拿报纸发行份数和全国人口作比较，1950年每二百七十四人才有一份报纸，1957年每四十个人就有一份。发行工作的成绩不仅表现在数量的迅速增长和品种的日益增多，而且工作质量也有所提高。过去两三天以后才能看到当天报纸的地区，由于发行工作人员的积极努力，调整了线路，缩短了流转过程，现在隔天或者当天下午就可以看到报纸。上海邮局的发行工作人员，已经做到了报纸进门五分钟就出班送报。零售的数量也大大增加了。全国许多农村不仅是社社有报，而且队队有报，日日有报。这是我国报刊发行工作上光辉的一页。
    但是，现有的工作成就和全国人民的需要比较起来，还有很大的距离。我国人口众多，地区辽阔，随着工农业生产的迅速发展，有更多的读者，不仅需要及时地从报刊上了解党的方针政策，了解蓬蓬勃勃的社会主义建设气象和日新月异的生产成就，而且还要从报纸上寻找先进经验、先进指标，以便在比先进、学先进、赶先进的社会主义竞赛中，刷新纪录，创造出更为惊人的成就。这种形势迫切要求报刊发行工作应该想尽一切办法，增加发行数量，缩短流转过程，以便充分满足读者的需要。
    要充分满足读者的需要，根本问题是在于发行人员有没有充分的群众观点，是不是从便利读者出发。事实上，很多发行工作人员和邮递员是具有高度的群众观点的，他们为了及时地把报刊送到读者手里，不问炎夏或寒冬，常常披星戴月，风里来，雨里去。有的牺牲了假日和休息时间，积极开展零售业务；有的在傍晚还得赶几十里路程，把报纸送往农村去；有的更加勤跑勤问，上门收订报刊。他们这种不辞劳苦、克服困难的精神，受到了广大读者的拥护和爱戴。石家庄邮电局报刊零售员张文华，由于她想出了许多办法便利读者，接连受到了群众三十六次的表扬。人们称赞她是“人民的好勤务员”。湖南岳阳县的发行人员有明确的为农民服务的观点，想了许多办法满足读者的要求。去年这个县的农村里平均每十四个人有一份报刊。今年，他们要争取做到平均每九个人有一份。这种积极的精神是值得表扬的。
    为了便利群众，也许会给自己带来一些麻烦和困难。然而，一切前进的革命事业，总是会有这样或那样麻烦的，没有麻烦和困难的事是极少的。坚定地为广大群众服务的人，一定会勇敢地承担起最艰巨的任务。因为有了少数人的麻烦，就免除了多数人的麻烦。所以为千百万人服务所遇到的麻烦和困难，乃是每个发行人员光荣的职责。事实证明，凡是不怕麻烦不怕困难的人，他们的发行数量也高，群众也表示满意。这是群众观点问题。群众观点的强弱，是测量发行工作好坏的尺子，发行工作人员应当经常用这把尺子，来衡量自己的工作，监督自己的行动。
    为了便利群众，必须坚决地废除一切陈规陋习。一切陈规陋习，是联系群众的障碍，是发行工作的障碍。目前，有一些订报制度和手续，不是从便利读者出发的。例如到邮局订报，月底收费，给读者带来了很多限制。有些读者，一个月开支下来，手头并不宽裕，往往因此订不上报。其他在破月订报、定单传送、起报时间以及出班制度、开介绍信订报等规定，也有许多值得改进的地方。许多规章制度，是总结了过去的经验教训，以一定的时间和特定条件作为依据制定出来的。但是，当时间和条件发生变化的时候，制度和规定就得作相应的变更。否则，就会成为继续前进的阻碍。目前的情况是大批干部上山下乡；机构精简，机关人员流动较多。在这种情况下，必须做到订报方便，交款方便，早起报，早见报，没差错，没遗漏，多零售，才能适应客观的需要。在目前反浪费反保守运动中，我们希望邮政发行系统的职工，破除清规戒律，大胆革新，这对改进发行工作，便利读者，将会有很大的好处。
    当然，也必须看到，要做好发行工作，同报刊本身的质量是有关系的。目前，全国各报刊正在为改进版面，充实内容，降低售价，保证出版时间等方面加紧努力。这就为发行工作的大跃进提供了有利的条件。
    先进发行工作者的倡议书中，积极要求改进报刊发行工作的热情是很可贵的。希望各有关部门，爱护这种热情，动员广大发行人员，响应他们的倡议，开展评比竞赛，使我国的报刊发行工作出现一个新的局面。
