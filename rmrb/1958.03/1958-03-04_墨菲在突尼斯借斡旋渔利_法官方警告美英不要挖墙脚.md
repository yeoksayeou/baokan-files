Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: After arriving in Tunisia from Paris on February 25th, U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of State Murphy, who was appointed by the U.S. government as a "mediator" in the French-Tunisian dispute, has held a series of negotiations with Tunisian authorities and the British Ambassador to Tunisia in recent days. Tunisian President Bourguiba emphasized the importance of resolving the Algerian issue.

According to a dispatch from Washington by the Associated Press, the United States is currently urging France and Tunisia to make some concessions on the terms of negotiation put forward by both sides, so as not to allow the "mediation" mission of the United States and Britain to fail.

Sources say that the United States and Britain intend to "comprehensively resolve the North African issue, including Algeria" in this "mediation," in order to establish a North African federation composed of Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco under the aegis of the United States and Britain, and to make this federation join the North Atlantic group.

Prior to this, the French government had made it clear more than once that it opposed its "allies" taking the opportunity to intervene in North Africa.

In recent days, the Paris stock market has continued to decline. In particular, the stocks of Sahara Petroleum Company and Algerian mines have fallen even more sharply.

    墨菲在突尼斯借斡旋渔利
    法官方警告美英不要挖墙脚
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：被美国政府委派为法国—突尼斯纠纷“斡旋人”的美国副国务卿帮办墨菲在2月25日由巴黎飞抵突尼斯后，连日同突尼斯当局和英国驻突尼斯大使进行了一系列的谈判。突尼斯总统布尔吉巴强调解决阿尔及利亚问题的重要性。
    据美联社从华盛顿发出的一条电讯说，美国目前正在敦促法突两国在双方所提出的谈判条件上都作出某些让步，以免使美英的“斡旋”使命遭到失败。
  有消息说，美英两国打算在这次“斡旋”中来“全面解决包括阿尔及利亚在内的北非问题”，以便建立一个在美英卵翼下的由突尼斯、阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥组成的北非联邦，并且使这个联邦加入北大西洋集团。
    在这以前，法国政府曾经不止一次地明白表示它对“盟国”乘机插足北非的反对态度。
    连日来，巴黎股票市场的行情不断下跌。特别是撒哈拉石油公司和阿尔及利亚矿山的股票下跌得更加猛烈。
