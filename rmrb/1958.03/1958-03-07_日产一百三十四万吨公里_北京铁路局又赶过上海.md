Daily Output of 1.34 Million Ton-Kilometers
Beijing Railway Bureau Surpasses Shanghai Again

(Our dispatch) After the Beijing Railway Administration proposed a competition to all railway administrations nationwide on February 12th to launch a daily million ton-kilometer campaign, many railway bureaus have already responded to the challenge. The Shanghai Railway Administration created a national record of an average daily output of 1,289,000 ton-kilometers per locomotive on March 4th, and proactively sent a telegram to the Beijing Bureau to introduce their experience.

After hearing this news, the employees of the Beijing Bureau were greatly encouraged. The Beijing Bureau Party Committee immediately took emergency measures, strengthened the organization and command of transportation work, organized employees to study the advanced experience of the Shanghai Bureau, and worked hard to increase daily output. After hard work, the Beijing Bureau broke the national record on March 6th, completing an average daily output of 1,340,000 ton-kilometers per locomotive, surpassing the Shanghai Bureau and ranking first in the country. The Shijiazhuang Dispatching Zone jumped from a previous high of 1,050,000 ton-kilometers to 1,280,000 ton-kilometers.

    日产一百三十四万吨公里
    北京铁路局又赶过上海
    本报讯　北京铁路管理局在2月12日向全国各铁路管理局提出开展日产百万吨公里运动竞赛的倡议以后，许多铁路局已经应战。上海铁路管理局在3月4日创造了平均每台机车日产一百二十八万九千吨公里的全国最高纪录，并且主动打电报给北京局，介绍了他们的经验。
    北京局职工听到这个消息以后，受到很大鼓舞。北京局党委立即采取了紧急措施，加强运输组织指挥工作，组织职工学习上海局的先进经验，努力提高日产量。经过苦战，北京局在3月6日突破了全国最高纪录，完成每台机车平均日产一百三十四万吨公里，超过上海局，跃居全国第一。石家庄调度分区由过去最高的日产一百零五万吨公里，一跃而达到一百二十八万吨公里。
