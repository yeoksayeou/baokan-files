Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch from Kuala Lumpur: According to a TASS dispatch from Kuala Lumpur, the head of the Soviet delegation, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Firyubin, stated on March 6th, while speaking about the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East's report on the region's economic situation, that he deeply regretted that the representatives of the People's Republic of China have not yet been able to enter the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. He said that those who occupy China's seat in the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East cannot represent China, and only representatives appointed by the government of the People's Republic of China are China's only legitimate representatives. In this regard, he pointed out the unsightly attempts to create a "two Chinas" situation. He said that this attempt is doomed to failure.

Firyubin said that the Soviet delegation believes that the participation of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Mongolian People's Republic in the work of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East would have a positive significance for cooperation among countries in the region of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. In addition, the accession of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to this commission would also help to bring the North and South of Korea and Vietnam closer together, which the people of these countries are extremely concerned about.

Firyubin discussed the economic situation of various countries in the Asian and Far Eastern region. He said that countries such as India, Burma, Ceylon, Indonesia, and Afghanistan, which pursue a policy of not participating in military blocs and active neutrality, are moving along the path of establishing independent national economies and have achieved certain achievements in economic development. At the same time, countries participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact military blocs are suffering severe economic difficulties due to huge military expenditures, which of course hinders their economic development.

He also explained the economic development of the Soviet Union, narrated the achievements of the Soviet Socialist Republics of Central Asia, and, on behalf of the governments of the Uzbek, Tajik, and Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republics, invited representatives of the countries belonging to the commission to visit the aforementioned republics in the second half of 1958 or 1959.

Firyubin also spoke about the economic achievements made by the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Mongolian People's Republic.

Firyubin said that the Soviet Union's consistent proposition of economic and scientific and technological cooperation between countries is a solid foundation for the peaceful coexistence of countries with different socio-economic systems.

The Soviet delegation suggested that the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East formulate basic principles for the economic relations of the commission's member states. Firyubin said that these principles could be expressed in the form of a declaration, which should include the following points: 1. Economic exchanges between developed and underdeveloped countries should be equal and mutually beneficial; 2. Establish foreign exchange relations that help the national economic development of underdeveloped countries; 3. Develop trade between all countries with different social and economic systems, and allow no discrimination or restrictions; 4. Develop each country's natural resources for the benefit of its own people; 5. Foreign investment and loans should not be subject to political or other conditions that would harm the sovereignty of the debtor country. He said that accepting the above declaration is in line with the United Nations General Assembly's twelfth session resolution on peaceful coexistence among nations and embodies the spirit of the Bandung Conference.

The Soviet delegation also suggested establishing an association of mineral resources experts of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, composed of thirty to forty people, to help Asian countries explore mineral deposits.

    苏联代表在亚洲及远东经委会指出
    制造“两个中国”的阴谋必败
    认为应有中朝越蒙代表参加会议
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社吉隆坡消息：苏联代表团团长、苏联外交部副部长费留宾，3月6日就联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会的关于这一地区经济状况的报告书发言时，对中华人民共和国代表直到现在还不能进入亚洲及远东经济委员会这件事深表遗憾。他说，在亚洲及远东经济委员会占据中国席位的人并不能代表中国，只有中华人民共和国政府委派的代表才是中国唯一合法的代表。在这方面，他指出了打算制造“两个中国”的局面的不体面的企图。他说，这种企图注定要失败。
    费留宾说，苏联代表团认为，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和蒙古人民共和国的代表参加亚洲及远东经济委员会的工作对亚洲及远东经济委员会地区各国的合作会有积极的意义。此外，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国加入这个委员会还有助于朝鲜、越南南北两部分的接近，这些国家的人民对这件事是极为关心的。
    费留宾论述了亚洲及远东地区各国的经济情况。他说，奉行不参加军事集团和积极中立的政策的印度、缅甸、锡兰、印度尼西亚、阿富汗等国，沿着建立独立的民族经济的道路前进，在经济发展方面取得了一定的成就。同时，参加东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约军事集团的国家却由于庞大的军事开支而遭受着严重的经济困难，这当然妨碍它们的经济发展。
    他也说明苏联的经济发展，叙述了中亚细亚各苏维埃社会主义共和国的成就，并且代表乌兹别克、塔吉克和土库曼苏维埃社会主义共和国政府邀请委员会所属国家的代表于1958年下半年或1959年访问上述各共和国。
    费留宾还谈论了中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和蒙古人民共和国所取得的经济成就。
    费留宾说，苏联提出的各国之间在经济和科学技术进行合作的一贯主张，是社会经济制度不同的国家和平共处的牢靠基础。
    苏联代表团建议，联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会制定出委员会成员国经济关系方面的基本原则。费留宾说，这些原则可以用宣言的形式表达出来，其中应该包括如下几点：一、发达和不发达国家之间的经济交流要平等互利；二、建立有助于不发达国家的民族经济发展的外汇关系；三、发展所有社会和经济制度不同的国家之间的贸易，不容许有任何歧视和限制；四、开发每个国家的天然资源以为本国人民造福；五、外国的投资和贷款不应带有损害债务国主权的政治条件或其他的条件。他说，接受上述宣言符合联合国大会第十二届会议关于各国和平共处的决议，并且体现万隆会议决议的精神。
    苏联代表团还建议建立一个由三十到四十人组成的联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会矿物资源专家协会，来帮助亚洲国家勘探矿藏。
