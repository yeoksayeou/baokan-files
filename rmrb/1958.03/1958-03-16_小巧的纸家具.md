    Small Paper Furniture
    A piece of old cardboard, a pair of scissors; plus a pencil and a ruler, and in a very short time you can cut out a set of new furniture.
    Fold a circular piece of white paper into quarters, cut four equally sized notches, and then paste the cut-out paper pattern onto the cardboard and cut it out to make the round tabletop of a low coffee table. The legs of the coffee table are also made by folding two pieces of cardboard in half and cutting them out, with different sized notches on the top and bottom. Finally, the three parts are slotted together along the dotted lines to form the table.
    The chair is divided into four parts: one backrest (two notches), two front and rear legs (each with three notches and one tenon), one chair surface (six notches), and one large connecting board (two notches). If you have drawn the paper pattern in advance on white paper, and then pasted it onto the cardboard, the intersections of the notches and tenons will be very accurate.
    This toy is easy to make, so parents can add a set of inexpensive, exquisite, and fun furniture for their children. (Lan Nao) (Attached image)

    小巧的纸家具
    一张旧的马粪纸、一把剪刀；再加上铅笔、直线尺，在极短的时间内，可以剪制好一套新型家具。
    把圆形的白纸折叠成四等分，剪四个同样大小的缺口，再把剪好的纸样贴在马粪纸上剪出来，便成为矮茶几的圆桌面。茶几的脚也是用两块马粪纸对折后剪好，分成上下两种不同的缺口做成。最后把三个部件依虚线卡在一起便成。
    椅子分为四个部件：一块靠背（两个缺口），两块前后腿（每块各有三个缺口，一个突榫），一块椅子面（六个缺口），一块大旺板（二个缺口）。要是事先在白纸上绘好了纸样，再贴到马粪纸上去，缺口与缺口，缺口与突榫的交接就会很准确了。
    这玩具制作容易，家长们为孩子们增添一套不费钱而又精致好玩的家具吧。　（蓝瑙） （附图片）
