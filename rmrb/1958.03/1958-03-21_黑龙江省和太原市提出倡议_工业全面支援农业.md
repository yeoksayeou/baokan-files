Heilongjiang Province and Taiyuan City Propose Initiative
Comprehensive Industrial Support for Agriculture

(Reported by our newspaper) At the recent Industrial Production Coordination Conference in Heilongjiang Province, 65 enterprises including the state-owned Harbin Cement Plant, the local state-owned Songjiang Machinery Factory, the joint state-private Jiamausi Xinlian Machinery Factory, and the Qiqihar Handicraft Cooperative proposed a six-point initiative to all industrial and mining enterprises in the province:

	One, every industrial and mining enterprise, wherever possible, should establish a mutual support relationship with one or more agricultural cooperatives, helping with one or more tasks.

	Two, any idle equipment within industrial and mining enterprises that is suitable for the needs of agricultural cooperatives should be sold to agricultural cooperatives at a discounted price, and some can even be given to agricultural cooperatives for free.

	Three, industrial and mining enterprises should vigorously support agricultural cooperatives technically in the installation and repair of power and machinery, charging costs in principle, and be responsible for imparting technology, assisting in the research and design of agricultural machinery and equipment, and training technicians in machinery, power, and other fields.

	Four, mobilize the transport capacity and employees and their families of the enterprise that can be supported, use spare time, or organize voluntary labor to support agricultural cooperatives.

	Five, mobilize the medical staff of industrial and mining enterprises to organize mobile medical teams to go to the countryside regularly for medical rounds, publicize health knowledge, and welcome members of agricultural cooperatives and their families to seek medical treatment at the clinics of industrial and mining enterprises in case of emergency. Fees can be reduced for members of agricultural cooperatives and their families who are indeed in financial difficulty.

	Six, strengthen the connection between industrial and mining enterprises and agricultural cooperatives in political and cultural life, assist agricultural cooperatives in establishing cultural and living facilities, invite members of agricultural cooperatives to participate in cultural life in industrial and mining enterprises regularly, and hold worker-peasant get-togethers during grand festivals such as the Spring Festival and National Day, visiting each other.

(Reported by our newspaper) On March 12, Taiyuan City held a coordination meeting for industrial support for agriculture. Leaders from 137 units, including state-owned, local state-owned industry, construction, finance and trade, public utilities, and culture and education, participated in the meeting.

Attendees expressed their willingness to vigorously support agriculture. Within a few hours, the units initially proposed to support more than 900 pieces of power equipment and thousands of other agricultural machinery and various tools. Many units have included projects for the production of agricultural machinery in their production plans. The Mining Machinery Factory has formed a special workshop to support agriculture; Jinxi Machinery Factory and Taiyuan Iron Factory are preparing to produce tractors of different specifications. Taiyuan No. 1 Construction Engineering Company expressed its willingness to provide manpower and technical support in the design of small rural reservoirs, electromechanical installation, and the installation of water lifting equipment.

The meeting also determined the division of labor for establishing regular contacts between factories and mines and rural areas, and the cooperative form of establishing "satellite factories" for various industries of the same type. (With picture)

Liaoning No. 2 Machinery Factory and Dazhong Electric Motor Factory jointly produced an electric tractor. This tractor uses the electricity generated by a wind turbine as a power source, and it can be used for farming as long as there is wind blowing in the countryside.

    黑龙江省和太原市提出倡议
    工业全面支援农业
    本报讯　在不久前召开的黑龙江省工业生产协作会议上，国营哈尔滨水泥厂、地方国营松江机械厂、公私合营佳木斯新联机械厂，以及齐齐哈尔手工业社等六十五个企业单位，向全省所有的工矿企业提出了六点倡议：
    一、每一个工矿企业，凡是有可能的都要和一个或几个农业社建立互相支援关系，帮助作一项或几项工作。
    二、凡工矿企业内有适合于农业社需要的呆滞设备，尽量折价售给农业社，有的还可以无偿地赠送给农业社利用。
    三、各工矿企业要大力从技术上支援农业社安装和修理动力、机械，原则上应按成本收费，并负责传授技术，协助研究设计农业机械设备，培养有关机械、动力等方面的技术工人。
    四、动员本企业可以支援的运输力量和职工及其家属，利用业余时间，或组织义务劳动，来支援农业社。
    五、发动工矿企业的医务人员，定期组织医疗队下乡巡回医疗，宣传卫生知识，并欢迎农业社社员及其家属遇有急病时，来工矿企业的医务所就诊。农业社社员及其家属如确属生活困难时，可以减少收费。
    六、加强工矿企业和农业社在政治文化生活方面的联系，协助农业社建立文化生活设施，邀请农业社社员经常到工矿企业参加文化生活，并在春节、国庆节等盛大节日举行工农联欢，互相访问。
    本报讯　3月12日，太原市召开了工业支援农业的协作会议。全市国营、地方国营工业、建筑、财贸、公用事业、文教等一百三十七个单位的负责人参加了会议。
    到会人员纷纷表示要大力支援农业。几小时之内，各单位即初步提出支援动力设备九百余件，支援其它农业机械、各种工具达数千件之多。很多单位在自己的生产计划中，都排进了生产农业机器的项目。矿山机器厂为了支援农业，专门组成一个车间；晋西机器厂和太原铁工厂都准备生产规格不同的拖拉机。太原市第一建筑工程公司表示要在农村小型水库设计、机电安装、提水设备安装等方面，给予人力及技术上的支援。
    会上还确定了各厂矿和各地农村建立经常联系的分工及各同类型工业建立“卫星厂”的协作形式。（附图片）
