Fuxin Dispatch: The "experimental plot" of the Fuxin Central Machine Repair Factory has achieved a bumper harvest. An unprecedented atmosphere of unity has emerged in the factory, and the workers' enthusiasm for production has erupted like a volcano, increasing the efficiency of some major products by four to five times.

Successfully passed the entrance exam and obtained the qualifications of an ordinary worker.

The vast majority of leading cadres in this factory are from worker backgrounds. When participating in production labor, personal technical specialties are generally taken into consideration; however, the factory's main leading cadres are assigned work based on the requirements of grasping key links and weak links. As soon as they arrive at the workshop, they sign apprenticeship contracts with workers and technical personnel to learn practical operating experience from the workers and technical theory from the technical personnel, with regular examinations. Each factory-level cadre participates in labor for sixteen hours a week. By participating in night shift labor, the situation where factory-level cadres and second and third-shift workers could not meet was changed. When they are working, they appear as ordinary workers, abide by the labor discipline of the team, and each time they participate in labor, the team leader makes an assessment and fills in a labor card as material for inspection and evaluation.

The hard work and diligent study of the leading cadres in the workshops have had a good influence on the workers. Zhang Hongxue, the Party Secretary, came to the steelmaking furnace and swept the floor, carried materials, and removed slag with the workers. Zhu Hongxun, the Deputy Secretary of the Supervisory Committee, persisted in open-air operations with the maintenance workers at minus twenty-two degrees Celsius. The workers were very satisfied with this and regarded the leading cadres as ordinary members of the team, telling them many inner thoughts.

Break the old balance, organize a new balance, and always maintain the initiative.

After the leading cadres participate in labor, they can discover many problems hindering the development of production. Some general problems can be discovered and solved at any time in conjunction with the leaders of the workshop or team. But they can only be advisors, not commanders. The solution to major technical problems must be submitted to the chief engineer for approval to prevent taking over and doing everything themselves. When factory-level leading cadres participate in leading production, they focus their attention on key links, constantly breaking the old balance, organizing new balances, and promoting production to move forward, focusing on solving some key problems, and exploring and creating typical experiences that can be promoted throughout the factory in this process. For example, the steelmaking workshop initially had a molding process that lagged behind the electric furnace. After the molten steel was melted, there was no place to pour it. Party Secretary Zhang Hongxue went to the molding team to study the problem and found that the efficiency of sand molds was low. In the past, the highest record for making sand molds for coal car wheels was 70 per shift per person, but the current plan was only 110 in three shifts. He asked the workers: "What kind of car do we need to take to catch up with Britain?" The workers said: "A car!" The Party Secretary said: "If we follow your quota, wouldn't we be riding in an ox cart?" After he did some ideological work, he broke the workers' conservative ideas and fear of raising quotas. Zhang Hongxue then mobilized two Party members to take the lead in catching up with the past advanced records. The next day, each of these two people made 52 molds in less than six hours. Zhang Hongxue felt that the workshop had great potential, and then checked past data, and then launched a "refresh old records, create new records" campaign. As a result, the efficiency of making sand molds was quickly improved, and the efficiency of making coal car wheels was 70-80 per shift per person, greatly exceeding the past records. After the efficiency of the sand molds increased, the electric furnace fell behind again. The Party Secretary then studied the electric furnace problem with the workers. After the engineers observed the operation of the shifts, they found that the operation of the three shifts was not uniform. Some shifts refined a furnace of steel in three and a half hours, and some refined a furnace of steel in five hours. After studying and improving the labor organization and unifying the operation methods of the three shifts, the average increased from refining four furnaces of steel a day in the past to refining five furnaces.

More sensitive to new things and bolder in supporting new things.

To comprehensively improve the work of a factory, it is necessary to constantly overcome weak links. But this cannot rely solely on external forces. The main thing should be to discover and support new things within it. After the leading cadres participate in labor and grasp first-hand materials, they are more sensitive to new things, and they are more confident when they decide to support new things. For example, the fourth workshop used to overhaul electric picks for coal mines, and the project was always delayed last year, and the quality was not good. The various coal mines had very strong opinions. This year, their original plan was to overhaul one unit in thirty days. At the first industrial three-level cadre meeting in Fuxin City, the workers proposed overhauling one unit in twenty days. At that time, some leading cadres expressed doubts. However, Huang Zhaode, the Deputy Party Secretary, was in charge of the "experimental plot" in this workshop, familiar with the situation, and confident, so he advocated strongly supporting this advanced plan. The Party Committee decided to conduct a trial run on No. 72 electric pick. Factory Director Li Xiwu and the Deputy Secretary both followed the shifts and worked with the workers to observe and help solve problems at any time. As a result, the workers completed the overhaul in only eleven days. This greatly boosted the morale of the workers. Then, advanced plans were formulated for various maintenance projects, and they were completed ahead of schedule. Recently, when the workers overhauled the No. 96 electric pick, the advanced plan was to complete it in eight days, but it was actually completed in six days, changing the backward appearance of the fourth workshop.

"Down to the fields" with technical personnel, it is easier to become more specialized if you are red, and it is easier to become red if you are specialized.

After the Party and government leading cadres went deep into the teams to participate in production and participate in leading production, they increasingly felt the urgency of combining with technical forces. Because after the political and ideological work was strengthened, the enthusiasm of the workers was mobilized; the masses naturally had the demand for technical reforms. To realize this demand, it is not enough to rely solely on the combination of Party and government cadres and workers. It is also necessary to combine Party and government leaders with technology and combine labor with technology. Therefore, in the factory's two "experimental plots," Party and government leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel were organized in a unified manner, allowing engineering and technical personnel to also participate in labor after work and participate in the "experimental plot." This more effectively promoted technological reforms. Last year, the steelmaking furnace in the first workshop, which was used as an "experimental plot," decided to promote five advanced experiences, such as using asphalt oil to tamp the furnace bottom and water-cooled furnace doors. However, the furnace bottom that was tamped with asphalt oil was burned through by molten steel, and everyone was unwilling to promote these experiences any further. After Party Secretary Zhang Hongxue went to the steel furnace to work on the "experimental plot" and learned some production technology knowledge, he felt that this experience was very good, and the main reason why it was not well promoted in the past was that he did not learn it thoroughly. So he personally went to a fraternal factory in Fushun to learn it again. But there were still many technical problems in the promotion. He was not sure how to solve them. Later, after studying and organizing the promotion with the assistant engineer and the director of the workshop, dividing responsibilities, the technical transformation project of promoting four advanced experiences such as tamping the furnace bottom with asphalt oil was completed during the Spring Festival holiday. Just promoting the experience of tamping the furnace bottom with asphalt oil alone can reduce furnace repairs by three times a year and refine 120 tons more steel. This kind of combination of all forces; enables Party and government leading cadres to learn a lot of technical theoretical knowledge from technical cadres, which is greatly conducive to Party and government leading cadres solving the problem of "specialization." In the process of combining with Party and government leading cadres, technical personnel also recognized the power of political work. Some engineering and technical personnel used to think that political work was just making reports. Now they see that once the Party Committee launches a campaign, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses immediately rise, the number of people is smaller than in the past, but the tasks are completed even better. After the technical personnel participated in labor, they were deeply moved by the workers' selfless work attitude, and their ideological feelings changed. Some of them also joined the workers in working hard to produce overnight; and when studying and deciding on technical issues, they consulted with the workers and absorbed their opinions. Some even ate and studied with the workers while eating their lunch boxes when making design plans. All of this greatly helps solve the "red" problem of engineering and technical personnel.

An experimental plot promotes the entire factory

One of the purposes of doing the "experimental plot" is to create experience and promote the overall situation. Therefore, it is not enough to only focus on production and technology. It is also necessary to grasp the central work of the moment and grasp the policy issues. Some leading cadres of this factory participated in the rectification and re-examination, the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, and the subsequent great leap forward in production in the workshops and teams. By doing a good job in the central work, the work of the workshops and teams where they are located is improved. Leading cadres participating in the central work can better implement the Party's policies. When Party Secretary Zhang Hongxue participated in leading the great leap forward in production in the first workshop, he especially emphasized the comprehensive implementation of the general line of building socialism by going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and required technical inspectors to carefully check every new record created by the workers. Only when there were no quality problems, it would be officially announced as a new record. Some workers simply relied on physical strength to create new records. While encouraging his enthusiasm, it was not promoted as a direction in the whole team and workshop. This allows the production upsurge to move forward along a healthy path. Many new records have appeared, and there have been no personal accidents or quality accidents. In addition to participating in labor in the teams according to the prescribed time, the leading cadres must also participate in the production meetings of the workshops and all the spare-time activities of the teams, so that they can discover problems in a timely manner and comprehensively grasp the situation.

Doing the "experimental plot" not only helps the workshops and teams where they are located to do a good job, but also promotes the typical experience gained in the "experimental plot" to the entire factory. For example, after Party Secretary Zhang Hongxue launched the "create new record movement" in the first workshop, he convened a celebration meeting in the first workshop together with the administrative leading cadres and organized representatives from various workshops to participate. The meeting commended the deeds of the new record creators and called on the workers of the entire factory to "learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, and catch up with the advanced." In this way, the experience of the first workshop blossomed and bore fruit, setting off a upsurge of "creating new records and catching up with advanced levels" in the entire factory. Within a few days, 41 individuals and 10 teams in the entire factory had created new records in the factory.

New political situation, new interpersonal relations.

After several months of labor, the leading cadres have begun to learn some production technology and have taken a big step towards the direction of "specialization." Although the time is not long, it has enriched the collective leadership of the Party Committee and created favorable conditions for further implementing the system of division of labor and responsibility under the leadership of the Party Committee. In the past, because the members of the Party Committee did not know enough about the actual production situation and the workers, and did not understand technology, when the Party Committee held meetings to discuss production issues, the factory director often spoke first; the secretary supplemented it, and most of the members had no way to speak. Now everyone has their own "base areas." When meetings are held, everyone can talk about a set of things, and the content of the speeches is very rich, and the decisions made are more practical. When implementing the intentions of the Party Committee, it is also fast, accurate, and specific.

Doing the "experimental plot" has greatly strengthened the unity of the staff and workers of the entire factory and has closely linked the relationship between leading cadres and the masses, technical personnel and workers. In the past, because the leading cadres had official airs, sometimes when the leaders went to the workshop, the workers would think: "Something must have happened to us here." Now the leading cadres are working with the workers and have moved their families to the workers' residential area and settled down, appearing as ordinary workers in life and work, and have made friends with the workers and established feelings, making the workers feel that they are truly equal comrades. In the past, when workers and leading cadres met, they would call them "Secretary Zhang" and "Factory Director Li." Now when they meet, they greet each other as "Old Zhang" and "Old Li." The workers take the initiative to approach the leading cadres, not only enthusiastically teaching the leading cadres to learn technology, but even buying movie tickets, they think of bringing one for the leading cadres, and they are willing to tell the leading cadres their inner thoughts.

After the engineering and technical personnel participated in labor and jointly carried out technical reforms with the workers, they also closely linked their relationship with each other. Assistant Engineer Xue Mai said, "In the past, I didn't even know the name of a worker. This time I participated in labor, I know them all and made a lot of friends."

    阜新中央机修厂试验田丰收
    领导作风领导方法彻底革命
    本报阜新电　阜新中央机修厂的“试验田”获得丰收。工厂中出现空前团结的气象，工人们的生产积极性像火山爆发一样喷射出来，把一些主要产品的工作效率提高了四五倍。
    入学考试及格，取得了普通劳动者的资格。
    这个工厂的绝大多数领导干部都是工人出身。在分工参加生产劳动的时候，一般都照顾了个人原来的技术特长；但是厂的几个主要领导干部，还是根据抓关键环节和抓薄弱环节的要求分工的。他们一到车间，便和工人、技术人员订了师徒合同，向工人学习实际操作经验，向技术人员学习技术理论知识，定期进行考试。每个厂级干部每周有十六个小时参加劳动。由于参加夜班劳动，改变了厂级干部和二、三班工人见不着面的情况。他们在劳动的时候，以普通工人的姿态出现，遵守小组的劳动纪律，每次参加劳动后，都由小组长给作鉴定，填写劳动卡片，作为检查考核的材料。
    领导干部在车间里艰苦的劳动，刻苦的学习，对工人发生了很好的影响。党委书记张洪学来到炼钢炉旁，和工人一起扫地、抬料、扒渣。监委副书记朱洪勋在摄氏零下二十二度和检修工人一起坚持露天作业。他们这样做，工人很满意，把领导干部当作小组普通的成员看待了，对他们讲出许多心里话。
    打破旧平衡，组织新平衡，随时掌握主动。
    领导干部参加劳动之后，就能够发现许多阻碍生产发展的问题。对一些一般的问题，可以随时发现随时会同车间或班组的领导人加以解决。但只能当参谋，不能当司令员，重大技术问题的解决，要报请总工程师批准，防止包办代替。厂级领导干部参加领导生产时，注意力集中在关键环节上，围绕着解决一些关键问题，不断地打破旧的平衡，组织新的平衡，推动生产向前发展，并且在这个过程中摸索和创造可以向全厂推广的典型经验。例如：炼钢车间最初是造型落后于电炉，钢水化出来以后没有地方倒，党委书记张洪学就到造型组去研究，发现砂型效率低，做煤车车轮的砂型，过去最高纪录是一个人一班做七十个，可是现在的计划三班只做一百一十个。他就问工人：“咱们得坐什么车赶英国？”工人说：“坐汽车呗！”党委书记说：“要按你们这个定额，不是坐老牛车吗？”经他做了一番思想工作，打破了工人的保守思想和怕提高定额的思想。张洪学又动员两名党员带头赶上过去的先进纪录。第二天，这两个人不到六小时就各做了五十二个。张洪学从这里感到车间有很大潜力，又查过去的资料，接着就发动了一个“刷新旧纪录，创造新纪录”运动。于是做砂型的效率很快就提高了，做煤车车轮的效率，一人一班做七八十个，大大超过了过去的纪录。砂型效率提高之后，电炉又落后了。党委书记就又和工人研究解决电炉问题。经工程师跟班观察，发现三班工人操作不统一，有的三个半小时炼一炉钢，有的五小时炼一炉钢，经过研究改进了劳动组织，统一了三班的操作方法，平均由过去一天炼四炉钢提高到炼五炉。
    对新鲜事物更敏感了，支持新鲜事物更大胆了。
    要使一个厂的工作全面提高，必须不断地克服薄弱环节。但这不能只靠外力，主要的应该是发现和扶持它内部的新鲜事物。领导干部参加劳动之后，掌握了第一手材料，对新鲜事物就比较敏感，决定支持新鲜事物时心里也就更有底。例如，第四车间大修煤矿用的电镐，去年一向拖期，质量也不好，各煤矿意见非常大。今年他们原订计划是三十天大修一台，在阜新市的第一次工业三级干部会议上工人提出二十天大修一台，当时有的领导干部表示怀疑。但是党委副书记黄兆德在这个车间搞“试验田”，熟悉情况，心中有数，就主张大力支持这个先进计划。党委就决定在七十二号电镐试行，厂长李锡文和这位副书记都跟班和工人一起劳动，进行观察和随时帮助解决问题，结果工人们只用了十一天就大修完了。这一下大大鼓起了工人的干劲，接着，在各项检修工程上都订出了跃进的计划，并纷纷提前完成。最近工人们大修九十六号电镐时，提出跃进计划是八天完成，实际六天就完成了，改变了第四车间的落后面貌。
    同技术人员一起“下田”，红的更容易专了，专的更容易红了。
    党政领导干部深入班组参加生产、参与领导生产之后，越来越感觉到和技术力量结合的迫切性。因为政治思想工作加强以后，工人的积极性调动起来了；群众自然就有了改革技术的要求。要实现这个要求，光靠党政干部和工人的结合是不够的，还必须使党政领导和技术相结合，劳动和技术相结合。因此，他们在厂的两个“试验田”中，就把党政领导干部和工程技术人员统一组织起来，让工程技术人员也下班组参加劳动，参加搞“试验田”。这样做，就更有效地推进了技术改革。去年，被作为一个“试验田”的第一车间炼钢炉曾经决定推广沥青油砸炉底、水冷炉门等五项先进经验。可是，用沥青油砸的炉底被钢水烧漏了，大家就都不愿再推广这几项经验。党委书记张洪学到钢炉旁搞“试验田”学到些生产技术知识以后，感到这个经验很好，过去未推广好主要是学得不透。于是他就亲自到抚顺的一个兄弟厂学了一遍。但是推广中还是有许多技术问题，究竟怎样解决，他还是没把握。后来经过和助理工程师、车间主任一起研究和组织推广，分工负责，在春节假期就完成了推广沥青油砸炉底等四项先进经验的技术改造工程。只是推广沥青油砸炉底一项经验，一年就能少修三次炉，多炼一百二十吨钢。各方面力量这样结合；使党政领导干部从技术干部那里学到了许多技术理论知识，大大有利于党政领导干部解决“专”的问题，技术人员在和党政领导干部结合的过程中，也认识了政治工作的威力，有的工程技术人员过去以为政治工作只是作作报告，现在看到党委一发动，群众的积极性创造性马上就高涨起来，人员比过去少了，任务却完成得更好。技术人员参加劳动以后，对工人的忘我的劳动态度深为感动，思想感情起了变化，有的也和工人一起连夜突击生产；并在研究决定技术问题时和工人商量，吸收工人的意见，有的在作设计方案时，夹着饭盒和工人边吃边研究。这一切都大大有助于解决工程技术人员的“红”的问题。
    一块试验田推动全厂
    搞“试验田”的目的之一，就是为了创造经验，推动全面。所以不能只抓生产，只抓技术，还必须抓当前的中心工作，抓方针政策性的问题。这个工厂的一些领导干部，在车间和班组里，都参加了整改复查、反浪费反保守运动及随之而来的生产大跃进等中心工作。通过搞好中心工作，提高所在车间和班组的工作。领导干部参加中心工作，可以更好地贯彻执行党的方针政策。党委书记张洪学在第一车间参加领导生产大跃进的时候，特别强调全面贯彻执行多快好省的方针，要求技术检查员对每个工人创造的新纪录都认真检查，质量没有问题时，才正式宣布为新纪录。有的工人单纯拼体力创造了新纪录，对他本人的热情给予鼓励，但在全组和车间不作为方向来提倡。这就使得生产高潮沿着健康的道路向前发展，新纪录出现了很多，没有发生过人身事故和质量事故。领导干部除了按规定时间到班组参加劳动外，还要参加车间的生产会议和班组的一切业余活动，这样，才能及时地发现问题，全面掌握情况。
    搞“试验田”不仅帮助所在车间和班组把工作作好，还要把在“试验田”里摸索出的典型经验，向全厂推广。如党委书记在第一车间发动起来“创造新纪录运动”之后，就会同行政领导干部在第一车间召开了庆祝大会，组织各车间派代表来参加，大会表扬了新纪录创造者的事迹，号召全厂工人“学先进、比先进、赶先进”，这样，一车间的经验就开花结果了，在全厂掀起了“创造新纪录，向先进水平看齐”的热潮。几天之内，全厂就有四十一个人和十个班组创造了本厂的新纪录。
    新的政治局面，新的人同人的关系。
    经过几个月来的劳动，领导干部都开始学到了一些生产技术，向“专”的方向迈进了一大步。虽然时间还不久，却丰富了党委的集体领导，为进一步贯彻党委领导下的分工负责制创造了有利条件。过去由于党委的成员对生产实际和职工群众了解得不够，又不懂技术，党委开会讨论生产问题的时候，往往是厂长先发言；书记补充一下，大部分委员都无从讲起。现在每个人都有了自己的“根据地”，开起会来，每个人都能讲一套，发言的内容也非常丰富，作出的决定更切合实际。在贯彻党委意图的时候，也迅速、准确、具体。
    搞“试验田”，大大加强了全厂职工的团结，密切了领导干部和群众、技术人员和工人的关系。过去因为领导干部都有官气，有时领导一到车间，工人就想：“我们这里准是出事了。”现在领导干部和工人共同劳动，并把家都搬到工人住宅区落了户，在生活和工作中以普通劳动者一员出现，就和工人交上了朋友，建立了感情，使工人感到真正是平等的同志了。以前工人和领导干部见面都是“张书记”、“李厂长”地叫着，现在见面都是“老张”、“老李”打招呼。工人们都主动接近领导干部，不仅热情地教领导干部学技术，而且连买电影票，都想到给领导干部捎一张，心里话也愿意和领导干部说了。
    工程技术人员参加劳动，和工人共同进行技术改革之后，也密切了相互间的关系，助理工程师薛迈说，过去一个工人的名字我也不知道，这回参加劳动，就都知道了，还交了不少朋友。
