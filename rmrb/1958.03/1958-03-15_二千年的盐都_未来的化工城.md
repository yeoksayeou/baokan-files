A report from our correspondent Li Qian: The city of Zigong, a salt capital with a history of over two thousand years, will be transformed into a chemical industry base. This decision was recently made by the Zigong municipal Party and government leaders and relevant industrial departments based on the results of investigations and research.

In 1957, Zigong's salt production reached 450,000 tons. However, due to high costs (sea salt is more than ten yuan per ton, while Zigong salt is as high as sixty-five to seventy yuan per ton), large-scale sales expansion will be limited in the future. In Zigong's natural brine (especially the black and yellow brines with the largest reserves), in addition to salt, there are also more than 20 kinds of rich chemical elements such as potassium chloride, borax, boric acid, bromine, iodine, strontium, barium, lithium, and magnesium. These elements are indispensable for China's large-scale industrial construction, and many are rare elements that have not been discovered in China or have very small reserves. If these rare elements and salt are extracted from the brine during the production process, developing the chemical industry can not only increase the country's chemical product output, but also greatly reduce salt costs and correspondingly increase salt production.

The utilization of Zigong brine to develop the chemical industry began as early as six years ago. In 1952, the Ministry of Light Industry sent a group of technicians to Zigong to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the brine and bittern, which further proved that most of the chemical elements contained in the brine have extraction value. In order to use these valuable resources for the country's socialist construction, the salt industry department decided to build a chemical plant in Zigong in 1953. Some workshops were put into production that year. Now, six kinds of chemical products have been produced, including boric acid, borax, potassium chloride, bromine, iodine, and barium chloride. Some of these chemical products could not be produced domestically in the past and were completely reliant on imports. After the Zigong Chemical Plant is put into production, it can meet all or most of the country's needs. Because the specific gravity of chemical elements contained in the brine is higher than that in seawater and some ores, and it is easier to extract, the product cost of Zigong Chemical Plant is generally relatively low. For example, the cost of potassium chloride is only half that of the same product from the Northeast Bi Ziwo Chemical Plant. In order to enable brine resources to play a greater role in the country's socialist construction, Zigong Chemical Plant plans to trial-produce and produce five new products this year: strontium nitrate, strontium carbonate, barium carbonate, sodium sulfide, and sodium bromide.

    二千年的盐都　未来的化工城
    本报讯　记者李茜报道：具有两千多年的盐都自贡市将变为化学工业基地。这是自贡市党政领导方面和有关工业部门最近根据调查研究的结果决定的。
    1957年，自贡食盐的产量已经达到四十五万吨。但是，由成本过高（海盐每吨十多元，自贡盐每吨高达六十五元至七十元），今后要大规模的发展销路就受到限制。自贡的天然盐卤中（尤其是蕴藏量最大的黑卤和黄卤）除了含食盐外，还有氯化钾、硼砂、硼酸、溴、碘、锶、钡、锂、镁等二十多种丰富的化学元素。这些元素都是我国大规模的工业建设中不可缺少的东西，很多又是目前国内没有发现或发现的蕴藏量很少的稀有元素。如果在生产过程中，把这些稀有元素和食盐一起从卤水中提炼出来，发展化学工业，不仅可以增加国家的化学产品产量，而且可以大大降低食盐成本，相应地提高食盐产量。
    利用自贡盐卤发展化学工业，早在六年前就开始了。1952年，轻工业部派一批技术人员到自贡市，对盐卤和?巴作全面的分析，进一步证明盐卤中所含的化学元素大部分都有提炼价值。为了使这些宝贵的资源用到国家的社会主义建设中去，1953年盐业部门决定在自贡市建设一座化工厂。当年部分车间就投入了生产。现在，已经生产六种化工产品，其中有硼酸、硼砂、氯化钾、溴素、碘、氯化钡。这些化工产品有些是过去国内不能生产，完全靠国外进口的。自贡化工厂生产后，可以全部或大部满足国家需要。由于卤水中所含化学原素的比重比海水和一些矿石中多，而且容易提炼，自贡化工厂的产品成本一般都比较低。如氯化钾的成本只有东北篦子窝化工厂同样产品的一半。为了使盐卤资源在国家社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用，自贡化工厂计划今年再试制并生产硝酸锶、碳酸锶、碳酸钡、硫化钠、溴化钠等五种新产品。
