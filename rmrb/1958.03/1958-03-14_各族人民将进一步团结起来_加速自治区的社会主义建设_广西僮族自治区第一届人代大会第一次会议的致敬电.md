Congratulatory Telegram to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao

Respected Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao:

We are writing to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao with boundless excitement to report that the first session of the First People's Congress of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region was solemnly held in Nanning on March 5th, solemnly announcing the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. After nine days of meetings, the government work of Guangxi Province over the past eight years was summarized, the future tasks of the autonomous region were decided, and the members of the People's Committee of the autonomous region and the presidents of the higher and intermediate people's courts were elected. During the meeting, Vice Premier He Long, the specially assigned representative, came to guide us in person. Now the conference has come to a successful conclusion. The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is a great happy event in the political life of the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi. As we are warmly celebrating this great happy event, we, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, extend our heartfelt gratitude and lofty respect to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

In the past few years since liberation, under the brilliant light of the Party's great ethnic policy, people of all ethnic groups have worked together to carry out socialist construction, and have achieved great accomplishments in politics, economy, and culture, fundamentally changing the old face of the entire Guangxi. Based on this victory, we believe that after the establishment of the autonomous region, the people of all ethnic groups in our region will surely unite more closely, give full play to socialist enthusiasm, resolutely respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little more; and complete the various tasks stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule. In the next six years, we will strive to achieve an average grain yield of 800 jin per mu in our region; the output value of local industry (including handicrafts) will reach or exceed the output value of agricultural and sideline industries. This is indeed an arduous task, but we are full of confidence to guarantee its completion. We call on the people of all ethnic groups in the region to unite, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, resolutely implement the principles of building the country with diligence and thrift, running the commune with diligence and thrift, running enterprises with diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, as well as the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, to muster revolutionary zeal, and with the spirit of riding the wind and waves, strive for the construction of a prosperous and happy Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and for the socialist construction of our great motherland.

Respectfully,
	
	Lofty salute,

		The First Session of the First People's Congress of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
