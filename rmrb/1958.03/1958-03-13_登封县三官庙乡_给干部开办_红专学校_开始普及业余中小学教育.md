Dengfeng County, Sanguanmiao Township

Opens "Red and Expert School" for Cadres

Begins Popularizing Amateur Primary and Secondary Education

(Our Newspaper's report) In order to solve the problem of cadres being both "Red and Expert," Sanguanmiao Township in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, established a "Red and Expert School" on February 29th. Currently, twenty-seven people are participating in the learning, including the main cadres of the township's agricultural cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, grain supply stations, and county and district cadres who have been working in the township for a long time. To accommodate the cadres' work schedules, the study time is set for every morning. The content of the study mainly includes basic theory, language, natural science knowledge, and a piece of experimental land. This school has no full-time teachers. Philosophy is taught by township and district cadres who have studied at the prefectural party school, botany is taught by literacy cadres who have studied junior high school courses, language is taught by elementary school teachers, and field experiments are guided by cadres from the technical guidance station and experienced farmers. Since its opening, the "Red and Expert School" has held seven classes. Each student has written an article and one or two thousand words of notes. Now, the students are busy preparing for grafting fruit trees, sweet potatoes, and melons, replanting rice, and experimenting with high yields of corn and wheat on the twenty-five mu of experimental land. Their enthusiasm for learning is particularly high. Currently, the General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China in Sanguanmiao Township is formulating a specific one-year and five-year plan, proposing clear goals in theoretical learning, cultural learning, and technical experiments, to help cadres achieve being both Red and Expert as soon as possible.

Also, Sanguanmiao Township in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, after basically eliminating illiteracy, has begun to popularize amateur primary and secondary education throughout the township. All nine agricultural cooperatives in the township have now universally established amateur middle schools, and each production team has established an amateur primary school. While conducting cultural teaching, amateur middle schools also conduct plant lectures and promote new agricultural technologies in the classroom and in the fields, according to seasonal agricultural activities.

    登封县三官庙乡
    给干部开办“红专学校”
    开始普及业余中小学教育
    本报讯  河南省登封县三官庙乡为了解决乡社干部的红专问题，已于2月29日创办了一所“红专学校”。目前参加学习的共二十七人，包括乡农业社、供销社、信用社、粮食供应站等单位的主要干部和长期在乡工作的县区干部。为了适应干部的工作情况，学习时间定为每天早晨。学习的内容主要是基本理论、语文、自然科学知识和一块试验田。这所学校没有专任教师，哲学是由住过地委党校的乡区干部担任，植物学是由学过初中课程的扫盲干部担任，语文课是由小学教师担任，田间实验是由技术指导站的干部和老农担任指导。“红专学校”自开学以来已集中上了七次课。每个学员都写了一篇文章和一、二千字的笔记。现在学员们正在二十五亩试验田上忙着作果树、红薯、瓜类的嫁接、改种水稻和试验玉米、小麦高产的准备工作。他们的学习情绪特别高涨。目前中共三官庙乡总支委员会正在制订一个一年和五年的具体规划，在理论学习文化学习和技术试验等方面提出明确的奋斗目标，以便帮助干部早日达到又红又专。
    又讯　河南省登封县三官庙乡在基本上扫除文盲以后，开始在全乡普及业余中小学教育。全乡九个农业社现在已经普遍建立了业余中学，每个生产队都举办了业余小学。业余中学在进行文化教学的同时，还根据季节性的农事活动，在课堂和田间进行植物讲解和推广农业新技术。
