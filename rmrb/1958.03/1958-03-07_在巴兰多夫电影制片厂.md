    At the Barrandov Film Studio
    By our correspondent Yang Yi
    Czechoslovakia is one of the countries with a relatively developed film industry. As a country with a population of just over 13 million, it has 3,500 cinemas, averaging one cinema for every 3,800 urban and rural residents. Last year, Czechoslovakia produced 682 films, including 27 feature films. In the Czech region alone, more than 810,000 film screenings took place in 1957, with nearly 150 million viewers, averaging 16 film viewings per person per year.
    Czechoslovakian film art has gone through a long development path and has a long history. This year, the whole country is grandly celebrating the sixtieth anniversary of film art, holding and will hold many commemorative meetings, exhibitions and symposiums. In such an atmosphere, we made a special trip to visit the famous Barrandov National Film Studio.
    Barrandov is the most important film studio in Czechoslovakia. This year, the country will shoot 27 feature films, and it will undertake 24 of them. The Czechoslovak comrades introduced to us: It is the largest film studio in Europe.
    The car drove out of the urban area of Prague for about 20 minutes, climbed a hill, and arrived at our destination. The environment here is quiet and the area is spacious, making it an ideal location for a film center. In addition to the Barrandov National Film Studio, a modern film printing factory, a film machinery manufacturing factory, an army film studio, and an animation film studio are also located here.
    We first entered the studio, which is the main part of the film studio. The Barrandov National Film Studio has a total of six studios, as well as a workshop dedicated to shooting special effects, with a total area of 6,400 to 500 square meters. Studios five, six and seven have the latest equipment and are the largest in scale. Studio six has an area of 2,000 square meters, and studios five and seven each have 1,200 square meters, and their height reaches more than four zhang. Therefore, studio six can not only shoot interior scenes, but also be used to shoot exterior scenes. Many wonderful shots of high mountains, dams, and boating are shot in this studio. What is particularly interesting is that these three studios are connected together. When necessary, the middle wall can be automatically lifted up, combining the three studios into a huge studio with an area of 4,400 square meters, which can be used to shoot more magnificent scenes. For example, a scene from the feature film "Jan Hus," which describes the Hussite movement of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, was shot in this way.
    The staff of the film studio are working hard in the studio, some are preparing for the Brussels World Expo, and some are making this year's new feature film. When we visited studio five, people were shooting a new film called "Expectation," which is a feature film with the theme of explaining the meaning of life. It is composed of four stories and is now nearing completion. What we saw was a scene of a wanderer returning home. Most of the staff on site were young men and girls. The director U. Jasli was also very young. He had co-produced with Chinese filmmakers the film "The People's Hearts are One," which recorded the visit of the Czechoslovak Army Cultural Troupe to China. Therefore, he was particularly enthusiastic about us, guiding us around and explaining the content and production design of the film in detail.
    The lighting room also attracted our great attention. The huge room was filled with tall shelves, on which were placed two thousand mercury lamps and carbon arc lamps of various shapes and sizes. The light intensity of the mercury lamps ranged from 500 to 10,000 degrees, and the diameter of the carbon arc lamps ranged from 20 centimeters to 120 centimeters. Each lamp must undergo strict inspection and repair after use, and then be neatly placed on the shelf. Each lamp and its location have detailed classifications and numbers. As long as you check the number plate on the wall, you can easily find the lamp you need from the shelf or the corresponding location in the studio.
    We also admired the perfection of the management of scenery and props. The Barrandov Film Studio has a long history, and there are many old scenery and props, all of which have been well preserved. In the large underground room below the studio, doors, windows, pillars, furniture, utensils, clocks, and all kinds of small props are stored in different categories and in an orderly manner. Everything is available. Each item has a number, and all scenery and props have a catalog and index with pictures and texts. After the items are used, they are stored in order by number, which is very convenient for storage, inspection and use. This not only avoids damage and loss of scenery and props, but also enables them to be fully utilized. Many things can be used like new props with only slight modifications.
    In order to replace bulky and expensive scenery and props, the Barrandov Film Studio pays great attention to the use of lightweight and inexpensive artificial raw materials. For example, there is an artificial building material called "Polyesterele," which can be used to replace cement, bricks and stones for building walls. A ten cubic meter block weighs only ten kilograms and costs only 36 crowns. The price can be reduced in the future after mass production. Artificial plastic is also widely used. The props made of it are very soft, which can make the situation realistic and without any danger when shooting. This substitute is also relatively cheap. According to comrades who are familiar with the situation, in order to promote and encourage saving, the government awards a certain amount of bonuses to the staff who complete the filming task with expenses lower than the planned cost.
    As we bid farewell to the enthusiastic host and walked out of the gate, I stared at the magnificent buildings around me, and a deep respect arose in my heart. The managers of this large factory with 1,700 people are undoubtedly very good housekeepers. They know how to manage, protect and utilize existing property, and know how to carefully save state funds. (Photo attached)

    在巴兰多夫电影制片厂
    本报记者　杨翊
    捷克斯洛伐克是电影事业比较发达的国家之一。作为一个只有一千三百多万人口的国家，它拥有三千五百所电影院，平均每三千八百多个城乡居民就有一家影院。去年一年，捷克斯洛伐克摄制了六百八十二部影片，其中包括二十七部故事长片。单是捷克地区，1957年就放映了八十一万多场电影，观众近一亿五千万人次，平均每人一年看电影十六场。
    捷克斯洛伐克电影艺术经历了较长的发展道路，有着悠久的历史。今年全国各地正在盛大庆祝电影艺术的六十周年，举行了并且还要举行许多纪念会、展览会和座谈会。就在这样的气氛中，我们特地前往参观了享有盛名的巴兰多夫国家电影制片厂。
    巴兰多夫是捷克斯洛伐克最主要的电影制片厂，今年全国要拍摄二十七部艺术片，它就担负了其中的二十四部。捷克斯洛伐克同志向我们介绍：它是欧洲最大的电影制片厂。
    汽车驰出布拉格市区约二十分钟，爬上一个山岗，就到了我们的目的地。这里环境幽静，地区宽敞，是电影中心的理想所在地。除巴兰多夫国家电影制片厂外，现代化的影片洗印厂、电影机械制造厂、陆军电影制片厂和动画片厂也都设在这里。
    我们首先走进了摄影棚，这是电影制片厂的主要部分。巴兰多夫国家电影制片厂共有六个摄影棚，还有一个专拍特技镜头用的车间，总面积达六千四、五百平方公尺。五号、六号和七号三个摄影棚设备最新，规模也最大。六号摄影棚面积二千平方公尺，五号和七号棚也各有一千二百平方公尺，它们的使用高度都达四丈多。因此，六号摄影棚不仅可拍摄内景，而且还可用来拍制外景，许多高山、水坝、划船的精彩镜头都是在这个摄影棚内摄制的。特别饶有兴趣的是这三个摄影棚连接在一起，必要时，中间的墙壁可以自动吊上去，把三个摄影棚合成为一个面积达四千四百平方公尺的巨大摄影棚，可用来拍摄更为宏伟的场面，例如描写十四和十五世纪胡斯运动的艺术片“杨·胡斯”中的一景，就是这样摄制的。
    制片厂的工作人员正在摄影棚内紧张地工作着，有的在为参加布鲁塞尔世界博览会作准备，有的在制作今年的新故事片。当我们参观五号摄影棚时，人们正在拍摄一部名为“期待”的新片，这是一部以阐述生活的意义为题材的艺术片，由四个故事组成，现在已接近完成，我们看到的是游子归家的一个场面。现场的工作人员多是青年小伙子和姑娘，导演乌·雅斯利也很年轻，他曾和中国电影工作者合拍过记录捷克斯洛伐克军队文工团访华活动的影片“人民心一条”，因此对我们特别热情，引导我们到处参观，详细解释影片内容和摄制的设计。
    照明间也引起了我们极大的注意。巨大的屋子里摆满了高架子，上面放了两千个形形色色的水银灯和炭精灯。水银灯的光度从五百度到一万度的都有，炭精灯的直径也是从二十公分到一百二十公分不等。每盏灯使用后都要经过严格的检验和修理，然后整齐地安放在架子上。每个灯和它所在的位置都有详细的分类和编号，只要一查墙上的号码牌，就可以很容易地从架子上或摄影棚内的相应位置上找到你所需要的那盏灯。
    布景道具管理的完善也使我们称羡不置。巴兰多夫电影制片厂已有多年历史，旧的布景道具很多，它们全被很好地保管了起来。就在摄影棚下面的大地下室内，分门别类、井然有序地贮藏着门窗、柱子、家具、器皿、钟表以及各式各样的小道具，琳琅满目，应有尽有。每件东西都有编号，所有布景道具都备有图片和文字的目录与索引，东西用完后都顺序按号收存起来，保管、检查和使用都非常方便。这样不仅避免了布景道具的损坏和遗失，而且能使它们得到充分利用。许多东西只需稍加修改，就可以像新道具一样使用。
    为了代替笨重而昂贵的布景道具，巴兰多夫电影制片厂很注意使用轻便、价廉的人造原料。如有一种名叫“波利斯特勒列”的人造建筑原料，可以代替水泥、砖块和石头砌墙用，十立方公尺大小的一块，不过十公斤重，价格仅三十六克朗，将来大量生产后，价格还可降低。人造塑胶也被普遍使用，用它制成的道具非常柔软，拍摄时可使情景逼真而又无任何危险，这种代用品也比较便宜。据熟悉情况的同志告诉我，为了提倡和鼓励节约，政府对于用低于计划成本的费用完成摄制任务的工作人员，颁发一定数额的奖金。
    当我们告别殷勤的主人走出大门时，我凝视着四周宏伟的建筑，心中激起了深深的敬意。这个一千七百人的大工厂的管理者无疑是一些很好的当家人，他们懂得如何管理、保护和利用现有财产，懂得怎样细心地节约国家资金。（附图片）
