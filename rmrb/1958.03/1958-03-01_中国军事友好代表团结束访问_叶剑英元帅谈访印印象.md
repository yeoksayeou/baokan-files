Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 27th. Marshal Ye Jianying expressed his gratitude for the hospitality the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation received at a gathering here today to celebrate the end of the visit, and described his impressions of the visit to India.

Marshal Ye Jianying pointed out, "First of all, we feel that they are very patriotic, and they believe that defending the independence of their motherland is their duty and honor; secondly, they possess the knowledge and skills required of them in all aspects, and they are cultured people; thirdly, they love peace and are proud of having participated in peacekeeping work in Korea, Indochina, and Egypt, which is entirely justified; fourthly, we are very pleased to find that they are all very friendly to our country, treat us like brothers, and warmly hope that the fraternal friendship between the armed forces of China and India will be further developed."

While analyzing the commonalities between India and China, Marshal Ye Jianying mentioned what Indian Prime Minister Nehru said during his visit to Beijing three years ago. Prime Minister Nehru said that a giant would appear in Asia, whose head would be Panchsheel, whose spine would be the Himalayas, and whose body would be hundreds of millions of Chinese and Indian people, and he would defend the lasting peace of Asia and the world.

Among those attending the gathering were Army Chief of Staff General Thimayya, Air Force Chief of Staff Air Marshal Mukerjee, Navy Deputy Chief of Staff Commodore Chakravarti, and other senior officers from the Ministry of Defence and the three services of the Indian Armed Forces.

At the meeting, Thimayya, on behalf of the Indian Armed Forces, extended his greetings to all members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He presented the delegation with a silver Indian national emblem. Mukerjee and Chakravarti presented the delegation with the emblems of the Indian Air Force and Navy, respectively.

Marshal Ye Jianying, on behalf of the Chinese Navy, Army, and Air Force, presented the three Indian services with the emblems of the three Chinese services, respectively.

This afternoon, Marshal Ye and members of the delegation bid farewell to Defence Minister Menon. The delegation will leave here on February 28 to visit the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works in Asansol, and then visit Calcutta before leaving India and returning home.

    叶剑英元帅谈访印印象
    据新华社新德里27日电  叶剑英元帅今天在这里庆祝中国军事友好代表团访问结束的集会上，对代表团受到的招待表示感谢，并且叙述了访问印度的印象。
    叶剑英元帅指出，“首先，我们觉得他们是十分爱国的，他们认为保卫自己祖国的独立是他们的义务和荣誉；其次，他们具备了要求他们的各方面的知识和技能，而且他们是有文化的人；第三，他们爱好和平，并且以曾经在朝鲜、印度支那和埃及参加过维护和平的工作而引为自豪，而这是完全正当的；第四，我们非常高兴地发现他们全都对我国非常友好，待我们像兄弟一样，热烈希望中国和印度两国武装部队之间的兄弟友谊得到进一步发展。”
    叶剑英元帅在分析印度和中国之间的共同点的时候，提到了印度总理尼赫鲁三年前在北京访问时所说的话。尼赫鲁总理曾经说，亚洲会出现一个巨人，他的头是潘查希拉，脊骨是喜马拉雅山，身体是亿万中国人民和印度人民，他将保卫亚洲和世界的持久和平。
    参加这次集会的有陆军参谋长蒂迈雅将军，空军参谋长、空军元帅慕克吉，海军副参谋长、海军准将查克拉瓦蒂以及国防部和印度武装部队三军的其他高级军官。
    蒂迈雅在会上代表印度武装部队，向中国人民解放军全体人员致意。他把银质的印度国徽赠给代表团。慕克吉和查克拉瓦蒂分别把印度空军和海军的徽章赠给代表团。
    叶剑英元帅代表中国海、陆、空三军把三军的徽章分别赠予印度的三军。
    今天下午，叶元帅和代表团成员向国防部长梅农辞行。代表团将于2月28日离开这里，到阿散索尔去参观奇塔兰詹机车厂，然后在离开印度回国以前，再去加尔各答访问。
