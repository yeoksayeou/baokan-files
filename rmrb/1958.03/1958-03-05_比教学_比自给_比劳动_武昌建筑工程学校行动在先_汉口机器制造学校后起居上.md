Comparing Teaching, Comparing Self-Sufficiency, Comparing Labor
    Wuhan Construction Engineering School Takes the Lead
    Hankou Machine Manufacturing School Rises from Behind

    (Our Wuhan News) The Wuhan Construction Engineering School of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has proposed a three-year hard struggle to break with conventions and implement a teaching system of one month of vacation, four months of labor production, and seven months of business theory study in one year, and strive to be fully self-sufficient in school funding this year.

    The Wuhan Construction Engineering School's plan of "fighting hard for three years to completely renovate the school's outlook" includes three aspects: First, develop production. It plans to contract engineering tasks related to civil buildings, some small factory buildings, and water supply and drainage, with four to five hundred of the school's more than 1,400 students taking turns participating in construction tasks. Make full use of the technical equipment of the school's practice factory to contract some projects from related construction engineering companies; teachers, students, and staff staying at the school will use their spare time for land reclamation, vegetable planting, pig raising, and tree planting. After this plan is completed, it can increase the school's wealth by 616,000 yuan this year, which is 60,000 yuan more than the school's budget of 550,000 yuan; Second, be diligent and thrifty. Organize students to participate in paid labor at the school's quarry and survey team; strictly control administrative expenses and promote the use of waste materials; Third, improve the teaching system. Starting from this semester, the "one, four, seven" teaching system will be implemented, requiring teachers to work at least 200 labor days in labor production within three years, master the operating skills of one or two types of work, reach a technical level above that of a fourth-grade worker, and become a new type of people's teacher who can teach, educate, and produce.

    The school has now contracted a portion of the project, valued at approximately 600,000 yuan, and more than 700 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed, with more than 20 mu planted with vegetables and more than 100,000 jin of fertilizer accumulated.

    The Ministry of Construction Engineering held an on-site meeting in Wuchang on March 1 to promote the experience of this school. Principals and relevant teaching staff from national civil engineering schools and urban construction schools participated.

    (Our News) The Hankou Machine Manufacturing School of the First Ministry of Machine Building guarantees to comprehensively improve the quality of education in three years and begin to be fully self-sufficient in funding this year.

    All faculty, staff, and students of the school decided to challenge the Wuhan Construction Engineering School of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, and issued a friendly challenge to universities, secondary technical schools, and brother schools affiliated with the First Ministry of Machine Building in the Wuhan area. They guarantee to work hard for three years to fundamentally change the school's outlook, comprehensively improve the quality of education, and ensure that teachers achieve four abilities, namely, the ability to educate people, teach, produce, and guide internships; and that students achieve four qualities, namely, good health, good study, good work, and good labor production. All faculty and staff will participate in industrial and agricultural or sideline production, reaching 200-300 labor days per person within three years, and learn to master an industrial or agricultural production skill. This year, the school will organize all faculty, staff, and students to participate in practice factories, various laboratories, and agricultural and sideline production. The total output value in one year can reach one million yuan, and after deducting the cost of materials, 600,000 yuan can be obtained. The school's budget for this year is 540,000 yuan, so not only can it be completely self-sufficient in funding, but there will also be a surplus. Currently, the school has signed contracts with relevant units and will produce 2,000 water pumps this year to support the great leap forward in agricultural production, produce 200 drilling machines, 3,000 Czech-style live centers, and 150 blowers. The quality of these machines will reach the production level of Shanghai enterprises, and the milling machine flat-mouth vises they produce are required to meet export standards.

    The indicators for running the school diligently and thriftily proposed by the Hankou Machine Manufacturing School have exceeded the challenge indicators of the Wuhan Construction Engineering School of the Ministry of Construction Engineering.

    比教学　比自给　比劳动
    武昌建筑工程学校行动在先
    汉口机器制造学校后起居上
    本报武汉讯　中央建筑工程部武昌建筑工程学校提出了苦战三年，打破常规，实行在一年中假期一个月，劳动生产四个月，业务理论学习七个月的教学制度，并争取今年学校经费全部自给自足。
    武昌建筑工程学校“苦战三年，彻底革新学校面貌”的规划包括三个方面：一、开展生产。计划承包有关民用建筑、部分小型厂房和上下水道等工程任务，由全校一千四百多个学生中轮流抽出四、五百人参加施工任务。充分利用学校的实习工厂的技术设备，承包有关建筑工程公司的一些工程；留校师生员工利用业余时间进行开荒、种菜、养猪、植树等。这个计划完成后，今年可为学校增加财富六十一万六千元，比学校今年的经费预算五十五万元还多出六万元；二、勤俭节约。组织学生参加学校的采石场、测量队等有一定报酬的劳动；严格控制行政费用，提倡利用废物；三、改进教学制度。从本学期起，实行“一、四、七”教学制度，要求教师在三年内的劳动生产中，最少做到二百个劳动日，掌握一、二个工种的操作技能，达到四级工人以上的技术水平，成为会教书、会教人、会生产的新型人民教师。
    该校现已承包一部分工程，造价约值六十万元，全校七百多亩荒地已开垦出来，有二十多亩种了蔬菜，积肥十余万斤。
    中央建筑工程部于3月1日在武昌召开了现场会议，推广这所学校的经验。参加的有全国土木建筑工程学校、城市建设学校等校长和有关教学人员。
    本报讯　第一机械工业部汉口机器制造学校保证三年全面提高教育质量，今年开始经费全部自给。
    该校全体教职工学生决定向建筑工程部武昌建筑工程学校应战，并向武汉地区大专学校、中等技术学校和第一机械工业部所属兄弟学校作友谊的挑战。他们保证苦战三年，从根本上改变学校面貌，全面提高教育质量，教师做到四能，即能教人、能教书、能生产、能指导实习；学生做到四好，即身体好、学习好、工作好、劳动生产好。全校教职员参加工农业或副业生产，三年内每人达到二百——三百个劳动日，学会掌握一门工业或农业生产技能。今年组织全校教职工学生参加实习工厂、各实验室及农副业生产，一年内生产总产值可达一百万元，除去工本费可以获得六十万元，预算今年全校经费五十四万元，这样不仅完全能够做到经费自给自足，而且还有剩余。目前该校已经和有关单位签订了合同，将在今年内生产二千台抽水机，支援农业生产大跃进，生产二百台钻床、三千个捷克式活顶针、一百五十台鼓风机，这些机械质量将达到上海企业单位的生产水平，他们生产的铣床平口虎钳要求达到出口标准。
    汉口机器制造学校所提出的勤俭办校指标，已经超过了建筑工程部武昌建筑学校的挑战指标。
