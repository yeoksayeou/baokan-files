Baotou, March 26 (Reported by our newspaper) - The economic departments of the Baotou Municipal People's Committee and the central enterprises in Baotou have recently reached an agreement on carrying out socialist collaboration in the construction of the Baotou Heavy Industrial Base, and have in principle approved two agreements for collaborative construction between central enterprises and between central and local enterprises. The two agreements include a total of thirteen collaborative construction projects. They stipulate that Baotou Iron and Steel (Baogang) and other central enterprises will jointly use five non-metallic mines such as dolomite, clay, and limestone, with the main user enterprise investing in mine construction and operation, or with the user units sharing the investment and handing it over to local authorities for unified operation; Baogang and other large enterprises will mutually supply processed construction materials and production materials, and units with smaller needs will not build separate processing facilities; central enterprises will no longer build separate factories and workshops for materials that can be satisfied by Baotou's local industry, or repair tasks that can be undertaken by it. According to the determined collaborative projects, the city can reduce the construction of an oxygen plant, an electrode welding manufacturing workshop, an auto repair shop, a lime kiln, and two hospitals with 200 beds each. Among them, the oxygen plant and auto repair shop alone can save more than 2.3 million yuan in investment.

During the construction of the Baotou industrial base, due to the lack of organizational planning experience on the part of the leadership, as well as the "big factory" mentality and departmentalism of some central enterprises, there has been a phenomenon of seeking novelty and completeness in many auxiliary facilities, with each setting up its own stall and doing its own thing. According to an investigation by the economic departments, the repair capacity of the Baotou local state-owned auto repair factory can undertake all auto overhaul tasks in Baotou in the next few years, but the equipment utilization rate of this repair factory last year was only 55.5%. However, some large factories have successively built auto repair workshops that undertake major and medium repairs, and those with only minor repair facilities also want to add major repair facilities. The local state-owned oxygen plant only operated one of its two oxygen generators last year, and still had 60% of its products looking for sales in Shijiazhuang, Handan and other places, while Baogang originally planned to build an oxygen workshop specifically for construction purposes. This not only wastes investment, stockpiles equipment and products, but also prevents the potential of local industry from being brought into play. Not long ago, some local industrial units were worried that central enterprises would not use their products and did not dare to leap forward.

At the end of the first Five-Year Plan, the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Construction Committee discovered this contradiction and began to solve it, but with little success. The main reason is that some large enterprises have the aforementioned ideological problems, fearing that the products supplied by local industry and the repair tasks undertaken are of poor quality, fearing that they will affect the progress, and are not at ease with local industry. There were also fears of disputes between each other. Some local industrial units did have shortcomings such as low product quality and high costs, had conservative ideas, and were afraid that they could not complete the tasks with quality and quantity after undertaking them, and did not dare to undertake them.

The double-anti movement in the past month has broken through the independent departmentalism of large enterprises and the backward conservatism of local enterprises. All units, starting from the perspective of 600 million people, proposed mutual support and common leap forward. The units under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry also cancelled their original plan to build their own auto repair workshop, and returned more than 80 new machine tools that had been ordered, and decided to send the cars to the local auto repair factory for repair. Local industrial units have also put forward leap forward plans and measures to reduce costs and improve quality, guaranteeing to serve large enterprises well.

### 大企业不单干　小企业不保守  包头工业基地大协作

    大企业不单干　小企业不保守
    包头工业基地大协作
    本报包头26日电　包头市人民委员会的经济工作部门和在包头的中央企业，最近达成了建设包头重工业基地中开展社会主义大协作的协议，并且原则上通过了中央企业之间，中央企业和地方企业之间两项协作建设的协议书。两个协议书共包括十三个协作建设项目。其中规定：包钢和其他中央企业共同使用白云石、粘土、石灰石等五座非金属矿山，由主用企业投资建矿和经营，或由各使用单位分摊投资，交地方统一经营；包钢等各大企业互相供应加工的建筑等材料和生产用材料，用得少的单位不另建加工设施；包头地方工业能满足的材料，能承担的修理任务，中央企业不再另建厂矿和车间。根据已确定的协作项目，全市就可少建一个氧气厂，一个电焊条制造车间，一个汽车修配车间，一座石灰窑和两所各二百张病床的医院。其中，仅氧气厂和汽车修配车间两项，就节约投资二百三十多万元。
    在包头工业基地的建设中，由于领导上缺乏组织规划经验，以及某些中央企业的大厂思想和本位主义作怪，在不少辅助设施上有贪新求全、各摆一摊、各搞一套的现象。据经济工作部门调查，包头地方国营汽车修配厂的修配能力，在今后几年里能承担包头市全部汽车大修的任务，这个修配厂去年的设备利用率仅达55.5％。而一些大厂却相继建设了承担大中修的汽车修配车间，只有中小修设施的，还想增建大修设施。地方国营氧气厂两台制氧机去年只开动一台，还有十分之六的产品到石家庄、邯郸等地找销路，而包钢原计划还要兴建一个专为建筑用的氧气车间。这不仅浪费投资、积压设备和产品，同时使地方工业的潜力不能发挥，不久前一些地方工业单位就耽心中央企业不用他们的产品而不敢跃进。
    第一个五年计划末期，中共包头市委和市建设委员会就发现了这个矛盾，并着手解决，但成绩不大。主要是一些大企业有上述思想问题，怕地方工业供应的产品和担任的修理任务质量差，怕影响进度，对地方工业不放心不放手，互相之间也怕扯皮。而地方工业有些单位，确实存在产品质量低、成本高等弱点，有保守思想，怕承担任务后不能按质按量完成，不敢承揽。
    近一个月的双反运动，冲破了大企业的单干本位思想和地方企业的落后保守状态。各单位都从六亿人民出发，提出互相支援、共同跃进。第一机械工业部所属单位，原拟自建汽车修配车间的计划也勾销了，已订好的八十多台新式机床退了货，决定把汽车送到地方汽车修配厂去修。地方工业各单位，也纷纷提出了跃进规划和降低成本提高质量的措施，保证为大企业服务得好。
