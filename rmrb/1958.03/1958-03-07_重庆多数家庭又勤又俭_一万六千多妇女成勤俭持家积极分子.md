Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 6th. Over 16,200 active advocates of diligent and thrifty household management have emerged in Chongqing.

According to key investigations in the streets and suburban rural areas, approximately 90% of families in Chongqing are both diligent and thrifty, or diligent but not thrifty enough. Some families with very high incomes can also be diligent and thrifty. Gong Shibao, the wife of an engineer, has a family of seven, and her husband earns a monthly salary of 180 yuan. However, she is meticulous in her calculations and saves money in every possible way. For example, she discovered that her neighbors were using both dry firewood and sawdust as fuel for cooking. She decided to switch to burning sawdust, which has strong firepower and costs only five cents for thirty catties. She even carries it home from the sawmill herself. Over the past six years, she has saved nearly 6,000 yuan in money and public bonds.

A small number of women from families with difficulties who previously relied on government subsidies and relief actively participate in various sideline productions to increase household income. Wang Suzhen, the wife of a flower worker, gets up early and works late to carry coal ash for nearby nurseries in order to overcome her family's economic difficulties. The fuel her family uses for the year is also carefully selected from the coal ash. She can also sell the evenly sifted coal ash for more than ten yuan a year to supplement her family's income.

    重庆多数家庭又勤又俭
    一万六千多妇女成勤俭持家积极分子
    据新华社重庆6日电　重庆市已经涌现出一万六千二百多名勤俭持家积极分子。
    据街道、郊区农村的重点调查，重庆市作到又勤又俭，或者勤劳而俭节不够的家庭约占90％左右。有些收入虽然很多的家庭，也能做到克勤克俭。一位工程师的妻子龚世宝，全家七口，丈夫月薪收入一百八十元，但是她精打细算，处处节约，例如发现邻居煮饭时兼干柴和锯木末两种燃料，她就决定改烧火力很强、五分钱就可买三十斤的锯木末，并且自己到锯木厂去背回家来。六年来，她节余的钱和购买的公债近六千元。
    少数家庭困难，原来依靠政府补助、救济的妇女，积极参加各种副业生产，来增加家庭收入。栽花工人的妻子王素珍，为了克服家庭经济困难，起早贪黑地为附近的托儿所挑炭灰；她家一年用的燃料，也是取精挑细从炭灰中选出来的；一年还能把筛得均匀的炭灰卖十多元钱来贴补家用。
