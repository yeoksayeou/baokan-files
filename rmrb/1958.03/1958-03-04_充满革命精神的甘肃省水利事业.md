Gansu Province's Water Conservancy Undertaking Filled with Revolutionary Spirit
By Our Correspondent Gu Lei

(I) Advancing Through Numerous Difficulties

    Gansu Province's water conservancy construction is advancing by leaps and bounds. Gansu farmers are proving to the people of the whole country with facts: even under extremely difficult conditions, it is possible to overcome drought and rapidly change the face of nature.
    Gansu is located on a plateau, mostly mountainous, with plains generally at an altitude of over 1,500 meters. The province has no large lakes and is far from the ocean, often subject to northern wind and sandstorms, and the climate is extremely dry. The average annual rainfall is about 300 millimeters, making it the driest place in the country, historically prone to drought.
    According to relatively reliable statistics, from 1644 to 1906, a period of 262 years, there were 114 major and minor droughts, an average of once every 2.3 years. During the 260 years of the Qing Dynasty, the average was once every two years, and during the Kuomintang rule, it was more than once a year. There is a saying: "Small drought every three years, major drought every five years." Opening the provincial chronicles, prefectural chronicles, and county chronicles of Gansu, one can see such records everywhere: "Severe drought, people starving, many selling their children into slavery"; "People starving, corpses lying on the roads, people displaced and wandering"; "By summer, even the bark of trees was eaten bare by the people, and grass roots were also eaten up, corpses piled up in the streets, the stench unbearable, people eating each other, some even grinding bones and digging up corpses"; "Crops withered, tens of thousands died of starvation"...
    In order to survive, the people have long persisted in fighting against drought, with many valuable creations. Today, one can still see the canals opened in the Qin and Han dynasties. During a major drought in the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty, all the crops withered. A farmer discovered a few wheat plants growing vigorously on a sand pile at the entrance of a rat hole, realizing that spreading sand could resist drought and creating the method of sand-covered fields, which has always been an effective measure to combat drought. Now, after identification by scientists, it is believed that this kind of sand field has high permeability, low evaporation, and resistance to heat, moisture retention, insulation, and alkali suppression, and the yield is one to three times higher than that of the same land, and the maturity period is ten days to half a month earlier. However, in a society ruled by reactionary classes, the wisdom and creativity of the people were stifled. When Gansu was liberated in 1949, the province had only 6.26 million mu of irrigated and watered land, less than one-tenth of the total cultivated area, and less than five fen per person on average. Many existing canals were unable to guarantee irrigation due to disrepair, resulting in poor harvests year after year. The broad masses of people lived a life of "wild vegetables and potatoes made into batter, filling the stomach is all that matters." A folk song sang: "Monk's head on the mountain, no water flowing in the ditch, suffering from drought every year, everyone is worried!"
    After the liberation of Gansu, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to develop agricultural production, first grasped the practical situation of drought. They realized that in Gansu, water is grain, water is life! Water is the fundamental link in developing and consolidating the cooperative movement, ensuring the complete victory of socialism in the countryside, and leading farmers from poverty to a prosperous life. Therefore, for several years, they have unremittingly led the people of the province to launch a massive water conservancy construction movement.
    In Gansu, the process of water conservancy construction is actually a process of fighting against various difficulties. Gansu Province faces many difficulties. First, the historical foundation left behind was too poor. To get rid of the threat of drought as soon as possible, it is necessary to turn more than 60 million mu of dry land into irrigated and watered land, which means increasing by more than five mu per person, and the workload is considerable. Second, rainfall is scarce and concentrated in the autumn, coupled with the unclear water source situation, which increases the difficulty of comprehensive planning, comprehensive utilization, and water conservancy construction. Third, the terrain is mostly mountainous and sparsely wooded, and the soil erosion area of the province is 255,000 square kilometers. The soil erosion area in the Yellow River basin alone reaches 210,000 square kilometers, with an annual loss of 450 million cubic meters of sediment. As a result, a large amount of land is barren and droughts occur constantly. Water conservancy construction must be carried out simultaneously with soil and water conservation, and the task is arduous. Fourth, this was originally a grain-deficient province, the farmers' lives were relatively poor, and the area is large and the population is sparse, with only 25 people per square kilometer. There is a feeling that there is insufficient manpower and material resources for water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation. Fifth, the mountainous area is large, and 87% of the cultivated land area is on the mountains and tablelands. To achieve water conservancy, water must be led to the mountains, the project is arduous, and the technology is complex. Sixth, as a result of long-term drought, certain fears of nature have been left in the minds of the masses, and the habitual forces of relying on the heavens for food are quite large, which increases the resistance to water conservancy construction.
    The water conservancy undertaking of Gansu Province is leaping forward with a revolutionary spirit under these difficult conditions. By the end of last year, the province had nearly 20 million mu of irrigated and watered land, accounting for nearly 30% of the cultivated area. The area of irrigated land increased in the past eight years is more than three times the area of irrigated land before liberation. The drought resistance capacity of these irrigated lands is generally about 60 days; coupled with other drought resistance measures, they can basically get rid of the threat of general droughts; even in the event of particularly large droughts, the tragic scenes that occurred in history will never occur again. Due to the large-scale water conservancy construction in Gansu Province, the province has changed from a grain-deficient province to a surplus grain province. In 1949, the province only produced 4.6 billion jin of grain, which was not enough to eat. By 1956, grain output reached 10.9 billion jin, and in 1957, due to some disasters, it still produced 10.13 billion jin, allowing the farmers of Gansu to get rid of poverty forever, not only having enough to eat but also having a surplus.
    Precisely because the water conservancy undertaking of Gansu Province has developed under very difficult conditions, it has even more exemplary significance—it gives us the belief that if Gansu Province can overcome drought, other places in the country can overcome drought even faster!
  (II) Overthrowing Rightism and Encouraging Revolution
    Gansu Province's advance toward the goal of water conservancy under extremely drought-stricken conditions is a revolution against nature. This revolution is to master the laws of nature, eliminate its unfavorable aspects for the people's lives, and use its favorable aspects to benefit the people; this revolution is to reverse the history of the past thousands of years and strive to accomplish in a short period of time what predecessors have not done, could not do, and dared not imagine, and strive to fundamentally change the history of drought in a very short period of time. In this struggle, the decisive factor is people, is people's labor. This cannot but reflect the struggle in people's minds. The facts of Gansu Province prove that if you want to revolutionize nature, you must first carry out a revolution in people's minds. It is impossible to conquer nature without winning in the ideological struggle. The development process of Gansu Province's water conservancy undertaking has always been permeated with the struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking, and water conservancy construction is actually also a major construction of Marxist-Leninist thought. The focus of this struggle is: should people succumb to nature, or should they change the face of nature through subjective efforts!
    In the past, some cadres exaggerated the backwardness of Gansu. When talking about natural conditions, they always emphasized the difficulties of scarce rainfall, frequent droughts, large temperature differences, difficulty in crop growth, vast areas, thousands of ravines, barren mountains, blocked transportation, and wide range of governance; when mentioning economic conditions, they always emphasized thin land, poor people, poor living, lack of materials, and various poor conditions; when talking about social conditions, they always emphasized the complexity of ethnic conditions, sparse population, historical backwardness, and the masses' lack of habit of water conservancy construction. Although there is some truth in these arguments, in the eyes of right-leaning conservatives, many difficulties are insurmountable. They regard Gansu as a desolate desert, impossible to transform or impossible to transform quickly; some people even feel disgusted with this place. They look at objective things statically and in isolation, ignoring the role of people, thus generating negative and retreating emotions, emphasizing backwardness, advocating backwardness, spreading pessimistic arguments, lacking revolutionary intentions, advocating that everything should be done slowly, waiting for the gifts of nature. This is a tendency to undermine the cause of socialist construction, which is the main current in the countercurrent of the "Gansu Backwardness" theory widely prevalent in Gansu before 1956.
    The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attached importance to the struggle against this anti-Marxist-Leninist ideological countercurrent. The facts of the past few years have proved that whenever this evil trend is suppressed, various undertakings will inevitably leap forward; otherwise, they will stagnate.
    In the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956, the Provincial Party Committee launched a critique of the "Gansu Backwardness" theory throughout the province. In the process of criticism, it was pointed out that the "Gansu Backwardness" theory is right-leaning opportunism, its theoretical basis is bourgeois metaphysics, its class root is the reflection of landlord and bourgeois ideology within the Party; its existence is harmful to the cause of socialist construction. At the same time, the cadres of the province were educated: Communists should treat objective things with the method of dialectical materialism, both seeing the difficulties and seeing the favorable factors; Communists should not only transform society but also transform nature, no matter how many difficulties there are on this road; Communists' attitude towards difficulties should be revolutionary offense, not fear and retreat.
    This criticism lasted for five months and achieved significant results. In the winter of 1955, the number of farm households participating in agricultural cooperatives in the province leaped from 9.6% to 98.18%, basically completing the socialist transformation of the countryside. According to the situation of the leap forward of agricultural cooperativization, the Provincial Party Committee immediately mobilized the whole Party to strive to launch a production upsurge. The main measure was to further grasp the work of water conservancy construction. On the one hand, it pointed out that the favorable conditions for overcoming various difficulties and building water conservancy are: the criticism of the "Gansu Backwardness" theory has boosted the revolutionary enthusiasm of the cadres; after the basic realization of agricultural cooperativization, the productive forces of the countryside have been liberated; due to long-term drought, the farmers have a strong desire to build water conservancy and overcome drought; after investigation, the province has 60 billion cubic meters of surface water, plus rainwater and groundwater, which can develop 70 million mu of irrigated land, and there are sufficient conditions to achieve water conservancy; the masses have many effective experiences in repairing irrigated land, which can be done with half the effort with effective summary and promotion. On the other hand, it instructed Party organizations at all levels to "start with the secretary and personally take charge" when carrying out the water conservancy movement. In this way, the water conservancy undertaking appeared a first peak in 1956, with 4.36 million mu of irrigated land built, equal to the total sum of newly built irrigated land in the years after liberation. The total grain output reached 10.9 billion jin, an increase of 2.6 billion jin compared with 1955, and the output per mu increased from less than 100 jin at the time of liberation to 175 jin; each agricultural population had an average grain ownership of 740 jin after the purchase of grain, an increase from 507 jin in 1952.
    In 1957, in order to consolidate the existing achievements, sum up experience, and accumulate strength in a big leap forward, and prepare for another big leap forward, the Provincial Party Committee appropriately slowed down its pace in some work, which was correct. At this time, the right-leaning ideas of some people rose again. They used this practice to counter the past, thinking that 1956 was "rash," exaggerating some of the shortcomings in water conservancy construction. When the rightists attacked the Party and completely negated the achievements of socialist construction, they had the same feelings on some issues and did not actively complete the tasks stipulated. Due to the rise of right-leaning ideology, the task of building paddy fields in 1957 was actually reduced from the original plan of 3 million mu to 2.5 million mu. It could not be distributed, and then reduced to 2 million mu, but it still could not be distributed, and it was reduced to 1.12 million mu, and finally only 74% of the plan was completed. In many places, it was "water flowing, drought, and people shouting." This year, the total grain output only reached 10.1 billion jin. Although the main reason was due to the disaster, it was also related to the lack of active water conservancy construction.
    In 1957, the province launched a rectification movement. After the anti-rightist struggle, a mass campaign of airing views, contending, and debating was launched in the countryside, and new victories were achieved on the political and ideological fronts. Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, various places generally criticized right-leaning conservative ideas, which immediately made the water conservancy undertaking appear a second peak. From last winter to January 20 this year, in a period of four months, various places fully utilized positive factors and, through subjective efforts, have expanded the irrigation area by 5.1 million mu, which is more than twice the irrigation area expanded in the first peak, and five times that in 1957. From leading cadres to the masses, the idea that man will conquer nature has been firmly established, and revolutionary enthusiasm has been boosted. This is the result of persisting in the struggle against right-leaning conservative ideas. It is an extraordinary struggle, and in essence, it is a political and ideological struggle. Gansu Province has achieved a decisive victory in this regard, laying a solid ideological foundation for the realization of water conservancy.

    充满革命精神的甘肃省水利事业
    本报记者　顾雷
    （一）在重重困难中行进
    甘肃省的水利建设工作正在突飞猛进。甘肃农民用事实向全国人民证明：纵然在极端困难的条件下，也可以战胜干旱，使自然面貌迅速改观。
    甘肃地处高原，多山，平川地区海拔高度均在一千五百公尺以上。省内没有大的湖泊，距离海洋很远，常受北部风沙侵袭，气候异常干燥。每年降雨量平均三百公厘左右，是全国最干旱的地方，历史上多旱灾。
    据比较可靠的统计，从公元1644至1906的二百六十二年间，发生大小旱灾一百一十四次，平均二点三年一次。清朝二百六十年间平均两年一次，国民党统治时期平均一年多一次。素有“三年小旱，五年大旱”之说。翻开甘肃的省志、州志、县志，随处可看到这样的记载：“大旱，民饥，多卖子为奴”；“民饥馑，饿殍载道，民庶遑遑流移者众”；“至夏树皮皆被民食之一空，草根亦食尽，积尸梗道，臭不可近，人相食，甚有碾骨挖尸者”；“禾枯槁，饿死者以万计”……。
    人民为了生存，长期坚持向干旱进行斗争，有许多宝贵的创造。现在，还可以看到秦代和汉代开的水渠。清朝嘉庆年间全省大旱，庄稼全部枯死。一个农民在老鼠洞门口的砂堆上，发现有几棵麦子长的很茂盛，意识到铺砂可以抗旱，创造了铺砂田的办法，一直是抗旱的有效措施。现在经过科学家的鉴定，认为这种砂田渗透率大，蒸发量小，具有抗热、保墒、保温、压碱等作用，产量比同样土地高一至三倍，成熟期早十天到半月。但是，在反动阶级统治的社会里，人民的智慧和创造被扼杀了。1949年甘肃解放时，全省只有水地和水浇地六百二十六万亩，不到总耕地面积的十分之一，每人平均不到五分。许多已有的渠道由于失修，无法保证灌溉，因此年年歉收。广大人民过着“野菜洋芋做搅团，填饱肚子就算饭”的日子。有一首歌谣唱道：“山上和尚头，沟里没水流，年年遭荒旱，人人都发愁！”
    甘肃解放以后，中共甘肃省委为了发展农业生产，首先抓住了干旱这个实际情况。他们认识到：在甘肃，水就是粮食，水就是生命！水，是发展和巩固合作化事业，保证社会主义在农村中获得完全胜利，农民由贫困走向富裕生活的根本环节。因此，几年来坚持不懈地领导全省人民，展开了规模浩大的兴修水利的运动。
    在甘肃，兴修水利的过程实际上是向各种困难斗争的过程。甘肃省所遇到的困难是非常多的。第一，历史上留下的基础太差，想尽快地摆脱干旱威胁，必须把六千多万亩旱田变成水地和水浇地，就是说每人要增加五亩以上，工作量是相当大的。第二，雨水稀少，又多集中在秋季，加之水源情况不清楚，增加了全面规划、综合利用、兴修水利的困难。第三，地形多山、寡树，全省水土流失面积为二十五点五万平方公里，单是黄河流域水土流失面积即达二十一万平方公里，每年流失泥沙四点五亿公方，因之大量土地贫瘠，旱灾不断发生；兴修水利要同水土保持同时进行，任务是艰巨的。第四，这里原是个缺粮省，农民生活较为贫困，加上地区大、人口稀少，每平方公里只有二十五人，兴修水利、水土保持感到人力、物力不足。第五，山区面积大，87％的耕地面积都在山上和塬上，想实现水利化，必须引水上山，工程是艰巨的，技术是复杂的。第六，历史上长期干旱的结果，在群众心理上留下了某些对大自然恐惧的心理，靠天吃饭的习惯势力相当大，增加了兴修水利的阻力。
    甘肃省的水利事业，就是在这种困难条件下用革命精神跃进的。截至去年年底，全省共有水地和水浇地近二千万亩，占耕地面积近30％。八年来增加的水地面积，等于解放前水地面积的三倍多。这些水地的抗旱能力，一般的都在六十天左右；加上其他抗旱措施，基本上可以摆脱一般旱灾的威胁；即使遇到特大的旱灾，绝不会出现历史上曾发生过的惨景了。由于甘肃省大兴水利，使全省由缺粮省变成了余粮省。1949年全省只产粮四十六亿斤，不够吃。到了1956年，粮食产量达到一百零九亿斤，1957年因部分灾害仍产粮一百零一点三亿斤，使甘肃的农民永远摆脱了贫困，不但够吃，还有剩余。
    正由于甘肃省的水利事业，是在很困难的条件下发展起来的，就更具有典范的意义——它使我们有了这样的信念：甘肃省能战胜干旱，全国其他地方也都可以更快地战胜干旱！
  （二）打垮右倾　鼓励革命
    甘肃省在极端干旱的困难条件下，向水利化的目标前进，是对大自然的革命。这个革命，是要掌握自然规律，消除其不利于人民生活的一面，利用其有利的一面为人民造福；这个革命，是要一反过去几千年的历史，争取在短短的时间里，完成前人没有做过、无法做到和不敢想像的事，争取在很短的时间内根本改变干旱的历史。在这个斗争中，起决定作用的是人，是人的劳动。这就不能不反映出人们思想上的斗争。甘肃省的事实证明，欲革大自然的命，首先要在人们思想上进行一次革命，不在思想斗争方面取得胜利，想战胜自然是不可能的。甘肃省水利事业的发展过程，一直贯串了反右倾保守思想的斗争，水利建设实际上也是一次马克思列宁主义思想的大建设。这个斗争的焦点是：人在自然面前屈服呢，还是通过主观努力改变自然面貌呢！
    过去，曾有一部分干部夸大了甘肃的落后面。说到自然条件，总是强调雨量稀少，干旱多灾，温差很大，作物难于生长，地区辽阔，千沟万壑，童山秃岭，交通梗塞，治理面广等困难；提到经济条件，总是强调地薄，民穷，生活贫困，物资缺乏，各种条件很差；讲到社会条件，总是强调民族情况复杂，地广人稀，历史上就落后，群众没有兴修水利的习惯。虽然这些论调中有部分真实，然而在右倾保守者的眼里，许多困难是不可抗御的。他们把甘肃看作是荒凉的沙漠，无法改造或无法很快地改造；甚至有人对这块地方起了厌烦之心。他们静止、孤立地看待客观事物，忽视了人的作用，于是产生了消极、退却的情绪，强调落后，鼓吹落后，散布悲观论调，毫无革命之心，主张一切事情慢慢来，等待大自然的恩赐。这是破坏社会主义建设事业的倾向，这就是1956年以前在甘肃广泛流行的“甘肃落后”论逆流中的主要一股。
    中共甘肃省委，重视了对这种反马克思列宁主义思想逆流的斗争。几年来的事实证明，凡是这种歪风被压下去的时候，各项事业必然跃进；反之，则止步不前。
    1955年冬和1956年春，省委在全省范围内展开了对“甘肃落后”论的批判。在批判过程中，指出“甘肃落后”论是右倾机会主义，它的理论基础是资产阶级的形而上学，它的阶级根源是地主、资产阶级思想在党内的反映；它的存在是危害社会主义建设事业的。同时，教育全省的干部：共产党人要用辩证唯物主义的方法对待客观事物，既看到困难，又要看到有利的因素；共产党人不但要改造社会，而且要改造自然，不管这条道路上有多少艰难；共产党人对待困难的态度应是革命的进攻，而不是畏惧、退缩。
    这一批判持续了五个月，收到了显著的成果。1955年冬天，全省参加农业合作化的农户由9.6％一跃而上升到98.18％，基本完成了农村的社会主义改造。根据农业合作化跃进的形势，省委立即动员全党努力掀起一个生产高潮，主要措施是更抓紧水利建设工作。一方面，指出战胜各种困难，兴修水利的有利条件是：批判了“甘肃落后”论，鼓起了干部的革命劲头；基本实现农业合作化后，解放了农村的生产力；长期干旱，农民具有兴修水利、战胜干旱的强烈的愿望；经过调查全省有地面水六百亿公方，加上雨水和地下水，可以发展水地七千万亩，有充分条件实现水利化；群众有许多行之有效的修水地经验，只要加以总结、推广，就可以事半功倍。另一方面，指示各级党的组织，在开展水利运动时，要“书记动手，亲自挂帅”。这样，1956年水利事业出现了第一个高峰，兴修水地四百三十六万亩，等于解放后几年新修水地的总和。粮食总产量达到一百零九亿斤，比1955年增加二十六亿斤，每亩产量由解放时不到百斤，提高到一百七十五斤；每一个农业人口在征购粮以后平均占有粮食，由1952年的五百零七斤增加到七百四十斤。
    1957年，省委为了在一个大跃进以后巩固已有的成绩，总结经验，积蓄力量，准备另一个大跃进，在某些工作上适当地放慢了脚步，这是正确的。就在这时，某些人的右倾思想又抬头了。他们用这种做法反证过去，认为1956年是“冒进”了，夸大了兴修水利中的某些缺点。当右派分子向党进攻，全面否定社会主义建设成绩的时候，他们在某些问题上有同感，对规定的任务不积极完成。由于右倾思想抬头，1957年兴修水田的任务竟然由原计划的三百万亩减至二百五十万亩，分配不下去，又减到二百万亩还是分配不下去，一直降到一百一十二万亩，最后只完成计划74％。有不少地方是“水流着、天旱着、人喊着”。这一年，粮食总产量只达到一百零一亿斤，主要原因虽是因为受灾，但也是和没有积极兴修水利有关系的。
    1957年全省开展了整风运动，在反右派斗争之后，在农村展开大鸣大放、大辩论，政治战线上和思想战线上取得了新的胜利。特别是党的八届三中全会以后，各地普遍批判了右倾保守思想，马上使水利事业出现了第二个高峰。去年冬天到今年1月20日，四个月的时间，各地充分利用了积极因素，经过主观的努力，已扩大灌溉面积五百一十万亩，等于第一个高峰扩大灌溉面积的一倍多，等于1957年的五倍。从领导干部到群众，牢固地树立了人定胜天的思想，鼓起了革命干劲。这是坚持向右倾保守思想进行斗争的结果，是一场不平凡的斗争，实质上是一场政治思想斗争。甘肃省在这方面取得了决定性的胜利，给实现水利化奠定了坚实的思想基础。
