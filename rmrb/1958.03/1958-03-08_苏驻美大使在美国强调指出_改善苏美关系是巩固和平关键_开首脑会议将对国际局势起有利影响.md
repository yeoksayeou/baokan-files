    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 7th: According to TASS, Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Menshikov, spoke at a banquet held by the National Press Club on the 6th.
    The Soviet Ambassador emphasized that expanding contacts between the United States and the Soviet Union is of great significance, as it is an effective means of establishing an atmosphere of sincerity, trust, and friendship. He expressed regret that relations between the two countries are currently fraught with tension and distrust, which has an adverse effect on the overall international situation. He said that this is particularly dangerous in the context of continuing the arms race, while creating new weapons of destruction, and accumulating atomic and hydrogen bombs.
    The Soviet Ambassador stressed that, on the other hand, the normalization of Soviet-US relations would also help ease international tensions. Menshikov said that the Soviet people and the Soviet government are deeply convinced that the key to consolidating peace and the correct path to easing international tensions should be sought in the nature of Soviet-US relations. He said that this does not mean that we disregard the interests of other countries or intend to solve problems in place of other countries. He continued, we are merely advocating that the forces of the United States and the Soviet Union should be united to fight for the consolidation of peace, which is in the interests of all countries, large and small. The Soviet Ambassador said that there are objective conditions for improving Soviet-US relations, because there are no irreconcilable contradictions between them, and there are no territorial ambitions. He stressed that the principles of peaceful coexistence recently endorsed by the United Nations, the expansion of Soviet-US trade and cultural ties, and the conclusion of a Soviet-US treaty of friendship can serve as the basis for establishing friendly Soviet-US relations.
    The Ambassador emphasized the great significance of a summit meeting for easing international tensions. He said that only a meeting of heads of government can discuss the most important and pressing international issues and reach mutually acceptable agreements. The very fact of holding such a meeting will have a favorable impact on the international situation. It shows the people of the world that heads of government are genuinely committed to reaching agreements, willing to ease dangerous tensions, and to resolve pressing issues through negotiations.

    苏驻美大使在美国强调指出
    改善苏美关系是巩固和平关键
    开首脑会议将对国际局势起有利影响
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿讯：苏联驻美国大使缅希科夫6日在全国新闻俱乐部的宴会上讲了话。
    苏联大使强调指出，扩大美国同苏联之间的接触具有巨大意义，这是建立真诚、信任和友好局势的有效手段。他表示遗憾的是，目前两国之间的关系充满了紧张和不信任，这对整个国际局势产生不良影响。他说，在继续军备竞赛、同时制造新的毁灭性武器、积累原子弹和氢弹的情况下，这就具有特别危险的性质。
    苏联大使强调说，另一方面苏美关系的正常化也有助于国际紧张局势的缓和。缅希科夫说，苏联人民和苏联政府深信，巩固和平的关键和缓和国际紧张局势的正确途径应当在苏美关系的性质中去寻找。他说，这并不是说我们无视其他国家的利益或者打算代替其他国家解决问题。他接着说，我们只不过是主张联合美国和苏联的力量为巩固和平而斗争，这是符合一切大小国家的利益的。苏联大使说，改善苏美关系是具有客观条件的，因为它们之间不存在不能解决的矛盾，没有任何领土野心。他强调说，不久前联合国所赞同的和平共处原则、扩大苏美贸易和文化联系以及缔结苏美友好条约可以成为建立苏美友好关系的基础。
    大使着重指出最高级会议对于缓和国际紧张局势的重大意义。他说，只有各国政府首脑会议才可能讨论最重要和最迫切的国际问题和达成互相可以接受的协议。召开这个会议的事实本身将对国际局势起有利的影响。它向全世界人民表明，各国政府首脑真正致力于达成协议，愿意缓和危险的紧张局势和通过谈判解决迫切的问题。
