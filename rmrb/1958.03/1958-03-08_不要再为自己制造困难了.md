    Stop Creating Difficulties for Yourself
    Shen Xisheng, Nantong City Tax Bureau, Jiangsu Province

    We have a comrade here who is only twenty-eight years old this year, but he has already been receiving state subsidies for multiple children since his second year of work—1954—because he already had three children. By the first half of 1955, he had another child. In the 1956 wage reform, he was promoted one grade, and his salary increased to 41 yuan, totaling 51 yuan with the subsidy. At that time, society was already calling on people to practice contraception and birth control, but he believed that since he had many children, the leadership would take care of him anyway. By the end of 1956, his fifth child was born. After the child was born, he immediately made new subsidy requests to the leadership.

    Precisely because he has always had the idea of relying on the state to help him solve difficulties, he has not yet taken effective measures for contraception and birth control. Now I hear that his wife is pregnant with their sixth child. Well, soon he will reach out to the state again to ask for increased subsidies. I really don't understand why he doesn't consider how to manage his life? He doesn't seem to think that always relying on the public and not actively overcoming difficulties himself is something to be ashamed of.

    不要再为自己制造困难了
    江苏省南通市税务局　沈希圣
    我们这里有一位同志，今年才不过二十八岁，可是他却早已从参加工作的第二年——1954年起，开始领取国家的多子女补助费了，因为他已经有了三个孩子。到了1955年上半年，他又多了一个孩子。在1956年工资改革中，他被提升了一级，工资升为四十一元，连补助共五十一元。这时社会上早已号召人们避孕节育了，可是他认为子女多了，反正领导上会照顾的。到了1956年年底，第五个孩子又出世了。孩子生下来以后，他立即向领导上又提出了新的补助要求了。
    正因为他一直有依赖国家帮助来解决困难的思想，所以至今还没有采取有效措施来进行避孕节育，现在听说他的爱人又怀了第六个小孩子了。那末，不久他又要向国家伸手要增加补助了。我真不懂，他为什么不考虑怎样安排生活？他好像并不觉得永远依赖公家自己不积极克服困难，是并不光彩的事。
