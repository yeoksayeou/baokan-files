    Resignation and Progress
    ——Concluding Remarks on "Should One Resign to Return Home and Engage in Housework?"
    On February 9th, the supplement published Comrade Qian Miaoying's letter. Consequently, the question of "Should one resign to return home and engage in housework?" aroused widespread concern among readers. Over the past month, we have received nearly a thousand letters participating in the discussion. The vast majority of readers disagreed with Comrade Qian Miaoying's view, believing that it is correct to allow some female comrades who are not suitable for cadre positions to resign and return home. A few people had difficulty understanding some issues, and a few individuals exhibited resistance. Here, we will only express some opinions on the issues raised in the discussion as the conclusion to this discussion.
    Why exactly should some female cadres be allowed to resign and return home to engage in housework? As everyone knows, the new construction tasks facing our people are so significant and arduous that in order to better complete such tasks, we must tighten institutions, reduce personnel, and strengthen the labor front with revolutionary spirit. To meet the needs of revolutionary struggles and construction, the Party and the state rapidly established a large number of cadre teams, and also cultivated and promoted a large number of female cadres. It is precisely by relying on these forces that significant achievements have been made in various tasks. However, because the cadre teams expanded so quickly, a minority of them do not possess the qualifications of cadres. Some female comrades either have low educational levels or weak bodies and cannot adapt to the needs of the work; or they have many children and heavy household burdens and cannot effectively exert the due role of cadres. Although they wholeheartedly want to do their jobs well, their ability falls short of their aspirations. In particular, some female comrades with many children often cannot attend to everything and often affect their work. Some female comrades go to work, sending several children to nurseries, resulting in the state having to spend a lot of money on the children each month. For these comrades, how can they fully play an active role in the cause of socialist construction? Is it better to resign and engage in housework, or to continue to stay in their jobs? Considering the overall interests of the country, it is better to resign and return home to engage in housework.
    Of course, in saying this, we are by no means advocating that all female cadres return to their families. The majority of people should continue to stay in their posts, and only a minority should resign. Therefore, it cannot be simplified, and different situations should be treated differently. Some readers suggested: "Just let those who don't do well at work go home!" This is an approach that does not analyze the specific situation.
    Some people, upon hearing about resigning and returning home to engage in housework, have a large number of questions they cannot understand, and all sorts of concerns arise.
    "Doesn't this mean I'm breaking away from the revolution?" They confuse the social division of labor with revolution. In fact, "resigning" from a job does not mean a decline in revolutionary will. Whether a person is revolutionary or not is mainly determined by whether he or she plays a promoting or hindering role in social development, and not by his or her occupation. If his or her actions are beneficial to the cause of socialist construction and consciously serve socialism, then no matter what labor he or she engages in, and regardless of his or her occupation, he or she is a revolutionary and will always be moving forward. Some people also worry whether they can join the Party after resigning. This worry is naturally superfluous. For a person with a high degree of communist consciousness, he or she can become a staunch communist fighter in any position.
    "Female cadres are losing favor!" This is another erroneous argument. Our Party has always paid attention to selecting outstanding working-class and peasant women or intellectual women who have close ties with the working-class and peasant masses to undertake various tasks. In the future, we will continue to implement the policy of patiently cultivating, boldly using, and correctly promoting female cadres. Some people ask, why did we advocate and mobilize women to participate in work in the past, and now we are mobilizing some female cadres to engage in housework? These are two different things. Advocating for women to participate in work is an unchanging principle, and the current mobilization of some female cadres to resign is a specific approach determined based on specific circumstances. We often say that cadres are the servants of the people, which requires them not only to come from the masses of the people, but also to be able to return to the masses of the people at any time; it requires them to leave their production labor posts and come to the organs to adapt to the needs of the revolution, and when it is necessary to tighten state organs and strengthen the labor front, they can happily return to labor. Therefore, the idea of "losing favor" is an expression of calculating personal gains and losses and disregarding overall interests.
    "Housework is not glorious." This is an even more erroneous view. In the eyes of a revolutionary, any labor that is beneficial to the cause of socialist construction is glorious. In our country, with the development of social productive forces and the changes in the socio-economic system, the family has become the cornerstone of the socialist cause, and housework plays a significant role in the socialist cause. A housewife, if she can cultivate her children into people with lofty communist ideals, and if she can manage her household well according to the spirit of diligence and frugality, allowing her spouse to work happily, then she has made a significant contribution to society. How can it be said that engaging in such meaningful labor is not glorious?
    "Without economic independence, wouldn't one become a parasite?" In our country, the economic foundation of the family is the socialist public ownership of the means of production, not private ownership; the relationship between family members is one of equality, harmony, mutual assistance and cooperation, not male superiority over female inferiority, with women in a position of dependence on men. Therefore, the labor achievements of family members also include the achievements of housework.
    "Resigning and returning home, one is not accustomed to it in all aspects." Yes, this is true. But this unfamiliarity is only temporary. Through learning and practice, one will become familiar with it.
    We hope that female comrades who resign and return home will continue to strengthen their revolutionary will, carry forward their revolutionary vigor, be good at using and arranging time, persist in political current affairs, theory and cultural learning, improve their ability to manage housework, actively participate in various social activities, play a backbone role among the masses, and strive to become "five-good" activists.

### 退职和进步——“该不该退职回家从事家务劳动”的结束语

专栏：大家讨论

    退职和进步
    ——“该不该退职回家从事家务劳动”的结束语
    2月9日，副刊上发表了钱妙英同志的来信。于是，“该不该退职回家从事家务劳动”的问题，引起了广大读者的关心。一个月来，我们收到了近千封参加讨论的信。绝大多数读者都不同意钱妙英的看法，他们认为让一部分不适合当干部的女同志退职回家的作法是正确的。也有少数人对一些问题想不通，个别人存在抵触情绪。在这里，我们仅就讨论中提出的若干问题发表些意见，作为这场讨论的结束语。
    究竟为什么要让一部分女干部退职回家从事家务劳动呢？大家都知道，摆在我国人民面前的新的建设任务是这样重大而艰巨，为了更好地完成这样的任务，非得用革命精神紧缩机构、减少人员，加强劳动战线不可。适应革命斗争和建设事业的需要，党和国家迅速地建立了大批的干部队伍，同样也培养和提拔了大批的女干部。正是依靠这批力量，各项工作才取得了重大的成绩。但是，因为干部队伍扩大得很快，其中有少数人是不具备干部条件的。有些女同志或者是文化水平低、身体弱，不能适应工作的需要；或者是子女多、家务重，不能很好地发挥干部应有的作用。她们虽然满心想把工作做好，但是力不从心。特别是一些孩子多的女同志，常会顾了东顾不了西，常常影响工作。有些女同志本人去工作，把几个孩子送进托儿所，结果国家每月在孩子身上要支出很多钱。对于这些同志说来，怎样才能使她们在社会主义建设事业中充分发挥积极作用呢？是退职从事家务劳动好呢？还是继续留在工作岗位上好呢？从国家的整体利益考虑，还是退职回家从事家务劳动好。
    当然，这样说，绝不是要一律地动员女干部回到家庭中去。大多数人要继续留在岗位上，应该退职的人只是少数。因此，不能简单化，要根据不同情况，分别对待。有的读者提出：“干脆让那些工作不好的人都回家！”这是一种不分析具体情况的作法。
    有些人一听说退职回家从事家务劳动，就有一大堆想不通的问题，种种顾虑全来了。
    “这岂不是让我脱离革命吗？”她们把社会的劳动分工和革命混淆起来了。其实，“退”职，并不是革命意志的衰退。一个人是不是革命，主要决定于他对社会的发展起着促进作用，还是起着阻碍作用，而不决定他的职业。如果他的行动对社会主义建设事业是有利的，是自觉地为社会主义服务的，那么不管他从事什么劳动，他的职业如何，他都是革命者，永远是前进的。有的人还顾虑退职以后是不是能够入党呢？这种顾虑自然是多余的。对于一个具有高度共产主义觉悟的人来说，不管他在任何岗位上，他都能够成为坚强的共产主义战士。
    “女干部吃不开了！”这又是一种错误论调。我们党从来都是注意选拔优秀的工农妇女或是和工农群众有密切联系的知识妇女担负各项工作的。今后，还将永远贯彻耐心培养、放手使用和正确提拔妇女干部的方针。有人问，为什么过去提倡和动员妇女参加工作，现在又动员一部分女干部从事家务劳动呢？这是两回事情。提倡妇女参加工作，这个原则是不变的，现在动员一部分女干部退职是根据具体情况确定的具体作法。我们常说，干部是人民的勤务员，这就是要求他们不仅从人民群众中来，而且在任何时候都能够回到人民群众中去；要求他们适应革命的需要脱离生产劳动岗位到机关中来，在需要紧缩国家机关加强劳动战线的时候，又能欣然回到劳动中去。因此，“吃不开”的想法，是计较个人得失，不顾整体利益的表现。
    “家务劳动不光荣。”这更是错误的看法。在一个革命者看来，凡是对社会主义建设事业有益的劳动，都是光荣的。在我国，随着社会生产力的发展和社会经济制度的改变，家庭已经成为社会主义事业的基石，家务劳动对社会主义事业起着重大作用。一个家庭主妇，如果能把自己的孩子培养成具有崇高共产主义理想的人，如果能根据勤俭持家的精神管好家务，使爱人愉快地工作，那么她就对社会作出了重大的贡献。从事这种有意义的劳动，怎能说是不光荣呢？
    “经济不能独立，不是变成寄生虫了吗？”我们国家里，家庭的经济基础是生产资料的社会主义公有制，而不是私有制；家庭成员之间的关系是平等和睦，互助合作的关系，而不是男尊女卑，妇女处于依赖男子的地位。因此，在家庭成员的劳动成果中，也包含着家务劳动的成绩。
    “退职回家，各方面都不习惯。”是的，这一条是说对了。但，这不习惯，也只是暂时的。经过学习和锻炼就会熟悉起来了。
    我们希望退职回家的女同志要继续坚定革命意志，发扬革命朝气，善于利用和安排时间，坚持政治时事、理论和文化学习，提高操持家务的能力，积极参加各项社会活动，在群众中发挥骨干作用，争取成为“五好”积极分子。
