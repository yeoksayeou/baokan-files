Technical Innovations Emerge Endlessly
Hunan Masses Creatively Produce New Farm Tools and Transportation Equipment

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the New Hunan Daily, in the great leap forward of agricultural production, many areas of Hunan have extensively improved old-fashioned farm tools and created new ones, as well as improved old-fashioned transportation tools.
    Teng Shusheng and others in the Fenghuang Tuojiang Township of Yueyang County, after more than twenty modifications, created a wooden double-share plow. It is light and flexible, capable of plowing both large and small paddy fields, dry land, ridge fields, and terraced fields, with an efficiency more than twice that of the old plows. The Baoquan Cooperative in Pingjiang created a single-roller, double-column, multi-tooth soil pulverizing harrow, with an efficiency one time greater than the old harrow. The Wangping Cooperative in Pingjiang created a double-wheeled row crop cultivator. Guo Maocai of the Wangcheng Dazhong Farm Tool Repair Station created a double-roller cultivator, which is very suitable for densely planted fields and doubles the efficiency of the single-roller cultivator. Song Gaotang, a poor peasant from the Sixth Cooperative of the Daweixi Township in Xupu, and Liu Shichang, director of the Tao Yuan Cha Anpu Timber Cooperative, both successfully created automatic waterwheels. In addition, there are also the creation and improvement of four-purpose seeders, three-purpose cutters, hand-cranked chaff cutters, automatic windmills, wind-powered waterwheels, wooden water pumps, disc harrows, single-roller rubbing harrows, and other farm tools..., truly a blossoming of a hundred flowers, a kaleidoscope of colors, greatly welcomed by the masses.
    The most and fastest creations by various places in conjunction with the manure accumulation movement are transportation tools. The wheelbarrow is being extensively promoted. The Paixing Cooperative of Taizimiao Township in Hanshou County, full of drive and initiative, basically eliminated shoulder carrying in just half a month, realizing the motorization of manure transportation. Hengshan County worked hard for half a month, manufacturing 60,000 vehicles. Adding in the existing wheelbarrows of the peasants, they achieved an average of one vehicle per household, realizing vehicle ownership throughout the county. Zhao Zhongyan, director of the Shuangxi Cooperative in Linli, pondered day and night, repeatedly designing and experimenting with his own granary boards, and finally created a three-wheeled ox-drawn flatbed cart that could travel on high mountain passes, sharp turns, and steep slopes. In the previous stage of improving low-yielding fields in the Shashi Township of Shaodong, it cost sixty workdays per mu. Recently, with the mass manufacture of flatbed carts, efficiency has increased three to six times, and surplus labor can be extracted to engage in more side occupations. In the Yuchi and Banqiao Townships of Changning, various manure transporting vehicles are even more like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each displaying their own unique abilities. There are more than ten types of vehicles, including single-wheeled, double-wheeled, three-wheeled, and four-wheeled human-powered carts, ox-drawn carts, cranes, pulleys, boat-shaped carts, and wooden rail carts. Some vehicles have an efficiency twenty times higher than manual carrying. The Zhuohu Cooperative of Yongshun created a three-wheeled mobile funnel cart, small and exquisite, increasing efficiency by six times. The township and cooperative cadres of the Tongluopo Cooperative in the suburban area of Sangzhi County tried to create a sliding flat car. The work team stationed in the Zeyuan Cooperative of Changde County tested earth carts with wooden rails. Some cooperatives in Xinhua, Huayuan, Hengnan, Anren, Anhua, Jiahe, and other places also manufactured similar types of earth carts, all greatly improving efficiency. According to estimates, in the three transportation tasks of manure accumulation, grain transportation, and pig delivery alone, the average laborer would have to carry for about a hundred days. If various earth carts are used, efficiency can be increased by about two times, and each laborer would only bear thirty days. The entire province can save seven to eight hundred million labor days.
    In accordance with the use of vehicles, many areas have launched a high tide of shock repairs to rural roads. The farmers of Cenjiangdu Township in Daoxian County repaired 30 simple roads in three days and three nights, totaling ninety li in length, saving the entire township 200,000 labor days a year. Lengshuitan Township in Lingling built ninety li of highways and two hundred and eighteen li of small roads in one week. Nineteen cooperatives have already connected every cooperative with automobiles and every team with ox carts, forming a rural transportation network. Farmers in Qingshan Township in Qidong chiseled stones and filled pits, turning narrow mountain paths into wide vehicle roads. Zhongshankou Cooperative in Hanshou straightened curved roads, widened narrow roads, and leveled sloping roads. Some townships and cooperatives in Dong'an, Ling County, Yongshun, Hengnan, and other places are also stepping up road repairs.
    Currently, leaders at all levels in various places are boldly mobilizing the masses to reform tools, improve farming techniques, improve labor management, and increase labor efficiency to promote spring plowing production. Sparks of fire will soon ignite into a prairie fire of technological revolution.

    技术革新层出不穷
    湖南群众大量创制新农具和运输工具
    本报讯　据新湖南报报道：在农业生产大跃进中，湖南许多地区大量改良旧式农具，创造新式农具，改良旧式交通运输工具。
    岳阳县凤凰沱江镇滕树生等经过二十多次修改，制成了木质双铧犁，它轻便灵活，能犁大小水田、旱田、垅田、梯田，工效比旧犁高两倍以上。平江保全社创制了单滚双柱多齿碎土耙，工效比旧耙高一倍。平江汪坪社创制了双轮车叶中耕器。望城大众农具修配站虢茂才创制双滚式中耕器，很适用于密植田，工效又比单滚式中耕器提高了一倍。溆浦大渭溪乡第六社贫农宋高堂和桃源茶庵铺木业社主任刘世长都创制自动水车成功。此外，各地还有四用播种机、三用创切机、手摇铡草机、自动风车、风力水车、木质水泵、圆盘耙、单滚蹂耙等等农具的创制和改进……，真是百花齐放、五彩缤纷，大受群众欢迎。
    各地结合积肥运动创造得最多最快的是交通运输工具。独轮土车正在大量推广，汉寿太子庙乡排形社充满干劲和钻劲，只半个月就基本上消灭肩挑人背，实现了运肥车子化。衡山县苦干半个月，造车六万辆，加上农民原有土车，达到平均每户农民有一辆车，实现全县车子化。临澧双溪社主任赵忠炎日夜苦思，用自己的仓板反复设计试验，终于制成了一种在高山隘道，急弯陡坡都能行走的牛拉三轮板车。邵东砂石乡前段改良低产田，每亩要花六十个工，最近大量制造土板车，工效提高了三至六倍，还能抽出剩余劳力多搞副业。在常宁渔池、板桥两乡，各种运肥车辆更如八仙飘海，各显神通，共有独轮、双轮、三轮、四轮等人拉车，牛拉车、吊车、滑车、船形车、木轨车等十余种，有的车子工效比人力挑运高二十倍。永顺卓湖社制成三轮活动漏斗车，小巧玲珑，工效提高了六倍。桑植城郊乡铜锣坡社的乡社干部试创了滑行平车，常德县泽远社驻社工作组试验了垫木轨土车，新化、花垣、衡南、安仁、安化、嘉禾等地有些社也制造了类似各种土车，都大大提高了工效。据估算，全省仅积肥、运粮、送猪三项运输，平均每个劳力挑运要一百来天，如果用各种土车运，可提高工效两倍左右，每个劳力只负担三十来天，全省即可节省七—八亿个劳动日。
    与使用车子相适应，许多地区掀起了突击抢修乡村道路的高潮。道县岑江渡乡农民三天三夜就修好了三十条简易公路，共长九十华里，全乡一年能节省二十万个劳动日。零陵冷水滩乡一星期修成了九十里大马路、二百一十八里小马路，十九个社已经社社通汽车、队队通牛车，形成了乡村交通网。祁东青山乡农民凿石填坑，把羊肠小道变成宽阔车路。汉寿中山口社将弯路裁直、狭路加宽、坡路改平。东安、酃县、永顺、衡南等地有些乡社都在加紧修路。
    当前各地各级领导正在放手发动群众改革工具，改良耕作技术，改善劳动管理，提高劳动工效，推动春耕生产。星星点点的火花，行将燃成燎原的技术革命的烈火。
