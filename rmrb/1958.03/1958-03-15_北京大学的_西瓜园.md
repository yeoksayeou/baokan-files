Peking University's "Watermelon Patch"

    After the "Double-Anti" movement unfolded at Peking University, more than 88,000 big-character posters were put up in the first few hours of the afternoon. Who could read so many big-character posters? The Physics Department took the lead in opening a big-character poster selection – the "Watermelon Patch."

    The "Watermelon Patch" promptly selected and concentrated the "watermelons" (high-quality big-character posters) from the mass big-character posters. In this way, in addition to playing the role of higher-quality big-character posters, it can also help everyone to deeply expose and think about some more fundamental issues in their work. The Peking University Party Committee promptly affirmed and promoted this method from the masses. Currently, all departments and many grades in the school have opened "Watermelon Patches."

    北京大学的“西瓜园”
    “双反”运动在北京大学展开后，第一天下午几小时内就贴出了大字报八万八千多张。这么多的大字报，谁能看得了呢？物理系首先开辟了大字报选辑——“西瓜园”。
    “西瓜园”及时地把群众大字报中的“西瓜”（质量较高的大字报）挑选、集中起来。这样除了能起比大字报质量的作用外，还能帮助大家去深入揭发和思考工作中的一些比较带有根本性的问题。北大党委会及时肯定并推广了这个来自群众的办法。目前全校各系和不少年级都开辟了“西瓜园”。（近山）（附图片）
