To Run Veteran Cadre Classes Well, Two Ideological Problems Must Be Solved
Zu Nian

"Don't be empty-headed politicians." Many worker and peasant cadres urgently request to improve their professional knowledge. Holding special veteran cadre classes in universities is one of the important ways to cultivate these worker and peasant cadres to be both red and expert in a planned and large-scale manner. In recent years, the administrative leaders and teachers of many universities have done a lot of work in this regard, but the political significance of cultivating worker-class intellectuals is not yet deeply understood by the administrative leaders and teachers of some schools. Some people use the excuse that training veteran worker and peasant cadres is too troublesome, and they lack sufficient attention to the students' studies, understand little about their learning situation, and are not active enough in solving their learning difficulties. Some teachers even lack deep feelings for worker and peasant cadres, thinking that their level is low. They show impatience in their teaching attitude, and there is a rush in the teaching methods, only teaching and not caring about learning, so that the difficulties of worker and peasant students in learning are not solved in time.

To run veteran cadre special classes well, the school itself must solve these problems ideologically. It is necessary to realize that in the great leap forward of socialist construction in our country, the industrial and agricultural fronts urgently need a group of well-trained veteran cadres to strengthen leadership. Cultivating these veteran cadres to have a certain level of scientific and technological knowledge is a major political task in higher education. Therefore, the administrative leaders and teachers of the school must have infinite care and love for the students who are veteran cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds, and constantly improve teaching methods and strengthen extracurricular tutoring according to their characteristics, so as to achieve better teaching results.

In addition, veteran cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds must also solve some ideological problems. When the leadership transfers some veteran cadres to special university classes to study, on the one hand, they have the desire to study, and on the other hand, they have different ideological concerns. Some people think that they are already in their thirties or forties, and their education level is low. It is very difficult to study physics, chemistry, geometry, and algebra in college. This view is one-sided. It is a fact that veteran cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds have low education and a poor foundation, but bowing their heads in the face of difficulties will only lead to defeat. The eighty veteran cadres studying at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and the Beijing Institute of Technology, who are generally required to complete the courses that young students complete in five or six years in two and a half or one and a half years, it would not be true to say that they have no difficulties. It is precisely because they are brave enough to overcome difficulties that they have achieved very good results. Veteran cadres studying in special classes in universities must not only see their shortcomings, such as low education, poor foundation, and weak memory, but also see their strengths, such as rich practical experience, strong understanding, and revolutionary enthusiasm. Only by looking at themselves in this comprehensive way can they strengthen their confidence and clarify the direction of their efforts. In their studies, as long as they study diligently and ask questions with the attitude of a primary school student, study hard, and humbly ask others for advice if they don't understand, over time, veteran cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds with lower education can also break through the scientific and technological fortress. There is no doubt about this.

    办好老干部班要解决两个思想
    祖年
    “不作空头政治家”，许多工农干部都迫切要求提高学习业务知识。在高等学校里举办老干部特别班，是有计划地大量地培养这些工农干部又红又专的重要办法之一。几年来，许多高等学校行政领导和教师，在这方面做了许多工作，但是对于培养工人阶级知识分子的政治意义，有些学校的行政领导和教师们，还认识得不深刻。有的人以培养工农老干部太麻烦为借口，对这些学生的学习缺乏足够重视，对他们的学习情况了解的少，主动地解决他们学习上的困难也不够；甚至有部分教师对工农干部缺乏深厚的感情，认为他们水平低，在教学态度上表现不耐烦，在教学方法上存在着硬赶进度，只管教不管学，致使工农学生在学习上的困难得不到及时解决。
    要办好老干部特别班，学校本身必须要从思想上解决这些问题。要认识到我们的国家，在社会主义建设的跃进中，工农业战线上急需要有一批久经锻炼的老干部来加强领导。培养这些老干部使他们有一定的科学技术水平，这是高等教育中的一项重大的政治任务。因此，学校的行政领导和教师，对工农出身老干部的学生要无限关怀和爱护，针对他们的特点，不断地改进教学方法，加强课外辅导，这样才能取得较好的教学成果。
    另外，工农出身的老干部，也要解决一些思想上的问题。有些老干部当领导上调他到高等学校特别班去学习的时候，他一方面有学习的要求，另方面则有不同的思想顾虑。有的人认为，自己已经三四十岁的人啦，文化又低，进大学学习物理、化学、几何、代数很困难。这种看法是片面的。工农出身的老干部，文化低，基础差，这是事实，但是在困难面前低头，就只有打败仗。 在北京航空学院和工业学院学习的八十名老干部，以两年半或一年半的时间，大体上要完成青年学生用五、六年所完成的课程，要说他们没有困难，那不是事实，就是因为他们勇于克服困难，他们已取得了很好的成绩。在高等学校特别班学习的老干部，既要看到自己不足的地方，如文化低、基础差、记忆较弱等，但是，又要看到自己的长处，如实际经验丰富，理解能力强，而又具有革命的干劲。这样来全面地看自己，才能坚定信心和明确努力方向。在学习中，只要以做一个小学生的态度勤学多问，刻苦钻研，不懂就虚心请教别人，长此下去，文化较低的工农出身的老干部，也能攻破科学技术堡垒，这是不用怀疑的。
