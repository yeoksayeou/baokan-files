　　Not Thinking About Tomorrow
　　In order to alleviate the urgent economic recession, Washington officials and members of Congress have been in a frenzy these days drafting so-called anti-recession plans. Before Eisenhower's public works plan of over $170 million could even be discussed, Democratic congressmen proposed an anti-recession plan to build housing worth $1.85 billion, followed by a plan to increase highway construction by $5.5 billion... It's as if the U.S. treasury is a bottomless pit, available for these great gentlemen to squander at will.
　　However, amidst the noisy clamor in Washington to increase government spending, Budget Director Brundage quietly slipped away. Then, Senator Byrd, Chairman of the Finance Committee, finally had to come out and remind everyone that such spending would be enough to create an alarming deficit of $15 billion.
　　But Washington officials and members of Congress seemed not to have heard this warning, and they were simply busy continuing to draft their respective anti-recession plans. This situation shows that Washington politicians have been forced by the economic recession to only think about today, and not about tomorrow.

    顾不得明天
    为了解救经济萎缩的燃眉之急，这些日子以来华盛顿的官员和议员全都陷入了起草所谓反衰退计划的狂热中。艾森豪威尔的一亿七千多万美元的公共工程计划还没有来得及讨论，民主党议员就又提出了十八亿五千万美元兴建房屋的反衰退方案，接着又是一个增加五十五亿美元修筑公路的方案……仿佛美国的国库是一个无底洞，可以无限制地供这些大人先生们任意挥霍似的。
    但是，在华盛顿这种增加政府开支的闹哄哄的叫嚷声中，预算局长布伦戴奇却偷偷地溜掉了。接着参议院财政委员会主席贝德终于不得不出来提醒大家，这样的花费已经足以使预算出现一百五十亿美元的惊人赤字。
    但是华盛顿的官员和议员们似乎没有听到这种警告似的，他们只是一味在继续忙碌地起草他们各自的反衰退计划。这种情形说明，华盛顿的政客们已被经济衰退逼得只能顾得今天，而顾不得明天了。
