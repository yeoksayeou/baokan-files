Reader's Letter: Organizing Family Members to Engage in Sideline Production

Around the high tide of 1956, the leaders of our factory went deep into the dormitories of the workers' families many times to understand the living conditions of the workers and provide relief to households in difficulty in a timely manner. The workers who received relief generally felt the warmth and care of the Party and the government for them, and many shed tears of gratitude.

However, relief can only temporarily solve some problems and cannot fundamentally solve the daily life problems of workers. After investigation, we found that some workers have difficulties in life, mainly because their wages are not low, but because their family burden is heavy and the number of people they directly support is too large. For example, Gu Yanyun, the warehouse keeper of our factory's clinic, earns 48.5 yuan a month. Judging from his position, his salary is not low, but he supports the lives of three students, three children, and a housewife. Including himself, the average monthly living expenses per person are only six yuan, so he often asks for relief. Another example is Yang Guoxiang, the head of our factory's sales department, whose salary is 108 yuan, and there are four middle school students, two primary school students, two children, and a housewife in his family. Once, because the housewife was sick, the trade union provided relief. Some comrades said, "He earns more than 100 yuan and still needs relief. What should we do?" Yang Guoxiang also felt very embarrassed, but there was no other way.

At present, some workers have difficulties in life due to heavy family burdens, which causes ideological anxiety, affects production, and also affects family unity. Some housewives, in addition to doing housework, have nothing to do, chat with neighbors, spread gossip, cause trouble, fight and curse, and cause disunity.

The above situation shows that it is necessary to organize family members of workers to engage in household sideline production. Some family members are very eager to participate in labor. Although housewives, the old, the weak, the sick, the disabled, and students cannot participate in labor all day long, our investigation proves that the available labor force is also considerable.

We conducted an investigation in a collective family dormitory of our factory at No. 229 Qixian Street, Tiexi District, Shenyang. There are a total of 70 workers, but the total number of family members living with them is 305. Among the family members, there are 152 people who can work (including 12 pure idle laborers). Among them, there are 39 male laborers and 113 female laborers. Among the 70 housewives, except for 13 who cannot provide labor due to various reasons or housework, they can do an average of four hours of sideline production labor per day. In addition to going to school and reviewing, students can also work for two hours a day. This is a relatively conservative calculation method. According to this calculation standard, the family members of 70 workers can provide 458 hours of labor per day (equivalent to 57 working days). In other words, for every 100 workers, their family members can provide 80 laborers per day to engage in sideline production.

Last spring, we organized some family members to peel mica sheets for the local state-owned Shenyang Insulating Material Factory. A total of 315 family members participated. They learned while producing, some only worked for one or two months, or three or four months, and the maximum was seven or eight months. Under such circumstances, the total income from February to September last year was more than 7,100 yuan. Meng Xianrong, a family member, earned 198 yuan alone. Yang Guoxiang's daughter, Yang Xiang, used her spare time after school to peel mica sheets. From March to September, she earned a total of 65.7 yuan, which solved her tuition, clothing, and pocket money. This increased the income of the workers, improved their living conditions, saved relief funds for the country, eliminated the idea of a few workers simply relying on state relief, strengthened the concept of labor, and improved their ideological understanding in labor, establishing a good atmosphere of unity and mutual assistance.

In short, organizing family members of workers to engage in sideline labor production is a good way to fundamentally solve the difficulties in the family life of workers. Regarding the objects of labor, in addition to requiring the state to consider the overall situation, the following items are initially expected to be available for reference:

\tI. Embroidery, lace, hairnets, various wire nets (basketball and volleyball nets, table tennis nets, fishing nets, net baskets, etc.), sweaters, woolen trousers, woolen headscarves, woolen aprons, woolen scarves, and handmade knitted products (such as yarn schoolbags, gloves, yarn travel bags) and handmade silk thread products (such as various silk thread sets).

\tII. Industrial supplies: such as peeling mica sheets, making asbestos ropes, hemp ropes, paper ropes, thread ropes, making various packaging paper boxes, paper bags, and some labor protection supplies.

\tIII. Children's clothing (clothing, trousers, shoes, hats, etc.), cloth toys, wooden toys, fur toys, etc.

\tIV. Some small-scale scattered repairs and washing work.

\tV. Raising quails, rabbits, chickens, ducks, pigs, etc.

The above are relatively easy indoor labor under the current circumstances. Some family members can also participate in small-scale light transportation, short-distance transportation (such as delivering goods, rice, vegetables, coal, or newspapers for cooperatives or department stores), participate in the packaging of factory commodities, participate in social service industries, or clean street sanitation in sections.

In order to organize family members of workers to engage in sideline labor in a guided manner, I would like to make the following suggestions to the relevant departments:

\tI. It is suggested that the State Planning Commission forward to the planning commissions of various provinces and cities to include this work in the municipal plans when arranging the Second Five-Year Plan.

\tII. It is suggested that the State Statistical Bureau forward to the statistical bureaus of various provinces and cities to conduct a survey and statistics on the labor capacity of workers' family members in various regions across the country, forward them to relevant units for reference, and report them regularly in the future so that they are well informed.

\tIII. It is suggested that the Ministry of Labor take this factor into consideration when carrying out labor allocation during the Second Five-Year Plan period, and when necessary, use it as a target for internal scheduling in urban areas, and consciously promote the further reduction of the urban population.

\tIV. It is suggested that the Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives establish relevant institutions to conduct pilot projects and gradually promote this work.

\tV. It is suggested that the people's committees of various provinces, cities, and districts organize technicians and skilled workers in the existing handicraft cooperatives and sewing production cooperatives to participate in the family labor production service group of the cooperative to provide technical guidance for family labor. If there are still some workers engaged in simple labor in the current handicraft production cooperatives, they should be mobilized to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor to reduce the urban population.

\tVI. It is suggested that the First Ministry of Machine Building consider abolishing the mica peeling workshops of various motor factories and hand them over to the family members of workers to peel. This can save factory space and reduce some wages, additional wages, and other related additional expenses, which can reduce the burden of welfare undertakings and reduce costs.

### 组织家属搞副业

    组织家属搞副业
    在1956年高潮前后，我们厂的领导干部多次深入职工家属宿舍，了解职工生活情况，发现困难户及时给予救济。受救济的职工普遍感到党和政府对他们的温暖和关怀，不少人流下了感激的眼泪。
    但是，救济只能暂时解决一些问题，而不能根本解决职工的日常生活中的问题。经过调查，我们发现有些职工生活困难，主要原因不是工资少，而是家庭负担重，直接抚养的人口太多。如我们厂医务所保管员顾延运每月工资四十八元五角，按他的职务来看工资不算少，但他负担着三个学生、三个儿童和一个家庭主妇的生活，加上他自己，每人每月平均生活费用仅六元，所以经常要求救济。又如我们厂销售科科长杨国相的工资是一百零八元，家中有四个中学生，两个小学生，两个儿童和一个家庭主妇。有一回因主妇有病，工会救济了一次，有的同志就说：“他挣一百多元，还要救济，我们该怎么办？”杨国相也感到很难为情，但又没有别的办法。
    目前部分职工因家庭负担重，生活困难，思想焦虑，影响生产，也影响家庭团结。有的家庭主妇，除料理家务外，无事可做，左右邻舍，谈闲话传口舌，惹是生非，打架骂人，闹不团结。
    上述情况说明，组织职工家属进行家庭副业生产是必要的。有些家属很希望参加劳动。虽然家庭主妇、老弱病残和学生不能整天参加劳动，但是据我们调查证明，可利用的劳动能力也是很可观的。
    我们在沈阳铁西区齐贤街二百二十九号我厂一个集体家属宿舍进行过调查。那里共有七十名职工，但和他们同居的家属总数达三百零五名。家属当中能劳动的有一百五十二人（包括十二名纯游闲劳动力在内）。其中有男劳动力三十九名，女劳动力为一百一十三名。七十户家庭主妇中，除有十三名因故或因家务而暂不能提供劳动力之外，每日平均可做四个小时的副业生产劳动。学生除了上学和复习之外，每日也可有两个小时劳动。这是个较保守的计算方法，按这个计算标准，在七十户职工家属中，每天即可提供四百五十八个小时的劳动力（折合五十七个工作日）。换句话说，就是一百户职工，其家属每天可以提供八十个劳动力，从事副业生产。
    去年春天，我们组织部分家属为地方国营沈阳绝缘材料厂剥云母片。先后参加的家属有三百十五名。她们一边学习，一边生产，有的只干一两个月或三、四个月，最多是七、八个月。在这种情况下，去年从2 月到9月总共收入七千一百多元。家属孟献荣一个人就收入一百九十八元。杨国相女儿杨湘利用放学后的空闲来剥云母片，从3月到9 月，共挣六十五元七角钱，解决了自己的学费、衣服和零用。这样就增加了职工的收入，改善了生活，并给国家节约了救济金，消除了少数职工单纯依赖国家救济的思想，加强了劳动观念，在劳动中也能提高思想认识，树立起团结互助的风气。
    总之，组织职工家属进行副业劳动生产，是根本解决职工家庭生活困难的好办法。关于劳动对象，除了要求国家统盘考虑外，初步预计有如下几项可供参考：
    一、刺绣、花边、发网、各种线网（篮排球网、乒乓球网、鱼网、网篮等）、毛衣、毛裤、毛头巾、毛围腰、毛围脖及手工针织品（如线书包、手套、线制旅行袋）和手工丝线制品（如各种丝线套包）等。
    二、工业用品：如剥云母片、打石棉绳、麻绳、纸绳、线绳，制各种包装纸盒、纸袋，以及部分劳动保护用品等。
    三、儿童服装（衣裤鞋帽等），布制玩具、木制玩具、毛皮制玩具等。
    四、部分小型零星修补及洗浆工作。
    五、饲养鹌鹑、家兔、鸡鸭、猪等等。
    以上这些是在目前情况下比较容易进行的室内劳动。有些家属还可以参加小型轻便运输、短程运输（如替合作社或百货公司送货、送米、送菜、送煤或书报等），参加工厂的商品包装工作，参加社会服务行业，或分段清扫街道卫生等。
    为了有领导地组织职工家属进行副业劳动，我向有关部门提出下列几项建议：
    一、建议国家计委转各省市计委，在安排第二个五年计划的市政计划时，把这项工作加以安排。
    二、建议中央统计局转各省市统计局，将全国各地区职工家属劳动能力进行一次调查统计，转有关单位参考，并在今后定期报表，做到心中有数。
    三、建议劳动部在第二个五年计划期内，进行劳动调配时，将这个因素考虑在内，必要时作为市区内部调度对象，并有意识地促使城市人口再进一步减少。
    四、建议商业部、合作总社，成立有关的机构，进行试点和逐步推广这一工作。
    五、建议各省市区人民委员会，在现有手工业合作社和缝纫生产合作社里，组织技术人员和熟练技工参加合作社的家庭劳动生产服务组，进行家庭劳动的技术指导。如果现在手工业生产合作社仍有一部分简单劳动的工人，应动员下农村参加农业劳动，以减少城市人口。
    六、建议第一机械工业部考虑，撤销各电机厂的剥云母片车间，交给职工家属来剥。这样可以节约场房面积，并可减少一部分工资和附加工资及其他有关的附加费用，可以减少福利事业的负担和降低成本。
