Let the Enthusiasm of the Masses Awaken the Dreams of the Conservatives
Henan Water Conservancy Department Goes Down to the Countryside for Rectification, Great Ideological Liberation, Great Leap Forward in Work

(Our newspaper dispatch) Reporter Zheng Qimin reports: The Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Department recently adopted the method of going deep into water conservancy construction sites to conduct rectification, quickly overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, and enabling the department's work to embark on a great leap forward.

At the beginning of this year, the Henan Provincial Party Committee proposed a hundred days of hard work to realize water conservancy throughout the province. They also requested that the Water Conservancy Department send technical cadres to help farmers build small-scale water conservancy projects; approve the survey and design of more than two hundred medium-sized water conservancy projects; and complete the survey and design of nine large-scale water conservancy projects before the flood season this year. According to conventional methods, completing these tasks, including just the survey and design, would take five years. Therefore, leading cadres and engineering technicians in the department almost all believed that this task was impossible to complete. As a result, the department's 1958 leap forward plan was discussed in the office for more than half a month without being finalized. However, the situation of the great leap forward was not waiting for anyone. Many medium-sized water conservancy projects were started by the masses without completing the design approval procedures stipulated by the Water Conservancy Department, and some had already been completed. Now they are all requesting the Water Conservancy Department to send people down to conduct technical appraisals.

How to solve this problem? At this time, the Water Conservancy Department's rectification leading group, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, decided to no longer conduct closed-door rectification. Therefore, in late January and mid-February, the three directors of the Water Conservancy Department led all the cadres of the department in two batches to the key water conservancy construction project areas of Huaiyang, Xiangcheng, Shangshui, and Yanling, etc., to visit and learn, help farmers summarize experiences, and at the same time launch a "double anti" movement on the spot. Upon arriving among the masses, they saw the vast and vigorous water conservancy construction movement, which greatly moved these engineering technicians and leading cadres. Everyone felt that their right-leaning conservative thinking was too serious. Engineer Chen Yeqing said at the rectification and airing meeting that when he personally saw the peasant masses of Fugou County relying solely on local masons and carpenters to build a large sluice gate on the Jialu River in less than a month that could pass a water flow of 430 cubic meters per second, and costing only 100,000 yuan, he was so moved that he shed tears. He said that if this project were to be designed by the old minds of the Water Conservancy Department engineers, it would require at least one million yuan of state investment, and the design alone would take half a year.

Therefore, after they returned from their visit and study, they immediately launched a vigorous upsurge of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced in the office. They universally demanded a great revolution in the technology of water conservancy engineering design and construction, design rules and regulations, and design procedures. As a result, in more than half a month, the department's engineering technicians swept away the old rules and regulations and old systems that restricted the development of productive forces and affected the enthusiasm of the masses, and changed the old working style of following old ways and sticking to conventions. The Water Conservancy Design Institute under the department has so far revised more than 30 outdated and unnecessary design approval procedures and design regulation outlines. Many designers have also begun to step out of the office and go to the site with drawings and instruments, designing and constructing at the same time, which has greatly improved work efficiency. For example, when designing the Huayuankou Yellow River irrigation canal, which irrigates 260,000 mu of land, the design institute took a whole year to design. Now, with the same manpower, it only takes three and a half months to complete the design of the Sanyisai Yellow River irrigation project, which can irrigate 20 million mu of land. The engineering technicians of this institute, due to their revolutionary enthusiasm, recently also revised the design of the Banqiao irrigation canal project, increasing the irrigated area from the original 280,000 mu to the current 1.1 million mu, while the required project cost was reduced from the original 5.22 million yuan to the current 2 million yuan, saving the state a large amount of investment.

According to this year's Henan water conservancy construction plan, a total of 100,000 tons of cement are needed this year, but the amount that the central government can supply is only 20,000 tons. Before the cadres of the department went down to visit and study, many people thought that this difficulty could not be solved. However, after they returned from their visit, overcame right-leaning conservative thinking, and were full of revolutionary enthusiasm, this difficulty was also easily solved. Their method is to save a large amount of cement from large-scale water conservancy projects on the one hand, and on the other hand, the department's Scientific Research Institute has now researched an effective method for manufacturing substitute cement, and plans to establish five substitute cement manufacturing plants in counties with substitute cement raw materials to produce a large amount of substitute cement, so as to ensure the supply of cement needed for medium and small water conservancy projects.

The work style and leadership style of the leading cadres of the department have also recently undergone relatively significant improvements. Among the four directors, three directors often lead engineering technicians to the grassroots level to specifically check and help solve technical problems in the construction of water conservancy projects in various counties. In the past, the engineering designs of counties and special districts were sent to the Provincial Water Conservancy Department for approval. Now, most of them are approved on the spot by the Water Conservancy Department's work teams (led by the directors) who go down regularly, which greatly saves time. For example, the design plan of the Liwan Reservoir project in Mi County was approved on the spot, and it only took one day.

After overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, the work of the Water Conservancy Department immediately changed. Not only did it undertake the work tasks that originally required five years to complete, but it also streamlined 61% of its cadres and transferred 45% of its water conservancy technical personnel to enrich the grassroots.

    让群众的干劲唤醒保守者的迷梦
    河南水利厅　下乡去整风　思想大解放　工作大跃进
    本报讯　记者郑启民报道：河南省水利厅最近采取了深入水利建设工地进行整风的方法，迅速克服了右倾保守思想，使全厅工作开始大跃进。
    今年年初，中共河南省委提出苦战一百天，全省实现水利化，并要水利厅下放技术干部，帮助农民兴修小型水利工程；审批二百多个中型水利工程的勘测和设计；提前在今年汛期以前勘测和设计九个大型水利工程。按照常规，完成这些任务仅仅勘测和设计，就要五年。因此，该厅领导干部和工程技术人员几乎都认为这个任务无法完成。因此，该厅1958年的跃进计划，在机关里讨论了半个多月，一直订不下来。但是，大跃进的形势是不等人的。许多中型水利工程没等办完水利厅所规定的设计审批手续，群众就干了起来，而且有的已经完工。现在都要求水利厅派人下去做技术鉴定。
    怎么解决呢？这时水利厅整风领导小组根据省委的指示，决定不再关门整风，于是在1月下旬和2月中旬由水利厅三个厅长分别率领全厅干部，先后分两批下到淮阳、项城、商水和鄢陵等几个水利建设重点工程地区，一面参观学习，一面帮助农民总结经验，同时就地开展“双反”运动。一到群众中看到了万马奔腾声势浩大的水利建设运动，大大地感动了这些工程技术人员和领导干部。大家感到自己右倾保守思想太严重了。工程师陈业清在整风鸣放会上说，当他亲眼看到扶沟县农民群众仅仅依靠当地的泥水匠和木匠，在不到一个月的时间就在贾鲁河上修起了一个能通过四百三十秒公方水量的大水闸，而且只花了十万元的时候，他被感动得掉了眼泪。他说这项工程如果要让我们水利厅工程师们的旧脑筋来设计，至少需要国家投资一百万元，而且光设计就需要半年时间。
    因此，当他们参观学习回来之后，立即在机关里掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的比先进、学先进、赶先进的热潮，普遍要求在水利工程的设计施工的技术上、设计规章制度和设计程序上来一个大革命。因此，该厅工程技术人员在半个多月内一扫那些限制生产力发展、影响群众积极性的旧规章和旧制度，改变了过去的那种因循守旧、墨守陈规的工作作风。该厅所属的水利设计院，到目前为止，已经修改了三十多项过了时的不必要的设计审批手续和设计规程纲要。许多设计人员，也开始走出办公室，带着图纸和仪器到现场去，边设计边施工，大大地提高了工作效率。如以前设计灌溉二十六万亩地的花园口引黄灌溉渠时，该设计院整整设计了一年时间，现在设计可灌溉二千万亩地的三义塞引黄灌溉工程，以同样的人力，只需要三个半月就可完成。这个院的工程技术人员由于鼓足了革命干劲，最近还修改了板桥灌溉渠工程的设计，使灌溉面积由原来的二十八万亩，增加到现在的一百一十万亩，而所需的工程费，却由原来的五百二十二万元，减少到现在的二百万元，给国家节省了大量的投资。
    按照今年河南水利建设计划，今年共需要水泥十万吨，而中央可能供应的数量只有二万吨。在该厅干部未下去参观学习以前，许多人都认为这个困难无法解决。但是当他们参观回来，克服了右倾保守思想，鼓足了革命干劲之后，这个困难也迎刃而解了。他们的办法是一方面由大型水利工程大量节省水泥，另一方面，该厅科学研究所现在已研究出一种制造代水泥的有效方法，计划在有代水泥原料的县建立五个代水泥制造厂，大量生产代水泥，这样就可保证供应中、小型水利工程所需要的水泥。
    该厅领导干部的工作作风和领导作风最近也有了比较显著的改进。四个厅长中，现在经常有三个厅长带领着工程技术人员下到基层去，具体检查和帮助解决各县水利工程建设中的技术问题。过去县和专区的工程设计都送到省水利厅来审批，现在大部分都由定期下去的水利厅的工作队（厅长率领）就地审批，大大节省了时间。如最近密县李湾水库工程的设计方案，由于采用了就地审批的办法，只用了一天时间。
    右倾保守思想克服之后，水利厅的工作立即改观了，不但担负起原来需要五年时间才能完成的工作任务，而且精简了61％的干部，抽调出45％的水利技术人员充实了基层。
