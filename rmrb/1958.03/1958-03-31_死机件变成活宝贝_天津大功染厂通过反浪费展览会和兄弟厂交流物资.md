Dead Machine Parts Become Living Treasures
Tianjin Dagong Dyeing Factory Exchanges Materials with Brother Factories Through Anti-Waste Exhibition

(Reported by this newspaper) The Tianjin Dagong Dyeing Factory, through an anti-waste exhibition and exchanges with brother factories, has turned long-term stockpiled "dead machine parts" in warehouses into "living treasures" for socialist construction.

The Dagong Dyeing Factory is a factory with only over 200 employees. During the anti-waste movement, it cleared out over a thousand stockpiled materials from its warehouse, including many machine parts and raw materials that the factory did not need at all. Considering that these stockpiled materials might be useful to other brother factories, the factory held an exhibition and invited the directors of several nearby factories to visit. The director of the People's Paper Mill No. 2 discovered many drying rollers among the exhibits, which were exactly what they had been unable to purchase for a long time. The Dagong Dyeing Factory immediately agreed to transfer sixteen of them, enabling the People's Paper Mill No. 2 to put a dryer into production five months ahead of schedule, which was originally planned for August. This would increase the annual paper production by 1,200 tons and reduce costs by more than 66,000 yuan. The People's Paper Mill No. 2 was also inspired by this and prepared to transfer its stockpiled bearings and shaft collars to the No. 2 Steel Rolling Mill, which is currently in urgent need of shaft collars.

In order to conduct material exchanges more widely, the factory then invited purchasing personnel from several nearby factories to visit, and the visitors were greatly inspired. The purchaser of the Jucheng Iron Factory said, "Our factory blindly purchased more than two tons of 12 cm square iron in the past, which we don't need at all, and we can take it out to supply factories in need."

Make the Best Use of Everything

The practice of the Tianjin Dagong Dyeing Factory in turning the anti-waste exhibition into a "materials exchange fair" is worth promoting. This kind of exhibition can not only eliminate various wasteful ideologies such as bureaucracy, departmentalism, extravagance, and arrogance from socialist enterprises, but also clear up materials and exchange materials through the exhibition, so that stockpiled materials can be used in production and construction. In this way, many "dead machine parts" and "dead materials" become "living treasures."

Judging from the materials revealed from various sources, the amount of useful materials sleeping in the warehouses of many factories is astonishing. More than 1,000 young shock workers in the Tianjin Steel Plant uncovered more than 3,000 cases of stockpiling and waste in four departments in just one day, including stockpiles of valuable tools and machine parts worth 4,500 taels of gold. Shock workers at the Hengda Cigarette Factory cleared out more than 270 kinds of hardware, steel, tools, and machine parts of various sizes in just four hours. In the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, all sectors urgently need raw materials and machine parts. It is a serious waste to let materials that you don't need or don't need for the time being lie sleeping in the warehouse. Therefore, we hope that every industrial and mining enterprise will learn from the practice of the Tianjin Dagong Dyeing Factory, and actively transfer the "dead machine parts" and "dead materials" that are found in the anti-waste movement to other units, so that they all become living treasures.

### 死机件变成活宝贝  天津大功染厂通过反浪费展览会和兄弟厂交流物资

    死机件变成活宝贝
    天津大功染厂通过反浪费展览会和兄弟厂交流物资
    本报讯　天津大功染厂利用反浪费展览会和兄弟厂交流物资，使长年积压在仓库里的“死机件”变成了建设社会主义的“活宝贝”。
    大功染厂是一个只有二百多职工的厂子，在反浪费运动中，从仓库里清查出上千件积压的物资，其中有许多机件和原材料是厂里根本用不着的。厂里考虑到这些积压物资对其他兄弟厂可能有用，于是举行展览，邀请附近几个工厂的厂长来参观。人民造纸二厂厂长在展览品中发现有许多烘干辊，正是他们好久没有买到的东西。大功染厂立即答应调给他们十六个，使人民造纸二厂原计划在8月份才能投入生产的一个烘干机，提前五个多月投入生产，全年可增产一千二百吨纸，降低成本六万六千多元。人民造纸二厂由此也受到启发，准备把自己厂里积压的轴承、轴领调给现在正急需轴领的轧钢二厂。
    为了更广泛地进行物资交流，这个厂接着又邀请了附近几个厂的采购人员前来参观，参观者受到很大的启发。聚成铁工厂的采购员说：“我们厂过去盲目购进了两吨多十二糎的方铁，根本用不着，可以拿出来供给需要的工厂。”
    物尽其用
    天津大功染厂把反浪费展览会变成“物资交流会”的作法是值得推广的。这种展览会不仅可以把官僚主义、本位主义、阔气、骄气等造成浪费的各种思想从社会主义的企业中清扫出去，同时，还可以通过展览会清理物资，交流物资，把积压物资用到生产和建设中去。这样，许多“死机件”“死材料”就变成“活宝贝”了。
    从各方面揭发的材料来看，不少工厂沉睡在仓库里的有用物资是多得惊人的。天津钢厂的一千多名青年突击队员，在四个部门里仅在一天内就揭发出积压浪费三千多件，其中积压有贵重的工具和机器零件价值黄金四千五百两。恒大烟厂的突击队员仅在四小时内，清查出大小五金器材、各种钢材、工具和机器零件，就达二百七十余种。在工农业生产大跃进中，各方面都迫切需要原材料和机件，让自己用不着或者暂时用不着的物资躺在仓库里睡大觉，是一种严重的浪费。因此，我们希望每个工矿企业都学习天津大功染厂的做法，把在反浪费中反出来的“死机件”、“死材料”，主动地调给别的单位，让它们都变成活宝贝。
