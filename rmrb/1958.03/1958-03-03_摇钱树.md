    "Money Tree"
    Mountainous area residents call the walnut tree a "money tree" because it has significant economic value.
    The walnut, also known as the hu tao (walnut), is a deciduous tree planted in most provinces of China, with a higher concentration in North and Northwest China. Some areas in the South also have concentrated plantings of this tree, such as in Yangbi County, Yunnan, which has 62,000 mu of walnut trees. According to incomplete statistics from the forestry department last year, there are currently over 20 million fruit-bearing walnut trees in China, totaling approximately one million mu (calculated at 20 trees per mu).
    The walnut is an important economic forest tree. Walnut kernels contain rich fats and proteins, which can be pressed for oil, eaten as dried fruit, or used as medicine; the walnut tree trunk is a tough, lustrous, and valuable timber; the green skin and hard shell of the walnut are also very useful.
    Walnuts grow relatively quickly, reaching over one zhang (approx. 3.3 meters) in height three to four years after planting, but they bear fruit very late, generally after eight to fifteen years. The saying "Don't plant a walnut orchard until you have a son," which was circulated in some areas in the past, refers to its late fruiting. In Fufeng County, Shaanxi, there is a type of "alternate-year walnut" that begins to bear fruit in the second year after sowing; in the Shangluo area, there are varieties that bear fruit in five to seven years; in Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, walnuts have also been observed to bear fruit six years after sowing. Licheng County, Shandong, has a method of grafting walnuts onto Chinese wingceltis rootstock to promote early fruiting. These varieties and grafting methods are worth promoting.
    China's walnut kernel production and quality rank first in the world market. The value of China's annual walnut kernel exports is very high; one ton of walnut kernels can be exchanged for nine tons of steel or seventeen tons of chemical fertilizer. Due to the high value and wide market for walnut kernels, planting walnuts is more profitable than planting general economic forest trees. Shaanxi Province calculated the following: if each household in the Shangluo Special Zone plants one sheng (approx. 1 liter) of walnuts, the output value can reach around 100 million yuan after ten years, and each household can increase its income by 250 yuan. As a source of oil, these walnuts can produce 24 million jin (12,000 metric tons) of oil, which, in addition to supplying the people of this area for consumption, can also support one hundred million urban residents for one month. In Meixi Township, Yangbi County, Yunnan Province, about 50% of farmers' total income comes from walnuts. It can be seen that there is a reason why the people in mountainous areas call the walnut tree a "money tree."
    Walnuts can be sown in spring or autumn. Seeds for spring sowing are generally those harvested in the previous year and stored using a mixed sand burial method. Spring-sown walnuts sprout in about a month, and the seedlings can grow to about one chi (approx. 33 cm) in the same year. There are many walnut varieties, and when propagating, one should choose those with thin shells, full kernels, early fruiting, and abundant fruiting. (Qi)

### “摇钱树”

    “摇钱树”
    山区群众把核桃树叫“摇钱树”，因为核桃树有重要的经济价值。
    核桃又叫胡桃，是一种落叶乔木，我国多数省份都种植，其中以华北、西北地区较多。南方一些地区也有集中种植这种林木的，像云南漾濞一县就有核桃六万二千亩。据林业部门去年不完全统计，目前我国结实的核桃有两千多万株，约合一百万亩（以二十株一亩计算）。
    核桃是一种重要经济林木。核桃果仁含有丰富脂肪和蛋白质，可以榨油，也可以作为干果食用或作为药物治病；核桃树干是一种坚韧光泽的贵重木材；核桃青皮、硬壳也都很有用处。
    核桃生长较快，造林三、四年后就有一丈多高，但是结实很迟，一般要到八至十五年以后。过去一些地区流传的“无儿不种核桃园”就是针对它结实晚而说的。陕西扶风县有一种播种后第二年就开始结实的“隔年核桃”，商雒地区有种五到七年结实的品种；山西省屯留县，也出现过播种后六年见果实的核桃。山东历城县有用枫杨作砧木嫁接核桃，促使提早结实的办法。这些品种和嫁接方法值得推广。
    我国桃仁的产量和质量在世界市场上占首席地位。我国每年出口桃仁的价值很大，一吨桃仁可以换回九吨钢材，或十七吨化学肥料。由于桃仁的价值大、销路广，种植核桃的收益高于一般经济林木。陕西省算过这样一笔账：商雒专区每户种一升核桃，十年后产值可到一亿元左右，每户可增加二百五十元收入。作为油料用，这些核桃可以榨油两千四百万斤，除供应这个区人民食用以外，还可以支援一亿城市居民吃一个月。云南漾濞县美翕乡农民总收入50％左右来自核桃。可见山区群众把核桃树叫做“摇钱树”是有来由的。
    核桃可以春播也可以秋播。春播种子一般是前一年收获后，用混沙埋藏的方法留储的。春播的核桃约一个月可发芽，幼苗当年能长到一尺左右。核桃品种很多，繁殖的时候应该选择壳薄仁满、结实早、结实多的。（起）
