　　Wait and See
　　Here are two propositions: First, the Soviet Union accepted Gaillard's suggestion and agreed to hold a foreign ministers' meeting to prepare the agenda and determine the members of a summit conference; second, Dulles opposed the Soviet Union's suggestion, believing that the foreign ministers' meeting must discuss substantive issues.
　　What conclusion should be drawn from this? Anyone with a little understanding of logic would know that the conclusion is: Dulles opposes Gaillard's suggestion.
　　However, after a meeting with Dulles, the French Ambassador to the United States, Alphand, stated that France and the United States are in complete agreement on the Soviet Union's proposal for summit preparation.
　　At first glance, one would feel that this French diplomat's thinking lacks logic. However, let's not rush to criticize the respectable Mr. Alphand personally! Because it is not unprecedented for a French Prime Minister to immediately turn around and oppose his own proposal after seeing the U.S. Secretary of State express disagreement. Whether Alphand's statement is a harbinger of this situation is something people should wait and see.

    拭目以待
    下面有两个命题：一，苏联接受了盖伊阿的意见，同意召开外长会议来为最高级会议准备议程和确定成员；二，杜勒斯反对苏联的意见，认为外长会议必须进行实质问题的讨论。
    由此应该得出什么结论呢？只要稍为懂得一点逻辑的人就会知道，结论是：杜勒斯反对盖伊阿的意见。
    然而，法国驻美大使阿尔芳在同杜勒斯作了一次会谈以后却表示，法国和美国对苏联关于最高级会议准备工作的建议，意见完全是一致的。
    猛一看，人们就会感到这位法国外交官员的思想太没有逻辑性了。不过，还是先不要对可敬的阿尔芳先生个人提出这种责难吧！因为，法国总理提出一个主张后，一看到美国国务卿表示不同意就马上转过头来反对自己的主张，这样的事并非没有先例。这次阿尔芳的表示是不是这种情况即将出现的一个预兆，人们且拭目以待。
