    Millennial ginkgo trees in Lushan, after intentional artificial cultivation, have sent forth new branches again and are welcoming visitors and tourists with youthful vigor.
    In front of the Huanglong Temple in Lushan, Jiangxi, there are three ancient trees: two willow pines and one ginkgo, known as the Three Treasures of Lushan. The ginkgo tree was planted by the eminent monk Tanxi of the Jin Dynasty and has a life of over a thousand years. It is thirty-three meters high and its trunk is thick enough to be embraced by four people. This ginkgo tree was almost cut down by Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan. After liberation, the People's Government, while repairing historical sites and scenic spots, built wooden fences for protection and cultivated it artificially. (Xinhua News Agency)

    千年银杏发新枝
    庐山千年银杏经过人工加意培养，已重发新枝，正以青春姿态迎接访问游览的人们。
    在江西庐山黄龙寺门前，有三棵古树，二柳松，一银杏，号称庐山三宝树。银杏是晋朝高僧昙洗手植，已有一千多年的寿命，树高三十三公尺，粗可四人合抱。这棵银杏在抗日战争中，几遭日寇砍伐。解放后，人民政府在修缮名胜古迹的同时，筑木栏围护，并加以人工培养。　（新华社）
