    Tea Production Ten-Year Plan
    Output to Increase Elevenfold, Mechanization to be Achieved in Tea Regions
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Hangzhou) The National Tea Production and Experimental Research Great Leap Forward Conference was held in Hangzhou from March 5th to 14th.

    The conference initially proposed a ten-year plan for national tea production. Upon realizing this plan: the total tea output this year will increase by 34% compared to 1957, reaching more than three million dan (1 dan = 50kg); by 1962, it will be more than double that of 1957. By 1967, tea production will increase elevenfold compared to 1957.

    The conference required all regions to focus on three tasks in tea production starting immediately: First, increase the yield per unit area of the existing 5.73 million mu (1 mu ≈ 0.16 acres) of tea gardens, achieving an average yield of 87 jin (1 jin = 0.5kg) per mu within three years and 120 jin within five years; to this end, advanced measures such as filling gaps, terrace trimming, pruning, and fertilization should be adopted within three years to transform old tea gardens into high-yielding tea gardens. Second, reclaim 30 million mu of new tea gardens in the hilly areas across the country within ten years, with more than two-thirds to be completed during the second Five-Year Plan. Third, improve preliminary processing and rapidly promote the use of tea-making tools to replace hand-rolling and foot-treading. Mechanization and modernization of tea regions should be achieved within ten years.

    茶叶生产十年规划
    产量增加十一倍　茶区实现机械化
    本报杭州讯　3月5日至14日在杭州召开了全国茶叶生产及试验研究大跃进会议。
    会议初步提出了全国茶叶生产的十年规划。实现了这个规划：今年的茶叶总产量将比1957年增长34％，达三百多万担；1962年为1957年的两倍多。到1967年茶叶产量将比1957年增长十一倍。
    会议要求各地从目前开始，对茶叶生产抓紧三项工作：一、提高现有的五百七十三万亩茶园单位产量，三年内平均亩产达到八十七斤，五年达到一百二十斤；为此，在三年内应采取补缺、台刈、修剪、施肥等先进措施，将老茶园改造成为丰产茶园。二、十年内在全国丘陵地带开辟三千万亩新茶园，第二个五年计划期间要完成三分之二以上。三、要做好初制工作，迅速推广制茶工具代替手揉脚踏。十年内茶区要实现机械化，现代化。
