Why

    Penicillin Injections Require Skin Tests
    Penicillin, also known as Penicillin, is a type of antibiotic. Because it can kill a variety of bacteria, it is often used in cases of bacterial infection.
    The application of penicillin mostly adopts the method of intramuscular injection. In the past, it was very simple, just injecting it directly into the muscle. Now, in many hospitals, a skin test is often performed before injecting penicillin. This involves injecting a very small amount of penicillin into the skin of the forearm to see if there is any reaction. If there is no reaction, then the intramuscular injection is performed. This is because in recent years, cases of shock (commonly known as apparent death or coma) caused by penicillin injections have been occurring continuously in various countries. It turns out that some patients have a special sensitivity to certain drugs, and injecting such drugs will immediately cause shock, which can lead to actual death if rescue is not timely. The purpose of the skin test is to prevent allergic shock. People who are sensitive to penicillin, even if a small amount of penicillin is injected into the skin, will develop local redness and swelling, and even blisters or ulcers. This indicates that the patient cannot use penicillin. Someone who used penicillin a long time ago without a reaction may still experience shock now, because sensitivity to drugs is not constant. However, people who have used penicillin within a few months and have proven to have no reaction generally do not need to undergo a skin test.
    In fact, for some patients with a history of allergic shock, a test should be performed before using any medication. (Gu Ruijin)

### 打青霉素要试针

专栏：为什么

    打青霉素要试针
    青霉素又叫配尼西林，是抗生素的一种。因为它能杀死多种细菌，所以在发生细菌感染的时候常常要用到它。
    应用青霉素大多采用肌肉注射的办法。过去很简单，把它直接打进肌肉里就完了，现在，在许多医院里，注射青霉素之前常常要作一个皮肤试验，就是在前臂的皮内注入很小量的青霉素，看看有没有反应，如果没有反应，再作肌肉注射。这是因为近年来各国相继不断地发生注射青霉素后引起休克（俗称假死或昏迷）的事件。原来某些病人对某些药物有特殊的敏感性，一注入这种药物就立刻会休克，如果抢救不及，就会真正死去。作皮肤试验的目的就是为了预防过敏休克。对青霉素敏感的人，即使皮内注入很少量的青霉素，也会发生局部红肿、甚至形成水皰或溃烂。这就暗示这个病人不能用青霉素。有人很久以前用过青霉素而没有反应的，现在再用也不一定不发生休克，因为对药物的敏感性不是一成不变的。但是，一般在几个月内用过青霉素证明没有反应的人，就不一定要作皮肤试验了。
    其实对于有些有过过敏休克历史的病人，用任何药物前都应该先作个试验。（顾瑞金）
