    Spring plowing season has begun!
    The success or failure of spring plowing has a decisive significance for the year's production. We must seize this work and fight the first battle of this year's agricultural production well.
    The debate on the two roads has greatly raised the awareness of the broad masses of peasants, a winter of intense labor has greatly developed water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation work, and the nationwide rectification movement has greatly transformed the thinking and working style of leading cadres at all levels. From any perspective, the favorable conditions for agricultural production this year are unprecedented. As long as we do not miss the opportunity and do a good job in spring plowing, coupled with unremitting efforts throughout the year, it is highly hopeful to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production this year.
    May the people of urban and rural areas across the country work together to set off a high tide of spring plowing and production!

    春耕
    春耕季节开始了！
    春耕成绩的好坏，对全年生产有决定意义。必须抓紧这项工作，打好今年农业生产的第一仗。
    两条道路的辩论使广大农民的觉悟大大提高了，一冬的紧张劳动使水利和积肥工作大大发展了，全民的整风运动使各级领导干部的思想作风大大转变了；无论从那方面来看，今年农业生产的有利条件都是从来没有过的。只要我们不失时机，搞好春耕，再加上全年不懈的努力，使农业生产在今年来一个大跃进，是大有希望的。
    愿全国城乡人民一齐努力，掀起一个春耕大生产的高潮！
