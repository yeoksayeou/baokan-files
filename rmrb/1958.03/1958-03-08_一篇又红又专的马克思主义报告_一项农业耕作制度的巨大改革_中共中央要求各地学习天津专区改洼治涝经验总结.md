    A Marxist Report That Is Both Red and Expert
    A Huge Reform of Agricultural Cultivation System
    The CCP Central Committee Demands All Localities to Learn from the Tianjin Special District's Experience in Transforming Low-lying Land and Controlling Waterlogging
    (Dispatch from our newspaper) The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has approved the "Summary Report on Transforming Low-lying Land and Controlling Waterlogging in Tianjin Special District" by Comrade Zhao Ke, First Secretary of the Tianjin District Committee of the Communist Party of China (full text of the report on page two), and made the following instructions:
    The experience of Tianjin Special District in transforming low-lying land and controlling waterlogging, as summarized by Comrade Zhao Ke in this report, is extremely good and is a Marxist report that is both red and expert. With the experience of Tianjin Special District and Comrade Zhao Ke's summary report, not only are the principles for transforming low-lying land and controlling waterlogging correctly resolved, but there are also systematic and specific methods in all aspects. From now on, the vast low-lying and waterlogged areas north of the Huai River can use these methods to improve in the coming years, making these areas high-yield areas for agriculture and sideline production. In the low-lying and waterlogged areas south of the Huai River, because the situation is different, the experience of Tianjin Special District cannot be fully adopted, but some experiences can be adopted. It is hoped that comrades in the relevant provinces, cities, districts, and counties will carefully read Comrade Zhao Ke's report, study the experience of Tianjin Special District, and distribute this report to all relevant district and township cadres to read, in order to transform all low-lying and waterlogged areas and greatly increase production there.
    In addition, one point in this report is very noteworthy, which is the issue of switching to rice cultivation in all areas north of the Huai River with water sources. Most of the areas north of the Huai River have fertile land. According to existing experience, as long as rice can be planted, the yield per unit area can be increased several times or even several times. The yield per unit area in some places is even higher than in southern China. Therefore, not only should low-lying and waterlogged areas massively switch to rice cultivation, but all other areas with water sources, whether mountainous, hilly, or flat, should also massively switch to rice cultivation in order to rapidly increase the yield of low-yield areas north of the Huai River. This policy was proposed several years ago, and great achievements have been made in many areas. However, many areas have not paid enough attention to the issue of switching to rice cultivation, and the promotion has been weak, resulting in little success. Therefore, it is necessary to raise awareness again. It is hoped that comrades in provinces, cities, districts, counties, districts, and townships north of the Huai River will actively and vigorously promote where conditions are suitable for switching to rice cultivation and where there is experience in switching to rice cultivation. Those who do not yet have experience in switching to rice cultivation should also conduct widespread trials in 1958, so that every township and every cooperative with conditions for switching to rice cultivation will have a plot of land for trial planting in order to gain experience and gradually promote it in the future. In the vast areas north of the Huai River and the Qinling Mountains, including the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions of North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China, after a considerable period of vigorous transformation, it is possible to develop hundreds of millions of mu of paddy fields, greatly increasing the yield of grain and other economic crops.
    It is hoped that comrades in all regions will seriously pay attention to this reform of the cultivation system.

    一篇又红又专的马克思主义报告
    一项农业耕作制度的巨大改革
    中共中央要求各地学习天津专区改洼治涝经验总结
    本报讯　中国共产党中央委员会批发了中共天津地委第一书记赵克同志关于天津专区改造洼地和治涝经验总结报告（报告全文见第二版），并作了如下的批语：
    赵克同志在这个报告中所总结的天津专区改造洼地和治涝的经验极好，是一篇又红又专的马克思主义的报告。有了天津专区的这个经验，又有了赵克同志的这个总结报告，不但是正确地解决了改造洼地和治涝的方针问题，而且有了系统的各方面的具体办法，从此，淮河以北广大低洼易涝地区都可以采用这些办法在最近几年内治好，使这些地区成为农业和副业的高产地区。在淮河以南的低洼易涝地区，因为情况有所不同，天津专区的经验不能全部采用，但也有某些经验是可以采用的。望各有关的省、市、地、县的同志们仔细阅读赵克同志这个报告，研究天津专区的经验，并且将这个报告发给所有有关的区乡干部阅读，用以改造所有低洼易涝地区，大大的提高那里的生产。
    此外，在这个报告中还有一点是十分值得注意的，就是在淮河以北一切有水源的地区改种水稻的问题。淮河以北的大部分地区土地肥沃，根据已有的经验，只要能够改种水稻，单位面积的产量就可以成倍甚至几倍地提高。有些地方的单位产量甚至比江南还高。因此，不但低洼易涝地区应当大量地改种水稻，其他一切有水源的地区，不论是山地、丘陵地、平地也应当大量地改种水稻，以便迅速地提高淮河以北低产地区的产量。这个方针在几年以前就提出来了，在不少地区也已取得了很大的成绩，但是，还有许多地区对于改种水稻的问题注意不够，推行不力，成绩不大。因此，有必要再一次提起注意。希望淮河以北各省、市、地、县、区、乡的同志，对于凡有条件改种水稻，并且有了改种水稻的经验的，应当积极地大力地推广，还没有改种水稻的经验的，也应当在1958年普遍试种，使凡有条件改种水稻的每一个乡、每一个合作社都有一块土地试种，以便取得经验，在以后逐步推广。在淮河和秦岭以北的广大地区，包括华北、东北、西北各省、市、自治区，经过相当长期的大力的改造，是可以开辟几亿亩水稻田，大大提高粮食及其他经济作物的产量的。
    望各地同志认真地注意这一个耕作制度的改革。
                                      一九五八年三月七日
