Singing the Autonomous Region (Zhuang Folk Songs)
　　The Zhuang people live in the gullies under the mountains,
　　Suffering year after year in bitter poverty.
　　Truly poor, oh so poor,
　　Hungry and cold day and night.
　　The thunder rumbles, the sky clears,
　　The Zhuang people emerge from the gullies and open their eyes.
　　The Communist Party's policies are good,
　　The minority nationalities stand up.
　　Their own representatives they elect,
　　Their own affairs they manage themselves.
　　Truly good, oh so good,
　　The establishment of the autonomous region is before our eyes.
　　Our hearts open like an umbrella.
　　The trees grown all over the mountains
　　Are covered with golden and silver fruits.
　　The wind blows, they sway gently,
　　Reflecting a face blooming with flowers.
　　Opening the gate for a glance,
　　Our hearts open like an umbrella.
　　The dark clouds have all dispersed,
　　This is Chairman Mao bringing us happiness.
　　The singing comes from Beijing city,
　　The sun is half red in the east.
　　Where does the singing come from?
　　The loudspeaker sounds beneath the big tree.
　　The singing comes from Beijing city.
