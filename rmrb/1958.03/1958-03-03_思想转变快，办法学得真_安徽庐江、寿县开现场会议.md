    Rapid ideological transformation, genuinely learned methods:
    Anhui's Lujiang and Shouxian hold on-site meetings
    (Our newspaper's Hefei dispatch) The CCP committees of Lujiang and Shouxian counties in Anhui Province are breaking with convention, moving discussions on production work from the cities to the countryside, and holding "on-site meetings" in areas with advanced work.
    The Lujiang County Committee recently held a political work conference in the Bai Shan District. Since Bai Shan District began emphasizing political work in December of last year, the district's production work has achieved leaps and bounds. At the conference, the district committee leaders introduced their experiences in conducting political work, and then everyone participated in tours, debates, and summaries. Participants generally reflected that this type of meeting allowed everyone to "see clearly, remember distinctly, transform ideology quickly, and genuinely learn methods."
    In the great leap forward in winter and spring production, the Shouxian County Committee discovered that some areas were advancing by leaps and bounds, while others were progressing slowly, and some lacked comprehensive planning for their work. To address this, the county committee held two meetings of district and township cadres and several telephone and broadcast conferences, but failed to completely resolve the problems. Recently, they changed their approach, moving the meetings to the countryside, organizing visits to advanced areas, and conducting observations and comparisons. After the meeting, revolutionary competitions immediately began between districts, townships, and communes, and everyone actively took action.

    思想转变快，办法学得真
    安徽庐江、寿县开现场会议
    本报合肥讯　安徽省庐江、寿县等县中共县委打破常规，把一些讨论生产工作的会议从城里搬到乡下去开，在工作的先进地区召开“现场会议”。
    庐江县委最近在白山区召开了一次政治工作会议。白山区自去年12月重视政治工作以来，全区生产工作取得了飞跃的进步。这次会上，由区委负责人介绍了做政治工作的经验，然后，边参观、边辩论、边总结。参加会的人普遍反映，这样开会使大家“看的清，记的明，思想转变快，办法学得真。”
    寿县县委在冬春两季生产大跃进中，发现有的地区突飞猛进，有的地区慢慢腾腾，有的对工作还缺乏全面安排。县委为此曾开过两次区乡干部会议和数次电话会议、广播会议，都未能彻底解决问题。最近改变办法，把会议搬到农村中去开，组织参观先进，观摩评比。会后，区、乡、社之间当即开展了革命竞赛，积极行动起来。
