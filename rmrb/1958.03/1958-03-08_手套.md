Gloves

	"Report!" The door opened, and a little girl walked in. I looked, and it turned out to be Xiao Hui from Class 3 of the first grade. I asked, "What is it?"
	"For you!" Xiao Hui took out a pair of white gloves from her pocket and placed them on my desk.
	"Where did these come from? Did you find them?"
	"No, I didn't find them!" Xiao Hui shook her head: "My mother and I are giving them to you!"
	Giving them to me? I stood up and smiled, stroking Xiao Hui's head, "Thank you to you and your mother!..."
	"You're welcome!"
	I picked up the gloves, rolled them into a roll, and stuffed them into Xiao Hui's hands, "Take them back! Just say..."
	"No!"
	"Take them back! Thank you to you and your mother!"
	"No way!..." Xiao Hui tossed her pigtails tied with a green bow, pouting.
	There was nothing I could do, so I put on a stern face and pretended to be angry, "Xiao Hui, aren't you listening to your teacher?"
	"Yes!..." Xiao Hui said softly.
	"Then take the gloves back!" I couldn't help but smile: "Thank you to you and your mother!"
	Xiao Hui put the gloves into her pocket, her big dark eyes filled with tears. I fully understood the child's heart, but how could I say something to make her happy? I only gently patted Xiao Hui's head and said, "Go on!..."
	Xiao Hui was stunned, said, "Goodbye, teacher!" and left.
	The next day, Xiao Hui came to me again, and without saying anything, she only saluted me, then put a package on my desk, said, "Goodbye, teacher!" and turned around and ran out.
	I opened the package: inside were still the gloves from yesterday, and also a letter.
	"Teacher Du:
	Yesterday, the child came home from school crying. I asked and learned that it was because you didn't want the gloves. I understand the reason why you don't want these gloves, but you should accept this small gift, because it represents the child's heart...
	Two weeks ago, Xiao Hui came back and said to me: 'Mom, let's give the teacher a pair of gloves!'
	'Why?' I asked her.
	'The teacher told us to prepare three cottons (note). He said that he didn't have gloves last year, so his hands got frostbitten. When his hands got frostbitten, it was so uncomfortable at noon!' I immediately agreed and said, 'Okay! We will definitely give the teacher a pair of gloves.' The child listened and smiled so wide she couldn't close her mouth. 'Mom, you really have to give them! Otherwise, our teacher's hands will get frostbitten again, it'll be so painful!'
	After that, she would come back from school every day and ask me, 'Mom, have the gloves been bought yet?' When I gave her the gloves, she jumped up with joy: 'The teacher will definitely not have frostbitten hands when he wears these gloves!...' In the evening, she even put the gloves next to her pillow. The next day at noon, when school let out, Xiao Hui cried to me, 'The teacher didn't want my gloves.'
	I understand the reason why you didn't want them, so I said to her, 'The teacher can't just take things from students!'
	'But, what if the teacher gets frostbitten hands again?'
	Yes, I couldn't answer the child's question.
	After a while, Xiao Hui pleaded with me:
	'Mom, think of a way for me! I must give the gloves to the teacher!' So I wrote you this letter. Please accept these gloves!"
	I picked up the gloves and looked at them for a long time. I pressed the gloves tightly against my face. I felt a small heart warming me.

	(Note) Three cottons, refers to cotton hats, cotton gloves, cotton shoes.

    手套
    杜保安
    “报告！”门开了，一个小姑娘走进来。我一看，原来是我们一年级三班的小慧，便问：“有事吗？”
      “给您！”小慧从口袋里掏出一副白手套来，放在了我的桌子上。
    “这是哪儿的？捡的吗？”
      “不，不是捡的！”小慧摇着头：“我和妈妈送给您的！”
    送给我的？我站了起来，微笑着抚摸着小慧的头说：“谢谢你和你的母亲！……”
      “不谢！”
    我把那副手套拿起来，卷成一卷儿，塞到小慧的手里说：“你把它拿回去吧！就说……”
      “不！”
    “拿回去吧！谢谢你和你的母亲！”
    “不嘛！……”小慧把扎着绿蝴蝶结的小辫儿一甩，鼓嘟着嘴说。
    没办法，我只好绷起脸来，假装生气地说：“小慧，你不听老师的话吗？”
    “听！……。”小慧小声说。
    “那就把手套拿回去吧！”我又禁不住地笑了：“谢谢你和你的母亲！”
    小慧把手套装进口袋里，大黑眼珠含着两泡眼泪。我完全了解孩子的心，但是，怎么说才能让她高兴呢？我只轻轻地拍了小慧的脑袋一下，说：“去吧！……”
    小慧楞了楞，说了声：“老师再见！”便走了。
    第二天，小慧又找我来了，见面什么也没说，只给我敬了个礼，然后把一包子东西往我桌上一放，说了声：“老师再见！”扭身便跑出去了。
    我打开包包一看：里面还是昨天那副手套，并且附有一封信。
      “杜老师：
    昨天孩子放学回来，哭了。我一问才知道因为您没要这副手套。我明白您不要这副手套的理由，可是这个小小的礼物，您应该收下，因为它代表着孩子的心……
    还是在两个星期以前，小慧回来就对我说：‘妈妈，我们送给老师一副手套吧！’
    ‘干吗呀？’我问她。
      ‘老师告诉我们，让我们预备三棉（注）。他说他去年没有手套，就把手冻了。冻了手一到晌午可难受啦！当时我便答应她说：‘好吧！我们一定送给老师一副手套。’孩子听了，笑的嘴全合不上了。‘妈妈，你可真送！要不我们老师的手又该冻了，多疼呀！’
    以后，她每天放学回来就问我‘妈妈，手套买来了没有啊？’当我把手套交给她的时候，她欢喜的跳了起来：‘老师戴上这副手套，一定不会冻手了！……’晚上，她还把这副手套放在了枕头旁边。第二天中午放学一回来，小慧就对我哭了‘老师没要我的手套。’
    我明白您不要的理由，就对她说：‘老师是不能随便要学生东西的！’
      ‘可是，老师再冻了手怎么办呀？’
    是呀，我回答不出来孩子的问题。
    待了一会儿，小慧恳求我说：
  ‘妈妈，替我想个法子吧！我一定把手套送给老师！’于是我就给您写了这封信。您收下这副手套吧！”
    我把手套拿起来，长久地看着它。我把手套紧紧地贴在脸上，我感到有一颗小小的心在温暖着我。
      （注）三棉，指棉帽子，棉手
          套，棉鞋。
