Xinhua News Agency, 10th. "By working hard for a year, increase production and conserve equivalent to a joint steel enterprise with an annual output of 500,000 tons of steel and 500,000 tons of iron." This is the fighting goal proposed to more than 200,000 young workers in the city at the Beijing Youth Workers' Anti-Waste and Anti-Conservatism Competition Conference held today.

The initiative was put forward by young workers from four enterprises: Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, State-owned North China Radio Equipment Factory, Beijing Chemical Reagent Factory, and Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company. They suggested that this year, young workers throughout the city should increase production and save 240 million yuan for the country through methods such as saving materials, producing no or fewer defective products, and increasing equipment utilization, which could build a medium-sized joint steel enterprise. More than 6,000 advanced young workers attending the meeting unanimously responded to this initiative and decided to adopt it as the slogan for the actions of young workers throughout the city this year.

Vice Chairman Zhu De attended the meeting and gave important instructions to the young workers.
