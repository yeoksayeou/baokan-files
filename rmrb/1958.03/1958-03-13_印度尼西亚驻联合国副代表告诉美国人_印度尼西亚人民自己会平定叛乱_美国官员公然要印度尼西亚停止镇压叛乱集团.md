Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 12th: Indonesian Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Mohammed Sharif, said on the 11th that the Indonesian government hopes to completely resolve the rebellion in Central Sumatra by Indonesians themselves in the shortest possible time.

Sharif told reporters on NBC's "Today" show: "The Padang rebellion was merely stirred up by a few elements trying to keep wealth and power permanently in the hands of a minority." He pointed out that some of the leaders of the rebels were people who "had long been wanted by our (Indonesian) authorities for corruption, bribery, smuggling, and embezzlement."

Sharif emphasized that Indonesia would not submit this issue to the United Nations for discussion.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 12th: The "Eastern Star Daily" published an editorial today pointing out that it was appropriate for Indonesian government troops to land in Central Sumatra while the SEATO conference was in progress.

The newspaper said that the Hussein rebel group hopes to receive "protection" from SEATO. And now, the Indonesian government's actions will open the eyes of SEATO member states, seeing that the Indonesian government army is capable of landing in Central Sumatra. SEATO should realize that it has wasted energy and equipment in interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs. This action is actually a political adventure that is of no benefit to itself.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 12th: Just as the Indonesian government is marching towards Central Sumatra to suppress the rebellion, US State Department officials issued statements on the 11th, openly interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs. State Department officials said that the US government "hopes" that military operations can "cease soon" and that the Indonesian government and rebel groups can seek some kind of "political solution."

According to UPI reports, US officials admitted that there are currently "several US warships" in the South China Sea near Indonesia. These officials denied that these warships were there to exert pressure on any party in the Indonesian dispute, but diplomats stationed in Washington believe that from Dulles' speech in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, "it can be seen that the United States has some sympathy for the rebel regime's aspirations."

UPI also said meaningfully that both the Indonesian government and the "rebel regime" have made it clear that they do not intend to infringe on the lives and property of Americans in Sumatra, but the State Department is "very concerned" about whether either side "can completely control" certain areas.

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 12th: The London "Times" published an editorial today, openly clamoring that the Indonesian situation "involves international interests," advocating that SEATO conduct "mediation" between the Indonesian government and the Central Sumatra rebel group, that is, to legitimize the rebel group and prevent the Indonesian government from suppressing the military rebellion.

The London "Daily Mail" also demanded on the 11th that the foreign ministers attending the Manila Conference "use their good offices" to stop the Indonesian government from suppressing the rebels.

On the other hand, the Liberal Party's "Manchester Guardian" believes that direct interference in Indonesia's internal affairs by Western countries will have a bad influence. Another newspaper of the Liberal Party, the "News Chronicle," also warned that if Western countries or other members of SEATO are "said to be" interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, "the impact throughout Asia will be unimaginable."

"Workers' Daily" pointed out that "Washington, London and Manila are carrying out various conspiracies to try to restore imperialist control over Indonesia."

    印度尼西亚驻联合国副代表告诉美国人
    印度尼西亚人民自己会平定叛乱
    美国官员公然要印度尼西亚停止镇压叛乱集团
    新华社12日讯　纽约消息：印度尼西亚常驻联合国副代表穆罕默德·沙里夫11日说：印度尼西亚政府希望在最短时间内完全由印度尼西亚人自己来解决中苏门答腊的叛乱问题。
    沙里夫在美国全国广播公司的“今日”节目中对记者说：“巴东的叛乱不过是由若干试图把财富和权力永远掌握在少数人手中的分子搞起来的。”他指出，叛乱分子的一些头子是“由于贪污腐化、行贿、走私和盗用公款而早就被我们（印度尼西亚）当局通缉”的人。
    沙里夫强调，印度尼西亚不会把这个问题提交联合国讨论。
    新华社雅加达12日电　“东星报”今天发表的社论指出，当东南亚条约组织会议正在进行的时候，印度尼西亚政府军队在中苏门答腊登陆是适当的。
    这家报纸说，侯赛尼叛乱集团希望得到东南亚条约组织的“保护”。而现在，印度尼西亚政府的行动将使得东南亚条约组织的成员国睁开眼睛，看到印度尼西亚政府军有能力在中苏门答腊登陆。东南亚条约组织应该认识到它在干涉印度尼西亚内政这件事上已经浪费了精力和装备。这种行动实际上是一种对它自己毫无好处的政治冒险。
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：正当印度尼西亚政府向中苏门答腊进军以镇压叛乱的时候，美国国务院官员11日发表谈话，公开干涉印度尼西亚内政。国务院官员说，美国政府“希望”军事行动能够“早日停止”，印度尼西亚政府和叛乱集团能够求得某种“政治上的解决”。
    据合众社报道，美国官员承认，目前在南中国海印度尼西亚附近的海面上有“几艘美国军舰”。这些官员否认这些军舰是去对印度尼西亚纠纷中的某一方施加压力的，但是驻在华盛顿的外交官员认为，从杜勒斯在众议院外交委员会的讲话里“可以看出美国对叛乱政权的愿望是有所同情的”。
    合众社还意味深长地说，印度尼西亚政府和“叛乱政权”双方都已经明确表示不打算侵犯苏门答腊的美国人的生命和财产，但是国务院“很担心”双方中是否有任何一方“能够完全控制”某些地区。
    据新华社12日讯　伦敦消息：伦敦“泰晤士报”今天发表社论，公然叫嚣印度尼西亚局势“牵涉到国际利益”，主张东南亚条约组织在印度尼西亚政府和中苏门答腊叛乱集团之间进行“调停”，这就是说，使叛乱集团合法化，并且阻止印度尼西亚政府镇压叛乱的军事行动。
    伦敦“每日邮报”11日也要求参加马尼拉会议的外长们“利用他们的斡旋”来制止印度尼西亚政府镇压叛乱分子。
    另一方面，自由党的“曼彻斯特卫报”认为，西方国家直接干涉印度尼西亚的内政将产生不好的影响，自由党的另一家报纸“新闻纪事报”也警告说，西方国家或东南亚条约组织其他成员国如果“被说成”是印度尼西亚内政的干涉者，“其影响在整个亚洲将不堪设想”。
    “工人日报”指出，“华盛顿、伦敦和马尼拉正在进行各种各样的阴谋以设法恢复帝国主义对印度尼西亚的控制”。
