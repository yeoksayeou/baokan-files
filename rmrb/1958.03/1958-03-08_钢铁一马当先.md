Editorial Remarks

    Steel Takes the Lead
    Construction is twice as fast, investment is halved, steel production reaches seven million tons, and iron production reaches eight million tons—these are the rich economic fruits of the double-anti movement in the steel industry, and this is a great and joyful news that excites the people of the whole country.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China once pointed out: The double-anti movement "is a socialist movement of great leap forward in production and culture, and it is a decisive movement to improve the work of the entire country and promote the great enthusiasm of the whole people in the national rectification campaign." As long as we grasp this guiding principle, "we can accomplish tens or even several times more undertakings than originally planned with the same number of people and the same financial and material resources." The leap forward of the steel industry vividly proves the estimate of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    The steel industry has already taken the lead; other industries and all other aspects of work in the country should also pick up the pace and leap forward again and again!

    钢铁一马当先
    建设快一倍，投资省一半，钢产七百万，铁产八百万——这是钢铁工业双反运动中丰硕的经济果实，这是振奋全国人心的一个大喜讯。
    中共中央曾经指出：双反运动“是一个社会主义的生产大跃进和文化大跃进的运动，是在全民整风运动中改进整个国家工作和促进全民大干劲的一个带有决定性的运动”。只要抓紧这条纲，“就可以用同样的人数和同样的财力、物力，办出比原定计划多百分之几十以至数以倍计的事业”。钢铁工业的跃进，鲜明地证实了中共中央的估计。
    钢铁工业已经一马当先了，其它工业和全国其它方面的工作，也应该快马加鞭，跃进又跃进！
