Socialist Countries' Fine Arts Exhibition
To be Held in Moscow at the End of the Year

    This newspaper reports that from March 19 to 20, a representative meeting of art groups from socialist countries was held in Moscow regarding the holding of a socialist countries' fine arts exhibition. Representatives from the art groups of Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Democratic Germany, China, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia participated in the meeting.

    After exchanging opinions, the meeting participants unanimously agreed that a socialist countries' fine arts exhibition must be held, and it was decided that the exhibition would open in December 1958 at the Central Exhibition Hall in Moscow.

    The meeting considered it appropriate to conduct creative discussions on the exhibited works during the exhibition period.

    The meeting proposed and adopted the regulations for the exhibition. The regulations stipulate that the exhibition should be organized based on the brotherly cooperation and fully equal rights of the participating countries. The exhibition can showcase oil paintings, sculptures, and prints (including traditional Chinese paintings) created by fine artists from socialist countries in the post-war era.

    The meeting participants hoped that this exhibition would become the beginning of regularly held international art exhibitions for the defense of world peace, and they hoped that the works of artists from more countries would be exhibited in future exhibitions.

    社会主义国家造型艺展
    年底在莫斯科举行
    本报讯　3月19—20日在莫斯科举行了社会主义国家美术团体关于举办社会主义国家造型艺术展览会的代表会议。参加会议的有阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、民主德国、中国、朝鲜、蒙古、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克等国美术团体的代表。
    会议参加者交换意见以后，一致认为必须举办一次社会主义国家造型艺术展览会，并商定在1958年12月开幕，展览地址在莫斯科的中央展览大厅。
    会议认为在展览会展出期间对展览作品能进行创作讨论，是合宜的。
    会议提出并通过了展览会的条例。规章指出，展览会应基于参加国的兄弟般合作和充分平等的权利来组织。展览会可以展出社会主义国家造型艺术家们在战后年代里创作的油画、雕塑和版画（包括国画）。
    会议参加者希望这次展览会成为为了保卫世界和平而定期举办的国际艺术展览会的开端，并希望有更多的国家的美术家的作品在今后的展览会上展出。
