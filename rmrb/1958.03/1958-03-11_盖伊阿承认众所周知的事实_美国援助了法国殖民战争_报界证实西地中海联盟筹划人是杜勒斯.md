Xinhua News Agency, March 10th, Paris Dispatch: French Prime Minister Guy Mollet stated again on the 9th that France would never abandon its colonial rule over Algeria.

At a banquet for Radical Socialist Party members in Chartres, Guy Mollet described Algeria as the "umbilical cord" between France and Africa. He said that if Algeria were lost, France would "die in shock."

He revealed that France was actually conducting the Algerian colonial war with the assistance of the United States. In this regard, he pointed out that the United States, as well as the International Monetary Fund influenced by the United States, had recently given France a large sum of money to ease France's financial crisis, and that the United States, which controlled the majority of the United Nations General Assembly, had also twice "refused to debate the Algerian issue, thereby tacitly agreeing to the policies we are pursuing in Algeria."

Guy Mollet stated that in addition to conducting "military struggles" in Algeria, France must also conduct "political struggles." He demanded that elections be held in Algeria by the end of this year according to the Algerian "Basic Law" drafted by France.

Guy Mollet also briefly mentioned the issue of concluding a "Western Mediterranean Pact."

Western newspapers and news agencies confirmed that the proposal to conclude a Western Mediterranean military alliance was originally put forward by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles in a secret letter to British Foreign Secretary Lloyd at the end of last month. Dulles suggested establishing a "Western Mediterranean Federation" including France, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Libya in order to "politically stabilize" the region and conclude a military alliance including the United States and Britain on this basis. The Americans believe that this alliance "should promote" the resolution of the Algerian issue and the disputes between France and Tunisia and Morocco. However, France insisted that Algeria can only participate in this alliance as a French territory. It was revealed that in order to induce Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya to make concessions on the issue of Algerian independence, France had promised to allow these countries to obtain some benefits in the exploitation of the rich Saharan oil.

    盖伊阿承认众所周知的事实
    美国援助了法国殖民战争
    报界证实西地中海联盟筹划人是杜勒斯
    据新华社10日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理盖伊阿9日再一次表示，法国绝不肯放弃他对阿尔及利亚的殖民统治。
    盖伊阿在夏特尔地方激进社会党人的宴会上，把阿尔及利亚说成是法国和非洲之间的“脐带”。他说，如果失去了阿尔及利亚，法国就要“受震荡而死”。
    他透露，法国其实是在美国的援助下进行阿尔及利亚殖民战争的。在这方面，他指出，美国以及受美国影响的国际货币基金组织最近曾经给法国大笔钱来缓和法国的财政危机，而美国控制了多数的联合国大会也曾经两次“拒绝就阿尔及利亚问题进行辩论，从而默默地同意我们正在阿尔及利亚奉行的政策”。
    盖伊阿表示，法国除了在阿尔及利亚进行“军事斗争”外，还要进行“政治斗争”。他要求在今年年底以前根据法国拟订的阿尔及利亚“根本法”在阿尔及利亚举行选举。
    盖伊阿还简单地提到缔结“西地中海公约”的问题。
    西方报纸和通讯社证实，关于缔结西地中海军事联盟的建议，原来是美国国务卿杜勒斯在上月月底给英国外交大臣劳埃德的一封密信中提出的。杜勒斯建议建立一个包括法国、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥和利比亚在内的“西地中海联邦”，以便“在政治上稳定”这个地区，并且在这个基础上缔结包括美国和英国在内的军事联盟。美国人认为，这个联盟“应该促进”阿尔及利亚问题以及法国同突尼斯、摩洛哥之间的纠纷的解决。但是法国坚持阿尔及利亚只能作为法国的领土来参加这个联盟。据透露，法国为了诱使摩洛哥、突尼斯和利比亚在阿尔及利亚独立的问题上让步，曾经答应让这些国家在开采富饶的撒哈拉石油方面可以得到一些好处。
