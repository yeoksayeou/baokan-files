Xiaogan, Leap Forward Again!
By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin

"Surpass Chenghai, Battle Liling"

Leaving Xiaogan Railway Station and heading towards Chezhan (Station) Township, I saw slogans written on whitewashed walls and at the entrances: "Surpass Chenghai, Battle Liling," or "Stride Forward with Heroic Steps, Surpass Chenghai; Summon Revolutionary Zeal, Battle Liling." I didn't quite understand the meaning, so I asked someone nearby and learned that it expressed grand ambitions for the Great Leap Forward in production. Upon arriving at Chezhan Township—the location of the Xiaogan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party office—I met Wang Zhenming, the First Secretary of the County Committee. When I asked about the origin of this slogan, he smiled and said, "It was put forward to oppose conservatism and compare enthusiasm." He invited me to sit by the stove, lit a cigarette, and continued:

"In 1956, the average grain yield per mu in our county was 859 jin. In 1957, it increased to 1,003 jin. This year, we aimed to reach 1,200 jin, and at the time, we felt this target was quite advanced. However, last year, neighboring counties with a grain yield of over 800 jin challenged us, proposing a yield of 1,000 to 1,100 jin per mu. Provinces outside also challenged us. Chenghai County in Guangdong Province proposed increasing their grain yield per mu from 1,270 jin last year to 1,628 jin this year; Liling County in Hunan Province proposed increasing their grain yield per mu from 802 jin last year to 1,500 jin this year. In this way, counties that were inferior to us last year are now aiming to catch up or surpass us this year. What's so advanced about our target? We're launching another leap forward—'Surpass Chenghai, Battle Liling' is our battle cry. Encouraged by this slogan, we raised the grain target from 1,200 jin to 1,500 jin."

Xiaogan County has over 800,000 mu of rice paddy, and aiming for 1,500 jin per mu is not a simple matter. But Wang Zhenming said they had a basis for setting this target. In 1957, over 2,500 mu of land in the county had already achieved a yield of 2,000 to 2,953 jin per mu. They systematically summarized the experiences of these high-yield models. Now they have put forward a slogan: "Use the measures for 2,000 jin to lead the effort for 1,500 jin."

I talked to Wang Zhenming about the masses' opinions on achieving this target. He said that when the target was presented to the masses for discussion, they had just returned from visiting advanced areas such as Macheng, Hongan, and Jun County, and their revolutionary zeal was even greater than that of the County Committee. After tapping potential, carefully calculating, and conducting debates, most communes proposed targets of 1,700 or 1,800 jin. Among the six townships in Pengxing District, five townships proposed targets of 2,000 to 2,200 jin. This enthusiasm of the masses increased the County Committee's confidence in achieving the 1,500 jin target.

New Developments in Experimental Fields

Here, experimental fields are developing in a new direction—from small-scale experiments to large-area experiments, which people call "experimental paddies." Each paddy ranges from dozens of mu to hundreds or even thousands of mu. The experimental paddies that have appeared throughout the county account for over 100,000 mu of land. Generally, the experimental paddies aim for a grain yield of 2,000 jin per mu, with some aiming for 2,400 jin or more. With the assistance of the Xiaogan Prefectural Committee, the County Committee and cadres at all levels are planning to create a high-yield demonstration area of 200,000 mu of contiguous land with a grain yield of 2,000 jin per mu.

This bold attempt was proposed based on their summary of the experiences of experimental fields. Last year, over 50,000 mu of experimental fields were planted throughout the county, with a general yield of nearly 2,000 jin and some exceeding 2,000 jin. They reasoned that if small-scale experimental fields could increase yields, could not large-scale fields with the same conditions also increase yields? They studied the natural conditions and work foundation of the Pengxing, Wolong, and Longdian Districts, summarized the experiences of the high-yield fields in these three districts, and decided to connect the 200,000 mu of land in the three districts to establish a high-yield demonstration area, centered on planting experimental fields, to create a large-area balanced increase in yield of 2,000 jin per mu.

The Prefectural Committee and County Committee leaders told me that their measures to achieve a yield of 2,000 jin per mu are: apply an average of 800-900 dan of fertilizer per mu (equivalent to the quality of 500 jin of cake fertilizer), deep plow to a depth of four to five cun, and densely plant 30,000-40,000 rice plants per mu. In addition, expand the area of multiple cropping, implement the use of improved varieties, and use double-wheel, double-share plows, etc. They also mentioned that because the area of the experimental fields is large and the variety of crops planted is diverse, the leadership can gain rich technical and leadership experience. They have now established a high-yield demonstration area management committee and a comprehensive technology experimental station, headed by the First Secretaries of the Prefectural Committee, County Committee, and District Committees, and leadership organizations have also been established in the districts and townships.

The masses in the three districts are very excited about the emergence of the high-yield demonstration area and have signed their names asking to include the land of their communes in the demonstration area. They are now tapping production potential and formulating plans.

According to estimates by the County Committee leaders, after the 100,000 mu of experimental paddies and high-yield demonstration area in the county achieve a grain yield of 2,000 jin per mu this year, there is great hope that the entire county will achieve a grain yield of 2,000 jin per mu next year.

Improving Leadership Methods

To adapt to the Great Leap Forward in production, the County Committee's leadership methods have undergone many improvements.

In the past, some County Committees did not work in a fixed area and lacked a strong sense of responsibility. Regardless of whether there were problems, they would leave after the work was arranged. Now, the seven secretaries of the Secretariat divide the twelve districts of the county into areas of responsibility, and each County Committee member is responsible for one district, and so on down the line, with each level responsible for the entire year.

In the areas of responsibility assigned to the secretaries, the principle of "combining division of responsibility with specialization" is also implemented. The County Committee stipulates that the secretary responsible for each area must not only take charge of the overall work, but also conduct relatively in-depth and thorough research on the main crops in that area, and systematically propose various measures for that crop at the County Committee meeting. Recently, they studied the issues of deep plowing and dense planting of rice, with good results.

The working methods of Wang Zhenming, the First Secretary who oversees the overall situation, have also changed accordingly. In the past, he mainly arranged work based on reports from the office, which were relatively general and could not keep up with the pace of guiding the work. Now, he draws six people from the office to work in Chezhan Township, a key area for work, and often goes out with everyone to understand the situation in the twelve communes of the township. After thoroughly understanding the situation in one township, he exchanges opinions with the heads of the districts (all of whom are members of the County Committee), and the situation in the entire county is roughly grasped, so the leadership work is very accurate and timely.

"Informants" are another improvement in leadership methods. Since last winter, more than ten provinces (including this province) and 30,000 to 40,000 cadres from all over the country have come here to visit. Therefore, the County Committee decided to send out informants to learn about the situation and learn from the experience of advanced areas. Recently, Xiaogan County has sent people to Liling County in Hunan Province and Zhejiang Province to learn about rice yield increase experiences. With the spring plowing season approaching, the informants are even more active, going to other counties to learn about the current production actions and experiences, which has greatly promoted the preparatory work for spring plowing.

    孝感，跃进再跃进！
    本报记者　古维进
    “猛追澄海，大战醴陵”
    出了孝感火车站，向着车站乡走去。只见一路上的粉垣和大门口写着这样的口号：“猛追澄海，大战醴陵”，或者是：“迈开英雄步伐，猛追澄海；鼓足革命干劲，大战醴陵。”我不大了解它的意思，向旁人打听，才知道是表达生产大跃进的豪语。到了车站乡——中共孝感县委办公室所在地——碰见县委第一书记王振明，问起这个口号的来历，他笑笑地说：“这是反保守，比干劲，提出来的。”他邀我坐在炉火旁边，点起一根纸烟，继续说：
  “1956年，我们全县的粮食平均亩产八百五十九斤，1957年提高到一千零三斤，今年又要求达到一千二百斤，当时我们感到这个指标相当先进了。但是，去年粮食亩产八百多斤的周围兄弟县和我们挑战，提出亩产一千到一千一百多斤。外省也有和我们挑战的，广东澄海县提出粮食亩产量由去年一千二百七十斤提高到今年的一千六百二十八斤；湖南醴陵县提出粮食亩产由去年八百零二斤提高到今年的一千五百斤。这一来，去年不如自己的县，今年都要赶上或超过自己了，自己的指标还先进什么？我们再来一个跃进——‘猛追澄海，大战醴陵’就是我们的战斗口号。在这个口号的鼓舞下，把粮食指标由一千二百斤提高到一千五百斤。”
    孝感县有八十多万亩水稻，要求亩产一千五百斤不是一件简单的事情。但是王振明说，他们提出这个指标是有根据的。1957年，全县有二千五百多亩田已经达到亩产二千到二千九百五十三斤，他们系统地总结了这些高产典型的经验。现在他们提出一个口号：“用二千斤的措施去领导一千五百斤。”
    我和王振明谈到群众对于实现这个指标的意见。他说，当指标拿给群众讨论的时候，群众正好从麻城、红安、均县等先进地区参观回来，革命干劲比县委还大；经过挖潜力，算细账，开展辩论，一般的社都提出一千七、八百斤的指标，朋兴区六个乡中，便有五个乡提出二千到二千二百斤的指标。群众的这股干劲，使县委增加了实现一千五百斤指标的把握。
    试验田的新发展
    在这里，试验田正在向着新的方向发展——由小块试验变为大面积试验，也就是人们说的试验畈。每畈少则数十亩，多则数百亩至数千亩。全县出现的试验畈约占土地十余万亩。一般的试验畈都要求粮食亩产二千斤，多的达二千四百斤以上。在孝感地委的协助下，县委和各级干部要搞一个二十万亩土地连成一片的亩产粮食二千斤的高额丰产示范区。
    这个大胆的尝试，是他们总结了试验田的经验提出的。去年全县种植试验田五千万多亩，一般的产量将近二千斤，多的达二千余斤。他们考虑，既然小块试验田可以提高产量，难道条件相同的大块田就不能提高产量吗？他们研究了朋兴、卧龙、龙店三个区的自然条件和工作基础，总结了这三个区的高额丰产田的经验，决定把三个区的二十万亩土地连成一片，建立高额丰产示范区，以种植试验田为中心，创造亩产二千斤的大面积平衡增产。
    地委和县委负责人告诉我，他们实现亩产二千斤的措施是：每亩田平均施肥八、九百担（相当于五百斤饼肥的质量），深耕四—五寸，每亩水稻密植到三、四万株；此外，扩大复种面积，实行良种化，双轮双铧犁化等。他们还谈到，由于试验田面积大，种植作物的品种多，领导上可以取得丰富的技术经验和领导经验。现在他们已经以地委、县委、区委的第一书记为首，组织各方面的力量，成立了高额丰产示范区管理委员会和综合技术试验站，各区、乡也成立了领导机构。
    三个区的群众，对于高额丰产示范区的出现，非常兴奋，纷纷签名要求把自己社里的土地参加示范区。现在他们正在挖掘生产潜力，制定规划。
    据县委负责人估计，今年全县的十余万亩试验畈和高额丰产示范区实现粮食亩产二千斤以后，明年全县实现粮食亩产二千斤大有希望。
    改进领导方法
    为了适应生产大跃进，县委的领导方法，作了许多改进。
    过去，有些县委没有固定在一个地区工作，责任心不强。不管有无问题，工作布置完毕就走。现在书记处七个书记，把全县十二个区分片包干，县委委员每人包干一个区，区以下也层层包干，全年负责到底。
    在书记们分片包干的地区，还实行了“分片分业相结合”。县委规定，负责每个片的书记，除了把全面工作抓起来，必须对该片的主要作物进行比较深刻、透彻的研究，并在县委会上系统地提出对该作物的各种措施。最近，他们研究了水稻的深耕、密植等问题，效果良好。
    掌握全面的第一书记王振明的工作方法也相应地有了改变。过去，他主要是根据办公室的汇报材料布置工作，这些材料比较一般化，指导工作赶不上。现在他从办公室抽出六个人到工作重点车站乡办公，经常和大家分头到全乡十二个社了解情况，把一个乡的情况摸透之后，再和各区负责人（都是县委）交换意见，全县的情况就大致掌握起来，于是领导工作非常准确、及时。
    “情报员”，又是一种领导方法的改进。从去冬至今，全国各地先后来这里参观的有十余个省（包括本省）、三四万干部。于是县委决定派出情报员，到先进地区了解情况，学习经验。最近，孝感县已经派人到湖南醴陵县和浙江等地了解水稻增产经验。目前春耕快到，情报员更为活跃，纷纷到外县了解当前的生产行动和经验，这对于推动备耕工作起了很大作用。
