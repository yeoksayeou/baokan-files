Beijing Electronic Tube Factory Workers Discuss "Laboring for Whom"
Uprooting Waste and Conservatism

(Reported by this newspaper) The workers of the Beijing Electronic Tube Factory, in order to dig out the ideological roots of waste and conservatism, launched a heated discussion around the question of "laboring for whom."

Before the anti-waste campaign, the waste phenomenon in this factory was alarming. In just over a year, 270,000 electronic tubes and 320,000 core pillars were scrapped. Workers commonly wasted raw materials. Dong Shumin, a worker in Workshop No. 10, casually left his work station during production, causing five kilograms of thorium nitrate to leak. With less than one kilogram remaining after the leak, he simply threw it all away, resulting in a loss of more than 9,000 yuan. Those present were not only not distressed, but instead said, "If it leaks and is thrown away, so be it. Anyway, it's not worth a few pairs of leather shoes." In terms of welfare, everything had to be new, beautiful, and comfortable, and they would complain if their demands were not met. They said, "Our factory is a modern large factory, and life must also be modernized." Many workers had lax labor discipline and were casually late or left early. Among the technical personnel, the pursuit of personal fame and gain was very serious. Some put aside their work to translate books in order to become famous and earn royalties. Some veteran cadres were perfunctory in their work and unwilling to use their brains. They simply repeated what the higher-ups instructed. When giving reports, they had others write their speeches and read them verbatim.

Since the rectification campaign, especially after the launch of the anti-waste campaign, the situation has changed greatly. The masses not only have a completely new look in terms of cherishing state property, but also have a great deal of enthusiasm for production, and new records are constantly emerging. The enthusiasm of technical personnel and cadres has also greatly improved.

After analyzing this situation, the Party Committee of the Electronic Tube Factory believed that the high morale of the workers was sparked by the influence of the national situation, and if the fundamental problems were not solved ideologically, this enthusiasm would be difficult to sustain. Therefore, they raised the fundamental question of "laboring for whom" and organized all factory workers to conduct extensive discussions.

From the discussion, it appeared that the question of laboring for whom had not been well resolved among many workers and some cadres. For example, some workers said that they were laboring for "three-memberships": first, they wanted to become technicians; second, they wanted to become Party members; and third, they wanted to raise their salaries to 100 yuan. Some workers said, "I have never thought about the question of laboring for whom. I do what others do. But it's okay for me to complete my own tasks, but I can't help others." Some veteran workers said, "In the past, I always felt that my labor was 50% for socialism and 50% for myself. Now it seems to be '30-70.' After buying a bicycle, I wanted a wristwatch, and after getting a wristwatch, I wanted a radio. My mind was full of these personal matters all day long, and naturally, I thought less about production." Some comrades who had participated in the revolution for a relatively long time also made self-criticisms. Some said, "In recent years, I have always wanted to make my small family more comfortable. At work, it's just going to work and getting off work every day for eight hours. When criticizing the shortcomings of others, I also beat around the bush." Others examined themselves: "In recent years, living conditions have improved, wages are not low, children are numerous, and I am getting older, giving me a sense of 'stopping here.' That energetic spirit has gradually disappeared."

This great discussion on laboring for whom and great ideological examination swept through all workshops and departments, from the factory director, Party secretary, and chief engineer to the cooks and odd-job workers. Everyone boldly exposed their thoughts and earnestly conducted criticism and self-criticism. Through this discussion, everyone recognized the relationship between the individual and the country and realized that their labor was for building a prosperous and strong socialist motherland. As a result, the enthusiasm for surpassing the advanced was even greater. The idea of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, with more, faster, better, and more economical results, took root in the enterprise. If anyone dropped a small piece of mica and didn't pick it up, others would warn him. In the past, work clothes were hired to be washed, but this time the masses voluntarily offered to wash them themselves. In the past, ventilation workers had nothing to do in the winter, and when the leadership asked them to do some rough work, they said, "We are technical workers, how can we do rough work!" This time, they voluntarily offered to do ventilation in the summer and burn boilers in the winter. The technical workers in Workshop No. 22, whose work tasks were insufficient, took over all the miscellaneous tasks that the capital construction section had previously hired temporary workers to do, and also planned to plant vegetables on all 30 mu of open space in the factory area. In terms of living supplies, "seven no's" were proposed, making full use of old items and not receiving new work clothes, new gloves, new masks, or new towels. Cadres and technical personnel were in high spirits, and their energetic spirit was rekindled.

### 北京电子管厂职工讨论“为谁劳动”  把浪费保守连根拔掉

    北京电子管厂职工讨论“为谁劳动”
    把浪费保守连根拔掉
    本报讯　北京电子管厂职工为了挖掘浪费和保守的思想根源，围绕着“为谁劳动”的问题展开了热烈讨论。
    在反浪费运动以前，这个厂的浪费现象是惊人的。一年多的时间就报废了二十七万支电子管，三十二万只芯柱。工人中随便糟踏原材料的情况很普遍。十号车间工人董淑敏，生产时间随便离开工作岗位，使五公斤硝酸钍漏掉了，漏剩了不到一公斤，也索性全部倒了，一共损失了九千多元。在场的人不仅不心痛，相反地却说：“漏了倒了就算了，反正值不了几双皮鞋钱。”在福利方面，什么都要新要漂亮要舒适，不达目的就发牢骚讲怪话。他们说：“咱们厂是个近代化的大工厂，生活也得近代化。”不少工人劳动纪律松弛、随便迟到早退。技术人员中间追求个人名利的思想十分严重。有人放下工作不干去翻译书，以图成名和赚稿费。有些老干部工作上得过且过，不愿动脑筋。上面布置什么，回厂来照说一遍。作报告要别人写好讲稿，照本宣读。
    整风以来，特别是反浪费运动开展以后，情况大变。群众不仅在爱护国家财产方面面目一新，而且生产干劲很足，新纪录不断涌现。技术人员和干部的干劲也有了很大的起色。
    电子管厂党委会分析了这个情况后，认为：职工这种高涨的情绪，是在全国形势的影响下掀起来的，如果不从思想上解决根本问题，这种热情将难以持久。于是，他们就提出了“为谁劳动”这个根本性的问题，组织全厂职工进行广泛的讨论。
    从讨论的情况看来，为谁劳动的问题，在许多工人和部分干部中都没有很好解决。如有的工人说自己是了为了“三员”而劳动的：一想当技术员，二想做党员，三想把工资升到一百元。有的工人说：“我从来没想过为谁劳动的问题。人家干我也干。可是叫我自己完成任务可以，要我帮助别人可不行。”有的老工人说：“过去总觉得自己为社会主义为个人各占50％。现在看来是‘倒三七’，买了自行车想块手表，有了手表又想收音机，整天脑子里尽盘算这些个人的私事，生产上的事自然就想得少了。”一些参加革命比较长的同志也都作了自我批评。有的说：“这几年来总想把自己的小家庭弄得舒适些，工作上是上班下班每天八小时。对待别人的缺点，批评起来也是转弯抹角的。”也有人检查：“这几年来生活改善了，工资也不低，孩子成群，年纪也大起来了，大有‘就此止步’之概，那种生龙活虎的劲儿就日渐消失了。”
    这场为谁劳动的大讨论和思想大检查，席卷了各个车间和科室，上至厂长、党委书记、总工程师，下至炊事员、勤杂工，每个人都大胆暴露思想，认真进行批评和自我批评。经过这场讨论，大家认清了个人和国家的关系，认识到自己的劳动是为了建设又富又强的社会主义祖国。于是，比先进的劲头更大了。勤俭办企业，多快好省的思想在企业里扎下了根。如果谁丢了一小片云母不拣起来，别人就会警告他。过去，工作服是雇人洗的，这次群众自动提出自己洗。过去通风工人冬天就没事干，领导上叫他们干些粗活，他们说：“我们是技术工人，哪能干粗活！”这次，他们自动提出夏天搞通风，冬天烧锅炉。二十二号车间工作任务不足的技术工人把基建科过去雇临时工干的杂活全部包了下来，还要把厂区内的三十亩空地全种上蔬菜。在生活用品方面，提出了“七不要”，充分利用旧的，不领新工作服、新手套、新口罩、新毛巾。干部和技术人员精神焕发，生龙活虎的劲儿都重新鼓了起来。
