Notes

    Slapped in the Face
    The British Labour Party's newspaper, the "Daily Herald," recently argued in its editorials that Britain should stop manufacturing and testing hydrogen bombs and oppose the United States establishing missile bases in Britain. The Labour Party's secretary, Morgan Phillips, accused the "Daily Herald" of "undermining" the Labour Party for this position.
    The "Daily Herald" publicly disclosed Phillips' letter criticizing the paper, and also added an editor's note. In the editor's note, the "Daily Herald's" editors retorted that the paper's position "reflects the opinions of a growing number of people across the country," and therefore it "does not seek to undermine the Labour movement but to make it more powerful."
    It seems that it will not be the "Daily Herald" that is disgraced in this dispute, but certainly the Labour Party's secretary. It is ridiculous that Phillips originally wanted to use the power of the Labour Party's secretary to suppress the newspaper belonging to the party, but instead received a slap in the face. This is not only a personal tragedy for Phillips, but also a tragedy for the entire right-wing leadership group of the Labour Party.

    挨了耳光
    英国工党的报纸“每日先驱报”最近在它的言论中，主张英国停止制造和试验氢弹，并且反对美国在英国建立火箭基地。“每日先驱报”的这种主张，受到了英国工党书记摩根·菲利普的指责，说这“是在破坏”工党。
    “每日先驱报”把菲利普指责该报的信件公开披露了，并且还加了按语。在按语中，“每日先驱报”的编者反驳说，该报的主张“反映了全国越来越多的人的意见”，因而它“不是要破坏劳工运动而是要它更加有力”。
    看来，在这场争论中丢丑的将不是“每日先驱报”，而一定会是工党的那位书记。可笑的是菲利普原想用工党书记的权力来压制属于这个党的报纸的，结果反而挨了一记耳光。这不仅是菲利普个人的悲剧，而且也是工党整个右翼领导集团的悲剧。
