    Ayishaimu and Xiangzi
    Li Zhihua

    After seeing the plays "At the Foot of the Tianshan Mountains" and "Rickshaw Boy," I couldn't close my eyes without the protagonists flashing before me. The shadows of Xiangzi and Ayishaimu (the female protagonist of "At the Foot of the Tianshan Mountains") brought a series of life associations, and I couldn't calm down for a long time.

    The image of Xiangzi, an early Beijing rickshaw puller, reminded me of his companions: those old men wearing ragged military uniforms and torn women's jackets, with no collars or sleeves, their heads drooping lower than their spines, their arms on the handlebars, ready to "lose their balance"; those children with narrow chests, thin calves, and pieces of rags around their waists; they pulled broken rickshaws covered with tax tickets, running forward with their heads down, suddenly stopping at the city gate, putting down their rickshaws, and going to the "toll booth" to pay the tax… For the meager income of five coppers, how many skinny hands, how many hungry eyes, how many pleading mouths surrounded a "customer."

    As for those who rode in the rickshaws, apart from a few, most were wealthy people, like the young master Wu Zuguang. They came from mansions and government offices to go to restaurants and brothels, always ordering Xiangzi and others to pull them, and it wouldn't do if they were slow. Their opium consumption for one night was enough for Xiangzi and others to have food for half a month.

    That cannibalistic society, with its copper tickets, Citibank notes, old man bills, legal tender, and customs gold, is gone forever. Today's Xiangzis have stood up. Some continue to pedal tricycles, but they are neatly dressed, riding as masters on Beijing's clean and wide roads. They travel back and forth to hospitals to pick up patients, to railway stations to pick up passengers, transporting scientific instruments, educational books, and industrial and agricultural products. The fruits they pull from the fruit market may be the apples, grapes, and cantaloupes produced by Ayishaimu's agricultural cooperative! I seem to see Ayishaimu representing the Uyghur agricultural cooperative members far away at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, proposing a letter of initiative to the Xiangzis in Beijing—"Our cooperative will produce so many tens of thousands of pounds of fruit this year." And Xiangzi is also discussing with his partners how to improve the transportation volume targets and compete with "Ayishaimu."

    In the past, Xiangzi loved his rickshaw like his life, but in that cannibalistic society, could he even keep a rickshaw? This is made clear in Comrade Lao She's original work. Today, our "Ayishaimu" loves trees like her life, but this is different. What she loves is the socialist construction cause. When we see her protecting that tree with her own body, who can not feel that she is defending the socialist construction cause?

    Ayishaimu's heroic act of protecting trees is also related to the Xiangzis. Because from wood, we think of industry, of the electrification of vehicles; of a better future for the Xiangzis.

    These associations may be too far-fetched, but life itself is a long river, and my thoughts unconsciously drift so far along with it.

    Art, especially drama, has such a benefit: it can vividly present things from many years ago (such as "Rickshaw Boy") or things from tens of thousands of miles away (such as "At the Foot of the Tianshan Mountains") before our eyes. It breaks the isolation of time and space, brings us closer to life, guides us to think about life, and reminds us to further understand the meaning of work and labor. For this, I thank the creators of "Rickshaw Boy" and "At the Foot of the Tianshan Mountains" for their hard work.

    阿衣夏姆和祥子
    李之华
    看了“天山脚下”和“骆驼祥子”两出戏以后，一闭上眼，剧中主人公总是在面前闪来闪去，祥子和阿衣夏姆（“天山脚下”的女主人公）的影子，带来了一连串的生活联想，心情上好久不能平静下来。
    祥子这个早年北京人力车工人的形象，使我想起他的伙伴儿：那些穿着破军衣，破女袄，既没领子又没袖子，脑袋垂得比脊梁还低，胳膊驾着车把，随时都可能“打天秤”的老头儿；那些胸脯儿很窄，小腿儿精细，腰下围着几片破布的小孩儿；他们拉着贴满车捐票儿的破车，低着头往前奔跑着，跑到城门脸儿一齐“乍住”，搁下车，跑到“卡子”那儿去上捐……为了五个大子儿的苦买卖，多少只瘦骨嶙峋的手，多少对饥饿的眼睛，多少张哀求的嘴，围着一个“坐儿”。
    至于那些坐车的呢，除了少数，大半都是阔人，比如像吴祖光少爷之流。他们从公馆，衙门出来去到酒楼妓院，都是叫祥子们拉着跑，慢了还不成。他们一晚上的鸦片烟，就够祥子们半个月的“嚼谷”。
    那个人吃人的社会，随着铜子票儿，花旗票儿，老头票儿，法币，关金，永远一去不复返了。今天的祥子们已经站立起来。有人继续蹬着三轮儿，但他们穿着整齐，以主人翁的姿态驰骋在北京清洁宽广的马路上。他们往返医院接送病人，去火车站接旅客，拉科学仪器，教育图书，工农业产品。他们从果子市场拉来的水果，也许就是阿衣夏姆农业社生产出来的苹果，葡萄，哈蜜瓜！我好像看见阿衣夏姆代表远在天山脚下的维吾尔族农业社员们，向北京的祥子们提出倡议书——“我们社里今年要生产多少万斤水果”。而祥子也在同他的伙伴儿商量，如何提高运输量的指标，和“阿衣夏姆”竞赛。
    当年祥子曾经爱车如命，但在那个人吃人的社会，即使有一辆车子还能保得住吗？这在老舍同志的原著里已经说得清清楚楚了。今天我们的“阿衣夏姆”爱树如命，但这是不同的，她爱的是社会主义的建设事业，当我们看到她用自己的身体保护那棵树的时候，谁能不觉得她是在保卫社会主义建设事业呢？
    阿衣夏姆保护树木的英勇行为和祥子们也是有关的。因为从木材，想到工业，想到车辆的电气化；想到祥子们更美好的将来。
    这些联想也许太远了，但生活本身就是一条长河，使我的思想不知不觉随着它飘流了这么远。
    艺术，特别是戏剧，就有这么个好处，它能把许多年前的事情（如“骆驼祥子”）或万里以外的事情（如“天山脚下”）活生生的摆在我们的面前，它打破了时间和地域的隔绝，使我们接近生活，引导我们对生活进行思索，提醒我们进一步认识工作和劳动的意义，为此，我感谢“骆驼祥子”和“天山脚下”创造者们的辛勤劳动。
