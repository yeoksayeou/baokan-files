    Raising Two Hundred Million to Vigorously Develop Local Industry
    Jiangxi Province has decided to immediately launch a high tide of the "Double-Anti" movement throughout the province, with the main content being the exploration of potential financial, material, and human resources.

    Nanchang Dispatch from our newspaper, March 26th: The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to immediately launch a high tide of the "Double-Anti" movement throughout the province, with the important content being the exploration of potential financial, material, and human resources. They will further mobilize the masses to raise two hundred million yuan of funds from the province's local fiscal budget and the budgets of party and government organs, institutions, and enterprises for investment in local industrial construction, and transfer a group of cadres to strengthen the local industrial front.

    The commercial system, the Water Conservancy and Electric Power Department, the Agricultural, Forestry, and Reclamation Department, and the Agricultural Department of Jiangxi Province have already taken action. The commercial system has discussed and obtained the approval of the Provincial Party Committee to merge the First Commercial Department, the Second Commercial Department (formerly the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Service Department, merged and renamed), and the Foreign Trade Bureau into one institution. They will draw one hundred thousand cadres from the existing commercial personnel in the province, raise twenty million yuan of funds, and organize more than thirty types of processing industries throughout the province, such as feather processing, food processing, short-staple fiber stripping, sugar making, and crude tea making. The Water Conservancy and Electric Power Department has raised 25 million yuan of funds, which will be used to build power stations and repair plants. The Agricultural, Forestry, and Reclamation Department and the Agricultural Department have also held meetings to review plans, clear warehouses, and raise funds to establish agricultural machinery and fertilizer manufacturing factories.

    This newspaper reports: On March 23, Jiangxi Daily published an editorial entitled "Raising Two Hundred Million to Run Industry and Support Agriculture." The editorial said: The question of whether local industry should and can make a great leap forward has been basically resolved; now it is necessary to further boost our energy, strive for the upstream, and strive to achieve the original plan ahead of schedule.

    To achieve a great leap forward in industry and agriculture, there must be a certain amount of funds. The main source of funds depends on ourselves, on fully mobilizing the masses, and on tapping various potentials.

    The Provincial Party Committee recently proposed to tap two hundred million yuan from all aspects of the province's finances and idle social funds to build forty-one fertilizer plants, fifteen higher-grade medium-sized cement plants, and conditional counties to build a low-grade small cement plant per county, two hundred small power stations, and, where there are iron ore deposits, various types of small blast furnaces can be built, and various small factories and mines can be established according to the specific conditions of local resources. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee has decided to fully tap financial, material, and human resources as an important part of the current "Double-Anti" movement in our province, and guarantee that the expected requirements are met through the movement. The editorial said that this money will not be used centrally by the province, but will be raised and used by local governments. Various small and medium-sized industries serving agriculture, as long as counties can and are able to run them, should be actively established with the county as the center. All organs, enterprises, and schools are required to save all the money that can be left unused or delayed for industrial investment, even if it is only a penny. All surplus cadres should be transferred to engage in industrial construction, even if it is only one person. Cadres and workers should be encouraged to deposit their surplus money in banks for long-term savings, and agricultural cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and cooperative shops are welcome to voluntarily invest their surplus public accumulation funds to jointly support local industrial construction.

    集资二亿大办地方工业
    江西省决定立即在全省范围内掀起一个以挖掘潜在财力、物力、人力为主要内容的双反运动高潮。
    本报南昌26日电　中共江西省委决定立即在全省范围内掀起一个以挖掘潜在财力、物力、人力为重要内容的双反运动高潮，进一步发动群众，从全省地方财政预算及党政机关和事业、企业部门的预算中，筹集两亿元资金投入地方工业建设，并抽调一批干部加强地方工业战线。
    江西省商业系统和水利电力厅、农林垦殖厅、农业厅，已经行动起来。商业系统已议定并经省委批准，将第一商业厅、第二商业厅（原省供销社、服务厅合并改称）和对外贸易局合并成一个机构，在全省现有商业人员中抽出一万名干部，集资两千万元，在全省各地举办羽毛加工、食品加工、短绒剥制、制糖、粗制茶叶等三十余个类型的加工工业。水利电力厅已经筹集了二千五百万元资金，准备用于举办发电站和修配厂。农林垦殖厅和农业厅也纷纷开会审查计划、清理仓库，集资兴办农业机械和肥料制造等工厂。　（刘光辉）
    本报讯　3月23日，江西日报以“集资两亿，举办工业、支援农业”为题，发表社论。社论说：地方工业应该不应该大跃进、能不能大跃进的问题，基本上已经解决了；现在是进一步鼓足干劲，力争上游，争取提前实现原定计划。
    实现工农业大跃进，必须有一定的资金。资金来源主要依靠自己，依靠充分发动群众，挖掘各种潜力。
    省委最近提出，要从全省各方财政和社会闲散资金等方面挖掘两亿元，以最快的速度建设四十一个化肥厂，十五个较高标号的中型水泥厂，有条件的县，每县可以建设一个低标号的小型水泥厂，二百个小型发电站，有铁矿的地方，可建各种类型的小高炉，还可以根据本地资源的具体情况，兴办各种小型的厂矿。所以省委决定，把充分挖掘财力、物力、人力当做目前我省双反运动的重要内容，并通过运动保证达到预期的要求。社论说，这笔钱省里不集中使用，各地自筹自用。各种为农业服务的中小型工业，只要各县可以办和能够办的，都应该以县为中心积极兴办。要求一切机关、企业、学校，把所有可以不用或缓用的钱都节省下来做工业投资，那怕是一文钱。把所有多余的干部抽调出来从事工业建设，那怕是一个人。要鼓励干部和职工把自己多余的钱向银行长期储蓄，欢迎农业合作社、手工业合作社、合作商店把多余的公积金自愿地投资，大家共同来支援地方工业建设。
