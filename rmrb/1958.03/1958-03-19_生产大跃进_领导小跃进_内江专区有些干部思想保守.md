Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: The head of the CPC Sichuan Neijiang Prefectural Committee recently returned from inspecting spring plowing and production with the county party secretaries of various counties. He told Xinhua reporters that the problem of many cadres' leadership methods not keeping up with the new situation should be given great attention.

The leader said that during this half-month inspection, he saw that after the rectification movement, the thinking style and leadership methods of cadres at all levels had indeed undergone great changes, and spring planting in the entire region was completed a month earlier than last year. In many areas, the progress was fast and the quality was high. However, the leadership methods of a considerable number of cadres have not been thoroughly changed. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, they adopted a "small leap forward" leadership method. On the surface, it seems that they are also leaping forward; production results are greater than in previous years, and leadership methods are better than in previous years. However, their "leap forward" is mostly forced by the situation, and many old concepts have not been broken. Therefore, the pace of the leap forward always lags behind the development of the situation. The masses have drawn a picture of them: "Running to the countryside every day, using their brains less, just shouting 'leap forward,' with few methods, just jumping a little, and saying it's amazing." For example, in an agricultural cooperative in Jianyang County, when it was inspected a month ago, the wheat seedlings were in very good condition, but this time it was the worst, because too little fertilizer was applied. The resident cadres believed that the amount of fertilizer applied exceeded that of previous years. Judging from the seedlings, a yield of 500 jin per mu was not a problem, which was already a "leap forward" compared to the yield of 300 jin per mu last year. Therefore, they piled up a large amount of fertilizer and were unwilling to apply it to the wheat fields, planning to use it for the next season's major spring crops. After inspection, the potential for fertilizer here is still great. The enthusiasm of the masses for accumulating fertilizer is very high. Applying more fertilizer to the minor spring crops and organizing the masses to quickly accumulate another batch of fertilizer to supplement it. In this way, the yield of each mu of wheat will not be only 500 jin, but 600 jin or more. When inspecting in Renshou County, after a district sowed rice seeds, it encountered a cold wave. The district and township cadres immediately led the masses to desperately draw water into the rice fields. This kind of energy is commendable, but the method was ill-considered, and almost ruined all the rice seeds. Originally, they had sown ordinary rice seeds in previous years, and closing the water during a cold wave could prevent the cold because the water temperature was higher than the air temperature. This year, the seeds sown were sprouted seeds, and the germinated seeds could not breathe when the water was closed, and they would be suffocated.

The head of the prefectural committee said that the "small leap forward" leadership method is essentially a manifestation of conservative thinking under the situation of the Great Leap Forward. The head of the prefectural committee said that since spring plowing and production have been fully launched and the tasks are very urgent, it is necessary to quickly change this leadership method that cannot adapt to the situation of the Great Leap Forward. The prefectural committee has also put forward several specific measures, requiring all localities to implement them.

### 生产大跃进  领导小跃进  内江专区有些干部思想保守

    生产大跃进  领导小跃进
    内江专区有些干部思想保守
    新华社17日专电　中共四川省内江地委负责人最近率领各县县委书记检查春耕生产归来时，对新华社记者说，许多干部领导方法赶不上新形势的问题，应该引起很大注意。
    这位负责人说，他在这次历时半月的检查中，看到整风运动以后，各级干部思想作风和领导方法确有很大改变，全区春播比去年提前一个月完成。许多地区是进度快，质量高。但是，仍有相当一部分干部领导方法改变还很不彻底。他们在大跃进的形势下，采用了一种“小跃进”的领导方法。从表面上看来，他们也像是在跃进；生产成绩比往年大，领导方法比往年好。但他们的“跃进”多半为形势所迫，许多陈旧的观念并未打破，因而跃进的步伐总是跟不上形势的发展。群众给他们画的像是：“天天乡下跑、脑筋动得少，光是喊跃进，办法没几条，刚刚跳一下，就说不得了”。如简阳县有一个农业社，在一个月以前检查时，小麦苗架很好，但这次检查，它成了最差的一个，原因是追肥施少了。驻社干部认为施肥超过往年很多，从苗架看亩产五百斤没问题，这比去年亩产三百斤已是一个“跃进”，因此他们堆放着大量肥料不肯往小麦地里施，准备下一季大春使用。经检查，这里肥料的潜力还大，群众积肥热情很高，多施些肥料到小春作物上，把群众组织起来会很快再积一批肥料补充上去。这样，每亩小麦的产量就不只五百斤，而是六百斤或者更多。在仁寿县检查时，有一个区撒下谷种后遇到寒潮侵袭，区乡干部立刻带领群众拼命往秧田里车水，这种干劲可贵，但作法却欠考虑，差一点把全部谷种烂掉。原来往年这里撒的是一般谷种，遇寒潮关水可借水温高于气温防寒。今年撒下去的是催了芽的种子，关满水后发芽的谷种就无法行呼吸作用，是会闷死的。
    地委负责人说，“小跃进”的领导方法，实质上是保守思想在大跃进形势下的一种表现。地委负责人说，由于春耕生产已经全面展开，任务十分紧迫，必须迅速改变这种不能适应大跃进形势的领导方法，地委并提出几项具体措施，要求各地贯彻执行。
