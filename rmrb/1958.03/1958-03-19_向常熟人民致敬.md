Under the azure sky, red flags, seemingly endless, fluttered in the spring breeze along both sides of the road. Surrounding the red flags were countless people, wielding iron rakes, raking the damp river mud into soil baskets, carrying them load after load to the side of the lush green wheat fields, building one drainage ditch after another. The scent of the moist soil permeated the fields.

Without asking, a glance at this scene convinced us that we had already entered Changshu County. For in Shanghai, Comrade Ke Qingshi had introduced us to the scene of the great leap forward in Changshu's production. Now, seeing it with our own eyes: it was indeed so. Continuing along the Su-Chang highway, we saw very few pedestrians on the road, and the farmers in the fields on both sides were working intensely. Even in Changshu city, we saw very few idle people.

At ten o'clock in the morning on March 1st, we arrived at the Changshu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The first person we met was Comrade Chen Jinmei, a person full of enthusiasm and radiating energy. He is the Secretary of the County Committee. The First Secretary of the County Committee, Comrade Qian Xingchu, had gone to Suzhou to attend a provincial committee meeting. Comrade Chen Jinmei told us that during the Second Domestic Revolutionary period, Changshu had established a worker-peasant democratic government. During the Anti-Japanese War, Communist Party member Ren Tieshi established the Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Force here, leading the people in resisting Japan. Old soldiers of the Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Force, Zhu A’bo, well-known in the Changshu area, is now Comrade Zhu Ying, the Deputy County Head of Changshu County. A moment later, Comrade Zhu Ying arrived. He was originally a worker in the weaving room of the Shanghai Wing On Textile Factory. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he came to Changshu and salvaged the guns discarded by the retreating Kuomintang from the river, fighting bandits and resisting the Japanese invaders. Comrade Chen Jinmei? He is the son of a poor peasant, transferred from the Suzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to work in Changshu less than four years ago.

The people of Changshu have a glorious revolutionary tradition.

An Unconventional Conference

Then Comrade Chen Jinmei talked about the high tide of production this winter and spring. This stems from the Jiangsu Provincial Party Congress. As early as last winter, in order to implement the spirit of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Congress, the Changshu County Committee convened a representative conference of activists in building a new socialist countryside. This was a four-level meeting, with representatives from the county, district, township, and cooperative. Changshu County has a total agricultural population of 950,000, with 515,000 full and semi-laborers, 45 townships, and 916 cooperatives. Each cooperative had one to three people attending the meeting. To facilitate mobilizing the masses, instead of holding a closed-door meeting, it was an unconventional conference: the daily proceedings of the meeting were reported to the farmers throughout the county through wired broadcasting. Implementing while meeting; mobilizing within the meeting, acting outside the meeting. When the masses heard their cooperative director speak at the conference and propose an increase in production plan, they immediately held meetings to discuss, support, and endorse their cooperative director's plan. The conference solved the problem of the leap forward: Can we leap forward? Dare we leap forward? How do we leap forward? During the conference, the County Committee organized three broadcast rallies to promote the three major upsurges in agricultural production, introducing typical figures, showing facts and examples to the people of the county, and achieving great results. This representative conference was a large conference encompassing small meetings, and meetings outside the conference, and it can actually be said to be a mobilization rally for a million farmers in the county.

On February 13th, the Second Session of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party of Changshu opened. Comrade Qian Xingchu, on behalf of the County Committee, put forward a solemn task to the people of the county: To ensure the realization of the "struggle goals of 100 jin of ginned cotton, 800 jin of grain, 1 billion dan of fertilizer, 1 billion jin of grain, 1 million pigs, 500,000 sheep and 20 million cubic meters of earthwork in 1958."

"Get Grain from the Land, Get Fertilizer from the Rivers and Ponds"

After the rural economy changed from individual economy to collective economy, the socialist ideological consciousness greatly improved, cadres gained experience in leading collective production and agricultural cooperative management, and many advanced experiences and examples of leap forward emerged in agricultural production. However, the understanding of many people still lagged behind the objective situation, they could not see these new faces, and they were used to doing things according to routine. This is conservative thinking.

Take Bai Mao Township as an example. Because of the reduction in production in the autumn harvest last year, the mood for production was low in Bai Mao Township. They believed that production could only "progress gradually" and could not "leap forward." According to past conventions, they said that "winter is for warming yourself by the fire and eating," and that "eating too fast will choke you, walking too fast will make you fall." Although many people hoped for a great leap forward in production in 1958, they felt that "the heart is willing, but the strength is not enough." Even if they were "eager to try," they dared not jump boldly, and those who wanted to jump felt that they "couldn't find the door." Someone in Hexing Township even said: "The plan is on paper, the output is in the sky." The Provincial Party Congress and the County Activists' Representative Conference solved the "leap forward" problem. After a great debate, recalling the winter of 1955 and the spring of 1956, under the encouragement of the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Program, a production upsurge of "Kunshan in the south to the Yangtze River in the north, a large group during the day, red all over the sky at night" was launched, and a bumper harvest was obtained. Township, cooperative cadres, and the masses realized that "if you put in the effort, you can leap forward."

Once the socialist consciousness of the masses is raised and revolutionary vigor is boosted, it is like a burst atomic nucleus, the power of which cannot be estimated, and the leadership often lags far behind the broad masses. The original planned yield per mu in Bai Mao Township was 780 jin, which was later revised to 820 jin, and then revised again to 900 jin, an increase of 80% over the yield per mu in 1957. Water conservancy construction increased from 300,000 cubic meters to 900,000 cubic meters. The entire township has to drain the river to accumulate fertilizer, planning to dredge 462 rivers and ponds, with a total length of 204 li. The Bai Mao Pond alone is more than ten li long. With full of vigor and confidence, the masses put forward a heroic slogan: "Get grain from the land, get fertilizer from the rivers and ponds."

Grasping "draining the river to accumulate fertilizer" is a very good way to solve the fertilizer source problem. Take Bai Mao Township as an example. They originally relied on dredging mud for fertilizer, and the township had 700 boats dredging mud. It would take until the Mango Planting season to solve the base fertilizer for the ripening crop, and if they were late, they would definitely cause "white fingers planting seedlings." But the problem of "draining the river to accumulate fertilizer" was completely solved, and it had "three benefits," "four savings," and "seven advantages." The three benefits are: beneficial for accumulating fertilizer, beneficial for irrigation, and beneficial for transportation. The "four savings" are: saving water lifting, saving labor, saving costs, and saving time. The "seven advantages" are: raising the fields, building good dams, repairing river beaches to eliminate snails, eliminating wild fish, benefiting fish farming, eating fish and shellfish, and increasing production. Changshu adopted the method of "tackling large rivers, connecting small creeks, and digging ponds along the way," and put forward the battle slogan: "Don't be afraid of large and deep rivers, turn every river bottom over."

The entire county will excavate 18,000 large and small rivers. In other aspects, the County Committee originally proposed accumulating 500 million dan of fertilizer and building 5 million cubic meters of water conservancy, but after repeated revisions, the fifth revision was 1 billion dan of fertilizer and 20 million cubic meters of water conservancy. Now the County Committee is considering revising the plan again.

"For 900 Jin, We Are Not Afraid of Three Inches of Ice"

In the afternoon, we went to Nanfeng Township with Comrade Chen Jinmei. This is an advanced township, more than 20 kilometers away from Changshu County. Their target for yield per mu is 1,050 jin, which broke through the target of the County Committee.

Walking into Nanfeng Township, the farmers in the fields were working more intensely than in other townships, and our hearts were also beating rapidly. Although we were eager to visit the heroic figures of the thousand-jin township, we couldn't help but go to the fields and carry two loads of mud before reluctantly leaving the fields and walking into the farmers' homes, where we met Comrade Zhu Wenbin, Secretary of the Nanfeng Township Party Committee, and Comrade Wang Wangen, Director of Renhe Cooperative.

Comrade Zhu Wenbin told us about the recent brilliant achievements of Nanfeng Township: The original plan was for a yield of 1,050 jin per mu, 1.9 million cubic meters of water conservancy, 32 million dan of fertilizer accumulation, 670,000 trees for afforestation, and 7,116 pigs raised. Now it has completed more than 1.373 million cubic meters of water conservancy, more than 26 million dan of fertilizer accumulation, and more than 400,000 trees for afforestation. The amount of fertilizer accumulated alone is equal to the total amount of fertilizer accumulated in the ten years before liberation.

Under the call of the County Committee, they held meetings in the middle of the night and started work at dawn. From the township to the cooperative to the team, they grasped the plan tightly and would not let go. County and township cadres went to the cooperatives with their bedding, saying: We will not return until the plan is realized. The masses said: As long as I have a breath, the plan must be realized. No dividends will be distributed until the plan is completed. Forty-three teams in the township fought for seven days and seven nights to grab the red flag. More than 100 gasoline lamps were lit at night, forming a continuous area, visible across the river, which people called "Shanghai North Xinjing."

On the night of January 14th, snowflakes floated in the sky, and the whistling north wind blowing from the river further amplified the momentum of the continuous rain and snow. The weather was freezing, minus ten degrees, and severe cold swept across Changshu. The people in the city had long been sound asleep. But more than 3,500 heroes from Nanfeng Township were mobilized, including 226 women. The oldest woman was Mao Xiuying from Shengjian Cooperative. She was already in her sixties, and she was still carrying mud with everyone else in the wind and snow, and she carried it easily and happily. People became younger in collective labor. Ma Shunyuan had a toothache, but he didn't come down. When the pain became unbearable, he held a piece of ice in his mouth as a sedative to relieve the pain. When the ice melted, he held another piece. Although the gasoline lamps illuminated the snowy night, it was still night after all! Moreover, the soil on the ground was wet, and some people accidentally fell. Yang Liubao, a member of Shengjian Cooperative, lost a tooth, but he kept his mouth shut, trying not to let anyone know, so that he could continue working. Blood flowed from his mouth, and he was immediately discovered. When asked to go back to rest, he refused. Everyone persuaded him, and he had no choice but to agree, but he still wanted to carry three more loads before he would go down.

Not only adults were mobilized, but even children participated in the great labor ranks. There was a children's team in Nanfeng Township, consisting of ten children, the youngest being less than ten years old, and the oldest only fourteen. They made small carrying poles and carried river mud. Do you think they are small and not strong enough? They will tell you: Ants can build mountains by moving mud, let alone children. Within five days, the children's team carried four mu of fertile mud, and this four mu of land was named the Children's Field.

Healthy people all went to the fields, and the disabled were not content to stay at home and wanted to participate in labor. There was a blind man in Nanfeng Township who also joined the great labor force. People asked him: How can a blind man work well? He asked in return: Why can't a blind man work well? Others dug soil and put it on a shovel, and he could throw it in the designated direction.

Do you say it's freezing cold? The people of Nanfeng Township said: Hard ground is not as hard as an iron rake, and an iron rake is not as hard as people's hearts. No matter how cold it is, no matter how strong the wind and snow are, the heroes of Nanfeng Township will work. If the neck is cold and there is no scarf, wrap it with pants; if the hands are cold and there are no gloves, put on socks; anyway, nothing can stop the heroes of Nanfeng.

Not only is Nanfeng like this, Comrade Chen Jinmei told us that those townships like Bai Mao and Qiaotang are also the same as Nanfeng. In the heavy wind and snow, they were also mobilized and fought with the more than three-inch-thick solid ice. The first axe hit down, and with a bang, it bounced back, shaking the hand painfully. The second axe hit down, and only a white mark was made. The third axe hit down, and a small hole was chiseled open. They carried a piece of ice that was eight feet long, six feet wide, and more than three inches thick to the road, and wrote on it: "For 900 jin, we are not afraid of three inches of ice." More than 20 young cooperative members wrote on a large ice block weighing 800 jin: "Not afraid of cold weather and freezing, freeze to the bottom; are you a hero, or am I a hero?"

Qiaotang Township put forward the loud slogans of "three not afraid," "four wants," and "five non-stop": "Three not afraid": For 900 jin, one is not afraid of a poor family; two is not afraid of cold weather and freezing; three is not afraid of difficulties. "Four wants": For 900 jin, if you want money, there is money; if you want labor, there is labor; whatever you want to do, you can do; whenever you want to do it, you can do it. "Five non-stop": For 900 jin, small rain and snow will not stop; strong winds will not stop; freezing will not stop; not working ten hours a day will not stop; not completing agricultural work in a day will not stop.

    向常熟人民致敬
    周扬　周而复
    在蓝湛湛的天空下，公路两旁插着一眼望不尽的红旗，迎着春风飘扬。红旗四周是数不清的人群，挥动着铁耙，把潮湿的河泥耙进土筐，一担一担挑到绿茵茵的麦田旁边，修起一条接着一条的出水沟。那润湿的泥土的气息扬溢在四野。
    不用问，一看这情景，我们断定已经走入了常熟县境。因为在上海的时候，柯庆施同志就向我们介绍了常熟生产大跃进的情景。现在亲眼看到：果然如此。顺着苏常公路走下去，路上很少看到行人，两旁田里的农民都在紧张地劳动。甚至到了常熟城里，也很少看到闲散的人。
    3月1日上午十点，我们到了中共常熟县委员会，首先见到的是陈锦美同志，一个充满了热情和浑身都闪耀着干劲的人。他是县委书记。县委第一书记惰性初同志到苏州去出席省委的会议去了。陈锦美同志告诉我们常熟在第二次国内革命时期曾经成立过工农民主政权，抗日战争时期，共产党员任铁石在这儿成立江南抗日游击队，领导人民抗战。江抗队的老战士、常熟一带无人不知的朱阿伯，就是现在常熟县副县长朱英同志。一会儿，朱英同志来了。他原来是上海永安纱厂布机间的工人，抗日战争爆发，他到了常熟，从河浜里捞起国民党退走时扔下的枪支，打击土匪，抵抗日寇。陈锦美同志呢？他是继水贫农的儿子，从中共苏州地委调到常熟来工作还不到四年。
    常熟人民有光辉的革命传统。
    别开生面的大会
    接着陈锦美同志谈到这次冬春生产的高潮。这得从中共江苏省党代表会议说起。早在去年冬天，常熟县委为了贯彻江苏省党代会的精神，召开了建设社会主义新农村积极分子代表大会。这是四级会议，县、区、乡、社都有人参加。常熟全县农业人口有九十五万，全半劳动力五十一万五千人，四十五个乡，九百一十六个社，每社有一人到三人出席了这个会。为了便于发动群众，不是关门开会，而是一个别开生面的大会：通过有线广播，把每天会议情况向全县农民报告。边开会，边贯彻；会内动员，会外行动。群众听到自己的社长在大会上发言，提出增产计划，他们马上就开会讨论，拥护和支持自己社长的计划。会上解决跃进问题：能不能跃进？敢不敢跃进？怎么样跃进？在会议期间，县委又组织了三次促进农业生产三大高潮的广播大会，介绍典型人物，给全县人民看事实、摆样子，收到极大的效果。这个代表大会是大会套小会，会外又有会，实际上可以说是一个全县百万农民的誓师大会。
    2月13日，中共常熟第一届代表大会第二次会议开幕了，惰性初同志代表县委向全县人民提出了庄严的任务：保证在1958年实现“百斤皮棉，八百斤粮，十亿担肥料，十亿斤粮，百万头生猪，五十万头羊和二千万土方的奋斗目标。”
    “向土地要粮食向河塘要肥料”
    农村从个体经济改变为集体经济以后，社会主义的思想觉悟大大提高，干部在领导集体生产和农业社经营管理上摸索到经验，农业生产上出现了许多先进经验和跃进的榜样。但是还有不少人的认识落后于客观的形势，看不到这些新面貌，习惯于按常规办事。这就是保守思想。
    就拿白茆乡来说吧。白茆乡由于去年秋收减产定论，生产情绪低落，认为生产只能“渐进”，不能“跃进”，按照过去的成规，说什么“冬天是烘火吃饭天”，并且“吃饭快了要噎，走路快了要跌”。虽然也有许多人希望1958年生产大跃进，可是觉得“心有余，而力不足”。纵然“跃跃欲试”，也不敢大胆跳，想跳的也感到“不得其门”。甚至合兴乡有人说：“计划在纸上，产量在天上”。省党代会和县积极分子代表大会解决了“跃进”的问题，再经过大辩论，回想起1955年冬和1956年春，在农业纲要四十条的鼓舞下，掀起了“南至昆山，北到长江，白天一大群，夜里满天红”的生产高潮，获得了丰收，乡、社干部和群众认识到：“拿出干劲，就能跃进”。
    一旦群众社会主义觉悟提高，鼓足革命干劲，就像是一粒爆破了的原子核，那威力叫人们无法估计，领导就往往远落在广大群众后面。白茆乡原订亩产量七百八十斤，后来修改到八百二十斤，旋即又改订到九百斤，比1957年亩产量提高到80％。兴修水利从三十万方提高到九十万方。全乡要干河积肥，规划车干河塘四百六十二条，全长二百零四里，单是白茆塘就有十里多长。群众干劲十足，信心百倍，提出英雄口号：“向土地要粮食，向河塘要肥料。”
    解决肥源问题紧紧抓住“干河积肥”是一个很好的办法。拿白茆乡来说，他们原来积肥靠罱泥，全乡有七百条船罱泥，要到芒种才能解决大熟基肥，赶不上时间，就一定要造成“白指头莳秧”。但“干河积肥”问题便完全解决，并且有“三利”“四省”和“七好处”。三利是：利积肥，利灌溉，利交通。“四省”是：省车水，省人工，省成本，省时间。“七好处”是：垫高田地，筑好坝闸，修好河滩灭掉钉螺，消灭野鱼，有利养鱼，吃到鱼蚌和增加产量。常熟采取“揪大河，带小浜，顺便挖潭塘”的办法，提出战斗口号：“不怕河大水又深，条条河底都翻身。”
    全县要开挖大小河道一万八千条。其他方面，原来县委提出积肥五亿担，兴修水利五百万土方，经过一次又一次修订，第五次修订积肥十亿担，水利二千万土方，现在县委又在考虑修订计划了。
    “为了九百斤，那怕三寸冰”
    下午，我们和陈锦美同志一同到了南丰乡。这是先进乡，离常熟县城有二十多公里。他们那儿的亩产量的指标是一千零五十斤，又突破了县委的指标。
    走到南丰乡，田里农民比别的乡劳动得更紧张，我们的心也跟着急遽地跳动。我们虽然急于要访问千斤乡的英雄人物，但也忍不住走到田里，挑了两担泥，才恋恋不舍地离开田里，走进农民的家里，在那儿，我们见到中共南丰乡党委书记朱文彬同志和仁和社社长王万根同志。
    朱文彬同志告诉我们最近南丰乡的辉煌的战果：原定规划是亩产量一千零五十斤，水利一百九十万方，积肥三千二百万担，绿化六十七万株，养猪七千一百十六头。现在已完成水利一百三十七万三千多方，积肥二千六百多万担，绿化四十多万株。单是完成的积肥一项数字，就等于解放前十年积肥的总和。
    在县委的号召下，他们半夜开会，拂晓上工。从乡到社到队，抓住规划死不放。县乡干部背着铺盖下社，说：不实现规划不回来。群众说：只要我有一口气，规划一定要实现。不完成规划绝对不分红。全乡有四十三个队为了抢红旗连战七天七夜，晚上汽油灯一百多盏，连成一片，隔江相望，人称“上海北新径”。
    1月14日深夜，天空飘起雪花，从江边吹来的呼呼的北风，更助长了连绵雨雪的声势，天寒地冻，零下十度，严寒席卷了常熟。城里人们早已酣睡了。但南丰乡的三千五百多名英雄们出动了，其中有二百二十六名是妇女，年纪最大的妇女要数生建社的毛秀英，她已经六十多岁了，也照样在风雪中和大家一道挑泥，而且挑得轻松愉快，人在集体劳动中都变得年青了。马顺远牙痛，也不下来，痛的实在忍不住了，就含一块冰在嘴里，当做镇静剂止痛，冰化了，再含一块。汽油灯虽然照亮了风雪之夜，但终究是夜晚啊！何况地上的泥土又潮湿哩，有些人不小心就摔跤了。生建社社员杨六保就跌落了牙齿，可是他紧紧闭着嘴，想不让任何人知道，好坚持劳动下去。血从他嘴里流出来了，马上被人发觉，要他回去休息，他不肯。大家劝他，他没有办法，只好答应，不过还要再挑三担才肯下去。
    不但大人出动，连小孩子也参加了伟大的劳动行列。南丰乡有个儿童队，十个孩子组成，小的不到十岁，最大的也只十四岁，他们做了小扁担，挑河泥。你嫌他们人小力气不大吗？他们会对你说：蚂蚁搬泥都可以堆成山，更别说儿童了。五天之内，儿童队挑了四亩肥泥，这四亩地命名儿童田。
    健康的人都下地了，残废的也不安心呆在家里，要参加劳动。南丰乡有个瞎子，也走进劳动大军。人们问他：瞎子怎么好劳动？他反问：瞎子为什么不好劳动？别人挖土放在铁铲上，他可以按照指定的方向甩出去。
    你说天寒地冻吗？南丰乡的人说：地硬没有铁耙硬，铁耙没有人心硬，那怕你天寒地冻，那怕你大风大雪，南丰乡的英雄也要劳动。脖子冷，没有围巾，用裤子围上；手冷，没有手套，用袜子套上；反正什么也难不倒南丰的英雄。
    岂止南丰是这样，陈锦美同志告诉我们白茆和桥塘那些乡也都是和南丰一样。在大风雪中，他们也出动了，和三寸多厚的坚冰搏斗。第一斧头劈下去，崩的一声给弹回来了，把手震动得很痛。第二斧劈下去，才打出一道白痕，第三斧头下去，凿开了一个小小的洞口。他们把一块八尺长、六尺阔的三寸多厚的冰块扛到大路上，上面写道：“为了九百斤，那怕三寸冰。”还有二十多个青年社员在一块八百斤的大冰块上写道：“不怕天寒地冻，冰冻冰，冻到底；你英雄，还是我英雄？”
    桥塘乡提出“三不怕”“四要”和“五不停”的响亮号召：“三不怕”：为了九百斤，一不怕家底穷；二不怕天寒地冻；三不怕困难重重。“四要”：为了九百斤，要钱有钱；要劳力有劳力；要干啥就干啥；要啥辰光干就啥辰光干。“五不停”：为了九百斤，小雨小雪不停；刮大风不停；结冰不停；一天不干十小时不停；一天农活不完成不停。　（未完）
