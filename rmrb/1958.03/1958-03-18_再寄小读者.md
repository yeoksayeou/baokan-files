    More Letters to Young Readers
    Bing Xin

    Communication One
    To the seemingly familiar children:

    First, I thank the editor of the People's Daily supplement for their letter, and then I thank the Chinese Writers Association's call "Writers! Leap Forward! Great Leap Forward!" which has once again propelled my heart back into my bosom!

    For over twenty years, I have ceased communication with you, and I truly don't know how much shame and trouble this has brought me. I have many things to say, many events to recount, but I don't know where to begin, because those words, those events, although very interesting and moving, are also very fragmented and piecemeal. I cannot write a great article, and even if I did, it might not be a good one. Therefore, over the years, I have heartlessly allowed those feelings that flashed across my heart and before my eyes to slip out of my memory and fade into a hazy mist.

    In this extraordinary spring, I once again think of you with extreme sincerity and fervor. I seem to see your dark, shining eyes and your flushed, slightly shy faces, red from laughter. You love to hear fun and interesting stories, no matter how fragmented or piecemeal they may be. You are, in fact, the very object of my writing, and this is exceptionally clear! Very well, I will now pick up this pen again and write to you. No matter where I go, I will take my love for you with me! I will write constantly and write well, and I will pour out to you everything I see, hear, and think, as long as I feel it will interest you and benefit you. Wait patiently, my little friends!

    Since deciding to write to you again, I have been unable to sleep soundly for several nights. I woke up at four o'clock this morning, and when I opened my eyes, the window was full of bright moonlight! I suddenly remembered the latter half of a poem written by I don't know which ancient poet, it goes: "The west wind sweeps the ground, the sky is about to dawn, the half-drawn curtain shows the returning dream, news of ten years floods the mind." That is to say: as the sky is about to dawn, a west wind is blowing across the ground, and waking from a dream, one sees pale moonlight shining on half of the window curtain. Here, the word 'news' can be interpreted as "events," meaning that the events of ten years ago are suddenly recalled!

    My little friends, from the time I first started writing to you, it has been more than ten years, it has been over thirty years. In these thirty years, our beloved motherland has undergone such great changes! These changes are earth-shattering, transforming from hell to heaven, and step by step becoming even more bright and splendid. We are all happy! I am fortunate to have caught up with this era, and the happiest of all are you, how many wonderful days are waiting for you to live, and how many great undertakings are waiting for you to do!

    My state of mind on my pillow is very different from that of this poet! Although there is also a window full of bright moonlight, the wind blowing outside the window is a gentle east wind, and soon the morning sun will rise. On the more than nine million square kilometers of our motherland, six hundred million people will be filled with joy and confidence, beginning peaceful labor. Little friends, perhaps you feel that this is everyday life, but thirty years ago, this kind of everyday life was unimaginable to me!

    My nose feels a little sore, and my eyes feel a little acidic, but I am definitely not sad. You will all understand my excited mood at this moment in the future—this communication will end here, let me repeat the last sentence of the first letter to young readers: "My heart is indescribable, I feel very honored!"

                Your friend, Bing Xin

    再寄小读者
    冰心
    通讯一
    似曾相识的小朋友们：
    先感谢人民日报副刊编辑的一封书，再感谢中国作协“作家们！跃进！大跃进！”的号召，把我的心又推进到我的心窝里来了！
    二十几年来，中断了和你们的通讯，真不知给我自己带来了多少的惭愧和烦恼。我有许多话，许多事情，不知从何说起，因为那些话，那些事情，虽然很有趣，很动人，但却也很零碎，很片断，写不出一篇大文章，就是写了，也不一定就是一篇好文章；因此这些年来，从我心上眼前掠过的那些感受，我也就忍心地让它滑出我的记忆之外，淡化入模糊的烟雾之中。
    在这不平常的春天里，我又极其真切，极其炽热地想起你们来了，我似乎看见了你们漆黑发光的大眼睛，笑哮了的通红而略带腼腆的小脸。你们是爱听好玩有趣的事情的，不管它多么零碎，多么片断。你们本来就是我写作的对象，这一点是异常地明确的！好吧，我如今再拿起这支笔来，给你们写通讯，不论我走到哪里，我要把热爱你们的心，带到哪里！我要不断地写，好好地写，把我所看到听到想到的事情，只要我觉得你们会感到兴趣，会对你们有益的，我都要尽量地对你们倾吐。安心地等待着吧，我的小朋友！
    自从决心再给你们写通讯，我好几夜不能安眠。今早四点钟就醒了，睁开眼来是满窗的明月！我忽然想起不知是那位古诗人写的一首词的下半阕，是：“卷地西风天欲曙，半帘残月梦初回，十年消息上心来。”就是说：在天快亮的时候，窗外刮着卷地的西风，从梦中醒来看见了淡白的月光照着半段窗帘；这里‘消息’两个字，可以当作“事情”讲，就是说，把十年前的往事，一下子都回忆起来了！
    小朋友，从我第一次开始给你们写通讯算起，不止十年，乃是三十多年了，这三十多年之中，我们亲爱的祖国，经过了多大的变迁！这变迁是翻天复地的，从地狱翻上了天堂，而且一步一步地更要光明灿烂。我们都是幸福的！我总算赶上了这个时代，而最幸福的还是你们，有多少美好的日子等着你们来过，更有多少伟大的事业等着你们去做呵！
    我在枕上的心境，和这位诗人是迥不相同的！虽然也有满窗的明月，而窗外吹拂的却是和煦的东风，一会儿朝阳就要升起，祖国方圆九百多万平方公里的土地上，将要有六亿人民满怀愉快和信心，开始着和平的劳动。小朋友们也许觉得这是日常生活，但是在三十年前，这种的日常生活，是我所不能想像的！
    我鼻子里有点发辣，眼睛里有点发酸，但我决不是难过，你们将来一定会懂得我这时这种兴奋的心情的——这篇通讯就到此为止吧，让我再重复初寄小读者通讯一的末一句话：“我心中莫可名状，我觉得非常的荣幸！”
                你的朋友　冰心
                      1958、3、11、北京
