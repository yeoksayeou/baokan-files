    Thoughts on the Pingju Opera "Sanliwan"
    Zhang Geng
    I recently saw the China Pingju Theatre's performance of "Sanliwan" and was very satisfied. It's been a while since I've seen such a good modern play performed on the Pingju stage.
    I have read the novel "Sanliwan." Even so, the stage version of "Sanliwan" felt particularly fresh to me. As the scenes unfolded, both the characters' images and the plot's development were captivating. It wasn't like some plays where you know the ending as soon as you see the beginning, and you can guess all the characters' future words and actions as soon as they appear on stage.
    My words might seem to suggest that this Pingju version of "Sanliwan" simply avoids being formulaic and conceptual, with no particular brilliance. But I think that escaping formulaic and conceptual approaches is not a simple matter; it is a great success in itself. First of all, the original author provided a very good foundation. Secondly, the playwrights summarized and adapted this story, which involves many characters and events, into a script. This was not easy. Adapting it into a script while preserving the original style, without reducing the rich and vivid atmosphere of life in the original work to a dry story, was even more difficult. This is the most common problem when adapting novels into plays. Furthermore, the efforts of the director and actors are clearly visible. Many characters in the play leave a relatively distinct and prominent impression. The prominence of the backward characters is not so rare, but several positive characters, such as Lingzhi, Yumei, Yusheng, and Zhang Yongqing, all have distinct personalities, which is commendable. In particular, several characters who are criticized, such as Fan Denggao and Ma Duoshou, are criticized appropriately, which is not easy to achieve on stage. On stage, it is relatively easy to praise or negate people, but it is much more difficult to criticize people without completely negating them. As for someone like Fan Denggao, to consistently criticize his mistakes on stage while still allowing the audience to feel that he is fundamentally a positive character is not an easy task.
    But for the China Pingju Theatre, this success is not accidental. Their efforts in learning and their continuous practice in art over the past few years have prepared the conditions. All of this can be seen and felt in this play.
    For example, the success in portraying new characters clearly demonstrates the actors' rapid improvement in politics and ideology over the past few years. I dare say that characters like Fan Denggao and Lingzhi could not have been portrayed on the Pingju stage in the early days of liberation. The problems these characters encountered, the way they solved them, their pain and joy, were incomprehensible at the time. We can recall that at that time, a trend of imitating cadres and new characters solely from their external appearance and actions appeared on stage. Why did this imitation occur? The actors could not understand the characters' joys, sorrows, and angers, and could not guess these emotions at all. They had to start with their external appearance and could only stop at external imitation. Today, the situation above has passed, and new characters and new emotions have appeared on the stage. For example, Fan Denggao's long solo performance with dialogue and singing, recalling the past suffering and thus repenting of his current behavior, cannot be accomplished solely with external techniques or singing experience. It requires understanding this emotion, accepting this emotion, and creating it from one's own inner feeling. This is evident in the scenes of Lingzhi and Yusheng's love, and in Yumei's feelings for Youyi. It is these characters and their emotions that leave a fresh impression on us on stage, making us feel that a new socialist opera is sprouting and growing.
    It is not enough to talk only about ideological progress. Actors have also learned new methods in shaping characters; they have learned the importance of understanding the characters' emotions from the inside out, learned methods of analyzing the characters' thoughts and personalities, and learned to pay attention to life and consciously observe and experience life. This method makes actors care about the surrounding life, care about events in life, and care about people and their ideological changes. The new method of artistic creation links their professional needs with their concern for politics. Only with this new attitude towards life and art can new characters be shaped on stage.
    On the other hand, it can also be seen that a serious study of tradition is one of the reasons for their success.
    The Pingju Theatre once pursued a kind of realism from the spoken drama stage in some plays. For example, in the scene of Du Shiniang throwing herself into the river, a large boat was set up on the stage, which made the originally very lively performance "lethargic." This was because some new comrades who participated in opera work at that time were not familiar with the expressive techniques of opera. This time, the play has a different appearance. The director and actors dare to boldly use traditional techniques when expressing brand-new themes and characters, thus achieving considerable success. For example, the performance of the Ma Duoshou family is relatively exaggerated. These actors boldly absorbed the performance methods of the role's profession, making the outline of each character very distinct and prominent, such as the unprovable Comrade Zhang Yulan, the muddle-headed Comrade Song Changwen, and the often-reasonable Comrade Zhao Lirong, all of whom are very successful. But these few characters, who are all dressed as clowns, have no similarity, each with its own characteristics. The director also boldly and successfully used percussion instruments in this aspect to create a strong comedic atmosphere. For example, Lingzhi's "fortune telling" scene was originally a subtle psychological activity in the original novel, and in the script, it is only, and can only be, a psychological description and emotional expression. But the director appropriately made it action-oriented and dance-oriented, adding percussion instruments, which gave this scene a fresh and lively appearance. On the whole, the distinctness of the characters is the biggest feature of this play. On the one hand, this is inseparable from the original author's style, but it is also a direct result of the director and actors daring to use the bright and exaggerated techniques of opera performance.
    This powerfully concludes a dispute in fact. The dispute is: can traditional performance techniques of opera, especially performance techniques, especially performance programs based on professions, be used to express modern life? The practice of this play tells us: yes! As long as it is used appropriately, as long as it starts from the plot and from the characters, it will be successful. Not only that, but it also proves that hard-copying the methods of spoken drama often loses the vivid impression, loses the effect, and makes people feel awkward.
    This is a good play, a successful play, that is not a problem. But in order to make new creations on the stage even better, some suggestions for improvement can also be made. Many traditional repertoires on our opera stage are so refined and complete in art, not because they were so good from the beginning; they were gradually refined through the continuous processing of countless years and countless actors. In order to create new modern art that can be compared with classical art, we should do more processing on new repertoires.
    In order to help with processing, I put forward some opinions for reference.
    In terms of the script, I feel that the first act is written relatively chaotically. In spoken drama writing, the first act is often not easy to write well, because it is necessary to introduce the plot and characters, and there must be a play, which makes the clues complicated, and the audience cannot see it clearly. The first act of Pingju's "Sanliwan" also has this problem. Too many things and characters are introduced, and the audience's impression is not deep. Our opera method is relatively simple, using self-reporting to directly narrate it. This method is very easy for the audience to accept and is a very popular method; its disadvantage is only that it is not dramatic enough. If it is used uncritically in plays of modern life, it will feel unharmonious. But if we express this method of self-reporting in a more dramatic form, we can achieve the effect of being both clear and having a play. In fact, the advantage of so-called self-reporting, on the one hand, to sum up, is nothing more than introducing the most necessary characters and plots first, without rushing to stuff all the main characters and plots to the audience all at once; instead, let the audience gradually get to know the people they should know and understand the things they should understand in suitable occasions in the future. In this way, the development of the story is very natural, and the audience does not feel tired. Similarly, in "Qin Xianglian" performed by the China Pingju Theatre, the opening scene is Xianglian checking into a shop, which is actually narrating the story, but the dramatic contradiction has already begun to be expressed. As for the other protagonist, Chen Shimei, he is brought out by the gatekeeper in the middle of the palace intrusion. In this way, before the person appears on stage, the audience already knows him, and there is no need to work hard to introduce him at all. This concise and clear method should be said to be the essence of the opera heritage, very mass-oriented, and therefore very popular.
    Can the scene of Fan Denggao's transformation also be improved further? The current problem is that the entire story is narrated in flashbacks, there is more narration and less action on the stage, and the emotions at the beginning are not connected to the previous scene, which seems a bit loose. How to improve it, I can't think of a good way yet, just put it forward for research.
    In terms of performance, directing, and music, I think the entire singing of "Sanliwan" this time sounds very smooth and completely has the taste of Pingju opera. It can be seen that after several years of research and study, the music workers have overcome the shortcomings of not understanding and not being familiar with it and have become experts. But if you ask for further improvement, you will feel that there is a biggest shortcoming, the lack of good singing. This is a relatively big shortcoming in Pingju opera's habits. Pingju opera must have good singing to make the audience watch it again and again without getting bored. Several repertoires of the Pingju Theatre such as "Qin Xianglian," "Little Son-in-law," and "Liu Qiao'er" all have well-known famous singing segments, such as "Intrusion into the Palace," "Bird into the Forest," and "Picking Mulberry Leaves," but this time, there is no such singing. Originally, Lingzhi's "fortune telling" should be sung well, but the actor's singing art did not give people a deep infection here. This is a major loss. If the singing here is good, it will add a lot of glory. Young actors should put more effort into this aspect. Without this effort, the actor's art will be missing one aspect.
    Directors and music designers should also bear a certain responsibility to help "create tunes." In the past, this was entirely a personal matter for the actors. Now that there is a unified design in art, they must inevitably put some effort into this aspect. This time, the singing seems a bit unbalanced. For example, Comrade Zhang Defu, who played Fan Denggao, sang several segments very well. A segment of singing in the scene of arguing with his daughter can indeed express his feelings and even won the applause of the audience, which is also a achievement in developing Pingju opera's male role singing. But looking at the entire play, it seems unbalanced; the planning in music is not enough. The most wonderful singing should not be arranged here, or although the singing here should also be very good, there should be more attractive good singing in the several climax places of the play, such as Lingzhi's "fortune telling," to hold it down. (In another climax, the scene of Fan Denggao's transformation, there is a very sufficient performance of singing, and the actors also sing well. The reason why this cannot give people a deeper infection is probably related to the flashback method of the script.) I hope that if there are any revisions in the future, this aspect can be remedied.
    Many of the villainous roles this time were played very well, but the singing aspect is also relatively weak, and I hope that these actors will make more efforts in this aspect.
    In addition, I think the personality of the positive characters can be more prominent, or simply say that the comedy of these characters can be strengthened, and it can be performed slightly more exaggeratedly, and the color will be richer. For example, Lingzhi's mumbling personality (Comrade Zhao Shuli's words) is expressed more emphatically, for example, making a strong contrast between Lingzhi's intellectual flavor and Yumei's cheerful personality will definitely make the play more beautiful. This time, Comrade Wan Jing, who played Yumei, performed very well and sang with great flavor. Comrade Wan Jing is a new opera actor who changed careers to perform Pingju opera, and the results in the past few years have been quite outstanding. But from the director's point of view, the best person to play Yumei is a strong and tall actor, which is convenient for contrasting with Lingzhi's delicate intellectual appearance and can produce more comedy effects in the play of the four young people.
    Ma Youyi is a promising young actor, but he lacks experience in performance and appears weaker, which makes the color of this part of the play not as vivid as it should be. Can the director help him break through some difficulties and enable him to have more infectious performances in key scenes, such as running away from home?
    In terms of opera stage design, the Pingju Theatre has made great creations and achieved many results in the past few years. This time, it is still designed from the aspect of simplicity, with a simple style. For example, the scene of Ma Duoshou's house is very fresh in artistic style and can be closely combined with the requirements of the performance, which is very good. The shortcoming of the stage art design of this play lies in the lack of unified style. We will not talk about the realistic style of the first scene's exterior scene. This problem has not been solved on many opera stages, and we cannot make too high demands on the designers of "Sanliwan" alone. Just put it forward as a problem for the stage art community to discuss, hoping to get some solutions. In addition, the half-door in the scene of Fan Denggao's transformation is really a redundant and very unsightly thing. If it is said more seriously, it is somewhat hindering the actor's performance and destroying the audience's imagination. If we don't want this half-door and only use lighting to express it, will the audience not be able to distinguish the inside and outside of the house? Countless experiences have proven that it will not. I remember that the first act of "The White-Haired Girl" performed in Yan'an also had scenes inside and outside the door, and there was only a small piece of film as an interior scene. In the performance, it not only did not destroy the sense of reality but also used the virtual door to make many beautiful gestures. These experiences are still worth adopting.

    评剧“三里湾”观后感
    张庚
    最近看了中国评剧院演出的“三里湾”，很满意。好些时候没有看到过评戏舞台上演出这么好的现代戏了。
    小说的“三里湾”我是读过的，虽然这样，舞台上的“三里湾”对我还是特别新鲜，一场一场地演下去，无论在人物的形象上还是事件的发展上，都有引人入胜的感觉，不像有些戏那样，看了头就知道了尾，人物刚上场就猜出了他以后的全部言论行动。
    我这话仿佛只是说这回评戏的“三里湾”没有公式化概念化而已，并无特别奥妙之处。但我觉得摆脱了公式化概念化也并不是那样简单的事，它本身就是很大的成功。首先，原作者提供了很好的基础。其次，剧作者们把这一篇涉及到很多人物和事件的故事提纲挈领地翻成台本，这就不容易；翻成台本而保存了原作的风格，也没有把原作中丰富生动的生活气息弄得只剩下干巴巴的故事就更不容易。而小说改编成戏，这个毛病是最容易发生的。再则导演和演员们的努力也是显然可见的。戏中间的许多人物，给人的印象都比较鲜明突出，落后人物的突出还不算希奇，几个正面人物，如灵芝、玉梅、玉生、张永清等都具有鲜明的性格，这是难能可贵的；特别有几个被批判的人物，像范登高、马多寿等，批判的恰如其分，这在舞台上并不是一件那么好办的事。在舞台上，要表扬人或者否定人这比较便当，要批判人而又不全部否定他，就困难得多；至于像范登高这样的人，在舞台上一直批评他的错误，而仍旧要让观众感觉到他基本上是个正面人物，尤其不是一件轻松方便的工作。
    但在中国评剧院来说，这个成功也不是偶然得来的。这几年，他们在学习方面的努力，在艺术上不断的实践，是准备了条件的。这都从这次戏里可以看出来，感受到。
    比方在表现新人物的成功上，就可以鲜明地感觉到演员们这几年来在政治上、思想上有了飞快的提高。我敢说，像范登高这样的人物，灵芝这样的人物，在解放初期的评戏舞台上是演不出来的。这些人物所遭遇的问题，他们解决问题的方式，他们的痛苦和快乐，在当时是无法理解的。我们可以回忆一下，在当时舞台上曾经出现了一种专从外形动作上去模拟干部、模拟新人物的风气。为什么会发生这种模拟呢？演员们无法体会这些人物心里的喜怒哀乐，对于这些感情根本猜不透，只好从外形去下手，也只能止于外形模仿。今天呢，上面那种情况已经过去了，舞台上就出现了新人物，新感情；像范登高在回忆过去的苦难，因而悔悟现在的行为那一长段带白带唱的独自表演，就不是光有点外表的技术或是演唱的经验所能够办得到的，就必得理解这种感情，接受这种感情，自己心里有了感动才创造得出来的。这在灵芝和玉生恋爱的场面里，在玉梅对有翼的感情方面，都表现出来。就是这些人物和他们的感情在舞台上给我们留下了新鲜的印象，使我们感到社会主义的新戏曲在发芽滋长了。
    单说思想上的进步还是不够的。演员在塑造角色方面也学习了新的方法；学习了从内心去体会人物感情的重要，学习了分析人物思想性格的方法，学习了留心生活，有意识地去观察体验生活的方法。这种方法，使演员关心周围的生活，关心生活中的事变，关心人和他们的思想变化。艺术创造的新方法把他们的业务需要和对政治的关心联系起来了。在这种新的生活态度和艺术态度上才能塑造出舞台上的新人物来。
    另一方面也可以看出来，认真地学习传统也是他们成功的原因之一。
    评剧院有一个时期在某些戏里追求一种话剧舞台上的真实，像演杜十娘投江一场戏，舞台上布置了一只大船，使得本来是非常泼辣的表演变得“瘟”了。这是因为当时一些新参加戏曲工作的同志们，对于戏曲的表现手法还不熟悉的原故。这次的戏却有了不同的面貌，导演和演员们都敢于在表现崭新的题材和人物的时候大胆运用传统的手法，因而得到了相当成功。像马多寿一家人，表演都是比较夸张。这几位演员都大胆吸取了角色行当的表演方法，使得每一个人物的轮廓非常鲜明突出，像去惹不起的张玉兰同志，去糊涂涂的宋长文同志，去常有理的赵丽蓉同志，都是很成功的。但这几个同样是丑扮的人物放在一起却没有一点相同，各有各的特色，导演在这方面也大胆而成功地运用了打击乐器造成了强烈的喜剧气分。又如灵芝“算卦”那一场，在原小说上本是一种细微的心理活动，在剧本上也只是、而且也只能是心理的描写和感情的抒发，但导演却很恰当地把它行动化起来，舞蹈化起来，加上了打击乐器，使得这场戏有了新鲜活泼的面貌。整个说来人物的鲜明是这个戏的最大特色。这一方面固然和原作者的风格分不开，但也还是导演和演员敢于运用戏曲表演的明快和夸张手法的直接结果。
    这一点很有力量地给一个争论做了事实上的结论。这个争论就是：表现现代生活能不能运用戏曲的传统表现手法，特别是表演的手法，特别是以行当为基础的表演程式？这个戏的实践告诉我们：能！只要运用得恰当，只要是从剧情出发，从人物出发，一定会得到成功。不光这样，而且反证出来，凡硬搬话剧的办法，往往失去鲜明的印象，失去了效果，并且使人看了别扭。
    这是一个好戏，一个成功的戏，那是没有问题的。但为了使得舞台上新的创作更加提高起见，也还可以提出一些改进的意见。我们戏曲舞台上的许多传统剧目在艺术上那样精炼，那样完整，并不是最初一拿出来就有这么好的；它是经过了不知多少年月，多少演员的不断加工才逐渐琢磨出来的。为了创造能够和古典艺术比美的现代新艺术，我们应当对新剧目多作些加工。
    为了帮助加工，我提出一些意见供参考。
    在剧本方面，我感觉第一幕写得比较乱。在话剧编剧上，第一幕往往不容易写好，因为要介绍剧情人物，又要有戏，这就使得头绪纷繁起来，观众不容易看清楚了。评剧“三里湾”的第一幕也有这种毛病，介绍的事情和人物都太多，观众的印象不深。我们戏曲的办法就比较简单，用自报家门直接叙述出来。这种方法观众非常容易接受，是十分大众化的方法；它的缺点只在于不够戏剧化，如果不加批判地用在现代生活的戏里去就会感到不很调和。但如果我们把这种自报家门的办法用更加戏剧化的形式表现出来，就能收到又明快、又有戏的效果。其实，所谓自报家门的好处一方面，归纳起来，无非是先介绍最必要的人物和情节，而不忙着把所有主要人物和情节慌慌张张地一下子塞给观众；却让观众在以后的适宜场合逐渐去认识他所应认识的人，了解他所应了解的事。这样，故事的发展就非常自然，观众就不感觉吃力了。同样也是中国评剧院演出的“秦香莲”，一开场是香莲投店，实际上是叙述故事，但戏剧的矛盾却已经开始表现出来了。至于戏中的另一个主角陈世美，却要在闯宫中间由门官引出来。这样一来，人没有上场，观众就早已认识他了，根本用不着费力去介绍。这种又简洁又明朗的手法，应当说是戏曲遗产中的精华部分，非常群众化，因此也是非常有人民性的。
    范登高转变的一场，是不是也可以更加改进一些。现在的毛病在于全部故事都是倒叙的，舞台上叙述多，动作少，开场的时候和前一场戏在情绪上也有些不接气，显得有些松。如何改进，我还想不出好办法，只提出来供研究。
    在表演、导演和音乐方面，我觉得这次“三里湾”的整个唱腔听起来很顺，完全是评戏的味道。可以看出，经过几年的钻研学习，音乐工作者已经克服了不懂不熟的毛病，成为内行了。但如果还进一步要求，就觉得有个最大的美中不足，缺乏好唱。这在评戏的习惯来说是比较大的缺点。评戏要令观众一看再看而不厌，首先要有好唱，像评剧院的几个保留剧目如“秦香莲”、“小女婿”、“刘巧儿”等，都是有脍炙人口的几段名唱，如“闯宫”、
  “鸟入林”、“采桑叶”之类的，这回就找不出这种唱来。本来像灵芝“算卦”应当好好唱一下，但演员的歌唱艺术在这里没有给人以深刻感染。这是一个重大的损失，如果这里唱好了，会增加光彩不少。青年演员应当在这方面多多下工夫，没有这方面的工夫，演员的艺术就缺了一方面。
    导演和音乐设计当然也要担负一定的帮助“创腔”的责任。过去这完全是演员个人的事，现在艺术上既然有了统一的设计，他们就必不可少地要在这方面下些工夫。这回在歌唱上显得有些不平衡，比方演范登高的张德福同志有几段唱得很好，在和女儿吵架那一场的一段唱，的确很能表达感情，甚至博得了观众的掌声，这在发展评戏的男角唱腔方面来说也是一点成绩。但就整个的戏来看，就显得不平衡；在音乐上显得计划性还不够。最精彩的唱似乎不应当安在这里，或者这里的唱虽然也应当很好，但在戏的几个高潮地方，如灵芝“算卦”等地方，应当有比这更吸引人的好唱才能压得住。（在另一个高潮地方，范登高转变一场，是有很充分的演唱的，演员唱得也不坏。这里不能给人更深刻的感染，恐怕是和剧本的倒叙法有关。）我希望以后如果修改，还能在这方面补救一下。
    这回许多反派的脚色都演得很不错，但在演唱方面也是比较贫弱，还希望这些演员同志在这方面多加努力。
    另外，我觉得正面人物的性格还可以更突出些，或者干脆说这些人物的喜剧性还可以加强些，还可以稍微演得夸张些，色彩就会更浓了。比方灵芝那种嘀嘀咕咕的性格（赵树理同志的话）表现得强调些，比方把灵芝的知识分子气味和玉梅的爽朗性格作一个强烈的对比，一定会使得戏更好看。这回去玉梅的万晶同志演得很不错，唱得很有味。万晶同志是一个新歌剧演员改行来演评戏的，这几年的成绩相当突出。但从导演的角度来说，去玉梅的最好是一个外形健壮的大个儿演员，这就便于和灵芝那种清秀的知识分子外形对比起来，能够在四个青年人的戏上面产生更多喜剧的效果。
    去马有翼的是个有希望的青年演员，但在表演方面没有经验，显得弱一些，使得这一部分戏的色彩不够应有的鲜明。是否导演还可以多帮助他突破一些困难，使他在重点的场子，如从家里出走这些地方能有更感染人的表演呢？
    在戏曲舞台装置方面，评剧院这几年有很大的创造，做出了许多成绩。这次也还是从简洁这方面来设计的，具有朴素的风格。如马多寿家的一场景，在艺术风格上就很清新，又能紧密结合表演的要求，这是很好的。这个戏舞台美术设计的缺点就在于风格不统一。第一场外景的写实风格我们不说它了，这个问题在许多戏曲舞台上都还没能解决，不能单单向“三里湾”的设计者作过高要求，只作为一个问题提出来供舞台美术界讨论，希望能得到一些解决。另外，在范登高转变一场的那半个门，实在是一件既多余又非常不美的东西。如果说得厉害些，它是有些妨碍演员的表演和破坏观众的想像的。如果不要这半个门，只用灯光来表现的话，是否观众就分不出屋里屋外来呢？多少次的经验证明是不会的。记得延安演“白毛女”的第一幕，也有门里门外的戏，也就只有一小块片子作内景，在表演中不仅不破坏真实感，而且利用虚拟的门做了许多漂亮的身段。这些经验还是值得采取的。
