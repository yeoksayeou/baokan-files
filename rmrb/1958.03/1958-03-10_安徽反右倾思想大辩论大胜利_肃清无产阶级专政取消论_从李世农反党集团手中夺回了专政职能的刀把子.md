    Great Victory in the Anti-Rightist Ideological Debate in Anhui
    Eradicating the Theory of Abandoning the Proletarian Dictatorship
    Seizing Back the Knife Handle of the Dictatorship Function from the Li Shinong Anti-Party Clique
    (Our Hefei News) The enlarged meeting of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, held last month, achieved a major victory in the struggle between two roads. At this meeting, the right-wing anti-Party clique headed by Li Shinong, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat and Deputy Governor, was unearthed. Its members were: Yang Xiaochun, member of the Provincial Party Committee and Chief Procurator of the Provincial Procuratorate; Li Rui, member of the Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Chief Procurator of the Provincial Procuratorate; and Chen Rengang, Secretary of the Party Group and Deputy Director of the Department of Justice (who had already been exposed as a rightist).
    This meeting was held in Hefei from December 15, 1957, to January 27, 1958. Participating in the meeting were all members of the Provincial Party Committee, secretaries of Party committees at the prefectural, municipal, and county levels, Party member cadres above the level of director in provincial-level organizations, and responsible Party member cadres from all political and legal departments above the county level throughout the province, totaling 1,524 people, with 1,834 people attending as observers. Six thousand two hundred and fifty big-character posters were posted, 261 people spoke at the conference, and 920 people made written statements, conducting a vigorous airing of views, free expression of ideas, and debate. While distinguishing between right and wrong on major issues, those attending the meeting also examined and criticized their own erroneous ideas, especially right-leaning thoughts, and engaged in mutual criticism, truly achieving ideological exchange. Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out in his concluding speech: Through this meeting, a major rightist element, Li Shinong, and his anti-Party clique, who were very harmful, deeply hidden, good at pretending, and covered with a "painted skin," were unearthed. This group has been crushed by us, the leadership of the political and legal departments has returned to the hands of the Party, and this knife handle of the dictatorship function has been seized back from the hands of robbers. There is no doubt that this is a major victory for the Party. He also said: "This conference was a profound, vivid, and practical rectification conference, a rectification conference with very sharp and in-depth ideological exchange. This meeting had both anti-rightist and rectification content. Through this meeting, several major rightist elements hidden in the Party were cleared, the roots of evil that implemented the rightist program in the political and legal departments were cleared, and through debate, various erroneous ideas within the Party were powerfully criticized, ideological levels were greatly improved, and the political direction of the struggle between the two roads was corrected. This is of great significance and far-reaching impact for purifying the Party organization, enhancing Party unity, enhancing Party combat effectiveness, consolidating the socialist system, and promoting the development of the socialist cause."
    The Anhui Provincial Conference was held under the following circumstances:
    The anti-Party clique headed by the rightist Li Shinong controlled the procuratorial and judicial organs of the political and legal system, and also controlled the Party's supervisory organs and the leadership of the Provincial Anti-Rebellion Five-Person Group. For a long time, they distorted and undermined the Party's various policies on eliminating counter-revolutionaries, shielding and condoning a large number of counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements. According to preliminary statistics, under their instructions and influence, a total of more than 2,000 counter-revolutionaries and bad elements were missed in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and social suppression of counter-revolutionaries throughout the province, and those who were wrongly released in the adjudication, those who should have been sentenced but were not, and those who were lightly sentenced for serious crimes. Due to their criminal activities, many cadres were poisoned, and widespread and serious right-leaning phenomena occurred in the political and legal departments.
    In the spring of last year, the right-leaning of the political and legal departments became even more obvious. At that time, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in the countryside took advantage of temporary difficulties after natural disasters to carry out sabotage activities everywhere and incite the masses to make trouble. In response to the situation at the time, the Provincial Party Committee instructed all localities on February 26: 1. Do a good job in ensuring food supply; 2. Conduct reasoning struggles against the unfounded clamoring of some well-to-do middle peasants; 3. Resolutely strike at the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries and bad elements, and criticize and overcome the right-leaning thoughts of political and legal cadres. The Party committees at all levels correctly implemented the Provincial Party Committee's instructions, carried out various struggles against the right-leaning thoughts of the political and legal departments while correctly handling contradictions among the people, and strengthened leadership over the political and legal departments, handling a number of counter-revolutionaries and bad elements in accordance with the law. Therefore, social order was stabilized, the masses' production morale was stabilized, and cooperatives were also consolidated. From January to October last year, only more than 2,000 well-to-do middle peasant households wavered and withdrew from the cooperatives throughout the province, while more than 50,000 single-handed farmers joined the cooperatives. This shows that it was absolutely necessary for the Provincial Party Committee to put forward the anti-rightist campaign at that time, and the achievements were remarkable.
    However, in the anti-rightist struggle, the right-wing anti-Party clique, with Li Shinong as its commander, obstructed and undermined this struggle in various ways, viciously attacking the Provincial Party Committee. They incited political and legal cadres to oppose the leadership of the Party committees, and argued endlessly with the prefectural and county Party committees on the issue of anti-rightism. This enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee was convened to clarify this right-leaning thinking, and the crimes of the right-wing anti-Party clique headed by Li Shinong were exposed at this meeting.
    The right-wing anti-Party clique headed by Li Shinong deliberately weakened the functions of the proletarian dictatorship, attempting to change the nature of the revolutionary regime. When the Provincial Party Committee put forward the opposition to the right-leaning of the political and legal departments last spring, Li Shinong, as the secretary of the Secretariat and also in charge of leading the political and legal departments, did not express his attitude at the meeting, but after the meeting, he incited political and legal cadres to oppose the Provincial Party Committee's anti-rightist instructions, and sent his henchmen to "oppose the left" and "correct deviations" everywhere, even openly ordering the political and legal departments not to issue anti-rightist instructions and not to examine and criticize the right-leaning thoughts of political and legal cadres. Li Rui collected anti-Party materials in Dangtu County, Yang Xiaochun fanned the flames in Hexian County, Bengbu and other places, attacking the Provincial Party Committee's anti-rightism, and Chen Rengang arbitrarily decided to release a large number of criminals in southern Anhui and Feidong, among other places.
    In May last year, just as rightists across the country were launching a frenzied attack on the Party, the activities of the Li Shinong anti-Party clique also reached a climax. Members of this clique clamored at the propaganda conference held in May that anti-rightism was wrong and that they wanted to "seek justice" for those they considered to be "wrongfully accused." Li Shinong participated in this meeting, and he secretly supported the anti-Party elements. After the Provincial Party Committee made the conclusion at this meeting that anti-rightism was correct, Li Shinong echoed the rightists at the provincial political and legal cadre meeting held immediately on May 25, and set fire to the meeting in a big way. In his report at this meeting, he repeatedly said that he was "conveying the opinions of the Provincial Party Committee," but the content of the report completely opposed the Provincial Party Committee. In order to negate the correctness of anti-rightism, he said that "deviations" had occurred in the implementation of anti-rightist instructions, which was "related" to the Provincial Party Committee's proposal of anti-rightism. He also said that the "main responsibility" for the so-called "deviations" "should be borne by the Provincial Party Committee first."
    Thus, he overturned the achievements of anti-rightism, negated the necessity of continuing anti-rightism, and turned the meeting, which should have been an anti-rightist meeting, into an anti-"left" meeting. The fire set by Li Shinong at the political and legal meeting caused serious adverse consequences throughout the province. According to the revelation of Comrade Xu Shaolin, First Secretary of the Anqing Prefectural Committee, at that time, many counties, such as Susong, Huaining, Qianshan, and Qingyang, not only relaxed their struggle against the enemy at that time, but also released 64.5% of the prisoners in custody at once. After inspection, it was found that more than 90% of these released prisoners should not have been released. Li Shinong's report caused the thinking of many political and legal cadres throughout the province to fall into confusion again. At this enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, it was revealed that Chen Rengang not only wrote several letters to Li Shinong last year attacking the Provincial Party Committee, but even Li Shinong's report at the political and legal cadre meeting was discussed with Chen Rengang. This exposed how the right-wing anti-Party clique headed by Li Shinong was opposing the Provincial Party Committee in a planned and organized way.
    According to the revelations of the meeting, the crimes of the Li Shinong right-wing anti-Party clique in shielding and condoning counter-revolutionaries and bad elements in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and social suppression of counter-revolutionaries were even more heinous. Li Shinong believed that we were "too cruel to counter-revolutionaries and should be more kind." In order to disarm the dictatorship weapon, he actually said at the political and legal cadre meeting: "If the remaining counter-revolutionaries mobilize the masses to arrest them, I guarantee that not even one will be caught." Yang Xiaochun negated the achievements of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, falsely accusing the suppression of counter-revolutionaries of committing the error of expansion. Li Rui used his authority to fabricate various reasons to exonerate counter-revolutionaries and bad elements, describing solid evidence as "insufficient evidence," describing political issues as "ideological issues," and describing enemy-us issues as "internal issues of the people." Moreover, for counter-revolutionaries and bad elements who should have been arrested and sentenced, regardless of the nature and circumstances of the crime, they often refused to approve arrests and prosecutions on the grounds of "already confessed," "occasional offense," "young," "attempted," "not serious consequences," and so on. Li Shinong advocated putting "leniency for confession" in the first place, while Yang Xiaochun tampered with the central government's policy to "leniency for confession, meritorious service for atonement, and rewards for great meritorious service," without mentioning "severity for resistance." They created various fallacies to condone the enemy, saying that counter-revolutionaries still had "two sides," saying that counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks "worked one more year in our ranks is equivalent to atoning for one more year of crime," and that sentences could be reduced when sentencing. Li Shinong also personally formulated cases of light sentences for serious crimes for the whole province to follow. Li Shinong and Yang Xiaochun carried out various activities on the already judged case of counter-revolutionary Liu Xiushan. They deleted the facts about participating in the killing of revolutionary masses and persecuting families of revolutionary soldiers after the defection from the conclusion of the Liu case, changed "defection from the revolution" to "departure from the revolution," and reported to the central government in an attempt to overturn the case for Liu Xiushan. They insisted that Cao Ye, a counter-revolutionary who had infiltrated our organization, had two sides and changed his conclusion to a good person.
    According to the statistics of the materials revealed at the meeting, under the influence of this anti-Party clique, the procuratorates at all levels throughout the province, in just one year last year, more than 1,000 counter-revolutionaries and bad elements should have been arrested but were not, and should have been prosecuted but were not. Among them, Yang Xiaochun personally approved the leniency of more than 100 people, and Li Rui approved the leniency of more than 30 people.
    Among Li Rui's brothers, three older brothers were all counter-revolutionaries with bloody debts and great popular resentment. Li Rui actually shielded them and even introduced them to jobs. For several years, people had been constantly reporting Li Rui's crimes, but Li Shinong and Yang Xiaochun had covered them up.
    Li Shinong not only undermined the dictatorship weapon, but also used his authority as the Minister of the Organization Department of the Party Committee before 1953, and later as the leader of the review of cadres, to fundamentally corrupt the Party organization in an attempt to change the nature of the Party. He tampered with the central government's principles for the review and treatment of self-surrendered defectors: "Strict ideological criticism, lenient organizational treatment," to "Strict ideological exposure and criticism, lenient conclusion treatment." Based on this principle of his, he used his authority in December 1956 to delete and modify the review conclusions of four cadres with serious self-surrender and defection behaviors. He even changed "disloyal to the Party" in the conclusion to "loyal to the Party." At that time, the person in charge of the cadre review office disagreed with his deletion and modification and showed him the relevant documents of the central government. Li Shinong actually said: "These words are too stimulating. It doesn't matter if they are not written in the conclusion. I am old, you are still young, you can remember it even if I die."
    In order to cover up his anti-Party conspiracy, Li Shinong also created many fallacies, such as the theory of the extinction of class struggle and the theory of the abolition of the proletarian dictatorship. He said at the departmental meeting of the Provincial Party Committee's Organization Department in 1953: "There will probably be no more large-scale social reform movements in the future," "Affirmatively speaking, we can no longer have a movement to engage in ideological work in the future." In 1956, he said again: "After cooperativization, it is certain that there is no longer a struggle between two roads." Regarding the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, he believed that "after socialist transformation, it has become a non-antagonistic contradiction." He also said many flattering words to the bourgeoisie at the executive committee of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce in January 1956, wanting to describe the five poisonous behaviors of the bourgeoisie during the Three-Anti Campaign as "the influence of spontaneous forces" and "not conscious," and described the bourgeoisie's acceptance of socialist transformation as "completely voluntary." Therefore, in his report at the political and legal meeting on May 25 last year, he did not mention that there was still class struggle at all. He only believed that "the struggle in the future is the struggle between new and old ideas," "the main target of the dictatorship in the future is to fight against various criminal offenders." He also confused the two types of contradictions, believing that obvious contradictions between the enemy and us were also contradictions among the people, denying that we and the bourgeoisie still had an antagonistic side in the contradictions among the people, and unilaterally placed the responsibility for the transformation of contradictions on our side. On April 13 last year, he reported at the Provincial Supervisory Conference: "The landlords are reforming well. Although there are antagonistic contradictions with me, after the transformation, they have been transformed into non-antagonistic contradictions. If comrades do not realize this, they will rectify these people at the slightest sign of trouble. This kind of indiscriminate action will lead to deviations. If you force him to a dead end, the non-antagonistic contradiction will be transformed into an antagonistic contradiction." This is completely consistent with the reactionary argument that "class struggle is created by the communists."
    The materials revealed at the meeting also proved that, in order to carry out his anti-Party activities, Li Shinong always tried his best to drag the Party's cause forward, and he would promote regression whenever he had the opportunity. The "three reforms in agriculture" proposed by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China had been effective in practice. In the past few years, grain production had increased by more than 7.5 billion catties simply because of the implementation of the "three reforms." It not only pointed out the direction of efforts to change the face of Anhui, but also encouraged the cadres and masses of the province to fight against nature with courage. However, Li Shinong did not like such a good thing. The Provincial Party Committee proposed in the "three reforms" to expand the summer harvest area, increase the multiple cropping index, and plant high-yield crops. However, he asked the cadres below not to emphasize expanding the summer harvest area, not to increase the multiple cropping index, to leave more spring land, not to plant more high-yield crops, and to plant more low-yield crops such as sorghum, and incited the cadres below not to implement the Provincial Party Committee's instructions. For example, when he went to Dingyuan last year, he said to Lu Xiang, the secretary of the County Party Committee: "The instructions of the Provincial Party Committee are not necessarily correct. Regarding production issues, you can handle them according to your situation." Li Shinong's obstruction and sabotage of the development of socialist construction in Anhui was driven by political ambition. In July 1950, he secretly used the opportunity of rectification to viciously attack the various work of the district Party committee and the responsible comrades of the district Party committee by using the names of certain comrades in the form of group conclusions, undermining the leadership of the district Party committee. In 1953, he echoed with ambitious people, and in front of the secretary of the prefectural party committee, he tried his best to attack the core leadership of the provincial party committee, attempting to undermine the prestige of the party's responsible persons and the party's unity. At that time, it aroused great indignation among the comrades.
    In order to win the trust of the masses and cultivate his own forces so as to realize his political ambitions, Li Shinong also carried out various disguises. When he served as the Deputy Secretary of the Wanbei District Committee and Secretary of the Direct Affiliated Party Committee in 1950, he also played a trick of selecting model party members, personally arranging the list of candidates, putting himself in the first place, and stealing the title of "model party member." Yang Xiaochun, Li Rui, Chen Rengang and other rightists even boasted everywhere that Li Shinong was simple, gentle, and steady, and was the best of the provincial party committee secretaries. He concealed his class background and the punishments he had received, deceiving the organization; he often boasted that he had "surplus virtue," and that "thrift and gentleness were his nature." However, all his life enjoyment was actually better than that of cadres of the same level. He usually traveled by car, but deliberately walked to show people when he held a general meeting; he always wanted to eat well when he went to the countryside, but he always criticized people for wasting after eating; he insisted that the public install heating for his nanny's house, and did not think it was a waste, but he criticized others for wasting if they used an extra match to light a cigarette. All these disguises were torn off after the revelations of this meeting, and it turned out to be a painted skin of a political careerist.
    The members of the Li Shinong anti-Party clique were all from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds. Although they entered the Party and received long-term education from the Party, they did not abandon their reactionary stand or change their reactionary nature. Li Shinong and Li Rui both felt unhappy about their families being struggled against during the land reform, and Li Rui even cried bitterly and could not concentrate on his work. Yang Xiaochun used his authority to shield and cover up his bully landlord and counter-revolutionary father-in-law, Zhou Zhongheng, so that he escaped the net in the struggles against bullying, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The Party gave them multiple education and criticisms for their mistakes. Li Shinong was administratively punished in 1944 for believing the false accusations of defectors in Tiangao County and wrongly accusing many good people; he was severely criticized by the Party in Huainan in 1947 for committing the error of "escapeism"; after liberation, the Provincial Party Committee sharply criticized his self-proclaimed "model" and hypocritical style several times; especially since last year, the Party has repeatedly criticized Li Shinong, Yang Xiaochun, etc., patiently waiting for them to consciously confess. But they had no intention of repenting and were willing to cut themselves off from the Party. Their crimes and attitude of resistance aroused the great indignation of those attending the meeting, and they unanimously demanded that they be given serious treatment.
    The Sixth Plenary Meeting of the Enlarged Committee of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China unanimously passed a resolution expelling the rightists Li Shinong, Yang Xiaochun, and Li Rui from the Party, revoking all their positions in the Party, and recommending that relevant parties revoke all their positions outside the Party, and hand over their crimes of condoning counter-revolutionaries to the Supervisory Committee for handling. The meeting resolution also pointed out the direction in which Party organizations at all levels and all Party members throughout the province should strive to further consolidate the Party's unity and unification under the leadership of the Central Committee, purify the Party organization, and enhance the Party's combat effectiveness.
    Those attending the meeting all expressed their firm support for this resolution. They realized the harm of liberalism in the serious class struggle and expressed that they would thoroughly transform their thinking, stand firm on the Party's position, and defend the Party's cause. There were quite a few people who had been deceived by Li Shinong's disguise. At this meeting, they all reviewed their past mistakes of only looking at the phenomenon and not the essence, and said that they would strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and improve their political sense of smell. People with serious individualistic thoughts also further realized that individualism is the root of all evils for Party members, and they checked their mistakes one after another. Everyone expressed their determination to continue to thoroughly correct their mistakes and shortcomings, and to work hard and wholeheartedly for the construction of socialism.

    安徽反右倾思想大辩论大胜利
    肃清无产阶级专政取消论
    从李世农反党集团手中夺回了专政职能的刀把子
    本报合肥讯　上月举行的中共安徽省委扩大会议，取得了两条道路斗争的重大胜利。在这次会议上，挖出了以省委书记处书记、副省长李世农为首的右派反党集团，它的成员是：省委委员、省检察院检察长杨效椿，省委委员、省检察院副检察长李锐，司法厅党组书记、副厅长陈仁刚（已被揭发的右派分子）。
    这次会议，是1957年12月15日到1958年1月27日在合肥举行的。参加这次会议的，有省委全体委员，地、市、县各级党委书记、省直属机关处长以上党员干部，及全省县级以上政法各部门的党员负责干部，共一千五百二十四人，列席一千八百三十四人；贴大字报六千二百五十张，在大会上口头发言的有二百六十一人，书面发言的九百二十人，进行了大放大鸣大辩论。出席会议的人在分清大是大非的同时，都检查批判了自己的错误思想，特别是右倾思想，并进行了互相批评，真正做到思想交锋。中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣同志在总结发言中指出：通过这次会议，挖出了一个危害很大、隐藏很深、善于装模作样、蒙有一层“画皮”的大右派分子李世农及其反党集团。这个集团已为我们所粉碎，政法部门的领导权已重新回到党的手里，这个专政职能的刀把子已从强盗手中夺回来了。毫无疑问，这是党的一个重大胜利。他还说：“这次大会是一个深刻的生动实际的整风大会，是一个思想交锋十分尖锐而深入的整风大会。这次会议既有反右派的内容，也有整改的内容。经过这次会议，清除了隐藏在党内的几个大右派分子，清除了在政法部门中执行右派纲领的孽根，并且通过辩论，有力地批判了党内各种错误思想，大大提高了思想水平，端正了两条道路斗争的政治方向。这对于纯洁党的组织，增强党的团结，提高党的战斗力，巩固社会主义制度，促进社会主义事业的发展，都具有重大的意义和深远的影响。”
    安徽省这次会议，是在这样的情况下举行的：
    以右派分子李世农为首的反党集团，把持了政法系统的检察和司法机构，还把持了党的监察机构和省肃反五人小组的领导，长期以来便歪曲和破坏了党的关于肃清反革命的各项政策，包庇和宽纵了大批反革命分子和其他坏分子。据初步统计，在他们指示和影响下，全省肃反和社会镇反中漏掉的和定案中错放的、该判不判的和重罪轻判的反革命及坏分子，共达二千多名；由于他们的罪恶活动，使不少干部受到了毒害，使政法部门产生了普遍而又严重的右倾现象。
    在去年春天，政法部门的右倾更加明显地暴露出来。当时，农村中的地主富农分子和反革命、坏分子，利用受自然灾害后的暂时困难，到处进行破坏活动，煽动群众闹事。省委针对当时情况于2月26日指示各地：1、确实作好粮食供应工作；2、对某些富裕中农的无故叫喊要进行说理斗争；3、对反革命分子、坏分子的破坏行为，要坚决予以打击，要批判和克服政法干部中的右倾思想。各地党委正确地执行了省委这一指示，在正确处理人民内部矛盾的同时，和政法部门的右倾思想进行了各种斗争，加强了对政法部门的领导，依法处理了一批反革命分子和坏分子。因此，稳定了社会秩序，稳定了群众的生产情绪，合作社也得到了巩固。全省去年1到10月，动摇退社的富裕中农只二千多户，而入社的单干农民却有五万多户。这说明当时省委提出反右倾是十分必要的，成绩是显著的。
    但是，在反右倾的斗争中以李世农为统帅的右派反党集团，却多方阻挠和破坏这个斗争，恶毒地向省委进攻。他们煽动政法干部反对党委的领导，在反右倾问题上和地、县党委喋喋不休地进行争论。这次省委扩大会议，就是为了澄清这种右倾思想召开的，而以李世农为首的右派反党集团的罪行，也就在这次会议上被揭露了出来。
    以李世农为首的右派反党集团，蓄意削弱无产阶级专政的职能，妄图使革命政权变质。去年春天省委提出反对政法部门右倾的时候，李世农身为书记处书记，又分工领导政法部门，他在会议上却不表示态度，会后竟鼓动政法干部反对省委的反右指示，并派出爪牙到处“反左”“纠偏”，甚至公然责成政法部门不许将反右指示下达，不要检查批判政法干部的右倾思想。李锐在当涂县搜集反党材料，杨效椿在和县、蚌埠等地煽风点火，攻击省委反右，陈仁刚则在皖南、肥东等地擅自决定释放大批罪犯。
    去年5月，正当全国各地右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，李世农反党集团的活动也达到了高潮。这个集团的成员在5月召开的宣传会议上，大肆叫嚣反右反错了，要为他们认为“被冤屈”的人“喊冤”。李世农参加了这一会议，他对反党分子暗暗支持。当省委在这个会上作了反右倾是正确的结论以后，李世农在紧接着5月25日召开的全省政法干部会议上，就和右派唱和起来，大肆放火。他在这个会议的报告中，口口声声说是在“传达省委意见”，但报告的内容，却完全反对省委。他为了否定反右的正确性，说执行反右指示中出现了“偏差”，与省委提出反右“有关”。又说出现所谓“偏差”的“主要责任首先由省委负责”。
    于是他把反右的成绩推翻了，把继续反右的必要否定了，把本来应该反右的会议一变而成了反“左”的会议。李世农在政法会议上放的火，在全省造成了严重恶果。据安庆地委第一书记许少林同志揭发，当时有许多县如宿松、怀宁、潜山、青阳等县，不但放松了当时对敌斗争，并且一下放掉了64.5％的在押罪犯，后经检查，这些放掉的罪犯，90％以上都是不该放的。李世农的报告，使全省很多政法干部的思想又重新陷于混乱。这次省委扩大会上，揭露出陈仁刚在去年不但给李世农几次写信攻击省委，而且连李世农在政法干部会议上的报告，都是和陈仁刚商量过的。这就暴露了以李世农为首的右派反党集团，是怎样有计划、有组织地在反对省委了。
    根据会议的揭发，李世农右派反党集团在肃反和社会镇反方面包庇和纵容反革命、坏分子的罪行更加令人发指。李世农认为，我们“对反革命分子太残忍了，应该仁慈一些”。他为了解除专政武器，竟在政法干部会上说：“残余反革命如果发动群众来捉，保险一个也捉不到。”杨效椿则否定肃反工作成绩，诬蔑肃反犯了扩大化的错误。李锐则利用职权，捏造各种理由为反、坏分子开脱罪责，他把证据确凿，说成“证据不足”，把政治问题说成“思想问题”，把敌我问题说成“人民内部问题”而且对该捕该判的反、坏分子，不管犯罪性质和情节如何，往往以“已经交代”“偶犯”“年轻”“未遂”“后果不严重”等等为理由，拒绝批捕和起诉。李世农主张把“坦白从宽”放在首要地位，而杨效椿则把中央的政策篡改为“坦白从宽，立功折罪，立大功受奖”，根本不提“抗拒从严”。他们制造各种谬论宽纵敌人。说什么反革命分子还有“两面性”，说混入革命队伍的反革命分子“在我们内部多干一年工作就等于多赎一年罪”，在定案判刑时可以减刑。李世农还亲自制订了重罪轻判的案例要全省仿行。李世农和杨效椿对已判的刘秀山反革命案进行种种活动，他们把刘案结论中关于叛变后参与杀害革命群众、迫害革命军人家属等罪恶事实删掉，把“叛变革命”改为“脱离革命”，上报中央，企图为刘秀山翻案。他们硬说混入我机关的反革命分子曹野有两面性，将他改定为好人。
    据会议揭发的材料统计，在这个反党集团影响下，全省各级检察院，只是去年一年，该批捕而不批捕，该批准起诉而不批准起诉的反革命分子和坏分子就有一千多人。其中杨效椿亲自审批宽纵的一百多人，李锐审批宽纵的三十多人。
    李锐的兄弟中，有三个哥哥都是血债累累、民愤很大的反革命分子，李锐竟然对他们加以包庇，甚至为他们介绍工作。几年来曾不断有人检举李锐的罪行，但是李世农、杨效椿都把它掩盖了下来。
    李世农不但破坏专政武器，还利用1953年以前先后担任党委组织部长，以及以后负责领导审干工作等的职权，从根本上腐蚀党组织，企图改变党的性质。他把中央对自首叛变分子的审查处理原则“思想批判从严，组织处理从宽”，篡改为“思想揭发、批判从严，结论处理从宽”。他根据自己的这个原则，在1956年12月利用职权删改了有严重自首叛变行为的四个干部的审查结论。甚至把结论中“对党不忠实”改成为“对党忠实”；当时审干办公室的负责人对他这种删改不同意，并把中央有关文件给他看，李世农竟说：“这些字句太刺激了，不写在结论上，也不要紧，我年纪大了，你们还年轻，我死了你们还能记得就算了。”
    李世农为了掩护反党阴谋，还制造了许多谬论，如阶级斗争熄灭论和无产阶级专政取消论。他在1953年省委组织部的部务会议上说：“今后大规模的社会改革运动恐怕没有了”，“肯定地讲，今后无论如何不能再来一个运动搞思想工作了”。1956年他又说：“合作化后，肯定地已经没有两条道路的斗争了”。对无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾问题，他则认为“经过社会主义改造，已变成非对抗性的矛盾了”。他还在1956年1月省工商联执委会上，说了许多对资产阶级吹捧的话，要把三反时资产阶级的五毒行为说成“是自发势力的影响”，并“不是自觉的”，把资产阶级接受社会主义改造，说成是“完全出于自愿”。因此，他在去年5月25日的政法会议报告中根本不提还有阶级斗争，他只认为“今后的斗争是新旧思想的斗争”，“今后专政的主要对象是同各种刑事罪犯作斗争”。他还混淆两类矛盾，把明显的敌我矛盾也认为是人民内部矛盾，否认人民内部矛盾中我们和资产阶级还有对抗的一面，把矛盾转化的责任片面放在我们一面。去年4月13日，他在省监察会议上报告说：“地主改造很好，虽与我有对抗性矛盾，但经过改造，已转为非对抗性矛盾。同志们认识不到这一点，一遇风吹草动，就整这些人，这样不分青红皂白，是会出偏差的，你逼他无路可走，就由非对抗性矛盾转化为对抗性矛盾了。”这和反动派说“阶级斗争是共产党人制造的”的论调是完全一致的。
    会议揭发的材料还证明：李世农为了进行其反党活动，总是尽力拉着党的事业前进的后腿，有机会就促退。中共安徽省委提出的“农业上的三项改革”办法在实践中已著有成效，几年来，只是因为推行“三改”，就增产粮食达七十五亿多斤。它不但指出了改变安徽面貌的努力方向，而且鼓舞了全省干部和群众向自然作斗争的勇气。但是李世农对这样的好事，是看得很不顺眼的。省委在“三改”中提出，要扩大夏收面积，提高复种指数，种植高产作物，他却要下面干部不要强调扩大夏收面积，不要提高复种指数，要多留春地，不要多种高产作物，要多种高粱等低产作物，并煽动下面干部不要执行省委指示。如他去年到定远时，就对县委书记陆祥说：“省委指示不一定正确，关于生产上的问题，你们可以按照你们的情况去办。”李世农所以这样阻挠和破坏安徽的社会主义建设的发展，是有政治野心的。1950年7月，他就背着皖北区党委负责同志，利用整风机会，盗用某些同志的名义，通过小组结论形式，对区党委的各项工作和对区党委负责同志进行恶毒的攻击，破坏区党委的领导。1953年他又和有野心的人一唱一和，在地委书记面前竭力攻击省委领导核心，妄图破坏党的负责人的威信和党的团结。当时曾引起同志们很大的义愤。
    李世农为了骗取群众信任，培养自己的势力，以便于实现他的政治野心，还进行各种伪装。他在1950年任皖北区党委副书记兼直属党委书记时，还玩了一套评选模范党员的把戏，亲自摆布候选名单，把自己列为第一名，窃取了“模范党员”的称号。杨效椿、李锐、陈仁刚等右派分子更到处吹嘘李世农朴实、温和、稳重，是省委书记中最好的一个。他隐瞒自己的阶级成分和所受的处分，欺骗组织；他常常自诩“德有余”，“俭朴和温和是天性”。但是他的一切生活享受和同级干部相比较实有过之无不及。他平时出入都坐汽车，在开大会时却故意走路给人家看；下乡总要吃好的，但吃了总要批评人家浪费；他硬要公家为他的保姆住房安装暖气，并不认为浪费，而对别人抽烟多擦了一根火柴，就批评是浪费。所有这些伪装，经过这次会议的揭发，才撕了下来，原来是一张政治野心家的画皮。
    李世农反党集团的成员都是地主、富农出身。他们进入党内，虽经党的长期教育，并未放弃反动立场，改变反动本质。李世农、李锐对土改时家庭被斗，都曾感到不愉快，李锐更是痛哭流涕，工作不安心。杨效椿利用职权包庇、掩护他的恶霸地主、反革命岳父周钟衡，使在反霸、土改、镇反、肃反斗争中都漏了网。党对他们的错误是给予过多次教育批评的。李世农1944年曾因在天高县听信叛变分子的诬告，冤枉了许多好人，受到行政处分；1947年在淮南曾因犯了“逃跑主义”的错误，受到党的严格批评；解放以后，省委又几次对他自封“模范”和虚伪的作风进行过尖锐批评；特别是去年以来，党对李世农、杨效椿等都进行过多次批评，耐心等待他们自觉地交代。但他们却毫无悔过之意，甘心自绝于党。他们的罪行和抗拒态度，激起了出席会议的人的万分愤慨，一致要求给予他们以严肃的处理。
    中共安徽省委扩大的第六次全体会议一致通过决议，开除了右派分子李世农、杨效椿、李锐的党籍，撤销他们在党内的一切职务，建议有关方面撤销他们党外的一切职务，并对他们宽纵反革命的罪行，交监委处理。会议决议还指出了全省各级党组织和全体党员，为进一步巩固党在中央领导下的团结和统一，纯洁党的组织，增强党的战斗力应当努力的方向。
    出席会议的人，都表示坚决拥护这个决议。他们认识到了在严肃的阶级斗争中，自由主义的危害性，并表示要彻底改造自己的思想，站稳党的立场，保卫党的事业。曾经被李世农的伪装所蒙蔽的人，是相当多的。他们在这次会上都检讨了自己过去只看现象不看本质的错误，要加强马列主义学习，提高政治嗅觉。有严重个人主义思想的人，也进一步认识到了个人主义对于党员说来，乃是万恶的根源，纷纷检查自己的错误。大家都表示决心要继续彻底改正自己的错误缺点，鼓起干劲，全心全意为建设社会主义努力。
