Xinhua News Agency, Prague, The "Red Right Newspaper" said on the 21st, when discussing the situation of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres, that the Czechoslovak government has recently approved the establishment of government ministries, and now decisions must be made on the transfer of cadres. All work should be completed by the end of June this year.
    The newspaper, in an editorial, called for doing a good job in streamlining institutions and transferring cadres. The editorial said that the realization of the reorganization of the national economy not only makes it possible, but also necessary, to tighten the excessively large state administrative organs and enterprise management institutions. The main purpose of streamlining institutions is to send surplus staff to places where the national economy needs them. At present, many production units and regions are in urgent need of a large number of technical personnel and workers.
    The editorial pointed out that streamlining institutions and transferring cadres is a very detailed work. The editorial requires relevant departments to conduct individual talks with the laid-off personnel to make them understand the significance of the matter, and also to try to solve the difficulties of the transferred personnel.

    捷“红色权利报”发表社论
    号召做好精简下放工作
    新华社布拉格电　“红色权利报”21日在谈到精简机构和干部下放的情况时说，捷克斯洛伐克政府最近已经通过了政府各部的编制，现在必须对干部调动作出决定。全部工作应当在今年6月底结束。
    这家报纸在一篇社论中要求做好精简机构和干部下放的工作。社论说，国民经济改组的实现不但使得有可能、而且也有必要紧缩过于庞大的国家行政机关和企业管理机构。精简机构的主要目的在于把多余的工作人员送到国民经济需要的地方去。现在有不少生产单位和地区极需补充大量技术人员和工人。
    社论指出，精简机构和干部下放是很细致的工作。社论要求有关部门必须同编余人员进行个别谈话，使他们理解这件事的意义，同时也要设法解决下放人员的困难。
