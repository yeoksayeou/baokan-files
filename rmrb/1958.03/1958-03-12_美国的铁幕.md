American Black Curtain

    America's Iron Curtain
    The Pitiful "Uncrowned Kings"
    In the United States, where fascist rule is increasingly strengthened, newspaper reporters, once hailed as "uncrowned kings," are becoming increasingly pitiful. Not long ago, incidents of arresting reporters and photographers occurred in Pennsylvania. Reporters in Wyoming are subjected to open intimidation. At a government meeting in Sarasota, Florida, reporters who went to cover the event were driven out by the police.
    The above examples are cited by Newton, the editor-in-chief of the "Tribune" in Tampa, Florida, in an article published in the February 18th issue of "Perspective" magazine. Newton also cited many other examples of reporters being barred from attending meetings and having their coverage interfered with, pointing out that these cases fairly represent the growing trend of the U.S. government to expand the scope of secrecy and block news today.
    The Truth About "Freedom of the Press"
    In this article entitled "America's Iron Curtain," Newton reveals that the U.S. government is using "secrecy" as an excuse to try its best to block news, and even the deceptive bourgeois freedom of the press is about to be completely abandoned. As early as September 25, 1951, Truman issued Executive Order 10-290, giving all government officials in Washington the power to withhold news in the name of so-called "national security." Later, this order was widely abused. At the end of 1953, the U.S. Department of Defense stamped almost everything in the Pentagon except toilet paper with the mark "For Official Use Only." Subsequently, other agencies followed suit. Robert Cutler, Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, even said without reservation: "Only government officials have the right to understand the situation. As for the common people, they can only be told after a decision has been made."
    In the U.S. Congress, which is hailed as a body of public opinion, the situation of news blockade is also very serious. More than 1,200 meetings of Congress and its various specialized committees each year are closed to the press and the public. Many meetings unrelated to military secrets are also strictly confidential. For example, the Congressional Housing Committee held 200 meetings last year, the vast majority of which were held in secret. Even issues such as how much foreign exchange members of Congress spent on foreign travel are not allowed to be known by the press.
    Under the strict news blockade, this American newspaper editor-in-chief had to admit that although American newspapers publish millions of pieces of news every day, "it is very doubtful whether the American people can obtain the truth."
    Who Benefits?
    From Newton's article, it can also be seen that stepping up the news blockade is an important means for the U.S. government to safeguard the interests of monopoly capital and cover up corruption scandals.
    Monopoly groups often obtain blocked news from their agents in the government for speculative activities. For example, when the Civil Aeronautics Board decided to allow Northeast Airlines to fly the profitable New York-Miami route, the news was suppressed for a week before it was published, and during this period, the stock of Northeast Airlines rose. This incident proved that someone made a fortune from leaking the news.
    Newton also revealed examples of U.S. government officials being afraid to publish news because of a guilty conscience. Illinois State Auditor Orville Hodge refused to allow a reporter from the "Chicago Daily News" to see his records. It was later revealed that this auditor had embezzled $2 million in state property. When the U.S. government refused to disclose the pension situation of former members of Congress to the press, it excused itself by saying that it was a matter of private income. Later, it was learned that some members of Congress and officials engaged in corruption and bribery by tampering with and forging official documents. For example, one former member of Congress used this method to spend only $10 to get a pension of $444 per year. A former government employee spent only $64 to increase his pension from $1,400 to $3,612 per year. Another employee, who only worked in Congress for one month, spent $37 to get a pension of $720 per year.

专栏：美国黑幕

    美国的铁幕
    可怜的“无冕之王”
    在法西斯统治日益加强的美国，曾经号称为“无冕之王”的新闻记者也越来越可怜了。不久以前，在宾夕法尼亚州发生了逮捕记者和摄影师的事件。怀俄明州的记者受到公开的恫吓。在佛罗里达州的沙拉锁达市的一次政府会议上，前去采访的记者竟被警察驱逐出场。
    以上这几个例子，是佛罗里达州旦巴市“论坛报”总编辑纽顿在2月18日“展望”杂志上发表的一篇文章中列举的。纽顿还列举了许多其他关于记者被禁止参加会议和采访受到干涉的例子，并且指出，这些事例足以公平地代表今日美国政府日益扩大保密范围和封锁新闻的趋势。
    “新闻自由”的真相
    纽顿在这篇题为“美国的铁幕”的文章中透露，美国政府正在以“保密”为借口，竭力封锁新闻，连欺骗性的资产阶级新闻自由也快要完全抛掉了。早在1951年9月25日，杜鲁门发布了10—290号行政命令，在所谓“国家安全”的名义下，给予华盛顿所有政府官员扣压新闻的权力。后来，这项命令竟被广泛地滥用。1953年底，美国国防部把五角大楼除了大便纸以外的几乎一切用具都盖上“只限官用”的印。接着，其他机关也相继效尤。美国总统国防安全事务特别助理罗伯特·卡特勒更毫不隐讳地说：“只有政府官员才有了解情况的权利。对于老百姓，要等到作出决定后，才可告诉他们。”
    在号称为民意机关的美国国会，封锁新闻的情况也非常严重。国会及其所属各专门委员会每年有一千二百个以上的会议是禁止报界和公众旁听的。许多无关军事机密的会议也严格保密。例如国会的房屋专门委员会去年开了二百次会议，绝大多数都是秘密举行的。甚至像议员们在国外旅行花了多少外汇这类问题，也不让新闻界知道。
    在新闻严密封锁的情况下，这位美国报纸总编辑也不得不承认，美国报纸虽然连篇累牍地刊载了数以百万计的新闻，“然而，美国人民是否能获得事实的真相呢，这是十分可疑的。”
    对谁有利
    从纽顿的文章中也可以看出，加紧进行新闻封锁，是美国政府维护垄断资本利益和掩饰贪污丑闻的重要手段。
    垄断集团常常从它在政府中的代理人那里获得被封锁的新闻，进行投机活动。例如，当民用航空局作出允许东北航空公司在有利可图的纽约—迈阿密航线飞行时，这个消息曾经压了一个星期才发表，而在这个期间，东北航空公司的股票便告上涨。这件事证明有人从走漏消息中发了财。
    纽顿还透露了美国政府官员因做贼心虚而不敢公布新闻的事例。伊利诺斯州的查账员奥佛尔·荷奇拒绝“芝加哥每日新闻”的记者看他的记录材料。后来据揭发，这个查账员盗窃了国家财产二百万美元。美国政府拒绝向报界公布前议员们的养老金情况时，借口说这是私人收入问题。后来才知道，有的议员和官员用窜改和伪造公文记录的办法营私舞弊。例如，一个前议员用这个办法只花了十美元就使自己得到每年四百四十四美元的养老金。一个前政府职员仅花了六十四美元的费用，就把自己的养老金从每年一千四百美元提高到三千六百一十二美元。另外一个职员，只在国会工作了一个月，花了三十七元费用，就使自己获得每年七百二十元的养老金。　（梅）（附图片）
