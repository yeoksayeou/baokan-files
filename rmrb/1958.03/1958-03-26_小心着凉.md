A reporter asked the West German Economics Minister Erhard, who was visiting the United States, whether the U.S. economic recession would lead to a decline in the West German economy.

Erhard replied that West Germany was not experiencing a recession; on the contrary, the "too hot weather" in the West German economy was now "a little cooler," which he was quite pleased about.

Let's take a look at how West Germany has "cooled down a little." In January of this year, export orders for West German factories decreased by 7% compared to January of last year. Production in West Germany's machine manufacturing industry has shrunk by 19% for the first time since the war. In the Ruhr, unsold coal is piling up like mountains, and the number of unemployed workers has reached 1.325 million, the highest point in four years.

Things are clearly not good, but Erhard insists on putting on an act, saying that "too hot weather has cooled down a little." But Erhard's trick is not clever. A few months ago, the ruling figures of the U.S. ruling bloc also said that the U.S. economy was not declining, but needed to "catch its breath" because it was running too fast, and so on. However, when the number of unemployed exceeded the five million mark, they were so frightened that they were thrown into a panic.

    小心着凉
    有记者问目前正在美国的西德经济部长艾哈德：美国的经济衰退是否会促使西德经济下降。
    艾哈德回答说：目前西德并没有出现衰退现象，相反，只是西德经济中“过于炎热的天气现在凉爽了一点”，他倒感到很高兴。
    不妨看一下西德如何“凉爽了一点”。今年1月西德各工厂的出口订货比去年1月减少了7％。西德机器制造业的生产自战后以来第一次缩小了19％。在鲁尔卖不出的煤堆积如山，失业的工人达到一百三十二万五千人，为四年来的最高点。
    事情明明不妙了，艾哈德却偏要装腔作势，说什么“过于炎热的天气凉爽了一点”。但是艾哈德的这种手法并不高明。几个月前美国统治集团的当权人物们也曾说，美国经济不是下降，是因为跑得太快了需要“喘口气”等等。然而，当失业人数一过五百万大关，他们就被吓得手忙脚乱，惊慌失措了。
