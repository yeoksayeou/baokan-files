    Responding to the Party's Resolution, Promoting Agricultural Upsurge
    Soviet Youth Eagerly Go to the Countryside to Become Farmers
    Rural Youth Launch Manure Accumulation Competition to Welcome Spring Ploughing
    (Dispatch from our newspaper) The resolution on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations, passed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at its February plenary session, has aroused the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of Soviet farmers. In the nationwide discussion among the people, urban and rural youth are unwilling to lag behind, and have expressed their willingness to respond to the Central Committee's resolution with practical actions, contributing to the further upsurge of agriculture.
    In Kuibyshev Oblast, the youth of factories are preparing to repair old machines that are no longer needed in the factories and send them to the collective farms. Young construction workers plan to organize work teams to help the collective farms build garages and repair shops. The Oblast's Communist Youth League organization has decided to send 500 young workers who have studied at technical schools to work in the countryside. The youth were very excited when they heard the news, and submitted applications one after another, striving to go to the countryside as agricultural laborers. In particular, many young workers who grew up in the countryside are more willing to return to the countryside and dedicate their skills to the construction of their hometowns.
    The enthusiasm of rural youth is even greater. For example, the Moscow Oblast has launched a Oblast-wide youth manure accumulation competition. The youth put forward the slogan that they would send two million tons of fertilizer to the fields by April 15, the opening day of the Communist Youth League Congress. The "Activist" collective farm organized a youth manure accumulation team, with each member transporting an average of 20 tons of manure per day. In order to prepare for spring ploughing, the young agricultural laborers of the Dmitrov district specially organized fifteen animal-powered manure transportation teams. In this matter, the youth also personally experienced the wisdom of the CPSU Central Committee's resolution; if the collective farm had its own tractors and transport vehicles, it would not be necessary to use livestock to transport fertilizer.

    响应党的决议　促进农业高涨
    苏联青年争先恐后下乡做农民
    农村青年展开积肥比赛迎接春耕
    本报讯　苏联共产党中央委员会2月全会通过的关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的决议，激起了苏联广大农民的生产热忱。在全苏人民大讨论中，城乡青年都不甘落后，纷纷表示愿以实际行动响应中央的决议，为促进农业的进一步高涨出一把力。
    在古比雪夫州，工厂的青年们准备把厂里不需要的旧机器修理好送给农庄，青年建筑工人们打算组织工作队到农庄去帮助盖车库和修理所。这个州的团组织决定派五百名读过工艺学校的青年工人到农村去工作。青年们知道这个消息后都很兴奋，纷纷提出申请书，争取下乡去作农业劳动者。特别是很多在农村长大的青年工人更愿意回到农村，把技术献给故乡的建设。
    农村青年的干劲更大。例如，莫斯科州已展开了全州的青年积肥竞赛。青年们提出口号，要在4月15日，即团代表大会开幕日以前往田里送二百万吨肥料。“积极分子”农庄组织了青年积肥队，每个队员平均一天要运大粪二十吨。季米特洛夫区的青年农业劳动者为了作好春耕准备工作，特别组织了十五个畜力运肥队。在这件事情上，青年们也亲自体会到苏共中央决议的英明，如果农庄有自己的拖拉机和运输汽车的话就不必用牲口运肥了。
