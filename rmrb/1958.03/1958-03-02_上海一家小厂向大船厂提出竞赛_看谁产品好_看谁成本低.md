A Small Shanghai Factory Challenges a Large Shipyard
Let's See Whose Products are Better and Whose Costs are Lower

    (Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 1st Dispatch) In the surging wave of competition and appraisal, an interesting story was heard on the Huangpu River in Shanghai yesterday: A small factory with only eighty-three people—the China Mineral Industrial Raw Materials Factory, challenged Shanghai's largest and nationally renowned Jiangnan Shipyard, competing on "Who loves the factory like home the most?"
    The China Mineral Raw Materials Factory is a small factory that has achieved remarkable results by adhering to the principle of running the enterprise diligently and frugally. All the factory's employees love the factory like home and are thrifty. However, the Jiangnan Shipyard, due to its pride and extravagance in holding itself as "large factory, long history, new equipment, and good technology," has long suffered from serious waste. Last year, the average profit turned over to the state by the Mineral Raw Materials Factory was 8,000 yuan per person, about twenty times more than the average profit turned over by each employee of the Jiangnan Shipyard last year. Yesterday evening at 6 p.m., representatives of the Mineral Raw Materials Factory went to the Jiangnan Shipyard with gongs and drums to deliver the challenge letter. The Jiangnan Factory was holding an employee representative meeting to mobilize for a major rectification and reform. All the factory's employees were listening to the broadcast of the meeting. Luo Huaxing, director of the China Mineral Industrial Raw Materials Factory, said at the meeting: "Although the number of people in our factory is not even as many as the cooks in the Jiangnan Factory; all the assets of our factory are not even worth the value of a machine in your factory. But we want to compete with you in enthusiasm, in running the enterprise diligently and frugally, and in the idea of everyone loving the factory like home." He also said: "Although the raw material we use is stone, and you use steel, we are both working for the construction of the motherland. We guarantee to you: we will cherish every stone as much as we cherish a steamed bun. Our factory's main machine has been in use for more than twenty years, but we will still protect this old machine as if it were our own life." Then, he announced the factory's competition targets. The factory originally planned to turn over 700,000 yuan in profit this year, now it is increased to 830,000 yuan, an average of 10,000 yuan per person, enough to earn back four and a half factories in one year.
    Xiong Tianxian, an old worker at the China Mineral Industrial Raw Materials Factory, also introduced examples of the factory's workers loving the factory like home. When he was repairing a machine, he slept next to the machine for five consecutive days and nights in order to shorten the downtime, shortening the repair time by five days.
    When they finished speaking, the entire Jiangnan Factory was boiling. The meeting hall was immediately filled with slogans such as "Learn from brother factories," "Everyone build the country diligently and frugally," and "Love the factory like home." In a few minutes, more than a hundred people requested to speak. The workers outside the meeting hall kept calling the presidium, expressing their desire to learn from the China Mineral Industrial Raw Materials Factory.
    Zheng Zhong, director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, solemnly accepted the friendly challenge on behalf of all the factory's employees at the meeting, and announced four counter-challenge conditions: 1. Shorten the shipbuilding cycle by 20%; 2. Shorten the dock repair cycle by 50%; 3. Save 1,000 tons of steel this year; 4. Increase the profit turned over by 50%. Zheng Zhong expressed that the entire factory is determined to learn from the brother factory's thinking of diligence, frugality, and loving the factory like home, and is determined to use a vigorous spirit to change the bureaucratic air, extravagance, lethargy, arrogance, and squeamishness, as well as the old-fashioned complacency, conservatism, and backward thinking, so that this century-old factory can have a revolutionary turnaround. Now, the Jiangnan Shipyard is launching another upsurge of major rectification and reform based on the opinions of 500,000 big-character posters.
    In the current production upsurge in Shanghai, the masses have created many forms of competition. The competition between the China Mineral Raw Materials Factory and the Jiangnan Shipyard is another new form created by the masses. The size and products of these two factories are vastly different, and competition seems difficult. However, the masses still found a common point where they can carry out competition, that is, to compete and evaluate each other on running the enterprise diligently and frugally. There are many small factories in Shanghai. Although their factories are small, they have a great advantage, that is, they pay great attention to diligence and frugality, and the product quality is good and the cost is low. On the contrary, there are many large factories in Shanghai. Although their factories are large, the waste is also large, and they are often not as good as small factories in terms of running the enterprise diligently and frugally. The competition between these two large and small factories, the China Mineral Raw Materials Factory and the Jiangnan Shipyard, has set off a new wave in the competition upsurge in Shanghai factories.

### 上海一家小厂向大船厂提出竞赛  看谁产品好  看谁成本低

    上海一家小厂向大船厂提出竞赛
    看谁产品好  看谁成本低
    本报上海1日电　在汹涌澎湃的竞赛、评比热潮中，上海黄浦江畔昨天传出了一个有趣的佳话：一家只有八十三人的小型工厂——中国矿产工业原料厂，向上海规模最大、闻名全国的江南造船厂发起挑战，竞赛“谁最爱厂如家？”
    中国矿产原料厂是一家坚持勤俭办企业方针获得了显著成就的小工厂，全厂职工爱厂如家，克勤克俭，而江南造船厂由于存在着自持“工厂大，历史久，设备新，技术好”的骄气与阔气，长期以来浪费严重，去年一年，矿产原料厂平均每人向国家上缴的利润达八千元，比江南厂每个职工去年平均上缴利润多二十倍左右，矿产原料厂职工代表在昨天傍晚六时敲锣打鼓到江南造船厂送挑战书，江南厂正在举行动员大整大改的职工代表大会，全厂职工在收听大会的广播。中国矿产工业原料厂厂长罗华兴在大会上说：“我们厂的人数虽然还没有江南厂的炊事员多；我们厂的全部资产，还及不上你们厂里一部机器的价值。但是我们要和你们比干劲，比勤俭办企业，比人人爱厂如家的思想。”他又说：“虽然我们用的原料是石头，你们用的是钢材，但我们同是为祖国的建设。我们向你们保证：我们要像爱护一只馒头一样地来爱护每一块石头。我们厂的主要机器已经用了二十多年了，但是我们仍将像保护自己的生命一样保护这部老机器。”接着，他宣读了全厂的竞赛指标，这家厂原定今年上缴利润七十万元，现在增加为八十三万元，平均每人一万元，一年要换回四个半厂。
    中国矿产工业原料厂老工人熊天仙也介绍了这个厂工人爱厂如家的事例。他自己在检修机器时，为了要缩短停车时间，睡在机器旁边连续五天五夜，使检修的时间缩短了五天。
    他们讲话结束时，江南全厂都沸腾了。会场里顿时响彻了“向兄弟厂学习”、“人人勤俭建国”、“爱厂如家”等口号声，几分钟里就有一百多人要求发言。会场外的工人们，不断打电话给主席团，表示要向中国矿产工业原料厂学习。
  江南造船厂厂长郑重在会上代表全厂职工接受友谊挑战，并宣布了四项应战条件：一、造船周期缩短20％；二、船坞修船周期缩短50％；三、今年节约钢铁一千吨；四、增加上缴利润50％。郑重表示，全厂决心学习兄弟厂克勤克俭爱厂如家的思想，决心以生龙活虎的精神改掉官气、阔气、暮气、骄气、娇气，和老大自满、保守落后的思想，使这家百年老厂来一个革命的大翻身。现在江南造船厂正根据五十万张大字报的意见，再一次掀起一个大整大改的高潮。
    上海在当前的生产高潮中，群众已创造出了许多种竞赛的形式。中国矿产原料厂和江南造船厂的竞赛，是群众创造的又一种新形式。这两个厂大小悬殊，产品各异，竞赛似乎有困难。但群众还是找到了一个可以开展竞赛的共同点，即相互竞赛、评比勤俭办企业。上海有许多小型工厂，他们工厂虽小，却有个大的优点，即他们非常注意勤俭，产品质量好，成本低。相反，上海有不少大型工厂，他们工厂虽大，但浪费也大，在勤俭办企业方面往往不如小厂。中国矿产原料厂和江南造船厂这二个大、小工厂的竞赛，给上海工厂的竞赛高潮又卷起了一个新的浪花。
