France's Miscalculation
Yuan Xianlu

Paris officials have repeatedly sworn that resolving the North African issue is solely France's "responsibility." Gaillard also declared vehemently in the National Assembly on March 7th against "internationalizing" the Algerian issue. However, in the same speech, he proposed establishing a "North-South common defense axis" among "West Mediterranean countries" as a "necessary and inevitable supplement to the Atlantic Pact." This means that North Africa will henceforth be placed under the control of the North Atlantic group.

This self-contradictory attitude in the French Prime Minister's speech reflects the dilemma faced by the French government in North Africa.

For a long time, France has regarded North Africa as its exclusive preserve, striving to prevent its "partners" from interfering. However, the situation has recently deteriorated. In Algeria, the National Liberation Army has launched a powerful offensive; French colonial troops are being beaten everywhere and are exhausted. In Tunisia, the Sakiet bombing incident has sparked a wave of protests, and it seems difficult for French troops to remain in Tunisia. In Morocco, anti-French sentiment is also growing due to France's collusion with Spain to carry out armed suppression of rebels in the Moroccan Sahara region. Obviously, the French government has felt that it cannot single-handedly salvage its crumbling colonial rule, so it has had to seek help from its North Atlantic "partners." The plan to establish a "North-South common defense axis" for West Mediterranean countries was proposed in this context.

Of course, France is unwilling to give up North Africa. It has a wishful thinking: to rely on the North Atlantic group to suppress the North African national independence movement, while maintaining France's "unique position" in North Africa.

This wishful thinking is bound to fail. Washington has long been interested in North Africa. In the past, France used the argument that North Africa did not belong to the "defense area" of the North Atlantic group to resist American infiltration. Now, Gaillard is voluntarily disarming himself and wants to "connect" North Africa with the Atlantic group, which is exactly what the United States wants. Although the United States is not a member of this proposed military organization, this will not stop Washington's march into North Africa. Because, among the countries that will participate in this military group, Spain, despite having some common interests with France in North Africa at present, is after all obedient to Washington; the situation in Italy is the same, and it cannot get rid of its dependence on the United States. The United States has every means to control this military group through these two countries, making it another Baghdad Pact organization. In addition, Britain is not without interest in North Africa. It has colonies in the Mediterranean, and France cannot prevent it from entering this organization. The joint policy of the United States and Britain undermining France in North Africa has already been tested in Tunisia, and will naturally continue to be implemented in the future.

As for France's attempt to use the establishment of a Franco-Maghreb Federation as a shield to protect its colonial interests, this is also like climbing a tree to catch fish. Because, since France is unwilling to change its policy in North Africa, the so-called "federation" is nothing more than a disguise for colonial rule; moreover, since this "federation" will participate in the "North-South common defense axis" of West Mediterranean countries, North Africa will be tied to the chariot of the North Atlantic group. The people of North Africa, who have been engaged in a long and heroic struggle for national independence, will never agree to let France push them into even deeper disasters. On the contrary, they will further strengthen the struggle against colonialism, so that the destiny of their motherland can be grasped in their own hands as soon as possible.

In short, France's practice of planning to establish a military group in the West Mediterranean not only will not help improve its situation in North Africa, but will also make it lose the last opportunity to improve relations with the people of North Africa. Rein in at the edge of the precipice, turn back to the shore; otherwise, France will reap the evil consequences it has sown with its own hands.

    法国的算盘打错了
    袁先禄
    巴黎的官员们一再赌咒发誓地说，解决北非问题只能是法国的“责任”。盖伊阿3月7日在国民议会里也慷慨激昂地表示反对使阿尔及利亚问题“国际化”。然而，就在同一次发言里，他却提出要在“西地中海沿岸国家”中筹建一个“南北共同防御轴心”，作为“大西洋公约的必要和必然的补充”。这就是说，北非今后将置于北大西洋集团的控制下。
    法国总理发言中的这种自相矛盾的态度，反映了法国政府在北非的进退两难的处境。
    长期以来，法国一直把北非看作禁脔，竭力不让它的“伙伴”染指。可是，近来的情况越来越不妙。在阿尔及利亚，民族解放军发动了强大的攻势；法国殖民军队处处挨打，疲于奔命。在突尼斯的萨基埃特轰炸事件引起了抗议的怒潮，法国的军队看来很难再在突尼斯呆下去。在摩洛哥，由于法国同西班牙勾结，对摩洛哥撒哈拉地区的起义者进行武装镇压，反法的情绪也正在增长。显然，法国政府已经感到不能独力挽救它的殖民统治于既倒，于是只好向北大西洋的“伙伴”求助。筹建西地中海国家“南北共同防御轴心”的计划，就是这样提出来的。
    当然，法国决不甘心放弃北非。它有着一厢情愿的打算：既能依靠北大西洋集团来镇压北非的民族独立运动，又能使法国保持在北非的“独特的地位”。
    这种如意算盘是肯定要落空的。华盛顿有志于北非久矣。过去，法国曾经以北非不属于北大西洋集团的“防御地区”为理由，来抗拒美国的渗入。现在，盖伊阿主动解除了自己的武装，要把北非和大西洋集团“联接”起来，这对美国说来是恰中下怀。虽然，美国并不是这个拟议中的军事组织的成员国，但是这一点不能阻挡华盛顿向北非的进军。因为，在将要参加这个军事集团的国家中，西班牙尽管目前同法国在北非有着一些共同的利益，然而毕竟在华盛顿面前是唯命是从的；意大利的情况也一样，目前还不能摆脱对美国的依靠。美国完全有办法通过这两个国家控制这个军事集团，使它成为又一个巴格达条约组织。此外，英国对北非也不是没有兴趣。它在地中海有着殖民地，法国不能不让它进入这个组织。美英两国在北非挖法国墙脚的联合政策已经在突尼斯牛刀初试，今后自然还会继续执行下去。
    至于法国企图用建立法兰西—马格里布联邦作为保护自己殖民利益的屏障，这也是缘木求鱼。因为，既然法国不愿意改变在北非的政策，那末所谓“联邦”不过是殖民统治的伪装而已；何况，由于这个“联邦”将参加西地中海国家“南北共同防御轴心”，北非就要被绑上北大西洋集团的战车。为了民族独立而进行着长期英勇斗争的北非人民，决不会同意让法国把他们推进更加深重的灾难中去。恰恰相反，他们将进一步加强反对殖民主义的斗争，使祖国的命运早日掌握在自己的手中。
    总之，法国在西地中海策划建立军事集团的做法，不但无助于改善它在北非的处境，而且将使它失去同北非人民改善关系的最后机会。悬崖勒马，回头是岸，否则，法国将会得它亲手种下的恶果。
