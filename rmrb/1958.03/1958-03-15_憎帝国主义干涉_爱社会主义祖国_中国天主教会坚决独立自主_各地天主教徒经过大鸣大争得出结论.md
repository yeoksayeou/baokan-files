Xinhua News Agency, dated 14th: Twenty-six provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country have recently convened Catholic representatives' conferences, study sessions, or forums to conduct socialist learning and relay the resolutions of the Chinese Catholic Representatives' Conference held in July last year.

The meetings in various regions have adopted the methods of "extensive airing of views, big-character posters, and extensive debates," emphasizing facts and reasoning to fully promote democracy. In their speeches at the meetings, they expressed their firm support for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, adherence to the socialist path, and resolute independence and self-reliance in running the church. Archbishop Pi Shushi of the Shenyang Archdiocese, Bishop Duan Yinming of Wanxian, Sichuan Province, Bishop Li Boyu of Zhouzhi Diocese, Shaanxi Province, and Acting Bishop Yang Gaojian of Changde Diocese, Hunan Province, all pointed out at the meetings in various regions that Catholics must promote national self-esteem, completely get rid of imperialist control, resolutely oppose interference from the Vatican, and rely on the strength of Chinese Catholic friends to independently and autonomously run the Chinese Catholic Church.

At the meetings held in various regions, a small number of right-wing elements hiding within the Catholic Church launched many vicious attacks against the Communist Party and socialism. Fan Xueyan, Bishop of the Baoding Diocese in Hebei Province, frantically clamored that expelling imperialist elements was "sinful" and slandered the People's Government as "double-dealing" and the worker-peasant alliance as a "collusive relationship." Chang Zhenguo, Acting Bishop of the Siping Diocese in Jilin Province, openly advocated "absolutely no cooperation with the People's Government" and even incited believers to "fight" against the People's Government with the reactionary slogan "kneel down and pray, rise up and fight." These right-wing elements also defended the reactionary political face of the Vatican in a servile manner.

Participants in the meetings were extremely indignant at the rampant attacks by right-wing elements. They cited facts to forcefully refute the reactionary words and deeds of the right-wing elements and widely exposed the reactionary crimes of the Vatican. They pointed out that the Vatican not only consistently opposed the Chinese people before liberation, using Catholicism to serve the colonialism of American imperialism, but also continuously undermined the anti-imperialist and patriotic movement of Chinese Catholics in the years since liberation, sowing discord between Chinese Catholics and the unity of the people across the country, and interfering in our internal affairs. Even now, many dioceses of the Chinese Catholic Church are still occupied by imperialist elements who have been expelled from China but still hold the title of bishop. Patriotic Catholics absolutely cannot tolerate these crimes of the Vatican.

    憎帝国主义干涉　爱社会主义祖国
    中国天主教会坚决独立自主
    各地天主教徒经过大鸣大争得出结论
    据新华社1 4日讯　全国已有二十六个省、市、自治区在最近先后召开了天主教徒代表会、学习会或座谈会，进行社会主义学习和传达去年7月间召开的中国天主教代表会议的决议。
    各地会议都是采取大鸣大放、大字报、大争大辩的方式，摆事实讲道理，充分发扬了民主。他们在会上的发言中都表示坚决拥护中国共产党的领导，走社会主义道路，坚决独立自主自办教会。沈阳总主教区总主教皮漱石、四川省万县主教段荫明、陕西省盩厔教区主教李伯渔、湖南省常德教区代主教杨高坚等都在各地的会议上指出：天主教徒必须发扬民族自尊心，彻底摆脱帝国主义的控制，坚决反对梵蒂冈的干涉，依靠中国天主教友的力量，独立自主地办好中国天主教会。
    在各地举行的会议上，少数隐藏在天主教内的右派分子向共产党、向社会主义作了许多恶毒的进攻。河北省保定教区主教范学淹疯狂地叫嚣驱逐帝国主义分子“有罪”，并污蔑人民政府“口是心非”、工农联盟是“狼狈关系”；吉林省四平教区代主教常镇国公然主张“决不能与人民政府合作”，并且还以“跪下祈祷，起来战斗”的反动口号，煽动教徒同人民政府进行“战斗”。这些右派分子还奴颜婢膝地为梵蒂冈的反动政治面目辩护。
    参加会议的人对右派分子的猖狂进攻极为愤慨。他们列举事实，对右派分子的反动言行进行了有力的驳斥，并且广泛地揭发了梵蒂冈的反动罪行。他们指出，梵蒂冈不但在解放前一贯敌视中国人民，利用天主教为美帝国主义的殖民主义服务。解放几年来，梵蒂冈还不断地破坏中国天主教徒的反帝爱国运动，挑拨中国天主教徒与全国人民的团结，干涉我国内政，直到现在，中国天主教的许多教区仍由已被中国人民驱逐出境的帝国主义分子霸占着主教的名义。爱国天主教徒绝对不能容忍梵蒂冈的这些罪行。
