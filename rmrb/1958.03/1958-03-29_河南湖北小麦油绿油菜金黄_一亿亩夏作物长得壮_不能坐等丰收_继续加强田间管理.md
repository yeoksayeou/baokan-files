Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 28th - In Henan Province, over 70 million mu of wheat are growing with deep roots, lush leaves, thick stalks, and many tillers. The wheat seedlings are thriving as never before in decades. Currently, various localities are watering, fertilizing, and cultivating the fields, striving to improve the first-class wheat, transform the second-class wheat, and eliminate the third-class wheat, in order to win a great harvest this wheat season and fire the first shot in the great leap forward in production.

According to inspections in various parts of Henan, because the wheat is growing well, some areas have developed a "wait for a bumper harvest" mentality, relaxing field management. In response to this situation, Party committees in various localities have immediately strengthened their leadership over wheat field management. The Yu East region has already proposed a method of secretaries taking command, with levels assigning dedicated personnel to be responsible for specific areas, contracting tasks, and guaranteeing yields. In the Xinxiang area, the prefectural Party secretary and county Party secretaries are leading visits to key wheat fields, evaluating each plot, and making assessments. In addition to drawing out a portion of commune members to continue strengthening the management of first-class wheat seedlings, preparing them as high-yield fields, some areas have also established specialized wheat management cultivation teams, universally inserting signs on the heads of the third-class wheat seedling plots, determining yields, and implementing a system of specialized responsibility to guarantee yields to the end.

Various localities are making full use of newly developed water conservancy facilities to divert water to irrigate wheat fields. In areas with better irrigation conditions, they are also required to apply "three fertilizers and five waterings," and to shape the ridges while watering. Although there has been rain in the Nanyang and Luoyang areas, the soil moisture is not thorough, and these areas are taking various measures to irrigate. To solve the difficulty of insufficient water lifting tools, agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives in various localities are improving and rushing to produce various water lifting tools. The topdressing fertilizer applied to the wheat fields this year is also doubled compared to the same period last year. 95% of the wheat fields have now been topdressed for the first time, and nearly half have been topdressed two to three times. In the vast majority of areas, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu exceeds 10,000 jin. Weeding activities are also intense, with most areas having weeded two or three times. In places where the wheat seedlings are too dense to weed with hoes, commune members are pulling weeds by hand, ensuring no weeds, no insects, and no diseased plants.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 28th - Summer harvest crops are growing well on over 30 million mu in Hubei Province. The wheat and barley are growing vigorously and are emerald green. The rapeseed is already golden yellow. This is the result of strengthening field management of summer harvest crops in various localities over the past half-month.

Before the vernal equinox, various localities generally carried out one to two topdressings and weedings for summer harvest crops, and particularly focused on cultivating the poorly growing third-class seedlings. In the Xiangyang area, which accounts for half of the province's summer harvest grain crop output, wheat fields have generally been topdressed twice, and some have been topdressed three or four times. Currently, the wheat seedlings are growing very well. In the Xiaogan area, from the first to the middle of March, 300,000 to 500,000 people participated in field management every day. Now, this area has reversed the poor growth situation of most of the third-class seedlings. The Huanggang area originally had 910,000 mu of third-class seedlings, and after half a month of hard work, 810,000 mu have caught up to first-class or second-class seedlings. Relevant departments in Hubei Province predict that, barring unexpected disasters, the province's summer grain harvest may increase by about 50% compared to last year, with the Xiangyang area expected to double its yield.

Because summer harvest crops are generally growing well, some commune members and cadres in some areas have developed complacency and apathy. In some areas, for some backward seedlings and backward fields, it is thought that there is no hope of winning a bumper harvest, so no fertilizer is applied and no ditches are dug, and they want to concentrate their efforts on autumn crops. There are also some commune members and cadres who want to plow and turn the poorly grown barley, rapeseed, and bean crops as green manure to solve the fertilizer problem for autumn crops. The agricultural production inspection team of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, which is currently inspecting the work below, believes that this thinking is wrong and will affect the total output of summer harvest crops. They have instructed and helped various localities to change this phenomenon.

### 河南湖北小麦油绿油菜金黄  一亿亩夏作物长得壮  不能坐等丰收　继续加强田间管理

    河南湖北小麦油绿油菜金黄
    一亿亩夏作物长得壮
    不能坐等丰收　继续加强田间管理
    新华社郑州28日电　河南省七千多万亩小麦长得根深、叶茂、杆粗、杈多，麦苗茁壮为几十年所未有。目前各地正在浇地、施肥和中耕管理，努力提高一类麦、改变二类麦、消灭三类麦，争取今年麦季大丰收，打响生产跃进的头一炮。
    根据河南各地的检查，因为麦子长得好，部分地方产生了“坐等丰收”的思想，放松了麦田管理。各地党委根据这一情况，立即加强对麦田管理的领导。豫东地区已经提出书记挂帅，层层确定专人负责，分片包任务包产量的办法。新乡地区由地委书记和县委书记带领，到麦田重点参观，逐块评比，逐块鉴定。有些地区除了抽出一部分社员继续加强一类麦苗的管理，准备作为丰产田以外，还特别建立了小麦管理专业耕作队，普遍在三类麦苗地头上插牌，确定产量，实行专门负责包产到底的办法。
    各地都在充分利用新开发的水利工程设施，引水浇灌麦田。灌溉条件比较好的地方，还要求做到三肥五水，并做到边浇水边整畦。南阳、洛阳等专区虽然下了雨，但墒情不透，这些地区正在采取各种办法进行灌溉。为解决提水工具不足的困难，各地农业社和手工业社正在改良和赶制各种提水工具。今年小麦地里施的追肥也比去年同期增加一倍。95％的麦田现在都已上过第一遍追肥，还有将近半数以上的麦田上过两遍到三遍追肥，绝大多数地区每亩施肥数量都超过万斤。锄麦活动也很紧张，大部地区已锄过两三遍。麦苗长得稠密无法下锄的地方，社员们就用手薅草，做到无草、无虫、无病株。
    新华社武汉28日电　湖北省三千多万亩夏收作物生长良好。大、小麦长的油绿茁壮，油菜已遍地金黄。这是近半个多月来各地加强夏收作物田间管理的结果。
    春分前，各地普遍对夏收作物进行了一次到两次追肥、锄草，特别抓紧了对生长不好的三类苗的培育。占全省夏收粮食作物产量一半的襄阳专区，麦田已普遍追肥两次，有的追肥三、四次。目前麦苗生长很好。孝感专区在3月上、中旬期间，每天有三十万到五十万人参加田间管理。现在，这一专区已经把大部分三类苗的生长不好的状况改变过来。黄冈专区原有九十一万亩三类苗，经过半月苦战，已经使八十一万亩赶上一类苗或二类苗。湖北省有关部门预计，如无意外灾害，全省夏收粮食可能比去年增产50％左右，其中襄阳专区可望增产一倍。
    由于夏收作物一般生长良好，有些地区的社员和干部产生自满和麻痹情绪。有的地区对于部分落后苗、落后田，认为争取丰收无望，肥也不追、沟也不开，想集中力量搞秋季作物；还有些社员和干部想把长得较差的大麦、油菜、豆类作物翻耕作绿肥，来解决秋收作物的肥料问题。正在下面检查工作的中共湖北省委农业生产检查团，认为这种思想是错误的，会影响夏收作物的总产量，他们已经指示并帮助各地改变这种现象。
