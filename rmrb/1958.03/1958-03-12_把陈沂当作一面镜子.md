Take Chen Yi as a Mirror
傅锺

Chen Yi has raised the heinous banner of anti-Party and anti-socialism and done all sorts of bad things; this is already known to people. Chen Yi has also served as a teacher by negative example. We can take him as a mirror, thereby drawing some important lessons.

Chen Yi was once a veteran Communist Party member with more than twenty years of Party membership, and a veteran cadre who had held many important positions. He was awarded the rank of Major General in the People's Liberation Army. Such a veteran Party member and veteran cadre degenerating into a bourgeois rightist is a serious lesson. Chen Yi, from his point of view, valued the "veteran" status of being a veteran Party member and veteran cadre quite highly. Naturally, our Party and the people also value veteran Party members and veteran cadres. The Party relies on them to lead the broad masses of people in completing and continuing to complete the great cause of revolution and construction. The vast majority of veteran Party members and veteran cadres are also conscientious and wholeheartedly serving the people. Some bourgeois rightists have adopted the tactic of "attacking one point, exaggerating it as much as possible, and ignoring the rest," maliciously attacking veteran Party members and veteran cadres; needless to say, that is with ulterior motives. However, Chen Yi's view of veteran Party members and veteran cadres actually has a fundamental difference from ours. In Chen Yi's view, since he is a veteran Party member and veteran cadre, even if he has some "minor problems," it is not a big deal, and there is absolutely no need to worry about it. Ideological remolding, criticism, and self-criticism can all be put aside. Chen Yi came from a feudal landlord and bureaucratic family, and from childhood he developed an extremely serious exploitative class consciousness. After joining the revolution, although the Party carried out long-term education for him, he was always unwilling to abandon his original class stand. During his tenure as the Minister of Culture of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, his bourgeois individualism developed even more malignantly, with no regard for discipline, no regard for leadership, being autocratic, bullying those below him and deceiving those above him, treating the Ministry of Culture he led as an independent kingdom, as a tool for him to gain fame and profit. In Chen Yi's view, these were all just "minor problems" and were insignificant for him as a veteran Party member and veteran cadre. Therefore, the leaders of the General Political Department repeatedly criticized him severely, but he always adopted a resistant attitude of outwardly complying but inwardly opposing. Now, it is very clear that Chen Yi, relying on his seniority as a veteran Party member and veteran cadre, fell into the quagmire of bourgeois rightists once the political climate changed.

In recent years, the boiling and vibrant political life has made more and more people understand a truth: our Party does not exist in isolation from society. The class struggle in society is bound to be reflected in the Party, and bourgeois ideology is bound to be reflected in the Party. The fact that Chen Yi degenerated from a veteran Party member and veteran cadre into a bourgeois rightist tells us that every Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre, even veteran Party members and veteran cadres, must constantly remold their thinking, constantly heighten their political vigilance, and prevent the invasion of bourgeois ideology. Bourgeois ideology is like radioactive dust. People will be contaminated and poisoned if they are slightly negligent. The invasion of bourgeois ideology against revolutionaries does not discriminate between old and new, but is "equal opportunity." Those with a firm stand and strong will resist it and gradually increase their immunity in the process of continuous resistance. Those with an unstable stand and weak will, some could not resist it at certain times, but after the Party's education and the help of the masses, they later became stronger and resisted it; a few refused to accept the education and help of the Party and the masses, completely disarmed themselves, and became prisoners of bourgeois ideology. Chen Yi was not remolded at all and naturally belongs to another situation. The vast majority of our veteran Party members and veteran cadres are fundamentally different from Chen Yi, but we should also remember what Chairman Mao taught us: faces should be washed every day, and the ground should be swept every day. This is what is meant by preventing problems before they arise. A thousand-mile-long dike often collapses due to a small seepage hole. If small ideological problems are not overcome in time and are allowed to develop, they will become big problems; moreover, some that are considered small problems may originally be big problems. If one relies on seniority as a veteran Party member and veteran cadre, lying down on the "veteran" status, thinking that having this "veteran" status means that one is destined not to be invaded by bourgeois ideology, that one can ignore ideological remolding and relax political vigilance, the result will inevitably be that the dust of bourgeois ideology accumulates more and more, and one will eventually be buried inside. Time is only the form of material movement, and it itself has no decisive significance. People's thoughts are derivatives of matter. In a certain period of time, they either move forward or backward, like sailing against the current: if you don't advance, you retreat. Relying solely on the "veteran" status, solely on the factor of time, and no longer conscientiously continuing to advance will inevitably lead to ruining oneself. No matter how long a person's Party membership is or how high their position is, if they do not earnestly strengthen ideological remolding, they will eventually fall; if they don't fall today, they will fall tomorrow; if they don't fall on this issue, they will fall on that issue. From this, it can be seen that even veteran Party members and veteran cadres must always be vigilant against the invasion of bourgeois ideology and continue to strengthen ideological remolding.

Bourgeois ideology is not empty; it has its specific content. As the core of bourgeois ideology, individualism. It was precisely because of the malignant development of bourgeois individualism that Chen Yi degenerated into a rightist within the Party.

Chen Yi put "I" at the center of everything, exaggerating personal role, emphasizing personal prestige, and expanding "I" to the extent of covering the sky and the earth. Everything is for "I". If it is beneficial to "I", I will do it, even things like using pseudonyms to write articles attacking others, promoting oneself, and attacking leaders, regardless of personal integrity. If it is not beneficial to "I", I will not do it, even resisting decisions such as the Party Central Military Commission's decision to merge the General Political Department's Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Culture. Not only resisting but also undermining it. Chen Yi had personal ambitions. His bourgeois individualism had gone beyond the scope of general ideological problems and made him a political bourgeois individualist ambitious. People with bourgeois individualist thoughts, the higher their personal prestige, the lower the Party's prestige in their minds. Initially, they only had individualism in a local part of their minds; later, this locally existing individualism gradually expanded like a malignant virus until it filled the entire mind. Initially, they were only dissatisfied with and hostile to certain local organizations of the Party, certain individual leaders of the Party; later, they became dissatisfied with and hostile to the entire Party. Initially, their erroneous views were fragmentary and dispersed, sometimes manifested on this issue, sometimes manifested on that issue; later, their erroneous views formed a system, and they would be manifested on any issue. This is the process of the development of bourgeois individualism from quantitative change to qualitative change, from a general ideological problem to a political bourgeois individualist ambitious. It is necessary to recognize this law; with such recognition, we can more deeply appreciate how important it is to wash our faces every day, sweep the floor every day, and prevent problems before they arise.

Chen Yi not only used bourgeois individualism to "discipline himself" but also used it everywhere to influence others. His theory is: "Everyone has individualism," "There is nothing great about having a little individualism." "Everyone has individualism"? No. This is judging the hearts of revolutionaries with the heart of a rightist. Hundreds of millions of outstanding Communist Party members and revolutionary martyrs, worry about the world's worries before the world worries, enjoy the world's joys after the world enjoys, sacrifice themselves to achieve benevolence, abandon their lives to take righteousness, wear out their heels to benefit the people, is this individualism? From great leaders to ordinary soldiers, their countless heroic deeds of selflessness are being praised everywhere, is this individualism? Despite Chen Yi's surface efforts of "promoting new heroic figures" and "depicting major themes," it was only a surface effort. Chen Yi would never understand the spirit, demeanor, morality, and civilization of communism. Individualism is a product of private ownership, and it is fundamentally incompatible with socialism's public ownership and collectivism. Some people (not all, just some) have not transformed their thinking enough, and individualism still exists to varying degrees. That is by no means legitimate and by no means "nothing great." "Nothing great"? Chen Yi has already answered himself with his own ending.

Unity is the life of the Party. Sabotaging the Party's unity is a prominent manifestation of Chen Yi's various anti-Party crimes. He first sabotaged the Party's unity within the army. He deceived, muddled through, slandered, and resisted his superiors; he deceived, oppressed, wooed, and indulged his subordinates; he was domineering, arbitrary, despised, and slandered his colleagues. In short, he blew and praised everywhere, attacked and pulled, had one set in public and another in private, outwardly complied but inwardly opposed, was two-faced, said A to B, said C to D, sowed discord, and created discord. All the words used to express the bad qualities of the exploiting class can be used on Chen Yi.

Chen Yi's destructive activities were able to develop and continue, which has a lesson for us. Before the anti-rightist struggle, very serious liberalism grew in the former Cultural Department of the General Political Department. Some people held the attitude of "knowing it's wrong, it's better to say less," abandoned ideological struggle, and advocated peace without principles. Some people emphasized "friendship," valued friendship over organization, and developed a vulgar style of being detached from politics and principles. Some people were afraid of retaliation and dared not struggle, showing the petty-bourgeoisie's weakness and vacillation in the face of major issues of right and wrong. Liberalism is often combined with individualism. Some people, because they were worried about personal gains and losses, were afraid of not getting what they wanted personally, afraid of losing what they did not want to lose personally, and dared not fight against Chen Yi. In this way, favorable climate and soil were created for Chen Yi's conspiracy to undermine the Party's unity. Liberalism is a manifestation of opportunism and is a corrosive agent of the revolutionary ranks. As long as there is liberalism, it will weaken or even lose the sensitivity to maintain the Party's unity and damage the Party's body. We must thoroughly overcome liberalism.

It should also be said here that Chen Yi's activities to undermine the Party's unity were not only manifested within the army but also extended to outside the army. Within the army, he used "artistic characteristics" to resist leadership, while outside the army, he used "army characteristics" to confront the Party and the state. This is clearly a direct violation of the principle that our army is under the absolute leadership of the Party and is a tool of the Party and the state. At any time and in any place, if this principle is violated, serious mistakes will be made. We must learn a lesson from Chen Yi. We must pay close attention to strengthening the unity between the army and the local areas, between the army and the people, so that this unity reaches an even closer level.

Chen Yi's anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy has been shattered, which is a major victory for us. Chen Yi is a bad person. It is also a bad thing that such a bad person appeared in our ranks. However, we defeated him and made our Party and army's body healthier, so the bad thing turned into a good thing. As long as we are good at learning lessons, turning negative factors into positive factors, we will definitely be able to do our work better, and we will definitely be able to better promote our cause of revolution and construction.

    把陈沂当作一面镜子
    傅锺
    陈沂打起了反党反社会主义的罪恶旗帜，做了种种坏事，这是人们已经知道了的。陈沂也当了反面教员。我们可以把他当作一面镜子，从而吸取一些重要的教训。
    陈沂曾经是一个有二十多年党龄的老共产党员，是一个担负过许多重要职务的老干部，他在人民解放军中曾经被授予少将军衔。以这样的一个老党员老干部而堕落成为资产阶级右派分子，这就是一个严重的教训。陈沂对于他是老党员老干部的这个“老”字，是从他的观点出发而颇为看重的。自然，我们的党和人民，也很看重老党员老干部，党依靠着他们，带动广大人民群众，完成了并正在继续完成伟大的革命和建设事业；绝大多数老党员老干部，也都是兢兢业业，全心全意为人民服务的。有些资产阶级右派分子，采取了“攻其一点，尽量夸大，不及其余”的手法，恶意地攻击老党员老干部，不消说，那是别有用心的。但是，陈沂对于老党员老干部的看法，在实际上与我们也存在着根本的分歧。在陈沂看来，他既然是一个老党员老干部，即使有点“小毛病”，也无关大体，决然用不着管它，什么思想改造，什么批评与自我批评，可以一概置之脑后。陈沂出身于封建地主官僚家庭，自幼就养成了极端严重的剥削阶级意识。参加革命以后，党虽然对他进行了长期的教育，但他总是不愿放弃原来的阶级立场。在他任解放军总政治部文化部长期间，他的资产阶级个人主义更有了恶性的发展，目无纪律，目无领导，唯我独尊，欺上压下，把他所领导的文化部当成一个独立王国，当成他争名夺利的工具。在陈沂看来，这些都不过是“小毛病”，对于他这个老党员老干部来说，是无关紧要的。因此，总政治部的领导上屡次对他进行严厉的批评，他都一概采取阳奉阴违的抗拒态度。现在，事情已经很清楚了，以老党员老干部骄矜自恃的陈沂，当政治气候一旦起了变化，就滚到资产阶级右派的泥坑里去了。
    近年来沸腾而生动的政治生活，已经使越来越多的人懂得了一条真理：我们的党不是脱离社会而孤立存在的，社会上的阶级斗争必然反映到党内来，资产阶级思想必然反映到党内来。陈沂由一个老党员老干部堕落成为资产阶级右派分子的事实告诉我们，任何一个共产党员和革命干部，即使是老党员老干部，也必须不断地改造自己的思想，时刻提高政治警惕，防止资产阶级思想的侵袭。资产阶级思想好像一种放射性尘埃，人们稍有疏忽，就会受到它的沾染而中毒。资产阶级思想对于革命者的侵袭，是不问新老，而“一视同仁”的。立场坚定、意志坚强的人，抵抗住了，并从不断的抵抗当中，逐渐增强着自己的免疫力。立场不稳、意志薄弱的人，有的在某些时候抵抗不住，经过党的教育和群众的帮助，后来也变得比较坚强起来，抵抗住了；个别的则拒不接受党和群众的教育和帮助，完全解除了武装，变成了资产阶级思想的俘虏。陈沂根本没有得到改造，自然是属于另外一种情况。我们绝大多数老党员老干部，与陈沂是根本不同的，但是我们也应该记住毛主席所教导我们的：脸要天天洗，地要天天扫。所谓防微杜渐，就是这个意思。千里长堤，往往是由于一个小小的渗洞而溃决的。思想上的小毛病如果不及时加以克服，任其发展，就会变成大毛病；何况，有些自认为是小毛病的，也许本来就是大毛病。如果以老党员老干部骄矜自恃，躺倒在“老”字上边，以为有了这个“老”字，就命定地不会受到资产阶级思想的侵袭，就可以忽视思想改造，放松政治警惕，结果势必会由于沾染的资产阶级思想的尘埃越积越多，终于被掩埋在里边。时间，只不过是物质运动的形式，它的本身，是没有决定意义的。人们的思想，是物质的派生物，在一定的时间里，它或者是向前运动，或者是向后运动，犹如逆水行舟，不进则退。单单依靠一个“老”字，单单依靠时间的因素，就不再兢兢业业地继续前进，其结果必将是毁了自己。一个人不论他的党龄有多么长，职位有多么高，如果不切实地加强思想改造，终于也会摔跤的；今天不摔跤，明天也要摔跤；在这个问题上不摔跤，在那个问题上也要摔跤。由此可见，即使是老党员老干部，也必须时刻警惕资产阶级思想的侵袭，继续加强思想改造。
    资产阶级思想，不是空洞的，它有其具体的内容。作为资产阶级思想的核心的，是个人主义。陈沂正是由于资产阶级个人主义的恶性发展，堕落成为党内右派分子的。
    陈沂处处以“我”为中心，夸大个人作用，强调个人威信，把“我”扩张到遮天盖地的程度。一切为了“我”。对“我”有利的，我干，甚至像化名写打击别人、抬高自己、攻击领导的文章那样人格堕落的事，都干。对“我”不利的，不干，甚至像党中央军委关于总政宣传部和文化部合并这样的决定，也要加以抗拒，不仅抗拒，还要拆台。陈沂是有个人野心的，他的资产阶级个人主义，已经越出了一般思想问题的范围，而使他成为政治上的资产阶级个人主义野心家了。有资产阶级个人主义思想的人，他们个人的声望越高，党在它们心目中的威信就越低。开始时，他们头脑中还只是局部地存在着个人主义；到后来，这个局部存在的个人主义，就像恶性病毒一样逐渐扩大，以至最后充斥了整个的头脑。开始时，他们还只是不满和仇视党的某些局部组织，党的某些个别领导人；到后来，他们就不满和仇视整个的党了。开始时，他们的错误观点还带有零碎、分散的性质，有时在这个问题上表现出来，有时在那个问题上表现出来；到后来，他们的错误观点就形成了一个体系，不论在什么问题上，都要表现出来了。这就是资产阶级个人主义从量变到质变的发展过程，从一般的思想问题发展到政治上的资产阶级个人主义野心家的过程。认识到这一规律，是很必要的；有了这样的认识，就可以更加深切地体会到天天洗脸、天天扫地、防微杜渐是多么要紧了。
    陈沂不仅以资产阶级个人主义“律己”，还到处用它来影响别人。他的理论是：“个人主义人人都有”，“有点个人主义没有什么了不起”。“个人主义人人都有”吗？否。这是以右派之心，度革命者之腹。成千成万优秀的共产党员和革命志士，先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐，杀身成仁，舍生取义，摩顶放踵，而利人民，这是个人主义吗？从伟大的领袖到普通的士兵，他们的多少可歌可泣的舍己为人的英雄事迹到处被人传诵，这是个人主义吗？尽管陈沂打着“宣扬新英雄人物”“描写重大题材”的旗号，大做表面文章，但那毕竟是表面文章而已，共产主义的精神、风貌、道德和文明，陈沂是根本不会理解的。个人主义是私有制的产物，它与社会主义的公有制和集体主义，是根本不相容的。有些人（不是全部的人，只是一些人），对于自己的思想还改造得不够，还程度不等地存在着个人主义，那也决不是合法的，决不是“没有什么了不起的”。“没有什么了不起”吗？陈沂已经以自己的结局给自己作出回答了。
    团结是党的生命。破坏党的团结，是陈沂种种反党罪行中的一条突出的表现。他首先在军队内部破坏党的团结。他对上级是欺骗，蒙混，诋毁，抗拒；对下级是蒙蔽，欺压，拉拢，纵容；对同级是跋扈，专横，卑视，诽谤。总之，他到处吹吹捧捧，打打拉拉，表面一套，背后一套，阳奉阴违，两面三刀，逢甲说乙，逢丙说丁，挑拨离间，制造不和。人们用来表述剥削阶级恶劣品质的种种语汇，都可以用在陈沂身上。
    陈沂的这些破坏活动之所以得以发展和延续，对我们是有教训的。在反右派斗争以前，总政前文化部滋长着十分严重的自由主义。有些人抱着“明知不对，少说为佳”的态度，放弃了思想斗争，主张无原则的和平。有些人讲“朋友义气”，友情重于组织，发展了脱离政治、脱离原则的庸俗作风。有些人害怕报复打击，不敢斗争，在大是大非面前表现了小资产阶级的软弱性和动摇性。自由主义往往又与个人主义结合在一起。有些人因为存在着个人得失之患，从个人利益出发，怕得不到个人所要得到的东西，怕失去了个人所不愿失去的东西，也不敢与陈沂作斗争。这样，就给陈沂的破坏党的团结的阴谋活动造成了有利的气候和土壤。自由主义是机会主义的一种表现，是革命队伍的腐蚀剂。只要一有自由主义，就会削弱甚至丧失对于维护党的团结的敏感，就会使党的肌体受到损害。我们一定要彻底克服自由主义。
    这里还要说到，陈沂破坏党的团结的活动，不仅表现在军队内部，还扩展到了军队外部。他在军队内部，以“文艺特点”来抗拒领导，而在军队外部，则以“军队特点”来与党和国家分庭抗礼。这显然是直接违背了我军是在党的绝对领导之下，是党和国家的工具这个原则。不论在什么时候，不论在什么地方，如果违背了这个原则，就会犯严重的错误。我们一定要从陈沂身上吸取教训。我们一定要十分关注地加强军队和地方、军队和人民的团结，使这种团结达到更加亲密无间的程度。
    陈沂的反党反社会主义阴谋，被击碎了，这是我们的一个重大胜利。陈沂是个坏人。我们队伍中出了他这么个坏人，也是一件坏事。但是，我们战胜了他，使我们的党和军队的肌体更加健康起来，于是，坏事就变成了好事。只要我们善于接受教训，化消极因素为积极因素，我们就一定能把我们的工作做得更好，就一定能把我们的革命和建设事业更好地推向前进。
