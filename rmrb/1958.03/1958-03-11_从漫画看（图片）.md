    Seen Through Cartoons
    The Burden is Increased
    West German Economics Minister Erhard tells workers and capitalists: "Each of us must bear a heavier burden." (Originally published in the West German "Another Newspaper")
    One Against a Hundred
    In Western countries, capitalists use workers as machines, disregard their well-being, and try every means to increase labor intensity in order to extract more profit.
                        (Originally published in the American "National Vanguard")
    Enemy Within
    The American ruling group uses the pretext of threats to American security to frantically expand armaments. In reality, no one wants to invade or threaten the United States. On the contrary, the United States has many domestic crises and worries. For example, the increasingly serious juvenile delinquency among young people has caused concern among some bourgeois figures. The New York Herald Tribune published this cartoon under the title "Enemy Within."
    Portraits of Bonn Officialdom
    In re-militarized West Germany, politics are increasingly corrupt, and economic difficulties are constantly growing. Adenauer, who calls himself the "Angel of All Germany," is stepping up preparations to build atomic armaments. Free Democrat Dehler is regarded as a heretic and attacked for sharply criticizing Adenauer's current policies. Members of the Federal Parliament are silenced. Due to rising prices, Economics Minister Erhard is overwhelmed. The fiscal deficit is increasing daily, and the budget cannot be balanced; this year, a deficit of 40 billion marks is expected. In this situation, many politicians with a reputation for being "honest officials" are taking advantage of the chaos to engage in rampant corruption and live an obscene and shameless life.

    都加重了
    西德经济部长艾哈德对工人和资本家说：“我们每一个人都必须负起更重的担子。”　（原载西德“另一种报”）
    以一当百
    在西方国家，资本家把工人当机器使用，可顾工人死活，想尽一切办法提高劳动强度，以榨取更多的利润。
                        （原载美国“国民前卫报”）
    敌人在内部
    美国统治集团借口美国的安全受到威胁，疯狂地扩充军备。实际上并没有任何人要侵略和威胁美国。相反地，美国的国内危机和忧患倒不少。例如，日益严重的广大青少年的犯罪狂，就引起某些资产阶级人士的忧虑。纽约先驱论坛报以“敌人在内部”为题刊载了这幅画。
    波恩官场群像
    在重新军国主义化的西德，政治日益腐败，经济困难也不断增长。自命为“全德天使”的阿登纳正加紧准备建立原子军备。自由民主党人戴勒因为尖锐地批评了阿登纳的现行政策，被目为异教徒而遭到打击。联邦议会的议员们被封口。由于物价不断高涨，经济部长艾哈德手忙脚乱。财政赤字日增，预算不能平衡，今年预计亏空四百亿马克。在这种局面下，许多打着“清官”招牌的政客却混水摸鱼，大肆贪污，过着荒淫无耻的生活。
