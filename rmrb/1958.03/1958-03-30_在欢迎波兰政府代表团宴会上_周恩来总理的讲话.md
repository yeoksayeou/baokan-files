    At the Banquet Welcoming the Polish Government Delegation
    Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

    Dear Comrade Jaroszewicz and all comrades of the delegation, comrades, friends:

    Last year, Comrade Cyrankiewicz, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic, and the government delegation he led paid a friendly visit to our country. Today, we have the opportunity to gather with Vice-Chairman Jaroszewicz and all the comrades of the Polish People's Republic Government Delegation again, and we are particularly happy. First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to extend a warm welcome to you.

    Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and the government, the Polish people have achieved great success in the cause of socialist construction. Currently, the Polish people are overcoming difficulties and striving to strengthen socialist construction. The Polish government has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy and has made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace. As a member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea and the International Supervisory and Control Commissions in Indochina, Poland, together with other member states, has made important contributions to maintaining peace in Asia. Not long ago, the Polish government's initiative to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe received widespread sympathy and support from many countries and peace-loving people around the world. The Chinese government and people fully support this peaceful initiative of the Polish government and believe that the realization of this proposal is of great significance for maintaining peace and security in Europe.

    China and Poland are brothers in the socialist family. The characteristic of this fraternal relationship is mutual help, mutual support, mutual cooperation, and seeking the common development of socialist construction. For the sake of the interests of all socialist countries and for the common interests of the socialist family, we believe that it is always necessary to develop this cooperative relationship between the fraternal countries. We are pleased to see that in the past few years, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Poland in various fields have been greatly strengthened. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the Polish people for their support and assistance to our socialist construction cause. You have come to our country this time for a visit and held negotiations with our government on economic cooperation issues. Through this negotiation, the economic cooperation between our two countries will be further strengthened. I believe that this will not only be conducive to the common economic upsurge of our two countries, but also to the strengthening of the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    Dear comrades and friends, I propose a toast:

    To the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Polish people,
    To the great unity of the socialist camp countries,
    To world peace,
    To the health of the leading comrades of the Polish United Workers' Party and the government headed by Comrades Gomulka, Zawadzki, and Cyrankiewicz,
    To the health of Comrade Jaroszewicz and all the comrades of the Government Delegation of the Polish People's Republic!

    在欢迎波兰政府代表团宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话亲爱的雅罗谢维奇同志和代表团的
    全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    去年，波兰人民共和国部长会议主席西伦凯维兹同志和他率领的政府代表团曾经到我国作了友好访问。今天，我们又有机会同雅罗谢维奇副主席和波兰人民共和国政府代表团全体同志们欢聚一堂，感到特别高兴。首先，请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向你们表示热烈的欢迎。
    波兰人民在波兰统一工人党和政府的领导下，在社会主义建设事业中获得了巨大的成就，目前波兰人民正在克服困难，为加强社会主义建设而奋斗。波兰政府一贯执行和平的外交政策，并且为和缓国际紧张局势和保卫世界和平的事业进行着不懈的努力。作为朝鲜中立国监察委员会和印度支那国际监督和监察委员会的成员，波兰同其他委员国一道，对于维护亚洲的和平作出了重要的贡献。不久以前，波兰政府提出的在中欧建立无原子武器区的倡议获得了许多国家和全世界爱好和平的人民的广泛同情和支持。中国政府和人民完全支持波兰政府的这一和平倡议，并且认为，这项建议的实现对于维护欧洲的和平和安全具有重大的意义。
    中波两国是社会主义大家庭中的兄弟，这种兄弟关系的特点就是相互帮助，相互支持，彼此合作，求得社会主义建设事业的共同发展。为了社会主义各国自己的利益，为了社会主义大家庭的共同利益，我们认为，永远需要发展各个兄弟国家之间的这种合作关系。我们高兴地看到在过去几年中，中波两国各方面的友好合作关系有了很大的加强，我们对于波兰人民在我国社会主义建设事业中给予我们的支持和帮助，表示衷心的感谢。你们这次来到我国访问，同我国政府进行了有关经济合作问题的谈判。通过这次谈判，我们两国的经济合作将进一步加强，我相信，这不仅有利于我们两国经济的共同高涨，而且有利于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量的加强。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，我提议：
    为中波两国人民牢不可破的友谊，
    为社会主义阵营各国的伟大团结，
    为世界和平，
    为以哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹同志为首的波兰统一工人党和政府的领导同志们的健康，
    为雅罗谢维奇同志和波兰人民共和国政府代表团全体同志们的健康，
    干杯！
