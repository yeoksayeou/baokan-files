    Expanding Irrigated Land, Promoting New Measures
    Yunnan's Flue-Cured Tobacco Output Doubles

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Yunnan Province, a nationally renowned producer of high-grade flue-cured tobacco, will see its total flue-cured tobacco output double this year compared to last year.

    Increasing yield per unit area is the main key to Yunnan Province's great leap forward in flue-cured tobacco production this year. Relevant provincial departments have sent technical personnel to flue-cured tobacco producing areas to investigate yield per unit area and summarize experiences in achieving high yields. Addressing the reasons for the low yield per unit area of flue-cured tobacco in various parts of Yunnan, this year various localities will expand the area of irrigated flue-cured tobacco planting based on expanding water conservancy and irrigation areas. In addition, advanced technical measures such as timely early planting, increased application of base fertilizer and topdressing will be promoted to eliminate the backward production habit of planting tobacco without fertilization. Various flue-cured tobacco experimental stations, key farms, and agricultural cooperatives will also vigorously carry out selection and retention of improved varieties and seed rejuvenation work. Jiangchuan, Yuxi and other areas with warm climates will expand the area of regeneration tobacco this year. After the implementation of the above-mentioned main measures and other measures, relevant provincial departments estimate that the average yield of flue-cured tobacco in the province this year can reach 173.6 jin per mu, and the total output can be doubled compared with last year with the planting area only increasing by 3.7% compared with last year.

    During the first Five-Year Plan period, the area under flue-cured tobacco cultivation in Yunnan also developed from 40 counties in 1953 to 92 counties and cities. Many border minority areas and mountainous areas have also been widely developed after successful trial planting.

### 扩大水浇地　推广新措施  云南烤烟产量增一倍

    扩大水浇地　推广新措施
    云南烤烟产量增一倍
    据新华社讯　国内驰名的高级烤烟产区云南省，今年烤烟总产量将比去年增一倍。
    提高单位面积产量，是云南省今年烤烟生产大跃进的主要关键。省有关部门曾派出技术人员到烤烟产区，对单位面积产量进行了调查，并总结了获得高额产量的经验。针对云南各地烤烟单位面积产量不高的原因，今年各地将在扩大水利灌溉面积的基础上，尽量增加水浇地的烤烟种植面积。另外，将推广适时早栽、增施基肥和追肥等先进技术措施，消灭栽烟不施肥的落后生产习惯。各烤烟试验站、重点农场及各农业社，也将大力进行选留良种及种籽复壮工作。江川、玉溪等气候温暖的地区今年要扩大再生烟的面积。上述主要措施和其他措施付诸实施后，省有关部门预计今年全省烤烟平均每亩产量可以达到一百七十三点六斤，在种植面积比去年只扩大3.7％的情况下，总产量可比去年增加一倍。
    在第一个五年计划期内，云南烤烟种植区域也由1953年的四十个县，发展到九十二个县市。许多边疆少数民族地区和山区，经过试种成功，也已普遍发展。
