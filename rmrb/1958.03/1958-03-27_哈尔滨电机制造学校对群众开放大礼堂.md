    Harbin Electrical Machinery Manufacturing School Opens Auditorium to the Public
    The Harbin Electrical Machinery Manufacturing School has opened its auditorium to the public. Nearby residents can watch movies and listen to current affairs reports in the auditorium. This is of great benefit to closely connecting with the masses and popularizing culture.
    In addition to opening the club, the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing School also opened its clinic to the employees of two nearby stores and the two hundred households in a small nearby village.

    哈尔滨电机制造学校对群众开放大礼堂
    哈尔滨电机制造学校对外开放大礼堂，附近群众可以在礼堂里看电影、听时事报告等，这对紧密联系群众和普及文化都大有好处。
    电机制造学校在开放俱乐部同时，还开放了卫生所。在附近有两个商店的职工和附近一个小屯的二百户居民。
