Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: Farmers in major cotton-producing areas such as Hebei, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, and Hubei are implementing various pre-sowing measures to increase production in order to achieve this year's leap forward plan for cotton production.

    Irrigating cotton fields is an important measure. Through large-scale water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring, the irrigated area of cotton fields in dryland cotton-growing areas nationwide can be expanded to 30 million mu, an increase of 18 million mu compared to 1957. In Hebei Province, over 80% of cotton fields can now be irrigated. In Shandong Province, 980,000 mu out of 2.73 million mu of irrigable cotton fields have already been winter-irrigated. In Guanzhong, Shaanxi, seven canals have already winter-irrigated 400,000 mu of cotton fields.

    Based on estimates from various regions, each mu of cotton field can be fertilized with more than 5,000 jin of farm manure this year, about double the amount in previous years.

    By the end of February, Shandong Province had accumulated enough fertilizer to apply 5,000 jin per mu. The minimum amount that can be applied to each mu of cotton field in Hebei is 5,000 jin. Counties like Gaotang and Xiajin in Shandong, Anguo, Gaocheng, and Cheng'an in Hebei, and Fenyang in Shanxi can apply more than 10,000 jin per mu.

    This year, the nation plans to expand the cultivation area of ​​high-quality Dai-character cotton varieties by 13 million mu, bringing the total cultivation area of ​​Dai-character cotton to over 50 million mu.

    The demonstration area for thorough prevention and control of cotton pests nationwide is also planned to expand from over 2.2 million mu last year to 39 million mu. Anguo County in Hebei Province plans to become a pest-free county this year.

    Training and instruction in cotton planting techniques are being actively carried out in various cotton-producing areas.

    棉区积极贯彻增产措施
    浇灌要早　种籽要好　技术要高
    据新华社21日讯　河北、陕西、河南、山东、湖北等主要棉花产地的农民为了实现今年的棉花生产跃进计划，正在贯彻执行播种前的各项增产措施。
    水浇棉田是一项重要措施。经过去冬今春大修水利，全国旱地棉区的棉田灌溉面积可以扩大到三千万亩，比1957年增加一千八百万亩。河北省已有80％以上的棉田可以用水灌溉；山东省的二百七十三万亩可以灌溉的棉田中，已有九十八万亩进行冬灌。陕西关中七条渠道已经冬灌棉田四十万亩。
    根据各地情况估计，今年每亩棉田可施农家肥料五千斤以上，比往年增加一倍左右。
    山东省到2月底所积肥料可供每亩施五千斤。河北棉田最少的每亩可施五千斤。山东的高唐、夏津，河北的安国、藁城、成安，山西的汾阳等县，每亩可施一万斤以上。
    今年全国计划扩大岱字棉良种种植面积一千三百万亩，使岱字棉种植总面积达到五千万亩以上。
    全国彻底防治棉虫的示范面积，也计划由去年的二百二十多万亩扩大到三千九百万亩。河北安国县计划要在今年内成为无虫县。
    植棉技术训练和传授工作正在各产棉区积极进行。
