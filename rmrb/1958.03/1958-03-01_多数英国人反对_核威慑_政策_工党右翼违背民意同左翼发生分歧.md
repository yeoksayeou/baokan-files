Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: London dispatch: A Gallup poll conducted by the "News Chronicle" shows that most Britons disagree with the Conservative government's "nuclear deterrent" policy.

The newspaper stated that 64% of those surveyed opposed the government's policy of using nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union (even if the Soviet Union only used conventional military equipment), while only 22% supported the policy.

Xinhua News Agency, London, March 28th: Left-wing and right-wing members of the Labour Party have openly disagreed on the vital issue of whether Britain should pursue a suicidal nuclear war policy.

The "Daily Herald," which was recently attacked by right-wing Labour Party members, published an editorial today, reiterating its belief that "Britain should not only stop testing hydrogen bombs but also stop manufacturing them." The paper said, "We suggest this because we believe that if this country makes such a significant and eye-catching example, the disarmament deadlock could be broken. Our goal is to hold a summit meeting under promising conditions."

The newspaper asked readers to answer whether they agree: 1. Refuse to test any more hydrogen bombs; 2. Stop manufacturing hydrogen bombs; 3. Refuse to agree to the establishment of rocket bases by the United States; 4. Refuse to allow bombers carrying hydrogen bombs to fly over British airspace.

Michael Foot, editor of "Tribune" magazine and a member of the newly formed left-wing group within the Labour Party, also criticized the government's defense strategy as deceptive and absurd in the "Daily Herald" today. He pointed out that more and more British people and newspapers, including the "Times," which he believes usually reflects the inner intentions of the Foreign Office and Downing Street, are dissatisfied with the British government's current defense policy.

However, while left-wing Labour Party members are fighting to get Britain to abandon its nuclear war policy and engage in peaceful negotiations with the East, there are indications that right-wing Labour Party members are adopting coercive measures to suppress the left-wing movement. Right-wing member Shinwell publicly defended the government in the House of Commons. He even said that the difference between the Labour Party's official policy and the British government's defense policy is not as sharp as the differences within the Labour Party itself.

Meanwhile, it is reported that the Labour Party Executive Committee has decided to require the leaders of the new left-wing group, including the group's chairman Frederick Mulley and president Stephen Swingler, to attend a meeting of the Executive Committee next week. It is revealed that the Executive Committee intends to take disciplinary action against some of the leaders of the new group.

Currently, this group has established a thirty-five-member executive committee, including ten members of parliament and many well-known Labour Party figures outside parliament. Labour MPs Mikardo (a member of the Labour Party Executive Committee), Zilliacus, and Davies are all members of this group. Some people call this group the "Bevanites without Bevan," because they formed this group out of disappointment with Bevan.

### 多数英国人反对“核威慑”政策  工党右翼违背民意同左翼发生分歧

    多数英国人反对“核威慑”政策
    工党右翼违背民意同左翼发生分歧
    新华社28日讯　伦敦消息：“新闻纪事报”举行的盖洛普民意测验结果表明：大多数英国人不同意保守党政府的“核威慑”政策。
    这家报纸说：反对政府要用核武器去对付苏联（即使苏联只使用常规军备）的这种政策的，占被调查者的64％，而赞成这种政策的只占22％。
    新华社伦敦28日电　工党左翼分子和右翼分子在英国是否应当奉行自杀性的核战争政策这个生死攸关的问题上发生了公开的分歧。
    最近遭到工党右翼分子攻击的“每日先驱报”今天发表社论，再一次表示它认为，“英国不仅应当停止试验氢弹，而且应当停止制造氢弹”。该报说，“我们这样建议，因为我们相信，这个国家要是作出这样重大的、引人注目的表率，裁军僵局是有可能打破的。我们的目的是使最高级会议在有希望开得成功的条件下举行”。
    该报要求读者们回答，他们是否同意：一：拒绝再试验任何氢弹；二、停止制造氢弹；三、拒绝答应美国设立火箭基地；四、拒绝允许载有氢弹的轰炸机飞越英国上空。
    “论坛周刊”编辑、工党内部新近成立的左翼集团成员之一迈克尔·福特今天也再次在“每日先驱报”上批评政府的国防战略是骗人的和荒谬的。他指出，越来越多的英国人民和报纸，包括他认为是通常反映外交部和唐宁街的心底打算的“泰晤士报”在内，都不满英国政府的现行防御政策。
    但是，虽然工党左翼分子正在为争取英国放弃核战争政策和同东方进行和平谈判而斗争，有迹象表明，工党右翼分子正在采取高压手段来压制左翼的运动。右翼分子辛威尔在下院公开地为政府进行辩护。他甚至说，工党的正式政策和英国政府的防御政策之间的分歧还没有工党本身的分歧那么尖锐。
    同时，据报道，工党执行委员会已决定要求新的左翼集团的领导人、包括这个新集团的主持人弗雷德里克·麦塞和主席斯蒂芬·斯文格勒下周前来执行委员会开会，据透露，执行委员会打算对新集团的一些领袖们采取惩戒行动。
    目前这个集团已经成立了一个三十五人的执行委员会，其中包括十名议员和议会外许多知名的工党人士。工党议员米卡多（工党执行委员会委员）、齐里亚库斯和戴维斯等都是这个集团的成员。有人把这个集团叫做“比万没有参加的比万派”，他们是因为对比万感到失望而成立这个集团的。
