Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: The General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, during the "Double Anti" campaign, formulated an outline (draft) of a Great Leap Forward plan for the army's logistics work. The outline requires maximizing the economical use of defense expenditures to support socialist construction. This year's various expenses should be reduced by another 7% through strengthening management, practicing strict economy, tapping potential, utilizing existing materials, and increasing extra-budgetary income. Itemized expenses should be reduced by another 10% to 40%, or even more, based on the already allocated targets.

The outline requires implementing the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, building the army through diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings through diligence and thrift, into practical work, so as to do more with less money. The staffing of logistics agencies at all levels should be reduced to the fixed quota, with no more personnel than necessary. The proportion of non-production personnel in military factories should be reduced to 5% to 8%, and the ratio of hospital staff to beds should be reduced to 0.8 to 1. Logistics colleges and universities should be run diligently and thriftily, and schools with suitable conditions should engage in work-study programs. The product cost of factories and enterprises under the logistics system should be reduced by another 5% to 10% this year, and the management fees of factories and enterprises should be reduced by another 15% to 30%. Product quality should also be improved, with first-class products reaching 99% or more, and all profits and depreciation funds should be turned over to the state. In terms of sideline production, the entire army should strive to achieve complete self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat within two to five years. Units with poor conditions should also strive for mostly or partially self-sufficiency, and gradually reduce or eliminate the need for vegetable allowances.

The outline proposes that logistics cadres strive to become both red and expert within three to five years, and strive to cultivate a team of red and expert specialists, professors, department directors, engineers, and other scientific and technical cadres within five years, and achieve significant results within two years. Carry out scientific and technological research, and strive to solve health security problems under high-altitude, high-temperature, plateau, and diving conditions within three to five years.

The outline requires eliminating or basically eliminating the "four pests" in military camps this year, and basically eliminating trachoma, malaria, Japanese encephalitis, and silicosis in engineering operations within two years.
