Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th: A report released by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board on the 17th stated that the U.S. economic recession continues to develop, and industrial production in February has fallen to its lowest point since December 1954.

The industrial production index for February was 130 (with the 1947-1949 average as 100), a decrease of 3 points from the January index of 133. Compared with the February 1957 index of 146, it has decreased by 16 points, or approximately 11%.

The report said: "Economic activity continued to decline in February. Industrial production, employment, income, and retail trade volume declined once again, and unemployment reached a new post-war peak. The construction industry also experienced a slight decline."

The Federal Reserve pointed out that the focus of the industrial production decline over the past year has been durable goods, which decreased by 16%. Production of durable goods for consumption decreased by 20%, falling to its lowest point since December 1953. The production volume of industrial machinery and equipment decreased by an average of 15%. In early March, automobile production continued to decline, and steel production remained at the low level of February without any improvement. The situation was the same for paper, chemicals, and petroleum refining. Mineral production continued to decline in February, and further declined in early March. The annual rate of construction in February was 890,000 houses, compared to 1.03 million in January.

At the same time, the number of unemployed people in major industrial areas of the United States continued to increase last week, and the total number of unemployed people has exceeded the unemployment peak of August 1941.

Official announcements on the 15th stated that the number of unemployed people in Michigan last week reached 415,000, accounting for 14.3% of the total labor force. Compared with the number in mid-February, this is an increase of 65,000 people.

The number of people applying for unemployment relief increased by another 440,000 in the first week of March. American newspapers pointed out that this phenomenon is particularly serious because the number of unemployed people usually decreases in March.

Henry McCarthy, New York City Welfare Commissioner, said on the 16th that the number of people applying for unemployment relief in New York City is nearly three times that of a year ago, with 900 people applying every day, compared to about 300 people per day during the same period last year.

He said that the situation in some cities is even more serious than in New York. The total number of people receiving relief in Chicago has increased by 50% compared to a year ago, and in Detroit by 80%.

American newspapers pointed out that the unemployment trend in early March has shattered President Eisenhower's boast that the American economic recession would begin to stop developing in March.

Eisenhower sent telegrams to the governors of nine states on the 17th, asking them to go to Washington on the 19th to discuss the increasingly serious unemployment problem.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 18th: A commentary published in the British "Time and Tide" magazine on the 15th stated that U.S. President Eisenhower has demonstrated a "lack of leadership" in the face of the economic crisis, and the United States is facing "the most serious internal crisis since Pearl Harbor."

The magazine said that the various economic measures suggested by Eisenhower and other U.S. officials, such as tax cuts, are "merely a mockery of the problem," and that these measures can only alleviate some "immediate needs," but "they do not help to provide a solution to the problem."

It said that many Americans have long lost confidence in Eisenhower's ability to handle foreign policy, and now they see that he is unable to handle a serious domestic problem.

The British magazine also worried that without American "prosperity," other parts of the "free world" cannot have "prosperity."

    美国经济衰退愈演愈烈
    上月工业生产比去年同期下降十六点
    申请失业救济的人数又增加四十四万
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国联邦储备局17日公布的报告说：美国经济衰退继续发展，2月份的工业生产已经下降到了1954年12月以来的最低点。
    2月份工业生产指数是一百三十（以1947—1949年平均数为一百），比1月份的指数一百三十三又下降了三点。同1957年2月的指数一百四十六相比，已经下降了十六点，也就是下降了大约11％。
    报告说：“2月份经济活动继续衰退。工业生产、就业、收入、零售贸易额又一次下降，失业达到了战后新的高峰。建筑业也有轻微下降。”
    储备局指出，过去一年中工业生产下降的重点是耐用品，它下降了16％。供消费用的耐用品生产减少了20％，而下降到了1953年12月以来的最低点。工业机器和设备的生产量平均下降了15％。3月初，汽车生产继续下降，钢的生产也停留在2月份的低水平上，没有起色。纸张、化学品、石油提炼的情况也是这样。矿产量在2月份继续下降，3月初又进一步下降。2月份的建筑年率是八十九万幢房屋，而1月份是一百零三万幢。
    同时，美国主要工业区的失业人数在上星期继续增加，失业总人数已经超过了1941年8月的失业高峰。
    15日官方宣布的上一星期密执安州失业人数达到了四十一万五千人，占劳工总数的14.3％。同2月中人数相比，增加了六万五千人。
    申请失业救济的人数在3月份第一个星期又增加了四十四万人。美国报纸指出，由于通常三月份的失业人数总是下降的，所以这个现象特别严重。
    纽约市福利委员亨利·麦克锡16日说，纽约市申请失业救济的人数将近一年前的三倍，每天有九百人提出申请，而去年同一时期每天大约只有三百人。
    他说，有些城市的情况比纽约更严重。芝加哥的救济总数比一年前增加了50％，底特律增加了80％。
    美国报纸指出，3月初的失业趋势已经使总统艾森豪威尔所吹嘘的美国经济衰退将在3月份开始停止发展的预言成了泡影。
    艾森豪威尔17日拍电报给九个州的州长，要他们19日去华盛顿商讨愈来愈严重的失业问题。
    新华社18日讯　伦敦消息：英国“时与潮”杂志15日刊载一篇评论说，美国总统艾森豪威尔在经济危机面前表现出“缺乏领导能力”，美国已经面临“珍珠港事件以来最严重的内部危机”。
    这家杂志说，艾森豪威尔以及其他美国官员所建议的各种经济措施，如减税等，“只不过是对问题的嘲弄”，这些措施只能救一些“燃眉之急”，“它们无助于提供一种解决问题的方法”。
    它说，许多美国人早已对艾森豪威尔处理外交政策的能力丧失信心，现在他们又看到他没有能力处理一个严重的国内问题。
    这家英国杂志还担心：如果没有美国的“繁荣”，“自由世界”的其他地方就不能有“繁荣”。
