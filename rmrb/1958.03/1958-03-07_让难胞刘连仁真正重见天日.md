    Let Compatriot Liu Lianren Truly See the Light of Day
    After reading the news "Escaping Persecution by the Japanese Army, Living in Caves in the Wilderness for Thirteen Years, Compatriot Liu Lianren Sees the Light of Day Again" published on page 5 of the People's Daily on February 28th, I deeply sympathize with and care about compatriot Liu Lianren's experiences, and express great anger at the barbaric crimes of Japanese militarists. However, the Japanese government's indifferent and extremely irresponsible attitude towards a Chinese resident who was illegally abducted and abused by Japanese invaders and escaped death is particularly infuriating.
    Now, although compatriot Liu Lianren has ended his inhuman life of fleeing in the wilderness, he is still living in a foreign land and cannot reunite with his family. The Japanese government should take effective measures to send Liu Lianren back to his own country. Only when Liu Lianren returns to the embrace of the motherland and reunites with his family can he truly "see the light of day."
    As a citizen of New China, I strongly protest the Japanese government's indifferent attitude towards our compatriot Liu Lianren, and resolutely demand that the Japanese government immediately send Liu Lianren back to China and be responsible for compensating all his losses.

    让难胞刘连仁真正重见天日
    读了2月28日人民日报第五版刊载的“逃避日本军迫害、穴居荒野十三年，难胞刘连仁重见天日”的消息后，我深深地同情和关怀难胞刘连仁的遭遇，并对日本军国主义者的野蛮罪行，表示极大的愤怒。可是日本政府竟然对这样一个被日本侵略者非法劫掳和虐待、死里逃生的中国居民采取漠不关心和极不负责任的态度，这是特别使人气愤的。
    现在，难胞刘连仁虽然已经结束了逃亡荒野的非人生活，但是仍然流落异乡，不能与家人团聚；日本政府理应采取有效措施，遣送刘连仁回到自己的祖国。只有让刘连仁回到祖国怀抱、与家人团聚，他才算是真正“重见天日”。
    作为一个新中国的公民，我强烈地抗议日本政府对我国难胞刘连仁采取漠不关心的态度，坚决要求日本政府立即把刘连仁送回中国，并负责赔偿他的一切损失。
