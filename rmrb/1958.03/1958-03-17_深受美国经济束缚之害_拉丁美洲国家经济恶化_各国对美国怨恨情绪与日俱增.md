Xinhua News Agency, March 15th dispatch from New York: Correspondents from "The New York Times" stationed in Latin American countries point out that Latin American countries are increasingly dissatisfied with the U.S.'s trade controls and economic shackles on Latin America.

The newspaper's correspondent from Rio de Janeiro said in an article: "In the first nine months of 1957, Latin America had a trade deficit of nearly $600 million with the United States alone, because imports increased by 20% compared with the same period in 1956, while exports to the United States increased by only 1%."

He pointed out that due to U.S. manipulation of prices, the prices of Latin American commodities generally declined last year. This has made "Latin Americans' dissatisfaction with the United States more and more intense throughout the year."

Schultz concluded that an "economic anti-Americanism" is developing in Latin America.

Another correspondent, Jones, also pointed out that Latin American countries' resentment towards the United States is growing, and they accuse the United States of treating Latin American commodity imports as a "tap" that is turned on when needed but turned off when the need is satisfied.

Correspondent Benjamin reported from Mexico City that although Mexico's total national output increased in 1957, the trade deficit was still around $100 million. Mineral production has been declining under the threat of increased tariffs by the United States.

Correspondent Waldman reported from Caracas that Venezuela already has "some ominous signs." These ominous signs are: the United States may further restrict oil imports, the U.S. economy may decline, and so on.

Correspondent Lepidus reported from San Salvador that authoritative data from El Salvador shows that the coffee production in 1957-1958 will be nearly 20% lower than in 1956-1957. Soybean exports, which account for an important part of government revenue, will be restricted due to the decline in prices in the New York market, and revenue in this area will be greatly reduced.

Correspondent Carti reported from Bogota that Colombia's currency is increasingly inflated, and its foreign trade debts amount to $460 million.

    深受美国经济束缚之害
    拉丁美洲国家经济恶化
    各国对美国怨恨情绪与日俱增
    据新华社15日讯　纽约消息：“纽约时报”驻拉丁美洲国家的记者指出，拉丁美洲国家愈来愈不满美国对拉丁美洲的贸易控制和经济束缚。
    这家报纸的记者从里约热内卢发来的一篇文章说：“在1957年的头九个月中，拉丁美洲仅仅是同美国一国的贸易逆差就将近六亿美元，因为进货数量比1956年同期增加了20％，而对美国的出口仅增加了1％。”
    他指出，由于美国操纵价格，拉丁美洲的商品价格去年普遍下降。这就使得“整整这一年中拉丁美洲人对美国的不满情绪越来越厉害”。
    舒耳茨总结说，拉丁美洲正在发展一种“经济上的反美主义”。
    另一个记者琼斯也指出，拉丁美洲国家对美国的怨恨日益增长，它们指责美国把拉丁美洲的商品进口当作一个“水龙头”，在有需要的时候就打开，但是在需要得到满足的时候就关上。
    记者本杰明从墨西哥城报道说，1957年墨西哥的全国总产量虽然有所增加，但是贸易逆差仍然有一亿美元左右。矿产量在美国提高关税的威胁下一直在下降。
    记者瓦耳德曼从加拉加斯报道说，委内瑞拉已经“隐隐出现一些不吉之兆”。这些不吉之兆是：美国可能进一步限制石油进口，美国的经济可能衰退等等。
    记者累皮杜斯从圣萨尔瓦多报道说，萨尔瓦多权威的资料表明：1957—1958年度的咖啡产量将比1956—1957年度减少将近20％。在政府收入中占重要地位的大豆出口，由于纽约市场价格下降，出口量将受限制，这方面的收入将大大减少。
    记者卡蒂从波哥大报道说，哥伦比亚通货日益膨胀，对外贸易欠债四亿六千万美元。
