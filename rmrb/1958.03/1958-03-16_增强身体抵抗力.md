Enhancing the Body's Resistance
    Fushi

The strength of a person's body resistance is a crucial key to whether or not they can overcome disease. Now is the season for infectious diseases to be prevalent, so how can we enhance people's resistance?

    (1) Improve the nervous system's adaptability: Every activity of the body is inseparable from the nervous system, so we call the nervous system (especially the brain) the body's command center. When disease factors invade the body, if the nervous system reacts quickly and can promptly mobilize the body's strength to resist the disease, the disease will not occur. For example, people who often work in the cold have higher resistance than those who are confined to warm rooms all day, because their nervous systems have adapted to the cold. To improve the nervous system's adaptability, it mainly depends on exercise (especially physical exercise and various sports), as well as a reasonable daily routine and constantly maintaining a revolutionary optimistic spirit, etc.

    (2) Maintain the integrity and cleanliness of the skin and mucous membranes: The skin and mucous membranes have natural bactericidal power. If bacteria are placed on a clean hand, after ten minutes, only 10% are still alive, and the remaining 90% are all dead. However, dirty skin is a breeding ground for bacteria.

    (3) Sufficient sleep: Sleep is a protective inhibition for the brain. People who suffer from insomnia and lack of sleep are most likely to get sick, and some latent diseases will flare up as a result. Experiments have shown that animals in hibernation have a high resistance to disease.

    (4) Appropriate nutrition: The body also has a line of defense against disease, which is "antibodies" and cells, all of which are composed of proteins and other nutrients. Vitamins also play an important role in the integrity and health of the skin and mucous membranes. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain various nutrients from a variety of staple and non-staple foods, especially from beans, vegetables, and coarse grains.

    (5) Make full use of the "priceless treasure" of nature – which is the inexhaustible supply of water, air, and sunlight. Fresh air makes the respiratory function of human tissues vigorous, allowing for the timely excretion of waste. Water is an important component of the body; most of the blood is water, which can dilute bacterial toxins, excrete toxins, and prevent people from being poisoned. The ultraviolet rays in sunlight can kill bacteria and can provide people with free vitamin D. Regular sunbathing increases the regulatory ability of the nervous system, makes the body's metabolism vigorous, and blood circulation smooth, thereby promoting the absorption of nutrients and the excretion of waste.

    (6) Regularly participate in physical exercise: Physical exercise can not only increase the sensitivity of the nervous system, as mentioned above; it can also make muscles developed, circulation vigorous, lung capacity increased, endurance increased, and digestive power enhanced. These changes all directly or indirectly enhance the body's resistance.

Disease and the human body are incompatible; it is either eliminated or the body is eliminated. Although scientists are trying to find a drug with the strongest antibacterial ability, such as penicillin, aureomycin, etc., which were all good drugs in the past. However, compared with the body's resistance, they can be considered insignificant. It can be said that only a person's resistance is the most effective "drug" with the broadest range of disease resistance. Pay attention to it!

    增强身体抵抗力

    人的身体抵抗力的强弱，是能不能战胜疾病的重要关键。现在正是传染病流行季节，怎样增强人的抵抗力呢？
    （一）提高神经系统的适应能力：身体的任何活动，都离不开神经系统，所以我们把神经系统（特别是大脑）叫做身体的司令部。当疾病因素侵入身体的时候，如果神经系统反应快，能够及时调动全身力量抵抗疾病，则疾病不会发生。例如经常在寒冷中工作的人，比终日关在暖室里的人抵抗力高，这是因为他们的神经系统对寒冷已有适应能力的缘故。要提高神经系统适应能力，主要靠锻炼（特别是体育锻炼及各种运动），以及合理的生活制度和经常保持革命的乐观精神，等等。
    （二）保持皮肤及粘膜的完整及清洁：皮肤和粘膜具有天然的杀菌力。把细菌放在清洁的手上，十分钟以后，只有10％还是活的，其余90％全死了。但是，脏皮肤却是细菌繁殖的温床。
    （三）充足的睡眠：睡眠对大脑来说是一种保护性的抑制。失眠及睡眠不足的人，最容易得病，一些潜伏着的疾病都会因此发作。实验证明，在冬眠状态的动物，对疾病具有很高的抵抗力。
    （四）适当的营养：身体里还有条抵抗疾病的防线是“抗体”及细胞，它们都是蛋白质和其他营养成份构成的。维生素对于皮肤及粘膜的完整及健康也起重要的作用。因此，要从多种花样的主副食、特别是从豆类、蔬菜及粗粮里去摄取各种养料。
    （五）充分利用大自然界的“无价宝”——这便是取之不尽，用之不竭的水、空气和日光。新鲜的空气使得人体组织的呼吸作用旺盛，能及时排泄废料。水分是身体的重要成分，血液大部分是水分，它能稀释细菌的毒素，排泄毒素，使人不致中毒。日光中的紫外线能杀菌，是可以使人获得免费的维生素丁。常晒太阳则神经系统调节能力增大，身体的新陈代谢旺盛，血液循环通畅，因而促进养料的吸收和废料的排泄。
    （六）经常参加体育锻炼：体育锻炼不仅可以使神经系统的灵敏性增加，如上所述；还可以使肌肉发达、循环旺盛、肺活量增大，耐久力增加，消化力量增强。这些改变都直接间接地增强了身体的抵抗力。
    疾病与人体是不两立的，不是它消灭，就是身体被消灭。虽然科学家都想寻找一种抗菌能力最强的药，过去如青霉素、金霉素等等，都是些好药。但是，与身体抵抗力比起来，可算是小巫见大巫。可以这样说，只有人的抵抗力是抗病范围最广最有效的一种“药”，重视它吧！
