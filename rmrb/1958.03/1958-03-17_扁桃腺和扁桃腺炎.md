    Tonsils and Tonsillitis
    In the Ear, Nose, and Throat clinic of the hospital, patients often complain recently: "My tonsils are inflamed again!" Indeed, tonsillitis is one of the epidemics that easily infect people in early spring.
    If you ask: "Where are the tonsils?" probably everyone will open their mouth and point to their throat, saying: "There." In fact, there is more than one pair of tonsils. At the root of the tongue, there is a pair, called lingual tonsils; at the opening of the Eustachian tube, there is another pair, called tubal tonsils; in the nasopharynx, there is also one, called the pharyngeal tonsil (also known as adenoids or vegetations); between the anterior and posterior pharynx, there is another pair, called palatine tonsils. These tonsils are all lymphatic tissues of the upper respiratory tract. Between the ages of five and ten, these tissues develop vigorously, producing "lymphocytes" (a type of white blood cell) and "antibodies," which can kill bacteria, so they play a role in protecting the body and should not be removed unless absolutely necessary. However, when people reach adolescence, these tonsils gradually lose their function and atrophy; among them, the pharyngeal tonsil almost completely disappears by adulthood.
    What we are going to talk about here is the last pair—the palatine tonsils. This pair is the largest and truly resembles almonds. What people see when they open their mouths is them; and what people usually refer to as tonsillitis refers to them.
    Originally, on the surface of the palatine tonsils, there are many "crypts" (branch-like deep recesses) that often harbor food residues and secretions, which are good places for bacteria to breed and multiply. This is an important cause of tonsillitis. However, catching a cold, overwork, physical weakness, other diseases, etc., often become inducements for tonsillitis, because the body's resistance is particularly weak at this time.
    Once tonsillitis occurs, it often comes on very quickly, with body temperatures as high as 39 degrees Celsius or even above 40 degrees Celsius, accompanied by chills, and the throat is sore and swollen, making it difficult to speak or drink water. At this time, you should rest in bed, drink plenty of boiled water, rinse your mouth frequently with salt water, or take 0.5 grams of aspirin to reduce fever and relieve pain. After a few days, most of the symptoms will disappear and heal. However, it is best to see a doctor, because it can often be complicated by other serious diseases such as otitis media, arthritis, endocarditis, etc.
    Some acute tonsillitis also has a symptom of white membranes growing on the palatine tonsils, which can easily be confused with diphtheria. In fact, the white membrane of the former is just some yellowish-white secretions, which sometimes connect into a sheet, but will never spread beyond the palatine tonsils; while the latter is a grayish-white real "pseudomembrane" that adheres to the palatine tonsils and invades the surrounding areas, and cannot be wiped off. At the same time, the former type of patient has a flushed face and is in good spirits; the latter type of patient has a pale face, is listless, and looks seriously ill.
    Acute tonsillitis often recurs repeatedly, eventually becoming chronic tonsillitis, and the latter often promotes the recurrence of the former, so it is best to cure it completely. However, complete cure is not only achieved by removal. Children under the age of five and a small number of adults should not have them removed. Only by maintaining good oral hygiene and exercising can one effectively prevent tonsillitis.

    扁桃腺和扁桃腺炎
    在医院的耳鼻喉科门诊室里，最近常有病人诉说：“我的扁桃腺又发炎了！”确实，扁桃腺炎在早春天气是容易使人感染的流行病中的一种。
    如果问一下：“扁桃腺在哪里？”大概谁都会张开嘴来指指咽喉处说：“在那里。”其实，扁桃腺不止一对。在舌根处，有一对，叫舌扁桃腺；在耳咽管口，又有一对，叫耳咽管口扁桃腺；在鼻咽部，还有一个，叫咽扁桃腺（又叫腺样体或增殖体）；在前后咽之间，还有一对，叫颚扁桃腺。这些扁桃腺都是上呼吸道淋巴腺样组织。人在五岁到十岁之间，这些组织发育旺盛，产生“淋巴球”（白血球的一种）和“抗体”，能够消灭细菌，所以起着保护身体的作用，不到万不得已是不宜割掉的。但是，人到青春发育期，这些扁桃腺都因逐渐失去作用而萎缩下去；其中咽扁桃腺，到人成年，它就几乎完全消失了。
    这里要谈的，是那最后一对——颚扁桃腺。这对最大，真正形似扁桃。人们一张嘴看到的，就是它；平日说的扁桃腺发炎，指的也是它。
    原来在颚扁桃腺的上面，有许多“陷窠”（树枝状的深凹），经常藏着食物的残渣和分泌物，是细菌孳生和繁殖的好所在，这便是扁桃腺发炎的重要原因。但是，着凉感冒、过度劳累、身体衰弱、其他疾病等等，也往往成为扁桃腺发炎的诱因，因为这时候人的抵抗力特别弱。
    扁桃腺一发炎，来势常常很急，体温高到摄氏39度甚至40度以上，伴有寒战，喉咙又痛又胀，连说话、喝水都发生困难。这时候要卧床休息，多饮开水，常用盐水漱口，或服阿司匹灵0.5克退热止痛。这样过几天，病状大多数就会消失到痊愈。但是，最好还是请医生看一下，因为它常常可能并发其他严重的疾病如中耳炎、关节炎、心内膜炎等。
    有些急性扁桃腺炎还有一种症状是颚扁桃腺上长着白膜，因而容易和白喉病混同。其实，前者的白膜只是一些黄白色的分泌物，有时候会连成一片，但决不会漫延到颚扁桃腺以外去；而后者，却是灰白色的一种真正的“假膜”，粘附在颚扁桃腺上，还会侵犯到四周去，擦也擦不掉。同时，前一种病人面色潮红，精神较好；后一种病人却面色苍白，精神萎糜，一副重病容模样。
    急性扁桃腺炎还常常会屡次反复发生，结果就成为慢性扁桃腺炎，而后者又常常反过来促进前者再发生，所以最好根治。但根治并不是只有割掉一法，五岁以下的孩子和少数成年人是不宜割的。只有经常保持口腔卫生和锻炼身体，才是积极预防扁桃腺发炎的牢靠办法。
