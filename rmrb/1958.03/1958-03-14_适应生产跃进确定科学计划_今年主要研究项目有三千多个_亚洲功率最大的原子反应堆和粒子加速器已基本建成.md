Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: Wu Heng, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council's Science Planning Commission, in his "Explanation on the State of Scientific and Technological Research Work in 1957 and the Scientific and Technological Research Plan for 1958" given at the fifth meeting of the Science Planning Commission on the 5th, spoke about the achievements of China's scientific and technological research work last year and this year's research plan.

Last year's scientific and technological research results were numerous. Wu Heng cited some of the projects in his report. The atomic reactor and particle accelerator, the most powerful in Asia, which the Soviet Union helped China build, have basically been completed. China's own high-pressure electrostatic accelerator, high-voltage multiplier, and β-ray spectrometer, and other advanced equipment for researching atomic physics, have been completed. The purification of semiconductor germanium has met the requirements; semiconductor diodes and triodes, which can replace electron tubes and are much more effective, have been successfully trial-produced. In terms of surveying and researching ancestral resources and natural conditions, a comprehensive survey of 350,000 square kilometers has been completed in areas with severe soil erosion in the middle reaches of the Yellow River; soil surveys of approximately 200,000 square kilometers have been conducted in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River basin. The initial drafts of the Huai River and Liao River basin plans, the key points of the Hai River basin plan, and the key points of the Yangtze River basin plan have all been completed; the comprehensive utilization of the Heilongjiang River was surveyed in cooperation with the Soviet Union. In a large number of geological exploration projects, many new deposits of coal, iron, oil, manganese, copper, lead, zinc, aluminum, molybdenum, and other minerals have been discovered, and abundant boron, potassium, and other inorganic salt resources have been discovered in the Qinghai area. In terms of cooperating with national industrial construction, the study of the comprehensive utilization of the Baotou iron ore found a method for extracting rare earth compounds from the ore; the study and adoption of advanced technology in blast furnace operation has greatly exceeded the utilization rate of effective blast furnace capacity in the United Kingdom and the United States; the production technology of twelve rare metals has been mastered and can be transferred to industrial production; the research and successful production of synthetic petroleum using iron catalysts has enabled China to achieve a very high level of synthetic petroleum production, which is not only a major scientific and technological achievement, but also can reduce the cost of synthetic petroleum by more than 50% economically. In terms of agricultural science, further regional identification of various major crops has been carried out, and the adaptive promotion areas of several excellent varieties have been preliminarily clarified; many excellent varieties have been selected, among which "612" and "134" wheat have been promoted in Wugong and Zhouzhi, Shaanxi, with yields 10% to 50% higher than Bima No. 1. In medicine, the research on the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis was a key task this year, and achievements were made in prevention and treatment methods, observation of snail ecology, and early diagnosis. The level of surgical treatment for heart, large blood vessel diseases, and bone and joint tuberculosis has been significantly improved; a large amount of research work has also been carried out on traditional Chinese medicine, proving that *Rauvolfia* produced in South China has the effect of lowering blood pressure. Basic research on natural science has also yielded many new research results with high academic levels.

He said that in 1957, the Party and the government strengthened their leadership over scientific undertakings; the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in leading scientific and cultural undertakings was further implemented; the Party dispatched a large number of outstanding cadres to strengthen the cultural, educational, and scientific fronts; the Fourth Enlarged Meeting of the State Council's Science Planning Commission resolved the issue of the national science work system, and organized the scientific forces of various systems nationwide. Wu Heng talked about the improvement of other scientific working conditions last year.

Wu Heng's report put forward the National Science and Technology Research Plan for 1958. This plan was approved in principle at this meeting. There are more than 3,000 major research projects planned for this year, an increase of 389 from last year. In terms of industry and natural resources, this year's key research projects include establishing a research work base for high-temperature alloys, metal ceramics, aluminum-magnesium alloys, titanium, and others; based on the results of surveys and research conducted throughout the country in recent years, in addition to continuing resource surveys this year, a plan for China's natural zoning and economic zoning will be proposed; vigorously developing the production of various chemical fibers: such as nylon 66 and other synthetic fibers, glass fiber for textiles, research work on viscose fiber, and research work on new types of plastics, special cement, refractory materials for all-alkaline open-hearth furnaces, and high-strength glass; research on the rational utilization of a large number of agricultural by-products, such as using cotton stalks instead of wood to make paper; research on various new types of transportation tools suitable for China's fuel resource conditions, such as gas cars, electric trains, gas internal combustion locomotives, and ocean-going freighters; conduct research on national building climate zoning to solve the problem of rational design and reduce construction costs, and lay the foundation for research on "national building zoning"; conduct comprehensive research on seismic activity in the Gansu area, propose seismic measures, and compile China's seismic zone building codes. In agriculture, research the production technology of high-efficiency chemical fertilizers (superphosphate and urea, etc.) to provide scientific data for factory construction; research methods to reduce the production cost of nitrogen fertilizer - research the process of producing hydrogen from gaseous hydrogen compounds; conduct comprehensive research on high-yield technical measures for several major crops in China, such as rice, wheat, cotton, and oil crops such as soybeans, peanuts, and rapeseed; improve existing agricultural tools and create new agricultural machinery; provide a reliable hydrological basis for large-scale construction of small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, and study hydrological calculation and hydrological forecasting methods for small and medium-sized rivers; in order to solve the problem of reservoir siltation, study the problem of density currents. In medicine, research methods for preventing and treating schistosomiasis, including eliminating snails, killing insect eggs, preventing cercariae, and finding new and improving existing Chinese and Western medicine treatment methods and preventive measures; master the production process of four new antibiotics - "tetracycline" and oxytetracycline, which can resist various bacteria and large viruses, "nystatin," which can resist fungi (such as nail fungus, which is caused by fungi), and "erythromycin," which can resist Gram-positive bacteria (such as purulent inflammation), and also look for other new antibiotics that can inhibit various pathogens and new anti-tuberculosis antibiotics. In basic science, biophysics should be established. In mathematics, to cooperate with the establishment of computing technology, research on programming and approximation methods, research on differential equations and probability theory should be conducted; in physics, research on the crystal structure, deformation, strength, and spectroscopy and its application of China's abundant metal antimony, iron, and copper should be conducted; in chemistry, research on the relationship between the chemical structure and properties of substances and organoelement compounds should be conducted; in addition, instrumentation analysis should be strengthened.

Wu Heng pointed out that in the actual implementation of this year's research plan, it must be adapted to the requirements of the Great Leap Forward in production, and revised and supplemented.
