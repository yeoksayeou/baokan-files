County-Run Factories
    Serving Agricultural Production, Serving Large-Scale Industry
    Serving People's Livelihood, Serving Foreign Trade - Huangyan
    In the next five years, Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, plans to expand and renovate its existing iron factory, water pump factory, etc., into machinery manufacturing plants specializing in the production of new-style agricultural tools, water pumps, and electric motors. It will also expand the existing ironware cooperatives into large and medium-sized agricultural machinery repair stations, and establish small repair stations in every township, forming a machinery repair and fitting network to gradually realize agricultural mechanization. The county will build a hydroelectric power station with a generating capacity of several thousand kilowatts, and combine water conservancy and manure accumulation to build a large number of small hydroelectric power stations and biogas power stations, forming a power grid. It will mine lead, zinc, and pyrite, and build sulfuric acid plants and chemical fertilizer plants. Using tree roots and other waste materials as raw materials for new pesticide factories, it will produce large quantities of insecticides and bacterial fertilizers. In this way, local industry can support agriculture in all aspects.
    
    Jingshan
    Jingshan County, Hubei Province, has established a small granular fertilizer plant.
    This plant can produce more than 30,000 catties of granular fertilizer per month. The raw material used is mainly garbage, and more than 30 catties of this fertilizer can be used as base fertilizer for one mu of land.
    During the construction of the factory, the walls of the warehouse were used, and only some wood and reed mats were purchased to build a shed. With the addition of some sieves, dustpans, shovels, and hoes, the total cost was 203 yuan.
    
    Zhuhai
    Zhuhai County, Guangdong Province, which has a developed fishing industry, will build three factories serving fisheries production this year. These factories are: Tangjia Power Plant, Xiangzhou Ice Plant, and Fish Meal Plant.
    The Tangjia Power Plant, which started generating electricity during the Spring Festival, has a generating capacity of 80 kilowatts according to its equipment capacity. The Xiangzhou Ice Plant, which is under construction and will be put into production in the second quarter of this year, can produce 15 tons of ice per day. The county's abundant seafood can be refrigerated and transported to major cities across the country using the ice produced by this plant. The fish meal plant, which uses various fish scraps, shrimp scraps, and crab scraps as raw materials, can produce three tons of fish meal per day after it is put into production.
    
    Jiujiang
    A cotton seed delinting plant has been newly built in Xingang, Jiujiang County, Jiangxi Province.
    The short lint attached to cotton seeds is an industrial raw material with a wide range of uses. The first-cut short lint can be used for cotton wadding and spinning coarse yarn; the second and third-cut short lint can be used to make film and rayon. In order to make full use of this resource, the Jiangxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative built seven delinting plants in seven major cotton-producing counties, namely Jiujiang, Pengze, Hukou, Duchang, Ruichang, Jinxian, and Boyang, in 1957. When all are completed, they can produce more than 35,000 dan of short lint annually, which can spin more than 9,000 pieces of cotton yarn and weave more than 34,000 chi of cloth.
    
    Xinzhou
    More than 7,000 cadres, workers, and teachers in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, have raised funds to build a fertilizer plant with an annual output of 20 million catties of granular fertilizer. This fertilizer plant is expected to be basically completed in the latter half of this month. After the plant is put into production, it can solve the problem of base fertilizer for more than 200,000 mu of land.
    The plant has been established in three locations, in the towns of Chengguan, Cangbu, and Yangluo, according to the source of fertilizer.
    
    Yunnan
    This year, four border ethnic autonomous prefectures and two border special districts in Yunnan Province will build a total of 655 small factories. By the end of the year, each border autonomous prefecture will have a large number of agricultural product processing factories, chemical fertilizer plants, and mines, and most of them will be able to manufacture their own small gas or steam tractors, water turbine generators, etc. Each autonomous prefecture has decided that all newly built industrial and mining enterprises will not build houses this year, and will use thatched sheds instead of factory buildings and staff dormitories to save funds for the purchase of equipment.

### 县县办工厂  为农业生产服务　为大型工业服务  为人民生活服务　为对外贸易服务黄岩

    县县办工厂
    为农业生产服务　为大型工业服务
    为人民生活服务　为对外贸易服务黄岩
    浙江省黄岩县要在今后五年内将现有的铁工厂、水泵厂等扩建、改建为专门生产新式农具、水泵和电动机的机械制造厂；将现有的几个铁器社扩建为农业机械大、中修理站，并在乡乡建立小型修理站，组成机械修配网，逐步实现农业机械化；建立一座发电数千瓩的水力发电站，并结合修水利和积肥，建立大量小型水电站和沼气发电站，组成电力网；开采铅、锌矿和黄铁矿，建造硫酸厂和化学肥料厂；利用树根等废料作为新建农药厂的原料，生产大量杀虫药剂和细菌肥料。这样，地方工业就能从各个方面来支援农业。
    京山
    湖北省京山县兴办一个小型颗粒肥料厂。
    这个厂每月可生产颗粒肥料三万多斤，所用原料主要是垃圾，每三十多斤这样的肥料就可以做一亩田的底肥。
    建厂中，利用仓库的围墙，只买了点木料和芦席搭了个棚子，加上一些筛子、簸子、锹、挖锄，总共花了二百零三元钱。
    珠海
    渔业发达的广东省珠海县今年要兴建三座为渔业生产服务的工厂。这些工厂是：唐家电厂、香洲冰厂、鱼粉厂。
    已经在春节期间开始发电的唐家电厂，按照设备能力，发电量可达八十瓩。正在建设的香洲冰厂在今年第二季度投入生产后，每日可产冰十五吨。这个县盛产的海鲜，可以用这个厂出产的冰冷藏运销全国各大城市。利用各种鱼杂、虾杂、蟹杂作原料的鱼粉厂投入生产后，每天可生产鱼粉三吨。
    九江
    江西省九江县新港新建成一座棉籽脱绒厂。
    棉籽上附着的短绒，是一种用途很广的工业原料。头道短绒能作棉絮、纺粗纱；二、三道短绒可以做胶卷和人造丝。为了充分利用这一资源，江西省供销合作社1957年在九江、彭泽、湖口、都昌、瑞昌、进贤、波阳七个主要产棉县建设七座脱绒厂。全部建成后，每年可产短绒三万五千多担，可纺九千多件棉纱，织三万四千多尺布。
    新洲
    湖北新洲县七千多干部、职工和教员，集资兴建一座年产二千万斤颗粒肥料的肥料厂。这座肥料厂预计本月下旬就可以基本建成。这个厂投入生产以后，可以解决二十多万亩田的底肥问题。
    这个厂根据肥源决定分三处设立，在城关、仓埠、阳逻三镇各设一处。
    云南
    云南省四个边疆民族自治州、两个边疆专区今年共将建设六百五十五个小型工厂。到年底，每个边疆自治州将都有大批农产品加工工厂、化学肥料厂和采矿场，而且大部都能自己制造小型煤气或蒸气拖拉机、水轮发电机等。各自治州决定，今年新建的工矿企业一律不盖房子，用茅草棚子代替厂房和职工宿舍，节省资金购买设备。
