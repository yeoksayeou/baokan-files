    Telling Stories
    He Yi
    It's troublesome when you encounter a child like Xiao Li when telling stories. But, what can you do! I have to tell Xiao Li stories every day!
    My children loved to listen to me tell stories when they were young. No, I should say they loved listening to stories, no matter who told them. But, as these children got older, I didn't like telling them as much. Well, to be honest, it's not that I didn't like telling them, it's that they didn't like listening. Because my storytelling skills were really not very good, neither vivid nor with intonation, and my expression was dull. Moreover, the stories were all made up on the spot, both simple and boring, and many of them were repetitive.
    However, there was always someone who wanted to listen to me tell stories, even if they were just little children, it was better than no one listening.
    However, telling stories to Xiao Li was not very convenient. I really didn't expect this three-and-a-half-year-old child to be so stubborn and so confident! He wouldn't let me "make up" stories, I could only finish the story under his guidance.
    Isn't that right, originally I thought I should make such an attempt, to tell the story in a fresh and unique way. The stories I told before were nothing more than a big white horse and a water buffalo, you kick, I kick, and the wolf was beaten to death; or a weasel went to Farmer Uncle's house to steal chickens and was bitten to death by a yellow dog, etc., in a word, bad things all encountered bad luck. I myself felt that these stories were too "formulaic." I was determined to improve, but I ran into a wall the first time.
    "...That big, colorful rooster desperately fled and fled, and the fox desperately chased and chased behind!" I narrated, saying: "Ah, there's a big river, there's no bridge on the river, the big, colorful rooster can't get across, what to do? The fox is about to catch up!..."
    Before I could think of how to continue the story, Xiao Li immediately jumped up and said loudly: "No, there's a bridge on the river! The big, colorful rooster ran across the bridge!"
    "There's no bridge!"
    "No! There's a bridge. There is a bridge!"
    What can you do? If there's a bridge, there's a bridge, I let the colorful rooster run across the bridge.
    Xiao Li sat down leaning against my knees with satisfaction, and his tense expression was also relieved.
    I thought, since the colorful rooster crossed the bridge, it seemed there was no reason not to let the fox cross the bridge. So I continued the story: "The fox saw, ah, the colorful rooster crossed the bridge? Then I'll chase after it too!
  'Hey, colorful rooster! Where are you escaping to? You better obediently come into my mouth!' Saying that, the fox also chased across the bridge,..."
    "Ah, no! No!" Xiao Li hurriedly stood up again, shaking my hand and shouting. "There's a banana peel on the bridge! Someone threw it. The fox kicked it, fell down, and rolled into the river. The fox shouted 'Help, help!' The colorful rooster said 'Serves you right!' No one went to save him, and the fox drowned!"
    Alas, what can you do? I originally wanted to be generous and let this fox have a good meal of chicken, but Xiao Li resolutely wanted to execute it. I wanted to persuade Xiao Li to let the fox cross the bridge, I said my story was new, and it would be more interesting to tell it later. However, Xiao Li wouldn't calm down. It seemed this fox deserved its bad luck, and there wasn't even hope for a suspended sentence.
    "Why does the fox have to drown?" I asked helplessly.
    "The fox wants to eat the colorful rooster," Xiao Li said.
    "It doesn't matter if it eats the colorful rooster."
    "Um, no, no! The colorful rooster will help people do things. It will wake us up, the colorful rooster is good. The fox is a bad guy."
    "Does that mean bad guys can't eat colorful roosters?"
    "No! Just can't! Don't let bad guys bully good people! Don't let bad guys bully good people!" Xiao Li replied, tears flashing in his dark eyes. "Don't tell it, I don't want to hear this story!"
    I hurriedly expressed that I would make amends for my sins, ended the story hastily according to Xiao Li's instructions, letting the fox be buried in the flowing water of the river, and solemnly explained: The colorful rooster still returned to his own home, without even losing a single feather. Then, I told another story with a happy ending, and Xiao Li happily listened to the end, and warmly said good night to me, and soon fell asleep without any worries.
    From this time on, I had to continue to tell those "formulaic" stories every day. It seemed Xiao Li was not tired of them at all. He always enthusiastically protected the kind characters in the story from being harmed by anyone, and uncompromisingly demanded to change all unpleasant endings.
    As for me, although I was a little regretful for not breaking the "formulaic" nature, I quickly realized that destroying that precious belief of young children, trampling on their pure feelings, was simply an immoral criminal act, and would make myself even more regretful.

### 讲故事

    讲故事
    贺宜
    讲故事的时候，要是遇到像小力这样的孩子，就麻烦了。不过，有什么办法呢！我每天非得给小力讲故事不可！
    我的孩子们幼小的时候都很爱听我讲故事。不，应该说他们爱听故事，不管谁讲的都好。可是，这些孩子年纪一大，我就不那么爱跟他们讲了。嗯，说老实话，不是我不爱讲，是他们不爱听。因为我讲故事的本领实在不太高明，既不会绘形绘色，又加声调平板，表情呆滞。而且故事又都是信口胡诌，既简单又乏味，其中还有许多是重复的。
    不过，总归还有人要听我讲故事，尽管是些小娃娃，也比没有一个人要听好一些。
    可是，跟小力讲故事却不是很方便的。真想不到，这三岁半的孩子是那么固执而且又是那么自信！他不让我“胡编”故事，我只能在他的指导下把故事讲完。
    可不是吗，本来我以为我应该作这样的尝试，把故事讲得新鲜一点，别致一点。以前讲的那些个故事呀，无非是什么大白马和水牛，你一脚，我一角，把狼打死了；或者是黄鼠狼到农民伯伯家里去偷鸡，给黄狗咬死了等等，一句话，就是坏东西都碰到了倒楣的事情。这些故事连我自己也觉得太“公式主义”了。我决心改进一下，可是，第一回就碰了壁。
    “……那只大花公鸡拚命逃啊逃啊，狐狸在后面拚命追啊追啊！”我叙述着说：“啊呀，到了一条大河啦，河上没有桥，大花公鸡过不去，怎么办呢？狐狸快要追上来了！……”
    我还没有想好怎样把故事说下去，小力马上跳起来，大声说：“不，大河上有桥！大花公鸡走桥上跑过去了！”
    “没有桥啊！”
    “不吆！有桥。就有桥！”
    有什么办法呢？有桥就有桥吧，我让花公鸡跑过了桥。
    小力满意地靠着我的膝盖坐下，紧张的神色也解除了。
    我想，既然花公鸡过了桥，似乎也没理由不让狐狸过桥去。我就接着故事说：“狐狸一看，啊，花公鸡过桥啦？那我也追过去！
  ‘喂，花公鸡！你往哪逃呀？还是乖乖地到我嘴里来吧！’说着，狐狸就也追过桥去，……”
    “啊，不！不！”小力又赶忙站起来，摇着我的手叫。“桥上有香蕉皮！是人家扔的。狐狸脚一踹，摔了一交，就滚到河里去。狐狸喊‘救命啊，救命啊！’花公鸡说‘活该！’谁也不去救他，狐狸就淹死了！”
    唉，有什么办法呢？我原想慷慨一下，让这狐狸饱吃一顿鸡肉的，不想小力坚决要把它执行死刑。我想说服小力放这狐狸过桥，我说我这故事是新的，下边讲下去更有趣哩。可是，小力不肯静下来。看来这狐狸也活该倒楣，连缓刑的希望也没有。
    “狐狸为什么非得淹死呢？”我无可奈何地问。
    “狐狸要吃花公鸡。”小力说。
    “吃花公鸡也不要紧呀。”
    “嗯，不，不！花公鸡会帮助人做事。会叫我们起床，花公鸡好。狐狸是坏蛋。”
    “坏蛋就一定不能吃花公鸡呀？”
    “不能！就不能！不让坏蛋欺负好人！不让坏蛋欺负好人！”小力回答着，黑黑的眼珠里闪出泪花来。“别讲了，我不听这个故事！”
    我慌忙表示带罪立功，照着小力的指点，把这故事草草结束，让狐狸葬身在大河的流水中，还郑重交代：这花公鸡仍旧回到了自己的家里，连毛没丢落一根。接着，又讲了一个有欢乐的结局的故事，这样小力才欢天喜地的听完，还和我亲热地道了晚安，不久，就无牵无挂地睡着了。
    从这一回以后，我只好每天仍旧讲那些“公式主义”的故事。看来小力丝毫也没有厌倦。他始终热忱地保护着故事中的那些善良的人物，不受任何人的侵害，并且毫不妥协地要求改变一切不愉快的结局。
    我吗，固然因为没有打破“公式化”有点儿遗憾，可是，我很快意识到，摧毁幼小的孩子的那种宝贵的信念，践踏他们的纯厚的感情，简直就是不道德的犯罪行为，是更会使自己遗憾的。
