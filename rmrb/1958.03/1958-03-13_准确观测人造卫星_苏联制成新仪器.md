Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 12th – TASS reports: The Soviet Union has recently developed a new instrument for observing artificial earth satellites using photographic methods. This specially designed instrument can determine the precise moment a satellite passes a certain location with an accuracy of approximately one three-thousandth of a second.

The use of this new instrument can greatly increase the accuracy of observations, which will help solve some major problems related to satellite operation. This will make it possible not only to predict the satellite's position more accurately and determine the rate at which the satellite slows down with each orbit, but also to determine which places in an orbit the satellite travels faster and which places it travels slower.

    准确观测人造卫星
    苏联制成新仪器
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最近制成了一种以照相方法观测人造地球卫星的新仪器，这种结构特殊的仪器确定卫星通过某一地点的精确程度可以达到三千分之一秒左右。
    运用这种新仪器可以大大增加观测的精确性，有助于解决与卫星运行有关的某些大问题。这样就可能不仅更精确地预报卫星的位置，确定卫星每运行一圈所减缓的速度，而且可以确定在一圈中那些地方卫星运行速度较快，那些地方较慢。
