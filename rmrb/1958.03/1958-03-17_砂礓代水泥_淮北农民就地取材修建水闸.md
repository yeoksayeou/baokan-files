Using Ferruginous Conglomerate Instead of Cement
Huaibei Farmers Build Sluice Gates with Local Materials

(Our newspaper, Fuyang, 14th dispatch) The Fuyang Special District is now vigorously promoting the method of building sluice gates with ferruginous conglomerate by utilizing local materials. When digging ditches and ponds for water conservancy construction in Huaibei, many places have dug into ferruginous conglomerate layers. Ferruginous conglomerate is as hard as stone and has poor permeability. The reporter saw ferruginous conglomerate gates in the Fuguang Tenth Cooperative in Fuyang County and the Shunhe Agricultural Cooperative in Funan County. The ferruginous conglomerate bridge and gate of Fuguang Tenth Cooperative can allow heavy-duty vehicles and tractors to pass on three sides. Engineering technicians and Soviet experts who came to visit believe that the quality is very good.

Using ferruginous conglomerate to build gates was a method created by Wei Chengyou, a cadre sent to the countryside in Fuyang County, leading the members of the Fuguang Tenth Cooperative. They used ferruginous conglomerate, lime, and clay to build a ferruginous conglomerate gate that is 8.5 meters long, 1.6 meters wide in aperture, and 2 meters deep. They used large ferruginous conglomerate blocks to build the gate arch, filled the holes with small ferruginous conglomerate mixed with clay, and plastered the seams with lime, using only more than 700 workdays and 52 yuan of funds. If bricks and cement were used to build the gate, it would require 90,000 bricks, 40,000 jin of cement, and other materials, requiring an investment of 16,000 yuan.

Ferruginous conglomerate is found everywhere in Huaibei. Using it to replace bricks and stones for construction is utilizing local materials and turning waste into treasure. Now, in the water conservancy projects in Huaibei, every place has thousands of culverts and gates built with ferruginous conglomerate, greatly accelerating the progress of water conservancy projects.

    砂礓代水泥
    淮北农民就地取材修建水闸
    本报阜阳14日电　阜阳专区现在正大力提倡就地取材，用砂礓建闸的办法。淮北在兴修水利挖沟塘时，许多地方都挖到了砂礓层，砂礓坚硬如石，透水性差。记者在阜阳县阜光十社和阜南县顺河农业社，都看到了砂礓闸。阜光十社的砂礓桥闸，三面可通行载重汽车和拖拉机。工程技术人员和来参观的苏联专家都认为质量很好。
    用砂礓建闸，是阜阳县的下放干部魏成友带领阜光十社的社员创造的办法。他们用砂礓、石灰、胶泥造成一座长八点五公尺，孔径宽一点六公尺，深二公尺的砂礓闸。他们用大砂礓块砌闸拱，小砂礓混合胶泥填孔，石灰抹缝，只用了七百多个劳动日，五十二元资金就建成了。如用砖和水泥建闸，则需九万块砖，四万斤水泥，及其他材料，需投资一万六千元。
    砂礓在淮北到处都有，用它代替砖头和石头来进行建筑，是就地取材，废物利用。现在淮北水利工程中，每个地方都有成千上万个涵闸利用沙礓来建筑，大大加快了水利工程的进度。　（于明）
