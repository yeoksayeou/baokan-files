    Yunnan Provincial Party Committee Holds Grand Lectures for Leading Cadres to Learn Skills
    Learn Technology, Attack Science, and Wage War Against Nature

    (Our dispatch from Kunming, March 23) The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is using the method of grand lectures to help leading cadres systematically study scientific and technological knowledge, with very good results.

    For a long time, many leading cadres in Yunnan Province have had the desire to learn science and technology. Combining this with their own work, some are delving into mechanical dynamics, some are attacking philosophy and literary theory, and some are studying the development history of ethnic minorities. In order to help leading cadres systematically learn science and technology in a planned way and adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee successively invited Professor Fang Guoyu of the History Department of Yunnan University, Associate Professor Luo Guangxing and Lecturer Fang Chuping of the Agronomy Department, and Yang Dalin, chief engineer of the Provincial Industrial Department's Experimental Institute, to lecture on a general history of Yunnan, the development history of Southeast Asian ethnic groups, soil science, the effects of various chemical fertilizers on crops, and farmyard manure.

    The leading cadres who attended the lectures generally had rich practical work experience and had read the designated reference books in advance, so they accepted the information quickly. Comrade Fang Chuping, who was responsible for lecturing on farmyard manure, said: Before the lectures, they first pointed out to me that I should face Yunnan and combine theory with practice. This allowed me to omit many general things and briefly introduce the principles of fertilization, then focus on the key issues of each type of farmyard manure. He said: It would take dozens of hours to explain these contents to university students, but it only took three and a half hours to explain them to the Provincial Party Committee comrades. At the same time, they raised many important questions, such as: Is it suitable for Yunnan to use pig manure to improve red soil, as is done in Jiangxi? What are the benefits? How to solve the temperature problem of paddy fields in high-altitude mountainous areas, and so on. Comrade Luo Guangxing, who was responsible for lecturing on soil science, said: Because they have a very high political level, their ability to accept science and technology is very strong. For example, regarding the fertility of Yunnan's soil, it was previously believed that red soil contains less rapidly available fertilizer and is barren soil; the new Soviet theory is that the soil is fertile if the ratio of water and air is appropriate for plant growth, otherwise it is barren; moreover, each type of soil has its own characteristics, and one cannot simply use soybeans and sorghum as standards, which is the comprehensive and dialectical view. These issues need to be explained repeatedly to students, but the leading comrades of the Provincial Party Committee understand them as soon as they are mentioned. They also said: "Many soil experts come to Yunnan and shake their heads as soon as they see the red soil, which makes people feel discouraged. Now that you say it this way, we understand."

    Comrade Yang Dalin, who was responsible for lecturing on chemical fertilizers, initially feared that they would not understand because it was their first time dealing with chemical fertilizers, so he first explained the various elements of plant growth, then the effects of various chemical fertilizers on plants, and then focused on the position of synthetic ammonia in the manufacture of chemical fertilizers and the equipment and raw materials for manufacturing synthetic ammonia. However, many comrades put forward new insights on some technical issues. Comrade Yang said happily: "These leading comrades have a great spirit of inquiry! It can be believed that it will not be long before they become both red and expert politicians."

    Not long ago, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee held a special discussion on the issue of leading cadres learning technology. They affirmed this form of grand lectures, believing that it can enable leading cadres to master some necessary basic scientific knowledge in a relatively short period of time, and decided to make this learning method regular, with at least one class per week, each lasting no less than two hours. Now, the General Office and Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee are formulating a comprehensive plan for inviting professors and experts to lecture on natural science, science and technology, and other basic scientific knowledge, according to the requirements of the responsible comrades of various departments.

### 云南省委开讲大课领导干部学本领  学技术攻科学向自然界开战

    云南省委开讲大课领导干部学本领
    学技术攻科学向自然界开战
    本报昆明23日电　中共云南省委员会运用讲大课的方式，帮助领导干部有系统地学习科学技术知识，效果很好。
    云南省的许多领导干部，很久以来就有学习科学技术的要求。他们结合着本身的工作，有的在钻研机械动力学，有的在攻哲学和文艺理论，有的在研究少数民族发展史。云南省委为了帮助领导干部有计划有系统地学习科学技术，以适应工农业生产大跃进的新形势，先后邀请了云南大学历史系教授方国瑜、农学系副教授罗光兴、讲师方础平及省工业厅试验所主任工程师杨大林等，讲授了云南历史概略、东南亚民族发展史、土壤学、各种化肥对农作物的功效和农家肥料等课程。
    听课的领导干部一般都有较丰富的实际工作经验，事先又阅读了指定的参考书，所以接受得很快。负责讲农家肥料的方础平同志说：在讲课之前，他们先给我指出要面对云南、结合实际，这就使我可以省去许多一般的东西，扼要地介绍了施肥原则后，再就每一种农家肥料抓住关键问题一讲就行了。他说：这些内容对大学生几十个钟头也讲不完，对省委的同志只用三个半钟头就讲完了。同时他们还提出许多很重要的问题，如：江西用猪粪改良红壤，云南是否也适合？好处在哪里？高寒山区水田的温度问题怎样解决，等等。负责讲土壤的罗光兴同志说：由于他们有很高的政治水平，对科学技术的接受能力是很强的。如对云南土壤肥瘦的问题，过去都认为红壤含速效肥少，是瘦土；苏联新的理论是：土壤所含的水分和空气比例适当，植物生长好，就肥，不然就瘦；而且各种土壤都有自己的特性，不能光拿大豆、高粱作标准，这才是全面的辩证的。这些问题需要对学生翻来复去地讲，对省委的领导同志一提就明白。他们还说：“不少土壤专家来云南，一看到红土就摇头，弄得人都有些不带劲了，现在这么一说就明白了。”
    负责讲化肥的杨大林同志，起初怕他们初次接触化肥听不懂，先从植物生长的各种要素讲起，再讲各种化肥对植物的作用，再着重讲合成氨在制造化肥中的地位及制造合成氨的设备、原料等等。然而有很多同志对一些技术性的问题却提出了新的见解。杨同志很高兴地说：“这些领导同志钻劲真大！可以相信，不要多长时间，他们就会成为又红又专的政治家。”
    不久前，省委常委会对领导干部学习技术的问题作了一次专门的讨论。他们肯定了这种讲大课的形式，认为这样可以使领导干部在较短的时间内掌握一些必需的基础科学知识，决定把这种学习方法经常化，每周至少上课一次，每次不少于两小时。现在，省委办公厅和宣传部正在根据各部门负责同志的要求，制订请教授、专家讲授自然科学、科学技术及其它科学基础知识的全面规划。
