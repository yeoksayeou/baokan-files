    New Plans of an Old Model Worker
    Completing Five Years of Work in Four Months
    (Our Dispatch) At the recent Chongqing City 1957 Advanced Producer Representative Conference, Liao Shigang, a milling worker from Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, proposed a heroic plan: to guarantee the completion of five years of work in four and a half months. However, he was not satisfied and overturned his own plan the next day, proposing to complete five years of work in four months.
    Liao Shigang based his proposal of completing five years of work in four and a half months on the fact that he is currently making precision parts for sewing machines - feed dogs. Making feed dogs involves eight processes, and Liao Shigang is doing the sixth process. He proposed to change single-piece processing into joint large-piece processing, starting from the first process, shortening the work that originally took five times to complete into one go, increasing the efficiency of the first three processes by five times. The remaining five processes were originally done by five people separately, but after the previous improvement, he alone could take over all the work of the five people. In this way, he can not only replace four people, but also increase efficiency by more than double to five times in each process. As a result, he increased from the original 480 pieces per day to 10,800 pieces (including five processes), with a total efficiency increase of 27 times, equivalent to completing thirteen days of work in one day. During the Second Five-Year Plan, there are a total of 1,530 working days. Calculating on the basis of 25.5 working days per month, Liao Shigang will be able to accurately complete five years of work in four and a half months.
    The day after the meeting, after careful consideration, Liao Shigang believed that the time to complete five years of work could be further shortened, to only four months. The method is: one person manages one more machine tool, increasing from the original plan of managing four machines to managing five machines; adding two processes, changing from the original plan of one person taking care of five processes to taking care of seven processes. In this way, the amount of work completed in one day will increase from the original plan of thirteen days to fifteen days, and combined, five years of work can be completed in four months.
    Liao Shigang is an excellent young milling worker. He only left the countryside and entered the factory in August 1953. In the second year, he improved operations and created the advanced experience of one person managing eight machine tools, completing the First Five-Year Plan two years and four months ahead of schedule. In 1956, he created the rapid tool change method, shortening the tool change time from fifteen minutes to one minute and twenty seconds. Last year, he suggested using a press instead of a milling machine, combining five processes into one, increasing the daily output by 72 times. He has also made great achievements in ensuring quality and saving resources. Since 1954, he has been rated as a labor model or advanced producer every year, and has attended the city, provincial, and national advanced producer representative conferences.

### 老模范的新打算  四个月完成五年工作量

    老模范的新打算
    四个月完成五年工作量
    本报讯　在最近举行的重庆市1957年度先进生产者代表会上，重庆建设机床厂铣工廖世刚提出了一个英雄的计划：保证四个半月完成五年的工作量。但是，他毫不满足，第二天自己又推翻了这个计划，提出要四个月完成五年工作量。
    廖世刚提出四个半月完成五年工作量的根据是：目前他在做缝纫机的精密部件——送布齿。做送布齿共八道工序，廖世刚是做第六道工序的。他提议从第一道工序起，把单件加工改为联合大件加工，将五次才能做好的事缩短成一次干完，将前三道的工序工效提高了五倍。其余五道工序原来由五个人分别来做，但经过前面的改进后，他一个人就可把五个人的活全部包下来。这样一来，他不仅一人能代替四人干活，而且在每个工序上都提高了一倍多到五倍的效率。于是，他从原来一天做四百八十件活增加到一万零八百件（包括五道工序），工效总共提高二十七倍，等于一天做完十三天的事。第二个五年计划期间共一千五百三十个工作日，每月按二十五点五个工作日计算，廖世刚就能准确地用四个半月时间完成五年的工作量。
    会议第二天，廖世刚经过深思以后，认为完成五年工作量的时间还可以再缩短，只要四个月就行了。办法是：一个人再多管一台机床，由原计划管四台提高到管五台；增加两道工序，由原计划一人包五道工序，改为包七道工序。这样，就由原计划一天完成十三天的工作量，增加到一天完成十五天的工作量，合起来，四个月就能完成五年的工作量。
    廖世刚是个优秀的青年铣工。1953年8月，他才离开农村走进工厂。第二年就改进操作，创造了一个人管理八台机床的先进经验，提前两年零四个月完成了第一个五年计划。1956年，他创造了快速换刀法，由十五分钟换一次刀，缩短为一分二十秒。去年，他又建议用压力机代替铣床操作，把五道工序并为一道，使日产量提高七十二倍。在保证质量和节约方面，他做出的成绩也很大。从1954年起，他就连年被评为劳动模范或先进生产者，先后出席过市、省和全国的先进生产者代表会议。
