Launch a Massive Attack on the Four Pests
By a commentator from this newspaper

The nationwide patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests, launched last winter, has achieved tremendous success. Large numbers of the four pests have been eliminated in various regions, resulting in sixty "four-pest-free" counties (cities) and tens of thousands of "four-pest-free" units and areas. The masses have received profound education during the campaign, shattered various superstitious and conservative ideas that the four pests could not be eliminated, and are full of enthusiasm. At the recent national conference on eliminating the four pests and eradicating diseases, representatives from various provinces (cities) launched a competition between provinces (cities), putting forward the resounding slogan of "striving to become a four-pest-free country as soon as possible." It is certain that a new high tide of the patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests will soon be launched across the country.

Currently, this new situation on the front of eliminating the four pests is very favorable for the further development of the campaign. Under this situation, how leaders at all levels, on the basis of last winter's campaign, can fully utilize the favorable conditions in all aspects, further arouse the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and launch a large-scale advance on the four pests for a year of hard work is the fundamental guarantee for winning a decisive victory on the front of eliminating the four pests this year and eradicating the four pests as soon as possible.

At present, the struggle against the four pests in various regions generally adopts two different methods. One method is to unify command within a township, town, county, city, or even a larger area, mobilize the broad masses to act in coordination, and take various effective measures according to the season, the breeding of the four pests, and their activity patterns, to launch a large-scale attack on the four pests, one battle after another, a large battle combined with small battles, a comprehensive encirclement combined with repeated sweeps, and a major offensive followed by persistent routine work until they are annihilated. This is a method of quick battle and quick resolution. The other method is to focus on guarding small pilot areas, only making general task arrangements for general units, without unified command, and without organizing cooperation between units and between regions, allowing everyone to launch small-scale attacks on the four pests separately. One place moves while another doesn't, the sparrows fly away, and the rats move their homes. This is a method of slow battle and slow resolution. From the current situation, only the first method can meet the requirements of the entire campaign.

The faster and more proactive people are in fighting the four pests, the more advantageous it is. The four pests are living things with a high rate of reproduction. We must eliminate the four pests and their breeding conditions in large areas to truly be effective. For example, with flies, even if we eliminate them all, they will grow like spring grass again in certain seasons if we don't eradicate their breeding conditions. If one fly pupa is missed, it will reproduce 23.8 billion flies in a year. To defeat the four pests and eliminate them, we must calculate two accounts: one account of the battle results and one account of their breeding and reproduction. After calculating these two accounts, we will come to the conclusion that only when the battle results exceed the number of four pests' reproduction can we truly see the effect. To completely eliminate them, only a "large-scale attack" can solve the problem. A "small-scale attack" goes back and forth, is not thorough, and ultimately requires a large-scale attack.

From the current development trend of the campaign, it is also necessary to adopt the method of quick battle and quick resolution with a large-scale attack on the four pests. At present, the masses in various regions have been widely mobilized. They have mastered the habits of the four pests and created many ways to eliminate them. Many "four-pest-free" points have expanded to areas and large areas. In Anhui, Sichuan, and other places, methods have been created from a township (town), county (city), special district, and even a province-wide scope, mobilizing thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even tens of millions of people to act in coordination, conducting large-scale encirclements and sweeps of rats and sparrows, leaving sparrows with no way to fly into the sky and rats with no way to burrow into the ground. In Beijing, there are already methods to mobilize a large number of people throughout the city to eliminate mosquito and fly breeding conditions, making mosquitoes and flies extinct. Due to different conditions in various regions, the time to eliminate the four pests will certainly vary slightly, but it is certain that a large-scale advance on the four pests, quick battle and quick resolution, with a large area acting together, can greatly shorten the time. What Anhui and Sichuan can do, why can't other places do it?

Various difficulties will be encountered in the process of eliminating the four pests in various regions. But the problem is not whether there are difficulties, but what attitude should be taken to deal with them. The relationship between eliminating the four pests and production is an almost insurmountable problem in the eyes of those with conservative ideas. They take a passive and evasive attitude, and of course they will not find any solutions. However, those who are actively moving forward not only see the same problem, but more importantly, proceed from the demands of the masses and take an active attitude to overcome difficulties. They mobilize the masses to discuss and research, and once the masses are mobilized, solutions are found, and unimaginable good solutions are obtained. For example, farmers in Jiangsu have created experience in this regard. They circulate a folk song: "Get up early and sweep diligently; Combine production with accumulating fertilizer during the day, Attend people's schools at night, Catch sparrows on the way home; Set up rat traps before going to sleep; All for the 'Forty Articles'." Eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene is ultimately to improve people's health and promote the development of production. There are no fundamental contradictions between them. The question is only how to arrange it. Now that the spring plowing season has arrived, the countryside is busy with production, greening, and literacy, and it is certainly difficult to be busy with a large-scale advance on the four pests. However, if the leaders in various regions truly attach importance to the struggle to eliminate the four pests, explain clearly to the masses that this year is the decisive year to eliminate the four pests, and mobilize the masses to discuss, they will still come up with various methods according to the time and place, and make comprehensive and appropriate arrangements for the time and labor force of various tasks, so as to ensure that the advance on the four pests is not stopped and that the great leap forward in production is not affected.

Regarding the issue of technical guidance, Sichuan actively and proactively came up with a solution, concentrating many experts in eliminating the four pests from the entire province, summarizing more than 150 methods for eliminating the four pests, and promoting them to the broad masses, which solved the problem. In order to save medicine, Anhui Province adopted various measures in eliminating the four pests, which both eliminated the four pests and overcame the difficulties of insufficient allocation and supply of medicines and equipment. The emergence of these situations is unimaginable according to the logic of conservative ideas.

The experience of the previous period of the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests inspires us that a large-scale attack on the four pests, quick battle and quick resolution, and striving to eliminate the four pests as soon as possible is a great feat that meets the demands of the broad masses. As long as leaders at all levels firmly believe in the masses, fully estimate the strength of the masses, discuss and solve problems with the masses, and be vigilant and overcome various conservative ideas, they can further arouse the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and smoothly achieve the increasingly expanding victory in eliminating the four pests.

This year is a decisive year for the people of the whole country to completely eliminate the four pests in the whole country, a crucial year for the people of the whole country to conquer the most serious diseases that endanger people's health, and a year to launch a patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, driving the leap forward in all health work, and greatly improving the national health outlook. Leaders at all levels should continue to carry forward the achievements of last winter's campaign, sound the horn of a large-scale attack on the four pests, launch a new high tide of the campaign, and strive to make our country a four-pest-free country as soon as possible.

    向四害大举进攻
    本报评论员
    去年冬季展开的全民性的除四害爱国卫生运动，已获得了巨大的成绩。各地大量消灭了四害，出现了六十个四无县（市）和几万个四无单位和地区。广大群众在运动中受到了深刻的教育，打破了认为四害不能除、除不了等各种迷信保守思想，干劲十足。在最近一次的全国除四害、消灭疾病竞赛会议上，各省（市）代表又展开了省（市）之间的竞赛，提出了“争取提早成为四无国”的响亮口号。可以肯定，全国以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动的新高潮即将掀起。
      目前，除四害战线上的这一新的形势，对于运动的进一步开展是非常有利的。在这一形势下，各级领导上如何在去年冬季运动的基础上，充分利用各方面的有利条件，进一步鼓起广大人民群众的干劲，向四害大进军，大干一年，这是争取今年在除四害战线上取得决定性胜利，提早消灭四害的根本保证。
    现在各地对四害的斗争，大体上采取两种不同的办法，一种是在乡、镇、县、市或是更大的地区内，统一指挥，发动广大群众协同动作，按照季节、四害的繁殖及其活动的规律，采取各种有效措施，向四害大举进攻，一个战斗接着一个战斗、大战斗结合小战斗、全面围剿结合反复扫荡，大突击以后转入坚持经常的工作，直到把它们歼灭为止，这是速战速决的办法；另一种是偏重守住小的试点，对一般单位只是一般布置任务，没有统一指挥，也不组织单位与单位、地区与地区之间的协作，让大家分头地去向四害小举进攻，这里动那里不动，麻雀飞走了，老鼠搬了家，这是慢战慢决的办法。从现在的情况看，只有采取第一种办法才能适应整个运动的要求。
    人们对四害作战，越快、越主动就越有利。四害是有生命的东西，繁殖率很高。我们必须在大片大片的地区内消灭四害及其孳生条件，才能真正奏效。如苍蝇，人们就是把它全部歼灭了，由于没有铲除它的孳生条件，到一定的季节，又会像春草那样生长起来。如漏挖一个蝇蛹，一年就会繁殖二百三十八亿只苍蝇。要战胜四害，消灭四害，必须算两笔账，既要算战果的一笔账，也要算它们孳生和繁殖的一笔账。算了这两笔账，就会得出这样的结论：只有战果超过四害繁殖的数字，才能真正看出成效。而要彻底消灭它们，只有“大举进攻”才能解决问题，“小举进攻”攻来攻去，搞不彻底，最后还得大举进攻。
    从当前运动发展的趋势来看，也必须采取向四害大举进攻的速战速决的办法。目前，各地群众都已普遍发动起来了，他们掌握了四害的习性，创造了许多消灭四害的办法，很多“四无”点已扩展到面和大片。在安徽、四川等地，已经创造出从一个乡（镇）、县（市）、专区直到全省地区范围内，从动员几千人几万人几百万人直至几千万人协同动作，大规模围歼和扫荡鼠雀的办法，使麻雀上天无路，老鼠入地无门；在北京市已经有在全市范围内，动员大量人力消灭蚊蝇孳生条件的办法，使蚊蝇断子绝孙。由于各地的条件不同，消灭四害的时间当然略有长短，但是可以肯定：向四害大进军，速战速决，一大片一大片的一起动手，可以大大缩短时间。安徽和四川等地所能办到的事，别的地方为什么办不到呢？
    各地在除四害的过程中，都会遇到各种困难。但是问题不在于有无困难，而在于应该采取什么态度来对待它。除四害和生产互相结合的关系，这在有保守思想的人看来是几乎不能解决的问题，他们采取消极回避的态度，当然是不会寻找出什么办法来的。但是积极前进的人，不仅看到了同样的问题，更重要的是从群众的要求出发，采取积极克服困难的态度，发动群众讨论研究，一发动群众，就得出了办法，并且得到了想像不到的好办法。如江苏的农民在这方面就创造了经验，他们流传着一首歌谣：一早起勤打扫；白天结合生产积肥料，晚上上民校，回家路上掏麻雀；支好捕鼠夹子才睡觉；总的为了“四十条”。除四害、讲卫生，归根到底是为了增进人民的健康，促进生产的发展，它们并不存在什么根本性的矛盾。问题只是在于如何安排。现在春耕的时节已经到来，农村忙生产、忙绿化、忙扫盲，再要忙向四害大进军，工作中的困难当然是很多的。但是如果各地领导上真正把除四害的斗争重视起来，向群众说清楚今年是消灭四害的决定性的一年，并发动群众讨论，他们仍然会因时因地地想出各种办法，把各项工作的时间以及劳动力等作全面而恰当的安排，就能保证既不停止向四害的进军，又不影响生产的大跃进。
  　对于技术指导问题，四川积极主动地想出了办法，把全省许多除四害能手集中起来，总结出一百五十多种消灭四害的办法，并把它向广大群众推广，这就解决了问题。安徽省为了节省用药，在除四害中采取了各种措施，既消灭了四害，又克服了药械调拨供应不足的困难。这些情况的出现，按照保守思想的逻辑是无法想像得到的。
    前一时期除四害爱国卫生运动的经验启发我们，向四害大举进攻，速战速决，争取尽早地消灭四害，这是符合广大群众要求的壮举，各级领导上只要坚决地相信群众，充分估计群众的力量，有问题和群众讨论解决，并警惕和克服各种保守思想，进一步鼓起群众的革命干劲，就可以顺利地取得除四害的日益扩大的胜利。
    今年是全国人民在全国范围内全歼四害的决定性的一年，是全国人民征服各种危害人民健康最严重疾病最关紧要的一年，也是开展以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动，带动一切卫生工作跃进，大大改进全国卫生面貌的一年。各级领导应当再接再厉地发扬去年冬季运动的成绩，吹起向四害大举进攻的号角，掀起运动新的高潮，争取我们的国家尽早地成为四无国。
