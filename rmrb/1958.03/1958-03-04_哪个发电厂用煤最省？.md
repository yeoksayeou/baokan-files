    Which Power Plant Uses the Least Coal?
    During the First Five-Year Plan period, the coal consumption of national state-owned thermal power plants significantly decreased. In 1957, the actual coal consumption per kilowatt-hour was reduced to 0.555 kg of standard coal, a 16% decrease compared to 1952 and a 6% decrease compared to the 1957 coal consumption target set by the First Five-Year Plan. However, considering the overall situation of national state-owned thermal power plants, there is still great potential for reducing coal consumption. Currently, only eighteen plants nationwide have a coal consumption rate below 0.555 kg per kilowatt-hour; twenty-two plants consume 0.8 kg or more per kilowatt-hour, and five plants exceed 1 kg. The coal consumption of some thermal power plants with basically the same equipment varies greatly. For example, the coal consumption of high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power plants ranges from 0.37 kg to 0.664 kg per kilowatt-hour. For medium-pressure power plants, it ranges from 0.468 kg to 0.852 kg, and for medium-low-pressure power plants, it ranges from 0.643 kg to 1.864 kg. According to the calculation of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, if plants with the same equipment can learn from the experience of advanced plants and strive to tap potential, and each plant reaches the advanced indicators of 1957, the national average coal consumption per kilowatt-hour can be reduced by another 0.015 kg, saving 300,000 tons of coal annually.

    The coal consumption of various thermal power plants with the same equipment conditions in 1957 is compared as follows: (Attached chart)
    Note: Xiaguan Power Plant is in Nanjing, Yangshupu and Zhabei Power Plants are in Shanghai, Xiahuayuan Power Plant is in Xuanhua, and Xicun Power Plant is in Guangzhou.

### 哪个发电厂用煤最省？

    哪个发电厂用煤最省？
    在第一个五年计划期间，全国国营火力发电厂的煤耗有了显著降低。1957年每发一度电实际的煤耗降低到标准煤0.555公斤，比1952年降低了16％，比第一个五年计划规定1957年的煤耗指标降低了6％。但从全国国营火力发电厂总的情况来看，降低煤耗还有很大的潜力。现在全国国营火力发电厂煤耗每度在0.555公斤以下的，只有十八个厂；每度在0.8公斤以上的有二十二个厂，超过一公斤的有五个厂。有些设备基本相同的火力发电厂煤耗相差很大，如高温高压热电厂煤耗每度在0.37公斤到0.664公斤之间。中压电厂在0.468公斤到0.852公斤之间，中低压电厂在0.643公斤至1.864公斤之间。根据电力工业部的核算，如果设备相同的厂能够学习先进厂的经验，努力挖掘潜在力，每个厂都达到1957年的先进指标，就可以使全国每度电的平均煤耗指标再降低0.015公斤，全年可以节约三十万吨煤。（达古）
    现在把1957年各种同样设备条件的火力发电厂煤耗情况比较如下表：（附图表）
    注：下关发电厂在南京，杨树浦和闸北两个发电厂在上海，下花园发电厂在宣化，西村发电厂在广州。
