Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 1st. The wish to use low-grade fuels such as corn cobs, cotton stalks, and bean pods to power internal combustion engines is beginning to be realized by the Tianjin Second Mechanical Industry Company. In the past ten days or so, the company's employees have successfully started an eleven-horsepower automobile engine and an eight-horsepower gas engine using low-grade fuels such as corn cobs. The engines ran normally, started quickly, and the combustion point was similar to that of gasoline.

This experiment is of great significance for improving the fuel supply for agricultural power machinery in our country. Using corn cobs, cotton stalks, etc., as fuel is not only cheaper than coal and wood, but also makes it easier for rural areas to obtain materials locally.

    玉米芯、棉杆、豆荚开动内燃机
    新华社天津1日电　用玉米芯、棉花秆、豆荚等低级燃料来开动内燃机的愿望，开始由天津第二机械工业公司实现了。在最近十多天内，这个公司的职工用玉米芯等低级燃料，连续发动了十一匹马力的汽车引擎和八匹马力的煤气机，运行正常，机器起动迅速，燃烧点也和用汽油差不多。
    这项试验对改善我国农业动力机械的燃料供应有重要意义。玉米芯、棉花秆等作为燃料，比起煤炭、木材来，不仅价格低廉，也便于农村就地取材。
