Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th: The people of Korea are enthusiastically preparing to welcome the first group of returning Chinese People's Volunteers.

The larger stations from Pyongyang to Sinuiju have been newly decorated. On the platforms, Chinese and Korean national flags and huge portraits of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong are hung, and rest shelters and tea stations have been set up. Slogans erected next to the stations are written in Korean and Chinese: "Salute to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers who fought for peace!" "The friendship between the Korean and Chinese people cemented in blood will last forever!" Korean people in various places are repairing bridges and roads day and night for the Volunteer Army units withdrawing from Korea. Members of the Women's Alliance in a certain county are working day and night to rush-produce "farewell bags" and other souvenirs for the Volunteer Army soldiers. Students in the painting group of a certain Korean middle school collectively created an oil painting of a peace dove, preparing to give it to the returning Volunteer Army. They said that this oil painting represents that the Volunteer Army came for peace, and today they are leaving for peace again.

In recent days, Korean residents in the areas where the Volunteer Army is stationed have continuously visited the Volunteer Army units. Many families have made rice cakes and rice wine, and have also taken out apples and honey from their cellars, inviting Volunteer Army officers and soldiers to their homes as guests. Residents of various counties and villages have widely held get-togethers and forums with the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers stationed there, saying farewell all night long. Many Korean farmers tied red and green ribbons and colored silk on the heads of their oxen, preparing to send backpacks to the Volunteer Army. Some young women and old women ran to the Volunteer Army barracks to help Volunteer Army officers and soldiers wash clothes, take apart quilts, and mend shoes and socks. They said that they want to dress up the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers beautifully, so that they can return to their motherland and reunite with their relatives. Korean residents in a certain village, who had a bumper harvest thanks to the water conservancy projects built with the help of the Volunteer Army, prepared to present each household with a large red flower for the Volunteer Army, and each person wrote a thank-you letter to the Volunteer Army. Bai Da-xie, a sixty-two-year-old man from a certain village, wrote in Chinese on a silk farewell letter: "The Ai Mountain River is long and long, the Volunteer Army's kindness will never be forgotten, your glorious deeds will coexist with the Ai Mountain River."

People from all over Korea have also prepared many gifts to send to the returning Volunteer Army units, including bronze bowls, boat-shaped rubber shoes, ginseng, and flower vases made of artillery shells.

    装饰车站　通宵话别　赶制礼品
    朝鲜人民热烈准备欢送志愿军
    新华社平壤10日电　朝鲜各地人民热烈准备欢送中国人民志愿军首批归国部队。
    从平壤到新义州较大的车站上都装饰一新。月台上，挂着中朝两国国旗和金日成首相、毛泽东主席的巨幅画像，月台上设立了休息棚和茶水站。车站旁边竖立的标语台上用朝文和中文写着：“向为和平而战的英雄的中国人民志愿军致敬！”“朝中两国人民鲜血凝结成的友谊万年长存！”各地朝鲜人民为志愿军撤离朝鲜的部队整日地修桥补路。某郡女性同盟盟员们夜以继日地为志愿军战士赶制“送别袋”等，以作纪念品。朝鲜某中学绘画组的学生，集体创造了一幅和平鸽子油画，准备送给归国的志愿军。他们说，这幅油画表示着志愿军是为和平而来，今天又为和平而去。
    近几天来，志愿军驻地的朝鲜居民不断到志愿军部队看望。许多人家做了年糕、米酒，还拿出地窖里的苹果和蜂蜜，邀请志愿军官兵到他们家里作客。各郡、各里的居民广泛地和驻地志愿军官兵举行了联欢会和座谈会，通宵达旦地话别。许多朝鲜农民在黄牛头上结上红绿布带和彩绸，准备为志愿军送背包。有些年青妇女和老大娘跑到志愿军营房里帮助志愿军官兵们洗衣服，拆被子、补鞋袜。她们说，要把志愿军官兵打扮得漂漂亮亮，好回祖国和亲人团聚。曾由志愿军帮助兴修水利而获得丰收的某里朝鲜居民，准备每户为志愿军献一朵大红花，每人给志愿军写一封感谢信。某里六十二岁的白大爕用中文在丝绸做的送别信上写着：“艾山江水长又长，志愿军的恩情永不忘，你们的光荣事迹，将与艾山江并存。”
    朝鲜各地人民还把许多礼品准备送给归国的志愿军部队，其中有铜碗、船形胶鞋、人参和炮弹壳做的花瓶等。
