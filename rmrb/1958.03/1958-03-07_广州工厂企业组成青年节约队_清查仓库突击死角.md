Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 6th: The anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement in Guangzhou's factories and enterprises is developing towards a climax. After mobilization in various factories and enterprises around the Spring Festival, workers throughout the city posted hundreds of thousands of big-character posters in a very short period of time.

	At the same time, workers from nearly one hundred factories in the city collected materials and held anti-waste exhibitions; young workers from more than thirty factories voluntarily organized youth thrift teams to inspect warehouses and tackle dead corners. As of February 28th, a total of 474 factories, 625 handicraft cooperatives, and 138 commercial management departments, wholesale departments, and some of their affiliated stores in the city (excluding suburban areas) had joined the movement.

	In the past ten days or so, workers in various factories and enterprises have exposed a large number of wasteful phenomena. Workers at the Sino-Western Instrument Factory revealed that the factory's blind procurement of raw materials had resulted in a serious backlog of funds. The backlog of ceramic heating element regulating plates alone is enough to meet the needs of the entire Second Five-Year Plan period. The Third Leather Shoe Handicraft Cooperative often discards large amounts of iron nails on the ground, estimated to waste more than 1,800 yuan a year. The Hongmian Printing House's total output value in 1957 was only over 310,000 yuan, but the losses caused by defective and substandard products amounted to 67,200 yuan. The glucose produced by the Guangdong Pharmaceutical Factory was returned due to poor quality, requiring ten trucks to transport it all.

	Due to the bold and in-depth exposure of waste by the broad masses of workers, not only was the waste of some enterprises exposed, but it also greatly shocked some enterprise leaders, who quickly corrected their complacency and expressed their determination to work with the workers to strive for a complete victory in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement.

    广州工厂企业组成青年节约队
    清查仓库突击死角
    新华社广州6日电　广州市工厂企业的反浪费反保守运动正在向高潮发展。春节前后各工厂企业进行动员以后，在很短的时间内全市职工就贴出了几十万张大字报。
    同时，全市还有近一百家工厂的职工，自己收集材料举办了反浪费展览会；有三十多家工厂的青年工人，自动组织了青年节约队，清查仓库，突击死角。到2月28日止，全市卷入运动的单位（不包括郊区）已有四百七十四个工厂，六百二十五个手工业合作社，和一百三十八个商业管理部、批发部及其所属的部分商店。
    十多天来，各个工厂企业的职工，已经揭发出了大量的浪费现象。中西仪器厂的职工揭发这个工厂因盲目购进原材料而积压资金的情况很严重，光是积压的电热器瓷调节板就够第二个五年计划期间应用。第三皮鞋手工业社经常把大量铁钉废弃地上，估计一年就浪费一千八百多元。红棉印花社1957年总产值不过三十一万多元，但因废次品而造成的损失竟达六万七千二百元。广东制药厂生产的葡萄糖因质量不好而退回的产品，要用十卡车才能载完。
    由于广大职工大胆深入地揭发浪费，不但揭露出了一些企业的浪费，同时也使一些企业领导人大吃一惊，迅速纠正了自己的自满情绪，表示决心同职工一道争取反浪费反保守运动的全胜。
