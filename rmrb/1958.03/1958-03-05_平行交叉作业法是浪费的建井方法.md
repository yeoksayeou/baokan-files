    Parallel and Intersecting Operations are a Wasteful Method of Mine Construction
    Zhu Renjun
    The coal industry experienced tremendous development during the First Five-Year Plan period, with achievements being the primary aspect. However, some waste due to lack of experience was unavoidable. My purpose in reflecting the following situation is to hope that the leaders of the Ministry of Coal Industry will better learn from these lessons, correct shortcomings, avoid waste, and promote greater development of the coal industry.
    The Ministry of Coal Industry's adoption of "parallel and intersecting operations of exploration, design, and construction" in mine construction has resulted in significant waste.
    Firstly, it prolongs the construction period of the mine. The reason for adopting parallel and intersecting operations is to strive for an early start to construction, in order to put the mine into production sooner. However, because this method violates basic construction procedures – designing without sufficient geological data and constructing without a complete design plan – an early start to construction has been achieved, but an early start to production has not; not only has it not been achieved, but it has also delayed the time of putting the mine into production, resulting in more losses than gains.
    Taking the Fuxin Ping'an vertical shaft, which adopted parallel and intersecting operations, as an example, the actual construction period was sixty months. During the First Five-Year Plan, constructing such a modern large-scale mine in just sixty months should be considered very advanced. However, at the same time, we must see that there is still great potential. For example, under the premise of complying with basic construction procedures, if the inclined shaft can be used in advance to develop ventilation levels, the construction period can be shortened by about twelve months; if the ventilation system can be arranged reasonably, avoiding the impact of the ventilation layout on the connection of various processes, the construction period can be shortened by about six months; if the situation of stopping work waiting for construction drawings can be completely avoided, the construction period can be shortened by about two months; if ditches and other projects can be completed simultaneously during roadway excavation, the construction period can be shortened by about two months; adding a two-month safety factor, the actual construction period can be shortened by twenty months. In this way, the administrative management expenses and other costs saved are equivalent to one-quarter to one-third of the total construction and installation workload; if the total workload is 24 million yuan, then 6 million to 8 million yuan can be saved. Within these twenty months, according to the production level of the Ping'an vertical shaft, 1.2 million to 1.5 million tons of coal can be produced, which, at 10 yuan per ton, can create 12 million to 15 million yuan of wealth for the country.
    Second, because the design is done without sufficient geological data, the design plan cannot be sufficiently reasonable, resulting in serious waste during construction or after putting the mine into production.
    For example, the geological data on which the preliminary design of the Ping'an vertical shaft was based indicated that the recoverable reserves of coal were about 47 million tons, so the designed annual output of the mine was 1.2 million tons, and the mining life was 39 years. Later, the geological data supplemented during the technical design indicated that the recoverable reserves were about 140 million tons. If the annual output were 3 million tons, it could be mined for 46 years. In this way, the original design plan is unreasonable. However, because the shaft barrel was almost at the bottom at this time and the shaft mouth position could no longer be changed, it could only be changed to an annual output of 1.5 million tons, and the mining life is 93 years. This is the consequence of designing and constructing simultaneously.
    Third, the adoption of parallel and intersecting operations has led the leadership to focus only on starting construction early, while relaxing such an important link as geological work. The Ping'an vertical shaft, for example, only focused on starting construction early in June 1952, but neglected to provide geological data according to the time stipulated in the contract. Therefore, the technical design, which should have been submitted at the end of 1952, did not arrive at the site until March 1954, delaying the start of construction by thirty-six months, seriously affecting the time of handover to production, and causing the problem of an unreasonable shaft mouth position, preventing the annual output from reaching the required level.

    平行交叉作业法是浪费的建井方法
    朱人俊
    煤炭工业在第一个五年计划期间有巨大的发展，成绩是主要的，由于缺乏经验而造成某些浪费也是难免的。我反映下列情况的目的是希望煤炭工业部的领导同志更好地吸取教训，改正缺点，避免浪费，促使煤炭工业更大的发展。
    煤炭工业部在矿井建设方面采取“边勘探，边设计，边施工的平行交叉作业法”，造成很大的浪费。
    首先是延长了矿井建设的施工期限。采取平行交叉作业法的理由是争取提前开工，以便提前投入生产。然而，由于这一方法违背了基本建设程序，在没有足够的地质资料时就设计，在没有完全的设计方案时就施工，提前开工是作到了，提前投入生产就没有作到；不仅没有作到，还推迟了投入生产的时间，得不偿失。
    以采取平行交叉作业的阜新平安竖井来说，实际施工期六十个月。在第一个五年计划中，建设这样现代化的大型矿井，只花了六十个月的施工期，应该说是非常先进的。但同时我们必须看到其中还有很大的潜力。比如在遵守基本建设程序的前提下，如果能够提前利用斜井来开拓通风水平，还可缩短工期约十二个月；如果能够合理安排通风系统，避免因通风布置影响各个工序的连接，还可缩短工期约六个月；如果能完全避免停工等待施工图纸，还可缩短工期约两个月；如果在巷道掘进中，能同时完成水沟等工程，还可缩短工期约两个月；加上两个月的安全系数，比实际工期可缩短二十个月。这样，节省的行政管理费用和其他各项费用相当于全部建筑安装工作量的四分之一到三分之一；如果全部工作量是两千四百万元的话，就可节省六百万到八百万元。在这二十个月内，按平安竖井的生产水平，可生产出一百二十万吨到一百五十万吨煤，以每吨十元计，可为国家生产出一千二百万元到一千五百万元的财富。
    第二，由于还没有足够的地质资料就设计，设计方案就不能做到充分合理，在施工中或投入生产以后造成严重的浪费。
    例如，平安竖井初步设计所根据的地质资料，煤的可采埋藏量约四千七百万吨，因此井的设计年产量是一百二十万吨，开采年限是三十九年。后来技术设计时补充的地质资料可采埋藏量约一亿四千万吨。如果年产三百万吨的话，可以开采四十六年。这样原来的设计方案就不合理了。但因为这时井筒已经快到底了，井口位置已无法变更，因此只能改为年产量一百五十万吨，开采年限是九十三年。这就是边设计边施工所造成的后果。
    第三，采取平行交叉作业的方法，使领导上只重视提前开工，而放松了像地质工作这样一个十分重要的环节。像平安竖井只重视了在1952年6月提前开工，却忽视了按照合同规定的时间提供地质资料，因此应该在1952年底提出的技术设计，直到1954年3月才到达现场，使开工期推迟三十六个月，严重影响了移交生产的时间，而且发生了井口位置不合理的毛病，使年产量不能达到应有的水平。
