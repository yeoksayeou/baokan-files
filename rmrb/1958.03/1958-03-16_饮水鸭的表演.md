    The Drinking Bird's Performance
    Jing Li
    The drinking bird appears to be just a simple glass tube, yet it can give us a wonderful performance: dipping and rising, it pecks at the red ink in the glass in front of it.
    Why can this little duck, which is not controlled by anything, keep moving?
    The duck's head is wrapped in a layer of gauze, which is not just for painting the eyes and mouth to make it look like a duck; it has other wonderful uses.
    The duck's belly is not filled with ordinary red ink; it is filled with a liquid called chloromethane. Because this substance evaporates easily, the duck's body (including the head) is often filled with chloromethane gas. As long as we put the drinking bird's head into the cup at the beginning to wet the gauze wrapped around its head, then due to the evaporation of water, it constantly absorbs heat from the duck's head, which quickly turns the chloromethane gas in the duck's head into liquid. As the chloromethane gas in the head decreases, the air pressure in the head decreases accordingly, forming a pressure difference between the upper and lower parts, with the neck as the boundary: the lower part has high air pressure, and the upper part has low air pressure. Therefore, the liquid in the belly is pressed up, even rising to the head. It is precisely because of the upward movement of the liquid in the lower part that the original balance of the duck's body is changed, and the duck's body leans forward, so the action of drinking water downwards appears.
    The duck's drinking has two consequences: first, the duck's body tends to be horizontal and balanced, which makes the original gas parts of the upper and lower parts communicate, and the pressure difference suddenly disappears. At this time, the liquid flows back to the lower part due to gravity, so the duck's head rises again. Second, the re-immersion of the gauze on the head creates conditions for the second drinking.
    The process of liquefaction of chloromethane gas is an endothermic process, so there is energy consumption in the duck's drinking process, and this active consumption is the driving force that governs the drinking bird's actions.
    Due to the continuous consumption of chloromethane heat in the duck's body, the volatilized gas becomes less and less; the less gas, the more difficult the liquefaction caused by the evaporation of water. Then the pressure difference between the upper and lower parts caused by this liquefaction becomes smaller and smaller. When this pressure difference is too small to make the liquid pressed up change the original balance of the duck's body, our drinking bird will temporarily stop moving.
    The "drinking cessation phenomenon" of the drinking bird is temporary. Because the chloromethane in its belly can continuously absorb heat from the air, which causes its gas to continue to increase inside the duck. When this gas increases to a sufficient degree inside the duck, if the gauze on the duck's head is still very wet, then the drinking bird will start drinking again. But when the cup of water in front of it evaporates to the point where it can no longer "suck" it, or the liquid chloromethane is completely volatilized, it has to starve to death, so the drinking bird is not immortal.

    饮水鸭的表演
    晶粒
    饮水鸭，看起来只是一个简单的玻璃管，然而它能给我们作一个精彩的表演：一俯一仰地啄饮它面前玻璃杯里面的红墨水，
    这个没有任何东西操纵的小鸭，为什么能不停地动作呢？
    鸭的头上裹着一层纱布，它不只是为了涂画眼睛和嘴巴成为鸭形，它还有其它的妙用。
    鸭的肚里装的，并不是什么普通红墨水，它是一种称为氯甲烷的液体。由于这种东西很容易挥发，所以鸭的身体内（包括头部）经常充满着氯甲烷的气体。只要我们在开始时把饮水鸭的头按进杯里，使它头上裹着的纱布打湿，那末由于水的蒸发，不断地从鸭的头上吸收热量，就使鸭头部的氯甲烷气体很快的变为液体。头部的氯甲烷气体减少了，头部的气压就随之降低，因而形成以颈为界的上下两部分的气压差：下部气压高，上部气压低。肚里的液体因此就被压了上来，甚至升到头部。也正由于下部液体的上升，改变了鸭身原有的平衡，鸭身前倾，所以向下饮水的动作就出现了。
    鸭的饮水，又产生了两个后果：第一，鸭身的趋于横直平衡，就使原来上下两部的气体部分相通，气压差突然消失。这时液体又因重力的作用而流到下部，所以鸭的头又重新昂起来了。第二，头上纱布的重新浸水，就给第二次的饮水创造了条件。
    氯甲烷气体液化的过程正是一个放热过程，所以在鸭的饮水过程中是存在着能量的消耗的，这些能动的消耗，正是支配着饮水鸭行动的原动力。
    由于鸭体内氯甲烷热量的不断消耗，挥发出来的气体就越来越少；气体越少，因为水的蒸发而引起的液化也就越困难。那末由这种液化所引起的上下两部分的气压差就越来越小，当这种气压差小得不足以使压上去的液体改变鸭身原有的平衡时，我们的饮水鸭也就暂时不动了。
    饮水鸭的“绝饮现象”是暂时的。因为它肚里的氯甲烷能不断地从空气中吸收热量，而使它的气体在鸭内继续增加，当这种气体在鸭内增加到足够的程度时，假若鸭头上的纱布还很湿，那末饮水鸭又会重新开始饮水。但是当它面前的那杯水蒸发到它不能再饮“吸”到，或液体氯甲烷挥发完了的时候，它只得饿死了，所以饮水鸭并不是长生不老的。
