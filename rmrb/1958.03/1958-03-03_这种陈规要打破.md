    This Kind of Outdated Rule Should Be Broken
    Zhao Jing, Tiexi District, Shenyang City
    A worker in our factory, holding a dirty mask, went to the materials clerk to get a new one. The materials clerk, seeing that the mask could still be used after washing, said uneasily, "Isn't this still usable?" The worker then said: I'm replacing this for Little Liu. At this point, the materials clerk had no choice but to give him a new one.

    I watched from the side and thought about it. There are two aspects to this issue: first, the materials clerk felt uneasy, but still gave him a new mask because the factory has a system of changing masks once a month, so it should be given; second, this worker also firmly believes that he is acting according to the system and that it is his right. It seems that neither of them is wrong.

    In order to rationally use some labor protection equipment, such as masks, gloves, towels, etc., it is necessary to formulate some requisition systems. But the problem lies in the fact that some of our comrades simply understand "acting according to the system," but do not know that only a high degree of awareness of cherishing state property can make the implementation of the system achieve the ideal requirements. Knowingly being unreasonable, yet mechanically implementing it, is also a conservative approach, and this outdated rule should also be broken. And it should not be limited to receiving masks.

    这种陈规要打破
    沈阳市铁西区　赵敬
    我们厂的一个工人，拿着一个脏口罩，到材料员那儿去要换新的。材料员看这个口罩洗洗还能用，就不安地说：“这不是还能用吗？”这个工人就说：我这是替小刘换的。这一下，材料员便无可奈何地给他换了一个。
    我在一旁看着，想了想，这问题有两个方面：第一，材料员觉着心里不安，但仍给了他一个新口罩，是因为厂里有着一个月换一个口罩的制度，应该给；第二，这个工人也深信自己是按制度办事，是应该的。好像他们两方面都没错。
    为了合理使用一些劳动保护用品，如口罩、手套、毛巾等，制定一些领用制度是必要的。但问题在于我们一些同志，只是简单地理解“按制度办事”，却不知道，只有高度爱护国家财产的自觉性，才能使制度的执行，达到理想的要求。明知不够合理，仍然机械执行，这也是一种保守的作法，这陈规也应当打破。而且要不仅仅限于领口罩上面。
