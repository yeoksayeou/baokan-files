    Learning and Catching Up
    Tian Lianqian
    In order to quickly solve the problem of water lifting tools and ensure that the newly added tens of millions of mu of irrigated land this year can truly benefit, Hebei Province has loudly put forward the slogan of "Learn from Cangxian Prefecture, Catch up with Cangxian Prefecture." This is of great significance at present. In other regions, it is also necessary to put forward such specific action slogans to promote the solution of certain specific and urgent problems.
    When the people are urgently demanding certain new things (new tools), these new things will inevitably appear. However, the earliness or lateness of their appearance has an element of chance in specific regions. In capitalist society, because the interests of individuals and groups are inconsistent, although people always want to learn new things from others and catch up with others, others are always unwilling to let others learn their new things (which are their trump cards). Time can eventually conquer all secrets, turning the new into the universal; but this time requires a very long period, even dragging on for many years or even an entire century. Socialism has incomparable superiority here. Because the interests of all regions are completely一致(yīzhì consistent), the new things produced in one region can be推广(tuīguǎng promote) and applied to vast areas in a very short time. The backward regions that apply the experience of others will often surpass their teachers, and by learning from others, they will catch up with and surpass others, becoming advanced regions, and prompting others to further learn new things and catch up with new things. In this way, the speed of progress is beyond the reach of capitalism.
    Learning from each other and catching up with each other is a law of historical development. The socialist law has a more important feature, which is organized and led mutual learning and mutual catching up. Because now the government is also the people's own, completely in line with the people's interests, it can organize and lead this mass movement of mutual learning and catching up, so that it can develop forward at many times the speed. Therefore, on the one hand, people should regard mutual learning and mutual catching up as a manifestation of the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people, and as a reflection of the masses' vigorous upward and surging forward; on the other hand, they can also regard this as a leadership method and leadership responsibility. All leading cadres should go out of the office, go to the masses, and pay attention to discovering new creations among the masses at any time. At the same time, we must organize everyone to learn from each other and catch up with each other in a timely manner. This leadership method has become unprecedentedly popular since last winter, and all regions should universally adopt it without exception to accelerate the historical process. Know that history is now in our hands.

    学和赶
    田连阡
    河北省为了迅速解决提水工具问题，使今年新增加的几千万亩水浇地今年都能切实受益，响亮地提出了“学沧县专区、赶沧县专区”的口号。这在当前是有重大意义的。在别的地区，也需要提出这样具体的行动口号，以促进某些具体的迫切问题的解决。
    在人民群众已经迫切要求某些新事物（新工具）的时候，这些新事物是必然会出现的。但出现的迟早在具体地区却是有偶然性的。在资本主义社会里，由于各个人各集团利害不一致，所以人们虽然老是想学习别人的新东西，赶上别人，但别人却总是不愿意自己的新东西
  （这是自己的王牌）给人家学去。时间最后可以征服一切秘密，把新的变成普遍的；但这时间却需要得很长，甚至会拖长到好多年以至整个的世纪。社会主义在这里有不可比拟的优越性。由于各地区利害的完全一致，所以在一个地区产生的新东西，能够在极短的时间内推广应用到广大地区。而应用别人经验的后进地区，往往会青出于蓝而胜于蓝，由学别人而赶过别人，成为先进地区，推动别人来进一步学新的，赶新的。这样，前进的速度就是资本主义所望尘莫及的了。
    互相学，互相赶，这是历史发展的一种规律。社会主义的规律有一个更重要的特点，就是有组织有领导的互相学和互相赶。因为现在政府也是人民自己的，与人民利益完全一致的，它能够组织和领导这种互相学和互相赶的群众运动，使它以许多倍的加速度向前发展。因此，人们一方面应当把互相学互相赶看成广大人民群众社会主义热情激荡的表现形式，看成群众蓬勃向上和汹涌前进的反映；另一方面也可以把这看成一种领导方法和领导责任。一切的领导干部，都应当走出办公室，到群众中去，随时注意发现群众中的新创造。同时要十分及时地组织大家互相学，互相赶。这种领导方法去冬以来空前地流行起来了，各地应当无例外地普遍采用，用以加速历史的进程。要知道，历史现在是掌握在我们手里的。
