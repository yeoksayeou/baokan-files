What is Malaria?
    Fushi

    The provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou on our country's frontiers are well-known for their malarial air. When Zhuge Liang campaigned in the south, Wang Wenyi, an advising minister, advised Liu Houzhu, saying, "The southern regions are barren lands, regions of malaria...". These barren lands and malarial regions refer to Yunnan and Guizhou. Later, although Zhuge Liang captured Meng Huo seven times and achieved a great victory, diseases continued to occur in the army. Especially when crossing the Lu River, "malarial fumes filled the air," causing "men and horses to be exhausted," "skin and flesh to peel off," "bodies to be weak," "hands and feet to be black," "mute and unable to speak," and "bleeding to death from the mouth and nose." These symptoms are described in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and are undoubtedly exaggerated and inaccurate. However, in ancient times, people always regarded those places as dangerous. Bai Juyi wrote in "The Old Man with a Broken Arm from Xin Feng": "I heard that there is the Lu River in Yunnan, when pepper flowers fall, malarial fumes rise, the army wades through water as hot as soup, before ten people have crossed, two or three die." Later generations who used troops in this area were all defeated by malaria.

    What exactly is malaria, and why is it so dangerous? It is actually malignant malaria. Malaria was recorded in our country more than two thousand years ago. The "Book of Rites" and "Lüshi Chunqiu" both mentioned it. Our country's first medical book, "Huangdi Neijing," had a special chapter, "Suwen Malaria Treatise," which described the symptoms of malaria in detail. Later, Zhang Zhongjing, a famous doctor of the Han Dynasty, discussed the development and prognosis of malaria in his book "Synopsis of the Golden Chamber." By the Sui Dynasty, Chao Yuanfang had distinguished several types of malaria, including "tertian malaria," "labor malaria," "malaria with no fixed onset time," and "mountain malaria."

    However, our ancestors could not discover that malaria was caused by malarial parasites, but thought it was caused by "damp and hot air from mountains and rivers," "irregularities of the four seasons," or "evil spirits." European countries also always thought it was a kind of "bad air." Even after the invention of the microscope, people did not find these malarial parasites for a while.

    The discovery of malarial parasites was after 1880. There are many types, but only three often interact with people: tertian malaria parasites, quartan malaria parasites, and malignant malaria parasites. It relies on a special mosquito – a large, flower-winged, tail-up mosquito – to spread. The malarial parasite parasitizes human red blood cells and divides, one becomes two, two becomes four. Finally, the red blood cell cannot hold any more, bursts, and releases some toxins. The symptoms then appear: first chills, then fever, dry mouth, headache, and finally a burst of sweat, seemingly recovered. This is a typical symptom. Malignant malaria often has dangerous symptoms: cerebral type with coma and convulsions, cholera type with vomiting and diarrhea, renal type, jaundice type, etc. However, although the symptoms of malignant malaria are dangerous, once cured, it rarely recurs. Tertian and quartan malaria, however, have a proportion of patients who relapse after recovery.

    The reason why malaria attacks are very regular is related to the parasite's reproductive cycle. The time it takes for a parasite to enter a red blood cell, divide into several or even dozens of small parasites, destroy the red blood cell, and re-invade healthy red blood cells is forty-eight hours for tertian malaria, so it occurs once every two days; seventy-two hours for quartan malaria, so it occurs once every three days; malignant malaria is roughly twenty-four to forty-eight hours, so the onset time is not fixed. Some people may also have two or more types of malarial parasites at the same time, so the onset time is irregular.

    Our country also discovered medicines for treating malaria very early. "Shen Nong's Herbal Classic" says that Changshan can treat malaria, and Zhang Zhongjing said that Shuqi can treat malaria (Shuqi is the seedling of Changshan). Today, we have no less than a dozen kinds of antimalarial drugs. Traditional Chinese medicine also uses acupuncture to treat malaria, without the need for medication, and the effect is very good.

    Since liberation, all localities have the conditions to pay attention to hygiene, and various epidemics have been reduced or eliminated. The malarial air in Yunnan and Guizhou is also about to become a historical term. In the Simao area of Yunnan, malaria was particularly rampant before liberation, and in some villages, it was almost impossible to find a couple who were both alive. After liberation, the antimalarial team went deep into the area to eliminate the "malarial air," and malaria was greatly reduced. The people of Simao praised: "Chairman Mao has come, and the malarial air has also disappeared!"

    瘴气是怎么回事？
    富士
    我国边疆的云南、贵州诸省，瘴疠之气很有名。当年诸葛亮南征，就有位叫王文仪的谏臣向刘后主谏说：“南方不毛之地，瘴疫之乡，……。”这不毛之地、瘴疫之乡，指的就是云、贵地方。后来诸葛亮虽然七擒孟获，大获全胜，可是军中不断发生疾病，特别是在渡泸水的时候，“瘴烟弥漫”，弄得“人马困乏”、“皮肉尽脱”、“身躯软弱”、“手足皆黑”、“哑口不能言”、“口鼻出血而死”。这种种症状是“三国演义”里描写的，不无言过其实和不确的地方。但是，古时人们一向把那些地方视为畏地。白居易在“新丰折臂翁”里写过：“闻道云南有泸水，椒花落时瘴烟起，大军徒涉水如汤，未过十人二三死。”其后历代用兵这一带的，也莫不为瘴气所挫。
    瘴疠，究竟是什么东西，这么厉害？其实就是恶性疟疾。疟疾，早在二千多年前，我国就有记载。如周礼、吕氏春秋都曾谈到：我国第一部医书“黄帝内经”曾专有一章“素问疟论”，精到地描述了疟疾的症状。其后汉代名医张仲景更在“金匮要略”一书里论述了疟疾的发展和预后。到隋代，巢元方还分辨出疟疾有“间日疟”，“劳疟”、“发作无时疟”、“山瘴疟”等几种类型。
    不过，我们的祖先还不能发现疟疾是疟原虫在作疟，却以为是什么“山川湿热郁蒸之气”、“四时不正之气”、“邪魅”等东西作祟。西欧各国也一直以为这是一种“恶气”而已。即使在显微镜发明之后，人们一时也还没有寻出这种疟原虫来。
    疟原虫的发现，是1880年以后的事。它的种类很多，但经常和人们打交道的只有三种，是间日疟原虫、三日疟原虫、和恶性疟原虫。它是依靠一种特殊的蚊子——大个儿、花翅膀、翘尾巴的蚊子来传播的。疟原虫寄生在人的红血球内进行分裂，一变二，二变四，最后，红血球装不下了，涨破了，释放出一些毒物来。症状就来了：起先是寒战，继而发热，口干，头痛，最后出一阵汗，霍然若愈，这是典型的症状。恶性疟疾则常有凶险的症状：有昏迷抽搐的脑型，上吐下泻的霍乱型，肾型，黄疸型，等等。不过，恶性疟疾的症状虽然凶险，但一旦治好，就很少复发的。而二、三日疟，却有一部分病人会愈后复发。
    疟疾发作之所以非常规律，是和原虫繁殖的周期有关的。一个原虫从钻入红血球起，到分裂成几个甚至几十个小原虫、破坏红血球、重新侵入健康的红血球所需要的时间，间日疟是四十八小时，因此两天发作一次；三日疟是七十二小时，因此三天发作一次；恶性疟大致是二十四—四十八小时，因此发作时间不一定。也有一人兼得两种以上的疟原虫的，发作时间就没规律了。
    治疗疟疾的药品，我国也早有发现。“神农本草经”上说常山可以疗疟，张仲景说蜀漆可以治疟（蜀漆就是常山的苗）。今天，我们的治疟药已不下十数种。中医还用针灸治疟，不需服药，而效果很好。
    解放以后，各地都有条件讲卫生，各种流行病都减少或消灭了。云南、贵州地方的瘴气，也快成为历史上的名词了。云南思茅一带，解放前瘴气特别猖獗，有些村庄几乎找不出一家是夫妇双全的；解放后抗疟队深入扫除“瘴气”，疟疾大减，思茅人民纷纷称道：“毛主席来了，瘴气也消了！”
