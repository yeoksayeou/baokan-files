Xinhua News Agency, 24th -- The Henan Provincial People's Committee, based on the eighty-three kinds of advanced irrigation tools and various cement substitutes exhibited at the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Advanced Tool Exchange Conference currently being held, issued "Instructions on Rapidly and Universally Promoting Various Irrigation Tools and Indigenous Cement Manufacturing Methods" on the 19th. The instructions require the people of the entire province to exert their utmost efforts to manufacture one million irrigation tools of various types and 100,000 tons of indigenous cement in a year to ensure a bumper agricultural harvest this year. The instructions analyzed the current situation in the province, where both water conservancy construction and production are developing by leaps and bounds. As of March 12th, the irrigated area in the province had reached 87,620,000 mu, and it is expected to reach 100 million mu before the wheat harvest, accounting for 74% of the province's total cultivated area, basically achieving water conservancy. The spring plowing production campaign has also been fully launched, and the masses in various places are using boundless enthusiasm to devise all possible ways to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year. Therefore, with the rapid development of the water conservancy movement and the spring plowing movement, there is an urgent need for a large number of irrigation tools and cement to meet the needs of various water conservancy construction projects. In order to promote the many inventions and creations of the masses in various places in irrigation tools and indigenous cement manufacturing at the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Advanced Tool Exchange Conference, the instructions put forward four specific measures: First, it is necessary to deeply mobilize the masses throughout the province, rely on the masses, and manufacture various irrigation tools and cement locally and in accordance with local conditions, based on the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical, to meet the needs of current production and construction and overcome the idea of simply relying on the state. Second, in the first half of this year, in addition to the timely supply of 180,000 horsepower of power irrigation machinery supplied by the state to rural areas, it is required to organize the masses to promote the manufacture of 500,000 irrigation tools of various types in the first half of the year, and one million pieces throughout the year. Third, universally promote the experience of Zhuge Township in Yanshi County in manufacturing cement using indigenous methods and the experience of Dengfeng and other counties in manufacturing cement substitutes. It is required that the entire province manufacture 100,000 tons of cement and cement substitutes using indigenous methods this year, and rush to produce 50,000 tons before June. Fourth, governments at all levels must recognize that rapidly promoting the manufacture of various irrigation tools and cement is the key to ensuring a bumper agricultural harvest and a great leap forward this year. Therefore, they must immediately take action, strengthen leadership, assign special personnel to be responsible, convene emergency meetings, and formulate specific plans to ensure that they are realized on schedule. Various business departments must also closely cooperate with each other. The industrial and handicraft departments must also concentrate their efforts to rush production and organize the transfer of manufacturing technology. The commercial departments must also vigorously organize the supply of materials and do a good job in purchasing and sales.

　　At the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Advanced Tool Exhibition, among the more than 260 advanced tools, there were as many as 83 kinds of irrigation tools. These irrigation tools utilize water power, wind power, fire power, human power, and animal power, and their efficiency is several times to dozens of times higher than that of the original irrigation tools. According to incomplete statistics, if the province fully adopts the new simple and efficient irrigation tools for irrigation in the spring watering of wheat this year, the province can save 450 million labor days.

    赶制提水工具百万件
    生产土制水泥十万吨
    河南省人委号召群众想尽办法保证丰收
    新华社24日专电　河南省人民委员会根据正在举行的河南省水利先进工具交流会上展出的八十三种先进提水工具和各种水泥代用品，在19日发出“关于迅速普遍推广各种提水工具和土法制造水泥的指示”。指示要求全省人民鼓足干劲，一年制造各种提水工具百万件，土制水泥十万吨，保证今年农业大丰收。指示中分析了当前全省的情况，是水利建设和生产高潮都在一日千里的飞跃发展。到3月12日止，全省灌溉面积已经达到八千七百六十二万亩，预计到麦收前可以发展到一亿亩，占全省总耕地面积的74％，基本上实现水利化，春耕生产运动也已经全面展开，各地群众正在以无比高涨的热情，想尽一切办法争取今年农业大丰收。因此随着水利化运动和春耕运动的迅速发展，当前就迫切需要大量的提水工具和水泥，供应各项水利建设工程的需要。为了推广河南省水利先进工具交流会上各地群众在提水工具和土法制造水泥方面的许多发明创造，指示中提出了四项具体措施：第一，要在全省范围内深入的发动群众，依靠群众，本着多、快、好、省的方针，就地取材、因地制宜制造各种提水工具和水泥，以适应当前生产建设的需要，克服单纯依赖国家的思想。第二，今年上半年，除把国家供应的十八万匹马力的动力灌溉机械及时供应农村外，要求上半年组织群众推广制造各种提水工具五十万件，全年制造一百万件。第三，普遍推广偃师县诸葛乡用土法制造水泥和登封等县制造代水泥的经验，要求全省今年用土法制造水泥和代水泥十万吨，6月以前赶制出五万吨。第四，各级政府，必需认识迅速推广制造各种提水工具和水泥，是保证今年农业丰收、大跃进的关键，因此，必须立即动手，加强领导，指定专人负责，召开紧急会议，订出具体计划，保证如期实现，各个业务部门也要密切协作，相互配合，工业和手工业部门也要集中力量，加紧赶制，组织好制造技术的传授工作。商业部门也要大力组织物资供应和做好收购和推销工作。
    河南省水利先进工具展览会上二百六十多种先进工具里，其中提水工具就达八十三种，这些提水工具利用水力、风力、火力、人力、畜力，效率比原有的提水工具都要提高几倍到几十倍。据不精确的统计，如果全省今年在春浇小麦中全部采用既简便、效率又高的新式提水工具进行灌溉，全省就可以节省四亿五千万个劳动日。
