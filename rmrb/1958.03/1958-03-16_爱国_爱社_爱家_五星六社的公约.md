Based on the various problems exposed in the current mass rectification movement and socialist debate, in order to further consolidate the results of the rectification, resolutely implement the principles of diligence and thrift in running the commune and democratic management; in order to combine the interests of the state, the interests of the agricultural cooperative, and the personal interests of the members; in order to establish a democratic style of work among cadres, improve working methods, and strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses; and to create a new political situation within the agricultural cooperative that is both centralized and democratic, both free and disciplined, the following covenant on loving the country, loving the collective, and loving the family has been formulated after discussion by the general assembly of all members:

	I. It is imperative to resolutely implement the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, cotton, oil, and other materials. All materials subject to the state's unified purchase must be sold to the state at the price stipulated by the state, and no speculation or sale to private individuals is allowed.

	II. Agricultural cooperatives must be honest with the state, production teams (villages) must be honest with the cooperative, and members must be honest with the state and the cooperative; resolutely oppose concealing production, deceiving the state, deceiving the agricultural cooperative, and all other forms of concealment.

	III. Obey state plans and live within our means according to state plans; oppose any departmentalism or individualism on the part of any unit or individual that disregards the overall interests of the state.

	IV. Adhere to democratic management of the cooperative, promote a democratic style of work among cadres, and cadres must listen to the opinions of the masses when handling affairs. When deciding on major issues, repeated consultations with the masses should be conducted, absorbing the correct opinions of the masses, and opposing the administrative command style of a few individuals making hasty decisions and acting arbitrarily.

	V. Both cooperative cadres and members must actively participate in labor. Cooperative cadres must go to the fields to participate in production, share weal and woe with the masses, and solve practical problems in production. Those who are lazy and refuse to reform after education should be appropriately restricted in the distribution of various material objects; in addition, they must be forced to engage in labor and production under the supervision of the broad masses of members.

	VI. Obey leadership and abide by labor discipline. In the allocation of various farm work, it is imperative to obey leadership and not be picky or greedy, or scramble for work points; every member should ensure that the assigned production tasks are completed on time, both in terms of quantity and quality. Necessary criticism or struggle must be carried out against those who violate labor discipline.

	VII. Except for legitimate household sideline occupations, no one is allowed to engage in illegitimate sideline occupations, and no one is allowed to engage in speculative activities that affect collective production.

	VIII. Male and female members must be reasonably assessed work points according to the principle of equal pay for equal work in obtaining labor remuneration.

	IX. Strictly enforce financial regulations and make financial income and expenditure public. Various distributions of the agricultural cooperative, purchases of means of production and implements, member advances, state loans and their uses must be published regularly, so as to achieve daily clearance and monthly settlement; resolutely oppose illegal acts such as recording more income than actual, reporting less expenditure than actual, failing to record income, and doubling expenditure.

	X. Resolutely oppose corruption, theft, and various acts of seeking personal gain and engaging in malfeasance, safeguard collective interests, and ensure the integrity of every cadre and member.

	XI. In addition to the holidays stipulated within the cooperative, every cadre and member must adhere to the leave system. Members must apply for leave from the team leader for any outside business, and must only leave after the team leader's permission; otherwise, they must not leave without authorization.

	XII. Every member should treat the cooperative as their home, establish the concept of loving the cooperative, cherish all public property within the cooperative, and cherish all trees and forests. Damage to public property, indiscriminate felling of trees, and destruction of young forests must be severely dealt with.

	XIII. Every member must manage livestock and poultry such as calves, piglets, lambs, rabbits, chickens, and dogs, and prohibit them from trampling on crops and grain in the fields or on the threshing ground; those who discover and report such incidents should be commended or appropriately rewarded, and the owner should be held responsible for compensation.

	XIV. Strengthen livestock management, and herders should perform their duties well. Members should cherish and use them carefully, and should not beat livestock indiscriminately. Cooperative cadres should carefully inspect them to ensure that livestock are plump and fat, and that their health is guaranteed.

	XV. Establish the ethos of diligence and thrift in managing the household, practice strict economy, especially in saving grain, and promote the fine traditions of careful calculation and hard work and plain living, oppose extravagance and waste, and conduct necessary criticism or struggle against those who waste.

	XVI. Establish and promote the socialist virtues of supporting the elderly and cherishing the young, and harmonious families, and oppose abuse of parents-in-law, abuse of children and daughters-in-law.

	XVII. Pay attention to environmental and personal hygiene, wash clothes and bedding frequently, and combine this with fertilizer accumulation to regularly clean the streets in front of the door. Every household must cultivate a new habit of a clean and civilized socialist life.

	XVIII. Every cadre and member must enthusiastically participate in various political activities, actively participate in various meetings, oppose absenteeism and unjustified absences; and regularly participate in political, cultural, and technical studies to improve everyone's political awareness, cultural and technical level, in order to meet the needs of socialist construction.

	XIX. Cadres and cadres, members and members should strengthen mutual love and enhance unity; resolutely oppose bad phenomena such as hitting and scolding people, bullying the neighborhood, and cursing in the streets.

	XX. Raise vigilance and strictly guard against sabotage of production by illegal landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements. All members should, in the spirit of patriotism and collectivism, expose and report all sabotage activities. The agricultural cooperative should commend or reward those who have contributed to the exposure and reporting.

Cooperative cadres and members should supervise each other and resolutely abide by the above covenant. Those who violate any of the above provisions will be given education and criticism for minor offenses; for serious offenses, members should launch discussions and struggle against them; those who violate the law should be submitted to the political and legal organs for legal sanctions to ensure the consolidation of the agricultural cooperative and the development of production.
