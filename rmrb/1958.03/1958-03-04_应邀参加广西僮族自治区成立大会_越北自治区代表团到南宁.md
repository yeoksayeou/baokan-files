Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 3rd: The delegation of people from all ethnic groups of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, invited to China to attend the founding of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, arrived in Nanning by special train at 11:15 AM on the 3rd. The delegation, headed by Zhu Wenjin, was warmly welcomed at the train station by more than 4,000 workers, government officials, students, and citizens of Nanning.

The head of the delegation, Zhu Wenjin, the deputy head, Phan Van Tinh, and Yang Gong Huo got off the train and were warmly greeted by Wei Guoqing, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Deputy Chairman Qin Yingji, and others. Zhu Wenjin and Wei Guoqing, Qin Yingji repeatedly embraced each other warmly. A group of young people in colorful costumes ran up to present flowers to the delegation members. As Wei Guoqing accompanied head of the delegation Zhu Wenjin to the station podium, the welcoming crowd waved bouquets and applauded and cheered for the delegation.

In his welcoming speech, Wei Guoqing, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, expressed a warm welcome to the delegation of people from all ethnic groups of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He said that in August 1956, when the Viet Bac Autonomous Region was established, we were honored to receive your invitation and sent a delegation from Guangxi Province to participate in the grand ceremony for the founding of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region. Today, a year and a half later, you are invited to attend the festival for the founding of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. These are two great happy events in the friendly exchanges between the people of China and Vietnam. Although we belong to two different countries, the establishment of both the Viet Bac Autonomous Region and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are equally brilliant victories for the Marxist-Leninist policy on nationalities. Our close exchanges will greatly enhance the feelings between the people of China and Vietnam and further strengthen the friendship and unity between the people of the two countries.

Next, head of the delegation Zhu Wenjin spoke, saying, "Our delegation of people from all ethnic groups of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has come to the beautiful capital of the soon-to-be-established Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region today, and we are very honored and touched by the warm welcome from comrades and friends. On behalf of all members of the delegation, I extend our cordial, brotherly congratulations to comrades and friends."

Head of the delegation Zhu Wenjin said that the people of Vietnam and China have had a long and good relationship for a long time, especially since Viet Bac and Guangxi are adjacent to each other, this relationship is even closer. The people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi and the people of all ethnic groups in Viet Bac have many similarities in geography, history, and customs. He said that today, as we set foot on the land of your beautiful autonomous region, under your warm and cordial welcome, we feel even more deeply the profound friendship between the people of the two countries' two autonomous regions.

Head of the delegation Zhu Wenjin said that the more than 19 million people of more than ten ethnic groups in Guangxi have united into an unbreakable whole, and have achieved brilliant achievements in agricultural cooperation, in the socialist transformation of industry and commerce, in the development of socialist culture, and in improving the lives of people of all ethnic groups. He said that the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is another great victory for the ethnic regional autonomy policy of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government. He said that the brilliant achievements of the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi and the people of all ethnic groups in China make us feel very excited. We regard those achievements as our own.

In his speech, head of the delegation Zhu Wenjin introduced the brilliant achievements made by the Vietnamese people in recent years under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh. He said that the people of our Viet Bac have established an autonomous region in August 1956, and are stepping up efforts to build the autonomous region. He then talked about the achievements of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region in strengthening the unity of the people of all ethnic groups, developing various construction undertakings, and improving people's lives. He said that the people of all ethnic groups in the Viet Bac Autonomous Region are more confident in the superior ethnic policies of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government, and are working harder to produce, work, and study in order to do a good job in various construction undertakings in the autonomous region.

Head of the delegation Zhu Wenjin said that the Guangxi delegation left us with a very deep impression during their stay in our Viet Bac Autonomous Region. Today, our delegation of people from all ethnic groups of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region is coming with a happy mood to participate in the upcoming founding conference of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. We once again have the opportunity to meet, which makes our already deep feelings even deeper.

Head of the delegation Zhu Wenjin's enthusiastic speech repeatedly aroused warm applause.

Today, Nanning Station was full of colorful flowers, and large welcome slogans were hung. After the welcoming ceremony at the station ended, the delegation was applauded and welcomed by the crowd in the station square, and several Young Pioneers presented flowers to head of the delegation Zhu Wenjin one after another. Then the hosts accompanied the distinguished guests by car into the city.

On their way from Pingxiang to Nanning, the delegation of people from all ethnic groups of the Viet Bac Autonomous Region was also warmly welcomed by more than 1,900 people in Chongshan Station in Chongzuo County.

Nguyen Mai, the acting consul of the Vietnamese Consulate in Nanning, also came to the station to welcome them today.

    应邀参加广西僮族自治区成立大会
    越北自治区代表团到南宁
    新华社南宁3日电　应邀来我国参加广西僮族自治区成立大会的越南民主共和国越北自治区各族人民代表团在3日十一时一刻乘专车到达南宁。以朱文晋为首的代表团人员在火车站上受到南宁市工人、机关干部、学生、市民共四千多人的热烈欢迎。
    代表团团长朱文晋、副团长潘文省、杨公活下车后，前来欢迎他们的广西僮族自治区筹备委员会主任委员韦国清、副主任委员覃应机等人和他们热烈握手。朱文晋和韦国清、覃应机还一再互相热烈拥抱。一群穿着彩色服装的青年跑来向代表团人员献花。当韦国清陪着朱文晋团长走向车站讲台的时候，欢迎的人群挥舞着花束，向代表团鼓掌欢呼。
    韦国清在致欢迎词中，代表广西各族人民对越南民主共和国越北自治区各族人民代表团表示热烈欢迎。他说，在1956年8月，越北自治区成立的时候，我们曾经荣幸地得到你们的邀请，派出了广西省民族代表团前往参加越北自治区成立的盛典。在一年半以后的今天，你们又应邀来参加广西僮族自治区成立的节日。这是中越两国人民友谊来往上的两件大喜事。虽然我们分属两个国家，可是越北自治区和广西僮族自治区的成立，都同样是马克思列宁主义的民族政策的辉煌胜利。我们的亲切来往，将会大大增进中越两国人民的感情，进一步加强两国人民的友谊和团结。
    接着，朱文晋团长讲话，他说：“我们越南民主共和国越北自治区各族人民代表团今天来到即将成立的广西僮族自治区美丽的首府南宁，受到同志们和朋友们的热烈欢迎，我们感到非常荣幸和感动。我代表全体团员向同志们和朋友们致以亲切的、兄弟般的祝贺。”
    朱文晋团长说，越中两国人民很久以来就有悠久的良好关系，特别是越北和广西毗连，这种关系更加密切。广西各族人民和越北各族人民，在地理上、历史上和风俗习惯上都有很多相同之点。他说，今天我们踏上你们美丽的自治区的土地，在你们殷勤和亲切欢迎下，我们更进一步感到两国人民的两个自治区的深厚的友谊。
    朱文晋团长说，广西十多个民族的一千九百多万人民已团结成为牢不可破的整体，在农业合作化、在对工商业的社会主义改造中、在发展社会主义的文化和提高各族人民的生活中已经取得了辉煌的成就。他说，广西僮族自治区的成立，是中国共产党和中国政府的民族区域自治政策又一次的伟大胜利。他说，广西各族人民和中国各族人民的辉煌成就使我们感到非常兴奋。我们把那些成就看成是自己的成就。
    朱文晋团长在讲话中介绍了越南人民在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席领导下几年来所取得的辉煌成就。他说，我们越北人民已在1956年8月成立了自治区，并且正在加紧努力进行自治区的建设。他接着谈到了越北自治区在加强各民族人民团结、发展各项建设事业和提高人民生活等方面的成就。他说，越北自治区各族人民更加相信越南劳动党和政府优越的民族政策，并且更加努力生产、工作和学习，以便做好自治区各项建设事业。
    朱文晋团长说，广西各族人民代表团在我们越北自治区的期间，给我们留下了极深刻的印象。今天我们越北自治区各族人民代表团又抱着愉快的心情来参加即将举行的广西僮族自治区成立大会。我们再次有见面的机会，使我们早有的深厚的感情更加深厚。
    朱文晋团长热情的讲话一再引起热烈的掌声。
    今天南宁车站上到处是鲜艳的花朵，悬挂着大幅的欢迎标语。当车站上的欢迎仪式结束后，代表团在车站广场上又受到群众的鼓掌欢迎，有几个少先队员接连给朱文晋团长献花。然后主人们陪着贵宾们乘车进入市区。
    越北自治区各族人民代表团从凭祥到南宁途中，在崇善车站还受到崇左县一千九百多人的热烈欢迎。
    今天到车站欢迎的还有越南驻南宁市领事馆的代领事阮梅。
