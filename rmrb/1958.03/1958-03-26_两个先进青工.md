    Two Advanced Young Workers

    Liao Sirong (right), a young worker at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, recently boldly innovated processing technology, increasing work efficiency by 28 times, and became a model for workers' competitions and appraisals in the city.

    Liao Sirong is a young worker who joined the factory in 1953. He is currently doing the punching work for sewing machine handles. The original processing method was to drill holes with a drilling machine, which took more than a minute to make one piece, and the daily production quota was 350 pieces. Recently, he broke the convention that punching machines could not be used for punching holes, and boldly changed drilling holes with a drilling machine to punching holes with a punching machine. The daily output quickly rose to 10,080 pieces, and the quality fully met the specifications.

    Liao Shigang (left) is also an advanced young worker at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory. In the first half of this year, he actively reformed production technology, increasing the production efficiency of the lathe he manages by twelve times compared to the quota; recently, he found new tricks, increasing the production efficiency by twenty-five times compared to the quota, and can do twenty-six days of work in one day.

    两个先进青工
    重庆建设机床厂青年工人廖思荣（右）最近大胆地革新加工技术，提高工作效率二十八倍，成了全市工人竞赛、评比的标兵。
    廖思荣是1953年才进厂的青年工人，现在做的是缝纫机搬手的打眼工作。原来的加工方法是用钻床钻眼，一分多钟才做一件，日产量定额是三百五十件。最近，他打破了不能用冲床冲孔的陈规，大胆地把钻床钻孔改为冲床冲孔，日产量迅速上升到一万零八十件，质量完全符合规格。
    廖世刚（左）也是重庆建设机床厂先进青工，今年上半年他积极改革生产技术，使他所管理的车床的生产效率比定额提高了十二倍；最近，他又找到了新的窍门，使生产效率比定额提高了二十五倍，一天能做二十六天的活。（附图片）
