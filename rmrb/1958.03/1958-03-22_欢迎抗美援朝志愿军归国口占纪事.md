Welcoming the Return of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army from the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea: A Poem Written on the Spot
        Chen Shutong

	The proposal to withdraw troops was initiated in Korea,
	Its righteousness and sternness shook the nine seas.
	Did the aggressive bloc feel ashamed?
	Creating conditions to lay the foundation for peace.
	Colorful floats welcomed them through the triumphal arch,
	Thunderous cheers and fanfare resounded.
	Beloved people came vying to recognize their faces,
	Transformed from surprise into tears of joy.
	Breaking through the morning mist to reveal the clear sky,
	Men and women of the city flocked to the square.
	Giving speeches one after another, shouting "Long Live!"
	Banners and flags fluttered all around.
	Distributing gifts revealed deep affection,
	Unbuttoning my clothes with earnest and warm feelings (note).
	Said it was an old woman's dowry,
	Gratefully given as a gift, more precious than a frost-covered sword.
	Welcoming and seeing off, warmly linked together,
	New justice across the river and Andong,
	Eternal friendship truly without limit,
	Fresh blood solidified into the merit of resisting U.S. aggression.
	A gathering for a cordial discussion, a grand banquet opened,
	Endless joyful exchanges and toasting with cups.
	Rare and clear songs aided the remaining joy,
	The evening party continued to urge each other on after the music ended.
	The high tide of the Great Leap Forward is just at this moment,
	Your heroic feats are teachers to the people of the country.
	Returning to join the ranks of farmers and workers,
	Another force in the great army of production.
	Twenty-eight envoys participated,
	Exactly matching the predicted number, sharing the dust of the journey.
	Four days of coming and going, never enough,
	Fortunately completing the mission anew.

Note: General Zhang Tianyun presented me with a small sword, a gift from Korea.
