Xinhua News Agency, March 12th – The train drivers of the Guye Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Administration have created a new record of an average of 1,813,000 ton-kilometers per locomotive per day, leading all locomotive depots in the country.

Half a month ago, the employees of this locomotive depot proposed a leap forward plan to reach an average daily output of 1.6 million ton-kilometers per locomotive before "May Day" this year, as an indicator for launching a friendly competition with locomotive depots across the country's railways. On March 5th, after the employees of this depot heard the good news of the Nanjing Locomotive Depot's daily output of 1.68 million ton-kilometers, the entire depot immediately erupted. Meetings were held for days to study measures to catch up with the advanced, and the action slogan of "Surpassing the Nanjing Depot" was put forward. Through the efforts of all employees of the depot and the cooperation of relevant departments of the bureau, the highest record of 1,813,000 ton-kilometers was finally created, ranking first among the railway locomotive depots in the country. The Locomotive Group No. ㄇㄎ—四○一○ also created a national record of 2,657,000 ton-kilometers per day between Shanhaiguan and Tianjin on the 10th.

On the 11th, the depot also successfully tested the driving and scheduling method of "super-axle traction, high-speed operation," opening up a new path for the depot's locomotives to regularly increase daily ton-kilometers.

    古冶机务段跃上机车日产新高峰
    一百八十一万吨公里
    新华社12日讯　北京铁路管理局古冶机务段职工驾驶的火车头，创造了平均每台机车日产一百八十一万三千吨公里的新纪录，跑在全国机务段的最前面。
    这个机务段的职工在半个月前曾提出要在今年“五一”前达到平均每台机车日产一百六十万吨公里的跃进计划，作为向全国铁路各机务段展开友谊竞赛的指标。3月5日，这个段的职工听到南京机务段日产一百六十八万吨公里的捷报后，全段立刻沸腾起来，连日召开会议，研究赶上先进的措施，提出了“超过南京段”的行动口号，经过全段职工努力和全局有关部门的配合下，终于创造了一百八十一万三千吨公里的最高纪录，跃居全国铁路机务段的首位。ㄇㄎ—四○一○号机车组，10日在山海关到天津间，还创造了日产二百六十五万七千吨公里的全国最高纪录。
    11日，这个段又试验成功“超轴牵引、高速运行”的驾驶和调度方法，给全段机车经常地提高日产吨公里开辟了新的道路。
