Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 13th: The state-owned Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant is vigorously responding to the challenge from the Soviet Yaroslavl Electric Machinery Plant. At noon on the 11th, thousands of workers from the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant gathered in the square in the rain. At the meeting, the chairman of the trade union read out the friendly competition challenge letter from the Soviet Yaroslavl Electric Machinery Plant. The Yaroslavl plant is an advanced electric machinery manufacturing plant with a high level of technology and advanced experience. Their challenge has greatly encouraged the electric machinery plant workers, who are striving for a great leap forward in production with the force of ten thousand horses galloping.

In order to respond to the Soviet Yaroslavl plant's challenge, and to launch a competition with brother factories across the country, the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant workers put forward the resounding slogan of "Leap Forward, Leap Forward, and Leap Forward Again!" The challenge response letter passed by the workers' congress guarantees that the number of new product projects in 1958 will leap forward from 42 to 58. Furthermore, the major new product originally scheduled to be successfully trial-produced in 1959 – a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator – will be trial-produced successfully ahead of schedule in 1958. The total output value is also guaranteed to leap forward from a 68% increase compared to last year to a 110% increase. An additional 25 large-scale motors will be produced, bringing the total target to 140 units.

    海外下战表倡议竞赛
    冒雨大誓师奋起应战
    据新华社上海13日电  国营上海电机厂奋起向苏联雅罗斯拉夫电机厂应战。11日中午，上海电机厂几千职工冒雨在广场上集会。会上由工会主席宣读了苏联雅罗斯拉夫电机厂的友谊竞赛挑战书。雅罗斯拉夫厂是一个先进的电机制造厂，有高度的技术水平和先进经验。他们的挑战，对于正以万马奔腾之势争取生产大跃进的电机厂职工，起了莫大的鼓舞作用。
    为了向苏联雅罗斯拉夫厂应战，和向全国兄弟工厂开展竞赛，上海电机厂职工提出了“跃进、跃进、再跃进”的响亮口号。职工大会通过的应战书上，保证1958年新产品项目要从四十二项再跃进到五十八项；并且要把原定1959年试制成功的重大新产品——二万五千瓩汽轮发电机，提前到1958年试制成功；总产值也保证要从比去年增长68％再跃进到增长110％；再增产二十五台大型电机，总指标达到一百四十台。
