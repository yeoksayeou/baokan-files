Talk of the Town

    If You Have Time, Read More Books!

    Some cadres, after having children, are almost completely immersed in the "joys of family." After work, they find all sorts of ways to play with their children, one shift of playing after work leading to another shift before work. Day after day, it’s a continuous cycle. During holidays, they spend all their time playing with their children, even pushing them around the streets.

    I am certainly not saying that everyone should not take care of their children; children absolutely should be cared for. I am merely advising some comrades not to spend too much time on their children. As the saying goes, "Proficiency comes from diligence, neglect from play!" I believe that those who waste their precious time on "the joys of family" are also engaging in a form of "neglect through play!" During the Han Dynasty, Zhu Maichen, due to poverty, made a living selling firewood. Even while selling firewood, he would walk and read. Zhu Maichen's situation is, of course, not directly comparable to ours, but his spirit of not wasting time and burying himself in diligent study is worth learning from.

    Let us also break the routine of holidays, be more "diligent" and less "playful." Let us also have a great leap forward in our spare-time studies, and accelerate our pace towards becoming both "red and expert."

    Recently, I have noticed that the trend of playing poker and mahjong is extremely prevalent in many offices and dormitories. As soon as work ends, the sounds of "discarding," "eating," and "ponging" fill the offices, with some games lasting until the lights-out bell. Even during the ten-minute exercise break, some people try to squeeze in a quick game. Some play all night on Saturday evenings, and on Sundays, they continue until 10 PM. If it weren't for work the next day, they would definitely play for half the night.职工俱乐部麻将牌也买的很多。

    Naturally, appropriate cultural entertainment is indispensable, but many of our comrades have too much enthusiasm for playing poker and mahjong, and too little enthusiasm for studying. Some only read the headlines of newspapers, don't read political theory books, don't delve into their professional skills, and spend most of their spare time on cultural and entertainment activities.

    Many comrades feel that this is a bad trend. Currently, we are in a new upsurge of socialist production and construction. The Party Central Committee calls on us to become "both red and expert" cadres, calls on us to fight hard for three years, and we all feel that we are falling behind in the face of such a great task. So, why not put more of our remaining energy into reading? I advise those comrades who are tirelessly enjoying these games to spend their spare time studying Marxism-Leninism, learning politics, learning culture, and learning professional skills.

    有时间，就多读些书吧！
    有些机关干部有了孩子，就几乎整天沉醉在“天伦之乐”里了。一下班，他们便百样生法逗孩子玩，这个下班逗到那个上班。天天如此，川流不息。在假期里，他们更是以全部时间逗孩子玩，甚至，推着孩子到处跑大街。
    我决不是说每个人不应该照顾自己的孩子，孩子是完全应该照顾的。我只是劝有些同志不要把太多的时间花在孩子们身上。俗语说“业精于勤荒于嬉！”我认为那些把大好时光消磨在“天伦之乐”上的人也是一种“荒于嬉”！汉朝时候的朱买臣，家贫以卖柴为生，在卖柴时还且走且读书。朱买臣的情况当然与我们不能同日而语，但，他的不虚度光阴、埋头苦学精神是值得学习的。
    让我们也打破度假日的常规，多“勤”一些，少“嬉”一些。在业余学习上也来个大跃进，向着“又红又专”的方向，加快迈进的步伐。

    最近，我发现在不少机关和宿舍里打扑克和麻将牌的风气极盛。一下班，办公室中就“甩”和“吃”“碰”之声不绝，有的一打就打到息灯铃。工间操只有十分钟，也要抓紧打一把百分。星期六晚间有的打通宵，星期日还要干到晚间十点钟，如果不是第二天上班，一定还会打个半宵。职工俱乐部麻将牌也买的很多。
    自然，适当的文化娱乐是不可少的，可是我们有不少同志，对打扑克、麻将的劲头太大，唯独学习的劲头太差。看报纸有的只看个大标题，政治理论书籍不看，业务不钻研，业余时间大部分花在文化娱乐生活上去了。
    许多同志都觉得这是一种不好的风气。目前正是社会主义生产建设新高潮，党中央号召我们成为“又红又专”的干部，号召我们苦战三年，而我们每个人都感到在这样伟大的任务面前自己跟不上。那么，为什么不把剩余的精力多放些在读书上面呢？奉劝这些乐此不倦的同志们，有空还是钻研些马列主义，学习政治，学习文化，学习业务吧。
