    Baolan Railway to be Connected North and South Within the Year
    The southern section of the Baolan Railway began laying tracks northward from Huangya Station on March 1. In the first two days, more than 32.6 kilometers of track have been laid. It will be laid to Yinchuan by the end of this year, connecting with the northern section of the railway.
    In order to complete the entire Baolan Railway line within this year, the southern and northern sections will lay more than 540 kilometers of track this year, of which the southern section will lay more than 320 kilometers of track. The construction period is tight, and the task is enormous. (Xinhua News Agency)

    包兰路年内南北接轨
    包兰铁路南段在3月1日开始从黄崖车站向北铺轨。头两天里，已经铺好三十二公里六百多公尺的轨道。今年年底以前就可铺到银川，和北段铁路接轨。
    为了在今年内修通包兰铁路全线，南、北两段铁路今年共要铺轨五百四十多公里，其中南段铺轨三百二十多公里，工期紧迫，任务浩大。　（新华社）
