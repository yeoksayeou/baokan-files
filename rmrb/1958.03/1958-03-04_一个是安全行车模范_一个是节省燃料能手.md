    One is a Model of Safe Driving
     One is a Fuel-Saving Expert
    These two are both labor models from Tianjin Municipality, and truck drivers from the Tianjin Municipal Transportation Company. Zheng Deyi (right) is a model of safe driving, and Gao Huchen (left) is a fuel-saving expert. In the Great Leap Forward in production, they have both put forward Leap Forward plans. Zheng Deyi, having already driven safely for more than 240,000 kilometers, guarantees that he will not have any accidents in the next fifteen years, and will not report minor repairs during the period of the second Five-Year Plan. Gao Huchen proposed to save 1,300 liters of gasoline this year, and achieve 350,000 to 500,000 kilometers of safe driving without major repairs.

    一个是安全行车模范
     一个是节省燃料能手
    这两个都是天津市的劳动模范，天津市运输公司的汽车司机。郑德义（右）是安全行车的模范，高虎臣（左）是节省燃料的能手。他们在生产大跃进中又提出了跃进计划。郑德义在已经安全行车二十四万多公里的基础上，保证在今后十五年内不出任何事故，做到第二个五年计划期间不报小修。高虎臣提出今年节省汽油一千三百公升，达到安全行车三十五万至五十万公里无大修。
