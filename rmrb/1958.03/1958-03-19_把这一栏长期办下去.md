    Keep This Column Going Long-Term
    I think the "In Local Newspapers" column newly opened by the People's Daily is a very good column.
    Our country is leaping forward at an amazing pace. New people and new events are emerging one after another. In these boiling days, every reader hopes to know more and faster about the situation in every corner of the country. The "In Local Newspapers" column uses a summary format to introduce important news from local newspapers to readers in a timely manner, so that readers can not only understand important national news, but also simply know some important news from provinces and cities. This further meets the readers' requirements.
    I hope that the People's Daily will fix this column, keep it running for a long time, and hope that the introduction of local newspaper news can be more timely.

    把这一栏长期办下去
    我觉得人民日报新辟的“在各地报纸上”一栏，是一个很好的栏目。
    我们国家正在一日万里地跃进。新人新事层出不穷。在这沸腾的日子里，每一个读者都希望能更多更快地知道全国每一个角落的情况。“在各地报纸上”一栏，用摘要的形式把各地报纸上的重要新闻及时地向读者介绍，使读者除了能了解全国的重要消息外，还能够简单地知道各省市的一些重要消息。这样就进一步满足了读者的要求。
    但愿人民日报把这个栏目固定下来，长久办下去，并希望介绍地方报纸消息时能更及时一些。
