Dazhong Daily News: At a telephone conference convened by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on March 6, Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, issued a battle call to the people of Shandong Province: Launch a large-scale irrigation and water storage campaign to prevent spring drought in a timely manner.

Shandong Province plans to irrigate 80 million mu this spring, striving to reach 100 million mu. To achieve this goal, the key issues to be resolved currently are: (1) Do everything possible to develop water sources, and develop and utilize all water sources, whether they are large wells, small wells, deep wells, shallow wells, new springs, or old springs. Continue to adopt methods such as digging wells, tapping springs, and excavating mountain springs to expand water sources as much as possible. For all rivers, adopt methods of "sluices," "dams," and "dikes" to intercept and utilize them. For all pits and ponds, regardless of the amount of water accumulated, use the water to irrigate the land, irrigating more where there is more water and less where there is less water. (2) Vigorously level the land. It is necessary to ensure that after the wells are dug, the land is leveled, the reservoirs are repaired, and the canals are built, in order to ensure timely irrigation and expand the irrigated area. At the same time, conserve water as much as possible and improve irrigation capacity. (3) Actively solve the problem of water lifting tools. In addition to instructing the industrial and handicraft departments to cooperate in the production and repair of damaged water lifting tools, vigorously mobilize the masses to adopt the method of "people resting, tools not resting" to fully utilize the effectiveness of existing water lifting tools, so that one set of tools can be used as three. (4) Do a good job in specific organizational work. Properly resolve the issue of remuneration for various tasks, and launch a massive spring irrigation movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 11th: Shanxi Province held a spring plowing production mobilization broadcast rally on the 9th, calling on farmers throughout the province to go all out to overcome drought and ensure a bumper harvest of summer crops.

Fan Luduan, Deputy Director of the Agricultural Construction Department, said in a radio speech that overcoming the threat of drought and ensuring timely sowing has become a major task facing farmers throughout the province. He proposed to save irrigation water as much as possible and expand the irrigated area. He asked all localities to accelerate the progress of canal projects and level the land while building water conservancy projects to expand water sources, so that the newly built water conservancy projects can release water ahead of schedule. In general land, it is also necessary to universally harrow and plow to prevent drought and conserve soil moisture.

Li Shunda, a nationally renowned agricultural labor model, and eight other activist representatives also spoke. In addition to introducing advanced experiences in mountainous areas in building water conservancy projects, preventing drought and conserving soil moisture, rationally arranging and organizing labor, and wheat field management techniques, they proposed to launch a competition to compare advanced indicators and measures, compare the enthusiasm for drought prevention and soil moisture conservation, and compare more, faster, better, and more economical spring plowing production, to ensure the over-fulfillment of leap forward targets.

More than 60 wired broadcasting stations, more than 70,000 loudspeakers, and more than 30,000 radios throughout the province rebroadcast the meeting live, and organized a large number of cadres and farmers to listen.

Shaanxi Daily News: Drought is appearing in many areas of Shaanxi Province. The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held a telephone conference with responsible comrades from Xi'an City and various special and county committees, requesting that all summer crops and reserved cotton and autumn fields that can be spring irrigated must be irrigated at least once. Those with good conditions should strive for more irrigation. Summer crops that have not been winter irrigated should be irrigated as soon as possible to ensure the completion of the province's original plan of irrigating 10 million mu and exceeding it. In areas without water conservancy facilities, splashing irrigation should be vigorously promoted; the Shaanbei area can also continue to carry out the movement to carry water to moisten the fields. In places where the masses are not yet accustomed to spring irrigation, they should be widely organized to visit wheat fields that have been winter irrigated, and mobilize the masses to debate and compare. Attention should also be paid to wheat soil moisture conservation, and weeding should be done early and often; spring and summer sown crops must be universally deep ploughed, and sufficient base fertilizer must be applied, with the amount of fertilizer applied doubled compared to previous years.

Henan Daily News: The Henan Provincial People's Committee issued instructions, requiring all localities to seize the opportunity to make a concentrated effort to complete the spring wheat irrigation task. The instructions pointed out that due to less snow last winter and a lack of rain in the spring, the existing soil moisture content cannot meet the current needs of wheat growth, and drought has begun to appear. Therefore, leaders at all levels and the people of the province should actively mobilize, seize the time, and launch a concentrated spring wheat irrigation and universal top dressing movement, striving to complete the spring irrigation of 50 million mu of wheat and the universal application of one top dressing by the end of March.

The instructions require leaders at all levels to organize all departments to vigorously support the mass spring irrigation movement.

    开发所有水源　拦蓄一切河流
    用战斗精神扑灭旱象
    山东山西陕西河南四省号召展开蓄水春浇的群众运动
    本报讯　大众日报消息：在3月6日中共山东省委召开的电话会议上，省委第一书记舒同向山东全省人民提出战斗号召：开展大规模浇地运动和蓄水运动，及时预防春旱。
    山东省今春计划灌溉八千万亩，争取达到一亿亩。为了实现这个要求，当前要突出地解决的几个问题是：（1）千方百计开发水源，把所有的水源，无论是大井、小井、深井、浅井、新泉、旧泉，统统开发出来，利用起来，并继续采取打井、下泉、挖山泉等办法，尽量扩大水源；对于一切河流，要采取“闸”、“坝”、“堤”的办法拦起来，用起来；对于一切坑塘，不管积水多少，也都本着水多多浇、水少少浇的原则，把水都用来浇地。（2）大力平整土地。要做到打完井整完地，修好水库筑完渠，以保证适时灌溉，并扩大灌溉面积。同时尽量节约用水，提高灌溉能力。（3）积极解决提水工具问题。除责成工业、手工业部门协作生产和修理毁坏的提水工具以外，应大力发动群众采取歇人不歇工具的方法，充分发挥现有提水工具的效能，使一套工具顶三套用。（4）搞好具体的组织工作。并妥善解决各种任务的报酬问题，开展一个千军万马的春浇运动。
    本报特约新华社太原11日电　山西省9日举行春耕生产广播动员大会上，号召全省农民鼓足干劲，千方百计战胜干旱现象，保证夏季作物大丰收。
    农业建设厅副厅长范履端在广播讲话中说，战胜干旱威胁，保证适时播种，已成了全省农民面临的重大任务。他提出要千方百计节约灌溉用水，扩大浇地面积，要求各地在兴修水利扩大水源的同时，加速渠道工程的进度，平整土地，使新修水利工程提前放水。在一般土地里也要普遍耙磨，防旱保墒。
    全国著名农业劳动模范李顺达等八个积极分子代表也讲了话。他们除介绍了山区兴修水利、防旱保墒、合理安排组织劳动力，麦田管理技术等先进经验外，提出开展比指标、措施先进；比防旱保墒干劲、比春耕生产多、快、好、省的竞赛，保证跃进指标超额完成。
    全省六十多个有线广播站，七万多喇叭筒和三万多部收音机转播了会议实况，并且组织了广大干部和农民收听。
    本报讯　陕西日报消息：陕西省不少地区呈现旱象。中共陕西省委最近召开西安市和各专、县负责同志电话会议，要求凡可能春灌的夏田作物和预留棉、秋田，至少必须灌溉一次，条件好的要争取多灌，未冬灌的夏田作物，要尽先灌溉，保证完成全省原来计划的一千万亩灌溉任务，并且超过。没有水利设施的地区，应大量提倡泼浇；陕北地区还可继续开展抬水润田运动。在群众对春灌还不习惯的地方，应广泛组织到去冬灌溉过的麦田参观，发动群众辩论、对比。还应注意小麦保墒工作，要早锄、多锄；春播、夏播作物，必须普遍深耕，施足底肥，施肥量要比往年增加一倍。
    本报讯　河南日报消息：河南省人民委员会发出指示，要求各地抓紧时机突击完成春季浇麦任务。指示指出，由于去冬雪少，入春雨缺，现有墒情均不能满足当前小麦生长的需要，干旱现象已经开始出现。因此，各级领导和全省人民应该积极动员起来，抓紧时间，突击开展一个春季浇麦和普施追肥运动，力争3月底前完成春浇小麦五千万亩和普施一次追肥的任务。
    指示要求各级领导要组织各部门大力支援群众性的春浇运动。
