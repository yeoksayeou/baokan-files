    Opening a New Chapter in Art Education
    Lin Bi

    Art colleges bear a significant responsibility in building a Red and expert contingent on the literary and art front. As socialist construction requires more artistic vanguards, and as the entire society's demand for culture and art increases daily, what kind of talent are we sending out of the college gates? This question is placed before all art colleges, forcing their leaders to answer it.

    Since liberation, our art education has achieved great success, cultivating a large number of artistic talents for the country. They are scattered on the broad cultural and artistic front, and are an important force in our socialist literary and artistic cause. However, there are still serious problems in art education, that is, in many art colleges, there is a strong tendency to detach from politics, using bourgeois educational methods for teaching, and rampant bourgeois individualism and artistic ideas. As a result, students cultivated with the money of the workers and peasants cannot serve the workers and peasants, "what is needed is not available, and what is available is not needed." After the anti-Rightist struggle, these decadent molds were swept away. However, they have not been completely eliminated.

    Now, in the wave of anti-waste and anti-conservatism that is shaking the country, art colleges have also caught up. They are exerting their energy and striving for the upper reaches, which is good news. We believe that the more profound significance of this leap forward and competition lies in combining art education with labor production and combining theory with practice. This will open a new chapter for our art education.

    Some people may doubt: Does this violate the "standardization" of education? There are also two types of standardization. The standardization of proletarian art education is the combination of art and politics, art serving politics, and education combined with labor production. The standardization of bourgeois art education is exactly the opposite. Only by implementing the "standardization" of combining teaching with labor production is it possible to cultivate truly Red and expert literary and art workers needed by socialism; while the bourgeois "standardization" of teaching detached from reality can only "create" empty artists who are appreciated by a few and despised by the majority.

    We will always follow the proletarian line of standardized art education.

    Opening a new situation requires determination, but also persistent perseverance. This time, at the meeting convened by the Ministry of Culture, the heads of various art colleges showed a new spirit and vigorous revolutionary drive, which is exciting. But this does not mean that there are no difficulties, especially that there will still be a lot of ideological resistance. I hope that all teachers and students of art colleges across the country will always be continuous revolutionaries in politics and innovators in art!

    打开艺术教育的新局面
    林碧
    要在文艺战线上建立一支又红又专的队伍，艺术院校是负有重大的责任的。当社会主义建设需要更多的文艺尖兵的时候，当整个社会对文化艺术的需求日益高涨的时候，我们究竟把怎样的一批人才送出学院的大门？这个问题，摆在所有艺术院校的面前，迫使它们的领导者作出回答。
    解放以来，我们的艺术教育有很大的成绩，为国家培养出大批艺术人才，他们分散在广泛的文化艺术战线上，是我们社会主义文艺事业的重要力量。但是，在艺术教育中也还存在着严重的问题，那就是在不少艺术院校中，有浓厚的脱离政治的倾向，用资产阶级的教育方法来进行教学，泛滥着资产阶级个人主义思想和艺术思想。结果就变成工农群众用钱培养出来的学生，却不能为工农服务，“要的没有，有的不要。”经过反右派斗争，这些腐朽的霉菌受到了扫荡。但是，也还没有完全清除。
    如今，在震荡全国的反浪费，反保守的浪潮中，艺术院校也赶上来了。他们鼓足干劲，力争上游，这是一个喜讯。我们认为，这个跃进和竞赛的更深远的意义，还在于使艺术教育与劳动生产相结合，使理论与实际相结合。从此为我们的艺术教育打开新的局面。
    有人会怀疑：这样是不是违反了教育的“正规化”？正规化也有两种。无产阶级艺术教育的正规化，就是艺术与政治结合，艺术服从政治，教育与劳动生产结合。而资产阶级艺术教育的正规化，恰好正相反。只有实行教学与劳动生产相结合的“正规化”，才有可能培养出真正为社会主义所需要的又红又专的文艺工作者；而资产阶级的教学与实际脱节的“正规化”，却只能“造就”出为少数人欣赏、为大多数人鄙弃的空头艺术家。
    我们永远遵循无产阶级的正规化艺术教育方针。
    打开新局面需要决心，但更需要坚持不懈的毅力。这次，在文化部召开的会议上，各艺术院校负责人都表现了新的气概和旺盛的革命干劲，这是令人兴奋的。但这不等于没有困难，特别是还会遇到不少思想上的阻力。希望全国艺术院校全体师生，永远做政治上的不断革命派和艺术上的革新派！
