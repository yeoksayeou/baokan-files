    Yuejin Brand Truck

    The Nanjing Automobile Manufacturing Plant trial-produced three Yuejin brand "CN130" trucks on the 14th. It is the second basic model truck made in China after the Jiefang brand truck. It will be formally produced in batches after passing the national appraisal.

    All parts and materials of the Yuejin brand "CN130" truck are domestically produced. Among the more than 2,000 parts and components, 551 are from 54 fraternal factories in Shanghai, Changchun, Jinan, Wuxi and other places. The characteristics of this car are that it is light and flexible, with a self-weight of only 2,700 kilograms, but the load capacity is not low. In addition to carrying 2.5 tons of goods on the body, it can also tow 3.5 tons of goods. It does not require high standards for roads and bridges, and can pass through areas where horse-drawn carriages can pass. In addition, it has a faster travel speed, low fuel consumption, and low cost.

    跃进牌载重汽车
    南京汽车制配厂在14日试制出三辆跃进牌“C N130”型载重汽车。它是继解放牌汽车之后我国自制的第二个基本型号的载重汽车，待国家鉴定合格以后便正式成批生产。
    跃进牌“C N130”型汽车的全部配件和材料都是国产。在两千多件零件和部件中，有五百五十一件是由上海、长春、济南、无锡等地五十四个兄弟工厂协作的。这种汽车的特点是，轻巧灵便，自重只有二千七百公斤，而装载量却不低，除了车身能装载两吨半的货物以外，还可以拖载三吨半货物。它对于公路、桥梁要求不高，凡马车能通过的地带都能通行。此外，行速较快，耗油量不大，造价低廉。
