Simple and Easy to Transform Slope Land into Terraced Fields; Ma Gengtian Creates the "Alternate Plowing and Turning Method"

(Our newspaper reports) According to the New Hunan Daily, an easy and practical method for transforming slope land into terraced fields, the "alternate plowing and turning method," has been created by Ma Gengtian, Secretary of the CPC Guzhang County Committee, and is being promoted among the masses throughout the county.

The "alternate plowing and turning method" involves plowing a strip of slope land two *zhang* wide, leaving a two *chi* wide strip unplowed, and then planting economic forests such as oil tea and tung trees on the unplowed strip. After three years, the slope land can be transformed into terraced fields, which can conserve water and soil, retain fertilizer, and promote the integration of grain and forestry.

This new method was initially tested by Ma Gengtian in January of this year at the Innovation Agricultural Cooperative in Guanba Township. This cooperative is located in a large mountainous area, where the slopes of most of the land are above 45 degrees. After the advanced cooperativization in 1955, the cooperative launched a campaign to transform slope land into terraced fields, using the method of transporting stones to build embankments. This method was labor-intensive and time-consuming, and in more than two years, the cooperative only transformed more than 20 *mu* of slope land.

Ma Gengtian believed that this was a common and directional problem in developing mountainous production, and he was determined to find a simple, easy, fast, and economical method to solve it. He went deep into the Innovation Cooperative to consult with experienced farmers. He combined the theories and experiences he had learned from documents with the wisdom and experience of the masses and proposed the idea of the "alternate plowing and turning method."

Ma Gengtian also conducted on-site experiments with the cooperative director, experienced farmers, and the work team stationed in the cooperative. During the experiment, they realized that plowing deeper could turn the terraced fields into slope land more quickly, so they decided to replace the six-inch plowshare with an eight-inch plowshare. After the experiment was successful, the cooperative promoted it on 65 *mu* of land within three days, and tung and tea trees were planted on the unplowed strips. The masses were very interested in this new method, calling it "retaining the base embankment" and "retaining the platform," and decided to expand the cooperative's task of transforming terraced fields this year from the original plan of 50 *mu* to 500 *mu*.

The Guzhang County Committee has decided to fully promote this plowing method, starting with water management…

By the 18th of this month, Anhui Province had completed 3.2 billion cubic meters of earthwork in water conservancy projects. The more than 2 million completed projects alone will enable nearly half of the province's cultivated land to improve irrigation and be protected from flooding. More than 6 million *mu* of dry land in Huaibei will be converted into paddy fields this year, more than five times the amount last year. This fully demonstrates the great spirit and revolutionary drive of the revolutionary people!

Chairman Mao told us in "On Practice": "In the struggle to change objective reality, man changes his own subjective world as well—changes his cognitive ability and changes the relations between the subjective and the objective world." The broad masses of cadres and people in Anhui Province, in the process of building water conservancy projects, are transforming nature and their own subjective understanding. Through this practice, they have mastered a great deal of knowledge about transforming nature and further recognized their own strength. This is an even greater gain.

The change in production relations brings unlimited prospects for the development of productive forces. This is an objective fact. However, people often cannot deeply understand this point without personally participating in practice. The initial plan for Anhui Province last autumn was to complete only 400 million cubic meters of earthwork. This was already a high demand at the time. However, after a period of practice, the Provincial Party Committee quickly realized that the target was set too low and raised it to 800 million cubic meters. But the result of mobilizing the masses to take action was that it was completed in just over two months. When people saw that groundwater was springing up everywhere on the Huaibei Plain as a result of their labor, allowing them to plant a large amount of rice, and when they saw that many places in Huainan and Jiangnan could really be quickly freed from drought and flood disasters, their horizons were greatly broadened and their enthusiasm was even greater. The water conservancy construction targets were raised again and again, and now they have tripled, equivalent to completing eight times the original plan. And the water conservancy construction work is still continuing to develop. People have naturally concluded from repeated practice that as long as they recognize the long-term construction vision, are determined to work hard, the water conservancy construction work can be done more, faster, better, and more economically.

Having gained this understanding in the practice of water conservancy construction, the spiritual outlook of the people of Anhui Province has greatly changed. They have firm confidence in whatever they do. The Party called on them to use the spirit of water management to accumulate fertilizer, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated quickly tripled. The Party called on them to use the spirit of water management to green Anhui, and the speed of greening tripled. The Party called on them to use the spirit of water management to eliminate the four pests and develop local industries, and these two tasks are also advancing by leaps and bounds. The changes in the understanding of cadres and the masses (the subjective world) have given new impetus to all aspects of work in Anhui Province. And the rapid progress in all aspects of work is bound to push the consciousness and understanding of the people of Anhui to a new height.

From the beginning of water conservancy construction last winter, the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee and party committees at all levels emphasized the principle of relying on the masses and managing water thriftily, and put forward construction methods suitable to local conditions according to the characteristics of different regions. During the movement, they also promptly raised issues such as paying attention to quality and improving tools, and promptly organized visits and comparisons. With the development of the movement, new goals were repeatedly put forward, inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and pushing the movement forward again and again. When achievements were made in water management, they proposed to use the enthusiasm of water management to do a good job in other aspects, so that these tasks could advance in unison. The fundamental reason why Anhui Province has been able to successfully lead the people of the province in achieving great victories in all aspects is that they have established the idea of believing in and relying on the masses, and can put forward new slogans and revise their plans at any time according to the developed situation, which makes the movement able to develop forward without stopping, one peak after another. This kind of leadership method is the leadership method of the true revolutionary promoter. This is the leadership method needed by the revolutionary people of the whole country and the entire socialist cause.

### 坡土改梯土简便易行  马耕田创造“隔犁翻土法”

    坡土改梯土简便易行
    马耕田创造“隔犁翻土法”
    本报讯　据新湖南报报道：一种简便易行的改坡土为梯土的“隔犁翻土法”，由中共古丈县委书记马耕田创造出来，并正在全县群众中推广。
    “隔犁翻土法”，就是在坡土上横耕两丈宽时，隔下两尺宽不犁，然后在隔犁的坡带上种植油茶油桐等经济林。如此经过三年，就能使坡土变成梯土，既能保持水土保住肥料，又推行了粮林结合。
    这种新办法，是马耕田今年1月在官坝乡革新农业社试创的。这个社位于大山区，一般坡土的坡度在四十五度以上。1955年高级合作化以后，社里曾掀起一个改坡土为梯土的运动，当时采取的是运石砌坎的办法。这种办法比较花工费时，两年多来全社只改了二十多亩坡土。
    马耕田认为这是发展山区生产中一个普遍的带有方向性的问题，决心想出一种简便易行多快好省的办法来解决这个问题。他深入到革新社向老农请教。他把从文件上学来的理论、经验同群众的智慧、经验相结合，提出了“隔犁翻土法”的意见。
    马耕田又同社主任、老农以及驻社工作组干部作了实地试验，试验中体会到如能犁得更深些，能更快地把梯土变成坡土，决定把六寸犁铧改为八寸犁铧。试验成功后，全社在三天内推广了六十五亩，并且在隔犁的坡带上都栽上了桐茶林。群众对这个新办法很感兴趣，他们把这个办法称作“留基坎”“留台台”，决定把全社今年改梯土的任务由原订计划五十亩扩大到五百亩。
    古丈县委决定全面推广这个翻土法。从治水开始……

    安徽省到本月18日止，已经做了三十二亿土方的水利工程。单是已完工的二百多万处工程，就能使全省近一半的耕地改善灌溉，受到灌溉和免除涝灾。淮北有六百多万亩旱地今年就要改成水稻田，比去年增加五倍多。这里充分表现了革命人民的伟大气魄和革命干劲！
    毛主席在“实践论”中告诉我们：“改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界——改造自己的认识能力，改造主观世界同客观世界的关系。”安徽省的广大干部和群众，正是在兴修水利中改造了自然，也改造了自己的主观认识。他们通过这一实践，掌握了许多改造自然的知识，也进一步认识了自己的力量。这是一个更大的收获。
    生产关系的改变，给生产力的发展带来无限的远景。这是客观的事实。但人们在没有亲身参加实践的时候，往往不能深刻地认识这点。安徽省去年秋天最初的计划，只是做四亿多土方的工程。这在当时就是很高的要求了。可是，经过一段实践，省委很快就看到指标订低了，于是把它提高到八亿土方。但是发动群众行动的结果，只用两个多月就完成了。当人们看到经过自己的劳动，淮北大平原上到处冒出了地下水，可以大量改种水稻的时候，当人们看到淮南江南的许多地方真的可以很快免除旱涝灾害的时候，眼界便大大开阔了，干劲也更大了。兴修水利的指标一提再提，到现在已经翻了三翻，等于完成了最初计划的八倍。而目前水利兴修工作仍在继续发展。人们从反复的实践中自然地得出了结论：只要认清建设远景，下定决心苦干，兴修水利工作就能够作到多快好省。
    在兴修水利的实践中得到了这个认识，安徽省人民的精神面貌大大改变了。不管做什么，都有了坚定的信心。党号召以治水的精神来积肥，积肥的数量便很快翻了三翻。党号召以治水的精神绿化安徽，绿化的速度便加快了三倍。党号召以治水的精神除四害和发展地方工业，这两项工作也在飞跃前进了。干部和人民群众认识上（主观世界）的变化，使安徽省各方面的工作都得到了新的动力。而各方面工作的飞跃进展，又势必把安徽人民的觉悟和认识推到新的高度。
    中共安徽省委和各级党委，从去冬兴修水利一开始，便强调了依靠群众勤俭治水的方针，并按照不同地区的特点提出了适合当地的兴修方法。在运动中又及时地提出重视质量，改进工具等问题，及时组织参观评比。随着运动的发展，一次再次地提出了新的奋斗目标，鼓起群众革命干劲，把运动一再推向前进。在治水工作取得成绩时，又提出以治水的干劲做好其他各方面工作，使这些工作齐头跃进。安徽省所以能成功地领导全省人民在各方面取得伟大的胜利，根本原因是他们树立了相信群众、依靠群众的思想，能够随时根据发展了的情况提出新的口号，订正自己的计划，这就使得运动能够一个高峰接着一个高峰永不停息地向前发展。这样的领导方法，是真正的革命的促进派的领导方法。这是全国革命人民和整个社会主义事业所需要的领导方法。
