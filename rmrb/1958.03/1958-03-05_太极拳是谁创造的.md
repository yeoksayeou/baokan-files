    Who Created Taijiquan?

    Who exactly created Taijiquan? In the past, some people believed that Taijiquan was created by Zhang Sanfeng at the end of the Northern Song Dynasty. According to further investigation, the creator of Taijiquan was Chen Wangting of Chenjiagou, Wen County, Henan Province, during the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties. However, upon closer examination, Taijiquan was not solely created by Chen Wangting. A significant portion of his Taijiquan stances were derived from the "Boxing Classic" written by Qi Jiguang of the Ming Dynasty and other boxing styles of the time. Qi Jiguang's "Boxing Classic" was also compiled based on sixteen well-known boxing styles of that era. Therefore, in reality, Taijiquan is the crystallization of the wisdom of generations of the masses.
    The Taijiquan created by Chen Wangting was passed down to the fifteenth generation. Yang Luchan of Yongnian, Hebei Province, learned the Chen family's Taijiquan. Yang brought Taijiquan to Beijing. Later, Yang Chengfu, a descendant of Yang Luchan, made some modifications to the original Taijiquan based on needs, finally shaping it into the famous Yang style. The Yang style of Taijiquan has simple, graceful, and generous movements, combining lightness and steadiness. It is easy to develop skill through practice and is also suitable for medical and health exercises, so it is the most widely spread. The simplified Taijiquan compiled and printed by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission is adapted from Yang Chengfu's style. The Chen family's old style is complex and difficult to practice, requiring a large amount of exercise. Currently, most people practice Taijiquan for healing and health purposes, and they mostly prefer to practice gentle forms, so the Chen style is not as widely spread as the Yang style.
    In addition, there is the Wu style created by Wu Yuxiang, the Wu style created by Wu Quanyou and Wu Jianquan, and the Sun style created by Sun Lutang. Except for the Wu style, the others are not very widely spread.

    太极拳是谁创造的
    古心
    太极拳究竟是谁创造的？过去有人认为太极拳是北宋末年张三峰创造的，据进一步调查，创造太极拳的是明末清初河南温县陈家沟的陈王廷。但仔细追索起来，太极拳也并非陈王廷一人独创，他的太极拳中有很大一部分式子是取自明朝戚继光所撰写的“拳经”和当时其他拳法。而戚继光的“拳经”也是根据当时十六家著名拳法编成的。因此，实际上太极拳是几代群众创造的结晶。
    陈王廷创的太极拳传到第十五代，河北永年的杨露禅学了陈家的太极拳。杨把太极拳传到了北京。后来，杨露禅的后代杨澄甫根据需要把原来的太极拳又作了一些修改，最后定型，成了著名的杨派。杨派太极拳的拳式简洁、舒展、大方，轻灵沉着，兼而有之，练起来容易长功力，也适合作医疗体育，所以流传最广。现在国家体委编印的简化太极拳，就是根据杨澄甫架改编成的。陈家的老架复杂难练，运动量很大。目前绝大多数人练太极拳都是为疗病和保健，大多喜欢练舒缓的拳套，故陈派流传反不如杨派广。
    另外，还有武禹襄创的武派，吴全佑、吴鉴泉创的吴派，孙禄堂创的孙派等。这几派除去吴派外，其余的流传都不太广泛。
