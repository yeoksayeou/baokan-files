    Gaseous Petroleum – Biogas
    Hong Zhi
    According to reports, Anhui Province plans to use hydropower and biogas for electricity generation, aiming to achieve electrification within five years. Scientific workers in Hubei Province also successfully researched the use of manure to produce biogas as fuel as early as last year. This is truly good news in the great leap forward of agriculture.
    Biogas, this cheap and easy-to-use gas, can be used for lighting, cooking, and heating. It can also be used to generate electricity, providing sufficient power for water conservancy projects and farmland irrigation.
    Often, we can see many bubbles emerging from the silt in ponds and swamps. This is methane—biogas—produced by the fermentation of fibrous materials such as weeds and tree roots in the pond in the absence of air by bacteria. Biogas is a colorless, odorless gas lighter than air. When it burns in air or oxygen, it emits a blue flame with a high temperature. Biogas can be used as fuel, so some people call it "gaseous petroleum."
    Similarly, biogas can be produced from manure. The main components of manure are cellulose and undigested starch, protein, etc. These substances, when subjected to bacterial action in the absence of oxygen, produce methane. Not only manure, but anything containing cellulose, such as leaves, wood shavings, sawdust, straw, sorghum stalks, corncobs, bean pods, bean winnows, etc., can be used to produce large amounts of biogas. If the supply of manure is limited, leaves and weeds are not difficult to find.
    If manure is used as a raw material for biogas production, will there be less manure fertilizer? No. Manure is used as fertilizer because it contains nitrides and phosphides, which crops absorb to grow better. However, crops do not need the carbides such as cellulose in manure. If manure is first used to produce biogas, it just turns the carbides that are useless to crops into useful fuel, while the nitrogen and phosphorus compounds that are beneficial to crops remain in the fermented manure residue. Therefore, using manure to produce fuel simply turns what would have been wasted into useful fuel and does not affect the fertilizer effect of the manure. On the contrary, because manure ferments, most of the non-fertilizer substances are released as gas, and the application effect of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other components in the residue is greatly increased.
    Soviet scientists have also calculated that if a livestock farm has 200 dairy cows and 50 pigs, fermenting the collected manure can produce 1,000 cubic meters of biogas per day. This biogas can solve the heat energy and electricity needed by the breeding station in winter, and can enable 200 households in the farm to use biogas for cooking; in addition, the farm can also get 10,000 tons of highly effective fertilizer every year. In addition to livestock manure, agricultural cooperatives can also make full use of leaves, weeds, potato stems and leaves, garbage, etc. to produce biogas. Therefore, the raw materials for biogas are truly inexhaustible!

    气体石油——沼气
    鸿志
    报载安徽省计划利用水力和沼气发电，在五年内实现电气化。湖北省的科学工作者也早在去年就研究成功了用粪便制造沼气来当燃料。这真是农业大跃进中的好消息。
    沼气，这又便宜、使用起来又简便的气体，人们可以用它来点灯、烧饭和取暖，还可以用它来发电，让兴修水利和灌溉耕地时能够得到足够的动力。
    常常，我们可以看见在池沼的淤泥里，冒出许多气泡。那是由于池塘里的杂草、树根等纤维物质，在缺乏空气的情况下，受到细菌的发酵作用后产生的甲烷——沼气。沼气是一种没有颜色、没有气味、比空气轻的气体，在空气中或氧气中燃烧时，发出蓝色火焰，温度很高。沼气可以作为燃料，所以有人称它为“气体石油”。
    同样道理，可以用粪便来制造沼气。粪便里的主要成分是一些纤维素和没有被消化的淀粉、蛋白质等，这些东西，在氧气供应缺乏的时候，受到细菌的作用就产生了甲烷。不仅是粪便，凡是含有纤维素的东西，如树叶、碎木屑、锯末、稻草、高粱秸、玉米棒、豆荚、豆箕……等都可以制造出大量的沼气来。假如粪便的供应还是有限的话，树叶、杂草却是不难找到的。
    粪便作了制造沼气的原料后，是不是粪肥就会变少了呢？不会。用粪便作肥料，是因为粪里含有氮化物、磷化物，庄稼吸取了这些氮和磷的化合物就能长得更好。但是，粪里的纤维素等碳化物，庄稼是不需要的。如果先用粪去制造沼气，恰好是把那对庄稼没有用的碳化物，变成了有用的燃料，而对庄稼有益的氮、磷化合物仍然留在发酵以后的粪便残渣里。所以用粪来制造燃料，只是把原来要被浪费掉的东西变成了有用的燃料，并不影响粪便的肥效。相反地，由于粪便发酵，把大部分不是肥料的东西都变成气体放出了，残渣里的氮、磷等成分的应用效果大大增加。
    苏联的科学家还计算过，假如在一个畜牧社里有二百头乳牛和五十口猪，那么用收集起来的畜粪发酵，每天就可以生成一千立方公尺的沼气。这些沼气，可以解决饲养站在冬天所需的热能和电力，可以使这个农庄有二百户居民用沼气烧火；此外，这个社每年还可以得到一万吨高效力的肥料。除了畜粪外，在农业社里，还可以充分利用树叶、杂草马铃薯的茎叶、垃圾等来制造沼气，因此，沼气的原料可真是取之不尽、用之不竭！
