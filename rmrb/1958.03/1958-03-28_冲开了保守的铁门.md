Bursting Through the Iron Gate of Conservatism
By our reporters Zhang Jing and Yue E

The news that the entire journey time for passenger and freight trains from Shanghai to Nanjing had been shortened by one hour and nine minutes, starting from 18:00 on March 3rd, was met with joyous excitement!

Behind this heartening news, there had also been a fierce ideological struggle, which took place within Comrade Yu Naixin of the Nanjing Engineering Section. He is the head of the Nanjing Engineering Section of the Shanghai Railway Administration.

First, it is necessary to explain one thing: the key to shortening train travel time and increasing vehicle speed lies in increasing the speed of trains passing through switches (points). Regarding the speed of passing through switches, the Ministry of Railways has strict regulations: the straight direction cannot exceed 70 kilometers per hour, and the diverging direction cannot exceed 30 kilometers per hour. As early as 1952 and 1956, workers had already proposed revising these regulations and increasing the speed of passing through switches, but no one paid attention. Workers in the work zones and comrades in the engineering section had also engaged in debates about this issue, but in the end, advanced operating targets still had to be limited by these regulations.

This year, the first raging fire of anti-waste and anti-conservatism was directed at the issue of switch speeds. Drivers were determined to haul more and run faster, demanding that the engineering section quickly decide to increase the speed of passing through switches. Many dazibao (big-character posters) in the work zones fiercely attacked the engineering section for its inaction. Workers in the switch work zones expressed their determination to raise the straight-direction switch speed from 70 kilometers to 80 kilometers, and the diverging-direction speed from 30 kilometers to 40 kilometers. Some even proposed targets of 90 kilometers and 45 kilometers respectively.

Despite the high call from the masses, Yu Naixin, the head of the engineering section, using the 4517 type No. 12 switch's diverging speed as an example, believed that the maximum speed allowed was only 32.3 kilometers. Although the Soviet Union also had speeds reaching 80 and 40 kilometers, their switches were made of 50-kilogram manganese steel, and the point rails were specially designed. How could they be compared? And the highest domestic target was only 70 and 30 kilometers. Since there was no international precedent and no theoretical basis could be found, how could they act rashly and risk the lives and property of the state and the people? At this time, many terrible accidents that he had often heard about in school more than a decade ago flashed through his mind one after another: why did a bridge in London suddenly collapse? Why did a water tower designed by a famous Japanese engineer collapse? Thinking of this, Yu Naixin broke out in a cold sweat and decided: no matter how much you yell, I know what's in my heart. Therefore, whether in meetings or in individual conversations with others, he always talked eloquently about that set of outdated theoretical bases and often used this to ask the workers in return: "What is the theoretical basis for the leap forward targets you have proposed?"

However, the enthusiasm of the masses for the Great Leap Forward could no longer be suppressed. Some drivers said, "No matter what, the speed of passing through switches has actually already been exceeded, and we have to consider breaking with convention!" Track maintenance workers also suggested, "The diverging passing speed of some switches has already reached over 40 kilometers, and for some switches, you can even drive over the speed limit with your eyes closed." Although the workers had no way to find any theoretical basis, they respected the facts. Therefore, they also asked Yu Naixin in return: "For the fact that the speed limit prescribed by the theoretical formula has already been exceeded in practice, what theoretical explanation do you have for this situation?"

The facts before him and the increasingly urgent demands of the masses forced Yu Naixin to rethink. At the general branch committee of the Party and the enlarged meeting of all cadres of the engineering section, most comrades also believed that the 80 and 40 targets were not a problem. Only then, encouraged by everyone, did Yu Naixin express his agreement. However, when he later learned that the targets proposed by other work sections were not so high, he felt somewhat remorseful again. He thought: after all, a speed of 40 kilometers is an isolated phenomenon, and theory is theory. He felt uneasy again.

A few days later, Yu Naixin, with a heavy and confused mood, went to Shanghai to attend an enlarged meeting of cadres of the Railway Bureau. On the train, two questions were constantly swirling in his mind: was I conservative, or were the masses being rash?

At this time, he saw Ji Songling, the Deputy Party Secretary of the Nanjing area of the Railway Bureau, who was traveling with him. As soon as Yu Naixin saw Ji Songling, he brought up the topic of switch speeds.

"To be honest, I'm still very unsure about this. The regulations on switch speeds were determined by summing up the experience of predecessors many times and estimating various accidental factors. This time, we have negated it with a single guarantee. I always feel uneasy," Yu Naixin frankly revealed his hesitant and uneasy emotions to the Party Secretary.

"I don't object to your cautious attitude towards this issue. The problem now is that the masses have already exceeded the theoretical regulations in their own practice. What do we do? Do we believe in the masses, or do we blindly believe in theory?" Ji Songling's words immediately touched on the crux of the problem. His point of view was precisely the doubt that Yu Naixin had been unable to resolve in these days.

"You're right, the problem that is perplexing me right now is precisely this. I can neither use theory to further prove the practice of the masses, nor do I have any reason to refute the practice of the masses. I am neither willing to lag behind nor do I have sufficient basis to break with the old conventions," Yu Naixin continued.

"Perhaps the difference between the promoters and the retarders lies here. For us technical personnel, the task of the promoters is to help the masses summarize their practical experience at any time, and use it to enrich and supplement their theoretical knowledge, so as to better guide the practice of the masses; while the retarders are just the opposite. They intentionally or unintentionally use outdated theories to limit the practice of the masses, and they themselves shackle the hands and feet of the masses, but they are still saying that others are rash. Lao Yu, don't you think so?"…

The two talked very congenially, and before they knew it, the train had arrived at Changzhou Station, and Ji Songling got off the train for some business. Yu Naixin reflected on the words they had talked about, and only then did he begin to realize that he had unconsciously become a prisoner of old rules and regulations. Because he blindly believed in old theories, he ignored the living practice of the masses and even intentionally or unintentionally used theory to limit practice. In this case, the prudence and responsibility that he had always emphasized in the past had become a shield for conservatism and backwardness. Thinking of this, Yu Naixin's mind suddenly cleared up.

The train continued to move forward, and Yu Naixin felt much more relaxed at this time, but he couldn't calm down no matter what. A new question became active in his mind: the leap forward guarantee has been put forward, what measures should be taken to achieve it? He went to consult with Wang Chengxiang, an old track maintenance worker traveling on the same train. He said, "Lao Wang, we are all Communist Party members. Do you think this guarantee to increase the speed of passing through switches is sure to be achieved? You are older and have more experience. Tell me, do you feel confident?"

Wang Chengxiang had a lot of experience, but he never talked nonsense. This time, he said with great certainty, "In my opinion, there is no problem in achieving the target of 80 kilometers straight and 40 kilometers diverging. I remember when the Japanese devils were here, I was in Guandong at that time. There were no limits on driving. They drove as fast as they wanted. Once, the wind pipe of a locomotive broke, and the train couldn't brake. Watching it rush down a slope, the diverging speed was at least seventy or eighty kilometers. The wheels were all flying up, and the things on the train were shaking all over the place, but the train didn't overturn. That was really dangerous!" Wang Chengxiang spoke so vividly that Yu Naixin was stunned. Then Wang Chengxiang said, "Of course, that was a dangerous situation, and we can't take it as an example. But now, the diverging speed we are proposing is only 40 kilometers. Usually, speeds like this are common."

Yu Naixin usually trusted this old worker very much. He was conscientious and responsible in his work and never did anything without certainty. Now, hearing him say this, Yu Naixin felt even more enlightened. The door of conservatism, which had been confined by old theories, was finally opened.

After returning from Shanghai, Yu Naixin kicked away conservative ideas and immediately organized a switch speed research team of more than ten people, including old workers and technicians, and began to conduct detailed on-the-spot investigations and theoretical discussions.

Before the Spring Festival, at six sets of switches in Zhenjiang, Pukou, Yaohuamen and other places, the researchers stayed at both ends of the switches day and night, conducting more than 160 switch speed tests. The test results showed that not only had the switch speed exceeded the leap forward target of 80 kilometers straight and 40 kilometers diverging more than 70 times, but also high switch speeds of 45 kilometers diverging and 90 kilometers straight had appeared. These data are the basis for increasing the switch speed. What theoretical basis could be more powerful and sufficient than these practical data?

Naturally, to increase the switch speed, there is a series of technical problems. One day, Yu Naixin, with the attitude of asking the workers for advice, went to the work zone alone. Along the way, he discussed a question with the switchmen, patrolmen, and track maintenance workers he met: After the switch speed is increased, will the switch parts wear out too seriously, and can the maintenance keep up?

"If the speed is increased, the wear of the switch will naturally increase relatively. However, increasing the speed is definitely not the main reason for the wear and replacement of parts. On the line, if the switch is well maintained, it will not break down for more than a year; some switches that are not well maintained will have to be replaced in three months." Then, he inspected the wear of some switches on the spot and confirmed the truths that the workers said, and felt more at ease.

After ten days of on-the-spot investigation, interviews, and measurements, Yu Naixin's conservative ideas were completely shattered. The measured data helped Yu Naixin and the engineering technicians of the engineering section to further explore the theoretical issues of switch speed. After this discussion, he boldly proposed to achieve the leap forward target of 45 kilometers diverging and 90 kilometers straight before May Day.

After this struggle, Yu Naixin realized the truth that theory comes from practice and then turns around to guide practice. He said, "I have been away from school for twelve years, and this is the first time I have explored theory in this way."

    冲开了保守的铁门
    本报记者　张竞　越峨
    从3月3日十八时开始，上海到南京的客货列车全程运行时间，缩短了一小时零九分，消息传来，谁不为之欢腾鼓舞！
    在这个鼓舞人心的消息后面，也曾经有过一场激烈的思想斗争，这场斗争发生在南京工务段俞乃新同志的身上，他是上海铁路管理局南京工务段的段长。
    在这里先要交代一件事：缩短列车运行时间，提高车辆行驶速度的关键在于提高列车经过道岔的速度。关于过岔速度，铁道部曾有严格规定：直向不能超过七十公里，侧向不能超过三十公里。早在1952年和1956年已经有工人提出修改这个规章、提高过岔速度的要求，但没有人理睬。工区的工人和工务段的同志也曾为此展开过争论，结果先进的运行指标仍不得不受这个规定的限制。
    今年反浪费、反保守的第一把烈火，就烧到了过岔速度的问题上来。司机们决心多拉、快跑，要求工务段赶快决定提高过岔速度。许多工区的大字报都猛攻工务段为什么没有动静。道岔工区的工人表示坚决要把过岔速度直向由七十公里提高到八十公里，侧向由三十公里提高到四十公里。有人还提出了九十公里与四十五公里的指标。
    尽管群众的呼声这样高，可是工务段段长俞乃新却以4517型十二号道岔侧向速度为例，认为最高速度只允许跑三十二点三公里。苏联虽也有达到八十、四十公里的，但人家是五十公斤的锰钢道岔，尖轨是特别设计的，怎么能比？而国内最高的指标也只是七十、三十公里。既然国际上没有先例，理论上又找不到根据，怎么能轻举盲动，拿着国家人民的生命财产去冒险呢？这时，十几年前在学校里经常听到的许多可怕的事故，又一幕一幕在脑子里闪过：英国伦敦有一座大桥为什么突然垮了呢？日本一位著名的工程师设计的一个水塔为什么倒塌了呢？一想到这里，俞乃新身上就直冒冷汗，他决定：任凭你们吆喝，反正我心中有数。于是，他不论是在会议上，或者是与别人个别交谈时，总是振振有词地谈论着那套早已陈旧了的理论根据，而且常常以此来反问工人：“你们提出的跃进指标有什么理论根据呢？”
    可是，工人群众大跃进的积极性已经再也按耐不下去了。有些司机说：“不管怎么样，过岔速度实际上早已超过了，我们就得考虑打破常规！”养路工人也提出：“一部分道岔的侧向过岔速度早已达到四十公里以上，有些道岔甚至闭着眼睛开车也能超速。”工人们虽然没有办法找什么理论根据，可是他们是尊重事实的，因此他们也反问俞乃新：“对于实际上早已超过了理论公式所规定的限速，对这种情况，你在理论上又作何解释呢？”
    摆在面前的事实，和愈逼愈紧的群众要求，使俞乃新不得不重新思考了。在党的总支委员会和全工务段的干部扩大会议上，多数同志也认为八十、四十这个指标没有问题，俞乃新这才在大家鼓舞下表示了同意。可是当事后他了解到其他工段提的指标都没有这样高的时候，他又有些懊悔了。他想：四十公里的速度毕竟是个别现象，理论毕竟是理论。心里又七上八下地不安起来。
    几天之后，俞乃新怀着沉重的困惑的心情，到上海去参加铁路局的干部扩大会。在火车上，脑子里还始终盘旋着两个问号，究竟是我保守，还是群众冒进？
    这时，他看到了和他同行的铁路局南京区的分党委书记季松岭。俞乃新一见季松岭来，就把话题拉到过岔速度上来了。
    “说实话，我现在心里还是玄的很，过岔速度的规定，是总结了前人多少次的经验，估计了各种不同的偶然因素才定下来的，我们这次一个保证就把它否定了，总觉得放不下心来。”俞乃新很坦率地向党委书记透露了自己这种犹豫不安的情绪。
    “你对这问题的慎重态度我并不反对，现在的问题是群众已经在自己的实践中超过了理论上的规定，我们怎么办？是相信群众呢？还是迷信理论？”季松岭这句话一下子就触到了问题的关键，他这个观点，恰恰就是俞乃新在这些日子里百思而不解的疑团。
    “你说对了，眼前使我困惑的正就是这个问题，我既不能用理论去进一步证明群众的实践，更加没有理由去驳倒群众的实践，我既不甘心落后，又没有足够的根据去打破旧的陈规。”俞乃新接着说。
    “也许促进派和促退派的分歧就在这里吧。对于我们技术人员来说，促进派的任务是随时帮助群众把他们的实践经验总结起来，并且用它去丰富和充实自己的理论知识，从而更好地指导群众的实践；而促退派恰恰相反，他们有意无意地用过时的理论去限制群众的实践，自己束缚了群众的手脚，却还在说别人冒进。老俞，你说是不是？”………
    两个人你一言我一句谈得很投机，不觉列车已到了常州站，季松岭有事下车去了。俞乃新回味着他们谈的那些话，这才开始觉察到自己已经不自觉地做了陈规旧章的俘虏。因为过于迷信旧的理论，却忽视了群众的活生生的实践，甚至也在有意无意地用理论去限制实践。在这种情况下，平时一贯强调的慎重负责也变成了保守落后的护身符。想到这里，俞乃新的思想才豁然开朗了起来。
    列车继续前进，俞乃新这时的心情感到轻松多了，可是无论如何平静不下来。在他脑子里又活跃起一个新的问题：跃进的保证提出去了，应该采取什么办法去实现呢？他又去找同路的老养路工人王呈祥商量。他说：“老王，我们都是共产党员，你看这次提高过岔速度的保证有没有把握实现？你年纪大经历得多，你说说看，你心里有底不？”
    王呈祥是经历得多了，可从来也不说疯话。这次却很有把握地说：“依我看要实现直向八十，侧向四十的指标没有问题。记得日本鬼子在的时候，我那时在关外，开车的就没有什么限度，爱开多快就多快，有一次一列机车的风管坏了，车了刹不住，看着它一个下坡闯下去，侧向速度起码有七八十公里，车轮子都飞起来了，车上的东西晃得满地，可是车子还没有翻，那一次可真是危险啦！”王呈祥说得活龙活现的，简直把俞乃新都听呆了。接着王呈祥又说：“当然，那一次是险车，不能拿它为例。可是，现在我们提的侧向速度不过是四十公里，平时像这样的速度也是常有的事。”
    俞乃新平时是很相信这个老工人的，他工作认真负责，从来不做没有把握的事，如今听他这么一说，俞乃新心里更亮堂了。原来被旧的理论困守着的保守之门，现在总算打开了。
    从上海回来后，俞乃新踢开了保守思想，立即组织了十多人的包括老工人、技术人员参加的道岔速度研究小组，着手进行细致的实地调查和理论探讨工作。
    春节之前，在镇江、浦口、尧化门等地的六组道岔上，研究组的工作人员日夜守候在道岔的两端，进行了一百六十多次过岔速度测试。测试的结果表明，不仅有七十次以上的过岔速度都超过了直向八十公里、侧向四十公里这个跃进了的指标，而且还出现了侧达到四十五公里、直向九十公里的过岔高速度。这些资料就是提高过岔速度的根据，还有什么理论根据能比这些实际资料更有力更充分呢？
    自然，要提高过岔速度，还有一系列的技术问题。一天，俞乃新抱着向工人请教的态度，一个人到工区去了。一路之上，他和遇到的扳道工、巡路工、养路工共同商量一个问题：过岔速度提高之后，道岔零件会不会磨损太严重，维修能不能跟上去？
      “速度提高了，道岔磨损自然相对地加大了。但是，提高速度绝对不是零件磨损更换的主要原因。在线路上，道岔养护得好，使用一年多不坏；有些道岔养护得不好，三个月就要更换一个”。接着，他在现场检查了一些道岔的磨损情况，证实了工人们所说的这些道理，更加放心了。
    经过十天的实地调查、访问和测定，俞乃新的保守思想被彻底粉碎了。测定的资料又帮助俞乃新和工务段的工程技术人员们进一步探讨了过岔速度的理论问题。经过这一番探讨，他勇敢地提出了要在五一节前达到侧向四十五公里，直向九十公里的跃进指标。
    经过这一场斗争，俞乃新才体会到理论来自实践，又回过头来指导实践的真理。他说：“我离开学校十二年了，像这样来探讨理论还是第一次。”
