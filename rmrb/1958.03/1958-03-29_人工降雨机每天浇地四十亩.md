Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, March 28th: The newly created "artificial rainmaking machine" attracted the attention of all visitors at the agricultural tool improvement appraisal and promotion meeting in the Tianshui Special District. When the testing personnel shook the rainmaking machine, the water in the canal was sucked up onto the four or five-zhang-high slope, sprinkling across the wheat fields sprouting tender seedlings at a rate of irrigating one mu every ten minutes, delivering a sudden rainfall of 86.8 millimeters. Hundreds of visiting farmers and cadres praised it endlessly. The CPC Tianshui Prefectural Committee attaches great importance to this creation suitable for irrigating mountainous and sloping land and has decided to vigorously promote it throughout the region.

The artificial rainmaking machine was created by Jiang Yunzhong, a worker at the Gangu Farm Implement Factory. He was originally a county cadre from a metalworking background who, after being transferred to the farm implement factory to participate in production last year, actively engaged in farm implement reform work. The artificial rainmaking machine was made by him using the principle of the old-fashioned hand-cranked fire engine. A leather hose (or canvas hose) is connected to each end of the machine body, one end inserted into the water, and a sprinkler head is installed on the other end of the hose. Two people shake the handle, and one person raises the nozzle, and the water sprays out in the direction the person is pointing. The maximum lift of this artificial rainmaking machine is 20 meters, and it can irrigate about 40 mu of land per day. At the same time, it saves more than half the water compared to gravity-fed irrigation.

The artificial rainmaking machine is easy to carry, simple to manufacture, and the machine body only needs three sections of cast iron pipe with a diameter of just over two inches and a length of one and a half feet, making it inexpensive to produce. All the sloping land that cannot be irrigated by channels, ponds, dams, and cellars can use it. More than 30 artificial rainmaking machines manufactured by the Gangu Farm Implement Factory have already been sold to agricultural cooperatives for spring irrigation, and the results are very good. The factory has now accepted a large number of orders.

    人工降雨机每天浇地四十亩
    新华社兰州28日电　在天水专区农业工具改进鉴定推广会议上，新创制的“人工降雨机”吸引了所有参观者的注意。当试验人员摇动降雨机的时候，渠里的水被吸上四、五丈高的坡地上，以每十分钟浇一亩地的速度，降八十六点八公厘的骤雨量，洒遍了吐出嫩苗的麦地。几百个参观的农民、干部个个道好不绝。中共天水地委十分重视这项适于山地和坡地灌溉的创造，决定在全区大力推广。
    人工降雨机是甘谷农具厂工人蒋蕴中创造的。他原是铁工出身的县干部，去年下放农具厂参加生产以后，便积极从事农具改革工作。人工降雨机是他利用旧式人摇救火机的原理制成的。在机身两端各接上一根皮管（或帆布管），一头插在水里，另一头的皮管上装置一个莲蓬头。两人摇动扶手，一人举起喷口，水便朝着人所指向的方向喷洒出去。这种人工降雨机的最大扬程是二十公尺，每天能浇地四十亩左右。同时，比自流水灌溉要节约用水一半还多。
    人工降雨机携带轻便，制造简单，机身只需用直径两寸多的一尺五寸长的生铁管三截，成本低廉，凡是渠塘坝窖灌不到的山坡地都可以使用。甘谷农具厂制造的三十多部人工降雨机，已经卖给农业社用来春灌，效果很好。现在这个工厂已经接受大量订货。
