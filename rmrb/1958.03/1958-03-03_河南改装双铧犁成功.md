Xinhua News Agency report: Henan's Xichuan and Deng counties have successfully modified double-wheel double-share plows, and the results of the experiments are good. The modified double-wheel double-share plow, when pulled by two ordinary livestock, can plow ten mu of land per day, an increase of 30% over the effect before the modification.

The modification methods are: (1) Move the front plow blade from the outside to the inside, narrowing the width of the cultivated land. (2) Install steel ball bearings on the ground wheels and furrow wheels, changing from sliding to rolling. (3) Add support rods to the tail of the wheel, making the plow tail two centimeters lower than the rear plow heel, so that the tail wheel rolls forward when plowing. (4) Remove the grass deflector plate in areas with less weeds. (5) Remove six centimeters from the tail end of the plow moldboard to reduce the resistance of the plow when moving forward.

The pulling force of the original double-wheel double-share plow was 450 jin, requiring three large livestock to pull it. After the modification, the pulling force is only 230 jin, saving one livestock per plow.

    河南改装双铧犁成功
    据新华社讯　河南省淅川，邓县两地对双轮双铧犁进行了改装，经过试验，效果良好。改装过的双轮双铧犁套上两头一般的牲口耕作，每天可耕地十亩，比改装前的效果提高30％。
    改装的办法是：（一）将前犁头由外侧搬到内侧，缩窄耕地宽度。（二）地轮、沟轮安装钢滚珠，由滑动变为滚动。（三）将轮尾加添支杆，使犁尾低于后犁踵二公分，犁地时尾轮滚动前进。（四）犁草少的地方，去掉挡草板。（五）将犁镜尾端去掉六公分，以减轻犁身前进时的阻力。
    原来的双轮双铧犁的拉力是四百五十市斤，需要三头大牲口拉。改装后拉力只有二百三十市斤，每部可节省牲口一头。
