Amazing Feats

Reading the newspaper sometimes feels like watching a circus performance. For instance, the picture in the March 2nd People's Daily: an eighteen-year-old girl, wearing a colorful jacket and with pigtails, single-handedly operating two double-share plows in the field. The oxen in front are plowing as if on automatic, just like an animal training show in a circus! The girl is showing off her amazing skill! However, the newspaper's publicity isn't about sensationalism, it provokes deep thought: If an eighteen-year-old girl can do this, why can't others? And with so many capable people, what's there to worry about accomplishing? This girl's hometown – Jiaokeng Township, Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province – is going to realize "semi-mechanized production" this year. Doesn't this prove how many capable people there are in the countryside and how much can be accomplished?

Another example is the "ten thousand ewes, ten thousand lambs" (March 2nd People's Daily) of the 28th Ranch of the Xinjiang Military Region Construction Corps. Isn't that like a magic show? The magician covers something with a square scarf, chants some words, and when he lifts it, eggs have turned into chicks, and the audience feels pleasantly surprised. Now, with ten thousand lambs suddenly standing beside ten thousand ewes, wouldn't those who witness the scene be even tens of thousands of times happier? Naturally, "ten thousand ewes, ten thousand lambs" isn't achieved through trickery, but through people's diligent care. This proves that people's wisdom and labor are the great driving force for the Great Leap Forward. (Xin)

    惊人的绝技
    读报，有时竟像是看大马戏团的表演，比如，3月2日人民日报上的一张图片：一个十八岁的姑娘，穿着花袄，梳着双辫，独人驾驭两部双铧犁在耕田，前一犋牛完全像自动在耕作，这不就活像马戏团里的训兽表演？那个姑娘也就显示了自己的绝技！然而报纸的宣传不是猎奇，它引人深思：十八岁的姑娘能如此，别的人为什么不能如此？而有了如此多的能手，又愁什么事办不成？这个姑娘的家乡——浙江省黄岩县焦坑乡今年就要实现
  “半机械化生产”，不就证明了农村里能手之多，办事之大吗？
    又如，新疆军区建设兵团的第二十八牧场的“万羊万羔”（3月2日人民日报），又不活像是魔术表演，魔术家蒙一块方巾，念念有词地揭开来，鸡蛋就变成了小鸡，观众也便不胜惊异地感到了快慰。现在的一万只母羊身旁，突然伫立着一万只羔羊，目睹其景者，岂不更要高兴几万倍。自然，“万羊万羔”不是靠了障眼法，而是靠了人的辛勤照料。这就证明，人的智慧人的劳作，是跃进的伟大动力。（欣）
