Large Peaches Weighing Over a Pound

    People living in Yan'an can eat large peaches weighing over a pound, juicy and sweet. These peaches are produced on a flower and fruit mountain in Xiajucun Village, Yan'an.

    This mountain was a barren, treeless hill twenty years ago. In 1937, a farmer named Mao Haikuan moved here. As soon as he arrived, he began planting fruit trees on the mountain. Over the next ten years, this mountain became a flower and fruit mountain with over a thousand peach and apple trees. The seeds of the large peaches grown on this mountain were also hard-won. In 1939, he learned that the Cai family orchard in Panlong Haiyanjing had large peaches, so he traveled over sixty li and went to great lengths to ask the Cai family for peach tree branches to use for grafting. By 1947, he had grafted over a hundred trees, but most of them were cut down by bandits. Later, he grafted the branches from the remaining trees onto all his peach trees, and only then did he cultivate this orchard of superior peach varieties.

    一斤多的大桃
    住在延安的人们可以吃到一斤多重、汁多味甘的大桃。这种桃出产在延安夏咀村的一座花果山上。
    这座山在二十年前还是个童山秃岭。1937年，有一户叫毛海宽的农民迁到这里。他来了就上山种果树。十年过来，这座山成了一座有千多株桃树、苹果树的花果山。这座山上所生大桃的种子也得来不易。1939年他打听到蟠龙海眼井一家蔡姓果园里有大桃，就跑了六十多里路，费了很多周折，到蔡家讨来了桃树枝条，用来嫁接。到1947年，他共嫁接了一百多棵树，却叫胡匪大部砍掉。后来又把剩下来的树上的枝条再嫁接到他所有的桃树上去，才培育了这座良种桃林。
