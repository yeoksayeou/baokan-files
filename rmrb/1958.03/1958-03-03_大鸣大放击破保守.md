    Daming Dafang to Defeat Conservatism
    Bai Sheng
    Currently, thirty-four universities and colleges in the capital are taking anti-waste and anti-conservatism as the key, further implementing the three "qin" (diligence) principles of running schools industriously and thriftily, engaging in industrial and agricultural production industriously and thriftily, and studying industriously and thriftily, setting off a new high tide of rectification. This is a signal of a great leap forward in higher education.
    At present, the enthusiasm of the masses is very high. Leaders of universities and colleges must be determined to ignite themselves, boldly mobilize the masses, give full rein to their opinions (daming dafang), and engage in great debates to lead this movement well.
    This anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement and the implementation of the three "qin" principles in universities and colleges are a struggle between two paths and two methods of running schools, and also a major event in the reform of higher education. To ensure that this movement is carried out thoroughly, it is necessary to boldly mobilize the masses, give full rein to their opinions (daming dafang), and engage in great debates. Only in this way can the principles and methods of running schools be thoroughly clarified among leaders, teachers, and students, and achieve ideological unity. During the process of giving full rein to opinions (daming dafang) and engaging in great debates, the masses will inevitably come up with various methods through collective wisdom to tap the potential in all aspects to implement the three "qin" principles. Some school leaders feel that they have already given full rein to opinions (daming dafang) and have some methods, so they are busy with "rectification". Of course, it is right to rectify while rectifying, but at the beginning of a new stage of the movement, it is more important to rely on the masses and conduct more in-depth and extensive giving of opinions (daming dafang) again. Waste and conservatism will never be thoroughly investigated in one instance of giving opinions (daming dafang). Some school leaders are not bold enough to ignite themselves and still have ideological concerns about being "excessive" and "losing face" in front of the masses. These concerns are unnecessary. Many past facts have proved that the masses are able to distinguish right from wrong through great debates, and at the same time, the masses have understood the principle of unity—criticism—unity.
    Everything develops and grows stronger in the struggle of opposites. Only by bravely mobilizing the masses and guiding the masses, further giving full rein to opinions (daming dafang) and engaging in great debates, can the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement have a good start and the work can develop rapidly.

    大鸣大放击破保守
    柏生
    目前，首都三十四所高等学校，正以反浪费反保守为纲，进一步贯彻勤俭办学、勤俭生产、勤工俭学的三勤方针，掀起了一个整改的新高潮。这是高等学校大跃进的一个信号。
    目前群众热情非常高涨，高等学校的领导者要决心以引火烧身的精神，放手发动群众，大鸣大放，大争大辩，把这一运动很好地领导起来。
    这次高等学校的反浪费、反保守运动和贯彻三勤方针，是办学的两条道路和两种方法的斗争，也是关于高等学校教育改革的一件大事。要使这一运动进行得彻底，必须放手发动群众，大鸣大放，大争大辩。因为只有这样，才能使办学方针办学方法在领导者、教师和学生中彻底澄清，取得思想上的一致。大鸣大放大争大辩中，通过集体智慧，群众必然会想出各种办法挖掘出各方面的潜力来贯彻三勤。有些学校的领导人觉得过去已经鸣放得差不多了，办法也有一些了，就忙于“改”。当然边整边改是对的，但是在运动的新阶段的开始，更重要的是依靠群众，再次更深入地广泛地进行大鸣大放。浪费保守现象决不会在一次鸣放中就能搞深搞透的。有些学校的领导人引火烧身还不够大胆，仍有怕群众“过火”，怕自己“丢脸”的思想顾虑。这些顾虑都是不必要的。过去的许多事实已经证明，经过大争大辩群众是能够明辨是非的，同时群众也已懂得了团结——批评——团结的原则。
    一切事物都是在对立的斗争中发展壮大起来的，只有勇敢地发动群众，引导群众，进一步大鸣大放大争大辩才能使反浪费反保守运动有一个好的开端，使工作得到迅速发展。
