Grow More Vegetables, Increase Supply
Sun Jian

The supply of vegetables in cities has always been a matter of concern. Since the latter half of last year, thanks to the strengthened leadership of Party and government organs in most regions over vegetable work, the production and supply of vegetables has greatly improved. However, can we say that the vegetable supply problem has been completely solved? Not yet. The development of production still cannot keep up with the growing needs of consumption. From November of last year to May of this year, the amount of vegetables transferred and transported in 21 provinces and cities across the country will reach more than 1.3 billion jin, which is one-half more than the amount transported from November 1956 to May 1957. From November of last year to February of this year, 500 person-times from various regions were sent to the Second Ministry of Commerce to request vegetable allocation. The areas requesting vegetables covered large and medium-sized cities and small county towns. The amount of vegetables requested ranged from over 10 million jin to as little as 100,000 to 200,000 jin. This matter shows that many regions have not implemented the vegetable supply policy of "nearby production, nearby supply, city-wide zoning, and basic self-sufficiency."

Abandoning the near for the far, and relying on long-distance transportation to supply urban vegetables, is the greatest waste. Transporting 1.3 billion jin of vegetables requires an average of 26,000 railcars, with freight alone costing 13.8 million yuan, and losses reaching 100 million jin, worth 4 million yuan. In addition, commercial departments need to use hundreds of employees to engage in transportation work.

Why haven't some places solved the problem of vegetable supply locally? There are ideological problems here.

The most prominent is that many regions have relatively serious conservative thinking. Recently, the Second Ministry of Commerce received vegetable production plans for this year from several provinces and cities. The common feature of these plans is that in calculating the amount of vegetables consumed, they remain stuck in the concept of a few years ago, with an average of a few liang of vegetables per person per day. Baotou City in Inner Mongolia, an important industrial and mining area, has experienced tight vegetable supplies for the past two years, but their plan for this year still only arranges for each person to eat ten liang of vegetables per day. Several provincial-level cities in Fujian, where natural conditions are very good but vegetable prices were generally high last year, only plan for about half a jin per person per day this year. In fact, many regions averaged more than one jin per person per day last year. Many places are always afraid of having too many vegetables. When formulating plans at the beginning of the year, they always demand absolute balance between production and sales, and set very high unit yields. However, vegetables are agricultural products that are extremely susceptible to disaster and reduced production. Therefore, they talk about balance every year, but every year there is a shortage.

Is it better to produce a little more vegetables, or a little less? We believe that a little more is better. With an abundant supply of vegetables, people can eat more vegetables. Eating more vegetables can also save some grain. Moreover, pigs, dairy cows, and poultry can also be fed more vegetables, which can also save some feed. Besides, many areas in the north can only produce vegetables for a little more than half a year. If they don't grow more vegetables during the season when they can grow, the off-season cannot guarantee supply.

Some people say: China is a big place, "if the east is not bright, the west is bright," if I don't have enough here, I'll just transfer from elsewhere. This understanding is also one-sided. Beijing loses 1.2 fen for every jin of Chinese cabbage transferred from Shandong every year; using great effort and spending a lot of money only increases the supply by one or two days, that is, adding a few million jin. Since improving business methods last year, it has been proven that producing more near the city is completely capable of selling more. If production is low, sending people around will not only fail to guarantee supply, but will often lead to nothing.

Some southern cities and small cities do not pay attention to vegetable production. They believe that: the four seasons are evergreen, the natural conditions are good; the population is small, and they can get by without production. However, the facts give this understanding a negative response. Lingishi County in Shanxi, Hengyang in Hunan, and Chongqing in Sichuan all experienced high vegetable prices and tight supplies last year. What is the reason for this? In the final analysis, it is a failure to grasp production. If the production conditions are good but not seriously arranged, allowing it to drift, there will also be tension. Small county towns did not arrange for it in the past, and the consumption quantity was small, so the problem was not prominent. However, everything is developing. Last year, many construction sites suddenly appeared in the Xinxiang area of Henan, and the demand for vegetables increased greatly. Can it be said that there were no problems in the past, and there will be no problems in the future?

Vegetables are non-staple foods that every household cannot do without every day. Our country has many excellent production techniques, and many regions can have two or three harvests a year, and the south can have five harvests or even more. As long as Party and government organs at all levels earnestly strengthen leadership and carefully arrange production, the vegetable problem can definitely be solved quickly and well.

    多种菜  多供应
    孙健
    城市蔬菜的供应，一直是个引人注意的问题。去年下半年以来，由于大部分地区的党政机关加强了对蔬菜工作的领导，蔬菜的生产和供应情况有了很大改进。但是，是不是蔬菜的供应问题就完全解决了呢？还不能这样说。生产的发展，仍然赶不上消费增长的需要。从去年11月到今年5月，全国二十一个省市蔬菜调运数量将达十三亿斤以上，比1956年11月至1957年5月的调运量多二分之一。从去年11月到今年2月，各地派人到第二商业部要求调菜的达五百人次。要菜地区遍及大中城市和小县城。要菜数量多的千万斤以上，少的一二十万斤。这件事情说明不少地区还没有贯彻“就近生产，就近供应，按城划片，基本自给”的蔬菜供应方针。
    舍近求远，依靠长途调运供应城市蔬菜，是最大的浪费。运输十三亿斤蔬菜，平均要占用车皮二万六千个，仅运费一项即需一千三百八十万元，损耗将达一亿斤，值四百万元。此外，还要商业部门用几百个职工去搞运输工作。
    为什么还有些地方没有就近解决蔬菜的供应问题呢？这里有思想问题。
    最突出的就是：不少地区存在比较严重的保守思想。最近第二商业部收到若干省市提出的今年蔬菜生产计划，这些计划的共同特点是在计算蔬菜消费数量时，停留在几年前每人每天平均几两菜的概念上。内蒙古包头市，这个重要工矿区，两年来蔬菜供应一直是紧张的，但他们今年的计划仍只安排每人每天吃十两菜。自然条件很好，但是去年菜价普遍偏高的福建几个省辖市，今年只安排每人每天半斤左右。实际上，去年许多地区平均每人每天都吃一斤以上。不少地方老怕蔬菜过多。年初制订计划时，总要求做到绝对的产销平衡，单位产量打的很高，而蔬菜又是极易受灾减产的农产品。因此，年年讲平衡，年年是不足。
    究竟蔬菜生产多一点好办呢，还是少一点好办？我们认为多一点好办。蔬菜生产充裕了，人们可以多吃菜。多吃菜还可以节约一些粮食。而且猪、奶牛、家禽也都可以多喂菜，这样还能节约一些饲料。何况北方很多地区一年只有半年多的时间才能生产蔬菜，如果不在可以生长蔬菜的季节多种些，淡季就不能保证供应。
    有人说：中国地方大，“东方不亮西方亮”，我这里不够，就向别处调。这个认识也是片面的。北京市每年从山东调运大白菜一斤就赔一分二；用很大力量，花很多钱，也不过增加一两天的供应量，即是多了几百万斤。从去年改进经营方法后，证明在城市附近多产是完全能够多销的。如果生产少了，派人到处跑，不仅供应没有保证，而且往往要落空。
    有些南方城市和小城市不重视蔬菜生产。他们认为：四季常青，自然条件好；人口少，不管生产也可过得去。事实却给这种认识以反面的回击。山西灵石县和湖南衡阳、四川重庆，去年都出现了菜价偏高和供应紧张的情况。这是什么缘故呢？归根到底是没有抓生产。生产条件好不去认真安排，听其自流，也要闹紧张。小县城过去不安排，消费数量小，问题表现不突出。可是，一切事物都是发展的，去年河南新乡专区突然集中出现了很多工地，蔬菜需要量增加很多。难道这能说过去没有问题，今后也没有问题吗？
    蔬菜是家家户户天天不能缺少的副食品。我国具有许多优良的生产技术，许多地区一年可以两熟三熟，南方一年可以五熟甚至更多。只要各地党政机关切实加强领导，认真安排生产，蔬菜问题一定能够又快又好地解决。
