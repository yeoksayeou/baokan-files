    Party Members Take the Lead in "Burning Themselves"
    Beijing Normal University Deepens the "Double-Anti" Campaign Step by Step
    (Our dispatch) The Chinese Communist Party Committee of Beijing Normal University held a school-wide mobilization meeting on the afternoon of March 28, calling on the entire Party to further mobilize and take the lead in self-revolution. He Xilin, the Second Secretary of the University Party Committee, delivered a mobilization report at the meeting.
    Since the start of the "Double-Anti" movement at Beijing Normal University on March 8, over 140,000 big-character posters have been put up within a week. During this period, the big-character posters criticized the work style of leaders at all levels in the university and focused on exposing many instances of waste in manpower and resources. On March 15, the university launched a second upsurge of airing views and contending, with the spearhead of the struggle pointing towards various bourgeois ideologies in teaching.
    During the movement, the University Party Committee and Party organizations at all levels did a lot of ideological work, holding various forums and heart-to-heart talks with veteran teachers, young teachers, and democratic parties, as well as conducting individual conversations to dispel various ideological concerns. With the help of the Party, many veteran teachers confessed their innermost thoughts to the Party, expressing their determination to become staunch leftists and strive for both redness and expertise. However, the flames of the movement had not yet burned deeply enough into the leadership at all levels of the Party Committee and individual Party members.
    Comrade He Xilin called on everyone at the meeting to add more fuel to the fire and burn away the shortcomings and mistakes of organizations at all levels and individual Party members. He called on all Party members to stand at the forefront of the revolution, "burn themselves," and lead the broad masses to push the movement further forward.
    After the meeting, many departments held oath-taking rallies overnight, and democratic parties such as the Jiusan Society also held rectification meetings. Party members and cadres at the department's mobilization meetings took the lead in "burning themselves," reading out big-character posters and examining their own shortcomings. (Hu Xiaozhi)

    党员带头引火烧身
    北京师大双反步步深入
    本报讯　中共北京师范大学委员会，3月28日下午召开了全校动员大会，号召全党进一步动员起来，带头实行自我革命。该校党委第二书记何锡麟在会上作了动员报告。
    北京师范大学的双反运动，自3月8日开始以后，一周内即贴出了大字报十四万余张。这一时期的大字报批评了学校各级领导的作风，并集中地揭露了许多人力、物力上的浪费现象。3月15日该校掀起了第二次鸣放高潮，斗争的锋芒指向教学中的各种资产阶级思想。
    在运动中，该校党委和各级党的组织作了不少思想工作，召开老教师、青年教师、民主党派等各种座谈会、谈心会，并进行个别交谈，解除各种思想顾虑，许多老教师在党的帮助下纷纷向党交心，表示坚决作左派，力争红透专深。但运动的烈火，对党委各级领导和党员个人还烧的不够深透。
    何锡麟同志在会上号召大家再加一把烈火，烧掉各级组织和党员身上的缺点和错误。号召全体党员要站在革命的最前列，引火烧身，带动广大群众把运动再向前推进一步。
    会后，许多系连夜召开誓师大会，九三学社等民主党派组织也召开了整风会议。党员和干部在系的动员会上，纷纷引火烧身，宣读大字报，检查自己的缺点。（胡斅贽）
