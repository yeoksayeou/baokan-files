    Great Friend of the Chinese People
    ——Commemorating the 90th Anniversary of Gorky's Birth
    Ge Baoquan

    "We are brothers in spirit and comrades in aspiration!"
    ——Gorky's letter to Mr. Sun Yat-sen——

    The great revolutionary teacher Lenin once gave Gorky a high evaluation. He said: "Gorky is undoubtedly the greatest representative of proletarian art. He has made many contributions to this art and can make more." He also said: "Gorky, with his great artistic works, closely linked himself with the workers' movement in Russia and the world." These words of Lenin can also be applied to Gorky's relationship with China. To us Chinese people, the name of Gorky is very dear, not only because Gorky's revolutionary and passionate works educated our vast working people, inspired us to engage in heroic revolutionary struggles, and greatly influenced the development and growth of new Chinese literature; but also because Gorky was always concerned about and sympathized with the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle for national liberation. Because of this, we have always regarded Gorky as a great friend of the Chinese people!

    From many related historical materials, it can be seen that Gorky had been interested in China since his childhood. Throughout his life, he cared about our country's anti-imperialist movement of the Yihetuan in 1900 and the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. He was also concerned about our War of Resistance Against Japan and the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. Even from several letters he wrote to the novelist Chekhov and the doctor Srekin in 1900, it can be seen that he then had the desire to visit China.

    In 1900, China's anti-imperialist movement of the Yihetuan began, followed by the invasion of Tianjin and Beijing by the Eight-Power Allied Forces. On July 9 (July 22, according to the Gregorian calendar) of that year, Gorky wrote a letter to Chekhov and made the following suggestion to him:

        Dear Anton Pavlovich!

        Shall we go to China together? Once, in Yalta, you said you wanted to go. Let's go together! I really want to go there, and I plan to recommend myself to a newspaper as a correspondent. My wife is not very willing to let me go alone, but she says that if you can go too, she can be completely reassured about me. Go, dear Anton Pavlovich! It's very interesting there, but it's monotonous here.

    In another letter to Chekhov in the same month (date not specified, estimated to be in the first half of July), Gorky wrote:

    The idea of China is tormenting me. I really want to go to China! I have never wanted anything so strongly for a long time. Don't you also want to travel far—shall we go together? Really go? That would be great!...

    At the end of this letter, Gorky emphatically added a sentence: "Please reply regarding the matter of going to China." Chekhov replied to Gorky on July 12 (25):

    Dear Alexei Maximovich!

    Your invitation to travel to China surprised me greatly. What about that play? What about that play? I suppose you have already finished writing it? In any case, it is too late to go to China, it seems that the war is about to end. If I go there, I can only be a doctor. A military doctor. If the war drags on, then I will go. But now, let's sit down and write something.

    Perhaps after this, Gorky was too busy writing or for some other reason, he failed to realize his plan to come to China. But it can be seen from the letter he wrote to his and Chekhov's common friend—the doctor Srekin—between August 26 and 30 (between September 8 and 12) of that year, that he attached great importance to this anti-imperialist struggle of the Chinese people:

    ...If a real war is declared—then I will go. I will definitely go! I think this war has great significance. If it lasts for 30 years and turns into a big war in Europe, I won't be surprised at all! Alas, why am I not a Chinese! I will show you what civilization is! I will strip off the mask of culture from you! I will...

    In 1911, China's Xinhai Revolution succeeded. On January 1, 1912, Mr. Sun Yat-sen took office as the provisional president and announced the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China. We know that before this time, Gorky had already read the Russian translation of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's "Kidnapped in London" in the Russian Narodnik journal "Russian Wealth," and may have also read another article written by Mr. Sun Yat-sen published in the same journal, "China's Present and Future"; in addition, he read Mr. Sun Yat-sen's "The Chinese Revolution and Social Problems" in the French "Socialist Movement" magazine published in the combined July-August 1912 issue (this article was also published on July 24, 1912, in the Belgian Socialist Party newspaper "Le Peuple," later translated into Russian, renamed "The Social Significance of the Chinese Revolution," and published on July 15 (28), 1912, in the Russian Bolshevik newspaper "?瓦明星报"). Therefore, on October 12 (25) of that year, Gorky wrote a letter to Mr. Sun Yat-sen from Capri Island, where he was recuperating in Italy, expressing his congratulations and admiration to him:

    Respectable Sun Yat-sen!

    I am a Russian, and I am also fighting for the victory of those same ideas that you are fighting for; no matter where these ideas achieve victory,——you and I are happy for their victory. I congratulate you on the successful completion of your work. All honest people in the world are paying attention to this work with concern, joy, and admiration for you, the Chinese Hercules (note).

    In this letter, Gorky pointed out that socialists are people who sincerely believe that the world can and must live a life of friendship and peace, and therefore must do everything possible to oppose all the malicious attempts of our common enemies to promote racial hatred and oppress the people. Finally, Gorky implored Mr. Sun Yat-sen to write an article for the readers of "Modern Man" magazine, in his words: "We must let the Russian people know about the revival of China from the narration of honest Chinese, rather than from the reports of European journalists who are loyal to the interests of capital." Whether Gorky's letter to Mr. Sun Yat-sen is still preserved somewhere in our country; whether Mr. Sun Yat-sen ever replied to Gorky, cannot be verified at present, but from the original manuscript of this letter preserved in the Gorky Museum in Moscow, we can see that Gorky, more than forty years ago, predicted the eternal and deep friendship that is being established today between the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union: "We are brothers in spirit and comrades in aspiration!"

    Just when Gorky was writing to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, he was in charge of editing the "Chronicle of Foreign Life" column of the "Modern Man" magazine. He wrote several commentary articles in each issue, but without signing his name. In the October 1912 issue of "Modern Man" magazine, he published an article he wrote on the development path of the Chinese Revolution, which also quoted the full text of the article written by Mr. Sun Yat-sen for the "Socialist Movement" magazine. Gorky pointed out in his own commentary:

    ...Sun Yat-sen's opinion that China can avoid the disasters of capitalism is a repetition of those populist viewpoints that were propagated in Russia in the 1870s and in Germany in the 1840s, but we can say with full confidence: reality will shatter these viewpoints, and it will be shattered more quickly and more decisively than they were in Germany and Russia.

    Although the comments published by Gorky in this article are only a few short paragraphs, he concisely and succinctly stated here the ideas developed by Lenin in his article "Democracy and Populism in China" written for "?瓦明星报" on July 15 (28) of that year.

    Gorky was also very concerned about the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Second Domestic Revolutionary War waged by the Chinese people. After the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, Japanese imperialists occupied Northeast China. On January 28, 1932, they began to attack Shanghai and slaughter our people. This "unprecedentedly despicable atrocity" (Gorky's words) committed by Japanese imperialists against the Chinese people could not but arouse Gorky's hatred and indignation. When Soong Ching Ling, on behalf of the Anti-Imperialist League, issued an appeal to progressive people, literary, artistic, and scientific representatives around the world, requesting them to support the Chinese people, Gorky's article "Responding to Soong Ching Ling's Appeal" was published in the "Izvestia" on March 2, 1932, which forcefully pointed out:

    Aiding China—the manifestation of proletarian solidarity in the world, is a great cause. Only the proletariat can solemnly say: "Get out of China!"—and can even more solemnly prove: This is not just an empty phrase.

    As a great proletarian writer, Gorky was very concerned about the struggle and fate of Chinese revolutionary writers. When the Kuomintang reactionary authorities in Shanghai killed five young revolutionary writers—Rou Shi, Hu Yepin, Bai Mang, Li Weisen, and Feng Keng—on February 7, 1931, famous writers from all over the world, such as Romain Rolland, Barbusse, and many others, jointly published a public protest against the Kuomintang's cruel white terror. At that time, the first signature on the protest was Gorky's.

    During this period, Gorky was also very concerned about the revolutionary fighters and writers who were fighting arduously in the Chinese revolutionary base areas. When Soviet newspapers published news on September 2, 1934, about the new victories of the Chinese Red Army in Hunan, Gorky wrote an article entitled "To the Revolutionary Writers of China" and read it out at the Chinese Revolutionary Writers' Evening held at the Moscow Trade Union Building that evening. The same article was also published in the "Pravda" on September 3. Gorky wrote at the beginning of the congratulatory message:

    Dear comrades, revolutionary writers of China!

    Today's newspapers published the good news of the new victories of the Chinese Red Army.

    Chinese comrades! On behalf of the Soviet literary world, I congratulate you on your new victories; I am convinced that you will be able to finally defeat the enemy, and I express my admiration for the heroic spirit of the proletarians of your country!

    At the end he wrote:

    Our weapon is language; our responsibility is to better temper ourselves ideologically, to sharpen our language even more, and to make it penetrate into the hearts of the proletariat around the world, becoming their own language.

    Chinese comrades, I send you warm Bolshevik greetings!

    Gorky's congratulatory message is an important document about China that he wrote after writing to Mr. Sun Yat-sen in 1912. After more than 20 years, it still has a very profound significance for us Chinese people and Chinese writers today.

    It is by no means accidental that we Chinese people have always regarded Gorky as our great friend, as many of the historical facts listed above can well prove. We will always cherish Gorky's deep friendship, boundless sympathy and concern for the Chinese people. In the past, they have inspired us to engage in heroic revolutionary struggles; when we are engaged in the great cause of socialist construction today, they will once again inspire us to make great leaps forward!

    中国人民的伟大朋友
    ——高尔基纪念高尔基诞生90周年
    戈宝权
    “我们，在精神上是弟兄，在志向上是同志！”
    ——高尔基给孙中山先生的信——
    伟大的革命导师列宁曾经给高尔基作了很高的评价，他这样讲过：“高尔基，无疑问地，是无产阶级艺术的最伟大的代表者，他为了这个艺术已经作了很多的贡献，并且还可能作出更多的贡献。”他又讲过：“高尔基用他伟大的艺术作品，把自己和俄国及全世界的工人运动紧密地相联系起来。”列宁所讲的这几句话，同样地也可以引用到高尔基和中国的关系上面来。对于我们中国人民，高尔基的名字是非常亲切的，这不仅仅因为高尔基的充满革命激情的作品，教育了我们广大的劳动人民，鼓舞了我们去从事英勇的革命斗争，给予了中国新文学的发展和成长很大的影响；而且还因为高尔基时时刻刻都在关心着和同情着中国人民争取民族解放的革命斗争事业。正因为这样，我们一向就把高尔基看成是中国人民的伟大的朋友！
    从不少有关的史料中可以看出，高尔基远从童年时代起，就对中国发生了兴趣。在他的一生当中，他关心过我国1900年义和团的反帝运动和1911年的辛亥革命，也关心过我们的抗日斗争和第二次国内革命战争。甚至从他在1900年写给小说家契诃夫和医生斯烈金的几封信中，还可以看出他当时有过访问中国的愿望。
    1900年，我国义和团的反帝运动开始，接着是八国联军入侵天津和北京，就在这年的7月9日（新历是22日），高尔基写信给契诃夫，并向他提出了这样的建议：
        亲爱的安东·
    巴甫洛维奇！
        一同到中国去吗？有一次，在雅尔达，您说您很想去。一同去吧！我非常想到那儿去，并且我打算向某家报纸自荐担任通讯记者的工作。我的妻子不大愿意放我一个人去，但是说，假如您也能去，那她对我就可以完全放心了。去吧，亲爱的安东·巴甫洛维奇！那儿很有趣，可是这儿却单调无味。
    在同月给契诃夫的另一封信中（日期未注明，估计在7月的上半月），高尔基又写道：
    中国的念头在折磨着我。非常想到中国去！很久以来，我从没有这样强烈地想望过什么事。您不是也想到远地去旅行——一同去吗？真去吗？那就好极了！……
    在这封信结尾的地方，高尔基又着重附加了一句：“去中国的事，务请回复。”契诃夫在7月12日（25日）就复了高尔基一封信：
    亲爱的阿列克赛·马克西莫维奇！
    您邀我到中国去旅行，使我大吃一惊。那个剧本呢？那个剧本怎么样？大概您已经把它写完了吧？无论怎样，到中国去是太迟了，看起来，战争已快结束。要是到那儿去，我只能当一个医生。当一名军医。假如战争延长下去的话，那我就去。可是现在还是坐下来，稍微写一些东西。
    也许在这以后，高尔基为了写作忙或是其他什么原因，未能实现到中国来的计划，但从他在当年8月26日至30日之间（9月8日至12日之间）写给他和契诃夫的共同的朋友——医生斯烈金的信中可以看出，他是非常重视中国人民的这次反帝斗争的：
    ……要是真正宣战——那我就去。一定去！我认为这次战争具有巨大的意义。假如它要延长到30年，变成为全欧洲的大混战，那我一点也不会吃惊！唉，为什么我不是一个中国人！我要让你们看看什么是文明！我要从你们身上剥下文化的假面具！我要……
    1911年我国辛亥革命成功，1912年1月1日孙中山先生就任临时大总统之职，并宣布中华民国临时政府成立。我们知道，在这时候以前，高尔基已经从俄国民粹派的机关刊物“俄国财富”上，读到孙中山先生所写的“伦敦蒙难记”的俄译，可能还读过同一刊物上发表的孙中山先生写的另一篇文章“中国的现在和将来”；此外又从1912年7—8月份合刊的法文的“社会主义运动”杂志上读到孙中山先生写的“中国革命与社会问题”一文（这篇文字又曾发表在1912年7月24日比利时社会党的报纸“人民报”上，后被译成俄文，改名为“中国革命的社会意义”，发表在1912年7月15日（28日）俄国布尔塞维克的机关报“?瓦明星报”上）。于是高尔基就在当年的10月12日（25日）从他在意大利养病的地方——喀普里岛，写了一封信给孙中山先生，对他表示了祝贺与钦佩：
    尊敬的孙逸仙！
    我是一个俄国人，也正为着您所奋斗的那些同一思想的胜利而斗争；不管这些思想在什么地方取得胜利，——我和您都为它们的胜利而感到幸福。我祝贺您的工作的美满成功，世界上一切正直的人士，都怀着关切、高兴和对您这位中国的赫尔古里斯（注）的敬佩的心情，注意着这个工作。
    在这封信中，高尔基指出：社会主义者是真诚相信世界可以、而且一定能够过着友爱与和平的生活的人们，因此要竭尽一切努力，反对我们共同的敌人助长种族仇恨和压迫人民的所有恶毒的企图。最后高尔基恳请孙中山先生为“现代人”杂志的读者写一篇文章，用他的话来说：“我们必须让俄国人民从正直的中国人的叙述中，而不是从那些为资本的利益效忠的欧洲新闻记者的报道中来认识中国的复兴。”高尔基写给孙中山先生的这封信，是否还保存在我国什么地方；孙中山先生曾否复信给高尔基，现俱无法查考，但我们从莫斯科的高尔基博物馆所保藏的这封信的原稿当中，可以看出高尔基远在四十多年以前，就预言了今天在中苏两大国人民之间所建立起来的永恒的深厚的友谊：“我们，在精神上是弟兄，在志向上是同志！”
    就在高尔基写信给孙中山先生的时候，他正负责编辑“现代人”杂志的“国外生活纪事”栏。他每期都写几篇评论的文章，但不署名。就在1912年10月号的“现代人”杂志上，发表了他所写的一篇论中国革命发展道路的文章，其中并引用了孙中山先生为“社会主义运动”杂志所写的那篇文章的全文。高尔基在自己的评论中指出：
    ……孙逸仙的意见，说中国可以避免资本主义的灾害，正是在七十年代的俄国和四十年代的德国所宣传过的那些民粹主义观点的重复，但是我们可以满怀信心说：就是现实将会粉碎这些观点，并且要比它们在德国和俄国被粉碎时来得更迅速、更坚决。
    高尔基在这篇文章中所发表的评论，虽然只是短短的几节，但他在这里简明而扼要地讲出了列宁在当年7月15日（28日）为“?瓦明星报”写的“中国的民主主义与民粹主义”一文中所发挥的思想。
    高尔基对于中国人民所进行的抗日斗争和第二次国内革命战争，也是非常关心的。1931年“九一八”事变后，日本帝国主义者侵占了我国东北，1932年1月28日又开始进攻上海，屠杀我国人民。日本帝国主义者对中国人民所施加的这种“空前卑劣的暴行”（高尔基语），不能不引起高尔基的憎恨和愤慨。当宋庆龄代表反帝大同盟向全世界的进步人士、文学、艺术和科学界的代表人士发出呼吁请求他们声援中国人民时，1932年3月2日的“消息报”上就发表了高尔基的“响应宋庆龄的呼吁”的文章，其中有力地指出：
    援助中国——世界无产阶级团结的表现，是一件伟大的事业。只有无产阶级能够威严地说出：“滚出中国！”——能够更加威严地证实：这并不是一句空话。
    作为一位伟大的无产阶级作家，高尔基是非常关心中国革命作家的斗争和命运的。当1931年2月7日国民党反动当局在上海杀害了柔石、胡也频、白莽、李伟森和冯铿等五位青年革命作家时，世界各国著名的作家如罗曼·罗兰、巴比塞等许多人，曾联名发表了公开的抗议书，反对国民党的残酷的白色恐怖，当时在抗议书上第一个签名的，就是高尔基。
    就在这个时期，高尔基也非常关心在中国革命根据地进行着艰苦奋斗的革命战士们和作家们。当1934年9月2日苏联的报纸上发表了有关中国红军在湖南取得新的胜利的消息时，高尔基写了一篇“致中国的革命作家们”的文章，并于当晚在莫斯科工会大厦举行的中国革命作家晚会上宣读。同一篇文章，也发表在9月3日的“真理报”上。高尔基在贺词的一开头就写道：
    亲爱的革命中国的作家同志们！
    今天的报纸发表了有关中国红军的新的胜利的喜信。
    中国同志们！我代表苏联文学界，庆贺你们获得新的胜利；我深信你们一定能够最后战胜敌人，谨对你们国家的无产者们的英勇精神表示崇敬！结尾时他又这样写道：
    我们的武器，是语言；我们的责任，就是要在思想上更好地锻炼自己，把我们的语言磨炼得更加锋利，并且使它深入到全世界无产阶级的心灵中去，成为他们自己的语言。
    中国同志们，向你们致热烈的布尔塞维克的敬礼！
    高尔基的这篇贺词，是他在1912年写信给孙中山先生之后所写的一个关于中国的重要的文献，时隔二十多年，但在今天读起来，它对于我们中国人民和中国作家们依然具有着非常深刻的意义。
    我们中国人民一向把高尔基看成是我们的伟大的朋友，这决不是偶然的，从上面所列举的许多史实，就可以得到很好的证明。我们将永远珍贵着高尔基对中国人民的深厚的友谊和无限的同情与关切。在过去，它们曾经鼓舞过我们从事英勇的革命斗争；当我们今天从事伟大的社会主义建设事业时，它们又将鼓舞着我们向前作大步的跃进！
