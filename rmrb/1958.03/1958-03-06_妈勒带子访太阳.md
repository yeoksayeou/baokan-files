Mother Le Daizi Visits the Sun (A Zhuang Folk Legend)

    In the past, we Zhuang people knew that there was a sun in the sky, that the sun rose from the east, and that the survival and reproduction of all things depended on the sun. But at that time, the sun's rays could not reach us Zhuang people!

    At that time, it was as dark as night during the day in our place. There was no sunlight, no warmth, just a gloomy world, full of tigers, leopards, and wolves. People were killed beyond count. It was impossible to eliminate these beasts of prey in the dark, so it was necessary to choose someone to go to the sun to complain.

    As soon as the idea of choosing someone to go to the sun was mentioned, everyone fought for it, all wanting to go.

    First, an old man in his sixties stood up and said to everyone:

    "I'll go. Anyway, I'm old and can't do much farm work, but I can still walk. I can do this job."

    "No, I'll go. I'm strong and can walk eighty kilometers a day. I'll be at the sun soon," a strong middle-aged man jumped out of the crowd.

    Then, many strong young men and women came out to offer their conditions. Everyone said they could go and guaranteed a quick round trip.

    "I say no!" a boy of about ten years old shouted sharply and said: "I say grandpa, uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters can't go. Because the sun is not something we can reach in forty or fifty years; it may take eighty or ninety years. I'm young, so it's more reliable for me to go."

    As soon as he finished speaking, everyone started talking at once:

    "The child is right."

    "It's better for the child to go."

    "Everyone stop, everyone stop!" A pregnant woman in her twenties, named Mother Le, shouted, waving her hand.

    Everyone fell silent. She said, "That child is right, the sun is far away from us. But in my opinion, eighty or ninety years is probably not enough time to reach it. Besides, people have difficulty walking when they are eighty or ninety years old, so it's better for me to go. First, I'm strong and not afraid of high mountains or dangerous ridges, nor am I afraid of poisonous snakes or wild beasts; second, I'm pregnant, and the road I can't finish can be continued by my child."

    Everyone agreed. So they decided to let her go, instructing her to light a fire to signal as soon as she reached the sun.

    She set off. She walked east, and after walking for more than eight months, she gave birth to a strong baby boy. She took the child with her. As she walked, she walked for seventy years, her feet became heavy, and she could hardly lift them. She stopped at a farmer's house and told her child to go on his own.

    In the seventy years of their journey, the mother and son encountered tens of thousands of mountains, tens of thousands of rivers, and tens of thousands of poisonous snakes and tens of thousands of wild beasts. They went through countless hardships and difficulties, countless sorrows and pains, and risked their lives countless times. But they were able to overcome all of them. First, they were both strong and could cross high mountains and dangerous ridges and resist poisonous snakes and wild beasts. Second, they met people everywhere, and the people they met, hearing that they were going to visit the sun, sincerely helped them. When they encountered high mountains and dangerous passes, people escorted them over. When they encountered large rivers, boats ferried them across. People also sent clothes and shoes for them to wear and prepared food and dishes to entertain them.

    As for the people at home, since Mother Le set off, they had been looking to the east every morning, hoping to see a big fire burning. But after waiting for ten years, they still didn't see any fire. After waiting for twenty years, they still didn't see any fire. After waiting for thirty years, forty years... seventy years, they still didn't see any fire. Everything was still the same as before: no sunlight, no warmth, a gloomy world, full of tigers, leopards, and wolves.

    Everyone thought that she had died on the road long ago and that there was no hope.

    One day more and it would be a hundred years. Who would have thought that just one quarter of an hour before the sun was about to rise today, a red fire burned in the east, filling half the sky. Then the red sun rose, shining brightly on our Zhuang people's land, shining so brightly that even the hills and rivers reflected ten thousand beams of golden light. The tigers, leopards, and wolves that had been raging for thousands of years were eliminated one by one by us from then on.

    In order to commemorate Mother Le and her son, from that time until now, every morning when the east turns red, our Zhuang working people go to the fields to work. In the evening, we don't stop working until the red curtain hangs in the west.

    妈勒带子访太阳（僮族民间传说）
    从前，我们僮族也知道天上有太阳，也知道太阳是从东方升起来，还知道万物的生存和繁殖都靠太阳。可是那时候太阳的光线是射不到我们僮族这里的呵！
    那时候，我们这里白天也像黑夜一样，没有阳光，也没有温暖，是个阴森森的天地，到处都是虎豹豺狼，被害的人可没法数。想在黑夜里消灭这些猛兽那是不行的呵，这样就非选人去找太阳作主不可了。
    一提到选人去找太阳，大家就你争我夺，个个都想去。
    首先一个六十多岁的老公公站出来对大家说：
    “我去，反正我年纪老了，做田工也做不了多少了，但我还能走，这工作我做得。”
    “不，我去，我身强力壮，一天能走一百六十里，很快就能到太阳那里去。”一个健壮的中年男子从人群中跳出来。
    接着，很多健壮的男女青年都出来摆他们的条件。个个都说自己能去，还保证速去速回。
    “我说不！”一个十岁左右的男孩很尖的叫了一声，就说：“我说老公公、伯叔、婶婶、哥哥、姐姐们都不能去。因为太阳离我们不是四五十年就能走到的，也许要走八九十年才行。我年纪小，还是我去才可靠。”
    他的话刚落音，众人就你一句我一句地说开了：
      “小孩说的有道理。”
      “还是小孩去的好。”
      “大家停一停，大家停一停！”一个二十岁左右的孕妇叫妈勒的，边挥着手边叫着。
    大家都不作声了。她说：“那小孩说的很对，太阳离我们很远。但依我看，八九十年的时间恐怕还是走不到的，况且人到了八九十岁走路就困难了，还是我去的好。因为一来我身强力壮，不怕高山峻岭，也不怕毒蛇猛兽；二来我怀有孕，我走不完的路可由我孩子继续走。”
    大家听了都赞同。于是就决定让她去，嘱咐她一到太阳那里就烧火报讯。
    她出发了。她一直向东走，走了八个多月就生下了一个结实的男孩子。她带着孩子一同走。走着，走着，一直走了七十年，她的脚笨重起来了，几乎举不起了，她才在一个农民的家里停下，叫她的孩子自己去。
    七十年的路程，她母子俩遇着千千万万座大山，遇着千千万万条大河，还遇着千千万万条毒蛇和千千万万只猛兽。这里边不知经过了多少艰难困苦，不知经过了多少辛酸苦辣，也不知冒了多少次生命危险。但是他们都能通过了。因为一来他们都身强力壮，能跨过高山峻岭，能抵御毒蛇猛兽，二来他们到处都碰着人，而所碰着的人，听说他们要去访太阳，个个都诚心帮助他们，遇着高山险隘就要人护送他们过去，遇着大江大河，就要船渡他们过去；日常还送衣服送鞋给他们穿，作饭作菜招待他们。
    再说在家的人，自从妈勒出发以后，他们每朝都望着东方，想看大火烧起来。可是望了十年，总看不到半点火影。望了二十年，也看不到半点火影。望了三十年、四十年……七十年，还是看不到半点火影。一切还是和从前一样：没有阳光，也没有温暖，阴森森的一片天地，到处都是虎豹豺狼。
    大家都以为她早在路上丧命了，没有什么希望了。
    再过一天就得一百年了，谁还想到就在今天太阳要升的前一刻钟，东方烧起了红通通的半天大火。接着火红的太阳升起了，亮堂堂地照到了我们僮族的地方，照得连山岗连江河都反射出了万丈金光。疯狂了几千年的虎豹豺狼，从此就一个一个地被我们消灭了。
    为了纪念妈勒母子俩，从那时候起，直到现在，我们僮族劳动人民每朝东方一发红就都到地里去工作了。傍晚，直到西方挂起了红幕才收工。
