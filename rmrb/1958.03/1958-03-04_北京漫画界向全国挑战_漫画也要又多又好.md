Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd. Beijing cartoonists, more than thirty people, gathered on the afternoon of the 3rd to discuss the Great Leap Forward plan. The atmosphere at the meeting was enthusiastic, and cartoonists eagerly set out their individual creation plans. Hua Junwu, Mi Gu, Ying Tao, Jiang Yousheng, Miao Yintang, Wang Letian, Ding Wu, and others all planned to create 300 cartoons (including cartoon illustrations) in 1958, almost one a day. Other cartoonists planned to create from dozens to two hundred works. The twenty-four cartoonists who participated in setting plans projected a total of 4,695 cartoons to be created this year. The meeting also proposed conditions for creation, mass guidance work, and exhibition work, challenging the nation's cartoon circles. Their conditions are: In terms of creation, in addition to a large quantity, each person should set out a plan to be completed on a regular basis, but also ensure that cartoon creation is rapid and timely, closely coordinated with current political tasks for propaganda; among them, satirical cartoons should achieve accuracy and clarity of satire; at the same time, efforts should be made to achieve nationalization and popularization of the works. Strengthen mass cartoon guidance work. Sixteen cartoonists present at the meeting signed up to participate, including Hua Junwu, Mi Gu, and other seven cartoonists who, in addition to lecturing at the Mass Art Museum, will also individually focus on guiding twenty worker-cartoon enthusiasts; the "Cartoon" bi-monthly magazine decided to double the mass creation page from the 120th issue. Beijing cartoon circles also decided to establish two cartoon guidance "experimental fields" in factories, mines, and rural areas in the suburbs of Beijing this year. Strengthen cartoon exhibition work. In 1958, Beijing cartoon circles will organize two cartoon exhibitions. In the first half of the year, they will rush to compile a "Great Leap Forward" cartoon exhibition and reproduce multiple copies for touring exhibitions across the country.

The meeting also removed Ding Cong, a rightist, from his position as deputy leader of the cartoon group of the Chinese Artists Association; Hua Junwu, Mi Gu, Ying Tao, Zhong Ling, and Li Cunsong were re-elected to form a cartoon group working committee, responsible for the organizational work of the Beijing cartoon circles.

    北京漫画界向全国挑战
    漫画也要又多又好
    新华社3日讯
  3日下午，北京漫画界三十余人集会讨论大跃进计划。会场情绪热烈，漫画家们纷纷订出个人创作计划，华君武、米谷、英韬、江有生、缪印堂、王乐天、丁午等人都计划在1958年创作漫画（包括漫画插图）三百幅，将近每天一幅。其他漫画家创作数十幅到二百幅不等。参加订计划的二十四位漫画家计划今年创作的漫画总数达四千六百九十五幅。会上还就创作、群众辅导工作及展览工作等提出条件，向全国漫画界挑战。他们的条件是：在创作方面，除数量要多，每人订出计划定期完成外，还要保证漫画创作迅速及时地密切地配合当前政治任务进行宣传；其中讽刺性的漫画要作到讽刺的正确性和鲜明性；同时还要力求作品的民族化和通俗化。加强群众漫画辅导工作，到会漫画家有十六人当场报名参加，其中华君武、米谷等七位漫画家除在群众艺术馆讲课外，还要个别重点辅导二十位职工漫画爱好者；“漫画”半月刊决定自第一百二十期起，将群众创作版面增加一倍。北京漫画界还决定今年内在京郊厂矿及农村建立两个漫画辅导“试验田”。加强漫画展览工作，1958年北京漫画界将组织漫画展览两次，上半年突击编出一辑“大跃进”漫画展览，复制多份送全国各地巡回展出。
    会议还撤销了右派分子丁聪所担任的中国美术家协会漫画组副组长职务；重新推选了华君武、米谷、英韬、钟灵、李寸松五人组成漫画组干事会，负责北京漫画界组织工作。
