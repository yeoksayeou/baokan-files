    Rapid Progress in Afforestation Campaign in Twelve Southern Provinces
    120 Counties to be Greenified This Spring
    (Our dispatch) As of February 25th, according to incomplete statistics from twelve provinces including Anhui and Hunan, which have already started afforestation, the spring afforestation has completed over 45 million mu, accounting for 70% of the national afforestation plan for 1958.

    The three provinces of Anhui, Hunan, and Guizhou have been progressing at a rate of 500,000 mu per day before and after the Spring Festival. In Jiangsu Province, over 1.3 billion trees were planted around houses and along roadsides in two months. Anhui Province's afforestation plan was expanded from 2.5 million mu to 4.4 million mu, then further expanded to 8.8 million mu. By February 25th, this final plan was also surpassed, and it is now advancing towards 10 million mu. Hunan Province's revised afforestation plan of 9.4 million mu has also been exceeded. By February 21st, 10.7 million mu had been completed, and it is now advancing towards 15 million mu.

    During the greening campaign, a large number of cooperatives carrying out large-scale afforestation have emerged in various places. According to statistics from Anhui and Hunan, there are more than 3,000 cooperatives afforesting over 1,000 mu. In Hunan and Guizhou provinces, there are more than 5,000 townships and cooperatives that have achieved comprehensive greening. In Yuexi County, Anhui Province, there are eighteen cooperatives with 10,000 mu of forests each. In Sinan County, Guizhou, and the Miao Autonomous County of Da Miao Shan in Guangxi, afforestation has been completed on more than 800,000 mu, greenifying the entire county. According to the plans of Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Zhejiang, and Henan provinces, 120 greenified counties will emerge this spring. These counties will ensure that each cooperative afforests 1,000 mu, and each township afforests 10,000 mu. Hubei Province has also proposed that each cooperative establish a forest farm to achieve afforestation in all seasons and accelerate the greening of barren mountains.

    Recently, eleven provinces including Hunan and Guangdong have revised their original plans, deciding to complete the tasks originally planned for ten years within three to five years.

    The quality of afforestation in various places is also satisfactory. This spring, Sinan County, Guizhou, inspected the afforestation of thirteen cooperatives, and 95% met the quality requirements. In Hengyang and Xiangtan Special Districts of Hunan Province, inspections of Masson pine and Chinese fir planting showed that over 90% met the technical specifications. In Lingbi County, Anhui, the willow cuttings planted along the thirty-mile-long highway not only met the technical requirements but also achieved neatness and beauty.

    南方十二省造林运动突飞猛进
    一百二十个县今春绿化
    本报讯　截至2月25日，据已开始造林的安徽、湖南等十二省的不完全统计，春季造林已完成四千五百多万亩，占全国1958年造林计划的70％。
    安徽、湖南、贵州三省春节前后每天以五十万亩的速度向前进展。江苏省在两个月里，四旁植树完成十三亿多株。安徽省的造林计划由二百五十万亩扩大到四百四十万亩，再扩大到八百八十万亩，到2月25日这个最后的计划又被突破，现正在向一千万亩跃进。湖南省经过修订的造林九百四十万亩的计划也已超过，到2月21日已完成一千零七十万亩，现正向一千五百万亩跃进。
    绿化运动中，各地不断出现大量的大面积造林的合作社。据安徽、湖南统计，造林在千亩以上的社有三千多个。湖南、贵州两省，出现全面绿化的乡和社五千多个。安徽省岳西一县有十八个万亩林社，贵州思南、广西大苗山苗族自治县完成造林都在八十多万亩以上，绿化了全县。据湖南、贵州、广西、浙江、河南五省的规划，今春将出现一百二十个绿化县，这些县将做到社社造林千亩，乡乡造林万亩。湖北省并提出社社建立林场，做到四季造林，加速绿化荒山。
    最近，湖南、广东等十一个省修改了原订规划，把十年完成的任务，决定在三年、五年内来完成。
    各地造林质量也令人满意。今春贵州思南县检查十三个社的造林，95％合于质量要求。湖南省衡阳、湘潭两专区检查所植马尾松和杉木，90％以上达到技术规程要求。安徽灵璧县长达三十里的公路两边，插的杨柳条，不仅合于技术要求，而且还达到整齐美观。
