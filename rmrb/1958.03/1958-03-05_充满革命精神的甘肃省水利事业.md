Gansu Province's Water Conservancy Undertakings, Full of Revolutionary Spirit
By our reporter Gu Lei

                      (Continued from yesterday)
    (III) Adapting to Local Conditions, Launching a Thousand Arrows
    The geographical conditions, rainfall, climate, water sources, degree of drought, and methods of water conservancy vary greatly across Gansu. Some areas are extremely arid, some are generally arid, and a few places even experience flooding. This creates a complex situation, making it impossible to find a universal method to achieve water conservancy. Furthermore, the large area, heavy tasks, and small population create acute contradictions.
    How should this work be led? Should it be done locally, in a small-scale manner, or should a comprehensive, nationwide water conservancy campaign be organized? This seems like a matter of working methods, but in essence, it is a question of ideology. Because two different approaches represent two different leadership ideologies. This is a test of the Gansu Party organization, testing whether it dares to declare a full-scale war against drought.
    Gansu Province adopted a bold and comprehensive approach. In order to launch a water conservancy movement from every corner, the Provincial Party Committee repeatedly instructed Party organizations at all levels to go deep into reality, understand and grasp the natural characteristics and laws of each region, fully mobilize the masses, adapt to local conditions, fully utilize the "Five Waters" (rainwater, river water, groundwater, snow water, and ice water), utilize all possible conditions, advance simultaneously, bloom everywhere, create thousands of experiences throughout the province, use facts to establish the idea of "man will conquer nature," and launch a massive water conservancy movement. Over the past few years, all types of regions in the province have found a relatively complete set of methods for water conservancy construction.
    The first category is the "Hexi Corridor" and the Yinchuan area, which require large-scale irrigation. The rainfall here is only a few dozen millimeters per year; without water, there is no grain. The water source relies on the Yellow River and the snow water from the Qilian Mountains, which presents many contradictions. When water is needed, the water volume is insufficient; when it is not urgently needed, a large amount is lost, resulting in serious waste. To date, there are still large tracts of fertile wasteland that cannot be cultivated due to lack of water, and the soil of existing cultivated land has become severely salinized. The water conservancy task in this area is to increase water sources and reduce waste, store water and drain water, use water economically, leach alkali and drain salt, and prevent salinization. Yinchuan's methods include: digging ditches to drain groundwater, lowering the groundwater level, improving the soil, preventing salinization; renovating canals to reduce breaches in the canal banks, so as to avoid water loss; straightening old canals to improve irrigation efficiency; increasing the number of branch canals to reduce the size of land plots and increase the irrigation area. In the Hexi area, the effective methods include: investing a large amount of labor days to line the canals with pebbles to prevent snow water seepage; building low-lying reservoirs to store winter and spring surplus water for the needs of wheat in May and June; drilling a large number of free-flowing wells and semi-free-flowing wells to utilize groundwater and make up for insufficient surface water; leveling the land, reducing the size of land plots, and increasing the number of branch canals and field ditches to increase irrigation efficiency; implementing canal rotation based on crop types, concentrating water for irrigation, and reducing unnecessary irrigation water losses.
    The second category is the Bailong River and Xihan River basin area, that is, the Yangtze River basin south of the Qinling Mountains. The climate is warmer, and most of the area is mountainous with rocky terrain. The rivers are rapid, with an annual rainfall of 500 to 700 millimeters. The water source is abundant, mostly in the mountains. The temperature is lower and the rainfall is higher in the mountains, while the temperature is higher and the rainfall is lower in the river valleys. This creates the characteristics of "flooding becomes a river, drought becomes a mountain, neither drought nor flood becomes a half-mountain." In order to ensure a good harvest on the mountaintops, mid-slopes, and foot of the mountains, this area has also found effective methods: taking drainage and soil conservation measures on the mountaintops, digging drainage ditches to drain excess rainwater, reducing crop damage from flooding, and protecting the soil; digging ditches on the mid-slopes to intercept and divert small mountain streams, building connecting mountain ponds and small reservoirs to store summer and autumn rainwater for irrigation of terraced fields on the mid-slopes; opening canals in the river valleys to divert water to develop paddy fields and increase the multiple cropping index; building dikes to reclaim land along the shallowæ»©areas of the Bailong River to expand the cultivated area. Through these measures, it is possible to both resist drought and prevent flooding.
    The third category is the southeastern hilly plateau area, including the Wei River basin in the Pingliang and Tianshui areas and the southern part of Linxia. Eighty to ninety percent of the cultivated land here is dry land, and soil erosion is very serious. The annual rainfall is between 400 and 500 millimeters, often concentrated in the autumn. Because the rainfall here is not too little, the masses generally have a fluke mentality of relying on the heavens and do not have the habit of building paddy fields. The main measures now being adopted are: opening canals to divert stream water up the mountains; developing terraced fields and digging ponds to store water; building small reservoirs on small streams and rivers to store water for irrigation; drilling a large number of wells in the river valleys and universally developing water lifting irrigation.
    The fourth category is the central arid area, including the Dingxi area, the Gu'yuan and Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefectures, and the Yongjing and Dongxiang counties of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture. The annual rainfall here is less than 300 millimeters, and even if it falls at the right time, it cannot meet the growth needs of crops. Water sources are extremely scarce everywhere, and soil erosion is particularly serious. There are very few rivers in the area, and most of the few small rivers are bitter water, which cannot be directly used for irrigation. Some counties even have difficulty with drinking water. This is the most arid area in Gansu, with 29 counties and cities, 550 townships, 1.85 million people, and 18.45 million mu of land frequently affected by disasters. In this area, water conservancy construction is particularly difficult, and there are particularly many methods: building field ridges and terraces to allow rainwater to infiltrate locally and increase soil moisture content; building leak-proof lined reservoirs to collect every drop of spring water and stream, using the method of small accumulation and large release to increase water land; searching for water sources everywhere in all river valleys, drilling a large number of wells, and widely using lifting tools to expand irrigation; in areas where both surface water and groundwater are scarce, building water cellars that can prevent seepage, evaporation, and retain water, storing autumn and winter rainwater and snow water, which are used to water the land the following year; in the rainy season, using floods and mountain streams to flood the fields, increasing the land's drought resistance; in winter, millions of people brave the cold to carry ice and snow to the fields to ensure spring planting; using furrow irrigation, small furrow irrigation, drip irrigation, and simple sprinkler irrigation methods to save water; vigorously developing sandy fields for drought resistance; advocating harrowing the land after irrigation to preserve moisture and prolong the land's drought resistance time; drilling deep wells and terrace wells, and universally using deep groundwater.
    From this, we can see that water conservancy work in Gansu is complex and arduous. At the same time, we can also see that after the comprehensive campaign, the people of Gansu have created thousands of methods for water conservancy construction in different regions. If drought is the most ferocious enemy of agriculture in Gansu, then the farmers of Gansu are determined to defeat this enemy by launching a thousand arrows. In this process, various typical examples have emerged in various regions, accelerating the pace of water conservancy construction. Taking the most arid Dingxi area as an example, before liberation, there were only more than 360,000 mu of water land. Due to the adoption of various methods for water conservancy construction, there are now more than 1.61 million mu of paddy fields. The average yield per mu of grain in the entire area has increased from 75 jin at the time of liberation to 136 jin in 1957. This year, the original plan was to build 540,000 mu of water land, but it has now increased to 2.24 million mu, and a plan has been proposed to achieve water conservancy in two years. The Dingxi area is a tall indicator of water conservancy in the province, and the time for water conservancy in other regions will only be shorter and not longer than that of Dingxi.
  (IV) Seven Combinations, Comprehensive Transformation
    Because mountainous areas account for 70% of the total area of Gansu, forest area accounts for only 6.4%, and soil erosion area accounts for nearly 50% of the total area of 530,000 square kilometers, the water conservancy construction work is further complicated. This situation sharply raises another question: facing this fragmented natural landscape, should water conservancy be carried out in isolation, or should various tasks be arranged starting from fundamentally changing the natural landscape at the same time as water conservancy construction? This is the dividing line between advanced plans and backward plans. Whether this question can be handled correctly is also a test of whether the Gansu Provincial Party Committee has revolutionary courage, whether it has the belief to overcome nature, and whether it has a strong desire to benefit the future generations of people once and for all. In a word, whether it has revolutionary drive.
    Gansu Province has taken a grand approach: starting from fundamentally changing the natural landscape, it has carried out a comprehensive plan, concentrated management, and comprehensive utilization. In order to accelerate the speed of transforming nature, they scientifically organized this work using the following methods:
    First, combine water conservancy construction with soil and water conservation and afforestation of barren mountains. The large amount of soil and water loss is an important cause of drought. Without maintaining soil and water, it is impossible to eliminate drought; because a large number of canals are opened to divert water, water sources are insufficient everywhere. Carrying out soil and water conservation and planting a large number of trees and forests can greatly increase water sources. In the past few years, these three tasks have been comprehensively combined in Gansu. This is a practice of fundamentally changing the face of nature according to the law of soil and water being connected and plants and trees growing together. As of the end of last year, the province had controlled soil and water loss in an area of 37,200 square kilometers, accounting for 16% of the loss area; afforestation and greening of mountains and ridges totaled 11.48 million mu, accounting for 1.43% of the total area. The labor days invested in this area are approximately 46.38 million. In this way, the day of realizing water conservancy is also the day of eliminating the harm of soil erosion and greening barren mountains, that is, the day when the natural face of Gansu Province is fundamentally changed.
    Second, combine large-scale projects with medium and small-scale projects. In the past few years, Gansu Province has resolutely implemented the central government's guiding principle of water conservancy construction of "small-scale projects as the main focus, medium-scale projects as auxiliary, and large-scale projects being built when necessary and possible." As a result, on the one hand, the speed of water conservancy construction has been accelerated under the condition that the state cannot invest a large amount, and cadres and the masses have been educated that Gansu can vigorously carry out water conservancy. On the other hand, it has also greatly facilitated the mobilization of the masses to participate in water conservancy construction more widely, because medium and small-scale projects have simple technology, small investment, and fast construction, and can generate benefits in the same year. In essence, this is a policy of relying on the masses to run water conservancy undertakings. Gansu Province has performed very prominently in this regard. Among the 8.01 million mu of new water land built during the first five-year plan period, 5.58 million mu were built with investment from the masses.
    Third, combine current interests with long-term interests. Whether it is water conservancy construction or soil and water conservation, there are long-term plans, focusing on fundamentally transforming the natural landscape, and also paying attention to the benefits of the current year. For example, the famous Dongliang Canal first had a plan to irrigate 30,000 mu of land and realize water conservancy in Dongliang Mountain, and used this vision to encourage farmers to start construction. During the construction process, it was carried out in two steps. The first step was to divert water to the mountain first, so that nearly 1,000 mu of land would benefit first, allowing the masses to see the benefits of building the canal; then the entire plan was realized. Another example is the "three-layer interlocking slope protection method" created by Dengjiabao in soil and water conservation work, which is also a typical example. Farmers first dig ditches and ridges on barren slopes, plant sour thorns, then sow sweet clover, and also plant soybeans in between. These three lines of defense can not only permanently prevent soil and water loss, but also harvest soybeans in the first year, cut sweet clover to feed livestock in the second year, and cut sour thorns as firewood in the third year. The biggest advantage of this combination is that the burden on the masses is small and it is easy to accept. Through many measures that can quickly obtain benefits, the realization of long-term plans is guaranteed. This is also the practice of focusing on the big picture, starting with the small details, combining the big and the small, from small to large, and "accumulating fur to make a robe."
    Fourth, combine cultivating typical examples, key demonstrations, and comprehensive promotion. This is a method of coming from practice and going back to practice, from point to surface, and typical examples driving the general. Because this is a new task and everyone has no experience, the province generally grasps four tasks for any type of typical example: key cultivation, organizing visits, continuous improvement, and comprehensive promotion. Taking the Tianshui area as an example, there were only three key points of this type in 1952, but by 1957 there were 367. Another example is Dengjiabao. Because the whole province paid attention to spreading their experience, more than 2,500 "Dengjiabao" have emerged, and it has been proposed that there will be more than 15,000 "Dengjiabao" in the province in 1958. Now, the whole province has all kinds of banners and can cite any representative experience for promotion.
    Fifth, combine construction and maintenance, comprehensive campaigns and perennial management. The vigorous development of water conservancy and soil and water conservation work is unprecedented in the past, and the workload is very large. When repairing, managing, and maintaining, a lot of labor is needed, which to a certain extent contradicts agricultural production. Some agricultural cooperatives often neglect one thing or the other due to improper arrangement of labor, disrupting the agricultural production plan, or causing poor engineering quality and waste, or causing some semi-finished water conservancy projects to collapse, which to a certain extent affects the enthusiasm of farmers. In order to solve this contradiction, 184 agricultural cooperatives in Gangu County have established perennial infrastructure construction teams, with a total of 7,924 laborers, accounting for 9.06% of the county's labor force. When there are large projects, more labor is organized to complete them in a concentrated manner. Small projects and daily maintenance tasks are contracted by the infrastructure construction team. The benefits of establishing a perennial infrastructure construction team are: making water conservancy and soil and water conservation work regular, eliminating seasonality; rationally arranging labor, no longer disrupting the agricultural cooperative's production plan; strengthening the management of completed projects so that they can function year-round; facilitating research, summarizing, creating, and promoting experience; creating reasonable construction quotas, eliminating idling and waste; due to specialization, it can concentrate forces to study and improve technology, ensuring project quality; the infrastructure construction team is a school for training peasant technicians anytime and anywhere, and can train more peasant technicians. This experience is being promoted throughout the province. The generalization of this experience will effectively strengthen the perennial construction of water conservancy and soil and water conservation, which can both consolidate existing achievements and continue to move forward.
    Sixth, combine private operation and public assistance. In the past, large-scale and technically complex projects were invested by the state. Medium and small-scale projects were mostly built by the masses through fundraising. Because the enthusiasm of the masses for water conservancy construction is very high, some large-scale projects have also been undertaken. Projects of this type sometimes encounter difficulties in terms of economy and technology. At this time, using the method of private operation and public assistance can do many more things. For example, the Beiyuan Canal built in Linxia County irrigates more than 90,000 mu of land and requires a total investment of more than 4 million yuan. It was quickly built with the state's assistance of 2 million yuan. Another example is the 300-li-long Beiliang Canal being built in Wushan, which needs to pass through the Wei River and requires the construction of an "inverted siphon." The province is prepared to provide technical and material assistance, which will also speed up the progress of the project. As a result, on the one hand, the state's funds can be used in the most urgent places and play a greater role; on the other hand, it can further encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation.
    Seventh, combine water conservancy, soil and water conservation with fundamentally controlling gullies,æ´æ²»renovating channels, and fully utilizing field ridges, open spaces, pond edges, riveræ»©land, improving saline-alkali land, and expanding cultivated area. In the past few years, through water conservancy and soil and water conservation, the cultivated area has been expanded by hundreds of thousands of mu (excluding reclamation), and another 2 million mu will be expanded in the next ten years. In this way, through water conservancy and soil and water conservation, not only has the existing cultivated land been improved, but also the grain planting area has been expanded, turning many abandoned lands into useful ones and increasing the income of the people. This is also an important condition for transforming the face of nature, because the utilization rate of the entire land area has been improved. (To be continued)
